00:43.460 --> 00:46.327
- No one will hear us.
- Be quiet.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.130
Pull down your panties.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.819
SEPTEMBER 23rd

01:12.906 --> 01:14.396
Go.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.371
Go now, they'll ruin me!

01:23.709 --> 01:27.623
- I can come back when you like, sir.
- Good morning!

01:28.839 --> 01:31.422
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.054
<i>Basso!</i>

01:41.810 --> 01:42.845
Good morning.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.229
Are you and Veronica free
next weekend?

01:46.440 --> 01:49.649
A friend has invited me sailing,

01:49.860 --> 01:52.727
but I get bored on my own!

01:52.904 --> 01:55.646
I don't know, I'll find out
then let you know.

01:55.824 --> 01:59.567
You're a sailor,
don't you miss the sea?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.819
All right.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.121
<i>Basso!</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:14.832
Good morning.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.171
Well, am I late?

02:23.435 --> 02:25.847
Testing, one, two, three.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.014
You know what Goethe said
before dying?

02:30.233 --> 02:32.144
"More light."

03:19.950 --> 03:21.532
Good evening.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.208
Good evening, ladies.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.041
The magazine "Noi"...

03:35.424 --> 03:39.418
is set to become the nation's
favorite weekly,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.422
especially for the nations' women.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.801
I wanted the cover
of the first issue to be a mirror...

03:45.016 --> 03:49.305
- Will they buy this magazine?
- Let's hope so.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.853
Italians need to rekindle
their enthusiasm!

03:52.023 --> 03:55.015
Look at yourselves in that mirror
and smile!

03:56.027 --> 03:57.984
Yes, that's great!

03:58.196 --> 04:00.187
Smile.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.195
Times are hard, I know,

04:03.410 --> 04:09.031
but if the "company of Italy"
was entrusted to a businessman

04:09.249 --> 04:13.038
capable of successfully managing
his own enterprise...

04:13.253 --> 04:15.244
He's brilliant, dammit!

04:15.714 --> 04:19.423
In 5 years it could be great again!

04:20.218 --> 04:21.708
Really great!

04:27.934 --> 04:29.140
Congratulations!

04:32.773 --> 04:34.184
Excuse me.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.612
Raffaella Grandi, congratulations.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.241
You're the new manager
of the Mainaghi group.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.284
Who are you?

04:48.246 --> 04:51.830
- What's going on?
- You've replaced Corbi.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.499
You should've known that one day

04:53.627 --> 04:56.415
the police would pay you a visit.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.916
Now you're the new scapegoat.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.748
I'm no such thing.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.833
I've worked for Mainaghi
for twenty years

05:03.053 --> 05:06.637
and he's never asked me
to do anything illegal.

05:06.848 --> 05:11.467
Maybe because until now you've
not dealt with Zenit pharmaceuticals.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.263
I don't know what you mean.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.608
They distributed contaminated blood.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.237
- You're sure you know nothing?
- Let me go!

05:24.449 --> 05:26.816
You seem like a decent person.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.620
You don't have to believe me,
check for yourself.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.123
The plasma you used
for the blood products.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.455
You can do it.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.501
It won't cost you anything.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.721
I blame it on Heather Parisi
and her first TV program.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.639
That inspired me.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.845
I used to steal my mum's shoes
and raise my leg like Parisi did.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.198
You're good!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.913
Know how Parisi got her first job?

06:15.125 --> 06:18.243
By dancing on the desk
of one of Rai's managers.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.252
As long as it's on the desk...

06:22.591 --> 06:26.630
Listen, Veronica, you'll be presenting
a game show now.

06:26.845 --> 06:31.339
But if you were to play a game, where
would you see yourself in five years?

06:31.850 --> 06:34.057
Oh, God, in five years...

06:35.896 --> 06:38.638
- How scary, I'll be thirty.
- There, you see?

06:38.857 --> 06:42.145
- I officially hate you now!
- Sorry.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.569
Don't worry,
that was Cuccarini's answer too.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.442
They all pass through here,
before becoming famous.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.899
Carlucci, Parietti, Simona Tagli...

06:51.453 --> 06:53.785
I baptized them all.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.989
- I know, I read all your interviews.
- Good girl.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.417
So you'll know there's a question
you can't avoid.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.166
Do you have a boyfriend?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.835
No, I'm single.

07:12.057 --> 07:16.142
"Berlusconi's going against the tide,
too much pessimism", front page.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.728
"Italy, so many internal enemies.
Berlusconi accuses catastrophists,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.314
along with businessmen,
who hide their mistakes,

07:22.442 --> 07:26.652
while Fininvest's president
is optimistic about recovery."

07:26.821 --> 07:28.812
- Did you see the cartoon?
- No.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.989
It's brilliant, Amato is saying:

07:31.201 --> 07:33.818
"If my painful maneuver fails,
I'm leaving.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.529
Let's see if there's someone
optimistic enough

07:36.623 --> 07:40.582
to bravely lead a government
that sheds no tears or blood."

07:40.794 --> 07:43.206
And behind him you see Berlusconi,

07:43.380 --> 07:46.122
with the Fininvest logo
and the caption: "Why not?"

07:48.259 --> 07:50.717
Tears and blood for them,
optimism and smiles for us.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.045
Optimism is good for business.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.215
I'll leave you to work, goodbye.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.802
- Why can't we be honest?
- Meaning?

08:02.607 --> 08:05.895
Berlusconi wants to enter
the world of politics.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.315
Berlusconi?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.909
"TV Sorrisi e Canzoni" mentions
his wedding to Veronica Lario,

08:15.036 --> 08:17.653
but there's a strange survey inside.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.664
Here: "If Silvio Berlusconi
founded a national League

08:24.879 --> 08:28.247
that proposed to run the country
in a better way,

08:28.383 --> 08:33.219
more than one out of two Italians
would support him." It was 1990.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.639
So Berlusconi's wanted to become
a politician since 1990?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.639
Maybe he's not sure yet,
but he's thinking about it.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.017
- He's attended conventions all year.
- That's normal.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.312
It would be if he talked about
the product, instead of his country.

08:47.527 --> 08:51.316
A country that's without a leader
and I'm paying you to find out

08:51.364 --> 08:53.025
who the hell that will be.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.405
I reckon it'll be Martinazzoli.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.329
Forlani is ruined, Martinazzoli
will be the next party secretary.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.413
Try to meet him.
But this time stay at home, Notte.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.039
No more bloody nonsense.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.548
And no more bloody whores.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.058
We'll die as Christian Democrats.

09:29.027 --> 09:33.737
You know what kept us going
in the Gulf War? Cocaine!

09:33.823 --> 09:36.941
With a yacht like this,
you'll know about cocaine, right?

09:37.035 --> 09:41.199
A friend of mine was intercepting
the Iraqis' calls in the Gulf.

09:43.875 --> 09:48.335
One day he intercepted a call
between a Colombian and an Arab.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.628
So he reported it.

09:51.049 --> 09:54.383
He said that two days later
there'd be a cocaine deal.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.052
You know what the commander said?

09:59.349 --> 10:03.058
That my team had to go there
to steal the cocaine and the money.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.265
He gave the order, then what?

10:08.858 --> 10:10.849
We went there.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.393
Everything went smoothly.

10:13.655 --> 10:17.023
We disarmed them,
we were returning with the goods...

10:17.242 --> 10:20.530
when a shot was fired from a window.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.239
It was a hitman, or someone
on the lookout, fuck knows.

10:26.084 --> 10:30.043
We returned fire immediately,
but Russo was already down.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.042
He was one of us.

10:33.842 --> 10:36.049
We took him back,
but he died soon after.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.586
I'm sorry.

10:40.849 --> 10:45.639
At the military tribunal we had to say
that it had been Russo's idea.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.346
The commander forced us to,
we had no choice.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.019
But at the hearing, I shamed him.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.812
I said that he'd given the order.
That I didn't do that shit.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.108
They made you pay for that.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.533
Dishonorable discharge.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.412
It was my word against that
of the others.

11:09.627 --> 11:14.372
- You did the right thing, well done.
- The right thing?

11:14.632 --> 11:18.216
He was kicked out,
his friend's family got nothing...

11:18.386 --> 11:21.799
The right thing depends
on the situation.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.214
No.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.306
Our friend Bosco here
acted like a man.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.853
Shit, I like your friend.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.809
- What do you do?
- I'm a businessman.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.894
Didn't Gaetano tell you?

11:37.113 --> 11:38.820
I produce arms.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.158
- Arms?
- Yes.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.620
Excuse me... How's it going?

11:55.048 --> 11:58.837
Well... Arnaldi, you don't need
to feel offended.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.628
We've guzzled enough,
it's time to cut back now.

12:02.847 --> 12:06.636
Don't worry, attorney,
soon it'll be harvest time.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.432
Goodbye.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.227
NLC Arms.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.734
Shit!

12:18.321 --> 12:22.406
The Defense Committee is meeting
to reduce military expenditure,

12:22.659 --> 12:26.948
and funnily enough, your friend
Locetra would lose his arms contract.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.528
What a coincidence.

12:28.748 --> 12:33.663
You didn't know how to thank me
for helping Veronica, right?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.582
Well now you do.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.007
Goodbye.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.385
- Come on, let's go!
- What's going on?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.259
Let's go.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.437
- Tell me what's happened.
- Do you trust me?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.440
Yes.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.690
Let's go.

13:05.868 --> 13:10.157
<i>They've created an awful tension.</i>

13:10.415 --> 13:14.625
<i>Craxi visits the Brescia cemetery
where Moroni's body is laid out.</i>

13:14.836 --> 13:16.622
<i>After paying homage to the coffin...</i>

13:16.838 --> 13:20.047
- I wasn't sure you'd come.
- Neither was I.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.795
- What else do you want?
- Have you read it?

13:23.803 --> 13:28.138
Have you? The last two words say:
"No culprits."

13:28.308 --> 13:30.140
Those who caught HIV don't agree.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.850
They're all cases from before 1985,
before HIV testing of plasma existed.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.806
The tests for Hepatitis C
have only been around for three years.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.518
Of course.
That's the official version.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.402
Listen, I feel bad for those people,
but I can't help them.

13:46.326 --> 13:51.162
- As you've nothing else to say...
- I'm one of those people.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.119
I've got HIV.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.124
I contracted it with blood from Zenit.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.836
About a year ago.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.838
All right.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.595
I'll check.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.399
- Sir, did you want to see me?
- Venturi!

14:28.659 --> 14:32.243
Get me the Milan-Serravalle
highway files.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.371
Wait, take these others down.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.914
Who's going to meet Martelli,
you or all of us?

14:41.047 --> 14:44.540
It's best you go alone,
I'm no good at secret meetings.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.628
So you're meeting the minister, sir?

14:50.056 --> 14:53.390
Maybe he'll give us Craxi
then take his place.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.805
- Mum's the word, got it?
- Of course.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.685
Call Fenati.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.031
I don't know why we play along
with your farces.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.234
Someone here is talking, believe me.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.953
They're spying on us too.

15:16.165 --> 15:20.409
So now, what do we say to Fenati?

15:21.838 --> 15:25.832
<i>Silvio, I wanted to ask you,
you're a successful man all round,</i>

15:26.050 --> 15:31.591
<i>you're an inspirational speaker,
ever thought of being a politician?</i>

15:32.723 --> 15:35.636
<i>No? Who shouted that?</i>

15:36.644 --> 15:41.389
<i>I have certainly never dreamed of</i>

15:41.649 --> 15:47.019
<i>working for any of the political
parties we know of, not ever.</i>

15:48.406 --> 15:51.444
<i>But you might consider it,
maybe in the future...</i>

15:51.701 --> 15:54.614
<i>Everyone should stick
with what they're good at.</i>

15:54.829 --> 15:58.367
<i>Allow me to use alliteration,
I consider myself a do-er</i>

15:58.583 --> 16:02.417
<i>so let me do the job I'm good at:
I'm a businessman.</i>

16:08.259 --> 16:09.920
<i>You're a person who...</i>

16:17.226 --> 16:20.014
What's going on?
Why are you in Milan?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.220
I'm doing a seminar.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.643
- I thought you read leftist mags.
- It's my neighbor's.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.061
Go to page 36.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.659
Page 36, further ahead!

16:41.918 --> 16:43.374
Shit!

16:43.586 --> 16:45.623
"One hundred girls from
'Non è la Rai'.

16:45.755 --> 16:49.293
Viola is 14, she likes shopping,
Kurt Cobain and guys with tattoos."

16:49.383 --> 16:54.048
There's even a ballot to send off
with your favorite girl.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.008
Why are you using this tone?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.641
- Because it's your fault.
- My fault?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.219
She spent six months with you

17:02.396 --> 17:04.512
and I no longer recognize her.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.849
Maybe it's you who raised her
surrounded by sadness.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.644
Viola said
you never let her do anything.

17:10.820 --> 17:15.406
But she was doing well at school,
she did fencing, read Dostoevsky.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.694
Yesterday I found a note from
one of her male classmates that said:

17:18.829 --> 17:20.444
"LUV U 2."

17:20.580 --> 17:23.915
She's a minor, they have
to ask your permission, say no!

17:24.126 --> 17:26.834
You know I'm not that kind of parent.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.250
Viola shouldn't go on TV
because it's humiliating.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.378
- Not because I say no.
- Of course, so?

17:33.219 --> 17:36.302
- You caused this, you deal with it.
- Me?

17:36.806 --> 17:39.173
I'm sorry, I don't have time.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.228
At first I was considering a Porsche.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.224
But a guy I know has one

17:49.652 --> 17:52.110
and I don't want to be
the same as him.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.398
Then... I was enlightened.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.610
BMW 850.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.239
A classic car,
with a fantastic engine, a V12,

18:04.417 --> 18:07.830
5000 cc, 300 hp.

18:08.045 --> 18:13.256
It's a comfortable, executive car
that races like a missile.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.546
144 million liras.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.220
Is your information worth it?

18:22.059 --> 18:24.426
Our dear Minister of Justice

18:24.687 --> 18:26.849
will have a secret meeting
with Di Pietro,

18:27.023 --> 18:29.014
to screw over Craxi.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.853
Well?

18:32.236 --> 18:33.772
Is it a deal?

18:38.159 --> 18:41.823
<i>Other HIV sufferers contacted me,
they contracted it with transfusions.</i>

18:41.954 --> 18:46.243
<i>They read the article and want to
send a petition to the authorities.</i>

18:48.294 --> 18:51.832
<i>They said that Clean Hands
has restored their faith in justice.</i>

18:52.048 --> 18:55.382
<i>- Will you go back to your job?
- It's unlikely.</i>

18:56.594 --> 18:58.631
<i>Won't you tell me what happened?</i>

18:58.763 --> 19:02.301
<i>I have to go, I'm interviewing
Moroni 's daughter, what a crappy job!</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:04.678
- Bye, Giuliani.
- <i>Bye.</i>

19:16.364 --> 19:18.651
<i>- Giuliani?
- Luca.</i>

19:19.033 --> 19:23.823
<i>It's Raffaella Grandi, come to Zenit
tomorrow, I've got news.</i>

19:29.835 --> 19:31.542
Good morning.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.205
I'm here to see Raffaella Grandi.

19:37.259 --> 19:41.298
I found the files relating to
the purchase of the plasma.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.300
I was told they didn't exist.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.221
I pressed management for
information and they listened.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.227
Management?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.638
You wanted answers...

20:00.825 --> 20:03.066
Leave us alone, please.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.415
- You look surprised.
- This seems like an ambush.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.618
Like the one you set for my brother?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.832
By the way,
thanks for getting me fired.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.291
What did you expect?

20:20.511 --> 20:23.128
- Sit down.
- No, thanks, I'll stand.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.100
What is it?

20:30.730 --> 20:34.018
- Proof you understood jack shit.
- About you?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.224
I already knew that.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.643
You wanted an enemy...

20:39.822 --> 20:42.154
shame you got the wrong person.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.612
Lemures?
Who the hell are they?

20:46.036 --> 20:50.826
The company who sold us the blood
and told us they'd checked it.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.408
Read it, it's all written there.

20:55.421 --> 20:58.334
Yes, it also says
the company's based in Barbados.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.001
It's easy to blame them.
Maybe they don't even exist.

21:03.137 --> 21:07.722
They do, we launched a lawsuit
against them three years ago.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.641
This is the letter from their lawyers.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.393
Do you see what happened, Luca?

21:16.650 --> 21:21.190
My father started a lawsuit
against those who sold him the blood.

21:21.363 --> 21:25.573
He didn't know that the blood
was contaminated, he was innocent.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.408
You did all this for nothing.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.415
You chose the wrong enemy, Luca.

21:47.598 --> 21:52.343
Three months ago you were a stoner
now you look like Sally Spectra.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.640
You become what you do.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.641
It's your fault.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.316
I've been blamed
for too many things recently.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.395
Why? What else have you done?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.401
My daughter.

22:10.621 --> 22:14.239
After spending some time with me
she's become a TV showgirl.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.327
- You have a daughter?
- Never mind.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.368
Everything I touch turns to shit.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.545
Are you calling me shit?

22:21.340 --> 22:23.297
Metaphorically speaking.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.046
Anyway, you've not touched me yet.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.050
What are you doing?

22:30.391 --> 22:31.802
Are you teasing me?

22:33.561 --> 22:36.019
You saved me, Leo.

22:36.230 --> 22:39.222
I spent my life waiting for
someone to save me

22:39.400 --> 22:42.233
and help me understand
what I should do.

22:42.403 --> 22:47.022
Maybe you see people's secret
potential and make it blossom.

22:48.242 --> 22:51.405
Basically, you're a kind of fertilizer.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.030
Now you're calling me shit!

23:09.305 --> 23:12.093
- <i>Hello?</i>
- The Christian Democrats are ruined!

23:13.225 --> 23:17.310
<i>- Let's find new men.
- Where?</i>

23:17.771 --> 23:19.637
Northern League.

23:20.566 --> 23:24.230
<i>I don't know, they seem too uncouth
to govern Italy.</i>

23:25.863 --> 23:28.855
<i>Notte, I sense you are about
to ask me something.</i>

23:29.408 --> 23:32.025
Can I arrange a meeting
with Formentini?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.235
<i>If you have time to waste...</i>

23:46.717 --> 23:48.378
Be quiet!

23:48.802 --> 23:52.170
<i>The CD has met to consider
the resignation request</i>

23:52.348 --> 23:54.180
<i>made by secretary Forlani.</i>

23:54.308 --> 23:57.221
Up yours, Christian Democrats!

23:58.812 --> 24:00.598
Go home, goddammit!

24:05.819 --> 24:07.776
Do you miss your job?

24:07.947 --> 24:10.609
There's a long list of things
that I miss...

24:10.699 --> 24:12.781
You don't usually
feel sorry for yourself.

24:13.285 --> 24:17.404
It's not every day that you realize
you've got it all wrong.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.040
I just wanted to get revenge.

24:21.627 --> 24:24.369
Now I don't even know who to blame.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.371
Actually, I do know,

24:27.633 --> 24:29.670
it's a company in Barbados!

24:32.846 --> 24:35.087
There's nothing I can do about it.

24:35.349 --> 24:39.217
The Italian justice system
doesn't allow you to investigate.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.854
If there's nothing you can do,
don't beat yourself up about it.

24:54.326 --> 24:59.071
The Jackie '0 club
will put up a sign saying:

24:59.289 --> 25:01.826
"Northern League members not allowed."

25:02.334 --> 25:06.248
Salvetti was the first to run
when the bouncers arrived!

25:06.380 --> 25:09.042
To touch his ass, how gross!

25:09.299 --> 25:12.041
Holy shit! How embarrassing!

25:17.016 --> 25:20.225
I know him,
isn't he a Christian Democrat?

25:21.395 --> 25:24.387
I saw him talking to you
the other day.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.931
He lives in the flat above mine.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.108
Well, yes!

25:31.655 --> 25:35.239
I'm really happy
you're one of us now.

25:35.409 --> 25:38.071
My instincts were right,
weren't they?

25:44.668 --> 25:47.035
- Goodnight, Borto.
- Wait!

25:47.254 --> 25:51.168
- Wait for what?
- Wait, what's the hurry?

25:51.633 --> 25:53.419
We never see each other.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.006
Yes, we do.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.384
I know, but not like this,
just the two of us.

26:04.396 --> 26:08.264
I know why you were
at the faggot beach that day.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.230
I'm not dumb.

26:11.403 --> 26:15.818
- Look, I don't...
- Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.235
You like taking it up the ass?
That's your damn problem.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.446
I've got other tastes.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.535
Don't ever touch me again
or I'll hurt you.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.745
Understood?

26:31.048 --> 26:32.334
Yes.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.841
- Are you fit to drive?
- Yes.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.226
See you in Parliament tomorrow.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.901
SEPTEMBER 29th

27:01.995 --> 27:03.906
Mantua was a success, Of course.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.957
But in a few months it's Milan,
then Rome, for the elections.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.873
Northern League.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.921
Who south of Florence would vote
for a party with that name?

27:18.637 --> 27:21.299
We don't care about what's
south of Florence.

27:22.391 --> 27:26.430
When it started out, Coca-Cola
was an anti-fatigue tonic.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.636
It was sold at the chemist's.

27:28.856 --> 27:33.441
By mistake someone added
sparkling, not still water to it.

27:33.652 --> 27:37.020
The rest is history,
it just needed bubbles.

27:37.239 --> 27:41.233
You're saying we should add
bubbles to the Northern League?

27:41.660 --> 27:45.904
A bit of restyling could make
your niche product a mainstream one.

27:46.707 --> 27:47.742
Mainstream?

27:49.668 --> 27:52.035
You Berlusconi guys are all the same!

27:52.254 --> 27:56.623
You know what they call you?
"The army of plastic men."

27:57.634 --> 27:59.625
You're only good at selling.

27:59.845 --> 28:02.712
But that's not what we need.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.638
You need a leader.

28:04.850 --> 28:08.218
Bossi is good, but he's only relevant
to a part of Italy.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.929
Who do you propose? II Cavaliere?

28:11.899 --> 28:15.312
He's from Lombardy like you,
but all Italians like him.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.485
I'm going.

28:19.656 --> 28:23.024
- I know the way out.
- Well, think about it!

28:23.243 --> 28:24.608
About what?

28:25.829 --> 28:28.446
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.969
Is it a bad time?

28:46.266 --> 28:48.052
Well?

28:48.769 --> 28:51.431
Did you think about that offer?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.223
It's a no-go.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.235
Locetra's arms suck.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.655
The Northern League just wants
to cut military expenditure.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.440
The Northern League!

29:05.702 --> 29:09.195
I don't do this Christian Democrat
bullshit.

29:10.457 --> 29:14.246
You've learnt to be a team member,
that's a shame.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.416
For Veronica, I mean.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.831
That girl is giving it her all...

29:21.426 --> 29:23.633
This isn't about Veronica.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.053
It's about me and you, Pietro.

29:27.224 --> 29:30.717
You were a wreck,
I did you a favor

29:30.936 --> 29:32.847
which boosted your morale.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.228
You asked me what you could do
in return.

29:35.440 --> 29:40.435
But obviously your moral doubts
only arise when it's your turn to help.

29:42.823 --> 29:46.862
- What the hell are you saying?
- That I can make another call.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.957
I seem to have forgotten my manners,
do forgive me.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.227
Shall we call Balzamo in?

30:23.447 --> 30:26.439
His name's been mentioned by
Zamorani, Rovelli,

30:26.658 --> 30:28.649
but we'll need time to verify
the facts.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.036
Let's call him in as a witness
and put some pressure on him.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.329
Sir, Minister Martelli is on the phone.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.158
I'll put him through.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.413
Minister Martelli.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.717
I'm sorry.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.679
I have no idea
who spread that rumor.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.635
What secret meeting?
Of course not!

30:57.230 --> 30:58.937
All right.

31:02.444 --> 31:03.855
So it's Venturi.

31:16.124 --> 31:20.618
- You're leaving already?
- Today's not a good day.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.999
What's up? Did the Beast bite you?

31:23.215 --> 31:26.253
The Minister of Justice called,
he's furious.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.463
With Di Pietro?

31:28.678 --> 31:33.047
Someone leaked news about them
meeting in order to get rid of Craxi.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.842
- Do they know who that was?
- No.

31:36.061 --> 31:38.018
But the Minister
was enraged with him!

31:38.230 --> 31:40.892
So this meeting never happened?

31:41.066 --> 31:42.898
Of course not!

32:02.421 --> 32:05.504
- Hi.
- I'm pleased that you came.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.384
- Why are you here?
- I was in Rome for work.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.595
Your mother is furious.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.598
I've come to take you home.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.060
I thought you'd be happy at least.

32:21.064 --> 32:24.022
Didn't you say that studying
was of no use?

32:24.234 --> 32:26.942
- I said it after I got my degree.
- In Philosophy.

32:27.070 --> 32:30.483
- Yes.
- It's a miracle you've got a job.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.485
Miracles don't happen.

32:32.701 --> 32:36.239
What a drag, dad!
You've always preached about freedom!

32:37.831 --> 32:40.072
Was that just your freedom?

32:40.876 --> 32:44.710
Viola, you're not doing this stuff,
end of story.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.079
Go and get changed.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.551
Listen...

32:56.892 --> 33:01.807
this "stuff", as you call it,
is what I've always loved.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.972
I was just embarrassed to say it.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.227
It's not your fault,
it's thanks to you.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.445
I've realized I was born to do this.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.533
I've always had it inside me,
but I just didn't see it.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.195
You were born to be a TV showgirl?

33:20.582 --> 33:21.788
Viola...

33:22.000 --> 33:25.413
- Girls, we're on in 30 seconds.
- I have to go.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.795
Wish me luck at least.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.970
Viola, hurry up!

33:42.062 --> 33:45.771
- Here I am, sorry.
- ls that your father?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.151
Why the hell are you here?

33:57.827 --> 34:01.570
- I'm looking for Venturi.
- So are we.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.485
Did you know him well?

34:35.364 --> 34:37.572
I thought so.

34:39.995 --> 34:44.455
We've found lots of copies
of our documents here.

34:47.543 --> 34:51.003
I just know he always needed money.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.178
Shut that goddamn bird up, please!

35:03.602 --> 35:06.720
How do I know you and Venturi
aren't working together?

35:07.772 --> 35:10.309
You've fired me,
now you'll arrest me?

35:11.860 --> 35:15.649
Come on, you shouldn't be here,
we're doing a search, go!

35:18.867 --> 35:23.987
Go to headquarters tomorrow
and give Davigo a statement, okay?

35:33.882 --> 35:37.295
- Gambling debts, right?
- So he said.

35:37.510 --> 35:41.378
Venturi went undercover in Bologna
years ago, did you know?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.422
No.

35:43.642 --> 35:47.886
He's not lost the habit of playing
on several tables at the same time.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.395
Shame, he was really nice.

35:51.608 --> 35:55.192
And what were you playing at,
Pastore?

35:55.403 --> 35:59.192
The stunt you pulled in Switzerland
could've landed us all in trouble.

35:59.407 --> 36:03.492
If I'd got there a few hours earlier
it'd be a different story.

36:03.662 --> 36:07.371
And if I'd listened to the CIA,
maybe they'd have taken me to Larini.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.407
Didn't you hear?

36:09.584 --> 36:12.793
American subjects
said they would be willing

36:13.004 --> 36:16.588
to get him from the Bahamas
and bring him to us.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.792
- A great trap, right?
- What if it were true?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.378
You'd have Craxi by now.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.588
We don't take short-cuts.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.675
We are the law, remember that.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.602
And we'll get Craxi all the same.

36:30.980 --> 36:34.189
You know who Di Pietro is questioning
next door?

36:34.401 --> 36:36.187
Vincenzo Balzamo.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.394
Socialist Party treasurer.

36:38.613 --> 36:42.607
We've come up with a theory
about his method.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.617
The bank managers
take the kickbacks,

36:45.787 --> 36:48.404
transfer the money
to the account holders

36:48.581 --> 36:52.791
then give it to the Socialist Party,
without them knowing.

36:53.002 --> 36:56.996
We don't have any proof,
but Balzamo doesn't know yet.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.957
And he may decide to talk.

37:01.803 --> 37:03.635
You can go, Pastore.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.806
- Good day to you.
- Thanks.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.103
Luca!

37:19.154 --> 37:20.610
Bye, Giuliani.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.270
L-Hi.

37:22.490 --> 37:26.154
So the blood from Lemures...
are they to blame?

37:26.619 --> 37:27.984
Yes.

37:30.707 --> 37:35.201
- Does this company actually exist?
- I asked myself the same thing.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.003
But evidently they do,
there's a lawsuit.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.042
Well, so much for that.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.216
My first big investigation
has come to a halt.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.635
Shit, it's Balzamo! Bye.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.176
I can't...

37:49.392 --> 37:51.383
I can't talk!

37:51.811 --> 37:54.929
It's confidential, I can't.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.392
- Sir, please!
- Why isn't this lift working?

37:59.611 --> 38:02.399
So that we can ask you
some questions.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.864
The Socialist party's dying, Craxi
and Martelli are at war, and you?

38:05.992 --> 38:08.984
Nonsense!
They're like husband and wife.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.195
They're pretending.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.803
Who are you?

38:37.774 --> 38:39.560
I work for Di Pietro's team.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.644
What do you need?

39:14.018 --> 39:17.602
They have the same lawyer.
You know why?

39:18.398 --> 39:20.810
They're just pretending to fight.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.809
Zenit and Lemures are the same thing.

39:23.987 --> 39:29.403
<i>I've done some research too,
I have important news for you.</i>

39:29.617 --> 39:31.574
All right.

40:39.604 --> 40:44.314
We're voting for the approval
of the NLC grenade order.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.015
Who's in favor?

40:51.908 --> 40:54.775
In favor: 13. Against: 11.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.069
Approved.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.582
- Good evening, Mr. Bosco?
- Yes.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.458
Goodbye.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.138
FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP, NLC

42:43.478 --> 42:45.810
You know what Formentini says?

42:46.230 --> 42:48.562
That you're an army of plastic men.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.187
An army? Cool.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.612
Dell'Utri made us read
"The Art of War."

42:55.782 --> 42:59.195
Really?
He gets everyone to read that!

43:07.460 --> 43:09.792
- Shit.
- What?

43:11.380 --> 43:13.997
Why look outside for new men?

43:14.217 --> 43:16.174
The future is here.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.629
NEXT TIME

43:55.716 --> 43:58.253
You won't miss out on anything.

44:02.974 --> 44:05.887
You give me the money
and I'll give you the proof.

44:34.463 --> 44:37.171
- A ticket to Havana.
- Return?

44:37.925 --> 44:38.881
Just one-way.

44:39.305 --> 44:45.550
