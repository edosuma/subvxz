00:20.020 --> 00:21.813
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:21.896 --> 00:26.359
<i>Someone is stalking me.</i>
<i>It transformed and then just shattered.</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:28.945
Do any of these details
mean anything to you?

00:29.029 --> 00:33.408
There was a… a stained-glass window
at my old school in Syosset.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.868
<i>Sapphire.</i>

00:34.951 --> 00:37.454
<i>I have found sapphire</i>
<i>all over the tail fin,</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:39.664
but also all over Ben's hand.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.541
This looks just like Archangel Michael.

00:41.624 --> 00:45.003
This is Maat, Egyptian goddess of justice
in the afterlife.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.713
A metaphorical weighing of souls.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.049
<i>I knew that Eden</i>
<i>would never let me get hurt.</i>

00:49.132 --> 00:51.718
<i>She just proved</i>
<i>that she and I are connected.</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:53.928
I wear my scar on the outside.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.348
Yours is on the inside.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.933
<i>You're a dragon, Cal.</i>

01:32.842 --> 01:33.802
Mm.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.223
You look like hell.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.975
Good morning to you too.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.186
How's the leg?

01:43.269 --> 01:45.063
-Delightful.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.662
Guess you're not seeing
cherry blossoms again, huh?

02:00.745 --> 02:02.247
Mm-mm. Ash,

02:02.872 --> 02:06.042
in keeping
with our apocalyptic-themed anniversary.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.382
I thought saving 191 souls
was overwhelming,

02:12.465 --> 02:17.137
but if the fate of the Lifeboat determines
the fate of billions of people, then…

02:19.055 --> 02:20.140
what do we do?

02:21.224 --> 02:24.102
Easy. Whatever we have to.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.023
I love you, Zeke Landon.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.151
Right back at you, Stone.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.451
How on earth did you get Eden
to eat all those melon slices?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.745
I called them unicorn cookies.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.375
Well, you've got her number.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.128
I'm glad you two are doing so well.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.881
Yeah, me too. All things considered.

02:55.175 --> 02:59.512
Although she did… ask me
to see her mommy today.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.393
Guys, come on.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.354
I can't even clear my throat
without you acting like it's over.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.191
I don't look that bad, do I?

03:12.442 --> 03:14.068
Tough crowd.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.238
-Come on. You want some water?
-No.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.408
Is TJ coming over?

03:20.491 --> 03:22.994
Uh, no, probably not.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.454
Seriously?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.334
Any news on Eagan and the sapphire?

03:30.668 --> 03:32.587
Yeah, Eagan's in the ER,

03:32.670 --> 03:36.174
and, uh, Jared's gonna go see him when
the hospital gives them the green light.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.051
What? Jared's going, not you?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.471
Guys, I'm dying.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.890
But you know who else is?

03:44.682 --> 03:47.435
All of you. You have to keep trying.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.147
There's nothing more important
than being here with you right now.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.733
But what if the sapphire could save me?

03:54.984 --> 03:59.030
Seriously, would you wanna
find that out after I'm gone?

04:01.282 --> 04:03.243
Mom would want us to keep pushing.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.538
Keep fighting.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.670
Then let's find that sapphire.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.054
None of these people know
how little time they have left.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.056
I'm not sure they'd believe it anyway.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.685
The fate of the world lies
in the hands of less than 200 people.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.311
Sorry, what?

04:32.105 --> 04:34.440
There's this new thing they just invented.
It's called sleep.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.733
-You should try it.
-Yeah.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.319
Sleep is for suckers,
especially given the stakes.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.113
Well, that's fair.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.449
Eight billion people.
It's pretty damn stakes-y.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.034
Yeah, well, that's a tomorrow problem.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.620
Today, I'm just trying
to save one life, Cal's.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.872
I thought you said
there was nothing more you could do.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.709
Well, I didn't say
that there was nothing more I could try.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.595
You really are working here now.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.807
Wow! There's that sharp detective work
I keep hearing so much about.

05:07.890 --> 05:11.561
Well, don't get comfortable.
I've gotten you demoted before.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.688
Yeah, and I've knocked
your ass out before.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.606
-There's that.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.984
Detective Vasquez. Welcome aboard.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.111
I already hate it here.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.780
Well, it's a means to an end.

05:23.281 --> 05:26.826
We're more help to the 828ers
inside the belly of the beast.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.996
And this is your cubicle.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.916
I think we can both agree
it is adorably tiny compared to mine.

05:34.000 --> 05:34.834
Mm.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.127
And in the top drawer,

05:36.210 --> 05:39.422
you will find a set of
nonregulation handcuffs as a welcome gift.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.717
Wow. So we've, uh, graduated
to giving each other gifts now?

05:43.468 --> 05:44.302
Does that mean--

05:44.385 --> 05:46.721
They're handcuffs, Vasquez,
not my letterman jacket.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.348
No strings attached, remember?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.478
That is the hospital. Eagan's awake.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.439
Text Michaela. Tell her you'll meet there.
Get that hot ass out the door.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.359
Hurry back. It's day one.
Can't afford to rock the boat.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.531
Staring at the phone
won't make the Eagan news come any sooner.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.116
Uh-huh. Fair enough.

06:07.825 --> 06:11.996
Found this box of family photos.
Put 'em all around Cal when he wakes up.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.374
You're incredible
for setting that area up for him.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.125
That and so many other reasons.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.847
I can still hear her laugh.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.099
Mick.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.976
What idiot downs a double Manhattan,
and then gets in a car and drives?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.813
-Don't do that to yourself. Not today.
-It's unforgivable.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.231
Mick, you gotta forgive yourself.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.242
Um, this is Jared.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.536
-He wants me to meet him at the hospital.
-Okay.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.462
Hey, Dad.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.465
TJ's coming over.
He thinks he may be onto something.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.633
Can we work up here?

07:05.716 --> 07:08.761
Yeah. The more people we have
looking for that sapphire, the better.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.562
Ben.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.650
Grace?

07:36.497 --> 07:37.582
Grace.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.553
I've missed you, my love.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.733
I… I'm broken without you.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.651
No, Ben.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.570
You're strong.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.489
Please help me.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.617
What do I do for our boy?

08:15.244 --> 08:16.329
I'll tell you.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.124
But you need to bring Eden to me.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.254
What?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.132
I need you to bring her to me.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.426
It will all make sense.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.654
How's he doing?

08:51.113 --> 08:52.448
Sleeping peacefully.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.700
How are you doing?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.827
I, uh, just had a Calling.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.080
It was Grace.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.123
Oh my God.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.251
I think she can help with Cal.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.003
How? What did she say?

09:06.087 --> 09:10.341
She wants me to bring Eden to her.
There's only one place I can think of.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.177
Her grave site.
Eden has never been there, right?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.512
No, but…

09:15.513 --> 09:18.558
maybe that's what Eden meant
when she said she wanted to see her mommy.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.103
-Hm.
-But I can't leave him.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.773
I've got Cal,
and I'll be able to tell if he gets worse,

09:25.856 --> 09:27.316
even if he tries to hide it.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.364
-All right. I'll get Eden.
-Okay.

09:43.749 --> 09:47.587
Oh, fun. Time to play bad cop, bad cop.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.338
Well, hey, last time I saw you,

09:49.422 --> 09:52.383
you'd stolen a sacred object
and left us for dead.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.928
So yesterday. Move on, eyebrows.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.223
Do you have any idea
where the Omega Sapphire is?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.892
It was taken from me,

10:01.976 --> 10:06.731
along with a chunk of my scalp,
by the world's smallest sociopath.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.190
Angelina?

10:10.651 --> 10:12.194
How'd she even find out about it?

10:12.778 --> 10:14.280
Hell if I know.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.489
Do you know where she is?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.993
Boiling a rabbit somewhere?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.212
Where'd you get this?

10:31.255 --> 10:34.425
From Nutjob the Elder, Angelina's mom.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.762
I borrowed it from her car.
Check out the first page.

10:37.845 --> 10:42.433
"Behold, I send an angel before thee,
to keep thee in the way,

10:42.516 --> 10:45.853
and bring thee into the place
which I have prepared."

10:45.936 --> 10:47.980
Angelina thinks Eden's her guardian angel.

10:48.064 --> 10:51.859
Look at this guy.
Can almost hear the wheels spinning.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.620
-Yikes. Keep it. It's yours.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.081
Not much of a reader.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.046
Ah, just in time.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.466
Jeter's up to bat.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.099
It's his last game. 2014.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.520
This is next-level bucket listing, man.
Thank you.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.401
I don't think I can keep these down.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.320
For tossing at the TV
when the other team's up.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.615
This is too much.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.616
No!

11:41.534 --> 11:42.576
Now it's too much.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.913
Hey, guys.

11:45.996 --> 11:46.872
Uh…

11:50.000 --> 11:51.377
Cal, I…

11:52.378 --> 11:55.256
What's up, TJ?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.175
If you get hungry from saving the world,

11:59.051 --> 12:00.428
Zeke's catering lunch.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.346
-And dinner.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.933
Y'all have fun.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.108
Okay. Come on, Jeter.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.532
This is it, Eden.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.327
I know you don't remember your real mom,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.205
but I want you to know
how much she loved you.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.836
Please, Grace.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.215
Thank you for bringing her.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.723
Of course.

12:49.018 --> 12:53.481
Ben, I know it's been hard without me.
But I need you to do something.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.775
Anything, name it.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.947
I need you to let Eden
go back to Angelina.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.283
What?

13:04.825 --> 13:06.952
She's the only mother Eden's ever known.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.205
Eden loves her, Ben.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.874
Grace, Angelina murdered you. I'm not--

13:15.002 --> 13:16.086
Your eyes.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.049
What about them?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.885
The color's wrong.
You're not Grace. You're not--

13:23.469 --> 13:25.387
My guardian angel!

13:27.515 --> 13:30.059
Eden! Stay away from her.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.356
Is this what you want?
Show Eden who you really are?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.819
You killed her mother.
You gonna kill her father in front of her?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.612
You can't keep us apart, Ben.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.657
Eden's my angel.
We're supposed to be together.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.367
It's what she wants.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.118
You sure about that?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.455
Given the chance,
are you sure Eden would choose you?

13:52.039 --> 13:53.582
I'd bet my life on it.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.501
Then lower the gun, Angelina.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.837
Let Eden decide.

14:06.095 --> 14:11.267
My love, do you wanna stay with Mommy,
or you wanna be with the bad man?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.185
Oh, Eden.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.770
Hey, come on, Eden.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.147
You know I'm not a bad man.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.816
I'm just a daddy

14:20.150 --> 14:24.238
who loves his little girl
so, so very much.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.453
I love you, Eden. And you love me.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.163
Let her say it.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.836
Eden, who do you wanna be with?

14:45.801 --> 14:46.719
Eden.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.765
-I wanna be with my daddy.

14:51.849 --> 14:52.683
No!

14:55.477 --> 14:56.604
No, Eden.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.398
Don't leave me!

15:00.316 --> 15:01.400
Eden!

15:18.792 --> 15:20.210
Daddy!

15:20.294 --> 15:22.671
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, man. You all right?

15:23.547 --> 15:26.258
Everything's okay.
It's just the two of us,

15:26.342 --> 15:28.928
so we're a bit overprotective
of each other.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.096
Sit down, okay?

15:34.350 --> 15:35.935
Hey, man, what was that all about?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.313
I have no idea. But, uh, it was awful.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.065
-Let's go.
-Hey, yo!

15:41.148 --> 15:43.275
Hey, man, what are you doing?
Where you taking him?

15:43.359 --> 15:45.694
Hey, new guy,
maybe you need to read the handbook

15:45.778 --> 15:49.949
because the minute a passenger exhibits
particularly onerous or unusual behavior,

15:50.032 --> 15:50.950
we detain 'em.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.910
Pretty sure mind-meld scream counts.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.289
-Daddy, what's happening?
-Sit tight. I'll be fine.

15:57.373 --> 16:01.168
It's okay, sweetie.
Just… just stay right here. Okay?

16:01.251 --> 16:02.670
Come on. Let's go.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.090
Calls are pouring in
from all of the regional offices.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.843
What happened to the passengers just now
happened all across the country.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.930
Ah, Dre.
Seriously, I'm worried for all of them.

16:13.013 --> 16:13.973
Yeah.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.853
So Angelina used a sapphire
to send you a fake Calling?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.855
With the one image
she knew I'd do anything for.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.609
I dropped Eden with Dad just in case.
I'm gonna fill Saanvi in.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.949
So if she's got the sapphire,
what chance does the Lifeboat have?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.702
-No, it's sunk.
-Well, not if we find her.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.537
Right? I mean, we can get it back.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.455
We have absolutely no idea where she is.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.916
Be nice if a Calling
could help us out with that.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.711
You know what? I think it might have.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.555
-Where'd that come from?
-Eagan.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.808
I was reading it when we were talking
about Angelina, and I got a Calling.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.519
There was a figure. It had wings, no face.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.354
And it shattered into glass.

17:03.731 --> 17:04.648
How'd you know?

17:06.400 --> 17:09.528
I helped Angelina
with the same exact Calling.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.365
She thought the angel was chasing her,
trying to tell her something.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.367
I know where she is.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.914
-I'm coming with you.
-Zeke, you can barely walk.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.666
What's going on?

17:22.750 --> 17:25.294
I got the 20 on Angelina.
I'm gonna go there now.

17:25.794 --> 17:26.754
Dad?

17:31.633 --> 17:32.926
You have to go with her.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.095
Please.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.889
You have to get the sapphire.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.936
I'll stay here with Cal.
We have a busy day.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.941
All right. Back before you know it, pal.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.698
-Thanks.
-Yep.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.492
All right.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.953
Let's see if what I brought can help Cal.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.372
I can't believe Astoria
let you check this out.

18:02.456 --> 18:06.335
Yeah, once the guy verified I was the one
who sent it from Egypt, he was fine.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.630
I think his name was Levi. You know him?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.716
Uh, kinda. Back to work.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.177
What do you see between these two?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.179
Um…

18:17.262 --> 18:19.681
-They're identical.
-Almost identical.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.225
Okay, eagle eye, school me.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.061
Okay, so in the papyrus,

18:24.144 --> 18:27.189
there's a hole on Maat's chest
where the Omega Sapphire should be.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.524
Yeah, that's not good.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.902
That sapphire may help us
tip Maat's scales of judgment.

18:31.985 --> 18:35.781
It might be the key to saving humanity.

18:37.032 --> 18:38.575
And maybe even Cal.

18:41.161 --> 18:45.874
So the one clue that we needed
from this papyrus is missing. Now what?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.085
Maybe there's something else.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.505
Uh… I… I don't see anything.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.091
What if we're not seeing it
because we can't see it?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.760
Okay. School me.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.513
I learned that the Egyptians
used pigments that were vibrant blue,

18:59.596 --> 19:01.181
but over time, they faded away.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.767
The only way to see them now
would be through an infrared filter.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.311
There might be more to this papyrus,
just hidden from view.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.064
I actually may have something
that could help.

19:14.945 --> 19:15.821
Vance.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.574
Remember when I said I was concerned

19:18.657 --> 19:20.951
about the Omega Sapphire
falling into the wrong hands?

19:21.034 --> 19:21.869
Tell me.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.786
Angelina…

19:24.580 --> 19:26.874
She used it to push a thought
from her head into Ben's.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.959
She created a false Calling?

19:31.295 --> 19:32.838
We didn't see that coming.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.756
No, but we should have.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.010
We've been so focused on using sapphire
to connect to the divine,

19:38.093 --> 19:40.929
we completely forgot about
our connection to each other.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.723
If Angelina has that power,

19:42.806 --> 19:45.517
how will you know if a Calling
is real or false from now on?

19:46.643 --> 19:47.603
We won't.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.439
This is bad.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.732
Well, this is worse.

19:52.608 --> 19:56.028
If misusing the Noah's Ark fragment
created a volcanic fissure…

19:56.904 --> 20:01.325
What consequences will misusing
the Omega Sapphire have on the world?

20:03.577 --> 20:05.662
I'm calling Gupta
because we need the help.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.255
Voilà.

20:16.798 --> 20:20.636
Next stop on the Bucket List Express,
Le Louvre.

20:21.220 --> 20:26.350
I found an amazing virtual tour.
All the masters. No waiting.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.019
We can do something else.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.313
Monopoly?

20:32.064 --> 20:32.898
Like it.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.945
-I haven't played this in ages.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.529
Let's go.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.368
Do you think there might be a way
for you to beat the Death Date?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.577
I don't know.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.506
Hey.

21:00.092 --> 21:04.805
That fear you're feeling,
I can help you and take it all away.

21:06.807 --> 21:10.686
You taking it on and making it go away
are not the same.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.814
Come on. Why else did I come back
with this ability?

21:13.897 --> 21:15.607
Why did I come back older?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.193
I'm sure there's a reason.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.112
Problem is,

21:21.655 --> 21:24.283
I'll never live long enough
to uncover that reason.

21:38.964 --> 21:39.798
Ah.

21:41.049 --> 21:45.012
A DSLR camera with an infrared filter.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.890
Okay, let's see if it still works.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.225
-Ah!

21:50.309 --> 21:53.562
-Giving me very Euro vibes.
-Where'd you even get this?

21:55.272 --> 21:57.357
My mom, actually.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.401
Oh.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.944
She said I had a knack.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.030
Yeah, that was…

22:04.323 --> 22:06.116
that was right before she…

22:10.954 --> 22:12.205
You know what sucks?

22:13.623 --> 22:16.293
How much my mom would've loved your mom.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.340
I can't take any more loss.

22:24.676 --> 22:30.223
You know, just even the thought
of the Death Date, and I can't…

22:32.267 --> 22:34.269
-I can't lose Cal.
-Hey.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.899
Cal's gonna pull through somehow.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.943
We all will. I know it.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.072
For some reason…

22:48.283 --> 22:49.618
when you say that,

22:50.869 --> 22:52.913
it somehow sounds possible.

22:54.247 --> 22:57.167
So thank you for being here.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.878
There's no place I'd rather be.

23:09.012 --> 23:10.597
This is Angelina's old school.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.724
Olive thinks she's here
looking for the angel.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.518
Why are the windows glowing?

23:27.197 --> 23:28.281
Forgive me.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.201
I thought for so long
that you were chasing me.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.954
I now realize you chose me.

23:34.996 --> 23:37.999
You wanted me to realize
I don't need to find an angel.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.377
I <i>am </i>the angel.

23:58.603 --> 23:59.688
Shh.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.120
Angelina, it's over.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.498
It will be. Soon.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.751
For all of you. God has chosen me.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.838
Whatever power you think you have,
you don't.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.632
Are you blind? Look at what I did.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.802
You haven't done anything.
This is your punishment.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.679
The Lord would never punish his angel.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.055
You, an angel?

24:35.182 --> 24:37.058
I'm an archangel

24:37.142 --> 24:42.147
sent to bring vengeance upon the evil
and to lead the righteous to salvation.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.483
No, you're just a person.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.153
A sad, lost,

24:48.904 --> 24:51.698
lonely person in the Lifeboat
awaiting judgment

24:51.781 --> 24:53.074
just like the rest of us!

24:53.158 --> 24:55.202
Read your scripture, Ben!

24:55.285 --> 24:58.997
Since you kept my command
to endure patiently,

24:59.080 --> 25:03.210
I will keep you from the trials that
will test all who dwell on this earth.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.961
You're warping God's words.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.880
Nobody's endured more than me!

25:06.963 --> 25:10.884
No one? No one? His wife is dead!

25:11.760 --> 25:13.053
And so am I.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.515
You did this to me, Michaela.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.849
No, Evie.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.643
No. No, no, no, no.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.520
Mick. It's not her.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.356
There's no one there. It's… it's Angelina.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.108
She's creating this
from things she's heard

25:27.192 --> 25:28.860
or maybe a picture she saw.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.279
I trusted you,

25:32.155 --> 25:33.949
and you killed me.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.586
Vance?

25:50.048 --> 25:52.926
-What is it?
-It's Cal's scar sample. It's glowing.

25:53.843 --> 25:56.346
You said that scar tissue tested negative
across the board.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.766
It did, but something's changed.
I've seen it before.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.103
On Ben's hand. It's sapphire.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.115
See?

26:16.157 --> 26:17.158
Sapphire.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.369
Surrounded by a bunch of dots.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.413
All around the sapphire.

26:21.496 --> 26:22.539
Hold on.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.961
Hmm.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.838
Let's see here.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.759
Sort of a random pattern.

26:38.471 --> 26:39.306
Mm.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.600
Actually…

26:43.643 --> 26:45.437
I don't think it's random at all.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.780
Draco.

26:56.364 --> 26:59.117
Constellation. The Dragon.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.452
It's the same.

27:00.535 --> 27:02.787
You see how the tail,

27:03.455 --> 27:04.914
it touches the scale?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.041
A dragon.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.425
What's up, bud?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.636
Can you see that?

27:18.219 --> 27:20.513
My scar. It's moving.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.102
What the hell?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.396
He was right.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.439
Who?

27:30.357 --> 27:31.191
Henry.

27:31.274 --> 27:34.444
You're a dragon, Cal. Just like me.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.781
I am the Dragon.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.333
Cal?

27:50.251 --> 27:54.631
Did you bring me here?
You pulled me into a Calling? How?

27:54.714 --> 27:59.094
You're destroying any chance we have.
You have to stop this.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.305
I'm doing what I was chosen to do, Cal.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.641
I won't be manipulated by you again.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.653
What happened?

28:16.736 --> 28:18.029
I think she's in a Calling.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.118
-Please help us!

28:23.201 --> 28:24.577
Oh my God.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.340
Get back. Get back!

28:38.925 --> 28:39.968
Yeah? Go.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.140
Stay there. Stay there.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.772
Come on, come on. All right.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.488
Stay back. I'm warning you.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.742
I'm already dying.
There's nothing you can do to me.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.500
-Mom?

29:13.626 --> 29:14.502
How?

29:15.628 --> 29:19.716
It's time to let go now, Cal.
Then we can be together.

29:22.218 --> 29:24.804
Come to me, my sweet, sweet boy.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.233
I missed you so much…

29:39.569 --> 29:40.403
but…

29:42.530 --> 29:44.657
I think there's more I'm supposed to do.

29:45.575 --> 29:46.493
No.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.246
No, you've done so much.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.041
Now it's time to rest.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.001
Come.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.801
I'm ready.

30:02.884 --> 30:03.843
Let go.

30:07.555 --> 30:08.932
<i>Let go.</i>

30:13.895 --> 30:15.814
Cal? Stay with me.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.690
Cal.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.113
Signature, please.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.240
He's all set.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.117
You okay?

30:29.369 --> 30:30.703
I'm so sorry about today.

30:30.787 --> 30:31.871
Thank you.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.123
Ice cream?

30:35.208 --> 30:36.251
Get home safe, guys.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.669
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.878
Hold that thought.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.548
New ball game.

30:42.590 --> 30:43.675
Listen up, folks.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.261
Effective immediately,

30:46.344 --> 30:51.182
we are to detain every passenger
on US soil until further notice.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.433
Wait, what?

30:52.976 --> 30:57.355
No. Wait.
You can't do this. I'm all he's got.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.941
Child protective services
will take care of it.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.860
Daddy! Daddy!

31:01.943 --> 31:04.487
No! Daddy!

31:04.571 --> 31:06.239
I'll be back, okay?

31:10.076 --> 31:12.662
My sweet, sweet boy.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.789
You're so close.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.502
-No need to fight any longer.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.216
Cal?

31:27.969 --> 31:29.220
Cal, what is it?

31:30.471 --> 31:31.764
All those years,

31:33.224 --> 31:34.601
the whole time I was sick,

31:37.061 --> 31:39.606
never once did she tell me
to stop fighting.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.733
Listen to your mother.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.070
-This isn't my mother.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.617
Stay back!

31:50.700 --> 31:52.869
Inside, you're just a scared little boy.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.373
Guilty little weakling
who couldn't save his own mother.

31:58.499 --> 32:01.961
The little boy is gone.
Now you have to deal with me.

32:02.712 --> 32:03.713
No!

32:07.634 --> 32:08.885
No!

32:17.810 --> 32:20.396
Hey, what happened? Cal?
Cal, what happened?

32:22.690 --> 32:24.192
The glow is fading.

32:24.817 --> 32:25.652
Why?

32:25.735 --> 32:26.611
I don't know.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.073
The major was right.
Cal really is the Holy Grail.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.576
What the hell is that?

32:34.744 --> 32:35.787
Vance?

32:38.623 --> 32:40.917
Put your hands in the air! Now!

32:41.000 --> 32:42.210
Destroy everything.

32:52.136 --> 32:52.971
Vance?

32:56.057 --> 32:59.769
Hands where I can see 'em!
Step away from the computer! Now!

33:10.196 --> 33:12.490
Hang in there, bud. Please?

33:14.867 --> 33:16.035
It's time.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.332
-Please get Olive.
-Okay.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.377
Call everyone.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.129
Okay.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.599
<i>We have to figure this out.</i>
<i>It might save Cal.</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:40.435
Okay. Okay, so a sapphire

33:40.518 --> 33:43.563
inside of a dragon
hovering over Maat's scales? Why?

33:43.646 --> 33:45.648
Well,
the scales taught us about the Lifeboat.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.525
That all passengers
are being judged together.

33:48.776 --> 33:52.113
But if a passenger… well, a dragon,

33:52.196 --> 33:55.867
gets touched by the sapphire,
I mean, it could tip the scales,

33:55.950 --> 33:57.952
and all of you could survive,

33:58.036 --> 34:02.623
which means the entire world can survive.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.958
But who's the Dragon?

34:04.042 --> 34:07.795
Cal. Cal can save all of us.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.466
But who can save Cal?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.056
I don't know how
I can ever thank you, Cal.

34:19.057 --> 34:22.185
You saved my life in more ways than one.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.153
Don't go.

34:32.653 --> 34:33.488
Please.

34:34.947 --> 34:38.076
I'll always be here for you,
with you, okay?

34:43.581 --> 34:44.916
<i>You're my best man.</i>

34:46.167 --> 34:47.418
<i>I'll always be with you.</i>

34:55.802 --> 34:59.180
I need fire and police support
to the corner of 82nd and Grant.

35:00.723 --> 35:01.974
Okay. Please hurry.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.893
All right, that's everybody.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.020
There you go.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.523
-I'm going back in for Angelina.
-No, it's way too dangerous.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.192
She won't stop until we stop her.
It's what your Calling wants.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.111
-That's why we're here. Stay with them.
-Ben!

35:13.194 --> 35:14.028
All right.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.282
Hey. I'm right here, okay?
Help's on the way, all right?

35:18.366 --> 35:20.159
-Just gonna check you out.
-Thank you.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.369
It's gonna be okay.

35:23.246 --> 35:25.665
-No!

35:25.748 --> 35:27.166
There has to be something left.

35:30.795 --> 35:31.879
Get away from me!

35:34.465 --> 35:38.886
Angelina, it's over.
The sapphire is shattered. This ends now.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.054
Cal is dying.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.056
I saw him, Ben.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.476
The life is draining from him
while you're here trying to get to me.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.019
Poor Cal.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.020
You're lying!

36:15.923 --> 36:17.550
This is the way it has to be.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.860
Hey, what's going on? Is it Cal?

36:35.943 --> 36:37.486
<i>No. No, it's me.</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:39.780
<i>Uh, can it wait till I get home?</i>

36:41.032 --> 36:42.867
I won't be here when you get home.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.953
Hey, Zeke, you're scaring me.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.788
<i>No, don't be scared.</i>

36:48.372 --> 36:49.373
I'm not…

36:51.792 --> 36:52.960
because of you.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.799
We were always meant to be together, Mick.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.802
Zeke, what's going on?
Why are you telling me this right now?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.680
<i>I was given a second chance at life, Mick.</i>

37:06.390 --> 37:09.769
I didn't know why, but it was you, Mick.

37:10.394 --> 37:11.395
It was you.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.607
And then in the cave,

37:15.900 --> 37:19.237
that magazine photo
of your beautiful face kept me going.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.531
<i>And then when I came back,</i>

37:24.075 --> 37:25.534
<i>I wanted to find you.</i>

37:25.618 --> 37:26.494
<i>I had to.</i>

37:28.454 --> 37:29.914
<i>The first time we touched,</i>

37:30.665 --> 37:35.836
<i>it was like I could feel you</i>
<i>in every cell of my body</i>

37:35.920 --> 37:37.546
<i>like you were a part of me.</i>

37:40.675 --> 37:42.134
<i>You're why I came back.</i>

37:46.013 --> 37:49.976
<i>You're my breath and my blood and my soul.</i>

37:53.271 --> 37:56.399
<i>You let me know</i>
<i>what it means to be truly alive.</i>

38:00.111 --> 38:02.697
The universe brought us together
for a reason, Mick.

38:04.573 --> 38:06.117
It was my second chance

38:07.576 --> 38:11.122
to make up
for all the pain and hurt I caused.

38:13.207 --> 38:14.875
And now I finally get to do that.

38:15.835 --> 38:18.671
Zeke, whatever it is you're gonna do,
you don't have to do it.

38:18.754 --> 38:22.591
Stop. Okay, just wait till I get home.
Just wait… just wait for me, please.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.011
I wish I could.

38:25.678 --> 38:26.929
Zeke, stop. Zeke.

38:27.513 --> 38:28.806
<i>Zeke! Zeke!</i>

38:29.557 --> 38:31.350
-Angelina's gone.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.936
Ben, we gotta go home.
We gotta go home right now.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.741
Why?!

38:48.075 --> 38:51.787
When you lost the Omega Sapphire,
you put the whole world at risk.

38:52.955 --> 38:55.082
I warned you about playing God.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.340
Cal. Come on, buddy.

39:45.299 --> 39:49.136
No. Hey. Come on. Stay with me.
Don't leave me, please. No.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.554
It's okay, my love.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.640
I'll see you again.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.184
Under the stars.

39:55.267 --> 39:57.061
No. No, no.

40:00.648 --> 40:05.444
No! No! No!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

40:31.220 --> 40:35.391
"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst
after righteousness,

40:35.474 --> 40:37.017
for they shall be filled."
