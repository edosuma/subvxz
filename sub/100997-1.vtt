WEBVTT

01:13.090 --> 01:14.290
Stay down!

01:19.529 --> 01:20.930
Get a count of the dead.

01:20.932 --> 01:24.300
No! You sons of bitches!

01:45.522 --> 01:47.424
You havin' those
nightmares again?

01:49.861 --> 01:50.993
Frank.

01:53.064 --> 01:54.531
Frank, you're scaring me.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.431
Hey!

02:04.141 --> 02:05.673
You look awful.

02:05.675 --> 02:07.778
You need to go to town
to see that doctor.

02:13.516 --> 02:15.284
You ain't the only
Civil War veteran

02:15.286 --> 02:17.286
that seen the elephant.

02:17.288 --> 02:19.689
How do you know
anything about it?

02:23.794 --> 02:24.962
Trash.

02:29.333 --> 02:30.968
You wouldn't understand.

02:32.636 --> 02:34.770
I'm not saying I understand,

02:34.772 --> 02:36.841
I'm just telling you,
you need to get some help.

02:39.343 --> 02:40.845
Things I'd done.

02:46.284 --> 02:47.852
Things I've seen.

02:51.621 --> 02:54.058
Ain't no doctor can cure that.

02:57.328 --> 02:58.626
I ain't been to war,

02:58.628 --> 03:01.030
but I've had my fair share
of battles.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.700
Don't belittle me, Frank!

03:06.203 --> 03:07.939
That's all right, darling.

03:09.206 --> 03:11.472
Hey.

03:11.474 --> 03:14.143
It's just a little out
of your depth is all.

03:28.025 --> 03:30.225
Just stop.

03:30.227 --> 03:31.628
Oh, god.

03:42.605 --> 03:44.842
You think you know
what it's like seeing...

03:46.143 --> 03:48.913
someone's head getting
blown up by a cannonball.

03:54.852 --> 03:55.886
Huh?

03:59.056 --> 04:04.093
You ever seen a man
with his scalp torn clean off?

04:04.095 --> 04:05.493
Hm?

04:15.072 --> 04:16.505
Where you goin'?

04:17.673 --> 04:19.707
Gonna take a piss.

04:19.709 --> 04:22.677
Is that all right with you,
or should I call a doctor?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.248
Well, I'm goin' home.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.717
Okay.

04:29.619 --> 04:31.688
Screw you, Frank Connor!

04:47.171 --> 04:48.939
Don't bother callin' on me.

05:26.477 --> 05:28.444
Somebody get me the steward!

05:28.446 --> 05:30.645
We need a stretcher!

05:30.647 --> 05:32.647
- Hudsons, you go ahead!
- Hey! Hey, Jake!

05:32.649 --> 05:34.083
Jake, listen to me.
Listen to me.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.751
You're gonna
be all right, okay?

05:35.753 --> 05:37.119
Think about your kids.

05:37.121 --> 05:39.488
You think about Betsy and your
kids back home, all right?

05:39.490 --> 05:40.889
Tell my family
I said I love them.

05:40.891 --> 05:43.092
No, no, no. Hey, listen.

05:43.094 --> 05:44.226
Listen to me.
You're gonna tell them.

05:44.228 --> 05:45.994
We're gonna go back, I'm gonna
bring you back before...

05:45.996 --> 05:47.563
- Just tell them I love them.
- And you're gonna

05:47.565 --> 05:48.831
- tell them yourself.
- Tell them I...

05:48.833 --> 05:51.166
- No! Jake!
- All right, men!

05:51.168 --> 05:53.368
Jake, no! No!

05:53.370 --> 05:56.305
You sons of bitches!

06:01.112 --> 06:02.610
Come get it!

06:02.612 --> 06:04.714
I'll kill you all!

06:32.776 --> 06:35.777
Hmm?

06:35.779 --> 06:37.980
God, I thought you went away!

06:37.982 --> 06:39.682
It's time, Mr. Frank.

06:42.953 --> 06:46.056
- Who is it?
- It's me, Sa'ani.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.031
Yeah.

06:58.369 --> 07:00.104
Yeah, you're right on time.

07:12.316 --> 07:14.216
Where to
tonight, Mr. Frank?

07:14.218 --> 07:17.586
Ranch in Three Rivers,
just south of the town.

07:17.588 --> 07:19.056
It not safe there.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.290
Yeah.

07:35.806 --> 07:37.239
All right.

07:37.241 --> 07:39.977
Fifteen minutes, meet me
right back here.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.146
Yes, Mr. Frank.

08:07.171 --> 08:10.874
Goddamn stupid bastard,
there's dynamite in there!

08:11.775 --> 08:13.777
Go on, get the rest
of those boxes.

08:15.379 --> 08:16.447
Jackass.

08:54.485 --> 08:55.486
Chet.

08:57.221 --> 08:58.222
Chet?

09:00.724 --> 09:02.159
Where are ya?

09:02.860 --> 09:04.361
Is he there?

09:37.828 --> 09:42.166
You goddamn jackass,
you messed up here.

09:45.269 --> 09:48.539
What the hell
is this jackass doing?

09:57.614 --> 09:59.016
Are you Walsh?

10:06.490 --> 10:08.523
What the hell do you want?

10:08.525 --> 10:09.993
Artemis Walsh.

10:12.162 --> 10:14.231
Who the fuck are you?

10:14.932 --> 10:16.766
Are you Walsh or not?

10:16.768 --> 10:18.768
Well, that may be for me to know

10:18.770 --> 10:20.537
and you to find out now,
ain't it?

10:22.306 --> 10:25.376
You've been stealing from
the wrong people, Mr. Walsh.

11:04.615 --> 11:08.517
Wyatt, Chet, get in here!

11:24.769 --> 11:25.969
Wyatt!

11:28.205 --> 11:29.206
Nope.

11:31.241 --> 11:34.009
Why don't you just
turn your ass around

11:34.011 --> 11:36.311
and get the fuck out of here?

11:36.313 --> 11:38.649
We can do this in here,
or go outside.

11:39.550 --> 11:40.951
Your choice.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.311
Come on, Walsh.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.382
Die like a pig in here,
or like a man outside.

12:28.766 --> 12:30.033
It's time.

13:40.203 --> 13:41.839
Good business, Mr. Frank?

13:44.107 --> 13:45.309
Yep.

13:46.209 --> 13:47.611
Let's get out of here.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.402
All right, come on.

15:59.376 --> 16:00.812
There's nobody in there.

16:43.587 --> 16:47.424
Frank, he's a boy, damn it!

16:52.295 --> 16:53.763
On your feet, come on.

16:53.765 --> 16:55.898
Let's go.
Come on, soldier. Time to go.

16:55.900 --> 16:57.099
- Let's go. Come on.
- Nothing left

16:57.101 --> 16:59.235
- to see here, it's all over.
- Come on, soldier!

16:59.237 --> 17:00.568
- Get up!
- Leave him!

17:00.570 --> 17:02.303
- We gotta go!
- Let's go!

17:02.305 --> 17:04.473
- Come on, soldier.
- Hey, there. We gotta go.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.710
Watch your back!

17:07.444 --> 17:09.046
Get down the road.

19:33.690 --> 19:35.458
"Bureau of Indian affairs."

19:38.963 --> 19:40.932
"Second Texas Rifle."

19:44.035 --> 19:46.203
Frank Connor.

19:47.905 --> 19:49.506
Knows me too well.

19:52.575 --> 19:55.077
You didn't think you two
could actually get away?

19:59.216 --> 20:00.918
My safe!

20:02.920 --> 20:04.186
Violet.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.394
Vi, who opened my safe?

20:12.396 --> 20:17.132
Sir, I don't know.
I didn't open it.

20:17.134 --> 20:18.934
- You didn't open it?
- No, sir.

20:18.936 --> 20:20.836
Did the children
open my safe, Violet?

20:20.838 --> 20:24.239
No. I mean, I don't think so.

20:24.241 --> 20:26.141
I don't watch them all day long.

20:29.479 --> 20:33.082
You got one job,
to watch my kids.

20:33.084 --> 20:36.653
And not only are they gone,
those little varmints robbed me!

21:31.909 --> 21:34.045
Mr. Connor,
are you there?

21:36.781 --> 21:39.081
Mr. Connor!

21:39.083 --> 21:41.285
Mr. Connor?

21:47.058 --> 21:48.292
Hello?

21:49.626 --> 21:51.929
Please, sir!
We need to talk with you.

21:57.802 --> 21:59.468
Mr. Connor,
are you there?

21:59.470 --> 22:00.838
Mr. Connor?

22:05.242 --> 22:07.009
Mr. Connor, are you there?

22:07.011 --> 22:09.445
Mr. Connor?

22:09.447 --> 22:11.082
We need your help, sir!

22:20.091 --> 22:22.091
- Come here. Get in here.
- Ow!

22:22.093 --> 22:22.958
Quick.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.625
- Hey, watch it!
- Come on, stop!

22:28.799 --> 22:31.599
Who the hell are ya?
Start talking, now.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.104
Look what you've done!

22:33.938 --> 22:35.940
I said who the hell are you?

22:42.645 --> 22:44.113
Ow.

22:44.115 --> 22:45.581
We'll find another way.

22:45.583 --> 22:47.416
Come here, come here.

22:47.418 --> 22:49.019
Hey, watch it!

22:51.489 --> 22:53.555
- Sit.
- Ugh!

22:58.429 --> 22:59.997
Now, let's try this again.

23:05.735 --> 23:09.271
I said who are you,

23:09.273 --> 23:11.041
and what the hell
are you doing here?

23:18.015 --> 23:20.115
- I said who the hell are you?
- Okay!

23:20.117 --> 23:22.650
Okay, we'll explain.
Just please don't hurt us.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.052
Please don't hurt us.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.588
Please, you're the only one
that can help us.

23:26.590 --> 23:29.858
Who are you?

23:29.860 --> 23:31.894
Grace, and this is my
little brother, Ethan.

23:31.896 --> 23:33.629
Okay, well, that's progress.

23:33.631 --> 23:35.933
Grace, Ethan, what are
you doing out here?

23:37.434 --> 23:39.734
Well, we took a horse.

23:39.736 --> 23:41.172
Where's your parents?

23:42.273 --> 23:44.540
It's got a lot to do
with our parents.

23:44.542 --> 23:45.910
You don't say.

23:47.845 --> 23:50.512
Well, it all started
when our momma got married

23:50.514 --> 23:51.782
five years ago.

23:53.317 --> 23:54.351
Where's your daddy?

23:56.320 --> 23:57.321
He died.

23:58.756 --> 24:01.056
- Sorry to hear that.
- He was a soldier.

24:01.058 --> 24:03.794
He was killed
in the Simpsonville Massacre.

24:10.034 --> 24:12.401
Our momma said he was a hero,

24:12.403 --> 24:15.372
that he sacrificed himself
to save five men.

24:17.608 --> 24:19.775
Sounds like a great man.

24:19.777 --> 24:22.344
Grace says
that she remembers him,

24:22.346 --> 24:24.112
but I think she's lying.

24:24.114 --> 24:25.514
- I do remember him!
- Sure.

24:25.516 --> 24:28.050
Hey, cut it out,
you two. I don't really care.

24:28.052 --> 24:31.255
You best spit it out
or get to the goddarn point.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.289
So, like I was saying,

24:34.291 --> 24:36.792
our momma got remarried
five years ago.

24:36.794 --> 24:39.161
But, at first, we liked
our stepdaddy,

24:39.163 --> 24:41.196
but soon,
after they got married,

24:41.198 --> 24:43.398
he started treating
us all real bad.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.833
Yeah, real bad.

24:44.835 --> 24:46.835
Our momma's been
doing everything she can

24:46.837 --> 24:48.670
to hold things together.

24:48.672 --> 24:51.406
You know, for us.

24:51.408 --> 24:55.246
And then, last week,
our parents went out of town.

24:58.082 --> 25:00.749
<i>We went out
on a school outing,</i>

25:00.751 --> 25:02.519
<i>but then, out of nowhere...</i>

25:04.722 --> 25:06.257
<i>we saw our stepfather.</i>

25:07.658 --> 25:09.458
- <i>So?</i>
- <i>So?</i>

25:09.460 --> 25:11.593
<i>So they were supposed
to be in Dallas together</i>

25:11.595 --> 25:13.662
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

25:13.664 --> 25:17.799
<i>And we hadn't heard
from our mom for a week.</i>

25:17.801 --> 25:19.370
<i>She would never do that.</i>

25:24.708 --> 25:28.577
Well, I tell you something,
I feel so bad for both of y'all.

25:28.579 --> 25:30.679
I do. You're just tugging
at my heartstrings.

25:30.681 --> 25:34.383
But why don't you tell me what
this has to do with me, huh?

25:34.385 --> 25:36.885
Our stepfather locked
a safe in his house,

25:36.887 --> 25:39.288
but he don't know we
stole his combination.

25:39.290 --> 25:41.523
And Grace found
some papers inside.

25:41.525 --> 25:44.295
- And with a little research...
- We found you.

26:00.644 --> 26:02.046
Come on.

26:15.259 --> 26:16.560
There.

26:58.803 --> 27:00.302
Where the hell they'd go?

27:00.304 --> 27:02.537
There ain't
nowhere to hide.

27:02.539 --> 27:03.972
They couldn't have gone far.

27:03.974 --> 27:06.410
Let's check those outbuildings
we saw coming in.

27:08.045 --> 27:09.478
Let's get moving.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.449
Ain't nobody around for miles,
they couldn't have gone far.

27:14.151 --> 27:15.852
Back up there
to the right.

27:15.854 --> 27:18.420
- Come on, come on.
- Let's go!

27:18.422 --> 27:20.589
- Do a once around.
- All right.

27:29.166 --> 27:30.234
Hyah!

27:33.604 --> 27:35.005
I'll circle around.

27:35.774 --> 27:37.107
Watch my back.

27:38.877 --> 27:40.511
You see anything?

27:50.220 --> 27:53.624
- Nothing.
- Let's go check them out.

27:56.895 --> 27:58.660
Where is he?

27:58.662 --> 28:00.230
They couldn't have gone far.

28:10.073 --> 28:11.575
Let's check the shack.

28:30.762 --> 28:32.563
Come on.

28:35.399 --> 28:37.201
Where the hell
are those kids?

28:39.002 --> 28:40.535
There ain't
nobody here.

28:40.537 --> 28:41.638
Hey!

28:42.473 --> 28:43.672
I don't see nothing.

28:43.674 --> 28:46.508
Briggs ain't gonna believe they
just vanished into thin air.

28:46.510 --> 28:49.411
That don't matter, 'cause we
ain't gonna tell him that.

28:49.413 --> 28:54.716
- What do you want to tell him?
- We can say he wasn't here.

28:54.718 --> 28:57.554
Ain't no way I'm telling Briggs
we had a busted flush.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.423
Right?

29:00.624 --> 29:01.658
Right.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.794
Well, let's get back to town.

29:04.796 --> 29:06.061
Maybe we'll see
Connor there anyway.

29:26.885 --> 29:30.619
All right. Now it's my turn.

29:30.621 --> 29:32.790
What kind of information
led you to me?

29:34.057 --> 29:36.525
Well, you were on a list.

29:36.527 --> 29:38.193
What kind of list?

29:38.195 --> 29:39.663
It had all these names,

29:40.664 --> 29:42.466
and then... and they had yours.

29:44.201 --> 29:47.669
And it had
your birthday, your location,

29:47.671 --> 29:48.773
a drawing of you.

29:49.573 --> 29:51.275
And even your shoe size.

29:57.782 --> 29:59.149
Is that so?

30:02.719 --> 30:03.585
Why y'all come to me?

30:03.587 --> 30:05.353
Why didn't you go
to the marshals?

30:05.355 --> 30:08.490
Because our stepfather
works for the government.

30:08.492 --> 30:11.961
Yeah, he's a federal agent
working for Congress.

30:11.963 --> 30:13.328
With the war department?

30:13.330 --> 30:16.231
No, I think he's something
more high level.

30:16.233 --> 30:18.099
With the Bureau
of Indian Affairs?

30:18.101 --> 30:19.769
Yeah, yeah.

30:19.771 --> 30:21.171
Let me ask you something.

30:22.272 --> 30:24.809
How do I know you two
ain't lying to me, huh?

30:37.421 --> 30:40.188
There's a lot
of names on this list.

30:40.190 --> 30:42.223
Yeah, and if you look
to the right,

30:42.225 --> 30:44.726
it's very important.

30:44.728 --> 30:46.494
It says...

30:46.496 --> 30:49.197
- "Eradicate."
- I looked it up.

30:49.199 --> 30:52.233
Eradicate means "pull it up
by the roots."

30:52.235 --> 30:55.470
Or "do away completely
as if pulled by the roots."

30:55.472 --> 30:57.174
Yeah, I know
what it means.

31:02.646 --> 31:04.648
Think they'll
leave us alone now?

31:06.050 --> 31:07.785
No, I don't suspect they will.

31:10.187 --> 31:12.054
I expect they'll be back
before long.

31:14.358 --> 31:15.726
Where are we gonna go?

31:16.794 --> 31:17.795
"We"?

31:20.564 --> 31:22.631
Well, I expect
that you two dummies

31:22.633 --> 31:25.402
would just die if I sent you
back out on the prairie.

31:31.776 --> 31:32.777
All right.

31:34.277 --> 31:35.343
I'm gonna go back to the cabin

31:35.345 --> 31:37.414
and get us some supplies
and figure all this out.

31:43.253 --> 31:44.554
Stay quiet.

31:46.590 --> 31:48.024
Okay?

32:16.087 --> 32:18.586
It's okay.

32:57.128 --> 32:58.794
Mr. Briggs.

32:58.796 --> 33:00.996
Don't call me
that, Mr. Danziger.

33:00.998 --> 33:02.297
Appreciate you
making your way back

33:02.299 --> 33:04.066
to the Compound after supper.

33:04.068 --> 33:05.233
I don't like to miss dessert,

33:05.235 --> 33:06.301
you know it's the best part
of the meal,

33:06.303 --> 33:07.839
and she was pretty too.

33:08.672 --> 33:10.206
How many times I gotta tell ya?

33:10.208 --> 33:11.740
Don't salute me!

33:11.742 --> 33:13.243
This ain't the military!

33:19.751 --> 33:21.117
- Not now.
- Who's got

33:21.119 --> 33:23.119
the wagon set up?
Where's his stuff?

33:23.121 --> 33:24.220
You should do a check.

33:24.222 --> 33:25.653
I'll go on out
and I'll be right back,

33:25.655 --> 33:27.255
and we'll make sure
it's written.

33:27.257 --> 33:28.623
Okay,
I'll be right back.

33:28.625 --> 33:29.759
Take the paper with you.

33:29.761 --> 33:31.561
And read it.

33:33.530 --> 33:35.632
Okay,
I'll be right back.

33:36.968 --> 33:39.068
Get it all done
before the boss sees it.

33:53.851 --> 33:57.387
Say, Danziger, you don't have
a, uh, a light, do you?

34:02.827 --> 34:04.327
With all due respect,

34:05.897 --> 34:07.932
there's gunpowder
residue everywhere.

34:09.733 --> 34:12.069
Whole building could blow
if you drop that cigar.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.271
You don't think
I'd be stupid enough

34:15.273 --> 34:17.440
to blow up my own
infantry, do you?

34:23.713 --> 34:28.052
Could you imagine if somebody
told Ulysses S. Grant

34:29.085 --> 34:30.888
that he couldn't smoke a cigar

34:32.255 --> 34:33.556
in the White House?

34:34.690 --> 34:36.225
No, sir.

34:44.701 --> 34:45.837
So...

34:47.571 --> 34:49.406
You wanna talk about something?

34:50.340 --> 34:51.907
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do.

34:51.909 --> 34:55.677
Uh, well, first of all,
let me just say...

34:55.679 --> 34:58.082
Ah, cut the ceremony,
this ain't the army.

34:59.317 --> 35:00.852
You can speak freely.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.688
In fact, why don't
you take a seat?

35:05.522 --> 35:08.491
Yes, sir.

35:11.628 --> 35:13.929
Go get them horses
from the water!

35:13.931 --> 35:16.198
Sir, Washington D.C.
is beginning to question

35:16.200 --> 35:17.467
some of our activities.

35:19.103 --> 35:21.036
Oh?

35:21.038 --> 35:23.239
They've already
contacted captains

35:23.241 --> 35:25.207
in three of our
operating arenas,

35:25.209 --> 35:26.876
and just last week,

35:26.878 --> 35:28.911
an agent from
the Bureau of Indian Affairs

35:28.913 --> 35:32.147
contacted me directly
and had some very...

35:33.550 --> 35:36.620
...specific questions
about our procedures.

35:37.021 --> 35:38.022
Uh-oh.

35:43.526 --> 35:44.760
They seem to believe

35:44.762 --> 35:48.197
that we are selling weapons
to the Natives,

35:48.199 --> 35:50.801
when, of course, we ought
to be selling to the settlers.

35:52.535 --> 35:55.505
And if I may continue
to speak freely sir...

35:56.240 --> 35:57.507
Go on, Robert.

36:01.178 --> 36:04.081
Sir, I think maybe this
operation ain't under the law.

36:04.514 --> 36:05.783
And, uh...

36:06.884 --> 36:09.787
I got a family to tend to,
and, well...

36:11.789 --> 36:14.491
I feel I've done
some good time here and,

36:15.326 --> 36:16.591
with your permission, of course,

36:16.593 --> 36:19.163
I'd like to get
while the gettin's good.

36:20.430 --> 36:22.264
Say no more.

36:22.266 --> 36:24.068
You have a family to tend to.

36:25.303 --> 36:26.670
Yes, sir.

36:41.118 --> 36:42.119
Well...

36:45.555 --> 36:46.857
I suppose...

36:48.625 --> 36:50.593
if you can't ethically
and morally

36:51.996 --> 36:54.096
commit yourself with a hundred
percent of your being

36:54.098 --> 36:55.132
to this arrangement,

36:57.534 --> 36:59.134
then I have no choice
but to release you

36:59.136 --> 37:00.570
from your responsibilities.

37:04.842 --> 37:05.843
Sir.

37:09.780 --> 37:11.816
Well, sir,
that is, uh...

37:13.516 --> 37:16.051
Thank you, sir, I...
I do appreciate it.

37:16.053 --> 37:20.488
And my wife and children
will surely appreciate it too.

37:27.264 --> 37:29.967
There's one thing you
should know though, Danziger.

37:31.369 --> 37:33.102
You should know
there's only one way

37:33.104 --> 37:34.637
to leave my operation.

37:35.773 --> 37:37.306
Sir...

37:40.244 --> 37:41.709
Please, please.

37:41.711 --> 37:43.080
You are dismissed.

37:50.354 --> 37:51.956
Lousy bootlicker.

37:54.624 --> 37:55.791
Hey, Briggs.

37:55.793 --> 37:58.093
Feldman and Kennedy
are on the wire.

37:58.095 --> 38:00.462
We're just
finishing up here.

38:04.935 --> 38:05.936
What we got?

38:07.371 --> 38:08.973
Connor is not home.

38:09.974 --> 38:11.108
We'll find them.

38:14.278 --> 38:15.745
He just slipped his hovels.

38:19.682 --> 38:21.517
"No, sir, we'll find him.

38:21.519 --> 38:23.020
He just slipped his hovels."

38:24.488 --> 38:26.321
What about the kids?

38:29.726 --> 38:31.162
Kids, question mark.

38:33.030 --> 38:34.065
Uh...

38:35.533 --> 38:37.001
They were not there either.

38:39.136 --> 38:40.568
"Kids not there."

38:40.570 --> 38:42.037
Don't stop looking for 'em,

38:42.039 --> 38:43.806
and when you find them,
you hold them,

38:43.808 --> 38:45.974
and you let me know immediately.

38:45.976 --> 38:48.678
"Keep looking."

38:50.081 --> 38:52.216
"Hold them.

38:55.319 --> 38:56.651
Be quick."

38:56.653 --> 38:59.090
He got away,
we'll find them soon though.

39:00.057 --> 39:01.056
Period.

39:01.058 --> 39:04.659
- "We'll find soon."
- I don't have soon, Feldman.

39:14.505 --> 39:15.703
Feldman.

39:15.705 --> 39:20.277
Do what you have to do

39:21.512 --> 39:24.014
to bring my kids home.

39:26.350 --> 39:32.622
"Find those kids...

39:34.425 --> 39:35.625
now."

39:38.596 --> 39:41.098
That's it. Let's just
pack that up and go.

39:42.466 --> 39:44.101
Ay-yay-yay.

39:46.937 --> 39:47.938
Damn.

40:00.484 --> 40:02.717
What?

40:02.719 --> 40:05.487
Your mother's somewhere
between here and El Paso

40:05.489 --> 40:07.422
but you don't know where, huh?

40:07.424 --> 40:10.092
Yes. Well, we figured
you'd know where she is.

40:10.094 --> 40:12.660
Yeah? What makes
you figure that?

40:12.662 --> 40:14.096
We know all about you.

40:14.098 --> 40:16.867
You're a part of the
Second Texas Mounted Rifles.

40:18.369 --> 40:20.302
Hey, look, Mr. Connor,
we know you're living

40:20.304 --> 40:21.637
out in the boonies,

40:21.639 --> 40:25.374
but you're a real hero
in the war.

40:25.376 --> 40:28.312
- I weren't no hero.
- Sure, you were.

40:29.847 --> 40:31.882
There are no heroes
anymore, kid.

40:35.486 --> 40:39.988
But you saved lives, and you,
you helped people.

40:39.990 --> 40:41.957
No, I watched men,
women, and children

40:41.959 --> 40:43.691
die right in front of my face,

40:43.693 --> 40:45.093
and there was nothing
I can do about it

40:45.095 --> 40:47.196
ninety-nine percent of the time.

40:47.198 --> 40:48.465
That ain't no hero.

40:53.571 --> 40:54.939
Is he okay?

40:57.041 --> 40:59.274
What makes you think
I can find your mother?

40:59.276 --> 41:00.776
Because you've got to!

41:08.452 --> 41:09.952
What's your mother's name?

41:09.954 --> 41:11.987
- Heather.
- Heather.

41:11.989 --> 41:13.255
Heather.

41:13.257 --> 41:14.722
Heather what?

41:14.724 --> 41:16.425
Heather Powell.

41:20.497 --> 41:22.032
You do know her.

41:25.102 --> 41:28.103
Mr. Connor, how do
you know our mother?

41:28.105 --> 41:29.737
Mr. Connor!

41:29.739 --> 41:31.006
Wait, Mr. Connor!

41:31.008 --> 41:33.077
Where are you going?
Wait for us!

41:35.579 --> 41:36.912
What's going on?

41:51.161 --> 41:53.297
Is this some kind of joke, huh?

41:54.031 --> 41:54.963
No, sir.

41:54.965 --> 41:56.098
You tell me the truth.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.936
How'd you know where
to find me, huh?

42:00.104 --> 42:02.304
Y'all two ain't been
honest with me!

42:04.008 --> 42:05.976
How do you know who I am!

42:12.783 --> 42:14.449
Hey, what!

42:23.560 --> 42:25.195
He gave this to our mom.

42:29.199 --> 42:31.500
You were the only Frank
on our stepdaddy's list,

42:31.502 --> 42:35.506
and we figured it was you,
and we were right.

42:48.919 --> 42:50.787
Now you tell us,

42:50.789 --> 42:52.323
how do you know our mother?

42:59.463 --> 43:01.065
Please, Mr. Connor.

43:06.470 --> 43:07.538
Your...

43:09.139 --> 43:12.376
Your mother was the only one
that I ever truly loved.

43:14.111 --> 43:19.883
And we were together for
a very short while, but, uh...

43:24.188 --> 43:25.222
But what?

43:30.327 --> 43:32.529
It didn't work out.

43:33.697 --> 43:35.065
Why?

43:47.177 --> 43:48.276
You're too young to be asking

43:48.278 --> 43:49.947
those kind of questions,
all right?

43:56.821 --> 43:58.222
Why didn't it work out?

44:00.324 --> 44:01.890
'Cause I wasn't good enough
for her!

44:01.892 --> 44:03.291
'Cause I was a horse's ass.

44:03.293 --> 44:06.061
Because I, I just,
I couldn't handle real life

44:06.063 --> 44:08.265
when I got home
from those bloody battles.

44:10.901 --> 44:13.034
What happened?

44:13.036 --> 44:15.439
Just stay the hell away from me!

44:31.488 --> 44:32.956
Here they come!

45:25.976 --> 45:27.644
Where is the little lady?

45:30.782 --> 45:32.216
The safe.

45:36.220 --> 45:37.254
Well...

45:39.523 --> 45:41.723
Bring her out.

45:41.725 --> 45:42.760
I'll get her for you.

45:57.942 --> 46:00.175
I don't want to see him,
tell him to go away.

46:00.177 --> 46:02.077
Just hobble your lip
and come on.

46:02.079 --> 46:03.580
I refuse.

46:26.737 --> 46:29.473
What the hell is wrong
with you, Travis?

46:30.875 --> 46:32.543
How are you, sweetheart?

46:34.244 --> 46:35.811
Are my men taking
good care of you?

46:35.813 --> 46:37.782
Oh, do not trifle with me!

46:39.049 --> 46:40.517
What is going on?

46:47.859 --> 46:49.159
Heather.

46:50.627 --> 46:51.829
You need to settle down.

46:54.264 --> 46:55.767
Everything is A-okay.

46:58.068 --> 46:59.269
You.

46:59.837 --> 47:01.069
You...

47:01.071 --> 47:02.737
You are a madman!

47:02.739 --> 47:04.006
Where are my children?

47:04.008 --> 47:05.473
Where are they?

47:05.475 --> 47:06.610
Where are they?

47:08.111 --> 47:09.377
Where are my children?

47:09.379 --> 47:10.848
They're fine, Heather.

47:12.316 --> 47:18.453
Although, Grace did get a B
on a spelling test

47:18.455 --> 47:19.654
for which she was punished.

47:19.656 --> 47:21.389
We are an A family,
as you know.

47:21.391 --> 47:24.794
And Ethan tends to be quite
the crybaby,

47:24.796 --> 47:26.697
but we had a little talk.

47:28.665 --> 47:32.770
If you hurt them,
I swear to God...

47:34.304 --> 47:35.470
I swear to God...

47:35.472 --> 47:39.276
Now, why would I hurt
my children, Heather?

47:41.111 --> 47:42.713
They are my children.

47:45.349 --> 47:47.083
That's not what she said
when we married.

47:56.226 --> 47:57.527
Travis...

47:58.830 --> 48:01.663
Please, I... I don't know...

48:01.665 --> 48:04.301
I don't know what
you're up to here, I don't care.

48:05.602 --> 48:10.338
But if you just, please,
let me go home to the children.

48:10.340 --> 48:11.841
I... I swear you...

48:11.843 --> 48:13.174
You'll never have
to hear from me again,

48:13.176 --> 48:15.210
I will go away forever.

48:15.212 --> 48:16.480
- Please.
- "Forever"?

48:20.283 --> 48:25.222
Unfortunately,
it's not that simple.

48:27.157 --> 48:28.358
You see...

48:30.193 --> 48:32.162
You have more value...

48:34.132 --> 48:35.730
to my mission.

48:42.774 --> 48:44.241
Your mission?

48:47.912 --> 48:49.680
Am I ransom?

48:50.380 --> 48:52.081
Uh, is that what I am?

48:52.083 --> 48:53.617
Is that all I am to you?

48:57.055 --> 48:58.255
I mean...

48:58.923 --> 49:00.790
I... I knew...

49:00.792 --> 49:02.290
I knew it. I...

49:02.292 --> 49:03.725
There was always something.

49:03.727 --> 49:07.965
There was always something
wrong about you, about us.

49:13.603 --> 49:14.705
Uh-oh.

49:15.739 --> 49:19.309
Well, I'm afraid
that might be my cue.

49:21.045 --> 49:22.312
Well...

49:23.313 --> 49:24.715
Little angel.

49:27.217 --> 49:28.953
I'll be back to check
on you later.

49:31.221 --> 49:32.589
Oh.

49:33.891 --> 49:35.292
I almost forgot.

49:36.861 --> 49:42.765
I bought you some of
those revealin' petticoats

49:42.767 --> 49:43.698
that you like so much.

49:43.700 --> 49:45.734
Why don't you go back
inside, and...

49:45.736 --> 49:47.839
change into something
a little more comfortable?

49:49.173 --> 49:50.640
I'm sure my boys
would enjoy that.

49:51.742 --> 49:54.844
You son of a bitch!

50:02.686 --> 50:06.387
Kickin' ain't gonna
get you nowhere,

50:06.389 --> 50:07.792
unless you're a mule.

50:12.130 --> 50:13.798
Remember that, sweetheart.

50:16.033 --> 50:17.434
Get off me!

50:19.569 --> 50:21.605
Stay the hell away from me!

50:23.808 --> 50:27.642
Stay away from me!

50:27.644 --> 50:28.510
Get off me!

50:28.512 --> 50:30.411
- Let's go, boys.
- Get off me!

50:30.413 --> 50:31.881
We've got a fighter.

50:31.883 --> 50:34.984
Get off me! Get off me!

51:13.858 --> 51:16.726
This is good.
We can stop there.

51:24.434 --> 51:26.670
Get on down, come on.

51:38.682 --> 51:39.547
Hey.

51:39.549 --> 51:41.518
Thought you
should eat something.

51:45.223 --> 51:46.523
Thank you.

52:18.055 --> 52:22.024
We'll sleep here tonight,
continue on in the morning.

52:22.026 --> 52:25.060
Mr. Connor, where
are you taking us?

52:25.062 --> 52:25.928
A friend of mine.

52:25.930 --> 52:27.899
I'm gonna make sure
you're both taken care of.

52:29.666 --> 52:31.499
But we wanna stay with you.

52:31.501 --> 52:33.503
You ain't staying
with me, nah-uh.

52:34.772 --> 52:36.537
A friend of mine is gonna
make sure you're safe

52:36.539 --> 52:38.708
until I can figure out
what's going on.

52:39.476 --> 52:41.176
But, Mr. Connor,
we can't just...

52:41.178 --> 52:43.212
Don't question my decision.

52:43.214 --> 52:44.113
Otherwise,
I'll leave you out here

52:44.115 --> 52:46.148
in the middle of a desert
to fend for yourselves,

52:46.150 --> 52:47.184
you got it?

52:55.993 --> 52:58.595
Finish your eatin'
and get some sleep.

54:27.985 --> 54:29.251
Come on.

54:29.253 --> 54:31.686
You two sleep a lot.

54:31.688 --> 54:34.189
Momma said kids have
to get a lot of sleep

54:34.191 --> 54:36.058
to grow big and strong.

54:36.060 --> 54:38.129
Well, then you two
growin' to giants.

54:39.562 --> 54:40.963
Come on.

54:40.965 --> 54:42.199
Gotta get going.

54:45.702 --> 54:48.504
Come on, lazy slug. Get up.

55:03.387 --> 55:05.790
Well, I'm up.

55:21.772 --> 55:23.472
Come on, come on!

55:35.652 --> 55:38.253
What do y'all want?
I didn't do nothing!

55:38.255 --> 55:40.224
What are you chasing me for?

55:41.192 --> 55:43.158
Come on, come on.

55:45.863 --> 55:46.995
All right, all right.

55:46.997 --> 55:48.864
I'm here, what do you want?

55:48.866 --> 55:50.901
I didn't do nothin'!

55:51.802 --> 55:54.038
Come on, boys.
What's this about?

55:58.809 --> 56:00.643
Tell me what y'all want!

56:10.387 --> 56:12.988
You boys got a problem?

56:12.990 --> 56:15.656
All right, all right, game over.
What do you want?

56:15.658 --> 56:17.960
Tell us where Frank Connor is.

56:17.962 --> 56:20.062
You couldn't just ask me that
without all the scare tactics?

56:20.064 --> 56:22.663
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

56:22.665 --> 56:24.900
Where have you been hanging out
with Frank Connor?

56:24.902 --> 56:25.968
I don't know where he is.

56:25.970 --> 56:27.903
I left him a week ago,
I ain't seen him since.

56:27.905 --> 56:29.805
You're lying, you're getting
off that horse right now.

56:29.807 --> 56:31.073
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes, you are.

56:31.075 --> 56:32.541
- No, no!
- Get off that horse. Get off!

56:32.543 --> 56:34.276
- No, no, no, no!
- Get down here!

56:34.278 --> 56:36.478
Do yourself a favor
and tell us where Frank is.

56:36.480 --> 56:39.014
Look, I'm telling you the truth,
I don't know where he is.

56:39.016 --> 56:40.816
I don't know, I promise!

56:40.818 --> 56:43.085
- I don't know where he is.
- Tell us. Where is he?

56:43.087 --> 56:45.154
- I don't know!
- He's a killer, ma'am.

56:45.156 --> 56:47.789
- Where is Frank Connor?
- I don't know!

56:47.791 --> 56:49.057
- Please, I'm telling the truth!
- Where is he?

56:49.059 --> 56:50.691
I don't know
where he is!

56:50.693 --> 56:52.227
- You lyin'...
- I don't know!

56:58.235 --> 57:00.369
Dispose of her!

57:00.371 --> 57:02.070
How do we get her?

57:02.072 --> 57:04.108
Grab her legs. Come on.

57:44.548 --> 57:45.814
Good to see you, Mr. Frank.

57:45.816 --> 57:47.751
How are you,
old friend?

57:49.053 --> 57:50.054
Alpana!

57:52.056 --> 57:54.825
Hope you don't mind us
dropping in for a visit.

58:04.602 --> 58:07.135
Mr. Frank.

58:07.137 --> 58:10.839
I made some good old
sage bread, and rabbit stew.

58:10.841 --> 58:12.040
Mm, thank you.

58:12.042 --> 58:14.343
You don't mind
taking us in, do you?

58:14.345 --> 58:15.711
Of course, Mr. Frank.

58:15.713 --> 58:18.249
Our home is your home.

58:20.251 --> 58:21.383
Go on.

58:21.385 --> 58:22.519
Hello.

58:23.187 --> 58:24.253
Hello.

58:24.255 --> 58:25.387
What's your names?

58:25.389 --> 58:28.290
I'm Grace, and this
is my little brother, Ethan.

58:28.292 --> 58:29.925
Nice to meet you.

58:29.927 --> 58:31.627
Good to meet you, Grace.

58:31.629 --> 58:32.828
Good to meet you, Ethan.

58:32.830 --> 58:34.531
Come, come in.

58:46.844 --> 58:49.077
I'm not trying to
be rude, Mr. Connor,

58:49.079 --> 58:53.450
but how did you make friends
with an Indian?

58:55.552 --> 58:58.487
Sa'ani here is one
of the best, uh, translators

58:58.489 --> 59:00.057
I've ever known.

59:01.925 --> 59:04.228
One of the bravest men
I ever met as well.

59:04.962 --> 59:06.497
He saved my life once.

59:07.766 --> 59:09.398
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

59:09.400 --> 59:10.901
How'd he do that?

59:13.003 --> 59:17.172
Well, um, so Sa'ani and I,
we were, uh...

59:17.174 --> 59:19.007
We served together in a unit.

59:19.009 --> 59:20.942
We were soldiers.

59:20.944 --> 59:24.346
One day, Sa'ani was,
he was serving as a scout,

59:24.348 --> 59:26.682
so he was charging up
ahead of the group,

59:26.684 --> 59:28.083
and there was a sharpshooter,

59:28.085 --> 59:32.356
and he had a bead
right on my forehead.

59:35.292 --> 59:37.492
Would've got the drop
on all of us.

59:37.494 --> 59:40.128
But Sa'ani snuck up there
with his knife, and...

59:43.400 --> 59:45.436
...ended that sharpshooter
right quick.

59:47.104 --> 59:50.005
That fella's rifle went off,
coming for him,

59:50.007 --> 59:52.076
so we had to ride to his rescue.

59:56.413 --> 59:58.082
Mr. Frank saved me.

59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.618
Yeah, but only
after you saved me.

01:00:03.755 --> 01:00:08.323
For that, I am...
eternally grateful.

01:00:08.325 --> 01:00:12.262
No, we will always be
indebted to Mr. Frank.

01:00:13.063 --> 01:00:14.631
I didn't do anything.

01:00:21.004 --> 01:00:23.107
How many people
have you two killed?

01:00:24.843 --> 01:00:27.077
I think that's a story
for another day.

01:00:28.278 --> 01:00:32.047
No disrespect,
Mr. Connor and Mr. Sa'ani,

01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:34.184
but we really need
to find our mother.

01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:39.388
Please, Mr. Connor.
You've got to help us.

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:42.359
Time's running out,
she can be in a lot of trouble.

01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:45.961
Y'all two don't be rude.

01:00:45.963 --> 01:00:48.298
Eat this here food
they've prepared for you.

01:00:48.932 --> 01:00:50.434
We'll move on soon.

01:00:55.807 --> 01:00:57.408
Very tasty, thank you.

01:01:28.672 --> 01:01:31.740
Well, well, well, Frank Connor.

01:01:31.742 --> 01:01:35.343
- Well, good to see you, hoss.
- How are you, pard?

01:01:35.345 --> 01:01:37.579
Ah, we're alive and well.
How are you?

01:01:37.581 --> 01:01:38.580
I'm okay.

01:01:38.582 --> 01:01:40.515
I'm okay, I need your
help with something.

01:01:40.517 --> 01:01:41.784
Name it.

01:01:41.786 --> 01:01:44.519
Had two kids show up
in my shack out of the blue

01:01:44.521 --> 01:01:49.624
followed by two men working
for a man named Briggs.

01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:51.726
- You heard of him?
- Heard of him?

01:01:51.728 --> 01:01:53.030
I work for him.

01:01:53.865 --> 01:01:55.363
He's a no-good scoundrel,

01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:57.800
and one of these days
I'm gonna get him.

01:01:57.802 --> 01:01:59.136
Okay.

01:02:00.971 --> 01:02:03.605
You heard of a woman
named Heather Powell?

01:02:03.607 --> 01:02:05.173
Blonde hair, green eyes?

01:02:05.175 --> 01:02:08.178
That's his wife.
Pretty young thing.

01:02:09.613 --> 01:02:11.781
Yeah.

01:02:11.783 --> 01:02:14.115
She's been missing for a week
and I need her found.

01:02:14.117 --> 01:02:17.287
- Can you do that for me?
- For you?

01:02:18.555 --> 01:02:21.958
You betcha.
I'll try and cut a trail.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.361
And if I find her,
I'll get word to you.

01:02:25.596 --> 01:02:26.663
Appreciate it.

01:02:29.968 --> 01:02:31.801
Take care.

01:02:31.803 --> 01:02:34.605
Get you a whiskey next time.
Come on.

01:03:07.571 --> 01:03:09.139
What are you doing?

01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:13.510
Miller, get out of my way!
I got Briggs's orders.

01:03:22.052 --> 01:03:23.351
Get your parcels.

01:03:23.353 --> 01:03:25.155
You're coming with us.

01:03:29.693 --> 01:03:31.359
I'm not going anywhere.

01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:33.428
Not until someone tells
me what's going on,

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.163
and where you're taking me.

01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:36.834
It's none of your business.

01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:42.137
Just leave me the hell alone.

01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:45.206
All of you.
All of you nasty men.

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:47.609
Don't any of you
animals have a heart?

01:03:47.611 --> 01:03:51.281
I've got two children
who need their mother.

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.317
Do you even know
what Briggs is doing, huh?

01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:57.419
He's not working
for the government.

01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:58.821
He's taking advantage
of all of you,

01:03:58.823 --> 01:04:01.391
you're all damn fools
for that beast of a man.

01:04:02.459 --> 01:04:06.194
So stay the hell away from me.

01:04:06.196 --> 01:04:07.863
You married him.

01:04:07.865 --> 01:04:09.666
Who's the bigger sellout?

01:04:16.573 --> 01:04:18.740
Take this dirty,
filthy, disgusting,

01:04:18.742 --> 01:04:21.111
disease-ridden whore
away from me!

01:04:28.853 --> 01:04:30.485
Oh!

01:04:30.487 --> 01:04:33.022
- Get on that horse!
- Stop!

01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:34.458
No!

01:04:36.894 --> 01:04:38.159
Ow!

01:04:45.736 --> 01:04:46.771
Let's go.

01:05:39.023 --> 01:05:40.557
Captain McCalister.

01:05:41.692 --> 01:05:45.228
- To what do I owe the pleasure?
- Major Briggs.

01:05:46.097 --> 01:05:46.996
Yes.

01:05:46.998 --> 01:05:50.398
There seems to be some
discrepancies in your reports

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.734
regarding the resale of weapons.

01:05:52.736 --> 01:05:55.270
Now, I'd like
a little explanation

01:05:55.272 --> 01:05:59.108
as to what's going on
with your activities.

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:00.442
Well, then
why don't we start

01:06:00.444 --> 01:06:02.412
by discussing my activities?

01:06:07.484 --> 01:06:08.552
Please.

01:06:12.389 --> 01:06:16.293
Now I must say,
with all due respect,

01:06:17.494 --> 01:06:19.461
from my vantage point,

01:06:19.463 --> 01:06:24.869
the operation is
rolling along just fine.

01:06:29.807 --> 01:06:32.442
Weapons are selling
to the settlers,

01:06:33.376 --> 01:06:36.379
although perhaps
I should remind you,

01:06:38.515 --> 01:06:41.853
the southwest
is quite expansive.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.453
Sometimes, it just takes
a bit more time

01:06:45.455 --> 01:06:47.724
to make contact
with each and every American.

01:06:52.329 --> 01:06:55.697
There have been a series
of unfortunate events

01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:57.900
that lead me to believe
that your guns

01:06:57.902 --> 01:07:01.937
have wound up in the hands
of the Natives and the Mexicans,

01:07:01.939 --> 01:07:04.541
and not our American settlers.

01:07:07.677 --> 01:07:11.515
Now... in fact,

01:07:12.682 --> 01:07:15.918
we have tracked
some of the weapons

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:21.025
that attacked our army
back to your stockpile.

01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:24.260
Hm.

01:07:24.262 --> 01:07:26.964
Would you care to share
some thoughts on that?

01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:30.802
Well...

01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:39.507
Captain McCalister,
if I may, uh...

01:07:39.509 --> 01:07:42.644
- speak freely.
- Please.

01:07:42.646 --> 01:07:46.581
But don't waste my time
with excuses and apologies.

01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:48.449
No, no,
I'm not a time-waster,

01:07:48.451 --> 01:07:50.152
nor do I offer excuses.

01:07:50.154 --> 01:07:52.453
But I will tell you this much.

01:07:52.455 --> 01:07:55.825
If you don't stop crawling
so far up my asshole,

01:07:55.827 --> 01:07:58.194
I will be notifying
President Grant

01:07:58.196 --> 01:07:59.795
of your continued ongoings

01:07:59.797 --> 01:08:02.865
with a sweet little
something named Jenny.

01:08:02.867 --> 01:08:07.402
Hard-boiled eggs are yellow
on the inside, Mr. Briggs.

01:08:07.404 --> 01:08:09.470
Are you sure
you wanna run around

01:08:09.472 --> 01:08:13.575
spreading gossip like
some big-city reporter?

01:08:13.577 --> 01:08:16.477
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to clear your name

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:19.014
and show the White House
that your weapons

01:08:19.015 --> 01:08:22.649
are making it into the hands
of our settlers!

01:08:22.652 --> 01:08:25.622
And not the Mexicans
and the Indians!

01:08:28.024 --> 01:08:32.594
And I hope that these instances
of malfeasance or anomalies

01:08:32.595 --> 01:08:33.761
are not the norm.

01:08:33.764 --> 01:08:37.599
And if I don't see production
from your little outfit here,

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.435
I will take it away from you,

01:08:40.437 --> 01:08:44.008
and send you back to
South Georgia where you belong!

01:08:46.176 --> 01:08:48.643
Oh, and Mr. Briggs.

01:08:48.645 --> 01:08:54.917
I will make sure
you see Valdosta again.

01:08:54.919 --> 01:08:58.620
Only this time, you won't
be wearing a uniform.

01:08:58.622 --> 01:09:00.956
You'll be target practice
for the Union Army

01:09:00.957 --> 01:09:03.426
who still doesn't know
the war is over.

01:09:05.763 --> 01:09:09.532
- Good day.
- Good day, Captain.

01:09:11.468 --> 01:09:12.770
Always a pleasure.

01:09:18.475 --> 01:09:20.176
Don't you start a war with me.

01:09:22.444 --> 01:09:24.712
I'm afraid you might not like
how I fight.

01:09:24.714 --> 01:09:26.180
Round up.

01:09:33.057 --> 01:09:34.091
<i>Violet!</i>

01:09:50.607 --> 01:09:53.210
Travis Briggs, huh?

01:09:55.112 --> 01:09:57.148
Where'd you come up
with that one, huh?

01:09:58.581 --> 01:10:00.918
Did you get it
from some soldier you killed?

01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:05.222
Connor.

01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:08.759
Is that it? Hm?

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:10.658
"Connor?"

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.797
That's all you got
to say to me, huh?

01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:14.797
After all these years,

01:10:14.799 --> 01:10:16.698
after everything
we've been through together,

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.967
after everything you've done?

01:10:17.969 --> 01:10:20.004
That's all you've got
to say to me?

01:10:23.307 --> 01:10:24.607
You can go to hell.

01:10:37.054 --> 01:10:40.690
Well, I see you
haven't changed, Henry.

01:10:42.026 --> 01:10:44.360
Except maybe your name.

01:10:44.362 --> 01:10:48.565
Yes, "Travis" does sound like
less of a traitor than Henry.

01:10:52.736 --> 01:10:55.237
Heather sure as hell
likes it better.

01:10:58.075 --> 01:11:01.276
Well, finally,
after all these years,

01:11:01.278 --> 01:11:03.544
I found out who she ran to.

01:11:03.546 --> 01:11:05.881
Mm, let's
be honest, Connor.

01:11:05.883 --> 01:11:08.450
You were out of the picture
a long time before that.

01:11:08.452 --> 01:11:10.587
Plus she never even loved you.

01:11:11.455 --> 01:11:13.554
Well, it don't matter anyway.

01:11:13.556 --> 01:11:16.726
Oh, no? How's that?

01:11:19.363 --> 01:11:21.132
'Cause I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you.

01:11:23.467 --> 01:11:24.869
I'm sure you are.

01:11:26.569 --> 01:11:29.537
I know what you've been up to
since the war.

01:11:29.539 --> 01:11:32.141
Meanwhile,
I've been getting rich,

01:11:32.143 --> 01:11:34.945
you... become a gunman.

01:11:36.113 --> 01:11:38.783
Now, how are you gonna
explain that to your kids?

01:11:39.817 --> 01:11:43.118
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, Connor.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:46.757
A mother and her two babies
that you walked out on.

01:11:48.125 --> 01:11:49.160
Where are they?

01:11:50.428 --> 01:11:51.994
I know you got 'em.

01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:58.267
I didn't walk out on no one.

01:11:58.269 --> 01:12:00.601
Oh, no? What would you call it?

01:12:00.603 --> 01:12:01.837
I roll my own hoop

01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:04.406
and I am tired of the job
of some shadow rider.

01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:05.776
Now take a seat.

01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:22.259
Now think
this through, Frank.

01:12:24.195 --> 01:12:25.327
You can't kill me.

01:12:25.329 --> 01:12:26.729
Oh, yeah? Why not?

01:12:29.467 --> 01:12:31.168
'Cause I got Heather.

01:12:40.444 --> 01:12:42.044
You hear that, Connor?

01:12:42.046 --> 01:12:44.647
You didn't think
I thought this through, did ya?

01:12:45.783 --> 01:12:47.785
I'm gonna have
this place surrounded.

01:12:48.486 --> 01:12:50.085
They see everything.

01:12:50.087 --> 01:12:51.922
Connor, come out
with your hands up!

01:12:52.689 --> 01:12:53.755
You're gonna get a bullet

01:12:53.757 --> 01:12:55.826
you ain't gonna be able
to digest!

01:13:01.098 --> 01:13:03.234
Hello. Hello.

01:13:04.568 --> 01:13:06.203
They know who you are.

01:13:08.372 --> 01:13:10.705
Ain't no secrets here.

01:13:10.707 --> 01:13:12.810
Where the hell
you scissorbills been?

01:13:13.944 --> 01:13:15.710
This traitor
damn near killed me.

01:13:15.712 --> 01:13:17.613
Sorry, sir. We got here
as soon as possible.

01:13:17.615 --> 01:13:19.747
As soon as possible?
Thought you was tracking me.

01:13:19.749 --> 01:13:21.183
You said you didn't want
to be tracked.

01:13:21.185 --> 01:13:22.253
Yeah, no matter.

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:27.758
Get him out of my house
before I blow his guts out.

01:13:28.492 --> 01:13:29.960
Let's go, come on.

01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:34.429
- Let's go!
- Go!

01:13:34.431 --> 01:13:36.131
Keep it movin'.

01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:38.435
And find my kids!

01:13:42.273 --> 01:13:45.807
Come on, you two.
All four of you.

01:13:45.809 --> 01:13:48.012
He's just taking
advantage of you.

01:13:48.779 --> 01:13:51.547
I mean, you know that, right?

01:13:51.549 --> 01:13:52.983
You know all this.

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:56.118
Killed his own men.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.589
I mean, you know what Briggs
is up to, don't you?

01:14:00.591 --> 01:14:02.591
I mean, I have to assume
you all know that

01:14:02.593 --> 01:14:04.725
Briggs ain't even his real name.

01:14:04.727 --> 01:14:09.097
See, Connor, nothing
you say is gonna convince us.

01:14:09.099 --> 01:14:11.867
I suggest you keep
your mouth shut,

01:14:11.869 --> 01:14:13.734
or I'll have no choice
but to gag ya.

01:14:14.805 --> 01:14:16.271
You broke the law,
you're going to prison.

01:14:16.273 --> 01:14:17.139
The law?

01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:20.244
Oh, we're way,
way above the law here.

01:14:21.779 --> 01:14:23.345
I mean, you do realize that boy,

01:14:23.347 --> 01:14:25.781
his real name
is Henry T. Bartlett.

01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:27.082
He's a wanted criminal

01:14:27.084 --> 01:14:28.917
for killing innocent women
and children,

01:14:28.919 --> 01:14:30.786
but y'all are too stupid
to even know that.

01:14:30.788 --> 01:14:32.054
Just ignore him.

01:14:32.056 --> 01:14:33.488
Is that what Briggs is up to?

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:34.990
It ain't none of our business.

01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:36.692
He's probably even
screwing your wives.

01:14:36.694 --> 01:14:37.962
Whoa!

01:14:38.462 --> 01:14:39.763
My wife?

01:14:42.633 --> 01:14:44.001
Pete, gag him!

01:14:47.071 --> 01:14:48.973
Pete, what the hell?

01:14:50.908 --> 01:14:52.774
Connor!

01:14:52.776 --> 01:14:54.443
Don't let him get away!
Right there!

01:14:54.445 --> 01:14:55.677
Damn it. Connor!

01:14:55.679 --> 01:14:57.446
Don't let him
get away!

01:14:57.448 --> 01:14:59.481
You can't hide
from us!

01:14:59.483 --> 01:15:01.383
Go to the back, Pete.

01:15:01.385 --> 01:15:02.453
Where is he?

01:15:05.623 --> 01:15:07.656
Over here, over here!

01:15:07.658 --> 01:15:09.326
Anybody see anything?

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.393
Circle around!

01:15:11.395 --> 01:15:13.662
Circle around, and listen!

01:15:13.664 --> 01:15:14.730
Circle around!

01:15:14.732 --> 01:15:16.467
Fire a shot
if you hear anything.

01:15:20.904 --> 01:15:22.439
I don't see him, Feldman.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.245
Don't shoot him.

01:15:29.513 --> 01:15:31.313
You hear me? Don't shoot him.

01:15:31.315 --> 01:15:33.081
Briggs wants him alive.

01:15:33.083 --> 01:15:34.285
You boys see anything?

01:15:37.855 --> 01:15:40.489
I see something
over here!

01:15:40.491 --> 01:15:41.790
Circle that way.

01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:43.861
Go around to the left
and to the right.

01:15:44.962 --> 01:15:46.962
And then come back this way.

01:15:46.964 --> 01:15:50.132
Come back towards me,
just flush him out towards me.

01:15:50.134 --> 01:15:51.233
Connor?

01:15:52.503 --> 01:15:53.504
You see him?

01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:56.738
He didn't go far.

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.442
Everybody shut
up for a minute!

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:01.778
Flush him out!

01:16:05.349 --> 01:16:07.382
Don't fire your guns!

01:16:07.384 --> 01:16:08.785
You see him?

01:16:08.787 --> 01:16:10.888
Don't fire,
just listen.

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.691
Flag him.

01:16:15.693 --> 01:16:17.059
Stop it!

01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:18.795
Briggs is gonna be
pissed off!

01:16:18.797 --> 01:16:20.629
Did you get him?

01:16:20.631 --> 01:16:22.831
We gotta
find him, boys.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:25.133
Yeah, but we're going
nowhere goddamn near.

01:16:25.135 --> 01:16:26.435
- He can't be that far away.
- Make him go

01:16:26.437 --> 01:16:27.402
to the back towards me.

01:16:27.404 --> 01:16:29.504
Briggs is gonna be
one pissed off son of a bitch

01:16:29.506 --> 01:16:30.574
if we don't find him!

01:16:31.909 --> 01:16:34.309
Man's tied,
can't go far.

01:16:37.715 --> 01:16:39.416
Come on, boys!

01:16:39.883 --> 01:16:41.151
Anything?

01:16:42.754 --> 01:16:44.221
Hold your fire.

01:16:47.391 --> 01:16:49.958
Quiet, quiet,
I hear something.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.126
Be quiet.

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:53.063
- Check that!
- Over here!

01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:58.902
I don't see him,
I don't see nothing!

01:17:02.106 --> 01:17:05.173
Come on, hurry up!
Briggs is gonna kill us.

01:17:05.175 --> 01:17:06.610
Couldn't
have gone far.

01:17:40.677 --> 01:17:42.177
Come on boys,
let's go!

01:17:42.179 --> 01:17:44.181
He's getting away! Come on!

01:17:45.850 --> 01:17:47.551
You okay, Feldman?

01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:25.722
Sa'ani!

01:18:30.727 --> 01:18:32.062
Alpana!

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:36.099
Grace! Ethan!

01:18:41.873 --> 01:18:43.273
Ah, shit.

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:56.587
Sa'ani!

01:18:57.588 --> 01:18:59.423
Alpana!

01:19:01.124 --> 01:19:03.594
Grace! Ethan!

01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:13.504
Sa'ani, Sa'ani, Sa'ani.
Hey, hey.

01:19:14.438 --> 01:19:15.472
Mr. Frank.

01:19:16.473 --> 01:19:17.674
I'm sorry.

01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:21.009
Sorry. I let you down.

01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:22.577
No, no, no, no.

01:19:22.579 --> 01:19:25.580
No, Sa'ani.
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:19:25.582 --> 01:19:27.382
Okay?
I'm gonna fix this.

01:19:27.384 --> 01:19:30.687
Mr. Frank. I'll be okay.

01:19:37.728 --> 01:19:39.363
All take good care of me.

01:19:39.931 --> 01:19:40.997
Sa'ani.

01:19:40.999 --> 01:19:42.464
Sa'ani, you stay with me,
all right?

01:19:42.466 --> 01:19:44.366
You hear me? You stay with me.

01:19:44.368 --> 01:19:46.537
You stay with me, hey!

01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:49.704
Peace comes within.

01:19:51.876 --> 01:19:54.177
Do not seek without.

01:20:16.166 --> 01:20:18.233
Who the hell are you?

01:20:18.235 --> 01:20:19.771
It don't matter.

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.271
Well, at least
tell me your name,

01:20:23.273 --> 01:20:25.742
so I can kick your ass
in the afterlife.

01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:29.311
I'm like you.

01:20:29.313 --> 01:20:32.949
Been left behind with nothing
to do with my skills,

01:20:32.951 --> 01:20:34.451
but to kill.

01:20:35.719 --> 01:20:38.689
Briggs send you?

01:20:40.858 --> 01:20:42.092
All right.

01:20:42.827 --> 01:20:44.626
Why don't you pull that trigger?

01:20:44.628 --> 01:20:48.096
The government
made us who we are.

01:20:48.098 --> 01:20:52.169
You can either fight it,
or embrace it.

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:54.438
You can go to hell.

01:21:40.084 --> 01:21:42.384
Mr. Frank.

01:21:42.386 --> 01:21:45.520
No, no, no.

01:21:45.522 --> 01:21:49.192
Sa'ani! No!

01:21:55.565 --> 01:21:57.099
Sa'ani.

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:10.414
I'm sorry.

01:22:15.519 --> 01:22:18.890
He loved you like a brother.

01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:23.191
I'm so sorry.

01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:25.761
He was a great
and honorable man.

01:22:50.188 --> 01:22:51.621
Who is he?

01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:54.826
Someone I used to know.

01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:04.532
Alpana, we have to go.

01:23:04.534 --> 01:23:06.971
We can't stay here,
it's too dangerous.

01:23:08.605 --> 01:23:09.841
No.

01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:12.741
I will not go.

01:23:16.747 --> 01:23:17.915
You go.

01:23:19.784 --> 01:23:21.416
Are you sure?

01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:23.988
I, I... I can't leave you here.

01:23:28.025 --> 01:23:29.693
I will stay here.

01:23:32.329 --> 01:23:34.297
Where are Grace
and Ethan?

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:37.667
They are by the creek.

01:23:41.072 --> 01:23:42.739
I'll be back for you.

01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:27.819
Hey, you kids okay?

01:24:47.004 --> 01:24:48.572
Strange how a...

01:24:50.842 --> 01:24:53.476
How a cowardly wolf
like myself...

01:24:55.279 --> 01:24:57.279
don't have the guts
to tell two little kids

01:24:57.281 --> 01:24:58.481
how he feels.

01:25:03.788 --> 01:25:05.687
I just hope the two of you
know how sorry I am

01:25:05.689 --> 01:25:07.657
for not being there
for you and your mom.

01:25:10.493 --> 01:25:11.961
And you might not believe in me,

01:25:11.963 --> 01:25:14.362
but I, but I did write your mom
a lot more letters

01:25:14.364 --> 01:25:15.867
than the ones you found.

01:25:19.469 --> 01:25:22.907
She never returned any
of them, but...

01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:29.646
you two have been
on my mind ever since.

01:25:33.284 --> 01:25:34.952
Ever since I walked out.

01:25:41.225 --> 01:25:45.462
Anyway, we'll get your mom back.

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:47.631
Maybe...

01:25:49.133 --> 01:25:51.869
just maybe, I can convince her
to take me back,

01:25:54.105 --> 01:25:55.806
and we can be a family again.

01:25:58.242 --> 01:25:59.609
What do you say?

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.614
Does that sound like a plan?

01:26:09.353 --> 01:26:10.654
I...

01:26:12.957 --> 01:26:16.859
Anyway, nothing wrong
with dreaming.

01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:50.161
You're one pretty little filly.

01:26:50.895 --> 01:26:52.560
No. No, no, no.

01:26:52.562 --> 01:26:55.230
I think she's the best
blanket companion around.

01:26:55.232 --> 01:26:56.631
Ain't she, boys?

01:26:56.633 --> 01:26:59.001
Get her off the horse!

01:26:59.003 --> 01:27:02.204
Please, please, please, no!
Please, no!

01:27:02.206 --> 01:27:03.638
No!

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.176
- No! No! No!
- Come on. Come on.

01:27:07.178 --> 01:27:08.478
No!

01:27:10.147 --> 01:27:11.512
Relax.

01:27:11.514 --> 01:27:13.248
You're gonna have a great time.

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:14.615
Here you go, boss.

01:27:14.617 --> 01:27:18.555
No, please! Please, please.

01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:22.159
Believe me,
little lady.

01:27:23.327 --> 01:27:25.562
You're gonna like it.

01:27:27.431 --> 01:27:30.933
Come on!
Move! Move it!

01:27:30.935 --> 01:27:33.137
I don't have time for this,
let's go.

01:27:34.504 --> 01:27:36.205
Now.

01:27:39.944 --> 01:27:41.676
Now listen! Quiet.

01:27:41.678 --> 01:27:42.913
Stop fighting me.

01:27:43.881 --> 01:27:45.881
Now listen.

01:27:45.883 --> 01:27:48.050
I want you to climb over
that mountain.

01:27:48.052 --> 01:27:50.685
Tomorrow morning,
there'll be a stage coming in.

01:27:50.687 --> 01:27:51.854
Carson will be driving it.

01:27:51.856 --> 01:27:54.591
Now get on that stage,
he'll take you in safely.

01:27:55.926 --> 01:27:58.961
What are you...
Why are you helping me?

01:27:58.963 --> 01:28:00.362
Who are you?

01:28:00.364 --> 01:28:01.997
That's not important.

01:28:01.999 --> 01:28:03.098
Here.

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.934
This will help you
get over the mountain.

01:28:05.936 --> 01:28:07.568
Now go, get out!

01:28:07.570 --> 01:28:09.306
Thank you, thank you!

01:28:44.241 --> 01:28:45.309
Oh, boys!

01:28:47.778 --> 01:28:49.511
Where's the woman?

01:28:49.513 --> 01:28:50.946
Just mount up, the party's over.

01:28:50.948 --> 01:28:52.747
What do you mean
the party's over?

01:28:52.749 --> 01:28:54.883
She ain't fit
for a drinking man.

01:28:54.885 --> 01:28:56.985
She slapped me,
I killed her.

01:28:56.987 --> 01:28:58.020
You killed her?

01:28:58.022 --> 01:29:00.322
Ah, Briggs ain't gonna be
liking that.

01:29:00.324 --> 01:29:01.757
It don't matter.

01:29:01.759 --> 01:29:04.460
- Now let's go, mount up!
- Mount?

01:29:04.462 --> 01:29:06.562
"M-O-N-T"! Mount, now!

01:29:09.133 --> 01:29:10.201
Oh, boys.

01:29:11.769 --> 01:29:13.569
She killed you too.

01:30:00.017 --> 01:30:01.285
Frank!

01:30:02.253 --> 01:30:03.852
Is that you?

01:30:03.854 --> 01:30:06.555
Yeah, Paw. It's me.

01:30:06.557 --> 01:30:08.290
What the hell
are you doing out here

01:30:08.292 --> 01:30:10.359
in the middle of my land?

01:30:10.361 --> 01:30:12.127
Long story.

01:30:12.129 --> 01:30:14.798
Put the rifle down
and I'll explain it to you.

01:30:15.299 --> 01:30:16.300
Sure.

01:30:24.041 --> 01:30:26.210
Love what you've done
with the place.

01:30:31.649 --> 01:30:34.151
Hey, Paw, long time.

01:30:35.319 --> 01:30:39.323
Ah, Frank! My favorite son.

01:30:41.325 --> 01:30:43.792
Hey, just keep
your voice down, okay?

01:30:43.794 --> 01:30:46.729
Why? No one can hear us
from miles around.

01:30:47.298 --> 01:30:48.597
Hey.

01:30:51.468 --> 01:30:53.771
Hey, whose are those?

01:30:54.238 --> 01:30:56.138
They, uh...

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.473
Well, I think
they're your grandkids.

01:30:58.475 --> 01:31:03.247
I told you,
you ain't fit for adopting.

01:31:05.683 --> 01:31:08.250
It's a long story,
but they're kin.

01:31:08.252 --> 01:31:10.754
Can you help me get them
inside and I'll explain?

01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:13.723
Mm, sure.

01:31:14.425 --> 01:31:15.492
Come on.

01:31:26.537 --> 01:31:27.871
Come on.

01:32:42.079 --> 01:32:45.182
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:32:47.084 --> 01:32:49.551
You look like you're on
the wrong coach.

01:32:49.553 --> 01:32:51.055
I'm fine, thank you.

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.062
You can talk to us.

01:32:59.997 --> 01:33:02.066
We ain't afraid of no issues.

01:33:03.167 --> 01:33:05.903
There ain't nothing
we haven't experienced.

01:33:07.004 --> 01:33:08.103
Young lady.

01:33:08.105 --> 01:33:10.005
I've been riding on this coach
for three days,

01:33:10.007 --> 01:33:12.240
and I am sick and tired
of your dribble.

01:33:14.779 --> 01:33:16.878
I didn't mean to start a fuss.

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:20.217
I'm just trying to get back
to my children.

01:33:22.754 --> 01:33:24.321
You ain't whorin'?

01:33:25.522 --> 01:33:27.489
I thought Mr. Carson stopped
and picked you up

01:33:27.491 --> 01:33:29.526
'cause you're going to town
to work with us.

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.261
No, ma'am.

01:33:32.129 --> 01:33:33.395
Uh...

01:33:33.397 --> 01:33:35.399
Then what are you doing
on this coach?

01:33:36.667 --> 01:33:39.370
If it's all right with you,
I'd rather not say.

01:33:40.971 --> 01:33:43.138
I'm the madam of the saloon

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:44.873
that this here coach
is heading to,

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:46.410
so you best be telling me,

01:33:47.311 --> 01:33:49.177
or I'll tell Mr. Carson
to pull over

01:33:49.179 --> 01:33:50.579
and we'll throw you out,

01:33:50.581 --> 01:33:53.617
and you can die
in this godforsaken desert.

01:34:00.491 --> 01:34:01.925
I was kidnapped.

01:34:03.327 --> 01:34:05.662
You don't look like
you've been kidnapped to me.

01:34:07.698 --> 01:34:10.067
I was kidnapped
by my own husband.

01:34:12.536 --> 01:34:14.438
Your husband kidnapped you?

01:34:16.875 --> 01:34:20.043
That's exactly why I ain't ever
getting married.

01:34:21.678 --> 01:34:23.213
I just use men for money.

01:34:24.816 --> 01:34:26.314
Ain't nothing a man's
gonna do for me

01:34:26.316 --> 01:34:28.483
that I can't do for myself.

01:34:28.485 --> 01:34:31.388
All right, missy.
That's enough, you hush up.

01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:36.126
You know, I think
you might be right about that.

01:34:40.063 --> 01:34:42.063
Well, your children are
the most important thing

01:34:42.065 --> 01:34:43.567
in the whole world.

01:34:45.002 --> 01:34:47.169
My parents didn't pay
no attention to me,

01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:52.242
now I'm 18 years old,
whoring all over the west.

01:34:53.243 --> 01:34:56.011
That's enough,
you hush up!

01:34:56.013 --> 01:34:57.646
Or you're gonna be out with her.

01:34:57.648 --> 01:34:59.116
No more whoring for you.

01:35:09.526 --> 01:35:10.727
You have a daughter?

01:35:13.297 --> 01:35:14.431
Yes.

01:35:15.132 --> 01:35:16.733
Her name is Grace.

01:35:21.138 --> 01:35:22.372
Well, ma'am...

01:35:24.943 --> 01:35:26.743
I want you to go find Grace

01:35:28.045 --> 01:35:30.245
and educate her real good,

01:35:30.247 --> 01:35:32.683
so she don't end up
like one of us.

01:35:36.353 --> 01:35:37.519
Okay?

01:35:42.659 --> 01:35:44.394
You seem like a good woman.

01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:49.233
I wish my mom
were more like you.

01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:54.669
Those kids of yours
are real lucky

01:35:54.671 --> 01:35:57.007
to have such a strong woman
for a momma.

01:36:00.778 --> 01:36:01.779
Thank you.

01:36:28.907 --> 01:36:30.305
Jake! No!

01:36:30.307 --> 01:36:33.074
Die, you sons of bitches!

01:36:34.278 --> 01:36:35.744
What are you doing?

01:36:35.746 --> 01:36:37.078
Down, buddy! What are you doing?

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.146
What are you doing?

01:36:38.148 --> 01:36:39.548
I hit at least three more
of those blue bellies,

01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:40.584
they were mine!

01:36:45.289 --> 01:36:47.291
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

01:36:50.627 --> 01:36:53.530
- Get us outta here, Frank.
- Hey!

01:36:55.033 --> 01:36:56.266
Listen up!

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:58.466
We got two other men

01:36:58.468 --> 01:37:00.201
left up there on the outside,
haven't we?

01:37:00.203 --> 01:37:02.203
We're gonna go get them.

01:37:02.205 --> 01:37:04.639
He's empty, Frank,
ain't going no place.

01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:06.243
We're gonna go get 'em.

01:37:07.011 --> 01:37:08.443
Gibson!

01:37:08.445 --> 01:37:10.445
Hey! We're gonna get
on top of that hill

01:37:10.447 --> 01:37:11.580
and give us some cover,
all right?

01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:13.983
Start firing down
on those blue boys.

01:37:13.985 --> 01:37:16.752
You're gonna go get those boys
on this side of the hill.

01:37:16.754 --> 01:37:19.287
You get up there and you
start fucking firing, now.

01:37:19.289 --> 01:37:20.923
I ain't going no place, Frank.

01:37:20.925 --> 01:37:23.258
This ain't a fight,
this is suicide.

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:26.028
This command does not run
from a fight,

01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:28.229
and we do not leave
our men behind.

01:37:28.231 --> 01:37:29.765
Grow something
that looks like a spine

01:37:29.767 --> 01:37:31.867
and you get up there, now!

01:37:35.372 --> 01:37:37.174
What the hell are you doing?

01:37:38.943 --> 01:37:40.175
Where are you going?

01:37:40.177 --> 01:37:42.711
Hightailing it out of here!

01:37:42.713 --> 01:37:45.415
You come back here,
you yellow-bellied coward!

01:37:49.152 --> 01:37:50.554
What are you doing?

01:38:05.803 --> 01:38:07.170
Ow!

01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:32.496
Grace!

01:38:33.097 --> 01:38:34.498
Ethan!

01:38:37.935 --> 01:38:39.200
Woo-hoo!

01:38:39.202 --> 01:38:40.602
That's nice.

01:38:45.509 --> 01:38:47.143
You're a natural!

01:38:47.145 --> 01:38:49.277
Hey! Hold your fire!

01:38:49.279 --> 01:38:51.346
Hold your fire!

01:38:51.348 --> 01:38:53.450
Give me that! Give me that!

01:38:54.786 --> 01:38:56.219
Why'd you do that?

01:38:57.055 --> 01:38:59.121
Guns aren't for kids, okay?

01:38:59.123 --> 01:39:00.355
Well, Mr. Connor said

01:39:00.357 --> 01:39:02.459
that you owned your first gun
at six years old.

01:39:06.130 --> 01:39:08.563
Well, things are different now.

01:39:08.565 --> 01:39:10.532
- Okay?
- What's different?

01:39:10.534 --> 01:39:12.935
Seems to me nothing changed
around here in the earth.

01:39:12.937 --> 01:39:14.504
I'm different. Okay?

01:39:16.473 --> 01:39:18.206
Besides, I've seen
what these things can do

01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:19.844
when they fall into
the wrong hands.

01:39:30.188 --> 01:39:32.088
Would you...

01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:33.421
Would you kids go
inside, please?

01:39:33.423 --> 01:39:34.892
I need to talk to my pop.

01:39:48.705 --> 01:39:50.808
- I'm gonna beat you!
- In your dreams.

01:39:53.276 --> 01:39:54.979
Ah, you showed them.

01:39:58.448 --> 01:40:02.285
Well, that's the way
you taught me, I guess.

01:40:03.921 --> 01:40:05.689
Bluster. Anger.

01:40:08.793 --> 01:40:10.625
And listen, son, you...

01:40:10.627 --> 01:40:13.263
You have some bright kids there.

01:40:16.299 --> 01:40:18.700
Yeah.

01:40:18.702 --> 01:40:23.607
Now I'm just happy to find out
I'm their grandpa.

01:40:24.942 --> 01:40:28.811
I just want to make
sure you don't screw this up.

01:40:28.813 --> 01:40:32.817
I just want you
to be a family again.

01:40:34.284 --> 01:40:36.620
I think you need
to fix this, son.

01:40:38.522 --> 01:40:40.388
With all due respect,
you just don't know

01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:41.826
what you're talking about.

01:40:44.228 --> 01:40:47.029
Look, Dad, that life...

01:40:47.031 --> 01:40:48.463
That life is dead.

01:40:48.465 --> 01:40:50.398
It's... It's gone.

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:57.139
Okay?

01:40:57.141 --> 01:40:58.475
It's just...

01:41:00.978 --> 01:41:02.046
I can't.

01:41:04.648 --> 01:41:07.216
What the hell you talkin' about?

01:41:07.218 --> 01:41:11.887
Remember that, the man
who knows how to die standing

01:41:11.889 --> 01:41:15.425
is the one who keeps it coming,
you know that.

01:41:19.396 --> 01:41:20.965
What happened to you?

01:41:23.968 --> 01:41:25.669
He's a kid, okay?

01:41:27.839 --> 01:41:29.941
Will you look after them
for a while?

01:41:32.642 --> 01:41:34.877
Leave them with me,
that'd be all right.

01:41:34.879 --> 01:41:37.380
I'm the only one here
for a hundred miles.

01:41:43.453 --> 01:41:44.856
Yeah.

01:41:46.057 --> 01:41:47.992
We're gonna make this right.

01:41:57.134 --> 01:41:58.801
All right.

01:43:50.348 --> 01:43:53.816
What the hell you mean
she's dead?

01:43:53.818 --> 01:43:58.387
So the report is, Miss Powell
was killed by one of the men

01:43:58.389 --> 01:43:59.890
when they were moving her.

01:44:06.663 --> 01:44:08.230
Where are you gettin' this from?

01:44:08.232 --> 01:44:09.566
Harrison, sir.

01:44:10.935 --> 01:44:12.203
Hmm.

01:44:20.177 --> 01:44:21.212
Bring him in.

01:44:25.483 --> 01:44:27.051
Harrison.

01:44:45.635 --> 01:44:47.271
What'd you do with my wife?

01:44:48.605 --> 01:44:51.473
Well, we were setting up camp.

01:44:51.475 --> 01:44:52.640
She had to relieve herself,

01:44:52.642 --> 01:44:55.612
so Sharperson took her over
to some privacy.

01:44:56.713 --> 01:44:58.816
She pulled his gun and shot him.

01:45:01.819 --> 01:45:04.286
And she ran back where McCabe
was making the fire,

01:45:04.288 --> 01:45:05.622
and she shot him.

01:45:12.930 --> 01:45:14.496
What about you?

01:45:14.498 --> 01:45:17.132
I was tending horses.

01:45:17.134 --> 01:45:19.501
When I heard the gunshots,
I came running over,

01:45:19.503 --> 01:45:22.239
but she pointed the gun at me.

01:45:23.441 --> 01:45:25.841
I gave her a lead pill.

01:45:25.843 --> 01:45:29.213
I'm sorry,
but it was her or me.

01:45:39.722 --> 01:45:41.092
Where's the body?

01:45:44.061 --> 01:45:45.196
I buried her.

01:45:46.464 --> 01:45:48.165
Left the other two
for wolf bait.

01:45:50.234 --> 01:45:51.268
Don't worry.

01:45:52.269 --> 01:45:56.305
I said a prayer, over them.

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:11.186
Easy, boys.

01:46:11.188 --> 01:46:14.022
I don't think I'm gonna
let you kill me today.

01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:24.867
You lousy son of a bitch!

01:46:24.869 --> 01:46:25.934
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

01:46:25.936 --> 01:46:27.836
We'll never find his weapons
if we kill him.

01:46:27.838 --> 01:46:30.007
Don't worry, sir,
we'll get him.

01:46:40.985 --> 01:46:42.717
What the hell kind
of rinky-dink operation

01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:45.020
are we running around here, huh?

01:46:45.022 --> 01:46:47.158
I'm truly sorry
about your wife, sir.

01:46:48.392 --> 01:46:49.491
Are you some kind of idiot?

01:46:49.493 --> 01:46:51.162
I don't give a damn
about my wife!

01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:52.963
You don't?

01:46:55.599 --> 01:46:57.902
I want Connor.

01:46:59.702 --> 01:47:00.938
Sir.

01:47:02.139 --> 01:47:06.241
I'm just not clear on why
you want Connor so much,

01:47:06.243 --> 01:47:08.577
why you care about
him so much right now.

01:47:08.579 --> 01:47:10.012
Frank Connor...

01:47:10.014 --> 01:47:13.015
works for a specific faction
of our government,

01:47:13.017 --> 01:47:16.652
who's interfering
with my distribution channels

01:47:16.654 --> 01:47:18.222
and killing 'em off!

01:47:21.892 --> 01:47:24.993
That is a major conflict
of interest,

01:47:24.995 --> 01:47:27.362
and all-on war department.

01:47:32.702 --> 01:47:34.737
Do not let appearances fool you.

01:47:38.209 --> 01:47:40.008
Once we kill Connor,

01:47:40.010 --> 01:47:42.112
we cut off one
of their major legs.

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.281
But, sir...

01:47:45.683 --> 01:47:47.916
Why don't we just find out

01:47:47.918 --> 01:47:49.420
which department
he's working with,

01:47:50.187 --> 01:47:51.587
and work it out?

01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:54.223
There is a faction
of the government

01:47:54.225 --> 01:47:55.924
that is fucking
with my business,

01:47:55.926 --> 01:47:57.494
and I ain't gonna stand for it!

01:49:15.906 --> 01:49:19.143
- And, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!

01:49:21.545 --> 01:49:23.378
You a friend of Harrison's?

01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:24.781
Are you Frank Connor?

01:49:24.783 --> 01:49:25.847
Yes, sir.

01:49:25.849 --> 01:49:27.951
I have a passenger for you.

01:49:28.485 --> 01:49:29.752
What's going on?

01:49:29.754 --> 01:49:31.754
Mr. Carson,
why are we stopping?

01:49:31.756 --> 01:49:33.490
You keep this coach rolling.

01:49:40.664 --> 01:49:41.932
Heather.

01:49:42.466 --> 01:49:44.333
Uh...

01:49:44.335 --> 01:49:47.338
It's, uh... It's me, it's Frank.

01:50:01.585 --> 01:50:03.285
How?

01:50:03.287 --> 01:50:05.987
Where did you come from?
How did you find me?

01:50:05.989 --> 01:50:09.591
Uh, well, um, I...
I have the kids.

01:50:09.593 --> 01:50:12.361
I have your...
Your kids, Grace and Ethan.

01:50:12.363 --> 01:50:13.695
You have Grace
and Ethan?

01:50:13.697 --> 01:50:15.364
Where... where are they?
Are they safe?

01:50:15.366 --> 01:50:16.732
They're at my father's house,
they're safe.

01:50:16.734 --> 01:50:18.135
But we gotta go.

01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:20.537
Take me to them.

01:50:26.811 --> 01:50:29.446
Ma'am. I know
you don't like me much.

01:50:31.281 --> 01:50:33.350
But please take care
of that one for me.

01:50:35.986 --> 01:50:37.252
Would ya?

01:50:43.762 --> 01:50:45.095
Take me to my kids.

01:50:46.865 --> 01:50:48.265
Oh!

01:50:54.773 --> 01:50:56.106
Ladies.

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.242
Come on.

01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:05.247
I tell you what,

01:51:05.249 --> 01:51:06.783
it's strange little Grace
and Ethan

01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:07.884
showing up at my place,

01:51:07.886 --> 01:51:09.951
some story about how
you'd been kidnapped,

01:51:09.953 --> 01:51:12.020
and you ain't been seen
in a week,

01:51:12.022 --> 01:51:13.121
and they're all worried

01:51:13.123 --> 01:51:14.289
and think something
happened to you.

01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:16.693
So, they asked for my help,
that's all.

01:51:18.095 --> 01:51:20.863
Ain't no...
Ain't no mystery to it.

01:51:20.865 --> 01:51:23.532
Well, I'm thankful
that you have them

01:51:23.534 --> 01:51:24.834
and that they're safe,

01:51:24.836 --> 01:51:27.669
and I'm thankful that you
are taking me to them now.

01:51:27.671 --> 01:51:30.305
- Yes.
- So please do that.

01:51:30.307 --> 01:51:32.073
Look, I'm not trying
to weasel my way

01:51:32.075 --> 01:51:33.742
- back in your heart, I...
- Aren't you?

01:51:33.744 --> 01:51:35.544
- No, I...
- Aren't you though?

01:51:35.546 --> 01:51:37.412
No, no.

01:51:37.414 --> 01:51:40.949
I'm just, look, I'm trying
to help you out, is all.

01:51:40.951 --> 01:51:43.587
Take me to my children,
that will help me a lot.

01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:49.090
Listen, Frank,
I am very grateful.

01:51:49.092 --> 01:51:51.526
But you can't just
come back in my life,

01:51:51.528 --> 01:51:54.129
into my children's lives
like you weren't gone,

01:51:54.131 --> 01:51:55.630
a dead man for ten years.

01:51:55.632 --> 01:51:57.599
I'm not trying to
get back in your life, Heather.

01:51:57.601 --> 01:52:00.335
I'm just trying to help you out.

01:52:00.337 --> 01:52:02.370
I'm not. I think you're
misunderstanding me.

01:52:02.372 --> 01:52:04.372
I'm not
misunderstanding anything.

01:52:04.374 --> 01:52:06.675
I had to create
another life, Frank.

01:52:06.677 --> 01:52:08.945
I, I had to have stability
for the children.

01:52:08.947 --> 01:52:10.412
- What was I supposed to do?
- I know.

01:52:10.414 --> 01:52:12.815
I married Briggs,
and he treated us terribly,

01:52:12.817 --> 01:52:15.083
but at least there was stability
and food on the table,

01:52:15.085 --> 01:52:16.351
and a roof over our heads.

01:52:16.353 --> 01:52:19.089
So please forgive me
if I'm a little bit hostile.

01:52:25.596 --> 01:52:26.630
Did he hit you?

01:52:29.233 --> 01:52:30.665
He provided for us.

01:52:30.667 --> 01:52:34.302
He put a, a roof over our heads
and food on the table.

01:52:34.304 --> 01:52:36.273
That ain't what I'm asking you.

01:52:37.441 --> 01:52:38.475
Did he hit you?

01:52:42.145 --> 01:52:44.546
Heather, did he hit you?

01:52:44.548 --> 01:52:47.150
Frank, I just want to go
see my children, please.

01:52:53.190 --> 01:52:55.023
I ain't letting him
get away with that.

01:52:55.025 --> 01:52:57.027
What are you gonna do?

01:52:59.931 --> 01:53:01.998
Why are we stopped?

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.331
I want to see my children!

01:53:03.333 --> 01:53:05.567
No, we're going back
to the Compound.

01:53:05.569 --> 01:53:08.203
- What are you talking about?
- We're going to the Compound.

01:53:08.205 --> 01:53:10.305
I'm not letting that man
get away with that.

01:53:10.307 --> 01:53:11.606
What, we're going
to see Briggs?

01:53:11.608 --> 01:53:13.375
- No, no, I wanna go see...
- Yup.

01:53:13.377 --> 01:53:14.509
I want to go
see my children!

01:53:14.511 --> 01:53:16.111
We'll get you
to your children afterwards,

01:53:16.113 --> 01:53:18.148
but this is gonna end
here and now.

01:53:19.216 --> 01:53:20.883
Come on.

01:53:20.885 --> 01:53:22.117
Frank!

01:54:37.962 --> 01:54:39.363
Captain McCalister.

01:54:40.597 --> 01:54:41.563
Back so soon.

01:54:41.565 --> 01:54:43.431
Cut the shit, Briggs.

01:54:43.433 --> 01:54:46.334
After your last little threat,

01:54:46.336 --> 01:54:48.336
one of my men
did an inquiry into you

01:54:48.338 --> 01:54:50.305
and found out some
interesting information

01:54:50.307 --> 01:54:53.475
about you and your
little operation here.

01:54:53.477 --> 01:54:54.777
Let me stop you right there

01:54:54.779 --> 01:54:56.544
before you go too far
and embarrass yourself.

01:54:56.546 --> 01:55:00.883
Mr. Briggs, it is time for you
to stop with the lies,

01:55:00.885 --> 01:55:03.119
and stop with the stories.

01:55:03.121 --> 01:55:07.422
Now, I don't know
how you rose to your position,

01:55:07.424 --> 01:55:09.925
although I have my theories.

01:55:09.927 --> 01:55:13.328
But aside from that,
you are hereby under arrest

01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:16.164
for multiple infractions
of the law.

01:55:16.166 --> 01:55:20.568
Firstly, for selling
US government firearms

01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:22.205
to the hostiles!

01:55:24.641 --> 01:55:25.742
Arrest him.

01:55:26.978 --> 01:55:28.343
I don't think so!

01:55:33.216 --> 01:55:34.651
You best just back off.

01:55:36.253 --> 01:55:37.922
Go on,
holster your weapons.

01:55:40.457 --> 01:55:42.058
Or I will shoot and kill

01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.726
your sweet, dear
Captain McCalister.

01:55:44.728 --> 01:55:47.364
Are you sure this is
the right thing to do?

01:55:48.465 --> 01:55:50.732
You can't walk away from this.

01:55:50.734 --> 01:55:53.401
I could do whatever
the hell I damn well please,

01:55:53.403 --> 01:55:54.569
and I believe you are
in no position

01:55:54.571 --> 01:55:56.705
to be making demands of me!

01:56:02.345 --> 01:56:04.847
What the hell
are you doin', Briggs?

01:56:04.849 --> 01:56:07.584
Remember that faction
I was telling you about, boys?

01:56:09.686 --> 01:56:10.687
Here it is.

01:56:12.924 --> 01:56:14.990
But, Briggs, sir.

01:56:14.992 --> 01:56:18.493
That's Captain McCalister,
you can't, you can't do this.

01:56:18.495 --> 01:56:21.329
Sir, you shoot him,

01:56:21.331 --> 01:56:22.597
the whole operation
goes to hell.

01:56:22.599 --> 01:56:24.767
Yeah, well, I'm doing it, boys.

01:56:27.738 --> 01:56:29.439
And now for my demands.

01:56:31.241 --> 01:56:33.274
Firstly, I want
guaranteed safe passage

01:56:33.276 --> 01:56:34.509
south of the border to Mexico

01:56:34.511 --> 01:56:36.580
where my compadres
will pick me up.

01:56:37.614 --> 01:56:39.115
And, secondly,
I would rather have

01:56:39.117 --> 01:56:41.817
to not deal with this fool!

01:56:41.819 --> 01:56:43.451
Now would you both
please get out there

01:56:43.453 --> 01:56:45.687
and do me the privilege
of finding Connor!

01:56:45.689 --> 01:56:47.288
As soon as Frank Connor
gets here,

01:56:47.290 --> 01:56:49.326
I will make the exchange.

01:56:52.096 --> 01:56:54.864
Then I suppose
in the meantime...

01:56:54.866 --> 01:56:57.835
Captain McCalister and I
will just wait patiently.

01:57:03.207 --> 01:57:05.540
What a country.

01:57:05.542 --> 01:57:09.577
A farm boy like me
can rise to such high power!

01:57:09.579 --> 01:57:11.883
To be operating
such a major operation.

01:57:14.252 --> 01:57:15.953
And the best part is,

01:57:17.354 --> 01:57:19.422
none of ya ever questioned me.

01:57:24.829 --> 01:57:29.466
Which is exactly why
I'm the stud duck in this pond.

01:57:30.034 --> 01:57:31.434
Shoot him.

01:57:36.439 --> 01:57:37.741
Not bad, huh?

01:57:41.879 --> 01:57:44.679
Now while all of you
are gonna be working hard

01:57:44.681 --> 01:57:45.881
trying to get the bad guys,

01:57:45.883 --> 01:57:48.017
I'm gonna be sittin' pretty
in Mexico,

01:57:48.019 --> 01:57:51.352
making sweet, sweet love
to some sexy señoritas

01:57:51.354 --> 01:57:53.356
and fandango-ing the night away.

01:57:55.525 --> 01:57:57.893
Cat got your tongue,
Captain McCalister?

01:58:07.939 --> 01:58:11.841
Sir, I highly recommend
you think twice about this.

01:58:11.843 --> 01:58:14.709
Please, think about
everything you worked for.

01:58:14.711 --> 01:58:16.912
It's not the way to do this.

01:58:16.914 --> 01:58:18.580
Sir, please.

01:58:22.286 --> 01:58:24.220
No, you get the hell
out of my way.

01:58:24.222 --> 01:58:25.955
- Damn it, Briggs!
- No!

01:58:25.957 --> 01:58:27.923
Get back, all of you!

01:58:27.925 --> 01:58:30.491
This is my camp, and I want you
to get the hell out of here!

01:58:30.493 --> 01:58:32.360
Briggs, calm down.

01:58:32.362 --> 01:58:34.129
Now, Feldman, you listen up!

01:58:34.131 --> 01:58:35.264
As soon as Frank Connor
gets here,

01:58:35.266 --> 01:58:37.032
I want his hands
tied behind his back.

01:58:37.034 --> 01:58:39.134
I want my horse ready to go!

01:58:43.707 --> 01:58:45.709
And then I will make
the exchange.

01:58:53.317 --> 01:58:54.551
Well?

01:58:57.088 --> 01:58:58.488
How's that feel?

01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:03.160
One of your men dead,

01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:06.864
another done run off.

01:59:08.498 --> 01:59:09.967
You feelin' lonely?

01:59:13.337 --> 01:59:15.505
How does it happen, Mr. Briggs?

01:59:17.741 --> 01:59:21.145
How does a farm boy
from Valdosta, Georgia,

01:59:22.545 --> 01:59:26.984
become... this?

01:59:29.153 --> 01:59:31.488
A disgrace to our country.

01:59:33.523 --> 01:59:34.926
It's pathetic.

01:59:53.077 --> 01:59:55.844
I got a bad feeling
about this.

01:59:55.846 --> 01:59:57.714
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:59:59.850 --> 02:00:01.850
Why don't you run
into that brush and hide.

02:00:01.852 --> 02:00:03.955
Don't be scared,
I'll be back for you.

02:00:04.755 --> 02:00:06.757
Well, let me off the horse.

02:00:14.098 --> 02:00:15.199
Well, okay, then.

02:00:41.425 --> 02:00:42.490
You see what I see?

02:00:42.492 --> 02:00:43.759
Hold up,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00:43.761 --> 02:00:45.863
Yes, yes. Hold, hold,
hold, hold, hold.

02:00:48.531 --> 02:00:50.034
Mr. Connor!

02:00:50.633 --> 02:00:52.633
What's going on?

02:00:52.635 --> 02:00:54.203
Well,
it appears Briggs

02:00:54.205 --> 02:00:55.806
is looking for a dog to kick.

02:00:56.740 --> 02:00:59.475
He's got Captain McCalister
hostage.

02:00:59.477 --> 02:01:01.711
He wants to switch him out
with you.

02:01:06.083 --> 02:01:08.986
Y'all mind if I take care
of some personal business?

02:01:13.391 --> 02:01:15.893
Be our guest.
We're done.

02:01:16.894 --> 02:01:18.661
He's all yours, Connor.

02:01:20.898 --> 02:01:21.932
Come on.

02:01:49.692 --> 02:01:51.860
All you sons of bitches!

02:01:51.862 --> 02:01:54.229
- Get down, Connor!
- What the hell are you doing?

02:01:54.231 --> 02:01:56.465
You're gonna get
yourself killed!

02:01:56.467 --> 02:01:58.599
If you weren't
wearing that uniform,

02:01:58.601 --> 02:02:00.202
I'd swear to God
you're protecting them.

02:02:00.204 --> 02:02:02.271
Now get up there
and start shootin'!

02:02:02.273 --> 02:02:03.806
That's just like you, Frank.

02:02:03.808 --> 02:02:05.140
Before you go into a canyon,

02:02:05.142 --> 02:02:07.178
you should know how
the hell you get out.

02:02:08.512 --> 02:02:10.781
So that's what this
is all about, huh?

02:02:12.850 --> 02:02:15.086
Go on, you kill yourself.

02:02:57.394 --> 02:02:58.395
Hi, Frank.

02:03:02.867 --> 02:03:04.701
Nice of you to join us.

02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:26.257
Show me you're not carrying
a packing iron.

02:03:37.468 --> 02:03:38.668
All right.

02:03:51.048 --> 02:03:52.781
Henry, why don't you let
that Captain go

02:03:52.783 --> 02:03:54.950
and you can have me.

02:03:54.952 --> 02:03:57.021
Come on, Frank.
You know me better than that.

02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:01.158
Why would I let him go?

02:04:02.893 --> 02:04:04.995
Henry, you listen to me now.

02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:08.032
You let that Captain go.

02:04:08.766 --> 02:04:10.234
It's between you and me.

02:04:12.136 --> 02:04:14.071
But I don't
want you, Frank.

02:04:20.444 --> 02:04:21.779
I want to kill you.

02:04:27.585 --> 02:04:29.019
Travis!

02:04:32.856 --> 02:04:34.058
What's this?

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:38.827
An apparition of my dead wife?

02:04:38.829 --> 02:04:41.729
What the hell's
going on, Travis?

02:04:41.731 --> 02:04:43.065
Where are you,
what are you doing?

02:04:43.067 --> 02:04:45.302
You know this ain't gonna lead
to nowhere good.

02:04:46.237 --> 02:04:48.138
You can let
the Captain go, please.

02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:52.409
Frank, she never loved you.

02:04:54.311 --> 02:04:56.413
You done deserted her
a decade ago.

02:04:58.649 --> 02:05:00.084
Matter of fact...

02:05:04.088 --> 02:05:06.190
She don't give a crap about you.

02:05:11.295 --> 02:05:12.427
Travis.

02:05:12.429 --> 02:05:16.732
You can end all of this
right here, right now.

02:05:16.734 --> 02:05:18.700
You can end it all.

02:05:18.702 --> 02:05:20.204
Please, just stop.

02:05:21.472 --> 02:05:23.372
Let him go.

02:05:35.052 --> 02:05:36.351
Heather.

02:05:42.393 --> 02:05:43.827
Do you love me?

02:05:47.097 --> 02:05:48.832
Of course, I love you.

02:05:50.567 --> 02:05:52.303
You're my husband.

02:05:53.337 --> 02:05:54.505
You hear that, Frank?

02:05:58.075 --> 02:05:59.543
So run away with me.

02:06:02.313 --> 02:06:04.148
We'll go
someplace nice.

02:06:06.583 --> 02:06:07.985
And the children?

02:06:09.820 --> 02:06:12.556
Sure.
I'll send for 'em later.

02:06:14.325 --> 02:06:19.330
We'll live happily on top
of a mountain somewhere.

02:06:20.297 --> 02:06:21.565
Oh, on a mountain.

02:06:32.376 --> 02:06:34.343
Okay.

02:06:34.345 --> 02:06:36.313
We'll send
for the children later.

02:06:37.848 --> 02:06:39.216
Later.

02:06:40.417 --> 02:06:43.753
And maybe
there will be a river...

02:06:43.755 --> 02:06:45.222
near the mountain.

02:06:49.993 --> 02:06:51.560
I like that.

02:06:51.562 --> 02:06:55.165
So you can just
let the Captain go.

02:06:57.534 --> 02:06:58.635
I'm all yours.

02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:03.640
As a Captain in the US Army...

02:07:05.075 --> 02:07:07.411
I now sentence you to die.

02:07:09.079 --> 02:07:12.116
Heather!

02:08:00.497 --> 02:08:01.565
You're gonna be okay.

02:08:02.566 --> 02:08:03.634
Frank.

02:08:06.336 --> 02:08:07.538
Listen to me.

02:08:12.777 --> 02:08:14.378
I forgive you.

02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:18.848
I'm so sorry.

02:08:36.333 --> 02:08:38.066
You're gonna be okay, all right?

02:08:38.068 --> 02:08:40.204
And be strong for me.

02:08:41.104 --> 02:08:42.537
Can you do that for me?

02:08:42.539 --> 02:08:44.241
Yeah.

02:08:50.949 --> 02:08:53.883
Harrison, you used to be
an army surgeon, right?

02:08:53.885 --> 02:08:55.517
I've mined some lead before.

02:08:55.519 --> 02:08:57.087
It's been a while, kid.

02:09:00.357 --> 02:09:02.390
It's gonna be all right. Hey.

02:09:02.392 --> 02:09:04.628
Hey. It's gonna be all right.

02:09:06.063 --> 02:09:09.066
I need you to be strong
for me, all right, baby?

02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:16.106
Frank. Do us both a favor
and go outside.

02:09:46.603 --> 02:09:48.238
Now, missy.

02:09:48.907 --> 02:09:51.106
You're gonna be okay.

02:09:51.108 --> 02:09:52.942
I'm gonna make
a little incision,

02:09:52.944 --> 02:09:54.743
and then I'm gonna dig
for that bullet.

02:09:54.745 --> 02:09:58.348
Now it's gonna be a pain
you've never felt before.

02:10:00.584 --> 02:10:02.752
Hang on.

02:10:18.068 --> 02:10:20.571
You did good.
You'll be okay.

02:10:42.927 --> 02:10:44.894
Hey.

02:10:44.896 --> 02:10:46.730
Is Ma gonna be all right?

02:10:49.901 --> 02:10:54.336
Uh, she's recovered,
but she got hurt real bad.

02:10:54.338 --> 02:10:57.105
And, uh... Well, Harrison?

02:10:57.107 --> 02:10:58.508
Is she all right?

02:11:05.850 --> 02:11:08.350
She lost a lot of blood,
but I patched her up.

02:11:08.352 --> 02:11:10.251
She's strong, she'll be okay.

02:11:10.253 --> 02:11:12.922
- When can we see her?
- Soon.

02:11:12.924 --> 02:11:17.762
But remember, you need your mom,
but your mom needs you.

02:11:20.197 --> 02:11:22.163
Harrison!
Get over here.

02:11:22.165 --> 02:11:23.367
Excuse me.

02:11:26.603 --> 02:11:28.238
Grandpa
told us everything.

02:11:29.073 --> 02:11:31.341
Yeah, Paw.

02:11:49.626 --> 02:11:51.994
Why don't you two go pick
your momma some flowers, huh?

02:11:51.996 --> 02:11:53.261
I'm sure she'd like that.

02:11:53.263 --> 02:11:54.631
- Go on and get.
- Yeah.

02:12:31.501 --> 02:12:34.204
Hey, kids, I got
something outside for ya.

02:12:43.848 --> 02:12:44.914
Really, is she mine?

02:12:44.916 --> 02:12:46.548
She's yours
and your brother's.

02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:48.316
- She's mine too?
- Yup.

02:12:48.318 --> 02:12:50.418
Oh, my gosh!

02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:53.989
- Wow! She's so cute!
- Oh, she's so cute!

02:12:53.991 --> 02:12:54.890
Aw!

02:12:54.892 --> 02:12:57.492
- Can't wait to ride her.
- She's soft too!

02:12:57.494 --> 02:12:59.327
All right,
who's gonna ride her first?

02:12:59.329 --> 02:13:00.562
I think I want
to ride her,

02:13:00.564 --> 02:13:01.766
but I think I'd be too big.

02:13:03.935 --> 02:13:05.835
Aw.

02:13:05.837 --> 02:13:07.435
Yeah, go on ahead. Hop on.

02:13:07.437 --> 02:13:08.570
I want
to ride her first, sis.

02:13:08.572 --> 02:13:11.639
Here, Ethan, get on it.
Oh, she's so sweet!

02:13:11.641 --> 02:13:14.009
You gotta put
more effort into it.

02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:21.817
Wow. It's way different
from being on a normal horse.

02:13:21.819 --> 02:13:24.586
It's just a bit lower.

02:13:24.588 --> 02:13:26.387
- All right.
- You gotta be careful with it.

02:13:26.389 --> 02:13:28.356
Come on, come on.

02:13:28.358 --> 02:13:30.291
- Yeah, just tug her along.
- Come on.

02:13:30.293 --> 02:13:31.726
- Just gently guide it.
- Gently.

02:13:31.728 --> 02:13:34.562
- Come on.
- We love all God's creatures.

02:13:34.564 --> 02:13:35.865
Be nice.

02:13:46.543 --> 02:13:47.777
Look at that.

02:13:47.779 --> 02:13:50.747
You ever seen something
so pretty in all your life?

02:13:52.649 --> 02:13:54.752
I missed you, Frank Connor.

02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:57.021
Hm.

02:14:00.958 --> 02:14:03.393
I never want to leave you
ever again.

02:14:04.162 --> 02:14:05.662
Well, then, don't.
