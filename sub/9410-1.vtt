One moment, please.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.667
Someone by the name of Judith.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.800
[ Chattering ]

14:45.800 --> 14:48.300
Sam! Over here.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.300
How do you like it?
I made it just for you.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.800
It's good.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.300
- And how do you like this?
- Great.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.200
It's just like yours.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.533
Come on, ladies.
We've got a lot of work to do!

15:01.533 --> 15:03.867
Sam? Judith?

15:03.867 --> 15:06.767
What are you waiting for?
Hustle up now.

15:08.967 --> 15:12.333
Oh, here.
Let me get you a clean uniform.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.667
Hello.
It doesn't matter what Byrd wears.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.033
She's a walking catastrophe.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.400
And what have you done
with your hair?

15:22.400 --> 15:25.433
Don't you love it?
It's just like Sam's!

15:25.433 --> 15:27.033
Anybody home?

15:28.567 --> 15:31.000
- [ All ] Defense!
- Can you help me?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.167
- [ Coach ] The other way.
- Me, help you?

15:34.167 --> 15:37.000
You're a natural.
Show me how you do it.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.500
[ Coach ]
Shake it out. All right.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Okay. Sure.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.000
Get low!

15:42.500 --> 15:43.833
- [ Girls Shouts ]
- To this side.

15:45.067 --> 15:49.000
The other way.
That's it, that's it.

15:49.500 --> 15:53.000
Tough break.
That's how I want to learn to shoot.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.200
[ Coach ]
Good. Back!

15:55.200 --> 15:57.133
[ Girls ]
Defense!

15:57.633 --> 15:59.633
[ Man On PA, Indistinct ]

15:59.633 --> 16:03.633
- What are you gonna have?
- I don't know. What are you gonna have?

16:03.633 --> 16:06.133
Whatever you have.
You have such great taste.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.633
[ Chattering ]

16:09.633 --> 16:12.133
And maybe on the weekend,
we can go shopping.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.533
I mean, you have to tell me
where you get your shoes.

16:16.033 --> 16:18.233
They're just your basic shoes.

16:18.233 --> 16:20.133
But I love the color.

16:20.133 --> 16:22.133
Yeah. Basic black.

16:22.133 --> 16:25.267
Have you ever noticed how Sam
has the coolest colored pencils?

16:25.267 --> 16:27.400
I was just going to say.

16:27.833 --> 16:31.867
She can do so much with
your eight basic colors.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.267
- Sam, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

16:35.267 --> 16:38.267
- Alone.
- Oh, hey, sure.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.900
Uh, listen, Sam.
I'll talk to you later.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.400
Maybe we can study
together tonight?

16:42.900 --> 16:45.633
Uh, I think I'll be busy.
Sorry.

16:45.633 --> 16:47.633
That's cool.
Whatever.

16:48.133 --> 16:48.853
Later.

16:52.633 --> 16:55.000
- What's going on?
- What's up with her?

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
You wouldn't believe it.
It's m-- my--

16:59.000 --> 17:00.867
It must have been something I said.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.933
Ugh.
It feels like something I ate.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.633
Well, what do I do?

17:07.133 --> 17:11.133
Well, if your old worst enemy
is your new best friend,

17:11.133 --> 17:13.067
shouldn't you be happier?

17:17.700 --> 17:19.700
[ Rewinding, Beeps ]

17:19.700 --> 17:21.200
Hi, Sam. It's Judith.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.200
You're not in,
so I guess I'll call you later.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.700
Hi! It's Judith again!
Call me when you get in.

17:26.700 --> 17:30.200
Hey, where are you? It's Judith.
Call me.  - [ Phone Rings ]

17:30.200 --> 17:32.933
[ On Tape ]
Hi. It's Judith. I'll call you later.

17:33.367 --> 17:35.867
- [ Ringing ]
- Sam, it's Judith. I hope you're okay.

17:41.867 --> 17:43.800
[ Sighs ]

17:45.200 --> 17:47.200
[ Clicks ]

17:49.200 --> 17:52.833
- [ Gasps ]
- Shh! It's just me, Judith.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.500
What--
What are you doing here?

17:55.500 --> 17:58.000
I snuck in and hid in your closet.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.467
- What, are you nuts?
- You said we could study together later.

18:00.467 --> 18:03.467
Not tonight.
It's way too late!

18:03.467 --> 18:05.467
[ Mom ] Sam?
Are you talking on the phone?

18:05.467 --> 18:07.033
No, Mom. It's okay.

18:07.533 --> 18:10.033
You know you're not allowed
on the phone after lights out.

18:10.033 --> 18:11.967
Yeah.
Good night, Mom.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.233
I just love your room.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.667
- These sheets are so cool.
- Shut up!

18:19.167 --> 18:20.167
You have to be completely quiet

18:20.167 --> 18:22.467
until I can find a way
to get you out of here.

18:22.467 --> 18:25.600
- [ Whispers ] Sorry.
- [ Sighs ]

18:25.600 --> 18:30.100
[ Man On TV ] The forecast:
mostly sunny skies today.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.067
Bye, Mom.
I'll see you after school.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.567
- [ Mom ] Have a good day, dear.
- Hi!

18:34.567 --> 18:36.567
[ Groans ]

18:36.567 --> 18:38.067
I thought maybe we could
walk to school together.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.067
No!

18:40.567 --> 18:43.533
Sam! Wait! What's the matter?
I thought we were best friends!

18:48.033 --> 18:49.533
Short cut.

18:49.533 --> 18:52.967
- Stop bothering me!
- What do you mean?

18:52.967 --> 18:55.300
- [ Bird Cawing ]
- [ Whooshing ]

18:56.767 --> 18:58.167
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

18:58.167 --> 18:59.900
- Oh. Uh--
- You!

18:59.900 --> 19:04.800
I know. I know, I know.
You're still unhappy.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.233
Your wishes have ruined my life!

19:07.233 --> 19:09.033
- Hello, everyone.
- [ Clarissa ] Oh!

19:09.033 --> 19:11.767
I don't want you to be unhappy.

19:11.767 --> 19:15.167
I was only trying
to repay your kindness.

19:15.167 --> 19:18.567
- I wish I'd never met you.
- What are you guys talking about?

19:18.567 --> 19:21.067
If that is what you desire,

19:21.067 --> 19:24.000
I will cancel your last wish
and give you another chance.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.900
- Sam, you know the most interesting people.
- It is my desire.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.533
Then make your wish.
[ Inhales ]

19:32.533 --> 19:34.900
Here's my wish.
I wish I'd never met you.

19:37.267 --> 19:40.700
- Is that your wish?
- N-No. Here's my full wish.

19:42.700 --> 19:47.167
- I wish I-- Get lost.
- Isn't she the greatest?

19:47.167 --> 19:49.733
I wish I'd never met you.

19:49.733 --> 19:52.767
I wish you'd met Judith instead.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.200
So, you know what
you're gonna wish for?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
What are you doing here, Byrd?

20:26.200 --> 20:29.900
- Lose your compass on your migration?
- She's back.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.067
If you don't mind, I'm trying to
have a private conversation here.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.333
- Oh, sure.
- [ Huffs ]

20:41.600 --> 20:43.600
I wish...

20:43.600 --> 20:47.200
that wherever I was, people would
gather around and admire me.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.200
Oh.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.733
Oh, look. How beautiful.
