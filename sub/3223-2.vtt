WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:06.445
Where's the road?

00:07.080 --> 00:09.651
You're freaking alive.
What the hell happened?

00:09.840 --> 00:13.640
Standing too close to exploding Dick
sends your ass straight to Purgatory.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.331
You were in Purgatory?
How'd you get out?

00:23.200 --> 00:25.328
What? No thanks for saving your hide?

00:25.520 --> 00:27.568
- I got something you need.
- What's that?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.161
- A way out.
- What's in it for you?

00:30.360 --> 00:32.647
I'm hopping a ride. We made it, brother.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.451
- I can't believe it.
- You and me both.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.490
- What about Cass? Was he there?
- Yeah, Cass didn't make it.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.168
Cass, I think we better go. Cass?

00:43.360 --> 00:45.727
- So Cass is dead? You saw him die?
- I saw enough.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.126
Don't wanna be a prophet.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.210
He was our responsibility.
You didn't answer the damn phone.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.205
Let's find him.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.241
The king of hell just snapped
my girlfriend's neck.

00:55.440 --> 00:58.091
Crowley kidnapped you, I saw that.
But then you escaped.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.607
- How?
- There was a tablet.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.690
- There's another tablet?
- Did this tablet have a name?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.211
- Demons.
- What about demons?

01:05.400 --> 01:09.405
Banish all demons off the face of
the earth, lock them away forever.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.047
So sorry to have kept you waiting,
Mr. Vili.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.369
It's just it's been so long
since you checked in with us...

01:23.600 --> 01:26.001
...we had to dig through our archives.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.329
Don't worry about me, dear.
I've got plenty of time.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.131
- Which box is it again?
- One.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.844
I'm sorry, did you say "one"?

01:36.040 --> 01:39.647
- As in Box Number 1?
- If memory serves.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.724
During our last renovation,
we had to replace the safe boxes...

01:51.960 --> 01:54.964
...and we put yours inside a new one.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.524
Ah.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.806
I'm sorry, sir...

02:19.320 --> 02:22.324
...but is that a bone?

02:22.520 --> 02:28.323
Not just any bone, my dear,
an extremely valuable one.

02:30.520 --> 02:35.651
Well, I'm happy we were able to
keep it safe for you all these years.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.640
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

02:39.200 --> 02:43.728
Why, yes. Now that I think about it.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.684
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.251
Hmm.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.329
Are you kidding me? You're kidding me.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.763
What? Is it too much to ask if we can
swing by and check on my mom?

03:06.960 --> 03:10.442
Swing by? It's a day's drive
in the opposite direction.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.005
You know that, right?

03:12.200 --> 03:15.170
- I understand we're in a hurry.
- Okay, then what's the problem?

03:15.360 --> 03:18.523
Channing's broken neck is my problem.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.962
As in I'd rather not see my mom
twisted into a corkscrew.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.482
- Kid's got a point, Dean.
- Stay out of this. Kevin, your mom is fine.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.202
- How could you possibly know that?
- Because Crowley needs her to be.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.844
Okay? He's probably got the place stacked
with bodyguards right now protecting her...

03:36.040 --> 03:38.691
...so that when you show up,
they'll pounce on you both.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.121
Is that supposed to make me
feel better?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.044
She's bait, man, plain and simple...

03:43.280 --> 03:46.124
...and you wanna swim right up
and bite the hook?

03:49.200 --> 03:52.568
Look, we have got Crowley
by the short and curlies.

03:52.760 --> 03:56.651
Okay? All we need to do is find the tablet,
whip up the spell and boom.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.281
Sunshine and sandy beaches.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.891
Dean. My mom's all alone.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.606
She's surrounded by demons.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.607
Can you really not understand
why I wanna make sure she's okay?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.207
Son of a bitch.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.284
Fine, let's go.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.121
- Tiger Mom, 9:00.
- Where?

04:36.320 --> 04:37.810
Left window.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.282
She seems okay.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.922
Sad but okay.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.803
Check out the mailman.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.571
Yeah, that's Carl. So what?

05:07.040 --> 05:11.170
Yeah, well, Carl's filled your mom's mailbox
three times since we've been sitting here.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.771
He's a demon?

05:12.960 --> 05:18.569
You see the gardener?
Think that plant needs any more water?

06:08.880 --> 06:11.963
He'll be back. You just have to believe.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.288
Thanks, Eunis.

06:14.480 --> 06:19.042
And I do believe.
I just wish I could do more.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.730
Linda, you're doing all you should
by staying here.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.844
He needs to know he has a home
to come back to.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.280
Hi, Mom.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.441
Kevin. Kevin.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.285
- What...?
- She's clean.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.921
You smell that?

07:11.080 --> 07:13.082
Eunis!

07:13.320 --> 07:15.448
That's not Eunis.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.851
Mrs. Tran, your friend
was possessed by a demon.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.605
Have you ever seen The Exorcist?

07:26.440 --> 07:30.490
Is that what you've been doing all year?
Watching television?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.441
Did you really have to kill her?

07:36.240 --> 07:39.801
The demon would have warned Crowley
where Kevin was if we didn't.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.802
And Crowley is the one
who kidnapped you?

07:43.000 --> 07:48.245
Yeah. He needs me to translate his stupid
tablet so he can take over the universe.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.280
We need to get it so we can slam the gates
of hell forever with Crowley inside.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.529
So that things like that
don't ever happen again.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.443
Prophet of the Lord, huh?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.480
That does have a nice ring to it.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.601
I'll get packed.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.444
We'll need a safe house
since Crowley's been to the cabin.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.291
Safe house?
I thought we were going to get the tablet.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.287
We are. You're taking a trip
to a demon-free zone.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.848
And risk letting Kevin fall into
the hands of this Crowley again?

08:22.040 --> 08:25.442
- I don't think so.
- Ms. Tran, all due respect, Dean's right.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.440
Crowley, he's not just a killer,
he trades in torment.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.120
If he can find a way to separate
your soul from you...

08:32.360 --> 08:36.649
...he'll take that soul to hell and roast it
till there's nothing left but black smoke.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.606
- Look, it's best if you let us handle this.
- I understand.

08:40.799 --> 08:45.203
But it's not my soul I'm worried about,
it's my son's.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.884
Kevin, you wanna back us up here?

08:50.080 --> 08:54.529
Came all the way here to pull her out of the
fire. Now she wants to jump right back in.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.006
Like I can tell her what to do.

09:06.920 --> 09:11.130
All right. Coming with us has conditions. Uh,
hex bags to stay off the bad guys' radar.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.046
And, uh, you're gonna have to get inked up.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.683
- Do what now?
- Yeah, uh, ahem.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.723
You too, shortstop.

09:23.400 --> 09:26.324
- It keeps the demons out.
- Fine.

09:26.520 --> 09:31.560
- Really?
- What, like it's my first tattoo?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.884
You smell it, Sammy?

09:57.080 --> 09:59.401
- Burning flesh?
- Revenge.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.170
So close.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.445
Hey, how'd you do
that reverse exorcism thing?

10:07.960 --> 10:09.724
Just said the verse backwards.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.928
So place is clean, far as I can tell.

10:33.080 --> 10:36.641
All right. Positive thoughts.

10:51.960 --> 10:56.329
- You hid the Word of God in a diaper bag?
- No.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.489
Shut up.

11:15.640 --> 11:20.009
Been nothing but trouble with these lockers.
Got broke into near every day for a while.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.811
Could never figure out who it was
till yesterday.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.490
- So you know who did it?
- Sure.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.445
It was Clem Smedley,
a guy who worked the desk before me.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.244
Tell me he's at county right now.

11:29.440 --> 11:33.126
- Yup. Waiting for arraignment.
- Thanks.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.164
Should have known they'd plant
a Lo.Jack in one of them bags.

11:36.360 --> 11:40.729
Sharp guy, that Jerry.
He'll be a fine replacement for me.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.320
Right.

11:42.520 --> 11:46.366
Well, in one of those lockers,
there was a tablet.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.840
Do you know where it is?

11:51.520 --> 11:54.171
Can I even acknowledge that
without my lawyer here?

11:55.720 --> 12:00.851
Uh, look, I'm sure we can work out a little,
uh, something-something with the locals...

12:01.040 --> 12:02.804
...if you just cooperate.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.243
What kind of something-something?

12:15.720 --> 12:17.688
I don't think he knows, man.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.604
Leniency.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.771
Oh, he knows.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.481
Where's the angel?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.004
So here's what I'm thinking.
Full immunity...

12:33.200 --> 12:36.921
...from all charges,
both past, present and future.

12:44.520 --> 12:49.242
- Hey. Dean, come on.
- You feel that?

12:51.920 --> 12:55.367
- There's a stream.
- Go on.

12:55.560 --> 12:58.086
It runs through a clearing
not far from here.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.123
I'll show you.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.962
How about you just tell me?

13:07.560 --> 13:10.404
Hey. Dean!

13:10.640 --> 13:13.371
Pawn shop, First and Main.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.647
Go on.

13:16.160 --> 13:22.088
Three days journey. Follow the stream.
There's a clearing.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.803
You'll find your angel there.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.164
You know what, mutt?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.691
I believe you.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.721
Dean.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.084
Come on.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.967
Whoa.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.850
Hey.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.683
Hello, sir. Agents Neil and Sixx, FBI.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.002
Uh, we're looking for a tablet.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.329
About, uh, yay big,
got some hieroglyphic crap on it.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.285
Sold to you by a thief named Clem.
Ring a bell?

14:30.480 --> 14:32.130
Nope.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.047
Hey, Lyle?

14:34.240 --> 14:37.926
I've had a really, really bad day today
so I'm not in the mood to dillydally.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.488
If you wanna do this the rough way,
I am happy to oblige.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.890
Sure. We could do it that way,
if you wanna get famous.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.720
- That your car outside?
- What's it to you, mail-order?

14:52.920 --> 14:55.730
- Hey! Pal.
- I got it.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.323
I notice you're driving with expired tags.
Maybe because you acquired it in a trade.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.171
I'm guessing that means
you haven't registered it yet...

15:03.360 --> 15:06.489
...which means you haven't paid the tax.
Is that correct?

15:06.680 --> 15:07.966
None of your business.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.525
Kevin, average Blue Book
on a 2010 Ferrari F430 Spider?

15:12.760 --> 15:16.731
- Two hundred and seventeen thousand.
- And the 5 percent Wyoming tax?

15:16.920 --> 15:18.684
Ten thousand eight hundred fifty.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.571
Ten thousand dollars.

15:22.760 --> 15:26.924
Something tells me you're the type
who might balk at a tax bill that big.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.963
- What is this? An FBI audit?
- No.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.761
But my brother, who happens to work for
the Wyoming tax assessor's office...

15:34.960 --> 15:39.443
...could arrange that if he thought
something untoward was happening here.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.246
So, what's it going to be? The tablet...

15:45.440 --> 15:47.966
...or that piece of Euro trash crap
you call a car?

16:01.840 --> 16:05.208
- You sure this is the right place?
- It's what the pawn slip says.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.811
Kevin?

16:09.200 --> 16:11.123
- Who wants to know?
- Oh, relax, Dean.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.966
I'm not going to steal your prophet.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.766
Mm.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.450
Ah.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.122
And you must be Kevin's mother.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.528
Beau, and it is my absolute pleasure.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.248
And, uh, Kevin, imagine my luck.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.845
Here I was working so hard
looking for you that...

16:37.040 --> 16:39.771
...I never stopped to think
you might be looking for me.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.169
- I have something for you.
- What is it?

16:43.800 --> 16:48.169
An invitation, dear man,
to a very exclusive auction.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.963
Let me guess,
where you'll be selling the tablet.

16:52.160 --> 16:55.209
Well, when we acquire an item
as hot as the Word of God...

16:55.400 --> 16:58.449
...it's smart to unload it
as fast as possible.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.281
And we are in such desperate need
of a headliner for tonight's gala.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.565
I hope you have three extra tickets to your
eBay party because the prophet's with us.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.286
If you're worried about
the safety of the prophet...

17:09.880 --> 17:13.281
...rest assured that we have
a strict no-casting, no-cursing...

17:13.480 --> 17:18.008
..."no supernaturally flicking the two of you
against the wall just for the fun of it" policy.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.170
Is that right? How'd you manage that?

17:21.359 --> 17:23.521
Well, I am the right hand of a god,
after all.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.281
- Plutus, specifically.
- Hmph. Is that even a planet anymore?

17:30.040 --> 17:31.371
He's the god of greed.

17:31.560 --> 17:37.010
And my liege has warded these premises
against hell, heaven and beyond.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.527
Quite necessary with
some of the players we see.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.805
And incidentally,
quite possibly the safest place...

17:44.040 --> 17:46.088
...your precious prophet could be.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.486
Well, since time is of the essence,
perhaps I'll just go ahead...

17:51.680 --> 17:55.048
...and add a plus-three
to the prophet's invitation.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.443
Copacetic?

18:01.400 --> 18:04.051
Well, thank you, Mr. Peanut!

18:05.880 --> 18:09.487
All right, what do we have to bid?

18:11.600 --> 18:13.045
We can't show up empty-handed.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.720
All we have to our name
is a few hacked gold cards.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.605
All right, well, then
we're gonna have to get creative.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.971
Huh.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.609
- Well...
- No.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.969
Say it and I will kill you,
your children and your grandchildren.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.447
Okay, okay. Uh...

18:33.720 --> 18:36.371
Wait a second.
These auctions, they display...

18:36.560 --> 18:39.564
- ...the items to the bidders beforehand?
- Yeah, so?

18:39.800 --> 18:43.361
So all we gotta do is get Kevin
close enough to memorize the spell.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.682
What do you think,
think you can swing it?

18:45.880 --> 18:47.166
Of course he can swing it...

18:47.360 --> 18:50.489
...if the bumper stickers
on my Previa mean anything.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.602
He didn't mean it, baby.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.444
Now, now, Dean.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.650
The system only works
when everyone participates.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.161
I'll be back for this.

19:55.240 --> 20:00.087
- How are we supposed to know who's who?
- It's pretty simple. They're all monsters.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.363
Hey. Hey.!-

20:08.560 --> 20:11.006
- Great.
- Guess we're not as original as we thought.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.170
It's okay. It's okay.
We just gotta come up with a Plan B.

20:14.360 --> 20:18.729
And what, pray tell,
could possibly have been Plan A?

20:18.960 --> 20:22.521
Bring the prophet to the most dangerous
place, memorize the tablet...

20:22.720 --> 20:25.883
...and then vamoose?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.562
Hello, boys.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.486
Crowley.

20:39.240 --> 20:42.403
Kevin, what a pleasure to see you.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.400
Sorry about your little play date.
Her name...

20:48.400 --> 20:51.722
You're gonna make an omelet,
sometimes you have to break some spines.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.322
And who is this lovely young thing?
Must be your sister.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.085
Stay away from my son.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.565
Charming.

21:01.760 --> 21:06.209
Defiling her corpse has just made
number one on my to-do list. Ah-ah-ah.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.368
Don't mind a love tap
but anything more...

21:08.560 --> 21:11.564
...and our pals may throw you out,
and that would be a shame.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.922
He's right, Dean. It's not worth it.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.569
Listen to moose, squirrel.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.326
Ah.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.931
Here comes our host.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.923
- Honored guests, please find your seats.
- That's Plutus?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.646
What is he, God of the candy aisle?

21:30.960 --> 21:33.440
Gentlemen, the auction is starting.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.804
Good luck with the bidding.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.089
Nice right hook.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.968
Dean Winchester?

21:45.280 --> 21:49.205
- Do I know you?
- No, but, uh, I knew Castiel.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.847
You're an angel?

21:52.160 --> 21:56.449
This was the nearest vessel, short notice. Don't
usually come to things like this but, uh...

21:56.640 --> 21:59.644
- You're chasing the magic rock.
- We protect the Word of God.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.407
Well, awesome job so far, uh, Alfie.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.807
Actually, my name is Samandriel.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.490
Let's just stick with Alfie.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.643
I wanted to ask you about Castiel.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.168
What happened to him?

22:14.720 --> 22:17.246
Well, me and Cass...

22:17.480 --> 22:22.486
...we, uh, iced Dick Roman and got a one-way
rocket ride to Purgatory for our trouble.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.082
But you escaped. Did Castiel?

22:31.880 --> 22:37.171
You know, there are some in heaven
who still believe...

22:37.360 --> 22:40.409
...despite his mistakes...

22:40.600 --> 22:43.206
...that Castiel's heart
was always in the right place.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.482
Are you one of them?

22:46.680 --> 22:51.402
I think too much heart
was always Castiel's problem.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.571
Cass?

23:21.080 --> 23:22.684
Dean.

23:27.680 --> 23:28.966
Cass.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.881
Damn, it's good to see you.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.242
- Nice peach fuzz.
- Thank you.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.366
I want you to meet somebody.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.045
This is Benny. Benny, this is Cass.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.045
How did you find me?

23:47.240 --> 23:48.765
The bloody way.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.291
You feeling okay?

23:50.920 --> 23:52.763
You mean am I still...

23:53.920 --> 23:57.561
- If you wanna be on the nose about it, sure.
- No, I'm perfectly sane.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.242
But then 94 percent of psychotics
think they're perfectly sane.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.966
So I guess we'd have to ask ourselves,
what is sane?

24:05.280 --> 24:06.361
Yeah, good question.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.324
- Why'd you bail on Dean?
- Dude.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.924
The way I hear it, you
two hit monsterland...

24:12.120 --> 24:14.043
...and hot wings here took off.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.004
I figure he owes you some back-story.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.601
Look, we were surrounded, okay?

24:18.800 --> 24:21.963
Some freak jumped Cass.
Obviously, he kicked its ass. Right?

24:23.120 --> 24:24.724
No.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.965
What?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.330
I ran away.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.647
You ran away?

24:33.760 --> 24:35.330
I had to.

24:35.960 --> 24:38.440
That's your excuse for leaving me
with those wolves?

24:38.640 --> 24:41.086
- Dean.
- You bailed out and what...

24:41.280 --> 24:42.361
...went camping?

24:43.240 --> 24:45.607
I prayed to you, Cass. Every night.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.243
- I know.
- You know? And you didn't...

24:50.360 --> 24:53.443
- What's wrong with you?
- I am an angel in a land of abominations.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.450
There have been things hunting me
from the moment we arrived.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.808
- Join the club!
- These are not just monsters.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.047
They're Leviathan.

25:00.240 --> 25:04.962
I have a price on my head and I've been
trying to stay one step ahead of them...

25:06.240 --> 25:08.242
...to keep them away from you.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.009
That's why I ran.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.840
Just leave me, please.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.203
- Sounds like a plan. Let's roll.
- Hold on, hold on.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.850
Cass...

25:24.760 --> 25:26.569
...we're getting out of here.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.841
We're going home.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.324
- Dean, I can't.
- You can.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.363
Benny, tell him.

25:32.880 --> 25:37.681
Purgatory has an escape hatch,
but I got no idea if it's angel-friendly.

25:37.880 --> 25:42.329
Hey, we'll figure it out.
Cass, buddy, I need you.

25:44.280 --> 25:45.327
Dean.

25:45.560 --> 25:49.690
And if Leviathan wanna take a shot at us,
let them.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.804
We ganked those bitches once before.
We can do it again.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.845
It's too dangerous.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.649
Let me bottom-line it for you.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.888
I'm not leaving here without you.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.326
Understand?

26:04.840 --> 26:06.683
I understand.

26:17.240 --> 26:21.040
Ladies, gentlemen and other...

26:22.040 --> 26:25.362
...welcome to this
once in a lifetime event.

26:26.440 --> 26:28.249
Samandriel.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.891
Slumming it, are we?

26:30.080 --> 26:34.404
...The first name in magical
and alchemical esoterica.

26:34.600 --> 26:38.730
Our prices may be high,
but our quality is unmatched.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.283
And we stand by our product.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.450
Don't know why you're so keen
on that hunk of dirt.

26:44.640 --> 26:48.247
So it tells you how to blast back
a few demons. I'll just make more.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.411
You can't get rid of all
of my black-eyed boys, Samantha.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.405
Yeah, we'll see.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.249
So how much we got for Plan B?

26:59.440 --> 27:01.807
Well, we got our hacked credit cards...

27:02.000 --> 27:05.447
...about $2,000
and a, uh, Costco membership.

27:05.680 --> 27:10.242
Our first item, the Amulet of Hesperus.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.446
Let's start the bidding with, um,
three tons of dwarven gold.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.484
Ah, this lady.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.489
I have three. Do I have, uh, four?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.603
Ah. Four. Gentleman here.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.451
Four going for five. Five?

27:24.920 --> 27:26.922
Five to this lady.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.288
- Do we have an advance on five tons?
- Plan C?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.005
- Big time.
- Any other bids?

27:31.640 --> 27:34.086
- Any other bids?
- I'm gonna use the restroom.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.167
Sold.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.649
Thank you.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.210
This isn't the men's room.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.764
Okay.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.689
Our next item up for bid,
the hammer of Thor.

28:47.880 --> 28:52.124
- Mjölnir.
- A finger bone from the frost giant Ymir.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.967
Uh...

28:59.160 --> 29:03.563
The bone and, uh, five-eighths of a virgin.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.125
Mm.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.084
Sold.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.163
- Plan C tanked.
- Maybe you should try Plan D, for dumb-ass.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.847
Our next lot, the Word of God.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.087
Capital G.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.926
Very old. Very rare.

29:26.440 --> 29:29.603
Three billion dollars.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.931
Whoa.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.641
The Mona Lisa.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.284
The real Mona Lisa, where she's topless.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.601
Vatican City.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.087
Alaska.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.128
Palin and a bridge to nowhere?
No thanks.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.290
All right, the moon.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.048
- You're bidding the moon?
- Yeah.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.401
Claimed it for hell.

29:55.640 --> 29:59.690
You think a man named Buzz gets to
go into space without making a deal?

29:59.960 --> 30:03.760
Ah. I'm sorry, it seems that
our reserve price has not been met.

30:03.960 --> 30:08.363
So in order to stimulate the bidding,
we're going to add an item to this lot.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.924
Kevin Tran, Prophet of the Lord.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.364
No!

30:17.320 --> 30:20.369
Mr. Tran is the only person on Earth
who can read this tablet...

30:20.560 --> 30:24.007
- ...which makes them a perfect matching set.
- So out of your league.

30:25.320 --> 30:29.325
- So do I hear a bid of, um...?
- No, stop!

30:29.680 --> 30:31.284
I'll give you whatever you want.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.290
I have a 401 k, my house.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.366
Good effort, Ms. Tran...

30:38.600 --> 30:41.843
...but I'm afraid this is
a little out of your price range.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.521
- My soul.
- Mom, don't!

30:46.600 --> 30:48.489
I bid my soul.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.809
- Are you sure? That's a big move.
- Interesting.

30:52.640 --> 30:56.804
If it's souls that you're after,
I can give you a million souls.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.042
Hey, flyboy, you gonna get in on this?

30:59.240 --> 31:01.641
We guard the souls in heaven,
we don't trade them.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.202
- So we have a deal?
- It's not about the quantity, chief.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.641
It's about the sacrifice.

31:08.360 --> 31:12.968
This little lady's soul
is the most valuable thing she has.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.889
It's everything.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.925
Are you willing to offer everything,
Mr. Crowley?

31:20.520 --> 31:22.124
Tick-tock.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.166
Fine, you win.

31:26.400 --> 31:31.008
I bid my own soul.

31:37.160 --> 31:41.404
Mr. Crowley, you don't have a soul.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.169
Congrats, sweetheart.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.807
Thank you. Thank you.

32:07.440 --> 32:11.490
Losing my soul, is it going to hurt?

32:12.280 --> 32:13.725
Probably.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.967
- Will I die?
- No.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.249
You'll just wish you were dead.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.244
Okay.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.124
It's time.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.251
You all right?

32:40.840 --> 32:44.640
Yeah, can I just have a minute?

32:47.160 --> 32:48.571
Dean, this sucks.

32:48.760 --> 32:53.368
We're about to close the gates of hell
forever. You ask me, we got off cheap.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.203
Excuse me, miss?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.562
Hi, my name's Sam...

33:08.080 --> 33:10.321
Alfie. I'm an angel.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.568
Who works at Wiener Hut?

33:12.800 --> 33:16.088
No, this is, uh... It doesn't matter.

33:16.280 --> 33:19.090
What you did in here was amazing.

33:19.280 --> 33:22.284
I want you to know that my friends
and I can protect your son.

33:22.840 --> 33:29.405
The Winchesters are exceptional men,
but they're just men.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.002
- If Kevin comes with us then...
- Oh, no, no.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.610
The last time that angels
tried to help my son...

33:36.800 --> 33:38.643
...I watched them die...

33:38.840 --> 33:42.128
...and Kevin went missing for a year.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.924
So no offense...

33:44.440 --> 33:48.684
...but I'm gonna take my chances
with them.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.726
Mm. Mjölnir, I've missed you.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.121
Where's the kid?

34:06.720 --> 34:09.768
- What are you gonna do with her soul?
- Whatever I want.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.565
I might sell it...

34:12.400 --> 34:17.201
...or maybe I'll just tuck it away
with my other precious objects.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.449
Let them keep me warm at night. Mm.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.764
Whenever you're ready, dear.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.364
Wait.

34:40.760 --> 34:42.922
Hello, boys.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.324
Crowley?

34:51.239 --> 34:52.286
No.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.248
You can't. My warding spells.

34:54.480 --> 34:58.451
Your girl Friday
showed me a few loopholes.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.529
No offense, but I'm going
to take my chances with them.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.043
- Ah.
- Now that was very, very stupid.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.091
And all it cost me
was an island in the South Pacific.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.408
I love a bargain.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.849
Can't do all my tricks,
but I can do enough.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.121
Get out of her!

35:37.960 --> 35:41.089
If I had a nickel for every time
someone's screamed that at me...

35:47.680 --> 35:50.047
Getting in touch with
your feminine side, huh, Crowley?

35:50.240 --> 35:51.730
Something like that.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.005
Well, come and get him.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.889
One out of two ain't bad.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.126
Watch the kid.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.846
Kevin, don't. Let Dean take care of it.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.451
Sam, move!

36:23.040 --> 36:24.087
BEAU Don't.

36:25.840 --> 36:28.684
You know what's better
than one private island?

36:29.360 --> 36:31.840
Two private islands.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.766
Okay, give it back.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.809
Give it back.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.011
Where'd you get
the five-eighths of a virgin?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.084
Oh, no.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.651
Mom!

37:32.600 --> 37:34.648
Well, that was exciting.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.603
Good luck closing the gates to hell...

37:42.440 --> 37:44.090
...without this. Heh.

37:45.040 --> 37:49.409
Surprising what Mommy dearest
has rattling around in her head.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.841
Wanna know who your real father is?

37:53.120 --> 37:55.282
- Scandalous.
- Crowley.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.124
I know we're not mates, Kevin...

38:00.600 --> 38:02.364
...but one word of advice:

38:02.560 --> 38:03.607
Run.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.366
Run far and run fast.

38:06.560 --> 38:11.600
Because the Winchesters, well,
they have a habit of using people up...

38:11.800 --> 38:14.007
...and watching them die bloody.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.283
Toodles.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.563
Has she said anything?

38:46.560 --> 38:50.007
Listen, Kev.
What your mom went through, it's hell.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.009
Trust me, I know.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.844
But she seems tough.
She'll pull it together.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.122
You tried to kill her.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.881
- Kid, in this life...
- Shut up.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.488
I don't wanna hear any more
of your crappy speeches.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.041
I just wanna talk to my mom.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.646
Alone.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.486
Sure.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.049
Five minutes.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.604
Mom.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.922
Dean, were you really going to, uh...?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.521
What, slit soccer mom's throat?

39:47.440 --> 39:49.442
Yeah, I was. Wish I had.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.526
- Dean...
- It was Crowley, Sam.

39:53.720 --> 39:57.167
Doesn't matter what meat suit he's in.
I should've knifed him.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.686
Yeah, it would've sucked
and I would've hated myself...

40:01.880 --> 40:03.928
...but what's one more nightmare, right?

40:09.960 --> 40:12.088
Does it seem a little quiet in there
to you?

40:16.520 --> 40:18.204
Kevin?

40:20.800 --> 40:22.609
Kevin?

40:24.240 --> 40:26.481
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.762
- Hey.
- What?

40:33.120 --> 40:34.724
What's it say?

40:36.200 --> 40:40.603
Uh, they bolted, we shouldn't come looking.
Since we lost the tablet...

40:40.800 --> 40:43.531
- ...Kevin figures we don't need him.
- Crowley still does.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.768
What's that kid thinking?

40:46.600 --> 40:49.922
He thinks people I don't need anymore,
they end up dead.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.404
Dean, that's not true. You know that.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.730
Dean.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.241
Dean! Aah!

41:04.600 --> 41:05.647
Dean.
