07:56.601 --> 07:58.561
Filburt was so attached
to that bird.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.229
He left it
for us to care for

09:06.837 --> 09:09.674
Oh, Filburt, I'm sorry.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.800
Maybe next time.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.718
Aah, whatever.

09:12.802 --> 09:17.348
Now, where's
my precious Turdy?

09:19.058 --> 09:21.644
Should I sit down?

09:21.727 --> 09:22.979
Yes.

{\an1}Filburt, um...
this is...

09:25.189 --> 09:25.856
(<i> chuckles nervously</i> )

09:25.940 --> 09:28.276
{\an1}This is very hard
for me to say.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.569
The bird is dead, isn't it?

09:30.653 --> 09:31.821
Eh...

09:31.904 --> 09:33.823
Yes.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.200
Oh, Rocko.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.286
Now, Fil, please...

09:38.369 --> 09:40.329
{\an5}I should have
said something
before I left.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.873
Turdy belonged
to a species

09:42.957 --> 09:44.542
known as
<i>Tirdius minimus,</i>

09:44.625 --> 09:48.170
{\an1}a rare subfamily of mynah with
only a three-week life-span.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.424
I'm surprised he lived
as long as he did.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.927
Sure, he was like family,
and I'm going to miss that,

09:55.011 --> 09:55.511
but life goes on.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.722
But, Filburt, you see...

09:57.805 --> 10:00.057
Don't worry
about it.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.143
{\an1}Did you tell him
I sat on it?

10:04.645 --> 10:06.939
FILBURT:
I'm so glad we did this.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.359
Turdy always told me
he wanted to be buried at sky.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.119
Now I think
it would be a good idea

10:20.202 --> 10:22.872
if we all said something.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.373
{\an3}Heffer?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.043
Would you like
to say something?

10:27.126 --> 10:28.294
Um...

10:28.377 --> 10:30.129
Beans, beans,
they're good for your heart

10:30.212 --> 10:31.130
The more you eat...

10:31.213 --> 10:32.548
All right,
that's enough.

10:32.631 --> 10:34.050
Rocko?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.885
{\an1}Would you like
to say a few words?

10:35.968 --> 10:36.552
Um, yes.

Okay, my turn.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.700
Turdy, bless you.

10:59.784 --> 11:03.412
Even though you were with us
for a brief time,

11:03.496 --> 11:08.793
you still had plenty of time
to spread happiness.

11:08.876 --> 11:09.877
(<i> sighs</i> )

11:13.881 --> 11:15.091
Let's get some tacos.

I've got a whole family.

11:59.176 --> 12:02.179
Thank you, Turdy.

12:05.224 --> 12:10.479
And now my first Sunday frolic
with my new family.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.606
Could you give me a push,
Hutch, honey?

12:12.690 --> 12:14.942
You got it, turtledove.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.362
I'm nauseous.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.072
I'm nauseous.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.532

12:47.475 --> 12:50.561
{\an1}Great race last week

12:50.644 --> 12:53.772
{\an1}Too bad your car exploded
in the third turn.

12:53.856 --> 12:54.940
{\an3}Yeah.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.776
{\an5}Where do you think
Teddy's family
is living now?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.403
Aren't you guys
a little too old

12:59.487 --> 13:01.113
to still be
in the Weasel Scouts?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.657
{\an1}It's a way
of life, Rocko.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.035
Yeah, but for 12 years?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.204
That's enough

And next week we'll have
our meeting at Paul's house.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.575
{\an1}I'm a failure,
Filburt.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.036
{\an1}Nobody in the scouts
likes me.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.663
{\an1}I can't do
anything right.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.248
{\an3}Yeah.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.334
You're probably
right.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.755
But trust me, you're
senior-weasel material.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.798
They just
don't know it.

15:24.882 --> 15:25.924

17:53.405 --> 17:55.491
You don't think
it's too gross?

17:55.574 --> 17:56.658
What's too gross?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.577
{\an1}Come on, Rocko,

20:25.265 --> 20:27.601
{\an1}Why don't you just grow up
and be an adult?

20:27.684 --> 20:29.561
A freak?

20:34.858 --> 20:36.735
You guys go ahead without me.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.654
But we're going
to Astro Camp.

20:38.737 --> 20:45.661
I'm not going to another scout

20:45.744 --> 20:48.121
Good-bye.

21:01.593 --> 21:05.389
Okay, who wants to blow up
the next satellite?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.299
(<i> crash</i> )

21:41.383 --> 21:43.093
What the...?!

21:46.054 --> 21:46.304
Ma!

21:48.807 --> 21:50.684
Yes, dear.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.894
There's a... a...

21:52.978 --> 21:55.063
There's a bunch
of Weasel Scouts...

21:55.147 --> 21:57.858
WEASELS:
♪ All we are saying ♪

21:57.941 --> 22:02.195
♪ Is give Hef a chance. ♪

22:05.198 --> 22:06.908
Go away.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.493
Go to your homes.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.621
I will be your freak no more.

22:13.540 --> 22:17.002
{\an1}This Heffer belching thing
is getting out of hand.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.795
Hmm.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.214
I seem to remember
a certain someone

22:21.298 --> 22:23.592
who had a few peculiar traits
of his own.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.927
Huh?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.476
(<i> someone makes farting sound</i> )

22:32.559 --> 22:33.685
(<i> makes farting sound</i> )

22:33.769 --> 22:35.937
(<i> giggles</i> )

22:36.021 --> 22:38.774
Oh, of course
I'll marry you.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.610
(<i> sniffles</i> )

22:43.862 --> 22:46.615
(<i> sobbing and sniffling</i> )

22:46.698 --> 22:49.910
{\an1}Son...

22:49.993 --> 22:51.661
(<i> snorts</i> )

22:51.745 --> 22:53.914
{\an1}I... came up here
to apologize.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.124
{\an1}I... I...

22:56.208 --> 22:56.958
I overreacted.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.295
(<i> sniffles</i> )

23:00.378 --> 23:00.796
{\an1}I, uh...

23:00.879 --> 23:03.048
just wanted to say

23:03.131 --> 23:06.802
{\an1}that you're always somebody
in this household,

23:06.885 --> 23:09.429
even if you're nobody.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.307
This belch thing's
okay for now, but...

23:12.390 --> 23:15.477
I want you to grow up to be
something better than that.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.145
You got it?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.855
Okay, Dad.

23:18.939 --> 23:19.981
There's one more thing.

23:20.065 --> 23:24.986
It's, um... it's difficult
for me to talk about.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.073
Let me put it this way.

23:28.156 --> 23:29.533
(<i> makes farting sound</i> )

23:32.577 --> 23:33.537
(<i> chuckles</i> )

23:33.620 --> 23:38.125
(<i> both laughing boisterously</i> )

23:40.335 --> 23:43.088
Weasels!

23:43.171 --> 23:46.091
(<i> belching</i> ):
Give me a merit badge now!

23:46.174 --> 23:49.845
WEASELS (<i> cheering</i> ):
Yay! Hooray!

23:49.928 --> 23:51.763
Huh?

23:51.847 --> 23:53.140
Look.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.185
{\an5}WEASEL:
Quick, weasels,
a citizen in need!

23:57.269 --> 24:00.397
(<i> excitedly</i> ):
Lady, here we come!

24:00.480 --> 24:02.274
Weasels are
on the job!
