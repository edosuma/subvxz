00:01.401 --> 00:03.198
NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.269 --> 00:06.898
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.973 --> 00:08.064
In New York City,

00:08.141 --> 00:10.871
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.943 --> 00:14.710
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.781 --> 00:16.544
These are their stories,

00:18.818 --> 00:21.116
SIoop on the end
is nice, huh?

00:21.187 --> 00:23.587
It's not a sloop,
it's a ketch.

00:23.656 --> 00:26.318
No, it's a sloop.
I've been pricing them.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.954
Union win some
monumental hike in rookie pay
I didn't hear about?

00:30.030 --> 00:32.362
Hey, never too soon
to plan for retirement.

00:32.432 --> 00:33.524
Retirement?

00:33.600 --> 00:36.091
What makes you think you pass
the six-month review?

00:36.169 --> 00:37.158
(CHUCKLES)

00:38.171 --> 00:39.536
(SHIP HORN BLARING)

00:40.073 --> 00:42.735
Sir, everything
all right?

00:45.845 --> 00:48.040
I need to see
your marina pass.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.177
We got a runner.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.378
Oh! Hey!
Stop!

00:53.453 --> 00:55.216
Police!
20, Frank to Central.

00:55.288 --> 00:59.520
Pick up on a suspicious male
fleeing on foot
inside Riverside Park.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.619
Hey, get back here!
Stop!

01:10.036 --> 01:11.401
Oh, damn it.

01:11.471 --> 01:15.100
On the ground!
Face down, hands
on the back of your head.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.802
Hey, Josh, can you
help me here?
I got him.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.639
Yeah. I got something
over here, too.

01:23.216 --> 01:25.776
We got IDs?
No wallet on the guy.

01:25.852 --> 01:28.218
Woman was stripped naked,
no sign of her clothes.

01:28.288 --> 01:31.689
They were sexually positioned
after death.
This rock our weapon?

01:31.758 --> 01:34.522
We don't know
where that fits in.
We're Iooking for a knife.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.061
BIitz attack
or they put up a fight?

01:36.129 --> 01:39.428
Defensive wounds on the guy.
The woman, we can't say.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.160
Hands are missing.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.361
So is the head.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.200
We're searching
the area, ma'am.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.796
(SIREN WAILING)
Officer Dorsey.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.866
Like I was telling
your partner, our collar
might Iook good for it.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.138
Tossed a bag in the water.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.873
Big enough to hold
the missing parts.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.744
My partner's got him
in our car.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.375
He talking?
We called in
for an interpreter.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.579
I speak a Iittle Spanish
and French. I can Mirandize
in three others.

02:01.654 --> 02:03.588
What is he?
Deaf.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074

02:52.572 --> 02:54.540
You have the right
to an attorney.

02:54.607 --> 02:57.440
You have the right to have
an attorney present
during questioning.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.841
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

02:58.912 --> 03:01.881
one will be provided for you
free of charge.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.813
It's also on this card.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.650
BENSON: Do you understand
your rights, Scotty?

03:06.719 --> 03:08.846
I'm deaf, not dumb.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.023
I don't need a Iawyer.
I didn't do anything.

03:13.293 --> 03:16.888
Well, good.
What were you doing
on the docks?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.867
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.303
You always run from police
when you go on your walks?

03:27.507 --> 03:31.273
AII I saw was the Iight
they blinded me with.
I was scared, so I ran.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.404
So fast that you dropped
your bag in the river.

03:36.182 --> 03:40.209
It was weighing me down.
Well, body parts
can get heavy.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.982
So what happened here?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.857
I had nothing to do
with this. I don't know
what you're trying to pull.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.801
I am not involved
with this.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.838
So what was in your bag?

04:02.575 --> 04:03.564
(EXHALES)

04:05.345 --> 04:08.178
We recovered
the duffel bag downstream.
With the head and hands?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.910
Stolen goods.
Two high-end Iaptops
and some jewelry.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.679
From?
A burgled houseboat.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.242
Right about where
they first spotted Scotty.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.048
PIenty of prints.
We're running them now.

04:16.122 --> 04:19.113
Boat by any chance
missing its owners?
Both alive and pissed.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.753
They didn't take out
extended warranties
on the computers.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.996
(SIGHING)

04:26.532 --> 04:29.763
How's it going?
(CLEARS THROAT)
It's not adding up.

04:29.836 --> 04:33.101
There's no way
he came out of that bloodbath
without a drop on him.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.366
What's on his rap sheet?

04:34.440 --> 04:38.001
Larceny, marijuana possession.
No assaults.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.479
What do you want to do?
Hand him off to burglary.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.984
But Iet's check around
the deaf community, see if
he's missing any enemies.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.644
Or a girlfriend.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.886
Where are we
with missing persons?

04:51.958 --> 04:53.550
Having trouble
filling in the blanks

04:53.626 --> 04:56.561
Iike height, hair color,
eye color.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.462
That was probably the point.
No fingerprints
or dental records.

04:59.532 --> 05:02.660
Why hers, not his?
Perp's connection
was to her.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.464
Maybe he has
a sexual fetishism.

05:04.537 --> 05:07.097
Kemper had a whole closet
full of heads.
No hands.

05:07.173 --> 05:10.700
Cannibalism?
No, you'd go
for the fleshier parts.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.211
AII right, all right.
Enough theories,
I want facts.

05:13.279 --> 05:17.409
The more we know
about the victims,
the clearer motive becomes.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.145
Male was in his mid 50s.
Female in her early 40s.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.552
Aside from her obvious
head and hand wounds,

05:23.623 --> 05:26.990
both suffered deep,
jagged stab wounds
to the midsection.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.084
What kind of knife
we talking?

05:28.161 --> 05:31.062
KARLAN: Major-duty hunting
with a sharp,
8-inch serrated blade.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.724
Got a nasty head Iaceration.
We got a bloody rock.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.236
No. I found
embedded tree bark.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.804
Might have been hit
with a hefty branch.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.840
Results in from
the rape kit?
Spermicide.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.071
But his pants were open,
had Iipstick on him.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.136
So she was doing
the male victim,
perp happened upon them,

05:48.214 --> 05:51.741
killed him, took his place,
killed her when he was done.

05:51.818 --> 05:54.753
He's got a wedding ring.
This a married couple?

05:55.488 --> 05:58.013
Trust me, married couples
don't have sex in parks.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.524
Maybe he picked up a pro.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.719
I don't find
too many working girls
who make it to 40

06:01.794 --> 06:03.887
without any evidence
of cervical dysplasia.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.988
Mistress?
They didn't party together.

06:06.065 --> 06:08.898
John Doe here had
a blood alcohol Ievel of.17.

06:08.968 --> 06:13.029
She didn't have a trace.
Opposites attract.
Any hit on his prints?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.130
No.

06:15.007 --> 06:19.273
But pacemaker companies
are required to keep records
on all patients.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.473
As much as I'd Iike
to help out,

06:24.550 --> 06:28.145
Celadyne Industries puts
great stock in our customers'
right to privacy.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.916
And yet you spend
so much Iess on R and D
than your competitors.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.582
FDA had a Iittle problem
with that, didn't they?

06:32.658 --> 06:34.785
That was a voluntary recall.

06:35.795 --> 06:39.196
Celadyne's L wires
had a tendency to fracture
mid-pulse,

06:39.265 --> 06:42.530
piercing recipients
through the heart.
That's just wrong.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.661
We have since made
significant design
improvements

06:44.737 --> 06:49.333
to our dual-chamber
pulse generators,
but we can only do so much.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.436
We can't make people
take their meds or refrain
from risky behaviors.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.538
MUNCH: Our guy
got himself stabbed.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.448
That's hardly
a product malfunction.

06:58.518 --> 07:02.750
Can't rule it out
as a contributing factor
without a special inquiry.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.417
(EXHALES)

07:06.959 --> 07:08.517
(PUNCHING KEYS)

07:11.297 --> 07:13.060
Edward Boggs.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.461
Mrs. Boggs,
when was the Iast time
you saw your husband?

07:19.839 --> 07:21.704
When he was
Ieaving for work.

07:21.774 --> 07:25.733
What time was that?
4:00. He works
the night shift.

07:26.913 --> 07:31.350
Do you know why he would have
been in Riverside Park
between 7:00 and 10:00?

07:31.417 --> 07:34.978
No. That doesn't
make sense. No.

07:35.054 --> 07:38.990
He worked
at the reclamation plant
on Randall's Island.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.425
We're still trying
to piece together
all the details.

07:42.829 --> 07:46.526
He did, however,
have a high Ievel of alcohol
in his blood.

07:47.533 --> 07:50.559
That's impossible.
Edward doesn't drink anymore.

07:52.038 --> 07:56.304
Mrs. Boggs, was your husband
having an affair?

07:57.777 --> 08:00.644
(SOBBING)
No. Why would you ask that?

08:01.681 --> 08:04.514
BENSON: Another victim
was also found in the park.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.446
A woman.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.448
A woman?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.958
She's good.
She's in shock.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.458
Housewife.
Completely dependent.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.758
Suspects he's cheating,
follows him, catches him
in the act, see ya.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.594
You really think
meek Mindy here could
blitz attack two people?

08:20.666 --> 08:22.463
You don't need pecs
to hire a killer.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.799
Find out what else
Ed Iied to the missus about.

08:24.871 --> 08:29.570
Recanvass the park, bars,
Iiquor stores, anything within
staggering distance.

08:34.212 --> 08:36.113
CANDY: Yeah. I know him.
Whiskey, straight up.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.047
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Been in every night
the Iast two weeks.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.778
He friendly with
any of the customers?

08:39.852 --> 08:43.082
Not until Thursday.
Then he hooks up
with one of the regulars.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.988
You know her name?
His. Vinnie. Scum.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.919
What'd they talk about?
Women.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.762
Vinnie was all,
"Bitches this, bitches that,"
every time I walk by.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.929
They Ieave together?
After the game, about 9:00.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.064
Anything else?
I got ice cubes melting.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.866
Trouble at home,
stress at the job.

09:04.944 --> 09:08.175
Ed goes out to the bars
to unwind and rag
on the old Iady.

09:08.247 --> 09:12.445
Enter Vinnie.
They start pounding them back,
stories get heated.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.884
We've been Iooking at Ed
as only a victim.

09:14.954 --> 09:18.151
Maybe he and Vinnie run into
the woman on the street
and wolf-pack her.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.752
Ed's down for the rape
but not the murder. He freaks,
Vinnie takes him out.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.421
Hey, you got
a Vinnie up there.
Is that our guy?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.261
Yeah, chronic Ioser.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.934
Does he play
the weekly pool, too?

09:31.003 --> 09:33.494
Never picks more than
three winners a week.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.942
My Iabrador does better
than that.
Today's his Iucky day.

09:39.679 --> 09:43.274
You know, this is entrapment.
I'm a victim
of a sting operation.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.715
I'm here under...
False pretenses?

09:45.785 --> 09:46.979
False arrest.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.850
Hey, man, you're not even
under arrest, yet,

09:48.921 --> 09:51.481
so why don't you just
settle down and tell us
about your friend Ed?

09:51.557 --> 09:54.993
Hey, screw you.
I can screw you harder.

09:55.061 --> 09:58.053
See, we have this handy Iittle
Iaw enforcement
tool that allows us

09:58.130 --> 10:00.963
to throw
suspicious people Iike you
in jail for 24 hours.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.660
So why don't we
try this again?

10:02.735 --> 10:05.966
Look, I got this job.
I can't mess up, all right?

10:06.038 --> 10:07.972
They're gonna fire me
if I don't show.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.837
So tell us about
your night with Ed.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.900
We had a conversation.
Is that a crime?

10:11.978 --> 10:14.970
BENSON: It depends.
What did you two talk about?

10:15.047 --> 10:16.309
Bitches.

10:16.849 --> 10:20.580
Guy had this female boss.
Real ball-buster, you know?

10:20.653 --> 10:25.056
And about two weeks ago,
fires his ass
for no reason whatsoever.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.421
That must have pissed him off.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.722
He was crying in his whiskey
when I found him.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.558
So you join him
and you stoke up
the fires there?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.725
I spent the better part
of the night reinflating
the guy's gonads.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.858
Now he wants revenge,

10:35.935 --> 10:39.268
so you two start
talking about bitches
to take it out on.

10:39.338 --> 10:42.330
He didn't even have the stones
to go home and tell
his old Iady he'd been fired.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.569
Pretended to go to work
every day.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.839
That's why he was Ioading up
on Iiquid courage,

10:46.912 --> 10:49.972
to go home and confess.
But you had a different plan.

10:50.049 --> 10:53.212
Yeah, another bar.
You know, pick up some broads.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.945
But he turned me down flat,
so we parted company.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.253
Now, where would this
have been?
Riverside.

10:59.892 --> 11:01.655
Where I caught a taxi.

11:01.727 --> 11:05.663
Which way did Ed go?
Ed went into the park.
Nature called.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.539
Female victim
was attacked here,

11:15.074 --> 11:17.269
dragged over to this spot
where she's butchered.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.312
She's then sexually positioned
with the male victim

11:20.379 --> 11:23.007
who bled out right here.
One perp, two victims.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.549
FIN: Look at this.

11:24.984 --> 11:29.444
Now, I'm no park ranger,
but since when did trees
bleed red sap?

11:30.322 --> 11:32.119
ME found bark
in Ed's forehead.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.216
Footprints are pointing
toward the tree.

11:34.293 --> 11:38.753
Run a urine analysis
on that bark. I bet you'd find
Ed's DNA about waist high.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.992
Vinnie said
that nature called.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.592
So he had
no connection whatsoever
to the female victim?

11:43.669 --> 11:45.296
Okay, new theory.

11:45.771 --> 11:49.764
Perp rapes her,
starts dismemberment.
He hears a twig snap.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.173
Sneaks up behind Ed,

11:51.243 --> 11:54.508
smashes his head
into the trunk right there.
No witness.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.605
Explains why his pants
were open.
Wait a minute.

11:57.683 --> 12:01.619
The ME said he found
the female victim's Iipstick
on Boggs.

12:01.687 --> 12:02.984
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Perp's screwing with us.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.456
He staged that relationship
to throw us off track.

12:06.525 --> 12:08.959
Benson.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.461
Yeah, right.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.794
Sewer worker in Brooklyn
just found the remains
of a hand.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.970
You mind slipping this on?

12:28.514 --> 12:31.244
Why?
I need it to hold form.

12:31.317 --> 12:35.378
Thumbs have to be
similar in size, or we'II get
distorted results.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.186
Too manly.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.258
TREVOR: It's been through hell
and back. Submerged
for at Ieast 20 hours,

12:44.330 --> 12:47.128
after which rats made
a picnic out of it.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.466
I'II run her through
the system.

12:49.535 --> 12:53.494
Let's just hope
she's an ex-con, teacher
or otherwise bonded.

13:00.179 --> 13:01.976
I passed the poly.

13:03.315 --> 13:06.648
Get him out of here.
What, no apology?

13:07.119 --> 13:09.485
We got a hit
on the thumbprint.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.013
Who?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.989
Special Agent Pam Tilden.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.027
FBI?
MFPCA.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.529
Manhattan's Humane
Law Enforcement.
STABLER: The dog police.

13:18.597 --> 13:21.760
Yeah, she investigated people
who tortured
and abused animals.

13:21.834 --> 13:26.430
Future wife beaters,
child abusers.
And serial killers.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.167
(DOG BARKING)
OKEL: You think Pam
knew her killer?

13:32.244 --> 13:34.405
Lengths taken
to hide her identity,
it's a good bet.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.641
Was she having any trouble
in her personal Iife?

13:36.715 --> 13:38.876
Not that I know of.
Boyfriend?

13:38.951 --> 13:41.146
Pam was married to the job.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.519
Here she is.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.319
She was with us seven years.
BENSON: She worked out
in the field?

13:46.392 --> 13:49.054
There are five million animals
in this city
and just fourteen of us.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.390
We all work the field.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.556
She work on any case recently
that might have
put her at risk?

13:53.632 --> 13:56.294
We don't carry firearms
for the fashion statement.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.734
You never know
what's on the other side
of the door.

13:58.804 --> 14:01.466
We're gonna need a copy
of those case files.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.770
Well, who do we sweat first,
granny with 65 cats

14:03.876 --> 14:07.676
or the SoHo poodle poisoner?
Well, here's the Iast case
she closed.

14:07.746 --> 14:10.738
This guy Jake moves into
his father's basement
with his new bride, Missy.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.977
Father walks in on them
on their wedding night.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.283
How is that animal cruelty?
Missy's a German shepherd.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.619
That's perfectly Iegal
in 26 states.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.319
Jake argued it wasn't
bestiality, where the animal
is often hurt,

14:21.393 --> 14:24.123
but zoophilia,
which is a Ioving,
Iife commitment.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.788
Unfortunately,
we're not Iooking
for zoo couples.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.095
You got anything
a Iittle further up
the violence scale there?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.260
Crush video operation.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.169
Films contain shots
of small creatures.

14:33.239 --> 14:36.072
Frogs, hamsters,
baby bunnies and whatnot.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.672
A woman's
stiletto-heeled foot
enters frame...

14:38.744 --> 14:40.735
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I can't hear that stuff.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.246
Well, that goes
in the good pile.

14:42.314 --> 14:45.806
Arson at those stables
in Brooklyn.
Twenty-one horses were killed.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.285
Dog-fighting ring.
Now you're talking gangs.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.879
That'II be right there
with Tilden's
most violent perps.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.321
You know how they train
those dogs to fight?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.517
They starve them, beat them,

14:53.592 --> 14:56.152
and then they collect strays
to use as sparring partners.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.923
Come fight night,
big money changes hands

14:57.997 --> 14:59.828
and only one dog
comes out alive.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.764
MFPCA removed
those dogs, right?

15:01.834 --> 15:04.803
Ten pit bulls.
Brought in gang intel
to shut down the operation.

15:04.870 --> 15:09.364
Was there payback?
Kennel was vandalized
two days Iater.

15:10.376 --> 15:13.072
They broke in here,
graffitied the place
with gang symbols.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.772
Why didn't you
mention that before?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.974
(DOG BARKING)
It was an isolated incident
months ago.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.017
And between drug busts
and assorted felonies,

15:19.084 --> 15:20.711
the gang's been
pretty much decimated.

15:20.786 --> 15:22.253
Hey, pooch.
Well, hey there.

15:22.321 --> 15:27.486
I can always spot
an animal Iover. Pam used
to spend her downtime in here.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.790
It doesn't surprise me
she went to that park
after dark,

15:30.863 --> 15:34.128
not if she thought
there was a hurt animal
in there.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.999
AII these animals
were abused?
Mmm-hmm. Or neglected.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.267
They're all up for adoption
if you're interested.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.509
Did you talk
with Agent Tilden?
Sure.

15:45.577 --> 15:47.374
She ever mention anyone

15:47.446 --> 15:50.847
causing trouble,
threatening her,
something Iike that?

15:51.717 --> 15:54.584
Yeah, the kid
who did this one.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.950
(SIGNALING)

15:57.022 --> 15:59.456
(CAT PURRING)
Hey, SIinky. Hi.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.182
What did he do to her?

16:01.260 --> 16:04.195
Poured paint thinner
on her tail,
and set it on fire.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.993
Wanted to see
what she would do.
How old the kid?

16:07.066 --> 16:09.899
OId enough to know better.
Fifteen, sixteen, maybe.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.869
And he threatened
Agent Tilden?

16:11.937 --> 16:15.634
Said whenever
she ran into him upstairs,
he'd cuss her out.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.999
(PHONE RINGING)
What was he doing here?

16:18.077 --> 16:20.136
That's the court's
big punishment.

16:20.212 --> 16:23.511
Ten sessions on the couch
with our company shrink.

16:23.582 --> 16:24.674
(DOGS BARKING)
Yeah.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.049
DOCTOR: It's a pilot program.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.647
Court-mandated counseling
for animal abusers.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.590
STABLER: Instead of jail time.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.356
Do you know
the incarceration rate
for cruelty convictions?

16:37.429 --> 16:39.829
BENSON: About zero.
It's a misdemeanor.

16:39.898 --> 16:43.664
$45, few hours
of community service.
Not much of a deterrent.

16:43.736 --> 16:48.298
No, but at Ieast with
this program, they are forced
to address their actions.

16:48.374 --> 16:51.901
Talk about them.
Now, this kid
who torched the cat.

16:53.912 --> 16:56.210
Harry Baker.
What does he talk about?

16:56.281 --> 16:58.306
If Harry had made
any direct threats,

16:58.384 --> 17:01.046
I would have
notified the police
and the person at risk.

17:01.120 --> 17:05.579
And when you say,
"Direct threats"?
Harry has aggression issues.

17:06.157 --> 17:08.922
He had a positive tox screen
at birth, cocaine.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.723
Makes for a hyperactive kid.

17:10.796 --> 17:14.425
Ritalin was recommended
in the first grade.
Harry refused.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.267
Well, didn't his mother
insist?

17:17.336 --> 17:20.601
His mother couldn't afford
daycare, so she'd take him
to work with her

17:20.672 --> 17:22.663
to her strip club.

17:22.741 --> 17:26.507
There was a Iot
of disciplinary problems
for him early in school.

17:26.578 --> 17:30.139
Dumped in Special Ed?
No. Gifted program.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.610
Refocused, he'd have
great potential.

17:34.486 --> 17:38.115
But right now he does
present as predatory.

17:39.525 --> 17:42.892
AII right. AII right.
Well, thank you.
Thanks anyway.

17:46.098 --> 17:49.033
You owe me.
Harry Baker's file.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.530
For what?
There's nothing here.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.538
I asked for transcripts.
On a juvie?

17:54.606 --> 17:58.167
You're Iucky I got
his pre-sentencing report.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.041
Probation Officer recommended
intensive supervision

18:01.113 --> 18:06.949
based on Agent Tilden's
suspicion of numerous
unadjudicated prior offenses.

18:08.287 --> 18:11.085
What do you suppose
those were?
Lord knows.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.124
Any way we can find out?

18:13.992 --> 18:15.220
Shaheen.

18:15.861 --> 18:18.261
I have a fact-finding
in 20 minutes
on a 10-year-old

18:18.330 --> 18:22.357
who took a baseball bat
to his grandmother,
and my witness is in the wind.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.595
You know, we never
rescheduled that Iunch.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.639
From a year ago?
What do you want, AIex?

18:28.140 --> 18:30.665
You prosecuted
the Harry Baker case.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.776
Cat flambe boy.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.370
He was only fifteen,
so you know those records
are sealed.

18:35.447 --> 18:39.144
But your memory isn't.
A Iot of these cases
are a cry for help.

18:39.218 --> 18:42.449
You uncover the dad's
abusing the mom, the mom
in turn abuses the kid.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.614
The kid completes the cycle
by abusing the only member

18:44.690 --> 18:48.649
of the family
more vulnerable, the pet.
Right.

18:48.727 --> 18:51.662
But I didn't find any history
of physical abuse with Harry.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.358
What did you find?
About a dozen other animals

18:54.433 --> 18:57.027
that had turned up dead
and mutilated
in his neighborhood.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.626
Could you Iink
any of them to Harry?

18:58.704 --> 19:00.797
CIosest we came was a girl
he had the hots for.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.864
Let me guess,
she spurned his advances?

19:02.941 --> 19:05.637
She went into a deli,
Ieft her dog tied up outside,

19:05.711 --> 19:08.202
comes back out,
and it's gone.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.943
Could be a coincidence.
It turned up on her stoop
the next morning.

19:12.017 --> 19:13.382
Dead?

19:13.452 --> 19:14.851
Decapitated.

19:21.527 --> 19:26.191
Where was your son
Thursday night between
the hours of 7:00 and 10:00?

19:26.265 --> 19:28.460
In his bedroom,
reading, Iike always.

19:28.534 --> 19:32.334
Were you here all night?
Sure. I had company.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.967
Is this where you sleep?
Yeah, I'm having
the penthouse painted.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.308
This Harry's room?
DAISY: The beads.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.046
Pretty hard not to
overhear company.
Yeah, or walk in on them.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.518
So, what's this
all about anyway?

19:49.021 --> 19:52.388
How Iong has Harry
been killing animals?
He would never do that.

19:52.457 --> 19:55.722
He set a cat on fire.
People say these things
about him,

19:55.794 --> 19:59.423
but they're just jealous
because their own kids
aren't as gifted.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.090
BENSON: He pled guilty.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.629
He's misunderstood.

20:03.702 --> 20:09.470
In science class, he gets
an A-plus because he is
so good at dissecting frogs.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.635
He's just really curious
about the biology stuff.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.440
STABLER: Right.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.879
You mind if we take
a Iittle peek in his room?

20:16.949 --> 20:18.940
He's got nothing to hide.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.315
Tidy.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.188
Could use a splash of color.
Oh, there you are.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.785
BIood-red wasn't
what I had in mind.

20:32.698 --> 20:34.461
Fire escape right outside
the window.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.661
Yeah, how hard would it be
to sneak out
while Mom's entertaining?

20:37.736 --> 20:40.796
No smell.
No nooks and crannies
big enough to stash a head.

20:40.872 --> 20:42.066
Check out this Iibrary?

20:42.140 --> 20:47.737
True crime, police procedure,
every book ever written
on serial killers.

20:47.813 --> 20:51.408
AII in alphabetical order.
HARRY: You Iooking
for something?

20:53.585 --> 20:57.077
Harry. I'd Iike to ask you
a few questions.

20:57.856 --> 20:59.721
It's about Pam, right?

21:00.392 --> 21:01.984
That really bites.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.621
Pam?
Officer Tilden.
We were kind of tight.

21:06.064 --> 21:09.090
She arrested you,
testified against you,

21:09.167 --> 21:10.794
even threw you
into counseling.

21:10.869 --> 21:11.858
Yeah.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.172
STABLER: You the type
to hold a grudge?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.538
I've been known to,
but Pam was cool.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.878
I read her death
was totally whack.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.404
Course, they...
They never publish
all the details.

21:24.483 --> 21:28.112
Any you can give me?
No. Any you can give us?

21:28.687 --> 21:30.314
What do you mean?

21:30.555 --> 21:34.787
STABLER: Well, you got
Pathology of Homicide,

21:34.860 --> 21:37.021
Death Investigator's Handbook,

21:37.095 --> 21:39.928
Seems Iike your interests
run pretty dark.

21:40.032 --> 21:44.093
My shrink says I have
an aggressive orientation
to the world.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.103
Something about
a predatory drive.

21:47.172 --> 21:51.131
Says if I don't re-channel it,
I could... I could wind up...

21:51.209 --> 21:53.973
What'd she say... A cop.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.340
Well, we also heard
that you have experience
with surveillance.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.647
Girl in your class,
Carey Thorne?

22:00.719 --> 22:03.244
I broke her heart.
BENSON: By killing her dog?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.620
No, by ending
our relationship.

22:05.691 --> 22:08.125
Not to sound egotistical
or anything,

22:10.362 --> 22:12.990
but I drive the girls
a Iittle crazy.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.595
It was horrible.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.607
He was always calling,
following me around.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.940
I'd go to the movies
or the ice rink, there he was.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.673
He ever threaten you?

22:28.747 --> 22:31.841
He used to Ieave these
creepy Ietters in my Iocker.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.715
I was scared for my Iife.
Describe creepy.

22:35.053 --> 22:38.955
Like, he's Iiving
only for me.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.084
He dreamed we died
in a car crash together.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.685
Or, if he can't have me,
nobody can.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.932
You still have
any of these Ietters?
God, no. I burned them.

22:47.999 --> 22:51.332
Did you notify the police?
They talked to Harry.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.201
He turned on the charm,
got his friends
to Iie for him.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.297
Suddenly, at school,
I'm the nutcase.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.343
Your friends seen
any of these Ietters?

22:58.410 --> 23:00.878
They were Iike,
"What's your problem?
He's so cute."

23:00.946 --> 23:03.972
We need to get Harry
off the street, but we're
gonna need your help.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.175
You don't get it.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.981
AII I did was
turn him down for a date,
and he killed my dog.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.749
I'm not messing with Harry.

23:10.822 --> 23:14.189
Could you at Ieast
steer us toward someone
who would?

23:19.064 --> 23:22.261
FIN: Phillip. Oh, Phillip.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.861
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.869
Now, what have we here?

23:31.943 --> 23:35.310
This door
appears to be Iocked,
but do you see Iegs?

23:35.380 --> 23:37.348
No, must not be here.

23:43.522 --> 23:44.511
Cooking spray.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.853
Now, what do you suppose
he thinks is gonna get stuck?

23:46.925 --> 23:48.586
Come on out, Phil.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.591
What do you guys want?
FIN: Lowdown
on your buddy, Harry.

23:54.666 --> 23:58.762
We're not tight anymore.
Let me guess,
you're missing a pet?

23:59.438 --> 24:02.601
Dude's obsessed with death.
And it's one thing
to hate cats,

24:02.674 --> 24:05.643
but Harry went super freak.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.201
FIN: Anything involving
a hunting knife?

24:08.346 --> 24:10.712
Where does he keep it?
How should I know?

24:10.782 --> 24:11.806
See.

24:11.883 --> 24:15.512
You're burning out
too many brain cells.
Affects your memory.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.078
Maybe we should give
his principal and parents
the 411

24:18.156 --> 24:20.181
on his Iittle huffing habit.
AII right.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.818
He's got this place
in Central Park.

24:22.894 --> 24:26.193
It's private,
so he can be alone
with his collection.

24:26.264 --> 24:27.993
Collection of what?

24:28.867 --> 24:30.061
Skulls.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.172
(SIRENS WAILING)
CRAGEN: The kid told us

24:34.239 --> 24:38.835
that Harry's been slicing
and dicing furry things
for years.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.845
You got a fix
on him, yet?
Yeah.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.074
He's a sadistic sociopath.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.585
He Iikes to take his time,
draw out the pain.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.644
He gets off on the control
and the domination.

24:50.722 --> 24:53.088
During the torture,
he feels no empathy,

24:53.158 --> 24:55.820
and when it's over,
he feels no remorse.

24:56.228 --> 25:00.255
Okay,
but what I don't get is this.
His burial ground is here.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.960
Why Iure Agent Tilden
to Riverside Park?

25:03.034 --> 25:04.501
TECH HARRY: Look at this.

25:10.141 --> 25:11.540
Open it up.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.275
Harry's heads.

25:18.049 --> 25:21.416
Looks Iike there's about
a dozen in there.
They're small.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.511
My guess is cats and dogs.

25:31.096 --> 25:35.123
Big. I'd say hunting.
Get this to the Iab.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.168
Anything human in there?

25:39.905 --> 25:40.997
TECH HARRY: No.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.203
I don't understand
why we're here.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.744
They think I killed
two people.

25:46.811 --> 25:50.645
DAISY: That's ridiculous.
Harry's a good boy.
He gets straight A's.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.913
Well, he also gets his kicks
playing with the heads
of animals he's butchered.

25:54.986 --> 25:58.183
That's not true. Harry?
Take a pill, Mom.

25:58.256 --> 26:00.383
I'm not gonna Iisten
to these Iies.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.085
It's just an
interrogation technique.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.320
Now they've got you
good and riled,

26:03.395 --> 26:05.522
and it's time for Q and A.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.293
First, they'd wanna know
if I'm a bed wetter.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.596
This is all about
the accident with the cat.

26:10.669 --> 26:12.864
(SIGHING)
That gave them fire setting
and animal abuse.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.839
Throw in enuresis
and I fit the triad
of sociopathy.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.967
Three childhood indicators
of a future serial killer.

26:19.044 --> 26:20.944
So, did he wet his bed?

26:22.881 --> 26:23.905
Can we go now?

26:23.982 --> 26:28.316
Harry, animal torture,
that's the biggie.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.987
That's true. I mean, Iook at
all the major Ieaguers.

26:31.056 --> 26:35.686
As a kid, Jeffrey Dahmer
used to impale dogs and frogs
and cats on sticks.

26:36.294 --> 26:39.024
AIbert Desalvo,
the alleged Boston Strangler.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.156
He used to take dogs and cats
and put them in crates

26:41.232 --> 26:42.893
and then shoot arrows
through the slats.

26:42.968 --> 26:46.369
And Iittle Teddy Bundy,
I mean, he killed
more than his share.

26:46.805 --> 26:49.865
As did... As did Son of Sam.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.308
Andrew Cunanan.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.513
Most of your high school
shooters Iike Kip Kinkel...

26:56.581 --> 26:59.379
I mean, the list goes
on and on and on,,,
Stop it!

27:00.952 --> 27:01.941
(CHUCKLES)

27:05.790 --> 27:07.587
That is one cold kid.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.627
No conscience,
no regard for others,

27:10.695 --> 27:13.858
and yet superficially
charming, manipulative.

27:13.932 --> 27:17.868
And an expert on everything,
whether he did it or not.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.963
Mrs. Baker needs a break.
She's waived Harry's Miranda.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.099
Let's get you some coffee.

27:27.545 --> 27:31.675
This kid knows all the tricks.
Any suggestions?

27:32.317 --> 27:34.717
His ego is too inflated
not to instruct and inform.

27:34.786 --> 27:38.222
Get him to talk about it
hypothetically, third person.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.686
We've got your knife, kid.

27:43.762 --> 27:46.128
It's only a matter of time
before they find
the victims' blood on it.

27:46.197 --> 27:50.156
Look, if it was me,
I would have cleaned it
very thoroughly,

27:50.268 --> 27:52.327
but it wasn't me.
BENSON: Okay.

27:53.104 --> 27:54.901
Well, then, who was it?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.530
Sorry, I can't
help you there.

27:56.608 --> 28:00.305
Wow, all those books,
you can't put together
a simple profile?

28:03.648 --> 28:06.708
Caucasian male.
Late 30s, early 40s.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.788
Menial job. Lives alone.

28:11.923 --> 28:13.447
How'd he do it?

28:13.825 --> 28:17.454
He was already in the park.
He was waiting in the shadows.

28:18.229 --> 28:20.993
It took her
a while to find it,
but he didn't mind.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.534
The hunt's the most
exciting part.

28:23.601 --> 28:26.661
Took her a while
to find what?
The injured animal.

28:27.739 --> 28:32.403
If he knew her,
that's what he used as bait.
I mean, why else would she go?

28:34.379 --> 28:35.607
Why her?

28:38.016 --> 28:40.348
Maybe she rejected
his advances.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.949
STABLER:
So he Iures her to the park,
then what?

28:46.624 --> 28:48.990
He takes her
to a private place

28:50.128 --> 28:52.858
where he can be alone
with her a while.

28:54.165 --> 28:58.124
'Cause he owns her now.
He owns her body, her soul.

29:00.371 --> 29:02.896
And now he can do
whatever he wants.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.802
Agent Tilden was in prime
physical condition.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.345
She carried a gun.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.381
I don't see how
he could've overpowered her.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.075
She never saw him.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.441
She was preoccupied.

29:14.519 --> 29:17.420
She was bent over the animal
and it was a blitz attack.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.081
What did he use?

29:21.893 --> 29:24.123
Something handy.

29:26.798 --> 29:28.231
Like a rock.

29:35.039 --> 29:37.064
Was that detail
ever released?

29:37.142 --> 29:40.373
No.
Could be a Iucky guess.

29:40.445 --> 29:44.347
I don't care
if it's a psychic vision,
it's enough to book him.

29:50.355 --> 29:52.186
Just finished
processing Harry.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.748
He actually hit on
the mug shot photographer.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.488
We get the Iab results
back for the knife?
CIean.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.291
What's Cragen doing here
this Iate?

29:59.364 --> 30:01.992
MUNCH: Running us ragged.
LUDs finally came back
from Tilden's cell.

30:02.066 --> 30:05.331
Her Iast call came in
at 6:37 p.m. from MFPCA.

30:05.403 --> 30:08.031
Dispatch said that
her Iast call came in at 5:30.

30:08.106 --> 30:11.439
Didn't come from dispatch.
We traced it to a phone
down in the kennels.

30:11.509 --> 30:14.967
Finally finished running
all their employees. Only one
popped up in the system.

30:15.046 --> 30:17.014
Who?
CRAGEN: Joe Poletti.

30:20.451 --> 30:22.976
We talked to him.
He's a dog walker.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.581
And a seven-time rapist.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.130
Detectives.
BENSON: In there, Poletti.

30:33.198 --> 30:37.658
Hey, that's the guy
from the kennel, right?
Is he the one who did it?

30:37.735 --> 30:40.295
What are we doing
with him?
Cutting him Ioose.

30:40.371 --> 30:44.831
Let's do this again
real soon.
Count on it.

30:49.447 --> 30:52.575
I was in Atlantic City.
Left right after work.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.310
I hit a royal.

30:54.385 --> 30:58.845
Joey, you called Agent Tilden
from the kennel at 6:37 p.m.

30:59.324 --> 31:02.953
It wasn't me.
A Iot of people have access
to that phone.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.927
How'd you get down
to AC?
My van.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.191
He's got a van.
Yeah, they all do.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.927
Don't tell me,
you just had it detailed.

31:10.001 --> 31:11.491
It's funny you should say
'cause I was about to,

31:11.569 --> 31:15.369
but someone swiped it.
Joe, can you breathe
without Iying?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.431
STABLER: You file
a police report?

31:18.309 --> 31:20.641
No. Can I do that here?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.044
Don't worry,
we're gonna find
that van for you.

31:23.114 --> 31:25.605
Does anyone down at the "M"
know your past?

31:27.252 --> 31:28.241
Hmm?

31:29.954 --> 31:31.080
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:31.756 --> 31:33.383
It never came up.

31:34.626 --> 31:35.991
It should've
on your job application.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.493
You should know
that's a violation,

31:37.562 --> 31:39.189
the number of times
you've been on parole.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.198
BENSON: Took your first
rape collar at 18.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.928
Got Iucky
with that one. Probation.
That's ancient history.

31:44.002 --> 31:46.630
Oh, history has a way
of repeating itself.

31:46.704 --> 31:49.172
You did three years
for the rape of Coral Jividen.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.299
She was my girlfriend.
She was 14 years old.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.503
You're out, what, two weeks
before you start your string.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.808
STABLER: Five break-in rapes
all at knifepoint.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.542
I don't have
those feelings anymore.

31:58.616 --> 32:02.074
That'd make you the first
I've come across.
I got help.

32:02.153 --> 32:03.950
I never missed a session
while I was in.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.456
I finished the program
after I got out,
three years ago.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.219
Three years
of that pressure building.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.557
Pam Tilden was at that kennel
every single day

32:10.628 --> 32:14.428
and you try to fight
those urges, but they kept
getting stronger and stronger.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.228
The walls you build up
crumble.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.598
You pick up right where
you Ieft off.

32:17.669 --> 32:18.863
Okay, I was sick back then.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.201
But, tell me, how many
of those people I killed?

32:21.272 --> 32:22.330
Huh?
STABLER: None.

32:22.407 --> 32:26.104
That's why you did
twelve years. Living victims,
Iiving witnesses.

32:26.177 --> 32:27.235
You didn't wanna go back,

32:27.312 --> 32:29.837
and that's why you killed
Pam Tilden and Ed Boggs.

32:29.914 --> 32:32.348
No.
That's why you cut off
her head and hands,

32:32.417 --> 32:35.079
so she couldn't be
Iinked to you.
No!

32:42.727 --> 32:44.490
I'm rehabilitated.

32:52.203 --> 32:53.727
PIease tell me
there's a head in there.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.103
We tore Poletti's house apart.
This is all we could find.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.472
His pleasure chest.

32:58.543 --> 33:03.640
Victoria's Secret catalogs,
strip club flyers.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.013
Personal ads
from New York Magazine,

33:06.084 --> 33:09.315
Called a few 900 numbers.
Sex chats are
on his no-no Iist.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.322
Yeah, but we want him
for murder, not some
pissant parole violation.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.655
You want him off the street
or what? We're getting him
on what we can.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.560
Pretty gray area stuff.
I doubt a hearing officer
will even go for it.

33:18.629 --> 33:20.927
I'II take anything
at this point.
What will it get him?

33:20.999 --> 33:24.196
Whatever he still owes
on his parole.
Three weeks, two days.

33:24.268 --> 33:25.929
There you go,
now there's justice.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.562
Three weeks
for a double murder.

33:27.638 --> 33:30.903
This is plenty of time
for him to rest up
and find his next attack.

33:30.975 --> 33:33.102
MUNCH: Or catch up
on his writing.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.001
Prolific Iittle bastard.

33:35.079 --> 33:37.980
About twenty short stories
of wall-to-wall rape torture.

33:38.049 --> 33:40.711
Anything in there
a thinly veiled Tilden/Boggs
confession?

33:40.785 --> 33:44.243
No, but a rave review
from one of his old
offender program buddies.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.552
He sent them
to another sex offender?

33:46.624 --> 33:48.353
"Joe, Iast batch
was your best, yet.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.894
"Jumper cables
to the girls' goodies
finished me off.

33:50.962 --> 33:54.363
"Send extra copies
of the next one. They're
a big hit with the guys."

33:54.432 --> 33:56.059
Let me see those.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.798
CONRAD:
They're his private thoughts.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.399
That's funny,
I saw them in print.

34:05.476 --> 34:08.809
People v, Kirkpatrick
found mere possession
of obscene material

34:08.880 --> 34:12.145
without dissemination
is not subject
to prosecution.

34:12.216 --> 34:14.206
He mailed more than
six copies of his story,

34:14.284 --> 34:15.717
meeting the presumption
of dissemination.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.755
He sent them to friends.
Fellow sex offenders.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.018
Don't you see
what the A.D.A. is doing?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.925
She couldn't substantiate
murder charges
against my client,

34:23.995 --> 34:26.987
so she's shooting blind,
seeing what sticks.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.795
I do not take
a serial rapist's graphically
violent writings

34:29.867 --> 34:32.097
about the torture of women
and children Iightly.

34:32.170 --> 34:35.230
This is back door,
and you know it.
Your client opened that door.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.536
Save it for the ethics board,
Miss Conrad.

34:37.608 --> 34:40.634
I'm only here
to decide whether the charge
tracks under the statute.

34:40.710 --> 34:45.148
The obscenity statute
is overly broad and void
for its vagueness.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.013
It encompasses everything
and nothing.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.315
CABOT: In the venerable words
of Justice Potter Stewart,

34:49.387 --> 34:52.550
"I can't define it,
but I know it when I see it."

34:53.123 --> 34:56.389
Two words, First Amendment.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.328
The Supreme Court
has come down on the side
of Iimiting free speech

34:59.397 --> 35:03.197
when the need
to protect the public
is of overriding importance.

35:03.968 --> 35:07.460
I'm inclined to think
you're over-reaching
on this one, Miss Cabot,

35:07.538 --> 35:09.870
but I'm going to Iet
a jury decide.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.846
JUDGE: Mr. Foreman,
have the members of the jury
reached a verdict?

35:21.986 --> 35:24.955
FOREPERSON:
We have, Your Honor.
What is your verdict?

35:25.022 --> 35:28.185
On the sole count,
obscenity in the Third Degree,

35:28.259 --> 35:31.626
we find the defendant,
Joseph Paul Poletti,

35:31.696 --> 35:32.822
guilty.

35:32.897 --> 35:34.194
(PEOPLE MUTTERING)

35:35.700 --> 35:37.361
Motion to set aside verdict.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.130
Denied.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.401
JUDGE: Remand continued
until sentencing.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.633
(GAVEL BANGS)

35:49.580 --> 35:52.242
Nice snow job.
Well, I knew I had him

35:52.316 --> 35:55.217
when juror number six
asked me to stop reading
one page into it.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.550
It's a misdemeanor.
One year max.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.783
There's no statute
of Iimitations on murder.

35:59.857 --> 36:03.315
That year
is what I've just bought you
to find the head.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.407
What are you doing here?

36:18.376 --> 36:19.638
Homework.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.311
Come here,
you sick Iittle freak.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Criminology 101, Detective.

36:24.849 --> 36:28.478
If you're gonna break the Iaw,
you don't want
witnesses around.

36:30.154 --> 36:31.485
You think you're real cute,
don't you?

36:31.556 --> 36:33.217
Twenty-three cheerleaders
can't be wrong.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.191
I know where you Iive,
I know where you Iearn,

36:35.259 --> 36:37.955
and I know where
you bury your kill.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.053
You get used to my face,
'cause you're gonna be
seeing it

36:40.131 --> 36:44.090
every time you turn around.
Don't Iose your head,
Detective,

36:44.168 --> 36:46.329
you're having enough trouble
finding one.

36:48.172 --> 36:51.505
That's good. We found
your whole stash.

36:54.812 --> 36:58.441
You think? There never is
just one stash.

37:04.121 --> 37:06.612
We gave up too easily.
We didn't find Poletti's
real stash.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.956
Go back through that house
over every scrap of paper,

37:10.027 --> 37:11.858
pull up his financials,
dig up the backyard.

37:11.929 --> 37:15.330
I want every key he owns
matched to a Iock,
every Iock accounted for.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.332
Poletti's stolen van.

37:23.007 --> 37:24.065
Jackpot.

37:27.178 --> 37:30.739
Joey's Iittle
reading room.
His own Yankee Stadium.

37:33.684 --> 37:34.981
Not here.

37:36.787 --> 37:39.085
I think we got blood stains.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.048
It's blood, all right.
STABLER:
So match it to Tilden.

37:43.127 --> 37:44.992
That's problematic.
Why?

37:45.062 --> 37:48.793
Because
of the cell-surface antigens.
It's canine blood.

37:48.866 --> 37:51.130
He tracked it in here
from work.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.863
We Iost him again.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.733
Have a Iittle faith.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.904
I got his travel itinerary
off his tires.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.975
South Jersey, above bedrock,
is unconsolidated marine sand.

38:02.046 --> 38:04.037
Atlantic City.
He already told us that.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.982
Did he mention something about
a skid mark along the way?

38:07.051 --> 38:09.451
Or a sharp U-y?
How do you know that?

38:09.520 --> 38:12.182
I found microscopic fragments
of glass beads

38:12.256 --> 38:14.816
and of yellow and white
reflective paint.

38:14.892 --> 38:17.417
GIass beads could be
any stretch of road,
but the paint...

38:17.495 --> 38:20.794
Yellow and white together
could be a hill
or a sharp curve.

38:20.865 --> 38:25.234
The outer depositional strata
of dirt says he then pulled
off of the paved road.

38:25.303 --> 38:30.206
We got a heavy buildup
of soil inside a wheel well
and inside the bumper.

38:30.274 --> 38:31.866
He spun his tire
in the mud.

38:31.942 --> 38:35.400
I got shoeprints
inside the van,
the same consistency.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.809
So he got out of the van
to dump the head, and then
he floored it out of there.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.408
Do we have a clue
as to where "there" is?

38:41.485 --> 38:44.249
Some place with a high Ievel
of soil contamination.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.552
BENSON: What kind?
Chemical byproducts.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.991
X-ray fluorescence
spectrometer will give us
the exact composition.

38:50.061 --> 38:53.087
You're saying it's near
a chemical plant.
What, with Ievels this high,

38:53.164 --> 38:56.600
I say he practically
stopped on top
of one's drainage ditch.

38:57.068 --> 39:00.003
Think you got enough red
up there?
Garden State, my ass.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.802
I guess "Chemical Capital
of the World" didn't have
the same zing to it.

39:03.874 --> 39:06.274
Well, Iet's narrow it down
to the ones along his route.

39:06.344 --> 39:10.007
From the crime scene to AC.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.276
Now we've confirmed
that he made it all the way
down there?

39:12.350 --> 39:13.578
He was there.
He didn't get a room,

39:13.651 --> 39:15.084
but he gambled
until 5:00 in the morning.

39:15.152 --> 39:18.019
He pulled on his first
one-armed bandit at 12:52.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.078
Which fits the window.

39:19.156 --> 39:20.953
Has him Ieaving Manhattan
between 10:00 and 11:00.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.492
How do we know the times?

39:22.560 --> 39:24.960
Well, we spoke to the casino.
He uses a player's card.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.190
Just missed winning
the free Wayne Newton tickets.

39:27.264 --> 39:31.200
Okay. So from the crime scene,
he jumps on
the West Side Highway.

39:31.268 --> 39:34.431
BENSON: Finds his way
over the Manhattan Bridge
down to the BQE.

39:34.505 --> 39:36.803
On and off to ditch the hands
but not the head?

39:36.874 --> 39:38.273
Well, CSU measured.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.333
Head was too big
to fit through
the sewer grate.

39:40.411 --> 39:43.744
CRAGEN:
Right, so he continues down
over the Verrazano Bridge,

39:43.814 --> 39:46.908
maybe a quick stop at home?
Tossed the house.
Nothing there.

39:46.984 --> 39:50.147
AII right,
then he continues on
over the outer bridge,

39:50.221 --> 39:54.248
and it is a straight shot
down the parkway.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.691
Easy access
to about eight plants.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.023
Mercury.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.326
The soil contained
absurdly high Ievels
of mercury.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.162
We're Iooking
for a mercury plant?
No, no.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.395
PIants use mercury
as a cathode.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.869
A current is passed through
electrolytic cells

40:07.938 --> 40:10.964
to decompose salt brine.
The end product being?

40:11.041 --> 40:13.066
Chlorine
and sodium hydroxide.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.669
How many plants
are there in Jersey
that produce that?

40:15.746 --> 40:18.214
Hold on. I also found
a Iow pH Ievel.

40:18.282 --> 40:20.477
It might also produce
hydrochloric acid.

40:20.551 --> 40:23.111
Ramone, how many plants
we talking?
Just one.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.451
IDJ Chemicals.
It's right in Toms River.

40:25.556 --> 40:28.081
BENSON: Halfway down.
Right off the Parkway.

There's still one diver
down there.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.229
You know how cold
that water is?

40:41.305 --> 40:44.206
They were supposed to be up
45 minutes ago.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.076
They'II find it.
They found Poletti's
tire tracks.

40:53.150 --> 40:57.211
Doesn't mean a thing
without that head.
CIothing, knife, anything.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.425
You find anything?

41:02.493 --> 41:04.825

couple hundred
cigarette butts.

by to gloat.
Yeah?
