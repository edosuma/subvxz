Sir, I'm gonna tell you the truth.

19:28.446 --> 19:31.781
Now, the leader of this
band, whose bag this is not,

19:31.816 --> 19:34.417
will be greatly
affected by this incident,

19:34.452 --> 19:37.019
and I believe him to be one
of the finest gentlemen

19:37.055 --> 19:38.754
you could ever imagine.

19:38.790 --> 19:40.690
He gave me stand-up
work, and he did the same

19:40.725 --> 19:43.626
for every one of them

19:43.661 --> 19:45.595
And he is struggling right now

19:45.630 --> 19:47.897
with the band and helping them grow.

19:47.932 --> 19:50.199
And if you arrest him,
all they'll be known for

19:50.235 --> 19:51.968
is arrest and violence.

19:52.003 --> 19:54.870
But if you let him go,

19:54.906 --> 19:56.372
he's gonna turn this group around.

19:56.407 --> 19:58.241
See, he is the soul of this group,

19:58.276 --> 20:01.377

what music is gonna be.

20:01.412 --> 20:04.747

What do you know about why I was hired?

39:56.473 --> 39:59.340
What?

39:59.376 --> 40:01.509
You once said that you were loyal.

40:03.480 --> 40:07.482
I need you to be loyal to me right now.

40:07.517 --> 40:08.950

40:08.985 --> 40:10.985
Come on, man.

40:12.322 --> 40:15.590
Come on.

Preston wants Tom to go solo.

40:18.628 --> 40:19.928
Fuck.

40:19.963 --> 40:22.497
You didn't hear that from me.

40:22.532 --> 40:24.432
We had to show Tom the numbers

40:24.468 --> 40:27.268
that he can make more
money without Christopher.

40:27.304 --> 40:29.504
Mm.

40:29.539 --> 40:32.707
So no amount of savings I
found would ever have mattered?

40:32.742 --> 40:34.309
Mm-mm.

40:34.344 --> 40:36.478
Preston would have given
Tom the same result.

40:59.503 --> 41:02.170
They smuggled the real

41:02.205 --> 41:05.373
I went home after the
lawyers did a little do-si-do.

41:05.408 --> 41:07.575
Took a year off to raise my kid.

41:07.611 --> 41:10.712
It was Ronnie's idea.

I could have done both.

41:12.115 --> 41:14.015
I missed that band.

41:14.050 --> 41:17.018
Later that year, they
decided to get a private plane

41:17.053 --> 41:20.889
that was fairly cheap, a Convair 240.

The plane ran out of gas over
a swamp in Mississippi.

so did... Steve
Gaines and Cassie Gaines,

41:54.569 --> 41:55.913
his sister.

41:56.065 --> 41:59.794
So did their assistant road
manager, Dean Kilpatrick,

41:59.829 --> 42:01.696
and two others.

42:01.731 --> 42:06.668
It was the first time

Allen Collins lived for many more years,

43:05.662 --> 43:08.796
probably the Merle

43:28.184 --> 43:29.917
Lynyrd Skynyrd.

43:32.322 --> 43:36.024
Years later, I found another band,

43:36.059 --> 43:37.725
and that's this band and this crew,

43:37.761 --> 43:39.661
the Staton-House Band.

43:39.696 --> 43:42.497
That's why I came back.

43:42.532 --> 43:44.632
I listen to a voice inside,
