00:01.601 --> 00:02.235
What if Broo lived with you

00:02.235 --> 00:03.370
What if Broo lived with
you for a couple of days?

00:03.370 --> 00:04.637
This is great!

00:04.637 --> 00:08.575
Sneer Enterprise
is about to enter the space age.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.910
Bentley? Where's Broo?

00:10.910 --> 00:13.179
I left him outside.
Alone?!

00:14.214 --> 00:17.317
It's Broo!!
On top of the rocket?

00:17.317 --> 00:20.053
Stop the launch!!!

00:20.820 --> 00:22.188
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.992
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.263
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.065
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.400 --> 00:35.468
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.236 --> 00:37.303
Yikes!

00:37.937 --> 00:39.439
Yaaaah...

00:42.208 --> 00:43.510
Yeaaaah!

00:43.510 --> 00:46.646
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.589
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:57.724 --> 00:59.426
Cyril Sneer!

01:02.896 --> 01:05.265
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:05.932 --> 01:07.667
the Raccoons!!

01:07.667 --> 01:08.568
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:22.148 --> 01:25.051
The rivalry between
Cyril Sneer and Mr. Knox

01:25.051 --> 01:28.188
has often made headlines
in the Evergreen Standard.

01:28.188 --> 01:31.324
And once again, Bert, Raccoon,
Ralph and Melissa

01:31.324 --> 01:34.427
have been invited to one of
Cyril's press conferences.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.564
But this time the story is out
of this world.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.566
And if Cyril Sneer has his way,

01:39.566 --> 01:42.735
Mr. Knox will be
out of the picture.

01:42.735 --> 01:43.870
Recognize that?

01:43.870 --> 01:46.873
Knox TV on every screen.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.709
Gee, you must be
a real fan, Cyril!

01:49.709 --> 01:51.644
Fat chance, Raccoon!

01:51.644 --> 01:54.881
The only show worth watching on
Knox's nitwit network

01:54.881 --> 01:56.282
is Steal a Fortune.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.752
It's time the wonderful people
out in TV Land had a choice.

01:59.752 --> 02:02.088
Just what sort of
choice are you offering

02:02.088 --> 02:03.323
the wonderful people?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.191
Endless choice, Raccoon.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.727
Endless choice. Step this way.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.832
Wow, this
is the real thing.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.934
Ladies and
gentlemen of the press,

02:14.934 --> 02:16.369
feast your eyes on...

02:17.337 --> 02:18.404
Sneer One!

02:18.938 --> 02:23.076
The most powerful communication
satellite ever built!

02:23.076 --> 02:26.179
So you're going to have
your own TV channel, Mr Sneer?

02:26.179 --> 02:29.415
Ha! I'm going
to have 340 TV channels

02:29.415 --> 02:30.917
from around the world.

02:30.917 --> 02:33.820
340 channels beamed into

02:33.820 --> 02:36.389
every household in the
Evergreen forest.

02:36.389 --> 02:40.226
Cheap entertainment,
movies, soaps, news.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.295
Why, my audience
will be able to watch

02:42.295 --> 02:45.098
40 sports channels alone!

02:45.098 --> 02:48.935
40 sports channels?!
You've got to be kidding!

02:48.935 --> 02:50.403
When it comes to numbers

02:50.403 --> 02:52.906
Cyril Sneer does not kid!

02:52.906 --> 02:55.475
Knox and his two-bit TV station

02:55.475 --> 02:57.477
don't stand a chance!

02:57.477 --> 02:59.145
You can quote me on that!

02:59.145 --> 03:01.281
Very ambitious Mr Sneer,

03:01.281 --> 03:03.416
but it's one thing
to have a satellite,

03:03.416 --> 03:05.752
and it's another thing
to put it into orbit.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.087
You want
ambitious, Raccoon?

03:08.087 --> 03:10.123
Well, I'll show you ambitious.

03:14.561 --> 03:19.098
Sneer Enterprises is
about to enter the space age!

03:24.470 --> 03:27.807
Aw, come on!
You never let me have anything!

03:27.807 --> 03:30.643
Ohh, you
poor, deprived child!

03:30.643 --> 03:32.679
George, why are we
such horrible monsters

03:32.679 --> 03:34.514
to our wonderful little boy?

03:34.514 --> 03:35.949
I guess
we're just rotten

03:35.949 --> 03:37.317
through and through, Nicole.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.852
No, you're
the best, sweetest,

03:39.852 --> 03:42.422
most understanding
parents in the world!

03:43.189 --> 03:45.191
That's why you should
let me have a puppy.

03:45.191 --> 03:46.826
Bentley,
for the last time,

03:46.826 --> 03:48.962
you cannot have a puppy
until you've proven

03:48.962 --> 03:51.598
you're responsible
enough to take care of one.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.833
I just did
the dishes, didn't I?

03:53.833 --> 03:57.570
And you didn't even have
to ask me. I am responsible!

03:57.570 --> 04:01.307
Uh-huh. And what
happened to your goldfish?

04:01.307 --> 04:03.710
But...
I was just a kid then.

04:03.710 --> 04:07.180
If I had a puppy,
I'd walk him and feed him,

04:07.180 --> 04:09.549
and I'd be the best
friend puppy ever had!

04:09.549 --> 04:10.950
You heard
your mother, Bentley.

04:12.118 --> 04:15.588
Fine! I guess I'm
just gonna be a lonely boy

04:15.588 --> 04:19.025
without a dog for the
rest of my natural life.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.693
Sheesh!

04:23.663 --> 04:27.267
Pig 1: Come on, come on,
we haven't got all day.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.573
No, no! To the left!...Right!

04:33.573 --> 04:36.943
Pig 2: So, um, what about
a nice bunch of flowers?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.846
Pig 3: We gave mom
flowers yesterday.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.080
Pig 1: Candy?

04:41.080 --> 04:44.350
Pig 2: Last time we ate it on
the way home from the store.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.553
Pig 3: We always give mom the
same old stuff for Mother's Day!

04:47.553 --> 04:50.056
She deserves something
special for a change.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.392
Looks like
we're right on schedule, Pop.

04:52.392 --> 04:55.428
The launch windows
open at 16:40 hours

04:55.428 --> 04:57.163
Evergreen Standard time.

04:57.163 --> 05:00.500
We still have to do the
satellite final systems checks,

05:00.500 --> 05:03.469
and a final debug of
the computer programs.

05:04.337 --> 05:07.106
I haven't got a clue,
what you're talking about,

05:07.106 --> 05:09.309
but it sounds
nice and technical.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.044
Keep up the good work, son.

05:11.044 --> 05:15.548
Pig 3: How about a nice
set of socket wrenches?

05:15.548 --> 05:17.617
Pig 1: Not very sentimental.

05:17.617 --> 05:21.354
Cut the gab fest up there
before I cut your salaries!

05:22.021 --> 05:24.791
Pig 2: Oh, oh, easy!
Over to the left!

05:24.791 --> 05:26.059
No, no, right!

05:26.059 --> 05:27.694
Not your right!!

05:27.694 --> 05:29.262
Pig 1: Hm!

05:29.262 --> 05:31.297
How do you cut back on nothing?

05:31.297 --> 05:33.566
We're going
to make history, son.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.735
When this baby blasts off,

05:35.735 --> 05:38.404
we're going to boldly broadcast

05:38.404 --> 05:41.808
where no man has
broadcast before!

05:42.809 --> 05:46.379
Pig 1: Where no man
has broadcast before?

05:46.879 --> 05:48.815
Boys, I've got it!

05:48.815 --> 05:51.117
This is gonna be a Mother's Day,

05:51.117 --> 05:53.019
Mama will never forget!!

05:54.087 --> 05:55.321
Ugh! Uh!

05:55.321 --> 05:57.223
Okay,
we've got it in!

05:57.223 --> 05:58.291
Now where do we put it?

05:58.291 --> 05:59.892
How about on the stage?

05:59.892 --> 06:01.928
Everyone can see it from there!

06:01.928 --> 06:04.330
Whether
they want to or not.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.631
Oh, come on, Melissa.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.601
We're going to get 340 channels,

06:08.601 --> 06:11.437
of which 40 are sports channels!

06:11.437 --> 06:12.972
Who wouldn't want to see it?

06:12.972 --> 06:15.908
But you can't
watch 40 sports channels.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.777
We're sure
gonna give it a try!

06:17.777 --> 06:19.312
You know, this
couldn't have come

06:19.312 --> 06:20.613
at a better time.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.582
The baseball playoffs are on.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.984
And we're right in the
middle of the football season.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.453
What? No hockey?

06:27.453 --> 06:30.189
She's right!
It starts next week!

06:32.191 --> 06:33.526
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:34.527 --> 06:36.396
Hip-hi-hooray!
Yaaaaay!

06:36.396 --> 06:39.632
Gee, I sure wish you
guys would try and cheer up.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.835
Hey, Bentley!

06:42.835 --> 06:46.038
Boy, you outta see what
Cyril's up to this time!

06:46.038 --> 06:48.007
He's got a rocket!

06:48.007 --> 06:50.510
And he's gonna launch
a satellite and...

06:51.744 --> 06:53.813
Hey little buddy, why so glum?

06:54.480 --> 06:56.616
I'm not
allowed to have a puppy

06:56.616 --> 06:59.352
until I'm 'responsible.'

06:59.352 --> 07:02.021
And how am I supposed
to get responsible,

07:02.021 --> 07:04.323
if Mom and Dad won't let
me have a puppy to prove

07:04.323 --> 07:06.058
I already am responsible?!

07:06.058 --> 07:08.161
Yeah, that's
a toughie, all right.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.863
I don't understand
parents at all, Bert.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.332
Wait, I got it!

07:13.332 --> 07:16.369
What if Broo lived with
you for a couple of days?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.970
You could take care of him,

07:17.970 --> 07:19.806
you know, prove
you're responsible,

07:19.806 --> 07:23.209
and presto,
problem solved.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.411
Really?
You think I could do that?

07:25.411 --> 07:27.880
If Broo doesn't
mind, it's okay by me.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.082
Uh, what do you say, Broo?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.452
This is great!

07:32.452 --> 07:34.720
I'll be the best puppy
watcher in the world!

07:34.720 --> 07:37.390
Um, um, b-before
you go crazy,

07:37.390 --> 07:40.359
you, you'd better check
it with your mom and dad.

07:40.359 --> 07:43.062
Yeah, right!
Don't go away!

07:43.830 --> 07:45.865
I'm proud of you, Broo,

07:45.865 --> 07:47.867
helping out a friend like this.

07:47.867 --> 07:48.868
Woof!

07:49.535 --> 07:50.903
I don't believe it!

07:50.903 --> 07:54.607
They said yes, he can stay here
for a whole couple of days!

07:55.741 --> 07:57.376
Bert, you just made me

07:57.376 --> 07:59.612
the happiest kid
in the universe.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.320
Okay Schaeffer,
how about this?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.422
If we change next Friday

08:09.422 --> 08:12.058
from the hockey game
to the football game,

08:12.058 --> 08:14.861
that means we can watch the
baseball playoff

08:14.861 --> 08:16.596
and still catch
the golf tournament.

08:16.596 --> 08:20.066
Not bad, but what
about the Snooker challenge?

08:20.066 --> 08:21.100
Oh, yeah.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.170
Wait, it's on during
the baseball game!

08:24.170 --> 08:25.872
We can flip between innings.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.306
Ralph?
Hi, Melissa.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.709
Ohh. Hi, Nicole.
Didn't hear you
come in.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.077
Look what we got!

08:31.077 --> 08:33.279
Tickets for the
ballet next Wednesday.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.014
We stood in line
for two hours, but...

08:35.014 --> 08:37.450
Wednesday, Wednesday...

08:37.450 --> 08:38.918
Oh, here we are.

08:38.918 --> 08:42.255
Oh, gee... not a chance, Melissa.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.557
We've got to watch the
divisional synchronized

08:44.557 --> 08:46.125
swimming finals on Wednesday.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.995
And third round sumo
wrestling is on right after.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.999
Oh, well.. you
couldn't miss that, could you?

08:52.999 --> 08:55.167
Okay, now you've
got all Broo's stuff,

08:55.167 --> 08:58.771
but we'd better go over
the list one more time.

08:58.771 --> 09:01.607
Let's see...
you've got to walk him...

09:01.607 --> 09:03.142
...four times a day.

09:03.142 --> 09:06.245
Brush him once a day, he gets
two bowls of puppy munch,

09:06.245 --> 09:07.980
and freshwater at all times.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.650
I've got it, Bert, just relax!

09:10.650 --> 09:12.919
All set, Bentley?
You bet!

09:12.919 --> 09:16.188
Now you have a good time
with Bentley, okay little buddy?

09:16.188 --> 09:18.224
See you, Bert!
Come on, Broo.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.993
Don't worry,
Bert, Broo will be fine.

09:20.993 --> 09:21.994
All right.

09:21.994 --> 09:25.598
Mother's Day greeting

Bentley? Bentley,
Broo needs to go out!

Now, Bentley!

10:30.696 --> 10:33.766
Ohh mom. I took
him out this morning already.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.435
That was this
morning. This is now!

10:37.603 --> 10:39.238
Ohh, alright!

10:41.240 --> 10:43.643
Okay Broo, let's play!

10:44.443 --> 10:46.212

Hi, Mr. Sneer! What's up?

12:26.378 --> 12:29.815
Bentley, my boy,
the jig is up for Knox,

12:29.815 --> 12:31.884
and Sneer stocks will be up.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.919
That's what's up!

12:34.386 --> 12:37.223
Say Bentley, how do you
like to step inside

12:37.223 --> 12:39.959
and see the greatest feat
of aeronautical engineering

12:39.959 --> 12:41.327
to hit this forest?

12:41.327 --> 12:43.829
You mean your rocket?
Bert told me about it,

12:43.829 --> 12:45.030
but I never thought, I...

12:45.030 --> 12:47.933
Sorry kid,
no dogs allowed.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.668
This is a clean facility,

12:49.668 --> 12:51.737
or as clean as you can
get when you let pigs in.

12:51.737 --> 12:53.906
But Mr. Sneer,
I'm supposed to be

12:53.906 --> 12:55.074
looking out for Broo.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.308
Up to you, Bentley.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.579
You'll be okay on
your own for a little while,

13:00.579 --> 13:01.714
won't you, Broo?

13:02.515 --> 13:03.716
Sure you will.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.385
Just stay there.
I won't be long.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.420
Uh... wait up, Mr Sneer!

13:12.224 --> 13:15.194
Pig 1: There! Our Mother's Day
video greeting

13:15.194 --> 13:18.898
will be the first thing
transmitted by this satellite!

13:18.898 --> 13:20.866
We'll make history!

13:20.866 --> 13:22.768
Pig 2: I'm not so
sure of this anymore.

13:22.768 --> 13:26.438
If the boss finds out,
we'll be history!

13:26.438 --> 13:27.740
Pig 1: Don't worry about it.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.544
I set it to transmit
on Channel 76,

13:31.544 --> 13:33.012
the Culture channel.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.346
Pig 2: Perfect!

13:34.346 --> 13:38.117
The boss'll never watch that
channel in a million years.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.352
But Mom will!

13:40.352 --> 13:41.687
Mom'll what?
Uaaah!

13:41.687 --> 13:44.957
Pig 1: Oh, ehm, mama...
she'll, ehm, uh,

13:44.957 --> 13:47.092
Pig 2: Oh, she'll be so proud

13:47.092 --> 13:50.596
we checked out the monitor
camera in the satellite,

13:50.596 --> 13:53.532
just like you told us to.
Pig 3: Uh-ho-ho!

13:53.532 --> 13:55.034
Uh huh!

13:55.034 --> 13:58.938
Pig 1: And, uh, uh, all
other systems are A-okay,

13:58.938 --> 14:02.441
at optimal and nominal
and, ehm, decimal...

14:02.441 --> 14:04.476
Pig 2: Um, excuse us, boss.

14:04.476 --> 14:08.047
We've got a few last minute
details to see to.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.584
Pretty impressive,
isn't it, Bentley?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.887
I'd like to be humble
about the whole thing, but...

14:14.887 --> 14:17.056
...it's just not me.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.625
Hiya, Bentley!
What do you think of it all?

14:19.625 --> 14:21.393
It's... well,

14:21.393 --> 14:22.928
it's, it's...

14:22.928 --> 14:24.396
Wow!!

14:24.396 --> 14:26.432
Wait'll you
see the control room!

14:27.166 --> 14:30.669
Say, Bentley, how'd you like to
watch the launch from there?

14:30.669 --> 14:32.438
You.. you mean it?

14:32.972 --> 14:36.008
Best seats
in the house!

14:36.008 --> 14:38.611
Well, you won't have
long to wait, Bentley.

14:38.611 --> 14:42.147
I'm just about to run through
the final systems checks.

14:42.147 --> 14:46.418
Launch time is in
T-minus 62 minutes.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.490
Pig 1: Ohh, do you think the
boss suspected anything?

14:51.490 --> 14:52.858
Pig 2: Are you kidding?

14:52.858 --> 14:55.828
Ha! We're way too
sharp for the boss!

14:55.828 --> 14:56.962
Uh!

14:56.962 --> 14:58.764
Pig 3: Hey, get out
of here, you mutt!

14:58.764 --> 15:00.532
No dogs allowed!

15:00.532 --> 15:01.533
Arf!

15:01.533 --> 15:02.768
Uagh!

15:07.273 --> 15:09.541
Pig 1: I don't see him, do you?

15:09.541 --> 15:12.311
Pig 2: Aah.. he musta got out!

15:12.311 --> 15:14.880
Close
satellite access hatch.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.487
And prepare
everything for launch!

15:32.064 --> 15:36.669
Hah! All systems green,
and the payload's on the money.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.672
I could listen to
this rocket talk all day.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.574
Clear the area! Prepare
for final count down!

15:49.348 --> 15:51.850
In less than an hour, Sneer TV

15:51.850 --> 15:53.519
will rule the airwaves.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.660
♪ (slow dramatic music) ♪

16:06.899 --> 16:08.667
There she is, guys!

16:08.667 --> 16:10.803
Uh, what a sight!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.604
Yeah!
Can you believe it?

16:12.604 --> 16:16.608
The Evergreen forest is about
to step into the space age.

16:16.608 --> 16:21.180
Yeah, sports
24 hours a day,

16:21.180 --> 16:23.415
seven days a week!

16:25.517 --> 16:28.354
And to think we
gave up the Stone Age for this.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.555
Gotta race, guys.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.191
Cedric's workin' the
control room for the launch,

16:32.191 --> 16:36.195
and I get to be there!
See you later!

16:36.195 --> 16:37.296
See ya.
Bye, Bert.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.164
It's looking
good, everyone!

16:39.164 --> 16:41.600
Begin final monitor checks.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.403
Okay, monitor one? Check!

16:44.403 --> 16:46.805
Monitor two? Check!

16:46.805 --> 16:48.640
Monitor three? Check.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.914
The rocket is
at the launch point, Pop.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.817
Ready to start automatic
launch sequence.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.786
Let me
do the honors, son.

17:00.786 --> 17:05.090
This is one giant step
forward for Sneerkind

17:05.090 --> 17:07.626
and one step
backwards for Knox.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.229
T-minus five
minutes to launch, Pop.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.398
It's all automatic from here!

17:12.398 --> 17:14.466
Hey!
Sorry I'm late, Cedric.

17:14.466 --> 17:16.635
I didn't miss anything, did I?

17:16.635 --> 17:19.938
Well, we certainly
did not miss you, Raccoon!

17:19.938 --> 17:22.107
Now sit down and
stay out of the way!

17:22.107 --> 17:25.244
Isn't this something?
Mr Sneer's letting me watch!

17:25.244 --> 17:27.780
I even got the push
a couple of buttons!

17:27.780 --> 17:30.282
Boy, you're
one lucky kid, Bentley.

17:30.282 --> 17:33.986
Uh, Bentley... where's Broo?

17:33.986 --> 17:36.622
No dogs allowed!
I left him outside.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.792
I told him to wait by the door.
You left him outside?!

17:40.259 --> 17:41.460
Alone?!

17:41.460 --> 17:44.129
You call that
looking after a puppy?!

17:44.129 --> 17:46.231
But it's only
for a few minutes.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.267
And what could happen
to him anyway?

17:48.267 --> 17:49.701
That's not
the point, Bentley.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.203
You said you'd look after him!

17:51.203 --> 17:55.007
Okay, I'll go
get him, Bert. Sheesh!

17:55.007 --> 17:57.609
I suppose, I can watch
the launch outside.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.611
Pig 1: Monitor nine? Uh...

17:59.611 --> 18:04.149
Uh, boss? I think we have
a glitch on monitor nine.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.686
I think it's
a really big glitch, boss!

18:07.686 --> 18:10.889
It's Broo!!
He's on board the satellite!

18:10.889 --> 18:12.658
On... the satellite?!

18:12.658 --> 18:14.393
On top of the rocket?!

18:14.393 --> 18:16.962
Stop the launch!!

18:16.962 --> 18:19.631
STOP THE LAUNCH!!

18:19.631 --> 18:22.668
We can't stop it, Bert!
It's on automatic.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.803
It's going to blast
off in 3 minutes!

18:24.803 --> 18:26.638
I've gotta
get him out of there!

18:26.638 --> 18:30.209
Cedric, no!!
Come back! It's too dangerous!

18:30.209 --> 18:33.011
I don't care how you do it!
Stop that launch!

18:33.579 --> 18:34.847
Come on, Schaefer.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.015
There's no way the Spoilers
will take the Cup,

18:37.015 --> 18:38.884
not without the Great One!

18:38.884 --> 18:41.520
Well, one man
does not make a team.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.857
Maybe, but you don't
have a team without him.

18:45.824 --> 18:47.159
Something's wrong.

18:47.159 --> 18:50.195
STOP THE LAUNCH!!!

18:52.030 --> 18:53.432
50 seconds!

18:54.099 --> 18:55.267
What's happening?

18:57.169 --> 18:58.937
Pig 2: The boosters
are warming up, boss,

18:58.937 --> 19:00.672
We can't stop it!

19:00.672 --> 19:03.509
Hurry, Cedric! Hurry!

19:03.509 --> 19:06.278
Oooh, please open, please!

19:07.846 --> 19:10.949
Wait! I'll
get it right this time!

19:12.584 --> 19:13.585
Broo!

19:14.720 --> 19:15.721
Move it!!

19:17.089 --> 19:18.757
MOVE IT!

19:20.058 --> 19:21.760
Uaaaaaah!

19:23.929 --> 19:26.131
Come on, Cedric!
What?!

19:28.700 --> 19:30.569
Waaaaah!

19:31.570 --> 19:32.804
No!!!

19:41.446 --> 19:43.115
Uaaaaaah!

19:44.883 --> 19:47.219
NOOOOOO!!!!!
I can't see them!

19:53.659 --> 19:55.260
Oh Broo...

19:55.260 --> 19:58.230
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

19:58.964 --> 20:01.400
It's all my fault, Bert.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.435
I should have never
left Broo all alone!

20:04.970 --> 20:06.271
It's okay, Bentley.

20:06.972 --> 20:08.340
It's all over now.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.946
So mom and dad
said I wasn't ready

20:13.946 --> 20:15.981
to take responsibility
for a puppy.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.349
Well...

20:17.349 --> 20:20.652
Yeah, yeah, you
don't have to say it.
They're right!

20:20.652 --> 20:22.654
However,
it seems to me that

20:22.654 --> 20:25.857
admitting you're not ready
for responsibility

20:25.857 --> 20:28.794
shows a certain amount
of responsibility.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.363
Let's face it, Bert.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.466
I can't be trusted
to take care of a rock.

20:34.466 --> 20:38.170
I figure they won't let
me have a dog until I'm 35.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.306
I don't think, it's
gonna be that long, Bentley.

20:41.306 --> 20:44.042
But meanwhile, I don't
think Broo would mind

20:44.042 --> 20:47.012
if he had two best friends.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.447
What do you say, Broo?

20:48.447 --> 20:49.548
Woof-woof!
