WEBVTT

00:09.277 --> 00:10.178
( buzzer sounds,
door clangs open )

00:11.779 --> 00:14.082
( chains jangling )

00:23.191 --> 00:24.558
Keep it moving, boys.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.659
- Brown?
- Yeah.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.660
Lewis?

00:26.694 --> 00:27.695
Yo.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.097
- Nichols?
- Right.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.164
- Williams?
- Yo.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.532
McDowd?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.267
Brice?

00:33.301 --> 00:35.236
- Yo.
- All right, have a seat, boys.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.675
All set.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.477
Six prisoners--
processed

00:43.511 --> 00:44.445
and secured for transfer.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.518
Have a nice trip.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.489
( buzzer sounding )

01:15.343 --> 01:17.745
Check it out.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.480
It's a 25-footer.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.183
Boat like that, a man can sail
to Catalina,

01:22.216 --> 01:24.718
all the way to Mexico,
if he so desired.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.487
Yeah.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.588
Are we there yet?

01:29.757 --> 01:30.391
( chuckling )

01:31.925 --> 01:33.827
( horn honking )

01:36.497 --> 01:37.865
TRUCK DRIVER:
Out of the way, vato!

01:39.767 --> 01:41.202
( yells, tires screeching )

02:00.354 --> 02:02.423
( two gunshots )

02:02.456 --> 02:04.425
( grunts )

02:12.933 --> 02:14.502
Yo, SeГ±or!
That your truck?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.236
Good.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.271
Get in.
You're giving us a ride.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.239
Vamonos!

02:18.272 --> 02:20.208
Vamonos!
Vengase!

02:20.241 --> 02:21.509
Get in!

02:30.818 --> 02:33.821
DAVID: Sorry to bring you in on
your day off.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.289
DON:
Oh, that's all right.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.290
What's the head
count here?

02:36.324 --> 02:37.725
We got two in the bush.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.892
Witness says there
was an accident,

02:38.926 --> 02:39.927
bus rolled over.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.429
Minute later
there's a shot,

02:41.462 --> 02:43.331
two guys jump out,
car-jack a pick-up,

02:43.364 --> 02:45.699
take off headed west.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.834
Dispatcher said something
about a fatality?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.702
Escort Marshal.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.439
Oh... what do we know
about these guys?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.507
Here's the file.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.542
There's the marshal.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.447
I take it "V" stands
for velocity.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.282
Post-impact velocity.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.684
Oh... and "F", that's
drag coefficient?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.653
Yeah.
You a reconstructor?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.654
Excuse me?

03:06.687 --> 03:07.721
Accident reconstructor.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.291
Oh, no... I'm a professor
of applied mathematics

03:10.324 --> 03:11.392
and I consult
for the FBI.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.261
Wow-- "professor."

03:13.294 --> 03:14.595
Where do you teach?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.429
CalSci.

03:15.463 --> 03:18.332
My ex went to CalSci
for engineering.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.234
He, uh, he actually is a
reconstructor

03:20.268 --> 03:21.335
for an insurance company now.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.436
We met

03:22.470 --> 03:24.505
on a car crash on the 101.

03:25.973 --> 03:28.276
Anyway, um, nice to meet you.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.277
Nice meeting you.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.411
Excuse me.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.945
DON:
Well, call everybody in.

03:31.979 --> 03:32.880
And notify Fugitive Recovery.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.015
We're gonna want them
involved, as well.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.650
All right. Later.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.751
You going in?

03:37.785 --> 03:38.886
Yeah, come on.
I'll give you a ride.

03:38.919 --> 03:39.987
Is this them?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.822
Yup.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.957
One of them has
a life sentence.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.626
No possibility
of parole.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.727
Yeah, nothing to lose.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.799
( echoing ):
We all use math every day...

03:51.832 --> 03:53.701
to predict weather...

03:53.734 --> 03:55.569
to tell time...

03:55.603 --> 03:59.673
to handle money.

03:59.707 --> 04:04.345
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.415
It's logic.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.283
It's rationality.

04:09.317 --> 04:13.554
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.762
DAVID:
Fugitive one: Vincent Williams.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.863
Until this morning,

04:22.896 --> 04:25.299
Vincent was serving eight years
on an arson charge.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.367
Fugitive number two

04:26.400 --> 04:27.901
is Timothy McDowd.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.970
He's a contract killer with a
number of drug dealers

04:30.003 --> 04:31.505
in and around Los Angeles.

04:31.539 --> 04:32.573
Now, he executed

04:32.606 --> 04:34.775
a federal informant about
a year and a half ago

04:34.808 --> 04:37.044
which was witnessed by a woman
who testified against him,

04:37.077 --> 04:39.012
so I would say her safety
is our immediate concern.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.315
DAVID: Local news stations are
running their photos.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.416
We're getting phone tips,

04:42.450 --> 04:43.817
but so far,
nothing has panned out.

04:43.851 --> 04:44.818
As far as we know,

04:44.852 --> 04:46.587
neither of them
have driver's license or IDs,

04:46.620 --> 04:47.355
so I'm not too worried

04:47.388 --> 04:48.556
about them getting
on a plane,

04:48.589 --> 04:49.757
although we should keep
our eye

04:49.790 --> 04:51.459
on the airports, right?

04:51.492 --> 04:52.626
My money says
they stay local.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.494
Hey...

04:53.527 --> 04:55.028
how are you?

04:55.062 --> 04:57.431
Everybody, this is
Agent Billy Cooper, coming to us

04:57.465 --> 04:58.632
Hey.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.667
courtesy of
Fugitive Recovery.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.436
Okay, so these guys

05:02.470 --> 05:03.904
usually go
where they're familiar,

05:03.937 --> 05:05.839
where they're affiliated.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.708
They're both from LA,
so my guess is

05:07.741 --> 05:08.676
they stick around.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.344
Wouldn't it be smarter

05:10.378 --> 05:12.513
to leave the area,
get away from the search?

05:12.546 --> 05:13.814
Yeah, sure it would,
but they're not smart,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.048
which is why they went to prison
to begin with.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.049
DON: Which doesn't mean they're
not dangerous.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.519
So look at the files--
I mean, family, friends,

05:18.552 --> 05:19.787
gang pals... that's the key

05:19.820 --> 05:20.854
to finding them.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.358
Let's go-- let's run
these guys down, all right?

05:24.392 --> 05:25.993
Good to see you, buddy.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.361
Yeah, you look good.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.596
I take it you two know each
other?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.631
Yeah, well, you know I used
to work in Fugitive Recovery.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.999
Well, we were a team.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.266
No better way
to get to know a man

05:33.300 --> 05:35.736
than to spend a week using a gas
station rest room as home base.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.938
Ah, the good old days.
David Sinclair.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.773
Pleasure.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.074
Anyway, so, uh, how
do you wanna play it?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.976
I'm thinking you guys go after
Williams;

05:43.010 --> 05:44.144
I think I'll take McDowd.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.245
All right. What about the
witness who put McDowd away?

05:45.278 --> 05:47.481
I've got LAPD on her,
but I'm gonna go talk to her

05:47.515 --> 05:48.816
about witness protection.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.587
Which room?

05:53.621 --> 05:54.955
First door on the right.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.928
Dr. Fisher.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.063
Oh, you just need
to sign in with reception

06:03.096 --> 06:03.997
before I can see you.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.866
Excuse me... actually,
I'm with the FBI.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.968
My name is Don Eppes.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.804
Talk to you
for a minute?

06:10.838 --> 06:11.905
Uh, yeah.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.907
Just let me know
if there's a change.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.008
Okay.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.183
They told you
what's going on?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.485
Yeah.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.819
I can't tell you
how much I hoped

06:25.853 --> 06:27.521
I'd never hear
the name McDowd again.

06:27.555 --> 06:28.589
I'm sure.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.790
Well, I mean,
I can tell you we're

06:29.823 --> 06:30.891
doing everything
we can to find him.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.594
Right. Sounds very familiar.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.429
Well... look, I
can only imagine...

06:35.463 --> 06:36.864
what you're going through.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.098
Can you?

06:39.767 --> 06:42.803
I mean, I watched this guy
kill a man in cold blood.

06:42.836 --> 06:47.941
The day I testified,
he... looked at me and smiled,

06:47.975 --> 06:51.044
then ran his finger
across his throat.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.447
Look, I mean, what you did
took a lot of courage.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.948
I mean, you
got the guy

06:54.982 --> 06:56.183
a life sentence,
he threatened you.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.186
The smart move would be to err
on the side of caution here.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.822
Look, I-I can't do
witness protection again.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.557
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.958
Just hear me out, okay?

07:04.992 --> 07:05.893
It's not going to be
for long.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.895
I mean, the odds are always
in our favor

07:07.928 --> 07:08.962
in these kind of cases.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.030
I have patients.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.665
I can't abandon them.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.101
Doctor, I'm sure you can find
somebody to cover you.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.669
The last time I went
into protection,

07:15.703 --> 07:16.804
I lost six months of my life.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.540
I mean, I'm
not trying to be brave

07:19.573 --> 07:20.941
but do you have
any specific reason

07:20.974 --> 07:22.843
to think he's coming
after me now?

07:22.876 --> 07:26.647
No... I mean,
nothing specific, but...

07:26.680 --> 07:28.882
Then I'd like
to get back to work.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.955
I'm gonna leave
the officers here.

07:34.988 --> 07:35.823
Here and at your home.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.725
I'm going to have
to insist on that.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.726
Okay.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.728
( cell phone ringing )
Excuse me.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.962
All right. Thank you.

07:41.995 --> 07:42.963
Eppes.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.231
Yeah, I'm on my way.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.838
CHP OFFICER:
This is what doesn't

07:50.871 --> 07:51.839
- make sense to me.
- Okay.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
Why weren't the marks

07:53.206 --> 07:56.209
- from the tires...
- Hey, Charlie...

07:56.243 --> 07:58.178
Hey, this is Officer Morris

07:58.211 --> 07:59.713
of the California
Highway Patrol.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.848
This is my father
and Dr. Fleinhardt.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.950
Oh, please don't tell me
you got another speeding ticket?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.918
( chuckling )

08:04.952 --> 08:05.853
Actually, your son's

08:05.886 --> 08:07.788
helping me with an
accident investigation.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.922
We're trying

08:08.956 --> 08:10.624
to figure out
what caused it.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.925
ALAN: I didn't know you were
consulting

08:11.959 --> 08:13.026
for the CHP. Are you?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.595
Don's case.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.296
Yeah? What sort of accident
involves the FBI?

08:16.329 --> 08:17.798
Prison bus crash.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.933
ALAN: The one I saw on the news.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.102
The bus with
the escaped convicts?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.271
Don is working on that, huh?

08:24.304 --> 08:25.973
Yeah. Why?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.908
ALAN:
Oh, nothing.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.110
It's just that your brother
was working on fugitive recovery

08:30.143 --> 08:32.145
once for a while,
uh... anyway...

08:32.179 --> 08:35.082
LARRY: Appears to be basic
Newtonian mechanics...

08:35.115 --> 08:37.017
the stuff of first-year
engineering students.

08:37.050 --> 08:37.951
Now why have these
elementary

08:37.985 --> 08:40.253
equations so captured
your imagination?

08:40.287 --> 08:43.190
Well, the confluence
of so many unrelated factors

08:43.223 --> 08:45.693
coming together
at a given point in time...

08:45.726 --> 08:46.760
It's actually

08:46.794 --> 08:48.829
quite a fascinating
approach

08:48.862 --> 08:50.263
to Bayesian inference
as applied to the analysis

08:50.297 --> 08:51.932
of time series data.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.067
Yeah, well, as far as I know
anytime an accident happens

08:54.101 --> 08:55.836
it's because somebody
made a mistake.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.937
Am I right?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.706
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.774
CHARLIE: The answer's not that
simple.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.709
I mean,

09:01.742 --> 09:04.011
coincidences
are a mathematical reality.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.713
Statistically
unlikely events can

09:05.746 --> 09:06.814
and often do occur.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.782
Just look at the genesis
of our planet.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.317
LARRY:
Well, now...

09:10.350 --> 09:13.053
I agree that the factors
that brought about life on Earth

09:13.086 --> 09:14.922
were statistically unlikely.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.957
But given the vastness

09:16.990 --> 09:19.059
of the cosmos,
the limitless possibilities

09:19.092 --> 09:20.961
for matter
and energy...

09:20.994 --> 09:23.997
I'm with Einstein on this.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.199
There are no accidents.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.806
DAVID: Williams has been away
for two years.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.207
You really think
seeing his ex-girl

09:34.241 --> 09:35.876
is going to be
tops on his list?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.978
First rule
of man hunting:

09:38.011 --> 09:39.613
Find his woman.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.882
Maybe she found
somebody new.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.085
This is Williams'
prison records.

09:45.118 --> 09:49.623
He used all his phone
privileges calling her.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.660
How long you been
with Don?

09:52.693 --> 09:53.727
Not long.

09:53.761 --> 09:54.662
About a year.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.998
I remember hearing
he came back to L.A.

09:58.031 --> 09:58.832
'cause his mom was sick.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.901
How'd that work out?
She all right?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.903
She died.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.108
That's the downside
of fugitive recovery--

10:08.141 --> 10:09.409
you tend to lose touch.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.411
You seem to enjoy it.

10:11.444 --> 10:15.783
Yeah, the work kind of gets
in your blood, I guess.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.687
Your boss was damn good at it.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.789
He was?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.994
Spent two weeks
in a cemetery once,

10:27.027 --> 10:29.663
waiting for this guy
to show up

10:29.697 --> 10:31.298
at his wife's grave...

10:31.331 --> 10:33.834
Grabbed him as
he was putting

10:33.867 --> 10:35.836
a dozen roses
on her headstone.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.105
( chuckling )

10:38.138 --> 10:40.808
She died while he was
in prison, huh?

10:40.841 --> 10:43.110
No, just before he went.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.145
He's the one
who killed her.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.784
Hey, here we go...

11:03.263 --> 11:05.065
The cans are still
on her property.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.399
Technically, we need a warrant.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.903
Only if we're trying
to build a court case.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.972
We don't have to please
the lawyers on this one.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.273
Here...

11:13.306 --> 11:14.174
use it.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.149
Lady's been shopping.

11:22.182 --> 11:22.983
Lingerie store.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.718
She must have heard
from Williams.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.920
( cell phone ringing)
Well, see?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.488
Just a matter of time now.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.257
Sinclair... when?

11:30.290 --> 11:32.826
DAVID: They found the pickup
truck that was hijacked.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.262
Registration gives the
owner's name as Alberto Diaz.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.164
Runs a gardening
company out of Arleta.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.799
Tried his office,
tried his home.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.967
No answer at either.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.201
See if any cars were reported

11:41.234 --> 11:42.970
stolen in, like,
a three-block radius.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.437
They may have picked
up another vehicle

11:44.471 --> 11:46.106
- by now, you know?
- All right.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.110
You guys got a line on them yet?

11:50.143 --> 11:52.212
Who are you?

11:52.245 --> 11:54.414
Danny Reed, LAPD Narco.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.749
Hey, Danny,
how are you?

11:55.783 --> 11:56.750
Don Eppes. FBI.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.185
Yeah, I recognized the suit.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.087
Why is Narco
interested in this?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.321
McDowd. I was working

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
a multiple drug slaying
when you guys swooped in

12:03.323 --> 12:05.492
and stole him from
me a while back.

12:05.525 --> 12:09.162
Oh, yeah? Well, we appreciate
any assistance you can give us.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.798
I'm sure you would.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.166
So, if the guy's in the wind,
he's fair game, right?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.237
Listen, Reed,
my priority here

12:17.270 --> 12:19.239
is apprehending
a federal prisoner.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.073
What's yours?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.274
My priority is seeing
if I can get

12:21.308 --> 12:23.343
the State of California to stick
a needle in McDowd's arm.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.311
Oh, I see.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.012
The Feds already had
their chance, remember?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.246
Yeah, we put him away for life.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.216
I'll be sure to tell that escort
marshal's widow you said so.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.785
You're not going to get in
my way on this, now, are you?

12:31.819 --> 12:33.186
( cell phone rings )
No, sir, Agent Eppes.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.322
- Good, we're clear on that?
- Very clear.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.523
Good.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.126
Eppes.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.562
Yeah, Charlie.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.331
Okay.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.869
Nobody touches
this truck.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.206
LARRY: I can understand the
fascination

12:53.240 --> 12:54.241
of kinematic equations

12:54.274 --> 12:55.108
when working alongside

12:55.142 --> 12:56.910
an attractive
female police officer,

12:56.944 --> 13:00.380
but... why
all the lawn equipment?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.915
What you said about

13:01.949 --> 13:04.517
the confluence of the cosmos
triggered a thought.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.987
Ah, note to self: Never talk
quantum theory again.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.189
The initial velocity
of the bus

13:09.222 --> 13:11.191
barely exceeds
that of the flatbed.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.560
The gap between them

13:13.593 --> 13:17.197
closing slowly, approximately
two feet per second.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.166
Okay, and then
along comes

13:19.199 --> 13:20.868
- the skateboard?
- That's right.

13:20.901 --> 13:21.902
The pickup truck.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.136
The pickup truck

13:23.170 --> 13:24.838
pulls along
the right side of the bus,

13:24.872 --> 13:26.840
Its velocity
is 13 miles per hour

13:26.874 --> 13:28.508
greater than that of the bus.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.043
Now, at this point,

13:30.077 --> 13:33.146
the gap between the bus
and the flatbed truck

13:33.180 --> 13:34.547
is at least 84 feet.

13:34.581 --> 13:35.682
Okay, that's ample
enough room

13:35.715 --> 13:38.351
for the pickup to safely
maneuver in front of the bus.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.588
However,
the gap suddenly closed.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.326
The pickup veers
in front of the bus...

13:46.359 --> 13:48.228
( tires squeal )
...forcing the bus to maneuver

13:48.261 --> 13:50.230
and hit the guardrail,

13:50.263 --> 13:52.465
which causes it to torque and...

13:52.499 --> 13:54.501
flip onto its side.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.404
How did that gap close
so quickly between the bus

13:57.437 --> 13:59.539
- and the flatbed?
- Two possibilities.

13:59.572 --> 14:03.576
One-- the bus greatly increased
its velocity.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.444
No, no, no, given

14:04.477 --> 14:05.578
the mass of the bus,

14:05.612 --> 14:07.280
that's extremely unlikely.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.348
Or two--

14:08.381 --> 14:10.317
the flatbed truck

14:10.350 --> 14:14.354
reduced its speed
at the critical moment,

14:14.387 --> 14:19.059
causing the pickup to veer
in front of the bus.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.994
That's it.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.863
- The flatbed slowed down.
- That's right.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.533
LARRY:
Well, that would mean...

14:26.566 --> 14:28.135
A Markov Chain.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.937
- Exactly.
- DON: Gentlemen.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.972
- What's all this?
- Just trying to make sense

14:32.005 --> 14:33.573
of something that
doesn't make sense.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.543
Thought that's
what you do best.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.311
What, uh, what's
the problem?

14:38.345 --> 14:40.580
Well, apparently,
that seed spreader.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.184
The flatbed truck.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.086
What-what about it?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.621
The crash wasn't an accident.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.123
Don, it was staged.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.531
All these different
events and factors--

14:58.565 --> 15:00.533
from the initial velocity
of the bus

15:00.567 --> 15:02.569
to its final torque--

15:02.602 --> 15:05.438
all of these create
what's called a Markov Chain.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.606
What kind of chain?

15:06.639 --> 15:09.076
Markov. A sequence
of random values

15:09.109 --> 15:10.944
where the probabilities
at any given time

15:10.978 --> 15:13.246
depend on the values
at a previous time.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.282
The controlling factor
in a Markov Chain

15:15.315 --> 15:16.683
is called
the transitional probability.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.650
Now, in this case,

15:17.684 --> 15:21.254
the bus reaches
a certain point in the road

15:21.288 --> 15:23.623
just as the truck
blocks the lane,

15:23.656 --> 15:25.392
just as the pickup

15:25.425 --> 15:26.259
cuts off the bus.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.261
Which tells you
it wasn't an accident?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.329
Bayesian statistics

15:29.362 --> 15:31.498
and the Chapman-Kolmogorov
equation tell me that.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.134
Are you sure you're his brother?

15:34.167 --> 15:35.602
CHARLIE:
If the flatbed truck

15:35.635 --> 15:37.437
had maintained
its initial velocity,

15:37.470 --> 15:39.639
well, then the pickup
should have enough space

15:39.672 --> 15:41.074
to roam freely

15:41.108 --> 15:42.242
past the bus...

15:42.275 --> 15:44.644
safely-- but it didn't.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.547
The truck slowed down
just at the right moment

15:47.580 --> 15:50.483
just as the pickup
timed its move,

15:50.517 --> 15:54.054
forcing the bus
to veer violently and overturn.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.990
So the pickup driver and
the flatbed guy are in on it.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.691
Only the gardener's missing.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.727
Let's go find
that truck driver.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.330
Good job, Charlie.
Thanks.

16:04.697 --> 16:05.398
FOREMAN:
What'd you say

16:05.432 --> 16:07.300
this driver's
name was again?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.635
Chris Dunlap.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.137
Well, we sub-out
sometimes,

16:10.170 --> 16:12.505
but that's not a name
I've ever heard before.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.541
DON: Well, he was interviewed at
the crash site.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.043
He was driving
one of your trucks.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.544
My trucks weren't
out yesterday.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.113
We're in the middle of a
licensing dispute with the city.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.315
None of our equipment
has rolled in three days.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.517
Well, the number on this one
says 202.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.086
Maybe you got
the wrong company.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.687
No, we don't have
the wrong company.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.222
Yeah, well, all right.
There it is.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.557
Truck's right over here.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.692
Now, you guys
keep mileage logs, right?

16:32.725 --> 16:34.627
We're required
to by law.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.067
- Whoa!
- FOREMAN: Oh, my God!

16:43.403 --> 16:45.072
Yeah, he's cold.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.174
I don't think we're gonna need
that log anymore.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.575
All right, step
back, please.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.776
( camera shutter clicks )

16:49.809 --> 16:50.810
Hey, Eppes.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.079
DAVID:
Don.

16:52.112 --> 16:52.745
Hey.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.481
Dead driver's name

16:54.514 --> 16:56.449
wasn't Dunlap;
it was Brian Zane.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.285
Handful of
possession charges.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.687
Coroner pulled a .40-caliber
slug out of his chest.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.655
And I have something
on the missing gardener.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.791
- Is he still alive?
- Alive enough to board a flight

17:04.824 --> 17:06.626
to Mexico City the
night of the crash.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.727
You're kidding.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.629
Which leaves no way to question
him.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.463
Why are these guys

17:10.497 --> 17:11.564
going to so much trouble
to cover up?

17:11.598 --> 17:14.067
There's nothing in Williams'
profile to suggest he's

17:14.101 --> 17:15.568
capable of pulling
something like this off.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.237
Yeah, well, I think it's McDowd.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.638
Worried about
the witness?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.107
Yes, I am.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.741
Charlie's here.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.315
Hey, buddy.
What's all this?

17:28.348 --> 17:30.350
I've been looking
at all the data you have.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.085
I'm trying to analyze
the methodology

17:32.119 --> 17:33.553
you guys use
to hunt fugitives.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.622
I was explaining
some of the basics to Charlie,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.457
how we focus
on family and friends.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.826
So what do you got?

17:39.859 --> 17:42.662
Well, I've been looking at the
information that is coming in

17:42.695 --> 17:44.697
from these tip lines.
Uh, possible sightings

17:44.731 --> 17:45.698
of Williams and McDowd.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.867
Oh, and violent crimes
that have been committed

17:47.900 --> 17:50.703
since their escape that may have
links to their movements.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.173
You're saying you can do what
I do with just these numbers

17:53.206 --> 17:54.174
on the board?

17:54.207 --> 17:56.309
Well, I'm sure you'll
correct me if I'm wrong,

17:56.343 --> 17:59.412
but the idea is...
to determine

17:59.446 --> 18:01.614
what areas have a greater
statistical probability

18:01.648 --> 18:03.716
of being visited
by your fugitive,

18:03.750 --> 18:05.785
areas, uh, with family,

18:05.818 --> 18:07.620
areas around
former friends.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.123
I mean, those would have
greater probability.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.424
Others would have less.

18:12.825 --> 18:13.860
I mean, I... you know, I mean,

18:13.893 --> 18:16.596
it's the exact same thing I do
with an equation.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.266
I mean, I don't mean to replace
your expertise, but...

18:19.299 --> 18:20.633
( phone rings )
I'm just trying

18:20.667 --> 18:22.169
to cut down your legwork.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.503
Agent Sinclair.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.805
- Hey, I'm all for that.
- DAVID: Okay. Thanks.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.774
Williams was just spotted
at the girlfriend's house.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.909
And I'll bet she's wearing
that pretty outfit, too.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.378
Put together
an entry team.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.245
I'll call you when we're there.

18:32.279 --> 18:32.579
Okay.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.520
Williams got here an hour ago,
went in the back.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.621
An hour?

18:41.654 --> 18:44.757
So he'll probably be tapping
the girlfriend by now.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.194
Looks like there's
a dead bolt.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.595
Convicts like their privacy.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.796
I'm gonna call

18:49.829 --> 18:51.298
- the entry team.
- What?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.666
Hey, and spoil our fun?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.935
Oh, man, tell these guys
to go cover the back.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.271
Let's you and me
go in and grab his ass.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.906
Man...

19:01.274 --> 19:02.675
You ready?

19:02.709 --> 19:04.211
Let's do it.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.181
( hip-hop playing )

19:09.616 --> 19:11.284
( woman screams )
FBI! Don't move!

19:11.318 --> 19:12.785
- Don't move!
- Get your hands in the air!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.621
- Don't do it! Don't do it!
- Get your hands up!

19:14.654 --> 19:16.256
- Up against the wall!
- Get 'em up, both of 'em!

19:16.289 --> 19:17.257
Stand on your
feet! Up! Up!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.258
( hip-hop continues )

19:18.291 --> 19:19.259
I got a .22-caliber.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.760
Not the one
from the bus.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.396
Not the one that did the truck
driver, either. Get up. Get up!

19:23.430 --> 19:24.464
Don't you move!

19:24.497 --> 19:26.366
Turn around and bring your
hands behind your back.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.600
Palms up.
That's right.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.637
COOPER:
Eight-year sentence for arson.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.939
Up for parole in four.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.908
You were halfway home,
Vincent.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.277
Well, not anymore, Coop.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.811
I mean, not with
a murder on his head.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.481
- Murder? I didn't do no murder.
- No? What about

19:41.514 --> 19:42.982
the marshal on the bus you shot?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.252
You know that guy was
a father with two kids?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.819
- That was McDowd, man!
- You know,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.721
it's a real surprise you saying
that,

19:48.755 --> 19:49.989
especially since McDowd's not
here!

19:50.022 --> 19:53.460
Hey! I didn't even know what was
gonna happen till we crashed.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.329
Then McDowd told me to pretend
like I was hurt.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.797
Guard starts
back to help.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.766
Next thing I know,
McDowd shot the dude.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.434
So McDowd knew
the bus was gonna crash?

20:01.468 --> 20:02.635
It seemed like he did, yeah.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.670
Seemed like he did?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.438
What else did it
seem like he knew?

20:05.472 --> 20:07.674
Look we've got a dead
Federal marshal on our hands.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.310
Someone's gonna pay for it--
at this point, it's you.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.912
McDowd's gonna kill somebody.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.013
Who?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.915
He didn't tell me that,
but that's why he broke out.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.250
( door opens )

20:19.819 --> 20:21.421
DAVID:
LAPD just got a solid tip.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.423
McDowd was spotted
40 minutes ago,

20:23.456 --> 20:24.424
Sixth and Alvarado.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.758
DON:
Let's go.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.363
( rock music playing )

20:40.072 --> 20:41.708
All right, he's here.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.810
Back room, southeast corner.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.978
So, how many inside?

20:46.012 --> 20:47.514
15 plus the bartender.

20:47.547 --> 20:50.383
All right, heads up,
everybody. He's here.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.386
Our guy is inside, back
room, southeast corner.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.721
You're gonna stand by.
Repeat: stand by.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.389
How many out back?

20:56.423 --> 20:58.591
A couple of LAPD
plainclothes.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.460
Bar closes
in about an hour.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.395
Less civilians
if things go south.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.696
Yeah. You're right.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.898
All right, listen up,
we're gonna hold here.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.066
Maintain surveillance.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.668
Repeat: maintain
surveillance.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.437
POLICEMAN:
Copy that.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.475
( gunshots )
What was that?

21:15.508 --> 21:17.477
- Shots fired.
- Shots fired. Shots fired.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.511
Go, go, go!
( screaming )

21:18.545 --> 21:20.413
( gunshots )

21:20.447 --> 21:23.316
( clamoring voices )

21:24.751 --> 21:25.985
DON:
FBI!

21:26.018 --> 21:27.520
FBI!

21:27.554 --> 21:29.756
( Cooper shouting )

21:29.789 --> 21:31.758
(sirens wailing,
tires squealing )

21:31.791 --> 21:33.493
- Whoa, hang on, man.
- Where is he?

21:33.526 --> 21:34.494
Where'd he go?

21:34.527 --> 21:35.328
I don't know. I didn't see him.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.396
He got away.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.630
What do you mean,
he got away?

21:37.664 --> 21:39.332
I made entry,
McDowd drew his weapon.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.100
I had no choice
but to open fire.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.336
You made entry? I had command!
I said maintain surveillance.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.972
- I didn't get that.
- We had him, you moron!

21:46.005 --> 21:48.675
Must have been on
a different tac frequency!

21:48.708 --> 21:50.377
He harms anyone--
you understand me,

21:50.410 --> 21:52.345
touches anyone--
it's on your head.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.089
Okay, thanks.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.724
Anything?

22:04.757 --> 22:06.092
Not yet.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.060
Come on, Don,
you know how it works:

22:08.094 --> 22:10.029
things don't always,
you know, pop right away.

22:10.062 --> 22:10.963
Everything was popping

22:10.997 --> 22:13.065
just fine till that idiot Reed
showed up.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.467
I asked around
about him.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.603
He has a reputation
for playing things

22:16.636 --> 22:18.070
a little fast and loose.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.373
Well, you know what, sometimes
that's not a bad thing.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.441
So what do you say

22:21.474 --> 22:22.842
you and I go bust some heads?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.611
Let McDowd's people
know there's not gonna

22:24.644 --> 22:26.679
be any rest for the wicked
till someone gives him up.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.114
DAVID:
Bust some heads?

22:28.147 --> 22:30.550
You really think
you can scare McDowd's folks

22:30.583 --> 22:33.953
more than McDowd
already has?

22:33.986 --> 22:36.423
Well, you know, it's better
than sitting on our asses.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.591
The tips we got
nearly paid off.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.026
Don, we had this guy

22:40.059 --> 22:41.394
at the bar, okay?

22:41.428 --> 22:42.429
We're gonna
get him again.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.663
Is this how you roll now?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.798
Look, back off, Coop-- I got
a witness here to think about.

22:45.832 --> 22:46.799
I'm not taking any chances.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.976
( Charlie sighs )

22:58.110 --> 22:59.979
You know,

23:00.012 --> 23:02.549
I'm sensing a growing level
of frustration here.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.851
I think you better step outside,
get some air...

23:04.884 --> 23:07.019
( sighs )
...maybe let the problem

23:07.053 --> 23:07.987
percolate a little.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.856
Percolating is not gonna solve

23:09.889 --> 23:11.691
the central dilemma here, Larry.

23:11.724 --> 23:12.859
Well, what is it?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.127
I'm trying to map out

23:15.161 --> 23:16.596
McDowd's movements.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.766
McDowd-- he would be
our fugitive, huh?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.968
The yellow dots are unsolved or
uncredited crimes

23:22.001 --> 23:24.070
that have occurred
since the bus crash.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.005
Crimes possibly
committed by McDowd.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.840
But those aren't the problems.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.576
The problems are the blue dots.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.578
Sightings of McDowd
called in

23:31.611 --> 23:33.446
to LAPD and FBI tip lines.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.582
Each dot is a time and a place,

23:35.615 --> 23:36.816
but there are...

23:36.849 --> 23:38.084
there are hundreds of them.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.119
Okay, so the problem
is too much data.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.088
The problem is corrupt data,
Larry, fictitious data.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.122
Here, look.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.156
9:00 a.m.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.492
Right? 9:00 a.m.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.193
McDowd is sighted in three

23:47.226 --> 23:49.529
separate locations, miles apart.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.997
Okay, okay,
so the public,

23:51.030 --> 23:53.733
however well-meaning,
is actually hampering the search

23:53.766 --> 23:55.034
by calling in
too many sightings.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.636
Unless this man
has the ability

23:56.669 --> 23:58.004
to be in three
places at once.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.507
Hey... that's not
entirely impossible.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.908
I mean, quantum theory

24:01.941 --> 24:03.510
does state...

24:03.543 --> 24:04.911
Okay.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.913
Well, for the purposes
of this discussion,

24:06.946 --> 24:08.848
I'll concede the point.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.055
Why are you staring at me?

24:16.088 --> 24:18.257
Because...

24:18.290 --> 24:20.059
we're on to something.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.229
McDowd cannot be
in three places at once.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.665
However, if we analyze

24:25.698 --> 24:27.700
those incompatibilities...

24:27.734 --> 24:28.868
Okay, okay, okay.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.637
So we would use
Bayesian analysis to...

24:30.670 --> 24:33.172
To graph the most recent cluster
of sightings

24:33.205 --> 24:36.976
to determine which of those
sightings are most likely true.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.749
( indistinct voices )

24:42.782 --> 24:44.584
DON:
Dr. Fisher.

24:44.617 --> 24:47.019
Agent Eppes, are
you always on duty?

24:47.053 --> 24:48.655
Well, hey, look
who's talking here.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.057
Yeah, well, I'm
almost off, finally.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.759
You checking up on me?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.260
No.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.029
What? What is it?
What's wrong?

24:57.063 --> 24:58.798
You're gonna have
to go into protection.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.567
Okay, I-I thought
we had this conversation,

25:00.600 --> 25:01.901
and that I'd made myself clear.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.002
Karen, listen to me.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.638
You asked if we had
anything specific, and we do.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.073
The guy who escaped

25:07.106 --> 25:09.809
with McDowd said he is in fact
after someone.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.712
But the policeman said

25:12.745 --> 25:14.781
you-you spotted him,
that you had him.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.215
Right. We did.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.550
Okay, I'm sorry,
I-I don't know

25:17.584 --> 25:19.051
what to tell you,
but he got away.

25:19.085 --> 25:19.986
But nothing is gonna
happen to you,

25:20.019 --> 25:21.754
and we're not gonna
let him get to you.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.090
But you got
to trust me now, okay?

25:24.123 --> 25:26.626
Please. It's just like
your patients do with you.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.996
Okay.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.315
CHARLIE:
Most people believe

25:49.348 --> 25:51.317
that they can trust
their instincts.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.920
However, math suggests

25:53.953 --> 25:56.555
that our instincts
aren't always correct.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.258
We're gonna play a little game.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.226
I want you all

26:00.259 --> 26:03.863
to pretend that we're
on a game show, and

26:03.896 --> 26:05.998
I'm your cheesy game show host.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.967
( laughter )

26:08.000 --> 26:11.103
And behind one of these cards
is a brand new automobile.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.640
And behind the
other two are goats.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.874
Yeah,

26:14.907 --> 26:16.042
goats.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.777
Now, I need a volunteer.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.211
Uh...

26:19.245 --> 26:21.781
come on, more of you than that.
Come on.

26:21.814 --> 26:22.682
Julie.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.316
Why don't you pick
one of these cards?

26:24.350 --> 26:26.619
Remembering of course,
the object is to win the car,

26:26.653 --> 26:27.687
not the goat.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.790
I'll take the one
in the middle.

26:30.823 --> 26:31.824
She takes the middle card.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.927
And what are the chances

26:34.961 --> 26:37.096
that that card
is the winning card?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.965
One in three.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.867
Three choices, one car, right?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.869
One in three, it's
simple enough, right?

26:42.902 --> 26:44.904
Now, here's where
the game's gonna take a turn.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.739
I'm going to reveal to you
one of the cards

26:46.773 --> 26:47.707
that you did not choose.

26:47.740 --> 26:51.343
So, we have two cards
yet to be revealed.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.245
Now, knowing what
you know, do you

26:53.279 --> 26:54.313
want to switch
your choice?

26:54.346 --> 26:55.314
or, more
importantly,

26:55.347 --> 26:57.049
for the purposes of this class,

26:57.083 --> 26:58.050
does it matter?

26:58.084 --> 27:00.286
Will switching
your choice

27:00.319 --> 27:01.988
improve your chances of winning?

27:02.021 --> 27:04.223
Well, no. Because now, two
cards... it's 50-50, right?

27:04.256 --> 27:06.358
How many people agree with her?

27:10.997 --> 27:13.299
That's what your instinct
tells you, but you'd be wrong.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.702
Switching your cards

27:15.735 --> 27:16.635
at this point actually

27:16.669 --> 27:19.005
doubles your chances
of winning the car.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.309
How?

27:23.342 --> 27:27.113
Well, since we started out
with two goats,

27:27.146 --> 27:28.681
It's more likely

27:28.715 --> 27:31.017
that your first choice
was a goat.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.020
What are the odds
of choosing the goat?

27:34.053 --> 27:36.122
Two out of three.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.691
Right. So it's more likely
that this is a goat,

27:38.725 --> 27:40.259
less likely that it's a car,

27:40.292 --> 27:43.129
and it's more likely that
this card is a car.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.932
See, switching your
choice gives you

27:45.965 --> 27:48.167
a two-out-of-three
chance of winning the car,

27:48.200 --> 27:51.337
rather than the one-out-of-three
chance that we all began with.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.272
( students murmuring )

27:53.305 --> 27:54.340
Vroom, vroom.

27:54.373 --> 27:55.908
All right.
You won

27:55.942 --> 27:58.210
a car, Julie.
Congratulations.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.779
All right. Well, you know what?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.814
I think...
Yeah, yeah, we're out of time.

28:01.848 --> 28:02.614
So, uh, go home,

28:02.648 --> 28:04.316
make some of these
for yourselves,

28:04.350 --> 28:07.253
Put together some
reasonable "n" samples,

28:07.286 --> 28:09.121
and, uh... yeah,
see what happens.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.990
I'll see you all
next week. Thanks.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.162
Hi, Dad. What are
you doing here?

28:16.195 --> 28:18.264
Oh, I like coming
whenever Charlie

28:18.297 --> 28:19.832
gives one of these
math-for-dummies lectures.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.433
It's the only time
I actually understand

28:21.467 --> 28:23.235
what he's talking about.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.070
This is Billy Cooper.

28:24.103 --> 28:24.937
- He's an agent I work with.
- Hi.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.339
- Sir.
- We've met before, haven't we?

28:27.373 --> 28:29.275
Oh, yeah.
I couldn't remember...

28:29.308 --> 28:30.943
You worked a case
with Don out here once?

28:30.977 --> 28:32.044
Back in the day,
yes, sir.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.412
Yeah.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.414
Donny, can I talk

28:35.447 --> 28:36.248
to you for a minute?

28:36.282 --> 28:38.050
Yeah, sure.
Just give me a second.

28:38.084 --> 28:38.985
Yeah.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.522
Um, w-what-what are you
doing? What's going on?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.057
What are you
talking about?

28:45.091 --> 28:46.759
Well, I-I haven't
seen you for days.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.760
I'm working.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.295
Yeah, I know,
Charlie told me.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.997
Are you going back
to manhunting now?

28:51.030 --> 28:52.999
Oh, I see. Dad, come on.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.500
- Hmm?
- Don't. This is one case.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.335
I seem to recall
your saying that

28:56.368 --> 28:57.970
about only one case once before,

28:58.004 --> 28:59.371
but, if you remember,
they were not

28:59.405 --> 29:00.907
good days for
you, or for me.

29:00.940 --> 29:01.874
Yeah.

29:01.908 --> 29:02.842
I mean, we didn't hear
from you for weeks.

29:02.875 --> 29:03.575
We didn't even know
where the hell you were.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.444
- Dad...
- You do realize that

29:05.477 --> 29:06.345
chasing after someone

29:06.378 --> 29:08.447
you could be running
away from yourself

29:08.480 --> 29:10.016
at the same time.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.183
Hey, thanks for coming down.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.218
Yeah, we just
got here.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.385
- What's up?
- Hey, Charlie.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.954
- What'd you think?
- Oh, I loved it.

29:14.987 --> 29:15.788
- I loved it. Yeah.
- Yeah?

29:15.822 --> 29:17.423
- It was great.
- You weren't bored?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.058
Bored? No, no, no.
Are you kidding?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.459
I can go out
and win a goat,

29:20.492 --> 29:22.161
or a car if I'm lucky.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.529
Well, anyway,

29:23.562 --> 29:25.431
I guess you guys
have something to talk

29:25.464 --> 29:26.432
to each other
about, so I'll

29:26.465 --> 29:27.433
see you at
home, okay?

29:27.466 --> 29:29.201
Both of you, hmm?

29:31.303 --> 29:32.271
What have you got?

29:32.304 --> 29:34.473
This is the map you guys
have been working from.

29:34.506 --> 29:35.507
It details every sighting,

29:35.541 --> 29:37.443
every phone tip concerning

29:37.476 --> 29:38.577
McDowd's whereabouts

29:38.610 --> 29:40.079
over the last
36 hours.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.080
And what's that one?

29:41.113 --> 29:43.382
This is from my algorithm.
I tried to filter

29:43.415 --> 29:46.518
the good tips from the bad
tips, at least try to target

29:46.552 --> 29:48.855
those with the greater
probability of accuracy.

29:48.888 --> 29:49.856
And all this

29:49.889 --> 29:50.990
gives us what?

29:51.023 --> 29:53.092
McDowd's actual
movements. You see,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.862
these dots represent not only
places, but times as well,

29:55.895 --> 29:57.496
so if we're
working sequentially,

29:57.529 --> 30:00.032
we can follow him from here
to here to here to here.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.003
So, where he's been and
where he's possibly headed.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.105
That's exactly right.
The only problem is,

30:06.138 --> 30:08.507
these movements are not
in McDowd's known territory.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.315
To me, it looks like
he's moving in circles, right?

30:16.348 --> 30:17.416
Actually,
this pattern

30:17.449 --> 30:19.818
is a series
of concentric circles.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.455
- They're almost like...
- Almost like

30:23.489 --> 30:25.457
he's hunting.

30:29.428 --> 30:32.164
The pattern is similar
to ones that carnivores use

30:32.198 --> 30:33.165
to stalk large prey.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.433
Can we narrow
this even more?

30:34.466 --> 30:35.434
I want to look at

30:35.467 --> 30:36.502
the movements
that are within

30:36.535 --> 30:37.436
the hunting pattern.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.338
Like he's looking
for the medical clinic?

30:39.371 --> 30:40.506
Yeah, and maybe

30:40.539 --> 30:41.507
the witness's
house.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.142
Well, okay. If we eliminate

30:43.175 --> 30:46.078
the movements not connected
to this pattern...

30:47.346 --> 30:48.514
...then the movements

30:48.547 --> 30:50.216
become confined

30:50.249 --> 30:52.051
to this area right here.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.259
You know what?
That's Zee-Boys' territory.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.493
- Zee-Boys?
- Yeah.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.594
It's this Asian gang.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.231
I mean, drugs, gun-running,
the whole nine yards.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.298
Yeah, but
this area has

31:06.332 --> 31:08.467
nothing to do with the witness,
so who's he after?

31:08.500 --> 31:09.535
The gang's run by this character

31:09.568 --> 31:11.537
named Romeo Choi,
I mean, a real piece of work.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.905
DEA's been after
him, but they

31:12.939 --> 31:14.140
haven't been
able to make a case.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.574
- Hmm.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.376
What is it?

31:24.283 --> 31:26.585
I think there's a shipping depot
here that's supposed to be

31:26.618 --> 31:27.586
a front for the Zee-Boys.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.922
You think Choi's McDowd's
target? Could be.

31:29.956 --> 31:34.460
You said DEA's been
after Choi for a while.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.495
Yeah, but they've just been
banging their heads

31:36.528 --> 31:37.596
against a wall.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.498
You smell that?

31:39.531 --> 31:42.534
Yeah. Someone
fired a gun?

31:42.568 --> 31:45.204
More than once.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.377
Still warm.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.680
If this is McDowd's work...

31:54.713 --> 31:56.115
We must have just missed him.

32:02.454 --> 32:04.957
I've been through every file
on McDowd and Choi.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.525
And there's nothing
that links them together.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.593
DON:
Well, there's got to be.

32:07.626 --> 32:08.294
He was hunting him.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.695
Maybe it was
a power-grab.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.363
Maybe McDowd's trying
to take over

32:11.397 --> 32:13.365
Choi's drug operation.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.001
Zee-Boys got a long chain
of command.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.368
No way McDowd just steps in.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.504
Okay, so maybe McDowd's
working with somebody else.

32:18.537 --> 32:21.040
I mean, the guy was
a contract killer.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.108
All right.

32:22.141 --> 32:25.444
Look, let's just break it down.

32:25.477 --> 32:26.378
We got the bus
accident.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.047
We got the gardener
and the truck driver

32:28.080 --> 32:28.981
in on it.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.549
Now, I say there's
got to be more players.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.152
Someone had to know
McDowd was being transferred.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.186
Someone had to.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.754
Donnie, anyone with
that kind of information's

32:35.787 --> 32:38.590
working on the inside,
and it's a long list.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.592
Prison officials,

32:40.626 --> 32:42.761
- corrections officers.
- Well, according to this,

32:42.794 --> 32:45.264
McDowd and Williams
are in the fourth row.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.765
All right, Williams
against the window.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.401
McDowd is across the aisle.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.337
All right, say you're
McDowd over here.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.704
What are you thinking?

32:52.738 --> 32:54.306
That's Williams.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.375
I mean, we've
been assuming...

32:56.408 --> 32:58.477
that he freed himself
with the guard's keys.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.745
Yeah, after he shot him.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.748
But you're McDowd,
and I'm the guard.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.417
There's no way
I can reach your gun.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.719
Not unless your hands
are already free.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.089
DON:
That your signature?

33:10.122 --> 33:11.257
What about it?

33:11.290 --> 33:14.360
Got six prisoners processed
and secured for transfer?

33:14.393 --> 33:15.227
Yeah, that's right.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.063
Only they weren't secured,
were they?

33:17.096 --> 33:19.565
At least not McDowd.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.667
Look, I-I don't, I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.669
Hey, what we're talking about
is the fact that

33:23.702 --> 33:26.072
McDowd was able to get the gun
away from the Marshal

33:26.105 --> 33:27.806
and kill him with it, that's
what we're talking about.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.675
See, the problem is that McDowd

33:29.708 --> 33:31.377
was supposed to be shackled
at the time.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.512
The, the chain must've broke

33:33.545 --> 33:35.247
- during the crash.
- It didn't.

33:35.281 --> 33:36.115
We checked.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.649
And the thing I can't
reconcile with--

33:37.683 --> 33:38.717
because I looked
in your file, Raynor--

33:38.750 --> 33:41.087
I mean, you got 15 years,
positive performance.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.554
You're gonna help
someone like McDowd?

33:42.588 --> 33:44.090
What, are you
strapped for cash?

33:44.123 --> 33:46.425
Huh? Some gangbanger
threaten your life?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.793
Which doesn't matter,
'cause either way,

33:47.826 --> 33:48.860
you're looking at
a murder conspiracy.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.662
And I know you know
what I'm talking about here.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.464
We want your cooperation.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.532
You give it to us, we make sure

33:53.565 --> 33:55.067
the U.S. attorney
knows about it.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.835
Otherwise we toss you over

33:56.868 --> 33:59.505
to the guys
you've been guarding.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.611
( sighs )

34:05.644 --> 34:07.279
He arrested my brother.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.148
Who arrested your brother?

34:09.181 --> 34:11.117
He planted evidence.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.718
A drug charge.

34:12.751 --> 34:13.785
But who're they gonna believe?

34:13.819 --> 34:15.787
If he wanted to send
my little brother to prison,

34:15.821 --> 34:17.256
- he could do it.
- Wait, hold on...

34:17.289 --> 34:18.324
I've seen it done before.

34:18.357 --> 34:19.225
Ho-Hold on.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.826
Just back up now.
What are we talking

34:20.859 --> 34:22.094
about here, Raynor?

34:22.128 --> 34:24.230
LAPD.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.764
Detective Reed.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.203
So Reed frees McDowd.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.671
McDowd kills Choi.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.306
There's got to be
a connection there.

34:34.340 --> 34:35.407
DAVID:
There is.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.743
DEA just turned Choi as
an informant six weeks ago.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.145
Well, there it is.

34:39.178 --> 34:40.346
Choi was cooperating?

34:40.379 --> 34:41.813
Yep, and apparently
Reed's name came up

34:41.847 --> 34:43.649
in some of Choi's
debriefing sessions.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.517
The DEA was just starting
to look into Reed.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.552
So Reed finds out

34:46.585 --> 34:47.653
Choi's gonna make him dirty,

34:47.686 --> 34:48.520
gets McDowd out to kill Choi.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.522
- Yep.
- Reed was investigating McDowd.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.224
They definitely
have a relationship.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.793
What does McDowd get in
return for killing Choi?

34:54.826 --> 34:56.528
Isn't his freedom enough?

34:56.562 --> 34:57.796
No, Reed's too smart
for that.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.265
He's gonna hold something back

34:59.298 --> 35:00.766
to guarantee
that McDowd'll deliver.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.800
He's right.
If McDowd's free,

35:01.833 --> 35:03.669
he could just disappear.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.638
There's Karen.
It's the witness.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.607
- We got her in a safe house.
- No, Reed's unit

35:08.640 --> 35:10.609
would definitely
be part of that DEA task force.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.211
He'd have access
to the Fed's database.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.645
We got to get to
that safe house.

35:29.728 --> 35:30.729
He's alive.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.298
We got an agent down.
( man yells )

35:32.331 --> 35:33.665
Go that way.
( woman cries )

35:34.766 --> 35:36.635
Shut up, Karen!
( cries )

35:38.570 --> 35:39.605
DON:
FBI!

35:39.638 --> 35:40.672
( cries ):
Please help me!

35:41.973 --> 35:43.542
Let her go, McDowd!

35:47.846 --> 35:48.780
( screams )

35:48.814 --> 35:51.350
Get in the room, lock the door!

35:51.383 --> 35:54.286
Coop, he's heading to the roof!

36:26.318 --> 36:28.287
( panting )

36:31.790 --> 36:34.693
You move, there's a hole in your
head, you understand me?

36:34.726 --> 36:35.794
You might as well shoot.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.729
I'm already dead.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.741
He could just
fall off the roof.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.877
Save your witness
a bunch of sleepless nights.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.880
You'll never change.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.318
You could at least grab his gun.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.289
( sighs heavily )

37:05.891 --> 37:06.725
Thanks.

37:06.758 --> 37:07.893
It'll just be
a few more minutes...

37:07.926 --> 37:09.628
Hey.

37:09.661 --> 37:10.896
How you doing?

37:10.929 --> 37:13.265
I'm, um... I'm okay.

37:13.299 --> 37:13.999
Yeah? You're sure?

37:14.032 --> 37:15.634
Yeah.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.768
How about you?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.370
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.439
You should really get
that looked at, you know.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.740
Oh, right.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.842
You don't know a doctor
by any chance, do you?

37:23.875 --> 37:25.611
I might.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.913
Donnie, we got
eyeballs on Reed.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.348
Okay. I got to go.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.350
We'll make sure we get
you home now, okay?

37:31.383 --> 37:32.418
Hey, Siegel!

37:32.451 --> 37:33.852
- Yo! Okay.
- Take care.

37:33.885 --> 37:34.720
Okay.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.855
Hey, Agent Eppes...

37:36.888 --> 37:37.956
Thanks.

37:43.929 --> 37:44.963
Okay, there
you go, man.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.298
Gracias.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.165
DON:
Don't move, Reed.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.467
- Drop the bags.
- What the hell is...?

37:48.500 --> 37:49.801
Drop the bags!
Get your hands up.

37:49.835 --> 37:50.702
Get 'em up!

37:53.071 --> 37:55.707
Ah, come on, who do you think
they're gonna believe?

37:55.741 --> 37:57.743
A convicted murderer
or a decorated cop?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.645
My money's on the convict.

37:59.678 --> 38:00.746
Give me your hands.
Turn around.

38:04.015 --> 38:04.916
Let's go.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.421
Hey.

38:09.455 --> 38:10.922
So, you're out of here?

38:10.956 --> 38:12.524
Heading to Phoenix.

38:12.558 --> 38:14.393
Meth tweaker I been chasing.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.994
No chance we can get you
to stick around,

38:16.027 --> 38:17.796
maybe put in for a position
around here?

38:17.829 --> 38:19.798
What, and settle down?

38:19.831 --> 38:21.467
Hey...

38:21.500 --> 38:23.735
It's not bad, Coop,
I got to tell you.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.871
You don't miss it?

38:25.904 --> 38:28.574
No. Not really, no.

38:28.607 --> 38:32.110
The rush you get when
you're hauling his ass in...

38:32.143 --> 38:34.546
Your fugitive's
a couple hours ahead of you

38:34.580 --> 38:36.348
and you're closing ground.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.384
All right, maybe a little.

38:38.417 --> 38:40.952
Hey, but not being in touch
with my family,

38:40.986 --> 38:44.656
not being able to talk to
anybody, I don't miss that.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.993
I don't know,
I think L.A.'s good for me.

38:48.026 --> 38:51.530
Well...

38:51.563 --> 38:53.331
that's a good thing.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.835
Keep your head down, huh?

38:56.868 --> 38:57.969
I'll do that.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.978
- It's the rook.
- Right.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.383
It's not too distracting
for you, is it, Charlie...

39:11.417 --> 39:12.418
Yeah, Charlie.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.885
...you working

39:13.919 --> 39:15.120
and playing chess
at the same time?

39:15.153 --> 39:16.788
Me? I'm fine.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.790
It's not me you guys
need to be worried about.

39:18.824 --> 39:19.958
Okay.
We'll see about that.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.593
- Mm-hmm.
- Gentlemen...

39:21.627 --> 39:22.794
winning isn't everything.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.995
DON:
Oh, since when?

39:24.029 --> 39:25.997
No, no, come on, come on. You!
Winning isn't everything.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.098
Since you guys

39:27.132 --> 39:28.634
never win.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.001
Come on, who cares
who wins?

39:30.035 --> 39:31.069
It's about having fun.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.938
You know, being together
and talking to each other

39:32.971 --> 39:34.840
and, uh, having
a little face time.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.578
Okay, Charlie.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.850
Yeah, and by the way,
"anomaly" has only one "O,"

39:44.883 --> 39:46.017
Charlie.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.118
- What?
- Yeah.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.954
It's all right.
It's your move.

39:48.987 --> 39:51.423
You know what, do me a favor,
leave me alone, okay?

39:51.457 --> 39:54.426
I use that word in math
every single day, okay?

39:54.460 --> 39:55.694
I can spell that word.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.162
We know that you know
how to use it, but

39:57.195 --> 39:58.730
you certainly don't
know how to spell it.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.899
It's "a-l-y," not "o-l-y."

40:00.932 --> 40:03.969
And by the way,
it's your turn again, Charlie.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.905
I know how to spell
the word "anomaly," okay?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.206
No, you don't.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.008
Get a dictionary.

40:10.041 --> 40:10.776
Right now,
get a dictionary.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.911
I think you better.
All right.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.013
You know how many times
I use that word in a day,

40:15.046 --> 40:15.914
every day?

40:15.947 --> 40:18.550
No, but I do know
that it's your turn.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.118
My turn? All right, here.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.152
- Very nice.
- I see the word.

40:21.186 --> 40:21.987
Here you go.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.522
There's no way that...

40:23.555 --> 40:26.825
DON:
That would be one "O."

40:28.794 --> 40:30.496
Is this a reliable dictionary?

40:30.529 --> 40:31.563
( scoffs )

40:31.597 --> 40:32.498
Come on, Charlie.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.465
I can't believe that.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.233
Well, you better believe it.
And guess what?

40:35.266 --> 40:35.901
What?

40:36.902 --> 40:38.770
ALAN:
Checkmate.

40:38.804 --> 40:39.705
Checkmate.

40:39.738 --> 40:40.772
Oh...

40:40.806 --> 40:42.007
Yeah, I see.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.174
You guys are ganging
up on me, huh?

40:43.208 --> 40:44.476
What, you did that
on purpose,

40:44.510 --> 40:45.877
that little distraction
thing, huh?

40:45.911 --> 40:46.945
- Oh, come on, Charlie.
- That's good.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.114
Chess is... not just about
moving pieces, you know.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.115
Well, you know what?
( phone rings )

40:50.148 --> 40:52.117
This is the last game.
I'm not playing anymore.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.019
- Oh, come on!
- Eppes.

40:54.052 --> 40:54.886
( chuckling )

40:54.920 --> 40:57.022
All right, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.824
All right, guys, sorry.
Hate to win and run,

40:58.857 --> 41:00.592
but I got to go.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.928
- Didn't you just get off work?
- Now I'm back on.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.864
Well, I guess you got to do
what you got to do.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.132
Sorry.
Look, I'll call you guys later.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.067
Maybe we'll grab a
bite to eat, all right?

41:09.100 --> 41:09.768
- Right.
- Yeah, don't worry.

41:09.801 --> 41:10.969
I'll take care of the old man

41:11.002 --> 41:11.870
while you're gone.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.972
- All right, see you, guys.
- See ya.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.273
"Old man?"

41:15.306 --> 41:19.110
I use it strictly
as a term of endearment, Father.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.980
Well, you better prepare
yourself, my little boy,

41:22.013 --> 41:24.516
because this old man's
gonna kick your ass.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.350
Oh, yeah?

41:25.383 --> 41:26.852
What, are you going
to cheat again?

41:26.885 --> 41:27.686
No.

41:27.719 --> 41:28.754
I'm going to get
the Scrabble board.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.290
( stammers )
S... uh...

41:32.323 --> 41:32.390
Scrabble's missing a piece.
