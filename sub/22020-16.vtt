WEBVTT

00:08.273 --> 00:09.776
Hey, Antonio.

00:09.808 --> 00:11.244
Hey!

00:11.276 --> 00:13.112
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:13.145 --> 00:14.346
Sorry.

00:14.379 --> 00:16.148
Are you okay?

00:16.181 --> 00:17.317
Yeah, yeah.

00:17.373 --> 00:18.978
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Good.

00:19.003 --> 00:20.753
- You good?
- Good, yeah, all good.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.721
- Yeah.
- Are you going in?

00:22.755 --> 00:24.924
Good, me too.

00:24.956 --> 00:26.926
- Should we walk?
- Yeah.

00:26.959 --> 00:28.195
Okay.

00:30.059 --> 00:32.261
Well I for one am very glad
that we can be together

00:32.293 --> 00:33.931
and it's not awkward.

00:35.431 --> 00:36.899
Are you here for Platt's thing?

00:36.932 --> 00:38.144
'Cause I've never seen Mouch so excited

00:38.168 --> 00:39.536
about anything in his whole life.

00:39.568 --> 00:41.572
He made a cinnamon roll casserole
for the occasion.

00:41.605 --> 00:43.239
What the hell's that?

00:43.273 --> 00:45.876
What's the big deal, man?
Just do me this favor.

00:45.909 --> 00:48.579
I'm not live tweeting
a threeminute conversation.

00:48.611 --> 00:50.913
It's a threeminute conversation.

00:50.946 --> 00:52.983
Local access, Mouch, I mean...

00:53.016 --> 00:54.493
Who do you propose
is going to be tuning in

00:54.517 --> 00:55.551
for these live tweets?

00:55.584 --> 00:57.119
What are you doing here?

00:57.153 --> 00:58.898
I thought PD was having
their own viewing party.

00:58.922 --> 01:00.190
She's on in 30 minutes.

01:00.223 --> 01:01.992
As much as I love Trudy.
I'm here for Eva.

01:02.025 --> 01:04.060
- You guys seen her?
- She's down there with Gabby.

01:04.093 --> 01:07.063
Third door on the left.

01:07.096 --> 01:08.197
There you go, Rapunzel.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.498
Get your stuff. We're going.

01:09.532 --> 01:11.000
What? Why?

01:11.033 --> 01:12.211
You said I could hang
with Aunt Gabby all day.

01:12.235 --> 01:13.604
Yeah, she can. She's fine.

01:13.637 --> 01:15.205
You're not staying. You're grounded.

01:15.238 --> 01:16.873
No more phone. No social media.

01:16.907 --> 01:19.310
- Let's go.
- What? What did I do?

01:24.480 --> 01:26.182
All right, that's not
what it looks like.

01:26.215 --> 01:27.950
- I can explain.
- Is that not your profile?

01:27.983 --> 01:29.920
- No, it is, but it's not...
- Under a fake name

01:29.952 --> 01:31.520
- so I can't monitor it.
- No.

01:31.554 --> 01:33.123
It's just a second account.

01:33.155 --> 01:34.533
It's the one I use at my friends...

01:34.557 --> 01:36.626
It's the account where
you posted a dozen pictures

01:36.660 --> 01:38.595
of yourself partying and drinking.

01:38.628 --> 01:41.164
I did not post any of those.

01:41.197 --> 01:44.034
- Last weekend... Hey!
- That was...

01:44.066 --> 01:45.669
Last weekend when you told me

01:45.702 --> 01:49.072
you were studying late at Taryn's house.

01:49.104 --> 01:51.974
- Did you not tell me that?
- I...

01:52.007 --> 01:54.010
Go get your stuff.

01:54.643 --> 01:57.113
Don't look at her. Go.

01:58.148 --> 02:00.517
Eva, give me your phone.

02:04.086 --> 02:06.122
You know you look just like Dad, right?

02:06.155 --> 02:08.190
You even got that
forehead vein thing going.

02:08.223 --> 02:09.459
That's papa.

02:11.427 --> 02:13.029
Come on. Let's go.

02:14.431 --> 02:16.132
Later, Eva.

02:16.165 --> 02:18.534
Every single person
I know has two profiles.

02:18.568 --> 02:20.003
It's just for privacy.

02:20.035 --> 02:21.538
That's not privacy. That's hiding.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.648
You're making those photos
into something they're not.

02:23.672 --> 02:25.207
You can't trust the Internet, Dad.

02:25.241 --> 02:26.944
It always looks worse than it is.

02:26.976 --> 02:29.313
If you would just
let me explain it to you

02:29.345 --> 02:31.682
instead of you seizing
my phone without cause.

02:31.714 --> 02:33.983
Platt's on in two. Everyone! Adam!

02:34.016 --> 02:35.618
- Antonio, come on.
- We're not staying.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.028
I'm gonna do the paperwork at home.

02:37.052 --> 02:38.421
Hey, Eva. What's up, kid?

02:38.455 --> 02:39.989
My father's a fascist.

02:40.022 --> 02:42.358
Okay, I don't know what to do with that.

02:42.391 --> 02:44.360
Okay, everybody be quiet.

02:44.393 --> 02:45.361
Platt's on TV.

02:45.395 --> 02:47.130
Betty's sitting down to discuss

02:47.163 --> 02:48.432
the new friendly face

02:48.464 --> 02:49.533
of the Chicago PD

02:49.565 --> 02:51.033
with Sergeant Trudy Platt.

02:51.066 --> 02:52.143
- What friendly face is that?
- Betty.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.369
Thank you, Sheri.

02:53.403 --> 02:55.304
I'm so excited to be here today

02:55.338 --> 02:58.241
with Sergeant Trudy Platt
from the 21st District...

02:58.273 --> 03:00.242
She couldn't possibly
hate this any more.

03:00.276 --> 03:02.244
Thank you so much
for coming this morning.

03:02.278 --> 03:05.282
It's my pleasure.
I'm hap... I'm happy to be here.

03:05.314 --> 03:07.483
This is like Christmas.

03:07.516 --> 03:09.618
Those photos don't show
what you think they do.

03:09.652 --> 03:12.221
Okay, we did go to Taryn's
house, and then we got a call

03:12.255 --> 03:14.291
- from Becca that she needed...
- Eva, stop!

03:14.324 --> 03:15.667
You put your whole life on that thing.

03:15.691 --> 03:17.027
I don't need you to explain.

03:17.059 --> 03:18.270
I can see exactly what you're doing

03:18.294 --> 03:20.330
and who you are. And you know what?

03:20.362 --> 03:22.199
I don't like
who you've become very much.

03:22.231 --> 03:24.266
In the neighborhoods that they serve.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.403
Combating crime problems together

03:26.435 --> 03:28.571
along with...

03:28.605 --> 03:31.340
- Is everything okay?
- I think that's coming

03:31.374 --> 03:34.344
- from my office.
- What was that?

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.673 --> 04:06.176
Hey, Officer.

04:06.208 --> 04:07.810
Sergeant Hank Voight.

04:07.844 --> 04:09.346
There's no command post set yet?

04:09.379 --> 04:11.114
- No, sir. Not yet.
- Okay.

04:11.147 --> 04:12.449
- What's your name?
- Joey.

04:12.481 --> 04:14.151
- Mendez. Officer Mendez.
- Okay, listen.

04:14.183 --> 04:15.718
You know how to set up cordon, Mendez?

04:15.751 --> 04:17.119
All right, good.

04:17.153 --> 04:18.288
I want you to establish it

04:18.321 --> 04:19.755
around a threeblock radius.

04:19.788 --> 04:21.223
No one in or out

04:21.255 --> 04:23.059
- except first responders and victims.
- Yeah.

04:23.093 --> 04:24.302
All right, you set up a holding area.

04:24.326 --> 04:25.538
- Excuse me.
- Get everyone's info.

04:25.562 --> 04:27.264
No one leaves if you don't know 'em.

04:27.297 --> 04:28.832
You got it? Go.

04:28.864 --> 04:31.535
Trudy!

04:31.567 --> 04:32.802
- Trudy!
- Sarge!

04:32.836 --> 04:34.336
Seven minutes since the explosion.

04:34.369 --> 04:36.372
Fire has no reads on gas meters.

04:36.405 --> 04:39.141
And we haven't heard from Platt yet.

05:10.906 --> 05:13.209
Betty? Betty?

05:13.242 --> 05:15.379
Betty.

05:26.889 --> 05:29.292
Sheri?

05:30.893 --> 05:32.761
Sheri? Sheri?

05:32.795 --> 05:34.730
Hey, it's going to be okay.

05:38.701 --> 05:40.437
Sheri. Sheri.

05:41.703 --> 05:44.208
Sheri, stay with me. Come on.

05:49.578 --> 05:51.614
It's okay, Sheri.

06:01.658 --> 06:03.193
The exits are blocked.

06:03.225 --> 06:05.728
We can't get upstairs.

06:05.761 --> 06:07.663
We'll go in here.

06:09.831 --> 06:11.534
Come on.

06:20.742 --> 06:23.480
Sheri, are you still with me?

06:23.513 --> 06:25.382
Sheri.

06:25.415 --> 06:27.384
Come on, girl. Stay with me.

06:46.970 --> 06:48.804
Stay with me, Sheri.

06:52.841 --> 06:54.543
Come on, girl.

06:57.847 --> 06:59.316
Okay, girl.

06:59.348 --> 07:01.985
Breathe. Breathe.

07:32.381 --> 07:34.817
- Breathe, honey.
- Fire department. Call out!

07:36.653 --> 07:38.788
Here!

07:39.855 --> 07:40.990
Here.

07:41.023 --> 07:42.324
Trudy? Trudy.

07:42.357 --> 07:43.386
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

07:43.411 --> 07:44.394
- Get her.
- You okay?

07:44.427 --> 07:46.563
I'm okay. Get her.

07:49.331 --> 07:50.599
- I got her, I got her.
- Okay.

07:50.633 --> 07:52.736
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

07:52.768 --> 07:54.370
- Cruz is right behind me.
- Okay.

07:54.403 --> 07:55.614
He's covering the front entrance.

07:55.638 --> 07:57.007
Okay.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.575
Stay with us, Sheri. Okay.

07:58.607 --> 07:59.884
- Hey, you good to go?
- Yeah, I'm good to go.

07:59.908 --> 08:01.343
- You sure?
- Good to go.

08:01.376 --> 08:02.588
All right, just follow me, stay low.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.014
I'm gonna get you back to Cruz.

08:04.047 --> 08:05.357
He's gonna take you upstairs, okay?

08:05.381 --> 08:06.621
- Yeah.
- All right, let's move.

08:09.052 --> 08:10.886
Stay with us, Sheri. Here we go.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.756
Medic!

08:12.788 --> 08:14.556
I need a medic!

08:14.590 --> 08:15.691
Trudy!

08:16.893 --> 08:18.428
I'm okay.

08:18.461 --> 08:20.062
Sheri's wounds are from bolts and nails.

08:20.095 --> 08:22.280
This was a bombing.
First the timer sounded.

08:22.281 --> 08:24.033
Less than 30 seconds later,
the explosion.

08:24.066 --> 08:26.569
All right, get on the zone.
Get 1800 on the scene.

08:26.602 --> 08:28.713
We need Bomb and Arson sweeping
for secondary devices.

08:28.737 --> 08:29.738
Copy that.

08:29.773 --> 08:31.516
- You sure you're okay?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

08:31.540 --> 08:32.717
- She had a pulse.
- Okay, we got it.

08:32.741 --> 08:34.086
It was steady. She should be okay.

08:34.110 --> 08:35.644
Platt. Platt, Platt! We got it.

08:35.677 --> 08:37.322
- It's fine.
- Sheri, you're gonna be okay.

08:37.346 --> 08:39.283
Trudy!

08:40.883 --> 08:42.852
- What the hell happened?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

08:42.884 --> 08:44.687
- I am. I'm okay.
- Come on, come on.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.922
- Medic! Give me a blanket.
- Yep.

08:46.956 --> 08:48.325
No, ma'am.

08:48.358 --> 08:49.659
Don't try and speak. We got you.

08:49.691 --> 08:52.328
- We're going to the hospital.
- Must talk to...

08:52.361 --> 08:54.063
Don't try and speak.

08:54.096 --> 08:56.533
I won't go.

08:56.566 --> 08:58.401
- Must talk to cop.
- Okay, ma'am, all right.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.035
- We're gonna get you a cop.
- No.

09:00.068 --> 09:01.538
- No.
- Antonio.

09:01.571 --> 09:02.847
- Need a cop!
- She won't let us leave

09:02.871 --> 09:04.549
until she talks to a cop.
We don't have time.

09:04.573 --> 09:06.075
- We got to move.
- I'll come.

09:06.109 --> 09:07.711
No.

09:10.580 --> 09:12.715
Let's go. Let's go.

09:17.119 --> 09:19.121
Ma'am, you understand
that by continuing to speak

09:19.154 --> 09:20.365
you're putting yourself at risk?

09:20.389 --> 09:21.457
I don't recommend it.

09:21.490 --> 09:22.991
- Talk.
- I'm here.

09:23.024 --> 09:24.827
I'm here. I'm here.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.462
I'm Antonio Dawson.

09:26.495 --> 09:28.497
I'm a detective with
the Chicago Police Department.

09:28.531 --> 09:30.467
Listen, we don't have to talk right now.

09:30.499 --> 09:31.835
I want...

09:31.868 --> 09:35.038
I wanna... I want to talk.

09:35.071 --> 09:37.106
Okay, okay. Okay.

09:37.139 --> 09:39.441
There...

09:39.475 --> 09:42.479
was a pa... package...

09:42.512 --> 09:45.114
- for me.
- A package?

09:45.148 --> 09:49.886
I think it was... the... the bomb.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.856
You think there was a bomb
in the package?

09:53.889 --> 09:55.124
For you?

09:55.158 --> 09:59.495
It was delivered to my... my office.

09:59.528 --> 10:01.597
Okay, okay, okay.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.665
I've been threatened.

10:03.698 --> 10:06.502
Do you know who sent it?

10:06.536 --> 10:08.004
Antonio, her heart rate's going up.

10:08.037 --> 10:11.608
No, but there was a man

10:11.640 --> 10:14.176
who I... I've already seen.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.745
- Okay.
- 40s.

10:16.778 --> 10:19.047
Beard. He...

10:19.081 --> 10:20.682
Move.

10:20.715 --> 10:22.485
What can I do? How can I help?

10:22.518 --> 10:23.854
Put pressure on her neck.

10:26.788 --> 10:28.557
There's a lot of blood coming up.

10:28.590 --> 10:31.528
Hey. Hey, Sheri, you hear me?

10:32.094 --> 10:33.930
Sheri? Stay with me, Sheri!

10:37.200 --> 10:39.211
All right, we got the initial
report from Bomb and Arson.

10:39.235 --> 10:40.637
It was a single device.

10:40.669 --> 10:42.038
Cardboard box in Sheri's office.

10:42.071 --> 10:43.639
IED, nails, glass.

10:43.672 --> 10:45.216
We're lucky no one
was standing closer, Sarge.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.143
Sheri was pronounced at Med.

10:47.176 --> 10:48.778
She...

10:48.811 --> 10:50.613
Injuries were too substantial.

10:50.645 --> 10:52.181
Two others are in critical condition,

10:52.215 --> 10:53.917
but they're both suspected
to pull through.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.793
There was a dozen more victims
but as of right now

10:55.817 --> 10:57.696
it looks like Sheri and Betty
are our only fatalities.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.889
That bomb was planted in Sheri's office.

10:59.922 --> 11:01.057
She had to be the target.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.059
She was getting threats too.

11:03.091 --> 11:04.760
We recovered four emails all sent

11:04.793 --> 11:06.228
from an anonymous email account.

11:06.262 --> 11:08.465
Bounced around about a half dozen IPs.

11:08.498 --> 11:09.833
They're all death threats.

11:09.865 --> 11:11.476
"Burn, bitch, burn.
Your days are numbered.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.535
"You will burn." That sort of thing.

11:13.568 --> 11:15.637
All right, so what do
we know about Sheri?

11:15.671 --> 11:17.674
She's 26 years old, Northwestern grad,

11:17.706 --> 11:19.609
started working
for the station as an intern.

11:19.642 --> 11:20.952
She'd been on the air for two months.

11:20.976 --> 11:23.545
Single, wellliked.
Al's with the family.

11:23.579 --> 11:25.014
Trying to track the package.

11:25.047 --> 11:26.850
Cameras at the entrances of the building

11:26.883 --> 11:28.785
only captured a man from behind.

11:28.817 --> 11:32.087
It's not much, but given that
and what Sheri gave us

11:32.120 --> 11:34.923
I pulled these pod photos.

11:34.956 --> 11:37.559
Could be the same guy

11:37.592 --> 11:39.528
if he ditches the jacket and the hat.

11:39.562 --> 11:41.230
This guy exits the newsroom at 8:42 a.m.

11:41.264 --> 11:43.966
Half hour later a pod
picks him up across the street.

11:43.999 --> 11:46.110
It's eight minutes after the
bombing and he's still there.

11:46.134 --> 11:47.269
Like, he stayed.

11:47.302 --> 11:48.971
He matches Sheri's description.

11:49.004 --> 11:50.581
Yeah, but it's not enough
for visual recognition.

11:50.605 --> 11:52.075
Okay, let's release it to the media.

11:52.108 --> 11:54.244
It's a person of interest.
Set up a tip line.

11:54.277 --> 11:56.546
Are we sure that's the plan?

11:56.579 --> 11:58.548
We got two pictures
of a guy in the vicinity.

11:58.581 --> 11:59.883
That's it.

12:00.983 --> 12:02.159
That can go wrong a thousand ways

12:02.183 --> 12:03.819
if the public has it.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.056
I still have Sheri's blood on me.

12:08.590 --> 12:09.768
You asking me, it's worth the risk.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.860
Someone's gonna know who this guy is.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.736
I'll get on the packs with news affairs.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.538
Have them release it.

12:23.773 --> 12:25.041
We got something.

12:25.073 --> 12:26.585
I interviewed the guard who was working

12:26.609 --> 12:27.977
the front desk at the news room.

12:28.009 --> 12:30.045
He says everyone has
to sign in to get inside.

12:30.079 --> 12:31.889
He only remembers one delivery
from this morning

12:31.913 --> 12:33.658
and he was on the phone
when the guy came in.

12:33.682 --> 12:35.652
But he swears he was white
and he had a beard.

12:35.685 --> 12:36.827
This guy's stopped by security

12:36.851 --> 12:38.254
before he delivered the bomb?

12:38.287 --> 12:40.023
This guy...

12:40.056 --> 12:41.824
signed his name in the inout book.

12:41.856 --> 12:44.059
Eric Mitchel, he's a journalist

12:44.092 --> 12:45.928
at a local entertainment magazine.

12:45.961 --> 12:49.032
35, white, beard.

12:49.065 --> 12:50.901
Bring him in.

12:52.802 --> 12:54.970
- Nice house for a journalist.
- Yeah.

12:55.004 --> 12:57.005
I thought journalism was
supposed to be extinct.

12:57.038 --> 12:58.073
Depends what kind.

12:58.106 --> 12:59.308
Still have a lot of money

12:59.341 --> 13:01.043
if you make the news entertainment.

13:02.611 --> 13:04.046
Hey, is that Mitchel?

13:06.948 --> 13:08.617
Yeah, those are his plates.

13:08.650 --> 13:10.085
SUV is Mitchel.

13:10.119 --> 13:11.921
So we're gonna approach
on foot, distract him.

13:11.954 --> 13:13.723
You guys come up behind him.

13:13.755 --> 13:15.759
Copy. We're moving in now.

13:23.331 --> 13:25.802
Looks like he shaved his beard.

13:27.003 --> 13:29.605
- Eric Mitchel.
- Yeah?

13:33.709 --> 13:34.753
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

13:34.777 --> 13:35.845
All right, call it in.

13:35.878 --> 13:37.946
5021 Henry. Emergency.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.882
- We have an explosion at...
- You guys good?

13:39.914 --> 13:41.817
- Yeah, you?
- We got to get him covered up.

13:41.850 --> 13:43.285
Ambulance, CFD, Bomb and Arson.

13:43.318 --> 13:44.820
Could be multiple devices.

13:44.854 --> 13:46.230
Make sure they block off
a twoblock radius.

13:46.254 --> 13:48.306
The entire blast hit him
head on. He's gone.

13:48.331 --> 13:50.059
Hey. I saw it happen.

13:50.091 --> 13:51.827
- I was right over there.
- Sir, I need you to step back.

13:51.851 --> 13:53.171
- Can I help?
- Yeah, I know you want to help

13:53.195 --> 13:54.639
- but I need you to stand back.
- What can I do?

13:54.663 --> 13:56.699
Thank you.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.429
Okay, Bomb and Arson confirmed

14:08.454 --> 14:10.257
the bomb was wired to the mailbox door.

14:10.453 --> 14:12.457
It's possible someone saw
the bomb being planted.

14:12.491 --> 14:14.434
Area Central and Patrol are
canvassing the neighborhood.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.057
We're running pods against surveillance

14:16.082 --> 14:17.237
but so far we've got nothing.

14:17.261 --> 14:18.835
We know Eric Mitchel's not our bomber

14:18.860 --> 14:20.777
being we just watched him get blown up.

14:20.832 --> 14:22.567
What the hell are we looking at?

14:22.599 --> 14:24.284
This son of a bitch led us there.

14:24.309 --> 14:25.377
He's screwing with us.

14:25.402 --> 14:26.479
He signed in using the name of

14:26.503 --> 14:27.938
his next target so we'd follow.

14:27.972 --> 14:31.410
That's right. This is not
an isolated incident.

14:31.443 --> 14:34.680
Okay? This could be the start
of a bombing campaign.

14:34.713 --> 14:36.982
This guy's got an agenda.

14:37.015 --> 14:39.050
All right, what do we know
about Eric Mitchel.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.819
Well, he worked in media 15 years.

14:40.852 --> 14:42.554
Journalist at an entertainment magazine.

14:42.587 --> 14:44.689
There's no evidence
of death threats against him,

14:44.723 --> 14:46.000
but that doesn't mean
that it didn't happen

14:46.024 --> 14:47.426
over the phone or facetoface.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.694
Bomb and Arson and Homicide

14:48.727 --> 14:50.761
are digging up more as we speak.

14:50.795 --> 14:54.466
Seriously, if one more person
asks me if I'm okay

14:54.498 --> 14:55.833
they are not gonna be okay.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.569
I just want to help.

14:57.602 --> 14:58.970
And we'll take it.

14:59.002 --> 15:01.573
Bomb and Arson's got an update.

15:01.606 --> 15:02.874
I'll come with.

15:02.906 --> 15:04.343
Okay, so we're gonna go

15:04.376 --> 15:06.011
- with what we got, okay?
- I'm okay.

15:06.044 --> 15:07.679
- Okay.
- The bombs themselves,

15:07.712 --> 15:09.848
the IDs of these two victims.

15:09.881 --> 15:11.449
We know they're both in the media.

15:11.482 --> 15:13.551
There's some connection
between these two.

15:13.584 --> 15:15.554
There's a reason they were targeted.

15:15.587 --> 15:18.790
So let's find the damn nexus
before another bomb goes off.

15:18.823 --> 15:20.759
Come on, Trudy. I'll give you an update.

15:20.791 --> 15:22.860
I'm talking clean.

15:22.894 --> 15:24.863
This isn't some teenage wank
screwing around

15:24.896 --> 15:26.798
with his dad's Home Depot account.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.567
The wires, the initiators,
the circuit board,

15:29.601 --> 15:31.937
the soldering alone on these things.

15:31.969 --> 15:33.771
It's by someone who knew
what they were doing.

15:33.805 --> 15:35.373
Took their time to do it.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.675
Devices were personalized

15:36.708 --> 15:38.443
based on the location he was hitting.

15:38.476 --> 15:41.146
The first device was an IED
relying on a time switch.

15:41.179 --> 15:43.615
It was created to invoke
as much damage as possible

15:43.647 --> 15:44.982
within an enclosed space.

15:45.016 --> 15:47.151
The ball bearings, the nails, the bolts.

15:47.184 --> 15:49.487
Plus enough gasoline
to spread hefty fire.

15:49.521 --> 15:51.857
All right, so that's
different from our second?

15:51.890 --> 15:54.159
The second is a victimactivated IED.

15:54.191 --> 15:56.394
It was triggered when Mitchel
opened up his mailbox.

15:56.428 --> 15:58.830
So two different models but
you're saying this is one guy?

15:58.862 --> 16:00.898
Yeah, it's the exact same materials,

16:00.931 --> 16:02.633
same signature. It's like handwriting.

16:02.666 --> 16:04.044
Same brain built both of these things.

16:04.068 --> 16:06.103
Okay, so these bolts,
the nails, the wires

16:06.136 --> 16:07.772
the gasoline even, I can purchase

16:07.805 --> 16:09.083
that stuff at a hardware store, right?

16:09.107 --> 16:11.776
You could but you couldn't buy the C4.

16:13.077 --> 16:16.381
Both bombs used militarygrade C4.

16:17.449 --> 16:19.050
All right, you can't buy
that kind of C4

16:19.083 --> 16:21.161
over the counter, and the
military keeps strict records

16:21.185 --> 16:23.030
- on theft and storage.
- It had to be either stolen

16:23.054 --> 16:24.656
or bought on the black market.

16:24.689 --> 16:25.900
I'm digging at an angle with ATF.

16:25.924 --> 16:27.200
Yeah, rest of the bomb components

16:27.224 --> 16:28.902
are gonna be hard to track.
They're generic.

16:28.926 --> 16:30.170
- Sold in hundreds of stores.
- All right.

16:30.194 --> 16:31.963
Where are we at with the connection?

16:31.996 --> 16:34.665
Nowhere. Eric and Sheri
never worked together.

16:34.699 --> 16:36.209
They never reported on the same story.

16:36.233 --> 16:37.911
There's no evidence they really
even knew each other.

16:37.935 --> 16:39.805
Antonio, your tip line
sparked something,

16:39.838 --> 16:41.206
but we got to move fast.

16:41.238 --> 16:43.774
Somebody called in,
identified the pod photos.

16:43.808 --> 16:45.843
Mark Tremon. Height, weight.

16:45.877 --> 16:48.045
Match everything the tech lab
already told us about.

16:48.079 --> 16:50.614
He worked security at
the news station for two years

16:50.647 --> 16:51.816
and he went to Illinois State

16:51.849 --> 16:53.551
the same time Eric Mitchel did.

16:53.584 --> 16:55.061
That's the nexus between our victims,

16:55.085 --> 16:57.621
but that's not even the crazy part.

16:57.655 --> 16:58.990
He's army, Sarge.

16:59.022 --> 17:01.726
Did a tour in Iraq. EOD.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.095
Explosive Ordinance Disposal.

17:05.864 --> 17:07.499
All right, you two round robin?

17:07.531 --> 17:08.942
Burgess and Ruzek are already
headed to his house,

17:08.965 --> 17:10.468
but we need to move

17:10.502 --> 17:11.978
because the Internet is blowing him up.

17:12.002 --> 17:13.046
They already ID'd the photos.

17:13.069 --> 17:14.238
He gonna see us coming.

17:14.271 --> 17:15.506
I'll meet them there.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.474
- Nice work.
- Yeah.

17:17.876 --> 17:19.118
Our phone's been ringing off the hook.

17:19.143 --> 17:20.846
We just need to bring your husband in

17:20.877 --> 17:22.222
- to ask a few questions.
- What is all that?

17:22.246 --> 17:23.990
Ma'am, your husband.
Do you know where he is?

17:24.013 --> 17:25.258
We're not giving you consent
to enter our home.

17:25.281 --> 17:26.717
Sir, can you step outside, please?

17:26.751 --> 17:27.953
No, I'm not stepping anywhere.

17:27.984 --> 17:29.186
What the hell is going on?

17:29.220 --> 17:30.889
I want to see both of your hands!

17:30.922 --> 17:32.089
You got to be kidding me.

17:32.123 --> 17:33.592
Get away from my daughter!

17:33.625 --> 17:34.693
Just come through, baby.

17:34.725 --> 17:35.993
She can come through.

17:36.027 --> 17:37.662
Don't put your hands on my daughter.

17:37.694 --> 17:39.105
- Sir, can you...
- Let her... Hey, man!

17:39.129 --> 17:41.232
Hey! Hey! Don't touch my daughter!

17:41.265 --> 17:43.601
- Dad, dad!
- Hey, don't touch my daughter.

17:43.635 --> 17:45.036
Don't touch my daughter!

17:45.069 --> 17:46.204
- No!
- Get off of me!

17:46.236 --> 17:47.671
- Calm down!
- Get off me!

17:49.007 --> 17:50.775
- It's all right, baby.
- You're fine.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.010
It's all right, baby.

17:52.042 --> 17:53.544
- You got his hands?
- Get off me.

17:55.713 --> 17:57.549
I don't want him here.

17:57.581 --> 17:59.283
Okay.

17:59.317 --> 18:03.521
I got to tell you though,
this room you're in?

18:03.554 --> 18:06.991
It's not a place you get a lot
of things you want.

18:07.024 --> 18:08.302
I mean, you know why you're here, right?

18:08.326 --> 18:09.895
I've already been interviewed twice.

18:09.927 --> 18:11.530
Two of your detectives.

18:11.562 --> 18:13.264
Well you're gonna talk to me now.

18:13.298 --> 18:14.799
I'm here because of you.

18:14.831 --> 18:16.166
Police tweet out a picture of me.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.911
Push me to the ground,
put me in this chair...

18:17.935 --> 18:21.071
You're here 'cause of them.

18:21.105 --> 18:24.276
Three bombing victims, one day.

18:26.344 --> 18:28.880
I told your officers,
I was at that news station

18:28.913 --> 18:30.815
to get someone to fill out
a form of reference.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.082
Yeah, well the problem is

18:32.116 --> 18:34.152
we can't find any evidence of that.

18:34.184 --> 18:37.289
You don't have the form,
and no one remembers.

18:37.321 --> 18:39.089
I threw it out!

18:39.123 --> 18:40.859
I walked in there.
Old boss wasn't there.

18:40.892 --> 18:43.194
So I walked out.

18:43.226 --> 18:44.772
The Internet tells you I'm some villain

18:44.796 --> 18:46.197
and you believe it?

18:46.230 --> 18:47.966
I'm a regular guy.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.035
You're not a regular guy.

18:50.068 --> 18:51.636
You're a guy who was at the scene

18:51.668 --> 18:54.071
of an explosion that was cordoned off.

18:54.105 --> 18:56.575
Do you know what a police cordon is?

18:56.607 --> 18:59.010
All witnesses and civilians
go into holding,

18:59.042 --> 19:01.178
and you weren't in holding,
which means you bypassed

19:01.212 --> 19:02.781
the police department cordon.

19:02.813 --> 19:04.091
I had to get back home to my kid.

19:04.115 --> 19:06.952
You're a guy who knew Sheri,

19:06.984 --> 19:08.587
knew Eric.

19:08.619 --> 19:11.055
- Who the hell is Eric?
- He went to ISU with you.

19:11.088 --> 19:12.857
What? I went to school for like a month.

19:12.889 --> 19:14.358
That's access to both our victims.

19:14.392 --> 19:17.662
- This is bull...
- And you were EOD.

19:17.694 --> 19:18.963
Excuse me?

19:18.996 --> 19:21.231
You know IEDs!

19:21.264 --> 19:23.532
Right?

19:23.557 --> 19:25.593
You defused them.

19:25.770 --> 19:27.838
I'll bet you can make them.

19:30.273 --> 19:32.643
- Give me a lawyer.
- The more you talk to us

19:32.676 --> 19:34.798
- the easier it is...
- Get me a damn lawyer.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.415
All right, tell me we got something

19:42.447 --> 19:43.849
'cause Mark ain't talking

19:43.881 --> 19:45.349
and we don't have enough to charge.

19:45.374 --> 19:46.452
Well, the nexus between Mark

19:46.476 --> 19:47.772
and the victims is real,

19:47.797 --> 19:50.001
but it's just not tight enough
to connect him to Eric.

19:50.034 --> 19:51.401
Outside of ISU,

19:51.435 --> 19:52.737
there's no real link.

19:52.769 --> 19:54.304
All right, what about the C4?

19:54.337 --> 19:56.506
ATF's report says this
particular batch of C4

19:56.539 --> 19:57.774
was made six years ago.

19:57.899 --> 19:59.668
Multiple blocks were reported stolen

19:59.702 --> 20:01.738
from the manufacturer in 2012.

20:01.771 --> 20:03.705
2012?

20:03.739 --> 20:05.708
So we're six years behind the lead.

20:05.741 --> 20:07.944
No, I got a guy in ATF.
I'll catch us up.

20:07.976 --> 20:10.612
Do we have anything I can use
as leverage on this guy?

20:10.646 --> 20:12.382
Mark's got a DUI from last year.

20:12.415 --> 20:14.450
He chewed out the arresting officer.

20:14.483 --> 20:15.717
He's an angry guy.

20:15.751 --> 20:16.953
But a lot of people are angry,

20:16.985 --> 20:18.288
especially after a few beers.

20:18.313 --> 20:19.748
Doesn't mean they build bombs.

20:19.773 --> 20:21.456
Look, if we're not finding anything

20:21.490 --> 20:23.168
then maybe we're looking
in the wrong place.

20:23.192 --> 20:25.828
This guy's house was cleared
of any bombmaking materials.

20:25.860 --> 20:27.405
And the security guard
at the news station

20:27.429 --> 20:28.873
said he couldn't pick
him out of a line up.

20:28.897 --> 20:30.174
To be fair, the guard at the station

20:30.198 --> 20:31.833
doubted he could ID the guy at all.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.010
He said he didn't get a good look.

20:33.034 --> 20:34.803
And Mark has no explanation

20:34.837 --> 20:36.628
why he stood outside
the bombing for eight minutes.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.354
Mark's got
a distinguished service cross.

20:38.379 --> 20:39.450
You know that doesn't mean anything.

20:39.474 --> 20:40.978
It means he fought
for the country and it means

20:41.002 --> 20:42.444
I give him the benefit
of the doubt, all right?

20:42.468 --> 20:44.079
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.

20:44.113 --> 20:45.891
I think these connections
seem pretty strained.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.884
- Jay, look...
- All right.

20:47.916 --> 20:50.986
Then cement or clear them.

20:52.954 --> 20:55.124
Do a psychological autopsy on Mark.

20:55.156 --> 20:56.893
Anyone he's talked to in the last week.

20:56.925 --> 20:59.529
Anyone who can speak to his behavior.

20:59.561 --> 21:00.896
Copy that.

21:00.929 --> 21:03.699
If Mark is our man,
someone's gonna know it.

21:07.168 --> 21:08.670
What's all that?

21:08.704 --> 21:10.071
Tracking Mark on social media.

21:10.105 --> 21:11.783
A lot of people coming
out the woodwork saying

21:11.807 --> 21:13.017
they saw it coming, and so I'm trying

21:13.041 --> 21:14.743
to verify if any of it's true.

21:14.777 --> 21:17.013
- And?
- So far, nothing.

21:17.046 --> 21:19.782
Trolls jumping on the bandwagon.

21:19.815 --> 21:21.717
People love to watch things burn.

21:28.223 --> 21:31.092
Yeah, Mark's phone records
indicate that we're friends

21:31.126 --> 21:32.194
'cause we are.

21:32.227 --> 21:34.196
You worked at WNMZ together, yeah?

21:34.230 --> 21:36.999
I was there for a month.
Didn't work out.

21:37.031 --> 21:38.800
Look, guys, I can't do
anything to help you.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.168
And I'm at my job.

21:40.202 --> 21:41.947
We're an hour late getting
this shipment out.

21:41.971 --> 21:43.806
Okay, well, we just
got a few quick questions

21:43.838 --> 21:45.049
and then you can do your thing, dawg.

21:45.073 --> 21:46.485
Did you talk to Mark at all this week?

21:46.509 --> 21:48.176
About his bike.

21:48.210 --> 21:49.812
And his kid.

21:49.845 --> 21:51.981
Okay, did he seem off to you at all?

21:52.013 --> 21:54.550
Was his behavior different in any way?

21:54.582 --> 21:56.862
Did he seem like he was gonna
blow up a couple of buildings?

21:56.886 --> 21:58.820
No, he didn't.

21:58.854 --> 22:01.090
Mark gets hot, but he's not hard.

22:01.123 --> 22:02.959
He never even talked to that news lady.

22:02.992 --> 22:04.694
If anything, he protected her.

22:04.726 --> 22:06.528
He tried to protect Sheri, you saw this?

22:06.561 --> 22:08.563
Look, some guy came in
to talked to Sheri.

22:08.597 --> 22:10.966
He was all jacked up
and screaming about something

22:11.000 --> 22:14.103
she wrote or some news blog
or gossip blog or something,

22:14.136 --> 22:16.939
and Mark forced him from the building.

22:16.972 --> 22:19.775
Okay, when was this
and what did he look like?

22:19.808 --> 22:21.577
It was a white guy, about my age.

22:21.609 --> 22:23.146
I think he had a beard.

22:24.946 --> 22:27.483
- Okay.
- Thank you.

22:28.884 --> 22:30.720
What are you doing?

22:30.752 --> 22:32.821
Giving Shuman a bathroom break?

22:32.855 --> 22:34.766
How is it every time I give
Shuman desk assignment

22:34.790 --> 22:36.626
his bladder fails him? Hey, Wallace.

22:36.658 --> 22:39.127
You know, if there was ever
a day to take off

22:39.160 --> 22:42.564
it would be the day after
someone tried to blow you up.

22:42.598 --> 22:44.834
You could take a day, you know.
Get your hair done.

22:44.867 --> 22:47.069
- What's wrong with my hair?
- Not a thing.

22:47.101 --> 22:50.005
Not a thing. Just something people do.

22:50.039 --> 22:52.016
Like my grandmother, she takes
a day and get her hair done.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.208
Not that I am in anyway...

22:53.242 --> 22:54.549
- Referring to you as my grand...
- Burgess, Burgess.

22:54.573 --> 22:56.609
Burgess!

22:56.779 --> 22:59.115
Everyone!

22:59.147 --> 23:01.283
Don't key your radios.
Don't touch your phones.

23:01.317 --> 23:03.019
Burgess, I want you to go downstairs

23:03.051 --> 23:05.655
shackle up the prisoners
and lead them outside.

23:05.687 --> 23:06.821
I'll evacuate upstairs.

23:06.855 --> 23:09.559
We need to clear the district now.

23:17.366 --> 23:19.068
Device has been defused.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.637
We're doing a sweep
for any secondary devices.

23:21.669 --> 23:22.948
We'll get you in as soon as we can.

23:22.972 --> 23:24.574
Do we know what it was?

23:24.607 --> 23:26.175
Some cheap, crude IED.

23:26.207 --> 23:28.076
I don't think the thing
would have gone off.

23:28.109 --> 23:30.012
That doesn't fit with our offender.

23:30.044 --> 23:31.680
It does and it doesn't.

23:31.713 --> 23:33.182
Same material. Same signature.

23:33.214 --> 23:34.817
We'll investigate the components,

23:34.849 --> 23:36.651
but this is him.

23:36.685 --> 23:38.588
Just built this one fast.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.556
Get you in as soon as we can.

23:41.823 --> 23:43.625
Built it fast.

23:43.658 --> 23:45.227
We pissed him off.

23:49.008 --> 23:51.294
He gave us a lead. Let's not waste it.

23:51.319 --> 23:53.413
- That device came from somewhere.
- Just give me a second.

23:53.437 --> 23:55.458
All right, we're at a zero
with delivery.

23:55.483 --> 23:57.138
The device was delivered and mailed

23:57.163 --> 23:59.413
from a UPS store by a private shipper.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.849
The order for pickup was made online

24:00.873 --> 24:02.675
with a prepaid money card.
Yeah, I'm back.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.344
Customer requested the box be picked up

24:04.369 --> 24:06.045
at a residential address on Sheirdan.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.913
- House is vacant.
- Check the deeds.

24:07.938 --> 24:10.553
Run every single property owner
in the past two decades.

24:10.578 --> 24:12.244
- Yeah.
- Box and device are being

24:12.285 --> 24:14.364
rushed through for DNA,
but it was wiped with bleach.

24:14.388 --> 24:15.755
Bomb squad said same materials

24:15.789 --> 24:17.191
as our other two devices.

24:17.224 --> 24:18.325
It's generic, store bought.

24:18.358 --> 24:19.560
We'd be running down deadends.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.694
Well, run them anyway.

24:20.726 --> 24:21.871
We don't assume anything is dead

24:21.895 --> 24:23.531
- until we pronounce it.
- Hey.

24:23.563 --> 24:27.433
I got copies of the note
that was on the packing slip.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.570
"Once again an innocent man blown up

24:29.602 --> 24:30.837
"by the engine of fake news.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.339
"The CPD, further perpetrators

24:32.371 --> 24:34.908
of the fake news engine will burn."

24:34.941 --> 24:36.676
He's talking about Mark.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.312
The security guard?

24:38.344 --> 24:39.846
Mark's got to be the innocent man.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.849
"Once again." "Once again." I mean...

24:41.881 --> 24:43.358
He's referring to fake news as if it's

24:43.382 --> 24:45.186
blown up someone close to him before.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.321
- It's personal.
- Found it.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.756
The gossip blog Mark's friend mentioned.

24:49.790 --> 24:51.859
Sheri never officially worked for one.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.726
But there was a blog.
"The Chicago Scoop."

24:53.760 --> 24:56.530
It was active Sheri's last
two years a Northwestern.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.765
The site reported on gossip, scandal,

24:58.799 --> 25:00.367
anything that was pulltherug worthy.

25:00.399 --> 25:02.937
Whole thing was anonymous,
but the historical data,

25:02.969 --> 25:06.273
IPs, it was Sheri. She ran it.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.975
Sheri wrote a story there

25:08.007 --> 25:10.210
that tore someone's life apart.

25:10.244 --> 25:12.679
And Eric reported on that same story.

25:12.713 --> 25:14.815
I mean, that would fit.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.884
All right, let's run with it.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.221
So we're not gonna hold Mark
on the whole 48, right?

25:21.254 --> 25:22.922
He was in custody
when the bomb was sent.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.491
Doesn't fit the profile,

25:24.523 --> 25:26.493
and he's got a wife
and a daughter at home.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.728
Yeah, I know, but new profile or not

25:28.762 --> 25:31.331
we haven't cleared him fully yet, so...

25:31.364 --> 25:32.398
What?

25:32.431 --> 25:34.367
His life's getting destroyed online.

25:34.400 --> 25:35.302
Yeah.

25:35.335 --> 25:38.572
I mean, one more day won't
change that, so.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.949
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.820
- You look good.
- No, I don't.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.554
Rebecca left me.

25:54.588 --> 25:55.923
Now all I do is eat Pizza Hut

25:55.956 --> 25:58.859
and watch reruns of "M.A.S.H."

25:58.891 --> 26:00.460
This didn't come from me.

26:00.494 --> 26:03.397
Guys in my unit are running
a case on this dealer,

26:03.429 --> 26:06.266
so I wanna play it close to the vest.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.701
Ali Beron. He big time?

26:08.702 --> 26:10.671
Decent.

26:10.704 --> 26:11.972
Mostly deals in artillery,

26:12.004 --> 26:13.974
but he was selling C4 a year ago.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.509
It was your stuff.

26:16.543 --> 26:18.911
Now, we were gonna make him,
but he got tipped.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.455
By the time we got to his Midwest hub,

26:20.479 --> 26:21.581
place was empty.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.549
We know where the C4's at?

26:25.017 --> 26:27.287
If we had a tip, we would
have given it to you.

26:27.321 --> 26:29.657
But we're getting close
to the nailing Ali

26:29.689 --> 26:32.392
because this small time fence
in Indianapolis

26:32.426 --> 26:36.030
says he bought three RPGs
from him a year ago, cheap.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.874
Said there's more to buy,
but he was only interested

26:37.898 --> 26:39.332
in the heavy stuff.

26:39.366 --> 26:41.502
So I'm looking for a smalltime fence.

26:41.534 --> 26:43.437
Honestly, the guy selling the C4s

26:43.469 --> 26:45.405
probably some dude
hocking it from his garage.

26:45.438 --> 26:48.508
Ali just wanted to dump his product.

26:48.542 --> 26:51.512
Gonna be a needle
in a lot of lowlife hay.

26:51.544 --> 26:54.481
Well, lowlife hay's where I live.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.518
So we think that Eric
and Sheri were targeted

26:58.552 --> 27:00.754
for a story that they both reported on

27:00.786 --> 27:02.989
something inflammatory.

27:03.023 --> 27:05.626
Being as Sheri wrote over 300 articles

27:05.658 --> 27:08.762
for her blog while Eric worked
here at the Telegraph, so...

27:08.794 --> 27:10.772
We were hoping that one of
these would jump out at you

27:10.796 --> 27:12.999
as a story that Eric would
have worked on too.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.901
I'm sorry, most of Sheri's articles

27:14.935 --> 27:16.736
are pop culture and gossip.

27:16.770 --> 27:18.571
When Eric worked here he was a stringer.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.640
- He chased crime stories?
- Homicides.

27:20.674 --> 27:23.477
Englewood, Garfield Park,
daily blood and bullets.

27:23.510 --> 27:25.020
It would have to be something
with enough weight

27:25.044 --> 27:26.479
to disrupt someone's life.

27:26.513 --> 27:29.082
Didn't Eric run the Larry Shepard story?

27:29.116 --> 27:31.352
- What story was that?
- Shepard.

27:31.385 --> 27:33.420
He was a reporter here,
investigative journalist.

27:33.453 --> 27:35.589
Was a good guy,
fired about two years ago.

27:35.621 --> 27:37.457
Why was he fired?

27:38.524 --> 27:40.660
Shepard had been reporting on a murder

27:40.694 --> 27:43.997
and then rumors started
circulating at other outlets

27:44.030 --> 27:45.966
that he was in some way...

27:45.998 --> 27:48.368
that he had murdered the woman.

27:48.401 --> 27:49.635
A journalist being accused

27:49.660 --> 27:51.209
of the very crime he was reporting?

27:51.234 --> 27:53.506
- You can imagine.
- That got press time?

27:53.540 --> 27:54.608
Lots of it.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.377
Look, our paper did the right thing.

27:56.409 --> 27:59.379
It was a PR nightmare.
They had to fire Shepard.

27:59.412 --> 28:01.914
Okay, so Shepard got
arrested for the murder?

28:01.947 --> 28:03.484
No. God, no.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.951
It was nonsense.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.989
So you guys blew up
your reporter's career

28:09.022 --> 28:10.890
based on fake news.

28:10.924 --> 28:13.060
Yeah, he never forgave us for that.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.695
His own paper, his own column.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.863
I saw him a couple
of weeks ago on the L.

28:16.897 --> 28:18.564
Started yelling when he saw me.

28:18.598 --> 28:21.869
Larry Shepard. White male, 40s, beard.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.770
It matches.

28:29.642 --> 28:30.843
Go dark.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.152
Hold.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.623
Go.

30:58.992 --> 31:02.796
Hey, Sarge, put a BOLO out on
every car Shepard's ever owned.

31:02.829 --> 31:04.673
Canvassing every neighborhood
he's ever lived in.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.275
Area Central's talking
to friends and family,

31:06.299 --> 31:07.710
but, boss, I got to tell you this guy,

31:07.734 --> 31:09.202
he was prepared for this.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.338
He hasn't used his cell phone
in over three months.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.806
Not a single credit card.
CTA hit nothing.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.043
He wiped his social media,
bank accounts, email.

31:17.077 --> 31:18.393
This guy's living in the dark.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.246
I don't know how we're gonna find him.

31:20.685 --> 31:21.801
- Sergeant.
- Yeah.

31:21.826 --> 31:22.841
Dawson and Upton are sitting

31:22.865 --> 31:24.059
on Shepard's house, no movement.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.320
Yeah, I doubt there will be. All right.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.254
Just walk me through what we know.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.355
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.724
Two years ago Shepard

31:30.756 --> 31:32.034
was investigating the brutal murder

31:32.058 --> 31:34.027
of this young woman in Ravenswood.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.426
- Okay.
- Sheri,

31:35.451 --> 31:37.153
while working her blog, noticed,

31:37.187 --> 31:39.365
I guess you would call it,
an obsessive bent to his story

31:39.389 --> 31:42.459
because in multiple articles
Shepard refers to her beauty,

31:42.491 --> 31:44.360
radiance. Sheri thought it was off.

31:44.393 --> 31:45.796
So she dug into it.

31:45.828 --> 31:46.996
She found out Shepard

31:47.029 --> 31:48.431
knew the woman who was murdered.

31:48.465 --> 31:50.801
She wrote a tweet in her blog.

31:50.834 --> 31:53.036
A joke accusing Shepard of the crime.

31:53.068 --> 31:55.104
"I went ahead and solved
the Ravenswood murder.

31:55.138 --> 31:58.008
Where was Shepard the night of?"

31:58.040 --> 32:00.710
So she was murdered
over this twosentence joke?

32:00.744 --> 32:02.120
Yeah, she never wrote
anything else on Shepard.

32:02.144 --> 32:03.446
Never even met him.

32:03.479 --> 32:05.716
She was killed
over those 140 characters.

32:05.748 --> 32:07.718
The tweet gets spread,
picked up, reported,

32:07.750 --> 32:09.185
and then Shepard, he gets fired.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.453
Our people investigated him.

32:10.487 --> 32:11.930
They found almost none of it was true.

32:11.954 --> 32:13.489
I read the homicide report.

32:13.523 --> 32:15.258
They basically cleared him
from the jump.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.359
They found the real killer
a couple months later.

32:17.392 --> 32:18.761
Yeah, didn't matter though.

32:18.795 --> 32:20.106
Shepard couldn't get another job.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.832
His wife left him, then three months ago

32:21.864 --> 32:24.166
she commits suicide.
I guess he just broke.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.268
He did try to erase
his digital footprint,

32:26.302 --> 32:28.205
but CPIK was able to pull this

32:28.238 --> 32:30.239
from a deleted account.

32:30.273 --> 32:32.509
There comes a time when people pay,

32:32.542 --> 32:34.144
when their actions matter,

32:34.177 --> 32:36.012
when the libel they spit into the ether

32:36.045 --> 32:39.149
of a virtual landscape has a reckoning.

32:39.181 --> 32:42.318
Journalism needs to be accountable.

32:42.352 --> 32:44.454
People need to be responsible.

32:44.487 --> 32:48.225
All right, so he goes on
like that for quite a while.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.459
Do we know where he's
gonna be hitting next?

32:50.492 --> 32:52.128
If we assume that he's gonna target

32:52.161 --> 32:53.896
a journalist that reported on him,

32:53.930 --> 32:55.307
then we got these
half a dozen possibilities.

32:55.331 --> 32:57.767
Now, we're trying to round
these people up, but...

32:57.800 --> 32:59.769
Shepard could have bombs
planted already.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.371
- Right.
- So we're like seven steps

33:01.403 --> 33:03.405
behind this guy.

33:03.439 --> 33:04.908
All right, let's make it a priority.

33:04.940 --> 33:06.777
Bring in anyone who might be a target.

33:06.809 --> 33:08.486
All right, I got a guy
who might know where Shepard

33:08.510 --> 33:10.980
bought his C4. I had Tact bring him in.

33:11.014 --> 33:12.750
- Could use a second.
- Yeah.

33:14.116 --> 33:15.417
Put the rest of that thing on.

33:15.450 --> 33:16.419
You got it.

33:16.451 --> 33:17.887
No, no, no, no, no.

33:17.921 --> 33:18.997
I don't have to talk to you anymore.

33:19.021 --> 33:20.256
I worked that case off.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.500
I just got a couple of questions...

33:21.524 --> 33:23.026
No, no! I'm better now.

33:23.058 --> 33:26.095
Listen, the thing is, all my Cis,

33:26.129 --> 33:28.131
they pointed me to you, Malcolm.

33:28.163 --> 33:29.441
They say that you're still busy.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.168
No, I ain't. I'm better.

33:31.200 --> 33:34.336
No, they say you're still
making your little gadgets.

33:35.438 --> 33:36.873
So now all I need is the name

33:36.905 --> 33:38.841
of a small time fence dealing C4.

33:38.874 --> 33:40.485
No, I don't make weapons
no more. I'm better.

33:40.509 --> 33:42.244
Is that a cell phone?

33:42.277 --> 33:44.247
You can't bring that near me,
okay? You can't.

33:44.279 --> 33:46.425
I can't be around those things.
This is how it's gonna end.

33:46.449 --> 33:49.318
- This is how it's all gonna end.
- Okay, okay, hey, hey.

33:49.352 --> 33:50.921
I'll put it away.

33:50.953 --> 33:53.088
- He give you anything?
- No.

33:53.122 --> 33:55.491
Come on. All we need is a name, Malcolm.

33:55.525 --> 33:57.960
No, I told you. I'm better now.

33:59.062 --> 34:01.064
You don't have a choice I guess.

34:01.096 --> 34:04.367
He's gonna... he's gonna search
your place, Malcolm.

34:05.267 --> 34:07.870
Now, if he finds anything
that violates your parole,

34:07.904 --> 34:10.407
chemicals, weapons, whatever,

34:10.438 --> 34:12.809
he's gonna take it.

34:13.542 --> 34:15.110
Or you can just give us a name

34:15.143 --> 34:17.246
and you get to go home
like you never saw us.

34:22.918 --> 34:25.087
- All right.
- What kind?

34:26.355 --> 34:29.458
Military grade in bricks.

34:29.491 --> 34:32.027
Manufactured in 2012.

34:32.060 --> 34:33.438
Small time fence would have probably

34:33.462 --> 34:35.931
just started selling it this year.

34:38.234 --> 34:40.871
George Lehr.

34:40.904 --> 34:43.139
George Lehr. We met this prick.

34:43.172 --> 34:45.242
He was a witness
at Eric Mitchel's explosion.

34:45.274 --> 34:46.426
He offered to help us.

34:46.451 --> 34:48.011
We had him fill out a witness report

34:48.043 --> 34:49.980
on the scene, made him
give a driver's license.

34:50.013 --> 34:51.871
Adam and I checked out
his ID by the way.

34:51.896 --> 34:53.014
- It's legit.
- But he's our fence.

34:53.038 --> 34:54.806
Sold the C4 Shepard's using.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.386
Which means they were in contact.

34:56.418 --> 34:57.953
Okay, we know this how?

34:57.986 --> 35:00.189
Messages on Lehr's Facebook timeline.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.158
Five in two months, each one posted

35:02.190 --> 35:03.660
from a different dummy profile.

35:03.692 --> 35:05.895
Then three days ago
another dummy profile

35:05.928 --> 35:07.596
posted nothing but an email address.

35:07.629 --> 35:09.498
The email address has since
been shut down,

35:09.531 --> 35:10.966
but I think it was Shepard.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.335
All right. So you want to take him?

35:13.368 --> 35:14.904
No.

35:14.937 --> 35:17.039
I mean, we finally
got a lead to Shepard.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.575
I don't want to blow it.

35:18.607 --> 35:20.609
Look, get coverts on Lehr's house.

35:20.643 --> 35:23.013
Find out everything about this guy.

35:23.046 --> 35:24.924
If these two are on contact,
we got to figure out

35:24.948 --> 35:28.218
a way to get ahead of it
without Lehr knowing.

35:30.386 --> 35:32.922
Hey, you should probably
go ahead and release Mark.

35:45.100 --> 35:47.002
I made myself real damn clear

35:47.035 --> 35:48.614
I'm not talking to anyone
without my lawyer

35:48.638 --> 35:50.073
sitting next to me.

35:50.105 --> 35:51.941
Not here to interrogate you.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.643
You're free to go.

35:56.511 --> 35:58.515
So no charge?

35:58.547 --> 36:00.250
No, sir.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.263
You don't even have
the stomach to apologize.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.369
You're free to go.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.687
Yeah, what's up?

36:37.620 --> 36:39.189
What?

36:39.221 --> 36:41.557
What do you mean she's packing?
I'm on my way.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.532
All right, so what's the plan then?

36:49.564 --> 36:52.301
Well, I don't really want
to spend the weekend alone

36:52.335 --> 36:54.137
on house arrest in your apartment.

36:54.169 --> 36:56.372
- Yeah.
- And I was gonna go to Mom's,

36:56.406 --> 36:58.475
but she's sleeping over
at a boyfriend's.

36:58.508 --> 37:01.611
So just hightail it out of here?

37:01.643 --> 37:03.714
I'm going to Aunt Mara's.

37:05.448 --> 37:07.017
Wait, wait.

37:07.049 --> 37:08.218
In Detroit?

37:08.250 --> 37:09.451
You're gonna take a bus alone

37:09.484 --> 37:11.286
- in the middle of the night?
- Yes.

37:11.319 --> 37:13.288
Yeah, Dad, I'm gonna somewhere

37:13.321 --> 37:16.258
where people can stand who I've become.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.261
Eva, you know I didn't mean...

37:18.294 --> 37:20.096
No, you know what hurts most?

37:20.129 --> 37:22.431
You didn't give me
a chance to explain, okay?

37:22.464 --> 37:24.767
I went to that party
to pick up my drunk friend.

37:24.801 --> 37:26.803
So she wouldn't drive.

37:26.835 --> 37:28.475
Then they all posted
these pictures online

37:28.504 --> 37:30.315
and suddenly it looks
like I was there partying.

37:30.339 --> 37:31.708
But I wasn't.

37:31.741 --> 37:35.045
You can't decide who I am
off of a picture.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.315
Or how people react to a picture.

37:43.819 --> 37:45.388
You're right.

37:47.156 --> 37:49.192
I should have let you explain.

37:50.692 --> 37:52.729
I got that wrong.

37:52.761 --> 37:54.530
I'm sorry.

38:04.674 --> 38:06.576
Thank you.

38:08.176 --> 38:10.747
I still deleted
your second account though.

38:10.779 --> 38:12.714
Because that stuff is dangerous, Eva.

38:12.747 --> 38:14.517
No, look, listen.

38:15.384 --> 38:19.355
You have to at least let me
try to protect you.

38:19.388 --> 38:21.458
That's what I want to do. That's it.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.612
I have another apology I have to make.

38:55.290 --> 38:57.227
Hey. Winslow, what happened?

38:57.259 --> 38:58.761
Couple of bricks through the window.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.395
Shattered glass at a 12yearold.

39:00.428 --> 39:02.206
She'll be fine. She's just
scared out of her mind.

39:02.230 --> 39:03.600
- Do you know who threw them?
- No.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.234
Family says they have no idea.

39:05.268 --> 39:07.737
It's linked to the bombings.

39:07.770 --> 39:09.706
It's the guy the internet ID'd.

39:09.739 --> 39:12.575
They've been getting a lot of
calls addressed to the house.

39:12.607 --> 39:14.576
Guy's one unlucky dude.

39:14.609 --> 39:17.180
Maybe you guys'll be around next time.

39:17.212 --> 39:18.556
Okay, thank you very much for your time.

39:18.580 --> 39:19.815
Nightly, you know.

39:19.848 --> 39:21.450
- Help me out.
- All right.

40:06.629 --> 40:08.297
- Sarge.
- Yeah.

40:08.330 --> 40:11.267
I think I have a way in with Lehr.

40:11.299 --> 40:13.335
It's a bit unorthodox,
but we would get his house,

40:13.368 --> 40:16.172
his emails. He wouldn't know a thing.

40:20.276 --> 40:21.978
Tell Antonio. I want him there with me.

40:22.011 --> 40:23.513
Okay.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.515
It's a potential of dozens of targets.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.226
I mean we're working
to get those mentioned

40:28.250 --> 40:29.785
prominently into protective custody,

40:29.819 --> 40:31.254
but it takes time.

40:31.286 --> 40:33.622
And we're making
predictions here, Chief.

40:33.656 --> 40:36.625
We can't be confident we know
where he's going next.

40:37.026 --> 40:39.328
All right.
We'll help you any way we can.

40:39.361 --> 40:41.363
- Thank you.
- Squad's off shift.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.565
Severide would be happy
to jump on transport.

40:43.598 --> 40:47.403
I appreciate that,
but it's not what we need.

40:50.939 --> 40:52.508
We need your paramedics.

40:52.540 --> 40:53.977
We strongly believe Shepard's

40:54.009 --> 40:56.245
in contact with a man, George Lehr.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.413
Now, Lehr's a fence.

40:57.446 --> 40:58.748
We believe the pair's actively

40:58.781 --> 41:00.650
- keeping in touch through email.
- Lehr?

41:00.683 --> 41:02.951
- Do I know that name?
- Yeah, you do.

41:02.984 --> 41:04.586
You and my sister responded to his house

41:04.620 --> 41:06.256
three times in the last six months.

41:06.288 --> 41:08.390
- He has a heart condition.
- No.

41:09.658 --> 41:12.694
Chief, look, we need realtime access

41:12.727 --> 41:15.998
to Lehr's emails, his laptop,
without him knowing.

41:16.031 --> 41:17.700
I said no.

41:17.732 --> 41:19.768
Chief, we can do this.

41:19.801 --> 41:21.004
Look.

41:22.071 --> 41:24.940
You will not endanger my paramedics.

41:27.576 --> 41:29.411
We need to get inside Lehr's house

41:29.444 --> 41:31.723
to clone his laptop.

41:31.913 --> 41:35.200
I need you to get us in the door.
