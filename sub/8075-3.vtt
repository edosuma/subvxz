00:03.271 --> 00:05.573
[theme music]

00:07.608 --> 00:09.477
Mrs. Conner, have
you seen this book?

00:09.510 --> 00:12.480
This is everything you need
to know about your baby.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.682
I don't need a book,
I watch Kathie Lee.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.852
All I want is a
book that'll teach

00:18.886 --> 00:20.721
my kid to kick her Cody's ass.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.293
Don't make fun of it,
there's a lot of really

00:25.326 --> 00:26.760
useful information in here.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.995
OK, yeah.
Here.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.897
Let me pick out a page,
I'll point to something,

00:29.930 --> 00:34.735
ask me a question, and see
if I don't already know it.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.703
Oh.

00:35.736 --> 00:36.604
What?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.606
Say it.

00:38.639 --> 00:39.740
Well.

00:39.773 --> 00:44.145
Um-- are you preparing
for lactation by-- by--

00:44.178 --> 00:44.978
toughening your nipples?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.217
Yes I am.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.884
I'm using them to grate cheese.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.489
Roseanne?

00:55.523 --> 00:58.259
There's something I need to
tell you, but before I do,

00:58.292 --> 01:02.796
I just want you to bear in mind
that calmer heads will prevail.

01:02.830 --> 01:03.697
What is it?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.833
The diner's going down.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.768
We are going out
of business, we're

01:07.801 --> 01:09.903
going to lose everything,
all of our money,

01:09.937 --> 01:11.705
our future, we're dead.
We are dead.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.773
We are dead!

01:16.277 --> 01:18.612
That restaurant across the
street is opening tomorrow,

01:18.646 --> 01:20.281
and I'm telling you, I
peeked in the window today,

01:20.314 --> 01:21.949
it is spectacular.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.452
The competition is
going to kill us.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.686
Oh, come on, Jackie.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.555
Every time somebody takes
over that restaurant,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.089
it's more pathetic.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.758
I remember when it
was French Ed's?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.696
Take a look at this ad.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.965
These people have money!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.800
Wow, a whole page?

01:39.833 --> 01:42.170
This looks like a
really nice place.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.738
Mrs. Conner, you should
put an ad in the paper.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.073
Save the advice,
David, and just

01:46.106 --> 01:48.509
keep sitting there and trying
to grow that Chia goatee.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.182
Roseanne, I am really worried!

01:54.215 --> 01:55.849
Don't worry about
the restaurant, Jackie,

01:55.883 --> 01:56.817
we're going to be fine.

01:56.850 --> 01:57.718
What if we're not?

01:57.751 --> 01:58.752
Then what are we going to do?

01:58.786 --> 02:00.053
Well, then,
we'll just dust off

02:00.087 --> 02:02.290
the old g-string and
tap dance our way

02:02.323 --> 02:05.826
back into America's heart.

02:05.859 --> 02:09.230
[theme music]

02:55.943 --> 02:58.679
Not that's a grand
opening, look at that crowd.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.813
I think you guys
are forgetting

02:59.847 --> 03:02.516
that our grand opening
was pretty cool, too.

03:02.550 --> 03:07.288
Guessing how many beans were
DJ's nose was only disgusting.

03:07.321 --> 03:11.158
Hey, people could not believe
that he could get 12 in there.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.128
That saved us a Chevy Cavalier.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.130
OK, now who's that over
there signing autographs?

03:17.164 --> 03:18.165
Is that some celebrity?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.634
Oh my god, oh my
god, oh my-- oh my--

03:20.668 --> 03:26.106
that's TV's Schneider,
from "One Day at a Time"!

03:26.139 --> 03:29.109
The jeans, the tool belt,
the rolled up sleeves,

03:29.142 --> 03:32.380
it all still works for him.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.847
I'm back from
across the street.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.848
Good, give us the report.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.950
OK, you're not going
to believe this.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.986
Did you know that Schneider
directed the series

03:39.019 --> 03:40.488
finale of "One Day at a Time"?

03:43.324 --> 03:45.058
Remember that scene
when Julie tells Barbara

03:45.092 --> 03:47.728
she'll always be there for her?

03:47.761 --> 03:50.230
I cried.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.232
Nancy, you were
sent over there

03:52.266 --> 03:56.470
to spy, and apparently your
cover as a moron was flawless.

03:56.504 --> 04:00.874
Anyway, the restaurant
is really nice.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.976
They stay open till
midnight, and they

04:03.010 --> 04:05.779
have a really great salad bar.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.485
A salad bar?

04:11.519 --> 04:14.522
Well, obviously they're
not from around here.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.224
This is a loose
meat kind of a town.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.093
We are not some
California tofu-eating,

04:20.127 --> 04:25.098
Nordictracking freaks
that want to live past 50.

04:25.132 --> 04:29.803
They also have a clean
kitchen, napkins on the table,

04:29.837 --> 04:31.605
and this weird sign
in the bathroom

04:31.639 --> 04:35.376
that says, "All employees
must wash their hands."

04:35.409 --> 04:38.111
And I bet they don't
reuse their straws.

04:41.915 --> 04:48.656
I am telling you, this
is not another French Ed's.

04:48.689 --> 04:53.093
These people have it
together, wake up!

04:53.126 --> 04:55.228
We do not have to
worry about losing

04:55.262 --> 04:58.966
our customers, Jackie, our
customers have to come back.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.902
They need this salt.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.771
I brought a
sample of the food.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
Schneider was giving this away.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.709
God, he is so nice.

05:08.742 --> 05:12.746
They call this their
Western Skillet Sandwich.

05:12.780 --> 05:16.149
Uh oh.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.819
Western Skillet
Sandwich my ass.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.421
That is loose meat.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.456
Those bastards
stole our sandwich.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.331
God, it's delicious.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.133
And I heard
people saying theirs

05:33.166 --> 05:36.236
was less greasy than ours.
- Oh.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.540
Well, good, then we don't
have anything to worry about.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.709
No, they like it that way.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.644
They think less
grease is better.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.478
What?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.081
Why?

05:55.523 --> 05:58.726
Oh my god, it's Schneider!

05:58.759 --> 06:03.564
Don't be taken in by the
Hollywood glitz, Jackie.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.698
What do you want, glamor boy?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.771
Just a cup of
coffee, lovely lady.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.141
I'm trying to get away
from the maddening crowd.

06:14.174 --> 06:14.975
You're open, right?

06:18.311 --> 06:21.882
Look, Schneider.

06:21.915 --> 06:25.152
Under different circumstances,
you and I, well, we

06:25.185 --> 06:26.754
might have been friends.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.055
But you're with the
enemy now, and I'm

06:28.088 --> 06:30.624
going to have to ask you
to leave, as much as I

06:30.658 --> 06:32.793
have enjoyed your
performances on television

06:32.826 --> 06:36.196
and probably film.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.565
Just wanted a cup of coffee.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.700
And you probably wanted to get
it for free just because you're

06:39.733 --> 06:41.802
some big celebrity, right?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.104
Well let me tell
you something, pal.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.606
This is not Wolfman Puck's.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.479
Is the Lanford Lunch
Box, and Hollywood types

06:51.512 --> 06:52.780
are not welcome here.

06:52.813 --> 06:57.451
Not you, not Streisand, not
even the great Don Knotts.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.953
I don't have to take this.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.021
I've got Hollywood Squares.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.330
Roseanne, you realize
what you just did?

07:10.363 --> 07:14.535
You just kicked out Schneider!

07:14.568 --> 07:17.905
Do you think I don't
know what I did, Jackie?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.840
Do you think that
doesn't kill me?

07:19.873 --> 07:22.209
Do you think that doesn't
tear my heart out?

07:22.242 --> 07:25.145
But a war what
started here today,

07:25.178 --> 07:29.082
and we didn't fire
the first shot!

07:29.116 --> 07:30.150
This is so good.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.593
Mrs. Conner, I know
you want to compete

07:39.627 --> 07:40.961
with that restaurant,
but you can't just

07:40.994 --> 07:43.664
have me draw little red hearts
next to the chili cheese fries

07:43.697 --> 07:44.932
and call it the light
and healthy menu.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.703
You're right,
David, so why not

07:49.737 --> 07:52.272
draw a picture of a
cancer-riddled colon,

07:52.305 --> 07:55.576
that'll draw them in.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.278
Who's this strange,
yet voluptuous woman

07:58.311 --> 07:59.813
hanging out in my kitchen.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.348
Hi, Dan.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.951
Oddly, she knows my name.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.986
I know, I'm sorry, I've
spending a lot of time

08:06.019 --> 08:09.089
at the diner, but I'm
going to make it up to you.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.692
There, done.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.426
Re-energized by
his wife's affection,

08:13.460 --> 08:16.129
the husband goes out to once
again confront a hostile world.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.267
OK, mom.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.335
I'm ready to go kick butt at
the other people's restaurant.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.805
Is it really run by Nazis?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.473
Yes, son, it is.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.977
And if it wasn't for them, that
whole lot would be a baseball

08:30.010 --> 08:32.813
field for kids like you.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.247
You know your line?

08:34.281 --> 08:35.716
No!

08:35.749 --> 08:37.551
Glass in the salad!

08:41.521 --> 08:43.624
Now don't use any more
of those blood capsules,

08:43.657 --> 08:46.126
or you'll have to bite
down on real glass.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.027
OK.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.296
Roseanne, he's only 14.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.331
That's the beauty of
it, he can't do time.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.335
And look.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.637
That restaurant
doesn't know it yet,

08:56.670 --> 09:00.040
but they are about to start
on a brand new campaign.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.644
We'll cook any pet.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.345
I'm guessing you
for the little puppies

09:05.378 --> 09:07.881
and kittens, David.

09:07.915 --> 09:11.284
It's cute, the way
you made them dance.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.620
They're in a frying pan!

09:15.522 --> 09:16.924
Roseanne, look, I'll
make a deal with you.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.459
If you calm down until
after the baby's born,

09:19.492 --> 09:23.063
I'll let you shoot out
tires from the porch.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.665
Oh, poor Dan.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.300
You feel like I'm
neglecting you.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.136
Sort of.

09:29.169 --> 09:33.607
Well, I didn't forget
about your dinner, OK.

09:33.641 --> 09:36.209
I bought you a whole bunch
of sandwiches from the diner.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.244
And guess what, Dan?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.311
They're healthy now.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.782
Show him the menu, David.

09:41.815 --> 09:45.686
Why don't I just get a
job with the tobacco lobby?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.254
OK, Dan, here you go.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.256
Eat up, because you didn't
come by for lunch today,

09:49.289 --> 09:50.924
so you must be starving.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.593
Actually, I'm still kind
of full from breakfast.

09:53.627 --> 09:54.594
Yeah, how can that be?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.163
You only had a handful
of Frankenberry

09:56.196 --> 09:58.431
and a Kraft single.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.401
Well, I got some from the
vending machines at work.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.637
Man, them peanut butter
cracker things are filling.

10:03.671 --> 10:04.938
Ate them all day long.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.078
All day, huh?

10:14.347 --> 10:17.718
Say, what number would those
be on the vending machine?

10:17.751 --> 10:20.020
I guess B3?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.488
That's wrong, that's
the Clark bar.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.627
Try again.

10:27.661 --> 10:28.595
J6.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.496
The O Henry.

10:29.529 --> 10:33.100
Any idiot knows that.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.069
You at that
restaurant, didn't you?

10:36.103 --> 10:38.238
Roseanne, I would never--

10:38.271 --> 10:41.775
the reason I didn't come into
the diner today was because--

10:41.809 --> 10:43.911
well it's just--

10:43.944 --> 10:44.745
I'm having an affair.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.116
Liar!

10:49.149 --> 10:50.784
You ate at that restaurant!

10:50.818 --> 10:51.719
No, I swear, it's true.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.787
Look, lipstick on my collar.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.589
That's ketchup!

10:56.623 --> 10:59.092
All right, all right!

10:59.126 --> 11:00.761
I had lunch there!

11:00.794 --> 11:04.564
But it was just one time, and
it didn't mean anything to me.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.166
I swear.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.601
You're going to make
this up to me, Dan Conner.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.470
You and all your
buddies from that garage

11:10.503 --> 11:11.839
are going over that
restaurant, you're

11:11.872 --> 11:14.241
sitting by the salad bar, and
you're going to French kiss

11:14.274 --> 11:16.476
all through lunch.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.511
Roseanne, if you want to
compete with these people,

11:18.545 --> 11:21.114
why don't you just offer good
food at reasonable prices?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.382
What, and stoop
to their level?

11:22.415 --> 11:25.185
Never.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.255
You need professional help
that I just can't afford.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.357
You know, they
can come after me,

11:30.390 --> 11:31.892
and they can come
after my business.

11:31.925 --> 11:35.328
But by God when they come after
my family, that is personal.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.307
Hey!

11:47.340 --> 11:49.309
I'm not finished.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.577
Oh.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.411
Sorry.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.417
You know, Roseanne,
this is ridiculous.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.954
There is no reason for
us to be here this late.

12:00.988 --> 12:01.855
Yes there is.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.290
Them.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.026
they stay up until midnight,
we will stay up until 2:00.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.861
If they put one of our
men in the hospital,

12:07.895 --> 12:11.464
we'll put one of
theirs in the morgue.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.432
Hey!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.600
What happened to the coffee?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.634
What-- ha ha!

12:14.667 --> 12:16.970
What-- what are you
yelling at me for?

12:17.004 --> 12:20.908
You know, yeah, I had a little
coffee, what's it to ya?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.043
Person's working late,
she needs a little boost.

12:23.076 --> 12:23.944
You know.

12:23.977 --> 12:27.047
Get off my back!

12:27.080 --> 12:29.749
You know, Roseanne, we are
not in competition with them.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.020
Our chief rivals are the
dumpsters behind McDonald's and

12:33.053 --> 12:34.654
Tommy's House of Organ Meat.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.495
I mean, not only do they
have a drive-through window,

12:42.529 --> 12:44.464
but they also have
that salad bar.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.133
For God's sakes.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.168
Nobody is going
to even remember

12:48.201 --> 12:54.074
their salad bar when they
find out about our waffle bar.

12:54.107 --> 12:58.278
Roseanne, normal people
don't want a waffle bar.

12:58.311 --> 13:03.450
Normal people are appalled
at the idea of a waffle bar.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.351
Why?

13:04.384 --> 13:05.485
We've got the good waffles.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.419
We've got eggos!

13:09.089 --> 13:11.258
Anyway, at least I came
through with something.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.960
What happened to the
celebrity you promised me?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.327
Where is Burt Reynolds?

13:14.361 --> 13:17.931
Doing "Man of La
Mancha" in Green Bay.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.134
But I'm pretty sure I
can get Keanu Reeves.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.937
Oh, how do you
know Keanu Reeves?

13:23.971 --> 13:24.872
Not important.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.945
OK, all right.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.580
The fat guy with
the dog just left,

13:33.613 --> 13:35.849
so that means they're down to
two customers, we've got three,

13:35.883 --> 13:36.749
so we win!

13:36.783 --> 13:38.118
We win!

13:38.151 --> 13:39.019
No, you can't go.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.220
Please, no, you can't go.

13:40.253 --> 13:43.256
Have you tried our
new waffle bar?

13:43.290 --> 13:45.425
I don't want your
stupid waffles.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.295
I'm going across the street,
they got cappuccino over there.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.696
Well, great.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.165
Why don't you just go ahead and
walk right over there you big,

13:52.199 --> 13:53.666
bald-headed coffee
drinking queen!

14:00.140 --> 14:00.941
Sit!

14:04.511 --> 14:06.646
OK, that's it, good night.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.648
I'm not sticking around
for just two customers.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.051
If you need me, here's my pager.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.586
The number's right on the side.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.456
They're staying open
for two customers!

14:16.489 --> 14:17.891
No, no, no, no, no.

14:17.925 --> 14:21.561
They are staying open for their
drive-through window business.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.297
We don't have a
drive-through window.

14:24.331 --> 14:29.402
I realize that, but
we have a waffle bar.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.339
But they have a
drive-through window.

14:32.372 --> 14:37.744
But we have the
reputation in this town.

14:37.777 --> 14:38.878
Right.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.515
As the place without a
drive-through window!

14:42.549 --> 14:45.452
OK, you want a drive through
window, I'll give you a--

14:45.485 --> 14:48.321
[glass breaking]

14:49.957 --> 14:50.757
Next!

15:05.072 --> 15:07.174
Don't you think you've carried
this competition thing a little

15:07.207 --> 15:08.075
too far.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.242
Can't we just go home?

15:09.276 --> 15:10.643
No.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.280
I'm mean, call me old fashioned,
but I do believe in standing up

15:13.313 --> 15:14.481
for what's right.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.949
That's the American way.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.650
That's why we're
breaking in here.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.519
I am an ex-cop.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.189
I swore to uphold the law.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.025
Well, you also swore
to stay married to Fred.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.793
Face it, you're evil.

15:26.826 --> 15:27.927
Let's milk it.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.839
Oh, Roseanne, look at
this place, we're finished.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.841
Look at this.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.545
No shoes, no shirts, no service.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.015
Well, la di da.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.818
Clean and sparkly,
and it smells so lemony.

15:51.851 --> 15:56.056
And what goes better
with lemons than fish?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.525
Rotting, smelling fish.

15:58.558 --> 15:59.692
I can't believe
the grocery store's

15:59.726 --> 16:01.828
going to throw those out.

16:01.861 --> 16:05.999
(WHIMPERING) Ew, ew.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.700
Here, Jackie, think fast.

16:07.734 --> 16:12.505
Ugh, oh Roseanne!

16:12.539 --> 16:16.843
Hey, there's that
damn salad bar.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.479
What's that you
say, little fella?

16:19.512 --> 16:22.982
You want to be in a spot
close to the anchovies?

16:23.016 --> 16:25.485
Well, go, be with your people.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.689
Come on, let's go
in the kitchen.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.232
Oh, it's so clean.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.837
Yeah, forget county hospital,
I'm having the baby here.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.044
Well, let's get started.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.646
First, a little mood lighting.

16:57.084 --> 16:57.884
Roseanne.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.465
Hey.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.434
Oh, I found the perfect spot.

17:17.704 --> 17:18.905
JACKIE: No, don't-- don't.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.407
No, you're going
to hurt yourself.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.109
Oh, come on, Jackie,
it's not like this

17:22.142 --> 17:25.812
is the first time I've ever
done anything like this.

17:25.845 --> 17:29.416
I just need to reach
up here, to this--

17:33.052 --> 17:34.287
oh.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.122
Oh my god.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.160
Oh my god.
- What?

17:40.193 --> 17:41.128
Oh my god.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.095
What?

17:42.129 --> 17:43.830
Oh my god!

17:43.863 --> 17:45.064
What?
What?

17:45.098 --> 17:46.065
- Oh my god!
- What?

17:46.099 --> 17:46.966
What?

17:46.999 --> 17:49.369
I'm stuck!

17:49.402 --> 17:51.304
You're stuck?

17:51.338 --> 17:52.272
Yeah!

17:52.305 --> 17:53.306
Get me outta here!

17:53.340 --> 17:54.207
Don't!
Don't!

17:54.241 --> 17:55.142
Don't!

17:55.175 --> 17:58.578
Just-- just calm,
just relax, no--

17:58.611 --> 18:03.750
just go limp, and then you'll
slide right out of there.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.684
[roseanne screams]

18:04.717 --> 18:07.120
[scream] How--

18:07.154 --> 18:08.621
how did you get stuck.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.423
By my boobs.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.659
They folded down on the
way up, but then they

18:12.692 --> 18:14.194
locked like those toggle bolts.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.698
All right.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.301
All right, this is the plan.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.370
I am going to flee the
scene, you fend for yourself.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.007
You're not going anywhere.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.009
You better pray my
water doesn't break.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.579
I will-- I'll get you out.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.647
I will get you out.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.883
Just-- I know!

18:36.916 --> 18:39.519
I'll turn on the stove, and
then the metal in the vent

18:39.552 --> 18:40.520
will expand.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.256
(SHOUTING) I'm
standing on the stove!

18:43.290 --> 18:45.325
It's amazing to have
your head stuck in a vent

18:45.358 --> 18:47.560
and still not be the
stupidest person in the room.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.400
OK.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.067
I have an idea.

18:55.101 --> 18:58.505
I'm going to use this Crisco to
grease you out of the chimney.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.207
Did you hear what I just said?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.843
I'm going to use this Crisco, to
grease you out of the chimney.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.546
Roseanne, we should
just face it.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.515
This place is going to beat
us, we should just give up.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.449
No!

19:09.482 --> 19:10.983
We're not giving up!
- Roseanne!

19:11.017 --> 19:11.984
I'm not giving up!

19:12.018 --> 19:13.520
I've been through
this once already,

19:13.553 --> 19:15.388
remember that motorcycle shop?

19:15.422 --> 19:17.457
I'm going to let that
happen with a diner!

19:17.490 --> 19:18.825
Roseanne.

19:18.858 --> 19:23.196
Stop petting me, you're
making me feel self-conscious.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.431
I'm gonna--

19:24.464 --> 19:28.568
I'm gonna lube you up now.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.502
And, uh.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.310
And then I'm going to
try and pull you out,

19:37.344 --> 19:38.778
on the count of three, OK?

19:38.811 --> 19:39.679
Uh huh.

19:39.712 --> 19:40.713
Are you ready?

19:40.747 --> 19:41.614
Yeah.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.815
All right.

19:42.849 --> 19:48.120
One, two, three.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.290
[roseanne screaming]

19:50.323 --> 19:51.190
Jeez.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.059
Half of Illinois
probably thought

19:53.092 --> 19:54.661
they were hearing an air raid.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.795
You think it was
loud out there,

19:55.828 --> 19:56.896
you should have
heard it in here.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.164
That's it.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.499
That is it.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.234
I'm going to call Dan.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.502
You need somebody
with a tool belt,

20:02.535 --> 20:05.705
and it's either got to
be him or Schneider.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.641
Oh man, Dan's been accusing
me of being nuts all week

20:08.675 --> 20:10.109
and this is just the
sort of thing he'll

20:10.142 --> 20:11.311
twist to fit his argument.

20:14.714 --> 20:15.648
Hey.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.883
What's that looking at me?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.217
Shoo!

20:18.251 --> 20:19.118
Shoo!

20:19.151 --> 20:20.453
You're not getting this fish.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.362
I'm sorry about the
whole restaurant bit.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.030
I lost my mind, I guess.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.099
It's just I really care
about this restaurant,

20:33.132 --> 20:36.303
I don't want to see it go down.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.371
I'm starting to
go crazy aren't I?

20:38.405 --> 20:40.507
Sometimes I think the
whole world is doing

20:40.540 --> 20:42.709
this great big choreographed
dance around me,

20:42.742 --> 20:44.444
and I'm just standing
there watching it.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.547
We'll be OK, and nobody's
doing a big choreographed dance

20:47.580 --> 20:48.481
around you.

20:48.515 --> 20:49.316
All right?

20:54.020 --> 20:57.990
[cash register ticking]

20:58.024 --> 21:08.067
[rhythmic clinking and slapping]

21:08.067 --> 21:18.077
[rhythmic clinking and slapping]

21:37.430 --> 21:40.166
What was that?

21:40.199 --> 21:41.934
Never mind.
