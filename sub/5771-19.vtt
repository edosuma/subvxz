00:02.236 --> 00:04.305
[dramatic music]

00:04.338 --> 00:07.175
(Mindy)
HISTORICALLY, BREAKUPS DO NOT
BRING OUT THE BEST IN ME.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.776
[yells]

00:08.809 --> 00:10.044
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
[yelling]

00:10.078 --> 00:11.212
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.681
[shouting]
STOP, STOP, STOP.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.383
[sobbing quietly]

00:15.416 --> 00:16.517
BUT I COULD ALWAYS
THROW MYSELF INTO WORK

00:16.550 --> 00:17.718
TO STEM THE HEARTBREAK.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.753
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

00:19.787 --> 00:25.059
THIS TIME, THERE'S LITERALLY
NOWHERE TO HIDE.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.060
GOOD MORNING.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.395
MORNING.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.533
OKAY.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.203
DANNY, I LOVE YOU.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.437
COME ON.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.373
AND THAT'S JUST
ON THE WAY TO WORK.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.408
TWO TO THREE MINUTES
THAT YOU HAVE,

00:40.441 --> 00:41.475
AND SO YOU HAVE
TO MAKE SURE

00:41.509 --> 00:42.543
THAT YOUR PATIENTS KNOW...

00:42.576 --> 00:44.312
(Mindy)
EVERY OFFICE MEETING

00:44.345 --> 00:46.514
IS A DELICATE BALLET
OF AWKWARDNESS.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.349
(Peter)
YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN
INTO ANY COMPLICATIONS.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.283
HEY, MINDY, TAKE A SEAT.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.185
OH, NO, NO.
I'M GONNA STAND.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.786
(Morgan)
THERE'S A SPACE
RIGHT NEXT TO DR. C.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.089
YOU'RE NOT IN GOOD ENOUGH
SHAPE TO STAND.
NAH.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.424
SIT RIGHT THERE.
THERE'S AN OPEN SEAT.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.226
I SYNTHESIZE MATERIAL
BETTER STANDING.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.161
YOU'RE MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE.
JUST SIT DOWN.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.429
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WILL TAKE A KNEE.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.598
I SAW THIS
IN A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL MOVIE.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.700
OKAY. SO WHERE WAS I?
RIGHT.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.103
YOU ONLY HAVE CORD BLOOD
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.304
A GOOD WAY
TO REMEMBER THINGS,

01:10.338 --> 01:11.505
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THEY REFER TO...

01:11.539 --> 01:12.773
(Mindy)
THERE IS NO ESCAPE.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.841
WHICH IS WHY, DORIS,

01:13.874 --> 01:15.709
I AM SITTING
IN THE HOT PIPE ROOM,

01:15.743 --> 01:17.378
EATING MY LUNCH
BY MYSELF.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.846
YOU'RE SITTING
ON MY BUCKET.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.215
OH.
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.388
YOU KNOW, DORIS, YOU COULD
JOIN ME FOR LUNCH HERE.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.256
TABLE FOR TWO.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.890
WE COULD TALK
ABOUT BOYS AND STUFF.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.393
I'M SORRY, SOMEONE DEFECATED
IN ONE OF THE URINALS,

01:32.426 --> 01:33.761
AND I GOTTA GO
TAKE CARE OF IT.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.330
GO.
GO, GO, GO.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.771
[hip-hop music]

01:50.844 --> 01:51.945
OH, NO.
OKAY.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.415
THIS IS WOMEN'S DEODORANT.
THIS IS NOT MY DEODORANT.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.317
THERE'S NO WAY
THIS IS GONNA BE STRONG ENOUGH.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.585
MISS, I'M SORRY,
IS THIS YOURS?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.387
NO.
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.455
I'M SORRY, I THINK
I'VE USED YOUR DEODORANT.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.556
AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE MINE.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.358
IT'S A MILITARY-GRADE
MEN'S ROLL-ON?

02:04.392 --> 02:06.460
NO, IT'S NOT MINE.
I DON'T SWEAT.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.495
OH, MY GOD.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.863
YOU'RE SHEILA HAMILTON
OF HAMILTON HEALTH PARTNERS.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.632
I JUST READ YOUR PROFILE
IN VANITY FAIR.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.268
OH, I CANNOT BELIEVE
ANNIE LEIBOVITZ

02:14.302 --> 02:16.204
GOT ME TO WEAR NOTHING
BUT BUBBLES FOR THAT SHOOT,

02:16.237 --> 02:17.505
BUT YOU KNOW ANNIE.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.872
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SURE.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.708
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
DELIVERING NORTH WEST?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.343
THEY BARELY EVEN
NEEDED ME.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.179
I MEAN, KIM'S CANAL
IS SPECTACULAR,

02:25.213 --> 02:27.181
AND KANYE'S
TENDER BIRTHING RAP

02:27.215 --> 02:28.282
REALLY JUST DID THE REST.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.651
THE CLOSEST I'VE EVER HAD
TO A CELEBRITY PATIENT WAS--

02:30.684 --> 02:31.485
DO YOU REMEMBER TRISHELLE

02:31.519 --> 02:33.454
FROM REAL WORLD/ROAD RULES:
INFERNO?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.455
OH.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.489
HER MOM WAS A PATIENT

02:35.523 --> 02:37.291
UNTIL SHE LET ME GO.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.193
WELL, I CAUGHT
YOUR TWINS DELIVERY TODAY,

02:39.227 --> 02:41.495
AND I MUST SAY,
I THOUGHT YOUR TECHNIQUE

02:41.529 --> 02:42.496
WAS AMAZING.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.864
YOU DID?

02:43.897 --> 02:46.700
I HAVE GOT MY EYE
ON YOU, DR. LAHIRI.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.202
OH, YOU KNOW MY NAME.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.403
IT'S WRITTEN IN MAGIC MARKER

02:49.437 --> 02:51.372
ON YOUR RATHER LARGE BAG
OF POTATO CHIPS.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.243
I'M GONNA EAT THAT
OVER THE COURSE

02:55.276 --> 02:57.478
OF A MONTH, SO...

02:57.511 --> 02:59.313
(Danny)
MINDY, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO SHOW US?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.514
[champagne cork pops]

03:00.548 --> 03:01.582
OW.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.583
OH, GOD.
OH, GOD.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.851
I'M SO--
I'M SO SORRY.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.419
I JUST THINK
THAT WE SHOULD START

03:05.453 --> 03:06.520
A CHAMPAGNE SPRITZER
HAPPY HOUR

03:06.554 --> 03:08.922
TO PROVIDE SOME MUCH NEEDED
GLAMOUR TO THIS OFFICE

03:08.956 --> 03:10.858
AND MAYBE ATTRACT
SOME NEW PATIENTS.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.226
I LIKE MY BOOZE
TWO WAYS ONLY--

03:12.260 --> 03:13.694
STRAIGHT UP
AND BY MYSELF.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.296
OKAY.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.265
BUT I THINK THIS WOULD ADD
SOME CLASS TO THE PRACTICE,

03:17.298 --> 03:18.766
AND IT WOULD ATTRACT
SOME MOVERS AND SHAKERS.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.867
I DON'T WANT
TO NAME-DROP,

03:19.900 --> 03:21.502
BUT LAST NIGHT
I WAS TALKING

03:21.535 --> 03:23.404
TO SHEILA HAMILTON.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.406
UGH, HOLLYWOOD HAMILTON?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.840
SHE'S THE WORST.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.776
ALSO, WHY IS
SHE TALKING TO YOU?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.244
YOU'RE NOT FAMOUS.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.879
MAYBE BECAUSE
I'M A GOOD DOCTOR.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.180
ALSO, I AM VERY FAMOUS.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.449
REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FEATURED
IN THOSE TV COMMERCIALS

03:35.483 --> 03:36.717
FOR MAMMA MIA!
ON BROADWAY?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.452
MAMMA MIA?
MORE LIKE "MAMA LIKEY."

03:38.486 --> 03:39.687
IT WAS
THE BEST BIRTHDAY EVER.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.256
WE WERE DANCING
IN THE AISLES.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.724
SHEILA HAMILTON
IS SO FULL OF HERSELF

03:43.757 --> 03:45.559
JUST 'CAUSE
SHE TREATS CELEBRITIES.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.960
OH, WRONG TACK, PETE.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.429
LOOK HOW HER FACE LIGHTS UP
WHEN YOU SAY "CELEBRITY."

03:48.462 --> 03:49.863
NO, IT DIDN'T.
IT DIDN'T LIGHT UP.

03:49.897 --> 03:50.931
YES, YOU ARE.
A LITTLE BIT.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.366
YOU LIT UP.
RATHER.
LIT UP.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.367
I DIDN'T LIGHT UP.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.602
JUST BE MUTED,
OKAY?

03:54.635 --> 03:57.405
BE MUTED LIKE ME.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.707
I THINK WE GOT PLENTY
OF GLAMOROUS PATIENTS HERE.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.042
MRS. HERNANDEZ NAMED
THEIR DAUGHTER "CASHMERE."

04:02.075 --> 04:02.976
YEAH, SHEILA HAMILTON

04:03.010 --> 04:05.313
IS NOTHING
BUT A PUFFED-UP STAR SNOGGER.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.414
I THINK SHE'S VERY NICE,

04:06.447 --> 04:08.582
AND SHE COMPLIMENTED
MY TWINS DELIVERY.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.983
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME

04:10.017 --> 04:11.452
YOU GUYS COMPLIMENTED
ANY OF MY WORK.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.653
YOU DON'T PRAISE SOMEONE

04:12.686 --> 04:14.054
FOR DOING A JOB
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.823
THAT'S WHY I REFUSE TO CLAP
WHEN AN AIRPLANE LANDS.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.391
[cell phone vibrating]
(Jeremy)
HOLD ON, THAT'S ME.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.428
OH, MY GOD,
SHE'S HERE!

04:20.461 --> 04:22.363
WE CAN STOP TALKING
ABOUT THIS BOLLOCKS.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.196
FOLLOW ME.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.598
YOUR LIVES ARE ABOUT
TO BE CHANGED.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.599
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.967
OH.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.404
I GIVE YOU THE FUTURE
OF MOBILE GYNECOLOGY:

04:30.438 --> 04:31.772
OUR NEW MEDICAL BUS.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.007
THIS SIGN SUCKS.
WHAT?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.142
IT'S LIKE

04:35.175 --> 04:37.678
SOME SOAP OPERA STAR,
A MEXICAN DENTIST,

04:37.711 --> 04:39.046
A BEAUTIFUL INDIAN WOMAN,

04:39.079 --> 04:40.648
AND SOME KID WHO JUST
GOT BAR MITZVAH-ED.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.816
AND WHY DID YOU USE A PHOTO
OF ME WHEN I WAS SNEEZING?

04:42.850 --> 04:45.018
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR NOT
TAKING YOUR ANTIHISTAMINES.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.355
I THINK
IT'S KIND OF ADORABLE.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.323
I MEAN,
I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR

04:49.357 --> 04:51.492
THE CUTE SOUND YOU MAKE
WHEN YOU SNEEZE.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.094
[roaring]

04:54.127 --> 04:56.330
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

04:56.364 --> 04:57.665
I HATE IT.
I LOVE IT.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.033
OKAY.
IT'S EVEN SICKER
THAN I DARE DREAMED.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.101
THANK YOU, PETER.

05:01.134 --> 05:01.969

ON THE SODAS.

IF YOU GET FAT AGAIN.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.362

SO CAN YOU.

SHE'S 300 POUNDS,

DAMN IT!

05:35.035 --> 05:36.404
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY,

05:36.437 --> 05:37.738
DON'T BUY
THESE LOW-CAL MUFFINS?

05:37.771 --> 05:40.073
DIDN'T I FREAK OUT
ABOUT THIS IN THE MEETING?

05:40.107 --> 05:41.074
WHO ARE YOU?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.743
I'M SALLY PRENTICE,

HEY, I'M DANNY.
HEY.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.582
SALLY IS IN TOWN FROM TAMPA
FOR HER EDUCATION,

05:48.616 --> 05:50.117
NOT TO PARTY.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.051
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.085
EDUCATION IS GOOD.
WHAT ARE YOU STUDYING?

05:54.422 --> 05:55.623
AND 11 SATURDAYS FROM NOW,

I CAN ZAP ALL THAT KNUCKLE HAIR

WITH THE KNUCKLE HAIR.

TO MAKE NEW ONES YET, BUT--

THAT WAS...

06:11.138 --> 06:13.040
VERY COOL.
ALL RIGHT.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.408
THANKS FOR THE SODAS.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.409

06:15.443 --> 06:16.243
NO ONE GAVE THEM
TO YOU,

06:16.276 --> 06:17.845
SO THERE'S NO REASON
TO SAY THANK YOU.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.580
I WILL BE BACK LATER
FOR THE DELI MEAT.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.415
DELI MEATS ARE HOW
YOU GOT FAT THE FIRST TIME.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.998
OH, HELLO.
HOW'S IT GOING?

06:38.031 --> 06:40.167
I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU
TO SOME OF THE WOMEN

06:40.200 --> 06:41.969
IN THE OFFICE,
AND WE THINK THAT MAYBE

06:42.002 --> 06:44.638
YOU SHOULD COME BY
TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.807
OH.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.209
UH, I--
I DON'T KNOW.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.445
HEY, MIN,
WE'RE GONNA HEAD HOME.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.412
DO YOU WANT US
TO WALK YOU OUT,

06:52.446 --> 06:53.981
SO THAT HORNY RACCOON
DOESN'T FOLLOW YOU?

06:54.014 --> 06:54.982
NO, NO,
I LIKE THE ATTENTION.

06:55.015 --> 06:55.783
GET OUT OF HERE.
COOL.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.184
MINDY, IT'S JUST A QUICK TOUR.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.086
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO LET DOWN YOUR FANS.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.488
FANS?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.222
WOW.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED FANS.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.557
I'D CALL THEM MINDIANS,

07:03.591 --> 07:05.092
AND WE'D HAVE, LIKE,
A SIGNATURE GROWL.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.460
WHAT'S THAT?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.028
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL?

07:08.061 --> 07:09.129
I'LL COME BY TOMORROW.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.598
ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU THEN.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.800
SEE YOU THEN.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.167
[raccoon chittering]

07:14.201 --> 07:15.235
NOT NOW, PEPE.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.470
[raccoon chittering]

07:26.680 --> 07:28.081
EVERYONE, I HAVE
A PATIENT'S EMERGENCY,

07:28.115 --> 07:29.717
SO I'M JUST GONNA
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.684
OOH, I AM GONNA GO
WITH YOU

07:30.718 --> 07:33.020
BECAUSE IT IS FRENCH DIP DAY
IN THE I.C.U.,

07:33.053 --> 07:34.755
AND THOSE GUYS
CAN BARELY EAT.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.724
I-I--YOU CAN'T
COME WITH ME.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.659
BECAUSE THE PATIENT
IS ME.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.828
OH, YOU FINALLY DECIDED
TO GO ON LITHIUM.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.895
I THINK IT'S BRAVE.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.864
I DON'T NEED THAT.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.166
IS IT LAP-BAND?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.034
NO.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.638
IT IS NOT LAP-BAND SURGERY,
MORGAN.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.805
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.007
IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY NORMAL,

07:54.041 --> 07:54.808
AND I JUST NEED TO DO IT
BY MYSELF, SO...

07:54.842 --> 07:57.077
SHH, WE JUST
KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.714
OKAY.
OKAY.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.949
THAT WAS WEIRD,
RIGHT?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.483
MM-HMM.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.894
HELLO.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.764
CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN A WARM COOKIE?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.666
YOU NEED TO PUT SOME MEAT
ON THOSE BONES,

08:18.699 --> 08:19.900
OR YOU'LL BLOW AWAY.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.735
RIGHT?
THANK YOU.

08:21.769 --> 08:22.970
YOU HAVE SO MANY,
I'LL TAKE A COUPLE,

08:23.003 --> 08:24.638
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.639
MINDY, I'M SO SORRY
I'M LATE.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.807
I WAS ON THE PHONE
TURNING DOWN

08:26.840 --> 08:28.809
YET ANOTHER AWARD,
THE GOLDEN VULVA.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.178
ANYHOO, I SEE
YOU'VE MET GLADYS.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.846
SHE'S A PRINCETON GIRL
AS WELL.

08:32.880 --> 08:33.981
SHUT UP.
NO WAY.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.215
WELL, OF COURSE,
BACK IN THE DAY

08:35.248 --> 08:38.118
IT WAS ALL MALE,
SO I HAD TO DISGUISE MYSELF

08:38.151 --> 08:39.653
AS A MAN.
I--

08:39.687 --> 08:40.520
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GLADYS.
THANK YOU.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.823
LET'S NOT BORE MINDY
WITH YOUR STORIES.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.257
NO, THAT WAS
A GREAT STORY.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.793
AT MY WORK,
ALL ANYONE TALKS ABOUT

08:45.826 --> 08:47.294
IS NHL REALIGNMENT.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.929
WHOA, WHAT IS THIS?

08:48.962 --> 08:51.665
DO YOU HAVE A YOGA STUDIO HERE?
MM-HMM.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.567
PARDON MY FRENCH,
BUT THIS PLACE IS BITCHIN'.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.068
BUT YOU KNOW,
ALL THE AMENITIES IN THE WORLD

08:55.102 --> 08:55.969
DON'T MEAN A THING

08:56.003 --> 08:57.905
UNLESS THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE
COMES FIRST.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.641
LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW WE TREAT OUR PATIENTS.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.810
SILK OR RAW SILK?

09:02.843 --> 09:04.344
THEY'RE BOTH FAIR TRADE.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.647
I DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT FAIR TRADE.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.882
I'M SORRY?
[clears throat]

09:08.916 --> 09:09.883
I DO CARE.
YEAH.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.184
DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE TOPIC

09:11.218 --> 09:12.886
'CAUSE I FIND IT BORING.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.988
THESE ARE AMAZING.
AW.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.591
OH, SO I'M GONNA GO GET--
WE'RE DOING--

09:17.625 --> 09:18.592
RIGHT.
I'M GONNA GO--

09:18.626 --> 09:20.594
OKAY, COOL.
YEAH.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.630
DANNY, PETER, PACK UP.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.297
THE MOBILE MAMMOGRAPHY BUS

09:24.331 --> 09:25.833
IS ALL GASSED UP
AND SANITIZED.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.601
ALSO, THERE'S GONNA BE
A PHOTOGRAPHER

09:27.635 --> 09:29.703
FROM A SPANISH LANGUAGE
NEWSPAPER THERE,

09:29.737 --> 09:32.640
PROVIDED WE DON'T GET BUMPED
FOR A PARADE RIOT.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.675
SO, PETER, HOW'S YOUR SISTER
HOLDING UP IN THE BIG CITY?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.710
THAT IS THE SECOND TIME

09:36.744 --> 09:38.045
THAT YOU'VE INQUIRED
ABOUT MY SISTER,

09:38.078 --> 09:39.747
AND IF THIS PATTERN
CONTINUES,

09:39.780 --> 09:40.748
I'LL KILL YOU.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.850
(Jeremy)
WH-WH-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:42.883 --> 09:45.052
THE BUS LEAVES
IN FIVE MINUTES.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.053
COME ON.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.621
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

09:47.655 --> 09:49.289
[sighs]
PETER AND I ARE BUDS.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.058
WE WERE GONNA GET
SCUBA CERTIFIED TOGETHER.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.093
WHY WON'T HE LET ME
DATE HIS SISTER? WHY?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.395
ANY GIRL WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOUR SCULPTED BODY,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.698
EVEN A GIRL WHO'S BEEN
UNDER YOUR NOSE ALL--

09:57.731 --> 09:59.199
(Danny)
WHAT ABOUT ME? WHAT ABOUT ME?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.734
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH ME?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.135
WELL, MAYBE DR. P
DOESN'T LIKE YOU

10:02.169 --> 10:03.737
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO INTOLERANT.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.973
I MEAN, YOU NEVER LET ME
TAKE OFF THE HIGH HOLIDAYS.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.708
YOU'RE NOT JEWISH, TAMRA.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.809
HOW DO I KNOW
IF I WANT TO BECOME JEWISH

10:08.842 --> 10:09.542
IF I'VE NEVER
TRIED IT?

10:09.576 --> 10:10.978
I DON'T NEED
ANYONE'S PERMISSION

10:11.011 --> 10:12.145
TO DATE SALLY
EXCEPT HER

10:12.179 --> 10:13.714
AND MY MOM, OKAY?

10:13.747 --> 10:14.715
NO, NO, WHY DO DOCTORS
KEEP ON LEAVING?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.650
DANNY, THE BUS.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.218
AND WHERE'S MINDY?

10:18.251 --> 10:21.388
I NEED A MAGIC FLUTE
FOR YOU PEOPLE.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.424
OH, ZANDRA,
THIS HEAD MASSAGE IS AMAZING.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.828
BUT HAVE WE SAVED ENOUGH TIME
FOR THE PELVIC EXAM?

10:27.861 --> 10:28.829
ALL DONE.

10:28.862 --> 10:29.930
WHAT?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.865
AND THIS IS A MODEL
OF YOUR UTERUS

10:31.899 --> 10:33.867
FROM OUR 3-D PRINTER.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.737
I USE MINE
TO RAISE SUCCULENCE.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.005
BETWEEN THE SMOOTHIE

10:38.038 --> 10:40.307
AND THE KINDLY OLD GHOST
WHO HANDS OUT COOKIES

10:40.340 --> 10:43.276
AND THE NAIL ART BAR,
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.277
WELL, MAYBE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.679
MAYBE WE COULD
FIGURE OUT A WAY

10:45.713 --> 10:46.747
FOR YOU TO STAY HERE.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.415
ARE YOU OFFERING ME
A JOB?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.718
I THINK OUR PRACTICE
COULD MAKE YOU THE DOCTOR

10:50.751 --> 10:51.785
YOU WERE MEANT TO BE.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.420
WHEN I FIRST MET ZANDRA,

10:53.453 --> 10:54.688
SHE WAS A DISGRACED DOCTOR

10:54.722 --> 10:56.857
WITH A HIGHLY UNFORTUNATE
CRUISE LINE.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.458
AND NOW I'M FLYING
TO WASHINGTON

10:58.491 --> 11:00.761
TO GIVE SASHA AND MALIA
THE TALK.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.594
OH, MY GOSH.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.797
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DECIDE NOW.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.366
WE'LL GO TO LUNCH LATER,
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.704
WELL, WELL, WELL.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.739
WHAT THE HELL?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.240
[gasps]

11:13.273 --> 11:14.141
THIS IS HAMILTON PARTNERS.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.409
MINDY, WHAT, ARE YOU
SNEAKING AROUND ON US?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.447
I WASN'T
AT HAMILTON HEALTH PARTNERS.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.415
NO, I WAS USING THE LOCKSMITH
ON THE FIRST FLOOR.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.117
DID YOUR LOCKSMITH
MAKE THAT?

11:24.151 --> 11:27.054
BECAUSE I WOULD RECOGNIZE
YOUR UTERUS ANYWHERE.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.355
ANYWHERE!

11:28.388 --> 11:29.923
YOU WERE SNEAKING AROUND
WITH ANOTHER PRACTICE?

11:29.957 --> 11:31.759
MORGAN, HOW DID YOU
EVEN KNOW WHERE I WAS?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.894
I TOLD YOU, YOU'RE ALWAYS
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE MY LIES.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.062
YOU LEFT A TRAIL
OF CRUMBS.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.730
AND THAT'S NOT
HOW I FOUND YOU, FYI.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.932
I'M FRIENDS WITH EVERY NURSE
IN MANHATTAN!

11:38.966 --> 11:41.401
DID IT FEEL GOOD?
DID YOU GET OFF ON IT?

11:41.434 --> 11:43.470
DID YOU GET
YOUR ROCKS OFF ON IT?

11:43.503 --> 11:45.305
THAT CHEATING FEELING
FEEL NICE?

11:45.338 --> 11:47.107
OKAY, THAT'S GROSS,
PETER.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.976
AND YES, I DID
GET MY ROCKS OFF ON IT.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.111
AND IT DID FEEL GOOD,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:51.144 --> 11:53.446
THEY WERE NICE TO ME,
AND THEY APPRECIATED ME,

11:53.480 --> 11:56.016
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR YOU STUPID BUNCH.

11:56.049 --> 11:56.850
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
GUYS, FORGET IT.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.151
IF MINDY WANTS TO GO,
LET HER GO.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.153
THAT IS NOT OUR POLICY,
DANNY.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.454
MINDY, GET ON THE BUS
RIGHT NOW.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.290
THIS BUS IS LEAVING
IMMEDIATELY.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.959
WE CAN SCOLD YOU ON THE WAY
TO SPANIARDS' HARLEM.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.961
HOW DARE YOU, SIR?
I WILL NOT GET ON THAT BUS.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.096
YOU CAN SCOLD MORGAN.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.031
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.966
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA GO HAVE LUNCH
WITH HAMILTON HEALTH PARTNERS,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.035
AND I'M SURE
IT'LL BE VERY EXPENSIVE.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.104
LET HER GO, GUYS.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.271
SHE'S DEAD WEIGHT ANYWAY.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.440
I DON'T WEIGH ANYTHING.
I'M LIKE A CLOUD.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.842
BYE, DANNY.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.543
DON'T--
WHY?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.945
A RAIN CLOUD.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.979
WHY?

12:28.882 --> 12:29.917
(Danny)
FREE BLOOD PRESSURE AND--

12:29.950 --> 12:32.886
LADIES, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED SOME SCREENINGS.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.720
EXCUSE ME, SENORITA.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.022
WOULD YOU WANT
TO COME ON THIS BUS

12:35.055 --> 12:37.090
AND HAVE US EXAMINE
YOUR BREASTS?

12:37.124 --> 12:38.258
COCHINO!
WHOA!

12:38.291 --> 12:39.927
OH!
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.094
SHE CAST A SPELL ON ME!

12:41.128 --> 12:42.562
GO AND TELL
ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.998
NO ONE IS COMING
ON THE BUS.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.399
WELL, I GUESS
A GROUP OF WHITE GUYS

12:46.433 --> 12:48.568
OFFERING FREE BREAST EXAMS
IN THE BARRIO

12:48.601 --> 12:49.970
MIGHT BE A TOUCH SINISTER.

12:50.003 --> 12:50.938
IS THIS THE BUS

12:50.971 --> 12:52.940
WHERE MEN CAN LOOK
AT THE WOMEN'S BREASTS?

12:52.973 --> 12:54.141
HOW MUCH IS A TICKET?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.475
GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.509
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET HIM OUT. GET HIM OUT.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.444
GO TO A PEEP SHOW.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.545
(Mindy)
THIS IS JUST EXCITING

12:58.578 --> 13:00.080
FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.115
TO MINDY. WELCOME.
THANK YOU.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.450
I WAS SURE
IT WAS GONNA TAKE

13:03.483 --> 13:04.551
A LOT MORE
WINING AND DINING

13:04.584 --> 13:06.119
TO GET YOU TO SAY YES.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.988
OH, NO.
DID I GIVE IN TOO EASILY?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.189
I ALWAYS DO THAT.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.590
IT'S LIKE WHEN
THAT TELEMARKETER CALLED ME

13:10.623 --> 13:12.059
AND I WENT
ON A DATE WITH HIM.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.161
THEN HE DUMPED ME, BUT...

13:14.194 --> 13:16.129
OH, MINDY.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.298
MINDY, WE HAVE NEEDED
SOMEONE WITH YOUR...

13:18.331 --> 13:19.532
[inhales sharply]

13:19.566 --> 13:20.901
SPICE.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.269
[mouth full]
MY PATIENTS,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.137
THEY'RE GONNA FLIP OUT
FOR YOUR PRACTICE.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.973
DO YOU THINK
THAT MANY OF YOUR PATIENTS

13:26.006 --> 13:28.141
ARE GONNA BE ABLE
TO FOLLOW YOU?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.142
UH, THEY BETTER
FOLLOW ME

13:29.176 --> 13:29.877
IF THEY WANT
TO KEEP GETTING

13:29.910 --> 13:31.011
MY RAUNCHY
HOROSCOPE EMAILS.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.147
WHICH REMINDS ME, I SHOULD
GET YOUR EMAIL ADDRESSES.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.050
MM, YOU DO KNOW THAT
WE DON'T TAKE INSURANCE, RIGHT?

13:37.084 --> 13:38.551
EX-SQUEEZE ME?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.888
WELL, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE
ALL OF OUR PREMIUM SERVICES,

13:40.921 --> 13:42.956
WE NEED TO HAVE OUR PATIENTS
PAY OUT OF POCKET.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.092
OUR KEGEL TONING MACHINE
HAS TO BE SERVICED

13:45.125 --> 13:47.260
AT THE SWISS MONASTERY
WHERE IT WAS BUILT.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.462
BUT MOST OF MY PATIENTS CAN'T
AFFORD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.364
WELL, MINDY,
YOU'LL GET NEW PATIENTS.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.033
THE RICH AND FAMOUS
NEED MEDICAL HELP

13:53.066 --> 13:54.601
JUST AS MUCH
AS ANYONE ELSE,

13:54.634 --> 13:56.336
MAYBE EVEN MORE SO,

13:56.369 --> 13:58.638
BECAUSE THEY ALL
HAVE HERPES.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.974
MAN, IT'D BE AWESOME

14:01.008 --> 14:02.976
TO TREAT POP STARS
FOR THEIR VENEREAL DISEASES...

14:03.010 --> 14:05.112
YES.
BUT THOSE PATIENTS HAVE
BEEN WITH ME FOR YEARS.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.981
GOD, CONSCIENCE,
WHY WON'T YOU LET ME DO THIS?

14:08.015 --> 14:09.416
I'M SO SORRY.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.650
THANK YOU
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY,

14:10.683 --> 14:12.619
BUT I CANNOT ABANDON
MY PATIENTS.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.321
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.189
SHEILA,
BEFORE I LEAVE,

14:16.223 --> 14:17.958
WILL YOU NAME-DROP
ONE MORE TIME?

14:17.991 --> 14:19.392
KATHERINE HEIGL.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.429
OH, YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.132
[cell phone vibrating]

14:25.165 --> 14:26.433
(Peter)
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

14:26.466 --> 14:28.001
IS THAT ONE OF MINDY'S
RAUNCHY HOROSCOPES?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.903
IF YOU ASK ME, THEY'VE
REALLY FALLEN OFF LATELY.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.505
UH, IT'S JUST NOTHING.
IT'S MY MOM.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.674
SHE TOOK A PIC
OF A REALLY BIG MEATBALL

14:34.707 --> 14:36.043
SHE'S MAKING FOR DINNER.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.244
I LOVE PICTURES OF FOOD.
LET ME SEE.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.478
OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT A--IT'S NOT A--

14:38.511 --> 14:39.346
I'M NOT SHOWING ANYBODY THIS.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.647
WHY ARE YOU HOLDING ON
TO THIS SO TIGHT?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.049
I WANT TO SEE
THE MEATBALLS, MAN.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.650
IT'S MY MOM'S FAVORITE RECIPE.
DON'T--

14:43.683 --> 14:45.052
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S YOUR MOM'S RECIPE.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.386
I WANT TO SEE
THE MEATBALLS.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.088
PETE, PETE, PETE,
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.
WHOA!

14:48.121 --> 14:49.422
DON'T LOOK.
THOSE ARE NOT MEATBALLS.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.924
PUT IT DOWN, PETE.
THOSE ARE BOOBIES.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.325
PUT IT DOWN. PUT IT--
I'M SENDING THEM TO MYSELF.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.394
DON'T SEND THEM--DON'T SEND THEM
TO YOURSELF, PETER.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.196
FINE, DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY'RE IN THE BANK.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.098
DON'T PUT THEM
IN YOUR BANK.
MMM.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.133
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES,
I SEE THEM.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.070
PETE, IT'S YOUR SISTER.
IT'S SALLY.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.238
WHAT?

15:05.272 --> 15:06.239
[gagging]
OH, MY GOD. OH, NO.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.340
SHE JUST SENT THIS
TO ME.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.341
OH, NO, I JUST--

15:08.375 --> 15:09.342
I'M SORRY, PETE.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.343
I JUST SAW
MY SISTER'S BOOBS.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.178
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.712
I WAS TURNED ON
BY MY SISTER'S BOOBS.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.114
I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE SENT ME THAT.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.083
I JUST--
ARE YOU HAVING A THING
WITH SALLY?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.084
I ASKED YOU NOT TO.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.085
I'M SORRY, PETE.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.087
I CAN EXPLAIN.
OH, PETE, JUST--

15:20.120 --> 15:21.521
LADIES, PLEASE.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.056
WE ARE
LICENSED PROFESSIONALS.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.424
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.026
YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF
MY SISTER'S BOOBS ON YOUR PHONE.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.727
PETE, WE LOOK AT BOOBS
ALL DAY LONG.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.296
COME ON!
THE BUS IS A TRICK!

15:29.329 --> 15:31.531
THEY WANT TO TAKE
NAKED PICTURES OF OUR BREASTS,

15:31.564 --> 15:34.101
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN
GIVING OUT T-SHIRTS.

15:34.134 --> 15:34.968
NO--THAT IS TRUE,

15:35.002 --> 15:36.169
BUT NOT THE FIRST PART
WHAT YOU SAID.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.004
THIS GUY IS HERE

15:37.037 --> 15:39.172
TO PHOTOGRAPH
OUR CHARITY WORK, OKAY?

15:39.206 --> 15:40.640
(Morgan)
LET'S POSE.
THANK YOU, SIR.

15:40.673 --> 15:41.441
VERY KIND.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.976
NO, MY EDITOR SAID
THERE WAS A RIOT

15:43.010 --> 15:44.244
TO SHUT DOWN A PERVERT BUS.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.113
NO! DON'T SAY THAT!
PERVERT!

15:46.146 --> 15:47.280
[crowd yelling]

15:47.314 --> 15:48.115
OW!

15:48.148 --> 15:50.550
I GOT HIT IN THE HEAD
BY A CHURRO.

15:53.120 --> 15:53.920
BETSY, TAMRA, GUYS,

15:53.953 --> 15:56.123
WHAT IS ALL MY STUFF
DOING OUT HERE?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.457
MY ANDERSON COOPER
PILLOW?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.026
IT IS KILLING ME
TO THROW OUT YOUR STUFF,

15:59.059 --> 15:59.859
DR. LAHIRI.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.229
I KNOW THAT EVEN
TOUCHING YOUR STUFF

16:02.262 --> 16:03.630
IS A PINCHABLE OFFENSE.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.398
DAMN RIGHT IT IS.
OW! OH.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.500
THE DOCTORS CALLED
AND SAID YOU'RE A DIRTY CHEAT,

16:07.534 --> 16:09.202
SO YOU CAN'T
WORK HERE ANYMORE.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.203
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.371
AND AS A WOMAN OF COLOR--

16:11.404 --> 16:13.173
UH-UH.
DAMN IT.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.676
SHEILA!
SHEILA.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.411
ALL RIGHT.
I'M BACK.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.547
I LET YOU SWEAT IT OUT
A LITTLE BIT,

16:20.580 --> 16:21.414
AND YOU TOTALLY BOUGHT IT,

16:21.448 --> 16:23.516
BUT NOW I'M HERE
TO MAKE MY COUNTEROFFER.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.517
MINDY--

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.188
I WILL KEEP ALL
OF MY PATIENTS WITH INSURANCE.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.256
I WILL, HOWEVER,

16:29.289 --> 16:31.258
TAKE A MODEST
PAY DECREASE.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.560
MINDY, I'M SORRY.
WE'VE MOVED ON.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.561
WHAT?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.063
WE'RE READY
FOR YOUR INTERVIEW,

16:36.096 --> 16:37.564
MISS SUNDARAM.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.632
WAIT.
WHO ARE THEY?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.567
WHEN YOU TURNED US DOWN,

16:40.600 --> 16:43.136
WE HAD TO GET ON
WITH HIRING SOMEONE ELSE.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.438
AND THEY JUST HAD TO BE
AN INDIAN WOMAN?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.607
OKAY, I CAN SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.608
I'M NOT DUMB.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.610
I'M IGNORANT, SURE.
VERY.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.079
BUT I'M NOT DUMB,
SHEILA.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.146
POTATO, PO-TAH-TO.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.182
WE'RE PUTTING UP
A NEW BILLBOARD,

16:55.215 --> 16:57.784
AND WE WANT IT TO BE
AS DIVERSE AS POSSIBLE.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.187
THIS IS WHY YOU TRACKED ME DOWN
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.055
YOUR MILLIONAIRES
NEEDED A SLUMDOG.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.157
AND YES, THAT IS
EXACTLY THE KIND OF

17:04.191 --> 17:06.159
"DOROTHY PARKER MEETS
FAMILY GUY" SENSE OF HUMOR

17:06.193 --> 17:07.594
THAT I WILL BE
TAKING WITH ME,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.229
FOR I WILL BE
NO ONE'S TOKEN.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.464
CLEARLY YOU ARE
THE TOKEN WOMAN

17:11.498 --> 17:12.532
AT YOUR PRACTICE.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.533
HOW DARE YOU?

17:13.566 --> 17:14.534
I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW

17:14.567 --> 17:15.768
THAT WHEN DR. SHULMAN
HIRED ME,

17:15.802 --> 17:17.537
HE BELIEVED ME TO BE
AN EFFEMINATE BLACK MAN,

17:17.570 --> 17:20.073
SO THE JOKE IS ON YOU.
[cell phone chimes]

17:20.107 --> 17:23.310
AH, MY FRIENDS NEED MY HELP.
MM-HMM.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.844
[cell phone chimes]

17:24.877 --> 17:27.414
DAMN IT.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.449
WELL...

17:32.452 --> 17:34.354
[crowd yelling]
CALM DOWN.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.588
WE JUST WANT TO EXAMINE
YOUR BREASTS.

17:35.622 --> 17:36.823
YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM ME.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.525
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?
DANNY.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.493
DANNY, DID YOU GO ON YOUR RANT
ABOUT THE LATIN GRAMMYS AGAIN?

17:40.527 --> 17:41.728
THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN CATEGORIES

17:41.761 --> 17:42.862
AT THE REGULAR GRAMMYS.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.164
COME ON, MAN!

17:44.197 --> 17:45.465
WHAT ABOUT THE POMP
AND MAJESTY

17:45.498 --> 17:46.866
OF ALL THE LATIN DRESSES?

17:46.899 --> 17:49.302
HEY, THAT'S
BRUNO MARS' NIGHT.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.370
THAT'S BRUNO MARS' NIGHT.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.373
BOO! WE DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, TRAITOR!

17:53.406 --> 17:54.641
[quietly]
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.343
I CAN NOT GET CANED
BY ANOTHER ABUELITA.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.344
WHAT ARE YOU--
DUDE--

17:57.377 --> 17:58.345
[cane thunks]
[yells]

17:58.378 --> 17:59.346
YOU ARE GOING TO JAIL!

17:59.379 --> 18:00.447
YOU ARE GOING
TO JAIL!

18:00.480 --> 18:01.681
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.550
PLEASE, EVERYBODY,
LADIES, JUST LISTEN TO ME.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.717
I AM SO SORRY.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.486
AND I KNOW THAT THESE GUYS
SEEM LIKE A BUNCH OF PEDOS.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.487
WHAT?

18:07.520 --> 18:08.721
OH, GOD,
YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO ME

18:08.755 --> 18:10.323
BECAUSE NONE OF YOU
SPEAK ENGLISH.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.459
OKAY.
HOLA, SENORITAS.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.395
DONDE ESTA BIBLIOTECA?

18:15.428 --> 18:17.497

[speaking Spanish]

18:20.200 --> 18:21.368
YEAH, SI, SI.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.535
BUT I PROMISE YOU

18:22.569 --> 18:24.171
AS THEIR FRIEND,
THEY ARE HARMLESS.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.172
IF ANYTHING,

18:25.205 --> 18:26.506
THEY'RE JUST LAME-O MELVINS.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.508
[speaking Spanish]

18:28.541 --> 18:30.577
AND THEY JUST CAME HERE TODAY
TO PROVIDE YOU

18:30.610 --> 18:31.444
WITH FREE MEDICAL CARE.

18:31.478 --> 18:35.582
[speaking Spanish]

18:35.615 --> 18:36.783
AND FOR THE RECORD,

18:36.816 --> 18:38.885
A LOT OF DOCTORS WOULD NOT
GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO DO THAT.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.420
[speaking Spanish]

18:40.453 --> 18:41.554
SO PLEASE,
GO ON YOUR MERRY WAY...

18:41.588 --> 18:42.555
[speaking Spanish]

18:42.589 --> 18:43.823
AND I PROMISE YOU,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.458
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THESE LITTLE ESTUPIDOS.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.727
[speaking Spanish]
STUPID PEOPLE.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.596
POINT IS,
THEY'RE NOT PEDOS.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.264
NO SON PEDOS.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.332
AND THAT SHOULD NEVER
HAVE COME UP.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.333
YEAH.

18:53.366 --> 18:57.637
[applause]

18:57.670 --> 18:59.372
THAT WAS AMAZING.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.507
THAT WAS AMAZING,
AND I'M SO SORRY

19:00.540 --> 19:01.508
WE TOOK YOU FOR GRANTED.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.742
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE--

19:02.775 --> 19:04.511
YOU'RE LIKE
THAT OLD, COMFY CHAIR,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.213
WHICH YOU KIND OF HATE
AND IT KIND OF SMELLS,

19:06.246 --> 19:07.414
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU'RE LIKE,

19:07.447 --> 19:08.515
"WHERE'S LUMPY?"

19:08.548 --> 19:09.716
THAT'S VERY INSULTING,
ACTUALLY.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.218
COME HERE,
YOU LITTLE BUTTHEAD.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.219
OW! STOP!
NOOGIE!

19:12.252 --> 19:13.620
STOP NOOGYING ME!

19:13.653 --> 19:14.621
CAN I BE HONEST, THOUGH?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.390
I DO KIND OF WISH WE HAD
AT LEAST ONE NEW PATIENT

19:17.424 --> 19:19.259
OR ONE PHOTO,
WHICH WASN'T CAREER-ENDING.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.827
TODAY WAS A WASHOUT.
I SAY WE CUT OUR LOSSES.

19:20.860 --> 19:21.694
OH! OH!
JUST GIVE ME--

19:21.728 --> 19:22.495
GIVE ME A SECOND.

EXCUSE ME, MISS?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.399
HEY, THAT'S SUCH

HEY, WE'RE PROVIDING
FREE MEDICAL CHECKUPS

19:31.404 --> 19:32.739
IF YOU WANT TO PARTAKE.

OKAY.
YEAH?

19:34.241 --> 19:35.107
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
OKAY.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.643
CAN YOU JUST QUICKLY
TAKE A PHOTO WITH US?

19:36.676 --> 19:37.844
YES, YES.
GET IN, GET IN.
EVERYBODY, GET IN.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.446
IT WON'T APPEAR
IN ANYTHING WEIRD,

19:39.479 --> 19:40.447
WE PROMISE.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.314
KEEP LOOKING AT THIS ONE.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.181

THANK YOU.

THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE--

19:48.888 --> 19:50.590
[grumbles]

19:50.623 --> 19:52.225
OKAY.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.493
COME ON, MAN.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.794
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.796
WHAT WOULD BE SO BAD
ABOUT ME DATING YOUR SISTER?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.331
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH MINDY.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.766
SALLY'S JUST
YOUR REBOUND.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.334
AND IF MY SISTER
WERE TO EVER END UP

20:01.368 --> 20:02.935
DATING YOU,
YOU'D JUST LEAD HER ON,

20:02.969 --> 20:04.737
AND THEN
YOU'D BREAK HER HEART.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.606
[cell phone vibrates]

20:06.639 --> 20:07.807
OKAY.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.875
WHAT TEXT
DID YOU JUST GET?

20:08.908 --> 20:09.942
[sighs]

20:09.976 --> 20:10.943
YOUR SISTER'S
GOT REAL PROBLEMS.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.480
OH, MY GOD.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.481
UGH.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.682
(Mindy)
YES, TASHA,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.250
WE DO TAKE GEORGE LOPEZ'S
HEALTH INSURANCE.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.618
[sighs]

20:18.651 --> 20:21.354
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE MAKE ANY MONEY AT ALL.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.355
SEE YOU SOON.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.791
YEAH, SEE YOU SOON.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.993
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.661
THE PATIENTS WOULD
REALLY MISS YOU.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.630
AND WHO WOULD REMIND ME
TO GET A HAIRCUT?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.565
[chuckles]
THANKS, DANNY.

20:32.599 --> 20:36.002
HEY, UH, I HOPE
IT WASN'T WEIRD FOR YOU BEFORE

20:36.035 --> 20:37.003
WITH SALLY.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.640
OH, UM...

20:40.673 --> 20:43.410
NO, IT'S OKAY.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.545
YOU DO NEED
A HAIRCUT, THOUGH.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.415
(Morgan)
GO.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.282
(Jeremy)
TIME TO GO.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.618
THANKS TO MINDY,
WE HAVE ONE NEW PATIENT.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.785
LET'S NOT LOSE HER.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.422
YOU'RE WELCOME,
EVERYBODY.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.425
I AM DRIVING.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.426
NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.960
WHY? BECAUSE I'M
THE TOKEN WOMAN?

21:00.993 --> 21:02.629
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE
A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.397
OH, BECAUSE
I'M THE TOKEN ASIAN?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.299
OKAY, DRIVE.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.500
I HAD A LITTLE MORE
FIGHT IN ME,

21:07.534 --> 21:08.535
BUT THANK YOU
FOR ACQUIESCING.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.069
NO PROBLEM.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.037
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.271
WHOO!

21:14.073 --> 21:15.775
NO SEAT BELTS REQUIRED,
BOYS.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.010
IT'S GONNA BE
A SWEET AND GENTLE RIDE.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.579
OH, GOD,
EVERYTHING IS A BLIND SPOT.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.013
EVERYBODY,
PUT YOUR SEAT BELTS ON!

21:21.047 --> 21:23.483
[tires screech]

21:23.516 --> 21:24.784
[shouting]

21:24.817 --> 21:27.019
AAH!
MINDY!

21:28.020 --> 21:29.856
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
NO ONE DIED.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.491
I THINK.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.593
(man)
GO TO BED.
