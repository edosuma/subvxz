ASHLEE:
<i>Losing Maddie and Mackenzie</i>

00:10.244 --> 00:11.945
<i>has got to be</i>
<i>the closest thing for Abby</i>

00:11.945 --> 00:13.046
to losing her own children.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.648
Abby has locked herself
into the bathroom.

00:15.883 --> 00:16.783
She needs to be a grown‐up.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.385
Abby, are you okay?

00:18.385 --> 00:20.254
ABBY LEE: <i>I don't think</i>
<i>they have any idea</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:21.388
the kind of stress
that I'm under.

00:21.388 --> 00:22.656
I am not allowing
this woman

00:22.656 --> 00:25.792
to talk to my
child like that.
You're so mean!

00:25.792 --> 00:27.494
I'm leaving.
Jill! Jill!

00:27.494 --> 00:29.496
What have we become?
We're moms.

00:29.496 --> 00:31.899
<i>We're gonna be a sinking ship</i>

00:43.911 --> 00:46.413
Mackenzie, you will be doing
a gymnastic routine.

00:46.413 --> 00:48.448
I do gymnastics
every single time.

00:48.448 --> 00:49.816
So, then, you're not
gonna do a solo.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.585
Oh, my God!

We have not had
a good pyramid in weeks,

showed up,

01:21.281 --> 01:22.983
gave out the dances.

ASHLEE:
I know. So is anybody
else quitting this week?

01:25.152 --> 01:27.120
No.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.455
ASHLEE:
Whether Abby
admits it or not,

01:28.455 --> 01:29.723
I think hearing that

01:29.723 --> 01:31.525
Maddie and Mackenzie
were leaving affected her.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.226
JILL:

01:33.226 --> 01:35.662
the ALDC elite competition team

Come here, girls.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.641
(sniffling)

01:47.641 --> 01:50.277
I think, deep down,
Abby won't admit it,

01:50.277 --> 01:52.846

01:52.846 --> 01:54.214
<i>that Maddie and Mackenzie</i>

<i>and her kids</i>
<i>for the next couple weeks,</i>

02:05.592 --> 02:08.028

02:08.028 --> 02:10.664
Last week. Great number.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.966
"The Huntsman: Winter's War."

02:12.966 --> 02:16.036
<i>It was big, it was epic,</i>
<i>it was fabulous...</i>

02:16.036 --> 02:18.238
<i>it was second overall</i>
<i>high score.</i>

02:20.574 --> 02:21.575
(sighs)

02:21.575 --> 02:22.576
Second.

02:24.211 --> 02:25.946
What did we do
the week before that?

02:27.447 --> 02:29.049
We didn't win.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.953
Maybe it's just our time, girls.

02:34.054 --> 02:36.289
If you won every
single competition,

02:36.289 --> 02:38.358
you don't need to work as hard.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.860
I think you can do better.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.564
At the bottom of the pyramid...

02:44.564 --> 02:46.233
we have JoJo.

02:51.238 --> 02:53.807
I just feel that you were
a bit distracted.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.042
She did the group dance.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.343
She did good.
She, like...

02:56.343 --> 02:58.211
It was a good week for her.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.548
Well, then, we'll move her.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.317
(cheering, laughing)

03:06.720 --> 03:08.021
I like that!

03:08.021 --> 03:09.923
JESSALYNN:
<i>I am shocked.</i>

03:09.923 --> 03:11.892
I thought,
when she took the picture off,

03:11.892 --> 03:14.061
she was gonna, like,
throw it on the floor

03:14.061 --> 03:15.495
and tell me to get out.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.331
<i>But honestly I think Abby</i>

03:18.331 --> 03:20.600
<i>is trying to, like,</i>
<i>butter me up a little bit.</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:22.235
<i>Now that Maddie and Mackenzie</i>
<i>are leaving,</i>

03:22.235 --> 03:23.570
<i>I think Abby is realizing</i>

03:23.570 --> 03:26.506
<i>that JoJo could be</i>
<i>one of her next big stars.</i>

03:26.506 --> 03:28.008
That's why she did it.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.178
Next, we have Brynn.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.551
Right, there you go. See?

03:37.551 --> 03:38.885
Next, we have Mackenzie.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.956
I've been raising you

03:42.956 --> 03:44.591
for years now,

03:44.591 --> 03:46.059
"Don't cry, don't cry,
don't be a crybaby."

03:46.059 --> 03:48.495
But there comes that time

03:48.495 --> 03:49.663
when you're playing a role

03:49.663 --> 03:51.398
<i>where you need to dig down deep</i>

03:51.398 --> 03:53.967
<i>and remember something</i>
<i>that made you sad,</i>

03:53.967 --> 03:54.968
that brought you to tears.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.305
And then we have Nia.

03:58.305 --> 04:01.508
I definitely saw emotion in you.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.976
<i>You're a strong girl,</i>

04:02.976 --> 04:05.712
<i>but I saw you become frail.</i>

04:05.712 --> 04:07.180
It was great,
I thought you did a great job.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.348
I told you that.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.451
And... Kendall,

04:11.451 --> 04:13.920
Maddie.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.123
Next, we have Kalani.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.259
Maddie and Kalani,
congratulations.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.460
You were our big winners.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.963
<i>I saw the intensity.</i>

04:22.963 --> 04:23.997
<i>You were great.</i>

04:23.997 --> 04:26.933
So we go to the second place.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.335
Maddie and Kendall,

04:28.335 --> 04:29.569
<i>I was on the edge of my seat.</i>

04:29.569 --> 04:32.105
<i>I saw what a duet should be.</i>

04:32.105 --> 04:33.206
<i>The number was great.</i>

04:33.206 --> 04:34.808
All right.

04:34.808 --> 04:38.545
This weekend we are traveling
to Sacramento, California

04:38.545 --> 04:43.283
to attend Xpressions
Dance Competition.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.853
JoJo, you will be doing
a solo this week.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.088
It's gonna be hip‐hop.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.656
I love you!

04:49.656 --> 04:50.891
"Million Dollar Baby."

04:50.891 --> 04:52.192
That's my girl!

04:53.660 --> 04:55.395
(laughter)

04:55.395 --> 04:58.131
Brynn, you will be doing a solo.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.933
It's also hip‐hop,

04:59.933 --> 05:03.436
and the name of
your routine is "Freak."

05:04.771 --> 05:06.907
ASHLEE:
<i>I'm excited that</i>
<i>the dance is hip‐hop,</i>

05:06.907 --> 05:09.309
<i>'cause Brynn is actually</i>
<i>a really good hip‐hopper.</i>

05:09.309 --> 05:11.778
It is important, at this point,
for Brynn to show

05:11.778 --> 05:14.781
<i>that she can do more than</i>
<i>contemporary and lyrical,</i>

05:14.781 --> 05:16.716
because the more well‐rounded
she is,

05:16.716 --> 05:18.552
the more valuable
she becomes to this team.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.290
My last solo for this week...

05:28.061 --> 05:29.129
... goes to Mackenzie.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.597
(cheering)

05:30.597 --> 05:32.432
Yay, Mackenz! Hip‐hop?

05:32.432 --> 05:36.236
Actually, you are doing

05:36.236 --> 05:39.339
"Hoedown Showdown,"
a gymnastics routine.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.507
It's what you do.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.977
Mackenzie's amazing at hip‐hop.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.313
You should let 'em
all three do hip‐hop.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.716
I have never done a hip‐hop solo

05:49.716 --> 05:52.285
<i>and I feel like I'm really</i>
<i>improving in hip‐hop,</i>

05:52.285 --> 05:54.955
so I hope she changes her mind.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.959
Okay. So, then,
you're not gonna do a solo.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.161
That's what's gonna happen.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.029
HOLLY:
Kenzie's only here
for a few more weeks.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.965
She's never done
a hip‐hop solo.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.666
She wants to do
a hip‐hop solo.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.668
I mean... It's not like
she's gonna be able

06:08.668 --> 06:10.170
to have multiple
opportunities

06:10.170 --> 06:11.504
after this season
to do a hip‐hop solo.

06:11.504 --> 06:12.572
ABBY LEE:
You know what, guys?

06:12.572 --> 06:13.640
Do whatever you want.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.875
No. Kenzie...

06:14.875 --> 06:15.942
ABBY LEE:
Nope, it's fine.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.277
I have so much
work to do.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.013
The group routine
is "Broken Dreams."

06:20.013 --> 06:22.048
Oh, my God.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.084
ABBY LEE: <i>Mackenzie will</i>
<i>soon be moving on.</i>

06:24.084 --> 06:25.552
<i>Why not take the opportunity</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:26.720
<i>to work with me</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.288
on her technique, her relevé?

06:28.288 --> 06:30.590
Her turn‐out? Her lines?

06:30.590 --> 06:31.958
<i>Dumb mistake, Mackenzie.</i>

06:31.958 --> 06:33.493
<i>Dumb mistake.</i>

06:33.493 --> 06:35.295
I... I know, honey.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.063
Kenzie,
I know.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.332
Don't worry, we won't
be here much longer.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.268
We almost had a normal pyramid

06:41.268 --> 06:42.936
without someone storming out.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.838
<i>Almost.</i>

06:48.675 --> 06:50.143

I guess Abby's not coming out.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.144
ASHLEE:
Doesn't surprise me.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.245
At least we have Gia.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.314
G, are you gonna do the group?

06:54.314 --> 06:55.348
Yeah.
Okay.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.516
Why is she

06:56.516 --> 06:57.617
upset?

06:57.617 --> 06:58.685
HOLLY:
I think part of it's

06:58.685 --> 06:59.686
Abby's ego.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.887
It's very clear.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.255
She is angry
at Melissa.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.691
Abby is being very
passive‐aggressive.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.593
<i>Abby knows full well</i>

07:14.534 --> 07:16.269
Did she tell you anything
about the group?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.338
Because I do have that music.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.341
Okay. It's called
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

07:21.341 --> 07:22.709
<i>So, that's really</i>

just falling apart.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.512
You feel bad for her

08:24.771 --> 08:26.306
No.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.532
but you're gonna do great.

28:53.532 --> 28:54.933
MACKENZIE:
<i>I'm really nervous</i>

28:54.933 --> 28:57.469
<i>because I have never competed</i>
<i>a hip‐hop solo.</i>

28:57.469 --> 28:59.171

30:52.417 --> 30:54.353
<i>but I think I killed that.</i>

30:54.353 --> 30:56.621
<i>But JoJo and Brynn, they're</i>
<i>both really good hip‐hoppers.</i>

31:03.562 --> 31:05.464
I'm so glad we got hip‐hop week
for the soloists!

31:05.464 --> 31:06.264
It was so great!

31:06.264 --> 31:07.499
Yeah, very good.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.201
I was tickled.
I thought they were all great.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.036
JILL:
They were great.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.938
Besides the fact that it
looked like JoJo danced

31:12.938 --> 31:15.073
and then JoJo danced again.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.475
I mean...
Oh, stop.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.343
She did look like
a JoJo out there!
Oh, my God.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.178
Did it or did it not?

31:20.178 --> 31:23.582
Brynn's not the next Maddie,
she's the next JoJo!

31:23.582 --> 31:24.850
I love it.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.385
Oh, my God.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.719
<i>Brynn needed something</i>

31:27.719 --> 31:30.756
on her head so she didn't
look like an inmate.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.190
It didn't mean
we wanted to be JoJo!

31:32.190 --> 31:33.759
JoJo did not invent the bow‐bow.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.661
<i>Jessalynn's just jealous,</i>
<i>because JoJo</i>

31:36.661 --> 31:39.131
was never brought in here
to be the next Maddie.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.299
<i>Brynn is the new Maddie.</i>

31:41.299 --> 31:43.168
JESSALYNN: I just
think it's hilarious

31:43.168 --> 31:45.270
that you dressed your
kid up like JoJo.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.538
You probably enjoyed it.
You're probably like,

31:46.538 --> 31:47.973
"Wow, my kid has some style
and some personality

31:47.973 --> 31:49.808
today."

31:49.808 --> 31:51.209
At least Brynn had
more choreography in it.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.211
Okay, so JoJo has
less choreography.

31:53.211 --> 31:55.080
What the hell do you
mean by that?!

31:55.080 --> 31:57.282
There was less
actual steps in her dance

31:57.282 --> 31:59.351
than the other kids had.

31:59.351 --> 32:01.453
That is stupid for you
to even make that comment.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.855
At least I don't attack your
kid's character like you...

32:03.855 --> 32:04.890
Your kid has no character!

32:04.890 --> 32:06.191
You hear it?

32:07.492 --> 32:09.494
ASHLEE:
<i>Jess is pretty much</i>

32:09.494 --> 32:11.363
bashing Brynn,
and everybody's sitting there

32:11.363 --> 32:13.598
<i>with almost a smirk</i>
<i>on their face.</i>

32:13.598 --> 32:16.067
<i>It is the most hypocritical</i>

32:16.067 --> 32:17.836
<i>I have ever seen these moms be.</i>

32:17.836 --> 32:19.738
And I am so over it.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.175
ABBY LEE:
What's the problem?

32:23.175 --> 32:26.011
Ashlee's very upset with...

32:26.011 --> 32:28.013
Jess.
With me.

32:28.013 --> 32:30.048
Well, you're still sitting
over there next to her.

32:30.048 --> 32:31.049
Why don't you get up and move?

32:31.049 --> 32:32.050
ASHLEE:
I'm happy to move.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.220
JILL:
<i>What a joke.</i>

32:35.220 --> 32:36.488
"Poor me."

32:36.488 --> 32:38.290
<i>Ashlee the victim.</i>

32:38.290 --> 32:40.158
She's a miserable bitch.

32:40.158 --> 32:43.228
She needs to lighten up
and get a grip.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.529
ABBY LEE:
What's the problem?

32:44.529 --> 32:46.131
ASHLEE: There's always
been a lot of criticism

32:46.131 --> 32:47.966
about anything that I say
about any other kids,

32:47.966 --> 32:50.168
but I do really keep it
about dance for the most part.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.870
It's dance‐related, always.

32:51.870 --> 32:53.872
And the attacks
from Jess on Brynn

32:53.872 --> 32:56.308
are very personal.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.777
Why do you care what she thinks?

32:58.777 --> 33:00.212
It just goes too far.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.980
Maybe your
comeback is,

33:01.980 --> 33:03.014
"Well, you know what?

33:03.014 --> 33:04.416
"Maybe when she's in a leotard

33:04.416 --> 33:06.451
"doing a beautiful
contemporary number,

33:06.451 --> 33:08.453
you'll want JoJo
to look like her."

33:08.453 --> 33:10.255
You know,
just let it go!

33:10.255 --> 33:12.591
Everybody over here!

33:12.591 --> 33:14.192
We got to get ready
for the group dances.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.293
Are you sewed in?

33:15.293 --> 33:16.328
We have to sew you in.

33:25.670 --> 33:30.242
So, everybody, Maddie is leaving
in just two more weeks.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.110
I mean, you've been dancing
for a long time,

33:32.110 --> 33:35.914
where Maddie's
the featured performer and

33:35.914 --> 33:37.716
your eyes go to her

33:37.716 --> 33:38.917
and she doesn't let us down.

33:38.917 --> 33:39.951
She doesn't disappoint.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.254
Who is going to do that?

33:42.254 --> 33:43.421
All right?

33:43.421 --> 33:45.223
Everybody stretched?

33:45.223 --> 33:48.226
MELISSA:
Come on, girls, go.

33:48.226 --> 33:49.861
Abby always tells us
that we need a new leader.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.596
And she wants
a new person to come in.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.665
<i>But Abby has been checked out.</i>

33:53.665 --> 33:55.934
It's kind of hard to be
a leader when your leader

33:55.934 --> 33:58.904
<i>isn't there to teach you</i>
<i>how to be a leader.</i>

33:58.904 --> 34:00.605

34:00.605 --> 34:04.042
up next, welcome to the stage,
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

34:08.647 --> 34:10.916
ABBY LEE:

would maybe say you're lazy."

to dress a kid up like Brynn,

she would just have to wear,
like, something plain
