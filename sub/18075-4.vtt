00:02.718 --> 00:06.251
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:06.345 --> 00:08.253
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:08.345 --> 00:13.170
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:13.264 --> 00:16.880
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:16.974 --> 00:20.970
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:21.059 --> 00:23.134
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

[Men Shouting]

02:04.396 --> 02:06.518
[Man]
Get him! Get him!

02:23.154 --> 02:24.731
Get him!
Okay, get him!

02:30.032 --> 02:33.234
Maim him!
Just-Just maim him!

02:37.577 --> 02:41.489
He's goin' down, Warden. This time
old Jase is gonna stop that boy for good.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.654
Keep that tape rollin'.
Three grand a copy.

02:55.627 --> 02:59.669
Okay! Okay!

02:59.754 --> 03:02.374
How do you award it?

03:04.256 --> 03:07.954
- Kill him!
- Kill him, Jase!

03:12.009 --> 03:14.795
Finish him off, son.

03:14.885 --> 03:17.457
Finish him off, boy.

03:17.553 --> 03:19.628
I don't want to do it, Mr Beale.

03:21.763 --> 03:25.213
And I don't care if you shoot me.
I won't do it.

03:51.026 --> 03:56.812
Jase, Lieutenant Trask here's
gonna give you regulation clothes, okay?

03:56.904 --> 04:01.362
And you got an hour start.
Then I gotta announce a prison break.

04:01.447 --> 04:05.657
That's our bargain.
I'm holding up my end. Better get goin'.

04:09.201 --> 04:11.276
Hold it!

04:13.286 --> 04:15.361
This here's my watch.

04:16.870 --> 04:20.368
You got exactly
one-hour head start.

04:23.624 --> 04:25.699
Go!

04:31.127 --> 04:33.795
Seem like about an hour?

04:33.878 --> 04:35.786
Let's call it in, Red.

04:35.879 --> 04:37.954
[Chattering]

04:38.047 --> 04:40.501
[On Radio]
Sneed, this is Leo.

04:40.590 --> 04:43.161
We got us a prison break.
The boy"s headin"up Carver"s Road.

04:43.257 --> 04:47.798
- You wanna see
if you can scare up a posse?
- Hey, we're mounted and ready.

04:47.884 --> 04:51.334
Out. All right,
he's on Carver Canyon Road.

04:51.428 --> 04:54.343
Now he'll be up in Box Canyon
in about five minutes.

04:54.429 --> 04:58.211
Now y'all are legalized deputies
of this county, so good huntin', huh?

04:58.306 --> 05:00.380
- Okay.
- Let's get him! Let's go!

05:05.851 --> 05:09.467
- I'll make it. I'll make it.
- [Boy] I won"t make it.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.638
I ain't got no time
to make no ashtrays.

05:13.729 --> 05:18.435
Neither do I. But since I've been put
in charge of arts and crafts, I'll make time.

05:22.608 --> 05:24.683
I gotta go.

05:26.526 --> 05:29.442
Hey, Joey, what'd you
and your mother hear from Jase?

05:29.528 --> 05:31.519
Nothin'.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.483
There he is now.

06:19.258 --> 06:23.467
- Where you been, Joey?
- I had to go down to the centre
and check in with B.A.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.588
B.A. Baracus
in a day care centre?

06:31.888 --> 06:35.006
- That big, tough dude,
what's he doin' down there?
- He's making ashtrays.

06:35.098 --> 06:37.220
It beats making trouble,
don"t it, Jase?

06:38.266 --> 06:40.590
B.A., you son of a gun.
Come on in.

06:42.851 --> 06:45.009
- How are you?
- Good, good, good, good, good, good.

06:45.102 --> 06:49.014
He tells me you busted up a bar in Florida.
Got 30 days in Strikersville.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.772
You don't know the half of it, B.A.

06:51.855 --> 06:54.689
You see, that warden,
he had a whole different plan for me.

06:54.773 --> 06:56.930
My 30 days turned into five years.

06:57.024 --> 06:59.774
- I mean, they turned
my whole life upside down.
- You busted out?

06:59.859 --> 07:01.897
Don't mess in my mud, B.A.
I'm poison.

07:01.985 --> 07:04.653
You been throwin' your life away,
that's your business.

07:04.736 --> 07:08.434
But you"re gonna get your little brother
here in trouble trying to help you.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.896
Well, he is my brother.
And I don't have anyplace else to go.

07:13.448 --> 07:15.523
[Man On P.A.]
Jase Tataro!

07:15.616 --> 07:17.406
We got you surrounded!

07:17.492 --> 07:20.906
They followed you, Joey.
Damn it, I told you to be careful.

07:20.993 --> 07:23.447
B.A., you got to get him
out of here now.

07:23.536 --> 07:26.701
We can blow you away
right here and now if you want, Jase.

07:26.787 --> 07:30.071
Save us a lot of trouble
if we did blow him away.

07:30.164 --> 07:32.653
Warden wants him in one piece...
you know that.

07:32.748 --> 07:34.740
Now you can come on out of there.

07:34.832 --> 07:37.322
No! No!
They'll kill him!

07:55.758 --> 07:58.876
- They'll kill him!
- They're killing him, Andre.

07:58.968 --> 08:01.339
They're killing a perfectly
wonderful career.

08:01.427 --> 08:03.549
I got a big-time feature
to produce.

08:03.637 --> 08:06.387
I've got agents like you
hawking me all day long.

08:06.471 --> 08:09.091
Now your client
is a big riskola.

08:09.181 --> 08:12.465
Okay, the whole Aquamaniac disaster,
we'll own that.

08:12.557 --> 08:16.055
But we all know that John
was having emotional problems.

08:16.142 --> 08:20.848
Your script... Sinbad Goes To Mars...

08:20.936 --> 08:22.844
is absolutely beautiful...

08:22.937 --> 08:27.264
and John is perfect casting
as the Martian.

08:29.231 --> 08:31.519
Uh... hmm.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.519
- Let's go. I need you.
- This, uh...

08:35.609 --> 08:38.015
One of my...
Another one of my clients.

08:38.110 --> 08:41.193
l"ll take care of the check.
l"ll phone you, Andre.

08:41.278 --> 08:44.692
That guy produces most of
the monster pictures in Hollywood.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.696
I was being my own agent.
It was beautiful.

08:47.781 --> 08:51.113
- We're on a case.
- What case? Who's the client?

08:57.410 --> 08:59.781
Oh, I see.
He"s got a lot of money, has he?

08:59.870 --> 09:04.743
He's got nothin'. His brother's about
to be murdered at a Florida prison,
and we're gonna get him out.

09:04.830 --> 09:08.078
You gotta hear this kid's story,
Hannibal. He says the warden of
that prison in Florida...

09:08.165 --> 09:10.203
is forcing the prisoners
to fight to the death.

09:10.291 --> 09:13.740
We're gonna get him out, Hannibal.
You got a problem with that?

09:13.834 --> 09:15.826
I didn't say I had a problem, B.A.
I'm just saying...

09:15.918 --> 09:20.910
if we want to stay out of the federal
slammer, we gotta screen our clients.

09:21.004 --> 09:25.580
- I'm calling for a vote.
I say we take a vote on this case.
- How can we vote on it?

09:25.673 --> 09:28.838
- We don't even know what it is.
- We vote because I say we vote.

09:28.924 --> 09:31.496
- Could we make that a secret ballot?
- No!

09:31.592 --> 09:36.335
I say we get Jase
out of prison forJoey. All in favour?

09:36.427 --> 09:38.218
I said, all in favour.

09:38.303 --> 09:42.630
Well, I, uh, uh...
You know, l...

09:43.972 --> 09:46.758
Well, sure, I'd favour that.

09:46.849 --> 09:50.050
Well, they don't let
crazy people vote.

09:50.142 --> 09:52.263
They take that right away from you
when you're committed.

09:54.477 --> 09:56.883
We are also immune to fear.

09:56.978 --> 10:01.187
We can't hook up emotionally
to the concept of cerebral damage.

10:01.272 --> 10:04.224
- I'm gettin' tired of this rap, Murdock.
- You're tired of it? How do you think I feel?

10:04.315 --> 10:06.306
I have to listen to it all day.

10:10.192 --> 10:14.318
I think it's a hell of a story.
And if we can prove it, I get front page.

10:15.611 --> 10:20.899
You see, I got this real shot at playing
the Martian in Sinbad Goes To Mars.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.153
Don't matter. You're out-voted anyway.
Come on, let's go.
We gotta get out of here.

10:27.325 --> 10:30.573
Well, kid, it looks like
you just hired the A-Team.

10:35.411 --> 10:40.284
That script stunk anyway.
I have to have some creative standard.

10:51.585 --> 10:54.454
[Hannibal] We gotta get you a cover,
Face, to get into that slammer.

10:54.545 --> 10:56.785
Get a book on prison reform.

10:58.505 --> 11:01.374
- Any book?
- No. It has to be a recent one...

11:01.465 --> 11:04.036
and by an author who's
never been published before.

11:04.132 --> 11:07.334
- We'll get copies at the book store.
- I know the routine. Let's go.

11:08.843 --> 11:10.751
Go on, son.

11:10.844 --> 11:14.542
Well, Jase said this Warden Beale
picks prisoners that are tough.

11:14.637 --> 11:17.209
Tries him out by having one of the guys
in the yard pick a fight with him.

11:17.305 --> 11:20.886
If they do well, he separates them
from the other prisoners and trains them.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.846
Then he makes them
fight to the death.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.924
Like them gladiators in Rome, man.

11:25.016 --> 11:27.091
How did Jase get away?

11:27.184 --> 11:30.551
Well, if they win, they let you go free,
and then they hunt you.

11:30.644 --> 11:32.931
They try to kill you.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.095
Jase was the first one
to get away.

11:35.188 --> 11:38.436
Jase is real tough, Hannibal.
He grew up in my neighbourhood.

11:38.522 --> 11:43.762
- He was the baddest cat around
until I showed up.
- Still is.

11:43.858 --> 11:47.391
He's my brother.
Everyone says, "Yeah.

11:47.485 --> 11:49.725
Jase, he's-he's
real tough and mean."

11:51.028 --> 11:53.897
But he's not.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.819
He's...

12:01.574 --> 12:06.317
That's okay, Joey. That's okay. I'm gonna
help you, me and my friends here.

12:06.410 --> 12:08.734
It's okay. It's okay.

12:10.203 --> 12:12.823
But what if they kill him
before you can get to him?

12:12.912 --> 12:17.987
All we can do is our best.
But we'll give it a 100% try, son.

12:18.081 --> 12:20.950
We found a book called
The Reformed Convict by Dwight Pepper.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.954
Dr Pepper?
Are you kidding?

12:25.043 --> 12:28.789
It's his first book.
He's a doctor of psychology from LSU.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.830
Face, you're the good doctor.

12:31.921 --> 12:34.671
[Hannibal] Let"s go. We"ll drop
Joey at home and get on down there.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.114
A new record...
coast to coast in 38 hours.

13:35.198 --> 13:38.861
The town's kinda small.
Somehow I expected a house or two.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.866
That's the city limits sign.
The town is up the road.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.192
Ambitious.
Lay it out for me, Face.

13:44.286 --> 13:48.447
Now, uh, Murdock, B.A., Hannibal,
you rent the car and get arrested.

13:48.538 --> 13:51.074
Now Amy and I,
we"ll scan the stuff we need...

13:51.164 --> 13:53.618
and get to you guys with
the stuff you need for the escape.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.074
We gotta break out of jail
with Jase before the fight.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.948
If we don't, then, uh,
B.A. could be in big trouble.

14:01.043 --> 14:03.449
Yeah, he"s also in big trouble
if you and B.A. get separated.

14:03.544 --> 14:07.042
If that happens, you aren't gonna win
the fight or see what's going on.

14:07.129 --> 14:10.081
Don't worry. I got a plan
that will keep us together.

14:10.172 --> 14:12.247
Let's go.
Jase could be dead already.

14:30.139 --> 14:32.261
Let her rip, B.A.

14:32.348 --> 14:34.838
Gettin' arrested in this burg
is the easy part.

14:41.477 --> 14:43.683
[Horn Honking]

14:49.981 --> 14:52.731
[Siren Blaring]

15:21.078 --> 15:23.568
Well, now, where you boys from?

15:23.663 --> 15:25.950
[Slurred Speech]
Drop dead, sir.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.535
- [Glass Shatters]
- I want these guys, Billy.

15:30.624 --> 15:34.572
Now you call Judge Bell and you tell him
that I got me some Yankees...

15:34.667 --> 15:37.536
- ploughin"through town doin" 80.
- I thought we were doin' 85.

15:37.627 --> 15:41.160
He ain't gonna like it, Norm. You know
what he said about bustin' Yankees.

15:41.254 --> 15:43.328
Nobody talks to us like that
when we been drinkin'...

15:43.421 --> 15:46.041
especially no dust-covered
country cop.

15:46.131 --> 15:50.422
All right, get 'em out there!
You're under arrest! Drunk and disorderly!

15:50.508 --> 15:54.005
- You're resisting arrest...
- Calm... Calm down, Norm! Calm down.

15:54.093 --> 15:57.175
We got big trouble, man.
They been screamin' all up the state.

15:57.261 --> 16:00.011
Now you heard thejudge. He"s gonna
send a senate investigator down here...

16:00.095 --> 16:02.087
and we are gonna get fired, man.

16:02.179 --> 16:04.171
Just get in the car and calm down.

16:10.808 --> 16:14.555
[Tyres Screeching, Engine Racing]

16:14.643 --> 16:20.097
- What's goin' on, Hannibal?
- I don't know.
But I'll bet I can change his mind.

16:20.187 --> 16:24.265
Jase could be gettin' murdered while we
stand around here trying to get arrested.

16:24.356 --> 16:26.431
Give me the keys.

17:02.372 --> 17:06.202
You're under arrest.
You're under arrest!

17:06.290 --> 17:09.788
You guys are
all goin" to jail!

17:09.876 --> 17:12.281
Thank you.

17:32.511 --> 17:34.502
All right, everybody out.

17:40.973 --> 17:43.094
Hey, you, boy,
I said get out.

17:43.182 --> 17:45.802
If you're talking to him,
you're wasting your time.

17:45.891 --> 17:48.049
He's deaf.
He's also a mute.

17:48.142 --> 17:51.759
Oh, yeah. I remember getting
a note on that from the courthouse.

17:51.852 --> 17:54.140
So which one of you two
is the interpreter, huh?

17:54.228 --> 17:56.848
Sadly, that duty falls on me.

17:56.938 --> 17:59.890
Well, tell him to stop leaving
his butt prints in my van.

17:59.981 --> 18:03.562
Sign language requires
the entire body.

18:03.649 --> 18:06.648
If you want him out of there,
you're going to have to uncuff me.

18:11.736 --> 18:13.728
[Clears Throat]

18:30.995 --> 18:35.950
- Hey. Say, what's he run, about, uh, 220?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

18:36.038 --> 18:39.785
Well, tell him to get in line and follow us
into the yard, 'cause we're gonna check in.

18:46.668 --> 18:50.450
That boy looks like a candidate
for the fight programme.

18:50.545 --> 18:52.536
Got his file?

18:57.089 --> 18:58.997
Deaf and mute?

18:59.090 --> 19:04.330
Yep. That other guy, uh, John Smith, can
talk to him. He knows that sign language.

19:04.426 --> 19:09.085
[Chuckling]
Hairdresser.

19:09.178 --> 19:13.672
You mean to tell me that animal
is travelling around with a hairdresser?

19:13.763 --> 19:15.802
I wonder if that mute's
as tough as he looks?

19:15.889 --> 19:19.303
I'll tell you what, you have
Jackhammer Jackson try him out.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.343
If he looks like he can
handle himself, l"m gonna file
assault charges against him...

19:22.434 --> 19:24.721
upgrade his sentence two years
for fighting.

19:24.810 --> 19:29.516
Soon as they get through with
the psychiatric check-in, I'll get it done.

19:30.771 --> 19:33.805
- [Murdock] Tractor.
- You don't really see a tractor,
do you, Murdock?

19:33.897 --> 19:36.387
- You're right. I was just guessing.
- Well, don"t guess.

19:36.482 --> 19:38.307
What does it look like?

19:39.358 --> 19:43.188
Ink. It looks like ink.
See, I've been doin' these most of my life...

19:43.276 --> 19:45.682
off and on...

19:45.777 --> 19:49.227
and I don't see nothin',
so I just guess.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.403
It looks like a butterfly, don't it?

19:52.489 --> 19:55.488
See, there's the wings
and there's the head.

19:57.032 --> 19:59.024
Hey.

20:00.367 --> 20:04.742
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.

20:04.827 --> 20:08.360
- Yeah, it's a butterfly!
- Good.

20:08.454 --> 20:12.117
Butterfly.
Now what do you see?

20:12.205 --> 20:14.197
Garbage bag.

20:14.290 --> 20:17.040
Empty garbage bag.

20:21.751 --> 20:26.078
I'd like a trash bag, please, if you have one.
I really could use a trash bag.

20:27.754 --> 20:32.460
All the way from Los Angeles, California,
to Strikersville, Florida.

20:32.548 --> 20:35.333
I'm doing a story on prison reform.

20:35.424 --> 20:37.878
Actually, I was supposed to meet
Dwight Pepper here.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.338
The story relates to his concepts
on prison reform.

20:40.426 --> 20:44.967
- Unfortunately, I guess
he got hung up at the airport.
- Have a seat.

20:45.053 --> 20:46.926
Thank you.

20:47.012 --> 20:51.921
Dwight Pepper? Isn't he that dude
that wrote that cream-cheese book
about coddling prisoners?

20:52.015 --> 20:53.971
Teach them how to do needlepoint,
bake biscuits?

20:54.057 --> 20:56.973
I have his book right here.

20:57.058 --> 20:59.180
I already read it.

20:59.268 --> 21:02.302
Couldn't get past the second chapter.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.267
You, uh, don't mind...

21:04.353 --> 21:08.514
if I confirm your credentials,
do you, Miss Allen?

21:08.605 --> 21:10.431
Please do.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.143
You one of the new fish, huh?

21:22.236 --> 21:24.524
- That's right.
- Turn out your pockets, boy.

21:24.612 --> 21:26.568
What you got is mine.

21:28.030 --> 21:32.156
- What's your name, friend?
- Deke, and I ain't your friend.
I'm your boss, boy.

21:34.325 --> 21:36.281
I'll tell you what you are, Deke.

21:36.367 --> 21:40.612
- You're a guy travelling Mach one
to a pine box.
- Tough guy, huh?

21:41.661 --> 21:43.818
He's a tough guy.

21:51.374 --> 21:54.077
Got a cigarette, Deke?

21:54.167 --> 21:56.324
I'll just take the pack.

21:56.418 --> 21:58.907
What have you seen
of Jase Tataro, Deke?

21:59.002 --> 22:01.456
It don't pay to ask questions
on this cell block.

22:01.545 --> 22:04.165
See ya, Deke.

22:18.094 --> 22:21.212
- Turn out our pockets, man.
- What is this, an opening ritual?

22:21.304 --> 22:25.002
I wasn't talkin' to you, punk.
I was talkin' to him.

22:25.097 --> 22:27.338
Turn out your pockets, man.

22:27.431 --> 22:29.636
Oh, he doesn't have anything
in his pockets you want.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.881
I wasn't talkin to you.
I was talkin' to him.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.891
If you're talking to him,
you are talking to me, because he's deaf.

22:34.976 --> 22:39.185
He"s also a mute.
He can"t even read lips.

22:39.270 --> 22:43.514
But if you'd like me to translate
for you, I'll be happy to.

22:43.605 --> 22:46.273
You want him to
turn out his pockets?

22:52.192 --> 22:57.184
- What did he say?
- You don't want to hear it.
It wasn't very nice.

22:57.278 --> 23:00.277
Okay, okay.

23:00.362 --> 23:05.864
He said, "Your mother works
street corners and you're so ugly,
flies wouldn't land on you."

23:05.948 --> 23:08.105
I told you it wasn"t very nice.

23:09.700 --> 23:14.988
He also said that you're
a chicken-hearted lowlife who
sleeps in pig slop, and your sister...

23:15.077 --> 23:18.325
Okay, okay. I get the point.

23:18.412 --> 23:21.411
- Three-minute rounds?
- No.

23:41.047 --> 23:46.667
Damn! I never saw such
quick combinations in my life.
That boy may be better than Jase.

23:46.758 --> 23:49.876
The only trouble is you can't talk
to him without the other guy, Smith.

23:51.551 --> 23:55.547
Tell you what...
you, uh, keep 'em together.

23:55.637 --> 23:57.711
Put 'em in the fight programme.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.879
Get on the phone,
spread the word.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.508
Saturday night, we're gonna
have a fight to the death.

24:02.598 --> 24:05.763
Tell 'em a thousand dollars
buys one seat.

24:10.476 --> 24:12.847
Mr Pepper, I don't have
no time for you today.

24:12.936 --> 24:17.227
That's Dr Pepper,
like in the "sody" pop.

24:17.313 --> 24:20.063
Hey, look, Warden, I done a little
research on Strikersville Prison...

24:20.147 --> 24:24.059
and, uh, quite frankly the incidence of
violent deaths that abound here about...

24:24.149 --> 24:29.271
suggest to me that you
have severe shortcomings
in your rehabilitation programme.

24:29.360 --> 24:34.482
I ain't about to discuss my prison with
some, uh, university, uh, "peniologist"...

24:34.570 --> 24:37.238
who don't know anything
about problems we face here.

24:37.321 --> 24:41.068
Warden Beale, I'm gonna lay this
out for you once and only once.

24:41.156 --> 24:46.314
I've been commissioned by
the Senate of these here United States
to write a thesis on several prisons...

24:46.409 --> 24:49.325
Strikersville bein"one of them,
and, uh, I must tell you, sir...

24:49.410 --> 24:53.986
that I am, uh, mighty appalled by what
l"ve discovered is goin"on down here.

24:54.079 --> 24:57.528
In the past 18 months,
there have been seven prisoners...

24:57.622 --> 25:03.574
who have died from what we might
euphemistically call "mysterious causes"...

25:03.666 --> 25:05.824
- beatings and the like.
- Not to mention...

25:05.917 --> 25:09.865
the number of prison breaks
that have resulted in the deaths
of the escaping prisoners.

25:09.961 --> 25:12.367
Miss Allen, if y'all don't mind.

25:12.462 --> 25:15.165
I would like to handle this
in my own way.

25:15.255 --> 25:18.835
I appreciate that you're down here to
chronicle my efforts in the national press.

25:18.923 --> 25:23.084
I appreciate that your findings will
be published in 70 syndicated papers...

25:23.175 --> 25:28.249
including the Washington Post,
and I am not unmindful of the public
attention y"all can put on my study.

25:28.344 --> 25:32.635
But as an academician,
I'm not here for personal glory...

25:32.721 --> 25:36.170
but to try and effect
meaningful prison reform.

25:40.557 --> 25:42.679
Seventy papers?

25:44.184 --> 25:47.930
Look, uh, I don't wanna make
enemies of you people...

25:48.019 --> 25:50.639
but, uh, you gotta understand
I got my problems here.

25:50.729 --> 25:53.681
Warden Beale, I'm not down here
to try and make trouble for you.

25:53.772 --> 25:58.810
As a matter of fact, I'd be willing
to take a look at your operation
in a very favourable light...

25:58.899 --> 26:03.973
if I was to become convinced
your rehab programmes were movin'
in the right direction.

26:04.068 --> 26:06.474
We have rehab programmes
here in Strikersville.

26:06.569 --> 26:09.568
What you got, Warden, is a laundry...

26:09.654 --> 26:12.357
and y'all punch out license plates
for the state of Florida.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.436
What do ya want from me?

26:16.532 --> 26:22.282
Well, I'd... I'd like to suggest
the implementation of what we call
"sensitivity rehabilitation."

26:22.367 --> 26:24.442
It's all in my book.

26:24.535 --> 26:26.740
You mean, uh, cooking,
junk like that?

26:26.828 --> 26:30.325
Cooking is excellent.
It's a creative endeavour.

26:30.413 --> 26:35.487
Now at Leavenworth, they've had
tremendous success with the hair-styling
concept. Absolutely incredible.

26:35.582 --> 26:39.114
It"s in my book under"Decreased Inmate
Violence Through Personal Grooming. "

26:39.208 --> 26:42.326
[Chuckling]
You... You gotta be putting me on.

26:42.418 --> 26:45.999
You mean to tell me you want me to start
a hairdressing "saloon" here in prison?

26:46.086 --> 26:47.994
How about ballet class?
You want one of those?

26:48.087 --> 26:51.536
As a matter of fact, dance class and
painting class have been quite effective...

26:51.630 --> 26:53.871
I have heard enough.

26:53.965 --> 26:57.414
That tears it. I ain't gonna
listen to no more of this.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.422
All right. All right.

27:01.510 --> 27:05.256
You, uh, you do what you like
and I'll do what I have to. Miss Allen?

27:05.345 --> 27:08.925
I can't believe you are willing
to jeopardize your entire career...

27:09.013 --> 27:11.502
because you are unwilling to experiment
with new prison techniques.

27:11.597 --> 27:14.383
- That's simply fascinating.
- [Clicks Button]

27:14.474 --> 27:17.592
Hold it.
That thing been on all the time?

27:20.435 --> 27:24.051
Dr Pepper? Uh, come on
in here a minute, will you?

27:26.937 --> 27:31.264
You know, I was just thinking.
We had a prisoner check in today
that had hair-styling experience.

27:31.356 --> 27:36.015
Thought maybe we'd give it a shot.
You come on over here,
and you tell me what y'all need.

27:36.108 --> 27:40.898
Trash bags!
I want trash bags!

27:40.985 --> 27:44.103
I want 'em! I want 'em!

27:44.195 --> 27:47.360
- I want trash bags!
- The guy hasn't shut up!

27:47.446 --> 27:49.936
I want trash bags!

27:50.031 --> 27:54.820
Don't you have any trash bags? Maybe
he'll put his head inside and suffocate.

27:54.908 --> 27:58.073
Trash bags!

27:59.868 --> 28:02.654
Oh. Trash bags?

28:03.912 --> 28:06.484
Gimme a trash bag.

28:06.580 --> 28:10.622
- I want a trash bag.
- Where do these morons come from?

28:25.588 --> 28:29.584
Hannibal, that's Jase Tataro.

28:31.424 --> 28:33.415
He's alive.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.837
Nice.

28:43.929 --> 28:48.423
But this shampoo
has no protein base.

28:48.515 --> 28:51.348
We'll have more split ends
than a football team. Ha, ha.

28:53.434 --> 28:56.931
Oh, no!
Did you buy all Harrisons?

28:57.018 --> 29:01.263
Can't do a decent blow-dry with a Harrison
Hair Pro. There's no temperature control.

29:01.354 --> 29:06.725
Mr Smith, the warden is doing
the best he can. I think Warden Beale
is being extremely cooperative.

29:08.482 --> 29:13.224
I need reclining salon chairs.
Where are my reclining salon chairs?

29:13.317 --> 29:16.850
Strikersville, Florida
don't have no Montgomery Wards.
We did the best we could.

29:16.944 --> 29:21.936
Okay, okay. Then I'll take, uh,
pool chairs or lawn chairs.

29:22.029 --> 29:25.064
The attitude of the head
is the essence of a good cut.

29:25.156 --> 29:29.815
Sneed, uh, go over and pick up
three or four of my pool chairs.

29:29.908 --> 29:31.983
Thank you, Warden.

29:37.578 --> 29:39.486
Warden Beale,
I'm most surely impressed...

29:39.579 --> 29:43.195
with the way you've gone and embraced
these new concepts in penology.

29:43.289 --> 29:46.620
I don't think there's gonna be one con
comin' here and gettin' no haircut.

29:46.707 --> 29:52.125
- Uh, you people got me over a barrel,
but, uh, I think you're nuts.
- That's what they said in Leavenworth.

29:52.209 --> 29:55.125
Now, Warden,
everybody wants to look nice.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.285
It strikes to the central core
of the human condition.

29:57.378 --> 30:01.954
When, uh, people, uh,
look nice, they act nice.

30:02.047 --> 30:04.916
And prisoner violence
will be reduced.

30:05.007 --> 30:08.587
Now if it's all right,
I'd like to see the hospital facilities.

30:16.470 --> 30:18.461
Bye-bye.

30:31.476 --> 30:35.223
How'd you like a little Mohawk trim, B.A.,
just to keep me in practice?

30:35.311 --> 30:39.141
How'd you like a little right hook, Hannibal,
just to sorta keep me in practice?

30:39.230 --> 30:43.806
[Murdock] Some more!
I want some more! I want trash bags!

30:43.899 --> 30:47.348
- What on earth is that?
- We have a new prisoner.
He wants trash bags.

30:47.442 --> 30:51.651
- Trash bags? Why?
- I don't know. I never saw
anything like it before.

30:51.735 --> 30:56.027
You give him a trash bag,
and he's quiet for a couple of hours,
and then it starts all over again.

30:56.112 --> 30:59.526
Aberrant behaviour is fascinating,
medically and clinically, isn't it?

30:59.614 --> 31:04.569
How would you know? I just found out
you're not really Dr Pepper.

31:04.658 --> 31:08.072
Not Dr Pepper?
Are you kidding?

31:08.159 --> 31:10.696
Of course he's Dr Pepper.

31:10.785 --> 31:14.484
Except I just got his book from the
warden's office not more than an hour ago.

31:14.579 --> 31:18.740
I was just getting set to read it,
and I noticed this.

31:18.830 --> 31:23.656
So the next question is, if you're not
Dr Pepper, who the hell are you, honey?

31:28.710 --> 31:31.413
That's the last time I'll be humiliated
by that damn publisher!

31:31.503 --> 31:33.494
Five years of research,
five years of writing...

31:33.587 --> 31:36.159
and Dunn and Mitchell put
the wrong picture on the dust jacket!

31:36.255 --> 31:38.661
I thought they recalled all
the wrong dust covers, Dr Pepper.

31:38.756 --> 31:40.712
They were supposed
to have been recalled.

31:40.798 --> 31:44.212
- Of course, with a New York publisher,
they'll tell you anything.
- Wrong dust cover?

31:44.300 --> 31:49.837
Yes. Of course. Clean out your ears.
Here, show her the right one.

31:49.927 --> 31:53.875
- [Sighs]
- Oh, well, this one has your picture on it.

31:53.971 --> 31:55.797
So who's this other guy?

31:55.888 --> 31:59.338
That other guy, as you so quaintly put it,
is Dr Lloyd Leedoms.

31:59.432 --> 32:01.968
He's a marine biologist
or some damn thing.

32:02.058 --> 32:05.306
Published a minor little work entitled,
Love Calls of the Pacific Grey Whales.

32:05.393 --> 32:07.183
About six people ever read it.

32:07.268 --> 32:10.885
My book, on the other hand,
is the current bible of penologists...

32:10.978 --> 32:13.812
and the publishers
mixed his photo with mine...

32:13.896 --> 32:16.433
distributed the first printing
with the wrong picture on it!

32:16.522 --> 32:19.522
- Your question is,
"How could this happen?"
- Well, no. l...

32:19.607 --> 32:21.978
My question exactly.

32:22.066 --> 32:26.477
I screamed bloody murder,
and they told me... they promised...
that all the books had been recalled!

32:26.568 --> 32:31.524
Oh, it's just devastating. Really.

32:31.612 --> 32:34.814
Writers get almost no respect.
Almost none.

32:34.905 --> 32:37.609
Would you mind if I-I took...
if I took this jacket?

32:37.698 --> 32:40.698
- No.
- I'm gonna shove it
down my editor's throat.

32:40.783 --> 32:42.858
Promised.
He promised me.

32:42.951 --> 32:46.780
- Oh, well, what's a Yankee's
promise worth anyway?
- Nothin'.

32:46.869 --> 32:51.078
Let's take a look at that
trash bag fixation, shall we?

32:58.249 --> 33:01.165
Trash bag! New trash bag!

33:01.250 --> 33:04.203
- Trash bag! Trash bag!
- Sneed, trash bag.

33:04.293 --> 33:06.415
Trash bag? Tra...

33:15.340 --> 33:17.248
What do you make of that, Doctor?

33:17.341 --> 33:20.126
Well, I'd like to spend about
an hour with him later on.

33:20.217 --> 33:23.915
I, uh, I got my doctorate
at LSU in neurotic fixations.

33:24.010 --> 33:28.883
I think in about, oh,
20 or 30 minutes I could tell you
whether this boy is really fixated...

33:28.971 --> 33:33.049
or just trying to, uh, Section Eight
into the soft walls of a hospital facility.

33:33.139 --> 33:35.463
I sure would like to
have you try, Doctor.

33:35.557 --> 33:38.556
He's been keeping everybody
on this wing up all night.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.594
Well, I'll take a shot at it
before I leave this evening.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.807
[Snapping Fingers]

34:00.735 --> 34:06.236
Tell him to take his gloves off
and hold out his wrist. He's leaving.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.891
Leaving?
Why are we leaving?

34:08.987 --> 34:11.904
Not you, just him.

34:11.989 --> 34:13.946
Tonight is fight night.

34:14.032 --> 34:18.324
He"s gonna get his chance
to fight Jase Tataro.

34:18.409 --> 34:21.277
Is the van ready, Sneed?

34:21.369 --> 34:25.744
Van? Are you kidding? I thought we were
gonna fight right here in the prison.

34:25.829 --> 34:30.370
You tell him to hold his hand out
and you shut your hole, okay?

34:30.456 --> 34:33.953
Or I'll have Sneed deck you
with his billy right here, right now.

34:34.041 --> 34:36.708
I think I should go along
to tell him what's happening.

34:36.792 --> 34:41.368
I think, uh, once he gets hit,
he'll know what's happening.

34:42.753 --> 34:45.918
Now you tell him.

35:02.929 --> 35:05.335
[Warden] Let"s hurry up.
We gotta be there in 20 minutes.

35:11.224 --> 35:13.097
Oh, damn.

35:13.183 --> 35:17.095
[Chuckling] What's the matter?
Did you lose your playmate?

35:17.185 --> 35:20.801
[Sighs]
No, I-I hate violence.

35:20.895 --> 35:23.016
I just hate it.

36:17.795 --> 36:19.916
What's going on, man?
Where we going?

36:20.963 --> 36:25.172
Well, one of us is gonna
wind up a dead man...

36:25.256 --> 36:28.754
and then the other one is gonna be
sporting game for the crowd.

36:28.841 --> 36:31.331
We gonna bust loose.
You gonna do what I say.

36:31.426 --> 36:33.382
No way out of this.

36:33.468 --> 36:38.092
I got some help. Joey hired me
and some friends to get you out.

36:38.179 --> 36:42.553
We ain't gonna get out of this one,
B.A., neither one of us.

37:33.578 --> 37:37.027
What are you doing here?
This is a restricted area.

37:37.121 --> 37:39.824
Well, do you think I like it?

37:39.914 --> 37:44.040
Doing a cut and blow-dry on a crazy man.
Warden Beale sent me up here.

37:44.124 --> 37:46.661
Well, you'll have to leave.
I have no permission for you to be here.

37:46.750 --> 37:50.331
[Face] lt"s all right. I set it up with
the warden this afternoon.

37:50.418 --> 37:53.204
I thought we'd start by getting
Mr Murdock here a better self-image.

37:53.295 --> 37:55.998
My self-image is real bad.

37:56.088 --> 38:01.375
A haircut is just what I need
in this time of severe emotional crisis.

38:01.465 --> 38:05.295
[Face] There, you see how it works?
Now y"all wanna open the door
and let that fellow come on in?

38:05.383 --> 38:07.458
Well, if you're sure, Doctor.

38:10.135 --> 38:12.127
Thank you.

38:18.848 --> 38:21.420
- Hey, what...
- Bring the trash bags, Murdock.

38:23.183 --> 38:25.091
Hey, what's going on?

38:25.184 --> 38:29.594
You feel free to yell and scream,
but there's nobody around to hear.

38:31.311 --> 38:35.058
- It's going down. We made a little error.
- What?

38:37.939 --> 38:42.184
They're not gonna fight in the gym. They
just took Jase and B.A. outta here in a van.

38:42.275 --> 38:45.689
That is not a little error, Hannibal.
That is a giant screwup.

38:45.776 --> 38:50.151
Well, in either case,
we gotta get outta here. Murdock,
you and I are gonna go over the wall.

38:50.236 --> 38:52.856
- Face, you better get outta here.
- Amy is outside in B.A.'s van.

38:52.946 --> 38:55.068
Hopefully, she had
the instinct to follow them.

38:55.155 --> 38:57.479
If she didn't, we're dead.

39:11.412 --> 39:13.404
[Motor Whirring]

39:18.165 --> 39:19.991
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:20.083 --> 39:24.030
You know, I have to admit y'all run
a much better prison here than I expected.

39:24.126 --> 39:26.034
Well, I guess I'll just
head on outta here.

39:26.127 --> 39:29.541
Uh, just have to check with
the admitting desk. One moment.

39:30.587 --> 39:35.081
[Woman] Guard!
Get me outta here! Come on!

39:35.173 --> 39:37.923
[Indistinct]

39:38.007 --> 39:44.042
Come on, now. They"re trying an escape.
Dr Pepper is in on it. Come on.

39:45.094 --> 39:47.500
- Okay.
- [Door Buzzes]

39:47.595 --> 39:49.670
- Bye.
- So long.

39:55.515 --> 39:58.005
This is Psychiatric Ward.
We've got a break situation here.

39:58.099 --> 40:00.257
Give us a lockdown
and sound the alarms.

40:00.350 --> 40:02.674
[Blaring]

40:11.022 --> 40:13.227
Murdock, how did
I let you talk me into this?

40:13.314 --> 40:17.180
I don't know. I have
intermittent memory loss. [Gasps]

40:17.274 --> 40:21.649
Whoa! Ya-hooo!

40:21.735 --> 40:23.940
Hey, great, Murdock, great!

40:25.486 --> 40:28.688
Whoa! Ya-hooo!

40:28.779 --> 40:31.981
[Laughing]

40:33.031 --> 40:35.735
Ya-hooo!

40:52.582 --> 40:56.198
To all a merry Christmas
and to all a good night.

41:22.261 --> 41:25.379
Nothing to it.
This is Smith. How you doing, kid?

41:25.471 --> 41:29.929
I'm in a field north of the prison.
There's about 50 cars in front of a barn.

41:30.015 --> 41:33.927
They just took B.A. in a few minutes ago.
Hannibal, it"s starting.

41:34.016 --> 41:36.885
Go right on the dirt road
just past Strikersville Junction.

41:36.976 --> 41:40.059
[Tyres Screeching]

41:40.144 --> 41:45.515
We got ourselves a challenger,
name of Baracus.

41:45.605 --> 41:50.762
Deaf-mute. Just checked in this week.
It's gonna be an interesting fight.

41:50.857 --> 41:54.639
He's got the fastest hands
I've seen in 20 years.

41:56.943 --> 41:59.859
Now I don't know how
to talk to you, boy.

41:59.944 --> 42:05.066
Lessen you get your hands up,
this man is gonna kill you. Go!

42:05.155 --> 42:07.727
[Yelling]

42:09.323 --> 42:11.778
Do it, man.
My people ain't gonna fail me.

42:21.620 --> 42:25.663
- There's about 50 or 60 of'em in there
and some of'em got guns.
- Well, we got a surprise for them.

42:29.749 --> 42:32.914
[Man] Get him!
I said get him, Jase! Get him!

43:08.558 --> 43:10.466
- [Man] Kill him!
- Live or die?

43:21.188 --> 43:23.559
I can't breathe.

43:23.648 --> 43:26.481
Get those legs up, sweetheart.
Put your hands in the air.

43:26.566 --> 43:29.767
You, over here.

43:35.486 --> 43:40.441
Nice little shindig, Warden.
But it's over.

43:40.530 --> 43:43.364
I c-can't breathe.

43:53.452 --> 43:55.657
Uh, uh, uh.

43:55.745 --> 43:59.029
Thanks, fellows.
I knew you wouldn't let us down.

43:59.121 --> 44:02.535
He... He ain't a mute any more.

44:02.623 --> 44:04.910
Just like you ain't a warden any more.

44:06.291 --> 44:08.082
That's for a little boy named Joey.

44:08.167 --> 44:11.285
B.A., bring him out.

44:13.753 --> 44:15.661
Murdock, grab that TV camera.

44:17.129 --> 44:21.421
Okay, everybody on their feet.

44:21.506 --> 44:23.165
It's showtime.

44:23.257 --> 44:27.916
Stand up now and toss your weapons
out into the centre.

44:28.009 --> 44:31.791
As in nice and easy.
There you go.

44:31.886 --> 44:34.885
All you boys in the front row...
you wanna sit down, face the camera?

44:34.970 --> 44:39.843
That"s right.
Wanna give everybody a chance here.

44:39.931 --> 44:43.179
Murdock, bring that TV tape
and collect Sneed.

44:43.266 --> 44:45.637
Come on, Chips, time to go.

44:50.686 --> 44:54.847
Now you all are gonna be
on the 10.00 news.

44:54.938 --> 44:58.850
It's a tough break,
but that's showbiz.

44:59.898 --> 45:02.103
Okay.

45:02.191 --> 45:05.807
- Go!
- [Machine Gun Firing]

45:16.114 --> 45:17.939
[Jase]
All right, I owe you guys my life.

45:18.031 --> 45:23.449
You know, why'd you do it? Why
did you take a chance like that for me?

45:23.533 --> 45:27.399
You had to be there.
Thank you.

45:27.493 --> 45:30.113
I wanna tell you something.
You see, the state of Florida...

45:30.203 --> 45:32.775
they dropped the rest
of the time I owe 'em...

45:32.871 --> 45:36.487
'cause that warden, he faked up those
additional charges he had against me.

45:36.581 --> 45:40.825
Great. All we ask is that you
don't ever say a word about us.

45:40.916 --> 45:45.125
We're kinda hot ourselves. There's a guy
named Colonel Lynch who's after us...

45:45.210 --> 45:48.493
- and we don't like to leave a trail.
- That's a promise.

45:48.586 --> 45:52.451
I gotta get down to the paper and proof
my story. I got front page tomorrow.

45:52.546 --> 45:54.834
- Congratulations.
- I gotta get going.
I got things to do myself.

45:54.922 --> 45:56.830
I got bed check
at the hospital in an hour.

45:56.923 --> 45:59.329
I'll drop ya. There's a new night nurse
there with definite possibilities.

45:59.424 --> 46:04.795
Night nurses at that joint all have
third-degree black belts, Face.
You touch her, she'll break your caps.

46:04.885 --> 46:07.339
Right. So, uh, Hannibal can drop you.

46:07.428 --> 46:12.419
Uh, sorry, Murdock, can't.
If I hurry, I can catch Andre at the bar.
I still want that part in Sinbad.

46:12.513 --> 46:14.505
Thanks. I'll wait in the car.

46:16.473 --> 46:19.971
Thanks, B.A. I owe you.
Anything you want.

46:20.058 --> 46:23.639
Tomorrow, you're gonna learn
to make ashtrays, okay?

46:23.726 --> 46:25.635
- [Laughing]
- Okay.

46:25.727 --> 46:28.347
- All right. All right, man.
- Thanks, man.

46:32.105 --> 46:35.472
- John is a reformed man.
- [Man On TV] This news is just in
from Strikersville, Florida.

46:35.565 --> 46:38.813
- I mean, when we talk about John Smith...
- [Man On TVContinues, Indistinct]

46:38.900 --> 46:41.733
we're talking about
a devoted actor...

46:41.818 --> 46:47.520
- who cares desperately about
the animals and the monsters he plays.
- Boy, listen to that.

46:47.612 --> 46:51.477
Warden Beale has confessed to
the crimes after being turned over
to Florida state officials...

46:51.572 --> 46:54.820
along with videotapes of the fights
he engineered between prisoners.

46:54.907 --> 47:00.064
Already 40 identifications and arrests
have been made of the men
who watched the contests.

47:02.160 --> 47:06.155
And what of the mystery men
who engineered the capture
of the warden and the film?

47:06.245 --> 47:08.486
No clues exist
as to their identity.

47:08.579 --> 47:12.196
I'd love to have the rights
to that story.

47:12.289 --> 47:16.996
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be sitting
across the table from one of the guys
who pulled off that caper.

47:17.083 --> 47:19.489
[Chuckles]

47:19.584 --> 47:21.990
- Yes, yes? What is it?
- Uh, nothing.

47:22.085 --> 47:26.496
Uh, forget it.
Bad idea.
