00:47.030 --> 00:52.024
<i>Alexis. Alexis. Alexis.</i>

01:14.424 --> 01:15.550
Will...

01:16.993 --> 01:19.052
Will, no.

01:19.529 --> 01:22.657
No, maybe we shouldn't do this.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.396
But, I mean, you're going tomorrow.

01:27.971 --> 01:29.700
I thought that you'd want to.

01:29.873 --> 01:31.272
I do...

01:31.441 --> 01:34.171
...but it's only gonna make things
harder for me.

01:37.413 --> 01:40.007
You...
I love you, you know.

01:40.216 --> 01:41.877
I know.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.178
I just...

01:45.355 --> 01:46.413
I wish that was enough.

01:47.056 --> 01:48.683
It's not?

01:50.293 --> 01:52.158
It used to be.

01:52.495 --> 01:54.122
Too many painful memories here.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.928
Look, you gotta move on
into the future, okay?

02:01.104 --> 02:02.731
That's what I'm trying to do.

02:02.906 --> 02:04.635
That's why I have to go.

02:04.808 --> 02:07.333
No, I was talking about our future.

02:10.180 --> 02:11.943
You make it sound so final.

02:15.518 --> 02:17.509
You see all this?

02:18.788 --> 02:21.382
I put the money down last week.

02:21.558 --> 02:25.085
It's mine or ours.

02:27.263 --> 02:29.754
I can't believe you did this.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.135
I just thought that
maybe you'd change your mind.

02:39.175 --> 02:42.474
It's been a year
since I lost my parents, Will.

02:42.645 --> 02:44.476
You don't know what that's like.

02:45.048 --> 02:46.982
I have to go.

04:27.383 --> 04:29.476
Oh, a taxi. How quaint.

04:34.290 --> 04:35.951
I love transfer students.

04:36.659 --> 04:38.684
Now, here's one arriving in style.

04:40.196 --> 04:45.293
"Christa Caldwell, 3.8 GPA,
transfer from Rambling College.

04:45.468 --> 04:47.265
Captain of the volleyball team."

04:47.437 --> 04:48.699
Tell me what I wanna hear.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.305
She comes from three generations
of Texas oil.

04:52.141 --> 04:53.403
That we like.

04:53.576 --> 04:55.066
Get her dorm number.

04:55.244 --> 04:58.145
Oh, my God.
- Here comes Miss Taxi.

04:59.582 --> 05:01.607
Wow. Okay, I gotta get this one.

05:01.784 --> 05:05.220
All right, here we go.
"Danielle Brooks, 4.0 GPA.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.946
And she's a government major."

05:07.123 --> 05:10.718
Aw, she sold her late parents' land
to pay for school...

05:10.893 --> 05:14.385
...and yet she's still
on a work-study program.

05:15.631 --> 05:16.962
Must have been some house.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.931
Guys, her nickname is Daisy.

05:20.103 --> 05:21.127
Aw...

05:26.976 --> 05:28.671
- Next.
- Yeah.

05:36.519 --> 05:38.817
- Need a hand?
- No, no, it's all right. Heh.

05:38.988 --> 05:42.685
You know, there's, uh, a lot to say
for a new piece of luggage.

05:42.859 --> 05:46.090
- Yeah, well, I've had this piece forever.
- Yeah, it looks it.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.527
It's not that. I mean,
we've been through a lot together.

05:49.699 --> 05:51.599
This is the luggage we're talking about?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.759
It's a long story. Heh.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.801
Well, I can see you two
have a lot of history.

05:55.972 --> 05:57.462
How is that?

05:57.640 --> 06:00.632
It's all broken up about you going
to a new school.

06:02.378 --> 06:03.504
I am so embarrassed.

06:03.679 --> 06:05.704
- Well, let me help.
- No, really.

06:05.882 --> 06:09.716
No, no, no, please,
I live for these small moments of altruism.

06:09.886 --> 06:11.683
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

06:11.854 --> 06:13.754
So are you here with anyone?

06:13.923 --> 06:16.790
No, I'm alone.
I'm looking for the girls' dorm.

06:16.959 --> 06:21.225
Alone and looking for the girls' dorm:
story of my life. Heh.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.661
I'll tell you what, why don't I save you
the agony of trying to read this map...

06:25.835 --> 06:29.396
...and give you and your 1972 luggage
door-to-door service?

06:30.773 --> 06:32.138
I'm Daisy, by the way.

06:33.209 --> 06:34.733
Blake.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.413
It's, uh, that way.

06:49.592 --> 06:52.026
Everything look good to you so far?
- Yeah.

06:52.195 --> 06:54.925
All right. Well, the, uh, library
is down there.

06:55.098 --> 06:57.931
Student Union building is over there.

06:58.768 --> 07:00.065
You're through here.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.500
Oh, my God. What happened?

07:02.805 --> 07:06.172
Uh, Alexis Baldwin.
She was a student here.

07:06.342 --> 07:09.539
Last semester she fell to her death.

07:09.712 --> 07:11.179
That's horrible.

07:12.048 --> 07:13.072
Yeah.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.312
After you.

07:26.095 --> 07:27.562
Okay.

07:27.730 --> 07:30.028
Wow, I feel so underdressed.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.224
You kidding? You look fantastic.

07:32.401 --> 07:35.063
Heh. You're just full of compliments,
aren't you?

07:35.238 --> 07:36.671
- They bug you?
- No.

07:36.839 --> 07:39.034
- Because I can change tactics.
- Heh.

07:40.309 --> 07:41.936
This is it.

07:42.478 --> 07:43.877
Great.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.237
Thanks for your help.

07:45.414 --> 07:47.006
No problem.

07:47.984 --> 07:49.884
See you around, Daisy.

07:50.586 --> 07:52.213
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:56.159 --> 07:58.650
Hi, I'm Daisy. I'm your new roommate.

07:58.828 --> 08:02.628
- Daisy?
- Well, Danielle, originally, but...

08:02.798 --> 08:04.925
Not a local, I take it?

08:05.101 --> 08:07.399
No, a little town on the outskirts
of Iowa.

08:08.037 --> 08:11.336
You're not bringing a bunch of chickens
in with you, are you?

08:12.742 --> 08:15.939
Um, you must be Margaret Hart.

08:16.112 --> 08:17.136
Magenta.

08:17.313 --> 08:19.304
Magenta, are you a film major?

08:19.482 --> 08:23.384
- Minor. Poli-sci major.
- Me too.

08:25.154 --> 08:30.114
Uh, careful with that, Daisy May.
That's a camera, not a tractor.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.662
Oh, no!

08:35.831 --> 08:38.299
- What?
- Wilbur.

08:38.467 --> 08:41.027
- Who's Wilbur?
- He's my pet tarantula.

08:41.203 --> 08:42.693
He was here just a minute ago.

08:42.871 --> 08:45.841
A freaking tarantula?
That's disgusting. Where is it?

08:47.743 --> 08:50.769
Wait, I left him at home
with the chickens.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.938
I just plum forgot about that.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.675
Heh. That's real cute.

08:57.853 --> 08:59.343
It's nice to meet you, Daisy.

08:59.522 --> 09:01.990
Nice to meet you, Magenta.

09:43.232 --> 09:44.392
That's the professor?

09:45.067 --> 09:47.058
He's not like my teachers back home.

09:47.603 --> 09:48.900
You mean cute?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.837
Ogling the teachers?

09:56.045 --> 10:00.072
Advanced Political Theory.
Mighty impressive for a freshman.

10:00.249 --> 10:01.739
Listen...

10:02.351 --> 10:04.876
...thanks for the luggage, but I can't...
- Accept them?

10:05.054 --> 10:08.888
- Candy from a stranger, that kind of thing?
- Yeah. Thank you, though.

10:09.925 --> 10:13.725
Well, tell you what, why don't you
just hang on to them for a few days...

10:14.130 --> 10:17.031
...and then when we're no longer strangers,
keep them.

10:17.199 --> 10:21.295
Morning, class,
and welcome to Advanced Political Theory.

10:21.737 --> 10:24.228
My name is Professor Andrew Graves...

10:24.407 --> 10:26.272
...and, uh, before we begin
this semester...

10:26.442 --> 10:29.468
...I wanna say a word
about the upcoming PEIP exam.

10:29.645 --> 10:32.978
That's Political and Economic Internship
Program.

10:33.149 --> 10:37.483
Eight weeks, paid,
working in Washington, D. C...

10:37.653 --> 10:41.612
...shadowing administration officials,
senators, congressmen.

10:41.791 --> 10:45.955
Let's face it, this is the Holy Grail
of political science.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.595
This is a terrific opportunity.

10:47.763 --> 10:51.096
I encourage each and every one of you
to take advantage of it.

10:51.267 --> 10:54.498
So for those who are interested,
raise your hands.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.638
I'll give you a copy of the study guide.

10:57.606 --> 11:00.097
Little eager, Miss Daisy?

11:00.276 --> 11:01.607
Mr. Graves.

11:02.011 --> 11:04.002
I didn't know you were
enrolled in my class.

11:04.880 --> 11:07.314
Actually, Professor Graves, I'm not.

11:07.483 --> 11:09.815
Just here to make sure everyone
gets their syllabi.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.687
- Well, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

11:25.668 --> 11:26.828
So...

11:27.002 --> 11:29.129
...you doing anything Friday night?
- No.

11:29.305 --> 11:30.329
Excellent.

11:30.506 --> 11:32.974
You're good, you know that?
No is the correct answer.

11:33.142 --> 11:35.770
So dinner will be at 8:00.

11:42.051 --> 11:43.848
Now, can anyone explain?

11:44.019 --> 11:46.078
That was shameful.

11:46.255 --> 11:48.223
I thought it was kind of cute.

11:48.657 --> 11:51.353
Ah, I guess it runs in the family.

11:51.594 --> 11:53.152
Anyone?

12:00.836 --> 12:02.997
I'll see you later.
- Okay.

12:08.377 --> 12:09.844
Uh, Miss Brooks?

12:10.012 --> 12:12.708
I just wanted to, uh, welcome you.

12:12.882 --> 12:16.750
I mean, you know that you're the first
underclassman that's been allowed in here?

12:16.919 --> 12:19.979
Thank you. It's nice to know
those late nights paid off.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.592
Good for you. It was a good choice
to volunteer for the internship.

12:23.759 --> 12:26.990
- That kind of program can change your life.
- That's why I'm here.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.825
Good. I just hope it's not to date my son.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.590
He is persistent.

12:32.768 --> 12:37.205
Yes. Persistently inappropriate,
to be sure.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.076
Dean Graves' office.

12:43.012 --> 12:47.381
Yes, okay, I'll get her to call you back
as soon as possible.

12:49.084 --> 12:50.108
May I help you?

12:50.286 --> 12:52.345
Yeah. Hi, my name is Danielle Brooks.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.886
I was assigned to work here.

12:54.056 --> 12:55.819
- Oh, you're the new office assistant.
- Yes.

12:55.991 --> 12:58.391
Welcome. Just give me a sec.

12:59.161 --> 13:02.619
Dean Graves, Danielle Brooks is here.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.960
- You must be Daisy.
- Yes.

13:06.135 --> 13:07.830
Please come in.

13:08.003 --> 13:10.972
Tell Miss Starr
I'm running a little late, okay?

13:13.242 --> 13:14.937
Sit down.

13:16.745 --> 13:19.543
I've had the pleasure of speaking
with your former principal.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.945
He expects to see your name
on a ballot someday.

13:22.117 --> 13:24.176
Ha, well, I'm not sure about that.

13:24.353 --> 13:28.881
I think you'll find Beckshire to be a really
good fit for someone with your potential.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.617
Well, this is the chance of a lifetime...

13:31.794 --> 13:35.059
...and I just really hope I can live up
to your expectations.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.165
Well, I'm confident you will.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.496
Thank you.

14:14.670 --> 14:18.697
Nice digs, if you've gotta live
with your mommy and daddy.

14:19.441 --> 14:23.537
- Are we breaking and entering now, Azalea?
- Just entering.

14:23.712 --> 14:25.771
I haven't broken anything...

14:25.948 --> 14:27.415
...yet.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.775
Right, well, I think that's still illegal.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.614
- Not in my world.
- Ha.

14:33.789 --> 14:37.190
Azalea's world. Such an interesting place
that must be.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.687
Wouldn't you like to know?

14:39.862 --> 14:44.231
You flatter yourself too much, Lea.
I gave up chasing you years ago.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.595
Is that how you like to remember it?

14:48.771 --> 14:50.534
Well, there were those nasty rumors.

14:50.706 --> 14:52.435
Rumors? Not familiar.

14:52.608 --> 14:57.238
Oh, no. You know, the ones
where you swore off men?

14:57.746 --> 14:59.077
Hmm.

15:03.986 --> 15:07.012
I bet you're just dying to find out.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.223
What do you want, Lea?

15:14.196 --> 15:17.131
C's and D's on my transcript.

15:19.335 --> 15:25.399
Since the arrival of your mother last year
prompted a sudden downturn in my GPA.

15:25.574 --> 15:30.170
Really, I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
Maybe you should try...

15:30.379 --> 15:32.813
...I don't know, studying for a change.

15:32.982 --> 15:36.247
Of course, I'm sure you'll find a way
to persuade your professors.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.411
Easy ones have been transferred
to different schools.

15:41.323 --> 15:45.123
Sorry, Lea, can't change your grades.

15:46.962 --> 15:48.725
We'll get to that.

15:49.098 --> 15:50.360
Ah...

15:50.532 --> 15:52.261
Right now, what I wanna know...

15:52.935 --> 15:55.426
...is if this jeopardizes my chances
at the internship.

15:55.604 --> 15:59.165
After all, it is traditionally granted
to the head of the Ivys.

15:59.341 --> 16:02.037
By professors that are no longer here.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.808
Yes, but your daddy...

16:04.980 --> 16:09.007
...is the head of the new board,
the whole program.

16:09.618 --> 16:12.485
And there might be some...

16:12.655 --> 16:15.089
...idle chitchat...

16:16.992 --> 16:23.488
...or discussion around the breakfast table
that might shed some insight.

16:23.666 --> 16:26.294
Maybe I can help out.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.062
Please.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.898
You know, I had it on the tip of my...

16:41.583 --> 16:43.813
Maybe I can jog your memory.

16:43.986 --> 16:46.113
I'm sure you can.

16:53.529 --> 16:55.588
Still foggy.

16:55.931 --> 16:57.330
Oh...

16:58.167 --> 17:02.001
I'm sorry, did you think
I was wearing panties?

17:02.504 --> 17:03.698
Are you?

17:06.742 --> 17:08.300
What you have...

17:08.743 --> 17:10.006
...better be what I want.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.007
That's funny. I was gonna say
the same thing.

17:14.183 --> 17:15.513
Bite it.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.488
Let's skip the cuddling.

19:04.693 --> 19:09.255
I don't know, Lea.
I'm still a little bit cloudy.

19:13.635 --> 19:15.432
Relax.

19:15.604 --> 19:20.974
One name is being mentioned
as far as the prized internship is concerned.

19:21.143 --> 19:22.235
And that is?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.776
Daisy.

19:24.479 --> 19:25.912
What?

19:27.282 --> 19:30.080
That hillbilly freshman? Are you joking?

19:30.252 --> 19:34.689
Dad seems smitten by her, and, I mean,
let's be real, what's not to like?

19:34.857 --> 19:37.417
- Ugh, you've got to be kidding.
- Ha, ha.

19:37.626 --> 19:39.992
Whatever you say, Lea,
but the girl is gold...

19:40.162 --> 19:44.292
...and unfortunately for you,
she's one of the few you don't own.

19:44.466 --> 19:45.899
Hmm.

19:46.668 --> 19:48.829
I'll own her like a pet.

19:49.004 --> 19:50.335
- A pet?
- Mm-hm.

19:50.505 --> 19:51.995
You looking for a new friend?

19:52.174 --> 19:55.701
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

19:55.878 --> 19:59.314
Oh, well, turning the farm girl
into an Ivy...

19:59.481 --> 20:02.075
...is not gonna stop her
from getting the internship.

20:02.251 --> 20:04.811
Yeah, we'll see about that.

20:05.053 --> 20:06.884
So tell me...

20:07.289 --> 20:09.553
...how can we fix those naughty grades
of mine?

20:09.725 --> 20:10.783
Oh, yeah.

20:11.426 --> 20:14.020
Well, I might have a friend...

20:14.196 --> 20:20.192
...who has a friend who's privy to
classified information, passwords and such.

20:20.569 --> 20:25.768
He might have the information you're
looking for, but there would be a price.

20:28.243 --> 20:30.177
We could make this a regular thing.

20:30.712 --> 20:34.705
Been there, done that,
bought the T-shirt.

20:35.117 --> 20:36.880
- I could bring a friend.
- Ah...

20:37.052 --> 20:39.418
Now we're talking.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.020
Isabel seems like a nice girl.

20:42.524 --> 20:45.516
Issy is a nice girl. I should know.

20:47.029 --> 20:49.520
Now, you hack into your mommy's
little computer...

20:49.698 --> 20:52.758
...and I'll make sure your little
perverted fantasies come true.

20:52.935 --> 20:54.334
Deal?

20:55.404 --> 20:56.598
See what I can do.

21:03.312 --> 21:04.779
Wow.

21:37.279 --> 21:40.373
We are gathered here
in the name of the sisterhood...

21:40.549 --> 21:44.986
...founded in the strength of her members,
preserved by their accomplishments.

21:56.131 --> 22:00.465
Each year, the sisterhood nominates
new women for membership.

22:00.635 --> 22:04.935
These names are not to be written down
anywhere nor spoken in public.

22:05.107 --> 22:07.598
There are two names up
for consideration.

22:07.776 --> 22:08.800
Three names.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.809
I hereby nominate...

22:15.183 --> 22:16.582
...Christa Caldwell...

22:16.752 --> 22:18.310
...Monique Price...

22:20.922 --> 22:23.083
...and Daisy Brooks.

22:38.974 --> 22:41.772
Good morning.
- Hey.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.345
Hey, what's this box?

22:54.289 --> 22:56.951
I don't know. It was delivered yesterday.

22:57.859 --> 23:02.353
Ugh. He is a real gift-giving fool. Heh.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.896
It's a cell phone.

23:24.252 --> 23:26.720
- What?
- That's not from Blake.

23:27.189 --> 23:30.681
- What do you mean? How do you know?
- Looks like you're being tapped by the Ivys.

23:30.859 --> 23:34.090
- Wait, the what?
- Technically, they don't exist.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.761
Technically, there's no sororities
or fraternities here anymore...

23:37.933 --> 23:40.026
...but the Ivys, they're a secret society.

23:40.202 --> 23:41.863
Why did they give this to me?

23:43.438 --> 23:47.738
Beats me. If the Ivys want you,
there's a good reason for it.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.110
- Do they want you?
- Heh.

23:50.879 --> 23:52.540
Trust me, they don't want me.

23:55.484 --> 23:56.849
I'll see you later.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.941
Um, I put the photocopies
on, uh, Dean Graves' desk.

24:22.110 --> 24:23.839
Great, thanks.

24:51.039 --> 24:52.131
I can't.

24:53.642 --> 24:55.269
Hello, Dean Graves' office.

24:56.845 --> 24:58.813
Yeah, we'll send someone right over.

24:58.980 --> 25:00.504
Daisy?

25:00.682 --> 25:02.343
Admissions just called.

25:02.517 --> 25:04.508
Can you go over
and pick up some files for us?

25:04.920 --> 25:07.252
Yeah, yeah, sure.

25:25.407 --> 25:27.170
Hi, Daisy.

25:27.709 --> 25:29.040
Is this from you?

25:29.678 --> 25:32.169
Keep it. I'm Azalea.
We're in Professor Graves' class.

25:32.981 --> 25:36.815
Right. Look, I'm just not really sure
what this is all about.

25:38.853 --> 25:40.320
It's not easy, is it?

25:40.989 --> 25:42.115
I'm sorry?

25:43.291 --> 25:44.622
Losing your parents.

25:48.196 --> 25:49.857
I lost my mother when I was 8...

25:50.031 --> 25:54.968
...and my dad's been on, like, a 10-year
business trip, so I know, it sucks.

25:57.839 --> 25:59.363
Yeah, it does.

25:59.541 --> 26:01.168
But it doesn't have to.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.902
We can help you, Daisy.

26:04.079 --> 26:07.139
We can help redefine family for you.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.876
Give you back that security blanket
that I know you miss.

26:13.955 --> 26:15.513
Let us help you.

26:17.459 --> 26:19.427
I do pretty well on my own.

26:20.695 --> 26:22.663
Sure you do, for now.

26:22.831 --> 26:27.666
I mean, you'll do well here and graduate,
even with honors, and then what?

26:27.836 --> 26:31.237
You'll be dead broke and owe thousands
in student bills...

26:31.406 --> 26:33.897
...and be stuck in some dead-end job
you're tied to...

26:34.075 --> 26:37.169
...because you can't afford to take a risk.

26:37.445 --> 26:39.845
A risk for something greater.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.480
That won't be me.

26:55.363 --> 26:57.991
The statistics say otherwise.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.100
We can change that.

27:04.606 --> 27:06.233
Think about it.

27:23.391 --> 27:26.121
Disrupt any good lectures today?

27:27.395 --> 27:29.693
Only with my brilliance.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.336
What, that's it? Come on, Dad...

27:37.706 --> 27:38.934
...don't stop the momentum now.

27:39.107 --> 27:40.938
That was an awesome
conversation starter.

27:45.213 --> 27:46.339
Well?

27:46.514 --> 27:50.416
It's official. Alexis Baldwin's death
has been ruled an accident.

27:50.585 --> 27:53.145
The investigation is being dropped.

27:53.321 --> 27:56.813
Maybe now we can all find some closure.

27:57.559 --> 27:58.890
Hopefully.

28:02.364 --> 28:05.629
Well, forgive me
if dealing with a student's death...

28:05.800 --> 28:09.463
...a grieving family and restoring
the reputation of this university...

28:09.637 --> 28:11.537
...has inconvenienced you in some way.

28:11.706 --> 28:15.642
Now, here's the old Graves family chats
we've come to know and love.

28:21.316 --> 28:23.147
Joining us for dinner?

28:23.318 --> 28:25.513
Actually, as appealing as that sounds...

28:27.188 --> 28:28.314
...I have a date...

28:28.757 --> 28:29.951
...with Daisy Brooks.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.301
So it was either a night out with you...

28:47.475 --> 28:50.911
...or another fantastic dinner
with my Norman Rockwell family.

28:53.114 --> 28:56.106
Must be nice to be around
your parents so much.

28:56.284 --> 29:00.653
Uh, if by "nice" you mean "suffocating,"
then, yeah, totally.

29:00.822 --> 29:05.054
Heh, I just don't know if anyone really
wants their parents around all the time.

29:07.896 --> 29:09.056
I'm sorry.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.255
I totally for...

29:12.534 --> 29:14.468
That was way inappropriate.

29:14.636 --> 29:19.164
That's okay. Your father says
you're persistently inappropriate.

29:20.308 --> 29:21.639
You speak to my father?

29:21.810 --> 29:23.539
Oh, yeah, we're real close.

29:25.313 --> 29:27.372
That makes one of us.

29:28.450 --> 29:30.247
So you two don't get along?

29:30.418 --> 29:32.113
That's an understatement.

29:32.287 --> 29:33.879
Can we not talk about my parents?

29:34.055 --> 29:35.579
- Sure.
- Thank you.

29:35.757 --> 29:38.920
How about we talk about you?

29:44.232 --> 29:46.564
Why do you like me, Blake?

29:48.870 --> 29:50.565
What do you mean?

29:50.839 --> 29:56.209
I mean, all the girls on campus,
and you're with me, the farm girl.

29:56.377 --> 30:00.370
That's probably exactly why I like you.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.175
You're different.

30:02.350 --> 30:03.874
Yeah?

30:06.955 --> 30:08.855
Trust me, it's refreshing.

30:09.023 --> 30:11.048
Refreshing?

30:11.226 --> 30:15.424
Heh. Lemonade is refreshing.
Iced tea is refreshing.

30:15.597 --> 30:17.497
I didn't mean it like that.

30:17.665 --> 30:19.826
Then how did you mean it?

30:21.135 --> 30:22.659
Well...

30:25.240 --> 30:28.801
...not only are you incredibly beautiful...

30:28.977 --> 30:30.968
...but you're also funny...

30:31.145 --> 30:33.079
...and smart...

30:33.448 --> 30:35.313
...and sweet.

30:35.483 --> 30:37.007
Go on.

34:24.112 --> 34:25.272
Good morning, Mother.

34:25.446 --> 34:26.879
You slept out last night.

34:27.815 --> 34:28.839
I did.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.942
Guess it's safe to assume
the date went well?

34:32.120 --> 34:34.850
Gotta tell you, she's one nice girl.

34:35.022 --> 34:36.989
Anything else?

34:39.927 --> 34:41.860
She's been tapped.

34:42.362 --> 34:43.489
By you or by them?

34:45.833 --> 34:47.664
Both, actually.

34:50.471 --> 34:52.701
You won't be seeing her anymore.

34:55.610 --> 34:57.510
What if I like her?

34:58.713 --> 35:01.045
Then like her from a distance.

35:23.171 --> 35:24.729
Blake?

35:35.750 --> 35:37.980
<i>You've reached the automated Blake.</i>

35:38.152 --> 35:40.347
<i>Leave a message and the real Blake</i>
<i>will get back to you.</i>

36:07.148 --> 36:11.244
<i>Hey, it's Nadia.</i>
<i>How soon can you come into the office?</i>

36:13.621 --> 36:14.952
What's going on?

36:16.324 --> 36:18.087
Daisy...

36:18.693 --> 36:21.127
...there's a problem
with your tuition installments.

36:21.529 --> 36:22.655
What?

36:22.830 --> 36:25.526
Apparently, your payments
have been defaulted.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.635
- But that's impossible.
- Don't worry, I'm sure it's a glitch.

36:28.803 --> 36:32.466
But you do have to figure this out
with the bank, otherwise...

36:32.640 --> 36:35.632
...well, the system
will automatically withdraw you...

36:35.810 --> 36:38.973
...from the college,
and you'll have to reapply next year.

36:39.146 --> 36:40.613
I'm sorry.

36:52.059 --> 36:53.083
You're so cute!

36:54.462 --> 36:56.862
<i>Hi, you've</i>
<i>reached the automated Blake.</i>

36:57.031 --> 36:58.259
Fantastic.

37:31.565 --> 37:33.260
What happened?

37:34.602 --> 37:36.365
My loan.

37:36.938 --> 37:39.668
I guess I didn't fill out the right forms
or something...

37:39.840 --> 37:42.308
...and they've frozen my account.

37:42.543 --> 37:46.240
Well, I'm sure it's just a mistake.
You'll get it all figured out.

37:46.414 --> 37:49.247
If I lose my loan,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

37:49.817 --> 37:51.717
I can't go home.

37:53.487 --> 37:55.387
It'll be okay.

37:55.723 --> 37:58.123
Why don't you come out
with me tonight?

38:00.561 --> 38:01.926
You sure?

38:27.455 --> 38:29.150
Basement?

38:34.595 --> 38:35.857
Hello?

38:37.765 --> 38:40.029
Is anybody down here?

38:55.016 --> 38:57.712
<i>Daisy.</i>

38:58.819 --> 39:01.788
<i>Daisy. Daisy. Daisy.</i>

39:01.956 --> 39:04.186
<i>Daisy. Daisy.</i>

39:07.995 --> 39:09.826
<i>Daisy.</i>

39:25.646 --> 39:26.806
Stand.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.785
We have gathered here today
for your initiation...

39:37.958 --> 39:40.324
...into the Sisterhood of the Ivys.

39:41.195 --> 39:46.690
Founded in the strength of its members,
preserved in their accomplishments.

39:46.867 --> 39:48.494
Repeat after me.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.873
Work together to accomplish more.

40:02.049 --> 40:04.244
These words may not mean much
to you now...

40:04.819 --> 40:06.650
...but believe me, to an Ivy...

40:07.455 --> 40:08.854
...they mean everything.

40:09.890 --> 40:13.018
No longer will you be alone in the world.

40:13.194 --> 40:18.860
From this room, we have spawned
senators, governors, CEOs.

40:19.467 --> 40:25.064
Thanks to each other, they have managed
to break down social barriers.

40:25.239 --> 40:27.901
All women, all Ivys.

40:28.609 --> 40:30.076
And you...

40:30.244 --> 40:35.307
You have been called upon
to continue this tradition.

40:36.617 --> 40:39.051
Do you accept this honor?

40:48.028 --> 40:49.928
So meek.

40:50.097 --> 40:53.123
Has the world got its grip
on you already? Answer.

40:53.634 --> 40:55.067
I accept.

40:55.236 --> 40:57.033
I accept.

41:01.909 --> 41:03.604
I accept.

41:08.415 --> 41:11.077
Kneel before your new sisters.

41:19.426 --> 41:22.554
All matters are dealt with
within these walls.

41:23.130 --> 41:26.896
Outside this room,
we are not even a rumor.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.967
We are a whisper.

41:29.136 --> 41:31.536
You will obey your older sisters.

41:31.705 --> 41:33.036
Do not question them.

41:33.207 --> 41:36.233
Trust is everything.

41:37.144 --> 41:39.738
And if you should feel pain...

41:40.047 --> 41:41.844
...we all bleed.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.610
And when you succeed...

41:46.787 --> 41:48.778
...we all succeed.

41:50.958 --> 41:52.858
And believe me...

41:53.027 --> 41:54.756
...you will succeed.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.598
"I solemnly swear...

42:10.077 --> 42:16.243
...to hold the bonds of the Ivy girls
higher than all others."

42:18.352 --> 42:21.150
The power of the Ivy is transcendent.

42:21.322 --> 42:24.120
Drink and join your new sisters.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.383
What is it?

42:26.894 --> 42:29.863
Trust in the solidarity of your sisters.

43:09.436 --> 43:11.495
Now, ladies.

43:15.376 --> 43:17.276
Table.

43:34.662 --> 43:38.063
Undress and lay face down.

44:11.999 --> 44:15.491
This bond unites us as women...

44:15.669 --> 44:17.933
...and binds us as sisters.

44:18.105 --> 44:19.129
Repeat.

44:19.306 --> 44:20.898
This bond...

44:21.075 --> 44:23.236
...unites us as women...

44:23.410 --> 44:27.005
...and binds us as sisters.

44:28.682 --> 44:30.980
Ivys are a family.

44:31.352 --> 44:33.912
We share everything.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.555
Our love...

44:35.723 --> 44:37.691
...our hate...

44:38.025 --> 44:39.822
...our pain.

44:41.161 --> 44:43.026
Everything.

45:33.147 --> 45:35.638
Welcome to the Ivys.

45:48.796 --> 45:51.526
Hurry, come on. We're late.

46:37.511 --> 46:39.570
They approved my loan?

46:44.885 --> 46:47.752
Now, once executive privilege is asserted...

46:47.921 --> 46:52.324
...the various branches of government
are set on a collision course...

46:52.493 --> 46:53.824
Miss Brooks.

46:53.994 --> 46:56.019
- towards destruction.

46:57.064 --> 47:01.000
Now, the judiciary is forced
into a difficult task...

47:01.168 --> 47:05.400
...of balancing the need for information
on a judicial proceeding...

47:05.572 --> 47:09.133
...and the executive's prerogative.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.705
Mr. Graves.

47:12.880 --> 47:16.441
- Girls, did you enjoy the class?
- Yeah, we did.

47:18.485 --> 47:21.283
Hey, how are you doing?
You were like a zombie this morning.

47:21.455 --> 47:23.082
Yeah, I just studied way too late.

47:23.257 --> 47:25.316
Well, did you get that whole loan thing
figured out?

47:25.492 --> 47:28.222
Mm-hm. Yeah.
Some weird clerical error. It's okay.

47:28.395 --> 47:30.693
- That's great. Did you wanna...?
- Nice hair, Magenta.

47:32.566 --> 47:33.692
Never mind.

47:34.434 --> 47:36.425
How you feeling this morning,
Little Miss Daisy?

47:36.603 --> 47:40.164
Not so good, but I'm gonna feel better
when I apologize to Professor Graves.

47:40.340 --> 47:44.140
You're not quite getting the whole Ivy
thing yet, are you?

47:44.311 --> 47:46.677
Daisy, we take care of our own.

47:46.847 --> 47:48.075
I'll handle it.

47:48.248 --> 47:50.079
Besides, look at yourself.

47:50.250 --> 47:51.979
Yeah, I just woke up late.

47:52.152 --> 47:55.144
Oh, sweetie, it's more than just that.

47:55.322 --> 47:58.849
You're an Ivy girl now.
You need to dress like it.

47:59.593 --> 48:00.890
Now, go wait in the hall.

48:07.334 --> 48:09.131
That was a great class, Andrew.

48:12.472 --> 48:15.100
Well, thank you, Miss Berges.

48:15.909 --> 48:17.240
You can call me Azalea.

48:17.411 --> 48:20.244
I have known you
since I was in middle school.

48:21.481 --> 48:23.210
I have two questions for you.

48:24.117 --> 48:26.381
- Okay.
- My first one is:

48:26.553 --> 48:31.991
Do you think that a young woman can be
sexually compatible with an older man?

48:32.693 --> 48:33.853
Excuse me?

48:34.461 --> 48:36.827
My human sexuality class
is having us do surveys...

48:36.997 --> 48:42.833
...on certain aspects of relationships,
and I need a few more unbiased subjects.

48:43.470 --> 48:45.995
I may not be the right person
to answer that question.

48:46.540 --> 48:48.405
Oh, you're perfect.

48:48.675 --> 48:52.236
Old enough for you to have seen it all,
yet still young enough where you can relate.

48:52.746 --> 48:54.509
I guess, uh...

48:54.681 --> 48:58.583
...on a case-by-case basis,
a relationship could work well.

48:58.986 --> 49:01.011
Everyone's different.

49:01.188 --> 49:04.715
And being that women do mature...

49:05.025 --> 49:07.516
...quicker than men, physiologically...

49:07.694 --> 49:10.754
...yes, a relationship
could work quite well.

49:11.164 --> 49:13.098
That makes a lot of sense.

49:13.266 --> 49:14.961
Stamina...

49:15.202 --> 49:16.931
...hormones.

49:17.170 --> 49:20.298
I bet they match up a lot nicer
at that stage.

49:21.274 --> 49:23.367
Now, my second question
to you would be:

49:23.543 --> 49:25.909
Is there anything extra that I can do...

49:26.079 --> 49:29.776
...in any way to help further
my chances with the internship?

49:29.950 --> 49:31.542
On a completely different note.

49:31.718 --> 49:33.618
Just keep your grades up.

49:33.787 --> 49:35.277
Do well on the exam.

49:35.756 --> 49:38.623
Of course, but you would tell me...

49:39.126 --> 49:41.321
...if there were anything...

49:41.495 --> 49:46.489
...extracurricular-wise I could do
or maybe put more...

49:46.900 --> 49:48.891
...effort into.

49:52.506 --> 49:53.939
Get back to you on that.

49:55.575 --> 49:57.566
You know where to find me.

50:09.156 --> 50:10.418
What's that for?

50:10.590 --> 50:11.648
Before.

50:12.626 --> 50:15.060
- Before what?
- "Before" picture...

50:15.228 --> 50:18.129
...soon to be followed
by an "after" picture.

50:18.298 --> 50:20.323
I don't follow.

50:21.101 --> 50:22.125
Of course you don't.

50:22.536 --> 50:24.060
Let's go.

52:11.378 --> 52:13.243
The blond's hot.

52:14.114 --> 52:15.979
Ugh, here comes trouble.

52:16.149 --> 52:17.548
There's Blake.

52:17.717 --> 52:19.014
Great, I'm out of here.

52:19.186 --> 52:20.676
Daisy.

52:23.757 --> 52:26.157
- Hey.
- Let go of me.

52:27.227 --> 52:30.094
Wow. You, uh, look different.

52:31.731 --> 52:33.790
No, in a good way.

52:35.035 --> 52:37.230
Would you please just look at me
for a second?

52:37.404 --> 52:39.065
Don't listen to his B.S.

52:39.239 --> 52:40.433
What's she saying?

52:40.607 --> 52:43.167
Whatever you think of me
right now, it's not the case.

52:43.343 --> 52:46.642
Really, so you didn't just sleep with me
and then completely ignore me?

52:46.813 --> 52:50.271
You blew me off, Blake.
I saw you with that other girl.

52:51.852 --> 52:53.479
Are you kidding me? She was nobody.

52:53.653 --> 52:56.087
- She was a friend. Look...
- Don't let him get to you.

52:58.692 --> 52:59.989
Daisy, I like you.

53:00.393 --> 53:03.988
Things are complicated, but if you give me
a chance to explain myself...

53:04.164 --> 53:06.758
You had a chance to explain,
two days ago.

53:06.933 --> 53:09.265
You blew it, Blake. Goodbye.

53:09.970 --> 53:13.269
Good girl, Daisy.
- Daisy.

53:30.590 --> 53:32.990
Wow, I need your financial-aid program.

53:33.159 --> 53:34.717
Nice, huh? Heh.

53:34.895 --> 53:37.762
You've assimilated.

53:37.931 --> 53:40.399
Let's just say I found my fashion sense.

53:40.567 --> 53:42.091
And lost your common sense.

53:42.269 --> 53:44.533
No, I haven't.

53:46.740 --> 53:49.538
So is being an Ivy
living up to all its hype?

53:50.510 --> 53:54.139
- Hype?
- Well, I mean, it's a lifelong commitment.

53:54.314 --> 53:58.080
Well, I don't know.
I think I just needed to let go.

53:58.485 --> 54:00.976
There's letting go
and then there's being an idiot.

54:01.154 --> 54:03.019
Have I given you a hard time
about your look?

54:03.189 --> 54:05.384
My look I do for me,
not for somebody else.

54:05.558 --> 54:08.322
I think I like
the tarantula-carrying country girl better.

54:08.495 --> 54:10.429
It's just clothes, Magenta.

54:11.031 --> 54:12.498
Don't fool yourself.

54:12.666 --> 54:16.261
Those girls want something from you,
and it's not your money, that's for sure.

54:16.436 --> 54:18.666
Oh, so they can't like me for who I am?

54:18.838 --> 54:21.238
No, Daisy, that's the point. They can't.

54:25.679 --> 54:28.273
Why don't you go ask your friends
about Alexis Baldwin?

54:30.750 --> 54:33.082
What about Alexis Baldwin?

54:33.920 --> 54:37.048
Isn't she the girl that died last semester?

54:39.626 --> 54:42.959
She was my last roommate.

54:43.930 --> 54:45.898
They tapped her...

54:46.232 --> 54:48.200
...and now she's dead.

54:49.803 --> 54:53.204
Wait, but that was just an accident.
Everybody knows that.

54:54.307 --> 54:56.571
Yeah, everybody but me.

54:57.077 --> 55:00.069
Well, here comes the conspiracy theory.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.175
You know what, forget it.

55:03.350 --> 55:05.784
Oh, and some guy named Will called.

55:07.821 --> 55:09.550
He sounded nice.

55:12.392 --> 55:13.552
<i>Hello.</i>

55:13.727 --> 55:16.287
<i>Hey, it's me. I got your message.</i>

55:16.463 --> 55:18.294
<i>I really miss you guys.</i>

55:18.732 --> 55:21.565
It's so big here, it makes me
realize how small home is.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.431
Perspective does amazing things.

55:24.771 --> 55:26.762
<i>It's so different.</i>

55:26.940 --> 55:30.034
<i>I'm just starting to make some friends.</i>

55:31.111 --> 55:33.011
That's great, Daisy...

55:33.179 --> 55:34.646
...really.

55:35.148 --> 55:38.640
So maybe we'll be lucky enough out here
to get a visit over the next summer.

55:39.452 --> 55:43.081
- Yeah, how's your home coming along?
- <i>It's coming along great.</i>

55:43.256 --> 55:46.054
I should probably have
the foundation of our...

55:46.726 --> 55:50.093
Of the, uh, ahem, place done by then.

55:55.535 --> 55:57.628
I miss you, Daisy.

55:59.472 --> 56:01.406
I miss you too.

56:16.222 --> 56:17.621
Look at you.

56:17.791 --> 56:20.282
Heh. What?

56:23.363 --> 56:25.558
Daisy, I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

56:29.669 --> 56:30.727
Is something wrong?

56:31.171 --> 56:32.798
It's about your scholarship.

56:33.273 --> 56:37.437
Your application was reviewed,
and, well, they awarded you one, in full.

56:37.610 --> 56:39.100
Congratulations, you deserve it.

56:41.047 --> 56:43.641
It must be a relief
not to have to work here anymore.

56:43.817 --> 56:46.285
Wow, I mean, I don't even know
what to say.

56:46.453 --> 56:49.684
This is incredible,
but I would still like to work here.

56:49.856 --> 56:52.654
I'm not the type to quit
in the middle of something.

56:52.826 --> 56:54.987
Well, we would love to keep you on.

56:55.395 --> 56:58.023
You've been a valuable asset to us.

57:01.601 --> 57:04.297
You replaced the dean mid-semester
last year, right?

57:04.471 --> 57:05.699
Yes.

57:05.872 --> 57:08.500
Was that because of the death
on campus?

57:08.675 --> 57:12.736
Yes, that had something to do with it,
but not everything.

57:12.912 --> 57:14.903
Why do you ask?

57:15.415 --> 57:19.078
Well, I'm rooming
with her old roommate, Magenta Hart.

57:19.919 --> 57:21.853
It was an accident, right?

57:25.992 --> 57:30.554
I've heard all the rumors too, but, no,
in the end it was a terrible accident.

57:32.532 --> 57:35.160
Unless, of course,
you've heard to the contrary.

57:35.335 --> 57:37.030
No.

57:39.205 --> 57:41.230
Congratulations again, Daisy.

57:42.775 --> 57:44.470
Thank you.

58:04.664 --> 58:06.063
Ladies.

58:06.232 --> 58:07.824
Come to honor our agreement?

58:08.001 --> 58:10.231
Only if you've honored yours.

58:10.403 --> 58:12.371
You're serious.

58:12.772 --> 58:14.569
And you weren't?
- Heh.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.108
Lea told me all about it.

58:18.278 --> 58:20.109
I'm totally into it.

58:20.680 --> 58:23.979
Well, then I think we should find
a place a little more comfortable.

58:25.552 --> 58:29.488
The minute my grades are changed,
we're all yours.

58:29.656 --> 58:31.146
So, what's the holdup?

58:31.324 --> 58:34.885
The passwords change every week.
I don't know what time they change, so...

58:35.061 --> 58:36.722
Is little Blakey scared?

58:38.398 --> 58:41.993
It's big Blakey, remember?

58:42.168 --> 58:46.628
And you rocket scientists
are confusing smart and cautious for scared.

58:46.806 --> 58:48.501
Smart and cautious or just stalling?

58:51.444 --> 58:53.036
Not stalling.

58:53.546 --> 58:56.071
So then you have the passwords?

58:56.249 --> 58:58.183
I might have this week's password.

58:58.651 --> 59:00.881
Where might that be?

59:01.054 --> 59:05.115
It might be in my pocket.

59:07.060 --> 59:08.493
Ooh.

59:10.496 --> 59:11.827
Nothing there, Blakey.

59:11.998 --> 59:13.329
Oh, there's something there.

59:13.499 --> 59:15.228
Check the other.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.327
If you're messing with me...

59:19.772 --> 59:21.000
I mean it.

59:29.549 --> 59:31.176
Let's go, Issy.

59:33.219 --> 59:35.210
You're reneging on our agreement.

59:36.022 --> 59:37.546
No.

59:47.700 --> 59:49.565
Just making sure everything's
on the up and up.

59:50.336 --> 59:51.997
Oh, it will be.

59:52.305 --> 59:53.966
And, uh...

59:54.140 --> 59:58.406
...even if you do manage to get your grades
changed, there's still Daisy.

59:59.078 --> 01:00:01.569
Daisy's an Ivy, just like I said she'd be.

01:00:01.748 --> 01:00:03.943
Well, just because the empress
has some new clothes...

01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:06.278
...doesn't mean she's gonna fall
on her sword.

01:00:06.452 --> 01:00:09.216
She'll fall, they all do.
I can make her do whatever I want.

01:00:09.389 --> 01:00:10.913
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

01:00:11.324 --> 01:00:15.852
And you just better make sure those
passwords are right, and I won't have to.

01:00:20.633 --> 01:00:22.225
Bye.

01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:37.641
It's nice to have Blakey
wrapped around your finger.

01:00:37.817 --> 01:00:39.717
Isn't it though?

01:00:40.787 --> 01:00:42.982
And...

01:00:44.457 --> 01:00:46.925
Sure beats studying.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.927
Oh, no, he didn't.

01:01:01.107 --> 01:01:03.166
What a liar.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.045
That really pisses me off.

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:10.541
It's time for plan B.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:16.518
I think that's why Blake
has to sleep with every girl he sees.

01:01:16.689 --> 01:01:20.216
He's making up for the fact that his father
can't even get with his own mother.

01:01:20.393 --> 01:01:21.587
Pathetic.

01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:24.792
Sorry, Daisy, we didn't mean...

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.695
No, it's okay. I'm so over it.

01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:41.913
What's going on?

01:02:03.236 --> 01:02:04.828
Daisy.

01:02:19.752 --> 01:02:22.619
Daisy, wait.

01:02:25.091 --> 01:02:26.854
I'm sorry you had to see that.

01:02:27.493 --> 01:02:29.017
I can't believe he taped us.

01:02:29.695 --> 01:02:31.219
He's a man.

01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:33.331
How could he stoop so low?

01:02:34.267 --> 01:02:39.500
He taped you, Daisy.
You have to hit him back, hard.

01:02:39.772 --> 01:02:41.296
No, just... Just drop it.

01:02:41.474 --> 01:02:43.635
I don't wanna make the situation worse.

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:46.335
If someone throws eggs at your house...

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.275
...you burn theirs down.

01:02:50.483 --> 01:02:51.950
Now, are you truly...

01:02:52.985 --> 01:02:54.748
...ready to become an Ivy?

01:03:13.139 --> 01:03:15.471
Yeah, so make sure you do it.
Here we go.

01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:17.575
Four minutes? Let's go.

01:03:23.983 --> 01:03:25.507
It's clear.

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:32.885
This is your thing. Do it.

01:03:36.796 --> 01:03:38.161
I can't.

01:03:38.331 --> 01:03:39.423
There is no can't.

01:03:40.299 --> 01:03:42.233
Did he hesitate
when he took advantage of you?

01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:45.760
Blake doesn't deserve this.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.336
Wrong answer.

01:03:51.844 --> 01:03:53.778
I'm out of here.

01:04:21.173 --> 01:04:23.937
We'll be taking a closer look
at governmental policy...

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:29.104
...which maintains a separation of power
through checks and balances.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:37.013
- Not a good show last night, Miss Daisy.
- What you did was wrong.

01:04:37.189 --> 01:04:40.488
- What he did was worse.
- But he did it to me.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:42.059
That's where you're wrong.

01:04:42.228 --> 01:04:44.389
You belong to a family now.
I thought you knew that.

01:04:45.164 --> 01:04:46.927
Well, maybe I didn't quite understand.

01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:48.999
Well, now you do.

01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:53.334
Don't you? This is for life.

01:04:53.506 --> 01:04:54.905
You better get used to that.

01:04:55.274 --> 01:04:56.741
Sorry.

01:04:58.277 --> 01:04:59.835
We forgive you, Daisy.

01:05:00.012 --> 01:05:03.743
You're young, and you don't quite
understand how it all works yet.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:05.174
But...

01:05:05.351 --> 01:05:08.320
...if you ever cross your sisters again...

01:05:08.754 --> 01:05:12.850
...it will be, oh, so ugly if you do.

01:05:16.429 --> 01:05:18.693
Everyone get your questions together.

01:05:18.864 --> 01:05:20.991
Your opening statements.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.358
That's enough for today.

01:05:25.304 --> 01:05:29.764
Try to read through to chapter 27
before the next class, and thank you.

01:05:35.281 --> 01:05:36.407
Ms. Brooks.

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.440
Can I speak to you for a moment?

01:05:42.722 --> 01:05:45.555
Everything okay?
Usually a point of mine doesn't go by...

01:05:45.725 --> 01:05:47.920
...without you coming up
with some new question.

01:05:48.094 --> 01:05:50.562
Yeah, yeah, I'm just cramming
for another class.

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:52.789
The majority of the essays
have been turned in.

01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:55.593
I heard,
and I'm just finishing mine up.

01:05:55.768 --> 01:05:58.259
There's two weeks left before the exam.

01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:00.936
Let's pull it together.

01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:14.779
- You gave my car a nice paint job.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:14.954 --> 01:06:16.421
I get it. Azalea put you up to it.

01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:19.786
Yeah, just like that video
you leaked on the Internet.

01:06:19.959 --> 01:06:22.894
There's no use explaining
that I had nothing to do with that.

01:06:23.429 --> 01:06:25.590
And I had nothing to do with your car.

01:06:25.765 --> 01:06:26.993
Now we're even.

01:06:27.166 --> 01:06:28.224
Bye, Blake.

01:06:34.974 --> 01:06:37.465
Hey.
- That's that Internet girl.

01:06:37.643 --> 01:06:39.008
The girl from that...

01:06:39.178 --> 01:06:42.409
Oh, yeah, ride me, baby, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:44.549
She's, like, strutting her thing. I swear.

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:04.027
That was a 10.

01:07:04.203 --> 01:07:06.034
We need to talk.

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:07.463
Yes, drama.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:10.131
My father had dinner
with Senator Mitchell last night.

01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:12.777
They got to talking
about the internship...

01:07:13.345 --> 01:07:16.007
...and it seems somebody's
already been chosen.

01:07:17.149 --> 01:07:19.515
And it's not Daisy.

01:07:20.219 --> 01:07:21.811
Well, who is it?

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:24.753
It's not you, Azalea.

01:07:24.924 --> 01:07:26.858
It's Magenta Hart.

01:07:28.594 --> 01:07:31.188
What? That rainbow-haired corpse?

01:07:31.363 --> 01:07:33.490
I know, Blake flat-out lied to us.

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:36.226
He lied about the passwords
and about the internship.

01:07:36.402 --> 01:07:39.735
Maybe he's been playing games
with you all along.

01:07:39.905 --> 01:07:40.997
Really?

01:07:41.173 --> 01:07:43.471
The Graves have declared war
on the Ivys.

01:07:44.076 --> 01:07:47.568
If it's war they want, I'll give it to them.

01:08:07.233 --> 01:08:10.669
Have the police questioned you
about Blake's car?

01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:12.064
No.

01:08:12.238 --> 01:08:15.264
Good. Honestly, I'm relieved.

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.437
Look...

01:08:18.611 --> 01:08:20.203
...Daisy...

01:08:21.212 --> 01:08:26.651
...in life, you'd hope that people
do the right thing, and rarely...

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:27.877
...that's the case.

01:08:30.089 --> 01:08:35.185
But you're being used by people
that are trying to take us away from you.

01:08:35.928 --> 01:08:37.452
Do you wanna be an Ivy?

01:08:38.798 --> 01:08:41.631
Well, you said it was for life.
What choice do I have?

01:08:42.334 --> 01:08:44.096
There's always a choice.

01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:46.602
You just have to be able to deal
with the repercussions.

01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:49.303
Is that a threat?

01:08:51.143 --> 01:08:52.906
Sweetheart...

01:08:53.078 --> 01:08:56.536
...who do you think made
your financial-aid problems go away?

01:08:57.783 --> 01:09:00.081
Who do you think gave
you your scholarship?

01:09:01.687 --> 01:09:03.211
And it doesn't end there.

01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:07.617
What about your little Will back home?

01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:10.321
Are you ready for that?

01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.122
Ready to take the innocent down
with you?

01:09:13.299 --> 01:09:15.163
How do you know about Will?

01:09:17.203 --> 01:09:19.296
It's called leverage, Daisy.

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:21.439
I have stashed away
this piece of paper...

01:09:21.607 --> 01:09:24.508
...and at the top it says "Land Deed,"
at the bottom, a name...

01:09:24.676 --> 01:09:26.667
...and it's "William Miller."

01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:28.404
What did you do with Will's land?

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:32.017
If you can walk away with this
and see it as a learning experience...

01:09:32.184 --> 01:09:34.880
...I think we have a future together.

01:09:35.354 --> 01:09:38.790
Who do you think you're messing with?

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:41.624
You think we don't cover all our bases?

01:09:42.361 --> 01:09:44.420
Now, I'm gonna ask you one last time...

01:09:45.197 --> 01:09:47.256
...because I'm nice:

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.430
Are you an Ivy?

01:09:52.136 --> 01:09:53.263
Yes.

01:09:55.574 --> 01:09:57.064
Good.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.840
Now you're gonna have to prove it.

01:10:00.913 --> 01:10:02.540
What do you want me to do?

01:10:10.723 --> 01:10:12.782
I'm in the courtyard.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.260
<i>The main door should be open.</i>

01:10:15.427 --> 01:10:17.622
- <i>Go through it.</i>
- But that's the administration building.

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:19.730
You said I was going through the dorms.

01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:22.834
<i>I did. Change of plans.</i>

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:34.011
Okay, I'm in the hall,
and I'm kind of freaked out right now.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:38.413
Okay, down the hall
there's a janitor's closet. Go in it.

01:10:49.728 --> 01:10:51.889
Okay, I'm going in.

01:10:52.398 --> 01:10:54.628
<i>Now, take your jacket off.</i>

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.926
What?

01:10:56.101 --> 01:10:57.864
<i>Put it in the closet.</i>

01:10:58.037 --> 01:11:00.028
<i>Leave it here?</i>

01:11:00.205 --> 01:11:02.833
You didn't think you were gonna get
all dolled up for nothing?

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:04.942
<i>What does this have to do</i>
<i>with anything?</i>

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:07.704
Trust is everything.

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:09.874
Now, lose it.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:28.099
Okay, now what?

01:11:28.634 --> 01:11:33.401
Now go back in the hall
and up the stairs, one floor.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:55.489
Where am I going, Azalea?

01:11:55.861 --> 01:11:57.226
First door on the right.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:11:59.625
But what's up here?

01:11:59.798 --> 01:12:02.392
Don't ask, just do.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.562
Professor Graves' office?

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.105
Exactly.

01:12:09.274 --> 01:12:11.105
Now, quietly open the door.

01:12:12.478 --> 01:12:14.036
But he's in there.

01:12:16.382 --> 01:12:17.906
We know.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.914
Kicked out again by the missis.

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:22.076
Probably getting off
on some Internet porn.

01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:24.518
You will be a refreshing sight.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:27.053
Come on, what am I doing here?

01:12:27.226 --> 01:12:30.855
Daisy, you're going to go in
and make the poor man feel better.

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:32.827
<i>You're going to have sex with him.</i>

01:12:32.998 --> 01:12:36.627
- What?
- <i>You go in there and do this.</i>

01:12:36.802 --> 01:12:38.269
This isn't gonna help anything.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.632
<i>Will's land is at stake here.</i>

01:12:40.806 --> 01:12:43.001
Think about what you're saying.

01:12:43.475 --> 01:12:46.273
Are you turning your back
on your sisters again?

01:12:55.554 --> 01:12:57.545
Daisy has left the building.

01:12:57.723 --> 01:12:59.054
It's too predictable.

01:12:59.658 --> 01:13:02.786
Do I have to do everything
around here myself?

01:13:20.379 --> 01:13:21.471
What are you doing here?

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.206
Couldn't sleep.

01:13:25.217 --> 01:13:27.014
So you came over here?

01:13:51.577 --> 01:13:53.602
Highly inappropriate.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.771
Go home, Azalea.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.914
Inappropriate is you here alone at night.

01:14:01.386 --> 01:14:03.820
Well, that's my business, isn't it?

01:14:11.396 --> 01:14:12.920
Oops.

01:14:13.765 --> 01:14:16.233
- Give me the keys.
- No.

01:14:17.069 --> 01:14:19.503
- Give me the keys.
- No.

01:14:22.474 --> 01:14:24.032
You deserve...

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:26.643
...so much more.

01:14:29.448 --> 01:14:32.212
You have no idea what I deserve.

01:14:33.485 --> 01:14:35.043
Really?

01:14:36.021 --> 01:14:37.818
Is it complicated?

01:14:38.257 --> 01:14:40.316
You're crossing way over the line here.

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.557
And I think you...

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:46.129
I think you assumed a little too much.

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:51.399
But you're miserable.

01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:55.601
I can see it every day in class.

01:14:56.008 --> 01:14:57.669
You are overworked...

01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:00.110
...and unloved.

01:15:00.445 --> 01:15:02.572
Heh, Andrew...

01:15:03.315 --> 01:15:07.115
...I was born into neglect.
I can't imagine marrying it.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:12.480
I need to be free, to feel.

01:15:13.725 --> 01:15:15.522
Don't you miss that?

01:15:18.797 --> 01:15:20.662
Don't you want that?

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.120
No!

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:51.357
- I can't do it. I'm sorry too.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:52.264 --> 01:15:55.665
I'm just... I'm surrounded by people
all the time, and I'm alone.

01:15:58.136 --> 01:15:59.797
I thought you might understand.

01:16:00.872 --> 01:16:03.340
I'm sorry. Here.

01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:22.705
Your son was better.

01:18:33.592 --> 01:18:34.752
What's happening?

01:18:34.926 --> 01:18:36.518
I think a professor was killed.

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:38.785
What?

01:18:39.197 --> 01:18:40.357
Who?

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:42.630
Professor Graves.

01:18:56.948 --> 01:18:58.973
Miss Danielle Brooks?
- Yes.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.709
Detective Morgan Hadrian.

01:19:00.886 --> 01:19:03.787
I'm investigating the murder
of Professor Graves.

01:19:03.955 --> 01:19:06.014
Can we speak in private?

01:19:14.399 --> 01:19:17.391
Is it true you had a relationship
with Professor Graves' son?

01:19:17.569 --> 01:19:19.503
We went out once, yes.

01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:20.763
Nothing more?

01:19:20.939 --> 01:19:24.602
If you mean, is there a video on the Internet
showing me having sex with Blake?

01:19:24.776 --> 01:19:26.004
Yes, there is.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.372
And the relationship?

01:19:27.546 --> 01:19:29.912
It's over, it's been over.

01:19:30.081 --> 01:19:32.515
- You seem upset about that.
- The video, yes.

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:34.015
The relationship, no.

01:19:34.486 --> 01:19:37.751
So there'd be no reason
to torch the car, right?

01:19:37.923 --> 01:19:39.857
I mean, no reason to kill his dad.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.856
I didn't do any of those things.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.454
You worked for Elisabeth Graves
as well, correct?

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:47.359
- Yes.
- You see...

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:50.228
...you seem to have a lot of access
to the Graves.

01:19:50.402 --> 01:19:51.664
Andrew's class...

01:19:51.837 --> 01:19:54.431
...you worked for Elisabeth,
dated the son...

01:19:57.075 --> 01:20:01.034
Well, we are gonna be going over
that building with a fine-tooth comb.

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.875
Fingerprints results should be back
in about a day or so.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:08.145
But until then,
please don't leave campus.

01:20:15.794 --> 01:20:17.762
<i>as information becomes available.</i>

01:20:17.929 --> 01:20:22.389
<i>Again Professor Andrew Graves,</i>
<i>husband of Dean Elisabeth Graves...</i>

01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:25.502
<i>... was found murdered in his office</i>
<i>early this morning.</i>

01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:27.297
Can you believe this?

01:20:27.939 --> 01:20:28.963
No.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:33.008
<i>We'll continue to bring you</i>
<i>all the latest on this developing story</i> as...

01:20:33.178 --> 01:20:35.703
Know anything about it?

01:20:37.415 --> 01:20:39.144
Why would I?

01:20:39.317 --> 01:20:41.911
Because this has the mark of the Ivys.

01:20:43.121 --> 01:20:45.055
Wake up, Daisy.

01:20:45.323 --> 01:20:47.587
You're sleeping with wolves.

01:21:01.206 --> 01:21:02.730
My little Daisy.

01:21:02.908 --> 01:21:05.103
I'm so glad you called.

01:21:06.144 --> 01:21:08.476
You went to see him after I left...

01:21:08.647 --> 01:21:10.308
...didn't you?

01:21:11.016 --> 01:21:12.950
You were scared...

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:16.281
...and you let your sisters down.
It's upsetting.

01:21:17.222 --> 01:21:18.712
You...

01:21:19.824 --> 01:21:21.189
You killed him.

01:21:21.359 --> 01:21:22.621
<i>Not me.</i>

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.957
Your dainty little fingerprints
are all over that place.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.832
I can't believe you did this.

01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:33.637
You're such a sweet thing.

01:21:34.072 --> 01:21:37.974
There's something almost envious
about you.

01:21:39.911 --> 01:21:41.208
<i>Almost.</i>

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:25.850
Blake...

01:22:31.329 --> 01:22:34.059
- Wasn't you, was it?
- No.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.168
Blake, I know.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.428
I am so sorry.

01:22:40.572 --> 01:22:43.040
I just want it all back.

01:22:44.743 --> 01:22:47.303
- We need to do something. Call the police.
- No, we can't.

01:22:47.479 --> 01:22:49.242
We can't just take this to the police.

01:22:49.414 --> 01:22:50.574
Why?

01:22:50.749 --> 01:22:53.650
- This has been going on for way too long.
- Listen to me.

01:22:53.818 --> 01:22:55.979
If you do, my mother
will be forced to deny it.

01:22:56.154 --> 01:22:57.416
She'll cover the whole thing up.

01:22:58.023 --> 01:23:00.890
The dean of students is gonna cover...?

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:07.827
Oh, my God. She's an Ivy, isn't she?

01:23:20.378 --> 01:23:23.040
Daisy, you're not here by accident.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:27.009
You were handpicked
to clean up the Ivys.

01:23:29.354 --> 01:23:32.289
Listen to me.
You have no idea how big this is.

01:23:32.457 --> 01:23:35.654
You can't out a billion-dollar secret
organization with a phone call.

01:23:35.827 --> 01:23:38.762
They'll do anything they can to cover it up.
Blood will be shed.

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:40.522
Blood has been shed.

01:23:42.834 --> 01:23:44.631
More blood.

01:23:45.603 --> 01:23:48.094
I can't believe you used me.

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:49.501
All of you.

01:23:51.309 --> 01:23:53.334
Even your mom.

01:23:53.511 --> 01:23:55.035
Yeah...

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.453
God, I am so naive.

01:24:08.927 --> 01:24:10.519
Daisy...

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:16.623
...you can't stop them.

01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:19.534
I've learned one thing from the Ivys.

01:24:19.704 --> 01:24:23.435
If someone eggs your house,
burn theirs down.

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:44.624
I'm scared.

01:24:46.197 --> 01:24:48.597
Come here, little Daisy.

01:24:53.371 --> 01:24:55.635
I'm so sorry.

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:59.174
I should never have betrayed you.

01:25:00.145 --> 01:25:02.306
My sisters...

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:05.574
...the Ivys, they're all I have left.

01:25:10.155 --> 01:25:12.953
Alexis was like you, Daisy.

01:25:13.391 --> 01:25:15.689
But she made the wrong choice.

01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.886
She turned her back on her sisters.

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:22.390
And we had to take care of her.

01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:28.031
But we did things our way.

01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:31.698
It was an accident, and that's exactly
what Professor Graves will be.

01:25:31.876 --> 01:25:34.538
Just another terrible...

01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:36.809
...accident.

01:25:38.449 --> 01:25:41.213
They can't hurt us, Daisy.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.214
When you're an Ivy...

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:45.788
...you can get away with murder.

01:25:46.357 --> 01:25:47.585
Trust me.

01:25:51.596 --> 01:25:52.927
I did.

01:25:55.667 --> 01:25:57.328
And you betrayed me.

01:25:57.502 --> 01:26:01.438
And now consider the favor paid in full.

01:26:02.974 --> 01:26:04.532
What are you doing?

01:26:06.077 --> 01:26:08.875
I'm keeping my enemy close.

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.640
Very close.

01:26:13.384 --> 01:26:14.442
You bitch!

01:27:03.868 --> 01:27:07.235
Azalea, stop it! You've gone too far.

01:27:32.163 --> 01:27:35.428
You guys gotta help.
It's Azalea, she's gone crazy.

01:28:18.443 --> 01:28:19.910
I've got a pulse.

01:28:23.181 --> 01:28:25.115
<i>When you're an Ivy...</i>

01:28:25.283 --> 01:28:27.683
<i>... you can get away with murder.</i>

01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:02.419
Couldn't you have come up
with a tougher name?

01:29:03.654 --> 01:29:06.145
Usually they call it something
like Horseshoe Ranch...

01:29:06.324 --> 01:29:09.885
...or Rusty Nail Ranch, but Daisy Ranch?

01:29:10.061 --> 01:29:11.619
Guys might laugh, Will.

01:29:12.463 --> 01:29:14.693
Heh, yeah, they already did.

01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:18.635
Leave it up to me
to give it a man's touch, huh?

01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:21.037
What are you doing here, Daisy?

01:29:21.873 --> 01:29:25.775
Some stuff happened at school, and I
kind of got the rest of the semester off.

01:29:25.943 --> 01:29:27.774
You're okay. Everything's fine, right?

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:31.403
Yeah, yeah, I got straight A's
on my last semester...

01:29:31.582 --> 01:29:33.550
...and a full scholarship
for the next four years.

01:29:33.718 --> 01:29:35.151
Wow, heh.

01:29:35.319 --> 01:29:38.618
That sounds great. It sounds like
you got everything figured out.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.055
Everything except...

01:29:42.293 --> 01:29:43.726
...you.

01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:49.460
What do you mean?

01:29:50.768 --> 01:29:52.861
You know what I mean, Will.

01:29:55.106 --> 01:29:56.903
So, uh, you're here for...?

01:29:57.075 --> 01:29:58.770
For the summer, at least.

01:29:58.943 --> 01:30:00.570
And then you go back.

01:30:01.312 --> 01:30:03.576
For the next four years.

01:30:04.115 --> 01:30:05.605
And then?

01:30:17.929 --> 01:30:20.557
Well, I guess we have to figure it out
as we go...

01:30:20.731 --> 01:30:22.392
...together.

01:30:33.044 --> 01:30:35.512
Hey, you got a tattoo.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.942
Yeah, do you like it?

01:30:37.815 --> 01:30:39.908
Yeah, it's a great-looking daisy.

01:35:03.714 --> 01:35:05.705
