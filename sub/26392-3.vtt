09:42.973 --> 09:44.409
Claire, I am 20
pounds heavier

09:44.453 --> 09:46.368
than I was in college.

09:46.411 --> 09:49.023
If we don't make serious
changes, I may never dunk again,

09:49.066 --> 09:51.852
and you might never
fit in your old jeans.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.594
What? I can fit in my old jeans.

09:54.637 --> 09:55.638
Eh, sure you can.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.075
[scoffs]

09:58.119 --> 10:00.687
Ooh.You'll probably die

10:00.730 --> 10:02.384
right after me.
[laughs]

10:02.427 --> 10:04.952
Which would be
super sweet.

10:04.995 --> 10:06.780
Our last words
will probably be,

10:06.823 --> 10:09.521
"Are you gonna finish that?"

10:12.481 --> 10:14.135
[thumping]Baby?

10:14.178 --> 10:16.311
Babe, you okay in there?[grunting]

10:16.354 --> 10:18.443
Sounds like you're
flipping a tire.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
Ba-bam!

10:21.272 --> 10:23.187
Oh.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.580
You see?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.190
Yeah, those are nice.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.714
Now, uh, turn around.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.543
I really don't want to.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.197
Button popped off, didn't it?

10:33.241 --> 10:35.722
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a sewing kit, um...

10:35.765 --> 10:38.072
and a drywall patch.Oh.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.296
I am so glad you guys
asked for my help.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.950
As my trainer Antoine says,
the first step

10:46.994 --> 10:48.299
to getting in shape
is getting rid

10:48.343 --> 10:49.561
of all the junk food.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.955
Or, in your case,
just food.

10:55.002 --> 10:58.614
Uh, only thing left in there is,
uh, some milk,

10:58.658 --> 11:00.790
a box of baking soda

11:00.834 --> 11:02.879
and the tops
of some strawberries.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.186
Ah...Yeah.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.230
I had to cut them
because the bottoms

11:06.274 --> 11:07.449
were all dipped
in chocolate.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.628
Now, let's
do your pantry.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.456
Toss all of this

11:14.499 --> 11:16.371
in these boxes, and
I will throw it away.

11:16.414 --> 11:19.069
Antoine says junk food
can be as addictive as heroin.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.028
[snorts] Yeah, right.Okay, that's a little dramatic.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.725
Give me those back,
you son of a bitch!

11:26.947 --> 11:29.601
Uh...[thudding]

11:29.645 --> 11:32.561
I get it. You know, back when I
was Fat Cooper, I threw a tizzy

11:32.604 --> 11:35.303
when my parents pollywogged
my Tim Tams in the bin.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.655
I don't know
what you just said, uh...

11:39.699 --> 11:42.266
But I did think
of a new Fat Cooper name.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.659
Meal Gibson.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.661
[laughs]

11:45.705 --> 11:48.490
Or Olivia Fig Newton-John.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.753
[both laugh]

11:50.797 --> 11:52.581
Ha, ha. Ha.
Great bullying, guys.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.495
Now get to work.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.716
All right.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.500
Well, Cap'n Crunch,

11:58.543 --> 12:00.197
looks like it's Chips Ahoy.

12:02.330 --> 12:05.507
[humming "Taps"]Silly rabbit, looks like

12:05.550 --> 12:07.727
Trix are for nobody now.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.080
Twizzlers.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.908
Now, who's ready for breakfast?

12:14.951 --> 12:15.778
Oh, I am.Me!

12:17.345 --> 12:19.390
Hey. There...Oh.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.743
Jake, what did he put
in our milkshake machine?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.704
I have no idea. Look at
the size of those grapes.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.056
Those are beets, Jake.

12:34.884 --> 12:37.278
[sniffing]
Oh. Oh.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.714
Oh, you know what?
This reminds me:

12:38.758 --> 12:40.368
we need to change the filter
in the aquarium.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.238
Oh.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.980
Uh...

12:44.024 --> 12:45.199
all right, now let's toast

12:45.242 --> 12:46.809
to a long and healthy
future together.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.942
Come on. Come on.[groans]

12:48.985 --> 12:50.421
Cheers.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.249
[grunts]Ooh.

12:56.863 --> 12:57.733
Wow. It's, uh...

13:05.567 --> 13:07.482
Nope.

13:12.748 --> 13:13.836
It's like one of those old
dollars in a vending machine.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.534
It just won't go down.

13:16.578 --> 13:19.537
Oh. I...

13:19.581 --> 13:21.670
Ugh.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.106
I think I just got
a whole onion. [chuckles]

13:25.456 --> 13:28.720
You guys can do it, I promise.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.113
Bottoms up, come on.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.419
[moaning]Go on. Come on.

13:36.728 --> 13:39.209
Ugh...

13:39.253 --> 13:42.169
My compliments to the goose
that pooped in this glass.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.915
[stomach rumbling]

13:51.700 --> 13:53.658
It's only been three
days and our bodies

13:53.702 --> 13:56.705
are already settling into
their sexy new shapes.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.621
Oh, my God, this is torture.
I'm starving!

13:59.664 --> 14:01.231
[groans]

14:01.275 --> 14:03.538
And all our old food
is just downstairs,

14:03.581 --> 14:05.279
waiting for garbage day.

14:05.322 --> 14:08.238
Baby Ruth.Mmm.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.111
Little Debbie.Oh...

14:11.154 --> 14:13.765
The Sour Patch Kids.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.855
They're just children, Jake.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.857
Not the babies.[cries]: No!

14:17.900 --> 14:19.293
We should go check on them,
see how they're doing.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.035
No, no, no. We have to stop
enabling each other.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.906
[sighs]

14:23.950 --> 14:25.908
You're right.
You're right.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.998
Let's just turn off the
lights, go to sleep.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
Yeah.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.350
[squeals]

14:33.394 --> 14:34.786
Whoa!What the hell?

14:44.753 --> 14:47.495
Guys, I think we'd
better call Antoine.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.067
Fat Cooper's back.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.122
Hey, thanks
for seeing us, Antoine.

15:06.166 --> 15:09.082
My shoot's in a week, and
I was literally eating garbage.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.998
Uh-huh. Well, Cooper, before
I got fit, I used to roll over

15:12.041 --> 15:14.914
at 1:00 a.m. and text
Taco Bell, "You up?"

15:17.046 --> 15:19.135
We're gonna get
you back on track.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.095
Well, we are also ready
to start living healthier lives.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.966
Yeah.And your gym is so cool.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.099
Oh, thank you. Yeah, it
was very important for me

15:26.142 --> 15:28.710
to maintain the vibe of the
building's rich, rich history.

15:28.753 --> 15:29.885
What did this
space used to be?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.626
A slaughterhouse.

15:31.669 --> 15:35.499
Now, the next seven days
will not be easy,

15:35.543 --> 15:36.848
but I promise
they'll be worth it.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.111
All right?
Claire,

15:38.154 --> 15:39.721
why don't you, uh,
hit the heavy bag.

15:39.764 --> 15:41.810
Boys, let's start
with some burpees.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.987
Burpees. Okay, uh...

15:45.031 --> 15:47.250
[grunts]

15:47.294 --> 15:50.427
Should we, uh,
be... [grunts]

15:50.471 --> 15:52.777
Shouldn't we be easing
into this stuff?Excellent point.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.128
If you're struggling, feel free
to take things down a notch.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.391
Try some lunges. Yeah.Oh, cool.

15:57.434 --> 15:58.914
That should provide
plenty of time

15:58.958 --> 16:00.220
for another guy
to move in on Claire.

16:00.263 --> 16:02.396
Sorry, what?

16:02.439 --> 16:04.485
I'm just talking about
all the beefcake dudes

16:04.528 --> 16:06.878
on her Facebook page,
lurking,

16:06.922 --> 16:08.706
just waiting to take her
to pound town

16:08.750 --> 16:10.230
after you die!

16:10.273 --> 16:13.102
What... what the hell?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.931
Oh, Cooper let me in on
all your weaknesses and fears

16:15.975 --> 16:18.020
to help me motivate you.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.283
Well, I respond better
to positive reinforcements.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.634
Okay. Well, I'm positive that
Jeff Killroy's gonna be the man

16:23.678 --> 16:25.462
that teaches your son
how to ride a bike

16:25.506 --> 16:26.986
after you die!

16:28.552 --> 16:32.078
And Patrick Watson
is a sexy surfer

16:32.121 --> 16:34.428
with a shark bite scar that's
gonna fornicate with Claire

16:34.471 --> 16:35.646
after you die!

16:37.257 --> 16:38.780
Take it easy on him, Antoine.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.088
[laughs]
Oh, okay.

16:42.131 --> 16:45.395
Well, you know who's not gonna
take it easy on you, Claire?

16:45.439 --> 16:48.398
Society's physical expectations
of women over 30.

16:48.442 --> 16:51.445
Now, make like a widow
whose pension just ran out

16:51.488 --> 16:53.882
and get back to work!
Punch!

16:53.925 --> 16:55.710
You can do this, Claire!

16:55.753 --> 16:58.191
Shut your trap,
you bloated Bieber.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.844
Don't listen
to him, Cooper.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.542
He's just using
our fears against us.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.023
I know. Isn't
he the best?

17:04.066 --> 17:05.415
Faster!

17:05.459 --> 17:08.201
Harder! Come on![all groaning]

17:08.244 --> 17:09.550
Can I have some water?

17:09.593 --> 17:10.507
Yeah, I'll get you some water.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.988
After you die!

17:13.032 --> 17:14.990
[groaning, whimpering]

17:15.034 --> 17:16.731
Come on!
Hup, hup, hup!

17:24.043 --> 17:26.915
[groans]
Bad news, Claire.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.048
Dinner's ready.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.400
CLAIRE:
Man, these last six days
working out

17:33.443 --> 17:36.664
have left me
sore as hell, but I...

17:36.707 --> 17:39.797
[chuckles]
...have a surprise for you.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.582
Ba-bam.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.540
Ooh.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.934
Jeans buttoned andzipped.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.544
[laughs]Mm-hmm.

17:47.588 --> 17:50.112
Daddy likes what he sees

17:50.156 --> 17:51.896
and he sees what he likes.Ooh.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.946
I mean, these pants are-are so
tight that I can barely breathe,

17:57.989 --> 18:01.558
but, uh, maybe Dr. Dunk wants to
give me some mouth-to-mouth.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.430
Why don't you come down here

18:03.473 --> 18:05.997
so we can squish
our bodies together?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.477
Oh, your pants.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.392
Okay, here I come.Yeah.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.829
You better bring it to me,
little granny.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.744
[Claire grunts]Yeah, come here.

18:13.788 --> 18:16.878
[groans] Ow.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.880
[grunts]

18:18.923 --> 18:20.969
Okay.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.666
[both grunting]

18:22.710 --> 18:26.192
Ah, yeah.[both moan]

18:26.235 --> 18:27.628
Mmm.
Wait.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.020
Hold on,
I think I have to sneeze.

18:29.064 --> 18:30.370
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.806
Don't do that.
No, no, no, no, no.

18:31.849 --> 18:32.807
You're too close,
you'll make...

18:32.850 --> 18:34.374
[sneezes]Ow!

18:34.417 --> 18:36.202
Ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow.Ow, ow.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.681
JAKE: My muscles.CLAIRE: Ow. Ooh.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.467
Hiya, guys, we're... Okay!

18:40.510 --> 18:41.685
[whimpering]

18:41.729 --> 18:42.991
That's how you guys have sex?

18:43.034 --> 18:43.992
[Claire whimpers]

18:44.035 --> 18:45.950
Ugh.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.039
No, we're just too sore to move.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.563
Can you please
just help us get up?[moans]

18:49.606 --> 18:52.000
Yes, of course.Ow.
Please.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.741
[grunts][groans]

18:53.784 --> 18:56.004
[laughs][groans] Ooh.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.179
[both continue groaning]

18:57.223 --> 18:58.963
JAKE:
Thank you, Coops.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.182
How'd the photo shoot go?

19:00.226 --> 19:01.966
So amazing.
And I'm really grateful

19:02.010 --> 19:04.143
to you guys for helping me
get back into shape.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.970
And, and because of that,

19:06.014 --> 19:09.191
I wanted to share
something special with you.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.888
Oh.Good God.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.848
You look amazing.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.893
Wow, man. Is this
the, uh, one,

19:15.937 --> 19:17.765
Calvin Klein's gonna
put on the billboards?

19:17.808 --> 19:18.896
What?

19:20.507 --> 19:22.639
No, that's Fat Cooper.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.471
Are you kidding me?What the hell?

19:28.515 --> 19:30.212
I know. I barely
even have a six-pack.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.867
Oh, my... Dude,
you look the same.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.391
That's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.570
Can you believe this kid?

19:40.614 --> 19:42.920
Ugh, I know. G...

19:42.964 --> 19:44.835
I just got to keep looking
at this photo

19:44.879 --> 19:47.969
to remind myself
how mad I am.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.627
Stop.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.502
You know, honey, Cooper's
not the only reason

19:59.546 --> 20:01.200
I wanted to get into shape.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.376
I mean, my favorite
thing in life

20:03.419 --> 20:05.508
is to spend Friday nights
with you on the couch,

20:05.552 --> 20:07.858
and I want to do that
as long as I can.

20:07.902 --> 20:10.252
Yeah, same. [laughs]

20:10.296 --> 20:14.213
But I don't want to live forever
if this is how it's gonna feel.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.912
I mean, one of
the joys of marriage

20:17.955 --> 20:19.914
is being able
to let yourself go.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.133
Yeah.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.700
I never realized that health

20:23.744 --> 20:25.224
was the worst part of
"in sickness and in health."

20:29.924 --> 20:31.969
Let's just try to live healthier
during the week,

20:32.013 --> 20:33.710
but then on weekends

20:33.754 --> 20:35.277
just be garbage people.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.672
Absolutely.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.761
And, uh, since we're
on the same page here,

20:40.804 --> 20:43.285
I feel like I can
admit to you that I...

20:43.329 --> 20:44.721
never actually
threw away our food.

20:44.765 --> 20:45.548
You didn't?

20:47.115 --> 20:49.073
[gasps]

20:49.117 --> 20:51.032
[both scream]

20:51.075 --> 20:52.816
[laughs]

20:52.860 --> 20:54.557
Our babies.Yes.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.298
[screams]

20:56.342 --> 20:59.301
Oh, Mommy and Daddy
love you so much.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.346
Mmm.
