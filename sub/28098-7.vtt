WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:05.824
She's the most hated woman in America.

00:05.826 --> 00:08.294
Previously on "The Enemy Within"...

00:08.296 --> 00:10.013
CIA Agent Erica Shepherd

00:10.014 --> 00:12.081
spied for rogue terrorist Mikhail Tal.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.850
Mikhail Vassily Tal,
former Russian SVR agent

00:14.852 --> 00:16.785
and one of the greatest threats
to America today.

00:18.022 --> 00:19.588
I wanna bring in Erica Shepherd.

00:19.590 --> 00:21.223
She knows Tal better than anyone.

00:21.225 --> 00:23.008
She killed my fiancÃ©e.
Did you forget that?

00:23.010 --> 00:24.827
I'll see you in three days. I love you.

00:24.829 --> 00:26.395
I love you too.

00:26.397 --> 00:28.030
I need to know why you did it.

00:28.032 --> 00:30.933
I didn't work with Tal.
I didn't spy for him.

00:30.935 --> 00:32.368
She is a beautiful girl.

00:32.369 --> 00:33.569
Wait! Wait!

00:33.571 --> 00:35.853
I made a choice to save my daughter.

00:36.474 --> 00:38.347
Working with Shepherd, is
this gonna be a regular thing?

00:38.380 --> 00:39.993
I know Daniel and Kate
aren't happy about it.

00:39.995 --> 00:41.088
And you are?

00:41.113 --> 00:43.152
I mean, I agreed to work
with you and everything, right?

00:44.187 --> 00:46.215
Mikhail Tal is still at large.

00:46.217 --> 00:48.651
I suggest you stop relying
on the advice of a traitor.

00:48.653 --> 00:49.952
Shepherd is part of the reason

00:49.977 --> 00:51.904
we're closer than we've ever
been at catching Tal.

00:51.906 --> 00:54.123
Assuming she doesn't still work for him.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:12.175 --> 01:13.324
Hello?

01:13.326 --> 01:14.725
Hello, Jane.

01:15.661 --> 01:17.603
It happens today.

01:18.765 --> 01:20.498
No, I can't.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.200
Then just as we discussed,

01:23.202 --> 01:25.970
your secret will be revealed.

01:28.908 --> 01:30.608
Okay, I'll do it.

02:40.213 --> 02:43.380
I know, it's a dinosaur.
Belonged to my dad.

02:46.986 --> 02:48.786
- Old school.
- Yeah.

02:49.772 --> 02:51.505
I like it.

02:57.063 --> 02:58.129
I've got something.

02:58.131 --> 03:00.598
Yesterday morning,
a 31-year-old NSA analyst

03:00.600 --> 03:01.999
named Jane Eaton stole a piece

03:02.001 --> 03:03.767
of highly classified software
from her agency.

03:03.769 --> 03:04.822
What kind of software?

03:04.847 --> 03:06.504
It's financial cloaking technology.

03:06.529 --> 03:08.823
It basically allows someone
to make an online transaction

03:08.825 --> 03:10.808
without a bank or government
being able to track it.

03:10.810 --> 03:14.044
It's handy if you're
a terrorist or a rogue nation.

03:14.046 --> 03:17.231
Or in this case, Mikhail Tal.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.316
A deep dive into our contacts proves that

03:19.318 --> 03:21.769
she was in touch with him
or one of his operatives

03:21.771 --> 03:23.120
weeks leading up to the theft.

03:23.122 --> 03:25.120
We think that Tal leveraged this analyst

03:25.122 --> 03:26.824
into working for him by blackmailing her

03:26.826 --> 03:28.692
with some damaging personal information.

03:28.694 --> 03:30.761
That's how he operates.
He finds someone's weakness

03:30.786 --> 03:32.663
and then exploits it.
Where's the analyst now?

03:32.665 --> 03:34.165
She was leaving the NSA campus

03:34.167 --> 03:35.499
when something happened.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.816
Her car careened off the road

04:08.818 --> 04:10.100
and tumbled into a ravine.

04:10.102 --> 04:11.902
She was pronounced dead on the scene.

04:11.904 --> 04:14.955
But the classified software
that was meant for Tal

04:14.957 --> 04:16.724
was still found on her body.

04:16.726 --> 04:19.360
The local police had been ordered
to keep the accident quiet.

04:19.362 --> 04:21.545
Even NSA doesn't know about the breach.

04:21.547 --> 04:22.746
Why?

04:22.748 --> 04:25.716
I am tired of sitting back

04:25.718 --> 04:27.935
and letting Tal take the fight to us.

04:29.155 --> 04:32.189
We're gonna turn the tables
on him, go on offense.

04:32.191 --> 04:34.510
And this USB drive is how
we're gonna do it.

04:34.512 --> 04:36.360
We're gonna impersonate the dead analyst

04:36.362 --> 04:39.814
so that we can pass stolen NSA
technology to Tal's contact.

04:39.839 --> 04:41.832
But only after we secretly program it

04:41.834 --> 04:43.360
with tracking software

04:43.362 --> 04:44.935
Once he uses the tech,

04:44.937 --> 04:46.870
we'll be able to track him down.

04:46.872 --> 04:49.676
Not one of his operatives,
not some asset.

04:49.678 --> 04:51.191
Tal.

04:54.180 --> 04:57.914
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:01.053 --> 05:04.040
So you've got the tech
and you've got the plan,

05:04.041 --> 05:05.073
what do you need from me?

05:05.098 --> 05:06.879
Well, we know the NSA agent
was planning to meet

05:06.904 --> 05:09.010
one of Tal's contacts,
but we didn't know where

05:09.012 --> 05:09.978
and we didn't know when.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.294
That's where you come in.

05:11.849 --> 05:14.449
We found this coded message
on the analyst's body.

05:14.451 --> 05:16.351
We think it's instructions on how

05:16.353 --> 05:18.086
to get the NSA tech to Tal.

05:18.088 --> 05:20.922
You ever seen anything like this before?

05:23.148 --> 05:24.433
Yes.

05:25.229 --> 05:26.685
Can you crack it?

06:11.608 --> 06:14.709
Kate, what location's latitude 39.28,

06:14.711 --> 06:17.462
and 76.60 longitude?

06:20.184 --> 06:23.985
It's a park called
Emory Park Falls in Maryland.

06:23.987 --> 06:27.656
That's the location, 3:00 today.

06:27.658 --> 06:28.807
You cracked it?

06:28.809 --> 06:31.393
Most of the code is just noise

06:31.395 --> 06:32.961
meant to confuse and confound.

06:32.963 --> 06:34.863
The key information is found
in the corner

06:34.865 --> 06:36.598
surrounded by a Fibonacci Sequence.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.367
That's a series of numbers
where each number

06:39.369 --> 06:40.852
is the sum of the two that proceed it.

06:40.854 --> 06:44.206
So one plus one is two,
two plus one is three,

06:44.208 --> 06:46.374
three plus two is five.

06:46.376 --> 06:49.010
- So that's the code?
- No, that's what isolates it.

06:49.012 --> 06:50.979
The code is what's inside the circle.

06:50.981 --> 06:52.027
Everything else is useless.

06:52.306 --> 06:55.684
This is the location
and this is the date, today.

06:57.054 --> 06:58.853
All right, Daniel call
Bragg and Pettigrew.

06:58.855 --> 07:00.188
We need someone at that park ASAP.

07:00.190 --> 07:01.423
I want surveillance cameras set up

07:01.425 --> 07:03.441
and I wanna prep that site
for the exchange.

07:03.443 --> 07:05.460
We only get one shot at this.
We gotta move.

07:11.969 --> 07:14.202
You're gonna be the one to make the pass.

07:14.204 --> 07:17.138
The NSA analyst was about
your age, dark hair.

07:17.140 --> 07:18.673
So whoever she was supposed to meet

07:18.675 --> 07:21.610
will be looking for someone
who fits that description.

07:21.612 --> 07:23.278
There must be 100 FBI agents

07:23.280 --> 07:25.463
that look like her. Why me?

07:25.465 --> 07:27.549
I don't have the time
to vet other agents right now.

07:27.551 --> 07:30.183
And after Anna Cruz,
I can't afford to trust anyone.

07:30.687 --> 07:32.561
You trust me, Agent Keaton?

07:33.223 --> 07:34.604
Not for a second.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.158
But what I do know, what I can trust,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.442
is that you wanna catch Tal
as much as I do.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.930
FBI will maintain a secure perimeter

07:41.932 --> 07:42.864
around you at all times.

07:43.094 --> 07:45.267
We're gonna closely monitor
that GPS transponder

07:45.269 --> 07:46.434
in your chest.

07:46.436 --> 07:50.472
But Shepherd, don't make me regret this.

07:56.580 --> 07:57.879
So Shepherd's just gonna be free?

07:57.881 --> 08:00.015
That's what Keaton said.

08:00.017 --> 08:01.366
It's a bad idea.

08:01.368 --> 08:03.018
We'll have extra agents on site

08:03.020 --> 08:04.552
and we'll be monitoring her every move.

08:04.554 --> 08:06.554
Besides, she's still got
that GPS tracker in her chest.

08:06.556 --> 08:07.669
She beat it once already.

08:07.694 --> 08:10.275
Yeah, but that was before
I was on the team.

08:10.277 --> 08:12.877
All I'm saying is, it's a big park,

08:12.879 --> 08:14.796
and she's shifty as hell.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.865
Hey, Daniel, you up to speed
on this Shepherd op?

08:16.867 --> 08:18.433
- Yeah, why?
- You think it's a good idea?

08:18.435 --> 08:20.335
- I think it's a great idea.
- You do?

08:20.337 --> 08:22.203
- Of course.
- Why?

08:22.205 --> 08:25.206
Because Keaton's my boss,
and he says it's a great idea.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.782
You see, that's why
he's getting promoted next.

08:37.287 --> 08:38.937
Everybody ready?

08:38.938 --> 08:41.606
One minute until we take our positions.

08:41.607 --> 08:43.224
You're trying to look like the NSA woman,

08:43.226 --> 08:44.993
but you're a known figure.

08:44.995 --> 08:46.169
What if you get made?

08:46.194 --> 08:48.997
I just have to not look like
myself for three minutes.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.832
Everybody's in position. It's time.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.467
All right, here we go.

08:53.770 --> 08:57.322
You make the pass,
turn around, come back.

08:59.409 --> 09:00.875
Don't engage.

09:02.479 --> 09:04.946
This is for my team, but I want
you to hear this, Shepherd.

09:04.948 --> 09:08.316
One false move, one motion
that goes unaccounted for,

09:08.318 --> 09:10.285
the director's given us express authority

09:10.287 --> 09:11.386
to shoot to kill.

09:11.411 --> 09:13.571
This is as short a leash as
anybody's ever been on.

09:36.446 --> 09:38.561
Don't get any ideas.

09:39.218 --> 09:40.859
I know why I'm here.

09:50.527 --> 09:53.061
All right, it's 3:00.
Pettigrew, do you read?

09:53.063 --> 09:54.562
Copy.

10:07.094 --> 10:08.159
Daniel, how's your feed?

10:08.161 --> 10:09.717
It looks good from here.

10:18.021 --> 10:20.655
Someone at your landing, male, mid-40s.

10:20.657 --> 10:22.507
Okay, he's your guy.

10:24.761 --> 10:26.494
Greenlight. Shepherd.

10:28.615 --> 10:32.534
No, wait. We have a second possible.

10:33.670 --> 10:35.503
It's a male coming from the west.

10:36.973 --> 10:40.275
I see him, the kid.

10:44.030 --> 10:46.421
Kid doesn't look like
he's dressed for this weather.

10:47.451 --> 10:48.566
He doesn't plan to be here long.

10:48.568 --> 10:49.986
Go with the kid. He's your guy.

10:49.988 --> 10:51.551
Make the pass.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.064
Do you have the software?

11:05.886 --> 11:07.150
Yeah.

11:08.638 --> 11:12.140
Okay. Thanks.

11:14.177 --> 11:16.544
Do you have your instruction?

11:16.546 --> 11:19.330
What are you doing, Shepherd?
I told you not to engage.

11:19.332 --> 11:20.915
I'm going in.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.707
Wait, hold a beat.

11:23.153 --> 11:24.519
Sorry, what was that?

11:24.521 --> 11:26.171
Do you have your instructions?

11:26.173 --> 11:27.603
Uh, yeah, yeah.

11:27.628 --> 11:31.493
The TaskRaven listing said
it was like a banking software.

11:31.495 --> 11:33.761
Yeah, my colleagues and I,
we're trying to do

11:33.763 --> 11:36.397
- an investment startup.
- Oh, awesome.

11:36.399 --> 11:37.632
Uh, yeah, okay.

11:37.634 --> 11:39.634
So I'll get this back to you ASAP.

11:39.636 --> 11:41.786
- Thank you, appreciate it.
- Yeah.

11:42.606 --> 11:44.672
Shepherd, I told you
specifically not to engage.

11:44.674 --> 11:47.308
I needed to confirm
that he was a cut-out,

11:47.310 --> 11:48.943
that he didn't know
he was working for Tal.

11:48.945 --> 11:50.411
Get back to the van.

11:50.413 --> 11:51.861
I'm coming.

12:00.290 --> 12:02.957
My name is Braden Decker.
I'm 19 years old.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.415
The recipient was a grad student.

12:04.446 --> 12:05.960
Seems like he was telling
the truth about this

12:05.962 --> 12:07.269
being a TaskRaven job.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.163
Not everyone working
for Tal knows that they are.

12:09.165 --> 12:11.065
It makes it possible for Tal
to be the only one

12:11.067 --> 12:12.433
who sees the big picture.

12:12.435 --> 12:14.502
...Applied Mathematics when I was 16,

12:14.504 --> 12:16.838
and now I'm working on getting my Masters

12:16.840 --> 12:20.008
in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins.

12:20.010 --> 12:21.376
Parents died at a young age,

12:21.378 --> 12:23.645
financials say he put himself
through college.

12:23.647 --> 12:25.547
Makes sense he'd be a cut-out for Tal,

12:25.549 --> 12:27.715
exploits people's notable weaknesses.

12:27.717 --> 12:29.918
Pettigrew's tailing Decker now.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.568
Pettigrew, where's the kid?

12:32.188 --> 12:33.288
Internet cafÃ©.

12:33.313 --> 12:35.857
Got on a terminal
and plugged in the USB drive.

12:35.859 --> 12:38.092
He's uploading the software
from an anonymous location.

12:38.094 --> 12:41.629
- Has he met with anyone?
- No, it's a solo project.

12:41.631 --> 12:43.848
That tracks with him
being an unwitting accomplice.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.366
Stay on him.

12:47.103 --> 12:48.803
Guys, we got a hit.

12:48.805 --> 12:50.672
Tal just used the altered software.

12:50.674 --> 12:51.706
Can we locate Tal off of that?

12:51.708 --> 12:53.608
I just need to decrypt.

12:53.610 --> 12:55.727
The transaction ISP's are still cloaked,

12:55.729 --> 12:57.712
but you can use it to build
a positional profile.

12:57.714 --> 12:59.714
It's like the game Battleship.

12:59.716 --> 13:01.849
Every time Tal uses the program,

13:01.851 --> 13:03.751
we can use that data to narrow down

13:03.753 --> 13:05.253
where he's located.

13:07.023 --> 13:09.324
And the transaction was routed

13:09.326 --> 13:12.226
through an ISP in Newark.

13:16.132 --> 13:18.433
Tal is here. He's in this country.

13:20.904 --> 13:24.172
He wouldn't risk coming here
if it wasn't significant.

13:24.174 --> 13:25.607
Could be another attack.

13:25.609 --> 13:27.308
Whatever it is, this may be our best

13:27.310 --> 13:29.377
and only chance to get him.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.469
_

14:31.587 --> 14:32.707
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

14:32.709 --> 14:34.805
I think I must be in the wrong place.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.567
Are you here for the grief group?

14:37.443 --> 14:38.528
Yes.

14:38.553 --> 14:40.286
Then you're not in the wrong place.

14:40.896 --> 14:42.712
- Hi, my name's Anne.
- Will.

14:42.714 --> 14:44.325
Nice to meet you, Will.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.619
Is this your first time?

14:47.816 --> 14:48.830
Yeah.

14:50.219 --> 14:52.602
I remember how hard that was.

14:52.627 --> 14:55.545
I think this was the last place
in the world I wanted to be.

14:55.570 --> 14:58.204
I started coming to this group
four years ago

14:58.229 --> 14:59.799
after I lost my daughter.

15:00.304 --> 15:01.843
Sorry about that.

15:02.691 --> 15:03.928
Thank you.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.786
Well, why don't you come on in.

15:11.079 --> 15:12.579
Thank you.

15:16.064 --> 15:19.065
Can I ask what happened to your hand?

15:19.067 --> 15:21.434
It's, uh, work accident.

15:21.436 --> 15:23.158
Must have a pretty dangerous job.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.638
It can be.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.243
So, how'd you hear
about our little group?

15:27.559 --> 15:29.209
Co-worker of mine told me about it.

15:29.211 --> 15:30.710
It's nice to have people in your life

15:30.712 --> 15:32.206
who care about you.

15:35.683 --> 15:37.462
Why are you here, Will?

15:38.854 --> 15:40.465
Um...

15:41.590 --> 15:43.176
My fiancÃ©e, she, uh...

15:44.218 --> 15:46.293
she died about three weeks ago.

15:47.242 --> 15:49.176
I'm so sorry to hear that.

15:50.165 --> 15:52.666
Listen, I'm sorry.
I don't think this is for me.

15:52.668 --> 15:54.267
It's not usually all women, I promise.

15:54.269 --> 15:56.189
- No, I know. It's not that.
- I know.

15:56.638 --> 15:58.205
It's too soon, right?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.956
You're not ready to talk about your loss

15:59.958 --> 16:03.076
in front of a group of strangers.

16:04.873 --> 16:06.324
So don't.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.283
Don't say a word. You don't have to.

16:10.285 --> 16:13.553
Sometimes listening is enough.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.709
I sat here for a month without speaking.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.087
Now they make me run the meetings.

16:20.968 --> 16:23.090
It does help, Will.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.076
Hello, everyone.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.939
Welcome to the grief support group.

16:38.487 --> 16:39.953
My name's Anne,

16:39.978 --> 16:44.747
and I lost my daughter Molly
four years ago.

17:09.411 --> 17:11.211
Thank you.

17:17.853 --> 17:21.320
Guys, Tal made another transaction.

17:21.323 --> 17:23.080
He's on the Eastern Seaboard.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.406
Tal is here. We have to
take advantage of this.

17:24.691 --> 17:26.760
You keep honing in on him,
I'll have Molinero

17:26.762 --> 17:28.828
get the East Coast
tactical team on standby.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.096
Okay.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.070
What are you doing?

18:12.521 --> 18:14.327
Watching your screen.

18:15.324 --> 18:17.357
Is that not allowed?

18:17.359 --> 18:20.160
- No, that's okay.
- Are you sure?

18:20.162 --> 18:21.761
'Cause if you have something
to say, Kate,

18:21.763 --> 18:23.530
you should say it.

18:25.267 --> 18:28.301
No, let's move on.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.886
I came to see you personally.

19:15.133 --> 19:16.847
What does that mean to you?

19:17.636 --> 19:20.687
That we have something
important to discuss.

19:24.559 --> 19:28.401
I can assure you, all is going
according to plan.

19:29.097 --> 19:32.949
You assure me?
You give me your assurances?

19:32.951 --> 19:34.734
We first agreed to collaborate

19:34.736 --> 19:37.070
because of a shared philosophy.

19:37.072 --> 19:39.372
We will achieve what
we set out to achieve,

19:39.374 --> 19:43.576
and we will do so in the form of action.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.598
I still don't have
an operative in position.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.183
Has to be the right moment.

19:50.185 --> 19:52.800
The FBI, they remain a problem.

19:53.538 --> 19:55.928
Let me see what I can do on that front.

19:58.076 --> 19:59.227
Please do.

20:08.103 --> 20:11.338
Once those TAC teams are
100% ready, you let me know.

20:28.206 --> 20:29.989
We got a problem.

20:36.281 --> 20:38.998
We just flagged Tal's
most recent activity.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.634
150,000 was wired to a U.S. account,

20:41.636 --> 20:44.371
and the wire has a subject code of "KO".

20:44.373 --> 20:45.541
That's kill order.

20:45.566 --> 20:47.200
U.S. account,
most likely a hit on our soil.

20:47.225 --> 20:49.248
- Do we know the target?
- There's no name,

20:49.250 --> 20:52.032
but there is a four-digit code
attached that we can't account for.

20:52.057 --> 20:55.148
It's the last four digits of the
target's Social Security number.

20:55.150 --> 20:57.448
- Yeah.
- I'm running the SSN now.

20:58.103 --> 21:01.952
You don't have to. It's Braden Decker.

21:07.496 --> 21:08.978
She's right.

21:10.377 --> 21:12.098
Tal's gonna take him out.

21:27.214 --> 21:29.341
So Braden Decker played his role,

21:29.366 --> 21:32.051
Tal's gonna take him out.
That synchs up with his method.

21:32.053 --> 21:33.937
Decker's got hours, not days.

21:33.939 --> 21:35.522
We need to bring him in.

21:35.524 --> 21:36.750
What?

21:38.026 --> 21:41.027
You intervene and try to save his life,

21:41.482 --> 21:42.812
and the gambit is ruined.

21:42.814 --> 21:45.120
Tal will know that you're tracking him.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.248
So you just wanna let him die?

21:49.487 --> 21:51.669
I wanna catch Tal.

21:52.190 --> 21:53.773
A kid's life is in danger.

21:53.775 --> 21:56.275
I'm sorry, you're recommending
that we don't do anything?

21:56.277 --> 21:59.078
I am recommending that
you let this mission proceed

21:59.080 --> 22:01.697
- to its objective completion.
- "Objective completion"?

22:01.699 --> 22:02.999
Let's call this what it is,

22:03.001 --> 22:04.144
you're signing this kid's death warrant.

22:04.169 --> 22:06.502
- You don't know that.
- Kid's got no tradecraft.

22:06.504 --> 22:07.641
He's a sitting duck.

22:07.643 --> 22:10.039
Sometimes in matters of intelligence,

22:10.041 --> 22:13.107
the best choice is distasteful.

22:13.294 --> 22:14.961
But that doesn't make it wrong.

22:14.963 --> 22:16.763
It doesn't mean that it's right.

22:18.612 --> 22:21.365
You are so close to ending Tal.

22:21.853 --> 22:24.353
No more tragedies, no more attacks.

22:24.355 --> 22:28.107
I am asking you to make
a choice for the greater good.

22:28.109 --> 22:32.645
One life to potentially save
countless more.

22:32.647 --> 22:37.316
- One life for Tal's.
- Absolutely not, no.

22:37.318 --> 22:40.036
I'm not gonna allow
an innocent person to die.

22:42.123 --> 22:45.541
Whether Braden Decker is
innocent or not is immaterial.

22:45.543 --> 22:49.078
You make one move that lets
Tal know that you're onto him,

22:49.080 --> 22:50.830
and he goes to ground.

22:50.832 --> 22:52.730
We'll find another way.

22:57.639 --> 23:00.056
This is just like Anna Cruz.

23:02.677 --> 23:05.576
Your lapse in judgment
set them back months.

23:06.231 --> 23:09.747
You lose Tal now and once again
all of the blame,

23:10.068 --> 23:12.318
and everything it brings,

23:12.320 --> 23:14.737
falls squarely on your shoulders.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.159
Shepherd, a word.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.921
Look at this without emotion
for just a second.

23:31.923 --> 23:33.256
You're a hypocrite.

23:33.258 --> 23:34.540
You claim to be a patriot,

23:34.542 --> 23:36.607
you even invoke "the greater good."

23:37.045 --> 23:39.178
But given the same exact
set of circumstances,

23:39.180 --> 23:41.097
you chose to save one civilian

23:41.099 --> 23:42.905
over the lives of four other people.

23:43.935 --> 23:45.824
I didn't choose this.

23:46.437 --> 23:49.138
A choice is made in free will.

23:49.140 --> 23:51.357
I was forced to make
a heartbreaking decision,

23:51.359 --> 23:53.776
a decision that haunts me
every single day.

23:53.778 --> 23:56.293
So Hannah's life was worth
more than Braden's,

23:57.031 --> 23:59.004
or for that matter, Laine's?

24:01.035 --> 24:02.132
I get it.

24:02.654 --> 24:04.987
I get it. You see everything,
don't you, Shepherd?

24:04.989 --> 24:06.804
You see the whole chessboard,

24:07.375 --> 24:09.458
but that doesn't give you
the right to play God.

24:09.460 --> 24:10.724
Oh, no.

24:11.963 --> 24:14.436
You are God in this scenario.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.398
You control my fate.

24:18.169 --> 24:20.303
You control whether or not
I see my daughter.

24:20.305 --> 24:22.054
You control whether or not
I catch the man

24:22.056 --> 24:23.296
that destroyed my life.

24:23.321 --> 24:26.058
Exactly, because I've earned
the right to make those calls

24:26.060 --> 24:28.060
based on the decisions that I've made.

24:28.409 --> 24:31.036
Just like you've lost your rights
based on decisions you've made.

24:36.271 --> 24:38.154
What do you intend to do?

24:51.286 --> 24:52.952
All right, listen up.

24:52.954 --> 24:55.746
Decker's life is in danger,
we need to protect him.

24:55.748 --> 24:58.591
But this is also our first
legitimate line on Tal,

24:58.593 --> 25:00.092
so we're gonna play it both ways.

25:00.094 --> 25:01.427
Bragg, you link up with Pettigrew.

25:01.429 --> 25:03.229
Put a protective perimeter around Decker

25:03.231 --> 25:04.662
while we hone in on Tal.

25:04.664 --> 25:05.919
Don't contact Decker,

25:05.944 --> 25:08.017
don't alert anyone that we're watching.

25:08.019 --> 25:10.686
At this rate, it's only gonna be
a couple of hours before we have

25:10.688 --> 25:11.858
Tal in our sights.

25:14.976 --> 25:16.776
Pettigrew, where's Decker?

25:16.778 --> 25:19.362
Left the internet cafÃ©, he's on the move.

25:19.364 --> 25:21.314
Okay, Tal's tasking
a professional hitter to him.

25:21.316 --> 25:24.317
Bragg is on his way with a security
team to your position right now

25:24.319 --> 25:26.369
to establish a secure, silent perimeter.

25:26.371 --> 25:28.738
- That's not gonna be easy.
- Why's that?

25:28.740 --> 25:30.623
Decker's headed to Ammendale Racetrack.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.541
The horse track? What's he doing there?

25:32.543 --> 25:34.076
Not clear.

25:34.078 --> 25:35.141
All right, you stay on him.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.246
Bragg and the HRT team
will be there soon.

25:37.248 --> 25:38.464
Copy that.

25:39.078 --> 25:42.051
A racetrack is a tactically
challenging place to lock down.

25:42.053 --> 25:43.970
One false move
from your protective detail,

25:43.972 --> 25:47.390
Tal will be alerted. He will vanish.

25:47.392 --> 25:48.724
Team will only have to keep Decker secure

25:48.726 --> 25:50.866
for a little while longer. We'll be fine.

25:53.348 --> 25:55.014
Does that get us closer
to Tal's location?

25:55.016 --> 25:57.016
- Southeast D.C.
- We got him, Will.

25:57.018 --> 25:58.734
One or two more hits max

25:58.736 --> 26:02.252
and we can have
Tal's exact GPS coordinates.

26:04.025 --> 26:05.074
Daniel, you're with me.

26:05.076 --> 26:06.942
Kate, as soon as those
coordinates come in,

26:06.944 --> 26:08.244
you let me know.

26:08.246 --> 26:11.080
We're gonna be in position
to take Tal down.

26:32.192 --> 26:34.743
You know, you made the
right call back there, Will,

26:34.745 --> 26:36.203
with Shepherd.

26:38.582 --> 26:39.831
Kate, where are we?

26:40.450 --> 26:41.866
Once Tal uses the program again,

26:41.868 --> 26:44.266
I'll be able to give you
more detailed coordinates.

26:52.045 --> 26:54.095
Murphy's Law going for the lead.

26:54.097 --> 26:56.014
Cinnamon Girl on the far outside

26:56.016 --> 26:58.383
and Cash Money on the inside.

26:58.385 --> 27:00.802
The Blueberry Girl now making slow move

27:00.804 --> 27:03.638
up the middle.
Murphy's Law, Cinnamon Girl...

27:03.640 --> 27:06.725
Murphy's Law and it's gonna be
Cinnamon Girl

27:06.727 --> 27:08.309
off stride and the wire.

27:08.311 --> 27:09.611
Silent cover.

27:09.949 --> 27:12.313
TAC-team on the perimeter,
plainclothes fall in

27:12.315 --> 27:13.698
on a tighter follow.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.533
Keep this quiet until we can't.

27:15.535 --> 27:17.535
Any sign of the hitter,
any sign of anything,

27:17.537 --> 27:20.572
we collapse the envelope
and save the kid, all right?

27:20.574 --> 27:21.790
Okay.

27:30.050 --> 27:31.758
Ladies and Gentlemen, our next race

27:31.783 --> 27:34.552
will be the eighth running
on the Ammendale Invitational,

27:34.554 --> 27:37.172
and we have a $50,000 guarantee.

27:37.174 --> 27:41.059
This will be an invitational
handicap for your own basis

27:41.061 --> 27:43.311
at a distance of one mile.

27:45.482 --> 27:49.067
Most times of that race
is just under five minutes.

27:56.610 --> 27:59.411
Another civilian
just sat down next to him.

28:03.617 --> 28:07.419
And... his name is Oscar Bishop.

28:07.421 --> 28:08.703
He went to Hopkins with Decker,

28:08.705 --> 28:10.371
but he dropped out after one year.

28:10.373 --> 28:12.006
And since then it looks like
he's been doing

28:12.008 --> 28:14.092
some mid-level hacker work.

28:14.628 --> 28:16.928
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- Yeah.

28:16.930 --> 28:18.430
Let me see it.

28:25.472 --> 28:27.355
Could you analyze that for me?

28:28.275 --> 28:30.910
If the upload architecture is what
you described, I don't need to.

28:31.561 --> 28:34.612
That's NSA proprietary, 100%.

28:34.614 --> 28:37.449
There's a lot of people who'd be
very interested in what you have.

28:39.202 --> 28:41.069
Why didn't you tell me that on the phone?

28:41.071 --> 28:42.821
'Cause I wanna buy it.

28:43.163 --> 28:44.789
I'll give you 200 grand.

28:49.629 --> 28:51.830
- No, I don't wanna sell it.
- Then what's your plan?

28:51.832 --> 28:55.717
I'll give it back to the NSA. I need to.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.637
Dude, they will crucify you.

28:59.639 --> 29:01.174
Whether or not you wanna admit this,

29:01.199 --> 29:04.425
you're now an accessory
to a very serious cybercrime.

29:04.427 --> 29:05.977
I'll tell the truth.

29:05.979 --> 29:07.062
- The truth?
- Yeah.

29:07.087 --> 29:08.980
That you got it from
some lady at a waterfall

29:08.982 --> 29:10.515
for a TaskRaven job?

29:10.517 --> 29:12.350
I'm on your side,
and I barely believe it.

29:12.352 --> 29:15.779
Braden, sell it or walk away.

29:16.490 --> 29:18.365
I can't do either.

29:19.659 --> 29:23.361
I can't be here. Good luck.

29:25.866 --> 29:27.207
Wai...

29:30.787 --> 29:32.151
We got a hit.

29:32.176 --> 29:34.923
Atlantic Street, it looks like
an industrial tract.

29:36.009 --> 29:37.542
Got it.

29:42.766 --> 29:45.016
Daniel, if we find them,
you know there's no version

29:45.018 --> 29:47.602
of this where Tal's gonna allow
himself to be arrested.

29:47.604 --> 29:49.740
He's not gonna hesitate, so we can't.

29:49.742 --> 29:51.439
Understood.

30:05.205 --> 30:06.871
Pride and Joy holding the lead

30:06.873 --> 30:10.708
with Challenger to take up
by the furlong hold.

30:10.710 --> 30:12.877
And it's Pride and Joy by her...

30:12.879 --> 30:14.412
We got a possible Tal operative

30:14.414 --> 30:16.381
moving towards Decker.

30:16.383 --> 30:19.083
Mighty Mo making a charge to the outside.

30:19.085 --> 30:20.552
He needs to hold off.

30:20.554 --> 30:21.920
You don't have enough to find Tal.

30:21.922 --> 30:23.888
Bragg, hold off as long as you can.

30:33.733 --> 30:36.150
Heads up, Collins, he's coming your way.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.109
Damn it, we've been made.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.110
Hitter neutralized.

31:19.112 --> 31:20.278
Send the team to the stairwell,

31:20.280 --> 31:21.312
take him into custody.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.365
Pettigrew, do you still
have eyes on the kid?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.325
I got him.

31:26.842 --> 31:28.175
That's it.

31:28.288 --> 31:30.288
Keaton, we have a positive location,

31:30.290 --> 31:34.375
It's 1324 Meadowbrook Terrace.
It's an industrial space.

31:34.377 --> 31:35.960
Meadowbrook Terrace, got it.

31:38.715 --> 31:40.298
All right, this is it.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.916
You ready?

31:49.726 --> 31:51.092
Gun!

31:53.313 --> 31:55.647
Damn it, engage! Engage!

31:55.649 --> 31:56.780
No!

32:02.522 --> 32:04.022
Shooter down! Shooter down!

32:04.024 --> 32:06.324
Call an ambulance, all right?
Call an ambulance!

32:06.326 --> 32:07.608
Jacquie, you all right?

32:07.610 --> 32:09.494
Jacquie, you all right? Stay with me.

32:09.496 --> 32:11.329
I swear, we're gonna get you out of here.

32:12.355 --> 32:14.032
We're gonna get you
out of here, all right?

32:14.057 --> 32:16.034
You're fine, you're fine.
You're doing all right.

32:16.036 --> 32:17.869
Stay with me, come on.

32:55.458 --> 32:57.458
Let's circle back downstairs.

32:57.460 --> 32:59.544
No, we missed him.

33:00.497 --> 33:01.923
He's gone.

33:18.007 --> 33:19.506
Rest easy.

33:19.508 --> 33:22.009
The software's been safely
returned to the NSA,

33:22.011 --> 33:23.610
and they're confident
they can troubleshoot

33:23.612 --> 33:25.379
anything that might have been done.

33:26.782 --> 33:28.782
I didn't mean to cause all this.

33:29.919 --> 33:31.318
Well, you didn't.

33:31.320 --> 33:34.321
You just got involved
with the wrong people.

33:34.323 --> 33:36.498
You were trying to do the right thing.

33:37.777 --> 33:41.962
The agent who saved me,
is she gonna be okay?

33:43.165 --> 33:45.866
Well, she's in the hospital now,

33:45.868 --> 33:48.035
but she's tough.

34:07.390 --> 34:08.956
Hey.

34:11.659 --> 34:12.976
She's doing okay.

34:12.978 --> 34:15.228
Doctor said he's confident, so...

34:16.454 --> 34:19.666
They got her knocked out
on the good stuff right now.

34:23.418 --> 34:24.737
Hate to say this,

34:24.739 --> 34:28.708
but, um, kinda grown to care about her.

34:28.710 --> 34:31.052
You'll have to tell her that
when she wakes up.

34:31.813 --> 34:34.138
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.850
Gonna get a coffee, you want one?

34:36.851 --> 34:40.621
No, no. I'll catch up with you later.

34:50.099 --> 34:51.822
Gave us quite a scare, Jacquie.

34:52.735 --> 34:54.234
But you'll be happy to know that

34:54.235 --> 34:55.827
it wasn't a complete loss...

34:56.806 --> 34:59.173
wrapped up one of Decker's assassins.

34:59.175 --> 35:01.508
Daniel's gonna get him to talk.

35:01.510 --> 35:03.043
And all those payments that

35:03.045 --> 35:05.295
Tal made using the stolen tech...

35:07.547 --> 35:09.507
gave us a ton of new leads.

35:12.021 --> 35:13.620
Gonna be a thick file on your desk

35:13.622 --> 35:16.264
when you get out of here,
so you better be ready to work.

35:23.599 --> 35:25.516
I hate hospitals.

35:28.571 --> 35:30.820
When Laine was killed, I, uh,

35:31.941 --> 35:34.608
punched this wall so hard...

35:36.479 --> 35:39.446
Broke six bones in my hand.

35:40.716 --> 35:42.749
Had those bones set

35:42.751 --> 35:45.352
right here in this hospital
right down the hall.

35:50.826 --> 35:55.762
Doc said that the pain would
eventually go away...

35:58.033 --> 35:59.515
eventually it did.

36:01.350 --> 36:03.019
Some days...

36:05.800 --> 36:08.399
Some days my hand just
doesn't feel quite right.

36:11.277 --> 36:12.913
It feels different.

36:32.134 --> 36:33.634
Will, the CIA was just here.

36:33.636 --> 36:35.969
They just moved Tal's operative
out of holding.

36:35.971 --> 36:37.512
What? Where?

36:37.537 --> 36:39.806
An Agency Black Site,
said our security was too lax.

36:39.808 --> 36:42.042
Didn't want what happened
to Nemec to happen to this guy.

36:42.044 --> 36:43.601
- That wasn't our fault.
- I know.

36:43.630 --> 36:46.179
- They promise to share to Intel.
- Who authorized this?

36:46.181 --> 36:48.482
That's the thing, Will.
This was top down.

36:48.484 --> 36:50.317
Authorization came from the White House.

36:50.319 --> 36:52.052
National Security Advisor came down here

36:52.054 --> 36:53.854
to talk Molinero himself.

36:53.856 --> 36:55.589
NSC advisor?

36:55.591 --> 36:57.357
He just left.

37:13.409 --> 37:15.133
Is it done?

37:16.178 --> 37:17.427
It's done.

37:17.656 --> 37:18.762
I'll see to it that we don't have

37:18.787 --> 37:21.097
any more problems with the FBI.

38:08.464 --> 38:10.364
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:10.366 --> 38:12.566
Don't worry, you're in the right place.

38:12.568 --> 38:14.301
My name's Will.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.708
Beth.

38:16.041 --> 38:18.705
Pleasure to meet you, Beth.
This your first time?

38:18.707 --> 38:20.031
Yes.

38:20.843 --> 38:22.533
Come join us.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.163
Okay, everyone, let's get started.

38:28.417 --> 38:32.052
Welcome to the grief support group.

38:32.054 --> 38:34.087
My name is Will, and

38:34.757 --> 38:37.107
I lost my fiancÃ©e Laine three years ago.

38:38.394 --> 38:39.660
And...

39:01.283 --> 39:03.917
This was an outright loss, Agent Keaton.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.955
You had Tal in your grasp,
and you let him slip away.

39:08.957 --> 39:11.692
We saved an innocent civilian.
I'll stand by that.

39:11.694 --> 39:13.560
I was not gonna have
Braden Decker's blood

39:13.562 --> 39:14.752
on my hands.

39:18.233 --> 39:20.258
At what cost?

39:20.969 --> 39:22.569
How much more blood is gonna spill

39:22.571 --> 39:24.679
because Tal is still out there?

39:25.808 --> 39:29.176
You could have ended it today.

39:29.178 --> 39:32.478
You're worried about getting
blood on your fingernails?

39:33.437 --> 39:35.682
You're gonna be swimming in it.

39:36.752 --> 39:38.651
You wanna catch Tal,

39:39.088 --> 39:40.921
you wanna avenge Laine's death,

39:40.923 --> 39:42.322
you're gonna have to sacrifice

39:42.324 --> 39:44.658
a part of yourself, Agent Keaton.

39:44.660 --> 39:47.294
Catching Tal comes at a very high price

39:47.296 --> 39:49.620
and from the actions that I've seen,

39:50.733 --> 39:52.456
you're not willing to pay it.

39:53.268 --> 39:54.868
And you are?

39:57.086 --> 39:58.239
Absolutely.

39:58.241 --> 40:00.173
And how'd that work out for you?

40:03.345 --> 40:04.611
Tal's still out there running around

40:04.613 --> 40:05.879
taking innocent lives,

40:05.881 --> 40:08.347
and you're gonna die alone in this cage.

40:11.136 --> 40:12.536
You don't know my debt,

40:12.538 --> 40:15.396
you have no clue of what I've sacrificed.

40:16.258 --> 40:18.325
Talk about paying a high price,

40:18.327 --> 40:21.194
truth is, you have never gotten
the job done.

40:24.071 --> 40:26.733
I don't need to be a murderer
to catch one.

41:04.339 --> 41:05.705
Hello?

41:05.707 --> 41:07.876
_

41:07.878 --> 41:09.009
Erica.

41:09.011 --> 41:11.511
_

41:11.513 --> 41:13.480
I don't have much time.

41:13.482 --> 41:14.881
Are your contacts still in harness

41:14.883 --> 41:17.250
within Russian Intelligence, line KR?

41:17.252 --> 41:19.319
Yes, what do you need?

41:21.757 --> 41:24.090
I need to speak with Tal.
