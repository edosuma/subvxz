[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:36.500 --> 00:37.266
>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:37.333 --> 00:38.500
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:38.566 --> 00:39.666
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANK YOU SO

00:39.733 --> 00:41.233
MUCH FOR JOINING US, JUST TIME

00:41.300 --> 00:42.433
FOR A QUICK RECAP OF THE WEEK,

00:42.500 --> 00:43.333
WHICH HAS BEEN BUSY.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.966
THE HOUSE FINALLY PASSED THE BIG

00:45.033 --> 00:46.633
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.133
ABBA RELEASED ITS FIRST ALBUM

00:48.200 --> 00:49.200
IN 40 YEARS, SO YOU KNOW YOUR

00:49.266 --> 00:51.633
PARENTS ARE FUCKING TONIGHT.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.366
AND THE DEMOCRATS HAD A ROUGH

00:53.433 --> 00:54.866
TIME IN TUESDAY'S ELECTIONS.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.733
THEY LOST THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN

00:56.800 --> 00:58.966
VIRGINIA AND NEARLY LOST THE

00:59.033 --> 01:00.000
GOVERNORSHIP OF NEW JERSEY.

01:00.066 --> 01:03.666
BUT PERHAPS THE CLEAREST SIGN OF

01:03.733 --> 01:05.533
JUST HOW MUCH VOTERS HAVE TURNED

01:05.600 --> 01:06.033
ON THEM WAS THIS:

01:06.100 --> 01:07.033
>> THE TRUCK DRIVER WITH NO

01:07.100 --> 01:08.633
PRIOR POLITICAL EXPERIENCE HAS

01:08.700 --> 01:09.166
DEFEATED ONE OF THE MOST

01:09.233 --> 01:10.400
POWERFUL DEMOCRATS IN NEW

01:10.466 --> 01:12.833
JERSEY.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.800
>> HE IS REPUBLICAN EDWARD DURR

01:14.866 --> 01:15.533
AND HE HAS WON THE DISTRICT 3

01:15.600 --> 01:16.733
SENATE SEAT OVER INCUMBENT

01:16.800 --> 01:17.366
STEVE SWEENEY, THE STATE SENATE

01:17.433 --> 01:20.033
PRESIDENT.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.266
>> John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.633
I KNOW THERE IS A LOT TO PROCESS

01:22.700 --> 01:23.800
THERE: FROM A SURPRISE UPSET BY

01:23.866 --> 01:25.533
A MAN WITH NO POLITICAL

01:25.600 --> 01:26.266
EXPERIENCE, TO SOMEONE BEING

01:26.333 --> 01:27.433
CALLED ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL

01:27.500 --> 01:29.166
DEMOCRATS IN NEW JERSEY WHILE

01:29.233 --> 01:30.500
LOOKING LIKE DADDY DINOSAUR FROM

01:30.566 --> 01:32.633
"DINOSAURS."

01:32.700 --> 01:33.566
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T NEED TO BE

01:33.633 --> 01:34.166
TOLD IS THAT THE NAME OF HIS

01:34.233 --> 01:35.200
VANQUISHER -- THIS MAN --

01:35.266 --> 01:36.966
IS "ED DURR."

01:37.033 --> 01:38.366
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE THIS,

01:38.433 --> 01:39.333
THE "ED DURR" IS VERY MUCH

01:39.400 --> 01:41.033
ASSUMED.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.233
I SEE THIS IMAGE AND I

01:42.300 --> 01:44.200
IMMEDIATELY KNOW THREE THINGS:

01:44.266 --> 01:45.400
HE'S A WHITE MIDDLE-AGED GUY.

01:45.466 --> 01:47.200
HIS STYLE ICON IS LARRY KING.

01:47.266 --> 01:48.966
AND HIS NAME IS, UNAVOIDABLY,

01:49.033 --> 01:51.900
ED DURR.

01:51.966 --> 01:53.000
THIS WAS A HUGE UPSET, AND IF

01:53.066 --> 01:53.833
YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL, MAYBE

01:53.900 --> 01:55.366
ED DURR SIMPLY CAPTIVATED PEOPLE

01:55.433 --> 01:57.266
WITH HIS UNIQUE AND POWERFUL

01:57.333 --> 01:58.500
VISION FOR NEW JERSEY," GOOD

01:58.566 --> 02:00.466
LUCK LANDING THAT ARGUMENT.

02:00.533 --> 02:01.733
>> ED, WHAT'S THE FIRST THING

02:01.800 --> 02:03.266
YOU'RE GOING TO DO WHEN YOU GET

02:03.333 --> 02:06.900
TO THE CAPITOL IN TRENTON?

02:06.966 --> 02:09.233
>> UH, I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.133
THAT'S THE KEY FACTOR.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.533
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DON'T KNOW,

02:12.600 --> 02:14.333
SO I WILL LEARN WHAT I NEED TO

02:14.400 --> 02:15.933
KNOW.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.233
>> John: OH, COME ON, ED DURR.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.433
YOU COULD HAVE ANSWERED ANYTHING

02:19.500 --> 02:21.233
THERE.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.266
YOU COULD HAVE SAID "I'M GONNA

02:22.333 --> 02:23.200
LICK EVERY DOOR HANDLE" OR "GET

02:23.266 --> 02:24.233
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS EPSTEIN

02:24.300 --> 02:25.866
THING" OR YOU COULD HAVE JUST

02:25.933 --> 02:27.300
SAID, "DURR."

02:27.366 --> 02:29.566
ANY OF WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:29.633 --> 02:30.500
BETTER THAN "I DON'T KNOW."

02:30.566 --> 02:31.633
ALSO, WHAT'S HE WEARING THERE?

02:31.700 --> 02:33.033
BLACK ON RED?

02:33.100 --> 02:35.833
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S AUDITIONING

02:35.900 --> 02:36.800
TO BE THE NEWEST MEMBER OF

02:36.866 --> 02:39.566
MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE.

02:39.633 --> 02:40.433
THE ONLY TIME THAT COLOR

02:40.500 --> 02:41.633
COMBINATION IS REMOTELY

02:41.700 --> 02:42.366
ACCEPTABLE IS IF YOU'RE A

02:42.433 --> 02:43.066
MIDDLE SCHOOL BOY WHO WANTS HIS

02:43.133 --> 02:44.266
CLASSMATES TO KNOW THAT HE IS

02:44.333 --> 02:45.166
GONNA BUY A GUN AS SOON AS HE'S

02:45.233 --> 02:48.166
OLD ENOUGH.

02:48.233 --> 02:50.100
AND IT IS NOT JUST DURR'S LACK

02:50.166 --> 02:50.900
OF EXPERIENCE THAT'S TROUBLING

02:50.966 --> 02:51.300
HERE.

02:51.366 --> 02:52.166
HE'S COMPARED COVID MANDATES TO

02:52.233 --> 02:53.400
THE HOLOCAUST AND TWEETED THAT

02:53.466 --> 02:54.300
THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD WAS A

02:54.366 --> 02:54.966
PEDOPHILE AND ISLAM IS A FALSE

02:55.033 --> 02:56.633
RELIGION.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.033
ALL OF WHICH SUDDENLY MAKES ME A

02:58.100 --> 02:58.633
LOT LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:58.700 --> 02:59.866
THINGS ED DURR DOESN'T KNOW, AND

02:59.933 --> 03:01.966
WAY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:02.033 --> 03:04.666
THINGS HE THINKS HE DOES.

03:04.733 --> 03:05.433
NOW, MEANWHILE, PRESIDENT BIDEN

03:05.500 --> 03:06.333
TRAVELED TO THE COP26 CLIMATE

03:06.400 --> 03:07.833
SUMMIT THIS WEEK, WHERE WORLD

03:07.900 --> 03:08.866
LEADERS MET TO TACKLE THE MOST

03:08.933 --> 03:11.166
URGENT ISSUE OF OUR TIME, AND

03:11.233 --> 03:12.366
BIDEN DIDN'T GET OFF TO A GREAT

03:12.433 --> 03:14.200
START.

03:14.266 --> 03:15.033
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN IS AT THE

03:15.100 --> 03:16.433
U.N. CLIMATE SUMMIT IN SCOTLAND

03:16.500 --> 03:17.933
TODAY, AND DURING TODAY'S

03:18.000 --> 03:19.100
OPENING SESSION, YOU GUESSED IT,

03:19.166 --> 03:20.600
HE APPEARED TO FALL ASLEEP

03:20.666 --> 03:22.533
THERE.

03:22.600 --> 03:23.366
>> THIS CONFERENCE IS ONE OF THE

03:23.433 --> 03:24.300
MOST IMPORTANT MEETINGS IN

03:24.366 --> 03:27.633
HISTORY.

03:27.700 --> 03:28.933
>> John: YEAH.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.866
THAT'S NOT IDEAL, IS IT?

03:30.933 --> 03:32.200
"THIS CONFERENCE IS ONE OF THE

03:32.266 --> 03:32.900
MOST IMPORTANT MEETINGS IN

03:32.966 --> 03:34.133
HISTORY" IS ONE OF THE WORST

03:34.200 --> 03:35.800
THINGS SOMEONE CAN SAY AS YOU

03:35.866 --> 03:37.066
NOD OFF.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.366
IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH

03:38.433 --> 03:39.833
"YOU MAY NOW KISS THE BRIDE" OR

03:39.900 --> 03:42.700
"IN ONE MILE, EXIT HIGHWAY" OR

03:42.766 --> 03:43.333
"WELCOME TO 'LAST WEEK TONIGHT,'

03:43.400 --> 03:47.066
I'M JOHN OLIVER."

03:47.133 --> 03:48.700
THE CONFERENCE WAS FULL OF

03:48.766 --> 03:49.400
REMINDERS, BIG AND SMALL, OF

03:49.466 --> 03:50.433
JUST HOW SERIOUS THIS SITUATION

03:50.500 --> 03:51.766
IS, FROM THE MASSIVE PROTESTS

03:51.833 --> 03:54.433
OUTSIDE TO SOME OF THE DISPLAYS

03:54.500 --> 03:56.000
WITHIN.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.433
FOR EXAMPLE, THE TINY ISLAND

03:57.500 --> 03:58.200
NATION OF TUVALU, WHICH MAY SOON

03:58.266 --> 03:59.566
BE FLOODED OUT OF EXISTENCE

03:59.633 --> 04:01.666
THANKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE,

04:01.733 --> 04:02.866
INSTALLED THIS EXHIBIT,

04:02.933 --> 04:03.833
DEPICTING POLAR BEARS IN

04:03.900 --> 04:04.900
LIFE VESTS AND

04:04.966 --> 04:07.800
A PENGUIN IN A NOOSE.

04:07.866 --> 04:09.633
WHICH IS A STRIKING IMAGE, AND

04:09.700 --> 04:10.933
EITHER SUGGESTS TUVALU'S PLIGHT

04:11.000 --> 04:12.466
OR SOME KIND OF A TRAGIC

04:12.533 --> 04:13.700
SITUATION WHERE A

04:13.766 --> 04:15.200
GROUP OF POLAR BEARS COMMITTED A

04:15.266 --> 04:16.400
CRIME SO HEINOUS, THEY HAD TO

04:16.466 --> 04:17.666
KILL THE ONLY WITNESS -- AN

04:17.733 --> 04:18.766
INNOCENT PENGUIN -- AND MAKE IT

04:18.833 --> 04:20.433
LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE BEFORE

04:20.500 --> 04:21.766
POPPING ON THEIR GETAWAY

04:21.833 --> 04:23.066
LIFE VESTS AND ESCAPING TO START

04:23.133 --> 04:25.366
NEW, HAPPIER LIVES.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.966
IT'S ONE OF THOSE TWO THINGS.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.166
BUT THE MAIN ATTRACTION WAS

04:29.233 --> 04:33.933
CLEARLY THE WORLD LEADERS, MANY

04:34.000 --> 04:35.266
OF WHOM MADE SOME BIG PROMISES,

04:35.333 --> 04:36.633
LIKE CUTTING BACK ON COAL AND

04:36.700 --> 04:37.933
METHANE EMISSIONS AND COMMITTING

04:38.000 --> 04:38.800
TO ENDING DEFORESTATION.

04:38.866 --> 04:39.700
AND CUMULATIVELY, THOSE PROMISES

04:39.766 --> 04:41.266
COULD HAVE SOME EFFECT.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.233
>> THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY

04:42.300 --> 04:45.033
AGENCY SAYS IF ALL THE PLEDGES

04:45.100 --> 04:45.733
FROM COP26 ARE FULFILLED AS

04:45.800 --> 04:47.566
PROMISED AND ON SCHEDULE,

04:47.633 --> 04:49.133
GLOBAL WARMING CAN BE LIMITED TO

04:49.200 --> 04:55.366
1.8 DEGREES.

04:55.433 --> 04:59.233
>> John: RIGHT, 1.8 DEGREES.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.600
WHICH SOUNDS OKAY, UNTIL YOU

05:00.666 --> 05:01.566
REMEMBER THE SCIENTIFIC

05:01.633 --> 05:02.233
CONSENSUS IS THAT THE RISE NEEDS

05:02.300 --> 05:03.066
TO BE LIMITED TO 1.5 DEGREES,

05:03.133 --> 05:04.233
AND BEYOND THAT THRESHOLD,

05:04.300 --> 05:06.000
THERE'S A FAR GREATER LIKELIHOOD

05:06.066 --> 05:11.200
OF DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES.

05:11.266 --> 05:12.500
AND IT ACTUALLY GETS WORSE,

05:12.566 --> 05:13.100
BECAUSE THAT ALREADY

05:13.166 --> 05:14.066
INSUFFICIENT TARGET IS

05:14.133 --> 05:14.866
PREDICATED ON EVERY SINGLE

05:14.933 --> 05:15.633
COUNTRY LIVING UP TO ITS

05:15.700 --> 05:16.900
PLEDGES, WHICH SEEMS VERY

05:16.966 --> 05:17.500
UNLIKELY, BECAUSE THEIR TRACK

05:17.566 --> 05:19.300
RECORD ISN'T GREAT HERE.

05:19.366 --> 05:21.000
AT THE COP15 CONFERENCE 12 YEARS

05:21.066 --> 05:22.466
AGO, RICH NATIONS PROMISED TO

05:22.533 --> 05:23.900
CHANNEL $100 BILLION A YEAR TO

05:23.966 --> 05:25.233
LESS WEALTHY NATIONS BY 2020 TO

05:25.300 --> 05:26.533
HELP THEM ADAPT TO CLIMATE

05:26.600 --> 05:33.366
CHANGE.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.400
BUT THEY ARE NOWHERE CLOSE TO

05:34.466 --> 05:35.000
THAT.

05:35.066 --> 05:35.833
AND LOOK, THERE ARE THINGS IT'S

05:35.900 --> 05:36.466
OKAY TO TAKE A DECADE ON

05:36.533 --> 05:37.633
AND NOT DELIVER --

05:37.700 --> 05:38.833
THE "AVATAR" SEQUELS,

05:38.900 --> 05:39.666
FOR INSTANCE.

05:39.733 --> 05:40.766
TAKE YOUR TIME ON THOSE,

05:40.833 --> 05:42.666
JAMES CAMERON.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.233
NO ONE GIVES A SHIT.

05:45.300 --> 05:45.900
I WILL GIVE ANYONE IN THIS

05:45.966 --> 05:46.533
AUDIENCE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF

05:46.600 --> 05:47.366
THEY REMEMBER EITHER OF THESE

05:47.433 --> 05:49.166
CHARACTERS' NAMES.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.200
EXACTLY.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.933
AID TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE,

05:52.000 --> 05:52.933
THOUGH, IS SOMETHING PEOPLE

05:53.000 --> 05:55.100
ACTUALLY NEED.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.433
THE TRUTH IS, WHILE WORLD

05:56.500 --> 05:57.033
LEADERS MAY BE LOUDLY PATTING

05:57.100 --> 05:57.600
THEMSELVES ON THE BACK FOR

05:57.666 --> 06:00.433
PLEDGING A BETTER FUTURE THIS

06:00.500 --> 06:02.033
WEEK, THE LAST DECADE OF BROKEN

06:02.100 --> 06:02.633
PROMISES SHOULD SERVE AS A

06:02.700 --> 06:03.533
WARNING THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP

06:03.600 --> 06:04.766
PUSHING THEM.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.733
BECAUSE THIS NEXT DECADE IS IT.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.100
EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE --

06:09.166 --> 06:11.100
YOUR LIFE, MINE, THOSE SADISTIC

06:11.166 --> 06:12.233
POLAR BEARS'.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.000
ALL OF IT.

06:14.066 --> 06:15.500
AND WE ALL NEED TO TAKE AN

06:15.566 --> 06:17.633
ACTIVE ROLE IN WAKING WORLD

06:17.700 --> 06:18.833
LEADERS UP -- FIGURATIVELY AND

06:18.900 --> 06:20.366
SADLY, IN ONE CASE, LITERALLY.

06:20.433 --> 06:25.000
AND NOW, THIS.

06:25.066 --> 06:26.666
>> Announcer: AND NOW, PEOPLE ON

06:26.733 --> 06:29.133
TV SAYING THINGS WRONG.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.566
>> DR. RODRIGUEZ IS A

06:30.633 --> 06:33.400
BOARD-CERTIFIED INTERNIST AND A

06:33.466 --> 06:34.800

06:34.866 --> 06:36.600
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

06:36.666 --> 06:38.766
A VIROLOGIST.

06:38.833 --> 06:39.400
>> NOW LISTEN TO TAYLOR SWIFT'S

CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?

06:50.366 --> 06:50.600
"FORKLORE."

06:50.666 --> 06:51.900
AM I SAYING THAT CORRECTLY?

AM I SAYING?

06:59.766 --> 07:03.233
>> YOU SAID THAT RIGHT.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.100
>> THE DIRECTOR OF WORKERS FOR

OPPORTUNITY AT THE

07:07.533 --> 07:10.033
MACK-A-KNACK CENTER.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.800
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

07:11.866 --> 07:14.500
>> MACKINAC, BUT THANK YOU

07:14.566 --> 07:17.600
FOR HAVING ME.

07:17.666 --> 07:20.400

07:22.066 --> 07:22.766
>> HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF BANKSY?

07:22.833 --> 07:23.866
>> HE PAINTED THAT ONE THING ON

07:23.933 --> 07:26.166
THE WALLS AND STUFF.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.933
OKAY, BANKE --

07:29.000 --> 07:30.433
>> BANKSY.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.633
[LAUGHTER]

07:32.700 --> 07:33.533
>> AT AN AUCTION IN LONDON.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.400
BANKSKY.

07:36.466 --> 07:38.666
BANKE?

07:38.733 --> 07:40.333
>> MOVING ON.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.200
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:42.266 --> 07:42.500
ELECTRICITY.

07:42.566 --> 07:43.366
IT'S LIKE OSCAR ISAAC, IN THAT

07:43.433 --> 07:44.000
WITHOUT ITS INVOLVEMENT, NOTHING

07:44.066 --> 07:45.233
IN MY HOUSE GETS TURNED ON.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.600
ELECTRICITY IS SUCH AN INTEGRAL

07:46.666 --> 07:48.333
PART OF MODERN LIFE, IT'S HARD

07:48.400 --> 07:49.733
TO BELIEVE THAT WE USED TO HAVE

07:49.800 --> 07:50.633
TO SELL PEOPLE ON THE IDEA OF

07:50.700 --> 07:51.766
ELECTRIC APPLIANCES WITH ADS

07:51.833 --> 07:53.200
LIKE THIS.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.333
>> WHEN YOU STEP INSIDE THE

07:55.400 --> 07:57.333
TOTAL ELECTRIC HOME YOU STEP

07:57.400 --> 07:58.066
INTO AN ENTIRELY NEW CONCEPT IN

07:58.133 --> 08:00.466
LIVING ORGANIZED AROUND ELECTRIC

08:00.533 --> 08:01.833
CENTERS SUCH AS THIS

08:01.900 --> 08:09.466
ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.

08:09.533 --> 08:10.366
THE PRIDE AND JOY OF THE MAN OF

08:10.433 --> 08:11.100
THE HOUSE IS THE WEATHER CONTROL

08:11.166 --> 08:12.433
CENTER, A CENTER THAT PUTS YOU

08:12.500 --> 08:14.033
IN CHARGE OF THE ELECTRIC

08:14.100 --> 08:14.666
HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING AND

08:14.733 --> 08:15.300
THE ELECTRONIC AIR FILTERING OF

08:15.366 --> 08:24.633
THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.333
>> John: "YES, THE PRIDE AND JOY

08:25.400 --> 08:26.466
OF THE MAN OF THE HOUSE IS, OF

08:26.533 --> 08:27.100
COURSE, THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL

08:27.166 --> 08:27.533
SYSTEM.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.433
JUST INVITE ALL YOUR THERMO-BROS

08:28.500 --> 08:29.033
OVER ON A SUNDAY, CRACK OPEN A

08:29.100 --> 08:29.533
FEW BREWS, AND WATCH THE

08:29.600 --> 08:30.400
TEMPERATURE FOR HOURS.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.000
SORRY, LADIES -- YOU WOULDN'T

08:31.066 --> 08:31.800
UNDERSTAND.

08:31.866 --> 08:34.133
IT'S A GUY THING."

08:34.200 --> 08:35.566
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

08:35.633 --> 08:36.866
TALK ABOUT THE POWER GRID -- THE

08:36.933 --> 08:38.200
SYSTEM OF GENERATORS THAT

08:38.266 --> 08:39.833
PRODUCE ELECTRICITY, AND THE

08:39.900 --> 08:41.566
VAST LATTICEWORK OF WIRES THAT

08:41.633 --> 08:42.666
GET IT TO OUR HOMES.

08:42.733 --> 08:43.800
THE GRID IS SOMETHING YOU

08:43.866 --> 08:45.200
PROBABLY DON'T THINK ABOUT UNTIL

08:45.266 --> 08:47.366
IT GOES DOWN -- WHICH

08:47.433 --> 08:48.500
UNFORTUNATELY, HAS BEEN

08:48.566 --> 08:49.733
HAPPENING MORE AND MORE IN

08:49.800 --> 08:50.666
RECENT YEARS.

08:50.733 --> 08:52.000
>> MILLIONS OF TEXANS WOKE UP TO

08:52.066 --> 08:53.133
COLD HOMES WHEN THE POWER GRID

08:53.200 --> 08:55.566
FAILED.

08:55.633 --> 08:56.566
>> THIS VIDEO SHOWS LIGHTS GOING

08:56.633 --> 08:57.400
OUT AS PARTS OF THE POWER GRID

08:57.466 --> 09:00.733
FAILED.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.866
>> AND THAT POWER GRID FAILED

09:01.933 --> 09:02.433
YESTERDAY WHEN HURRICANE IDA

09:02.500 --> 09:03.533
RAVAGED PARTS OF LOUISIANA.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.300
>> THE LIGHTS WENT OUT ACROSS

09:05.366 --> 09:06.633
DOWNTOWN DETROIT, CUTTING POWER

09:06.700 --> 09:08.633
TO 1,400 BUILDINGS.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.933
WATCH AS THE LIGHTS GO OUT

09:10.000 --> 09:10.733
DURING A MURDER TRIAL, THESE

09:10.800 --> 09:13.166
LAWYERS LEFT IN THE DARK.

09:13.233 --> 09:14.500
>> John: HOLY SHIT!

09:14.566 --> 09:16.500
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT DURING A

09:16.566 --> 09:18.600
MURDER TRIAL, ONE OF TWO THINGS

09:18.666 --> 09:20.733
IS HAPPENING: YOU'VE EITHER GOT

09:20.800 --> 09:21.833
A POWER GRID DEEPLY IN NEED OF

09:21.900 --> 09:23.333
REPAIR OR THE MURDER VICTIM HAS

09:23.400 --> 09:24.666
COME BACK AS A GHOST AND IS

09:24.733 --> 09:26.300
SEEKING REVENGE.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.333
EITHER WAY, YOUR PRIORITIES HAVE

09:27.400 --> 09:28.466
SHIFTED AND IT'S TIME TO FOCUS

09:28.533 --> 09:31.333
ON A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.566
IF IT FEELS LIKE THERE'VE BEEN

09:32.633 --> 09:33.800
MORE OUTAGES THAN USUAL

09:33.866 --> 09:34.933
RECENTLY, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE

09:35.000 --> 09:36.933
HAVE.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.533
BY ONE ESTIMATE, FROM 2015 TO

09:38.600 --> 09:39.433
2020 THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL

09:39.500 --> 09:42.033
BLACKOUTS IN THE U.S. DOUBLED.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.000
THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR NUMEROUS

09:44.066 --> 09:45.600
REASONS -- THE MOST OBVIOUS

09:45.666 --> 09:46.900
BEING, SITTING AROUND WITHOUT

09:46.966 --> 09:49.466
POWER FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME

09:49.533 --> 09:50.700
ABSOLUTELY SUCKS.

09:50.766 --> 09:51.633
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO

09:51.700 --> 09:53.233
WITHOUT TV AND THE INTERNET?

09:53.300 --> 09:54.933
GO OUTSIDE?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.333
THAT'S WHERE SNAKES LIVE, YOU

09:56.400 --> 09:57.700
IDIOT!

09:57.766 --> 09:59.066
SO WHAT ELSE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO

09:59.133 --> 10:00.500
DO -- READ A BOOK?

10:00.566 --> 10:02.466
THAT'S WHERE SNAKES SLEEP, YOU

10:02.533 --> 10:03.500
IDIOT!

10:03.566 --> 10:04.400
WHY DO YOU THINK WE INVENTED

10:04.466 --> 10:06.500
KINDLES?

10:06.566 --> 10:08.200
BUT IT'S NOT JUST INCONVENIENCE.

10:08.266 --> 10:09.100
LOSING ELECTRICITY WREAKS

10:09.166 --> 10:10.666
HAVOC ON EVERYTHING FROM SEWAGE

10:10.733 --> 10:12.400
TREATMENT PLANTS TO WATER

10:12.466 --> 10:14.166
PURIFICATION SYSTEMS, AND CAN BE

10:14.233 --> 10:15.366
LIFE-THREATENING TO PEOPLE WHO

10:15.433 --> 10:16.933
RELY ON MEDICAL EQUIPMENT LIKE

10:17.000 --> 10:17.933
VENTILATORS AND POWERED

10:18.000 --> 10:19.866
WHEELCHAIRS.

10:19.933 --> 10:20.800
>> IT'S TRAUMATIZING, IT'S

10:20.866 --> 10:22.100
TERRIFYING.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.200
>> FOR TERHORST, AN OUTAGE IS

10:23.266 --> 10:26.133
MORE THAN JUST AN EXPENSIVE

10:26.200 --> 10:26.466
INCONVENIENCE.

10:26.533 --> 10:27.500
>> THIS ISN'T LIKE, "I'M GOING

10:27.566 --> 10:30.833
TO LOSE A CASSEROLE IN MY

10:30.900 --> 10:33.400
FRIDGE," YOU KNOW?

10:33.466 --> 10:34.733
THIS IS, "I MAY NOT BE ALIVE

10:34.800 --> 10:40.433
TOMORROW."

10:40.500 --> 10:41.833
>> John: RIGHT, EXACTLY.

10:41.900 --> 10:42.533
THIS IS ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN

10:42.600 --> 10:43.433
JUST LOST CASSEROLES ESPECIALLY

10:43.500 --> 10:47.733
BECAUSE, LET'S BE HONEST HERE,

10:47.800 --> 10:48.700
ALL CASSEROLES ARE SHIT.

10:48.766 --> 10:49.300
THEY DON'T RELY ON SPECIFIC

10:49.366 --> 10:50.200
INGREDIENTS SO MUCH AS ON

10:50.266 --> 10:51.233
"WHATEVER'S IN SOMEONE'S HOUSE."

10:51.300 --> 10:53.200
CASSEROLES ARE A SAD SMORGASBORD

10:53.266 --> 10:54.533
OF OTHER LEFTOVERS DESPERATELY

10:54.600 --> 10:55.433
COBBLED TOGETHER TO MAKE A

10:55.500 --> 10:56.533
PATHETIC ALMOST MEAL WITH NAMES

10:56.600 --> 10:57.966
LIKE "TUNA SURPRISE" AND

10:58.033 --> 11:02.100
"CHICKEN I'M SORRY."

11:02.166 --> 11:03.000
BUT TO HAVE A CASSEROLE

11:03.066 --> 11:03.500
LEFTOVER?

11:03.566 --> 11:04.466
THAT'S ABANDONED FOOD THAT

11:04.533 --> 11:05.766
DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT TWO ROUNDS

11:05.833 --> 11:07.100
IN A ROW.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.766
I'M SORRY, BUT IF THAT IS YOUR

11:08.833 --> 11:09.833
ONLY OPTION, THERE ARE WORSE

11:09.900 --> 11:12.066
FATES THAN BEING DEAD.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.466
AND WHILE THINGS ARE RIGHT BAD

11:15.533 --> 11:17.000
NOW, THEY COULD GET A LOT WORSE

11:17.066 --> 11:17.900
IN THE FUTURE, BECAUSE THE U.S.

11:17.966 --> 11:19.600
HAS A GOAL OF NET-ZERO CARBON

11:19.666 --> 11:21.066
EMISSIONS BY 2050 -- WHICH WE

11:21.133 --> 11:24.033
MUST ABSOLUTELY MUST MEET -- BUT

11:24.100 --> 11:25.900
ONE STUDY ESTIMATES THAT'S GOING

11:25.966 --> 11:27.333
TO REQUIRE A 40% TO 60% INCREASE

11:27.400 --> 11:29.633
IN PEAK ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.733
WHICH, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

11:30.800 --> 11:31.633
DOES MAKE SENSE -- IF

11:31.700 --> 11:34.100
WE'RE SWITCHING TO ELECTRIC

11:34.166 --> 11:37.700
CARS, COOKING, AND HEATING, ALL

11:37.766 --> 11:38.266
THAT ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO

11:38.333 --> 11:38.866
HAVE TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE.

11:38.933 --> 11:40.733
AND THE TRUTH IS, IF EVERYONE

11:40.800 --> 11:41.866
SUDDENLY HAD AN ELECTRIC CAR

11:41.933 --> 11:46.333
TOMORROW, THAT MIGHT BE GREAT

11:46.400 --> 11:47.800
FOR THE PLANET BUT IT COULD PUSH

11:47.866 --> 11:48.900
OUR GRID TO THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT.

11:48.966 --> 11:50.500
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

11:50.566 --> 11:51.100
POWER GRID, THE CURRENT STATE

11:51.166 --> 11:51.966
THAT IT'S IN, AND WHAT WE CAN DO

11:52.033 --> 11:53.000
TO FIX IT.

11:53.066 --> 11:54.533
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

11:54.600 --> 11:55.533
THAT WHILE I'M SAYING "GRID,"

11:55.600 --> 11:57.800
SINGULAR, OUR SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY

11:57.866 --> 12:00.466
MADE UP OF THREE GRIDS.

12:00.533 --> 12:00.900
THERE'S THE EASTERN

12:00.966 --> 12:01.900
INTERCONNECTION, THE WESTERN

12:01.966 --> 12:02.900
INTERCONNECTION, AND THE TEXAS

12:02.966 --> 12:05.333
INTERCONNECTION.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.600
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE MAJOR LEAGUE

12:07.666 --> 12:08.866
BASEBALL, IN THAT THERE ARE TWO

12:08.933 --> 12:09.366
DOMINANT GROUPS AND THEN

12:09.433 --> 12:10.000
ASSHOLES IN TEXAS WHO'D RATHER

12:10.066 --> 12:12.333
MAKE UP THEIR OWN RULES.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.833
AND IT ALL STARTED IN 1882,

12:13.900 --> 12:15.866
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK, WHEN

12:15.933 --> 12:18.500
THOMAS EDISON UNVEILED THE

12:18.566 --> 12:19.633
COUNTRY'S FIRST CENTRAL POWER

12:19.700 --> 12:22.300
STATION ON PEARL STREET.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.700
INTERESTINGLY, IT WAS

12:23.766 --> 12:25.566
THEN-EDISON'S-SOMETIME RIVAL,

12:25.633 --> 12:26.600
NIKOLA TESLA, WHO HELPED DEVELOP

12:26.666 --> 12:28.133
THE TECHNOLOGY ENABLING

12:28.200 --> 12:29.533
ELECTRICITY TO TRAVEL FOR LONG

12:29.600 --> 12:30.500
DISTANCES.

12:30.566 --> 12:31.533
SOMETHING ALL THE MORE

12:31.600 --> 12:33.200
REMARKABLE, GIVEN TESLA'S --

12:33.266 --> 12:45.600
LET'S SAY ECCENTRICITIES.

12:45.666 --> 12:46.466
>> TESLA SUFFERED FROM BIZARRE

12:46.533 --> 12:47.600
COMPULSIONS LIKE HIS CONSUMING

12:47.666 --> 12:48.466
NEED TO RESCUE INJURED PIGEONS

12:48.533 --> 12:49.166
AND NURSE THEM BACK TO HEALTH.

12:49.233 --> 12:50.233
>> HE HAS AN INFIRMARY FOR THEM

12:50.300 --> 12:50.900
RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS BEDROOM WINDOW

12:50.966 --> 12:51.766
WHERE HE'S TRYING TO HEAL, YOU

12:51.833 --> 12:52.466
KNOW, SOME MIGHT HAVE BROKEN

12:52.533 --> 12:53.033
WINGS, BROKEN LEGS.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.033
AND IN FACT, AT ONE POINT, HE

12:54.100 --> 12:54.733
ACTUALLY REFERRED TO ONE BIRD AS

12:54.800 --> 12:55.633
HIS WIFE.

12:55.700 --> 12:56.600
AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE

12:56.666 --> 12:57.566
DIED, THE INVENTIVE SPIRIT LEFT

12:57.633 --> 13:03.366
HIM.

13:03.433 --> 13:04.333
>> John: OH, DID IT, NOW?

13:04.400 --> 13:05.533
LOOK, THIS ISN'T THE POINT OF

13:05.600 --> 13:06.500
THIS STORY, OR ANYTHING, REALLY,

13:06.566 --> 13:08.066
BUT IF TESLA WERE ALIVE TODAY I

13:08.133 --> 13:08.633
GENUINELY WONDER WHICH WOULD

13:08.700 --> 13:09.466
UPSET HIM MORE, THE FACT THAT

13:09.533 --> 13:10.966
HIS NAME'S BEEN CO-OPTED BY

13:11.033 --> 13:12.033
HISTORY'S FIRST EDGELORD

13:12.100 --> 13:13.633
BILLIONAIRE OR THE FACT THAT

13:13.700 --> 13:15.200
MODERN PIGEONS HAVE GOTTEN SO

13:15.266 --> 13:17.600
UNFUCKABLE.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.566
LISTEN, I SAID NO.

13:18.633 --> 13:19.400
RESPECTFULLY, THANK YOU FOR THE

13:19.466 --> 13:20.533
ATTENTION, BUT I AM NOT

13:20.600 --> 13:21.500
INTERESTED, PLEASE LEAVE ME AND

13:21.566 --> 13:24.366
MY FRIENDS ALONE.

13:24.433 --> 13:25.633
AND WHEN IT WAS BUILT, OUR POWER

13:25.700 --> 13:26.833
GRID WASN'T JUST A TECHNICAL

13:26.900 --> 13:28.800
MARVEL -- IT WAS A CIVIC ONE.

13:28.866 --> 13:30.766
UNTIL THE 1930s, ELECTRICITY

13:30.833 --> 13:31.733
WAS A LUXURY MAINLY FOR DENSE

13:31.800 --> 13:33.900
URBAN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.

13:33.966 --> 13:35.666
BUT AFTER FDR CREATED THE RURAL

13:35.733 --> 13:37.800
ELECTRIFICATION ADMINISTRATION

13:37.866 --> 13:39.300
IN 1935, THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE.

13:39.366 --> 13:42.166
>> THE REA WAS SET UP BY THE

13:42.233 --> 13:43.600
PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS IN

13:43.666 --> 13:45.933
1935 TO HELP FARMERS TO GET THE

13:46.000 --> 13:49.800
POWER AND THE LIGHT AT A PRICE

13:49.866 --> 13:50.933
THEY CAN AFFORD.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.466
HERE IS THE FIRST THING WOMEN

13:55.533 --> 13:58.233
ASK FOR AFTER LIGHT ITSELF.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.266
IF YOU HAVE EVER IRONED FOR AN

13:59.333 --> 14:01.266
HOUR, YOU'LL KNOW WHY.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.166
AN ELECTRIC IRON MAY NOT LOOK

14:02.233 --> 14:03.000
IMPORTANT TO A MAN, BUT IT

14:03.066 --> 14:03.866
LIGHTENS ONE WHOLE DAY'S BURDEN

14:03.933 --> 14:07.300
FOR A WOMAN.

14:07.366 --> 14:08.733
>> John: "YES, DON'T WORRY,

14:08.800 --> 14:10.933
LADIES, WITH HUBBY NATURALLY

14:11.000 --> 14:11.966
BUSY STARING AT THE THERMOSTAT,

14:12.033 --> 14:12.766
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY TO DO TO

14:12.833 --> 14:13.966
OCCUPY YOUR TIME, LIKE IRONING

14:14.033 --> 14:16.333
HIS CLOTHES, OR TEACHING A

14:16.400 --> 14:17.566
DIFFERENT WOMAN TO IRON HIS

14:17.633 --> 14:18.833
CLOTHES AND, IF THERE'S STILL

14:18.900 --> 14:21.333
TIME, PRESSING THE IRON TO YOUR

14:21.400 --> 14:23.266
NECK JUST FOR A MOMENT, SIMPLY

14:23.333 --> 14:24.766
TO FEEL SOMETHING.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.200
YOU THOUGHT GETTING LIGHTS WOULD

14:26.266 --> 14:26.833
MAKE THINGS BETTER, BUT IT ONLY

14:26.900 --> 14:28.233
MADE THINGS CLEARER, DIDN'T IT?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.466
DIDN'T IT?"

14:30.533 --> 14:32.700
IN THE END, WE WOUND UP WITH

14:32.766 --> 14:35.000
600,000 MILES OF TRANSMISSION

14:35.066 --> 14:36.900
LINES AND AROUND 5.5 MILLION

14:36.966 --> 14:38.200
MILES OF LOCAL DISTRIBUTION

14:38.266 --> 14:39.700
LINES, LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU

14:39.766 --> 14:41.133
MIGHT SEE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE,

14:41.200 --> 14:41.833
ALL OF WHICH FORM OUR MODERN

14:41.900 --> 14:45.300
ELECTRICAL GRID.

14:45.366 --> 14:46.766
IT'S BEEN CALLED "THE SUPREME

14:46.833 --> 14:48.000
ENGINEERING ACHIEVEMENT OF THE

14:48.066 --> 14:50.800
20TH CENTURY."

14:50.866 --> 14:52.333
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT IS

14:52.400 --> 14:52.833
COMPLETELY INVULNERABLE.

14:52.900 --> 14:53.233
OF COURSE NOT.

14:53.300 --> 14:53.933
WHEN YOU STRING WIRES IN THE

14:54.000 --> 14:54.900
AIR, THEY'RE SUBJECT TO

14:54.966 --> 14:56.466
INTERFERENCE FROM ALL SORTS OF

14:56.533 --> 15:02.500
THINGS.

15:02.566 --> 15:03.333
A WEBSITE THAT TRACKED

15:03.400 --> 15:04.233
DISRUPTIONS FOUND THAT THERE'VE

15:04.300 --> 15:05.300
BEEN OVER 600 OUTAGES CAUSED BY

15:05.366 --> 15:06.566
SQUIRRELS, OVER 200 BY BIRDS, 53

15:06.633 --> 15:07.600
BY RACCOONS, AND A NUMBER OF

15:07.666 --> 15:08.566
OTHERS CAUSED BY EVERYTHING FROM

15:08.633 --> 15:09.566
SNAKES TO SLUGS.

15:09.633 --> 15:10.766
AND LET ME JUST QUICKLY SAY

15:10.833 --> 15:12.900
HERE, KUDOS, SLUGS.

15:12.966 --> 15:13.900
OUT OF EVERYTHING ON THAT LIST,

15:13.966 --> 15:14.800
YOU'RE THE ONES I

15:14.866 --> 15:17.866
UNDERESTIMATED.

15:17.933 --> 15:19.000
THE NICEST THING I CAN SAY ABOUT

15:19.066 --> 15:20.566
YOU IS THAT ON YOUR BEST DAY YOU

15:20.633 --> 15:22.166
LOOK LIKE SASSY POOP -- BUT YOU

15:22.233 --> 15:23.600
REALLY SHOWED US SOMETHING BY

15:23.666 --> 15:24.500
DISRUPTING OUR POWER.

15:24.566 --> 15:26.066
SO ONCE MORE, SLUGS --

15:26.133 --> 15:27.966
KUDOS.

15:28.033 --> 15:29.333
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ANIMALS THAT

15:29.400 --> 15:35.700
CAN WREAK HAVOC.

15:35.766 --> 15:36.800
THERE'VE ALSO BEEN MULTIPLE

15:36.866 --> 15:37.433
BALLOON-BASED DISRUPTIONS, AND

15:37.500 --> 15:38.100
IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW ON EARTH

15:38.166 --> 15:38.700
A BALLOON COULD CAUSE A POWER

15:38.766 --> 15:47.866
OUTAGE, THE ANSWER IS LIKE THIS:

15:47.933 --> 15:48.733
>> OH, SHIT!

15:48.800 --> 15:49.300
OH!

15:49.366 --> 15:50.433
>> [LAUGHS]

15:50.500 --> 15:52.633
[EXPLOSION]

15:52.700 --> 15:53.700
>> John: EXCELLENT.

15:53.766 --> 15:54.766
NOT ONE SINGLE NOTE.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.233
I HOPE NO ONE STANDING THERE WAS

15:56.300 --> 15:57.400
HURT, BUT HONESTLY, EVEN IF

15:57.466 --> 15:58.666
SOMEONE WAS, IT WOULDN'T BE A

15:58.733 --> 16:02.533
DEALBREAKER FOR ME.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.166
BUT DISRUPTIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

16:03.233 --> 16:04.666
AN ISSUE FOR THE POWER GRID.

16:04.733 --> 16:06.333
WHAT MAKES IT ESPECIALLY

16:06.400 --> 16:07.200
VULNERABLE NOW IS A COMBINATION

16:07.266 --> 16:09.933
OF TWO KEY FACTORS.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.266
THE FIRST IS OLD AGE.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.633
MOST POWER LINES WERE

16:12.700 --> 16:13.833
CONSTRUCTED IN THE '50s AND

16:13.900 --> 16:15.600
'60s WITH A 50-YEAR

16:15.666 --> 16:17.800
LIFE EXPECTANCY, WHICH THEY'RE

16:17.866 --> 16:18.833
CLEARLY NOW WELL PAST.

16:18.900 --> 16:19.700
AND THE SECOND IS

16:19.766 --> 16:20.800
CLIMATE CHANGE, MEANING

16:20.866 --> 16:21.633
THERE'S NOW MORE

16:21.700 --> 16:23.000
DANGER POSED BY EXTREME WEATHER,

16:23.066 --> 16:24.733
LIKE HURRICANES, TORNADOES, AND

16:24.800 --> 16:25.366
ABNORMALLY HOT OR COLD

16:25.433 --> 16:27.100
TEMPERATURES.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.766
AND THAT COMBO OF OLD EQUIPMENT

16:28.833 --> 16:32.833
AND NEW CLIMATE THREATS HAS BEEN

16:32.900 --> 16:33.166
DISASTROUS.

16:33.233 --> 16:33.900
THE MASSIVE CAMPFIRE IN

16:33.966 --> 16:35.033
CALIFORNIA A FEW YEARS

16:35.100 --> 16:36.333
AGO HAPPENED BECAUSE THERE WAS A

16:36.400 --> 16:37.966
DROUGHT IN THE AREA, MAKING IT

16:38.033 --> 16:39.633
ESSENTIALLY A TINDERBOX.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.066
AND IN INTENSE WINDS, SOME

16:41.133 --> 16:43.100
PACIFIC GAS & ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT

16:43.166 --> 16:44.800
FAILED, AND FOR A PRETTY

16:44.866 --> 16:46.733
INFURIATING REASON.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.600
>> THIS IS THE HOOK THAT KILLED

16:50.666 --> 16:55.733
84 PEOPLE.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.433
>> THAT GROOVE TOOK ABOUT

16:57.500 --> 17:02.166
98 YEARS TO WEAR IN.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.866
IT'S NOT A DEFECT.

17:03.933 --> 17:05.466
THESE HOOKS ARE WHAT ARE HOLDING

17:05.533 --> 17:06.800
THE ELECTRICAL LINES OFF THE

17:06.866 --> 17:08.366
GROUND, AND PG&E'S DECISION WAS

17:08.433 --> 17:09.666
SIMPLY JUST TO LET THESE THINGS

17:09.733 --> 17:12.833
HANG UNTIL THEY BROKE.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.533
>> WHEN THIS OLD HOOK DID BREAK,

17:14.600 --> 17:15.666
THE POWER LINE MADE CONTACT WITH

17:15.733 --> 17:17.133
THE METAL TOWER, SHOWERING THE

17:17.200 --> 17:18.533
GROUND IN SPARKS.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.133
THAT'S HOW PG&E STARTED THE

17:20.200 --> 17:23.366
CAMPFIRE.

17:23.433 --> 17:27.866
>> Joh YEAH.

17:27.933 --> 17:29.200
AND LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU.

17:29.266 --> 17:32.933
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP SOMETHING

17:33.000 --> 17:33.800
TO KEEP WORKING FOREVER.

17:33.866 --> 17:34.866
PG&E BASICALLY TOOK THE SAME

17:34.933 --> 17:35.433
APPROACH TO THEIR EQUIPMENT

17:35.500 --> 17:36.433
AS DEMOCRATS DID WITH

17:36.500 --> 17:39.133
RUTH BADER GINSBURG.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.700
AND IN BOTH CASES, IT DIDN'T END

17:40.766 --> 17:40.900
WELL.

17:40.966 --> 17:41.533
SO BASICALLY, WE'VE GOT A

17:41.600 --> 17:43.566
POWER GRID BUILT IN THE

17:43.633 --> 17:44.866
20TH CENTURY THAT'S NOT EQUIPPED

17:44.933 --> 17:45.733
TO DEAL WITH THE NEEDS AND

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
STRESSES OF THE 21ST.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.133
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

17:48.200 --> 17:51.933
OKAY, LET'S UPGRADE IT THEN."

17:52.000 --> 17:52.900
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

17:52.966 --> 17:54.033
BUT THAT'S ALSO A MASSIVE

17:54.100 --> 17:55.000
UNDERTAKING.

17:55.066 --> 17:56.700
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

17:56.766 --> 17:57.833
FIXES, BOTH SMALL AND HUGE, THAT

17:57.900 --> 17:59.033
THE POWER GRID BADLY NEEDS.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.633
THE SMALL ONES, WE DON'T HAVE

18:00.700 --> 18:01.333
TIME TO GET INTO TONIGHT -- LIKE

18:01.400 --> 18:04.600
INVESTING IN MICROGRIDS AND

18:04.666 --> 18:05.566
WEATHERPROOFING, AS WELL AS

18:05.633 --> 18:06.866
BETTER STORAGE CAPABILITIES, SO

18:06.933 --> 18:08.533
EXCESS POWER WE GENERATE DOESN'T

18:08.600 --> 18:09.533
GO TO WASTE.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.033
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE

18:11.100 --> 18:12.833
HUGE ONE HERE.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.266
BECAUSE OUR SHIFT TO RENEWABLE

18:14.333 --> 18:15.233
ENERGY IS GOING TO REQUIRE A

18:15.300 --> 18:16.233
FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN WHAT OUR

18:16.300 --> 18:19.633
GRID LOOKS LIKE.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.633
ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF

18:20.700 --> 18:22.300
FOSSIL-FUEL PLANTS IS THAT YOU

18:22.366 --> 18:23.500
CAN PUT THEM ANYWHERE -- THAT'S

18:23.566 --> 18:24.666
WHY MOST ARE LOCATED NEAR

18:24.733 --> 18:25.800
DENSELY POPULATED AREAS, CLOSE

18:25.866 --> 18:27.633
TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.633
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST REPLACE EVERY

18:30.700 --> 18:32.933
COAL PLANT WITH A WIND FARM,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.233
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY

18:34.300 --> 18:35.233
WHERE THE WIND IS STRONGEST, AND

18:35.300 --> 18:37.733
THAT FACT ALONE CHANGES

18:37.800 --> 18:39.333
EVERYTHING.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.566
>> THIS IS A MODEL CREATED BY

18:40.633 --> 18:41.966
PRINCETON, MAPPING OUT POSSIBLE

18:42.033 --> 18:43.100
PLACES IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S.

18:43.166 --> 18:47.233
WHERE WIND AND SOLAR PROJECTS

18:47.300 --> 18:48.300
COULD, IN THEORY, BE BUILT.

18:48.366 --> 18:49.666
ASIDE FROM SOME OFFSHORE WIND

18:49.733 --> 18:52.400
FARMS, IT'S MOSTLY IN THE MIDDLE

18:52.466 --> 18:53.566
OF THE U.S.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.566
ANOTHER STUDY FOUND THAT THESE

18:54.633 --> 18:55.666
STATES HAVE MOST OF THE WIND AND

18:55.733 --> 18:57.700
SOLAR POTENTIAL, YET THE PEOPLE

18:57.766 --> 18:58.333
LIVING THERE WOULD ONLY MAKE UP

18:58.400 --> 19:02.900
30% OF THE ELECTRICITY DEMAND.

19:02.966 --> 19:04.200
IN A DECARBONIZED FUTURE, WE'RE

19:04.266 --> 19:05.566
GOING TO NEED TO GET ELECTRICITY

19:05.633 --> 19:11.633
FROM HERE TO HERE.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.566
>> John: RIGHT, AND YOU PROBABLY

19:12.633 --> 19:14.166
DON'T EVEN NEED ME TO TELL YOU

19:14.233 --> 19:16.633
WHY THIS IS GOING TO BE AN

19:16.700 --> 19:17.633
UPHILL BATTLE, BECAUSE AS SOON

19:17.700 --> 19:18.766
AS YOU SAW THAT GRAPHIC AND

19:18.833 --> 19:19.333
REALIZED UPDATING THE GRID

19:19.400 --> 19:20.666
WAS GOING TO REQUIRE A

19:20.733 --> 19:21.233
PRINCETON RESEARCHER TELLING

19:21.300 --> 19:21.866
A MIDWESTERN FARMER, "WE NEED TO

19:21.933 --> 19:24.333
BUILD SOMETHING IN YOUR BACKYARD

19:24.400 --> 19:25.466
SO SOMEONE IN CALIFORNIA CAN

19:25.533 --> 19:26.633
POWER THEIR ELECTRIC CAR," YOU

19:26.700 --> 19:27.833
ALREADY CALLED THE NEXT EIGHT

19:27.900 --> 19:31.566
ELECTION CYCLES FOR REPUBLICANS.

19:31.633 --> 19:33.433
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME GOOD

19:33.500 --> 19:34.066
NEWS HERE, BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY

19:34.133 --> 19:34.966
MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN

19:35.033 --> 19:36.100
BUILDING OUT RENEWABLE ENERGY

19:36.166 --> 19:37.433
POWER SOURCES.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.066
LAST YEAR, FOR THE FIRST TIME

19:39.133 --> 19:40.533
EVER, RENEWABLES LIKE SOLAR,

19:40.600 --> 19:42.333
WIND, AND HYDROPOWER ACCOUNTED

19:42.400 --> 19:43.900
FOR THE LARGEST PORTION OF NEW

19:43.966 --> 19:45.666
GENERATING CAPACITY.

19:45.733 --> 19:47.400
AND THAT IS GOOD NOT JUST FOR

19:47.466 --> 19:48.900
CONSUMERS, BUT IN MANY CASES,

19:48.966 --> 19:50.433
FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THOSE

19:50.500 --> 19:53.166
FACILITIES ARE BUILT.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.833
IN 2019, WIND ENERGY PROJECTS

19:54.900 --> 19:56.700
ALONE PROVIDED $706 MILLION IN

19:56.766 --> 19:58.200
LAND LEASE PAYMENTS TO RURAL

19:58.266 --> 20:00.233
LANDOWNERS.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.233
SO ENTIRE TOWNS AND AREAS CAN

20:02.300 --> 20:03.466
BENEFIT FROM THE MONEY AND THE

20:03.533 --> 20:05.266
JOBS RENEWABLES CAN BRING -- AS

20:05.333 --> 20:06.666
THIS MAYOR IN WYOMING CAN

20:06.733 --> 20:07.833
ATTEST.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.233
>> MY PERSONAL BELIEF IS IT

20:09.300 --> 20:10.566
PROVIDES MONEY, IT PROVIDES

20:10.633 --> 20:13.133
JOBS, TAXES.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.433
AND THEN I LOOK AT THE TOWNS

20:14.500 --> 20:15.600
THAT THEY'RE BY AND JUST THINK

20:15.666 --> 20:16.900
OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT THEY

20:16.966 --> 20:18.900
WOULDN'T HAVE HAD.

20:18.966 --> 20:20.533
A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE, POLICE

20:20.600 --> 20:22.266
CARS, THOSE KIND OF THINGS.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.966
WHEN I LOOK AT A WIND FARM, ALL

20:24.033 --> 20:25.700
I THINK ABOUT IS CHA-CHING.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.100
>> John: AND THAT'S GREAT.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.333
THOUGH, TO BE CLEAR, WHEN YOU

20:28.400 --> 20:30.400
LOOK AT A WIND FARM, YOU CAN'T

20:30.466 --> 20:30.933
THINK "CHA-CHING," BECAUSE

20:31.000 --> 20:32.100
THAT'S THE CASH REGISTER NOISE.

20:32.166 --> 20:37.833
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A

20:37.900 --> 20:38.933
DIFFEREN TPOINT, BUT THIS IS

20:39.000 --> 20:39.666
IMPORTANT TOO.

20:39.733 --> 20:40.433
WIND FARMS GO "FWHOOOM.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.000
FWHOOOM.

20:41.066 --> 20:41.433
FWHOOOM."

20:41.500 --> 20:42.100
THAT'S HOW WIND FARMS GO.

20:42.166 --> 20:42.966
A CASH REGISTER GOES

20:43.033 --> 20:43.700
"CHA-CHING,"

20:43.766 --> 20:44.633
A SOLAR FARM GOES "TSSSSSS,"

20:44.700 --> 20:45.500
A CAT ON THE DAY EVERYONE FORGOT

20:45.566 --> 20:46.966
ITS BIRTHDAY GOES "ME-OW,"

20:47.033 --> 20:48.533
A HORNY CARTOON WOLF GOES

20:48.600 --> 20:50.066
"AWHOOGA," AND, AGAIN,

20:50.133 --> 20:50.833
WIND FARMS GO, "FWHOOOM.

20:50.900 --> 20:51.433
FWHOOOM.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.433
FWHOOOM."

20:53.500 --> 20:54.166
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT HOW

20:54.233 --> 20:56.433
THINGS GO.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.400
SO THE PHYSICAL GENERATION OF

20:58.466 --> 20:59.633
RENEWABLE ENERGY ISN'T REALLY

20:59.700 --> 21:01.200
THE PROBLEM.

21:01.266 --> 21:02.500
THE KEY ISSUE IS THE

21:02.566 --> 21:04.233
TRANSMISSION OF IT -- BASICALLY,

21:04.300 --> 21:05.600
HOW DO YOU GET THAT ENERGY FROM

21:05.666 --> 21:06.700
WHERE IT'S MADE, LIKE A WIND

21:06.766 --> 21:08.500
FARM IN WYOMING, TO WHERE IT'S

21:08.566 --> 21:09.266
NEEDED, WHICH COULD BE A

21:09.333 --> 21:11.766
THOUSAND MILES AWAY?

21:11.833 --> 21:14.566
AND THAT BRINGS US TO

21:14.633 --> 21:16.933
TRANSMISSION LINES, BECAUSE THEY

21:17.000 --> 21:17.900
ARE AT THE ABSOLUTE HEART OF OUR

21:17.966 --> 21:18.800
GRID, AND WE ARE GOING TO NEED A

21:18.866 --> 21:20.133
LOT MORE OF THEM.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.433
PARTLY BECAUSE, DUE TO THE

21:21.500 --> 21:22.833
LIMITATIONS OF OUR AGING

21:22.900 --> 21:24.266
TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE, IN

21:24.333 --> 21:25.533
SOME PLACES, WE ACTUALLY HAVE

21:25.600 --> 21:26.833
MORE ELECTRICITY THAN WE HAVE

21:26.900 --> 21:30.066
THE CAPABILITY TO TRANSPORT.

21:30.133 --> 21:31.000
FOR INSTANCE, IN VERMONT, THEY

21:31.066 --> 21:32.433
HAD TO PUT A MORATORIUM ON NEW

21:32.500 --> 21:33.833
SOLAR AND WIND PROJECTS BECAUSE

21:33.900 --> 21:34.866
THE TRANSMISSION LINES COULDN'T

21:34.933 --> 21:37.233
CARRY ANY MORE ELECTRICITY.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.633
SO BUILDING OUT NEWER, HIGHER

21:39.700 --> 21:41.466
CAPACITY LINES IS CRUCIALLY

21:41.533 --> 21:42.866
IMPORTANT.

21:42.933 --> 21:44.900
BUT SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T DONE

21:44.966 --> 21:46.233
NEARLY ENOUGH.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.166
AND THAT IS FOR A COUPLE OF

21:48.233 --> 21:49.000
REASONS.

21:49.066 --> 21:49.766
AND THE FIRST BIG ONE IS

21:49.833 --> 21:51.033
LOCATION.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.000
STRINGING POWER LINES OUT ACROSS

21:52.066 --> 21:53.633
THE COUNTRY IS A LOGISTICAL

21:53.700 --> 21:56.066
NIGHTMARE.

21:56.133 --> 21:57.333
UNLIKE INTERSTATE GAS LINES,

21:57.400 --> 21:58.066
WHICH ONLY REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM

21:58.133 --> 21:59.533
THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY

21:59.600 --> 22:01.000
COMMISSION, WITH POWER LINES,

22:01.066 --> 22:02.233
YOU MUST SECURE THE

22:02.300 --> 22:03.533
BUY-IN FROM MULTIPLE STATE AND

22:03.600 --> 22:04.800
LOCAL AGENCIES IN EVERY STATE

22:04.866 --> 22:06.333
YOU PASS THROUGH, ALONGSIDE ALL

22:06.400 --> 22:08.000
THE INDIVIDUAL LANDOWNERS WHOSE

22:08.066 --> 22:09.533
PROPERTY YOU NEED TO USE.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.833
AND LOOK, THERE ARE LEGITIMATE

22:10.900 --> 22:12.533
REASONS FOR PEOPLE TO NOT WANT

22:12.600 --> 22:16.100
POWER LINES IN THEIR BACKYARD --

22:16.166 --> 22:17.266
FOR INSTANCE, IF IT DISRUPTS

22:17.333 --> 22:20.766
THEIR FARMING OPERATION OR GOES

22:20.833 --> 22:21.266
THROUGH ENVIRONMENTALLY

22:21.333 --> 22:22.566
PROTECTED AREAS OR

22:22.633 --> 22:23.833
CULTURAL OR SACRED SITES FOR

22:23.900 --> 22:24.300
NATIVE AMERICANS.

22:24.366 --> 22:25.133
OTHER OBJECTIONS ARE SIMPLY

22:25.200 --> 22:26.600
AESTHETIC.

22:26.666 --> 22:28.266
THE FACT IS, HIGH-VOLTAGE LINES

22:28.333 --> 22:30.233
CAPABLE OF CARRYING MORE

22:30.300 --> 22:30.800
ELECTRICITY REQUIRE BIGGER

22:30.866 --> 22:31.633
TOWERS THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS,

22:31.700 --> 22:33.366
AND SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT

22:33.433 --> 22:35.633
TO SEE THEM.

22:35.700 --> 22:36.433
IT'S SUCH AN ISSUE THAT SOME

22:36.500 --> 22:38.200
COUNTRIES HAVE ACTUALLY MADE

22:38.266 --> 22:38.900
EFFORTS TO BEAUTIFY THEIR

22:38.966 --> 22:40.433
TOWERS.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.200
IN HUNGARY, THEY DECIDED TO

22:42.266 --> 22:43.600
BUILD ONES THAT LOOK LIKE

22:43.666 --> 22:44.533
JESTERS.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.633
IN ICELAND, THEY'VE PROPOSED

22:45.700 --> 22:46.733
THESE DESIGNS FOR A PROJECT

22:46.800 --> 22:48.433
CALLED "LAND OF GIANTS."

22:48.500 --> 22:50.400
AND IN ARGENTINA, THERE IS

22:50.466 --> 22:51.066
"COLOSO," THE GIANT TRANSMISSION

22:51.133 --> 22:51.800
LINE ROBOT.

22:51.866 --> 22:53.333
AT NIGHT, COLOSO LIGHTS UP AND

22:53.400 --> 22:54.800
CAN EVEN SMILE AND WINK.

22:54.866 --> 22:56.366
AND, LOOK, I GET THE SMILE

22:56.433 --> 22:58.400
PART -- YOU WANT COLOSO TO COME

22:58.466 --> 23:00.400
OFF AS FRIENDLY SO CHILDREN

23:00.466 --> 23:02.333
AREN'T TERRIFIED OF THE GIANT

23:02.400 --> 23:03.866
ELECTRIFIED ROBOT WITH GLOWING

23:03.933 --> 23:05.200
MONSTER EYES -- BUT WHY DOES IT

23:05.266 --> 23:07.100
NEED TO WINK?

23:07.166 --> 23:08.000
WHAT IS IT TRYING TO

23:08.066 --> 23:09.400
COMMUNICATE?

23:09.466 --> 23:11.633
IS IT COMING ON TO US?

23:11.700 --> 23:13.633
BECAUSE I FEEL THE SAME WAY

23:13.700 --> 23:15.733
ABOUT COLOSO AS I DO ABOUT THAT

23:15.800 --> 23:17.200
PIGEON -- NEVER IN A MILLION

23:17.266 --> 23:18.100
FUCKING YEARS.

23:18.166 --> 23:18.633
NO, THANK YOU.

23:18.700 --> 23:19.733
PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE

23:19.800 --> 23:20.500
THAT.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.833
IT'S MAKING ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

23:21.900 --> 23:22.400
IT'S MY FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY.

23:22.466 --> 23:23.066
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GIVE HER A

23:23.133 --> 23:24.266
NICE EVENING.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.166
ALTHOUGH I WILL KEEP THE

23:25.233 --> 23:27.100
LONG ISLAND ICED TEA.

23:27.166 --> 23:30.600
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.700
AND THE THING IS, LOCAL

23:32.766 --> 23:33.966
OPPOSITION CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE

23:34.033 --> 23:36.000
IN KILLING TRANSMISSION LINE

23:36.066 --> 23:37.100
PROJECTS.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.233
A FEW YEARS BACK, A COMPANY

23:38.300 --> 23:39.600
PROPOSED PLANS TO BUILD 16 MILES

23:39.666 --> 23:40.700
OF NEW LINES THROUGH

23:40.766 --> 23:43.600
PENNSYLVANIA.

23:43.666 --> 23:45.700
BUT LOCAL LANDOWNERS FORMED A

23:45.766 --> 23:46.833
GRASSROOTS GROUP TO PUSH BACK,

23:46.900 --> 23:47.466
EVEN RELEASING VIDEOS LIKE THIS

23:47.533 --> 23:52.000
ONE TO DETAIL THEIR OBJECTIONS:

23:52.066 --> 23:53.333
>> I UNDERSTAND EVERYBODY NEEDS

23:53.400 --> 23:53.933
ELECTRIC AND EVERYBODY HAS TO

23:54.000 --> 23:54.566
HAVE ELECTRIC.

23:54.633 --> 23:55.933
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE WITHOUT

23:56.000 --> 23:56.933
ELECTRIC.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.933
BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, YOU

23:58.000 --> 24:01.233
KNOW, THIS IS ONLY GOING TO HELP

24:01.300 --> 24:02.533
PEOPLE IN WESTERN PA,

24:02.600 --> 24:03.033
MARYLAND, AND VIRGINIA.

24:03.100 --> 24:03.733
AND WHAT'S IT DO?

24:03.800 --> 24:04.566
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I CHOSE TO

24:04.633 --> 24:05.133
LIVE HERE, AND THEY CHOSE TO

24:05.200 --> 24:05.900
LIVE THERE.

24:05.966 --> 24:06.766
SO DON'T MAKE YOUR PROBLEM MY

24:06.833 --> 24:08.500
PROBLEM.

24:08.566 --> 24:14.900
THAT'S -- THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

24:14.966 --> 24:15.733
>> John: OKAY, I MEAN,

24:15.800 --> 24:16.400
THAT IS A LITTLE MADDENING.

24:16.466 --> 24:17.000
THE MIRRORED SUNGLASSES DON'T

24:17.066 --> 24:17.600
HELP, BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

24:17.666 --> 24:18.900
BECAUSE I DO GET "I DON'T WANT

24:18.966 --> 24:28.100
THIS ON MY LAND," BUT TO MAKE

24:28.166 --> 24:30.333
YOUR ARGUMENT "I DON'T WANT THIS

24:30.400 --> 24:32.333
HERE IF IT'LL HELP HELP SOMEONE

24:32.400 --> 24:32.633
OVER THERE"

24:32.700 --> 24:33.200
MAKES YOU SOUND LIKE A DICK.

24:33.266 --> 24:33.900
ALSO, IF WE DON'T UPGRADE THE

24:33.966 --> 24:34.733
GRID, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE IS

24:34.800 --> 24:35.233
GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS,

24:35.300 --> 24:35.800
INCLUDING YOU.

24:35.866 --> 24:36.400
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "DON'T MAKE

24:36.466 --> 24:37.866
YOUR PROBLEM MY PROBLEM" WHEN

24:37.933 --> 24:39.033
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S YARD IS FULL OF

24:39.100 --> 24:39.866
BEARS.

24:39.933 --> 24:42.100
SURE, BUT WHEN IT GETS OVER THAT

24:42.166 --> 24:43.666
FENCE, GUESS WHAT?

24:43.733 --> 24:45.566
IT'S YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM NOW

24:45.633 --> 24:45.733
TOO.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.566
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THE

24:46.633 --> 24:47.400
HURDLES TRANSMISSION PROJECTS

24:47.466 --> 24:48.933
HAVE TO CLEAR, IT'S NO WONDER IT

24:49.000 --> 24:49.533
CAN TAKE UP TO A DECADE TO GET

24:49.600 --> 24:52.466
NEW ONES APPROVED, IF THEY'RE

24:52.533 --> 24:53.500
APPROVED AT ALL.

24:53.566 --> 24:54.433
AND THIS CAN MAKE IT HARDER TO

24:54.500 --> 24:57.366
BRING RENEWABLE ENERGY ONTO THE

24:57.433 --> 24:57.966
GRID IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:58.033 --> 24:59.266
FEWER THAN A QUARTER OF PROPOSED

24:59.333 --> 25:01.166
ENERGY PROJECTS, LIKE SOLAR AND

25:01.233 --> 25:02.766
WIND, ACTUALLY EVER MAKE IT TO

25:02.833 --> 25:04.600
COMMERCIAL OPERATION BECAUSE OF

25:04.666 --> 25:06.633
TRANSMISSION HURDLES.

25:06.700 --> 25:10.100
AND THAT IS REALLY NOT GOOD.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.533
NOW, THE SECOND BIG OBSTACLE TO

25:11.600 --> 25:14.866
OVERCOME HERE IS COST.

25:14.933 --> 25:16.333
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, THIS WON'T

25:16.400 --> 25:18.766
BE CHEAP.

25:18.833 --> 25:20.133
ONE STUDY PROJECTS DECARBONIZING

25:20.200 --> 25:20.733
OUR POWER GRID COULD COST $2.5

25:20.800 --> 25:21.666
TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE.

25:21.733 --> 25:22.833
TO PUT IT MILDLY, NOT EVERYONE

25:22.900 --> 25:25.600
IS ON BOARD WITH SPENDING THAT

25:25.666 --> 25:27.333
MONEY.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.633
WHEN CONGRESS WAS CONSIDERING

25:29.700 --> 25:30.566
THE CLEAN FUTURE ACT -- A BILL

25:30.633 --> 25:31.966
THAT WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

25:32.033 --> 25:32.600
PROVIDE FOR EXPANDING OUR

25:32.666 --> 25:33.566
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM --

25:33.633 --> 25:34.733
REPRESENTATIVE BILL JOHNSON

25:34.800 --> 25:36.566
ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN

25:36.633 --> 25:38.100
THE NOTION THAT IT COULD

25:38.166 --> 25:39.433
POSSIBLY BE WORTH IT AND WOULD

25:39.500 --> 25:40.300
NOT BACK DOWN.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.066
>> WHETHER THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

25:42.133 --> 25:42.933
ARE STUCK PICKING UP THIS TAB

25:43.000 --> 25:44.600
VIA HIGHER TAXES OR RATE

25:44.666 --> 25:46.933
INCREASES ON THEIR UTILITY

25:47.000 --> 25:48.266
BILLS, CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY THAT

25:48.333 --> 25:50.200
THEY'LL BE RECEIVING A RETURN ON

25:50.266 --> 25:55.566
THEIR INVESTMENT?

25:55.633 --> 25:57.566
>> AS YOU LOOK AT THE

25:57.633 --> 25:58.500
COST-BENEFIT FOR THE HEALTH AND

25:58.566 --> 25:59.033
SAFETY OF COMMUNITIES --

25:59.100 --> 26:00.500
>> NO, WHAT'S THE RETURN ON

26:00.566 --> 26:02.666
INVESTMENT?

26:02.733 --> 26:03.833
WHAT IS THE RETURN ON

26:03.900 --> 26:05.933
INVESTMENT?

26:06.000 --> 26:06.833
THEY'RE MAKING A MONETARY

26:06.900 --> 26:07.633
INVESTMENT WITH THEIR TAXES OR

26:07.700 --> 26:10.466
THEIR RATE INCREASES.

26:10.533 --> 26:12.333
WHAT IS THE RETURN ON THEIR

26:12.400 --> 26:14.666
INVESTMENT?

26:14.733 --> 26:15.733
>> SO THE RETURN ON THE

26:15.800 --> 26:16.333
INVESTMENT IS ACCESS TO CLEAN

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
ENERGY.

26:17.466 --> 26:18.766
IT'S ACCESS TO --

26:18.833 --> 26:20.200
>> NO, THAT'S NOT A RETURN ON

26:20.266 --> 26:21.766
INVESTMENT.

26:21.833 --> 26:25.100
A RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS A

26:25.166 --> 26:25.900
MONETARY THING.

26:25.966 --> 26:26.966
THAT'S WHY YOU MAKE AN

26:27.033 --> 26:27.266
INVESTMENT.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.133
>> John: OKAY, A FEW THINGS:

26:29.200 --> 26:29.466
ONE, SHUT UP.

26:29.533 --> 26:31.500
TWO, IF YOU HAD LET HER TALK FOR

26:31.566 --> 26:32.866
MORE THAN TWO FUCKING SECONDS,

26:32.933 --> 26:33.766
SHE MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU MANY

26:33.833 --> 26:34.700
STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS

26:34.766 --> 26:37.966
COST-EFFECTIVE.

26:38.033 --> 26:38.633
FOR INSTANCE, A FEDERAL LAB

26:38.700 --> 26:39.766
LOOKED INTO EXPANDING

26:39.833 --> 26:40.366
TRANSMISSION LINES ACROSS THE

26:40.433 --> 26:41.233
COUNTRY AND FOUND THAT SUCH A

26:41.300 --> 26:42.633
PROJECT COULD RETURN UP TO $2.50

26:42.700 --> 26:44.200
IN BENEFITS FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF

26:44.266 --> 26:46.000
COST.

26:46.066 --> 26:47.233
WHICH IS, AS AN ASSHOLE MIGHT

26:47.300 --> 26:49.066
PUT IT, A RETURN.

26:49.133 --> 26:50.333
A RETURN ON A FUCKING

26:50.400 --> 26:51.966
INVESTMENT.

26:52.033 --> 26:54.633
BUT SET THAT ASIDE.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.266
SET ASIDE ALSO THAT BLACKOUTS

26:56.333 --> 26:57.000
CAN COST US A LOT OF MONEY, AS

26:57.066 --> 26:58.733
THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS WILL TELL

26:58.800 --> 27:01.766
YOU, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM

27:01.833 --> 27:02.166
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

27:02.233 --> 27:03.900
THERE ARE ALSO MANY BENEFITS

27:03.966 --> 27:05.333
HERE THAT AREN'T PURELY

27:05.400 --> 27:06.400
MONETARY.

27:06.466 --> 27:08.366
A CLEANER GRID HELPS COMBAT

27:08.433 --> 27:09.833
CLIMATE CHANGE, MEANING THAT

27:09.900 --> 27:10.500
MAYBE YOUR GRANDKIDS WON'T DIE

27:10.566 --> 27:13.033
IN WEEKLY LAVA HURRICANES.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.400
WHICH DOES SEEM PRETTY

27:14.466 --> 27:14.700
WORTHWHILE.

27:14.766 --> 27:15.833
FRAMING THIS PURELY A MATTER OF

27:15.900 --> 27:17.533
NET PROFIT SO WEIRD.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.400
IT'S LIKE SAYING,

27:18.466 --> 27:19.666
"WHAT'S THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

27:19.733 --> 27:22.000
IN FUNDING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT?

27:22.066 --> 27:24.200
HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE MAKE OFF

27:24.266 --> 27:25.100
THAT?"

27:25.166 --> 27:26.733
WELL, TECHNICALLY NONE, BUT IF

27:26.800 --> 27:27.866
YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE, SOMEONE

27:27.933 --> 27:29.533
WILL COME WITH A HOSE PUT IT

27:29.600 --> 27:30.066
OUT.

27:30.133 --> 27:30.866
PLUS WE GET THOSE SEXY

27:30.933 --> 27:32.333
FIREFIGHTER CALENDARS FULL OF

27:32.400 --> 27:33.566
OILED-UP FIRE HUNKS.

27:33.633 --> 27:34.633
SO WE GET TO BE SAFER AND

27:34.700 --> 27:35.600
HORNIER.

27:35.666 --> 27:39.033
I'D CALL IT A WIN-WIN.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.800
AND LOOK, I ADMIT, THIS IS GOING

27:40.866 --> 27:42.266
TO REQUIRE A LOT OF COMPROMISE

27:42.333 --> 27:43.433
AND FLEXIBILITY FROM ALL OF US.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.166
BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO OVERCOME

27:45.233 --> 27:46.500
THE HURDLES I'VE DESCRIBED.

27:46.566 --> 27:48.300
WHEN IT COMES TO TRANSMISSION

27:48.366 --> 27:50.933
LINE LOCATION, WE CAN EASE

27:51.000 --> 27:52.266
PEOPLE'S CONCERNS.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.166
NOT NECESSARILY BY GOING FULL

27:53.233 --> 27:55.366
CREEPY COLOSO HERE.

27:55.433 --> 27:57.566
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE WINKED AT.

27:57.633 --> 27:59.300
BUT WE CAN MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE

27:59.366 --> 28:00.900
COMPENSATED FAIRLY FOR THE USE

28:00.966 --> 28:02.066
OF THEIR PROPERTY, OR PLACE

28:02.133 --> 28:06.000
LINES, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,

28:06.066 --> 28:07.500
ON ALREADY "DISTURBED LANDS"

28:07.566 --> 28:09.333
LIKE ALONG RAILROADS AND

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
HIGHWAYS.

28:11.466 --> 28:13.000
AND WHEN IT COMES TO COST, WE'RE

28:13.066 --> 28:14.300
FINALLY MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

28:14.366 --> 28:14.866
THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT

28:14.933 --> 28:15.733
PASSED THE HOUSE THIS WEEK

28:15.800 --> 28:16.766
DEVOTES OVER $65 BILLION TO

28:16.833 --> 28:18.000
IMPROVE THE POWER GRID WITH A

28:18.066 --> 28:19.333
PORTION GOING DIRECTLY TO

28:19.400 --> 28:20.766
TRANSMISSION UPGRADES AND

28:20.833 --> 28:21.766
EXPANSION.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.100
IT IS A GOOD START WHILE ALSO

28:23.166 --> 28:25.033
BEING NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.700
BUT THE KEY THING GOING FORWARD

28:26.766 --> 28:28.433
HERE MIGHT BE TO START THINKING

28:28.500 --> 28:30.366
ABOUT THIS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE

28:30.433 --> 28:32.000
CURRENTLY ARE.

28:32.066 --> 28:33.133
'CAUSE FOR TOO LONG, WHENEVER

28:33.200 --> 28:34.000
WE'VE EXPERIENCED BLACKOUTS,

28:34.066 --> 28:35.166
WE'VE TENDED TO THINK OF IT AS

28:35.233 --> 28:38.300
"THE POWER GRID FAILING."

28:38.366 --> 28:39.200
BUT TRUTH IS, IT'S NOT FAILING

28:39.266 --> 28:40.933
US, WE'RE FAILING IT BY ASKING

28:41.000 --> 28:42.933
IT TO DO SOMETHING IT WASN'T

28:43.000 --> 28:45.100
DESIGNED TO DO IN CONDITIONS IT

28:45.166 --> 28:46.566
WASN'T DESIGNED TO HANDLE.

28:46.633 --> 28:49.400
SO WE NEED TO ACT BOLDLY AND

28:49.466 --> 28:50.900
QUICKLY, AS IF BOTH OUR LIVES

28:50.966 --> 28:52.000
AND OUR SHITTY CASSEROLES

28:52.066 --> 28:53.466
DEPEND ON IT.

28:53.533 --> 28:54.766
AND IF WE DO THIS, IF WE MANAGE

28:54.833 --> 28:55.666
TO PROPERLY UPGRADE OUR POWER

28:55.733 --> 28:58.266
GRID, IT WILL GENUINELY BE ONE

28:58.333 --> 29:00.100
OF THE BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS

29:00.166 --> 29:03.533
OF THE 21ST CENTURY AND ONE

29:03.600 --> 29:06.233
DEFINITELY WORTH CELEBRATING.

29:06.300 --> 29:07.800
PERHAPS, I DON'T KNOW, WITH SOME

29:07.866 --> 29:08.633
BALLOONS!

29:08.700 --> 29:09.633
YOU KNOW?

29:09.700 --> 29:11.000
BALLOONS ARE ALWAYS FUN, AREN'T

29:11.066 --> 29:12.900
THEY?

29:12.966 --> 29:17.200
OH, SHIT.

29:17.266 --> 29:18.133
[EXPLOSION]

29:18.200 --> 29:19.033
OH, SHIT.

29:19.100 --> 29:19.966
OH, NO.

29:20.033 --> 29:21.000
HOLD ON.

29:21.066 --> 29:26.600
I'M OKAY.

29:26.666 --> 29:28.233
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.800
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING, WE

29:29.866 --> 29:30.533
WILL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.366
GOOD --

29:31.433 --> 29:32.033
[BALLOON POPS]

29:32.100 --> 29:32.766
FUCK!

29:32.833 --> 29:36.166
GOOD NIGHT.

29:36.233 --> 29:40.166
THANK YOU, THAT'S IT.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.833
I'M GOING TO GO THIS WAY.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.333
OVER HERE?

29:45.400 --> 29:46.766
WE'LL BE BACK NEXT WEEK.
