Life, right? Are you watching
the rowboat guy video again?

00:26.418 --> 00:28.435
He's not just
the rowboat guy, Lin.

00:28.587 --> 00:30.678
He's Quincy Cox.
He's gonna be the first person

00:30.698 --> 00:32.847
to row by himself
from New Zealand to Nova Scotia,

00:32.867 --> 00:34.775
retracing
the original wool route,

00:34.927 --> 00:36.610
which I guess was a thing?

<i> QUINCY: When I asked</i>

00:38.597 --> 00:41.874

00:49.866 --> 00:50.883
Dad, you do know there's more

00:51.052 --> 00:52.609
than one video
on the Internet, right?

00:52.628 --> 00:54.461
You don't have
to keep watching this one.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.538
It's just, I still can't believe
he's coming here...

00:56.557 --> 00:58.298
to our restaurant today.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.391
Quincy Cox.

00:59.543 --> 01:01.709
You only found out
about this guy yesterday

01:01.729 --> 01:03.136
when the publicist called.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.638
I know. Best call ever.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.807
Quincy Cox is stopping
on his route, in our town,

01:06.959 --> 01:08.809
and they ask him what he wants
to eat, and he says, "A burger,"

01:08.903 --> 01:10.811
and they pick our restaurant.

01:10.963 --> 01:12.220
And you said "Who's Quincy Cox?"

01:12.314 --> 01:14.981
I know. I said that.
I was dumb then. I'm smart now.

01:15.134 --> 01:17.576
-Eh.
-And as if that wasn't
already really great,

01:17.653 --> 01:19.303
a reporter from the paper
is coming here

01:19.396 --> 01:21.062
to cover him eating our burger.

01:21.231 --> 01:22.656
It's huge publicity for us,

01:22.808 --> 01:24.583
so you all need
to get a little more excited.

01:24.810 --> 01:27.402
-It's weird to see Dad happy.
-I don't know if I like it.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.663
Also, this boat is just so cool,
and cozy,

01:29.815 --> 01:31.665
with everything you need.

01:31.817 --> 01:33.317
I could see doing that. Maybe?

01:33.335 --> 01:35.928
<i> You know? With solar panels</i>
<i> that charge the batteries</i>

01:36.155 --> 01:37.745
<i> that power</i>
<i> the navigation system.</i>

01:37.765 --> 01:39.489
<i> And the desalination tank.</i>

01:39.583 --> 01:43.160
<i> The satellite phone,</i>
<i> the tiny cabin to sleep in,</i>

01:43.178 --> 01:44.436
<i> little fishing pole,</i>

01:44.663 --> 01:46.997
<i> and the induction burner</i>
<i> to cook the fish.</i>

01:47.090 --> 01:48.273
Dad, are you gonna leave us
for a rowboat?

01:48.500 --> 01:49.850
If it would have me.

01:50.002 --> 01:51.777
Man, I have never been so glad
to live on the wool route.

01:52.004 --> 01:53.261
I guess
I just take it for granted.

01:53.430 --> 01:54.613
Doesn't he get bored out there?

01:54.764 --> 01:58.375
Rowing and rowing,
every single day? Eh-eh-eh.

01:58.377 --> 02:00.360
Um, okay, Quincy's gonna be
here any minute,

02:00.512 --> 02:02.103
and I don't want him
to see you doing that.

02:02.272 --> 02:05.273
I won't. It just sounds really
boring and dumb, that's all.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.458
Look, maybe it's better

02:06.685 --> 02:07.960
if none of you talk to him
when he's here?

02:08.187 --> 02:09.703
Maybe you could all
be... upstairs?

02:09.797 --> 02:12.798
No way! We're gonna be in the
paper, baby! A picture of us!

02:12.967 --> 02:15.041
Yeah, I curled my hair
for this. Huh?

02:15.194 --> 02:16.635
Just the one, or...?

02:16.862 --> 02:18.470
I mean, I don't really know
how to curl my hair,

02:18.697 --> 02:20.380
but I think
you just twist it up a lot?

02:20.532 --> 02:22.549
-(entry bell jingles)
-Hi! Oh, it's Gene.

02:22.701 --> 02:24.143
Nice to see you, too!

02:24.219 --> 02:25.310
There's our little paper-folder.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.980
How was your first day
in origami club?

02:28.131 --> 02:29.373
-I quit.
-What? No.

02:29.391 --> 02:31.333
Yup. I just thought
it could be my thing.

02:31.393 --> 02:33.727
Like, "Hey,
there's that origami guy.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.971
He looks into your eyes
and folds what's in your soul."

02:36.991 --> 02:40.492
But it turns out
origami is not for-aga-me!

02:40.644 --> 02:42.068
What happened?
You were so excited.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.571
Saturday origami club
at the Rec Center.

02:44.723 --> 02:45.906
It's just so much folding.

02:46.058 --> 02:48.074
And the cranes.
It's all about cranes.

02:48.227 --> 02:49.501
Is that a crane?

02:49.653 --> 02:50.744
LINDA:
I think so.

02:50.896 --> 02:53.246
-A crane's a bird, right?
-It is?!

02:53.399 --> 02:55.399
Gene, you just joined.
You can't quit.

02:55.417 --> 02:56.900
Eh, sometimes
you know right away

02:56.993 --> 02:58.235
when something's not a good fit.

02:58.328 --> 02:59.903
Like when Dad tried
wearing shorts?

02:59.996 --> 03:01.346
Those were a tense couple days.

03:01.498 --> 03:03.498
-Mm.
-It's good
to see things through.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.000
And you've been on a little
bit of a quit-streak lately.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.003
I don't want to do this anymore!
I don't like this!

03:09.023 --> 03:10.022
What was I thinking?

03:10.173 --> 03:11.506
No, thank you!

03:11.525 --> 03:13.525
I was really hoping
this one might stick.

03:13.752 --> 03:15.252
I was gonna be an origami Mommy.

03:15.421 --> 03:18.346
I mean, Lin, maybe it's okay to
quit things that are origami

03:18.365 --> 03:20.106
and all those other things.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.700
Listen, give it another shot.

03:21.851 --> 03:23.702
Go to the next meeting,
and if you still hate it,

03:23.853 --> 03:25.853
-then quit, okay?
-Eh...

03:25.873 --> 03:28.281
-Oh, he's here!
-Oops. Sorry, Mom.
We're doing that now.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.616
And he's walking

03:29.768 --> 03:31.952
as if he's never been
on land before.

03:32.104 --> 03:34.046
No one say anything
about that, okay? Be cool.

03:34.273 --> 03:35.697
-Like this? Mm.
-Stop.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.382
-Like this?
-Guys, stop.

03:37.609 --> 03:39.200
-Be cool like you?
-All of you, stop.

03:39.278 --> 03:41.035
-Hello.
-Quincy Cox. Hi.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.705
Uh, welcome to Bob's Burgers.
We're huge fans.

03:43.799 --> 03:47.451
Are you by yourself, or do
you have, like, an entourage?

03:47.544 --> 03:49.210
Uh, I don't know a lot
about the rowing world.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.789
(sniffs)
Oh, it does not smell
like the ocean in here.

03:52.791 --> 03:54.882
That's the nicest thing anyone's
ever said about this place.

03:54.902 --> 03:58.478
-Louise.
-Oh, I've been dreaming
of a burger for months.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.722
-(high-pitched, soft laugh)
-You sure
you don't want Thai food?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.299
-Or maybe a hoagie?
-Gene.

04:02.468 --> 04:04.150
My publicist says
you're the best burger in town.

04:04.303 --> 04:05.485
Or the closest burger to where

04:05.562 --> 04:07.061
I was getting out
of the ocean, anyhow.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.413
Aw, that's our thing.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.991
And our burgers are good.
I mean, I hope you like it.

04:11.085 --> 04:12.584
Dad, just ask him to prom.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.086
Louise, just leave me alone.

04:14.237 --> 04:16.922
Oh. Whoa! I'm wobbling, right?
Not-not the floors?

04:17.149 --> 04:19.316
Yup. Our floor just
got de-wobbled.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.818
Uh, I'm Bob.
Uh, it's great to meet you.

04:21.837 --> 04:23.578
-Hello, Bob, everyone.
-Hi.

04:23.672 --> 04:25.079
Should I order now?

04:25.173 --> 04:27.674
Oh, aren't we gonna do that
when the reporter gets here?

04:27.768 --> 04:28.934
You know, for the photo op?

04:29.011 --> 04:30.660
Right. The interview,
the photo op.

04:30.679 --> 04:32.345
Uh, let's just check
with my publicist.

04:32.498 --> 04:34.940
"So hungry.
Where is reporter?"

04:35.091 --> 04:36.424
She's typing. Okay.

04:36.518 --> 04:39.594
"He's running 20 mins late,
45 mins max."

04:39.671 --> 04:43.507
"I... might... die...
before then."

04:43.600 --> 04:44.766
Oh, here we go.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.100
She says I can get one now,

04:46.194 --> 04:47.786
and another one
when the reporter gets here.

04:47.937 --> 04:49.437
Okay. You have more
than one burger, right?

04:49.456 --> 04:52.291
I... do. Do-do you want
the burger of the day?

04:52.367 --> 04:53.959
The Mold Man and the Sea Burger.

04:54.186 --> 04:55.852
Comes with blue cheese.
Oh, great.

04:56.021 --> 04:57.704
We told him not to put the word
"mold" on the menu,

04:57.856 --> 04:59.131
but he hates money.

04:59.374 --> 05:02.025
The thought of a juicy, meaty
burger is what kept me going.

05:02.044 --> 05:04.303
It was your meat-avation.
(chuckles) Sorry.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.471
I've only had fish
for the last 12 weeks.

05:06.623 --> 05:09.866
And dehydrated fat-replacement
supplement packets.

05:09.885 --> 05:11.125
Yum!

05:11.219 --> 05:13.812
-Here you go.
-Oh, wow.

05:13.963 --> 05:15.797
I'm gonna eat this fella
nice and slow

05:15.816 --> 05:17.207
so my belly doesn't rupture.

05:17.225 --> 05:20.060
-Cool.
-Mmm! Mmm!

05:20.228 --> 05:23.213
(gasps, cries softly)

05:23.231 --> 05:24.656
Um... are you crying.

05:24.733 --> 05:26.325
It-It's more weeping.

05:26.476 --> 05:28.643
Um, is that...
is that a good thing?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.570
(Quincy whimpering)

05:30.722 --> 05:32.572
(crying):
Oh.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.483
(clears throat)
Uh. Okay.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.502
A little announcement.
I'm done.

05:37.654 --> 05:40.397
Oh. You're done?
W-Was it not... good?

05:40.490 --> 05:42.749
Should I...
go do a different job?

05:42.901 --> 05:44.568
(sniffs)
I'm done with the route.

05:44.586 --> 05:46.570
I'm-I'm done rowing.
I'm-I'm done with the boat.

05:46.588 --> 05:49.497
I'm just done, done with
that dream, thanks to you, Bob.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.575
And I'll tell the reporter
to quote me on that

05:51.668 --> 05:55.078
because this Mold Man isn't
going back to the sea.

05:55.097 --> 05:56.596
-Wait. What?!
-Uh..

05:56.748 --> 05:58.765
(quietly):
Dad, I think your burger
just made him quit.

05:58.842 --> 06:01.251
-Um, thanks, Gene.
-No problem.

06:01.269 --> 06:02.936
Huh...

06:03.088 --> 06:05.530
Do you guys have any ketchup?
Oh, there it is.

06:09.686 --> 06:11.386
But, Quincy, you can't just
be done with rowing.

06:11.463 --> 06:14.355
You were gonna be the first solo
rower to row the wool route.

06:14.449 --> 06:15.949
I can't go back out there, Bob.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.025
This burger's so good.
Uh... I... Oh.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.863
I-I... I just realized
that I miss this too much.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.773
I just want
to live on land again,

06:23.867 --> 06:25.366
eat good food and sleep in a bed

06:25.460 --> 06:27.627
and see people and TV
and department stores.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.705
-Do people still drive cars?
-The cool ones do.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.132
Well, I've said it. I quit.

06:32.284 --> 06:33.617
(laughs)
That feels good.

06:33.635 --> 06:34.876
Yes, it does.

06:34.953 --> 06:37.562
No. No. No.
No, it doesn't feel good.

06:37.789 --> 06:39.380
Quincy, you can't just quit.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.048
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't!

06:41.068 --> 06:42.550
-Can, too!
-I mean, he can.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.903
-Well, he shouldn't.
-Shouldn't he? Hmm?

06:45.054 --> 06:47.814
I can't go back on that boat.
It all makes sense now.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.057
This burger's helped
clear everything away.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.317
-Way to go, Dad.
-Wait.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.637
Let's, uh,
stop blaming the burger.

06:53.639 --> 06:57.082
I mean, Quincy, you're-you're
an inspiration to everyone.

06:57.233 --> 06:58.417
-Well...
-So you can't quit!

06:58.644 --> 07:00.085
What about
what you said earlier, Dad?

07:00.236 --> 07:01.494
"It's okay to quit a thing"?

07:01.663 --> 07:04.238
I remember when you said
those super helpful words,

07:04.332 --> 07:05.982
and I quietly judged you.

07:06.001 --> 07:07.259
But Quincy is rowing
across the world.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.335
Gene was talking
about origami club.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.078
Gene could origami
across the world.

07:11.173 --> 07:13.915
I mean, a paper boat's
probably not great, but...

07:13.934 --> 07:15.416
Also, just saying,
might not make

07:15.436 --> 07:17.269
for the best newspaper article.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.770
"Restaurant's Burger
Makes Man Want

07:18.997 --> 07:20.513
to Quit Inspirational
Thing He Was Doing."

07:20.666 --> 07:23.183
Oh, yeah. We don't want
that article. Oh, God.

07:23.335 --> 07:26.352
And the reporter's gonna be here
any minute now. Oh, no.

07:26.505 --> 07:28.113
-Bob, Bob, come here.
-Okay.

07:28.264 --> 07:31.708
Uh, be right back, Just having
a land talk. (laughs)

07:31.710 --> 07:33.176
That poor guy is delirious.

07:33.195 --> 07:34.678
He doesn't know what
he's saying. Here's the thing.

07:34.846 --> 07:36.846
I would quit, too.
I don't get rowing by yourself

07:37.015 --> 07:38.773
across the ocean, but you do.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.125
You were talking about it like

07:40.202 --> 07:41.626
he was floating around
in a Rolls frickin' Royce.

07:41.778 --> 07:43.536
So you're the guy
who should convince him

07:43.689 --> 07:45.112
to get back in that boat.

07:45.207 --> 07:47.040
And hopefully, really quick,
before the reporter gets here.

07:47.192 --> 07:48.692
It'll be a good example
for Gene, too.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.952
I mean, I was trying,
but I can try more, I guess.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.804
Maybe I'll think
smarter things now

07:53.031 --> 07:54.380
with the same brain
I had before?

07:54.533 --> 07:56.475
See? You're already doing it.

07:56.626 --> 07:58.718
Um, did you...
meet any cool dolphins,

07:58.870 --> 08:00.127
or hit it off with any whales?

08:00.296 --> 08:02.296
-Well, there was this one bird.
-Was it a crane?

08:02.465 --> 08:03.482
-No.
-Good.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.317
But he turned out
to be a bit of a jerk.

08:05.468 --> 08:07.544
Um... so...

08:07.562 --> 08:09.988
-(whispering): Do it.
-(whispering): I'm doing it.

08:10.173 --> 08:11.381
Do it faster.

08:11.399 --> 08:13.808
So, Quincy, I-I...
I'm not good at maps,

08:13.827 --> 08:15.327
but just to say it,
it seems like

08:15.554 --> 08:17.478
you're really close
to the end of your journey.

08:17.572 --> 08:19.389
I think Nova Scotia is what,
just, like,

08:19.482 --> 08:21.224
another thousand-ish miles away?

08:21.226 --> 08:23.560
Aah! A month!
Millions of these.

08:23.578 --> 08:24.836
(grunting)

08:25.063 --> 08:27.230
That's a fun motion
to do a lot of.

08:27.249 --> 08:29.007
And you've come so far.

08:29.234 --> 08:30.734
Also, land is not that great.

08:30.752 --> 08:34.738
Land doesn't have a cozy cabin,
no desalination system.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.257
Just stupid regular water that
doesn't even have salt in it.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.075
But, Quincy, you look like

08:39.094 --> 08:40.577
you're having so much fun
on your website.

08:40.595 --> 08:42.579
-It made me want to do it.
-Oh, that's editing.

08:42.581 --> 08:44.080
There's hours
and hours of footage

08:44.099 --> 08:46.099
of me getting rolled over
by the waves,

08:46.251 --> 08:47.433
vomiting on myself.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.419
Aah! (retching) Aah!

08:49.421 --> 08:51.530
-That's what I'm smelling.
-Ah. Oh, yeah.

08:51.681 --> 08:53.106
And I don't think
they posted the part

08:53.200 --> 08:54.533
where I went totally insane.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.201
You've never seen<i> Footloose!</i>

08:56.278 --> 08:57.594
H-How do you know
you don't like it?!

08:57.612 --> 09:00.096
And all the crying.
They cut that out, I bet?

09:00.115 --> 09:01.948
(crying)
Make it stop!

09:02.100 --> 09:04.951
But, Quincy, what you're doing
affects a lot of other people

09:05.103 --> 09:06.545
'cause they see you do this,

09:06.696 --> 09:09.622
and they do their own version of
rowing a boat around the world.

09:09.775 --> 09:12.884
Be it a paper-folding related
activity or whatever.

09:12.961 --> 09:14.961
-GENE: Mm.
-Yeah, that's right.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.613
People need stuff like that.

09:16.631 --> 09:19.783
Y-You inspired me
to watch all your videos

09:19.801 --> 09:22.543
-and to go for my dreams.
-Nice.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.954
(sighs)
I should tell my publicist
I'm quitting.

09:24.973 --> 09:27.548
Oh, she's gonna be very upset.
She works so hard.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.901
Well, I don't know why
I said she works hard.

09:30.128 --> 09:31.477
Maybe she works
just the normal amount.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.554
I've never actually met her,
but she will be upset.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.965
I mean, maybe just, you know,
take some time,

09:35.984 --> 09:38.318
rest, recharge,
finish your burger.

09:38.470 --> 09:42.396
My burger. My sweet,
sweet Land Burger! Land!

09:42.490 --> 09:44.082
Oh, I mean,
uh, forget the burger.

09:44.159 --> 09:45.475
Maybe focus on the fries?

09:45.568 --> 09:47.586
And the reporter's gonna come,
and this whole

09:47.813 --> 09:50.237
"I want to quit" thing
will feel like just a blip.

09:50.332 --> 09:51.906
You just capsized for a minute.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.650
But our
anti-capsizing technology--

09:53.743 --> 09:56.653
meaning this pep talk--
put us right back up again.

09:56.746 --> 09:58.079
Aah, the capsizing!

09:58.098 --> 10:00.414
-Bob.
-Not capsizing.
Forget I said that.

10:00.508 --> 10:01.991
I'm just very emotional
right now.

10:02.010 --> 10:03.918
And my muscles
are seizing up. Aah!

10:03.937 --> 10:06.771
-Because they miss the ocean!
-You think?

10:06.998 --> 10:09.107
Yes! You got to finish.
Do it for...

10:09.258 --> 10:11.501
this sweet little boy.
Look at this face.

10:11.519 --> 10:13.336
And he needs something
to inspire him.

10:13.355 --> 10:14.613
No, I don't. Don't do it for me.

10:14.764 --> 10:15.947
(muffled):
Mm, mm, mm.

10:16.099 --> 10:17.431
And he's so excited
about you finishing.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.008
Linda, I-I think
you're smothering him.

10:19.027 --> 10:20.176
In so many ways.

10:20.195 --> 10:21.602
Now he's chewing
on your fingers.

10:21.771 --> 10:23.529
-(muffled gnawing)
-Gene, stop. Gene, stop! Gene!

10:23.624 --> 10:26.516
All right, all right.
People are counting on me.

10:26.534 --> 10:28.534
(sighs)
I can do it. I can do it!

10:28.703 --> 10:30.128
I think I can do it.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.704
Just turn off the part
of my brain that feels pain.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.022
And sadness and fear.

10:33.116 --> 10:35.041
And loneliness
and hunger and vomit.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.526
Good for you!

10:36.544 --> 10:38.452
(quietly):
He's back in. Little delicate.

10:38.546 --> 10:40.713
If we don't bring up the tough
stuff, maybe he'll be okay.

10:40.866 --> 10:42.548
Hi, I'm Ralph.
I'm from the paper.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.033
I think we've met before.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.310
-Oh, uh, yeah.
-Hi!

10:45.461 --> 10:47.053
And you must be Quincy Cox.

10:47.205 --> 10:49.764
I cannot believe what you put
yourself through out there.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.541
So dangerous, so isolated.

10:51.559 --> 10:54.152
No one in their right mind
would do what you're doing,

10:54.379 --> 10:55.803
but you're doing it! Amazing!

10:55.822 --> 10:57.138
-Hmm.
-Hmm.
-RALPH: Okay.

10:57.232 --> 10:58.398
Let's get crack-a-lackin'.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.991
My first question.

11:00.143 --> 11:02.568
What are the ten worst things
that happened to you out there?

11:02.663 --> 11:04.496
-(Quincy speaks gibberish)
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, no.

11:04.723 --> 11:06.981
-(Quincy groans)
-Can I bring anyone a water?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.625
Salted or unsalted?

11:12.914 --> 11:14.488
Oh. Are we doing this
in the booth?

11:14.582 --> 11:16.341
And are we doing it lying down?
What are we doing?

11:16.568 --> 11:19.235
-(Quincy moaning)
-He's fine. He's doing great.

11:19.254 --> 11:20.845
Why-why don't I bring
the burger over

11:20.997 --> 11:22.663
and see if we can get Quincy
to sit up?

11:22.757 --> 11:24.516
And... maybe stop crying?

11:24.743 --> 11:25.684
(whispering):
This is bad.

11:25.835 --> 11:27.744
Uh, maybe
we could do a nice picture

11:27.837 --> 11:29.262
before we get to the questions?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.672
Quincy, I'm gonna reach down
and try to help you sit up,

11:31.841 --> 11:33.416
'cause you seem like
you might need a little...

11:33.509 --> 11:35.176
-(groaning): help.
-Bob, your back.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.602
-I know.
-Your back.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.271
-(camera shutter clicking)
-(groans) He's just so tired.

11:38.423 --> 11:40.106
Yeah, yeah, so much rowing.

11:40.258 --> 11:41.866
Gene, go underneath,
go on the other side

11:42.018 --> 11:43.350
and push from there.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.019
Or we just let him
do his own thing?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.854
-Gene, go!
-Okay!

11:46.873 --> 11:48.355
-(Gene grunts softly)
-(Quincy moaning)

11:48.524 --> 11:50.116
-(Gene grunting)
-(camera shutter clicking)

11:50.268 --> 11:51.859
-There we go.
-Oh. Oh.

11:51.878 --> 11:52.952
I'm scared
to let go of this hand.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.546
Put-put his other hand
on the burger.

11:54.697 --> 11:56.381
Quincy, I'm gonna put
your hand on the burger now.

11:56.532 --> 11:58.699
-Okay, totally normal.
-(Quincy groaning)

11:58.719 --> 12:01.368
Now let's let go
so we can take the picture.

12:01.463 --> 12:03.555
-There we go.
-(Gene gasps)
-Oh...

12:03.706 --> 12:04.948
Try again! Try again!

12:04.966 --> 12:06.391
Louise, go get a box
from the basement.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.117
We'll prop him up.
Gene, duck out of the shot.

12:08.286 --> 12:09.561
You guys are focusing
on the wrong thing.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.587
What do we do
about the tear-stained cheeks

12:11.639 --> 12:13.064
and the dead eyes?

12:13.291 --> 12:15.066
Oh, that's just how humans look.
We photoshop it all the time.

12:15.293 --> 12:16.960
-(phone buzzing)
-Aah. Uh-oh.

12:16.978 --> 12:19.053
Have you been selected
for a survey?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.147
My publicist says
I pulled up on the wrong beach.

12:21.299 --> 12:23.557
Oh. I was wondering why there
was no one there to greet me.

12:23.651 --> 12:25.243
It's nice to be greeted,
you know. Nice greeting.

12:25.394 --> 12:27.136
-(phone buzzing)
-Oh. Yup, sounds like

12:27.155 --> 12:28.805
I didn't go to the right dock.

12:28.823 --> 12:30.564
I was supposed to go to the dock
north of the amusement park.

12:30.658 --> 12:33.326
-Oh, so what dock did you go to?
-The beach.

12:33.478 --> 12:35.402
You just pulled up on the beach
and walked here?

12:35.497 --> 12:37.071
-Yeah, I was very hungry.
-(phone buzzing)

12:37.165 --> 12:38.648
Ooh, sounds like
I have to move the boat now,

12:38.741 --> 12:39.907
or they're gonna take it away.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.651
-What? Like, tow it?
-Oh, you know what?

12:41.669 --> 12:43.503
Just let 'em take it.
They can take the whole thing.

12:43.579 --> 12:45.597
Just... It's garbage!
Put it in the garbage!

12:45.748 --> 12:48.457
Set it on fire, I don't care!
Hit-hit it with a stick!

12:48.459 --> 12:50.584
Um, here's a question.
Won't it make it hard

12:50.678 --> 12:52.512
to row without your rowboat?

12:52.697 --> 12:54.272
-Great question.
-I don't even want
to row anymore.

12:54.499 --> 12:56.257
-Oh, he's just, uh...
-Oh, I don't know
that's where you want

12:56.334 --> 12:57.942
-to start with the question.
-Oh, there's your picture.

12:58.169 --> 12:59.669
-Take it now.
-Maybe do some
background stuff.

12:59.762 --> 13:01.170
-Take it now. Look at him.
-Uh, ask him about the bird.

13:01.189 --> 13:02.338
Where? Wh-Where's the bird?

13:02.431 --> 13:03.673
-He just loves that bird.
-(phone buzzing)

13:03.691 --> 13:05.599
Oh, gosh, everyone's so upset.

13:05.693 --> 13:08.102
"Put... it... in...
the garbage!"

13:08.196 --> 13:11.197
Quincy! Quincy, you stay here
and do the interview--

13:11.349 --> 13:12.624
more like
we talked about before--

13:12.775 --> 13:15.685
and I'll go down and help them
stop towing your boat.

13:15.687 --> 13:18.037
This would all be so easy
if you'd just let him quit.

13:18.189 --> 13:20.206
-Gene, go with your father!
-Mm, fine.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.692
-(Gene grunting)
-Easy, easy.

13:22.785 --> 13:25.303
Okay, good luck. I'll-I'll
call you from the beach.

13:25.454 --> 13:26.879
Let's go back
to my first question.

13:27.032 --> 13:28.881
-Ten worst things out there.
-(Linda grunts)

13:29.034 --> 13:30.883
No! No, no, no, no.
No touching that.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.310
Oh, I didn't even know
I did that.

13:32.537 --> 13:33.961
-Maybe you didn't.
-Yeah, maybe I didn't.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.538
-No, you did.
-Who can say?

13:35.631 --> 13:38.224
No boats on the beach.
Move the boat or lose the boat.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.877
Officer, please. This is
Quincy Cox's solo rowboat,

13:40.895 --> 13:42.970
and it's kind of a big deal.

13:43.064 --> 13:45.773
I-I know it seems like he just
left it here on the beach,

13:45.826 --> 13:47.325
but that's 'cause
he's very tired,

13:47.476 --> 13:49.861
because he rowed thousands and
thousands of miles by himself,

13:50.088 --> 13:53.573
and people around the world are
following him on his website.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.333
Uh, do I have reception here?

13:55.484 --> 13:56.984
I-I was gonna show you
the website, Officer.

13:57.078 --> 13:59.078
We-we could, you know,
watch the video.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.672
But I don't have reception.

14:00.823 --> 14:03.399
Also, you know, it wouldn't
look great on my phone.

14:03.418 --> 14:05.826
But can you kind of picture
everything I'm saying?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.512
-No.
-Dad, say everything again,

14:07.663 --> 14:09.922
but this time,
cup his face in your hands.

14:10.091 --> 14:11.257
-Are you close?
<i> -MAN (over radio): Yeah.</i>

14:11.409 --> 14:12.517
Go ahead and get it out of here.

14:12.668 --> 14:15.411
-Take it away.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:15.430 --> 14:17.004
I don't want to talk
about rowing.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.505
I don't want
to talk about rowing!

14:18.558 --> 14:20.191
Okay, that's a neat way
to do this interview,

14:20.418 --> 14:21.767
but let me just ask
another question.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.345
-(whimpering)
-When you're done
making that noise,

14:24.439 --> 14:25.530
I'd love to ask you,

14:25.681 --> 14:27.423
how do you go to the bathroom
on the boat?

14:27.516 --> 14:28.700
Everybody wants to know that.

14:28.851 --> 14:30.443
-It must be so gross.
-(Linda grunts)
-(click)

14:30.595 --> 14:32.519
Sorry. Did you just turn off
my recorder again?

14:32.614 --> 14:34.539
No, no. T-Tina, did you?

14:34.766 --> 14:36.190
-No.
-Louise?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.209
Like, with my mind? No.

14:38.361 --> 14:39.769
Huh. Did you check
the batteries?

14:39.787 --> 14:40.953
Maybe it's the batteries.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.772
Should we smash it
to check the batteries?

14:42.774 --> 14:44.123
-Let's smash it.
-No, no, no!

14:44.217 --> 14:45.717
You are being so weird
about that recorder.

14:45.886 --> 14:49.112
Okay, okay, listen, there's
a dock north of the wharf.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.613
We just have to get it there.

14:50.706 --> 14:52.706
Okay. Then do it. Get it there.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.634
-Wait. Me do it?
-You do it.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.302
Or we tow it and impound it.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.304
Okay. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna do it.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.714
I'll just get in
and row the boat

15:00.883 --> 15:03.751
around the wharf...
in the ocean.

15:03.811 --> 15:05.128
Too bad it's not a stream.

15:05.221 --> 15:07.296
'Cause then we could do
the "gently down it" part.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.223
The "merrily" part, too,
would be nice.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.484
I actually don't know
where you're gonna sit, Gene.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.803
-How about there? (grunts)
-I think that's where

15:13.896 --> 15:15.805
-my legs go, but-but sure.
-(grunts)

15:15.823 --> 15:17.990
Oh, shoes are wet.
Shoes and socks.

15:18.143 --> 15:20.159
I wish I had taken them off
before doing this.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.402
Bye-Bye, Officer Man!

15:21.496 --> 15:23.479
Tell everyone we know
we love them!

15:23.572 --> 15:24.756
-What?
-Nothing!

15:24.983 --> 15:28.484
Okay. Gene, um, take my phone
and text your mother

15:28.486 --> 15:29.910
that we're making
great decisions,

15:30.004 --> 15:33.247
and not to worry,
but we are in... the ocean.

15:33.299 --> 15:36.826
I'll just say,
"In ocean. Very, very safe.

15:36.919 --> 15:39.253
Just remember the good times."

15:39.330 --> 15:40.546
Gene, we're gonna be fine.

15:40.682 --> 15:42.607
I just... I don't know
where the paddles are.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.167
Oh, got 'em, found 'em.

15:44.260 --> 15:45.685
Oh, dropped one.
That's not good.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.261
But they float. That's... smart.

15:47.355 --> 15:49.781
Okay, I got it. I got it back.
(grunts)

15:50.008 --> 15:51.524
Uh, take me back
to shore, please.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.767
We're still at shore.
We haven't moved.

15:53.861 --> 15:55.194
-Oh.
-Oh, my God.

15:55.363 --> 15:56.770
I'm rowing Quincy Cox's boat.

15:56.864 --> 15:59.182
Oh, my God. I have no idea
how to row Quincy Cox's boat.

15:59.275 --> 16:00.774
I won't even mention
that you're sitting backwards.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.201
-What? No, I'm not.
-Shh, shh, shh.

16:02.353 --> 16:04.003
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.

16:08.193 --> 16:10.451
Okay, we-we got past
the crashy, wavy part,

16:10.528 --> 16:12.695
and now we're onto
the rocky, wavy part.

16:12.864 --> 16:14.639
And I remember when I thought
it would be really cool

16:14.808 --> 16:16.549
to be on this boat, but now,
I feel a little differently

16:16.701 --> 16:19.310
because this is...
really... difficult.

16:19.462 --> 16:21.037
-It's not that hard.
-Uh-huh.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.723
-Oh, Gene, put that on.
-What is it? A neck pillow?

16:23.875 --> 16:26.209
-No, it's a life jacket,
I think.
-How do I put it on?

16:26.227 --> 16:27.468
I don't understand

16:27.636 --> 16:29.545
this new-fangled
life vest technology!

16:29.564 --> 16:32.215
All right, just hold it.
And if the boat flips over,

16:32.233 --> 16:33.716
hold it really tightly.

16:33.735 --> 16:36.052
The fear in your voice
makes me feel great about this.

16:36.070 --> 16:37.553
(Quincy snoring)

16:37.646 --> 16:40.239
Um, did he just fall asleep
during my interview?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.774
Yeah, but I think
you got what you need.

16:41.926 --> 16:44.318
-I got no answers.
-That's not true.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.578
When you asked him that question

16:45.730 --> 16:47.563
about how he goes
to the bathroom, he said...

16:47.582 --> 16:49.415
-(makes whimpering sounds)
-No, that doesn't count.

16:49.567 --> 16:51.250
And I didn't even get
a good picture.

16:51.402 --> 16:53.069
We can solve that problem
right now.

16:53.162 --> 16:55.738
-Curl, do your stuff. And shoot.
-(phone buzzing)

16:55.757 --> 16:58.908
"In ocean. Talk soon."
What the hell does that mean?

16:59.001 --> 17:01.001
Oh, my God!
Bob's rowing the boat!

17:01.095 --> 17:02.836
-What?!
-(gasps) I quit!

17:02.930 --> 17:04.597
-What?!
-Bob's rowing your boat!

17:04.749 --> 17:07.250
Is that a bad thing?
That seems like a bad thing!

17:07.343 --> 17:09.027
Uh, you know,
it's not recommended.

17:09.178 --> 17:10.344
It can be a little squirrelly

17:10.513 --> 17:11.937
if you haven't been rowing
for 11 months.

17:12.090 --> 17:14.014
-How-how is he with capsizing?
-Aah!

17:14.034 --> 17:15.700
Probably not great.

17:15.927 --> 17:17.035
Counterpoint: He loves it.

17:17.262 --> 17:18.944
-Okay, we're going down there.
-Yeah, we are.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.780
And, Quincy,
maybe you can tell me more

17:20.874 --> 17:22.540
about that whole quitting thing
on the way.

17:22.691 --> 17:23.857
Oh, you just fell down.

17:23.984 --> 17:25.859
-I'm up. I'm up. I'm back up.
-No.

17:25.953 --> 17:27.453
-Oh, am I not?
-Everyone, pick him up.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.121
Let's go. Get him.
Everyone take a side.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.439
-(Quincy grunts)
-Up, up, up.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.441
Ah, yep. Oof. I'm halfway up.

17:32.443 --> 17:34.277
I can't see where we're going.

17:34.295 --> 17:35.720
Can you see where we're going?

17:35.871 --> 17:37.555
-No. I mostly see your stomach.
-Aah.

17:37.782 --> 17:40.783
We're fine. I mean,
how much ocean can there be?

17:40.802 --> 17:43.061
Well, I hope the dock
we're trying to get to is...

17:43.288 --> 17:44.419
getting closer to us?

17:44.472 --> 17:45.971
That would be a fun coincidence.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.215
Oh, there they are!
Way out there!

17:48.309 --> 17:49.901
-Are you okay?!
-Aah. Aah! It's your mom.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.644
-Why are you rowing?!
-I think she's saying

17:51.796 --> 17:52.978
we're doing a great job?

17:53.055 --> 17:54.480
And did she say
I'm doing especially good

17:54.574 --> 17:56.299
at sitting
in the bottom of the boat?

17:56.467 --> 17:57.967
I mean, I guess it's obvious.

17:57.985 --> 17:59.635
So, while we've got a minute,
tell me more

17:59.654 --> 18:02.062
about the "I quit" thing
that you said before.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.657
Too hard, right? Too hard out
there? Way too hard for you?

18:04.809 --> 18:06.826
The sea broke you down.
Is that the story I'm writing?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.419
That's the story
I'm writing, right?

18:08.571 --> 18:10.237
-(Bob groaning)
-Oh, he's really struggling.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.647
He's not doing well, is he?

18:11.666 --> 18:13.424
Is something wrong
with his arms? And his body?

18:13.651 --> 18:15.242
There's nothing wrong
with his arms and his body.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.078
Well, there's some things wrong
with his body, Mom.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.430
He's trying to save your boat

18:19.599 --> 18:21.841
because you were having
a freakout in our restaurant.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.267
It's just... Wow.

18:23.494 --> 18:24.769
Seeing someone else in my boat

18:24.920 --> 18:26.495
is making me feel
kind of possessive.

18:26.589 --> 18:28.681
I don't like it. I feel like
I should be doing that.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.257
Yes, yes, you should!

18:30.351 --> 18:31.943
I mean, I wouldn't be doing it
anything like that.

18:32.094 --> 18:33.486
That is so inefficient.

18:33.596 --> 18:36.522
Yeah, I'm having second thoughts
about the quitting.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.600
Um... I'm kind of liking
the quitting story.

18:39.677 --> 18:41.861
Yeah, I'm having regrets
about my earlier thoughts.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.362
Well, I'm the one
writing the piece.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.030
Well, I'm the one
withdrawing my statement!

18:45.125 --> 18:46.624
Hey, you two, we got to move!

18:46.775 --> 18:49.276
But, I mean, not that fast?
'Cause look at 'em.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.020
Yeah, we'll definitely get there
before them.

18:51.113 --> 18:53.280
-So, hot dog?
-Yeah, I-I could eat a hot dog.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.449
Oh, yeah. A picture of you,
with the ocean behind you,

18:55.468 --> 18:57.693
eating a hot dog--
that would be great!

18:57.712 --> 18:59.119
LINDA:
No! No, burger!

18:59.139 --> 19:01.030
Burger, burger, burger for you!

19:01.123 --> 19:02.289
No hot dogs.

19:02.383 --> 19:04.308
(groans)
My chest is on fire.

19:04.460 --> 19:07.720
And so are my arms.
Ugh. And my toes.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.963
Am I buff?
Did I just get into shape?

19:10.041 --> 19:11.649
That sounds right.
Me, too, probably?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.709
But... this is very hard.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.211
I get wanting to quit.

19:15.229 --> 19:16.821
See? Just like origami club.

19:16.972 --> 19:18.881
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

19:18.883 --> 19:21.717
Hey!
There's the dock... somehow.

19:21.736 --> 19:23.161
But on the other hand, Gene,

19:23.388 --> 19:24.720
I think what your mom
is worried about is

19:24.813 --> 19:27.814
that if you quit too much stuff,
you might get used to it.

19:27.909 --> 19:30.168
And then, you might quit,
like, everything

19:30.319 --> 19:31.577
that's even a little bit hard,

19:31.729 --> 19:33.062
and you'll never
challenge yourself.

19:33.155 --> 19:35.581
You're taking origami Mommy's
side on this?

19:35.675 --> 19:38.009
Well, you know, she's smart.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.419
And I... I think
that what she was getting at--

19:40.571 --> 19:42.087
which I didn't see then,
but I see now,

19:42.240 --> 19:43.681
because, you know,
I'm a different person now,

19:43.832 --> 19:45.591
because, you know,
the ocean changes you--

19:45.743 --> 19:48.669
is pretty much everything
that's worth doing is hard.

19:48.763 --> 19:51.189
(grunts)
And if you quit things
when they get hard,

19:51.357 --> 19:52.690
you may never get
to the good part.

19:52.767 --> 19:56.527
Ah, fine. I'll give
origami club another chance.

19:56.679 --> 19:59.012
-Really?
-I do kind of want
to do that frog.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.531
His legs move.

20:00.758 --> 20:01.941
(grunts)
Sounds hard.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.351
-True.
-But... so is this. (grunts)

20:04.370 --> 20:05.686
You know,
in case you were wondering

20:05.705 --> 20:07.263
while you just sit there.

20:07.281 --> 20:09.765
I wasn't wondering because
you've said it so many times.

20:09.858 --> 20:12.768
Do you want me to take a turn?

20:12.861 --> 20:15.028
-Oh, we're here.
-Bobby, yay!

20:15.122 --> 20:16.863
My hero! You made it!

20:16.958 --> 20:18.941
Sort of. I mean,
the oars are backwards.

20:19.034 --> 20:21.552
-Are you all eating hot dogs?
-No.

20:21.704 --> 20:23.279
-Wait'll you see
the picture, Dad.
-What?!

<i> He finished!</i>

20:25.391 --> 20:27.058
Good for him.

20:27.285 --> 20:28.875
He looks tired. Kind of scrawny.

20:28.970 --> 20:30.286
His skin's a strange color, too.

20:30.379 --> 20:31.637
Oh, and his lips
are peeling off.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.565
-Gross. But he's smilin'!
