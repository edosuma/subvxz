00:10.749 --> 00:13.491
<i>
Previously on Fiasco...</i>

00:13.622 --> 00:15.580
<i>President Reagan's
national security advisor, </i>

00:15.711 --> 00:17.234
<i>Robert "Bud" McFarlane,</i>

00:17.365 --> 00:19.193
<i>begins negotiations with Iran</i>

00:19.323 --> 00:21.238
<i>and agrees
to exchange weapons </i>

00:21.369 --> 00:23.893
<i>for the release
of American hostages. </i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.590
<i>The deal generates
millions of dollars </i>

00:25.721 --> 00:27.636
<i>that Oliver North
and Richard Secord </i>

00:27.766 --> 00:29.464
<i>divert towards the Contra War.</i>

00:31.596 --> 00:33.424
<i>But after many shipments
of weapons, </i>

00:33.555 --> 00:35.905
<i>only one hostage is released,</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:39.343
<i>and McFarlane loses faith
and abruptly resigns, </i>

00:39.474 --> 00:41.041
<i>only to be called out
of retirement </i>

00:41.171 --> 00:43.304
<i>for a top secret,
face-to-face meeting </i>

00:43.434 --> 00:46.089
<i>with Iranian delegates
in Tehran. </i>

00:46.220 --> 00:48.265
<i>The trip is a disaster
that leaves the Americans </i>

00:48.396 --> 00:50.702
<i>frustrated, demoralized,</i>

00:50.833 --> 00:52.835
<i>and desperate
for a new strategy. </i>

00:59.711 --> 01:03.019
<i>As you know by now, there are
plenty of twists and turns </i>

01:03.150 --> 01:05.456
<i>in the story
Americans know as Iran-Contra. </i>

01:09.460 --> 01:11.288
<i>There was one twist
in particular </i>

01:11.419 --> 01:13.203
<i>that caught everyone
by surprise. </i>

01:29.437 --> 01:30.699
Hello?

01:44.452 --> 01:46.323
<i>
This is Hassan Sabra, </i>

01:46.454 --> 01:47.759
<i>and he's kind of responsible</i>

01:47.890 --> 01:51.372
<i>for breaking
Iran-Contra wide open. </i>

01:56.246 --> 01:58.683
<i>He did it in the pages
of a Lebanese magazine </i>

01:58.814 --> 02:00.555
<i>called</i> Ash-Shiraa.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.796
<i>In the fall of 1986,</i>

02:24.927 --> 02:27.495
<i>two secret operatives
came to Sabra's office </i>

02:27.625 --> 02:29.540
<i>with a tip
that would change his life. </i>

02:52.563 --> 02:53.869
<i>
The article appeared </i>

02:53.999 --> 02:55.523
<i>in the Lebanese weekly
Ash-Shiraa</i>

02:55.653 --> 02:56.959
<i>published in Beirut.</i>

02:57.089 --> 02:58.787
<i>The editor,
Hassan Sabra, explained </i>

02:58.917 --> 03:00.180
<i>what he thought
the Iranians want. </i>

03:21.070 --> 03:22.724
<i>
The news that Ronald Reagan </i>

03:22.854 --> 03:24.900
<i>secretly traded Iran military
equipment for hostages </i>

03:25.030 --> 03:26.902
<i>is only the latest.</i>

03:27.032 --> 03:28.730
Trouble is,
secrets don't keep very well.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.122
And when they come out,

03:30.253 --> 03:31.907
the damage to an
administration's credibility

03:32.037 --> 03:33.952
can last a very long time.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.259
<i>How would Reagan's
administration react </i>

03:36.390 --> 03:38.957
<i>when a little-known
magazine editor in Beirut </i>

03:39.088 --> 03:41.830
<i>stumbled upon the secrets
they had been trying to hide? </i>

03:41.960 --> 03:43.614
Mr. President, is it
true that you authorized

03:43.745 --> 03:46.487
sending military supplies
to Iran?

03:46.617 --> 03:48.967
I've never heard
such dissemination

03:49.098 --> 03:51.361
of misinformation

03:51.492 --> 03:52.884
since I've been here

03:53.015 --> 03:55.539
as has been going on
in the last several days.

03:55.670 --> 03:59.108
They wanted us also to help

03:59.239 --> 04:03.591
with the freeing
of other hostages.

04:04.983 --> 04:06.855
<i>What would happen
to those who exposed </i>

04:06.985 --> 04:09.771
<i>all those secrets and upset
the carefully laid plans </i>

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
<i>of the powerful
people involved? </i>

04:55.991 --> 04:58.472
<i>I'm Leon Neyfakh.</i>

04:58.602 --> 05:02.084
<i>This is</i> Fiasco.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.434
<i>The story of Iran-Contra.</i>

05:14.488 --> 05:18.274
<i>While members of his
administration were in Tehran </i>

05:18.405 --> 05:20.972
<i>negotiating the release
of American hostages... </i>

05:21.103 --> 05:23.279
- Thank you.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.629
Really is great to be back
on the campaign trail.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.632
It almost feels like 1980
all over again.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.982
<i>...Ronald Reagan
focused on the home front. </i>

05:36.379 --> 05:37.772
We love Ron!
We love Ron!

05:37.902 --> 05:39.817
We love Ron!

05:39.948 --> 05:41.950
<i>The president spent
the 1986 midterms </i>

05:42.080 --> 05:44.779
<i>traveling around the country,
rallying support </i>

05:44.909 --> 05:46.563
<i>for Republicans
running for Congress. </i>

05:46.694 --> 05:48.304
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:48.435 --> 05:49.958
the president
of the United States,

05:50.088 --> 05:51.176
President Ronald Reagan.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.835
I need a congressman
who will support me

05:57.966 --> 06:00.969
instead of someone who
opposes me 60% of the time.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.669
During the second midterm,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.976
congressional election
is very, very tough.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.108
You're really worn out by then,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.981
and the opposing party
has a lot to say.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.200
Write it down.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.856
Next January
there'll be 53 Democrats

06:18.987 --> 06:20.205
in the United States Senate

06:20.336 --> 06:22.556
and 47 Republicans.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.209
But, you know,

06:24.340 --> 06:26.734
this talking about
political differences and all

06:26.864 --> 06:28.475
reminds me of a story.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.611
It was a Democratic fundraiser
at a downtown hotel.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.047
And when they came out
of the fundraiser,

06:36.178 --> 06:37.745
there was a kid
with some puppies,

06:37.875 --> 06:39.224
and he was selling them.

06:39.355 --> 06:42.576
"Buy a Democrat puppy.
Buy a Democrat puppy."

06:42.706 --> 06:44.229
But two weeks later,

06:44.360 --> 06:46.623
the Republicans held
a fundraiser in the same place.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.712
When they came out,
the same kid was there--

06:48.843 --> 06:51.889
"Buy a Republican puppy.
Buy a Republican puppy."

06:52.020 --> 06:53.761
Kid says, "Now they got
their eyes open."

06:57.460 --> 06:59.027
<i>
Reagan's team had struggled </i>

06:59.157 --> 07:01.333
<i>to come up with a message
to campaign on. </i>

07:01.464 --> 07:04.032
<i>They found one
in a star-studded crusade </i>

07:04.162 --> 07:06.164
<i>spearheaded by
the president's wife, Nancy. </i>

07:06.295 --> 07:08.428
See this cute little vial here?

07:08.558 --> 07:12.083
It's crack, rock cocaine,
the most addictive form.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.216
You think it's the glamour drug
of the '80s?

07:14.346 --> 07:16.610
Well, that's the point of
this friendly little reminder.

07:16.740 --> 07:17.915
It can kill you.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.918
Well, the...

07:21.049 --> 07:24.008
the decision to run
that campaign was not mine.

07:24.139 --> 07:26.533
But the decision to work
on that speech was.

07:29.971 --> 07:34.715
I met with the Reagans
in California to hear them out

07:34.845 --> 07:37.021
and listen to what
they wanted to say.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.241
And it was very,
very important to her

07:39.371 --> 07:41.069
and very,
very important to him

07:41.199 --> 07:43.419
to get that message across.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.814
Now you can see why drug abuse
concerns every one of us,

07:46.944 --> 07:49.207
all the American family.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.818
<i>
With the crack epidemic </i>

07:50.948 --> 07:52.602
<i>surging in America's cities,</i>

07:52.733 --> 07:54.125
<i>Reagan's anti-drug message</i>

07:54.256 --> 07:56.388
<i>struck a chord
with his base of voters </i>

07:56.519 --> 07:59.304
<i>who believed in God
and family values. </i>

07:59.435 --> 08:00.784
Are you afraid
when you go out on the street

08:00.915 --> 08:01.698
- at night?
- Yes.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.308
Why?

08:03.439 --> 08:04.701
There's a lot of drug dealers.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.747
They be shooting.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.357
Drugs take away the dream

08:08.488 --> 08:12.056
from every child's heart
and replace it with a nightmare.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.058
Each of us has
to put our principles

08:14.189 --> 08:16.104
and consciences on the line.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.062
There's no moral middle ground.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.543
Indifference is not an option.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.024
I can't help
but see all the young people

08:23.154 --> 08:24.808
who are here
in the audience,

08:24.939 --> 08:26.767
and I have a special message
to you from my roommate.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.510
She said to tell you,

08:30.640 --> 08:34.209
"When it comes to drugs,
please, for yourselves,

08:34.339 --> 08:36.341
"for your families,
for your future,

08:36.472 --> 08:38.126
"and for your country,

08:38.256 --> 08:40.215
just say no."

08:47.918 --> 08:49.137
I mean,
if the Reagan administration

08:49.267 --> 08:50.878
had "just said no"

08:51.008 --> 08:52.793
to Contra drug smuggling

08:52.923 --> 08:54.185
and to cavorting
and collaborating

08:54.316 --> 08:56.144
with drug smugglers,

08:56.274 --> 08:57.754
they would never have been
tarred and feathered.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.196
My name is Martha Honey.

09:05.327 --> 09:08.025
My name is Tony Avrigan.

09:08.156 --> 09:11.507
And we lived and reported
out of Central America,

09:11.638 --> 09:13.335
based in Costa Rica
for the 1980s.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.425
We went down to Costa Rica

09:16.556 --> 09:18.296
and really fell
in love with it.

09:18.427 --> 09:19.907
It seemed
like a good place

09:20.037 --> 09:21.299
to raise our kids and...

09:21.430 --> 09:22.692
And so we decided
to move there.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.479
The only thing
we didn't know was

09:27.610 --> 09:30.091
our moving there
sort of coincided

09:30.221 --> 09:33.137
almost exactly with the CIA's
taking a look at Costa Rica

09:33.268 --> 09:34.356
and saying, "Hmm."

09:40.362 --> 09:42.233
<i>Martha Honey
and Tony Avrigan </i>

09:42.364 --> 09:44.888
<i>started to notice
the Nicaraguan rebel force, </i>

09:45.019 --> 09:48.283
<i>the Contras, setting up shop
in Costa Rica. </i>

09:48.413 --> 09:50.067
And I remember one night,

09:50.198 --> 09:51.852
soon after we moved there,

09:51.982 --> 09:53.549
driving through
a neighborhood,

09:53.680 --> 09:55.203
and you'd look
in the front window,

09:55.333 --> 09:56.552
and there would be
a Costa Rican family

09:56.683 --> 09:58.293
having dinner,
and then the next one,

09:58.423 --> 09:59.947
a Costa Rican family
sitting around the television,

10:00.077 --> 10:01.905
and then the next one,

10:02.036 --> 10:04.560
all these guys in kind
of partial military uniforms

10:04.691 --> 10:06.475
standing over
a mimeograph machine,

10:06.606 --> 10:09.260
and that was a Contra
operation going on.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.874
There began to be reports
in the local press

10:14.004 --> 10:16.441
that the U.S. government
was involved

10:16.572 --> 10:19.357
in facilitating operations
out of there.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.665
But our editors were
very skeptical and said,

10:22.796 --> 10:24.449
"Well, that's not what the
State Department's telling us.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.277
"They are telling us
that the U.S.

10:26.408 --> 10:30.412
is not involved
militarily in Costa Rica."

10:30.542 --> 10:32.675
<i>Something wasn't
quite adding up. </i>

10:32.806 --> 10:34.895
The waning days of
the last session of Congress,

10:35.025 --> 10:36.113
we passed
the Boland Amendment.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.595
<i>
Remember the Boland Amendment? </i>

10:39.726 --> 10:41.379
The House Intelligence
Committee today

10:41.510 --> 10:43.425
voted to cut off U.S. funds

10:43.555 --> 10:46.297
for secret intelligence
activities in Nicaragua.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.343
<i>The vote reflects
a growing concern in Congress </i>

10:48.473 --> 10:51.085
<i>that CIA funds
are being used to overthrow </i>

10:51.215 --> 10:53.740
<i>the Sandinistan government
in Nicaragua. </i>

10:53.870 --> 10:56.960
<i>Since official funds
couldn't flow to the Contras, </i>

10:57.091 --> 10:59.136
<i>the administration
funneled private money </i>

10:59.267 --> 11:00.921
<i>to the rebel forces
fighting the war. </i>

11:03.532 --> 11:06.622
Oliver North's whole
secret re-supply operations,

11:06.753 --> 11:09.451
all of it was focused
on Nicaragua,

11:09.581 --> 11:11.975
but it was operating
out of Costa Rica.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.891
<i>
The U.S. wasn't supposed </i>

11:15.022 --> 11:17.415
<i>to be helping the Contras.</i>

11:17.546 --> 11:19.330
<i>But Martha and Tony
were receiving clear evidence </i>

11:19.461 --> 11:21.071
<i>that they were.</i>

11:21.202 --> 11:23.291
We made frequent visits up

11:23.421 --> 11:25.336
to the southern front
into Nicaragua.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.470
It's a pleasure.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.080
And suddenly,

11:30.211 --> 11:32.300
they started
showing us mortars

11:32.430 --> 11:36.304
and small
artillery pieces painted

11:36.434 --> 11:39.873
in desert camouflage colors
in the rain forest.

11:41.222 --> 11:44.529
And they wore always
these huge-sized pants

11:44.660 --> 11:48.011
and huge boots made
for 6'6" Americans.

11:49.491 --> 11:53.060
And so they had their pants
sort of up to their chest.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.584
And the Reagan administration
vehemently denied

11:55.715 --> 11:57.978
anything was going on,
but as we quickly learned,

11:58.108 --> 11:59.240
all you had to do
was open your eyes.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.161
<i>And while weapons
and uniforms </i>

12:07.291 --> 12:09.293
<i>were going
into Central America, </i>

12:09.424 --> 12:12.383
<i>something else
may have been going out. </i>

12:12.514 --> 12:16.431
It was a difficult story
to really prove.

12:16.561 --> 12:19.739
But we kept kind of running
into the drug trafficking,

12:19.869 --> 12:24.134
and it sort of became a story
that we finally had to take on.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.354
Drugs are menacing our society.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.008
They are threatening our values

12:28.138 --> 12:29.923
and undercutting
our institutions.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.055
They're killing our children.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.231
<i>Even as
the Reagan administration </i>

12:34.362 --> 12:37.017
<i>was telling Americans
to just say no... </i>

12:37.147 --> 12:39.193
We can defeat this enemy.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.455
<i>...some of
the President's beloved </i>

12:40.585 --> 12:42.239
<i>Freedom Fighters,
the Contras, </i>

12:42.370 --> 12:45.025
<i>were smuggling drugs
into the United States. </i>

12:45.155 --> 12:47.418
But we still have much to do.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.551
Despite our best efforts,

12:49.681 --> 12:52.249
illegal cocaine is coming
into our country

12:52.380 --> 12:53.468
at alarming levels.

12:55.383 --> 12:58.473
Drug smuggling is just
one of a long list

12:58.603 --> 13:03.608
of kind of the dark, dirty side
of many paramilitary wars.

13:03.739 --> 13:06.263
And the Contra war
was no exception.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.180
When Oliver North
started to build

13:10.311 --> 13:12.487
this secret
resupply operation,

13:12.617 --> 13:14.706
he used pilots who had already

13:14.837 --> 13:16.926
been convicted
of drug smuggling.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.449
Why?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.974
Because they were
readily available.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.500
And we interviewed
a number of these pilots

13:25.630 --> 13:28.111
who began talking
about their ties to the CIA

13:28.242 --> 13:29.852
and how they would fly into,
for instance,

13:29.983 --> 13:34.074
Homestead Air Force Base
which was outside of Miami.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.466
As an extra added bonus,

13:35.597 --> 13:37.468
we could freelance
on the way back.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.470
Meaning what?

13:39.601 --> 13:42.691
Well, I mean, we could--we
could bring back our own cargo

13:42.822 --> 13:45.346
without ever having to worry
about interception,

13:45.476 --> 13:46.434
arrest or anything like this.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.871
Everything was taken care of.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.874
They would leave the plane,
but it would not be inspected

13:52.005 --> 13:55.530
as other planes coming in were
because it had drugs on it.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.097
Given your experience,

13:57.227 --> 13:58.620
who do you figure
arranged all of this?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.491
What's your best guess?

14:00.622 --> 14:03.886
Had to be someone
in either the top four--

14:04.017 --> 14:07.411
three slots of the CIA
as I know their organization.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.632
The U.S. said, "Well, of course
these pilots are going to say

14:10.762 --> 14:12.852
<i>they're working for the CIA
to try to protect themselves." </i>

14:12.982 --> 14:14.505
Had to be someone that high up.
It'd have to be.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.333
Why?

14:16.464 --> 14:18.161
Because who else can you get
that's gonna know,

14:18.292 --> 14:19.859
number one,
the inner working of everything

14:19.989 --> 14:21.904
but who can pick up a phone
and say, "Let this happen"?

14:23.775 --> 14:25.255
I would say
the majority of people

14:25.386 --> 14:27.257
working with Oliver North

14:27.388 --> 14:28.868
were not involved
in drug smuggling,

14:28.998 --> 14:31.261
but there were enough people
who were involved.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.611
And that's wrong.
That's criminal.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.396
And it was just among
the priorities

14:35.526 --> 14:37.615
that the Reagan
administration set

14:37.746 --> 14:41.619
where the health
and security against drugs

14:41.750 --> 14:45.145
of young people
and communities of color

14:45.275 --> 14:48.235
in this country
was inconsequential

14:48.365 --> 14:50.715
compared to the top priority--

14:50.846 --> 14:53.631
overthrowing
the Sandinista government.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.243
<i>In order to bolster
the Contra forces, </i>

14:56.373 --> 14:58.854
<i>the United States created
a base of operations </i>

14:58.985 --> 15:01.988
<i>in the demilitarized country
of Costa Rica. </i>

15:03.076 --> 15:05.730
<i>This was not well received
by the locals. </i>

15:05.861 --> 15:07.602
<i>Last week saw
one of the biggest ever </i>

15:07.732 --> 15:10.605
<i>demonstrations held
in this 35-year-old democracy. </i>

15:10.735 --> 15:12.476
<i>Thirty thousand people</i>

15:12.607 --> 15:14.130
<i>protesting
at American pressure </i>

15:14.261 --> 15:15.915
<i>upon Costa Rica to abandon</i>

15:16.045 --> 15:19.222
<i>its traditional position
of neutrality. </i>

15:19.353 --> 15:22.530
We sort of felt
an obligation to,

15:22.660 --> 15:25.402
you know, be reporting
on what was going on.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.710
But exposing
the illegal covert activities

15:28.840 --> 15:32.235
that the U.S.
was carrying out,

15:32.366 --> 15:35.717
I mean, it is
a dangerous story to cover.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.762
<i>In 1984,</i>

15:37.893 --> 15:40.591
<i>Tony Avrigan traveled
to the Nicaraguan jungle </i>

15:40.722 --> 15:43.116
<i>for a press conference led
by the southern Contra leader </i>

15:43.246 --> 15:44.291
<i>Eden Pastora.</i>

15:53.082 --> 15:55.084
<i>As the press conference
got under way... </i>

16:02.439 --> 16:04.093
<i>...a bomb went off.</i>

16:07.705 --> 16:10.708
<i>Seven people were killed...</i>

16:10.839 --> 16:12.710
<i>including three journalists.</i>

16:14.495 --> 16:17.628
<i>Tony was among the injured.</i>

16:17.759 --> 16:19.804
<i>It would later come out
the attack </i>

16:19.935 --> 16:22.329
<i>had been carried out
by a Sandinista sympathizer. </i>

16:26.289 --> 16:27.769
<i>As the reporting on the war</i>

16:27.899 --> 16:29.727
<i>and drug trafficking
progressed, </i>

16:29.858 --> 16:31.773
<i>Martha and Tony felt like</i>

16:31.903 --> 16:33.949
<i>they were being watched
and threatened. </i>

16:34.080 --> 16:36.386
We were out one day,
and we came back,

16:36.517 --> 16:38.214
and our files
had been gone through

16:38.345 --> 16:41.609
and were in a bit of chaos.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.437
We quickly learned
that someone

16:43.567 --> 16:47.571
sent down a CIA operative
to spy on us.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.834
Part of it was
to intimidate us.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.707
We would check under
our Jeep every day to see

16:52.837 --> 16:56.667
if there was a bomb
placed under it.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.321
The most scary incident

16:58.452 --> 16:59.801
was when we were mailed
a packet of cocaine

16:59.931 --> 17:02.369
and arrested
as drug traffickers.

17:02.499 --> 17:03.761
It was the DEA and the CIA

17:03.892 --> 17:06.242
that mailed us
a package of cocaine--

17:06.373 --> 17:08.201
two agents from there.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.987
It came in a package

17:12.118 --> 17:14.685
of two books
with a letter that said,

17:14.816 --> 17:16.296
"Tony and Martha,
here's a sample

17:16.426 --> 17:18.428
"of the latest shipment
of cocaine

17:18.559 --> 17:19.995
"that we want
to send up to Miami,

17:20.126 --> 17:21.562
"but we want you
to test it first to see

17:21.692 --> 17:22.650
if the quality is good enough."

17:22.780 --> 17:24.869
And the next day,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.655
there were stories
with photos of us saying,

17:27.785 --> 17:30.832
"Journalists arrested
as cocaine traffickers."

17:30.962 --> 17:33.313
It was awful, because
as you can imagine,

17:33.443 --> 17:35.793
you know,
all of our kids' friends,

17:35.924 --> 17:38.361
their parents wouldn't send
them to play with our kids.

17:38.492 --> 17:43.366
I mean, how do you prove
that you're not a trafficker?

17:43.497 --> 17:46.587
We had been
for such a long time

17:46.717 --> 17:49.894
uncovering these things
that the rest of the world

17:50.025 --> 17:53.376
was denying or the
State Department was denying.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.031
And eventually what
began to happen was for us

17:56.162 --> 17:57.989
and a couple
of other journalists,

17:58.120 --> 18:00.383
the U.S. officials
began calling

18:00.514 --> 18:03.212
whenever we were reporting
and say,

18:03.343 --> 18:04.822
"This is not correct.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.563
"What they are reporting
is not correct.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.175
You should not be using them.
You should fire them."

18:09.305 --> 18:12.569
<i>For several years,
Oliver North and his cohort </i>

18:12.700 --> 18:14.963
<i>had been successful in keeping
their covert activities </i>

18:15.094 --> 18:17.444
<i>out of American media.</i>

18:19.881 --> 18:21.491
And one day,
I, you know,

18:21.622 --> 18:22.884
remember turning
on the television,

18:23.014 --> 18:25.930
and this big kind
of disheveled American

18:26.061 --> 18:28.498
being led out
by these little Nicaraguans.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.761
I mean, this was
the smoking gun.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.851
<i>Eugene Hasenfus,
an American from Wisconsin, </i>

18:33.982 --> 18:36.506
<i>was walked out of the jungle
in southern Nicaragua today. </i>

18:36.637 --> 18:38.552
<i>His captors,
Nicaraguan soldiers, </i>

18:38.682 --> 18:39.944
<i>claim they shot down
a cargo plane </i>

18:40.075 --> 18:42.033
<i>carrying the American
and three others </i>

18:42.164 --> 18:44.340
<i>with a Soviet made
surface-to-air missile. </i>

18:44.471 --> 18:46.125
My name is Gene Hasenfus.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.651
Marinette, Wisconsin.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.919
I was shot out of the sky.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.532
<i>
In October of 1986, </i>

19:02.663 --> 19:04.621
<i>a story broke out of Nicaragua</i>

19:04.752 --> 19:06.449
<i>that made
the Reagan administration's </i>

19:06.580 --> 19:08.930
<i>military alliance
with the Contras hard to deny. </i>

19:11.802 --> 19:12.803
Eugene Hasenfus

19:12.934 --> 19:14.892
really was a soldier
of fortune.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.982
He managed to get recruited

19:18.113 --> 19:21.899
to work on one
of these airplanes

19:22.030 --> 19:26.600
and airdrop weapons
to the Contras.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.123
These planes,
they were perfect

19:28.254 --> 19:33.128
for airdropping
pallets of equipment

19:33.259 --> 19:35.739
because they flew
relatively slowly.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.480
The drawback, of course,

19:37.611 --> 19:40.222
was that these planes
flew low and flew slow.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.920
That made them easier targets
for Sandinista gunners.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.911
<i>
Amid the smoldering gear, </i>

20:17.041 --> 20:20.871
<i>the Sandinistas found the
bodies of Hasenfus's team-- </i>

20:21.002 --> 20:23.439
<i>two American pilots
and their radio man, </i>

20:23.570 --> 20:26.964
<i>a 17-year-old Nicaraguan boy.</i>

20:27.095 --> 20:29.880
<i>The next day,
deep in the jungle, </i>

20:30.011 --> 20:32.709
<i>a group of soldiers found
Hasenfus asleep in a hammock </i>

20:32.840 --> 20:34.755
<i>that he had made
out of his parachute. </i>

20:41.240 --> 20:42.893
All of a sudden,

20:43.024 --> 20:46.854
we had an American prisoner
of war in Nicaragua

20:46.984 --> 20:50.553
in a war we weren't
even supposed to be fighting.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.121
I was staffing
the CBS office in Nicaragua.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.255
And I remember
the Sandinista press officials

20:56.385 --> 20:58.561
coming over to me and saying,
"What do we do with this guy?"

21:02.739 --> 21:04.741
<i>The Sandinistas
paraded their new hostage </i>

21:04.872 --> 21:06.830
<i>in front of the press.</i>

21:11.226 --> 21:13.707
And he was captured around
noon on Monday the sixth.

21:15.012 --> 21:15.926
Thank you.

21:18.581 --> 21:19.756
<i>
For the first time, </i>

21:19.887 --> 21:21.584
<i>the government made public</i>

21:21.715 --> 21:23.934
<i>sensitive documents found
in the crash. </i>

21:24.065 --> 21:26.241
<i>Until now, the Sandinistas
have kept secret </i>

21:26.372 --> 21:28.809
<i>that among the papers
in the plane </i>

21:28.939 --> 21:31.942
<i>was a list of 13 Contra pilots
and their code names. </i>

21:41.909 --> 21:45.565
The objectives of our flights
into Nicaragua

21:45.695 --> 21:49.220
were to resupply the Contras.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.180
He started singing
like a robin.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.878
Of course, that led to the--

21:55.009 --> 21:57.794
to the whole story
coming apart.

21:59.492 --> 22:03.713
<i>Hasenfus says he
was working for the CIA. </i>

22:03.844 --> 22:06.368
He told an amazing story,

22:06.499 --> 22:09.763
which was that he was told
not to wear a parachute

22:09.893 --> 22:12.722
and that everybody on the planes
was told not to wear parachutes

22:12.853 --> 22:16.160
because they wanted them to die
if the plane was shot down

22:16.291 --> 22:18.685
so that they wouldn't live
to be able to testify.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.647
<i>Nearly every day,
Sandinista soldiers drill </i>

22:24.778 --> 22:26.170
<i>in Managua
and throughout the country </i>

22:26.301 --> 22:28.085
<i>to prepare themselves
for the American invasion </i>

22:28.216 --> 22:30.044
<i>they've long been predicting,</i>

22:30.174 --> 22:33.047
<i>an invasion they say is
symbolized by Eugene Hasenfus. </i>

23:06.472 --> 23:09.518
I'm glad you asked.
Absolutely none.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.392
<i>
As Reagan's team continued </i>

23:13.522 --> 23:16.438
<i>to deny their involvement
in the Contra War, </i>

23:16.569 --> 23:19.049
<i>the American media had
more questions than answers. </i>

23:21.487 --> 23:24.881
<i>
Who is Eugene Hasenfus? </i>

23:25.012 --> 23:26.666
<i>
No one seems to know anything </i>

23:26.796 --> 23:28.363
<i>about it
in Marinette, Wisconsin, </i>

23:28.494 --> 23:30.017
<i>the town along
the Green Bay shore </i>

23:30.147 --> 23:32.280
<i>where Eugene Hasenfus lives.</i>

23:32.411 --> 23:35.370
<i>He grew up here, played on

23:35.501 --> 23:37.720
<i>He and his wife, Sally,

23:37.851 --> 23:40.244
<i>live in this lakeside house
just outside town. </i>

23:40.375 --> 23:42.812
<i>We know he is
an American citizen, </i>

23:42.943 --> 23:45.815
<i>an ex-marine, a soldier
of fortune in the Vietnam War, </i>

23:45.946 --> 23:47.295
<i>and we know

<i>was shot down over Nicaragua.</i>

23:49.515 --> 23:51.734
<i>Hasenfus's father

23:51.865 --> 23:53.649
<i>Eugene was

<i>but he did leave town
five months ago. </i>

23:56.043 --> 23:58.349
All's I know is that
he was going to Florida

23:58.480 --> 24:00.090
to go to work,
construction work.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.049
And that's all
I know on that part.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.006
<i>
Eugene's brother, Bill, </i>

24:03.137 --> 24:04.921
<i>got a different version.</i>

24:05.052 --> 24:06.923
He said he got a job
with an air transport outfit

24:07.054 --> 24:09.709
out of Miami hauling cargo.

24:09.839 --> 24:13.495
His basing job was
a loadmaster, a crew chief.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.845
<i>The two brothers
often skydive together. </i>

24:15.976 --> 24:19.762
<i>The last time Bill saw
his brother was Labor Day... </i>

24:19.893 --> 24:22.373
<i>when Eugene borrowed
a parachute from him. </i>

24:25.942 --> 24:29.772
Reagan! Reagan!
Reagan! Reagan! Reagan!

24:29.903 --> 24:31.818
<i>The confusion seemed
to inspire the press </i>

24:31.948 --> 24:33.472
<i>to uncover the truth.</i>

24:33.602 --> 24:37.301
<i>With the midterms less
than a month away... </i>

24:37.432 --> 24:39.565
<i>the Reagan administration
needed a cover story. </i>

24:45.135 --> 24:47.486
Mr. Secretary, can you
give me categorical assurance

24:47.616 --> 24:49.357
that Hasenfus was not
under the control,

24:49.488 --> 24:52.360
the guidance, the direction
or what have you

24:52.491 --> 24:54.884
of anybody connected
with the American government?

24:55.015 --> 24:57.104
Absolutely.
That would be illegal.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.367
We are barred from doing that,
and we are not doing it.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.196
This was not in any sense a U.S.
government operation. None.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.416
<i>Members of
the National Security Council </i>

25:05.547 --> 25:08.985
<i>held a meeting in order
to coordinate a response. </i>

25:09.116 --> 25:10.421
<i>According to notes taken</i>

25:10.552 --> 25:12.815
<i>by one of the officials
present that day, </i>

25:12.946 --> 25:14.817
<i>the decision was made
to ask the Contras </i>

25:14.948 --> 25:17.690
<i>to assume responsibility
for the flight. </i>

25:17.820 --> 25:19.735
<i>The Contras agreed.</i>

25:19.866 --> 25:23.086
This is a private effort,

25:23.217 --> 25:25.785
and in no way is it
an effort of a government

25:25.915 --> 25:27.874
or of any agency
of this government.

25:29.919 --> 25:30.920
<i>
The White House insisted </i>

25:31.051 --> 25:32.356
<i>that Hasenfus was a lone pilot</i>

25:32.487 --> 25:34.402
<i>working for a private company</i>

25:34.533 --> 25:37.536
<i>supplying arms to the Contras,
end of story. </i>

25:39.407 --> 25:41.017
Do you feel
more optimistic

25:41.148 --> 25:43.063
than you did a few days ago
now that you've had a chance

25:43.193 --> 25:45.805
to talk both to the defense
attorney and with your husband?

25:45.935 --> 25:47.328
I won't feel
completely optimistic

25:47.458 --> 25:49.112
until I get him home.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.374
<i>
Last night, in prison, </i>

25:50.505 --> 25:52.986
<i>Gene Hasenfus
signaled his irritation </i>

25:53.116 --> 25:55.379
<i>at being continually forced
by his captors </i>

25:55.510 --> 25:57.251
<i>to answer questions
in public. </i>

25:57.381 --> 25:59.253
What do I think
about right now?

25:59.383 --> 26:02.082
I don't like sitting here.
I don't even want to be here.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.823
No.

26:03.953 --> 26:06.086
I've been bounced around
to these rooms

26:06.216 --> 26:09.306
in front of lights and cameras
so much, you can't believe.

26:09.437 --> 26:13.180
And it's--I'm not used to it,
and I don't care for it.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.878
<i>
Hasenfus, it turned out, </i>

26:16.009 --> 26:18.402
<i>was the one hostage
in the story of Iran-Contra </i>

26:18.533 --> 26:22.102
<i>whom Reagan didn't seem
interested in saving. </i>

26:22.232 --> 26:24.234
<i>But then a news report
came out </i>

26:24.365 --> 26:27.237
<i>linking the resupply operation
back to Oliver North. </i>

26:30.763 --> 26:32.373
Hasenfus and the
people he was working for

26:32.503 --> 26:34.375
had not been
especially careful

26:34.505 --> 26:37.117
in covering their tracks.

26:37.247 --> 26:40.555
And reporters were able to get
all of the phone records

26:40.686 --> 26:42.818
of the safe house
that Eugene Hasenfus

26:42.949 --> 26:44.907
had been seen at.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.823
And that included phone calls
to Ollie North's office.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.438
We've got some people,

26:54.569 --> 26:56.440
perhaps in
the National Security Council

26:56.571 --> 26:59.574
who have been watching
too many Rambo movies.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.403
I personally believe
it's imperative that we hear

27:02.533 --> 27:04.274
from the National
Security Council.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.276
I think we need to hear
from Mr. Oliver North

27:06.407 --> 27:09.062
under oath.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.454
It felt a little bit
like Watergate,

27:10.585 --> 27:13.022
that moment in Watergate

27:13.153 --> 27:14.894
when all of a sudden
you realize

27:15.024 --> 27:18.201
this is a bigger story
than we realized.

27:18.332 --> 27:21.944
A CIA operation,
a CIA-operated plane,

27:22.075 --> 27:25.034
CIA-paid people
were caught red-handed.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.472
Sorry to trouble you, sir.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.952
Could you just tell us
what the press--

27:30.083 --> 27:31.214
Why don't you go back home
where you belong?

27:31.345 --> 27:32.259
Yes.
Could you tell us, sir,

27:32.389 --> 27:33.608
what has happened to the money?

27:33.739 --> 27:35.175
All kinds of people called me--

27:35.305 --> 27:38.439
North, McFarlane, etcetera.

27:38.569 --> 27:41.050
And the whole thing
just started to unravel.

27:41.181 --> 27:44.053
My front yard was filled
with reporters

27:44.184 --> 27:47.927
faster than you
can say your name.

27:48.057 --> 27:51.452
Why were they dealing directly
with Oliver North?

27:51.582 --> 27:53.889
Where was this money
coming from?

27:54.020 --> 27:55.499
Who had paid for the airplane?

27:55.630 --> 27:56.936
Who had paid for the shipment?

28:01.462 --> 28:03.116
And the biggest question,

28:03.246 --> 28:04.247
the overarching question,
of course, was--

28:04.378 --> 28:06.336
how deeply was

28:06.467 --> 28:08.164
the Reagan administration
involved in this?

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
<i>
Up until this point, </i>

28:14.867 --> 28:17.608
<i>Project Democracy
had yet to encounter a problem </i>

28:17.739 --> 28:20.524
<i>that couldn't be fixed
with a bit of PR. </i>

28:20.655 --> 28:23.397
When the airplane went down

28:23.527 --> 28:25.529
that contained arms

28:25.660 --> 28:28.054
that were intended
for the Contras,

28:28.184 --> 28:30.534
it basically proved the case

28:30.665 --> 28:34.495
that we had every right
to be concerned

28:34.625 --> 28:37.628
that the administration
was doing something

28:37.759 --> 28:40.066
violating
the Boland Amendment.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.938
That has always been something
that the White House

28:43.069 --> 28:45.071
says will never happen.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.073
And yet it happened yesterday

28:47.203 --> 28:49.292
with three Americans dying.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.947
This city is awash with rumor,

28:52.078 --> 28:54.558
intrigue, treachery.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.560
Laws have been broken.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.693
At the very center
of the White House,

28:58.824 --> 29:02.871
there has been the most
unbelievable revelations.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.268
The number of times
that Oliver North's superiors

29:08.398 --> 29:11.314
were called up
to the subcommittee

29:11.445 --> 29:14.361
to testify about news reports

29:14.491 --> 29:16.406
that they were secretly
resupplying the Contras

29:16.537 --> 29:18.669
in violation
of congressional law.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.411
And they just falsified
the testimony.

29:21.542 --> 29:24.284
They lied again
and again and again.

29:24.414 --> 29:28.027
What you realize is that

29:28.157 --> 29:31.682
people are operating
on their own

29:31.813 --> 29:36.470
without any kind
of supervision,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.951
without any kind
of rule of law.

29:41.518 --> 29:45.000
Basically,
you're dealing with,

29:45.131 --> 29:48.787
you know, a group that feels

29:48.917 --> 29:51.050
it's licensed to do
whatever the hell they want.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.664
The curtain had
really been pulled back

29:56.795 --> 29:59.580
on these illegal operations,

29:59.710 --> 30:02.452
and the scandal
literally started

30:02.583 --> 30:04.715
to unravel right there.

30:04.846 --> 30:08.154
And then
just a couple weeks later,

30:08.284 --> 30:10.286
the Iran side of it escalated.

30:47.062 --> 30:50.065
<i>Just weeks after the
Hasenfus crash in Nicaragua, </i>

30:50.196 --> 30:53.590
<i>two operatives from Iran
arrived in Beirut. </i>

30:53.721 --> 30:55.288
<i>They were on a secret mission</i>

30:55.418 --> 30:56.985
<i>to find
a trustworthy journalist </i>

30:57.116 --> 30:58.247
<i>and leak him a story.</i>

31:03.949 --> 31:06.473
<i>The operatives knew
Hassan Sabra </i>

31:06.603 --> 31:08.475
<i>was a supporter
of the Iranian Revolution. </i>

32:30.861 --> 32:32.689
<i>Sabra's magazine,
Ash-Shiraa,</i>

32:32.820 --> 32:36.389
<i>had been reporting
on the Iran-Iraq war for years. </i>

32:36.519 --> 32:38.782
<i>Iraq's
190,000-man army </i>

32:38.913 --> 32:41.437
<i>has been lavishly equipped
by the Soviet Union. </i>

32:41.568 --> 32:43.744
For the Iraqi,
it is a conventional war.

32:43.874 --> 32:46.703
For the Iranians,
it is nonconventional.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.272
It is guerrilla warfare.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.708
<i>Responding
to the Ayatollah's call, </i>

32:51.839 --> 32:53.406
<i>thousands of young Iranians</i>

32:53.536 --> 32:55.582
<i>have taken up arms
against the Iraqis. </i>

32:55.712 --> 32:57.584
<i>It is these amateur soldiers</i>

32:57.714 --> 32:59.325
<i>who will have
the job of trying </i>

32:59.455 --> 33:03.851
<i>to break through the lines
of Iraqi tanks and guns. </i>

33:03.982 --> 33:06.332
<i>For years,
Iran had been holding its own </i>

33:06.462 --> 33:07.986
<i>in the conflict,</i>

33:08.116 --> 33:09.465
<i>but in recent months,
something had shifted. </i>

33:09.596 --> 33:11.293
<i>It seemed to Sabra</i>

33:11.424 --> 33:13.121
<i>that Iran had gained
a decisive advantage. </i>

33:29.094 --> 33:31.400
<i>The men from Tehran
who had shown up </i>

33:31.531 --> 33:34.969
<i>at Hassan Sabra's office
seemed to have an explanation. </i>

33:35.100 --> 33:37.232
<i>They told him
that representatives </i>

33:37.363 --> 33:39.278
<i>of the Reagan White House
had been in Iran </i>

33:39.408 --> 33:42.020
<i>to negotiate
an unthinkable deal. </i>

34:01.517 --> 34:03.302
And it was
a really good story.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.608
I mean, all kinds
of journalistic bells

34:05.739 --> 34:07.523
started ringing in my head.

34:07.654 --> 34:08.872
I said, "This is a scoop.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.352
I have got
to write this story."

34:12.572 --> 34:15.749
It was so outlandish,
you know,

34:15.879 --> 34:17.838
the key and the cake
and the Bible

34:17.968 --> 34:23.322
and the fact that it was
the Reagan administration.

34:23.452 --> 34:24.758
You know, we were cut off
from what was going on

34:24.888 --> 34:26.673
in the rest of the world.

34:26.803 --> 34:30.024
There was no electricity,
so we didn't watch CNN a lot.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.896
So this was really
a newsmaker for me.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.724
This was a scoop.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.697
I think
I may have called him

34:50.827 --> 34:52.438
when I was writing the story.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.962
I wanted to see if there was
a story behind the story.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.398
And, actually, there was.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.770
For me, working
for an American newspaper,

35:20.901 --> 35:23.382
it was,
"Wow, you know, this puts

35:23.512 --> 35:25.166
the administration
on the spot."

35:25.297 --> 35:28.517
And there were all these
contradictory things, you know.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.171
The Americans were going
around the world

35:30.302 --> 35:33.696
telling Europe and others,
"Don't sell weapons to Iran,"

35:33.827 --> 35:35.785
yet they were doing it.

35:35.916 --> 35:39.354
And the fact that it was
so intimately involved

35:39.485 --> 35:42.401
with the fate
of the hostages.

35:42.531 --> 35:46.100
So it was this tapestry
of intrigue.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.494
I was investigating
all of this stuff.

35:48.624 --> 35:52.672
I was talking to people
I knew in the government.

35:52.802 --> 35:54.108
And even they told me

35:54.239 --> 35:56.197
they couldn't put
the pieces together.

35:56.328 --> 36:01.376
So none of us quite got
to the nub of the matter until,

36:01.507 --> 36:03.552
to our shame as journalists,

36:03.683 --> 36:06.294
a Lebanese magazine
called <i>Ash-Shiraa</i>

36:06.425 --> 36:08.601
got a terrific scoop.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.342
I wrote
a really detailed story,

36:10.472 --> 36:11.952
and my foreign editor,

36:12.082 --> 36:13.823
who was friends
with Bud McFarlane,

36:13.954 --> 36:15.347
called him up and said,

36:15.477 --> 36:16.696
"I want you to be honest
with me.

36:16.826 --> 36:19.829
Were you in Tehran
in September?"

36:19.960 --> 36:22.180
And McFarlane said, "No."

36:22.310 --> 36:24.747
It had all the other details
of the story.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.707
But, in fact,
he had gone to Iran in May.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.492
So they played down the story.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.625
There have been reports
that you were carrying a cake

36:32.755 --> 36:34.888
that was shaped like a key,
that you were carrying a Bible,

36:35.018 --> 36:36.672
that you took
personal revolvers

36:36.803 --> 36:38.370
for Rafsanjani as well.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.806
Any parts
of those reports true?

36:41.590 --> 36:42.722
Tom, you know me
better than that.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.811
I don't do business
that way.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.595
And then Rafsanjani

36:46.726 --> 36:48.510
gave a press conference
in Tehran

36:48.641 --> 36:50.904
in which he detailed

36:51.034 --> 36:53.689
the story, you know,
how they had met

36:53.820 --> 36:57.606
and the key and the cake
and the whole enchilada.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.434
We were told that

36:59.565 --> 37:02.176
he was carrying some pistol

37:02.307 --> 37:07.964
for the individual authorities
in Iran

37:08.095 --> 37:09.662
and a cake.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.969
It was the most important
scoop that year.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.537
The whole world
paid attention to it.

37:17.626 --> 37:21.282
When the story broke
about our trip,

37:21.413 --> 37:24.851
my wife and I were actually
celebrating her birthday,

37:24.981 --> 37:27.070
and we had just finished
a wonderful dinner

37:27.201 --> 37:29.203
when I got paged--

37:29.334 --> 37:32.032
we still had pagers
in those days--

37:32.162 --> 37:33.990
by the White House
Situation Room

37:34.121 --> 37:37.907
to tell me
about the <i>Ash-Shiraa</i> story

37:38.038 --> 37:40.214
that revealed
that a U.S. delegation

37:40.345 --> 37:43.913
had come to Iran
to try to, you know,

37:44.044 --> 37:46.742
bring about the release
of the hostages,

37:46.873 --> 37:49.484
and we had brought a cake
in the shape of a key

37:49.615 --> 37:51.965
and other things
that weren't quite accurate.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.793
But enough of it was true

37:53.923 --> 37:57.187
so that I immediately
understood

37:57.318 --> 38:01.148
that the future was going to be
very different for my life.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.802
That these were

38:02.932 --> 38:05.283
straight
"arms for hostage" swaps

38:05.413 --> 38:07.589
immediately set off a storm
in Washington

38:07.720 --> 38:11.071
because that was not the policy
of the United States.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.029
It was a policy
that Ronald Reagan

38:13.160 --> 38:14.814
and his secretary of state,
George Shultz,

38:14.944 --> 38:16.685
had said
they would not follow.

38:16.816 --> 38:19.166
It would have been
illegal to do it.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.733
So what was this about?

38:20.863 --> 38:22.735
Could I suggest an appeal
to all of you

38:22.865 --> 38:24.171
in regard to this,
that the speculation,

38:24.302 --> 38:26.042
the commenting and all?

38:26.173 --> 38:28.915
On a story that came out
of the Middle East,

38:29.045 --> 38:31.657
it has no foundation,

38:31.787 --> 38:34.312
that all of that is making it
more difficult for us

38:34.442 --> 38:37.010
in our efforts to get
the other hostages freed.

38:39.447 --> 38:43.016
You could be clever
with your words and say,

38:43.146 --> 38:45.453
"Yeah, we weren't really
negotiating with terrorists,"

38:45.584 --> 38:48.326
but, effectively, we were.

38:48.456 --> 38:51.807
We negotiated with Israel
to help Israel decide

38:51.938 --> 38:54.244
to do something
that terrorists wanted,

38:54.375 --> 38:57.378
and then the terrorists
did what they said

38:57.509 --> 38:59.815
they were going to do
and released those hostages.

38:59.946 --> 39:02.035
So sometimes it worked,

39:02.165 --> 39:04.124
and violence was averted.

39:04.254 --> 39:05.821
And sometimes it didn't.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.084
And as far as Weinberger

39:08.215 --> 39:09.608
and Secretary Shultz
were concerned,

39:09.738 --> 39:11.305
we were dealing
with terrorists,

39:11.436 --> 39:13.960
and it made them
very uncomfortable.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.616
When the news broke,

39:17.746 --> 39:19.922
we were getting
onto Air Force One,

39:20.053 --> 39:22.882
and a correspondent
shouted to Reagan

39:23.012 --> 39:25.537
a question about Bud McFarlane

39:25.667 --> 39:28.104
going to Iran--

39:28.235 --> 39:30.672
and could you comment on it?

39:30.803 --> 39:32.848
And Reagan did not
answer the question.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.158
<i>
November 4, 1986 </i>

39:38.288 --> 39:41.335
<i>was not a good day
for Ronald Reagan. </i>

39:41.466 --> 39:42.771
Good evening.
Virtually all the polls

39:42.902 --> 39:44.730
have closed
in all of the states now.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.732
And what we know at this hour
is that the Democrats

39:46.862 --> 39:49.604
have taken control
of the United States Senate,

39:49.735 --> 39:52.781
and it may be by
a significantly larger margin

39:52.912 --> 39:55.393
than even they had anticipated
in their wildest hopes.

39:55.523 --> 39:57.003
Well, Jane, clearly
the new numbers

39:57.133 --> 39:58.134
mean it's going to be
a different ball game

39:58.265 --> 39:59.832
for President Ronald Reagan

39:59.962 --> 40:01.703
from here on through
the end of his term.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.401
Standing by in our
Washington studios this morning

40:03.531 --> 40:05.228
is White House Chief
of Staff Donald Regan.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.883
- Good morning, Mr. Regan.
- Good morning, Bryant.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.885
<i>In spite
of his campaign blitz, </i>

40:10.016 --> 40:12.061
<i>the president had failed
to inspire the nation </i>

40:12.192 --> 40:14.934
<i>to keep the Senate
on his side. </i>

40:15.064 --> 40:17.850
<i>For the first time
in his six years as president, </i>

40:17.980 --> 40:19.634
<i>Reagan would be working
with a Congress </i>

40:19.765 --> 40:21.984
<i>under Democratic control.</i>

40:22.115 --> 40:23.682
Wasn't this, Mr. Regan,

40:23.812 --> 40:25.205
a personal rebuff
for the president?

40:25.335 --> 40:26.685
I mean, we can run down
the laundry list,

40:26.815 --> 40:27.816
and, frankly,
it looks pretty bad.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.429
<i>To make matters worse
for Reagan, </i>

40:31.559 --> 40:34.127
<i>the press would not let up
on the Iran story. </i>

40:42.135 --> 40:43.789
The White House scrambled

40:43.919 --> 40:45.791
to get on top of the story,
but they had a problem.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.968
Very few of them knew
exactly what had gone on.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.752
But there were
plenty of officials

40:50.883 --> 40:54.016
who wanted to jump in
and control the story.

40:54.147 --> 40:56.628
And so officials
began telling stories

40:56.758 --> 40:58.325
that conflicted
with each other.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.980
They told stories that didn't
make sense internally.

41:01.110 --> 41:03.243
We rather quickly
came to realize

41:03.373 --> 41:05.158
there is something
seriously amiss.

41:07.290 --> 41:09.249
<i>
In November of 1986, </i>

41:09.379 --> 41:11.904
<i>the president once again
hosted a ceremony </i>

41:12.034 --> 41:15.429
<i>in the White House Rose Garden
for a recently released hostage. </i>

41:15.560 --> 41:17.475
<i>By now, this was
a familiar ritual. </i>

41:30.792 --> 41:32.315
<i>Unlike the other ceremonies,</i>

41:32.446 --> 41:34.970
<i>this one was occurring
amid a very public scandal </i>

41:35.101 --> 41:38.974
<i>about covert arms sales
to a terrorist country. </i>

41:39.105 --> 41:40.802
Mr. President,
the Iranians are saying

41:40.933 --> 41:42.369
that if you'll release
some of those weapons,

41:42.500 --> 41:44.763
they'll intercede to free
the rest of the hostages.

41:44.893 --> 41:45.981
Will you?

41:57.384 --> 41:58.951
<i>The White House's</i>

41:59.081 --> 42:00.779
<i>awkward public attempts
at evasion </i>

42:00.909 --> 42:03.172
<i>only added
to the press's interest. </i>

42:03.303 --> 42:04.913
I'm not supposed
to take questions,

42:05.044 --> 42:07.350
but I will answer
that one, Sam.

42:07.481 --> 42:10.832
At00 tonight, tune in,
and you'll hear all.

42:10.963 --> 42:13.879
<i>And so, on the
evening of November 13th, </i>

42:14.009 --> 42:16.272
<i>Reagan delivered his first
full public statement </i>

42:16.403 --> 42:18.884
<i>on the Iranian arms deal.</i>

42:19.014 --> 42:20.450
Good evening.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.235
I know you've been
reading, seeing,

42:22.365 --> 42:24.280
and hearing a lot of stories
the past several days.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.544
A charge has been made
that the United States

42:26.674 --> 42:29.547
has shipped weapons
to Iran as ransom payment

42:29.677 --> 42:32.419
for the release of
American hostages in Lebanon,

42:32.550 --> 42:34.508
that the United States
undercut its allies

42:34.639 --> 42:37.206
and secretly violated
American policy

42:37.337 --> 42:39.818
against trafficking
with terrorists.

42:39.948 --> 42:43.604
Those charges
are utterly false.

42:43.735 --> 42:45.475
<i>Relying on the
advice of his trusted aide, </i>

42:45.606 --> 42:48.130
<i>John Poindexter,
Reagan insisted </i>

42:48.261 --> 42:49.958
<i>that what the White House
had done </i>

42:50.089 --> 42:52.352
<i>was consistent
with their policy. </i>

42:52.482 --> 42:55.616
There's a saying
in Arabic that,

42:55.747 --> 42:59.141
"They're not doing it for
the blackness of your eyes,"

42:59.272 --> 43:01.361
you know,
or the beauty of your eyes.

43:01.491 --> 43:04.146
There's some other interest,
some other agenda.

43:04.277 --> 43:05.583
...those who commit
terrorist acts...

43:05.713 --> 43:08.586
It signaled to me
that, in politics,

43:08.716 --> 43:11.153
there is no idealism,
there are no ideals.

43:11.284 --> 43:12.981
There are interests.

43:13.112 --> 43:15.375
Sometimes they intersect.

43:15.505 --> 43:19.205
And what is expedient
is the policy of the day.

43:23.296 --> 43:25.124
Good evening.

43:25.254 --> 43:28.127
This is the <i>CBS Evening News,
Dan Rather reporting.</i>

43:28.257 --> 43:31.173
A new <i>Los Angeles Times</i> poll
just released indicates

43:31.304 --> 43:34.220
only 14% of the American people

43:34.350 --> 43:36.875
believe what President Reagan
has told them

43:37.005 --> 43:39.007
about his weapons deals
with Iran.

43:39.138 --> 43:42.010
He obviously designed
the 12 minutes

43:42.141 --> 43:46.928
to mislead
or to sort of obfuscate.

43:47.059 --> 43:48.147
And Ronald Reagan
doesn't come off very well

43:48.277 --> 43:49.931
when he does that.

43:50.062 --> 43:53.935
I still feel strongly
as a White House watcher

43:54.066 --> 43:55.197
that the most important
thing to them was,

43:55.328 --> 43:56.938
the heck with policy,

43:57.069 --> 43:59.027
let's get these hostages
home before the election.

44:01.073 --> 44:02.944
<i>
The speech was widely regarded </i>

44:03.075 --> 44:04.293
<i>as a disaster
for the president. </i>

44:05.773 --> 44:09.516
<i>I certainly wasn't excited
about his performance. </i>

44:09.647 --> 44:13.563
<i>I thought that it was not
a good explanation </i>

44:13.694 --> 44:17.002
<i>of all that
we were trying to do. </i>

44:17.132 --> 44:20.658
<i>It concerned me
because I began to realize </i>

44:20.788 --> 44:23.443
<i>that the president
wasn't going to be able </i>

44:23.573 --> 44:27.142
<i>to explain this well
to the American people. </i>

44:27.273 --> 44:28.927
<i>
It was a watershed moment </i>

44:29.057 --> 44:31.103
<i>in the Iran-Contra affair.</i>

44:31.233 --> 44:33.279
<i>Reagan had now
publicly adopted </i>

44:33.409 --> 44:36.151
<i>an inaccurate version
of events, </i>

44:36.282 --> 44:38.676
<i>and not only did the public
think he was lying, </i>

44:38.806 --> 44:40.416
<i>some members
of his own administration </i>

44:40.547 --> 44:41.940
<i>were losing confidence, too.</i>

44:44.812 --> 44:48.033
<i>Soon, Secretary of State
George Shultz, </i>

44:48.163 --> 44:51.079
<i>who had always opposed
the weapons sales to Iran, </i>

44:51.210 --> 44:53.081
<i>gave an interview that
revealed the power struggle </i>

44:53.212 --> 44:55.605
<i>going on within the White House.</i>

44:55.736 --> 44:57.477
<i>I had not been
willing to go </i>

44:57.607 --> 44:59.653
<i>on any of the shows
or whatever. </i>

44:59.784 --> 45:03.352
<i>And then I was told
that a decision had been made </i>

45:03.483 --> 45:06.007
<i>to stop all arms sales.</i>

45:06.138 --> 45:08.662
<i>So I agreed to go
on Face the Nation.</i>

45:08.793 --> 45:12.274
<i>And as I was getting ready
to go over to the studio </i>

45:12.405 --> 45:14.320
<i>on a Sunday morning,</i>

45:14.450 --> 45:16.496
<i>I was told the decision
had changed </i>

45:16.626 --> 45:19.107
<i>and arms sales
were gonna continue. </i>

45:19.238 --> 45:21.719
<i>But I was on the hook to go.</i>

45:21.849 --> 45:24.156
<i>So Lesley,
toward the end of her show, </i>

45:24.286 --> 45:26.245
<i>said...</i>

45:26.375 --> 45:28.638
I'll ask it again--will there
be any more arms shipments

45:28.769 --> 45:31.119
to Iran, either directly
by the United States

45:31.250 --> 45:33.339
or through any third parties?

45:33.469 --> 45:36.516
Under the circumstances
of Iran's war with Iraq,

45:36.646 --> 45:38.561
its pursuit of terrorism,

45:38.692 --> 45:41.347
its association with those
holding our hostages,

45:41.477 --> 45:45.133
I would certainly say,
as far as I'm concerned, no.

45:45.264 --> 45:47.266
Do you have
the authority to speak

45:47.396 --> 45:49.137
for the entire administration?

45:49.268 --> 45:50.486
No.

45:50.617 --> 45:53.402
<i>And I went back to my office</i>

45:53.533 --> 45:55.622
<i>and I told my staff,
"When I get back, </i>

45:55.753 --> 45:59.191
<i>I won't be
secretary of state anymore." </i>

45:59.321 --> 46:00.540
<i>
When the secretary of state </i>

46:00.670 --> 46:02.455
<i>goes public
with his lack of confidence </i>

46:02.585 --> 46:04.370
<i>and his disagreements
with the president, </i>

46:04.500 --> 46:06.589
<i>it is an unusual event
in Washington </i>

46:06.720 --> 46:09.288
<i>and a sign something
is deeply wrong. </i>

46:11.072 --> 46:12.552
I do have the sense

46:12.682 --> 46:15.033
that we are witnessing
the disintegration

46:15.163 --> 46:17.339
of this administration's
foreign policy.

46:17.470 --> 46:20.952
Your presidency is tottering.

46:21.082 --> 46:24.042
Do you realize this?

46:24.172 --> 46:27.785
It can be saved,
but only you can save it

46:27.915 --> 46:33.007
and only if you will talk
with us, the Congress.

46:33.138 --> 46:34.400
<i>And it seemed
that Congress </i>

46:34.530 --> 46:36.837
<i>now had plans of its own.</i>

46:36.968 --> 46:39.057
And in Congress, there
is a mixture of astonishment

46:39.187 --> 46:41.276
and outrage
in both parties tonight.

46:41.407 --> 46:44.453
NBC's John Dancy reports now
that there were accusations

46:44.584 --> 46:47.282
that the White House
had broken the law.

46:47.413 --> 46:50.764
It's like a very, very gigantic
jigsaw puzzle

46:50.895 --> 46:53.158
that's got a puzzle
on both sides

46:53.288 --> 46:55.247
and is three-dimensional.

46:55.377 --> 46:58.163
So if you don't have
great structural vision,

46:58.293 --> 46:59.642
you're gonna have--

46:59.773 --> 47:03.298
Yeah, a Rubik's cube
is a better example.

47:03.429 --> 47:05.083
You know,
it was too much for the press

47:05.213 --> 47:07.302
to try to uncover all of this.

47:07.433 --> 47:09.696
There needed to be
independent investigations.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.568
We needed the subpoena power

47:12.699 --> 47:15.702
that can come through
congressional investigations.

47:15.833 --> 47:19.140
<i>The administration
was awash in scandal. </i>

47:19.271 --> 47:21.186
<i>But the biggest
bombshell of all, </i>

47:21.316 --> 47:23.753
<i>the illegal diversion
of profits from the Iran deal </i>

47:23.884 --> 47:25.973
<i>to the Contras,
had yet to be discovered. </i>

47:27.714 --> 47:29.585
<i>Ronald Reagan,</i>

47:29.716 --> 47:32.371
<i>who was used to basking
in the glow of stage lights, </i>

47:32.501 --> 47:36.201
<i>suddenly found their glare
to be a little too bright. </i>

47:36.331 --> 47:39.465
<i>Meanwhile,
with investigations looming, </i>

47:39.595 --> 47:41.684
<i>one loyal foot soldier
was preparing himself </i>

47:41.815 --> 47:43.338
<i>to take the fall.</i>
