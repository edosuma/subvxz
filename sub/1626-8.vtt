00:01.101 --> 00:02.935
Thank you.

00:02.937 --> 00:05.938
That was, like,
our tenth gay guy tonight.

00:05.939 --> 00:10.009
Let's hope our gay buzz lasts
longer than adam lambert's.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.377
Oh, it will.
I'm all over it.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.279
And by "it," I mean
I'm all over grindr.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.948
Max, why are you
on that app?

00:15.950 --> 00:18.684
You're not a gay man
looking for anonymous sex.

00:18.686 --> 00:22.021
Don't put me in a box!

00:22.023 --> 00:24.123
You told me to find ways
to drum up business.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.624
Well, I'm drumming it up
by showing off

00:25.626 --> 00:28.460
This guy's "bid'ness."

00:28.462 --> 00:30.863
I pretended to be a rough
and ready puerto rican guy

00:30.865 --> 00:32.497
Who still likes to cuddle.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.034
That there's gay chum,
my friend.

00:36.336 --> 00:40.139
Ooh, I hooked a big one.
Get the net.

00:40.141 --> 00:44.510
Hi. Was a muscular
puerto rican guy just here?

00:44.512 --> 00:46.478
When is there not?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.747
Would you like to purchase
a delicious cupcake

00:48.749 --> 00:50.049
While you wait?

00:50.051 --> 00:52.718
Well, maybe,
while I wait.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.187
My phone says
he's right here.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.056
Here,
this is on the house,

00:57.058 --> 01:01.527
Because the muscular gay guy,
that's him.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.996
It's cool
that you're transitioning,

01:03.998 --> 01:07.166
But you really should let people
know you're not puerto rican.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.801
[mouthing words]

01:12.672 --> 01:14.039
Well....

01:14.041 --> 01:16.809

so I'm mad too.

Check.

01:34.028 --> 01:35.127

01:37.765 --> 01:39.231
Sorry I'm late.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.966
I was ten minutes early
for my shift,

01:40.968 --> 01:44.203
So I thought "well,
I have 20 minutes to kill,"

01:44.205 --> 01:46.472
And I wandered
into this cool surf shop

01:46.474 --> 01:48.240
And saw this guy
polishing a surfboard.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.075
A surfer here?

01:50.077 --> 01:51.610
You don't hang ten

I'm ain't gonna get eaten
by some shark.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.560
Ain't nobody got time
for that.

02:08.562 --> 02:13.499
The chances of you being bit
by a shark are, like, .0001%.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.801
Not if you're black.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.904
Sharks are racist as hell.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.640
That's why they call them
"great whites."

02:22.942 --> 02:25.077
Marc, the surfer, and I
really hit it off,

02:25.079 --> 02:27.913
And he is so cute, like
a young matthew mcconaughey,

02:27.915 --> 02:29.748
But with real hair.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.417
So nothing like
matthew mcconaughey.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.987
I hope he texts me.
I love surfing.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.356
I never go in the water, 'cause
I know if I start drowning,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.491
I'm not gonna fight it.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.093
When I used to summer
in st. Barths,

02:41.095 --> 02:43.195
There'd be these
sexy italian surfers,

02:43.197 --> 02:45.097
And they'd invite us
to sunbathe on their boards.

02:45.099 --> 02:48.367
I mean, they robbed us,
but it was amazing.

for that kind of guy,

02:51.172 --> 02:53.172
I have a cousin
who loves the water.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.609
Oh, sweet. No thanks.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.444
Well, think about it.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.280
You'll be at the front row
of every concert,

03:01.282 --> 03:05.150
And he doesn't move around a lot
when he sleeps.

03:05.152 --> 03:08.287
Here, give old ironside
my number.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.857
What? I love music,
and if he bugs me,

03:11.859 --> 03:14.960
The city has one of those
free vans that'll take him home.

Maybe give one.

Absolutely not, no.

04:18.024 --> 04:21.560

04:28.068 --> 04:30.068
Ooh, the "it" place!

04:30.070 --> 04:32.904
"let's have dinner
at the 'it' place."

04:32.906 --> 04:35.040
How come this isn't
the "it" place?

04:35.042 --> 04:39.878
This isn't an "it" place.
It's more of an "it" hole.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.449
Okay, so how do we
become an "it" place?

04:44.451 --> 04:48.053
First, burn the place down,
start fresh.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.821
Then you create hype
by making it

04:49.823 --> 04:51.256
Impossible to get
a reservation.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.891
You basically refuse
to let anyone in.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.002
Okay, I've put my date purse

and a $20 bill

05:05.506 --> 05:07.406
To make it seem
like I have money,

05:07.408 --> 05:08.674
Which I will return
to the register

05:08.676 --> 05:10.342

05:10.344 --> 05:12.010
Well, you're welcome
to use my date purse.

and a change of boxers.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.582
And my phone
is fully charged,

05:17.584 --> 05:19.751
So I can call an uber car
to take me home.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.119
An uber car?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.788
You can't afford
a fancy town car.

05:22.790 --> 05:26.191
Yesterday, you used
an english muffin to exfoliate.

05:26.193 --> 05:29.027
Yeah, and then I ate it.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.364
Plus, it's on our
joint credit card,

you make a dumb purchase,

You owe me a joint.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.026
But I didn't say you could
borrow my breasts.

chicken cutlets,

06:03.364 --> 06:04.663

and some tape.

of my talk show in poland.

Down here
and down there, so...

06:50.344 --> 06:52.744
So let's just say I'm very glad
that you're going on a date.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.547
Oh, and I got you
a little present.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.750

06:58.752 --> 07:00.385
Oh, that's so sweet, sophie.

07:00.387 --> 07:04.289
Yeah, and I got you
a big grab bag of condoms.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.791
I got all sizes.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.360
I got magnums,
I got super magnums,

07:08.362 --> 07:11.062
I got regular, and...

07:11.064 --> 07:13.865
"he's got
a great personality."

07:13.867 --> 07:15.100
Here you go.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.868
Usually,
a "great personality"

07:16.870 --> 07:19.638
Is the only birth control
I need.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.540
Thank you,
but I am a lady,

07:21.542 --> 07:22.974
And I won't be needing these
until our third date.

07:22.976 --> 07:27.245
Well, you better hurry up
and get dressed.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.114

I'm already dressed.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.250

07:32.252 --> 07:35.287
And I like
what I'm wearing.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.789
You do?

07:37.791 --> 07:42.494
Well, just put on
a little makeup.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.463

07:44.465 --> 07:46.465
You are?

07:46.467 --> 07:50.302
Oh, well, you know,
maybe when you do your hair.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.636
Okay, I'm a little behind
on my hair.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.905
My boobs were a bigger project
than I thought.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.441
And I like what I'm wearing,
and I don't have time to change

07:56.443 --> 07:57.909
'cause he's already
20 minutes late.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.412
20 minutes late?

08:00.414 --> 08:02.914
Wahh-wahh.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.816
That's a no-show.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.351
You've just got stood up.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.520
You got stood up
somethin' awful.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.923
I did not get stood up.
I've never been stood up.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.758
In fact, I wouldn't even know
if I was being stood up,

08:13.760 --> 08:15.427
Because that's how little
I know about being stood up.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.796
Am I being stood up?

08:17.798 --> 08:21.166
No, you are not.
Guys are always late.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.135
I once waited
three days for a guy.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.704
But he showed up
with the ransom money,

08:25.706 --> 08:28.840
And you don't see me
living in a fridge anymore.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.343
Okay, fine.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.477
Nobody got stood up.

08:33.480 --> 08:38.383
So I'll just sit here
and text while we wait...

08:38.385 --> 08:41.052
You know, forever.

08:42.488 --> 08:45.357
And then, finally,
when it dawns on you,

08:45.359 --> 08:49.628
We can call our friend oleg,
and he can go put a hit on him.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.996
You know what, maybe he thought
we were meeting there.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.464
I'm calling the restaurant
to see--

08:52.466 --> 08:55.467
Yes, hi, has a marc faison
checked in yet?

08:55.469 --> 08:57.502
He has not.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.071
What about now?

09:00.073 --> 09:01.706
It's just that he
was supposed--

09:01.708 --> 09:04.509
Well, I'm busy too.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.044
Don't be so snooty,

09:06.046 --> 09:08.580
You used to be
a hot dog on a stick.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.251
Just a heads up,
if he doesn't show,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.086
I'm still getting naked.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.489
[phone chimes]
ooh, there he is!

09:17.491 --> 09:19.491
No, it's from amazon.

09:19.493 --> 09:23.328
Someone's sending me a copy
of   <i>he's just not that into yo.</i>

09:31.370 --> 09:34.773
Yeah,
I'm here for you, <i>girl.</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:38.209
Well, I got stood up.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.511
Remember where you are, max.

09:39.513 --> 09:42.213
This was the day
caroline channing got stood up.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.416
Well, screw him
for standing you up.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.784
And from now on,
never trust a guy

09:45.786 --> 09:48.420
Who surfs anything
besides porn.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.064
Oh, look,
harlow and daughters

09:59.066 --> 10:02.634
Has a real old-timey,
general store kind of vibe.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.603
I guess they take
"throwback Thursday"

10:04.605 --> 10:06.471
Really seriously here.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.940
I mean, it's 1840.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.609
Yeah, I wanted to take you
back to a time

10:10.611 --> 10:12.544
Before you were stood up.

10:12.546 --> 10:15.413
Thank you for making me
take the reservation, max.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.414
I mean, otherwise,
I was just gonna

10:16.416 --> 10:17.649
Get in bed
and be depressed.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.619
You were in bed
and you were depressed.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.154
Don't rewrite history
just 'cause these folks have.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.823
I mean, we are
smack in the belly

10:24.825 --> 10:28.760
Of williamsburg ironic chic,
and I want to smack it.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.895
Look, they even have
a country clothesline

10:30.897 --> 10:32.631
Hung with baby clothes.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.433
We should get this for han.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.469
I mean, that is
the most pretentious thing

10:37.471 --> 10:38.637
I've ever seen.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.271
Hi, welcome
to harlow and daughters.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.974
I'm the host, brian-brian.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.577
No, that is.

10:45.579 --> 10:49.114
Yes, hi, um, brian-brian.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.416
We have a reservation.
Faison, party of two.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.851
Is your whole party here?

10:52.853 --> 10:54.753
Well, I don't know how whole
I could ever hope to be,

10:54.755 --> 10:56.688
As I'm illegitimate.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.523
Yes, we're both here.
Thank you.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.925
So both you and mr. Faison
are here?

11:00.927 --> 11:05.764
Yes, I'm transitioning.
Ask around.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.365
You can have a drink,
and I'll call you

11:07.367 --> 11:08.633
When your table is ready.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.302
Thank you, thank you,
brian-brian.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.604
I'll be right over.

11:12.606 --> 11:16.541
Go use your new boobs
to get us a seat at the bar.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.010
Hi, I know what
"wait by the bar" means.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.178
I've been working
in restaurants

11:20.180 --> 11:22.347
Since your clothes
were in style.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.715
It means I'll seat you
when your--

11:23.717 --> 11:26.718
Brian-brian, bri-bri,
b.B., come on.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.621
You and I both know
there's no guy coming.

11:29.623 --> 11:32.123
My friend got stood up, so
please don't make things worse.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.892
Just take out your cool,
little hunting knife

11:33.894 --> 11:36.227
And cut us some slack.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.530
This is where I'd tip you
with cash or offer you sex,

11:38.532 --> 11:40.165
But I'm kinda broke
and you're kinda gay,

11:40.167 --> 11:43.168
So just be nice.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.571
We don't really need to bring
my sexuality into it.

11:46.573 --> 11:50.241
I understand, it's hard
to be out 100 years ago.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.644
Oh, funny.

11:52.646 --> 11:55.013
Right this way,
mr. Faison.

11:55.015 --> 11:58.083
Wow, that was quick.
They're so nice here.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.051
Yep, just regular folks,

12:00.053 --> 12:02.554
Sitting around
designer pickle barrels.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.856
All right, here's your table.
Have a seat.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.025
Sure, where?
On these amish birthing stools

12:07.027 --> 12:09.561
We're all calling chairs?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.831
Stick to the gay jokes.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.867
Our wifi password
is on the ox hide.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.669
Your waitress will be
right over.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.771
Max, a waitress
will be right over,

12:19.773 --> 12:21.039
And it won't be us.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.708
Look,
dirty sawdust floors.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.843
If we got
a bag of wood chips,

12:24.845 --> 12:27.045
Our apartment could be
the new "it" place.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.181
Hello, my name is york.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.884
Hard to believe,
but a man named brian-brian

12:32.886 --> 12:34.953
Has been dethroned.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.922
York? That's fun.
"york" as in "new"?

12:37.924 --> 12:41.126
York as in york.
Just york.

12:41.128 --> 12:44.129
So what's this bit?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.131
Okay.
Well, um, york,

12:46.133 --> 12:47.565
We'd like to start
with some drinks.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.700
Having a girls' night out.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.002
All the single ladies
put ya hands up!

12:52.738 --> 12:55.607
Yeah, you can't force it.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.042
Our special libation
this evening

12:58.044 --> 12:59.811
Is "the small pox."

12:59.813 --> 13:02.647
It's absinthe, cloves,
orange bitters

13:02.649 --> 13:05.383
Hand-muddled
in a mason jar.

13:05.385 --> 13:09.587
Was that drink
directed by wes anderson?

13:09.589 --> 13:12.056
Can we just get two of your
"ye olde" cheapest beers

13:12.058 --> 13:13.725
As soon as possible?

13:13.727 --> 13:16.261
Because dr. Quinn,
I need some medicine, woman.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.897
York, does the special soup
have any garlic?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.665
Oh, my god, no way!

13:20.667 --> 13:22.801
What?
Is someone making soap?

13:22.803 --> 13:24.903
No.
No garlic?

13:24.905 --> 13:26.805
You still think
the surfer's coming.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.407
Well, he might.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.276
See, I was supposed to have
a date with this guy--

13:31.278 --> 13:34.312
You don't care.
So, the soup?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.515
Actually, I'm just
taking drink orders right now.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.618
Wow, who loved you?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.854
Eh, I'm guessing
she never went

13:42.856 --> 13:46.491
To a father/daughter dance
with her mom's weed dealer.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.994
You don't know, max.
Maybe he lost his phone

13:49.996 --> 13:52.864
And he didn't have my number,
so he's on his way running here.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.967
You think he's just
gonna rush in soaking wet

13:55.969 --> 13:58.636
And be like, "oh, I'm so sorry.
The traffic was terrible.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.806
The waves were
bumper-to-bumper."

14:01.808 --> 14:03.808
This is not
a katherine heigl movie.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.444
Sorry, "movie."

14:06.446 --> 14:07.879
Fine, he's not coming.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.781
And I'm not getting into
the katie heigl thing.

14:09.783 --> 14:13.017
Not here, not now.
Let's just enjoy our acorns.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.955
[phone ringing]

14:16.957 --> 14:18.189
Ooh, "blocked number."

14:18.191 --> 14:19.357
Maybe it's him.
Hello?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.026
Hang up.
He's not coming.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.839
Our drinks are right there.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.642
I can see them over yonder,
on ye olde bar.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.646
It's been an hour, where is
our waitress, lizzie borden?

14:42.882 --> 14:43.848
Probably in the back
deciding

14:43.850 --> 14:46.885
Which words
to pronounce weirdly.

14:46.887 --> 14:50.822
I'm starving.
Bust out those chicken cutlets.

14:50.824 --> 14:53.391
No wonder they don't have
any bad yelp reviews.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.860
No one's ever
tasted their food.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.896
Hi.
Um, our drinks?

14:57.898 --> 14:59.898
And did you ask the chef
about the soup?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.800
You know,
I haven't had a minute.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.572
She hasn't had a minute?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.008
What's she been doing,
dancing with wolves?

15:11.944 --> 15:14.779
I mean, have you ever?

15:14.781 --> 15:17.048
I know, can you even?
[scoffs]

15:17.050 --> 15:18.516
Byron and I have been here
forever,

15:18.518 --> 15:21.019
And have yet to see our
dandelion chickpea foie-gras.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.954
He's hypoglycemic
and I'm lila.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.923
And I'm pissed.
I'm getting our drinks.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.625
Would you get us some wine?
Oh, sure, what kind?

15:27.627 --> 15:29.928
A chardonnay for me, and byron
will have a sauvignon blanc.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.629
Max, no, they'll kick us out
and--

15:31.631 --> 15:33.564
And what?
What, caroline?

15:33.566 --> 15:35.400
You won't be here
when he arrives?

15:35.402 --> 15:37.802
Dear lord,
the man is not coming!

15:37.804 --> 15:42.373
I know that, max, and he's
not coming because he died.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.043
He died, that's the only reason
I can accept.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.881
What's up?
How we all doin' tonight?

15:49.883 --> 15:51.115
Not so good.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.550
My girlfriend
just broke up with me.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.918
Oh, yeah?
You like blondes?

15:53.920 --> 15:57.055
'cause I got one
who's ready to pop.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.223
No, man,
I'm into asian chicks.

15:59.225 --> 16:03.761
Yeah, who isn't?
Except for asian guys.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.563
Hey, do me a favor,
just wait a minute,

16:05.565 --> 16:08.066
And then come over to my table
and flirt with my friend.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.301
Why would I do that?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.970
On the house.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.740
Is that the "dandelion chickpea
and other things

16:15.742 --> 16:18.309
That don't belong
in a dish together" thing?

16:21.847 --> 16:24.983
All right,
your dandelion chickpea,

16:24.985 --> 16:29.587
A chardonnay,
and a sauvignon blanc. Enjoy.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.155
What do you think
you're doing?

16:31.157 --> 16:34.225
Waiting on tables.
Look into it.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.095
York, york, don't be mad.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.097
Byron was starving
and we're thirsty.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.866
Don't kick us out, we're
too weak to go anywhere else.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.868
The soup has garlic.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.703
Oh, then no.
The salmon, please.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.940
Bring her the damn soup, she
ain't kissing nobody tonight.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.808
And I'll have
the free-range chicken

16:50.810 --> 16:53.144
That thought
it had a chance.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.947
For your help.
Byron wants you to have it.

16:55.949 --> 16:59.984
Well, byron is the only real
old-fashioned thing in here.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.620
I hope you both
survive the winter.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.057
Hey, can I join you?

17:06.059 --> 17:08.826
Ooh, I think that
"can I join you?" was to you.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.496
Oh, sure, have a seat.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.565
You're pretty.
You have a good body.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.069
Wow, thank you.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.369
That's actually
kind of nice to hear,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.005
Because this
is hard to believe,

17:21.007 --> 17:21.973
But I got stood up tonight,

17:21.974 --> 17:23.674
And it kind of
makes me feel good

17:23.675 --> 17:25.175
When you say I'm pretty
and I have a good body.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.145
[phone chimes]
what are you doing?

17:27.146 --> 17:29.247
Oh, I'm on tinder.
It's the straight grindr.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.215
I just got a hit.
Well, I'm out.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.652
Thanks for the drink.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.525
You paid a guy
to say I'm pretty?

17:40.527 --> 17:44.028
And then he blew me off?

17:44.030 --> 17:46.431
Oh, my god. I just realized
something upsetting.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.732
What, that we could be
enjoying

17:47.734 --> 17:52.336
Delicious hot dogs on sticks
right now?

17:52.338 --> 17:55.006
No, I'm a "b."

17:55.008 --> 17:56.074
No, you're an "a."

17:56.076 --> 17:58.176
That bra just makes
you look like a "b."

17:58.178 --> 18:01.846
No, I mean me, as a woman.
I'm a "b."

18:01.848 --> 18:05.216
You know, all this time,
I kinda thought I was an "a,"

18:05.218 --> 18:07.785
But maybe I'm just a "b."

18:07.787 --> 18:10.388
That's why he walked away
and why the surfer stood me up.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.857
Caroline, I really want
to be here for you right now,

18:12.859 --> 18:16.727
But I gotta get a gin fizz
to the prospector in the corner.

18:16.729 --> 18:20.031
Max, am I a "b"?
Why didn't he come?

18:20.033 --> 18:22.200
All I know about that surfer
is that he is a "d"

18:22.202 --> 18:25.603
Followed by three
other letters.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.205
I'd spell it out for you,

18:27.207 --> 18:30.041
But I'm literally afraid
I'd get it wrong.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.743
Interesting that you
didn't say I wasn't a "b."

18:32.745 --> 18:35.079
Look, I don't give myself
letters in life.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.648
To me, it is clearly
a pass/fail situation.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.250
And you're sitting up,

18:39.252 --> 18:42.120
Not drooling on yourself,
so pass.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.962
Well, well, well,

18:50.964 --> 18:53.297
Where have you ladies
been all night?

18:53.299 --> 18:57.268
I don't know, I'd say somewhere
between 1846 and 1860.

18:57.270 --> 19:01.139
And it is so great
to be back in 1974.

19:01.141 --> 19:05.510
Well, han, you did a good job
of making this place exclusive.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.678
There is literally
nobody here.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.282
It wasn't my doing, there was
a possum in the men's room.

19:11.284 --> 19:14.285
Correction, there <i>is</i>
<i>a possum in the men's room.</i>

19:14.287 --> 19:17.588
Oh, the ingredients
are escaping the kitchen again?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.157
Well, I gotta
go to the men's room

19:19.159 --> 19:20.525
And pull out the possum.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.327
Oh, is that what you do
when we're not here?

19:23.329 --> 19:25.096
All right,
let's sit down

19:25.098 --> 19:27.932
In that authentically run-down
old booth and eat something.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.333
Yeah, see, those stains
aren't fake, that's real blood.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.936
I was right here
when that guy got stabbed.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.305
Like I said at the time,
"call me 'honey' one more time,

19:34.307 --> 19:36.274
And I will stab you."

19:36.276 --> 19:37.775
You know what I just
realized?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.478
Even if I am a "b,"
at least I'm an authentic "b."

19:40.480 --> 19:42.647
I don't pretend
to be something I'm not.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.882
You do kind of pretend
to be something you're not.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.051
A "b."

19:47.053 --> 19:49.287
Finally,
I have some customers.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.788
You know, I've been
sitting in the back

19:50.790 --> 19:53.691
Watching oleg
shuck his corn all night?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.726
Thank you.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.863
Now, luis knows
how to give service.

19:58.865 --> 20:03.201
Come on, chica, don't set me up
like that, it's too easy.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.870
Max, I think I'm gonna
let go of letter-grading myself

20:05.872 --> 20:07.572
And adopt
your pass/fail system.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.808
And sitting with you right here
is so not a fail.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.745
Oh, it's just
oleg and sophie.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.480
Oh, my god!
You looked 'cause you thought

20:16.482 --> 20:20.084
It was gonna be the surfer!
Epic fail!

20:20.086 --> 20:23.221
Hey, what are you two
doing together?

20:23.223 --> 20:26.390
Oh, sophie and I had
some business to take care of.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.892
Right, sophie?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.529
Oh, yeah.
Caroline, we got your back.

20:31.531 --> 20:35.566
That mike won't be out there
surfing again for quite a while.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.070
The surfer's name isn't mike.
It's marc.

20:40.038 --> 20:41.572
Oh...

20:41.574 --> 20:45.977
No wonder he kept screaming,
"my name is not marc!"

20:48.513 --> 20:50.381
Well, I'll tell you
one thing,

20:50.383 --> 20:52.583
We may have seen
a lot of fake things tonight,

20:52.585 --> 20:55.453
But that's
a for-real possum.

20:57.389 --> 21:02.126
Wow, han's possum is bigger
than I thought it would be.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.664
