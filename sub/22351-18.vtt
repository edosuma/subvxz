WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:04.950
>> Previously on "big
brother".

00:04.950 --> 00:08.990
After Austin revealed the
secret to Jason.

00:08.990 --> 00:12.990
>> You could take this me
and Julia.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.990
>> I would be fine with
that.

00:14.990 --> 00:18.700
>> His alliance members Clay,
Shelli and Vanessa decided

00:18.700 --> 00:19.990
to turn on him.

00:19.990 --> 00:22.410
>> Did if you lie to me an
get caught, it's over.

00:22.410 --> 00:23.990
I don't trust.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.290
He's not working with me,
that's it.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.990
>> And they even formed a
new alliance to get the job

00:27.990 --> 00:28.990
done.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.830
>> It would be best to have
Austin go home first and

00:31.830 --> 00:33.990
then the twins.

00:33.990 --> 00:33.990
Final eight.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.990
>> I will shake your hand,
you have my word, it is 100%

00:36.990 --> 00:37.990
the plan.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.990
>> Plus when Austin found
out he was in danger.

00:39.990 --> 00:41.990
>> Are you going to put me
up.

00:41.990 --> 00:43.990
>> Oh my God, Vanessa.

00:43.990 --> 00:44.700
>> Please.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.700
>> He begged his alliance
for a second chance.

00:46.700 --> 00:50.700
>> I will do anything,
anything, anything.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.990
I'm for you guy, I'm not
afraid to go against you, I

00:53.990 --> 00:54.990
am not going to.

00:54.990 --> 00:56.990
>> It is not in our best
interest for you to go home.

00:56.990 --> 01:00.990
>> So they opted to go for a
new target.

01:00.990 --> 01:01.990
>> Jace.

01:01.990 --> 01:07.990
>> Leaving-of the house
completely blindsided after

01:07.990 --> 01:10.990
Clay and Shelli lied about
their involvement in the

01:10.990 --> 01:12.990
plan,.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.990
>> I swear I did not know.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.990
>> Austin has the plan.

01:16.990 --> 01:18.410
>> No I don't want Jason to
go.

01:18.410 --> 01:21.990
>> I call Shelli out and
freaking out, I knew 100%

01:21.990 --> 01:27.990
she was on board and that is
shady as hell.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.990
>> James-- figured out they
have all been played.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.950
>> They are all working
together with Jace.

01:32.950 --> 01:34.990
>> At the live eviction.

01:34.990 --> 01:35.990
>> .

01:35.990 --> 01:40.290
>> Julie: By a vote of 7-2,
Jason, you are evicted from

01:40.290 --> 01:42.120
the "Big Brother" house.

01:42.120 --> 01:47.950
>> Jason said bye to the
house.

01:47.950 --> 01:48.990
>> Julie: Please fwaer in
the living room right now.

01:48.990 --> 01:52.990
>> After surviving five
evictions, the twin twist

01:52.990 --> 01:57.290
ended and Julia and Liz
earned the right to play as

01:57.290 --> 02:00.990
individuals.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.990
And Julie announced the end
of the battle of the block.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.990
>> Julie: From this moment
on there will be just one

02:06.990 --> 02:11.990
head of household and two
nominees.

02:11.990 --> 02:15.990
With the house divided, an
epic battle of endurance

02:15.990 --> 02:18.990
began.

02:18.990 --> 02:22.990
Tonight will the alliance
remain in power or will the

02:22.990 --> 02:25.990
other side of the house
finally claim victory?

02:25.990 --> 02:28.830
Plus which two house guests
will be nominated for

02:28.830 --> 02:28.990
eviction.

02:28.990 --> 02:33.990
Find out right now on "big
brother".

02:33.990 --> 02:36.990
>> One, two, three, four

03:15.990 --> 03:15.990
>> Julie: House guests.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.540
>> Hey, Julie.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.990
>> Julie: The power is back
up for grabs.

03:19.990 --> 03:22.990
The last house guest left on
the cliff's edge will be the

03:22.990 --> 03:27.990
new hoh.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.990
>> Oh, that's gold.

03:29.990 --> 03:30.990
>> Oh yeah, baby.

03:30.990 --> 03:33.410
>> My best friend just left.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.990
Twins have come into the
house.

03:34.990 --> 03:37.990
I know that people are
targetsing my other best

03:37.990 --> 03:38.990
friends in the house.

03:38.990 --> 03:41.990
We have to win.

03:41.990 --> 03:45.990
The stakes are the highest
they've ever been for this

03:45.990 --> 03:49.990
hoh competition.

03:49.990 --> 03:54.540
>> I don't think that water
was cold enough.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.950
>> My makeup is all over the
bald eagle.

03:56.950 --> 03:58.990
>> Oh, gosh, oh, wow.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.290
>> Get low.

04:00.290 --> 04:02.990
>> Oh man, okay, yeah.

04:02.990 --> 04:05.990
>> So Julia is finally able
to play in this game and

04:05.990 --> 04:08.990
"the sixth sense" is all
here but going into this hoh

04:08.990 --> 04:12.990
I'm very nervous, now we are
a huge target because we're

04:12.990 --> 04:14.410
like this.

04:14.410 --> 04:17.990
>> Oh my gosh.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.990
>> Choo whooo!

04:19.990 --> 04:25.410
>> During my reign as hoh
last week I blindsided Jason

04:25.410 --> 04:30.950
and his allies probably
blame me, so James, Meg and

04:30.950 --> 04:32.990
Jackie can't win because if
they do I'm almost sure I

04:32.990 --> 04:35.000
will end up on the block.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.990
>> It is not stressful
enough to try to win hoh

04:37.990 --> 04:40.990
already, Liz has promised me
a passionate kiss if I can

04:40.990 --> 04:42.290
pull off the victory.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.990
>> You want motivation, if
you win hoh tomorrow I will

04:44.990 --> 04:47.990
give you a kiss.

04:47.990 --> 04:48.990
>> I'm focused.

04:48.990 --> 04:49.990
I'm dialed in.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.950
No one is going to stop me.

04:51.950 --> 04:53.700
>> Now I really need to
focus.

04:53.700 --> 04:57.000
>> Oh my God this is
freezing.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.830
>> Wet t-shirt contest.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.990
>> I just got myself off the
block but it was far too

05:00.990 --> 05:01.990
close for my liking.

05:01.990 --> 05:04.990
There is only going to be
one hoh so this means for

05:04.990 --> 05:08.120
the first time that winning
guarantees my safety for the

05:08.120 --> 05:09.950
week.

05:09.950 --> 05:13.990
>> No pain no gain.

05:13.990 --> 05:15.410
>> Hold on no more water.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.990
>> No more water.

05:16.990 --> 05:20.990
>> Y'all want to start
making some deals?

05:20.990 --> 05:26.990
Okay, no deals, all right,
cool, cool.

05:26.990 --> 05:27.990
>> That's terrifying.

05:27.990 --> 05:32.990
>> Oh God.

05:32.990 --> 05:34.990
>> Oh.

05:34.990 --> 05:37.990
>> Right in the --
>> I need to one this hoh to

05:37.990 --> 05:40.540
change the pecking order.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.990
My back is up against the
wall, and they are

05:43.990 --> 05:46.990
assassinating all my troups.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.410
I'm tired of getting pecked
at.

05:48.410 --> 05:52.830
It's time to peck back on
them.

05:52.830 --> 05:56.990
>> I have never seen a bald
agency Nell my life then 11

05:56.990 --> 05:59.990
of them with a synchronized
attack to take out people

05:59.990 --> 06:00.990
hanging from a cliff.

06:00.990 --> 06:03.990
This is very professional of
them.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.830
>> If they went a little
lower we'd be screwed.

06:06.830 --> 06:10.990
>> Oh, come on.

06:10.990 --> 06:14.950
My arms are killing me, my
legs are killing me.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.120
Already getting really
tough.

06:16.120 --> 06:21.410
I'm in trouble.

06:21.410 --> 06:21.990
>> Oh.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.990
>> Oh pie goodness.

06:23.990 --> 06:28.540
>> Oh, look at that incline.

06:28.540 --> 06:31.830
It's brought ago to not be
able to play in the hoh

06:31.830 --> 06:31.990
competition.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.990
I really need my alliance to
pull through this week and

06:34.990 --> 06:37.990
be able to protect me given
that I had to get so much

06:37.990 --> 06:38.990
blood on my hands this week.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.990
>> Anybody want to cut any
deals?

06:40.990 --> 06:41.990
No?

06:41.990 --> 06:42.990
Okay.

06:42.990 --> 06:45.830
Back on my wall then.

06:45.830 --> 06:45.990
>> Oh.

06:45.990 --> 06:50.990
>> Oh my God.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.990
>> Oh what is that?

06:52.990 --> 06:55.700
>> This totally sucks.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.410
I thought like last week I
totally got crapped on.

06:58.410 --> 07:01.990
And now I feel like I'm
literally being crapped on.

07:01.990 --> 07:02.990
>> Bring it on.

07:02.990 --> 07:08.990
Eat it for breakfast.

07:08.990 --> 07:09.410
>> Not good.

07:09.410 --> 07:23.950
>> Hang in there, Meg.

07:23.950 --> 07:26.990
>> My body is trembling am
but all I'm visualizing is

07:26.990 --> 07:30.540
that kiss from Liz and I'm
trying as hard as I can to

07:30.540 --> 07:37.830
shut out the pain.

07:37.830 --> 07:47.990
>> Dammit.

07:47.990 --> 07:48.990
>> Austin is the first to
call.

07:48.990 --> 07:58.990
>> I guess I can kiss that
kiss good-bye.

07:58.990 --> 08:04.990
>> Oh my God, oh my God.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.990
>> Julia's down.

08:06.990 --> 08:08.990
Meg takes a spill.

08:08.990 --> 08:12.990
>> Wow that was hard really
hard.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.990
>> I see Liz fall and my
heart sinks.

08:14.990 --> 08:17.990
And I go wait a minute, that
was Julia, this is going to

08:17.990 --> 08:19.950
take some getting used to.

08:19.950 --> 08:20.990
>> Good job, Julia.

08:20.990 --> 08:23.990
Good job, Meg.

08:23.990 --> 08:26.120
>> Hang on tight you guys,
you got this.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.990
Hang on tight.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.990
>> It's extremely stressful
to watch your alliance

08:29.990 --> 08:33.990
members fall off the wall
one by one and know there is

08:33.990 --> 08:33.990
nothing you can do.

08:33.990 --> 08:36.990
You are forced to sit on the
sidelines and watch.

08:36.990 --> 08:38.990
>> You guises are all
killing it.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.990
>> I see you.

08:46.990 --> 08:52.830
>>> Hang in there.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.000
Come on.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.990
This is really, really cold.

08:56.990 --> 08:58.990
>> My body is shaking.

08:58.990 --> 09:01.540
My muscles are tightening
up.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.990
I'm fighting through it for
Jason.

09:02.990 --> 09:19.540
I want to get a
little redemption for him.

09:19.540 --> 09:22.540
>> Don't give up.

09:22.540 --> 09:26.990
All right, all right.

09:26.990 --> 09:27.990
>> Hang in there.

09:27.990 --> 09:33.290
>> Oh my gosh.

09:33.290 --> 09:33.990
>> This is epic.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.990
There is rain coming down
there is thunder and

09:36.990 --> 09:36.990
lightning.

09:36.990 --> 09:40.540
There are birds coming in,
swoop dive attacking us.

09:40.540 --> 09:51.990
This is just awesome.

09:51.990 --> 09:58.290
>> Come on guys.

09:58.290 --> 09:59.990
>> Hold on.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.990
>> I cannot fall off because
I know there is like seven

10:02.990 --> 10:05.990
other people that are
thinking that we're going to

10:05.990 --> 10:07.990
get James out this week if
he falls off.

10:07.990 --> 10:15.990
And I'm not going to give
them that satz fraction.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.990
>> I just start feeling my
arms giving out.

10:17.990 --> 10:21.990
My legs are trembling but
now that Julia and Austin

10:21.990 --> 10:25.000
are gone it's up to me, Clay
and Shelli to insurance our

10:25.000 --> 10:26.410
safety this week.

10:26.410 --> 10:30.990
As much as I feel like I'm
slipping, I cannot give up

10:30.990 --> 10:31.990
yet.

10:31.990 --> 10:38.990
>> Good job, lids.

10:38.990 --> 10:39.830
>> Hold on.

10:39.830 --> 10:40.990
You got this guys.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.990
>> Keep holding on.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.990
>> The struggle is really
going down right now.

10:44.990 --> 10:47.990
These arms are about to
break off and I am trying to

10:47.990 --> 10:55.290
hold on for dear life.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.990
>> Hold on.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.990
>> And Jackie is down within
it's all right, Jackie.

11:00.990 --> 11:01.990
Good work, good work.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.290
>> Good job, girl.

11:03.290 --> 11:07.990
>> Good work, Jackie.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.990
>> Jackie falls which means
I feel like all the weight

11:09.990 --> 11:12.990
is on my shoulders and they
are all looking at me.

11:12.990 --> 11:20.410
So I definitely have to pull
this one out now.

11:20.410 --> 11:20.990
>> Come on.

11:20.990 --> 11:22.990
>> This incline is getting
worse and worse.

11:22.990 --> 11:26.700
My body is just telling me
Liz, sorry girl, it's your

11:26.700 --> 11:29.990
time to go.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.990
>> Good work, Liz, good
work.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.990
>> Liz takes a fall.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.990
>> Liz goes down and I want
to scream out, ah!

11:37.990 --> 11:40.830
I feel like my alliance
members are dropping off the

11:40.830 --> 11:41.990
wall like flies.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.990
All I have left to root for
are Shelli and Clay.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.990
However, anyone but James
looks like a goods

11:46.990 --> 11:47.990
situation.

11:47.990 --> 12:09.990
>> Good job, Liz
.

12:09.990 --> 12:10.990
>> You guys got this.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.120
>> Careful, guys.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.990
>> Come on, James.

12:13.990 --> 12:14.540
>> Hold on.

12:14.540 --> 12:17.700
>> Anyone want to make a
deal?

12:17.700 --> 12:26.950
>> My lower lumbar the burn.

12:26.950 --> 12:27.410
It's intense.

12:27.410 --> 12:29.990
I don't know if I.

12:29.990 --> 12:33.290
>> Right now I'm trying to
play my game with Clay, I

12:33.290 --> 12:35.990
definitely know from being
in the military, once you

12:35.990 --> 12:38.990
see fat agency and you see
your brothers kind of falter,

12:38.990 --> 12:42.990
that creates a big paranoia
in his mind where he is like

12:42.990 --> 12:43.990
can I even do this.

12:43.990 --> 12:50.990
>> Hang in there, Clay, hold
on.

12:50.990 --> 12:56.990
>>> My arms are really
giving out, I am just

12:56.990 --> 12:57.990
dangling and dying.

12:57.990 --> 13:00.990
>> Come on, hold on, Becky.

13:00.990 --> 13:01.990
>> Come on.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.990
>> If are you going to fall,
slide because it seems to be

13:04.990 --> 13:05.990
working for James.

13:05.990 --> 13:09.120
>> Come on.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.990
>> Becky takes a spill.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.830
>> Good job, Becky.

13:13.830 --> 13:14.990
>> Think about that letter
from the family.

13:14.990 --> 13:15.990
>> I want to get that
letter.

13:15.990 --> 13:17.990
>> Think about those
pictures.

13:17.990 --> 13:18.990
Come on.

13:18.990 --> 13:23.830
Oh, come on.

13:23.830 --> 13:26.700
>> Oh my God, Clay, please
hang on.

13:26.700 --> 13:31.990
Just hang on.

13:31.990 --> 13:33.700
>> Clay no, Clay, no.

13:33.700 --> 13:34.990
>> Hang in there, buddy.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.990
>> Good job, you guys.

13:37.990 --> 13:40.990
>> Come on, Clay.

13:40.990 --> 13:42.990
>> Thank you.

13:42.990 --> 13:43.990
>> Good job, Clay.

13:43.990 --> 13:44.990
>> It's okay.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.990
>> So Clay drops and I'm
worried my alliance might

13:47.990 --> 13:48.990
not be able to win this
thing.

13:48.990 --> 13:57.990
All I have left to root for
are Shelli and Johnny mack.

13:57.990 --> 13:59.120
>> Shelli, are you looking
good.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.990
>> Now that Clay is down I'm
the only one of the sixth

14:02.990 --> 14:05.990
sense still up on the wall,
hanging on for dear life,

14:05.990 --> 14:09.410
trying to figure out what is
best for my game and our

14:09.410 --> 14:09.990
alliance.

14:09.990 --> 14:13.830
Every bit of this weight is
on my shoulders now.

14:13.830 --> 14:15.410
>> Hold on.

14:15.410 --> 14:17.990
>> We're down to the wire,
me, Shelli and John left.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.990
I done know if I can trust
John or not because he's a

14:20.990 --> 14:20.990
wild car.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.990
And I don't trust Shelli
right now.

14:22.990 --> 14:26.990
I don't care how much pain
or coldness hits this body,

14:26.990 --> 14:29.990
all I know is they are going
to have to peel me off that

14:29.990 --> 14:31.990
wall because I ain't letting
go.

14:44.990 --> 14:47.990
>> Right now I feel like I'm
in the middle of hell, there

14:47.990 --> 14:50.990
are definitely lines drawn
in the sand and I'm seeking

14:50.990 --> 14:51.120
revenge.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.990
>> Hold on guys.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.410
Good job, you guys.

14:56.410 --> 14:57.990
Hang in there.

14:57.990 --> 15:00.990
Stretch stretch it out.

15:00.990 --> 15:09.990
Stretch it out, stretch it
out.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.990
>> It's do or die, we'll do
this one for us.

15:12.990 --> 15:25.990
I'm not seeing any of my
petes go home this week.

15:25.990 --> 15:28.540
>> So Shelli ends up being
one of the last few remains

15:28.540 --> 15:28.990
on the wall.

15:28.990 --> 15:34.990
She desperately needs to win
it.

15:34.990 --> 15:37.990
So we have power this week.

15:37.990 --> 15:39.990
>> Good job, you guys.

15:39.990 --> 15:42.990
>> Great jobs.

15:42.990 --> 15:47.990
>> You got it, Johnnie, you
got it Johnnie, you got it.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.120
>> I'm really getting tired.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.990
I have been hanging on to
this thing for who knows how

15:53.990 --> 15:57.290
long, and I don't know if
winning hoh for the third

15:57.290 --> 16:01.990
time is really in my best
interest.

16:01.990 --> 16:10.990
>> Hang on, Shelli.

16:10.990 --> 16:16.700
>> I've done this twice, I
want to see gizmo, camie, I

16:16.700 --> 16:18.990
need your word, no
nominations, no back door

16:18.990 --> 16:21.000
for me or Clay.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.990
>> When Shelli makes a deal
for her safety and Clay's

16:23.990 --> 16:27.290
safety but totally neglects
to include me, it shows me

16:27.290 --> 16:29.990
that I was really down on
their totem pole of

16:29.990 --> 16:30.990
importance.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.120
>> Got it, James.

16:31.120 --> 16:31.990
>> I promise.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.120
>> No back door, no
nomination for me or Clay.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.990
>> You or Clay.

16:35.990 --> 16:37.990
>> Right now I'm telling
them what they want to hear

16:37.990 --> 16:41.950
because if this is big
brother, and the words are

16:41.950 --> 16:44.990
the boogie, you can bounce
checks up in this house.

16:44.990 --> 16:45.990
>> For me or Clay.

16:45.990 --> 16:46.990
>> I promise.

16:46.990 --> 16:47.990
>> Or Johnnie mack.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.990
>> Or Johnnie mack.

16:49.990 --> 16:52.700
>> Johnnie mack, you ain't
got no worries buddy.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.990
>> I don't offer James any
deals because I don't want

16:54.990 --> 16:58.990
to tick anyone off.

16:58.990 --> 17:03.000
>> But j-mack you're good
anyway, I'm like, thanks.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.990
>> Okay.

17:04.990 --> 17:05.830
>> I promise.

17:05.830 --> 17:10.540
>> Well done.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.990
>> Congratulations James,
you are the new head of

17:12.990 --> 17:14.990
household.

17:14.990 --> 17:18.540
>> James, we won!

17:18.540 --> 17:19.990
>> Yeah, jamesie.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.990
>> I just won hoh.

17:21.990 --> 17:23.000
It's an awesome feeling.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.540
I'm the sole hoh.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.990
I have all the power in the
house and I'm seeking

17:26.990 --> 17:30.990
revenge for all my fallen
comrades.

17:30.990 --> 17:31.990
>> Good job.

17:31.990 --> 17:33.990
>> Definitely not afraid to
get any blood on my hands

17:33.990 --> 17:37.990
and every time I hit hoh I
will let these people know

17:37.990 --> 17:39.540
that I'm going for big
targets.

17:39.540 --> 17:41.990
>> You guys killed it.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.990
>> James winning hoh is
scary.

17:43.990 --> 17:45.830
I don't know where his head
is at.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.990
All I know is thatas week I
was supposed to be back

17:48.990 --> 17:50.000
doored and he was agreeing
to it.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.990
Right now it's all up in the
air.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.990
>> Right now I feel all
right with my deal with

17:56.990 --> 17:56.990
James.

17:56.990 --> 17:59.990
I do think that he is the
type of person that will

17:59.990 --> 18:00.990
keep his word.

18:00.990 --> 18:04.990
This is a deal that was made
in front of the entire house,

18:04.990 --> 18:07.990
so if he doesn't stay true
to his word that is saying a

18:07.990 --> 18:10.990
lot about James as a game
player and I think he's

18:10.990 --> 18:15.950
smarter than that.

18:15.950 --> 18:19.990
>> Good job, man.

18:19.990 --> 18:21.990
>> Oh my God!

18:21.990 --> 18:23.990
You look so pretty, I hate
you.

18:23.990 --> 18:29.990
>> Oh my God, amen, praise
Jesus, definitely feels good

18:29.990 --> 18:31.990
to have the tires changed.

18:31.990 --> 18:35.000
We have been beaten up all
the weeks with Shelli and

18:35.000 --> 18:35.990
Vanessa.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.990
No more, I control this
game.

18:37.990 --> 18:40.990
>> Wow, Julia, it's
beautiful.

18:40.990 --> 18:41.830
>> Look gorgeous.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.000
>> Oh my God, I have a
keynes.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.990
>> Now that James is hoh I'm
so freaked out about our

18:47.990 --> 18:48.990
safety in this game.

18:48.990 --> 18:52.990
We've never aligned ourselve
with James and I've kind of

18:52.990 --> 19:07.990
been gunning for him in
previous weeks.

19:07.990 --> 19:08.700
>> .

19:08.700 --> 19:16.990
That's for all the marbles.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.990
>> I was afraid for not
cheering for you the whole

19:18.990 --> 19:19.990
time.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.000
>> When James wins it's like
a win for me.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.990
There couldn't be anyone
else in this house that I

19:24.990 --> 19:25.990
would rather be hoh this
week.

19:25.990 --> 19:29.000
We have been the underdogs
this whole time.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.540
Every week I'm voting
between sending my best

19:32.540 --> 19:35.990
friend home or my other best
friend home.

19:35.990 --> 19:42.290
We needed this so badly.

19:42.290 --> 19:50.120
>> That's my boy.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.950
>> Me winning this hoh is
definitely a good thing.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.990
They threw a shot at us and
this time it fired back.

19:54.990 --> 20:09.990
>> Time to rattle the cage.

20:09.990 --> 20:11.540
>> She knew she was going to
fall.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.990
She had to.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.990
Because he wasn't budging.

20:15.990 --> 20:19.000
>> I couldn't let them take
us out like that.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.990
It's all good.

20:20.990 --> 20:33.990
I'm going to fight back.

20:33.990 --> 20:44.290
>> Oh God.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.990
>> Worst-case scenario, I'll
go home.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.990
>> James winning hoh is
internal for me.

20:48.990 --> 20:51.990
I put him on the block
before and sent home two of

20:51.990 --> 20:53.990
his closest allies in Jeff
and Jason.

20:53.990 --> 20:56.990
Makes me nervous about who
his nominations are going to

20:56.990 --> 20:57.990
be.

20:57.990 --> 21:13.990
>> Only worried about what
you can control.

21:13.990 --> 21:15.990
>>> I want to talk about a
lot of stuff.

21:15.990 --> 21:18.990
>> The last time I was here
Austin told the enemy what

21:18.990 --> 21:20.830
my real name was.

21:20.830 --> 21:23.990
And I completely felt
betrayed by him.

21:23.990 --> 21:30.990
So I have to talk to Liz and
get to the bottom of this.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.990
>> Why would he --
>> why would he say-- it is

21:35.990 --> 21:38.990
not true.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.990
He would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

21:40.990 --> 21:44.990
He completely twisted the
entire thing.

21:44.990 --> 21:46.990
Which I don't believe it I
can't.

21:46.990 --> 21:49.990
>> Why would he tell them
the truth.

21:49.990 --> 21:51.990
>> You need to whisper,
whisper.

21:51.990 --> 21:58.990
>> Second of all, because
James just won,-- we're

21:58.990 --> 22:01.830
going to go home or Austin,
or me or you.

22:01.830 --> 22:03.990
Like we're in a really bad
point right now.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.990
>> We have to make a deal.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.990
>> Hello girls.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.990
The one disaster for me.

22:12.990 --> 22:14.120
>> So Jason left.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.990
>> Yeah, Jason got what he
deserved.

22:16.990 --> 22:17.540
>> Really?

22:17.540 --> 22:20.990
So you didn't tell him that
my name was Julia?

22:20.990 --> 22:22.990
>> We talked about it.

22:22.990 --> 22:23.990
>> Yeah, de.

22:23.990 --> 22:24.990
>> We didn't talk about
that.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.990
>> I talked about it with
him.

22:26.990 --> 22:28.990
>> Why didn't you talk about
it with me?

22:28.990 --> 22:34.990
>> It wasn't shady.

22:34.990 --> 22:37.700
>> Austin had a strong
connection with Liz, Julia

22:37.700 --> 22:38.990
is her twin sister.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.990
That means I have to have
respect for her as well.

22:41.990 --> 22:43.990
I'm trying to explain myself
with Julia and do some

22:43.990 --> 22:45.990
damage control.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.410
>> Yeah, I said too much.

22:47.410 --> 22:50.990
>> Right, right, so that is
what I believe, that you

22:50.990 --> 22:52.990
just be want to get me out.

22:52.990 --> 22:53.990
>> No.

22:53.990 --> 22:54.700
>> Let me ask you this.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.540
How did people know that my
name was Julia?

22:58.540 --> 22:59.990
>> You volunteered that
information.

22:59.990 --> 23:01.990
I don't think anyone knew
that.

23:01.990 --> 23:04.990
>> He was literally just
trying to open up to Jason

23:04.990 --> 23:07.990
to save us if Jason would
have won hoh.

23:07.990 --> 23:08.990
>> I thought oh this is
good.

23:08.990 --> 23:12.700
So then I said it,
afterwards I regret it and

23:12.700 --> 23:15.000
was embarrassed I said it
and didn't tell Vanessa or

23:15.000 --> 23:18.990
you, what happened he tried
to manipulate that with me

23:18.990 --> 23:20.410
tries to get you guys out or
something.

23:20.410 --> 23:24.990
>> Well, obviously I kind of
have a little ill-will

23:24.990 --> 23:26.410
towards you, you know.

23:26.410 --> 23:28.990
>> I don't trust one word he
is saying.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.990
It goes through one ear and
out the other.

23:30.990 --> 23:33.990
Liz as a close relationship
with Austin and she really

23:33.990 --> 23:35.990
feels like she can trust
him.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.990
But I wouldn't trust him
with a ten foot pole.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.830
I'm going to forgive but I
will never forget.

23:41.830 --> 23:44.540
>> You know, like we were
working together, I thought

23:44.540 --> 23:45.540
we were friends.

23:45.990 --> 23:46.990
>> We're beyond friends.

23:56.990 --> 24:01.990
>> I need to talk to
somebody.

24:01.990 --> 24:01.990
>> Okay.

24:01.990 --> 24:03.990
I'm really up set.

24:03.990 --> 24:09.990
I need to talk it out.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.990
I went into this hoh
competition thinking someone

24:11.990 --> 24:15.950
from our team has to win and
it can't be me because I

24:15.950 --> 24:17.540
have already won two hohs.

24:17.540 --> 24:21.000
I can't win a third and have
a huge target.

24:21.000 --> 24:21.990
>> Yeah.

24:21.990 --> 24:22.990
It's supertough.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.990
>> In your shoes, you did
the right thing.

24:24.990 --> 24:27.990
Quite frackly, for your own
game, I would love to say

24:27.990 --> 24:29.990
that you have pushed through
because it would have made

24:29.990 --> 24:33.290
me feel better.

24:33.290 --> 24:35.990
>> Should I say Vanessa too?

24:35.990 --> 24:37.990
I could have never done
that.

24:37.990 --> 24:40.990
>> I always knew Shelli and
Clay would have primary

24:40.990 --> 24:41.990
allegiances to each other.

24:41.990 --> 24:44.830
But I was hoping my safety
was also really important to

24:44.830 --> 24:44.990
them.

24:44.990 --> 24:47.990
When she doesn't include me
in a deal it solidifies my

24:47.990 --> 24:50.990
worst fear that I'm just not
that important to Shelli in

24:50.990 --> 24:51.830
this game.

24:51.830 --> 24:52.990
>> It's for the best.

24:52.990 --> 24:53.700
You've made a deal.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.990
And you can't do it three
times in a row.

24:55.990 --> 25:01.120
Everybody understands that.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.540
>> I didn't want-- the twins
right now.

25:04.540 --> 25:05.990
>> It's either me or them.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.990
>> The game we are playing,
the game we signed up for is,

25:08.990 --> 25:10.990
so you he know.

25:10.990 --> 25:14.990
>> The last person we wanted
to win was James.

25:14.990 --> 25:17.990
I hope they don't target
Vanessa.

25:17.990 --> 25:23.990
Everybody is mad at her.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.950
>> So frustrating.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.990
Julia is still pad at me.

25:28.990 --> 25:34.120
I tried to talk to her but
she seemed pretty angry.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.990
Maybe you guys could talk to
her too a little bit, let

25:36.990 --> 25:38.990
her understand it was
like --

25:38.990 --> 25:40.990
>> yeah, I definitely want
to talk to her.

25:40.990 --> 25:56.990
>> Okay, all right.

25:56.990 --> 26:06.990
Just want to make sure we
look out for Vanessa too.

26:06.990 --> 26:09.990
One if it is one of them,
it's my fault.

26:09.990 --> 26:19.990
>> You can't say it like
that.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.990
>> -- You are playing the
game for yourself, that's

26:21.990 --> 26:22.990
it.

26:22.990 --> 26:37.410
Your fault, no.

26:37.410 --> 26:41.990
It seems thanks for making
me feel better.

26:41.990 --> 26:43.990
>> Be careful.

26:55.990 --> 27:01.990
>> Just right dr -- because
I came out of the bathroom

27:01.990 --> 27:04.990
and came out here and it was
like where did he go.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.990
>> Oh, yeah, I told you I
was going --

27:06.990 --> 27:08.990
>> I didn't know.

27:08.990 --> 27:09.990
I didn't hear you say it.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.990
Because you mumble a lot,
you know.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.290
>> Oh, do I?

27:15.290 --> 27:17.990
No, the information she
acquired from us, that is

27:17.990 --> 27:20.830
the most-- part,.

27:20.830 --> 27:21.830
>> Say that again?

27:21.830 --> 27:24.990
>> Yeah.

27:24.990 --> 27:25.990
>> Shower.

27:25.990 --> 27:28.990
>> You're going to take a
shower did he say?

27:28.990 --> 27:33.990
>>-- My bag.

27:33.990 --> 27:37.950
>> Jason didn't know that
she said the same about you.

27:37.950 --> 27:41.990
>> I'm more involved with
the-- but in my professional

27:41.990 --> 27:44.990
opinion-- Clay may have
gotten hit one too pain

27:44.990 --> 27:47.000
times on that football
field.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.990
>> Jason, uh-huh.

27:48.990 --> 27:57.990
>> Wow-- what I'm talking
about.

27:57.990 --> 28:04.120
>> -- Some of that-- serious.

28:04.120 --> 28:06.990
>> It's like I'm following
every single word and then

28:06.990 --> 28:08.990
to the next sentence and
then --

28:08.990 --> 28:13.990
>> you get the picture.

28:13.990 --> 28:17.990
I don't --
>> you realize how much

28:17.990 --> 28:23.990
twisted words are going on
in this house.

28:23.990 --> 28:36.290
>> --
>> what are you doing?

28:36.290 --> 28:45.990
(Laughter)
>> Whooo!

28:45.990 --> 28:47.990
Yeah!

28:47.990 --> 28:50.540
That's the kind of reaction
I wanted.

28:50.540 --> 28:51.990
>> Well done, well done,
well done.

28:51.990 --> 28:52.990
>> Thank you.

28:52.990 --> 29:02.990
>> Well done.

29:02.990 --> 29:04.990
You knows what's funny is
when we were up on the

29:04.990 --> 29:07.830
boards, on the cliff,
whatever, I felt it very

29:07.830 --> 29:09.990
funny that Shelli was so
worried that she was wanting

29:09.990 --> 29:10.990
to cut deals with me.

29:10.990 --> 29:12.990
>> I know.

29:12.990 --> 29:14.990
>> Cuz if we were supposed
to be friends, working

29:14.990 --> 29:15.990
together.

29:15.990 --> 29:17.000
>> Should have been so
excited.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.950
>> I know I'm safe, I am
going to drop off if I can't

29:20.950 --> 29:20.990
win.

29:20.990 --> 29:23.410
>> Good lord, she did not
want to drop.

29:23.410 --> 29:24.000
>> That is guilt.

29:24.000 --> 29:24.990
They know.

29:24.990 --> 29:26.990
>> They know we're on to
them.

29:26.990 --> 29:27.990
>> They know what they did.

29:27.990 --> 29:29.990
>> I swear to you that they
are like the ones that are

29:29.990 --> 29:31.990
running this.

29:31.990 --> 29:33.990
>> They're coming after us
for sure and we need to

29:33.990 --> 29:33.990
throw down.

29:33.990 --> 29:34.990
>> Oh yeah.

29:34.990 --> 29:39.410
>> Because they blooep
wlooep-- up last week,

29:39.410 --> 29:40.540
they-- up so bad.

29:40.540 --> 29:41.990
>> They are obviously a
power couple in the house.

29:41.990 --> 29:46.990
>> They are, they are going
to run out out too,.

29:46.990 --> 29:50.990
>> She has to go, let's do
this they did it to us last

29:50.990 --> 29:50.990
weekness.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.990
>> You don't do that to us
and then walk around like

29:52.990 --> 29:53.830
whatever.

29:53.830 --> 29:56.830
>> One thing that I have to
bring up especially for

29:56.830 --> 29:57.990
James, he can't play next
week.

29:57.990 --> 30:00.410
>> The only people that will
come after him are Clay and

30:00.410 --> 30:04.990
maybe van easea.

30:04.990 --> 30:06.990
>> Basically what they did
to us.

30:06.990 --> 30:07.950
>> We're doing to them.

30:07.950 --> 30:09.000
>> We're going to do to
them.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.990
>> I love it.

30:10.990 --> 30:12.540
>> Shell sydefinitely my
target.

30:12.540 --> 30:13.990
She's the queen of the
house.

30:13.990 --> 30:15.990
She's doing all the footwork
for Clay.

30:15.990 --> 30:18.540
I take the queen out, the
king can only move one

30:18.540 --> 30:18.990
space.

30:18.990 --> 30:21.990
>> But do you throw her
straight up or back door her

30:21.990 --> 30:24.950
and who do you put her up
against to insurance that

30:24.950 --> 30:28.700
she goes home?

30:28.700 --> 30:32.990
>> Maybe Vanessa.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.990
Her sister absolutely.

30:34.990 --> 30:36.990
>> Austin is absolutely
going to put her up.

30:36.990 --> 30:39.990
>> Put me up on the board.

30:39.990 --> 30:41.990
>> No one could know about
this.

30:41.990 --> 30:43.950
>> Oh, no.

30:43.950 --> 30:45.990
>> No-- no one, not even the
people involved.

30:45.990 --> 30:51.540
You have to come with
another plan.

30:51.540 --> 30:51.990
>> Steve.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.990
>> Yeah, Steve's mar target.

30:54.990 --> 30:56.990
>> Easy way, done

31:08.990 --> 31:12.990
>> hey, can we totally --
>> sorry, can't --

31:12.990 --> 31:15.990
>> Clay and Shelli had a lot
to do with why I didn't go

31:15.990 --> 31:18.410
home the week before am so I
feel it is my duty to see

31:18.410 --> 31:20.990
what I can do to help.

31:20.990 --> 31:23.990
>> I think it is more on you
guys than Vanessa.

31:23.990 --> 31:27.700
You guys get paranoid, you
look sad, will you put both

31:27.700 --> 31:29.410
up at the same time.

31:29.410 --> 31:32.990
But if you guys act happy
they might put Vanessa and

31:32.990 --> 31:34.990
Austin up on the block.

31:34.990 --> 31:37.410
>> But they will try to back
door one of us.

31:37.410 --> 31:41.990
>> You have if you look
happy, cheery, feeling

31:41.990 --> 31:45.990
safe --
>> they're going to put her-- be

31:45.990 --> 31:48.990
smart with information
because she gets cornered,

31:48.990 --> 31:50.990
just act happy.

31:50.990 --> 31:53.540
>> Who brought up the first
thing about putting us up.

31:53.540 --> 31:59.410
>> All three of them.

31:59.410 --> 32:05.990
Try-- you have to ago happy
or they will be more direct.

32:05.990 --> 32:10.830
>> Why the hell did that
have to come down to me?

32:10.830 --> 32:13.990
>> I need to walk around.

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
>> Shelli.

32:14.990 --> 32:17.990
>> What, why can't I cool
off a little bit.

32:17.990 --> 32:19.990
>> But I mean walking around,
we need to figure this out.

32:19.990 --> 32:22.990
>> Why can't I get up an
just go eat cookies and

32:22.990 --> 32:24.990
pretend like nothing's going
on?

32:24.990 --> 32:27.990
>> She just told us to do
that.

32:27.990 --> 32:31.990
Clay this is when you get
me-- you don't let me walk.

32:31.990 --> 32:33.990
>> Because we have to figure
this out.

32:33.990 --> 32:36.990
>> What do we have to figure
this out.

32:36.990 --> 32:36.990
>> Okay.

32:36.990 --> 32:38.990
>> Why can't I get up and
walk around.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.990
Why do I have to sit here
and be up set.

32:41.990 --> 32:45.540
>> What is there to be up
set.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.990
We're going to go over and
talk to James, we need to

32:47.990 --> 32:48.990
have a game plan.

32:48.990 --> 32:52.700
Believe me, as pissed off as
you are, I am ten times as

32:52.700 --> 32:54.950
pissed off.

32:54.950 --> 32:55.990
>> I want to get Vanessa,
tell her what is going on

32:55.990 --> 33:00.290
and tell her that I'm
perfectly fine --

33:00.290 --> 33:08.990
>> Vanessa doesn't know this,
we have to talk to James.

33:08.990 --> 33:10.990
>> I knew this was going to
happen.

33:10.990 --> 33:14.830
I'm pissed off.

33:14.830 --> 33:17.990
Because I was under the
impression that winning hoh

33:17.990 --> 33:19.990
would not have been good for
me and it obviously would

33:19.990 --> 33:21.830
have been.

33:21.830 --> 33:34.990
>> We both had no idea that
they would do this.

33:34.990 --> 33:37.000
>> James won the hoh and I'm
terrified because someone

33:37.000 --> 33:39.990
has to pay for what happened
last week am now that Shelli

33:39.990 --> 33:43.000
and Clay are safe because
Shelli made a deal for them.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.990
I'm the only candidate to
take the blame.

33:46.990 --> 33:48.990
I'm going to have to pull a
rabbit out of a hat to stay

33:48.990 --> 33:49.990
off the block this week.

33:49.990 --> 33:51.990
>> So I dropped the bomb
last week.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.990
I know that I did it but it
was the house wanting it.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.990
And everyone knew it was
going to be a reorganization

33:56.990 --> 33:57.540
after that.

33:57.540 --> 33:59.990
It was more of a house
sdismtion I actually had

33:59.990 --> 34:02.410
nothing personal against him
it was everyone else did

34:02.410 --> 34:03.990
have personal things.

34:03.990 --> 34:06.830
In your shoes, I would think
about this.

34:06.830 --> 34:07.990
Probably considering what
happened last week, it would

34:07.990 --> 34:11.990
be smarter for you to make a
big pov which is going to

34:11.990 --> 34:13.990
reshape the way things are
in the house.

34:13.990 --> 34:15.990
Everyone knows that I trust
Shelli and Clay.

34:15.990 --> 34:18.990
Shelli is up there for you,
and who does she make a deal

34:18.990 --> 34:21.700
for Clay, so what does that
indicate to you.

34:21.700 --> 34:22.990
I'm a third wheel.

34:22.990 --> 34:27.410
>> If I wanted one of them
to go home, would you be

34:27.410 --> 34:30.990
against it.

34:30.990 --> 34:33.990
>> If you have to go after
someone and it's my friend

34:33.990 --> 34:36.990
or something like that, and
its's the right game move

34:36.990 --> 34:38.990
for you, it's not personal.

34:38.990 --> 34:40.990
That's game.

34:40.990 --> 34:44.990
>> James insinuates he wants
to go after --

34:44.990 --> 34:47.950
>> any other week maybe I
could do something to save

34:47.950 --> 34:48.990
my allies but this week I am
so vulnerable I have to look

34:48.990 --> 34:49.990
after myself.

34:49.990 --> 34:52.990
I am not in a position,
personally, mi just one

34:52.990 --> 34:54.000
person trying to make it in
this game.

34:54.000 --> 34:54.990
I'm similar to you.

34:54.990 --> 34:57.990
I'm not trying to-- you know
what I mean am but whatever

34:57.990 --> 34:59.990
direction you go, I'm
willing to say that I will

34:59.990 --> 34:59.990
be supportive.

34:59.990 --> 35:02.990
As fars alike a deal, what I
could offer, if you don't

35:02.990 --> 35:08.990
put me up, if I am hoh
before final seven, you can

35:08.990 --> 35:13.950
also exclude one person from
being put up on the block by

35:13.950 --> 35:16.990
me in addition to yourself.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.990
>> That's a good deal.

35:18.990 --> 35:19.990
>> Vanessa is a straight
sheert.

35:19.990 --> 35:23.990
She never lied to me that I
know of.

35:23.990 --> 35:24.990
This would be so dumb of me
not to take this she has won

35:24.990 --> 35:25.990
two hohs.

35:25.990 --> 35:28.990
And the way she's going, she
could possibly win a third

35:28.990 --> 35:30.410
one and I need this.

35:30.410 --> 35:32.830
>> You got to make the tough
decision about which side

35:32.830 --> 35:33.990
you trust kind of thing.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.990
You got to go with your gut,
figure out which, who you

35:36.990 --> 35:50.990
trust more.

35:50.990 --> 35:51.990
>> Happy what?

35:51.990 --> 35:54.950
>> Happy --
>> I made a deal with sqlams

35:54.950 --> 35:57.990
that he would keep me and
Clay safe.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.990
But now Becky is coming up
and leting us know that

35:59.990 --> 36:02.990
there is talk upstairs that
this deal means nothing so

36:02.990 --> 36:08.990
we got to talk to him and we
got to figure some stuff out.

36:08.990 --> 36:11.990
>> What's the word, man?

36:11.990 --> 36:14.990
>> You know, just trying to
come up with an elaborate

36:14.990 --> 36:15.000
plan.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.120
>> Well, we want to talk to
you because you and I was

36:18.120 --> 36:19.990
hanging there and made a
deal.

36:19.990 --> 36:21.990
And we just want to make
sure that --

36:21.990 --> 36:23.990
>> it's still good, right.

36:23.990 --> 36:27.990
>> Yeah, when you asked that
it kind of made me like-- well,

36:27.990 --> 36:29.990
are we good or friends or
something.

36:29.990 --> 36:33.410
>> Well, to be honest with
you, this whole last week

36:33.410 --> 36:35.990
Jason deal, we feel like
we're being targeted because

36:35.990 --> 36:39.990
people think that we were
the ones that started this

36:39.990 --> 36:41.990
competition to get Jason
off.

36:41.990 --> 36:42.990
>> We're lucky we're still
here.

36:42.990 --> 36:45.700
>> Yeah, Jason, it is
unfortunate that it

36:45.700 --> 36:45.990
happened.

36:45.990 --> 36:48.290
I guess with that, I didn't
know about till the last

36:48.290 --> 36:48.990
minute.

36:48.990 --> 36:52.120
>> I totally get why that
was so upsetting to y'all,

36:52.120 --> 36:53.990
especially since you found
out that we knew before and

36:53.990 --> 36:55.410
that y'all didn't.

36:55.410 --> 36:55.990
>> Right.

36:55.990 --> 36:58.990
>> That's why like I felt in
the moment that I had to be

36:58.990 --> 37:01.990
like hey, look, please don't
target us.

37:01.990 --> 37:05.990
>> The reason is Jason or
Austin.

37:05.990 --> 37:09.990
>> You do realize Austin
found out he was the target.

37:09.990 --> 37:10.990
>> Right.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.990
>> An Austin began
campaigning.

37:12.990 --> 37:16.990
So who do you think started
this whole role to save

37:16.990 --> 37:23.120
Austin and put somebody else
on the block.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.830
Austin.

37:25.830 --> 37:25.990
>> Right?

37:25.990 --> 37:28.120
I mean --
>> yeah.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.990
>> Clay and Shelli just
don't want to own up to the

37:30.990 --> 37:33.990
fact that they had a huge
part in sending Jason home.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.410
Now it's time to just pretty
much tell them what they

37:36.410 --> 37:36.990
want to hear.

37:36.990 --> 37:39.990
Little do they know they
could be going up this week.

37:39.990 --> 37:43.290
>> If any names were thrown
out, they didn't come from

37:43.290 --> 37:44.990
us.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.990
>> That's like in the past
now.

37:46.990 --> 37:55.700
>> Y'all are good.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.990
>> Definitely tosesing and
turninging can't really

37:57.990 --> 37:57.990
sleep.

37:57.990 --> 37:59.990
The games have been reset.

37:59.990 --> 38:01.990
There is no battle to bloip.

38:01.990 --> 38:04.990
I'm wearing out my options
right now it is definitely a

38:04.990 --> 38:13.410
big decision.

38:13.410 --> 38:14.290
>> Keep with the plan.

38:14.290 --> 38:16.990
>> Whs's that.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.830
>> Definitely giving pause.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.990
I'm thinking of going
straight for the jugular,

38:20.990 --> 38:23.990
just throw Clay and Shelli
up on the block.

38:23.990 --> 38:27.830
>> I can't believe you're
saying this.

38:27.830 --> 38:30.990
>> They are both going to be
pissed at you so just all

38:30.990 --> 38:33.990
right, batt y'all are being
to be mad at me.

38:33.990 --> 38:34.290
Whatever.

38:34.290 --> 38:35.990
They need to be broken up.

38:35.990 --> 38:36.990
>> Yeah.

38:36.990 --> 38:37.990
>> I'll take the heat.

38:37.990 --> 38:41.290
I mean you got to get
blood-- I'm going to get

38:41.290 --> 38:43.540
blood on my hands
regardless.

38:43.540 --> 38:46.990
>> I think everyone will
just keep the-- the same.

38:46.990 --> 38:47.990
>> Exactly.

38:47.990 --> 38:51.990
Shelli and Clay are bad
trouble.

38:51.990 --> 38:53.990
They're a Brandon and
Rachel.

38:53.990 --> 38:56.990
They are going to run
everyone out the house

38:56.990 --> 38:59.120
unless somebody stops them.

38:59.120 --> 38:59.990
>> God.

38:59.990 --> 39:02.990
>> I came into this house to
make big moves.

39:02.990 --> 39:05.990
I'm not scared to get blood
on my hands am I'm going to

39:05.990 --> 39:08.990
wear it like war paint and
if I mack a heavy move it's

39:08.990 --> 39:09.830
got to be now.

39:09.830 --> 39:12.990
>> This is what I have got
to do and I'm pretty set on

39:12.990 --> 39:13.990
this.

39:13.990 --> 39:15.990
>> They're not going to see
it coming.

39:15.990 --> 39:17.990
It is going to hit them like
a bad train

39:27.990 --> 39:29.120
can't get enough of Big Brother

39:29.120 --> 39:31.290
there is never a dull moment

39:31.290 --> 39:34.290
see what's happening inside the
house whenever you want

39:36.990 --> 39:38.990
you know you want to watch!

39:45.990 --> 39:48.990
>> Hey, everybody, it's time
for nomination ceremony.

40:05.290 --> 40:08.990
This is the nomination
ceremony it is my

40:08.990 --> 40:10.990
responsibility as the head
of household to nominate two

40:10.990 --> 40:12.990
house guests for eviction.

40:12.990 --> 40:15.990
I will turning two keys to
lock in my nominations.

40:15.990 --> 40:19.290
And their faces will appear
on the memory wall.

40:19.290 --> 40:31.990
The first house guest I have
nominated is-- .

40:31.990 --> 40:46.830
The next house guest I have
nominated is-- .

40:46.830 --> 40:49.990
I have no natured you, Clay
and you Shelli because there

40:49.990 --> 40:54.990
was some blindsides going on
last week, I was wlind sided

40:54.990 --> 40:56.990
by that as well am Shelli,
you stood up on that wall

40:56.990 --> 40:58.950
and you beasted that
competition and I know will

40:58.950 --> 41:00.950
you go to the end of the sea
with Clay.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.990
I know if I have to take
Clay out I've got to take

41:02.990 --> 41:03.990
you out as well.

41:03.990 --> 41:07.990
As far as our contract that
we had up there, it is up to

41:07.990 --> 41:10.410
my discretion whether that
contract is valid and it's

41:10.410 --> 41:11.990
not up for appeal.

41:11.990 --> 41:14.990
>> I would like to say
though that you did publicly

41:14.990 --> 41:18.990
in front of the entire house
make a deal with me.

41:18.990 --> 41:20.990
So everyone in this house
can know right now that

41:20.990 --> 41:26.990
James is not good for his
word.

41:26.990 --> 41:29.540
>> Clay and hi absolutely
nothing to do with Jason

41:29.540 --> 41:32.990
going up on the block last
week.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.990
And anyone who wants to come
to us and find out the true

41:35.990 --> 41:38.990
story behind what happened,
fair game.

41:38.990 --> 41:47.950
>> This nomination ceremony
is adjourned.

41:47.950 --> 41:50.990
>> When I give somebody my
word, I mean that obviously

41:50.990 --> 41:52.990
with James, isn't the case.

41:52.990 --> 41:55.540
For him to stoop that low
and put up Shelli and myself,

41:55.540 --> 42:02.950
side-by-side, like that's
just-- maybe we're just

42:02.950 --> 42:04.990
naive to think that there's
people in this house that

42:04.990 --> 42:07.990
would play the game like
that.

42:07.990 --> 42:10.000
>> Clay and Shelli are on
the block now, that was

42:10.000 --> 42:11.990
pretty of the hard part.

42:11.990 --> 42:15.990
The other part is make sure
that it stays the same and

42:15.990 --> 42:20.410
my hoh this week has been a
successful week.

42:20.410 --> 42:22.990
>> Throwing me under the bus
watt not only a bad personal

42:22.990 --> 42:24.990
move because I'm their
fraend but it was a bad game

42:24.990 --> 42:25.540
move.

42:25.540 --> 42:29.950
If they have any hope of
surviving the game together,

42:29.950 --> 42:30.990
they're going to need me.

42:30.990 --> 42:32.990
>> I'm just so pissed right
now.

42:32.990 --> 42:35.000
I am so pisesed.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.120
It means everything.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.990
Everything for me or Clay to
win this veto.

42:40.990 --> 42:42.990
That means that one of us
gets to come down.

42:42.990 --> 42:45.990
Somebody else gets to go up
and there is a chance that

42:45.990 --> 42:49.990
we can get this vote to both
stay in this house and both

42:49.990 --> 42:51.990
continue playing this game.

42:51.990 --> 42:55.990
We have got to win this veto
more than anything.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.990
>> Who will win the power of
veto?

42:57.990 --> 43:01.120
And will it be used to save
either Clay or Shelli from

43:01.120 --> 43:01.990
eviction?

43:01.990 --> 43:06.990
Find out Wednesday at 8:00,
7:00 central on "big

43:06.990 --> 43:08.990
