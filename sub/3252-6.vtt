WEBVTT

00:05.560 --> 00:08.480
There's no way out of this.
We're going to die here.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.150
Pass me the vibro-cutters.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.710
They're in my pocket.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.230
Come on then, pass them to me.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.470
In my other jacket. At home.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.830
Why have you got have two jackets -
is one of them faulty?

00:18.880 --> 00:21.630
Look, I don't have the vibro-cutters.
If I had the vibro-cutters,

00:21.680 --> 00:23.830
I wouldn't be able to pass you
the vibro-cutters.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.950
We're going to starve
to death out here.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.670
Of course we won't starve.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.400
The sand piranhas will get us
long before that.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.830
Hiya. Sorry I'm late.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.070
You're not, but you are brown,
you're very brown.

00:38.120 --> 00:42.150
~ You weren't that brown this morning.
~ Sunbed. I'll get 'em in. Usual?

00:42.200 --> 00:44.070
Fish people.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.590
What are they like?

00:45.640 --> 00:48.320
Fish. And people. Come and see.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.390
~ How's you?
~ Evening. Nice frock.

00:53.440 --> 00:55.480
~ It's a bit wet.
~ Freak shower.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.350
Is that seaweed?

00:59.400 --> 01:00.840
I said freak.

01:04.400 --> 01:08.670
~ How much further? ~ TARDIS has got
to be round this corner.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.870
~ I hate soldiers.
Don't you hate soldiers? ~ Yeah.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.520
Just keep running!

01:15.200 --> 01:18.640
~ Oh, yeah. Danny. Hiya.
~ Morning. Ready to run?

01:24.880 --> 01:28.870
I can't keep doing this.
I can't do it.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.560
Yes, I can, I can do it,
of course I can do it.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.160
I've got it all under control.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.470
So, where we off to?

01:39.520 --> 01:42.440
Clara, you... You look lovely today.
Have you had a wash?

01:45.120 --> 01:47.790
~ Why are you being nice?
~ Because it works on you.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.790
Listen, I'm sorry but there's going
to be no trip today.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.390
I'm sorry. Er, I've got to do
a thing. It might take a while.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.390
~ What thing? ~ Just a thing.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.590
You're being mysterious,
and do you know what means?

02:00.640 --> 02:02.070
I'm a man of mystery.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.430
Hmm. It means that you are
a very clever man

02:04.480 --> 02:07.190
making the mistake,
common to very clever people,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.750
of assuming that
everybody else is stupid.

02:09.800 --> 02:10.870
Where are you going?

02:10.919 --> 02:12.870
Undercover. Deep cover.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.310
~ Can you do deep cover?
~ What do you mean? ~ Have you seen you?

02:15.360 --> 02:16.710
Of course I can do deep cover!

02:16.760 --> 02:18.400
Where? The Magic Circle?

02:20.160 --> 02:21.790
I'll see you when I see you.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.880
When's that?

02:24.280 --> 02:25.880
When I see you.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.280
Hmm...

02:33.000 --> 02:36.510
Hmm... I'll be sure to have a wash.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.920
Excellent.
I was meaning to bring it up.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074

02:55.920 --> 02:58.960
You lot! Not here...over there.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.110
Morning, Mr Pink.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.070
Morning, Courtney.
And good morning, Miss Oswald.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.870
Morning, Mr Pink.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.310
~ Do they know?
~ Possibly - they're children.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.430
It's like they've got
minds of their own. Are you OK?

03:18.480 --> 03:20.310
Yeah, course I'm OK.
Why wouldn't I be OK?

03:20.360 --> 03:23.670
~ I dunno. Every time I see you,
it's like you're... ~ What?

03:23.720 --> 03:25.870
In a rush. In a state.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.710
In a space helmet, one time.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.030
Sorry, er, I've had a...thing

03:30.080 --> 03:32.950
and, er, the thing's gone
so I'm all yours.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.710
~ What thing? What's gone? ~ Nothing.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.910
It's like you're trying
to be mysterious.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.400
I'm not stupid, you know.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.110
The next few days
are all about you. I promise.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.190
Which means, Jo, you'll have to
cover for 8/4M in L3.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.870
Hold on, there is
just one more thing.

03:54.920 --> 03:56.870
Atif's off sick,
so we've got a newbie,

03:56.920 --> 03:58.190
I did ask him to come along.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.320
Ah, here he is.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.470
I'm the new caretaker. John Smith.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.070
Welcome to Coal Hill, Mr Smith.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.950
Thanks.
Yes, John Smith's the name.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.839
But, you know, here's a thing,
most people just call me the Doctor.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.830
So, if anybody needs me,
just, you know, give me a shout.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.150
I'll be in the storeroom
just getting the lie of the land.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.510
Yes, no-one's taking
any notice at all.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.310
Absolutely good news because
it means I must be coming across

05:10.360 --> 05:14.310
just as an absolutely boring
human being like you.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.400
Deep cover. Deep cover.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.070
~ Do you know him? ~ Know who?

05:21.120 --> 05:24.470
~ The caretaker, Smith. "The Doctor."
~ Never seen him before in my life.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.310
Bit intense looking.
Did you see those eyebrows?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.550
Did he wink at you?

05:28.600 --> 05:30.710
No, I think that was just
a sort of general wink.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.070
He winked at everybody.
It was a general welcoming wink.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.070
Ah, I have, erm, left some marking.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.680
Assembly. Chop-chop. Off you pop.
Catch you in a bit. Excuse me.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.350
~ So, you recognised me, then.
~ You're wearing a different coat.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.350
~ But you saw straight through that.
~ Deep cover in my school? Why?

05:50.400 --> 05:52.270
Where's Atif,
what have you done with him?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.710
He's fine, hypnotised,
he thinks he's got the 'flu.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.870
Also a flying car and three wives.
It's going to be a rude awakening.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.790
Is it aliens? Oh, my God, is that
why you're here? Are there aliens?

06:01.840 --> 06:06.230
~ It's assembly, you better get going.
Go and worship something.
~ Are there aliens in this school?

06:06.280 --> 06:09.430
Listen, it's lovely talking to you,
but I've really got to get on.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.030
~ I'm a caretaker now.
Look, I've got a brush. ~ Doctor,
is there an alien in this school?

06:13.080 --> 06:15.470
Yes. Me. Now, go.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.830
The walls need sponging
and there's a sinister puddle.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.070
You can't do this.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.150
You cannot pass yourself off
as a real person among actual people.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.470
I lived among otters
once for a month.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.790
Well, I sulked. River and I,
we had this big fight...

06:27.840 --> 06:32.000
~ Human beings are not otters!
~ Exactly, it'll be even easier.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.680
One question.
And you will answer this question.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.350
Are the kids safe?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.750
No. Nobody is safe.

06:43.800 --> 06:47.470
But soon the answer will be
yes, everybody is safe,

06:47.520 --> 06:50.950
if you let me get on. Now...

06:51.000 --> 06:54.430
pretend you don't know me,
stay out of my way.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.310
The less you know, the better.
I'll explain it all later.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.550
~ Go and sing with the otters.
~ I hate you.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.840
That's fine,
that's a perfectly normal reaction.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.150
Basically, you've to get
that guy on the block

07:09.200 --> 07:11.430
and stop that other one
shooting him. It's so sick.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.470
I-I got that guy.
That was, like, six months ago.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.230
~ You actually have to flick it
that way. ~ Nah, but I'm saying...

07:17.280 --> 07:18.440
You Coal Hill kids?

07:19.920 --> 07:23.110
~ Yes, so what if we are?
~ Then get to Coal Hill.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.470
We've got a free period, mate.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.950
You want me to take your names?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.080
Come on.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.040
This is unfair, mate.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.960
Always come in threes.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.800
Oi! I know you're in there.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.400
Hello? I'm a police officer.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.920
There's no point hiding.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.760
Do you hear me?

08:09.920 --> 08:11.630
Come on, kiddo.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.830
Five-stop-intruder.
Five-stop-intruder.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.590
Turn your game off,
it's time for school.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.160
Come on! Stop messing about!

08:23.360 --> 08:26.590
Problem-solution-DESTROY.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.669
..though unheard by Lydia,
was caught by Elizabeth,

08:40.720 --> 08:44.440
and as it assured
her that Darcy was...

08:46.480 --> 08:50.470
~ You all right, Miss Oswald?
~ Yes, Kelvin, I'm fine, you carry on.

08:50.520 --> 08:55.950
Every feeling of displeasure
against the former
was so sharpened...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.630
Can I help you, Mr Smith?

08:58.680 --> 09:01.470
~ Wrong. ~ I'm sorry?

09:01.520 --> 09:05.430
On the board. Wrong. Wrong.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.510
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You don't do this.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.910
You are the caretaker,
this is not what you do.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.670
~ Just taking care. ~ Not your area!

09:12.720 --> 09:16.270
Jane Austen wrote
Pride and Prejudice in 1796.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.830
This is Mr Smith, the temporary
caretaker, and he's a bit confused.

09:20.880 --> 09:25.550
Not in 1797, because she didn't
have the time. She was so busy...

09:25.600 --> 09:27.630
Oh, I suppose she was your
bezzie mate, was she?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.350
And you went on holidays together

09:29.400 --> 09:31.390
and then you got kidnapped
by Boggons from space

09:31.440 --> 09:34.360
and then you all formed
a band and met Buddy Holly.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.670
No, I read the book.
There's a bio at the back.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.720
Get down.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.360
~ Boggons? ~ Go!

09:47.160 --> 09:49.910
Right, that's it. Well done, Kelvin.
Get going.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.350
See you all in a couple of days.
Thanks very much.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.750
Miss, what about our homework?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.720
Who asks for homework? Amateur.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.030
~ Miss Oswald...
~ Hello, Tobias, can't really stop.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.030
I'm in the football team
against Durrants on Thursday.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.070
Sorry, but can I go early
from English Thursday afternoon?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.110
Tobias, you can do whatever you want.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.910
~ Clara, can I grab a quick word?
~ Actually, I, erm...

10:17.960 --> 10:21.150
Two weeks Saturday, the fete,
can I put you down for tombola

10:21.200 --> 10:23.110
and the raffle?
James H can't cover it now.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.150
His wife's going into hospital.
Hip replacement. Constant agony.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.510
Great.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.390
No, awful. That's terrible. Awful.
I hope she'll be OK.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.560
Erm, I'll do anything.
Anything. OK. Bye.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.110
Miss Oswald, Katie Sharps says
I pulled her hair in Biology.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.350
Courtney, you are big enough
to look after yourself.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.750
Next class, jog on,
I need to talk to Mr Pink.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.990
~ Ozzie loves the Squaddie.
~ What was that? ~ Nothing.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.870
Of course, Danny Pink here
is your man, Mr Smith.

10:48.920 --> 10:52.070
Five years' military experience,
sergeant, here and Afghan,

10:52.120 --> 10:54.950
so electrics, boilers, if you need
a hand, give him a shout.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.950
I-I've helped Atif with
a couple of things.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.080
I'm sure I won't need you, Sergeant.
Fully qualified.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.710
~ You best get back to your PE class.
~ Oh, I teach maths.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.350
~ Do you? What, in emergencies?
~ No. I'm a maths teacher.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.670
Yeah, he's a maths teacher...

11:10.720 --> 11:12.390
Mohammed, put that down!

11:12.440 --> 11:14.830
How does that work?
What if the kids have questions?

11:14.880 --> 11:17.870
~ About what? ~ Maths.
~ I answer them. I'm a maths teacher.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.270
But he said you were a soldier.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.830
Yeah. I was a soldier,
now I'm a maths teacher.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.190
But what about all the PE?

11:24.240 --> 11:26.590
I don't teach PE.
I'm not a PE teacher.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.510
Sorry, that seems very unlikely.

11:28.560 --> 11:33.510
Er, excuse me. Mr Pink,
I think class 9M4 are waiting.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.270
Yes, you better run along, Sergeant.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.350
That ball isn't going to
kick itself, is it?

11:37.400 --> 11:39.720
I-I'm not a PE teacher,
I'm a maths teacher.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.350
Nope, sorry, no,
I can't retain that.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.480
I've tried, it's just not going in.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.070
So...Pink.
The name remind you of anything?

11:56.120 --> 11:58.240
Yeah. The colour.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.550
Colonel Orson Pink?

12:00.600 --> 12:03.150
The guy we met
at the end of the universe.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.750
Oh, yeah. OK, same name, doesn't
look anything like him though.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.990
Looks very like him.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.910
Does he? I don't know.
Who remembers a PE teacher?

12:10.960 --> 12:12.000
Never mind.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.390
What are you doing?
What...? What's in there?

12:15.440 --> 12:18.070
So...is he here then?

12:18.120 --> 12:19.230
Is who here?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.950
The one you keep going on
serious dates with.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.870
If he is, are you going to start
talking like a normal human being?

12:24.920 --> 12:27.390
~ I promise I won't. I'm being nice.
~ Doctor...?

12:27.440 --> 12:30.150
~ Clara. Got this period free, yes?
~ No. Yes.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.680
~ Great. Shakespeare.
~ Sorry, what, Adrian?

12:34.280 --> 12:37.400
Oh...I see.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.790
~ You see what?
~ Nothing. Nothing at all.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.230
Excuse me. We have to
talk about The Tempest,

12:44.280 --> 12:47.590
in light of the changes
to the sixth form Shakespeare
module, blah-de-blah...

12:47.640 --> 12:49.200
Yes. Sorry, of course.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.510
Yes, yes, no, of course,
of course, yes.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.910
Don't mind this old man.
You two kids just pop off together.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.230
Why are you talking like an idiot?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.760
I'm a caretaker, don't mind me.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.350
What we have to get across, I feel,

13:06.400 --> 13:11.390
is that fascinating enigma
of its...not-finishedness.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.000
Mmm, yes, good point, Ade.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.680
Oh, Clara.

13:30.880 --> 13:35.640
What does that mean? Kids.
What's the matter with kids today?

13:46.720 --> 13:48.110
Hey, I said you could play chess,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.550
I did not say you could play
football on the chessboard.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.430
Jack, Morgan, come on,
help me out, clear it up.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.280
And one for luck.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.070
OK. Now we're in business.

14:12.120 --> 14:16.760
Let's see the lie of the land.
Time to see what's going on.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.280
Hello?

14:22.520 --> 14:24.080
Oi.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.350
What are you doing?
Are you in there?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.350
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

14:29.400 --> 14:32.590
who's the most dangerous
of them all?

14:32.640 --> 14:36.310
There's been a spillage in
Geography, I need some paper towels.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.550
Can't you read?

14:37.600 --> 14:39.110
Course I can read. Read what?

14:39.160 --> 14:41.910
The door. It says, "Keep Out."

14:41.960 --> 14:43.720
No, it says, "Go Away Humans."

14:44.960 --> 14:46.030
Oh, so it does.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.190
Never lose your temper
in the middle of a door sign.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.590
What was you doing in there?
What's that box?

14:50.640 --> 14:54.950
A caretaker's box.
Every caretaker has their own box.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.230
It says, "Police".

14:56.280 --> 14:58.950
Exactly, there's a policeman
in there, in case of emergencies

14:59.000 --> 14:59.990
and children.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.430
~ Towels, there, g-g-go.
~ What was that green glow?

15:02.480 --> 15:04.870
There was a green glow
coming from in there.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.630
~ What was it? ~ Of course there was.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.710
What's a policeman
without a death ray?

15:09.760 --> 15:11.470
Oh, listen, there's the bell,
off you go.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.510
~ Haven't you got shoplifting to do?
~ I'm going to tell the Headmaster.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.910
Oh, yes, well, fine. Cut along,
you're running out of time.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.750
~ For what? ~ Everything. Human beings
have incredibly short life spans.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.870
Frankly, you should all be
in a permanent state of panic.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.910
~ Tick tock, tick tock.
~ You're weird.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.750
Yes, I am. What about you?

15:28.800 --> 15:30.440
I'm a disruptive influence.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.070
~ Good to meet you. ~ And you(!)

15:34.120 --> 15:36.760
Now get lost. OK.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.870
Hello, miss, love to the Squaddie.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.990
Sorry, what did you say?

15:44.040 --> 15:45.430
What was she doing in here?

15:45.480 --> 15:49.430
Paper towels. Now, I imagine
you've many questions.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.390
Fire away,
I won't answer any of them.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.390
~ What were they like? ~ What were
who like? ~ The others before me.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.150
Did they let you get away
with this kind of thing?

15:57.200 --> 16:00.030
~ This school is in danger.
~ Well, it's lucky I'm here then.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.550
~ From you. ~ Me? ~ You wouldn't be here if
there wasn't an alien threat nearby.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.510
Your strategy for dealing with it
involves endangering this school.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.910
~ You don't know that.
~ I don't know anything because
you haven't told me anything,

16:09.960 --> 16:14.400
which means I wouldn't approve,
which means you are
endangering this school.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.870
What's that?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.350
It's a scanner. I'm scanning.
Why do I keep you around?

16:21.400 --> 16:25.470
Because the alternative would be
developing a conscience of your own.
Scanning for what?

16:25.520 --> 16:27.910
Any alien technology in this
vicinity should show up.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.190
I used to have a teacher
exactly like you once.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.880
You still do. Pay attention.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.710
What the hell is it?!

16:36.760 --> 16:38.910
A Skovox Blitzer,

16:38.960 --> 16:41.950
one of the deadliest
killing machines ever created.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.670
Probably homed in here
because of artron emissions.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.910
You've had enough of them
in this area over the years.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.720
There's enough explosive
in its armoury to take out
the whole planet.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.750
Then leave it alone.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.990
Sooner or later it will
creep from its hidey-hole

16:57.040 --> 17:00.790
and some military idiot
will try to attack it.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.200
The world is full of PE teachers.

17:06.359 --> 17:11.790
So, your insanely dangerous plan is?

17:11.839 --> 17:14.109
A new watch.
Tiny bit disappointed.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.040
This is a very special watch.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.079
Doctor?

17:25.560 --> 17:29.280
Oi! Did you just flick my nose?

17:31.960 --> 17:35.270
You're invisible.
Oh, my God, that's incredible!

17:35.320 --> 17:38.190
Correct. I am invisible
and I am incredible.

17:38.240 --> 17:42.590
~ It's simply a matter of reversing
light waves. Hang on, I'm coming
back. ~ All right, where are you?

17:42.640 --> 17:46.430
So, I give the Blitzer a tiny whiff
of non-threatening alien tech,

17:46.480 --> 17:49.510
I lead it back here, but I don't
want it to scan me, hence invisible.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.150
So you're leading the thing
here? To a school? My school?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.950
"MY school"? Oh, that is telling.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.390
This is the only suitably
empty place in the area.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.630
I've set up a circle of time mines
around the school.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.750
Chronodyne generators.
Bit unstable.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.270
I switch them on, the Blitzer gets
sucked into a big old time vortex,

18:07.320 --> 18:10.070
billions of years into the future.
Dead easy. Tiny bit boring.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.910
~ I'll need a book and a sandwich.
~ And me. You're not doing this alone.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.670
I don't need you this time.
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.070
We'll go somewhere nice.
Ancient Egypt. Crocodilopolis.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.230
They worship a big crocodile there,
so the name is a useful coincidence.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.400
Go and canoodle with your boyfriend.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.070
Come on. I wasn't born yesterday,
far from it.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.590
You did recognise him.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.390
Possibly reminded me of a certain
dashing young time traveller.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.910
Of course you recognised him.

18:42.960 --> 18:47.470
Sorry. Stupid.
I-I underestimated you.

18:47.520 --> 18:51.430
~ Easily done, there's a lot
to estimate. ~ And you, you like him?

18:51.480 --> 18:55.270
Yes, I like him. Very, very much.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.960
Go home and canoodle.
Doctor's orders. Come on.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.750
~ Just this once, I'm doing
what I'm told. ~ Oh, sing hosanna.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.160
So easy.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.790
Miss Oswald.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.950
~ Ah, Mr... Mr Pink.
~ Still on for tonight?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.630
Cos you had your
"I'm about to cancel" frown on.

19:24.680 --> 19:25.990
There's a specific frown?

19:26.040 --> 19:29.470
And I was going to say, it's OK,
I might have a thing, so...

19:29.520 --> 19:30.600
A thing?

19:33.320 --> 19:36.750
~ Tomorrow instead?
~ Tomorrow's parents' evening.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.190
Not all evening.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.720
No. Not all evening.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.710
What do you think of him?

19:44.760 --> 19:47.350
Er, who? The caretaker?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.750
Where did he come from?
What was he before?

19:49.800 --> 19:52.270
He doesn't seem like a caretaker.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.560
Well, he speaks very highly of you.

19:59.560 --> 20:02.360
Anyway. Good night, Miss Oswald.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.560
Good night...Mr Pink.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.600
And we're off.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.600
Home, sweet home.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.520
Canoodling cancelled,
if you need a hand...

20:56.560 --> 20:58.510
Doctor?

20:58.560 --> 20:59.840
You invisible?

21:02.280 --> 21:04.470
I am so going to confiscate
that watch.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.280
Where are you, my sleeping beauty?

21:15.800 --> 21:17.800
Gotcha! Let's dance!

21:19.920 --> 21:21.910
Doctor?

21:21.960 --> 21:23.800
Where are you?

21:26.840 --> 21:27.880
Hello?

21:35.840 --> 21:37.590
Nine-stop-query-rescan.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.640
Target-reacquired-success-success.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.550
Come on, come on.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.960
Gangway!

21:48.640 --> 21:50.400
Not far now. Come on.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.110
Nine-stop-parsing-data-pursue.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.240
Bingo.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.680
Target-reacquired.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.200
Hello?

22:09.280 --> 22:14.350
What? Red? Red. No. No-no-no!

22:14.400 --> 22:18.190
Range-one-point-four-nine-scan
complete-problem-problem.

22:18.240 --> 22:23.350
Listen. I'm unarmed.
I'm peaceful. Do you understand?

22:23.400 --> 22:25.510
I-I know that you shouldn't be
on this planet

22:25.560 --> 22:27.150
but I can help you with that. I...

22:27.200 --> 22:29.270
Problem-solution-DESTROY.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.390
I want a word with you.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.960
~ Get back!
~ Problem-solution-DESTROY.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.560
Get away from me!

22:44.080 --> 22:46.630
Temporal-disrupt.

22:46.680 --> 22:50.910
Warning-warning. Temporal-failure.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.190
Doctor, stop!

22:53.240 --> 22:54.870
Doctor!

22:54.920 --> 22:58.280
Warning-system-failure.
Abort. Abort.

23:08.760 --> 23:13.400
Oh, oh, well done, PE,
brilliant work(!)

23:14.800 --> 23:17.350
"What's this?
A chronodyne generator?

23:17.400 --> 23:19.750
"I'll just deactivate that, shall I?

23:19.800 --> 23:22.590
"I've got a swimming certificate
so that qualifies me

23:22.640 --> 23:24.150
"to meddle with higher technology.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.310
"Never mind that some people are
actually trying to save the planet.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.790
"Oh, no. There's only room
in my head for cross-country
and the offside rule."

23:31.840 --> 23:34.790
~ Danny, what are you doing here?
~ I was checking up on him.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.720
He's been up to something, fiddling
with the electric, but what the...?!

23:39.840 --> 23:42.000
No. What...?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.990
Did you see that thing?
Tell me you saw that thing.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.670
I saw the thing, yeah. Doctor, are we
safe, is the planet safe? It's gone?

23:49.720 --> 23:52.710
Yes, yes, yes, yes, for the moment.
But the thing is, you see,

23:52.760 --> 23:56.350
the chronodyne generators
have to be precisely aligned
to generate the vortex,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.430
but the sergeant here,
he went and moved one.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.640
But the chronodyne worked, it's gone.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.590
But not far enough.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.590
The vortex will open here again,
but not in a billion years.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.030
Then when?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.670
Er, 74 hours. Three days.

24:12.720 --> 24:17.670
Three days to think of something new
because now it knows what to expect,

24:17.720 --> 24:23.800
now it's scanned me and will kill
me on sight, thanks to PE here.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.070
Clara, why are you talking
to him like that?

24:29.120 --> 24:33.710
Why are you using words
like chronodyne?

24:33.760 --> 24:36.360
Was that thing a space thing?

24:40.720 --> 24:43.320
Oh, my God, you're from space.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.600
You're a spacewoman.
You said you were from Blackpool.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.150
It's a play! For the summer fete.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.590
~ It's a what? ~ Yes, it's a play.
Shut up, it is a play.

24:58.640 --> 25:02.750
We are rehearsing a play.
Sh! Sh! Sh! A surprise play!

25:02.800 --> 25:06.430
And, erm, you see, the vortex thing
is-is a lighting effect.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.510
Very clever.

25:07.560 --> 25:12.430
And that thing is-is one of the kids.
In fancy dress.

25:12.480 --> 25:16.870
Really...really good fancy dress.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.230
How stupid do you think I am?

25:18.280 --> 25:20.510
I'm willing to put a number on it.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.960
I'm not a moron, Clara.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.920
And he's not the caretaker.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.670
He's...your dad.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.830
Your space dad.

25:31.880 --> 25:35.510
Oh...genius.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.510
That is really, really
brilliant reasoning.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.430
How can you think I'm her dad when
we both look exactly the same age?

25:42.480 --> 25:44.550
~ We do not look the same age.
~ I was being kind.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.310
~ Right, I'll hypnotise him,
I'll erase his memory. ~ Doctor, stop!

25:47.360 --> 25:49.510
~ Tiny brain, won't take a moment.
~ He's my boyfriend.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.550
Well, I'll try not to
erase the whole thing.
I'll leave the bits that...

25:52.600 --> 25:56.390
He's my boyfriend. I thought
you'd figured this out.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.430
~ Him? ~ Yes, him.
~ No, he's not.

25:58.480 --> 26:02.110
~ Yes, he is. ~ Yes, I am.
~ But he's a PE teacher.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.790
You wouldn't go out
with a PE teacher.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.550
It's a mistake.
You've made a boyfriend error.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.070
I am not a PE teacher.
I am a maths teacher!

26:09.120 --> 26:11.310
You're a soldier.
Why would you go out with a soldier?

26:11.360 --> 26:14.120
~ Why not get a dog or a big plant?
~ Because I love him!

26:22.240 --> 26:24.990
Why would you say that?
Is this part of the surprise play?

26:25.040 --> 26:28.150
There is no surprise play.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.150
Oh, it's a roller coaster
with you tonight, isn't it?

26:31.200 --> 26:33.310
What about the handsome one
with the bow tie?

26:33.360 --> 26:35.670
Adrian? No. He's just a friend
and not my type.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.190
Clara, are you going to
explain any of this?

26:38.240 --> 26:39.880
Who is this guy?

26:42.400 --> 26:44.040
The Doctor is...

26:47.080 --> 26:51.790
~ Go on. ~ Yes, explain. Who is he?
Why have you never mentioned him?

26:51.840 --> 26:56.000
Because...he's an alien.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.400
~ Are you an alien?
~ No-no-no, I'm still from Blackpool.

27:03.280 --> 27:06.110
Me and the Doctor,
we travel through time and space.

27:06.160 --> 27:09.550
Exhibit A.

27:09.600 --> 27:14.990
It's called a TARDIS, but it's
disguised as an old police phone box.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.350
(It's bigger on the inside.)

27:16.400 --> 27:19.080
And it's bigger on the inside
than the outside.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.920
Voila.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.840
And we travel the universe in it.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.470
What about that thing?
Did you bring that here?

27:44.520 --> 27:47.590
No, I'm going to protect you
from that thing.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.510
You said it was coming back.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.870
Yes, it is coming back.
Thanks to you.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.470
This is a school.
We have to evacuate, call the Army.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.350
And that is the most dangerous
thing right there.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.230
~ Are you sure hypnotising
is not on the menu? ~ Yes.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.590
We need to get help.
This is an emergency.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.750
Take him away, shut him up,
shut him down, up or down,
it doesn't matter to me.

28:08.800 --> 28:12.230
~ I've got a lot of work to do. Again.
~ Will you be OK?

28:12.280 --> 28:16.710
Why wouldn't I be OK? I was fine
till you two blundered in.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.110
Am I just being ignored?

28:18.160 --> 28:21.310
Come on, Danny.
It's all right, it's all fine.

28:21.360 --> 28:25.510
You'll be OK.
Let's get those legs moving...

28:25.560 --> 28:28.070
that's it, down those stairs.
Yep, that's it.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.350
This can all be explained
and everything will be fine.

28:31.400 --> 28:35.350
And when this is all over,
you can finish the job.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.710
How do you mean?

28:36.760 --> 28:41.160
Well, you've explained me to him.
You haven't explained him to me.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.600
What do you think?

29:00.080 --> 29:01.640
Say something.

29:05.080 --> 29:11.680
So...there's an alien,
who used to look like Adrian.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.510
Then he turned
into a Scottish caretaker

29:16.560 --> 29:19.470
and every now and then, when I'm not
looking, you elope with him.

29:19.520 --> 29:23.750
~ I don't elope.
~ Do you love him? ~ No.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.080
Really had enough of the lies.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.150
~ Not in that way.
~ What other way is there?

29:30.200 --> 29:32.150
~ You know what I mean.
~ I don't know what you mean.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.240
I know what you tell me,
which isn't always the truth.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.920
~ Danny... ~ Why do you do it?

29:42.600 --> 29:44.680
Why do you fly off in the box
with him?

29:45.920 --> 29:48.520
The truth, please, just this once.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.280
Because...it's amazing.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.880
Because...I see wonders.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.520
OK.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.480
What are you thinking?

30:17.880 --> 30:19.280
That's a good question.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.510
It's funny, you only really know
what someone thinks of you,

30:25.560 --> 30:27.680
when you know what lies
they've told you.

30:28.760 --> 30:33.910
You say you've seen wonders,
you've seen amazing things,

30:33.960 --> 30:36.160
and you kept them secret.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.080
From me.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.640
So, what do you think of me, Clara?

30:45.760 --> 30:49.390
~ Please, tell me how I fix this.
~ I just want to know who you are.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.680
You know who I am.

30:51.920 --> 30:56.760
When you're with him.
When you're with the Doctor.

31:07.840 --> 31:11.190
OK, I think we've just got time
before parents' evening.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.670
An invisibility watch?
Not even a ring.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.710
Press the button on the side,
you're invisible.

31:15.760 --> 31:18.030
You'll see me with the Doctor,
the other me.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.280
The exactly the same other me. OK?

31:28.520 --> 31:31.440
Afternoon.
Thanks for keeping out of my way.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.430
You've not brought Dave with you,
I hope.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.080
His name's Danny. And no, I haven't.

31:39.880 --> 31:43.030
I've explained it all to him. He gets
it, he took it all really well.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.400
Pass me that synestic.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.830
So, when the Blitzer comes back,
are you going to catch him with that?

31:52.880 --> 31:56.030
It'll be a long, fiddly job. It's
going to take me at least 24 hours.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.830
Even longer if people keep talking
to me, so do keep going.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.710
If it comes back Thursday night,
are you sure about that?
Cos you said chronodyne is unstable.

32:02.760 --> 32:05.480
If you want bother someone,
go and bother PE.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.920
He's a maths teacher.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.720
~ That's a shame, I like maths.
~ Not a soldier.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.160
Interesting.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.510
What is?

32:22.560 --> 32:24.070
I'm bored.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.950
Let's go somewhere fun,
what do you say?

32:26.000 --> 32:28.910
Do you want to see the Thames
frozen over? Oh, those frost fairs.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.750
You can't. The Skovox thing.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.230
It's a time machine.
We can get back straightaway,
like we always do on your dates.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.510
Just make sure you don't
get yourself a tan or anything,
or lose a limb.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.150
I don't think we should,
not this time.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.750
You've never said no before.
Not even in the middle of dinner.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.630
Remember you had to eat two meals
in a row?

32:43.680 --> 32:47.590
I just think,
with the school in danger...

32:47.640 --> 32:49.910
~ Danny! Why are you...?
~ He already knows I'm here.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.870
That's why he's talking like that.
He's being clever.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.950
Now you mention it,
being a Time Lord,

32:55.000 --> 32:58.470
I can feel a light-shield aura
when it's right next to me.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.190
"Time Lord"! Might have known.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.430
Might have known WHAT?

33:03.480 --> 33:06.110
The accent's good, but you can
always spot the aristocracy.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.470
~ It's in the...attitude. ~ Danny...

33:09.520 --> 33:11.270
Now, Time Lords,
do you salute those?

33:11.320 --> 33:13.910
~ Definitely not. ~ Sir!

33:13.960 --> 33:15.870
And you do not call me sir.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.750
As you wish, sir. Absolutely, sir.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.710
~ And you can get out of my TARDIS!
~ Immediately, sir.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.710
Doctor, this is stupid,
this is unfair!

33:23.760 --> 33:27.950
One thing, Clara. I'm a soldier,
guilty as charged. You see him?

33:28.000 --> 33:29.950
~ He's an officer.
~ I am not an officer!

33:30.000 --> 33:32.030
I'm the one who carries you
out of the fire.

33:32.080 --> 33:34.190
~ He's the one who lights it.
~ Out. Now.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.960
~ Right away, sir? Straight now? ~ Yes.
~ Am I dismissed? ~ Yes, you are!

33:39.520 --> 33:42.790
That's him. Look at him, right now.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.720
That's who he is.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.800
On balance,
I think that went quite well.

34:02.120 --> 34:06.280
Danny...it's not time to go home yet.
It's parents' evening.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.750
Humans.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.150
I never learn.

34:14.199 --> 34:15.560
What's in the box?

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
It's not really a policeman, is it?

34:22.960 --> 34:27.120
You want to know what's in that box?
I'll tell you what's in that box.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.989
It's a time machine,
it also travels in space,

34:32.040 --> 34:36.110
and it usually contains a man who
just wants to get on with his work

34:36.159 --> 34:38.389
of preventing the end of the world,

34:38.440 --> 34:42.110
but keeps being interrupted
by boring little humans.

34:42.159 --> 34:45.239
Cool. So, that's really a spaceship?

34:46.800 --> 34:49.030
I'm serious,
I'm trying to save this planet.

34:49.080 --> 34:52.670
End of the world for me tonight,
whatever you do. Parents' evening.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.469
Is your name really
Disruptive Influence?

34:55.520 --> 34:58.470
Courtney Woods. Can I go in space?

34:58.520 --> 35:01.030
I'll let you know.
I may have a vacancy.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.520
But not right now.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.920
Two days? I can do it.

35:15.280 --> 35:20.230
Right, are we quorate?
Time to admit the hordes.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.110
And look who's
at the front of the queue.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.590
~ Who are they?
~ Courtney Woods' mum and dad.

35:24.640 --> 35:30.040
~ Can someone else do them first?
~ No problem, Ade. I can cope with
anything tonight. ~ Oh, happy days(!)

36:04.400 --> 36:08.190
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

36:08.240 --> 36:12.550
I would say yes, I'm afraid Courtney
is a disruptive influence.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.430
Yeah, but last year you said
she was a VERY disruptive influence.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.920
So, I suppose that counts
as an improvement.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.990
Excuse me, I think
the caretaker wants me.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.710
Sorry, Mrs Christodolou,
I think the caretaker wants me too.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.150
What about my Angelina?

36:34.200 --> 36:36.630
Yeah, she's great, yeah,
a really great girl, A-plus,

36:36.680 --> 36:39.510
ten out of ten,
top of the class. Sorry.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.520
Although, actually,
handwriting could be better.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.790
I'm sure they'll be
back in a moment.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.670
Looks like our Courtney
was right about those two.

36:51.720 --> 36:54.430
~ What's happening?
~ Clara, the vortex is opening.

36:54.480 --> 36:58.070
~ You said Thursday night.
Hall, quick. ~ PE, shut up.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.830
Clara, it'll scan the area,

36:59.880 --> 37:02.230
if it gets to parents' evening,
it'll kill them all.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.310
We've got to evacuate.
SHUT UP!

37:04.360 --> 37:05.840
Quickly. What do I do?

37:07.760 --> 37:09.990
It'll be here any second.
Get to the hall.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.790
Give it some squirts of
helicon energy, setting number 41,

37:12.840 --> 37:15.230
no more than three seconds each,
random pulses.

37:15.280 --> 37:18.310
Distract it, then you lead it away
from the hall, give me two minutes.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.390
~ Then what?
~ Just run straight to the TARDIS.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.630
But your gadget isn't ready yet.
24 hours, you said.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.950
Yes, well, I've revised that down to
two minutes. Probably. Clara, go.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.990
~ On my way.
~ You're using her like a decoy?

37:28.040 --> 37:30.270
No, not like a decoy. As a decoy.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.870
Don't they teach you anything
at stupid school?

37:32.920 --> 37:34.790
Well, is there anything I can do?

37:34.840 --> 37:37.230
Yes, yes, and this is very,
very important.

Me, what can I do?

Oh, my God, you were so brilliant.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.240
Well, yeah, I was OK, wasn't I?

39:50.320 --> 39:53.270
I was behind you
every step of the way.

39:53.320 --> 39:55.120
Had to make sure you were safe.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.520
You OK?

39:59.360 --> 40:00.680
OK.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.400
Just "OK"?

40:04.440 --> 40:06.270
It's all right, it doesn't matter.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.630
I don't need him to like me.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.190
It doesn't matter
if he likes me or hates me.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.310
I just need to do
exactly one thing for you.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.080
Doctor, am I right?

40:20.040 --> 40:21.590
Yes.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.160
What? What one thing?

40:24.680 --> 40:26.550
I need to be good enough for you.

40:26.600 --> 40:30.320
That's why he's angry.
Just in case I'm not.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.760
He, er... He did just
save the whole world.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.120
Yeah, yeah.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.280
Good start.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.070
Farewell, Skovox Blitzer.
Have a nice war.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.160
So, Courtney Woods, impressed yet?

40:58.560 --> 41:01.590
Actually, I'm feeling a bit ill.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.790
Ah, it can be a bit overwhelming.

41:03.840 --> 41:08.310
But look - the Olveron Cluster.

41:08.360 --> 41:13.640
A million stars,
100 million inhabited planets.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.440
Ah, yes, there has been a spillage.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.550
So, what do you think now?

41:32.600 --> 41:35.190
~ Of the Doctor? ~ Yeah.

41:35.240 --> 41:38.040
See, he's all right, isn't he,
really? Underneath it all.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.320
OK.
Tell me what you're thinking.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.960
I know men like him.
I've served under them.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.510
They push you
and make you stronger,

41:58.560 --> 42:01.670
till you're doing things
you never thought you could.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.910
I saw you tonight,
you did exactly what he told you.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.400
You weren't even scared.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.320
And you should have been.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.880
I trust him.
He has never let me down.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.680
Fine.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.710
If he ever pushes you too far,
then I want you to tell me,

42:26.760 --> 42:29.070
because I know what that's like.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.150
You'll tell me
if that happens, yeah?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.990
Yeah, it's a deal.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.840
~ No. It's a promise.
~ OK. I promise.

42:37.360 --> 42:40.910
~ If you break that promise, Clara,
we're finished. ~ Don't say that.

42:40.960 --> 42:44.910
I am saying it because if you
if you don't tell me the truth,

42:44.960 --> 42:49.990
I can't help you, and I could never
stand not being able to help you.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.120
Are we clear?

42:52.520 --> 42:55.040
Yes. We're clear.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.230
It was mad, it was like in a film
or on the telly,

43:12.280 --> 43:14.950
like with science fiction guns.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.790
Skovox Blitzer, sounds like.
We've had a few in from that.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.560
~ Wouldn't feel too bad.
~ If I hadn't...

43:21.920 --> 43:23.440
If I hadn't...

43:25.040 --> 43:29.110
Hang on.
That doesn't make sense.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.430
Makes perfect sense to me.

43:31.480 --> 43:36.190
How did I escape?
I don't remember how I got away.

43:36.240 --> 43:40.800
Well, I was coming to that. I'm
afraid you really rather didn't.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.950
Then how did I get here?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.270
Well...big question.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.350
Where am I?

43:52.400 --> 43:55.150
What name would you like?
There's a range. The afterlife.

43:55.200 --> 43:58.000
The Promised Land.
I'm partial to the Nethersphere.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.320
My God!

44:12.720 --> 44:15.560
Sorry, she's a bit busy today.

44:16.800 --> 44:19.000
So...any questions?

44:22.560 --> 44:25.270
Hello, Earth.
We have a terrible decision to make.

44:25.320 --> 44:28.510
An innocent life versus
the future of all mankind.

44:28.560 --> 44:32.710
Whatever future humanity might have
depends on the choice made

44:32.760 --> 44:34.190
right here, right now.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.800
Aaaarrgghh!

44:39.120 --> 44:40.520
Decision made.

44:41.305 --> 44:47.271
