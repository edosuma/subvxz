WEBVTT

00:16.448 --> 00:18.689
I've got woman,
a victim of a hit-and-run.

00:18.758 --> 00:22.586
Struck by a car in a
residential area. Unconscious.

00:22.655 --> 00:23.827
Blood pressure dropping.

00:23.931 --> 00:25.310
Possible femur fracture.

00:25.344 --> 00:27.517
Belly's distended,
possible internal bleeding.

00:27.586 --> 00:29.793
See if she was too quiet.
I'll blame you.

00:29.862 --> 00:31.827
-Take it easy.
-Is she responding to anything?

00:31.862 --> 00:34.000
-No response.
-Last blood pressure reading?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.689
Joey took her last pressure
reading in the rig, 72 over 30.

00:36.793 --> 00:38.689
Okay we're probably going
to have to intubate.

00:38.793 --> 00:40.827
I'll grab the airway kit and
have someone call respiratory.

00:40.931 --> 00:43.068
Right away.

00:43.137 --> 00:46.827
Elisha! Baby, baby, baby.
No, no, no!

00:46.896 --> 00:48.103
Elisha!

00:48.172 --> 00:49.482
Baby, baby, baby, no, no, no!

00:49.517 --> 00:51.896
-No, no, no!
-I need another doctor now!

00:51.965 --> 00:54.068
Elisha!

01:02.965 --> 01:05.965
Gimme two.

01:08.620 --> 01:09.827
Just one for me.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.206
All in, Thomas.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.724
I'm really regretting we didn't
play strip poker instead.

01:31.137 --> 01:32.724
I'll call.

01:36.758 --> 01:39.310
Then you'd be leaving
butt ass naked.

01:42.551 --> 01:44.931
God!

01:45.034 --> 01:48.551
Gotta get to work.
Dead bodies wait for no woman.

01:48.586 --> 01:51.655
Okay, Jordan, at least tell me
why you won't go out with me.

01:53.413 --> 01:57.379
Thomas, you're a forensics
profiler at Quantico.

01:57.413 --> 01:59.034
You haven't figured that out
by now?

01:59.068 --> 02:01.931
I can't believe that
you were the keynote speaker

02:02.000 --> 02:04.758
for the Forensic Pathologists
Conference yesterday

02:04.827 --> 02:07.724
and then proceeded to wipe us
all out in marathon rounds

02:07.793 --> 02:09.620
of five card draw.

02:09.655 --> 02:12.137
You're unbelievable,
you know that.

02:12.241 --> 02:13.482
Who better to fleece
than a conference

02:13.551 --> 02:15.068
full of arrogant doctors
and data nerds

02:15.137 --> 02:18.137
who tried to grab the keynote
speaker's ass all week?

02:18.206 --> 02:20.000
TouchÃ©, Dr. Touissant,

02:20.103 --> 02:24.482
but at least in my defense,
it is a very cute ass.

02:24.586 --> 02:26.965
I'm just wondering when I'm
gonna get you back in my bed?

02:27.034 --> 02:28.482
Thomas...

02:28.586 --> 02:33.310
you have a special set of skills
that I'm quite fond of.

02:33.379 --> 02:38.206
And we had fun for a couple of
months. But that's all it was.

02:39.482 --> 02:41.206
Just give us a chance.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.724
We agreed that we're better off
as cordial colleagues

02:45.793 --> 02:48.379
and rival poker players.

02:49.655 --> 02:53.827
Although, you're not really
a rival anymore.

02:53.931 --> 02:56.620
After last night,
you're more like a mark.

02:56.689 --> 02:59.931
Oh, damn!

02:59.965 --> 03:02.172
That's vicious, you're vicious.

03:02.206 --> 03:03.862
I gotta take this.

03:03.931 --> 03:07.000
Okay. When I finished,
all right?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.931
Hello, it's Dr. Touissant.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.689
Jordan, it's Tamera.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.551
Tamera?

03:16.655 --> 03:18.517
Jordan, you need to come home.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.758
-It's Elisha...
-What?

03:21.827 --> 03:23.241
She's dead.

03:24.931 --> 03:26.344
What?

03:54.862 --> 03:57.344
This is so surreal.

03:57.379 --> 03:59.241
I-I can't believe she's gone.

04:02.103 --> 04:03.551
Did you catch the driver?

04:03.620 --> 04:06.758
Um, sorry, Doc, I don't have
any updates just yet.

04:06.793 --> 04:08.448
Mrs. Harrington
and Dr. Harrington,

04:08.551 --> 04:10.758
I just wanted to come by

04:10.793 --> 04:13.413
and extend my sincere
condolences on behalf of myself

04:13.448 --> 04:15.275
and the entire New Orleans
Police Department.

04:15.379 --> 04:17.931
Thank you, Chief Lewellyn.

04:17.965 --> 04:21.724
Miles, baby, would you
excuse us for a moment?

04:21.758 --> 04:23.931
-Okay.
-I love you, baby.

04:33.551 --> 04:35.931
Police chief at a repast?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.344
What do you think
that was about?

04:37.413 --> 04:38.862
Oh, it's been a week.

04:38.931 --> 04:41.034
The police still haven't caught
the hit-and-run driver

04:41.103 --> 04:42.931
that killed Elisha.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.655
And I so imagine

04:44.724 --> 04:46.931
Mrs. Brenda Grace Harrington...

04:47.000 --> 04:49.448
she is putting her
Louboutin firmly

04:49.551 --> 04:51.551
in the chief's
grits-and-gravy ass.

04:51.586 --> 04:53.413
Do they have any leads?

04:53.448 --> 04:56.103
It's like Elisha
was hit by a ghost.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.862
Who found her?

04:57.931 --> 05:00.241
A neighbor,
out walking his dog,

05:00.275 --> 05:02.724
found her on the side
of the road.

05:04.586 --> 05:06.482
Where was Miles?

05:06.586 --> 05:08.068
At the hospital.

05:09.448 --> 05:11.379
Isn't he the
emergency room chief?

05:12.413 --> 05:14.517
Why was he there that late?

05:14.620 --> 05:17.000
I don't know, Earl called
for an ambulance

05:17.068 --> 05:19.172
as soon as he found her.

05:19.206 --> 05:22.137
Girl, with this zip code, they
came in a matter of minutes.

05:23.862 --> 05:26.655
But by the time they got her
to the hospital, they just...

05:27.793 --> 05:29.827
couldn't do nothing for her.

05:35.344 --> 05:36.827
I thought you quit?

05:37.965 --> 05:39.931
Haven't touched one
since Bill died.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.517
I thought you quit?

05:50.620 --> 05:52.689
My liver quit a long time ago.

05:52.758 --> 05:55.172
That's why I only drink
on Tuesdays and Thursdays

05:55.241 --> 05:56.827
and when the Saints lose.

05:58.517 --> 06:00.689
He's a good man,
Bill Harrington.

06:00.724 --> 06:02.482
Made a damn fine whiskey.

06:03.379 --> 06:04.724
Yes.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.965
Yes, he did.

06:07.034 --> 06:10.241
But unlike my
family's bourbon...

06:10.344 --> 06:11.827
Bill was weak.

06:12.965 --> 06:14.724
Didn't have the balls
to do the things

06:14.758 --> 06:17.551
that needed to be done
to protect his family.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.724
Well, lucky for me...

06:25.068 --> 06:28.965
I got balls bigger
than the state of Louisiana.

06:29.034 --> 06:31.827
That you do, Mrs. Harrington.
That you do.

06:36.206 --> 06:37.793
Now, Chief...

06:40.241 --> 06:41.793
how big are your balls?

06:41.862 --> 06:44.068
Whoa, Brenda Grace!
What the hell...

06:48.241 --> 06:49.724
Tell me, Chief.

06:51.034 --> 06:52.793
What's going on
with the investigation

06:52.862 --> 06:54.758
into my daughter-in-law's death?

06:54.827 --> 06:57.379
I told you, we're working
around the clock...

06:57.413 --> 07:00.620
and we won't rest until
the driver of that car is found.

07:05.931 --> 07:08.137
If you want to stay chief,

07:08.241 --> 07:13.758
you'll see to it that your
good ol' boys do their jobs.

07:13.793 --> 07:16.137
You will not be
city's dog catcher

07:16.206 --> 07:19.793
if my poor son doesn't
get justice very soon

07:19.827 --> 07:23.965
for his beloved wife.
God rest her soul.

07:35.551 --> 07:38.103
Yes, ma'am.

07:38.137 --> 07:40.413
-I'm gonna need that dress.
-Say less, sis.

07:40.448 --> 07:41.758
That's yours.

07:41.793 --> 07:43.448
Matter of fact, I was making

07:43.482 --> 07:44.965
Elisha and Brenda Grace's gowns

07:45.034 --> 07:47.620
for the Grand Boule gala
this year.

07:47.655 --> 07:50.793
Yes, come through New Orleans
haute couture

07:50.896 --> 07:53.034
for the grand dame
of the Grand Boule.

07:54.310 --> 07:56.482
Your girl went from the bottom
to the Boule

07:56.551 --> 07:58.620
just in time for my birthday.

08:00.137 --> 08:03.103
Although it won't
be a happy one this year.

08:03.172 --> 08:04.586
That's right.

08:04.655 --> 08:07.310
It is almost your birthday.

08:07.379 --> 08:11.586
Well... we're gonna
celebrate any way.

08:12.862 --> 08:15.000
It's what Elisha
would've wanted.

08:15.034 --> 08:16.689
Yeah, I guess you're right.

08:16.724 --> 08:20.310
I feel like I owe you and Elisha
an apology.

08:20.379 --> 08:22.862
Why would you need
to apologize to us?

08:26.379 --> 08:30.137
When my mom lost her
battle at cancer...

08:30.206 --> 08:34.379
I was drowning in grief.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.000
And when that job offer from DC

08:36.034 --> 08:39.034
to be the City's
Medical Examiner came in,

08:39.103 --> 08:40.862
I...

08:40.896 --> 08:43.310
I grabbed on to it
like it was a life preserver

08:43.379 --> 08:45.310
I just threw myself into work.

08:47.103 --> 08:49.103
I mean, I kept up with you
on social media.

08:49.172 --> 08:52.379
I saw you killing
at fashion game,

08:52.448 --> 08:56.689
and Elisha was... running her
family's foundation.

08:58.034 --> 09:00.724
She finally had
the family that...

09:00.793 --> 09:03.344
The perfect family
she always wanted.

09:04.827 --> 09:07.620
Elisha just missed you,
you know.

09:07.724 --> 09:10.000
-We both did.
-She called me.

09:11.344 --> 09:14.724
And, uh, I saw that
she called, but...

09:14.758 --> 09:16.241
I didn't call her back.

09:17.689 --> 09:19.206
What did she say?

09:19.275 --> 09:21.586
I listened to the message
on the plane on the way here

09:21.689 --> 09:23.793
and...

09:23.896 --> 09:26.137
she sounded like she was worried
about something.

09:27.379 --> 09:29.275
Oh, you can't.

09:29.344 --> 09:32.068
You can't worry about
that now, I mean...

09:32.103 --> 09:34.379
Maybe she was stressed
about the Boule.

09:34.448 --> 09:37.724
Brenda Grace want to make it
bigger and better every year.

09:37.758 --> 09:40.103
Kick off of the season.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.551
That would stress anybody out,
huh, girl?

09:43.379 --> 09:46.068
It didn't seem like
it was about work.

09:50.068 --> 09:53.137
Hey, Jordan, it-it's Elisha.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.172
Wow, I feel like I haven't
talked to you in forever.

09:57.241 --> 10:00.448
Can you call me back
when you get this message?

10:00.517 --> 10:02.379
I need some advice.

10:02.448 --> 10:05.448
You're the only one
I can trust right now.

10:05.551 --> 10:07.241
Please, call me back.

10:08.379 --> 10:09.758
See?

10:10.862 --> 10:12.379
Doesn't it seem like
she was worried

10:12.448 --> 10:14.068
about something serious?

10:16.931 --> 10:19.275
-I don't--
-Tamera.

10:19.379 --> 10:22.241
Mother would like to speak
with you about the Grand Boule.

10:24.241 --> 10:25.758
Sure, Miles.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.000
Love you.

10:50.241 --> 10:51.758
That Harrington bitch
is on my ass

10:51.862 --> 10:53.344
like a gator in chicken coop.

10:53.413 --> 10:55.241
So that means I'm on yours.

10:55.310 --> 10:57.448
Here.

10:57.517 --> 11:00.758
Spread that around and find the
driver of that car, you hear?

11:14.482 --> 11:16.000
Coming!

11:22.413 --> 11:25.965
Oh, my God! I totally forgot
you're coming today.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.172
Um...

11:28.206 --> 11:33.000
You know, I haven't decided what
I'm gonna keep for staging.

11:33.068 --> 11:36.137
But, you know, you guys
can just come on in.

11:44.344 --> 11:46.655
You know what, why don't
you guys start upstairs

11:46.689 --> 11:47.827
and I'll just meet you
in a second?

11:50.862 --> 11:52.620
Hey, morning, beautiful.
Just checking on you.

11:52.655 --> 11:54.241
How was the service?

11:55.586 --> 11:58.448
Elisha's homegoing was lovely.

11:58.517 --> 12:02.586
But they still haven't caught
the driver that killed Elisha.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.517
What are the police saying?

12:04.551 --> 12:05.724
Not enough.

12:05.827 --> 12:07.482
Can you hold on a second?

12:10.137 --> 12:12.586
My officers are pursuing
several leads.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.413
The New Orleans police
department will not rest

12:14.517 --> 12:17.275
until this callous killer
is brought to justice.

12:19.896 --> 12:21.413
Look, I'm sorry to bother you
so early,

12:21.517 --> 12:23.724
but I need to confirm if you're
coming to Quantico on Monday.

12:23.758 --> 12:25.551
You're supposed to be giving
your Racial Bias

12:25.586 --> 12:27.793
in Forensic Pathology
and Criminal Testimony talk

12:27.862 --> 12:29.517
to the new class of agents.

12:29.586 --> 12:33.379
And they're excited to meet
DC's chief medical examiner.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.862
-Monday?
-Yeah.

12:34.896 --> 12:36.068
You're still planning
on coming back

12:36.137 --> 12:37.793
at the end of the week, right?

12:39.206 --> 12:42.379
Yes. I, um, I just forgot.

12:42.413 --> 12:45.793
Hey, it's okay. I know you got a
lot on your mind right now.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.310
Yeah.

12:47.379 --> 12:50.689
In addition to processing
Elisha's death,

12:50.758 --> 12:55.344
I am trying to deal with my
parent's town home.

12:55.413 --> 12:57.413
The people that I hired
to get it ready

12:57.482 --> 12:58.551
are actually here.

12:58.655 --> 13:00.103
Right now.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.482
Jordan, will you please let me
know if you need any help?

13:03.586 --> 13:05.310
You need not have to do this
all on your own.

13:05.379 --> 13:08.137
I can be there
in a New Orleans minute.

13:08.206 --> 13:10.034
Yeah, thank you.
I appreciate you.

13:10.103 --> 13:11.586
No problem, precious.

13:12.758 --> 13:13.965
I'm sorry about that.

13:14.034 --> 13:16.517
Um, where should we start?

13:21.379 --> 13:25.448
-I don't know what to say.
-Just say, "Yes."

13:25.482 --> 13:29.206
It would mean so much to me
and, frankly, Miles.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.448
And I think that's what your
dear mother would want also.

13:34.034 --> 13:37.206
How I so miss
Claire's friendship.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.379
It's just that I was scheduled
to leave on Friday.

13:39.448 --> 13:42.965
Well, surely you can extend
your stay in New Orleans,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.793
for your mother's dearest
and oldest friend.

13:45.827 --> 13:50.103
And besides, Jordan,
it's for Elisha.

13:53.379 --> 13:55.137
Of course I can extend
my stay.

13:55.206 --> 13:56.965
I-I would be honored.

13:58.241 --> 14:00.275
Oh, bless your heart, Jordan.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.241
But this calls for a toast.

14:03.379 --> 14:06.275
Cheers to the Grand Boule.

14:07.758 --> 14:09.344
To the Boule.

14:20.310 --> 14:22.172
Oh, well, looky here!

14:23.896 --> 14:27.517
If it isn't Jordan Touissant,
as I live and breathe.

14:27.586 --> 14:29.034
Oh!

14:29.137 --> 14:30.344
Sully, you know
I couldn't come home

14:30.379 --> 14:32.275
without stopping by this office.

14:32.344 --> 14:35.448
And is that box of beignets
a gift for your old boss?

14:35.517 --> 14:38.137
Mm-hm, only the
best from Filene's

14:38.206 --> 14:40.448
for the man that gave
this college student

14:40.517 --> 14:44.551
the internship of a lifetime,
and a job after graduation.

14:44.655 --> 14:47.862
Well, you remember, you wouldn't
stop hanging around.

14:47.931 --> 14:49.344
I had to give you a job

14:49.379 --> 14:51.379
to stop Esther from thinking
I was having an affair.

14:51.482 --> 14:54.034
Please give Esther my best

14:54.137 --> 14:55.862
and tell her
I still miss her jambalaya.

14:55.965 --> 14:58.758
I certainly will do that.

14:58.827 --> 15:01.620
So, how's DC treating you?

15:01.689 --> 15:06.241
It's good, you know, busy.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.758
I hear a "but" in your voice.

15:09.793 --> 15:12.724
Is the beltway not all that you
thought it would be?

15:14.103 --> 15:16.551
Uh, it's not that...

15:16.620 --> 15:18.758
But I guess
it's just not New Orleans.

15:18.827 --> 15:20.517
Doesn't feel like home yet.

15:20.586 --> 15:24.620
Well, after 30 years
with Esther,

15:24.689 --> 15:28.758
I can tell you from experience
until you find someone special

15:28.862 --> 15:30.413
it never will be.

15:30.448 --> 15:33.896
And what makes you think
I haven't found someone special?

15:33.931 --> 15:36.724
There's no ring on that finger.

15:36.793 --> 15:40.275
You know, in addition
to my career in DC,

15:40.379 --> 15:41.793
I have you to thank

15:41.862 --> 15:44.758
for my repertoire of forensic
pathologist jokes.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.620
I kill at conferences.

15:46.689 --> 15:49.896
Do you know why the best
forensic teams can never catch

15:49.931 --> 15:51.482
hillbilly criminals?

15:51.551 --> 15:52.551
Why, Sully?

15:52.620 --> 15:54.275
'Cause they all share
the same DNA

15:54.344 --> 15:57.241
and there ain't no
doggone dental records.

15:59.586 --> 16:03.310
Don't quit your day job
for a, you know, open-mic night.

16:03.344 --> 16:06.310
I cannot wait
to have these after lunch.

16:06.344 --> 16:08.172
I brought you some napkins too.

16:08.241 --> 16:10.241
Oh, thank you so much now.

16:14.448 --> 16:15.965
Is that Elisha's autopsy?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.965
Don't.. I-I'm sorry. That..

16:19.000 --> 16:21.793
That...
Sorry, it shouldn't be out.

16:21.827 --> 16:23.482
Can I see it?

16:23.517 --> 16:25.379
Are you sure you want to do
that to yourself?

16:26.655 --> 16:29.000
I know how close
the two of you were.

16:29.103 --> 16:30.724
This just breaks my heart.

16:32.413 --> 16:37.344
I'll always regret not seeing
her one last time.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.482
Excuse me, one second.

16:40.965 --> 16:43.000
Sully Dufresne.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.482
Yes.

16:45.965 --> 16:47.379
Already?

16:49.344 --> 16:51.551
All right.
Okay, I'll be right out.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.689
-Got a body?
-Yes.

16:56.793 --> 17:01.034
And the lift gate's acting up,
so I gotta go out and open it.

17:01.068 --> 17:02.724
Don't you touch my beignets.

17:02.793 --> 17:04.379
Uh, never.

17:14.137 --> 17:15.655
Oh, my God!

17:50.482 --> 17:52.724
You want my arm to fall off?

17:52.793 --> 17:54.379
What are you doing here?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.551
You didn't answer my question.

17:58.586 --> 18:00.896
"Do you want my arm
to fall off?"

18:00.965 --> 18:02.551
You're no Billie Dee Williams.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.482
Well, you ain't no Diana Ross

18:04.586 --> 18:07.275
from what I can remember after
some of our karaoke nights,

18:07.310 --> 18:09.793
but I won't hold
that against you.

18:13.103 --> 18:15.275
But you're still...

18:17.448 --> 18:19.310
just as beautiful.

18:19.379 --> 18:21.379
-Marcus?
-Mm-hm?

18:21.448 --> 18:23.103
What are you doing here?

18:23.137 --> 18:24.448
I saw you watching us
at the funeral.

18:24.551 --> 18:25.965
Are you stalking me now?

18:28.827 --> 18:31.758
Wow! Someone has developed a
mighty high opinion

18:31.827 --> 18:34.655
of themselves
after breaking up with me

18:34.724 --> 18:37.965
and moving all the way to DC
for their fancy new job.

18:39.137 --> 18:40.896
Hm.

18:40.965 --> 18:43.655
And I see you made detective.

18:43.724 --> 18:47.379
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

18:47.448 --> 18:49.482
Good afternoon,
Detective Bardot.

18:49.551 --> 18:52.000
-Afternoon, Dr. Dufresne.
-Oh, Sully, please.

18:52.068 --> 18:54.793
There's no room for formalities
amongst the dead.

18:57.172 --> 19:00.103
I just came to get the medical
examiner's official report

19:00.137 --> 19:02.551
on the Elisha Harrington case.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.034
You could've called,
I would've emailed them

19:04.137 --> 19:05.689
over to your office.

19:05.724 --> 19:08.379
I just want to make sure
I got everything for the chief.

19:08.448 --> 19:09.896
You know, high profile case,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.275
so we gotta make sure
we review every single detail

19:13.344 --> 19:14.620
to find that good old driver.

19:14.689 --> 19:16.620
-Okay.
-So, can I have the photos?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.379
-That would be fine?
-Oh, um...

19:18.482 --> 19:20.344
Well, these aren't those photos.

19:20.379 --> 19:23.517
They, um, got mixed up
in this other file.

19:23.551 --> 19:25.689
Organizational skills
have lapsed

19:25.724 --> 19:29.448
ever since Delilah went out
on maternity leave.

19:29.517 --> 19:31.620
You'd think five kids
was enough.

19:31.689 --> 19:34.862
You know, I had to go to HR
after I said to her,

19:34.965 --> 19:37.586
"Five kid's not a family,
it's litter."

19:41.689 --> 19:44.034
Well, you don't have another set
in the photo?

19:44.068 --> 19:47.551
If not, after your thing,
go ahead and print me some more.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.931
I can do better for you,
detective.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.344
Thank you.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.034
My, uh, lab printer
is not working.

19:54.103 --> 19:56.586
And the city won't buy me
another one, so...

19:58.655 --> 20:00.206
I had to print 'em
down the hall.

20:00.310 --> 20:02.793
All right, so,
I'll just grab 'em...

20:04.655 --> 20:07.448
and I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

20:16.068 --> 20:19.689
I'm really sorry, uh,
for what happened to Elisha.

20:21.172 --> 20:22.689
Thank you.

20:24.482 --> 20:26.448
So, how long are you in town?

20:27.896 --> 20:32.310
I was supposed to leave
on Friday, but, um...

20:32.379 --> 20:36.275
Elisha's mom asked me to stick
around for the Grand Boule.

20:36.344 --> 20:38.551
-So...
-The Grand Boule.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.896
So, does that ticket still
come with a paper bag test?

20:40.965 --> 20:43.517
You know
they don't do that anymore.

20:43.586 --> 20:44.862
Okay, you're there.

20:44.965 --> 20:47.517
-Here you go, Detective.
-Oh, thank you.

20:47.620 --> 20:48.862
Mm-hm.

20:48.896 --> 20:51.793
Marcus, do you mind giving me
a ride home?

20:53.137 --> 20:54.551
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

20:54.655 --> 20:56.517
I was hoping we gonna
continue our visit.

20:56.551 --> 20:59.137
I know, I just,
I just remembered.

20:59.206 --> 21:01.793
I have the plumber coming
to look at a leaky pipe.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.413
Well, you check in with me
before you leave, darlin'.

21:04.448 --> 21:06.586
Aw, you know I will.

21:06.655 --> 21:08.344
-All right.
-Okay.

21:08.413 --> 21:10.413
-See you, dear.
-Take care.

21:11.413 --> 21:13.379
Sully.

21:16.758 --> 21:19.241
Come on, got 'em in here. My
car's parked around the corner.

21:19.275 --> 21:21.068
Jordan, hey,
what are you doing?

21:21.103 --> 21:23.862
Stop, Jordan. Get...
Jordan.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.275
There's a photo missing.

21:27.344 --> 21:30.034
What photo, Jordan?

21:30.103 --> 21:32.379
The photo that shows
that Elisha was strangled.

21:42.448 --> 21:44.931
I don't know,
what do we have here?

21:46.344 --> 21:48.172
Oh, my God!

21:48.241 --> 21:49.827
Just stop.

21:51.448 --> 21:53.000
It was in the cushion.

21:53.068 --> 21:54.758
I fell asleep
on the couch last night.

21:54.793 --> 21:57.931
That's okay. You know I always
loved you in lingerie.

21:59.448 --> 22:02.931
My lingerie habits stopped being
your concern five years ago.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.413
Not 'cause I wanted it to.

22:16.103 --> 22:17.482
Look.

22:18.862 --> 22:20.689
We need to figure out
why Sully's hiding

22:20.793 --> 22:23.000
the photo that shows
that Elisha was strangled.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.827
Hm.

22:28.482 --> 22:31.310
Are those the pictures
that you took?

22:31.344 --> 22:32.931
-Yes.
-And the missing photo?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.931
And those photos,
and that voicemail

22:35.000 --> 22:37.482
I played for you in the car
from Elisha,

22:37.517 --> 22:40.000
has all my Spidey
senses tingling.

22:42.103 --> 22:43.827
Something's not right.

22:46.689 --> 22:50.103
Strangulation doesn't
really make sense.

22:50.172 --> 22:53.965
When the EMTs got to Elisha,
she was still alive.

22:54.034 --> 22:56.862
She didn't die until after
she got to the hospital.

22:56.931 --> 22:59.862
And Elisha was examined by
her loving husband

22:59.965 --> 23:03.206
who just happened to be working
at the hospital that night.

23:03.241 --> 23:05.689
Pretty convenient alibi, huh?

23:05.724 --> 23:07.000
So, what, are you trying to say

23:07.068 --> 23:09.068
that Dr. Miles Harrington
killed his wife?

23:09.137 --> 23:11.344
Fifty-five percent of
female homicide victims

23:11.413 --> 23:15.896
are killed by an intimate
partner, husbands or boyfriends.

23:17.172 --> 23:19.655
Isn't the husband
always the first suspect?

23:20.793 --> 23:22.896
Not when you're a Harrington.

23:22.931 --> 23:25.000
Off the rip, the Police Chief
was real adamant

23:25.068 --> 23:27.620
that we pursue
a hit-and-run driver.

23:28.896 --> 23:30.827
Miles was never even questioned.

23:30.896 --> 23:34.724
Did NOLA PD even check
his timeline for the night?

23:34.758 --> 23:36.724
According to the hospital
key card,

23:36.758 --> 23:39.068
that Miles Harrington was
conveniently at the hospital

23:39.172 --> 23:40.724
at that time that
Elisha was murdered.

23:40.793 --> 23:42.724
-The key card.
-Mm-hm.

23:42.758 --> 23:46.413
Did any person
actually see him there

23:46.482 --> 23:48.379
before his wife arrived?

23:48.413 --> 23:51.379
I'll follow up tomorrow
and I can check.

23:51.413 --> 23:55.172
But if Elisha was strangled,

23:55.241 --> 23:56.586
then how was she still alive

23:56.689 --> 23:59.448
when she got to the hospital,
Dr. Touissant?

24:01.551 --> 24:03.103
Okay, detective.

24:04.275 --> 24:06.517
Look. Give me your hands.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.206
Now...

24:11.275 --> 24:12.862
As you apply pressure,

24:12.931 --> 24:15.034
the victim will
lose consciousness.

24:15.103 --> 24:18.793
Depending on the amount of time
without oxygen,

24:18.827 --> 24:22.586
there could be permanent
medical consequences.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.689
Stroke or brain damage

24:24.758 --> 24:26.931
and obviously death.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.620
I think Elisha's attacker
was interrupted

24:29.655 --> 24:31.620
before he could finish the job.

24:33.448 --> 24:35.793
Why does it always
have to be a he?

24:35.827 --> 24:38.965
Well, without looking
at the body, I can't be sure,

24:39.034 --> 24:41.827
but judging from these photos,

24:41.896 --> 24:46.103
I would bet this townhouse
that her attacker was a man.

24:51.137 --> 24:54.000
Seems like you're enjoying your
job a little bit too much.

24:55.896 --> 24:57.034
Hardly.

24:59.965 --> 25:04.103
So... are you really going
to sell this place?

25:05.827 --> 25:08.000
It's time.

25:08.034 --> 25:11.172
-Hm.
-I'm never here anymore anyway.

25:11.206 --> 25:13.137
Yeah, I'm trying to get it
on the market

25:13.206 --> 25:14.862
before I get back to DC.

25:14.965 --> 25:18.586
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:18.655 --> 25:20.413
Why?

25:20.482 --> 25:22.896
Well, because...

25:22.965 --> 25:26.689
if you still own
this beautiful the place...

25:28.379 --> 25:31.000
there's a chance that you'd
come back to New Orleans.

25:32.758 --> 25:34.586
Back to me.

25:35.965 --> 25:38.206
âª Smiling on the surface

25:38.275 --> 25:40.034
âª Deep down are
you feeling me âª

25:40.103 --> 25:43.517
âª Baby I'm strong enough âª

25:43.586 --> 25:45.275
We shouldn't do this.

25:47.689 --> 25:49.758
Enjoying the night, eh, now?

25:51.206 --> 25:53.379
I didn't realize
how much I missed you

25:53.448 --> 25:56.068
until I saw you at the cemetery.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.862
Marcus...

26:11.586 --> 26:13.103
The past is the past.

26:13.206 --> 26:14.758
Hm.

26:16.206 --> 26:17.413
Excuse me.

26:17.482 --> 26:19.275
Let me go...

26:19.379 --> 26:22.896
before you do something
that you will regret

26:22.931 --> 26:25.827
in the morning to make up
to something.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.758
Good night, doctor.

26:47.241 --> 26:51.206
âª Baby I'm not strong enough

26:53.586 --> 26:55.275
Don't act like you
forgot something

26:55.379 --> 26:56.931
to try to get me into bed.

26:57.034 --> 26:59.000
Ugh!

27:01.482 --> 27:03.827
It's not happening.

27:08.448 --> 27:10.620
Mind if I come in?

27:10.655 --> 27:12.827
Um...

27:12.862 --> 27:14.482
I was actually
just about to go to bed.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.206
Right, so I hear.

27:18.103 --> 27:21.413
I'm guessing you were expecting
somebody else, right?

27:23.344 --> 27:27.689
What can I do for you, Miles?
It's pretty late. You okay?

27:27.758 --> 27:32.137
Yeah, yeah, um, no, I just,
I just left the hospital.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.965
You're back at work already?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.620
Yeah, yeah, you know, it's...

27:36.689 --> 27:40.241
It's the only thing that
you know quiets my brains

27:40.310 --> 27:42.724
so I'm not thinking
about Elisha all day...

27:44.413 --> 27:46.379
and catching the bastard
who killed her.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.000
How's Amaya Grace?

27:55.344 --> 27:57.448
She's still asking when her
mommy's coming home.

27:58.586 --> 28:00.137
Um...

28:02.137 --> 28:04.689
I don't think she fully
understands what happened.

28:04.724 --> 28:07.482
I'm sorry, Miles. I...

28:07.551 --> 28:08.724
I know that can't be easy.

28:08.827 --> 28:13.034
Elisha, she loved you so much.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.793
You were her best friend, right?

28:17.724 --> 28:19.206
Yeah.

28:20.724 --> 28:23.448
Miles, have you been drinking?

28:28.896 --> 28:31.758
Yeah, it's, uh...

28:31.827 --> 28:34.482
It's the only thing that gets me
through the lonely nights.

28:36.241 --> 28:38.586
Tell you the truth, I can't even
sleep in my own bed right now.

28:38.655 --> 28:42.206
You really shouldn't be driving
if you've been drinking.

28:42.241 --> 28:43.896
I just came to say thank you,
Jordan.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.379
"Thank you?"

28:45.448 --> 28:46.724
For what?

28:46.758 --> 28:50.689
Mother told me that
you two had lunch at Gris Gris

28:50.758 --> 28:55.379
and that you agreed to be
the Grand Boule queen.

28:59.413 --> 29:03.103
I, I didn't realize you guys
had opened a restaurant.

29:03.137 --> 29:06.310
Elisha and I opened a
restaurant and lounge

29:06.413 --> 29:09.137
just-just last year, you know?

29:09.241 --> 29:12.965
She... Man, she wanted something
that was just ours,

29:13.068 --> 29:15.448
wasn't tied to the family.

29:15.517 --> 29:17.310
Anything for Elisha.

29:17.379 --> 29:19.862
You know, hey, um,
I'll give you a call

29:19.931 --> 29:22.310
and we-we can talk about
the foundation

29:22.379 --> 29:25.034
'cause I know Elisha,
she was really, really proud

29:25.103 --> 29:26.862
of the Ninth Ward youth center.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.275
-So--
-Sounds good.

29:29.310 --> 29:30.931
I, I'll give you a call, Miles.

29:30.965 --> 29:33.965
-Okay?
-You call.

29:34.068 --> 29:35.620
You take care, Miles.

29:37.241 --> 29:38.758
Okay.

29:38.793 --> 29:40.379
Yeah.

29:40.448 --> 29:42.965
-Get home safe.
-Thank you.

29:43.034 --> 29:45.034
-Bye, Jordan.
-Good night.

30:11.448 --> 30:14.482
I told you exactly who I need it
to be, Dayveon? You get it done.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.965
-You're making it complicated.
-I can't afford any mistakes.

30:17.034 --> 30:18.931
I got you,
you ain't gotta worry.

30:18.965 --> 30:20.275
I'm just saying,
what you got for me?

30:20.310 --> 30:22.172
I ain't got shit for you, boy.

30:24.275 --> 30:26.275
-Hey.
-Hey, girl.

30:26.310 --> 30:28.103
I didn't know you were gonna
stop by today.

30:29.206 --> 30:31.275
-I'll call you later.
-Oh.

30:37.241 --> 30:40.586
-Um, ahem, who that, girl?
-That's nobody.

30:40.655 --> 30:44.827
Hm, he looks like he wants
to be somebody's body.

30:44.931 --> 30:46.586
You were talking about me
needing the D, he looked like

30:46.655 --> 30:48.482
he wanted to give it to you,
right there on the desk.

30:48.551 --> 30:50.758
Don't nobody got time for
these New Orleans dudes.

30:50.793 --> 30:52.103
They on some real clown shit.

30:52.137 --> 30:54.206
Like damn near wearing
a bear costume

30:54.275 --> 30:56.275
riding a unicycle and shit.

30:56.379 --> 30:57.586
No, ma'am.

30:58.862 --> 31:00.586
Ooh! What about Ashton's father?

31:00.655 --> 31:03.827
Hm, I haven't seen that fool
in over a year.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.724
See, try these guys out here
at your own risk.

31:06.793 --> 31:09.206
They should all come
with warning labels.

31:09.310 --> 31:11.379
You did always love a man
who could play a horn.

31:11.448 --> 31:13.448
What did you say in college,
if he knows how to play a horn

31:13.517 --> 31:15.448
then he knows
how to use his lips.

31:15.517 --> 31:18.034
Yeah, shocker, a jazz trumpeter
as my baby daddy

31:18.137 --> 31:21.344
isn't quite the windfall
I was promised, okay?

31:21.379 --> 31:25.689
Now, he's been ghost for most of
Ashton's life, but you know what

31:25.724 --> 31:28.344
my baby ain't never gonna go
without like I did.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.413
What's this?

31:38.793 --> 31:40.344
You're the Grand Boule queen?

31:41.517 --> 31:43.862
I thought you were going back
to DC?

31:43.965 --> 31:46.517
I was planning to, but, uh...

31:46.551 --> 31:49.655
Then I had lunch with Brenda
Grace, and she pulled the whole

31:49.724 --> 31:53.655
"Claire's my oldest
and dearest friend" card

31:53.724 --> 31:57.517
and, well, guilted me
into staying another week.

31:57.551 --> 32:00.551
So, you're taking Elisha's place
as the Boule queen?

32:00.620 --> 32:04.103
No, she just asked me to be
the honorary Boule queen

32:04.172 --> 32:05.793
and announce a grant

32:05.862 --> 32:07.896
that the Harrington Foundation
is giving to a youth center

32:07.931 --> 32:09.448
in the Ninth Ward.

32:09.517 --> 32:11.862
Apparently,
that was the last thing

32:11.931 --> 32:13.448
that Elisha was working on.

32:13.551 --> 32:17.482
Yeah, I know, I was the one that
was helping her with the plans.

32:21.655 --> 32:25.724
Oh! Ti, I had no idea.

32:25.758 --> 32:28.103
Look, I'll talk to Brenda Grace.

32:28.206 --> 32:29.620
I mean, it really should be you

32:29.724 --> 32:31.896
since you were the one
helping Elisha.

32:31.965 --> 32:34.896
Brenda Grace would burn
that distillery to the ground

32:34.965 --> 32:38.000
before she let a girl from
the bottom represent her

32:38.068 --> 32:41.103
precious family
at the Grand Boule.

32:41.172 --> 32:45.103
Hey, sis, do not let her
get you down, okay?

32:45.137 --> 32:49.103
Look, I booked us into the spa
for your birthday tomorrow.

32:49.206 --> 32:52.551
So, it'll be you plus me equals

32:52.620 --> 32:56.620
facials, massages
and bottomless mimosa brunch!

32:56.689 --> 33:00.241
Okay, that'll make me
feel little bit better.

33:00.275 --> 33:02.137
But drinks on me
tonight at Gris-Gris.

33:02.172 --> 33:04.172
-Yes.
-Yeah.

33:04.241 --> 33:05.551
Treat yourself
with a nice dress.

33:05.620 --> 33:07.034
Of course.

33:09.551 --> 33:11.172
Love you.

33:21.896 --> 33:24.137
Miles, it's Tamera.
Again.

33:25.275 --> 33:27.896
Will you please call me back?

33:27.965 --> 33:29.137
We need to talk.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.413
God, I forgot my phone.

33:35.482 --> 33:36.862
Dayveon, what you thinking?

33:36.931 --> 33:38.689
People can't keep seeing you
in here like this.

33:38.758 --> 33:40.172
What you worried about,
old girl?

33:40.275 --> 33:41.827
She don't even know me,
ya hear me?

33:41.896 --> 33:43.482
I ain't worried about Jordan.

33:43.517 --> 33:46.344
What I want to know is that you
can handle what we discussed.

33:46.413 --> 33:49.758
I got you. Ain't no problems.
Let me tell you.

33:49.827 --> 33:52.482
The Crowns running that shit.

33:52.517 --> 33:55.000
Hm, so you think you got me?

33:55.103 --> 33:57.724
Yeah, I do.

33:57.793 --> 33:59.172
You need not worry.

33:59.241 --> 34:00.862
âª Congested âª

34:07.068 --> 34:08.862
âª Congested

34:11.068 --> 34:12.551
âª Congested

34:15.172 --> 34:16.655
âª Congested

34:23.206 --> 34:24.724
âª Congested

34:31.000 --> 34:32.620
âª Congested

34:39.931 --> 34:41.965
Thanks for the photo.
The plates match.

34:42.034 --> 34:43.482
Get that son of a bitch.

34:52.379 --> 34:54.241
Okay, all right,
well, cheers to that.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.896
You two got us
out of more trouble

34:56.000 --> 34:57.724
than the number of drunks

34:57.758 --> 35:00.689
showing their asses on
a "COPS" marathon.

35:00.758 --> 35:02.758
I just know that
when I first met ya

35:02.827 --> 35:05.758
y'all you were two stuck up
New Orleans princesses.

35:05.827 --> 35:07.793
Y'all had never been through
half that stuff

35:07.896 --> 35:09.275
I went through as a kid.

35:09.310 --> 35:11.448
I get it, but we knew

35:11.482 --> 35:12.931
you didn't like talking
about your childhood

35:13.000 --> 35:15.448
and you never wanted us
to meet your aunt or uncle

35:15.551 --> 35:16.965
and we respected that.

35:17.034 --> 35:20.448
Nevertheless, we ended up
ride-or-die besties.

35:22.551 --> 35:25.310
Well, I just thank y'all two
for always having my back.

35:25.379 --> 35:27.965
-You know?
-Of course.

35:28.068 --> 35:29.724
I appreciate them.

35:29.793 --> 35:31.896
And silver spoon or not,

35:31.965 --> 35:34.793
Elisha, she was a real one.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.517
-To Elisha.
-To Elisha.

35:41.034 --> 35:43.344
Yeah? This place is so quiet.

35:44.931 --> 35:47.551
Hm! Don't look now.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.103
-What?
-Don't look. Damn it, girl!

35:49.137 --> 35:51.344
I said, "Don't." Damn.

35:54.275 --> 35:56.620
Who this woman, Harpo?

35:56.655 --> 35:59.793
That's his new boo,
Simone Russell.

35:59.862 --> 36:02.172
She in real estate.

36:02.206 --> 36:05.551
Them two've been hot and heavy
for about six months.

36:05.655 --> 36:09.379
Well, before your fat ass
sashayed into town.

36:09.482 --> 36:11.620
Well, a switching
you like to do.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.379
Who is that?

36:24.448 --> 36:27.344
Um, that is...
Jordan Touissant.

36:27.379 --> 36:29.517
-She's--
-Girl, seeing you.

36:29.551 --> 36:30.862
Well played, my friend.

36:30.965 --> 36:34.172
Girl. Ain't nobody thinking
about Marcus.

36:34.206 --> 36:36.206
Oooh, girl, come on!

36:36.275 --> 36:37.793
Hm-hm.

37:25.275 --> 37:27.137
Amaya Grace...

37:27.206 --> 37:34.275
This crown... has been in our
family for five generations.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.758
Come on, baby.

37:38.034 --> 37:42.413
And one day, you'll wear it
at the Grand Boule.

37:42.448 --> 37:45.413
Did, did my mommy wear it too?

37:46.965 --> 37:50.482
-Baby, she was supposed to--
-Hey, baby girl! Ah!

37:54.103 --> 37:55.413
-Hey!
-Look at this.

37:55.517 --> 37:56.931
This was mommy's.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.275
Oh, this is pretty.

37:58.379 --> 38:00.655
Did your grandmother
give this to you?

38:02.896 --> 38:04.172
Huh.

38:04.241 --> 38:08.103
Hey, why don't you go upstairs
and get ready for bed

38:08.172 --> 38:11.689
and I'll be up in a minute
to tuck you in?

38:11.758 --> 38:14.137
I just want to talk to your
grandmother for a moment.

38:14.172 --> 38:17.413
-Okay, love you, daddy.
-Love you too. Hey!

38:17.482 --> 38:19.827
-Good night.
-Good night, baby.

38:29.448 --> 38:32.655
You wanna tell me why you were
talking to my daughter

38:32.724 --> 38:34.517
about the Grand Boule?

38:34.620 --> 38:37.551
She needs to know her
family history.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.103
It's tradition, Miles.

38:39.172 --> 38:40.827
Mother, you are unbelievable,
you know that?

38:40.862 --> 38:43.724
-I'm unbelievable?
-Yeah, unbelievable.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.103
Elisha hasn't even been
gone a month,

38:47.172 --> 38:49.655
yet and here you...

38:52.000 --> 38:55.413
You know what, I don't
think we should participate

38:55.482 --> 38:57.103
in the Boule this year.

38:58.965 --> 39:01.172
Miles...

39:01.241 --> 39:03.275
Honey, I know you're grieving.

39:03.344 --> 39:05.068
Yes.

39:05.137 --> 39:08.000
We're all are, love.

39:08.068 --> 39:11.551
But the Grand Boule
was started by our ancestors

39:11.586 --> 39:13.758
who purchased their freedom

39:13.827 --> 39:16.413
and built the
bourbon distillery.

39:16.517 --> 39:19.379
-The Harrington brand.
-Yeah.

39:19.413 --> 39:22.172
That started
our family's fortune.

39:22.241 --> 39:25.965
That in which
will always be honored...

39:26.034 --> 39:27.482
by our family.

39:27.551 --> 39:29.068
Yeah, the Harrington brand

39:29.172 --> 39:31.482
you know, I heard this story
a thousand times, Mother.

39:31.551 --> 39:33.000
And I understand it, okay?

39:33.068 --> 39:35.206
But Elisha, she meant...

39:36.827 --> 39:39.379
You know what... I can't do this
with you right now.

39:39.413 --> 39:41.448
-Miles...
-This is...

39:42.827 --> 39:47.241
Yes, Chief Lewellyn, what is it?

39:47.310 --> 39:49.206
Sorry to call
so late, Mrs. Harrington,

39:49.275 --> 39:51.758
but I'd thought you'd want to
hear the news right away.

39:51.862 --> 39:55.517
Yes, yes, please.
Go, go right ahead, Chief.

39:55.586 --> 39:58.379
We found the driver
of the car that killed Elisha.

39:58.482 --> 40:00.206
Thank you, God.

40:05.896 --> 40:07.896
Our officers pursued the suspect
and had him trapped.

40:07.965 --> 40:09.413
Once he saw there was no way out

40:09.517 --> 40:11.517
he drove his truck
into the river.

40:11.586 --> 40:14.068
Ernie Reynolds is the prime
suspect in the fatal hit-and-run

40:14.137 --> 40:15.551
of Elisha Harrington.

40:15.586 --> 40:17.655
We're confident that
once our forensics team

40:17.724 --> 40:19.896
gets a hold of his truck,
we will find evidence

40:20.000 --> 40:21.379
that'll match the crime scene.

40:21.448 --> 40:22.724
Thank you.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.724
-Chief...
-Uh-huh?

40:35.137 --> 40:39.241
Uh, are you sure
that this is the driver

40:39.344 --> 40:41.172
that killed Elisha Harrington?

40:41.241 --> 40:44.758
Ernie Reynolds had more DUIs
than the law allows.

40:44.827 --> 40:47.310
Once our officers tried
to pull him over, he took off.

40:47.379 --> 40:49.896
-Cigar?
-Uh, no, thank you.

40:49.965 --> 40:52.689
Only guilty people
run from cops.

40:52.724 --> 40:55.137
Hm. That's right, they do.

40:59.068 --> 41:02.689
-It's a good day.
-Yes, it is.

41:15.413 --> 41:16.827
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:16.896 --> 41:19.793
Are you by any chance
watching the news?

41:19.896 --> 41:21.310
Yep.

41:21.413 --> 41:22.586
Hm-hm, so it's done.

41:22.620 --> 41:24.241
I call bullshit.

41:24.310 --> 41:28.206
Someone's trying to cover up the
fact that Elisha was murdered.

41:28.275 --> 41:29.448
Exactly.

41:37.379 --> 41:39.137
Thank you.

41:39.206 --> 41:43.448
Cheers to that massage and
facial. That was everything.

41:43.482 --> 41:45.413
Uh, cheers to the birthday girl.

41:45.482 --> 41:50.310
One time for the birthday B,
two times for the birthday B.

41:50.413 --> 41:54.448
This was just the birthday
present I needed, thank you.

41:54.482 --> 41:56.482
I'm just so glad you enjoyed it.

41:56.586 --> 41:57.931
It's the least I can do
since you agreed

41:57.965 --> 41:59.965
to make my Grand Boule gown.

42:00.068 --> 42:02.000
It's what Elisha
would have wanted.

42:03.310 --> 42:05.034
I'm just thankful
that they finally

42:05.103 --> 42:06.482
found the guy that killed her.

42:06.551 --> 42:08.517
Do you really think
they found the right guy?

42:08.586 --> 42:10.689
Why? Don't you?

42:13.379 --> 42:16.000
I just can't stop thinking
about Elisha's last voicemail.

42:17.689 --> 42:19.793
I just wonder what she wanted.

42:56.620 --> 42:58.241
Where's Sully?

43:04.206 --> 43:05.655
Oh, God!

43:10.689 --> 43:13.655
-Hey, girl.
-Hey, girl.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.344
Yo, what's going on over there?

43:15.413 --> 43:17.758
Uh!

43:17.862 --> 43:19.896
I caught myself trying to cook.

43:19.931 --> 43:21.448
And who thought that was
a good idea?

43:21.517 --> 43:23.379
Ha, ha! Very funny.

43:23.448 --> 43:25.103
Marcus is on his way over here,
so I thought

43:25.172 --> 43:27.413
I'd at least attempt dinner.

43:27.448 --> 43:29.793
Hm! What's he coming over for?

43:29.896 --> 43:32.172
You're not still thinking
about Ernie Reynolds.

43:32.241 --> 43:35.034
Ooh! Are you stealing
Simone's man?

43:35.103 --> 43:38.862
Ugh, girl! Ain't nobody trying
to resuscitate a relationship.

43:38.931 --> 43:41.275
I'm the one who broke up
with Marcus, remember?

43:41.344 --> 43:44.206
Girl, there was no lingering
feelings since I moved to DC

43:44.275 --> 43:45.965
for my dream job.

43:46.068 --> 43:48.241
Look, I just don't want you
to get hurt again, okay?

43:48.275 --> 43:50.586
Oh, girl, he's here I gotta go.

43:50.689 --> 43:52.344
-Come in.
-Bye.

43:56.586 --> 43:58.241
Oh!

44:00.482 --> 44:02.000
Wow!

44:04.413 --> 44:05.827
Something burning?

44:05.896 --> 44:09.068
Nothing by my pride.

44:09.137 --> 44:10.827
Now don't tell me
Miss Jordan Touissant

44:10.931 --> 44:14.000
tried to go ahead and cook.

44:14.103 --> 44:15.965
-"Chef Boyar-Don't?"
-Uh-huh.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.655
-Hm-huh.
-Yeah.

44:17.724 --> 44:19.517
Well...

44:19.620 --> 44:23.000
Look at you, making detective.

44:24.551 --> 44:26.517
-It's big.
-It is.

44:26.586 --> 44:29.655
I know, thank you, thank you,
thank you.

44:29.689 --> 44:33.172
Speaking of, um... Detective...

44:33.206 --> 44:36.862
Can you help me detect why a man
police say ran off a bridge

44:36.965 --> 44:41.448
to escape arrest,
didn't die from drowning?

44:41.517 --> 44:44.965
So, you read Ernie Reynold's
autopsy report?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.827
Hm-hm, when I stopped by
to see Sully

44:47.896 --> 44:49.862
there was a Dr. Zhang there.

44:49.965 --> 44:52.241
Apparently, she's from
the Baton Rouge office

44:52.310 --> 44:55.000
and she was stepping in
to do double duty

44:55.103 --> 44:58.344
because Sully was
on an "extended vacation"

44:58.413 --> 45:01.137
with no return date.

45:01.206 --> 45:02.310
So?

45:03.551 --> 45:05.482
How did you get the report?

45:05.551 --> 45:06.896
-Hm!
-Hm!

45:06.965 --> 45:08.689
-Right.
-Hm-hm.

45:08.724 --> 45:11.379
I maybe told her that...

45:11.413 --> 45:14.034
I sometimes help Sully
out with cases

45:14.068 --> 45:18.413
and I just asked her
for Ernie Reynold's autopsy.

45:18.482 --> 45:21.379
And she seemed so overwhelmed
between two offices

45:21.448 --> 45:22.965
that, um, yeah.

45:23.034 --> 45:25.517
She was almost happy
to give it to me.

45:25.586 --> 45:28.344
Gave it to someone that she
thought was there to help.

45:28.413 --> 45:30.724
Tell me why do you think
Ernie Reynolds was dead

45:30.758 --> 45:33.034
before his truck
went into the water.

45:33.068 --> 45:35.517
Well, as you can see here...

45:35.551 --> 45:37.034
Hm-hm.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.310
There was no water in his lungs.

45:38.379 --> 45:39.758
Hm.

45:39.862 --> 45:44.862
That means he was dead before
his body ever hit the water.

45:44.896 --> 45:47.241
Hm-hm.

45:47.344 --> 45:50.034
Now, get this.

45:50.068 --> 45:51.413
This is very interesting,
'cause I did

45:51.517 --> 45:54.206
a little bit
more digging myself.

45:54.241 --> 45:56.206
The Harrington bourbon
company...

45:56.241 --> 45:58.689
It's been on the rocks
for past few years.

45:58.724 --> 46:00.689
No pun intended.

46:00.758 --> 46:05.448
But they've been laying off
a hell of a lot of workers.

46:05.551 --> 46:07.310
-Really?
-Hm-hm.

46:07.379 --> 46:09.586
They don't seem like
they're hurting.

46:09.655 --> 46:12.172
And they just opened
a restaurant last year.

46:13.551 --> 46:18.379
But if what you're
saying is true, then...

46:20.206 --> 46:22.275
where's the money coming
from for this

46:22.310 --> 46:24.448
youth center that
Elisha wanted to open?

46:25.931 --> 46:27.448
There you go.

46:47.379 --> 46:48.862
Whatchu want?

46:48.931 --> 46:51.275
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.

46:51.310 --> 46:53.931
My name is Dr. Jordan Touissant.

46:54.000 --> 46:57.034
I wanted to talk to you about
your husband, Ernie Reynolds.

46:58.310 --> 47:00.620
Police done fixed
their story on my Ernie.

47:00.689 --> 47:03.034
Well, that's why I'm here.

47:03.137 --> 47:06.344
I don't believe the story
from the police.

47:06.379 --> 47:09.379
Look, I just wanna know what
really happened to my friend.

47:09.448 --> 47:12.000
-Elisha Harrington.
-Whatchu wanna know?

47:13.620 --> 47:16.344
I can't be seen talking
to nobody 'bout this stuff.

47:17.724 --> 47:20.103
Is somebody threatening you,
Mrs. Reynolds?

47:20.172 --> 47:22.000
Because if they are,
I can get help.

47:22.034 --> 47:24.827
-The police...
-The police?

47:24.862 --> 47:26.517
Don't bring that people
round here.

47:26.586 --> 47:28.517
Mrs. Reynolds, listen...

47:28.551 --> 47:32.000
anything you say to me will
not get back to the police.

47:33.689 --> 47:35.172
You have my word.

47:37.862 --> 47:41.344
My Ernest quit drinking
six months ago.

47:41.379 --> 47:45.172
The pastor at the church was
helping him out real good.

47:45.206 --> 47:48.344
He hadn't touch
that stuff in months.

47:48.379 --> 47:50.379
Ain't no way he hit nobody.

47:50.482 --> 47:53.482
Did the police know
that he stopped drinking?

47:53.551 --> 47:58.344
I told them soon as they
dragged me down to ID his body.

47:58.379 --> 48:01.793
Ain't listen to nothin' I said.

48:01.862 --> 48:04.551
And when they dragged his car
out of the river...

48:04.620 --> 48:06.896
he wasn't able
to refute their story.

48:06.931 --> 48:08.620
And that's when
the other man came by

48:08.689 --> 48:10.344
to make sure
I ain't say nothing.

48:10.413 --> 48:11.931
Wait, what other man?

48:12.034 --> 48:14.896
Ernest got laid off
after twenty years

48:14.931 --> 48:17.413
from the Harrington Distillery.

48:17.448 --> 48:22.068
A man came by and said they'd
freeze his pension if I talked.

48:22.137 --> 48:25.275
Most of the time, nobody cared
what happened in the Ninth Ward

48:25.344 --> 48:27.275
as long as
we was just killing ourselves.

48:27.379 --> 48:29.000
We know that's changed now?

48:29.068 --> 48:30.482
Changed?

48:30.551 --> 48:31.931
Baby, this been

48:32.034 --> 48:34.551
Three Crowns gang
territory forever.

48:34.620 --> 48:37.793
Now every blocks being
overrun by redevelopment.

48:37.896 --> 48:42.103
I need that pension money
to hold on to this house.

48:42.206 --> 48:44.758
This is the only thing
I got left from my Ernest.

48:44.862 --> 48:46.482
Wait, Mrs. Reynolds, wait.

48:48.172 --> 48:50.586
Who's behind
the redevelopment?

48:50.620 --> 48:53.172
You said you Elisha Harrington's
friend, right?

48:53.241 --> 48:56.241
Then you should already know
the answer.

48:56.275 --> 48:58.931
Look, baby, don't
come 'round here no more.

48:59.034 --> 49:00.724
I don't need no more trouble.

49:34.103 --> 49:35.482
Marcus!

49:49.689 --> 49:51.793
Oh, shit. Jordan!
Jordan! Jordan!

49:51.827 --> 49:54.068
Hey, Jordan.

49:57.241 --> 49:58.758
Jordan.

50:01.413 --> 50:02.827
It's going to be okay.

50:08.724 --> 50:10.620
Easy, easy.

50:10.689 --> 50:12.517
Oh, good. You're awake.
Do you mind?

50:12.586 --> 50:14.482
-No, go ahead.
-Thank you.

50:16.448 --> 50:18.068
-Open those eyes for me.
-Hmm-hmm!

50:18.137 --> 50:19.413
Eyes open.

50:20.793 --> 50:22.310
-Ah!
-Yeah!

50:22.344 --> 50:24.068
Yeah, you've got
quite a concussion.

50:24.137 --> 50:25.827
Which you're fortunate because

50:25.862 --> 50:28.206
you know, head injuries
can be real serious.

50:31.586 --> 50:33.620
When can she go home,
Harrington?

50:33.689 --> 50:35.241
I'll write a prescription
for the headache

50:35.310 --> 50:38.482
you're definitely
going to have.

50:38.517 --> 50:40.896
But she shouldn't
be alone for a while.

50:40.965 --> 50:44.413
-I'm gonna be fine.
-Hey, hey.

50:44.482 --> 50:47.172
Okay, hey, easy,
take it easy, okay?

50:47.241 --> 50:49.827
Yeah, yeah, excuse me.
Uh, look...

50:49.931 --> 50:51.413
Hey...

50:53.241 --> 50:55.793
Don't worry, I got you.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.586
Yes?

51:02.724 --> 51:03.758
You got it?

51:03.827 --> 51:05.620
Yeah, yeah, thank you,
Harrington.

51:08.724 --> 51:11.068
Jordan, are you sure
you don't want to just rest?

51:11.137 --> 51:13.482
Miles said take it easy.

51:13.551 --> 51:14.551
I'm fine.

51:16.482 --> 51:18.896
All right.

51:19.000 --> 51:23.793
Besides... I have a surprise.

51:23.862 --> 51:25.206
And what is this?

51:25.241 --> 51:26.896
Elisha's laptop.

51:29.241 --> 51:31.482
How did do you get
Elisha's laptop?

51:31.551 --> 51:34.689
Well, after I spoke
to Ernie Reynold's wife,

51:34.758 --> 51:37.310
I went by Elisha's office
at the foundation.

51:37.379 --> 51:39.896
I told her assistant
that I needed to

51:39.931 --> 51:43.827
gather some information
for the Boule announcement.

51:43.896 --> 51:47.551
And her laptop
was just on her desk.

51:49.862 --> 51:51.206
Okay.

51:51.241 --> 51:52.793
Okay, let's see.

51:55.413 --> 51:57.551
No, it's not her birthday.

51:59.586 --> 52:02.551
Hmm. Well, maybe it's something
to do with her daughter.

52:02.620 --> 52:05.965
Maybe, uh, songs or lyric...

52:06.068 --> 52:07.724
You know what?

52:07.793 --> 52:10.103
Her daughter was named after a
character in her favorite book.

52:10.172 --> 52:13.034
She must have read it like
a hundred times in college.

52:18.896 --> 52:20.793
-There we go!
-We're in.

52:20.896 --> 52:22.275
Here we go.

52:24.758 --> 52:26.310
Hmm...

52:26.379 --> 52:28.275
My affair
with your husband...

52:29.793 --> 52:31.275
What is this?

52:34.103 --> 52:35.965
Oh, my God!

52:36.034 --> 52:38.793
It looks like someone
was sending Elisha

52:38.862 --> 52:41.689
emails for over a year,
taunting her.

52:41.758 --> 52:43.275
Hmm. let me see.

52:45.103 --> 52:48.482
And really explicit details...

52:48.551 --> 52:51.862
of all their sexual
rendezvous around town.

52:51.931 --> 52:53.620
Hmm!

52:53.689 --> 52:54.965
Wait, hold on!

52:57.379 --> 52:59.965
Your husband doesn't
want you anymore.

53:00.034 --> 53:02.965
He's laying in my bed
night after night...

53:03.034 --> 53:05.000
when you think
he's at the hospital.

53:06.344 --> 53:08.379
This is crazy.

53:08.482 --> 53:10.517
And the email is untraceable.

53:12.206 --> 53:15.379
And of course I can't ask the
department's tech to look up

53:15.448 --> 53:17.172
the IP address, 'cause...

53:17.206 --> 53:18.965
Without raising flags
with the chief.

53:19.034 --> 53:22.689
Actually I might know someone
who can help us.

53:32.172 --> 53:33.379
Well, hello.

53:33.482 --> 53:34.517
To what do I owe the pleasure

53:34.551 --> 53:36.034
of this bedtime phone call?

53:36.103 --> 53:39.379
Um, hey, Thomas.
I need a favor.

53:39.482 --> 53:41.689
Anything for you.

53:41.724 --> 53:45.862
I need to trace an
IP address from an email.

53:45.896 --> 53:47.965
Do you think you could have
someone look at it?

53:48.034 --> 53:49.482
Yeah. No problem.

53:49.517 --> 53:51.517
Send it over.

53:51.551 --> 53:53.931
So I think you got some friends
in mighty high places.

53:56.034 --> 53:57.517
So...

53:59.000 --> 54:02.103
What else do you think that
Miles is been hiding?

54:02.206 --> 54:03.689
I don't know.

54:05.344 --> 54:06.931
But whatever it is, it was...

54:07.000 --> 54:09.068
worth someone tryin'
to kill me over.

54:09.137 --> 54:11.413
All right, listen, I'm leaving
at the end of the week, so...

54:12.620 --> 54:14.482
we need to figure
this out quickly.

54:16.758 --> 54:19.931
Wait, hold on.
What-what is this?

54:21.344 --> 54:26.034
It looks like she...
signed a lease for a townhome.

54:28.172 --> 54:30.758
Do you think she was planning
on leaving Miles?

54:30.862 --> 54:32.758
Well...

54:32.862 --> 54:34.586
there's only one way
to find out.

54:34.620 --> 54:36.827
How do we even get in
to the townhouse?

54:38.068 --> 54:40.000
One second.

54:41.896 --> 54:44.413
It's my turn to call
a little favor from a friend.

54:46.103 --> 54:48.034
Hey!

54:48.103 --> 54:50.172
Yeah, yeah, doing good.

54:50.241 --> 54:52.482
Huh, can you do me
a little favor?

54:53.448 --> 54:55.310
Oh, I'm sorry, one sec.

55:11.172 --> 55:13.000
Well, that was nice of
your girlfriend to call

55:13.034 --> 55:15.482
the security guard to
let us into the development.

55:18.068 --> 55:19.482
Yes, it was.

55:20.827 --> 55:23.931
Simone's sold a couple of
units in the complex, so

55:24.000 --> 55:25.896
it was a pretty
easy call to make.

55:25.965 --> 55:28.655
There's nothing
of Elisha's inside.

55:32.172 --> 55:35.586
So why did she sign
a lease in this neighborhood?

55:38.103 --> 55:42.827
This area was once controlled by
the city's most grimiest gang

55:42.931 --> 55:44.172
Triple Crowns,

55:44.241 --> 55:47.655
until a real estate
development company,

55:47.689 --> 55:49.586
by the name of
BlackCourt Holdings,

55:49.655 --> 55:51.724
started buying
everything in sight.

55:53.586 --> 55:56.482
Well, on another note...

55:59.103 --> 56:02.655
I see you wearing
that perfume that I love.

56:02.724 --> 56:04.379
I never stopped wearing it
after you gave it

56:04.413 --> 56:06.034
to me for Valentine's Day.

56:11.620 --> 56:13.551
Why aren't you responding?

56:15.413 --> 56:17.551
I can't stop
thinking about you.

56:19.896 --> 56:23.896
And... can't stop
thinking about us.

56:25.034 --> 56:27.448
I got a little
confession for you.

56:30.310 --> 56:34.172
The night you left New Orleans
after your mother's funeral...

56:35.724 --> 56:38.172
I was coming
over to propose.

56:38.241 --> 56:39.724
What?

56:44.793 --> 56:46.724
I don't know what to say.

56:49.551 --> 56:52.172
You could've said yes.

56:52.241 --> 56:54.000
I loved you so much.

56:55.206 --> 56:56.724
But...

56:59.517 --> 57:01.793
But you left me.

57:01.862 --> 57:03.689
You know why I left.

57:04.793 --> 57:06.620
We had been
fighting for weeks.

57:08.172 --> 57:13.482
The stress of taking care
of my mom and juggling work...

57:13.551 --> 57:17.655
it was just too painful to stay
in New Orleans after she died.

57:17.724 --> 57:20.241
So when I got an offer
to go to DC

57:20.310 --> 57:24.517
and run a lab,
that is what I needed.

57:28.965 --> 57:30.655
Why didn't you come with me?

57:30.724 --> 57:34.137
âª Praying that
I'm strong enough âª

57:34.206 --> 57:38.448
âª You thinking
I'm strong enough oh no âª

57:42.379 --> 57:47.413
âª Leaving you was hard enough
hard enough âª

57:55.655 --> 57:58.965
âª You thinking
I'm strong enough âª

58:05.000 --> 58:07.689
âª I don't know really know
what to do âª

58:07.724 --> 58:09.172
âª I have a million questions

58:09.206 --> 58:11.655
âª I've been all alone
away from you âª

58:11.724 --> 58:14.689
âª Baby I've been stressing
I wish I could say âª

58:14.793 --> 58:17.172
âª You stole my heart... âª

58:22.689 --> 58:26.034
Hello? Earth to Jordan.

58:26.068 --> 58:31.310
I'm sorry, girl,
this dress is everything.

58:31.379 --> 58:32.827
You did the damn thing.

58:32.862 --> 58:36.379
Yes, I did.
But what's going on?

58:36.448 --> 58:38.758
You worried about the house
not selling or something?

58:40.482 --> 58:42.551
No, it's just...

58:42.655 --> 58:44.034
I'm just trying to find
more information

58:44.068 --> 58:46.689
on the suspect that the
police say killed Elisha.

58:49.655 --> 58:51.206
What information?

58:51.275 --> 58:53.344
The cops already said his car
matches the one at the

58:53.379 --> 58:56.172
scene, and that street cams
caught him in the area.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.103
But that doesn't explain
why someone came to my house.

59:03.172 --> 59:05.448
You don't believe this was
a some random break-in?

59:05.551 --> 59:09.379
Am I surprised that someone
broke into your townhome? No.

59:09.448 --> 59:13.896
Do I believe that a guy with a
hundred DUIs killed our friend?

59:13.931 --> 59:16.379
Yes. Case closed.

59:18.034 --> 59:20.586
Personally,
I'm glad his ass is dead.

59:34.758 --> 59:37.758
Yo, that shit hurt, doc.
Hurry up.

59:40.482 --> 59:42.758
Easy. Okay.

59:44.620 --> 59:47.068
You didn't tell me how you got
this knife wound on your arm.

59:47.103 --> 59:48.793
Not sure you want
to know that.

59:48.862 --> 59:50.931
Lots going on in these streets.
Ya feel me?

59:52.931 --> 59:55.379
Do you need any help,
Dr. Harrington?

59:55.448 --> 59:59.172
No, no. I'm almost done here.
All right. Thank you.

59:59.241 --> 01:00:01.793
Well, I just thought you'd
want to know the stabbing victim

01:00:01.896 --> 01:00:04.413
you operated on this afternoon
didn't make it.

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:06.000
Police are on their way.

01:00:11.517 --> 01:00:14.068
Oh, excuse me, I'm looking
for Dr. Harrington.

01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:17.344
-He's in exam bay number three.
-Thank you.

01:00:20.068 --> 01:00:22.586
I'll be back tomorrow, Doc.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.551
Make sure you're here.
We good?

01:00:25.586 --> 01:00:27.413
Yeah. Yeah!

01:00:27.448 --> 01:00:29.448
I'll see you tomorrow and
I'll check on those stitches

01:00:29.517 --> 01:00:33.241
and... I'll get that
prescription for you.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.689
Hmm-hm!

01:00:37.275 --> 01:00:40.827
Hey, Jordan.
What are you doing here?

01:00:40.896 --> 01:00:42.379
I was just coming by to see

01:00:42.448 --> 01:00:44.172
if you could check up
my head again.

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:47.448
I'm hoping to get rid of this
bandage before the Boule.

01:00:47.517 --> 01:00:50.724
I also was wondering if
I could take you to dinner.

01:00:50.758 --> 01:00:52.689
We haven't really had a chance

01:00:52.758 --> 01:00:54.379
to really spend
any time together.

01:00:54.448 --> 01:00:56.379
Yeah, you know what,
that sounds great.

01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:59.241
Let me just finish
this paperwork here

01:00:59.275 --> 01:01:01.172
and I'll come back and check on
that head, okay?

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.000
-Thank you.
-All right.

01:01:35.172 --> 01:01:38.068
Hey. Thanks again for staying
for the Grand Boule.

01:01:38.137 --> 01:01:40.310
It really means
a lot to mother.

01:01:41.896 --> 01:01:44.758
-And me too.
-Happy to.

01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:46.379
You know, you're lucky
to be alive.

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:50.068
And you were lucky
to be married to Elisha.

01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:55.310
So then, why did you
cheat on her?

01:02:06.068 --> 01:02:08.758
It's not something
that I'm proud of.

01:02:08.862 --> 01:02:11.758
And nothing's happening right
now, I can promise you that.

01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:13.724
Okay? It-it all ended
a year ago.

01:02:13.827 --> 01:02:16.482
-Who was it?
-It was a nurse.

01:02:16.551 --> 01:02:18.862
Nurse at the hospital.

01:02:18.896 --> 01:02:20.206
Does she still work there?

01:02:20.241 --> 01:02:22.413
No. She moved to Shreveport.

01:02:22.517 --> 01:02:24.862
We both agreed that
it was for the best.

01:02:24.896 --> 01:02:27.034
How could you do that to Elisha?

01:02:28.379 --> 01:02:29.862
To your daughter?

01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:32.724
What I did was wrong,
I know that.

01:02:32.827 --> 01:02:34.241
Okay?

01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:37.413
That affair was the
worst mistake of my life.

01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:39.068
Yeah, when Elisha found
out about it,

01:02:39.137 --> 01:02:43.137
after she found out about it,
she confronted me.

01:02:43.206 --> 01:02:45.241
Look, we went-we went to
counseling for a year

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:47.551
just to repair this marriage.

01:02:47.586 --> 01:02:49.896
We worked hard, both of us.

01:02:51.482 --> 01:02:56.551
Our marriage, our marriage was
in such a, such a good place.

01:02:56.655 --> 01:02:59.965
We... even made plans of

01:03:00.034 --> 01:03:02.379
finally moving out
of mother's estate.

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:07.448
Why? Elisha loved that place.

01:03:10.448 --> 01:03:12.103
Let's just say
it was about time.

01:03:13.655 --> 01:03:16.413
We found this nice, beautiful

01:03:16.482 --> 01:03:18.655
plot of land to
build our dream home on.

01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:21.586
We knew that it will take about
a year for us to build it.

01:03:21.655 --> 01:03:25.310
So, Elisha went out and found a
beautiful townhouse for us

01:03:25.413 --> 01:03:28.758
to stay in just until
it was finished being built.

01:03:28.793 --> 01:03:30.586
Now-now she's gone.

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.965
Hey, you two.

01:03:32.034 --> 01:03:33.965
I saw you on the window.

01:03:34.034 --> 01:03:35.206
You don't mind if I join,
do you?

01:03:35.275 --> 01:03:37.448
Oh, please. Sit down.

01:03:37.517 --> 01:03:38.793
Right.

01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:40.931
Ashton's at my cousin's tonight,

01:03:40.965 --> 01:03:44.448
so mama is a free woman.

01:03:44.482 --> 01:03:48.103
I... I stopped by the hospital
to take Miles to dinner.

01:03:49.827 --> 01:03:53.862
We really haven't had a chance
to talk since the funeral.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:56.275
Yeah, how have you been, Miles?

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:59.965
I feel like I haven't
talked to you in so long.

01:04:00.068 --> 01:04:02.103
You have been getting
my messages, right?

01:04:03.551 --> 01:04:05.689
I've actually been
staying busy at the hospital

01:04:05.724 --> 01:04:08.517
because whenever I'm home,
all I can do is

01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.344
think about my wife

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.586
laying on the side of the road,

01:04:12.655 --> 01:04:15.586
scared, cold...

01:04:17.965 --> 01:04:19.448
alone.

01:04:22.103 --> 01:04:26.000
Sorry, must be so hard
on you and Amaya Grace.

01:04:38.034 --> 01:04:39.482
What the hell, Marcus?

01:04:39.551 --> 01:04:41.344
So this why you needed
to get into the townhouse

01:04:41.379 --> 01:04:43.034
so you could screw
your ex-girlfriend!

01:04:43.137 --> 01:04:45.103
On the balcony, really?

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.344
I can't believe you.

01:04:47.413 --> 01:04:49.000
Don't touch me!

01:04:54.344 --> 01:04:56.931
Well, well,
what do we have here?

01:05:01.413 --> 01:05:04.000
Detective, perhaps
we should talk in my office.

01:05:06.655 --> 01:05:08.068
Detective!

01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:24.413
âª Praying that
I'm strong enough âª

01:05:24.448 --> 01:05:28.758
âª You think
I'm strong enough oh no âª

01:06:54.517 --> 01:06:56.344
Jordan, last night,
you sent me a text

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:58.344
saying that we made a mistake.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:00.482
And this morning,
it's, "911, get over here."

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.896
So, please, tell me
which one is it?

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:05.689
What took you so long?
I texted you over an hour ago.

01:07:05.758 --> 01:07:08.241
I'm sorry, I was meeting
with my union rep

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.310
about my newly
instated suspension.

01:07:12.413 --> 01:07:14.551
-Suspension? For what?
-Yes.

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:16.482
Suspension...

01:07:16.551 --> 01:07:19.724
For behavior unbecoming of a
police officer while on duty.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.896
Someone sent pictures of us

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.241
on that balcony last night

01:07:26.344 --> 01:07:29.103
to Simone and the
entire department.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.724
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I am.

01:07:33.793 --> 01:07:35.413
Serious.

01:07:35.517 --> 01:07:39.241
Maybe that's the person who
broke into my house last night.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.862
Elisha's laptop is missing.

01:07:47.482 --> 01:07:48.896
Well...

01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:51.413
Okay, well, hey...

01:07:51.517 --> 01:07:53.655
Are you sure you just didn't
forget where you put it?

01:07:55.034 --> 01:07:56.413
When I went to sleep last night

01:07:56.517 --> 01:07:58.000
the laptop was
on the nightstand.

01:07:58.068 --> 01:08:00.793
I know that because my phone
was on top of it.

01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:02.448
Your phone...

01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:04.793
Was that before or after
you sent this?

01:08:04.862 --> 01:08:05.965
"We made a mistake."

01:08:09.482 --> 01:08:12.103
We did make a mistake.

01:08:12.137 --> 01:08:13.793
Can we please just focus
on the fact that

01:08:13.896 --> 01:08:16.827
someone came into my
house last night?

01:08:16.896 --> 01:08:20.862
When I woke up, my phone was
there but the laptop was gone.

01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:22.275
Well...

01:08:24.137 --> 01:08:26.310
Yeah, someone must now know

01:08:26.413 --> 01:08:28.137
that we're looking
into Elisha's death.

01:08:28.241 --> 01:08:30.103
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

01:08:30.137 --> 01:08:31.448
But who?

01:08:35.758 --> 01:08:40.034
Why don't you... call him
and ask him?

01:08:40.103 --> 01:08:41.448
Beautiful.

01:08:43.965 --> 01:08:45.620
I can call Thomas later.

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:51.793
You know, when I was
at the hospital...

01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:54.793
Miles was stitching up
a patient.

01:08:54.862 --> 01:08:57.137
This guy with that...

01:08:57.206 --> 01:08:58.689
Three Crowns tattoo.

01:09:00.862 --> 01:09:02.551
I could've sworn
it was the same guy

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.344
I saw at Tamera's boutique.

01:09:10.275 --> 01:09:11.758
Wow.

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.206
Interesting part is...

01:09:16.275 --> 01:09:20.379
usually them gangsters don't
even seek hospital... treatment

01:09:20.482 --> 01:09:21.862
'cause they're scared they gonna
attract attention

01:09:21.965 --> 01:09:23.517
from most cops.

01:09:23.551 --> 01:09:25.172
So the real question is

01:09:25.206 --> 01:09:27.241
what could he possibly
want with Miles?

01:09:29.931 --> 01:09:32.000
From what I overheard,

01:09:32.034 --> 01:09:34.344
it sounded like they
had unfinished business.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Ah!

01:09:45.034 --> 01:09:49.206
Look at this beautiful boy.

01:09:49.275 --> 01:09:51.206
Tamera, he looks
just like you.

01:09:51.275 --> 01:09:52.965
That's mama's little man.

01:09:53.034 --> 01:09:54.793
Aww!

01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:56.034
So sweet.

01:09:56.137 --> 01:09:58.689
Oh, thanks for stopping by
to pick up the dress.

01:09:58.724 --> 01:10:01.689
I just finished the
alterations last night.

01:10:03.448 --> 01:10:05.206
For you, my dear.

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:07.862
The Belle of the Boule.

01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:11.344
Thank you.

01:10:11.413 --> 01:10:12.862
I appreciate it.

01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:17.586
Girl, what's wrong?
You look stressed.

01:10:20.206 --> 01:10:21.517
Did you know that
Miles and Elisha

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.448
were having marital problems?

01:10:23.517 --> 01:10:25.689
Problems? What do you mean?

01:10:25.724 --> 01:10:31.172
Last year, Elisha found out
that Miles was having an affair.

01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:32.965
Miles?

01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:34.655
No!

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.551
He would never cheat on Elisha.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.344
No, I found the emails that
Elisha sent to the other woman.

01:10:40.379 --> 01:10:42.689
What?

01:10:42.793 --> 01:10:45.517
So you know who this woman is?

01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:48.758
He claims it's one of the
nurses at the hospital.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:50.551
I have somebody
looking into it.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.103
Why would he lie about cheating
on Elisha with a nurse?

01:10:55.793 --> 01:10:56.862
I don't know.

01:10:57.965 --> 01:10:59.862
Have you ever heard of...

01:11:01.275 --> 01:11:03.724
Mayfair Springs
Luxury Townhomes

01:11:03.758 --> 01:11:06.482
owned by BlackCourt Holdings?

01:11:07.758 --> 01:11:10.034
No, why?

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:13.793
She had a lease agreement
for a townhome there.

01:11:13.862 --> 01:11:18.034
I'm wondering if she was
thinking about leaving Miles.

01:11:18.103 --> 01:11:20.448
And, I mean, what if
he found out and...

01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:22.965
And what, girl?
He killed her?

01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:25.758
I mean, even if Miles was having
an affair with someone

01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:27.655
he doesn't want you
to know about,

01:11:27.724 --> 01:11:29.827
doesn't mean he killed her.

01:11:29.896 --> 01:11:31.931
Girl, I really do think
that concussion

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.344
messed with your head.

01:11:41.517 --> 01:11:43.482
I'm telling you.

01:11:43.551 --> 01:11:45.448
Something is not right.

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.068
Girl, will you please stop
running around

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.758
playing CSI New Orleans?

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.103
Sorry.

01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:55.758
Please just try on the dress.

01:11:55.793 --> 01:11:57.827
I'm gonna go check
on Miles's baby sister.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:11:59.068
While you do that.

01:12:00.551 --> 01:12:02.068
You're right.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:16.482
Jordan?

01:12:16.517 --> 01:12:18.482
-Jordan?
-I'm in here.

01:12:26.758 --> 01:12:28.000
Wow!

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.482
My God!

01:12:32.517 --> 01:12:34.482
You look absolutely beautiful.

01:12:37.965 --> 01:12:39.413
Um...

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.655
Do you mind helping me
with my zipper?

01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:46.482
Sure.

01:12:55.965 --> 01:12:57.379
Marcus, we can't.

01:12:57.448 --> 01:12:59.000
Why?

01:12:59.103 --> 01:13:01.724
Is it because
you're with Thomas?

01:13:03.413 --> 01:13:05.034
Aren't you with Simone?

01:13:06.034 --> 01:13:07.551
Simone isn't you.

01:13:12.413 --> 01:13:15.862
âª Sometimes bad girls

01:13:15.896 --> 01:13:18.379
âª Gotta take...

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:31.344
âª Come on come on come on

01:13:38.758 --> 01:13:41.000
Jordan, come on out here
so I can see

01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:44.068
if there's anything else
I need to do to the dress.

01:13:44.137 --> 01:13:45.724
Okay.

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:56.896
Girl, this red
is popping on you.

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:58.551
Whoo!

01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:01.793
Oh!

01:14:03.034 --> 01:14:06.413
Well, hey, Marcus.
What are you doing here?

01:14:06.448 --> 01:14:07.827
Uh, hey, Tamera.

01:14:07.931 --> 01:14:10.034
I just came by to give Jordan
a little update.

01:14:10.103 --> 01:14:11.413
Hmm. An update?

01:14:11.482 --> 01:14:13.620
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

01:14:13.689 --> 01:14:16.689
Stop. Marcus, you should go.

01:14:16.758 --> 01:14:18.275
We need to finish this dress.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:19.793
The Boule is this weekend.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.448
Have a good day, lady.

01:14:25.551 --> 01:14:26.965
Bye, Marcus.

01:14:27.793 --> 01:14:29.793
Tamera...

01:14:29.827 --> 01:14:33.620
Girl, you got a little
sneaky link going on in here.

01:14:33.655 --> 01:14:35.206
You know, like that.

01:14:35.275 --> 01:14:36.758
It's-it's nothing.

01:14:36.793 --> 01:14:38.275
Girl, who're you fooling?

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:41.034
It is clear by the look
on both of your faces

01:14:41.103 --> 01:14:43.620
that you both still
have feelings

01:14:43.724 --> 01:14:45.827
Look...

01:14:45.896 --> 01:14:48.793
I just need to find out what
really happened to Elisha

01:14:48.862 --> 01:14:51.068
and then I can
get back to DC.

01:14:51.137 --> 01:14:52.758
Back to my life.

01:14:52.793 --> 01:14:54.827
There's no Marcus.

01:14:54.896 --> 01:14:58.068
I don't know why you insist
on lying to yourself,

01:14:58.137 --> 01:15:01.655
but what I do know is that
this dress is perfection.

01:15:01.689 --> 01:15:03.965
-Hmm!
-Hmm-hm.

01:15:04.034 --> 01:15:05.655
It is!

01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:07.413
And with two days to spare.

01:15:07.482 --> 01:15:09.000
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.620
Thank you.

01:15:14.137 --> 01:15:16.068
All right,
I'm gonna take it off.

01:15:21.103 --> 01:15:24.931
Look, wait...
No, we need to meet.

01:15:26.551 --> 01:15:28.000
I don't care what you think.

01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:34.103
Jordan's been asking
too many questions.

01:15:38.275 --> 01:15:41.827
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

01:15:41.862 --> 01:15:43.517
You need to keep
your mouth shut.

01:15:43.551 --> 01:15:46.034
I heard you've been talking to
the wrong people.

01:15:46.137 --> 01:15:47.896
And if you want to
keep the pension

01:15:47.965 --> 01:15:50.551
and the rest of the money,
you'll shut the hell up.

01:15:50.655 --> 01:15:54.034
Well, look who's
giving orders now.

01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:56.896
What you think,
you big shit?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.931
You think them people
up there gonna ever see

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.275
you for more than you are?

01:16:01.344 --> 01:16:05.379
Girl, you ain't nothing, but
trash from the Ninth Ward?

01:16:05.448 --> 01:16:08.206
You always thought you was
better than somebody ever since

01:16:08.275 --> 01:16:11.206
you started hanging out
with that Harrington girl.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:14.896
You turned your back
on your own blood.

01:16:14.931 --> 01:16:17.241
After me and Ernie
raised your ass.

01:16:18.758 --> 01:16:20.482
Anyway...

01:16:20.551 --> 01:16:22.275
Ernie is dead now.

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:25.068
So if you want me
to stop talking,

01:16:25.103 --> 01:16:27.448
I'm going to need
some more money.

01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:29.379
'Cause that pension alone
ain't going to keep me

01:16:29.448 --> 01:16:31.758
in the style of livin'
I become accustom to.

01:16:32.862 --> 01:16:35.586
So you better get me
some more money.

01:16:35.655 --> 01:16:37.758
You'll get your money.

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.551
I know that's all you
ever cared about.

01:16:47.862 --> 01:16:49.965
I'm gonna leave you.

01:16:50.034 --> 01:16:53.586
I want you to lock that door and
make sure nobody comes in, okay?

01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.241
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

01:16:57.344 --> 01:16:59.931
I'mma go home
and I'm gonna get some clothes

01:16:59.965 --> 01:17:02.172
and I'm gonna come here and
stay with you for tonight.

01:17:02.241 --> 01:17:04.275
But first, I'm gonna stop by
the station to see

01:17:04.344 --> 01:17:06.827
if there's any word
on your break-in.

01:17:06.896 --> 01:17:08.482
-Marcus.
-Yes?

01:17:08.517 --> 01:17:11.448
You don't have to babysit me.
He's not gonna to come back.

01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:13.034
I want to be here to make sure.

01:17:15.724 --> 01:17:17.000
All right.

01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:19.827
-Okay.
-Goodnight.

01:17:21.517 --> 01:17:24.827
I will not... lose you again.

01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:32.241
Now... I know you probably
have not been shooting...

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:33.344
Hmm-hmm, no.

01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:35.482
Touissant, you look
at me and listen.

01:17:38.413 --> 01:17:41.310
This is a loaded weapon.

01:17:42.827 --> 01:17:44.827
And what I need you to do...

01:17:45.758 --> 01:17:48.896
You unload this entire magazine

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:51.827
if anybody but me
comes through that door.

01:17:54.379 --> 01:17:55.689
Okay?

01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:58.448
-Let me hear you say it. Okay?
-Okay.

01:17:58.482 --> 01:18:00.379
Okay.

01:18:00.448 --> 01:18:01.517
Okay.

01:18:04.137 --> 01:18:05.827
I will see you soon.

01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:22.034
You know...

01:18:24.241 --> 01:18:28.517
I told Elisha to watch out
for the likes of you.

01:18:28.586 --> 01:18:31.379
You're not just one
of our kind of people.

01:18:32.724 --> 01:18:37.206
Trash will always be trash.

01:18:38.827 --> 01:18:41.862
You were a
conniving manipulator

01:18:41.896 --> 01:18:45.379
riding on Elisha's
pedigree coattails.

01:18:45.413 --> 01:18:49.689
Always begging to borrow money
for your little boutique.

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.517
-That was an investment.
-Oh!

01:18:51.551 --> 01:18:53.206
Elisha believed in me.

01:18:53.275 --> 01:18:54.724
Okay!

01:18:54.827 --> 01:18:57.896
So what did you do
to repay her?

01:18:57.965 --> 01:19:00.896
Sleep with her husband.

01:19:00.931 --> 01:19:05.448
But I guess if your
mother's a whore...

01:19:05.482 --> 01:19:08.931
why would you grow up
to be any different?

01:19:08.965 --> 01:19:11.931
Little girl, don't you dare.

01:19:11.965 --> 01:19:14.793
I wasn't surprised
when my son was seduced

01:19:14.862 --> 01:19:17.586
by his wife's best friend,

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.448
I was just disappointed...

01:19:20.482 --> 01:19:24.758
that he had to knock your
raggedy ass up.

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.655
And I had to clean up his mess.

01:19:27.758 --> 01:19:30.275
I need money if you want
this plan to continue.

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:34.586
Jordan's been sniffing around
and...

01:19:34.655 --> 01:19:36.586
she's starting to
put the pieces together.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:38.034
Hmm.

01:19:41.103 --> 01:19:43.172
I don't have enough money
in the house.

01:19:46.034 --> 01:19:48.034
But you can make this work.

01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:53.689
Oh, and take your
little bastard with you.

01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:15.275
Yes, she's becoming a problem.

01:20:16.413 --> 01:20:18.034
Fix it.

01:20:18.103 --> 01:20:20.310
The Grand Boule is this weekend.

01:20:20.413 --> 01:20:23.586
And that bitch can't ruin
my announcement.

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:41.482
-Hey, girl!
-Hey, Tam.

01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.275
I was just calling
to let you know that

01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:44.793
I'm not going to make it
dinner tonight.

01:20:44.896 --> 01:20:47.275
Marcus is gonna stop by later.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:49.137
Oh, we should actually find out

01:20:49.206 --> 01:20:51.275
who Miles was having
an affair with tonight.

01:20:54.206 --> 01:20:56.275
Look, girl, all I care
about is you. Okay?

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.758
Um... I need to run
a few errands.

01:20:58.827 --> 01:21:00.827
I'm gonna drop Ashton off
at the babysitters.

01:21:00.862 --> 01:21:03.482
But I'll be right over, okay?

01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:06.379
But, girl, you do not have
to come over here.

01:21:06.448 --> 01:21:08.344
I told you, Marcus is coming.
I'll be fine.

01:21:08.379 --> 01:21:11.862
No, you shouldn't be alone.
Okay?

01:21:11.965 --> 01:21:14.517
I'll be right over.
I love you.

01:21:14.586 --> 01:21:16.172
I love you too. Okay.

01:21:53.379 --> 01:21:55.379
What are you doing back in my
station when you're suspended?

01:21:55.448 --> 01:21:58.000
I heard over the radio that
Dayveon Simms was brought in

01:21:58.034 --> 01:22:01.241
for suspected break-in
at my friend's house.

01:22:01.275 --> 01:22:03.448
And I want to see
what he had to say.

01:22:03.517 --> 01:22:05.517
This city has over
a 100 murders a year.

01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:08.068
We don't have the time or
manpower to waste precious

01:22:08.103 --> 01:22:09.931
resources on a break-in
where no one was

01:22:10.034 --> 01:22:11.827
seriously hurt and
nothing of value taken.

01:22:11.896 --> 01:22:13.103
She was assaulted.

01:22:13.206 --> 01:22:14.724
Let me shoot straight so even

01:22:14.758 --> 01:22:17.241
you can understand, detective.

01:22:17.275 --> 01:22:18.620
You've been looking
into some things

01:22:18.689 --> 01:22:20.758
that don't really require
your attention.

01:22:20.862 --> 01:22:22.586
Take this suspension seriously

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.655
before I throw you
off the force permanently.

01:22:25.724 --> 01:22:27.241
Do I make myself clear?

01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:32.517
Hmm.

01:22:34.931 --> 01:22:36.103
Yes, sir.

01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:52.172
-Knock-knock.
-Oh, my God! Girl!

01:22:52.241 --> 01:22:56.103
Tamera, you do not have
to wait on me.

01:22:56.172 --> 01:22:59.103
Really, I told you, I'm fine.

01:22:59.206 --> 01:23:00.758
Babe, it's my pleasure.

01:23:02.068 --> 01:23:04.689
Just drink a little tea
and relax.

01:23:04.758 --> 01:23:07.655
And I'll just stay
until Marcus comes back.

01:23:09.137 --> 01:23:10.310
This is really good.

01:23:10.344 --> 01:23:12.068
-Glad you like it.
-Hmm.

01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:15.482
Huh-huh-huh!

01:23:15.517 --> 01:23:18.137
Listen to nurse, Tamera. Okay?

01:23:18.172 --> 01:23:20.586
This could wait.
You need to rest.

01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:22.896
Okay, girl.

01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:25.724
You know...

01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:31.034
I really am
so lucky to have you.

01:23:32.517 --> 01:23:34.206
Lucky to have you, honey.

01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:51.586
Tam...

01:23:57.724 --> 01:23:59.482
I am really tired.

01:24:02.068 --> 01:24:03.551
It's okay.

01:24:06.758 --> 01:24:09.724
You bitches always thought
you were better than me.

01:24:09.758 --> 01:24:11.862
You know,
Miles was mine first.

01:24:13.034 --> 01:24:14.724
But once he saw Elisha...

01:24:16.206 --> 01:24:17.896
he forgot all about me.

01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:19.862
Until she had Amaya Grace.

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:23.241
And she was just too tired to
take care of that man's needs.

01:24:23.344 --> 01:24:25.379
It was easy to get him
back in my bed.

01:24:29.344 --> 01:24:35.034
And now Miles can really get
to know his son Ashton.

01:24:38.827 --> 01:24:41.793
It turns out,
I'm gonna get her man...

01:24:41.862 --> 01:24:43.137
and her money.

01:24:55.379 --> 01:24:57.551
Come on, Jordan! Why don't
you pick up the phone?

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.206
Hmm.

01:25:35.275 --> 01:25:36.551
Babe!

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.137
Huh-huh-huh!
Ain't no time for that.

01:25:39.172 --> 01:25:42.482
I've been thinking about them
cakes all the day. Come on.

01:25:42.551 --> 01:25:43.620
I've been thinking
about my money.

01:25:43.724 --> 01:25:45.034
So why don't you stay on task?

01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:46.655
Who you getting loud with?

01:25:46.758 --> 01:25:48.655
My Crowns soldiers
been doing all the work.

01:25:48.724 --> 01:25:50.206
Running folks and business
outta the Ninth.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:51.931
Now stay ready, you feel me?

01:25:51.965 --> 01:25:53.655
I know, baby.

01:25:53.724 --> 01:25:56.965
And you've been doing
such a great job.

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:59.000
Block by block.

01:25:59.103 --> 01:26:02.655
No one would ever think that
New Orleans' most notorious

01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:04.724
hitters was working for me...

01:26:04.793 --> 01:26:06.862
and those blue blood
Harrington's.

01:26:08.034 --> 01:26:10.172
But we did that.

01:26:10.206 --> 01:26:11.896
You're damn right.

01:26:11.965 --> 01:26:15.034
We just have a couple
of loose ends, that's all.

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.862
Gotta get rid of Jordan
before Marcus comes back.

01:26:21.482 --> 01:26:23.275
Go to the boutique,
get the materials

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.689
wrap up the body
so we can dump her.

01:26:24.724 --> 01:26:27.344
-We ain't got much time.
-Hmm-hmm.

01:26:27.379 --> 01:26:29.862
Yo, Tam?

01:26:29.965 --> 01:26:31.034
Damn, Dayveon.

01:26:31.103 --> 01:26:33.517
Didn't I just say we
ain't got much time?

01:26:40.379 --> 01:26:42.344
What you 'bout to do, Day-Day?

01:26:42.379 --> 01:26:43.724
I put you on.

01:26:43.827 --> 01:26:45.344
Triple Crowns wouldn't be
gettin' this paper

01:26:45.379 --> 01:26:46.724
if it wasn't for me.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:48.344
Boy, put that gun away.
Quit playin'.

01:26:48.413 --> 01:26:50.172
Sorry, my baby.

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:51.448
It's time for you to exit,

01:26:51.517 --> 01:26:53.206
so the Crown's
got a bigger piece.

01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:56.172
See, no matter
how good that ass is,

01:26:56.206 --> 01:26:57.931
the game always gonna
be the game.

01:27:00.517 --> 01:27:02.413
Ashton needs me.
Please don't do this.

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:03.758
No, no, no...

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:21.034
Yeah. It's done.

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:23.862
I'll move the body,
so you can pin it on the cop.

01:27:23.931 --> 01:27:26.344
Just make sure you come
through on her cut.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.241
Oh, you waking up. Huh?

01:27:47.275 --> 01:27:48.620
No, huh-huh, huh-huh!

01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:50.482
You shouldn't have been
snooping with that cop,

01:27:50.551 --> 01:27:52.241
you little ass.

01:27:52.275 --> 01:27:55.758
Now you're going to end up dead,
just like you friends.

01:27:57.413 --> 01:28:00.275
But... now we can go ahead

01:28:00.344 --> 01:28:02.551
and have a little fun
together first.

01:28:04.965 --> 01:28:07.827
Yeah! Come here.

01:28:18.344 --> 01:28:21.103
Bitch, you ain't gonna kill me.

01:28:21.172 --> 01:28:22.689
You broke into my house.

01:28:22.793 --> 01:28:25.413
You attacked me.
You killed my friends.

01:28:25.482 --> 01:28:27.068
Why wouldn't I kill you?

01:28:29.862 --> 01:28:32.620
Because I don't want
you to going to jail

01:28:32.655 --> 01:28:34.000
for this piece of shit.

01:28:34.068 --> 01:28:35.655
Oh, you could trust.
I ain't going to jail.

01:28:35.689 --> 01:28:37.310
My lawyer will have me
out in the morn--

01:28:45.793 --> 01:28:47.827
I'm gonna enjoy this one.

01:29:08.655 --> 01:29:12.034
Elisha was a... beautiful soul.

01:29:14.137 --> 01:29:16.517
She loved Miles.

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:18.586
She loved you!

01:29:18.655 --> 01:29:22.689
Tell my son... I did
all of this for him.

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:25.724
-Did what?
-Jordan.

01:29:25.758 --> 01:29:28.724
He didn't understand
what needed to be done.

01:29:32.413 --> 01:29:36.551
Miss Elisha... discovered
that the real estate deals

01:29:36.586 --> 01:29:39.586
that were needed
to sustain our family

01:29:39.689 --> 01:29:42.413
after the distillery collapsed

01:29:42.482 --> 01:29:44.310
were being facilitated by that

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:48.034
bitch Tamera and her gang.

01:29:50.827 --> 01:29:53.172
Come here.

01:29:53.241 --> 01:29:56.965
I gave her the land
for the youth center...

01:29:57.034 --> 01:30:00.862
and it still wasn't enough
to appease her ass.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:04.310
-So you had her killed?
-Oh, hmmm-hmm!

01:30:04.379 --> 01:30:05.896
Don't do that, Jordan.

01:30:07.655 --> 01:30:09.206
Don't judge me.

01:30:12.551 --> 01:30:15.172
She was going
to sell out our family

01:30:15.241 --> 01:30:18.103
and turn my baby,
my son against me.

01:30:19.655 --> 01:30:21.586
What do you think
is going to happen

01:30:21.689 --> 01:30:24.000
when he finds out
what you've done?

01:30:25.413 --> 01:30:26.724
It needed to be done.

01:30:29.896 --> 01:30:33.586
Brenda Grace Harrington...
I'm placing you

01:30:33.655 --> 01:30:36.655
under arrest for the conspiracy
to commit murder.

01:30:37.862 --> 01:30:40.068
You have the right to
remain silent.

01:30:40.172 --> 01:30:42.551
And anything you say can

01:30:42.586 --> 01:30:45.000
and definitely
will be held against you

01:30:45.068 --> 01:30:46.551
in the court of law.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.137
Take her away.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:54.551
Huh! Wow!

01:30:56.862 --> 01:31:00.551
How did Tamera and Brenda Grace
even start working together?

01:31:00.586 --> 01:31:03.620
Well, Tamera blackmailed
Brenda Grace

01:31:03.655 --> 01:31:05.724
into cutting her in
on the BlackCourt deals

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:09.000
or she'd reveal that
Ashton was Miles's son.

01:31:09.068 --> 01:31:12.965
In return, Brenda Grace asked
her to get three Crowns involved

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
to clear out the neighborhood
they were redeveloping.

01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:18.241
And when Elisha found out
about the gang's involvement

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:20.413
with the family's
real estate deals,

01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:25.413
Brenda Grace told Tamera Elisha
had to be dealt with.

01:31:25.448 --> 01:31:27.620
Well, hmm-hmm.

01:31:28.965 --> 01:31:31.172
All right, get this,
when they question Dayveon

01:31:31.275 --> 01:31:34.068
at the hospital last night, and
he realized that he was facing

01:31:34.137 --> 01:31:35.793
the death penalty
for two murders

01:31:35.896 --> 01:31:40.068
and an attempt on your life,

01:31:40.137 --> 01:31:43.482
big bad day to be honest
saying like a canary.

01:31:43.551 --> 01:31:45.448
And told them
all about Tamera's plan.

01:31:45.551 --> 01:31:47.551
But...

01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:49.482
who did Tamera get to pin

01:31:49.551 --> 01:31:51.448
Elisha's murder on
Ernie Reynolds?

01:31:51.517 --> 01:31:53.275
Hmm.

01:31:53.344 --> 01:31:55.448
Slow down.

01:31:55.551 --> 01:31:57.034
That's our next stop.

01:31:58.275 --> 01:31:59.620
Let's go.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:10.862
Hmm. You know Ernie Reynolds?

01:32:10.931 --> 01:32:12.689
Ernie Reynolds
was Tamera's uncle.

01:32:14.551 --> 01:32:16.034
He molested her for years.

01:32:16.103 --> 01:32:17.689
So he was the perfect
person to take

01:32:17.758 --> 01:32:19.034
the fall for Elisha's death.

01:32:19.103 --> 01:32:20.517
And so, the chief had Ernie

01:32:20.551 --> 01:32:21.931
killed and his car dumped.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.793
And it was no problem

01:32:23.862 --> 01:32:25.206
that they didn't find
water in the lungs

01:32:25.275 --> 01:32:27.310
because they had Sully
in their pocket, too.

01:32:27.379 --> 01:32:30.034
You just might make
a cute little detective.

01:32:33.827 --> 01:32:35.620
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:32:41.034 --> 01:32:44.620
âª Not afraid to fly
no fear of falling âª

01:32:46.655 --> 01:32:48.655
Wow, well, well, well...

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:50.172
Oh, my God.

01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:53.344
You look beautiful.

01:32:54.758 --> 01:32:56.655
Thank you.

01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:58.793
You clean up nice yourself.

01:32:58.862 --> 01:33:01.275
Oh, do I? Do I take a
look on the left?

01:33:01.379 --> 01:33:02.586
Oh!

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.172
-What, you Eddie Murphy now?
-Huh, I don't know.

01:33:05.241 --> 01:33:07.275
Not!

01:33:07.344 --> 01:33:08.758
Just Marcus.

01:33:10.758 --> 01:33:13.275
Hey...

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:17.275
You sure you're up for this,
right? We don't have to go.

01:33:17.344 --> 01:33:19.103
They'll forgive you.

01:33:19.172 --> 01:33:20.344
I know.

01:33:21.655 --> 01:33:24.103
But, um...

01:33:24.172 --> 01:33:27.034
I really want to honor
Elisha's memory tonight.

01:33:28.758 --> 01:33:30.310
Thanks for coming with me.

01:33:33.344 --> 01:33:34.931
I'd do anything for you.

01:33:36.482 --> 01:33:37.931
You know I gotcha.

01:33:40.206 --> 01:33:42.137
You know...

01:33:42.241 --> 01:33:48.275
Now that Sully has been put
in jail for falsifying autopsy

01:33:48.344 --> 01:33:53.172
reports and tampering
crime scene evidence,

01:33:53.241 --> 01:33:56.206
you know, our little
old city in New Orleans

01:33:56.275 --> 01:34:01.413
is in desperate need for
a new chief medical examiner.

01:34:01.482 --> 01:34:03.827
Well...

01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:05.827
Maybe it is time
for me to come home.

01:34:08.379 --> 01:34:09.896
Well...

01:34:11.413 --> 01:34:12.724
Welcome home, babe.
