WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.535
(children shouting)
- Too easy!

00:05.372 --> 00:07.506
- Spell "amorous."

00:07.541 --> 00:08.874
- Amorous.

00:08.909 --> 00:13.378
A-M-O-R-U--

00:13.413 --> 00:15.680
- Ah... wrong!

00:15.715 --> 00:18.150
(children exclaiming)
Sit down.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.918
Spell "gorgeous."

00:19.953 --> 00:23.955
- G-O-R-G-I--

00:23.990 --> 00:27.259
- Argh! Sit down,
you butcher of beauty.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.994
(cheering)

00:29.029 --> 00:30.962
Ostracize?

00:30.997 --> 00:33.932
- Go, Gilbert!
- O-S-T...

00:33.967 --> 00:37.269
R-A-C-I-Z-E.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.938
- That would seem to be correct.
(cheering)

00:42.442 --> 00:45.944
Haughty.
- H-A-U-G-H-T-Y.

00:45.979 --> 00:49.981
- Callous.
- C-A-L-L-O-U-S.

00:50.016 --> 00:52.951
(cheering)
- You can do it, Anne!

00:52.986 --> 00:55.754
- Penitent.
- P-E-N...

00:55.789 --> 00:59.324
I-T-E-N-T.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.293
(cheering)

01:03.530 --> 01:05.397
- Intentions.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.232
- I-N-T...

01:07.267 --> 01:11.136
E-N-T-I-O-N-S.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.305
(cheering)

01:15.842 --> 01:17.342
- Persevere.

01:17.377 --> 01:22.347
- P-E-R-S-E-V-E-R-E.

01:22.382 --> 01:25.250
(cheering)

01:26.686 --> 01:29.121
- Engagement.
- E-N-G...

01:29.156 --> 01:34.025
A-G...M--

01:34.060 --> 01:37.896
- That is incorrect.
(cheering)

01:37.931 --> 01:40.232
The spelling,
not the sentiment.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.102
(applause and cheering)
- Anne, you won!

01:45.705 --> 01:47.405
- Congratulations, Anne.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.308
I should've added an E.

01:54.881 --> 01:57.549
- Anne,
are you feeling all right?

(gasping)

02:55.408 --> 02:57.442
(panting)

03:16.863 --> 03:18.530
- Anne?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.500
- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I disturbed you!

03:22.535 --> 03:26.171
I'm so very sorry
you bet on the wrong horse!

03:26.206 --> 03:28.073
- Whatever do you mean?

03:28.108 --> 03:31.142
- I never got
to wear puff sleeves!

03:31.177 --> 03:32.744
- What are you doing there?

03:32.779 --> 03:35.180
- If you want to send me
to the hospital

03:35.215 --> 03:37.949
for the remainder of my days,
I will completely understand!

03:37.984 --> 03:39.551
- You're not dying.

03:39.586 --> 03:43.054
- Will you please plant
some pink roses on my grave?

03:43.089 --> 03:45.691
- Anne, you are not dying.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.829
You're in your...
womanly flowering time,

03:50.864 --> 03:52.664
and it's perfectly normal.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.833
- But I'm not ready
to be a woman!

03:54.868 --> 03:57.802
- Well, it's God's plan
and that's the way of it.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.871
- Oh, there's been some kind
of mistake.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.841
There is no way God would think
that it's time

04:02.876 --> 04:04.442
for me to be a woman!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.478
- Now, now,
let's get you sorted out.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.281
You'll need some cotton cloths
to pin to your undergarments--

04:09.316 --> 04:11.216
- This can't be happening.
- And after,

04:11.251 --> 04:15.186
they'll need to be washed in
cold water first, and then hot.

04:15.221 --> 04:18.490
- Oh, do you have to deal
with this, too?

04:18.525 --> 04:20.358
- I did. For many years.

04:20.393 --> 04:21.993
- Years?!

04:22.028 --> 04:24.429
- Your cycle is just a few days
every month--

04:24.464 --> 04:26.865
- Every month?! But why?!
Why is this happening now?!

04:26.900 --> 04:29.334
Everything was fine
the way it was for once!

04:29.369 --> 04:30.935
- Matthew, out!
- Anne, what's wrong?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.404
- Everything!

04:32.439 --> 04:34.372
- I said out!

04:34.407 --> 04:37.142
- I... uh,

04:37.177 --> 04:39.944
yes... barn...

04:39.979 --> 04:43.648
- This is a waking nightmare.
- Anne...

04:43.683 --> 04:47.585
calm yourself.
My word, you're hysterical.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.921
(Anne sobbing)
- I hate this.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.424
I hate this. I hate this!

04:53.393 --> 04:55.560
- There now.

04:55.595 --> 04:57.429
(sobbing)

05:05.705 --> 05:08.239
Perhaps you should stay home
from school today.

05:08.274 --> 05:11.142
- What?! No, no, no!
I can't lose time, Marilla!

05:11.177 --> 05:12.677
- There's no reason why you--

05:12.712 --> 05:15.013
- No, I need to keep up
my academic record!

05:15.048 --> 05:18.183
I just caught up with Gil...
with the rest of the class!

05:18.218 --> 05:21.720
- Whatever you want, Anne.
Whatever you want.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.058
(groaning)

05:48.948 --> 05:51.183
(man): Thank you.
(coughing)

06:01.761 --> 06:04.229
- Mrs. Kincannon
will be here shortly.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.598
- I'm fine.
You go on to school, son.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.572
- And, um, I'll be home
straight after school.

06:14.607 --> 06:16.641
- All right. Thank you, son.

06:21.948 --> 06:24.116
(wheezing)

06:27.821 --> 06:30.188
(soft, dramatic music)

06:34.327 --> 06:36.161
- Well, good morning,
Mrs. Kincannon.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.729
- Gilbert,
you're late for school.

06:37.764 --> 06:41.132
- I promise I'll get your wages
next week at the bank.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.335
- No worries.
I know where you live.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.481
- It was like something
out of Shakespeare.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.950
- Yet she insisted
on going to school?

06:58.985 --> 07:03.288
- Mercifully, yes. But poor Matthew
had fled the house well before then.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.557
- You may not see him
for a week.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.460
- If you see a suspicious character
foraging in your garden,

07:08.495 --> 07:11.329
please feed him some supper.
(Rachel chuckling)

07:13.833 --> 07:16.234
- Oh, God. I don't miss it.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.303
I'll say it out loud:

07:18.338 --> 07:20.839
I'd rather be pregnant
than menstruating.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.343
- That explains all the children.
(laughter)

07:31.117 --> 07:32.817
(children laughing)

07:32.852 --> 07:35.020
- Shhh. Not so loud.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.524
- I got mine three months ago
and I feel extremely mature.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.026
- You seem mature.
- You do.

07:42.061 --> 07:45.029
- I think the boys
take me more seriously, too.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.498
- But they can't tell.

07:46.533 --> 07:49.367
Can they can tell?
That would be awful.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.503
- Not tell per se.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.938
But I'm not a little girl
anymore,

07:53.973 --> 07:57.108
and I believe that's noticeable.
My bosoms are growing.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.512
- Yet another reason
why this is inexplicable.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.113
- I got mine last year.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.982
- Me, too.
- Really?

08:04.017 --> 08:07.051
- My father has started
opening the door for me.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.653
It's sweet.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.089
- I can't wait
until I can wear my hair up.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.057
(sniffling)

08:13.092 --> 08:14.692
- Ruby, what's wrong?

08:14.727 --> 08:17.595
- I'm not a woman!
Why don't I have it?!

08:17.630 --> 08:20.365
- Trust me, if I could
give you mine, I would.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.033
This is so inconvenient!

08:22.068 --> 08:23.902
- Hush, Anne!
- Keep your voice down.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.705
- No one's supposed to know. A
woman's cycle is a shameful thing.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.374
- Why?

08:29.409 --> 08:31.910
- It's "unmentionable,"
that's why.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.645
- That's not a reason.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.380
- Why don't you ever understand
anything?

08:35.415 --> 08:39.817
- Marilla said it's God's plan,
so doesn't that make it good?

08:39.852 --> 08:43.087
I mean, we can make
a whole person.

08:43.122 --> 08:44.756
Where's the shame in that?

08:44.791 --> 08:47.592
- Am I the only one who thinks
she's out of her mind?

08:47.627 --> 08:50.628
- It's a secret, Anne.
That's just the way it is.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.865
- Do boys have to contend
with anything like this?

08:53.900 --> 08:55.700
- Boys have their own problems.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.937
- Why are they doing that?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.739
(grunting)

09:06.245 --> 09:08.246
- There's a question
for the ages.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.484
- When I get mine,
I stay home from school,

09:13.519 --> 09:15.787
because I don't want
to have an "accident."

09:15.822 --> 09:18.856
- Accident?
- There was a girl a few years ago

09:18.891 --> 09:21.926
who bled right through
the back of her dress.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.529
- Oh, I would die
of mortification.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.332
- The teacher called her
up to the blackboard

09:27.367 --> 09:29.334
and everybody saw.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.303
- I would just die.

09:34.173 --> 09:37.442
- Which districts comprise
the Prairies?

09:37.477 --> 09:38.876
Gilbert.

09:38.911 --> 09:44.616
- Um... the districts
of Athabasca, Alberta,

09:44.651 --> 09:47.552
Saskatchewan and Assiniboia.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.222
- He's so smart.
- Now that is a clever student.

09:51.257 --> 09:56.194
Anne. Which provinces comprise
the Atlantic Maritimes?

10:08.241 --> 10:10.808
- I'm sorry,
what was the question?

10:10.843 --> 10:13.011
- Could you not hear me?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.847
(loudly): Was I not speaking
loudly enough?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.749
- I'm sorry, I just...

10:17.784 --> 10:20.352
- The Atlantic Maritimes!

10:23.256 --> 10:24.990
Sometime today.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.930
- Worst. Day. Ever.

10:33.099 --> 10:36.634
- "Nice boys never say
people eat insects."

10:36.669 --> 10:39.871
- I beg your pardon?
- It's a mnemonic device.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.906
It helps you remember things.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.908
That's, uh, the Maritimes:

10:43.943 --> 10:47.512
New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
PEI. Nice boys--

10:47.547 --> 10:51.349
- Diana, could you please tell Gilbert
Blythe that I don't need his help?

10:51.384 --> 10:54.519
- Why don't you just tell me
yourself? I'm right here.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.321
- I suppose I just did.

10:57.356 --> 10:59.457
- Mnemonics is spelled
with an M.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.428
Not that you need my help
or anything.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.230
Have a good weekend.
(chuckling)

11:06.265 --> 11:08.133
- You, too.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.738
Sorry.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.607
(Anne sighing)

11:29.489 --> 11:31.456
- Afternoon, Anne.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.292
- Yes, I'm aware
that it's the afternoon.

11:34.327 --> 11:37.095
- I beg your pardon?
- Why doesn't anyone say what they mean?

11:37.130 --> 11:40.164
How about: Oh, hello, are you still
having the world's lousiest day?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.733
Why, yes, thank you, I am!

11:41.768 --> 11:43.634
- I'll thank you to mind
your manners.

11:43.669 --> 11:46.204
- What does that even mean?!

11:48.007 --> 11:50.441
- Did you have a chance
to talk things over with Diana?

11:50.476 --> 11:54.812
- I talk to Diana every day,
so obviously I did!

11:54.847 --> 11:56.514
Argh!

11:59.685 --> 12:01.286
(sighing)

12:08.661 --> 12:10.995
- At least finish your milk,
Anne.

12:12.331 --> 12:14.632
- Nothing appeals to me,
Marilla.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.105
I don't feel very well.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.207
Since it's Saturday,
would it be all right

12:23.242 --> 12:25.643
if I go back to bed
for a little while?

12:25.678 --> 12:27.478
- Yes, that's fine.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.014
I'll be leaving
for Rachel's soon.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.619
- Growing up
is certainly a trial by fire.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.088
- Since you are indeed
growing up,

12:37.123 --> 12:41.659
if you'd like to invite Diana
for tea today, you may.

12:41.694 --> 12:46.164
- Tea?! With Diana as my guest?!

12:46.199 --> 12:48.833
- Only if you're up to it.
- Oh, Marilla!

12:48.868 --> 12:51.502
You are able
to imagine things after all,

12:51.537 --> 12:54.906
or else you'd never have understood
how I've longed for this very thing.

12:54.941 --> 12:59.877
A grown-up tea is one of my
highest ideals of earthly bliss!

12:59.912 --> 13:01.479
Oh...

13:01.514 --> 13:03.548
But I have nothing to wear!

13:03.583 --> 13:06.517
- You have
two perfectly good dresses.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.387
- They won't do for tea without
puff sleeves! Matthew, tell her!

13:09.422 --> 13:12.723
- She's been dreaming of those
since the day we met.

13:12.758 --> 13:16.727
- Since well before! Could you add
puff sleeves to my grey dress?

13:16.762 --> 13:18.563
- I've never heard
such foolishness.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.299
- But it wouldn't take too long.
Please, Marilla, please?

13:21.334 --> 13:25.269
I'm the only girl without them!
- Do you want tea today or not?

13:25.304 --> 13:26.938
- I do.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.040
I do! I'm sorry.
I'll try to stop longing

13:29.075 --> 13:31.642
for things I can never have.
I promise I'll try harder.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.245
- You can open this little yellow
crock of cherry preserves,

13:34.280 --> 13:37.915
and you can cut some fruitcake and
have some of the cookies and snaps.

13:37.950 --> 13:41.919
- I can just imagine pouring out the tea
and asking Diana if she takes sugar.

13:41.954 --> 13:46.424
I know she doesn't, of course, but
I'll ask her just as if I didn't know.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.659
May we sit in the parlour?
- You may.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.495
And you may have some of the
raspberry cordial, as well.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.599
- Oh, thank you! I must get
dressed and run and ask Diana!

13:54.634 --> 13:57.768
It might turn out that I like
being a grownup after all!

13:57.803 --> 13:59.637
- Don't overexert yourself.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.543
- Oh! Matthew!

14:05.578 --> 14:09.046
- Oh, there, uh,
seemed to be a... a draft.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.583
- I'm having Diana to tea!
(giggling)

14:12.919 --> 14:15.119
I'm having Diana to tea!
To tea, tea!

14:15.154 --> 14:16.788
(humming)

14:20.893 --> 14:23.794
- I'll be gone most of the day.

14:23.829 --> 14:27.765
- What would you like me to do?
- Whatever needs doing.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.402
You let Miss Cuthbert know...
I've gone to Carmody.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.304
Head out to the gate.
- Yes, sir.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.642
(horse nickering)

15:06.639 --> 15:09.507
(sighing) - Don't these
just look scrumptious.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.378
Would you care for some sugar? I'm ever
so delighted that you could attend.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.549
- Must be Saturday.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.553
Nice to have you here, son.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.924
Will you... read my favourite?

15:28.794 --> 15:30.661
<i>(Gilbert):</i>
<i>"Afoot and lighthearted</i>

15:30.696 --> 15:33.164
<i>I take to the open road.</i>

15:33.199 --> 15:34.999
<i>Healthy, free,</i>

15:35.034 --> 15:37.335
<i>the world before me,</i>

15:37.370 --> 15:40.371
<i>the long brown path</i>
<i>before me</i>

15:40.406 --> 15:42.907
<i>leading wherever I choose."</i>

16:21.847 --> 16:23.748
- Good day, sir.
May I assist you?

16:25.718 --> 16:28.019
- No. No, uh, no.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.221
Well, I...

16:32.925 --> 16:34.725
Not now.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.661
(bells dinging)

16:48.407 --> 16:51.075
- Mr. Cuthbert, isn't it? Ah!
- Yes.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.644
- We haven't seen you
for a while.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.679
What can we get for you today?

16:55.714 --> 16:57.982
- We've got a special price
on winter boots.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.618
Big selection. Come in, come in.
- Well, I, uh...

17:04.757 --> 17:06.424
-<i> Won't you please come in?</i>

17:08.928 --> 17:11.395
May I take your hat and coat?

17:11.430 --> 17:12.963
- Why, thank you.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.599
- I trust your family is well?

17:15.634 --> 17:17.935
- Quite well, thank you kindly.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.778
- Your table is exquisite!

17:27.780 --> 17:29.580
- How nice of you to say.

17:29.615 --> 17:34.018
Won't you please sit down whilst I set
the tea to steep and fetch the cordial?

17:34.053 --> 17:37.121
There are ever so many responsibilities
when one is hosting company.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.463
Raspberry cordial,

17:45.498 --> 17:47.331
where are you?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.387
(muttering)

18:13.492 --> 18:15.493
(background chatter)

18:23.836 --> 18:25.436
(bells dinging)

18:25.471 --> 18:27.872
- You're back.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.808
Surely there's something
I can help you with.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.010
- Yes. I...

18:35.481 --> 18:38.582
- Would you like to look at dress styles?
- I, uh, I...

18:38.617 --> 18:40.918
- We have ever so many
to choose from.

18:40.953 --> 18:45.189
We make all the latest fashions just
as if they're straight from Paris.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.057
(stammering)

18:47.092 --> 18:50.561
- Matthew Cuthbert,
as I live and breathe.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.070
- Uh, Jeannie?

19:08.480 --> 19:12.483
- And we very much hope it won't
be a harsh winter this year.

19:12.518 --> 19:15.152
- Winter can indeed be savage.

19:15.187 --> 19:17.321
Please, allow me.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.356
- You're too kind.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.892
- I love bright-red drinks,
don't you?

19:21.927 --> 19:25.162
They taste twice as good
as any other colour.

19:25.197 --> 19:28.032
-<i> Je vous remercie</i>
<i>de vos belles manières.</i>

19:28.067 --> 19:29.967
- That's French!

19:30.002 --> 19:31.702
You speak French?!

19:31.737 --> 19:33.804
-<i> Oui, je parle français,</i>
<i>couramment.</i>

19:33.839 --> 19:37.541
- Could there be anything more perfect
than you speaking a romance language?

19:37.576 --> 19:39.577
My two favorite things
together.

19:40.579 --> 19:44.114
(giggling) - Mother plans to send
me to finishing school in France.

19:44.149 --> 19:48.052
- Really? Will you take me
with you? You have to take me!

19:48.087 --> 19:50.855
-<i> Si vous m'en versez</i>
<i>un peu plus.</i>

19:52.458 --> 19:54.292
-<i> Oui...</i>
(laughter)

19:56.629 --> 19:59.530
This cordial seems
to be a different cordial

19:59.565 --> 20:03.601
from the cordial we toasted with
when I became a Cuthbert,

20:03.636 --> 20:05.469
but I believe I like it better.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.973
- I could drink this
for the rest of my life.

20:09.008 --> 20:12.376
- I'm going to make...
a proclamation.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.778
(laughter)

20:14.813 --> 20:16.447
I've decided...

20:16.482 --> 20:18.515
that I love...

20:18.550 --> 20:20.618
being a woman.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.955
There is so much
to look forward to

20:24.990 --> 20:27.157
when we're even older!

20:27.192 --> 20:29.460
- Bosoms!!
(laughter)

20:30.963 --> 20:33.831
- We get to wear corsets.
- Because we'll have bosoms!

20:33.866 --> 20:35.332
(laughter)

20:35.367 --> 20:38.469
- Isn't it wonderful
how we agree on everything?

20:38.504 --> 20:40.871
- Isn't it wonderful
to be so grown up?

20:44.710 --> 20:47.011
- Oh, no.
- Hmm?

20:47.046 --> 20:48.679
- I forgot the tea.

20:50.783 --> 20:53.718
(laughter)
-<i> You haven't told me her name.</i>

20:53.753 --> 20:56.254
- It's Anne.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.790
With an E.
- Lovely.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.792
What does she look like?

21:00.827 --> 21:03.895
- Well, uh... her hair is red.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.497
She doesn't care for it,

21:06.532 --> 21:09.634
but I think it's just fine.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.402
- Does she have
a favorite colour?

21:11.437 --> 21:15.606
- Oh, um, I couldn't say that...
for certain.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.811
But... she loves trees
and flowers and such.

21:19.846 --> 21:24.782
She's got a lot
of romantic notions about life.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.852
- So maybe something with a
little flounce? Ruffles perhaps?

21:27.887 --> 21:33.624
- And she's got a longing
for a certain type of sleeve.

21:33.659 --> 21:35.493
With, um...

21:39.332 --> 21:42.133
...with air... on the sides...

21:42.168 --> 21:43.935
- Puff sleeves?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.803
<i>De rigueur.</i>

21:45.838 --> 21:47.972
- Oh, and, uh, I...

21:48.007 --> 21:49.807
I brought this...

21:49.842 --> 21:52.343
- Oh.
- Sorry, that's...

21:54.180 --> 21:56.181
That's for the... the boots.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.954
So this is her size...

22:02.989 --> 22:05.990
with a little room for growing.

22:09.162 --> 22:12.864
- I can see why she's longing
for the latest fashions.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.334
Marilla was always
a very practical person.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.904
I'll use this as a pattern
for the size,

22:19.939 --> 22:21.973
but everything else
will be<i> au courant.</i>

22:22.008 --> 22:24.242
Vivienne?

22:24.277 --> 22:26.811
Please take down
these measurements.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.946
Thank you, dear.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.482
- I'm not worried
about the cost.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.485
Just as long as she likes it.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.121
- This dress
will be her dream come true.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.724
And I'll give you
the "old friend" discount.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.392
- That's, uh...

22:42.728 --> 22:45.363
That's very kind of you,
Jeannie.

22:46.566 --> 22:50.068
- Matthew... would you like
to stay for tea?

22:51.571 --> 22:53.871
It will be a few minutes
to measure the dress.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.007
- Oh, I... I don't know.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.309
- I live right upstairs,
just above the shop.

22:58.344 --> 23:03.148
I'd hate to see you ride all the way
back to Avonlea without fortification.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.355
- All right, then. Much obliged.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.558
(giggling)

23:20.566 --> 23:22.033
- Ready?

23:22.068 --> 23:24.101
One...

23:24.136 --> 23:25.870
two...

23:25.905 --> 23:27.672
(both): Three!!

23:29.709 --> 23:32.176
- She's a real...
bright little thing.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.745
She talks a mile a minute.

23:34.780 --> 23:38.216
Always something interesting
to say.

23:38.251 --> 23:41.719
- So you barely have to say
a word. Must be heaven.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.088
(both chuckling)

23:45.124 --> 23:46.925
But you make yourself known.

23:57.637 --> 24:01.239
You once left a little something
on my desk at school.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.244
- Did I?

24:06.279 --> 24:07.979
- You don't remember?

24:10.082 --> 24:12.583
<i>(children's voices echoing)</i>

24:12.618 --> 24:15.353
(indistinct chatter)

24:18.524 --> 24:21.759
- Jeannie, will you teach me that
pretty cross-stitch after school?

24:21.794 --> 24:24.796
- It's called a feather stitch.
And of course I will.

25:06.672 --> 25:10.108
Anyone else would've made
a show of giving it to me.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.445
You knew I collected buttons.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.649
I told you when
you walked me home that time.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.922
It wasn't long after...

25:24.957 --> 25:27.024
that you left school.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.527
I was worried about you.

25:33.366 --> 25:37.035
We were all so sorry
when your brother passed away.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.879
- Um...

25:48.881 --> 25:51.382
Yeah. I'd best be on my way.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.219
- Of course.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.222
Uh... Anne...

25:58.257 --> 26:01.359
Anne's dress should be ready
in about a week.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.529
- Very kind of you, Jeannie.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.166
- It was, uh...
It was good to see you.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.703
I... I look forward
to seeing you then.

26:20.379 --> 26:21.879
(sighing)

26:51.777 --> 26:53.978
(sighing)
- This will feed a small army.

26:54.013 --> 26:57.681
- So this should be just enough
for my extended family.

26:57.716 --> 27:01.118
- How ever did you ever manage
to have ten children?

27:01.153 --> 27:03.921
You were expecting
for at least two decades.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.656
- Don't remind me.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.391
Oh, hello, dear.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.160
- Hello.

27:09.195 --> 27:12.630
- I hope you're not begging tea.
- No, no. I was just, uh--

27:12.665 --> 27:15.266
- Because we're up to our
britches, aren't we, Marilla?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.737
Would you like a little lick?

27:19.772 --> 27:21.939
- Ooh, I could fancy that, yes.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.445
Mm.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.115
(chuckling)

27:32.618 --> 27:35.419
- Off you go. Fend for yourself.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.288
(husband humming)

27:41.494 --> 27:44.662
At this point, it's all about
managing expectations.

27:46.499 --> 27:50.468
You know, I could do with a spot
of tea now that it's come up. You?

27:50.503 --> 27:53.171
- Please.
I need a little bracing.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.243
- How do suppose Anne is faring
with her grownup ladies' tea?

27:59.278 --> 28:01.579
- I'm sure
it's a very dignified affair.

28:01.614 --> 28:03.247
(Rachel laughing)

28:03.282 --> 28:05.016
(music)

28:06.285 --> 28:09.353
- Jerry,
hurry and hitch up the buggy,

28:09.388 --> 28:12.957
or I shall be late for the ball!

28:12.992 --> 28:14.925
(laughter)

28:14.960 --> 28:18.462
- Jerry, fetch me some rose water
before I have a fainting spell!

28:18.497 --> 28:20.331
(laughter)
(waltz music)

28:23.002 --> 28:25.169
(exclamations)

28:28.507 --> 28:30.174
(laughter)

28:31.210 --> 28:33.978
(singing out of tune):
♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪

28:34.013 --> 28:36.814
♪ Wake unto me ♪
♪ Dream... ♪

28:36.849 --> 28:41.318
♪ Starlight and dewdrops

28:41.353 --> 28:46.524
♪ Sounds of the rude world

28:46.559 --> 28:50.861

28:50.896 --> 28:52.563
(laughter)

28:56.068 --> 28:57.568
- Mother!

29:11.350 --> 29:14.718
- As you can see,
this is a disgraceful scene.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.353
- My word, Anne,

29:16.388 --> 29:19.090
you certainly have a genius
for getting into trouble.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.826
I didn't even know I had any
currant wine left in the house.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.196
- I can't imagine why you
had any in the first place.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.064
- It was for medicinal
purposes.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.600
But when the minister
disapproved,

29:29.635 --> 29:32.102
I threw the remainder away
long ago.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.671
Or so I thought.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.839
- Your... charge...

29:35.874 --> 29:38.342
is a bad influence
on my daughter.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.712
- Anne made an honest mistake.
I'm to blame.

29:41.747 --> 29:44.682
- This is the last time my Diana
will ever set foot in this house.

29:44.717 --> 29:48.352
- Please, Mrs. Barry, I didn't
mean to set Diana drunk!

29:48.387 --> 29:51.488
- You are not a fit little girl
for Diana to associate with.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.424
- But it wasn't on purpose!

29:53.459 --> 29:56.794
- Moreover, the girls are not
to sit together at school.

29:57.796 --> 30:01.632
They are not to fraternize
in any manner at any time.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.468
- I don't disagree
that the girls

30:04.503 --> 30:07.004
should be punished
for all that has transpired.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.907
Might I suggest
a duration of two weeks?

30:09.942 --> 30:12.843
- I must preserve my Diana
from the contaminations

30:12.878 --> 30:15.446
of further intimacy
with such a child!

30:15.481 --> 30:16.981
My judgment is final!

30:17.016 --> 30:20.618
Come along, Diana.
- Please, Mrs. Barry, please!

30:20.653 --> 30:23.787
- Diana, come along!
- Please, Mother, please!

30:23.822 --> 30:25.489
- Out!

30:25.524 --> 30:27.358
(crying)

30:43.909 --> 30:45.710
(sobbing)

31:04.697 --> 31:06.364
(owl hooting)

31:13.706 --> 31:16.207
(Marilla sighing)
- It's been a trying day.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.346
What on earth possessed you
to buy all those boots?

31:24.550 --> 31:26.684
That was a frivolous expense.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.886
They'll have to go back.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.389
(owl hooting)

31:32.424 --> 31:34.759
- Do you ever think...

31:35.594 --> 31:37.161
...about Michael?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.000
- Yes.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.238
- So much
would've been different...

31:48.273 --> 31:49.873
if he hadn't--

31:49.908 --> 31:51.442
- Yes.

31:53.779 --> 31:55.279
Good night.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.609
(door creaking)

32:42.661 --> 32:44.495
Poor little soul.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.974
- Not going to school today?

33:32.545 --> 33:35.079
- I feel like I should...

33:35.114 --> 33:36.648
just stay close.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.053
(wind whistling)

33:46.092 --> 33:48.292
(crows cawing)

33:48.327 --> 33:50.261
(loud chatter)

33:55.001 --> 33:57.402
- You are not to fraternize

33:57.437 --> 33:59.404
or exert undue influence.

33:59.439 --> 34:02.073
Ruby, switch places with Anne.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.042
(all exclaiming)

34:12.285 --> 34:14.386
(quiet background chatter)

34:32.271 --> 34:34.272
- Will your mother never relent?

34:34.307 --> 34:36.908
- I've cried and cried
and told her over and over again

34:36.943 --> 34:39.310
that it wasn't your fault.
But it isn't any use.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.715
- So this is an eternal
farewell?

34:45.284 --> 34:49.153
Then we must speak - the most pathetic
language that we can think of.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.888
- With thees and thous?

34:50.923 --> 34:54.793
- That way we will never forget
the pathos of this moment.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.733
Oh, Diana...

35:01.768 --> 35:04.569
wilt thou promise faithfully

35:04.604 --> 35:08.039
never to forget me,
the friend of your youth?

35:08.074 --> 35:10.575
- I'll never have
another bosom friend.

35:10.610 --> 35:12.477
I don't want to.

35:13.613 --> 35:17.381
I could never love anyone
as I love you, Anne. Thou.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.250
- Wait.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.119
You love me?

35:22.288 --> 35:25.790
- Of course I do.
Why don't you know that?

35:25.825 --> 35:28.359
- Oh, I thought you liked me,
of course,

35:28.394 --> 35:30.661
but I never hoped you loved me.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.197
- I love you devotedly, Anne.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.668
- And I will always love thee,
Diana.

35:37.837 --> 35:39.470
In the years to come,

35:39.505 --> 35:43.341
your memory will shine
like a star over my lonely life.

35:46.345 --> 35:50.148
Let us offer each other
locks of our hair...

35:50.183 --> 35:51.983
to treasure evermore.

35:52.018 --> 35:53.685
(sniffling)

36:08.501 --> 36:13.504
I bestow upon thou
this symbol of my enduring love.

36:13.539 --> 36:17.342
- Fare thee well,
dearest Anne of Green Gables.

36:18.811 --> 36:22.313
Henceforth we must be as
strangers living side by side.

36:31.324 --> 36:33.191
(school bell ringing)

36:34.293 --> 36:36.060
(boys shouting)

36:39.732 --> 36:41.799
- Anne.
(fingers snapping)

36:41.834 --> 36:43.401
Take these lessons
to Gilbert Blythe.

36:43.436 --> 36:45.269
He'll be missing class
for a time,

36:45.304 --> 36:47.705
and I don't want him
falling too far behind.

36:47.740 --> 36:49.607
He's my best student.

36:50.910 --> 36:53.544
- Why is he missing class?
- That is none of your concern.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.246
Now hurry along.

36:56.415 --> 36:57.916
Scat!

37:02.021 --> 37:03.688
(Anne sighing)

37:15.001 --> 37:17.402
- Why does everything happen
to me?

37:20.740 --> 37:22.373
Gilbert?!

37:22.408 --> 37:24.208
(knocking)

37:24.243 --> 37:26.077
Gilbert Blythe!

37:29.415 --> 37:32.083
(sighing)
Life is so unfair.

37:38.925 --> 37:40.925
Finally.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.094
(panting)

37:43.129 --> 37:44.863
- Sorry to make you wait.

37:46.299 --> 37:47.865
Gilbert...

37:47.900 --> 37:50.802
is out back chopping wood.

37:52.805 --> 37:54.806
What wonderful red hair.

37:56.309 --> 37:58.643
You're the Cuthbert's
new charge, aren't you?

37:58.678 --> 38:00.111
- Yes.

38:00.146 --> 38:02.146
- I've heard nice things
about you.

38:02.181 --> 38:04.449
And how is Marilla?
Still feisty, I hope?

38:06.252 --> 38:08.319
- Dad, what are you doing?

38:08.354 --> 38:10.021
You shouldn't be walking!

38:10.056 --> 38:12.056
- My son worries too much.

38:12.091 --> 38:15.426
It seems this young lady
has urgent business. With you.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.094
I'll go inside now.

38:17.129 --> 38:18.763
- I'll fetch your chair.

38:18.798 --> 38:21.432
- I'll go on my own,
thank you, son.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.434
It was nice to meet you.

38:23.469 --> 38:25.736
Give my kind regards to Marilla.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.239
- I will. Of course, Mr. Blythe.

38:33.813 --> 38:36.280
- Those for me?

38:36.315 --> 38:37.815
- Uh... heh.

38:41.988 --> 38:45.356
Well, uh, it's kind of you
to bring them by.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.959
- Mr. Phillips doesn't want you
falling behind.

38:47.994 --> 38:49.827
- I don't either.

38:49.862 --> 38:52.096
If you're going to beat me
in class,

38:52.131 --> 38:54.666
I want you to do it
fair and square.

38:56.035 --> 38:57.601
- Yes. Exactly.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.038
- Um... thank you.

39:00.973 --> 39:02.440
See you.

39:15.488 --> 39:17.488
(soft violin music)

39:28.701 --> 39:30.835
- There. Finished.
(laughing)

39:30.870 --> 39:32.737
- That was fast.

39:32.772 --> 39:34.572
Only took you a week.

39:34.607 --> 39:38.075
- I wanted to make it quickly
so Diana doesn't forget me.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.077
I'm happy to report

39:40.112 --> 39:43.080
that my flowering time
is finally over.

39:43.115 --> 39:46.517
I feel much older and wiser
than before.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.853
And I won't be emotional
next time.

39:48.888 --> 39:52.724
I've come to realize there are
far bigger worries in the world.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.426
(chuckling)

39:56.896 --> 40:01.098
- So buy the dress
after you return the boots,

40:01.133 --> 40:04.402
but I'm hoping
this will be enough.

40:04.437 --> 40:09.240
Oh, and I must've picked this up
by mistake... at the dress shop.

40:09.275 --> 40:12.543
Please, just... you return that
to Miss Jeannie.

40:19.318 --> 40:23.087
- I hope Mr. Cuthbert's well?
- Yes, madame, he's quite well.

40:23.122 --> 40:24.755
- I'm glad.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.625
Please tell him I'm sorry
not to have seen him today.

40:27.660 --> 40:29.293
- Yes, madame.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.797
Oh, I almost forgot.

40:32.832 --> 40:36.034
Mr. Cuthbert said
I'm to give you this.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.507
<i>Au revoir!</i>

40:56.522 --> 40:58.689
- Oh, hello, Matthew.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.171
Huh.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.249
Thank you.

42:30.249 --> 42:33.417
- You've gone
and spoiled the child, Matthew.

42:34.587 --> 42:36.821
- She's not a child anymore.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.990
- Can we be a little bit late
for church

42:40.025 --> 42:41.759
so everyone can see me
walking in?

42:44.296 --> 42:45.763
- Matthew Cuthbert,

42:45.798 --> 42:48.599
you're missing a button
from your best Sunday shirt.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.601
- I'm fine...

42:50.636 --> 42:52.737
like this, Marilla.

42:54.139 --> 42:57.274
Well, let's go along, then.

42:57.309 --> 42:59.109
(clearing throat)

42:59.144 --> 43:01.746
If you please... miss.

43:07.253 --> 43:09.086
(Anne sighing)

44:02.141 --> 44:04.108
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal

44:04.143 --> 44:06.110
(grunting)
- Ah!
