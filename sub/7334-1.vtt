02:16.209 --> 02:17.709
Back up a bit

02:24.626 --> 02:25.751
Parking?

02:26.751 --> 02:28.626
It's alright. We're police

02:29.167 --> 02:32.751
Are all the cars' owners in the karaoke?

02:32.834 --> 02:36.917
Yes. The white car belongs to an executive

02:37.001 --> 02:37.876
And this one?

02:37.959 --> 02:41.542
This belongs to the actor in...

02:41.626 --> 02:45.667
A big movie star anyway. What happened?

02:45.751 --> 02:47.126
Nothing. Just asking

02:47.501 --> 02:49.167
Your wife's picking you up again?

02:49.292 --> 02:51.417
Not this time. Had a fight

02:51.584 --> 02:53.334
Pretty big one too

02:53.751 --> 02:55.792
We're waiting to see who blinks first

02:55.876 --> 02:58.209
Mr. Wu, I'd like a picture

02:58.459 --> 03:00.167
No problem

03:01.834 --> 03:03.251
1,2,3

03:03.626 --> 03:08.084
Enough. Enough. Thanks

03:08.167 --> 03:08.767
Sorry about that

03:08.917 --> 03:11.292
We'll be here forever if you take pictures
with all of them

03:11.376 --> 03:13.042
Please buy some flowers

03:13.542 --> 03:14.751
They're out

03:16.001 --> 03:19.126
Let me. Give him the flowers

03:20.501 --> 03:22.334
Now go home and do your homework

03:22.417 --> 03:25.292
For your wife? I knew you'd blink first

03:25.501 --> 03:27.542
Why give them to me?
- You paid! For your girlfriend

03:27.626 --> 03:29.542
My girlfriend?

03:29.876 --> 03:31.501
30 RMB for two hours, sir

03:31.584 --> 03:32.917
Let me get it

03:33.001 --> 03:35.459
Excuse me, sir, can I ask you something?

03:35.542 --> 03:37.584
Is this car yours?
- Yes

03:37.834 --> 03:41.459
We're from the City Police Bureau's
Criminal Division

03:41.542 --> 03:44.459
This car was in a hit-and-run.

03:44.609 --> 03:45.501
I hope you'll cooperate

03:45.584 --> 03:47.334
Can you show us your driving license?

03:47.417 --> 03:49.042
That's impossible!

03:49.667 --> 03:52.876
I hardly drive. I'm not used to driving
on the right

03:53.501 --> 03:54.417
Did you drink?

03:54.501 --> 03:55.834
No!

03:58.001 --> 04:00.251
Is a Hong Kong driving license even legal here?

04:00.334 --> 04:03.751
Of course. I completed all the paperwork

04:03.959 --> 04:06.376
Can you show me your police ID?
- Yes

04:09.126 --> 04:13.126
We've been tracking your car for several days

04:13.917 --> 04:16.541
Days? That makes no sense

04:16.625 --> 04:18.584
Isn't this under the jurisdiction
of the traffic police?

04:18.666 --> 04:22.041
Which section of the Police Bureau
are you from again?

04:22.125 --> 04:23.821
If you have questions,

04:23.971 --> 04:25.667
ask them at the station

04:25.751 --> 04:27.459
It's clear, right?

04:27.542 --> 04:31.042
But right now I need your cooperation, okay?

04:31.126 --> 04:33.542
I don't understand your procedures.

04:33.692 --> 04:35.084
Let me call 110

04:35.167 --> 04:37.251
You mean you're not willing to cooperate?

04:37.334 --> 04:39.709
You think you deserve
special treatment? Cuff him!

04:39.792 --> 04:42.251
What did you say?
- Say what?

04:42.667 --> 04:45.167
What are you doing? Freeze

04:46.251 --> 04:47.792
How can the police...

04:47.876 --> 04:50.292
You're obstructing police business.
Shut your mouth!

04:50.376 --> 04:52.126
One more word and <i>I'll</i> arrest you. Understand?

04:52.209 --> 04:53.876
How can the police...?

04:55.709 --> 04:56.834
Take him away!

04:58.417 --> 04:59.251
Don't move!

05:02.126 --> 05:06.417
We're bringing him in. We can verify there

05:09.876 --> 05:11.751
You're not police

05:18.667 --> 05:20.167
You're kidnapping me

05:22.251 --> 05:25.292
Would you believe me if I denied it?

05:41.584 --> 05:45.917
That's pretty much what happened

05:46.126 --> 05:48.001
Even if it went down differently,

05:49.876 --> 05:51.292
my version is now the official one

05:51.376 --> 05:53.709
So you were impersonating a police officer?

05:53.792 --> 05:56.626
Why not? Mr. Wu impersonated a cop too...

05:56.876 --> 05:58.917
What movie was it?

05:59.001 --> 06:02.417
It's not the same.
Where are you keeping Mr. Wu?

06:02.626 --> 06:03.459
No idea

06:03.542 --> 06:05.209
You think this is funny?
- Not especially

06:05.292 --> 06:06.626
Then stop talking nonsense!

06:06.709 --> 06:07.751
Zhang, you're not as smart as you think

06:07.834 --> 06:10.209
If you're so smart, find him yourself
- Cocky much?

06:10.292 --> 06:12.667
Me? You are! Hurry up and beat me!

06:12.751 --> 06:14.751
You think you're special.
But we caught you, didn't we?

06:14.834 --> 06:16.834
You deserve a beating for what you did!

06:16.917 --> 06:18.126
Stop jabbering and beat me then!

06:18.209 --> 06:20.834
Zhang, we know you're not some petty thief

06:21.417 --> 06:24.667
You're smart. Smart people
do what's best for themselves

06:37.542 --> 06:41.459
First, tell me how you found me

06:54.834 --> 06:57.876
Chief, he keeps looking at the clock

06:58.709 --> 07:00.434
We're running out of time.

07:00.584 --> 07:02.667
But Mr. Wu should still be alive

07:02.751 --> 07:03.834
He's still alive, right?

07:04.501 --> 07:07.501
Yep
- Alive or dead makes all the difference

07:07.584 --> 07:09.084
There's your opportunity. Think it through

07:09.167 --> 07:10.642
In these cases,

07:10.792 --> 07:12.876
his partners will be waiting for him
to Contact them

07:12.959 --> 07:14.876
He never received any calls on his phone

07:15.251 --> 07:17.292
He only made calls. We switched it off

07:17.376 --> 07:19.542
They must have agreed on a deadline

07:19.751 --> 07:23.334
Since we're all here,
let's get down to business

07:24.209 --> 07:27.042
You're accomplices will wait until when?

07:31.001 --> 07:31.792
PM

07:32.042 --> 07:34.001
There's 90 minutes left. What happens then?

07:35.876 --> 07:36.876
We follow the rules

07:36.959 --> 07:38.417
What rules? Talk!

07:38.542 --> 07:39.542
Execution

07:39.667 --> 07:41.209
That's not a rule!

07:41.292 --> 07:44.042
I have my own rulebook

07:44.126 --> 07:45.917
I do how I please

07:46.001 --> 07:48.834
I decide who lives and dies

07:48.917 --> 07:50.542
Who do you think you are?

07:50.626 --> 07:52.084
So you're going to keep fighting us?

07:52.234 --> 07:53.459
For now you can only...

07:53.542 --> 07:55.142
I have to consider

07:55.292 --> 07:58.042
whether I still have any hope

07:58.126 --> 07:59.959
Your only hope is to make amends
for your crimes

08:00.042 --> 08:01.876
Everything Zhang had with him is here

08:05.292 --> 08:07.084
They were on him or in his car

08:07.376 --> 08:10.209
Can I name one condition?

08:10.376 --> 08:11.376
Go ahead

08:11.959 --> 08:14.876
If I help save Mr. Wu,

08:15.667 --> 08:16.792
then you'll let me go

08:18.459 --> 08:20.584
You're not taking your situation seriously

08:20.834 --> 08:23.751
I am. But this is what's on my mind

08:23.834 --> 08:25.709
We live together or die together

08:25.792 --> 08:27.792
I thought you were smarter

08:27.876 --> 08:31.292
I am. I was as good as dead when I was caught

08:32.333 --> 08:35.208
I'm gonna die, right? I'm a dead man for sure

08:35.292 --> 08:38.626
The weapons alone add up
to several death sentences

08:44.167 --> 08:47.251
There were three firearms in his car's trunk

08:47.751 --> 08:51.584
Two guns and a grenade on his person

08:52.042 --> 08:54.459
We found another gun at his girlfriend's place

08:54.626 --> 08:58.292
Kidnapping is too easy.
He should secure the Diaoyu Islands!

09:01.209 --> 09:03.667
Over 200 bullets of different Calibers

09:03.959 --> 09:04.834
Check them out!

09:06.209 --> 09:07.251
5 bullets in the clip

09:08.626 --> 09:09.542
1 bullet in the gun

09:09.626 --> 09:10.792
No bullets in the revolver

09:11.959 --> 09:13.209
9 bullets in the clip and 1 in the gun

09:13.292 --> 09:15.292
29 bullets in the AK clip and 1 in the gun

09:16.042 --> 09:18.709
Frankly, you're one capable guy

09:19.376 --> 09:20.667
Where did you learn this stuff?

09:22.209 --> 09:24.459
If I said from Hollywood movies,
would you believe me?

09:24.542 --> 09:26.501
Why not from the Black Cat Detective animation?

09:27.792 --> 09:29.059
'I'm joking!
- Enough!

09:29.209 --> 09:31.751
The time you're wasting is your own.
You get that?

09:31.834 --> 09:34.667
The sooner the hostage is released,
the better for you. Understand?

09:34.834 --> 09:38.126
Zhang, we can't avoid the subject
of Mr. Wu tonight

09:38.209 --> 09:39.126
Let's get back to him

09:39.709 --> 09:42.501
Did he fight back in the car
after you kidnapped him?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.959
You're a useless driver!

09:57.667 --> 09:59.917
Am I your kidnapping target?

10:01.376 --> 10:04.042
Mr. Wu, just blame it on bad luck

10:04.667 --> 10:09.167
How could we not kidnap a movie star
right in front of us?

10:13.792 --> 10:15.042
How long was the drive?

10:15.126 --> 10:17.126
It was about...

10:18.959 --> 10:20.501
Stop trying to trick me

10:20.584 --> 10:23.709
I told you my conditions. Give it some thought

10:24.209 --> 10:25.626
Let's change the subject

10:26.126 --> 10:28.667
Your guns? Quite a collection!

10:28.751 --> 10:31.501
Where did you get them? Fill me in

10:47.251 --> 10:50.459
He says he doesn't know your buddy

10:52.584 --> 10:54.017
But they know money.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.709
I'm paying for the next batch too

10:59.459 --> 11:00.251
What's wrong?

11:02.959 --> 11:04.459
They don't want to sell to you
- Why?

11:06.209 --> 11:07.834
They say you look like a cop

11:09.501 --> 11:10.959
Do I?

11:11.042 --> 11:13.542
You are shit

11:13.626 --> 11:15.501
Stop provoking. Carry on!

11:15.917 --> 11:17.042
What are they saying?

11:17.959 --> 11:19.334
That we're both cops

11:24.667 --> 11:26.584
Explain that we're not cops

11:30.251 --> 11:31.792
How do you say "friend" in Russian?

11:54.542 --> 11:57.792
He won't buy this many firearms
just for a kidnapping

11:58.126 --> 12:00.167
Why did you secure so many weapons?

12:00.751 --> 12:02.751
Can't I keep some secrets?

12:02.959 --> 12:05.196
Thought I'd make history.

12:05.346 --> 12:07.584
Too bad I missed my chance

12:07.667 --> 12:12.959
Your role in history will only be that
of a rotting corpse! Understand?

12:16.167 --> 12:18.126
Can you guess how we found you?

12:18.209 --> 12:19.917
I was careless. The women...

12:20.376 --> 12:23.084
Five women including the one today.

12:23.234 --> 12:24.459
Can you handle so many?

12:27.126 --> 12:28.542
So you know everything!

12:29.042 --> 12:30.384
The dumplings they ordered.

12:30.534 --> 12:31.876
Eat them while they're hot

12:32.251 --> 12:33.376
Thanks

12:33.584 --> 12:35.459
Dig in. We have more

12:35.709 --> 12:37.501
A movie star is too high profile a target

12:37.917 --> 12:38.792
So you regret it?

12:38.876 --> 12:41.292
Even millionaires have cash flow problems

12:41.376 --> 12:44.167
We'd have abducted another ordinary guy
if we'd known

12:47.126 --> 12:50.292
Another ordinary guy? What do you mean?

12:50.417 --> 12:52.917
He has other operations going on

12:53.001 --> 12:56.292
I told you. I kidnapped only one person.
That's Mr. Wu

12:56.376 --> 12:57.376
Let's cut the chase

12:57.459 --> 12:58.542
I'm telling nothing but the truth

12:58.626 --> 12:59.834
The truth?

13:00.126 --> 13:02.292
We can't talk if you're not
going to be straight

13:02.376 --> 13:04.584
Zhang, you've already lost

13:04.751 --> 13:09.417
There's no point in continuing to fight with us

13:09.751 --> 13:11.417
You still have some bargaining chips,
don't you?

13:11.751 --> 13:13.251
Don't look down. Look at me

13:14.876 --> 13:16.042
What are your bargaining chips?

13:18.334 --> 13:20.376
A person
- Better be still breathing

13:20.792 --> 13:24.042
If something happens to the captive,
what are you left with?

13:24.417 --> 13:26.584
Your words won't help you. Understand?

13:27.292 --> 13:29.167
Yes
- You have to see your situation clearly

13:29.709 --> 13:33.792
If your conditions are reasonable,

13:33.942 --> 13:34.834
<i>I'll</i> help you

13:35.376 --> 13:38.084
You're a good talker. That's good

13:39.459 --> 13:40.392
I get you

13:40.542 --> 13:44.876
One question. Is there a second hostage?

13:54.084 --> 13:55.084
Yes

14:04.584 --> 14:05.917
Stop the car

14:06.001 --> 14:08.042
This car was in a hit-and-run.

14:08.192 --> 14:09.959
Please cooperate!

14:12.084 --> 14:13.709
When was he kidnapped?

14:14.417 --> 14:15.417
Yesterday

14:15.626 --> 14:17.626
Was the crime reported?
- No

14:17.709 --> 14:19.626
We lucked out. We thought he was rich

14:19.709 --> 14:20.917
What's his name?

14:21.334 --> 14:22.667
Didn't ask

14:24.084 --> 14:25.417
What did you say?

14:25.501 --> 14:26.876
The car belongs to...

14:27.459 --> 14:29.292
Who?
- A loaner

14:29.376 --> 14:30.667
Loaner?
- I borrowed it to drive home

14:30.751 --> 14:34.209
Borrowed? Who do you think you're kidding?

14:34.542 --> 14:37.292
The owner is my sex partner.
She's dating a rich guy

14:37.376 --> 14:40.501
She's dating a rich guy,
but banging you? Is that right?

14:40.626 --> 14:42.501
Why don't you call her?

14:42.584 --> 14:43.709
I don't have her phone number

14:43.792 --> 14:45.959
She's your sex partner
but you don't know her number?

14:46.042 --> 14:48.376
You threw my phone into the car.
I don't remember the number

14:52.251 --> 14:53.542
Is he still alive?

14:53.709 --> 14:54.876
They're together

14:55.792 --> 14:57.084
Get him some dumplings

14:59.584 --> 15:01.251
"AWAKEN YOUR CONSCIENCE; ENRICH YOUR SOUL"

15:02.084 --> 15:03.792
Guo, some dumplings!

15:03.876 --> 15:07.167
Zhang, you have time and you don't

15:07.334 --> 15:09.542
Tell me where the hostage is
when you're done eating

15:09.626 --> 15:13.459
No more blathering or you go straight to jail

15:35.709 --> 15:37.959
Eat them while they're hot. Use your hands

15:39.292 --> 15:43.876
Zhang, we have to resolve this today

15:44.376 --> 15:47.959
Which of us is going to make that happen?

15:51.667 --> 15:53.126
Eat them. They're getting cold

15:56.709 --> 16:00.667
Deputy, your wife keeps calling;
she says that your son...

16:00.751 --> 16:02.209
Okay. I've got it

16:04.417 --> 16:05.792
He's about to crack

16:06.209 --> 16:09.042
He will resist to the very end

16:12.001 --> 16:13.292
Zoom in

16:18.042 --> 16:20.167
What is he mumbling. Turn up the volume

16:22.751 --> 16:24.792
How did you find me?

16:41.626 --> 16:44.084
Sit up. We're there

16:44.167 --> 16:46.667
Get off. You should know when to be quiet

16:56.042 --> 16:58.001
Any progress with the other guy?

16:58.334 --> 17:01.792
Lots of tears but no dice.

17:01.942 --> 17:03.209
How's your luck?

17:05.876 --> 17:09.041
Look at him. Recognize him?

17:11.751 --> 17:14.709
The movie guy? I know him only too well

17:21.041 --> 17:22.251
How come you kidnapped him?

17:22.334 --> 17:25.626
We just targeted that car, and he stepped out.
Who better than him?

17:25.709 --> 17:26.626
Mind your steps

17:26.709 --> 17:28.834
Was it easy?
- A piece of cake

17:28.959 --> 17:30.292
This one won't disappoint

17:30.584 --> 17:32.751
That's for sure. Big game this time

17:32.834 --> 17:34.667
A movie guy. Loaded for sure

17:34.876 --> 17:38.209
Enough. Be sensitive to other's feelings

17:39.084 --> 17:42.251
It's pretty simple.
We value money more than life

17:43.334 --> 17:47.001
A big star like you should walk around
with a bodyguard

17:49.709 --> 17:51.001
I do sometimes

17:54.667 --> 17:56.917
Do you think your friend called the cops?

18:00.334 --> 18:04.542
I made the call to check they were real cops?

18:04.626 --> 18:06.334
Are you Mr. Cheng?
- Yes, I am

18:06.417 --> 18:07.417
This is Deputy Cao

18:07.709 --> 18:08.542
Hello, Deputy

18:09.459 --> 18:10.959
Tell us what happened

18:11.334 --> 18:13.042
I was scared so I kept as far back as possible

18:13.126 --> 18:14.042
I saw everything

18:14.917 --> 18:17.876
I need the money within 24 hours

18:18.959 --> 18:20.251
In case I don't get it,

18:23.626 --> 18:25.584
let me show you the consequences

18:25.667 --> 18:29.959
Come on. Let me introduce you to a big star

18:30.042 --> 18:31.084
Recognize him?

18:33.959 --> 18:35.459
Yes

18:36.251 --> 18:38.834
I kidnapped him just yesterday

18:40.001 --> 18:41.042
What's your name?

18:42.917 --> 18:43.834
My family name's Dou

18:44.542 --> 18:45.667
Dough!

18:47.751 --> 18:52.834
Are you as half-baked as your name?

18:52.917 --> 18:56.917
I don't have patience with dishonest guys

18:57.001 --> 18:59.834
Did I get my money? Did I?

18:59.917 --> 19:02.292
I asked you again if I got the money!
- No

19:02.376 --> 19:05.376
No? Right. Now I've got to do what I've got to

19:05.459 --> 19:06.334
What time is it now?

19:07.917 --> 19:10.751
Have 24 hours passed?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.834
You tell me what else I should do

19:13.917 --> 19:17.709
I really don't have any money!

19:19.959 --> 19:21.709
What are you doing?

19:21.792 --> 19:25.751
Let me show you. Step back

19:25.834 --> 19:30.417
Stop! You can't do that

19:30.751 --> 19:34.376
Wait? I can't do what?

19:34.751 --> 19:37.334
You're not used to situations like this, right?

19:38.084 --> 19:42.626
Take him out of here and suffocate him

19:42.709 --> 19:46.042
Stop! Please listen to me!

19:54.167 --> 19:58.626
Stop? What do you mean stop?

19:59.126 --> 20:02.542
You said you value money over life, didn't you?

20:05.417 --> 20:06.584
I did

20:07.292 --> 20:08.751
I'll pay his ransom

20:17.084 --> 20:18.459
Pretty generous

20:19.959 --> 20:22.459
Real generous. What are we supposed to do now?

20:24.584 --> 20:29.167
Stop. Please. Can't you stop?

20:29.709 --> 20:32.876
This is the punishment
for not paying up within 24 hours

20:32.959 --> 20:37.209
You can't do that

20:39.417 --> 20:40.209
Stop!

20:40.292 --> 20:41.501
He said stop!

20:47.876 --> 20:52.417
You're so worked up. So worked up

20:54.542 --> 20:56.251
What's your connection to him?

20:56.667 --> 20:57.876
No connection

21:00.209 --> 21:01.876
But now we have a connection

21:03.501 --> 21:06.876
I have my conditions. You take my money

21:08.917 --> 21:10.584
He leaves with me

21:29.167 --> 21:30.292
Thank you

21:32.542 --> 21:33.584
It's okay

21:33.917 --> 21:35.084
Go take a look

21:46.834 --> 21:48.292
Right. It's the car in the middle

21:48.459 --> 21:50.334
It turns north under Changhong Bridge

21:50.417 --> 21:52.167
Show me the next intersection
- We can't

21:52.292 --> 21:53.792
How come? Why not?
- The cameras

21:53.942 --> 21:55.334
were being repaired

22:02.126 --> 22:04.251
Are you sure?
- Positive

22:04.709 --> 22:05.959
It's Zhang, right

22:06.667 --> 22:07.667
Cao

22:10.584 --> 22:12.001
Chief Li
- It's Zhang

22:12.459 --> 22:13.417
That's right

22:13.542 --> 22:15.059
I knew it.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.251
<i>I'll</i> bring Xing Feng and the others here

22:16.401 --> 22:19.001
Why did you go to the club?

22:19.917 --> 22:21.751
I'm investing in a movie

22:22.167 --> 22:24.917
He's the lead. We'd signed the contract

22:25.067 --> 22:26.017
and wanted to celebrate

22:26.167 --> 22:30.042
Anything out of the ordinary about him today?

22:31.001 --> 22:32.501
He had a fight with his wife

22:32.584 --> 22:33.834
A fight?

22:34.167 --> 22:35.626
Does he have any relatives in Beijing?

22:35.792 --> 22:38.126
No. I know for sure he doesn't

22:39.876 --> 22:43.209
I'm uncomfortable.
Can you cuff my hands in front of me?

22:48.417 --> 22:49.501
Him too

22:56.251 --> 22:58.501
Mr. Wu, are you married?

22:59.292 --> 23:00.334
No

23:00.501 --> 23:02.446
Is it true that Hong Kong stars

23:02.596 --> 23:04.542
don't want to get married early?

23:04.626 --> 23:05.709
Fans won't accept it?

23:05.792 --> 23:07.417
Just can": settle on one chick

23:07.501 --> 23:10.459
There's a lot of big shots on your phone

23:11.792 --> 23:13.542
Big movie stars

23:14.334 --> 23:17.126
She's my dream woman

23:18.042 --> 23:20.251
An autograph from her would rock

23:20.334 --> 23:23.376
Tell me. How much money do you want?

23:23.667 --> 23:25.167
How much do you have?

23:26.667 --> 23:31.251
There's 100.000 on that card.
You can overdraw some more

23:31.542 --> 23:32.751
And?

23:34.542 --> 23:39.167
There's another card at my home
with 3 million on it

23:39.876 --> 23:41.001
RMB?

23:41.834 --> 23:42.667
Yes

23:42.751 --> 23:44.584
Are you kidding me?

23:45.876 --> 23:48.709
Ask him. How much I wanted for your life?

23:50.584 --> 23:51.459
5 million

23:51.667 --> 23:54.001
You're cheaper than him?

23:55.292 --> 23:58.876
I know you expect a lot
but you must be realistic

23:59.709 --> 24:02.709
Do you think I'd lie in a situation like this?

24:05.459 --> 24:09.292
When did you become famous?
It was a long time ago

24:09.501 --> 24:11.251
I've been watching your films for years

24:12.126 --> 24:14.459
Only <i>3</i> million? You think I can believe that?

24:16.001 --> 24:17.780
It's payment for my next movie.

24:17.930 --> 24:19.709
My savings are in Hong Kong

24:19.792 --> 24:23.126
Have your family wire cash
from Hong Kong, can't you?

24:24.126 --> 24:27.126
I'm not saying no.
Just thinking what's best for you

24:27.834 --> 24:30.084
It's not easy to wire money from Hong Kong

24:30.292 --> 24:32.292
It will take a lot of time

24:33.417 --> 24:35.876
Withdrawing cash is more practical

24:35.959 --> 24:40.126
He rented a fancy apartment. I went there once

24:40.209 --> 24:41.626
Take me there

24:41.751 --> 24:43.001
Can you fire a gun?

24:43.501 --> 24:46.334
Never tried a real one.
The guns in movies are fake

24:46.417 --> 24:49.167
Let me introduce to you...

24:49.667 --> 24:54.667
a replica of a Soviet pistol from WW2

24:54.751 --> 24:58.667
You showed us your face
for two possible reasons

24:59.084 --> 25:01.709
Either you never expected us
to leave here alive,

25:01.917 --> 25:04.792
or you're a man with incredible confidence

25:05.292 --> 25:06.917
I hope it's the second one

25:07.542 --> 25:11.542
I also hope you get the money soon
so we can leave safely

25:11.626 --> 25:15.084
Can you promise the 3 million
won't cause me any problems?

25:17.751 --> 25:23.126
Can you promise to set us free
once you get the money?

25:25.126 --> 25:27.417
If I let you go

25:29.334 --> 25:31.417
You won't tell the cops?

25:31.792 --> 25:32.917
You have my word

25:33.334 --> 25:38.209
You're fine letting go of so much money?

25:38.292 --> 25:41.709
I accept it. I can make the money again

25:42.376 --> 25:44.042
But I only have one life

25:51.417 --> 25:52.792
Where do you live?

25:59.667 --> 26:01.584
This looks like the place
- Are you sure?

26:02.751 --> 26:04.417
It's hard to tell

26:04.834 --> 26:07.167
He drove me here after I paid him.

26:07.317 --> 26:08.959
But it was daytime

26:09.792 --> 26:12.167
At night, it's hard to recognize it

26:13.709 --> 26:14.667
One King

26:17.667 --> 26:22.459
Mr. Wu, I'm your fan. I really love your movies

26:23.126 --> 26:26.542
I looked you up online. You got married?

26:41.917 --> 26:44.126
What's that?
- Coke

26:48.209 --> 26:49.292
I can't drink it

26:49.792 --> 26:53.209
It'll kill me. I have acute diabetes

26:55.292 --> 26:56.834
Can I drink from the tap?

26:56.917 --> 26:58.917
No tap water. Only water from the well

27:01.751 --> 27:03.334
For me too

27:06.042 --> 27:07.542
Go get water from the well

27:07.834 --> 27:09.001
Don't peek at my cards

27:10.292 --> 27:11.459
Water from the well

27:12.167 --> 27:13.709
Just go and get some

27:15.959 --> 27:17.584
Would you please wash the cup first?

27:24.042 --> 27:26.459
Who'd drink water from the well
on a cold day like this?

27:29.501 --> 27:31.084
How are you? Are you okay?

27:31.459 --> 27:33.126
I'm used to it

27:33.542 --> 27:35.959
How long have you had diabetes?

27:37.084 --> 27:41.751
He lied. I wouldn't drink
just any water either. Right, Mr. Wu?

27:42.209 --> 27:44.251
My mother is a big fan too.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.126
She loves your films

27:46.709 --> 27:48.709
Who doesn't!

27:49.126 --> 27:51.709
Here. Iced water from the well for you both

27:53.584 --> 27:55.042
I hope you don't get diarrhea

28:08.042 --> 28:10.167
We've been driving in circles. Sorry about that

28:10.876 --> 28:12.542
I'm sure his apartment is in this neighborhood

28:15.834 --> 28:17.709
The one on the left. That seems right

28:20.209 --> 28:22.584
This one?
- Somehow it looks different now

28:33.501 --> 28:36.376
I have many friends in the media.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.417
Should we release something?

28:38.501 --> 28:40.584
Right now, it's not a good time
to alert the public

28:40.667 --> 28:42.917
You risk putting the hostages in greater danger

28:49.209 --> 28:50.584
Cao, it's Xing Feng

28:50.917 --> 28:52.751
I checked Mr. Wu's car GPS records.

28:52.901 --> 28:56.001
His place isn't far from you

28:56.376 --> 29:00.334
Current Balance: <i>3</i> million RMB

29:00.626 --> 29:02.626
Press #1 to continue your enquiry

29:14.334 --> 29:16.667
Could you win one single game?
- Whatever,

29:16.817 --> 29:18.001
I won't cheat

31:00.876 --> 31:01.834
Got it

31:05.792 --> 31:08.501
Boss wants us to tie them up with more chains

31:08.584 --> 31:10.376
With all the chains?
- Right

31:26.917 --> 31:28.792
An outgoing call was made 10 minutes ago

31:28.959 --> 31:29.917
What number?

31:30.126 --> 31:31.542
The bank's customer service line

31:33.084 --> 31:34.626
Can we get a surveillance video?

31:38.209 --> 31:40.376
Can you make out the license plate?
- It's obstructed

31:41.417 --> 31:43.459
Chief

31:43.542 --> 31:44.626
What's the update?

31:44.792 --> 31:47.001
We came up empty at the victim's home

31:47.167 --> 31:48.417
The suspect's car is our main clue.

31:48.567 --> 31:50.584
We're searching for it

31:51.417 --> 31:52.767
It's the same pattern.

31:52.917 --> 31:56.042
We can investigate with the Kong Bros' case

31:56.292 --> 31:57.667
Your old rivals?

31:57.751 --> 31:58.834
We had two run-ins

31:59.667 --> 32:01.876
Sit down please. Go ahead

32:02.751 --> 32:06.917
The suspect Zhang was released one year ago

32:07.167 --> 32:11.209
His accomplices are other inmates

32:11.292 --> 32:13.917
This gang committed two crimes back-to-back

32:20.501 --> 32:23.209
You're Second Brother Kong right? We're cops

32:23.292 --> 32:26.084
We need your cooperation
for our investigation. Okay?

32:29.834 --> 32:32.584
Can't you just cooperate?

32:38.584 --> 32:40.959
Okay. It's your call

32:43.001 --> 32:45.626
Big Brother Kong, I understand your concerns

32:45.709 --> 32:47.792
But we can't rush this.
We have to take it slowly

32:47.942 --> 32:49.251
Can you guarantee my brother's release?

32:49.334 --> 32:51.417
That he'll return alive?

32:52.209 --> 32:53.501
We have to work together

32:53.584 --> 32:56.292
How? You're not giving me much confidence

32:56.376 --> 32:58.251
Don't you see? They just want money.

32:58.401 --> 32:59.626
But money is nothing to me

33:01.001 --> 33:03.959
He wants one million right?
Then I'll give him two

33:04.584 --> 33:06.126
You guys should back off now

33:08.751 --> 33:10.634
Zhang had the victim's brother

33:10.784 --> 33:12.667
put the ransom in a canvas bag

33:13.209 --> 33:15.792
But during the exchange,
the brother wasn't cooperating with us

33:15.876 --> 33:17.334
The guy's driving fast

33:17.417 --> 33:19.334
I think they've spotted us;
they're trying to get away

33:19.584 --> 33:21.459
Have the others left your car?

33:21.751 --> 33:23.209
Where are you?

33:25.126 --> 33:26.642
On the bridge,

33:26.792 --> 33:29.292
stop when you see a bicycle
parked on your right

33:29.376 --> 33:30.959
Drop the money from there

33:31.042 --> 33:33.126
Chao, get out there and slow him down

33:36.042 --> 33:37.501
Kong. Don't!

33:37.584 --> 33:39.626
Who said you could follow me? Are you crazy?

33:39.709 --> 33:40.542
Don't act rashly

33:47.251 --> 33:50.792
To protect the hostage,
we couldn't shoot at him

33:51.209 --> 33:52.542
Road blocks didn't stop him either

33:52.626 --> 33:55.876
The escape route seems carefully planned

33:58.126 --> 34:01.792
Kong. I got the money. Thanks

34:01.876 --> 34:04.376
But I've something to tell you

34:04.542 --> 34:07.626
Your younger brother was too arrogant

34:08.083 --> 34:11.376
After kidnapping him,
I didn't want to keep him alive

34:11.667 --> 34:13.821
How about this. For another million,

34:13.971 --> 34:16.126
<i>I'll</i> tell you where he's buried

34:23.958 --> 34:26.167
Yu, someone's looking for you in the office

34:26.251 --> 34:28.208
<i>I'll</i> tell you where he's buried

34:28.667 --> 34:30.042
This is Zhang

34:32.667 --> 34:34.417
Hello, Mr. Wu

34:34.876 --> 34:37.626
Dou, let me tell you something

34:40.167 --> 34:42.376
I couldn't find your bank card!
- Impossible!

34:42.458 --> 34:45.542
Tell me where it is!

34:46.667 --> 34:49.237
Where is it? Not in your room!

34:49.388 --> 34:51.958
Think harder. Under your bed?

34:52.042 --> 34:53.792
Or did you leave it at your girlfriend's place?

34:53.876 --> 34:55.708
No!
- Anyway, I couldn't find it!

34:55.792 --> 34:57.042
Impossible!

34:57.459 --> 35:00.501
You'd better remember!

35:00.709 --> 35:02.542
It's where I said

35:02.626 --> 35:05.959
Are you sure? Is there any other money?

35:06.292 --> 35:07.792
No!

35:32.292 --> 35:34.626
You're a good actor

35:35.084 --> 35:38.417
It's a shame you didn't become
an actor yourself

35:40.126 --> 35:41.376
Were you a soldier?

35:44.751 --> 35:45.834
Yes

35:46.792 --> 35:50.376
I was a soldier in South China
before I moved to Hong Kong

35:51.376 --> 35:55.792
But you said you never fired a gun

35:57.251 --> 35:59.334
I was trying to protect myself

35:59.792 --> 36:01.209
Protect yourself?

36:04.126 --> 36:08.376
How am I supposed to trust you?

36:09.292 --> 36:12.709
Is the money on the card the amount I said?

36:14.626 --> 36:16.376
I haven't checked yet

36:18.292 --> 36:20.334
Let's make a video

36:20.584 --> 36:23.876
Come on. Say something
- Say what?

36:23.959 --> 36:29.334
Say you're fine.
That you're eating and drinking

36:29.501 --> 36:32.917
I'll keep the chains out of the shot. Action!

36:42.501 --> 36:44.001
It's me

36:47.876 --> 36:49.876
Why is it flashing?

36:49.959 --> 36:51.417
Flashing?

36:51.792 --> 36:52.834
Isn't it recording?

36:53.709 --> 36:54.792
It is. I'm filming it
- You can rewind it

36:54.942 --> 36:55.959
to check

36:56.834 --> 37:00.001
No. That's fast forward

37:00.292 --> 37:03.001
No. Let me take a look. I know how to do it

37:05.751 --> 37:06.834
This one...

37:09.709 --> 37:11.334
What is it?
- What did you do?

37:11.459 --> 37:13.417
What do you mean?

37:13.501 --> 37:15.309
You think you can stop me.

37:15.459 --> 37:16.584
I'll just record you with my phone!

37:16.667 --> 37:19.334
What's that for? Didn't you promise

37:19.484 --> 37:20.459
to free us once you're paid?!

37:20.542 --> 37:22.751
What are you filming for? What's your plan?

37:23.126 --> 37:25.126
What are you going to do with the video?
- Shut up!

37:25.292 --> 37:29.626
What are you doing?
You have more people and more guns

37:29.792 --> 37:31.792
But I'm not afraid of you.
You think you're tough?

37:32.292 --> 37:34.292
Put the gun down if you really are

37:35.167 --> 37:36.634
Shut up!
- We're all men here.

37:36.784 --> 37:38.251
We're supposed to honor our words

37:38.626 --> 37:41.459
I'm not judging you on your line of work

37:41.792 --> 37:44.667
But integrity means something
to you too, doesn't it?

37:45.042 --> 37:49.584
Otherwise, would your men respect you?
Would they?

37:51.834 --> 37:53.417
I promised to pay

37:54.584 --> 37:59.876
But I can't respect you when you play dirty

38:27.584 --> 38:29.042
What should I call you?

38:29.417 --> 38:30.542
Call me Zhang

38:30.751 --> 38:36.251
Zhang. The bank's opening soon.
Who's going to get the money?

38:36.501 --> 38:39.134
Pick a reliable friend

38:39.284 --> 38:41.917
and have him pick it up

38:42.001 --> 38:44.251
I can't do that to a friend

38:44.542 --> 38:49.251
You can rest assured that I'm a man
that plays by the rules

38:49.542 --> 38:54.792
Zhang plays by no rules.
There's nothing he won't do

38:56.667 --> 38:59.376
Kong, we're the police

38:59.542 --> 39:01.667
Stay where you are. We're the police

39:02.417 --> 39:04.667
There's a case that may involve you

39:04.751 --> 39:07.251
They're not cops! Call the police!

39:10.917 --> 39:13.209
Quickly, call the cops!

39:13.834 --> 39:15.542
Can't you cooperate?

39:31.959 --> 39:33.251
Licence plate #507

39:33.459 --> 39:35.667
By chance I was working with Cao nearby

39:35.817 --> 39:36.417
so we went together

39:36.501 --> 39:38.292
We didn't catch up with them
until we'd almost left the city

39:45.334 --> 39:46.667
Police! Freeze!

40:03.709 --> 40:05.292
Freeze!

40:18.251 --> 40:19.476
Cao, what's your status?

40:19.626 --> 40:22.126
We're giving chase.
On the outskirts of the city

40:22.917 --> 40:25.292
Faster!
- Shut up!

40:38.751 --> 40:39.667
Watch out for the grenade!

40:48.584 --> 40:51.167
After Zhang escaped, the gang broke up.

40:51.317 --> 40:52.584
They went into hiding

40:52.792 --> 40:54.876
We were able to track down some of them

41:05.417 --> 41:09.209
It was... who asked me to get Kong?

41:09.376 --> 41:10.376
Who?

41:10.834 --> 41:11.751
My brother

41:12.334 --> 41:14.001
Police! Freeze!

41:14.876 --> 41:15.792
Settle down!

41:16.042 --> 41:16.959
Come with me

41:20.376 --> 41:22.834
It was Dong who asked me to get Kong

41:22.917 --> 41:24.417
Where's Zhang?
- I don't know

41:24.501 --> 41:27.167
You'd better start cooperating
- I really don't know. I only know Dong

41:27.667 --> 41:30.167
Dong used to be a key figure in the gang

41:30.251 --> 41:32.792
We've been looking for him
since he split from Zhang

41:43.001 --> 41:44.209
Wu?

41:44.792 --> 41:48.042
I know it's late, but I need to ask a favor

41:48.667 --> 41:51.501
Alright. Just say it

41:53.834 --> 41:55.251
I've been kidnapped

42:01.584 --> 42:02.501
Where are you?

42:02.917 --> 42:04.167
Far away

42:05.376 --> 42:11.251
How far away? In the city,
in the suburbs, or where?

42:11.584 --> 42:12.792
Tell me!

42:14.501 --> 42:15.709
Don't ask...

42:19.834 --> 42:22.792
My kidnapper will call you

42:22.876 --> 42:25.084
Please withdraw my money and give it to him

42:25.751 --> 42:30.626
Make sure I'm still alive
before you give him the money

42:30.834 --> 42:32.042
And don't...

42:32.792 --> 42:33.834
Call the police

42:35.876 --> 42:38.834
And don't what? Call the police?

42:40.126 --> 42:41.334
What did you mean?

42:44.209 --> 42:46.751
It means what it means.

42:47.376 --> 42:49.334
Just relax, okay?

42:59.501 --> 43:02.459
He called. Can you come over right now?

43:05.167 --> 43:08.834
Mr. Wu called you because he trusts you.

43:08.984 --> 43:10.042
Don't betray that trust

43:10.959 --> 43:12.001
Okay?

43:16.209 --> 43:18.542
<i>I'll</i> call the bank when it opens.

43:19.501 --> 43:21.709
Otherwise, you can": withdraw so much money

43:23.542 --> 43:26.334
The car Zhang's driving was reported stolen

43:26.417 --> 43:28.292
I checked the surveillance.

43:28.442 --> 43:31.459
It points to B0

43:31.709 --> 43:33.425
I just sent Shengli to the bank.

43:33.575 --> 43:35.292
Now we know the place pretty well

43:35.501 --> 43:36.917
Let's work out a plan

43:41.292 --> 43:45.251
Just hours ago I was negotiating
with a big investor

43:45.334 --> 43:47.113
He agreed to pay me 10 million

43:47.263 --> 43:49.042
to shoot a film during New Year

43:49.542 --> 43:52.667
And now someone
asked a fraction of that

43:52.817 --> 43:54.417
for my life!

43:56.042 --> 43:57.251
All for the sake of money!

43:57.417 --> 44:02.167
Rich or poor, we're chained together here

44:03.167 --> 44:05.226
This is the first time

44:05.376 --> 44:08.584
I've shared a blanket with a man

44:09.542 --> 44:10.792
Not for me

44:13.459 --> 44:17.251
My brother and I shared a bed
when we were little

44:18.917 --> 44:21.917
I knew my life was finished
when I ended up here

44:22.251 --> 44:24.959
Everything will be okay.
Just pretend I'm your brother

44:30.626 --> 44:32.709
Nevermind. Let's share it

44:33.709 --> 44:35.626
Zhang, it's too cold!

44:35.709 --> 44:38.209
That's all. Now that you're here,
we're taking off

44:38.626 --> 44:39.726
Mr. Su,

44:39.876 --> 44:42.376
if you're concerned about your own safety

44:42.459 --> 44:44.292
we can take your place
when meeting the kidnappers

44:44.376 --> 44:48.501
Wu and I go way back.
We were in the army together

44:48.584 --> 44:52.292
He came to me at a time like this.
It means he trusts me

44:52.584 --> 44:54.709
They'll Contact you again.

44:54.751 --> 44:56.084
We'll be here, waiting with you

44:56.167 --> 44:58.542
Can't you tough it out?

44:58.751 --> 45:00.334
Maybe you'll be out of here by tomorrow

45:00.417 --> 45:01.584
Grab some sleep

45:03.209 --> 45:04.667
Do you go home for the New Year?

45:04.876 --> 45:09.167
Go home? I don't think I can go home

45:09.251 --> 45:12.126
In our line of work,
we can't go home when we want to

45:12.209 --> 45:13.709
Now that you mention home

45:15.334 --> 45:17.126
I really miss my mother

45:18.501 --> 45:21.126
Don't you have a code in your line of work?

45:21.542 --> 45:24.709
Yes, money rules

45:24.792 --> 45:29.834
Kidnapping is for money.
You don't have to kill people

45:30.251 --> 45:34.959
In the old days, the legendary bandits...

45:35.042 --> 45:37.792
In the old days! That's too long ago

45:38.042 --> 45:39.876
Don't mention ancient history

45:39.959 --> 45:42.167
Then we'll talk about the present

45:44.001 --> 45:47.292
There's someone in Hong Kong

45:47.442 --> 45:48.459
just like you...

45:48.542 --> 45:50.917
I know who you're talking about.

45:51.067 --> 45:52.917
To me he's nothing

45:53.834 --> 45:58.084
At least he follows his rules

45:58.167 --> 46:01.334
Are you afraid I'll change my mind
when I get my hands on the money?

46:01.417 --> 46:02.667
I have no choice but to place my trust in you

46:02.751 --> 46:06.001
Actually, you’ve earned my respect, Mr. Wu

46:06.751 --> 46:10.876
I mean it. The people I kidnap are usually weak

46:11.876 --> 46:14.917
Some had no humanity left
at the end. But you...

46:15.001 --> 46:16.959
Maybe it's because I was in the army

46:39.501 --> 46:42.417
Our son leaves hospital today.
You promised to stay with him

46:58.376 --> 46:59.626
Did you sleep well?

46:59.709 --> 47:01.001
Okay
- Let's return to work

47:02.417 --> 47:06.042
After leaving Wu's place,
Zhang drove northeast out of the city

47:10.584 --> 47:14.167
Kung Hey Fat Choy! How old were you then?

47:14.459 --> 47:17.417
Maybe 39

47:17.501 --> 47:19.251
You never age

47:19.709 --> 47:20.834
Thanks

47:21.501 --> 47:23.959
Everyone's lot in life is different

47:24.167 --> 47:26.167
Some are born high, some are born low

47:26.251 --> 47:28.751
One shouldn't complain,

47:29.042 --> 47:31.626
sometimes we make our own problems

47:32.292 --> 47:35.459
I don't mean you. I've my own issues.
I'm getting selfish and...

47:35.542 --> 47:37.251
Can you tell me what my problems are?

47:37.334 --> 47:38.126
You don't have any problems

47:38.209 --> 47:40.001
Right
- You really think so?

47:40.084 --> 47:43.251
Of course. I was in jail for nine years

47:43.334 --> 47:46.042
It felt like forever. But I eventually got out

47:46.126 --> 47:48.834
After nine years, can't you find
something real to do?

47:48.917 --> 47:52.459
Something real? You tell me
what something real is?

47:52.542 --> 47:54.167
Like finding yourself a job
- Working for somebody?

47:54.251 --> 47:56.376
Why not?
-9 to 5? Or maybe become an actor?

47:57.626 --> 47:59.542
First, I have no money

47:59.626 --> 48:01.834
Second, I have no big shot to back me up

48:01.917 --> 48:05.917
Third, I have no connections.
You tell me what I should do

48:06.001 --> 48:08.876
Okay, okay. So kidnapping it is then

48:08.959 --> 48:10.292
Kidnapping is better isn't it?

48:11.376 --> 48:12.792
Kidnapping is better

48:14.417 --> 48:16.584
Kidnapping isn't the goal

48:17.251 --> 48:18.709
What is the goal then?

49:24.792 --> 49:27.167
Are we getting out?
- Not your business!

49:31.084 --> 49:32.084
Stay still!

49:32.167 --> 49:34.959
Take it's easy. It's daytime.
Just covering your eyes

49:35.042 --> 49:37.459
Everything's okay. Please work with us, Mr. Wu

49:57.709 --> 49:59.309
Mr. Su, please put this on.

49:59.459 --> 50:01.501
This is the largest vest we have

50:04.584 --> 50:07.292
I know the risks. Death doesn't scare me

50:07.626 --> 50:10.334
Besides, do you really think it will fit?

50:11.626 --> 50:13.292
It's still a bit too small

50:20.959 --> 50:23.209
Good morning
- It's Mr. Wu

50:23.292 --> 50:24.834
What can I do for you?

50:24.917 --> 50:27.459
I need money for an emergency

50:27.542 --> 50:28.292
They're on the move

50:28.376 --> 50:30.334
Can you help me make the withdrawal?

50:30.667 --> 50:33.626
How much?
<i>-3</i> million

50:34.709 --> 50:36.126
Hello, Mr. Wu

50:40.334 --> 50:42.001
Mr. Lu, do me a favor

50:48.834 --> 50:51.001
The maximum you can withdraw today is 1 million

50:51.151 --> 50:52.751
1 million?
- They drove northeast.

50:52.901 --> 50:54.501
They should be in Shunyi by now

50:54.584 --> 50:56.542
We can file a special request for the rest.

50:56.692 --> 50:57.876
You'll get it tomorrow

50:58.084 --> 50:59.167
Alright

51:00.084 --> 51:02.334
Okay. That's all then

51:02.417 --> 51:03.584
Are you coming in person?

51:03.667 --> 51:05.209
No, a friend will

51:06.959 --> 51:09.167
I need to take a leak

51:10.084 --> 51:12.501
Hold it. We'll be home soon

51:12.584 --> 51:15.917
I can't wait. I can't hold it anymore

51:16.001 --> 51:18.042
Just hold it

51:18.126 --> 51:21.209
I can't. And my pants will get wet
and freeze up

51:23.167 --> 51:24.292
Pull over

51:24.751 --> 51:27.251
Our big star can't hold it anymore

51:27.334 --> 51:28.584
Thanks

51:32.834 --> 51:34.126
What are you doing?

51:34.251 --> 51:35.417
What's this?

51:35.542 --> 51:36.792
A pillar

51:41.792 --> 51:45.626
Please turn around.
I can't do it with you watching

51:46.459 --> 51:48.459
How do you know we're watching?

51:48.542 --> 51:49.876
I can feel it

51:55.376 --> 51:59.667
Zhang, how are you going to spend the money?

52:00.126 --> 52:01.251
Guns

52:01.334 --> 52:03.459
Guns? You already have guns, don't you?

52:03.542 --> 52:05.042
Not enough

52:08.626 --> 52:10.542
Okay. I'm finished

52:14.167 --> 52:15.501
Don't make this any harder

52:15.917 --> 52:18.446
If you try anything,

52:18.596 --> 52:21.126
I'll kill the driver too

52:23.292 --> 52:26.042
Su, wait for me at the bank

52:26.126 --> 52:27.126
OkaY

52:27.251 --> 52:28.667
You know which branch?

52:28.751 --> 52:32.251
Yes. Oh, is Mr. Wu with you?

52:32.334 --> 52:33.834
You can talk to him

52:35.084 --> 52:36.209
Su?

52:37.126 --> 52:38.084
I'm fine

52:38.251 --> 52:39.334
Did you hear that?

52:39.417 --> 52:40.376
I'd like to talk to him

52:40.459 --> 52:42.001
Cut the nonsense, okay?

52:42.209 --> 52:44.321
Nonsense? I'm cooperating.

52:44.471 --> 52:46.584
But I need to know he's safe

52:46.667 --> 52:49.626
So the cops are next to you?
That's why you sound tough

52:49.709 --> 52:51.751
What cops? Stop wasting my time

52:51.834 --> 52:56.167
Su, 10am. See you at the bank

53:00.834 --> 53:03.501
He was still playing with toys when I was
on the battlefield

53:05.209 --> 53:06.334
What's the color of the car?

53:06.417 --> 53:09.834
Silver grey. They didn't look like
good guys to me

53:13.459 --> 53:18.876
Mr. Wu, do you really want
to know why I need more guns?

53:19.209 --> 53:21.084
Tell me if you want to

53:21.209 --> 53:24.167
I met somebody in jail

53:24.334 --> 53:27.626
He was security for a bank vault.

53:27.709 --> 53:29.209
He and I really hit it off

53:29.667 --> 53:32.959
He enlightened me on a way to get rich quick

54:02.667 --> 54:06.584
All I need is three minutes
before the cops arrive

54:08.126 --> 54:12.667
Kidnapping is nothing. It's just for amateurs

54:12.792 --> 54:14.626
But you two have to keep my secret for me

54:17.876 --> 54:20.917
Zhang, I have a small request!

54:23.251 --> 54:27.042
I'd like an apple. "Apple" rhymes
with "safe" in Chinese

54:29.876 --> 54:31.751
This area is covered in apple trees,

54:31.901 --> 54:34.292
but there's no time

54:34.959 --> 54:39.334
If you don't hear from me by 9pm,

54:39.484 --> 54:40.959
then I'm in trouble

54:45.417 --> 54:46.917
Is it the tractor whose driver
filed the report?

54:47.001 --> 54:48.209
It is. It's verified

54:48.292 --> 54:50.459
<i>I'll</i> send somebody to the suburbs

54:50.542 --> 54:51.584
Okay, <i>I'll</i> send Chao to check it out

54:51.667 --> 54:55.126
We're setting up roadblocks now.
We'll let him through

55:02.959 --> 55:04.767
The suspect said 10am.

55:04.917 --> 55:06.542
The hostage might not be with him

55:06.876 --> 55:09.251
We'll arrest him as soon as he appears

55:09.834 --> 55:12.917
Snipers, if he goes for his gun,

55:13.067 --> 55:14.292
incapacitate him

55:14.417 --> 55:15.501
We want him alive

55:15.584 --> 55:16.667
Roger

55:36.667 --> 55:38.292
52 RMB

55:41.167 --> 55:42.167
Keep the change

55:42.251 --> 55:44.251
Thanks. Here's your receipt

55:48.084 --> 55:50.292
I want to know how this plays out for him

56:09.042 --> 56:11.959
Get to the lobby of Shangdong Mall
in 15 minutes

56:12.751 --> 56:16.042
Brother Wu, why did he tell us about the vault?

56:16.251 --> 56:18.042
Don't you think we know too much?

56:18.209 --> 56:20.292
It's just some madcap idea

56:21.209 --> 56:24.001
A fantasy that stands no chance

56:25.292 --> 56:26.751
You mean he's bragging?

56:32.042 --> 56:33.917
Mr. Wu, look here!

56:34.001 --> 56:37.417
Somebody online claims you were arrested

56:37.501 --> 56:38.626
What did they write?

56:39.709 --> 56:42.751
That your acting career is coming to an end

56:42.834 --> 56:46.042
Someone says it's for visiting hookers!

56:46.126 --> 56:47.626
Another one writes you're involved
with gangsters!

56:47.709 --> 56:52.459
Honestly, it'd be nice
if I really had been arrested

56:57.001 --> 56:58.876
I'm here. Where are you?

56:59.334 --> 57:01.876
Go to the pine tree in the middle of the atrium

57:02.417 --> 57:04.834
I left something there for you

57:04.917 --> 57:07.292
Don't be afraid. It's just an envelope

57:10.709 --> 57:11.834
Zhang may not be here

57:11.917 --> 57:13.876
Our target isn't there.
He's on the Fourth Ring Road

57:16.042 --> 57:18.001
There's nothing here
- I'm mistaken

57:18.084 --> 57:21.042
It's under the trash can

57:24.292 --> 57:25.959
What are you thinking about?

57:27.876 --> 57:30.709
MR. SU

57:34.126 --> 57:35.501
Bring up the south gate's surveillance footage

57:36.167 --> 57:37.459
From 10am

57:39.209 --> 57:41.042
Zoom in

57:41.751 --> 57:44.709
Drive in the direction the suspect came from

57:44.792 --> 57:47.626
See if you can find any recently rented houses

57:49.292 --> 57:50.476
Located the taxi.

57:50.626 --> 57:52.126
There's no surveillance camera
where he got off

57:52.209 --> 57:53.792
He was seen uncovering

57:53.942 --> 57:55.376
his license plate

57:55.751 --> 57:56.667
So he's going into the city

57:56.751 --> 57:58.876
A dozen houses are for rent

57:59.001 --> 58:00.459
Including the small courtyard of an orchard

58:00.542 --> 58:03.084
Don't give away any clue to why we're asking

58:11.542 --> 58:12.626
I'm exhausted

58:13.376 --> 58:17.376
Just because you wanted an apple,
I had to run a whole kilometer

58:17.459 --> 58:18.501
Couldn't you drive?

58:19.376 --> 58:21.626
Zhang said not to drive during the day

58:22.001 --> 58:23.792
They're clean. No need to wash them

58:26.626 --> 58:29.167
Go ahead. Zhang asked us to get them for you

58:29.959 --> 58:33.084
Don't worry. When you leave,
we'll give you a good send off

58:40.126 --> 58:41.167
One million

58:43.792 --> 58:45.529
No word for a long time.

58:45.679 --> 58:47.417
Is Mr. Wu in danger?

58:47.501 --> 58:51.001
Don't worry, Mr. Su. They probably want
delivery at night

58:54.001 --> 58:56.084
Got the money?
- Yes

58:56.167 --> 58:57.501
What denomination?

58:57.751 --> 59:00.042
100 RMB notes. There's no 500 RMB notes

59:00.126 --> 59:01.626
I'll call you back this evening

59:03.084 --> 59:06.834
He's on the Third Ring Road. He's pretty close

59:06.917 --> 59:09.376
Scouting during the day, taking action at night.
The same trick again

59:09.501 --> 59:11.876
Put more people on the streets to find his car

59:17.292 --> 59:20.959
Get up! We're the police. Sit up!

59:22.292 --> 59:23.542
What's your name?

59:27.251 --> 59:28.376
Stop!

59:33.167 --> 59:34.251
Behave yourself!

59:35.792 --> 59:36.876
Squat

59:37.001 --> 59:39.834
All I did was get two cars for Dong.

59:39.984 --> 59:40.709
I don't know anything

59:40.792 --> 59:42.167
Doesn't Dong have a mobile phone?

59:43.542 --> 59:46.167
Sometimes yes, sometime no

59:46.251 --> 59:50.084
Don't play tricks. Why'd you ask
about tickets the past two days?

59:52.001 --> 59:53.209
Dong showed up

59:53.959 --> 59:55.251
Looks like he's trying to run

59:55.751 --> 59:57.209
Get some help! Let's go!

01:00:11.626 --> 01:00:12.751
Stop pushing!

01:00:18.376 --> 01:00:19.459
Dong!

01:00:21.459 --> 01:00:23.251
Stop! Police!

01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:36.626
Freeze!

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:53.667
Where is Zhang?

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:55.626
I don't know. I really don't

01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:56.709
Behave yourself!

01:00:56.834 --> 01:00:58.101
But I got to tell you

01:00:58.251 --> 01:00:59.751
he has a grenade on him all the time

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:01.292
He's ready to die with you guys

01:01:01.376 --> 01:01:02.959
Shoot to kill if you see him

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:04.042
Shut up!

01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:06.351
Dong wants Zhang dead,

01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:08.417
so there's no witnesses left

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:10.917
Zhang told him

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.459
he rented a farmhouse in the suburbs

01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:15.292
Next to an orchard

01:01:15.376 --> 01:01:18.042
Orchard? What kind of orchard?

01:01:18.251 --> 01:01:19.501
He doesn't know

01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:23.792
Get more people. We need more manpower

01:01:24.001 --> 01:01:27.417
The main team looks for his car in the city;
the rest locate the courtyard

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:31.167
There's no word for a long time.
Why not give him a call?

01:01:31.292 --> 01:01:33.376
He changes his SIM card with every call.

01:01:33.526 --> 01:01:35.459
Nobody knows his number

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:36.876
You seem to know a lot

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:38.709
Of course, he's played a cop so many times

01:01:38.792 --> 01:01:39.834
Have you seen my movies?

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:41.626
I have

01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:43.334
What do you think of my acting?

01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:47.126
I'd say it's just okay

01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:51.001
You should take kidnapping roles more often

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:55.876
That'd be great. I could use you as a model

01:01:55.959 --> 01:01:59.042
Do you think I can become a star someday?

01:02:02.834 --> 01:02:04.876
Maybe

01:02:05.584 --> 01:02:08.751
Search within a 3km radius of the target's
last known position

01:02:08.834 --> 01:02:11.667
No progress yet. No sighting of the target

01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:13.251
I'm still looking. Nothing yet

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.417
No sightings around his mother's home

01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:17.709
No sightings from Team #6
- Team #9 has nothing to report

01:02:17.792 --> 01:02:19.501
Team #3 is still searching. No sightings

01:02:24.667 --> 01:02:26.376
Where's he?

01:02:26.792 --> 01:02:28.542
He's inside our target area.

01:02:28.692 --> 01:02:30.251
We'll find him

01:02:49.084 --> 01:02:50.675
I've checked a dozen courtyards.

01:02:50.825 --> 01:02:52.417
Do I need to cruise the streets?

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:54.017
Stick with the courtyards.

01:02:54.167 --> 01:02:55.917
Enough people are on the streets

01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:57.417
OkaY

01:02:57.501 --> 01:02:58.584
Have you eaten yet?

01:02:58.667 --> 01:02:59.751
Not yet

01:03:17.417 --> 01:03:18.417
Got it! Coming!

01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:20.459
Control, we've found the suspect's car

01:03:21.209 --> 01:03:22.334
Is anybody inside?

01:03:22.709 --> 01:03:25.559
No. We found it by chance

01:03:25.709 --> 01:03:27.209
we can": pinpoint the building

01:03:27.626 --> 01:03:29.376
Okay. Continue the search.
Our men will be there soon

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:34.001
Yes or no?

01:03:34.084 --> 01:03:35.167
Wait. Let me think

01:03:35.584 --> 01:03:36.584
Yes or no?

01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:39.917
Cang, will you still gamble
when you get your share?

01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:41.417
I can't help myself

01:03:42.001 --> 01:03:42.959
Which one should I keep?

01:03:45.626 --> 01:03:47.126
I don't play. I don't know the odds

01:03:47.209 --> 01:03:48.792
Go with your gut

01:03:51.084 --> 01:03:52.167
This one

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:54.751
Two kings!

01:03:55.209 --> 01:04:00.959
A bomb! A flush and two tens

01:04:02.042 --> 01:04:03.917
What the hell?

01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:08.126
What? A bomb? How am I supposed
to know what a bomb is?

01:04:08.209 --> 01:04:09.376
You don't know what a bomb is?

01:04:09.834 --> 01:04:12.417
Didn't you act in "God of Gamblers"?
You've ruined me

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.209
Does that even make sense?

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:17.876
I also play oops. I should have arrested you

01:04:19.834 --> 01:04:22.001
Shuffle them!

01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:37.751
Chao, where are you?

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:40.667
Okay. Hurry up!

01:04:42.084 --> 01:04:46.876
The shot you took at Dong today
was right on target

01:04:48.126 --> 01:04:52.376
I thought you'd forgotten. You owe me a dinner

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:53.709
Thank you

01:04:54.001 --> 01:04:56.209
So what's the situation here?

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:59.417
Zhang must come out to collect the ransom

01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:01.434
There's only one exit

01:05:01.584 --> 01:05:03.042
so we can ambush him right here

01:05:03.209 --> 01:05:04.834
We'll take him the moment he steps out

01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:07.417
The area is a big chaotic and it's too crowded

01:05:08.667 --> 01:05:11.459
Zhang has guns and even a grenade

01:05:49.459 --> 01:05:50.334
Chief Li

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:51.959
As you're there, you know the situation better

01:05:52.376 --> 01:05:53.917
If the public will be put in danger,

01:05:54.067 --> 01:05:55.126
don't tackle him there

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:57.834
It's not suitable for the operation

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:05.334
Can you leave it somewhere else?

01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:06.626
What?

01:06:09.834 --> 01:06:12.501
Give it to me!

01:06:12.584 --> 01:06:13.751
Let go!

01:06:17.084 --> 01:06:18.376
Darn it!

01:06:42.084 --> 01:06:43.292
Are you coming back?

01:06:43.876 --> 01:06:45.084
Yes

01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:49.792
But when?

01:06:51.959 --> 01:06:56.209
Soon, a day, or in two weeks?

01:06:58.876 --> 01:07:00.792
Don't play with guns

01:07:07.959 --> 01:07:11.584
Listen to me. If I die,

01:07:12.167 --> 01:07:15.667
have the baby for my mother's sake

01:07:16.251 --> 01:07:19.334
If you die, I'm not keeping the child

01:07:23.459 --> 01:07:25.209
I'm not kidding!

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:40.834
He's out

01:07:47.876 --> 01:07:49.084
He's got into the car

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:51.417
Someone looked out of a window above.
Seemed to be a woman

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:58.542
The car's moving. I'm following.
Those outside, stay alert

01:07:58.626 --> 01:08:00.626
I'm so sorry
- Get away!

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:05.459
Don't let him get away

01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:07.792
Don't worry. We'll take him today

01:08:17.959 --> 01:08:20.292
He's deliberately circling.
Xing Feng, back off a bit

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:22.292
Okay. I'll drive straight ahead. Guo, take over

01:08:22.376 --> 01:08:23.376
OkaY

01:08:34.626 --> 01:08:37.792
Don't tell me where to go yet.

01:08:37.942 --> 01:08:40.376
I have to see Mr. Wu

01:08:40.459 --> 01:08:44.042
He's in my car. We'll make the exchange

01:08:44.334 --> 01:08:46.292
Two more blocks and his tire's gonna be flat

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:48.376
Chao, wait for him at the next intersection

01:08:48.459 --> 01:08:49.167
No problem

01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:52.542
We're keeping him on the phone.
He hasn't given a location yet

01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:55.626
Why are you going around in circles,

01:08:55.776 --> 01:08:57.584
it's making me dizzy

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.459
Why am I doing all this?
Of course, for my friend

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:02.751
Guo, you take a right ahead.
I'll stay on his tail

01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:10.834
I'm back to base. <i>I'll</i> wait at the garage

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:11.934
We scouted this location.

01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:14.167
When you turn right, you'll see the garage

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.801
The money's right here.

01:09:16.951 --> 01:09:19.296
Let me speak to my friend

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:21.792
I drugged him. He's sleeping

01:09:21.876 --> 01:09:24.251
You drugged him? Then <i>I'll</i> wait
until he wakes up

01:09:24.334 --> 01:09:25.251
How about this...

01:09:25.334 --> 01:09:26.834
You alert him

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:29.376
Buddy, you've got a flat tire!

01:09:29.459 --> 01:09:32.459
Stop playing or I'll kill him. I mean it

01:09:33.001 --> 01:09:34.334
Your tire is flat

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:43.584
It's Zhang. Everyone, get into position

01:09:44.126 --> 01:09:47.334
It's dangerous. Tell everyone to be careful

01:09:56.084 --> 01:09:59.001
Why are you parking there?
Do you think you own the road?

01:09:59.084 --> 01:10:00.417
What an attitude!

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:23.042
He's out of his car
- Sir, can I help you?

01:10:23.376 --> 01:10:24.459
My tire. Have a look at it

01:10:24.542 --> 01:10:26.376
His hands are in his pockets

01:10:26.834 --> 01:10:29.876
Let me get my tools
- Looks like a punctured tire. See!

01:10:34.917 --> 01:10:38.251
Chief. It's a good opportunity.
Shall we take him now?

01:10:42.626 --> 01:10:44.459
Xing Feng, take him!

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:49.251
Xing Feng, he's carrying a gun and a grenade.

01:10:49.334 --> 01:10:51.167
Don't let him get away
- No worries

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.059
"Your son is still waiting."

01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:57.292
"Call him when you have a moment"

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:01.126
Cao, should something happen to me...

01:11:01.209 --> 01:11:04.834
Cut it out. Focus on bringing him in

01:11:06.376 --> 01:11:08.417
Everyone, follow the plan!

01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:10.542
<i>L'll</i> grab his arms. Others hold him down.

01:11:10.692 --> 01:11:11.876
Cao will handle the grenade

01:11:26.417 --> 01:11:29.876
Who's that woman?! I'm talking to you!

01:11:30.251 --> 01:11:32.001
A workmate!

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:35.876
Why didn't you pick up my call?

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.167
What's her name?

01:11:48.126 --> 01:11:49.417
Police! Freeze!

01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:50.709
Let go!

01:11:54.834 --> 01:11:57.251
He took out the safety pin!

01:12:03.584 --> 01:12:05.459
Okay, we've got him! Mission accomplished!

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:07.001
He had two guns and a grenade on him

01:12:07.251 --> 01:12:08.334
Bring him over now

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:18.001
Go! Get inside!

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:24.084
Which room?
- The one at the end

01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.292
Mind your step!

01:12:32.751 --> 01:12:34.042
Here!

01:12:35.584 --> 01:12:38.334
Stand straight! Against the wall!

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:41.917
Stand straight!
- Can you talk?

01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:42.876
Yes

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:44.209
Do you know why we arrested you?

01:12:44.376 --> 01:12:46.542
What specifically are you talking about?
- Let's begin with the last one

01:12:46.626 --> 01:12:48.417
What the last one to you?

01:12:48.501 --> 01:12:49.542
You don't want to cooperate?

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:52.042
I do. But tell me who you're talking about

01:12:52.126 --> 01:12:53.792
Give me a name so I know how much you know

01:12:54.209 --> 01:12:55.626
Wu!
- Wu what?

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:57.251
The movie actor. Need I say more?

01:13:00.292 --> 01:13:01.376
So you do know!

01:13:01.459 --> 01:13:02.667
Is this just a game to you?

01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:04.292
Do you know this guy?

01:13:05.126 --> 01:13:06.834
No
- He's our chief

01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:09.376
How'd you get to know Mr. Wu?

01:13:09.876 --> 01:13:11.959
Who? I didn't know him

01:13:12.209 --> 01:13:14.042
So it's not for revenge?
- No. Not at all

01:13:14.334 --> 01:13:15.876
Did you target him?

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:18.292
I thought he was Chow Yun-fat!

01:13:18.376 --> 01:13:19.751
Where did you take him?

01:13:22.751 --> 01:13:24.001
Listen up!

01:13:24.209 --> 01:13:25.476
If you ask me that,

01:13:25.626 --> 01:13:27.084
of course I can't tell you!

01:13:27.292 --> 01:13:29.292
I also hope nothing will happen to Mr. Wu

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:32.501
How about I call my men to evacuate first

01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:36.251
And then <i>I'll</i> take you there. How's that?

01:13:36.334 --> 01:13:37.917
Evacuate where?
- Run away

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:39.001
Run away to where?

01:13:39.459 --> 01:13:41.834
Wherever. That isn't my concern anymore

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:44.792
You think you can flee this world. What a joke!

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:47.417
Can you loosen my handcuffs?

01:13:47.501 --> 01:13:49.376
In your dreams!
- Spit it out!

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:52.001
How do you expect me to cooperate
when you're so stubborn

01:13:52.084 --> 01:13:53.751
Let me talk to the one
who arrested me. Understand?

01:13:55.251 --> 01:13:56.834
Hello. It's the apartment management

01:13:56.917 --> 01:13:58.126
We need to check a water leak,

01:13:58.276 --> 01:14:00.667
please open UP

01:14:02.459 --> 01:14:04.417
There's no leak here. Check other apartments

01:14:10.501 --> 01:14:13.751
Don't move! Squat down
and place your hands on your head!

01:14:14.084 --> 01:14:15.876
Come back quickly, okay!

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:19.751
Chief Zhang, her name is Chen.
We didn't know about her

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.792
She could be someone he just met

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.517
She's not well.

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:26.126
Liu Yun took her to the hospital

01:14:34.126 --> 01:14:35.459
Zhang, what's it going to be?

01:14:35.542 --> 01:14:37.542
You want to try your luck one last time, right?

01:14:37.626 --> 01:14:39.267
I underestimated you.

01:14:39.417 --> 01:14:41.334
I really mistook you for a migrant worker

01:14:41.417 --> 01:14:43.876
Get to it. Say what you need to say

01:14:43.959 --> 01:14:45.209
Can you get to the point?

01:14:45.876 --> 01:14:47.084
I didn't expect you
to be a better actor than me

01:14:47.167 --> 01:14:49.667
Zhang, if you want a one-on-one conversation,

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.584
then stop wasting time. Where's the hostage?

01:14:59.001 --> 01:15:00.376
Can I start from the beginning?

01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:01.751
Go ahead

01:15:34.084 --> 01:15:37.751
Cang, the noodles are ready.
They'll warm you up

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:40.792
Are you nuts?! Why didn't you just yell out?

01:15:41.001 --> 01:15:41.917
Have some noodles first

01:15:42.001 --> 01:15:43.751
Zhang asked us to keep our voices down

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:53.292
Why are you afraid to answer the phone?

01:16:02.584 --> 01:16:03.917
Were the dumplings good?

01:16:05.042 --> 01:16:07.126
Just so-so
- Not as good as home-cooked ones?

01:16:07.209 --> 01:16:09.042
Nothing compares to my mom's dumplings

01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:11.792
Thought things through? Ready to talk?

01:16:14.084 --> 01:16:15.084
I'm getting there

01:16:15.167 --> 01:16:16.434
If you keep dawdling,

01:16:16.584 --> 01:16:18.667
your buddies will get anxious

01:16:18.751 --> 01:16:21.459
Don't worry about them.
I'm the boss. I call the shots

01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:23.459
Can you stop talking about being the big boss?

01:16:23.542 --> 01:16:24.667
Why?

01:16:25.251 --> 01:16:26.209
You get <i>3</i> million

01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:28.876
But Dong only 100.000. What were you thinking?

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:31.209
Who told you that?
- Dong did!

01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:33.084
I have my own rules when it comes
to dividing money

01:16:33.167 --> 01:16:35.376
You give money to your girlfriend

01:16:35.526 --> 01:16:36.251
but not your buddies?

01:16:36.334 --> 01:16:38.501
You call them rules. I call it dishonorable

01:16:38.584 --> 01:16:40.217
What's dishonorable about it?

01:16:40.367 --> 01:16:41.851
It's my money and my rules

01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:42.917
Tell me how you divide the money

01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:45.142
However I well please!

01:16:45.292 --> 01:16:46.751
I've gotta keep some for myself, right?

01:16:46.834 --> 01:16:47.726
What for?

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:49.251
To buy guns and pay the rent!

01:16:49.334 --> 01:16:50.917
Why rent?
- To keep hostages!

01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:52.334
To ransom?
- Sure!

01:16:52.417 --> 01:16:55.084
And release them after payment?
- Should I? I have to kill them

01:16:55.167 --> 01:16:56.334
And bury them?
- Bury them

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:58.751
And plant a peach tree on top?
Or it plum or apricot trees?

01:16:58.834 --> 01:17:00.376
An apple tree!

01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:03.917
But any tree will do

01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:09.292
Are there apple trees on any of the grounds
under your watch?

01:17:12.626 --> 01:17:16.084
Have you thought what to do
if Zhang is arrested?

01:17:16.209 --> 01:17:17.459
Why hasn't he called yet?

01:17:17.542 --> 01:17:20.209
Stop it. I'm the boss when he's not here

01:17:20.292 --> 01:17:23.251
I played a cop in a movie once. There's a line:

01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:26.709
"The minimum sentence for kidnapping
is 10 years."

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:30.917
Were you playing a Hong Kong cop
or a Mainland cop?

01:17:31.459 --> 01:17:32.792
A mainland cop!

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:38.584
Mr. Wu, you're a good guy

01:17:38.876 --> 01:17:42.792
Actually, they don't watch
your movies much,

01:17:42.942 --> 01:17:44.834
but I do

01:17:45.376 --> 01:17:49.959
And I've always thought you really great

01:17:50.376 --> 01:17:52.042
Thank you. Go on

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:53.876
I can't seem to think straight

01:17:54.084 --> 01:17:55.167
Go on

01:17:56.876 --> 01:17:58.126
No. I can't

01:18:01.001 --> 01:18:02.042
Playing for time?

01:18:03.001 --> 01:18:04.751
It won't change the outcome

01:18:09.167 --> 01:18:11.626
Zhang wants to see his girlfriend

01:18:11.776 --> 01:18:12.434
Which one?

01:18:12.584 --> 01:18:13.559
The woman in the apartment today

01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:16.709
He said she's pregnant and it's his last chance
to tell her something

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.154
It's just an excuse.

01:18:18.304 --> 01:18:19.517
He's plotting something

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:22.542
Whatever his plan, let's say yes

01:18:22.626 --> 01:18:24.584
Does he think his girlfriend is still at home?

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:27.876
We told him nothing.
Did we find anything in her apartment?

01:18:27.959 --> 01:18:29.001
A gun

01:18:29.084 --> 01:18:30.876
It's better in the hospital then

01:18:30.959 --> 01:18:32.376
Do we have enough time?

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:33.584
The hospital isn't far

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:35.126
Get everything there locked down

01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:37.251
We're not leaving them alone together anyway

01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:39.542
Okay, then. Let's do it

01:18:41.251 --> 01:18:44.417
It's as much our opportunity as his

01:18:45.251 --> 01:18:48.251
You guys have guts! If you didn't act fast,

01:18:48.401 --> 01:18:49.584
we'd all be dead

01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.209
The way I see it though, you were too slow

01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:54.001
It was a close call.
You should have just shot me dead

01:18:54.084 --> 01:18:56.084
Wishing you were dead? That's no fun.

01:18:56.234 --> 01:18:57.251
I wanted to chat with you myself

01:18:57.334 --> 01:18:59.959
You're a great guy. Did you break a bone
when you fell?

01:19:00.042 --> 01:19:02.292
My back is fine. I can take a fall like that

01:19:07.751 --> 01:19:09.001
I should say something

01:19:09.084 --> 01:19:12.584
There's no harm in being optimistic...

01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:16.376
But...

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:17.626
Go on...

01:19:19.292 --> 01:19:22.626
You're not going to act in any more movies

01:19:23.084 --> 01:19:26.084
What?! What did you say?

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:29.834
Honestly, whether we get the money or not,

01:19:29.984 --> 01:19:32.709
you're not leaving alive

01:19:33.167 --> 01:19:35.917
Zhang always wanted it that way.

01:19:36.067 --> 01:19:37.417
There's nothing I can do

01:19:37.501 --> 01:19:41.459
All I can do is say I'm sorry

01:19:44.542 --> 01:19:45.626
Eat up!

01:19:51.501 --> 01:19:56.376
Don't Cry!

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.417
You can't cry!

01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:01.167
Listen to him! Crying's useless

01:20:01.251 --> 01:20:06.084
You beat us, take our money
and think you can just say sorry!

01:20:06.709 --> 01:20:08.751
Help!

01:20:08.834 --> 01:20:11.959
You guys don't play fair!

01:20:15.376 --> 01:20:17.126
Enough!

01:20:18.126 --> 01:20:20.459
Okay. Stop hollering!

01:20:23.959 --> 01:20:25.417
It's useless to cry out. Stop it!

01:20:27.084 --> 01:20:33.376
Are you sure? I thought Zhang
was a man of honor

01:20:33.459 --> 01:20:36.792
Man of honor? He's a lunatic!

01:20:37.167 --> 01:20:39.626
He treats me like shit.
Why should he treat you any better

01:20:40.251 --> 01:20:42.376
Just accept your fate

01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:45.376
Double check the locks

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:54.501
Leave nobody alive.
It's not like you're our first

01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:00.667
Bury him alive

01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:06.126
When I kidnapped him,
I didn't want to keep him alive

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:09.001
How about this? For another million

01:21:09.084 --> 01:21:11.042
<i>I'll</i> tell you where he's buried

01:21:11.126 --> 01:21:12.542
Thank you, doctor

01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:15.376
Did you hear that? You're okay

01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:18.001
You're to meet your boyfriend in a little while

01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:19.167
What's happening to him?

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:22.626
Let's cooperate. We won't be hard on you

01:21:23.001 --> 01:21:27.251
I don't get why you want to see her
and not your mother

01:21:27.626 --> 01:21:30.876
What can I say to my mother?
That I'm going to be executed?

01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:35.334
If I die, the person
who'll take it hardest is her

01:21:35.417 --> 01:21:36.626
So you regret your actions?

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:39.092
I only regret not killing her

01:21:39.242 --> 01:21:41.626
the day I got out of prison

01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:44.001
What are you saying?
- If I did,

01:21:44.084 --> 01:21:46.167
she'd not feel pain when I die

01:21:46.376 --> 01:21:47.792
I'd have no more attachments

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:51.042
This isn't the way to my girl's place

01:21:51.126 --> 01:21:52.292
We took her to the hospital

01:21:52.376 --> 01:21:53.667
Why the hospital?

01:21:53.751 --> 01:21:55.084
She wasn't well

01:22:08.334 --> 01:22:11.292
Your girlfriend is coming downstairs.
You'll wait for her here

01:22:11.376 --> 01:22:12.917
Can't we go up to see her?

01:22:13.001 --> 01:22:13.959
Is this up to you?

01:22:14.042 --> 01:22:15.667
Not up to me. But what's the difference

01:22:15.817 --> 01:22:17.001
between here and up there?

01:22:17.542 --> 01:22:21.376
There she is! Right? You can talk right here

01:22:22.001 --> 01:22:23.876
Can't we talk alone

01:22:23.959 --> 01:22:26.334
Do you really expect that?
- Can't we have a little privacy?

01:22:26.417 --> 01:22:27.584
What would you say out of earshot, Zhang

01:22:27.734 --> 01:22:28.980
Nothing!
- She's here.

01:22:29.130 --> 01:22:30.376
What are you waiting for?

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:34.667
Wei...

01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:42.459
This may be our last time together.
Why don't you hug me?

01:22:45.751 --> 01:22:47.292
What's going on?

01:22:48.584 --> 01:22:49.501
Why?

01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:50.959
Can't you see what's happening?

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:53.376
But why?
- It's our last time together.

01:22:53.526 --> 01:22:55.001
Give me a kiss

01:22:55.209 --> 01:22:56.292
Break them up!

01:22:57.251 --> 01:22:59.292
What are you doing?
- Tell me your surname

01:23:02.459 --> 01:23:03.667
Tell me your family name please!

01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:06.126
I'm dead already
- Don't listen to him

01:23:07.376 --> 01:23:09.126
Don't lie to me!

01:23:09.209 --> 01:23:10.126
Get inside. It's cold out here

01:23:10.209 --> 01:23:11.584
I'm a dead man

01:23:14.751 --> 01:23:15.876
What's hidden there?

01:23:15.959 --> 01:23:17.001
Take a guess

01:23:17.084 --> 01:23:19.251
Zhang, you're disgusting!

01:23:19.334 --> 01:23:21.417
Take off his pants in the car. See what he hid

01:23:23.334 --> 01:23:24.584
<i>I'll</i> do <i>it</i>

01:23:32.376 --> 01:23:35.501
A key for handcuffs in his pants

01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:37.084
Zhang, we've done our best for you, haven't we?

01:23:37.167 --> 01:23:38.459
You guys are amazing!
- What other tricks do you have?

01:23:38.542 --> 01:23:39.876
Just tell us now!

01:23:40.376 --> 01:23:43.584
Is it okay if I don't? I changed my mind

01:23:49.501 --> 01:23:51.251
Get up!

01:23:53.834 --> 01:23:55.001
Okay. We've got it!

01:24:00.209 --> 01:24:01.584
We'll take you there

01:24:22.251 --> 01:24:23.751
This is the last meal for both of you

01:24:24.417 --> 01:24:26.667
Dig in so you'll have a full stomach
when you're on your way

01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:44.959
What kind of dumplings?

01:24:45.292 --> 01:24:46.376
Pork

01:24:47.626 --> 01:24:49.709
I don't eat meat. I'm a vegetarian

01:24:50.751 --> 01:24:53.376
Nobody told us.
We didn't prepare anything veggie

01:24:58.084 --> 01:25:01.167
Lift it up again.
I want to see the fireworks too

01:25:42.459 --> 01:25:45.376
By 9pm, whether Zhang calls or not,

01:25:45.526 --> 01:25:46.959
you'll be on your way

01:25:58.542 --> 01:26:03.167
Stop. <i>I'll</i> be by your side until the very end

01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:07.542
Brother Wu, aren't you scared?

01:26:10.084 --> 01:26:16.876
I am. But because you're here I have
to act brave

01:26:18.876 --> 01:26:21.667
Your just being alive gives me hope, you know?

01:26:26.834 --> 01:26:32.167
That sports car belongs to my girlfriend,
my real girlfriend

01:26:33.667 --> 01:26:36.542
But if I'd asked her to send money,

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:38.417
I'd have put her in danger

01:26:39.751 --> 01:26:41.309
I want to deal with this alone.

01:26:41.459 --> 01:26:44.626
She might not even know I'm in trouble

01:26:45.751 --> 01:26:47.667
You acted like a real man

01:26:48.376 --> 01:26:50.292
There's no hope for us now

01:26:50.626 --> 01:26:55.584
We can hope the last mile of our journey

01:26:55.734 --> 01:26:57.251
won't be too rough

01:26:59.167 --> 01:27:01.542
Have you watched my comedies?

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.084
Let me act one out for you?

01:27:11.667 --> 01:27:14.751
Have you been to my concerts?

01:27:16.292 --> 01:27:21.084
I tried but couldn't get a ticket
to your last one

01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:25.126
Your graves are ready

01:27:32.459 --> 01:27:36.334
Zhang said we'll plant an apple tree afterwards

01:27:37.667 --> 01:27:41.209
Mr. Wu, apples are your favorite, aren't they?

01:28:05.084 --> 01:28:10.792
"Applause comes in the midst of cheers"

01:28:12.501 --> 01:28:17.376
"And a smile takes the place of tears"

01:28:19.251 --> 01:28:25.834
"Curtains up, a happy face is revealed"

01:28:27.251 --> 01:28:32.167
"He keeps his loneliness concealed"

01:28:36.584 --> 01:28:44.542
"Sweat and tears"

01:28:45.584 --> 01:28:50.792
"He's endured them for years, to stand here"

01:28:54.001 --> 01:29:01.376
"Be it for shame or for glory",

01:29:02.167 --> 01:29:10.209
"Who else knew what he had to pay"

01:29:12.334 --> 01:29:20.542
"A clown, just a clown"

01:29:21.334 --> 01:29:29.459
"He masked his sorrow with a smile",

01:29:30.459 --> 01:29:37.042
"just for you"

01:29:43.959 --> 01:29:47.709
Make a left turn ahead.
The highway would be faster

01:29:47.792 --> 01:29:52.417
Keep going straight.
The third left turn is a shortcut

01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:54.209
You actually know where it is

01:29:54.292 --> 01:29:57.917
Zhang, you asked them to wait until 9pm, right?

01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:01.417
But there's guy who might disobey
my instructions

01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:04.642
I was going to kill him

01:30:04.792 --> 01:30:06.376
as soon as I got hold of the ransom

01:30:08.542 --> 01:30:11.751
Aren't you afraid Zhang won't return
with the money?

01:30:11.834 --> 01:30:14.876
I don't mind telling you,
that if he did come back,

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:18.459
he'd want to kill me
before dividing up the ransom

01:30:18.542 --> 01:30:21.042
Cang, you worry too much!

01:30:21.126 --> 01:30:22.959
Or maybe I'll kill him first

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:26.042
Your slaughtering each other will be a sight

01:30:26.376 --> 01:30:27.709
It's a pity I can't witness it

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:48.376
Let's clean out and get ready to leave

01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:51.584
It's not yet 9pm. Zhang said 9pm

01:30:51.917 --> 01:30:53.501
So it's whenever he says?

01:30:53.584 --> 01:30:55.459
He's the boss. Who else shall we listen to?

01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:57.542
So what I say means nothing?

01:30:57.959 --> 01:31:00.584
Stop it! It's only a few minutes difference

01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:08.126
Does this place look familiar?

01:31:09.084 --> 01:31:11.167
Tell me how many people are there?

01:31:44.917 --> 01:31:46.334
Chief, your call is really timely

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:47.667
How did you identify the place?

01:31:47.751 --> 01:31:50.001
The tractor driver gave us the area

01:31:50.084 --> 01:31:51.417
Dong's confession narrowed it down

01:31:51.501 --> 01:31:53.334
But something Zhang said was the key

01:31:53.792 --> 01:31:57.126
We checked out three apple orchards

01:31:57.334 --> 01:31:59.084
We then looked onto this one halfway up a hill

01:31:59.167 --> 01:32:00.542
This resort is 300 meters

01:32:00.692 --> 01:32:02.167
from our target

01:32:02.334 --> 01:32:04.542
Everything points to this location,

01:32:04.626 --> 01:32:06.792
but we don't know what to expect inside

01:32:06.876 --> 01:32:08.834
Just now Zhang confessed
there are three men inside

01:32:08.984 --> 01:32:10.459
with five guns

01:32:10.542 --> 01:32:12.584
The two hostages are being kept
on the building's east side

01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:15.084
He has no more bargaining chips,
so he should be telling the truth

01:32:15.167 --> 01:32:16.667
Let me go in first

01:32:16.792 --> 01:32:17.709
No, I'll go first

01:32:17.792 --> 01:32:20.084
Okay. Don't fight over it.
Both of you play it by ear

01:32:21.751 --> 01:32:24.334
I want to say something. Please hear me out

01:32:24.876 --> 01:32:26.126
Is it really worth it?

01:32:26.667 --> 01:32:30.376
You're a kidnapper.
The penalty for kidnapping is ten years

01:32:30.526 --> 01:32:33.501
But if you kill us, then you're a murderer

01:32:34.209 --> 01:32:36.084
You'll get the death penalty. Is it worth it?

01:32:36.167 --> 01:32:39.292
Say you kill us,
but then get shot by the police?

01:32:39.376 --> 01:32:40.834
Or by Zhang? Is it worth it?

01:32:43.459 --> 01:32:44.667
I have a better plan

01:32:44.751 --> 01:32:47.792
You set us free. Zhang gets his one million

01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:51.834
Tomorrow, I'll get the other two million
for you. I promise

01:32:52.042 --> 01:32:53.501
That works out best for everyone

01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:56.876
Turn off your walkie-talkies
- The hostage's safety is our priority

01:32:56.959 --> 01:32:58.626
Shoot to kill if a suspect raises a gun

01:32:58.792 --> 01:32:59.959
Be careful, everyone

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:02.501
We'll go through the woods.
The trees will cover us

01:33:02.959 --> 01:33:05.959
The suspect wants to talk
to whoever is going in first

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:11.084
I just want to remind you of something

01:33:11.167 --> 01:33:13.976
My buddies' guns are loaded.

01:33:14.126 --> 01:33:16.126
The first one to enter dies first

01:33:16.792 --> 01:33:18.042
A straight shot to the head

01:33:18.667 --> 01:33:19.917
Got it

01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:21.459
Thanks

01:33:30.501 --> 01:33:33.876
Remember what you said.
We're going to get him alive

01:33:42.334 --> 01:33:44.167
Hurry UP!

01:33:44.251 --> 01:33:45.417
Fatty?

01:33:46.792 --> 01:33:48.001
What are you doing?

01:33:48.084 --> 01:33:50.209
Hurry up! Ignore him!

01:33:50.292 --> 01:33:52.209
Hurry!
- He still has two million

01:33:54.417 --> 01:33:56.709
Don't hit him!

01:33:57.542 --> 01:34:00.376
Stop! Can everyone just stop?

01:34:01.792 --> 01:34:03.251
It's only death

01:34:11.584 --> 01:34:12.834
Cang, what are you doing?

01:34:13.126 --> 01:34:14.584
Sparing us some trouble later

01:34:27.667 --> 01:34:30.251
It's not time yet
- Don't give me that shit

01:34:30.334 --> 01:34:32.876
Zhang said 9pm. It's not time yet

01:34:32.959 --> 01:34:35.292
Put the gun down!

01:34:35.376 --> 01:34:37.292
Put it down!

01:34:37.501 --> 01:34:39.084
Hurry up! Stop stalling!

01:34:40.292 --> 01:34:41.376
At the same time

01:34:47.417 --> 01:34:49.292
Just accept it. This is your fate

01:37:42.167 --> 01:37:44.459
You haven't said a word since your rescue.

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:46.334
Why?

01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:51.751
You must have gone through
similar experiences

01:37:51.901 --> 01:37:53.126
as an actor

01:37:53.584 --> 01:37:57.084
Movies are make-believe. This is real

01:37:58.251 --> 01:37:59.626
It really happened

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.292
Thank you very much

01:38:04.292 --> 01:38:07.251
Thank you

01:38:40.751 --> 01:38:43.001
The flowers are for your wife.
No more fighting, please!

01:38:43.084 --> 01:38:45.876
No worries. <i>l'll</i> bury the hatchet

01:38:46.251 --> 01:38:47.376
Brother Wu

01:38:47.959 --> 01:38:49.334
this is my girlfriend

01:38:50.626 --> 01:38:55.334
Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you

01:39:09.251 --> 01:39:10.667
A new day begins

01:39:10.751 --> 01:39:12.792
Who knows what awaits us

01:39:15.001 --> 01:39:17.084
30", you're up early?

01:39:17.334 --> 01:39:19.876
Sorry, I've been so busy

01:39:26.542 --> 01:39:28.667
Now for the news

01:39:29.001 --> 01:39:31.501
Last night, Beijing police broke up
a kidnapping gang

01:39:31.584 --> 01:39:35.084
Five suspects were arrested
and two hostages rescued

01:39:35.417 --> 01:39:39.876
One hostage is said
to be a movie star surnamed Wu

01:39:39.959 --> 01:39:43.417
We'll stay on top of the news as it develops

01:39:47.376 --> 01:39:49.184
The People's Court of Beijing

01:39:49.334 --> 01:39:53.042
has made final judgement on Case #223

01:39:53.126 --> 01:39:55.209
Zhang Hua and two of his accomplices
are sentenced to death...

01:39:55.292 --> 01:39:58.542
for murder, kidnapping and the illegal
purchase, sale and possession of...

01:39:58.626 --> 01:40:00.834
firearms and ammunitions

01:40:00.917 --> 01:40:04.959
Two others are sentenced to life in prison
and a fixed term respectively

01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:08.167
Don't get too excited

01:40:10.626 --> 01:40:16.209
Mum, I've settled down. No more trouble-making

01:40:16.501 --> 01:40:22.667
Son, I feel so guilty for not raising you right

01:40:22.751 --> 01:40:29.251
No worries. Take care of yourself when I'm gone

01:40:30.459 --> 01:40:35.834
Don't act the same in your next life

01:40:40.126 --> 01:40:46.459
I wasn't one in this life,
but <i>I'll</i> be a filial son in the next

01:40:57.501 --> 01:40:58.417
My Son!

01:40:58.501 --> 01:41:00.459
Take this as my kowtowing to you!

01:41:01.334 --> 01:41:03.167
My Son!

01:41:21.001 --> 01:41:22.709
I told him he didn't have to come,

01:41:22.859 --> 01:41:24.209
but he insisted

01:41:33.167 --> 01:41:36.876
I don't know why, but I really wanted
to see you one last time

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:42.584
Our last opportunity for a little chat

01:41:44.167 --> 01:41:45.376
Yes

01:41:46.459 --> 01:41:49.042
But what to talk about?
You want to give me a lecture?

01:41:49.376 --> 01:41:50.834
Or let off some steam?

01:41:53.292 --> 01:41:56.167
There's a lot I wanted to say,

01:41:57.126 --> 01:41:59.792
but now that I'm here
I don't know where to begin

01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:03.334
People's lot in life can be so different

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.001
Your lot in life is really good

01:42:16.209 --> 01:42:18.751
Yes. My lot in life is good

01:42:19.305 --> 01:42:25.669
