00:49.468 --> 00:52.494
Once upon a time in the
land of Flutterfield,

00:52.570 --> 00:55.803
there lived a Butterfly Fairy
named Mariposa.

00:56.475 --> 00:58.500
She was the smartest fairy
in the land.

00:58.577 --> 01:00.909
She read every book
she could find.

01:01.112 --> 01:04.741
And the dashing Prince Carlos also
shared her love of reading.

01:06.151 --> 01:07.481
Then, one day,

01:07.552 --> 01:10.816
Mariposa discovered that the
magical lights in Flutterfield

01:10.922 --> 01:12.149
were growing dimmer.

01:12.222 --> 01:15.020
These lights protected Flutterfield
from the Skeezites,

01:15.092 --> 01:17.355
monsters who eat
Butterfly Fairies.

01:18.462 --> 01:20.452
The lights were going out
because Henna,

01:20.529 --> 01:24.090
an evil Butterfly Fairy, had poisoned
Queen Marabella,

01:24.166 --> 01:27.067
and it was the Queen's magic
that made the lights shine.

01:28.236 --> 01:31.900
So, Mariposa and her friends
flew to the Bewilderness

01:31.973 --> 01:33.771
on a quest for an antidote.

01:33.843 --> 01:38.175
But along the way, they faced peril
and danger of all kinds.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.315
When they finally arrived at the
Cave of Reflections,

01:41.384 --> 01:44.840
Mariposa proved her courage
and earned the antidote.

01:44.918 --> 01:45.976
When she did,

01:46.054 --> 01:49.046
her wings grew larger
and even more beautiful.

01:49.723 --> 01:51.954
Mariposa and her friends
returned to Flutterfield

01:52.026 --> 01:54.859
to discover the Skeezites
attacking the Royal Palace.

01:55.229 --> 01:59.131
Mariposa gave the antidote to the
Queen, who was instantly healed.

01:59.298 --> 02:03.428
The magical lights returned, forcing
Henna and the Skeezites to flee.

02:05.104 --> 02:08.664
Queen Marabella hailed Mariposa
and her friends as heroes,

02:08.741 --> 02:10.366
which they are to this day.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.717
Hey, Mariposa!

02:20.786 --> 02:22.083
Hello, Mariposa!

02:22.154 --> 02:23.142
Hi!

02:30.393 --> 02:32.021
Hey, Mariposa!

02:32.129 --> 02:33.390
Oh, hello!

02:33.697 --> 02:35.324
Morning, Mariposa.
Hi!

02:35.398 --> 02:36.388
Hey, Mariposa!

02:36.467 --> 02:37.524
Good morning.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.000
Thanks for the
suggestion on the book.

02:39.069 --> 02:41.469
Oh, no problem.
I'm glad you like it.

02:41.539 --> 02:43.437
Wait till you read the sequel.

02:43.572 --> 02:45.938
Mariposa. Excuse me.

02:46.241 --> 02:47.265
Yes.

02:47.342 --> 02:50.743
Sorry to bother you, but I was hoping
you might have a chance to say hello.

02:50.812 --> 02:52.110
My daughter's a big fan.

02:52.481 --> 02:53.708
Of mine?

02:53.781 --> 02:55.908
I know all about how
you and your friends

02:55.983 --> 02:59.111
got the big scary Skeezites
out of Flutterfield.

02:59.253 --> 03:02.745
Oh, it wasn't just me, there were
lots of fairies who helped.

03:02.823 --> 03:04.018
Willa helped.

03:05.159 --> 03:09.357
Is it true you've read every
book in Flutterfield?

03:09.730 --> 03:13.392
Well, not every one,
but there's still time.

03:14.302 --> 03:15.700
Will you sign my book?

03:16.970 --> 03:18.597
Really? Okay.

03:19.439 --> 03:22.202
And whenever you're looking
for a book recommendation,

03:22.274 --> 03:24.266
come by the Royal
Library in the palace.

03:24.577 --> 03:26.101
I'm there every day.

03:26.277 --> 03:29.714
I will, for sure!
Thanks so much, Mariposa!

03:29.982 --> 03:31.278
You're welcome.

03:31.349 --> 03:32.374
See you later.

03:32.451 --> 03:33.781
Bye!

03:34.353 --> 03:37.083
Hey! How come I never
get an autograph?

03:37.388 --> 03:39.288
Because you never have a pen!

03:39.657 --> 03:42.387
You must be the most
famous librarian ever.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.357
"Royal Historian. "

03:44.429 --> 03:46.692
And I chose the best
job in the world.

03:46.831 --> 03:51.096
I get to spend all day with the biggest
collection of books in Flutterfield.

03:51.468 --> 03:53.095
It's perfect.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.013
Easy, Zee.
I'm right here.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.069
What is it?

04:11.153 --> 04:13.280
The Queen?
Did she say why?

04:17.159 --> 04:20.992
That would be a surprise, since
it's not Mariposa's birthday.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.459
Let's go find out.

04:22.764 --> 04:23.889
Zee, lead the way!

04:53.892 --> 04:55.189
Zee!

04:55.860 --> 04:57.589
Huh?

05:01.465 --> 05:03.694
Mariposa.
Thank you for coming.

05:04.134 --> 05:05.965
Of course, Your Majesty.

05:06.537 --> 05:07.561
Prince Carlos.

05:07.805 --> 05:09.465
Good morning, Mariposa.

05:13.844 --> 05:15.471
Oh! Lord Gastrous.

05:18.247 --> 05:21.876
Mariposa, tell me, what do you
know about Crystal Fairies?

05:22.151 --> 05:24.483
The Crystal Fairies?
From Shimmervale?

05:24.654 --> 05:25.881
Crystal Fairies? Yuck!

05:25.955 --> 05:27.752
Well...
Huh?

05:27.857 --> 05:29.380
Their land is built
on an amazing

05:29.458 --> 05:31.948
natural energy source
called Crystallites,

05:32.026 --> 05:35.292
and the Crystallites heat and power
everything in their realm.

05:35.397 --> 05:37.796
See, Mother, I told you she'd be
the perfect choice.

05:37.933 --> 05:39.023
Hardly.

05:39.166 --> 05:42.067
She hasn't mentioned
that they're vicious, vile,

05:42.170 --> 05:45.264
and the sworn enemies
of the Butterfly Fairies.

05:45.340 --> 05:48.001
With all due respect,
Lord Gastrous,

05:48.075 --> 05:49.564
I don't believe
that to be true.

05:49.676 --> 05:51.075
Ah-ha! You see?

05:51.211 --> 05:52.508
Misinformation!

05:53.080 --> 05:56.845
I've been around long enough
to know who our enemies are.

05:57.049 --> 06:00.109
Mariposa, Crystal Fairies
are scary and cruel.

06:00.186 --> 06:01.346
Everyone knows that.

06:01.554 --> 06:04.044
Only because that's what
we've been led to believe.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.748
It's what's in our fairy tales.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.422
But the real history is different.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.551
Look.

06:11.730 --> 06:15.291
Centuries ago, Butterfly and
Crystal Fairies were allies.

06:15.467 --> 06:18.925
Then, the Crystal Fairy King
accused the Butterfly Fairies

06:19.136 --> 06:21.297
of trying to steal
their Crystallites.

06:21.372 --> 06:23.170
The Butterfly Fairies denied it,

06:23.241 --> 06:25.208
the Crystal Fairies
didn't believe them,

06:25.276 --> 06:28.040
and everyone got
angrier and angrier

06:28.112 --> 06:31.603
until the two sides declared
themselves eternal enemies,

06:31.715 --> 06:33.740
and vowed never
to have contact again.

06:34.384 --> 06:37.012
Okay, but what about the part
where the Crystal Fairies

06:37.086 --> 06:40.385
grind the Butterfly Fairies'
wings to make their bread?

06:40.622 --> 06:42.614
Where's the picture of that?

06:42.959 --> 06:45.189
You won't find it.
It never happened.

06:45.260 --> 06:46.784
Preposterous!

06:46.862 --> 06:51.299
Your Majesty, the girl has no
idea what she's talking about!

06:51.532 --> 06:52.693
But I do!

06:53.068 --> 06:54.091
Your Majesty,

06:54.168 --> 06:57.570
all the horrible stories about
Crystal Fairies are just that,

06:57.706 --> 06:58.934
stories.

06:59.806 --> 07:01.798
This is history.

07:02.075 --> 07:05.341
And it's exactly the thing on which
we should base our decisions.

07:05.413 --> 07:07.643
Research, not hearsay.

07:07.882 --> 07:08.871
I'm convinced.

07:09.249 --> 07:11.513
Mariposa, you shall
leave for Shimmervale

07:11.584 --> 07:13.575
as Flutterfield's
Royal Ambassador.

07:14.054 --> 07:16.522
You will live with the Royal Family
for one week,

07:16.589 --> 07:17.647
and prove that...

07:17.724 --> 07:20.420
...Butterfly Fairies and Crystal
Fairies can be friends.

07:20.493 --> 07:22.016
Huh?
What?

07:22.161 --> 07:23.924
But Crystal Fairies are dangerous!

07:24.263 --> 07:25.697
If Mariposa goes there,
she'll be...

07:25.765 --> 07:27.699
Welcomed as an honored guest.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.060
That's what King Regellius
assures me.

07:30.134 --> 07:32.899
The Crystal Fairies will love you,
Mariposa. I know it.

07:33.138 --> 07:35.867
But, who will look after
the Royal Library?

07:36.007 --> 07:37.440
Willa can manage that.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.699
She can?

07:38.776 --> 07:39.799
I can?

07:41.112 --> 07:43.376
Of course she can.
And I will help also.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.375
I...

07:46.016 --> 07:47.414
I'm sorry. I can't.

07:48.919 --> 07:50.682
Your Majesty.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.763
Mariposa!

08:31.058 --> 08:33.322
Ah, Willa told me
I'd find you here.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.650
Hello, Carlos.

08:37.496 --> 08:38.486
Ooh!

08:39.065 --> 08:40.965
Why won't you go
to Shimmervale?

08:41.234 --> 08:43.758
I don't think
I'm ambassador material.

08:44.202 --> 08:46.295
Oh, but you are
the smartest fairy I know.

08:46.406 --> 08:48.202
You've read every book
on Shimmervale.

08:48.273 --> 08:50.070
Yeah, I'm great with books.

08:50.142 --> 08:52.701
But making peace
with the Crystal Fairies?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.569
I can't do that.

08:54.745 --> 08:56.212
But I know you'll win them over.

08:56.548 --> 08:57.912
But what if I don't?

08:57.982 --> 09:00.644
What if I say or do the wrong thing?

09:01.153 --> 09:02.744
What if I make things worse?

09:02.987 --> 09:06.251
You won't. We all believe in you.
Just be yourself.

09:06.423 --> 09:10.085
And remember, the best way to
make a friend, is to be a friend.

09:11.195 --> 09:12.422
Hmm.

09:12.529 --> 09:15.520
Oh! I almost forgot. My mother
asked me to give this to you.

09:16.232 --> 09:17.357
Ooh.

09:20.636 --> 09:22.002
It's beautiful.

09:22.571 --> 09:23.766
It's a Flutter Flower.

09:23.839 --> 09:26.637
It's made from the most
precious magic of Flutterfield.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.573
Whenever you have doubts,
just take it out

09:29.745 --> 09:32.008
and it will remind you of us.

09:33.815 --> 09:35.009
I'll go.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.209
Please, thank
the Queen for me.

09:38.151 --> 09:40.517
You'll be welcomed on the
outskirts of Shimmervale.

09:40.587 --> 09:42.714
Guess I'll see you
when I get back, then.

09:43.123 --> 09:44.385
Bye, Carlos.

09:44.858 --> 09:46.053
Goodbye.

09:46.159 --> 09:47.421
And good luck!

09:48.496 --> 09:50.019
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

09:54.501 --> 09:57.594
Okay, Mondays, the new
manuscripts come in.

09:57.670 --> 10:00.798
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,
you need to lead the guided tours.

10:01.073 --> 10:03.940
On Wednesdays, the tapestries
get touched up and cleaned,

10:04.009 --> 10:06.500
and on Fridays,
we read to the elderly.

10:07.246 --> 10:08.405
Did you get all that?

10:08.479 --> 10:10.072
Yes. I think so.

10:10.248 --> 10:13.410
Uh, what was that thing you said?
After "Monday"?

10:13.718 --> 10:15.912
There! Is there
anything I forgot?

10:17.055 --> 10:19.353
Um... Your clothes?

10:19.857 --> 10:21.723
Oh, right.

10:22.326 --> 10:23.417
Hmm.

10:23.660 --> 10:24.649
I'm on it.

10:33.703 --> 10:35.000
Oh, Zee.

10:49.618 --> 10:50.778
Come on!

11:05.065 --> 11:06.223
Piece of cake.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.998
Thanks.
Wish me luck.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.662
Be careful, okay?

11:11.037 --> 11:12.062
I will!

11:13.506 --> 11:14.837
Good luck.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.908
Okay, Zee, we're ready to go!

11:17.410 --> 11:18.433
Zee?

11:19.245 --> 11:21.611
Looks like one of your books
doesn't want to go.

11:21.714 --> 11:22.702
Zee.

11:22.881 --> 11:25.406
You're not afraid of the
Crystal Fairies, are you?

11:26.451 --> 11:27.611
Mmm-mmm.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.343
Mmm-hmm.

11:29.421 --> 11:31.148
Zee, it'll be fine.

11:31.255 --> 11:34.782
There are no stories about
Crystal Fairies eating puffballs.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.689
Come on. Let's go
have an adventure!

12:02.085 --> 12:03.210
Ooh.

12:08.189 --> 12:09.281
Yay!

12:21.936 --> 12:23.459
Hello?

12:24.738 --> 12:26.102
Boo!

12:31.177 --> 12:32.769
Huh?

13:27.096 --> 13:29.153
Shimmervale; A History says,

13:29.263 --> 13:32.289
"Diplomats to Shimmervale
receive a grand welcome,

13:32.367 --> 13:35.665
"including a parade, marching band,
and fireworks. "

13:35.736 --> 13:36.633
Ooh.

13:37.063 --> 13:38.091
Ooh.

13:51.016 --> 13:52.745
This is the meeting spot, Zee!

14:02.795 --> 14:05.319
Hmm, we're right on time.

14:08.399 --> 14:10.390
Huh? Hmm.

14:17.241 --> 14:18.538
Is someone there?

14:21.812 --> 14:22.801
Hello?

14:25.015 --> 14:26.003
Don't hurt me!

14:27.049 --> 14:28.710
Of course we won't hurt you.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.551
I'm Mariposa, from Flutterfield,
and this is Zee.

14:34.223 --> 14:36.748
You're not going to hypnotize
me with your wicked magic,

14:36.858 --> 14:39.191
then lure me back to your dark,
dismal cave and...

14:40.695 --> 14:42.720
Um... No.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.456
Oh, goody!
I'm Talayla.

14:46.034 --> 14:49.025
Your butterfly wings
are so beautiful!

14:49.204 --> 14:50.865
Thanks, I like yours too.

14:51.338 --> 14:52.362
Ooh!

14:52.440 --> 14:53.839
Look! How cute.

14:53.907 --> 14:55.704
Is that your war beast?

14:56.543 --> 14:57.805
War beast?

14:57.878 --> 14:59.072
No.

14:59.313 --> 15:00.939
Then, yay! How cute!

15:03.584 --> 15:07.349
So, is this the grand welcome?

15:12.357 --> 15:13.949
Oh, that. Sorry.

15:14.025 --> 15:16.085
The flying band was too afraid
to come meet you.

15:18.498 --> 15:19.987
Ah. It's okay.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.157
Huh?

15:24.802 --> 15:28.102
Come on. I'll show you both
all around Shimmervale!

15:28.472 --> 15:30.406
I mean...

15:30.509 --> 15:32.942
In the name of his
Royal King Regellius,

15:33.043 --> 15:37.640
it is my privilege to give you an
official tour of our fair land.

15:38.115 --> 15:39.706
Let's go!

15:43.820 --> 15:44.808
Meh.

15:48.658 --> 15:51.490
Welcome to Shimmervale City.

16:03.438 --> 16:04.666
Ooh!

16:10.011 --> 16:12.410
And I see every
roof has a Crystallite,

16:12.915 --> 16:15.348
the main source of heat and
power here in Shimmer...

16:15.450 --> 16:17.246
That's my line.

16:17.317 --> 16:18.443
Sorry.

16:18.518 --> 16:21.510
As you can see, every roof
has a Crystallite,

16:21.721 --> 16:24.451
the main source of heat and power
here in Shimmervale.

16:24.557 --> 16:26.185
It's a Butterfly Fairy!

16:31.313 --> 16:32.152
Hmm?

16:32.598 --> 16:33.963
Follow me.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.628
Next stop, GlowWater Falls!

16:37.368 --> 16:38.358
Wait.

16:43.676 --> 16:44.868
Here it is.

16:44.942 --> 16:46.308
Historians say this...

16:46.377 --> 16:47.469
Historians say

16:47.544 --> 16:51.208
this is where Shimmervale's first
residents discovered Crystallites.

16:51.682 --> 16:53.014
Wow!

16:54.918 --> 16:58.820
I never thought I'd say this,
but pictures don't do it justice.

16:59.723 --> 17:01.623
Yup. It's why
we end the tour here.

17:05.662 --> 17:07.321
Zee? Are you okay?

17:10.232 --> 17:13.202
Aw, am I going too fast for you,
little puffer?

17:16.271 --> 17:19.105
And now to the palace,
where you'll be staying.

17:21.977 --> 17:23.467
Come on.

17:33.587 --> 17:35.020
Wow.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.426
The castle was built
over 4,000 years ago

17:46.499 --> 17:48.797
under the reign of
King Fremulous the Fourth.

17:50.303 --> 17:54.466
His wife, Queen Safrila, designed
much of what we still see today.

17:57.376 --> 17:58.435
Hey!

17:58.511 --> 17:59.568
Huh?

18:01.713 --> 18:03.077
Up here!

18:09.720 --> 18:10.708
Hi.

18:15.993 --> 18:17.550
Anu! You're scaring her!

18:19.729 --> 18:22.061
Ah, you're Mariposa, aren't you?

18:22.132 --> 18:23.428
The Butterfly Fairy?

18:23.534 --> 18:25.466
Yes.
I'm Catania.

18:25.535 --> 18:29.698
Oh, it must be so terrifying,
flying across Fairytopia to get here.

18:30.105 --> 18:31.697
Were you scared?

18:32.207 --> 18:34.869
Scared? I don't know,
it was more...

18:34.944 --> 18:37.276
Catania, away from the window!

18:37.579 --> 18:40.571
Ah, I've got to go.
Nice to meet you.

18:41.983 --> 18:43.245
Welcome to the kingdom.

18:46.888 --> 18:47.877
Hey!

18:54.261 --> 18:55.694
There you are.

18:55.762 --> 18:58.525
I thought I lost another
visitor on the tour.

18:58.732 --> 19:00.289
I'll never live that down.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.367
Anyhoo, let's show
you to your room.

19:05.104 --> 19:06.629
Zee! Come on!

19:20.352 --> 19:21.751
Ooh!

19:24.889 --> 19:25.912
Yo!

19:26.891 --> 19:27.879
Tah-dah!

19:28.926 --> 19:29.916
Cuckoo!

19:36.667 --> 19:37.998
And now...

19:38.836 --> 19:40.359
Tah-dah!

19:44.474 --> 19:45.872
Wow!

19:48.177 --> 19:49.405
It's...

19:52.147 --> 19:53.671
I decorated it myself.

19:53.749 --> 19:56.513
Really interesting.

19:57.419 --> 20:00.876
I based it on everything we Crystal
Fairies know about Butterfly Fairies.

20:01.389 --> 20:03.880
That was thoughtful.

20:04.226 --> 20:06.455
Do the trees in Flutterfield
really come alive,

20:06.527 --> 20:08.461
snatch the fairies in midair,
and devour them?

20:08.596 --> 20:10.029
What? No!

20:10.530 --> 20:11.828
These don't do that, do they?

20:11.899 --> 20:14.560
Nah, I couldn't figure out how
to make it work.

20:17.838 --> 20:21.169
I did put in hidden thorns, though!

20:21.240 --> 20:22.868
Just like home.

20:28.447 --> 20:31.143
And now it is my
extreme pleasure

20:31.216 --> 20:34.584
to invite you to meet
His Royal Highness King Regellius,

20:34.653 --> 20:36.917
and the Royal Princess Catania.

20:38.156 --> 20:39.680
Unless you want to stay here
and freshen up,

20:39.757 --> 20:41.088
you know, where it's familiar?

20:41.159 --> 20:44.560
No, uh, we would be honored to meet
the king and princess.

20:57.307 --> 20:58.467
Ready to meet the king?

20:58.709 --> 21:00.074
I think so.

21:04.548 --> 21:06.537
Please welcome Mariposa,

21:06.817 --> 21:10.149
Royal Ambassador
from Flutterfield!

21:19.361 --> 21:24.195
I introduce King Regellius and
Princess Catania of Shimmervale!

21:27.202 --> 21:28.190
Hey!

21:28.836 --> 21:29.963
"Hey"?

21:30.170 --> 21:33.037
Is that how you address
the Princess of Shimmervale?

21:33.340 --> 21:35.933
No. I, uh...

21:36.008 --> 21:39.307
I believe in Flutterfield it's
actually a term of deep respect.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.837
Isn't that right?

21:41.646 --> 21:44.080
Yes! Yes, it is.

21:45.485 --> 21:47.680
"Hey," Your Majesties.

21:48.054 --> 21:49.111
Hey.

21:51.556 --> 21:52.750
Hey.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.786
Hey.

21:57.729 --> 21:59.424
Is that thing growling at me?

21:59.698 --> 22:02.223
A beastly, "How are you?"
in Flutterfield.

22:02.601 --> 22:03.794
I see.

22:08.305 --> 22:09.430
Cuckoo!

22:10.274 --> 22:13.765
Clearly I have much to learn about
Butterfly Fairy customs.

22:14.912 --> 22:16.742
Let's repair to the
terrace for tea.

22:22.785 --> 22:24.720
Madam Ambassador.

22:28.690 --> 22:29.816
Come on, Sylvie.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.420
Hmm.

23:08.028 --> 23:09.550
Hey! Watch where
you're going!

23:09.627 --> 23:11.152
You almost made me
spill my smoothie.

23:12.798 --> 23:15.129
Carlos!
Good morning!

23:15.501 --> 23:17.365
It's afternoon, actually.

23:17.735 --> 23:19.497
Oops. I slept in.

23:20.004 --> 23:22.734
Then I stopped by Fluter's Bakery
for some Poof Pastries.

23:22.807 --> 23:23.795
Breakie?

23:24.142 --> 23:25.473
It's lunchtime.

23:26.411 --> 23:27.604
Oh.

23:27.678 --> 23:29.373
No breakfast for you then.

23:32.649 --> 23:33.843
Now, let's see.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.181
Today's shipment of books
has already come in.

23:36.253 --> 23:38.278
Check!
Inventory new books.

23:42.758 --> 23:45.226
This could take a while.

23:59.406 --> 24:00.669
Hmm.

24:07.614 --> 24:12.642
So, to defeat the Skeezites, your people
must be trained as warriors from birth.

24:12.753 --> 24:13.777
Oh, no.

24:13.854 --> 24:15.287
We're not warriors.

24:15.355 --> 24:19.086
I mean, we have warriors,
but we're a very peaceful people.

24:19.358 --> 24:20.348
More tea?

24:20.426 --> 24:21.450
Please.

24:21.527 --> 24:25.189
But I was under the impression
Butterfly Fairies were built for battle.

24:25.331 --> 24:29.391
The armored scales,
the vice-like pincers, the fire breath!

24:29.968 --> 24:31.993
Fire breath? Um...

24:32.070 --> 24:34.095
Ah... We actually don't
have any of those.

24:35.006 --> 24:36.099
Hmm.

24:42.847 --> 24:45.372
I love how the Crystallites
shimmer in the sun.

24:45.449 --> 24:46.643
Don't touch that!

24:47.217 --> 24:50.277
The Crystallites are only to
be touched by Crystal Fairies!

24:50.788 --> 24:52.515
Oh! Of course.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.384
I'm sorry, if I could just...

24:56.692 --> 24:57.990
Oh, excuse me.

24:58.094 --> 24:59.390
My word!

24:59.595 --> 25:00.995
Oh, no!

25:06.669 --> 25:07.692
Oh!

25:09.438 --> 25:12.167
I'm so sorry.
This is awful.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.401
Let me help.

25:13.475 --> 25:14.668
Ooh! My bad.

25:14.876 --> 25:16.002
Oh, sorry!

25:19.914 --> 25:21.745
Ah.

25:22.416 --> 25:23.975
Here, allow me.

25:25.152 --> 25:26.176
Thank you.

25:26.853 --> 25:28.184
Oh!

25:28.322 --> 25:29.653
Did I get you?

25:29.722 --> 25:30.747
Here, let me see.

25:30.825 --> 25:32.984
Please.
I prefer you didn't!

25:35.696 --> 25:40.132
Perhaps, Madam Ambassador,
it would be best if you simply sat down.

25:42.001 --> 25:44.730
And moved a bit farther
back from the table.

25:45.871 --> 25:47.997
Of course, Your Majesty.

25:49.441 --> 25:51.466
Perhaps, just a little farther.

25:53.512 --> 25:54.670
A bit more...

25:56.548 --> 25:57.605
More.

25:58.817 --> 26:00.249
Teeny bit farther.

26:01.852 --> 26:02.841
Perfect.

26:03.921 --> 26:05.890
I'm sorry. What?

26:06.390 --> 26:08.152
I said, thank you!

26:14.931 --> 26:16.194
Oh, no!

26:17.467 --> 26:20.401
This Royal Tea is over!

26:21.237 --> 26:22.328
Come, Catania!

26:28.577 --> 26:31.478
Well, that went better than expected.
Don't you think?

26:47.160 --> 26:49.287
Now is the time, Boris.

26:49.496 --> 26:52.090
Eight years of
planning my revenge.

26:52.232 --> 26:56.896
Eight years to hone my magic
and become even more powerful.

26:56.970 --> 26:59.494
Eight years of talk
and no action.

26:59.572 --> 27:01.335
When are we gonna get
to the revenging?

27:01.740 --> 27:03.833
Silence!
I need to concentrate.

27:13.719 --> 27:14.742
Yes.

27:14.819 --> 27:18.346
Yes! Look at it!
It's beautiful!

27:18.423 --> 27:19.514
Beautiful?

27:19.590 --> 27:22.558
Personally, I prefer things
to be shinier, you know?

27:22.693 --> 27:24.956
Sparkly, like a piece of jewelry,

27:25.063 --> 27:26.360
or a lake!

27:26.431 --> 27:29.831
That's really shiny,
with sun sparkling...

27:29.900 --> 27:32.060
Beautiful because it's
completely destroyed!

27:39.375 --> 27:42.401
Soon all of Shimmervale's
Crystallites

27:42.478 --> 27:45.241
will have had
their final glow.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.368
Can't sleep, Zee?

28:18.810 --> 28:20.539
I know. I couldn't
sleep either.

28:21.714 --> 28:24.148
There's just so much more to learn
about Shimmervale.

28:24.217 --> 28:26.115
I can't have anymore
tea disasters.

28:29.888 --> 28:30.912
Hmm.

28:30.988 --> 28:34.322
It says here that outsiders are forbidden
to touch a Crystallite,

28:34.726 --> 28:36.386
especially the Heartstone,

28:36.595 --> 28:39.461
which is the most powerful Crystallite
in Shimmervale.

28:39.797 --> 28:42.062
That's why the king
was so upset at tea.

28:45.568 --> 28:47.434
Sorry, Zee,

28:47.670 --> 28:49.036
but I'm not tired

28:49.106 --> 28:51.904
and this light just makes
me feel like I'm at home.

28:53.675 --> 28:55.109
Hey!

28:55.478 --> 28:56.706
Why, you...

28:57.080 --> 28:58.068
Oh!

29:11.727 --> 29:13.625
Good morning.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.155
Mariposa?

29:17.298 --> 29:18.286
Whoa!

29:21.269 --> 29:23.736
Ready for your introduction to the
people of Shimmervale?

29:23.970 --> 29:25.131
Huh?
Huh?

29:25.206 --> 29:27.173
We don't want to keep the king and
princess waiting,

29:27.407 --> 29:30.137
not to mention an entire kingdom
of Crystal Fairies!

29:30.477 --> 29:32.036
I'll never live that down.

29:32.879 --> 29:34.346
One minute!

29:40.486 --> 29:42.181
Come on.

29:59.537 --> 30:03.267
Mariposa, before our conversation was
interrupted yesterday,

30:03.507 --> 30:06.066
you were about to enlighten me as to
your weapons training

30:06.143 --> 30:07.667
and hand-to-hand
combat skills.

30:08.178 --> 30:09.770
Combat skills?

30:10.080 --> 30:13.174
Yes, the ones you used to fight the
Skeezites, of course.

30:13.683 --> 30:17.141
Oh. Well, it never really
came down to "battle. "

30:17.653 --> 30:19.415
Rayla, Rayna
and I met Zinzie,

30:19.755 --> 30:21.381
and then we all flew
to the Bewilderness,

30:21.456 --> 30:23.788
where we found clues
leading us to the mermaids

30:23.858 --> 30:25.689
who told us to fly east to the
Cave of Reflection...

30:25.760 --> 30:28.160
If you don't want to
tell me, just say so!

30:29.264 --> 30:31.697
I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to be evasive.

30:33.902 --> 30:35.698
Shimmervale City,
Your Highness.

30:43.343 --> 30:48.713
Please welcome Mariposa,
Royal Ambassador from Flutterfield!

30:56.989 --> 30:59.582
Well, it looks like
everyone is busy today.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.659
We're not busy!

31:04.796 --> 31:07.959
Well, it appears
my subjects are

31:08.166 --> 31:09.564
preoccupied.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.466
No, we're not!

31:12.604 --> 31:13.592
Oh!

31:13.672 --> 31:15.434
Your crown!

31:17.441 --> 31:18.839
She's attacking the King!

31:22.579 --> 31:23.807
I'm sorry!

31:24.347 --> 31:25.939
Your crown,
Your Majesty.

31:27.384 --> 31:30.547
Perhaps you beat the Skeezites by
tripping over them.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.055
There will be more
people here tomorrow.

31:44.299 --> 31:45.426
I'm sure of it.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.933
No, there won't!

31:50.372 --> 31:53.670
We're flying. We're flying.
We're flying.

31:59.712 --> 32:02.945
And mother thought two years in
art school was a waste of time.

32:04.051 --> 32:06.042
And we're stopping.

32:09.388 --> 32:11.481
A long time ago,
I forget how long,

32:11.558 --> 32:14.923
our fairy forefathers built Flutterfield
on top of a putrid swamp.

32:14.993 --> 32:16.325
Ah, but Miss?

32:16.461 --> 32:20.990
It says that Flutterfield was built
on a magnificent and exquisite garden.

32:22.601 --> 32:23.897
Yeah. Moving on.

32:23.968 --> 32:27.734
Okay, over here you'll see our
resident mural

32:28.440 --> 32:31.273
guy painting some
kind of picture?

32:31.542 --> 32:32.531
Ooh!

32:33.678 --> 32:36.840
Willa, you're not supposed to bring
the visitors back here.

32:37.113 --> 32:39.981
Please stand back,
this is a very fragile...

32:44.087 --> 32:45.282
...tapestry.

32:45.622 --> 32:47.055
Okay, people.
We're flying, we're flying.

32:47.123 --> 32:48.887
You're not very
good at this, are you?

32:48.958 --> 32:50.391
When's Mariposa coming back?

32:50.460 --> 32:51.893
Can I get a refund?

33:04.972 --> 33:05.962
Huh?

33:10.277 --> 33:11.836
Good morning, Zee!

33:13.948 --> 33:15.916
Ow, ow, ow.

33:16.183 --> 33:18.083
Today will be better, Zee.

33:19.019 --> 33:20.315
Oh!

33:21.122 --> 33:22.782
I just know it!

33:23.657 --> 33:25.248
Good morning!

33:25.357 --> 33:27.417
Here's your dress.

33:29.261 --> 33:30.524
My dress?

33:30.930 --> 33:34.387
The king has asked me to invite
you to the Annual Crystal Ball.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.598
Crystal Ball?
What's that?

33:37.002 --> 33:39.232
Just the biggest
social event of the year.

33:39.605 --> 33:41.698
Everyone comes to
the palace to celebrate!

33:42.073 --> 33:43.405
That's perfect.

33:43.474 --> 33:45.965
I'll win over the
citizens of Shimmervale

33:46.044 --> 33:48.342
and the king will see that
we can all get along.

33:48.947 --> 33:50.378
Do you know where
I can find the king?

33:50.949 --> 33:52.915
I want to thank him
for the invitation.

34:02.626 --> 34:05.925
Now where is my
third flying battalion?

34:07.463 --> 34:08.953
Ah, yes. Thank you.

34:10.166 --> 34:12.690
When you're responsible
for the kingdom, Catania,

34:12.766 --> 34:15.362
it will be important that
you position your guards

34:15.438 --> 34:19.237
at all the strategic locations from
which an enemy could attack.

34:19.674 --> 34:20.902
Oh, yes.

34:21.076 --> 34:22.303
Mmm-hmm.

34:23.712 --> 34:24.904
Your Majesty!

34:25.679 --> 34:27.147
Oh, Mariposa.

34:27.482 --> 34:31.248
Your Highness, thank you for
the invitation. I'm very honored.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.652
I wanted to know
if you want me to, well,

34:34.755 --> 34:36.347
address your
subjects at the ball.

34:36.724 --> 34:38.452
I bring greetings
from Queen Marabella,

34:38.525 --> 34:39.821
and I could simply say

34:39.891 --> 34:42.725
that everyone in Flutterfield
sends their good wishes.

34:48.234 --> 34:50.632
Let's see how it goes
at the ball, Mariposa,

34:50.702 --> 34:52.603
and perhaps you can
address the people.

34:53.170 --> 34:54.696
Thank you, Your Majesty.

35:03.548 --> 35:05.139
Zee! No!

35:06.184 --> 35:07.173
Oh, no!

35:09.887 --> 35:11.650
Now, look at what
you've done!

35:11.755 --> 35:14.383
I'm so sorry. Here,
let me help you pick those up.

35:18.027 --> 35:21.657
Honestly, I'm not even sure why
I agreed to this arrangement.

35:21.831 --> 35:23.629
Father, it was an accident.

35:24.235 --> 35:25.462
And those wings!

35:25.767 --> 35:27.065
They're a menace!

35:27.402 --> 35:28.870
Can't you do
anything about them?

35:29.472 --> 35:30.870
Do anything?

35:31.341 --> 35:34.538
Um, I guess I...

35:42.084 --> 35:44.051
Better.
Keep them that way.

35:45.987 --> 35:48.012
I'm sorry.
It's just he...

35:48.321 --> 35:49.482
Hmm.

35:49.557 --> 35:50.887
I'll talk to him.

35:51.158 --> 35:52.147
Father!

35:53.728 --> 35:55.218
Keep them this way?

35:56.197 --> 35:58.130
Ow.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.029
That could be difficult.

36:13.947 --> 36:15.846
You wanted to see me,
Your Majesty?

36:16.015 --> 36:17.641
Oh, yes.

36:18.049 --> 36:21.040
I want you to stay close to Mariposa
at the ball, Talayla.

36:21.353 --> 36:25.651
It's our most important celebration and
I don't want anything to go wrong.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.414
Yes, Sire.

36:29.961 --> 36:33.487
You see, Boris?
Patience is a virtue.

36:33.831 --> 36:37.027
Everyone in Shimmervale,
all in one place.

36:37.234 --> 36:40.533
Sharpen your talons,
my friend. We go tonight.

36:41.003 --> 36:44.735
Oh, I'm a-sharpenin'.
I'm a-sharpenin'.

37:02.624 --> 37:03.783
Sorry.

37:15.435 --> 37:16.734
Oh!

37:17.738 --> 37:19.103
Wow!

37:20.107 --> 37:22.074
Ooh!

37:25.612 --> 37:26.738
Did I get it right?

37:27.313 --> 37:28.438
You did this?

37:28.748 --> 37:30.773
You worked so hard
to learn about us,

37:30.850 --> 37:32.875
the least we could do
is return the favor.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.716
Hmm.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.021
Is it anything like home?

37:40.092 --> 37:41.320
It's perfect.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.026
I've actually been
reading up on Flutterfield

37:44.095 --> 37:45.653
since I found out
you were coming.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.993
You have?
I love to read.

37:48.065 --> 37:51.330
Sometimes I feel like I never want
to leave the palace.

37:51.434 --> 37:55.269
I'm perfectly happy spending
whole days lost in books.

37:55.339 --> 37:56.635
Me too!

37:56.706 --> 37:58.230
I've noticed.

37:59.376 --> 38:02.504
It's why I think
you'll like this.

38:04.213 --> 38:05.613
Wow!

38:07.117 --> 38:09.084
Catania! You did this?

38:09.386 --> 38:11.012
Well, I had some help.

38:15.791 --> 38:17.519
This is incredible!

38:18.459 --> 38:19.688
Oh! I can't believe it.

38:19.762 --> 38:21.992
Have you read this,
Flight of Fancy?

38:22.063 --> 38:23.723
It's one of my
all-time favorites!

38:23.797 --> 38:25.459
Mine too!

38:27.035 --> 38:28.934
Grab it. I want
to show you something.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.943
It's okay, Sylvie.
We can trust Mariposa.

38:50.389 --> 38:51.719
Follow us!

39:05.870 --> 39:08.997
This is my favorite
place to read.

39:09.640 --> 39:10.629
Wow.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.274
It's beautiful.

39:16.313 --> 39:18.303
Come on up!

39:22.585 --> 39:24.382
Isn't that a Crystallite?

39:24.754 --> 39:27.881
Only the most important one
in all the land.

39:27.956 --> 39:28.945
Come on!

39:36.264 --> 39:38.494
This is the Heartstone,
isn't it?

39:39.367 --> 39:42.529
It's the most powerful
Crystallite we have.

39:42.603 --> 39:44.332
I feel safe when I'm near it.

39:44.672 --> 39:46.299
Like nothing can harm me.

39:46.507 --> 39:48.532
Harm you?
Who would want to harm you?

39:49.509 --> 39:53.310
Um, it must be hard being away
from Flutterfield.

39:53.380 --> 39:54.368
Do you miss it?

39:54.448 --> 39:58.577
A little, but I'm really enjoying getting
to explore Shimmervale.

39:59.451 --> 40:02.216
I can't wait to see
GlowWater Falls again.

40:02.288 --> 40:05.314
I... I haven't
been there in years.

40:05.524 --> 40:07.151
You're kidding. Years?

40:07.961 --> 40:09.188
Since I was eight.

40:09.963 --> 40:11.054
Why not?

40:11.130 --> 40:12.496
I don't know.

40:12.565 --> 40:13.996
Let's go now.

40:14.066 --> 40:17.091
Now? You just said you haven't
been there in years.

40:17.168 --> 40:18.294
Don't you miss it?

40:19.170 --> 40:20.433
A lot.

40:20.638 --> 40:22.630
But the Crystal Ball
is this afternoon.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.307
We need time to get ready.

40:24.374 --> 40:27.036
We'll be quick. We'll be back
in two wingflaps.

40:29.846 --> 40:32.314
Okay, just for a little bit.

40:34.050 --> 40:37.679
I understand, Sylvie.
But you'll be right there with me.

41:09.016 --> 41:10.108
Wow.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.316
You think this is amazing?

41:14.388 --> 41:15.377
Follow me.

41:37.876 --> 41:41.868
I didn't think getting closer could
possibly make it any more amazing but...

41:41.947 --> 41:43.743
It did!

41:45.049 --> 41:46.607
Ooh!

41:50.119 --> 41:51.780
Have you ever skipped
Rainbow Rocks?

41:51.856 --> 41:55.291
How would I have ever
skipped Rainbow Rocks?

41:59.629 --> 42:01.119
Whoa.

42:01.763 --> 42:02.787
Oh!

42:02.866 --> 42:03.855
You try.

42:09.304 --> 42:10.293
Whoo-hoo!

42:12.174 --> 42:13.163
You're a natural!

42:41.767 --> 42:44.668
I've missed this place.

42:44.737 --> 42:46.364
Why has it been so long?

42:46.772 --> 42:49.206
Does it have anything
to do with why you don't fly?

42:57.915 --> 43:00.543
It's okay, you don't have to
talk about it if you don't want to.

43:01.419 --> 43:03.614
No, I do want to.

43:06.524 --> 43:07.682
I was eight years old.

43:11.795 --> 43:14.319
My father and I were
having a picnic

43:16.466 --> 43:18.696
when we saw something
down below.

43:22.538 --> 43:24.130
It was an old woman.

43:24.206 --> 43:25.730
She wasn't from Shimmervale,

43:25.807 --> 43:28.139
but she was poking around
the Crystallites.

43:40.788 --> 43:42.983
My father confronted her.

43:43.057 --> 43:44.684
She asked for a Crystallite.

43:44.758 --> 43:48.626
I knew what my father
would say. He told me all the time.

43:48.696 --> 43:51.221
"Our responsibility
is to the Crystal Fairies.

43:51.298 --> 43:53.822
"If we let other creatures
have Crystallites,

43:53.901 --> 43:56.960
"we could end up without enough
for our own subjects. "

43:57.036 --> 43:59.095
So your father said no.

43:59.172 --> 44:00.298
Mmm-hmm.

44:00.373 --> 44:01.704
What did the old woman do?

44:03.109 --> 44:04.098
Well...

44:04.477 --> 44:07.343
You dare deny the Gwyllion?

44:13.952 --> 44:18.081
I can't move!

44:18.555 --> 44:23.117
You had your chance. Now you
owe me all your Crystallites.

44:23.193 --> 44:24.752
Daddy!

44:26.297 --> 44:27.423
Catania, go back!

44:27.630 --> 44:31.464
Even more precious to you.

44:46.482 --> 44:48.848
Say goodbye to your little one.

44:57.025 --> 45:01.519
Madam? Uh, Mistress?
Uh, Gwyllion? Look out!

45:02.229 --> 45:04.858
Gah! My spell
was too weak.

45:04.931 --> 45:06.023
Get him!

45:06.099 --> 45:08.191
I'm a-gettin' him.
I'm a-gettin' him.

45:16.643 --> 45:18.405
Hey, watch your hands,
would ya?

45:18.878 --> 45:19.868
Oh!

45:20.079 --> 45:21.102
Let me go!

45:21.179 --> 45:22.374
You're mine now!

45:23.248 --> 45:24.580
Not if I can help it!

45:24.650 --> 45:26.743
Get off of me!

45:27.119 --> 45:28.710
Give me back my daughter!

45:29.055 --> 45:30.044
No!

45:35.926 --> 45:36.951
My staff!

45:39.097 --> 45:40.257
Take her!

45:41.398 --> 45:43.490
Daddy!

45:43.833 --> 45:45.494
Catania!

45:45.769 --> 45:47.396
Got it!

46:04.520 --> 46:09.388
You treat me with such disrespect?
You will regret this!

46:10.324 --> 46:13.225
Yeah! You mess with us,
we'll mess with you, eh?

46:14.128 --> 46:17.030
Ah, hey! Wait up! Gwyllion!

46:22.437 --> 46:23.959
Both my wings were broken.

46:24.505 --> 46:27.065
They healed,
but I haven't flown since.

46:27.674 --> 46:29.506
What happened
to the Gwyllion?

46:29.577 --> 46:30.565
She never came back.

46:31.343 --> 46:33.141
Are you worried she will?

46:33.213 --> 46:35.373
My father worries about it a lot.

46:35.447 --> 46:37.609
It's the real reason
he allowed you to come.

46:38.450 --> 46:40.884
He wants advice
on fighting the Gwyllion.

46:40.953 --> 46:43.115
But he could have just asked
Queen Marabella.

46:43.189 --> 46:44.850
I'm sure she would have...
No.

46:44.924 --> 46:47.517
He doesn't trust
Butterfly Fairies enough for that.

46:49.027 --> 46:50.755
Do you?

46:51.629 --> 46:52.790
Yes.

46:53.798 --> 46:55.323
I want you to have this.

46:57.935 --> 47:00.802
Catania, I... I can't.

47:00.904 --> 47:01.928
With our history,

47:02.006 --> 47:05.907
no Butterfly Fairy should ever take
a Crystallite from Shimmervale.

47:05.976 --> 47:07.671
You're not taking it.

47:07.744 --> 47:08.733
It's a gift.

47:09.846 --> 47:10.835
Oh!

47:11.580 --> 47:14.606
Thank you. I have
something for you too.

47:17.254 --> 47:18.618
It's so pretty!

47:19.188 --> 47:21.019
It's a Flutter Flower.

47:21.090 --> 47:23.718
I thought I needed it
to remind me of home.

47:23.792 --> 47:26.454
Maybe after I leave,
it can remind you of me.

47:27.129 --> 47:28.118
Oh!

47:28.730 --> 47:29.719
Thank you.

47:30.699 --> 47:31.687
Huh?

47:34.903 --> 47:35.891
Whoa!
Whoa!

47:40.108 --> 47:43.201
The Crystal Ball!
We need to go get ready!

47:44.111 --> 47:45.908
Whoo-hoo!

47:55.922 --> 47:58.220
My wings feel like they've been
flapping for days.

47:58.723 --> 48:00.589
Oh, it's been a long week.

48:00.660 --> 48:02.024
But I think we did it.
Mmm.

48:02.093 --> 48:03.526
I think you're right.

48:03.595 --> 48:06.825
Mariposa's gonna be so impressed.
This wasn't so hard.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.057
Now, how did the reading
to the elderly go?

48:09.568 --> 48:11.364
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.

48:12.938 --> 48:14.199
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

48:27.217 --> 48:28.276
Uh, come in.

48:30.353 --> 48:32.253
Oh, no!

48:32.322 --> 48:34.482
What's wrong?
I came to get you for the ball,

48:34.556 --> 48:35.784
and you're not even ready!

48:35.857 --> 48:37.051
Sure I am.

48:38.228 --> 48:40.628
But, but...
You're not beshimmered!

48:40.996 --> 48:41.984
Hmm?

49:04.317 --> 49:06.377
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

49:15.628 --> 49:16.617
Ooh!

49:24.502 --> 49:29.166
We do this in Flutterfield too,
only we call it befluttering!

49:30.808 --> 49:32.207
Bye.
Thank you.

49:37.281 --> 49:38.408
What do you think?

49:38.548 --> 49:39.537
Whoa!

49:41.052 --> 49:43.383
I'll work on it on the
way to the Crystal Ball.

50:11.679 --> 50:14.045
Wow.

50:14.148 --> 50:15.137
Ooh!

50:25.525 --> 50:26.514
Uh-oh.

50:32.832 --> 50:36.791
Oh, no! How can you enjoy
the ball if you can't fly?

50:36.902 --> 50:38.267
I know how.

50:41.406 --> 50:42.771
Your wings!

50:42.841 --> 50:45.969
If you have to fold down
your wings, I will too.

50:46.078 --> 50:47.704
What do you think?

50:48.246 --> 50:49.872
Beautiful.

50:49.947 --> 50:53.815
Thank you. My pleasure,
Your Ambassadoress.

50:54.218 --> 50:56.652
Oops!
Still working on that.

51:07.697 --> 51:10.928
Just an intimate gathering with
a couple of close friends?

51:11.000 --> 51:14.196
I told you. Everyone comes
to the Crystal Ball.

51:14.303 --> 51:16.464
I'd be surprised
if anyone isn't here.

51:24.179 --> 51:26.443
What is it?
Mmm, nothing.

51:26.515 --> 51:30.450
It's just, I always
loved dancing, until...

51:32.853 --> 51:34.082
So, we'll dance!

51:34.154 --> 51:35.985
But I don't...
Take us down please, Sylvie!

51:42.129 --> 51:43.118
Oh!

51:43.864 --> 51:45.353
Wow!

51:46.699 --> 51:48.132
Caramel toffee dumpling?

51:58.778 --> 51:59.767
Huh?

52:07.818 --> 52:08.808
Ew!

52:18.596 --> 52:20.289
Let's dance!

52:20.363 --> 52:22.423
But we're the only
ones down here.

52:22.599 --> 52:24.031
What if everyone stares?

52:24.100 --> 52:26.466
What if they do?
Come on, it's fun!

52:52.326 --> 52:54.487
You're right, this is fun!

52:55.061 --> 52:56.050
Told you!

52:57.264 --> 52:58.252
Huh?

53:10.976 --> 53:12.534
Oh! Look at that.

53:12.912 --> 53:13.901
What are they doing?

53:51.681 --> 53:52.669
Whoa!

53:53.481 --> 53:54.471
Oh, no.

53:54.550 --> 53:57.576
It's fine.
Now I know how it feels.

54:01.321 --> 54:03.415
That Butterfly Fairy
has a Crystallite!

54:04.592 --> 54:06.457
She must have stolen it!

54:06.928 --> 54:07.952
What? No!

54:08.028 --> 54:09.791
I knew we couldn't trust them!

54:09.963 --> 54:12.761
Look out for her fire breath!

54:17.970 --> 54:19.097
Enough!

54:23.209 --> 54:25.644
Mariposa,
you stole a Crystallite,

54:26.579 --> 54:28.604
after we welcomed you.

54:28.681 --> 54:30.273
And trusted you.

54:30.348 --> 54:31.646
No, Your Highness.

54:31.717 --> 54:33.480
I gave it to her!

54:33.553 --> 54:35.349
We were at GlowWater Falls
earlier and...

54:35.420 --> 54:38.117
You went to GlowWater Falls
unprotected?

54:38.190 --> 54:40.123
I know.
But Mariposa and I...

54:40.192 --> 54:42.250
She's a Butterfly Fairy,

54:42.327 --> 54:46.456
and in no position to know what's
best for a Crystal Fairy Princess!

54:46.530 --> 54:48.157
We weren't doing
anything wrong.

54:48.232 --> 54:50.632
I understand why you're
so protective, but...

54:50.701 --> 54:52.362
You know nothing!

54:52.436 --> 54:55.462
You don't know what it's like to be
responsible for a kingdom.

54:55.539 --> 54:59.771
You don't know how to protect us,
so we have to protect ourselves.

54:59.842 --> 55:01.741
Leave! Immediately!

55:03.279 --> 55:05.543
Leave? The ballroom?

55:05.615 --> 55:08.641
Leave Shimmervale!
And never come back!

55:08.850 --> 55:09.874
Father!

55:09.953 --> 55:11.647
Not now, Catania.

55:13.021 --> 55:15.081
As you wish, Your Majesty.

55:30.071 --> 55:32.539
But Father, I gave it to her!

55:32.773 --> 55:36.833
Even more reason to separate
you from an obviously bad influence.

55:37.645 --> 55:38.633
Ugh.

55:51.023 --> 55:54.823
It's all right, people.
The Butterfly Fairy threat is over.

55:55.327 --> 55:58.057
Smile! Dance! Enjoy!

56:13.211 --> 56:14.905
I don't know what's worse.

56:14.978 --> 56:19.209
That I failed, or that I have to go home
and admit it to people who believed in me.

56:21.685 --> 56:23.208
What is that?

56:28.024 --> 56:30.185
I thought everyone
was already at the ball?

56:35.698 --> 56:37.427
We can't just go.

56:37.600 --> 56:39.226
What if it's dangerous?
What if...

56:41.135 --> 56:42.501
What if it's the Gwyllion?

56:46.940 --> 56:47.930
Zee!

56:51.812 --> 56:54.746
I know the king told us to leave,
but we have to warn them.

56:55.315 --> 56:56.304
Uh-uh.

56:57.584 --> 57:01.212
Zee! We have to help the Crystal Fairies.
They're our friends.

57:04.357 --> 57:07.348
Catania's our friend.
And Sylvie.

57:07.426 --> 57:10.225
Are you going to tell me
that Anu isn't a friend?

57:14.733 --> 57:17.861
If the king and the other Crystal Fairies
aren't our friends now,

57:17.936 --> 57:21.200
well, I'm going to be a friend when
they need one most.

57:39.622 --> 57:43.752
Shimmervale, your day of reckoning
has finally come.

57:51.700 --> 57:54.964
Whoa! You're so wicked!

58:27.532 --> 58:28.522
Ahh.

58:38.877 --> 58:43.280
Well, look what
we have here, Boris.

58:43.848 --> 58:47.146
Oh, so shiny.

58:47.384 --> 58:50.513
Not for long!

59:26.587 --> 59:31.286
Ugh! I don't understand? He's the
one who doesn't understand, Anu.

59:46.438 --> 59:48.133
No.

59:49.842 --> 59:51.002
It can't be!

01:00:02.819 --> 01:00:03.809
What?

01:00:05.088 --> 01:00:06.988
Oh, no.
Catania!

01:00:07.058 --> 01:00:08.047
Mariposa?

01:00:08.626 --> 01:00:11.151
I think it's the Gwyllion!
She's putting out all the Crystallites!

01:00:11.229 --> 01:00:15.561
If she turns all the Crystallites
to rock, Shimmervale will freeze!

01:00:32.113 --> 01:00:35.105
Father! No!

01:00:53.767 --> 01:00:54.892
Gwyllion!

01:00:54.967 --> 01:00:58.699
One Crystallite!
That's all it would have taken.

01:00:58.772 --> 01:01:01.740
Stop, Gwyllion!
Have mercy on us!

01:01:02.108 --> 01:01:07.909
Yes, I will show you the same
mercy you showed me.

01:01:10.949 --> 01:01:15.544
Now witness as I destroy
your most precious stone of all!

01:01:19.424 --> 01:01:20.856
The Heartstone!

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:22.291
Huh?

01:01:22.359 --> 01:01:23.793
The Heartstone is like a candle,

01:01:23.862 --> 01:01:26.694
if we keep it lit, we can re-light all
the other Crystallites.

01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:31.399
The Gwyllion!

01:01:35.505 --> 01:01:37.200
She's going to get to it first!

01:01:37.273 --> 01:01:38.466
What do we do now?

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.102
We do what your father did.
We find a way to break her magic staff.

01:01:42.512 --> 01:01:44.502
But how do we...

01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:47.275
You guys are lousy hiders, eh?

01:01:52.721 --> 01:01:53.709
Catania!

01:01:59.994 --> 01:02:02.895
You're not gonna get away
from me this time, Princess!

01:02:02.963 --> 01:02:04.262
We have to do something.

01:02:07.001 --> 01:02:07.989
Oh, yeah! Oh!

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:15.631
Shimmervale, for your selfishness
I leave you with nothing!

01:02:35.226 --> 01:02:36.214
Sylvie!

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:37.283
Whoa!

01:02:46.671 --> 01:02:48.433
Oh, yeah, right?

01:02:48.505 --> 01:02:49.904
Yeah!

01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:51.907
What?

01:02:51.975 --> 01:02:52.963
Hey!

01:02:57.481 --> 01:02:59.312
What?

01:03:10.492 --> 01:03:11.618
Are you all right?

01:03:11.726 --> 01:03:14.058
I am, but Sylvie's wing is hurt.

01:03:14.128 --> 01:03:16.529
She'll be okay, she just can't fly.

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:22.491
Oh, no!

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:27.267
Catania?
Fly with me.

01:03:27.374 --> 01:03:30.343
I can't. I don't fly.
And it's the Gwyllion.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:32.641
You can do this,
Catania. Be brave.

01:03:33.046 --> 01:03:35.139
I'm not brave.
I'm scared.

01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:37.638
I can't.

01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:40.408
Stay here.

01:03:44.289 --> 01:03:46.813
Of course. Go.
Thank you.

01:03:50.362 --> 01:03:53.957
I can feel it!

01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:55.896
Not too much longer.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.059
Gwyllion! Stop!

01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:12.714
Boris! Get her!

01:04:26.795 --> 01:04:28.524
Boris, get them!

01:04:34.068 --> 01:04:35.592
Nice try, puffballs!

01:04:36.604 --> 01:04:38.935
Yeah, you better run! Ha!

01:04:39.372 --> 01:04:42.536
Well done, Boris.

01:04:58.791 --> 01:04:59.781
No!

01:05:01.494 --> 01:05:03.984
Mariposa! No!

01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:10.491
Huh?

01:05:25.849 --> 01:05:28.817
No more interruptions!

01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:37.152
It's happening!
It's happening!

01:05:39.194 --> 01:05:40.355
No!

01:05:41.463 --> 01:05:42.452
Catania!

01:05:47.401 --> 01:05:49.870
You won't stop me
this time, little one.

01:05:51.173 --> 01:05:54.369
Boris, help me!

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.098
You made it!

01:06:23.168 --> 01:06:26.467
Not fast enough.
It's too late. Look!

01:06:29.407 --> 01:06:31.466
It's so cold.

01:06:33.344 --> 01:06:34.743
Catania, look!

01:06:38.416 --> 01:06:39.541
The Flutter Flower.

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:45.816
Hmm, I wonder.

01:06:55.331 --> 01:06:56.320
Huh?
Huh?

01:06:57.968 --> 01:06:59.763
I thought maybe...

01:07:01.971 --> 01:07:04.064
Keep holding it
close to the Heartstone!

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:12.935
It's working!

01:07:48.313 --> 01:07:50.747
The other Crystallites!

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:55.611
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:59.788
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:08:00.491 --> 01:08:01.923
Your wings.

01:08:02.191 --> 01:08:03.181
Your wings.

01:08:04.193 --> 01:08:05.592
Ooh!
Ooh!

01:08:24.944 --> 01:08:26.174
Father!

01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:27.970
Catania!

01:08:30.283 --> 01:08:34.653
You're flying!
And your wings, they're beautiful!

01:08:35.121 --> 01:08:36.520
Thank you.

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:40.185
I'm so, so proud of you.

01:08:41.062 --> 01:08:42.823
And you, Mariposa,

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.920
I owe you an apology.

01:08:45.799 --> 01:08:47.163
I misjudged you.

01:08:47.701 --> 01:08:48.689
I was wrong.

01:08:50.636 --> 01:08:52.968
Mistress, come on!
Get up, eh?

01:08:53.037 --> 01:08:55.768
We still got a chance!
You can do this!

01:08:58.408 --> 01:09:00.742
My staff!
Where's my staff?

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:04.946
It's gone, Gwyllion. Just like you'll be
when I'm done with you.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.207
Any last words?

01:09:07.286 --> 01:09:09.617
Father, no!
You mustn't harm her.

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:12.656
What? Remember why
all this happened.

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:16.019
The Gwyllion asked us
for one Crystallite.

01:09:16.095 --> 01:09:20.393
One. And we have so many,
but we said no.

01:09:20.462 --> 01:09:22.658
And that gives her
the right to destroy us?

01:09:22.866 --> 01:09:27.029
No, not at all. But destroying
her isn't right either.

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:29.968
What do you
suggest we do?

01:09:30.538 --> 01:09:32.769
What we should have done
in the first place.

01:09:39.682 --> 01:09:41.046
She's being a friend,

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:44.349
and maybe making one too.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:54.220
I'm giving you your freedom,
and a chance to start over.

01:09:54.963 --> 01:09:58.955
I know that's not always easy,
so maybe this will help.

01:10:01.835 --> 01:10:06.738
You... You're giving me a Crystallite?
After everything I did?

01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.438
I'm righting a wrong.

01:10:10.876 --> 01:10:11.866
I...

01:10:12.878 --> 01:10:14.779
I don't know
what to say.

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:19.313
Oh!
Oh!

01:10:28.526 --> 01:10:29.585
Thank you.

01:10:30.362 --> 01:10:32.556
I hope I can live up
to your faith in me.

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:36.192
You're kidding me, right?
Come on, we had 'em!

01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:39.201
You changed.
You used to be cool.

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:44.130
Come, my pet.
We have much to think about.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.943
Hey, if you don't want your shiny
things any more, can I have 'em?

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:54.583
You may be a child,

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.551
but in some ways you're wiser
than I'll ever be.

01:10:58.286 --> 01:10:59.549
Thank you, Father.

01:11:01.255 --> 01:11:02.382
Aww!

01:11:07.995 --> 01:11:10.395
I would like to repay your kindness.

01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:12.463
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:11:13.267 --> 01:11:17.226
Hmm. There is one thing
you can do for me.

01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:46.986
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:55.539 --> 01:11:58.007
Mother, this is King Regellius
of Shimmervale.

01:11:58.742 --> 01:12:02.075
King Regellius, my mother,
Queen Marabella of Flutterfield.

01:12:05.081 --> 01:12:06.070
Your Highness.

01:12:06.984 --> 01:12:09.008
I mean, "Hey!"

01:12:09.084 --> 01:12:10.609
Uh, hey?

01:12:11.353 --> 01:12:13.254
It's an honor to
meet you, Your Highness.

01:12:13.489 --> 01:12:16.286
You're not concerned
about my fire breath?

01:12:16.491 --> 01:12:20.427
Your Majesty, I am ashamed
that I ever thought...

01:12:20.695 --> 01:12:23.391
Our myths about you
were just as silly.

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:24.865
But it's all in the past now.

01:12:24.933 --> 01:12:26.627
It's a privilege to have you here.

01:12:26.967 --> 01:12:28.559
And I wanted to give you this.

01:12:29.003 --> 01:12:31.198
An offering of peace and goodwill.

01:12:32.106 --> 01:12:37.873
Is that a Crystallite? It's even more
beautiful than Mariposa described.

01:12:37.944 --> 01:12:39.640
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:12:41.147 --> 01:12:42.409
May I have this dance?

01:12:42.782 --> 01:12:44.943
Why, yes, I'd love to.

01:12:52.725 --> 01:12:54.692
No way!

01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:56.283
Watch! Ready?

01:12:56.361 --> 01:12:57.350
Ready.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:05.563
Seriously? You knocked the king's crown
off his head with your wing?

01:13:05.637 --> 01:13:07.696
Whoa!

01:13:07.772 --> 01:13:09.602
Well, it was an accident!

01:13:09.674 --> 01:13:11.800
I've never seen
his face that red.

01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:16.209
I have. But not since I accidentally
put lava sauce in his fluffle muffins.

01:13:16.313 --> 01:13:17.872
Ew!

01:13:18.582 --> 01:13:20.641
I'll never live that down.

01:13:21.384 --> 01:13:24.352
I almost forgot. How'd everything
go at the Royal Library?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.846
Not much trouble, I hope?

01:13:26.022 --> 01:13:27.079
Um...

01:13:27.156 --> 01:13:31.320
Are you kidding? It was a breeze.
No trouble at all.

01:13:31.427 --> 01:13:33.361
Hey! There's that
awful tour guide.

01:13:33.429 --> 01:13:34.759
We want our money back.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:38.128
Uh-oh. I have to,
uh, freshen up.

01:13:39.534 --> 01:13:41.297
Hey! Come back here!

01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:48.771
I just wanted to tell you again

01:13:48.876 --> 01:13:51.902
how impressed I am by everything
you accomplished.

01:13:52.311 --> 01:13:55.544
Thank you, Carlos. I couldn't have done it
without the Flutter Flower.

01:13:57.383 --> 01:13:58.578
Care to dance?

01:13:59.318 --> 01:14:00.343
I'd love to.

01:14:13.965 --> 01:14:15.432
See. What did I tell ya?

01:14:16.102 --> 01:14:17.500
Made for each other.

01:14:18.236 --> 01:14:21.330
Well, I can see clearly

01:14:21.406 --> 01:14:25.604
that my ideas of the Crystal Fairies
were farfetched indeed!

01:14:25.677 --> 01:14:28.111
You are in no way
vicious or vile.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.141
Why thank you,
Lord Gastrous.

01:14:30.915 --> 01:14:31.903
Boo!

01:14:35.219 --> 01:14:36.277
Hmm. Right.

01:14:36.352 --> 01:14:38.820
Oh, I love this song.
Do you dance?

01:14:39.422 --> 01:14:40.412
I do now.

01:14:40.623 --> 01:14:41.647
Then come on!

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.786
You want to get your groove on to this,
Lord Gastrous?

01:14:45.261 --> 01:14:47.729
What? No. I, uh, never...

01:15:29.134 --> 01:15:30.123
Oh!

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.108
