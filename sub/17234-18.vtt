WEBVTT

00:01.492 --> 00:03.105
<i>Previously on "Nashville"...</i>

00:03.106 --> 00:04.854
Can we just at least
talk about what happened?

00:04.855 --> 00:06.135
It was a mistake.

00:06.136 --> 00:09.385
Right now, my association
with you could hurt me.

00:09.386 --> 00:10.443
What is she doing?

00:10.444 --> 00:12.884
Rayna signed me to Highway 65.

00:12.885 --> 00:14.258
Why don't you come open up for me?

00:14.259 --> 00:15.730
Deacon! You have to say yes!

00:15.731 --> 00:17.374
Your hobbies are getting
in the way of your homework.

00:17.375 --> 00:18.864
Music isn't a hobby to me!

00:18.865 --> 00:20.036
Any chance you're available?

00:20.037 --> 00:21.591
- For producing
your album? - Mm-hmm.

00:21.592 --> 00:23.794
Scarlett: I would rather not go
back out on the road right now.

00:23.795 --> 00:24.927
<i>I'll never expose you,</i>

00:24.928 --> 00:27.914
but it won't be long before
the rumors get to Jeff.

00:27.915 --> 00:29.290
Will you marry me?

00:35.319 --> 00:37.671
I can't believe we're barely
in the top five most-added.

00:37.672 --> 00:38.993
Came out of the gate strong.

00:38.994 --> 00:40.835
Just slipped into light
rotation in key markets

00:40.836 --> 00:42.387
once word got out you signed Juliette.

00:42.388 --> 00:43.714
'Cause we're being blacklisted.

00:43.715 --> 00:46.324
Country radio's not quick to
forgive controversial artists.

00:46.325 --> 00:48.968
If we fall off the charts, it
could derail the whole album.

00:48.969 --> 00:51.269
It doesn't help that Jeff Fordham's
throwing every Edgehill dollar

00:51.270 --> 00:53.510
trying to get Will
Lexington more radio play.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.586
[Sighs] Well, let's hope this live stream

00:55.587 --> 00:58.242
makes up for the fact
that we don't have a dime.

00:59.565 --> 01:02.109
[Sighs] Hey.

01:02.110 --> 01:03.824
Sounded good. Oh, thank you.

01:03.825 --> 01:05.370
We're trying to work
out this little mini-set

01:05.370 --> 01:07.308
I'm gonna do for a live
stream with Luke, so...

01:07.309 --> 01:08.378
sure.

01:08.379 --> 01:11.203
You know, we have our own
little tour to worry about here,

01:11.204 --> 01:13.590
so I'm taking off tomorrow morning.

01:13.591 --> 01:15.084
Which is why I thought
it'd be a really good idea

01:15.085 --> 01:16.899
for us to get together before you go.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.968
So, first of all, welcome, Scarlett!

01:19.969 --> 01:23.182
I'm so happy that you
agreed to open for Juliette.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.258
I think it's gonna be really great.

01:24.259 --> 01:25.461
Oh, thank you for having me.

01:25.462 --> 01:27.087
I'm a little bit worried about the schedule

01:27.088 --> 01:28.353
and just getting my album finished

01:28.354 --> 01:29.595
in the middle of it all, but...

01:29.596 --> 01:31.370
Well, that's why it's great
to have a producer who travels.

01:31.371 --> 01:32.636
I go where I'm needed.

01:32.637 --> 01:34.395
And wanted.

01:34.396 --> 01:37.472
So, what is your big plan for me?

01:37.473 --> 01:39.399
Well, the, uh, performance at the Opry

01:39.400 --> 01:42.884
didn't... Quite have the
impact that the "Wrong Song" did

01:42.885 --> 01:45.456
in terms of repairing reputations.

01:45.457 --> 01:46.963
I don't think you can really judge a song

01:46.964 --> 01:48.580
from one performance at the Opry.

01:48.581 --> 01:50.034
Oh, I don't think it was
about the performance.

01:50.035 --> 01:51.578
Okay. We get it.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.485
I ruined the launch of your single.

01:54.486 --> 01:57.575
But [Chuckles] sorry. You
can't blame this all on me.

01:57.576 --> 02:01.415
Well... We're not gonna
dwell on it, are we?

02:01.416 --> 02:02.784
You're going on tour,

02:02.785 --> 02:04.514
so I suggest you do what we talked about

02:04.910 --> 02:06.868
and go out there and make some noise.

02:06.869 --> 02:09.288
Win back those fans
and those radio stations

02:09.289 --> 02:10.735
one city at a time.

02:10.737 --> 02:13.801
I have spent $500,000 of my own money

02:13.802 --> 02:15.308
to promote these dates,

02:15.309 --> 02:19.081
so I'm just not quite sure
how much more noise I can make.

02:19.082 --> 02:21.472
So, guess we are done here?

02:21.473 --> 02:23.154
Yeah? Cool.

02:23.155 --> 02:25.997
Y... uh, sure. Well, have a great trip.

02:29.161 --> 02:30.885
Hey, Gunnar, where you at, man?

02:30.886 --> 02:32.263
Layla: What's all this new stuff?

02:32.264 --> 02:33.937
Get your butt out here.

02:33.938 --> 02:36.209
Hey. You guys already back from tour?

02:36.210 --> 02:38.214
[Groans] Travel day.

02:38.215 --> 02:40.259
Playing the Bridgestone
the night after next.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.444
Oh, nice. [Chuckles]

02:41.445 --> 02:42.656
Yeah. What's going on, man?

02:42.657 --> 02:44.463
You, uh, win the lottery or something?

02:44.464 --> 02:46.746
Well, first royalty check
came in for "Ball and Chain,"

02:46.747 --> 02:49.319
so figured I'd grow the place up a little.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.768
Yes. We've been doing
some growing up ourselves.

02:54.093 --> 02:55.342
[Laughs]

02:55.343 --> 02:56.759
I can't believe you
didn't see it on Twitter.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.820
Wow.
C-c-congratulations.

02:58.821 --> 02:59.859
Thanks, man.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.528
I'd be honored if you'd be my best man.

03:01.529 --> 03:02.870
Wait. When's all this happening?

03:02.871 --> 03:04.373
Soon. [Cellphone rings]

03:04.374 --> 03:05.512
Hang on.

03:05.513 --> 03:06.842
Oh, that's Jeff Fordham. One second.

03:06.843 --> 03:08.312
Hey, Jeff. What's up, man?

03:08.617 --> 03:10.732
That's right... to quote my pal here,

03:10.733 --> 03:12.909
went and got myself a ball and chain.

03:13.619 --> 03:14.982
[Laughs]

03:14.983 --> 03:16.452
Uh-huh.

03:16.453 --> 03:18.127
Oh, sure. We can do that.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.730
Welcome home, baby!

03:22.731 --> 03:24.254
Hey. Thought you'd be at work.

03:24.255 --> 03:26.758
Oh, I cleared my schedule. Tomorrow, too.

03:26.759 --> 03:28.411
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here.

03:28.412 --> 03:29.615
Workaholic in recovery, huh?

03:30.222 --> 03:32.474
Mmm. [Both moan]

03:32.475 --> 03:34.315
- Somebody miss me?
- Something awful.

03:34.316 --> 03:35.494
[Chuckles]

03:35.495 --> 03:37.979
But I did have these to keep me company.

03:38.416 --> 03:40.739
<i>Compared you to Steve Earle
and Kris Kristofferson?</i>

03:40.740 --> 03:42.525
They gave you five stars!

03:42.526 --> 03:43.849
So, what? You got five copies?

03:43.850 --> 03:45.691
What can I say? I'm proud of you.

03:45.692 --> 03:46.917
Thank you.

03:47.788 --> 03:48.857
[Sighs]

03:48.858 --> 03:51.020
And I'm so happy you're
home for a few days.

03:51.021 --> 03:52.189
Yeah, me too.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.149
Just tell me you don't have
a bunch of interviews to do.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.817
I got nothing till the big gig, you know?

03:56.125 --> 03:57.336
I mean, Maddie just texted,

03:57.337 --> 03:58.921
so I got a lesson with her tomorrow,

03:58.922 --> 04:01.041
but that's not till the afternoon.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.035
I can think of something to fill the time.

04:07.295 --> 04:08.752
Oh, yeah?

04:12.187 --> 04:13.865
Oh, yeah.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:22.980 --> 04:25.483
What did I just tell you about
using the computer at the table?

04:25.484 --> 04:27.020
I was looking up something for school.

04:27.021 --> 04:28.961
Put it away, please. [Doorbell rings]

04:28.962 --> 04:30.813
- I got it!
- Now.

04:30.814 --> 04:33.890
- Okay.
- Hey!

04:33.891 --> 04:35.710
Luke: How you doing? Oh,
my goodness! You're tall!

04:35.711 --> 04:36.933
- Rayna: Hey.
- Hey. [Chuckles]

04:36.934 --> 04:37.965
What are you doing here?

04:37.966 --> 04:40.033
Well, I came by to tell you
in person how much I can't wait

04:40.034 --> 04:42.020
to crank out "Ball and Chain"
with you tomorrow night.

04:42.021 --> 04:43.346
- Aww.
- Mmm.

04:43.347 --> 04:44.869
- Well, aren't you sweet?
- Hey, there, Maddie.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.264
<i>- Hi.
- I am excited.</i>

04:46.265 --> 04:47.773
I'm excited for our live
stream of "Ball and Chain."

04:47.774 --> 04:50.197
- Yeah. Me too.
- I thought you hated social media.

04:50.198 --> 04:51.758
I do... for my personal life.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.372
But, you know, now that I'm an independent,

04:53.373 --> 04:55.589
<i>it is a great way to
get the music out there.</i>

04:55.590 --> 04:57.017
Yep. It's the name of the game.

04:57.018 --> 04:57.873
All right, y'all, listen.

04:57.874 --> 04:59.548
Go upstairs, get yourselves
packed for daddy's

04:59.549 --> 05:01.026
before we leave for school, okay?

05:04.886 --> 05:07.824
Can't I just stay here, just this one week?

05:07.825 --> 05:09.784
Honey, we talked about it already.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.816
She's had a little case
of being a teenager.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.275
[Chuckling] Yeah. [Chuckles]

05:18.364 --> 05:19.789
I got to get their lunches ready.

05:21.132 --> 05:23.936
She must've picked up the
same strand my son Colt has.

05:23.937 --> 05:26.036
Maybe we could, you know,
quarantine them together.

05:26.037 --> 05:27.554
Oh, I would love that.

05:28.533 --> 05:32.668
He's, um, actually gonna
be in town tomorrow night

05:32.669 --> 05:34.020
for the show.

05:34.021 --> 05:35.344
- He is?
- Yeah. [Sighs]

05:35.802 --> 05:37.403
Are we gonna get to meet your kids?

05:37.404 --> 05:40.353
Uh, just the one. Sage
has a recital back home.

05:40.354 --> 05:42.494
Great. [Chuckles]

05:42.495 --> 05:45.133
Um, he's a great kid...

05:45.560 --> 05:47.279
Despite the outfit.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.581
[Gasps] [Laughs]

05:48.582 --> 05:50.613
- Is that his
profile? - Mm-hmm.

05:50.614 --> 05:53.941
How does a 16-year-old
have 20,000 followers?

05:53.942 --> 05:55.899
Oh, he's a ham. Takes after his daddy.

05:55.900 --> 05:56.852
[Laughs]

05:56.853 --> 05:58.988
Who's got 5 million, by the way.

05:58.989 --> 06:00.076
So, what do you say?

06:00.077 --> 06:01.997
You think you want to let
the kids mix it up tomorrow?

06:01.998 --> 06:04.775
Yeah, I do. I think that'd be great.

06:04.776 --> 06:05.919
All right.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.976
I do feel like, you know, I've...

06:07.977 --> 06:10.400
I've tried to keep my girls
sort of kind of low-profile

06:10.401 --> 06:13.932
in terms of all that media stuff, so...

06:13.933 --> 06:16.913
If we can just sort of avoid
the tweets and the selfies

06:16.914 --> 06:19.467
and all that... just
make it us, just family.

06:20.015 --> 06:21.272
Deal.

06:21.273 --> 06:23.107
Hardly said a word on the plane.

06:23.108 --> 06:24.743
Uh, not sure how I feel

06:24.744 --> 06:26.964
about private jets and these big arenas.

06:26.965 --> 06:28.790
You say it like it's a bad thing.

06:29.924 --> 06:32.739
Look, you're not a waitress
writing poems in her book anymore.

06:34.044 --> 06:35.256
I know.

06:35.747 --> 06:36.926
And when I'm out there,

06:36.927 --> 06:38.362
that 20 minutes singing to everybody,

06:38.363 --> 06:39.937
that's my favorite thing in the world.

06:39.938 --> 06:43.050
It's just the other 23 hours of traveling

06:43.051 --> 06:44.829
and sleeping in a different bed every night

06:44.830 --> 06:47.372
and then having to go to industry parties.

06:48.140 --> 06:50.307
I just wanted to make my album. That's all.

06:50.308 --> 06:51.776
And we're going to.

06:51.777 --> 06:54.627
I got the perfect piece of music
for us to start with right now.

06:54.628 --> 06:56.682
Doesn't Juliette need you
out on the stage with her?

06:56.683 --> 06:58.222
Can't be playing in her band

06:58.223 --> 07:00.756
when I got an album to produce, can I?

07:00.757 --> 07:02.403
[Laughs]

07:02.404 --> 07:03.988
[Indistinct conversation]

07:04.982 --> 07:05.997
Teddy: Hey, darlin'.

07:05.998 --> 07:08.511
Hey, daddy. Just finished my
English homework with Anne.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.783
Excellent.

07:10.743 --> 07:11.852
Where's Maddie?

07:11.853 --> 07:13.842
At Talia's, studying for her history test.

07:15.231 --> 07:17.209
I thought that was an approved activity.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.729
It is. But her history
test was last Friday.

07:22.753 --> 07:25.487
Where's your sister?
And do not cover for her.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.365
Juliette: They cut this down any further,

07:28.366 --> 07:30.281
I might as well be playing a nightclub.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.980
Glenn: Honey, you're
the biggest controversy

07:31.981 --> 07:33.859
in country since the Dixie Chicks.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.241
Gonna take some time to blow over. [Scoffs]

07:35.721 --> 07:38.164
Well, I'll take a death threat
over a dead room any day.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.998
How am I supposed to be
heard if there's nobody here?

07:41.999 --> 07:43.673
Your true fans will be.

07:43.674 --> 07:46.961
Well, honestly, I was hoping
for some Rayna Jaymes fans.

07:46.962 --> 07:49.650
All the money I'm out of
pocket to promote these dates?

07:49.651 --> 07:52.019
Please tell me that there's
at least some sort of mention

07:52.020 --> 07:54.186
about me signing with Highway
65 in the local papers.

07:54.187 --> 07:56.702
<i>Uh... There is a mention.</i>

07:58.970 --> 08:00.792
RAYNA JAYMES SOME DAS RÁDIOS.
CULPA DE JULIETTE BARNES?

08:01.408 --> 08:03.367
There's no such thing as bad publicity.

08:03.368 --> 08:05.374
Oh, yeah. Right.

08:05.375 --> 08:08.616
Well, whoever I'm playing to...

08:09.128 --> 08:11.280
I'm gonna rock their faces off.

08:12.224 --> 08:13.623
[Inhales deeply]

08:13.624 --> 08:15.687
You know, I can't wait
to see your show tomorrow.

08:15.688 --> 08:17.384
Your mom playing, too.

08:17.712 --> 08:19.191
Gonna be a regular family affair.

08:19.192 --> 08:22.023
[Laughs] Maybe someday
we can all play together.

08:22.024 --> 08:23.375
Tell you what... you
keep picking like that,

08:23.376 --> 08:24.615
it won't be long.

08:24.616 --> 08:27.031
You're getting seriously good, young lady.

08:27.032 --> 08:28.920
[Chuckles] Thank you, dad.

08:30.641 --> 08:33.408

28:29.419 --> 28:31.154
Uh, Deacon's going back out on stage.

28:31.155 --> 28:33.498
Look, that's not the agreement
I had with your mom. Let's go.

28:33.499 --> 28:34.930
<i>Dad, I'm not grounded.</i>

28:34.931 --> 28:36.723
- I don't want to go.
- That's too bad.

You've already gotten
enough of a pass tonight.

Teddy, it's just a couple songs, all right?

28:40.092 --> 28:41.926

everything... again.

had an agreement, remember?

28:58.082 --> 29:01.387
Teddy, I will bring the girls
home right after the show, okay?

I was telling you about.

29:19.387 --> 29:20.474
You all right?

29:20.475 --> 29:21.442
At least now I understand

29:21.443 --> 29:23.459
why Deacon always seems
to be in the middle of it.

What are you talking about?

29:26.500 --> 29:27.611

38:31.099 --> 38:34.110
I haven't talked about with
anybody in a very long time.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.954
It's always just been about
protecting my baby girl.

38:36.955 --> 38:39.207
She's not a baby anymore, Rayna.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.715
And neither's my boy.

38:40.716 --> 38:42.560
I mean, they... they want the world

38:42.561 --> 38:44.673
to know them on their own terms.

38:44.674 --> 38:46.118
They're kids, Luke.

38:46.119 --> 38:48.232
They don't even know
what their own terms are.

38:49.753 --> 38:52.128
When we were their age, we
didn't have all this social media

38:52.575 --> 38:55.453
defining our every move and mistake.

38:56.733 --> 38:58.757
Maddie has not sorted this out yet,

38:58.758 --> 38:59.872
and I will be damned

38:59.873 --> 39:02.118
if she's gonna be doing
that in the public eye.

39:02.993 --> 39:04.208
<i>What about you?</i>

39:04.950 --> 39:06.535
You sorted it out yet?

39:06.536 --> 39:07.722
In what way?

39:08.279 --> 39:09.869
With Deacon.

39:09.870 --> 39:10.969
Listen, those years with him

39:10.970 --> 39:12.560
were some of the most
painful and tumultuous

39:12.561 --> 39:14.196
of my entire life.

39:14.197 --> 39:17.630
And this past year, when
he... Found out about this,

39:17.631 --> 39:19.973
all those demons came
up to the surface again

39:19.974 --> 39:21.597
with a vengeance.

39:21.598 --> 39:22.860
[Sighs]

39:26.420 --> 39:28.979
It's hard to believe there's
nothing between y'all.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.478
<i>Well, there is.</i>

39:32.190 --> 39:34.066
We have a daughter together.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.567
And a history.

39:38.970 --> 39:40.743
But you're my present.

39:44.058 --> 39:46.185
And I hope my future.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.064
I think I can get past this.

39:53.432 --> 39:56.962
But the way I see it... You need a minute,

39:56.963 --> 40:00.192
and me... I need a few.

40:00.660 --> 40:04.255
But mostly, you need to go figure
this out with your family...

40:04.822 --> 40:06.569
whoever that is to you.

40:07.887 --> 40:11.029
Here's to making beautiful music together.

40:11.335 --> 40:12.714
Mm. [Clink]

40:12.715 --> 40:14.260
We're headed out early in the morning.

40:14.261 --> 40:15.795
Want to go back to the hotel with us?

40:16.193 --> 40:18.893
No. I think I'm gonna stay
here for a while. Thank you.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.403
Attagirl! That's the spirit.

40:21.404 --> 40:23.416
<i>Don't do anything I would do.</i>

40:29.713 --> 40:30.750
[Clears throat]

40:30.751 --> 40:34.534
I know she's drunk and
all, but is... is she high?

40:34.535 --> 40:36.338
No. She's never done drugs.

40:36.339 --> 40:37.617
Why do you ask?

40:38.099 --> 40:41.922
I don't know. Something about
her just reminds me of my mom.

40:42.495 --> 40:44.671
You know, she wanted me to fire her.

40:44.672 --> 40:46.647
She's vulnerable.

40:48.208 --> 40:50.255
She's not the only one.

40:50.256 --> 40:51.850
[Sighs]

40:51.851 --> 40:53.310
I wasn't being totally honest

40:53.311 --> 40:55.913
when I said the song wasn't
about you and Scarlett.

40:55.914 --> 40:57.796
<i>Tell me something I don't know.</i>

40:58.602 --> 41:00.305
Okay. I'm terrified.

41:01.761 --> 41:03.131
Of us.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.543
Of you.

41:05.544 --> 41:06.753
Hey.

41:06.754 --> 41:08.339
Baby, listen.

41:09.107 --> 41:10.794
In order for this to work,

41:11.752 --> 41:14.288
you got to let go of this
jealousy thing once and for all

41:14.289 --> 41:15.681
and trust me.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.328
I do.

41:17.329 --> 41:20.593
I do trust you, which scares me even more.

41:22.107 --> 41:23.828
You have my heart.

41:24.573 --> 41:26.918
You're capable of destroying me.

41:27.635 --> 41:29.313
I would never do that.

41:31.988 --> 41:33.635
[Crowd cheers]

41:33.636 --> 41:35.085
Man: Layla and will, look over here!

41:35.086 --> 41:37.029
Will: Here's one for you. Here we go.

41:37.030 --> 41:38.794
[Laughs] Whoo!

41:38.795 --> 41:40.598
[Crowd cheers] Put that in your paper!

41:40.599 --> 41:42.230
Hey! Hey!

41:42.231 --> 41:44.774
I think I'm a-keep this
one. What do you say? Huh?

41:45.156 --> 41:46.360
Layla: Aah!

41:46.684 --> 41:48.307
[Cheers and applause] All right!

41:49.472 --> 41:51.295
Deacon, where are you?

41:51.296 --> 41:53.204
I really need to talk to you about Maddie.

41:53.205 --> 41:55.759
Can you call me back, please, tonight?

41:57.020 --> 41:58.410
Bye.

42:03.553 --> 42:05.394
I don't expect you to forgive me.

42:05.395 --> 42:06.848
See, what I don't understand is this...

42:08.064 --> 42:10.028
why are you still here?

42:10.029 --> 42:10.901
- I'm...
- We're done.

42:10.902 --> 42:11.855
- Do you get that?
- Yes.

42:11.856 --> 42:12.842
- Do you get that?
- Yes.

42:12.843 --> 42:14.081
Then why are you here?!

42:14.082 --> 42:15.751
Because I'm worried about you.

42:15.752 --> 42:17.027
Oh, my God. [Laughs]

42:17.028 --> 42:18.758
What are you doing? Where are you going?

42:18.759 --> 42:20.616
You don't get to know that anymore, okay?!

42:20.617 --> 42:22.523
Okay, but before you go out there

42:22.524 --> 42:24.266
and ruin your life again,

42:24.267 --> 42:26.732
please... please think of your daughter.

42:26.733 --> 42:28.170
Think about your music.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.675
Please, don't... don't
throw everything away.

42:30.998 --> 42:32.195
[Sighs]

42:34.000 --> 42:37.401
This... this is who you are.

42:37.402 --> 42:39.936
That's a mighty fine
closing statement, counselor.

42:42.365 --> 42:43.856
[Magazine thuds]

42:44.331 --> 42:46.297
But I'm done being saved.
