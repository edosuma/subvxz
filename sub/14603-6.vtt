You're annoying <i>and</i> a loser.
Bye.

08:06.093 --> 08:08.627
At least clean up your room.
Not gonna happen.

08:08.629 --> 08:10.995
You're only spiting yourself.
Not really.

08:10.997 --> 08:12.264
Oh, my gosh.
I don't have time for this.

08:12.266 --> 08:13.682
I need to get the Turkey
in the oven.

08:13.684 --> 08:16.968
Just please don't act like
a freak in front of our guests.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.637
<i>There he was...</i>

08:18.639 --> 08:21.005
<i>Shaun Cassidy,
my teen dream.</i>

08:21.007 --> 08:22.607
<i>But there was no way</i>

08:22.609 --> 08:25.143
<i>I could let him
come face-to-face</i>

08:25.145 --> 08:26.844
<i>with my real boyfriend.</i>

08:30.015 --> 08:33.735
<i>While I worried about Dorrit
letting her true colors show,</i>

08:33.736 --> 08:35.537
<i>Maggie had hidden
her true colors</i>

08:35.539 --> 08:38.657
<i>for Walt's sake.</i>

08:39.825 --> 08:41.159
Are you going to church?

08:41.160 --> 08:42.193
What are you doing here?

08:42.195 --> 08:43.695
Your dad invited a bunch of us
to come over

08:43.697 --> 08:44.963
and eat and watch the game.

08:44.965 --> 08:46.864
Couldn't turn down an invitation
from the boss.

08:46.866 --> 08:48.717
Or a chance to see you.

08:48.719 --> 08:51.836
Even if you are dressed
like Nancy Reagan.

08:51.838 --> 08:53.638
Not that it's any
of your business,

08:53.640 --> 08:55.557
but I'm going
to my boyfriend's,

08:55.559 --> 08:57.459
where they dress up
for dinner.

08:57.461 --> 09:00.145
I... didn't know you guys
were back together.

09:00.147 --> 09:01.479
Now you do.

09:01.481 --> 09:02.714
And your mom's okay
with you missing Thanksgiving

09:02.716 --> 09:03.982
with your family?

09:03.984 --> 09:07.051
She thinks it's great.
It means we're serious.

09:07.053 --> 09:09.387
If you'll excuse me.

09:17.530 --> 09:19.197
Here we go. I can do this.

09:19.199 --> 09:20.415
You're already behind.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.899
You shouldn't have taken
an hour to clean up

09:21.901 --> 09:23.251
for your cool new boyfriend.

09:23.253 --> 09:26.237
Zip it, Dorrit. It's 10:58,

09:26.239 --> 09:27.622
which means
I'm two minutes ahead

09:27.624 --> 09:30.041
of my perfect
Thanksgiving schedule.

09:31.127 --> 09:33.295
Wait.

09:33.297 --> 09:35.513
I can't read the recipe.

09:35.515 --> 09:36.715
Probably a grease stain.

09:36.717 --> 09:38.266
Looks like
we can't eat Turkey.

09:38.268 --> 09:40.018
(Clatter)

09:42.254 --> 09:44.422
Let's see.
Christmas cookies.

09:44.424 --> 09:45.674
"Fun with fondue."

09:45.676 --> 09:47.275
Quick breads and cakes.

09:47.277 --> 09:49.294
Where are all
the normal cookbooks?

09:49.296 --> 09:50.729
How should I know?

09:50.731 --> 09:52.614
(Breathing heavily) Okay,
so I don't have any recipes.

09:52.616 --> 09:55.099
Uh... you always hung out
with mom in the kitchen

09:55.101 --> 09:56.434
while dad and I watched
football.

09:56.436 --> 09:59.204
Any chance she taught you how
to, you know, cook a Turkey?

09:59.206 --> 10:01.105
Nope. Sorry.

10:01.107 --> 10:02.874
What am I gonna do?

10:02.876 --> 10:05.736
Admit this whole idea's
a joke.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:14.950 --> 10:17.333
(Sighs) I am so happy
you're here.

10:17.335 --> 10:20.086
My perfect Thanksgiving is
turning into a total disaster.

10:20.088 --> 10:23.072
And forget about me keeping
an air of mystery for George.

10:23.074 --> 10:25.041
I was on the verge
of asking my dad

10:25.043 --> 10:27.093
to make his frito
and bean dip for dinner.

10:27.095 --> 10:29.379
Oh. Well, good thing
we did the early seating

10:29.381 --> 10:30.547
at the country club.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.682
(Singsongy) I'm yours
for the rest of the day.

10:32.684 --> 10:36.135
Donna was there.
If I had to hear her coo...

10:36.137 --> 10:37.971
(Imitates Donna)
"My boyfriend Sebastian"...

10:37.973 --> 10:39.022
(Normal voice)
One more time...

10:39.024 --> 10:40.690
Sebastian was
at the country club?

10:40.692 --> 10:43.476
No, but that didn't stop her
from going on and on about him.

10:43.478 --> 10:46.496
<i>So...</i> What have you
gotten done so far?

10:46.498 --> 10:48.932
Um, the Turkey's thawed.

10:48.934 --> 10:51.417
Okay. Good. What else?
I called you.

10:51.419 --> 10:53.236
Then let's get down
to business.

10:53.238 --> 10:55.121
(Doorbell rings)
Oh, no. He's here.

10:55.123 --> 10:57.123
(Tom) I'll get it!
Apron or not?

10:57.125 --> 10:58.875
Is it
too suburban hausfrau?

10:58.877 --> 11:00.710
George has only seen
Manhattan, Carrie,

11:00.712 --> 11:02.778
and I don't want
Connecticut Carrie to scare him.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.080
He knows
you're from the suburbs.

11:04.082 --> 11:05.331
What's the big deal?

11:05.333 --> 11:06.883
Mouse, we talked
about this.

11:06.885 --> 11:09.335
It's too early for him
to see so much of the real me.

11:09.337 --> 11:11.054
There are photo albums
in this house

11:11.056 --> 11:12.972
of me in headgear.
<i>Headgear.</i>

11:12.974 --> 11:14.290
Okay. Okay, I get it.

11:14.292 --> 11:17.143
You look like you, Carrie,

11:17.145 --> 11:18.761
non hausfrau variety.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.129
You have nothing
to worry about.

11:20.131 --> 11:22.899
Thanks.

11:22.901 --> 11:23.933
(Exhales deeply)

11:23.935 --> 11:25.735
<i>The food would have to wait.</i>

11:25.737 --> 11:28.137
<i>Phase two of "operation
perfect Thanksgiving"</i>

11:28.139 --> 11:30.990
<i>was in effect...
Impressing George.</i>

11:30.992 --> 11:32.809
(Tom) Good to see you again.
Come on in. Uh, can I tell her...

11:32.811 --> 11:33.993
Coats, guys?

11:33.995 --> 11:35.695
I know Carrie's expecting you.

11:35.697 --> 11:37.363
Welcome to our home,
Mr. silver.

11:37.365 --> 11:40.116
Oh, call me "Harlan."
George does.

11:40.118 --> 11:42.485
- Harlan.
- Call him "Mr. silver""

11:42.487 --> 11:47.123
right. (Chuckles)
Happy Thanksgiving, George.

11:49.043 --> 11:51.511
(Exhales)

11:54.965 --> 11:57.267
(Harlan) Wonderful bottle of
scotch for a wonderful day.

11:57.269 --> 11:59.001
I look forward
to partaking...

11:59.003 --> 12:02.188
<i>Just when it seemed like
everything was under control,</i>

12:02.190 --> 12:04.924
<i>there he was.</i>

12:09.813 --> 12:12.398
Dad, George, Harlan...
Uh, Mr. silver,

12:12.400 --> 12:13.650
why don't you head to the den?

12:13.652 --> 12:16.252
Uh, you'll find crudit...
Croo-dit... carrot sticks

12:16.254 --> 12:17.853
on the coffee table,
and I believe

12:17.855 --> 12:19.188
the cowboys/patriots game
is about to start.

12:19.190 --> 12:20.456
Sounds good to me.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.791
You don't need help
in the kitchen?

12:21.793 --> 12:25.194
No. No. Go ahead. You don't
wanna miss kickoff.

12:28.549 --> 12:29.865
I'd rather hang out
with you.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.384
Um...

12:31.386 --> 12:33.670
Well, in, hat case, how about
I take you on a tour

12:33.672 --> 12:34.921
of the upstairs?

12:34.923 --> 12:37.674
Hmm. I like that idea.
<i>(Man speaks indistinctly TV)</i>

12:37.676 --> 12:38.925
Go ahead.

12:38.927 --> 12:40.476
<i>(Man) Can Tony Dorsett
run the ball defensively?</i>

12:40.478 --> 12:42.729
And which quarterback shows up
<i>and has the better day?</i>

12:42.731 --> 12:43.980
Nice try.

12:43.982 --> 12:46.149
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.267
(Closes drawer)

12:48.269 --> 12:51.070
<i>Come back for the kickoff.
So sit back for a...</i>

12:51.072 --> 12:53.656
I'm sorry. If someone
who looks like

12:53.658 --> 12:55.241
Arnold Schwarzen-
whatever-his-name is

12:55.243 --> 12:57.043
comes to your door and asks
if you're Sarah Connor,

12:57.045 --> 12:58.361
you say "no."

12:58.363 --> 13:00.413
You say you're Jane Smith
and you get the hell... eck

13:00.415 --> 13:02.582
out of there.

13:02.584 --> 13:06.369
Other than that,
the movie was pretty good.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.621
(Laughs) You do have
a way with words, Maggie.

13:08.623 --> 13:10.206
I never go to the cinema
anymore.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.375
Every film they release looks
more dreadful than the last.

13:12.377 --> 13:14.410
(Lowered voice) Thank you for
saving me from extreme boredom.

13:14.412 --> 13:16.078
I owe you.
Yeah, you do.

13:16.080 --> 13:20.049
Walter, did you catch
the dartmouth-Princeton game

13:20.051 --> 13:23.102
last weekend?
No, sir, I missed it. Darn!

13:23.104 --> 13:24.387
Well, don't you worry.
You'll have plenty of time

13:24.389 --> 13:25.855
to go to the games
when you're at dartmouth.

13:25.857 --> 13:28.775
I made most of my closest
friends when I was there.

13:28.777 --> 13:31.611
Did I ever tell you how
my D.K.E. Brothers and I...

13:31.613 --> 13:34.147
spent an entire night
in a wine cellar tied up naked.

13:34.149 --> 13:36.315
Yes, many, many times.
(Mrs. Reynolds clears throat)

13:36.317 --> 13:37.950
It's always funny
to hear, though.

13:37.952 --> 13:40.987
Well, I can't wait for <i>you</i>
to have that experience,

13:40.989 --> 13:42.772
too, Walter.
(Coughs)

13:42.774 --> 13:45.291
Me either, dad.

13:45.293 --> 13:47.577
And what about you, Maggie?

13:47.579 --> 13:49.962
Any idea where you'd like
to go to college?

13:49.964 --> 13:51.497
College?
Oh, no, I'm a junior.

13:51.499 --> 13:53.800
I don't have to worry
about that till next year.

13:53.802 --> 13:54.967
<i>(Jazz playing)</i>

13:54.969 --> 13:57.170
Oh. Um...

13:57.172 --> 13:59.255
I'll probably just
look for a school

13:59.257 --> 14:01.974
not too far away from Walt.

14:01.976 --> 14:04.761
We haven't really
talked about it.

14:04.763 --> 14:06.128
Yeah. I mean, who knows
what'll happen?

14:06.130 --> 14:07.463
The future's
a long way away.

14:07.465 --> 14:10.400
Indeed,
and you're much too young

14:10.402 --> 14:13.603
to make those kind of plans.

14:13.605 --> 14:15.488
Follow him to college?

14:15.490 --> 14:18.908
That was a joke.
What is this, the 1950s?

14:18.910 --> 14:23.029
(Laughs)
(Both laughing)

14:23.031 --> 14:24.997
I don't get it.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.754
<i>(Carrie) Maggie couldn't have
felt less at home.</i>

14:33.707 --> 14:34.990
(Sighs)

14:34.992 --> 14:37.660
So here we are...
My bedroom.

14:37.662 --> 14:40.880
<i>But George seemed
pretty comfortable in mine.</i>

14:47.771 --> 14:50.973
I've been waiting to do that
since I saw you in this apron.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.195
(Banging on door)

14:56.197 --> 14:59.315
(Dorrit) Carrie?
I'm busy.

14:59.317 --> 15:01.183
(Banging resumes)

15:01.185 --> 15:03.786
Mouse needs you in the kitchen.
She says it's urgent.

15:03.788 --> 15:06.372
Poor mouse.
She tends to get flustered.

15:06.374 --> 15:08.190
I should probably go see
what's going on.

15:08.192 --> 15:09.859
No problem. Maybe later
you can give me a tour

15:09.861 --> 15:10.993
of the basement.

15:10.995 --> 15:14.029
It's kind of dark and yucky
down there.

15:17.134 --> 15:18.417
Mouse was having
a total cow.

15:18.419 --> 15:20.002
But don't worry.
I'll keep George company.

15:20.004 --> 15:23.322
Come on. I'll take you
to the den.

15:23.324 --> 15:25.308
<i>I didn't think
anything could be worse</i>

15:25.310 --> 15:28.344
<i>than leaving Dorrit alone
with George,</i>

15:28.346 --> 15:29.979
<i>but I was wrong.</i>

15:29.981 --> 15:31.848
Just close your eyes
and do it.

15:31.850 --> 15:34.016
You do it. You're the one
who wants to be the surgeon.

15:34.018 --> 15:36.486
A people surgeon,
not a Turkey surgeon!

15:36.488 --> 15:38.988
Now hurry up, or this Turkey
won't be done until midnight,

15:38.990 --> 15:40.690
which I highly doubt is what
you had in mind

15:40.692 --> 15:42.275
for your
"perfect Thanksgiving""

15:42.277 --> 15:44.327
I was thinking
more like 5:30.

15:44.329 --> 15:47.246
Well, then you know
what to do.

15:47.248 --> 15:48.731
(Groans)

15:56.590 --> 15:59.008
(Gasps) So we eat
at midnight.

15:59.010 --> 16:00.075
And George is from Manhattan.

16:00.077 --> 16:01.260
He probably does that
all the time.

16:01.262 --> 16:03.296
Carrie, do it. Go.

16:03.298 --> 16:06.767
- (Strained voice) Go, go! Go.
- Ew.

16:06.768 --> 16:07.933
(Squishing sound)

16:07.934 --> 16:09.018
(Gags) Aah!
(Gasps)

16:09.020 --> 16:10.353
What is that?
(Thud)

16:10.355 --> 16:11.604
(Gags)

16:11.606 --> 16:13.389
(Squishing sound)

16:14.391 --> 16:16.893
(Gasps)
(Gasps) Ew, oh, oh!

16:16.895 --> 16:18.227
Oh. Uhh!

16:18.229 --> 16:21.314
Okay. Great. Ugh.
So that's done.

16:21.316 --> 16:23.032
(Sighs) Now we I need to
go check on George and Dorrit.

16:23.034 --> 16:24.901
<i>(Game playing on TV)</i>

16:24.903 --> 16:26.485
Um, Carrie?
Yeah.

16:26.487 --> 16:29.038
We need those giblets
for the gravy.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.657
<i>(Man) He has a man free
in the middle. And... oh!</i>

16:31.659 --> 16:32.742
(Groans)

16:32.744 --> 16:34.777
Oh, come on!
You gotta catch the ball!

16:34.779 --> 16:36.946
You are pathetic!

16:36.948 --> 16:38.798
Ugh!
Landry, take your hat off.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.834
You looking forward to that
Turkey your sister's cooking?

16:41.836 --> 16:44.887
Oh, yeah, but then again,
I have a strong stomach.

16:44.889 --> 16:47.139
Do <i>you</i> have
a strong stomach?

16:47.141 --> 16:49.292
Oh, I get your shtick.

16:49.294 --> 16:51.126
I don't have a shtick.

16:51.128 --> 16:52.511
What's a shtick?

16:52.513 --> 16:54.430
Let me guess.

16:54.432 --> 16:56.131
You have a pet fish
named Morrissey.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.350
You wear all black

16:57.352 --> 16:58.568
because you think
it makes you look different,

16:58.570 --> 17:00.903
even though all your friends
dress that way, too.

17:00.905 --> 17:03.522
Morrissey is a hamster.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.825
So you're saying
I'm some kind of cliche?

17:05.827 --> 17:07.742
No, just going
through a phase.

17:07.744 --> 17:09.612
I'm sure my shrink
would have a name for it.

17:09.614 --> 17:12.949
You have a shrink?
That's so cool. I want one.

17:12.951 --> 17:15.201
He was a birthday present
when I turned 7.

17:15.203 --> 17:16.535
I was a biter.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.488
I bit people until I was 8.
Cool.

17:19.490 --> 17:20.756
(Tom) Go, go, go!
Go! Go, go, go, go!

17:20.758 --> 17:22.992
(Harlan) Come on! Ohh!
Come on! Ah!

17:22.993 --> 17:25.344
Brie?
Oh, sure.

17:25.346 --> 17:27.380
Hey, Dorrit, you wanna come hang
out with us in the kitchen?

17:27.382 --> 17:29.966
I know you used to love
to do that when mom was cooking.

17:29.968 --> 17:31.333
Come on. It'll be fun.

17:31.335 --> 17:33.452
Doesn't sound fun.
Dorrit.

17:33.454 --> 17:36.322
Besides, George and I
are talking.

17:36.324 --> 17:38.007
<i>(Cheering)</i>

17:38.009 --> 17:39.308
<i>Now he has
that breakaway speed.</i>

17:39.310 --> 17:41.310
Hey, George, can I borrow you
for a second?

17:41.312 --> 17:43.696
Uh... sure.

17:43.698 --> 17:45.314
(Tom) Oh, my...
(Harlan) He's... he's blind!

17:45.316 --> 17:46.983
Absolutely. Absolutely.

17:46.985 --> 17:48.317
Sorry you're stuck
with my sister.

17:48.319 --> 17:49.785
Is she being
a total bitch?

17:49.787 --> 17:52.154
No, not at all.
She's actually really cool.

17:52.156 --> 17:53.289
You don't have to be
polite.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.007
No, really.
We're actually having fun.

17:55.009 --> 17:58.044
Oh, God.
I mean, oh, good. (Chuckles)

17:58.046 --> 17:59.695
(Clatter)

17:59.697 --> 18:03.165
Carrie, I need you
in the kitchen. Now!

18:04.367 --> 18:07.202
I really, really need you.

18:07.204 --> 18:08.587
I think you should go
with your friend.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.222
She seems really frazzled.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.758
I guess I should.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.043
<i>(Carrie) I couldn't let
my boyfriend distract me</i>

18:14.045 --> 18:16.228
<i>from making
my perfect Thanksgiving meal.</i>

18:16.230 --> 18:18.230
Go on. I'll be fine.

18:18.232 --> 18:19.565
Okay.

18:19.567 --> 18:21.684
<i>(Crowd cheering)
(Man) Touchdown!</i>

18:21.686 --> 18:23.152
Yeah! (Laughs)

18:23.154 --> 18:24.887
Yeah! (Laughs)

18:24.889 --> 18:27.106
This better be serious.

18:27.108 --> 18:28.891
We have a dire situation
in there.

18:28.893 --> 18:31.243
Dorrit's torturing him?
No, it's much worse.

18:31.245 --> 18:33.062
(Laughs)

18:33.064 --> 18:34.580
She's bonding with him.

18:34.582 --> 18:35.865
And that's bad? Why?

18:35.867 --> 18:37.833
This is Dorrit.
She'll play nice to suck him in,

18:37.835 --> 18:39.452
then tell him
something hideous about me

18:39.454 --> 18:40.703
like the Disney world story.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.004
(Whispers)
The pants-peeing story?

18:42.006 --> 18:44.073
Not what I prefer
to call it, but yes.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.541
Well, we have
bigger problems.

18:45.543 --> 18:46.909
Bigger than George
finding out

18:46.911 --> 18:48.377
I peed on both
chip and Dale's laps?

18:48.379 --> 18:50.046
Yes, much bigger!

18:50.048 --> 18:53.516
Look at the Turkey!
It's enormous!

18:53.518 --> 18:55.267
The oven door
can't even close.

18:55.269 --> 18:56.919
Why on earth would you buy
such a big one?

18:56.921 --> 18:58.420
I didn't know they came
in different sizes.

18:58.422 --> 19:00.639
I thought they were
all just... Turkey-sized.

19:00.641 --> 19:02.475
Well, the heat's not staying in
because the door's ajar.

19:02.477 --> 19:04.977
At this rate, the Turkey won't
be done until Christmas.

19:04.979 --> 19:06.979
(Tom and Harlan) Whoo! Yeah!
(Clapping)

19:06.981 --> 19:09.826
What are we gonna do?

19:15.885 --> 19:18.637
(Creaking)

19:20.056 --> 19:21.189
(Closes door)
Uhh!

19:21.191 --> 19:22.524
(Beeps)

19:22.526 --> 19:25.477
There. Broil.
Now the Turkey will cook

19:25.479 --> 19:27.029
twice as fast,
and we'll still be on track

19:27.031 --> 19:28.697
to eat at 5:30,
6:00 at the latest.

19:28.699 --> 19:31.033
That actually seems
like it could work.

19:31.035 --> 19:32.651
Great. Problem solved.

19:32.653 --> 19:33.685
Not so fast!

19:33.687 --> 19:35.570
What about the gravy,
the sweet potatoes,

19:35.572 --> 19:37.155
and the 12 other things we have left
to do?! (Tom and Harlan cheering)

19:37.157 --> 19:38.290
(Harlan) Yeah!

19:38.292 --> 19:41.126
Ugh. You're right.
Just give me a minute.

19:41.128 --> 19:43.378
<i>(Cheering)
Now it's third down.</i>

19:43.380 --> 19:44.713
Where'd Dorrit go?

19:44.715 --> 19:45.998
Uh, upstairs. Knowing her,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.884
that means we won't see her
for the rest of the night.

19:48.886 --> 19:50.085
Are you kidding me?!

19:50.087 --> 19:51.536
That was...
That was out of bounds.

19:51.538 --> 19:52.888
(Tom) You're kidding me!

19:52.890 --> 19:56.808
Absolutely... or he's bought off
by the... the cow... ugh.

19:56.810 --> 19:59.678
Oh, uh, Carrie, any idea when
the Turkey will be done?

20:01.030 --> 20:02.314
Your mother called me
in for dinner

20:02.316 --> 20:04.266
right in the middle of
the fourth quarter every year.

20:04.268 --> 20:06.234
So please don't rush
on my account.

20:06.236 --> 20:09.404
Yeah. I don't think
that'll be a problem.

20:12.075 --> 20:14.559
All right. Now that Dorrit
is taken care of,

20:14.561 --> 20:19.781
I'm ready to do...
Whatever this thing does.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.951
Okay. Here's to
a better second quarter

20:22.953 --> 20:25.620
that leaves the cowboys
and that smug tom Landry bastard

20:25.622 --> 20:27.923
on their asses, huh?
(Clink)

20:27.925 --> 20:28.957
Who's your team, George?

20:28.959 --> 20:30.475
And please don't say
the cowboys.

20:30.477 --> 20:31.960
Worse.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.095
I'm a jets man.
(Tom sighs)

20:33.097 --> 20:34.713
I'll be back.
Gotta use the bathroom.

20:34.715 --> 20:37.099
How can he not like
the giants?

20:37.101 --> 20:38.583
I'm half-convinced
he does it just to bug me.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.385
That could be.
That could be.

20:40.387 --> 20:43.021
When Carrie was 10 years old,
she got so pissed off

20:43.023 --> 20:44.389
that I wouldn't let her
Pierce her ears,

20:44.391 --> 20:45.924
she declared herself
a cowboys fan.

20:45.926 --> 20:47.893
Well,
that Turkey smells good.

20:47.895 --> 20:49.061
I don't think I've had
a home-cooked meal

20:49.063 --> 20:50.479
since
the Ford administration.

20:50.481 --> 20:53.448
(Laughs) So I could get
used to not having a wife.

20:54.684 --> 20:57.986
Sorry. That came out wrong.

20:57.988 --> 21:00.739
It's okay. It's okay.

21:00.741 --> 21:02.607
I have some things
to be thankful for, too.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.043
Yeah? Carrie is in
the kitchen cooking dinner.

21:05.045 --> 21:08.780
Dorrit... has not blown
anything up yet.

21:08.782 --> 21:10.749
This is...
These are good signs.

21:10.751 --> 21:11.967
Right?
Yes.

21:11.969 --> 21:13.451
So I'm just gonna look
on the bright side.

21:13.453 --> 21:16.088
I get to Park myself here
and watch some football.

21:16.090 --> 21:18.090
Lucky me.
(Clink)

21:18.092 --> 21:20.175
<i>(Carrie) While my dad
was feeling grateful...</i>

21:20.177 --> 21:22.460
<i>(Man) The line of scrimmage
is pushed back.</i>

21:22.462 --> 21:24.312
(Carrie) Someone else found out
<i>he didn't have much</i>

21:24.314 --> 21:25.680
<i>to be grateful for.</i>

21:25.682 --> 21:27.599
<i>(Man) ...Going over.
This new England...</i>

21:27.601 --> 21:30.635
Your mother called.
She's very sorry,

21:30.637 --> 21:33.655
but she had to change
her plans.

21:33.657 --> 21:35.740
So she's bailing on me.

21:35.742 --> 21:38.643
Let me guess. She went off
with the tennis instructor?

21:38.645 --> 21:40.195
Where are they?

21:40.197 --> 21:41.696
Aspen?

21:41.698 --> 21:42.864
Palm beach?

21:42.866 --> 21:44.249
Saint barts.

21:44.251 --> 21:45.984
I'm sorry, Mr. Sebastian.

21:45.986 --> 21:48.837
Would you like to come
eat at my house?

21:48.839 --> 21:51.223
No. Thank you.

21:51.225 --> 21:53.041
No, you go be
with your family.

21:53.043 --> 21:57.596
I'm just gonna watch the game,
maybe order a pizza.

21:57.598 --> 22:00.182
<i>(Man speaks indistinctly)</i>

22:00.184 --> 22:01.666
<i>He breaks the tackle
inside the fourth,</i>

22:01.668 --> 22:03.685
<i>grabbed from behind
by clayborn...</i>

22:03.687 --> 22:05.353
<i>(Volume increases)
And brought down all...</i>

22:05.355 --> 22:09.007
(Clattering)

22:09.009 --> 22:11.143
Clearing the table?

22:11.145 --> 22:13.445
My family must be worse
than I thought.

22:13.447 --> 22:16.114
Mm-hmm.

22:16.116 --> 22:19.384
(Loud clatter)
Be careful with those.

22:19.386 --> 22:23.321
Whoa. What's wrong?

22:23.323 --> 22:24.689
I think I'm just sick of you

22:24.691 --> 22:26.741
not being able
to stand up to your parents.

22:26.743 --> 22:28.443
Where did that come from?

22:28.445 --> 22:31.046
It was so pathetic,
the way you just nodded

22:31.048 --> 22:32.581
and smiled about dartmouth.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.799
Why can't you just say it?

22:34.801 --> 22:38.420
"No, dad. I wanna go to N.Y.U.
And work in advertising."

22:38.422 --> 22:40.305
You're not saying
you wanna be a serial killer.

22:40.307 --> 22:41.590
What's the big deal?

22:41.592 --> 22:43.808
It <i>is</i> a big deal to my dad.
He has his own goals for me,

22:43.810 --> 22:45.894
and he doesn't care
what I really want.

22:45.896 --> 22:48.346
Why are you trying to pick
a fight with me about this?

22:48.348 --> 22:53.268
I don't know. At least
they have goals for you.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.353
No one in my life seems to be
thinking about my future,

22:55.355 --> 22:57.055
including me.

22:57.057 --> 22:59.390
That joke about
following you to college.

22:59.392 --> 23:01.493
Not a joke.

23:01.495 --> 23:03.495
Oh. Really?

23:03.497 --> 23:05.614
Yes, really.

23:05.616 --> 23:07.532
How's that supposed to make me
feel that you laughed at me?

23:07.534 --> 23:11.169
(Sighs) Mags, I laughed
because it seems crazy

23:11.171 --> 23:13.738
that someone like you
would ever do something

23:13.740 --> 23:16.374
like follow me.

23:16.376 --> 23:17.876
Someone like me?

23:17.878 --> 23:20.078
Yeah.
You're so sure of yourself,

23:20.080 --> 23:22.681
and you're not afraid
to be exactly who you are,

23:22.683 --> 23:26.067
unlike me, who just nods
and says "yes" to his dad.

23:27.888 --> 23:29.188
You really mean it?

23:29.189 --> 23:34.342
I want you to follow
your own dream.

23:35.478 --> 23:36.895
Yeah.

23:36.897 --> 23:39.781
<i>(Carrie) Maggie had never
thought much about the future,</i>

23:39.783 --> 23:41.399
<i>but maybe she needed to.</i>

23:41.401 --> 23:43.451
<i>It was
an uncomfortable realization</i>

23:43.453 --> 23:47.372
<i>that being with Walt
couldn't be her only goal.</i>

23:48.491 --> 23:52.777
Oh, wait. We need to add
a few more mini marshmallows.

23:54.780 --> 23:58.216
There.
Looks just like my mom's.

23:59.252 --> 24:01.803
Mission accomplished.
Sweet potatoes in the oven.

24:01.805 --> 24:03.388
Check.

24:03.390 --> 24:04.806
Right on schedule.
(Packaging rustles)

24:04.808 --> 24:06.925
My perfect Thanksgiving
is really gonna happen.

24:06.927 --> 24:09.728
Still trying
to pull off dinner?

24:09.730 --> 24:10.895
Must be some kind
of masochist.

24:10.897 --> 24:12.430
I did pull it off.

24:12.432 --> 24:13.631
We're actually gonna have
a Thanksgiving

24:13.633 --> 24:15.233
just like we had
with mom.

24:17.403 --> 24:18.486
What's her problem?

24:18.488 --> 24:19.688
I have no idea,

24:19.690 --> 24:22.140
but she's acting worse
than usual today.

24:22.142 --> 24:24.109
(Door closes)
Did she just leave?

24:24.111 --> 24:27.312
Uh-oh. Missing sister...
Not a perfect Thanksgiving.

24:27.314 --> 24:28.813
She is <i>not</i> going
to do this,

24:28.815 --> 24:32.984
not now, when everything's
finally coming together.

24:34.036 --> 24:36.037
<i>I could imagine all kinds
of scenarios</i>

24:36.039 --> 24:39.174
<i>for how Dorrit
could ruin Thanksgiving.</i>

24:39.176 --> 24:43.828
<i>But what I found
was completely unexpected.</i>

24:43.830 --> 24:45.513
What the hell
is wrong with you?

24:45.515 --> 24:47.569
You're smoking pot
with dad right inside?

24:47.570 --> 24:48.634
So?

24:48.635 --> 24:50.385
So this is
our family Thanksgiving,

24:50.387 --> 24:52.937
and all you're doing
is trying to ruin everything.

24:52.939 --> 24:54.339
You tried to embarrass me
in front of George.

24:54.341 --> 24:55.974
You won't help me
in the kitchen.

24:55.976 --> 24:59.527
It's like you
wanna sabotage tonight.

24:59.529 --> 25:02.864
You ruined those recipes and hid
the cookbooks, didn't you?

25:02.866 --> 25:04.949
So what if I did?

25:04.951 --> 25:06.517
(Sighs) What is it this time,
Dorrit?

25:06.519 --> 25:09.070
Don't feel like you're
getting enough attention?

25:09.072 --> 25:11.289
Well, you're about to get more
than you bargained for.

25:11.291 --> 25:13.041
I'm telling dad.

25:13.043 --> 25:15.026
Go ahead. I don't care.
I'm not the one

25:15.028 --> 25:17.362
desperate for attention,
wearing mom's apron

25:17.364 --> 25:18.663
and trying to pretend
to be her,

25:18.665 --> 25:20.531
like you can just
take her place.

25:20.533 --> 25:22.884
I'm not trying to pretend
anything, Dorrit.

25:22.886 --> 25:24.552
I'm trying to honor
mom's memory

25:24.554 --> 25:26.254
by making things
feel the same.

25:26.256 --> 25:28.873
But they're not, and you
can't make them that way.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.844
So why even try?

25:32.846 --> 25:36.665
<i>I finally realized why Dorrit

26:28.216 --> 26:30.783
Did you always know
you wanted to be a cop?

26:30.785 --> 26:33.937
(Chuckles) No. I wanted
to be the lead singer

26:33.939 --> 26:35.688

26:35.690 --> 26:37.774

It's stable. Why?

26:41.429 --> 26:43.696

26:45.266 --> 26:47.283
Joey got to go to college.
Joey's the smart one.

26:47.285 --> 26:50.487
Yeah, golden boy. Its' so gross,
how dad's proud of him

26:50.489 --> 26:52.789
for being a yuppie.

26:52.791 --> 26:54.440
So is there any money
for me to go to college?

26:54.442 --> 26:56.042
No.
Oh.

26:56.044 --> 26:58.144
But maybe you could get
a scholarship. (Chuckles)

26:58.146 --> 26:59.746

26:59.748 --> 27:02.165
You're a girl.
You can just marry Walt.

Now smoke is pouring out,

everyone to have

29:53.955 --> 29:55.221

30:31.608 --> 30:33.049
And what would that be,

30:33.051 --> 30:35.384
Humiliating myself
in front of my boyfriend,

30:35.386 --> 30:36.887
not having any food
to eat,

30:36.888 --> 30:38.771
or not having any power
until tomorrow

30:38.773 --> 30:40.523

are blown?

30:40.525 --> 30:41.641

30:41.643 --> 30:45.244
Well... we still
have ambrosia salad,

30:45.246 --> 30:47.196
and the firemen said
there's no major damage,

30:47.198 --> 30:50.983
and George... has been "looking
for candle"" for 20 minutes.

30:50.985 --> 30:53.069
He's probably avoiding me
until he can run

30:53.071 --> 30:55.688
screaming back to the city
and never see me again.

30:55.690 --> 30:57.390
I can think of a bright side.

30:57.392 --> 30:58.891
Since the Turkey exploded,

30:58.893 --> 31:02.194
no one had to taste
how bad it would have been.

31:02.196 --> 31:04.063
Just a joke.

31:04.065 --> 31:05.264
And thanks.

31:05.266 --> 31:11.153
For not telling dad...
About the pot.

31:11.155 --> 31:14.890
I'm gonna go help George
find those candles.

31:15.892 --> 31:19.528
Sweetie, I wasn't trying
to replace mom.

31:19.530 --> 31:21.230
I wanted us to have
a great day

31:21.232 --> 31:22.782
because that's what
she would have wanted.

31:22.784 --> 31:24.717
She loved Thanksgiving
so much.

31:24.719 --> 31:27.320
You don't even know how much
Thanksgiving stressed her out,

31:27.322 --> 31:29.488
do you? What are you talking about?
It was her favorite holiday.

31:29.490 --> 31:31.724
Please. She hated doing
all that work

31:31.726 --> 31:33.576
while dad sat around
watching football.

31:33.578 --> 31:35.745
She played her music loud
so she could scream at him

31:35.747 --> 31:37.413
without the entire family
hearing her.

31:37.415 --> 31:39.281
When I heard you
from upstairs,

31:39.283 --> 31:40.833
wigging out at the oven,

31:40.835 --> 31:43.252
for a second,
I swore it was her.

31:43.254 --> 31:45.287
Freaked me out.

31:45.289 --> 31:47.873
Wow, Dorrit.

31:47.875 --> 31:52.845
But then... it was kinda nice
to remember her.

31:54.348 --> 31:56.098
I wanted to forget
the whole day.

31:56.100 --> 32:00.186
That's why I hid the recipes
and got stoned.

32:00.188 --> 32:01.920
It felt wrong to even try
if she can't be here.

32:01.922 --> 32:05.558
To me it felt wrong
<i>not</i> to try.

32:09.446 --> 32:12.114
Next year, I'll pull out
the giblets.

32:12.116 --> 32:14.817
I always did that for mom.
I liked it.

32:14.819 --> 32:18.120
You're sick, and next year?
Are you kidding me?

32:18.122 --> 32:19.622
I'm never cooking again.

32:19.624 --> 32:20.990
When I'm an adult,

32:20.992 --> 32:23.209
I'm gonna use my oven
for storage or something.

32:23.211 --> 32:24.994
Probably a good idea.

32:24.996 --> 32:27.246
(Both laugh)

32:29.383 --> 32:31.317

is comforting.</i>

32:31.319 --> 32:32.635

32:32.637 --> 32:35.954

what we don't want to accept.</i>

32:35.956 --> 32:38.474
<i>But sooner or later,
we have to face the light.</i>

32:38.476 --> 32:40.959
Jeez, what the hell are you
doing sitting here in the dark?

32:40.961 --> 32:45.264
Look out. Drunk man,
open flame.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.650
(Sighs)

32:47.652 --> 32:49.985
What was I thinking?

32:49.987 --> 32:51.804
That... that I could just
watch the game

32:51.806 --> 32:54.139
and let my teenage daughter
do all the work?

32:54.141 --> 32:55.474
I'm the one that
should have been worrying

32:55.476 --> 32:57.777
about how to make Thanksgiving
perfect, not Carrie.

32:57.779 --> 33:01.313
I'm the one that's responsible
for keeping this family going.

33:01.315 --> 33:03.115
Only me.

33:06.336 --> 33:09.789
Only me. But what if
I can't do it?

33:09.791 --> 33:11.674
And what if I can't
keep us together?

33:11.676 --> 33:15.878
(Snoring)

33:15.880 --> 33:17.463
(Pats leg)
Patriots.

33:17.465 --> 33:19.632
Maybe you should head back
into the city.

33:19.634 --> 33:22.768
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

33:22.770 --> 33:24.804
I'll let my driver know.

33:32.062 --> 33:33.779
You're home early.

33:33.781 --> 33:35.080
What happened?

33:35.082 --> 33:36.649
Did the W.A.S.P.S find out
that you're catholic?

33:36.651 --> 33:38.234
I'm really not in the mood.

33:38.236 --> 33:41.454
Relax. It was a joke.

33:43.039 --> 33:45.691
(Sighs)

33:45.693 --> 33:47.576
So what happened?

33:47.578 --> 33:51.797
You are the last person
I wanna talk to about it.

33:51.799 --> 33:54.283
Well... I do care
about you, Maggie.

33:54.285 --> 33:57.703
Thanks.
If you mean it.

33:57.705 --> 34:03.175
Oh. (Exhales)
Of course I do.

34:05.712 --> 34:08.347
You know what? There is
one thing I wanna know, though.

34:09.766 --> 34:11.100
Did any of
the stuffed shirts notice

34:11.101 --> 34:12.400
that you're not wearing
any underwear

34:12.402 --> 34:14.520
under that
prim little dress?

34:15.405 --> 34:19.558
Who says I'm not wearing
any underwear?

34:19.560 --> 34:23.018
There is only one way
to find out.

34:26.399 --> 34:28.000
Wait.

34:28.002 --> 34:31.402
What's the problem?

34:31.405 --> 34:34.123
This is my problem.

34:34.125 --> 34:35.623
I keep doing things
without thinking

34:35.626 --> 34:39.678
how they're gonna affect
my future or my... boyfriend.

34:39.679 --> 34:42.748
Maybe it's better
if you stop thinking.

34:42.750 --> 34:48.587
I... I think
you should get out.

34:53.226 --> 34:58.263
<i>Maybe Maggie didn't have
any long-term goals.</i>

34:58.265 --> 35:03.569
<i>But her immediate goal
was to respect herself.</i>

35:05.705 --> 35:08.407
Well, everything is
as it should be.

35:08.409 --> 35:10.960
My dad's passed out
in the back of the town car.

35:10.962 --> 35:12.711
Happy Thanksgiving.

35:12.713 --> 35:14.213
Sorry I freaked out
and added to your list

35:14.215 --> 35:15.497
of terrible thanksgivings.

35:15.499 --> 35:16.665
Oh, Carrie, it's fine.

35:16.667 --> 35:18.384
You weren't avoiding me?

35:18.386 --> 35:20.118
You seem weirdly eager
to run off

35:20.120 --> 35:21.720
and look for candles
in a house you barely know.

35:21.722 --> 35:23.422
I was just trying
to give you space.

35:23.424 --> 35:26.308
That's what my shrink says to do
when people get upset.

35:26.310 --> 35:27.593
I was not avoiding you.

35:27.595 --> 35:28.761
Even though I yelled
and broke the oven

35:28.763 --> 35:30.128
and almost burned
the house down?

35:30.130 --> 35:31.680
Carrie, on the silver scale
of insane holidays,

35:31.682 --> 35:33.566
this is nothing.

35:33.568 --> 35:35.267
Last year my family
got banned from le cirque

35:35.269 --> 35:37.736
after kick threw
a Turkey leg at my dad.

35:37.738 --> 35:39.321
She hit Liza Minnelli
instead.

35:39.323 --> 35:41.240
(Laughs)
That's pretty bad.

35:41.242 --> 35:44.159
I feel like
such a failure.

35:44.161 --> 35:46.478
I tried so hard for
this perfect family holiday

35:46.480 --> 35:47.880
that no one even wanted.

35:47.882 --> 35:49.498
Well, my family stopped
trying a long time ago,

35:49.500 --> 35:52.651
and now we're not even
a family anymore.

35:52.653 --> 35:56.922
So I didn't completely
blow my air of mystery for you?

35:56.924 --> 35:58.874
Mystery's overrated.

35:58.876 --> 36:02.011

Hey.

36:18.112 --> 36:19.144
I saw the boyfriend.

36:19.146 --> 36:20.646
He's cute.

36:20.648 --> 36:22.698
You got room
for one more in here?

36:22.700 --> 36:24.533
Come on in.

36:24.535 --> 36:25.651
How was Walt's?

36:25.653 --> 36:27.870
The food... inedible.
The mood... repressed.

36:27.872 --> 36:29.521
How was here?

36:29.523 --> 36:31.957
Mm,
definitely not repressed.

36:31.959 --> 36:34.076
What's with the no lights?

No, it does suck.
I know it's cheesy,

37:36.221 --> 37:38.121

Thanksgiving.

37:38.123 --> 37:41.124
We used to go

37:43.245 --> 37:46.513
I always liked Thanksgiving
with my cousins, too.

37:46.515 --> 37:47.631
Is it crazy
that I sometimes think

37:47.633 --> 37:49.683
the money ruined everything?

37:49.685 --> 37:51.335
My mom stopped talking
to our brother,

37:51.337 --> 37:53.270
so I never see that side
of the family anymore.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.139
She got her new boobs
and nose,

37:56.141 --> 37:59.276
and it seems like
a whole new brain.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.427
It's like she doesn't care

38:00.429 --> 38:01.945

Thanksgiving anymore.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.815
But you do.

38:04.817 --> 38:08.168
And that's great...
That you still care.

38:12.106 --> 38:14.074
I was driving around,

38:14.076 --> 38:16.609
just thinking...

38:16.611 --> 38:18.045
And I realized you were
the person

38:18.047 --> 38:20.097
I really wanted to see.
I knew I could talk to you,

38:20.099 --> 38:23.583
and you'd get it.

38:23.585 --> 38:26.786
Do you ever wish
you could go back

38:26.788 --> 38:27.971
and change things?

38:27.973 --> 38:31.558
Choices that you made.

were mistakes?

38:34.463 --> 38:36.963

38:40.619 --> 38:43.704

38:43.706 --> 38:45.605
but that's not how life works.

38:45.607 --> 38:48.141
But you can't go back.

38:48.143 --> 38:51.662
Choices get made, and things
happen because of them.

38:56.868 --> 39:00.504
Yeah, well...
I guess I should go.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.327
You wanna come in?

39:07.329 --> 39:11.048
You can stay and eat.
We have ambrosia salad.

it wouldn't be weird?

39:16.722 --> 39:18.689
I don't think so.

39:21.976 --> 39:23.560
Yeah.
Maybe I should just go.

39:23.562 --> 39:27.180
Wait.
Just give me a minute.

39:27.182 --> 39:32.686
Um... I hope it's okay,
but his family isn't here.

39:35.907 --> 39:38.875
It's okay. Go on in.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.360
We got brie.

Uh... for you, sir.

39:50.089 --> 39:52.422
Thank you.

It's exactly what
I didn't need.

39:56.845 --> 39:58.595
Dad, before you say
anything,

39:58.597 --> 40:01.714
I didn't plan for him
to come over.

40:01.716 --> 40:03.100
But his mom left him
all alone,

40:03.102 --> 40:06.737
and he doesn't have
anywhere else to go.

40:06.739 --> 40:10.574
Well, no one should be alone
on Thanksgiving.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.892
And if you say you want to
invite him in,

40:12.894 --> 40:14.544
I trust that you have
a good reason.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.062
You do?

40:16.064 --> 40:17.614
You're a great kid,

who hasn't had much of a chance
to be a kid at all lately

40:19.935 --> 40:21.368

so hard

40:21.370 --> 40:22.986
to take care of this family.

40:25.373 --> 40:28.842
I don't want Thanksgiving
to be stressful for you

40:28.844 --> 40:30.343
in the way that it was
for your mom.

40:30.345 --> 40:33.130
Why does everyone know that mom
hated Thanksgiving but me?

40:33.132 --> 40:35.040
All this time,
I thought she loved it.

40:35.041 --> 40:36.050
She did love it.

40:36.051 --> 40:37.234
I mean, yeah,
it made her crazy,

40:37.236 --> 40:39.753
but sometimes the things
that we love the most

40:39.755 --> 40:42.639
make us the craziest
because we love them.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.757
("I feel the earth move"

40:44.759 --> 40:45.976
Well, cooking made me crazy,

40:45.978 --> 40:47.944
but definitely not because
I love it.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.663
