TRISH: <i>You're really</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:28.328
No. Look at the bubbles.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.765
He's‐he's‐he's got
excellent lung capacity.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.401
It runs in the family.
He‐he's fine.

00:34.401 --> 00:35.736
TRISH:
He's not fine.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.771
It's been three weeks
since he left school,

00:37.771 --> 00:39.540
and this is all he does.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.208
He floats. He sinks.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.709
He comes back in the
house for cereal.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.211
He goes back
out to the pool

00:44.211 --> 00:45.612
for more floating
and sinking.

00:45.612 --> 00:48.181
I mean, maybe he's training
to be a Navy SEAL.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.417
Or a real seal.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.418
Stop.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.886
Serious, I'm worried.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.288
<i>I think he's depressed.</i>

00:54.288 --> 00:56.890
We need to take him
to see a therapist.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.193
Therapy is for crazy people.

01:00.193 --> 01:01.295
RJ's not that.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.463
Riggs goes to therapy.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.566
You've been to therapy.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
That was different.

01:07.568 --> 01:11.238
That was a very specific
bedroom‐related glitch

01:11.238 --> 01:13.273
that has since been
straightened out.

01:13.273 --> 01:17.578
Mm. You and I are taking
RJ to the therapist today,

01:17.578 --> 01:22.115
or there will be a
brand‐new bedroom glitch.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.326
WOMAN:
<i>Martin.</i>

01:32.326 --> 01:34.428
Martin, help.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.430
Martin!

01:41.201 --> 01:43.270
Help me!

01:44.805 --> 01:45.606
Mom!

01:45.606 --> 01:47.741
<i>(gunshot)</i>

01:51.311 --> 01:52.879
(exhales)

02:08.562 --> 02:10.464
(gargling)

02:16.770 --> 02:18.472
Aah!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.140
Are you kidding me?!

02:20.140 --> 02:22.209
Ah, bud.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.610
These are the quietest
vehicles, man.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.212
I didn't even
hear you coming.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.547
You just spit juice
on me and my car.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.282
What the hell
is wrong with you?

02:29.282 --> 02:31.585
You know, there's no quick way
to answer that question,

02:31.585 --> 02:33.553
but relax;
I've got a rag in the truck.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.288
Oh, come...!

02:35.288 --> 02:36.323
You...
(groans)

02:36.323 --> 02:38.392
You scratched it!

02:38.392 --> 02:41.228
But I think we can both agree
that the parking places

02:41.228 --> 02:42.729
in this city are
way too small.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.431
Way too...
Hey, I don't care

02:44.431 --> 02:46.199
about the parking
spaces, okay?

02:46.199 --> 02:47.234
I care about my car.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.535
All right, just relax.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.337
Look, I‐I can buff this out.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.905
Ooh, you moron!

02:51.905 --> 02:53.573
You‐you did that
on purpose, huh?

02:53.573 --> 02:55.275
This is a custom
paint job.

02:55.275 --> 02:58.211
Well, this was my hangover cure.
All right? So...

02:58.211 --> 03:00.213
No winners here.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.548
Yeah, no, only losers.

03:06.553 --> 03:10.524
W‐W‐Where the hell do you
think you're going, huh?

03:10.524 --> 03:12.559
(engine starts)
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:12.559 --> 03:14.728
Hey! You're gonna pay
for this scratch,

03:14.728 --> 03:17.130
the detailing and my suit!

03:17.130 --> 03:18.298
All right.

03:18.298 --> 03:20.567
No! (shouting)

03:21.601 --> 03:22.903
See? I'm a moron, right?

03:22.903 --> 03:25.305
Come on!
Look at that.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.740
Right?

03:26.740 --> 03:29.609
No, no, no! Aah! Ooh!

03:29.609 --> 03:31.111
And a loser.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.181
You're not gonna get away
with this.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.515
Do you know who I am?

03:35.515 --> 03:37.551
I'm getting a pretty good idea.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.453
You should be in an institution!

03:39.453 --> 03:41.254
Probably right.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.324
Aah!

03:44.324 --> 03:46.226
SAMUELS: <i>Dr. Cahill,</i>
<i>thank you for coming.</i>

03:46.226 --> 03:47.627
<i>Your patient is currently</i>
<i>in isolation.</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:50.297
Doesn't make sense.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.865
I mean, he'd been
making progress.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.066
The mania was
under control.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.204
He was, until he put his fist
through the pharmacy window.

03:57.204 --> 04:00.173
Stanley was not a patient
at risk for suicide.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.441
He showed no signs.

04:01.441 --> 04:05.212
Except the fact that he was in
a mental hospital to begin with.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.881
Stanley?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.249
(door closes)

04:09.249 --> 04:11.251
Last time I saw you,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.652
you were doing well.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.588
What happened?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.691
Is it okay if I...

04:19.559 --> 04:21.695
...if I gave you a hug?

04:23.797 --> 04:25.432
Yeah.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.534
Of course.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.438
Stanley,
what are you doing?
I'm sorry.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.440
Stanley, what are you doing?!

04:33.440 --> 04:36.743
Stanley, what
are you doing?!

04:36.743 --> 04:39.446
Shh, Doctor.
I don't want to hurt you.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.715
I don't want to hurt you.
(grunts)

04:43.583 --> 04:45.685
Stanley, please just
think about this.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.821
Please.
Stop talking.

04:54.327 --> 04:55.495
God.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.897
Get your badge out.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.532
Get your badge out!
Okay, okay!

04:58.532 --> 05:00.167
Okay, okay, okay.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.535
Right here, right here.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.737
Get your...

ALAN:
Aah! Ooh!

05:09.276 --> 05:10.544
RIGGS:
And a loser.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.812
It's a fender
bender, really.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.481
That is not
a fender bender.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.683
Technically, you're right.
There was no fender.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.286
It's like a smartphone
with wheels. It was...
God.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.453
What's wrong, Cap?

05:20.453 --> 05:24.624
It's not even noon, Riggs,
and I'm staring into the abyss.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.226
The guy whose car
you destroyed,

05:26.226 --> 05:29.229
do you have any idea who he is,
what he does for a living?

05:29.229 --> 05:31.565
Is he a chimney sweep?
Aah.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.666
I hate chimney sweeps.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.268
Try deputy mayor.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.536
RIGGS:
Deputy mayor?

05:36.536 --> 05:38.138
Of what?
The city of Douchebaggery?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.105
Of Los Angeles.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.907
The phone calls
I've been getting all morning,

05:40.907 --> 05:43.243
I'm‐I'm‐I'm
physically nauseous.

05:43.243 --> 05:46.313
Oh, come on, Cap.
We've been through worse.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.848
Buck up.
Ah, I deluded myself.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.217
I thought you were less crazy,
less angry.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.618
I'm less angry.
No, you're not.

05:51.618 --> 05:52.686
(laughing):
You know, actually,

05:52.686 --> 05:55.188
I woke up this morning
whistling.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.258
RIGGS: Well, that's just not
a healthy way to live, Captain.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.327
I mean, you got nowhere
to go but down.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.461
Now I know.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.662
(phone ringing)

06:02.662 --> 06:05.498
There it is.
The sound of my bubble bursting.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.100
(cell phones ringing)

06:07.100 --> 06:09.035
We have a situation.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.807
<i>(sirens wailing)</i>

06:22.716 --> 06:25.285
Are we sure she's...?
We'll find out.

06:25.285 --> 06:29.189
We found the car underneath
the Colorado Street Bridge

06:29.189 --> 06:31.057
near the 134.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.741
(knocking, muffled grunting)

06:47.741 --> 06:50.443
Hey, Riggs, I got something.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.178
Yeah, me, too.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.521
RIGGS: Hey, Doc.
How are you?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.224
Where is he?

07:04.224 --> 07:05.659
I'm gonna kill him!

07:05.659 --> 07:08.561
Think somebody
already beat you to it.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.106
♪ ♪

07:23.143 --> 07:26.279
We drove for 40,
maybe 45 minutes

07:26.279 --> 07:28.348
before he pulled over
to‐to make a phone call.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.216
It must've been
a pay phone.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.184
You know who he called?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.286
I don't know. I‐I‐I
didn't hear any names.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.589
I just heard him screaming at
someone to bring him money.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.425
We find out
who he called,

07:38.425 --> 07:41.161
we find out
who killed him.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.897
What the hell are you doing?
What is all this?

07:43.897 --> 07:45.298
I'm making tea.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.833
Tea? She was in
the trunk of a car.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.435
She needs something
a little stronger than tea.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.837
I know, and tea
is soothing.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.505
In fact, you should try some.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.573
I'm gonna karate chop you
in the throat.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.208
It doesn't make any sense.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.243
I know. Let me grab
some whiskey under my desk.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.511
No, it doesn't, it
doesn't make sense.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.481
Stanley was busted for stealing
jewelry from‐from empty houses.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.782
He wasn't violent.
He was bipolar.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.086
That's why he was in a hospital
and not prison to begin with.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.222
I‐I actually thought
I was helping him.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.256
Drink some tea.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.193
Hey, come on, Doc.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.394
You were helping him.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.129
In what world?

08:16.129 --> 08:17.197
He duped me.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.033
He staged a suicide
so I would help him get out.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.510
(whispering): Say something.
Say something.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.245
Be encouraging.
Say something.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.646
Oh.

08:33.646 --> 08:36.549
Doc, come‐come on.

08:36.549 --> 08:39.152
You're aces
at this therapy game.

08:39.152 --> 08:42.255
You know, hey,
look how far I've come along.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.090
Right?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.362
ALAN:
No, no, no!

08:49.362 --> 08:51.164
SANTOS:
As an institution,

08:51.164 --> 08:53.700
we're running out of words
to describe him.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.736
He's an‐an unfixable
force of chaos.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.839
Do you know where I was
24 hours ago?

08:59.839 --> 09:02.575
On a cruise ship in Fiji.

09:02.575 --> 09:04.644
My first vacation in 14 years.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.379
I've heard good
things about Fiji.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.282
I thought Riggs
was doing better.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.850
Maybe this is
a turning point.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.318
No.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.387
Someday, we'll be gone.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.423
And our legacy?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.658
We allowed a detective
to crumble

09:18.658 --> 09:22.295
the third largest police
department in the country.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.663
Tell me he's still seeing

09:23.663 --> 09:25.532
the department psychiatrist.
Intensively.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.167
Oh, good. I want
to hear from her.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.202
It's not a good time
'cause Dr. Cahill's...

09:29.202 --> 09:30.503
Oh, I don't care.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.406
We are in uncharted waters.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.545
I got a lead on the...
Shh.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.813
Bowman's reading lips.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.514
Okay, so why do I
have to be quiet?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.150
Because we're trying
to figure out

09:44.150 --> 09:45.785
what Avery and Gina
are discussing.

09:45.785 --> 09:48.221
You're trying to figure out
if they're talking about you

09:48.221 --> 09:51.124
because you think everyone
is always talking about you.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.693
Gina said,
"What about Murtaugh?"

09:55.562 --> 09:57.230
MURTAUGH:
See?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.498
Usually I'm right.

09:58.498 --> 09:59.732
"Murtaugh

09:59.732 --> 10:02.302
is supposed to be a good
influence on Riggs."

10:02.302 --> 10:03.603
Oh, it's my fault?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.138
That guy was broken

10:05.138 --> 10:06.639
way before he got to me.

10:08.675 --> 10:09.943
Who's the suspect?

10:09.943 --> 10:13.246
Stanley only had one visitor the
entire time he was locked up,

10:13.246 --> 10:14.581
an ex‐con named Carl Edwards.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.249
What'd he do time for?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.383
He did B&Es
with Stanley.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.419
They had a falling out, and
last time Carl visited,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.688
orderlies overheard him
threatening Stanley's life.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.356
Okay. Some actual police work.

10:23.356 --> 10:26.159
Go find me Carl Edwards.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.595
"Is there anyone

10:28.595 --> 10:30.597
older we can
put with Riggs?"

10:30.597 --> 10:33.333
Avery: "No.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.669
Murtaugh's the oldest
we've got."

10:36.669 --> 10:39.405
You know what, he didn't
say‐‐ Who said that?

10:39.405 --> 10:41.341
Avery just said that.
Read his lips again.

10:41.341 --> 10:44.144
He didn't say that.
I can't read the lips again.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.880
RIGGS:
<i>They're wrong.</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:48.081
Really?

10:48.081 --> 10:51.951
Avery's wrong and Gina's wrong
and the deputy mayor's wrong?

10:51.951 --> 10:53.753
And I don't care.
Say that, then.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.889
I'll say that next time.
Let me ask you a question.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.790
And there's no wrong
answer here, okay?

10:57.790 --> 10:58.725
Yeah?

10:58.725 --> 11:02.362
Since we met, would
you say that I'm...

11:02.362 --> 11:05.198
A) more angry,
or B) less angry?

11:05.198 --> 11:06.699
I'd say C) same angry.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.269
You said there was
no such thing as wrong.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.203
I lied.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.338
Rog.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.507
Clearly, I'm less angry.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.242
I'd say more angry.

11:16.242 --> 11:19.312
You know what?
The old me would've flipped out.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.248
Definitely much more angry.

Look, we're gonna go
get Carl Edwards,

11:36.462 --> 11:38.565
get out, minimal damage.

11:38.565 --> 11:42.435
I'm gonna show you
how I'm less angry.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.470
Watch it, bro.
Oh. Forgive me, sir.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.339
(quietly):
Less angry.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.874
Less angry.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.611
Hey, everybody, we're
looking for Carl Edwards.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.479
Who's asking?

11:53.479 --> 11:54.747
Oh, just your
friendly boys in blue.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.549
Uh, well, I guess we're not‐‐
Is this blue?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.884
Um, I got blue. Yeah.
This is black.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.286
I know. That's the...
I'm Carl Edwards.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.188
Oh.
Okay, well, we need
to ask you...

12:02.188 --> 12:03.223
MAN:
No.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.325

Ah. You see
what's happening here?
Yeah.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.264
Hey.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.599
I'm with Carl Edwards.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.235
But I'm also
Carl Edwards.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.469
Dick.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.905
Hmm. Okay, well...

12:18.905 --> 12:20.607
(chuckles)
It's very funny, guys,

12:20.607 --> 12:23.643
but we're actually looking
for the real Carl Edwards.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.178
We have a few questions,
that's all.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.746
Why don't you just say
that I'm less angry

12:26.746 --> 12:28.448
so we can handle this properly?
I'm not gonna say that.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.515
Why can't you say that?

12:29.515 --> 12:30.917
(people oohing)

12:30.917 --> 12:34.220
I'm Carl Edwards.
Put it on my tab.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.389
My goodness.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.457
Look at this.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.758
See what's happening?
Yeah.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.261
See, I'm not angry.
They're the angry ones.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.331

Not Carl Edwards.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.563
MURTAUGH:
Not Carl Edwards.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.232
RIGGS:
Not Carl Edwards.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.167
Did I just hear my name?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.270
What happened in here?

13:24.270 --> 13:25.138
MURTAUGH:
Carl Edwards?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.572
LAPD.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.441
Need to talk to you
about Stanley Oliver.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.476
Stan Oliver.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.778
Hate that guy.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.646
Huh. He was murdered yesterday.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.248
CARL:
No kidding.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.783
That's fantastic.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.218
(chuckles)
Carl, let me ask you a question.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.254
I‐I know we just met,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.423
but do I seem like
the kind of guy that's getting

13:43.423 --> 13:45.124
less angry or more angry?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.194
Say "less angry."

13:56.226 --> 13:59.229
So, Stan the man
got himself shot.

13:59.229 --> 14:02.365
Tell me, how
many bullets?

14:02.365 --> 14:03.433
One to the head.

14:03.433 --> 14:06.069
Huh. Not for nothing,
I would've given him two.

14:06.069 --> 14:07.937
Probably more.

14:07.937 --> 14:10.974
Carl, where were you
yesterday, around 2:30?

14:10.974 --> 14:13.810
Don't worry about it.
I'm covered.

14:13.810 --> 14:15.144
Hey, don't worry about it.

14:15.144 --> 14:16.779
He's covered. Okay.
He's covered.

14:16.779 --> 14:18.982
Look, you guys know
<i>The Price Is Right?</i>

14:18.982 --> 14:20.416
The TV show?

14:20.416 --> 14:21.618
(laughs)

14:21.618 --> 14:24.654
Your alibi is you were watching
<i>The Price is Right?</i>

14:24.654 --> 14:26.422
You're gonna have to
come better than that.

14:26.422 --> 14:30.293
No. My alibi is I was on
<i>The Price Is Right.</i>

14:31.728 --> 14:33.663
That's the best alibi
I've heard all day.

14:33.663 --> 14:35.198
That's pretty good.

14:35.198 --> 14:36.900
Get the tape.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.968
So, how'd you do?

14:38.968 --> 14:42.805
A classic living room set,
four pieces.

14:42.805 --> 14:45.909
Couch, loveseat,
easy chair, ottoman.

14:45.909 --> 14:47.176
How much?

14:47.176 --> 14:49.345
Was it leather?
Automatic or manual recliner?

14:49.345 --> 14:53.683
Naugahyde,
manual recline, tufted pillows.

14:53.683 --> 14:55.451
Eh, I'll say $1,900.

14:55.451 --> 14:56.686
One dollar.

14:56.686 --> 14:57.520
One dollar?

14:57.520 --> 14:58.221
Do you not know
how the game works?

14:58.221 --> 14:59.756
Where do you shop for a dollar?

14:59.756 --> 15:01.257
You're gonna overbid...
Forget the game.

15:01.257 --> 15:02.692
2,200.

15:02.692 --> 15:03.326
Yeah.

15:03.326 --> 15:04.761
I overbid.
He overbid.

15:04.761 --> 15:06.062
And you underbid.

15:06.062 --> 15:07.764
I would've won.
I walked out
with nothing

15:07.764 --> 15:10.700
but a stupid Jet Ski
I can't even pay the taxes on,

15:10.700 --> 15:12.702
which, not for nothing,
is Stan's fault.

15:12.702 --> 15:13.903
How's that?

15:13.903 --> 15:16.706
We did a job together.

15:16.706 --> 15:17.907
Ripped off this mansion

15:17.907 --> 15:19.709
in Pasadena.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.946
I was supposed to fence the
jewelry, but Stan screwed me.

15:22.946 --> 15:24.681
He went off to the loony bin,

15:24.681 --> 15:26.816
and told me
he found a new fence.

15:26.816 --> 15:27.951
This fence have a name?

15:27.951 --> 15:29.419
No.

15:29.419 --> 15:31.354
But I'll bet you
one unused Jet Ski

15:31.354 --> 15:33.222
he's the guy who shot Stan.

15:36.025 --> 15:37.794
RIGGS:
<i>I am such a moron!</i>

15:37.794 --> 15:40.997
ALAN: Come on!
RIGGS: Look at that!

15:40.997 --> 15:43.666
(tires screeching)
No, no, no!

15:43.666 --> 15:46.703
Mm. This was yesterday?

15:46.703 --> 15:48.304
Before work.

15:48.304 --> 15:51.774
We have some decisions
to make.

15:51.774 --> 15:53.309
An affidavit?

15:53.309 --> 15:55.411
Mm‐hmm. Attesting to the fact

15:55.411 --> 15:57.914
that Detective Riggs
is mentally fit

15:57.914 --> 15:59.849
to continue working
for the LAPD.

15:59.849 --> 16:02.752
Don't my reports
already attest to that?

16:02.752 --> 16:05.989
Well, under
normal circumstances.

16:05.989 --> 16:07.623
But we're past that now.

16:07.623 --> 16:11.661
If you sign this,
Detective Riggs stays.

16:11.661 --> 16:15.131
And his behavior becomes
your responsibility.

16:15.131 --> 16:17.800
Or don't sign it, and he's gone.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.002
Problem solved.

16:19.002 --> 16:23.806
That seems
fairly straightforward.

16:23.806 --> 16:28.711
This is your
professional reputation.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.780
Think about it.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.016
You can give me
your answer tomorrow.

16:37.086 --> 16:38.888
CAHILL:
<i>The deputy mayor?</i>

16:38.888 --> 16:41.657
Riggs, I just saw the tape.
What is wrong with you?

16:41.657 --> 16:43.760
I don't know.
You know me better than anybody.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.962
I should, but I‐I don't.

16:45.962 --> 16:48.264
Truly, Riggs,
I‐I'm at a loss here.

16:48.264 --> 16:50.133
Should we be having
this conversation down here

16:50.133 --> 16:51.334
in front of everyone?
Does it matter?

16:51.334 --> 16:53.036
I mean, you can avoid
your crap down here

16:53.036 --> 16:54.003
as easily as you can upstairs.

16:54.003 --> 16:55.271
You know what, Doc?
Why‐why don't you say it

16:55.271 --> 16:58.074
a little louder; I don't think
the guys up in vice heard you.

16:58.074 --> 17:00.176
You should see yourself
on that tape, Riggs.

17:00.176 --> 17:02.378
You are so damn angry,

17:02.378 --> 17:05.181
and you are too terrified
to find out why.

17:06.649 --> 17:08.918
Go look around, Doc,
everybody's angry.

17:08.918 --> 17:11.954
Not everyone's my patient.

17:11.954 --> 17:13.956
(Bailey clears throat)

17:13.956 --> 17:15.191
BAILEY:
Good news.

17:15.191 --> 17:16.125
We tracked down the pay phone

17:16.125 --> 17:18.127
and got the name
of the fence Stan called.

17:18.127 --> 17:19.595
Jose Esparza.

17:21.731 --> 17:24.767
Please tell me
that you're joking.

17:24.767 --> 17:27.036
Have you met Bailey?

17:27.036 --> 17:28.638
She doesn't joke around.

17:28.638 --> 17:30.139
(sighs)

17:30.139 --> 17:32.175
Jose was my patient.

17:32.175 --> 17:34.777
And Stanley's roommate
at the psych facility.

17:34.777 --> 17:36.913
Well, at least we're keeping it
in the family.

17:36.913 --> 17:40.016
BAILEY: We have a P. O. box,
but no current address.

17:40.016 --> 17:41.284
His last whereabouts are...

17:41.284 --> 17:43.386
I have his number
right here.

17:43.386 --> 17:45.088
Hey, hey, what are you...?
What are you doing?

17:45.088 --> 17:46.255
You can't just
make a phone call.

17:46.255 --> 17:47.790
That's not how
police work... works.

17:47.790 --> 17:49.192
Uh, J‐Jose.

17:49.192 --> 17:51.661
Uh, yes, it's‐it's
Dr. Cahill.

17:51.661 --> 17:54.864
Um, I‐I just, I‐I
wanted to check in.

17:54.864 --> 17:56.232
It's been a while.

17:56.232 --> 17:58.301
Um, thought we should
schedule an appointment.

17:59.368 --> 18:02.071
Yeah. That's‐that's perfect.
Um...

18:02.071 --> 18:05.074
I can, I can
come to you.

18:05.074 --> 18:06.976
See you in 30.

18:08.778 --> 18:10.913
(power tools whirring,
jackhammer drilling)

18:16.018 --> 18:18.354
So she just called up
the suspect,

18:18.354 --> 18:20.256
(over radio): and he said
he would meet her?

18:20.256 --> 18:22.325
I know. Ridiculous, right?

18:22.325 --> 18:23.759
I think we're doing
something wrong.

18:23.759 --> 18:24.794
No, Rog.

18:24.794 --> 18:27.630
We should not have a shrink
in the field with us.

18:27.630 --> 18:29.065
You know I can
hear you, right?

18:29.065 --> 18:31.167
RIGGS: Oh, it's like
you're in my head, Doc.

18:31.167 --> 18:33.269
CAHILL: Riggs, this is
not my first rodeo.

18:33.269 --> 18:36.172
Heads up, guys.
We got a live one.

18:36.172 --> 18:37.306
RIGGS:
You ever been to a rodeo, Doc?

18:37.306 --> 18:39.342
By the way, I am perfectly
comfortable in the field.

18:39.342 --> 18:42.011
RIGGS: Well, I'm pretty sure
your field's a little different

18:42.011 --> 18:43.679
from my field.

18:45.681 --> 18:47.416
You brought the cops?

18:47.416 --> 18:49.152
Hey, I just want to ask you
a couple of questions...

18:49.152 --> 18:50.820
(horn honks, tires screech)

18:50.820 --> 18:52.321
Hey, watch it, man!

18:54.724 --> 18:56.659
Where does he think he's going?

18:56.659 --> 18:58.027
The crazy ones,
they always climb.

20:00.823 --> 20:02.024
Look at me, Jose.

20:02.024 --> 20:03.993
Hey, Jose.
Come on.

20:03.993 --> 20:05.661
So you've been
going to see Cahill.

20:05.661 --> 20:06.662
Back off!

20:06.662 --> 20:08.331
What the hell is he doing?

20:08.331 --> 20:09.198
Back off!

20:09.198 --> 20:11.834
Look, you're running out
of real estate.

20:11.834 --> 20:12.902
All right?

20:12.902 --> 20:13.936
CAHILL:
Oh, my God.

20:13.936 --> 20:15.004
He's gonna fall.

20:15.004 --> 20:16.272
Riggs!

20:16.272 --> 20:17.306
You're scaring Cahill.

20:17.306 --> 20:19.675
Guys, get out of here! Go!

20:20.810 --> 20:23.045
(shouts, screaming)

20:28.784 --> 20:29.952
(loud crash)

20:47.332 --> 20:50.335
What could they be
possibly talking about?

20:50.335 --> 20:52.204
He's in there for
such a long time.

20:52.204 --> 20:53.872
What he needs to talk about.

20:53.872 --> 20:55.207
Shh.

20:55.207 --> 20:56.842
I think I just heard him
say "Dad."

20:56.842 --> 20:59.344
(whispers):
Roger, stop it and sit down.

20:59.344 --> 21:00.612
I bet this is about the time

21:00.612 --> 21:02.247
that I didn't
play catch with him.

21:02.247 --> 21:04.516
Or‐or when I took his
quarters on poker night

21:04.516 --> 21:06.685
and told him that
it was the tooth fairy.

21:09.287 --> 21:10.322
Oh.

21:10.322 --> 21:12.124
(soft laughter)
PEGGY: You okay?

21:12.124 --> 21:13.658
Just admiring your door.

21:13.658 --> 21:14.860
(Murtaugh and Trish chuckle)

21:14.860 --> 21:16.194
MURTAUGH:
It's wood.

21:16.194 --> 21:17.529
How are you, sweetie?

21:17.529 --> 21:19.865
Feeling good.
You know, better.

21:19.865 --> 21:21.333
Okay, good.
Good, good.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.634
Yeah, he's a
terrific kid.

21:22.634 --> 21:24.669
Yeah, he's great. He is.

21:24.669 --> 21:28.273
Okay, Roger, Trish.
Your turn?

21:28.273 --> 21:29.141
Us?

21:29.141 --> 21:30.342
Yeah.

21:32.277 --> 21:34.179
(sighs)

21:34.179 --> 21:36.481
So, uh, full disclosure.

21:36.481 --> 21:40.285
Uh, RJ was our
first kid, so, uh,

21:40.285 --> 21:42.487
needless to say,
mistakes were made.

21:42.487 --> 21:44.623
Right? Yeah.

21:44.623 --> 21:49.194
Well, RJ asked me
to talk to you.

21:49.194 --> 21:51.763
The good news is
he's gonna be fine.

21:51.763 --> 21:53.231
Okay.

21:53.231 --> 21:54.499
(laughs)
That's a relief.

21:54.499 --> 21:55.700
But he has been

21:55.700 --> 21:57.469
feeling very acutely

21:57.469 --> 21:59.938
your sense
of disappointment in him

21:59.938 --> 22:02.340
for having dropped out
of school.

22:02.340 --> 22:05.110
Oh, no.

22:05.110 --> 22:07.145
We're the opposite
of that.

22:07.145 --> 22:10.649
RJ told me he overheard you
telling the mailman

22:10.649 --> 22:13.585
that he was home because
he has a rare tropical disease.

22:16.721 --> 22:19.157
You know that Doug likes
to spread gossip.

22:19.157 --> 22:22.227
You know, he's so judgmental.
You told him he
had a disease?

22:27.866 --> 22:29.267
Um...

22:29.267 --> 22:31.169
she dropped RJ

22:31.169 --> 22:33.672
on his head
when he was just a baby.

22:33.672 --> 22:36.441
Her, not me.

22:36.441 --> 22:39.311
I tried to catch him.
She said, "No, leave him.

22:39.311 --> 22:41.580
He'll sleep
through the night."

22:42.814 --> 22:45.150
BAILEY: <i>So, Scorsese,</i>
<i>what do we got?</i>

22:45.150 --> 22:47.719
Drug‐wise, nothing is
out of the ordinary

22:47.719 --> 22:50.322
with Jose's system
as well as Stanley's.

22:50.322 --> 22:52.724
Both tox reports, clean.

22:52.724 --> 22:54.259
That makes no sense.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.697
Cahill was treating
Stanley with SSRIs

22:58.697 --> 23:01.199
and anti‐anxiety meds.
Jose, too. Lithium.

23:01.199 --> 23:03.768
Even if he stopped taking it
after he left the facility,

23:03.768 --> 23:05.136
there should still be traces.

23:05.136 --> 23:08.640
Which is why I asked you‐‐
not so much‐‐

23:08.640 --> 23:10.242
<i>you</i> down here.

23:10.242 --> 23:11.243
Are you sure I can't
pour you a ginger ale?

23:11.243 --> 23:12.310
No.
Okay, maybe...

23:12.310 --> 23:14.145
Scorsese, it will
always be no.

23:14.145 --> 23:15.280
Rain check.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.582
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:17.582 --> 23:19.885
Hands off the Jarlsberg.

23:19.885 --> 23:21.186
Not for you.

23:21.186 --> 23:22.487
May I have a fig?

23:22.487 --> 23:24.389
Get out.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.792
Good, you're still...

23:27.792 --> 23:29.527
CAHILL:
Look who it is.

23:29.527 --> 23:31.363
Scotch?

23:31.363 --> 23:34.065
Sure.

23:38.670 --> 23:40.138
Cheers.

23:40.138 --> 23:42.674
To failing
all of my patients.

23:42.674 --> 23:46.578
Or... to finding out
that Stan and Jose

23:46.578 --> 23:48.546
were not taking
their meds.

23:48.546 --> 23:50.448
Excuse me?

23:51.917 --> 23:53.351
Not a drop of 'em.

23:53.351 --> 23:56.254
Which means it's not
your fault they snapped.

23:57.923 --> 24:00.258
So I missed that, too.

24:03.094 --> 24:05.664
I thought I was helping them.

24:05.664 --> 24:08.199
I thought that
I was helping you.

24:09.668 --> 24:12.604
Come on, Doc, I know it doesn't
always look like it...

24:12.604 --> 24:14.539
No, it doesn't.

24:14.539 --> 24:17.475
Because you're not trying.
But it's‐it's not your fault.

24:17.475 --> 24:20.211
You see, it‐it's my fault.
That's the truth.

24:20.211 --> 24:23.148
I just, I‐I can't
get through to you.

24:23.148 --> 24:25.250
(sighs)

24:25.250 --> 24:27.886
I think I've made you worse.

24:27.886 --> 24:31.256
Come on, Doc.

24:31.256 --> 24:34.459
I'm getting better.
It's just baby steps.

24:34.459 --> 24:38.196
I do wish that were true.

24:46.304 --> 24:50.275
I saw you with Jose.

24:50.275 --> 24:53.645
You like it up there.

24:53.645 --> 24:57.182
Inches from death, so...

24:57.182 --> 24:59.317
close to the edge.

25:02.153 --> 25:04.289
You're so angry.

25:05.824 --> 25:09.361
One day, it'll kill you.

25:14.199 --> 25:16.701
And I won't know why.

25:19.537 --> 25:22.674
It's like the anger's
always been there.

25:22.674 --> 25:24.609
(clears throat)

25:24.609 --> 25:27.746
I mean, not when
I was a kid, you know.

25:30.281 --> 25:32.617
Certainly after my mom passed.

25:36.654 --> 25:41.292
It's like a...
like a fire, you know.

25:46.197 --> 25:47.732
Sometimes I get so hot,

25:47.732 --> 25:50.769
I just want to jump outside
of myself, you know.

25:50.769 --> 25:54.172
(breathes deeply)

26:16.795 --> 26:18.730
(whispers):
Night, Doctor.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.739
(Riggs whistling
"Oh My Darling, Clementine")

26:27.739 --> 26:29.607
(door closes)

26:29.607 --> 26:31.609
Stop. No, stop, please.

26:31.609 --> 26:33.144
Stop whistling.

26:33.144 --> 26:34.712
No? You sure?

26:34.712 --> 26:36.815
'Cause I also know some <i>Bonanza.</i>

26:36.815 --> 26:41.152
Oh, I can't believe I...
I drank so much.

26:41.152 --> 26:42.654
(groans)

26:42.654 --> 26:45.557
What is that?

26:45.557 --> 26:48.693
This...
is a hangover cure.

26:50.595 --> 26:53.164
You said something last night.

26:53.164 --> 26:56.401
Oh.

26:56.401 --> 26:57.702
Thought you were asleep.

26:57.702 --> 27:02.407
About, uh, Jose and‐and Stanley
and the‐the tox reports. Why?

27:02.407 --> 27:04.676
Oh, clean as a whistle.

27:04.676 --> 27:07.545
Those guys never avoided
taking their meds.

27:07.545 --> 27:09.614
And even if they had,
the facility

27:09.614 --> 27:12.851
and Dr. Samuels, they‐they
had protocols in place.

27:12.851 --> 27:16.521
What do you think
the street value

27:16.521 --> 27:18.223
of those drugs are?

27:22.594 --> 27:25.263
It's a depressing tox report
for sure,

27:25.263 --> 27:26.731
but not surprising.

27:26.731 --> 27:28.500
Every year, our
patients find new ways

27:28.500 --> 27:29.701
to avoid taking
their meds.

27:29.701 --> 27:31.669
The stories I could tell.

27:31.669 --> 27:33.171
I'll bet you could.

27:33.171 --> 27:36.474
Hey, Captain, could I
borrow you for a minute?

27:36.474 --> 27:37.709
Yeah.
Fine with me.

27:37.709 --> 27:38.877
I should probably
get going.

27:38.877 --> 27:41.646
Actually, Doc,
could you hang out a sec?

27:41.646 --> 27:43.548
We, uh, got some
paperwork to do.

27:43.548 --> 27:44.549
Paperwork?

27:44.549 --> 27:46.684
I signed the report.

27:46.684 --> 27:47.785
Anything else
can be e‐mailed.

27:47.785 --> 27:50.889
Well, these are, um,
these are sensitive debriefs.

27:50.889 --> 27:51.990
They can't be sent
electronically.

27:51.990 --> 27:55.660
But I, and I still want
to hear some of those stories.

27:55.660 --> 27:56.895
BAILEY:
<i>They guy's dirty.</i>

27:56.895 --> 27:59.764
He makes 47K a year
at a psych facility,

27:59.764 --> 28:00.632
but has an offshore account

28:00.632 --> 28:02.634
and just bought a condo
in Palm Desert.

28:02.634 --> 28:04.502
And a Ferrari.
Rosso Corsa.

28:04.502 --> 28:06.304
That's "red" in Ferrari.

28:06.304 --> 28:08.540
I really should be
hitting the road.

28:08.540 --> 28:11.376
Oh, please, Dr. Samuels.
We just put in your lunch order.

28:11.376 --> 28:12.544
We're having dumplings.

28:12.544 --> 28:13.645
AVERY:
You're gonna love the dumplings.

28:13.645 --> 28:15.380
You don't want to miss
the dumplings; they're so good.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.414
In a second.

28:16.414 --> 28:18.650
So, you think he's taking
the patients' meds?

28:18.650 --> 28:20.518
He's replacing them
with placebos

28:20.518 --> 28:21.819
and selling them on the street.

28:21.819 --> 28:24.222
You figure 30 a pill,
two a day,

28:24.222 --> 28:27.692
about 55 patients‐‐
he's making an easy...

28:27.692 --> 28:29.060
million a year.

28:30.395 --> 28:31.729
And you think Stanley found out,

28:31.729 --> 28:33.364
and that's why
he broke out.

28:33.364 --> 28:34.432
It's possible.
If he did,

28:34.432 --> 28:36.167
Dr. Samuels would definitely
want to keep him quiet.

28:36.167 --> 28:37.402
Okay, look,
we can't hold him,

28:37.402 --> 28:39.604
because we only have a theory;
we don't have any evidence.

28:39.604 --> 28:41.139
We need somebody
on the inside.

28:41.139 --> 28:42.607
AVERY: Are you
thinking an orderly?

28:46.578 --> 28:49.647
No. I'm thinking a patient.

28:49.647 --> 28:51.883
Hypothetically,

28:51.883 --> 28:54.786
would punching his
captain in the face

28:54.786 --> 28:57.155
get a cop thrown into
a psych ward?

29:01.659 --> 29:04.062
Depends on the cop.

29:04.062 --> 29:06.698
Isn't there any other way?

29:06.698 --> 29:08.600
(elevator bell dings)

29:10.168 --> 29:12.237
(chuckles)

29:12.237 --> 29:14.172
Well, I have to say,

29:14.172 --> 29:17.508
I'm kind of surprised
you signed.

29:17.508 --> 29:19.477
Why? Because I stand
by my patient,

29:19.477 --> 29:22.213
or because I'm willing
to risk my career for it?

29:22.213 --> 29:24.449
Dr. Cahill,
if you don't believe that...

29:24.449 --> 29:27.752
Riggs has demons that he has not
been able to slay yet,

29:27.752 --> 29:31.823
but I don't believe that
he's a danger to others.

29:31.823 --> 29:33.625
We're better off
with him out there.

29:33.625 --> 29:36.661
Mm. I hope you're right.

29:36.661 --> 29:39.530
Dr. Samuels, the captain
wanted to apologize

29:39.530 --> 29:41.432
for taking up
so much of your time.

29:41.432 --> 29:42.367
RIGGS:
A dress code?

29:42.367 --> 29:44.702
A God‐dang dress code?!
It is not a code,

29:44.702 --> 29:46.504
it's a suggestion.
You know what?

29:46.504 --> 29:48.506
What's happening there?
That's all you do

29:48.506 --> 29:49.374
is make suggestions.

29:49.374 --> 29:50.608
(quietly):
Tell me when it's coming.

29:50.608 --> 29:51.609
You know what?

29:51.609 --> 29:53.344
I'm done with your suggestions.

29:53.344 --> 29:55.680
And why don't I write it across
your forehead with a marker?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.448
AVERY: Riggs, I need
you to step back

29:57.448 --> 29:59.517
and calm down.

29:59.517 --> 30:01.119
RIGGS:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:01.119 --> 30:02.720
Did you just tell me
to calm down?
I did.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.722
Step back and calm down.

30:05.556 --> 30:08.192
Oh!

30:08.192 --> 30:09.727
I just have really
good reflexes.

30:09.727 --> 30:12.730
Detective, that
man needs help.

30:13.765 --> 30:15.433
(groans):
What happened?

30:15.433 --> 30:17.669
He's your problem now.

30:18.803 --> 30:20.705
I've got it in writing.

30:27.681 --> 30:30.117
Boots, belt,
all possessions in the box.

30:31.818 --> 30:32.953
(door buzzes)

30:32.953 --> 30:34.888
Welcome to Copeland.

30:37.691 --> 30:39.693
CAHILL:
<i>Well, they bought it.</i>

30:39.693 --> 30:41.028
Why didn't you
tell me the plan

30:41.028 --> 30:43.664
before putting on
that awful display?

30:43.664 --> 30:45.132
Uh, there wasn't
enough time.

30:45.132 --> 30:48.235
Samuels needed to see it.
We needed him to believe.

30:48.235 --> 30:51.672
Did Riggs think I wouldn't
let him go through with it?

30:51.672 --> 30:53.206
It'll work out.

30:53.206 --> 30:56.076
His room's unlocked
for an activity hour.

30:56.076 --> 30:58.912
He'll get into the pharmacy,
find the placebos,

30:58.912 --> 31:01.848
