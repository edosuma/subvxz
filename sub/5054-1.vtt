<i>Everyone is born,</i>

00:46.255 --> 00:48.599
<i>but not everyone
is born the same.</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:52.978
<i>Some will grow to be butchers
or bakers or candlestick makers.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:56.811
<i>Some will only be really good
at making Jell-O salad.</i>

00:56.974 --> 01:01.024
<i>One way or another, though,
every human being is unique,</i>

01:01.186 --> 01:03.530
<i>for better or for worse.</i>

01:04.897 --> 01:09.369
<i>Most parents believe their children are the most
beautiful creatures ever to grace the planet.</i>

01:09.695 --> 01:11.572
<i>Others take
a less emotional approach.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:13.661
- What a waste of time.
- And painful.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.543
And expensive.
$9.25 for a bar of soap?

01:16.702 --> 01:19.797
Well, I had to take a shower, Harry.
$5000?

01:19.955 --> 01:23.004
I'm not paying it. What are they
gonna do, repossess the kid?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.193
There's no way out.
Make a U-turn.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.398
All right.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.486
- Harry!
- All right.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.033
Harry!

01:53.238 --> 01:54.581
The Wormwood guy's back!

01:54.740 --> 01:56.413
<i>Harry and Zinnia Wormwood</i>

01:56.575 --> 01:59.499
<i>lived in a very nice neighborhood,
in a very nice house.</i>

01:59.661 --> 02:02.460
<i>But they were not really
very nice people.</i>

02:12.758 --> 02:15.261
Get out of the street, you little dodos!

02:21.808 --> 02:25.028
<i>The Wormwoods were so
wrapped up in their own silly lives</i>

02:25.187 --> 02:27.440
<i>that they barely noticed
they had a daughter.</i>

02:27.606 --> 02:29.825
<i>Had they paid any attention
to her at all,</i>

02:29.983 --> 02:33.328
<i>they'd have realized
she was a rather extraordinary child.</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:36.115
Oh, my gosh, Matilda,
now look what you did!

02:36.281 --> 02:38.409
<i>They named her Matilda.</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:41.920
You're supposed
to eat the spinach. Ooh!

02:42.287 --> 02:46.713
Ew, ew, ew.
Ew, ew, ew!

02:51.046 --> 02:52.593
Babies!

02:52.756 --> 02:55.635
You're better off raising tomatoes.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.891
<i>By the time she was 2,</i>

02:58.053 --> 03:01.398
<i>Matilda had learned what most
people learn in their early 30s:</i>

03:01.556 --> 03:03.729
<i>How to take care of herself.</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:11.279
<i>As time went by,
she developed a sense of style.</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:14.903
<i>Every morning, Matilda's brother,
Michael, went to school.</i>

03:15.112 --> 03:16.284
Bye, Mom.
Get out of here.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.416
<i>Her father worked selling used cars
Make money.</i>

03:19.574 --> 03:22.669
<i>for unfair prices.
And her mother took off to play bingo.</i>

03:22.828 --> 03:25.923
Soup's on the stove.
Heat it up if you get hungry.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.296
<i>Matilda was left alone.</i>

03:29.668 --> 03:31.215
<i>That was how she liked it.</i>

03:36.717 --> 03:39.641
<i>♪ On my way, on my way ♪</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:44.061
<i>♪ On my way, on my way ♪</i>

03:44.683 --> 03:48.358
<i>♪ I would like to reach out my hand ♪</i>

03:49.104 --> 03:53.484
<i>♪ I may see you
I may tell you to run ♪</i>

03:53.650 --> 03:55.948
<i>♪ On my way, on my way ♪</i>

03:56.111 --> 03:57.784
<i>♪ You know what they say
About the young ♪</i>

04:00.699 --> 04:05.671
<i>♪ Well, pick me up with golden hand ♪</i>

04:05.871 --> 04:06.963
<i>♪ I may see you ♪</i>

04:07.122 --> 04:11.377
<i>By the time she was 4, Matilda
had read every magazine in the house.</i>

04:11.918 --> 04:13.841
<i>One night,
she got up her courage</i>

04:14.004 --> 04:17.725
<i>and asked her father for something
she desperately wanted.</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:20.682
A book?
What do you want a book for?

04:20.886 --> 04:22.183
To read.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.599
To read? Why would you wanna read
when you got the television set

04:25.766 --> 04:27.860
sitting right in front of you?

04:28.685 --> 04:33.031
There's nothing you can get from a book that
you can't get from a television faster.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.942
Get out of the way!

04:36.151 --> 04:39.030
<i>Matilda already knew that she
was somewhat different from her family.</i>

04:40.363 --> 04:42.786
<i>She saw that whatever
she needed in this world,</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:44.951
<i>she'd have to get herself.</i>

04:45.410 --> 04:47.128
<i>Bye.
Ciao.</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:50.166
There's fish fingers
in the microwave.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.092
<i>The next morning,
after her parents left,</i>

04:56.254 --> 04:58.677
<i>Matilda set off
in search of a book.</i>

05:37.587 --> 05:40.215
Where are the
children's books, please?

05:40.382 --> 05:42.100
In that room right over there.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.388
Would you like me to pick you out
one with lots of pictures in it?

05:46.096 --> 05:49.350
No, thank you.
I'm sure I can manage.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.036
<i>From then on, every day,
as soon as her mother went to bingo,</i>

06:09.327 --> 06:12.922
<i>Matilda walked
the 10 blocks to the library</i>

06:14.040 --> 06:16.919
<i>and devoured
one book after another.</i>

06:21.089 --> 06:23.433
<i>When she finished
all the children's books,</i>

06:23.592 --> 06:26.641
<i>she started wandering around
in search of something else.</i>

06:26.803 --> 06:29.727
<i>Mrs. Phelps, who had been
watching her with fascination</i>

06:29.890 --> 06:31.358
<i>for the past few weeks,</i>

06:31.516 --> 06:34.520
<i>offered Matilda some valuable
library information.</i>

06:34.686 --> 06:37.530
You know, you could have
your very own library card.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.067
And then you could
take books home

06:40.233 --> 06:43.237
and you wouldn't have
to walk here every day.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.576
You could take
as many as you like.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.117
That would be wonderful.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.255
<i>So Matilda's strong,
young mind continued to grow,</i>

06:54.414 --> 06:57.167
<i>nurtured by the voices
of all those authors</i>

06:57.334 --> 06:59.837
<i>who had sent their books
out into the world</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:02.973
<i>like ships onto the sea.</i>

07:10.931 --> 07:15.402
<i>These books gave Matilda
a hopeful and comforting message:</i>

07:15.685 --> 07:17.687
<i>You are not alone.</i>

07:38.041 --> 07:39.543
Any packages come today?

07:39.751 --> 07:41.128
Mm-mm.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.721
Where did
all this come from?

07:44.214 --> 07:45.887
The library.

07:46.049 --> 07:50.225
The library? You've never set foot in a library.
You're only 4 years old.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.764
Six and a half.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.557
You're 4.
Six and a half.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.067
If you were 6 and a half,
you'd be in school already.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.069
I want to be in school.
I told you

07:58.228 --> 08:01.698
I was supposed to start school
in September. You wouldn't listen.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.576
Get up. Get UP!

08:05.318 --> 08:08.037
Get out here.
Give me that book.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.748
Dearest pie, how old is Matilda?
Four

08:13.910 --> 08:16.834
I'm 6 and a half, Mommy.
Five, then.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.416
I was 6 in August.
You're a liar.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.920
I wanna go to school.
School!

08:23.086 --> 08:26.340
Out of the question. Who would be
here to sign for the packages?

08:26.506 --> 08:29.601
We can't leave valuable packages
sitting out on the doorstep.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.437
Now, go watch TV
like a good kid.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.974
You know, sometimes I think there's
something wrong with that girl.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.690
Hm. Tell me about it.
Mm.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.695
Hey, dip-face,

08:40.854 --> 08:44.279
have a marshmallow.
Have another marshmallow, dip-face!

08:45.150 --> 08:46.743
Dip-face!

08:54.617 --> 08:57.291
<i>Sometimes Matilda
longed for a friend.</i>

08:57.454 --> 09:01.084
<i>Someone like the kind,
courageous people in her books.</i>

09:01.249 --> 09:04.628
<i>It occurred to her that
like talking dragons and princesses</i>

09:04.794 --> 09:10.426
<i>with hair long enough to climb, such
people might exist only in storybooks.</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:14.354
<i>But Matilda was about to discover
that she could be her own friend.</i>

09:14.512 --> 09:17.391
<i>That she had a kind of strength
she wasn't even aware of.</i>

09:17.932 --> 09:20.526
I'm great! I'm incredible!

09:20.685 --> 09:23.154
Michael, pencil and paper,
in the kitchen.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.907
Did we sell some cars today,
honeydew?

09:26.066 --> 09:27.363
Did we!

09:27.525 --> 09:29.448
Does that mean
I can get that new TV?

09:29.611 --> 09:32.785
Yeah. Son, one day you're gonna
have to earn your own living.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.041
It's time you learned
the family business.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.623
Sit down. Write this down.

09:38.244 --> 09:43.125
All right. The first car your
brilliant father sold cost $320.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.966
I sold it for $1158.

09:47.128 --> 09:49.677
The second one cost $512.
Mm-hm.

09:49.839 --> 09:55.016
I sold it for $2269.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.522
Wait, Dad, you're going too fast.
Just write.

09:57.680 --> 10:03.028
The third cost $68.
I sold it for $999.

10:03.186 --> 10:07.191
And the fourth cost $1100.

10:07.357 --> 10:13.285
I sold it for 7839
big American boffos.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.949
Harry!
What was my profit for the day?

10:16.116 --> 10:20.337
Could you repeat the last one--?
$10,265.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.383
Check it if you don't believe me.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.844
You're a little cheat.
You saw the paper.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.679
From all the way over here?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.141
Are you being smart with me?

10:38.805 --> 10:41.433
If you're being smart with me, young
lady, you're gonna be punished.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.897
Punished for being smart?

10:44.060 --> 10:46.028
For being a smart aleck.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.991
When a person is bad, that person
has to be taught a lesson.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.073
Person?
Get up!

10:52.569 --> 10:54.537
- Get up.
- Harry Wormwood

10:54.696 --> 10:56.949
<i>had unintentionally
given his daughter</i>

10:57.115 --> 10:59.868
<i>the first practical advice
she could use.</i>

11:00.034 --> 11:02.662
<i>He meant to say,
"When a child is bad."</i>

11:02.829 --> 11:05.457
<i>Instead he said,
"When a person is bad."</i>

11:05.623 --> 11:09.127
<i>And thereby introduced
a revolutionary idea</i>

11:09.294 --> 11:12.468
<i>that children could
punish their parents.</i>

11:14.299 --> 11:16.677
<i>Only when they deserved it,
of course.</i>

12:36.089 --> 12:38.467
Michael, come into my room.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.637
What?

12:42.804 --> 12:46.684
My boy, today's the day I take you to the shop.
What do you say?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.068
I don't know.
What do you say, Dad?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.696
I say appearance
is nine-tenths of the law.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.902
People don't buy a car,
they buy me.

12:54.065 --> 12:57.035
Which is why I personally
take such pride in my appearance.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.663
Well-oiled hair,
clean shaved, snappy suit.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.951
Now, run along and get ready
for a big day of learning, kid. Heh.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.245
It's gonna be a big day
of learning too.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.881
There's a sucker born every minute.
We're gonna take them for all they got.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.216
Give me the cookies.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.172
Here.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.887
Okay, my boy, heir to the throne.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.726
Today we diddle the customer.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.896
What's wrong with you?
What are you looking at?

13:29.392 --> 13:31.690
Lovekins, where's my breakfast?

13:31.853 --> 13:35.153
Here we are, my heartstrings. Aah!

13:36.607 --> 13:39.577
Snickerdoodle, what did
you do to your hair?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.366
My hair?

13:56.002 --> 13:58.755
Give me those things. Give me that.
Where are you going with those?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.265
Give me those.
Get in the car. Go on.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.479
<i>- Get in.
- Dirty dealings,</i>

14:07.972 --> 14:11.351
<i>Like buying stolen car parts,
never stay secret for long.</i>

14:11.517 --> 14:14.612
<i>Especially when the FBI
gets involved.</i>

14:20.860 --> 14:24.410
9:17, suspect exits domicile.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.449
I've got 9:18.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.294
9:17 is correct.

14:40.755 --> 14:44.635
Michael, one day
all this will be yours.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.511
This?

14:46.677 --> 14:49.806
See this junker?
I paid $100 for it.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.100
She's got 120,000 miles on her.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.190
Transmission shot,
bumpers have fallen off.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.276
What do I do with her? Hm?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.575
I sell her.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.202
We really should weld
these bumpers on,

15:03.361 --> 15:07.161
but that takes time,
equipment, money.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.827
So we use
Super Super Glue instead.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.371
Go ahead, put it on there.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.123
Won't it fall off?

15:15.289 --> 15:18.338
Definitely.
Isn't that dangerous?

15:18.501 --> 15:20.629
Not to me, okay?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.297
Transmission.

15:22.463 --> 15:26.684
The sawdust quiets the gears, and
lets the engine run as sweet as a nut

15:26.843 --> 15:29.346
for a couple of miles. Ha-ha-ha.
Daddy, that's cheating.

15:29.512 --> 15:33.016
Of course it's cheating.
Nobody ever got rich being honest.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.186
20 years ago, we could turn
the numbers back by hand. But--

15:36.352 --> 15:38.354
Here, take my hat.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.909
But the feds like to test the ingenuity
of the American businessman.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.656
Two-directional drill.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.288
You run it backwards,
the numbers go down.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.666
Watch the speedometer.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.372
Cool.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.626
See?
Yeah.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.836
Daddy, you're a crook.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.131
What?
This is illegal.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.341
Here, keep drilling.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.930
Do you make money?
Do you have a job?

16:08.092 --> 16:10.470
No, but don't people
need good cars?

16:10.636 --> 16:13.310
Can't you sell good cars, Dad?

16:14.056 --> 16:16.024
Listen, you little wiseacre.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.814
I'm smart, you're dumb. I'm big, you're little.
I'm right, you're wrong.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.232
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.998
Harry, I won! I won!

16:38.164 --> 16:41.759
I hit the double bingo! Aah!

16:41.918 --> 16:45.343
Come on, everybody!
I'm taking you all to Café Le Ritz.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.382
Let me see the money.
Never mind.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.346
Double bingo, huh? Ooh.

16:49.634 --> 16:53.013
God, your hair looks awful.
I hope they let you in.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.181
- They'll let me in.
- Here's your hat, Daddy.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.225
Get in the car.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.944
Go on, get in.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.193
How much?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.279
It's for me to know
and you to find out.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.074
It's nice to go out sometimes.
Yeah.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.288
You never take us out.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.202
Of course I do.
I took you to the Flipper.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.713
- I don't remember any of the Flipper.
- The fish joint.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.964
You found that comb
in the bouillabaisse.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.125
Oh, yeah. I like that joint.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.594
Bonjour.
This way, please.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.255
Harry, take your hat off.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.849
I can't.
This is a nice place.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.850
You can't wear a hat inside.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.135
I can't take it off.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.146
Harry, nobody cares
what your hair looks like.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.525
What's with this hat?
I can't get it off. I can't get it off.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.272
Just a minute. I'm gonna yank
this hat off. I'm pulling it.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.118
I think your head
swelled up really bad.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.540
You're pulling the skin!
You're such a baby! Stop it!

17:54.699 --> 17:57.168
Fibers are fused to the head!
Fibers are fused?

17:57.326 --> 18:00.250
What is that supposed to mean?
Give me that hat!

18:29.692 --> 18:31.945
Mm.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.865
I will not be the figure of ridicule!

18:36.032 --> 18:38.251
I want respect, and I want it now!

18:40.202 --> 18:42.955
I still don't see how you
glued your hat on, Harry.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.716
I mean, I know you say you didn't,
but obviously you did.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.344
I did not glue my hat to my head.

18:48.502 --> 18:52.678
The hat shrunk,
the fibers fused to my hair. Ow.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.260
Baby, wait a minute.
I'm getting it now.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.224
I'm getting it. One more.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.352
Oh, my God.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.820
From now on, this family
does exactly what I say,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.409
when, exactly when, I say it!

19:16.572 --> 19:19.075
Here's your hat, Harry.
Give me that.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.168
And right now,

19:21.494 --> 19:24.714
we are eating dinner
and watching TV.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.587
<i>Are you ready to get
sticky with Mickey?</i>

19:32.004 --> 19:33.597
Shut your light off.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.768
<i>I'm just giving it away!</i>

19:36.926 --> 19:40.931
<i>But for those idiots out there who don't
know how to play, here's how it goes.</i>

19:41.097 --> 19:45.443
<i>For each correct answer, they'll move
one step closer to our cube of cash.</i>

19:45.601 --> 19:49.526
<i>Once in our cube of cash, any money
that sticks to your gooey body,</i>

19:49.689 --> 19:51.862
<i>you get to take home.</i>

19:54.819 --> 19:56.662
Hi, Dad.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.243
Are you in this family?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.292
Mm...

20:01.450 --> 20:03.293
Hello?

20:03.452 --> 20:06.046
Are you in this family?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.341
Dinnertime is family time.
What is this trash you're reading?

20:12.628 --> 20:14.801
It's not trash, Daddy, it's lovely.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.217
It's called <i>Moby Dick,</i>
by Herman Melville.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.556
Moby what?

20:20.720 --> 20:26.022
This is filth! Trash! Here.
It's not mine! It's a library book.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.730
Trash!

20:27.893 --> 20:32.114
I'm fed up with all this reading! You're
a Wormwood, you start acting like one!

20:32.273 --> 20:33.616
Sit up and look at the TV.

20:33.774 --> 20:37.495
<i>Producers are not liable for any skin
irritation that may result from playing our game.</i>

20:37.653 --> 20:39.781
<i>Get real sticky and get
cash for free.</i>

20:39.947 --> 20:43.247
<i>All right, that's enough.
Let's get sticky!</i>

21:20.905 --> 21:22.657
I didn't do it.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.667
Of course you didn't do it,
you little twit.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.333
I told you that was
a cheap set.

21:28.496 --> 21:32.217
It's not a cheap set,
it's a stolen set.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.092
Put your light on!

21:36.045 --> 21:37.092
Bummer.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.222
<i>Was it magic or coincidence?</i>

21:39.381 --> 21:40.883
<i>She didn't know.</i>

21:41.050 --> 21:44.771
<i>It is said that we humans use
only a tiny portion of our brains.</i>

21:44.929 --> 21:48.433
<i>Matilda might never have discovered
her own great strength of mind</i>

21:48.599 --> 21:52.274
<i>were it not for the events
that began on the very next day.</i>

21:52.436 --> 21:54.859
I need a car,
inexpensive but reliable.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.696
- Can you service me?
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.280
Welcome to Wormwood Motors.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.696
Harry Wormwood,
owner, founder, whatever.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.787
Agatha Trunchbull, principal,
Crunchem Hall Elementary School.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.746
I warn you, sir, I want a tight
car, because I run a tight ship.

22:09.912 --> 22:13.837
Oh, yeah, huh? Well, uh--
My school is a model of discipline.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.094
“Use the rod, beat the child,"
that's my motto.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.597
Terrific motto.
You have brats yourself?

22:19.755 --> 22:22.178
Yeah, I got a boy, Mikey,
and one mistake, Matilda.

22:22.341 --> 22:26.471
They're all mistakes, children. Filthy,
nasty things. Glad I never was one.

22:26.637 --> 22:30.062
Uh-huh. Well, since you're an educator,
I'm gonna make you a great deal.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.852
You had better.
Let's do business.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.189
Thank you.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.948
Enjoy it.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.197
Hey, you, you're going to school.
I am?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.203
First thing tomorrow.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.409
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. You'll get
a real education at this place.

22:49.869 --> 22:54.045
<i>Matilda had always wanted to
go to school because she loved to learn.</i>

22:54.582 --> 22:57.836
<i>She tried to imagine
what her new school would be like.</i>

22:58.002 --> 22:59.094
Go ahead.

22:59.086 --> 22:59.803
Go ahead.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.136
<i>She pictured a lovely
building surrounded by trees</i>

23:03.299 --> 23:05.677
<i>and flowers and swings.</i>

23:07.928 --> 23:09.930
<i>Well, there was a building</i>

23:10.139 --> 23:11.812
<i>and children.</i>

23:11.974 --> 23:14.602
<i>So regardless of what
Crunchem Hall looked like,</i>

23:14.768 --> 23:16.486
<i>she was happy to be there.</i>

23:16.645 --> 23:17.988
Hey, wait up!

23:18.439 --> 23:22.489
<i>After all, any school
is better than no school at all.</i>

23:23.360 --> 23:24.657
<i>Isn't it?</i>

23:58.896 --> 24:00.273
You, detention.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.706
You're too small.
Grow up quicker!

24:12.034 --> 24:13.911
Heads up! Shoulders back!
Stomachs in! Stand straight.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.295
Hey-
sorry-

24:15.454 --> 24:16.501
Detention for you.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.713
That's okay. It's much better
than being out there.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.172
Is that my teacher?

24:21.335 --> 24:23.758
No, that's the principal,
Miss Trunchbull.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.889
You've gotta be kidding.
Uh-uh.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.684
You squirts better skedaddle.
I'm not kidding.

24:28.842 --> 24:31.721
The Trunchbull likes to snap a whip
in there to see who's trying to hide.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.434
Stomach in!

24:34.139 --> 24:35.766
Change those socks! Too pink.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.526
I'm Matilda.
Lavender.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.861
- I'm Hortensia.
- Hi.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.900
She doesn't really hit children
with that riding crop, does she?

24:44.066 --> 24:46.194
No, it's mostly for scare.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.078
What she does is worse.

24:48.237 --> 24:52.037
Like yesterday, in the second grade,
the Trunchbull makes a weekly visit

24:52.199 --> 24:56.500
to every classroom to show the teachers
a thing or two about handling kids.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.084
And Julius Rottwinkle ate

24:58.247 --> 25:01.126
<i>- two M&M's during her lesson.
- And she caught him?</i>

25:01.291 --> 25:02.918
<i>Of course.</i>

25:08.841 --> 25:12.141
Was Julius okay?
After being thrown out the window?

25:12.302 --> 25:15.727
Of course he wasn't okay.
He lived, if that's what you mean.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.733
The Trunchbull used
to be in the Olympics.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.112
Shot put, javelin, hammer throw.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.443
The hammer throw is her specialty.

25:23.605 --> 25:27.109
So she does this all the time?
Better than being put in the choky.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.029
- Choky?
- Yeah, the choky.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.039
It's a tall, narrow hole
in the wall behind a door.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.042
<i>You have to stand
in a drippy pipe with jagged edges.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:38.750
<i>And the walls have broken glass
and nails sticking out.</i>

25:38.912 --> 25:41.791
Get inside, you
festering ball of pus!

25:41.957 --> 25:44.460
<i>- She puts kids in there?
- I've been in twice.</i>

25:44.626 --> 25:46.845
<i>Sometimes she leaves you
in there all day.</i>

25:47.004 --> 25:49.803
- Didn't you tell your parents?
- They didn't believe me.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.351
I mean, would your parents
believe it?

25:52.509 --> 25:55.308
“I must obey Miss Trunchbull."

25:55.888 --> 25:57.435
No.

25:57.598 --> 25:59.817
Out of my way.
Here she comes.

26:01.643 --> 26:05.819
Ahh, fresh meat.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.616
Amanda Thripp.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.330
Yes, Miss Trunchbull.

26:17.618 --> 26:20.337
What are those?
What's what, Miss Trunchbull?

26:20.579 --> 26:23.332
Hanging down by your ears.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.001
You mean my pigtails?

26:26.543 --> 26:30.343
Are you a pig, Amanda?
No, Miss Trunchbull.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.517
Do I allow pigs in my school?

26:33.675 --> 26:36.929
My mommy thinks they're sweet.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.856
Your mommy is a twit!

26:41.350 --> 26:44.479
You'll chop those off
before school tomorrow or I will--

26:44.853 --> 26:46.230
But--
But?!

26:46.396 --> 26:49.115
I don't--
But? Did you say "but"?

26:49.691 --> 26:51.034
What? Hammer throw.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.828
Definitely.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.034
I'll give you "but"!

27:04.957 --> 27:08.302
- Good loft!
- And excellent release.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.058
Think she'll make the fence?
Gonna be a close one.

27:36.446 --> 27:39.575
Quiet! Get to class
before I throw you all in the choky.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.960
Lavender.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.712
What's my teacher like?

27:44.163 --> 27:47.918
Run, run, run. Faster! Get in.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.589
Quickly!

27:49.751 --> 27:51.719
<i>But Matilda's teacher, Miss Honey,</i>

27:51.879 --> 27:53.881
<i>was one of those
remarkable people</i>

27:54.047 --> 27:57.927
<i>who appreciates every single child
for who she or he is.</i>

27:58.093 --> 28:00.095
I scooped these up for you,
Miss Honey.

28:00.262 --> 28:03.607
Oh, how lovely.
Thank you, Amanda.

28:03.891 --> 28:07.816
Okay, listen up, everybody.
We have a new student with us today.

28:07.978 --> 28:11.528
This is Matilda Wormwood. I'd like
you to sit over here with Lavender.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.489
Now, you all remember how scary
your first days at school were.

28:14.651 --> 28:19.157
So I'd like you to be especially nice to
Matilda and make her feel welcome, all right?

28:19.323 --> 28:20.745
Could you get her
workbook for her, please?

28:20.908 --> 28:23.661
Yes, Miss Honey.
You can sit down.

28:24.328 --> 28:27.798
<i>Miss Honey was a wonderful
teacher and a friend to everyone.</i>

28:27.956 --> 28:31.301
<i>But her life was not as simple
and beautiful as it seemed.</i>

28:31.460 --> 28:34.304
<i>Miss Honey had a deep,
dark secret.</i>

28:34.463 --> 28:36.306
<i>Though it caused her great pain,</i>

28:36.465 --> 28:39.560
<i>she did not let it interfere
with her teaching.</i>

28:40.427 --> 28:43.476
Well, Matilda, you've come
on a very good day,

28:43.639 --> 28:47.143
because we're going to review
everything that we've learned so far.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.487
Now, it's all right if you don't understand
any of this because you're brand-new.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.820
But if you do know an answer,
just raise your hand. Okay?

28:54.191 --> 28:57.161
All right. We've been working
on our two-times tables.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.413
Would anyone like
to demonstrate?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.078
Okay.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.335
Let's do some together.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.672
- Two times four is?
- Eight.

29:09.831 --> 29:13.131
- Two times six is?
- Twelve.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.800
- Two times nine is?
- Eighteen.

29:15.963 --> 29:18.182
Excellent! You've been practicing.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.684
Pretty soon you'll be able to do
any multiplication,

29:20.842 --> 29:23.436
- whether it's two times seven...
- Fourteen.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.190
Very good. Or 13 times 379.

29:27.349 --> 29:31.024
4927.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.356
I beg your pardon?

29:34.523 --> 29:36.867
I think that's the answer.

29:37.025 --> 29:40.370
13 times 379.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.031
4-9-2-7.

30:00.549 --> 30:02.222
it is.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.724
Wow.

30:08.348 --> 30:11.067
Matilda, you know how
to multiply big numbers?

30:11.685 --> 30:15.690
I read this book last year
on mathematics at the library.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.656
You like to read?

30:19.818 --> 30:22.071
Oh, yes, I love to read.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.830
What do you like to read?

30:25.699 --> 30:29.829
Everything, but lately I've
been reading Darles Chickens.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.879
Charles Dickens.
I could read him every day.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.094
So could I.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.474
All right, everyone,

30:42.632 --> 30:46.136
take out your workbooks
and let's start with section three.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.775
I'll be back in a moment.

31:08.325 --> 31:13.297
Yippee! Gotcha right in the neck!
And you. Woo-hoo!

31:13.455 --> 31:16.299
Yes! You-- Come in, come in,
whoever you are.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.472
Almost got you.

31:23.090 --> 31:27.140
Good to see you, Jen.
Good, good, good.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.476
Time for one of our
little heart-to-hearts?

31:33.892 --> 31:37.362
Actually, it's about the new girl
in my class, Miss Trunchbull,

31:37.521 --> 31:39.148
Matilda Wormwood.

31:39.314 --> 31:42.158
Her father says she's a real wart.
A what?

31:42.317 --> 31:45.787
A carbuncle, a blister, a festering
pustule of malignant ooze.

31:45.946 --> 31:51.043
Oh, no, Matilda Wormwood
is a very sweet girl, and very bright.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.794
A bright child?

31:52.953 --> 31:55.251
Yes. She can multiply
large sums in her head.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.003
So can a calculator.

31:58.166 --> 32:03.764
Well, I think she might be happier
in an older and more advanced class.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.095
Ah, I knew it!

32:06.258 --> 32:09.933
You can't handle the little viper, so you're trying
to foist her off on one of the other teachers.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.847
No, no, no, Miss Trunchbull.
Yes!

32:12.013 --> 32:14.687
Typical, slothful cowardice.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.194
Listen to me, Jen.

32:17.352 --> 32:21.983
The distance the shot put goes depends
upon the effort you put into it.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.651
Perspiration!

32:23.817 --> 32:28.163
If you can't handle the little brat,
I'll lock her in the choky!

32:30.740 --> 32:32.959
Get it?
Yes, ma'am.

32:33.118 --> 32:37.715
One day, Jen, you'll see that
everything I do is for your own good,

32:37.873 --> 32:42.219
and the good of those
putrescent little children!

33:03.857 --> 33:06.235
Get back at Tiffany. Before.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.403
When she was having that--
Mom, I'm home.

33:08.570 --> 33:11.619
How was school?
School was great.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.409
My teacher lets me do
sixth-grade work. Look.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.920
Algebra and geography.
Hold on a minute.

33:17.078 --> 33:19.797
Can't you see I'm in the middle
of an important phone call?

33:20.123 --> 33:22.376
Well, you just asked me
how school was.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.010
Quiet.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.592
What else was she supposed
to do? The baby wasn't his.

33:26.755 --> 33:29.099
Well, it was really great.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.806
No way. They gotta be implants.

33:31.968 --> 33:36.815
The principal is insane. She threw
a girl over the fence by her hair.

33:36.973 --> 33:40.853
It would change your life too if
you waxed yours, I'm positive.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.023
I have the most
wonderful teacher.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.115
Mine are driving me crazy.

33:46.274 --> 33:49.619
I'm telling you, six hours a day
at school is not enough.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.200
I'll say.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.913
Hiyah. Whack to the belly! A smack to the face.
Another smack to the face!

33:55.075 --> 33:56.827
Burns is hurt. He's on the
ropes, ladies and gentlemen.

33:58.203 --> 34:00.171
Saved by the bell.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.837
Packages at this hour?
Come here.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.548
What?
Okay.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.136
Hello.

34:10.297 --> 34:14.223
We don't give money. We don't like charities.
We don't buy raffle tickets.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.309
Mr. Wormwood.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.643
I'm Jennifer Honey.
I'm Matilda's teacher.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.434
What has she done now?

34:20.600 --> 34:24.980
You! Go to your room
right now! Right now. Beat it!

34:25.438 --> 34:28.737
Look, whatever it is,
she's your problem now.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.822
No, there is no problem.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.405
Then beat it. We're watching TV.

34:34.989 --> 34:38.960
Mr. Wormwood, if you think
watching some rotten TV show

34:39.119 --> 34:42.464
is more important than your daughter,
then maybe you shouldn't be a parent.

34:42.621 --> 34:46.047
Now, why don't you turn that
darn thing off and listen to me?

34:50.213 --> 34:52.306
All right, come in.
Get this over with.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.685
Mrs. Wormwood's not gonna
like this. Come on, get in.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.685
Close the door.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.850
Who is it?
Some teacher.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.861
Says she's gotta talk
to you about Matilda.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.321
What did you do that for?
He had Velasquez on the ropes.

35:09.733 --> 35:10.780
What do you want?

35:10.942 --> 35:14.412
I'm sure you're aware by now that
Matilda has a brilliant mind.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.448
Yeah, right.
Mikey, get me a beer.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.243
Her math skills
are simply extraordinary.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.503
She's reading material that I--
Want one?

35:21.661 --> 35:24.039
Oh, no, thank you, dear.

35:24.205 --> 35:28.506
Material that I didn't see
until my second year of college.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.716
Oh, college.
Great, college.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.098
I really feel,
with private instruction

35:33.256 --> 35:36.055
that she'd be ready for college
in just a few short years.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.720
Look, Miss Snit.

35:38.887 --> 35:42.266
A girl does not get anywhere
by acting intelligent.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.400
I mean, take a look
at you and me.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.938
You chose books.
I chose looks.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.734
I have a nice house,
a wonderful husband,

35:51.900 --> 35:56.781
and you are slaving away teaching
snot-nosed children their ABC's.

35:56.946 --> 36:00.667
You want Matilda to go to college?
Ha-ha-ha.

36:00.867 --> 36:05.088
College! I didn't go to college.
I don't know anybody who did.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.796
Bunch of hippies and cesspool salesmen.
Ha-ha-ha.

36:08.958 --> 36:12.132
Don't sneer at educated people,
Mr. Wormwood.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.673
If you became ill,
heaven forbid,

36:14.839 --> 36:18.013
your doctor would be
a college graduate.

36:18.218 --> 36:21.142
Or say you were sued
for selling a faulty car.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.602
The lawyer who defended you
would've gone to college too.

36:23.765 --> 36:27.110
What car? Sued by who?

36:27.268 --> 36:30.397
Who you been talking to?
Nobody.

36:33.191 --> 36:38.914
Oh, dear, I can see
we're not going to agree, are we?

36:39.489 --> 36:42.743
No. I'm sorry I burst in
on you like this.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.627
Sorry.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.460
We ought to sue her
for interrupting our show.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.883
Tell me about it.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.090
Why's he in the middle of the ring?

36:53.253 --> 36:55.426
He's standing in the middle
of the ring because it's over.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.885
Thank you.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.721
We missed it?
Tomorrow.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.558
Great, it's over.
Who won?

37:02.721 --> 37:04.348
How do I know?
You shut it off!

37:04.514 --> 37:06.858
Was it my fault that she
came in the middle of the fight?

37:07.016 --> 37:08.563
<i>Hop to. Hippity-hop.</i>

37:08.727 --> 37:13.324
<i>The entire school will go
to the assembly room immediately.</i>

37:13.481 --> 37:15.108
Sit!

37:16.151 --> 37:18.904
What's up?
Beats me.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.496
Bruce Bogtrotter.

37:33.334 --> 37:36.713
Would little Brucey
come up here, please?

37:37.088 --> 37:39.432
Uh-Oh.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.686
He lives on my block.

37:56.357 --> 38:00.453
This boy,
Bruce Bogtrotter,

38:00.612 --> 38:04.537
is none other
than a vicious sneak thief.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.043
You're a disgusting
criminal, aren't you?

38:07.202 --> 38:09.625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.712
Cake. Chocolate cake.

38:13.082 --> 38:16.336
You slithered like a serpent
into the school kitchen

38:16.503 --> 38:18.881
and ate my personal snack!

38:19.506 --> 38:21.804
Do you deny it?

38:26.387 --> 38:29.231
Confess!

38:29.724 --> 38:32.978
Well, it's hard for me
to remember a specific cake.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.651
This one

38:35.814 --> 38:37.236
was mine.

38:37.398 --> 38:41.244
And it was the most scrumptious
cake in the entire world.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.528
My mom's is better.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.533
It is, is it?

38:46.741 --> 38:50.041
How can you be sure
unless you have another piece?

38:51.579 --> 38:54.549
Sit down, Bog.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.523
Here we go.

39:14.936 --> 39:18.156
Smells chocolaty, eh?

39:19.440 --> 39:22.284
Now, eat it!

39:24.904 --> 39:27.623
I don't want any, thank you.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.413
Eat it!

39:32.287 --> 39:34.085
Don't eat it.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.295
She wouldn't give him cake.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.630
It's poison.
Something's up.

39:45.216 --> 39:48.516
Mm. Mm-hm. Yeah.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.938
Mm.

39:59.439 --> 40:01.282
Mm.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.578
You look like you enjoyed that,
Brucey.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.663
Yes, ma'am.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.340
You must have some more.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.922
Oh, no, thanks.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.428
But you'll hurt Cook's feelings.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.681
Huh?
Cookie.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.681
She made this cake just for you
to have on your very own.

40:35.266 --> 40:39.021
Her sweat and blood
went into this cake

40:39.187 --> 40:45.365
and you will not leave this platform until
you have consumed the entire confection!

40:45.526 --> 40:47.699
Entire confection.

40:48.071 --> 40:50.369
See you at lunch.
Thank you, Cookie.

40:50.531 --> 40:54.286
Rotten kids.
You wanted cake, you got cake.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.875
Now, eat it!

41:10.593 --> 41:12.721
Poor Brucey.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.718
He's going to puke.

41:48.589 --> 41:51.342
I can't look.
Is he going to puke?

41:51.509 --> 41:53.432
Without a doubt.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.775
Bruce looks real bad.

42:02.937 --> 42:05.110
Give up? Ha-ha-ha.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.033
You can do it, Brucey!

42:12.447 --> 42:14.700
You can do it, Bruce!

42:15.533 --> 42:16.910
Yeah, you can do it!

42:18.286 --> 42:20.630
Go, Bruce!

42:21.080 --> 42:22.957
<i>Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!</i>

42:27.587 --> 42:28.634
Silence!

42:32.133 --> 42:33.726
Yes!

42:33.968 --> 42:36.096
Yeah!

42:37.764 --> 42:38.811
Silence!

42:42.894 --> 42:45.488
Stop! Silence!

43:08.836 --> 43:11.430
Shut up! The entire assembly

43:11.589 --> 43:15.469
will stay five hours after school
and copy from the dictionary.

43:15.968 --> 43:19.643
Any children who object
will go straight into the choky

43:19.806 --> 43:21.683
together!

43:27.188 --> 43:30.818
<i>Rescue 8 out of
Station 8, Los Angeles County.</i>

43:30.983 --> 43:35.079
<i>This was a Code R, an official way
of saying we've caught a bad one.</i>

43:35.238 --> 43:38.708
<i>The kind of accident where death
itself holds a stopwatch on us.</i>

43:41.244 --> 43:42.962
Young lady, where were you?

43:43.121 --> 43:46.375
Miss Trunchbull kept the whole school late
because this boy ate some chocolate cake.

43:46.541 --> 43:49.545
That's the biggest lie I ever heard.
You see those packages over there?

43:49.710 --> 43:52.964
They were left out for the world to see
because you weren't here to take them in.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.350
I don't think it's fair, bumpkins.
What?

43:55.508 --> 43:58.682
You get all this stuff from
catalogs, and I don't get anything.

43:58.845 --> 44:02.440
It's not catalogs, it's car parts, sweetness.
It's business.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.568
Oh, if it's business, why don't
you have it sent to the office?

44:05.726 --> 44:07.728
Because the cops may
be watching the office.

44:07.895 --> 44:10.148
The cops are watching
the house.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.409
What?
They're parked outside right now.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.908
You are such an ignoramus.

44:16.070 --> 44:20.075
Those are speedboat salesmen.
Really nice guys.

44:20.241 --> 44:21.914
Cops.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.503
Speedboats? There are
no lakes around here.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.135
Yeah, but some people like
to go away on the weekends.

44:31.294 --> 44:34.468
Some people have fun.
And some people are cops.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.598
They are not cops.
Are too.

44:36.757 --> 44:39.260
They are not. I ought to know
if there's cops watching my house.

44:39.427 --> 44:42.431
Now, go to bed,
you lying little earwig.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.813
<i>With the FBI watching her father</i>

44:45.975 --> 44:48.398
<i>and the Trunchbull
terrorising her school,</i>

44:48.561 --> 44:52.361
<i>it was a rare, happy moment when Matilda
could just play with her friends.</i>

44:52.523 --> 44:55.868
A frog! A frog! A frog!

44:56.736 --> 45:00.206
What is it, Lavender?
A frog!

45:02.158 --> 45:03.375
It's a salamander.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.457
- It's a chameleon.
- It's a newt.

45:05.620 --> 45:10.091
“Any of the small semiaquatic
salamanders from the genus Triturus."

45:10.249 --> 45:14.880
“Some are brightly colored and
secrete irritating substances."

45:18.299 --> 45:20.597
How could you keep going...?

45:20.760 --> 45:24.310
Useless, flaming car!

45:25.139 --> 45:26.561
Wormwood!

45:26.807 --> 45:28.400
Sell me a lemon?

45:28.559 --> 45:30.561
You're heading for
the choky, young lady!

45:30.728 --> 45:31.820
Choky?
Teach you a lesson.

45:31.979 --> 45:33.105
What lesson?

45:33.272 --> 45:35.570
You and your father think
you can make a fool out of me!

45:35.733 --> 45:38.282
My father?
The guy with that stupid haircut!

45:38.611 --> 45:42.616
I'm nothing like my father.
You're the spitting image.

45:42.823 --> 45:45.872
The apple never rots far
from the tree.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.086
Miss Honey!

45:48.246 --> 45:50.374
Miss Trunchbull teaches
our class today, Lavender.

45:50.539 --> 45:52.041
Please get a water pitcher.
But Miss Honey--

45:52.208 --> 45:55.337
Shh, shh. Quickly. She'll be
here any second. Come on.

45:56.379 --> 46:00.179
Make sure the water's cold, Lavender.
Hurry. Vinnie, cover the fish.

46:00.841 --> 46:03.890
Put away the art projects.
Put away anything colorful.

46:04.053 --> 46:05.646
Oh, Charlie, won't you get
those crayons for me.

46:05.805 --> 46:09.480
<i>Most great ideas come from
hard work and careful planning.</i>

46:09.642 --> 46:13.363
<i>Of course, once in a while,
they just jump out at you.</i>

46:13.521 --> 46:16.149
Raina, cover the birds and beetles.
Hurry! Hurry!

46:16.315 --> 46:18.363
I hear her coming.
Okay, now,

46:18.526 --> 46:21.245
last time, some of you
forgot yourselves.

46:21.404 --> 46:25.204
Don't speak unless you're spoken to.
Don't laugh. Don't smile.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.494
Don't even breathe loudly.

46:27.743 --> 46:30.212
Don't breathe at all.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.049
Morning, Miss Trunchbull.

46:34.208 --> 46:36.427
Good morning, Miss Trunchbull.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.171
Sit!

46:43.718 --> 46:45.686
Shoo!

46:48.014 --> 46:52.520
I have never been able to understand
why small children are so disgusting.

46:52.685 --> 46:54.904
They're the bane of my life.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.485
They're like insects.
Where's <i>Matilda?</i>

46:57.648 --> 47:00.993
They should be got
rid of as early as possible.

47:01.277 --> 47:02.824
Fsht!

47:03.404 --> 47:05.577
My idea of a perfect school

47:05.740 --> 47:10.621
is one in which there
are no children at all.

47:11.746 --> 47:14.215
Do you agree, Miss Honey?

47:18.127 --> 47:19.219
Now,

47:19.879 --> 47:22.758
you, front of the class!

47:28.763 --> 47:30.936
Are you okay?

47:31.932 --> 47:36.028
Next time I tell you to empty
your pockets, you'll do it faster, won't you?

47:36.187 --> 47:38.610
- Yes, Miss Trunchbull.
- Miss Honey.

47:39.148 --> 47:43.119
This could be the most interesting
thing you've ever done.

47:46.447 --> 47:49.041
Sit down, you squirming
worm of vomit!

47:49.200 --> 47:51.578
Thank you, Miss Trunchbull.

48:01.087 --> 48:02.805
Get up!

48:05.299 --> 48:06.346
Can you spell?

48:06.592 --> 48:09.687
Miss Honey taught us how
to spell a long word yesterday.

48:09.845 --> 48:11.597
We can spell "difficulty."

48:11.764 --> 48:15.485
You couldn't spell "difficulty"
if your life depended on it.

48:15.935 --> 48:17.687
She taught us with a poem.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.526
A poem, how sweet.

48:19.688 --> 48:25.115
<i>What poem would that be?
Mrs. D, Mrs. I</i>

48:25.277 --> 48:27.746
Mrs. F-F-I

48:27.905 --> 48:32.411
<i>Mrs. C, Mrs. U
Mrs. L-T-Y</i>

48:33.327 --> 48:35.500
Why are
all these women married?

48:35.663 --> 48:40.009
Mrs. D? Mrs. I? You're supposed
to be teaching spelling, not poetry!

48:45.756 --> 48:50.387
I cannot, for the life of me, understand why
small children take so long to grow up.

48:50.553 --> 48:53.306
I think they do it deliberately
just to annoy me.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.446
Shh, shh, shh, Shh.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.953
What's funny? Hm?

49:12.199 --> 49:14.952
Come on, spit it out.
Speak up.

49:15.119 --> 49:18.043
I like a joke as well
as the next fat person.

49:23.586 --> 49:26.965
Ah! It's a snake. It's a snake!

49:27.965 --> 49:29.842
It's a snake! Uch!

49:31.844 --> 49:35.269
One of you tried
to poison me. Who?

49:36.557 --> 49:38.559
Matilda.

49:38.726 --> 49:39.773
I knew it!

49:40.019 --> 49:43.740
I just thought you'd like to know,
it's not a snake. It's a newt.

49:43.898 --> 49:46.868
What did you say?
It's a newt.

49:47.026 --> 49:52.248
Stand up, you villainous sack
of goat slime! You did this.

49:52.406 --> 49:53.532
No, Miss Trunchbull.

49:53.699 --> 49:58.205
Did you act alone,
or did you have accomplices?

49:58.370 --> 49:59.997
I didn't do it.

50:00.164 --> 50:02.587
You didn't like
the choky, did you?

50:02.750 --> 50:04.844
Thought you'd
pay me back, didn't you?

50:05.002 --> 50:08.131
Well, I'll pay you back,
young lady.

50:08.297 --> 50:11.346
For what, Miss Trunchbull?
For this newt, you piss-worm!

50:11.509 --> 50:14.433
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

50:15.095 --> 50:17.518
Besides, even if you didn't
do it, I'm gonna punish you

50:17.681 --> 50:21.436
because I'm big and you're small,
and I'm right and you're wrong.

50:21.602 --> 50:24.196
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

50:24.355 --> 50:28.280
You're a liar and a scoundrel,
and your father's a liar and a cheat.

50:28.442 --> 50:32.948
You're the most corrupt lowlifes
in the history of civilization.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.616
Am I wrong'? I'm never wrong.

50:36.242 --> 50:42.124
In this classroom,
in this school, I am God!

51:13.779 --> 51:15.497
You!
I didn't move.

51:16.156 --> 51:17.703
You did this!

51:17.866 --> 51:21.996
How could she possibly have done it
when she was sitting way over here?

51:23.080 --> 51:26.550
I'll be watching you,
each and every one.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.382
When you turn the corner,

51:28.544 --> 51:31.673
when you go to your cubbies
to get your smelly coats,

51:31.839 --> 51:33.841
when you skip merrily to lunch,

51:34.008 --> 51:36.852
I'll be watching you, all of you,

51:37.011 --> 51:39.560
and especially you.

51:48.814 --> 51:50.657
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

51:51.191 --> 51:54.866
Thanks for not telling.
Best friends don't tell.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.958
She can really dance.

52:00.534 --> 52:04.004
I'm gonna clean up this mess, and then I'll
come and help you fill the bird feeder, okay?

52:04.163 --> 52:06.382
I'll be out there in a minute.

52:08.751 --> 52:11.504
Miss Honey?
Yes, Matilda?

52:13.213 --> 52:15.966
Miss Honey, I did it.

52:16.508 --> 52:19.057
Did what?
I made the glass tip over.

52:19.219 --> 52:23.224
Oh, sweetheart, don't let Miss
Trunchbull make you feel that way.

52:23.390 --> 52:25.063
Nobody did it.
it was an accident.

52:25.225 --> 52:29.230
I did it with my eyes.
Watch, I'll prove it to you.

52:32.733 --> 52:35.031
It's wonderful you feel
so powerful.

52:35.819 --> 52:39.073
Many people don't feel
powerful at all.

52:48.415 --> 52:52.921
Come on, tip over, you glass.
Glass, tip over. Tip over.

52:53.087 --> 52:55.590
Come on, tip over.
Tip over, glass.

52:55.756 --> 52:57.429
It's all right, Matilda.

53:01.095 --> 53:04.349
I really did do it, Miss Honey.

53:04.515 --> 53:08.611
One of the odd things about life
is sometimes you can do something

53:08.769 --> 53:11.864
until you wanna show someone,
and then you can't.

53:12.022 --> 53:14.946
Or sometimes you think something's broken
and then you take it to be fixed--

53:15.109 --> 53:16.736
This isn't like that.

53:17.361 --> 53:18.453
Oh.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.411
I don't know.

53:22.282 --> 53:24.956
Maybe I made myself tired.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.210
Matilda, would you like to come
over to my house this afternoon?

53:30.124 --> 53:32.468
I'd like that very much,
Miss Honey.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.552
Good.

53:36.797 --> 53:39.801
I just stare very hard,
and then my eyes get all hot,

53:39.967 --> 53:42.311
and I can feel the strongness.

53:42.469 --> 53:46.474
I feel like I can move
almost anything in the world.

53:47.182 --> 53:49.355
You do believe me,
don't you?

53:49.518 --> 53:51.646
Oh, I believe that you should
believe in whatever power

53:51.812 --> 53:56.659
you think you have inside of you.
Believe it with all your heart.

53:59.528 --> 54:02.498
That's where
Miss Trunchbull lives.

54:04.533 --> 54:06.331
Why is there a swing?

54:07.661 --> 54:13.168
A girl I know used to live in that house.
Her life was good and happy.

54:13.333 --> 54:17.304
<i>When she was just 2 years old,
her mother died.</i>

54:17.463 --> 54:19.215
<i>Her father was a doctor,</i>

54:19.381 --> 54:22.180
<i>and he needed someone
to look after things at home,</i>

54:22.342 --> 54:25.721
<i>so he invited the mother's stepsister
to come and live with him.</i>

54:25.888 --> 54:30.268
<i>But the girl's aunt was a mean person
who treated the girl very badly.</i>

54:30.434 --> 54:33.608
<i>- The Trunchbull.
- Yes.</i>

54:33.771 --> 54:37.867
<i>And worst of all,
when the girl was 5, her father died.</i>

54:38.025 --> 54:39.493
<i>How did her father die?</i>

54:39.651 --> 54:42.495
<i>The police decided
he'd killed himself.</i>

54:42.654 --> 54:44.406
<i>Why would he do such a thing?</i>

54:44.573 --> 54:46.541
<i>No one knows.</i>

54:50.913 --> 54:52.711
The end is happier.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.546
She found a small cottage.

54:54.708 --> 54:58.588
She rented it from this lovely
rhubarb farmer for just $50 a month

54:58.754 --> 55:02.384
and she covered it in honeysuckle, and
she planted hundreds of wildflowers

55:02.549 --> 55:05.723
and she moved out of her wicked aunt's
house and she finally got her freedom.

55:05.886 --> 55:07.980
Good for her.

55:08.138 --> 55:11.233
Do you know why I told you this?
No.

55:13.894 --> 55:17.239
You were born into a family that
doesn't always appreciate you,

55:17.773 --> 55:21.243
but one day, things are
gonna be very different.

55:25.739 --> 55:28.709
Should we go inside
and have tea and cookies?

55:28.867 --> 55:30.619
Yes, please.
Okay.

55:35.290 --> 55:38.920
This is the cottage from your story.
Yes.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.386
The young woman is you.

55:43.799 --> 55:45.801
But then--

55:46.301 --> 55:49.475
No.
Yes.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.936
Aunt Trunchbull.

55:55.853 --> 55:58.322
When I left my home,
Aunt Trunchbull's home,

55:58.480 --> 56:00.608
I had to leave
all my treasures behind.

56:01.191 --> 56:05.617
Treasures?
Photographs of my mother and father,

56:05.821 --> 56:10.076
and a beautiful doll my mother
gave me with a china face.

56:10.242 --> 56:12.290
Lissy Doll, I called her.

56:12.452 --> 56:15.046
Would you like some milk?
Yes, please.

56:16.582 --> 56:19.176
Why don't you run away?

56:20.377 --> 56:24.507
I've often thought about it,
but I can't abandon my children.

56:24.673 --> 56:27.847
And if I couldn't teach,
I'd have nothing at all.

56:28.010 --> 56:30.809
You're very brave, Miss Honey.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.728
Not as brave as you.

56:33.891 --> 56:36.644
I thought grownups
weren't afraid of anything.

56:36.810 --> 56:38.153
Quite the contrary.

56:38.645 --> 56:41.774
All grownups get scared,
just like children.

56:42.649 --> 56:46.153
I wonder what
Miss Trunchbull is afraid of.

56:53.368 --> 56:55.666
There she is.

57:02.044 --> 57:03.921
Shot put.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.304
Hammer throw.

57:05.464 --> 57:07.558
Javelin.

57:18.852 --> 57:20.229
Back, back, back, back!

57:20.604 --> 57:22.356
She's afraid of a cat?

57:22.522 --> 57:24.775
Black cats.
She's very superstitious.

57:24.983 --> 57:26.155
Go!

57:27.945 --> 57:29.538
Go!

57:32.199 --> 57:33.542
Oh.

57:34.910 --> 57:36.036
Poor kitty.

57:36.370 --> 57:39.374
Oh, he's all right.
Hopefully.

57:46.254 --> 57:49.133
Let's go get your treasures.
No, Matilda.

57:49.299 --> 57:52.929
Well, she's gone. Come on.

57:55.555 --> 57:59.105
Matilda!
Miss Honey.

58:05.440 --> 58:09.240
Come on, move, you
piece of junkyard fodder.

58:09.403 --> 58:11.576
Shift, you-- No, no.

58:19.955 --> 58:22.504
My house.

58:30.966 --> 58:33.344
Oh, my.

58:36.096 --> 58:38.815
My father's portrait
used to hang there.

58:38.974 --> 58:42.524
Whoever painted the Trunchbull
must have had a strong stomach.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.272
A really strong stomach.

59:07.502 --> 59:08.879
We should go.

59:09.629 --> 59:12.599
Father's chocolate box.

59:16.678 --> 59:20.933
After supper, he'd take
a chocolate, cut it in half,

59:21.099 --> 59:23.522
and he'd always
give me the bigger half.

59:24.311 --> 59:27.736
When he died, Trunchbull would count
them so I couldn't even sneak one.

59:27.898 --> 59:32.495
She'd take a chocolate,
bring it to her lips and say:

59:32.652 --> 59:35.246
Much too good for children.

59:40.202 --> 59:42.330
Have one.

59:45.916 --> 59:49.420
No, she'd notice.

59:49.586 --> 59:53.011
Where's Lissy Doll?
Upstairs.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.685
Matilda.

59:59.346 --> 01:00:00.438
What?

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.354
Matilda.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.738
You filthy--
Crush the little weasel!

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.121
This is my room.

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.128
That's my dad.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.960
What's his name?
Magnus.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:30.219
I used to call him King Magnus
and he called me Bumblebee.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.594
I don't think Magnus
killed himself.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.224
Neither do I.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:39.887
Is that Lissy Doll?

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:47.440
Wormwood, you
useless, used-car-salesman scum!

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:51.607
I want you around here now
with another car!

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.411
Yes, I know what caveat emptor
means, you lowlife liar!

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.993
I'm gonna sue you. I'm gonna
burn down your showroom!

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.535
I'm gonna take that no-good jalopy you
sold me and shove it up your bazooga!

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:06.046
When I'm finished with you,
you're gonna look like roadkill!

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.047
You what? Ha, ha, you--

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.197
Come on.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.868
Shouldn't we hide or something?
Yeah. Yeah, go.

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.251
Go to the end of the hall, down the
stairs and out the kitchen door.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:46.377
I'll distract her.

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.428
Who's in my house?!

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:05.222
Come out and fight like a man!

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:40.347
Aha!

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.284
Tallyho!

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.127
Oh.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.098
Oh!

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.534
Come on, come on.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.346
Come on, over there.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.855
Some rats are gonna die today.

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:14.142
Oh, my goodness.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.019
Feel my heart.

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:21.062
Weren't you the most scared
you've ever been in your whole life?

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:25.611
Come on, let's go.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:29.243
She shouldn't be allowed
to treat people like that.

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:32.246
Somebody's gotta teach her a lesson.
I know.

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.909
We'll wait until she leaves again,
then we'll go get your doll.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.336
What?
Just kidding.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.292
Come here.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:49.047
Matilda, promise me you will never
go back in that house again.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:51.474
I promise.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.473
Okay. Come on.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:07.316
Ha-ha-ha. So he came home
with $2000 cash

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.450
and he threw it up in the air

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:14.957
<i>and we both just swam in it like
we were on The Million Dollar Sticky.</i>

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:17.784
Do you like that show?

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.919
I love that show.

01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:21.546
That was the old days.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:25.584
Now he's got money in banks all over
this planet, and does he give me a dime?

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.971
Matilda, this is Bob and Bill.
They're cops.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.717
They are not cops. They are
Ace Powerboat salesmen.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.351
Babyface, I'm starved!

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.189
Hi, Harry.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.974
Who are you?

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.690
What is this, a hot tub party?
Get the hell out of here!

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:48.823
I slave all day, I come home, you're entertaining
a couple of surfer-dude bodybuilders.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.570
They're cops, Dad.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.578
You interested in time-share?
Get out of here.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.662
You don't let me talk to people.
I am in a cage, Harry.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:01.374
I need to talk to somebody
besides our stupid kids.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:05.257
Oh, yeah? A man is entitled to come
home and find dinner on the table

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:08.335
without having to wade
through male strippers!

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.378
Dad?
What do you want?

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:14.553
- Yell at me, okay?
- Shut up and leave us alone!

01:08:15.383 --> 01:08:17.852
- Yell at me again.
- Yell at you?

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.354
I'll come in and pound
your miserable hide!

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.935
What do I have to do
to gain respect around here?!

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.773
I'm gonna give you a tanning like
you've never had in your life!

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.529
My word is my law!
You understand?! Law!

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.575
<i>No kid likes being yelled at,</i>

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.582
<i>but it was precisely
Harry's ranting and raving</i>

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.038
<i>that gave Matilda
the key to her power.</i>

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:46.627
<i>To unlock that power,
all she had to do was practice.</i>

01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:59.227
You're a little cheat.
What, are you stupid?

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.514
I'm smart, you're dumb.
The apple never rots far from the tree.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.307
I think there is something
wrong with that girl.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.818
I'm right, you're wrong.
Hey, dip-face, here's your book.

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:11.072
You're a Wormwood.
It's time you started acting like one!

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:54.149
<i>♪ Little bitty pretty one
Come on and talk to me ♪</i>

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:59.829
<i>♪ Lovey dovey lovey one
Come sit down on my knee ♪</i>

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:16.046
<i>♪ Tell you a story
Happened long time ago ♪</i>

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:21.434
<i>♪ Little bitty pretty one
I've been watchin' you grow ♪</i>

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:25.939
<i>That was my personal favorite played
especially for all you little bitty pretty ones</i>

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.815
<i>moving and grooving
on this sunny afternoon.</i>

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:31.228
<i>Playing music to make you smile,
so you'd better not touch that d--</i>

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.287
Shouldn't we have a search
warrant to do this?

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:47.828
No, this guy's dirty.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:51.874
Once we show this tape in court,
Wormwood's goose is cooked.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:55.589
I'm sure that box is full
of stolen car parts.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.678
You've been taping all week.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:00.681
How about letting me handle
that camera for a while?

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.592
You know how to use it?

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.353
You know about the zoom
and the white balance?

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:09.482
You know how to adjust the eyepiece?
I can handle it.

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:15.196
Besides, it's my turn.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.948
Yeah, your turn to drop it.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.860
I won't drop it.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.745
Come on.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:27.204
You two men are gonna be
in a lot of trouble very soon.

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:30.040
It's the female minor.

01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:33.172
Aren't you supposed
to be in school, young lady?

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.379
I really hope you have
a search warrant.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:38.841
According to a constitutional
law book I read in the library,

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:43.383
if you don't have one, you could lose
your job or even go to federal prison.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.723
It's your father who's
going to federal prison.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:49.059
And you know where you'll end up?
In a federal orphanage.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.645
If you cooperate, we'll make
sure it's a nice orphanage.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:56.066
The kind with food
and teeny-weeny cockroaches.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:57.276
What do you say?

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:03.487
There's another crime in the making.
Your car's about to run a stop sign.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.259
<i>So she bought a little time
for her dad to come to his senses.</i>

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.421
<i>But now Matilda had
bigger fish to fry,</i>

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.635
<i>much bigger.</i>

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.942
Hey, dip-face,
where are you going?

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.156
Out.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:49.949
Hey, dip-face, have a carrot.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:06.140
Chew your food.
You're an animal.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.472
<i>Having power
isn't nearly as important</i>

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.562
<i>as what you choose to do with it.</i>

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:19.901
<i>And what Matilda had in mind
was nothing short of heroic.</i>

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:46.990
Come here. Come on.
Lissy Doll, come on.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:50.153
Come, Lissy. Come on, doll.
Please. Come on.

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.447
Come on, Lissy.
Please come here.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:09.797
Yes!

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.536
Leave me alone!

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.401
Magnus!

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:35.094
Miss Honey! Miss Honey,
you'll never believe what I got you.

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.639
Oh, Matilda.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.305
Matilda.
Oh, I also brought you this.

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.311
I ate mine last night.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:02.201
I will be teaching
your class today.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.873
<i>In the time it took Miss
Honey to get very, very nervous,</i>

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:15.088
<i>Matilda had formulated a plan.</i>

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:18.011
She is really raving mad.

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:21.595
What is it your father used to call you?
Hummingbird?

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.261
Bumblebee. I'm sure
she knows the doll's missing.

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.304
And he called her
Trunchbull?

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:31.101
No, I suppose he called her
Agatha. Yes, that's--

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:35.488
She called him Magnus, right?
Yeah. Yes.

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:39.867
Maybe I could go back to the house and put
the doll back while she's still at school.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:43.537
Tsk. No, I can't do that.
Calm down, Miss Honey. Really.

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.619
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:49.202
Sweetheart, you promised you wouldn't
go back in that house again.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:53.623
I didn't. I was on the garage roof.
I did it with my powers.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.505
Okay, on the garage roof
with your powers.

01:19:56.667 --> 01:20:00.046
All right, I need to think.
Let's see.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.908
Powers.
Mm-hm.

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.744
I think I've got them down.
Watch this.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.438
No more Miss Nice Girl.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:56.603
Get inside.
Inside! Quickly, run!

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:59.773
Run! Get against the wall!
Against that wall. Quickly!

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.736
Don't make me wait.

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:03.993
Water!

01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.366
And hold the newt.

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.786
Join the ranks. Move!

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:21.131
I am here to teach
you all a lesson.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:30.224
Sometimes in life, horrible
and unexplainable things happen.

01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:38.193
These things are a test of character.

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.700
And I have character.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:49.409
Form a line across the room! Quickly!
Run, run, run! Don't keep me waiting.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.324
Fill this gap!

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:57.000
I expect you're wondering
what I'm talking about. Hm?

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:59.590
Yes.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:03.093
A child came to my house.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:07.007
I don't know how, I don't
know when, I don't know why.

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:09.846
Miss Trunchbull, may I--?
No, you may not.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.979
But I know a child came.

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:17.859
So did you know it was illegal

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:21.691
to enter someone's home
without their permission?

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:25.700
Yes, Miss Trunchbull.
Sir.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:28.077
Stand straight!
Stomachs in! Shoulders back!

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:32.198
Do any of you recognize...

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:34.871
this?

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.626
Hmm?

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.413
Let's play a game. Shall we?

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:45.053
Who was wearing a pretty
red hair ribbon yesterday

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.054
and isn't wearing one today?

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:51.308
Can you answer me that?

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:56.724
Who does this
disgusting ribbon belong to?

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.892
I shall personally see to it

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:03.562
that the demented, drooling,
slime-breathed little Lilliputian

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:06.403
who owns this disgusting ribbon

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:11.071
will never see the light
of day again. You.

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:14.786
Miss Trunchbull, I was the one who was
at your house last night. I know what--

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:18.748
I broke your arm once before,
I can do it again, Jenny.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:21.460
I am not 7 years old
anymore, Aunt Trunchbull.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.593
Shut your holes!

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:29.426
You will be put away in a place

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:34.344
where not even the crows
can land their droppings on you.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:35.765
Look.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:39.523
- The chalk.
- The chalk.

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.025
- Chalk.
- The blinds.

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:49.950
"A."
"Agatha...

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:55.160
this is Magnus.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:59.497
Give my...

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.788
little Bumblebee...

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:05.003
her house...

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.963
and her money."

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.470
- Money?
- "Then get out of town.

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:13.883
If you don't, I will get you.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:18.099
I will get you like you got me.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.356
That is a promise."

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.970
No, no, Miss Trunchbull,
please don't throw him.

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:55.071
Woo-hoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.464
- Lavender!
- Lavender!

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.221
- Neat!
- That's cool.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:10.150
It's the Trunch.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:15.781
Wow!
Hey, you guys, look at this.

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:17.566
Yes!

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.325
Let go.

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:29.787
Wow. Cool. I didn't know
I could do that.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:32.001
Pretty good, huh?

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:40.972
Aah!

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:49.352
Yeah!

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:23.216
<i>And the Trunchbull was gone,
never to be seen or heard from,</i>

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:26.180
<i>never to darken a doorway again.</i>

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.894
<i>Miss Honey moved back
into her father's house.</i>

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.399
Teatime.

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:34.355
<i>Of course, Matilda was
a frequent visitor.</i>

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:38.944
Did you know that the heart of a mouse
beats at the rate of 650 times a minute?

01:28:39.231 --> 01:28:42.280
My, where'd you learn that?
In a book.

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:46.072
It beats so fast, it doesn't sound like beating at all.
it sounds like it's humming.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:49.408
A porcupine's heart beats
300 times a minute.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.993
- All right.
- Quick!

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:53.791
Hey, you.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.834
Hey, we're leaving. Let's go.
Get in the car. Hurry up.

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:01.010
Let's wrap up these cookies.
Come on, we're leaving. Now.

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.842
I'd be happy
to walk her home.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.845
Well, nobody will be there.
We're moving to Guam.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.509
Come on, let's go.
Guam?

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.724
Daddy's not gonna be in
the auto business anymore.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:12.181
I don't want to leave.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.315
But we're going
on a permanent vacation.

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:17.277
Yeah, and we gotta beat the
speedboat salesmen to the airport.

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:21.030
I love it here.
I love my school. It isn't fair.

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.532
Miss Honey, please
don't let them take me.

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.113
Get in the car, Melinda.
Matilda.

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.404
Whatever.
I want to stay with Miss Honey.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:28.368
Well, Miss Honey
doesn't want you.

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:30.624
Why would she want some
snotty, disobedient kid?

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:34.457
Because she's a spectacularly
wonderful child, and I love her.

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.336
Adopt me, Miss Honey.
You can adopt me.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.626
Look, I don't have time
for all these legalities.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.136
One second, Dad,
I have the adoption papers.

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:44.717
What?

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.258
Hey, where'd you get those?
From a book in the library.

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.722
I've had them since
I was big enough to Xerox.

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.096
Are you hearing this, Harry?

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.729
All you have to do is sign them.
I'll be an only child again.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:30:00.863
Shut up! I can't think
with all these sirens.

01:30:02.606 --> 01:30:04.825
What do you think, pumpkin?

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:10.323
You're the only daughter
I ever had, Matilda.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:14.243
And I never understood you,
not one little bit.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.339
Who's got a pen?

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:24.003
Here.
Thanks.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:29.717

thing they ever did for their daughter,</i>

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:33.478

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:36.769

Okay.

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.654
All right, come on. Here.
Turn around.

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:48.527
You're not gonna be calling us for support
payments or something like that, huh?

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.822
Oh, no, no. We'll have everything we need.
Don't worry.

01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:54.036
All right, here. Let's roll.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:00.751
