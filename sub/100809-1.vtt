WEBVTT

06:07.551 --> 06:10.087
Evening, Mrs. Kane.

06:10.121 --> 06:12.356
This can go two ways.

06:12.389 --> 06:16.026
You come out, listen
to our proposal,

06:16.060 --> 06:17.561
or we can come in.

06:21.731 --> 06:24.068
If we have to come in, well,

06:28.305 --> 06:32.642
there ain't gonna be much
room for a negotiation.

06:34.945 --> 06:37.781
I told you she'd
listen to reason.

06:39.450 --> 06:42.153
Ain't got nothin'
to say to you boys.

06:42.186 --> 06:46.590
Oh, that's good because
we got a lot to say to you.

06:47.825 --> 06:49.426
I understand our
old man's Jew lawyer

06:49.460 --> 06:52.897
gave you a more than
fair offer on this place.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.431
I ain't sellin'.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.234
I heard.

06:58.369 --> 06:59.870
It's a shame, too.

07:01.038 --> 07:04.341
They just soon let you
die here, old woman.

07:09.947 --> 07:12.883
See, old man, he
got soft with age.

07:18.088 --> 07:19.290
Me and my brothers here,

07:19.323 --> 07:22.493
we just thought we'd
try and convince you.

07:24.628 --> 07:26.297
You thought wrong.

07:27.264 --> 07:29.300
She ain't goin' for it.

07:30.534 --> 07:31.869
It's okay, JR.

07:33.437 --> 07:35.773
We just haven't
given her a chance

07:35.806 --> 07:37.408
for our counter proposal yet.

07:37.441 --> 07:39.176
What are you doing?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.953
That there is a contract.

07:48.986 --> 07:52.590
Same as what Mr.
Rosenburg showed you.

07:52.623 --> 07:56.060
My brothers will be back
tomorrow night to collect it.

07:56.093 --> 07:56.927
Signed.

07:59.063 --> 08:02.566
Do you self a favor,
lady, take the money.

08:10.341 --> 08:11.609
Let's go, boys.

08:12.710 --> 08:16.080
Give Mrs. Kane a chance
to think it over.

08:16.113 --> 08:19.049
Oh, and you can keep that knife.

08:19.083 --> 08:22.486
If we come back tomorrow
night and there's no contract,

08:22.519 --> 08:24.421
probably gonna need it.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.826
You uh, you say
it was Wayne what done this?

09:02.860 --> 09:04.561
That's right.

09:04.595 --> 09:07.598
Yeah, don't sound
like him at all.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.934
Tar tracks right over there.

09:12.836 --> 09:17.374
Problem is, I don't see
nothing here outta place.

09:17.408 --> 09:21.612
Probably just some good
old boys out for a laugh.

09:21.645 --> 09:22.479
Maybe.

09:24.615 --> 09:26.950
Well, we done what we could.

09:28.385 --> 09:31.989
I reckon if we spot your
boys up on your property,

09:32.022 --> 09:33.590
we'll throw 'em
lockup for a sit,

09:33.624 --> 09:40.164
but uh, I got tire treads,
your word, sayin' they was

09:40.197 --> 09:44.868
drivin' a truck not unlike
your truck, doin' donuts, so.

09:45.736 --> 09:47.438
It was them.

09:47.471 --> 09:48.405
Prove it.

09:49.273 --> 09:51.642
You want some advice, ma'am?

09:51.675 --> 09:54.011
I want you to do your job.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.716
Word around town
is that Bill Senior

09:58.749 --> 10:01.753
done made an offer
on this place.

10:01.786 --> 10:03.253
Take it.

10:03.287 --> 10:04.789
I ain't sellin'.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.562
Yeah, and we
was all real sorry

10:11.595 --> 10:14.198
to hear about your
husband's passing.

10:14.231 --> 10:17.735
But you, a woman your
age, him not around,

10:19.970 --> 10:21.872
I can't keep coming up
here every time these boys

10:21.905 --> 10:23.507
come up and play a prank.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.375
A prank?

10:26.243 --> 10:29.980
Tire tracks, vandalism,
trespassing, maybe.

10:32.649 --> 10:34.151
It was them.

10:34.184 --> 10:35.854
Says you.

10:44.796 --> 10:49.733
You're protecting them.

10:49.768 --> 10:52.669
You might wanna
watch your tone, ma'am.

10:52.703 --> 10:55.239
Now, you're talking to the law.

10:56.407 --> 10:59.410
I'm only gonna say this once.

10:59.443 --> 11:02.847
If I find out you
embellished one detail,

11:04.014 --> 11:05.549
I will come back
here and lock you up

11:05.582 --> 11:08.485
for filing a false report.

11:08.519 --> 11:09.420
That clear?

11:12.990 --> 11:13.792
Ma'am.

11:15.192 --> 11:16.026
Pyle.

11:23.868 --> 11:25.702
What's goin' on, Mama?

11:32.709 --> 11:34.144
This ain't right.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.248
The deputy see this?

11:38.282 --> 11:41.285
Jessie married
himself a MacMohan.

11:42.219 --> 11:43.620
He's one of them.

11:48.725 --> 11:49.560
Mama.

11:51.161 --> 11:54.965
Mama, you gotta go
straight to the sheriff.

11:54.998 --> 11:56.700
Maybe the news media.

11:58.870 --> 12:01.806
This ain't right!

12:01.840 --> 12:04.776
You got a knife probably
covered in prints.

12:04.809 --> 12:06.577
A contract with his
old man's name on it.

12:06.610 --> 12:09.848
It's pretty damn
clear what's goin' on!

12:20.090 --> 12:23.360
At least come stay
with me tonight.

12:23.393 --> 12:26.396
You're not staying
here alone again.

12:27.966 --> 12:28.967
You hear me?

12:33.805 --> 12:37.909
Mama, these boys are not
taking no for an answer.

12:41.078 --> 12:42.780
This is serious!

12:42.814 --> 12:45.783
Mama, you have got
to listen to me.

12:45.817 --> 12:48.018
Look, I know you miss Daddy,

12:48.051 --> 12:50.320
but he ain't here
to protect you.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.489
Back in the...

12:52.523 --> 12:54.124
This is my house.

13:25.289 --> 13:26.623
Sorry.

13:29.126 --> 13:32.462
I built this room,
I built yours, too.

13:37.601 --> 13:39.603
I didn't know.

13:41.271 --> 13:43.908
No one bothered to ask.

13:43.942 --> 13:46.276
No one ever bothered to ask.

13:49.313 --> 13:51.515
Oh, Mama.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.020
Womanhood ain't no handicap.

13:56.054 --> 13:58.056
You remember that, girl.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.192
I loved your father.

14:03.360 --> 14:07.065
I still do, but I
ain't here for him.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.432
I'm here for me.

14:12.235 --> 14:14.638
Damn, you boys have
no luck with women.

14:14.671 --> 14:15.907
Fuck you.

14:15.940 --> 14:18.009
I need another beer.

14:18.042 --> 14:21.678
- It's your turn anyway.
- I'll take one.

14:21.712 --> 14:23.280
Shuffle.

14:23.313 --> 14:25.016
You keep asking me to shuffle,
I'm gonna start cheating.

14:25.049 --> 14:26.249
Come on, now, come on.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.752
You ain't smart
enough to cheat.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.754
You don't gotta be smart
to cheat, motherfucker.

14:29.787 --> 14:32.456
Ah, you gotta be smart
to not get caught cheatin'.

14:32.489 --> 14:35.525
Oh, do you gotta be smart,
it's not good cheatin'.

14:35.559 --> 14:37.427
Ain't neither one
of yous caught on yet.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.629
Yeah, what are you saying?

14:38.662 --> 14:40.098
You've been cheating
this whole time?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.498
He's just trying to
get in your head, Derrek.

14:41.531 --> 14:43.034
- I know that.
- It's like Pop says,

14:43.067 --> 14:48.072
"Gamblin' is 50% psychological,
and 50% lady luck."

14:49.172 --> 14:50.942
- He does say that.
- Is that so?

14:52.043 --> 14:54.311
Don't you try that shit on me.

14:54.344 --> 14:55.545
So, you cheatin' or not?

14:55.579 --> 14:57.714
It don't matter.

14:57.748 --> 14:59.483
I think it matters.

14:59.516 --> 15:00.450
This matters.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.820
Can we talk about tonight?

15:04.254 --> 15:06.891
Ain't nothin' to talk about.

15:06.924 --> 15:08.392
Agree to disagree.

15:08.425 --> 15:11.996
I think there's a whole
hell of lot to talk about.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.866
There something
on your mind, JR?

15:16.366 --> 15:21.304
That stubborn old bitch ain't
gonna sign that damn paper.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.941
She ain't got no choice.

15:23.975 --> 15:25.575
Oh, come on, Wayne.

15:25.609 --> 15:27.945
This ain't like gamblin'.

15:27.979 --> 15:29.546
What hand are you gonna play

15:29.579 --> 15:32.315
when that woman
calls your bluff?

15:34.518 --> 15:35.619
Who says I'm bluffin'?

15:35.652 --> 15:38.555
Wait, wait, we're not planning

15:38.588 --> 15:41.025
on hurtin' this woman, right?

15:42.693 --> 15:43.995
- Planning?
- Yeah.

15:44.028 --> 15:44.862
- No.
- No.

15:47.664 --> 15:50.500
What the hell is
he talking about?

15:54.504 --> 15:59.509
I think what he's saying
is, whatever happens, happens.

16:00.243 --> 16:01.278
There ain't no plan.

16:01.311 --> 16:03.313
Does that,.

16:03.346 --> 16:04.581
Does that sound
like a threat to you

16:04.614 --> 16:06.416
because that sounds
like a threat to me.

16:06.450 --> 16:07.684
You know, last night's
fine and whatever,

16:07.718 --> 16:10.420
she's listening to
reason, I get it.

16:11.823 --> 16:14.324
But you wanna take it farther?

16:14.357 --> 16:15.559
You wanna do more?

16:15.592 --> 16:16.961
Let me know, let
me know the plan.

16:16.994 --> 16:18.228
I wanna be in on it.

16:18.261 --> 16:20.765
I wanna know the plan,
I wanna know the plan.

16:20.798 --> 16:23.034
It's just like I said.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.502
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

16:25.535 --> 16:28.739
As long as there's a signed
contract when we show up.

16:28.773 --> 16:31.809
Sure,
and if there isn't?

16:31.843 --> 16:32.910
There will be.

16:32.944 --> 16:33.778
Mm.

16:36.313 --> 16:37.882
But if there isn't?

16:42.586 --> 16:44.354
She's an old woman.

16:45.890 --> 16:47.357
Accidents happen.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.997
Have you talked
to Pops about this?

16:54.297 --> 16:56.234
Pops ain't got
nothin' to do with this.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.701
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

16:57.734 --> 17:00.637
- It's between us.
- No, I hear you.

17:01.806 --> 17:04.976
I'm gonna talk to
Pops about this.

17:05.009 --> 17:07.078
- Sit down.
- Huh?

17:13.050 --> 17:15.417
I said, sit down.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.789
Trying to scare me, Wayne?

17:19.723 --> 17:21.058
You're bluffin'.

17:24.228 --> 17:27.799
Am I?

17:29.133 --> 17:30.400
Well, are ya?

17:35.505 --> 17:36.941
You two clear out.

17:36.974 --> 17:39.076
I wanna have a word
with your brother here.

17:39.110 --> 17:41.344
- Sure, Daddy.
- You got it.

17:48.986 --> 17:53.257
What exactly are you
plannin' on doing with that?

17:56.828 --> 18:00.430
Say Derrek didn't sit
back down, what then?

18:02.033 --> 18:04.035
I guess we won't know.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.603
That so?

18:15.980 --> 18:17.547
He was gonna sit.

18:19.851 --> 18:21.853
And what if he didn't?

18:28.025 --> 18:29.093
You wouldn't.

18:31.829 --> 18:34.364
You don't know that.

18:34.397 --> 18:37.335
You're a goddamn savage.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.303
Just like your old man.

18:40.872 --> 18:42.539
Only one difference.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.109
Yeah, what's that?

18:48.346 --> 18:50.413
You ain't got the sack
to go through with it.

19:08.132 --> 19:11.601
So, you boys been hassling
that old woman, huh?

19:12.770 --> 19:14.604
Just doin' what's
right, that's all.

19:14.638 --> 19:16.307
No, ain't no right or wrong,

19:16.340 --> 19:19.010
and if there was, it ain't that.

19:20.610 --> 19:22.280
Agree to disagree.

19:23.381 --> 19:26.616
Oh, so, you a crusader
then, is that it?

19:27.584 --> 19:30.087
Out fighting for what's right.

19:30.121 --> 19:32.890
One whole lonely
widow at a time.

19:36.693 --> 19:39.864
You're just doin' it
because you want to.

19:39.897 --> 19:41.198
Is that right?

19:41.232 --> 19:43.134
Just 'cause you a man,

19:43.167 --> 19:47.470
don't mean that I won't
straighten you out, do you hear?

19:47.504 --> 19:49.673
Think I don't know my own?

19:51.675 --> 19:52.676
Look at you.

19:54.711 --> 19:57.614
You pull a gun on
your own brother.

19:58.682 --> 19:59.917
It's a bluff.

20:01.152 --> 20:05.089
You've been bluffing
your whole goddamn life.

20:06.723 --> 20:08.392
Everyone backs down.

20:11.494 --> 20:14.832
You just a fight in
search of an insult.

20:32.183 --> 20:34.051
You have half a life left.

20:34.085 --> 20:35.453
Assumin' someone
bigger and badder

20:35.485 --> 20:38.856
doesn't come along
and take care of it.

20:40.992 --> 20:42.326
Now, that woman.

20:44.028 --> 20:46.864
Hell, heartache'll
kill her before

20:48.065 --> 20:50.567
I'm finished with this bottle.

20:54.071 --> 20:57.741
If this was just about
the dirt beneath her,

21:00.311 --> 21:01.779
you'd wait for it.

21:04.581 --> 21:05.648
But it ain't.

21:07.684 --> 21:12.156
You're wrong.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.428
I guess we'll
find out tonight.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.598
When you go around come midnight

21:21.631 --> 21:26.636
and go knocking on her door,

21:27.505 --> 21:28.906
and there ain't no answer.

21:30.775 --> 21:31.608
What then?

21:37.181 --> 21:39.417
Just a gun with no bullets.

21:44.488 --> 21:47.058
Eh, but hey, maybe she'll fold.

21:52.496 --> 21:55.433
You've gotten this
far on bullshit.

21:57.201 --> 21:58.002
Hey.

21:59.904 --> 22:03.974
How'd you know there were
no bullets in that gun?

22:05.342 --> 22:08.979
I didn't.

22:15.019 --> 22:17.455
And we ask these blessings
in the name of the Father,

22:17.488 --> 22:19.757
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

22:22.725 --> 22:27.331
You know, God doesn't give
us what we can't handle.

22:27.364 --> 22:30.000
I appreciate your
prayers, Brother David,

22:30.034 --> 22:31.969
but I ain't here to pray.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.636
I need help.

22:33.670 --> 22:37.575
Well, maybe the Lord put the
answer right in front of you?

22:37.607 --> 22:38.876
Pray for sight.

22:41.178 --> 22:43.646
Come midnight tonight,

22:43.680 --> 22:45.715
I may just have to
ask him in person.

22:45.748 --> 22:46.584
Marsha.

22:49.887 --> 22:53.656
Your husband is at
peace with the Lord.

22:53.690 --> 22:56.293
You know, I look out over my
congregation every Sunday,

22:56.327 --> 22:57.995
and I don't see you.

22:59.396 --> 23:03.100
And as much as your
situation pains me,

23:03.134 --> 23:05.536
it is good to see you.

23:05.569 --> 23:07.004
And I think that maybe the Lord

23:07.037 --> 23:10.474
put you in that situation
to bring you peace.

23:11.674 --> 23:14.278
To bring you back to the church.

23:16.780 --> 23:20.951
That house is a tomb and
you've been locked in it.

23:22.153 --> 23:23.387
Take the money.

23:24.255 --> 23:25.422
Free yourself.

23:26.590 --> 23:30.127
Walk the path the Lord
has laid before you.

23:32.662 --> 23:33.497
Thanks.

23:52.783 --> 23:54.552
Hey, Mama, it's me.

23:54.585 --> 23:57.188
Look, Loretta asked to work
the late shift since Lee's

23:57.221 --> 24:00.690
been spending every dime on
pills since his accident.

24:00.723 --> 24:05.129
So, I'm free and I thought
I'd bring by dinner.

24:05.162 --> 24:07.831
Now, I know you can
handle yourself,

24:07.865 --> 24:11.502
but no sense in us
both eating alone.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.638
Anyway, I know you don't
check these things,

24:14.672 --> 24:16.607
but if you do, take
out an extra plate.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.942
I'll be there soon.

27:16.587 --> 27:18.188
Anybody hurt?

27:21.258 --> 27:23.594
I'm a fuckin' idiot,
I'm a fuckin' idiot!

27:23.627 --> 27:25.662
That kinda talk
don't do no good, JR.

27:25.696 --> 27:26.597
I shouldn't
have been standing

27:26.630 --> 27:28.499
right in front of the door.

27:28.532 --> 27:32.002
Ain't none of us coulda known.

27:32.035 --> 27:33.203
- Derrek.
- What?

27:34.773 --> 27:36.340
Get me the first aid kit.

27:42.646 --> 27:44.214
I'm hurt bad.

27:44.248 --> 27:45.315
She got me good.

27:45.349 --> 27:47.518
No, she didn't, JR.

27:47.551 --> 27:49.821
You just got shot, little
brother, all right?

27:49.854 --> 27:51.021
You ain't dead yet.

27:51.054 --> 27:53.957
Sure feels
like I'm dying.

28:01.298 --> 28:04.468
We gotta get him
to a fuckin' doctor.

28:04.501 --> 28:06.103
Wayne, let's cut out, man.

28:06.136 --> 28:07.137
Billy's hurt bad.

28:07.171 --> 28:08.840
Get the damn guns.

28:24.889 --> 28:27.224
You know what we
came up here to do.

28:27.257 --> 28:29.226
All right, you just
take hold of that.

28:29.259 --> 28:32.563
You hold that pain in
like a man, all right?

28:32.596 --> 28:35.599
We're gonna bring her out here

28:35.632 --> 28:38.903
and I'm gonna let
you pull the trigger.

28:40.070 --> 28:41.305
Wayne, I got, I got,
I got, got, got, got hit

28:41.338 --> 28:42.239
by a spread shot in my arm.

28:42.272 --> 28:44.107
Let's go, like, let's go.

28:44.141 --> 28:47.544
JR is worse than you
and me put together.

28:47.578 --> 28:51.114
I'm losing a lot
of blood, Wayne.

28:51.148 --> 28:52.483
That ain't gonna stop.

28:52.516 --> 28:54.919
Just try and be calm.

28:54.953 --> 28:56.587
Try and slow your heart rate.

28:56.620 --> 28:58.555
This is not worth it.

29:00.057 --> 29:01.558
Blood for blood.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.162
- Ain't that right, JR?
- Mm hm.

29:08.165 --> 29:10.802
You hear me, you old witch?

29:10.835 --> 29:12.503
We're comin' for ya.

29:15.439 --> 29:17.341
So, what do we do?

29:17.374 --> 29:20.077
It's just an old
woman in there.

29:20.110 --> 29:22.045
She can't cover every
door and window.

29:22.079 --> 29:23.547
She doesn't have to cover
every door and window,

29:23.580 --> 29:26.083
just the right one, obviously.

29:27.284 --> 29:30.521
There ain't nothin'
left to discuss, Derrek.

29:30.554 --> 29:31.990
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

29:32.022 --> 29:34.157
- You see that?
- Yes!

29:34.191 --> 29:35.292
Suck it up.

29:36.660 --> 29:39.363
Why don't you stick your
head through that fuckin' door.

29:39.396 --> 29:41.799
There's three of
us and one of her.

29:41.833 --> 29:43.033
There's three?

29:43.066 --> 29:44.268
I think there's two by
my count, motherfucker.

29:44.301 --> 29:46.169
I don't think he can
do too much right now.

29:46.203 --> 29:48.840
I don't think this is
stopping the bleeding, Wayne.

29:48.873 --> 29:52.409
I ain't gonna
stop, not without surgery.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.546
Now, can you pull a trigger?

29:55.579 --> 29:56.814
I don't know.

29:58.148 --> 30:00.952
The fuck is he gonna do?

30:00.985 --> 30:04.121
He's gonna distract her
while we go around back.

30:04.154 --> 30:06.657
I don't think I can
pull the trigger, Wayne.

30:06.690 --> 30:07.792
- Look.
- My hands,

30:07.825 --> 30:09.961
they don't feel right.

30:09.994 --> 30:12.596
Look, can you sit up?

30:15.532 --> 30:17.200
All right, all right.

30:17.234 --> 30:18.735
Wayne, let's go.

30:19.603 --> 30:21.104
All right, he is going...

30:21.138 --> 30:24.976
Ain't nobody goin' in the
dirt, but that old woman.

30:25.009 --> 30:27.110
Now, let's do this.

30:27.144 --> 30:30.480
Don't get chickenshit
and run off on me.

30:33.383 --> 30:34.217
Okay.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.990
You made a big mistake, lady.

30:40.223 --> 30:42.659
It only gets worse from here.

30:46.496 --> 30:50.334
And you can still make
it easy on yourself.

30:50.367 --> 30:54.237
Just toss that heater
through the door

30:54.271 --> 30:56.173
and come out real slow.

31:01.111 --> 31:03.447
We can put you down
real humane like.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.822
The deal don't get
no better than that.

31:10.855 --> 31:11.655
You hear?

31:21.032 --> 31:22.199
Fuck you!

31:22.232 --> 31:23.067
Fuck you!

31:24.735 --> 31:26.670
You're so fuckin' dead.

31:28.372 --> 31:32.944
Only witch in this town, ain't
nobody see you on Sundays.

31:36.246 --> 31:37.081
A devil.

31:38.515 --> 31:40.384
That's what you are.

31:40.417 --> 31:42.987
A no good, goddamn devil woman.

31:47.691 --> 31:52.329
My old man, he plays
cards with Pastor Knight,

31:52.362 --> 31:53.697
every Wednesday.

31:55.099 --> 31:58.201
And one time I
overheard 'em talkin'.

31:59.369 --> 32:02.673
About this thing
called trial by battle.

32:03.841 --> 32:07.411
It's when two people
are in conflict.

32:07.444 --> 32:11.248
Ain't no witnesses, no
law, no judge, no jury.

32:14.251 --> 32:16.054
Whoever wins is right.

32:19.656 --> 32:22.760
And God don't let
the innocent loose.

32:25.595 --> 32:29.599
You mighta gut shot me,
bitch, but I ain't dead.

32:34.271 --> 32:35.706
- You ain't killed me.
- Fuck.

32:35.739 --> 32:36.841
I'm not.

32:36.874 --> 32:39.276
Because this is your trial.

32:40.677 --> 32:41.879
You're being judged

32:41.913 --> 32:43.246
by God almighty.

32:51.155 --> 32:54.491
And when your time
comes, I'll be his wrath!

33:03.034 --> 33:04.401
Last chance.

33:04.434 --> 33:05.837
Scoop up your brother's insides

33:05.870 --> 33:08.572
and get the fuck
off my property.

33:09.807 --> 33:11.075
There's lots of
doors and windows

33:11.109 --> 33:14.544
all over this old
place, Mrs. Kane.

33:14.578 --> 33:17.514
You can't keep that gun
trained on all of 'em.

33:17.547 --> 33:18.749
Don't have to.

33:18.783 --> 33:20.383
I just have to wait
for the next idiot

33:20.417 --> 33:24.354
to poke his head
through the wrong hole.

33:24.387 --> 33:28.092
We both know this
don't end well for you.

33:28.126 --> 33:30.194
It won't
end well for you.

33:30.228 --> 33:31.996
Wait just a minute.

33:34.065 --> 33:36.200
You blast that thing, JR,

33:36.234 --> 33:39.170
he's gonna know you
ain't at the front.

33:39.203 --> 33:41.471
He's gonna, he's
gonna come in here,

33:41.505 --> 33:43.875
he's gonna shoot
you in the back.

33:43.908 --> 33:45.742
Billy ain't
gonna do anything.

33:45.777 --> 33:47.511
Y'all gonna kill him.

33:48.712 --> 33:51.115
There's gonna be
killing all right.

33:51.149 --> 33:52.817
Well, I
guess we don't have much

33:52.850 --> 33:54.852
more to talk about then.

33:58.923 --> 34:01.025
Get the fuck over here.

34:05.229 --> 34:09.833
Y'all get her?

34:20.342 --> 34:21.179
Come on.

34:37.795 --> 34:38.628
Come on.

34:45.435 --> 34:46.270
All right.

34:47.772 --> 34:50.274
- I'm gonna go draw her out.
- Okay.

34:50.308 --> 34:54.110
She's probably holed up in
one of them rooms someplace.

34:54.145 --> 34:57.480
Wait, what if she
crawls out a window?

34:58.648 --> 35:01.651
You're 15 minutes from
the nearest neighbor.

35:01.685 --> 35:06.690
There ain't no place she can
go that we can't run her down.

35:07.424 --> 35:08.960
Let me draw her out.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.997
I know, but, listen to me.

35:13.030 --> 35:14.431
I mean, what,
like, there's like,

35:14.464 --> 35:17.101
what three or four bullets
in that thing, tops.

35:17.134 --> 35:20.171
Um, I'll uh, I'll get the back,

35:20.204 --> 35:21.504
JR's obviously got the front.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.506
He ain't goin' fuckin' nowhere.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.675
I don't wanna come
around some blind corner.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.744
She's gonna have that
thunder maker on me again.

35:27.778 --> 35:30.248
I understand, just trust me.

35:30.281 --> 35:31.115
Trust me.

35:33.184 --> 35:34.986
- All right.
- All right.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.554
Count 20.

35:39.123 --> 35:40.892
Like, starting now?

35:42.360 --> 35:43.794
- Okay.
- Starting now!

35:43.828 --> 35:46.964
- Okay, all right.
- Count 20.

35:46.998 --> 35:47.965
Out loud?

35:47.999 --> 35:49.100
Fuck it.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.043
What the fuck?

39:20.144 --> 39:24.215
Fuckin'.

39:24.248 --> 39:25.082
Ah!

39:29.253 --> 39:30.788
The hell is goin' on?

39:30.821 --> 39:32.923
Y'all keep back now,
unless you want this boy's

39:32.957 --> 39:35.493
face to look like this hand.

39:35.526 --> 39:37.694
- You shoot him and...
- And what?

39:37.727 --> 39:40.297
Y'all gonna walk through
this door one at a time.

39:40.331 --> 39:41.899
Be by guest.

39:41.932 --> 39:43.901
You shoot my brother, woman,

39:43.934 --> 39:46.971
we're gonna blast the
foundation out from this place.

39:47.004 --> 39:48.439
You can't hide in there forever.

39:48.472 --> 39:52.543
Wrong, y'all got two
brothers bleeding to death.

39:52.576 --> 39:55.079
Y'all are the ones
that can't hang around.

39:55.112 --> 40:00.117
Now, collect your wounded
and get the hell outta here.

40:01.152 --> 40:02.052
Wayne.

40:02.086 --> 40:02.987
She ain't gonna do nothin'.

40:03.020 --> 40:04.654
You so sure?

40:04.687 --> 40:06.824
How many bullets you got left?

40:06.857 --> 40:08.058
Enough.

40:08.092 --> 40:09.659
She's
not fucking around.

40:09.692 --> 40:12.930
- Shut up.
- This ain't no negotiation.

40:12.963 --> 40:16.467
Either you slide that gun
towards this here door,

40:16.500 --> 40:17.635
or they're gonna have to keep

40:17.667 --> 40:19.837
the casket shut at
your brother's funeral.

40:22.873 --> 40:24.308
There ain't no way.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.977
- 10.
- She's not fucking around!

40:28.412 --> 40:33.150
Nine, eight, seven...

40:33.184 --> 40:35.019
What the hell, Wayne?

40:35.052 --> 40:36.053
Six, five!

40:39.490 --> 40:42.059
- All right.
- All right, what?

40:42.092 --> 40:43.894
I don't see no gun.

40:43.928 --> 40:44.762
Four.

40:47.965 --> 40:50.134
Countdown's not over
until Billy slides

40:50.167 --> 40:52.803
that fuckin' smoke
wagon over this way.

40:52.836 --> 40:54.104
Three.

40:54.138 --> 40:57.441
Oh, you don't sound
urgent enough, fucker!

41:02.880 --> 41:04.582
You done killed us.

41:05.950 --> 41:08.652
Ain't nobody dead yet.

41:08.686 --> 41:10.154
Come get your brother.

41:10.187 --> 41:12.389
How do I know you
ain't gonna shoot me?

41:12.423 --> 41:14.158
You don't.

41:14.191 --> 41:16.126
Then we at an impasse.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.696
You see the way he's bleeding?

41:18.728 --> 41:20.831
You see that bright red?

41:20.864 --> 41:22.700
That's arterial blood.

41:24.101 --> 41:27.338
It's gonna keep coming with
every beat of his heart

41:27.371 --> 41:29.773
until it don't beat no more.

41:31.442 --> 41:33.911
I don't even wanna be here!

41:33.944 --> 41:37.915
And then we'll both
sit here and watch him die.

41:37.948 --> 41:41.685
All right.

41:43.787 --> 41:45.856
You keep that gun steady.

41:47.691 --> 41:49.627
I'm gonna pull him out.

42:02.573 --> 42:05.876
You.

42:05.909 --> 42:08.045
You don't pay no mind to me.

42:08.078 --> 42:10.414
Just pick him up and get moving.

42:10.447 --> 42:12.182
I'm sorry.

42:12.216 --> 42:13.017
No.

42:14.318 --> 42:16.553
You got shot by
this coward is all.

42:16.587 --> 42:19.156
Watch who you call a coward.

42:19.189 --> 42:20.824
You got my gun, lady.

42:20.858 --> 42:24.561
I ain't obliged to
be polite to you.

42:27.598 --> 42:29.066
This ain't over yet.

42:29.099 --> 42:31.669
You might wanna rethink that.

42:35.272 --> 42:37.041
You gonna shoot me?

42:38.909 --> 42:39.743
Yeah.

42:43.380 --> 42:45.215
Like I said, coward.

42:47.151 --> 42:51.555
Three men knocking on a
widows door at midnight,

42:51.588 --> 42:53.758
coming to take her land.

42:53.792 --> 42:57.294
It don't get much more
cowardly than that.

42:58.696 --> 42:59.530
Ut uh.

43:02.733 --> 43:04.234
You know what?

43:04.268 --> 43:06.670
I done changed my mind.

43:06.704 --> 43:09.673
You just became my
insurance policy.

43:11.241 --> 43:12.643
Excuse me?

43:12.676 --> 43:14.511
Sit against the wall.

43:16.647 --> 43:18.582
- Ain't no way.
- Do it!

43:21.753 --> 43:23.187
All the way down.

43:28.025 --> 43:29.526
Derrek, get going.

43:30.728 --> 43:32.529
Okay, gladly.

43:32.563 --> 43:34.833
Give me five fuckin' seconds.

43:45.943 --> 43:49.279
If you want him, you get the
sheriff to come pick him up.

43:50.547 --> 43:53.317
Wayne, what do
you want me to do?

43:55.119 --> 43:55.953
Do it.

43:57.521 --> 43:58.857
Get JR fixed up.

44:00.424 --> 44:04.863
Yeah, you sure?

44:04.895 --> 44:05.729
Go.

44:12.936 --> 44:16.306
You ever fire one of them
things before tonight?

44:16.340 --> 44:17.174
Maybe.

44:19.209 --> 44:20.477
Big damn gun.

44:22.179 --> 44:25.048
Hell, I don't know
if I could tote

44:25.082 --> 44:28.753
that son of a bitch
around that long.

44:28.787 --> 44:33.624
Must be gettin' awful tired
holding it up there like that.

44:38.228 --> 44:41.231
You're right,
this is much better.

44:46.069 --> 44:47.571
Mind if I smoke?

44:48.639 --> 44:50.140
Not in my house.

44:51.876 --> 44:53.778
Lady, I think you got
a lot bigger problems

44:53.812 --> 44:56.313
right now than a
little tobacco smoke.

44:56.346 --> 45:00.885
You light that cigarette,
it'll be your last.

45:09.593 --> 45:12.563
How long you think
this is gonna last?

45:12.596 --> 45:14.631
As long as it needs to.

45:16.868 --> 45:18.368
Ain't gonna end.

45:19.336 --> 45:20.839
Not after tonight.

45:22.206 --> 45:26.276
We'll see what the sheriff
has to say about that.

45:26.310 --> 45:28.245
What you gonna say?

45:28.278 --> 45:31.281
I'll just let the
scene do the talking.

45:31.315 --> 45:33.484
You're forgetting
one little fact.

45:33.517 --> 45:35.385
You shot first.

45:35.419 --> 45:36.487
Castle law.

45:38.489 --> 45:42.493
You shot an unarmed man
through a closed door.

45:43.427 --> 45:45.429
You all threatened me.

45:47.832 --> 45:50.501
Ain't how it's gonna play out.

45:51.668 --> 45:55.405
All I gotta say is,
we heard from Jessie,

45:55.439 --> 45:59.042
some good old boys was
giving you a hassle.

46:01.178 --> 46:03.413
You done thought it was us.

46:04.281 --> 46:06.316
And the contract?

46:06.350 --> 46:07.184
The knife?

46:11.355 --> 46:14.391
Nobody's gonna see that shit.

46:14.424 --> 46:16.727
Jessie'll make sure of that.

46:17.896 --> 46:21.465
I assume you showed it
to him this morning.

46:23.835 --> 46:27.504
Whole hell of a lot of
good that did, right?

46:31.375 --> 46:33.377
You forget where we are?

46:34.779 --> 46:39.449
Forget who my old man is?

46:40.584 --> 46:43.120
Ain't nobody give a
good goddamn about you.

46:45.255 --> 46:48.258
You just some
lonesome woman sittin'

46:49.660 --> 46:53.397
on the land that
don't belong to her.

46:56.366 --> 46:58.435
You think that scares me?

47:02.774 --> 47:07.011
My family, they've been on
this land since the war.

47:11.348 --> 47:12.516
The Civil War.

47:14.986 --> 47:17.554
The war of northern aggression.

47:19.757 --> 47:21.926
You and your dead husband,

47:25.729 --> 47:28.231
you just two more cock baggers

47:29.666 --> 47:32.269
claiming land that ain't yours.

47:38.442 --> 47:39.509
So, go ahead.

47:42.279 --> 47:44.514
Pull that trigger.

47:44.548 --> 47:48.052
Pull that hammer back,
you take your shot.

47:52.155 --> 47:53.992
I ain't afraid to die.

47:56.259 --> 47:58.295
That makes two of us.

47:58.328 --> 48:00.497
Brian, did you get it?

48:02.666 --> 48:03.868
10-4.

48:18.116 --> 48:20.084
- Where's Wayne.
- Inside.

48:20.118 --> 48:22.020
- The hell, go and get him.
- Can you walk?

48:22.053 --> 48:23.021
- Can you walk?
- Derrek!

48:23.054 --> 48:25.589
- Can you walk?
- Go get Wayne.

48:25.622 --> 48:27.290
Wayne is not
coming with us, JR.

48:27.324 --> 48:28.492
The hell he ain't.

48:28.525 --> 48:30.061
She's got him
pinned in the back.

48:30.094 --> 48:31.495
Then unpin him.

48:31.528 --> 48:33.430
She's got our fuckin' gun.

48:35.465 --> 48:36.700
What are you laughing at?

48:36.733 --> 48:37.601
What are you laughing at?

48:37.634 --> 48:39.202
Look what she did to me.

48:39.236 --> 48:41.371
Fuck you, Derrek.

48:41.405 --> 48:43.775
- Fuck.
- Look at me, look at me!

48:43.808 --> 48:45.076
I'm dying here.

48:46.610 --> 48:49.113
But at least I still got this.

48:52.749 --> 48:55.452
What did you bring for backup?

48:55.485 --> 48:58.422
Oh, let me guess, nothin'.

48:58.455 --> 49:00.323
You weren't inside.

49:00.357 --> 49:02.392
- You weren't inside.
- Shut up.

49:02.426 --> 49:04.194
How fuckin' hard is this?

49:04.227 --> 49:08.732
You're in the dark, you pick a
door, you put your gun on it.

49:08.766 --> 49:11.601
You see something move, bang!

49:11.635 --> 49:13.637
No more problem, Derrek.

49:14.705 --> 49:17.340
How fuckin' hard is that?

49:17.374 --> 49:19.609
How fuckin' hard is that?

49:19.643 --> 49:21.145
You think we had
time to do that while

49:21.179 --> 49:23.915
you're sitting here
bleeding out, you fuck!

49:23.948 --> 49:26.017
Still bleeding out, Derrek.

49:26.050 --> 49:30.955
But I see you went and got
your jerkin hand blown off,

49:30.988 --> 49:35.726
and now Wayne has got a
gun pointed at his head.

49:35.760 --> 49:39.296
How's your plan
workin' out for ya?

49:39.329 --> 49:41.364
I, I, I don't know,
let's just get Jessie.

49:41.398 --> 49:44.035
Let's get Jessie, let's go
get, let's go get Jessie.

49:44.068 --> 49:47.304
Jessie can't be
here till we're done.

49:48.806 --> 49:52.143
That's the plan, you
dumb fuckin' moose.

49:53.543 --> 49:54.444
Well, it looks like we're out

49:54.478 --> 49:56.313
of options now then, doesn't it?

49:56.346 --> 50:00.084
Oh, yeah?

50:00.118 --> 50:01.119
- Hey!
- Hey!

50:02.586 --> 50:05.089
Stop right there,
I'll run you down.

50:05.123 --> 50:06.858
Okay, just keep,
come please, come...

50:06.891 --> 50:08.291
Derrek, what the hell
are you doing out here?

50:08.325 --> 50:09.761
It's your mom, it's your mom.

50:09.794 --> 50:11.763
She's fuckin' hurt in there
and I need you to come with me.

50:11.796 --> 50:12.964
I'll go call the doctor then.

50:12.997 --> 50:14.932
We already called the doctor.

50:14.966 --> 50:16.234
Wait, we?

50:16.266 --> 50:19.269
Your brothers are out here, too?

50:19.302 --> 50:21.205
Your mom is hurt.

50:21.239 --> 50:24.407
Please follow me if
you wouldn't mind.

50:25.575 --> 50:28.712
Must've come out
here to run her off.

50:28.745 --> 50:31.314
- Hello?
- Show me your tits.

50:31.348 --> 50:32.984
Did you say,
"Show me your tits?"

50:33.017 --> 50:36.319
You heard me, asshole.

50:36.353 --> 50:38.756
What a fuckin' weird night.

50:44.762 --> 50:46.197
All the way off.

50:46.230 --> 50:49.299
Need to know you're
not hiding a gun.

50:51.568 --> 50:52.536
Goddammit.

50:57.141 --> 50:59.177
Okay, can you come now, please?

50:59.210 --> 51:00.410
- Please?
- Pants.

51:02.512 --> 51:04.015
Woman, what the
fuck did you just say?

51:04.048 --> 51:04.982
- Pants?
- Pants!

51:05.016 --> 51:06.284
- Jesus Christ.
- You deaf?

51:06.316 --> 51:07.551
Jesus Christ.

51:09.653 --> 51:10.922
It's not exactly warm out here.

51:10.955 --> 51:13.423
Keep that in mind
before I fuckin'.

51:13.456 --> 51:14.792
Won't be any
smaller than it always was...

51:14.826 --> 51:16.160
With one hand.

51:22.300 --> 51:26.070
You just stay ahead
of me and lead the way.

51:27.604 --> 51:29.040
How do you
want me to walk like this?

51:29.073 --> 51:30.942
Very carefully, hm?

51:30.975 --> 51:31.809
Get going.

51:36.948 --> 51:38.481
The gravel's hurting
the tip of my dick.

51:38.515 --> 51:39.616
Suck it up.

51:42.253 --> 51:45.056
You say, Jessie's
behind all this?

51:45.089 --> 51:47.825
Yes, all right, we have
nothing to do with this.

51:47.859 --> 51:49.160
Keep walking.

51:49.193 --> 51:52.196
- He's dirty, you know that.
- Keep walkin'!

51:52.230 --> 51:53.130
Face front.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.915
- Come on, you bitch.
- Jerk, oh, fuck!

52:10.948 --> 52:12.884
- Oh, look at that.
- No!

52:12.917 --> 52:14.752
Oh, no,.

52:14.785 --> 52:16.220
- Okay.
- Hey, hey,

52:16.254 --> 52:17.654
JR, can I borrow that
knife for a second, buddy?

52:17.687 --> 52:18.823
- Listen, you're not putting...
- Looks like the sheriff

52:18.856 --> 52:19.757
- ain't coming after all.
- Enough pressure.

52:19.790 --> 52:20.557
It's by this bitch's car.

52:20.590 --> 52:21.826
Don't fuckin' bite me.

52:21.859 --> 52:23.393
Look at my hand!

52:23.426 --> 52:24.862
Look at my fuckin' hand.

52:24.896 --> 52:26.463
- Your bitch bother blew it off.
- Uh.

52:26.496 --> 52:27.832
- Keep that gun on me.
- Where'd you get the shotgun?

52:27.865 --> 52:28.732
- Did you buy that shit?
- You don't know what

52:28.766 --> 52:29.834
- I'm able to do.
- Asshole!

52:29.867 --> 52:31.302
Hey, Marsha, listen.

52:31.335 --> 52:32.602
You didn't say we had an
extra fuckin' guest comin'.

52:32.636 --> 52:34.005
But I tell you what, I'm
gonna take care of her.

52:34.038 --> 52:35.239
Those boys ain't
gonna do nothin'...

52:35.273 --> 52:36.439
Shut the fuck up!

52:36.473 --> 52:37.641
- I'm seein' to that.
- Let go, asshole.

52:37.674 --> 52:39.110
Whenever you can,
whenever you can handle

52:39.143 --> 52:41.245
this certain situation,
I'll be right in here.

52:41.279 --> 52:44.048
Fuck this stings, shut the
fuck up or you're gonna die.

52:47.752 --> 52:49.320
I think you ease up

52:49.353 --> 52:51.055
off of my brother
right about now.

52:51.088 --> 52:55.092
If you hurt her, your brother
gets one between the eyes.

52:55.126 --> 52:56.726
Well, that goes
both ways, ma'am.

52:56.761 --> 52:57.594
Trust me.

52:58.728 --> 53:01.265
Here's your goddamn shirt.

53:01.299 --> 53:03.600
In due time, brother.

53:03.633 --> 53:04.835
Thank you.

53:04.869 --> 53:07.204
I'll just go
down for a minute.

53:08.438 --> 53:11.142
Would you happen to
be a righty or lefty?

53:11.175 --> 53:13.044
- Let's find out.
- No!

53:13.077 --> 53:17.747
Stop, this is what your
mom gave me not long ago.

53:17.782 --> 53:19.216
You're lucky
she only took one.

53:19.250 --> 53:22.485
Yeah, well, let's see
how far you get without it.

53:22.519 --> 53:25.689
Let her loose and
I'll let him walk,

53:26.556 --> 53:28.159
and y'all get on.

53:28.192 --> 53:29.827
Excuse me?

53:29.860 --> 53:32.029
Derrek, ease off.

53:32.063 --> 53:33.663
She ain't got no leverage.

53:33.697 --> 53:34.899
Don't be stupid.

53:34.932 --> 53:36.367
It's only fair!

53:54.085 --> 53:55.319
I ain't gonna do it.

53:55.353 --> 53:56.821
Come on.

53:56.854 --> 53:58.789
Come on,.

53:58.823 --> 54:01.092
It's okay, it's okay.

54:01.125 --> 54:04.261
Well, send him before
I change my mind.

54:04.295 --> 54:05.628
That's my cue.

54:08.399 --> 54:09.300
Let her go.

54:19.076 --> 54:20.444
Ma'am.

54:20.478 --> 54:23.680
Wayne, you keep
moving or so help me.

54:23.713 --> 54:25.783
It's all right, Mrs. Kane.

54:25.816 --> 54:29.220
Just reconnecting
with your oldest here.

54:29.253 --> 54:32.990
We haven't seen each
other since high school.

54:34.458 --> 54:36.861
You don't remember me do you?

54:38.996 --> 54:40.831
Eh, it's just as well.

54:42.033 --> 54:45.369
You was a senior, I
was just a freshman.

54:47.238 --> 54:50.074
Mind what I told
you about smoking.

54:51.541 --> 54:55.745
The situation has completely
changed now, Mrs. Kane.

54:56.746 --> 54:57.580
Smoke?

55:04.121 --> 55:05.790
Things have changed.

55:06.924 --> 55:09.659
I remember you
and Morgan sisters

55:09.692 --> 55:13.030
used to go smoke out
behind the stadium.

55:18.869 --> 55:20.805
Yeah, I remember you.

55:23.274 --> 55:25.376
Entitled little rich boy.

55:27.545 --> 55:30.047
Yeah, me and the Morgan sisters

55:30.081 --> 55:32.682
used to ash our cigarettes
on the stadium wall

55:32.715 --> 55:35.618
because it was your
daddy's legacy.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.457
You know, the only reason
the boys in my class

55:39.490 --> 55:42.893
didn't beat the
shit outta you is

55:42.927 --> 55:46.764
because your daddy bought
their football pads.

55:49.599 --> 55:51.102
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

55:51.135 --> 55:54.972
That's right.

55:56.739 --> 55:58.209
And keeping with tradition,

55:58.242 --> 56:01.812
I'd just as soon ash that
cigarette in your face.

56:04.215 --> 56:05.049
Hm.

56:14.758 --> 56:17.862
Fine cutlery you
got here, Mrs. Kane.

56:18.762 --> 56:20.164
Looks sharp.

56:20.197 --> 56:21.031
Uh, uh.

56:21.065 --> 56:23.000
Don't you hurt her!

56:23.033 --> 56:25.136
You ain't got
much to bargin with.

56:25.169 --> 56:26.770
Hey, Wayne.

56:26.804 --> 56:31.175
I don't think JR's doing
too good, buddy, right now.

56:31.208 --> 56:34.545
How you doin' little brother?

56:34.578 --> 56:37.882
Y'all could pull the
dirt over me right outside.

56:37.915 --> 56:41.651
As long as them two go
in the dirt next to me.

56:41.684 --> 56:43.587
We ain't goin' nowhere.

56:44.721 --> 56:46.056
You hear that?

56:47.224 --> 56:51.162
We're gonna be here a
little while longer.

56:51.195 --> 56:54.231
Wayne.

56:54.265 --> 56:55.432
What do we do?

56:56.800 --> 56:58.969
Keep your eye on that door.

56:59.003 --> 57:03.507
If Mama wants to stick her
nose out, you shoot it off!

57:04.575 --> 57:05.409
Okay.

57:06.644 --> 57:11.215
You know, Mrs. Kane,
lookin' at this knife,

57:11.248 --> 57:16.187
I'm thinkin' you must stay up
late watching home shopping.

57:17.388 --> 57:19.990
You know, I've seen all
kinds of demonstrations.

57:20.024 --> 57:21.358
Cut through things
that kitchen knives

57:21.392 --> 57:23.861
shouldn't ever have to;

57:23.894 --> 57:26.063
copper pipes, phone books.

57:28.065 --> 57:29.967
- Oh, son of a bitch.
- Oh, I suppose now

57:30.000 --> 57:31.035
- I've got your attention.
- Fuck it.

57:34.338 --> 57:35.738
What you gonna do, rich boy?

57:35.773 --> 57:36.739
Do it again.

57:36.774 --> 57:38.842
You want another.

57:38.876 --> 57:40.544
Goddammit.

57:40.578 --> 57:41.744
Ah, come on.

57:42.947 --> 57:44.882
I can tell you are
your mama's girl.

57:44.915 --> 57:46.951
And you're daddy's
spoiled brat.

57:48.886 --> 57:50.588
Come on, try it one more time.

57:50.621 --> 57:52.523
You think I won't?

57:52.556 --> 57:55.326
Hell, woman, I'm
almost certain you will.

57:55.359 --> 57:58.696
You'd probably open your own
throat just for another shot.

57:58.728 --> 57:59.830
Wouldn't you?

58:02.299 --> 58:03.968
I like you.

58:04.001 --> 58:05.936
You got fight.

58:05.970 --> 58:07.037
Go to hell.

58:08.339 --> 58:11.675
You know I like it
when you mouth off.

58:13.777 --> 58:16.213
Our old man taught us to hunt.

58:18.282 --> 58:21.051
He always made me
clean his kill.

58:22.453 --> 58:26.290
See, you start with a
cut in the lower abdomen,

58:29.560 --> 58:33.597
you go up to the ribcage
and through the stomach,

58:33.631 --> 58:35.032
but not too deep.

58:36.967 --> 58:38.802
No reason to be messy.

58:40.437 --> 58:44.608
Then there's a layer of
fat around the intestines.

58:46.510 --> 58:48.512
You wanna pull that out.

58:49.680 --> 58:52.449
At that point, what
you got is a buck

58:54.018 --> 58:56.353
with guts half in, half out.

59:00.991 --> 59:05.562
All that's left to do is go
up inside the chest cavity,

59:06.765 --> 59:08.265
cut the esophagus.

59:11.335 --> 59:12.269
Pull on it.

59:16.106 --> 59:18.777
That is a simple field dressing.

59:21.345 --> 59:25.616
Of course, I ain't never
done it on a human before.

59:29.820 --> 59:31.088
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

59:31.121 --> 59:34.224
Derrek, ease off the trigger.

59:34.258 --> 59:35.592
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

59:36.460 --> 59:38.028
Pick up her shotgun.

59:38.062 --> 59:39.263
Sorry.

59:39.296 --> 59:41.699
Stop being sorry and
just use your damn head.

59:41.732 --> 59:43.834
Oh, that's good advice.

59:44.902 --> 59:45.703
What this head right here?

59:45.736 --> 59:47.104
Fuck you.

59:47.137 --> 59:48.339
Hey, lady.

59:48.372 --> 59:50.708
If you got any other
ones, send 'em on up!

59:50.741 --> 59:52.309
Y'all let her go.

59:54.144 --> 59:56.246
I got what I want.

59:56.280 --> 59:59.550
What about Derrek and JR, huh?

59:59.583 --> 01:00:00.651
What do they want?

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:02.152
Wayne.

01:00:02.186 --> 01:00:06.791
Keep your damn eye on
her, she's still got guns.

01:00:06.825 --> 01:00:08.225
I want my shot.

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:11.763
I don't care what
happens after that.

01:00:11.796 --> 01:00:13.030
I want my shot.

01:00:15.165 --> 01:00:16.166
All right.

01:00:19.503 --> 01:00:23.407
Okay, I think there's
one more, right?

01:00:24.942 --> 01:00:25.909
There it is.

01:00:29.279 --> 01:00:30.614
Hand it over here, buddy.

01:00:30.647 --> 01:00:33.450
Come out, Derrek
ain't gonna shoot.

01:00:33.484 --> 01:00:35.419
Let me see her first.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.921
All right.

01:00:37.955 --> 01:00:39.456
You wanna see her?

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.035
All right, here she is.

01:01:19.764 --> 01:01:21.165
Let her go.

01:01:21.198 --> 01:01:23.434
Oh, no, I think we're gonna
at least make her watch.

01:01:23.467 --> 01:01:25.536
Isn't that right, Wayne?

01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:27.237
If I have to peel
her eyelids off,

01:01:27.271 --> 01:01:30.007
I'm gonna make her watch
every second of it.

01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:34.378
Too late to save
yourself, Mrs. Kane.

01:01:34.411 --> 01:01:38.081
But it's not too late
to save your daughter.

01:01:39.516 --> 01:01:42.519
Deal don't get any
better than that.

01:01:43.387 --> 01:01:44.221
Mama.

01:01:53.664 --> 01:01:55.332
Oh, I am gonna enjoy this.

01:01:55.365 --> 01:01:57.701
Get ready, little
brother, you're on deck.

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:07.277
Goddammit.

01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:08.880
Goddammit.

01:02:10.815 --> 01:02:12.416
How do you fuck that up Derrek?

01:02:12.449 --> 01:02:13.918
How do you fuck that up?

01:02:53.423 --> 01:02:57.094
If you gonna shoot
me next, make it quick.

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.432
You look good as dead.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:07.204
Ain't no reason to waste
another bullet on you.

01:03:08.438 --> 01:03:11.441
Ain't nothin' left in
me, that ain't tore up.

01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:14.378
Yeah?

01:03:15.947 --> 01:03:18.282
God just has these things.

01:03:20.484 --> 01:03:24.989
I don't think God cares
much for your point of view.

01:03:29.293 --> 01:03:30.460
She get you?

01:03:33.163 --> 01:03:35.732
One thing is for sure,

01:03:35.767 --> 01:03:37.734
I ain't gonna look
pretty after this.

01:03:45.043 --> 01:03:46.209
Well, go on.

01:03:47.912 --> 01:03:49.079
Make it quick.

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:55.485
I don't think I got it in me.

01:03:56.888 --> 01:03:58.555
What about Derrek?

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:01.859
What about Derrek?

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:04.361
You shot him.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:07.564
I did.

01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:17.541
I ain't asking if you
gonna kill me, Wayne.

01:04:17.574 --> 01:04:19.142
I'm telling you to.

01:04:22.245 --> 01:04:24.715
Don't suppose I got
any reason to shoot you,

01:04:24.748 --> 01:04:26.017
little brother.

01:04:29.754 --> 01:04:32.656
If you don't,
that means she did.

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:37.728
Yeah, she did.

01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:43.533
Come on.

01:04:46.503 --> 01:04:48.940
There's a gun in your hand.

01:04:49.874 --> 01:04:50.707
Be a man.

01:04:54.611 --> 01:04:55.445
I can't.

01:04:57.048 --> 01:04:58.783
God won't forgive me.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:05.622
Think killing yourself
is the worst thing

01:05:06.456 --> 01:05:08.392
you have to answer for?

01:05:09.961 --> 01:05:13.865
Think that's the least
of your concerns.

01:05:13.898 --> 01:05:14.698
Please.

01:05:16.533 --> 01:05:17.367
Please.

01:05:21.738 --> 01:05:26.309
You living and dying ain't
got nothing to do with me.

01:05:30.915 --> 01:05:33.417
I don't think I can lift it.

01:05:37.822 --> 01:05:39.957
That's a shame.

01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:47.251
Get the sheriff.

01:07:47.285 --> 01:07:48.753
What are you gonna do?

01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:52.190
You got yourself in this
mess worrying about me.

01:07:52.223 --> 01:07:53.490
Come with me.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.062
Your turn.

01:09:41.032 --> 01:09:42.033
If you able.

01:09:44.135 --> 01:09:49.206
I got... three bullets left.

01:09:51.108 --> 01:09:53.609
You might wanna take the shot.

01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:56.113
One.

01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.984
Two.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.454
Three.

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:13.798
Ready or not, here I come.

01:12:13.784 --> 01:12:15.718
Sheriff, this is Pyle.

01:12:15.753 --> 01:12:20.491
I'm the Kane residence, we,
we got ourselves a situation.

01:12:28.499 --> 01:12:29.834
Got a warrant?
