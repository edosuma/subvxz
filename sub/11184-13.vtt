00:00.968 --> 00:04.643
Respect which cannot be earned
one way must be earned another.

00:07.140 --> 00:11.919
If you touch any of those farmers, I will
personally send you straight to hell.

00:13.213 --> 00:16.285
I have owned them for a thousand years.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.296
String, come on!

01:57.217 --> 02:00.994
We were smart to plant when we did, Dad.
Look at the size of these things.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.000
And the price is up, too.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.093
You're going to be rich, Diem.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.762
We're going to have to learn
to bow when you walk by.

02:07.828 --> 02:12.004
As soon as you harvest, we'll both
be rich. We'll have a bowing contest.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.713
Minh, Minh, what are you doing?

02:15.769 --> 02:17.442
I thought you left an hour ago.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.408
There were a few things to do.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.818
Nonsense. Now, you get yourself
back home and get ready.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.085
You don't spend the day of
your wedding loading trucks.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.955
Are you sure you want to go alone?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.517
Tommy's coming with me.

02:29.583 --> 02:34.498
Besides, when the 2 largest farms stand
up to him, he's finished. No extortions.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.431
No warlord in America.

02:37.357 --> 02:40.236
I'm very proud of my future father-in-law.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.933
Nguyen Van Minh,

02:42.996 --> 02:46.637
you come home right now.
You have to get dressed.

02:46.933 --> 02:49.072
Old woman, have some respect.

02:50.203 --> 02:53.184
I'm going. You embarrass me.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.186
Wait till you see how we
have decorated the house.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.917
It will be a wedding befitting a hero.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.955
And today's report from the Imperial Valley.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.933
The cabbage harvest has been slowed
somewhat by last week's unseasonal rains,

03:09.990 --> 03:12.994
however, damage was minimal due
to advanced meteorological…

03:17.264 --> 03:18.834
in the San Joaquin,

03:18.899 --> 03:20.845
it's expected that last year's fruit fly scare

03:20.901 --> 03:23.541
will not reoccur due to advanced aerial spray.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.683
Good news for artichoke growers…

03:25.739 --> 03:27.343
What's he doing?

03:33.447 --> 03:35.017
…but all news can't be good news.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.843
That smell!

03:56.903 --> 03:58.075
It's gas!

04:38.779 --> 04:40.281
Please, friends.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.120
Some people may be late, but let's begin.

04:45.185 --> 04:48.029
It is good to see you all.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.399
It is good to see so many of the old flags,

04:51.458 --> 04:54.530
to honor a hero of his country's war.

04:55.595 --> 04:59.634
I am honored to give my daughter Mai's hand

04:59.699 --> 05:01.508
to Nguyen Van Minh

05:01.568 --> 05:07.712
and to welcome him to my family
as a son, partner and an heir.

05:19.085 --> 05:22.658
Oh String, a Vietnamese wedding.

05:27.694 --> 05:32.370
You know, I've always found weddings
kind of depressing. How about you, Dom?

05:32.766 --> 05:35.474
Oh, depressing.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.308
Bachelors.

05:48.114 --> 05:50.492
Oh Hawke, she's so beautiful.

05:51.418 --> 05:54.695
You know, there's an old
Vietnamese proverb that says

05:54.754 --> 05:57.735
that a crying woman brings
7 years of bad luck.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.699
You just made that up.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.141
7 years is a long time.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.541
You are now starting your own family.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.782
You have my love and blessing.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.793
All the farmers are falling into line

06:59.853 --> 07:01.992
except for Tru and his new son-in-law, Minh.

07:02.055 --> 07:05.832
Diem ran into a small problem
today. His truck burned up.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.667
That leaves old Tru.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.901
And the new farmer Minh,
it's his wedding today.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.511
Then it's time to pay a little courtesy call.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.615
Go on, give it to 'em now, String.

07:31.318 --> 07:35.266
Please accept a small gesture of our
deep affection for your children.

07:36.222 --> 07:39.260
You are very welcome, Mr. Hawke, and friends.

07:40.593 --> 07:44.666
But this gift is too precious for my
daughter and son-in-law to accept.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.904
Respectfully Mr. Tru, our gift is very modest.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.710
It is more than appropriate.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.720
Not compared to your friendship.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.584
Thank you.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.353
Hey! Congratulations!

08:03.416 --> 08:05.987
- Good luck.
- Thank you for coming.

08:12.559 --> 08:16.336
I am so glad you and your friends
came. It makes the day perfect.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.171
Couldn't miss this.

08:18.231 --> 08:21.178
If it hadn't been for you and
your friends in high places,

08:21.234 --> 08:23.180
I might never have gotten out.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.273
Never known this beautiful place.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.211
Well, you've been a long time

08:27.273 --> 08:28.581
getting over that war, buddy.

08:29.943 --> 08:34.323
But to these people you're a
hero, and that's long overdue.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.225
And I hear you're still making enemies.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.095
What do you mean?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.399
Well, it's what I heard,

08:45.492 --> 08:48.530
that Mai had about a dozen
boyfriends that she sent pack’n.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.834
True.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.569
Well,

08:54.267 --> 08:57.441
you look like you're adjust’n
to your new life just fine.

08:58.304 --> 09:02.275
You'd be surprised how
little some things change.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.064
What is it? What happened?

09:24.364 --> 09:25.707
They killed them.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.702
Diem and Tommy are dead.

09:27.767 --> 09:31.112
- There was an accident.
- It was no accident!

09:31.171 --> 09:34.618
The Sheriff said their truck
overturned and burned.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.621
Minh, why pretend? We all know what happened.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.151
How do you know?

09:40.480 --> 09:45.486
The warlord, Zung. He's been collecting
tributes up and down the valley.

09:45.552 --> 09:48.726
Sama, we'll talk later. It's our concern.

09:51.224 --> 09:56.173
Under the circumstances, no one will
be offended if you wish to go home.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.108
I hope we have not come too late.

10:16.082 --> 10:20.292
A token of respect to those who wish
to preserve our ancient way of life.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.997
Colonel, we are unworthy.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.231
Your gift, it is…

10:26.292 --> 10:29.296
The time for exchange of gifts is over.

10:29.796 --> 10:34.711
I come in friendship, Nguyen
Van Minh, and you dishonor me.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.474
You lying thief!

10:36.536 --> 10:39.142
You kill Tommy and his Father
and then you steal our money.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.240
Sama!

10:40.306 --> 10:42.377
Then you buy expensive gifts to shame us.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.479
Enough of that, boy.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.491
- Sama!
- I'm not afraid of him.

10:57.991 --> 11:01.461
Respect which cannot be earned
one way must be earned another.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.810
Hawke, who was that?

11:07.867 --> 11:09.540
Tranh Van Zung.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.641
He was a Wing Commander
in the Vietnamese Air Force.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.686
If there's anything
we can do to help…

11:25.652 --> 11:27.689
It's not your concern, Hawke.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.139
I have never seen…

12:13.199 --> 12:14.405
A man?

12:15.635 --> 12:17.205
So many scars.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.679
Here, Hawke saved my life.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.582
Here, I saved his.

12:27.513 --> 12:29.186
Here was Tet.

12:31.217 --> 12:32.696
Here…

12:34.988 --> 12:37.992
Here, you have peace.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.785
Hang Nga is the beautiful
princess who lived in the moon,

12:59.812 --> 13:04.522
pale and without flaw, a perfect goddess.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.794
She counted the stars by night

13:07.887 --> 13:12.199
and by day, watched the lives of
the children down on the Earth.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.532
She thought,

13:15.528 --> 13:20.273
“I will send my friend
the white spider on Earth”

13:21.668 --> 13:25.275
“to help the children, to be their friend.”

13:26.072 --> 13:30.612
And so down came the white spider,

13:31.010 --> 13:35.481
on long silver spider webs spun of moonlight,

13:36.716 --> 13:39.356
all the way from the moon to the Earth.

13:41.821 --> 13:46.236
But when the white spider came
near the evil thoughts of men,

13:47.226 --> 13:49.433
a terrible thing happened.

13:50.363 --> 13:54.004
Black he became, black as night,

13:54.434 --> 13:59.042
an evil thing, to chase and devour the
children as he hung from the sky.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.848
"Stop! Stop!" cried the
princess, but it was too late.

14:04.010 --> 14:08.618
And so, until the thoughts
of men are evil no more,

14:10.083 --> 14:13.326
beware the Moon Spider!

16:10.770 --> 16:12.477
Mai.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.575
Have you been out here all night?

16:15.241 --> 16:17.278
Here, you look frozen.

16:18.778 --> 16:22.385
Try not to worry too much. The Doctor
said Minh's gonna be just fine.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.394
You know, we're here to help.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.522
You've got a crop in the
field and it's harvest time.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.725
We'll do anything we can.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.533
It is time to harvest.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.003
But no one will come to help us now.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.506
They're your neighbors. Of course they'll come.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.906
No.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.575
What happened to Minh was not an accident.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.273
You don't understand
what we're up against here.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.149
He is the Guan Cong, the Warlord.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.886
Generations of our people
have paid tribute to him.

16:53.946 --> 16:57.416
He is in our culture, in our stories.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.287
The Moon Spider.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.293
Yes.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.834
The Moon Spider? That story?

17:05.156 --> 17:08.502
It's Zung's trademark, like an insignia.

17:10.329 --> 17:14.141
He uses the old myths to keep
people in line. Pretty clever.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.714
Hey, you guys! Hey!

17:19.372 --> 17:21.352
What are we waiting for?

17:21.440 --> 17:24.887
This field is just waiting
to be picked. Check this out!

17:35.221 --> 17:37.701
You see? Nothing to it.

17:37.823 --> 17:38.824
Yeah, once.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.938
You are most unselfish to help an old man.

17:43.629 --> 17:47.202
Well, you've got a crop in the
field and Minh's in the hospital,

17:48.067 --> 17:50.570
somebody's got to pick it, I guess it's us.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.583
Yeah, but there's no reason we
can't have a little fun, huh?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.643
I'll tell you what.

17:56.108 --> 17:59.817
The first one down to the… down to
that ditch down there is the winner.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.656
You're on.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.487
Okay.

18:03.549 --> 18:04.687
Let's go!

18:06.352 --> 18:08.730
Come on, come on! Faster than that!

18:08.788 --> 18:11.632
Give me a break, I've never cut cabbage before.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.634
Come on. Come on.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.401
You have to move faster
than that. Come on, let's go.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.217
Slow down, Tru. Come on,
we can't catch up with you.

18:32.211 --> 18:36.023
Come on, Dom, let's go, Dom.
That's it, that's it.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.465
Let's go, let's go, move faster.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.469
I won! I won! Hey, I won!

18:55.067 --> 18:57.479
Come on, you slowpokes! I won!

18:59.438 --> 19:01.543
This American Hawke, and his
friends are out there right now,

19:01.607 --> 19:03.917
helping Minh's wife bring in her crops.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.822
Mount this on the left wing

19:07.880 --> 19:10.383
and run a thorough check
on all the other systems.

19:10.449 --> 19:14.454
If we let this go, the people will
say the Spider has lost his bite.

19:15.721 --> 19:20.568
You know, in Vietnam, they
always gave us castoff planes.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.106
And the Americans always had the best.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.903
General, I've seen it happen,

19:24.964 --> 19:27.706
sometimes one hero is all they need.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.937
So what are we confronted with?

19:32.071 --> 19:34.017
One meddling American?

19:35.441 --> 19:40.481
Fortunately, such people have little
stomach for the realities of life.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.185
And of history.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.532
The last time I worked this
hard was at Anzio Beach.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.436
At least we can see the end of it.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.702
Tru owns the other side of the road, too.

19:58.764 --> 19:59.936
What?

20:00.499 --> 20:02.911
Who the hell eats all this stuff, anyway?

20:06.005 --> 20:08.611
Would somebody give me a hand with these?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.226
Can we help you?

20:18.584 --> 20:20.564
Burgess County Sheriff's office.

20:24.156 --> 20:27.968
There were no charges filed in
connection with your husband's injuries,

20:28.027 --> 20:30.007
but I did hear some rumors in town.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.599
Rumors? What kind of rumors?

20:32.665 --> 20:35.612
Someone is trying to shake down
these Vietnamese immigrants.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.738
Sergeant,

20:36.836 --> 20:38.941
unless these people pay
protection, they won't be allowed

20:39.004 --> 20:41.575
to go on their own fields
to harvest their own crop.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.280
Do you know what that means
to a farmer, not to harvest?

20:44.343 --> 20:47.722
I've been a Policeman for 20 years
in this county. I know farmers.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.090
But this is the first I've
heard of protection payoffs.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.459
Where my friends come from,

20:52.518 --> 20:54.088
this is a very old game.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.297
But who's behind it?

20:57.356 --> 20:58.699
Tranh Van Zung.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.972
The man who owns Central Valley Air Service?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.211
When and how did Zung approach you?

21:09.468 --> 21:11.448
Well, not me.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.916
The farmers.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.083
Mr. Tru?

21:20.846 --> 21:23.190
He is not direct.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.320
It is just expected.

21:26.485 --> 21:28.465
The words they use,

21:28.521 --> 21:30.762
I do not think I can translate.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.069
The threat is clear enough.

21:33.125 --> 21:37.005
Either you pay up, or you try to harvest
your crop and they'll kill you.

21:37.363 --> 21:40.207
In a couple of days that crop
will be rotting in the field.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.405
And you're the only one
who can do something about it.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.175
Look, I want to help, really.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.307
I don't want this going on in my county.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.719
But until someone is willing to go on
the record about extortion or assault,

21:49.775 --> 21:51.516
there's not much I can do.

21:53.112 --> 21:54.750
Here's my number.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.885
Day or night, I'll be there.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.862
Show me where your husband was run down.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.835
Something tells me

22:07.893 --> 22:11.136
we could help the Sergeant put
together a little evidence, huh?

22:13.032 --> 22:14.238
Maybe.

22:16.535 --> 22:20.244
That farmer's truck went up,
didn't leave very much, did it?

22:20.673 --> 22:22.675
Well, there's always something.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.955
Peaceful enough now.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.562
What did you find?

22:35.387 --> 22:37.162
Let's see.

22:40.759 --> 22:43.330
Looks like some kind of trigger mechanism.

22:43.395 --> 22:46.205
Yeah, off a grenade. Incendiary, probably.

22:46.332 --> 22:49.040
Oh come on, String, that's ridiculous.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.672
You imagine some guy out here lobbing grenades?

22:51.737 --> 22:53.239
Why, he'd stick out like a…

23:13.092 --> 23:16.539
String, it's gas! Gasoline! Come on!

23:33.212 --> 23:36.455
Hey, these guys are playing for keeps.

23:40.519 --> 23:41.520
Come on.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.468
Hey look, here they come!

23:57.136 --> 23:59.878
Oh, my boy! Are you all right?

24:00.606 --> 24:02.608
He's going to be fine, Father.

24:02.675 --> 24:06.350
All right, all right, Minh's back.
Now things will be different, huh?

24:06.412 --> 24:08.153
Hey, we talked to a cop today, Minh.

24:08.213 --> 24:11.126
He says all he needs is one man
to testify and Zung will be…

24:11.183 --> 24:12.856
Please, I am tired.

24:15.154 --> 24:19.967
All I want to do is say hello to
everyone, and then go lie down.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.061
- Let him alone, Sama.
- No.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.266
He's the only one they'll follow.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.832
He can talk to them.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.373
- He has to lead us.
- No!

24:29.134 --> 24:30.807
I am not your leader.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.480
Let me be.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.711
Hey, I know you!

26:23.615 --> 26:26.027
I'm going to put you in jail, man!

26:31.623 --> 26:33.534
You watch me, hero.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.884
Were he and Minh very close?

27:56.942 --> 27:59.946
Yes, maybe even a distant relative.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.593
Sure seems to be taking it awful hard.

28:03.815 --> 28:08.230
You know him longer than I, you know
what he's like at times like this.

28:08.287 --> 28:11.200
A turtle. Inside himself.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.565
Who knows what he's thinking?

28:15.827 --> 28:17.397
Keep an eye on him.

28:19.898 --> 28:22.174
Damn it. I liked that kid.

28:22.668 --> 28:23.840
So did we.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.706
What's wrong with these people?

28:26.772 --> 28:29.616
Don't they know this is going to keep
going on until somebody speaks out?

28:29.675 --> 28:31.484
Well, where they come from,

28:32.978 --> 28:35.788
the Police and the Warlords
are sometimes the same.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.192
Well I've got a job to do, don't I?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.127
Show them how American cops work.

28:40.185 --> 28:41.994
Maybe this will help.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.230
We found that by what was left of Diem's truck.

28:47.826 --> 28:50.670
Let's go into town, see what the lab says.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.671
You were told to go back to bed and stay there.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.366
I have to go out.

29:59.164 --> 30:01.474
What do they call it in this country?

30:01.533 --> 30:02.841
Macho?

30:03.268 --> 30:07.148
Mai, I am going to bring our crop to market.

30:18.583 --> 30:19.857
Oh, Minh.

30:21.353 --> 30:25.358
Minh, how long has it been since
Hawke sponsored you to this country?

30:25.590 --> 30:27.399
The day you arrived, you kissed the ground

30:27.459 --> 30:29.598
and swore you'd never use a weapon again.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.771
Sama put his trust in me. I failed him.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.180
I let him die just because

30:40.639 --> 30:42.778
I was tired of fighting.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.616
They'll kill you, too.

30:44.976 --> 30:47.650
If I don't go, I'm already dead.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.059
I'll go with you.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.660
You remind everyone that this is America.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.728
Here women have equal rights.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.836
In all things,

31:12.104 --> 31:13.515
except this.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.462
Mr. Zung,

32:12.197 --> 32:13.733
I'd like to have a word with you.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.445
Mr. Hawke, Mr. Santini.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.382
Please, join me in a drink.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.818
Why not?

32:32.184 --> 32:35.461
String! You're not gonna drink
with this hood, are you?

32:39.057 --> 32:40.559
Your friend speaks harshly of me.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.098
I know you, bloodsucker.

32:45.163 --> 32:48.576
And so did my Father,
and his Father before him.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.439
You got a name in every language.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.916
Cosa Nostra, La Mano Neva.

32:55.273 --> 32:57.776
And in your country, Guan Cong.

33:03.114 --> 33:07.563
Explain to your friend that I
simply receive voluntary tribute.

33:08.019 --> 33:10.829
And if you don't choose to volunteer?

33:18.029 --> 33:19.975
Do you mean, for example,

33:20.632 --> 33:24.136
a farmer trying to take a
truckload of lettuce to market?

33:24.202 --> 33:26.944
Zung, you slaughtered the Diem family.

33:27.939 --> 33:31.352
You murdered Sama. That's for the police.

33:31.910 --> 33:35.949
But if you touch Minh, his family,

33:36.014 --> 33:37.721
or any of those farmers,

33:38.884 --> 33:43.299
I will personally send you straight to hell.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.226
Americans.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.901
You understand heroics,
but never inevitability.

33:52.330 --> 33:53.866
I understand

33:54.633 --> 33:56.510
much more than you think.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.423
Deal with Minh.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.295
Hey, what's he mean by "inevitability"?

34:14.753 --> 34:17.199
That radio call said Minh's
bringing in his crops.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.632
Means they'll hit him with gasoline.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.703
We'd better get out there, fast.

35:32.897 --> 35:34.433
Halfway there.

35:34.499 --> 35:36.342
Maybe we're going to make it.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.044
Of course we are.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.649
You haven't lived all these years

35:40.739 --> 35:43.049
to be stopped 10 miles out of town.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.528
Come! Gas!

36:40.498 --> 36:41.499
This way.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.684
What's that?

36:47.739 --> 36:50.049
That's our answer to the Black Spider.

37:17.135 --> 37:22.016
This is Stringfellow Hawke on Police
Frequency 9 for Sergeant Bryant.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.232
Well, let's just hope this works.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.169
This garbage belongs to you.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.470
They just don't make thugs
the way they used to.

37:51.536 --> 37:53.573
You're finished, Zung.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.716
And what brings you to that calculation?

37:56.775 --> 38:00.348
He's going to tell the
police all about your operation.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.918
He'd be very foolish to do so.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.862
You know, your friends may think I've lost.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.424
But you Minh, you know better.

38:13.358 --> 38:16.896
You've got one prisoner,
I've got all the people.

38:16.961 --> 38:20.408
And I have owned them for a thousand years.

38:34.445 --> 38:36.652
He's right. I've changed nothing.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.251
What's the first thing you learned in combat?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.923
You don't do anything all by yourself.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.868
So now we know.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.538
There is no mystery anymore.

38:54.699 --> 38:57.407
We know how Diem and Tommy were killed.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.617
My friend Hawke thinks

39:01.906 --> 39:04.910
the Police will be able to
put this killer in jail.

39:05.109 --> 39:08.818
But we are behind bars, too.
Bars of our own making.

39:10.048 --> 39:15.020
Here we are, in America, with
farms and cars and mortgages,

39:15.086 --> 39:17.657
and our children growing up as Americans,

39:17.722 --> 39:20.100
and still, even now,

39:20.358 --> 39:23.828
Zung has his way with us. It is not right!

39:26.264 --> 39:28.039
Zung said to me,

39:28.867 --> 39:32.144
"I have owned them for a thousand years."

39:33.638 --> 39:37.814
I did not come to this country
to be owned by anyone!

39:39.611 --> 39:42.922
I do not come here to be your leader.

39:43.348 --> 39:48.058
But before I become owned again, I will lead!

39:49.888 --> 39:55.099
Tomorrow, into the fields
to bring in the harvest.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.674
And not one cent of tribute.

39:59.564 --> 40:01.544
Who will work beside me?

43:14.425 --> 43:15.802
Come on. Come on!

43:27.772 --> 43:29.752
Hey String, while we're chasing this one,

43:29.807 --> 43:31.787
the other guy's lining up for a gasoline run.

44:03.107 --> 44:04.415
Hawke.

44:09.914 --> 44:12.451
Nice machine you have there, Mr. Hawke.

44:12.517 --> 44:15.327
But it is not the machine
that gives you the edge.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.294
It's the man.

44:49.554 --> 44:52.364
He's coming straight at us. Kamikaze run.

45:22.820 --> 45:25.357
Grandmother, the Spider, he's coming for us.

45:34.599 --> 45:37.079
You, you, you, gather the chute.

45:40.171 --> 45:41.445
Now!

45:45.042 --> 45:47.921
String, I sure hope they
don't knuckle under again.

45:47.979 --> 45:50.983
Well, we can't do any more.
They're on their own now.

45:55.486 --> 45:58.399
Right now, I said! Gather the chute!

45:59.323 --> 46:00.996
Did you hear me?

46:14.105 --> 46:17.382
Tranh Van Zung, you are under arrest.

46:17.675 --> 46:19.154
By whose authority?

46:19.210 --> 46:20.450
My own.

46:22.446 --> 46:25.757
This is America! Citizen's arrest!

47:03.788 --> 47:08.259
“...for being true friends, and for
giving us the finest gift of all,”

47:08.326 --> 47:09.600
“freedom.”

47:09.660 --> 47:11.765
That's nice.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.638
Think they're gonna make it, Hawke?

47:14.098 --> 47:15.600
I think they already have.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.339
Hey, what are we gonna
do with all this stuff?

47:17.401 --> 47:21.076
Eat it. You know it always tastes
better when you pick it yourself.

47:21.572 --> 47:25.384
Look at this. Hey, they sent us a souvenir.

47:27.945 --> 47:29.288
Suitable for framing.
