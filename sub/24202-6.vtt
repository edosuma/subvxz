those two, you wouldn't believe it.

01:58.304 --> 02:00.961
Yeah. Mason watches
"Project Runway." Still!

02:00.967 --> 02:03.766

Okay, I don't care about
Mason or... Pandoro.

02:07.449 --> 02:09.657
I like musicals, so
I tried out for one.

02:10.554 --> 02:11.936
And I got the lead.

02:11.942 --> 02:15.443
- Ooh!

Honey, I just don't understand

02:51.468 --> 02:53.134
why you thought you had
to hide this from us.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.173
- We're your number-one fans.
- Go, Mae!

02:55.179 --> 02:57.368
Honestly, it's because I
didn't want to deal with this.

02:57.374 --> 02:59.474
- What, us?
- You guys act more like a couple

02:59.480 --> 03:02.079
now that you aren't
one. I find it abnormal.

03:02.479 --> 03:04.404
And Rydakto agrees with me.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.993
Rydakto? What's Rydakto?
Is that a cartoon?

03:05.999 --> 03:08.587
Is that a drug? Should I
ask my doctor about Rydakto?

03:08.593 --> 03:10.993
- Yo, hook me up with some Rydakto.
- I'll get you some Rydakto.

03:10.999 --> 03:13.493
Dr. Rydakto is the
school psychiatrist.

03:13.499 --> 03:15.372
I've been seeing him
during lunch periods.

03:15.473 --> 03:18.473
He's easy to talk to, and
he's really, really cool.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.778
Mae feels comfortable
confiding in me

03:20.784 --> 03:22.467
because I'm easy to talk to

03:23.307 --> 03:25.041
and I'm really, really cool.

03:28.010 --> 03:29.808
Mae agreed that it
would be beneficial

03:29.814 --> 03:32.039
for me to share her
feelings with you.

03:32.315 --> 03:33.643
- Great.
- So...

03:33.649 --> 03:36.165
- What's that? Okay.
- Like that.

03:36.171 --> 03:38.337
Um... here it is.

03:38.841 --> 03:41.462
You're not acting divorced.

03:41.577 --> 03:44.439
Would it be better for the
kids if we hated each other?

03:44.445 --> 03:47.959
Better, no. Uh,
more comprehensible?

03:49.962 --> 03:51.704
Yes?

03:52.574 --> 03:53.807
No.

03:53.978 --> 03:55.178
It's no.

03:55.453 --> 03:57.386
- It's yes.
- Yes.

03:57.392 --> 03:59.282
- If it were "no," then it would be the same
- He w... he was nodding his head.

03:59.288 --> 04:01.077
- as being friends.
- Yeah, but he was nodding his head. When he...

04:01.083 --> 04:02.617
Keeps nodding... Yes, I
keep nodding my head.

04:02.623 --> 04:03.911
It's part of my process.

04:03.917 --> 04:06.708
When the both of you
insist on doing things

04:06.714 --> 04:10.827
"like a couple," Mae finds
it to be disingenuous.

04:10.833 --> 04:14.474
Confusing. And, uh...
her words, not mine...

04:15.450 --> 04:16.733
"gross."

04:16.945 --> 04:21.064
For example, she'd rather you not
attend her performance together.

04:21.577 --> 04:23.775
She'd rather the
night be about the work

04:23.781 --> 04:26.015
and not about how not divorced

04:26.312 --> 04:28.720
- the two of you want to act.
- We act very divorced.

04:28.726 --> 04:32.527
Has either party considered
getting a place of their own?

04:32.616 --> 04:33.931
I...

04:33.937 --> 04:36.952
I feel like we're
in trouble here.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.852
Yeah, well I feel like we're
about to get some demerits.

04:39.858 --> 04:41.952
Because we're,
like, awful parents.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.468
That's not for me to say.

04:44.741 --> 04:49.170
But you could try establishing some
clear boundaries with each other.

04:49.474 --> 04:51.384
Okay, fine.

04:52.277 --> 04:55.000
- Uh, Martin... this is your week,
- Yes.

04:55.006 --> 04:58.552
so why don't you go see
Mae's performance by yourself?

04:58.558 --> 05:00.132
And I'll just sit this one out.

05:00.138 --> 05:01.488
Now we're using our heads.

05:01.494 --> 05:04.232
No, we're not. That
was an empty offer,

05:04.238 --> 05:08.013
okay? That... I've never missed
a first of any of our children...

05:08.019 --> 05:10.463
- so that would be the first missing of a first.
- Shh.

05:10.469 --> 05:11.669
Look.

05:12.362 --> 05:13.791
I'm no expert...

05:14.377 --> 05:17.182
well, except that I am.

05:17.346 --> 05:20.002
So I'm gonna give you the
best advice that I can...

05:20.008 --> 05:22.103
stop acting like a couple.

05:22.109 --> 05:23.597
It's for everyone's good.

05:23.603 --> 05:25.005
And maybe you can
use this time to

05:25.011 --> 05:27.829
focus on where you're
going as individuals...

05:27.835 --> 05:29.249
individually.

05:32.011 --> 05:33.987
- I like that.
- Okay.

05:36.188 --> 05:37.818
Martin, I've got your keys.

05:39.269 --> 05:41.658
That's just being
neighborly. I...

05:42.547 --> 05:45.495
No, you know what?
I get it. I get it.

05:47.399 --> 05:50.510
Antiquing, huh? I
must really like you.

05:52.327 --> 05:54.345
You should get that jacket.

05:54.431 --> 05:57.728
- Oh, I think that was my jacket.
- Really?

05:57.734 --> 06:00.439
- It's vintage.
- Well, then, the math works.

06:00.445 --> 06:01.805
- Ah-ha-ha.
- Ah...

06:01.811 --> 06:04.439
Oh, she likes the
"old-man" jokes.

06:04.445 --> 06:06.681
When they're coming from
an authentic old man? Yeah,

06:06.687 --> 06:08.431
- I-I do.
- Mm-hmm.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.257
- Martin.
- Hmm?

06:16.350 --> 06:17.665
You need this.

06:17.671 --> 06:19.954
- The key to the city?
- It's a key hook.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.341
What for?

06:21.675 --> 06:23.464
You never know
where your keys are.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.801
Oh, come on. Whoever really
knows where their keys are?

06:29.254 --> 06:30.793
I'm buying it for you.

Who gives someone a hook?

06:46.900 --> 06:48.353
What are you doing?

06:48.359 --> 06:51.033
A hook is very presumptuous.
Don't you guys think?

06:51.039 --> 06:52.771
What are you rambling about?

06:53.611 --> 06:55.433
Never mind. Okay,
we're out the door.

06:55.439 --> 06:57.425
Everyone have their
backpacks? Lunches?

06:57.431 --> 07:00.078
- Did anyone feed Josh?
- That thing's still alive?

07:00.084 --> 07:02.153
"That thing," as in the
turtle you begged for?

07:02.159 --> 07:04.846
Yes, Josh is still alive,
and he's gonna outlive me,

07:04.852 --> 07:06.750
so you better show him
a little bit of respect.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.804
Martin?

07:39.266 --> 07:40.986
Really?

07:46.673 --> 07:50.123
I beg your pardon.

07:55.724 --> 07:57.640
Hey.

07:57.646 --> 07:59.399
Is that better for ya, Josh?

07:59.405 --> 08:00.938
A little more central?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.018
Why do you look so depressed?

08:05.024 --> 08:07.000
Hey. You gonna wear the shirt
I got you to school tomorrow?

08:07.006 --> 08:09.737
Are you kidding? I'm saving
that baby for a special occasion.

08:11.509 --> 08:13.034
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:14.859 --> 08:16.277
Hey.

08:16.283 --> 08:18.560
Ah, okay.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.864
Okay.

08:20.043 --> 08:22.076
- Is that true?
- Is what true?

08:22.082 --> 08:25.271
Are you saving that shirt
for a special occasion?

08:25.277 --> 08:27.331
Oh. No, I hate it.

08:27.337 --> 08:30.014
It says "Nama-stay In
Bed" and it's sleeveless.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.220
Wow.

08:31.908 --> 08:33.841
You handled that like a pro.

08:35.111 --> 08:38.876
Hey, you think it'd be weird if
I asked you for some girl advice?

08:38.881 --> 08:40.690
Very. Proceed.

08:44.092 --> 08:45.427
Okay.

08:45.798 --> 08:47.972
Well, yesterday my bird
tried to move things

08:47.978 --> 08:50.229
to the "key hook" stage,
if you know what I mean.

08:50.235 --> 08:51.520
I-I don't.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.088
I just... I feel like
she's overstepping,

08:54.094 --> 08:55.894
and I kinda wanna
hit the brakes.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.104
So, what should I do?

08:59.572 --> 09:01.025
Ghost her?

09:01.400 --> 09:04.314
Ghost her? What
does that even mean?

09:04.320 --> 09:07.915
I think it means you're dead
to her or... she's dead to you?

09:07.921 --> 09:10.634
Uh, basically, it just means
you stop replying to her texts.

09:10.707 --> 09:13.011
But be forewarned...

09:13.017 --> 09:15.574
once you ghost, it can
be very hard to un-ghost.

09:15.738 --> 09:18.658
- Is that right?
- I mean, from what I hear.

09:18.664 --> 09:20.451
I've never personally
ghosted, but

09:20.457 --> 09:22.569
I've been the ghostee
and it's chilling.

09:22.575 --> 09:25.130
Right. Ghosting seems
a little immature.

09:25.136 --> 09:26.500
Course it is, I'm 14.

09:26.506 --> 09:27.921
Here, give me your phone.

09:32.301 --> 09:34.194
Uh, don't... don't
go to the pictures.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.400
Okay.

09:36.300 --> 09:40.178
Dad, she texted "hey" four hours
ago and you still haven't responded?

09:40.184 --> 09:42.402
So, uh, w-what does that mean?

09:42.408 --> 09:44.989
It means you're already
ghosting. You're mid-ghost.

09:44.995 --> 09:46.195
What?!

09:49.577 --> 09:51.360
Who buys home furnishings

09:51.366 --> 09:53.563
- for someone else's home?
- What?

09:53.569 --> 09:57.389
Someone installed a new
key hook in the foyer.

09:57.647 --> 10:01.897
Whoa. I can't believe that
Page Six missed that scoop.

10:01.903 --> 10:03.811
It was Lisa Apple.
I'm sure of it.

10:03.817 --> 10:05.812
She is marking her territory.

10:05.927 --> 10:09.116
She just sprayed her
scent all over my entryway,

10:09.122 --> 10:10.811
- like a feral cat.
- Wow.

10:10.817 --> 10:13.658
If you don't want Martin's
girlfriend in your house,

10:13.664 --> 10:16.457
maybe you two need to discuss
the boundaries beyond the kids,

10:16.463 --> 10:20.957
because Lisa can be
a little presumptuous.

10:20.963 --> 10:23.352
Wait. She can?

10:23.743 --> 10:25.443
How well do you know Lisa?

10:25.629 --> 10:29.238
I... might've friended
her on Facebook.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.835
After we had dinner.

10:32.226 --> 10:33.467
And dessert.

10:33.746 --> 10:35.264
At a different location.

10:35.270 --> 10:38.163
You went to multiple locations
with Martin's new girlfriend?

10:38.169 --> 10:39.841
I'm sorry, okay?

10:39.847 --> 10:42.951
Uh... Martin invited us to go
out to dinner with them, and...

10:42.957 --> 10:44.574
I didn't know what
the rules were.

10:44.580 --> 10:48.350
She just sprayed her
scent all over you, too.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.640
Do you want me to de-friend
her? Because I will.

10:51.646 --> 10:53.249
I will drop a bitch
just like that.

10:53.255 --> 10:55.070
- I've done it before.
- Do whatever you want.

10:55.076 --> 10:57.134
Friend her, face-swap her,

10:57.140 --> 10:59.650
make her your Woman Crush
Wednesday, I don't care.

10:59.656 --> 11:00.856
Lena...

11:01.167 --> 11:05.770
I have wanted for you and Martin
to get back together for so long.

11:05.776 --> 11:09.417
But I have to admit, Martin
just seems better now.

11:09.423 --> 11:13.026
It's like before, he had this giant
chip on his shoulder all the time.

11:13.032 --> 11:15.636
- And I was the chip?
- I'm not saying that.

11:15.642 --> 11:18.447
I'm just saying that
Martin has moved on.

11:18.938 --> 11:22.016
And more importantly,
I've moved on.

11:23.931 --> 11:26.237
I hope you can move on, too.

11:27.850 --> 11:30.611
It's like... I'm
no longer a wife.

11:30.617 --> 11:33.078
I can't throw myself into
taking care of the kids

11:33.084 --> 11:35.093
unless it happens to be my week.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.078
Everybody's ready
for me to move on,

11:37.084 --> 11:39.289
but I don't know what I'm
supposed to move on to.

11:39.377 --> 11:42.201
Another man? A new relationship?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.190
I just... I don't think
I'm ready for that.

11:46.086 --> 11:47.414
But it's just weird

11:47.420 --> 11:50.598
when everyone in the world is
"partnered off" except for us.

11:51.081 --> 11:52.816
I actually have a girlfriend.

11:53.101 --> 11:55.994
It's my nanny, Blanca.
It's pretty serious.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.306
We've been together
since I was born.

11:58.973 --> 12:00.173
Hmm.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.978
Wow. Yours is really good.

12:01.984 --> 12:04.104
Hey, thanks.

12:04.964 --> 12:08.899
You know, I used to
love going to see art...

12:08.905 --> 12:10.487
like real art...

12:10.493 --> 12:13.415
but Martin didn't like going, so...

12:13.421 --> 12:15.329
- I stopped. I guess...
- _

12:15.335 --> 12:19.530
I have to start taking myself
to the places I wanna go.

12:20.232 --> 12:22.909
Yeah, or get a Blanca.

12:24.718 --> 12:29.906

forgot it was you up there.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.616
I am so proud of you, kiddo.

13:00.622 --> 13:01.852
Thanks, Dad.

13:01.858 --> 13:03.832
Um, everyone's going to
Fro-Yo Life to celebrate.

13:03.838 --> 13:05.499
Can I go? Rebecca's
mom will drive me home.

13:05.505 --> 13:06.705
Of course.

13:06.706 --> 13:07.906
He said yes!

13:07.912 --> 13:09.112
Have fun.

13:09.945 --> 13:12.268
Martin. Hi!

13:12.274 --> 13:14.121
- Hey.
- Mae was great.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.859
Thanks. So was... yours.

13:18.929 --> 13:21.627
- No Lena tonight?
- No Lena tonight.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.758
And you came alone? I
heard you were dating.

13:25.133 --> 13:26.547
Dr. R?

13:27.539 --> 13:29.853

13:53.053 --> 13:54.411
Wes!

13:54.578 --> 13:56.689
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

13:56.695 --> 13:58.752
Oh. Oh.

13:59.180 --> 14:02.390
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Yeah, me too.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.924
I'm surprised I never
heard back from you.

14:04.930 --> 14:07.455
Oh, yeah, I-I
thought about calling.

14:07.461 --> 14:10.129
I wanted to call.
Um... we just...

14:10.135 --> 14:12.136
- we jumped in so fast, and I...
- Yeah.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.678
I realized I have a bunch of
stuff I needed to figure out.

14:15.684 --> 14:18.293
Did you... figure it out?

14:18.371 --> 14:22.168
- Um... in the process.
- Yeah?

14:22.559 --> 14:26.243
I'm... I'm trying to train
myself to be more like her.

14:26.249 --> 14:29.136
I want to rise above
what's been weighing me down

14:29.142 --> 14:33.058
- and embark on a cosmic journey.
- Mm, in a unitard.

14:33.196 --> 14:35.644
In a unitard, yeah.

14:38.629 --> 14:41.129
I just don't want
you to blame yourself,

14:41.135 --> 14:43.529
okay? It had nothing to do with

14:43.535 --> 14:45.611
- you...
- I found you.

14:47.104 --> 14:50.848
Um, Lena, this is my
girlfriend, Meegan.

14:50.854 --> 14:54.061
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello, hi.

14:54.067 --> 14:57.261
Um... oh, my gosh.
Congratulations.

14:57.267 --> 14:58.950
- Ah!
- Wow.

14:58.956 --> 15:01.382
- You got a good one there.
- I know, right?

15:01.928 --> 15:03.187
How do you two know each other?

15:03.193 --> 15:04.805
Wait, let me guess. I'm
really good at guessing.

15:04.811 --> 15:07.484
- Um, babe...
- You delivered Wes.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.019
- Are you the doctor that delivered Wes?
- No.

15:10.804 --> 15:13.207
You're his aunt.
Is she the gay aunt?

15:13.213 --> 15:14.413
No.

15:15.195 --> 15:17.302
Your face is triggering me.

15:18.007 --> 15:21.211
- You work at the deli on his corner.
- Yes. Yes.

15:21.710 --> 15:25.028
I work at the neighborhood
deli. I'm his deli lady.

15:25.034 --> 15:26.723
Oh, my God. I'm so good, right?

15:26.729 --> 15:29.338
- Yes.
- Ah, I'm so good! What do I win, baby?

15:29.344 --> 15:31.434
Are you gonna buy me every
painting in this gallery?

15:31.526 --> 15:33.418
- 'Cause I'm obsessed.
- Me too.

15:33.424 --> 15:35.442
- I'm obsessed.
- Uh-huh.

15:36.054 --> 15:37.918
It's great to meet you, Meegan,

15:37.924 --> 15:39.953
and good to see you again, Wes.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.742
Um... don't forget...

15:42.748 --> 15:46.051
we're gonna have a
sale on ham next week.

15:46.057 --> 15:47.576
I've been trying to
cut back on sodium,

15:47.582 --> 15:49.482
- but, um... Thanks.
- Yes, right, I remember that.

15:49.488 --> 15:50.846
Yeah, of course.

15:54.664 --> 15:56.545
You know, we're
thinking of offering

15:56.551 --> 15:58.987
a low-sodium variety
in the future,

15:59.194 --> 16:00.571
so...

16:00.875 --> 16:02.951
Just in case you
want to check back in.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.750
Yeah, maybe I will.

16:08.647 --> 16:11.958
That deli lady is really
concerned about your ham.

16:13.809 --> 16:15.009
Mm-hmm.

16:15.834 --> 16:18.953
Your apprehensions
are less about Lisa

16:18.959 --> 16:22.443
and more about Martin and
his relationship anxiety.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.626
It's not just the Lisa thing.

16:27.632 --> 16:29.922
I'm also having
anxiety about Josh.

16:30.094 --> 16:31.408
Josh?

16:31.414 --> 16:32.708
Our turtle.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.682
I am haunted by his
little green face.

16:38.471 --> 16:40.088
It keeps me up at night,

16:40.874 --> 16:43.884
the thought of him
trapped in a box.

16:44.072 --> 16:45.964
He needs to move on,

16:45.970 --> 16:49.105
explore new options, feel
the sunshine on his shell.

16:50.617 --> 16:52.717
A little grass between his toes.

16:53.825 --> 16:58.310
Well, it sounds like you're
projecting your own feelings onto Josh.

16:58.482 --> 16:59.973
It's all connected.

17:00.496 --> 17:04.779
Locate your inner turtle,
Martin, okay? Just find it.

17:05.991 --> 17:08.819
So... I can see him.

17:09.612 --> 17:10.973
Now...

17:11.771 --> 17:13.215
set him free.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.527
Free him.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.598
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

17:21.714 --> 17:23.608
I can't tell you
how refreshing it is

17:23.615 --> 17:26.397
to talk to someone with
fully-formed adult neurosis.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.316
Thank you.

17:38.864 --> 17:41.699
Mae! Hey, how did it go?

17:41.778 --> 17:44.874
The "Juniper Street Gazette" say
I might get nominated for a Juni.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.585
Who even knew there
was such a thing,

17:46.591 --> 17:48.575
and now you might
get nominated for one!

17:49.161 --> 17:53.427
Mom, I just wanted to say
thanks for n-not coming.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.813
I know it was
probably hard for you.

17:54.819 --> 17:56.069
Oh. Pfft.

17:56.206 --> 17:58.818
It was. I wanted to
respect your feelings,

17:58.824 --> 18:00.724
but I also wanted to
totally ignore them.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.144
I went with the former.

18:03.613 --> 18:05.437
I also pre-ordered the DVD.

18:05.726 --> 18:06.954
Of course you did.

18:11.093 --> 18:13.696
I'm really sorry
if it's confusing

18:13.702 --> 18:15.517
that Dad and I don't
hate each other.

18:15.523 --> 18:18.638
It's just you guys are
getting along better than ever,

18:18.644 --> 18:22.037
and we all basically
live in the same house.

18:22.340 --> 18:24.645
So why do you even
need to be divorced?

18:26.129 --> 18:27.559
Because...

18:28.722 --> 18:32.253
I don't want to be married to
someone who can live with me.

18:33.845 --> 18:37.246
I want to be married to someone
who can't live without me.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.230
Did you write that
down in advance?

18:42.236 --> 18:44.136
No. I swear.

18:44.142 --> 18:46.322
It just came out perfect now.

18:50.845 --> 18:52.425
Is that supposed to be you?

18:52.970 --> 18:57.168
It's supposed to be, but
I'm not sure it is yet.

18:59.266 --> 19:00.694
Can I have it when you die?

19:00.700 --> 19:01.900
Yeah.

19:02.068 --> 19:03.674
But don't get your hopes up.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.765
I plan on living as long as...

19:06.563 --> 19:08.797
Hey, where's Josh?

19:10.569 --> 19:12.280
I know it's hard, Josh.

19:12.959 --> 19:16.094
I know it's hard to leave the
only home that you've ever known.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.277
But it's time to take the leap.

19:21.014 --> 19:22.847
Be free, Josh!

19:22.996 --> 19:24.229
Run!

19:24.330 --> 19:25.722
Be free!

19:25.728 --> 19:26.928
Martin?

19:27.549 --> 19:30.636
Lisa, thank you for
meeting me out here.

19:31.181 --> 19:34.334
Look, I'm sorry I ghosted
you. It was Mason's idea.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.305
What? When did you ghost me?

19:37.508 --> 19:39.125
Maybe I didn't do it right.

19:39.898 --> 19:41.717
Anyway, the point is, is...

19:42.828 --> 19:44.416
I was scared.

19:44.422 --> 19:47.747
Martin, I'm happy to take
things as slow as you want.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.573
No, I don't want, okay?

19:50.737 --> 19:52.411
I found this really
great therapist

19:52.417 --> 19:55.130
that I'm gonna start seeing
during 7th period on Thursdays.

19:55.136 --> 19:57.354
- Oh.
- And if you're open to it,

19:57.925 --> 20:00.834
I am ready to take the leap.

20:06.762 --> 20:09.035
_

20:15.474 --> 20:17.389
I've made peace with where I am.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.888
I'm gonna make like
the woman in my painting

20:19.894 --> 20:22.122
and allow the darkness
to be the stepping stones

20:22.128 --> 20:24.425
that carry me toward
a brighter tomorrow.

20:24.510 --> 20:26.433
What are you talking about?

20:26.439 --> 20:28.536
Are those Gloria Estefan lyrics?

20:28.542 --> 20:29.746
I'm just saying.

20:29.806 --> 20:31.939
I've been immature
about Lisa Apple.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.121
You should hang out with
her as much as you want.

20:34.222 --> 20:36.779
I'm sure she has great traits.

20:36.785 --> 20:39.316
Maybe the three of us could
get dinner together sometime.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.197
Are you (BLEEP) kidding me?

20:50.532 --> 20:52.565
Oh, no.

20:52.912 --> 20:55.853
I'm sorry. I guess
my bag was too heavy.

20:56.044 --> 20:57.568
What was in it?

20:57.630 --> 21:00.648
Oh, you know, wallet,
makeup, hand weights,

21:00.654 --> 21:04.195
couple of bricks I stole from
the construction site next door.

21:04.773 --> 21:06.650
You are a really good friend.

21:06.656 --> 21:11.236
Well, you know, chicks
before... younger chicks.

21:11.242 --> 21:12.442
Yeah.

21:12.857 --> 21:14.057
Come here.

21:16.646 --> 21:18.250
How badly do you
want to clean that

21:18.256 --> 21:20.595
- mess up? Okay, go ahead.
- So badly.
