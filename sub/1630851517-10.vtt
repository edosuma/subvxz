00:01.701 --> 00:03.235
<i>Previously on</i>
Young Sheldon...

00:03.303 --> 00:05.605
So, there's a secret

00:05.672 --> 00:06.639
back room
at the laundromat

00:06.705 --> 00:08.375
<i>where you gamble?</i>

00:08.441 --> 00:09.642
Yeah. (chuckles)

00:09.709 --> 00:11.010
And you never told me?

00:11.077 --> 00:12.612
Well, this is how
secrets work.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.514
The cops shut me down.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.648
Let's get this going again.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.183
(machines chiming)

00:18.685 --> 00:21.287
{\an5}What a haul, huh?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.287
Now what happens?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.656
I take it home,
pour it on the bed,

00:23.723 --> 00:26.126
and just roll around in it.
(chuckles)

00:29.162 --> 00:31.164
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>From grade school</i>
<i>to high school,</i>

00:31.231 --> 00:32.432
<i>every moment of the day</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:34.434
{\an5}<i>is accounted for.</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:34.434
(bells ringing)

00:34.501 --> 00:35.769
<i>From the morning bell</i>
<i>to dismissal,</i>

00:35.835 --> 00:37.470
<i>you knew where</i>
<i>you were supposed to be,</i>

00:37.537 --> 00:39.038
<i>what you were</i>
<i>going to be learning,</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:40.673
<i>and which poor excuse</i>
<i>for a teacher</i>

00:40.740 --> 00:42.175
{\an5}<i>you would have to correct.</i>

00:40.740 --> 00:42.175
Ms. Ingram,

00:42.242 --> 00:43.443
can I offer a suggestion?

00:43.510 --> 00:46.179
{\an4}What?

00:43.510 --> 00:46.179
Never mind. You do it your way.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.247
Yes, Sheldon?

00:47.313 --> 00:49.048
{\an1}I don't find that
interesting.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.417
Cooper? (sighs)

00:50.483 --> 00:51.684
If you're going to ask us
to run,

00:51.751 --> 00:54.487
don't you think you should
lead by example?

00:56.222 --> 00:57.724
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>None of this prepared me</i>

00:57.791 --> 01:00.693
<i>for the gap-filled,</i>
<i>Swiss cheese anarchy</i>

01:00.760 --> 01:02.729
<i>of a college schedule.</i>
<i>Look at these poor saps.</i>

01:02.796 --> 01:06.533
<i>Desperately trying to occupy</i>
<i>their time until the next class.</i>

01:09.636 --> 01:11.704
{\an1}SHELDON:
I smell your perfume.

01:13.139 --> 01:16.476
{\an8}So, what, pray tell,
is today's problem?

01:16.543 --> 01:18.445
{\an8}I have a four-hour gap
in my schedule.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.113
{\an8}How is that a problem?

01:20.180 --> 01:22.282
{\an8}According to the
Oxford English Dictionary,

01:22.348 --> 01:24.784
{\an8}it's a matter or situation
regarded as unwelcome

01:24.851 --> 01:27.487
{\an8}or harmful and needing
to be dealt with and overcome.

01:27.554 --> 01:30.123
{\an8}Fine, go hang out
in the cafeteria.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.124
{\an8}I don't "hang."

01:31.191 --> 01:32.358
{\an8}Go to the library.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.194
{\an8}Too noisy.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.162
{\an8}Take a nap. Kids love those.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.263
{\an8}In a public place?

01:37.330 --> 01:39.098
{\an8}I'm sorry, is this Woodstock?

01:39.165 --> 01:41.634
{\an8}Sheldon, I'm not the one
who made your schedule.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.636
{\an8}No, but as the president
of the university,

01:43.703 --> 01:45.772
{\an8}you do have the power
to adjust the class times.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.674
{\an8}So, you expect me

01:47.740 --> 01:49.242
{\an8}to disrupt the schedule

01:49.309 --> 01:52.178
{\an8}of hundreds of students
for your convenience?

01:52.245 --> 01:53.580
{\an8}Finally, we're on the same page.

01:53.646 --> 01:55.215
{\an8}Sheldon, I have work to do,

01:55.281 --> 01:56.816
{\an8}and I'm sure that you can
solve this one on your own.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.552
I suppose a nap
might be refreshing.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.588
What kind of lumbar support
does that couch have?

02:01.654 --> 02:03.756
That's it. Come with me.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.126
Here we are.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.428
(chuckles)

02:08.495 --> 02:09.562
What is this?

02:09.628 --> 02:12.232
A dorm room, and it's all yours.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.134
{\an3}You can study, take naps,
do whatever you want.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.402
No one's living here?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.438
{\an3}Well, we had an Indian
exchange student,

02:18.505 --> 02:20.540
{\an3}but he developed a taste
for barbecue,

02:20.607 --> 02:22.675
{\an3}so his parents
made him go home.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.344
Well, thank you for this.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.379
You're welcome.

02:27.514 --> 02:28.781
It's like I always say,

02:28.848 --> 02:30.750
never underestimate
the power of complaining.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.522
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>I've been testing</i>
<i>that theory for decades,</i>

02:35.588 --> 02:37.490
<i>still works like gangbusters.</i>

02:37.557 --> 02:40.426

03:01.548 --> 03:03.583
{\an8}So, how we doing?

03:03.650 --> 03:06.319
{\an7}Not bad, but I still think
if you let me advertise,

03:06.386 --> 03:07.787
{\an7}we could get
more people in here.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.557
{\an9}How do you advertise a place
that ain't exactly legal?

03:10.623 --> 03:13.693
{\an8}People love secrets.
We could get flyers that say,

03:13.760 --> 03:15.461
{\an8}"Come to our
secret gambling room,

03:15.528 --> 03:17.330
{\an8}but, shh, don't tell anybody."

03:17.397 --> 03:19.198
{\an8}That's how I feel
about your ideas,

03:19.265 --> 03:20.967
{\an8}"Shh, don't tell anybody."

03:21.034 --> 03:22.268
{\an8}(door opens)

03:22.335 --> 03:23.636
{\an8}Hey, y'all.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.671
{\an7}Hey, June.

03:24.737 --> 03:26.306
{\an7}Glad you finally
came down.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.607
{\an8}This is so fun,

03:27.674 --> 03:29.208
{\an8}sneaking in through
the back alley.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.377
{\an8}(chuckles) Y'all should get
a secret knock.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.745
{\an8}'Cause secrets are fun, right?

03:32.812 --> 03:33.746
{\an8}Absolutely.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.281
{\an8}Told you.

03:35.348 --> 03:36.816
{\an8}Go do your job.

03:39.452 --> 03:40.887
{\an9}So, how's this
all work?

03:40.954 --> 03:44.624
{\an7}You play, you lose, you go home
smelling like cigarettes.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.659
{\an8}You just described
my love life.
(laughs)

03:47.360 --> 03:49.529
{\an9}And if you're gonna
take naps in your dorm,

03:49.596 --> 03:50.997
{\an8}you might want an alarm clock.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.733
{\an8}And remember, no parties.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.304
{\an8}That was a joke.

03:58.371 --> 03:59.706
{\an8}And now I know.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.808
{\an8}Wait, he has a room
here and at school?

04:01.874 --> 04:03.910
{\an7}Well, it's just for downtime
in between classes.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.579
{\an9}(sighs) Why is his life
constantly better than mine?

04:06.646 --> 04:08.881
{\an8}That's a question you should
get used to asking.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.249
{\an8}Don't be rude.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.784
{\an8}And you have a very nice life.

04:11.851 --> 04:14.887
{\an9}Yeah, yeah, loving parents,
blah, blah, blah.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.990
{\an8}Hey, you better appreciate
what you got.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.358
{\an8}There's a lot of kids out there
who have way less than you.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.360
{\an9}I guess.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.462
{\an8}You have your own room.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.263
{\an8}I never had that growing up.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.499
{\an8}And then I was in the barracks,
and then I married your mother.

04:26.566 --> 04:27.533
{\an8}Dang. (chuckles)

04:27.600 --> 04:28.868
{\an8}Yeah. Tell me about it.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.670
{\an8}What happened to appreciating
what you have?

04:30.737 --> 04:32.672
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.374
{\an8}Maybe we could
give out punch cards,

04:34.440 --> 04:35.675
{\an8}like they do
at the sandwich shop.

04:35.742 --> 04:36.943
{\an8}Punch cards for what?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.945
{\an8}You know, every ten times
you come here,

04:39.012 --> 04:40.279
{\an8}you get a free play.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.648
{\an8}What's to keep people

04:41.714 --> 04:43.616
{\an8}from punching it themselves?

04:44.651 --> 04:46.386
{\an8}I'm getting me a free sandwich.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.587
{\an7}JUNE:
Whoo-hoo!

04:47.654 --> 04:50.590
{\an8}(laughing)

04:47.654 --> 04:50.590
{\an8}(machine dinging)

04:50.657 --> 04:52.725
Sounds like you're doing
okay down here.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.695
Oh, I'm doing better
than okay. I hit big.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.030
{\an1}Whoa.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.432
{\an3}$11,000?

04:59.499 --> 05:00.833
That can't be right.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.869
Well, I see two ones
and three zeroes.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.338
Last time I checked,
that's 11,000.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.339
How did this happen?

05:06.406 --> 05:07.373
I got three bananas,

05:07.440 --> 05:08.474
and it asked me

05:08.541 --> 05:09.942
{\an1}if I wanted to parlay,
and I said,

05:10.009 --> 05:11.577
"Well, that sounds like fun,"
so I hit that button,

05:11.644 --> 05:12.879
and I went, "Whoo-hoo!"
'cause I won.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.581
(laughs)
This has got to be a glitch.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.617
Go get a manual
and-and-and look up "glitch."

05:17.684 --> 05:20.353
{\an5}We have a manual?

05:17.684 --> 05:20.353
Just find one.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.057
{\an5}Is there a problem?

05:21.788 --> 05:24.057
No, of course not.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.458
{\an1}(chuckles)

05:25.525 --> 05:26.959
That's okay.
You don't have to pay me.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.594
Of course I do. (chuckles)

05:28.661 --> 05:30.430
Good. Then pay me. (chuckles)

05:30.496 --> 05:31.864
Found the manual.
Great.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.867
This is for the
washing machines.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.803
I'll be back.

05:41.441 --> 05:42.742
Hello, Sam.

05:42.809 --> 05:43.876
{\an1}Hey.

05:43.943 --> 05:44.911
What are you doing here?

05:44.977 --> 05:45.912
Well, I was gonna study

05:45.978 --> 05:47.714
in my dorm, but there
was a sock on my door.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.015
Oh, and you didn't want
to touch it.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.483
I understand completely.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.518
Yeah, you really don't,
but that's fine.

05:52.585 --> 05:53.820
Well, I have a room here,

05:53.886 --> 05:55.388
so you could study with me
if you'd like.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.557
Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah.

05:57.623 --> 05:58.758
{\an1}That'd be great.
(chuckles)

05:58.825 --> 06:00.893
Why was there a sock
on your door?

06:00.960 --> 06:01.894
It's like a signal.

06:01.961 --> 06:02.862
A signal for what?

06:02.929 --> 06:04.731
A signal that I should
change the subject.

06:04.797 --> 06:05.898
How are your classes going?

06:05.965 --> 06:08.401
{\an3}So well, thank you
for asking.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.571
{\an6}I didn't realize
you lived on campus.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.571
I don't.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.406
{\an3}Then why do you
have a dorm room?

06:13.473 --> 06:15.808
So I have a place to go
during the gaps in my schedule.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.848
Wait, you have a single?

06:21.914 --> 06:23.382
Uh-huh.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.684
And you don't even sleep here?

06:24.751 --> 06:25.918
{\an3}Well, sometimes
I take naps,

06:25.985 --> 06:27.820
{\an3}but that mattress
is lumpy-lumpy.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.056
I live with two other girls
in a room this size.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.391
You should've complained
to President Hagemeyer.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.659
{\an3}She was very
accommodating.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.895
Wait, there are two closets?

06:35.962 --> 06:38.397
That's a bathroom.

06:38.464 --> 06:39.632
Are you kidding me?

06:39.699 --> 06:41.534
I share one with, like,
30 other people.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.402
That sounds yucky.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.671
It is, Sheldon.
It is very yucky.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.141
However yucky you think it is,
it is yuckier.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.176
Well, you're welcome
to use mine.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.612
Just squat over the seat,
don't sit.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.586
This is so unfair.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.988
You get so much more
than every other student.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.423
Fair isn't everyone
getting the same thing.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.492
Fair is everyone
getting what they deserve.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.494
Sheldon, that arrogant attitude

07:08.561 --> 07:10.163
is why no one
sits with you in class

07:10.229 --> 07:11.831
or lunch or ever.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.699
Well, I like to think
that they're maintaining

07:13.766 --> 07:15.735
a respectful distance out of
deference to my intellect.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.203
No. That's not
what they're doing.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.971
They're avoiding you
because you're an entitled brat

07:19.038 --> 07:20.840
who thinks that you're better
than everybody else.

07:20.907 --> 07:22.909
So, I should just pretend
I'm less intelligent than I am?

07:22.975 --> 07:24.710
You should realize that there
are more important things

07:24.777 --> 07:26.179
in life than how smart you are.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.580
Well, I'm also cute as a button,

07:27.647 --> 07:29.048
but it seems shallow to say it.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.218
You could say it.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.788
{\an3}So, Georgie
found the manual

07:35.855 --> 07:37.557
{\an3}and figured out
what the problem was.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.826
I know the problem.
I cleaned you out.

07:39.892 --> 07:43.229
{\an3}Because when these
machines get unplugged,

07:43.296 --> 07:46.199
{\an3}they reset at the highest
possible payout.

07:46.265 --> 07:48.634
Wow, sounds like your problem.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.470
Well...

07:51.537 --> 07:54.006
I don't have $11,000.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.575
I understand.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.742
Thank you.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.144
So, what are you
gonna do about it?

07:58.211 --> 08:01.547
Well, obviously,
lunch is on me.

08:01.614 --> 08:03.549
Oh, wow. The whole lunch?

08:03.616 --> 08:06.519
Even the little
frilly toothpicks?

08:07.987 --> 08:09.121
What do you want me to do?

08:09.188 --> 08:10.857
Make me a partner.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.625
{\an3}What?

08:12.692 --> 08:13.693
{\an3}No.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.261
{\an3}I already brought
Georgie in,

08:15.328 --> 08:16.863
{\an3}I have to pay
the police off,

08:16.929 --> 08:19.065
{\an3}I can't have another hand
in the till.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.634
Sounds like your problem again.

08:25.571 --> 08:26.772
{\an1}And then she said
people avoid me

08:26.839 --> 08:28.608
{\an5}because I'm arrogant and
entitled.
Hmm...

08:28.674 --> 08:30.509
I don't even know why
it bothers me.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.111
Well, Sheldon,
it's normal to care

08:32.178 --> 08:34.547
what others in your peer group
think of you.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.082
Why? It's not logical.

08:36.148 --> 08:39.150
(sighs) Hear me out.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.519
You see, humans

08:40.586 --> 08:42.922
{\an3}have evolved
as social animals,

08:42.989 --> 08:46.926
{\an3}so your feeling hurt might be
a deep evolutionary desire

08:46.993 --> 08:49.128
to cooperate with others

08:49.195 --> 08:50.630
to ensure your survival.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.165
{\an1}So, you're saying it makes
sociobiological sense

08:53.232 --> 08:54.867
{\an1}to want other people
to like me?

08:54.934 --> 08:57.937
Yes, and you may even
get benefits from it.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.673
It's like on that show
you enjoy,<i> Star Track.</i>

09:00.740 --> 09:02.708
<i>Trek.</i>
Right.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.077
{\an3}Captain Kirk can't
do it all by himself.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.979
He needs Doctor Spock.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.915
Mister.
Right.

09:08.981 --> 09:10.216
And Mister McCoy.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.951
Doctor.
Right.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.687
{\an1}Well, technically, they were
his subordinate officers,

09:14.754 --> 09:17.556
{\an1}but Kirk did always deal
with them in a friendly manner,

09:17.623 --> 09:19.125
so I take your point.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.593
{\an3}Good man.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.595
{\an1}I suppose I could treat it
like an experiment.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.564
{\an1}Run an analysis of the benefits
of having people like me.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.934
{\an3}That sounds like
an idea the Captain,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.037
{\an3}the Doctor, or the Mister
would be proud of.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.605
Excellent.

09:32.672 --> 09:36.108
{\an3}You know, you'd think
a smart fella like Spock

09:36.175 --> 09:37.243
would have a doctorate.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.978
{\an1}Actually, Spock
rejected an offer

09:39.045 --> 09:41.847
{\an1}from the Vulcan Science Academy
in order to attend Starfleet.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.317
Huh. Not the choice
I would have made,

09:44.383 --> 09:46.652
but I'm happy for him.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.791
How'd it go?

09:51.857 --> 09:54.193
Terrible.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.828
She wants to be a partner.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.863
You really can't just pay her?
I thought you had money.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.267
I used to.
Now all I have is this.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.135
Not all of it,
some of it's mine.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.237
Well, some of it's hers,
too, now.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.639
{\an3}Well, is she
a partner forever

10:06.706 --> 10:08.074
{\an3}or just until
she gets her money back?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.308
I don't know.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.644
Seems like an important
question to ask.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.045
Well, I didn't ask it.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.246
All this yelling can't be good

10:14.313 --> 10:15.348
for your blood pressure.

10:15.414 --> 10:16.782
You're right.

10:16.849 --> 10:19.318
I think I'm just
gonna step outside

10:19.385 --> 10:21.153
and have a cigarette.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.155
Smoking ain't any better.

10:23.222 --> 10:26.292
Good. Perhaps the end is near.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.030
Excuse me, Sam.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.332
What?
How are you today?

10:33.399 --> 10:36.168
{\an5}Since when do you care?

10:33.399 --> 10:36.168
12:07 yesterday.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.104
{\an3}In light of the fact that
we're both human beings

10:38.170 --> 10:40.740
and have a genetic interest
in each other's prosperity,

10:40.806 --> 10:42.408
you may use
my dorm room to study.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.277
Wait, are you serious?
That would be amazing.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.280
Good. And does that make you
feel more positive about me,

10:48.347 --> 10:50.016
less positive, or neutral?

10:50.082 --> 10:53.185
Um, more, I guess.

10:53.252 --> 10:54.787
{\an3}Excellent.

10:54.854 --> 10:55.921
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Dr. Sturgis</i>

10:55.988 --> 10:57.723
<i>may have been onto something.</i>

10:57.790 --> 11:00.192
<i>It did feel nice to be liked.</i>

11:00.259 --> 11:01.794
<i>Not as nice as knowing</i>

11:01.861 --> 11:04.163
<i>you're the smartest boy</i>
<i>in Texas, but what was?</i>

11:04.230 --> 11:06.098
{\an3}Hey. Did I just
hear you say

11:06.165 --> 11:07.867
{\an3}you have a dorm room
you're letting people use?

11:07.933 --> 11:09.769
{\an1}Yes. I'm letting Sam
use it to study.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.137
You think there's any chance
my girlfriend and I

11:11.203 --> 11:12.138
could use it sometime?

11:12.204 --> 11:13.973
You two study together?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.341
We'd like to.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.675
It's been a while.

11:16.742 --> 11:17.777
Well, I use it during the day,

11:17.843 --> 11:19.045
so it's only available at night.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.679
Nights work for us.

11:20.746 --> 11:22.181
Then it's all yours.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.816
(chuckles) Thanks, man.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.818
And how does this make you
feel about me?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.887
More positive,
less positive, or neutral?

11:27.953 --> 11:29.688
{\an3}Really, really
positive.

11:29.755 --> 11:30.990
Great. Tell a friend.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.025
{\an3}All right.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.828
I might have to draw up
a schedule.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.336
{\an3}How's this?

11:44.403 --> 11:46.138
Eh. Looks great.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.243
What the hell is all this?

11:51.310 --> 11:53.279
June brought in
twinkle lights.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.447
{\an5}Oh, did she?

11:53.345 --> 11:54.447
I thought it might

11:54.513 --> 11:56.215
{\an3}make things a little
more festive.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.250
Looks like Christmas in jail.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.986
(laughs) I actually have
a really good story about that.

12:01.053 --> 12:01.854
Take it down.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.389
Maybe when you're
in a better mood.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.991
{\an5}I think it's pretty.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.991
Nobody asked you, Wade.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.828
{\an1}We may need to have a chat
about customer service.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.429
We're gonna have a chat
about a lot of things,

12:10.496 --> 12:12.398
starting with how come
you're redecorating

12:12.465 --> 12:14.166
without even asking me.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.468
I'm a partner.

12:15.534 --> 12:16.469
A silent partner.

12:16.535 --> 12:17.937
Hey, I can help here.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.472
{\an3}She's got some
good ideas.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.107
So, you're on her side now?

12:21.173 --> 12:22.508
A good idea's
a good idea,

12:22.575 --> 12:24.143
who cares where
it comes from.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.444
{\an1}Thank you.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.413
And I like your idea
about putting a dartboard

12:27.480 --> 12:28.881
in the corner.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.283
Oh. So, this is how
it's gonna be?

12:31.350 --> 12:32.751
{\an1}Fine.

12:32.818 --> 12:36.188
{\an1}When Wade here
takes a dart to the head,

12:36.255 --> 12:39.291
{\an1}don't come crying
to me.

12:39.358 --> 12:40.793
(machines chiming)

12:40.860 --> 12:43.929
{\an1}I don't want a dart
in the head.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.798
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>Over the next several days,</i>

12:45.865 --> 12:48.200
<i>my social experiment</i>
<i>was providing clear-cut data</i>

12:48.267 --> 12:49.435
<i>about the benefits</i>

12:49.502 --> 12:51.337
{\an5}<i>of being well-liked.</i>

12:49.502 --> 12:51.337
Hey, Sheldon.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.305
Heard you like these.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.907
Thank you.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.342
It's the best watery
chocolate milk on the market.

12:56.408 --> 12:58.177
{\an1}Thank you for letting me
use your room.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.180
{\an5}ADULT SHELDON:
<i>I suppose it was like</i>
<i>the old saying,</i>

13:01.247 --> 13:03.282
<i>"I scratch your back,</i>
<i>you scratch mine,"</i>

13:03.349 --> 13:05.284
<i>which I actually</i>
<i>have issues with.</i>

13:05.351 --> 13:06.485
<i>Why is your back itchy?</i>

13:06.552 --> 13:08.254
<i>A rash? Chicken pox?</i>

13:08.320 --> 13:10.456
<i>Scabies? Scratch your own back.</i>

13:10.523 --> 13:12.558
{\an1}It turns out it's easy
to make people like you.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.093
You just have to
give them things.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.896
Wow. I think you've really
discovered something here.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.965
Perhaps I should publish before
someone else stumbles onto it.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.468
All right. Oh. Hey.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.936
An all-nighter, huh?

13:24.003 --> 13:26.071
Oh, yeah. All night.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.306
{\an3}Thank you.

13:27.373 --> 13:29.108
{\an3}Someone's gonna ace
those midterms.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.576
Yeah, you know it.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.179
{\an1}My room has become
quite the little study hall.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.247
Yeah, they may not be...

13:35.314 --> 13:36.949
Uh, you know what, you're fine.

13:37.683 --> 13:40.219
{\an1}Well, isn't this nice?
Little grandmother, grandson

13:40.286 --> 13:41.353
bonding time.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.955
What's going on?

13:43.022 --> 13:45.824
Can't I buy
my favorite grandson lunch?

13:46.692 --> 13:49.395
Look, we got to talk

13:46.692 --> 13:49.395
about this June situation.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.497
{\an3}She's just trying
to make the place better.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.566
This is our thing.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.534
We can't just let her take over.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.469
She ain't taking over,

13:57.536 --> 13:59.138
and she likes to hear my ideas.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.941
(scoffs) She's just using you
to get her way.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.943
{\an3}You know what
your problem is?

14:04.009 --> 14:05.578
{\an3}You don't like anything
you didn't think of yourself.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.880
{\an5}Is that so?

14:05.644 --> 14:07.880
Yeah.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.381
Well, I thought of
bringing you in,

14:09.448 --> 14:11.050
and that wasn't a good idea.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.251
If that's how you feel,

14:12.318 --> 14:13.419
{\an3}then we got nothing more
to talk about.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.588
I guess not.
Well, okay.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.062
You can go now.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.431
{\an3}My chicken fingers
ain't here yet.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.870
(whistle blows on TV)

14:31.937 --> 14:34.139
{\an5}Can we watch <i> 90210?</i>

14:31.937 --> 14:34.139
What's that?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.041
{\an3}It's about kids who go
to school in Beverly Hills.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.444
(groans) If you want to see
a show about Beverly Hills,

14:38.510 --> 14:40.279
{\an1}we should watch
<i>Beverly Hillbillies.</i>

14:40.346 --> 14:41.880
(chuckles) That's a show.

14:41.947 --> 14:42.548
What's it about?

14:42.615 --> 14:44.416
Eh... Imagine your meemaw

14:44.483 --> 14:45.618
moving to California.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.486
{\an5}I'd watch that.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.486
(phone ringing)

14:50.256 --> 14:51.357
Hello?

14:51.423 --> 14:52.891
Sheldon, it's for you.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.093
Who is it?

14:54.159 --> 14:55.995
{\an3}Who is it?

14:56.061 --> 14:57.096
{\an3}Travis.

14:57.162 --> 14:58.130
Who's Travis?

14:58.197 --> 15:00.232
Who are you?

15:00.299 --> 15:01.367
Friend of Sheldon's.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.035
{\an1}Really?
Really?

15:03.102 --> 15:04.303
Hi, Travis.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.005
{\an3}Oh,

15:06.071 --> 15:08.073
Monday's no good. I can
pencil you in for Wednesday.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.675
You got it.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.310
{\an3}Goodbye.

15:11.377 --> 15:13.178
Is that a friend from school?

15:13.245 --> 15:14.280
I suppose.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.048
Well, that's exciting.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.316
And a little exhausting.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.917
I've been letting students
use my dorm

15:18.984 --> 15:20.486
{\an1}to study while I'm not there,
and it's made me

15:20.552 --> 15:21.920
very popular.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.522
{\an1}It's nice that you're
helping people out.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.424
{\an5}(phone rings)

15:23.589 --> 15:25.424
{\an1}Yes, but who knew
having friends

15:25.491 --> 15:26.925
involved so much scheduling?

15:26.992 --> 15:28.427
{\an3}Sheldon,
some girl for you.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.662
{\an1}SHELDON:
Hello?

15:29.728 --> 15:30.796
Hi, Sarah.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.333
Well, if you and Ben really need
the room on Wednesday,

15:34.400 --> 15:35.601
you're going to have
to work it out

15:35.668 --> 15:37.236
{\an1}with Travis and Amy
because they asked first.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.637
He's getting popular.

15:38.704 --> 15:41.073
I think I might know why
those kids want to use his room.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.441
Well, he said
for studying.

15:42.508 --> 15:44.343
They ain't studying.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.345
Oh, now it makes sense.

15:46.412 --> 15:48.947
You really think they're...

15:49.014 --> 15:51.250
A bunch of college kids
in an empty dorm room?

15:51.317 --> 15:53.585
(sighs) Should we tell him?

15:53.652 --> 15:55.421
I don't want to tell him.
Do you?

15:55.487 --> 15:56.955
{\an5}I'll tell him.

15:55.487 --> 15:56.955
No.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.892
{\an6}Okay, hang on,
she volunteered.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.892
No.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.398
Whoa, and the '70s are back.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.401
All we need are the Bee Gees
and bell-bottoms,

16:09.468 --> 16:11.503
and it's Studio 54.

16:11.570 --> 16:14.239
I don't know what any
of that means, but all right.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.609
So, I guess your meemaw
came over on our side.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.713
{\an3}No. She pissed me off,
so now she gets a disco ball.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.549
I don't want to get caught in
the middle of a family squabble.

16:23.615 --> 16:26.352
Oh, don't worry,
she'll know it was me.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.287
Then I love it.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.655
Now, what's a Bee Gee?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.256
It's a brother singing band.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.759
They did all the music
for <i> Saturday Night Fever.</i>

16:33.826 --> 16:36.295
What's <i> Saturday Night Fever?</i>

16:36.362 --> 16:38.630
Damn, I'm old.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.035
Hey, Shelly, you busy?

16:43.102 --> 16:45.137
I'm turning my dorm room
schedule into a spreadsheet,

16:45.204 --> 16:47.473
so people can sign up at school
and stop calling me.

16:47.539 --> 16:50.008
Yeah, about that...

16:50.075 --> 16:52.411
{\an1}George?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.113
Y-Your mother and I
are worried that

16:54.179 --> 16:56.448
your friends at school might be
taking advantage of you.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.716
What do you mean?

16:57.783 --> 16:58.584
(sighs)

16:58.650 --> 17:00.753
They might not be
using it in the...

17:00.819 --> 17:03.322
the spirit that you intended.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.290
How are they using it?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.693
{\an3}Mary?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.627
{\an1}(sighs)

17:09.694 --> 17:13.398
We're worried that those couples

17:13.464 --> 17:16.602
are not going there to study...

17:16.667 --> 17:18.537
But that's why
I'm lending them the room.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.606
{\an1}And that is why
we are concerned.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.308
Are you saying they're using it
as a goof-off room?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.777
Yes.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.777
(stammers)

17:24.843 --> 17:26.712
{\an3}That's exactly
what we're saying.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.614
Well, let's drive
over there right now

17:28.680 --> 17:30.082
and catch them in the act.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.451
{\an5}No!
L-Let's just
let them finish...

17:32.518 --> 17:33.786
goofing off tonight,

17:33.852 --> 17:35.454
and we'll put
a stop to it tomorrow.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.556
Well, thank you for telling me.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.591
We thought that you should know.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.126
{\an1}Mm.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.097
Those dirty goof-offs.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.103

that is ♪

17:51.170 --> 17:52.171
♪ Swimming pools... ♪

17:52.237 --> 17:53.572
{\an1}So those are
the Clampetts,

17:53.639 --> 17:56.542
{\an1}and they moved from
the backwoods to Beverly Hills.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.344
{\an3}Oh, in <i> 90210</i> the Walshes
moved from Minnesota.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.548
They have a hard time fitting in
with those California snobs?

18:02.614 --> 18:04.750
{\an6}Oh, yeah.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.750
These guys do, too.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.653
{\an5}It's practically the same show.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.653
(door slams)

18:07.719 --> 18:08.687
Where's Georgie?

18:08.754 --> 18:09.688
In the garage.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.191
{\an5}Disco ball, my ass.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.191
(chuckles) What's going on?

18:12.257 --> 18:14.560
It's a gambling room,
not a damn dance club,

18:14.626 --> 18:17.196
that's what's going on. Georgie!

18:17.262 --> 18:19.164
{\an3}I want to watch
that show.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.867
