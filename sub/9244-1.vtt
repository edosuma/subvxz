- Hi, Sister Helen.
- Hi. How ya doin'?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.393
Well, if it ain't the late Sister Helen.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.520
I got a note from my mama, Idella.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.065
Do you need a new composition book?
How about you, Melvin?

02:30.233 --> 02:34.653
The resident counselor wants us at their
meeting tomorrow. Can you be there?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.239
Yes. Oh... New poetry books.

02:37.407 --> 02:40.200
- Your poem got all smudged.
- Smudged?

02:40.368 --> 02:43.412
Sister Helen, I got
another letter from that guy.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.374
- Which guy is that?
- Angola inmate. Death row.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.500
Oh, yeah.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.920
Could you write to him?
He could use some friendly words.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.840
Sure. I'll come up after the class.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.427
- It got smudged.
- You can still read it.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.269
"There's a woman
standin' there in the dark

03:07.437 --> 03:09.730
and she's got big arms to hold you,

03:09.898 --> 03:12.774
but you won't feel
those arms, that hug,

03:12.942 --> 03:15.152
till you can see her face.

03:15.320 --> 03:20.032
So you stand there waiting
for the light at the end of the road."

03:21.284 --> 03:25.120
- Idella, that is so fine.
- Thank you.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.087
My lawyer seems to have disappeared.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.131
So I could use some help
on the legal end,

03:36.299 --> 03:39.468
but I'd take a kind word or a visit.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.553
It gets real quiet here sometimes.

03:41.721 --> 03:45.140
None of these guys on the row
can afford attorneys for appeals.

03:45.308 --> 03:48.477
We get frantic phone calls
from death row inmates,

03:48.645 --> 03:51.730
- begging us to find them attorneys.
- Who work for nothin'.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.691
That's right. Each petition
takes hours to prepare.

03:54.859 --> 03:58.070
Attorneys aren't exactly
lining up for the job.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.283
(♪ "The Face of Love")

04:19.259 --> 04:21.093
Dear Sister Helen,

04:21.261 --> 04:26.723
Thank you for writin' to me. I'm writin'
from my home, my six by eight foot cell.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.393
I'm in here 23 hours a day.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.354
We don't work on death row.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.647
We're special here.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.984
They keep us away from the
general population of the prison.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.529
We're the elite, cos we gonna fry.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.532
It's hard not to get soft in this cell.
I press my footlocker,

04:43.700 --> 04:48.537
try to get my muscles in shape,
but it's hard not to get fat.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.541
Rice, potatoes, pancakes, beans.

04:52.709 --> 04:57.796
Sometimes I feel like a sow that's being
fattened up for a Christmas slaughter.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.300
I had a dream that I was
about to be fried in the chair

05:01.467 --> 05:04.594
and a guard came into my cell
with a chef's hat on.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.471
He started to roll me in breadcrumbs,

05:06.639 --> 05:09.224
lickin' his chops and all.

05:09.392 --> 05:13.145
Maybe I'm weird to have dreams like
that, but your mind does funny things

05:13.313 --> 05:16.648
when you're surrounded
by people that wanna kill you.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.235
Anyway, thanks for writin'.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.904
I don't get many letters or visitors.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.950
No one in my family seems able
to make the trip out here. I understand.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.579
It's a long drive from Slidell.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.252
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Father.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.006
- Sister...
- Helen Prejean. Nice to meet you.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.978
- Have you been in a prison before?
- No, Father.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.438
Sister Clement and I sang

05:56.606 --> 05:59.024
at the juvenile detention center
in New Orleans.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.152
We sang "Kumbaya"
and the boys really liked it.

06:02.320 --> 06:08.200
They started makin' up their own verses,
singin' "Someone's escapin', my Lord..."

06:08.368 --> 06:11.495
The guards made us
sing a different song.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.206
Where is your habit?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.209
Our sisters haven't worn
the habit for 20 years, Father.

06:17.377 --> 06:21.463
You are aware of the papal request
regarding nuns' garments, aren't you?

06:23.508 --> 06:26.885
I believe the Pope said
"distinctive clothing", not habits.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.640
Well, I'm sure you will interpret it
in your own way. Whatever's convenient.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.018
Matthew Poncelet.

06:35.645 --> 06:39.606
I remember him from the news.
Him and another fella

06:39.774 --> 06:43.485
shot two children in the back
of the head on a lovers' lane.

06:43.653 --> 06:47.656
Raped the girl,
stabbed her several times.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.244
Do you know what you're gettin' into?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.081
So what is it, Sister?

06:56.249 --> 07:01.420
Morbid fascination?
Bleedin'-heart sympathy?

07:01.587 --> 07:04.756
He wrote me and asked me to come.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.008
There's no romance here, Sister.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.804
No Jimmy Cagney "I'm wrongly accused.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.474
If I only had someone to believe in me."

07:14.642 --> 07:20.272
They are all con men and they will take
advantage of you every way they can.

07:20.440 --> 07:25.986
You must be very, very careful.
Do you understand?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.320
Yes, Father.

07:27.488 --> 07:31.116
These men don't see many females.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.036
For you to wear the habit
might help instill respect.

07:35.204 --> 07:40.250
For you to flout authority
will only encourage them to do the same.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.309
Woman on the tier!

08:19.165 --> 08:21.958
You can wait over there.
We'll bring your man out for you.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.335
Well, Matthew, I made it.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.298
Thanks for comin', ma'am.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.344
Never thought I'd be visitin'
with no nun.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.730
- So you're a nun.
- Yep.

09:33.197 --> 09:36.741
I'm here to listen, and whatever
you wanna talk about, that's fine.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.660
You're very sincere.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.413
What do you mean?

09:42.331 --> 09:43.665
- You never done this before?
- No.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.584
Never been this close to a murderer?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.752
Not that I know of.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.005
You live in St. Thomas.
Lots of niggers.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.341
They knock each other off
like beer cans off a fence.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.804
When I got your letter
and I seen "Helen" on it,

09:57.972 --> 09:59.514
I thought of my first ex-old lady.

09:59.682 --> 10:03.852
I almost ripped it up.
She turned me in. Called the cops.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.605
Orphaned our kid, the stupid bitch.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.690
- You've got a kid?
- Yeah, a con with a kid.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.191
- Girl or boy?
- Girl.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.277
What's her name?

10:12.445 --> 10:14.863
- You ask a lot of questions.
- I don't know you.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.323
Well, never mind.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.664
In your letter you say
you work with poor people.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.293
Your daddy was a lawyer.
You come from money, don't you?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.378
Some.

10:30.546 --> 10:34.591
And you live in St. Thomas projects?
I don't know who's crazier, you or me.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.218
- I live where I work.
- Yeah. In a slum.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.804
- What about you?
- I live here.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.223
You... were brought up poor?

10:43.059 --> 10:46.102
Ain't nobody with money on death row.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.105
Then you and I have
somethin' in common.

10:49.273 --> 10:53.026
- What's that?
- We both live with the poor.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.654
Mm.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.666
Ain't you gonna ask me what I done?

11:09.085 --> 11:12.587
- The chaplain filled me in.
- Farley?

11:12.755 --> 11:15.507
He's a very religious man.

11:23.140 --> 11:27.268
I didn't kill nobody.
Carl went crazy on me.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.271
- Carl?
- Vitello. He oughta be sittin' here.

11:30.439 --> 11:34.734
Went nuts on me. I was scared,
did what he said, held that boy back.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.361
He killed them.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.573
You watched him kill these kids?

11:40.741 --> 11:42.992
I'll tell you the truth, ma'am.

11:43.160 --> 11:47.580
Me and Carl were loaded on downs,
acid and booze when this happened.

11:47.748 --> 11:51.334
I hadn't slept in two nights.
I was outta my head.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.628
But I didn't kill 'em.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.549
I didn't kill nobody.
I swear to God I didn't.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.053
Ally.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.597
- Ally?
- Her name.

12:07.643 --> 12:11.479
- She's cute.
- She's 11... or 12. I don't know.

12:11.647 --> 12:15.108
She was born when I was first in prison.
I seen her once.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.319
- When was that?
- When she was three.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.489
- Do you write to her?
- I don't know where she is.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.576
She's in Texas somewhere.
Foster parents.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.911
Go on and finish up, Sister.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.586
Look... They're about
to go on a killin' spree here.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.338
They're gonna zap
this guy Tobias tonight.

12:37.506 --> 12:42.177
The guards are takin' bets on who's
next. I'm at even odds. It's not good.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.847
So I got two chances: The pardon board
or the federal appeals court.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.267
I wrote the motion on the appeal,
but I need somebody to file it.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.977
Can you help me with that?

12:53.105 --> 12:55.190
You know how to write a motion?

12:55.357 --> 12:58.109
When your back's against the wall,
you learn the law real fast.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.571
Call it special motivation.
I been on death row six years.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.324
I've studied every law book
I can get my hands on.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.328
This stuff is about my case -
transcripts of the trials, legal papers.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.372
Maybe they'll help you
get ahold of things faster.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.043
You rustle me up a lawyer,
we can file a motion for appeal.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.718
- You ain't comin' back.
- No, I... Are these your only copies?

13:23.886 --> 13:27.722
I got my own copy. But if you ain't
gonna help me, I don't wanna waste 'em.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.017
I'll do my best.
And I appreciate your trust.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.188
Sister, I don't trust nobody in here.

13:35.356 --> 13:39.150
But you don't kiss my ass or preach
that hellfire and brimstone crap.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.362
I respect that. You got guts.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.241
You're livin' in a neighborhood
with every nigger carryin' a gun.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.080
Come on, Helen. Hit it!

14:07.304 --> 14:11.182
Playing possum, huh? You think
you can trick us, you dumb animal?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.268
You think you can fool us?

14:27.616 --> 14:30.785
- How fast was I goin'?
- 75 miles an hour, ma'am.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.787
Wow!

14:32.955 --> 14:35.540
- Are you a nun?
- Yes, sir.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.544
Never gave a ticket to no nun before.

14:39.712 --> 14:44.632
Gave a ticket to a guy from the IRS
one time. Got audited the next year.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.264
Sister, I'm gonna let this one slide.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.433
- But keep your speed down.
- Yes, sir.

15:09.617 --> 15:13.494
On Friday night, Walter Delacroix,
age 17, and Hope Percy, 18,

15:13.662 --> 15:15.330
had been just two happy people

15:15.497 --> 15:17.665
celebrating one of
life's turning points.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.335
The couple was shot twice at close range

15:20.502 --> 15:22.712
in the back of the head
with a .22 rifle.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.925
Poncelet and Vitello also face
six counts of aggravated kidnapping

15:27.092 --> 15:29.636
and one charge of aggravated rape.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.513
Before the murders,

15:32.681 --> 15:36.976
the men allegedly had cut a path
of terror across the area.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.396
A police spokesman said today,
in the wake of the murders,

15:40.814 --> 15:43.024
Poncelet addressed the judge as "Cap"

15:43.192 --> 15:46.861
and smirked when the jury
found him guilty of murder today.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.906
Poncelet claims Vitello
killed both of them.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.494
- Y'all think he's lyin'.
- Vitello accuses Poncelet.

15:54.662 --> 15:58.456
Both say the other did the actual
killing. Somebody's lyin' to somebody.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.625
They were both there.
We know that much.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.044
How is it possible one guy gets life,
the other death?

16:03.212 --> 16:07.173
Well, the State has probably got
a stronger case against Poncelet.

16:07.341 --> 16:11.636
Vitello had a better lawyer. Created
a reasonable doubt in the jury's mind.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.847
- And Vitello gets life, Poncelet death.
- Yeah.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.432
Bad luck.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.019
He needs help, Sister.

16:20.187 --> 16:24.941
There's this lawyer, Hilton Barber.
He's aware of the case and told me no.

16:25.109 --> 16:29.445
- Maybe you can change his mind.
- With the aim of gettin' him out?

16:29.613 --> 16:32.240
I'm not sure I wanna run
into this guy on the street.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.201
There's no way he's gettin' off.
He was there. He was an accomplice.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.078
That's life!

16:37.246 --> 16:40.581
A life sentence in a
Louisiana prison is for real.

16:40.749 --> 16:43.251
You're just tryin' to stop
the State from killin' him.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.674
You want out? That's cool with me.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.593
You don't have to go back there.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.681
Get tough on sentencin'.
Get tough on lenient parole boards.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.101
Get tough on judges
who pass light sentences.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.397
- Hello.
- Sister Helen?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.358
- Who's this?
- Matt Poncelet, Sister.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.821
I know I'm on death row, but there's
guys been here years and years.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.742
I didn't know this was comin'.
They set a date.

17:15.909 --> 17:19.328
- What?
- They're gonna kill me on the 13th.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.790
I didn't know you needed a lawyer
to get a pardon board hearing.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.501
I'd do it myself if they'd let me,
but they say...

17:25.669 --> 17:27.670
OK... OK, Matthew.

17:27.838 --> 17:32.175
Uh... I think I know of a lawyer
that may be able to help you.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.803
- I'll do my best, all right?
- Sister, come through for me.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.932
You're all I got. They got me on
a greased rail to the death house here.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.561
I ain't heard from you. You ain't
fadin' out on me, are you, Sister?

17:44.480 --> 17:48.274
I'll get you the lawyer.
Just... try not to worry.

17:48.442 --> 17:52.028
I'll call you soon. Bye.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.655
It's about time the State
got with the program.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.825
Call me sentimental,
but I'd rather see him fry.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.829
Barring any last-minute appeals or
stays, Poncelet will die

18:01.997 --> 18:05.500
under the State's new execution
procedure, the lethal injection machine.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.337
- Hello?
- Luis, this is Helen.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.965
Can you give me the name of that lawyer
you wanted me to talk to?

18:13.133 --> 18:15.843
- How long you been doin' this, Sister?
- Doin' this?

18:16.011 --> 18:18.846
- Counseling death row inmates.
- Oh, I'm not counseling him.

18:19.014 --> 18:22.683
- I just met him once.
- What's your impression?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.645
I don't know if I like him.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.648
He needs help, but the best thing
is to bring him to you.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.608
Well, I'll do my best.

18:33.570 --> 18:37.156
Courts don't wanna hear appeals
on death-penalty cases.

18:37.324 --> 18:41.786
You can have new evidence of innocence
and the court won't hear the case.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.373
We're the pariahs. We're...
"Have many rabbit."

18:45.541 --> 18:48.751
Think that's a "for sale" sign
or a cry for help?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.878
Or is it braggin'?

18:52.548 --> 18:57.552
Imagine that poor guy. Bought two
rabbits a year ago and now he's overrun.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.595
Comin' like popcorn!

19:02.808 --> 19:06.978
The governor runs for re-election
so they set a date for my execution.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.731
- Show how tough he is on crime.
- Matt, I agree with you.

19:10.899 --> 19:12.942
Politics did play a big part in this,

19:13.110 --> 19:15.027
but don't bring it up
before the pardon board.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.487
Why not?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.489
Because it's full
of political appointees.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.242
The last thing they wanna hear

19:21.410 --> 19:24.537
is some convicted killer
tellin' them they is bunk.

19:24.705 --> 19:29.250
We have to present you as a human being
and convince them to spare your life.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.918
We have to prove I'm innocent.

19:31.086 --> 19:34.714
We're filing appeals with
the federal and supreme courts.

19:34.882 --> 19:39.010
This is a pardon board. It don't matter
to them whether you pulled the trigger.

19:39.178 --> 19:43.681
They're gonna be thinkin' of the crime,
and of you as a monster.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.268
It's easy to kill a monster,
but it's hard to kill a human being.

19:47.436 --> 19:51.981
We need people that know you to speak
for you. Your mama should be there.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.776
I don't want her there. She'll bust out
cryin' till she can't say nothin'.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.529
Your mama should still be there.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.532
No. She'd have to hear
the Delacroixs, the Percys, the DA.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.119
- But if she's not at the hearing...
- Excuse me for buttin' in.

20:05.287 --> 20:09.790
You're right. It's gonna be upsettin'
for her but... she's your mama, Matthew.

20:09.958 --> 20:14.295
She should have the opportunity
to speak for her child.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.755
She's just gonna blubber her head off.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.133
Yeah, well, she has
the right to do that.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.932
What if you die and she hasn't
had a chance to speak for you?

20:27.100 --> 20:31.145
Don't you think it'll always eat at her,
wonderin' if she could have saved you?

20:37.861 --> 20:40.780
I'll think about it, but I got my pride.

20:40.948 --> 20:45.034
I ain't gonna kiss ass in front of these
people. I ain't gonna kiss nobody's ass.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.789
(♪ "This is the Day the Lord Has Made")

20:56.046 --> 20:59.840
- What are you making, Kenitra?
- An Easter card for my mama.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.349
♪ I will rejoice

21:08.517 --> 21:12.979
♪ I will rejoice and be glad in him

21:13.146 --> 21:16.190
♪ And be glad in him

21:16.358 --> 21:21.195
♪ This is the day that the Lord has made

21:21.363 --> 21:26.325
♪ I will rejoice and be glad in him

21:26.493 --> 21:28.995
♪ This is the day

21:29.162 --> 21:35.042
♪ This is the day
that the Lord has made ♪

21:44.720 --> 21:46.262
Happy Easter.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.567
- Yes?
- Mrs. Poncelet?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.235
No.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.864
Mrs. Poncelet, please.

22:05.032 --> 22:09.035
She don't live here. Who is it?

22:09.202 --> 22:13.831
My name is Sister Helen Prejean.
I know your son Matthew.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.420
Happy Easter.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.090
- You sure you're a sister?
- Yes.

22:24.301 --> 22:27.261
- You're not from the TV?
- No.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.805
You're sure?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.770
How do you know Mattie?

22:35.937 --> 22:38.230
I met him on death row.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.902
Well, you never know
who's at your front door.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.906
So what do you want? Mattie send you
for money, for cigarettes?

22:47.991 --> 22:49.408
No.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.580
So what do you want?

22:56.708 --> 23:00.795
You know they set the date
for Matthew's execution.

23:00.962 --> 23:06.550
Yeah. The prison called. Said if it
goes down, do I got death insurance.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.177
Hah!

23:08.345 --> 23:11.430
What a laugh!
I ain't even got food money.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.558
His pardon board hearing
is this Wednesday.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.229
His lawyer thinks it'd be
a good idea if you were there.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.356
What does Mattie think?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.652
He's worried. He wants to protect you.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.363
Well, it's a little late for that.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.991
That show Inside Crime
did a thing on Mattie

23:31.159 --> 23:33.869
and told how I tried
to help him and everything.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.288
A regular Ma Barker or somethin'.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.416
Now I'm famous.

23:38.583 --> 23:43.254
Yesterday I was in the store
and I see these two ladies eyein' me.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.465
When I get closer,
I hear one of them say,

23:46.633 --> 23:50.219
"I can't wait to hear that
they've executed that monster,

23:50.387 --> 23:52.721
Matthew Poncelet."

23:53.849 --> 23:55.933
That's cruel.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.813
My boys are havin'
a real hard time at school.

24:00.981 --> 24:05.526
Kids picking on 'em,
beating 'em up, calling 'em names.

24:06.903 --> 24:09.738
Someone put a dead squirrel
in my little Troy's locker.

24:09.906 --> 24:13.159
Poor boy came home cryin'.

24:13.326 --> 24:15.703
What'd he ever do to anyone?

24:19.875 --> 24:25.171
I just keep... tryin' to figure out
what I done wrong.

24:27.507 --> 24:31.552
They have been ploughed over by life.
He first got in trouble when he was 15.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.680
- Every kid does that.
- His daddy was never around.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.100
Most of your kids in the project
are raised by single parents.

24:38.268 --> 24:43.147
They're not rapin' and killin' people.
Really, Helen, you're being suckered.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.399
What about the parents of these victims?

24:45.567 --> 24:49.403
- Have you counseled them?
- You think they'd wanna talk to me?

24:49.571 --> 24:52.823
Don't people in your neighborhood
need your help?

24:52.991 --> 24:54.992
Yes, Mama. I'm still workin' with them.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.995
But why are you visiting with murderers?

24:58.163 --> 25:00.956
For all the energy that
you're putting into them,

25:01.124 --> 25:04.460
you could be keepin' other kids
from going to prison.

25:04.628 --> 25:09.924
Mama's friends read an article which
associated your name with Poncelet.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.676
- My name was in the paper?
- It has nothing to do with that.

25:12.844 --> 25:17.348
I am simply curious.
Helen, what has drawn you to this?

25:18.767 --> 25:20.601
Mama, I don't know.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.771
I feel caught more than drawn.

25:24.773 --> 25:29.485
The man's in trouble and, for some
reason, I'm the only one he trusts.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.028
Your heart's in the right place,

25:31.196 --> 25:34.031
but a full heart shouldn't
follow an empty head.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.407
Or an empty stomach.

25:38.161 --> 25:42.122
You'd always bring home strays. If we'd
taken in all those dogs and cats,

25:42.290 --> 25:45.876
we wouldn't have had any money
to feed the children in this house.

25:46.836 --> 25:49.547
Your heart is large.

25:50.632 --> 25:55.678
Just take care that others don't take
advantage of it. I'd hate to see that.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.888
All right, Mama.

25:58.848 --> 26:03.060
My daddy took me to a bar when I was 12
and told me to pick my whiskey.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.312
There was all these bottles
behind the bar.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.983
I said "I'll take that one there
with the pretty turkey on it."

26:10.026 --> 26:14.738
The guys in the bar laughed their butts
off. We got drunk as coots that night.

26:14.906 --> 26:18.742
My daddy was a good man.
Sharecropper. Hard worker.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.412
That's the one thing I got from him -
workin' hands.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.999
- How old were you when he died?
- 14.

26:28.086 --> 26:31.463
- Why's you a nun?
- I was drawn to it, I guess.

26:31.631 --> 26:36.176
That's a hard question to answer. It's
like asking you why you're a convict.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.095
- Bad luck.
- Good luck, then.

26:38.263 --> 26:43.809
I had a lovin' family, a lot of support.
I felt obliged to give some of it back.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.978
Don't you miss havin' a man?

26:46.146 --> 26:48.731
Don't you wanna get married,
fall in love, have sex?

26:52.819 --> 26:54.403
You don't wanna talk about it?

26:55.363 --> 26:57.990
I have close friends - men and women.

26:58.158 --> 27:02.911
I've never experienced sexual intimacy,
but there's other ways of being close.

27:03.079 --> 27:06.498
Sharing your dreams,
your thoughts, your feelings.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.876
That's bein' intimate too.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.754
We got intimacy right now,
don't we, Sister?

27:14.758 --> 27:17.217
I went to see your mother.

27:17.385 --> 27:23.307
She said she'd appear at the pardon
board hearing if you want her to.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.062
I like bein' alone with you.

27:28.229 --> 27:30.272
You're lookin' real good to me.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.776
Look at you.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.945
Death is breathin' down your neck

27:37.113 --> 27:39.948
and you're playin' your little
man-on-the-make games.

27:40.909 --> 27:45.412
I'm not here for your amusement,
Matthew. Show some respect.

27:45.580 --> 27:48.707
Why should I respect you?
Cos you're a nun and you wear a cross?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.960
Because I'm a person.
Every person deserves respect.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.262
What's it gonna be with your mama?

28:03.723 --> 28:08.977
Mattie had a hard life,
but he was a good boy.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.981
When he was six, he...

28:15.944 --> 28:17.027
he...

28:32.419 --> 28:34.420
Ladies and gentlemen, let's be honest.

28:34.587 --> 28:37.631
You're not gonna find
many rich people on death row.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.718
Matthew Poncelet's here today
because he's poor.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.805
Didn't have money for representation,
so he took what the State gave him.

28:44.973 --> 28:49.393
A tax lawyer who'd never tried
a capital case before. An amateur.

28:50.145 --> 28:54.440
The jury selection took four hours.
The trial lasted five days.

28:54.607 --> 28:59.987
The lawyer raised one objection
the entire trial.

29:00.155 --> 29:04.158
Now, if Matthew had himself
some money,

29:04.325 --> 29:09.163
well, he could have hired
a team of crackerjack lawyers.

29:09.330 --> 29:14.126
They would have hired top-notch
investigators, a ballistics expert,

29:14.294 --> 29:18.338
a psychologist to compile
profiles of desirable jurors,

29:18.506 --> 29:24.303
and you can be sure Matthew Poncelet
wouldn't be here today, before you,

29:24.471 --> 29:27.514
asking for his life.

29:30.685 --> 29:35.147
The death penalty. It's nothing new.
Been with us for centuries.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.442
We've buried people alive,
lopped off their heads,

29:38.610 --> 29:41.361
burned them alive in public squares.

29:41.529 --> 29:44.281
I wanted them to see this picture.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.325
In this century, we've searched

29:46.493 --> 29:51.413
for more and more humane ways
of killing people we didn't like.

29:51.581 --> 29:55.375
We've shot 'em with firing squads,
suffocated 'em in a gas chamber.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.878
But now...

29:58.046 --> 30:03.884
Now we have developed a device
that is the most humane of all.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.178
Lethal injection.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.472
We strap the guy up.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.560
We anaesthetize him with shot No. 1.
Then shot No. 2 implodes his lungs

30:13.728 --> 30:17.523
and shot No. 3 stops his heart.

30:17.690 --> 30:21.193
We put him to death
just like an old horse.

30:21.361 --> 30:26.907
His face just goes to sleep. Inside, his
organs are going through Armageddon.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.535
The muscles of his face
would twist and contort and pull,

30:29.702 --> 30:34.748
but you see, shot No. 1 relaxes those
muscles so we don't see any horror show.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.751
We don't have to taste
the blood of revenge on our lips,

30:37.919 --> 30:43.090
while this human being's organs
writhe, twist, contort.

30:43.800 --> 30:49.638
We just sit there quietly, nod our
heads, and say "Justice has been done."

30:52.308 --> 30:58.272
It is six years since the brutal murders
of Hope Percy and Walter Delacroix.

30:58.439 --> 31:01.483
Justice is long past due.

31:01.651 --> 31:05.028
Matt Poncelet has had
a lengthy, thorough court review.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.531
A trial, a retrial for sentencin',

31:07.699 --> 31:10.576
numerous appeals to
state and federal courts

31:10.743 --> 31:13.620
and successive petitions
filed by Mr. Barber.

31:13.788 --> 31:18.709
There has been no doubt in the court's
mind about who did the murder.

31:20.712 --> 31:25.090
Matthew Poncelet is not a good boy.
He is a heartless killer.

31:25.258 --> 31:29.303
These murders were calculated,
disgusting and cruel.

31:29.846 --> 31:34.099
This man shot Walter Delacroix
two times in the back of his head,

31:34.267 --> 31:36.852
then raped Hope Percy
and stabbed her 17 times

31:37.020 --> 31:40.397
before shootin' this sweet girl
two times in the back of the head.

31:41.733 --> 31:46.695
These families will never see
their children graduate from college.

31:47.989 --> 31:50.616
They will never attend their wedding.

31:50.783 --> 31:53.911
They will never have Christmas
with them again.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.163
There will be no grandchildren.

31:56.331 --> 32:02.085
All they ask of you is simple justice
for their unbearable loss.

32:02.754 --> 32:07.174
I ask you to take a breath,
steel your spine

32:07.342 --> 32:11.845
and proceed with the execution
of Matthew Poncelet.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.351
It's always a good sign
when you have to wait.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.979
- I don't know if we made any headway.
- I thought you did great.

32:21.147 --> 32:24.232
Best thing would be if they
realized their own culpability

32:24.400 --> 32:25.525
in the death of a man.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.195
- Hilton.
- Excuse me, Sister.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.326
I'm Walter Delacroix's father.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.162
Mr. Delacroix,
I'm sorry about your son.

32:37.330 --> 32:40.040
Sister, I'm a Catholic.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.501
How can you sit by Poncelet's side

32:42.669 --> 32:45.087
without ever coming
to visit with me and my wife

32:45.254 --> 32:47.297
or the Percys to hear our side?

32:47.465 --> 32:50.884
How can you spend all your time
worryin' about Poncelet

32:51.052 --> 32:54.304
and not think that maybe
we needed you too?

32:54.472 --> 32:59.559
Mr. Delacroix... I didn't think
that you wanted to... talk to me.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.645
Earl, are you goin' in?

33:01.813 --> 33:04.231
This is Mary Beth and Clyde Percy.

33:04.399 --> 33:09.027
- I'm sorry about your daughter.
- Yeah. So are we. Excuse us.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.741
Listen, Sister.

33:14.909 --> 33:19.329
I'm sure you've seen a side of Matt
Poncelet that none of us has seen.

33:19.497 --> 33:23.583
I'm sure he's on his best behavior
and must be pretty sympathetic to you.

33:23.751 --> 33:27.546
But, Sister, this is an evil man.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.674
This is a man
who abducted teenage kids

33:30.842 --> 33:33.927
and raped... and killed them.

33:34.095 --> 33:38.265
That scum robbed me of my only son.

33:38.433 --> 33:42.394
My name... my family name dies with me.

33:42.562 --> 33:47.190
There will be no more Delacroixs,
Sister. No more.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.277
I want you to know I do care
about you and your family

33:50.445 --> 33:52.904
and what happened to your son.

33:53.072 --> 33:57.784
I'm gonna give you my number and
if there's anything that you need,

33:57.952 --> 34:00.537
- you just call me.
- Me call you?

34:02.582 --> 34:07.878
Think about that, Sister.
Think about how arrogant that is.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.130
Excuse me.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.594
You all right?

34:17.513 --> 34:19.639
We better be gettin' on in.

34:33.780 --> 34:39.326
It is the finding of this board that
clemency be denied to Matthew Poncelet.

34:39.494 --> 34:43.830
Execution will be carried out
as scheduled one week hence.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.498
Don't give up hope, Matt.

34:45.666 --> 34:49.252
We still got a judge
that can put a stop to this.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.588
Then there's the US Supreme Court
and the governor.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.466
I'll get a private meeting.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.052
You're all I got, Sis.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.346
They tell me I can have
a spiritual adviser of my choice.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.264
Will you do it?

35:03.559 --> 35:05.936
Ride along into the sunset with me.

35:10.149 --> 35:14.694
You're gonna have to spend several hours
with him every day as his death nears.

35:14.862 --> 35:19.574
And on the day of his execution you're
gonna have to spend all day with him.

35:20.576 --> 35:22.202
It's not an easy job.

35:22.370 --> 35:27.040
Usually it's done by a chaplain
or a priest or a Muslim cleric.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.503
I want you to be realistic about this.

35:31.671 --> 35:36.258
We've got about a one in 1,000 chance
things might go our way.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.301
It's a tough road.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.686
If that had been a king,
you could have gone back over again.

35:47.854 --> 35:51.565
You can jump three this way,
then go all the way back.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.985
She got that big old bad joker
and she don't wanna put it down.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.071
All right. My turn. My turn.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.782
I got an ace. I'm really lucky.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.743
Whose was this?

36:04.370 --> 36:05.704
Oh, please don't kill him.

36:05.872 --> 36:09.541
He's a child of God.
He's a poet, blah, blah, blah.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.044
Attention all ye advocates
of killers and child molesters,

36:13.212 --> 36:15.130
ye opponents of execution.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.716
Ye cannot walk upon the high ground.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.844
Ye do not have
the moral authority to walk there.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.763
Ye traverse with scum
and scum is where ye...

36:38.237 --> 36:39.321
What do you want?

36:39.488 --> 36:41.573
Mr. Delacroix,
forgive me for intrudin',

36:41.741 --> 36:44.910
but I haven't been able to get
you and your wife out of my mind.

36:45.077 --> 36:49.289
I've been tryin' to call you
but there's been no answer.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.458
Can I please speak with you?

36:52.418 --> 36:53.418
Sure.

36:58.257 --> 37:02.427
I'm really sorry for not comin' to visit
with you and your wife before this.

37:02.595 --> 37:07.474
But... I've never been involved
in anything like this before.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.434
Truth is you're scared.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.979
Yes.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.565
I'd be too.

37:17.151 --> 37:19.569
- Come in.
- Thank you.

37:22.782 --> 37:26.910
Sister... Can I ask you a question?

37:29.163 --> 37:32.832
- Are you a communist?
- Communist? No.

37:34.168 --> 37:39.172
That's what some people are sayin'
with you defendin' this murderer.

37:39.340 --> 37:43.677
But I didn't think so. Sit down.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.553
Thank you.

37:50.685 --> 37:54.229
- Care for some coffee?
- Thank you.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.108
Sorry about the mess.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.363
My wife and I had a big fight.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.865
When we got back from the hearing,

38:06.033 --> 38:10.328
she... took Walter's clothes
out of his closet.

38:10.496 --> 38:14.708
Put 'em in boxes. Called Goodwill.

38:16.002 --> 38:20.005
She says she wants to
put the past behind her.

38:20.172 --> 38:24.509
She says she...
has to move on in her life.

38:26.637 --> 38:31.016
- She's not herself.
- That must be so hard.

38:32.351 --> 38:37.856
When it first happened, she had me bring
her to Walter's grave every morning.

38:40.192 --> 38:42.027
She wept a river, poor woman.

38:42.903 --> 38:47.324
Whole days, nights... for weeks, months.

38:48.909 --> 38:54.914
I wish there was some way,
some key into the past, to change it.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.919
It tears me up.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.009
She used to be a ball.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.639
We would have us
some fun, boy.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.851
Some times.

39:17.271 --> 39:21.191
Laugh... Laugh our heads off.

39:33.537 --> 39:37.791
Walter learned to walk
on this floor right here.

39:45.174 --> 39:48.635
He bust his chin on the arm
of that sofa right there.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.391
In that love seat right there,

39:56.060 --> 40:01.481
he sat with Hope...
the week before they died.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.533
When you lose a child

40:11.700 --> 40:15.787
all the memories,
get sealed in a place.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.665
Sealed.

40:20.543 --> 40:24.129
Like a... shrine.

40:36.976 --> 40:42.230
So, you've put in a request to be the
spiritual adviser to Matthew Poncelet.

40:42.398 --> 40:43.356
Yes, Father.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.860
- Why?
- He asked me.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.279
This is highly unusual.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.032
- Why?
- You would be the first woman to do it.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.409
Really?

40:54.577 --> 40:58.288
This kind of situation
requires an experienced hand.

40:58.456 --> 41:03.668
This boy is to be executed in six days
and is in dire need of redemption.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.796
Are you up to this?

41:07.882 --> 41:12.177
I don't know, Father. I hope so.
I've been prayin' for guidance.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.929
You can save this boy

41:15.097 --> 41:19.559
by getting him to receive the
sacraments of the Church before he dies.

41:19.727 --> 41:24.230
This is your job.
Nothing more, nothing less.

41:25.649 --> 41:29.819
If you need any help,
please feel free to call on me.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.446
Thank you, Father.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.742
I don't wanna be buried here.

41:35.910 --> 41:39.204
They said they'd call Mama and
ask her about the funeral arrangements.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.581
Could you do that?
She'd fall apart on 'em.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.374
I'll do it.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.173
You ever read the Bible?

41:50.341 --> 41:51.341
Yes, ma'am.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.594
I ain't much of a Bible reader,
but I pick it up from time to time.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.263
Like WC Fields read his Bible.

41:57.431 --> 41:59.265
- Who?
- WC Fields.

41:59.433 --> 42:01.601
Played this drunken character
in the movies.

42:01.769 --> 42:05.855
He's on his deathbed and a friend
comes and sees him readin' the Bible.

42:06.023 --> 42:11.277
The friend says "WC, you don't believe
in God. Why are you reading the Bible?"

42:11.445 --> 42:15.657
And Fields says
"I'm lookin' for a loophole."

42:20.287 --> 42:22.747
I ain't lookin' for no loophole.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.668
Rain, rain, rain.

42:27.378 --> 42:31.673
That's a bad sign. They already
executed one black - Tobias.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.301
Wayne Purcell tonight.
That's two blacks.

42:36.637 --> 42:40.473
Time for a white. The governor's
under pressure to get a white.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.433
And that's me!

42:43.936 --> 42:48.147
Nigger on the gurney before me. I hope
they clean it before they put me on it.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.819
Was your daddy a racist?

42:52.987 --> 42:56.823
- What kind of question is that?
- You have to teach a child to hate.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.659
- I just don't like niggers.
- Have you known any black people?

42:59.827 --> 43:02.996
They was all around when I was a kid.
Lived around me.

43:03.163 --> 43:07.166
- Did you ever play with a black child?
- No. Me and my cousin got jumped once.

43:07.334 --> 43:10.003
- What happened?
- We was throwin' rocks at 'em.

43:10.170 --> 43:13.590
Next day they wait their chance,
get ahold of our bikes, tear 'em up.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.675
- Can you blame 'em?
- No.

43:15.843 --> 43:19.762
But slavery's long over. They always
sayin' what a bad deal they got.

43:19.930 --> 43:23.725
- The kids that tore up your bike?
- I can't stand people who are victims.

43:23.892 --> 43:25.977
- Victims.
- Yeah. They all victims.

43:26.145 --> 43:30.607
I don't know any victims in my area.
I know some decent, hard-workin' people.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.943
I know a lot of lazy coloreds
suckin' up tax dollars.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.696
- You sound like a politician.
- What's that mean?

43:36.864 --> 43:40.700
- You ever been the object of prejudice?
- No.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.494
What do people think about
inmates on death row?

43:43.662 --> 43:45.872
- Why don't you tell me?
- They're all monsters.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.459
Disposable human waste
suckin' up tax dollars.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.711
They gonna kill me. I'm innocent.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.548
I ain't whinin'. I ain't sittin' on no
porch going "Slavery, slavery."

43:55.716 --> 44:00.803
I like rebels. Martin Luther King,
he led his people all the way to DC.

44:00.971 --> 44:04.057
- You respect Martin Luther King?
- He put up a fight, wasn't lazy.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.808
- What about lazy whites?
- Don't like 'em.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.311
So it's lazy people you don't like.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.647
Can we talk about somethin' else?

44:24.953 --> 44:28.456
Jesus also said "He who lives
by the sword shall die by the sword."

44:28.624 --> 44:31.250
Purcell had it coming to him.
He had it coming!

44:31.418 --> 44:35.463
Nine, eight, seven, six,

44:35.631 --> 44:38.800
five, four, three,

44:38.967 --> 44:41.427
two, one.

44:50.896 --> 44:54.232
It's the only way we can be sure
that they will not kill again.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.693
Life without parole. Oh, sure!

44:56.860 --> 45:00.822
How many prison guards and prisoners
do they have to kill before it's over?

45:00.989 --> 45:05.284
These people are mad dogs. Maniacs.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.037
Come on. Let's go.

45:13.961 --> 45:17.213
If the governor and the courts
turn us down,

45:17.381 --> 45:20.675
Matt's gonna be dead in six days.

45:22.469 --> 45:27.265
We gotta get us a funeral home
and... someplace to bury him.

45:28.559 --> 45:32.186
Maybe our sisters will donate
one of their burial plots.

45:32.354 --> 45:34.272
Somebody to do the burial service.

45:34.440 --> 45:38.151
Clothes. I guess... a suit.

45:38.318 --> 45:39.944
A suit?

45:41.989 --> 45:44.741
What size suit do you think he wears?

45:45.909 --> 45:47.702
I don't know.

45:49.329 --> 45:51.038
How tall is he?

45:53.167 --> 45:56.627
I don't know. I think he's... kinda big.

45:56.795 --> 46:02.467
What... size is kinda big?
Does it run like big, medium and petite?

46:08.348 --> 46:12.143
Well, I don't know.
I never bought a man's suit before.

46:13.270 --> 46:18.524
Won't you be a pretty sight?
A nun shoppin' for a man's suit!

46:21.236 --> 46:26.032
I'm out of my league.
This is so surreal.

46:29.286 --> 46:32.371
Hope had just graduated
from high school in early May.

46:32.539 --> 46:37.168
She was to join the air force
on June 15th.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.170
That's the day it happened.

46:39.338 --> 46:41.672
She almost got out of Slidell.

46:41.840 --> 46:44.675
She was hopin'
to get stationed overseas.

46:44.843 --> 46:50.598
She liked to travel and loved being
around people of different cultures.

46:51.725 --> 46:56.479
On June 15th, the recruiting sergeant
was to meet Hope in Slidell

46:56.647 --> 46:59.899
and drive her to Baton Rouge
for induction.

47:00.067 --> 47:03.486
The day before I took her shoppin'
for things she'd need.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.155
You know, just practical things.

47:07.157 --> 47:11.077
That evening about five, she dressed
and headed off to work at Coreys

47:11.245 --> 47:13.204
where she waitressed.

47:13.372 --> 47:16.415
After work she had a date with Walter.

47:17.125 --> 47:23.089
As she was about to leave, the hem
of her skirt was comin' out and I...

47:24.007 --> 47:26.342
She was in such a hurry, so...

47:26.510 --> 47:30.429
I pinned it for her with one
of those tiny safety pins

47:30.597 --> 47:33.599
and she was gone, out the door.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.227
You don't know, when
you see your child leave,

47:36.395 --> 47:40.314
that you're never gonna
see them alive again.

47:41.525 --> 47:43.901
If I'd known that,

47:44.945 --> 47:48.072
I would have told her
how much I love her.

47:48.615 --> 47:51.450
You know, my last words to her,

47:51.618 --> 47:54.745
the last that
she ever heard from me,

47:54.913 --> 47:58.040
were about the hem of her skirt.

48:00.294 --> 48:03.212
Next morning we waited for her
to come out of that door.

48:04.756 --> 48:07.592
This was Hope's big day.

48:07.759 --> 48:10.261
Our baby was leavin' home.

48:10.429 --> 48:16.142
Her room was empty
and the bed was still neatly made.

48:16.310 --> 48:19.937
So I telephoned the Delacroixs.

48:20.105 --> 48:25.276
Our hearts sank when they told us that
Walter hadn't come home that night too.

48:25.444 --> 48:29.113
And then for one brief moment
we thought, well,

48:30.949 --> 48:33.618
maybe they'd run off
and gotten married or somethin'.

48:34.369 --> 48:39.332
But we knew that she was
just too sensible a girl to do that.

48:39.499 --> 48:43.377
I went down to the police
and filled out a missing person's form.

48:44.379 --> 48:48.841
Three days later,
the sheriff formed a search party.

48:49.384 --> 48:52.345
- I went along with 'em.
- They were gone all day.

48:52.512 --> 48:55.348
They just walked for miles and nothin'.

48:55.515 --> 48:58.559
On Thursday, June 20th,

48:58.727 --> 49:03.856
some kids were walking near
Flank's Cove and they found a purse,

49:04.024 --> 49:07.985
some clothing and a wallet.
They turned them in to the police.

49:08.904 --> 49:14.909
They found the kids' bodies on Friday,
six days after they'd gone missin'.

49:16.828 --> 49:22.541
My daughter's body
was nude, legs spread-eagled.

49:23.293 --> 49:27.755
The coroner's report said that
her vagina was all tore up.

49:29.716 --> 49:32.635
At first they couldn't find
this class pin she was wearin'

49:32.803 --> 49:37.223
cos it was embedded so deep
from the stabbin'.

49:38.725 --> 49:43.896
She loved that pin. She was so proud
of it. She wore it all the time.

49:44.064 --> 49:48.567
It said "Class of '88.
Making a difference."

49:50.070 --> 49:53.197
The police wouldn't
let us identify the body.

49:53.365 --> 49:56.158
They said it would be too traumatic.

49:56.326 --> 50:02.123
I just couldn't bear the thought
of them buryin' that body

50:02.290 --> 50:06.919
without makin' absolutely and
positively sure that that was Hope.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.588
So I called my brother. He's a dentist.

50:09.756 --> 50:14.844
I asked him to go to the funeral home
and make an ID from dental records.

50:15.762 --> 50:20.683
Before he'd stuck his hand into
that bag with all that lime in it

50:20.851 --> 50:24.186
and fished Hope's jaw out,

50:24.354 --> 50:27.690
he'd been against the death penalty.

50:27.858 --> 50:31.485
And after that he was all for it.

50:31.653 --> 50:35.531
I knew it had to be Hope.

50:35.699 --> 50:40.745
That's what my mind told me,
you know, but I... just had to be sure.

50:53.008 --> 50:56.927
OK. This is Sister Helen Prejean.

50:57.095 --> 51:00.014
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, Emily.

51:00.807 --> 51:02.433
OK?

51:03.143 --> 51:07.271
OK. Let's go in the kitchen.
I'll make us some coffee.

51:17.115 --> 51:21.410
I met Poncelet face to face
in the hallway during the trial.

51:21.578 --> 51:23.746
I ain't gonna get no chair, Daddy.

51:23.914 --> 51:27.458
You're gonna fry.
And I'm gonna watch you sizzle.

51:28.460 --> 51:31.504
There was a sheriff
standin' pretty close by me.

51:31.671 --> 51:35.841
I could have grabbed his gun.
I could have shot Poncelet right there.

51:36.009 --> 51:40.012
I could have killed him on that day.
I wished I would have.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.432
I'd be a happier man today.

51:47.187 --> 51:50.106
So what made you change your mind?

51:50.273 --> 51:54.360
- Change my mind?
- What made you come round to our side?

52:02.702 --> 52:05.204
I just... wanted to come and see

52:05.372 --> 52:09.041
if I could help y'all and pray with you.

52:09.209 --> 52:10.751
Thank you.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.088
But...

52:17.384 --> 52:22.388
He asked me to be his spiritual adviser,
to be with him when he dies.

52:22.556 --> 52:25.015
And what did you say?

52:26.476 --> 52:28.310
That I would.

52:29.396 --> 52:31.480
We thought you'd changed your mind.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.358
We thought that's why you were here.

52:37.946 --> 52:39.655
No.

52:42.659 --> 52:45.911
- How can you come here?
- How can you do that?

52:46.079 --> 52:49.248
How can you sit with that scum?

52:49.416 --> 52:53.085
Mr. Percy, I've never
done this before. I'm...

52:53.253 --> 52:55.546
I'm tryin'...

52:56.590 --> 53:00.593
I'm just tryin' to follow
the example of Jesus,

53:00.760 --> 53:06.640
who said that every person
is worth more than their worst act.

53:06.808 --> 53:10.186
This is not a person. This is an animal.

53:10.353 --> 53:14.398
No, I take that back. Animals don't
rape and murder their own kind.

53:14.566 --> 53:18.277
Matthew Poncelet is God's mistake.

53:18.445 --> 53:22.656
And you want to hold
the poor murderer's hand?

53:22.824 --> 53:25.409
You wanna be there
to comfort him when he dies?

53:25.577 --> 53:28.287
There wasn't anybody
in the woods to comfort Hope

53:28.455 --> 53:31.874
when those two animals pushed her
face down into the wet grass!

53:32.042 --> 53:36.879
I just wanna help him
take responsibility for what he did.

53:37.047 --> 53:40.591
Does he admit to what he did?
Is he sorry?

53:40.759 --> 53:45.471
- He says he didn't kill anybody.
- Sister, you're in way over your head.

53:45.639 --> 53:49.016
You don't know what it's like
to carry a child and give birth

53:49.184 --> 53:53.145
and get up with a sick child
in the middle of the night.

53:53.313 --> 53:55.773
You say your prayers
and get a good night's sleep.

53:55.941 --> 53:59.235
My parents raised me
to respect the religious.

53:59.402 --> 54:02.404
Sister, I think you need
to leave this house right now.

54:03.615 --> 54:05.366
I'm sorry.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.326
Wait a minute.

54:07.494 --> 54:11.747
If you really are sorry and you
really do care about this family,

54:11.915 --> 54:14.500
you'd wanna see justice done
for our murdered child.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.794
You can't have it both ways.

54:16.962 --> 54:20.673
You can't befriend that murderer
and expect to be our friend too.

54:20.840 --> 54:24.635
You brought the enemy
into this house, Sister. You gotta go.

54:36.231 --> 54:39.900
I come from a good family.
My family can't be blamed for nothin'.

54:40.068 --> 54:43.153
I had two families.
Both of 'em I'd live and die for.

54:43.321 --> 54:47.408
- Your other family is?
- The family of man. Of men in prison.

54:47.575 --> 54:49.702
My white family, the Aryan brotherhood.

54:49.869 --> 54:52.538
You're a white supremacist,
a follower of Hitler?

54:52.706 --> 54:55.708
Hitler was a leader. I admire him
for gettin' things done.

54:55.875 --> 55:00.129
Like Castro. Hitler might have gone
overboard with the killin' stuff,

55:00.297 --> 55:02.673
but he was on the right track
about the Aryan race.

55:02.841 --> 55:05.384
The right track?
The murder of six million Jews?

55:05.552 --> 55:06.552
That's never been proven.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.680
What am I doin' with this guy?
I'm nuts.

55:11.141 --> 55:14.560
...political assassination
of Castro, Allende, Sandinistas...

55:16.104 --> 55:17.938
The government shouldn't...

55:18.106 --> 55:20.274
- Hello?
- Sister? Hilton Barber.

55:20.442 --> 55:23.527
We need you to come in
for a strategy meeting.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.530
In the Shreveport Times,

55:26.698 --> 55:29.408
Poncelet says that if he
had to do it all over again,

55:29.576 --> 55:35.497
he would do something useful like
bombing government buildings.

55:35.665 --> 55:38.167
We must get him off
this political prisoner kick.

55:38.335 --> 55:41.253
Henry, how close are we
on the supreme court docket?

55:41.421 --> 55:44.548
- A couple of days.
- We don't have a couple of days!

55:44.716 --> 55:47.926
- We don't have the legal staff, Hilton.
- You've had it three days.

55:48.094 --> 55:51.930
- Where were you yesterday anyway?
- I had to take my kid to the dentist.

55:52.098 --> 55:53.932
A man's gonna die on death row and...

55:54.100 --> 55:56.352
My kid needed to
hold her daddy's hand.

55:56.519 --> 56:01.190
If you don't like it, find another
lawyer to volunteer his time.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.449
People are thinkin'
you're some kind of a nut.

56:10.617 --> 56:14.787
Admirin' Hitler and wantin' to come back
as a terrorist and blow people up!

56:14.954 --> 56:17.581
I didn't say people.
Government buildings, not people.

56:17.749 --> 56:20.042
How can you bomb a building
without hurtin' somebody?

56:20.210 --> 56:22.836
I ain't got no love
for the US government.

56:23.004 --> 56:27.049
You're a fool. You are makin' it
so easy for them to kill you.

56:27.217 --> 56:32.471
Comin' across as a crazed, animal, Nazi,
racist, mad dog who deserves to die.

56:32.639 --> 56:33.847
Is that what you think?

56:34.015 --> 56:36.058
You are makin' it
so difficult to help you.

56:36.226 --> 56:38.977
- You can leave.
- I'm not gonna do that.

56:40.897 --> 56:43.857
It's up to you.
You want me to go, you say so.

56:51.324 --> 56:53.575
Do you ever think about those kids?

56:53.743 --> 56:55.702
It's terrible what
happened to them kids.

56:55.870 --> 56:57.996
It didn't have to happen.

56:58.164 --> 57:01.708
Do you ever think about what
you and Vitello did to their parents?

57:01.876 --> 57:05.170
It's hard to have sympathy for them
when they want to kill me.

57:05.338 --> 57:10.092
Well, think about it.
Their kids are shot, stabbed, raped,

57:10.260 --> 57:13.095
left in the woods to die alone.

57:13.263 --> 57:16.432
What if it happened to your mama
or your little brother?

57:16.599 --> 57:20.060
- What would you wanna do to them?
- I'd sure as hell wanna kill 'em.

57:20.228 --> 57:23.730
I understand them parents,
but they callin' for the wrong head.

57:23.898 --> 57:25.983
- I wanna take a lie detector test.
- What?

57:26.151 --> 57:31.572
It won't change their minds, but I want
my mama to know I didn't kill any kids.

57:40.165 --> 57:42.166
Boy, that's good.

57:47.005 --> 57:50.966
Hey, y'all! Havin' a party! Palmer.

57:51.134 --> 57:54.470
- Herbie, how's your side feelin'?
- OK.

57:54.637 --> 57:56.597
- Kenitra, how are you doin'?
- Fine.

57:56.764 --> 58:00.267
- Come on, Kenitra. Let's go.
- Bye-bye.

58:02.437 --> 58:04.104
Wait a minute. What happened?

58:06.107 --> 58:08.275
There's talk in the neighborhood.

58:08.443 --> 58:12.571
Someone read some of Poncelet's racist
comments. Your name was in the article.

58:12.739 --> 58:15.073
Oh, Lord.

58:15.241 --> 58:17.326
You haven't been at the learning centre.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.829
They think you care more
about him than your classes.

58:23.416 --> 58:27.377
- Colleen, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. I still love you.

58:28.087 --> 58:29.421
I just thought you should know.

58:30.507 --> 58:31.882
Oh!

58:33.343 --> 58:35.010
I got this at Goodwill.

58:38.348 --> 58:42.726
I talked to Bishop Norwich.
He said he would say the funeral mass.

58:43.561 --> 58:47.356
I also found a funeral home
willing to donate their services.

58:47.524 --> 58:52.069
The leaders of the congregation met and
we can use one of our own burial plots.

58:52.779 --> 58:57.366
If Matt dies, guess who
he'll be buried next to.

58:57.534 --> 59:00.536
- Who was the last person to die?
- Sister Celestine.

59:02.121 --> 59:03.205
Oh, Lord.

59:03.373 --> 59:07.459
Remember when that sweet little girl
came to introduce her husband to us?

59:07.627 --> 59:11.463
Sister Celestine said "I'm glad I'll
never have to share my bed with a man."

59:11.631 --> 59:14.800
- She loved her celibacy so much.
- I know.

59:14.968 --> 59:19.388
She's gonna be lyin' next to a man
for all eternity.

59:36.406 --> 59:40.409
My daughter's killer can possibly
get out on parole in another year.

59:41.536 --> 59:43.662
He's only served six.

59:45.415 --> 59:48.166
I can't bear the thought
of him bein' a free man

59:48.334 --> 59:52.296
and her buried in the ground
and dead for ever.

59:53.631 --> 59:57.301
...was killed by her ex-husband.

59:57.468 --> 01:00:02.764
...stabbed to death
in our backyard by my son's best friend.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.349
He'd spent the night at our house

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:07.686
and gone to church with us
that very morning.

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:10.564
I've just lost my child.

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:18.780
When our child was killed,
it took over a week to find her body.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:24.202
The DA's office treated us
like we were the criminals.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:29.583
My wife...
filed for divorce this afternoon.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:36.965
We just have different ways
of dealing with our son's death.

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.554
"Until death do us part."

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:47.142
We're nothin' special.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:50.562
Most folks that lose a kid split up.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.357
70% or somethin'.

01:00:53.524 --> 01:00:56.777
I just wish I could laugh,
find somethin' funny.

01:00:58.529 --> 01:01:00.238
This is my car.

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:04.409
Thanks for invitin' me, Mr. Delacroix.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:08.288
You take care, Sister.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:02.342
What the fuck you doin'? What you doin'?

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.880
Raise your arms.

01:02:44.051 --> 01:02:45.427
Go ahead.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.682
Have a seat in that chair.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.204
Like my new digs?

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.707
Hi.

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:21.379
I'm pretty special.

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:25.258
I'm pretty special.
Have this place all to myself.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.347
They got ten guards guardin' me.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:34.726
Got one guy that comes down every 15
minutes just to see if I killed myself.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:37.229
Suicide watch.

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:43.401
Never had so many people
carin' about what I was doin'.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.571
When did they bring you here?

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:49.699
Last night. Late.

01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:53.662
Didn't say goodbye to most of the guys
on the row. They were asleep.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.248
Did you take care of
that lie detector test yet?

01:03:56.415 --> 01:04:00.252
I made some calls,
but I haven't had any luck yet.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.926
So this is the end, huh?
My death-house vacation.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:11.721
Three days of quiet.
Plenty of time to read my Bible.

01:04:11.889 --> 01:04:17.269
Look for a loophole.

01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:25.569
Did you read anythin'
about Jesus in that Bible?

01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:33.285
Uh... Holy man. Did good. In heaven.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:35.495
Praise Jesus.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:40.041
There are some passages in there

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:43.753
about when Jesus was facin' death
alone that you might wanna check out.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:47.257
I think me and Jesus have
a different way of dealin' with things.

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.968
He's one of them
turn-the-other-cheek guys.

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:55.265
It takes a lot of strength
to turn the other cheek.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:58.435
You say you like rebels.
What do you think Jesus was?

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.813
- He wasn't no rebel.
- Sure he was. He was a dangerous man.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:05.734
- Why is "love your brother" dangerous?
- Because his love changed things.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.737
His love changed things.

01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:13.325
All those people nobody cared about -
prostitutes, beggars, the poor...

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:16.328
...they finally had somebody
who respected them, loved them.

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:19.831
Made 'em realize their own worth.

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:24.878
They were becomin' so powerful that
the guys on the top got real nervous

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:27.839
and so they had to kill Jesus.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:30.425
Kinda like me, huh?

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:36.765
No, Matt... Not at all like you.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:41.061
Jesus changed the world with his love.
You watched while two kids were killed.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:45.649
Step back from the door, Sister!

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.151
Why? What's happenin'?

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:58.078
- Move it on out, boy.
- Well, Sister... What's this?

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:04.501
He'll be an hour, Sister.
Why don't you get some air?

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:07.170
- Where are they takin' him?
- I can't tell you.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:25.021
Sister Helen? Chaplain Farley called.
He's at the gate. He'll be right here.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:26.398
Thank you.

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:30.735
Sergeant Trapp, how long do you think
that big old tree's been there?

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:34.906
Ma'am, ain't no tellin'.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:39.744
Saw you outside the gates
the other night at Purcell's execution.

01:06:39.912 --> 01:06:41.329
Yeah.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.249
- You seemed upset.
- Upset? No.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:48.378
- Were you in the room when they did it?
- I'm on the strap-down team.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:51.423
Left leg. That's my job. The left leg.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:54.759
We take the prisoner from his cell
to the execution chamber.

01:06:54.927 --> 01:07:00.807
- Wow. That's gotta be tough.
- It's hard. I didn't sleep that night.

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:04.686
I think it's gotta affect
everybody that sees it,

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.563
whether they're for it or against it.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:11.526
It's just part of the job. These
prisoners get what's comin' to 'em.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:16.906
It's easy for someone to come in here
and make a rash judgment on procedure.

01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:21.494
What may appear on the surface
to be irrational or unnecessary

01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:27.125
proves upon examination to have solid
reasoning and experience behind it.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:31.129
Father, all I want is to play a hymn
for Matt before his execution.

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:34.883
And experience tells us
that music stirs up emotion.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:39.637
Emotion that can produce
an unexpected reaction in the inmate.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:44.684
All right. Do you have any objection
to my asking the warden for his opinion?

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:50.356
I would oppose it,
but you may if you like.

01:07:51.525 --> 01:07:54.110
Thank you. And thank you for your time.

01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:58.323
I understand you were protesting outside
the gates during the last execution.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.908
Yes.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:04.662
Are you familiar with the Old Testament?
"Thou shalt not kill."

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:09.751
"If anyone sheds the blood of man,
by man shall his blood be shed."

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:15.715
Yes, Father. In the New Testament, Jesus
talks about grace and reconciliation.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:20.095
Poncelet has to understand
that Jesus died for his sins.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:21.513
If he accepts that,

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.643
reconciliation is his and
his soul shall have eternal life.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:31.022
One's opinion of the death penalty
is not the issue here.

01:08:31.732 --> 01:08:37.194
Look at Romans. "Let every person be
subordinate to the higher authorities.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.948
For there is no authority
except from God.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:45.703
And those who oppose it
will bring judgment upon themselves."

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.456
- What is it?
- She collapsed in my office.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:51.376
- She's havin' a heart attack.
- I'm OK. I just fainted.

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.962
I just need something to eat.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:05.598
Could you tell Matt
what happened, please?

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:09.018
- When we're finished here.
- No, I've gotta tell him now.

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:11.854
- I'll take care of it, Sister.
- Thank you.

01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:15.649
- Good news. This isn't a heart attack.
- I'm just hungry.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:20.697
They don't let visitors eat in the death
house. They must think we feed on air.

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:25.785
Is that the machine
they use after an execution?

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:29.956
Yes, ma'am. Just have to be
official about the whole thing.

01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:34.377
Thank God we're off the electric chair.
It's easier to take the needle.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:38.131
Just part of the job, you know. Let's
get you up and put some food in you.

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:39.966
Who puts the needle in?

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.426
That's private information.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.179
Is it you?

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:49.767
We're not allowed to disclose any
specifics regardin' execution procedure.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.814
Sister, let me get you some food.
Then we'll send you home.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.942
- I gotta get back to Matt.
- I'm sorry, Sister.

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:01.112
This is warden's orders.
You're through for the day.

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:10.038
Where'd you go yesterday? You all right?
I asked what happened. Nobody'd tell me.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.916
You didn't know?
They told me they'd tell you...

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:16.002
They took me into that little room.
They was measurin' me...

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.588
- Measuring you?
- See how big a coffin I needed.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:21.674
Then I come back and you were gone.
I spent the day alone.

01:10:21.842 --> 01:10:24.135
Oh, Matt. I'm sorry.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.306
I'm so sorry.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.439
- You ever get lonely?
- Yeah, sure.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:46.741
Sometimes on Sundays when I smell
the neighborhood barbecues

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:52.330
and I hear all the kids laughin'
and I'm sittin' in my room,

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.165
I feel like a fool.

01:10:58.003 --> 01:11:02.173
What I miss most bein' here are women.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:06.928
You know, I used to sit at the bar,
just drinkin' and listenin' to music.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.681
I'd dance till
three or four in the morning.

01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:12.183
I ain't gonna lie.
I believe in doin' it.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:15.061
Me and my lady friends,
we'd grab a bottle, some weed...

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.356
...go out in the woods and we'd do it.

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:20.525
It's somethin' you miss, ma'am.

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:23.528
Let's face it.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.864
If I had a husband and family, chances
are I'd be with them right now

01:11:27.032 --> 01:11:30.868
- instead of here visitin' with you.
- Yeah, true enough.

01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:32.787
I'm glad you're here.

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:40.920
Do you want me to get a message
to your daughter?

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.387
Let her be.

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:55.476
Those things'll kill ya.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.066
I ain't gonna let 'em break me.

01:12:03.902 --> 01:12:06.571
I just pray God holds up my legs
on that last walk.

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:09.407
It's the wait, it's the countdown
that gets to you.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:14.579
We're gonna know soon
about the federal appeal.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:18.291
And Hilton and I are meeting
with the governor this evening.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.711
Fat chance he's gonna do anything.
Risk his political butt for me?

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:25.423
I wish I hadn't said all that shit
about Hitler and bein' a terrorist.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.467
Stupid!

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.597
Hartman says there won't be
any more media interviews.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.768
Good. Keep my stupid mouth shut.

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:44.442
I arranged for a lie detector test
for tomorrow morning.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.903
All right. There is some good news.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:50.448
The man that's giving
the test has serious doubts

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:52.492
that they'll get an accurate result.

01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:55.411
- Why?
- Tomorrow's the day of your execution.

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:59.457
You'll be under stress and the test
can mistake stress for dishonesty.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.751
No problem. I'm home free.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.881
You been readin' your Bible?

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:10.968
I tried to last night.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.846
Makes me wanna sleep.

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.182
I'm tryin' to stay conscious.

01:13:21.271 --> 01:13:24.107
I appreciate you tryin' to save me.

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:27.777
Me and God, we got
our thing squared away.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:31.614
I know Jesus died on the cross for us,
and he's gonna take care of me

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.033
when I appear before God
on Judgment Day.

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:41.999
Redemption isn't a free admission ticket
you get because Jesus paid the price.

01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:47.505
You gotta participate in your own
redemption. You got some work to do.

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:52.510
I think you should look at the Gospel of
John, chapter eight, where Jesus said,

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:58.641
"You shall know the truth,
and the truth shall make you free."

01:14:00.894 --> 01:14:05.773
I'll check it out. I like that. "The
truth shall make you free." I like that.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:09.819
So I pass that lie detector test,
I'm home free.

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:12.864
Matt...

01:14:14.741 --> 01:14:19.704
If you do die... as your friend,
I wanna help you die with dignity.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:22.498
You can't do that unless you own up...

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:25.960
...to the part you played
in Walter and Hope's death.

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.898
Hilton Barber, Bishop Norwich.

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.484
Pleasure, Bishop. Here's the situation.

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:53.905
Governor Benedict is a reluctant
supporter of capital punishment.

01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:57.366
He has the power to stop this execution
and save a man's life.

01:14:57.534 --> 01:15:00.244
It's the last vestige
of the divine right of kings.

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:03.623
The trick is that we have to appeal
to him on a personal level,

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:05.208
without any fanfare.

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.418
That's why this is a private meeting.

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:10.171
You must understand that,
in representing the State,

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:15.927
I must carry out the laws and must
submerge my own personal views

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:20.097
to carry out the will of the people.
I'll look carefully at this case.

01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:25.436
But unless there's some clear,
striking evidence for innocence,

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:28.231
I will not interfere with the process.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:33.194
We still got the court, Sister.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:37.323
We might hit pay dirt
on one of the legal issues.

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:45.289
Helen!
Helen, come to dinner!

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:51.462
You're looking for a love
that's so big, it takes in all evil.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:56.008
Annunciations are common.
Incarnations are rare.

01:15:56.176 --> 01:15:58.219
You're not a saint, Helen.

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:06.477
Helen. Helen.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.646
Helen.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.399
- Helen.
- Oh, Mama.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:17.530
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yes. I was just dreamin'.

01:16:19.032 --> 01:16:22.618
- What time do you have to be there?
- Nine sharp.

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:26.247
- Did you set a clock?
- Yeah.

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:30.543
Oh... It's so bizarre.

01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:35.840
A man's gonna be killed
in front of me tomorrow.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:41.345
- Has he admitted anything?
- Oh, no.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:47.184
He's so full of hate.
He doesn't trust anybody. He just...

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.895
He keeps pushin' me away.

01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:54.275
You're in deep water, kid.

01:16:56.236 --> 01:16:59.363
Do you remember
when you gave me a black eye?

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:04.201
- I had a fever.
- You were delirious, hysterical.

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:08.122
You were trying to get up
and run into the street.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:13.711
You socked me in the eye
and you said you hated me.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:16.964
You screamed, but I held you.
I held you tight.

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:22.345
Cos a mother's arms are strong
when her child's in danger.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:43.282
I didn't sleep at all last night.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:47.578
I didn't take that nerve medicine
they wanted to give me.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.415
I'm lookin' death in the eyes.
I'm gettin' ready to go.

01:17:56.963 --> 01:18:02.510
Listen, Matt, I want you to know
that I respect your need for privacy.

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:06.931
If you wanna be alone,
or be just with your family today,

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:08.766
I understand. I won't be offended.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:11.102
You should be there, ma'am.

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:14.063
I'm gonna want somebody to talk to,
be there till the end.

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:15.898
I'll be there.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:22.947
If only I knew I would die right away
with the first shot. Will I feel it?

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.163
The lungs go first.

01:18:31.331 --> 01:18:35.626
Like a... fast choke.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:39.797
That's gotta hurt.

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:48.139
They say that, uh...
the body doesn't move.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.767
Doesn't shake.

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:01.360
My poor mama.

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.993
Any word from the Fifth Circuit?

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.328
None yet. That's a good sign.

01:19:11.496 --> 01:19:15.791
They've had it a good while. Maybe that
means they see something substantive.

01:19:15.959 --> 01:19:19.670
- I gotta go. I'll call you later.
- Thanks, Hilton.

01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.884
Tell me somethin', Sister.

01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:28.512
What is a nun doin'
in a place like this?

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.848
Shouldn't you be teachin' children?

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:33.517
Do you know what this man has done?

01:19:33.685 --> 01:19:35.478
How he killed them kids?

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:39.857
What he did was evil.
I don't condone it.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:43.110
I just don't see the sense in killing
people to say killing's wrong.

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:45.738
You know how the Bible says
an eye for an eye?

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.491
The Bible also asks
for death as a punishment

01:19:48.658 --> 01:19:51.327
for adultery,
prostitution, homosexuality,

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:55.623
trespass upon sacred ground, profaning
the Sabbath and contempt of parents.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:59.126
I ain't gonna get into no Bible quotin'
with no nun, cos I'm gonna lose.

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:13.724
She was only on the phone a few minutes

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:17.478
and she was fallin'
for the old Matt charm.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:21.565
I had to take back that phone.
You were tryin' to steal my gal.

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:24.568
- You dog!
- She sounds like a great little gal.

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:26.737
She ain't so little, though.

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.283
You take care of her, Craig.
Don't do nothin' stupid.

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:35.663
She looks a bit like... What was
that girlfriend you had in high school?

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.915
I had lots of girls in high school.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:40.918
- The one with the funny name.
- Funny name?

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:42.920
Maddie... Maldy. Maldy?

01:20:44.589 --> 01:20:46.799
- Madrigal.
- Madrigal. Madrigal.

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:49.718
Madrigal Parmelee. Oh, she was hot!

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:53.430
- She was a nasty little thing!
- Matthew.

01:20:53.598 --> 01:20:56.350
Sorry, Mama. She was a fine,
upstanding young woman.

01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:04.817
How about you, Troy?
Got yourself a little girlfriend?

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:06.277
No.

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:08.487
- Why not?
- Ain't got time.

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.614
Too much fishin' and campin' to do.

01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:13.784
- Troy just got a new tent.
- What kinda tent you got?

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:17.037
Army tent. Not like them
sissy ones with all them colors.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:20.082
- Tell Matt about the other night.
- Campin' in the backyard.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.669
I made him come in. I was worried.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:26.171
I went out there
and I made him come in.

01:21:26.339 --> 01:21:27.882
Mama, that ain't what happened.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.885
- Go on. Tell him.
- Come on.

01:21:33.096 --> 01:21:37.099
Me and my buddy Paul put up the tent,
cooked our own dinner.

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:41.896
We roasted potatoes in tinfoil on the
fire and cooked us some weenies.

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.148
Then what? Go on.

01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:48.736
- About midnight...
- About nine o'clock, I think.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.947
- We heard some kinda animal.
- What kinda animal?

01:21:52.115 --> 01:21:53.240
It was big.

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:55.743
- Was it a bunny?
- A possum?

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.912
- Was it a squirrel?
- Was it a mouse?

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:03.292
- Shut up! It was big and nasty.
- Look me in the eye, little man.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.629
Did you go in cos Mama told you to
or cos you were scared?

01:22:06.796 --> 01:22:08.464
Now tell the truth.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.802
Look me in the eye.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.015
We got him!

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:26.190
Some people ask about your funeral.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:29.276
I get real angry and say
"He's not dead yet."

01:23:25.625 --> 01:23:29.211
- Sorry, folks. We have to wrap this up.
- It's early, isn't it?

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:31.422
Rules say they can stay till 6:45.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:37.386
It's time for you folks
to be leavin' now.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.452
- Here you go, Poncelet.
- Thanks, man.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.204
I got my stuff in these pillowcases.

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.081
I'd like it if y'all
took it home with you.

01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:10.252
I don't want the prison sendin' it.
Craig, you can divide up the stuff.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.506
Except my boots from Marion. I want
to walk to my execution in these boots.

01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:16.592
Up on your feet.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.636
Y'all say your goodbyes now.

01:24:38.114 --> 01:24:40.324
See you later, Matt.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:47.456
- Bye.
- No goodbyes, little man.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:51.001
- No, ma'am.
- Can't she hug him?

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:55.172
I'm sorry, Sister. Security reasons.

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:06.600
Don't cry, Mama.
I don't wanna see no cryin'.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.103
I'm not sayin' goodbye now.

01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:13.065
- I'll call you tonight.
- See you, Matt. Stay strong.

01:25:14.567 --> 01:25:16.401
Don't cry, Mama. I'll call you later.

01:25:17.862 --> 01:25:19.738
We love you, Mattie.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:32.918
If I'd put my arms around my boy,
I'd never have let go.

01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:46.890
Is my mama all right?!

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:49.935
She's fine, Matt.

01:25:52.063 --> 01:25:53.897
All right. Goodbye.

01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:04.908
I never had shrimp before.
They're pretty good.

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:12.082
So what did he say? What's the word
on the lie detector test?

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.837
Your answers showed stress,
as predicted

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:19.339
and the results were inconclusive.

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:25.012
Man... Was the dude sure?
Absolutely, positively sure?

01:26:27.807 --> 01:26:31.768
I felt all right answerin' them
questions. I didn't feel no stress.

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:34.730
I can't believe I failed it.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:38.275
You'd have to be a robot or insane
not to feel stress now.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.903
I can't believe that test
didn't come out right.

01:26:45.074 --> 01:26:49.286
Let's talk about what happened.
Let's talk about that night.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.747
I don't wanna talk about that.

01:27:23.613 --> 01:27:25.322
- Get outta the car.
- Hey, you're a pretty bunny.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.659
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.160
Let's go.

01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:32.162
You're under arrest.
Step outta the car.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.331
We'll just leave. We didn't know...

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:36.458
Get outta the car!

01:27:36.834 --> 01:27:39.795
- Where are we going?
- There's a little bar back here.

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:43.090
- Our boss is in the bar.
- We can't let you go. You been bad.

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:46.051
- Our boss is gonna be pissed.
- Maybe he'll let you go.

01:27:47.053 --> 01:27:51.014
Well, here we are. This is the bar.

01:27:51.182 --> 01:27:53.350
- Can we get you a drink?
- Kneel down.

01:27:54.185 --> 01:27:55.435
I'm pissed off!

01:27:55.603 --> 01:28:00.315
Pissed off at them kids. Pissed off
at their parents comin' to see me die.

01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:02.693
Pissed off at myself
for lettin' Vitello do it.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:06.196
I got my last words. I know what to say
to the Percys and the Delacroixs.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:08.532
Your last words
will be words of hatred?

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.159
Clyde Percy wants
to inject me hisself!

01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:13.870
Think of how angry he must be.

01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:16.540
He's never gonna see his daughter again.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.876
Never hold her, love her,
laugh with her.

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:25.007
You've robbed these parents of so much.
They have nothin' but sorrow. No joy.

01:28:25.174 --> 01:28:26.758
That is what you have given them.

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:35.392
- What possessed you to be in the woods?
- I told ya. I was stoned outta my head.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.397
You were harassing couples for weeks
before this happened. Months!

01:28:42.233 --> 01:28:45.152
- What was it?
- What do you mean?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.655
Did you look up to Vitello?
Did you think he was cool?

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:51.199
Did you wanna impress him?

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:53.744
I don't know.

01:28:53.911 --> 01:28:57.205
- You could have just walked away.
- He went psycho on me.

01:28:57.373 --> 01:29:00.250
Don't blame him. You blame him,
the government, drugs.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:03.628
You blame blacks, the Percys,
the kids for bein' there!

01:29:03.796 --> 01:29:06.381
What about Matthew Poncelet
in this story?

01:29:06.549 --> 01:29:09.051
What is he? Just an innocent? A victim?

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.269
I ain't no victim.

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:29.112
Poncelet.

01:29:33.409 --> 01:29:37.204
The federal appeals court
turned you down.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.289
I'm sorry.

01:29:48.549 --> 01:29:50.801
Sister, please step into the corridor.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.388
I'll be right outside.

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:06.650
- Matt?
- Yeah.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.950
- I'm sorry, son. I feel like I failed.
- No, you didn't fail. You didn't.

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:17.911
I appreciate everythin'
you and the others done for me.

01:30:18.996 --> 01:30:23.166
- What is she typin'?
- The forms for the witnesses to sign.

01:30:24.502 --> 01:30:25.669
You didn't fail.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:28.922
The justice system in this country
failed me. It stinks bad.

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.675
I'm gonna head out there right now.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:47.274
Oh, God, help me.
This is such a terrifyin' place, Lord.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:50.819
So cold. So calculated, this murder.

01:30:50.987 --> 01:30:53.113
Just don't let him fall apart, God.

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:58.702
Help him stay strong. Help me, Jesus,
stay strong. Help us, Lord.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:02.873
Help us stay strong. Help me.

01:31:23.936 --> 01:31:26.396
They shaved the calf of my leg.

01:31:29.358 --> 01:31:30.817
Why?

01:31:31.235 --> 01:31:33.904
I guess they was worried
they wouldn't find a vein in my arm.

01:31:36.365 --> 01:31:38.492
What's that number?

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.161
I put it on there when I was in Marion.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:44.706
In case somebody killed me,
they could identify my body.

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.048
Did it hurt when you got all those?

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:58.678
You seein' these tattoos,
you're gonna think I'm a bad person.

01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:04.476
Nah, you just have more color
on your body than I thought.

01:32:12.276 --> 01:32:14.402
Tried to give me two shots.

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:18.365
- A sedative and an antihistamine.
- Antihistamine?

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:20.450
Yeah.

01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:24.955
If I had an allergic reaction

01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:28.041
to the first shot that knocks you out,
it gets messy.

01:32:31.754 --> 01:32:33.797
Somethin' I wanna give you.

01:32:38.511 --> 01:32:39.761
My Bible.

01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:42.973
I dated it myself.

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:45.767
Hey...

01:32:47.478 --> 01:32:49.437
Thanks, Matt.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.608
Step back from the cell, Sister.

01:32:56.654 --> 01:32:58.488
Time to call home.

01:33:00.032 --> 01:33:01.741
Will you stay?

01:33:02.868 --> 01:33:06.246
I'll stay.
I'll just give you some privacy.

01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:15.338
Hey, man.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.051
You know what I'm doin'.
What are you doin'?

01:33:20.219 --> 01:33:24.723
Yeah. It... The time's tickin' away.

01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:28.518
Hey! What you doin' grabbing the phone?

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:30.687
Gonna sleep in that tent tonight?

01:33:32.481 --> 01:33:35.066
Hey, Mama. I'm waitin' to talk to you.

01:33:35.234 --> 01:33:38.361
Don't cry, Mama. Don't cry.

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:41.031
Don't cry.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:50.373
That's not what it was, Mama.
That's not what it was.

01:33:50.541 --> 01:33:54.836
I was... I was small.

01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:01.426
It had nothin' to do with that guy.

01:34:03.679 --> 01:34:06.139
Yeah, I can hear him.
Let me talk to him.

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:10.393
Hey, Troy. You take care of Mama, OK?
All right, little man?

01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:12.520
You take care of Mama.

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.608
Mama? Mama?

01:34:18.235 --> 01:34:22.530
I love you, Mama.
I love you, Mama.

01:34:25.034 --> 01:34:27.202
I just let it flow.

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:29.579
Told my mama I loved her.

01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:34.668
Talked to each of the boys.
I hate saying goodbye.

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:38.588
I just told 'em, if I get a chance,
I'd call right before I go.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:44.427
What, Matt? What is it?

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:49.516
My mama said it was that Vitello.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:52.769
She'd always regret
that I got involved with him.

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:57.107
I didn't want her thinkin' that.

01:34:58.109 --> 01:35:01.653
It was somethin' that you said.
I coulda walked away.

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:05.031
I didn't.

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.162
I was a victim.

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:15.625
I was a fuckin' chicken.

01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:18.128
He was older and tough as hell.

01:35:18.295 --> 01:35:23.007
I was just... boozin' up, tryin'
to be as tough as him. I couldn't...

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:27.095
I didn't have the guts
to stand up to him.

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:33.143
I told my mama I was yellow.

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:40.650
She kept sayin' "It wasn't you, Matt.
It wasn't you. It wasn't you."

01:35:43.154 --> 01:35:45.405
Your mama loves you, Matt.

01:35:47.491 --> 01:35:49.492
That boy...

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:54.539
Walter.

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:56.541
Yeah?

01:36:01.213 --> 01:36:03.173
What?

01:36:05.050 --> 01:36:06.593
I killed him.

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:17.020
- And Hope?
- No, ma'am.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:20.690
Did you rape her?

01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:26.196
Yes, ma'am.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.368
Do you take responsibility
for both of their deaths?

01:36:32.536 --> 01:36:34.245
Yes, ma'am.

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:40.001
When the lights dimmed last night, I
kneeled down and I prayed for them kids.

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:42.086
I never done that before.

01:36:42.254 --> 01:36:44.547
Oh, Matt...

01:36:46.926 --> 01:36:50.303
There are spaces of sorrow
only God can touch.

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:53.515
You did a terrible thing, Matt.
A terrible thing.

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:58.561
But you have a dignity now.
Nobody can take that from you.

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:03.316
You are a son of God, Matthew Poncelet.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.747
Nobody ever called me
no son of God before.

01:37:18.749 --> 01:37:22.418
Called me a son of you-know-whats
a lot of times. Never no son of God.

01:37:23.462 --> 01:37:26.381
I just hope my death can give
them parents some relief.

01:37:26.549 --> 01:37:30.301
Maybe the best thing you can give
to the Percys and the Delacroixs

01:37:30.469 --> 01:37:32.720
is a wish for their peace.

01:37:32.888 --> 01:37:35.431
You know, I never had
no real love myself.

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:40.270
Never loved a woman
or anybody else much good.

01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:46.943
It figures I'd have to die to find love.

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.453
Thank you for lovin' me.

01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:13.136

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:16.931
I'm really cold.

01:38:17.099 --> 01:38:20.226
Can he have a jacket or somethin'?
He's cold.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:28.151
What happened to that song
you were gonna play for me?

01:38:28.319 --> 01:38:30.320
- The hymn?
- Uh-huh.

01:38:30.487 --> 01:38:33.907
They have a rule you can't
have music in the prison.

01:38:34.491 --> 01:38:36.659
So they won't let me play it.

01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:40.663
Well, you know the words.
You could sing it.

01:38:40.831 --> 01:38:42.832

- That's OK.

I don't have your faith.

It's not faith.
I wish it were that easy.
