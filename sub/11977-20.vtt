00:03.520 --> 00:05.255
Previously on Rogue...

00:05.256 --> 00:06.723
You stick with this girl,

00:06.724 --> 00:08.191
and you're gonna wind up dead.

00:08.192 --> 00:10.326
Mia was behind the short
selling of the mine.

00:10.327 --> 00:12.462
She read the auditor's report.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.998
The auditor whose plane
crashed mysteriously?

00:14.999 --> 00:16.332
Whatever.

00:16.332 --> 00:18.868
- How you feelin'?
- Like I slept in a ditch.

00:18.869 --> 00:20.470
It was more of a gully than a ditch.

00:20.471 --> 00:22.472
I need you to look into
something for me, Jen.

00:22.473 --> 00:24.340
Her name's Anna Drubeskaya.

00:24.341 --> 00:26.609
- Marlon.
- Famous.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.944
Where's my package?

00:29.413 --> 00:32.011
Yo, 5-0, man. Fucking set me up!

00:32.046 --> 00:33.283
Mr. Dinard,

00:33.284 --> 00:35.685
you're the embodiment of everything
that is wrong in this city.

00:35.686 --> 00:37.688
I can't have that around my kid.

00:38.489 --> 00:39.956
The Russians found us, ma'am.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.625
- What do they want?
- Half a million dollars.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.161
This is a list of undeclared donations,

00:45.162 --> 00:48.765
violations of almost every
campaign finance law on the books.

00:48.766 --> 00:50.767
- What do you have in mind?
- I was thinking

00:50.768 --> 00:54.637
that I would be appointed to the
District Court of the state of Illinois.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.105
I'll get you your fucking money.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.840
Two seconds ago you didn't
have my fucking money.

00:57.841 --> 01:00.510
Two seconds ago I didn't have
a fucking gun stuck in my ear!

01:00.511 --> 01:01.868
You already have my money?

01:01.903 --> 01:05.447
No, but actually, you got ours, you fat
Russian. Fuck you, you piece of shit!

01:05.449 --> 01:07.050
What I said in that courtroom...

01:08.652 --> 01:10.653
All we need to do is get
ready for Ethan Kelly.

01:10.654 --> 01:11.988
Excuse me?

02:06.443 --> 02:08.978
Found something?

02:08.979 --> 02:12.983
Yeah. Looks like our girl's led
quite the exciting little life.

02:13.917 --> 02:15.786
Jesus.

02:18.188 --> 02:22.592
Anna Drubeskaya's connected
to at least four murders.

02:22.593 --> 02:24.995
And not charged, not even once?

02:26.864 --> 02:28.465
Keep reading.

02:29.533 --> 02:32.735
Now, wait a minute, this can't be right.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.936
That's what I thought.

02:33.937 --> 02:36.873
She was murdered in
Moscow two years ago?

02:36.874 --> 02:38.741
- Allegedly.
- What the hell's going on?

02:38.742 --> 02:40.476
I have no idea at all.

02:40.477 --> 02:42.612
Seems a bit surreal.

02:42.613 --> 02:44.480
I got a couple of broken ribs.

02:44.481 --> 02:47.817
There's a pain in the
gut every time I breathe.

02:47.818 --> 02:49.285
So, surrealism is the last thing

02:49.286 --> 02:51.554
- I'm feeling right now.
- Most men

02:51.555 --> 02:54.757
down-play their injuries
so they sound tougher.

02:54.758 --> 02:58.762
Most men are taller than me,
but I compensate in other ways.

03:06.503 --> 03:08.505
So what're we thinking?

03:08.639 --> 03:10.373
Um...

03:11.708 --> 03:13.443
I'm gonna talk to Lowry in the morning.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.978
Maybe we can use her to get to Marty.

03:15.979 --> 03:18.248
Here we go again.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.986
Did you see Furnell's press conference?

03:23.987 --> 03:26.790
Sucking up to Stein.
Son-of-a-bitch.

03:27.191 --> 03:29.326
It's a rare thing of beauty.

03:30.928 --> 03:33.997
- What is?
- Your stubbornness.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.134
I like to think of it as perseverance.

03:41.472 --> 03:44.807
- Are we done here?
- Wow, a few weeks back at CPD,

03:44.808 --> 03:47.759
you already forget what
actual case work feels like.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.346
I got, uh... Since the thing,

03:49.347 --> 03:53.747
I've got Lily calling me every 15
minutes to see if I've been kidnapped.

03:55.219 --> 03:57.220
Well then, you better get home.

04:03.627 --> 04:06.830
For the record, it's three broken ribs.

04:07.898 --> 04:09.232
Tough guy.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.768
Better believe it.

04:31.522 --> 04:32.989
It's a bad idea?

04:36.059 --> 04:37.527
It's a bad idea.

05:01.952 --> 05:04.087
Ow. It's okay.

05:04.755 --> 05:06.489
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:06.490 --> 05:08.357
- Tough guy?
- Yeah. Tough guy.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.904
Bets. Shit.

05:22.639 --> 05:24.908
Hold on a second!

05:32.649 --> 05:34.917
You're opening doors
yourself these days?

05:34.918 --> 05:37.587
Yeah, well, Betsy left me.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.589
Because you left her for dead?

05:39.590 --> 05:42.125
Something like that. Come on in.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.595
Sit down. You want something to eat?

05:45.596 --> 05:46.929
No, no, no. I ate already.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.798
Mind if I?

05:48.799 --> 05:50.533
It's your house.

05:53.737 --> 05:54.937
Mia's not with you?

05:54.938 --> 05:56.406
No.

05:57.341 --> 05:58.808
Why?

06:00.010 --> 06:02.011
Sure you don't want something to eat?

06:02.012 --> 06:03.746
As good as that looks, I'm all right.

06:03.747 --> 06:05.881
- Hearty healthy.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:05.882 --> 06:08.284
I thought about your proposition.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.553
- Oh?
- I'm in.

06:10.554 --> 06:13.889
We figure out the drive
and, uh, we cut her loose.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.491
I think you're making
the right decision.

06:15.492 --> 06:18.428
Well, like you said,
better the devil I know.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.897
She's not just going to
walk away. You know that.

06:21.898 --> 06:23.099
I'm aware of that. Yeah.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.300
What are you gonna do with her?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.036
Why don't you let me deal with that?

06:30.574 --> 06:34.443
God I hate this shit. Betsy
made me eat it every morning.

06:34.444 --> 06:36.979
Just so you know, Mia
came to me last night

06:36.980 --> 06:38.581
with a little proposition.

06:38.582 --> 06:40.049
- Oh, yeah?
- Me, her

06:40.050 --> 06:41.917
and the drive.

06:41.918 --> 06:44.053
"All we need to do is
get rid of Ethan Kelly."

06:44.054 --> 06:47.257
That's a direct quote.

06:48.058 --> 06:49.926
What'd you say?

06:50.727 --> 06:52.329
I said, "I'll think about it."

06:53.514 --> 06:56.065
I bet you did.

06:56.066 --> 06:58.067
I'm telling you this so
you can watch your back.

06:58.068 --> 07:00.870
No, you're telling me this
so I can do your dirty work.

07:00.871 --> 07:02.605
- That, too.
- Yeah.

07:04.474 --> 07:06.075
She's bad news, Ethan.
We both know that.

07:06.076 --> 07:09.545
I'm gonna tell you something.
When we're all done with this,

07:09.546 --> 07:11.948
if you don't get rid of her, I will.

07:16.219 --> 07:18.755
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to go

07:19.823 --> 07:22.358
cook myself up some bacon and eggs.

07:47.317 --> 07:48.918
- What's good, y'all?
- Yeah?

07:48.919 --> 07:50.808
I'm looking for Cook.
Y'all know where he at?

07:50.843 --> 07:51.988
Who the fuck are you?

07:55.192 --> 07:58.795
All right. Just tell him the
chandelier man is here. All right?

07:59.329 --> 08:01.064
Chandelier man.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.014
- Wait here.
- All right.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.398
Come in.

08:41.905 --> 08:43.773
Marlon Dinard.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.175
What's good, Cook?

08:46.176 --> 08:49.378
What are you doing in a dump like this?

08:49.379 --> 08:51.647
- I'm looking for work, homeboy.
- Oh, yeah?

08:51.648 --> 08:53.516
- Yeah.
- How's your hemming?

08:54.718 --> 08:56.452
Thought you was out the game.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.454
Circumstances change, man.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.456
Oh, yeah? 'Cause I heard
it was you that changed.

09:00.724 --> 09:02.458
What do you mean?

09:02.459 --> 09:04.994
I mean, a little birdy told me that
you've been running with the Feds.

09:04.995 --> 09:06.729
Nah.

09:06.730 --> 09:08.597
Nah, I... I ain't been
running with nobody, man.

09:08.598 --> 09:11.267
Well, Famous got his self eight
to ten on account of that "nobody".

09:11.268 --> 09:12.601
Famous?

09:12.602 --> 09:14.909
Famous is a dumb mother...
Don't put his shit on me.

09:14.944 --> 09:18.207
Well, Intelligence ain't got nothing
to do with it. That boy was set up.

09:18.208 --> 09:20.834
I got hauled in on the same shit he did.

09:20.869 --> 09:23.279
Yeah, then you were hauled out with
nothing but a slap on the wrist.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.815
I guess I got a better lawyer, bro.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.550
Uh-huh.

09:31.890 --> 09:33.531
What do you want?

09:35.959 --> 09:37.560
Hear about Judge Parker?

09:37.561 --> 09:42.231
That racist, white-power,
hold-the-nigga-down, piece of shit?

09:42.232 --> 09:44.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:44.901 --> 09:47.170
I heard karma caught up
with that motherfucker.

09:55.045 --> 09:56.912
God damn it!

09:56.913 --> 09:59.582
Did you... What the fuck
are you doing with that here?

09:59.583 --> 10:00.783
You still think I'm a snitch?

10:00.784 --> 10:02.251
I think you're insane!

10:02.252 --> 10:04.654
So, what's the going rate
for that these days, man?

10:09.192 --> 10:10.659
You know you're not the boss no more?

10:10.660 --> 10:12.394
Yeah, I know that.

10:12.395 --> 10:14.930
'Cause, you know, a nigga gets used
to a certain kind of lifestyle...

10:14.931 --> 10:17.200
Cook, look. That ain't
gonna be an issue, bro.

10:17.467 --> 10:18.801
Yeah?

10:30.814 --> 10:32.815
Fucker.

10:40.023 --> 10:42.158
You keep that with you.

10:42.826 --> 10:44.159
All right.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.096
And you burn that motherfucking wallet!

11:00.977 --> 11:02.578
Morning.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.847
Where have you been?

11:04.848 --> 11:07.116
What do you mean? I
went to go get you milk.

11:08.451 --> 11:10.720
And it took you that long?

11:11.788 --> 11:13.790
I went for a walk.

11:14.991 --> 11:17.927
You know, I woke up,
and you weren't here,

11:17.928 --> 11:20.330
- I was worried about you.
- Oh, yeah?

11:23.133 --> 11:25.401
Hey, what's going on with you?

11:25.402 --> 11:28.337
- Nothing's going on.
- Really?

11:28.338 --> 11:30.340
Why are you looking at me like that?

11:32.609 --> 11:35.144
Honestly, I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:36.212 --> 11:37.546
So he told you?

11:37.547 --> 11:39.015
What's that?

11:39.683 --> 11:41.284
Marty.

11:44.087 --> 11:45.822
He told you about me.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.698
My real name is Anna Drubeskaya.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.103
That's what you talked
to Jen about, right?

12:01.304 --> 12:04.374
That's why you had her do
a background check on me?

12:05.308 --> 12:08.911
You know, everything that
you read, it's bullshit!

12:08.912 --> 12:11.714
That's what they do, it's
how they discredit you.

12:11.715 --> 12:13.182
That's what who does?

12:14.117 --> 12:15.585
The Russian government.

12:15.719 --> 12:17.053
Hmm.

12:19.856 --> 12:23.059
My parents were
anti-government activists.

12:25.061 --> 12:28.798
They firebombed my
house when I was five.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.802
So we fled to America.

12:34.671 --> 12:39.075
And when they died, I decided to go
back and finish what they started.

12:41.211 --> 12:43.746
But you can't beat these people.

12:45.215 --> 12:46.816
You can't win.

12:48.952 --> 12:52.555
So, one day, I woke up and
realized what the world was.

12:53.623 --> 12:56.025
And I decided to take
back what was mine.

12:59.763 --> 13:01.364
They fake your death, too?

13:01.365 --> 13:03.765
No.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.368
I did that.

13:07.103 --> 13:08.838
I wanted to start over.

13:09.773 --> 13:12.041
Haven't you ever wanted
to just disappear,

13:12.042 --> 13:15.511
just run away from all
the bullshit in your life?

13:17.812 --> 13:20.512
Mia... Or Anna.

13:22.185 --> 13:23.786
Whatever you've done in your life,

13:23.787 --> 13:25.922
I guarantee you, I've done worse.

13:27.924 --> 13:30.192
You know, for a long
time, I was trying to

13:30.193 --> 13:32.995
hide from it, lie about it,

13:32.996 --> 13:35.397
but I've moved past that now.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.268
But if you can't be honest
with me, and tell me everything,

13:41.404 --> 13:42.871
then maybe we ought to just separate.

13:42.872 --> 13:44.207
Go our own ways.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.412
I want this to work between us.

13:53.817 --> 13:56.486
You don't have to decide now.

13:59.689 --> 14:01.023
Where are you going?

14:03.293 --> 14:05.828
I want you to take your
time. Think about what I said.

14:05.829 --> 14:07.563
You let me know.

14:18.641 --> 14:20.642
- Morning, Diaz.
- Morning.

14:20.643 --> 14:22.511
- What's with you?
- What?

14:22.512 --> 14:24.780
I don't know... You look happy.

14:26.116 --> 14:28.651
- I don't like it.
- Fuck you.

14:32.522 --> 14:34.256
Shit. Sorry, I didn't
know you had company.

14:34.257 --> 14:37.326
Actually, Deakins, these
gentlemen are here to see you.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.595
I'm Agent Johnson. This is Agent Clark.

14:39.996 --> 14:41.597
We're from the CIA.

14:41.598 --> 14:43.199
Close the door.

14:51.074 --> 14:52.275
Thank you.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.145
Beautiful morning, huh, Bob?

14:56.412 --> 14:58.013
Marty.

14:58.014 --> 15:00.949
- And a seat just happened to open up after all.
- Yeah.

15:00.950 --> 15:02.417
Lucky you.

15:02.418 --> 15:04.686
Lucky us, Senator.

15:04.687 --> 15:05.888
Don't think I'm gonna forget this

15:05.889 --> 15:08.424
come next election cycle.

15:09.626 --> 15:11.227
Marty, what the hell did you do?

15:11.761 --> 15:13.362
I'm sorry. What?

15:13.363 --> 15:15.497
You stood here in my
office not two days ago

15:15.498 --> 15:17.633
and assured me that
a spot would open up.

15:17.634 --> 15:20.435
Then the next morning, I read where
Judge Parker has just been shot

15:20.436 --> 15:22.437
in a random act of violence outside a...

15:22.438 --> 15:23.906
Outside a massage parlor.

15:23.907 --> 15:26.042
What exactly... Are you
accusing me of something?

15:27.377 --> 15:28.710
I'm not accusing you of anything, but...

15:28.711 --> 15:30.445
But what?

15:30.446 --> 15:33.649
You think I'm actually capable
of doing something like that?

15:33.650 --> 15:38.720
Murdering a sitting judge
to service my own agenda?

15:38.721 --> 15:41.791
I think there is very little
of which you are not capable.

15:43.526 --> 15:46.862
Wow! Look who's wearing
his big boy pants today.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.997
Let me tell you something.

15:48.998 --> 15:50.999
And I'm gonna say this once.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.404
I had nothing to do with
the death of Judge Parker.

15:55.405 --> 15:58.074
I swear on the life of my kids.

15:59.943 --> 16:02.345
You don't have any kids, Marty.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.681
Oh.

16:09.419 --> 16:11.821
Then I swear on the life of your kids.

16:18.895 --> 16:23.566
Let's not look a gift
horse in the mouth, Senator.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.036
Why don't you go back to work, Bob.

16:47.724 --> 16:50.125
Moved to Chicago when she was five.

16:50.126 --> 16:52.127
Her family naturalized a year later.

16:52.128 --> 16:55.330
When she was 13, her parents
were killed by a drunk driver.

16:55.331 --> 16:59.067
Went back to Russia to live with
her only remaining relative, an aunt.

16:59.068 --> 17:00.936
Graduated Lomonosov Moscow.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.938
Top of her class in computer science.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.539
- Computer science?
- Yeah. That's right.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.075
- So she's a programmer?
- Amongst other things.

17:07.076 --> 17:10.279
Recruited right out of school
by Russian Intelligence.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.414
Spends the next five years
training as an operative.

17:12.415 --> 17:16.151
- What kind of operative?
- We don't know the exact details of her training.

17:16.152 --> 17:18.420
But while working with
an American contractor,

17:18.421 --> 17:20.021
our Intel tells us

17:20.022 --> 17:23.358
she was able to gain access to
highly sensitive NSA infrastructure,

17:23.358 --> 17:26.560
which, in turn, the Russians used
to create a portal into our system.

17:26.561 --> 17:28.430
Wait, help me understand,
what's a portal?

17:28.431 --> 17:32.834
Basically, they created a program that
allows them access to NSA databases.

17:32.835 --> 17:34.703
- Jesus.
- Our own intelligence services

17:34.704 --> 17:38.840
caught wind of it and shut
it down. We believed...

17:38.841 --> 17:41.643
So, you're responsible for the
explosion that supposedly killed her?

17:41.644 --> 17:44.179
- The details are classified.
- Yeah. Of course, they are.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.315
We're only here because Agent Deakins

17:46.316 --> 17:49.651
entered a flagged search for Anna
Drubeskaya on a Federal database.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.721
That, in conjunction with the
sudden reappearance of Drubeskaya,

17:52.722 --> 17:55.791
leads us to believe that the
drive stolen from your Task Force

17:55.792 --> 17:57.660
is the drive we're looking for.

17:58.728 --> 18:00.329
Okay. So what do you need on our end?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.064
Well, of course, we want
to resolve this situation

18:02.065 --> 18:04.466
as quietly and quickly as possible.

18:04.467 --> 18:06.202
Our teams are already
working round the clock

18:06.203 --> 18:08.870
to find and close the loop,
rendering the drive useless.

18:08.871 --> 18:10.739
And why didn't you do that before?

18:10.740 --> 18:12.741
Until now, we didn't
know it was still open.

18:12.742 --> 18:14.876
We were hoping you might
have some insight into

18:14.877 --> 18:16.611
where we might find the drive

18:16.612 --> 18:17.679
or Drubeskaya.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.281
Preferably both.

18:19.282 --> 18:22.084
CIA can't make an arrest
on U.S. soil, right?

18:22.085 --> 18:23.418
Is that going to be a problem?

18:23.419 --> 18:24.886
Of course not.

18:24.887 --> 18:27.289
This Task Force will be
more than cooperative.

18:27.290 --> 18:29.531
The moment we learn about
Anna Drubeskaya's whereabouts,

18:29.566 --> 18:30.803
you'll be the first to know.

18:30.838 --> 18:32.494
Isn't that right, Agent Deakins?

18:32.495 --> 18:33.829
Absolutely, sir.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.831
Agents.

18:48.911 --> 18:50.912
You wanna make sure I stay happy?

18:50.913 --> 18:52.114
Is this a trick question?

18:52.115 --> 18:54.383
I need a trace on the
cell for Mia Rochlan,

18:54.384 --> 18:56.918
the one I gave you yesterday
from the Stein warrant.

18:56.919 --> 18:58.521
Yeah, I can do that.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.656
Deakins.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.932
What are you doing?

19:10.933 --> 19:13.468
- What?
- You know exactly what I'm asking.

19:13.469 --> 19:16.271
We will extend those
agents every cooperation.

19:16.272 --> 19:18.006
We will.

19:18.007 --> 19:19.864
I just want the first crack at her.

19:19.899 --> 19:21.209
Deakins...

19:21.210 --> 19:22.944
We go riding in with the cavalry,

19:22.945 --> 19:25.614
we're gonna spook this
girl, she's gonna clam up

19:25.615 --> 19:28.016
just long enough so no one
gets a chance to talk to her.

19:28.017 --> 19:29.451
You heard what they said.

19:29.486 --> 19:31.486
What I heard was every single agency's

19:31.487 --> 19:35.357
gonna want a crack at
her once we bring her in.

19:35.358 --> 19:36.558
This is my only shot.

19:36.559 --> 19:38.160
Your shot at what?

19:38.161 --> 19:40.295
She's going down for
treason and espionage.

19:40.296 --> 19:42.298
Yeah.

19:42.299 --> 19:44.566
And I wanna convince her to
bring Marty Stein down with her.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.636
Marty Stein. I knew it was about him.

19:48.571 --> 19:50.439
He's the one who got away.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.308
On our watch.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.244
Tell me you don't want him.

19:56.045 --> 19:57.646
Say it.

19:58.848 --> 20:00.982
Say it, and I'll let the whole thing go.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.585
They can have her.

20:06.189 --> 20:07.789
Just let me bring her in.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.058
Give me two hours with her.

20:10.059 --> 20:11.794
And then we'll hand her over.

20:12.195 --> 20:13.796
You have one.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.533
Thank you.

20:19.402 --> 20:21.403
Bring Agent Krause along as backup.

20:21.671 --> 20:23.539
You got it.

20:25.942 --> 20:27.275
Deaks,

20:27.276 --> 20:30.078
she's at 992, Moreno Avenue.

20:30.079 --> 20:32.214
That's Kelly's place.

20:33.282 --> 20:35.951
Krause, saddle up.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.827
Hi.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.162
Paddy, where are you?

20:47.163 --> 20:48.363
I'm working.

20:48.364 --> 20:49.698
You're missing all the fun.

20:49.699 --> 20:51.700
We're heading to pick
up Mia at Kelly's place.

20:52.235 --> 20:53.435
I'm on shift.

20:53.436 --> 20:55.437
Since when did you
give a shit about that?

20:55.438 --> 20:58.374
That is right. When
she's right, she's right.

21:25.601 --> 21:26.801
Federal Agents.

21:26.802 --> 21:28.671
Open up.

21:30.806 --> 21:32.141
One second.

21:46.522 --> 21:50.259
Agents Deakins, DEA,
this is Agent Krause, FBI.

21:51.193 --> 21:54.129
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Mr. Kelly's not home.

21:54.130 --> 21:56.264
Actually, we're not here to see Ethan.

21:56.265 --> 21:58.667
We have a warrant for your arrest.

21:58.668 --> 22:02.537
But it might be advantageous
to you if we talk here first.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.406
Uh, can I see that?

22:13.349 --> 22:15.084
Yeah.

22:20.022 --> 22:21.623
You guys want to sit down?

22:21.624 --> 22:23.625
No. You should.

22:25.895 --> 22:27.496
Okay.

22:30.299 --> 22:34.570
We know about you, Anna,
and we know about the drive.

22:37.239 --> 22:39.507
Okay, so what do you
want to talk about then?

22:39.508 --> 22:41.643
Marty Stein.

22:41.644 --> 22:43.111
Well, what about him?

22:43.112 --> 22:45.914
I want to know how he's involved.

22:48.317 --> 22:50.318
I mean... I... I don't know.

22:50.319 --> 22:52.721
We heard your conversation at the diner,

22:52.722 --> 22:55.924
about the drive, wanting
to get rid of Ethan.

22:57.126 --> 23:00.329
I want Marty Stein to
serve meaningful jail time.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.798
You can help me with that.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.335
And maybe I get can
help you avoid the chair.

23:13.409 --> 23:15.010
- Okay.
- Hey.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.080
Please sit.

23:27.156 --> 23:29.958
Well, do you want to see the
flash drive, or don't you?

23:30.760 --> 23:32.361
You're saying it's here?

23:33.162 --> 23:35.697
Yeah. It's in...

23:36.499 --> 23:38.366
Behind the island.

23:38.367 --> 23:39.968
First drawer.

23:41.437 --> 23:43.037
It's bullshit.

23:43.038 --> 23:45.841
Marty Stein has the drive.
We heard your conversation.

23:47.309 --> 23:49.444
Okay. Fine.

23:49.445 --> 23:51.713
You don't have to check
if you don't want to.

23:53.449 --> 23:56.518
That drive has
everything that you want

23:56.519 --> 23:58.387
on Marty Stein.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.668
Drop the gun!

24:14.270 --> 24:16.672
Drop the fucking gun!

24:19.074 --> 24:20.409
Drop it.

24:24.146 --> 24:25.747
Okay.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.482
Okay.

24:57.646 --> 25:00.315
Ethan, where are you?

25:36.218 --> 25:37.819
Deaks?

25:41.957 --> 25:44.626
Detective Finnegan! CPD!

25:44.627 --> 25:46.228
Patty...

25:47.429 --> 25:51.165
No, no, no, no.

25:51.166 --> 25:52.500
Hey! Hey!

25:52.501 --> 25:54.235
No, no.

25:54.236 --> 25:56.771
No.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.640
Hey! Hey! Hey! Can you talk?

25:58.641 --> 26:00.775
Can you talk? Fuck!

26:00.776 --> 26:02.911
Say something?

26:14.390 --> 26:16.124
Officer down!

26:16.125 --> 26:17.725
<i>- Officer down!
- Uh, what's your location?</i>

26:17.726 --> 26:21.195
992 Moreno Avenue,
Apartment... Apartment 1207!

26:21.196 --> 26:22.797
Jesus Christ! Officer down!

26:22.798 --> 26:25.066
<i>- EMT immediately. Hey!
- All right, all right.</i>

26:25.067 --> 26:27.335
<i>- EMT is on its way.
- Hey, hey, hey, no.</i>

26:27.336 --> 26:29.070
No, Harper. Hey, stay with me.

26:29.071 --> 26:31.205
Stay with me! Don't do this to me.

26:31.206 --> 26:33.875
Don't do this to me! Stay with me!

26:34.410 --> 26:36.545
Stay with me!

27:17.519 --> 27:19.748
- What's going on?
- Just drive.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.485
Do you want to tell me what's going on?

27:54.890 --> 27:57.558
The Feds know about the drive.

27:57.559 --> 27:59.561
How do you know that?

28:00.229 --> 28:01.696
The, um...

28:01.697 --> 28:04.632
Agent, the one that, um,
helped you get Jen back...

28:04.633 --> 28:06.234
Deakins. What about her?

28:06.235 --> 28:08.770
She stopped by with another agent

28:09.038 --> 28:10.639
to arrest me.

28:11.173 --> 28:12.641
For what?

28:13.175 --> 28:15.043
Everything.

28:15.844 --> 28:17.979
Ethan, they know everything.

28:19.982 --> 28:21.983
Then how are you sitting here?

28:23.585 --> 28:25.053
How?

28:28.257 --> 28:30.125
Jesus Christ.

28:32.261 --> 28:34.929
Ethan, I didn't have a choice. Okay?

28:34.930 --> 28:36.264
I was protecting myself.

28:36.265 --> 28:38.266
You would have done the same thing.

28:40.135 --> 28:42.137
Where's the body?

28:44.406 --> 28:46.274
Where's the fucking body at?

28:46.275 --> 28:47.641
It's in your apartment.

28:52.281 --> 28:53.615
Fuck!

28:54.636 --> 28:56.417
But I need you to
listen to me right now.

28:56.418 --> 28:59.754
There are two dead Federal
Agents in your apartment.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.758
What do you think they're gonna say?

29:03.759 --> 29:08.296
That a 115-pound girl got the
drop on them or an ex-Ranger?

29:15.504 --> 29:16.838
How long do we have?

29:17.106 --> 29:18.706
For what?

29:18.707 --> 29:21.909
Before the drive closes
how long do we have?

29:21.910 --> 29:25.379
Well, the encryption
will keep them out for a while,

29:25.380 --> 29:28.316
but they will find the
hole and they will close it.

29:28.317 --> 29:29.517
Ballpark?

29:29.518 --> 29:31.253
A day.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.522
Two days max.

30:02.885 --> 30:04.219
I'm sorry, man.

30:16.632 --> 30:20.101
She was, um, still breathing.

30:21.870 --> 30:23.304
She say anything?

30:25.174 --> 30:27.041
Finnegan,

30:27.042 --> 30:29.311
did she say who shot her?

30:34.650 --> 30:36.784
Find Anna
whatever-the-fuck-her-name-is,

30:36.785 --> 30:38.253
and Kelly.

30:38.654 --> 30:39.988
You bring them in.

30:40.522 --> 30:42.390
And you go in heavy.

30:42.791 --> 30:44.392
Yes, sir.

30:45.493 --> 30:47.593
Yes, sir.

31:11.486 --> 31:13.221
She's dead?

31:13.755 --> 31:15.223
Yes.

31:15.357 --> 31:17.225
You killed her?

31:18.827 --> 31:20.695
I knew I liked you.

31:20.696 --> 31:22.964
I couldn't put my finger on it,

31:22.965 --> 31:24.833
I knew there was a reason.

31:26.568 --> 31:28.169
Jesus Christ, Marty.

31:28.170 --> 31:29.904
What? Bad taste?

31:29.905 --> 31:31.639
- She was a Federal Agent.
- Yeah.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.175
A Federal Agent who was
hell bent on ruining my life.

31:34.176 --> 31:36.177
She wasn't too keen on you, by the way.

31:36.178 --> 31:38.179
We're kind of in a
time crunch here, Marty.

31:39.915 --> 31:41.383
Okay, how much time do we have?

31:42.050 --> 31:44.051
Maybe less than 24 hours.

31:44.052 --> 31:46.454
There's gonna be an APB
out on her, nationwide.

31:46.455 --> 31:47.922
No shit. Me, too.

31:47.923 --> 31:48.990
So what do you want me to do?

31:48.991 --> 31:50.591
You need me to help you get out of town?

31:50.592 --> 31:51.659
No. No.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.862
I'm guessing, you didn't come here
to have me negotiate a surrender?

31:54.863 --> 31:57.398
We have a 24-hour window
with this flash drive.

31:57.399 --> 32:00.068
We need a score and then we disappear.

32:00.736 --> 32:03.405
And how are we planning on doing that?

32:05.407 --> 32:07.541
That I don't know yet.

32:07.542 --> 32:10.077
I'm sure boxing
is out of the question.

32:10.078 --> 32:11.946
No. We need something
bigger, much bigger.

32:25.294 --> 32:26.894
You know what I would love?

32:26.895 --> 32:29.163
Hack into Bershov's accounts

32:29.164 --> 32:31.299
and take that fucker down.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.368
I can try,

32:34.369 --> 32:35.970
but I don't think I
can do it in 24 hours.

32:37.439 --> 32:39.707
Besides, even if we
could hack into his funds

32:39.708 --> 32:42.243
anything that we got they
would probably freeze it.

32:42.244 --> 32:44.245
What we need is cash, and lots of it.

32:44.246 --> 32:45.847
Give it a try.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.193
"An evening of music

32:59.194 --> 33:01.595
"hosted by Max Bershov."
What is this, Marty?

33:01.596 --> 33:04.799
Closing the mine deal tonight. Why?

33:06.401 --> 33:09.203
You want Bershov off your back?

33:09.204 --> 33:12.140
Yeah, I want Bershov
off my fucking back.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.945
I might have an idea that could
solve both of our problems.

33:21.216 --> 33:22.683
- Federal Agents! Open up!
- Shit.

33:22.684 --> 33:24.419
Stay here.

33:30.292 --> 33:32.159
Marty Stein, we've got a
warrant to search your home.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.096
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Let
me see that, please?

33:38.700 --> 33:40.701
- This is for my residence.
- That's right.

33:40.702 --> 33:42.036
Well, I'm sorry to inform you,

33:42.037 --> 33:43.771
but this is also my place of business,

33:43.772 --> 33:46.173
and as such is not
covered by this document.

33:46.174 --> 33:47.508
Marty, get the fuck out of my way.

33:47.509 --> 33:49.110
If you take one more
step onto my property,

33:49.111 --> 33:51.246
I'll have you detained
for breaking and entering.

33:51.247 --> 33:53.381
Anything you find in
here will be thrown out

33:53.382 --> 33:54.715
before it even gets to court.

33:54.716 --> 33:56.984
I will sue you, I will have your badge!

33:56.985 --> 33:59.254
And I will sue your department!

34:01.523 --> 34:03.925
Fuck it! Search this prick's house!

34:40.762 --> 34:42.230
Yeah?

34:42.496 --> 34:44.098
What's up, Karl?

34:47.168 --> 34:49.304
All right. I'll be there.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.842
Do you have the drive?

36:08.183 --> 36:11.119
I found a buyer for
75 cents on the dollar.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.921
I was hoping for more.

36:13.922 --> 36:17.926
Jesus. "Thank you, Marty, for
finding a buyer on such short notice."

36:19.261 --> 36:20.728
- Did you call the SEC?
- I did.

36:20.729 --> 36:23.531
- And?
- They were very interested in what I had to say.

36:23.532 --> 36:24.865
Yeah, I'll bet.

36:24.866 --> 36:26.867
They're primed and waiting
for our phone call, Marty.

36:26.868 --> 36:29.136
All you have to do is represent Bershov

36:29.137 --> 36:32.606
to the best of your
abilities, and lose, of course.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.608
- And he goes away.
- Think I can manage that.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.944
Yeah? Good.

36:36.478 --> 36:37.945
First things first,

36:37.946 --> 36:40.347
I need you to locate the
original auditor's report, okay?

36:40.348 --> 36:42.483
And then, give me the
schematics to the hotel.

36:55.564 --> 36:56.898
There's the up.

37:00.368 --> 37:03.170
Wait till they clear out, then we go.

37:03.171 --> 37:04.638
Slim and I take the front.

37:04.639 --> 37:05.974
Wook and D round the back.

37:08.510 --> 37:10.111
All right.

37:11.446 --> 37:14.648
According to this, Bershov
will have his private security detail

37:14.649 --> 37:15.983
posted at every entrance.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.118
A team of two will be following

37:18.119 --> 37:20.387
eight feet behind his wife at all times.

37:20.388 --> 37:22.122
There'll be a dozen
floaters in the crowd,

37:22.123 --> 37:24.525
who may or may not be plain-clothed.

37:24.526 --> 37:26.794
There's security cameras
all throughout the hotel.

37:26.795 --> 37:29.063
But they are not hooked up to CPD.

37:29.064 --> 37:31.732
And sometimes, hiding in plain
sight's the best place to hide.

37:31.733 --> 37:33.334
And sometimes it isn't, Ethan.

37:33.335 --> 37:36.137
Mia, if you have any other
suggestions, I am all ears.

37:41.876 --> 37:43.211
There she is.

37:47.215 --> 37:48.549
Wow!

37:48.550 --> 37:50.684
Three million smacks.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.820
I'd be cautious,
too, if I were Bershov.

38:00.962 --> 38:02.697
Let's go.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.268
- Is that Bershov's guest list?
- Uh-huh.

38:41.269 --> 38:43.671
Okay. Find someone who's RSVP-ed "no"

38:43.672 --> 38:46.073
and make it a "yes" for him.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.876
Look at the bright side,

38:48.877 --> 38:51.145
worst case scenario, you get caught,

38:51.146 --> 38:53.814
you'll look fabulous for your mug shot.

38:53.815 --> 38:55.949
That's comforting, Marty.

38:55.950 --> 38:58.085
- So are we all set?
- Yeah.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.754
Okay, kids, I will see you

39:00.755 --> 39:03.558
later tonight. Have fun. Don't be late.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.028
All right.

39:11.477 --> 39:12.900
It's done.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.000
Good.

39:31.453 --> 39:32.920
What?

39:45.066 --> 39:46.400
Still nothing?

39:46.401 --> 39:47.468
We've got everyone out there looking.

39:47.469 --> 39:48.936
- We'll find them.
- You think so?

39:48.937 --> 39:50.671
I know so.

39:50.672 --> 39:52.940
Remember those two felons that
got out of that max security prison

39:52.941 --> 39:54.808
- in Chester back in March?
- Uh-huh.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.077
They had 1,000 Federal
Marshals out there

39:57.078 --> 39:58.812
looking for them, it
took 'em five weeks!

39:58.813 --> 40:00.547
And the only reason why they found
'em is 'cause one of the pricks

40:00.548 --> 40:02.950
bragged to an old flame
about how he got out.

40:02.951 --> 40:05.286
Okay, but they still
found them in the end.

40:05.287 --> 40:08.822
Shot them dead, as I recall.

40:13.361 --> 40:14.829
Finnegan.

40:18.032 --> 40:19.367
Yeah.

40:21.236 --> 40:22.703
Yeah.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.010
I came alone.

41:04.345 --> 41:05.813
You wanna talk?

41:07.273 --> 41:08.874
Talk.

42:29.497 --> 42:30.964
Those are beautiful.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.032
Thank you.

42:32.033 --> 42:33.501
Um...

42:34.302 --> 42:35.770
May I?

43:19.547 --> 43:21.014
Stein.

43:22.216 --> 43:24.085
Martin Stein. You got it?

43:27.288 --> 43:28.355
Name please?

43:28.356 --> 43:30.491
Uh, Laura and Douglas Flute.

43:31.826 --> 43:33.561
- Enjoy your evening.
- Thank you.

43:34.495 --> 43:36.230
Ah. Miss? Excuse me.

43:37.966 --> 43:39.433
Here you go, darling.

43:40.501 --> 43:41.969
Thanks.

43:43.171 --> 43:45.840
Let's hope the evening
goes that smoothly.

43:49.844 --> 43:51.178
Max.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.847
Congratulations.

43:53.848 --> 43:55.716
Did you spot Bershov yet?

43:55.717 --> 43:57.451
He's standing there talking to Marty.

43:57.986 --> 43:59.319
You got me a hell of a deal.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.455
- Hell of a goddamn deal.
- Hey, hey, hey. Quiet.

44:01.456 --> 44:03.056
Not so loud.

44:03.057 --> 44:06.260
Emmerson's around here somewhere,
the deal doesn't close until tomorrow.

44:06.661 --> 44:08.396
I want you to meet my wife.

44:09.330 --> 44:10.530
Oksana!

44:12.934 --> 44:17.337
Marty, this is the
love of my life, Oksana.

44:17.338 --> 44:20.807
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

44:20.808 --> 44:24.811
And may I say, you look
absolutely stunning.

44:24.812 --> 44:26.414
Oh, thank you.

44:33.221 --> 44:36.423
Oh, my God, that thing could
have its own gravitational pull.

44:36.424 --> 44:37.891
Mmm.

44:37.892 --> 44:39.359
You have the document?

44:39.360 --> 44:40.828
Mmm-hmm.

44:42.030 --> 44:44.297
Where is Emmerson?

44:44.298 --> 44:46.166
Standing at the bar.

44:46.167 --> 44:48.436
Well, good luck.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.571
You, too.

44:53.641 --> 44:55.109
Excuse me.

44:57.378 --> 44:59.112
Some party, huh?

44:59.113 --> 45:00.847
- That is for certain.
- Yeah.

45:00.848 --> 45:03.784
I'll have a Maker's.
Neat, please. Thanks.

45:03.785 --> 45:06.587
I can't believe I missed
the stampede for this...

45:06.988 --> 45:08.455
What's your event?

45:08.456 --> 45:11.124
You know, I'm partial to
chuck-wagon racing actually.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.592
Don't hear that every day.

45:12.593 --> 45:14.788
Ah, the bulls and broncs,
they get all the attention.

45:14.823 --> 45:17.664
But, uh, I grew up in Oregon, so
I guess I just love the wagons.

45:17.665 --> 45:20.467
- Where in Oregon?
- Uh, right outside Eugene, actually.

45:20.662 --> 45:22.203
- Know it well.
- Really?

45:22.238 --> 45:23.737
Yeah. Grew up 20 miles
from there. North Bend.

45:23.772 --> 45:24.935
- No shit.
- Yeah.

45:24.970 --> 45:26.623
- Well, cheers.
- Yeah.

45:26.658 --> 45:28.075
So how long are you in town for?

45:28.076 --> 45:30.210
A quick trip. Got in this afternoon,

45:30.211 --> 45:31.945
business tomorrow, party tonight.

45:31.946 --> 45:34.881
- And then right back to Moscow?
- Vaduz, actually.

45:34.882 --> 45:37.284
My nephew's striking for their FC.

45:37.285 --> 45:39.286
Swiss football?

45:39.287 --> 45:42.251
Really, Max, if you wanna watch
athletes embarrass themselves,

45:42.286 --> 45:44.810
stick around one more day,
I'll talk a Bearse you to game.

45:45.827 --> 45:47.161
Ah.

45:53.668 --> 45:55.135
Excuse me.

45:55.803 --> 45:57.537
Are you Oksana Anosov?

45:57.538 --> 45:59.005
Anosov.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.007
I haven't been called
that in many years.

46:01.008 --> 46:04.477
Oh, right. I'm sorry, um, it's just...

46:04.478 --> 46:07.281
- I'm a huge fan of your work.
- Oh?

46:13.154 --> 46:15.422
Ladies and
gentlemen, honored guests,

46:15.423 --> 46:19.292
it is my great pleasure to introduce
our evening's entertainment,

46:19.293 --> 46:21.962
Gwen Mullova and Franz Koert.

46:26.367 --> 46:29.436
The opera house you
designed in Stavropol,

46:29.437 --> 46:31.705
it's reminiscent of an early Melnikov.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.974
Well, that's very kind of you to say.

46:35.576 --> 46:39.713
And tonight, our gracious
hosts Mr. And Mrs. Max Bershov

46:39.714 --> 46:42.115
have provided us with a special treat.

46:42.116 --> 46:44.251
From their private collection,

46:44.252 --> 46:46.119
The Messiah Stradivarius.

46:56.664 --> 46:59.599
Never miss an opportunity
to show off, huh, Max?

46:59.600 --> 47:01.334
Come on, Marty, don't you want to know

47:01.335 --> 47:03.603
what a $30 million violin sounds like?

47:03.604 --> 47:05.071
Yeah, a piece of wood
is a piece of wood.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.406
You think?

47:06.407 --> 47:08.142
I'm more of a horn guy.

47:12.013 --> 47:14.281
We would like to thank the
Bershovs for this opportunity

47:14.282 --> 47:16.283
to hear such a unique instrument.

47:16.284 --> 47:21.488
At the host's request,
Tchaikovsky's Serenade Melancolique.

47:53.921 --> 47:56.056
Max, your goons are extorting me.

47:56.057 --> 47:58.726
No more business tonight, Marty.

48:03.430 --> 48:05.298
You figure he knows any Merle Haggard?

48:05.299 --> 48:06.899
Shit.

48:06.900 --> 48:08.368
It doesn't hurt to ask, Earl.

48:08.369 --> 48:10.103
Doesn't hurt to ask.

48:10.904 --> 48:13.439
Do we, uh... Do we know each other?

48:13.440 --> 48:15.975
You know what, I don't
think we've ever met before.

48:15.976 --> 48:18.645
But you can think of me
as your guardian angel.

48:18.646 --> 48:20.647
Why would I do that?

48:21.982 --> 48:25.585
Because I'm about to save you
a billion dollars. Take a look.

48:30.924 --> 48:33.459
What exactly am I looking at here?

48:33.460 --> 48:35.194
You're looking at a mining report

48:35.195 --> 48:37.063
that was conducted three months ago

48:37.064 --> 48:40.667
by an independent auditor
LM Dorr on the uranium mine

48:40.668 --> 48:43.469
that you're about to
purchase from Mr. Bershov.

48:43.470 --> 48:45.071
Where'd you find this?

48:45.072 --> 48:46.673
Does it really matter, Earl?

48:48.809 --> 48:51.210
You think you can cheat me,
you commie piece of shit?

48:51.211 --> 48:53.346
Been hitting the bar a bit
hard tonight, Earl, huh?

48:53.347 --> 48:55.749
You tried burying this,
you son of a bitch.

48:58.952 --> 49:00.820
I don't know what you think
this is, but I assure you...

49:00.821 --> 49:02.555
There's no uranium in that fucking mine

49:02.556 --> 49:04.824
- is what this is.
- Hey, hey. Wild and libelous accusations...

49:04.825 --> 49:06.559
Stay the hell out of this, Stein.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.161
Stay out of it!

49:08.162 --> 49:09.896
You think you can pull this
kind of shit over here, Bershov?

49:09.897 --> 49:12.566
Eh? You're not in the
Urals anymore, comrade.

49:12.567 --> 49:14.434
You wait till the SEC
hears about this, buddy boy.

49:14.435 --> 49:15.768
You're done in the U.S.

49:15.769 --> 49:16.836
- You got me? Done!
- Okay, okay.

49:16.837 --> 49:18.838
- That's enough.
- Get your hands off me!

49:22.443 --> 49:24.711
- Step back, sir. Just step back.
- Okay.

49:29.650 --> 49:31.518
- A little help here. Are you all right?
- I'm so sorry.

49:32.986 --> 49:34.988
I'm so, so sorry.

49:36.990 --> 49:38.858
Sorry, excuse me.

49:38.859 --> 49:41.260
She took the necklace.

49:41.261 --> 49:42.995
- We have a security breach.
- She took the necklace.

49:42.996 --> 49:44.731
Main room floor. South west side.

49:47.534 --> 49:48.601
Wait, wait, wait.

49:48.602 --> 49:49.803
Sir?

49:51.672 --> 49:53.272
No! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:53.273 --> 49:54.741
- Not her, not her!
- Take your hands off of me.

49:54.742 --> 49:56.209
We need to protect the violin, sir.

49:56.210 --> 49:57.410
Of course.

49:57.411 --> 49:59.279
- Let go of me!
- Not her!

49:59.413 --> 50:01.010
Her.

50:01.014 --> 50:02.616
Thank you.

50:04.618 --> 50:06.086
Your bag, ma'am.

50:09.957 --> 50:11.691
You have to come with us.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.761
I have no idea how that got in there.

50:15.829 --> 50:18.364
This is ridiculous.

50:18.365 --> 50:20.633
I'm sorry for any
inconvenience. It's our mistake.

50:20.634 --> 50:23.569
Yeah, but this isn't the last
you'll be hearing from me,

50:23.570 --> 50:25.305
I can assure you of that.

51:26.567 --> 51:27.633
Don't you fucking move.

51:27.634 --> 51:29.902
Down on your knees, put
your hands on your head.

51:29.903 --> 51:31.238
Do it now!

51:38.712 --> 51:40.580
Stop or I'll shoot.

52:05.138 --> 52:06.606
You set me up.

52:07.941 --> 52:09.409
You'll live.

52:12.212 --> 52:15.682
- We good?
- Far from fucking good, Ethan.

52:15.816 --> 52:17.416
Yeah, well...

52:17.417 --> 52:19.819
I just gave you your
career back, Detective.

52:27.694 --> 52:30.630
Detective Finnegan requesting
backup, Tambor House,

52:30.631 --> 52:32.899
North East corner.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.035
I got Anna Drubeskaya in custody.

52:56.523 --> 52:58.958
Put your fucking hands on your head.

53:05.665 --> 53:10.238
_

53:11.204 --> 53:12.806
All rise.

53:12.807 --> 53:14.941
Docket number
six-three-two-two-four.

53:14.942 --> 53:17.743
The Honorable Judge
Martin Stein presiding.

53:19.212 --> 53:20.814
You may be seated.

53:21.081 --> 53:22.549
Thank you.

53:25.619 --> 53:28.955
Well, well, well, well, well.

53:28.956 --> 53:32.425
I'd like to say that I'm surprised
to see you in my courtroom,

53:32.426 --> 53:38.431
but sadly, I feel that
this was somehow inevitable.

53:43.103 --> 53:45.238
How does the defendant plead?

53:46.305 --> 53:52.793
