00:02.250 --> 00:05.250
Great meal, Annie.
I know I said that last night

00:05.292 --> 00:07.458
- but tonight, I really mean it.
- That's what you said last night.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.667
- I've gotta stop talking so much.
- Last time I ate this well,

00:09.708 --> 00:13.250
I was dating that sous chef
at cookshop. Michelle.

00:13.292 --> 00:16.125
No, wait. Chelsea. Yeah.

00:16.167 --> 00:18.875
No, she lived in Chelsea!

00:18.917 --> 00:22.167
- Sounds like that was built to last.
- Oh, she's still in the rotation.

00:22.208 --> 00:25.375
That's what every girl wants, to
be a nameless cog in your sex machine.

00:25.417 --> 00:27.125
Oh, well, when you say it like that,

00:27.167 --> 00:30.292
it's more like, "will you
be a cog in my sex machine?"

00:30.333 --> 00:34.333
- Sign me up.
- The dishwasher's throwing up.

00:34.375 --> 00:37.792
- Leigh, you used the wrong soap!
- Is there more than one?

00:37.827 --> 00:40.875
<i>Oh, God. It's everywhere!</i>

00:40.910 --> 00:43.833
If that was Parkinson's, we're cool.
If not, what the hell, Dad?

00:43.875 --> 00:45.375
You've been texting the whole meal.

00:45.417 --> 00:47.333
It's Reese, it seems
like all we do is argue now

00:47.375 --> 00:50.208
about what movie to see, how
to use hashtags on Twitter.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.958
You know, who hangs up
first used to be a game.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.500
- Now, it's a serious discussion.
- Ian, when it comes to women,

00:55.542 --> 00:59.375
there's six words you gotta remember:
"You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry."

00:59.417 --> 01:01.542
Ah. That's one way to go.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.042
But why would you say you're sorry
if you're not sorry?

01:04.083 --> 01:06.917
It's just easier. Sometimes,
you win the fight by losing it.

01:06.958 --> 01:08.375
So it's okay to lie?

01:08.417 --> 01:09.833
<i>Sounds like someone
wants to be a news reporter.</i>

01:09.875 --> 01:12.446
Why don't you go in my room
and get my tape recorder?

01:14.833 --> 01:16.875
And that's how you dodge a question.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.042
Hey, sweetie. Where you been?

01:18.083 --> 01:19.667
<i>I thought your photography
class was over at six.</i>

01:19.702 --> 01:23.542
It was, but I walked home,
and I couldn't stop taking pictures.

01:23.577 --> 01:27.917
I saw this plastic bag
just dancing on the breeze.

01:27.958 --> 01:30.333
So I moved it out of the way
and took a picture of the building,

01:30.375 --> 01:32.542
which reminds me: Do you want
to go to MoMA this weekend?

01:32.583 --> 01:34.542
You wanna go to a museum with me?

01:34.583 --> 01:35.875
Just the two of us?
At the same time?

01:35.917 --> 01:38.458
Well, yeah, I'm not gonna make
you stand in another room and

01:38.459 --> 01:41.000
pretend you don't know me.
This isn't my 14th birthday party.

01:41.042 --> 01:43.000
Eve's been a whole new
person since she started

01:43.042 --> 01:45.167
taking photography at
the community center.

01:45.208 --> 01:49.458
- She smiles. She laughs.
- At first, we thought it was drugs.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.458
But it... it turns out she can feel.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.375
I still have to choose
photos for my class project,

01:53.417 --> 01:55.667
but I'm having the hardest
time narrowing it down.

01:55.708 --> 01:57.417
Maybe we can help.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.417
I'm not really sure this
is gonna be your thing.

01:59.458 --> 02:04.250
Eve, it's art.
We're arty. No judgment.

02:04.285 --> 02:06.583
<i>- Come on.
- Come on. Great.</i>

02:06.625 --> 02:08.667
I'm really looking forward
to seeing your nudes.

02:08.708 --> 02:10.958
<i>- Oh, my.
- Interesting.</i>

02:11.000 --> 02:12.125
<i>- Wow.
- Ooh.</i>

02:12.167 --> 02:15.092
- Holy cow.
- Male nudes.

02:15.133 --> 02:18.300
Totally naked, nude men...
naked, nude men.

02:18.342 --> 02:20.950
- Oh, well, he's wearing a hat.
- Yeah, there's a healthy fella.

02:20.992 --> 02:22.658
- Wha... what's his name?
- I don't know.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.283
They're just models
that came into our class.

02:24.325 --> 02:25.825
It's nice of them
to provide naked men

02:25.867 --> 02:27.158
to come and expose themselves to you.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.783
I knew you were gonna
be worried about this.

02:28.825 --> 02:30.867
We're not weird. Wha...
I mean, come on, Eve.

02:30.908 --> 02:34.783
Look who you're talking to.
We are progressive people.

02:34.825 --> 02:39.575
- We're full-frontal progressive.
- We were just taken a back by... by...

02:39.617 --> 02:43.033
- by your talent.
- There's a lot of talent here!

02:43.068 --> 02:44.950
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

02:44.985 --> 02:47.492
Oh, great.
Thanks for being so cool, guys.

02:47.527 --> 02:49.856
You know, I'm impressed.

02:51.699 --> 02:52.699
<i>Ohh...</i>

02:52.700 --> 02:55.958
That guy's not normal, right?
She's using a special lens for that?

02:58.450 --> 03:01.158
<i><b>1x03 - "Art"</b></i>

<i><font color="yellow"> sync & correction by f1nc0

03:09.100 --> 03:11.308
Okay, should I just chuck
the rest of this bratwurst?

03:11.343 --> 03:14.683
- Definitely.
- All right, we need to talk about this.

03:14.725 --> 03:16.058
We can't have our daughter hanging out

03:16.100 --> 03:19.058
in a room full of nude men,
at least not until college.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.683
Or... and this is
just a thought... never!

03:21.725 --> 03:24.725
But she's been such a delight
since she started taking that class.

03:24.767 --> 03:28.225
You know, the other day,
she complimented me on my briefcase.

03:28.267 --> 03:31.058
- I went into the bathroom and cried.
- It's like after all these years,

03:31.100 --> 03:33.975
she's finally treating us
like we're the cool parents.

03:34.017 --> 03:35.683
All right, we have to
shut this down delicately,

03:35.725 --> 03:39.850
- or she'll go right back to being 'old Eve'.
- 'Old Eve' is the worst.

03:39.892 --> 03:41.600
I'll tell you what. I'll talk to her.

03:41.642 --> 03:43.475
She wants to be an artist?
I'll treat her like an artist.

03:43.517 --> 03:46.100
- Besides, you know how you get.
- What do you mean, Mike?

03:46.142 --> 03:47.933
What, you think I can't
sit her down calmly

03:47.968 --> 03:52.058
and look her in the... You know what?
Okay, I am hearing that now.

03:52.093 --> 03:54.600
Harris, wait!
There's something I wanna ask you.

03:54.642 --> 03:57.933
- It's kinda personal.
- Look, man. None of those ads work.

03:57.975 --> 04:00.433
- You've got what you got.
- No, it's... Seriously?

04:00.475 --> 04:01.933
So "guaranteed results" means nothing?

04:01.975 --> 04:05.225
- Mm-mm.
- But no. I saw you disagree with my Dad.

04:05.267 --> 04:06.475
What do you think I
should do about Reese?

04:06.517 --> 04:07.975
I don't wanna get involved, man.

04:08.017 --> 04:10.850
But, you know, dating shouldn't be
that hard. It's like buying a car.

04:10.892 --> 04:12.433
Choose something dependable
and keep it forever.

04:12.475 --> 04:14.517
- So I should propose.
- No!

04:14.558 --> 04:18.308
Uh-uh. Test drive as many
as you can. You're young.

04:18.350 --> 04:21.058
Why fix a beater when there
are other cars on the lot?

04:21.100 --> 04:24.642
Look, say you need space.
Then walk away.

04:24.683 --> 04:27.100
It looks like this.

04:27.142 --> 04:30.566
<i>Bye.</i>

04:36.550 --> 04:40.342
Luke, I am your father.

04:40.383 --> 04:42.675
- Graham, what the hell?
- It's not my fault.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.342
If this is broken, you're dead.

04:44.383 --> 04:46.217
You know you're not supposed
to play in the hallway.

04:46.258 --> 04:50.008
- You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry.
- Well...

04:50.050 --> 04:54.758
I guess it was just an accident.
Can the Empire Strike Back in your room?

04:56.967 --> 05:01.217
Dad was right.
It's like I learned a Jedi mind trick.

05:01.258 --> 05:04.056
Now, you're gonna delete this.

05:05.742 --> 05:09.200
Looking at pictures, huh?
You know what I like about art?

05:09.235 --> 05:11.658
The way it leaves certain
things to the imagination.

05:11.693 --> 05:15.325
Exactly. It's all about subtext.

05:15.360 --> 05:20.492
Some people look at this,
and all they see is a naked man.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.367
- Idiots.
- But what they're really seeing

05:23.408 --> 05:26.825
is a subversion of the artistic
paradigm that objectifies women.

05:26.867 --> 05:29.908
Well, hat's off to you,
except on that guy.

05:29.950 --> 05:32.283
Although, you know, sometimes...
and hear me out on this...

05:32.325 --> 05:34.825
wouldn't it be more subversive
to do something less edgy?

05:34.867 --> 05:37.089
- In what way?
- Well, when I was a kid, I played

05:37.185 --> 05:39.970
lead guitar in a garage band,
and all we played was heavy metal.

05:40.033 --> 05:42.700
You used to play guitar?
Why did you quit?

05:42.742 --> 05:44.825
My parents made me.
They wanted me to play piccolo.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.179
- But the point is...
- Piccolo? Ugh, piccolo sucks.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.450
- Guitar is way cooler.
- That's what I said.

05:49.492 --> 05:51.575
I mean, piccolo is
basically like a tiny flute.

05:51.610 --> 05:54.873
- I wanted to play real-sized things.
- Of course you did, and you should've.

05:55.175 --> 05:58.725
That's why it's...
it's so great that you get it.

05:59.419 --> 06:03.312
- What do I get?
- My art. Me.

06:04.718 --> 06:07.621
You know what?
I'm gonna dedicate my project to you.

06:07.790 --> 06:11.077
I'll call it "Dad's piccolo."

06:12.745 --> 06:14.673
Oh, don't call it that!

06:20.983 --> 06:23.983
I just graded 74 papers on
"The Scarlet Letter",

06:24.018 --> 06:26.900
and all but two of them
refer to a scene,

06:26.942 --> 06:30.900
- that is only in the movie.
- So let me guess. 2 "A"s and 72 "B"s.

06:30.942 --> 06:34.733
Well, I gave a "C" to the girl
who called the main character "Demi."

06:34.775 --> 06:37.983
- How'd your talk with Eve go?
- Well, it was, uh... it, um...

06:38.025 --> 06:39.860
Uh... wha...

06:40.233 --> 06:42.942
- What did you do?
- I did nothing. I literally did nothing.

06:42.983 --> 06:46.150
I-I-one minute, I'm talking
to her about being less edgy.

06:46.192 --> 06:47.817
And the next minute, she's
dedicating the project to me.

06:47.858 --> 06:50.483
I knew I should've done this!

06:50.518 --> 06:54.567
- You love them too much.
- I do. It's a real problem.

06:54.602 --> 06:55.817
You know, my parents would've just said,

06:55.858 --> 06:57.400
"You have to stop because we said so."

06:57.442 --> 06:59.317
I hated it when my parents used
"Because I said so."

06:59.358 --> 07:01.942
That is exactly what I'm gonna say
when I put them in a home.

07:01.983 --> 07:03.525
Well, that's clearly not an option.

07:03.567 --> 07:07.108
Okay, I got it.
She is going to stop on her own

07:07.150 --> 07:08.983
because I am going
to scare her straight.

07:09.025 --> 07:12.983
She needs to hear the
story of Carley Steiner.

07:13.025 --> 07:16.067
- Who's Carley Steiner?
- She's a girl I went to high school with,

07:16.108 --> 07:18.442
and she cut off all of her
hair in a performance piece.

07:18.483 --> 07:21.025
And then when it grew back,
it was all stumpy and weird.

07:21.067 --> 07:24.192
I'm gonna jazz it up a little
and throw some heroin in there.

07:24.233 --> 07:27.450
Oh, that'll work. That will work.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.667
Thanks for joining
me on such short notice.

07:30.702 --> 07:35.250
Um, are you hungry?
I could scare up some soup.

07:35.285 --> 07:39.875
I had to be a man and just tell Reese
in simple terms that it was over.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.878
A relationship is like a car.

07:45.875 --> 07:49.833
And even with regular maintenance
and routine oil changes,

07:49.875 --> 07:53.583
a tire can still fly off,
and you crash into a tree.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.500
- Okay.
- I guess what I'm trying to say is

07:56.542 --> 08:01.000
that you don't want to
drive the same car forever.

08:01.042 --> 08:03.208
Unless it's a foreign
model, which you're not.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.208
You're from Dallas.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.000
And no one's saying you
don't have a good grill...

08:07.042 --> 08:08.625
Are you breaking up with me?

08:08.667 --> 08:12.792
I'm sorry. I-I just...
I need my own space.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.417
Now technically, I would
get up and walk away,

08:15.452 --> 08:19.528
but you're in my room, so...

08:19.833 --> 08:22.458
And to think I lent
you my skinny jeans.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.458
Hashtag: What a jerk.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.817
Hashtags are for
topics, not opinions.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.825
Now that I knew the six magic words,
I could do anything.

08:38.866 --> 08:42.908
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

08:42.950 --> 08:46.075

08:59.558 --> 09:02.058
Okay, third time's a charm.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.392
Graham.
Have you lost your mind?

09:05.433 --> 09:08.183
Your parents are gonna
give me this rug one day.

09:08.225 --> 09:12.225
- This isn't double dare.
- You're right. I'm wrong.

09:12.267 --> 09:16.350
- I'm sorry.
- God, you're such a cutie.

09:17.725 --> 09:21.142
All right, one more time,
and then you have to clean it up.

09:21.183 --> 09:23.850
I'm gonna pour.

09:23.892 --> 09:26.475
- Hey, Reese.
- Oh, hey, Aunt Leigh,

09:26.517 --> 09:30.433
- except you're not my Aunt anymore.
- Never was. Is everything all right?

09:30.475 --> 09:35.308
- Ian just broke up with me.
- What? Why?

09:35.343 --> 09:40.100
- Are we gonna do this or what?
- I-I don't know.

09:40.142 --> 09:41.558
It was like I was
talking to someone else.

09:41.600 --> 09:45.558
- He compared me to a used car!
- Honey, that's awful.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.392
- Foreign or domestic?
- Domestic.

09:47.433 --> 09:49.600
Honey, that's awful.

09:49.642 --> 09:52.225
I can't believe my own
nephew would be so heartless.

09:52.267 --> 09:54.725
- You know what you have to do.
- Learn from this and grow stronger?

09:54.767 --> 09:58.100
No.
You have to teach him a lesson.

09:58.142 --> 10:00.892
Ian has to learn that he
can't treat women like this.

10:00.933 --> 10:06.225
- Who is his hottest friend?
- Albino Tim.

10:06.267 --> 10:08.956
Oh, jeez. This is gonna be hard.

10:09.392 --> 10:13.808
So there was this entire patch
in the back that was just gone,

10:13.850 --> 10:18.183
and that is where Carlene
would inject the heroin.

10:18.218 --> 10:21.850
It was awful.
I mean, one day, she was this sweet girl

10:21.892 --> 10:25.642
with a bright future. And then, she was...
What are you doing?

10:25.683 --> 10:28.642
Oh, sorry. This story
is just making you come alive.

10:28.683 --> 10:33.767
- I've gotta capture it. Keep going.
- Uh, okay, so things got really bad

10:33.808 --> 10:37.558
in the 90s because heroin
was coming back in style

10:37.600 --> 10:41.267
- just as hats were going out...
- Lean back a little.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.419
The light is going crazy
on your face right now.

10:44.933 --> 10:47.975
- Good crazy?
- And put your arm up like this.

10:48.017 --> 10:50.527
Eve, I'm not gonna put my...
Up like that?

10:50.581 --> 10:51.906
Yeah.

10:52.575 --> 10:55.664
Oh, I love it.
Mom, you look great.

10:56.037 --> 10:58.710
Don't mind me.
Just pretend I'm not here.

10:58.782 --> 11:02.090
You're beautiful. You're a natural.
Now, lose the top.

11:02.302 --> 11:04.267
<i>And you're meeting with
the parking authority later,</i>

11:04.308 --> 11:06.683
so you probably wanna move
your Tesla from the lobby.

11:06.725 --> 11:10.850
Kay, it's the perfect crime.
I don't have to pay for parking,

11:10.892 --> 11:13.808
and it's a car that
people think they can win.

11:13.850 --> 11:16.100
Harris. Harris. Oh.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.142
I need your advice about Reese.

11:17.183 --> 11:19.683
Oh, you gotta be kidding me, man.
This is my place of business.

11:19.725 --> 11:22.017
I did what you told me to do,
and I broke up with her.

11:22.058 --> 11:23.725
And now, I can't stop
thinking about her.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.725
- I can't eat. I can't sleep.
- It's been one day.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.058
Well, I know a thing or two
about unrequited love.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.892
You see, there's this correspondent
here who's like a mentor to me...

11:31.933 --> 11:33.433
- Kay.
- He just inspires me so much.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.017
- He's overcome so many obstacles.
- Are you talking about my Dad?

11:36.058 --> 11:38.850
Kay, let me introduce
you to Mike Henry's son.

11:38.885 --> 11:43.017
Mike Henry?
Sorry, that does not ring a bell.

11:43.058 --> 11:46.017
What's that, Gail?
Oh, it's in the cabinet.

11:46.058 --> 11:48.017
- All right. Make it quick.
- She sent me this text message.

11:48.058 --> 11:50.350
"Thanks for the picnic, Tim."

11:50.392 --> 11:53.475
"Sorry we laid out in the sun so long."

11:53.517 --> 11:56.225
This is the third girl
Albino Tim has snaked from me.

11:56.267 --> 11:58.433
You know, damn him and
his mysterious red eyes.

11:58.475 --> 12:00.225
- I just wanna...
- Oh, come on.

12:00.267 --> 12:01.850
You seriously fell for this?

12:01.892 --> 12:03.975
Has Reese ever sent you
a accidental text before today?

12:04.017 --> 12:05.808
- No.
- All right, the fake text.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.850
It's a classic jilted woman move.
She wasn't with Tim.

12:09.892 --> 12:14.350
- So just stop worrying and get out there.
- Wow, you're so right. God.

12:14.392 --> 12:18.168
Oh, hey, do you know where I can buy
a raffle ticket for that car downstairs?

12:18.193 --> 12:21.700
- You can buy them from me.
- Harris was right.

12:21.735 --> 12:23.242
I had to put Reese in my rearview...

12:23.277 --> 12:27.325
God, dating really lends
itself to car metaphors.

12:27.367 --> 12:30.783
Anyway, it was time to set sail
to a new island alone.

12:58.158 --> 13:01.575
<i>♪ When I get out of bed ♪
♪ you know I miss you ♪</i>

13:01.610 --> 13:04.700
<i>♪ when I'm right in my car ♪
♪ you know I miss you ♪</i>

13:04.735 --> 13:07.283
<i>♪ in a traffic jam ♪
♪ you know I miss you ♪</i>

13:07.325 --> 13:09.033
How'd it go with Eve?

13:09.075 --> 13:11.325
Well, she's not taking
pictures of naked men anymore.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.617
I knew it. You
should've gone in first.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.283
You're the closer.
You're the closer.

13:14.325 --> 13:16.242
I don't know why they
don't send in closers first.

13:16.283 --> 13:17.575
Well, what can I say, Mike, you know?

13:17.617 --> 13:19.575
I just went in there.
I rolled up my sleeves.

13:19.617 --> 13:22.158
I took off my shirt, and...
Oh, my god, Mike.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.825
I messed up.
I messed up real bad.

13:24.867 --> 13:28.167
- You posed for her?
- She said I would be in shadow!

13:28.208 --> 13:30.542
But I don't know, man, it
seemed really light in there.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.442
Mom, I just hung up your photo.

13:32.483 --> 13:34.858
I went with the ones that
were a little more in focus

13:34.900 --> 13:36.650
because I think it's
important for people to see

13:36.692 --> 13:37.983
what women really look like.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.510
Wait, wait. People?
More than one people?

13:39.725 --> 13:42.558
Oh, yeah. This is my best work.
I've gotta put her in the show.

13:42.593 --> 13:44.267
- Uh, eh, show?
- Yeah.

13:44.302 --> 13:46.207
The art show at the
community center tomorrow.

13:46.274 --> 13:49.769
<i>Dad's piccolo is going to be huge.</i>

13:50.333 --> 13:52.193
New name, Eve!
New name!

13:53.426 --> 13:55.557
Ok, you know what?

13:55.558 --> 13:57.142
This is what we get for
being progressive parents.

13:57.183 --> 14:00.017
Ian is a drop-out, and
Eve is a pornographer now.

14:00.052 --> 14:02.058
- What the hell happened in there, Annie?
- I don't know.

14:02.093 --> 14:03.558
I just...
I get caught up in the moment.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.600
I understand how women
end up in Playboy.

14:05.642 --> 14:08.392
- I get it. It's a rush.
- All right, we tried being cool.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.933
We gotta just tell her flat-out
that picture's gotta come down.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.808
But Mike, it was like for an instant,

14:12.850 --> 14:15.225
I had a daughter and
not some judgmental,

14:15.267 --> 14:18.558
skinny enemy. I don't wanna
go back to garbage Eve.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.475
Garbage Eve, it sounds like the night
before some horrible holiday.

14:21.517 --> 14:25.683
Okay, we've exhausted every avenue.
There's only one option left to us.

14:25.725 --> 14:26.683
Art heist.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.642
- Art heist?
- Art heist.

14:28.683 --> 14:30.975
Okay, the only thing
crazier than that is...

14:31.017 --> 14:32.975
Getting naked in front
of your teenage daughter?

14:33.017 --> 14:35.254
Yeah, you're right.
Okay, let's do this.

14:36.725 --> 14:38.433
Where do you keep the
wrong soap for the dishwasher?

14:38.475 --> 14:41.225
- I don't know. By the sink, I think.
- Thanks.

14:46.683 --> 14:49.308
- Reese wants her skinny jeans back.
- I don't know where they are.

14:49.350 --> 14:52.267
- You're using them as a blanket.
- These are Mom's jeans.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.433
If that were true, it'd be
even creepier. Give me those.

14:58.308 --> 14:59.975
<i>Ian, I know you're hurting right now,</i>

15:00.017 --> 15:02.683
<i>but maybe this will teach
you to be nicer to girls.</i>

15:02.725 --> 15:08.142
- I should've never taken Harris' advice.
- What?! Harris' advice?

15:08.183 --> 15:10.748
You play your cards right,
I'll take you up to my rooftop.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.142
But you're gonna have
to hold onto me tight.

15:13.183 --> 15:14.433
I'm a little scared of heights.

15:16.017 --> 15:19.142
- There he is. You.
- Oh, Ian.

15:19.183 --> 15:22.600
- What are you doing to me, man?
- He dumped his girlfriend because of you.

15:22.642 --> 15:25.892
He compared her to a used car.
Do you know how hurtful that is?

15:25.927 --> 15:28.058
- Why'd you have to tell her that?
- I didn't.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.850
- Aunt Leigh, how'd you know about that?
- The poor girl was devastated.

15:30.892 --> 15:33.892
- When did you talk to Reese?
- Oh, I know.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.975
Right before she told her
to send you that fake text.

15:36.017 --> 15:38.892
I should've known.
Classic jilted woman move.

15:38.933 --> 15:40.642
Maybe women wouldn't feel so jilted

15:40.683 --> 15:42.308
if guys like you would
quit playing games.

15:42.350 --> 15:45.017
- Am I right?
- Don't listen to her, Chelsea.

15:45.058 --> 15:48.350
- I live in Chelsea!
- Oh.

15:48.392 --> 15:49.475
I... Oh.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.267
Thanks a lot. I pretended
to like quinoa for that woman.

15:52.308 --> 15:54.516
Harris, you think you're so smooth,
but women can see

15:54.517 --> 15:56.642
- right through your act.
- It's not an act.

15:56.683 --> 15:58.730
I have the utmost respect
for what's her name.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.642
Oh, it's Michelle.

16:00.683 --> 16:02.558
That's it.
I'll fix this right now.

16:02.593 --> 16:05.558
Damn, six Michelles on my phone.

16:05.593 --> 16:07.017
Would you say she was
an eight or a seven?

16:07.052 --> 16:09.517
- She was a ten.
- So seven, thanks.

16:09.558 --> 16:11.517
- Give me that phone.
- Hey.

16:11.558 --> 16:13.475
- Give me that...
- Don't touch it like that.

16:13.517 --> 16:15.017
You guys are less mature than I am.

16:15.058 --> 16:18.933
- And to think I let you be my mentor.
- Oh, you didn't let me do anything.

16:18.975 --> 16:20.892
- And you followed me to work.
- Contacts?

16:20.933 --> 16:23.683
God, no.
All Michelles are done.

16:23.725 --> 16:25.308
- Oh.
- Delete.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.850
Oh, you just... Oh.

16:30.892 --> 16:33.017
Hey, Brenda?

16:33.058 --> 16:35.642
I cannot believe we are doing this.

16:35.683 --> 16:38.600
Honey, it's just a community center.
It's not the Louvre.

16:38.642 --> 16:40.475
Where's your sense of adventure?

16:40.517 --> 16:43.433
Apparently,
it's in multi-purpose room B.

16:43.475 --> 16:46.233
Okay, no dead bolt.
This is gonna be cake.

16:46.290 --> 16:47.713
How do you know how to do this?

16:47.748 --> 16:49.880
Remember that expose
I did on a grope-y dentist?

16:49.922 --> 16:53.505
Who did you think broke in and hid
in his supply closet for eight hours?

16:53.547 --> 16:57.630
- I had to hydrate with mouthwash.
- You're a badass!

16:57.672 --> 17:00.797
No, honey.
I'm just a man.

17:15.247 --> 17:17.191
There's my photo.

17:17.192 --> 17:21.079
Wow, you look 20 years younger.

17:21.122 --> 17:25.038
- That's me.
- Oh, that's more like it.

17:25.073 --> 17:28.372
Hey, I-I-I mean
that's more... like it!

17:28.406 --> 17:30.622
Okay, just grab it, and let's go.

17:30.657 --> 17:31.747
Well, honey, we
can't just take that one,

17:31.788 --> 17:34.330
she'll know it was us.
We gotta steal a few others.

17:34.372 --> 17:37.455
Uh, seriously?
Okay, if you get her,

17:37.497 --> 17:43.054
- then I'm gonna take this guy.
- Oh, come on. Oof.

17:43.130 --> 17:47.594
Hey, look, he's just creepy.
He's following me around the room.

17:48.997 --> 17:52.497
What's going on here?
Hey, I know you.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.372
Yeah, I'm Mike Henry,
Channel 4 news.

17:54.413 --> 17:56.330
- Look, I can explain...
- No, I meant her.

17:56.372 --> 17:57.705
<i>From the picture. Oh, my God.</i>

17:57.747 --> 17:59.872
Can I get the other guards
in here to come say "hi?"

17:59.913 --> 18:01.580
<i>They'd love to meet you.</i>

18:01.622 --> 18:05.497
Can I ask you a question?
Is he following us around the room?

18:05.532 --> 18:07.997
- No, I don't... uh, no...
- No, just walk that way a little bit.

18:08.032 --> 18:10.163
- Walk that way a little bit.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I see it.

18:10.198 --> 18:11.288
Run!

18:13.330 --> 18:15.421
<i>I can't believe you guys!
You said you were cool with it.</i>

18:15.574 --> 18:18.911
And then, you sneak behind my back?
This is so embarrassing.

18:18.946 --> 18:21.513
Eve, we know you love your class,
but the truth is

18:21.514 --> 18:23.913
we don't want you taking
nude photos anymore.

18:23.955 --> 18:25.729
Why not?

18:26.664 --> 18:30.288
- It was a good question.
- And we finally had a good answer.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.205
- Because we said so.
- What?

18:32.247 --> 18:36.080
- That's not fair.
- Yeah, well, life's not fair.

18:36.122 --> 18:38.080
This went on for 20 minutes.

18:38.122 --> 18:40.247
We hit every parenting
cliché in the book.

18:40.288 --> 18:41.413
And that's the way it's gonna be

18:41.455 --> 18:46.288
- as long as you're living under our roof.
- You guys are so lame!

18:46.330 --> 18:50.913
- I can live with that.
- Yeah, me too.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.606
Are these bubbles?

18:54.288 --> 18:56.913
Whoa, Graham!
What the hell's going on?

18:56.948 --> 18:59.038
<i>Oh, hey, Dad.
I made a bubble room.</i>

18:59.080 --> 19:00.705
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Honey, you can't do that.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.247
- The dishwasher is not a toy.
- You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry.

19:04.288 --> 19:07.080
Whoa, whoa.
Did you just "I'm wrong" me?

19:07.122 --> 19:08.455
Did your Dad teach you that?

19:08.497 --> 19:10.663
- You know I did that?
- I let you do that.

19:10.705 --> 19:11.830
Graham, that doesn't work with me.

19:11.872 --> 19:13.538
- You're grounded.
- Bubble party's over.

19:13.580 --> 19:16.534
<i>Oh, man.
Come on, guys.</i>

19:27.372 --> 19:28.663
Growing up, you always think

19:28.705 --> 19:31.038
<i>you'll do things differently
than your parents,</i>

19:31.080 --> 19:34.038
<i>that you'll be friends with your kids,</i>

19:34.080 --> 19:35.205
<i>treat them as equals.</i>

19:35.247 --> 19:38.447
Hi, sweetie.
Mwah.

19:38.532 --> 19:40.580
<i>Turns out that's easier said than done.</i>

19:40.622 --> 19:42.497
- Where's Ian?
- He's in his bedroom.

19:42.538 --> 19:46.288
- Said he wasn't hungry.
- This is all our fault.

19:46.330 --> 19:51.122
- We have to help him get Reese back.
- Seriously? When does it end?

19:51.163 --> 19:52.580
<i>Come on.</i>

19:56.372 --> 20:00.247
<i>♪ I'm still here ♪</i>

20:03.105 --> 20:06.372
<i>♪ I'll tell you what's
in my field of view ♪</i>

20:06.413 --> 20:09.331
<i>♪ but I've said some
things that I can't undo ♪</i>

20:09.447 --> 20:12.738
Oh, Harris?
What are you doing to me, man?

20:12.780 --> 20:15.001
I knew they were
meant to be together.

20:15.188 --> 20:16.613
I give it a week.

20:16.697 --> 20:19.030
<i>But the truth is we
all need boundaries.</i>

20:19.072 --> 20:23.307
They make us feel safer,
connected, cared for.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.738
And without 'em, we'd have
nothing to rebel against.

20:37.180 --> 20:40.222
- Not bad, huh?
- No, not bad.

20:40.263 --> 20:43.897
And you know, rock stars
always do date models.

20:43.938 --> 20:48.022
Would you mind if I hung
my photo up in our closet?

20:48.063 --> 20:49.397
Would you mind
if I use it for my album cover?
