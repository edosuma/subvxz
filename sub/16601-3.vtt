Janko: This blows.

00:07.931 --> 00:09.706
Yeah, boss said it's
just for a few days.

00:09.708 --> 00:12.442
Movie and TV Unit's got more
work than it can handle.

00:12.444 --> 00:14.871
<i>Dempsey and Kane?</i> I never heard of it.

00:14.891 --> 00:16.846
It's a cop show.

00:16.848 --> 00:19.488
Two female detectives.
The acting's not bad, actually,

00:19.508 --> 00:21.841
but the writing is a joke.

00:23.477 --> 00:24.978
Hey.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.249
Man: All right, so, when these
guys come through the arch,

00:29.251 --> 00:30.683
you're gonna take them at gunpoint...

00:30.685 --> 00:32.435
(clears throat) right...

00:33.087 --> 00:34.286
there.

00:35.593 --> 00:37.003
That's money.

00:37.523 --> 00:38.558
Can we mark this, Joe?

00:38.560 --> 00:40.226
Yeah. It's all yours. Thanks, guys.

00:41.028 --> 00:42.128
Hey.

00:42.130 --> 00:44.230
Can you believe they pay me for this?

00:44.232 --> 00:46.466
Joe Pelligrino,
police technical advisor.

00:46.468 --> 00:48.268
Jamie Reagan. This is my
partner, Eddie Janko.

00:48.270 --> 00:50.336
So, you help the actors

00:50.338 --> 00:51.938
- act like cops?
- Mm-hmm.

00:51.940 --> 00:52.939
Today's audience
is pretty sophisticated,

00:52.941 --> 00:54.140
so we got to get it right.

00:54.142 --> 00:55.942
- Sounds like a pretty good gig.
- Yeah,

00:55.944 --> 00:58.152
but I'd kill to be back
on the job... nothing like that.

00:58.172 --> 00:59.504
Well, hey, what'd you guys
think of the scene?

00:59.524 --> 01:01.931
Pretty good, but the two
detectives were at 12 and six

01:01.951 --> 01:04.186
- when they cornered the perp.
- That's crossfire.

01:04.206 --> 01:05.111
It's kind of dangerous.

01:05.113 --> 01:06.279
Well, that, uh, blocking,

01:06.281 --> 01:08.381
it saves us two setups,
and time is money.

01:08.383 --> 01:10.616
Also, I don't think that
I'd work the street

01:10.618 --> 01:13.227
in heels or a skirt that tight.

01:13.247 --> 01:14.220
Pelligrino: That's a network note.

01:14.222 --> 01:15.554
Those guys write the checks, so...

01:15.556 --> 01:17.156
It's just not very realistic.

01:17.158 --> 01:18.824
Yeah, well, you know,
we got a saying on set:

01:18.826 --> 01:20.126
"We're not making a documentary here."

01:20.128 --> 01:21.827
(chuckles) All right.
Hey, you guys check out

the chicken tacos over at craft service.

01:24.109 --> 01:25.898
Outstanding!

01:28.193 --> 01:30.994
And through the generosity

01:30.996 --> 01:33.564
of Sy Goodman...

01:33.566 --> 01:37.708
the NYPD Second Tour Fund
will provide much needed support

01:37.728 --> 01:41.805
for officers forced to retire
due to line-of-duty injuries.

01:41.807 --> 01:44.841
From financial aid during recovery,

01:44.843 --> 01:48.011
to college tuition supplements
for their families,

01:48.013 --> 01:51.737
to resources required
to jump-start new careers,

01:51.757 --> 01:56.086
the fund provides a safety net
for our bravest comrades

01:56.088 --> 01:58.488

08:07.467 --> 08:10.501
He was clocked doing 95,

in a blacked-out Ford
Police Interceptor Utility.

08:15.874 --> 08:17.742

on the center console.

08:23.683 --> 08:24.749
What?!

08:24.751 --> 08:26.551
For which he has a premise permit

08:26.553 --> 08:27.919
but not a carry permit.

08:28.831 --> 08:32.431
He also played your courtesy
card with the arresting officer.

08:35.163 --> 08:37.929
Look, boss, Goodman and his pals
do a hell of a lot of good.

08:37.931 --> 08:41.232
I mean, no way I swing college

08:41.234 --> 08:42.600
Well, that does not change the fact

08:42.602 --> 08:44.869
that citizens traveling
under lights and siren

08:44.871 --> 08:48.567
is against the law, not
to mention packing a handgun.

08:48.587 --> 08:51.342

happened but a traffic stop.

08:51.344 --> 08:54.579
And we're all set up to just...
look the other way.

08:54.581 --> 08:56.681

09:19.242 --> 09:20.805
We did a little digging, Brandon.

09:20.807 --> 09:23.174
Your old man's got
his own hedge fund, huh?

09:23.176 --> 09:24.876
That's some serious cash.

09:24.878 --> 09:27.745
Which is relevant to this situation how?

09:27.747 --> 09:30.448
We know what your dad does,
Brandon. How about you?

09:30.450 --> 09:32.850
Oh, I'm the black sheep who
squanders his father's fortune

09:32.852 --> 09:34.318
and sullies his good name.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.753
Then you got three priors
for assaulting women.

09:35.755 --> 09:37.522
I'd say that does make
you a black sheep.

09:37.524 --> 09:39.123
Those were misunderstandings.

09:39.125 --> 09:40.291

09:40.293 --> 09:43.928
Emily may look innocent,
but trust me, she isn't.

09:45.297 --> 09:46.497

09:46.499 --> 09:49.734
So being tied up, beaten
and raped was her idea?

09:49.736 --> 09:51.335
- That's not what happened.
- Danny: Let's just say

09:51.337 --> 09:53.438
that Emily was a willing participant

09:53.440 --> 09:54.639
in you assaulting her

09:54.641 --> 09:56.607
and holding her hostage for 12 hours.

My father is worth $3 billion.

10:07.323 --> 10:10.254
Emily asked me for a little
bit of money, I said no,

10:10.256 --> 10:12.824
she got upset, here we are.

10:12.826 --> 10:14.625
Well, now it all makes sense.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.694
You're the victim in this thing.

10:16.696 --> 10:18.463
Yep, happens all the time.

10:18.465 --> 10:21.299
Pro athletes, celebrities...
If you've got money,

10:21.301 --> 10:22.900
you're a target.

10:22.902 --> 10:24.502
I'd feel real bad for you

10:24.504 --> 10:26.671
if I believed a damn word you've said.

10:26.673 --> 10:29.140
I think I'll call my lawyer now.

10:33.078 --> 10:35.613
(sighs)

10:36.782 --> 10:38.249
What I want to know is,

10:38.251 --> 10:40.251
why do they shoot
everything, like, 20 times?

10:40.253 --> 10:41.519
I'm still trying to figure out

10:41.521 --> 10:44.288
what everybody does and
why there's so many of them.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.623
Well, it's probably a union thing.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.925
You guys are real cops, right?

10:47.927 --> 10:49.861
It's tough to tell around here.

10:49.863 --> 10:51.367
Yeah, we're the real deal.

10:51.387 --> 10:53.197
Did you watch the rehearsal
of the next scene?

10:53.199 --> 10:54.532
Where we run into the burning meth den

10:54.534 --> 10:55.766
and bust the gang bangers?

10:55.768 --> 10:57.502
Yeah, we saw it.

10:57.504 --> 10:59.270
Would we really do that?

11:00.439 --> 11:03.007
Well... it's like you guys say,

11:03.009 --> 11:04.942
it's not like you're
shooting a documentary.

11:04.944 --> 11:06.944
(scoffs) I knew it.

11:06.946 --> 11:08.846
These writers are so full of it.

11:08.848 --> 11:10.081
In reality,

11:10.083 --> 11:12.049
unless there was hostages
or bystanders in danger,

11:12.051 --> 11:14.118
you and Dempsey would just let the fire

11:14.120 --> 11:15.987
force the suspects out of
the building, then arrest them.

11:15.989 --> 11:17.468
I'm Dempsey.

11:18.366 --> 11:19.758
Right. Sorry.

11:19.778 --> 11:22.193
I'm in awe of what you guys do.

11:22.195 --> 11:24.228
The risks you take.

11:24.230 --> 11:25.997
You're true heroes.

11:25.999 --> 11:27.465
Thanks.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.567
But seriously,
I have no idea how you live

11:29.569 --> 11:31.402
on that crap money they pay you.

11:41.056 --> 11:42.280
How you feeling, Emily?

11:42.282 --> 11:44.181
Um, okay.

11:44.183 --> 11:46.751
They gave me a little something
to help me fall asleep.

11:46.753 --> 11:48.286
Does your family know you're here?

11:48.288 --> 11:49.987
No. I haven't called them.

11:51.156 --> 11:53.283
I'm not really ready.

11:53.303 --> 11:56.584
Well, we arrested
Brandon Mitchell, Emily.

11:57.454 --> 12:01.165
And the DA is prepared to throw
the book at that scumbag.

12:01.985 --> 12:06.971
And I appreciate that, but I have
decided not to press charges.

12:09.007 --> 12:10.942
We know you've been through a lot,

12:10.944 --> 12:13.544
but Brandon is a bad guy.

12:13.546 --> 12:15.713
You can't let him get away
with what he did to you.

12:15.715 --> 12:17.648
I can't sit in a courtroom

12:17.650 --> 12:20.117
and tell a room full of
strangers what happened to me.

12:20.119 --> 12:21.485
I can't do that.

12:21.487 --> 12:24.121
I'm sorry. I just...

12:26.525 --> 12:28.593
I just want to get on with my life.

12:42.026 --> 12:43.074
Baez: <i>I can't believe she won't testify</i>

12:43.076 --> 12:44.308
against Mitchell.

12:44.310 --> 12:46.777
Well, the bottom line is it's her call.

12:46.779 --> 12:48.045
Well, it's the wrong call.

12:48.047 --> 12:49.547
That bastard needs to
pay for what he did.

12:49.549 --> 12:51.048
I'm not happy about it either, okay?

12:51.050 --> 12:52.550
But everything she said
in there was true.

12:52.552 --> 12:53.684
What?

12:53.686 --> 12:55.486
Well, Brandon Mitchell is a scumbag,

12:55.488 --> 12:57.888
but he's a rich scumbag.
With a pricey lawyer.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.590
And this is ultimately

12:59.592 --> 13:02.326
a he-said, she-said
domestic violence case.

13:02.328 --> 13:03.661
So he should just get a pass.

13:03.663 --> 13:04.929
No, he shouldn't get a pass,

13:04.931 --> 13:07.365
but you and I both know
that he probably will.

13:07.367 --> 13:10.434
But not until after a long,
drawn-out and ugly trial,

13:10.436 --> 13:12.269
in which Emily gets
dragged through the mud.

13:12.271 --> 13:15.406
So if she wants to walk away
from it, it's her call.

13:26.895 --> 13:29.107
Come on. You can't
possibly be surprised.

13:29.127 --> 13:30.756
I'm not surprised; I'm pissed off.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.442
Well, without the victim's testimony,

13:32.444 --> 13:35.278
you can't blame the riding DA
for not wanting to prosecute.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.080
Even if the guy is a scumbag,

13:37.082 --> 13:38.582
like Brandon Mitchell happens to be.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.116
But the guy's got two years on the job

13:40.118 --> 13:41.318
and a major attitude.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.386
And he tells me the
case is a sure loser.

13:43.388 --> 13:45.255
- He's right; it is.
- Whatever.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.523
If we pulled a female DA,

13:46.525 --> 13:47.791
I'm thinking Mitchell gets charged.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.025
Seriously?

13:49.027 --> 13:50.827
You think a man can understand
what Emily went through?

13:50.829 --> 13:53.096
Probably not, but there's
still not enough evidence

13:53.098 --> 13:54.464
for a conviction.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.466
- We'll see about that.
- Erin: Hey.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.902
Hey. What are you doing here?

13:58.904 --> 14:00.637
You didn't tell him?

14:00.639 --> 14:01.872
Tell me what?

14:01.874 --> 14:05.075
I asked Erin to review Emily's case.

14:06.293 --> 14:07.844
Interesting.

14:07.846 --> 14:11.181
It's part of my job to review
the decisions of my riding DAs.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.515
Yeah, that's fine.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.885
It's just that I'm usually looped-in

14:14.887 --> 14:16.386
on things like that.

14:16.388 --> 14:17.954
So what did you think, Erin?

14:17.956 --> 14:19.289
I read the file.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.625
I get why my office
declined to prosecute.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.360
Hmm. Like I said.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.996
But Mitchell has three prior
collars for assaulting women.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.632
And all three victims
withdrew their complaints.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.033
Sounds familiar.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.136
Your office does prosecute
domestic violence cases

14:33.138 --> 14:35.472
- where the victim refuses to testify.
- Yes.

14:35.474 --> 14:38.308
But evidence-based
prosecution is challenging.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.543
The jury likes to have
a face to the crime.

14:40.545 --> 14:42.512
No face, no case.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.548
So Brandon just walks away. Again.

14:45.550 --> 14:47.717
Not without a fight.

14:47.719 --> 14:49.586
It will be a heavy lift,

14:49.588 --> 14:51.988
but I'm charging Mitchell
with unlawful imprisonment,

14:51.990 --> 14:54.991
kidnapping and first degree rape
by forcible compulsion.

14:54.993 --> 14:56.426
Thank you.

14:59.664 --> 15:01.998
What the hell were you two thinking?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.466
Well, what's the problem?

15:03.468 --> 15:05.402
Did you tell Ariel that real cops

15:05.404 --> 15:06.903
would never run
into the burning building?

15:06.905 --> 15:08.772
In that scenario, it would be idiotic.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.473
Idiotic? Okay, for your information,

15:10.475 --> 15:12.509
the script was carefully
vetted for accuracy.

15:12.511 --> 15:13.644
- By who?
- Whom?

15:13.664 --> 15:16.179
Me. And who the hell told you
you could speak to the actors?

15:16.181 --> 15:18.148
- She came to talk to us.
- That's no excuse.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.550
I had to rewrite the entire
meth den sequence.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.918
We ate a tecnocrane...

15:21.920 --> 15:24.220
And now, I've got an entire
stunt crew sipping cappuccino

15:24.222 --> 15:25.555
on golden time.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.357
We really didn't mean to
cause you guys any problems.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.758
That changes nothing.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.928
I've got a Prism award and two
Humanitas honorable mentions.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.196
I don't need a couple

15:33.198 --> 15:35.098
of beat cops telling me
how to write my script.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.734
Hey, Ariel and Kirsten
want to discuss the scene.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.536
Perfect.

15:40.429 --> 15:42.906
That guy plays poker
with the show-runner.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.207
You two really screwed me here.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.009
Look, we're really sorry;
it was not intentional.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.711
Cross me again, you're off this set.

15:47.713 --> 15:48.712
That's not really your call.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.613
Well, then I'll talk to your commander.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.983
I think you mean commanding officer?

15:52.985 --> 15:54.651
Whatever.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.259
(knocking on door, then door opens)

16:04.592 --> 16:07.063
- Sir.
- I know.

16:08.809 --> 16:10.067
Frank.

16:10.087 --> 16:11.434
Sy.

16:12.269 --> 16:13.770
Please don't do that.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.005
Okay.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.107
(door closes)

16:17.109 --> 16:18.675
Thanks for coming up.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.510
Listen, Frank. I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.612
From the bottom
of my heart, I'm really sorry.

16:22.614 --> 16:23.882
I know you are.

16:23.902 --> 16:26.683
I never in a million years
want to put you in a position.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.051
I know that.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.486
Please, sit.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.987
This is nice, huh?

16:30.989 --> 16:32.122
Thank you. It's new.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.289
Yeah, it'd look good in my office.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.557
Do you know where you got it?

16:34.559 --> 16:38.261
Uh, not off-hand, but I could
find out for you, Sy.

16:38.263 --> 16:39.462
Very nice.

16:39.464 --> 16:41.398
They're all business, but they...

16:41.400 --> 16:43.500
still, they come with a...

16:43.502 --> 16:46.036
good amount of support, right?

16:46.038 --> 16:47.937
(sighs)

16:47.939 --> 16:49.354
Sy.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.809
I need you to surrender
your pistol permit.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.879
Ah. Really?

16:55.881 --> 16:59.315
Yes. As I'm sure you're aware,
your premises permit

16:59.317 --> 17:01.851
only allows you to have
a weapon in your home,

17:01.853 --> 17:05.821
not riding shotgun with you,
speeding up the Deegan.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.490
You ever been car-jacked, Frank?

17:08.810 --> 17:11.461
- No.
- I have; in Miami.

17:11.463 --> 17:12.962
Not something you soon forget.

17:12.964 --> 17:14.696
No, you do not soon forget that.

17:14.699 --> 17:16.132
Yeah, I'm, I'm sure.

17:16.134 --> 17:18.701
You don't want to take away my
right to defend myself, do you?

17:18.703 --> 17:23.205
No. I just want you to obey
New York City gun laws.

17:36.949 --> 17:38.849
You know that check from yesterday?

17:38.869 --> 17:41.257
You can't just go deposit that.

17:41.259 --> 17:42.392
I know that.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.560
I mean, you know, it's kind of a symbol.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.361
The actual money comes
in a wire transfer.

17:45.363 --> 17:46.863
- Yes.
- And the other money I give,

17:46.865 --> 17:48.698
money I raise, I don't
just go out in my backyard

17:48.700 --> 17:50.100
and shake a money tree, you know,

17:50.102 --> 17:53.036
I work for that money... hard.

17:53.838 --> 17:55.438
I appreciate your generosity.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.991
You know that.

17:57.687 --> 17:59.802
Then show me the respect.

18:00.311 --> 18:03.012
By disrespecting the law?

18:03.014 --> 18:05.448
By doing a good friend a favor.

18:05.450 --> 18:08.818
It's made the papers;
it's out of my hands.

18:09.647 --> 18:11.321
(sighs)

18:16.492 --> 18:17.994
You have ways.

18:19.100 --> 18:22.499
You need to tread lightly here.

18:30.441 --> 18:35.512
I will do what I can without
compromising this office.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.614
(sighs)

18:48.386 --> 18:50.994
Actions speak louder than words.

18:59.508 --> 19:00.519
I told the police

19:00.539 --> 19:03.173
I don't want to press
charges against Brandon.

19:03.193 --> 19:05.275
This is a criminal case, Emily.

19:05.277 --> 19:07.477
You don't press charges, we do.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.078
And it's the opinion of this office

19:09.080 --> 19:11.814
that Mr. Mitchell is a
threat to the community.

19:11.816 --> 19:14.898
We intend to prosecute him
for what he did to you.

19:15.136 --> 19:16.920
Well, I won't testify.

19:16.922 --> 19:20.539
I don't claim to understand
what you've been through.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.258
But I know if it happened to me,

19:22.260 --> 19:24.060
I would do anything to make sure

19:24.062 --> 19:26.162
that Brandon Mitchell
paid for his crimes.

19:26.164 --> 19:29.599
I know it's the right thing to do.

19:34.046 --> 19:35.805
It's just that...

19:37.107 --> 19:39.371
Will you excuse us for a moment?

19:39.391 --> 19:41.477
Sure thing.

19:46.883 --> 19:48.117
(door closes)

19:48.557 --> 19:50.386
What happened at my apartment
is more complicated

19:50.388 --> 19:52.055
that I told the police.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.790
Complicated how?

19:54.463 --> 19:56.745
Brandon was...

19:57.762 --> 20:02.432
into things that I had
never tried before.

20:03.382 --> 20:04.701
Like bondage?

20:05.629 --> 20:07.870
I let him handcuff me.

20:10.528 --> 20:12.675
We had done it a few times.

20:12.677 --> 20:15.445
But this time was different.

20:17.681 --> 20:22.151
I mean, he started calling
me horrible names,

20:23.446 --> 20:25.321
and hitting me.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.391
It was like he was a different person.

20:29.881 --> 20:32.996
But the truth is...

20:34.765 --> 20:37.212
that I let him do this to me.

20:37.232 --> 20:40.336
So you think because you
initially consented,

20:40.338 --> 20:42.988
that you're responsible
for what happened?

20:43.540 --> 20:46.075
Emily, when things started to go bad,

20:46.077 --> 20:50.346
did you make it clear to Brandon
that you wanted him to stop?

20:50.348 --> 20:53.182
(crying): A hundred times.

20:53.184 --> 20:55.451
That makes him a rapist.

20:55.453 --> 20:56.819
Listen to me.

20:56.821 --> 20:59.922
What happened to you is not your fault.

20:59.924 --> 21:01.758
That may be right,

21:02.614 --> 21:06.729
but all that horrible stuff
is gonna come out at the trial.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.574
In the newspapers.

21:08.594 --> 21:10.633
- Emily.
- I'm sorry.

21:10.635 --> 21:13.253
Ms. Reagan, I can't do this.

21:21.011 --> 21:24.047
If you think of anything else,
please give us a call.

21:24.049 --> 21:26.883
Spoke to the super. There's
nothing on the security cameras.

21:26.885 --> 21:29.952
- Well, it was worth a try, Danny.
- Hey, if you say so.

21:29.954 --> 21:32.288
What's going on with you?
I'm sick of this attitude.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.257
We'll get other cases
to work. And, besides,

21:34.259 --> 21:36.492
there's no point chasing
our tail on this one anymore.

21:36.494 --> 21:38.828
Maybe you didn't hear, but your sister

21:38.830 --> 21:40.430
is charging Brandon Mitchell.

21:40.432 --> 21:41.931
Well, that's because
you pushed the case.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.433
And without even checking with me...

21:43.435 --> 21:46.103
Last time I checked, my shield
is just as gold as yours.

21:46.123 --> 21:47.220
That's not what I meant.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.005
No, you've been very
clear from the beginning

21:49.007 --> 21:51.774
that you don't think this case
is worth pursuing, but I do.

21:51.776 --> 21:53.142
I don't need your permission.

21:53.144 --> 21:54.243
It's not about what I think.

21:54.245 --> 21:56.179
It's about how the system works.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.981
No, Danny, it's about taking
a rapist off the streets.

21:58.983 --> 22:00.683
- I shouldn't have to tell you that.
- (elevator dings)

22:00.685 --> 22:03.086
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going to the hospital

22:03.088 --> 22:05.321
to question the doctors
and nurses that treated Emily.

22:05.323 --> 22:06.489
Come on. I'll drive you.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.991
No, I'll walk.
I could use some fresh air.

22:19.438 --> 22:20.939
(sniffles) My name is,
um, Emily Harrison.

22:20.941 --> 22:25.143
Uh, my boyfriend...
(sniffles) attacked me.

22:25.163 --> 22:28.179
He held me prisoner. Please send
someone before he comes back.

22:28.181 --> 22:31.983
I'm afraid he's gonna
kill me... (crying)

22:32.632 --> 22:34.953
Ms. Harrison made that 911 call
moments after you left

22:34.955 --> 22:36.421
her apartment, Mr. Mitchell.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.223
Ms. Harrison dropped her
complaint against my client.

22:38.225 --> 22:40.358
So, why exactly are we here?

22:40.360 --> 22:43.761
Because Mr. Mitchell has a nasty
habit of brutally assaulting women.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.330
Never been convicted of a crime.

22:45.332 --> 22:46.497
Always a first time.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.199
The victim wants no part
of the prosecution.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.868
Victims can change their mind.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.402
Emily is no victim.

22:52.254 --> 22:54.339
Regardless of how the encounter started,

22:54.341 --> 22:58.149
the moment Ms. Harrison said no,
your actions became unlawful.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.501
Good luck proving that
without victim testimony.

23:00.521 --> 23:02.932
In addition to the 911 tape,

23:02.952 --> 23:06.068
we have compelling
medical evidence of abuse,

23:06.088 --> 23:08.790
the injuries to Mr. Mitchell's hands.

23:08.810 --> 23:10.615
And a statement from Emily's roommate.

23:10.635 --> 23:12.564
Lawyer: Who saw no criminal acts.

23:12.584 --> 23:15.805
The injuries on both my client
and Ms. Harrison prove nothing,

23:15.825 --> 23:17.881
and the 911 tape is pure theatrics.

23:17.901 --> 23:20.414
Your client has never stood
trial, Counselor.

23:20.434 --> 23:22.367
By the time I'm done with him,
the jury's gonna see him

23:22.369 --> 23:26.638
for exactly who he is,
a smug, spoiled sociopath.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.007
- Brandon...
- I don't have to listen to this!

23:29.009 --> 23:30.775
You're gonna want to calm down.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.479
Your client has quite the temper.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.381
Jury's gonna smell that.

23:37.023 --> 23:38.589
We're willing to drop

23:38.609 --> 23:41.252
the imprisonment and kidnapping charges

23:41.254 --> 23:42.921
if Mr. Mitchell pleads guilty

23:42.923 --> 23:44.655
to first degree rape.

23:44.675 --> 23:46.008
Drop the rape charge.

23:46.010 --> 23:48.510
We'll plead to misdemeanor
assault. No jail time.

23:48.512 --> 23:50.613
- That's a joke.
- You're not the only one

23:50.615 --> 23:52.314
who can work a jury, Ms. Reagan.

23:52.316 --> 23:55.618
Even if Ms. Harrison
testifies, I'll paint her

23:55.620 --> 23:58.520
as a predatory sexual fetishist
looking for a pay day.

24:07.497 --> 24:10.466
I actually thought that last
rewrite worked pretty well.

24:10.468 --> 24:12.768
Wasn't that building
supposed to be on fire?

24:12.770 --> 24:15.134
They add that later.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.695
Pelligrino: Glad I caught you guys.

24:16.715 --> 24:19.268
Look, uh, I wanted to apologize.

24:19.288 --> 24:20.509
I know you were just trying to help.

24:20.511 --> 24:23.112
- No problem.
- Thing is, with these Hollywood types,

24:23.114 --> 24:24.813
you always got to watch your back.

24:24.815 --> 24:26.749
- Is that right?
- Oh, you have no idea.

24:26.751 --> 24:29.785
The only thing you can't get on
a TV set is a straight answer.

24:29.787 --> 24:31.186
Well, you should fit right in then.

24:31.188 --> 24:32.588
What's that supposed to mean?

24:32.590 --> 24:35.190
I made a few calls. Turns out
you were never even on the job

24:35.192 --> 24:36.358
with the NYPD.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.193
That explains why you're not making

24:38.195 --> 24:40.462
a documentary around here.

24:41.637 --> 24:43.432
Far as I can tell, you were
in Cranford, New Jersey,

24:43.434 --> 24:46.635
as a patrol officer for eight
months before you got fired,

24:46.637 --> 24:48.971
after which you worked security
at the Willowbrook Mall.

24:48.973 --> 24:51.440
I always felt safe shopping there.

24:51.442 --> 24:54.243
Look, guys, I'm begging you,
don't blow the whistle.

24:54.245 --> 24:55.844
I really need this job.

24:55.846 --> 24:56.879
We're not trying to jam you up.

24:56.881 --> 24:59.014
This is our last day on this assignment.

25:00.483 --> 25:02.685
But millions of people watch this show,

25:02.687 --> 25:05.654
and that affects
how they look at real cops.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.258
Yeah, it'd be nice
if you tried to get it right.

25:12.502 --> 25:14.396
Sean: So you actually
got to watch them shoot

25:14.398 --> 25:16.065
- <i>Dempsey and Kane?</i>
- Yep.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.049
Did you get to meet Ariel Rice?

25:18.069 --> 25:20.069
- Oh, I met her, all right.
- Was she hot in person?

25:20.071 --> 25:22.237
- Lovely.
- No, no, no, wait, wait,

25:22.239 --> 25:23.439
was she just hot

25:23.441 --> 25:24.940
or was she smokin' hot?

25:24.942 --> 25:26.241
She's very pretty.

25:26.243 --> 25:27.849
Did you get her number?

25:29.312 --> 25:31.113
Kirsten's way hotter. Right, Dad?

25:31.115 --> 25:32.848
No, son. Neither of those two

25:32.850 --> 25:35.284
could hold a candle to your mother. Mmm.

25:35.286 --> 25:36.518
Smart man.

25:36.520 --> 25:37.520
- (chuckling)
- I'm sure

25:37.540 --> 25:40.889
they're very intelligent
and talented women, boys.

25:40.891 --> 25:42.291
I've watched the show.

25:42.293 --> 25:44.093
I'd stick with "smokin' hot."

25:44.095 --> 25:45.027
(chuckling)

25:45.029 --> 25:46.228
Hey, Grandpa,

25:46.230 --> 25:47.730
- Yeah.
- That rich guy who was caught

25:47.732 --> 25:49.598
speeding around in a fake cop car,

25:49.600 --> 25:52.125
is he really a pal, like the news said?

25:52.874 --> 25:54.970
No, he is not a pal.

25:54.972 --> 25:57.239
He is a friend of the NYPD though.

25:57.241 --> 25:58.640
But isn't what he did against the law?

25:58.642 --> 25:59.642
Oh, yeah.

26:01.244 --> 26:03.543
Guys like Sy Goodman give
a ton of money to the NYPD.

26:03.563 --> 26:04.729
Yeah, and they don't have to.

26:04.731 --> 26:05.830
He appreciates us,

26:05.832 --> 26:07.966
and he puts his money
where his mouth is.

26:07.986 --> 26:09.267
That doesn't mean he
should be above the law.

26:09.269 --> 26:11.169
He was issued a citation.

26:11.171 --> 26:13.338
Whereas anyone else would've
been taken into custody

26:13.340 --> 26:14.773
and charged with reckless driving

26:14.775 --> 26:16.374
and criminal impersonation.

26:16.376 --> 26:18.877
That would depend on
the arresting officer.

26:18.879 --> 26:21.012
Who was smart enough to know
that he's got friends at 1PP

26:21.014 --> 26:23.148
- and friends for good reason.
- Uh-huh.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.353
There were consequences. I personally
pulled his premises firearms permit.

26:28.927 --> 26:30.814
Jamie: Did he... threaten the officer?

26:31.140 --> 26:32.943
No, uh, it was, um,

26:32.963 --> 26:35.366
a technical thing. Kind of a thin reason

26:35.386 --> 26:36.786
to pull a permit from a Sy Goodman.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.634
Well, he's still a civilian.

26:39.654 --> 26:41.751
A civilian who does a
lot of good for cops.

26:41.771 --> 26:44.975
Henry: Yeah, he does.
And cultivating guys like him

26:44.995 --> 26:47.098
is an important part of the PC's job,

26:47.118 --> 26:49.274
whether he likes it or not.

26:50.979 --> 26:52.834
You got something you want to say, Pop?

26:52.854 --> 26:54.291
I just said it.

26:55.172 --> 26:56.314
Linda: You know, we're lucky.

26:56.316 --> 26:58.483
Most police families live modest lives.

26:58.485 --> 27:01.419
Something happens to them,
it's men like Sy Goodman

27:01.421 --> 27:02.921
that make all the difference.

27:02.923 --> 27:04.756
So just because he supports the NYPD,

27:04.758 --> 27:07.764
he can break the law
whenever he feels like it?

27:07.784 --> 27:10.489
- No.
- Certainly sounds like it.

27:10.509 --> 27:13.024
Next time a cop needs
a bulletproof vest,

27:13.044 --> 27:14.210
are you gonna buy it?

27:14.212 --> 27:15.478
Or, uh,

27:15.480 --> 27:16.579
he needs a surgery

27:16.581 --> 27:18.581
and his, uh, insurance won't cover it

27:18.583 --> 27:21.551
or his kid needs special schooling,

27:21.553 --> 27:22.885
are you gonna write the check?

27:22.887 --> 27:24.354
Pop is right, Nicky.

27:24.356 --> 27:25.622
We have to extend a few courtesies

27:25.624 --> 27:27.924
to a guy like Sy Goodman
for what he does.

27:27.926 --> 27:30.356
It's a small price to pay.

27:30.376 --> 27:32.528
Boy, where did that come from?

27:33.874 --> 27:35.680
Six years on the job.

27:38.681 --> 27:40.003
You know, in a perfect world,

27:40.005 --> 27:41.471
uh, which this is not,

27:41.473 --> 27:43.806
cops would get paid a hell of a lot more

27:43.808 --> 27:45.808
for what they do
and the risks they take.

27:45.810 --> 27:48.277
And, Nicky,

27:49.001 --> 27:50.146
with someone like, uh,

27:50.148 --> 27:53.049
Sy Goodman, it's just
not black and white.

27:53.051 --> 27:54.536
It's, uh...

27:56.930 --> 27:58.554
kind of gray.

28:09.099 --> 28:11.367
Yeah, I-I understand.

28:12.216 --> 28:14.137
Thank you for your call.

28:15.205 --> 28:17.073
Sounds like bad news.

28:17.075 --> 28:19.809
Judge Brenner just dismissed
the charges on Mitchell

28:19.811 --> 28:22.378
based on legal insufficiency.

28:22.380 --> 28:25.114
Mmm. So Brandon Mitchell walks, huh?

28:25.116 --> 28:26.161
Again.

28:26.181 --> 28:29.886
Mm-hmm. Hate to say it, but...

28:29.888 --> 28:31.954
I did tell you so.

28:31.956 --> 28:33.561
What's your problem, Danny?

28:33.581 --> 28:35.224
What are you talking about?

28:35.226 --> 28:37.393
How many times have you
begged me to pursue

28:37.395 --> 28:40.568
a long-shot prosecution because
you wanted justice for a victim?

28:40.588 --> 28:42.632
Well, that was different,
Erin, 'cause, you see,

28:42.634 --> 28:44.300
in those cases, the victim was willing

28:44.302 --> 28:46.002
to step up and take the stand.

28:46.004 --> 28:48.771
Emily Harrison was raped and beaten.

28:48.773 --> 28:50.859
She's traumatized and scared.

28:50.879 --> 28:52.075
I get it.

28:52.077 --> 28:53.209
Do you?

28:53.211 --> 28:55.244
Because you really
aren't acting like it.

28:55.246 --> 28:58.448
Look, even if this thing goes
to trial, you and I both know

28:58.450 --> 29:00.349
that without Emily's testimony,

29:00.351 --> 29:02.885
Mitchell's hotshot
lawyer will get him off.

29:02.887 --> 29:04.754
You're probably right.

29:04.756 --> 29:06.789
But our job is to pursue justice

29:06.791 --> 29:08.291
- for victims
- (sighs)

29:08.293 --> 29:10.293
who have nowhere else to turn.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.595
You know who taught me that?

29:14.832 --> 29:16.299
You did.

29:16.301 --> 29:18.234
What do you want me to say?

29:18.236 --> 29:20.636
Hmm? I mean, you do realize

29:20.638 --> 29:23.506
that I was just investigated
for shooting a serial killer,

29:23.508 --> 29:24.807
right?

29:24.809 --> 29:26.876
I mean, a serial killer, Erin.

29:26.878 --> 29:28.511
I didn't get a thank you

29:28.513 --> 29:31.114
or a "whew, thank goodness
he's off the street."

29:31.116 --> 29:33.916
I almost lost my gun and my shield!

29:36.129 --> 29:38.921
Who's to say it's gonna be
any different now?

29:40.858 --> 29:43.659
What happened to you,
Danny, wasn't fair.

29:44.376 --> 29:46.996
But it's also not
Emily Harrison's fault.

29:46.998 --> 29:50.066
She deserves justice.

29:53.871 --> 29:57.240
(door opens, shuts)

30:02.679 --> 30:05.515
(sighs)

30:10.520 --> 30:11.721
Appreciate you seeing me.

30:11.723 --> 30:14.857
I was surprised
to hear from you, Detective.

30:14.859 --> 30:17.493
I understand Brandon
won't be facing charges.

30:17.495 --> 30:20.056
- Yeah, that's right.
- So why did you want to see me?

30:20.076 --> 30:22.732
Well, I've been thinking
a lot about your case.

30:22.734 --> 30:24.534
(chuckles)

30:24.536 --> 30:26.836
Think I might've let you down.

30:26.838 --> 30:28.805
- How?
- Well, I knew

30:28.807 --> 30:31.307
it was gonna be tough
to nail Mitchell for this.

30:31.309 --> 30:33.409
Especially after I refused to testify.

30:33.411 --> 30:35.378
But that's no excuse.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.581
I should've tried harder.

30:39.616 --> 30:41.884
I guess sometimes
when you've been doing this

30:41.886 --> 30:44.053
as long as I have, you...

30:44.055 --> 30:46.189
you get hung up on the way you think

30:46.191 --> 30:48.191
things are gonna turn out in the end.

30:48.193 --> 30:50.927
Well, I guess I did the same thing.

30:50.929 --> 30:52.895
Looks like we were both right.

30:52.897 --> 30:54.698
Brandon did get away with it.

30:54.718 --> 30:57.466
You see, that's the thing, Emily.

30:57.468 --> 30:59.068
We weren't right.

30:59.070 --> 31:02.038
We had a shot of getting this
son of a bitch off the street.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.273
And even though it was a long shot,

31:04.275 --> 31:06.576
we should've took it.

31:07.379 --> 31:09.070
Well, it's too late now.

31:16.269 --> 31:18.103
- Stanford & Tate.
- Excuse me?

31:18.123 --> 31:19.555
The furniture.

31:19.849 --> 31:21.691
- Oh.
- Stanford & Tate.

31:23.227 --> 31:25.261
- Sy?
- Yeah.

31:25.263 --> 31:29.565
When you... hugged me
at the press conference,

31:29.567 --> 31:34.070
um, if it showed that I was
uncomfortable, I apologize.

31:34.072 --> 31:37.039
Oh, it didn't. I mean, I-I'm
sorry if in any way that I...

31:37.041 --> 31:38.746
Oh, no, you don't have
anything to be sorry about.

31:38.766 --> 31:42.438
You were being very
gracious and, as always,

31:42.632 --> 31:44.313
generous.

31:44.315 --> 31:48.417
It's... just, uh,
kind of one of my things.

31:48.419 --> 31:49.952
- It's a thing?
- Well, ever since

31:49.954 --> 31:53.522
I was ten or so,
I have gone to heroic lengths

31:53.524 --> 31:55.992
to avoid having a birthday party

31:55.994 --> 32:00.630
or anything that, uh,
focuses the attention on me.

32:01.645 --> 32:02.975
Just a thing. I don't know.

32:02.995 --> 32:04.253
You're sharing this with me because?

32:04.273 --> 32:07.241
Because I'd like us to have
some coin with each other

32:07.243 --> 32:09.243
that isn't just based on money.

32:09.245 --> 32:11.912
But it is just based on money, isn't it?

32:12.921 --> 32:17.118
But the real inner circles are
drawn from not just money.

32:17.765 --> 32:19.186
Well, what-what then?

32:19.188 --> 32:21.956
- Sometimes brutal honesty.
- Uh-huh.

32:21.958 --> 32:23.991
When my cops, when...

32:24.791 --> 32:27.646
they see or hear about, oh,

32:28.237 --> 32:29.630
say, a civilian

32:29.632 --> 32:32.967
driving a boss's car,

32:32.969 --> 32:35.903
the lights, the sirens,
the badges... they feel like

32:35.905 --> 32:39.406
they're being made fun of,
and, in a way, disrespected.

32:39.408 --> 32:41.442
I meant no disrespect
when that happened.

32:41.444 --> 32:44.478
You would have no way of
knowing that to them it seems

32:44.480 --> 32:48.716
that the tools that they
use to serve and protect

32:48.718 --> 32:51.285
are being hijacked to jump traffic

32:51.287 --> 32:53.454
to the ballgame or the concert,

32:54.369 --> 32:56.957
or to flash a cannon to settle a beef

32:56.959 --> 32:59.879
that should have been
settled with a 911 call?

33:01.738 --> 33:03.066
And it...

33:03.086 --> 33:06.901
makes them feel the opposite

33:07.404 --> 33:11.572
of how I know
you want them to look at you.

33:12.272 --> 33:13.941
I do. I see. I-I just...

33:13.943 --> 33:15.376
I never thought of it like that.

33:15.378 --> 33:20.514
And that's what the real
inner circles are all about.

33:21.464 --> 33:23.417
Yeah, I know it.
Thank you, Frank. I'm...

33:23.419 --> 33:25.619
I'll lose the lights,
I'll lose the sirens.

33:25.621 --> 33:27.788
(sighs)

33:32.160 --> 33:34.428
(places something on table, taps table)

33:38.018 --> 33:40.000
I am returning...

33:41.636 --> 33:43.804
your premises permit.

33:50.266 --> 33:52.880
Maybe upgraded to a concealed carry?

33:52.882 --> 33:58.057
The incident requires us to put
a pin in that for a while.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.187
Okay. Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

34:00.189 --> 34:02.489
- Good.
- (sighs)

34:02.491 --> 34:04.425
Oh, uh, listen.

34:04.427 --> 34:05.826
This Saturday, we're gonna be throwing

34:05.828 --> 34:07.528
a big barbecue
at the East Hampton house.

34:07.530 --> 34:09.096
A lot of people I'd love you to meet.

34:09.098 --> 34:11.899
Southside Johnny and the Asbury
Jukes are gonna be playing.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.101
I'd love to.

34:16.094 --> 34:17.605
I really would.

34:27.313 --> 34:29.058
I don't know.

34:38.867 --> 34:41.034
(crowd chatter)

34:44.505 --> 34:46.674
(lively chatter)

34:48.909 --> 34:51.145
(lively chatter, dance music playing)

34:55.947 --> 34:57.485
Fancy meeting you here.

34:57.487 --> 34:58.879
Hey.

34:59.328 --> 35:01.362
I want you to know that, um,

35:01.364 --> 35:04.164
I'm real sorry about what happened.

35:04.166 --> 35:06.867
Well, that's in the past. I've moved on.

35:06.869 --> 35:09.003
In that case, can I buy you a drink?

35:10.874 --> 35:12.406
Yeah, why not?

35:19.882 --> 35:23.550
You know, Emily, I really
do care about you.

35:23.552 --> 35:25.093
Uh-huh.

35:25.113 --> 35:27.613
I want to talk about what happened.

35:27.615 --> 35:30.650
Just not here. Someplace quiet.

35:30.652 --> 35:34.954
Can we maybe go back to your place?

35:35.823 --> 35:37.122
Okay.

35:48.222 --> 35:49.936
Danny: Here they come.

35:59.613 --> 36:01.514
(sighs)

36:01.516 --> 36:03.983
I'm really glad we're doing this.

36:03.985 --> 36:05.852
Oh, we should talk about what happened.

36:05.854 --> 36:07.520
Oh, so talk.

36:10.591 --> 36:13.693
Maybe I pushed things a little too far.

36:15.496 --> 36:17.063
Admit it.

36:17.065 --> 36:19.265
Enjoyed yourself a little bit?

36:21.688 --> 36:22.834
Come on.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.905
You liked being treated
like a little whore.

36:25.907 --> 36:29.208
You and I both know
that's what you really are.

36:31.544 --> 36:33.246
The night is young.

36:45.093 --> 36:48.394
We got so much catching-up to do.

36:48.396 --> 36:49.650
(gasps)

36:49.949 --> 36:51.694
You remember these?

36:52.548 --> 36:53.782
You and me...

36:54.736 --> 36:57.236
We're gonna have one hell of a night.

36:59.306 --> 37:01.033
(handcuffs clinking)

37:02.469 --> 37:04.443
You ready to party?

37:04.445 --> 37:05.974
(sighs)

37:11.055 --> 37:14.086
(laughs)

37:16.148 --> 37:17.657
- What's so funny?
- Oh.

37:17.659 --> 37:19.725
Why don't we ask the detectives?

37:20.238 --> 37:22.829
Detective Reagan? Detective Baez?

37:22.831 --> 37:24.597
Damn it.

37:24.599 --> 37:26.065
- Getting all this?
- (Danny stomps)

37:27.863 --> 37:29.869
You didn't really think that I'd fall

37:29.871 --> 37:32.181
for such any easy set-up, did you?

37:32.201 --> 37:34.340
I'm assuming I'm free to go?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.576
Get the hell out of here.

37:39.546 --> 37:40.947
(sighs)

37:40.949 --> 37:42.315
I'm really sorry.

37:42.317 --> 37:44.183
It's not your fault.

37:50.490 --> 37:53.125
(sighs)

38:01.335 --> 38:03.703
Wanted to see us, Sarge?

38:09.532 --> 38:11.917
- (sighs)
- Janko: Is everything okay, Mr. Klein?

38:11.937 --> 38:14.847
Pollen count's killing me. Otherwise,
it's another day in paradise.

38:14.849 --> 38:16.115
Something we can help you with?

38:16.117 --> 38:17.912
We had to fire Joe
Pelligrino this morning.

38:17.932 --> 38:20.052
Did you find out he never
worked for the NYPD?

38:20.054 --> 38:21.287
Really?

38:21.903 --> 38:23.365
- Really.
- Huh.

38:23.385 --> 38:26.559
No, we actually canned him because he
was sexually harassing the extras,

38:26.561 --> 38:28.928
but the fake cop thing...
That's bad, too.

38:28.930 --> 38:30.104
So, why are you here?

38:30.124 --> 38:32.038
Because we need a new tech adviser.

38:32.058 --> 38:33.566
What do you say, Officer Reagan?

38:34.167 --> 38:36.769
- What, me?
- Ariel likes you and,

38:36.771 --> 38:38.771
unless this is all an elaborate ruse,

38:38.773 --> 38:40.840
you actually do work for the NYPD.

38:40.842 --> 38:43.376
Yeah, but I'm not looking to
quit and start a new career.

38:43.396 --> 38:44.869
Thank you for the offer, though.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.213
You read a few scripts,

38:47.215 --> 38:49.607
you, uh, give a few notes,

38:49.627 --> 38:51.660
you show 'em how to hold a gun.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.997
We'll throw in a featured
recurring extra role

38:54.999 --> 38:57.145
and a co-producer credit.

38:58.668 --> 39:00.893
So what do you say, Officer Reagan?

39:01.951 --> 39:03.405
I'll stick to being a cop.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.207
Something tells me it's safer.

39:05.665 --> 39:07.743
Suit yourself.

39:14.234 --> 39:16.181
- Taking off.
- Have a good weekend.

39:16.201 --> 39:17.686
You too. Plans?

39:17.688 --> 39:18.921
Big plans.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.490
- Party in the Hamptons.
- You?

39:21.492 --> 39:24.960
- A barbecue for Sy Goodman.
- Oh.

39:24.962 --> 39:27.963
200 of his friends dying to meet me.

39:27.965 --> 39:29.356
Want to come?

39:30.157 --> 39:32.367
Uh, I could try to move
a few things around.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.636
That's okay, you have your weekend.

39:34.979 --> 39:36.572
That's my job.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.173
I'll take one for the team.

39:38.175 --> 39:41.810
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.011
'Night, boss.

39:43.013 --> 39:44.213
But Garrett?

39:46.235 --> 39:48.147
Team's gonna owe me one.

39:50.421 --> 39:52.087
Yes, sir, I'll get the
word out to the team.

39:52.089 --> 39:53.889
Got to run.

39:53.891 --> 39:54.990
(door closes)

39:54.992 --> 39:56.573
I'll bet.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.896
(sighs)

40:04.834 --> 40:08.070
♪ ♪

40:15.088 --> 40:17.946
I, uh, don't think
I've seen you here before.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.581
It's my first time.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.616
It's a cool place.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.684
A lot cooler now that you're here.

40:22.686 --> 40:24.835
(soft chuckle)

40:24.855 --> 40:26.421
You know,

40:26.423 --> 40:29.158
I don't think that's the guy
you want to be hanging out with.

40:30.806 --> 40:32.172
I'm a cop.

40:33.267 --> 40:34.997
I'm just saying.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.113
He likes to assault women.

40:38.373 --> 40:39.701
Brutally.

40:40.837 --> 40:42.905
That is a good plan.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.573
Smart girl.

40:44.575 --> 40:48.477
Do you intend to follow
me around 24/7, Detective?

40:48.881 --> 40:51.346
No. I don't need to.

40:51.348 --> 40:53.749
You see, when a guy like you walks,

40:53.751 --> 40:55.150
word gets around.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.485
Thank you.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.840
And there are about
30.000 cops in this city.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.774
So, you never know when
one's gonna be watching you.

41:08.531 --> 41:10.295
We'll see you around.
