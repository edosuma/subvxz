My dad left her
for another man.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.444
Something about mom
and a neighbor?

00:09.531 --> 00:11.185
Yeah. It's complicated.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.795
Mom's having an affair.
It's easy for me to say it.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.927
It happened one time
and it's over.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.060
Then, why did our daughter
have to go to Hudson

00:17.147 --> 00:18.496
and drag you back here?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.368
I'm sorry I kissed you,
but I did it because

00:20.455 --> 00:22.587
I thought he should know
how it feels to lose you.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.808
- So when can we go public?
- My kids have to know first.

she moved away to Vermont

It's Christmas in New York

01:06.936 --> 01:08.590

01:08.677 --> 01:11.593
comes the Constance Billard-
St. Jude's bazaar

are the donated items for sale.

you didn't trust me last time

19:34.129 --> 19:35.696
but I actually like you.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.785
'So let's get down to business.'

19:37.872 --> 19:39.308
'What do you have so far?'

19:39.395 --> 19:41.963
Um, I found a first edition
J.L. Hall book.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.400
Original Italian poster
of "The 400 Blows"

19:44.487 --> 19:46.402
and a Montblanc fountain pen.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.838
All very thoughtful.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.189
And all exceed $50.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.625
Right.

19:51.712 --> 19:55.411
Well, Dan's not really
that into things.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.066
Which makes shopping
for him kind of hopeless.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.068
The only thing he wants
for Christmas is snow.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.679
It's not like
I can give him that.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.203
You sure?

20:06.161 --> 20:07.380
[instrumental music]

20:07.467 --> 20:09.120
[Eleanor]
'Happy holidays.'

20:09.208 --> 20:11.862
Oh, welcome. Welcome.
Muah. Muah. Muah.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.951
Oh, I don't know
if you've noticed

20:14.038 --> 20:17.041
we're doing things a little
untraditional this year.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.652
I don't know if you've heard.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.916
I'm designing a line of lingerie
for Victoria's Secret.

20:22.003 --> 20:25.441
I walked into the store, and I
fell in love with this tree.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.791
Isn't that lipstick clever? Hmm?

20:29.053 --> 20:31.578
Good. Have some eggnog.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.754
- Hello?
- 'Hey, it's me.'

20:33.841 --> 20:36.974
So, uh, running into
each other at the school fair

20:37.061 --> 20:38.324
kind of awkward.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.629
I suppose so, especially after

20:39.716 --> 20:41.675
our last phone call.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.894
Rufus, we really
shouldn't be speaking.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.461
No, I know.

20:47.637 --> 20:50.336
But if there's something
you wanna say..

20:50.423 --> 20:52.860
...you should go ahead
and say it.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.645
Is there something
you want me to say?

20:57.691 --> 20:59.432
Rufus..

20:59.519 --> 21:01.085
...why are you calling?

21:01.172 --> 21:02.696
Oh, I..

21:05.612 --> 21:07.570
...just wanted to say
Merry Christmas.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.835
Hope you have a good holiday.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.971
Yes, well..

21:17.058 --> 21:20.888
I'm, um, flying
to Anguilla with Bart tonight

21:20.975 --> 21:24.718
so I'm expecting it
to be a-a great holiday.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.024
One for the ages, in fact.

21:27.111 --> 21:29.288
'Goodnight, Rufus. Goodbye.'

21:31.159 --> 21:32.726
Anguilla.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.293
What is the matter with me?

21:37.470 --> 21:38.427
Bye-bye.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.170
[laughing]
I don't think so.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.694
Oh.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.957
Oh. Excuse me.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.307
What are you doing here?

21:48.394 --> 21:50.309
Well, I was hoping
to see you again.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.876
I thought it great good fortune
that Roman tracked me down

21:52.963 --> 21:56.271
at the skating rink
and extended an invitation.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.751
Oh, well.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.797
En-enjoy t-the party.

22:03.626 --> 22:06.194
How dare you invite
a strange man into my home?

22:06.934 --> 22:08.283
Jack came?

22:10.198 --> 22:12.461
Go talk to him.
Bring vodka.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.767
Roman..

22:13.854 --> 22:15.072
[whispering]
You practically picked him up

22:15.159 --> 22:16.422
off the street.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.032
And then I googled him.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.425
His name is Jack Roth.

22:19.512 --> 22:20.774
He owns a prominent hedge fund

22:20.861 --> 22:23.298
with offices in London
and Barcelona.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.995
And he finds you
very attractive.

22:25.082 --> 22:28.608
Well, that's no excuse

22:28.695 --> 22:30.392
and-and-and I am doing
just fine

22:30.479 --> 22:32.089
without your romantic help.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.614
- Are you?
- Mm-hmm.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.399
Eleanor, we've been friends
for a long time

22:38.792 --> 22:41.403
since before Marc Jacobs
went into rehab.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.318
Friends don't steal

22:43.405 --> 22:45.407
other friends' husbands.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.281
Is Nate there?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.327
Oh. A few hours ago?

22:52.414 --> 22:54.938
A Chuck Bass didn't call
for him, did he?

22:55.025 --> 22:58.333
Uh, never mind.
Did Nate say where he was going?

22:58.420 --> 23:00.640
No, no. Don't, don't disturb
Mrs. Archibald.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.729
Um, I'm sure he's
on his way here now.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.295
Alright. Thank you.

23:11.564 --> 23:14.305
Dorota's gonna kill you if you
get glue on that comforter.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.351
Sorry we've turned your room
into an art studio, B

23:16.438 --> 23:18.397
but the clock is ticking.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.573
I'm done.

23:21.922 --> 23:22.966
Wow.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.404
Oh, my gosh.

23:26.579 --> 23:30.539
Wow. That, that's amazing.

23:30.626 --> 23:34.761
Thank you so much, Vanessa.
This is gonna be...incredible.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.590
Good. I'm glad I could help.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.592
I think he'll really love it.

23:43.857 --> 23:48.862
Vanessa, I think I'd like to
help with this little project.

23:48.949 --> 23:51.517
Would you come and help me find
another pair of scissors?

24:05.879 --> 24:09.012
It's so nice what you're doing
for your friend Dan.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.971
Helping his girlfriend
make his Christmas present.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.843
'Serena is so grateful'

24:13.930 --> 24:16.629
because she likes to see
the best in people.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.110
I like to see the truth.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.069
Yeah? And what's that?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.464
I think you like Dan
a little too much.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.642
Just thought I should let you
know someone's watching.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.472
Merry Christmas.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.781
I'm taking off.
Call me when you're done?

24:38.868 --> 24:40.696
Okay. Where you going?

24:43.482 --> 24:44.787
I'm gonna go check on my daddy.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.049
I thought you were gonna help.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.268
I think my work's done here.

24:47.355 --> 24:48.399
Oh, hello.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.271
- Hi.
- Goodbye.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.751
When you two are done
hiding up here

24:51.838 --> 24:53.404
I'm taking you both
out for dessert.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.797
I can't, mom. I'm busy.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.190
But this is important
for our family.

24:56.277 --> 24:57.757
It'll just be the three of us.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.280
Mom, anytime you say,
"It'll just be the three of us"

24:59.367 --> 25:00.542
it means you're dating
someone new.

25:00.629 --> 25:01.891
Whoever it is, I don't care.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.719
I'll just meet him
at the wedding.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.765
Fine. Fine.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.549
Then I will just tell you
who it is

25:07.636 --> 25:10.073
because you're gonna be seeing
him around from now on.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.553
It's Bart Bass.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.903
- Bart Bass?
- Bart Bass?

25:13.990 --> 25:16.515
Mom, you cannot date Bart Bass.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.212
You just said a moment ago
you didn't care who it was.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.692
That was before I knew
who it was.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.520
He only has
one facial expression.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.565
- He scares me.
- And he raised Chuck.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.393
- That scares me.
- Oh.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.875
Serena, as usual,
you're being overly dramatic.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.181
I'm not marrying Bart.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.401
'This is very casual..'

25:33.488 --> 25:36.970
...and regardless,
I'm not asking your permission.

25:42.802 --> 25:45.021
You know,
when I suggested this plan

25:45.108 --> 25:47.067
I didn't know that
it would entail a robbery.

25:47.154 --> 25:49.112
Hey, hey, hey.
I left a donation.

25:49.199 --> 25:52.028
So it was more of a rescue
than a robbery.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.726
You know, those abandoned trees
in that lot

25:53.813 --> 25:55.118
were just gonna be kindling
the day after Christmas

25:55.205 --> 25:56.250
and this tree that we have here

25:56.337 --> 25:57.947
is gonna be loved and admired.

25:58.034 --> 26:00.907
Oh, yeah. You have a real talent
for spin, my brother. Okay.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.692
I wish I had more talent
for heavy lifting.

26:03.779 --> 26:07.000
Yeah, well, what you're doing
for Serena is really romantic.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.175
I wonder what mom and dad

26:08.262 --> 26:10.220
are getting each other
for Christmas.

26:15.835 --> 26:19.316
I thought that if I got them
under the same roof

26:19.403 --> 26:22.363
that things would go back
to the way they were.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.368
They haven't, have they?

26:27.455 --> 26:28.978
I think
there's a real possibility

26:29.065 --> 26:32.286
that they might split up.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.375
If I hadn't..

26:34.462 --> 26:37.465
...brought her back though
we could've just kept pretending

26:37.552 --> 26:39.249
that she's just in Hudson,
doing her art.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.687
[instrumental music]

26:44.341 --> 26:45.995
You did the right thing, Jen.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.563
Really, you did,
'cause whatever happens now..

26:48.650 --> 26:51.610
...at least, uh, we're not
living a fantasy, you know?

26:55.483 --> 26:57.877
[piano music]

27:03.143 --> 27:05.536
Wonderful party, Eleanor.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.887
So you...ice skate?

27:07.974 --> 27:10.019
Well, occasionally,
with my niece

27:10.106 --> 27:13.501
but she's much more talented
than I am.

27:13.588 --> 27:17.113
Well, I haven't...skated
since...ages

27:17.200 --> 27:19.594
but I used to love it
when I was a girl.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.509
You must have been very
beautiful out there on the ice.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.163
[elevator dings]

27:23.250 --> 27:25.644
[instrumental music]

27:27.428 --> 27:29.430
Excuse me. Merry Christmas.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.432
Merry Christmas.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.173
[chuckling]
Excuse me.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.175
Freddy, what on earth
are you doing here?

27:35.262 --> 27:38.047
- Oh, Roman invited me.
- 'What?'

27:38.134 --> 27:40.571
Freddy, what..
What are you doing here?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.835
He said that you invited him.

27:42.922 --> 27:43.879
What?

27:43.966 --> 27:45.402
[phone beeping]

27:45.489 --> 27:46.665
Freddy.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.190
Roman, explain this.

27:50.277 --> 27:52.235
- I can't.
- It's so true.

27:52.322 --> 27:56.065
How does one explain
the indescribable pull to..

27:56.152 --> 27:59.025
...see an old lover, to feel
that jolt of electricity?

27:59.112 --> 28:02.376
So you couldn't last two days
in town without contacting him?

28:02.463 --> 28:06.119
I can't believe you'd trust
appearances and not me.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.387
Harold, dear, I..

28:13.474 --> 28:15.955
Roman did not invite Freddy.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.044
I think Blair did.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.262
Blair?

28:24.877 --> 28:28.445
Freddy, if you want
to be the featured model

28:28.532 --> 28:31.405
in my spring catalog,
you'd better tell us the truth.

28:32.928 --> 28:36.105
She might have offered
to buy me a cruise..

28:36.192 --> 28:37.193
Oh.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.631
...and renew my gym membership.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.243
Well, you might
as well take that cruise

28:43.330 --> 28:44.810
because you'll be featured
in my catalog

28:44.897 --> 28:47.508
when Hell freezes over.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.771
Now, please, get out.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.773
Thanks for the champagne.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.166
Merry Christmas.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.780
[Gossip Girl]
Looks like daddy's little girl

28:58.867 --> 29:02.218
isn't sugar and spice
and everything nice after all.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.833
I wish you would just slow down
for a second and let her be.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.356
Well, I just can't believe
that Blair would do

29:09.443 --> 29:12.141
something so cruel
and to Roman

29:12.228 --> 29:14.056
who's only ever been
completely kind to her.

29:14.143 --> 29:17.451
It isn't Roman Blair's lashing
out at, it's you.

29:17.538 --> 29:20.062
She was so looking forward
to spending time with you alone

29:20.149 --> 29:23.979
and then you show up
at our doorstep with your lover

29:24.066 --> 29:26.677
without a word of warning.
How did you expect her to react?

29:26.765 --> 29:31.508
Well, I hoped that once we were
together it would all work out.

29:31.595 --> 29:33.554
[scoffs]

29:33.641 --> 29:36.862
I suppose
that was pretty naive.

29:36.949 --> 29:39.995
Blair learned scheming
from her mother

29:40.082 --> 29:43.825
and unrealistic dreaming
from her father.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.567
She tries really hard
to act all grown-up

29:46.654 --> 29:48.351
but don't you be fooled.

29:48.438 --> 29:50.440
She's still a little girl..

29:50.527 --> 29:52.355
...who needs her daddy.

29:56.403 --> 29:57.578
[Dan grunts]

30:00.450 --> 30:02.104
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.324
Ow.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.892
Okay. What now?

30:06.979 --> 30:08.676
Now, you go in there,
you distract Dexter

30:08.763 --> 30:10.156
the humorless concierge

30:10.243 --> 30:12.375
while I try
and sneak this into an elevator.

30:12.462 --> 30:15.204
Alright, um, who's gonna
turn you into Hercules?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.640
You can't carry
this thing by yourself.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.555
I didn't, I did not say
the plan was foolproof.

30:18.642 --> 30:20.906
Yeah.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.473
Hey, Ms. Van der Woods,
uh, Lily. Hi.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.171
- Dan. Jenny.
- 'Hi.'

30:25.258 --> 30:28.174
- Tree.
- Yeah, um..

30:28.261 --> 30:31.003
They don't allow
Christmas trees inside

30:31.090 --> 30:32.613
which is why we're out here.
