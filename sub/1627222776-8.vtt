00:12.721 --> 00:18.852
There was once a gifted Black girl
who nobody could see or hear.

00:19.853 --> 00:26.151
No matter how loud she yelled,
she was always a girl without a voice.

00:27.778 --> 00:32.073
When Rose Gil was a teenager,
scraping by on the streets of LA,

00:32.156 --> 00:35.953
her talents as a writer
and a visual artist

00:36.036 --> 00:39.289
blossomed into undeniable genius.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.251
But nobody noticed.

00:42.334 --> 00:46.296
Was it because of her gender? Her race?

00:46.380 --> 00:51.134
Was it the mental illness
that was beginning to grip her mind?

00:51.218 --> 00:55.973
Whatever the reason, Rose was invisible.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.560
But the truth is, she did have a voice.

00:59.643 --> 01:05.774
But that voice was stolen
by someone she loved like a sister.

01:05.858 --> 01:12.281
Micah Keith stole Rose Gil's painful
but powerful story of survival

01:12.364 --> 01:14.408
and repackaged it as her own,

01:14.491 --> 01:17.870
knowing that even if Rose tried
to call her out,

01:17.953 --> 01:23.500
she would just be an angry, unhoused,
mentally ill Black woman

01:23.584 --> 01:25.878
that no one would believe.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.922
The audacity is profound.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.634
The damage… lifelong.

01:34.178 --> 01:39.808
Besides Rose, there was one other person
who knew of Micah's long con.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.269
Holt Rollins.

01:43.061 --> 01:47.858
He was also privy to the secret
that launched her into the stratosphere,

01:47.941 --> 01:52.070
and it was his job
to protect it at all costs.

01:52.654 --> 01:57.743
Two days ago, Rollins attempted
to silence Rose for good.

01:58.410 --> 02:03.624
Did he act alone to protect the secret
of a woman to whom he's devoted his life?

02:04.208 --> 02:09.045
Or did he operate on orders from Micah?

02:10.380 --> 02:12.007
One thing seems clear.

02:12.090 --> 02:16.011
The mere possibility
of Rose's story coming to light

02:16.094 --> 02:22.226
was a threat to a woman
whose identity is built on a lie.

02:23.477 --> 02:28.815
On this episode of Reconsidered,
we'll trace two stolen lives.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.194
Rose Gil and Joshua Keith.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.143
This is a tidal wave. I mean…

03:46.727 --> 03:48.812
People shouldn't hear
Rose's story from me.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.982
How am I any different if I speak for her?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.818
You have to. 'Cause right now
she can't speak for herself.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.654
I'd be on firmer ground
if I hadn't lost the damn recorder.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.490
You're a journalist, Poppy.
You are the recorder.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.827
She didn't tell me
what happened after Josh heard the truth.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.540
Okay. What do you wanna do?

04:12.586 --> 04:17.007
Josh, Ramon, Rose were all targeted

04:17.089 --> 04:20.385
because they knew a side of Micah
she hid from the public.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.888
And we know
Holt was behind all those attacks.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.515
Except maybe Joshua.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.934
Holt was just the weapon.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.895
Micah pulled the trigger.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.440
If Rose can't talk, maybe Holt will.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.609
I'll see if I can get you into the jail.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.321
Hey. Mitri's here.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.699
He said if you keep him waiting,
he's gonna take it out of your retainer.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.289
Hey.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.458
Hello.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.877
I need your signature on that.

04:57.005 --> 05:01.468
Tell me I will not have to think about
the lawsuit after this hearing.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.929
-Best-case scenario?
-Please.

05:04.012 --> 05:07.099
The judge grants us a continuance
on the mediation you bailed on.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.934
Markus got shot.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.604
You and Alana get in a room, make nice.
An apology wouldn't hurt.

05:12.688 --> 05:15.023
A lot of times
that's all people want out of a lawsuit.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.568
I'm not apologizing for doing my job.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.278
That ain't best-case scenario.

05:26.535 --> 05:30.038
The judge calling us into the courtroom
for a routine motion to reschedule.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.540
That's not a good sign.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.170
Well, I know you'll work your magic.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.506
You save that sugar for the judge.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.926
-You go wash that bowl.
-Okay. All right.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.143
-He give you anything?
-Not really.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.855
I got press calling me
day and night asking for comment.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.441
-I understand.
-I don't think you do.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.871
I want her in custody. Today.
The DA is ready to bring charges.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.916
This isn't righteous.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.169
Righteous?
You wanna use that word with me?

06:17.252 --> 06:20.255
-I'm not ashamed of anything I've done.
-You should be.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.759
You shouldn't even be a cop.
But here we are.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.596
I told you what would happen
if you let that reporter get involved.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.056
The media is having a field day.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.975
This whole thing is becoming
an embarrassment to the department.

06:32.059 --> 06:35.354
Now, you've had enough time.
Wrap this by the end of the week.

06:43.362 --> 06:47.241
No, I know what it looks like. I do.
Please trust--

06:47.324 --> 06:50.327
-Hang up.
-Excuse me. I'm gonna call you back.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.996
-I need to talk to you.
-What is it? I'm busy.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.206
Listen.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.417
For the millions who think they know her,

06:57.501 --> 07:00.254
Micah Keith's life is an inspiration.

07:00.337 --> 07:04.216
But the visionary artist
celebrated as a beacon of self-empowerment

07:04.299 --> 07:06.718
is not the woman she pretends to be.

07:06.802 --> 07:10.097
On the next Reconsidered:
"Unmasking an Ic"--

07:10.848 --> 07:13.141
I know, I heard it.
What do you think I've been doing?

07:13.225 --> 07:16.436
Some of the board members are asking
if they need legal protection.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.688
Because of a podcast?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.065
Holt's arrest is still playing
on the news.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.735
Ramon and Josh's deaths have
the staff concerned for their safety.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.656
Poppy's turning everyone
against each other. This is all her fault.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.200
Are you all right?
'Cause I need you focused right now.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.119
Maybe I need to slap her
with another lawsuit.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.496
-A cease and desist. Libel.
-No, Micah? Micah.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.249
There is a meeting
with the board in a few days.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.127
They're questioning your ability to lead.
You listening to me?

07:40.210 --> 07:43.797
-Just need to find out how much she knows.
-What she knows about what?

07:47.885 --> 07:48.886
Markus?

07:50.596 --> 07:55.559
Hi, Markus. Zarina. I heard what happened.
I thought you'd still be in the hospital.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.643
He should be.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.396
It's not like the bullet's
gonna get any smaller laying in a bed.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.606
They left it in?

08:00.689 --> 08:02.191
Yeah, it's done its damage.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.818
There's no use risking surgery
at this point.

08:04.902 --> 08:08.322
And don't even bother telling me
you didn't mean for this to happen.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.365
I didn't ask you to go with Poppy.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.288
Markus, what is she planning?

08:19.708 --> 08:22.336
-Are you fucking kidding me right now?
-Let's go. Let's go.

08:29.593 --> 08:33.263
Is municipal architecture your jam, or is
there another reason we're meeting here?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.974
Ah, no. I have a deposition in 15 minutes.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.100
Look…

08:39.770 --> 08:42.147
I'm afraid something bad's
gonna happen to Rose.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.067
-I don't think Holt's done with her.
-He's locked up.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.110
But Micah could bail him out.

08:47.736 --> 08:51.490
Rose's story is the reason
Josh and Drew were killed.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.451
Micah would do whatever it takes
to keep that quiet.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.161
What?

08:56.245 --> 08:59.331
I'm placing Rose in custody
for the murder of Joshua and Drew.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.917
-Why?
-Rose was in touch with Josh.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.462
We found a deleted email
on Joshua's account, threatening his life.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.174
She was also cited for stalking Micah.
It got violent.

09:09.258 --> 09:11.552
Micah had to take out a restraining order.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.556
We believe Rose told Josh her story.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.851
And when Josh stopped her
from going public with her accusations,

09:18.934 --> 09:20.269
she killed him.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.522
Drew was in the wrong place, wrong time.
She panicked. She ran.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.651
-You're making a mistake.
-Well, it's a mistake, or it's my job.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.528
You can get another job.

09:37.244 --> 09:40.414
Haven't seen Aaron
around the shop lately. He still riding?

09:40.497 --> 09:43.667
He broke his leg cleaning the rain gutter.
Weekend warrior.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.795
I mean, tell him to come play poker
with us at The Knock.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.715
-Okay, I will.
-My client knows her way around a bike.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.717
Don't you, Ms. Parnell?

09:54.052 --> 09:57.514
Can't remember the last time I rode,
but yes.

09:57.598 --> 09:58.891
Nothing beats that rush.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.934
Oh, shit.

10:01.685 --> 10:02.728
What?

10:02.811 --> 10:06.815
Julia Frank. Big gun.
They call her Ms. Desert Eagle.

10:06.899 --> 10:10.611
Usually only represents
high-profile cases, but it's okay.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.369
Your Honor, my client, Alana Cave.
Alana, this is Judge Sandy Marshall.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.829
Good afternoon, Your Honor.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.581
Thank you.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.376
Shall we begin?

10:26.460 --> 10:29.796
Your Honor, if you will.
The plaintiff has hired new counsel.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.090
Request to postpone today's motion

10:32.174 --> 10:34.510
so that I may speak
to her new representation.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.346
We proceed as scheduled, Mr. Roche.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.266
Ms. Parnell, I've reviewed your motion.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.437
I appreciate the extenuating circumstances
of your absence last week.

10:45.521 --> 10:49.316
But the fact that you missed a court date
to engage in a dangerous activity,

10:49.399 --> 10:51.193
risking the safety of those around you,

10:51.276 --> 10:53.570
and without regard
for your obligation to this court

10:53.654 --> 10:55.822
where your professional conduct is
in question…

10:57.157 --> 10:59.409
that indicates
an egregious lapse in judgment.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.413
-But Your Honor, I-- I--
-You requested the mediation, did you not?

11:03.497 --> 11:06.083
I am denying your request for continuance.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.461
The discovery phase of this suit
will proceed to deposition as scheduled.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.131
-Don't.
-Alana?

11:14.299 --> 11:17.636
Alana, please. What is this?

11:18.929 --> 11:22.391
It's what I have to do. For my family.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.102
I care about what happened to you.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.439
Believe me, I'm doing everything I can
to do things differently,

11:29.523 --> 11:31.108
so people don't get hurt.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.320
What's my son's name?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.117
You haven't changed.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.163
That's why I'm doing this.
And I'll take all the help I can get.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.257
What was that?

11:55.883 --> 11:57.926
I know her son's name. Henry.

11:58.969 --> 12:02.014
She just caught me off guard, that's all.
Henry Cave.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.060
They're gonna use that exchange
against us.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.855
Now, during your little parley,
did you figure out

12:09.938 --> 12:12.816
how the heck Alana Cave
can afford someone like Julia Frank?

12:25.204 --> 12:28.081
-Hello?
-You hired lawyers in the Cave lawsuit?

12:28.957 --> 12:31.668
-Good evening, Pop-Tart.
-This isn't a game, Micah.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.753
No.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.963
It's survival.

12:35.047 --> 12:39.051
If you let the world know
what I did to Rose, I lose everything.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.053
But you have it coming.

12:41.136 --> 12:44.848
Then why haven't you released
the podcast yet? Why wait?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.142
-I'm working on it.
-You're stalling.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.895
You're trying to punish me.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.775
But what I did to Rose is nothing
compared to what you did.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.360
That's a threat.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.654
It doesn't have to happen like this.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.907
I just wanna find out
who Josh's killer is.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.326
Well, they arrested Rose.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.453
-They think she did it.
-What?

13:08.038 --> 13:10.207
-When?
-Call off the lawyers.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.708
I can't do that.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.046
Then it's survival. As you say.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.508
Should you be driving?

14:02.134 --> 14:03.343
You got a sec?

14:04.553 --> 14:05.554
Yeah.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.895
So…

14:15.564 --> 14:18.358
I think I'ma try to press charges
against the cop that shot me.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.865
Okay, a former cop going after
the department?

14:24.948 --> 14:26.366
That could be a serious mistake.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.243
-And when this happens again?
-I get it.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.120
But you wanna put your life on display?

14:30.204 --> 14:33.498
'Cause when that machine starts rolling,
it will crush you.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.585
And what about you?

14:37.628 --> 14:41.381
Poppy told me that y'all arrested Rose.

14:41.465 --> 14:45.677
And I'm guessing that you're under fire
for not solving the case fast enough.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.682
Look, we either let the machine crush us…

14:52.809 --> 14:54.186
or we do something about it.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.409
-Hey, Herbie.
-Hey, Poppy.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.703
Moss.

15:11.787 --> 15:13.705
Already putting your stamp on things?

15:15.165 --> 15:18.961
Unc took me down to the bike shop.
Y'all have some treasures gathering dust.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.796
This is a bar, not a museum.

15:20.879 --> 15:25.425
I like it. We got a long history,
and some folks got short memories.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.555
Nobody's forgetting the Capstones.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.100
How you feeling, Daddy?

15:33.934 --> 15:36.311
Same as when I started
that clinical trial.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.191
That means you're not getting any worse.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.235
Not that we can tell.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.698
-Can we talk?
-Speak your mind.

15:50.868 --> 15:55.873
Micah knows something
that might blow up my life.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.207
All our lives.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.459
What?

16:01.086 --> 16:03.297
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

16:05.299 --> 16:09.219
It's bad enough with
what everyone close to me is going through

16:09.303 --> 16:10.888
with this damn lawsuit.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.643
Are you asking my permission to quit?

16:19.605 --> 16:21.690
You need to finish this.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.318
We are strong. We will survive.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.363
She knows so much about all of us.

16:28.447 --> 16:31.033
Which is why she wrapped you
into all of this.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.618
She had a trump card.

16:34.912 --> 16:38.373
Could always keep me in line
with the secrets that she holds.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.250
How does that make you feel?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.253
Like burning it down.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.455
How long is she even staying with us?

18:01.456 --> 18:03.041
Are you girls okay?

18:06.295 --> 18:07.629
What--

18:07.713 --> 18:09.965
What happened?
What are you doing out here?

18:11.425 --> 18:13.135
Go. Go call the police.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.973
Okay. Okay. You're okay.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.601
Are you out here with any adults?

18:21.101 --> 18:23.770
-Her babysitter.
-Where's your babysitter?

18:26.815 --> 18:30.068
It's okay, you can tell me. What's wrong?

18:39.328 --> 18:42.122
This investigation has put
a vulnerable woman

18:42.206 --> 18:44.458
in a precarious legal position.

18:45.334 --> 18:49.338
She's under suspicion for a crime
I don't believe she committed.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.757
But the truth is,

18:52.716 --> 18:56.887
I can't say for sure
that Rose isn't Josh's killer.

18:58.013 --> 19:02.226
And I can relate to the desperation
she might have felt after being…

19:05.312 --> 19:07.147
robbed of her voice.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.700
You have a lot of nerve.
You know you were wrong about Rose.

19:18.784 --> 19:19.952
I know.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.663
Then why are you going after her?

19:23.288 --> 19:24.414
Aames.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.085
Three years ago, I--

19:29.878 --> 19:32.339
I got called to a house
out in the Excelsior.

19:32.422 --> 19:36.802
There was a kidnapping suspect
rumored to be there.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.973
The whole thing felt off
the moment I got there, but I--

19:42.182 --> 19:43.642
I wanted him.

19:44.977 --> 19:48.230
So I just buried my instincts,
and I dove into the case.

19:50.858 --> 19:53.527
And it went bad. It went real bad.

19:56.405 --> 19:59.783
There was a lot of scrambling,
a lot of ass-covering

19:59.867 --> 20:02.744
after the suspect got away
and a young girl died.

20:03.829 --> 20:07.374
I remember this. It was all over the news.
That was you?

20:09.877 --> 20:11.545
From the outside, yeah.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.630
I was the fall guy.

20:13.714 --> 20:16.008
I took the blame
for department-wide mistakes.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.802
I was fired without ceremony,
so I fought it.

20:20.554 --> 20:24.766
Took the department to court for
wrongful dismissal, and I won.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.688
They all expected me
to take the settlement,

20:29.771 --> 20:32.900
ride off into the sunset
with my ill-gotten gains.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.653
But you went back to work.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.406
To rub their faces in it every day.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.951
Sounds like something I would do.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.537
Rose is awake.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.667
You wanna speak to her, be at the hospital
first thing in the morning.

20:50.751 --> 20:53.420
I will stall her transfer
to incarceration.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.257
The department wants
this whole thing wrapped up.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.428
For Christ's sake, Poppy,
just say thank you.

21:02.471 --> 21:03.555
Thanks.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.524
Poppy Parnell, press.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.701
How you feeling?

21:26.245 --> 21:28.330
I wanna finish our conversation.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.632
Can I get you anything? Water?

21:39.758 --> 21:40.759
It's okay.

21:43.095 --> 21:44.179
Take your time.

21:48.851 --> 21:51.395
I had never been in such a good place,

21:51.478 --> 21:55.566
finally getting my life back together,
when Joshua invited me to that party.

21:56.859 --> 21:58.652
He invited you to Micah's benefit?

22:00.279 --> 22:03.574
I could see inside the building
where they were having it.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.203
Everyone looked so beautiful.

22:11.206 --> 22:14.668
I saw my work. My art.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.671
Hanging everywhere.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.010
It was perfect.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.762
I felt like I was going to a premiere.

22:27.848 --> 22:30.475
Only it was gonna be
the premiere of my life.

22:32.561 --> 22:34.688
My life was gonna be mine again.

22:38.192 --> 22:41.403
He promised that Micah would tell
everybody who I was.

22:44.031 --> 22:46.450
In front of all the cameras and reporters,

22:48.160 --> 22:49.953
she was gonna admit what she did.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.834
Micah must've got in his head.

22:57.169 --> 22:58.795
He changed his mind.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.547
What do you mean?

23:03.675 --> 23:05.385
After, I waited for him.

23:07.596 --> 23:11.600
He said he needed more time to get
his life in order before we did anything.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.646
That must've been
when he reconnected with his son.

23:16.355 --> 23:21.652
I think he was getting ready to leave her,
but somehow she changed his mind.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.241
When I got to the party,

23:28.158 --> 23:32.037
they had security escort me out
like a criminal.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.748
He got what he deserved.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.502
He betrayed me, just like Micah.

23:41.129 --> 23:46.134
Rose, did you see Joshua
after you left the party?

23:46.885 --> 23:50.472
The police said you sent him emails.
Threatened him.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.558
He always got threats.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.852
Because of his documentary.

23:57.563 --> 24:01.775
He was my last hope
of someone speaking up for me.

24:08.407 --> 24:11.118
Excuse me, Officer.
My name is Micah Keith.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.661
I'm an old friend of Rose Gil.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.788
And I was wondering if I could go in and--

24:14.872 --> 24:16.957
-Let her in.
-Rose, I…

24:24.798 --> 24:26.383
Let her in.

24:48.405 --> 24:51.074
I'm so sorry this is happening to you.

24:55.579 --> 24:58.081
I didn't want this.
I want you to know that.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.751
I wanted to help people…

25:03.670 --> 25:04.671
like you and me.

25:08.175 --> 25:12.346
I will never forget what you did to me.

25:25.526 --> 25:26.944
Hey, you okay?

25:32.324 --> 25:36.078
Poppy Parnell had her eyes on Owen
as the suspect from day one.

25:37.663 --> 25:38.664
It's plain as day.

25:39.373 --> 25:42.793
She wanted to bury him, and she did.

25:42.876 --> 25:43.877
He killed himself

25:43.961 --> 25:46.755
because Poppy told the world
he was a villain.

25:47.548 --> 25:52.052
She slandered his name,
his reputation, with no consequence.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.388
Why should she get a pass?

25:55.013 --> 25:59.560
I was arrested and searched,
but Poppy didn't order the arrest.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.979
That was all Owen Cave and his department,

26:02.062 --> 26:04.481
and I'm not gonna sit here
and let you pin it on Poppy.

26:04.565 --> 26:08.861
The fans of Reconsidered dug up
every detail of my life.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.322
You know, I can withstand

26:12.406 --> 26:15.826
the scrutiny of having our private lives
replayed for the public.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.997
But my daughter?
She doesn't deserve that scrutiny.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.332
Okay, thank you for your testimony.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.937
-No touching, ma'am.
-'Kay.

26:52.571 --> 26:53.864
Is she dead?

26:54.364 --> 26:55.699
No.

26:57.242 --> 27:00.329
But she was arrested
for Joshua and Drew's murder.

27:02.581 --> 27:04.333
-But she didn't--
-I know.

27:07.377 --> 27:10.297
I guess it's just what it is.

27:11.590 --> 27:13.383
What will happen to her?

27:17.262 --> 27:18.347
That's not our problem.

27:25.354 --> 27:28.774
You need to make sure
you have people around you you can trust.

27:31.777 --> 27:32.903
Why are--

27:34.112 --> 27:35.531
Why are you saying that?

27:35.614 --> 27:38.242
I can't always be by your side.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.451
Don't say that.

27:39.535 --> 27:40.869
-It's the truth.
-But--

27:44.081 --> 27:47.000
Do you remember
when I gave you one of these?

27:47.709 --> 27:52.965
You were having those panic attacks,
and we just couldn't calm you down?

27:53.048 --> 27:54.591
And I put this on your wrist,

27:54.675 --> 27:59.012
and I'd snap,
just to remind you you were alive.

27:59.638 --> 28:00.973
That you mattered.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.229
Did you love me
when you were married to him?

28:15.904 --> 28:17.614
I will handle this.

28:19.575 --> 28:21.159
Holt.

28:22.619 --> 28:25.330
Please trust me, okay?

28:25.414 --> 28:27.207
Holt. Holt.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.459
Don't say anything.

28:29.543 --> 28:31.587
I need you. Okay?

28:39.261 --> 28:40.554
Let's go.

28:41.138 --> 28:42.347
Holt.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.741
You said Micah would be here.

29:00.824 --> 29:03.160
-Where is she?
-She's coming, I promise.

29:03.243 --> 29:05.996
Is she fit to lead or not?
That's all any of us wanna know.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.122
I can assure you--

29:07.206 --> 29:11.668
Or is there someone else
who can take the reins at Shelter?

29:21.595 --> 29:22.763
Me.

29:24.181 --> 29:27.935
If you're asking me if I can do this job,
then the answer is yes.

29:28.018 --> 29:29.228
Yes, I can.

29:29.311 --> 29:31.271
Then let's move on that.

29:34.525 --> 29:36.360
Has the department issued an apology?

29:36.443 --> 29:38.487
Have you spoken
to the officer that shot you?

29:38.570 --> 29:40.072
Were you investigating on your own?

29:40.155 --> 29:41.156
Good afternoon.

29:43.700 --> 29:49.289
First and foremost, I wanna thank everyone
for being here in support.

29:50.749 --> 29:57.005
Last week, while in pursuit of a killer,
I was shot by a police officer.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.759
The bullet is still lodged in my leg.

30:01.927 --> 30:05.806
Now, in light of his negligent actions,

30:05.889 --> 30:08.016
I'm here to say that I'm demanding…

30:10.143 --> 30:15.065
that this officer involved be accountable
for his criminal behavior.

30:17.276 --> 30:22.614
As a former officer myself,
this is not something I take lightly.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.244
But… my duty is not just to the badge,

30:28.078 --> 30:29.663
it's to my community.

30:30.706 --> 30:35.544
It's to my family.
My wife and my daughter.

30:37.296 --> 30:38.297
It's…

30:39.965 --> 30:41.300
Come here, sweetheart.

30:42.384 --> 30:49.224
It's my responsibility to restore
her trust in an institution

30:49.308 --> 30:51.435
I was once willing
to lay my life down for.

30:54.313 --> 30:55.856
I thank you for your time.

31:05.407 --> 31:07.951
Hey, Poppy. You got a minute?

31:09.119 --> 31:10.412
What's going on?

31:11.413 --> 31:14.082
Holt's ready to talk. To you.

31:29.056 --> 31:31.975
So I guess
whatever I say to you becomes evidence?

31:33.477 --> 31:34.978
You called me in.

31:35.062 --> 31:38.815
I'm just here to listen to your story.

31:40.317 --> 31:43.278
You've been prosecuting me
ever since you said my name on your show.

31:43.362 --> 31:44.905
You really think there's any chance

31:44.988 --> 31:47.699
I'm gonna get an unbiased jury
after the things that you said?

31:47.783 --> 31:51.203
That wasn't you fleeing
the scene of Ramon's murder?

31:51.954 --> 31:53.914
Wasn't you sleeping with Micah?

31:53.997 --> 31:55.666
Wasn't you who attacked me?

31:55.749 --> 31:58.836
Wasn't you who tried to kill Rose,
got my friend shot?

32:00.379 --> 32:02.673
Exactly what did I get wrong?

32:03.257 --> 32:04.967
Now, you wanted to talk.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.094
So talk.

32:11.807 --> 32:15.894
You have to understand that everything
I did, I did of my own choosing.

32:17.855 --> 32:19.398
No one put me up to it.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.024
Okay.

32:22.276 --> 32:24.403
Rose didn't kill Josh and that kid.

32:24.486 --> 32:26.196
How do you know that?

32:26.822 --> 32:28.240
'Cause I did.

32:30.826 --> 32:31.827
Why?

32:33.662 --> 32:34.997
Josh was angry.

32:35.747 --> 32:37.833
Rose told him Micah was just a fraud.

32:37.916 --> 32:40.878
She was scared of what he was gonna do,
so I stepped in.

32:47.676 --> 32:49.928
Finding Micah when I did was like…

32:52.472 --> 32:53.891
finding a lifeline.

32:54.641 --> 32:58.103
She could see the brokenness in me,
and she pieced me back together.

32:59.813 --> 33:01.857
Is that what tied you to her?

33:03.692 --> 33:05.110
Is that what tied you?

33:07.487 --> 33:09.156
Micah invented Rose.

33:09.740 --> 33:12.367
And then she set out to change the world,
which she did.

33:12.451 --> 33:14.203
And Josh got jealous.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.039
Josh had his own success.

33:17.122 --> 33:19.625
But he was married to a woman
who was more successful.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.919
The way he shit-talked her,
I had to shut him up.

33:22.002 --> 33:23.420
So you shot him?

33:24.838 --> 33:28.217
Micah used to complain that he kept
a gun hidden in that blue trunk.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.885
So I went in, and I got it.

33:32.429 --> 33:36.308
I'm sorry the kid came in.
I'm sorry what I did to him.

33:38.435 --> 33:39.895
So you regret that?

33:41.104 --> 33:42.648
You're using what happened to Micah

33:42.731 --> 33:44.650
to prove what a righteous reporter
you are.

33:44.733 --> 33:46.652
She told me about you.

33:47.861 --> 33:49.071
What you did.

33:59.665 --> 34:01.959
Drew. That's the kid's name, right?

34:03.961 --> 34:05.337
Prison's where I belong,

34:05.420 --> 34:08.715
if for no other reason
than I took that kid's life away.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.848
I just can't get Holt's words
out of my head.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.600
There's something about it
that just wasn't right.

34:18.684 --> 34:21.895
-Talk to me.
-Well, he was off.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.313
The whole thing was.

34:23.397 --> 34:25.732
I mean, why confess now?

34:28.068 --> 34:30.904
He didn't want Rose
to take the fall for it.

34:30.987 --> 34:34.949
He felt guilty about what he did.
What they did.

34:35.033 --> 34:37.661
Yeah, and he's already going down
for Ramon's murder.

34:38.286 --> 34:41.039
So he confesses to save Rose.

34:59.016 --> 35:00.392
The trunk was locked.

35:01.185 --> 35:04.605
He was even detailed enough
to put it in his dollhouse version.

35:05.856 --> 35:08.942
Holt said he took the gun
in the heat of the moment, right?

35:10.110 --> 35:11.236
But there is no way

35:11.320 --> 35:14.948
he would have the combination to the lock
unless the murder was premeditated.

35:15.032 --> 35:18.577
It's easy enough to find out
if he knows the combination. Ask him.

35:19.536 --> 35:20.996
I'm calling Aames.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.963
So Holt confessed to the murders.

35:30.464 --> 35:34.134
Take the win
before the SFPD takes the credit.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.389
It's not about the case, is it?

35:42.226 --> 35:47.105
I set the table to reveal
something ugly about Micah.

35:48.315 --> 35:50.651
But now it doesn't seem fair to air it.

35:51.693 --> 35:55.489
If Micah's living a lie, she got
all those other people living a lie too.

35:55.572 --> 35:57.658
It's time for her to come clean.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.203
Folks want the truth
from the people they look up to.

36:05.123 --> 36:08.710
Wasn't it your contention
that my client's late husband, Owen Cave,

36:08.794 --> 36:11.505
killed Chuck Buhrman
and framed his son for the murder?

36:12.881 --> 36:14.883
If you listen to my podcast,

36:14.967 --> 36:19.555
you'd know my theories evolve
as the facts of a case come to light.

36:19.638 --> 36:21.139
But your theory was wrong, wasn't it?

36:21.223 --> 36:24.101
You falsely and publicly accused
an innocent man of murder.

36:24.184 --> 36:27.855
-I drew a logical conclusion.
-It's called character assassination,

36:27.938 --> 36:31.525
which apparently you have no problem doing
even to your best friend, Micah Keith.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.694
Micah has nothing to do with this case.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.488
We'll be entering your current season
of Reconsidered into evidence

36:36.572 --> 36:38.699
to show a pattern
of damaging characterizations

36:38.782 --> 36:40.242
with no evidence to support it.

36:40.325 --> 36:43.620
My client's podcast is reported
from a first-person perspective.

36:43.704 --> 36:46.623
No different than the talking heads
on those cable news networks.

36:46.707 --> 36:48.959
Ms. Parnell shows a willful disregard

36:49.042 --> 36:51.712
for the consequences
of her disturbing allegations.

36:53.005 --> 36:55.674
We all understand
that your show has a personal slant,

36:56.800 --> 37:01.263
but can you honestly say that
you always report the story that's there

37:01.346 --> 37:03.974
and not the story you and your fans
want to believe?

37:05.434 --> 37:09.438
The only story that matters is the truth.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.858
Owen Cave had demons no one knew about.

37:13.817 --> 37:15.068
Not even his wife.

37:17.154 --> 37:22.326
In the end, there's no hiding
from the sins of our past.

37:22.409 --> 37:27.289
They come back in broken relationships,

37:28.040 --> 37:30.292
compromised integrity…

37:32.753 --> 37:34.463
emotional blind spots.

37:35.214 --> 37:36.798
And for Owen Cave…

37:39.051 --> 37:40.302
self-destruction.

37:43.388 --> 37:45.140
I am sorry for your loss…

37:47.226 --> 37:50.270
but I am not responsible for it.

37:56.860 --> 37:57.945
Alana.

37:59.821 --> 38:02.533
Can I please just have
a moment of your time?

38:09.498 --> 38:14.169
I truly am sorry
for what happened to Owen.

38:15.546 --> 38:19.132
To you. And your son, Henry.

38:27.015 --> 38:29.476
I wanted to blame you for everything.

38:30.978 --> 38:33.856
For destroying the Owen that I knew.

38:36.608 --> 38:38.193
That Owen was a great dad.

38:41.238 --> 38:45.075
It's hard to reconcile I might not
have known who he really was at all.

38:46.410 --> 38:49.037
I know you didn't mean for it to happen.

38:50.497 --> 38:51.665
But he's still gone.

39:02.634 --> 39:05.762
You were compelling in there.
We can build on that.

39:06.930 --> 39:08.348
When do we go to trial?

39:08.432 --> 39:12.769
That depends on the judge's docket.
It's gonna be nasty, but we can win this.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.148
Poppy.

39:16.899 --> 39:19.943
We did good in there.
Let's go get a drink.

39:20.027 --> 39:22.279
-Talk about the next steps.
-Thanks, Mitri.

39:22.362 --> 39:25.490
I'm… in the middle of a story.

39:26.366 --> 39:27.576
Rain check?

39:27.659 --> 39:30.454
I'll hold you to it. Good job.

39:35.751 --> 39:39.463
Micah Keith was a friend of mine.

39:40.631 --> 39:43.759
During the course
of this season of Reconsidered,

39:43.842 --> 39:48.597
I discovered things about her
that I never would have imagined.

39:49.890 --> 39:52.518
I believe it's been integral

39:52.601 --> 39:56.313
to my investigation
of Joshua Keith's murder.

39:58.440 --> 40:02.319
But I can't continue to hold my subjects
to a higher standard…

40:03.654 --> 40:04.988
than I hold myself.

40:10.077 --> 40:14.414
There was once a gifted Black girl who…

40:15.832 --> 40:18.961
nobody could see or hear.

40:20.712 --> 40:22.840
No matter how loud she yelled,

40:22.923 --> 40:27.594
she was always a girl without a voice.

40:30.138 --> 40:31.139
Her name…

40:32.724 --> 40:34.351
was Poppy Parnell.

40:38.981 --> 40:42.234
Micah and I survived
some terrible things together.

40:43.318 --> 40:45.988
That's why I trusted her longer
than I should've.

40:48.740 --> 40:53.370
She was there
for the most horrifying day of my life.

40:54.997 --> 40:57.499
I've come to terms
with what happened, but…

40:58.750 --> 41:01.461
I should've spoken my truth
a long time ago.

41:03.839 --> 41:05.549
Take you down here.

41:05.632 --> 41:08.051
I'm gonna show you. Come on.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.970
Get this damn boat.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.555
See, y'all been testing me.

41:11.638 --> 41:13.974
Sit here. Stay right here!

41:19.062 --> 41:22.649
Oh, why is this damn boat so far?

41:22.733 --> 41:25.819
A woman died because of me.

41:28.488 --> 41:30.032
I called her Miss Shirley.

41:31.867 --> 41:33.660
She was my foster mother.

41:34.620 --> 41:36.830
This damn thing is so far.

41:37.789 --> 41:41.084
Shit. I almost got it now. Come here.

41:43.295 --> 41:44.963
Help!

41:45.047 --> 41:47.090
Help! I can't swim!

41:49.718 --> 41:50.844
Poppy.

41:50.928 --> 41:53.180
Poppy, come help now!

41:53.263 --> 41:54.598
Help!

41:55.182 --> 41:56.183
I need help!

41:56.266 --> 41:58.810
The oar! I need that oar.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.105
Poppy.

42:05.234 --> 42:07.778
Poppy, help. Come help me now!

42:08.654 --> 42:09.738
Poppy!

42:14.826 --> 42:16.203
Come help!

42:16.286 --> 42:17.996
Poppy! Poppy!

42:20.707 --> 42:21.708
Help me!

42:50.237 --> 42:51.864
Where's your babysitter?

42:54.783 --> 42:57.828
It's okay, you can tell me. What's wrong?

43:01.540 --> 43:02.833
She's dead.

43:04.168 --> 43:06.086
Miss Shirley was a…

43:06.795 --> 43:08.172
a cruel woman.

43:08.881 --> 43:14.052
She abused me.
She neglected me. She hated me.

43:16.180 --> 43:17.306
A child.

43:20.434 --> 43:26.690
But she was a human being,
worthy of life, nonetheless.

43:26.773 --> 43:29.193
And I was just a little girl,

43:29.276 --> 43:32.988
too scared and traumatized to save her.

43:33.071 --> 43:35.365
I've carried that guilt my whole life.

43:36.408 --> 43:40.746
That is my truth, ugly as it is.

43:42.289 --> 43:44.958
I know that God has grace for me.

43:46.543 --> 43:51.632
You, my listeners… may be another story.

43:52.883 --> 43:57.513
But I refuse to compromise
my journalistic integrity

43:58.096 --> 43:59.515
because of my past.

44:00.933 --> 44:06.063
I know I'm putting my family
through that same crucible…

44:07.731 --> 44:09.399
by laying myself bare.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.027
But…

44:13.487 --> 44:19.576
does revealing the ugly side
of human nature have a purpose…

44:20.827 --> 44:22.329
beyond higher ratings?

44:24.540 --> 44:25.666
Beyond vengeance?

44:29.336 --> 44:33.632
When it comes to Micah Keith,
the answer is yes.

44:34.633 --> 44:38.220
She stole the life of Rose Gil.

44:38.303 --> 44:40.889
Covering that up got Joshua Keith killed.

44:40.973 --> 44:45.727
Yesterday, Holt Rollins confessed to
the murders of Joshua and Drew.

44:46.353 --> 44:50.482
He thinks his confession
will spare Micah the ordeal

44:50.566 --> 44:53.861
of having her past exposed
by my investigation.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.363
It won't.

44:57.406 --> 44:58.657
But why?

44:58.740 --> 45:02.286
Why would a man sabotage
his own murder trial

45:02.369 --> 45:04.705
and sacrifice any hope of freedom?

45:05.706 --> 45:11.128
All for a woman
he'll never be able to have.

45:12.504 --> 45:17.134
Is he being played to hide a darker truth?

45:19.595 --> 45:21.680
The killer may have come forward…

45:24.308 --> 45:27.686
but the murder has not been solved.

45:29.855 --> 45:32.065
My name is Poppy Parnell,

45:33.358 --> 45:36.945
and I'd like you to reconsider.

45:46.330 --> 45:47.706
I'm proud of you.

45:49.833 --> 45:51.168
That was worth the wait.

45:59.718 --> 46:02.262
-Hey.
-He didn't know the combination.

46:02.346 --> 46:04.556
You were right. Holt lied, Poppy.

46:04.640 --> 46:06.058
He didn't kill Josh.

46:07.559 --> 46:09.144
Then who the hell did?
