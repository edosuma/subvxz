WEBVTT

00:04.380 --> 00:05.838
Are you thinking about taking drugs?

00:05.964 --> 00:09.884
Well, think again,
because drugs are not the answer.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.261
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Oh, don't remember this ugly mug?

00:16.934 --> 00:20.937
Two years ago, I was a star.
I won nine games in a row.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.647
But by the end of August, I was gone.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.399
Cut! Cut!

00:28.904 --> 00:30.321
Not good, huh?

00:30.447 --> 00:31.989
Well, you caught the ball.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.157
Yeah.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.661
Look, I usually don't, you know,
give line readings,

00:36.787 --> 00:39.205
but try this. Here.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.957
Hollywood ain't holding its breath.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.377
Yeah, well, they're doing it wrong.
I mean, for Hank.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.379
Tell the director.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.256
I thought I'd give the marriage
a few months

00:48.382 --> 00:50.425
before I go for
the meddling-wife thing.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.512
His arm came back the day
after you hooked up. I say meddle.

00:54.638 --> 00:55.638
You okay?

00:55.764 --> 00:56.931
Just gas.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.768
Go help your man. Give me
a little room here to work it out.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.196
Take it from me, Hank Wiggen.

01:12.322 --> 01:13.906
- Like that?
- No.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.075
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.494
- Hi, Bryan.
- Hey.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.413
You boys having a little trouble
with the big speech?

01:20.539 --> 01:21.998
Yeah. You got any ideas?

01:22.124 --> 01:24.959
It's your story. Just be yourself.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.087
Drugs were there, you took them.
Simple.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.756
Why'd you get clean?

01:29.882 --> 01:31.257
'Cause I was gonna die.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.551
And, come April, 'cause you're clean,

01:33.677 --> 01:37.013
you're starting Opening Day
against the Yanks.

01:39.975 --> 01:40.975
Try it her way?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.143
Yeah.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.145
Okay. Okay.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.273
Let's start with the second part first.
That'll get him in the groove.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.900
Okay.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.818
We'll do the throwing thing first.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.987
Everybody wants to direct.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.989
Warner all right?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.532
Yeah, he's good.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.702
You just bring it, babe.
Just tell your story.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.330
Roll cameras.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.791
- Rolling. Speed.
- Sound.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.752
Come on, kid! Show them what
you're gonna give the Yankees!

02:07.878 --> 02:09.462
All right, action!

02:26.522 --> 02:27.855
Oh, God!

02:35.489 --> 02:38.491
You okay? It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

03:29.293 --> 03:33.004
He's got osteopenia. His bones are
too thin to fix the arm problem.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.841
No. Price is not a problem
if you have what I need.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.551
Young man?

03:38.677 --> 03:39.844
How did you know?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.972
Well, if he's an old man, osteopenia
would just be a fact of life.

03:43.098 --> 03:43.931
You make him comfortable,

03:44.057 --> 03:45.766
send him home,
which means you're just boring me.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.144
So he's young, which means
it's most likely caused by cancer,

03:48.270 --> 03:49.979
and you're here
because you haven't found it.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.814
Have you looked really, really hard?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.858
MRI and PET scan are both negative.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.903
Well, how old is he? Maybe
the osteopenia is just early onset.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.280
Ah, let's see.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.658
"Born 9/21/77."

04:02.784 --> 04:04.327
It's Hank Wiggen?

04:05.787 --> 04:06.913
He signed it. Sweet.

04:07.039 --> 04:07.872
Yeah.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.876
"To Jimmy Wilson,
the Cy Young of medicine."

04:12.002 --> 04:13.127
Did you ask for that?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.004
Just the "Jimmy" part.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.965
The bone's too thin to support
the kind of surgery

04:18.091 --> 04:20.217
that would let him pitch again.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.053
But if we figure out
what's causing the osteopenia,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.680
we can reverse the bone damage
then do the surgery.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.725
Beat the Yankees
and save the free world.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.941
It was a working dinner.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.069
My work, company pays.

04:39.112 --> 04:43.324
I don't know. I just feel kind of weird
after what it turned into.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.327
Well, then it stopped being work.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.373
You know,
if it'll solve your ethics problem,

04:51.166 --> 04:52.583
you can reimburse me for these.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.628
What are they, $5.57, I believe?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.261
Let me know about Friday?

05:04.388 --> 05:05.680
Yeah.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.538
None of the usual suspects.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.332
Age isn't right, in apparent perfect
health before this incident,

05:33.458 --> 05:34.875
MRI and PET scan negative for tumors.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.211
Test him again. It's gotta be cancer.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.548
Sorry I'm late.
Car broke down on the interstate.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.970
Don't believe you. CHEM-7 also shows
a poor kidney function.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.222
Now, why would a guy in his 20s
have a poor kidney function?

05:48.348 --> 05:51.267
Cancer. It first attacks the bones,
and then the kidneys.

05:51.393 --> 05:56.647
Come on, people. He was 17-7.
His ERA was 2.1.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.982
You want it to be his kidneys,

05:58.108 --> 06:01.819
because if it's his kidneys, then maybe
we can treat it, maybe we can fix it.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.030
And if it's cancer,
then he'll never pitch again.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.866
If this were a regular guy who came in
and broke his arm lifting a box,

06:06.992 --> 06:08.242
you would've packed him up
and sent him home.

06:08.368 --> 06:12.413
My God, you're right. I lost my head.
All life is equally sacred.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.832
And I promise you, the next knitting
injury that comes in here,

06:14.958 --> 06:17.084
we're on it like stink on cheese.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.962
- He weighed 175 his rookie year.
- Stop.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.882
Now he's 195
after playing a year in Japan.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.884
- Why?
- He let himself go.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.428
Steroids. The guy was a drug user.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.722
I'm sure he wouldn't have balked at
pumping up through chemicals.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.974
That'd explain the weight gain
and the kidney problems.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.810
And the bone loss.
Go ask him what he's on.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.022
When he says "nothing,"
have him pee in a cup.

06:40.942 --> 06:45.112
If your car breaks down,
you're an hour late, not two minutes.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.325
And two minutes isn't late enough to
use a clever excuse like car trouble.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.868
I was coming in early.

06:50.994 --> 06:51.994
Huh.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.705
Unprompted lies. That's a bad sign.

06:55.332 --> 06:59.043
Either a guilty conscience
or something personal's going on.

07:02.839 --> 07:06.759
See, that's all you had to do.
Just walk in, sit down, do your job.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.140
No. No, I never took them.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.936
We're gonna need a urine sample.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.188
Oh, no. You don't trust me.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.277
Baby, I'm worried about
taking this morphine.

07:25.403 --> 07:29.365
You're in pain. The doses are
monitored. It's not a slip.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.951
Besides, opiates weren't your thing.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.495
They should've been. Whoa.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.831
Mr. Wiggen? The urine sample.

07:37.749 --> 07:41.836
I want to say no, so I am. No.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.630
Trust is a big issue in early recovery.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.216
He really did gain the weight honestly.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.677
If you say so.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.847
You're not getting it.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.102
He thinks I'm an idiot.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.895
He sure does.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.530
Should we save a sample?

08:09.656 --> 08:13.576
Dr. Sports Fan can put it in Lucite
and hang it around his neck.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.037
Hey, Friday night,
can you cover for me?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.622
I think so.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.878
Oh, Friday. No, I'm sorry. I have to go
to that oncology thing, the seminar.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.088
- Oh.
- What's going on?

08:26.214 --> 08:29.925
Dinner with the drug rep.
Castine Pharmaceuticals.

08:30.051 --> 08:34.096
Arnie? Claims he has 500 lawyer jokes,
only tells one?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.432
New guy.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.102
You need cash?

08:42.856 --> 08:45.441
No, I don't have that much on me.

08:46.151 --> 08:50.571
No, no, it's not a problem. No.
I'll be over by 6:00. Okay.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.490
5:00 p.m. Dr. House checks out.

08:53.617 --> 08:54.950
It's 4:45.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.160
I was rounding up.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.247
Carol Moffatt.
Please see Dr. House in Exam 1.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.999
Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Cathy.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.375
It's Carol.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.503
Trouble with the leg?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.840
When's the wedding?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.008
This Saturday.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.177
Not much time to fit
into that pretty dress.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.095
And no time
for practical shoe shopping.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.348
You're running two miles a day further
than you should be.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.432
It hurts right...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.726
New shoes, less miles,
and ix-nay on the afternoon Cokes.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.269
You're gonna look beautiful.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.479
What's wrong with you?

09:23.605 --> 09:25.272
I can't get my contact lenses out.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.941
Out of what? They're not in your eyes.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.108
But they're red.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.819
That's because you're trying
to remove your corneas.

09:30.946 --> 09:31.987
What's wrong with you?

09:32.113 --> 09:33.697
Lately, my wife has noticed that...

09:33.823 --> 09:37.243
Yeah, yeah. Symptoms.
We're working on a personal best here.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.913
Numbness in my feet and hands,
constipation...

09:41.039 --> 09:43.958
And? Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable
talking about his private matters in...

09:44.084 --> 09:47.211
Well, neither would I if I was having
trouble controlling my pee-pee.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.838
You're a dentist.
Nitrous oxide poisoning.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.715
Which means you're either dipping into
your own supply

09:51.841 --> 09:53.467
or you got a bad valve in the office.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.053
Laughing gas rehab's probably
more expensive than the plumber.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.472
Meanwhile, get yourself some B-12.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.515
Who's left?

09:59.641 --> 10:01.016
I can't see.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.855
No, I'm just screwing with you.
It's a hangover.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.983
My English lit prof told me
he'd fail me next time

10:09.109 --> 10:10.901
if I didn't show up
with a doctor's note.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.361
Well, make friends with the dentist.

10:12.487 --> 10:16.949
He can give you a note, and maybe
a little nitrous to take the edge off.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.661
Dr. House.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.454
He tested negative for steroids.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.456
Elevated beta 2 proteins, though.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.293
Could be cancerous,
amyloidosis or lymphoma.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.961
Or steroids.
You guys got any money on you?

10:29.087 --> 10:31.213
He tested negative for steroids.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.631
I have a couple 20s on me.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.425
Fifty of them?

10:34.551 --> 10:35.843
- Foreman?
- The fat-pad biopsy

10:35.969 --> 10:38.887
and abdominal CT scan were negative
for the cancers, but...

10:39.014 --> 10:41.348
That just leaves us with steroids.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.933
He tested negative for steroids.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.936
Less money is made by biochemists
working on a cure for cancer

10:46.062 --> 10:48.188
than by their colleagues
struggling valiantly

10:48.315 --> 10:51.150
to find ways to hide steroid use.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.111
But there is one thing they can't hide.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.494
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.289
And this is the coolest day of my life.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.256
See? Steroid use shrinks the testicles.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.719
I'm clean, man.
No steroids, no nothing.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.972
Your lips say no, your prunes say yes.

11:22.098 --> 11:25.017
Hypogonadism. Isn't that a great word?

11:25.143 --> 11:27.019
Thanks. We don't get to say it
nearly enough.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.104
Start him on Lupron right away.

11:31.983 --> 11:35.194
These freaks are willing to defile
themselves for mass entertainment.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.155
For money. I feel sorry for them.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.908
He drops a clean urine,
denies using steroids

11:41.034 --> 11:43.994
then you're giving him a drug for what,
steroid abuse?

11:44.120 --> 11:47.498
No, no, it's not.
It's got calcium in it.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.166
It's very good for the bones.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.461
Basically, at a molecular level,
it's just milk.

11:53.004 --> 11:57.049
Dr. Whitman to Anesthesiology.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.968
How long do you figure before
I get a call from Cuddy?

12:00.095 --> 12:02.012
- You put him on Lupron?
- Uh-huh.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.056
And you told them it was like milk.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.224
Yes.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.310
Is there any way in which
that is not a lie?

12:09.604 --> 12:11.063
It's creamy.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.649
- But I had three reasons.
- Good ones?

12:13.775 --> 12:17.152
Well, we'll see in a minute.
I'm just making them up now.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.278
He lied to me first.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.697
Your mother did teach you
two wrongs don't make a right.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.616
If he lies to me about
not taking steroids,

12:22.742 --> 12:25.452
and I lie to him about
not treating steroids, he's cured.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.787
- Adds up for me.
- Second reason.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.789
If I told him the truth,
he wouldn't have taken the stuff.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.667
And if he told you the truth,
what would the stuff do to him?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.627
Severe respiratory problems.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.753
Third reason?

12:34.879 --> 12:37.714
I wanted to eliminate
the placebo effect.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.425
Excellent.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.219
You and your lawyer can write a paper.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.096
Which brings me to my fourth reason.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.931
I thought you said
there were only three.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.016
- I thought you'd buy one of them.
- Seriously?

12:48.143 --> 12:49.518
He's not gonna sue.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.147
Because his lawyer is a nice guy
who'll realize it's unfair to blame us

12:53.273 --> 12:55.858
for ruining this kid's
$100-million career.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.860
Good guess, but no.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.154
If the Lupron causes
respiratory problems,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.448
it means he's not on steroids.

13:02.574 --> 13:05.451
Which means there's something else
wrong with him.

13:05.577 --> 13:11.331
And the choices for that something else
are almost universally very bad.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.439
Osteopenia
messing his bones up.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.318
Hypogonadism, impaired liver function,
kidney function.

13:39.444 --> 13:44.323
And we have managed to find the only
professional athlete in the galaxy

13:44.449 --> 13:46.366
who is not on steroids.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.410
And it's not cancer.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.786
So what's killing him?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.915
Who shares my suspicions that
the Yankees were somehow involved?

13:53.041 --> 13:57.085
Shrunken testicles indicate his body's
not putting out enough testosterone.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.963
Throw out the lungs.
That was the Lupron, my fault.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.465
Don't worry. I'll send him a nice note.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.217
What about something environmental?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.636
Arsenic, mercury.
The symptoms could indicate...

14:05.762 --> 14:08.847
Pretty small environment.
Wife's fine, no one else is sick.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.058
If you throw out the kidneys,
everything else adds up.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.727
The testicles, the bones,
the impaired liver function

14:13.853 --> 14:15.979
could all be caused by a breakdown of
his adrenal glands.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.941
Addison's disease. I like it.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.859
Mainly, of course,
because the treatment is...

14:20.985 --> 14:22.361
Steroids.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.737
Enough irony for all of us.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.697
Treatment would cause him
to retain fluid.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.408
With the kidneys
almost shut down already, he'll die.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.661
So we'll get him a new kidney.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.080
Your theory is that Addison's is
causing all the symptoms

14:33.206 --> 14:35.207
except for the kidney problems.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.959
What's causing the kidney problems?

14:37.085 --> 14:39.503
Cameron, if you had to make
an ironic guess right about now...

14:39.629 --> 14:42.089
He tested negative for steroids.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.800
Agreed. He's not on steroids now.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.843
But if he was on them at any time
in the last five years,

14:46.970 --> 14:49.846
it could have caused the kidney damage.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.850
You see, kidneys don't wear watches.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.562
Sure, gall bladders do,

14:56.688 --> 14:59.523
but it doesn't matter,
'cause kidneys can't tell time.

15:00.775 --> 15:03.193
Steroid damage could take years.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.029
No steroids. How many times
does he have to tell you?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.197
I don't know.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.701
How many times did he lie about cocaine
before coming clean with the League?

15:10.827 --> 15:11.994
That's completely different.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.620
Oh, that's right, I remember.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.247
You never did come clean.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.625
The League was out to get you.
They faked the blood tests.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.419
You had to get yourself a lawyer
and everything.

15:20.545 --> 15:24.214
If Hank says he never used steroids,
that's the truth.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.382
That's too bad,

15:25.508 --> 15:29.886
because our theory is that
the kidney damage is caused by "A,"

15:30.013 --> 15:32.097
and everything else is caused by "B."

15:32.223 --> 15:34.891
The beauty of this theory is that
we can treat "A" and "B."

15:35.018 --> 15:38.604
But if you add the kidney symptoms
back into the mix,

15:38.730 --> 15:41.607
then we are looking
at another letter altogether,

15:41.733 --> 15:43.900
one that is apparently
not in the alphabet.

15:44.027 --> 15:48.697
We can't fix the bones, no more
baseball, no more breathing,

15:48.823 --> 15:50.699
no more brain function.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.910
Get another explanation.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.913
Okay. Yeah, I think I got one
in my other pants.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.042
Hold on.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.464
Five years ago. Bangor, Maine.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.052
My pitching coach had me on something.
I never knew what it was.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.347
And you never tried too hard
to find out, either.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.226
I gained 12 pounds of muscle in,
like, four weeks.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.853
I'm sorry, babe.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.027
How you doing, Doc?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.071
Good. Very good, yeah.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.745
You want me to put Hank Wiggen
on the transplant list.

16:36.871 --> 16:40.040
He needs a new kidney. I was thinking
the kidney people might have some.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.793
Well, they like to save them for people
who have...

16:42.919 --> 16:45.045
How do I put this? Kidney problems.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.964
He's a professional ball player.
Brings joy to millions.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.884
Do you really want to be known as the
hospital that sent him home to die?

16:51.010 --> 16:54.763
That's a great idea. We could be
the hospital that killed two people,

16:54.889 --> 16:58.517
the guy who deserved the kidney, and
the ball player we bumped up the list

16:58.643 --> 17:00.185
when we weren't even sure
what was wrong with him.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.895
Everything else is related
to the Addison's.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.439
The test for Addison's
was inconclusive.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.275
The test for Addison's
is always inconclusive.

17:07.402 --> 17:10.445
Why do we do it at all?
We should just ask you.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.828
You're not putting him on the list.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.622
Your powers of deduction
are breathtaking.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.083
You take a perverse pleasure
in turning me down.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.960
What I live for.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.714
Once in a while, though,
try to ruin my day.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.633
Ask me something I can say "yes" to.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.611
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.
I didn't know you were busy.

17:51.738 --> 17:52.946
Want me to come back?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.406
Is he on the list?

17:54.532 --> 17:55.741
No.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.242
Then I'm giving him one of mine.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.618
Okay.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.162
You're not gonna tell me
it's a bad idea?

18:00.288 --> 18:03.081
Why give a kidney to someone
who might not be able to use it?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.750
Not my area.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.586
That is, however, my chair.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.422
When do we do it?

18:10.548 --> 18:12.382
Very noble gesture.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.553
My favorite kind. Dramatic,
yet completely empty.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.638
The chances of nonidentical twins
being a...

18:18.765 --> 18:19.723
You live alone?

18:19.849 --> 18:20.974
You writing a book?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.810
I made it a question
just 'cause it's more polite.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.021
You've got a big "keep out" sign
stapled on your forehead.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.982
That explains it.
I told them to put it on my door.

18:29.108 --> 18:34.321
Even if real human contact is something
you don't have or even want or need,

18:34.447 --> 18:36.740
you should at least be able to see it
in other people.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.117
Yeah. Right. True love.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.411
That's just how we match organs
these days.

18:41.537 --> 18:46.041
There's a couple in France, high school
sweethearts, they're trading brains.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.919
We're a match. Run your tests.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.102
Hey. Did the lab call? Is she a match?

19:06.229 --> 19:07.270
Haven't heard yet.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.774
You got a text message, though.
"Friday night." Very cryptic.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.611
Gee, thanks for checking.
Can you cover for me?

19:14.737 --> 19:16.613
Oncology seminar. Right.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.658
Friday night the same thing
as the car trouble?

19:19.784 --> 19:21.076
I had car trouble.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.329
House says you were lying.
I believe him.

19:24.455 --> 19:27.874
What's that? You got a little wet
smudge at the end of your nose.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.710
Hey, I like the guy. He says what
he wants, does what he wants.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.879
He won't talk to anyone
unless he can jerk them around.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.924
Or needs 1,000 bucks.
What is with that?

19:36.884 --> 19:38.134
I scored.

19:40.596 --> 19:44.224
It's a brave new world, Doc,
and we are the cutting edge.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.856
You are looking at
two all-access passes

19:50.982 --> 19:52.816
to paradise itself.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.527
How much?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.113
True cost? No man can say.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.031
Could that man's accountant say?

20:00.157 --> 20:02.701
One thousand dollars.
Friday night.

20:02.827 --> 20:06.830
The biggest official monster truck jam
in the history of New Jersey.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.959
Okay, please tell me
you didn't just say Friday night.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.836
Whatever you've got, you cancel.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.713
I can't do it.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.090
Listen, they only give
these tickets to owners.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.925
Anytime we want to be
in the middle of the track,

20:19.051 --> 20:20.218
we're in the middle of the track.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.763
These tickets are so good,
we have to sign a release.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.017
I mean it. We do this, we could die.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.353
I've got the oncology thing.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.814
The rectal cancer lecture,
they booked me a year ago.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.649
I can't get out.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.484
There's no way out.

20:37.612 --> 20:41.197
Fine. I'll ask one of my other friends.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.871
What? You're saying
I've only got one friend?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.458
And who?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.836
Kevin in Bookkeeping.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.006
Okay, well, first of all,
his name's Carl.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.758
I call him Kevin.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.677
It's his secret-friendship-club name.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.805
- It's hookers.
- Oh, my God!

21:05.932 --> 21:07.974
Multiple hookers.
I mean, House is House, right?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.393
He's gotta have it his way.
Four or five women.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.853
This isn't even funny.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.772
What? You don't think he has sex?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.106
No, of course he...

21:15.232 --> 21:17.484
He doesn't have sex, he makes love.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.486
I didn't say that.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.657
It's the lab.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.241
Dr. Foreman.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.995
Respiratory Therapy,
call 4502.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.207
Respiratory Therapy, pick up 4502.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.793
If you have the results,
I'd like you to talk to both of us.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.128
If you don't, I'm late for a meeting.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.674
Believe me. I'd much rather be
with your better half.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
And by better half,

21:41.926 --> 21:44.719
of course, I mean the one who struck
out Sammy Sosa on three pitches

21:44.845 --> 21:46.638
and talks a lot less.

21:47.181 --> 21:50.850
But I thought I would talk to you
first, and alone.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.687
I got your results back from the lab.

21:54.397 --> 21:55.981
You do match.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.109
I do?

22:04.490 --> 22:06.282
You're also pregnant.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.209
You can't be a donor.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.797
Not in your current condition.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.980
Excuse me.
I have to go talk to my husband.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.629
Heart looks good.
We can schedule the transplant.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.423
No transplant.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.050
Lola's not gonna have an abortion.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.637
Actually, your wife just told me that
she was making an appointment.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.265
I don't care what she said.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.350
I think you two need
to discuss this further.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.812
We've been trying to get pregnant
almost since we met.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.774
Well, it's your wife's decision
whether or not...

23:20.900 --> 23:24.569
She wants to trade a child
for a kidney. That's murder.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.780
I'm not gonna let her do that.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.743
Foreman says we've got a problem
about the transplant.

23:31.869 --> 23:36.623
If she terminates the pregnancy, he's
not gonna let himself die on principle.

23:37.792 --> 23:40.794
Would you give up a baby
for someone you love?

23:41.504 --> 23:44.089
Please tell me I don't have to decide.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.343
It depends. How long would they live?

23:48.469 --> 23:50.929
This is a pragmatic question for you?

23:51.055 --> 23:52.931
Fifty years, no problem.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.850
Six months, I say let him die.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.935
I've actually given this
a lot of thought.

23:57.061 --> 24:01.356
My personal tipping point is seven
years, eight months and 14 days.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.774
I couldn't do it.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.067
You found religion?

24:04.193 --> 24:06.319
Do you have to be religious
to believe a fetus is a life?

24:06.445 --> 24:08.822
There seems to be a correlation.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.871
I'm...

24:20.209 --> 24:22.335
Do you like monster trucks?

24:23.462 --> 24:24.754
I don't know what they are.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.089
Right.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.177
I've got two tickets. Friday night.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.680
Are you asking me to go with you?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.807
Sure. Sounds good.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.309
Like a date?

24:39.728 --> 24:42.856
Exactly. Except for the date part.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.777
Forget it.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.656
No, I was gonna go to
the oncology dinner.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.784
Of course.
You have to hear Wilson's lecture.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.872
No. I just found out he canceled,
like, two weeks ago.

25:05.254 --> 25:08.173
So, what do I wear?

25:10.885 --> 25:12.010
Still with us, Hank?

25:12.136 --> 25:13.136
Yeah. I'm here.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.096
My chest feels funny.

25:15.890 --> 25:18.266
Tachycardia.
Your heart's beating too fast.

25:18.392 --> 25:22.145
We're sorting it out.
But you stay with us, all right?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.438
Keep talking to us, Hank!

25:23.564 --> 25:24.564
Where's Lola?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.649
Ten units of insulin subQ,
an IV push D50.

25:26.775 --> 25:27.692
Base is still dropping.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.152
Why is his potassium up?

25:29.278 --> 25:30.528
Damned if I know.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.614
Kayexalate, too. We gotta suck
that potassium out of him.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.823
We gotta get his heart rate down.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.074
We need a crash cart!

25:35.201 --> 25:36.284
You got it.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.454
It's definitely not Addison's.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.331
It's not steroids, either.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.958
Set.
Help in here, please!

25:44.752 --> 25:48.796
His heart rate is 130 and rising like
a Randy Johnson line drive.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.132
"A" for effort.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.675
There's no point in doing
the transplant.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.135
Even if he was stable enough,

25:54.261 --> 25:57.222
it's obvious that we have no idea
what's wrong with him.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.808
First it's too high,
now it's too low?

26:02.978 --> 26:05.897
His heart's
not responding to the atropine.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.899
Heart rate's down to 40.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.025
I thought it was up.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.653
Now it's down.
Last time, he went out at 35.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.779
What's wrong?

26:12.905 --> 26:14.113
I have no idea.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.703
Hit him with the atropine
before he gets to 35 again.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.039
We've already given him
three milliliters.

26:23.165 --> 26:25.458
Apparently that's not enough.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.336
We can't stabilize
his heart rate.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.088
What did you do to him?
Kayexalate.

26:30.214 --> 26:33.466
His pulse was through the roof.
So was his potassium.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.759
It wouldn't do this.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.052
Something did.

26:40.474 --> 26:43.434
Call me when he's stable. Or dead.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.488
I remember the first time.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.826
You weren't even supposed
to be pitching that day.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.120
I'd flown all the way to Tokyo
to watch this kid,

27:02.246 --> 27:06.332
and he gets tossed for arguing a call
in the first inning.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.379
Your pitches. Perfect.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.009
Ball seemed to go faster than your arm.

27:16.135 --> 27:20.638
It was like the rules didn't apply,
like physics couldn't slow you down.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.350
Hot damn, it was beautiful.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.315
Hey, Warner.

27:31.358 --> 27:34.152
Hey, kid. How you feeling?

27:34.862 --> 27:35.987
I hurt.

27:36.947 --> 27:39.949
My arm, my head, everywhere.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.870
They must've dialed down the morphine.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.831
That's just wrong, man. You're in pain.

27:47.875 --> 27:51.044
Hey, I got something for you.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.631
No.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.718
A doc in St. Louis gave them to me
for migraine.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.845
I'm an addict. I can't take that.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.722
Even Lola was okay with the morphine.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.558
This stuff's just a little stronger.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.851
Come on.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.318
I'll just try one, Warner.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.614
Dr. Mulvaney,
please call extension 6134.

28:20.324 --> 28:23.618
Dr. Mulvaney,
please call extension 6134.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.828
Three more symptoms.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.582
Heart rate up. Heart rate down.
Now he's hallucinating.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.126
You gotta promise not to tell Lola.

28:32.795 --> 28:33.753
Okay, coach?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.713
He's not just dreaming?

28:35.839 --> 28:38.466
No REM. He's actually awake.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.259
Drugs?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.761
Not psychedelics.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.430
Not with the heart symptoms.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.016
Well, hallucinations
would point to digitalis.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.018
It would also mess up his heart.

28:49.937 --> 28:53.606
But he's not on it.
And why would he take it?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.234
Yeah.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.820
Pithy analysis.

28:58.946 --> 29:02.031
I can see why they asked you
to speak at the cancer dinner.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.283
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.619
I'm sorry about the monster trucks.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.789
No, I think it's great.
You're giving back.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.919
Only thing is,

29:17.339 --> 29:18.923
digitalis,

29:20.259 --> 29:22.969
it would only explain
the later symptoms,

29:23.095 --> 29:24.929
not the original ones.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.817
Sure, you know,
it's got a lot of movement.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.694
Problem is,
everybody sees the movement.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.406
You're throwing your curveball
like you're throwing a curveball.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.450
Deception. That's the...

29:47.786 --> 29:48.870
Same motion.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.414
Less movement,
but it won't come back at you.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.417
All right, outfielders, move in!
Right there!

29:57.921 --> 29:59.714
How'd you get in here?

29:59.840 --> 30:03.259
Spoke Spanish. Told them I was
the new shortstop from the Dominican.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.719
How's Hank doing?

30:04.845 --> 30:05.928
Lousy.

30:07.890 --> 30:12.268
Around your fingernails, that swelling,
it's called clubbing.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.189
Hippocrates noticed that a lot of
his friends who also had that

30:16.315 --> 30:18.691
tended to frequently grab their chests
and die.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.986
Yeah, I got a heart condition.
What's wrong with Hank?

30:22.112 --> 30:23.446
What do you take for it?

30:23.572 --> 30:24.780
Digitalis.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.908
Got them with you?

30:29.536 --> 30:30.828
That's weird.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.331
I just filled this prescription
a couple days ago.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.583
There's another bottle here.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.502
Don't bother.

30:37.628 --> 30:39.879
Hank Wiggen stole your pills.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.798
He tried to kill himself.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.525
So what happened?

31:02.945 --> 31:05.821
He left the bottle open
while he went to get some water?

31:05.948 --> 31:08.449
Next time, just take the whole bottle.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.951
Hey, man, you got no right.

31:10.077 --> 31:12.870
See, people remember
how many they've got.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.457
Date's right on the label,
number of pills,

31:16.583 --> 31:17.833
a regular person can do the math.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.335
But a junkie doesn't have to,

31:19.461 --> 31:22.797
because how many pills he's got left,
that's all he's thinking about.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.882
Big insurance policy?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.928
This isn't about the money.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.721
Not for you, no.

31:30.847 --> 31:34.976
Most reputable stores won't cash
your checks after you're dead.

31:35.102 --> 31:38.854
But for Lola, well, girls like that,
they're all about the money.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.982
Don't you say that.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.192
She already saved my life.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.653
I was dead in Japan,
and she brought me back.

31:45.779 --> 31:49.073
Everything since then, that's gravy.
That's more than I deserve.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.492
- You owe her?
- Everything.

31:51.910 --> 31:56.622
So, the attempted suicide,
the scaring her to death, what is that?

31:56.748 --> 31:58.916
That's gratitude? Love?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.127
Yeah, I get that.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.715
Well, take out what
you did to yourself yesterday.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.551
We're back to the kidneys
and the bones.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.430
I'm scheduling the transplant.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.812
Never visit a patient.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.647
I want that baby!

32:21.773 --> 32:24.442
Even if I'm gone,
that's a piece of me and Lola,

32:24.568 --> 32:27.111
breathing, walking around town,

32:27.863 --> 32:29.447
going to baseball games.

32:31.617 --> 32:35.870
If there's any more transplant talk
from you, or Lola, or anybody else,

32:35.996 --> 32:38.289
I won't screw it up this time.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.375
I'll take myself out for good.

32:44.171 --> 32:46.631
I'll start treating the Addison's,

32:46.757 --> 32:49.175
which will most likely destroy
what's left of your kidneys.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.844
Fine. Start the treatment.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.727
Hey.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.358
Hank Wiggen peed on me.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.652
What do you think
these pants are worth on eBay?

33:07.778 --> 33:09.904
I've got some big-boy diapers
in my office.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.447
The rep hands them out like candy.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.823
Is it that bad?

33:12.949 --> 33:14.950
No, not if you like the smell of urine.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.702
Of course, why should I trust someone

33:16.828 --> 33:19.997
who lies about
what he's doing Friday night?

33:21.166 --> 33:23.584
Question is,
what are you really doing Friday night?

33:23.710 --> 33:27.713
Or more to the point, what could
possibly be better than monster trucks?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.924
Or are we breaking up?

33:47.150 --> 33:50.027
Stacy's coming into town this weekend.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.029
We're having dinner.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.281
Just catching up.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.160
I definitely had pants here.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.955
Wait a second.
Is that Stacy the stripper?

34:01.081 --> 34:02.957
I heard she's playing Atlantic City.

34:03.083 --> 34:07.086
No, Stacy the constitutional lawyer.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.257
You thought
I couldn't handle this news.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.345
You talk to her a lot?

34:16.972 --> 34:19.890
No, it's been a long time.

34:22.853 --> 34:24.520
If you don't want me to see her...

34:24.646 --> 34:27.440
What is this, eighth grade? I'm fine.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.400
It's fine if you're upset.

34:29.526 --> 34:30.985
No, it's...

34:32.988 --> 34:34.947
I have no right to be upset.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.491
You two were friends.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.121
You should see her.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.874
Say hi for me.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.293
So, you're okay?

34:47.419 --> 34:51.839
I'm not the cancer doctor
who's lying about a cancer dinner.

34:51.965 --> 34:57.470
I'm not the one betraying all those
poor little bald-headed, dying kids.

35:00.474 --> 35:03.476
I'm gonna go get some pants. I stink.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.694
You're treating him for Addison's
and you don't think it's gonna work?

35:13.820 --> 35:15.029
He tried to kill himself.

35:15.155 --> 35:16.280
I know.

35:16.990 --> 35:21.786
He's confused. We can have another
baby. I can make him understand that.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.078
I'm having an abortion. We do the...

35:23.205 --> 35:24.205
No.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.415
I can make decisions about my body.

35:26.541 --> 35:30.503
And he can make decisions about his.
He doesn't want your kidney.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.882
So, he'll die?

35:37.928 --> 35:39.053
Probably.

35:57.030 --> 36:00.616
If you keep that appointment,
he'll also probably die.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.373
Keep the baby.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.721
Are you just being polite?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.643
'Cause my pants are...

36:27.769 --> 36:29.478
Oh, they're all wet.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.652
You can't smell that?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.824
You think she'll abort anyway,
try to force his hand?

36:41.950 --> 36:44.618
No, she's not gonna risk losing him.

36:47.289 --> 36:48.914
That's funny?

36:49.666 --> 36:53.460
No, the monster trucks.
House asking you, that's...

36:53.587 --> 36:54.587
That's funny.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.756
I was the first person he ran into.
He just asked me.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.884
Yeah, like a date.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.928
Exactly. Except for the date part.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.686
If the patient decides to go
the dialysis route,

37:10.812 --> 37:13.647
we've got some product
you should check out.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.400
Hey, Dr. Foreman.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.695
Courtesy of the generous Sharon and the
good folks at Castine Pharmaceuticals.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.865
I was just telling the guys about
the Bermuda conference in April.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.743
Three days of sun and scuba,
and one hour of lecture.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.412
Oh, God,
do we have to go to the lecture?

37:28.538 --> 37:30.623
So, you're the new Arnie.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.543
Dr. House. It's good to see you.

37:34.669 --> 37:37.796
Would you get me a coffee?
Black, no sugar.

37:45.889 --> 37:47.598
Okay, so who is it?

37:48.516 --> 37:51.060
Come on.
She's sleeping with one of you.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.771
Oh, God, please tell me it's you.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.272
She buys lunches. She doesn't...

37:55.398 --> 37:58.859
Don't worry. You're not gay.
You're adventurous.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.861
You think
she's gonna prostitute herself?

38:00.987 --> 38:02.821
The three of us are
that important to her?

38:02.948 --> 38:04.823
I'm afraid not, no.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.993
The groupies sleep with the roadies
in order to get to Mick.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.703
And you're Mick?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.830
That was the metaphor I was making,
yes.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.791
Why are you here?

38:15.835 --> 38:17.544
Damn, it's you.

38:20.924 --> 38:24.468
It's not Addison's. New symptom.
Inability to smell.

38:24.594 --> 38:25.803
I was just in Hank's room.

38:25.929 --> 38:29.264
He said it smelled like the men's room
at Veterans Stadium. He was right.

38:29.391 --> 38:32.017
We rejected environmental causes
because the wife was healthy.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.854
Well, she's not. Last six months,
she can't smell a thing.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.190
If you think of them
as one single patient,

38:38.692 --> 38:40.859
you add her symptoms to his...

38:41.319 --> 38:42.987
Cadmium poisoning.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.991
It explains everything. Even why they
had so much trouble getting pregnant.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.201
How could they have gotten exposed to
that much cadmium?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.162
Unless they were eating steel
and batteries for breakfast.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.956
So, where else is cadmium?

38:54.082 --> 38:56.250
Some foods, polluted groundwater.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.168
We should check their home.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.005
I think I know how it happened.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.132
I'm gonna need another urine sample.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.967
- What for?
- Sure.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.301
Whatever you want.

39:06.428 --> 39:09.680
Why wouldn't you give it to me before,
but now it's no problem?

39:09.806 --> 39:11.390
I'm dying, right?

39:11.516 --> 39:13.475
So you've got nothing
to lose this time.

39:14.853 --> 39:18.522
Begs the question,
what were you worried about last time?

39:19.816 --> 39:20.649
The funny thing is,

39:20.775 --> 39:23.736
when we tested you before,
we were just looking for steroids.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.363
What should we look for now, Hank?

39:26.906 --> 39:30.034
Hank, what's the story?

39:31.536 --> 39:35.039
A little weed every now and then
when no one was looking?

39:39.669 --> 39:41.086
I don't believe this.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.254
We quit.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.547
You did.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.300
If you'd kept going, you wouldn't have
just lost your sense of smell.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.302
I quit the hard stuff.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.971
I just needed to relax.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.766
Based on the symptoms,
you're a lot more than a social user.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.310
So you've been lying to me
all this time?

39:56.436 --> 39:57.436
I'm sorry.

39:57.562 --> 40:01.148
There must have been cadmium in the
soil where the marijuana was grown.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.109
Some people get bone loss,
kidney failure,

40:04.402 --> 40:06.695
some people's testes shrink,

40:06.821 --> 40:09.531
and some people lose
their sense of smell.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.909
We'll start treatment right away.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.787
You should be fine by Opening Day.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.872
Baseball's in the summer, right?

40:16.998 --> 40:19.583
It didn't hurt the baby, did it?
The cadmium?

40:19.709 --> 40:22.252
If you've been clean,
the baby should be fine.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.629
Okay.

40:25.673 --> 40:30.094
Please. I'll stop everything.
I'll go to meetings every day.

40:34.974 --> 40:36.141
Lola.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.520
Twice a day.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.773
How's the ballplayer doing?

40:42.899 --> 40:43.899
Much better.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.567
Too bad about his career.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.069
What do you mean?

40:47.195 --> 40:49.196
Major League Baseball's collective
bargaining agreement

40:49.322 --> 40:51.865
requires medical reports
on all treatment.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.159
Given Hank's history,
he's not likely to get much leniency.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.412
Why should they care
that he's being treated for Addison's?

40:57.539 --> 40:59.123
You're not treating him for Addison's.

40:59.249 --> 41:00.791
My report says I am.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.335
You're lying on the report?

41:03.461 --> 41:05.504
Well, everybody does stupid things.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.882
It shouldn't cost them everything
they want in life.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.718
No, it shouldn't, but it usually does.

41:12.720 --> 41:16.974
On the other hand, if it means someone
can actually beat the Yankees...

41:20.854 --> 41:24.857
So what about House? Is there any way
we can get him down there?

41:26.693 --> 41:28.986
You really want to talk about work?

41:30.864 --> 41:33.365
No. Not at all.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.805
That was amazing!

41:56.931 --> 41:59.975
I'm telling you.
Grave Digger never disappoints.

42:06.691 --> 42:08.567
You ever been married?

42:09.736 --> 42:13.697
Well, now, let's not ruin a lovely
night out by getting personal.

42:15.158 --> 42:17.659
I lived with someone for a while.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.371
You gonna finish that?

42:24.959 --> 42:26.293
Okay. Okay.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.088
I'll race you to the car.
