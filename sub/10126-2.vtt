YOU HIT A CERTAIN AGE,

00:54.033 --> 00:56.967
YOU'RE AFRAID TO WAKE UP

02:22.133 --> 02:25.500

02:25.500 --> 02:26.600
HI, CORY.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.500

02:29.500 --> 02:30.600

TALKING ABOUT?

02:30.600 --> 02:33.300

02:38.233 --> 02:40.500
OF COURSE NOT.
I'M GOING OUT WITH CORY.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.700
OH. YOU'RE
STILL WITH HIM?

02:41.700 --> 02:43.767
I FIGURED YOU'D HAVE
DUMPED HIM OVER THE SUMMER.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.133
WOULD YOU PLEASE LEAVE?

02:45.133 --> 02:49.200
YEAH, BUT IF YOU DO
DECIDE TO DUMP HIM,
HERE'S MY CARD.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.500
"LOCKER NUMBER 168."

02:52.500 --> 02:54.967
HA. THAT'S
A NICE LOCKER.

02:54.967 --> 02:59.200
LOOK, CORY, IT'S JUST
SOME GUY ASKING ME OUT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.500
WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL
TO YOU

03:00.500 --> 03:01.800
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ASKEE.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.000
AND WHY ARE YOU
THE ASKEE?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.734
YOU'RE ALWAYS THE ASKEE
BECAUSE YOU ARE GORGEOUS.

03:05.734 --> 03:06.800
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH,

03:06.800 --> 03:08.100
BUT GIVE ME
SOME CREDIT.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.500
I KNOW GUYS GO OUT
WITH GIRLS BECAUSE
OF HOW THEY LOOK.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.567
BUT YOU GO OUT WITH ME
BECAUSE OF WHO I AM INSIDE.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.100
THE ONLY REASON YOU THINK
I'M GOOD-LOOKING

03:18.100 --> 03:20.100
IS BECAUSE
YOU CARE ABOUT ME.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.400
THAT WAS
ONE TOO MANY.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.734
IT WOULDN'T MATTER
WHAT I LOOKED LIKE. YOU'D
STILL THINK I WAS PRETTY.

03:25.734 --> 03:27.900
YEAH, BUT, TOPANGA,
I MEAN, THIS IS EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.400
YOU DON'T HAVE A NOSE
THAT TAKES UP
HALF YOUR FACE

03:30.400 --> 03:32.200
AND HAIR
LIKE A BRILLO PAD.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.934
COME HERE.

03:33.934 --> 03:35.300
WHAT? YA SAW SUDS?

03:35.300 --> 03:40.367
FIRST OF ALL,
I LOVE YOUR FACE,
AND I LOVE YOUR HAIR,

03:40.367 --> 03:41.400
BUT MOST OF ALL,

03:41.400 --> 03:43.834
I LOVE YOU
BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE.

03:43.834 --> 03:46.900
AND I HOPE YOU LOVE ME
BECAUSE OF WHO I AM

03:46.900 --> 03:49.500
AND NOT BECAUSE
OF MY FACE AND HAIR.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.233
CORY.

03:51.233 --> 03:53.400
TOPANGA, IF I LOOKED IN
THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING

03:53.400 --> 03:56.233
AND SAW WHAT YOU SEE,
I'D FEEL REAL GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF, TOO.

03:56.233 --> 03:57.700
OH, SO YOU THINK
THAT'S IT?

03:57.700 --> 04:00.200
YOU THINK WHAT GIVES ME
ALL MY CONFIDENCE
IS MY FACE AND HAIR.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.467
AND THE FACT
THAT THEY'RE PERFECT,

04:01.467 --> 04:03.500
YEAH, I THINK THAT
PUTS A LITTLE SPRING
IN YOUR STEP.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.100
OH, YEAH?

04:05.100 --> 04:07.000
WELL, HERE'S
WHAT I THINK.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.033
WORDS, TOPANGA.
USE YOUR WORDS.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
WELL?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.500
AM I ANY DIFFERENT NOW?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.467
WELL, SOMEWHAT
LESS PREDICTABLE,

04:19.467 --> 04:20.600
BUT, NO,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.900
I'D LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT
YOU LOOKED LIKE.

04:22.900 --> 04:26.834
GOOD. GLAD YOU
LEARNED SOMETHING.

04:32.734 --> 04:34.000
SHE'S GONNA SCREAM NOW.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.467
AAH!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.734
IT'S OK.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE HAIR.

04:39.734 --> 04:40.967
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHO I AM.

04:40.967 --> 04:42.200
I AM STILL
TOPANGA LAWRENCE,

04:42.200 --> 04:45.900
AND NOBODY WHO CARES ABOUT
ME WILL EVEN NOTICE, RIGHT?

04:45.900 --> 04:47.367
MR. MATTHEWS.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.400
MR. HUNTER.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.400
OOH.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.400
WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED TO YOU?

04:51.400 --> 04:52.467
MR. FEENY,
I'VE CUT MY HAIR

04:52.467 --> 04:53.734
IN AN ATTEMPT
TO SHOW CORY

04:53.734 --> 04:57.133
THAT PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
IS SECONDARY
TO INNER BEAUTY.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.700
AHA. WELL, IN THAT CASE,
MISS LAWRENCE,

05:00.700 --> 05:04.800
I APPLAUD
YOUR ATTEMPT AT TEACHING
A VERY VALUABLE LESSON

05:04.800 --> 05:07.500
DURING THESE
EXTREMELY VULNERABLE...

05:07.500 --> 05:08.500
TEENAGE YEARS.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.467
YOU THINK I'M UGLY!

05:14.033 --> 05:16.800
NICE GOING,
FEENY.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.133
MAN COMING IN.
MAN COMING IN.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.767
I'M NOT LOOKING. I'M
JUST HERE ON BUSINESS.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.033
NOW I'M TAKING
MY ARM DOWN.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.567
YOU'LL PROBABLY
WANT TO SCATTER.

05:26.567 --> 05:28.700
GO AHEAD.
SCREAM. SCATTER.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.834
MAKE A BIG SCENE.

05:32.133 --> 05:34.667
SEE, 'CAUSE I'M A BOY.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.000
HEY, HOW COME YOU GUYS
GET A COUCH?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
SOMETIMES WE NEED
TO LIE DOWN.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.767
YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE GUYS
ARE DIFFERENT.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.500
WE'RE IN, WE'RE OUT.
WE DON'T LIKE TO LINGER.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.233
LOOK, CORY, I'M HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW,

05:47.233 --> 05:49.967
AND I'D REALLY
LIKE TO BE ALONE.

05:49.967 --> 05:52.200
WELL, I'LL...

05:52.200 --> 05:54.367
BE ALONE WITH YOU.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.967
LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

06:01.967 --> 06:02.967
I MEAN...

06:02.967 --> 06:05.133
LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR.

06:05.133 --> 06:06.367
YOU'RE
STILL BEAUTIFUL.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.734
I CAN'T LOOK
IN THE MIRROR.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.100
TOPANGA,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.300
IT DOESN'T
MATTER TO ME
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.567
IT ONLY MATTERS
TO ME WHO YOU ARE.

06:13.567 --> 06:15.100
SEE, THAT'S
MY PROBLEM, CORY.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.934
I THOUGHT I WAS
SOMEONE WHO THOUGHT THAT
APPEARANCE DIDN'T MATTER,

06:18.934 --> 06:20.900
BUT THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE
I WAS COMFORTABLE

06:20.900 --> 06:23.300
WITH MY APPEARANCE
ALL THIS TIME.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.667
BUT NOW I'M NOT.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.800
HOW SHALLOW CAN I BE?

06:26.800 --> 06:28.834
YOU ARE NOT SHALLOW.

06:28.834 --> 06:29.834
YOU'RE DEEP.

06:29.834 --> 06:31.100
YOU'RE THE DEEPEST,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.467
MOST THOUGHTFUL,
PROFOUND PERSON
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

06:33.467 --> 06:34.800
HOW'S MY HAIR LOOK?

06:34.800 --> 06:38.500
WELL, THAT'S NOT ONE
OF YOUR STRONG POINTS
ANYMORE.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.200
YOU GOTTA LET THAT GO.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.600
LOOK, HOW LONG
DID IT TAKE YOU

06:45.600 --> 06:47.133
TO GROW YOUR HAIR
THAT LONG?

06:47.133 --> 06:48.467
SIX OR SEVEN YEARS.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.700
THAT'S PERFECT

06:50.700 --> 06:52.000
BECAUSE IN SIX
OR SEVEN YEARS,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.300
YOU'LL GROW
YOUR HAIR BACK,

06:53.300 --> 06:55.500
I'LL BE OUT
OF MY GOOSEY-GOOSEY STAGE.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.800
DON'T YOU SEE?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.567
IT MAKES US EVEN CLOSER
AS A COUPLE

06:58.567 --> 07:01.567
BECAUSE NOW
WE ARE IN PERFECT SYNC.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.133
SEE, CORY.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.967
THAT'S WHY
I LOVE YOU.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.100
THANKS.
TODAY AFTER SCHOOL,

07:07.100 --> 07:08.367
I'LL GO DOWN TO
THE BEAUTY PARLOR

07:08.367 --> 07:09.500
AND GET THIS
ALL EVENED OUT.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.100
GREAT IDEA.

07:19.934 --> 07:21.200
SO, HOW'D IT GO?

07:21.200 --> 07:23.900
TOPANGA'S GOING
TO THE BEAUTY PARLOR
AFTER SCHOOL.

07:23.900 --> 07:24.900
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.834
HUH. SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO NOW?

07:27.834 --> 07:29.033
I DON'T KNOW.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.934
WANNA SIT
ON THE COUCH?

07:30.934 --> 07:32.600
YEAH.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.667
AHH.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.400
HA HA.
YOU SOLVED THAT CRIME,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.500
YOU FAT, FAT MAN.

07:51.967 --> 07:53.967
ERIC, IT'S 4:00.

07:53.967 --> 07:56.467
YOU WERE SITTING THERE
WHEN I LEFT THIS MORNING.

07:56.467 --> 07:59.000
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO LOOK FOR A JOB.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.800
THINK I FOUND ONE, MOM.
CHECK IT OUT.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.000
ALL DAY LONG, I'VE BEEN
WATCHING CRIMES ON TV

08:03.000 --> 08:05.734
SOLVED BY OLD GUYS,
BY FAT GUYS,

08:05.734 --> 08:07.400
BY GUYS WITH
WRINKLED RAINCOATS.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.900
SO, NATURALLY,
IT OCCURS TO ME,

08:08.900 --> 08:14.000
WHAT THIS WORLD NEEDS
IS "ERIC MATTHEWS,
GOOD-LOOKING DETECTIVE."

08:14.000 --> 08:16.967
I'M GONNA DO
SO MUCH HOMEWORK.

08:16.967 --> 08:19.133
CHECK IT OUT.
I ALREADY THOUGHT
OF A THEME SONG.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.867
âª WHEN A CRIME
BREAKS OUT âª

08:20.867 --> 08:22.400
âª ALL THE CUTE GIRLS
SHOUT âª

08:22.400 --> 08:25.000
âª GET THE
GOOD-LOOKIN' GUY âª

08:25.000 --> 08:26.734
âª WHEN THERE'S
A CRIME OUT THERE âª

08:26.734 --> 08:28.133
âª HE'S GONNA
COMB HIS HAIR âª

08:28.133 --> 08:32.367
âª 'CAUSE HE'S THE
GOOD-LOOKIN' GUY âª

08:32.367 --> 08:34.300
BOOK HIM,
GOOD-LOOKIN'.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.033
HONEY,
I'M SCARED FOR YOU.

08:36.033 --> 08:39.200
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.233
TO DO WHAT?

08:40.233 --> 08:41.567
I MEAN, MOM,

08:41.567 --> 08:43.400
LET'S SAY I DO
FIND ONE OF THESE
SO-CALLED JOBS.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.734
I MEAN, WITH
NOTHING BETTER THAN
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA,

08:45.734 --> 08:47.600
THE BEST I CAN ASK FOR
IS MINIMUM WAGE.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.300
AND WHAT THEY
TAKE OUT FOR TAXES?

08:49.300 --> 08:52.033
HONESTLY THINK I CAN DO
BETTER SOLVING CRIMES.

08:52.033 --> 08:53.400
âª WHEN A CRIME
BREAKS OUT-- âª

08:53.400 --> 08:58.600
STOP. SWEETHEART,
YOU CANNOT JUST MOPE
AROUND THE HOUSE.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.800
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OUT ON A DATE?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.300
YOU USED TO DATE
ALL THE TIME.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.300
I KNOW,
BUT ALL THE GIRLS
I USED TO DATE

09:04.300 --> 09:05.467
HAVE GONE OFF
TO COLLEGE.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.667
OH, I'M SURE THERE'S
PLENTY OF NICE GIRLS

09:07.667 --> 09:08.667
RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.300
TOWNIES? YOU WANT ME
TO DATE A TOWNIE?

09:11.300 --> 09:12.800
OH, THAT IS GREAT, MOM.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.900
I CAN SEE THEM
RIGHT NOW

09:13.900 --> 09:16.233
SITTING ON THEIR COUCH
IN THEIR RATTY BATHROBE,

09:16.233 --> 09:19.600
WATCHING DAYTIME TV,
EATING BONBONS.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.767
THESE ARE
COCOA PUFFS.

09:24.934 --> 09:27.367
AND I'M A DETECTIVE.

09:31.967 --> 09:35.967
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
SHE'S BEEN IN THERE
AN AWFUL LONG TIME.

09:35.967 --> 09:38.300
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING SO CRAZY ABOUT?

09:38.300 --> 09:39.600
SHE'S JUST
GETTING A HAIRCUT.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.300
NO, COR. WE'VE KNOWN
TOPANGA ALL HER LIFE, OK?

09:41.300 --> 09:42.900
SHE DOESN'T WEAR MAKE-UP.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.767
SHE'S NEVER BEEN
TO A BEAUTY PARLOR.
SHE'S COMPLETELY NATURAL.

09:45.767 --> 09:47.300
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

09:47.300 --> 09:51.300
THE BIG DEAL IS
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL BEFORE
WITHOUT ANYBODY'S HELP.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.500
NOW SHE'S GOT
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.867
SHE'S GONNA BE
MEGA-BEAUTIFUL.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.400
WE'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA BE ABLE TO
LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY

09:56.400 --> 09:57.500
WITHOUT BURNING
OUR RETINAS.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.367
SHAWN, COME ON.
THIS IS NOT
BEVERLY HILLS.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.400
I MEAN, IT'S
A NEIGHBORHOOD
BEAUTY SALON

10:02.400 --> 10:03.900
NEXT TO
OLD LADY SCHNEIDER'S
DOUGHNUT SHOP.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.734
I MEAN,
THEY DON'T EXACTLY
DO MIRACLES HERE.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.600
OLD LADY SCHNEIDER.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.867
IT'S A MIRACLE!

10:15.233 --> 10:16.934
OH, NO.

10:16.934 --> 10:18.400
SHAWN, TOPANGA
IS GONNA COME OUT

10:18.400 --> 10:20.467
LOOKING 10 TIMES BETTER
THAN SHE DID
WHEN SHE WENT IN.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.834
OK, THE FIRST THING
SHE'S GONNA DO
IS DUMP YOU,

10:22.834 --> 10:23.900
THEN STARTING
HANGING OUT

10:23.900 --> 10:25.934
WITH OTHER UNBELIEVABLY
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE.

10:25.934 --> 10:27.100
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

10:27.100 --> 10:28.300
IT'S WHAT WE DO.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.667
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

10:29.667 --> 10:33.500
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S INTERESTING,
BUT, OH, SO WRONG.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.600
AND WHY IS THAT?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.734
BECAUSE IF ANYBODY
KNOWS HAIR, IT'S ME.

10:36.734 --> 10:37.934
WHEN I
GET A HAIRCUT,

10:37.934 --> 10:40.834
IT LOOKS TERRIBLE
FOR, LIKE,
THE FIRST SIX WEEKS.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.033
THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

10:42.033 --> 10:44.767
IT LOOKS TERRIFIC
FOR, LIKE, A DAY.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.233
THEN IT'S TIME
FOR ANOTHER HAIRCUT.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.100
IT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO CALL

10:48.100 --> 10:49.700
THE HAIRCUT CYCLE
OF SHAME.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.467
OK, AND THAT'S
WHAT YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO TOPANGA?

10:52.467 --> 10:54.867
YES, I DO BECAUSE
THE UNIVERSE KNOWS

10:54.867 --> 10:57.400
THAT TOPANGA AND I
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
TOGETHER,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.000
SO THE UNIVERSE
HAS SEEN FIT

10:59.000 --> 11:00.300
TO PUT TOPANGA
IN THAT CHAIR

11:00.300 --> 11:01.300
AND MAKE HER HIDEOUS

11:01.300 --> 11:03.200
SO WE CAN GET THROUGH
OUR TEENAGE YEARS

11:03.200 --> 11:06.233
AWKWARD HAND
IN AWKWARD HAND.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.400
YOU KNOW SHE'S COMING
OUT GREAT-LOOKING,
DON'T YOU?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.300
YES!

11:22.200 --> 11:23.400
THIS UNIVERSE BLOWS!

11:27.967 --> 11:29.600
WELL, ISN'T SOMEBODY
GOING TO SAY SOMETHING?

11:29.600 --> 11:30.834
SHE'S MY BEST
FRIEND'S GIRL...

11:30.834 --> 11:32.200
SHE'S MY BEST
FRIEND'S GIRL...

11:32.200 --> 11:33.300
OH, THE HECK
WITH THAT! MARRY ME!

11:33.300 --> 11:35.300
I LIVE IN A TRAILER PARK
AND I HAVE NO EDUCATION,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.100
BUT MY HAIR DOES THIS!

11:38.200 --> 11:39.200
SHAWN!

11:39.200 --> 11:41.667
SHUT UP, MAN!
I'M GOING FOR IT!

11:41.667 --> 11:43.200
THANKS. THANKS.
I'M BACK.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.200
GOOD.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.233
ALL RIGHT, TOPANGA,
I WANT--

11:46.233 --> 11:48.367
I WANT THE NAME OF THE GUY
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

11:48.367 --> 11:49.500
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.667
NO, NO, IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T LIKE IT,

11:50.667 --> 11:52.133
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS GIRL

11:52.133 --> 11:54.467
WHO WAS NEVER INTERESTED
IN WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE BEFORE,

11:54.467 --> 11:55.900
AND NOW I SEE MAKE-UP
ON YOUR FACE

11:55.900 --> 11:57.700
AND POLISH ON
YOUR NAILS AND TOES AND--

11:57.700 --> 11:59.200
STOP LOOKING AT HER TOES.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.000
BUT THEY
SPARKLE.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.500
I WANT THE NAME OF THE GUY
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.367
MY STYLIST'S NAME
IS MR. CELLINI.

12:05.367 --> 12:07.800
CORY, IT'S JUST A HAIRCUT.
IT'S JUST SOME MAKE-UP.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.200
IT'S NOT GOING
TO CHANGE ME.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.300
GOTTA GO.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.500
WELL, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

12:12.500 --> 12:13.734
THIS OUTFIT
WITH THIS HAIR?

12:13.734 --> 12:16.967
HELLO, BYE-BYE.
I AM SO AT THE MALL.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
THIS JUST ISN'T
LIKE TOPANGA.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.100
OBVIOUSLY, SHE'S
UNDER THE INFLUENCE

12:22.100 --> 12:23.600
OF THIS SO-CALLED
MR. CELLINI.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.967
YEAH. I SAY
WE GO BACK THERE.

12:24.967 --> 12:27.200
YOU ARE MY FRIEND,
AREN'T YOU?

12:27.200 --> 12:28.200
OF COURSE I AM.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.834
AND THAT LITTLE THING
WITH TOPANGA?

12:29.834 --> 12:34.200
WELL, I THINK
THE 3 OF US CAN BE
VERY HAPPY TOGETHER.

12:35.667 --> 12:39.600
ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE
OF YOU GUYS WORKED
ON TOPANGA LAWRENCE?

12:39.600 --> 12:43.100
AH, THAT WOULD BE ME--
BOSCO CELLINI.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.567
ALL RIGHT, BOSCO,
I WANT TO KNOW
WHERE YOU COME OFF

12:45.567 --> 12:47.100
TAKING A NATURAL BEAUTY
LIKE TOPANGA

12:47.100 --> 12:50.734
AND PAINTING HER FACE
AND NAILS AND MESSING
WITH HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR?

12:50.734 --> 12:51.734
"MESSING"?

12:51.734 --> 12:55.000
HEY, FRIEND TO
THE LITTLE WHINING BOY,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.600
DID HE SAY "MESSING"?

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
YEAH. THAT'S
WHAT I HEARD.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.500
WELL, FOR
YOUR<i>INFORMAZIONE,</i>

13:00.500 --> 13:02.734
IT IS VERY RARE
THAT ON A TUESDAY--

13:02.734 --> 13:03.867
OUR SLOW DAY--

13:03.867 --> 13:07.467
THAT VENUS DE MILO HERSELF
WOULD SIT IN MY CHAIR

13:07.467 --> 13:11.100
AND SAY TO ME,
"MAKE WITH ME
WHAT YOU WISH."

13:11.100 --> 13:15.400
I AM A EUROPEAN MAN
SECURE ENOUGH IN
MY OWN MASCULINITY

13:15.400 --> 13:17.934
TO ADMIT TO YOU
I WEPT.

13:17.934 --> 13:20.834
I CRIED LIKE
A LITTLE BABY CRIES.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.000
ALL RIGHT, BOSCO,
FIRST OF ALL,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.600
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF PHILADELPHIA
HERE,

13:23.600 --> 13:25.400
SO LET'S JUST DROP
THIS PHONY ACCENT.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.500
<i>SCUSI?</i>

13:26.500 --> 13:27.767
TALK IN ENGLISH!

13:29.200 --> 13:30.400
[BROOKLYN ACCENT]
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
HOW IT WENT DOWN.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.100
CHICKY COMES IN,
PLOPS DOWN A HALF
A C-NOTE, RIGHT?

13:34.100 --> 13:35.934
I DO A LITTLE
SNIPPETY-SNIP,

13:35.934 --> 13:39.734
BADDA-BOOM, BADDA-BING,
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S A LOOKER.

13:39.734 --> 13:43.867
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I MEAN, SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.100
OK, LET'S GO, BUDDY.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.467
THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT FOR YOU HERE.

13:46.467 --> 13:48.000
YOU DID A VERY NICE JOB.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.667
HEY, DON'T MENTION IT.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.367
SO I'M KIND OF AT
THE CROSSROADS OF MY LIFE

13:59.367 --> 14:02.100
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
GET INTO COLLEGE LIKE
THE REST OF MY FRIENDS.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.500
OH, YOU DIDN'T?

14:03.500 --> 14:06.767
NO. LOOKS LIKE
I'M KIND OF STUCK HERE
IN TOWN FOR A WHILE.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.400
IT'S NOT SO BAD.
REALLY.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
YOU GET USED
TO BEING HERE.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.000
YEAH, I MEAN,
I'M OK WITH IT.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.900
UM, ACTUALLY THOUGHT
THERE WAS A CAREER OUT THERE
FOR ME AS A WEATHERMAN.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.867
I EVEN INTERNED
AT CHANNEL 5.

14:17.867 --> 14:18.867
WOW.

14:18.867 --> 14:19.867
YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

14:19.867 --> 14:21.367
I GUESS THEY THOUGHT
I WAS TOO YOUNG

14:21.367 --> 14:22.934
AND DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH LIFE EXPERIENCE,

14:22.934 --> 14:24.500
WHICH, FRANKLY,
I THINK IS CRAZY.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.567
I MEAN, I'M 18.
I'VE LIVED, YOU KNOW?

14:25.567 --> 14:26.934
YEAH. I HEAR YOU.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.300
I'M 18, AND
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
SOME LIFE EXPERIENCE.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.567
YEAH?

14:31.567 --> 14:35.600
YEAH. I MEAN,
I HAVE A 2-YEAR-OLD
TO TAKE CARE OF.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.767
HE'S A BIG HANDFUL,

14:37.767 --> 14:40.600
AND IN BETWEEN
PUTTING HIM
IN DAYCARE

14:40.600 --> 14:43.233
AND WORKING
DOUBLE SHIFTS
AT THE DAIRY QUEEN,

14:43.233 --> 14:45.800
I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T
MIND A LITTLE LESS
LIFE EXPERIENCE.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.133
CAN'T YOUR PARENTS
HELP YOU?

14:48.133 --> 14:51.033
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR MOM AND DAD
HELPING YOU?

14:51.033 --> 14:53.900
WELL, YOU KNOW,
JUST...FINANCIALLY.

14:56.133 --> 14:58.367
THAT'S NICE.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.467
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY,
ERIC.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.033
YEAH, THANKS.

15:02.033 --> 15:04.734
I GUESS I'M LUCKIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.133
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
TAKE YOUR SEATS.
TAKE YOUR SEATS.

15:11.133 --> 15:15.133
WHAT IS SO INTERESTING
THAT YOU ALL HAVE
TO CROWD AROUND HERE--

15:15.133 --> 15:16.734
OH, BOY. LOOK AT YOU.

15:16.734 --> 15:18.000
YEAH. I GOT
A HAIRCUT.
DO YOU LIKE IT?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.600
HEY! HEY!
FOCUS, MR. TURNER.
SOME ARE HERE TO LEARN.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.667
OK, TODAY, WE'RE
GOING TO BE TALKING
ABOUT JOHN MERRICK,

15:23.667 --> 15:25.767
IMMORTALIZED IN THE PLAY
<i>THE ELEPHANT MAN.</i>

15:25.767 --> 15:29.000
NOW, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
TRAGICALLY DISFIGURED,

15:29.000 --> 15:31.700
HE STILL WON THE HEARTS
OF LONDON SOCIETY

15:31.700 --> 15:34.367
WITH HIS WONDERFUL
INNER SPIRIT.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.500
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.300
I COME FROM
A GREAT-LOOKING FAMILY,

15:37.300 --> 15:38.967
AND I'M JUST GOING THROUGH
MY AWKWARD TEENAGE PHASE,

15:38.967 --> 15:42.500
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T WIN THE HEARTS
OF HIGH SCHOOL SOCIETY

15:42.500 --> 15:44.000
WITH MY WONDERFUL
INNER SPIRIT.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.900
NOW, SEE, WHAT'S
REALLY INTERESTING
ABOUT JOHN MERRICK

15:46.900 --> 15:49.834
IS THAT HE CAME FROM
A WONDERFUL-LOOKING FAMILY,

15:49.834 --> 15:51.400
YET WAS SO HIDEOUS HIMSELF,

15:51.400 --> 15:53.600
HE WAS FORCED TO WEAR
A BURLAP SACK OVER HIS HEAD

15:53.600 --> 15:55.800
AND PERFORM
AS A SIDESHOW FREAK

15:55.800 --> 16:00.600
UNTIL THE DAY
THAT HIS OVERSIZED HEAD
ROLLED BACK AND HE DIED.

16:00.600 --> 16:05.300
AND WHEN DID HE GROW OUT
OF THIS...DEATH?

16:06.400 --> 16:07.400
ATTENTION, PLEASE.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.500
EXCUSE THE INTERRUPTION,
MR. TURNER.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.033
A REMINDER THAT
THIS FRIDAY IS PICTURE DAY,

16:13.033 --> 16:17.567
SO, PLEASE, DRESS NICELY
AND TRY TO LOOK YOUR BEST.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.000
CARRY ON.

16:29.934 --> 16:30.934
SHAWN?

16:30.934 --> 16:31.934
YEAH?

16:31.934 --> 16:33.100
I JUST WANT TO DIE.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.600
PLEASE DON'T LIFT
MY OVERSIZED HEAD.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.834
OH, MR. CELLINI,
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME!

16:41.834 --> 16:45.033
<i>SI, </i>CELLINI IS HERE
TO HELP.

16:45.033 --> 16:47.500
OH, IT'S YOU,
THE LITTLE WHINY KID.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.600
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE THAT GUY.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.300
I WANT YOU TO BE
CELLINI THE ARTIST.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.400
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME
LIKE YOU HELPED TOPANGA.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.700
FORGET IT!
I DON'T TAKE WALK-INS.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.600
YOU DON'T WALK IN HERE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON

16:55.600 --> 16:56.667
AND EXPECT ME
TO TAKE A WALK-IN.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.100
WELL, I'M WALKIN' IN
WITH 75 BUCKS.

16:59.100 --> 17:03.800
<i>ATTENCIONE!  </i>CAPPUCCINO FOR THE
WHINY KID.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.233

17:23.467 --> 17:26.367
WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING?

17:26.367 --> 17:28.000
THIS IS WHO
I AM NOW, DADDY.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.800
I'M A TOWNIE.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.200
I'M WORSE THAN A TOWNIE
BECAUSE I RELY ON MY PARENTS
FOR ECONOMIC SUPPORT.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
I DIDN'T EVEN BUY
THIS CEREAL.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.767
YOU BOUGHT THIS CEREAL.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.100
YOU BOUGHT MY CLOTHES.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.300
YOU BOUGHT THIS CEREAL.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.567
YOU BOUGHT THE MILK WHICH
WAS WHITE WHEN IT STARTED,

17:40.567 --> 17:43.000
BUT IT'S CHOCOLATE NOW
BECAUSE IT'S COCOA-PUFFS

17:43.000 --> 17:45.600
AND I'VE BEEN SITTING
HERE FOR 9 HOURS.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
YEAH?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.300
GET OFF
YOUR BUTT.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.400
GET A JOB.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.567
HUH? RIGHT NOW!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.800
THANK YOU, DADDY.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.200
SO HERE'S
HOW I SEE IT.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.400
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS
REALLY CAN'T MAKE IT
A HABIT TO BE IN HERE.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.867

THESE TWO PEOPLE,

18:12.867 --> 18:17.600

THEY'RE MY TWO BEST
FRIENDS IN THE WORLD.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.934
ANYBODY I KNOW?

18:18.934 --> 18:20.200
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

18:20.200 --> 18:24.100
ONE OF THEM,
WHO IN MY OPINION
IS A GOOD-LOOKING GUY,

18:24.100 --> 18:27.000
IS GOING THROUGH
A SHAKY TIME RIGHT NOW.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.767
WHERE IS CORY?

18:28.767 --> 18:32.567
THAT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT
AS WHERE YOU ARE, TOPANGA.

18:32.567 --> 18:33.767
IN ALL THE TIME
THAT I'VE KNOWN YOU,

18:33.767 --> 18:36.800
I CAN'T REMEMBER YOU
EVER LOOKING IN THE MIRROR.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.600
YOU HAD THIS CONFIDENCE
IN YOURSELF,

18:38.600 --> 18:40.033
AND I REALLY
LIKED THAT ABOUT YOU.

18:40.033 --> 18:41.567
COME ON, SHAWN,
EVERYBODY
IN HIGH SCHOOL

18:41.567 --> 18:43.000
HAS A MIRROR
IN THEIR LOCKER

18:43.000 --> 18:45.500
AND CHECKS EACH OTHER
OUT AND ONLY CARES
ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.600
BUT UP UNTIL
A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
YOU NEVER DID.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.233
YOUR WORLD
GOT COMPLETELY ROCKED

18:50.233 --> 18:52.400
WHEN YOU HACKED YOUR HAIR OFF
AND SAW THAT FOR 2 SECONDS

18:52.400 --> 18:55.867
YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK
A LITTLE LESS THAN PERFECT.

18:59.367 --> 19:01.667
THIS ISN'T ME,
IS IT, SHAWN?

19:01.667 --> 19:04.400
WELL, IT'S NOT
THE TOPANGA I KNOW.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.667
BUT OBVIOUSLY
WE'RE ALL AT THAT AGE

19:06.667 --> 19:09.300
WHERE WE'RE
GOING THROUGH CHANGES.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.233
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
THANKS.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.800
STOP! STOP!
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH HIM!

19:21.800 --> 19:24.467
TOO LATE.
I AM<i>FINITO</i>

19:24.467 --> 19:28.500
AND PROUD TO SAY
THIS IS MY BEST
WORK EVER.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.500
EVERYTHING I HAVE DONE
UNTIL NOW WAS DRECK.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.600
THIS IS MY MASTERPIECE!

19:38.500 --> 19:40.367
OH. OH, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

19:40.367 --> 19:45.367
OF COURSE! I HAVE
HAD TO CALL UPON ALL
OF MY SKILLS AND POWERS.

19:45.367 --> 19:46.500
I REALLY LOOK OK?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.567
I THINK I'M FALLING
IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.467
AND YOU,
YOU WET RODENT!

19:54.467 --> 19:56.300
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO MY WORK?

19:56.300 --> 20:00.367
ONCE AGAIN,
AS A EUROPEAN, I WEEP
WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.200
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:05.200 --> 20:06.700
SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.367
JUST LIKE
SHE ALWAYS WAS.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.100
YOU, TOO, CORY.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.100
JUST LIKE
YOU ALWAYS WERE.

20:20.834 --> 20:24.300
MOM? DAD?
I DID WHAT YOU SAID.
I GOT A JOB.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.700
ERIC, WE'RE
PROUD OF YOU.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.133
HEY, WHAT KIND OF JOB
DID YOU GET?

20:27.133 --> 20:29.400

ERIC, WAKE UP!

21:03.300 --> 21:05.400

21:06.500 --> 21:07.667

21:07.667 --> 21:08.734
