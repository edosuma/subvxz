I feel sorry
for you,  princesa.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.460
Why?

01:15.460 --> 01:16.710
Because I'm about
to do this!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.830
Now I feel sorry
for you, Skylar.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.500
because I wanna
do it again!

01:27.500 --> 01:30.460
Ho ho, you asked for it!

01:35.830 --> 01:37.830
I used to hike to these
mountains when I was a kid,

01:37.830 --> 01:41.790
but I never had
a view like this.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.620
But I do not remember
that monfuego being active.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.670
Oh, yeah, that happened
while you were gone.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.960
This rock monster moved in,
and don't ask me how,

01:49.960 --> 01:51.670
but whenever he gets angry,

01:51.670 --> 01:53.120
the monfuego
starts to erupt.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.790
Looks like he's having
a bad day.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.620
Let's not make it
worse, okay?

01:57.620 --> 01:59.880
Hey, how about we go through
the waterfall this time?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.500
Come on, let's go!

02:09.290 --> 02:11.210
Yeah, that's right.

02:11.210 --> 02:13.120
You better run,

02:13.120 --> 02:16.000
'cause Charoca is comin'.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.290
Oh, yeah?

02:24.500 --> 02:27.960
That's right. No one
beats me in a funny-face war.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.880
No day, no way.

02:29.880 --> 02:34.500
Now y'all stay off
my mountain!

02:36.830 --> 02:39.120
Uh-oh. Okay,
gotta chill out.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.830
Deep breaths.

02:40.830 --> 02:43.120
In with the cool,
out with the hot.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.620
The cool mountain stream
carries the red-hot anger away.

02:46.620 --> 02:49.290
Stay calm, stay cool.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.080
Stay calm...

02:51.080 --> 02:52.710
stay cool.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.790
Stay calm.

02:54.790 --> 02:55.960
Stay cool.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.290
The monster made
a face at me.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.120
He chased my little Damon.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.290
He's going to make
the monfuego erupt.

03:04.290 --> 03:05.790
Erupt?

03:08.960 --> 03:11.790
Oh. Sorry.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.880
My sister built
this new kind of chair,

03:13.880 --> 03:16.460
but it's a little squeaky.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.540
Go on.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.120
Our village is at
the foot of the mountain.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.120
If the monfuego erupts,

03:23.120 --> 03:26.210
the lava could
destroy everything.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.460
Please do something,
Princess Elena.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.540
It is not just
up to the princess.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.330
A matter this important
must be decided upon

03:33.330 --> 03:35.830
by a majority of
the entire Grand Council.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.790
¿Que?

03:37.790 --> 03:39.880
He means we have to vote
on what to do.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.880
Oh!

03:41.880 --> 03:43.960
And I say we throw
the monster out of Avalor.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.120
Throw him out?

03:45.120 --> 03:46.790
I must agree with Esteban.

03:46.790 --> 03:49.120
This is a matter
of public safety.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.790
- Does this...

03:50.790 --> 03:53.120
Sorry. Does this monster
have a name?

03:53.120 --> 03:57.620
He calls himself Charoca!

03:57.620 --> 03:59.830
Well, since the monfuego
only rumbles

03:59.830 --> 04:01.880
when Charoca is angry,

04:01.880 --> 04:03.710
has anybody asked him
why he's so upset?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.710
Asked him?

04:05.710 --> 04:08.120
There is no talking to
a monster like that.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.620
We must take action!

04:11.790 --> 04:14.880
- Ooh! That is really
tough on the ears, isn't it?

04:14.880 --> 04:16.670
Okay.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.790
What are you doing?

04:18.790 --> 04:21.120
Throwing out the chair.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.670
But it only has
a little squeak.

04:22.670 --> 04:24.670
Why not try and fix it?

04:24.670 --> 04:26.210
Exactly! Mm-hmm.

04:26.210 --> 04:27.710
I would never throw
something out

04:27.710 --> 04:29.620
without trying
to fix it first.

04:29.620 --> 04:31.500
So why should
we throw out Charoca

04:31.500 --> 04:33.500
before trying to fix
that problem, hm?

04:33.500 --> 04:35.120
Ah!

04:35.120 --> 04:36.710
Let me go talk to him

04:36.710 --> 04:39.000
and find out what's making
him so angry.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.120
Then, maybe I can
get him to calm down, okay?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.670
Let's vote on it!

04:42.670 --> 04:45.830
All those in favor of
me talking to Charoca.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.000
I see no harm in trying.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.710
Unless he roasts her.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.960
But if you wanna
give it a try, go for it.

04:55.620 --> 04:59.170
Only if you're escorted
by the Royal Guard.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.880
Mmm, it's a deal.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.620
- Wish me luck!

05:04.710 --> 05:08.790
Princess Elena, your escort
is assembled and ready.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.880
Uh, it's a friendly
visit, Gabe, not an invasion.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.710
But your grandfather said
it was too dangerous
to go there alone.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.500
All right then,
saddle up.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.380
You heard the princess.
Let's go.

05:22.380 --> 05:25.960
Oh, not them. Just you.
Then I won't be alone.

05:27.170 --> 05:28.710
Did you hear that, guys?

05:28.710 --> 05:30.880
She just needs me.

05:30.880 --> 05:33.290
You sure about that?

05:33.290 --> 05:35.120
Go, Canela.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.790
Follow that princess.

05:42.830 --> 05:46.620
All right, if the monster
attacks, I gotcha covered.

05:46.620 --> 05:49.460
Gabe, look.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.500
Does this look like
a place where a monster lives?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.290
- Whoa!
- Princess!

05:56.290 --> 05:59.040
He booby-trapped the perimeter.
Fall back, fall back!

05:59.040 --> 06:00.710
Gabe, it's just a hole.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.790
It could be a booby trap
disguised as a hole.

06:04.790 --> 06:08.620
You can put that away.
All right? I brought
my own secret weapon.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.290
Nobody can resist
Avaloran chocolate.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.960
Stay here.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.830
Hello

06:29.710 --> 06:32.710
Señor Charoca?

06:32.710 --> 06:34.790
Oh, guess I'll just wait.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.290
Get off me!

06:39.290 --> 06:42.040
So you think it's all right
to just come in my house

06:42.040 --> 06:43.670
and sit on me?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.330
I'm sorry.

06:45.330 --> 06:46.790
I thought you were a chair.

06:46.790 --> 06:47.880
So I look like
a chair to you?

06:47.880 --> 06:49.460
No, no, no, no.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.210
Let's start over.
I'm Princess-

06:51.210 --> 06:54.120
I don't care who you are.
I told you kids to stay away.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.290
Okay, okay, there's no need
to get all heated up.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.290
Is that supposed to be
some kind of joke?

06:59.290 --> 07:00.830
What? No.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.290
I was just... truffle?

07:02.290 --> 07:04.380
Get out!

07:04.380 --> 07:06.960
Wait! Gabe.

07:18.620 --> 07:21.620
- I had it all under control.
- Obviously.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.170
Lieutenant Nuñez,
I wish to thank you

07:24.170 --> 07:25.830
for rescuing
my granddaughter.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.170
I didn't need rescuing.

07:27.170 --> 07:29.620
Your appearance
suggests otherwise.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.620
First, this monster
attacked the children,

07:31.620 --> 07:34.290
and now, he's attacked
the Crown Princess.

07:34.290 --> 07:36.830
- I wouldn't say attacked.
- I would.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.790
We should throw him
out of the kingdom

07:38.790 --> 07:40.620
before someone else
gets hurt.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.620
I don't think
he'd hurt anyone.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.710
How do you know?

07:43.710 --> 07:45.290
I just have a feeling.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.710
Elena, feelings
are important

07:47.710 --> 07:49.710
but rulers
must deal with facts.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.710
And we know for a fact
that the monster is a danger

07:51.710 --> 07:54.000
to everyone in
the kingdom.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.330
I say we vote to
remove him from
Avalor immediately.

07:56.330 --> 07:58.620
All in favor.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.170
Abuela?

08:01.170 --> 08:03.790
I understand
how you feel, Elena,

08:03.790 --> 08:06.000
but nobody attacks
my  familia

08:06.000 --> 08:08.460
and gets away with it.

08:08.460 --> 08:09.790
Charoca has to go.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.170
Naomi?

08:11.170 --> 08:14.670
- Sorry, Elena.
- Fine.

08:14.670 --> 08:18.290
Lieutenant Nuñez,
assemble the Royal Guard.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.710
At once, chancellor.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.460
Look, Elena.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.170
This rock got so hot,
it turned into glass.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.620
That's great, Isabel.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.670
You didn't even
look at it.

08:27.670 --> 08:29.670
I'm sorry.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.960
It's just not a good...

08:31.960 --> 08:33.710
Wait. Where did
you get that?

08:33.710 --> 08:36.460
From one of my friends.
They're getting them
from the monfuego.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.460
They call them
monster rocks.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.620
That's why he's so mad.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.120
- I have to go.
- Hey, my rock.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.830
It's not your rock.
It's his!

08:47.460 --> 08:50.210
Skylar, I need you to take me
back to the monfuego.

08:50.210 --> 08:53.120
Oh, not the one with
the angry rock monster.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.290
That's the one.

08:54.290 --> 08:55.620
Nice knowin'
you, Skylar.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.540
Can I have your nest
when you're gone?

08:56.540 --> 08:58.790
Ooh, sorry,  princesa.

08:58.790 --> 09:02.670
Wish I could help,
but I have a cramp
in my left wing.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.170
That's your right wing.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.290
It's spreading.

09:06.290 --> 09:08.290
Come on, Skylar, please.

09:08.290 --> 09:11.960
Oh. Oh, not the sad
puppy dog eyes.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.000
You know I cannot
resist them.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.040
Okay, let's go.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.380
- Thanks.
- Elena.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.620
I'm sorry I voted
against you.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.830
It's okay, Naomi.
I get it.

09:21.830 --> 09:24.170
You had to do
what you thought was right.

09:24.170 --> 09:27.670
- And now, I have to do
what I think is right.

09:27.670 --> 09:30.790
I have a pretty good idea
why Charoca's so angry.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.380
I just need to make sure.

09:32.380 --> 09:33.710
You're not going...

09:33.710 --> 09:34.960
Sure am.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.710
Well, then I'm
coming with you.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.790
You are

09:38.790 --> 09:40.460
Because you're
my best friend,

09:40.460 --> 09:42.620
even if we don't
always agree.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.670
And as your friend,
there is no way

09:44.670 --> 09:46.790
I am letting you
go alone.

09:46.790 --> 09:48.620
- Luna.

09:48.620 --> 09:52.460
Uh-uh. Last thing I'm gonna
do is go anywhere near
that monfuego.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.790
Isn't this great, Luna?

09:54.790 --> 09:58.620
You and me, partners on
a risky, dangerous
death-defying mission.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.880
Right now, I wish
you were a silent partner.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.620
Two jaquins going in,
only one may come out.

10:04.620 --> 10:07.170
You keep talking and only
one will come out.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.120
I've got more monster
rocks than you do.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.960
Look out. Princess.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.880
Who are you calling
a princess?

10:16.880 --> 10:19.330
Hi there.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.790
Whoa.

10:20.790 --> 10:21.960
What's your name?

10:21.960 --> 10:23.620
Bella.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.620
Those are pretty
rocks, Bella.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.120
We got 'em from
the monster.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.790
I see.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.120
Did he say you could
take them?

10:30.120 --> 10:32.670
He didn't say
we couldn't.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.540
And he's a monster.

10:34.540 --> 10:36.670
Well, just because
he's different

10:36.670 --> 10:38.380
doesn't make him
a monster.

10:38.380 --> 10:41.460
And it doesn't mean
it's okay to take his things.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.960
Sorry.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.960
You, too.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.540
We better get up there fast.

10:54.540 --> 10:57.040
Stay calm, stay cool, Charoca.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.500
In with the cool.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.290
Out with the hot.

11:02.290 --> 11:05.710
- Stop. That one.

11:05.710 --> 11:08.620
- No, the other way.
- You just had it
the other way.

11:08.620 --> 11:09.960
You again?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.210
It's not what you think.

11:12.210 --> 11:13.790
Look.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.620
You brought them back.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.790
Sandy, Crystal,
I missed you so much.

11:20.790 --> 11:22.290
Oh, Jasper.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.880
He named his rocks?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.620
You got a problem
with that?

11:25.620 --> 11:27.290
Not me.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.790
- Hi, Sandy.
- That's Jasper.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.710
I didn't get the chance
to introduce myself before.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.880
I am Crown Princess Elena.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.960
You're the crown princess?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.120
And you brought back
my rocks.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.880
That's all I wanted.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.120
- Thank you,
Your Majesty.
- You're welcome.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.540
Most people don't treat me
with that kind of respect.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.170
Well, they should.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.830
When people look at me,

11:51.830 --> 11:53.830
all they see
is a monster.

11:53.830 --> 11:56.040
But just because
I'm made of rock

11:56.040 --> 11:58.330
doesn't mean
I don't have feelings.

anger management issues.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.540
Yes, but I'm
working on that.

14:52.540 --> 14:53.880
You know, breathing
exercises,

14:53.880 --> 14:56.620
gardening, let's see,
meditating.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.790
You guys, I'm trying.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.290
Well, don't worry, Charoca.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.670
Nobody will treat you
like a monster ever again.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.290
Seize that monster!

15:06.290 --> 15:08.540
What? Esteban.
Stop!

15:08.540 --> 15:10.330
He's not a monster.

15:10.330 --> 15:12.040
I thought you wanted
to be my friend,

15:12.040 --> 15:14.540
but you were just
setting me up
for a sneak attack.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.620
That's not true.
I'm trying to help.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.620
Uh-oh, he's getting angry.

15:22.460 --> 15:24.380
I'll save you, princess.

15:24.380 --> 15:25.710
Grab him.

15:25.710 --> 15:28.330
No. Leave him alone.

15:28.330 --> 15:29.790
They want a monster,

15:29.790 --> 15:31.960
I'll give them a monster.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.620
Fall back.

15:35.620 --> 15:37.620
Wait. No.
Where are you going?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.540
Ow!

15:39.540 --> 15:41.790
Princesa, hop on.

15:41.790 --> 15:44.880
It's okay, guys.
It's gonna be okay.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.960
Sorry. They just
make me so angry!

15:57.290 --> 15:59.000
What do you think
you're doing?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.670
And you are
helping her?

16:00.670 --> 16:02.210
We were doing fine until--

16:02.210 --> 16:05.380
You defied the vote
of the council, Elena.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.290
And now I must
inform them of
the fiasco you created.

16:08.290 --> 16:10.540
Attacking him
is what caused all this.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.460
The lava's coming!

16:12.460 --> 16:14.670
It's headed
right for the schoolhouse.

16:16.330 --> 16:18.460
I have an idea,
Your Majesty.

16:18.460 --> 16:21.460
We can build a barricade
to divert the lava
away from the school.

16:21.460 --> 16:23.460
But how can we
put it up so quickly?

16:23.460 --> 16:26.460
With a squadron of
the bravest royal guards
in the kingdom.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.620
- And me.
- And us.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.620
Okay then,
let's save the village.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.330
That should do it.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.880
Here it comes.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.120
Everybody back!

16:54.210 --> 16:55.620
It's holding!

16:55.620 --> 16:57.380
We did it!

16:57.380 --> 16:59.620
Yes!

16:59.620 --> 17:01.620
No!

17:01.620 --> 17:04.830
The lava.
My house, my friends.

17:04.830 --> 17:07.500
- We've gotta help Charoca.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.830
I got you, Jaden, Gemma.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.290
I am sorry, guys.
I lost my temper,

17:14.290 --> 17:16.540
and now, the monfuego
is erupting.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.620
I gotta cool down.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.460
Out with the hot,
in with the cool.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.170
Stay calm, stay cool.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.790
That's it.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.620
Feel better, guys?

17:26.620 --> 17:28.540
No. The lava!

17:28.540 --> 17:31.670
Maybe I can cool the lava down
like I did you guys,

17:31.670 --> 17:33.830
if I stay cool,

17:33.830 --> 17:36.620
Okay, stay cool.
Stay calm.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.170
Out with the hot,
in with the cool.

17:39.170 --> 17:41.040
Out, hot,
in, cool.

17:41.040 --> 17:44.210
- Out hot!
- ELENA: Charoca!

17:44.210 --> 17:46.170
Now!

17:48.330 --> 17:49.620
Bull's-eye!

17:55.380 --> 17:58.790
You... saved my house.

17:58.790 --> 18:02.500
Well, I did spend a long time
fixing up that garden.

18:03.620 --> 18:05.790
And it's my duty
as princess

18:05.790 --> 18:08.120
to protect everyone
who lives in Avalor.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.670
Including you.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.460
The monfuego
stopped erupting.

18:16.460 --> 18:18.460
Uh, we've still
got a problem.

18:18.460 --> 18:20.460
Look!

18:20.460 --> 18:22.790
ELENA: We saved the school,
but the lava is headed

18:22.790 --> 18:24.460
straight for the village.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.790
- We have to get more water.
- There's no time.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.960
- I did this.
- Because they attacked you.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.540
It doesn't matter.
I lost my cool,

18:32.540 --> 18:34.000
and now,
they're all in danger

18:34.000 --> 18:35.620
because of me.

18:40.790 --> 18:43.620
I can save them.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.330
Charoca?
What are you doing?

18:47.330 --> 18:49.170
Charoca!

18:49.170 --> 18:51.670
The lava's coming.
Everyone, get back!

18:59.710 --> 19:01.880
I can stop this lava...

19:01.880 --> 19:04.460
if I stay cool.

19:04.460 --> 19:07.540
You are a calm,
cool Charoca.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.120
Out with the hot,
in with the cool.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.620
Stay calm, stay cool.

19:16.620 --> 19:20.670
Stay calm,
stay cool.

19:20.670 --> 19:22.790
Stay calm, stay cool.

19:22.790 --> 19:26.460
Stay calm, stay...

19:30.210 --> 19:32.380
The monster saved us!

19:32.380 --> 19:34.000
He's no monster.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.120
He's a hero.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.540
Charoca!

19:40.040 --> 19:41.620
Charoca?

19:41.620 --> 19:43.330
Oh.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.880
I stayed cool.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.710
You did.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.960
You really did.

20:22.120 --> 20:27.000
Um, sorry we took
your rocks, Señor Charoca.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.790
That's okay.
Want a monfuego

20:30.790 --> 20:32.960
Ready?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.460
Aha! There she is.

20:37.460 --> 20:39.120
Princess Elena
disobeyed our vote,

20:39.120 --> 20:41.290
and took matters
into her own hands.

20:41.290 --> 20:43.710
I was only trying to do
what I thought was right.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.290
And she was right.

20:45.290 --> 20:46.620
We were wrong
about Charoca.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.790
You may have been
right this time, Elena,

20:49.790 --> 20:51.710
but the law is the law.

20:51.710 --> 20:54.790
And as Crown Princess,
you must respect the decision

20:54.790 --> 20:56.540
of the Grand Council.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.960
But sometimes,
the heart knows best, Francisco.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.040
She has a point.
Just sayin'.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.960
I'll tell you what,  abuelo.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.120
Next time, I'll do
what the council decides,

21:07.120 --> 21:09.960
if you promise to have
a more open heart.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.000
That I can promise.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.210
Okay then.

21:14.210 --> 21:15.790
Enough royal business.

21:15.790 --> 21:18.000
We're missing the party.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.500
We're not missing the party.
The party's missing us!

21:23.790 --> 21:25.380
Princess Elena.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.540
I thought my only
friends in the world

21:27.540 --> 21:29.210
were my rocks,
but, um...

21:29.210 --> 21:31.500
looks like
I was wrong.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.290
So this is for you,
For being my friend.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.170
Thank you.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.620
What a lovely rock.

21:38.620 --> 21:41.120
It's a caldorose.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.790
It only grows
on the monfuego.

21:43.790 --> 21:47.790
A special flower
for a special princess.

21:47.790 --> 21:51.170
Rough on the outside,
but beautiful on the inside.

21:51.170 --> 21:53.290
Just like you.
