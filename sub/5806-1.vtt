You can't payyour rent,

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.600
That makes no sense?

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:03.100
Oh, it doesn't, huh?

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.200

When, Mookie?

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.600
Don't worry about it?

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:19.500
Don't come here no more?

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.500
We're not talking about that?

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:24.300
I'm tired ofsupporting
a grown woman, OK?

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.200
I'm tired ofsupporting
a grown man, OK?

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.600
When areyou going

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.100
Don't come in Sal's no more?

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.300
And no more pizza, either?

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.200

01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.700
you better not say it?

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.200
You hear this?

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:54.200
Do me a favor?
LeaveJade alone?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.700
You know, Mookie,
not for nothir,

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.700
but ifyou were
just a little taller,

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.700
I'd kickyour ass
forwhatyou're thinking?

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.600
As a matter offact,

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:07.500
I should kickyour ass
on principle alone?

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.700

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.600
I wrote it myself?

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.200
Sometimes you make mistakes,

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.900
and I deliver fucking pizzas

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.700
to the wrong fucking address?

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:29.300
I don't make mistakes?

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.800

I saw whatyou did?

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.500
That was foolish but brave?

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.900
That child owes you his life?

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:56.500
Wasrt trying to be a hero?

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.800
I just seen what was happening,

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.200
and I reacted... didn't even think?

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.200
Probablywouldn't have done it

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.600
ifl had thought?

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.100
Da Mayor's getting old?

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.600
Ain't run like that in years?

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:12.100
Went from first to home
on a bunt single?

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.600
Scored the winning run?

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.100
Two outs?

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:22.600
He hated my guts?

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.900
He come down offthat mound,

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.500
and I took off

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:30.200
like white lightning
up a black snake's ass?

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.300
Maybe I, uh??

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:35.900
Maybe I ought to be
a hero more often?

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.400
Maybeyou shouldn't?

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:38.800
Don't get happy?

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.600

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.300
I didn't?

01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:35.500
I hope the block is still standing?

01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.300
We're still standing?

01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:19.700
What doyou want?

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:22.100
I want my money?
I want to get paid?

01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:24.300
You don't work here no more?

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:25.500
I want my money?

01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.500
Your money couldn't begin to pay

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:28.900
for the windowyou broke?

01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.500
Motherfuck a window?
Radio Raheem is dead?

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.900
I know he's dead?
I was here, remember?

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:35.900
He's dead because ofhis buddy?

01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:37.500
That cocksucker started this shit?

01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:39.500
He's responsible
for that kid's death?

01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.900
He wanted to close me,

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.500
and you stood there like a fuck

01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:45.500
and watched them
burn me down!

01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:47.800
I also watched the cops
murder Radio Raheem?

01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:51.400
You'll get it all
from the insurance anyway, Sal?

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.400
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:54.700
This ain't about money?

01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:56.700
I could give a fuck
about money?

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:57.900
You see this place?

01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:00.400
I built this fucking place!

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.600
With my bare fucking hands!

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.700
Every light socket,
every piece oftile?

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.700
Me! With these fucking hands!

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:09.700
You know what that means?

01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:12.300
It means pay me
my motherfucking money?

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.900
That's what it means, Sal?

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.900
OK, Mookie?

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:18.300

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:01.700
You're a real fucking Rockefeller?

01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:06.100
You gotyour fucking pay?
Now leave me alone?

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.100

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:24.900
I don't believe this shit?

01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:26.300
Believe it?

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:29.900
Areyou sick?

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:26.100
