WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:12.479
>>> AND NOW, A HOLIDAY MESSAGE
FROM DR. ANTHONY FAUCI.

00:12.479 --> 00:28.228
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> I'M BACK!
HI, EVERYONE.

00:28.228 --> 00:31.998
IT'S ME, DR. FAUCI.
DO PEOPLE STILL THINK I'M SEXY,
OR ARE WE DONE WITH THAT?

00:31.998 --> 00:36.169
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.
PEOPLE SEE ME ON TV, THEY THINK,
"THIS CAN'T BE GOOD."

00:36.169 --> 00:45.912
CHILDREN THINK, "WOW, THAT ELF
ON THE SHELF GOT OLD."
ANYWAY, AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY

00:45.912 --> 00:47.480
HEARD, THERE IS
AN OMICRON WAVE SWEEPING THE
GLOBE.

00:47.480 --> 00:56.956
SO SOME EXPERTS SEE THAT THE
OMICRON VARIANT WOULD BE VACCINE
RESISTANT, KIND OF LIKE, I DON'T

00:56.956 --> 00:59.526
KNOW, 40% OF AMERICANS.
MORE RECENT DATA SUGGESTS THAT
IF YOU HAD A VACCINE AND A

00:59.526 --> 01:01.761
BOOSTER YOU SHOULD BE PRETTY
WELL PROTECTED.
SO IF THAT'S YOU, I'D LIKE TO

01:01.761 --> 01:09.736
OFFICIALLY SAY, UNCLENCH.
WITH COVID CASES ON THE RISE,
PEOPLE STILL HAVE A LOT OF

01:09.736 --> 01:12.572
QUESTIONS.
IS IT SAFE TO TRAVEL?
CAN I STILL USE THIS AS AN

01:12.572 --> 01:18.945
EXCUSE TO GET OUT OF STUFF?
I WOULD LIKE TO NEVER WORK
AGAIN.

01:18.945 --> 01:22.749
WELL, TO HELP ANSWER THESE
QUERIES I ONCE AGAIN INVITED
MEMBERS OF THE CDC TO ACT OUT

01:22.749 --> 01:32.826
VARIOUS HOLIDAY SCENELETS, WHICH
PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, THEY'RE
NOT PROFESSIONAL ACTORS OR

01:32.826 --> 01:34.794
AMATEUR ACTORS.
THEY'RE NERDS WHO ARE TRYING
THEIR BEST.

01:34.794 --> 01:37.097
SO PLEASE WELCOME THE CDC
PLAYERS.
THE FIRST SCENE IS CALLED "GOING

01:37.097 --> 01:39.199
TO A RESTAURANT."
>> HI.
I'D LIKE TO EAT CHRISTMAS DINNER

01:39.199 --> 01:41.601
AT YOUR RESTAURANT, PLEASE.
>> SURE.
AND I JUST NEED TO SEE YOUR

01:41.601 --> 01:45.772
VACCINATION CARD.
>> I ACTUALLY CAN'T FIND IT.
>> YOU MEAN YOU LOST THE LITTLE

01:45.772 --> 01:53.313
ONE INCH PIECE OF CARD BOARD
THEY GAVE YOU?
>> I'M AFRAID SO.

01:53.313 --> 02:00.787
>> THEN URBANISHED FROM SOCIETY.
HAVE FUN LIVING IN THE WOODS.
>> AND SCENE.

02:00.787 --> 02:08.728
>> THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
YOU CAN GET A REPLACEMENT CARD.
I THINK.

02:08.728 --> 02:11.064
THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET
VACCINATED AND IF YOU'RE
VACCINATED GET BOOSTERS, AND IF

02:11.064 --> 02:17.704
YOU'RE BOOSTED MAYBE YOU WANT A
LITTLE TOP OFF.
A LITTLE SPLASH.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.339
I DON'T KNOW.
ANY WAY, LET'S HOPE THIS NEXT
SCENE GOES BETTER.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.175
IT IS CALLED "MILE-HIGH
CHRISTMAS."
>> STEWARDESS, I'M TRAVELING

02:22.175 --> 02:25.845
HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND I'M
SCARED THAT I'LL GET COVID ON
THE AIRPLANE.

02:25.845 --> 02:36.089
>> DON'T BE.
AIR TRAVEL IS FAIRLY LOW RISK.
>> GREAT.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.158
I ALSO HEARD GIRLS CAN'T GET
PREGNANT IN THE SKY.
IS THAT TRUE?

02:38.158 --> 02:45.498
>> I DON'T KNOW, KING.
LET'S FIND OUT.
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE, AND THAT'S

02:45.498 --> 02:53.740
NOT EVEN HOW SEX WORKS UNLESS
SOMETHING HAS CHANGED.
I GUESS PEOPLE GOT PRETTY LONELY

02:53.740 --> 02:58.411
DURING COVID, HUH?
YEAH.
YEAH.

02:58.411 --> 03:09.189
NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW
CHRISTMAS PRA DIGGSS MIGHT LOOK
DIFFERENT THIS YEAR IN A TRIP TO

03:09.189 --> 03:13.927
THE MALL.
>> SORRY.
YOU CAN'T SIT ON MY LAP ANYMORE.

03:13.927 --> 03:20.967
THANKS TO THE VACCINE, MY TEST
VALUES HAVE BALLOONED IN SIZE.
THEY'RE AS BIG AS GRAPES NOW.

03:20.967 --> 03:25.705
>> REALLY?
>> NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S JUST A CONSPIRACY THEORY,

03:25.705 --> 03:32.645
AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT
PARTICULAR MAN.
NOW THE PANDEMIC ALSO AFFECTED

03:32.645 --> 03:34.647
PEOPLE ECONOMICALLY.
KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU WATCH
THIS NEXT SCENE, "TWO UNEMPLOYED

03:34.647 --> 03:37.851
BROTHERS ON CHRISTMAS DAY."
>> HELLO.
I'M DISGRACED FORMER NEW YORK

03:37.851 --> 03:47.627
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.
>> AND I'M DISGRACED FORMER CNN
HOST CHRIS CUOMO.

03:47.627 --> 04:04.144
>> AND WE BOTH LOST OUR JOBS
BECAUSE OF COVID.
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

04:04.144 --> 04:08.515
UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE WERE NOT
THE LAST PUBLIC FIGURES YOU'LL
SEE TONIGHT BECAUSE WHEN IT

04:08.515 --> 04:11.117
COMES TO ACTING DEEPLY OFFENDED
ABOUT SOMETHING MINOR SOME OF
OUR MOST GIFTED PERFORMERS THESE

04:11.117 --> 04:17.424
DAYS COME NOT ONLY FROM
HOLLYWOOD BUT CONGRESS,
INCLUDING THE LADIES IN THIS

04:17.424 --> 04:22.629
NEXT SCENE, "CHRISTMAS ---"
>> HI, I'M LAUREN BOEBERT AND
SHE'S MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE.

04:22.629 --> 04:27.067
>> IT'S PRONOUNCED GUNS.
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN USING
THIS FAKE DISEASE TO STRIP US OF

04:27.067 --> 04:35.408
OUR FREEDOMS.
DO THEY THINK WE'RE DUMB?
>> PLEASE.

04:35.408 --> 04:40.980
WOULD THEY GIVE A DUMB PERSON A
GUN?
>> YES.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.716
>> FIRST, THEY SAID THE
SHUTDOWNS WERE UNTIL THEY FOUND
A VACCINE.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.818
THEN THEY FOUND A VACCINE AND
SAID IT WORKED.
THEN THEY SAID EVERYONE SHOULD

04:44.818 --> 04:50.290
GET IT.
THEN PEOPLE GOT IT AND IT SAVED
THEIR LIVES.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.127
IF THAT'S NOT COMMUNISM, THEN
HONEY, I MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT
COMMUNISM IS.

04:54.127 --> 04:58.465
>> SO MERRY CHRISTMAS, AND
REMEMBER, GUNS DON'T KILL
PEOPLE.

04:58.465 --> 05:05.305
PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE.
>> NO HELPING.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, LOOK --

05:05.305 --> 05:10.043
IT'S THE TRUTH, GUYS, WE'RE
STILL IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE

05:10.043 --> 05:12.846
JUST BECAUSE WE ALL WISH IT
WOULD GO AWAY.
>> OH, DID SOMEBODY SAY "WISH IT

05:12.846 --> 05:29.929
WOULD GO AWAY"?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.698
THE WEIRDO WITH THE BEARDO,
TED CRUZ.
>> TED, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:31.698 --> 05:36.403
>> WELL HEY, IF YOU'RE SICK OF
SEEING ME, IMAGINE HOW SICK I AM
OF BEING ME.

05:36.403 --> 05:45.645
>> SENATOR CRUZ, HOW ARE YOU
HANDLING THE PANDEMIC?
>> WELL, TEXTBOOK BAD.

05:45.645 --> 05:50.583
YOU KNOW, I WAS THE ONE NOT
WEARING A MASK AT
BOB DOLE'S FUNERAL.

05:50.583 --> 05:54.621
NOW YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN I RAN
FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016, BOB DOLE
SAID NOBODY LIKES ME, AND THIS

05:54.621 --> 06:02.028
WEEK I GOT HIM BACK NOT BY BEING
INFECTIOUS, BUT JUST IMAGINE
LOOKING DOWN AT YOUR OWN

06:02.028 --> 06:09.803
FUNERAL, AND THE ONLY FACE YOU
CAN SEE IS MINE.
>> THAT'S VERY DISTURBING.

06:09.803 --> 06:15.542
BUT, WELL, I THINK WE ALL
LEARNED A LOT TODAY.
CLEARLY THIS COUNTRY IS DIVIDED,

06:15.542 --> 06:18.278
BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON
AT LEAST A FEW THINGS.
WE ALL WANT TO SPEND TIME

06:18.278 --> 06:24.951
TOGETHER WITH OUR FAMILIES.
>> OR RUN IT BACK SOLO TO
CANCUN.

06:24.951 --> 06:30.223
>> WE ALL WANT OUR LOVED ONES TO
BE SAFE AND HAPPY AND HEALTHY.
>> 'CAUSE FAMILY IS ALL WE HAVE.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.460
>> YEAH.
AS OF TWO WEEKS AGO.
>> NOW THAT'S THE CHRISTMAS

06:33.460 --> 06:38.064
SPIRIT.
SEE, WE ALREADY FOUND SOME
COMMON GROUND.

06:38.064 --> 06:42.736
>> AND WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE
FOX NEWS CHRISTMAS TREE
ARSONISTS MUST BE EXECUTED.

06:42.736 --> 06:49.376
>> MAYBE NOT.
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK IT'S
"SATURDAY NIGHT!"

08:46.726 --> 08:55.101
HOST AND MUSICAL GUEST
BILLIE EILISH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

08:55.101 --> 09:24.464
BILLIE EILISH!
>>> OH, MY GOD!
THANK YOU GUYS.

09:24.464 --> 09:28.702
HI!
HOW YOU DOING?
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

09:28.702 --> 09:36.810
MY NAME IS BILLIE EILISH.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> THANK YOU.

09:36.810 --> 09:44.851
IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME FROM MY
MUSIC, YOU MAY KNOW ME FROM MY
HAIR OR MY CLOTHES.

09:44.851 --> 09:48.388
THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO DRESS
LIKE MRS. CLAUS GOING TO THE
CLUB.

09:48.388 --> 09:52.359
BUT ACTUALLY, NO, I AM ONLY
WEARS THIS
BECAUSE AFTER THE SHOW I GOT TO

09:52.359 --> 09:57.297
GO GET MARRIED IN AN ANIME.
SOME PEOPLE WONDER WHY I STARTED
WEARING BAGGY CLOTHES.

09:57.297 --> 10:03.970
THERE WAS ACTUALLY A GOOD
REASON.
SO IT WASN'T JUST FOR COMFORT OR

10:03.970 --> 10:09.409
FOR STYLE.
THIS IS HARD TO SAY FOR ME, BUT
THE

10:09.409 --> 10:11.644
REAL REASON I WORE BIG OVERSIZE
CLOTHES BACK THEN IS I WAS
ACTUALLY TWO KIDS STACKED ON TOP

10:11.644 --> 10:23.189
OF EACH OTHER TRYING TO SNEAK
INTO A R-RATED MOVIE.
IT IS SO, SO GREAT TO BE BACK

10:23.189 --> 10:24.624
HERE AT
"SNL."
I WAS THE MUSICAL GUEST A COUPLE

10:24.624 --> 10:29.863
YEARS AGO, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT I WOULD HOST.
EVER.

10:29.863 --> 10:34.300
IN FACT, I USED TO SAY THAT I
HATED ACTING, BUT THE TRUTH IS
WHEN I WAS LITTLE I LOVED IT.

10:34.300 --> 10:40.273
MY MOM AND DAD WERE BOTH ACTORS.
SO IS MY BROTHER, FINNEAS.
AND IT WAS MY DREAM TO BE IN A

10:40.273 --> 10:44.244
MOVIE.
AND I REMEMBER WHEN THAT DREAM
DIED.

10:44.244 --> 10:51.251
YEAH.
I WAS 9.
OKAY?

10:51.251 --> 10:55.288
AND MY MOM -- MY MOM
WROTE A FILM INSPIRED BY HER
LIFE.

10:55.288 --> 11:03.963
THIS IS TRUE.
SHE CAST MY BROTHER, FINNEAS, AS
HER SON.

11:03.963 --> 11:16.076
SHE PLAYED THE MOM.
AND IN THE MOVIE, SHE HAD NO
DAUGHTER.

11:16.076 --> 11:21.948
TRUE STORY.
YEAH, I GOT THE HINT FROM THAT.
JUST KIDDING.

11:21.948 --> 11:27.187
MY MOM IS MY BEST FRIEND.
SHE'S HERE.
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T LIVE

11:27.187 --> 11:35.462
FINNEAS MORE THAN ME.
>> I LOVE YOU, HONEY.
>> OKAY.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.332
OKAY.
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> IT REALLY HAPPENED.

11:39.332 --> 11:43.503
IT IS SO SPECIAL TO BE HOSTING
IN DECEMBER.
NOT ONLY DO I LOVE CHRISTMAS AND

11:43.503 --> 11:48.208
OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
HERE AT CHRISTMAS.
NOT ONLY DO I LOVE CHRISTMAS,

11:48.208 --> 11:53.580
BUT MY BIRTHDAY IS ONE WEEK FROM
TODAY.
[ APPLAUSE ]

11:53.580 --> 11:57.584
I'M TURNING 20, OR AS THE
INTERNET CALLS THAT,
MIDDLE-AGED.

11:57.584 --> 12:03.723
BUT I AM ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED
TO GET OLDER BECAUSE I AM JUST
NOW STARTING TO UNDERSTAND WHO I

12:03.723 --> 12:08.461
ACTUALLY AM AS A PERSON.
AND THE SCARY THING ABOUT
GROWING UP IN THE PUBLIC EYE IS

12:08.461 --> 12:15.201
PEOPLE JUST DECIDE THAT
EVERYTHING YOU SAY AND DO AND
LOOK LIKE IS WHO YOU ARE

12:15.201 --> 12:16.836
FOREVER.
THAT'S NOT FAIR!
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE JUDGED BY

12:16.836 --> 12:25.078
THE WAY YOU PRESENTED YOURSELF
WHEN YOU WERE 16?
NO.

12:25.078 --> 12:36.189
IMAGINE BEING, SAY, COLIN JOST,
AND THE FIRST THING THAT COMES
UP WHEN YOU GOOGLE YOURSELF IS

12:36.189 --> 12:45.965
16-YORE-OLD COLIN JOST.
YIKES.
SEEN HERE WATCHING OTHER PEOPLE

12:45.965 --> 12:52.539
GO TO PROM.
BUT THE POINT IS, IT TAKES TIME
AND EFFORT TO ACCEPT WHO YOU

12:52.539 --> 12:57.110
REALLY ARE.
YOU'LL BE SO HAPPY THAT YOU DID.
I SPENT A LOT OF YEARS

12:57.110 --> 13:03.817
PRETENDING TO BE SOMEBODY THAT
I'M NOT, BASICALLY ACTING.
AND SOMEBODY WISE ONCE TOLD ME,

13:03.817 --> 13:10.156
"BILLIE, YOU SHOULD NEVER ACT,
THAT PERSON WAS MY MOM.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

13:10.156 --> 13:13.059
TONIGHT.
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

13:27.407 --> 13:33.646
>>> HEY, SWEETIE, HOW WAS WORK?
>> OH, INCREDIBLE.
INCREDIBLE.

13:33.646 --> 13:38.084
WE HAD A GREAT MEETING ABOUT
SOME EXCITING EMERGING MARKETS
WITH GROWTH POTENTIAL.

13:38.084 --> 13:47.193
YOU WANT TO HEAR THE DEETS?
NO THANKS.
BUT LOOK AT WHAT I DID.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.195
I PUT UP ALL THE CHRISTMAS CARDS
ON THE FRIDGE.
LOOKS FESTIVE, RIGHT?

13:49.195 --> 13:51.264
>> YEAH.
WOW, WE GOT A LOT OF CARDS THIS
YEAR.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.900
MAN, WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE,
HUH?
>> PEOPLE LIKE ME, YOUR SUPER

13:53.900 --> 13:58.371
WHITE, SUPER CHRISTIAN NEIGHBOR
HERE ON T
BEACH WITH MY PRETTY YET

13:58.371 --> 14:01.074
ANNOYING WIFE AND OUR ARMY OF
BLOND CHILDREN IN MATCHING WHITE
SHIRTS AND JEANS.

14:01.074 --> 14:06.279
>> AND YES, THIS IS THE SEVENTH
CHRISTMAS CARD IN A ROW I'VE
BEEN PREGNANT.

14:06.279 --> 14:14.087
I'M NEVER NOT PREGNANT.
>> DID SOMEONE USE THE WORDS
PREGNANT?

14:14.087 --> 14:22.796
BECAUSE I AM TOO.
I'M YOUR COUSIN WHOSE MADE
PREGNANCY MY ENTIRE PERSONALITY.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.698
I STARTED PLANNING THIS
CHRISTMAS CARD AS I WAS PEEING
ON THE PREGNANCY TEST.

14:24.698 --> 14:29.903
>> AND I'M THE HUSBAND WHOSE
NAME YOU WILL NEVER LEARN.
AS YOU CAN SEE MY EYES, I'M NOT

14:29.903 --> 14:35.141
AS INTO THIS CARD CONCEPT AS SHE
IS.
BUT I WASN'T GIVEN A CHOICE.

14:35.141 --> 14:42.882
>> SPEAKING OF COUSINS, I'M YOUR
COUSIN FROM WISCONSIN.
MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM ME AND THIS

14:42.882 --> 14:49.389
ANIMAL I KILLED.
MAN, EVERYBODY LOOKS SO HAPPY.
BUT I DON'T RECOGNIZE HER,

14:49.389 --> 14:51.091
THOUGH.
>> HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM
DR. DONNA WOODS OF SMILE TIME

14:51.091 --> 14:57.163
DENTAL PARTNERS.
YOU ARE TWO YEARS LATE FOR YOUR
SIX-MONTH CLEANING.

14:57.163 --> 15:01.835
>> I'LL GO WHEN COVID'S OVER.
OH, DID YOU SEE PIERCE AND
LEONARD'S CARDS?

15:01.835 --> 15:05.038
>> OF COURSE HE DID.
IT'S STUNNING.
>> STUNNING.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.807
>> WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT
FROM THE WELL-OFF MIDDLE-AGED
GAY COUPLE YOUR WIFE IS FRIENDS

15:07.807 --> 15:13.580
WITH?
AS USUAL, WE'RE DRESSED TO THE
NINES AND HOLDING OUR OLD, GROSS

15:13.580 --> 15:24.357
LITTLE DOG THAT YOU CANNOT
BELIEVE IS STILL ALIVE.
>> OH, MY --

15:24.357 --> 15:25.925
OH, MY GOD.
THAT RAT OF THEIRS IS STILL
ALIVE?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.061
HOW?
>> SIMPLE.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

15:28.061 --> 15:37.971
IN MEDICAL PROCEDURES.
THAT'S HOW ALL OF WHICH THE VET
PREFACED WITH.

15:37.971 --> 15:42.442
I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE GAINING,
TWO, THREE MONTHS AT THE MOST.
>> WAIT, IS THAT YOUR FRIEND

15:42.442 --> 15:49.249
RUTH WITH MILEY CYRUS?
ARE THEY FRIENDS?
>> NO --

15:49.249 --> 15:52.419
NO, WE ARE NOT, BUT WHAT BETTER
WAY TO REMIND YOU THAT I MET A
CELEBRITY AT A RESTAURANT

15:52.419 --> 15:58.158
11 MONTHS AGO THAN WITH MY
CHRISTMAS CARD?
>> THIS WOMAN CAME UP TO MY

15:58.158 --> 16:01.528
TABLE AND SAID, "YOU'RE
HANNAH MONTANA."
AND THEN SHE SAID THAT SHE HATED

16:01.528 --> 16:06.032
MY MUSIC.
>> I WAS JUST BEING HONEST.
IT'S NOT FOR ME.

16:06.032 --> 16:10.704
>> SHE ASKED FOR A PHOTO AND
IMPLIED IF I DIDN'T TAKE IT, IT
WAS BECAUSE I WAS BEING RACIST.

16:10.704 --> 16:18.745
>> THAT'S TRUE.
I USE THAT A LOT.
>> SO, I TOOK THE PICTURE.

16:18.745 --> 16:26.720
SO I GUESS MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM
MILEY AND --
>> YOU DON'T KNOW MY NAME?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.689
YOU RACIST!
>> MAN, RUTH IS SO COOL.
SHE'S FRIENDS WITH FAMOUS

16:29.689 --> 16:31.691
PEOPLE.
>> BY THE WAY, WHO'S
BARBARA JACOBS AGAIN?

16:31.691 --> 16:37.964
>> OH, THAT'S ONE OF MY MOM'S
FRIENDS.
>> HAPPY HOLIDAYS FROM ME, YOUR

16:37.964 --> 16:42.168
MOM'S SINGLE FRIEND WHO HAS
LOOKED 52 YEARS OLD SINCE YOU
WERE A BABY.

16:42.168 --> 16:46.373
YOU KNOW, THE DRILL.
EVERY YEAR MY CHRISTMAS CARD HAS
A PICTURE OF ME, ALONE, ON A

16:46.373 --> 16:52.112
CRAZY-ASS VACATION.
LAST YEAR, I WAS ON TOP OF A
MOUNTAIN.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.782
THIS YEAR, I'M SNORKELING OFF
THE COAST OF A VOLCANO.
WHAT'S MY DEAL?

16:55.782 --> 17:00.020
AM I A LESBIAN?
A WEALTHY WIDOW?
YOU DON'T CARE ENOUGH TO ASK

17:00.020 --> 17:08.328
YOUR MOM, SO YOU'LL NEVER KNOW!
>> WAIT, WHO'S THAT IN THE
PAJAMAS?

17:08.328 --> 17:12.532
>> THAT'S HARPER.
WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER.
>> WERE YOU GUYS FRIENDS?

17:12.532 --> 17:17.404
>> YEAH.
>> NO WE WEREN'T.
AND I MADE HER LIFE A LIVING

17:17.404 --> 17:25.178
HELL.
WHAT'S NEW WITH ME?
LET'S SEE.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.080
STILL A [ BLEEP ].
STILL RICHER THAN HER AND STILL
MARRIED TO MY HANDSOME YET

17:27.080 --> 17:35.188
BORING HUSBAND WHO CHEATS ON ME.
>> I DO CHEAT ON HER, A LOT.
>> WHAT ELSE?

17:35.188 --> 17:42.495
OH, MY SON IS 15 NOW.
HE'S GROWING INTO A FINE YOUNG
INCEL.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.597
>> IT'S GIRLS' FAULTS THAT I'M
NOT COOL.
>> AND IF OUR MATCHING PAJAMAS

17:44.597 --> 17:46.833
DON'T MAKE YOU HATE US, FLIP THE
CARD OVER FOR A LONG BRAGGY LIST
OF WHAT OUR FAMILY DID THIS

17:46.833 --> 17:56.509
YEAR.
>> SPOILER ALERT, WE MOVED INTO
A HUGE HOUSE ON THE LAKE.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.978
>> I DON'T LIKE THE LAKE BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO WEAR SWIM TRUNKS.
AND I'M AT THE PART OF PUBERTY

17:58.978 --> 18:02.649
WHERE I LOOK LIKE A NEWBORN

DISEASE, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, OR

41:52.912 --> 41:55.115
YOU GREW UP DRINKING FROM A
SEGREGATED WATER FOUNTAIN, MAN.
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY MY UNCLE

I DIDN'T RAISE YOU LIKE THAT.

43:19.733 --> 43:25.572
