00:04.738 --> 00:07.173
Miss Bliss,
what does "psychopath" mean?

00:07.440 --> 00:08.541
Why?

00:08.575 --> 00:10.377
Well,
so far it's the nicest thing

00:10.410 --> 00:12.212
anyone's said
about the new kid.

00:12.245 --> 00:13.413
( kids laughing )

00:13.446 --> 00:17.450
At his last school,
he was voted
most likely to draw blood.

00:17.484 --> 00:21.621
What school was that?
Saint Freddy's on Elm Street?

00:21.654 --> 00:25.291
Class, I ask you,
is it fair to judge someone

00:25.325 --> 00:27.560
before you've even met them?

00:29.262 --> 00:31.731
( kids murmuring assent )

00:31.765 --> 00:33.366
( bell rings )

00:33.400 --> 00:36.703
<i>* When I wake up in</i>
<i>the morning and the</i>
<i>alarm gives out a warning</i>

00:36.736 --> 00:39.706
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:39.739 --> 00:42.742
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:42.776 --> 00:46.146
<i>* I'm at</i>
<i>the corner just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:46.179 --> 00:50.250
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.285 --> 00:55.155
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:55.188 --> 00:57.857
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:57.891 --> 01:01.061
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:01.094 --> 01:04.497
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

01:04.531 --> 01:08.468
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:26.119
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:26.152 --> 01:29.122
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:29.155 --> 01:32.759
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:39.532 --> 01:42.669
Carrie:
<i>I can't help feeling sorry</i>
<i>for the new kid in school.</i>

01:42.702 --> 01:46.172
<i>Everybody already</i>
<i>knows each other,</i>
<i>and the only thing he can do</i>

01:46.206 --> 01:48.141
<i>is try his best to fit in.</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:50.110
( wood snapping )

01:50.110 --> 01:54.347
<i>And each student has his own</i>
<i>special way of doing that.</i>

01:55.882 --> 02:00.620
All right.
Pencils down,
papers forward, please.

02:00.653 --> 02:04.324
And before I forget,
I want to
congratulate the only

02:04.357 --> 02:08.461
member of class to
get a perfect 100
on yesterday's quiz.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.729
What can I say?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.765
How about nothing,
for a change.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.467
Samuel Powers.

02:16.636 --> 02:20.140
All right, now I've left a few
moments at
the end of class today,

02:20.173 --> 02:23.309
so that we can
become acquainted
with our newest arrival.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.445
Deke?

02:25.478 --> 02:28.381
Would you stand up and tell us
a little bit about yourself?

02:31.618 --> 02:33.753
My name is Deke.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.324
Well, I did say a little bit.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.927
( bell rings )

02:41.695 --> 02:42.862
Carrie: Freeze!

02:42.896 --> 02:46.332
For your homework tomorrow,
I want one page

02:46.366 --> 02:47.834
on the Battle of
Little Bighorn.

02:47.867 --> 02:50.203
One page? No problem.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.305
Zack.
I expect a page of writing.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.341
Not a picture
of General Custer

02:54.374 --> 02:55.742
with an arrow through it.

02:58.244 --> 03:01.214
Deke. How did you
do on the quiz today?

03:04.584 --> 03:08.355
Yes, well, don't worry.
You won't be graded on it.

03:08.388 --> 03:12.592
It's just to give me an idea
of what you learned
at your last school.

03:12.625 --> 03:13.860
Is this your paper?

03:13.893 --> 03:15.462
Does it say "Deke" on it?

03:15.495 --> 03:16.329
Yes.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.531
Are there any other
Dekes in your class?

03:19.366 --> 03:20.400
No.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.634
Then it must be me.

03:21.668 --> 03:24.204
Anything else?

03:24.237 --> 03:28.842
Yes. Why did you answer only
one question on
your quiz paper?

03:29.609 --> 03:31.411
It's the only one I liked.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.748
Do you expect me
to believe that?

03:34.781 --> 03:36.883
I don't expect
anything from anyone.

03:40.286 --> 03:41.588
You may go now, Deke.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.892
Okay, everybody.
Dress rehearsal.

03:45.925 --> 03:49.596
 Act 1, Scene 1.
<i>The Forest Ranger.</i>

03:49.629 --> 03:52.365
Written by Nikki Coleman,

03:52.399 --> 03:56.269
and starring Lisa
Turtle as the forest ranger.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.271
Lisa: Ready.

03:58.304 --> 04:00.273
And curtain!

04:00.840 --> 04:02.275
Hold it!

04:02.308 --> 04:04.210
And cut!

04:04.244 --> 04:05.345
Lisa, what are you doing?

04:05.378 --> 04:06.613
I'm acting.

04:06.646 --> 04:11.518
Acting like a fool!
Forest rangers do
not wear evening gowns.

04:11.551 --> 04:15.455
I visualize my
character as a forest ranger
in downtown Manhattan.

04:16.488 --> 04:20.226
You're missing
the entire point of my play.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.463
Miss Paladrino,
I guess this means
I get detention, right?

04:23.496 --> 04:25.498
But you haven't
done anything wrong.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.400
I'm about to.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.501
Come back here!

04:29.903 --> 04:32.238
Tina, can I have
a word with you, please?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.607
Sure.
I'll be back in a minute.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.544
What's up?

04:37.577 --> 04:40.380
Deke Simmons.
Do you have him in class?

04:40.413 --> 04:43.083
Mmm-hmm.
In fact, I got
an apple from him on my desk.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.685
Deke brought you an apple?

04:45.719 --> 04:48.088
Well,
he didn't exactly bring it.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.358
It landed there
after it bounced
off Tommy Kramer's head.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.566
Mr. Belding,
I need to talk to you.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.368
If it's about Deke,
take a number.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.637
You know, Mr. Belding,
I think there's
something wrong here.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.806
Maybe if I took
a look at Deke's records.

05:06.840 --> 05:11.444
Be my guest.
Miss Bliss,
I've looked at his records.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.347
After the first hundred pages,
it gets repetitious.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.283
Well, I think his problems
run deeper than grades.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.953
All right, he seems to have an
attitude problem,
but just maybe

05:20.053 --> 05:22.622
in a new school environment,
things will change.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.526
Well, according to this,
he's had eight
new school environments

05:26.559 --> 05:27.961
in the last two years.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.931
Yes, but the ninth
could be his lucky charm.
Just call me Mr. Optimistic!

05:32.732 --> 05:34.300
Mr. Belding...

05:34.334 --> 05:35.902
I know Deke has problems.

05:35.935 --> 05:39.305
Miss Bliss,
you have a way with kids,
that's why I put him with you.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.542
I'm sure you've
made a big difference
in his life already.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.444
If you need
someone to show you

05:44.477 --> 05:46.379
around the school,
I'd be happy to.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.314
I could show you
the lunch bar...

05:48.348 --> 05:49.449
Shut up.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.850
Or I could do that.

05:50.884 --> 05:55.588
Um, do you mind lowering me?
I need some oxygen.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.827
( coughs )

06:00.860 --> 06:03.863
At every new school I go to,
I pick someone
out to team up with

06:03.897 --> 06:05.865
in the homework department.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.767
You do it, I hand it in.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.903
Oh, kind of a 50/50 thing.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.439
Exactly.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.841
And don't forget to
disguise the handwriting.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.844
You wouldn't want me getting
in any trouble, would you?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.881
( stammering ) No,
but I'm not really
that great a student,

06:21.915 --> 06:25.952
so if you want to
pick someone else,
I wouldn't be offended.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.723
You got 100 on
that quiz, didn't you?

06:29.756 --> 06:34.661
Just a lot of lucky guesses.
Haven't you ever
gotten 100 on a quiz?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.463
No.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.531
I knew that was coming.

06:43.069 --> 06:47.273
All right, everybody,
here are your
papers on Little Bighorn.

06:47.307 --> 06:50.143
Miss Bliss,
did you like the part
I wrote about Sitting Bull?

06:50.176 --> 06:52.645
I'm looking at
Sitting Bull right now.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.816
Deke, you're late.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.785
Yep.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.889
I'm confused,
I thought you spelled
your name D-E-K-E.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.024
I do.

07:04.057 --> 07:08.628
Oh, that's odd.
On your paper,
you spelled it D-E-E-K.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.597
( kids laughing )

07:11.297 --> 07:13.233
Typographical error.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.041
Uh, class, I'm putting today's
assignment on the board.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.612
What is this?

07:25.645 --> 07:30.116
That's the paper I...
Uh, you wrote.

07:31.317 --> 07:33.053
D-plus?

07:33.086 --> 07:35.822
If I wanted a D,
I would have done it myself.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.224
Look,
I can't write under pressure.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.794
Ask around.
Choke's my middle name.

07:43.263 --> 07:47.100
Look, I got a D-minus.
Does that make
you feel any better?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.235
You know what would
make me feel better?

07:49.269 --> 07:52.105
Erasing the lines on
the basketball court.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.707
With your face.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.210
Have you
considered counseling?

08:00.046 --> 08:03.683
Screech, you're
talking to your French fries.
What's wrong?

08:04.684 --> 08:07.520
Deke Simmons is making me
do his homework.

08:07.554 --> 08:12.225
If it isn't great,
he's gonna slam-dunk my head.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.929
Wow. What are you gonna do?

08:16.029 --> 08:18.565
I don't know,
but I gotta do something.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.235
My face ain't much,
but I'm kind of
attached to it.

08:22.268 --> 08:26.606
Look,
if Deke wants you bad enough,
he'll find you.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.875
The trick is to
make him not want to.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.110
Could you do that?

08:31.144 --> 08:32.312
What's in it for me?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.581
I'd be alive.
Isn't that enough?

08:34.614 --> 08:36.149
Not really.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.350
I'll be your best friend.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.121
And I'll give you 10 bucks!

08:41.154 --> 08:43.923
Okay,
but only 'cause we're pals.

08:45.725 --> 08:51.131
Whoa! Stop it! Kill it! 86 it!
You are not
planting trees on my stage.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.167
We're not planting them, Mylo.
We're nailing them.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.068
That's worse!

08:55.101 --> 08:57.904
Wood and nails come
under my jurisdiction.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.340
And on my stage,
the two don't mix.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.310
Your stage!
I am the drama teacher.
This is my stage!

09:04.344 --> 09:06.212
( scoffs ) I was here
when they laid it down,

09:06.246 --> 09:08.114
plank by plank,
board by board.

09:08.148 --> 09:13.219
It's sort of
like a child to me.
I even named it Woody.

09:13.253 --> 09:17.724
This is a stage,
the show must go on,
and Woody's getting nailed!

09:17.757 --> 09:19.192
Over my dead body!

09:20.160 --> 09:22.595
What's going on
here with you two?

09:22.629 --> 09:25.298
He won't let me put
my trees on Woody.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.366
Woody?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.934
( both talking
simultaneously )

09:28.034 --> 09:31.271
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it!

09:31.304 --> 09:34.741
Now, I don't know
what the big problem is,

09:34.774 --> 09:38.778
but it seems to
me the appropriate
word here is compromise.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.815
I can go along with that.

09:41.848 --> 09:47.387
I got it. Why don't
you take <i>Forest Ranger</i>
and redo it as <i>Desert Ranger.</i>

09:48.154 --> 09:50.123
<i>Desert Ranger?</i>

09:50.156 --> 09:52.826
Sure. You don't have to
nail sand to the floor.

09:53.827 --> 09:58.365
Fine. I'll use sand.
But I'll glue it on!

09:58.398 --> 10:01.101
Glue!
No way! Hey, wait a minute!

10:02.836 --> 10:04.671
Glad I could be of help.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.309
You changed everything!
You ruined my play.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.811
No, I didn't.
I made it better.

10:11.845 --> 10:16.116
Miss Bliss? Could you help us?
We're having
creative differences.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.184
Yeah,
I'm creative and she isn't.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.819
You're so self-centered!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.021
Are, too!

10:21.054 --> 10:25.725
Girls. Girls!
There seems to be
an epidemic going around.

10:25.759 --> 10:30.063
And the cure is compromise.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.865
You know,
I could go with that.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.466
Nikki, you should be
in the play with me.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.734
Really?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.403
Yeah, I think you
should play a stump.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.939
I think compromise
with Lisa is impossible.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.274
You want to talk
about impossible?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.742
Let's talk about
how impossible it is

10:42.776 --> 10:44.244
to act in your boring play.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.282
Well, I'm two for two.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.154
Deke! Uh, Mr. Simmons.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.923
Get lost.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.259
I think we should talk.
It's about Screech.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.062
You know,
that little wimpy guy
who does your homework?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.229
Right.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.298
Ah, never mind.
You can handle him.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.734
Never mind what?

11:07.767 --> 11:11.237
Well, Screech may
not look like much,
but believe it or not,

11:11.271 --> 11:14.140
he's a frail,
male fighting machine.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.775
We talking about the same guy?

11:15.809 --> 11:19.379
Hey, you betcha.
He knows all those
self-defense things.

11:19.412 --> 11:23.116
Like kung fu,
jujitsu, Mitsubishi!

11:24.784 --> 11:26.286
Why are you telling me this?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.321
Well, I've seen him
beat up so many people,

11:28.355 --> 11:30.757
I want the violence to stop.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.159
Thanks a lot.
Made a big difference.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.561
Hey, glad I could help.

11:34.594 --> 11:38.098
You did. See,
I let that little twerp off,
'cause I felt sorry for him.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.499
But since I know
he can fight back,

11:39.532 --> 11:41.101
I'm gonna take
him out right now.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.405
Screech: Psst! Psst!

11:46.006 --> 11:47.440
How did it go?

11:47.474 --> 11:50.510
Well, the good news is,
I'm not charging you that $10.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.178
Thanks, Zack!

11:52.212 --> 11:55.115
And I've got good news
for your brother, too.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.417
You know how he always wanted
to have his own room?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.096
Hey, Zack,
any luck finding Screech?

12:10.463 --> 12:11.831
Nope.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.166
Nobody's seen him since lunch.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.236
Yeah, rumor has it
he's halfway to Guam.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.172
Can't take it anymore.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.807
How long have
you been in there?

12:20.840 --> 12:25.245
I'm not sure.
I think I passed out
sometime last period.

12:25.278 --> 12:29.082
I got some advice.
When Deke hits you,
fall on a fat kid.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.818
Yeah, look on the bright side,
when you're unconscious,

12:31.851 --> 12:33.219
you can't feel pain!

12:33.253 --> 12:35.155
Don't try to
cheer me up, Zack.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.224
You!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.827
If I were you right now,
I'd be running.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.829
If you were me
right now, I'd be happy.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.164
Let's get on with it.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.833
All: Mr. Belding!

12:46.866 --> 12:47.701
Hi, kids.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.872
I'm gonna knock you
into next semester.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.275
Take your hands
off him, right now.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.312
Get into my classroom.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.414
You can't hide behind
your teacher's skirt forever.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.216
That's enough.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.954
All right, school's over.
Go home.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.823
Unless you'd like
to spend quality time

13:09.856 --> 13:11.458
with Mr.
Burton in detention hall.

13:14.260 --> 13:18.231
Samuel, Samuel.
Are you all right?

13:18.264 --> 13:22.836
( sighs ) No,
I'm not all right.
Why did you have to stop it?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.304
You made me look like a wimp.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.438
He was going to hurt you.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.209
So? The school nurse says
I have terrific clotting time.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.144
Samuel, you can't be serious?

13:31.177 --> 13:34.948
Sure I can.
At least if I were dead,
I could live with myself.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.694
How dare you
threaten another student?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.596
Why don't you
just leave me alone?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.564
You've been on my case
ever since I got here.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.535
Deke. Believe it or not,
I'm not the enemy.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.270
Yeah, and I bet
the next thing you're

13:57.303 --> 13:59.205
gonna say is that you
really want to help me.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.608
I take it you've
heard that speech before?

14:01.641 --> 14:03.443
You take it right.

14:03.476 --> 14:07.380
Oh, and so the way you deal
with your problems is
that you hit people.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.283
Works for me.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.252
Well, it didn't work
for me when you only

14:12.285 --> 14:14.120
answered one
question on your quiz.

14:14.154 --> 14:17.223
And it didn't work for me
when you misspelled your name.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.192
Hey, so I'm not gifted.

14:19.225 --> 14:23.530
I want you to do
an extra credit report
on one of our presidents.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.599
Choose from this list.
Pick one.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.604
Abraham Lincoln.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.839
He's not on the list.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.577
George Washington.

14:37.610 --> 14:38.812
He's not on there, either.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.514
No.mas Jefferson.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
Then who is on
the stupid list?

14:44.884 --> 14:49.255
Uncle Ben,
Betty Crocker and Sara Lee.
It's my shopping list.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.493
You can't read, can you?

14:53.526 --> 14:56.463
Well, you solved the puzzle.
Can I go now?

14:56.496 --> 14:57.731
Do your parents know?

14:57.764 --> 14:59.466
Who do you think
taught me not to read?

14:59.499 --> 15:00.834
And what about your teachers?

15:00.867 --> 15:01.568
Hey, look, I'm a troublemaker.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.236
Just give me
a passing grade and

15:03.269 --> 15:04.604
I'll become
someone else's problem.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.408
Deke, you're in my class now.
My students'
problems are my problems.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.676
No, I won't.f.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.745
You have to learn to read.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.681
I promise I'll do everything
in my power to help you.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.549
Yeah,
and while you're helping me,
everyone else will be

15:16.583 --> 15:18.218
laughing at me behind my back.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.552
Nobody will laugh.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.920
They always have before.

15:22.856 --> 15:26.793
Just forget it.
I'm gonna make it on my own.

15:26.826 --> 15:30.296
All right, Deke.
Yeah, sure. Maybe you will.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.867
Who knows?
You may be even,
one day, a big success.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.904
And someday,
someone might even
write the Deke Simmons story.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.606
But I wonder about one thing.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.275
Who's going to read it to you?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.351
I know what you're
going to say, Miss Bliss,

15:51.384 --> 15:53.820
but I've
already made inquiries
into having him transferred.

15:53.853 --> 15:57.223
Transferring isn't the answer.
That's what they
always do to him.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.392
Yes,
but no one's tried Siberia.

16:00.326 --> 16:03.396
Mr. Belding, Deke can't read.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.864
Well, if we send him there,
it won't matter,

16:04.898 --> 16:06.499
because they
don't speak English.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.337
Mr. Belding,
he really can't read!

16:10.370 --> 16:14.040
And he refuses to go to our
remedial education program.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.543
If he refuses to go,
our hands are tied.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.511
Well, I can't accept that.

16:18.545 --> 16:22.215
Deke needs help,
and I won't just
sit around and do nothing.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.218
Miss Bliss, in all my
years as a principal,
I never knew a teacher

16:25.251 --> 16:28.855
who was more loved than you.
But nobody can touch them all.

16:28.888 --> 16:32.525
Except, of course,
for poor Mr. Claymore,
who blew up the science lab.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.629
( doors slamming )

16:36.663 --> 16:39.366
If actors were
supposed to write,
they'd call them writers.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.535
To the actor,
the script is just a guide.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.604
Both:
Without me you're nothing!

16:45.071 --> 16:46.639
Both: Echo!

16:46.673 --> 16:48.875
Both: One, two,
three, four, five, you're it!

16:48.908 --> 16:51.544
( laughs ) You know
we haven't done that
since the fifth grade?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.614
Yeah, it's from the same
time as our last fight.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.883
Oh, yeah, I remember.
We both wanted

16:56.916 --> 16:59.619
to be the lead ribbon
in the Maypole dance.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.621
We swore we'd never
talk to each other again.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.824
Yeah, we stuck to it
for at least 20 minutes.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.291
It was murder.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.462
You still want to do the play?

17:09.496 --> 17:12.565
Yeah, but I have a suggestion.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.535
Get yourself another star.
I want to be the producer.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.039
I don't have time
to find a lawyer,

17:19.039 --> 17:21.040
so I'll just tell
you guys my will.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.944
Nikki, Lisa.
You can have my calculators.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.380
Mikey, you can have my stereo.

17:27.414 --> 17:31.051
Screech, you're talking crazy.
But who's
getting the speakers?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.388
Zack,
I saved the best for you.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.424
You can have my condo on Mars.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.958
I'm touched.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.462
But only if you're
willing to spread
my ashes over my fly farm.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.565
Screech,
nobody wants your stuff.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.600
Just go home
before Deke finds you.

17:47.634 --> 17:52.339
I want him to!
Deke! I want you!

17:53.640 --> 17:56.376
Let me get this straight.
Screech is looking for Deke?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.978
This is exactly what happened
in <i>West Side Story.</i>

17:59.079 --> 18:01.314
When Tony was
looking for Chino.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.849
What happened to him?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.617
I'm out of here.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.887
Deke! Come and get me!

18:07.921 --> 18:10.824
Someone take a picture of me
and give it to
the plastic surgeon.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.027
( boots stomping )

18:15.028 --> 18:17.364
You and me. Boys' room. Now.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.766
Wait a minute!

18:19.799 --> 18:22.035
( sighs ) Deke,
you're going to have to

18:22.068 --> 18:24.671
go through me to
get to Screech.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.039
Just you?

18:26.072 --> 18:28.675
No, the both of us.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.076
Me, too.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.050
No, guys. It's my fight.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.052
No! going for help.

18:39.753 --> 18:41.821
I need to do it this way.

18:42.856 --> 18:43.923
( sighs )

18:48.061 --> 18:50.063
( door slams )

18:50.063 --> 18:52.465
Do you know exactly
where his fly farm is?

18:54.601 --> 18:56.936
It's not very often
somebody looks for me.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.406
Yeah, well, I'd just
like to get this over with,

18:59.439 --> 19:02.709
so I can swing by the hospital
and still get home
in time for dinner.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.911
The hospital part
I can guarantee.

19:05.011 --> 19:08.481
Um, I hate to be a bother,
but I have this trick knee,

19:08.515 --> 19:11.718
and I had some
dental work done,
so if you could avoid

19:11.751 --> 19:14.854
these key areas,
I would appreciate it.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.757
Huh.
I've never beaten somebody up
with so many rules before.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.093
( laughs )

19:21.428 --> 19:23.329
You're weird.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.332
Oh, great, you're not
only gonna beat me up,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.068
you're going to insult me!

19:28.101 --> 19:30.837
What do you care?
You don't know what it's like

19:30.870 --> 19:32.672
to be laughed at all the time.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.507
What do you know?

19:34.541 --> 19:36.643
I know I wanna live to be 15.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.711
I get laughed at a lot.

19:37.744 --> 19:38.778
Yeah, right.

19:38.812 --> 19:40.480
No, I don't.lieve me?

19:40.513 --> 19:41.848
I can't read.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.752
How come you're not laughing?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.053
It's not funny.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.790
No,
no, you're messing this up.

19:50.824 --> 19:54.427
I tell you I
can't read, you laugh,
and then I beat you up.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.762
Look,
I'm not gonna laugh at you,

19:55.795 --> 19:57.063
but if you're
gonna beat me up,

19:57.063 --> 19:58.765
let's get it over with now.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.900
I don't wanna worry about you
the rest of my life.

20:05.105 --> 20:07.674
Forget it.
I don't wanna fight you.

20:11.011 --> 20:13.113
Now get out of here
before I change my mind!

20:13.146 --> 20:14.547
Goodbye!

20:19.819 --> 20:23.456
Oh! Deke. You startled me.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.891
Sorry.

20:24.924 --> 20:25.992
Pardon me?

20:26.026 --> 20:27.660
I'm sorry I scared you.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.597
I was just wondering, um...

20:32.665 --> 20:33.700
What?

20:34.267 --> 20:35.935
Uh, Deke!.

20:35.969 --> 20:38.171
Is there something
I can do for you?

20:38.204 --> 20:40.774
Do you still think
you could help me read?

20:40.807 --> 20:44.244
Yes. You've taken
the first step yourself.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.079
I have?

20:46.780 --> 20:48.081
You're here, aren't you?

20:51.051 --> 20:52.552
Let's go.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.291
( sighs )

20:58.324 --> 21:00.527
So there we were,
when he got down

21:00.560 --> 21:02.595
on his knees and
begged for mercy,

21:02.629 --> 21:06.132
and I said, "Deke, this time,
I'm letting you
off with a warning,

21:06.166 --> 21:09.202
"but don't ever
let me catch you
in this boys' room again."

21:10.070 --> 21:11.071
Boo.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.248
( instrumental music plays )
