WEBVTT

00:03.447 --> 00:05.533
Oh my God, what did I do...

00:05.658 --> 00:07.701
You married a Las
Vegas stripper.

00:09.036 --> 00:10.121
Congratulations.

00:10.496 --> 00:12.081
With Eric gone,

00:12.123 --> 00:13.749
you're the town dumbass!

00:14.875 --> 00:15.710
Steven,

00:15.835 --> 00:18.879
how could you get
married and not remember?

00:18.921 --> 00:19.922
It's not like

00:20.256 --> 00:24.301
forgetting where you left your
keys or where you parked your car

00:24.343 --> 00:26.512
or your tenth anniversary...

00:27.345 --> 00:29.180
I don't know what
happened, I mean,

00:29.221 --> 00:31.390
Samantha and I hung out
for three weeks, and then

00:31.432 --> 00:34.727
one night we got really drunk and I
remember waking up with a killer hangover,

00:34.769 --> 00:37.271
thinking I better get out of Vegas
before I'd do something stupid

00:38.898 --> 00:40.066
So close!

00:42.151 --> 00:44.320
Here are some
pictures of our wedding

00:45.821 --> 00:49.742
We found this beautiful little
chapel called "Weddings and Waffles".

00:50.831 --> 00:53.083
Wow, that must have
been some wedding.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.420
It's not too often that you see
the bride jump out of her own cake.

00:58.547 --> 01:00.424
Oh man, it's starting
to come back to me.

01:00.799 --> 01:03.218
I remember seeing a
cross and an altar.

01:03.302 --> 01:05.471
But I thought I was having
that Excorcist-dream again.

01:06.388 --> 01:08.265
WHERE'S THE STRIPPER?

01:09.266 --> 01:10.726
THERE SHE IS!

01:10.726 --> 01:13.187
THERE IS A STRIPPER
IN THE KITCHEN!

01:13.353 --> 01:15.564
AM I YELLING?
I CAN'T HELP IT!

01:16.231 --> 01:19.443
OOOOOOH HYDE YOU MARRIED A
STRIPPER I LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH

01:21.528 --> 01:24.490
You must be Kelso.
I'm Samantha Hyde

01:24.531 --> 01:26.575
Oh my God, you
took my name?!

01:27.576 --> 01:30.913
Oh Steven, you look like
you're about to throw up!

01:31.789 --> 01:32.706
Here,

01:32.956 --> 01:34.958
use Eric's 'whoopsie' basin.

01:35.876 --> 01:37.711
Aim for the Snoopy.

01:38.629 --> 01:41.048
I got the get out of here. I'm
gonna go to the record store.

01:41.089 --> 01:43.967
Well Hyde, you're
freakin' out man.

01:44.051 --> 01:47.221
You married a stripper!
You're living every guys dream!

01:47.888 --> 01:50.682
Well not my dream, my
dream is always the same,

01:50.724 --> 01:52.768
monkey gives me the finger

01:54.603 --> 01:56.563
and flaps his lips at me

01:57.231 --> 01:59.066
and takes off
with my clothes.

02:00.109 --> 02:01.944
Trust me, you don't
wanna live that dream.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.414 --> 02:16.708
What's the store doing closed
in the middle of the day?

02:16.959 --> 02:18.627
Maybe it's Rosh Hashanah.

02:28.428 --> 02:30.848
Hey dude, pull up a pillow.

02:32.558 --> 02:33.392
Leo,

02:33.767 --> 02:35.811
what the hell did you
do with my record store?

02:36.019 --> 02:37.229
Record store?

02:38.021 --> 02:42.025
You know now that you mention it, this
place would make an awesome record store.

03:21.582 --> 03:26.045
I left you in charge and you turned my store
into a hippy den for your stoner friends?!

03:26.837 --> 03:28.673
That's not true man.

03:28.714 --> 03:30.675
I don't know any
of these people.

03:34.553 --> 03:36.180
Leo, I'm not in the
mood for this today.

03:36.222 --> 03:38.849
Just get these people out of
here alright. I'll be in my office

03:41.269 --> 03:43.562
Leo there is an
ORGY in my office!

03:44.772 --> 03:47.900
I can't the boys from the
girls it's hair everywhere!

03:54.991 --> 03:55.783
Man.

03:55.992 --> 03:58.327
This is no way to
spend Rosh Hashanah.

04:04.584 --> 04:06.294
I can't believe Hyde.

04:06.752 --> 04:09.130
I mean he completely
broke Jackie's heart.

04:09.213 --> 04:11.799
Who just goes and
marries a stripper?

04:11.841 --> 04:13.092
What are you, dense?

04:15.219 --> 04:17.221
Anybody who can, that who.

04:19.265 --> 04:21.350
Okay, get dressed.
We're going out.

04:21.475 --> 04:25.771
But it doesn't really matter what you wear,
because everyone is gonna be looking at me.

04:26.439 --> 04:27.648
But don't wear that.

04:29.317 --> 04:30.276
Wow Jackie.

04:30.276 --> 04:33.654
After everything you've been through
with Hyde, you come here and insult me?!

04:34.030 --> 04:35.197
You're all better!

04:36.198 --> 04:38.242
Well I'm not gonna
sit around moping.

04:38.284 --> 04:40.870
I'm gonna do what every woman
does when they hit rock bottom.

04:40.912 --> 04:42.872
You're going to
have sex with me?!

04:44.916 --> 04:45.708
No.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.252
I'm going to go out
and meet some boys,

04:48.294 --> 04:50.630
and crush their
hearts one by one.

04:50.671 --> 04:54.383
You know Donna, Eric is in Africa.
Must be close to hitting rock bottom...

04:55.718 --> 04:56.594
Not really.

04:57.678 --> 05:01.390
How long has a boy have to wait before
one of floosies hits rock bottom?

05:09.398 --> 05:11.150
Oh. Samantha.

05:11.317 --> 05:13.736
You're painting your
toes in the kitchen.

05:15.112 --> 05:18.616
That's funny because I was just
making meatloaf in the bathroom.

05:20.284 --> 05:21.285
Sorry.

05:21.327 --> 05:24.080
Hyde told me how much
he likes painted toes.

05:24.372 --> 05:28.125
He told me some other things that he liked but
I said: Hey I'm a stripper not a contortionist.

05:28.918 --> 05:31.712
Well isn't that just more
then a mother wants to hear.

05:32.713 --> 05:34.257
Okay so,

05:34.507 --> 05:35.716
I'm curious.

05:35.883 --> 05:37.551
What is your act like?

05:37.593 --> 05:38.678
Do you sing?

05:38.719 --> 05:39.929
No I just dance.

05:39.929 --> 05:43.641
Oh. Well when I was younger,
I took tap. Do you do tap?

05:43.891 --> 05:46.852
No funny that you should
mention it, I strip to taps!

05:48.854 --> 05:49.772
You mean

05:50.398 --> 05:53.067
the song they play
when an army man dies?!

05:53.484 --> 05:54.277
Yeah.

05:54.610 --> 05:57.238
It's my tribute to
our armed forces.

05:57.822 --> 06:00.157
I wave the American flag

06:00.199 --> 06:03.119
and then for the big
finish, I give a salute

06:03.160 --> 06:04.829
and the I smack my fanny

06:08.916 --> 06:10.042
Sorry I...

06:10.084 --> 06:11.836
No I'm sorry.

06:11.877 --> 06:13.921
This thing has a
mind of it's own

06:15.798 --> 06:16.716
Red,

06:16.882 --> 06:20.720
I'm not sure how I feel about
having a stripper stay in our home.

06:21.053 --> 06:22.722
It's, what's the word,

06:22.763 --> 06:24.181
an abomination!

06:25.850 --> 06:28.728
I don't think Steven even knew what
he was doing when he married her.

06:28.728 --> 06:32.064
It sounds like he was as schnockered
as you were on St. Patricks Day.

06:32.398 --> 06:35.860
Okay well that green punch
sneaks right up on you!

06:37.111 --> 06:40.197
I think Steven has
made a huge mistake.

06:40.323 --> 06:41.782
But what are we gonna do?

06:41.866 --> 06:42.992
Kick Sam out?

06:42.992 --> 06:45.036
Oh we will do no such thing.

06:45.077 --> 06:46.078
You will!

06:47.622 --> 06:48.873
Oh fine.

06:49.081 --> 06:50.750
But the next time
you hit a deer,

06:50.791 --> 06:53.586
you're the one putting it out of
it's misery with it's tyre iron!

06:58.925 --> 07:00.051
Well well,

07:00.092 --> 07:04.847
another day in the life of Point Place police
officer. I just confiscated a whole box of lighters,

07:04.931 --> 07:07.224
paraphernalia and
illegal substances...

07:07.224 --> 07:08.768
ice work officer.

07:08.851 --> 07:11.062
Now we're hooked
up for two months.

07:12.855 --> 07:13.648
So...

07:14.732 --> 07:16.442
what do we do now...

07:16.776 --> 07:18.819
Man I think I
have to fire Leo.

07:19.195 --> 07:21.072
He almost put me
out of business.

07:21.781 --> 07:23.783
Just wish there was
a good way to do it...

07:26.619 --> 07:28.663
This is definitely gooder.

07:29.997 --> 07:30.831
Gooder?

07:31.958 --> 07:33.084
Yeah that's a word.

07:35.336 --> 07:36.212
Leo,

07:37.046 --> 07:39.966
I left you in charge of the
store and you let me down man.

07:40.258 --> 07:42.426
So I'm sorry to have to say

07:44.178 --> 07:45.638
you're fired man!

07:47.723 --> 07:50.726
I think the word you're
looking for is 'fried' man...

07:51.769 --> 07:52.979
And I am.

07:54.647 --> 07:56.774
No no man I mean
you're fired.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.194
That's even funnier man!

08:00.486 --> 08:02.405
And I totally deserve it.

08:03.531 --> 08:05.700
Yeah and you're
under arrest too!

08:06.492 --> 08:07.368
What?!

08:08.244 --> 08:11.414
I'm just kidding. These
handcuffs don't even work, look...

08:15.167 --> 08:17.628
wait, these are the
ones that DO work...

08:19.755 --> 08:22.592
Hey, I saw this Help
Wanted sign outside.

08:22.842 --> 08:24.051
You still looking?

08:25.052 --> 08:25.803
Errrrr,

08:26.971 --> 08:29.432
Leo were you trying
to hire somebody?

08:30.099 --> 08:33.977
You know yesterday I was having a
hard time opening up a jar of pickles

08:34.061 --> 08:35.980
so I put the Help
Wanted sign up.

08:36.688 --> 08:39.357
Too late man, I found
something else to eat.

08:43.486 --> 08:46.991
Why do they make the lid so
tight? It's just pickles!

08:48.159 --> 08:49.994
So you're not hiring?

08:50.244 --> 08:52.872
That's a bummer.
Cause I gotta say,

08:53.039 --> 08:55.166
if this is your idea
of a staff meeting,

08:55.374 --> 08:57.001
I'd work my butt off!

08:58.044 --> 09:00.588
What the hell man, I'm in
a giving mood right now.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.549
You can have the job and do all
the work that Leo wasn't doing.

09:03.674 --> 09:06.552
And Leo I can't fire you
man. You're too awesome.

09:06.677 --> 09:07.970
New guy, you're hired.

09:08.012 --> 09:10.306
Leo you're not fired,
jobs for everyone.

09:11.891 --> 09:13.935
Well that was hard
but it had to be done.

09:19.982 --> 09:22.109
Wow Jackie, that
is quite an outfit.

09:22.485 --> 09:24.028
Does it come with a pimp?

09:25.154 --> 09:27.573
Donna, this is my
man-catcher dress!

09:27.615 --> 09:29.909
It is scientifically
designed to make men want me,

09:29.951 --> 09:32.995
while at the same time knowing
they could never really have me.

09:33.621 --> 09:35.456
Oh everyone loves a tease...

09:37.625 --> 09:39.377
Oh he is cute and smiling!

09:39.794 --> 09:41.879
I'm gonna go and make
him wish he was dead!

09:45.132 --> 09:46.884
Can I ask you a question?

09:47.176 --> 09:49.011
Yes, I'm available.

09:50.054 --> 09:52.265
But not to you! HA! BURN!

09:52.348 --> 09:55.184
Oh my God that was so much
fun, I wanna do another one!

09:56.269 --> 09:58.896
Actually I just wanted to know
your hot blond friend's name...

09:58.938 --> 10:00.856
Oh I don't have a
hot blond friend.

10:01.399 --> 10:03.025
I'm just here
with Fez and Donna.

10:03.776 --> 10:04.777
Donna? Thanks!

10:04.819 --> 10:06.529
Wait, wait, what,
you like Donna?!

10:06.529 --> 10:08.447
She reads books for fun!

10:09.991 --> 10:11.242
Hi,

10:11.284 --> 10:12.368
I'm Mark.

10:12.702 --> 10:13.578
Wow,

10:13.828 --> 10:16.205
you have one of the prettiest
smiles I've ever seen.

10:16.247 --> 10:16.998
Oh

10:16.998 --> 10:18.457
thank you!

10:22.128 --> 10:24.839
Well the secret is to
brush with baking soda!

10:26.757 --> 10:28.676
Actually I was
talking to Donna.

10:28.718 --> 10:30.845
Wow, you are just gorgeous.

10:30.886 --> 10:32.555
Really?

10:32.722 --> 10:35.558
Yeah you know Donna
means 'lady' in Italian.

10:35.850 --> 10:38.144
And Belladonna means
'fine lady', and you,

10:38.269 --> 10:40.479
you are definitely
one fine lady.

10:40.938 --> 10:43.024
What's Italian
for 'keep going'?

10:44.317 --> 10:45.693
Wanna play a little pool?

10:46.110 --> 10:49.322
Oh I'm sorry I can't.
I have a boyfriend.

10:50.323 --> 10:51.490
He's in Africa.

10:54.660 --> 10:57.496
Well he is just missing out
on how beautiful you look.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.166
La mia fiora bella.

11:01.584 --> 11:02.710
Italian!

11:07.298 --> 11:08.633
Can you believe that?!

11:08.633 --> 11:10.801
Ah don't worry.
You still got me.

11:11.719 --> 11:13.012
Hi, I'm Kim.

11:13.429 --> 11:14.597
Dance with me.

11:15.431 --> 11:17.183
So long lame-o!

11:26.060 --> 11:27.019
Hey Samantha,

11:27.061 --> 11:28.813
you should have seen
your dopey husband today.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.481
He was supposed to fire Leo,

11:30.523 --> 11:33.234
but then he wussed out
and hired a new guy too.

11:34.026 --> 11:38.072
It's like the time I went to break up with this
chick and I ended up doing it with her AND her mom.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.409
I understand why you
couldn't fire anyone.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.619
On the outside you're
rough and cynical,

11:43.661 --> 11:47.582
but underneath is all you're just a sweet
curly-haired boy who likes to be tickled.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.667
Really?!

11:51.502 --> 11:53.087
Kelso, if you
try to tickle me,

11:53.087 --> 11:56.757
I swear to God I rip off your arm and
tickle the bloody hole with your own hand.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.388
You'll figure out what to do
honey, you have great instincts.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.057
You have a great butt too,
but that's a whole other thing

12:06.726 --> 12:08.144
She is awesome.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.272
Hey Sam, let me ask you a
question about being a stripper.

12:11.314 --> 12:12.648
Can I see your boobs?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.988
Oh Samantha.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.490
You're here.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.701
Did Red talk to
you by any chance?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.995
Mr. Forman? No. Why?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.830
Oh. Well. Uhhm.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.333
"What's that? Be
right there Eric!"

12:33.753 --> 12:37.298
Then my psychiatrist said
the reason I always want sex

12:37.340 --> 12:41.719
is because I never got apporoval from my
parents so I'm trying to find it somewhere else.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.930
Do you think he's right?

12:44.639 --> 12:46.557
Dear God I hope so!

12:48.935 --> 12:51.896
Who does that guy think he
is rejecting me like that?!

12:51.938 --> 12:55.024
I am the hottest girl
here! Right Fez?

12:59.403 --> 13:00.613
Hey you!

13:01.239 --> 13:02.240
Mark is it?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.491
Yeah.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.284
I don't know
where you're from.

13:05.368 --> 13:09.038
But I'll have you know, I
am the catch of Point Place.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.166
That's true. That's how
she signed my yearbook.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.502
Ah come back here!

13:14.919 --> 13:17.630
Nobody ignores
Jerky Backhart!

13:18.381 --> 13:20.424
I am adorable!

13:20.466 --> 13:23.427
I am engaging and
I'm DAMN likeable.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.390
And if you're too
stupid to see that,

13:27.390 --> 13:29.267
then I feel sorry for you!

13:29.433 --> 13:32.395
Cause if anyone should be
the center of attention here,

13:32.728 --> 13:33.855
it's me.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.398
Jackie!

13:38.780 --> 13:40.615
What the hell is
a "boobs out"?

13:49.040 --> 13:50.541
Okay, your turn!

13:56.339 --> 13:58.216
Ah Samantha, there
you are, good.

13:58.257 --> 14:01.010
Hi Mr. Forman. I
was just unpacking.

14:01.344 --> 14:02.637
Aren't these cute?

14:02.679 --> 14:03.262
Oh!

14:05.390 --> 14:07.475
I mean you can't
tell like this.

14:07.517 --> 14:08.768
You have to picture
them like this

14:10.895 --> 14:14.107
Plus they hold dollar bills
better then anything I own.

14:15.108 --> 14:17.443
I'm going upstairs
to find you a wallet!

14:23.157 --> 14:25.076
Hey Randy, come here.
I want to talk to you.

14:25.159 --> 14:26.995
Yeah sure, but
check this out first

14:27.036 --> 14:30.498
See these guys over there? They
think Leo is an Almond brother.

14:31.666 --> 14:33.793
- Why would they think that?
- I told them!

14:34.460 --> 14:35.253
Wow,

14:35.545 --> 14:37.422
Leo is an Almond brother?!

14:38.423 --> 14:39.465
Yeah man.

14:39.674 --> 14:41.718
We were overstocked with
Almond Brothers albums.

14:41.759 --> 14:45.179
So I figured meeting one of the guys of
the band would put people in a buying mood.

14:45.596 --> 14:47.140
And it totally worked!

14:48.474 --> 14:49.767
And Leo's up for this?

14:49.809 --> 14:51.769
Oh he has no idea
what is going on.

14:52.395 --> 14:55.857
I mean... at all.
He's really out of it.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.568
You know now that
you mention it,

14:58.693 --> 15:02.822
if we give him a hat and some sunglasses we
could probably use him to move some ZZ Top!

15:03.114 --> 15:04.115
Yeah.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.201
Your friend here might be
pretty enough to pass of as Cher.

15:08.494 --> 15:09.329
Yeah.

15:10.246 --> 15:13.082
That's not a bad
idea Andy Gibb!

15:16.628 --> 15:18.212
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

15:18.254 --> 15:19.047
Oh.

15:20.048 --> 15:23.426
I guess I just wanted to congratulate you
on your new job here at the record store.

15:23.468 --> 15:26.471
I name you senior vice-president
in charge of scams.

15:26.512 --> 15:28.097
Alright man!

15:28.681 --> 15:30.808
Man, I can't fire Leo.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.185
He's like a father to me.

15:32.644 --> 15:34.145
Well like a friend.

15:35.146 --> 15:37.106
Well he's like a guy
who always has lighter.

15:38.232 --> 15:39.025
Whoho.

15:39.150 --> 15:43.905
So if you're not gonna fire Randy, and
you're not gonna fire Leo, I got a question.

15:44.113 --> 15:45.823
Can I see your wife boobs?

15:48.451 --> 15:50.453
Hey guys, guess what.

15:50.828 --> 15:53.331
One of the Almond
Brothers is here!

15:58.628 --> 16:00.797
This new guy
Randy is awesome!

16:00.838 --> 16:04.509
Today he was looking over the records, and
he figured out it be easier to find things

16:04.509 --> 16:06.803
if we just
alphabetized them.

16:07.971 --> 16:10.848
Hey, do you know what
you were doing just now?

16:11.557 --> 16:12.809
No, what?

16:13.017 --> 16:15.311
Telling your wife
about your day.

16:15.645 --> 16:16.813
Pretty cool huh?

16:17.063 --> 16:18.189
Didn't suck.

16:20.858 --> 16:23.778
Oh good. You're both here.

16:24.195 --> 16:26.739
We want to talk to you
about your marriage.

16:27.532 --> 16:30.076
Steven, I've come to
think of you as a son,

16:30.118 --> 16:33.538
and so I want to give you
some honest, hartfelt advise.

16:33.788 --> 16:35.915
Get your head
out of your ass.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.711
You two barely
know eachother.

16:39.752 --> 16:43.464
Not to mention that I saw a TV
movie where someone like you moved in

16:43.506 --> 16:45.258
and killed the whole family.

16:48.928 --> 16:50.596
Steven honey,

16:50.638 --> 16:53.850
if this isn't what you
want, you should say so now.

16:55.184 --> 16:56.978
Yeah, you should.

16:57.937 --> 17:02.358
Hyde, if you don't want me here, I'll
pack up my things and leave tonight.

17:05.194 --> 17:06.820
No man, it's cool.

17:09.073 --> 17:10.700
Okay then.

17:12.827 --> 17:14.369
Oh she's staying.

17:15.747 --> 17:16.539
Well

17:16.998 --> 17:20.667
Well I guess I'll go set an extra place
at the table for stripper... supper!

17:25.423 --> 17:28.468
You're never gonna believe
this! I drove here this way.

17:33.723 --> 17:35.725
Jackie, will you
please come out?

17:35.808 --> 17:37.894
I don't think even
anyone saw you.

17:42.857 --> 17:43.858
OH MY GOD!

17:47.236 --> 17:50.031
I'm sorry about my friend,
she's a little prudish.

17:50.949 --> 17:53.409
She's not as free with her
body as I hope you will be.

17:55.870 --> 17:57.205
Ready to go baby?

17:57.497 --> 18:00.333
Hey buddy, the only guy
she is leaving with is me!

18:01.084 --> 18:04.045
Unless you just wanna do it in the
bathroom, then we can leave separately.

18:05.630 --> 18:08.299
Fez, there is something
I need to tell you.

18:08.633 --> 18:09.968
Mark and I are married.

18:12.136 --> 18:12.929
What?

18:14.097 --> 18:17.642
Yeah we come here every weekend and
watch eachother hit on strangers.

18:17.934 --> 18:20.895
It makes for some ultra hot
action when we get back home!

18:21.688 --> 18:24.357
Wait, yeah Eric and
I tried that once.

18:24.399 --> 18:27.986
I got three phone numbers and he
got the highscore on Space Invaders.

18:29.821 --> 18:31.823
Wait, you do this
every weekend?!

18:31.864 --> 18:35.243
You shower some poor loser with affection
and then toss him aside when you're done?!

18:35.618 --> 18:36.577
Yeah.

18:38.538 --> 18:39.747
See you next weekend...

18:45.586 --> 18:47.463
I gotta say, Sam
is pretty cool.

18:47.463 --> 18:48.298
Yeah?

18:48.589 --> 18:50.758
Yeah yesterday for
no reason at all,

18:50.800 --> 18:54.846
she grabbed a beer out of the
fridge and just like gave it to me.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.683
I mean what is
that all about?

18:59.892 --> 19:02.895
Maybe that is what husbands
and wives do for eachother?

19:02.979 --> 19:04.981
Craziest damn
thing I ever saw.

19:06.232 --> 19:09.527
Uhm Steven? I just wanna let
you know that we're through.

19:09.569 --> 19:14.198
If you're gonna go off and marry someone you
don't even know, then we can't be together anymore

19:17.160 --> 19:20.955
Okay. Well I guess you always
have Kelso to fall back on.

19:21.914 --> 19:23.041
Or Fez.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.543
Hey what? Did
I hear my name?

19:26.377 --> 19:27.962
Are Jackie and I
going to do it?

19:29.213 --> 19:31.049
Can somebody tell me
what is going on?!

19:31.841 --> 19:34.302
Steven I have been
so stupid for so long.

19:34.344 --> 19:37.555
I tried to force Michael to marry
me, I tried to force you to marry me.

19:37.597 --> 19:41.392
And last night I threw myself at some
unavailable creep I didn't even like.

19:41.851 --> 19:44.103
Well, now you've
hit a new low.

19:45.146 --> 19:48.566
Throwing yourself at
some guy on Rosh Hashanah.

19:52.111 --> 19:55.156
So you know what? I'm done
making an ass of myself for you.

19:55.198 --> 19:56.991
Or any other guys.

19:57.075 --> 19:58.034
In fact,

19:58.284 --> 20:00.036
I'm done with
guys completely.

20:00.578 --> 20:01.746
Hear that Hyde?

20:03.289 --> 20:07.377
We screwed her up so bad she's switching
to chicks! How awesome are we!

20:11.021 --> 20:12.940
So I was thinking
about you all week,

20:12.982 --> 20:15.776
how cute and flustered you
looked when I kissed you.

20:15.974 --> 20:17.504
I really liked that.

20:17.736 --> 20:19.446
Yeah. Me too.

20:22.770 --> 20:25.603
You know what, this too creepy
even for me.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.430
Enjoy your sick life together.

20:33.839 --> 20:35.597
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't even know what it is about.

20:38.197 --> 20:39.265
So where were we?
