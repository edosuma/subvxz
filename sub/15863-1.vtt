03:32.170 --> 03:34.752
My people, my people.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.460
Now, the new government
has announced

03:37.634 --> 03:39.841
free education for all.

03:40.011 --> 03:44.380
All they want is for you to turn up
with a birth certificate.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.972
A government that keeps its promise?
Unbelievable!

04:58.381 --> 05:00.212
My son needs to be educated.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.045
Kamau chege, kamau chege. Chege!

05:14.272 --> 05:17.810
Teacher Jane, teacher Jane!
Come on, he's asking for you.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.100
Please!

05:20.278 --> 05:21.859
Teacher Katherine!

05:22.030 --> 05:24.567
Teacher Katherine, can you come?

05:24.741 --> 05:27.232
Ok, give me a moment, please.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.698
This is not a birth certificate.
Mama, you are not the first.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.584
May I help you, mzee?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.586
This is a primary school.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.058
Mzee, they meant children, not adults.

05:53.228 --> 05:57.688
No. I heard on the radio,
with my own ears.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.270
They said everybody.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.527
We have 200 students
and only 50 desks. Look at this.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.565
We can't waste them on an old man
with one foot in the grave.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.733
Mzee, where are your exercise books?

06:09.911 --> 06:13.620
You need two,
and one hb pencil, sharp,

06:13.790 --> 06:15.155
with a rubber on one end.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.369
Those are the regulations.

06:23.633 --> 06:27.421
Pole, mzee. Pole.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.868
Good morning, boys and girls.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.379
Good morning, madam!

07:04.549 --> 07:08.292
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you, madam!

07:08.470 --> 07:12.008
- How do you do?
- How do you do, madam?

07:12.182 --> 07:14.218
I do very well, thank you.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.930
I am so excited to have you here
all in my classroom.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.891
Welcome. Karibuni.
Sit down, please.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.897
Thank you, madam.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.060
Now, I know that some of you
may be a little nervous,

07:26.237 --> 07:27.977
but there's nothing to be afraid of.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.899
Learning is about having fun,
so we are all here to have fun.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.487
- Si ndiyo?
- Yes.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.778
Alright, let me check.
Has everybody got their books?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.117
- Yes!
- Very good!

07:38.291 --> 07:40.657
- And has everybody got their pencils?
- Yes!

07:40.835 --> 07:44.453
- Ok. Good... I heard a few noes.
- Who said no?

07:44.631 --> 07:47.418
Ok, well, Francis, can you give out
some pencils, please?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.833
Ok...

07:50.011 --> 07:52.844
Paris and pauline,
come to the front, please.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.175
So, everyone, tomorrow,
your books and your pencils.

07:55.350 --> 07:58.092
- Yes.
- Ok, very good, very good.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.061
Sorry, sorry, excuse me.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.365
Go home, mzee.
I can see you've had a hard life.

08:17.539 --> 08:19.495
Go home and rest in peace.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.202
Rest in peace?

08:21.376 --> 08:22.866
I'm not dead.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.625
Look, mzee...

08:24.796 --> 08:30.132
My name is kimani ng'ang'a maruge.

08:30.301 --> 08:34.260
Well, kimani ng'ang'a maruge,

08:34.431 --> 08:37.342
we cannot accept anyone
without a school uniform,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.554
and that means school shoes too.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.436
And you do not have money
for such things.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.766
Jane?

08:50.822 --> 08:55.532
Mzee, why does someone as old as you
want to go to school?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.613
I want to learn to read.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.574
We've got too many pupils already.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.282
I wish I could help you.

09:04.461 --> 09:08.170
I'm sorry. Pole.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.186
Alright, here we are.

10:48.356 --> 10:52.269
- Ok, asante sana.
- Asante.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.979
Goodbye, teacher.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.277
You know that old man
I told you about?

11:00.451 --> 11:03.659
He came back again.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.242
I hope you did not let him in.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.998
The poor old boy might be senile.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.706
Why don't you stick to battles
you can win, hm?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.962
Like finding more desks.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.882
How was your week?

11:18.052 --> 11:21.670
The Swedish company
hasn't paid me the consulting fee.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.715
The government job is starting to sound
very appealing.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.259
Except it had to be full time
in Nairobi,

11:27.437 --> 11:29.598
and then we'd never
see each other at all.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.728
Not if you came to Nairobi.

11:31.900 --> 11:36.769
We'll live in a big house, make babies.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.811
Have a little bunch of obinchus.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.824
Charles, I can't.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.985
The school needs me.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.994
What about me?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.581
You've got me.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.755
We've got five children
to a desk here, sir.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.423
There are children sitting on the floor.

14:12.602 --> 14:15.389
They can't work like this, Mr. Kipruto.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.318
You need a form for every single
new child, in triplicate?

14:23.488 --> 14:26.275
No, you can't be serious. I don't
have time to do that, Mr. Kipruto.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.861
Could you not just take my word for it?

14:29.035 --> 14:32.323
Yes, I know, regulations.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.613
Good day to you too, Mr. Kipruto.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.790
What am I to do, Alfred?

14:37.960 --> 14:42.795
Our esteemed superintendent has made
one of his executive decisions.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.582
You've got to see this.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.716
What?

15:03.277 --> 15:06.485
You don't give up easily,
do you, maruge?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.942
You can't fall for this.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.403
You'll be asking for trouble
with the authorities.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.363
You know he's right, maruge?

15:13.538 --> 15:15.950
What will I say to
the board of education?

15:16.124 --> 15:17.864
Hm?

15:18.042 --> 15:21.205
What will I say to the parents?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.586
I'll be a good pupil.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.380
I'll work very hard.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.916
If kipruto finds out...

15:28.094 --> 15:30.335
Kipruto's not the head here, Alfred.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.799
I am.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.471
Let him in.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.267
I'm making an executive decision.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.527
Let maruge in.

16:00.751 --> 16:04.084
Maruge? Welcome.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.836
Karibu.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.862
Thank you.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.077
Francis, take your seat.

16:45.963 --> 16:49.205
Class, we have a new student today,

16:49.383 --> 16:51.795
and his name is maruge.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.676
Welcome, maruge!

17:01.646 --> 17:03.261
Jennifer, raise your hand, please.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.896
I would like you to go
and sit next to Jennifer

17:06.067 --> 17:07.647
at the back there, please, maruge.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.026
If I sit far, I won't see. I can't.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.561
Ok.

17:12.740 --> 17:16.073
Uh... Suzanne, can you sit there?

17:16.243 --> 17:19.486
Sarah, can you sit next to niva, please?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.780
Maruge, you can sit there.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.915
Sit next to niva, ok, Sarah?

17:25.086 --> 17:27.498
Back down. Yes? Good.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.797
Let's begin!

17:31.968 --> 17:34.630
Open your exercise books.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.136
Pencils nice and sharp.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.217
Nice and sharp!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.303
My pencil is my friend.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.934
I keep him to the end.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.687
My pencil is my friend.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.473
I keep him to the end.

17:49.652 --> 17:55.272
Ok, we are going to begin
with small letters today,

17:55.449 --> 17:59.158
beginning with the letter 'a', ok?

17:59.328 --> 18:03.571
And this is how we write
our small letter 'a'.

18:03.749 --> 18:09.585
Ok, a fatty, a thinny.

18:09.755 --> 18:14.715
A fatty, a thinny.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.503
Please continue writing
your lower-case 'a's.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.423
Brendan, Brendan. Sorry, darling.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.764
Maruge, this is how you hold a pencil.

18:25.771 --> 18:30.435
Ok, you hold it between your thumb
and your first finger.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.943
Very good. And you press lightly...
Not too hard, ok?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.649
Very good.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.441
Good, we are continuing,
repeating after me.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.782
A fatty,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.492
a thinny.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.873
A fatty,

18:48.044 --> 18:50.911
a thinny.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.545
A fatty,

18:53.716 --> 18:56.207
a thinny.

18:56.385 --> 19:00.674
A fatty, a thinny...

19:38.552 --> 19:41.134
Kamau, come here.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.138
What's with the old man in uniform?

19:44.308 --> 19:46.219
Yeah, he's in our school.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.476
Get inside and start working.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.477
Come on.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.502
F-i-t.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.918
A thinny.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.671
F-i-t.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.806
'Fit'.

20:27.977 --> 20:33.097
F-i-t.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.811
A thinny.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.364
Maruge!

20:53.127 --> 20:55.243
Maruge!

20:56.589 --> 20:58.329
Stay out of the school, huh?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.208
School is no place for an old man!

21:02.386 --> 21:04.092
You don't belong there!

21:47.431 --> 21:49.342
Get up. Get up.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.930
Get into line!

21:55.815 --> 21:58.352
Move! Get out of the way!

21:58.526 --> 22:00.437
Move out!

22:12.414 --> 22:15.906
Where are they, the mau mau?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.078
Well done, Peter.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.738
Makofi for Peter!

22:55.916 --> 22:58.703
Well done, well done, Peter.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.336
Try again another day. A wonderful boy!

23:02.506 --> 23:04.792
Ok, who's going to write for me
the number four?

23:04.967 --> 23:07.253
The number four?
Who is going to write for me?

23:07.428 --> 23:10.591
Suzanne. Suzanne, come.
Come and write for me the number four.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.476
Well done, Suzanne.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.602
Makofi for Suzanne, please.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.480
Well done, well done, Suzanne!

23:22.651 --> 23:26.064
Try again another day. A wonderful girl!

23:26.238 --> 23:27.944
A wonderful girl! Very good.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.697
Ok, next after four is five.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.109
Who is going to write the number five
for me?

23:33.287 --> 23:35.994
Kamau, come and write
the number five for us.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.701
Come.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.377
Come and write the number five

23:43.547 --> 23:46.710
so that we all know how to write
the number five.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.881
Stop it!

23:58.979 --> 24:00.765
Is that how we write the number five?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.305
No.

24:02.483 --> 24:03.973
No, it is not, kamau.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.687
I was just kidding.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.647
Ok. No more jokes.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.413
Excellent! Very good, kamau.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.203
Makofi for kamau, please.

24:26.382 --> 24:29.374
Well done, well done, kamau.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.669
Try again another day. A wonderful boy.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.635
Ok, maruge, can you come
and write for us the number six?

24:39.269 --> 24:43.558
Maruge! Can you come
and write the number six for us?

24:43.732 --> 24:46.394
Maruge!

24:46.568 --> 24:49.435
Hey, stop.

24:52.408 --> 24:57.118
Maruge, will you write the number six
for us?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.495
Ok, can someone else write me
the number six?

25:07.673 --> 25:10.005
Who is going to write me
the number six?

26:49.066 --> 26:50.522
Good morning, class.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.855
Good morning, teacher Alfred.

26:54.029 --> 26:57.317
Teacher Alfred is going to inspect
for neatness, yes?

26:57.491 --> 26:59.482
Ok, sit down, sit down.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.651
Thank you, teacher.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.655
Patrick, hm-hm. Good, good, good.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.826
Pauline. Good.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.664
Good.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.503
Where is the date?

27:17.678 --> 27:19.214
Good, good, good.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.686
Maruge, your pencil's very blunt.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.813
What kind of example are you setting?

27:31.984 --> 27:34.225
Go sharpen it now
and don't let it happen again.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.626
Malisa, malisa, malisa.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.923
Should I help you
to hear a little bit better?

29:21.510 --> 29:23.375
Like this, maruge.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.012
Maruge? Let's get you some air.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.789
- What's wrong with him?
- Stay with my class.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.349
It wasn't me!

29:41.113 --> 29:42.523
What's wrong, maruge?

29:52.416 --> 29:55.954
I think this is all too much for you
at your age, maruge.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.959
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

29:59.089 --> 30:01.250
It won't happen again.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.626
What is that?

30:07.639 --> 30:09.470
I was in the camps.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.257
You were mau mau?

30:14.313 --> 30:15.894
Yes.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.940
Tell me what happened
in the classroom, maruge.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.773
Then I can help you.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.195
I must go back to class
to finish my work.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.708
I was a prisoner.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.625
The British stole our land,

32:51.803 --> 32:54.920
so we said they must give it back.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.465
They told us to be quiet.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.931
So we spoke very loud.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.222
To some,

33:05.400 --> 33:08.483
in 1963.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.728
That was uhuru.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.821
What does 'uhuru' mean?

33:24.127 --> 33:26.368
It's 'freedom'.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.080
Freedom!

33:30.258 --> 33:31.623
Freedom!

33:31.801 --> 33:33.587
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:33.762 --> 33:35.298
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

33:35.472 --> 33:37.087
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:37.265 --> 33:38.630
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

33:38.808 --> 33:41.390
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:41.561 --> 33:42.926
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:43.104 --> 33:44.104
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:44.272 --> 33:45.272
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:45.315 --> 33:46.680
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

33:46.858 --> 33:47.893
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

33:48.068 --> 33:49.353
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

33:49.528 --> 33:50.893
- Uhuru!
- Uhuru!

34:00.163 --> 34:01.699
What is this?

34:03.124 --> 34:06.366
He's going to be a problem, for all of us.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.087
Come on! Come outside
and start working.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.581
Listen, my friend.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.664
It doesn't have to be like this.

36:15.965 --> 36:19.924
Renounce your oath
and you can go home.

36:25.892 --> 36:28.304
Renounce the oath!

36:29.896 --> 36:31.056
Again.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.447
People, my people.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.986
I'm hearing rumblings

38:11.164 --> 38:15.248
<i>that an old man
has actually gone back to school.</i>

38:15.418 --> 38:18.205
<i>An old man going back to school!</i>

38:18.379 --> 38:19.494
Unbelievable.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.754
Excellent work.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.166
Come, kamau.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.461
Let's see what you have done.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.129
Your one's very good.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.797
Very good, very good.

38:30.975 --> 38:33.216
Your fives again, kamau.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.976
Did we not go over this? Yes.

38:36.147 --> 38:39.059
So why have you written them
the wrong way again?

38:39.234 --> 38:40.599
Hm?

38:40.777 --> 38:42.517
You have to write them again, kamau.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.061
- Sawa?
- Yes, miss.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.527
Maruge?

38:49.702 --> 38:51.567
Excellent.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.452
You are good with your numbers,
maruge.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.659
Excellent work.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.701
Very good. I'm very happy with you.

38:58.878 --> 39:03.212
Come, Francis.
Let's take a look at what you have done.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.591
Oh, I like that.
Your work is always very neat.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.717
You're a very clever boy.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.674
Ok. Excellent.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.556
Because you have done so well,
you're going to get a star.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.078
Ow! You're hurting me!

39:36.249 --> 39:37.659
Ow!

39:40.461 --> 39:43.578
Maruge!

39:43.756 --> 39:46.714
You do not hit him!

39:48.469 --> 39:51.552
<i>Honestly, ladies tell me
kikuyus have mad blood,</i>

39:51.723 --> 39:53.759
<i>but their back story's another one.</i>

39:53.933 --> 39:56.470
<i>Kikuyus work like stallions.
They're very...</i>

39:56.644 --> 39:59.260
Maruge, stop it! Maruge!

40:00.899 --> 40:02.309
- Stop it!
- Hey!

40:02.483 --> 40:05.975
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?

40:07.572 --> 40:10.359
I couldn't believe my ears
when I got a phone call from the press

40:10.533 --> 40:12.899
telling me about an old man
in one of my primary schools!

40:13.077 --> 40:15.284
Who is he? Why is he
in school uniform?

40:17.332 --> 40:19.197
His name is maruge.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.990
Mzee.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.626
He wanted to come to school,
so I let him.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.840
What do you mean?
This is a primary school.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.597
Sir, the government said
everybody has the right to go to school.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.977
Just because our politicians are stupid
doesn't mean we have to be as well!

40:41.147 --> 40:42.728
He can't stay here.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.641
Adults must go to the adult school.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.854
Now, see to it that he leaves here now.

40:50.198 --> 40:53.736
Sir, he fought the British.

40:53.910 --> 40:57.494
- He was imprisoned in the camps.
- Oh, mau mau, huh?

40:57.664 --> 40:59.996
Typical kikuyu.
I should have known.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.122
Excuse me?

41:02.293 --> 41:03.999
I thought tribalism was over.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.206
This has nothing to do with tribalism.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.212
It's about doing
what's right for the school.

41:08.383 --> 41:11.841
An old man like him does not belong
in a classroom full of children.

41:12.011 --> 41:14.923
Now, we'll continue this conversation
in the office.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.516
Maruge...

41:28.695 --> 41:30.105
He's a bloody kalenjin.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.940
You too, maruge?

41:32.115 --> 41:35.403
You know, after independence,
we <i>all</i> became Kenyans.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.941
The kalenjins were loyalists!

41:37.120 --> 41:39.361
So were my family loyal to the British!

41:39.539 --> 41:41.905
So was everybody
if they wanted to stay alive!

41:42.083 --> 41:46.201
And don't look at me like that.
The British never gave people a choice.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.415
You were either for them
or you were against them,

41:48.589 --> 41:50.500
and if you were against them,
they killed you.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.917
I had children.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.211
Two children!

41:57.306 --> 41:59.217
I had a family!

42:00.852 --> 42:02.808
The British killed them.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.058
We chose.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.099
The kikuyus chose.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.233
And we paid.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.777
We paid!

42:30.423 --> 42:33.415
Come to class. Come to class,
come to class, come to class.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.918
Go to class, go to class.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.111
He says I've got to get rid of maruge.

43:04.165 --> 43:06.247
He's sending him off to the adult school.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.123
Where is his compassion?

43:08.294 --> 43:10.125
<i>Jane, Jane, just stop.</i>

43:10.296 --> 43:11.911
That's not what he's saying.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.502
He's just saying maruge cannot go
to children's school.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.085
<i>Why are you defending him?</i>

43:16.260 --> 43:19.548
The British killed his family.
We have a duty to help him.

43:19.722 --> 43:22.634
The mau mau killed people too, ok?

43:22.809 --> 43:25.801
But that's got nothing to do with an old
man going to a children's school.

43:25.978 --> 43:26.978
<i>Fine.</i>

43:27.146 --> 43:29.728
No-one's going to fight
for maruge, so I will.

43:29.899 --> 43:32.015
Ok, please do not go over
kipruto's head.

43:32.193 --> 43:34.434
I work with these people
and I know how they are.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.898
They won't take kindly to this.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.734
You know I'm always on your side.

43:38.908 --> 43:41.069
- Love you.
- 'Bye.

43:47.500 --> 43:50.958
I appreciate your concern,
but my hands are tied.

43:51.129 --> 43:53.620
Maruge is such a hard worker.

43:54.674 --> 43:57.086
He's a great role model
for the children.

43:57.260 --> 44:00.673
If we let maruge in,
how can we refuse others?

44:00.847 --> 44:03.008
Our schools could be flooded
with old people.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.672
This would be taking away

44:04.851 --> 44:07.513
from the precious resources
we need for our children.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.020
Thank you for your time,
madam secretary.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.603
You're welcome.

44:14.777 --> 44:18.895
Mrs. Obinchu, one of the consultants
working with the Danish government,

44:19.073 --> 44:20.438
Charles obinchu.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.277
Charles is my husband.

44:22.451 --> 44:25.193
- Give him my best.
- I will.

44:25.371 --> 44:30.832
Mrs. Obinchu, the children
are Kenya's future.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.687
I'm sorry, maruge.

45:32.104 --> 45:33.844
I have no money, no money.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.388
There's nothing for free.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.147
You cannot go, you're too old.

46:39.005 --> 46:41.667
So today we're focusing
on singular and plural.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.797
Let's start with 'bed', alright?

46:43.968 --> 46:46.209
So, 'bed', the plural for 'bed' is 'beds'.

46:46.387 --> 46:49.049
That's b-e-d-s.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.134
Alright, so you just add an 's'.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.516
Alright, now, the plural for 'lamp'...

46:53.686 --> 46:55.096
Please.

46:55.271 --> 46:58.638
The plural for 'lamp'...

46:58.816 --> 47:00.807
Alright, how about 'death'?

47:00.985 --> 47:03.146
The plural for 'death'...

47:15.124 --> 47:16.614
- Kwa heri!
- Asante!

47:16.792 --> 47:18.157
See you later, teacher.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.997
Maruge, what are you doing here?

47:20.171 --> 47:22.127
Come inside.

47:22.298 --> 47:26.007
I took the oath to get our land back
from the British.

47:26.177 --> 47:30.136
Maruge, you don't have to
tell me this.

47:30.306 --> 47:33.048
What is kikuyu without land?

47:33.225 --> 47:36.433
The masai, it's cattle.

47:36.604 --> 47:38.890
But for us, it's land.

47:39.065 --> 47:42.432
That's why we were fighting.

47:43.944 --> 47:47.482
But we are nothing if we cannot read.

47:47.656 --> 47:50.022
We are useless.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.205
When I was a boy,

47:58.376 --> 48:00.662
there was no money for education.

48:02.171 --> 48:04.878
I worked on a white man's farm.

48:06.884 --> 48:10.297
Then came the fight for freedom.

48:11.389 --> 48:12.424
Maruge...

48:12.598 --> 48:14.054
I have a letter.

48:14.225 --> 48:15.590
What do you mean?

48:15.768 --> 48:18.805
That's why I came to the school.

48:18.979 --> 48:22.346
I must read it for myself.

48:24.110 --> 48:27.102
I have to understand.

48:28.155 --> 48:29.816
Please.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.275
Teach me to read, Mrs. Obinchu.

48:39.583 --> 48:43.701
Well, I know we've had this conversation
many times before about maruge,

48:43.879 --> 48:47.042
but I was wondering if you might
be willing to reconsider.

48:47.216 --> 48:49.753
Mr. Kipruto, they just mess around
at the adult school.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.463
He didn't learn a thing.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.262
Yes.

48:55.433 --> 48:57.515
Yes, of course I'm grateful.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.514
Kwa heri.

49:03.399 --> 49:05.515
Maruge, I'm very sorry.
I've done everything...

49:05.693 --> 49:07.729
That bloody kipruto
can go to hell!

49:07.903 --> 49:09.506
The adult school
is better than nothing...

49:09.530 --> 49:10.940
I'm not going!

49:11.115 --> 49:15.233
He's kalenjin. His people were in bed
with the British.

49:15.411 --> 49:17.197
Bloody loyalist!

49:17.371 --> 49:20.204
I'm not going. Not me!

49:20.374 --> 49:23.036
Let him go to the other school himself!

50:16.138 --> 50:18.003
I came to say goodbye.

50:20.267 --> 50:24.135
I told them a goat cannot read.

50:26.232 --> 50:29.019
A goat cannot write his name.

50:30.152 --> 50:35.021
They must study hard,
or they'll be like me...

50:35.199 --> 50:39.488
An old man no better than that goat.

50:46.502 --> 50:50.290
You know, goats are
very clever animals.

50:50.464 --> 50:52.546
They never give up.

50:54.426 --> 50:57.293
We can learn a very good lesson
from them.

51:02.434 --> 51:06.427
Class, I have
an important announcement.

51:06.605 --> 51:11.599
From now on, maruge is going to be
my teaching assistant.

51:11.777 --> 51:14.769
Well done, well done, maruge.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.357
I'm impressed.

51:16.532 --> 51:18.739
How did you get them all
to behave so well?

51:18.909 --> 51:24.449
I told them if they didn't behave,
I'll clobber them with my stick.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.411
Maruge!

52:16.342 --> 52:18.048
Wait a minute,
there's Mr. Maruge!

52:18.218 --> 52:19.583
There's Mr. Maruge.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.343
Mr. Maruge, Mr. Maruge.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.763
Alright, alright!

52:28.937 --> 52:32.850
Please, please, if we're going to do this,
let us at least do it in an orderly way.

52:33.025 --> 52:36.483
If you want to speak to maruge,
one question at a time.

52:36.654 --> 52:38.019
His hearing is poor. Please.

52:38.197 --> 52:39.562
Mr. Maruge, CNN Washington.

52:39.740 --> 52:42.197
Mr. Maruge, why didn't you go to school
when you were younger?

52:42.368 --> 52:45.280
There was no free education for
black people when maruge was a boy.

52:45.454 --> 52:47.285
What is the motivation now?

52:59.343 --> 53:01.004
What did he say?

53:01.178 --> 53:04.386
He says, "the power is in the pen."

53:06.225 --> 53:09.592
To read and understand,
it's very important.

53:09.770 --> 53:13.228
This is one way of finishing poverty
among us.

53:14.400 --> 53:18.268
And the Bible... I don't trust
those preachers in the churches.

53:18.445 --> 53:19.445
Who does?

53:19.488 --> 53:20.853
Mr. Maruge, BBC London.

53:21.031 --> 53:24.148
Is the Kenyan government doing
enough for education in this country?

53:24.326 --> 53:27.568
Yes, yes... free education! For all.

53:27.746 --> 53:29.577
Mr. Maruge, ntv Nairobi.

53:33.377 --> 53:34.992
Do you think this is right?

53:35.170 --> 53:38.287
She's just drawing attention to herself
and the school.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.126
It's not right for anybody.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.756
Alfred.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.086
Hey?

53:45.264 --> 53:48.051
You are the most negative person
I know.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.716
This is a good thing for the school.
Just relax.

53:55.691 --> 53:59.309
<i>People, the world has gone
absolutely mad.</i>

53:59.486 --> 54:02.603
And look, 'New York times',
'L.A. times', 'Kenya times',

54:02.781 --> 54:03.896
all the 'times',

54:04.074 --> 54:06.110
<i>BBC, 'daily telegraph'.</i>

54:06.285 --> 54:10.073
<i>The world is finally talking,
"maruge, maruge!"</i>

54:10.247 --> 54:14.832
<i>And not to forget the teacher
who took maruge to school at 84 years.</i>

54:15.002 --> 54:16.788
It's absolutely crazy!

54:16.962 --> 54:21.752
<i>Now, this mzee was once
a mau mau veteran, war fighter,</i>

54:21.925 --> 54:23.461
<i>who wanted Kenya to say...</i>

54:26.555 --> 54:27.670
'Can'.

54:27.848 --> 54:31.261
<i>Now, despite his age,
he too is demanding free education</i>

54:31.435 --> 54:35.348
<i>and head teacher Jane obinchu
has welcomed him through the doors.</i>

54:35.522 --> 54:36.887
<i>Many parents are outraged</i>

54:37.065 --> 54:39.852
<i>and feel that such a valuable place
should not be wasted</i>

54:40.027 --> 54:41.733
<i>on such an old man.</i>

54:41.904 --> 54:43.940
<i>And, as feelings run increasingly high,</i>

54:44.114 --> 54:47.356
<i>this controversy is no doubt set to grow.</i>

54:56.418 --> 54:58.204
Habari yako?

55:01.632 --> 55:05.045
You don't care about our children.
You only care about yourself.

55:05.219 --> 55:06.659
You want your face in the newspapers

55:06.762 --> 55:08.522
so that you can fill your pockets
with money.

55:08.639 --> 55:10.425
How dare you say that to me!

55:10.599 --> 55:13.966
Every single child is important to me,
including your son.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.806
- Habari yako, Polo?
- Mzuri.

55:35.332 --> 55:38.119
Mau mau... have you seen? The title?

55:38.293 --> 55:40.033
Have you seen that?
Have you seen the title?

55:41.755 --> 55:44.542
84 years. 84! 84 years.

55:44.716 --> 55:46.206
Gone back to school.

55:46.385 --> 55:47.750
- How old are you?
- 55.

55:47.928 --> 55:49.338
55. You are a toddler.

56:02.860 --> 56:06.102
I don't want my son
being mixed with old men!

56:06.280 --> 56:07.861
Ok, everybody, please.

56:08.031 --> 56:10.943
I know that you are all upset.

56:11.118 --> 56:14.326
Please, would you listen to me?

56:14.496 --> 56:17.533
I think that we have a lot to learn
from maruge.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.245
He's helping us.

56:20.419 --> 56:24.207
Ok? The children have a lot
that they can learn from the old.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.793
I don't want him to teach my son, huh?

56:26.967 --> 56:28.673
Who is he? Who is he?

56:28.844 --> 56:30.835
Where is the teachers?

56:48.864 --> 56:50.695
Now look at this. Surely.

57:02.127 --> 57:04.368
What do you think you're doing?
You're running a circus!

57:04.546 --> 57:06.502
I told you to get rid of
that old man.

57:06.673 --> 57:08.954
You know what, Mr. Kipruto?
Why don't you just come clean?

57:09.092 --> 57:11.799
Is it because maruge is old
or is it because he's kikuyu

57:11.970 --> 57:13.551
that you don't want him here?

57:13.722 --> 57:16.179
This is not about tribes,
Mrs. Obinchu!

57:16.350 --> 57:18.841
Who do you think you are,
dictating the agenda?

57:19.019 --> 57:21.761
You're an employee.
You do as I tell you.

57:21.939 --> 57:24.897
Now, I'm warning you one last time.
He goes to the adult school!

57:25.067 --> 57:29.777
He's got no money, Mr. Kipruto.
He can't go to school anywhere else.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.903
He will have money soon.

57:32.074 --> 57:35.612
This kikuyu government is going to give
the mau mau compensation money.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.826
Compensation for what?
For killing their own people?

57:37.913 --> 57:39.653
Mr. Kipruto...

57:40.832 --> 57:44.825
Can't we just put the past behind us?

57:45.003 --> 57:48.086
The past is always present,
Mrs. Obinchu.

57:48.256 --> 57:50.747
Never forget that.

59:12.007 --> 59:13.668
Maruge.

59:48.877 --> 59:52.165
Ask her.
Ask her, is this her husband?

59:54.841 --> 59:56.957
Ask her, kikuyu?

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.681
Take the child off her.

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:16.689
Take this baby off her.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.478
Hey, kamau.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.332
Look. Look at his grades.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:03.875
He can't keep up with the others.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:05.544
Meaning that my son is stupid?

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.682
I'm not saying that your son
is stupid, Mr. Chege.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.297
All I'm saying is that
in our school

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.787
there's a certain level of attainment
that he needs to achieve

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:13.517
in order to move on to the next class.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:16.168
Otherwise, he repeats the same class
or goes to special school.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.395
My son has a right
for free education!

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.938
Do I make myself clear?

01:02:25.116 --> 01:02:26.481
I understand perfectly,
Mr. Chege.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.150
We're helping him
in every way we can.

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:29.693
You are not helping him! Huh?!

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:32.578
You're busy wasting your time
with that stupid old man.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.114
Look, I'm running a shop, huh?

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.874
And my son must be extremely good
in mathematics and science.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.629
This is not fair and this is not right!

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:47.169
Mr. Chege, I...

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:50.384
We'll deal with this
when you get home.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.483
Well, I guess we know he can dance.
How's he getting on in the classroom?

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:08.364
His maths is good,
but he really came here to read,

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:09.900
and it needs a lot more work.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:13.036
It's about finding time
for everyone.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:15.618
Come, come, come. Back to class!

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.498
Let's go to class.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:20.877
Ok, maruge, sound this for me.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.962
- And put it together...
- 'Sat'.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.503
Wonderful! Very good.

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:31.046
'Bat'.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:34.512
Well done, maruge.
That is very good, very good.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.768
Ok, let's move on to the next one.

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.932
- Together?
- 'Cat'.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:45.398
Excellent, maruge. Very good.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:47.656
Kamau?

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:51.157
We are working here.
Please go away.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:54.365
School is over. Please go home.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.489
Come, come.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:02.168
'Mat'.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.250
Oh, maruge,
you have done so well.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:05.789
Very good!

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:07.582
Ok, let's go over our sounds

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:10.628
and then we'll finish there
for today, ok?

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:14.218
'Ah', 'buh', 'kuh', 'duh'...

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.703
- Hello?
- <i>Jane obinchu?</i>

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.246
Yes?

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.131
<i>So now you are giving private lessons
to the old man, eh?</i>

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.252
Who is this?

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.591
<i>We are watching you.</i>

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:58.133
<i>We know you are alone in that house.</i>

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:00.802
<i>You'll want to take care.</i>

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:16.568
Walalaa! Hoo, hoo, hoo.
Wa wa wa wa!

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.362
Now, that's called money on wheels...
Mobile money.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.702
Politicians... what do they want now?

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:24.458
When I grow up,
that's the kind of car I'd like to drive,

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:26.085
but not as a politician.

I have no money.

- Old man...
- Leave me alone!

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:10.533
Go to the school and
teach maruge a lesson.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.411
Make sure and make no mistake.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.544
Scare him away from here for good.

Yes! Who are the elephants

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:42.315
Ok, are you ready?
Are you set? Let's go!

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.898
Ok, quick, so we can beat...

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:57.291

Get away from the window!

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:38.783
Let's go, let's go. The old bull is crazy.
Let's go, let's go!

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.326
Leave him! Leave him!

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.084
Let's go, man. Let's go!

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:52.004
- Go away!
- Stay there, kamau.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.685
You can do nothing.

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:12.699
This is getting out of hand, maruge.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.282
We are alright. It's nothing wrong.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:17.071
They won't come back.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:26.248
I'm ok. I'm alright. Just a few people
I've just annoyed. It's ok.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.520
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.575
"Long neck,

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.986
"tummy fat,

01:12:57.164 --> 01:13:01.328
"number 5 wears a hat."

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.793
Can you imagine that, kamau?

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:07.956
A man with a long neck

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:11.001
and a big tummy, fat,

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:13.294
and wears a hat!

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.257
"Long neck,

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:19.266
"tummy fat,

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:22.053
"number 5 wears a hat."

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.598
Good. Now I want you to try it.

01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:27.858
"Long neck,

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:31.021
"tummy fat...

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:36.280
"Number 5 wears a hat."

01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:38.991
Very good, kamau. Very good!

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:42.157
Want to try it again?
Yeah, good.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.452
"Long neck...

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.163
"Tummy fat,

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:53.005
"number 5 wears a hat."

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.044
Great!

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:56.883
You sure you can do it?

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.014
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:01.016
Yes, I know you can!

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:02.518
And I knew you could!

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.224
Yes.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.127
- For me?
- Yes.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.045
Thanks, Jonas.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.942
- I can't believe this.
- Hmm?

01:14:56.117 --> 01:14:58.654
He's transferred me.

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:01.114
What? Where to?

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:04.030
Turkana is 300 miles away from here.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.369
How are we supposed
to see each other?

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:09.707
You're not taking that transfer,
and that's clear.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.417
Well, I'm not resigning, Charles.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:15.503
I refuse to give kipruto the satisfaction
as a matter of principle.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.043
To hell with principle!

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.428
They are throwing bloody rocks
at the classroom.

01:15:19.598 --> 01:15:21.759
They transfer you.
I'm having problems at work.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.845
Can't you see what this thing
is doing to us?

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.885
So, what do you want me
to do, Charles? Hmm?

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:29.021
Go quietly and shut up,
like a good Kenyan woman?

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:31.398
"Women must be seen
and not heard," is that it?

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.855
You are seen, trust me.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.770
You are seen!

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:47.578
Seen?

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:51.372
Are you accusing me of something?

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:56.874
Jane,

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.135
people are beginning to talk.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:04.766
I get phone calls day and night,
telling me things.

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:07.722
That you're having an affair.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:10.559
Are you?

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.900
Are you having an affair?

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:20.443
How low can they go?

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:24.448
How far are you willing
to take this, Jane?

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:28.035
Why are you risking everything
because of this old man?

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.746
Just let it go.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.627
Let it go.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.710
You know what the simple
answer is, Charles?

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.095
I just don't have any way
to turn him away.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.559
I'll go to turkana.

01:16:54.401 --> 01:16:55.937
But I'm not resigning.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.566
I'm not giving in to them.

01:17:18.843 --> 01:17:21.505
- Karibu.
- Asante.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.253
Tell me your mind.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.304
I go with you to turkana.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.810
I'll go to school there.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.972
No, thanks, maruge.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.311
I don't want any more battles.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.101
Turkana is far.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.191
What about your husband?

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:44.152
He'll stay in Nairobi.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:46.567
He's very busy.

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:50.203
We've been apart so much
we're used to it, yeah?

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:53.995
You're suffering because of me.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.580
No.

01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:57.290
It's my decision.

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:03.167
I think I'm too old to learn.

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:08.555
My father had a saying.

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:10.887
He wasn't an educated man.

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:13.017
He was a fisherman.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.475
But he said,

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:20.393
"learning never ends until
you have got soil in your ears."

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:24.689
What was your father's tribe?

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.823
Kisii.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.453
From the lakes.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:33.160
Good people.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:43.253
Wow!

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.509
That was a long time ago!

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.422
A handsome man, maruge!

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:54.893
And your wife, she's very beautiful.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:58.852
Yes.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.273
Thank you for the tea, maruge.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:13.613
I will see you tomorrow for my last day.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:24.089
You know, my mother
never went to school.

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:26.545
But she said to me,

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.963
"Jane, you must love education,

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:34.053
"because I want you
to be better than me."

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:36.935
Now, I am your mother,

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:40.815
and I am telling you all

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:44.819
you must love education...

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.105
So that you can be better than me

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.447
and all of us teachers here.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.032
- Si ndiyo?
- Ndiyo.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.037
Good.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:00.209
Some of us have bought gifts
for teacher Jane.

01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:03.162
Can I see them?

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.721
Ok, faith. Would you like to start us off?

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:33.655
Oh!

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:45.875
A bracelet! Thank you so much.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:48.336
These are just for you, teacher Jane.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:53.546
Have you seen maruge?

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:56.716
No, I haven't seen him.

01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:39.925
- Good morning, children.
- Good morning, sir.

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:41.810
Children, I am Mr. Kipruto,

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.472
and I'm pleased to announce the
appointment of the new head teacher,

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:49.269
the new mwalimu mkuu,
who will take the place of teacher Jane.

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:53.655
The new head teacher has shown
loyalty and dedication

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.407
to the education of children

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.569
and we feel is greatly deserving
of this promotion.

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:05.584
I expect you to show your full support
for Mrs. Grace muthumba.

01:22:06.713 --> 01:22:08.453
She'll be joining us this afternoon.

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:12.045
So in the meantime,
I'll be standing in her place.

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:17.009
I used to be a teacher.
So we'll have fun, right?

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:18.262
Yes.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:25.388
Alright, children. And then you've got
class. And then you've got class.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.729
No running! No running, no running,
no running, no running.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:31.523
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.329
I need to go to the city.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.900
You're going to the city? Let's go.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.034
- That's my fare.
- What?

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:50.124
What am I going to do
with a goat, maruge?

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.664
You can breed more goats.

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:54.629
- Oh, come on, maruge.
- I've got to get to the city quickly.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:58.421
That's not fair. Maruge, next time
you need to get hard cash.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:01.591
Free education is
messing you up, maruge.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.355
She's here!

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:29.243
Hello! So many faces.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.029
Come on.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.296
You get the padlock.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.298
Faster, faster, faster.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.676
Move back!

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.884
Go back. Go back, go back.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:56.796
Ok, throw. Throw!

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:04.880
We want teacher Jane!
We want teacher Jane!

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:08.721
We want teacher Jane!
We want teacher Jane!

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.447
Teacher Jane!

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:29.580
Maruge, your damn goat
is peeing on everyone here!

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.662
Hey, what's that? You're an idiot
for going back to school.

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:34.792
This celebrity culture
has gone too far now!

01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:49.675
You, stop that, now.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:53.345
No! Look at them! I can't
handle such indiscipline!

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.730
They're just... little children!
They're just little...

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.266
Hey, we can take care of them!

01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:00.607
- No!
- Grace, please!

01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:02.442
They're just little kids!

01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:08.953
We want teacher Jane!
We want teacher Jane!

01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:16.997
Sorry!

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:20.084
Grace!

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.666
Grace!

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:37.852
Wow, karibu!
This is where everybody is.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.921
But don't worry, we have
a better place, alright?

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:43.153
There's no demonstration. So many
people are doing their business, maruge.

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:44.813
Watch out, watch out!

01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:47.983
When you get lost here,
just raise your ID.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.823
Wah-wah! Nairobi, here we come.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.533
This is Nairobi!

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.570
Got the old guy
from the education campaign

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.406
here with me in reception.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.366
He wants to see the chairman.

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.451
Ok, thanks.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.117
Excuse me. The chairman is busy.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.537
Would you like to see
the deputy chairman?

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:43.671
- No.
- Oh... alright.

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:45.282
Then I'm afraid you'll have to wait.

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:46.921
I don't want to wait.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.585
You're gonna have to.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.762
Hey, jacquie, I need the chairman
to sign this.

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:55.391
No, sorry, he's in a meeting
and I cannot disturb him.

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.177
But I need it right now.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:28:00.267
Ok, do this... leave it with me,
then I'll see what I can do.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:02.728
- Ok, but make it asap.
- Sure.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.825
Hey, sir! Wait! Please wait!

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:16.955
So, where do we go from here?

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.537
Mr. Chairman, I still insist
that we should go to kilifi.

01:28:25.008 --> 01:28:26.999
We have the money!

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.088
Wait, sir!

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:31.127
Old man, you can't go in...

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:35.599
I am so sorry, Mr. Chairman.

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:37.134
I'm gonna go and call security.

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:39.098
What is this?

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:41.888
Sir, this is mzee maruge.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:45.104
Mr. Maruge.
What can we do for you?

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:47.143
I'm here for a teacher.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.904
- Sir, shall I...
- No, that's alright. Thank you.

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.112
You have our attention, sir.

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:57.620
I was in the detention camps
with our founding fathers.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:03.668
These men sacrificed everything
for your generation.

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.501
Without them, you'd not be here.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:10.588
Before, it was only
the queen's face there.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:55.045
The British did this to me.

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.716
They cracked my skull.

01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:04.346
They chopped off my toes.

01:30:04.524 --> 01:30:06.185
Mr. Chairman...

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:10.728
Mr. Maruge, that's enough.

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:19.945
We have to learn from our past.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.114
We must not forget.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.829
But we must be better.

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.958
We need good teachers.

01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:35.086
We reap what we sow with our children.

01:30:38.308 --> 01:30:40.139
Bring her back.

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:52.527
Thank you.

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:46.804
Welcome back.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:06.445
- Who is it?
- It's teacher Jane!

01:33:06.623 --> 01:33:10.081
Teacher! Teacher Jane is here.
Can we go to her?

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:28.384
Welcome back!

01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:30.677
Oh, we missed you so much.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.516
Welcome!

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:40.649
Welcome back!

01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:57.377
Ohh!

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:07.430
I hear you have been writing.
Is it true you have been writing?

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.057
Alright, back to class! Ok, come.

01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:14.938
Let's go back to class.

01:34:22.782 --> 01:34:24.773
I hope you're back for good.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:27.964
Ok, so let's decide
which books are going...

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:30.328
Yes, maruge?

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.705
- We're busy, maruge.
- No, it's ok.

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:38.371
The letter. 'Tis too hard.
You must read it for me now.

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.254
Please.

01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:45.673
Come, maruge.

01:35:07.952 --> 01:35:09.783
You read it for maruge.

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:14.538
Sit down, maruge.

01:35:27.639 --> 01:35:31.052
"Dear honoured prisoner number 4339,

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:34.218
"on behalf of the republic of Kenya

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:38.604
"I would like to inform you that you have
been judged eligible for compensation

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:44.611
"for the ill-treatment you endured while
imprisoned under British colonial rule

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:48.820

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:59.918

01:36:00.088 --> 01:36:04.752
"and embakasi camp

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:22.599
"It is recorded hereby

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:26.395

"With gratitude for your heroic sacrifice

"his excellency, the president
of the republic of Kenya."

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.466
We're here because of you, maruge.

01:37:05.278 --> 01:37:06.893
Shall we go, maruge?

01:37:13.453 --> 01:37:15.535
This is not the end, you know?

01:37:15.705 --> 01:37:17.787
I want to continue learning.

01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:20.323
I want to become a vet.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:23.163
A vet, maruge?

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.829
But you know you'll be
about 100 years old?

01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:28.965
I'll learn until I have
soil in my ears.

01:37:29.135 --> 01:37:32.844
Yes, maruge. You will. You will.

01:39:01.477 --> 01:39:03.809
My people, my people,

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:06.141
teacher, my teacher, wow!

01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:09.307
Now, word has spread, officially,

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:13.819
that kimani ng'ang'a maruge
has actually made it all the way

01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:17.482
to the United States of America
all by himself,

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:21.073
speaking to the UN,
to talk to the politicians.

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:23.454
This is unbelievable!

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.990
I... I cannot even...

01:39:26.169 --> 01:39:29.707
Maruge in the United States,
speaking to the UN!

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:31.496
Can you... can you believe that?

01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:35.633
You know, I'm now...
I'm now beginning to believe

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:40.263
that one day, a Kenyan...
A Kenyan! ...Will go to the white house.

01:39:40.433 --> 01:39:43.470
But for now... according to me,

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:48.013
kimani maruge is
the headmaster of the world!

01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:49.727
Yes, we can!
