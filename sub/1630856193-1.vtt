00:09.134 --> 00:12.262
From Balaban Films
comes the laugh and love

00:12.303 --> 00:14.389
riot of the holiday season--

00:14.431 --> 00:18.393
William West's His Merry Wife!

00:18.435 --> 00:22.272
Claude Lancaster as James,
a lovelorn man in need

00:22.313 --> 00:25.567
of a little Christmas magic.

00:25.608 --> 00:30.613
Ava Hayward as Rebecca,
the woman he loves.

00:30.655 --> 00:34.200
And introducing Jack
Huston as Charlie,

00:34.242 --> 00:37.579
a guardian angel tasked
with reuniting the two.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.207
An angel?

00:41.249 --> 00:42.584
Well, that depends
on you, my friend.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.793
I am here to help.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.587
Now, tell me.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.713
What's this about a girl?

00:46.755 --> 00:47.589
[chuckles]

00:48.798 --> 00:50.800
We were meant to be married.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.218
I fouled it up.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.428
I'd need a miracle to
make things right again.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.430
Well, lucky for you,
it's Christmas time,

00:55.472 --> 00:57.599
and there's a miracle
around every corner, pal.

00:57.640 --> 00:58.558
[chuckles]

00:58.600 --> 01:00.894
Now where is this girl?

01:00.935 --> 01:02.479
There she is.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.315
[light music]

01:08.985 --> 01:10.320
Rebecca.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.698
Say, what kind of
game are you playing?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.575
You've helped lost
souls before, Charlie.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.827
And you know good and well
why this time is different.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.954
She's my wife.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.332
Maybe in another life.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.584
But tonight, she's
your assignment.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.502
[scoffs]

01:28.963 --> 01:31.216
A picture for the ages.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.594
Our gift to you,
our merry viewer.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.889
[bright music]

01:44.854 --> 01:46.856
Ms. Hardgrove?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.274
Mr. Balaban see you now.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.495
[phone rings in background]

02:05.834 --> 02:06.835
[chuckles]

02:09.337 --> 02:12.007
You've changed the ending.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.259
Charlie is supposed to
pass up on his wings

02:14.300 --> 02:16.136
and help James get the girl.

02:16.177 --> 02:19.347
But instead, you have
him, what, watch Rebecca

02:19.389 --> 02:21.891
as she drives out through
the tall iron gates

02:21.933 --> 02:23.435
and into an uncertain future?

02:23.476 --> 02:24.102
Yes.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.770
It's real life.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.063
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.983
Leave real life for
reality TV shows.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.651
This is a Christmas movie.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.030
Yes, it is, but I think we have
a chance right now to bring

02:35.071 --> 02:37.490
His Merry Wife! into
the 21st century

02:37.532 --> 02:40.702
and give audiences something
modern and something real.

02:40.744 --> 02:45.165
Lucy, the title has
an exclamation point.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.291
Would you like a peppermint?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.917
No, thank you.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.671
You know, every other studio
passed on His Merry Wife!

02:51.713 --> 02:55.091
But my grandfather, Harold
Balaban, saw the potential,

02:55.133 --> 02:58.428
knew that it had all the
makings for a classic.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.597
Right, and I love a classic.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.057
I'm all for honoring
the original version.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.850
Good.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.518
It's just that we are living
in a different time period now,

03:05.560 --> 03:08.730
and I think this generation
would want its own voice.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.195
My grandfather actually took
me with him to Biltmore when

03:15.236 --> 03:17.030
he decided to visit the set.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.699
I had to be, I don't know, all
of about seven at the time.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.035
I'll tell you, there's
something really

03:22.077 --> 03:24.329
special about that place.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.374
So maybe what you need is
to see it for yourself.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.125
Let's send you
down to Asheville.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.378
Oh.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.045
OK.

03:32.087 --> 03:32.962
Good.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.297
You're going tomorrow.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.924
Oh, well, Christmas
is in a few days.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.217
So--
That's even better.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.469
You get to see the
place all lit up.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.679
OK.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.471
Mr. Balaban--

03:41.513 --> 03:42.097
No.

03:42.138 --> 03:42.972
Michael, please.

03:43.014 --> 03:43.848
Michael.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.392
Michael.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.186
I'm just-- I'm really
not sure how to write

03:48.228 --> 03:50.271
something I don't believe.

03:50.313 --> 03:54.984
[chuckles] Lucy, I
like you, and I think

03:55.026 --> 03:56.569
you have a lot of promise.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.906
But I also need a writer
who's on the same page.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.241
OK?

04:01.282 --> 04:03.076
Now, Sandy will get
you all the notes,

04:03.118 --> 04:04.369
take care of your travel plans.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.579
You just go to Biltmore,
have a good time.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.455
Thanks.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.748
Good.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.666
Oh, and, Lucy, Lucy.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.417
Yes.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.419
I want a happy ending.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.253
OK?

04:13.294 --> 04:16.798
[light playful music]

04:16.840 --> 04:19.759
[gentle music]

04:22.262 --> 04:24.514
I wish it were different.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.433
For a moment, you
made me so very happy.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.611
What are you doing, James?

04:38.653 --> 04:39.988
Go after her.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.116
Wouldn't change
a thing, Charlie.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.994
She's in love with a memory.

04:46.036 --> 04:46.911
I never stood a chance.

04:54.336 --> 04:58.548
Thank you for all of your help.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.137
Help?

05:04.179 --> 05:06.431
Is that what you gave him?

05:06.473 --> 05:09.059
I'm so sorry.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.186
I was selfish.

05:11.227 --> 05:16.816
Just give me another
chance to try to fix it.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.110
I'm afraid there's no time
for second chances now.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.494
You know the rules, Charlie.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.954
Christmas is almost over.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
I don't care.

05:31.998 --> 05:36.336
If you leave, you can
forget about those wings.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.879
(BOTH) I never did like to fly.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.259
What, I'm invested.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.845
The guy spends the whole movie
trying to break those two up

05:45.887 --> 05:47.514
and then suddenly
has a change of heart

05:47.555 --> 05:48.932
in the last 10 minutes.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.475
Yeah, it's romantic.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.893
It's convenient.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.478
Oh.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.689
You used to love this
movie when we were little.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.316
You could practically
recite it from memory.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.068
It's sappy.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.238
He loves her, and he knows
it will make her happy.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.948
And we know that when
push comes to shove,

06:04.989 --> 06:06.866
people will always choose
their own happiness.

06:06.908 --> 06:11.079
OK, well, that is just the
cynical, tortured writer

06:11.121 --> 06:12.622
side of you.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.542
Some people really do
get a happily ever after.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.172
So what are you going
to do about your script?

06:21.214 --> 06:22.841
I don't know, man.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.801
My career's been on life support
for the last three years.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.553
I don't know that an
opportunity like this

06:26.594 --> 06:27.804
is going to come around again.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.514
I think I just have
to figure it out.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.558
Do you think you're going
to be back by New Year's?

06:31.599 --> 06:34.060
There's just somebody
I want you to meet.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.020
No, Becca.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.980
He's perfect for you.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.273
You say that every time.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.942
Because it's true
almost every time.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.611
And you never, ever give
these guys a chance.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.572
Jack Huston could walked
through this door,

06:45.613 --> 06:47.407
and you would find
something wrong with him.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.076
[laughs] That's not true.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.455
Come on, you just have to
put yourself out there.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.374
I'm just going to spare
myself the heartache.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.627
Hey, you deserve a
really great guy who

06:59.669 --> 07:02.297
will sweep you off your feet.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.049
I like my feet right
where they are.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.926
Plus, I have someone else's
happiness to worry about.

07:06.968 --> 07:07.761
[sighs]

07:07.802 --> 07:09.304
[light music]

07:09.346 --> 07:10.889
We're going to
miss you this year,

07:10.930 --> 07:14.059
and, you know, Dad promised
that he would go caroling.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.060
Oh, yay.

07:15.101 --> 07:15.935
I need a video of that.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.687
OK.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.189
And please try to get some
Christmas spirit before you're

07:19.230 --> 07:21.149
visited by three pushy ghosts.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.275
Pff, never.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.777
[laughs] OK, Merry Christmas.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.445
I miss you.
Call me when you're back.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.196
OK.
OK.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.530
[kisses]

07:27.572 --> 07:30.617
[gentle music]

07:32.035 --> 07:33.578
[sighs]

07:35.997 --> 07:38.208
Bah, humbug.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.169
[bright music]

07:53.056 --> 07:55.975
[chatter]

07:57.185 --> 07:57.936
Ms. Hardgrove?

07:57.977 --> 07:59.354
Hi.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.814
Welcome to the inn of
the Biltmore Estate.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.523
Lucy.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.191
Oh, Winston.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.651
We're so happy to have you here.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.403
If you walk this way, I'll
show you to your room.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.321
OK.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.740
You know, William West visited
Biltmore when he was writing

08:10.782 --> 08:12.701
the original His Merry Wife!

08:12.742 --> 08:15.495
Hopefully we can be a
similar inspiration to you.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.914
Here you go, your room, 359.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.040
Thank you so much.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.542
After you've had a
chance to settle in,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.252
I'd love if you could
join me for the evening

08:22.293 --> 08:23.253
tour of Biltmore House.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.005
Oh, thank you.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.881
I think I'm probably just going
to sleep off some jet lag.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.467
I think it'll be
worth your time.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.344
It starts in an hour.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.556
[soft, light music]

09:12.594 --> 09:16.097
[crickets chirping]

09:16.139 --> 09:18.433
Christmas at Biltmore
is a tradition that

09:18.475 --> 09:21.895
goes all the way back to 1895.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.772
And we go to great
lengths to try to recreate

09:23.813 --> 09:25.482
that same magic every year.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.567
Our guests tell us
that they sometimes

09:27.609 --> 09:32.322
feel as if they've been
transported to another time.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.656
Next up is the billiards room.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.991
Come this way.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.911
[light music]

09:37.952 --> 09:41.039
I can tell by the expressions
on your face that some of you

09:41.081 --> 09:42.749
recognize this room.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.002
What holiday classic
was shot at Biltmore?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.587
His Merry Wife!

09:47.629 --> 09:50.340
You are correct.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.758
Right this way.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.428
Principal photography
began December of 1947

09:55.470 --> 09:56.763
right here at Biltmore.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.598
And many pieces
from our collection

09:58.640 --> 10:01.476
were incorporated into the film.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.938
This banquet table you may
remember from the famous dinner

10:04.979 --> 10:06.231
party scene.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.649
[shutter clicks]

10:08.650 --> 10:10.276
No flash photography, please.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.154
[light music]

10:18.410 --> 10:20.995
Right this way.

10:21.037 --> 10:25.250
Here, we have the gown worn
by Ava Hayward in the film's

10:25.291 --> 10:26.835
emotional conclusion.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.461
You know, Hayward
wasn't the studio's

10:28.503 --> 10:30.171
first choice to play Rebecca.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.632
In fact, at this point in time,
she was sort of considered box

10:32.674 --> 10:34.092
office poison.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.513
However, writer-director
Williams West cast her,

10:38.555 --> 10:40.724
it revived her
career, and she went

10:40.765 --> 10:44.477
on to win two Academy Awards.

10:44.519 --> 10:47.313
And here we have Mr.
Claude Lancaster,

10:47.355 --> 10:48.940
Hollywood's Mr. Nice Guy.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.818
He brought the star
power to this project.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.738
People say that he was
just as nice in person.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.825
Jack Huston was a relative
newcomer with just a couple

10:58.867 --> 11:00.535
of credits to his name.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.997
Funny story-- he took a bit
part in a musical called Meet Me

11:04.039 --> 11:06.708
in Poughkeepsie so he could
get on to the lot and meet

11:06.750 --> 11:09.669
the studio head, Harold
Balaban, who he convinced

11:09.711 --> 11:11.504
to get an audition for--

Sadly, Jack passed
away and wasn't

11:15.800 --> 11:18.511
able to enjoy the tremendous
success of the film.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.764
He died the following Christmas.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.932
Anyway, thank you
very much for coming.

Thank you.

--our grand library.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.340
It looks exactly the same.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.716
I know.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.593
You keep the prop on
display all year round?

11:58.635 --> 12:01.012
Actually, the hourglass
is not a prop.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
It comes from Biltmore's
private collection.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.265
Oh.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.267
William West was so
taken with it that he

12:06.309 --> 12:07.227
wrote it into the script.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.269
Hmm.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.729
It's cracked.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.898
So that happened during filming.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.608
Luckily, they were
able to repair it.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.236
All it's got is that
little infringement now.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.987
It's usually in a safe
vault, but I had it

12:18.029 --> 12:19.698
brought out especially for you.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.242
I thought you might like to see
it in person before it leaves.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.535
Leaves?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.994
It's being loaned
to the Smithsonian

12:25.036 --> 12:26.496
as part of their Golden Age
of Hollywood exhibition.

it's the studio.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.009
Great.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.635
I'm happy to hear it because
we were hoping to see

an earlier date.

a fast turnaround,

13:03.658 --> 13:05.660
Thank you, Mr. Balaban.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.746
I will do my best to
get you what you need.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.875
It is a very short time frame.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.503
But I will get it to you.

Whisk?

22:05.825 --> 22:07.660
And I'll tell her that
you'll buy her a house.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.204
Buy us a house of our own.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.580
A house?

22:10.622 --> 22:12.624
Tell her that you'll
fill it with roses.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.668
And fill it with roses.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.002
Roses?

22:16.044 --> 22:18.213
One for every day since
you walked into my life.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.048
Oh, that's a nice touch, kid.

22:20.090 --> 22:23.134
Well, that'd be grand if I
weren't allergic to them.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.594
Mmm.

22:24.636 --> 22:25.804
Sorry about that, old sport.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.514
I thought that was
right on the money.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.851
And cut.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.978
Oh, stop stepping on
my line, sweetheart.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.188
My apologies.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.106
Next time, I'll
aim for your feet.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.107
[groans]

22:39.359 --> 22:40.360
Hmm.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.237
[playful music]

22:44.197 --> 22:46.324
Thank you, Peggy.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.909
Hi, there.

22:47.951 --> 22:48.576
Hi.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.869
I'm Jack Huston.

22:53.123 --> 22:55.834
You got a name?

22:55.875 --> 22:56.835
Oh, Sandra.

22:56.876 --> 22:57.711
Sandra.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.254
Sandra?

22:59.295 --> 23:00.797
Bullock.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.925
Well, Ms. Bullock, it's
nice to meet you, again.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.719
Yeah.
Now, look at this.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.512
It's been 10 seconds, and you
haven't bolted for the door.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.347
So I'd say we're already
off to a better start.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.807
Oh, I've been here too long.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.517
Do you have somewhere
that you need to be?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.685
You could say that.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.061
Well, I did say that.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.022
Did you see where that
security guard went?

23:17.063 --> 23:18.023
Yeah, he went that way.

23:18.064 --> 23:18.857
Great.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.651
Oh.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.403
Hey, hold this for me, Gus.

23:23.445 --> 23:26.322
[slinking music]

23:28.700 --> 23:32.120
[tense music]

23:32.162 --> 23:34.914
Ms. Bullock, what was with
the disappearing act earlier?

23:34.956 --> 23:36.332
Don't they need you
for the next scene?

23:36.374 --> 23:37.876
Nah.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.127
They're filming the
final scene of the movie.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.253
Well, last time I
checked, you were in that.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.212
[laughs] That's news to me.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.172
What do you mean?

23:42.213 --> 23:43.214
Whoa, watch your head.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.549
What do you mean?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.426
No, Charlie gives up
a chance at his wings,

23:46.468 --> 23:48.053
he chases Rebecca
out into the garden,

23:48.094 --> 23:49.804
they share a final goodbye,
and she reunites with James.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.097
That's the end of the movie.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.224
No, that's not the
script that I read.

23:53.266 --> 23:54.392
It's not?
No.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.061
But what made you say that?

23:56.102 --> 23:58.521
Because I've been thinking of
something along those lines,

23:58.563 --> 23:59.939
and nobody will go for it.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.316
I am Sandra.

24:01.358 --> 24:04.194
[tense music]

24:08.615 --> 24:10.658
I'm starting to think it's me.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.745
[light upbeat music]

24:24.214 --> 24:25.757
She said she was an actress.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.592
Well, where did she go?

24:27.634 --> 24:30.637
[tense music]

24:36.267 --> 24:37.310
[gasps]

24:43.566 --> 24:47.237
You-- how-- where
did you come from?

24:47.278 --> 24:50.323
I can explain.

24:50.365 --> 24:51.574
No, I can't.

24:51.616 --> 24:54.869
You weren't there.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.247
And then you were there.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.289
What are you wearing?

24:58.331 --> 25:00.500
[stammers] Why are you here?

25:00.542 --> 25:01.626
Well, you were so upset.

25:01.668 --> 25:02.961
I was worried.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.296
You said you'd be
right back, and you

25:05.338 --> 25:06.464
were gone almost an hour.

25:06.506 --> 25:07.257
An hour.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.341
An hour!

25:08.383 --> 25:09.634
OK.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.177
Hey, is that the
one from the movie?

25:11.219 --> 25:12.971
Yeah, don't touch it.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.472
Why not?

25:14.514 --> 25:16.975
Ladies, I'm sorry, we're about
to close up for the night.

25:17.017 --> 25:17.600
Oh.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.102
Sorry.

25:19.144 --> 25:22.397
I just was here to take
photos of the hourglass

25:22.439 --> 25:23.815
for my research.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.275
And I'm sure we'll be
able to accommodate you

25:25.316 --> 25:27.152
during the appropriate hours.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.194
Sure, sure.
Yeah.

25:28.236 --> 25:29.029
Sorry.

25:30.989 --> 25:33.033
By the way, I love this costume.

25:33.074 --> 25:33.867
Oh.

25:33.908 --> 25:34.784
Straight out of the movie.

25:34.826 --> 25:37.120
[laughs] Yeah.

25:37.162 --> 25:38.580
It's funny.

25:38.621 --> 25:40.623
Hey, you've been running
the His Merry Wife! tour

25:40.665 --> 25:41.624
for quite some time, right?

25:41.666 --> 25:43.126
I have.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.003
So you must know a bit
about the obscure trivia

25:45.045 --> 25:46.838
surrounding the production.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.048
Yes.

25:48.089 --> 25:49.841
Are you thinking of
something specific?

25:49.883 --> 25:52.719
Have you heard anything
about an alternate ending?

25:52.761 --> 25:54.304
There were rumors.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.513
Nothing substantiated.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.057
What kind of rumors?

25:57.098 --> 26:02.479
Well, that it was more
somber, something bittersweet.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.564
What happened to that?
Why did William West change it?

26:04.606 --> 26:05.565
Did the studio step in?

26:05.607 --> 26:06.691
No one knows.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.318
I don't think we'll ever know.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.945
Everyone involved with that
production has passed on.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.782
I think that ending
is lost to history.

26:13.823 --> 26:16.910
[soft music]

26:19.746 --> 26:20.663
[sobbing]

26:20.705 --> 26:22.123
Please.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.792
Rebecca, it's all my
fault. You have to stop.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.509
Charlie.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.053
How?

26:35.095 --> 26:36.721
You can see me?

26:36.763 --> 26:38.056
Just for now, Charlie.

26:38.098 --> 26:40.141
[soft music]

26:40.183 --> 26:42.936
Well, then we don't
have much time.

26:42.977 --> 26:44.562
And I want you to
know that I love you,

26:44.604 --> 26:46.231
and I have always loved you.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.359
And I don't want to be the
thing that's holding you back.

26:49.401 --> 26:52.445
The greatest gift that you can
give me is to live your life

26:52.487 --> 26:54.280
and find a little happiness.

26:57.867 --> 27:04.624
Now, he's a little stiff.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.542
But you could do worse.

27:10.630 --> 27:14.175
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

27:14.217 --> 27:15.260
Merry Christmas.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.179
[light music]

27:49.961 --> 27:53.465
[inquisitive music]

28:09.731 --> 28:11.691
Lucy, I hope you
can join us tonight

28:11.733 --> 28:12.942
for the gift-giving event.

28:12.984 --> 28:15.111
It's been a tradition
here since 1895.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.822
Did you know on the first
Christmas Biltmore opened

28:17.864 --> 28:19.824
its doors, it was to
the employees' families

28:19.866 --> 28:22.535
in the spirit of
generosity, gratitude?

28:22.577 --> 28:26.498
And there was a handpicked gift
under the tree for each child

28:26.539 --> 28:27.624
and staff member.

28:27.665 --> 28:28.792
That's a lovely tradition.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.126
Yes, it is.

28:30.168 --> 28:31.628
Did you also know
that the hourglass

28:31.670 --> 28:33.755
was gifted to the Biltmore
collection that very same

28:33.797 --> 28:34.547
Christmas?

28:34.589 --> 28:35.882
Yes.

28:35.924 --> 28:38.343
Speaking of that
hourglass, you mentioned

28:38.385 --> 28:40.136
that you had other
props and costumes

28:40.178 --> 28:41.513
from the movie in storage.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.264
There's not enough room
to put them all out.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.557
Right.

28:44.599 --> 28:45.892
Could I possibly take a
look at some of those?

28:45.934 --> 28:48.186
I'm not sure it's
worth your while.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.063
It's mostly extras'
costumes, and they've

28:50.105 --> 28:51.314
been in mothballs for years.

28:51.356 --> 28:52.023
Please.

28:52.065 --> 28:53.274
Sure.
Come on.

28:53.316 --> 28:53.942
OK.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.194
[slinking music]

28:56.236 --> 28:59.698
[light string music]

29:02.367 --> 29:05.704
[playful music]

29:07.497 --> 29:08.289
OK.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.673
Ah.

29:16.715 --> 29:18.008
I'll pay you back.

29:18.049 --> 29:19.259
Scout's honor.

29:22.303 --> 29:25.348
You know, I knew that outfit
you were wearing last night

29:25.390 --> 29:26.558
looked familiar.

29:26.599 --> 29:29.936
And then I remembered
where I saw it.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.855
It was on the tour.

29:31.896 --> 29:33.314
But here's the funny part.

29:33.356 --> 29:36.317
It was still there this
morning on display.

29:36.359 --> 29:40.238
You appeared out
of thin air wearing

29:40.280 --> 29:42.407
clothes from another time.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.909
There can only be
one explanation.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.454
[tense music]

29:47.495 --> 29:48.872
You're a ghost.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.206
I'm not a ghost.

29:50.248 --> 29:51.875
And you're trapped
here at Christmas

29:51.916 --> 29:53.335
with unfinished business.

29:53.376 --> 29:56.379
I'm literally holding
something in my hand.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.589
I can help.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.258
If you need to get a
grave message to a loved

30:00.300 --> 30:03.303
one or right some wrong--

30:03.345 --> 30:06.473
I went back in time to 1947.

30:06.514 --> 30:07.682
What?

30:07.724 --> 30:09.434
They were filming
His Merry Wife! here,

30:09.476 --> 30:11.144
and then the costumer
thought that I

30:11.186 --> 30:12.312
was the actress playing
the candy cane girl,

30:12.354 --> 30:13.730
so they put me in that outfit.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.690
But then I came back.

30:15.732 --> 30:17.817
And it was really weird.

30:17.859 --> 30:18.902
Oh.
I know.

30:18.943 --> 30:19.861
I know.
Hold on.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.237
Here.
You all right?

30:24.240 --> 30:25.617
How long were you there?

30:28.370 --> 30:29.704
The first time, I think I--

30:29.746 --> 30:30.830
The first time?

30:30.872 --> 30:32.374
You went back more than once?

30:32.415 --> 30:33.583
Yes.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.251
Well, I had to make
sure I wasn't crazy.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.671
[laughs] Still haven't arrived
at an answer, honestly.

30:37.712 --> 30:40.340
Is that why you're looking
through the old wardrobes?

30:40.382 --> 30:42.092
Are you planning to go back?

30:42.133 --> 30:44.344
Yeah, I got something
I got to do.

30:44.386 --> 30:46.054
This is unbelievable, right?

30:46.096 --> 30:47.472
How did this even happen?

30:47.514 --> 30:49.599
The hourglass was sitting
there, I turned it over,

30:49.641 --> 30:50.725
and it brought me here.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.060
I mean there but here.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.853
Before I knew it,
I was just standing

30:53.895 --> 30:57.148
there talking to Jack Huston.

30:57.190 --> 31:00.443
[gasps] Is he just as
charming in real life?

31:00.485 --> 31:03.279
[laughs] He's kind
of pushy, actually.

31:03.321 --> 31:04.489
Oh.

31:04.531 --> 31:05.198
Oh.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.199
Oh, I understand.

31:06.241 --> 31:08.785
You're going back for him.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.245
Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.205
Oh, that is just about
the most romantic

31:12.247 --> 31:13.581
thing I have ever heard.

31:13.623 --> 31:16.459
No, I promise I'm not
going back for anyone.

31:16.501 --> 31:20.380
So if you're not going
back for Jack Huston,

31:20.422 --> 31:22.966
then what are you
going back for?

31:23.008 --> 31:25.385
[soft music]

31:25.427 --> 31:27.303
I can't believe
you didn't tell me

31:27.345 --> 31:30.849
you were writing the
remake of His Merry Wife!

31:30.890 --> 31:32.434
Who's going to play Charlie?

31:32.475 --> 31:34.477
Oh, you should ask
that Ryan Reynolds.

31:34.519 --> 31:36.312
I mean, he would be perfect.

31:36.354 --> 31:38.189
He's got just the right
amount of charisma.

31:40.775 --> 31:42.861
What, what does any
of this have to do

31:42.902 --> 31:44.696
with you going back in time?

31:44.738 --> 31:47.032
Well, I have to find out what
was in that original ending

31:47.073 --> 31:48.533
and why they changed it.

31:51.536 --> 31:52.454
["HARK!

32:18.438 --> 32:21.649
Join the triumph of the skies.

32:21.691 --> 32:28.865
Hark, the herald angels sing,
glory to the newborn king.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.706
You look great.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.041
What are you doing here?

32:38.083 --> 32:39.709
I'm your backup.

32:39.751 --> 32:41.086
My backup?

32:41.127 --> 32:42.754
Well, I just thought
that in case something

32:42.796 --> 32:45.757
goes wrong on this end,
you might need somebody.

32:45.799 --> 32:47.092
Oh, no, that's OK.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.426
It's your Christmas vacation.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.095
You should go enjoy it.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.888
Are you kidding?

32:51.930 --> 32:54.057
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

32:54.099 --> 32:54.933
OK.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.393
So how's this work?

32:56.434 --> 32:59.688
So when I turned the
hourglass the first time,

32:59.729 --> 33:02.315
there were only a few minutes of
sand left, which is why I think

33:02.357 --> 33:03.608
my first trip was so short.

33:03.650 --> 33:07.070
But the second time,
I got the full hour.

33:07.112 --> 33:09.656
So you'll only be gone an hour.

33:09.698 --> 33:12.075
Barring any unforeseen
circumstances.

33:12.117 --> 33:14.327
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

33:14.369 --> 33:16.538
I mean, what if you change
something in the past?

33:16.579 --> 33:18.081
Won't that affect the future?

33:18.123 --> 33:19.499
It's going to be fine.

33:19.541 --> 33:21.501
What if somebody suspects you?

33:21.543 --> 33:23.670
Well, I've seen His Girl
Friday like a dozen times.

33:23.712 --> 33:26.089
I think if I just throw in a
buster here and a fella there,

33:26.131 --> 33:26.965
I'll blend right in.

33:27.007 --> 33:27.841
OK.

33:27.882 --> 33:29.592
OK.

33:29.634 --> 33:32.095
Lucy?

33:32.137 --> 33:34.931
Good luck.

33:34.973 --> 33:36.433
And say hey to Jack for me.

33:39.936 --> 33:42.272
[soft foreboding music]

33:42.313 --> 33:45.400
[sand trickling]

33:49.863 --> 33:52.782
[soft shimmering music]

33:54.826 --> 33:57.704
[bright festive music]

34:08.965 --> 34:11.426
[excited screaming]

34:11.468 --> 34:12.260
Not today, ladies.

34:12.302 --> 34:13.428
Not today.

34:13.470 --> 34:15.138
Not before coffee.

34:15.180 --> 34:16.639
Well, hiya, girls.

34:16.681 --> 34:17.974
I'll sign it for if you want.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.225
I'm in the picture, too.

34:19.267 --> 34:20.977
The name is Jack Huston.

34:21.019 --> 34:21.936
Here.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.063
There you are.

34:23.104 --> 34:24.314
Ah.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.024
Mr. West, got an
idea for you, sir.

34:28.693 --> 34:32.530
And then get this, he gives up
his wings because he loves her.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.907
What do you think?

34:33.948 --> 34:35.075
I think he should stick
to saying the lines

34:35.116 --> 34:36.493
and not writing them.

34:36.534 --> 34:39.037
[chuckles humorlessly]
But you'll consider it?

34:39.079 --> 34:41.039
[whistling]

34:41.081 --> 34:44.000
[light music]

34:48.421 --> 34:51.925
[soft downbeat music]

35:05.355 --> 35:06.981
Ms Bullock?

35:07.023 --> 35:08.358
Ms. Bullock.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.401
Oh.

35:09.442 --> 35:10.652
Now, you listen here.

35:10.694 --> 35:11.778
You can't just
march up on a dame

35:11.820 --> 35:15.699
and give her the
what for, buster.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.076
Hey.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.035
Excuse me.

35:19.077 --> 35:19.869
Let go of me.

35:19.911 --> 35:21.621
I am not a piece of luggage.

35:21.663 --> 35:23.373
No, you're absolutely right.
Luggage comes with a tag.

35:23.415 --> 35:24.457
It lets you know
where it came from.

35:24.499 --> 35:26.042
Who are you?
Where are you from?

35:26.084 --> 35:28.253
We called central casting,
and no one knows who you are.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.130
Are you even Sandra Bullock?

35:30.171 --> 35:31.715
I'm Lucy Hardgrove.

35:31.756 --> 35:38.888
And you may not believe this,
but I'm from the studio.

35:38.930 --> 35:39.681
Studio?

35:39.723 --> 35:40.473
You don't say.

35:40.515 --> 35:42.225
Yes.

35:42.267 --> 35:46.604
Well, Mr. Balaban, he heard
about all the discord on set.

35:46.646 --> 35:48.106
He sent me to keep
an eye on things.

35:48.148 --> 35:49.190
Really?
Yes.

35:49.232 --> 35:50.567
He's a very busy man.

35:50.608 --> 35:52.694
Prove it.

35:52.736 --> 35:54.821
Oh, you took a bit part
in Meet Me in Poughkeepsie

35:54.863 --> 35:57.157
so that you could audition for
this part and get on the lot.

35:57.198 --> 36:00.160
[laughs] Do you know I camped
in front of that parking spot

36:00.201 --> 36:01.745
for three days?

36:01.786 --> 36:03.621
How did you know that?

36:03.663 --> 36:05.832
Well, I told you,
Mr. Balaban sent me.

36:05.874 --> 36:08.376
All right, well, obviously,
this is a misunderstanding.

36:08.418 --> 36:10.712
I apologize, Ms.
Hardgrove, and I hope

36:10.754 --> 36:12.088
there are no hard feelings.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.256
[chuckles]

36:13.298 --> 36:15.675
[chuckles] Of course not.

36:15.717 --> 36:18.762
[soft playful music]

36:23.641 --> 36:26.478
[soft foreboding music]

36:26.519 --> 36:30.023
[light music]

36:33.026 --> 36:36.363
He really doesn't
give up his wings.

36:36.404 --> 36:37.739
Ms. Hardgrove.

36:37.781 --> 36:41.326
[laughs] I just want
to introduce myself.

36:41.368 --> 36:42.494
Claude Lancaster.
I know.

36:42.535 --> 36:44.079
I'm such a fan.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.789
I just loved you in Mr.
Grayson Takes a Vacation.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.582
Oh, well, I have to
say, I've heard nothing

36:47.624 --> 36:51.419
but wonderful things about you.

36:51.461 --> 36:52.587
From whom?

36:52.629 --> 36:54.130
Well, Harold Balaban.

36:54.172 --> 36:57.467
I'm so pleased that he's
responded to my concerns.

36:57.509 --> 37:00.178
There's still time
to replace her.

37:00.220 --> 37:01.513
Replace her?

37:01.554 --> 37:02.972
Yes, it pains me
to even suggest it,

37:03.014 --> 37:06.184
but Hayward's last
three films were flops.

37:06.226 --> 37:07.811
She'll sink us.

37:07.852 --> 37:09.646
But don't you worry
your pretty little head.

37:09.688 --> 37:11.481
I have got some ideas
for who we might get.

37:11.523 --> 37:12.857
[laughs humorlessly]

37:12.899 --> 37:16.486
Took the liberty of
jotting the names down.

37:16.528 --> 37:21.366
And Mr. Balaban is
on board with this?

37:21.408 --> 37:24.077
I thought that's
why you were here.

37:24.119 --> 37:25.078
Just testing you.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.496
[chuckling]

37:26.538 --> 37:29.374
[soft, light music]

37:34.045 --> 37:34.879
Ava.

37:38.216 --> 37:42.303
You don't think they would
shut us down, do you?

37:42.345 --> 37:43.722
There'd be no reason.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.306
Besides the fact that
we're behind schedule

37:45.348 --> 37:46.641
and over budget?

37:46.683 --> 37:48.435
[chuckles softly]
Yeah, besides that.

37:48.476 --> 37:49.352
Then no.

37:49.394 --> 37:50.228
None at all.

37:50.270 --> 37:53.231
[dramatic music]

37:59.279 --> 38:02.741
[tense string music]

38:06.953 --> 38:07.746
Shoot.

38:10.623 --> 38:12.042
Hiya.
There you are.

38:12.083 --> 38:13.043
[glass shatters]

38:13.084 --> 38:14.210
Oh.

38:14.252 --> 38:15.211
No.

38:15.253 --> 38:16.338
No, no, no, no.

38:16.379 --> 38:17.589
[gasps]

38:17.630 --> 38:18.673
It's OK.

38:18.715 --> 38:19.716
I'll take the blame.

38:19.758 --> 38:22.385
I'll say it's my fault. It's OK.

38:22.427 --> 38:24.179
Get this cleaned up.

38:24.220 --> 38:27.766
[heavy music]

38:30.185 --> 38:33.480
[foreboding music]

38:55.835 --> 38:59.923
What in the world?

38:59.964 --> 39:01.341
Ah.

39:01.383 --> 39:04.260
[vibrates lips] Ma.

39:04.302 --> 39:05.220
[clears throat]

39:05.261 --> 39:06.596
Buzz off, McGee.

39:06.638 --> 39:08.515
I know what you're doing.

39:08.556 --> 39:09.891
Reading the funny pages?

39:09.933 --> 39:11.309
You've been sending
word to Mr. Balaban

39:11.351 --> 39:14.104
that there's trouble on set,
trying to muscle me out.

39:14.145 --> 39:17.273
Well, that's a one-way
ticket to the naughty list.

39:17.315 --> 39:19.401
Paranoia is an ugly
look on you, Ava.

39:19.442 --> 39:20.944
Yeah?

39:20.985 --> 39:23.446
Well, that suit's not
exactly doing you any favors.

39:23.488 --> 39:24.989
That's some crack.

39:25.031 --> 39:26.324
Yeah, but can you fix it?

39:26.366 --> 39:27.784
Not sure.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.619
I need that hourglass.

39:29.661 --> 39:31.287
For the movie-- picture.

39:31.329 --> 39:32.080
I'll do what I can.

39:32.122 --> 39:33.289
I can't make any promises.

39:39.963 --> 39:41.548
There she is.

39:41.589 --> 39:43.008
Well, that was some
spill you took.

39:43.049 --> 39:44.509
Give her some space.

39:44.551 --> 39:47.262
I hope somebody got the
license plate of that bus.

39:47.303 --> 39:48.221
She's concussed.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.305
I'm fine.

39:49.347 --> 39:50.015
Thanks.

39:50.056 --> 39:52.434
Lucy, what year is it?

39:52.475 --> 39:53.643
1947.

39:53.685 --> 39:54.644
Ah.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.271
And who's the president?

39:56.312 --> 39:57.647
Oh.

39:57.689 --> 39:58.648
Mm, yeah, we should
get her to a doctor.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.108
No, no, I know this.

40:03.194 --> 40:03.820
Truman?

40:03.862 --> 40:05.530
That a girl.

40:05.572 --> 40:06.823
Oh, where did he go?
Who?

40:06.865 --> 40:08.533
Oh, the man with the hourglass.
Gus?

40:08.575 --> 40:09.492
Where did he go?

40:09.534 --> 40:12.328
I think he went that way.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.497
Who's your friend,
and what's her hurry?

40:14.539 --> 40:15.832
Well, it's Balaban's girl.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.375
Just flew in from LA.

40:17.417 --> 40:18.209
Strange duck.

40:20.879 --> 40:22.422
Yes, she is.

40:22.464 --> 40:25.925
[light string music]

40:27.302 --> 40:28.428
An angel?

40:28.470 --> 40:30.263
Well, now that depends
on you, my friend.

40:30.305 --> 40:31.473
I am here to help.

40:31.514 --> 40:34.976
Now, what's this about a girl?

40:35.018 --> 40:36.853
We were meant to be married.

40:36.895 --> 40:38.313
I fouled it up.

40:38.355 --> 40:40.231
I'd need a miracle to
make things right again.

40:40.273 --> 40:42.484
Well, lucky for you,
it's Christmas time,

40:42.525 --> 40:44.611
and there's a miracle
around every corner, pal.

40:44.652 --> 40:45.403
[chuckles]

40:46.404 --> 40:47.739
Now where is this girl?

40:47.781 --> 40:48.573
There she is.

40:55.330 --> 40:57.540
Rebecca.

40:57.582 --> 40:58.833
And cut.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.210
We good?

41:00.251 --> 41:01.544
It's North Carolina,
not the North Pole.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.090
Gus?
Yeah.

41:05.131 --> 41:05.757
He left.

41:05.799 --> 41:06.716
He left?

41:06.758 --> 41:07.717
Is he coming back today?

41:07.759 --> 41:09.386
No.

41:09.427 --> 41:10.970
Said he needed to take the
hourglass off site after you

41:11.012 --> 41:12.347
cracked that thing like an egg.

41:12.389 --> 41:15.058
[sighs] OK.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.893
When is the call time tomorrow?

41:16.935 --> 41:17.727
It's Christmas Eve.

41:17.769 --> 41:19.688
We're off.

41:19.729 --> 41:22.941
But he should be back for
the party tomorrow night.

41:26.403 --> 41:29.739
Ava, how do I look?

41:29.781 --> 41:30.740
Up to something.

41:30.782 --> 41:32.075
Oh, no, no, no.

41:32.117 --> 41:33.576
She's a stranger in
a brand new place.

41:33.618 --> 41:35.245
I just thought she might
enjoy some company for supper.

41:35.286 --> 41:36.663
That's all.

41:36.705 --> 41:38.039
So you can sweet talk her
into a three-picture deal

41:38.081 --> 41:39.124
over martinis?

41:39.165 --> 41:41.543
[laughs] I'm a gentleman, Ava.

41:41.584 --> 41:42.669
I'm going to wait for dessert.

41:42.711 --> 41:44.462
Stop it Jack.

41:57.392 --> 41:59.644
Is this seat taken?

41:59.686 --> 42:00.979
I'm expecting someone.

42:01.021 --> 42:01.855
Ah.

42:09.487 --> 42:10.447
[sighs]

42:12.323 --> 42:15.243
What looks good?

42:15.285 --> 42:17.037
Ha, figgy pudding.

42:17.078 --> 42:19.998
Have you ever had figgy pudding?

42:20.040 --> 42:21.708
Once when I was a kid.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.668
What's in it, I wonder?

42:23.710 --> 42:25.295
Figs.

42:25.337 --> 42:26.796
Say, you don't suppose that's
where they got the name,

42:26.838 --> 42:27.672
do you?

42:30.091 --> 42:31.343
Would you care to join me?

42:31.384 --> 42:32.552
Well, if you insist.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.137
Now, you sure he won't mind?
Who?

42:34.179 --> 42:35.513
The gentleman that
you're waiting for.

42:35.555 --> 42:37.307
I'm not waiting for anyone.

42:37.349 --> 42:38.475
Gee, you don't say.

42:44.439 --> 42:50.862
Now, I hope that Mr. Balaban
knows just how grateful

42:50.904 --> 42:53.156
I am to be in this picture.

42:53.198 --> 42:54.699
And I want to assure him--

42:54.741 --> 42:56.201
thank you.

42:56.242 --> 42:58.161
And I want to assure him
that a bet on Jack Huston

42:58.203 --> 42:59.788
is a surefire winner.

42:59.829 --> 43:01.706
And you'd like me to put
in a good word for you.

43:01.748 --> 43:03.875
No, I mean, only if
you really mean it.

43:03.917 --> 43:05.251
I don't think that I need to.

43:05.293 --> 43:10.048
I think your work really
speaks for itself.

43:10.090 --> 43:13.802
I mean, a soda is a nickel here.

43:13.843 --> 43:14.886
It's not where you're from?

43:14.928 --> 43:15.970
No.

43:16.012 --> 43:17.972
And where is that exactly?

43:18.014 --> 43:18.890
Santa Monica.

43:18.932 --> 43:19.849
Oh, Santa Monica.

43:19.891 --> 43:20.934
By way of Ohio.

43:20.975 --> 43:22.310
Oh.

43:22.352 --> 43:24.229
That must be tough
being this far away

43:24.270 --> 43:26.398
from home at Christmas time.

43:26.439 --> 43:32.237
Yeah, it's definitely
not what I expected.

43:32.278 --> 43:35.281
And what would you be
doing if you weren't here?

43:35.323 --> 43:37.784
My sister and I go
caroling every Christmas.

43:37.826 --> 43:39.119
It's kind of a tradition.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.370
We hit every house
in the neighborhood

43:40.412 --> 43:43.081
until our voices are hoarse.

43:43.123 --> 43:45.792
Then we drink hot chocolate.

43:45.834 --> 43:48.503
Now that is something
that I can help with.

43:48.545 --> 43:50.505
You know a good hot
chocolate joint around here?

43:50.547 --> 43:52.757
I know a great hot
chocolate joint.

43:52.799 --> 43:53.466
All right.

43:53.508 --> 43:54.551
I'm not hungry, anyway.

43:54.592 --> 43:55.260
Let's go.

43:55.301 --> 43:58.430
[light festive music]

44:09.274 --> 44:11.109
Well, what about you?

44:11.151 --> 44:13.403
Any Christmas traditions?

44:13.445 --> 44:16.781
Well, we didn't have a
lot when I was growing up.

44:16.823 --> 44:19.075
But my father, who
worked at a factory,

44:19.117 --> 44:21.870
made sure that he'd always saved
enough money to take my mother

44:21.911 --> 44:24.789
and I to a nickelodeon on
Christmas Day every year.

44:24.831 --> 44:26.499
And my mother
would always insist

44:26.541 --> 44:28.960
that I choose the picture,
and I always chose a comedy

44:29.002 --> 44:31.338
because they were her favorite.

44:31.379 --> 44:35.342
And I would sit in
that dark theater,

44:35.383 --> 44:39.429
light dancing in her
eyes, watching her laugh.

44:39.471 --> 44:41.806
And that was the
best Christmas gift.

44:41.848 --> 44:43.725
Is that why you wanted
to become an actor?

44:43.767 --> 44:45.393
It sure is, yeah.

44:45.435 --> 44:47.604
I started out as a stunt man.

44:47.645 --> 44:52.067
I had a job on a cowboy
picture called Wagons West.

44:52.108 --> 44:55.153
And the actor got bucked off
the pony, and I fit the chaps.

44:55.195 --> 44:56.446
I got a promotion.

44:56.488 --> 45:00.867
I got two lines, which
I still remember.

45:00.909 --> 45:03.203
"He ain't lying, sheriff.

45:03.244 --> 45:05.497
The horse belongs
to Billy the Kid."

45:05.538 --> 45:09.000
[laughs] That was you?

45:09.042 --> 45:09.876
So you've seen it?

45:09.918 --> 45:11.461
Yes, I've seen it.

45:11.503 --> 45:12.962
I watch a ton of Turner Classic
Movies and the Criterion

45:13.004 --> 45:14.506
Collection and--

45:14.547 --> 45:15.757
You lost me, bright eyes.

45:15.799 --> 45:19.636
I'll need a map to
find my way back.

45:19.678 --> 45:23.014
That's always been my dream,
to be up on that silver screen,

45:23.056 --> 45:24.265
to see my name in lights.

45:24.307 --> 45:25.600
Mm.

45:25.642 --> 45:28.019
Yeah, really make your
mark in the world.

45:28.061 --> 45:29.771
Yeah.

45:29.813 --> 45:32.315
So I hope your boss can
find it in his heart to keep

45:32.357 --> 45:33.858
this movie up and running.

45:33.900 --> 45:35.694
I've got a very good feeling
about this little picture.

45:35.735 --> 45:38.780
I think it's going
to be the one.

45:38.822 --> 45:40.115
Mm.

45:40.156 --> 45:46.204
Now, who are you really?

45:46.246 --> 45:47.872
What do you mean?

45:47.914 --> 45:49.499
Well, nobody hoofs it all the
way from Ohio to Hollywood

45:49.541 --> 45:50.542
to sit behind a desk.

45:53.169 --> 45:55.130
No, no, let me guess.

45:55.171 --> 45:56.047
You're not an actress.

45:56.089 --> 45:57.007
[laughs] No.

45:57.048 --> 45:59.217
Singer?

45:59.259 --> 46:00.468
Ah.

46:00.510 --> 46:03.221
You're a writer.

46:03.263 --> 46:04.222
How did you know that?

46:04.264 --> 46:05.098
Yeah, lucky guess.

46:05.140 --> 46:05.974
How did you know that?

46:06.016 --> 46:07.017
It's lucky guess, Lucy.

46:07.058 --> 46:08.309
Now tell me your story.

46:08.351 --> 46:09.144
Uh.

46:11.980 --> 46:15.108
Well, I'm not sure there's too
much I can say about myself.

46:15.150 --> 46:16.568
Well, hold on now,
that's not fair.

46:16.609 --> 46:17.736
I just told you my sad story.

46:17.777 --> 46:19.487
You got to tell me something.

46:19.529 --> 46:20.697
Start at the beginning.

46:20.739 --> 46:22.157
What's your favorite color?
Green.

46:22.198 --> 46:23.825
Green.
What's your favorite number?

46:23.867 --> 46:24.868
17 and 1/2.

46:24.909 --> 46:26.119
What's your picture?

46:26.161 --> 46:26.911
Wagons West.

46:26.953 --> 46:29.289
[laughs]

46:29.330 --> 46:32.751
[gentle music]

46:32.792 --> 46:36.796
We had a poinsettia on
our table every Christmas.

46:36.838 --> 46:38.923
My mother was a seamstress
for the mayor's wife,

46:38.965 --> 46:40.925
and she would gift us one
every season because she

46:40.967 --> 46:43.136
said it wasn't really
Christmas until

46:43.178 --> 46:45.180
you had your "poin-settia."

46:45.221 --> 46:47.015
Are you still close
with your folks?

46:47.057 --> 46:48.308
No.

46:48.350 --> 46:49.934
I've been an orphan
for a long time.

46:49.976 --> 46:51.644
They both passed.

46:51.686 --> 46:52.937
Sorry.

46:52.979 --> 46:55.482
My mother actually
left when I was little.

46:55.523 --> 47:01.321
So it's just been my dad
and my sister and me.

47:01.363 --> 47:02.489
I'm so sorry.

47:02.530 --> 47:03.365
Oh, it's OK.

47:03.406 --> 47:04.449
Thank you.

47:04.491 --> 47:06.826
But I learned a valuable lesson.

47:06.868 --> 47:09.120
If you put your faith in
people, eventually they're

47:09.162 --> 47:10.288
going to break your heart.

47:10.330 --> 47:12.374
So you have to protect yourself.

47:12.415 --> 47:14.793
You know?

47:14.834 --> 47:16.586
I've been giving
a lot of thought

47:16.628 --> 47:20.548
to your idea about Charlie
giving up his wings for love.

47:20.590 --> 47:21.841
And I think that he would.

47:24.886 --> 47:26.221
Would you?

47:26.262 --> 47:27.722
What?

47:27.764 --> 47:30.266
Would you really give
up what you wanted

47:30.308 --> 47:32.686
more than anything
else in the world

47:32.727 --> 47:34.229
for someone else's happiness?

47:37.148 --> 47:39.025
I don't know.

47:39.067 --> 47:46.491
But I hope that one day, I love
someone enough to find out.

47:46.533 --> 47:49.536
[gentle music]

47:51.329 --> 47:53.331
Detective pictures.

47:53.373 --> 47:54.624
What?

47:54.666 --> 47:56.167
What you write,
you write detective

47:56.209 --> 47:57.377
pictures like Dorothy Parker.

47:57.419 --> 47:58.753
[laughs] What
makes you say that?

47:58.795 --> 48:00.296
Well, I mean, you
don't strike me

48:00.338 --> 48:02.382
as the sword and
sandals type, and you're

48:02.424 --> 48:04.134
a little down on romance.

48:04.175 --> 48:05.468
I am-- what--

48:05.510 --> 48:07.929
I am not down on romance.

48:07.971 --> 48:11.975
I just want to write something
that's real and meaningful.

48:12.017 --> 48:13.852
Mm.

48:13.893 --> 48:17.022
Can't get any more meaningful
than two lonely hearts

48:17.063 --> 48:20.775
finding a little slice of
happiness in this crazy world.

48:20.817 --> 48:23.236
Give a little hope
to us poor saps.

48:23.278 --> 48:27.991
As my friend Jimmy likes
to say, "The best movies,

48:28.033 --> 48:29.951
they inspire us.

48:29.993 --> 48:34.080
They show us what we could be,
appeal to our better angels."

48:34.122 --> 48:36.499
[laughs] That's very good.

48:36.541 --> 48:37.250
Thank you.

48:37.292 --> 48:38.543
Yes.

48:38.585 --> 48:39.419
I don't write
detective pictures.

48:39.461 --> 48:40.712
Oh, oof.

48:40.754 --> 48:43.298
Usually, I am very good at this.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.507
Hold on.

48:44.549 --> 48:46.593
Let me see.

48:46.634 --> 48:48.595
[whistles]

48:49.346 --> 48:50.597
You're an early riser.

48:50.638 --> 48:51.389
Night owl.

48:51.431 --> 48:54.225
Mmm.

48:54.267 --> 48:55.685
Ah.

48:55.727 --> 48:56.603
You prefer dogs to cats

48:56.644 --> 48:57.979
Meow, meow.

48:58.021 --> 48:59.314
You like your coffee
with cream and sugar.

48:59.356 --> 49:00.106
Black.

49:00.148 --> 49:01.775
Mmm.

49:01.816 --> 49:03.651
You arrived at parties
late and you leave early.

49:03.693 --> 49:04.903
Now that I do.

49:04.944 --> 49:06.029
Me too.

49:06.071 --> 49:08.656
See?

49:08.698 --> 49:09.532
Give me your hand.

49:09.574 --> 49:10.533
Oh, gosh.

49:10.575 --> 49:11.409
I forgot.

49:11.451 --> 49:12.869
OK.

49:12.911 --> 49:14.412
High five.

49:14.454 --> 49:15.997
It's like good job.

49:16.039 --> 49:16.623
Come on, try.

49:16.664 --> 49:19.084
High five.

49:19.125 --> 49:21.336
Yeah, it's something
we do where I'm from.

49:21.378 --> 49:23.088
Santa Monica.

49:23.129 --> 49:24.130
By way of Ohio.

49:24.172 --> 49:25.131
Huh.

49:25.173 --> 49:28.093
[gentle music]

49:35.100 --> 49:37.352
[inquisitive music]

49:37.394 --> 49:39.521
Oh, Ms. Majors.

49:39.562 --> 49:40.605
Yes?

49:40.647 --> 49:41.564
Have you seen this Hardgrove?

49:41.606 --> 49:42.440
What?

49:42.482 --> 49:43.775
No.
Why?

49:43.817 --> 49:45.193
Well, she mentioned
she wanted to take

49:45.235 --> 49:47.195
some additional reference
photos of the hourglass.

49:47.237 --> 49:49.239
I thought I'd give her a
chance before it's gone.

49:49.280 --> 49:50.365
Gone?

49:50.407 --> 49:52.158
Where?

49:52.200 --> 49:53.618
It's going to be picked up by
the Smithsonian curator right

49:53.660 --> 49:54.619
after the holiday party.

49:54.661 --> 49:55.954
Tomorrow night?

49:55.995 --> 49:57.455
Yeah.

49:57.497 --> 49:59.290
So if you see her,
you'll tell her?

50:12.929 --> 50:15.640
Well, thank you for the hot
chocolate and the company.

50:15.682 --> 50:17.308
See?

50:17.350 --> 50:20.478
I'm not half bad if you don't
race off mid conversation.

50:20.520 --> 50:24.482
Well, good night.

50:24.524 --> 50:26.443
Well, no, I'm going to
walk you to your room.

50:26.484 --> 50:27.944
Oh, oh.

50:27.986 --> 50:29.362
No, that won't be necessary.

50:29.404 --> 50:30.488
I insist.

50:30.530 --> 50:33.491
[soft, light music]

50:33.533 --> 50:34.367
Uh.

50:43.043 --> 50:45.503
Oh, well, this is-- this is me.

50:45.545 --> 50:47.380
Huh.

50:47.422 --> 50:49.049
Are you sure?

50:49.090 --> 50:49.966
Sure.

50:50.008 --> 50:51.384
And you're sure you're sure?

50:51.426 --> 50:52.802
I'm sure I'm sure.

50:52.844 --> 50:56.723
That's funny because
359, that's mine.

50:56.765 --> 50:57.682
Oh, three.

50:57.724 --> 50:58.683
Oh, does that say three?

50:58.725 --> 51:02.020
Um, I'm one floor up.

51:02.062 --> 51:05.357
So I guess I'm walking
you to your door.

51:05.398 --> 51:10.111
[laughs] You're a little
screwy, aren't you?

51:10.153 --> 51:12.822
Honey, you have no idea.

51:12.864 --> 51:13.823
Good night, Lucy.

51:13.865 --> 51:16.868
Good night.

51:16.910 --> 51:18.036
I'm sorry.

51:24.584 --> 51:25.919
Excuse me.
Yes.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.420
I think Judy Garland is
stuck in your elevator.

51:27.462 --> 51:28.672
I can hear her shrieking.

51:28.713 --> 51:30.757
In E flat.

51:30.799 --> 51:33.677
[soft slinking music]

51:36.763 --> 51:38.223
[whistles softly]

51:38.264 --> 51:41.184
[gentle music]

51:48.942 --> 51:52.028
[chatter]

52:01.913 --> 52:04.749
I hear your Balaban's girl.

52:04.791 --> 52:05.667
[laughs softly]

52:07.585 --> 52:11.047
You're not really thinking of
recasting Rebecca, are you?

52:11.089 --> 52:12.298
Where did you get that idea?

52:19.389 --> 52:20.306
Lancaster.

52:24.811 --> 52:26.187
Rewrites?

52:26.229 --> 52:28.148
Well, a film is ever evolving.

52:28.189 --> 52:29.441
It's a good ending.

52:29.482 --> 52:32.610
I'm sorry they're
making you change it.

52:32.652 --> 52:35.321
No one's asked me to change it.

52:35.363 --> 52:36.239
They didn't?

52:36.281 --> 52:37.657
Not unless you're the messenger.

52:37.699 --> 52:38.867
No, I like it.

52:38.908 --> 52:39.701
Huh.

52:42.412 --> 52:45.415
I will admit Harold
had his reservations,

52:45.457 --> 52:48.501
but it's the only
ending I could see.

52:48.543 --> 52:49.919
Yes, it's honest.

52:49.961 --> 52:51.588
I mean, life rarely
gives us happy endings.

52:54.382 --> 52:55.383
That's true.

52:55.425 --> 52:58.261
[christmas music]

53:02.140 --> 53:05.310
My dad always says Christmas
is good for two things,

53:05.352 --> 53:09.647
and one of them is reconnecting
with people we love.

53:09.689 --> 53:10.857
What's the other?

53:10.899 --> 53:12.192
[laughs] Eggnog.

53:12.233 --> 53:14.819
[chuckles] You heard her.

53:14.861 --> 53:15.987
Two, please.

53:16.029 --> 53:18.782
[laughs] Thanks.

53:18.823 --> 53:20.825
Hey, cheers.

53:20.867 --> 53:22.952
We were together for 15 years.

53:22.994 --> 53:24.537
Mmm.

53:24.579 --> 53:26.414
Every Christmas, I'd always
ask for the same thing--

53:26.456 --> 53:27.207
a new tie.

53:27.248 --> 53:28.416
[laughs]

53:28.458 --> 53:30.335
She always insisted
on tying it for me

53:30.377 --> 53:32.003
to make sure it was straight.

53:32.045 --> 53:34.255
It's the only time I ever
let her fuss over me.

53:37.467 --> 53:42.013
And then one day, she told me
that she was tired of sharing

53:42.055 --> 53:43.056
me with my job.

53:45.725 --> 53:46.726
I can't blame her.

53:46.768 --> 53:48.353
It's a lonely life.

53:48.395 --> 53:51.606
Have you thought about
telling her that you miss her?

53:51.648 --> 53:53.900
Great gal like that doesn't
wait around for an old fool

53:53.942 --> 53:56.361
like me to come to his senses.

53:56.403 --> 53:59.406
Thanks, but I would rather
spare myself the heartache.

54:04.327 --> 54:06.454
It doesn't seem like you've
been spared much at all.

54:11.543 --> 54:14.838
[gentle piano music]

54:44.409 --> 54:46.870
[chatter]

54:59.215 --> 55:02.302
[light music]

55:06.389 --> 55:08.266
What are you going to
do for Christmas, Lucy?

55:08.308 --> 55:13.021
I know, let's time travel back
to 1947 and get stuck there.

55:13.063 --> 55:16.107
[sighs] Why couldn't the
hourglass be a DeLorean?

55:16.149 --> 55:19.486
[upbeat piano music]

55:29.621 --> 55:30.663
Hi.

55:30.705 --> 55:31.373
Don't stop on my account.

55:31.414 --> 55:32.624
I was enjoying the show.

55:32.665 --> 55:35.585
Actually, you're in
time for the duet.

55:35.627 --> 55:37.712
Oh.

55:37.754 --> 55:39.214
Oh, brother.

55:39.255 --> 55:40.131
I mean, you said for
yourself, you go caroling

55:40.173 --> 55:41.132
every Christmas Eve, right?

55:41.174 --> 55:42.342
That's true.

55:42.384 --> 55:46.012
Well, you know "Jingle Bells"?

55:46.054 --> 55:49.391
Do I know "Jingle Bells"?

55:49.432 --> 55:50.892
Say, do I know "Jingle "Bells"?

55:50.934 --> 55:51.685
[laughs]

55:53.687 --> 55:57.190
["jingle bells" playing]

56:00.652 --> 56:01.695
Oh, excuse me.

56:04.531 --> 56:06.408
(SINGING) Dashing
through the snow--

56:06.449 --> 56:07.575
Oh.

56:07.617 --> 56:11.204
(SINGING) --on a one
horse open sleigh.

56:11.246 --> 56:16.334
O'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way.

56:16.376 --> 56:18.003
(SINGING) Bells on bobtail ring.

56:18.044 --> 56:19.045
There it is.

56:19.087 --> 56:20.505
(SINGING) Making spirits bright.

56:20.547 --> 56:21.715
Nice.

56:21.756 --> 56:23.717
(SINGING) What fun it
is to laugh and sing

56:23.758 --> 56:26.261
a sleighing song tonight.

56:26.302 --> 56:30.140
(BOTH SINGING) Oh, jingle
bells, jingle bells,

56:30.181 --> 56:32.517
jingle all the way.

56:32.559 --> 56:36.312
Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh.

56:36.354 --> 56:38.523
Jingle bells, jingle bells.

56:38.565 --> 56:39.858
(SINGING) Jingle all the way.

56:39.899 --> 56:41.526
Beautiful.

56:41.568 --> 56:44.195
(BOTH SINGING) Oh, what fun
it is to ride in a one horse

56:44.237 --> 56:48.950
open sleigh.

56:48.992 --> 56:49.784
[laughs]

56:49.826 --> 56:50.618
There we go.

56:50.660 --> 56:51.453
That's--

56:54.539 --> 56:58.209
They never should have cut you
for Meet Me in Poughkeepsie.

56:58.251 --> 57:01.129
Better save the encore.

57:01.171 --> 57:02.714
You hear the news?

57:02.756 --> 57:03.715
What news?

57:03.757 --> 57:05.050
Hayward's out.

57:05.091 --> 57:06.092
She's fired?

57:06.134 --> 57:07.093
She quit.

57:07.135 --> 57:09.262
[dramatic music]

57:12.724 --> 57:14.601
What do you mean she's gone?

57:14.642 --> 57:17.771
Peggy said that she grabbed
all of her stuff and took off.

57:17.812 --> 57:20.315
Had the sound guys
toting her luggage.

57:20.357 --> 57:22.108
Maybe it's time to replace her.
No.

57:22.150 --> 57:23.443
You can't.

57:23.485 --> 57:24.569
What about everything
you shot already?

57:24.611 --> 57:27.655
[sighs] We'll cut our losses.

57:27.697 --> 57:29.366
There's nothing we can do.

57:29.407 --> 57:32.077
The studio will jump at the
chance to cast a bigger name.

57:32.118 --> 57:34.621
It was the fight of my
life to get them to agree

57:34.662 --> 57:36.039
to Ava in the first place.

57:36.081 --> 57:37.457
Just give me today.

57:37.499 --> 57:39.042
I'll find her.

57:39.084 --> 57:40.960
Please, it's Christmas Eve.

57:41.002 --> 57:42.295
One day.

57:42.337 --> 57:44.339
Hey, wait, where are you going?

57:44.381 --> 57:45.465
Hold on.

57:45.507 --> 57:47.133
Lucy, what are you going to do?

57:47.175 --> 57:48.635
I'm going to go search every
hotel, airport, and bus station

57:48.677 --> 57:50.345
until I find her.
She can't have gotten far.

57:50.387 --> 57:52.305
Why are you sticking
your neck out?

57:52.347 --> 57:54.057
You heard what West said.

57:54.099 --> 57:55.475
Your boss never wanted her.

57:55.517 --> 57:57.143
He'll probably be over the moon.

57:57.185 --> 57:59.813
Any meddling behind his back is
going to land you in hot water.

57:59.854 --> 58:00.563
[laughs]

58:00.605 --> 58:02.357
Now, I like Ava.

58:02.399 --> 58:03.775
But you don't owe her anything.

58:03.817 --> 58:05.026
Yes, I do.

58:05.068 --> 58:06.945
This whole thing happened
because I came in.

58:06.986 --> 58:08.405
I'm going to make it right now.
Is there a phone around here?

58:08.446 --> 58:11.074
Lucy, you may be OK with
crossing Mr. Balaban,

58:11.116 --> 58:14.994
but I got a three-picture
deal on the line.

58:15.036 --> 58:15.829
I understand.

58:15.870 --> 58:16.955
I do, actually.

58:16.996 --> 58:18.957
I think there's a
phone at the inn.

58:18.998 --> 58:21.876
[soft music]

58:22.711 --> 58:25.755
[light festive music]

58:28.133 --> 58:29.050
[horn honks]

58:31.052 --> 58:31.886
Hop in, kid.

58:34.973 --> 58:36.766
I got a tip from the
parking attendant.

58:36.808 --> 58:39.853
I heard that she was headed
for the train station.

58:39.894 --> 58:40.603
Come on.

58:40.645 --> 58:44.065
[upbeat jazzy music]

58:49.320 --> 58:50.864
Sorry.

58:50.905 --> 58:52.032
Excuse me.

58:52.073 --> 58:53.450
What time is it?

58:53.491 --> 58:55.118
Oh, it's going to be a
miracle if we find her.

58:55.160 --> 58:57.829
Well, lucky for you,
it's Christmas time,

58:57.871 --> 58:59.789
and there's a miracle
around every corner.

58:59.831 --> 59:01.082
That's a line from the movie.

59:01.124 --> 59:02.042
It's a good line.

59:02.083 --> 59:03.043
Ah, see?

59:03.084 --> 59:04.669
There she is.

59:04.711 --> 59:07.213
[clears throat] Ava.

59:07.255 --> 59:09.382
Save your breath, Huston.

59:09.424 --> 59:10.300
I've made up my mind.

59:10.342 --> 59:11.217
Come on.

59:11.259 --> 59:12.135
Come back to set.

59:12.177 --> 59:13.720
We need you.

59:13.762 --> 59:15.722
You and I both know I
wasn't the studio's choice,

59:15.764 --> 59:17.223
first, second, or third.

59:17.265 --> 59:19.809
Mr. Balaban's had my
replacement lined up for weeks,

59:19.851 --> 59:21.770
with the enthusiastic
endorsement of Mr.

59:21.811 --> 59:23.229
Claude Lancaster no doubt.

59:23.271 --> 59:24.731
Who cares what they think?

59:24.773 --> 59:26.399
You were born to play this role.

59:26.441 --> 59:27.734
She's right.

59:27.776 --> 59:28.777
Worst thing you can
do in this business

59:28.818 --> 59:30.195
is overstay your welcome.

59:30.236 --> 59:32.572
The audience gave up
on me a long time ago.

59:32.614 --> 59:33.782
Maybe it's time I took the hint.

59:33.823 --> 59:35.283
What are you going to do?

59:35.325 --> 59:36.951
I haven't decided yet.

59:36.993 --> 59:40.080
Maybe I'll buy a farm with
some chickens and an old goat.

59:40.121 --> 59:41.414
A goat?

59:41.456 --> 59:42.916
Yes, get a slice of
that simple life.

59:42.957 --> 59:44.292
Listen.

59:44.334 --> 59:45.752
I know things seem
bad right now.

59:45.794 --> 59:49.923
But you are destined
for great things,

59:49.964 --> 59:52.634
and it all starts
with this part.

59:52.676 --> 59:54.302
Your friend talks
like a fortune cookie.

59:54.344 --> 59:56.304
I know, that's a
part of her charm.

59:56.346 --> 59:58.848
Now arriving, 6:20 to New York.

59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.101
Well, I appreciate the pep
talk, but that's my train.

01:00:01.142 --> 01:00:01.768
You can't go.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:02.644
Hey, you know what?

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:03.687
Lucy, let her go.

01:00:03.728 --> 01:00:04.813
She can't hack it anyway.

01:00:04.854 --> 01:00:06.481
What?

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:08.775
Have you heard back
from Hepburn yet?

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:11.611
Uh, well, actually, we're
going to go with Veronica Lake.

01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:13.196
I think Claude's a big fan.

01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:14.322
Oh, I bet he is.

01:00:14.364 --> 01:00:15.949
Ah, Ava, I'm so sorry.

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.784
This is business movie talk.
It doesn't it concern you.

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:19.452
Sayanora, arrivederci, all that.

01:00:19.494 --> 01:00:20.537
Send us a postcard
when you get there.

01:00:20.578 --> 01:00:22.330
Mm.

01:00:22.372 --> 01:00:24.040
He says he's going to give her
a [clears throat] top billing.

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:25.333
Oh, is that so?

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:26.459
And the bigger dressing room.

01:00:26.501 --> 01:00:27.627
You don't say.

01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:29.462
You know, Claude is a swell guy.

01:00:29.504 --> 01:00:31.214
Swell, my foot.

01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:33.466
Claude Lancaster wouldn't
know good intentions if it

01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:35.135
knocked him upside the head.

01:00:35.176 --> 01:00:37.804
And if he thinks for one
second he's going to replace me

01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:39.472
with one of those
silly actresses

01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:44.019
from his Christmas list, well,
he's got another thing coming.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.148
And for the record, I saw
right through this little song

01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:49.733
and dance.

01:00:49.774 --> 01:00:51.359
But does that mean you're
coming back with us anyway?

01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:58.783
I just remembered.

01:00:58.825 --> 01:01:01.619
I'm allergic to goats.

01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:04.122
Oh, boys?

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:08.543
[laughs] Well, we
just squeaked by.

01:01:08.585 --> 01:01:12.255
[laughs] Hey.

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:14.174
[train blares]

01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:20.388
Thanks, fellas.

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.224
[light jazzy music]

01:01:31.524 --> 01:01:35.028
Well, now you are an odd duck,
but I think I got your number.

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.654
Oh?

01:01:36.696 --> 01:01:38.281
You say that you're
a solo act, but you

01:01:38.323 --> 01:01:40.867
seem to care an awful lot about
the happiness of other people.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.702
Well, guess you've got
me all figured out.

01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:44.037
Almost all figured out.

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:45.288
There is one thing
I'd like to know.

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.873
What's that?

01:01:46.915 --> 01:01:48.708
Would you like to be my
date to the Christmas party?

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.001
Oh, brother.

01:01:50.043 --> 01:01:51.294
Is it too late to
pick the chickens?

01:01:51.336 --> 01:01:53.296
(BOTH) Yes.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:56.216
[upbeat jazzy music]

01:01:57.258 --> 01:02:00.136
[chatter]

01:02:20.865 --> 01:02:23.034
You look beautiful.

01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:23.743
Thank you.

01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:25.370
Ava lent her dress.

01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:28.331
You're welcome.

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:31.251
[light jazzy music]

01:02:40.635 --> 01:02:41.761
Thank you.

01:02:41.803 --> 01:02:42.512
You're welcome.

01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:43.430
Cheers.

01:02:51.354 --> 01:02:54.482
Now, the family
started this tradition

01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:59.612
of handing out presents on
Christmas Eve back in 1895.

01:02:59.654 --> 01:03:00.739
Can you believe that?

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.451
It's been nearly 52 years.

01:03:04.492 --> 01:03:05.618
Is that--

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:09.205
Mm-hmm, that's Bill's wife.

01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:10.290
[sighs]

01:03:10.331 --> 01:03:13.585
[light cheerful music]

01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:20.133
Merry Christmas.

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:21.343
Merry Christmas.

01:03:21.384 --> 01:03:22.135
Thank you.

01:03:22.177 --> 01:03:23.178
You're welcome.

01:03:23.219 --> 01:03:23.970
Hi.

01:03:24.012 --> 01:03:25.388
Hi.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:29.559
Well, I see you managed to
corral our wayward star.

01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:31.978
Yes, with a little help.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.188
I wanted to thank you.

01:03:33.229 --> 01:03:34.856
Oh.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.359
I took your advice and called
my wife and apologized,

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.651
told her I missed her.

01:03:38.693 --> 01:03:39.861
What did she say?

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.988
She asked me what
took me so long.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:45.116
[laughs] You know, I guess my
happy ending was always there.

01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:47.327
I just needed to open
my eyes and see it.

01:03:47.369 --> 01:03:50.830
And maybe these characters
deserve a happy ending, too.

01:03:50.872 --> 01:03:52.749
He ain't lying, sheriff.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:55.835
The horse belongs
to Billy the Kid.

01:03:55.877 --> 01:04:00.090
[imitates gunfire]
Oh, you got me.

01:04:00.131 --> 01:04:03.677
Well, if I don't see you before
tomorrow, Merry Christmas.

01:04:03.718 --> 01:04:04.969
Merry Christmas.

01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:08.056
[soft, light music]

01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:19.275
[slow festive music]

01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:30.203
Oh.

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:30.870
Hello.

01:04:30.912 --> 01:04:33.039
I know your secret.

01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:34.249
Oh?

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:38.169
Mm, you talked Ava
back into the picture.

01:04:38.211 --> 01:04:40.714
Yes, well, you have
nothing to worry about.

01:04:40.755 --> 01:04:41.965
She's going to be great.

01:04:42.007 --> 01:04:44.384
Oh, we had a plan.

01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:45.385
You had a plan.

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:47.053
There was no we.

01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:51.391
Ah, see, now that's where
you're wrong, Ms. Hardgrove.

01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:52.225
May I cut in?

01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:52.851
No.

01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:53.727
Yes.

01:04:53.768 --> 01:04:54.561
Hi.

01:04:54.602 --> 01:04:56.187
Hi.

01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:57.772
I should have known
that your dance

01:04:57.814 --> 01:04:59.190
card would have
filled up the minute

01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:00.567
you stepped on the dance floor.

01:05:00.608 --> 01:05:03.028
This is where I admit
I have two left feet.

01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:06.948
Ah, well, then just
follow my lead.

01:05:10.785 --> 01:05:13.705
[soft music]

01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:45.111
You know, the thought
has just occurred to me

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:48.239
that it is Christmas
Eve, and I didn't

01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.992
get you a Christmas gift.

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:52.118
I don't need a gift.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.120
Yeah, but I want
you to have one,

01:05:54.162 --> 01:05:57.123
and I think I know
just the thing.

01:05:57.165 --> 01:05:59.459
[laughs] I can't
take your watch.

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:03.838
Yes, you can because I think
that you use it more than I do.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.925
And next time
you're running late,

01:06:06.966 --> 01:06:10.720
well, you can think of me.

01:06:10.762 --> 01:06:11.513
I will.

01:06:11.554 --> 01:06:14.224
Thank you.

01:06:14.265 --> 01:06:16.768
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:20.146
If you don't have to get back
to Los Angeles right away,

01:06:20.188 --> 01:06:23.692
there's a little shindig
down in the village.

01:06:23.733 --> 01:06:24.734
Um.

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:25.527
What?

01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:31.324
Too much too soon?

01:06:31.366 --> 01:06:41.251
I just-- I feel like I have
always meant to know you.

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:42.752
And now that I've
met you, I can't

01:06:42.794 --> 01:06:44.295
see a future without you in it.

01:06:46.923 --> 01:06:47.716
Oh, gosh.

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:53.430
I'm sorry.

01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:54.097
What am I doing?

01:06:54.139 --> 01:06:55.015
This isn't real.

01:06:55.056 --> 01:06:56.516
None of this is real.

01:06:56.558 --> 01:06:57.308
Lucy.

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:59.019
No.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.186
I'm so sorry.

01:07:04.065 --> 01:07:05.734
I wasn't expecting you.

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:12.198
[somber music]

01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:22.834
Oh, Ms. Hardgrove, I've
been looking for you.

01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:24.002
Oh.

01:07:24.044 --> 01:07:25.295
Is everything all right?
Yes.

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:26.629
Thank you.

01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:28.298
Well, we were able
to fix the hourglass.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.924
What?
The hourglass.

01:07:29.966 --> 01:07:30.884
I took care of it.

01:07:30.925 --> 01:07:32.052
Good as new
Thank you.

01:07:32.093 --> 01:07:33.762
Where is it?

01:07:33.803 --> 01:07:36.014
It's in the prop master's
truck, parked right out front.

01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:37.807
All right.

01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:38.600
Merry Christmas.

01:07:38.641 --> 01:07:39.684
Merry Christmas.

01:07:44.439 --> 01:07:47.442
[gentle music]

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:52.655
Here, sweetheart.

01:07:52.697 --> 01:07:53.490
Peppermint.

01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:54.866
Michael.

01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:57.786
Michael, I told you to
stay where I could see you.

01:07:57.827 --> 01:07:59.412
Your grandfather
will be back as soon

01:07:59.454 --> 01:08:00.955
as he's talked to Mr. West.

01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:04.334
Michael Balaban?

01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:05.460
[exhales]

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.046
Well, that means
your grandfather is--

01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:08.922
Harold.

01:08:08.963 --> 01:08:09.839
He just got in.

01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:10.715
Come along now.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.055
[dramatic music]

01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:22.394
Where's West?

01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:23.603
I'm not sure, sir.

01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.647
I think his wife just arrived.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:28.483
Do you know how much money
I've sunk into this picture?

01:08:28.525 --> 01:08:30.652
Too much for him to
take a second honeymoon.

01:08:30.694 --> 01:08:31.903
Absolutely.

01:08:31.945 --> 01:08:34.030
I just wanted to talk to
you about Ms. Hardgrove.

01:08:34.072 --> 01:08:34.948
Who?

01:08:34.989 --> 01:08:36.449
Ms. Hardgrove?

01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:38.743
The studio liaison you sent.

01:08:38.785 --> 01:08:41.663
Son, if I sent
someone in my place,

01:08:41.705 --> 01:08:43.623
why would I be standing here?

01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:46.710
But she's been on set for days.

01:08:46.751 --> 01:08:49.337
Probably works for
one of those tabloids.

01:08:49.379 --> 01:08:51.339
You, come here.

01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:54.426
I want you to find this
Hardgrove lady, now.

01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:57.429
[foreboding music]

01:08:59.848 --> 01:09:01.266
[light music]

01:09:01.307 --> 01:09:03.351
Oh, I just can't thank
you enough for taking

01:09:03.393 --> 01:09:04.686
me through the house again.

01:09:04.728 --> 01:09:05.562
Twice.

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:07.689
It's just so much to see.

01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:10.233
And we only have a few
dozen more items to get to.

01:09:10.275 --> 01:09:11.943
We're going to have to
get to that tomorrow

01:09:11.985 --> 01:09:13.028
because I have got--

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.195
But I won't be here tomorrow.

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.030
I'll get Paige.

01:09:15.071 --> 01:09:15.864
I'll get--

01:09:15.905 --> 01:09:16.865
[shouts]

01:09:16.906 --> 01:09:19.075
What happened?

01:09:19.117 --> 01:09:20.118
It's my trick knee.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.786
It always acts up in the cold.

01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:23.204
[groans]

01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:26.041
[groaning]

01:09:28.752 --> 01:09:31.921
[heavy music]

01:09:31.963 --> 01:09:33.089
Lucy.

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:34.215
Can we talk?

01:09:34.257 --> 01:09:35.175
I have to go.

01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:35.967
Go where?

01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:37.093
Why?

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.053
I can't explain it right now.

01:09:38.094 --> 01:09:39.304
Lucy.

01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:40.889
Jack, I'm not who
you think I am.

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:42.390
What does that mean?

01:09:42.432 --> 01:09:43.725
Who are you?

01:09:43.767 --> 01:09:46.269
There she is.

01:09:46.311 --> 01:09:47.145
Oh, no.

01:09:47.187 --> 01:09:50.023
[tense music]

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:53.943
Ms. Majors, stop.

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:00.116
Lucy.

01:10:02.952 --> 01:10:04.746
Why are you running?

01:10:04.788 --> 01:10:07.624
[tense music]

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:11.086
What is going on?

01:10:11.127 --> 01:10:12.420
You can trust me.

01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:14.130
Talk to me.

01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:16.508
OK.

01:10:16.549 --> 01:10:18.343
I'm not from the studio.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:20.637
Where are you from?

01:10:20.679 --> 01:10:21.846
I'm from the future.

01:10:21.888 --> 01:10:22.681
Huh?

01:10:25.809 --> 01:10:27.018
What's the gag?

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.728
I'm from 80 years
in the future, Jack.

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:30.563
I turned an hourglass,
the one that I broke,

01:10:30.605 --> 01:10:34.901
and it brought me here,
and now I'm stuck.

01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:35.985
You're serious.

01:10:36.027 --> 01:10:37.445
If they find me,
they'll take me away,

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:38.863
and I'll never be
able to get home.

01:10:38.905 --> 01:10:40.323
[knocking]

01:10:40.365 --> 01:10:43.159
Let me in, Jack.

01:10:43.201 --> 01:10:44.327
Give me a key for this door.

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:45.495
[knocking]

01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:48.331
I know it sounds crazy.

01:10:48.373 --> 01:10:49.207
I do.

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:53.294
Let me in!

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.046
[knocking]

01:10:55.088 --> 01:10:57.549
You got five seconds to
open this door, Huston,

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.134
or you could kiss
your career goodbye.

01:10:59.175 --> 01:11:01.177
[tense music]

01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:02.595
I just need to get
to the hourglass

01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:03.763
on the prop master's truck.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:07.767
[knocking]

01:11:11.021 --> 01:11:14.149
There's a back door,
up those stairs.

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.108
Go.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.109
I'll buy you some time.

01:11:16.151 --> 01:11:19.112
Thank you.

01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:20.071
Jack.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:23.033
[soft music]

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:28.246
Go.
Thank you.

01:11:28.288 --> 01:11:29.039
Thank you.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:32.751
Lucy.

01:11:35.712 --> 01:11:38.757
I'm glad that you
came into my life,

01:11:38.798 --> 01:11:40.550
even if it was only
for a little while.

01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:48.516
Oh, Jack, there's something you
need to know about your life.

01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:49.851
On Christmas Eve 1948--

01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:50.769
[lock clicks]

01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.275
Where's the girl?

01:11:57.317 --> 01:11:59.069
Hiya, fellas.

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:01.154
Where's the girl?

01:12:01.196 --> 01:12:02.530
Don't be smart with me, Huston.

01:12:02.572 --> 01:12:04.532
I saw her come in the room.

01:12:04.574 --> 01:12:07.118
Now where did she go?

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.953
She went home, Balaban.

01:12:08.995 --> 01:12:09.788
Home.

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:16.920
[tense music]

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.756
Where do you think you're going?

01:12:19.798 --> 01:12:21.758
Oh, hi, I was looking for you.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.926
Save it.

01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:25.387
I know you're not
from the studio.

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:26.596
Fine, you got me.

01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:27.389

like a word first.

Oh, thank goodness.

Your friend was very
determined that you

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:09.866
have one last chance
to see the hourglass

01:14:09.908 --> 01:14:10.950

I tried to warn him.

I guess some things are
just always meant to be.

that you died.

that we planted just
