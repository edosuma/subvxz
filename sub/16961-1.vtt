WEBVTT

02:02.748 --> 02:03.915
Hm.

02:07.252 --> 02:11.088
- Arsenio Hall!
- Woo! Woo! Woo!

02:16.345 --> 02:19.430
Team Two take the prison.
We get the villa.

02:43.622 --> 02:47.124
Little Sister, this is Big Brother,
we are in the ballpark.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.766
Big Brother,
Little Sister. We're at the prison.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.622
Little Sister, Big Brother.
Are you in position?

04:07.831 --> 04:12.209
Big Brother, Little Sister,
affirmative. Attack in 30.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.128
Starting now.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.556
Hm!

04:33.357 --> 04:34.565
Ooh! Ooh!

04:40.238 --> 04:42.239
Ah, ah. Ooh.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.090
Six...

04:59.341 --> 05:04.762
...five, four, three, two...

05:07.933 --> 05:08.933
It's an ambush!

05:13.563 --> 05:15.606
Alka-Seltzer!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.109
Whoa!

05:18.777 --> 05:19.777
Ahh!

05:21.363 --> 05:24.198
Big Brother!
Harbinger, where are you?

05:27.953 --> 05:29.829
Ahh!

05:33.041 --> 05:34.625
Ahh! Ah! Ah!

05:38.338 --> 05:39.797
Ah! Oh!

05:43.135 --> 05:46.470
Surrender, Yankee
infidels! You have no chance.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.640
Off to prison, American Satans.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.792
Americans were shocked
by the announcement of the failure

06:17.002 --> 06:20.629
of yet another mission to
rescue hostages from the Middle East.

06:20.839 --> 06:24.842
Informed sources reveal that the
rescue team itself has been captured

06:25.093 --> 06:27.344
and added to those
already being held.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.347
Reports also indicate that
an attempt on the life

06:30.599 --> 06:34.351
of a terrorist dictator
was thwarted at the same time.

06:34.603 --> 06:39.273
With the election 10 days away, it
may be a setback for the White House.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.818
Presidential challenger
Senator Gray Edwards

06:43.028 --> 06:45.321
commented on the failed mission.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.698
This is no time for partisan politics.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.910
Bringing our people home
should be our priority.

06:51.286 --> 06:55.623
Despite this crisis, the president
put on his best political face

06:55.832 --> 06:57.875
continuing on his campaign schedule.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.878
Benson's 20-point lead
in the poll six months ago

07:01.129 --> 07:04.340
has plummeted since
the hostage crisis began.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.842
The CNN/Victoria's Secret
catalog poll

07:07.052 --> 07:10.179
has the president
and Edwards running neck and neck.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.974
Today, Benson made a brief stop
in Fergus Falls, Virginia

07:14.184 --> 07:17.144
- for a groundbreaking of a library.
- You took my baby!

07:17.354 --> 07:19.647
The five living
former chief executives

07:19.815 --> 07:23.567
Presidents Bush, Reagan,
Carter, Ford and Nixon

07:23.735 --> 07:26.362
were on hand for
the groundbreaking ceremony.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.990
Correspondent Jeri Kelter
reports on this historic moment.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.744
The library is to be built near
the Fergus Falls Civic Center.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.331
- President Benson made no statements.
- Oh! My knee!

07:37.499 --> 07:41.919
Publicly, he seemed unaware of
the political blow he had been dealt.

07:42.087 --> 07:47.049
Privately, aides marveled at his spirit
as he performed his morning routine

07:47.259 --> 07:49.093
by milking the White House goats

07:49.261 --> 07:52.429
and eating two helpings
of grapefruit and creamed corn.

07:53.181 --> 07:57.935
Tonight, the president and his top
advisers will burn the midnight oil.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.020
Sabotage.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.606
My God, man, what does it mean?

08:02.774 --> 08:05.943
We must tighten security, sir.
Find out who's behind it.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.572
No, no, no. The word "sabotage."
What does it mean?

08:09.781 --> 08:11.949
Someone's subverting our mission, sir.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.410
One of our own may be
aiding the enemy.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.328
Come in!

08:18.290 --> 08:19.582
Mr. President.

08:19.791 --> 08:23.711
Oh, Jesus! Don't you ever sneak up
on me like that again.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.962
What is it, Bob?

08:25.130 --> 08:28.132
If Edwards hears of this,
he'll use it against you.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.135
- He'll try to prove you're incompetent.
- I can prove that too.

08:32.304 --> 08:35.306
Mr. President, the CIA can't
afford another failure.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.058
We'll send Colonel Walters
to get our people.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.602
To ensure success,
we need Topper Harley.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.938
We've located him in the Far East.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.149
Topper Harley.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.737
We've served together before, sir.
There's no one better.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.824
- Cookie?
- Not me, sir.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.285
- Young lady?
- No, thank you.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.330
No, no, I was just
offering him a young lady.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.292
Oh, yeah, Topper Harley.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.253
Good. I love the boy.
Kid's got guts.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.757
There isn't a fighting man
on this planet that can...

09:10.967 --> 09:13.177
Gotcha!
Listening at the door, huh?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.222
Well, Walters, looks like
we've got our saboteur.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.723
That's your wife, sir.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.269
Huh! Yeah, so it is.

09:22.896 --> 09:27.483
Lavinia. You're looking
as lovely as the day we met.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.236
Find out what she knows.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.155
As for you, get me Topper Harley.

10:28.878 --> 10:29.920
Hm?

11:16.301 --> 11:19.219
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles!

11:19.429 --> 11:23.223
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles...

11:31.191 --> 11:33.025
You fight!

11:53.546 --> 11:55.839
Aisle 5, mezzanine, to your left.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.634
Get your program right here. Program!

11:58.843 --> 12:00.344
One pig snout sandwich.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.049
Both fighters are showing
signs of fatigue.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.885
They aren't moving
around the ring as much.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.763
Hey, this is where
your conditioning pays off.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.090
Coochie-coochie-coo. Coochie-goo.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.442
You win!

13:43.990 --> 13:47.993
Topper, Topper, Topper, Topper...

13:48.203 --> 13:49.703
Topper Harley!

13:56.586 --> 13:57.628
Mmm.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.447
Topper.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.492
I don't believe it.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.996
- Topper.
- Colonel.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.750
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.752
You want to tell me about it?

14:40.171 --> 14:42.172
Well, they let me live here.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.675
I help out fixing things.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.594
It's peaceful. Quiet.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.016
No one is allowed to talk.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.436
And that dim sum fighting
in the warehouse yesterday?

14:56.646 --> 14:58.605
I do that for the extra money.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.067
And to satisfy my male cravings
to kill and win.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.320
Colonel, who are they?

15:06.489 --> 15:07.948
She's CIA.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.117
- The other man's an extra.
- Ah.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.244
What does she do?

15:12.495 --> 15:14.830
Heads up Middle East
covert operations.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.748
Reports directly to Benson.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.210
Colonel, these men have taken
a supreme vow of celibacy.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.088
Like their fathers and grandfathers.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.507
They haven't seen a woman in decades.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.217
Miss Huddleston!

15:28.469 --> 15:29.845
Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:30.346 --> 15:32.556
This is Michelle Huddleston.

15:32.807 --> 15:33.890
Topper Harley.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.142
Pleasure.

15:35.268 --> 15:38.228
- You're not easy to find.
- Why are you keeping track?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.938
It's like the colonel says:

15:40.189 --> 15:42.399
Good men are hard to find.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.736
I don't know what you know
about the last war,

15:45.945 --> 15:48.405
but some of our men
were missing in action.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.742
On two occasions we sent in
squads to rescue those men.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.076
Both squads failed.

15:53.244 --> 15:57.122
We must get the men who went to
get the men who went to get the men.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.917
- I'm here to make sure we succeed.
- What's this got to do with me?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.377
I'm going this time.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.256
- We want you to go with him.
- Why me, ma'am?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.216
Because you're the best
of what's left.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.928
My war is over.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.103
Mmm... Ah!

16:22.607 --> 16:24.316
It's a few extra dollars now.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.319
But you'll make that back
on your heating bill.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.947
We're gonna caulk the ashram
if you want to stop by.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.449
Thanks, Bob.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.956
This mission's important.
We've got to take care of our people.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.833
Come with me.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.673
When are you gonna
put Ramada behind you?

16:48.466 --> 16:51.468
- What are you saying?
- You say your war is over.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.681
Maybe the one out there is,
but not the one inside you.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.975
You running from the pain
won't solve anything.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.312
Because wherever you go,
you take the pain with you.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.357
You've come an awful
long way to lecture me.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.818
You were hurt
when that woman left.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.862
You're using that to hide
from who you really are.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.531
- That was a long time ago.
- Thank you. Next!

17:13.741 --> 17:15.157
I don't want it.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.703
Nice butt.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.707
Topper, let me tell you
a little story.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.376
It seems there were three bears.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.921
One day when their porridge was
too hot, they took a walk.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.091
A little blond girl
skipped through the woods

17:31.342 --> 17:34.386
and she ate their porridge
and sat in their chairs

17:34.595 --> 17:36.179
and slept in their beds.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.850
And when those bears returned
and discovered that mess...

17:40.101 --> 17:43.103
- Do you know what happened then?
- No.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.690
That little blond girl got scared.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.025
Ran away.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.029
So, what you're saying is,
that little blond girl is me.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.616
So I should color my hair...

17:56.868 --> 17:59.870
Topper, they didn't make you this
fighting machine.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.540
They just cooked up the porridge
and went for a walk.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.877
You won't stop running
until you face your three bears.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.546
Ramada.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.091
Colonel.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.051
I'm sorry.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.095
It has to end for me sometime.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.389
If you should change your mind

18:19.599 --> 18:21.141
here's my 900 number.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.436
It's $5.00 a minute.
I'll waive the charges.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.236
...your three bears.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.948
Ramada. Ramada. Ramada.

19:00.264 --> 19:05.101
If our lips should meet
Inamorata

19:05.937 --> 19:07.604
Don Corleone.

19:07.730 --> 19:12.484
Kiss me, kiss me sweet
Inamorata

19:14.612 --> 19:19.407
Hold me close
And say goodnight

19:21.661 --> 19:26.790
With a love
As warm as wine

19:28.793 --> 19:34.381
I'm at heaven's door
Inamorata

19:36.092 --> 19:41.179
Want you more and more
Inamorata

19:43.015 --> 19:45.559
You're a symphony

19:45.977 --> 19:51.147
A very beautiful sonata
My inamorata

19:51.816 --> 19:57.320
Say that you're my sweetheart
My love

20:27.810 --> 20:30.437
You're a symphony

20:30.563 --> 20:35.984
A very beautiful sonata
My inamorata

20:36.694 --> 20:42.490
Say that you're my sweetheart
My love

20:45.953 --> 20:48.747
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.751
I love you so much.

20:53.044 --> 20:56.922
But it's such a crazy world.
I don't want anything to happen to us.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.423
Don't worry.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.718
In a few days,
we'll be on the train to Hawaii.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.555
We'll find a minister to marry us,
and we'll never be apart.

21:05.723 --> 21:08.391
But if something should keep us apart?

21:08.601 --> 21:12.062
If one of us can't make it
to Blenheim Train Station?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.813
Like, for instance,

21:14.065 --> 21:16.900
if something came up unexpectedly.

21:17.109 --> 21:21.112
Not that I think it would.
Or it already has.

21:21.405 --> 21:25.075
Wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that...

21:31.666 --> 21:33.416
Kiss me.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.920
Kiss me like you've
never kissed me before.

21:54.438 --> 21:58.608
You will denounce the criminal acts
against our people by your president.

21:58.776 --> 22:02.153
Sign here.
Initial here, here, and here.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.790
Phil!

22:29.849 --> 22:31.641
Sign the document.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.547
I see you're no stranger to pain.

23:02.757 --> 23:03.840
I've been married.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.844
- Twice.
- Oy!

23:17.521 --> 23:21.858
Like the previous six, this victim
was found folded neatly in half

23:22.276 --> 23:25.361
inside the glove compartment
of a sanitation truck.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.447
Police are baffled.

23:27.698 --> 23:28.948
This just in.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.535
Presidential military adviser
Colonel Denton Walters

23:32.745 --> 23:36.706
has been captured during an
aborted attempt to free our hostages.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.043
This tape was delivered
to us just moments ago.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.462
They are treating me good here.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.882
The food is tasty and nourishing.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.551
The peaceful leader
of this country

23:48.719 --> 23:51.304
has asked me to appeal
to you, Mr. President

23:51.555 --> 23:56.059
to stop your vicious, imperialistic
tactics around the globe.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.661
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a warm welcome

24:14.912 --> 24:17.664
to His Excellency,
the Prime Minister of Japan

24:17.915 --> 24:21.251
Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.758
The president of the United States,
Thomas Benson.

24:30.094 --> 24:34.180
Mr. President, this is Prime Minister
Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.183
President Benson,
where's your first lady?

24:37.434 --> 24:41.479
I don't know. I've had lots of women.
Lost my flower at the age of 15.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.022
I can't keep track.

24:43.274 --> 24:45.608
Let's get this over with.
I feel ill.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.195
My intestines were removed during
action in the North Atlantic.

24:49.446 --> 24:53.867
Took a torpedo in the gut.
My bowels were replaced with hemp.

24:54.118 --> 24:57.036
- Clogs easily.
- I hope you feel better.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.205
Well, my lips to yours.

25:08.883 --> 25:12.802
The junior senator
from Minnesota, Gray Edwards.

25:13.304 --> 25:16.306
President Benson,
Prime Minister Soto,

25:16.473 --> 25:18.141
ladies and gentlemen.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.477
Tonight we put election politics
aside as I join you

25:21.687 --> 25:26.357
as majority whip and chairman
of the Foreign Affairs Committee

25:26.650 --> 25:29.068
in welcoming the
Japanese prime minister

25:29.320 --> 25:33.072
and his lovely wife
to these United States.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.826
Our two great nations have begun...

25:37.036 --> 25:39.704
...what we hope will be a long
and successful dialogue.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.498
Ptooh!

25:43.000 --> 25:45.585
- Not only...
- I don't remember eating that.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.838
I feel better now.
It's that raw fish odor.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.048
It makes...

25:50.257 --> 25:51.758
Oh, God.

25:58.766 --> 26:02.018
Look at that! Those my teeth?

26:02.519 --> 26:05.021
Only to continue
in the highest spirit...

26:05.272 --> 26:07.815
Yeah. They're filthy!

26:07.900 --> 26:11.194
And so I would like
to propose a toast.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.864
- Oh, thank you, Yoko.
- I'll take that, sir.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.783
To world peace.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.535
To a clean environment.

26:20.371 --> 26:24.540
To harmony with our planet
and world prosperity.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.380
Thank you.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.386
Looking for a place
to sit, lieutenant?

26:37.388 --> 26:40.390
I must talk to the president.
Can you arrange that?

26:40.599 --> 26:44.102
- You'd be amazed what I can do.
- It's my fault they got Walters.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.561
I want to go in.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.731
You showed up just in time.
We leave in the morning.

26:48.941 --> 26:53.444
I'm taking charge of this mission.
You mind working under a woman?

26:53.654 --> 26:57.282
And now, the president of
the United States, Thomas Benson.

27:01.996 --> 27:04.580
Prime Minister Tojo,
Senator Edwards,

27:04.832 --> 27:08.960
my fellow Americans
and our millions of illegal aliens.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.463
It seems like only yesterday
I was strafing your homes.

27:12.756 --> 27:16.259
Here I am today, begging you
not to make such good cars.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.594
Excuse me.
I need a glass of water.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.431
Damn tongue's dry.
It's not mine, you know.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.434
Lost mine in Laos.
Little commie lopped it off.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.771
It's probably a doorstop somewhere.
Got this one from a basset hound.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.109
Get the car.

27:34.445 --> 27:35.987
President Benson.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.698
No, you're not.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.200
I've seen him.
He's older, about my height.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.536
Sir, this is Topper Harley.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.622
Topper. Yes, of course.
Son I never had.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.834
Well, no damn wonder
I didn't recognize you then.

27:50.044 --> 27:53.338
Word of advice,
don't call yourself the president.

27:53.547 --> 27:56.883
I wouldn't, neither should you.
It doesn't hold water.

27:57.134 --> 28:01.304
For that matter, neither do I. Let's
get away from these power cables.

28:02.639 --> 28:06.142
- I'd like to join the next mission.
- God bless you, boy.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.643
This one's on the QT.

28:07.811 --> 28:11.314
It's called "Secret Mission to
Get Walters and Our Boys Back."

28:11.523 --> 28:15.151
When you come back, I'm gonna
throw you wonderful guys a party.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.820
And there should be plenty to eat.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.656
I doubt more than half
of you will return.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.913
Thank you.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.166
Got a light, lieutenant?

28:30.334 --> 28:32.168
I quit smoking.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.670
Besides, I don't think
it's allowed here.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.007
What are they gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?

28:48.852 --> 28:53.689
- I know what to get you for Christmas.
- A Thighmaster? I've broken three.

28:53.899 --> 28:54.941
Really?

28:55.192 --> 28:58.403
Let's go to my apartment
and discuss our mission.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.405
I'm putty in your hands.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.866
In my hands, nothing turns to putty.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.893
Hmm.

30:09.892 --> 30:10.933
Hm?

30:29.077 --> 30:30.453
Ah. Ah.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.141
Oh.

32:35.829 --> 32:38.497
Yippee! Woo-hoo!

32:41.918 --> 32:44.337
Yippee-ki-yay! Woo!

32:46.423 --> 32:48.924
In an emotional address
at the state capitol

32:49.134 --> 32:51.344
Nebraska Governor, Paul Burmaster,

32:51.595 --> 32:55.514
made a public apology
for his state being so flat.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.690
Where are you?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.443
I don't know.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.487
What's wrong?

33:10.447 --> 33:12.031
My arm's asleep.

33:12.282 --> 33:14.283
No, something else.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.203
My leg too.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.955
Please, you can tell me.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.708
Well...

33:22.959 --> 33:24.502
Topper.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.630
I have to wee-wee.

33:29.341 --> 33:33.302
Look, I told myself last night
was just going to be last night.

33:34.137 --> 33:39.308
I guess I just never counted on
finding a guy so deep, so sensitive.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.895
I've fallen for you, Topper.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.356
I've fallen for you big time.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.156
There's someone else, isn't there?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.493
I have no idea what you mean.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.079
Women sense these things.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.248
I said there's no one.

34:04.418 --> 34:05.835
I'm fine.

34:06.044 --> 34:09.338
I know about Ramada, Topper.
I read your dossier.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.841
She must be quite a woman.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.010
And what if she was?

34:16.388 --> 34:17.471
Was?

34:22.601 --> 34:26.272
Last call for Train 590 for
Glendale, San Francisco and Honolulu.

34:26.523 --> 34:30.025
Board! Board!

34:33.739 --> 34:36.449
I told you. Warned you twice.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.539
Harley.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.458
- Topper Harley.
- Right here.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.140
I cannot go with you
or ever see you again.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.976
Just believe that I love you.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.895
You must be brave, my darling.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.981
This card is printed
on recycled paper.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.266
Sergeant pick that up.
Someone could trip over it.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.362
Which one of you
is Michelle Huddleston?

35:57.322 --> 35:58.823
She is.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.284
I'm glad you're here.
The hostages are being moved.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.787
I'm Commander Armin Harbinger.
I'm in charge.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.122
Sorry, commander.
Presidential orders.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.874
We're in charge now.

36:10.544 --> 36:12.044
- Any questions?
- No, ma'am.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.133
Harley, I've been there.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.637
I've seen the enemy. If you're
not ready, you won't make it.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.722
I've fired a couple of guns.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.685
I'll assemble the men,
with your permission.

36:33.066 --> 36:37.570
Gentlemen, Ms. Huddleston, CIA,
and Lieutenant Topper Harley.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.405
We're working for them.

36:39.656 --> 36:43.659
Williams, com sync pac ram set
MOS 92-H tact op spec patty-wack.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.328
- Patty-wack?
- Give a dog a bone, sir.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.163
Of course.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.917
Rabinowitz, demolition. Can't wait
to blow something up for you.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.836
I look forward to it.

36:54.379 --> 36:58.507
Commander Harbinger advised me we
have 11 hours to free the prisoners.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.926
After that, we may lose them forever.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.680
This is the prison camp area.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.851
It's heavily guarded, but they won't
expect an attack from the jungle.

37:09.060 --> 37:13.188
Your contact, code name Bench Press,
will lead you to the camp.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.608
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.026
Good luck.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.699
Topper!

37:26.786 --> 37:29.079
I know we haven't had
much time together

37:29.289 --> 37:33.709
but when you go into battle,
take something of mine with you.

37:39.215 --> 37:40.799
Your lucky mole.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.819
Topper, what are you reading?

38:42.112 --> 38:43.445
Great Expectations.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.949
- Is it any good?
- It's not all I hoped for.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.285
Know what I'm gonna do if we make it?

38:50.537 --> 38:55.040
I'm gonna go back to Eagle River
and marry my gal, Edith Mae.

38:55.875 --> 38:59.628
Gonna get us a nice little place
with a white picket fence.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.296
You know the kind.

39:01.798 --> 39:03.465
Two-car garage.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.884
Maybe a fishing boat.

39:06.136 --> 39:09.013
And in 15 years,
when they're all paid for,

39:09.222 --> 39:12.558
I'll set my charges
and blow the shit out of them.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.729
You got a girl, Topper?

39:20.567 --> 39:23.819
Penny to Sky King, no parents
in sight. Party is on.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.405
Green, green, green...

39:26.656 --> 39:27.990
Hook up.

39:35.248 --> 39:40.085
Geronimo!

39:42.380 --> 39:44.048
Me!

39:55.185 --> 39:56.226
Ahh.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.723
Thanks, brothers.

41:36.870 --> 41:38.328
Jeez!

41:51.467 --> 41:52.968
Stop it!

41:59.392 --> 42:01.643
- Ramada.
- Topper.

42:01.853 --> 42:05.314
- What are you doing here?
- This is Bench Press, our contact.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.566
- I didn't know.
- You know each other?

42:07.817 --> 42:10.027
Yes. Yes, we do.

42:10.320 --> 42:12.154
It's been a long time.

42:12.989 --> 42:16.325
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was The Flurvian Sea.

42:17.577 --> 42:19.995
- You remember?
- I remember every detail.

42:20.163 --> 42:24.917
The sky was blue. You wore gray.
I was in chiffon.

42:25.168 --> 42:28.003
Topper, there's so much to say.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.214
You're as pretty
as when you dumped me.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.174
You've changed.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.929
That beauty mark.

42:39.515 --> 42:42.559
It was a... It's a gift.

42:43.186 --> 42:45.854
Very touching,
but it's no time to reminisce.

42:46.064 --> 42:50.067
We must be at the rendezvous point
in seven hours or we miss our pickup.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.194
It's your show, hero.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.364
Let's move out.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.408
Follow me.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.921
We're late. I know a shortcut.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.887
- The meat's smoking.
- Shut up.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.932
- Let's take it off the grill.
- Leave me alone.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.935
- Frank, you're drunk again.
- Whose fault is that?

43:30.066 --> 43:32.818
This is the best way
to the prison compound.

43:33.069 --> 43:35.779
They see many boats,
so they won't be suspicious.

43:35.989 --> 43:38.448
There are clothes in the wheelhouse.

43:40.118 --> 43:43.912
Somebody once wrote,
"Hell is the impossibility of reason."

43:44.664 --> 43:47.916
That's what this place
feels like. Hell.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.961
I hate it already,
and it's only been a few hours.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.463
I'm so tired. We get up at 5:00...

43:53.673 --> 43:56.758
At first I thought
they'd handed me the wrong dossier.

43:56.926 --> 43:59.303
I couldn't believe
they wanted him dead.

43:59.512 --> 44:02.431
Third generation West Point.
Top of his class.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.308
Korea, Airborne,

44:04.517 --> 44:08.478
about a thousand decorations,
et cetera, et cetera.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.775
I loved you in Wall Street!

44:29.625 --> 44:34.004
An enemy control boat has changed
course and is heading for our people.

44:34.213 --> 44:35.630
Send the alert.

44:37.467 --> 44:39.801
Hello, Lucky. Report my signal.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.511
Report my signal. Over.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.639
Hello, George Mike Walters.
Strength three. Over.

44:44.807 --> 44:48.810
Recon reports Indians
on the warpath in your area. Over.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.354
No Indians here. Over.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.149
Do not take literally.
Repeat. Do not take literally.

44:54.359 --> 44:57.027
The vultures are circling
the carcass. Repeat.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.738
The vultures are circling the carcass.

44:59.989 --> 45:01.823
I see a couple of gulls, but...

45:01.991 --> 45:05.160
Pit bull's out of the cage.
Crips are raiding the store.

45:06.996 --> 45:08.580
Hey, you yanking my crank?

45:21.260 --> 45:24.429
They see a woman, they will
know we are masquerading.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.224
Only men are allowed
to do the fishing.

45:32.397 --> 45:34.022
Topper.

45:34.357 --> 45:36.525
Why did you have to come here now?

45:36.943 --> 45:39.694
Of all the missions
in all the jungles...

45:39.904 --> 45:43.031
...you had to walk into this one.
- I tried to stay away.

45:43.241 --> 45:46.952
I thought I'd never see you again,
that you were out of my life.

45:47.203 --> 45:49.204
But it's a sequel.
I had to come.

45:49.372 --> 45:51.581
Do you know what
the critics will say?

45:51.791 --> 45:54.918
- "Same warmed-over characters..."
- Topper, stop it.

45:55.128 --> 45:59.047
You're only using this whole
casting thing as an excuse

45:59.257 --> 46:00.882
to hide what's hurting you.

46:01.384 --> 46:04.636
Hurt? Maybe. Once.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.973
But I knew this day would come.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.642
I knew one day you'd
come crawling back

46:10.893 --> 46:14.396
begging for forgiveness.
Groveling, sniveling,

46:14.605 --> 46:17.149
pleading for another chance.

46:17.400 --> 46:22.112
Sorry, sweetheart, but this all-day
sucker is down to the soggy stick.

46:22.321 --> 46:25.157
No, Topper, you don't understand.

46:25.992 --> 46:29.744
I'm married. I was married
before you and I ever met.

46:30.079 --> 46:31.496
I'm still married today.

46:31.747 --> 46:33.415
- You're joking.
- I'm not.

46:33.583 --> 46:36.418
- You've got to be.
- If I was joking I would say,

46:36.627 --> 46:40.589
"A horse walks into a bar. The
bartender says, 'Why the long face?"'

46:40.798 --> 46:42.591
You are married.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.927
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought he was dead.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.347
He worked for the CIA,
training pilots in Germany.

46:49.599 --> 46:50.682
Highest security.

46:50.933 --> 46:53.351
They told me he died
over Villenshtoben.

46:53.603 --> 46:55.437
The day before we were to go

46:55.646 --> 46:58.857
I got word he was alive,
in a hospital in Berlin.

46:59.692 --> 47:01.359
I had to go to him.

47:01.611 --> 47:03.987
They ordered me not to tell anyone.

47:05.990 --> 47:09.284
- I know how you must feel.
- You do, huh?

47:09.619 --> 47:12.204
You know how it feels
to have your heart shot

47:12.455 --> 47:14.122
and tied to the hood of a car?

47:14.373 --> 47:16.875
To be passed like
a large kidney stone?

47:17.460 --> 47:19.002
Ramada,

47:19.295 --> 47:20.670
I don't think so.

47:23.966 --> 47:25.550
Patrol boat!

47:30.515 --> 47:34.351
Remember, we're not American.
These boys aren't stupid.

47:45.238 --> 47:46.530
Where's Harbinger?

47:46.739 --> 47:48.323
Shut off your engine.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.910
Shut off your engine.
We're boarding.

48:43.713 --> 48:44.713
Hm.

49:07.903 --> 49:10.280
Kareem of Onion! Al Jarreau!

49:39.435 --> 49:40.935
Go on! Get out of here!

49:44.190 --> 49:46.316
Take that to the bank and cash it!

49:49.320 --> 49:50.695
Swim for shore!

49:55.785 --> 49:57.160
Save yourselves!

50:02.625 --> 50:05.293
Swim for it! I'll catch up.

50:05.795 --> 50:06.961
Go!

50:38.160 --> 50:39.828
Omar Sharif!

50:57.388 --> 51:01.266
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

51:14.572 --> 51:16.531
Whoa!

51:23.789 --> 51:24.789
Topper?

51:29.211 --> 51:32.589
President Benson is
returning to Washington today

51:32.965 --> 51:35.800
to speak to the nation
in what experts are calling

51:36.051 --> 51:39.387
the pivotal address
of his political career.

51:44.935 --> 51:46.895
- How is the speech coming, sir?
- Hm?

51:47.563 --> 51:49.147
Oh, I'm practicing my A's.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.608
- This look like an A to you?
- Yes, sir.

51:51.942 --> 51:52.984
All right.

51:55.237 --> 51:56.446
What's that, Bill?

51:56.655 --> 51:59.908
We just received word from Michelle.
Harley is missing.

52:00.117 --> 52:02.577
- His boat has been demolished.
- Oh, damn it!

52:03.746 --> 52:05.747
Every time I give an order,
it gets screwed up!

52:05.956 --> 52:08.249
Plan a reception,
wrong hors d'oeuvres.

52:08.417 --> 52:11.336
Appoint an ambassador,
he leaves the country.

52:11.587 --> 52:13.338
Mr. President, we need a plan.

52:13.589 --> 52:16.674
This may be our last chance
to get the hostages out.

52:17.593 --> 52:18.802
All right.

52:19.094 --> 52:21.763
Here's where we are
and here is where they are.

52:21.972 --> 52:24.933
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
- Oh, no time for prayer, Bob.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.769
- Here's the target area.
- That's Minnesota, sir.

52:27.978 --> 52:30.438
Damn it, man,
that's the genius of my plan.

52:30.648 --> 52:34.484
Why go over there to fight?
We can do it right here at home.

52:34.693 --> 52:38.446
- Sir, the enemy is over there.
- Then we'll fly them over here.

52:38.614 --> 52:41.324
Their families too.
We'll teach them to skate...

52:41.534 --> 52:44.786
- Do I have to think of everything?
- But the hostages!

52:44.995 --> 52:47.789
It is imperative that you act now!

52:54.713 --> 52:56.130
Topper?

52:58.592 --> 52:59.634
Whoooaaa.

53:06.809 --> 53:08.476
Topper! You made it!

53:12.857 --> 53:15.817
That's right, Cindy,
it's 23 minutes past the hour.

53:15.985 --> 53:20.029
And now here's the Buckinghams
with Kind of a Drag.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.204
You're bleeding.

53:28.664 --> 53:30.164
I'll be all right.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.418
Something else
bothers me a lot more.

53:34.086 --> 53:38.423
Harbinger, where were you
when the patrol boat arrived?

53:38.841 --> 53:42.051
Below, sweeping the boat for bombs.
What are you accusing me of?

53:42.553 --> 53:46.180
Nothing, yet.
But I want you to know I smell a rat.

53:46.348 --> 53:49.267
Don't push me.
Before you bagged your first babe,

53:49.518 --> 53:52.562
I was slitting throats
for a living.

53:52.771 --> 53:57.859
I'm not saying I don't trust you,
and I'm not saying I do. But I don't.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.570
Save it for the enemy.
We got a job to do.

54:08.704 --> 54:10.955
Oh, look. I'm cut too.

54:11.206 --> 54:12.206
Oh.

54:14.877 --> 54:17.712
They got me too. It's a real gusher.

54:19.757 --> 54:21.215
Let's get going.

54:50.955 --> 54:53.081
There's a guard at the gate.

54:53.457 --> 54:54.958
He's mine.

54:55.417 --> 54:56.834
Wait here.

54:58.462 --> 54:59.754
Topper.

55:04.259 --> 55:06.761
- Topper.
- Jesus!

55:06.929 --> 55:09.597
Before we go in,
you should know something.

55:09.848 --> 55:13.267
- What now?
- Have you heard of Dexter Hayman?

55:13.477 --> 55:14.978
The freedom fighter?

55:15.187 --> 55:19.357
Yeah, he won the Nobel Prize
for inventing the artificial appendix.

55:19.608 --> 55:23.528
Exactly.
Dexter is one of the captives.

55:24.446 --> 55:27.115
- He's my husband.
- You've got to be joking.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.367
If I was joking, I would say,

55:29.618 --> 55:32.620
"A rabbi, a priest and a minister
walk into a bar..."

55:32.788 --> 55:34.330
Okay, he is your husband.

55:34.540 --> 55:37.375
Topper, I was so young,
just a schoolgirl.

55:37.626 --> 55:40.670
He was an older man,
so wise in the ways of the world.

55:41.005 --> 55:44.173
He used to come around
the schoolyard, day after day.

55:44.383 --> 55:46.884
I so admired his persistence.

55:47.136 --> 55:51.139
Even the restraining order my parents
slapped on him was no deterrent.

55:51.640 --> 55:56.019
He opened my eyes to the arts,
music, clog-dancing, WrestleMania.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.230
His work has meant so much to so many.

55:59.648 --> 56:01.983
And I owe him everything, Topper.

56:02.234 --> 56:03.317
Everything.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.486
I'm happy for you, kid.

56:06.321 --> 56:09.407
But if you think you can hurt
me again, you're wrong.

56:09.825 --> 56:12.326
I left my heart in my other pants.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.231
Go.

57:34.159 --> 57:35.201
Oy!

57:40.290 --> 57:41.499
Ah!

57:43.252 --> 57:45.128
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

59:10.505 --> 59:11.547
Ah!

59:27.439 --> 59:28.522
Mm!

59:37.658 --> 59:39.408
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

59:43.038 --> 59:44.288
The Iraqi coast.

59:44.539 --> 59:47.250
Oh, those bluffs look treacherous.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.253
Hadn't counted on that.

59:50.587 --> 59:55.049
But if God is on our side, we will
rendezvous on Lincoln's wart by noon.

59:55.550 --> 59:57.134
That's it, men.

59:58.971 --> 01:00:00.471
We're going in!

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:04.892
My rescue mission was underway.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:07.937
But two things kept running
through my mind.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:10.147
Would we get to the men in time?

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:12.900
And why did I bring helium
instead of air?

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.246
I'll go to the rear.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.501
Take the front door.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.199
The keys.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.393
- What?
- Enough!

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:51.392
I'll have a hamburger.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:04.905
- Where are the prisoners?
- There.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.950
- Let's go!
- I'll take the back gate.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.504
Now, that's a hell of a gun.

01:03:24.426 --> 01:03:27.761
- Where's Dexter Hayman?
- Villa compound 405.

01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:41.275
Okay. I'm here.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:43.194
"Terrorist Mountain."

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:46.947
"It's a Small War."
"Pirates of the Persian Gulf."

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:51.619
"Hostage Mover."
Ah! "Dexter's Dungeon."

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:08.677
Harbinger, what are you doing here?

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:13.474
I was right, wasn't I?
You sabotaged the other missions.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:16.393
- I find that unacceptable.
- You got me wrong.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.145
All these years,

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:21.357
fighting, and shooting and killing.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:26.737
I just... I can't go on. I...

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:32.660
Hey, hey, hey, rainy face!
Hey, proud warrior.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:38.707
Let the sun come out,
you big bad G.I. Joe.

01:04:40.168 --> 01:04:44.213
You know, kitten, we all have
permission to make mistakes.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:46.590
It's called "learning."

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:53.055
You give your Uncle Topper

01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.349
a nice big blow.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:19.373
I'm done.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:24.962
Thattaboy.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.724
Thanks. I can kill again.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.226
- You've given me a reason to live.
- Good.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:42.563
Head for the gate. Plenty of bad guys
to shoot on the way.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:57.328
Keeps going,
and going, and going, and going.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:58.996
Nothing outlasts the...

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.664
Oh!

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.334
Yes!

01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:58.389
There's a copter pad half a mile away.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.267
- That's our ticket out.
- We can't leave. Not without Dexter.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:05.562
Topper! Watch out!

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:44.184
For a moment there,
I thought you were...

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:45.728
Gabriella Sabatini?

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:51.024
I get that all the time.
It must be the nose.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.652
Ironically, I haven't picked up
a racket in years.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.280
You saved my life.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:08:01.452
Topper, no matter what happens,
I want you to know that

01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.496
I never stopped loving you.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:08.041
Let's move out!

01:08:09.669 --> 01:08:11.920
You know how to get to the copter pad.

01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:13.881
If I'm not there in 15,
you know what to do.

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:18.343
- We get the hell out of here.
- No! Wait another 15 minutes.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:22.096
We could hear gunfire
from the compound.

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:25.142
From out of nowhere,
a patrol boat appeared.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:29.188
How would we get past the soldiers
on that boat?

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:33.149
Then, suddenly, it happened.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.710
Take cover!

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.469
Guys.

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:03.596
Jeez!

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:05.640
That's it, good night.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.573
War. It's fantastic!

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:17.880
Drop the gun!

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:21.884
Drop it!

01:10:24.596 --> 01:10:29.641
You will die, Yankee bastard man.
How you say? Like a dog.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.644
Now march!

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.773
March!

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:45.866
I kill you where you stand,
you imperialist Yankee-Doodle dork.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.061
Slippery rascal!

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.822
Butcher of Baghdad. Hello?

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.369
Well, hello.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:31.620
Who is it? Who is it?

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:36.917
- Your wife, Hillary Rodham Hussein.
- Jesus! I'm so stupid!

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:39.086
I was supposed to pick her up.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.089
Tell her I'm at the gym.
No, I'm out of town.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.092
On business. Bombing,
gassing, execution.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:49.221
- Something. Make it up.
- I'm sorry. Just missed him.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.224
I owe you one.

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:05.487
Ali MacGraw! My eyes.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:13.161
You little...!
I'm going to split you like a melon!

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.209
Now I will kill you
until you die from it.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.794
In a pig's ear.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.465
- Mr. President!
- Suffering succotash!

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:30.595
Looks like the upper hand is on
the other foot, Saddam.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.847
Ah-ha.

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.642
Uh-oh!

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.019
Yes!

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:41.314
My skin's made of asbestos.

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:44.276
Tanning parlor accident
at Dien Bien Phu.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:48.196
Go on about your business.
I got a bone to settle with this guy.

01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:50.407
Yes, sir. I'll get Dexter.

01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:52.617
Let's make this a fair fight.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.709
I've been waiting for you, O Big One.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:04.713
We meet at last.
The circle is complete.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:09.551
- Now I am the master!
- Only the master of evil, Saddam.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.013
Your powers are...

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.438
Your powers are weak.
You shouldn't have come.

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:25.108
Well, I have.
We'll settle this the old Navy way.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:28.028
First guy to die, loses!

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:42.751
Water. Water! Water, please.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:46.004
- It's locked. From the inside.
- No!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.340
- Damn it!
- We're gonna die!

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.175
- Get ahold of yourself!
- Blow it!

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.803
- It's not our property.
- Do it. Do it!

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:55.889
Oh, Mr. Geppetto!

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:02.229
Go ahead. Shoot.
You'll get nothing from me.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.982
You are filth.
I spit in the face of filth.

01:14:06.234 --> 01:14:09.528
- I've come to get you out of here.
- You're American.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:12.697
Yes, from America. Let's go.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:16.827
My friend, I yearn for freedom
as much as anyone

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:19.204
but I run from no man.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:20.747
You've got to come with me.

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:23.917
I can't walk.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.129
They've tied my shoelaces together.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.632
A knot.

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:34.594
Bastards.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:48.108
I'm aborting the mission.
Envelope is closed. We're lifting off.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.696
Here you go. It's $4.50.

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.407
I didn't think you'd make it.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.534
Onboard. We're getting out.

01:14:57.785 --> 01:15:00.620
What about the others?
We just can't leave them.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:23.977
Wait! I can't go any further.
I need a drink.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:32.736
Okay. Right a bit.
Whoa, stop there.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:38.283
Down a bit, down a bit. There.
It's not very cold. Is this filtered?

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:41.870
Their artillery will be down
on us soon. We have to go.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:44.331
No! We'll lose Topper and Dexter.

01:15:44.916 --> 01:15:48.168
But that's been the idea all along,
hasn't it, Michelle?

01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:56.426
You're looking beautiful as ever,
Ramada. How did you know?

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:59.888
I didn't. It all came together
when I saw you here.

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:02.599
I remembered your inscription
in my yearbook.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.685
You wrote, "Remember the fun
we had in class

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:08.605
"and I'll fuck up your life
if it's the last thing I do."

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:12.984
And then I realize where I had
last seen this.

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:24.246
What could I have done to make
you so vindictive?

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.290
Goodness sake. You know each other.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.085
Oh, Ramada, how could you
have been so blind?

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:34.089
You were too wrapped up in being
Miss Perfect College to notice me.

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:38.301
Why concern yourself with the feelings
of one insignificant roommate?

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:43.556
One fabulous day,
one incredible experience.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.976
I had no idea it meant so much to you.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.520
I remember that day
as if it were yesterday.

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:50.772
The exhilaration of experimenting,

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:54.943
sharing something so new,
so dangerous,

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:58.989
- so intimate.
- Go on.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.825
And I'll never forget
the look on your face.

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:04.536
The way the sweat glistened
on your hard body.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:06.538
Then you tied my ankles.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:09.916
Tighter. Tighter.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:13.420
But it just wasn't right.
It wasn't natural.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:16.840
Bungee-jumping is just too
dangerous a sport.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.967
Bungee-jumping? That's it?

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:23.054
How could you hurt so many
innocent people?

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:26.099
Oh, Ramada! It was always
so easy for you.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:27.767
How could you understand?

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:32.939
I had Dexter imprisoned
because I wanted you to suffer

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.942
- as much as you made me suffer.
- You fool!

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:42.574
When I discovered I couldn't win
Topper because

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:45.368
he loved you,
I tried to have you killed.

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:49.539
He... He still loves me.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.419
You turned your back on America

01:17:55.546 --> 01:17:58.673
because of your jealousy.
You're gonna pay for this.

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:09.017
Good doggy!

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:26.242
Ew.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:27.994
Ah-huh!

01:18:30.623 --> 01:18:33.792
Aluminum siding. Ten-year guarantee.
No paint needed.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.616
Hm.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.682
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:33.601
Ha! You missed!

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:37.564
It'll take more than that
to stop me, you devils!

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.190
Don't jiggle me.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.319
Advil! Midol! Get over here!
To the helicopter.

01:19:43.571 --> 01:19:46.531
They dicked with the wrong dictator.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:48.616
This means war!

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:53.830
You better let me handle this, son.

01:19:55.166 --> 01:19:56.791
Ew. You're so sweaty.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:59.002
- I knew you'd make it.
- It's about time.

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.299
- Michelle.
- She's our saboteur.

01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.844
Can you get me off
for old times' sake?

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:12.682
Sorry, precious. You sold
out the greatest country in the world.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:17.187
And to think I wore your mole.
Get her out of here.

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.568
Dexter?

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:25.945
Ramada.

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:35.163
Oh, dear Dexter. Look what they've
done to your shoelaces.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:39.959
Oh, my darling. You've no idea what
I've just been through.

01:20:40.211 --> 01:20:43.796
But now we're together again.
We have much to look forward to.

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:48.176
I want to do it all.
Donahue. Geraldo.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:52.263
Sally Jessy. Oh, and who's
that black chick?

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:56.809
- Oprah.
- Yes! Yes. Her too.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.734
Let's go! It's getting hot here.

01:21:04.944 --> 01:21:06.986
I'm going back for the president.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:08.696
Topper!

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.407
I'm staying here with you.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:14.661
Get on that helicopter with
Dexter, where you belong.

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:17.121
Why? I thought you loved me.

01:21:17.331 --> 01:21:20.083
Ramada, I do love you.
I've tried to forget you

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:23.461
but no matter what, your face
is on the tip of my tongue.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:24.837
Then let me stay with you.

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:28.341
Ramada, I want to be with you.
I want to hold you.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.635
Meet your parents and pet your dog.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.346
My parents are dead. My dog ate them.

01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:37.934
I'm sorry. We both know you
belong with Dexter.

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:41.062
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:45.608
I'm not being noble, but do you have
any idea what'd happen if you stay?

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:47.110
Of course I do.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:51.656
Sex. Wild, free, passionate,
unbridled sex.

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:54.409
I'd fondle you in ways
you can't imagine.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:58.371
I would pleasure you at any time,
in any place, in any way,

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:01.082
for as long as you could
possibly desire.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:12.218
You better get going.
You'll miss your takeoff.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:18.766
Goodbye, Topper. God bless you.

01:22:19.018 --> 01:22:21.603
Wait, let me get a shot of you two.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:25.231
It'll be great for the talk shows.
Let's frame this up.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:29.319
Closer together. Come on.
Don't be shy.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:30.695
Put your arm around her.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:33.823
I've almost got it.
This is a great shot.

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:36.284
My God, you're gonna love this!

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:41.205
You know, under other circumstances,
you'd make a great couple.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.959
Oh, well. Say che...

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:48.296
You're moving too much.
Quit spinning!

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:50.173
This'll make me rich and f...

01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:55.303
- He really was a wiener!
- Don't get me started.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:58.598
Hold it there! Hold it!

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:02.185
This buggy going to America?

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:04.020
I was afraid we'd lost you!

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:05.647
Lost? Not a chance.

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:07.940
Shove over! I get the window seat.

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:18.576
- They're in my sights.
- Just a second! This is personal.

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:25.083
We're too heavy.
We need to lose weight.

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:25.633
Hot Shots!
Part Deux was filmed in Hollywood

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:27.885
in front of a live studio audience.
