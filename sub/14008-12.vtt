04:22.761 --> 04:27.665
So the judge knows
I was invested with Tobin.

04:27.732 --> 04:30.769
Yeah.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.542
You can't keep your
finances secret anymore.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.979
Why didn't you tell me?

04:40.046 --> 04:43.649
I don't know,
I don't know, Patty.

04:43.717 --> 04:48.815
What's-what's-what's
the next step here?

04:50.916 --> 04:53.717
You know what you need to do.

05:14.600 --> 05:21.206
Your father never wanted anything
to happen to Tessa Marchetti.

05:21.274 --> 05:22.876
You lied to Mr. Emanuel.

05:22.944 --> 05:25.513
You told him I was on board with
this.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.447
The girl was going to
turn us in.

05:27.515 --> 05:28.681
How do you know that?

05:28.749 --> 05:30.517
Because she was found down
there with a bodyguard and

05:30.584 --> 05:33.619
the account number for the
charity.

05:35.788 --> 05:39.890
With the girl gone, how do you
plan to keep moving the money?

05:39.958 --> 05:40.691
You think of that?

05:40.759 --> 05:42.326
We've put enough
into the charity for now.

05:42.394 --> 05:43.794
Okay?

05:43.861 --> 05:45.529
We'll start again wh Emanuel
finds another courier.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.297
You should have
cleared all this with me.

05:47.365 --> 05:50.234
I warned you about Tessa
Marchetti, and you did not listen.

05:50.302 --> 05:52.269
You're an old man in over his
head, just like my father.

05:52.337 --> 05:53.737
You shut your mouth
and have some respect.

05:53.805 --> 05:56.707
You shut your mouth!

05:56.774 --> 05:58.475
I call the shots now, okay?

05:58.543 --> 06:00.510
You don't like the way I'm
running things, feel free to

06:00.578 --> 06:04.012
turn me into the authorities.

06:17.591 --> 06:20.925
You didn't tell him, did you?

06:20.993 --> 06:22.193
Hello, Lenny.

06:22.261 --> 06:25.229
Why didn't
you tell him, Marilyn?

06:25.297 --> 06:29.567
You are obviously upset, but who
is it that we're talking abt?

06:29.635 --> 06:33.737
Please do not lie to me.

06:33.804 --> 06:38.707
If you had told Joe that Tessa
was his daughter, she'd still be alive.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.610
Why didn't you tell him?

06:44.678 --> 06:45.878
I don't understand.

06:45.945 --> 06:49.016
Of course you don't understand.

06:49.084 --> 06:53.755
You don't have a family
of your own, Lenny.

06:53.823 --> 06:56.490
You don't have children.

06:58.927 --> 07:01.394
Vodka, rocks.

07:01.462 --> 07:07.701
You know what I have to do.

07:07.769 --> 07:12.772
Don't tell him, Lenny.

07:12.840 --> 07:16.042
What's the point now?

07:18.712 --> 07:23.349
So Patty gave us the evidence
we need to arrest Carol Tobin.

07:23.416 --> 07:24.984
That's good news.

07:25.051 --> 07:27.686
And you're going
to prosecute her with me.

07:27.753 --> 07:30.088
You're not firing me?

07:30.155 --> 07:33.457
Doesn't look that way.

07:33.525 --> 07:34.725
Why not?

07:34.792 --> 07:37.827
'Cause I like to win,
and your instincts, despite

07:37.895 --> 07:40.663
being completely unethical,
may be an asset.

07:40.731 --> 07:41.930
Thank you.

07:41.998 --> 07:43.966
Yeah, besides, when I
made the deal with Patty for

07:44.033 --> 07:47.035
Carol Tobin, she made me
promise to keep you on.

07:47.103 --> 07:48.036
Really?

07:48.104 --> 07:51.706
So you have her to thank.

07:58.079 --> 08:00.147
You can go now.

08:02.650 --> 08:07.587
But, Ellen... one phone call to
the bar association and you're

08:07.655 --> 08:09.688
history.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.227
Come in.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.095
Thank you.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.132
Mr. DiFolco, nice
to see you again.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.069
I'd like to make
another withdrawal.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.171
Certainly.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.809
The, uh, Fund for
Africa's Future, correct?

08:29.876 --> 08:31.877
That's right.

08:35.448 --> 08:39.051
You know where to sign.

08:39.118 --> 08:41.253
How is Mr. Zedeck?

08:41.321 --> 08:42.989
Very well, thank you.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.461
I would love to meet
him in person someday.

08:45.528 --> 08:49.001
As a trustee for the
charity, he's a very busy man.

08:49.068 --> 08:51.405
Besides, Mr.
Zedeck is old-fashioned.

08:51.473 --> 08:54.442
He figures, why do anything
yourself when you can send your

08:54.510 --> 08:56.111
attorney to do it for you.

08:56.178 --> 08:57.178
Yeah.

08:57.246 --> 09:00.649
Well, give him my best.

09:00.717 --> 09:01.717
In cash?

09:01.785 --> 09:02.451
Please.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.520
The usual denominations.

09:12.931 --> 09:16.768
Special delivery.

09:16.836 --> 09:18.169
Thank you.

09:18.237 --> 09:20.237
My regards to Mr. Zedeck.

09:30.438 --> 09:32.439
Here.

09:39.077 --> 09:41.778
Well, shoot me
dead, then screw me.

09:41.845 --> 09:42.745
Satisfied?

09:42.813 --> 09:45.947
Long as you keep it
coming, your secrets are safe.

09:46.015 --> 09:48.216
You're gonna
have to be patient.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.483
Yeah, I gotcha.

09:49.551 --> 09:51.618
You got to be careful.

09:51.686 --> 09:53.019
Don't tip the mark.

09:53.087 --> 09:55.121
The Tobins are not a mark.

09:55.189 --> 09:58.924
Maybe not for you.

09:58.991 --> 10:02.393
What do you say we bag ourselves
a couple of whores, huh?

10:02.461 --> 10:04.161
My treat.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.296
I'll pass.

10:05.363 --> 10:09.165
You remember the
first time I took you?

10:09.233 --> 10:11.233
I broke you in.

10:33.251 --> 10:36.386
My resignation from the firm.

10:44.262 --> 10:48.830
So you lied to me because
you were protecting Tom.

10:48.897 --> 10:49.996
Yes.

10:50.064 --> 10:52.898
I assume you knew he
was invested with Tobin?

10:52.966 --> 10:55.301
Yes, he told
me that a while ago.

10:55.368 --> 11:01.573
And you felt it was okay
not to mention that to me?

11:01.641 --> 11:04.776
Tom was in a bad place,
and I decided he needed

11:04.844 --> 11:07.846
my loyalty more than you did.

11:12.751 --> 11:16.386
One of the reasons I didn't come
back and work for you is so I

11:16.454 --> 11:19.456
could make my own decisions.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.160
I admire that.

11:27.163 --> 11:30.598
What's gonna happen to Tom now?

11:30.666 --> 11:34.335
He's resigning for
the sake of the case.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.736
What case?

11:35.803 --> 11:40.039
You don't have one
without Tessa Marchetti.

11:40.107 --> 11:42.108
No, I don't.

11:45.745 --> 11:48.179
Maybe it's over.

11:48.247 --> 11:53.284
Maybe I'll never find the money.

11:53.351 --> 11:57.054
That doesn't sound like you.

11:57.122 --> 11:59.322
There's got to be some
angle left to play.

11:59.390 --> 12:03.126
I can only think of one.

12:03.194 --> 12:08.064
Turn the Tobins against each
other.

12:08.132 --> 12:11.702
Because we won't find the money
unless we tear that family

12:11.770 --> 12:13.771
apart.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.869
Sorry to show up unannounced.

12:31.306 --> 12:33.139
What are you doing here?

12:33.207 --> 12:36.808
Jill and I got the
chromosomal tests back.

12:36.876 --> 12:38.242
And?

12:38.310 --> 12:40.010
Flying colors.

12:40.078 --> 12:43.112
Third trimester is a breeze.

12:43.180 --> 12:46.581
Glad to hear that.

12:46.648 --> 12:50.118
I know you were worried before.

12:50.185 --> 12:52.191
You asked me about paternity.

12:52.258 --> 12:55.631
I just want you to be sure.

12:55.699 --> 12:57.933
Well, I am.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.569
They checked the DNA.

13:02.636 --> 13:06.004
Kid's all mine.

13:06.072 --> 13:09.773
I'll send you a copy of the
report.

13:21.988 --> 13:23.390
I need you to sign here, Mr.

13:23.458 --> 13:27.130
Winstone, and here.

13:27.198 --> 13:28.365
He's all yours.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.068
Thank you, Officer.

13:31.136 --> 13:32.436
A bar fight? Really?

13:32.504 --> 13:34.405
The bartender
couldn't take a joke.

13:34.473 --> 13:35.272
<i>Yeah, you're a</i>

13:35.340 --> 13:36.006
joke.

13:36.074 --> 13:37.942
Keep it up, you're next...
I'll slap you around!

13:38.009 --> 13:41.879
Shut up! Screw up again and
we're done, you hear me?

13:48.220 --> 13:50.254
Donna?

13:50.322 --> 13:51.822
Hi.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.623
Sorry to get you out of bed.

13:53.691 --> 13:55.858
Well, you know I don't sleep.

13:55.926 --> 13:57.693
I didn't say you were sleeping.

13:57.761 --> 13:58.727
Thanks for the call.

13:58.795 --> 14:02.063
You know, next time it's gonna
cost you dinner and a movie.

14:02.131 --> 14:04.332
You got a tip for me?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.233
I might.

14:05.301 --> 14:08.235
You asked me to keep an eye out
for anything on the Tobins.

14:08.303 --> 14:09.136
Yeah?

14:09.204 --> 14:13.408
Well, there was an arrest
you may want to look into.

14:15.877 --> 14:18.278
In my efforts to aid
the victims of Louis Tobin's

14:18.346 --> 14:21.850
historic fraud, I purposely
misled my clients... and my

14:21.917 --> 14:23.018
colleagues.

14:23.085 --> 14:26.821
I failed to disclose that I,
too, had fallen victim to Mr.

14:26.888 --> 14:29.221
Tobin's crime.

14:29.289 --> 14:33.456
My partner in the firm, Patty
Hewes, remained entirely unaware

14:33.523 --> 14:36.624
of my financial status.

14:36.692 --> 14:39.493
And in willfully hiding my
agenda from her I created a

14:39.560 --> 14:43.295
conflict of interest that put
my firm and our entire case...

14:43.363 --> 14:46.398
at risk.

14:46.465 --> 14:49.672
For this, I feel deep
shame and regret.

14:49.740 --> 14:53.245
Therefore, effective immediately,
I am resigning from

14:53.312 --> 14:57.215
the firm, as I recognize it's
impossible for me to continue to

14:57.283 --> 15:03.522
work alongside those whose trust I so...
completely violated.

15:09.027 --> 15:14.199
I was happy to hear from you.

15:14.266 --> 15:18.970
I was thinking about
our last conversation.

15:19.038 --> 15:23.241
I'm ready to accept your offer.

15:23.308 --> 15:26.405
You've made the
right decision, Jill.

15:30.736 --> 15:35.036
I want you to know that
this was not easy for me.

15:35.104 --> 15:37.205
I love your son.

15:37.273 --> 15:40.107
Yeah, of course you do.

15:40.175 --> 15:43.911
"Burnham." Is that with a "H"?

15:43.979 --> 15:48.348
B-U-R-N-H-A-M.

15:48.416 --> 15:51.351
I really believe this
is the best thing.

15:51.419 --> 15:53.352
For both me and Michael.

15:53.420 --> 15:57.822
$200,000 will buy
everyone a lot of happiness.

15:57.890 --> 16:01.594
Make it $500,000.

16:01.662 --> 16:05.431
I'd like to think your son's life
is worth at least that much.

16:05.498 --> 16:10.368
And if you want me out of it,
that's what it's gonna cost you.

16:23.313 --> 16:24.914
You leave tonight.

16:24.981 --> 16:27.985
You don't even say good-bye.

16:36.263 --> 16:40.433
So, my contact gave
me a tip, and, uh, I did some

16:40.500 --> 16:46.572
research... and I think you
might be able to use this.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.073
For what?

16:48.141 --> 16:50.942
The Tobin case.

16:51.010 --> 16:55.046
Now, I'm going to hold off
writing about this for now.

16:55.114 --> 17:01.520
Whatever you and Patty get from it...
I want the inside story.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.089
Thank you.

17:04.156 --> 17:12.329
See, I told you someday we could...
help each other out.

17:12.397 --> 17:16.501
Albert Wiggins...
arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.

17:16.569 --> 17:20.538
Leonard
Winstone bailed him out.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.207
Who's Albert Wiggins?

17:22.273 --> 17:25.910
He has a record in seven
states going back 50 years.

17:25.978 --> 17:29.781
Bank fraud, theft, forgery.

17:29.849 --> 17:32.517
So why is Leonard Winstone
representing him?

17:32.585 --> 17:35.753
Winstone's CV says he
graduated from Guilford Law

17:35.821 --> 17:38.555
School, but according
to the registrar...

17:38.623 --> 17:40.891
There was no Leonard
Winstone who went to Guilford.

17:40.958 --> 17:43.793
No, there was, but he
died in a car accident a few

17:43.861 --> 17:45.495
weeks after graduation.

17:45.563 --> 17:48.831
So the man who's acting
as the Tobins' lawyer is

17:48.899 --> 17:50.867
not Leonard Winstone.

17:50.934 --> 17:52.802
Apparently not.

17:52.870 --> 17:55.371
Who is he?

17:55.439 --> 18:00.343
Turns out Albert
Wiggins had a son.

18:00.410 --> 18:03.246
Lester Wiggins.

18:03.314 --> 18:06.916
He was arrested in 1984.

19:15.160 --> 19:18.693
You okay there, Patricia?

19:26.671 --> 19:32.075
I was always in my father's
shadow, so I blamed him

19:32.143 --> 19:37.180
for a lot of my problems because
I was invisible to the man.

19:37.247 --> 19:40.582
I never had his respect,
so I acted out.

19:40.650 --> 19:46.787
I was very...
self-destructive for a long time.

19:46.855 --> 19:52.391
But now he's dead...
and I haven't had a drink since the

19:52.459 --> 19:55.561
night he died.

19:55.628 --> 20:01.201
Now that my father's gone, my
family needs me to take charge...

20:02.270 --> 20:06.906
...and step in... make...

20:08.375 --> 20:11.242
...some tough decisions.

20:11.310 --> 20:15.779
So, in spite of everything
that's happened to us, I'm

20:15.847 --> 20:18.348
grateful in a way.

20:19.515 --> 20:23.651
'Cause it's given me some
purpose...

20:26.555 --> 20:29.157
...helped me to stay sober.

20:32.594 --> 20:35.596
You shouldn't have
kept this from Patty.

20:35.664 --> 20:36.263
I told you.

20:36.331 --> 20:37.030
I-I had my reasons.

20:37.098 --> 20:38.901
Now you have no salary, and
that's all that was keeping

20:38.969 --> 20:39.569
us afloat.

20:39.637 --> 20:41.038
Will you just relax?

20:41.106 --> 20:42.205
I can handle this.

20:42.273 --> 20:44.239
I'll figure this whole thing
out.

20:44.307 --> 20:45.174
And until then?

20:45.242 --> 20:46.607
What are we supposed to do?

20:46.675 --> 20:47.608
We keep selling.

20:47.676 --> 20:50.243
I put the townhouse on the
market.

20:50.311 --> 20:51.244
What?

20:51.312 --> 20:53.279
I didn't want to
have to argue with you.

20:53.347 --> 20:54.313
That's bullshit!

20:54.381 --> 20:55.714
I can't live like this.

20:55.782 --> 20:57.415
Well, we don't
have any other choice.

20:57.483 --> 20:59.350
You can ask Patty for help.

20:59.418 --> 21:01.752
Any contact between us
can jeopardize her standing

21:01.820 --> 21:02.755
with the court.

21:02.823 --> 21:04.258
And you're concerned about her?

21:04.325 --> 21:05.992
How many hits have you taken
for Patty over the years?

21:06.060 --> 21:06.759
I can handle this.

21:06.827 --> 21:07.426
How?

21:07.493 --> 21:08.093
I'm fine.

21:08.161 --> 21:09.694
How are you going to handle it?

21:09.762 --> 21:11.298
Just do what I ask you to do.

21:11.366 --> 21:12.233
No, I am your wife.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.933
Look, I don't have
to deal with this right now.

21:14.001 --> 21:14.701
Don't ask any more questions.

21:14.769 --> 21:15.769
I... no, I am your wife.

21:15.836 --> 21:17.536
You don't want to know.

21:17.604 --> 21:24.206
Will you just shut up for a second
and let me fix it just once?!

21:24.274 --> 21:29.148
I don't want Megan and
Charlie to see you like this.

21:29.215 --> 21:33.494
What the hell does that mean?

21:33.561 --> 21:40.565
It means I don't want you here.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.600
Don't come home tonight.

21:43.668 --> 21:48.304
- Deb...
- No.

21:52.175 --> 21:54.209
Who is it?

21:54.277 --> 21:56.813
Ellen Parsons.

21:58.548 --> 22:01.484
From the district attorney's
office.

22:01.552 --> 22:03.520
I know who you are.

22:03.588 --> 22:06.957
I have something for you.

22:07.025 --> 22:09.360
What's that?

22:09.428 --> 22:13.632
The truth about your attorney.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.808
What the hell?

22:23.875 --> 22:25.643
Your whole world
is about to collapse.

22:25.711 --> 22:26.577
You need to go, Ms.

22:26.645 --> 22:27.578
Parsons.

22:27.646 --> 22:28.612
Talk to me, Joe.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.679
Maybe you can still save your
family.

22:30.747 --> 22:31.346
Get out.

22:31.414 --> 22:35.284
Is there someone
else you can trust?

22:46.168 --> 22:47.102
Hello.

22:47.169 --> 22:48.737
Mr. Winstone.

22:48.805 --> 22:50.007
It's Tom Shayes.

22:50.075 --> 22:51.612
What a surprise.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.615
How are you?

22:52.682 --> 22:54.049
I've been better.

22:54.116 --> 22:57.416
I saw you on television, Mr.
Shayes.

22:57.483 --> 23:01.689
I'm sorry about what's happening to you...
but I'm not sure why

23:01.757 --> 23:02.958
you're calling me.

23:03.026 --> 23:07.827
I'm-I'm losing my family, Mr.
Winstone, my home.

23:07.895 --> 23:09.762
I... I don't know what to do.

23:09.830 --> 23:11.997
And what do you want from me?

23:12.065 --> 23:14.231
I'd like to see you, please.

23:14.299 --> 23:18.434
I'd-I'd like to talk to you.

23:18.502 --> 23:23.036
I'm afraid
that's just not possible.

23:49.786 --> 23:52.186
Ma'am, are you all right?

23:56.457 --> 23:58.858
Need a doctor?

23:58.926 --> 24:01.026
Ma'am?

24:04.130 --> 24:08.532
What are you doing out here all
alone?

24:10.034 --> 24:14.402
Ma'am, you sure you
don't need a doctor?

24:20.707 --> 24:25.609
So Deb kicked you out?

24:25.677 --> 24:28.344
Yeah.

24:28.412 --> 24:33.414
She wanted me to ask Patty for
money.

24:33.481 --> 24:40.118
Where are you going to stay?

24:40.186 --> 24:43.723
I don't know.

24:43.791 --> 24:47.060
You're welcome
to come to my place.

24:47.128 --> 24:49.463
Aren't you seeing some guy?

24:49.531 --> 24:53.468
I'll just send
him home for the night.

24:53.536 --> 24:55.538
I'm okay.

24:55.605 --> 24:59.375
I'll be fine.

24:59.443 --> 25:04.017
Maybe you should go
to Patty for help if you think

25:04.084 --> 25:08.489
that it-it-it might help you
keep your family together.

25:08.557 --> 25:13.296
Askatty to support
my entire extended family?

25:16.534 --> 25:24.743
You know this job with Patty...
it was the greatest thing...

25:24.811 --> 25:28.481
I've ever had in my life, and
yeh, it looks like it might

25:28.549 --> 25:32.719
cost me my family.

25:39.560 --> 25:44.263
You want to sign the lease?

25:44.331 --> 25:46.332
No. Sure, Joe, that's fine.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.169
I just... Why don't I
take a look at it first?

25:50.237 --> 25:53.238
I can come over right now.

25:55.741 --> 25:57.941
Of course.

25:58.009 --> 26:04.846
I have it, uh...
...right here.

26:04.914 --> 26:06.314
I'll bring it with me.

26:06.382 --> 26:09.384
See you there.

26:09.451 --> 26:13.187
Kevin and Rachel are
gonna love this, Joe.

26:13.254 --> 26:14.254
Hmm?

26:14.322 --> 26:15.255
Yeah, I hope so.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.256
And don't worry.

26:16.323 --> 26:18.624
You know, the apartment's gonna
be purchased through a trust, so

26:18.692 --> 26:20.659
the Tobin name won't appear
anywhere.

26:20.727 --> 26:22.928
Okay. Did-Did you bring
that thing I asked you for?

26:22.995 --> 26:23.929
The...?

26:23.996 --> 26:26.998
Yes. Of course.

26:32.139 --> 26:33.272
It's all here?

26:33.340 --> 26:34.706
Mm-hmm.

26:34.774 --> 26:37.942
I have something for you.

26:38.010 --> 26:41.011
Open it.

26:47.383 --> 26:49.950
Where did you get this?

26:50.018 --> 26:53.020
Why does that matter?

26:55.557 --> 26:58.795
Listen, Joe, um...

27:03.036 --> 27:06.606
...a long time ago, before I met
your father, I made mistakes.

27:06.674 --> 27:09.576
Changing your
identity is not a mistake.

27:09.643 --> 27:10.944
Oh, come on.

27:11.012 --> 27:14.952
"Lester Wiggins"?

27:15.020 --> 27:16.187
What kind of name is that?

27:16.254 --> 27:18.522
Sure, I changed it.

27:18.590 --> 27:21.727
Everything you ever told
my family is complete bullshit.

27:21.795 --> 27:23.062
That's not true.

27:23.130 --> 27:24.097
Yeah, it's true.

27:24.165 --> 27:26.333
Your father wasn't in the Air
Force.

27:26.401 --> 27:27.368
He wasn't killed in Korea.

27:27.436 --> 27:28.370
He was a criminal.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.373
- Joe...
- You weren't raised overseas.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.408
I can explain that.

27:32.475 --> 27:34.643
You're not even
a goddamned lawyer.

27:34.711 --> 27:37.179
You're not even a lawyer!

27:37.247 --> 27:40.349
The Leonard Winstone who
graduated from Guilford Law

27:40.417 --> 27:43.552
School is dead.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.588
Who the hell are you?

27:45.655 --> 27:47.590
Someone is clearly
trying to discredit me.

27:47.658 --> 27:48.591
Don't you understand that?

27:48.659 --> 27:50.760
That doesn't answer my
question, you piece of shit.

27:50.828 --> 27:53.796
Who are you?

27:53.864 --> 27:57.199
Who am I?

27:57.267 --> 28:00.302
I'm the man who has taken care
of your family for almost three

28:00.370 --> 28:01.870
decades.

28:01.938 --> 28:02.871
That's who I am.

28:02.939 --> 28:05.941
My father died without
even knowing you were a fraud.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.277
You're wrong.

28:08.344 --> 28:09.478
Jesus.

28:09.546 --> 28:12.614
I came clean to him years
ago, and he didn't care.

28:12.682 --> 28:13.615
That's it. Gd.

28:13.683 --> 28:14.649
Keep lying.

28:14.717 --> 28:17.953
You didn't know
your father the way I did.

28:18.020 --> 28:23.825
He trusted me with everything
that he kept hidden from you.

28:23.893 --> 28:24.826
Danielle.

28:24.894 --> 28:26.127
The Ponzi scheme.

28:26.195 --> 28:28.396
You told me you didn't
even know about the scheme.

28:28.464 --> 28:30.331
Of course I did.

28:31.400 --> 28:36.170
Jesus Christ.

28:36.238 --> 28:43.411
I know this is hard for
you, Joe, bneeded me.

28:43.478 --> 28:48.516
He needed a son, and all
you did is disappoint him.

28:48.583 --> 28:51.618
He knew he couldn't count on
you.

28:51.686 --> 28:54.487
You listen to me.

28:54.555 --> 28:59.293
He trained you so that you would
do whatever he wanted you to.

28:59.361 --> 29:01.829
You know what he called
you behind your back?

29:01.897 --> 29:02.831
To make me laugh?

29:02.898 --> 29:07.136
He said you were his little
monkey.

29:13.244 --> 29:19.251
If you ever come near my
family again, you're finished.

29:27.958 --> 29:29.825
Ms.
Hewes, Terry Brooke.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.226
Yeah, I was hoping
we could talk again.

29:32.294 --> 29:34.428
Thank you.

29:34.496 --> 29:37.697
Uh, I wanted to meet because I'm
still trying to figure out the

29:37.765 --> 29:40.833
character for the Frobisher
film.

29:40.900 --> 29:41.833
How's that going?

29:41.901 --> 29:44.001
Arthur's got a lot of quirks.

29:44.069 --> 29:45.702
He's an interesting guy to play.

29:45.769 --> 29:46.702
I had an experience.

29:46.769 --> 29:50.703
I'd kind of like to
get your take on it.

29:50.771 --> 29:51.704
Okay.

29:51.772 --> 29:54.473
Well, I know Arthur wants
me to see him as this dark

29:54.540 --> 29:59.408
guy, complicated, complex
and maybe he is.

29:59.476 --> 30:04.278
But I can't tell if he's
just trying to impress me.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.681
Impress you how?

30:06.749 --> 30:09.384
Well, the dude was high
on coke, so, he was either

30:09.451 --> 30:12.787
bull-shitting me, or he just said
a little more than he mnt to.

30:12.854 --> 30:13.821
What did he say?

30:13.889 --> 30:17.157
He said that during your
case against him, he hired

30:17.225 --> 30:20.693
some guy, and this guy
would do anything for him.

30:20.761 --> 30:23.798
Did Mr.
Frobisher say who he was?

30:23.867 --> 30:26.036
A cop.

30:26.104 --> 30:29.706
Art said he hired him from
some private security firm.

30:29.773 --> 30:31.574
Um, let me ask.

30:31.642 --> 30:36.111
What do you think the Frobisher
character is capable of doing?

30:36.178 --> 30:39.479
How desperate was this guy?

30:39.547 --> 30:42.182
I'm not sure
what you're asking me.

30:42.249 --> 30:43.283
I don't know.

30:44.552 --> 30:50.091
I guess murder sounds
a little too crazy.

30:50.159 --> 30:52.595
He was probably just screwing
with me.

30:53.663 --> 30:55.631
He said he murdered someone?

30:55.699 --> 31:00.068
Um, he was implying something.

31:02.939 --> 31:06.808
Arthur Frobisher is
many things, but, no...

31:09.712 --> 31:11.678
...he is not a killer.

31:11.746 --> 31:13.914
Even at his most desperate?

31:13.981 --> 31:16.283
I'sure the character
would be more fun, Mr. Brooke,

31:16.351 --> 31:19.322
but it-it just isn't true.

31:20.393 --> 31:22.498
That's just what I thought.

31:22.566 --> 31:23.634
The guy is full of shit.

31:32.911 --> 31:36.414
I wasn't expecting
to hear back from you.

31:36.482 --> 31:39.918
I hear the Tobins have cast you
aside.

31:39.985 --> 31:42.188
Joe Tobin filed papers with the
court.

31:42.256 --> 31:44.525
He revoked your authority
to represent them.

31:44.592 --> 31:48.063
Yes, well, I called
you back because I thought we

31:48.131 --> 31:51.968
might be able to help each
other.

31:52.036 --> 31:53.871
Help each other how?

31:53.938 --> 32:00.476
What if I said to you,
I could make you whole again?

32:00.544 --> 32:06.719
Restore your finances
and your reputation?

32:12.496 --> 32:16.368
In exchange for what?

32:16.436 --> 32:21.607
Immunity from prosecution.

32:21.675 --> 32:26.046
I know where the Tobin money is.

32:26.114 --> 32:27.214
Can you access it?

32:27.282 --> 32:32.986
I can get you hf of what the
Tobins stole from you up front.

32:33.054 --> 32:38.460
When you provide immunity,
you'll get you the rest.

32:38.528 --> 32:42.765
I'll give you names, account
numbers.

32:42.833 --> 32:45.234
Enough details to put them in
prison for the rest of their

32:45.302 --> 32:49.638
lives.

32:49.706 --> 32:52.808
You've worked for the
Tobin family your whole life.

32:52.875 --> 32:57.278
Why turn on them now?

32:57.346 --> 33:02.184
Joe Tobin is dangerous.

33:02.252 --> 33:06.557
You can be the hero, Mr. Shayes.

33:06.624 --> 33:09.326
You can be the one to bring down
the Tobin family when Patty

33:09.393 --> 33:12.397
Hewes couldn't.

33:16.003 --> 33:18.839
I'm gonna need the
money delivered in cash.

33:18.907 --> 33:21.776
If you can do that, I'll talk
to my friend at the D.A.'s fice

33:21.843 --> 33:24.278
about drawing up your immunity.

33:24.346 --> 33:27.148
If we do this, we
have to move quickly before the

33:27.215 --> 33:32.085
family figures out what I'm
doing.

33:32.153 --> 33:35.655
Okay, take this key to the
apartment.

33:35.723 --> 33:37.757
From now on, we meet here.

33:37.825 --> 33:39.091
I own these lofts.

33:39.159 --> 33:41.060
The building's empty.

33:41.128 --> 33:44.930
When the money is ready,
I'll contact you.

33:53.735 --> 33:54.567
Yeah?

33:54.634 --> 33:56.664
There's a Stuart Zedeck
here to see you.

33:56.732 --> 33:58.530
Oh. Uh... great.

33:58.598 --> 34:00.128
Send him in.

34:00.196 --> 34:02.194
This way, Mr. Zedeck.

34:05.227 --> 34:07.626
It is a pleasure to finally
meet you.

34:07.694 --> 34:09.827
Likewise.

34:09.893 --> 34:15.527
Um... I'm sure you'll understand, but...
I will need to see some

34:15.594 --> 34:17.159
identification, Mr. Zedeck.

34:17.226 --> 34:21.025
Uh, call me Stuart.

34:21.094 --> 34:22.159
Passport's okay?

34:22.228 --> 34:24.228
Great.

34:27.862 --> 34:30.295
Another withdrawal from the
charity?

34:30.364 --> 34:32.362
Please.

34:32.429 --> 34:34.697
What's the foundation
doing these days?

34:34.764 --> 34:35.964
Still working on the

34:36.032 --> 34:38.232
project in Tanzania.

34:38.300 --> 34:39.299
Excellent.

34:39.367 --> 34:42.600
Here.

34:42.668 --> 34:44.565
The usual denominations?

34:44.632 --> 34:46.664
Terrific.

34:46.732 --> 34:50.233
I'll be right back.

34:56.572 --> 35:01.470
I was gonna wait for you to come
home, but I was too excited.

35:01.537 --> 35:04.539
Okay, go ahead, open 'em.

35:06.608 --> 35:09.340
What do you think?

35:09.408 --> 35:13.541
Whose is this?

35:13.609 --> 35:17.478
It's yours.

35:19.647 --> 35:23.615
And the apartment that we looked
at, I put a down payment on it.

35:23.683 --> 35:24.449
What?

35:24.517 --> 35:27.118
Yeah, the maid's room can
be a nursery, and with the

35:27.185 --> 35:29.353
elevator, we don't have to lug
a stroller up the stairs.

35:29.421 --> 35:30.354
Are you nuts?

35:30.421 --> 35:31.988
We can't afford these.

35:32.056 --> 35:34.190
Oh, yes, we can.

35:34.258 --> 35:35.425
How?

35:35.493 --> 35:38.160
I sold a collection today.

35:38.228 --> 35:38.994
Whose?

35:39.062 --> 35:40.763
It's a brand-new
artist.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.264
We haven't even shown him yet.

35:42.331 --> 35:46.067
I finished the paperwork, and...
boom. (laughs)

35:46.135 --> 35:48.336
This is awesome!

35:48.404 --> 35:51.839
Okay, go ahead, get in, get in.

35:59.245 --> 36:01.912
Terry Brooke
approached you with some

36:01.979 --> 36:03.644
concerns about Arthur Frobisher?

36:03.712 --> 36:06.174
Yes, Mr.
Brooke thinks Frobisher may have hired a

36:06.242 --> 36:08.573
police officer to commit a
murder.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.608
And you think David Connor
was the victim of that murder?

36:11.676 --> 36:12.542
My fiancÃ©.

36:12.610 --> 36:15.410
Last year a detective reached
out to me saying he had

36:15.478 --> 36:16.577
information about David's death.

36:16.645 --> 36:17.445
Detective Rick Messer.

36:17.513 --> 36:19.846
Yeah. But then he was
killed in the line of duty

36:19.914 --> 36:22.015
before I ever found out what he
knew.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.250
What did Detective
Messer tell you?

36:24.317 --> 36:27.552
He said he was worried there was
corruption in the department.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.320
He thought there may have been a
cover-up surrounding my fiancÃ©'s

36:30.388 --> 36:31.188
murder.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.189
Well, I pulled everything
the department had on

36:33.257 --> 36:37.958
Messer, his, uh, entire
history with the NYPD.

36:38.026 --> 36:42.261
It's a list of his partners, his
commendations... closed cases,

36:42.329 --> 36:45.263
cases he was still working on.

36:45.331 --> 36:46.731
What, Ellen?

36:46.798 --> 36:50.700
Messer's former partner.

36:50.768 --> 36:52.769
I know this guy.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.679
His name is Wes Krulik.

37:10.618 --> 37:14.621
When you hearhe tone,
please leave a message.

37:16.624 --> 37:19.626
Wes, it's Ellen.

37:19.694 --> 37:23.096
I don't know where you are or...
if this number still works,

37:23.164 --> 37:27.834
but...
I need to talk to you.

37:39.047 --> 37:40.915
Mr. Shayes.

37:40.982 --> 37:42.984
The first installment.

37:49.191 --> 37:51.161
<i>Now, prove yourself to me.</i>

37:51.229 --> 37:52.764
<i>I spoke to my friend.</i>

37:52.833 --> 37:55.005
<i>I can get you immunity.</i>

37:55.073 --> 37:57.077
<i>Good.</i>

38:14.012 --> 38:16.015
<i>Ellen, it's Tom.</i>

38:16.083 --> 38:18.087
<i>We're in business.</i>

38:23.429 --> 38:24.831
<i>Tom got this from</i>

38:24.899 --> 38:26.700
<i>Leonard Winstone?</i>

38:26.768 --> 38:27.768
<i>Yes.</i>

38:27.836 --> 38:29.840
<i>They made a deal.</i>

38:29.907 --> 38:31.242
<i>What kind of deal?</i>

38:31.310 --> 38:32.845
<i>Tom was the one who</i>

38:32.912 --> 38:34.013
<i>leaked to the judge that he was</i>

38:34.081 --> 38:37.151
<i>invested with the Tobins.</i>

38:37.219 --> 38:38.686
<i>He set up his own</i>

38:38.754 --> 38:39.922
<i>resignation?</i>

38:39.989 --> 38:40.823
<i>He wanted the world</i>

38:40.891 --> 38:42.126
<i>to think that he had cut ties</i>

38:42.193 --> 38:43.662
<i>with you so he could make a deal</i>

38:43.730 --> 38:45.334
<i>with Winstone.</i>

38:45.401 --> 38:47.070
<i>And it worked.</i>

38:47.138 --> 38:48.371
<i>Winstone's agreed to turn</i>

38:48.439 --> 38:50.874
<i>against the Tobins.</i>

38:50.942 --> 38:52.309
<i>Yeah, I'm staying at</i>

38:52.377 --> 38:55.213
<i>a hotel tonight.</i>

38:55.280 --> 38:57.417
<i>Don't worry about me, Megan.</i>

38:57.484 --> 38:58.786
<i>I love you, too.</i>

38:58.855 --> 39:00.858
<i>Good night.</i>

39:16.080 --> 39:17.681
<i>Did you know Tom was</i>

39:17.748 --> 39:18.782
<i>planning on approaching</i>

39:18.850 --> 39:20.416
<i>Winstone?</i>

39:20.483 --> 39:22.918
<i>Yes.</i>

39:22.985 --> 39:24.919
<i>But he was protecting you.</i>

39:24.987 --> 39:27.088
<i>If it failed, he wanted to take</i>

39:27.156 --> 39:29.156
<i>the fall alone.</i>

39:50.075 --> 39:51.308
<i>Geez, man, what are</i>

39:51.376 --> 39:52.476
<i>you doing here?</i>

39:52.544 --> 39:53.644
<i>What were you doing</i>

39:53.712 --> 39:54.912
<i>meeting with that guy from</i>

39:54.980 --> 39:56.180
<i>Thanksgiving?</i>

39:56.248 --> 39:57.415
<i>Oh, that was nothing.</i>

39:57.482 --> 39:59.117
<i>It was just, you know...</i>

39:59.185 --> 40:01.020
<i>Don't worry about that.</i>

40:01.088 --> 40:03.828
<i>It's cold out there.</i>

40:03.897 --> 40:05.466
<i>Oh, well, stay here,</i>

40:05.534 --> 40:07.438
<i>stay here.</i>

40:07.506 --> 40:10.308
<i>It's fine.</i>

40:10.376 --> 40:13.846
<i>Thanks, Tommy.</i>

40:13.914 --> 40:15.448
<i>I would think you'd</i>

40:15.515 --> 40:19.852
<i>be impressed with him, Patty.</i>
