WEBVTT

00:55.823 --> 00:57.424
Bravo! Encore!

01:00.494 --> 01:02.030
Oh hey. See you next summer?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.965
Wouldn't miss it.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.299
Awesome.

01:07.602 --> 01:08.736
Thank you.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.852
That's it, that's everyone.

01:24.886 --> 01:27.487
This summer camp
is done and done.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.958
- What times is it?
- Party time!

05:06.741 --> 05:07.775
Bye.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.347
Oh, I have something for you.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.884
Okay, don't open it until you
get to New York, though, okay?

05:17.919 --> 05:19.486
Okay.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.655
All right.

05:20.688 --> 05:25.092
I actually have
something for you.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.641
I love it, thank you.

05:40.675 --> 05:43.711
You're welcome.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.216
All right.

05:48.249 --> 05:50.051
They loved meeting you.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.418
Yeah.

05:51.451 --> 05:54.522
My parents would have
loved meeting you, too.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.792
Sage, honey,
it's time to go!

06:02.830 --> 06:05.099
When will I see you again?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.367
I, I don't know.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.670
I'll call you when I can.

06:09.704 --> 06:12.073
It was so great to meet
you, Anthony.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.373
We hope to see you soon.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.775
Have fun
in the Big Apple!

06:21.414 --> 06:25.286
<i>You're
listening to WBCN: Sports Talk!</i>

06:25.319 --> 06:29.190
<i>with Phil and Eric,
Pennsylvania's finest!</i>

06:29.223 --> 06:30.524
How you doin', Phil?

06:30.558 --> 06:31.259
Good,
how are you, Eric?

06:31.292 --> 06:32.459
I'm doing good.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.961
I just finished
a steak and cheese.

06:33.995 --> 06:35.029
What are you doin'?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.298
On the air with you now.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.866
Phil, what'd you do
last night?

06:38.900 --> 06:41.035
I watched the
Phillies, they suck.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.009
Seriously, Mr. Perry, thanks.

06:48.042 --> 06:49.442
So what do you think, Tony?

06:49.476 --> 06:50.711
Is this the year?

06:50.745 --> 06:51.846
Could be.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.181
25 years, man.

06:54.215 --> 06:55.448
Yeah.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.352
Hopefully this is the year
we'll get one.

06:58.386 --> 07:01.822
But anyway, I'll see you
in school, Daphne?

07:01.856 --> 07:04.225
Okay, bye.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.161
- All right, take it easy.
- Thanks again.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.901
Hey, Tony.

07:13.935 --> 07:17.405
I hope you're back home
safe in Manhattan.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.408
So, plant these seeds
in a special place

07:20.440 --> 07:23.077
and I'll do the same.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.347
I know that we can't be
together right now, but...

07:26.380 --> 07:30.184
it makes me smile it know
that our flowers

07:30.217 --> 07:32.386
are growing under the same sun.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.757
I will never forget this summer,

07:36.791 --> 07:39.126
and the love that we shared.

07:40.361 --> 07:41.595
Sage.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.230
Good luck
this season, Tony!

07:43.264 --> 07:44.365
Thanks, Jessica.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.999
We've got little kids
that are having

08:18.032 --> 08:20.234
deadly seizures
and cancer patients

08:20.267 --> 08:23.738
who can't get any relief
and we're the only ones

08:23.771 --> 08:25.139
that can get them this stuff.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.375
You guys are ridiculous.

08:27.408 --> 08:30.244
Honey, this is important
work we're doing here.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.446
Okay, let's not act like
we're diving down the road

08:32.480 --> 08:35.116
passing out medicine to
every cancer patient we pass.

08:35.149 --> 08:37.351
- Which reminds me.
- Hmm?

08:37.385 --> 08:38.919
I think it's time we pick
our next spot.

08:38.953 --> 08:39.987
Yes!

08:40.021 --> 08:41.756
- Oh, come on.
- Woo!

08:41.789 --> 08:43.157
No.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.593
Okay, you guys are seriously
embarrassing yourselves.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.429
Okay, all right.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.530
You know, dressing
it up doesn't make

08:49.563 --> 08:50.664
me wanna do this
any more, right?

08:50.698 --> 08:51.799
Oh come on.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.134
- Pick a good one.
- Okay.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.002
But if I get, like,
Wyoming, I'm not going.

08:55.036 --> 08:56.237
Just do it.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.277
- Yes!
- Tennessee, yee haw!

09:05.146 --> 09:07.114
- Haha, that's awesome.
- I need some new boots.

09:07.148 --> 09:08.649
- Yay.
- I hate country music.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.055
- Hello?
- In here.

09:14.088 --> 09:16.257
Kev, you home?

09:16.290 --> 09:18.092
What's up, man?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.693
- Oh, bro!
- It's good to see you.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.563
- Welcome back!
- Thank you, thank you.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.833
You should have seen me
up there, man.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.469
I was in my element, full on.

09:28.503 --> 09:30.871
Oh, it was such a dream.

09:30.905 --> 09:33.674
I got to learn from some of
the best in the country, like,

09:33.707 --> 09:35.943
Broadway dance coaches.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.445
I'm happy for you, bro.

09:39.313 --> 09:42.416
Hey, have you... have
you talked to coach?

09:42.450 --> 09:43.751
He's on his way here now.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.753
He knows you're back today.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.888
What are you
gonna tell him?

09:47.922 --> 09:49.023
What do you mean?

09:49.056 --> 09:52.126
Bro, he's gonna
find out.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.260
Hey.

09:53.294 --> 09:55.129
There he is, my star kicker.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.230
Hey.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.364
Hey, man.

09:57.398 --> 09:58.466
How was camp?

09:58.499 --> 09:59.534
Good.

09:59.568 --> 10:00.701
Great.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.136
Great, a lot of talent
down there.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.004
Good, hey, you know, that's
what those camps are for.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.706
You never wanna get
too comfortable.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.309
I ever tell you about
Matt Heely, class of '92?

10:08.342 --> 10:10.177
Kevin, you remember him?

10:10.211 --> 10:13.347
Yeah, guy had a foot
just like yours, Tony.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.448
Tony, listen.

10:14.482 --> 10:15.783
This guy was lights out.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.985
I'm talking All American,
full ride to Alabama,

10:18.018 --> 10:19.588
destined to go pro.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.822
Wound up tearing his MCL days
before the Homecoming game.

10:21.856 --> 10:23.023
Boom.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.458
Just like that,
his career was over.

10:24.492 --> 10:27.795
However, had he committed
to the camp,

10:27.828 --> 10:31.065
could've came back here with
some new fancy moves like you.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.768
Came home with some
new moves, all right.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.770
Hey, Tony?

10:36.804 --> 10:38.639
Homecoming or bust.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.213
You had a good summer, huh?

10:46.247 --> 10:48.048
I did, yeah.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.917
I realize
that you've never

10:49.950 --> 10:51.553
introduced us to a boy before.

10:51.586 --> 10:53.053
Is it serious?

10:53.087 --> 10:55.022
I can never take boys seriously.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.824
- Why?
- It's pointless to try.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.192
Why?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.828
Because the minute I do,
we just pick up and leave.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.233
Hey, um...
can I have a cell phone?

11:06.267 --> 11:07.569
You know we can't have those.

11:07.602 --> 11:10.037
Sage, you love
seeing new places

11:10.070 --> 11:11.872
and having new experiences.

11:11.906 --> 11:15.209
Yeah, I do, but like,
I just wanna try

11:15.242 --> 11:17.411
to stay in one place for once.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.213
Try what it feels like to be...

11:20.381 --> 11:21.749
I'm gonna say it.

11:21.782 --> 11:22.917
No.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.251
Honey no, don't you dare.

11:24.285 --> 11:25.920
Normal!

11:25.953 --> 11:28.022
Normalcy breeds complacency.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.659
You are an individual, my child.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.227
Go out and make your mark
on this world!

12:09.496 --> 12:12.534
Okay, but I still wanna
go to like, a real school.

12:12.567 --> 12:15.503
Have, you know,
non-adult friends.

12:15.537 --> 12:17.104
I'm tried of being stuck
in this Airstream

12:17.137 --> 12:19.173
with you... dancing weirdos.

12:55.744 --> 12:56.844
I still want to be normal.

13:00.214 --> 13:01.315
Hi.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.083
- Hi.
- Um, could I use your phone?

13:07.288 --> 13:10.291
<i>Hey it's Tony,
sorry, leave a message.</i>

13:10.324 --> 13:12.326
Hey, it's Sage.

13:12.359 --> 13:16.263
We just stopped for gas
so I thought I'd try you...

13:16.297 --> 13:19.233
We are somewhere
in Delaware, I think.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.001
We're going to
a town near Nashville.

13:25.707 --> 13:27.841
Well, I hope city life
is treating you okay.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.477
I'll call you when I can.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.558
Hi, we're here
with Tony Michaels

13:43.591 --> 13:44.825
and Dexter Sharpless,

13:44.858 --> 13:47.861
seniors and captains
of the Mount Abe Eagles.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.632
Now tonight marks the
start of a new season.

13:50.665 --> 13:52.099
How you feelin', fellas?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.568
<i>Feeling good,
I'm looking forward to it.</i>

13:53.601 --> 13:55.235
<i>What do you say, Dex?
You think we're gonna win?</i>

13:55.269 --> 13:56.470
<i>Hell yes!</i>

13:56.504 --> 13:57.871
<i>Meet Tony Michaels</i>

13:57.905 --> 13:59.306
<i>star kicker of the Eagles</i>

13:59.340 --> 14:01.743
<i>and the key to victory at
this year's Homecoming game.</i>

14:01.776 --> 14:04.579
<i>Thanks to Coach
T's "Golden Foot" offense.</i>

14:04.612 --> 14:06.347
<i>Nice job, Anderson, good job.</i>

14:06.380 --> 14:07.649
<i>All right, Tony.</i>

14:07.682 --> 14:08.783
<i>Let's see how that foot
fared this summer.</i>

14:08.817 --> 14:11.553
<i>Special teams, let's go!</i>

14:11.586 --> 14:14.388
<i>Come on, Coach,
it's only first down!</i>

14:14.421 --> 14:16.524
<i>Are they gonna finally
win the big game?</i>

14:16.558 --> 14:18.859
- <i>Their kicker is a legend!</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

14:18.892 --> 14:20.762
<i>A legend among people!</i>

14:20.795 --> 14:22.963
<i>He trains at the temple.</i>

14:22.996 --> 14:26.066
<i>All the Eagles gotta do
is get the ball to the 50...</i>

14:27.901 --> 14:31.238
<i>and it's a guaranteed
three points!</i>

14:31.271 --> 14:34.241
<i>Tony Michaels never misses.</i>

14:34.274 --> 14:37.111
<i>Which is great, because
that's all they really got!</i>

14:37.144 --> 14:41.048
<i>This team is pretty lousy.</i>

14:41.081 --> 14:42.784
<i>Hell yeah, Tony.</i>

14:42.817 --> 14:44.284
<i>What a legend, huh?</i>

14:44.318 --> 14:45.986
<i>Bite me, Greg.</i>

14:46.019 --> 14:49.524
<i>Meet Cody Humphreys,
quarterback for the Eagles.</i>

14:49.557 --> 14:51.392
<i>He's been
pretty much a benchwarmer</i>

14:51.425 --> 14:53.795
<i>since Tony took center stage.</i>

14:53.828 --> 14:55.730
<i>It's honestly very
sad when your whole team</i>

14:55.764 --> 14:57.665
<i>is dependent on your kicker.</i>

14:57.699 --> 15:00.000
<i>They never throw
the ball</i>

15:00.033 --> 15:01.736
<i>and I can see why.</i>

15:03.237 --> 15:05.439
<i>Ugh, dammit!</i>

15:05.472 --> 15:07.441
<i>This guy couldn't hit
the broadside</i>

15:07.474 --> 15:08.810
<i>of a barn if he tried.</i>

15:08.843 --> 15:10.310
<i>Is he going to the NFL?</i>

15:10.344 --> 15:11.546
<i>Why are you asking me that?</i>

15:11.579 --> 15:12.946
<i>You know the answer is no.</i>

15:14.448 --> 15:15.517
<i>Yeah, we're ready to go.</i>

15:15.550 --> 15:16.950
And I, like

15:16.984 --> 15:19.086
all of us, will certainly
be rooting for you tonight.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.320
Thanks.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.624
And, cut.

15:22.657 --> 15:24.626
Okay, we got it.
All right?

15:26.160 --> 15:27.595
25 years.

15:28.763 --> 15:30.931
Don't let us down.

15:40.441 --> 15:45.713
It's an injection problem.

15:45.747 --> 15:48.282
Yep, that's what I thought.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.150
How long's it gonna take?

15:50.184 --> 15:51.519
These are vintage parts.

15:51.553 --> 15:53.721
I mean, it's gonna take
me a while to get 'em

15:53.755 --> 15:54.823
if I can get 'em.

15:54.856 --> 15:56.089
If?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.074
So, what is our plan?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.043
We don't have many options.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.848
♪ Roll, roll, roll
your own path ♪

16:19.881 --> 16:21.850
♪ I found a rental ♪

16:21.883 --> 16:23.183
What?

16:23.217 --> 16:24.552
- Where did you get that?
- What is that?

16:24.586 --> 16:26.253
On the bulletin board
by the bathroom.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.759
Come on, you said we
can't miss a grow season.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.661
That is not the worst idea.

16:33.695 --> 16:34.729
We can't lose out on a month of

16:34.762 --> 16:36.598
grow time just sitting around.

16:36.631 --> 16:38.465
I could go to high school here.

16:38.499 --> 16:39.767
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.803
And I can take the
train to visit Anthony.

16:41.836 --> 16:44.739
Okay, we are super ahead
of ourselves.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.139
- Oh excuse me.
- Oh, hey.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.609
Do you go to high school here?

16:47.642 --> 16:48.710
Yeah.

16:48.743 --> 16:49.811
What's it like?

16:49.844 --> 16:50.912
You now, pretty typical.

16:50.945 --> 16:52.045
Yeah, I don't.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.313
Can you elaborate?

16:53.347 --> 16:55.850
Well, the football
players rule the school,

16:55.884 --> 16:58.085
cheerleaders are
the most popular,

16:58.118 --> 16:59.854
and things like that.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.823
Though, the food is pretty good

17:01.856 --> 17:04.224
and the lockers are spacious.

17:04.258 --> 17:05.793
Oh, lockers.

17:06.961 --> 17:08.830
I'm Sage, I live here now.

17:08.863 --> 17:11.699
- Hi! I'm Nancy.
- Hi!

17:11.733 --> 17:13.267
I'll see you at school,
Sage.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.602
I'll show you around.

17:14.636 --> 17:16.004
Awesome.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.305
You live here now?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.008
- Yep.
- Wow.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.108
Come on.

17:24.177 --> 17:28.883
We haven't won a Homecoming
game in 25 years.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.952
When we step out on that field,

17:30.985 --> 17:34.522
I want you to give me
everything you've got!

17:34.556 --> 17:35.924
Do you understand me?

17:35.957 --> 17:36.958
Yes, sir!

17:36.991 --> 17:38.258
I said, do you understand me?

17:38.292 --> 17:39.293
Yes, sir!

17:39.326 --> 17:40.360
Who am I?

17:40.394 --> 17:41.629
I am a champion!

17:41.663 --> 17:42.964
- Who am I?
- I am a champion!

17:42.997 --> 17:44.131
Break it down on 3!

18:08.623 --> 18:10.424
- Hey, there.
- Oh my gosh, you scared me.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.526
You made it.

18:11.559 --> 18:12.961
I made it.

18:12.994 --> 18:15.228
Well I have to keep my
promise and show you around.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.699
Oh that would be great.
This is so overwhelming.

18:17.732 --> 18:18.933
I bet.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.002
But first...

18:21.035 --> 18:22.670
here are your lockers!

18:22.704 --> 18:24.404
They're perfect.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.507
They're everything I've
always dreamed of.

18:26.541 --> 18:28.710
Well, well, well.

18:28.743 --> 18:31.045
Who do we have here?

18:31.079 --> 18:34.281
Nancy, you gonna
introduce me, or what?

18:34.314 --> 18:37.619
Cody, whatever happened
to having some class?

18:37.652 --> 18:39.988
No class needed, baby.

18:40.021 --> 18:42.523
I'm a football player.

18:42.557 --> 18:44.092
Sad, but true.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.860
Come on, Sage.

18:45.893 --> 18:47.929
Nice to meet you, Sage.

19:17.058 --> 19:22.229
Introducing this year's
Homecoming Queen!

19:22.262 --> 19:24.498
And you'll be my king.

19:24.532 --> 19:25.667
Hi, Beth.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.101
How was my summer?

19:27.135 --> 19:29.637
Oh, just sailed around the
Galapagos with the fam.

19:29.671 --> 19:31.271
Thanks for asking.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.372
- I don't remember asking...
- I spent the entire

19:32.406 --> 19:34.809
summer in my bikini.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.276
I mean, if you've got the goods,

19:36.309 --> 19:39.681
give the people what
they want, am I right?

19:39.714 --> 19:40.815
Ooh.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.784
Speaking of the goods.

19:42.817 --> 19:43.885
Wow.

19:43.918 --> 19:45.053
Guys, guys.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.954
You gotta check out
the new chick.

19:46.988 --> 19:49.189
So hot.

19:50.692 --> 19:52.727
Oh. Hi, Beth.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.361
What do you say?

19:54.394 --> 19:55.830
You and me at Homecoming?

19:55.863 --> 19:57.699
In your dreams, Cody.

19:57.732 --> 20:00.467
I'm already spoken for.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.537
Give the people what they want.

20:02.570 --> 20:03.705
Right, tiger?

20:05.940 --> 20:07.809
Hang these up around school.

20:07.842 --> 20:09.309
I love you, too.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.512
Let's get a look
at this new girl.

20:11.546 --> 20:12.613
Hi, Beth.

20:12.647 --> 20:13.948
Blow me.

20:13.981 --> 20:17.051
You know, Homecoming is
coming up soon.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.319
I have lots of friends
who are football players.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.388
I can introduce you to one
of them.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.757
Oh, that's okay.

20:22.790 --> 20:24.559
I actually sort of have
a guy in my life already.

20:24.592 --> 20:27.227
- I met him at dance camp.
- Stop!

20:30.598 --> 20:31.999
I mean, keep going.

20:32.033 --> 20:34.202
Oh.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.803
Nancy.

20:35.837 --> 20:36.938
New girl.

20:36.971 --> 20:38.039
Hi, Beth.

20:38.072 --> 20:40.440
So what's your name, new girl?

20:40.474 --> 20:42.442
Um, it's... it's Sage.

20:42.476 --> 20:44.045
She's from Vermont.

20:44.078 --> 20:46.147
People actually live in Vermont?

20:46.180 --> 20:47.982
I thought it was just cows.

20:48.015 --> 20:50.118
- Moo!
- Oh my god.

20:51.853 --> 20:53.855
You scare easy, don't you?

20:53.888 --> 20:55.489
Ignore her, Sage.

20:55.523 --> 20:57.558
It's fine.

20:57.592 --> 21:00.895
Sage was just telling
me about her boyfriend

21:00.928 --> 21:03.831
from dance camp, pretty cool!

21:03.865 --> 21:06.200
You? Have a boyfriend?

21:06.234 --> 21:07.467
I mean, not really.

21:07.502 --> 21:10.204
He lives in New York, so
it's complicated, but...

21:10.238 --> 21:12.974
we had the most magical summer.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.742
Yeah, there were a lot of babes

21:14.776 --> 21:16.010
at the pool this summer.

21:16.043 --> 21:18.212
I lost count at like...

21:18.246 --> 21:19.514
Zero.

21:19.547 --> 21:21.682
Ha! Yeah.

21:21.716 --> 21:24.185
Whatever!

21:24.218 --> 21:25.520
Alec, how's it going?

21:25.553 --> 21:28.156
Hey Tony, you got
a girlfriend?

21:28.189 --> 21:32.126
I did meet a girl
this summer and, guys,

21:32.160 --> 21:33.426
she's pretty awesome.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.296
I played music and he danced,
it was cute.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.033
But he goes to a fancy dance
academy on the Upper West Side.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.768
Oh my gosh.

21:40.802 --> 21:43.104
Wow, he sounds unbelievable.

21:43.137 --> 21:45.372
Yeah, as in not believable.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.874
Show us a picture.

21:46.908 --> 21:48.543
Oh I would, but
I don't have a phone.

21:48.576 --> 21:49.577
Oh.

21:49.610 --> 21:51.045
Who doesn't have a phone?

21:51.078 --> 21:52.613
Shut up, Beth.

21:52.647 --> 21:54.715
Tell us how it all went down.

21:54.749 --> 21:55.883
Yeah.

25:12.780 --> 25:14.782
Bravo, bravo.

25:14.815 --> 25:17.351
Super sappy love stor...

25:19.120 --> 25:21.689
Did you say his name was
Anthony?

25:21.722 --> 25:23.324
Yeah.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.092
And you met him at dance camp?

25:25.126 --> 25:26.360
Yeah.

25:29.230 --> 25:32.700
Oh, my, goddess.

25:32.733 --> 25:35.002
I call bullshit, dude.

25:35.036 --> 25:38.439
"Oh, yeah, I've got a
girlfriend, she's super hot.

25:38.472 --> 25:41.575
Oh, no, I don't know
if I'll see her again."

25:41.609 --> 25:43.811
No, she's very real.

25:43.844 --> 25:44.945
Check it out.

25:48.349 --> 25:49.683
So.

25:49.717 --> 25:53.654
You're saying she could be
anywhere right now, huh?

25:53.687 --> 25:54.922
Uh, yeah?

25:54.955 --> 25:56.891
Technically.

25:56.924 --> 25:58.759
Hall pass, please.

25:58.793 --> 26:00.728
- Ugh!
- Ow!

26:00.761 --> 26:02.096
Watch it, Cody!

26:02.129 --> 26:03.497
Sorry.

26:03.532 --> 26:06.700
But, Beth, you won't believe
what I just found out.

26:06.734 --> 26:09.236
I've got gossip...
with a capital G.

26:09.270 --> 26:10.604
Spill it.

26:10.638 --> 26:13.441
Tony and the new chick,
they know each other.

26:13.474 --> 26:15.810
I knew that was his necklace!

26:15.843 --> 26:18.712
That means Tony and
Sage met at dance camp.

26:18.746 --> 26:19.847
- Yes!
- Oh.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.015
Wait, what?

26:21.048 --> 26:24.952
Thank you, Lordess
of Eternal Death!

26:24.985 --> 26:26.253
Dance camp...

26:26.287 --> 26:27.688
we gotta tell everyone.

26:27.721 --> 26:29.223
I'm gonna be star quarterback,
I'm gonna be star quar...

26:29.256 --> 26:30.291
- Hey!
- Whoa!

26:30.324 --> 26:31.892
Not so fast...

26:31.926 --> 26:34.495
we need to make a plan.

27:04.225 --> 27:07.027
When you say "dance camp,"
do you mean...

27:08.496 --> 27:10.197
Yes, twinkle toes.

27:10.231 --> 27:11.699
Tony went to dance camp.

27:11.732 --> 27:13.667
I wonder what Coach
would think about that.

27:33.287 --> 27:34.655
First of all, we're not a team.

27:34.688 --> 27:36.657
You can be my... assistant.

27:36.690 --> 27:37.691
Final offer.

27:37.725 --> 27:39.293
Only offer, but I'll take it.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.661
Tell me what to do, queen.

28:00.381 --> 28:02.349
Hey! Come to the pep rally!

28:11.926 --> 28:13.227
Listen.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.663
Nancy took a terrible
spill and she's dead.

28:14.695 --> 28:15.729
- What?
- Ugh, okay.

28:15.763 --> 28:16.764
She's not dead.

28:16.797 --> 28:17.932
She broke her arm though.

28:17.965 --> 28:19.800
There's blood everywhere,
it's disgusting.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.135
It's not important, though.

28:21.168 --> 28:22.537
What's important is that
we need to find someone

28:22.571 --> 28:23.804
to fill in for her
at the pep rally,

28:23.837 --> 28:25.640
- and that someone is you!
- Me?

28:25.674 --> 28:26.774
- I...
- You'll do it, right

28:26.807 --> 28:28.342
The whole school is
counting on you.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.579
In memory of Nancy?

28:30.612 --> 28:32.012
- Yeah, I mean...
- Great.

28:32.046 --> 28:34.248
Okay, your skirts and shirts and

28:34.281 --> 28:36.150
all the things that you need.

28:36.183 --> 28:38.752
You're on the squad!
See you at the gym at 3.

28:38.786 --> 28:40.254
Rest in peace, Nancy!

28:45.059 --> 28:46.193
Hey, Tony.

28:46.227 --> 28:47.596
Coach wants to see you.

28:47.629 --> 28:49.096
Now.

28:51.832 --> 28:52.933
Gotcha.

29:49.823 --> 29:51.191
Ugh, you're a lifesaver.

29:51.225 --> 29:52.826
Thank you so much
for coming out.

29:52.860 --> 29:54.596
Happy you're on the squad.

29:54.629 --> 29:59.734
Let's give it up
for our Mount Abe Poms!

30:01.068 --> 30:03.203
Eagles, ready?

30:03.237 --> 30:04.706
Okay.

30:04.739 --> 30:06.940
<i>♪ Eagles, time to soar ♪</i>

30:06.974 --> 30:09.209
<i>♪ Come on, fans,

30:17.117 --> 30:19.554
fly like an eagle...

30:26.260 --> 30:27.828
Mooooooooooo!

31:02.062 --> 31:03.197
Sage! Wait!

31:03.230 --> 31:06.467
Sage, hold on,
hold on, wait.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.168
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

31:08.202 --> 31:09.269
What am I doing here?

31:09.303 --> 31:10.938
What are you doing here?

31:12.973 --> 31:14.542
Do you live here?

31:15.943 --> 31:17.911
Anthony.

31:17.945 --> 31:20.414
Meet me in the library
right after this, okay?

31:20.447 --> 31:22.349
I'll explain everything,
Sage, please.

31:45.906 --> 31:47.040
Jesus.

31:48.710 --> 31:49.844
Nope.

31:49.878 --> 31:51.011
Just me.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.617
What the hell, Beth?
Why'd you have my phone?

31:55.650 --> 31:58.218
Nice tights, sugar.

31:59.888 --> 32:01.021
Okay, what do you want?

32:01.054 --> 32:02.256
Seriously?

32:02.289 --> 32:04.626
Must I spell it out for you?

32:04.659 --> 32:06.193
The crown.

32:06.226 --> 32:09.664
I want the goddamn crown, and
you're gonna help me get it.

32:12.099 --> 32:15.837
Because the star kicker, and
the cheerleading captain,

32:15.870 --> 32:19.072
are what I like to call
high school royalty.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.073
Yeah?

32:20.107 --> 32:23.010
And what if I say no?

32:23.043 --> 32:25.713
Then I'll put these photos
on blast

32:25.747 --> 32:28.683
faster than you can say...

32:28.716 --> 32:31.118

32:42.463 --> 32:44.298
I don't even know you.

32:44.331 --> 32:46.534
Sage, you know me better
than anyone else in the world.

32:46.568 --> 32:49.303
No, I'm looking at a
stranger in a football jersey.

32:49.336 --> 32:51.205
Okay, you're right.

32:51.238 --> 32:53.575
I faked my resume to Lakeview.

32:53.608 --> 32:55.777
I've never studied in New York.

32:55.810 --> 32:58.245
But I had to keep up the lie
to get through the summer.

32:58.278 --> 33:00.380
Why would you lie to me
about it?

33:00.414 --> 33:02.182
I wouldn't have told anyone.

33:02.216 --> 33:03.283
I know.

33:03.317 --> 33:04.351
I wish I hadn't.

33:04.384 --> 33:05.653
Now that you got caught.

33:05.687 --> 33:06.821
Sage.

33:06.855 --> 33:08.523
You already liked
that version of me.

33:08.556 --> 33:09.990
Fancy dancer with a scholarship,

33:10.023 --> 33:11.526
not some small town jock.

33:11.559 --> 33:14.061
You do not get to
decide my feelings for me.

33:14.094 --> 33:15.697
You don't know that.

33:15.730 --> 33:17.064
Okay, no, you're right.

33:17.097 --> 33:19.734
Let's try it, right now.
Hi, I'm Tony Michaels.

33:19.767 --> 33:22.436
I love dancing, but I'm
so terrified to talk

33:22.469 --> 33:24.906
to anybody about it,
that I do it privately

33:24.939 --> 33:26.774
in the tool shed in my backyard.

33:26.808 --> 33:30.143
I come from a town where
everyone is so obsessed

33:30.177 --> 33:32.446
with breaking this
25 year football curse,

33:32.479 --> 33:34.916
and apparently I'm
the only guy to do it.

33:36.483 --> 33:38.185
<i>Do we have a Tony Michaels</i>

33:38.218 --> 33:39.921
<i>in the building?</i>

33:39.954 --> 33:43.691
<i>The local news wants to
interview you before practice.</i>

33:43.725 --> 33:45.459
<i>Go, Eagles!</i>

33:45.492 --> 33:46.628
Well, you better get
to practice.

33:46.661 --> 33:48.563
You don't wanna let
everyone down.

33:48.596 --> 33:50.197
You know what, do me a favor.

33:50.230 --> 33:51.431
When you see me in the hallway,

33:51.465 --> 33:53.333
just keep pretending
you don't know me.

33:53.367 --> 33:55.003
You're pretty good
at pretending.

36:20.748 --> 36:21.783
Honey.

36:21.816 --> 36:22.850
Wake up.

36:22.884 --> 36:24.351
I'm not going.

36:24.384 --> 36:26.219
You're gonna miss school?

36:26.253 --> 36:27.755
I hate it there.

36:27.789 --> 36:29.857
I thought that's
what you wanted.

36:29.891 --> 36:32.927
Yeah, me too, but I was wrong.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.295
I liked being homeschooled,
let's do that again.

36:35.328 --> 36:37.464
Darling, what happened?

36:37.497 --> 36:38.666
Nothing.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.868
Come on.

36:40.902 --> 36:42.369
I just can't.

36:42.402 --> 36:47.008
You are a smart, talented,
powerhouse of a young lady.

36:47.041 --> 36:48.976
And I know you can accomplish
absolutely

36:49.010 --> 36:51.344
anything you put your mind to.

36:51.378 --> 36:54.582
You can certainly get through
another day of high school.

36:54.615 --> 36:55.817
Come on.

36:55.850 --> 36:57.585
- I have a fever.
- No, you don't.

37:13.601 --> 37:15.536
Did I ever tell you
that my dad

37:15.570 --> 37:17.805
and Coach were best friends?

37:21.175 --> 37:22.877
Right.

37:22.910 --> 37:25.613
Coach was kind of like an
uncle to my brother and me, so,

37:25.646 --> 37:27.347
you know, when my parents d...

37:29.784 --> 37:32.419
Anyways.

37:32.452 --> 37:35.288
Coach kind of stepped in
and helped support us,

37:35.322 --> 37:38.192
and it's not that I don't
like playing football,

37:38.226 --> 37:39.961
that's not it.

37:39.994 --> 37:42.997
It's just not the only
thing I'm passionate about.

37:43.030 --> 37:45.566
And I feel like I woke up
one day

37:45.600 --> 37:49.604
and I was this football star
and that's all I ever do,

37:49.637 --> 37:51.672
and that's never really
what I wanted.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.842
Well why don't you just
tell him?

37:54.876 --> 37:55.910
Tell him what?

37:55.943 --> 37:58.980
How you feel. What you want.

37:59.013 --> 38:01.582
I'm scared, I guess.

38:02.850 --> 38:04.786
That wasn't so hard, was it?

38:04.819 --> 38:06.319
What?

38:06.353 --> 38:07.889
Being honest.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.995
Now that we're being
completely honest,

38:14.028 --> 38:17.899
I wasn't totally straight
with you either.

38:33.413 --> 38:36.517
Oh my god.

38:36.551 --> 38:40.320
Well, I know your
secret and now you know mine.

38:40.353 --> 38:43.191
Your moms are... drug dealers?

38:43.224 --> 38:45.693
Well, I mean they prefer
cannabis cultivators,

38:45.726 --> 38:49.030
or revolutionaries,
either will work.

38:49.063 --> 38:50.598
Welcome to my life.

38:50.631 --> 38:53.267
There's the whole picture of
why we're always on the move.

38:53.301 --> 38:56.137
Can't stay in one place
longer than a growing season.

38:56.170 --> 38:58.973
Always trying to stay one
step ahead of the law.

39:00.575 --> 39:02.610
All right, there's one more
thing I have to show you.

39:08.049 --> 39:09.183
Wow.

39:09.217 --> 39:10.718
They're beautiful.

39:10.751 --> 39:13.287
Thanks.

39:13.321 --> 39:15.523
Sage, can we start over?

39:22.296 --> 39:23.531
All right.

39:23.564 --> 39:26.200
Meet me here everyday
after practice.

39:26.234 --> 39:29.203
You say you wanna dance,
you're gonna prove it.

39:31.505 --> 39:33.641
Unless you're happy just
kicking the pig ball

39:33.674 --> 39:35.142
around for two hours.

39:35.176 --> 39:37.144
- Pig skin.
- Mhm, whatever.

39:38.512 --> 39:40.615
Okay, everyday.

39:40.648 --> 39:42.083
No questions asked?

39:43.584 --> 39:44.886
No questions asked.

39:48.122 --> 39:49.690
<i>All right, Phil, less</i>

39:49.724 --> 39:50.958
<i>than a week 'till Homecoming.</i>

39:50.992 --> 39:52.593
<i>How are we feeling about that?</i>

39:52.627 --> 39:54.262
<i>Nervous as hell.</i>

39:54.295 --> 39:55.563
<i>Same here.</i>

39:55.596 --> 39:58.232
<i>But rest assured, Tony Michaels
is focused</i>

39:58.266 --> 39:59.367
<i>and ready to go.</i>

41:41.602 --> 41:44.438
There's something
off about this new girl.

41:44.472 --> 41:46.073
- Yeah!
- Shut up.

41:46.107 --> 41:47.641
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

41:47.675 --> 41:49.043
Right.

41:49.076 --> 41:50.778
Don't just blindly go
along with whatever I say.

41:50.811 --> 41:51.946
It's really annoying.

41:51.979 --> 41:53.381
Sorry.

41:53.414 --> 41:54.715
Think about it.

41:54.749 --> 41:57.518
She's got no phone,
no social media,

41:57.551 --> 42:00.054
can't find her address anywhere.

42:00.087 --> 42:02.757
She's getting way
too close to Tony.

42:02.790 --> 42:05.159
What are you thinking?

42:05.192 --> 42:07.928
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

42:07.962 --> 42:12.233
Now's the time to blindly go
along with what I'm saying.

42:16.837 --> 42:19.473
Wherefore art thou?

43:22.403 --> 43:24.338
Ow!

43:46.561 --> 43:49.130
Holy Scheisse.

44:06.881 --> 44:09.817
Now you guys basically
have two jobs.

44:09.850 --> 44:12.486
That's to keep the score
low and protect Tony.

44:12.521 --> 44:15.356
So, Greg, I'm depending
on you and Sam.

44:15.389 --> 44:17.725
You guys need to help me
out here.

44:17.758 --> 44:18.926
What's up, Mattie?

44:18.959 --> 44:20.261
How about Cody?

44:20.294 --> 44:22.129
Yeah, Coach, who's gonna
protect me

44:22.163 --> 44:23.931
on the offensive line?

44:23.964 --> 44:25.299
Hey, Cody, just don't
fumble the ball

44:25.332 --> 44:27.001
and cause a safety, okay?

44:27.034 --> 44:30.771
And by all means,
do not throw the ball.

44:30.804 --> 44:32.373
All right, guys, look.

44:32.406 --> 44:34.175
We all know what's at stake.

44:34.208 --> 44:37.912
That's why we wanna make sure
that we're paying attention,

44:37.945 --> 44:42.517
and definitely not looking
at videos of our girlfriend.

44:44.919 --> 44:45.953
Aww.

44:45.986 --> 44:48.557
How precious, Tony.

44:48.590 --> 44:49.790
I'll hold onto this.

44:51.091 --> 44:52.359
Hey.

44:52.393 --> 44:53.494
Loverboy.

44:53.528 --> 44:54.695
You didn't have to do that.

44:54.728 --> 44:55.896
Oh yeah, do what?

44:55.930 --> 44:57.331
Embarrass me like that.

44:57.364 --> 44:59.967
Trust me, I could've done
a whole lot worse than that.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.302
What's going on with you?

45:01.335 --> 45:02.537
What are you talking about?

45:02.571 --> 45:04.004
I mean clearly you're
somewhere else.

45:04.038 --> 45:05.005
You're not here.

45:05.039 --> 45:06.373
Look, I get it.

45:06.407 --> 45:07.875
Your dad and I used to
chase girls around here

45:07.908 --> 45:09.143
just the same until he met
your mom...

45:09.176 --> 45:10.911
Listen, I've heard those
stories a million times.

45:10.945 --> 45:12.746
Well then why don't you
hear this?

45:12.780 --> 45:14.782
This is your senior year,
make or break.

45:14.815 --> 45:15.916
So I need you focused.

45:15.950 --> 45:17.484
And if you wanna play D1 ball...

45:17.519 --> 45:19.887
- I'm fine.
- Son, fine doesn't get it.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.223
Fine doesn't win Homecoming
games and

45:22.256 --> 45:23.457
fine doesn't get scholarships.

45:23.490 --> 45:24.593
I get it.

45:24.626 --> 45:26.528
- Do you?
- Yes.

45:26.561 --> 45:30.599
Listen, at home,
I'm you're friend,

45:30.632 --> 45:32.099
and we can talk about
whatever it is

45:32.132 --> 45:33.901
that you wanna talk about.

45:33.934 --> 45:36.470
But out here on this
field, I am your coach.

45:36.504 --> 45:38.172
I said I get it, all right?

45:38.205 --> 45:40.174
- Homecoming.
- Go Eagles!

45:40.207 --> 45:41.442
Woo!

45:44.211 --> 45:45.980
I got a meeting.

45:46.013 --> 45:47.682
I'll see you at practice.

45:49.450 --> 45:50.918
We can't lose
with this strategy.

45:50.951 --> 45:52.253
It's brilliant.

45:52.286 --> 45:53.854
All we have to is get
the ball over the 50.

45:53.887 --> 45:55.523
It's a guaranteed three points.

45:55.557 --> 45:58.025
The kid never misses.

45:58.058 --> 46:00.127
Puts as lot of pressure on Tony.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.462
What if he gets hurt?

46:03.030 --> 46:04.031
Tony.

46:04.064 --> 46:05.266
Where you going?

46:05.299 --> 46:06.433
Out.

46:06.467 --> 46:08.435
Listen, I was cooking,
and I was hoping

46:08.469 --> 46:10.871
that we could finish that
conversation from earlier today?

46:10.904 --> 46:12.707
Maybe later.
I gotta go.

46:12.741 --> 46:14.208
Listen, uh, hey...

46:19.980 --> 46:22.016
What's going on with Tony?

46:22.049 --> 46:23.350
What do you mean?

46:26.420 --> 46:28.055
He's definitely not himself.

46:33.060 --> 46:34.495
He say anything to you?

46:34.529 --> 46:37.331
Just being a moody teenager,
acting out.

46:37.364 --> 46:38.999
Hm...

46:42.469 --> 46:43.672
Maybe.

46:51.145 --> 46:53.947
Something's been on my mind.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.517
What's up?

46:55.550 --> 46:59.219
Well, what happens
when the harvest is done?

46:59.253 --> 47:00.487
Ugh.

47:00.522 --> 47:02.524
I don't wanna think about that.

47:03.957 --> 47:07.027
It usually means we skip town.

47:07.061 --> 47:10.030
So there's no way
you'll stay?

47:10.064 --> 47:11.465
We never do.

47:13.367 --> 47:15.969
Wait, you know what?
I have an idea.

47:16.003 --> 47:18.038
How about we just go
off somewhere together?

47:18.072 --> 47:20.441
We can be like Bonnie and Clyde!

47:21.975 --> 47:23.645
Wait, don't they die?

47:23.678 --> 47:25.479
Yeah, they do.

47:25.513 --> 47:27.816
Yeah... good point.

47:31.418 --> 47:33.354
It'd still be worth it.

47:45.999 --> 47:48.035
Beth?
What is this?

47:48.068 --> 47:51.639
Oh, if isn't Mister
Fancy Dancy Pants himself.

47:53.140 --> 47:54.875
It's not bad, right?

47:54.908 --> 47:57.211
I had some nerd in
homeroom make them for us.

47:57.244 --> 47:59.514
Freakin' spineless.

47:59.547 --> 48:00.914
All right, listen.

48:00.948 --> 48:04.084
I am not going to
Homecoming with you, okay?

48:04.118 --> 48:05.886
So you can post the pictures
if you want.

48:05.919 --> 48:07.388
I really don't care anymore.

48:07.421 --> 48:08.556
You mean...

48:08.590 --> 48:11.693
these pictures?

48:11.726 --> 48:13.260
Yeah.

48:13.293 --> 48:14.796
It's gonna be hard deciding
which ones

48:14.829 --> 48:18.065
to post first if you
fail me, Tony.

48:18.098 --> 48:20.835
The ones of you doing your
best Patrick Swayze impression,

48:20.869 --> 48:23.036
or the ones of all these drugs!

48:23.070 --> 48:24.506
Shh! Are you serious?

48:24.539 --> 48:25.740
Be quiet!

48:25.774 --> 48:26.841
Beth, where did you get
those photos?

48:26.875 --> 48:27.975
This is not funny.

48:28.008 --> 48:29.309
Oh you're right.

48:29.343 --> 48:30.678
It's not.

48:30.712 --> 48:32.847
It's insurance.

48:32.881 --> 48:35.784
Now get out there and
win that big game, tiger.

48:35.817 --> 48:37.985
And then take me to Homecoming.

48:38.018 --> 48:40.320
This isn't that hard.

48:40.354 --> 48:42.189
It's like I told you,

48:42.222 --> 48:45.993
this is our destiny.

48:48.095 --> 48:49.930
Here comes
Little Miss Vermont now.

48:49.963 --> 48:53.400
I'll be over there watching
the fireworks.

48:53.434 --> 48:55.436
This girl is obsessed with you.

48:55.469 --> 48:56.838
Have you seen this?

48:56.871 --> 48:58.238
Uh, yeah.

48:58.272 --> 48:59.641
Sage, I need to talk to you.

48:59.674 --> 49:01.008
Okay, what's up?

49:03.110 --> 49:06.380
It's just that... this
has to happen.

49:06.413 --> 49:08.315
I have to go.

49:08.348 --> 49:11.185
I can't tell if you're kidding.

49:11.218 --> 49:12.887
I wish I were.
It's not what you think...

49:12.921 --> 49:15.456
After she humiliated me in
front of the whole school,

49:15.489 --> 49:17.792
you're still going to
Homecoming with her?

49:17.826 --> 49:19.561
- I just...
- You know what,

49:19.594 --> 49:20.895
it doesn't matter.

49:20.929 --> 49:23.665
We're gonna be leaving
soon, so it's inevitable.

49:25.667 --> 49:27.902
Oh, hi, Paige.

49:29.269 --> 49:32.072
Vote for us.

49:37.411 --> 49:39.446
<i>25 years, Tony.</i>

49:39.480 --> 49:42.149
<i>Twenty. Five. Years, man.</i>

49:42.182 --> 49:45.052
Oh, question for you.

49:45.085 --> 49:46.788
Where were you this summer?

49:50.525 --> 49:52.192
Lakeview?

49:53.661 --> 49:55.062
<i>It's like I told you...</i>

49:55.095 --> 49:56.463
<i>Son, "fine"</i>

49:56.497 --> 49:57.966
<i>doesn't cut it.</i>

49:57.998 --> 50:00.133
A dance camp?

50:00.167 --> 50:01.636
Dance camp, Tony?

50:01.669 --> 50:03.237
I mean, come on, am I
missing something here?

50:03.270 --> 50:04.706
'Cause if I am, help me out.

50:04.739 --> 50:06.574
You went through my stuff?

50:06.608 --> 50:08.442
What the hell, Tony? Kick it!

50:10.912 --> 50:13.548
You are in for a rude awakening.

50:13.581 --> 50:15.617
So forgive me, Tony,
for trying to set

50:15.650 --> 50:17.719
you up with a successful future.

50:17.752 --> 50:21.121
No, no. Your successful
future, Coach.

50:23.123 --> 50:24.659
<i>After she humiliated me</i>

50:24.692 --> 50:26.761
<i>in front of the whole school,
you're still gonna go</i>

50:26.794 --> 50:27.829
to Homecoming with her?

50:27.862 --> 50:28.963
<i>You are such a liar.</i>

50:28.997 --> 50:30.565
Let me ask you something

50:30.598 --> 50:34.002
Have you ever once thought
about what I might want?

50:34.034 --> 50:35.637
Not one time.

50:38.038 --> 50:40.407
Homecoming or
bust though, right?

50:40.440 --> 50:41.843
Tony.

50:41.876 --> 50:43.011
Tony!

50:44.177 --> 50:45.547
What the heck, man?

50:45.580 --> 50:48.583
Stop being a baby and get
back on the line, dude!

50:48.616 --> 50:50.618
What! What!

50:50.652 --> 50:52.820
Yes!

51:10.605 --> 51:13.173
Tony!

54:51.692 --> 54:53.694
<i>Tonight is the night!</i>

54:53.728 --> 54:56.564
<i>The Eagles square off
against the Carver Otters</i>

54:56.597 --> 54:59.267
<i>for the annual Homecoming game.</i>

54:59.299 --> 55:03.137
<i>It's been a 25 year
drought for the Eagles.</i>

55:03.171 --> 55:06.073
<i>I don't think this town
can stomach another loss,</i>

55:06.107 --> 55:07.875
<i>but we'll find out tonight.</i>

55:09.309 --> 55:11.078
- Charlie.
- Here.

55:11.112 --> 55:13.080
Tony.

55:15.683 --> 55:20.087
What? Tony's not even here.

55:20.121 --> 55:22.023
Tony's not here.

55:22.056 --> 55:23.291
Yeah, I'm aware.

55:33.768 --> 55:35.002
Coach!

55:35.036 --> 55:36.469
Donna. What's up?

55:36.504 --> 55:38.573
Tony isn't in school today.

55:38.606 --> 55:40.141
What?

55:40.174 --> 55:42.977
Yes, thank you, officer.

55:43.010 --> 55:45.378
It's just so scary having
drug dealers

55:45.412 --> 55:47.682
in our peaceful community.

55:49.584 --> 55:50.618
Oh.

55:50.651 --> 55:52.553
Hi, grass fed.

55:52.587 --> 55:54.789
I was just chatting
with Officer Gorinsky.

55:54.822 --> 55:58.059
Apparently there's an
illegal drug ring going down.

55:58.092 --> 55:59.894
What are you talking about?

55:59.927 --> 56:01.996
Where is he?

56:02.029 --> 56:03.097
I don't know.

56:03.130 --> 56:04.232
Find him!

56:07.735 --> 56:10.137
It's going to be
so much fun

56:10.171 --> 56:13.574
watching you get hauled away.

56:20.380 --> 56:22.583
No!

56:29.290 --> 56:31.125
Kevin, where's Tony?

56:31.158 --> 56:32.260
School, I assume?

56:32.293 --> 56:33.561
No, he's not.

56:33.594 --> 56:35.363
Listen, you better be
honest with me.

56:35.395 --> 56:37.698
Did you know about dance camp?

56:37.732 --> 56:39.066
Yeah, I did.

56:40.167 --> 56:41.369
I mean, come on, Kevin.

56:41.401 --> 56:42.670
How could you not tell me?

56:42.703 --> 56:44.404
And why the hell would
he skip kicking camp

56:44.437 --> 56:46.974
to go to a dance camp?
I mean, help me out here.

56:47.008 --> 56:49.343
It shouldn't surprise
you that much.

56:49.377 --> 56:50.912
What are you talking about?

56:50.945 --> 56:54.916
I think there's a tape
you should see.

57:18.973 --> 57:20.641
<i>There's
Tony and his friends.</i>

57:20.675 --> 57:21.876
<i>How are we, guys?</i>

57:21.909 --> 57:24.545
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

57:24.578 --> 57:26.080
<i>Say happy birthday to your mom.</i>

57:26.113 --> 57:27.715
<i>Happy birthday,
Mom.</i>

57:27.748 --> 57:29.784
What is this?

57:33.721 --> 57:35.289
<i>Happy birthday, love.</i>

57:35.323 --> 57:36.456
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:37.858 --> 57:39.894
- <i>Nice to see you guys.</i>
- <i>Nice to see you!</i>

57:52.807 --> 57:54.608
Afternoon, ma'am.

57:54.642 --> 57:56.010
You live here?

57:58.779 --> 58:00.748
We got an anonymous tip
that there

58:00.781 --> 58:05.786
was some illegal cannabis
farming going on around here.

58:05.820 --> 58:09.056
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would ya?

58:09.090 --> 58:10.791
No.

58:10.825 --> 58:14.729
Well, we get enough
calls from high school kids

58:14.762 --> 58:17.999
that we don't pay that much
mind, but...

58:18.032 --> 58:20.735
turns out we pulled the address,

58:20.768 --> 58:23.104
and you're pulling
enough juice to

58:23.137 --> 58:25.239
light up the Homecoming game.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.975
Which is, uh...

58:31.379 --> 58:33.180
Curious.

58:36.250 --> 58:37.785
You mind if I have
a look around?

58:37.818 --> 58:39.954
I don't know, my moms
should be home soon.

58:39.987 --> 58:41.355
Oh, this won't take long...

59:05.012 --> 59:07.148
Oh, no, no, no.

59:07.181 --> 59:08.282
Sir, sir! Wait!

59:11.352 --> 59:13.120
- Wait a minute!
- Sir!

59:13.154 --> 59:14.789
- Wait, wait.
- Hey!

59:14.822 --> 59:17.058
- Hang on!
- Stop, please.

59:17.091 --> 59:18.459
Wait!

59:27.668 --> 59:29.203
False alarm.

59:29.236 --> 59:30.738
Another prank.

59:30.771 --> 59:33.607
Goddamn kids.

1:00:17.718 --> 1:00:20.387
<i>Are we gonna turn you, too?</i>

1:00:20.421 --> 1:00:21.655
<i>Your turn.</i>

1:00:23.457 --> 1:00:25.192
<i>One more time.</i>

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:51.385
<i>And as the Eagles
take the field,</i>

1:00:51.418 --> 1:00:53.654
<i>the crowd has got to be
wondering</i>

1:00:53.687 --> 1:00:56.657
<i>where the hell is Tony Michaels</i>

1:00:56.690 --> 1:00:59.326
<i>With the all star kicker
nowhere to be found,</i>

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:01.729
<i>you can only imagine what's
going through</i>

1:01:01.762 --> 1:01:03.697
<i>the Coach's mind right now.</i>

1:01:08.969 --> 1:01:12.106
She really loves
that boy.

1:01:12.139 --> 1:01:13.841
She's just a kid.

1:01:23.585 --> 1:01:27.254
<i>You cannot rely on
no offense, no defense,</i>

1:01:27.288 --> 1:01:28.989
<i>and just your kicker.</i>

1:01:29.023 --> 1:01:30.157
<i>You're just relying
on your kicker.</i>

1:01:30.191 --> 1:01:31.926
<i>Did he miss the bus?</i>

1:01:31.959 --> 1:01:33.160
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:01:33.194 --> 1:01:35.863
<i>Snap back
to the Eagles... no...</i>

1:01:35.896 --> 1:01:39.166
<i>- Oh no, oh no.</i>
<i>- No. Please.</i>

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.001
<i>Can this get any worse?</i>

1:01:43.070 --> 1:01:46.340
<i>And the quarterback sucks...
yep... once again.</i>

1:01:48.475 --> 1:01:49.910
Dammit!

1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:52.913
Damn you!

1:01:52.947 --> 1:01:54.448
Damn you all!

1:01:54.481 --> 1:01:57.117
<i>Humphreys is now
yelling at the crowd.</i>

1:01:57.151 --> 1:02:00.754
<i>Oh is he yelling
at the crowd?</i>

1:02:04.559 --> 1:02:06.393
Anthony!

1:02:11.432 --> 1:02:12.466
Sage?

1:02:12.499 --> 1:02:14.401
- Anthony!
- Sage!

1:02:15.637 --> 1:02:17.204
Hi!

1:02:20.341 --> 1:02:22.544
How did you know?

1:02:22.577 --> 1:02:25.746
Gotta stay one step
ahead of Johnny Law, right?

1:02:27.881 --> 1:02:29.483
Wait, Anthony, you're
missing the game.

1:02:30.985 --> 1:02:32.987
It doesn't matter, I'm done.

1:02:33.020 --> 1:02:34.623
I'm not gonna play.

1:02:34.656 --> 1:02:35.789
You have to play.

1:02:35.823 --> 1:02:37.424
You've worked too hard
to quit now.

1:02:37.458 --> 1:02:38.892
<i>It's the
start of the fourth quarter...</i>

1:02:38.926 --> 1:02:39.994
See?

1:02:40.027 --> 1:02:41.795
The game's almost over anyways.

1:02:41.829 --> 1:02:44.231
All right, well then all the
more reason to hustle.

1:02:44.265 --> 1:02:46.534
Now you're sounding
like Coach.

1:02:46.568 --> 1:02:49.236
Well then huddle up,
'cause I got a plan.

1:02:49.270 --> 1:02:50.505
What?

1:02:50.538 --> 1:02:52.439
Wait, what do you mean?

1:02:52.473 --> 1:02:55.442
Well, what do you think
we've been working towards?

1:03:12.826 --> 1:03:13.994
<i>Honestly, Phil?</i>

1:03:14.028 --> 1:03:16.797
<i>It's a miracle it's still
zero-zero.</i>

1:03:16.830 --> 1:03:18.232
<i>But wait a second!</i>

1:03:18.265 --> 1:03:20.934
<i>The ball is into the back
of the end zone for a safety!</i>

1:03:20.968 --> 1:03:22.336
<i>Son of a!</i>

1:03:22.369 --> 1:03:23.738
- <i>Carver leads two-nothin'.</i>
- <i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

1:03:29.209 --> 1:03:30.311
All right, do you have
everything you need?

1:03:30.344 --> 1:03:31.713
I do.

1:03:31.746 --> 1:03:32.880
- I'll see you on the field.
- I'll see you soon.

1:03:32.913 --> 1:03:34.048
You're gonna do great!

1:03:41.255 --> 1:03:44.158
<i>You broke my phone,
you monster!</i>

1:03:47.161 --> 1:03:48.862
Here we go.

1:03:48.896 --> 1:03:50.732
And then I had to
fish it out of the toilet

1:03:50.765 --> 1:03:52.232
with my bare hands.

1:03:52.266 --> 1:03:53.834
You!

1:03:53.867 --> 1:03:57.639
Ever since you showed up,
Tony hasn't even looked at me.

1:03:57.672 --> 1:04:00.274
And I look incredible

1:04:00.307 --> 1:04:04.044
every damn day.

1:04:04.078 --> 1:04:06.781
I don't know what kind
of spell you cast on him,

1:04:06.815 --> 1:04:09.983
but I'm not about to
let some trashy transfer

1:04:10.017 --> 1:04:12.386
stop me from getting my crown
and my man!

1:04:14.288 --> 1:04:20.528
'Cause you know, some things
are... meant to be.

1:04:20.562 --> 1:04:23.197
It's called destiny,
ever heard of it?

1:04:23.230 --> 1:04:27.669
And you, well, you're
destined to be locked up.

1:04:27.702 --> 1:04:30.871
Good luck getting to the
game tonight, new girl.

1:04:36.678 --> 1:04:39.913
Ahhhhh!

1:04:41.014 --> 1:04:42.449
Hi, Sage!

1:04:45.953 --> 1:04:48.255
My perfect face.

1:04:48.288 --> 1:04:50.625
Let's get the hell out of here!

1:04:52.660 --> 1:04:54.228
<i>And as the clock
ticks down</i>

1:04:54.261 --> 1:04:55.764
<i>on another Homecoming game,</i>

1:04:55.797 --> 1:04:58.700
<i>it's not looking good
for the Eagles.</i>

1:04:58.733 --> 1:05:00.635
<i>Only two seconds left.</i>

1:05:00.668 --> 1:05:02.970
<i>They trail by two points.</i>

1:05:03.003 --> 1:05:06.407
<i>Frankly, it would take
a miracle at this point.</i>

1:05:07.675 --> 1:05:09.209
<i>It's done.</i>

1:05:09.243 --> 1:05:11.646
<i>It's... it's done.</i>

1:05:11.679 --> 1:05:14.214
<i>Another Homecoming loss.</i>

1:05:14.248 --> 1:05:16.250
<i>The curse continues.</i>

1:05:19.319 --> 1:05:20.688
<i>What is the crowd pointing at?</i>

1:05:20.722 --> 1:05:23.457
<i>What is that?</i>

1:05:23.490 --> 1:05:26.594
- Is that Tony Michaels?
- It's the guy, he's here!

1:05:26.628 --> 1:05:30.998
It's the guy, he's here!

1:05:33.300 --> 1:05:34.935
<i>We have a chance!</i>

1:05:38.305 --> 1:05:40.675
- <i>We got this, we got this!</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

1:05:40.708 --> 1:05:43.578
<i>The golden foot is here!</i>

1:05:43.611 --> 1:05:45.212
<i>Better late than never,
Phil!</i>

1:05:56.089 --> 1:05:57.257
<i>What is he doing?</i>

1:05:57.291 --> 1:05:58.827
<i>He has no helmet on.</i>

1:05:58.860 --> 1:06:01.863
<i>Um, I'm very confused.</i>

1:06:20.147 --> 1:06:21.850
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

1:07:33.755 --> 1:07:35.289
<i>Well, Phil,
I'm not sure what</i>

1:07:35.322 --> 1:07:39.561
<i>I just witnessed there,
but the crowd is hyped!</i>

1:08:02.650 --> 1:08:03.785
<i>Hold down!</i>

1:08:08.556 --> 1:08:09.958
<i>It is...</i>

1:08:09.991 --> 1:08:11.224
<i>Good!</i>

1:08:15.930 --> 1:08:17.665
<i>It's a school record!</i>

1:08:20.635 --> 1:08:24.237
<i>The drought is over!
The drought is over!</i>

1:08:32.179 --> 1:08:34.481
- <i>Yes!</i>
- <i>Yes!</i>

1:11:37.799 --> 1:11:38.933
Cut!

1:11:38.966 --> 1:11:41.235
Wow, what an amazing ending.

1:11:56.717 --> 1:11:58.318
<i>One more.</i>

1:11:58.351 --> 1:11:59.419
<i>You got one more in you?</i>

1:11:59.452 --> 1:12:01.022
- I do!
- <i>You do, I know you do.</i>

1:12:01.055 --> 1:12:02.089
<i>Who else?</i>

1:12:02.123 --> 1:12:03.191
I do!
