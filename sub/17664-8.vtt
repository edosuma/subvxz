-Your father didn't have a favorite.

for some time.

05:01.802 --> 05:06.592
These latest events, internationally,
merely strengthen our view.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.345
But sending the Queen
on this forthcoming tour,

05:10.436 --> 05:11.926
in the current climate,

05:12.021 --> 05:15.980
would be to put the Sovereign in
an unacceptable level of danger.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.558
What is it you would have the Queen do?
Stay at home

05:20.279 --> 05:24.648
in the wake of minor incidents
prosecuted by an insurgent rabble?

05:24.909 --> 05:30.154
What kind of signal would that send?
The Crown does not back down.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.413
If Britain had made a habit of backing down,

05:33.542 --> 05:37.410
the world would already be
living under the yoke of fascist tyranny,

05:37.588 --> 05:39.249
and we wouldn't have an empire at all.

05:39.340 --> 05:43.549

we bypass Gibraltar altogether?

demanding independence.

We must be considerate of her.

It's going to be hot, Your Majesty.

06:13.541 --> 06:16.704
To that end, we've been working
a great deal with organza,

06:16.794 --> 06:19.206

06:19.797 --> 06:22.960
We also wanted to feature
something particular to each location,

indigenous to each country
that you're visiting.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.887

we propose a white organza dress

Isn't this all a bit much?
Couldn't we try to economize?

06:53.581 --> 06:57.165

the King told me many times

16:08.051 --> 16:11.509
that he could feel it all slipping away.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.929
The empire, our place in the world.

16:15.809 --> 16:20.269
He saw this tour as a chance
to keep each dominion close,

16:20.397 --> 16:22.558
preserving that empire.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.604
So, take him with you in spirit. Let his...

16:29.573 --> 16:34.317
Let his example guide you,
his thoughts influence you.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.946
-I will.
-And ifl may...

16:40.792 --> 16:45.126
Never let them see
the real Elizabeth Windsor.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.965
The cameras, the television.

16:50.051 --> 16:56.263
Never let them see
that carrying the Crown is often a burden.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.348
Let them look at you,

17:00.312 --> 17:04.271
but let them see only the eternal.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.614
Thank you, Winston.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.696
Your Majesty.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.754

18:18.348 --> 18:20.839
DORIS: Well done! You made it!

18:21.226 --> 18:24.218
QUEEN MOTHER: If it was easy to come here,
everybody would.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.720
-Thank God it isn't, and they don't.
-(BOTH CHUCKLE)

18:27.732 --> 18:29.848
-VYNER: Will you want a rest?
-Certainly not.

18:30.026 --> 18:33.564
I've been sitting for hours.
I want a nice, long walk.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.028
Or, better still, a ride.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.163
Go on. Go get him.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.685
Ah, Scotland, the beauty.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.570
I'd almost forgotten what it feels like
to have the spirits lifted.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.658
Well, you're welcome to stay any time
to get away from it all.

19:21.745 --> 19:24.953
You'd soon grow sick of me.
You know what they say, guests and fish.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.576
(ALL LAUGH)

19:28.251 --> 19:29.752
Or you could become a neighbor.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.580
There's a castle along the coast for sale.

19:32.922 --> 19:35.789
They're threatening to tear it down.
The owner can't afford to keep it up.

19:35.884 --> 19:39.092
Chap called Imbert-Terry. Strange fellow.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.173
Rumor is that, on occasion,

19:41.264 --> 19:44.927
he sings to the seals
that swim past the castle.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.846
(LAUGHS)

19:47.270 --> 19:48.680
How queer.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.515
Has it been very difficult?

19:58.656 --> 19:59.862
It has.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.074
I don't want to sound self-piteous,

20:03.787 --> 20:06.278
but loss has followed loss.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.788
First and foremost, the loss of a husband.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.502
Then the loss of a home,

20:12.712 --> 20:14.543
having to leave the palace.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.837
The loss of motherhood
as daughters become adults.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.504
Loss of a routine, a sense of purpose.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.767
The loss of the Crown.

20:28.478 --> 20:33.689
Imagine 17 years' experience as Queen,
of being the head of the family.

20:34.317 --> 20:38.731
Bertie was a wonderful husband and father,
but he needed a great deal of help as King.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.945
And then we lose him,

20:41.783 --> 20:44.695
and at precisely the moment
when they should be giving me more to do,

20:45.161 --> 20:48.278
stop me falling into despair,
they take it all away.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.000
They take it all away.

20:58.716 --> 21:03.506
They put it all into the hands of a girl
who's totally unequipped for it.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.350
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

21:16.401 --> 21:20.269
ELIZABETH: "Bermuda will always have
a distinguished position

21:20.363 --> 21:22.479

21:59.277 --> 22:02.235
Hmm. "Stay loyal or die." Is that it now?
Can we knock off?

22:02.405 --> 22:03.815
I'm afraid not, sir.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.818
Without wishing to rush you, ma'am,

22:05.909 --> 22:07.865
we do need to move on
as quickly as possible.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.408
Yes, of course.

MICHAEL: Your Majesty?

22:14.876 --> 22:16.707
So sorry, ma'am,
I really can't manage any faster.

22:16.794 --> 22:18.534
-Please don't worry.
-Ready for you, ma'am.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.086
Give her a chance!

22:21.382 --> 22:24.624
I'm in the navy again.
Eight minutes. Not nine, not seven.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.135
MICHAEL: It’s from there to the next location,
where you’ll make a speech

22:28.223 --> 22:29.838
to ex-servicemen at the Royal Yacht Club,

22:29.933 --> 22:33.926
then by ferry to visit a school near
Mangrove Bay on the west of the island.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.389
Then you will host a garden party here
at the Governor's house...

22:36.481 --> 22:37.641
Right.

22:37.774 --> 22:38.889
...for 1,000 or so guests,

22:38.983 --> 22:42.350
where we're hoping to find a moment
for the ceremonial planting of a tree.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.528
PHILIP: Will we find a moment
during any of this to use the lavatory?

22:45.615 --> 22:47.776
I do hope tomorrow's better.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.573
I'm afraid not, sir.

22:49.661 --> 22:52.277
Up at 4:30 for a 6:00 am. flight to Jamaica.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.538

Here we go again, waving like Iunatics.

22:59.629 --> 23:00.744
Oh, God.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.170
With any luck, one day,
they'll all own television sets,

23:03.258 --> 23:05.340
and they won't come out like this again.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.967
MICHAEL: Ma'am, sir, just before we take off,

23:08.054 --> 23:11.512
I thought I might go through the itinerary
for our first day in Jamaica.

This was written for my sister.
Very well written.

-Thank you.
-Manifestly for her.

25:14.138 --> 25:18.256
In her register, reflecting her character,
if that's the right word.

25:18.893 --> 25:21.430
As we both know,
I have a different character.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.556
Indeed.

25:22.647 --> 25:25.684
And since I shall be deputizing
for my sister tonight,

25:25.775 --> 25:30.610
Iwas wondering ifl might make
one or two minor adjustments to the text?

25:30.697 --> 25:33.530
-Ma'am?
-Give it a bit more color.

25:33.616 --> 25:38.030
Make it feel a bit more like me
and breathe a little life into it.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.948
I'm sure Her Royal Highness appreciates it.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.780

25:42.917 --> 25:47.502
There'll be important people
at the reception tonight.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.296
Different backgrounds,
different sensibilities.

25:51.509 --> 25:56.594
The speech has been carefully calibrated
to avoid giving offense.

25:56.931 --> 25:59.138
And I'd suggest to avoid entertaining, too.

25:59.267 --> 26:02.134
It's not the Sovereign's place to entertain.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.978
-And I'm not the Sovereign.
-I understand that,

26:06.858 --> 26:08.439
but you will be there in her place.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.235

26:20.163 --> 26:24.031
What about the State Diadem tiara?
Or the Cambridge Lover's Knot?

26:24.333 --> 26:26.995
Those are Her Majesty's
and for state occasions.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.035
Her Majesty won't mind.

26:29.756 --> 26:33.294
Besides, are people not coming tonight
expecting to meet a queen?

26:34.010 --> 26:36.592
-Yes.
-Shouldn't we be giving them one?

Your Excellencies,

27:14.884 --> 27:18.877
I am delighted to be here tonight,
deputizing for my sister, the Queen,

27:19.430 --> 27:21.671
who is fortunate enough to be on her travels,

27:22.099 --> 27:25.432
somewhere between Bermuda,
Jamaica and Fiji.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.436
Distracted, no doubt,

27:29.607 --> 27:33.441
by waving fields of sugar cane
and graceful palms,

27:34.779 --> 27:38.271
by deep blue water
beyond white coral sands,

27:38.908 --> 27:42.867
by dramatic green hills,
thick with vegetation,

27:43.329 --> 27:46.116
and the subtle rhythms
of dancing and singing.

27:47.750 --> 27:51.743
But more vivid, more brilliant even,

27:51.838 --> 27:56.207
than the colors of those lovely islands
or the echoes of that music

27:56.300 --> 27:59.383
or the welcome
of cheerful and friendly people,

27:59.470 --> 28:01.586
wherever my sister may travel,

28:01.806 --> 28:05.048
is what I see as I look out
from this stage tonight.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.561

28:07.770 --> 28:10.261
As I look out at all of you tonight,

28:10.606 --> 28:13.598
my, don't you all look wonderful.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.275
And shimmering.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.895
And positively exotic.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.275
(LAUGHTER CONTIN U ES)

28:20.408 --> 28:23.491
And what fine company
we have here tonight!

28:23.744 --> 28:26.121
Our ambassador
to the United States of America,

28:26.205 --> 28:27.741
Sir Roger Makins.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.823
The only honest thing
to come out of Washington.

28:32.795 --> 28:37.038
Our dashing ambassador
Alec Kirkbride in Libya.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.544

28:41.429 --> 28:43.294
And of course Sir Charles Peake
and his wife from Greece.

which has brought us many things.

28:55.610 --> 28:58.317
So, to all of you I say welcome!

28:58.905 --> 29:03.239
As a rule, the food here is pretty ordinary,
the wine is usually rather good.

29:03.492 --> 29:06.325
And I have made sure there is plenty of it.

29:07.788 --> 29:11.451
So, I have no doubt
we will have a wonderful evening.

as they like for the next few months.

the debutantes ball.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.358
Well, why not?

29:43.532 --> 29:45.784
Couldn't you come watch me in action?

29:46.202 --> 29:47.282
Just once.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.110
If I thought it were without risk,
Iwould in a flash,

29:49.205 --> 29:50.911
but if the papers get hold of it...

29:51.165 --> 29:53.030
Darling, papers love us.

there's a civic hall to visit.

And the lunches to be consumed.

-No. Almost. You go ahead.

There was an ambassadors' reception
in London last week.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.292
Apparently, Margaret was dazzling
and brilliant.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.086
Would you have preferred
she make a mess of it?

30:41.966 --> 30:43.172
No.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.043
Perhaps.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.962
-|s that awful of me?
-Yes.

30:50.141 --> 30:52.382
Well, now you know,
you didn't marry a saint.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.343
I knew that.
But I wouldn't worry, I have great faith in her.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.978
-In Margaret?
-In her ability to mess things up.

30:58.232 --> 31:01.349
-In the long run.
-Or outshine me.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.776
-And mess things up.
-And outshine me.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.784
That's unlike you.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.791
I'm sorry.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.129
You know, there is a danger
we might be overdoing it.

31:27.344 --> 31:31.132
Perhaps it would be prudent

31:31.640 --> 31:33.221
to take a few things out.

31:33.976 --> 31:37.719
I mean, 57 Australian towns in 58 days.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.979
Maybe we don't visit all of them.

31:46.614 --> 31:47.820
No.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.364
No.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.574
We keep every appointment.

31:54.538 --> 31:57.154
No cancellations. Not one.

some challenges, ma'am.

I'm going to be entirely honest.

35:02.768 --> 35:07.558
The roof does need a bit of work.

35:08.190 --> 35:10.476
One or two windows might need replacing,

35:10.567 --> 35:14.776

35:47.980 --> 35:50.346

35:56.780 --> 35:59.863

-Stop smiling.
-No.

that, if I'm not smiling,

47:42.777 --> 47:44.153

Death threats were sent to all the leaders
of the major political parties,

telling them that,
if our tour were to go to Gibraltar,

47:53.163 --> 47:54.744
our safety can't be guaranteed.

-What do you mean "why"?

the streets of Gibraltar like a sitting duck.

48:07.469 --> 48:08.458
No.

48:09.262 --> 48:11.969
Pulling out at this late hour
would make us look weak.

And it would be a great disappointment
to the people of Gibraltar.

-I say we go.
-I say we don't.

48:24.652 --> 48:28.486
I am aware that I am surrounded by people

48:28.573 --> 48:31.360

48:32.744 --> 48:37.363

more natural leaders,

the crown has landed on my head.

48:45.465 --> 48:47.046
And I say we go.

48:55.850 --> 48:59.058
REPORTER: The Royal Yacht Britannia
sails towards Gibraltar.

48:59.145 --> 49:02.683
Visible on deck, Her Majesty the Queen,
and the Duke of Edinburgh.

49:02.774 --> 49:04.639
Accompanying Britannia,

49:04.818 --> 49:09.107
15 A-c/ass destroyers
from the Mediterranean fleet.

49:09.364 --> 49:11.901
-(GUNS FIRING)
-They’re shooting with a 21-gun salute.

49:13.201 --> 49:15.783
-(CROWD CHEERING)
-A powerful signal to the people of Gibraltar

49:15.870 --> 49:19.033
of the Queen and the British Empire’s
enduring support.

49:43.773 --> 49:49.234
...magniﬁcent tour has already marked
Her Majesty as a woman of destiny.

49:52.073 --> 49:57.067
Her return to London after 50, 000 miles
by air, land and sea

49:57.162 --> 50:01.656
is a triumph of diplomacy
at a challenging time for the empire.

50:03.084 --> 50:07.248
Not a single item of the enormous list
of engagements has been missed.

50:09.382 --> 50:11.748
Millions have seen and greeted their Queen

50:11.843 --> 50:14.585
as she leaves the Commonwealth
charmed and united.

50:18.683 --> 50:21.846
It is already clear
that Her Majesty will occupy a place

50:21.936 --> 50:24.928
among the famous queens of history

50:25.023 --> 50:29.107
and promises a renewed role for Britain
in the modern world.

50:30.862 --> 50:34.730
The empire secure
across the four corners of the Earth,

50:34.824 --> 50:38.362
marking the start of a new Elizabethan Age.

50:50.173 --> 50:51.583
-Hello.
-Your Majesty.

50:53.968 --> 50:56.630
-(CH|LDREN LAUGHING)
-(DOGS BARKING)

50:56.721 --> 50:58.336
Ah-ha!

50:58.431 --> 50:59.671
Yes!

51:02.852 --> 51:04.513
-MICHAEL: Ma'am.
-(DOGS WHINING)

51:04.604 --> 51:06.469
-The Prime Minister's arrived.
-PHILIP: One, two, three, go!

51:06.564 --> 51:08.065
-Thank you.
-PHILIP: I'm fast.

51:08.149 --> 51:10.856
-Daddy! I'm going to get you.
-No, no, no! Not the chair! Not the chair!

51:10.985 --> 51:12.850
-(CHILDREN LAUGH)
-PHILIP: Mind the dogs!

51:12.946 --> 51:14.732
-You can't get away from me!
-I can get away from you.

51:16.783 --> 51:18.944
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

51:20.787 --> 51:23.574
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.
-Thank you, Winston.

51:23.665 --> 51:27.249
-An unqualified triumph.
-A narrow escape, I say.

51:27.335 --> 51:28.745
It could so easily have gone the other way.

51:28.836 --> 51:33.421
Well, but it didn't,
and has put us right back where we belong.

51:33.508 --> 51:35.089
Higher, in fact.

51:35.802 --> 51:39.511
And, before the tour,
our great nation was in danger

51:39.973 --> 51:45.343
of losing much of its status, our influence,
our standing.

51:46.020 --> 51:49.433
Your courage and conviction prevailed.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.186
This time, perhaps.

51:52.568 --> 51:54.900
But in time they will surely grow tired of it.

51:55.613 --> 51:58.320
-Grow tired of us.
-Only if the Crown

51:58.825 --> 52:01.316
and the people representing the Crown

52:02.370 --> 52:05.407
make mistakes, errors ofjudgment.

52:05.957 --> 52:08.073
-My dear sister?
-Yes.

52:09.836 --> 52:11.542
What would you have me do?

52:21.139 --> 52:23.300
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Your Majesty?

52:23.391 --> 52:26.224
-Her Royal Highness is on her way.
-Thank you.

52:28.688 --> 52:30.895
MARGARET: It's all right.
I have been here before.

52:32.233 --> 52:33.769
I do know the way.

52:45.246 --> 52:47.862
-What, in there?
-Yes, ma'am.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.077
(SCOFFS)

53:04.432 --> 53:05.922
(DOOR OPENS)

53:10.438 --> 53:11.678
Goodness.

53:15.151 --> 53:16.732
(CHUCKLES)

53:23.701 --> 53:25.987
What have I done to deserve this?

53:26.079 --> 53:27.194
The brief was simple.

53:28.456 --> 53:32.950
Perform minor ceremonial tasks
with a minimum of fuss.

53:33.878 --> 53:35.584
Not end up all over the newspapers.

53:35.671 --> 53:37.923
I can't help it if they want to write about me.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.461
Well, it would help
if you didn't give them what they crave.

53:41.552 --> 53:44.339
-Character and excitement.
-Instability and drama.

53:44.430 --> 53:47.046
Well, at least I give them something.
You give them nothing.

53:47.975 --> 53:50.808
-I give them silence.
-Silence is nothing.

53:51.020 --> 53:55.263
-It's the absence of noise.
-Emptiness, blank page.

53:55.483 --> 53:58.145
-Which allows others to shine.
-But the Monarchy should shine.

53:58.236 --> 54:00.067
The Monarchy, yes.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.269
Not the Monarch.

54:03.491 --> 54:05.527
Reparations will need to be made.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.491
To whom?

54:08.121 --> 54:09.782
To the people you offended.

54:11.541 --> 54:14.032
A general, to whom,
when asked if you'd like to dance,

54:14.168 --> 54:16.750
you replied, "Yes, but not with you."

54:17.630 --> 54:20.292
I believe there was also a debutante
who you managed to make cry,

54:20.383 --> 54:22.590
and the dancers of Sadler's Wells,

54:22.677 --> 54:26.886
whom you refused to meet
after arriving late for the performance.

54:26.973 --> 54:28.713
You showed individuality.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.181
And that made people panic.

54:31.519 --> 54:33.350
They don't want individuality.

54:33.938 --> 54:37.851
The last person who showed character
almost took the ship down.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.355
You are enjoying this.

54:43.573 --> 54:45.655
-Not a bit.
-Yes, you are.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.202
Admonishing your unruly young sister.

54:55.168 --> 54:56.999
Have you ever thought
how it must be for me?

54:57.086 --> 55:00.578
Many times, at great length, wistfully.

55:00.673 --> 55:04.461
You have a role, a clear set of rules.

55:04.552 --> 55:05.962
All you have to do is follow them.

55:06.053 --> 55:09.591
Margaret, you have freedom.
All you have to do is enjoy it.

55:09.682 --> 55:11.422
You think that I am free?

55:11.517 --> 55:15.055
To be constantly in your shadow,
constantly the overlooked one.

55:15.146 --> 55:18.183
-It looks like heaven to me.
-What you have looks like heaven to me.

55:26.616 --> 55:28.652
Two sisters who envy one another.

55:30.453 --> 55:32.159
We wouldn't be the first.

55:38.503 --> 55:39.993
Pride and Joy.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.758
Remember what Papa called us.

55:45.718 --> 55:46.798
Yes.

55:48.596 --> 55:51.884
"Elizabeth is my pride,
and Margaret is myjoy."

55:53.100 --> 55:55.091
"'But' Margaret is myjoy."

55:58.231 --> 56:01.769
I'm sorry.
I have to claim the few victories I'm left with.

56:03.402 --> 56:05.393
We're not disputing it, surely?

56:07.281 --> 56:10.068
-What?
-That I was Papa's favorite.

56:18.084 --> 56:20.200
There's a cruel truth to it, isn't there?

56:21.128 --> 56:23.505
When there are two sisters so close in age,

56:24.131 --> 56:26.668
the more one becomes one thing,
the more the other

56:27.385 --> 56:29.501
necessarily becomes the opposite,

56:30.471 --> 56:31.802
and vice versa.

56:32.515 --> 56:34.096
It's the way of things.

56:34.850 --> 56:35.976
If one is the Queen,

56:36.060 --> 56:38.392
it must be the source of honor,
all that is good,

56:38.479 --> 56:43.018
the other necessarily becomes
the focus of the most

56:44.569 --> 56:46.150
creative malice.

56:47.488 --> 56:48.568
Evil sister.

56:49.657 --> 56:51.147
No one says you're evil.

56:51.242 --> 56:53.779
Next to you, I will always be evil.

56:54.954 --> 56:56.319
Feckless.

56:57.415 --> 56:58.621
Lost

57:00.293 --> 57:01.749
Lesser thing.

57:06.632 --> 57:10.045
And yet you spend so much time
telling me that I'm a lesser thing.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.095
Only to give myself a moment's peace.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.770
Would you consider doing it for me?

57:29.071 --> 57:31.357
-Just from time to time.
-What?

57:32.033 --> 57:35.366
Putting a foot wrong.
The occasional mistake.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.614
Let the side down.

57:38.539 --> 57:41.872
So I might not be so conspicuous a failure
by comparison.

57:41.959 --> 57:44.996
-You're tired.
-No, I'm not. Not tired.

57:48.841 --> 57:51.548
I'm just asking for a future I can bear.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.925
Margaret.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.933
Do I have your word
that those apologies will be made?

58:13.324 --> 58:16.441
We can help you draft letters
or make statements.

58:21.749 --> 58:22.989
No need.
