WEBVTT

00:13.555 --> 00:14.670
Hurry up, Morty.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.347
Grandpa's about
to un-freeze time.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.595
You really should be cleaning
from top to bottom.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.517
I know how to vacuum mom
and dad, Summer.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.186
I've been doing it
for six months.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.684
Then you've been doing it
wrong for six months.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.482
Oh, my God,
is that mildew?

00:26.568 --> 00:28.650
It's not my fault we froze
time on a humid day.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.820
You have dropped
so many balls, man.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.818
Do you ever get scared
Grandpa Rick

00:33.909 --> 00:35.650
might make me
his new sidekick?

00:35.744 --> 00:37.610
What?!
What kind of monster are you?

00:37.704 --> 00:38.990
A competent one.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.196
Who cares about the
things you guys are

00:40.290 --> 00:41.405
talking about?

00:41.500 --> 00:42.786
The whole point
of freezing time was to

00:42.876 --> 00:44.867
stop giving a fuck.
Put a shirt on your dumb dad,

00:44.962 --> 00:47.203
and let's get
this dumb universe rolling.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.913
Let's do this thing.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.675
All right, listen,
you two.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.548
We froze time
for a pretty long time,

00:55.639 --> 00:56.754
so when I un-freeze it,

00:56.848 --> 00:58.338
the world's time
is gonna be fine,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.265
but our time's
gonna need a little time

01:00.352 --> 01:01.592
to, you know, stabilize.

01:01.687 --> 01:02.722
Our time
is gonna be unstable?

01:02.813 --> 01:04.349
What does that
even mean?

01:04.438 --> 01:06.430
It means relax
and stop being a pussy, Morty.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.391
Uh, I thought
you learned that by now.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.896
It also means
don't touch your parents,

01:09.987 --> 01:11.819
or we could shatter into
countless theoretical shards.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.272
- Wait a minute, what?
- And away we go!

01:15.576 --> 01:16.566
♪♪

01:19.538 --> 01:21.870
Um...did we ever put
that mattress under Mr. Benson?

01:21.957 --> 01:23.413
- Shhh.
- Shush, Morty.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.582
...a thing or two about --
Wait, what?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.580
Was the house --
when we pulled up,

01:27.671 --> 01:30.504
I could have sworn the house
was completely trashed.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.831
Negative visualization,
Jerry.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.666
Explains a lot
about where you're at.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.626
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Dad.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.587
Summer, Morty,
are you okay?

01:37.681 --> 01:39.513
We -- we just
missed you a lot.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.216
Yeah,
we missed you so much.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.721
Too much to hug you,
though.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.427
Yeah, it would
literally destroy them.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.262
Now, listen, why don't --
why don't -- wh-why don't --

01:46.356 --> 01:47.892
why don't you guys go
get a free Sunday ice cream?

01:47.983 --> 01:49.473
Get out there
and get some ice creams.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.855
Here's $500 cash
in unmarked monies.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.731
I'm just gonna put it
on the floor

01:53.822 --> 01:55.404
and kick it on over to ya.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.481
- You guys go nuts.
- This better not be a bribe.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.614
If I find a single thing
out of place in this house,

02:00.704 --> 02:02.786
my love of ice cream
won't save you.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.409
I'll get my jacket.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.662
Sweetie, is your shirt
on backwards?

02:09.545 --> 02:11.878
Yeah.
I like it this way.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.330
I'm not stupid.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.631
- Phew!
- Oh.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.459
Man, that guy
is the Redgren Grumbholdt

02:16.553 --> 02:18.385
of pretending he knows
what's going on.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.887
- Oh, you agree, huh?
- It's funny.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.884
You like that Redgren Grumbholdt
reference?

02:21.975 --> 02:22.931
Yeah.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.508
Well, guess what?
I made him up.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.185
You really are
your father's children.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.012
Think for yourselves.
Don't be sheep.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.891
God, I feel terrible.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.514
Yep, it really makes
you appreciate

03:08.605 --> 03:09.891
how fickle
the Universe can be.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.518
One minute you're falling
off a roof for six months,

03:12.609 --> 03:13.849
the next minute, bam!

03:13.944 --> 03:15.776
Uh, just to be clear,
it was Summer's job

03:15.862 --> 03:17.227
to put the mattress under --

03:17.322 --> 03:18.653
Uh, what?
It was your job, Morty.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.821
- Nuh-uh!
- Yuh-huh!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.239
Actually, sorry, Summer.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.532
I got to back the "M" bomb
on this one.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.075
I remember
the conversation.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.574
We told Morty to replace all
the bank's money with cookies.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.702
Your job was to put the
mattress under Mr. Benson.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.999
Boom!
In your face, Summer!

03:31.086 --> 03:32.747
You really dropped
the ball, man.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.829
Shut up, Morty,
you vindictive little turd!

03:34.923 --> 03:38.006
You shut up,
you big female asshole!

03:38.093 --> 03:39.379
Hey, don't shove me!

03:39.469 --> 03:40.630
- I didn't!
- You didn't what?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.257
- What's your problem?
- What's yours?

03:42.347 --> 03:43.428
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

03:43.515 --> 03:44.801
Wh-whoa, whoa!

03:44.891 --> 03:47.223
What the hell, hell,
hell, hell, hell?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.472
Oh, god. Oh, no.
What did you guys just do?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.724
- What did who do?
- What do you mean?

03:50.814 --> 03:52.725
- Wait, what am I saying?
- Were either

03:52.816 --> 03:54.807
of you guys uncertain
about anything just now?

03:54.901 --> 03:56.483
Oh, man,
I don't feel good.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.856
- Am I me?
- Am I talking right now?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.528
- I think so.
- Wait, who said that?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.275
All right,
both of you just don't move.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.700
Don't speak, don't think.
I have to check something.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.821
- What'd you do, Morty?
- I'm gonna help grandpa.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.073
I'll see if
he needs help.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.370
<i>What do you mean you're
gonna help him?</i>

04:08.457 --> 04:09.947
I can help, too.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.247
- What's happening, Grandpa?
- What's going on, Rick?

04:11.334 --> 04:12.870
Sh-sh-shut up.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.453
Oh, crap, are you kidding me?
Two dots?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.163
This never needs to be
more than one dot.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.588
The two of you made us
uncertain!

04:18.675 --> 04:19.584
- What are you talking about?
- What's that mean?

04:19.676 --> 04:20.711
- English, please.
- English?

04:20.802 --> 04:23.294
Our time is fractured --
you two somehow created

04:23.388 --> 04:25.720
a feedback look of uncertainty
that split our reality

04:25.807 --> 04:28.265
into two equally possible
impossibilities.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.592
W-we're exactly like a man
capable of sustaining

04:30.687 --> 04:33.395
a platonic friendship with
an attractive female co-worker.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.393
We're entirely hypothetical.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.521
But I thought there were
infinite time lines?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.602
We're not
on any time line, dummy.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.687
Look.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.943
Oh, my god!

04:43.033 --> 04:44.364
Are those cats?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.488
I assume
they're Schrodinger's cats.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.909
Or, actually, I assume

04:47.996 --> 04:49.612
they both are and aren't,
just like us.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.322
- Is the world gone?
- Is the world gone?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.781
- Where are Mom and Dad?
- What about Mom and Dad?

04:52.876 --> 04:55.334
Mom and Dad? Get your head
out of your family's ass.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.536
The three of us are lost
in a timeless oblivion.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.996
Your parents get to exist.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.331
They're probably living it up
in some pointless,

05:01.426 --> 05:03.508
grounded story
about their shitty marriage.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.427
Cold stone creamery is the best.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.427
What should we do
with our remaining $20?

05:08.517 --> 05:11.305
You realize they sing
no matter how much you tip?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.930
- Whoa!
- Aaah!

05:13.021 --> 05:14.352
Holy shit.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.021
- What happened?
- I hit a deer.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.348
We -- we have to tell
the cops you were driving.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.605
- What?
- This is rum raisin!

05:22.948 --> 05:24.530
It's still alive.

05:24.616 --> 05:28.029
Well, do we -- do I, uh,
get, uh, a big rock, or...?

05:28.119 --> 05:29.780
It's not
an armadillo, asshole.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.657
I thought that's what
a man's supposed to say.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.364
It's not like
I could've actually done it.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.369
If we were near a hospital,
I could treat it,

05:35.460 --> 05:36.825
but I --
I think we have to just...

05:36.920 --> 05:39.503
It's okay. This is
just something that happens.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.297
And even if we were
in a hospital, what could we do?

05:42.384 --> 05:44.546
You're a horse surgeon,
not a deer surgeon.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.751
So...?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.302
Well,
don't different animals...

05:47.389 --> 05:48.845
require different levels
of skill to keep alive?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.514
- Oh, god.
- Get the deer in the car, Jerry.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.886
Yes, Beth.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.888
This is why you
don't freeze time, you guys.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.561
It's incredibly
irresponsible.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.854
And you did it so we could clean
the house after a party?

05:57.941 --> 06:00.524
Look, there's no time
to hold me accountable, Morty.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.351
Like, literally no time.
Look around.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.686
Uncertainty
is inherently unsustainable.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.863
Eventually, everything
either is or isn't.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.362
And we've got about
four hours to be "Is."

06:09.452 --> 06:11.489
- Or...?
- We isn't.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.162
All right, since this time
crystal exists in both

06:13.248 --> 06:14.238
possibilities,

06:14.666 --> 06:16.577
and since it's impossible
that I didn't nail this,

06:16.668 --> 06:18.454
I'm probably about
to press this button

06:18.545 --> 06:20.627
in both possibilities
at exactly the same time.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.250
- How do you know --
- How do you know that --

06:22.340 --> 06:23.876
Whatever your asking me,
the answer is I'm amazing.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.878
And away we go.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.592
Huh, what do you know.
It's working.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.300
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh shit.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.476
What the hell
is wrong with you two?

06:36.563 --> 06:37.724
I-I-I-I mean you four!

06:37.814 --> 06:39.680
That hurt! That was painful.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.731
Good, I'm glad it was painful.
You deserve it.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.526
I saw you. Y-You're both
all over the damn place.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.695
We've been split for
20 minutes and your lives

06:46.781 --> 06:49.022
are already scattered
to the quantum fucking wind?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.733
What the hell do
either of you two

06:50.827 --> 06:53.285
have to be so uncertain about?
Your brand of zit cream?

06:53.371 --> 06:55.362
Which chair to sit in
while I do everything?

06:55.457 --> 06:56.618
Come on, spit it out!

06:56.708 --> 06:57.618
Well, you don't exactly
make it easy, Rick.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.040
You make fun of me
all the time...

06:59.127 --> 07:00.617
You're always picking on me...
...and now Summer's doing it.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.543
...and now you got Summer
to kiss your <i>ass.</i>

07:01.630 --> 07:03.041
Me?! What about you?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.121
You're just as mean to me
because you're jealous...

07:04.215 --> 07:05.171
could you get more excited
to see me fail?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.748
Because you want grandpa
all to yourself!

07:06.843 --> 07:08.629
All right, all right, cool it.
I see what's happening here.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.336
You're both young,
you're both unsure

07:10.430 --> 07:11.716
about your place
in the universe,

07:11.806 --> 07:13.592
and you both want
to be Grandpa's favorite.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.390
I can fix this.
Morty, sit here.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.967
Summer, you sit here.
Now, listen.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.644
I know the two of you
are very different

07:18.730 --> 07:19.936
from each other
in a lot of ways,

07:20.023 --> 07:21.388
but you have to understand

07:21.483 --> 07:22.894
that as far
as Grandpa's concerned,

07:22.984 --> 07:24.600
you're both pieces
of shit. Yeah.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.934
I can prove it
mathematically.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.645
Actually, l-l-let me
grab my white board.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.400
This has been
a long time coming, anyway.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.025
Emergency!
Wounded deer coming in.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.735
Three.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.570
Excuse me,
you can't be back here.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.247
I'm a certified
horse surgeon,

07:38.333 --> 07:39.994
and this deer
needs medical attention.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.543
- Nurse, please move that snake.
- That's my nurse.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.495
And as a horse surgeon,
I'm sure that you know

07:44.589 --> 07:47.672
that deer have much smaller,
much more intricate organs.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.750
As a vet, I'm sure you know
that a deer

07:49.844 --> 07:52.256
is closer to a horse
than you are to a doctor.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.714
So let's save the measuring
for when our dicks are out.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.469
- It's time to save a life!
- Geez.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.640
That's odd.
This deer's wounded.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.721
Uh, yeah, I was there.
You don't have to rub it in.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.932
I mean it's been shot
with a gun.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.983
My gun.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.811
May I help <i>you,</i> sir?

08:08.905 --> 08:11.522
No, but you can stop
helping this deer.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.573
I shot it before these two
hit it with their car,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.242
and I followed them
when they hauled it off.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.693
This deer belongs
to me.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.699
We don't have
time for this, okay?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.576
I need anaesthetic
and deer saline.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.704
Look, I don't know what
the law says about this,

08:22.794 --> 08:25.957
but I took an oath that I would
let no animal come to harm.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.754
Except when sterilizing,
aborting, or euthanizing them,

08:27.841 --> 08:30.128
or also when eating them
at also any meal.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.754
I'm calling my lawyer.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.381
I hope for all our sakes
you're as bad a surgeon

08:33.471 --> 08:34.427
as I am a hunter.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.380
In your dreams, bitch.
Scalpel.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.808
So, in conclusion,
you're both equally mercurial,

08:39.894 --> 08:41.635
overly sensitive, clingy,

08:41.730 --> 08:43.971
hysterical,
bird-brained homunculi.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.351
And I honestly can't even tell
the two of you apart

08:45.442 --> 08:46.523
half the time

08:46.609 --> 08:47.770
because I don't go
by height or age,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.602
I go by amount
of pain in my ass,

08:49.696 --> 08:51.061
which makes you
both identical.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.487
All right,
everything resolved?

08:52.574 --> 08:55.316
Everybody nice and certain about
their position in my world.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.320
Yes.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.742
All right, perfect.
Sit still.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.695
arms down.
I'm gonna do this again.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.655
This time be
like Grandpa.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.865
You mean drunk?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.666
What's that?
You got something to say?

09:04.753 --> 09:05.709
- No.
- And away we go!

09:05.795 --> 09:08.913
And away we go!

09:09.007 --> 09:11.795
- Huh, that's weird.
- Huh, that's weird.

09:13.845 --> 09:14.880
- Oh, my god.
- What?

09:14.971 --> 09:15.881
The son of a bitch
is gonna kill me!

09:15.972 --> 09:16.928
What?!

09:17.015 --> 09:17.846
The son of a bitch
is gonna kill me!

09:17.932 --> 09:18.842
What?!

09:18.933 --> 09:20.298
Diabolical,
unfeeling sociopath.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.679
- Don't you get it?!
- Don't you get it?!

09:21.770 --> 09:23.886
The other Rick isn't trying
to merge us anymore.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.186
He thinks
he can save his own skin

09:25.273 --> 09:26.855
by using the
crystal to kill me.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.807
He probably figures
it's easier

09:28.902 --> 09:29.767
to eliminate one
of the possibilities

09:29.861 --> 09:30.976
rather than merge them.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.186
I have to admit,

09:32.280 --> 09:33.987
it was always in the back
of my mind, too.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.940
The difference is
I would never do it, until now.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.115
Rick, what the hell
are you doing?

09:37.202 --> 09:38.738
Saving our lives!

09:38.828 --> 09:41.069
After he takes me out, he's --
he's gonna be coming for you.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.325
- Who?
- Me!

09:42.415 --> 09:43.780
Aah!

09:43.875 --> 09:45.331
- Whoa!
- You see that? Get down!

09:45.418 --> 09:47.204
I told you, he's a psycho.
He's lost it!

09:47.295 --> 09:49.411
Th-th-th-the time fracture
must have made him crazy!

09:49.506 --> 09:50.621
- I don't know what to do!
- Oh, crap!

09:50.715 --> 09:52.706
I don't know what to do!

09:54.511 --> 09:56.093
Oh, god,
now there's three of them.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.635
We're outnumbered.
Get in the cupboards.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.962
Wait, don't --
don't do that.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.388
They'll know.
Wait, wait.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.806
Think about getting in
the cupboards, but don't really.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.682
Is this what you want,
you sick fuck?!

10:06.773 --> 10:08.730
You want to see
children die?!

10:08.817 --> 10:09.807
You son of a bitch.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.188
You don't stop living
until I say so!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.188
Michael.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.690
- Who's this now?
- My lawyer.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.522
I'm here to notify you, ma'am,
that in this county,

10:16.616 --> 10:18.072
any deer shot
by a hunter

10:18.159 --> 10:20.617
is that hunter's property
regardless of how far it runs

10:20.703 --> 10:22.910
or who intercepts it
before it dies.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.408
It's called Brad's law.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.955
We can't make you
stop the surgery,

10:26.042 --> 10:28.124
but at this point,
you're performing it on venison.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.327
Actually,
I've decided not to eat it.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.289
All this fear and conflict --
I'm sure it's ruined the meat.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.671
I'm just gonna use the head
for my rec-room wall.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.672
She normally works
on horses.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.720
Jerry, if you're not gonna help,
get the fuck out of here.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.468
I will reach into heaven

10:42.559 --> 10:44.971
and yank your screaming
deer soul back!

10:45.061 --> 10:46.017
Jesus.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.102
Shh, Shh!

10:48.189 --> 10:50.055
I know where you are,
you creepy old monster.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.265
I know how you think.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.191
Oh, is there where
you think I'm going?

10:53.278 --> 10:54.359
You think I'm standing here?

10:54.445 --> 10:55.856
Well, maybe you're right.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.022
Holy shit. Now what?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.448
Well, if all of me
knocked out all the Ricks,

11:00.535 --> 11:02.151
and you peed
in all of your pants,

11:02.245 --> 11:04.156
doesn't that mean
that we're all synchronized?

11:04.247 --> 11:05.453
- Right.
- Okay.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.907
So, from now on, whatever we do,
we have to be certain.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.991
Right.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.202
I think I'm certain
we're effed in the "A."

11:15.800 --> 11:18.007
Oh, God, my head.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.710
What did you guys do?

11:19.804 --> 11:22.671
We put you in a dog crate
because you were acting crazy

11:22.765 --> 11:24.221
and you caused
another time fracture.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.640
You tried to
kill yourself.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.263
O-Only
in self-defense.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.809
Myself tried
to kill me first.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.387
Guys, I don't expect you
to understand this,

11:30.481 --> 11:32.313
but time breaking twice
means our problem is

11:32.400 --> 11:35.313
two times bigger and we've got
half as much time to solve it.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.269
Well, actually, I do expect
you to understand that.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.900
It's basic math. C-Can somebody
just let me out of here?

11:39.991 --> 11:41.322
If I die in a cage,
I lose a bet.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.070
Well, is there some way
you can prove

11:43.161 --> 11:45.027
you're not a threat to yourself
and others anymore?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.486
Oh, for God's sake.
All right, here.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.572
- Give me the time crystal.
- Wh-what are you doing?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.998
Calling myself.
Here, listen.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.450
It'll probably go
to voicemail

11:52.545 --> 11:54.081
since, you know,
I'm calling myself.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.038
<i>Hello, Rick here.</i>

11:56.132 --> 11:57.213
Don't fall for it.
It's a bit.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.756
<i>Just kidding!
Ha, ha!</i>

11:58.843 --> 11:59.924
<i>You just got Ricked.</i>

12:00.011 --> 12:01.217
<i>You've reached
Rick's voicemail.</i>

12:01.304 --> 12:02.294
<i>You know what to do.</i>

12:02.388 --> 12:03.594
Hey, Rick.
It's Rick.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.048
Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.
No hard feelings.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.099
I know you know I mean it, too.
Take it easy.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.268
Whoa, damn!
Look at this.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.937
I'm blowing up --
three new voicemails.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.309
<i>Hey, Rick.
It's Rick.</i>

12:13.399 --> 12:14.480
<i>Listen,
I'm sorry about earlier.</i>

12:14.567 --> 12:15.477
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard this one.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.808
<i>Hey, Rick.
It's Rick.</i>

12:16.903 --> 12:18.940
- <i>Hey, Rick, it's --</i>
- You get the idea.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.361
W-we're cool now.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.610
Okay, well, we're still not
gonna let you out of this crate.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.361
Fine.
I'll just do it myself.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.819
If you could get out that whole
time, why didn't you?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.654
Because I waited
until I was certain

12:28.748 --> 12:30.238
it was what I wanted
to do, Morty.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.664
That's the difference
between you and me.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.082
I'm certain, and you're

12:33.169 --> 12:35.251
a walking burlap sack
filled with turds.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.499
You know, geez, Rick!

12:36.589 --> 12:38.455
Y-Y-You're really tearing
into me right now.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.584
You know, words hurt.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.087
- Holy!
- A monster!

12:41.177 --> 12:42.884
Hey, you --
Hey, quit yelling.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.633
Quit yelling.
What the fuck

12:45.723 --> 12:47.714
your time is all
ripped up to hell!

12:47.809 --> 12:49.391
You broke your time twice.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.093
How did this happen?

12:52.272 --> 12:55.230
Nevermind. Shut the fuck up.
Goddamn.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.182
I'm from
the fourth dimension.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.813
I can hear all of y'all.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.814
Now let's just see what we
got here for a second.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.521
Goddamn it.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.401
Were you trying
to use this to --

13:04.492 --> 13:07.405
Oh, see, you broke time,
and you thought you could

13:07.495 --> 13:09.406
just stick it back
together with this?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.532
How you think
you gonna move time

13:10.623 --> 13:11.829
while you're
standing in it,

13:11.916 --> 13:14.283
you dumb-ass three-dimensional
monkey-ass dummies?

13:14.377 --> 13:15.617
Oh, way to go, Rick.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.123
Yeah, Grandpa,
way to go.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.874
What, you're just gonna listen
to this guy now?

13:18.965 --> 13:20.831
He's got a giant testicle
for a head.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.165
He came here in a bubble.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.341
For all we know,
he could be

13:23.428 --> 13:25.840
the David Berkowitz
of Nutsackland.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.137
Shut up.
Here, put these on.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.714
They'll sync
your possibilities up

13:29.809 --> 13:31.675
so I can bring you back
to certain time.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.181
Y'all are just --
just -- just negligent.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.933
See, now --
now look right here.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.186
Hey, hey, hey, the three of you,
put your collars on.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.437
- We have them on.
- What are you talking about?

13:39.527 --> 13:40.642
- Uh, we did.
- We're not wearing collars.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.444
Exactly.
'Cause you're being obstinate.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.565
What?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.273
Put the damn collars on
if you want to live.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.607
- They're on right now.
- We did. They're on.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.034
All right, fine.
Summer, Morty, put them on.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.535
- Yes, we're back!
- No more cats!

13:54.625 --> 13:56.457
- We're back in certain time.
- Problem solved.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.579
No more cats!
Oh, you did it!

13:57.670 --> 13:59.502
- You fixed it.
- Yeah, I did.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.171
Now keep those
collars on so you

14:01.257 --> 14:02.668
don't break
your weak-ass time again.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.966
How long, exactly, do we have
to wear these things?

14:05.053 --> 14:06.214
They're really
embarrassing.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.466
Well, since you're going
to time prison,

14:08.556 --> 14:11.048
I'd say you can
keep them on forever.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.473
- Time prison?
- Yeah.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.471
Well, I don't know where you
expect me to think

14:14.562 --> 14:16.098
you got
that crystal over there,

14:16.189 --> 14:20.023
but the only way your dumb-ass
assin' ass asses

14:20.109 --> 14:22.646
could ever have one
is if it was stolen.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.399
You stole a time-freezing
crystal from testicle monsters?!

14:25.490 --> 14:28.073
I would've been happy to pay
for it, S-- Summer,

14:28.159 --> 14:30.150
but they don't exactly
sell them at Costco.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.986
Besides, there's a larger lesson
to be learned here. Get him!

14:33.081 --> 14:34.412
No, no, no, no!
You better keep back!

14:34.499 --> 14:36.081
Man,
this will turn your ass

14:36.167 --> 14:38.204
into a third-trimester fetus
from 30 yards.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.578
Mm.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.710
Isn't there a kitten somewhere
that needs a manicure?

14:44.801 --> 14:47.213
That's right, Mrs. Smith.
Give in to your anger.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.385
Neglect that deer.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.304
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.223
These men are
from the Cervine Institute

14:53.309 --> 14:54.970
of of elk, moose, deer,
and stag.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.722
They can take this deer
to a helicopter

14:56.813 --> 14:58.929
and fly it to the country's
top deer surgeon

14:59.023 --> 15:01.230
on a wildlife reserve
across the state border.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.479
Where
your jurisdiction ends.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.107
I guess
that's the end of that.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.654
There is
just one more thing.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.324
According to this state's
Veterinarian statute,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.243
this animal
can't be transferred

15:13.329 --> 15:15.286
until the current
attending physician

15:15.373 --> 15:17.956
verbally confirms
their inability

15:18.042 --> 15:19.658
to provide adequate care.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.084
You heard the man,
horse doctor.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.539
You have to say
you couldn't hack it.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.375
We did it!

15:28.469 --> 15:30.301
Uh-huh. No, mother -- no.
Earth, dude.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.629
No, I'm talking about --
Yeah, with the dinosaurs.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.306
No, if you get to the dolphin
people, you gone too far.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.475
All right, man,
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.098
You know what they do

15:39.188 --> 15:41.020
to third-dimensional life
forms in time prison?

15:41.107 --> 15:43.189
Same thing they do in every
other prison, only forever.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.562
Why are you doing this?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.984
You think I want to be
an omniscient immortal being

15:47.071 --> 15:48.687
transcending time and space
my whole life?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.112
I got ambitions, man.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.031
Bringing you guys in
is my ticket up.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.031
What if I told you
there's a huge ticket

15:55.121 --> 15:56.236
up right behind you?

15:56.330 --> 15:57.411
You really think
I'm that stupid?

15:57.498 --> 15:59.159
All right,
hear me out on this.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.116
You're immortal, right, which
means your life is infinite.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.121
Okay, well, then that means
there's a 100% chance

16:03.212 --> 16:04.543
that you'll
eventually do everything,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.997
including turning around
to look behind you.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.206
I cannot argue that.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.008
Aaah!

16:10.094 --> 16:12.301
Oh, god, gross and weird!

16:12.388 --> 16:14.470
Chris!

16:14.557 --> 16:16.013
You killed my gun!

16:16.100 --> 16:17.465
Summer, Morty,
take off your collars.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.176
What? What the hell
are you doing?

16:19.270 --> 16:23.605
Good question. I suppose
the answer is I'm not certain.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.181
Oh, no,
what are you doing?

16:25.276 --> 16:26.983
- I have no idea.
- I'm not sure.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.434
Stop it!

16:28.529 --> 16:31.112
Maybe I will,
maybe I won't.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.190
I'm really uncertain
about everything,

16:33.284 --> 16:34.490
even kicking your ass.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.033
List-- hey!
Tw-- ow!

16:36.120 --> 16:38.111
But the-- these arms
are vestigial!

16:38.206 --> 16:39.662
Now, you poked me where
an eye would've been

16:39.749 --> 16:41.490
about 6 million years ago.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.495
Come
on, let's help Grandpa.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.953
Yes!
I'm 100% not sure about anything!

16:46.047 --> 16:47.629
Yeah,
totally uncertain.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.501
Beat his ass!
Get him! Beat him up!

16:49.592 --> 16:51.959
- Kick his ass, Rick!
- Die, motherfucker.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.339
Ow!
I'm defeated.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.340
- What's happening?
- Time is falling apart.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.637
We've got to get back
to certainty quick.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.180
Give me your collars.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.099
Oh, man. Don't you have to fix,
like, 30 of them?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.551
Morty, I have to fix three
of them.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.307
And then there's 31
other versions of me

17:03.397 --> 17:05.980
that have to also fix three,
for a total of 96.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.273
I'm not an idiot.
I know how to be decisive.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.817
Now hand me
that flat-head screwdriver.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.191
- Actually, make it a flat-head.
- Actually, make it a phillips.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.942
Oh, shit.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.821
Look, I know I was
kind of a nuisance today.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.402
I know it's my fault
we hit the deer.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.534
And I know you wanted
to be the one to save it.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.614
Whatever.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.375
How petty would I have
to be to care less

17:25.461 --> 17:27.792
about an animal's life
than my own ego?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.418
Well, you'd have
to be pretty petty.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.500
But you'd still be
the woman I married.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.380
Where are we going?

17:35.471 --> 17:37.587
One last stop.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.133
Where's the helicopter?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.094
There is no helicopter.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.145
And there is
no Cervine Institute.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.814
But the top
deer surgeon...

17:47.900 --> 17:49.686
I'm looking at her.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.938
Thanks for teeing me
up like that.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.268
You better get moving.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.104
These lights are designed
for basic ice-cream work.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.734
They're not gonna last
all night.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.236
I need five minutes.

18:27.648 --> 18:31.687
Jerry, this was the most
romantic weekend I've ever had.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.939
Thanks
to Cold Stone Creamery.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.646
You're welcome.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.447
Okay, collars are done.
Put them on.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.149
We're out of time.
It's ironic, huh?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.281
Huh?
Wait a minute.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.407
- Great.
- Rick!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.408
What's going on?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.285
The collar.
Oh, the latch is broken.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.582
It won't latch closed
around my neck.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.659
- Oh, are you kidding me?
- Geez, what's going on?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.165
How come our collars
aren't green?

18:51.255 --> 18:52.871
Obviously because someone
doesn't know how to put

18:52.965 --> 18:55.502
his collar on, and one of me
is stuck trying to help him.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.799
Don't blame this on me.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.172
You're the one that
couldn't fix a latch.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.627
What are you talking about?
It's not broken, Morty.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.178
I fixed it.
Just put it on.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.006
It won't close.
It's broken.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.841
Fine, bring it here.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.175
Oh!

19:06.270 --> 19:08.056
- Rick!
- Morty!

19:09.440 --> 19:10.896
Oh, really, Morty?
Well, I'm sorry.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.566
I'm not the one who's so fucking
uncertain about everything.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.768
You know what
I'm certain of, Rick?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.478
I've really made up
my mind about this.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.108
I never want
to see you again!

19:18.199 --> 19:20.281
You're never gonna see anything
again, you little dummy!

19:20.368 --> 19:22.780
You killed us!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.201
God damn it.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.278
♪♪

19:29.585 --> 19:30.791
Rick!
Oh!

19:30.878 --> 19:32.209
Morty, where's your collar?
I'll fix it.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.912
I dropped it.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.591
What the hell?
What have you done to me, Morty?

19:39.970 --> 19:42.507
I'm okay with this.
Be good, Morty.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.259
Be better than me.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.766
Oh shit!
The other collar!

19:47.853 --> 19:50.345
I'm not okay with this.
I am not okay with this!

19:50.439 --> 19:51.679
Oh, sweet Jesus,
please let me live.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.356
Oh, my god, I have to --
I've got to fix this thing.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.228
Please, god in heaven.
Please, God.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.809
Oh, lord, hear my prayers.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.941
Yes!
Fuck you, God!

19:59.031 --> 20:01.318
Not today, bitch!

20:01.409 --> 20:03.525
Please, God, if there's a hell,
please be merciful to me.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.654
Yes, I did it!
There is no God!

20:07.748 --> 20:08.988
In your face!

20:09.083 --> 20:10.869
One dot, motherfucker!

20:10.960 --> 20:12.450
Yes!
Oh, yes!

20:12.545 --> 20:15.378
All right, you know
what I'm talking about.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.750
- Oh, that was a close call.
- Oh, yeah!

20:16.841 --> 20:18.331
I'm gonna do
the cabbage patch, Morty.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.416
- Oh, yeah, do it.
- Check me out.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.500
I'm doing
the Cabbage Patch.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.834
- Do it right.
- I'm doing it, too.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.135
- Do the cabbage patch.
- It's a classic dance.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.088
- Do it. Do the dance.
- Oh shit look at that.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.514
Hey, wait a second, how come you
guys took longer to get here?

20:27.601 --> 20:30.935
I don't know. I think, like,
1/64 of my collars didn't work.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.432
It's hard to
keep straight now

20:32.523 --> 20:34.639
that I have 63 other
memories of everything.

20:34.734 --> 20:35.690
Yeah.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.358
But I feel like one
of the 64 Ricks,

20:37.445 --> 20:38.856
like, sacrificed
himself for me?

20:38.946 --> 20:41.563
- Maybe? I think?
- Shut up, Morty.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.944
The last time you felt
something, we all almost died.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.399
You little piece of shit.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.734
Hey, guys, we're home.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.944
Mom! Dad!

20:48.038 --> 20:49.699
Uh, hold the phone.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.282
Where did you guys
get those necklaces from?

20:52.376 --> 20:54.663
Uh, Lady Gaga,
table for three. Am I right?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.870
Are you guys
Power Rangers,

20:56.964 --> 20:58.454
but only on one small part
of your necks?

20:58.549 --> 21:00.085
Hey, do those things
need batteries?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.792
Were they included?
Cleanup in the fruit aisle.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.218
Not in a homophobic way,
though.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.012
They're just fruity necklaces
is what I was saying.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.054
I'm gonna pee my pants!

21:07.141 --> 21:08.051
Somebody call
the planet of "Tron"!

21:08.142 --> 21:09.177
Doesn't feel so
good, does it?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.099
We have three "Tron"
people over here.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.893
No, it doesn't.
It hurts.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.095
Seriously, are these
halloween costumes?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.396
Are you going
as motorcycles

21:15.483 --> 21:17.224
with green headlights
instead of normal ones?

21:17.318 --> 21:19.309
Are you dogs?
Robot dogs?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.770
Gosh,
you guys are lame.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.730
Are those chokers
from the '90s?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.486
What is this,
a '90s nostalgia thing?

21:26.577 --> 21:30.036
Are you guys in that movie
"The Craft" with Fairuza Balk?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.316
Hey, man,
when the hell were you?

22:08.410 --> 22:09.696
Looking for you,
asshole.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.198
I told you
past the dinosaurs.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.529
You know how much time
is past the dinosaurs?

22:13.624 --> 22:14.739
Half of all time!

22:14.834 --> 22:15.790
Come on, man.
It's this way.

22:15.876 --> 22:16.957
- Come on.
- Give me that thing.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.205
Speed it up.
He can't be this far back.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.581
No, no, there he is.
There he is. There he is.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.958
There he is.
Stop, stop.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.164
- So, that's the guy, huh?
- Yeah, that's him.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.841
Hey, man.
Remember me?

22:24.927 --> 22:26.463
I got something for your ass.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.545
Don't...mess...with time!

22:28.639 --> 22:30.880
You don't fuck
with time!

22:30.975 --> 22:31.965
Motherfucker!

22:37.565 --> 22:41.103
I will mess with time.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.775
I will mess with time.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.402
Did you get any of that?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.480
It's a good show.
