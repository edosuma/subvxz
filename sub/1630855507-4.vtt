00:02.103 --> 00:06.940
* MTV...

00:06.974 --> 00:09.177
[music]

00:24.258 --> 00:26.260
[laughing]

00:31.565 --> 00:33.534
- What a whore.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.035
- You know her?

00:35.069 --> 00:37.605
- No, I'm talking about him.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.940
- You should write him off
before he gives you a disease.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.985
- How is the match making going?

00:52.019 --> 00:53.121
- Match making?

00:53.154 --> 00:54.122
- Your uncle.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.523
- No takers yet, I guess.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.525
- Do you know the families
he is considering?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.360
- To be honest,
marriage is the last thing

00:59.393 --> 01:00.528
on my mind right now.

01:00.561 --> 01:04.665
I just...
I want to finish school.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.100
I want to have my own life.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.535
- You're so American.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.238
Woo!

01:10.271 --> 01:12.173
- Let's swim out
to the sand bar.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.674
- How far out is it?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.576
- It's a swim.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.148
- Don't go too far.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.568
[photo shutter clicking]

01:50.544 --> 01:53.714
- Second floor, far left window.
We got a spotter.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.049
- Spotter on the roof as well.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.220
- There's a spotter on the roof.
Another in the house.

01:59.253 --> 02:02.323
- Roger that. I ain't doing
nothing. Just laying here.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.125
- I'm not seeing a sand bar.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.127
- That's 'cause I made it up.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.399
- Can't hear the music.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.967
Just the ocean.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.570
They should outlaw music
on the beach.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.172
The time for music is later.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.245
I don't want to get
married either.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.247
- Then don't.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.316
- What I want is not
factored into the equation.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.220
Could be worse, I guess.

02:34.454 --> 02:35.689
At least he's kind.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.728
I don't want to get old.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.364
I absolutely dread it.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.570
Let's swim back
before the sharks get us.

02:49.603 --> 02:53.040
- I was thinking the same thing.
I really was.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.075
- I know, that's
why I'm laughing.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.353
- Where's our girls?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.020
- Bedroom.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.589
Said they're seasick.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.190
- I don't give a shit
if they're seasick.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.559
They can be sick on
the fucking sun deck.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.227
Let's go!

03:14.428 --> 03:15.728
- Let's go.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.801
- Think I'm gonna be sick.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.770
- That'll happen when you
drink a bottle of champagne

03:22.803 --> 03:24.505
at eight in the fucking morning.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.039
- What do you want us to do?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.041
- Go lay on the deck.
Take selfies.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.579
And drink some water,
you'll feel better.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.213
- Got any Dramamine?

03:33.247 --> 03:35.516
- Dramamine and alcohol's
a great idea.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.451
- No Dramamine.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.198
[speaking Arabic]

03:57.471 --> 03:59.340
- Well, this is why
they're staying in a house

03:59.373 --> 04:01.509
owned by Qudrah Petrol.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.247
This is Ehsan Al Rashdi.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.550
- That's the fiancÃ©?
- Yeah.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.319
- Who's the beach boy?

04:11.352 --> 04:14.322
- They're brothers.
This is Khamal Al Rashdi.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.290
He's here on a student visa.

04:16.324 --> 04:19.726
Ehsan's here on a work visa.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.262
- A Saudi royal marrying
a Kuwaiti national.

04:25.633 --> 04:26.700
What do you think?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.836
- Beats the fuck out of me.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.705
Never heard of Qudrah Petrol
till last week.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.674
You're the spy,
what do you think?

04:33.707 --> 04:35.743
- I think it makes
no fucking sense.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.578
These marriages are arranged.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.547
Why arrange it with the daughter
of a known terrorist?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.848
- Does it matter?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.584
- The wedding is the place
to get him,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.586
but if the party ends up in
the Emirates or Saudi Arabia,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.655
she is going to be
really difficult to cover.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.726
- How did that thing in
the south go?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.194
- You could have prepared us
a little better

04:54.227 --> 04:56.464
for what that was, boss

04:56.497 --> 04:57.665
- What was it?

04:57.698 --> 04:59.867
- It was a fucking mess
is what it was.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.337
Daytime extraction on
an interstate off-ramp.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.573
- I'm stunned you guys aren't
on fuckin' news.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.775
- This motherfucker
lets off an EMP

05:07.808 --> 05:11.512
and we find ourselves
in a six car pile up.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.280
That was before the
shoot out, mind you.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.717
- The shoot out?
- Mm-hmm.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.723
- Did you miss me?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.493
- Get to a secure line.
- I'm on one.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.227
- I called you on your cell.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.363
Stop acting like it's your
first day on the job.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.399
I'm texting you a number.
- Two minutes.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.342
- KIAs on this op?
- Fuck yeah there were KIAs.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.278
- How many?

05:45.312 --> 05:47.948
- We engaged four,
another three from the wreck.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.817
- Motherfucker.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.953
You're not in Syria,
you asshole, you're in Texas!

05:52.986 --> 05:55.322
- Look, it was a mess
but the op was successful.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.724
State police linking
it to the local cartel.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.291
We're good.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.793
- Have you debriefed?
- Half an hour.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.495
- Call me after.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.764
I swear to God, if any of this
stink gets on my team...

06:03.797 --> 06:05.566
- There's no stink.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.234
Maybe a little bit of
noise, but there's no stink.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.869
- Just call me after!

06:12.573 --> 06:14.642
- I swear...

06:14.675 --> 06:15.776
[grunts]

06:16.844 --> 06:21.248
No good deed.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.216
[music]

07:29.750 --> 07:31.719
- Sorry.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.588
- Look, just keep us out
of a Texas penitentiary,

07:34.622 --> 07:37.057
we're all good.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.659
- I'll give it my best shot.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.293
- That's not encouraging.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.829
[Cruz]
- So, uh, this all we gonna do?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.463
- We're back on line.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.465
- We lay here until
we are too hot,

07:45.499 --> 07:48.001
then we go back in the water,
then back out,

07:48.034 --> 07:49.637
then back in the water.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.572
And then we'll go
to dinner at Moby's,

07:51.605 --> 07:53.641
where we'll make all the boys
jealous at the Surf Lodge.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.075
- Surf Lodge? Ugh.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.076
- Then don't go.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.912
- What's Surf Lodge?

07:58.946 --> 08:01.348
- It's a thousand white boys
trying to get in your pants

08:01.381 --> 08:03.717
and 1500 dizzy blondes
staring death at us.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.052
- They'd rather go to Gurney's

08:05.085 --> 08:06.854
where people
pretend to like you.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.858
Better we go to the dive bar
and we dance on the tables.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.427
You like dancing on tables?

08:14.461 --> 08:15.896
- I feel like I'm spying
on spring break.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.398
- You are.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.000
I'm getting a hangover
just listening to 'em.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.335
- Is there any ice?

08:22.369 --> 08:23.737
This is--

08:25.706 --> 08:27.307
Ow.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.078
- That would be funny if
it wasn't happening to us.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.947
- Take us in before one of
these girls falls overboard.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.448
- Yep.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.586
- Got it.
Whole ice machine back here!

08:38.619 --> 08:41.789
- Imagine that.
- Right?

08:41.822 --> 08:44.758
How do we turn on the music?

08:44.792 --> 08:46.927
- I weep for
this next generation.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.064
We're off the target.
Keep eyes, Bobby.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.465
- Roger that.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.543
Oh, fuck.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.817
- Hey, I'm Kamal.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.019
- Hey, how ya doin'?

09:12.052 --> 09:15.122
Look I'm a lesbian, so none of
that shit's gonna work on me.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.958
- Sure about that?
- Yep.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.427
- You're missing out.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.929
- I'm so sure of that.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.798
- You're posted up too close.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.467
- I'm thirty yards away.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.037
That fucker hunts more
territory than a wolverine.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.575
- Hey, they're packing up.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.447
[music]

09:57.998 --> 09:59.800
- Afternoon.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.901
- Have a seat.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.642
[clears throat]

10:08.676 --> 10:11.144
- You have a contract agent
within the Sinaloa Cartel.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.080
- Yes, that's correct.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.716
- And that contact was
arrested three days ago,

10:15.749 --> 10:18.518
and yesterday he was taken
from police custody by force.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.721
Seven dead on the scene.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.555
Two separate scenes, actually.

10:22.589 --> 10:26.126
- It appears his cartel
launched the assault.

10:26.159 --> 10:29.730
- Multiple witnesses report
vehicles ceasing to function,

10:29.763 --> 10:31.564
cellphones destroyed.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.834
In fact all electronic devices
at the scene were disabled.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.238
- Sounds like an EMP.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.740
- Yeah, it does.

10:41.274 --> 10:46.113
This is surveillance footage
from Border Patrol.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.850
And this footage is from about
two miles down the road.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.022
- Who's that?
Looks a whole lot like you.

10:55.055 --> 10:58.025
- I mean, it is uncanny.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.693
- Oh, fucking stop it!

10:59.727 --> 11:01.528
You put together a team
and you took him!

11:01.561 --> 11:04.597
Congratulations, Kyle, you might
be the first CIA case officer

11:04.631 --> 11:06.099
to make the FBI's
most wanted list.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.234
- Ma'am, if I could--

11:07.267 --> 11:10.838
- Don't fucking "ma'am" me.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.206
Supervisor Meade.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.609
I've earned the title, and
if I haven't I sure as shit

11:16.643 --> 11:18.812
will trying to keep
you out of prison.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.114
- Where'd you get the team?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.552
- I can't divulge that.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.120
- Right.

11:27.154 --> 11:30.724
Do you know anyone with higher
TS clearance than me?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.560
I see things the fucking
president can't see.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.797
Where did you get the team?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.637
- I used the Lioness QRF.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.845
- That will be all.

11:51.879 --> 11:55.582
You chain yourself to your desk
until we figure this out.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.650
- In my defense--
- You have no defense.

11:57.684 --> 11:59.019
- My contract agent
is bringing over

11:59.052 --> 12:01.654
five known Al Qaeda
operatives next week.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.223
If he would have been
transferred to BP,

12:03.256 --> 12:05.658
he would have been killed
by his own cartel.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.828
I lose the five.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.996
I didn't have a fucking choice.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.999
- You have ID on all five?

12:12.032 --> 12:15.068
- Sinaloa is holding them in
a safe house in Chihuahua.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.771
They cross on Sunday to a
safe house in San Antonio.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.007
I got that fucking house
wired and ready.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.209
- You have proof?
- I'll get you proof.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.311
- Get it fast.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.612
- Did you bring the FBI
in on this?

12:25.645 --> 12:27.014
- So they can fuck it up?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.949
- I didn't say let them run it,
you need cover.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.683
- Can't bring them in now.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.685
- I'll talk to DIA, see
what cover we can get.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.254
Dismissed.
Get me the proof.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.329
[door closes]

12:42.362 --> 12:45.032
- You want to talk to
the Governor or the Senators?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.766
- You can take the Senators.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.836
Let's be real careful,

12:48.869 --> 12:50.971
we could pinch this off
and be done with it.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.106
Now we're digging a bigger hole.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.145
- The bigger this becomes
the more justified it appears.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.113
But if there aren't
five Al Qaeda in a house

13:00.147 --> 13:02.315
in Chihuahua, this is
hanging us all in the wind.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.593
[music]

13:20.667 --> 13:22.202
- Tell me these girls
aren't local.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.570
- Westchester.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.737
- Get 'em straight back,
I don't want them

13:24.771 --> 13:26.406
wandering the bars here,

13:26.439 --> 13:27.674
blabbing about the Yacht
they were paid to party on.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.443
- Roger that.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.215
- You didn't want to mention
the gunfight on the border?

you sent us, Joe?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.660
- This is my cell.
- Yep.

13:47.694 --> 13:51.364
- How'd it go?
- Not good.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.432
- How not good?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.204
Did you hang me out?

13:57.237 --> 13:58.405

14:05.645 --> 14:06.813
- Fuck.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.717
- Hey.
- You need to come in.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.352
- I'm on a mark.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.821
- Then I'll come to you.
Send me an address.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.524
- Vicryl suture, please.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.731
- Dr. McNamara, your daughter
has been in a car accident.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.733
She's on her way here now.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.204
- Everything okay?

15:06.673 --> 15:07.740
- Uh, my daughter was
in a car accident.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.476
- How bad?
- I don't know.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.877
Bad enough they're
bringing her here.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.245
- Emily, will you take over?
- Mm-hmm.

[siren blaring]

15:28.996 --> 15:31.231
- Code blue!

15:34.834 --> 15:35.868
- All right, what do we got?

15:35.902 --> 15:37.570
- Non-responsive teenage female,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.039
multiple contusions
to the chest,

15:39.072 --> 15:41.008
looks like her sternum
is fractured. Head trauma.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.875
- ER one.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.877
- Compound fracture.
Systolic at 50.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.315
- Notify OR, on call ortho,
on call cardio.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.283
- My leg!

15:50.317 --> 15:51.818
- Hey, honey.

15:51.851 --> 15:52.919
- Daddy!

15:52.952 --> 15:54.721
- What's presenting?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.023
- Severe pain right thigh,
no movement below the injury,

15:56.056 --> 15:57.390
you can see the swelling.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.359
Severe neck pain,
nausea en route,

15:59.392 --> 16:00.660
looks like a concussion.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.429
- Okay. Look at me.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.064
- What hurts the most?
- My leg!

16:04.097 --> 16:05.498
- Your leg. What about your
head, do you have a headache?

16:05.532 --> 16:07.300
- I don't know!
I don't know!

16:07.334 --> 16:09.902
- HR 126, BP 101 over 52.

16:09.936 --> 16:11.871
- What room?
- 11.

16:11.904 --> 16:16.909
- It's my leg, it hurts!
My leg!

16:16.943 --> 16:17.910
- It's okay, we're here.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.679
- My leg!

16:19.712 --> 16:21.081
- We'll worry about your
leg in a second, honey.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.350
Let's go.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.585
- No, we got it.
We got it, we got it.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.687
- All right, my count.
One, two, three.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.357
[gasps]

16:31.924 --> 16:32.892
- Does she have any
medicinal allergies?

16:32.925 --> 16:34.594
- No.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.096
- Ever had anesthesia?
- No. Neurology been called?

16:36.129 --> 16:37.497
- Where is neurology?
- Coming now.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.565
Hey, Kate, what a crummy
way to see you.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.467
How's she doing, Neal?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.901
- Pain's a nine on right thigh,
can't move below the knee.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.104
- Anybody take pictures?

16:44.137 --> 16:46.339
- 2 liters LR.
- 2 liters running now.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.341
- I'd like to elevate
your leg a little.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.509
I know this is going to hurt.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.843
- [sobbing]
- It's okay.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.945
[screaming]

16:59.919 --> 17:01.254
- I don't see any swelling
except

17:01.288 --> 17:03.456
along the orbital socket,

17:03.490 --> 17:05.325
You see this fracture along C-1.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.526
- And on C-3.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.061
- Looking at the femur here,

17:09.096 --> 17:10.563
there is a complete
oblique fracture

17:10.597 --> 17:12.299
to the distal region
of the femoral shaft.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.201
- You're gonna have to
surgically stabilize that.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.635
- Absolutely.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.237
I'll support it with
an intramedullary nail

17:17.270 --> 17:19.005
insert through
the top of the shaft.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.607
I'd like to get her in
first thing in the morning.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.376
- Let me order a cranial
CT once her BP levels.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.078
- What about the others?

17:25.112 --> 17:28.214
- Prepping one now.
Comminuted open fracture.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.650
That one's not gonna
wait till morning.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.051
The other one didn't make it.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.055
[music]

17:48.501 --> 17:50.103
[phone vibrates]

17:52.105 --> 17:53.106
- Hey.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.009
- Kate was in a car accident.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.550
- How bad?

18:03.583 --> 18:07.154
- She broke her femur,
fractured some vertebrae.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.189
She was in shock,
but she's stable now.

18:09.222 --> 18:13.426
She's awake but
she's pretty shook up.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.262
One of the kids
didn't make it.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.133
She's going into surgery
in the morning.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.168
Where are you?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.969
- I'm in New York.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.375
Not that it matters,
what happened?

18:28.408 --> 18:31.711
- I don't know.
I don't have any specifics.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.081
Surgery's at 7:00.
It should be about three hours.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.583
Two hours in recovery.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.285
Can you make it by noon?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.021
- I'll find a way.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.125
RHC?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.027
- Yeah.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.362
- Where's Charlie?

18:49.396 --> 18:51.698
- Charlie's at the neighbors.

18:51.731 --> 18:55.468
- Should I...
Should I call her?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.670
- No, just let her rest.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.407
I haven't delivered
all the news yet.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.074
Are you gonna be reachable?

19:02.108 --> 19:04.211
- Not really.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.145
I'm on one, ya know?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.182
- Okay.

19:09.216 --> 19:12.051
I won't tell her you're coming
in case you can't peel away.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.488
- I'm coming.

19:15.522 --> 19:19.492
- Okay. We'll see you tomorrow.

19:24.397 --> 19:25.732
- Neal.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.471
Blood work's back.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.007
Buddy, she's pregnant.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.380
Now, you know that
traumatic injury

19:40.413 --> 19:42.815
during the first trimester
creates a severe risk

19:42.849 --> 19:46.253
of fetal injury,
as does the anesthesia.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.656
I assume it's unplanned,

19:49.689 --> 19:54.060
so her aborting probably not
the worst thing.

19:56.095 --> 19:59.699
- She's fucking 14 years old.
- I know.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.134
- It's early enough
we can prescribe her

20:02.168 --> 20:04.837
Mifepristone and Misoprostol.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.241
I'd prefer to do the surgery
first and then prescribe it.

20:08.275 --> 20:11.110
- Yeah, me, too.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.245
- That's what we'll do.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.048

20:30.129 --> 20:31.564

20:31.598 --> 20:33.132

clothes off, honey.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.736
- I lost my phone.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.305
Don't know what happened
to everyone else.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.072
- You just worry about
yourself for now, okay?

20:45.478 --> 20:46.546
- Do you know?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.382
- I know some.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.284
I know two of the girls went
to a different hospital.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.353
I can find out, but honey.
Don't expect good news.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.690
- What do you know?

20:59.859 --> 21:02.629
- What did I say were the
two things that have the most

21:02.662 --> 21:04.597
likelihood of altering
the course of your life?

21:06.866 --> 21:08.635
- Cars and sex.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.303
- And they both did.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.238
- I wasn't driving.
- I'm not accusing you.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.206
I don't know what happened.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.577
I don't know whose fault it is,

21:17.610 --> 21:20.212
but I do know that cars kill
more teenagers

21:20.246 --> 21:22.749
than any other cause combined.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.552
And it almost killed you, honey.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.457
- Did it kill anybody?

21:31.624 --> 21:32.859
- It did.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.129
- Who?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.198
- Holly.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.738
[cries]

21:48.475 --> 21:50.443
- Who else?

21:50.477 --> 21:53.312
- I don't know.
I'll find out.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.218
I wish I could give
you more time to process that,

21:59.251 --> 22:01.354
but we don't have that today.

22:01.388 --> 22:02.855
So are you ready
for the next one?

22:04.924 --> 22:06.225
- Next one what?

22:08.828 --> 22:11.297
- You broke our deal.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.632
- What deal?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.702
- With boys.
You broke our deal.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.336
You're pregnant.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.538
- What?

22:19.906 --> 22:20.940
No, that's not...

22:20.973 --> 22:22.409
- That's not possible?

22:24.911 --> 22:27.714
Are you gonna look me in the eye
and lie to me?

22:27.747 --> 22:30.517
I have your blood work
and urinalysis, honey.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.385
You're going into
surgery tomorrow.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.754
We test for these things, okay?

22:34.787 --> 22:37.890
Now it's very likely that the
trauma you've experienced

22:37.924 --> 22:40.993
terminated the pregnancy.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.997
And if it didn't, it's quite
likely that the anesthesia

22:45.031 --> 22:48.768
would terminate the pregnancy.

22:48.801 --> 22:53.906
But if somehow the fetus
survives all of this...

22:53.940 --> 22:56.943
you're gonna have a very,
very big decision to make.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.680
- This is-- this is--

23:00.713 --> 23:01.681
- Too much to handle?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.450
- Yes.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.886
- That's why you don't
have sex at fourteen.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.822
And that's why your mother
and I forbid you

23:09.856 --> 23:12.659
from driving in a car
with a teenage driver.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.263
And it breaks my heart that
this is the way

23:17.296 --> 23:19.231
you need to learn
these lessons.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.337
- I'm sorry.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.374
- No, you don't
apologize to me.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.476
You forgive yourself.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.713
Now at least you can learn
consequences of actions

23:33.746 --> 23:35.548
while still benefitting
from the lesson.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.550

26:58.484 --> 27:00.019
-[chuckling]
-That's true.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.661
- You're not gonna work.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.034
- Hell, no.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.408
- Fine, I'll go.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.312
- I'll be in touch.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.227
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.029
- My group is in there.
- Name?

27:43.062 --> 27:45.031
- Al Rashdi.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.233
- Thank you.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.036
- What the fuck, you let her in?

27:50.069 --> 27:52.038
- Look at her then look at you.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.724
- That's our cue.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.461
- YOLO.

28:15.494 --> 28:18.197
Are you coming?
- I'm coming.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.365
- What a surprise.

28:25.738 --> 28:28.107
- Something to drink?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.076
- Light beer.
In a bottle.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.543
- No glass?
- No glass.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.079
- Okay.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.623
- You a model?

28:44.656 --> 28:46.125
- Yeah.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.127
- You look like one.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.696
You here alone?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.431
- I'm with my husband.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.600
- Yeah, what's he do?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.435
- He plays
professional football.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.273
You're in his spot.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.276
That wouldn't be good for you.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.112
- 'Nuff said.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.682
[phone vibrates]

29:14.921 --> 29:17.256
- How is she?
[Neal] The same.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.826
Look, you and me got a deal.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.862
We don't lie to each other
and we don't keep secrets.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.364
- No, we don't.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.665
- Kate's pregnant.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.171
[music]

29:36.208 --> 29:39.278
- Guess the pants
didn't stay on after all.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.479
- No.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.314
- Goddammit.

29:42.348 --> 29:47.219
- Look, this is... This is
too big to be mad about.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.221
- Yeah.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.225
We're sacrificing
our children,

29:53.259 --> 29:54.493
that's what we're doing.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.262
We're trading them
for professions.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.629
- I don't disagree.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.531
Look, all I have
is problems today.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.300
I don't have any solutions.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.236
But we should seek some.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.272
- Agreed.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.842
- Just be here tomorrow.
- I will.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.178
- She needs it.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.545
- I need it, too.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.189
- Bottle of water?

30:23.222 --> 30:27.559
- We used to say I love you,
a lot.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.365
Maybe we should go back
to doing that.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.970
- Yeah.
We should do that more.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.838
- I'll think on solutions.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.642
- There's no easy ones.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.913
- Never are.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.492
- You a model?

31:02.728 --> 31:04.730
- I'm a student.

31:04.763 --> 31:06.332
- You look like a model.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.871
It's just an observation.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.507
I'm here with a friend
from work, and...

31:15.541 --> 31:18.510
I don't know a soul here.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.646
People who look like you

31:20.679 --> 31:23.449
typically make a living from it.
I was just making conversation.

31:26.986 --> 31:30.389
- You the designated driver?

31:30.422 --> 31:32.959
- No, it's just hot
on the dance floor.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.864
You wanna dance?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.766
- Heck, yeah I want to dance.

31:40.799 --> 31:42.268
- Heck yeah you wanna dance?

31:42.301 --> 31:44.570
- Hell yes.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.538
Fuck yes.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.906
What do you want me to say?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.875
- Come on.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.710
- What the fuck is she doing?

32:02.688 --> 32:05.557
- This is boring
the fuck out of me.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.293
- Mission focus, Tex.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.961
- I'm focused, I'm just saying.

32:10.362 --> 32:11.663
- Hey. Hey, hey hey.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.265
[music]

32:23.909 --> 32:25.444
- Where is she?

32:25.477 --> 32:27.313
- She's on the mark.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.448
- Can you pull and replace?

32:29.481 --> 32:31.817
- Not here.
- I'll stay close.

32:31.850 --> 32:32.918
Have her reach out
when she can.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.357
- Fuck was that about?

32:39.658 --> 32:41.493
- That was about us.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.663
[music]

32:45.998 --> 32:47.599
- Two Solento Sandias.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.634
- What's that?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.669
- Watermelon juice and vodka.

33:25.937 --> 33:26.972
- Hey!

33:27.005 --> 33:29.508
- Fuck you.
- Asshole.

33:30.509 --> 33:31.643
Ah!

33:31.677 --> 33:34.012
[shrieks]

33:34.046 --> 33:35.814
- You wanna go?

33:35.847 --> 33:36.948
- Come on!

33:48.927 --> 33:50.129
[echoing]
- You okay?

33:55.901 --> 33:58.737
Let's get you out of here.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.846
- Cruz...

34:07.879 --> 34:09.581
Fuck.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.884
Shit.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.088
She's been snatched.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.724
White male, pale blue shirt,
tan pants.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.592
They're exiting the
north side of club.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.494
- Let's go.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.830
What the hell, man?
Come on!

34:32.638 --> 34:34.072
- Zara!

34:34.106 --> 34:35.607
Zara's still inside!

34:35.641 --> 34:37.208
- We will come back for her.
Call her from the car.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.313
[music]

34:45.384 --> 34:47.518
- Randy, do you see her?

34:47.553 --> 34:49.455
- Yeah, she's moving north.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.623
She's outside the hotel.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.441
- She stopped moving.
In the trees.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.075
Four hundred meters north east.

35:44.109 --> 35:47.045
- In the trees,
two hundred meters, your 12:00.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.291
- You're so fucking hot.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.199
[grunts]

36:08.200 --> 36:09.235
- Fucker.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.302
Come here.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.670
[grunting]

36:16.542 --> 36:18.210
- Aw, fuck.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.279
- Okay, all right.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.480
- What do you got,
what do you got?

36:21.513 --> 36:23.081
- Heart rate 44.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.552
[grunts]

36:30.689 --> 36:32.524
- We're looking,
we're looking, we're looking.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.627
- 38, okay, I got something
here to wake us up.

36:35.661 --> 36:38.230
Here we go.
Oh, yeah.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.568
Okay.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.470
- What the fuck?
What the fuck?

36:47.673 --> 36:49.508
- Okay.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.710
- Look at me.
Look at me.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.479
All right, now, yeah.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.247
- Get her back to the house.
Now.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.215
- Yes, ma'am.

37:03.822 --> 37:04.856
[grunts]

37:04.890 --> 37:06.525
- Oh, fuck!

37:09.328 --> 37:10.696
- Stretch him out.

37:17.669 --> 37:21.640
[screams]

37:21.673 --> 37:25.277
- This is what we did
to rapists in Afghanistan.

37:25.311 --> 37:29.415
It was highly effective
at stopping habitual offenders,

37:29.448 --> 37:33.552
of which you clearly are.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.463
- When you try to explain
this at the hospital,

37:44.496 --> 37:48.467
I highly recommend you tell them
you never saw your attackers.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.306
Because if you tell
them anything...

37:54.340 --> 37:56.308
we'll fucking kill you.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.481
Get me DNA samples.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.251
[screams]

38:09.921 --> 38:12.824
- Cruz, relax. Relax.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.926
Relax.
Hey, Cruz, relax.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.195
- It was too soon for this.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.764
- We're in it now.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.231
- You don't have the skills
for clandestine work.

38:21.700 --> 38:25.337
- I can. I'll learn.

38:25.371 --> 38:27.339
- There's bogeys, bandits,
and marks in this world.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.574
And nothing else.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.646
- They don't trust me.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.314
I was trying to fit in.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.450
- If she can't manage
a weekend in New York,

38:38.484 --> 38:40.452
how is she going to navigate
Riyadh or Damascus?

38:40.486 --> 38:42.253
[phone buzzing]

38:45.824 --> 38:47.292
- Get her water.

38:49.495 --> 38:50.996
- We've never had anyone
this close

38:51.029 --> 38:52.664
to a tier one target before.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.232
She's in.

38:54.265 --> 38:55.834
I'll get her there.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.269
What choice do we have?

38:58.303 --> 39:00.672
- The wedding's in Dubai.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.809
That's where she wants it.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.944
And she gets what she wants.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.279
- We can cover her there.

39:08.313 --> 39:09.815
- If you can make it that long.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.849
- I can make it.

39:12.484 --> 39:14.285
- I need to talk to you
about something else.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.788
- My daughter was
in an accident.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.624
Surgery's in the morning.

39:18.657 --> 39:19.958
Can we talk on the way there?

39:19.991 --> 39:21.393
- Yeah, we can talk on the way.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.477
- Thought you wanted to talk.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.412
- We will.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.880
Tell me about the accident.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.315
- I don't know.
'Cause I wasn't there.

39:44.349 --> 39:45.617
I'm fucking here.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.352
- Don't do that to yourself.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.688
-No? Then else who do I blame?

39:49.721 --> 39:50.922
If not me?

39:57.596 --> 40:00.398
- I don't know how you and
Errol did it. I really don't.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.468
- What did we do?
- Stayed together.

40:03.469 --> 40:04.670
Raised a family.

40:16.548 --> 40:20.952
You're here to talk Texas, so...
Let's talk Texas.

40:20.986 --> 40:24.756
- Your team is on Border Patrol
surveillance footage

40:24.790 --> 40:28.660
performing a hot extraction
with multiple casualties.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.465
