03:21.642 --> 03:23.375
I just can't understand
why you put the shirt on.

03:23.377 --> 03:25.276
- Dude, let it go.
- I don't get it.

03:25.278 --> 03:27.044
No, it's, I'm not angry anymore

03:27.046 --> 03:28.045
I just wanna understand
your thought process.

03:28.047 --> 03:29.481
Why does my shirt matter?

03:29.483 --> 03:31.783
You wanna show you care, you
wanna show you're committed.

03:31.785 --> 03:33.285
I am not trying
to date these guys.

03:33.287 --> 03:35.021
Yes, you are!
That's the whole thing!

03:35.023 --> 03:36.923
Well, actually,
maybe it's smart, you know?

03:36.925 --> 03:38.758
It'll seem like
he's playing it cool or, ah..

03:38.760 --> 03:40.893
Yeah, or playing it like a moron
is what he's gonna..

03:40.895 --> 03:43.228
Sorry about that.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.464
See, that's the kind
of friend I would date.

03:47.235 --> 03:49.100
Alright, I'm gonna take
the lead, you're gonna take..

03:49.102 --> 03:50.369
- You're gonna take the lead.
- I'm going with him.

03:50.371 --> 03:51.637
- 'Cause you're better looking.
- Do I tuck my shirt in?

03:51.639 --> 03:52.638
I don't care,
you look like you're gonna

03:52.640 --> 03:53.873
fix the computer anyway.
Let's go!

03:53.875 --> 03:56.108
That's a fucking
shitty thing to.. Okay.

04:04.185 --> 04:05.752
Andrew!

04:05.754 --> 04:08.021
Oh! How you doin', big dog?

04:08.023 --> 04:09.325
Big dog!

04:10.225 --> 04:11.758
How you doin'?

04:11.760 --> 04:14.028
We're here to rush, we're here.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.830
Bids went out yesterday.

04:15.832 --> 04:17.630
Bids don't go out
till the end of rush week.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.567
Yeah, uh, but ours do.

04:20.569 --> 04:21.769
Hey, thanks for having me, man.

04:21.771 --> 04:23.305
- Yeah, man. Yeah.
- Appreciate it.

04:27.209 --> 04:29.644
Um, well, that's fine.

04:29.646 --> 04:31.080
We are very flexible.

04:31.082 --> 04:32.146
We've got a lot of
free time on our hands.

04:32.148 --> 04:33.681
You let us know, and we can

04:33.683 --> 04:35.483
we can be back here
anytime you want.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.385
So, you got, you know,
you've got my Facebook

04:37.387 --> 04:41.255
and you stay, uh,
you stay fresh.

04:41.257 --> 04:44.294
And, uh, I want you
to stay fresh.

04:47.498 --> 04:48.666
Thank... thanks for your time.

04:54.138 --> 04:55.304
Day drink time.

04:55.306 --> 04:57.073
Day drink boys!

04:57.075 --> 04:58.910
Yeah, day drink.

05:03.147 --> 05:05.615
They said... they said
2 o'clock, so I don't..

05:05.617 --> 05:08.685
- A.m. or p.m.?
- Oh, hi!

05:08.687 --> 05:10.186
How you doin'?

05:10.188 --> 05:11.388
<i>Hi!</i>

05:11.390 --> 05:13.390
Oh, oh,
just could I get one second?

05:13.392 --> 05:15.926
Could I have one... one...
one quick second, please?

05:15.928 --> 05:18.395
Um, we... we were invited
to the day drink

05:18.397 --> 05:21.966
and I'm noticing
it's not a lot.. No one's here.

05:21.968 --> 05:24.234
- You missed it.
- Missed it.

05:24.236 --> 05:27.605
<i>Okay, well, um, is anyone home,
is anyone inside?</i>

05:27.607 --> 05:29.040
Maybe we could hang out?

05:29.042 --> 05:30.675
- No.
- No, it's not...

05:30.677 --> 05:34.679
Um, what's your name,
by the way?

05:34.681 --> 05:36.681
- Got to be kidding me.
- Nailed it, okay.

05:36.683 --> 05:37.949
Moving on, guys.

05:37.951 --> 05:39.084
<i>We're moving on.</i>

05:39.086 --> 05:40.584
<i>Roll out.</i>

05:40.586 --> 05:42.188
That sucked.

05:44.357 --> 05:46.758
I shouldn't date
non-Jews anyways, so it's..

05:59.473 --> 06:00.873
<i>Fuck Kappa.</i>

06:00.875 --> 06:02.476
Oh, yeah, fuck Kappa.

06:03.945 --> 06:04.879
Hi!

06:05.780 --> 06:07.680
Hey, hi.

06:07.682 --> 06:09.082
<i>Hi.</i>

06:09.084 --> 06:10.316
<i>Uh..</i>

06:10.318 --> 06:12.186
Hey, wh... what are you guys
doing tonight?

06:12.188 --> 06:15.922
Oh, we're headed to,
um, to, to Beta Chi.

06:15.924 --> 06:17.657
That's a shame. Hold this.

06:17.659 --> 06:21.461
When you get bored,
you guys should come by.

06:21.463 --> 06:23.429
<i>Yeah, I, uh, definitely.</i>

06:23.431 --> 06:25.165
I... I'd like that.
We'd like that.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.801
- You're all friends, right?
- <i>We're close, we're tight.</i>

06:27.803 --> 06:28.902
We're best friends.

06:28.904 --> 06:31.371
Good, well,
this is good for three.

06:31.373 --> 06:33.208
- That's convenient.
- <i>You guys better make it!</i>

06:33.210 --> 06:34.942
Well, we're gonna try to..

06:34.944 --> 06:36.978
We're gonna try
to make that happen.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.479
- Promise?
- <i>I promise.</i>

06:38.481 --> 06:40.483
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

06:44.087 --> 06:45.220
Oh, my God.

06:46.490 --> 06:47.789
I would swallow her underwear.

06:47.791 --> 06:50.225
Alright, after Beta Chi,
we're going to that party, okay?

06:50.227 --> 06:51.326
- Definitely.
- Deal.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.527
- Alright, Beta Chi time.
- Let's go.

06:52.529 --> 06:53.561
Beta Chi time.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.436
Alright, guys,
act natural, okay?

07:01.438 --> 07:02.504
Stop saying "Act natural."

07:02.506 --> 07:03.873
What does that mean,
"Act natural"?

07:03.875 --> 07:04.976
<i>Derek!</i>

07:06.177 --> 07:08.978
Derek! Derek,
there you are, you bitch.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.846
How you doin'?

07:10.848 --> 07:12.581
- Do I know you?
- Yeah. I am, uh..

07:12.583 --> 07:16.019
Ah, you remember we met, uh..
You're the admin for the group.

07:16.021 --> 07:18.255
You're on the group,
the rush group?

07:18.257 --> 07:19.388
I'm David.

07:22.293 --> 07:23.896
What's good with you?

07:25.329 --> 07:27.230
Hey, guys.
Ah, you guys rushing?

07:27.232 --> 07:29.032
No, no, we're just,
we're just checking it out.

07:29.034 --> 07:31.168
You guys, um, hear anything
about the pledging?

07:31.170 --> 07:34.272
Uh, no, no. We didn't...
We didn't hear anything.

07:34.274 --> 07:36.473
You know, I doubt they're gonna
let anybody haze anyway

07:36.475 --> 07:37.942
after last year.

07:37.944 --> 07:40.144
I just heard it was
gonna be like a lot of drinking

07:40.146 --> 07:41.979
maybe some weird naked shit.

07:41.981 --> 07:44.148
Uh, sorry,
what weird naked shit?

07:44.150 --> 07:45.950
I'm up for anything.

07:45.952 --> 07:47.652
Is that like your thing?

07:47.654 --> 07:51.290
- Weird naked shit?
- No. What?

07:52.725 --> 07:54.592
Do you... do you... do you..

07:58.665 --> 08:00.232
What about, what about Kristen?

08:00.234 --> 08:01.834
<i>I had her good last night, man.</i>

08:01.836 --> 08:03.601
- No way!
- <i>Yeah.</i>

08:03.603 --> 08:05.403
Oh, how'd you meet her?

08:05.405 --> 08:06.738
Wh... where'd you meet her?

08:06.740 --> 08:08.140
Did you meet her here?

08:08.142 --> 08:10.442
I'm not saying
I wouldn't be into naked..

08:10.444 --> 08:12.344
Listen to a conversation
for once in your life.

08:12.346 --> 08:14.046
- Alright, take it down a notch.
- <i>Are you kidding me right now?</i>

08:14.048 --> 08:15.649
Nice meeting you guys,
I'm gonna go.

08:16.750 --> 08:17.950
Yo, it's alright, man.

08:17.952 --> 08:19.085
- That's awesome.
- Cool, man.

08:19.087 --> 08:20.086
Y'all, I'll catch you guys
a lil' later.

08:20.088 --> 08:21.087
I'm gonna get a drink.

08:21.089 --> 08:22.956
You got drinks in the back?

08:22.958 --> 08:24.592
Yeah, alright,
I'm gonna get a drink.

08:27.128 --> 08:30.196
- Hey, how are things going?
- I'm being very natural.

08:30.198 --> 08:33.366
- Okay, alright.
- Very, very poorly.

08:33.368 --> 08:35.969
Ah, yeah, I'm kinda
having that problem too.

08:35.971 --> 08:37.804
I don't know, my jokes,
they're not landing.

08:37.806 --> 08:40.142
- Wow, shocker.
- Hey, Daniel.

08:41.344 --> 08:42.442
It's David.

08:42.443 --> 08:46.280
Yeah, um, this is a closed
rush party, man.

08:46.282 --> 08:49.350
Okay, if we did
something wrong

08:49.352 --> 08:50.818
we'd love
constructive criticism.

08:50.820 --> 08:52.253
Please just tell us,
we wanna know.

08:52.255 --> 08:53.654
Please don't tell us,
I don't wanna know.

08:53.656 --> 08:55.223
I'd like to, we'd like to.

08:55.225 --> 08:58.093
You're just not the right..
You guys are weird.

08:58.095 --> 08:59.860
- We're weird?
- Yes.

08:59.862 --> 09:00.896
- We're weird?
- Yes.

09:00.898 --> 09:02.030
Well, that's..
We're weird?

09:02.032 --> 09:03.331
- <i>Yes.</i>
- We're weird?

09:03.333 --> 09:04.498
The sixth time and still...

09:04.500 --> 09:05.633
He's weird?
You're saying he's weird?

09:05.635 --> 09:07.135
I'm getting sick
of this, let's go.

09:07.137 --> 09:08.303
Let's give 'em the beer,
get 'em the hell out of here.

09:08.305 --> 09:09.504
I don't want your fucking beer.

09:09.506 --> 09:10.972
David, just take the beer..

09:10.974 --> 09:12.274
- It's okay.
- <i>You're gonna regret this.</i>

09:12.276 --> 09:13.775
- Get outta here.
- <i>Big time, big time.</i>

09:13.777 --> 09:14.976
<i>Thank you for your hospitality.</i>

09:14.978 --> 09:17.146
Fuck Beta,
let's go to that other part..

09:17.148 --> 09:18.980
What is that?
What, are you mad at me?

09:18.982 --> 09:20.815
Oh, no, I love being humiliated!

09:20.817 --> 09:23.185
Oh, my God.
Look, I threw a Hail Mary!

09:23.187 --> 09:24.586
I took a big risk, you know

09:24.588 --> 09:25.888
<i>and I wanted
to make it happen for us.</i>

09:25.890 --> 09:27.522
<i>I don't think that's so bad.</i>

09:27.524 --> 09:28.724
<i>Can we just go
to this girl's party</i>

09:28.726 --> 09:30.192
and forget about that frat?

09:30.194 --> 09:32.261
- It's so not worth it.
- There is no party, man!

09:32.263 --> 09:33.596
It's clearly a prank.

09:33.598 --> 09:35.665
Alright, fine,
a prank by her would be amazing.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.267
I would love to be pranked
by a girl like that.

09:37.269 --> 09:40.170
Look, let's just,
let's go back to the dorm

09:40.172 --> 09:41.504
we'll get drunk, alright?

09:41.506 --> 09:43.173
Obviously, this night's
not working out.

09:43.175 --> 09:45.142
- Thank you.
- <i>But that's not..</i>

09:45.144 --> 09:46.442
It's not just tonight.

09:46.444 --> 09:49.079
If we go home and we,
and we just give up

09:49.081 --> 09:50.547
that's the next four years.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.816
That's just us drinking
and playing Xbox

09:52.818 --> 09:54.184
and doing nothing
for the rest of college.

09:54.186 --> 09:55.519
That doesn't sound bad.

09:55.521 --> 09:57.355
That sounds way better
than someone making fun of me

09:57.357 --> 09:59.923
every time I walk
through their door.

10:01.593 --> 10:03.261
David, I can't even
get this address anymore.

10:03.263 --> 10:04.762
I mean, can you read that?
What do you want me to...

10:04.764 --> 10:06.764
I know the address, so don't
worry about the address.

10:06.766 --> 10:08.199
I got that in my head.

10:08.201 --> 10:09.834
It says nothing, I mean, what
if we can't find this place?

10:09.836 --> 10:12.503
If we can't find the place,
I will call a cab immediately.

10:12.505 --> 10:14.706
Right away, okay?

10:14.708 --> 10:15.873
You'll pay for the cab?

10:15.875 --> 10:17.709
Of course, I'll pay for the cab.

10:17.711 --> 10:19.144
You'll get me an egg cream
on the way home?

10:19.146 --> 10:20.678
I was gonna buy you
an egg cream no matter what.

10:20.680 --> 10:21.813
- <i>Can we go?</i>
- Yeah, fine.

10:21.815 --> 10:23.015
- Alright. Yeah.
- I'm in.

10:23.017 --> 10:24.783
- Thank you.
- Okay, last chance, man.

10:24.785 --> 10:26.519
Yes, that's all I'm asking for.

10:42.204 --> 10:45.374
Alright, guys, I think, uh..

10:46.875 --> 10:48.810
This is, um, this is it.

10:50.912 --> 10:51.847
What is this?

10:52.748 --> 10:53.913
It's a driveway.

10:53.915 --> 10:56.116
- With grass?
- Yeah, with grass. Come on.

10:56.118 --> 10:58.486
Guys, this is just a prank,
I'm going to sit down.

10:58.488 --> 11:00.054
No, do not sit down.

11:00.056 --> 11:02.622
It is impossible to get you up
when you sit down, let's go.

11:02.624 --> 11:03.893
Would you pl..

11:04.760 --> 11:06.062
Oh, goddamnit.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.089
Ow!

12:05.291 --> 12:07.460
Ow! Fucking ticks.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.294
D-David?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.433
Oh, my God,
does that look like a prank?

12:15.435 --> 12:16.867
That's the best prank
in the world.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.870
- Uh, yeah.
- Come on, let's go. Come on.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.511
- It's amazing!
- Hey, hey, that. Look at that.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.647
- She's really cute!
- Yeah.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.649
Oh, man!

12:31.651 --> 12:33.118
- I would love to meet her.
- Yeah, this is good.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.853
I think this is
the best I'll do, you know?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.020
Well, give yourself
some credit.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.622
You know, they're kinda,
like, better from afar

12:37.624 --> 12:39.023
so we don't mess it up.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.426
That's what
I'm saying exactly, yeah.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.428
When you get close
and then you disappoint

12:42.430 --> 12:44.597
and you have to talk and you
have to like impress them.

12:44.599 --> 12:46.031
Is it weird that I'm aroused?

12:46.033 --> 12:47.433
I'm also very sweaty, I think...

12:47.435 --> 12:48.501
- <i>Hey, guys!</i>
- Oh!

12:48.503 --> 12:49.835
- Hey.
- <i>Whoa!</i>

12:49.837 --> 12:53.540
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to spook ya.

12:53.542 --> 12:56.775
Yeah, so... sorry, we thought
it was an a... abandoned house.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.381
No. No, not quite.

13:00.415 --> 13:01.350
Okay.

13:03.051 --> 13:04.186
You wanna join us?

13:05.521 --> 13:07.220
- Yeah!
- Yes, yes, definitely.

13:07.222 --> 13:08.221
- Yeah.
- Definitely, yes.

13:08.223 --> 13:09.356
<i>I think that'll be really good.</i>

13:09.358 --> 13:10.790
We, we're not doing,
I think we're free.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.259
Thank you, sir,
bless your heart.

13:12.261 --> 13:13.528
You're a really good guy,
I won't let you down.

13:13.530 --> 13:15.729
- I'm Ricky, by the way.
- I'm Ethan, thank you.

13:15.731 --> 13:18.299
- I'm Justin.
- Great.

13:18.301 --> 13:19.766
- I, ah..
- Great, here.

13:19.768 --> 13:21.602
- Oh! Take that.
- Okay.

13:21.604 --> 13:23.538
- Just picked up.
- Oh, these are heavy!

13:27.210 --> 13:29.510
It's at least like,
200 years old.

13:29.512 --> 13:32.713
- That's right.
- Yeah.

13:32.715 --> 13:33.814
Let yourselves in.

13:33.816 --> 13:34.751
Yeah.

13:36.587 --> 13:39.390
Oh, merlot.
I'm big, I'm big on merlot.

13:58.309 --> 14:00.142
Gentlemen!

14:00.144 --> 14:03.845
- Meet Maxwell Peterson III.
- Oh, call me Max.

14:03.847 --> 14:05.014
What's your name?

14:05.016 --> 14:06.950
- Ethan.
- Nice to meet you.

14:06.952 --> 14:08.851
- Justin.
- Nice to meet you, Justin!

14:08.853 --> 14:10.186
- <i>What about you, man?</i>
- <i>I'm David.</i>

14:10.188 --> 14:12.055
- Nice to meet you.
- And I'm just like..

14:12.057 --> 14:14.692
New England Colonial,
it's like, come on.

14:14.694 --> 14:16.194
<i>It's just.. Yeah.</i>

14:20.366 --> 14:22.233
So... so do you guys
live here or, uh..

14:22.235 --> 14:25.935
Yeah. I mean, it's a long
drive to class, but..

14:25.937 --> 14:27.438
Oh, sorry.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.374
<i>Totally fucking worth it.</i>

14:30.376 --> 14:32.176
What he said.

14:32.178 --> 14:34.478
So, uh, can I get you guys
a drink or anything?

14:34.480 --> 14:37.781
- I would like to hang out, yes.
- Excellent. You two with me?

14:37.783 --> 14:39.584
- Alright, you're with me.
- <i>Let's do it.</i>

14:39.586 --> 14:41.187
- Let's do it to it.
- Oh.

14:42.154 --> 14:44.124
Do anyone of you like Scotch?

14:46.159 --> 14:48.426
Oh! Oh, man.

14:48.428 --> 14:50.562
What is that, liquid brick?

14:50.564 --> 14:51.663
How's rush week going, man?

14:51.665 --> 14:53.598
- Yeah, it's, you know.
- Huh?

14:53.600 --> 14:55.300
It's kind of a,
a little bit of a mixed bag

14:55.302 --> 14:58.003
but, you, what year are you?

14:58.005 --> 14:59.405
- I'm a senior.
- Oh..

14:59.407 --> 15:01.340
You look like a senior.

15:01.342 --> 15:02.277
Yeah.

15:10.418 --> 15:11.517
Whoa.

15:16.491 --> 15:18.257
Wh... what,
what frat is this again?

15:18.259 --> 15:19.728
Say hello to Bret.

15:20.529 --> 15:21.827
Uh, hello, Bret.

15:21.829 --> 15:25.198
No, I'm good, I had a beer at..
Okay, sure. Uh..

15:25.200 --> 15:28.834
- Uh, cheers.
- Mm, the good stuff.

15:28.836 --> 15:31.538
- Oh, no, thanks.
- You don't want any?

15:31.540 --> 15:33.240
- No, I'm good.
- That's premium vodka.

15:33.242 --> 15:34.642
I don't drink.

15:34.644 --> 15:36.512
Well, that's pretty
fucking rude.

15:38.648 --> 15:39.714
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

15:41.016 --> 15:42.283
Come on, guys,
we've got more people to meet.

15:42.285 --> 15:43.720
Chill, man, it's cool.

15:50.560 --> 15:51.559
Wow!

15:53.530 --> 15:54.629
Oh, yeah, oh.

15:54.631 --> 15:56.264
<i>Are you gonna go talk to 'em?</i>

15:56.266 --> 15:58.734
Yeah, I just, uh, I'm gonna
do a little strategizing

15:58.736 --> 16:00.369
and I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get over there.

16:00.371 --> 16:02.638
Ben, man, sup?

16:02.640 --> 16:03.672
- How's it goin', man?
- Yeah.

16:03.674 --> 16:04.673
Did you guys meet David yet?

16:04.675 --> 16:06.208
No, hey.

16:06.210 --> 16:09.180
David was just telling us
about his, um, his strategy.

16:11.182 --> 16:12.314
Oh, yeah?

16:12.316 --> 16:13.982
I mean, it's..
Wheels are turning.

16:13.984 --> 16:15.084
Come on, man,
I'll introduce you!

16:15.086 --> 16:16.085
No, that's okay,
you've gotta...

16:16.087 --> 16:17.086
<i>Come on.</i>

16:17.088 --> 16:18.087
There's a method to my madness.

16:18.089 --> 16:19.088
<i>I'll do it. I'll..</i>

16:19.090 --> 16:21.156
You could introduce me, I'll...

16:21.158 --> 16:22.625
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

16:22.627 --> 16:26.665
Ladies, please,
meet Sam, Ben, David.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.400
Hi.

16:30.402 --> 16:31.901
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.537
- I'm Stacey.
- How's it going?

16:34.539 --> 16:37.040
You look like
my little brother.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.141
Thank you.

16:38.143 --> 16:40.444
Th... thank you for saying that.

16:40.446 --> 16:42.212
- Anybody wanna do a shot?
- Shots?

16:42.214 --> 16:43.246
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:43.248 --> 16:44.715
- Yeah.
- Yes, please.

16:44.717 --> 16:47.084
- <i>I'll do shots.</i>
- Shots are my middle name.

16:47.086 --> 16:48.252
Anyone want a special shot?

16:48.254 --> 16:50.121
I'll.. I'd like, I'd like that.

16:50.123 --> 16:51.756
- Yeah? You?
- I'd like that.

16:51.758 --> 16:53.357
What's a special shot?

16:53.359 --> 16:55.159
- <i>That's a special shot.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

16:56.162 --> 16:57.294
<i>Pleasure's all you, bro.</i>

16:57.296 --> 16:59.463
How many special shots
are we doing here?

16:59.465 --> 17:01.633
<i>Um, o... okay.</i>

17:01.635 --> 17:03.568
See, I didn't realize that,
Stacey, you were not specific

17:03.570 --> 17:04.569
'cause if he's doing...

17:04.570 --> 17:05.871
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

17:05.873 --> 17:07.772
Cheers! Are we doing
another special shot?

17:07.775 --> 17:08.773
Or is that the last...

17:08.776 --> 17:11.175
<i>Drink your fucking shot, David.</i>

17:11.178 --> 17:12.676
<i>Oh!</i>

17:12.679 --> 17:14.012
- Ooh!
- <i>Whew!</i>

17:14.013 --> 17:15.946
- Whoo! Yeah.
- <i>Alright, come on, boys.</i>

17:15.949 --> 17:18.049
- There's more party to be had.
- Okay.

17:18.050 --> 17:19.317
- <i>Alright!</i>
- You're welcome.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.619
- <i>I'll see you later, right?</i>
- <i>Whoa!</i>

17:20.622 --> 17:21.621
Awesome, man!

17:21.623 --> 17:22.622
And you, talk to you later.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.558
Bye!

17:25.292 --> 17:27.560
Enjoy the party.

17:27.561 --> 17:29.629
- <i>David, come on, man.</i>
- A hundred percent.

17:29.631 --> 17:32.064
I will do that.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.001
Yeah.

17:35.437 --> 17:36.371
Yeah.

17:40.308 --> 17:43.610
Your shirt is so soft!

17:43.612 --> 17:46.012
Thanks, it's my favorite.

17:46.014 --> 17:47.314
This is so amazing.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.816
- You should.. Not now, man.
- This is so amazing.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.817
This is so..

17:51.887 --> 17:54.588
Hi, I'm David, I'm David.

17:54.590 --> 17:56.123
- She doesn't care.
- No, but it's okay.

19:08.735 --> 19:10.035
Oh, yeah, this one.

19:17.510 --> 19:19.845
- Don't touch the fucking...
- Sorry.

19:19.847 --> 19:21.613
I thought I told you
not to touch the door.

19:21.615 --> 19:23.549
- I'm sorry, Ethan.
- Uh, I... I'm sorry!

19:23.551 --> 19:25.049
No, it's, uh, it's my fault.

19:25.051 --> 19:27.653
I... I... I asked her to show me
where the bathroom is.

19:27.655 --> 19:30.222
- Uh, I apologize.
- That's great, it's fine. Yeah.

19:30.224 --> 19:31.723
Don't worry about it,
it's just, you know

19:31.725 --> 19:34.029
we keep our valuables
down there, and so..

19:35.462 --> 19:37.329
- Don't touch the door.
- Okay.

19:37.331 --> 19:40.001
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

19:40.936 --> 19:42.769
You guys want a drink?

19:42.771 --> 19:45.507
- Yeah.
- Great! Cool, lead the way.

19:46.908 --> 19:49.943
Why don't you show him
where the drinks are?

21:10.562 --> 21:12.197
We have to kick
you guys out, sorry.

21:13.632 --> 21:15.200
<i>Yeah, we need to crash.</i>

21:16.036 --> 21:17.869
It's morning time.

21:17.871 --> 21:19.638
- I really thank you.
- Wild night.

21:20.774 --> 21:23.473
- Did you have fun?
- Come on, boys.

21:23.475 --> 21:25.442
Alright, sure. I mean,
I hope we didn't

21:25.444 --> 21:27.645
overstay our welcome and all.

21:27.647 --> 21:29.214
I really appreciate
your having us.

21:33.853 --> 21:34.986
What are you guys
doin' tomorrow?

21:34.988 --> 21:36.289
Nothing, why?

21:37.824 --> 21:39.624
We really like you guys.

21:39.626 --> 21:41.659
We think you might be
club material.

21:41.661 --> 21:42.895
Well, that...
that's really great.

21:42.897 --> 21:46.732
- We really like you, too.
- This was so much fun.

21:46.734 --> 21:49.001
Good, so, uh, pack a bag

21:49.003 --> 21:50.803
and we'll see you
tonight at 8:00.

21:50.805 --> 21:52.738
So is this like a,
is this like a bid?

21:52.740 --> 21:54.473
Eight o'clock.

21:54.475 --> 21:55.975
- Alright.
- Okay.

22:06.922 --> 22:08.988
<i>Dude, you told us
to get dressed two hours ago.</i>

22:08.990 --> 22:10.790
<i>Why are you still
getting packed?</i>

22:10.792 --> 22:12.559
'Cause it takes
a very long time

22:12.561 --> 22:15.328
to get me to look
this good, alright?

22:15.330 --> 22:17.363
Hey, do you think
those girls are there a lot?

22:17.365 --> 22:18.531
<i>Yeah, are you kidding?</i>

22:18.533 --> 22:19.666
They're probably there
all the time.

22:19.668 --> 22:21.135
It's an amazing house.

22:21.137 --> 22:23.738
My question is,
does the club own a yacht?

22:23.740 --> 22:26.674
Because I've always wanted
to get a blow job on a yacht.

22:26.676 --> 22:28.409
I think maybe
you should focus on, you know

22:28.411 --> 22:29.410
like kissing a girl

22:29.412 --> 22:31.814
or just a regular
blow job first.

22:33.683 --> 22:36.317
Guys, if we had
a house like that

22:36.319 --> 22:38.686
the girls would
definitely come to us.

22:38.688 --> 22:40.287
Alright, this whole
thing could be pretty fun.

22:40.289 --> 22:42.924
It's going to be incredible.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.254
Hello?

23:10.889 --> 23:12.789
- David?
- Hello?

23:12.791 --> 23:14.793
- Just go in their house?
- I don't know how.

23:15.693 --> 23:16.628
Hello?

23:21.399 --> 23:23.601
- Okay.
- Are we, uh, are we early?

23:24.103 --> 23:25.037
Wow.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.572
Guys?

23:33.879 --> 23:35.114
Welcome, gentlemen.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.854
Hi, Max, did you get much sleep?

23:42.856 --> 23:44.858
Put the bags on the floor
and get in line.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.837
The three of us
were talking last night.

23:58.839 --> 24:00.405
We realized
we might have given you

24:00.407 --> 24:03.275
the wrong idea about our club.

24:03.277 --> 24:06.979
You see, our club is not about
beautiful women and drugs.

24:06.981 --> 24:08.716
No, those are by-products.

24:09.684 --> 24:12.952
By-products of a singular focus.

24:12.954 --> 24:15.988
You see, the Crypteia
produces the best.

24:15.990 --> 24:19.061
Each and every member
dominates his field.

24:20.095 --> 24:23.696
<i>Advertising, tech, finance.</i>

24:23.698 --> 24:27.067
<i>So, if you pledge today, yes</i>

24:27.069 --> 24:28.969
<i>there are gonna be
beautiful women</i>

24:28.971 --> 24:32.939
<i>and lots of parties,
but more importantly</i>

24:32.941 --> 24:35.675
<i>you're gonna have a future
so fucking bright</i>

24:35.677 --> 24:37.111
<i>that you're gonna need
sunglasses</i>

24:37.113 --> 24:39.249
<i>every time you look
in the mirror.</i>

24:40.515 --> 24:42.682
Have I cleared this up?

24:42.684 --> 24:45.253
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- That sounds good.

24:45.255 --> 24:49.523
I think the word he was
looking for is, "Yes, sir."

24:49.525 --> 24:50.658
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.493
- Uh..
- Oh, no, no, no.

24:52.495 --> 24:54.397
You will speak
once you're spoken to.

24:55.732 --> 24:57.066
Yes, sir.

25:01.604 --> 25:03.238
- You had a question.
- <i>Yes.</i>

25:03.240 --> 25:06.509
Uh, is... is there gonna be more
pledges or is... is this it?

25:28.432 --> 25:30.735
I don't think
you're hearing me, Sam.

25:31.937 --> 25:34.205
You see, this club is exclusive.

25:36.309 --> 25:38.574
There are never more
than ten active members

25:38.576 --> 25:40.413
on campus at any time.

25:41.780 --> 25:43.581
You're at the doorway
to the elite.

25:45.918 --> 25:49.420
But that doesn't mean
you won't have to work for it.

25:49.422 --> 25:52.356
You see, privilege
comes with hard work

25:52.358 --> 25:56.095
comes with... sacrifice.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.467
So are you ready to pledge?

26:03.469 --> 26:04.568
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

26:04.570 --> 26:06.338
Louder, our members
don't mumble!

26:06.340 --> 26:07.471
- Yes, sir!
- <i>Yes, sir!</i>

26:07.473 --> 26:10.308
Are you ready
to be kings of the campus?

26:10.310 --> 26:12.877
- Yes, sir!
- Do you have what it takes?

26:12.879 --> 26:14.479
- <i>Yes, sir!</i>
- <i>Louder!</i>

26:14.481 --> 26:15.480
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

26:15.482 --> 26:16.614
One more time!

26:16.616 --> 26:18.550
- Yes, sir!
- Good!

26:18.552 --> 26:22.687
Over the next 48 hours,
you will be tested

26:22.689 --> 26:26.591
physically, mentally

26:26.593 --> 26:27.929
emotionally.

26:29.697 --> 26:30.898
Make us proud.

26:31.733 --> 26:34.002
We're in this together.

26:36.438 --> 26:39.239
- Phones, now.
- What?

26:39.241 --> 26:41.108
Come on, everybody, in the bag.

26:41.110 --> 26:42.144
O... okay.

26:50.719 --> 26:51.820
<i>Line up!</i>

27:14.611 --> 27:18.613
Alright, so, every year,
we pick a class president.

27:18.615 --> 27:20.284
Uh, who'd would like
to volunteer?

27:22.486 --> 27:24.585
I could do it, I mean,
I was very active in

27:24.587 --> 27:26.155
high school politics.

27:26.157 --> 27:27.224
Great!

27:34.298 --> 27:35.465
I resign as president.

27:35.467 --> 27:36.732
Well, as president,
I'm gonna need you to

27:36.734 --> 27:37.733
make a decision here.

27:37.735 --> 27:39.168
Right, um, I resigned.

27:39.170 --> 27:41.870
Do we brand you
or everybody else?

27:41.872 --> 27:42.871
I think there's some
confusion here.

27:42.873 --> 27:44.007
Time's up!

27:44.009 --> 27:47.043
<i>What the fuck?
What the fuck?</i>

27:50.549 --> 27:53.316
You're gonna have to think
faster than that, cocksuckers.

27:55.687 --> 27:57.455
Indecisiveness
will get you hurt.

27:57.457 --> 27:59.089
David, you had
a perfect opportunity

27:59.091 --> 28:00.491
and you messed it up.

28:00.493 --> 28:03.294
You see, guys, that is exactly
what you have this weekend

28:03.296 --> 28:06.530
a perfect opportunity to go
through 48 hours of hell.

28:06.532 --> 28:09.733
Yes, mind you, but still
come out on top.

28:09.735 --> 28:10.970
Right, Paul Blart?

28:15.608 --> 28:16.707
Who's next?

28:16.709 --> 28:18.443
You just said
that if he got branded

28:18.445 --> 28:19.977
the rest of us
didn't have to do it.

28:19.979 --> 28:21.846
That was only
if he made a decision.

28:21.848 --> 28:23.714
I'm gonna need you
to lean forward for me.

28:23.716 --> 28:26.017
No, man, I'm not
doing that, I'm not doing that.

28:26.019 --> 28:29.287
- It's quick, guys.
- Ricky, come on, man.

28:29.289 --> 28:30.856
There's gotta be another way.

28:30.858 --> 28:32.259
Somethin' else, you know?

28:33.727 --> 28:35.028
Sorry, bud.

28:41.236 --> 28:43.436
Can I pick the spot?

28:43.438 --> 28:44.771
Sure, man.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.374
Okay.

28:51.713 --> 28:54.180
Just like... right there, okay?

28:55.350 --> 28:56.916
Can... can you give me
a countdown?

28:56.918 --> 28:58.284
Yeah, sure, one.

29:01.022 --> 29:04.025
- Oh, God!
- <i>That's so fucked up!</i>

29:04.994 --> 29:06.126
Oh, my God!

29:06.128 --> 29:08.694
- I'm not doing this?
- Oh, my God!

29:08.696 --> 29:10.397
<i>I can't do this.</i>

29:10.399 --> 29:11.798
I can't do this.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.799
<i>Oh, come on,
we're gonna brand you</i>

29:12.801 --> 29:14.067
<i>for all the right reasons.</i>

29:14.069 --> 29:15.135
I'm not gonna do it.

29:15.137 --> 29:16.437
It's not a walk-on, boys.

29:16.439 --> 29:18.373
If I don't even get picked,
then I'm just branded.

29:18.375 --> 29:19.607
I don't want this!

29:19.609 --> 29:20.874
- <i>Turn around!</i>
- <i>This is fucked up.</i>

29:20.876 --> 29:24.878
- I, I can't do this.
- Shh.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.249
It's either cheek...

29:27.617 --> 29:29.551
or cheek.

29:29.553 --> 29:32.153
Ah, just come on,
just do it quick.

29:32.155 --> 29:33.323
<i>Just do it quick.</i>

29:33.924 --> 29:35.156
Ah..

29:35.158 --> 29:37.258
Say, "Thank you,
President David!"

29:37.260 --> 29:41.095
Oh, God, thank you,
President David.

29:41.097 --> 29:42.431
Cute butt!

29:45.336 --> 29:46.801
Fuck! Fuck!

29:49.907 --> 29:51.407
- Beautiful.
- <i>Alright, time out.</i>

29:51.409 --> 29:53.309
<i>This isn't happening.
Pause, guys.</i>

29:53.311 --> 29:55.244
- How about you, Spike Lee?
- David, Justin, I'm sorry.

29:55.246 --> 29:56.445
I'm... I'm... I'm through
with this.

29:56.447 --> 29:57.647
Stop, wait, please, please.

29:57.649 --> 29:58.881
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

29:58.883 --> 30:00.049
- I wanna go home. No. No.
- Calm down. Okay.

30:00.051 --> 30:01.850
Ricky, please,
I just wanna go home.

30:01.852 --> 30:03.052
<i>Sorry, I'm... I'm... I'm
through with this.</i>

30:03.054 --> 30:04.820
Alright, you can go.

30:04.822 --> 30:07.257
- Give me your word.
- Okay, okay.

30:07.259 --> 30:08.258
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Thank you, Ricky.

30:08.260 --> 30:10.927
I appreciate it.
No, no, oh!

30:17.135 --> 30:18.737
- <i>And you!</i>
- No!

30:29.482 --> 30:30.881
Okay, great.

30:30.883 --> 30:32.783
Cool off. Dinner's in five.

30:32.785 --> 30:34.254
<i>We're having pork chops!</i>

30:49.103 --> 30:50.135
Fuck.

30:50.137 --> 30:51.203
He said it would be
five seconds.

30:51.205 --> 30:52.504
It's way more than five seconds.

30:52.506 --> 30:55.440
Guys, it's... it's just hazing,
it's just hazing.

30:55.442 --> 30:57.242
Okay. I know it
fucking sucks, I know. I...

30:57.244 --> 30:58.645
Look, I've heard of way worse.

30:58.647 --> 31:00.912
You've heard of fraternities
that brand people?

31:00.914 --> 31:02.515
Yeah, sure, sure!

31:02.517 --> 31:04.317
My brother told me
that at his frat

31:04.319 --> 31:06.552
the president chopped
a pledge's finger off one time.

31:06.554 --> 31:09.088
That's not hazing,
that's fucking torture.

31:09.090 --> 31:11.357
This... this doesn't happen
at a fraternity, okay?

31:11.359 --> 31:12.859
We need to contact
the authorities.

31:12.861 --> 31:14.360
It's not a fraternity,
you know, it's a social club

31:14.362 --> 31:15.595
so let's just keep that in mind.

31:15.597 --> 31:16.929
Come on, guys,
look, when he comes back in

31:16.931 --> 31:18.264
I'm saying somethin',
we're going home.

31:18.266 --> 31:19.633
No, you're not, okay?

31:19.635 --> 31:21.067
What the fuck are you
talking about?

31:21.069 --> 31:22.935
I didn't come here
to get branded and leave!

31:22.937 --> 31:25.004
David, take a look around.
We're all hurt, okay?

31:25.006 --> 31:27.608
We can't keep doing this
for 48 hours. Look at him!

31:27.610 --> 31:29.643
No, you're not saying
a word, I swear to God!

31:31.347 --> 31:32.781
- Don't fucking blow it!
- I won't..

31:35.451 --> 31:36.687
<i>Hey!</i>

31:37.554 --> 31:39.188
That was fucking crazy.

31:40.323 --> 31:41.889
You all okay?

31:41.891 --> 31:43.393
That was shitty, Ricky.

31:46.962 --> 31:48.730
I know.

31:48.732 --> 31:51.668
But when you're pledging,
it's supposed to be shitty.

31:52.502 --> 31:53.668
Right.

31:53.670 --> 31:55.537
Look, guys,
I hate this as much as you do

31:55.539 --> 31:57.972
but if we wanna get there, we
have to keep to tradition first.

31:57.974 --> 31:59.610
Come on, man, I can't do this.

32:01.546 --> 32:04.313
<i>I... I can't do that, man.</i>

32:04.315 --> 32:08.086
Hey. Justin, come on, man.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.157
Look..

32:14.425 --> 32:17.460
It's getting too intense,
let me know.

32:17.462 --> 32:18.831
I'll make 'em ease up.

32:25.671 --> 32:26.605
Okay?

32:29.006 --> 32:30.873
Come on, come on.

33:08.883 --> 33:11.617
Rachel. Rachel, don't go.

33:11.619 --> 33:13.585
She probably just stayed over.

33:13.587 --> 33:14.588
Rachel!

33:18.058 --> 33:19.360
Just wait till it's over.

33:32.774 --> 33:34.040
<i>In line, gentlemen.</i>

33:34.042 --> 33:35.778
Take your positions.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.915
On your knees.

33:40.917 --> 33:41.851
Now!

33:43.886 --> 33:44.821
Bowls.

33:51.227 --> 33:52.560
Oh, my God.

33:52.562 --> 33:53.761
<i>Oh, that doesn't..</i>

33:53.763 --> 33:56.697
<i>We have prepared
something very special.</i>

33:56.699 --> 33:57.633
Oh!

34:00.838 --> 34:02.205
<i>Smells good, doesn't it?</i>

34:05.107 --> 34:07.107
- <i>Bret's quite the chef.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

34:07.109 --> 34:08.411
<i>Gotta love the seasoning.</i>

34:11.849 --> 34:12.815
Oh.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.855
<i>Bon appetit,</i> boys.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.389
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry,
um, what's in this exactly?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.161
What does this
have to do with the club?

34:26.163 --> 34:27.362
Just eat the soup.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.931
He's just looking
for a little context

34:28.933 --> 34:30.433
'cause, you know,
we're gonna eat it.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.203
- Max gave you an order.
- Bret.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.705
Look, guys, this is part
of tradition, okay?

34:35.706 --> 34:37.572
The Crypteia's been
doing this for centuries.

34:37.574 --> 34:38.876
Yeah, but this college
isn't even..

34:41.379 --> 34:43.748
We're looking for
your breaking point, gentlemen

34:46.117 --> 34:48.119
because great men
don't have one.

34:49.455 --> 34:51.822
So show us what kind
of men you are

34:51.824 --> 34:54.056
and eat the soup.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.346
- Now!
- <i>Let's go!</i>

35:15.348 --> 35:16.316
Eat it!

35:17.785 --> 35:19.885
<i>With your fingers and hands!</i>

35:21.656 --> 35:24.222
<i>Get your fucking mouth
in there!</i>

35:24.224 --> 35:27.560
<i>There you go, come on,
pick up the pace a little bit.</i>

35:27.562 --> 35:29.962
<i>Show a little life!</i>

35:29.964 --> 35:31.463
You like that,
you little pussy?

35:31.465 --> 35:35.167
- Fucking eat the soup!
- Come on, eat it!

35:35.169 --> 35:38.504
Now, now, now! Swallow it!

35:38.506 --> 35:40.474
<i>I wanna see it
all over your hair!</i>

35:41.810 --> 35:43.009
<i>You know what,
if any of you spit out</i>

35:43.011 --> 35:44.276
<i>this fucking soup on my table</i>

35:44.278 --> 35:48.048
I swear to God,
I will fucking bury you!

35:53.522 --> 35:54.956
<i>You know,
your brothers have prepared</i>

35:54.958 --> 35:56.156
this wonderful meal for you

35:56.158 --> 35:58.425
and you wanna spit my own food
out on my table?

36:04.067 --> 36:06.266
Everybody on the floor now!

36:06.268 --> 36:07.635
Crawl!

36:07.637 --> 36:09.337
Crawl like the little
bitches you are!

36:09.339 --> 36:12.506
- Go, go, go!
- <i>Nose and toes, gentlemen.</i>

36:14.210 --> 36:16.410
Nose and toes
right fucking now!

36:16.412 --> 36:19.748
- I don't do knees.
- Get on your elbows!

36:19.750 --> 36:21.783
- Are you fucking stupid?
- No.

36:21.785 --> 36:24.553
Shut the fuck up.
Are you fucking stupid?

36:24.555 --> 36:27.089
- Yes.
- Shut the fuck up!

36:27.091 --> 36:30.726
Are you fucking stupid?

36:34.965 --> 36:36.131
Are you stupid?

36:36.133 --> 36:37.967
- Do you want me to...
- Shut the fuck up!

36:37.969 --> 36:39.735
Jesus Christ!

36:39.737 --> 36:40.870
Get him, get him.

36:40.872 --> 36:43.706
Tighten it,
tighten it, tighten it!

36:53.852 --> 36:56.086
You are such a stupid asshole.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.520
I must be doing something wrong

36:57.522 --> 37:01.091
'cause every single one of you
deserve to fucking die

37:01.093 --> 37:05.261
and instead, I have to sit here
and take care of you!

37:10.670 --> 37:13.237
- How do you like that?
- Whoo!

37:22.015 --> 37:23.547
- You fucking love it!
- Oh!

37:23.549 --> 37:25.382
- Oh, fuck!
- Shut up.

37:25.384 --> 37:26.818
<i>Do you fucking love it?</i>

37:26.820 --> 37:28.920
Damn it, what the fuck is wrong?

37:28.922 --> 37:31.456
Why do we always get
the fucking losers?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.091
What the fuck is wrong with us?

37:34.561 --> 37:38.296
Beat him, beat him.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.598
- Shut the fuck up!
- Whoo!

37:44.371 --> 37:48.007
- <i>Shit!</i>
- That is fucking disgusting.

37:48.009 --> 37:50.443
Did you just fucking vomit
on my goddamn floor?

37:50.445 --> 37:51.977
Did you fucking vomit?

37:51.979 --> 37:52.978
You motherfucker.

37:54.582 --> 37:58.851
Yeah. Get in there,
nice and clean, Mr. Mop and Glo.

38:11.633 --> 38:14.202
<i>Okay, everybody,
on your feet, let's go!</i>

38:14.204 --> 38:15.535
<i>Get the fuck up!</i>

38:15.537 --> 38:17.004
Get the fuck up,
through the door

38:17.006 --> 38:19.706
<i>through the fucking door, go!</i>

38:19.708 --> 38:21.976
<i>Let's fucking go,
you fat fuck!</i>

38:22.979 --> 38:26.446
<i>Max, Ricky, open up!</i>

38:29.786 --> 38:30.720
<i>Where's Stacey?</i>

38:32.956 --> 38:35.124
Ricky, tell me where she is.
I know she's here.

38:35.126 --> 38:37.126
I haven't seen her
since yesterday.

38:37.128 --> 38:38.129
Have you heard?

38:43.533 --> 38:45.368
So, uh, Bret, if you wouldn't
mind doing the honors..

38:47.303 --> 38:49.305
We've prepared a very lovely
place for you all to sleep.

38:51.575 --> 38:54.576
Oh, and, uh, I need
to get this chair right..

38:54.578 --> 38:57.182
Gentlemen, your new bedroom.

38:59.383 --> 39:00.584
Why don't we start with you?

39:02.520 --> 39:04.120
It's not quite a hotel room

39:04.122 --> 39:05.824
<i>but I think it'll serve
its purpose.</i>

39:08.425 --> 39:10.226
Come on.

39:10.228 --> 39:12.428
Now, I expect you all
to get some really good rest

39:12.430 --> 39:14.364
and in the morning,
be sharp and ready to go

39:14.366 --> 39:15.465
for more of the pledging.

39:15.467 --> 39:16.833
Sound good? Excellent.

39:16.835 --> 39:19.369
Oh, uh, watch out
for the rats in the back.

39:36.355 --> 39:37.755
Fuck.

39:37.757 --> 39:39.390
The floor's actually
not so uncomfortable.

39:39.392 --> 39:40.992
David, shut up.

39:40.994 --> 39:43.028
The light will be a problem,
but I can lie on this floor.

39:43.030 --> 39:44.798
David, shut up.

39:46.566 --> 39:48.867
- I could... I could...
- David, shut the fuck up, man.

39:48.869 --> 39:50.735
This is your fault we're here.

39:50.737 --> 39:52.604
Now, what the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

39:52.606 --> 39:54.139
Are you kidding me right now?

39:54.141 --> 39:56.309
This was all your idea.
You brought us here.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.944
You got us branded, you did all
this shit. It's your fault.

39:58.946 --> 40:00.545
Oh, this is my fault?
You didn't want to be here?

40:00.547 --> 40:02.649
No, man! I didn't
wanna do any of this shit!

40:04.085 --> 40:06.451
And you know what?
I would have said me.

40:06.453 --> 40:07.586
<i>What the fuck does that mean?</i>

40:07.588 --> 40:09.757
When they asked to brand
you or everybody else..

40:12.393 --> 40:15.661
...I would've said,
I would've said me.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.466
I mean, who doesn't,
who doesn't say that?

40:22.804 --> 40:25.072
Okay, that's ridiculous. They
didn't give me a chance to say..

40:25.074 --> 40:26.374
...to say anything.

41:17.461 --> 41:18.663
Hey.

41:29.608 --> 41:32.976
- What is this?
- Tequila. Enjoy.

41:32.978 --> 41:35.145
Look, I think my burn's
infected, man. Can I get out?

41:35.147 --> 41:37.383
- I'll let 'em know.
- No, seriously. Hey!

how'd you sleep?

Did you, uh,
stay away from the rats?

Well, you've been here
for, uh, 12 hours.

My burn's infected,
I need to go.

44:25.925 --> 44:28.327
You know, I think we can get
that taken care of, actually.

44:28.329 --> 44:29.760
Oh, yes, we can!

44:29.762 --> 44:31.298
Come, right this way.

44:56.258 --> 44:58.024
Alright, pledges,
right this way.

44:58.026 --> 44:59.692
Gentlemen,
please have your seats.

44:59.694 --> 45:00.827
Hey, Max, man,
is there any way

45:00.829 --> 45:02.396
I could get just, like,
a pretzel or something?

45:02.398 --> 45:03.531
Yeah, sure, I'll get you
something to eat.

45:03.533 --> 45:06.333
Don't worry, I've taken
good care of you so far.

45:06.335 --> 45:08.402
Ethan, you're my golden boy.

45:08.404 --> 45:10.339
Why don't you take
this golden seat?

45:15.745 --> 45:19.148
I am terribly sorry for the way
you've been treated so far.

45:20.716 --> 45:22.250

45:30.627 --> 45:31.694

45:32.863 --> 45:34.464
Can I get a little excitement?

45:36.833 --> 45:39.267
Come on, give me
some excitement!

45:39.269 --> 45:41.169
<i>Okay, clap, there we go!</i>

45:41.171 --> 45:43.539
Okay, so, cue music.

45:46.311 --> 45:48.578
Gentlemen..

45:48.580 --> 45:50.779
...for you.

45:52.550 --> 45:54.951
- Ooh!
- <i>Oh, man.</i>

45:54.953 --> 45:56.385
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

45:56.387 --> 45:58.522

to go around.</i>

- <i>Ooh!</i>
- Oh!

46:02.361 --> 46:04.597
- It wasn't cheap!
- God damn.

46:05.631 --> 46:07.264
I'm happy my legs are crossed.

46:07.266 --> 46:08.599
Woo!

46:10.768 --> 46:12.703
- Woo!
- <i>Oh.. Oh..</i>

46:12.705 --> 46:14.338
- Woo!
- <i>Oh..</i>

46:14.340 --> 46:16.373
<i>Oh, man!</i>

46:16.375 --> 46:17.941
Ow!

46:19.778 --> 46:21.346
<i>Damn.</i>

46:22.716 --> 46:25.048
<i>Oh, man. Yeah!</i>

46:25.050 --> 46:26.653
<i>Come on, heartthrob.</i>

46:30.190 --> 46:31.757
- Woo!
- Fuck.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.793
College, guys,
am I right?

46:36.830 --> 46:39.397
Ethan, uh, you're injured.

46:39.399 --> 46:41.367
Would you mind terribly?

46:41.369 --> 46:44.637
- I'm okay.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's fine.

46:44.639 --> 46:46.070
<i>It's on us, really.</i>

46:46.072 --> 46:47.939
You know, she's here
to do her job.

46:47.941 --> 46:49.742
- Thank you.
- <i>Really, I'm okay.</i>

46:49.744 --> 46:51.343
Don't worry,
she's gonna make sure

46:51.345 --> 46:52.947
you're back in tip-top shape.

47:00.988 --> 47:03.456
I'm sure you know..

47:03.458 --> 47:05.824
Yeah, just be careful.

47:05.826 --> 47:07.562
Oh, that looks infected.

47:11.733 --> 47:13.768
That's better. Thank you.

47:16.673 --> 47:20.142
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah, round two, baby.

47:21.411 --> 47:23.344
<i>Hey, we're not
paying extra for that.</i>

47:28.318 --> 47:29.951
Rachel?

47:36.025 --> 47:37.393
Run.

47:46.804 --> 47:48.203
Yeah!

47:50.941 --> 47:52.140
<i>Fuckin'..</i>

47:52.142 --> 47:54.042
That was awesome, right?

47:54.044 --> 47:55.844
Alright, boys,
you sit tight

47:55.846 --> 47:57.212
I'm gonna get you some snacks.

47:57.214 --> 47:59.617
And you said you wanted
pretzels, right?

48:00.819 --> 48:03.051
Great.

48:11.129 --> 48:13.730
Guys.
Shh, come here.

48:13.732 --> 48:15.398
We have to go now.

48:15.400 --> 48:17.033
You're gonna mess it up
for all of us.

48:17.035 --> 48:18.968
No, you can pledge
without us, okay?

48:18.970 --> 48:20.303
We need to leave.

48:20.305 --> 48:21.705
Okay, can you just
tell me what's happening?

48:21.707 --> 48:23.940
I will tell you outside.
We have to go.

48:23.942 --> 48:26.008
This is a bad idea.
We're almost done here, guys.

48:26.010 --> 48:29.313
Are you sure? Because I think
staying here is a real bad idea.

48:29.315 --> 48:31.749
- It's just hazing.
- Yeah, this is what frats do.

48:31.751 --> 48:34.720
David... this isn't a frat.

48:36.055 --> 48:37.588
<i>We have to go.</i>

48:37.590 --> 48:39.591
Are you coming?

48:39.593 --> 48:41.458
Yeah, I'm coming.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.160
- Okay, let's go.
- Alright. Let's go.

48:43.162 --> 48:44.664
Shh.

48:50.936 --> 48:52.837
What the fuck?

48:56.811 --> 48:58.176
Where are you going?

48:58.178 --> 49:00.245
- Why is the door locked?
- Uh..

49:00.247 --> 49:02.380
Max didn't want any more girls
showing up, so..

49:02.382 --> 49:04.949
We were gonna go get some food.
We were feeling...

49:04.951 --> 49:06.354
We're leaving.

49:08.322 --> 49:09.921
Come on.

49:09.923 --> 49:11.524
<i>You're almost done.</i>

49:11.526 --> 49:13.259
Hey, look,
Ethan's really hurt

49:13.261 --> 49:16.495
and he needs to see
a doctor or a nurse.

49:16.497 --> 49:18.397
You know, I think, like,
a nurse with an actual

49:18.399 --> 49:20.702
medical degree
and not just a outfit.

49:23.271 --> 49:26.972
If you leave, that's it.

49:26.974 --> 49:28.109
You're out.

49:30.546 --> 49:31.979
You get that, right?

49:34.950 --> 49:35.951
Yeah.

49:37.352 --> 49:38.620
I'm sorry.

49:40.255 --> 49:41.521
Let's just..

49:41.523 --> 49:44.425
Let's get your phones,
your bags..

49:44.427 --> 49:48.028
- And cab home on me.
- Thank you, but I'd rather go.

49:48.030 --> 49:50.164
- <i>We need to get our phones.</i>
- Why do we need our phones?

49:50.166 --> 49:51.532
Fuck it,
I'll get a new one.

49:51.534 --> 49:55.102
Campus is, like, two miles away,
and Ethan's hurt.

49:55.104 --> 49:56.172
We need to call a cab.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.844
Fuckin' fine. Can... can we just
hurry, please?

50:01.044 --> 50:02.711
Okay.

50:02.713 --> 50:04.278
- No.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

50:04.280 --> 50:06.750
- Guys. Don't. Guys, guys.
- By the piano.

50:13.524 --> 50:15.693
I don't... I don't
see any bags. I don't..

50:19.363 --> 50:21.296
They try to run?

50:21.298 --> 50:23.900
- <i>Yup.</i>
- Hmm.

50:23.902 --> 50:25.300
Fuck this. Fuck this, man.
Fuck, I wanna...

50:25.302 --> 50:29.472
Get back inside or I will rip
your fuckin' nose off!

50:29.474 --> 50:31.039
- <i>Whoa, hey!</i>
- Really, guys?

50:31.041 --> 50:32.675
Without saying goodbye?

50:32.677 --> 50:34.444
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

50:34.446 --> 50:37.247
<i>Look, I..
Can we just go and... and...</i>

50:37.249 --> 50:39.082
- People know we're here.
- No, they don't.

50:39.084 --> 50:40.517
Yes, they do,
I texted them.

50:40.519 --> 50:41.652
Right when we got here,
I texted them.

50:41.654 --> 50:44.254
I checked all your phones.

50:44.256 --> 50:46.423
<i>Look, we... we just wanna go.
Ethan's really hurt.</i>

50:46.425 --> 50:47.858
- Let us go.
- On your knees.

50:47.860 --> 50:49.058
Okay, this isn't necessary.

50:49.060 --> 50:50.561
If you could just
let us walk out the door

50:50.563 --> 50:51.695
right now,
everything'll be fine.

50:51.697 --> 50:53.330
Will you just get on
the fucking floor?

50:53.332 --> 50:56.333
No, okay? Now we are leaving,
and that's it!

50:56.335 --> 50:58.904
Alright, I... I'm sorry, I know
this was a big opportunity

50:58.906 --> 51:01.105
<i>and I was excited,
but it's over.</i>

51:02.876 --> 51:04.441
No, stop!

51:04.443 --> 51:07.612
<i>There's no need for that,
guys. Come on.</i>

51:07.614 --> 51:09.314
- Fuckin' baby.
- Watch it.

51:10.450 --> 51:12.049
- Hey!
- Get the fuck off me!

51:12.051 --> 51:14.020
It wasn't me. I swear.
It wasn't me.

51:14.022 --> 51:17.222
- He's just trying to..
- Shut up!

51:17.224 --> 51:20.358
<i>Now you're all gonna be part
of a little experiment.</i>

51:20.360 --> 51:21.528
Oh, fuck.

51:22.964 --> 51:25.196
On the floor, now.

51:25.198 --> 51:27.198
- Please, man, come on.
- Now!

51:27.200 --> 51:30.170
Now, I want you all
to pay attention carefully.

51:31.306 --> 51:33.005
<i>I have no medical training..</i>

51:33.007 --> 51:34.540
- Max, Max.
- ...whatsoever.

51:34.542 --> 51:36.142
<i>We don't want to
pledge anymore.</i>

51:36.144 --> 51:37.643
We're done. Just let us go.
I'm begging you.

51:37.645 --> 51:40.013
- <i>Ethan, they don't care.</i>
- Max.

51:40.015 --> 51:42.851
If you were all wondering
what you had for dinner..

51:48.323 --> 51:49.623
<i>What is that? Hey.</i>

51:49.625 --> 51:52.159
Oh, fuck. Jesus.

51:52.161 --> 51:55.095
- What the fuck. Max.
- I just wanna go.

51:55.097 --> 51:56.630
- What are you doing, man?
- <i>Max!</i>

51:56.632 --> 51:58.799
You know, this rat
kinda reminds me of you.

51:58.801 --> 52:01.035
<i>What the fuck? Hey.</i>

52:01.037 --> 52:03.838
- It's scared.
- <i>Max, Ricky, this is crazy.</i>

52:03.840 --> 52:05.240
And it's starving.

52:06.876 --> 52:08.009
- Come on. Sam.
- <i>We'll do whatever you want.</i>

52:08.011 --> 52:11.913
Don't do this.
No, hey, don't! Max!

52:11.915 --> 52:14.549
Max! Stop it!

52:14.551 --> 52:16.286
<i>Stop, this is crazy!</i>

52:25.261 --> 52:27.898
Fuck, I can't watch this,
I can't watch this.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.634
You watching, pledges?

52:31.636 --> 52:33.402
Stop.

52:37.375 --> 52:39.943
Stop! Stop it!

52:39.945 --> 52:41.610
Sam!

52:44.348 --> 52:46.382
<i>Make that little bitch
watch it!</i>

52:46.384 --> 52:47.884
Max, stop it!

52:51.222 --> 52:54.324
<i>Let him go, let him go,
let him go, man.</i>

52:54.326 --> 52:55.727
<i>You guys watching?</i>

52:59.197 --> 53:01.631
Keep your eyes forward!

53:25.191 --> 53:28.026
Somebody help me, come on!

53:34.234 --> 53:35.267
Fuck.

53:35.269 --> 53:37.038
Stop this, stop this.

53:40.641 --> 53:43.743
Just pass out, pass out,
pass out. Shh.

53:43.745 --> 53:45.479
Shh! Shh!

54:27.124 --> 54:31.528
Oh, boy, do we have a surprise
coming for you guys.

54:32.696 --> 54:34.162
<i>It's about fucking time, huh?</i>

54:34.164 --> 54:36.564
Okay, my, my aunt has
a lot of money, alright?

54:36.566 --> 54:38.200
<i>So if you just please
let me call her</i>

54:38.202 --> 54:39.969
<i>just please... please..</i>

54:39.971 --> 54:41.871
Jesus Christ,
I cannot wait to put

54:41.873 --> 54:43.239
your fucking head on a spit.

54:43.241 --> 54:45.241
All this guy has done
since he's gotten here

54:45.243 --> 54:47.542
is just fucking bitch,
bitch, bitch!

54:47.544 --> 54:50.880
You fucking ingrate,
what is your fucking problem?

54:50.882 --> 54:52.681
Let me please just call her!
I'll call her, it'll be fine!

54:52.683 --> 54:54.750
She'll make it okay,
she'll make it okay, please!

54:54.752 --> 54:57.154
- Shut your fucking..
- <i>What the fuck!</i>

54:57.156 --> 54:59.622
Oh, fuck! Oh, jeez!

55:06.464 --> 55:07.731
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

55:07.733 --> 55:09.835
Okay, everybody
just calm down.

55:12.838 --> 55:15.174
- Come on.
- <i>Justin.</i>

55:18.443 --> 55:19.609
Put the fire iron down.

55:19.611 --> 55:21.344
Fuck you,
you lizard illuminati

55:21.346 --> 55:22.479
pieces of shit.

55:24.383 --> 55:26.651
I think you're getting your
conspiracy theories mixed up.

55:26.653 --> 55:29.486
Justin, what are you gonna do?

55:29.488 --> 55:32.023
What am I gonna do? Why don't
you come and see, Ricky, huh?

55:32.025 --> 55:33.191
- Okay, alright.
- Huh, buddy?

55:33.193 --> 55:37.196
Come on, pork chop!
Bring it on!

55:37.198 --> 55:39.497
Fuck this motherfucker!
Come here!

55:39.499 --> 55:41.734
- Go, go!
- Get 'em, get 'em!

55:57.551 --> 55:59.254
<i>Pledges, open the door.</i>

56:04.558 --> 56:06.059
<i>Pledges!</i>

56:47.637 --> 56:49.039
<i>Hello?</i>

56:52.276 --> 56:53.575
Pledges, open the door.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.010
<i>You need to give us
our phones.</i>

56:55.012 --> 56:57.112
Open the door and maybe
we can talk about that.

56:57.114 --> 56:59.080
You're insane!
You need help!

56:59.082 --> 57:02.218
- Go the fuck away!
- <i>David.</i>

57:02.220 --> 57:03.752
<i>I've got a group
of girls downstairs</i>

57:03.754 --> 57:05.388
<i>that wanna suck your cock.</i>

57:30.916 --> 57:32.448
Ben..

57:32.450 --> 57:34.051
<i>If you could open that door</i>

57:34.053 --> 57:35.852
you would have
opened it already.

57:35.854 --> 57:38.021
You would have been through that
door already, but you're not!

57:38.023 --> 57:40.924
<i>You're not through it, so
I know you can't get through!</i>

57:40.926 --> 57:44.062
Listen, Max, you have Sam

57:44.064 --> 57:46.331
and you have Ben.

57:46.333 --> 57:48.099
Let us go.

57:48.101 --> 57:49.836
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

57:55.775 --> 57:56.943
<i>Oh, God.</i>

57:58.912 --> 57:59.978
What?

57:59.980 --> 58:02.214
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, what?

58:07.021 --> 58:08.688
<i>Pledges, open the door.</i>

58:13.627 --> 58:16.261
- <i>Open the fucking door!</i>
- It's a stalemate.

58:16.263 --> 58:18.699
We're not coming out,
you're not getting in!

58:25.506 --> 58:28.509
- Motherfucking..
- Shh! Easy, easy.

58:32.114 --> 58:34.681
Stick to the fucking plan.

58:34.683 --> 58:35.784
Easy.

58:46.329 --> 58:47.794
<i>If they won't open up
the fucking door</i>

58:47.796 --> 58:48.996
<i>then you know
what I'm gonna do?</i>

58:48.998 --> 58:50.231
<i>I'm gonna take a knife
and I'm gonna</i>

58:50.233 --> 58:52.433
<i>fucking crack
their skulls open..</i>

58:52.435 --> 58:53.603
<i>You mother..</i>

58:57.441 --> 58:58.639
You selfish fuck!

58:58.641 --> 59:00.641
<i>We have three freshmen</i>

59:00.643 --> 59:02.877
locked in a bathroom upstairs

59:02.879 --> 59:04.680
and you're down here with us?

59:11.855 --> 59:15.491
<i>See, you guys just don't
get it, do you?</i>

59:15.493 --> 59:19.063
You talk on and on
and on and on.

59:21.065 --> 59:23.965
See, it's not about
hurting these people.

59:23.967 --> 59:26.302
It's about learning not
to see them as people at all.

59:26.304 --> 59:27.872
Shut the fuck up!

59:31.409 --> 59:32.508
Let's handle this.

59:32.510 --> 59:34.177
Yeah, well, a minute ago
I saw them tear

59:34.179 --> 59:35.580
right through you guys.

59:41.554 --> 59:43.619
Careful, Ben.

59:43.621 --> 59:44.656
Yeah?

59:45.957 --> 59:48.791
Maybe I should just skip
the trip upstairs.

59:48.793 --> 59:50.062
Come on, try it.

59:51.764 --> 59:53.097
Come on, little man.

59:53.099 --> 59:55.734
- Fuck!
- Okay, alright. Enough.

01:00:07.914 --> 01:00:09.249
Shh.

01:00:31.205 --> 01:00:32.807
<i>I don't hear anything.</i>

01:00:35.776 --> 01:00:37.445
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

01:00:51.927 --> 01:00:53.362
We gotta think of something.

01:00:56.064 --> 01:00:57.632
We need to go.

01:00:57.634 --> 01:01:00.568
We gotta get out of here
right now, okay?

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:01.868
- We gotta move.
- Yeah, but how?

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:02.869
<i>We're just gonna run.</i>

01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:04.605
We're gonna run and swing

01:01:04.607 --> 01:01:06.840
and fight until
we're just out that door.

01:01:06.842 --> 01:01:08.442
David, we don't know what's
on the other side of that door.

01:01:08.444 --> 01:01:10.777
They're just people.
They're just human..

01:01:10.779 --> 01:01:14.348
They're college students.
One of them is four feet tall.

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:16.784
<i>We can get the fuck
outta here right now.</i>

01:01:16.786 --> 01:01:18.121
<i>Alright,
you good with that?</i>

01:01:19.856 --> 01:01:22.560
Okay. Fuck it, fuck it.
Yeah, alright.

01:01:24.328 --> 01:01:26.197
Yeah, alright. Fuck!

01:01:27.998 --> 01:01:30.067
Oh, shit.
Oh, fucking shit.

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.672
- Alright, man.
- One..

01:01:35.674 --> 01:01:37.139
Two... three.

01:02:03.001 --> 01:02:04.968
David?

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:06.936
- Oh! Ah!
- David?

01:02:06.938 --> 01:02:09.406
No! Let's go! Let's go!

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.499
Hey, come on, come on. I found
a way, let's go, let's go.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.601
Yeah, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:02:36.603 --> 01:02:38.903
Go, go, go, go!

01:02:38.905 --> 01:02:40.508
<i>To the right,
to the right.</i>

01:02:50.585 --> 01:02:52.754
- Which way?
- Come on, we're going this way.

01:02:59.093 --> 01:03:00.926
Guys.

01:03:00.928 --> 01:03:01.896
Shh.

01:03:03.798 --> 01:03:05.898
- You hear that, right?
- No, no, no, it's this way.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.401
No, no, no, Shh, shh.
Listen.

01:03:08.437 --> 01:03:10.805
- Oh, there it is.
- Come on.

01:03:11.907 --> 01:03:13.008
Come on.

01:03:29.092 --> 01:03:32.260
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

01:03:32.262 --> 01:03:34.130
<i>Build a mansion on
a bunch of tunnels?</i>

01:03:40.738 --> 01:03:42.105
What the hell?

01:03:45.842 --> 01:03:46.874
What?

01:03:49.613 --> 01:03:51.046
Rachel.

01:03:51.048 --> 01:03:53.749
Alright. It's okay.

01:03:53.751 --> 01:03:55.486
<i>Please, hold still. Uh..</i>

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.827
Do you know how to
get out of here?

01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:05.497
I don't.. I don't know.

01:04:07.232 --> 01:04:09.132
Ben, do you..

01:04:09.134 --> 01:04:11.101
- <i>What the hell?</i>
- Ben?

01:04:11.103 --> 01:04:13.703
This is starting to feel
like a trap again.

01:04:13.705 --> 01:04:15.905
No, listen to me. They're
fucking psychopaths, man.

01:04:15.907 --> 01:04:17.710
They killed Sam.

01:04:19.044 --> 01:04:20.178
They killed Dav..

01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:23.046
How do you know
we can trust her?

01:04:23.048 --> 01:04:25.549
- She helped us, alright?
- Helped us when, man?

01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:27.318
She's the one who brought
us here in the first place.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.652
She's the reason
we're pledging at all.

01:04:28.654 --> 01:04:29.722
Look!

01:04:33.659 --> 01:04:35.863
<i>You're not the ones pledging.</i>

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:47.272
We gotta go.

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:49.140
<i>We gotta go right now.</i>

01:04:49.142 --> 01:04:51.143
Alright, come on.

01:04:51.145 --> 01:04:52.446
<i>Alright, come on.</i>

01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:01.917
Rachel! Rachel!
Hey!

01:06:01.919 --> 01:06:03.320
Oh, come on.

01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:45.663
Shit.

01:06:52.205 --> 01:06:54.340
End of the line, boys.

01:06:55.942 --> 01:06:59.845
Oh, I am so goddamn
excited for this.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.499
Eh, fuck it. Let's do it.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.447
- Come on, fat boy!
- Ah!

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.421
Come on.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.964
Yeah, squeal like a pig,
fuckin' fat boy!

01:08:33.511 --> 01:08:34.977
- <i>Watch it. Watch it.</i>
- Ah!

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:36.180
Come on!

01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:39.515
- Ah!
- You like that?

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.158
Oh! Ah!

01:09:04.743 --> 01:09:06.078
Come on!

01:09:28.201 --> 01:09:30.404
Yeah!

01:09:36.577 --> 01:09:37.745
Woo!

01:11:02.367 --> 01:11:03.668
Max!

01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:17.416
Please.

01:11:23.722 --> 01:11:24.790
Please.

01:11:25.992 --> 01:11:27.160
Please!

01:11:41.976 --> 01:11:43.842
Please.

01:11:43.844 --> 01:11:45.679
Help. Please.
