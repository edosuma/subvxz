00:28.206 --> 00:29.700
What's that?

00:29.916 --> 00:31.280
Ah, it's nothin'.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.607
Does Jenny know?

00:32.627 --> 00:34.987
I'm the man of my house, Tom.

00:35.004 --> 00:37.696
I don't have to hide things
from my wife.

00:37.715 --> 00:39.209
I won't tell her.

00:40.051 --> 00:41.710
I appreciate it.

00:46.975 --> 00:47.924
Try this.

00:48.476 --> 00:50.967
The nicotine's not your problem.
It's your oral fixation.

00:50.979 --> 00:53.007
You just need
something else to suck on.

00:53.022 --> 00:54.884
I read it in some magazine.

00:54.899 --> 00:56.346
What kind of magazines
you been reading?

00:56.359 --> 00:57.023
Easy.

01:01.030 --> 01:02.857
A man's gotta be able
to have something of his own.

01:09.621 --> 01:11.365
How many shooters you count?

01:12.290 --> 01:13.453
Five, six.

01:14.918 --> 01:17.029
Somebody tipped them off.

01:17.045 --> 01:20.212
All I know is we just lost
two whole fucking years of work.

01:21.716 --> 01:23.294
Want to take a look?

01:29.557 --> 01:34.100
As long as it's just a look. On three.

01:34.812 --> 01:35.558
Three.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.199
Son of a bitch.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.494
Hey Tom. Backup's on its way.

02:43.503 --> 02:45.199
FBI! Freeze! / Tom!

02:45.213 --> 02:46.458
Jesus Christ!

03:12.197 --> 03:13.311
Don't jump off!

03:49.316 --> 03:50.265
No!

03:55.948 --> 03:57.976
John! You all right?

03:57.991 --> 03:59.022
Yeah.

04:00.744 --> 04:01.657
Come on.

04:09.085 --> 04:10.116
Did you get him?

04:10.128 --> 04:11.955
I got him.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.364
You sure?

04:13.381 --> 04:15.658
He took one in the face.
He's dead. Relax.

04:15.675 --> 04:18.829
Hey, the morgue's full of people who
thought they got that son of a bitch.

04:18.844 --> 04:22.581
What are you talking about, John?
You sound like you know this guy.

04:22.598 --> 04:24.840
Yeah, but there's talk the Yakuza

04:24.850 --> 04:27.886
hired a rogue independent contractor
to deal with the Triads.

04:27.895 --> 04:29.839
He's supposed to be the best.

04:29.855 --> 04:32.346
The same guy the CIA used
in Jakarta that time.

04:32.357 --> 04:33.092
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:33.108 --> 04:36.679
The same guy that turned on his
handlers and then killed three agents.

04:36.696 --> 04:38.273
I heard it was five.

04:38.281 --> 04:40.890
That's a bullshit story, John.
You know that, all right?

04:40.908 --> 04:42.486
The Rogue's a phantom; he's a myth.

04:42.493 --> 04:44.437
Somebody at the Agency's
yanking your chain.

04:44.453 --> 04:46.564
Titanium shells.
The penetrating bullets.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.908
It was his signature.

04:51.710 --> 04:55.161
You really think
Rogue was working for Yakuza?

04:55.172 --> 04:57.460
That's the trouble with this business.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.547
You never know who's working for who.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.338
This is the San Francisco Police.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.803
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.811
Yeah, he's right here,
he's right here, John.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.782
Hang... yeah, see you soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

05:33.500 --> 05:38.280
You tell him that
he cannot smoke in front of the kids.

05:38.296 --> 05:41.866
If he's going to smoke
he can do it in the yard.

05:41.882 --> 05:42.831
Okay.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.046
Okay.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.791
I thought he was already coming.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.333
I thought he was, too.

05:48.347 --> 05:49.497
Yo, Tom.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.049
I gotcha!

05:50.057 --> 05:51.504
Uh, Daniel, please.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.676
- Danny, Danny. I'm on the phone.
- Daniel, come on. Come on.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.011
You'd better be on the road.
Game starts in thirty.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.216
I'm running a little behind.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.387
Figure if we don't hit traffic,
we'll make it up there by half-time.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.679
John.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.475
It's an oral fixation.

06:05.489 --> 06:09.439
Ecch! Hey. Come on.
Get your coat.

06:09.451 --> 06:12.737
So uh, how's the case going?

06:12.746 --> 06:15.605
Look forget about the case.
Enjoy your sick leave.

06:15.624 --> 06:17.071
Any ideas who blew the op?

06:17.084 --> 06:20.239
No. Investigation's underway.
So far... zip.

06:20.253 --> 06:21.487
Somebody talked.

06:21.504 --> 06:24.114
Somebody inside. Close to us.

06:24.132 --> 06:25.828
Any word on what happened to Rogue?

06:25.842 --> 06:27.075
No, we never found a body.

06:27.093 --> 06:29.038
They dragged that bay
for three days and nothing.

06:29.053 --> 06:31.745
And he's fish food by now.

06:31.764 --> 06:32.962
Okay.

06:32.974 --> 06:34.883
Well, it's game day, right?

06:34.892 --> 06:36.126
Yeah, I know it's game day.

06:36.143 --> 06:38.219
Just tell me you haven't
forgot the steaks, okay?

06:38.229 --> 06:41.384
No, asshole,
I didn't forget the steaks.

06:41.398 --> 06:43.142
Christ, when are you
going to let that go?

06:43.150 --> 06:44.265
Diane asked me to check.

06:44.276 --> 06:45.344
You know she also asked me to...

06:45.360 --> 06:49.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard.
No smoking in front of the kids.

06:53.201 --> 06:56.202
Honey, we got to stop off
and get some steaks.

07:26.609 --> 07:27.889
Diane, they here yet?

07:31.822 --> 07:32.687
Please.

07:34.658 --> 07:36.200
Diane, what was that?

07:37.035 --> 07:37.865
Diane.

07:43.625 --> 07:46.542
Oh please!

07:50.173 --> 07:52.498
Don't! / No!

07:52.508 --> 07:55.130
No!

08:01.308 --> 08:05.176
John. John! Honey.

08:05.187 --> 08:06.562
Honey. Honey.

08:10.484 --> 08:11.859
Oh, my God!

08:20.285 --> 08:21.945
Stay with Daniel, honey.

08:28.794 --> 08:30.573
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

08:30.587 --> 08:31.536
What the hell happened?

08:31.546 --> 08:33.658
I'm gonna have to...

08:33.673 --> 08:35.203
We got three fatalities.

08:35.217 --> 08:35.999
What?

08:36.009 --> 08:39.259
One male, one female, and one child.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.301
Hey, wait a minute, pal. FBI or not...

09:47.244 --> 09:54.326
Sir, CSI needs to finish.
We gotta let them do their thing.

09:54.334 --> 09:59.162
Sir? You gotta clear out of here now.

10:21.985 --> 10:24.192
SAN FRANCISCO
THREE YEARS LATER

10:27.157 --> 10:29.695
CLUB ZERO
YAKUZA DISTRICT

11:40.227 --> 11:42.220
Hey, baby. How're you doing?

12:51.504 --> 12:52.286
Get him!

13:06.769 --> 13:07.599
Kimo!

13:16.862 --> 13:17.608
Kimo!

13:27.664 --> 13:29.288
Daito, heel

13:32.960 --> 13:34.752
What the fuck!

13:57.651 --> 14:00.321
Rogue do you know
what Shiro does to traitors?

14:08.328 --> 14:11.104
Wow! These Japs sure
know how to party, huh?

14:11.122 --> 14:12.949
Yeah. Smells like a deli in here.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.736
Oh, shut up, Gleason.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.411
You see all this ink?

14:16.419 --> 14:17.866
Japanese Yakuza.

14:17.879 --> 14:18.863
Each one of those rings

14:18.880 --> 14:22.035
is supposed to represent
some poor bastard they've killed.

14:22.049 --> 14:24.872
These are some
bad ass characters here.

14:24.886 --> 14:28.290
Yep. What's that make the people
who did this to them?

14:28.305 --> 14:29.468
Make a hole.

14:30.808 --> 14:33.215
Get these people out of here.

14:33.227 --> 14:34.258
And just who the hell are you?

14:34.269 --> 14:35.847
Asian Organized Crime Unit.

14:35.854 --> 14:37.218
We'll be taking over from here.

14:37.231 --> 14:38.345
On whose authority?

14:38.357 --> 14:39.507
Mayor. President.

14:39.524 --> 14:40.900
Take your pick.

14:42.277 --> 14:45.266
- You don't look very Asian to me.
- You know,

14:45.280 --> 14:48.055
I'm amazed you two don't have
this whole case wrapped up by now.

14:48.074 --> 14:49.687
Check these yet, Einstein?

14:49.701 --> 14:51.894
Yeah. Someone cut the feeds.
There's nothing on there.

14:51.911 --> 14:57.784
Agent Crawford found these
in the back room.

14:57.793 --> 14:59.785
We found him hiding
underneath one of the dead bodies.

14:59.795 --> 15:01.242
He's in pretty bad shape.

15:01.254 --> 15:02.867
Yeah, what's he been saying?

15:02.881 --> 15:04.410
You're kidding me, right?

15:04.424 --> 15:06.286
Who can understand that shit?

15:06.301 --> 15:08.377
Some people come into this country...

15:08.386 --> 15:11.078
you'd think they'd at least
learn to speak American.

15:11.097 --> 15:12.876
You'd think a couple of cops
working a district

15:12.890 --> 15:16.959
that's crawling with Yakuza
might learn to speak a little Japanese.

15:16.978 --> 15:18.804
If they weren't complete fucking idiots.

15:20.189 --> 15:21.849
Give me a minute here would you?

15:26.403 --> 15:31.350
Hi. I'm a cop. What happened here?

15:31.366 --> 15:36.361
Know what I do when I'm not a cop?
I play doctor.

15:38.790 --> 15:41.115
Hey! You can't do that.

15:41.125 --> 15:45.111
If I don't get this shrapnel out

15:45.129 --> 15:46.921
it will get infected.

15:51.052 --> 15:55.512
I got it. No, it's a bone. Sorry.

15:57.307 --> 15:59.252
If you want me
to go back to my day job...

15:59.268 --> 16:01.556
Give me something to do!

16:04.272 --> 16:09.267
I want to die before he comes back.

16:15.743 --> 16:16.608
Well...

16:17.119 --> 16:19.978
I can see it's gonna be
a real picnic working with you.

16:19.997 --> 16:21.989
You're not working with me.

16:21.999 --> 16:25.070
This is the FBI's case now.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.418
You want to help,
take my shirts to the cleaners.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.240
So what'd he say?

16:33.259 --> 16:35.786
Ah, a bunch of
Japanese mumbo jumbo.

16:35.803 --> 16:37.297
Vengeful spirits.

16:42.768 --> 16:43.764
Ghost stories

17:34.235 --> 17:35.136
Jen?

17:35.152 --> 17:36.849
Yeah, did I wake you?

17:36.862 --> 17:38.689
It's almost nine.

17:38.697 --> 17:41.437
Oh, no,
I was working late last night, that's all.

17:41.450 --> 17:43.277
Oh, well, I just called to remind you

17:43.285 --> 17:46.773
that it's Daniel's first
basketball game this Friday.

17:46.788 --> 17:48.651
You forgot, didn't you?

17:48.665 --> 17:50.492
No.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.816
- I've just been tied up with work.
- See ya.

17:51.835 --> 17:53.779
I've got a lot on my mind right now.

17:53.795 --> 17:55.657
Yeah, so what's it this time?

17:55.672 --> 17:56.988
I've found him, Jen.

17:57.006 --> 17:58.370
Found who?

17:58.383 --> 18:00.340
The guy who killed Tom.

18:01.844 --> 18:02.959
He's back.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.879
I can feel it.

18:04.889 --> 18:06.585
This time I'm taking him down.

18:06.599 --> 18:09.255
John, it's been three years.

18:09.268 --> 18:12.471
Look, your obsession with
this man has cost you our marriage.

18:12.479 --> 18:15.338
Don't lose your son.

18:15.357 --> 18:16.970
Tell Daniel I'll be there.

18:16.984 --> 18:19.095
No, you tell him!

18:19.111 --> 18:21.317
And if you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.

18:46.470 --> 18:49.840
Those of you who didn't get to meet
last night, this is Agent Goi.

18:49.849 --> 18:51.640
Just graduated Quantico.

18:53.811 --> 18:54.842
What's his specs?

18:54.854 --> 18:56.134
Oxford.

18:57.106 --> 18:59.134
What's so funny?

18:59.150 --> 19:01.308
In other words, you're a spectator.

19:01.318 --> 19:02.184
What about you?

19:02.194 --> 19:03.937
D.T.

19:03.946 --> 19:05.428
Defensive Tactics.

19:05.447 --> 19:06.313
That's right.

19:06.323 --> 19:08.232
I like to get up close and personal.

19:08.242 --> 19:10.318
Yeah, well, my gun's bigger than yours.

19:10.327 --> 19:12.189
Pick a desk.

19:12.204 --> 19:15.026
Still getting set up here ourselves.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.151
The back of the bus.

19:17.167 --> 19:20.986
These are all the photos
anybody has of Rogue.

19:21.004 --> 19:24.455
Bastard re-cuts his face
every six months.

19:24.465 --> 19:28.368
Come on, John, anybody can use
titanium shells and DU bullets.

19:28.386 --> 19:29.251
The ones we found-

19:29.262 --> 19:33.639
The ones we found last night matched
the ones we found three years ago.

19:35.434 --> 19:36.762
Rogue's back.

19:37.728 --> 19:41.844
Okay, but if he works for the Yakuza
why would he kill Yakuza?

19:41.857 --> 19:43.553
Maybe he switched sides.

19:43.567 --> 19:44.681
Wouldn't be the first time.

19:44.693 --> 19:47.764
What sides are we talking about?

19:47.779 --> 19:50.056
Shiro Yanagawa.

19:50.073 --> 19:52.184
Fronts all Yakuza activity from Japan.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.228
Probably the most
powerful man in San Francisco

19:54.244 --> 19:57.695
and yet he's never even
set foot on American soil.

19:57.705 --> 20:00.481
He's half the reason this task force
was put together.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.982
Li Chang is the other half.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.828
Unlike Shiro, Chang lives here.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.995
Nice big mansion in Marin.

20:06.006 --> 20:08.283
Thinks he's J.D. Rockefeller
or something.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.411
He's a Four-Eighty-Nine.

20:10.427 --> 20:11.874
Triad boss.

20:11.886 --> 20:16.215
Into everything. Bribery, extortion,
murder, you name it.

20:16.224 --> 20:18.964
But years ago
Shiro butchered Chang's family.

20:18.976 --> 20:20.969
Actually had the balls
to fly over to Hong Kong,

20:20.978 --> 20:22.923
and wipe out the whole fucking clan.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.931
He spent the next thirty years
selling every

20:24.940 --> 20:27.431
every heirloom in Chang Dynasty
to collectors' museums.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.099
All that's left now is a couple of horses.

20:30.112 --> 20:33.101
Statuettes. Two of them.
About this big.

20:33.115 --> 20:36.649
Word on the street is that Shiro is
looking for a buyer as we speak.

20:36.660 --> 20:40.397
Chang's loss of honor
means more than his financial loss.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.322
I don't care about the losses.

20:42.332 --> 20:45.321
I don't care about blood lines
or ancient family feuds.

20:45.335 --> 20:48.538
The first time in three years
we got a real shot at getting Rogue.

20:48.546 --> 20:52.757
All we have to do, ladies and
gentlemen, is pull the fucking trigger.

21:51.357 --> 21:54.939
CHANG MANSION
MARIN COUNTY, CA

22:08.289 --> 22:11.326
She's a very rare breed.

22:12.251 --> 22:16.498
Andalusian. That's my wife, Maria.

22:18.049 --> 22:22.295
In my father's day, such a union
would not have been possible.

22:22.303 --> 22:28.506
But times change. Those of us
who change with it survive.

22:28.517 --> 22:29.466
Come.

22:30.978 --> 22:34.014
I am really impressed, Mr Shaw.

22:34.022 --> 22:37.854
Now that you have spilled
the blood of my enemies...

22:39.695 --> 22:43.278
let's drink to our new partnership.

22:48.370 --> 22:49.829
I have to admit...

22:51.665 --> 22:56.789
I was somewhat skeptical when you
first came to me with your proposal.

22:59.380 --> 23:05.501
By leaving Shiro's service
that was a wise move on your part.

23:05.511 --> 23:08.085
But it makes me wonder.

23:08.097 --> 23:13.802
How could one truly trust a man
who has betrayed his master?

23:13.811 --> 23:17.725
I have no master.
So I have betrayed no one.

23:18.982 --> 23:25.234
So, tell me my Horses?
They arrive tonight?

23:28.241 --> 23:31.396
It's been thirty years.

23:31.411 --> 23:35.563
All this time my family
has lived in shame and dishonor.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.618
All because of Shiro's treachery.

23:38.626 --> 23:42.030
Tonight, I will take back
what was stolen from my family...

23:42.046 --> 23:44.738
and everything
will change from here on.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.754
Shiro's men will protect his
treasure with their lives.

23:50.387 --> 23:54.206
Are you certain you can deliver them?

23:54.224 --> 23:57.001
I said I would.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.510
These two are the Ti brothers.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.764
They will give you everything you need.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.026
I'll be in touch.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.788
Watch him closely.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.068
SHIRO'S ESTATE
YAKUZA COMPOUND

24:22.085 --> 24:24.374
TO-DAI, JAPAN

24:52.405 --> 24:53.520
I beg your forgiveness.

24:59.620 --> 25:02.574
The fault is not yours, but mine.

25:02.582 --> 25:04.539
I left myself unguarded.

25:20.141 --> 25:22.632
I trust you have
news from San Francisco...

25:22.643 --> 25:26.344
Yes, everything is
proceeding as requested.

25:26.355 --> 25:27.304
...and the Horses?

25:27.314 --> 25:28.797
We've shipped them out.

25:28.816 --> 25:32.054
They will arrive
in San Francisco tonight.

25:32.069 --> 25:35.557
You must return to San Francisco
in advance of my arrival.

25:35.572 --> 25:37.648
But, Father...

25:37.658 --> 25:42.023
I don't trust our people there.

25:42.037 --> 25:45.441
They have become
too lazy to be useful.

25:45.457 --> 25:51.162
I was hoping to stay here
and further my role in the clan.

25:51.170 --> 25:56.200
Nothing in the history of our clan
has ever been more important.

25:56.217 --> 25:58.660
I will not fail you.

25:58.678 --> 26:02.093
Go now.
Oversee the sale of the Horses.

26:11.273 --> 26:13.977
CHINA TOWN
SAN FRANCISCO

26:33.378 --> 26:35.489
Hey, what's up, dude?

26:35.505 --> 26:37.414
I need to see Benny.

26:37.424 --> 26:38.966
No Bennys here.

26:49.352 --> 26:50.347
Again!

26:52.313 --> 26:53.641
What are you doing?

26:54.064 --> 26:55.677
No!

26:55.691 --> 26:56.437
Yeah!

26:56.734 --> 26:58.144
Again!

26:58.569 --> 27:01.178
Come one. Oww! Ooh!

27:01.196 --> 27:02.394
Hey, babe.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.142
We need to talk.

27:08.161 --> 27:10.901
Cabron, I don't talk to the Feds.

27:10.914 --> 27:12.159
Go!

27:13.291 --> 27:15.118
Somewhere private.

27:15.877 --> 27:16.790
Now.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.963
Okay.

27:22.717 --> 27:25.386
My guy's losing anyway, so...

27:32.559 --> 27:34.765
I'm paying for this shit. Come on!

27:47.657 --> 27:49.235
Business is good, I see.

27:49.243 --> 27:52.279
Yeah. So much
for Homeland Security, right?

27:52.287 --> 27:53.734
So how's the family?

27:53.747 --> 27:56.867
Daniel's fine. But Jen.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.488
That's another story.

27:58.501 --> 28:01.491
Yeah, I really like her. I mean,
how could you fuck that up?

28:01.504 --> 28:03.663
Well, it wasn't hard.

28:03.673 --> 28:06.828
By the way, thanks for that out there.

28:06.843 --> 28:07.827
Made me look good.

28:07.844 --> 28:10.453
Well, hope it helps.

28:10.471 --> 28:11.669
Yeah, well, the people I'm tracking,

28:11.681 --> 28:14.456
they expect the FBI
to pay me some visits like this.

28:14.475 --> 28:15.755
Makes me look legit.

28:15.768 --> 28:17.677
Was that in the Interpol handbook?

28:17.686 --> 28:21.470
Come on, John, there no science
to catching crooks you know that.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.178
Yeah. You said
you had something for me.

28:23.192 --> 28:24.057
Yeah.

28:26.945 --> 28:28.523
Our friend over in Brussels,

28:28.530 --> 28:31.151
the guy that makes
those titanium bullets

28:32.867 --> 28:34.943
found him two days ago.

28:34.953 --> 28:35.902
Then I ran a check.

28:35.912 --> 28:40.123
It seems everyone associated
with Rogue is having some bad luck.

28:43.044 --> 28:44.491
Just last week...

28:44.503 --> 28:46.200
plastic surgeon down in Panama
accidentally impaled himself...

28:46.213 --> 28:50.827
with a kitchen knife
making a turkey sandwich.

28:50.843 --> 28:53.962
Week before that another one of our
scalpel friends down in Florida

28:53.971 --> 28:56.877
went skinny-dipping with some gators.

28:56.890 --> 29:01.172
Guess he didn't read the signs. Anyway.

29:01.186 --> 29:06.050
These guys, they both
specialize in facial reconstruction.

29:06.067 --> 29:07.477
Both of them.

29:09.653 --> 29:11.480
Our man's tying up loose ends.

29:11.488 --> 29:14.098
Yeah, well there's another surgeon
unaccounted for.

29:14.116 --> 29:17.271
Think he might be still alive,
maybe hiding out.

29:17.286 --> 29:19.978
You let me know
the second he surfaces.

29:19.996 --> 29:21.407
Right. Thanks Benny.

29:30.923 --> 29:33.296
Button up, this isn't a disco.

29:37.221 --> 29:38.501
Is that our contact?

29:40.182 --> 29:41.926
Yes my contact.

29:47.314 --> 29:49.141
Get rid of him.

29:49.149 --> 29:50.928
He's my brother. He's with me.

29:50.942 --> 29:53.268
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

29:57.991 --> 29:59.355
Go back to your car.

29:59.367 --> 30:01.858
Wu, please. He's an outsider.

30:01.869 --> 30:04.621
Go! Don't make me say it again.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.885
After this is done
you and I are going to talk.

30:27.562 --> 30:31.808
The Horses are intact.
Shiro will be pleased.

30:31.816 --> 30:35.019
We will contact you when we get there.

30:46.705 --> 30:49.314
Are the Horses safe with this crew?

30:49.332 --> 30:52.582
Of, course, as far as they know
they're just delivering cars.

31:34.709 --> 31:36.487
Stay calm and cooperate.

31:36.502 --> 31:38.625
It's just a routine check.

31:45.428 --> 31:46.958
I need you out of the car, both of you.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.549
Put your hands where I can see them.

31:48.556 --> 31:51.248
Officer, we're with
Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises.

31:51.267 --> 31:52.631
You are making a huge mistake.

31:52.643 --> 31:53.793
We have made arrangements.

31:53.811 --> 31:55.091
Out of the car!

32:03.028 --> 32:04.688
Do it. Turn around.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.769
We work security.

32:08.784 --> 32:11.524
We have licenses to carry firearms.
Call your Captain.

32:11.536 --> 32:14.288
- Shut up. Shut up.
- He'll vouch for us.

32:16.457 --> 32:18.367
- Fucking rent a cops.
- Shut up.

32:23.798 --> 32:24.699
Good evening.

32:24.715 --> 32:27.787
Captain Andrews,
what the fuck is going on?

32:27.802 --> 32:30.209
What about our arrangement?

32:30.221 --> 32:35.381
Just a little change in plan.
I need my money. Now.

32:46.444 --> 32:49.220
So, we are good to go?

32:49.239 --> 32:51.646
Oh, yeah. You're good to go.

32:51.658 --> 32:56.105
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.

32:56.120 --> 32:56.950
Let's go.

32:57.705 --> 32:58.571
Do it.

32:59.916 --> 33:01.944
Mr. Chang sends his regards.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.123
No-o-o!

33:21.604 --> 33:24.972
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

34:08.648 --> 34:10.853
Compliments of Mr. Chang.

34:47.561 --> 34:50.384
Some serious shit here, brother.

34:50.397 --> 34:53.089
Yakuzas. All of them.

34:53.108 --> 34:57.355
All lined up, shot through the back.
Execution-style.

34:57.362 --> 35:01.775
Excuse me, Forensics wants to know if
you're ready for them to come in yet.

35:09.165 --> 35:10.825
It was a heist.

35:10.833 --> 35:13.027
What?

35:13.044 --> 35:15.997
Check the space between these sedans.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.659
These guys were
escorting something big.

35:19.675 --> 35:22.380
Whatever it was,
it must have been important.

35:25.514 --> 35:28.550
These guys were the guard dogs.

35:28.558 --> 35:30.835
But they left their guns in the cars.

35:30.852 --> 35:35.266
There's only one thing that would stop
these guys from throwing down.

35:35.274 --> 35:37.219
Cops.

35:37.234 --> 35:39.677
At least they thought they were cops.

35:39.695 --> 35:43.443
Hold on just a damn minute. Are you
trying to say that cops did this?

35:45.242 --> 35:46.985
If they didn't, they were involved.

35:46.993 --> 35:48.986
No fucking way!

35:48.995 --> 35:51.747
For all we know
it could have been one of you guys.

36:35.289 --> 36:39.702
I'm assuming that
you know who the fuck I am.

36:39.710 --> 36:42.996
You're a bitch for Shiro Yanagawa
aren't you, Captain?

36:43.005 --> 36:47.667
You're the one who gives his boys
free passage to smuggle in shit.

36:47.676 --> 36:50.287
And you're the one
who sold them out last night.

36:50.305 --> 36:53.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:53.099 --> 36:54.558
I've never met Yana...

36:59.313 --> 37:00.547
Hey-hey-hey-hey.

37:00.564 --> 37:02.058
This is a Federal matter.

37:08.030 --> 37:11.932
Look at it. Look down the barrel.

37:11.950 --> 37:14.026
Tell me if you see the bullet.

37:14.035 --> 37:16.028
- Can you see it?
- I see it.

37:18.456 --> 37:20.318
He said he'll kill me.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.610
He said he'll kill my family.

37:22.627 --> 37:23.445
Who?

37:23.461 --> 37:24.944
Who said that?

37:24.962 --> 37:26.492
I don't know who!

37:26.506 --> 37:28.119
Who?

37:28.132 --> 37:31.869
I don't know who. He's with the Triads.

37:31.886 --> 37:33.333
He works for the Changs.

37:33.345 --> 37:34.579
He knows where I live.

37:34.597 --> 37:37.004
He knows where my kids go to school.

37:42.938 --> 37:45.630
You stupid bastard.

37:45.649 --> 37:47.345
What do you think
Shiro Yanagawa's gonna do

37:47.359 --> 37:49.316
when he finds out you fucked him?

38:01.789 --> 38:04.150
Get a statement. Call the marshals.

38:04.166 --> 38:07.618
Put his family under protective custody.

38:07.629 --> 38:09.538
Down, down, down! Everyone down!

38:09.547 --> 38:11.006
A shooter on the! Roof!

38:14.969 --> 38:15.918
Guys!

38:34.613 --> 38:36.142
This is Agent Wick.

38:36.156 --> 38:37.436
I need Chase Squad backup

38:37.449 --> 38:39.856
and an ambulance
to Sloan's Steakhouse. Now!

38:41.661 --> 38:43.120
Hang on, motherfucker.

39:41.594 --> 39:42.459
Nothing!

39:46.682 --> 39:48.057
This motherfucker's out.

40:04.824 --> 40:07.683
YAKUZA HEADQUARTERS
SAN FRANCISCO

40:07.702 --> 40:10.525
The Triads made us look like fools.

40:10.538 --> 40:14.073
Kill. Kill them.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.910
Give me the word...

40:15.918 --> 40:18.243
...and I'll make them disappear.

40:18.254 --> 40:20.994
Do it. Find them.

40:21.006 --> 40:25.039
I want all the heads
of every one of them.

40:25.052 --> 40:29.299
Nobody told me
you two were in charge now.

40:29.306 --> 40:31.464
Kira-san. Welcome home.

40:31.475 --> 40:33.918
Your presence honors us.

40:33.935 --> 40:38.846
And your stupidity insults my father.

40:38.857 --> 40:40.564
We were just discussing...

40:42.486 --> 40:45.606
I've brought word from Shiro directly.

40:45.614 --> 40:48.057
You are to do nothing
until he instructs you to.

40:48.075 --> 40:50.435
The Horses have been stolen!

40:50.452 --> 40:52.610
If we do not strike back...

40:55.457 --> 40:58.411
Are you disobeying my father?

41:03.756 --> 41:08.169
Good. I'd like a salad.

41:11.138 --> 41:14.542
I just got off a fourteen hour flight.

41:14.558 --> 41:16.930
I'd like a salad.

41:20.606 --> 41:22.764
Will somebody get me a salad?

41:22.774 --> 41:25.858
What What kind?

41:30.198 --> 41:34.231
Chef. No blue cheese.

41:34.243 --> 41:37.102
No blue cheese.

41:37.121 --> 41:38.319
Takada...

41:51.385 --> 41:55.003
With dressing on the side, please.

41:56.765 --> 41:57.796
Hai.

42:00.227 --> 42:01.141
Bitch.

42:12.614 --> 42:13.528
Yeah.

42:13.991 --> 42:16.683
Special Agent Crawford.

42:16.701 --> 42:17.567
Who is this?

42:17.577 --> 42:19.190
A messenger.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.196
A messenger, huh?

42:21.206 --> 42:24.277
The police captain in the restaurant,
was he part of your message?

42:24.292 --> 42:25.775
He was a crooked cop.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.905
I just did what you want to do.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.826
What the hell do you know about
what I want, you fuck?

42:30.840 --> 42:33.532
I saw it in your eyes, John.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.876
Yeah, what did you see?

42:35.886 --> 42:39.966
Pain. Rage. Loneliness.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.796
I'll tell you what,

42:43.810 --> 42:46.136
why don't we meet at
my shrink's office and discuss it.

42:46.146 --> 42:48.257
You want the stolen shipment?

42:48.273 --> 42:51.856
Warehouse Sixteen. One hour.

43:01.577 --> 43:03.451
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

43:11.462 --> 43:12.493
This is the FBI.

43:12.504 --> 43:15.375
Remain where you are and keep
your hands above your heads.

43:21.055 --> 43:23.498
What? Not happy to see us?

43:23.516 --> 43:25.544
This is private property.

43:25.559 --> 43:28.726
RSVP. We came to party, baby.

43:32.983 --> 43:38.060
Li Chang.
You still pretending to be legit?

43:38.071 --> 43:43.527
Watch your mouth.
You forget who you're talking to here.

43:47.455 --> 43:48.570
Open it.

43:51.876 --> 43:54.331
I said, open it.

43:55.755 --> 43:56.750
Open it!

44:11.186 --> 44:13.344
Put your hands
on the back of your head.

44:15.857 --> 44:17.731
Now, motherfucker.

44:22.572 --> 44:24.399
Get your fucking hands up.

44:33.791 --> 44:35.286
No weapons. He's clean.

44:39.506 --> 44:41.048
Victor Shaw.

44:41.966 --> 44:45.999
So that's what
you call yourself now huh?

44:46.012 --> 44:50.757
Hong Kong passport but
security license out of Tokyo. Fine.

44:52.101 --> 44:54.592
Check the warehouse.
Make sure nothing's hidden.

44:57.272 --> 44:59.633
It's you, isn't it?

44:59.650 --> 45:02.223
I remember your eyes.

45:02.235 --> 45:05.022
There's something
real familiar about them.

45:08.742 --> 45:11.980
It's the one thing the surgeons
can't change, can they?

45:11.995 --> 45:13.275
The eyes.

45:15.289 --> 45:19.157
They did a helluva job
on the rest of you, though.

45:19.168 --> 45:21.789
Wouldn't even know
you're the same man.

45:24.882 --> 45:29.342
But you are, aren't you?
I know you are.

45:35.475 --> 45:38.844
So what's the Yakuza hit man doing
working for the Triads?

45:42.941 --> 45:44.933
I know you understand me.

45:47.070 --> 45:49.276
It was you on the phone, wasn't it?

45:53.035 --> 45:55.193
What, don't remember?

45:55.203 --> 45:57.243
Maybe you remember my partner.

45:59.291 --> 46:00.915
You do, don't you?

46:02.669 --> 46:07.461
Remember his name? Tom Lone.

46:09.967 --> 46:12.126
Remember his wife, Diane?

46:13.679 --> 46:16.371
His four-year-old daughter, Amy?

46:16.390 --> 46:18.679
Remember a cabin in the woods.

46:19.810 --> 46:26.180
A cabin that you burned to the ground
with their bodies still inside?

46:26.191 --> 46:28.053
Remember that?

46:28.068 --> 46:29.941
Do you remember that?

46:31.529 --> 46:36.868
Say it. Say it. Say you remember.

46:37.994 --> 46:43.866
Say you fucking remember blowing
my partner's goddamn head off!

46:43.874 --> 46:47.492
You will find only pain,
living in the past.

46:47.503 --> 46:50.160
Crawford, there's nothing here.
He checks out.

46:50.172 --> 46:54.371
It's him, Terry. I fucking know it.

46:54.384 --> 47:01.300
So what if it is? Hm?
Look, right now we got nothing.

47:01.308 --> 47:06.171
Come on, man,
it'll be another day. All right?

47:06.187 --> 47:12.522
But right now we wait.
We play it smart. And we do it right.

47:21.036 --> 47:22.150
Another day.

47:24.372 --> 47:27.693
Another day you and I
are going to finish this.

47:27.709 --> 47:29.582
Count on that.

47:31.170 --> 47:32.664
Everyone move out.

47:45.976 --> 47:49.427
How in the world
did you know the FBI were coming?

47:51.440 --> 47:53.468
Experience.

47:53.483 --> 47:57.600
You have impressed me
once again, my friend.

47:57.612 --> 48:02.606
As you see,
the FBI has declared war on us.

48:02.617 --> 48:04.064
Well, fuck them!

48:04.077 --> 48:06.567
I trust you have secured my Horses?

48:06.579 --> 48:08.607
They are safe.

48:08.623 --> 48:12.655
I still have a lot of work
for you to do, my friend.

48:12.668 --> 48:16.037
I think you'd better
stay in my house for a while.

48:16.046 --> 48:18.086
Keep an eye on things.

48:20.676 --> 48:22.158
Understood.

48:22.177 --> 48:23.340
Oh, Victor.

48:24.513 --> 48:28.891
This FBI guy, Crawford, he is trouble.

48:29.977 --> 48:31.519
He's chasing ghosts.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.495
Give me a new one.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.116
I said put up a new one now!

49:54.892 --> 49:55.638
Mommy.

50:21.751 --> 50:23.660
Did I scare you?

50:25.004 --> 50:26.072
Where is the mother?

50:26.088 --> 50:28.923
Do you want to play?
We could play tag.

50:29.466 --> 50:30.700
Go find your mother.

50:30.718 --> 50:32.544
I have things to do.

50:32.553 --> 50:33.833
What's that?

50:37.724 --> 50:39.551
Wow! Do it again.

50:40.727 --> 50:42.007
Ana.

50:42.020 --> 50:44.178
He's showing me a magic trick.

50:44.189 --> 50:46.300
Why don't you go downstairs
and play for Mommy.

50:46.316 --> 50:48.509
But we were playing.

50:48.526 --> 50:50.887
I know but I'll be downstairs
in just a minute, okay?

50:50.903 --> 50:52.066
Bye.

50:56.325 --> 50:58.982
I understand you have business here

50:58.994 --> 51:01.521
but I am warning you
to stay away from Ana.

51:01.538 --> 51:05.158
My husband's work and our family
are two separate things.

51:05.168 --> 51:07.326
Do we understand each other?

51:07.337 --> 51:09.210
Yes, Mrs. Chang.

51:10.590 --> 51:11.503
Good.

51:26.230 --> 51:30.049
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

51:30.067 --> 51:34.929
Mr. Chang might think
you're his man right now

51:34.946 --> 51:39.572
but I'm still the one
who looks after things around here.

51:40.410 --> 51:43.529
At every moment
in the world things change.

51:56.050 --> 51:57.497
- TRIAD DISTRICT-
Don't make me say it again!

51:57.509 --> 51:59.371
...he fucking tells me.

51:59.386 --> 52:01.592
- Do you know how much-
- Relax.

52:03.849 --> 52:06.458
What the fuck?

52:06.476 --> 52:07.804
Mother fucker!

52:15.360 --> 52:17.518
Fucking Yakuza. Let's go!

52:17.528 --> 52:19.486
...teach that fucking Jap a lesson.

52:40.801 --> 52:42.046
YAKUZA DISTRICT

52:44.638 --> 52:45.967
Triads are coming!

52:50.352 --> 52:51.894
Triad motherfuckers get 'em!

53:08.411 --> 53:09.609
Buddha-heads!

53:14.542 --> 53:15.704
Fucking Yakuza!

53:51.369 --> 53:53.066
You fucking bastard.

53:53.079 --> 53:55.072
I knew we should
never have trusted you.

54:27.987 --> 54:29.398
Subtle, ain't it?

54:30.365 --> 54:33.401
It's got Shiro's trademark.

54:33.409 --> 54:34.524
So what now?

54:34.535 --> 54:36.362
Get ready for a war.

54:42.001 --> 54:45.037
Joey Ti. Got your ass.

54:45.045 --> 54:47.904
Park, I want you outside
Chang's place in Marin.

54:47.923 --> 54:50.034
Daniels, you get Yanagawa Motors.

54:50.050 --> 54:52.375
Kinler, you get Warehouse sixteen.

54:52.385 --> 54:55.707
Wick, take Goi.
Keep an eye on the Sayu Teahouse.

54:55.723 --> 54:57.300
I get the new guy, huh?

54:57.308 --> 54:59.135
I think I know
how to look through a night scope.

54:59.143 --> 55:00.293
Hey, eyes open, everybody.

55:00.311 --> 55:01.425
The shit's gonna go down somewhere.

55:01.437 --> 55:03.050
Be ready to move
when you get the call.

55:03.063 --> 55:05.340
Binoculars. No night scope.

55:05.357 --> 55:08.560
The authorities are
expecting us to retaliate.

55:08.568 --> 55:10.395
We strike now, we risk everything!

55:10.404 --> 55:12.100
What if it was your family?

55:12.113 --> 55:14.272
What the fuck is wrong with you?

55:14.282 --> 55:18.267
You forgot?
Once it was my family.

55:18.286 --> 55:20.693
Joey was like a son to me.

55:21.998 --> 55:24.441
Revenge is a must.

55:24.459 --> 55:26.652
But you've got to learn to be patient.

55:26.669 --> 55:31.414
I will allow nothing
to put our family at risk.

55:31.423 --> 55:34.246
I want you to do nothing.

55:34.259 --> 55:35.457
Is that clear?

55:52.944 --> 55:56.562
Shiro knows his days
are coming to an end.

55:57.740 --> 56:00.065
One thing's for sure...

56:00.076 --> 56:03.990
more blood will be spilled
before this is over.

56:05.414 --> 56:06.789
Mr. Shaw...

56:08.208 --> 56:12.752
I want your word that my wife
and daughter will be safe.

56:14.841 --> 56:16.584
No harm will come to them.

56:27.436 --> 56:29.891
A man should never give up his honor.

56:33.692 --> 56:36.064
Or the honor of his family.

56:43.826 --> 56:44.989
Keep them.

56:46.412 --> 56:47.408
I don't smoke.

56:59.216 --> 57:01.255
SAYU TEA HOUSE

57:09.684 --> 57:11.760
SAYU TEA HOUSE
YAKUZA DISTRICT

57:18.985 --> 57:21.641
Oh, man!

57:21.654 --> 57:24.097
I didn't know your mama
was working tonight.

57:24.115 --> 57:26.191
Keep your eye on the mark, Goi.

57:31.331 --> 57:32.529
Yo, heads up!

57:34.417 --> 57:37.169
Looks like Takada's having
a little tea party, huh?

58:05.989 --> 58:07.780
Have some spicy tuna.

58:19.502 --> 58:21.280
Shit! Get Crawford and call for backup!

58:21.295 --> 58:22.493
It's going down now!

58:28.927 --> 58:30.410
Crawford.

58:30.429 --> 58:31.294
We got trouble.

58:31.304 --> 58:33.048
Wu just showed up just like you said.

58:33.056 --> 58:33.921
I'm on my way.

58:33.932 --> 58:35.212
Copy that.

58:59.499 --> 59:00.281
Get down!

59:20.686 --> 59:22.263
I'm going in. Cover me.

59:44.542 --> 59:46.155
This is for my brother.

59:46.168 --> 59:48.125
He's dead! Come on!

01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:04.675
On three.

01:00:04.812 --> 01:00:05.879
What?

01:00:05.896 --> 01:00:06.880
Three!

01:00:06.897 --> 01:00:08.060
Oh! Shit!

01:00:16.323 --> 01:00:16.939
Wick!

01:00:17.365 --> 01:00:18.029
Shit!

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.200
FBI. Drop your weapons.

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:28.239
Drop your weapons!

01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:30.160
Hands on the counter
where I can see them.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:33.168
Closer.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:40.467
Situation secure.
All units stand down and cease fire.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:46.305
Damnit, Goi!
He said cease fucking fire!

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:49.683
Shit.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.514
Look. Goi's right there.

01:00:52.524 --> 01:00:54.018
We got a shooter guys.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:00.735
I got him!

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.705
Don't fucking move!

01:01:15.754 --> 01:01:16.833
Get the other one!

01:02:28.657 --> 01:02:29.938
Fuck you!

01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:39.286
In Japan! You'd be dead!

01:02:43.005 --> 01:02:44.548
This isn't Japan.

01:05:07.477 --> 01:05:09.054
I said no. No-no-no.

01:05:11.355 --> 01:05:12.589
Yes.

01:05:12.607 --> 01:05:16.641
Wu and his boys shot up
Takada's teahouse last night.

01:05:16.653 --> 01:05:18.136
What?

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:22.733
Wu Ti? Uh, are you sure?

01:05:22.742 --> 01:05:23.857
I tried to stop them.

01:05:23.868 --> 01:05:28.731
Goddamnit!
I told him not to do anything.

01:05:28.748 --> 01:05:30.575
He leaves me with no choice.

01:05:41.385 --> 01:05:45.548
You've done well.
My father is very pleased.

01:05:49.434 --> 01:05:52.293
He now asks one more thing of you.

01:05:52.312 --> 01:05:56.511
After I kill Chang
his operation will be destroyed.

01:05:56.524 --> 01:05:58.564
What more could Shiro want?

01:06:01.612 --> 01:06:04.020
The heads of the wife and child.

01:06:05.366 --> 01:06:06.397
Why?

01:06:07.576 --> 01:06:08.976
That's the order.

01:06:08.994 --> 01:06:10.477
There is no why.

01:06:10.496 --> 01:06:15.158
You never had a problem
killing women and children before.

01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:18.536
Would you dare disobey your master?

01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:22.199
I have no master.

01:06:22.215 --> 01:06:24.540
These are my guards.

01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:28.418
They will assist you on this task
as you best decide.

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:29.924
If I refuse?

01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:40.972
You dropped this.

01:06:48.158 --> 01:06:50.186
What is happening, John?

01:06:50.201 --> 01:06:53.107
There are men with guns
in my front yard.

01:06:53.121 --> 01:06:54.520
Just a precaution.

01:06:54.539 --> 01:06:56.864
A precaution? For what?

01:06:56.874 --> 01:06:59.697
What've you gotten us into?

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.738
Oh, my God.

01:07:01.754 --> 01:07:04.327
It's him. Isn't it?
He's coming after us.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.917
That's not gonna happen.

01:07:14.474 --> 01:07:16.502
I'm sorry, Jen.

01:07:16.518 --> 01:07:19.269
Not just for this. For everything.

01:07:20.313 --> 01:07:23.053
I tried to do the right thing.

01:07:23.066 --> 01:07:25.592
Make a good life for you and Daniel.

01:07:25.610 --> 01:07:27.887
To give you the things you needed.

01:07:27.904 --> 01:07:31.853
It never had anything to do
with what we did or didn't have.

01:07:31.866 --> 01:07:33.265
It was the job.

01:07:33.284 --> 01:07:35.395
The job always came first, even now.

01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:37.818
Even knowing you might be
putting us in the same danger

01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:39.787
Tom and his family were in.

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:50.866
You know...

01:07:50.885 --> 01:07:54.254
I'm not even mad at you anymore.

01:07:54.263 --> 01:07:57.217
Most days I just feel sorry for you.

01:07:57.224 --> 01:07:58.967
For what you've become.

01:08:01.395 --> 01:08:02.557
It's Benny.

01:08:04.064 --> 01:08:06.021
Say hi to Benny for me.

01:08:14.741 --> 01:08:16.567
What've you got, Benny?

01:08:16.576 --> 01:08:18.935
We found your plastic surgeon.

01:08:18.953 --> 01:08:19.783
Tijuana Mexico

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:41.665
Welcome home, Dr. Sherman.

01:08:41.683 --> 01:08:43.675
Hey Jefe, what's cooking?

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:45.511
Step in here.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.346
Let's have a talk. Come on.

01:08:51.609 --> 01:08:52.889
Agent Crawford, is that?

01:08:52.902 --> 01:08:54.265
I don't-I don't-I don't know anything.

01:08:54.278 --> 01:08:55.475
Really. I don't know anything.

01:08:55.488 --> 01:08:56.389
Doc!

01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:57.473
Come on, you kidding me?

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.723
Can you explain to me

01:08:58.741 --> 01:09:00.982
why one of the world's most
brilliant nip-and-tuckers

01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:02.819
is hiding out in the slums of Mexico?

01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:04.904
What are you,
a fucking Nazi war criminal?

01:09:04.912 --> 01:09:05.399
Look, I were you,

01:09:05.415 --> 01:09:08.368
I'd be lapping up that pussy
on South Beach stretching it out.

01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:09.787
Come on, now.

01:09:11.587 --> 01:09:14.029
Look, I could give a shit about
whatever laws you've broken.

01:09:14.048 --> 01:09:16.040
That's not why we're here.

01:09:18.426 --> 01:09:21.416
I need you to identify this man.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.421
You know what happened
to the other two doctors.

01:09:23.432 --> 01:09:25.709
We know you could be next.

01:09:25.725 --> 01:09:26.840
We can protect you.

01:09:26.852 --> 01:09:29.425
You don't know him. Protect me?

01:09:29.438 --> 01:09:31.264
You can't protect me.
You can't stop him.

01:09:31.273 --> 01:09:33.810
You found me here,
he can find me here.

01:09:36.944 --> 01:09:38.059
I can stop him.

01:09:39.822 --> 01:09:43.654
All I need from you is a yes or a no.
Is this Rogue?

01:09:49.665 --> 01:09:51.076
Is this Rogue?

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:54.033
We uh, we-we...

01:09:54.044 --> 01:10:00.698
We used to get uh, commissioned
by the U.S. Government

01:10:00.717 --> 01:10:05.083
and we'd all do our surgeries on him
when he was with the CIA.

01:10:05.096 --> 01:10:07.670
We changed his face a lot of times.

01:10:09.476 --> 01:10:12.631
He, uh he came to me
three years ago.

01:10:12.645 --> 01:10:14.554
His face was almost torn off.

01:10:14.564 --> 01:10:15.382
I just did what I could.

01:10:15.398 --> 01:10:17.225
I repaired the muscle,
the nerve tissue.

01:10:17.233 --> 01:10:19.510
Then I reconstructed the facial bones.

01:10:19.527 --> 01:10:20.937
I never saw him again.

01:10:24.908 --> 01:10:27.577
This is what I made him look like.

01:10:31.748 --> 01:10:33.824
Look, Doc,
we're going to take you with us.

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:37.118
We're going to protect you,
understand?

01:10:37.128 --> 01:10:41.161
Now why don't you go get
somethings together and we'll go.

01:10:41.173 --> 01:10:42.870
Doc!

01:10:42.883 --> 01:10:46.418
What? Yeah. Is it okay if l-if I...

01:10:46.428 --> 01:10:48.255
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Go ahead.

01:10:57.647 --> 01:10:59.058
You believe in fate Benny?

01:11:01.276 --> 01:11:02.355
Fate?

01:11:02.443 --> 01:11:03.688
Yeah.

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:09.268
You know, no matter what you do
your future's already decided?

01:11:09.283 --> 01:11:10.351
I don't know about that.

01:11:10.368 --> 01:11:13.368
I always thought your future
depends on what choices you make.

01:11:31.596 --> 01:11:34.336
I have made all
the necessary arrangements.

01:11:34.349 --> 01:11:36.341
I will join you as soon as I finish here.

01:11:36.351 --> 01:11:37.216
Okay?

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:39.005
Don't worry.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.309
Okay, I'll be back to walk you out.

01:11:42.316 --> 01:11:43.596
I love you.

01:12:25.356 --> 01:12:26.601
My crew's gone.

01:12:28.359 --> 01:12:29.937
My brother is dead.

01:12:29.944 --> 01:12:31.522
You brought it onto yourself.

01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:33.557
And how did I do that?

01:12:33.573 --> 01:12:35.648
I gave you my trust.

01:12:35.658 --> 01:12:37.602
I gave you my loyalty.

01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:41.817
I sacrificed everything for you
and this is how I'm treated?

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:45.698
You've got a lot of nerve
to talk to me about loyalty.

01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:47.203
You're a fucking traitor!

01:12:53.008 --> 01:12:53.754
Die!

01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:08.012
That piece of shit.
He tells me that he's loyal.

01:13:08.899 --> 01:13:10.097
That he's my friend.

01:13:11.276 --> 01:13:13.553
I trusted him.

01:13:13.570 --> 01:13:18.148
He's right. He was loyal.
He was your friend.

01:13:18.157 --> 01:13:18.857
What?

01:13:29.418 --> 01:13:30.248
Shit.

01:13:31.462 --> 01:13:32.612
AOC base from Clark.

01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:35.452
We got some major action
at the Chang mansion.

01:13:35.466 --> 01:13:37.588
What's going on? Is the boss okay?

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:48.301
Mommy loves you, okay. Just...

01:13:54.108 --> 01:13:54.855
No!

01:14:08.914 --> 01:14:11.025
Chang is dead.

01:14:11.041 --> 01:14:13.448
And the woman and child?

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.667
Take me to the bodies
so I can take their heads.

01:14:17.298 --> 01:14:21.426
No. I killed them.
I should have that honor.

01:14:30.227 --> 01:14:31.602
Come on! Kill him!

01:15:03.675 --> 01:15:09.049
Are you okay? Where is my husband?

01:15:45.132 --> 01:15:46.615
Where's Clark?

01:15:46.634 --> 01:15:47.867
He's on his way back.

01:15:47.885 --> 01:15:49.035
He send the photos?

01:15:49.053 --> 01:15:50.251
Yes, sir.

01:15:51.597 --> 01:15:53.423
What the fuck happened up there?

01:15:53.432 --> 01:15:56.919
Looks like Rogue took out Chang and
turned on Shiro's assassins.

01:15:56.935 --> 01:16:00.174
He's using them.
Playing both sets against each other.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.433
Why would he do that?

01:16:03.274 --> 01:16:06.228
John! You're never gonna believe
who just flew in.

01:16:20.082 --> 01:16:23.819
Father, I'm so happy to see you.

01:16:23.836 --> 01:16:26.741
And I am happy to see you.

01:16:26.755 --> 01:16:29.661
This country looks very beautiful.

01:16:29.674 --> 01:16:32.331
Your English is improving.

01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:34.087
I have been practicing.

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:36.135
This is my new home after all.

01:16:38.641 --> 01:16:41.500
Rogue insisted on
delivering the Horses himself.

01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:44.045
You've made me very proud.

01:16:44.063 --> 01:16:47.052
I must ask for one more thing of you.

01:16:47.066 --> 01:16:48.928
Anything.

01:16:48.943 --> 01:16:50.568
Return to Japan.

01:16:51.905 --> 01:16:55.973
But I want to stay with you.

01:16:55.992 --> 01:16:59.028
If I am to oversee our expansion here

01:16:59.037 --> 01:17:02.370
I need someone
who can insure our interests in Japan.

01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:06.865
The only person
I can trust is you, Kira.

01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:09.570
Shiro Yanagawa!

01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:13.206
FBI Special Agent John Crawford.

01:17:13.217 --> 01:17:14.960
Step back

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:18.373
Welcome to America.

01:17:18.388 --> 01:17:22.042
Now don't unpack.
You won't be staying long.

01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:23.422
Agent Crawford...

01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:25.095
I'm a busy man.

01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:28.932
Oh, we got a lot of business,
you and me.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.680
I think you know that.

01:17:31.693 --> 01:17:35.013
Three years ago
Rogue killed my partner and his family.

01:17:35.029 --> 01:17:36.013
And you know what?

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:37.987
Rogue was working for you.

01:17:39.575 --> 01:17:42.315
Rogue is a myth. Just a rumor.

01:17:42.328 --> 01:17:43.656
You think so, huh.

01:17:51.253 --> 01:17:54.324
You can't always trust rumors, can you?

01:17:54.339 --> 01:17:58.705
Rogue turns around and fucking slices
up the heavy hitters you sent with him.

01:17:58.718 --> 01:18:02.288
Now you gotta ask yourself, now
why would he do something like that?

01:18:02.305 --> 01:18:04.712
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

01:18:09.563 --> 01:18:10.677
Look...

01:18:10.897 --> 01:18:14.183
I don't care if you fuckers slaughter
each other till you're all dead and buried.

01:18:14.192 --> 01:18:16.469
Truth is it makes my job a lot easier.

01:18:16.486 --> 01:18:19.937
But if I find proof that
ties any of this shit back to you...

01:18:19.948 --> 01:18:22.902
you ain't never gonna see Japan again.

01:18:22.909 --> 01:18:25.696
And neither will that
pretty little daughter of yours.

01:18:29.081 --> 01:18:30.659
Thanks for the tip

01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:31.864
Agent Crawford.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:29.713
Finally! My most loyal stranger.

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:31.680
We meet face to face.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.563
Yanagawa-san, I've waited
a long time for this moment.

01:19:46.823 --> 01:19:51.769
It's all because of you
that we now have this opportunity.

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:55.735
Kira enjoyed working with you here.

01:19:55.748 --> 01:20:00.659
One day she'll make a fine leader
of Yanagawa clan.

01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:06.790
Yeah, one day.
I'm reminded of the Sengoku...

01:20:08.677 --> 01:20:13.291
when the Daimyo warriors fought
each other to unite Japan.

01:20:13.306 --> 01:20:18.846
The one who finally succeeded was
a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga.

01:20:19.854 --> 01:20:22.464
And do you know how he did it?

01:20:22.482 --> 01:20:25.802
He killed everyone who opposed him.

01:20:25.818 --> 01:20:30.396
Thanks to you all those
who oppose me here are dead.

01:20:30.406 --> 01:20:32.647
I exist but to serve you.

01:20:46.839 --> 01:20:50.089
In Asia these could never be sold.

01:20:51.677 --> 01:20:54.250
But the fortune
they will bring here in the West...

01:20:54.263 --> 01:20:58.379
will be more than enough
to continue our American expansion.

01:20:58.392 --> 01:21:01.630
And now it is time for your reward.

01:21:01.645 --> 01:21:02.724
Open it.

01:21:23.374 --> 01:21:26.529
One must remove all future threats.

01:21:26.543 --> 01:21:31.703
You allowed that threat to remain
by not killing the woman and child.

01:21:35.343 --> 01:21:40.420
You have disobeyed me
and broken my most sacred code.

01:21:40.723 --> 01:21:42.930
Your code, not mine.

01:21:44.894 --> 01:21:49.010
Betrayal cannot be forgiven.

01:21:49.023 --> 01:21:51.466
Take him downstairs.

01:21:51.484 --> 01:21:55.066
Persuade him to tell us
where the wife and child are.

01:22:06.082 --> 01:22:08.370
They are truly magnificent.

01:22:09.919 --> 01:22:13.619
So many dead for such small trinkets.

01:22:17.885 --> 01:22:18.916
Fakes!

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:29.273
Find the woman and child...

01:23:29.287 --> 01:23:31.030
They'll lead us to the real Horses.

01:23:46.637 --> 01:23:47.466
Yanagawa-san!

01:24:25.298 --> 01:24:28.334
After all these years...

01:24:28.343 --> 01:24:31.035
why do you do this?

01:24:31.054 --> 01:24:33.011
You ordered the hit.

01:24:34.892 --> 01:24:38.225
I ordered many hits.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:43.018
This one was different.

01:25:26.566 --> 01:25:30.610
You should have left
the wife and daughter alone.

01:25:59.556 --> 01:26:02.047
I left none to seek revenge.

01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:11.149
You left one!

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.923
Your assassin, Rogue,
never made it out alive.

01:26:52.148 --> 01:26:55.896
So, you are Tom Lone?

01:26:57.361 --> 01:27:01.026
Changing your face, your voice.

01:27:03.408 --> 01:27:05.864
All so you could get to me.

01:27:09.248 --> 01:27:12.866
Pain can be a weapon,
if you so choose.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:22.952
How do you think we found out
you were FBI in the first place?

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.250
It was Crawford.

01:27:34.606 --> 01:27:36.931
You killed my family.

01:27:36.941 --> 01:27:40.939
It was Crawford.
He's the one who gave you up.

01:27:44.949 --> 01:27:47.238
Crawford works for me.

01:27:52.039 --> 01:27:55.906
Because of him your family's dead!

01:27:58.045 --> 01:27:59.527
Somebody talked.

01:27:59.546 --> 01:28:01.669
Inside. Close to us.

01:28:02.007 --> 01:28:04.035
You never know who's working for who.

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:05.379
Somebody talked.

01:28:59.729 --> 01:29:00.844
Crawford?

01:29:03.066 --> 01:29:04.394
Shiro's dead.

01:29:10.281 --> 01:29:12.772
Get out of this business
while you can, Goi.

01:29:57.034 --> 01:29:59.027
Make a New Life...

01:30:21.641 --> 01:30:25.342
From America? Leave me.

01:30:34.945 --> 01:30:36.190
Make a new life...

01:30:58.843 --> 01:30:59.625
Crawford.

01:31:01.138 --> 01:31:03.664
Remember the night we met?

01:31:03.682 --> 01:31:06.255
I remember my partner
blowing your face off.

01:31:06.268 --> 01:31:10.100
You live today
only because of what he did.

01:31:12.315 --> 01:31:15.933
I live today only to kill you,
you miserable prick.

01:31:16.653 --> 01:31:18.562
Meet me there.

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:30.405
Goi

01:31:41.593 --> 01:31:43.004
Where are you?

01:31:43.637 --> 01:31:45.047
Show yourself!

01:31:47.182 --> 01:31:50.681
I got your surgeon.
He made a positive ID.

01:31:54.188 --> 01:31:57.842
Come on, Crawford. Flush him out.

01:31:57.858 --> 01:31:59.483
It's over, Rogue.

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:02.564
Can you hear me?

01:34:01.603 --> 01:34:03.560
Why did you do it?

01:34:04.272 --> 01:34:07.807
What did Shiro promise you
that was worth my life

01:34:07.817 --> 01:34:10.438
and the life of Diane and Amy?

01:34:20.079 --> 01:34:24.408
No, you're not him. It can't be.

01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:52.391
You don't even sound like him.

01:34:52.401 --> 01:34:54.809
Look at my eyes, John.

01:34:54.821 --> 01:34:57.691
The one thing the surgeons
can never change.

01:35:31.898 --> 01:35:34.139
Oh, Jesus, Tom.

01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:36.842
Is it really you?

01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:37.940
Yeah.

01:35:39.572 --> 01:35:41.066
Why didn't you tell me?

01:35:43.617 --> 01:35:47.235
It was the only way
I could get the man responsible.

01:35:47.955 --> 01:35:49.983
But all along...

01:35:49.998 --> 01:35:53.497
I never thought it would
bring me back to my best friend.

01:35:56.921 --> 01:35:59.163
I didn't know they'd send Rogue.

01:35:59.174 --> 01:36:01.581
For Christ sakes,
I thought he was dead!

01:36:01.593 --> 01:36:04.083
They said they wanted
to teach you a lesson.

01:36:04.095 --> 01:36:08.721
For shooting Rogue.
Just rough you up a bit, that's all.

01:36:09.016 --> 01:36:11.971
Is that what they told you?

01:36:11.978 --> 01:36:14.386
Shiro ordered everything.

01:36:15.649 --> 01:36:20.939
I tried to stop working for him,
to get out, so many times.

01:36:23.281 --> 01:36:25.225
I thought if I could make
that son of a bitch

01:36:25.241 --> 01:36:28.491
pay for what he did to you, somehow
it would make things right again.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.777
You think you could forgive me, Tom?

01:36:36.794 --> 01:36:38.454
Tom Lone is dead.

01:36:39.171 --> 01:36:40.831
My name is Rogue.

01:36:42.632 --> 01:36:43.831
No...

01:36:49.222 --> 01:36:50.135
Shit!

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:57.921
