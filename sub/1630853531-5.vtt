WEBVTT

01:22.082 --> 01:22.916
Juliette!

01:25.168 --> 01:26.252
Come back here.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.189
<i>Hysteria,</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:48.191
<i>devastation,</i>

01:49.067 --> 01:53.238
<i>crazy uninhibited highs,</i>
<i>the crashing lows of withdrawal.</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:54.781
<i>It's not pretty.</i>

01:55.865 --> 01:57.784
<i>Not like in the sonnets or pop songs.</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:01.246
<i>It was no match for the gods of Olympus.</i>

02:01.329 --> 02:04.541
<i>So why would I be immune</i>
<i>to the insanity of first love?</i>

02:09.671 --> 02:10.505
Now what?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.720
Vampires have a trick
getting past locked doors.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.813
After you.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.535
What do you think that was on the road?

02:41.578 --> 02:42.704
Some sort of demon.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.330
Maybe an elemental.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.626
But monsters
are definitely back in Savannah.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.633
What was up with your father?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.514
I don't know.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.474
He wasn't himself.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.645
Can we talk about something else?

03:09.439 --> 03:12.859
So... the whole breaking
and entering thing.

03:14.068 --> 03:18.656
-Let's talk about that.
-I've never even broken a water glass.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.869
I don't really know
why I smashed that window. Just...

03:31.669 --> 03:34.380
It's like when we're together, I just...

03:35.882 --> 03:38.885
-do what I feel like doing.
-Instead of what you're expected to do.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.305
Exactly.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.349
I feel the same.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.481
It's like...

03:53.107 --> 03:54.108
Like we're connected.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.071
I'm not talking about the weird dreams.

03:59.948 --> 04:00.782
It's more.

04:12.877 --> 04:13.795
Two houses,

04:15.004 --> 04:16.589
both alike in dignity

04:17.882 --> 04:21.052
in fair Verona, where we lay our scene.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.221
Okay.

04:23.888 --> 04:24.722
Go on.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.268
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

04:29.102 --> 04:33.356
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.196
Ancient grudge.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.908
-Sounds familiar.
-Too familiar.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.327
Every school I've ever gone to
did <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

04:46.995 --> 04:48.997
Plus I've read it, like, 12 times.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.208
Ah. You're enchanted with the bard, I see.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.339
Best friend?

04:59.340 --> 05:02.093
Ben. Since always.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.512
Tess.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.931
Used to be, anyway.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.019
-Reason?
-Let's just say...

05:11.978 --> 05:15.106
"If it doesn't work out, we promise
to go back to being best friends"

05:15.189 --> 05:16.774
are the dumbest words ever spoken.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.360
Yeah.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.237
Favorite memory?

05:21.946 --> 05:24.449
My sister's first spring break from Emory.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.659
It's when we got close.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.330
She opened up to me about everything,
which she'd never done.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.793
We talked all night,
and I opened up too about liking girls.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.298
First time I said it out loud.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.178
I think I was queer from the womb.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.058
My mom kept telling me,
"It's okay if you like girls."

05:50.725 --> 05:53.853
And I was so pissed
because I was marrying Bruno Mars.

05:54.937 --> 05:55.938
And how dare she?

05:57.565 --> 06:00.985
But it turns out I like girls
that look like Bruno Mars.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.822
All right, favorite food.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.704
-Sorry, I--
-It's okay.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.499
We call it "feeding."

06:15.458 --> 06:18.378
Even though blood isn't really food.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.174
-It's complicated.
-I think I understand.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.516
I will always be a hunter.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.686
But I will never hunt you.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.732
And I will never hurt you.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.487
When we're together,
all we have to be is Jules and Cal.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.249
What the hell was that?

06:57.208 --> 06:59.961
I don't know.
Probably just a rat or something.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.464
I'm joking. I'm joking.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.654
So glad I forgot my phone.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.792
-You ready?
-No.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.296
It'll be okay.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.133
We just have to explain to them
that we wanna stay at school today

07:47.216 --> 07:49.719
and get a break from all the family drama.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.137
We?

07:51.637 --> 07:56.392
Jules, there is no "we"
with Talia and Jack Burns.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.187
They're not about this.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.481
Whatever this is.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.568
Well, then we'll tell them
that we'll run if they try to pick us up.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.613
I want today with you.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.367
Let's just try.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.828
Okay?

08:24.670 --> 08:25.505
Where are you?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.049
-We are at school.
<i>-We?</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:29.759
Are you with that girl?

08:29.842 --> 08:32.720
-She has a name.
-Nightcrawler, that's her name.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.056
And you ran away
and stayed out all night with her.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.307
<i>Consequences be damned.</i>

08:36.390 --> 08:38.059
Clearly, you've lost your mind.

08:38.142 --> 08:41.687
Her name is Calliope, and she's the reason
I see myself for who I really am.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.190
<i>You are a Legacy of the oldest bloodline.</i>

08:44.273 --> 08:47.777
They are ruthless monster hunters.

08:48.819 --> 08:52.323
Her family would have slaughtered us all
had they known how.

08:52.406 --> 08:56.536
Instead, they settled for torturing Oliver
and they made sure that I was aware of it.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.330
The Fairmonts
are murderous monsters, Calliope.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.374
You need to come home.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.668
<i>We have a lot to talk about,</i>
<i>and not over the phone.</i>

09:03.751 --> 09:06.045
-Can we talk tonight?
-You hear the "they're monsters" part

09:06.128 --> 09:08.172
-of what I said?
-You don't know her.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.674
<i>Cal would never hurt me.</i>

09:11.133 --> 09:13.386
Jules, don't screw up my engagement.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.721
-Your what?
-<i>Surprise, hunter lover,</i>

09:15.805 --> 09:17.265
I'm getting married.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.103
-I'm coming to get you.
-No, Mom, wait. What is she talking about?

09:22.186 --> 09:26.107
If you were home, you would know.
I will see you in 20 minutes.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.318
Fine. Come. I'm not going with you.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.611
Be outside in 15.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.654
Mom, no.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.655
What?

09:34.365 --> 09:36.617
Please, just listen for three minutes.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.829
I've never joined a club,

09:40.621 --> 09:43.249
been on a sports team,
no organized anything.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.085
We're never in one place long enough.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.047
They asked me to build sets
for <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

09:51.465 --> 09:53.050
Please, can I just stay?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.845
I just want one normal day.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.431
<i>Please.</i>

10:00.349 --> 10:03.185
Stay away
and stay away from Cal's family too.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.647
<i>If you can't give me that,</i>
<i>we're gonna run again.Forever.</i>

10:07.857 --> 10:08.941
Jules, it's Dad.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.026
<i>Are you okay?</i>

10:10.109 --> 10:11.444
Dad. Hi.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.696
Um...

10:14.697 --> 10:16.949
I'm sorry I ran, but you were...

10:18.826 --> 10:21.287
-terrifying.
-<i>Yeah, I guess I'm, um...</i>

10:23.331 --> 10:25.166
I'm going through some changes.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.668
<i>Wait, what kind of changes?</i>

10:29.837 --> 10:31.756
<i>You can tell me when I get home.</i>

10:31.839 --> 10:34.383
Can you please just keep Mom away?

10:35.885 --> 10:39.055
I wanna stay at school
and have one normal day.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.975
You deserve that
after your own father terrified you.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.103
Stay at school,
we will discuss everything tonight.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.649
-She's safe.
-Mm.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.656
-I can stay.
-Me too.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.327
Finally found the one thing
you're not good at. Painting.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.745
-Really?

11:04.789 --> 11:05.623
Juliette?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.626
Can I borrow you a sec?

11:19.970 --> 11:24.558
Are we pretending you're not a vampire
and we didn't just bury a body?

11:24.642 --> 11:25.726
Come here, cutie.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.355
I see what's happening.
Distracting me with my love language?

11:29.438 --> 11:32.191
That worked when we were 7
and up until yesterday,

11:32.274 --> 11:35.111
but today, you need to answer my question.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.405
Cal and I are...

11:38.823 --> 11:41.242
-I think we're a thing now.
-She's your girlfriend?

11:42.159 --> 11:46.664
Well, I'm not sure, but we have a plan.
She's accepting me for me.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.251
What does that mean?
That she's gonna floss your fangs?

11:50.334 --> 11:51.961
Don't be an asshole about this.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.881
I'm not trying to rain on your glow,
but I'm a fan of reality.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.051
And playing with humans
doesn't make you an actual human

11:59.135 --> 12:02.888
any more than playing with a Barbie doll
makes you a Barbie doll too.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.850
Fan of reality?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.352
Okay.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.272
Whose reality, Ben? Not your own.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.609
Because your reality is Noah,
a straight boy with a girlfriend.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.113
Which makes you a sidepiece
in a closet he's not coming out of.

12:24.994 --> 12:25.828
I'm sorry.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.039
-I didn't--
-Have fun playing make-believe.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.142
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:52.396 --> 12:56.692
I feel like I blinked
and you became this self-assured woman

12:56.776 --> 12:58.486
who didn't need her dad anymore.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.489
-I will always need you, Dad.
-I appreciate that.

13:03.532 --> 13:07.328
-Which brings me to the Davenports.
-You mean my future in-laws?

13:07.411 --> 13:08.412
Ugh.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.796
Means so much to me you were willing to do

13:16.879 --> 13:20.216
whatever you needed to do
to save my life, but...

13:22.134 --> 13:24.845
you don't need to do this.
I don't want you to do this.

13:24.929 --> 13:28.766
-Sebastian, please. Mother will hear.
-I can't believe

13:28.849 --> 13:31.852
you're comfortable selling off
our daughter to appease your mother.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.812
I'm sorry.

13:32.895 --> 13:33.979
Selling her off?

13:34.063 --> 13:36.357
I didn't know
that's how matriarchies worked.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.819
The Emerald Malkia saved you,
made you full Legacy.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.197
When are you going to start respecting
the traditions of our bloodline?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.659
You took my last name to spite your mother
and her traditions, remember?

13:47.284 --> 13:48.285
For love.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.956
Elinor's cause is also a noble one.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.792
The Davenports are hungry, Sebastian.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.170
For centuries,
they have wanted to displace us

13:58.254 --> 13:59.588
and claim the Emerald Malkia.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.048
That damn hunter raid

14:01.131 --> 14:04.218
gave them the opportunity
that they were looking for.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.930
Mother also believes
that what happened at the consecration

14:08.013 --> 14:11.392
will add fuel to their quest,
and she's probably right.

14:11.475 --> 14:13.894
We are not auctioning off our daughter.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.690
-Sebastian--
-Okay, let's bring the rage down to a two.

14:25.614 --> 14:26.532
Dad...

14:29.034 --> 14:30.578
I want this engagement.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.622
And no, it's not about love.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.250
I'm not sure I even want that,
to be honest.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.880
What I do want,
and what I've known I've wanted

14:40.963 --> 14:42.756
since I was in grade school...

14:43.883 --> 14:44.717
is power.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.762
Wanna claim my rightful place
as an Atwood heir,

14:48.846 --> 14:51.181
be the Keeper of the Emerald Malkia.

14:52.016 --> 14:52.850
One day.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.354
But I can't pursue my chosen path
without your blessing.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.610
You're right.
You've always known exactly who you are.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.696
And if you are on this path, then...

15:07.323 --> 15:09.992
it's because you want to be
and I will support you,

15:10.075 --> 15:14.580
but you can change your mind
at any time. I mean it. Any time.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.168
-I love you, Dad.
-And I'm not playing dress-up for Davina

15:19.251 --> 15:21.837
and I'm certainly not attending dinner
with your guests.

15:21.921 --> 15:27.009
-Is that what this is about? Henry?
-I have no interest in sharing a meal

15:27.092 --> 15:28.636
with your ex-fiancé.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.596
Oh, please, Sebastian.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.723
Don't be a sore winner.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.059
No, Mom, I agree with Dad.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.478
He's not exactly presentable.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.774
We are in uncharted waters.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.445
There's never been
a Made vampire turned Legacy before.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.406
Let's hope the shedding stops
before the wedding.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.498
No shedding
before the wedding. Got it.

15:58.999 --> 16:02.252
She called. She's at school
and doesn't wanna come home.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.587
Why?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.591
Because she wants to have a normal day.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.679
I'm picking her up as soon as I shower.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.073
<i>This is torture.</i>

16:31.156 --> 16:32.825
I can barely breathe.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.368
Breathing is overrated.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.747
Tom Davenport won't be able to resist you.

16:39.498 --> 16:43.836
Once the families are joined,
they'll stop attempting to dethrone me

16:44.586 --> 16:46.380
and our future will be secure.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.341
Then I'd say it's in the bag.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.927
Or in the Spanx.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.639
This is not a joke.

16:56.724 --> 17:00.060
The Legacy power structure
is an intricate game of chess.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.730
Influence, fear and allegiances

17:02.813 --> 17:05.858
have kept our family
in power for centuries.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.112
Her sense of humor
is how Elinor handles stress.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.614
You won't be able
to manhandle her much longer

17:12.698 --> 17:16.201
without her responding in kind.
She is your granddaughter.

17:23.208 --> 17:27.337
The center of all strength,
the home of all desires is the heart.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.133
Emerald Malkia willed it so.

17:36.013 --> 17:40.392
The center of all strength,
the home of all desires is the heart.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.770
Emerald Malkia willed it so.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.151
Staking us will not destroy us.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.737
Lilith will always protect us

17:51.820 --> 17:56.116
and the Atwoods
will forever be the Keepers of the Malkia.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.809
I've only got five minutes.
I gotta get to practice.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.979
Okay, well, five minutes now,
more time in my house tonight.

18:26.063 --> 18:26.897
I can't.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.734
Phillipa's grandma's birthday.
She's turning 80.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.363
So now I gotta get in line
behind your girlfriend's grandmother?

18:34.446 --> 18:35.906
Are we really doing this again?

18:37.324 --> 18:38.158
Fine.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.205
Dude, delete that right now.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.166
If I can't have you,
give me something for the spank bank.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.545
Don't play around. Okay, no evidence.
Phillipa and I are getting serious.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.549
I'm serious about you too, Noah.
So, what are we doing?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.342
-Are you for real right now?
-Deadass.

18:55.425 --> 18:57.970
We're doing what we always do. Hooking up.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.681
You start acting like it's more than that
and we're done.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.932
Give it to me.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.146
What the hell was that?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.030
Look, whatever it is...

19:19.867 --> 19:20.826
Letty will know.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.537
What? Why? What the hell was that?

19:26.331 --> 19:27.791
Lock the doors, please.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.169
Cal. That's the monster alarm.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.420
We are in lockdown.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.505
You know how this works.

19:33.589 --> 19:38.177
On the floor, while I make a call
to make sure that it's not a drill.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.520
-He's not texting me back.
-Just give him a minute to cool down.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.772
He doesn't seem like the kind to stay mad.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.610
Okay. This is not a drill.
We are on lockdown.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.821
No one leaves
until we get the "all clear."

19:59.406 --> 20:01.200
-It's Ben.
-See?

20:04.286 --> 20:05.495
Okay, this is weird.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.123
Some kind of orbs.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.291
Those aren't orbs.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.628
Those are eyes. It's a fricking zombie.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.546
Zombie?

20:15.255 --> 20:16.131
Maddy, a word?

20:22.387 --> 20:23.639
B positive, madams.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.935
-Where's the AB girl?
-I'll have her swing by at once.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.106
Divine. Thank you.
They're free range, you know.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.275
Oh, I envy you Canadians.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.445
The population of humans
willing to be blood servants

20:38.528 --> 20:39.863
is almost nonexistent.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.282
But only a work visa away.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.701
How do you think it's going over there?

20:47.329 --> 20:49.373
Looks like it's going well.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.666
So it is.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.876
But now that it's just us chickens,

20:53.418 --> 20:56.797
how the hell did that hunting party
find you in Savannah?

20:56.880 --> 21:00.926
Ah. I can assure you
that threat has been neutralized.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.887
My darling Juliette
even helped lead the charge.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.806
A threat, Madam Keeper?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.226
Neutralized by your teenage granddaughter

21:09.309 --> 21:12.521
who didn't bother
to show up at her own consecration

21:13.188 --> 21:14.731
nor this important family dinner.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.151
We had to hire security
to escort us out of town.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.821
I know. It was horrid.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.447
And the Emerald Malkia?

21:22.531 --> 21:24.408
Oh, serpent be blessed.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.659
She was unharmed.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.746
My former black ops team
escorted her to a safe location.

21:30.247 --> 21:34.835
Still, you have to ask yourself
how they knew where to find you.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.921
No wonder the council is all abuzz.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.882
As I said,
I have the situation under control.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.428
I've been feeding on humans for 300 years.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.596
You'd think
I'd have it figured out by now.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.556
It's okay.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.183
Gives me the opportunity to apologize.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.228
What I did was indefensible.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.564
Leaving you at the altar like that.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.900
I don't know why I wasn't honest sooner.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.279
Because your mother
wouldn't have allowed it.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.782
But eventually, I understood.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.369
Despite our upbringing, I believe in love.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.291
Is Sebastian not joining us?

22:15.542 --> 22:19.004
-He's still recovering.
-Well, please give him my regards.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.047
You're too kind.

22:21.798 --> 22:22.883
Friends.

22:23.467 --> 22:27.471
Oh. In-laws, if today goes as planned.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.060
Argentina. Have you been?

22:33.685 --> 22:36.813
-Can't say I have.
-I spent months there after Boston.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.776
-Harvard?
-Undergrad, business school.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.780
Anyway, the blood in Buenos Aires, divine.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.408
Something about the latitude
and open space.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.160
You haven't tasted anything like it.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.829
You'll have to take me some time.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.165
Anything for my betrothed.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.880
Let's cut to the chase, Tom.

23:02.631 --> 23:06.676
What do you want from this?
And spare me the nonsense about love.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.553
Who needs love when you have power?

23:08.637 --> 23:11.181
A man not intimidated by a powerful woman.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.933
With an issue or two.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.686
Word on the street is
Keeper isn't up for the job.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.482
And where did I hear that from?

23:22.025 --> 23:25.695
Oh, yeah, from someone
who heard it from your brother.

23:25.779 --> 23:26.780
Hmm.

23:27.447 --> 23:31.868
Oliver's a pathological liar
with unresolved mommy issues.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.496
Madam. Sir. B positive?

23:36.790 --> 23:37.624
Well, then.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.334
To marriage.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.669
To first marriages.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.802
-Chill.
-What if someone finds us together?

23:48.885 --> 23:51.680
We're friends,
we hang out with the same crew.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.515
-I'm out.
-Noah, don't, please.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.270
-There might be a monster out there.
-That's insane.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.357
There haven't been monsters in Savannah
in decades. I've never seen one.

24:02.441 --> 24:06.361
Maybe this whole "no monsters
in a decade" thing might not be true,

24:06.445 --> 24:09.948
-please stay put until she hits me back.
-No, I can't get caught with you!

24:13.827 --> 24:14.786
Letty was right.

24:16.079 --> 24:19.499
And the saddest part, I know you like me.

24:20.250 --> 24:24.588
You call after too many White Claws
and text me random cute dog memes.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.257
I'm the one on FaceTime
with you at 3:00 a.m.,

24:27.340 --> 24:30.051
not your girlfriend, because you're
too scared to tell her who you are.

24:30.135 --> 24:34.264
And I'm better than some hookup
in a random musty gym.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.725
I'm worth screaming about from rooftops.

24:38.768 --> 24:43.148
Maybe life gets better for you...
but it won't get better than me.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.779
Again, not a relationship.

24:51.948 --> 24:52.782
Never was.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.826
Never will be.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.809
That picture,
I hope Ben didn't get close to it.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.813
Hey, try to focus, okay?
Stay light on your feet.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.107
It's an urban myth
that zombies are slow-moving.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.818
Real zombies are mad fast and deadly.

25:29.653 --> 25:30.570
Whoa.

25:32.447 --> 25:36.493
-How do you know all this?
-I come from a family of monster hunters.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.621
By the time I was 6,
I was asking Mall Santa for a katana.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.915
Get away from me!

25:44.042 --> 25:45.293
Get away from me!

25:50.382 --> 25:51.925
What is that? What is going on?

25:56.096 --> 25:56.930
Please!

25:58.348 --> 26:00.559
Help! Help!

26:00.642 --> 26:02.394
Somebody help me!

26:03.895 --> 26:05.105
Help!

26:06.106 --> 26:07.816
Help!

26:45.186 --> 26:47.647
You're safe with me, okay?

26:48.398 --> 26:49.232
I got you.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.569
I know.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.071
I've got you too.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.832
Drink up. I gotta get back downstairs.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.006
Someone was hungry.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.759
Starving. No matter what I eat.

27:17.093 --> 27:21.097
Wish I could say there was more, but that
Davenport woman can throw back the CCs.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.308
Ugh. She's repulsive.

27:24.851 --> 27:28.271
-What about her horrid son?
-He seemed kind of cool.

27:28.355 --> 27:29.814
You can't be serious.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.360
He's funny. I mean, he's making Mom laugh.

27:33.443 --> 27:37.530
Real laughs? Or more polite laughter?

27:38.615 --> 27:40.617
Dad, really?

27:40.700 --> 27:43.203
-I should go down.
-No, absolutely not.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.829
Do not ruin this for me.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.125
So you like Tom, then?

27:51.836 --> 27:55.090
He's a tool, but a tool I can use.

27:56.299 --> 28:00.095
I love that you are ambitious
and determined, but those hyenas

28:00.178 --> 28:02.305
have even more reason to use you.

28:03.264 --> 28:06.059
-They can try.
-Your grandmother is one of them.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.605
If this goes south,
she will do nothing to protect you.

28:14.067 --> 28:18.822
Ugh. It's Mom. Dad, I'm fine. It's fine.
I should head back down there.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.990
-If you want out...
-I love you too.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.966
-You got my text.
-If this is a sequel to the other night,

28:38.049 --> 28:40.301
I don't have the time
or patience to let you live.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.511
My husband almost died.

28:41.594 --> 28:44.597
My best friends were murdered.
Mike Franklin. Sarah Franklin.

28:45.306 --> 28:48.727
They're dead and their daughter Tess,
who I've known since she was a baby,

28:48.810 --> 28:51.104
-she has no one now.
-Whose fault is that?

28:52.605 --> 28:54.983
I'm on my way to pick up
my daughter from school.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.568
Since you're on the way--

28:56.651 --> 28:59.279
She's not here,
if that's what you're asking.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.157
I have to assume
you got the same call we got.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.701
"Let me stay at school
and I promise to come home."

29:04.784 --> 29:07.120
"Try to pick me up, Cal and I will run."

29:07.203 --> 29:09.581
Mine was smart enough to leave that out.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.418
Look, Margot,
I just want my daughter home.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.545
She doesn't know about the Franklins yet.

29:15.628 --> 29:18.173
It didn't feel right
sharing that over the phone.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.468
Juliette's father was really sick
after you nearly killed him.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.679
-We didn't share that with Jules either.
-I'd like to call a truce.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.891
At least until our daughters
are where they should be.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.477
Of course. So would I.

29:31.644 --> 29:33.313
If only it were that simple.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.610
But it is that simple.
I spotted two armed guards in your trees.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.570
You're obviously safe.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.659
I'll keep my family at bay.
Don't make me out to be a fool.

29:46.743 --> 29:50.079
I won't underestimate you
if you don't underestimate me.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.835
Oh, Margot, give my regards to Oliver.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.638
That looked tense.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.057
Is everything okay?

30:09.140 --> 30:13.645
Oh, new neighbor asking
about shopping in the historic district.

30:13.728 --> 30:16.147
Quaint how you still bond with humans.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.024
Well, I play one in real life.

30:19.317 --> 30:22.278
They're so... frail.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.073
Had I been a different kind of monster,

30:25.657 --> 30:27.575
I might have ripped out
Sebastian's throat.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.915
Everyone gather around, please.

30:41.130 --> 30:41.965
You ready?

31:08.992 --> 31:11.327
Jules, it's your girl, Smashley.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.538
You scared me
when you broke into the theater.

31:14.163 --> 31:14.998
Ashley?

31:16.457 --> 31:18.960
I was running my lines
and you two came in.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.170
I'm Lady Montague, remember?

31:24.007 --> 31:26.217
Oh, where is Romeo?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.468
Saw you him today?

31:28.553 --> 31:29.721
Could you take me home?

31:29.804 --> 31:33.558
I tried to find it,
but I keep getting lost.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.230
Maybe you can call my phone?
I can't find it either.

31:39.814 --> 31:40.940
<i>You scared me.</i>

31:41.024 --> 31:43.985
Hey, sweetie. Just relax. Relax.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.403
Sorry.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.863
Well, that was easy.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.242
Jules, listen to me.
She's not the Ashley you knew.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.202
Not anymore.

31:55.830 --> 31:58.583
-Nothing feels normal anymore.
-You're not Ashley!

32:10.219 --> 32:14.766
This engagement is contingent
upon being blessed by the Emerald Malkia.

32:14.849 --> 32:17.977
We would like her to be
the sole authority to consecrate the union

32:18.061 --> 32:20.897
and final authority to dissolve it.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.609
Perfect. There's only one
outstanding issue and it's settled.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.569
Proof.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.155
Proof that following
the grievous shit show

32:29.238 --> 32:32.075
that was Juliette's Legacy consecration,

32:32.158 --> 32:37.455
that our precious maker is not ensconced
in some sad hunter's herpetarium.

32:37.538 --> 32:43.211
That you, Davina Atwood, are indeed
still Keeper of the Emerald Malkia.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.508
No. Absolutely not.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.846
Without proof, there can be no union.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.433
Well, perhaps there should be no union.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.353
-The Sugimotos have a son.
-Yes.

33:01.312 --> 33:05.108
You know Akio,
kind, handsome, twice your wealth.

33:05.191 --> 33:11.447
Last summer, he took the 16-hour flight
from Tokyo just to bring Elinor peonies.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.532
Oh!

33:12.615 --> 33:14.409
You insult me, Davina.

33:14.492 --> 33:15.994
Your request insults me.

33:16.577 --> 33:19.038
Boys, fetch the servants. We're leaving.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.458
You may have influence, Loretta,

33:22.542 --> 33:26.754
but without the Malkia,
you'll never know the power you crave.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.470
We'll assume the mother serpent is safe.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.014
As well you should.

33:37.140 --> 33:37.974
Heirs.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.477
-We'll require seven.
-Five.

33:41.561 --> 33:45.773
-Unless the first is a girl, three.
-What if the first three are sons?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.108
Then you keep trying.

33:47.191 --> 33:50.862
It's your responsibility
to carry on the Atwood lineage.

33:50.945 --> 33:55.700
I'm agreeable to heirs, but I won't sign
a contract stating I'll have ten kids.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.618
I'm sure that won't happen.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.995
Stop it now.

33:59.078 --> 34:02.999
Let's agree to the terms,
get the loot, work out the details later.

34:08.546 --> 34:14.177
Mrs. Davenport, I'm simply asking that
the contract and our expectations align.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.262
Why is she speaking?

34:16.345 --> 34:19.557
Does no one in this family
respect protocol?

34:19.640 --> 34:22.560
-Elinor.
-Mama, I need to speak to Dad.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.481
-Of course.
-Excuse me.

34:29.567 --> 34:34.197
Margot, be a dear
and continue with the next item

34:34.280 --> 34:36.532
while I go see how our Elinor's doing.

34:37.992 --> 34:38.868
Of course.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.376
-It wasn't her.
-No.

34:48.961 --> 34:49.796
Not anymore.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.424
My God, are you all right?

34:54.842 --> 34:57.053
That's a lot of your blood.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.513
My first kill.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.849
That was my first kill.

35:10.024 --> 35:10.858
You okay?

35:14.237 --> 35:17.615
I was--
I was fine with Noah's blood, but...

35:18.825 --> 35:19.659
yours is...

35:21.702 --> 35:22.578
It's bad.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.250
I know. But you don't wanna hurt me.

35:28.626 --> 35:29.877
I know that too.

35:31.712 --> 35:32.547
Of course.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.050
Okay.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.305
Let's move her body before the final bell.

35:42.348 --> 35:44.308
I am fighting for our position.

35:44.934 --> 35:49.272
So you had better stop this childish
behavior and do your part as promised.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.482
I've changed my mind, Grandmother.

35:52.233 --> 35:55.027
I'm not moving to Toronto
to pimp out my uterus.

35:55.111 --> 35:59.031
Then you're as useless as
your deranged brother and anemic sister.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.041
Hey, you changed your mind?

36:09.667 --> 36:10.585
-Yeah.
-Good.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.463
-Where were you going?
-I don't know.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.175
Just-- I'm trying to
overhear or something.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.718
Tell me what happened.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.553
-Elinor.
-Davina.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.098
She's done. Please, you need to back off.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.143
You are in no position
to demand anything of me.

36:27.226 --> 36:29.353
Elinor, your entire useless family--

36:29.437 --> 36:32.690
I've had enough of you
insulting my family. She is done.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.777
Looks like her inferior genes won.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.453
-I can't breathe.
-Davina, we're done. You need to back off.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.539
I'm the Keeper of the Emerald Malkia
and you will treat me--

36:48.623 --> 36:52.335
Like you deserve to be treated.
You need to get out of my house.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.840
I saved your worthless life
and you will treat me with respect.

36:58.382 --> 36:59.467
As will you.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.803
Half of you is Atwood.
It's time you acted like one.

37:05.973 --> 37:07.183
No!

37:19.111 --> 37:20.488
Back! Please move back!

37:30.957 --> 37:31.916
My first zombie.

37:36.045 --> 37:36.963
Check the body.

37:42.176 --> 37:45.179
Juliette. Check the body.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.487
Couldn't have done that
before we carried your heavy ass?

38:01.570 --> 38:03.656
Once they find Noah's body,
everyone will know.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.574
Monsters are back.

38:12.081 --> 38:12.999
You have to go.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.836
-You have to fight this.
-I'm trying.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.894
-You know that won't kill me.
-Remember the bee?

38:34.937 --> 38:38.274
On my shoulder.
When you invited me to Noah's party.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.193
I thought you were a monster too.

38:42.611 --> 38:47.325
But then you scooped that tiny little bee
and you asked me to make a wish.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.494
That's not what monsters do.

38:51.996 --> 38:55.082
You wouldn't hurt that bee
and you won't hurt me.

38:57.084 --> 39:01.630
Just... go... now!

39:11.891 --> 39:13.768
The Davenports are restless.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.482
-What in Lilith's name?
-My love, um...

39:21.400 --> 39:22.234
Davina, she--

39:24.445 --> 39:28.282
She went too far. She--
She continued to insult our family.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.534
She physically assaulted me.

39:30.618 --> 39:34.080
She tried to drag Elinor downstairs.
She went too damn far.

39:34.663 --> 39:35.956
Where is Mother now?

39:38.918 --> 39:40.795
I ate her.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.590
You ate my mother?

39:46.759 --> 39:47.676
Yeah.

39:53.265 --> 39:55.476
I didn't even know that was possible.

39:58.062 --> 40:02.900
Margot... you left
one of your own at the altar.

40:04.777 --> 40:10.241
You gave up everything that you had
because you fell in love with me, a human.

40:11.283 --> 40:16.831
Even when I got sick, we agreed you would
turn me so that we would never be apart.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.749
We loved each other that much.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.836
We built an amazing life together.

40:21.919 --> 40:27.341
You... You and Elinor and Juliette
are my everything.

40:27.425 --> 40:32.805
And I will never tolerate an attack
of any kind on any of you.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.523
Tell the Davenports
we've changed our mind.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.733
The engagement is off.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.485
They're free to go.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.528
Are you sure?

40:48.237 --> 40:51.866
As the Emerald Malkia's
new Keeper-in-Waiting, the decision...

40:53.826 --> 40:55.035
is yours.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.500
Thank you, Mother.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.618
Death follows you everywhere.

41:36.368 --> 41:37.620
Oliver, let her go!

41:39.747 --> 41:42.082
Aw! They broke our zombie.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.004
You killed Ashley?

41:47.087 --> 41:50.341
She came back to school
rotting and confused.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.428
-How could you do that?
-Did it for you.

41:56.972 --> 42:00.017
-What the hell are you talking about?
-I've been here for months.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.728
Watching Margot buy blood pills
in back alleys.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.524
I know those aren't for Elinor,
which meant you weren't eating.

42:07.608 --> 42:11.320
I'm sure you were hungry.
I've been there. I wanted to help you.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.239
So I went to that party.

42:14.073 --> 42:18.077
Found an easy target. I killed the lights
and left you a present.

42:18.619 --> 42:22.998
I thought if you saw that fresh,
oozing goodness, your bloodlust would win.

42:23.749 --> 42:26.418
Once a girl's dead,
why not make her a zombie?

42:27.503 --> 42:29.672
Plus, Carmen needed
a human liver for an elixir.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.048
Thank you, babe.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.845
You say you wanna help me?

42:38.305 --> 42:41.559
You tried to force me
to bite somebody, like Elinor did.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.602
I'm nothing like Elinor.

42:45.187 --> 42:46.021
It was her.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.317
<i>It was her we saw at Noah's party.</i>

42:53.862 --> 42:56.865
-It was her we saw on the road last night.
-You have a good memory.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.617
You also owe us a zombie.

42:58.701 --> 43:02.538
-You'll make a fine replacement.
-She won't be replacing anything.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.211
Run. He won't hurt me.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.340
-Get out of here.
-No, I'm not leaving you!

43:13.424 --> 43:15.968
Babe, can't you see?

43:16.927 --> 43:18.262
Your sister's in love.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.515
Please. You have to go, Cal.

43:22.474 --> 43:24.268
Cal, I'm begging you.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.441
<i>It is impossible to be immune</i>
<i>to the insanity of first love.</i>

43:31.108 --> 43:34.069
<i>A union predestined, written in the stars.</i>

43:34.862 --> 43:38.741
<i>That's the only way I can wrap my head</i>
<i>around it.But every tear,</i>

43:38.824 --> 43:44.038
<i>every skipped heartbeat, the passion,</i>
<i>the pain, it's all worth it in the end.</i>

43:44.121 --> 43:45.331
Why did you come back?

43:46.624 --> 43:48.167
I thought you'd never ask.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.755
I want Elinor's pretty little head
on a stake.

43:55.007 --> 43:59.428
I'm not sure what you were told,
but Elinor made our parents throw me away.

44:00.179 --> 44:01.889
Like I was some trash.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.098
Left me for dead.

44:04.433 --> 44:08.062
I want her to pay for her sins
and you're gonna help me.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.938
-Are you insane?
-No, I'm not.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.233
What if we can...
turn you into a real girl?

44:17.780 --> 44:18.947
There's a spell for that.

44:19.615 --> 44:23.702
Help me bring Elinor down, and
you and Cal can live happily ever after.

44:23.786 --> 44:26.121
No strings attached. I promise.
