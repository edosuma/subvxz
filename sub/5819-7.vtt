00:00.365 --> 00:01.819
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.850 --> 00:04.155
If this prophesy is fulfilled,

00:04.185 --> 00:06.573
you will all fall... one by friend,

00:06.603 --> 00:09.771
one by foe, and one by family.

00:09.773 --> 00:11.323
In the moments before you asked me

00:11.353 --> 00:13.314
to flee with you, I saw your brother.

00:13.344 --> 00:14.476
You must only think of him

00:14.478 --> 00:16.300
as the monster that he truly is.

00:16.329 --> 00:19.336
I see him as the monster that he is.

00:19.366 --> 00:21.018
Those remains used to be my mom.

00:21.048 --> 00:22.073
I'm so sorry.

00:22.103 --> 00:23.519
I'm gonna find out how this happened.

00:23.521 --> 00:26.043
Even if we figure out who killed this guy,

00:26.073 --> 00:27.607
it's a vampire.

00:27.836 --> 00:30.692
I think you know exactly
where my medallion is.

00:30.904 --> 00:32.503
Take it. It's in here.

00:33.922 --> 00:36.398
My brother and Lucien want to use it

00:36.400 --> 00:38.585
to lock you and your siblings away forever.

00:38.615 --> 00:40.704
Which is why they sent a legion of Strix

00:40.734 --> 00:42.059
to collect my sister.

00:42.089 --> 00:43.727
I can't find her, her witch body.

00:43.757 --> 00:45.246
It's as if it just vanished.

00:45.276 --> 00:46.763
Two of the men sent to retrieve her

00:46.793 --> 00:48.849
were from my sire line.

00:48.879 --> 00:50.862
They procured your sister's body.

00:50.964 --> 00:53.560
Now come back to bed.

00:58.488 --> 00:59.777
So where is Klaus?

00:59.807 --> 01:01.223
When I told him about Rebekah,

01:01.225 --> 01:03.375
he said he's pursue another lead.

01:06.846 --> 01:08.880
Forget Niklaus.

01:10.807 --> 01:12.818
You will find her.

01:12.820 --> 01:14.124
Now, you sure you got enough juju

01:14.154 --> 01:15.609
for a worldwide locator spell?

01:15.639 --> 01:19.141
She's my family. I won't lose her.

02:10.243 --> 02:11.560
Damn it.

02:12.395 --> 02:15.330
So much for witch GPS.

02:15.332 --> 02:17.416
I assumed they'd cloak her.

02:17.418 --> 02:19.201
I didn't expect a spell this strong.

02:19.203 --> 02:20.402
No doubt conjured by the very witch

02:20.404 --> 02:22.393
who lured Rebekah into this trap.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.124
You should all go.

02:25.126 --> 02:27.926
I have my work cut out for me.

02:27.928 --> 02:29.378
The Strix trust me.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.797
If they know where
Rebekah is, I can find her.

02:31.799 --> 02:33.015
We don't have time.

02:33.017 --> 02:34.249
You need to stop Davina from activating

02:34.251 --> 02:35.417
Lucien and Tristan's weapon.

02:35.419 --> 02:37.052
We need to find Rebekah.

02:37.054 --> 02:40.272
Marcel, I will not rest
until my sister is found.

02:42.758 --> 02:47.029
All right. Fine. I'll handle Davina.

02:47.864 --> 02:49.281
Well, in the meantime, please

02:49.283 --> 02:50.699
tell me that we're gonna kill someone.

02:50.701 --> 02:52.901
Oh, we will kill many someones,

02:52.903 --> 02:55.270
but first, if we're to start a war,

02:55.272 --> 02:58.624
let us determine where our allegiances lie.

03:00.126 --> 03:02.628
Niklaus?

03:07.250 --> 03:09.084
Niklaus.

03:09.086 --> 03:12.610
You shout loud enough to wake the dead.

03:13.578 --> 03:16.892
Can't pick up your phone?
Your sister is missing.

03:17.677 --> 03:21.963
Well, she's not exactly missing...

03:23.683 --> 03:25.601
And as long as everyone behaves themselves,

03:25.603 --> 03:27.903
you can trust me to tell you where she is.

03:29.906 --> 03:32.140
Hello, Elijah.

03:33.359 --> 03:36.578
Give me my sister, or perhaps I could

03:36.580 --> 03:39.248
pay a little visit to your brother Tristan.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.782
Elijah, please.

03:40.784 --> 03:42.784
Aurora and I have come to an agreement.

03:42.786 --> 03:45.420
Yes. Nik and I find that,

03:45.422 --> 03:47.155
now your vile act of compulsion

03:47.157 --> 03:48.790
has been revealed, there's really

03:48.792 --> 03:50.292
no reason why we can't pick up

03:50.294 --> 03:52.177
where we left off a thousand years ago.

03:54.464 --> 03:56.798
Go on, luv.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.219
I need to have a word with my brother.

04:05.441 --> 04:08.176
Am I to assume that
you've gone completely mad?

04:08.178 --> 04:10.896
You see madness. I see method.

04:10.898 --> 04:13.014
And that method would be what, Niklaus,

04:13.016 --> 04:14.849
to fornicate with the she-devil

04:14.851 --> 04:16.118
who took our sister?

04:16.120 --> 04:18.237
To be clear, The Strix took our sister.

04:18.238 --> 04:19.904
Aurora simply hijacked her.

04:19.906 --> 04:23.024
I will get Rebekah back, trust me.

04:23.026 --> 04:26.027
Keeping Aurora close
garners the goodwill we need.

04:26.029 --> 04:29.197
Well, it is a bold, if
somewhat lecherous plan.

04:29.199 --> 04:30.532
Will you employ the same tactic

04:30.534 --> 04:31.967
when it comes time to
retrieve the medallion

04:31.969 --> 04:33.201
from Lucien and Tristan?

04:33.203 --> 04:34.836
They're not really my type.

04:37.423 --> 04:39.641
There must be another way.

04:39.643 --> 04:42.043
Aurora will always protect Tristan,

04:42.045 --> 04:44.646
and, given that he and Lucien are aligned,

04:44.648 --> 04:45.880
the 3 of them together have

04:45.882 --> 04:48.550
a distinct advantage, unless...

04:50.987 --> 04:53.994
unless we break that advantage.

04:55.257 --> 04:58.493
Now, there's a strategy
I wholeheartedly endorse.

04:58.495 --> 05:00.162
What do you have in mind?

05:00.164 --> 05:01.747
It's Thanksgiving.

05:01.749 --> 05:03.398
Let's invite them for a friendly meal,

05:03.400 --> 05:05.033
systematically turn
them against one another,

05:05.035 --> 05:08.069
and then devastate their pitiful alliance.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.008
I can feel the holiday spirit already.

05:17.242 --> 05:21.627
= synced and corrected by Shahrazade =
...www.addic7ed.com...

05:40.570 --> 05:43.238
Perhaps I should apologize.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.940
I know you were expecting
to find Rebekah's body,

05:45.942 --> 05:48.243
but I've got other plans.

05:50.780 --> 05:53.999
Aurora...

05:54.001 --> 05:56.218
What am I to do with you?

05:56.220 --> 05:58.286
Oh, my dear brother, after all this time,

05:58.288 --> 06:00.088
why not simply choose to trust me?

06:00.090 --> 06:02.007
Well, because I know you arrived

06:02.009 --> 06:03.958
in this city days ago.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.461
You've had time to poison Lucien's witch

06:06.463 --> 06:08.597
and see your infamous ex, but you've

06:08.599 --> 06:11.132
all but ignored your own brother.

06:11.134 --> 06:12.434
Well, next time, don't leave me

06:12.436 --> 06:14.603
a prisoner in some stuffy monastery.

06:14.605 --> 06:15.970
Message received,

06:15.972 --> 06:18.306
unfortunately for those poor monks.

06:18.308 --> 06:20.909
May I ask what you did with the head

06:20.911 --> 06:23.445
of your sire line?

06:23.447 --> 06:25.947
Acquiring her was part of my plan.

06:25.949 --> 06:27.582
Oh, yes, that plan, that plan that

06:27.584 --> 06:29.251
you and Lucien were keeping from me.

06:29.253 --> 06:31.370
You were recovering,

06:31.372 --> 06:33.955
and, if you must know, we needed Rebekah

06:33.957 --> 06:36.157
as bait to lure Klaus and Elijah.

06:36.159 --> 06:38.343
She'd have been perfectly safe with us.

06:38.345 --> 06:40.712
- You'd have been safe.
- Yes.

06:40.714 --> 06:45.350
Well, I prefer to be in
control of my own fate.

06:45.352 --> 06:47.269
Hmm.

06:48.149 --> 06:50.472
Should I even bother to ask

06:50.474 --> 06:52.774
what these are?

06:52.776 --> 06:54.976
Call it insurance.

06:54.978 --> 06:56.678
Perhaps you'll trust me now.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.146
You'll need to if you are to join me

06:58.148 --> 06:59.781
for dinner at the Mikaelsons'.

06:59.783 --> 07:00.949
I received their invitation

07:00.951 --> 07:02.951
to this Thanksgiving summit.

07:02.953 --> 07:04.953
It's clearly a trap.

07:04.955 --> 07:10.024
Open the envelope. Put your mind at ease.

07:10.026 --> 07:12.744
You're my family, Tristan.

07:12.746 --> 07:15.530
You have always taken care of me.

07:15.532 --> 07:18.032
Allow me to return the favor.

07:43.042 --> 07:45.527
Oh, don't you look lovely.

07:45.529 --> 07:47.279
Something wrong?

07:47.281 --> 07:49.114
Should I make a list?

07:49.116 --> 07:50.782
You tortured detective Kinney,

07:50.784 --> 07:52.367
gave him a compulsion lobotomy,

07:52.369 --> 07:55.008
not to mention you're
holding me against my will

07:55.038 --> 07:57.739
and using up all of my minutes.

07:57.741 --> 08:00.347
I mean, I appreciate your
dead witch's hand-me-downs

08:00.377 --> 08:02.816
and remembering to feed
me, but did you really think

08:02.846 --> 08:05.079
I was just going to smile and eat up?

08:05.081 --> 08:06.965
Well, think of all the poor people

08:06.967 --> 08:10.601
who are starving in... well, somewhere.

08:10.603 --> 08:13.221
I'd join you, but I've been called

08:13.223 --> 08:14.661
to dine with the Mikaelsons.

08:14.691 --> 08:16.691
Are they going to serve
your head on a platter?

08:16.693 --> 08:19.027
Doubtful. Niklaus and I are allies

08:19.029 --> 08:21.496
now that the evil Tristan is in town.

08:21.798 --> 08:23.514
Um, let me ask, are you more likely

08:23.516 --> 08:24.665
to tell Vincent that you're

08:24.667 --> 08:26.000
drowning in a tub of bourbon

08:26.002 --> 08:27.835
or awash in a sea of chardonnay?

08:27.837 --> 08:30.054
- Go to hell.
- Bourbon it is.

08:30.056 --> 08:32.023
Do you really think
you can trick my friends

08:32.025 --> 08:34.107
into thinking I'm fine?

08:34.110 --> 08:35.643
Someone's gonna notice that I'm gone,

08:35.645 --> 08:38.111
and when they do, they'll track me here.

08:38.114 --> 08:40.948
Well, not within the next few hours,

08:40.951 --> 08:43.683
by which time, you'll be free of vervain,

08:43.686 --> 08:45.236
and I'll be able to compel you

08:45.238 --> 08:47.155
to forget everything, including all manner

08:47.157 --> 08:48.740
of tortures and punishments I might

08:48.742 --> 08:50.241
yet employ should you continue

08:50.243 --> 08:53.211
to prove disrespectful.

08:55.048 --> 08:57.215
That'll be the nanny.

09:03.640 --> 09:06.540
This is Anton, a very loyal

09:06.542 --> 09:08.732
and very dangerous friend.

09:08.762 --> 09:12.013
Tread carefully, oh, and, uh, Anton,

09:12.015 --> 09:13.798
if you should not hear
from my by nightfall,

09:13.800 --> 09:15.567
go on and kill her...

09:17.486 --> 09:19.637
But do it quickly. Oh, and for God's sake,

09:19.639 --> 09:21.489
don't ask if she has any final words.

09:21.491 --> 09:23.474
You'll be here through the weekend.

09:31.867 --> 09:34.119
You said you'd be here 15 minutes ago.

09:34.121 --> 09:36.154
I got held up. What's the problem?

09:36.156 --> 09:37.488
The problem is that there's a new group

09:37.490 --> 09:38.823
of vampires in town.

09:38.825 --> 09:41.209
Oh, The Strix? Come on, Marcel.

09:41.211 --> 09:42.660
You think the ancestors

09:42.662 --> 09:44.295
wouldn't give me a heads-up?

09:44.297 --> 09:46.131
Did the ancestors also give you a heads-up

09:46.133 --> 09:48.666
that The Strix are looking for you?

09:48.668 --> 09:50.218
The Strix want you to help them

09:50.220 --> 09:51.502
take down the Mikaelsons.

09:51.504 --> 09:53.337
Now, if you say no, they will kill you.

09:53.339 --> 09:56.340
If you say yes, Klaus will
do something much worse.

09:56.342 --> 09:58.643
Please, D., let me help
you get out of town.

09:58.645 --> 10:01.012
I'm not going anywhere.

10:01.014 --> 10:02.814
Marcel, you still see
me as this little girl

10:02.816 --> 10:04.515
in the attic.

10:04.517 --> 10:07.018
I'm not that girl anymore.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.854
I don't run from anyone.

10:16.079 --> 10:19.435
Hey, Hope is down for a nap.

10:19.465 --> 10:20.266
I thought if I leave now,

10:20.296 --> 10:22.017
I could be back in time for dinner.

10:22.219 --> 10:24.502
I can't believe you're
seriously considering this.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.537
I want to be here with you and Hope,

10:26.539 --> 10:28.962
but I can't just do nothing,

10:28.992 --> 10:31.376
and, Jack, those sire-line losers

10:31.378 --> 10:32.711
- took Rebekah.
- Yeah.

10:32.713 --> 10:35.046
They also went after you.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.037
Look. Let Klaus and Elijah handle this.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.584
Rebekah kept Hope safe for months.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.753
She's my friend, and she's Hope's family.

10:41.905 --> 10:43.938
I'm not gonna look my daughter

10:43.940 --> 10:46.224
in the eye one day and explain to her

10:46.226 --> 10:47.725
that I sat back and did nothing

10:47.727 --> 10:50.346
while those people just kidnapped

10:50.376 --> 10:53.540
- her aunt.
- Hayley, you didn't do nothing.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.451
You kept your daughter safe.

10:56.453 --> 10:59.737
You let Klaus do things his way.

10:59.739 --> 11:03.174
This dinner is gonna be a bloodbath,

11:03.176 --> 11:04.592
and last time I checked, the Mikaelsons

11:04.594 --> 11:07.942
didn't need any help killing anyone.

11:09.157 --> 11:12.172
Look, babe. It's Thanksgiving.

11:12.202 --> 11:15.804
I... I don't see where
this has to be a fight.

11:15.806 --> 11:18.840
It doesn't. I hear you.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.022
Ah, flowers for me. You shouldn't have.

11:34.024 --> 11:35.990
That's for the lady of the house.

11:35.992 --> 11:37.391
The well-mannered bring a gift

11:37.393 --> 11:38.693
when invited to dinner.

11:38.695 --> 11:41.112
I assume you brought nothing.

11:41.114 --> 11:43.653
Nothing but my deepest respect for you.

11:43.683 --> 11:45.567
Lovely. We're all getting along.

11:45.569 --> 11:47.402
Mm, like a fuse and a match.

11:47.404 --> 11:50.071
I take it Aurora is on her way.

11:50.073 --> 11:52.657
I'm sorry I'm late. Just freshening up.

11:52.659 --> 11:55.193
I did want to look pretty.

11:57.630 --> 11:59.214
Well, well.

11:59.216 --> 12:02.033
If it isn't my old friend Lucien.

12:02.035 --> 12:06.669
Hello, Aurora. It's been ages.

12:07.051 --> 12:08.006
You look...

12:08.008 --> 12:11.476
You look ravishing.

12:16.265 --> 12:18.216
Welcome to our home.

12:18.218 --> 12:21.219
I do wish it was under
better circumstances.

12:21.221 --> 12:23.271
We all face a common threat...

12:24.137 --> 12:27.518
A prophecy warning that my siblings and I

12:27.548 --> 12:30.829
would all fall within a year.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.865
I fear my sister already has.

12:33.867 --> 12:37.235
Only as a precautionary
measure, I assure you.

12:37.237 --> 12:38.670
Interesting.

12:38.672 --> 12:40.004
You see, I would have called it

12:40.006 --> 12:42.123
an entirely unnecessary measure.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.708
We need to unite to prevent

12:43.710 --> 12:45.510
the prophecy from coming to pass,

12:45.512 --> 12:47.212
and since any alliance is impossible

12:47.214 --> 12:49.714
without honesty, let us begin

12:49.716 --> 12:51.549
this evening's proceedings by formally

12:51.551 --> 12:56.104
acknowledging your clandestine alliance.

12:58.023 --> 13:00.024
Now, gentlemen, before...

13:00.026 --> 13:01.425
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

13:01.427 --> 13:03.862
Lucien, please.

13:03.864 --> 13:06.731
Let's not ruin the dinner before it begins.

13:06.733 --> 13:09.067
And do try to bear in
mind, we expect an honest

13:09.069 --> 13:11.808
and productive negotiation this evening.

13:11.838 --> 13:12.838
Mm-hmm.

13:15.058 --> 13:17.008
Shall we begin?

14:08.179 --> 14:09.742
Mm-hmm.

14:10.043 --> 14:12.532
Do I look like I need company?

14:12.562 --> 14:14.112
I tracked you down.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.552
Least you can do is hear me out.

14:15.582 --> 14:17.582
Forgive me if I don't feel like drinking

14:17.584 --> 14:19.618
with one of your kind.

14:20.142 --> 14:23.421
I don't care if you don't like me.

14:25.958 --> 14:27.627
Some new vampires are in the Quarter

14:27.657 --> 14:30.468
from out of town, way out of town,

14:30.498 --> 14:33.715
and they want the Regent on their side,

14:33.717 --> 14:36.101
and if Davina says no,

14:36.103 --> 14:38.019
they're going to kill her,

14:38.021 --> 14:39.865
and I want her to leave town,

14:39.895 --> 14:42.542
but she would rather, of
course, stay and fight,

14:42.572 --> 14:44.529
and I'd rather not sit back

14:44.559 --> 14:48.730
and watch her get herself killed.

14:51.033 --> 14:54.435
There might be a way to
get her out of trouble,

14:54.437 --> 14:56.955
but you ain't gonna like it.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.294
It's a bit odd, isn't it,

15:01.324 --> 15:02.892
celebrating an American holiday?

15:02.922 --> 15:06.114
Well, you know, Lucien, I
rather enjoy Thanksgiving...

15:06.116 --> 15:08.783
the turkey, the cranberry sauce,

15:08.785 --> 15:12.620
the lies, the deceit, the betrayal.

15:14.257 --> 15:15.893
Perhaps we should begin
this evening's proceedings

15:15.923 --> 15:19.894
with a little confession,
and do help yourselves.

15:19.896 --> 15:21.165
So this entire dinner is meant to be

15:21.195 --> 15:23.253
some boorish inquisition.

15:23.283 --> 15:24.599
How rude.

15:24.601 --> 15:26.151
Nonsense, luv.

15:26.153 --> 15:27.625
My brother merely wishes to make certain

15:27.655 --> 15:28.914
we're all on the same page,

15:28.944 --> 15:32.074
so who would like to begin?

15:32.076 --> 15:33.708
Well, Lucien and I

15:33.710 --> 15:35.911
have always loathed each other.

15:35.913 --> 15:38.819
Had we arrived as allies
with news of a bleak future,

15:38.849 --> 15:40.382
you would have doubted us.

15:40.384 --> 15:42.217
We sought to remove suspicion

15:42.219 --> 15:43.474
by maintaining appearances.

15:43.504 --> 15:46.471
Oh, my. Dear, these pathetic lies promise

15:46.473 --> 15:47.856
to be as difficult to swallow

15:47.858 --> 15:49.641
as your stuffing this year, Niklaus.

15:49.643 --> 15:51.259
- Walnuts. Honestly.
- Ha ha ha!

15:51.261 --> 15:53.628
The bottom line is, we came to protect you

15:53.658 --> 15:55.240
and ourselves.

15:55.242 --> 15:56.947
We have never wavered on this point.

15:56.977 --> 15:59.244
And the bodies on my streets,

15:59.246 --> 16:01.280
is that your protection, as well?

16:01.282 --> 16:03.699
It's business as usual for The Strix.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.318
An old tactic used often
and to great success...

16:06.320 --> 16:08.287
Jack the Ripper, Son of Sam.

16:08.289 --> 16:12.162
A frightened human populace
is that much easier to control.

16:12.192 --> 16:14.493
If tourism should decline
and the local vampires

16:14.495 --> 16:18.330
are deprived of fresh blood, well,

16:18.332 --> 16:21.049
you saw how quickly
Marcel joined our ranks.

16:21.051 --> 16:22.200
Pedestrian.

16:22.202 --> 16:23.302
I would've expected more

16:23.304 --> 16:24.870
from such gaudy theatrics.

16:24.872 --> 16:28.090
Well, if one wanted to
obtain a certain item

16:28.092 --> 16:29.808
in, say, a private collection

16:29.810 --> 16:31.677
but one was not invited to the home

16:31.679 --> 16:34.596
where said private collection was located,

16:34.598 --> 16:36.882
police investigation
could come in very handy

16:36.884 --> 16:39.685
to remove these items as evidence.

16:39.687 --> 16:42.721
I take it that you are
referring to the medallion.

16:43.656 --> 16:45.724
I suppose it was my sister

16:45.726 --> 16:48.026
who shared that bit of information.

16:48.028 --> 16:49.695
Don't blame Aurora.

16:49.697 --> 16:52.230
You two are hardly conspiratorial geniuses.

16:52.232 --> 16:54.583
Funny story... it turns out all along

16:54.585 --> 16:58.420
that the medallion was in the
hands of Nik's friend Camille

16:58.422 --> 17:00.873
the bartender-slash-therapist.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.258
Had to get her arrested in
order to search her goodies,

17:03.260 --> 17:05.242
so to speak,

17:05.244 --> 17:08.747
but I would never allow
any harm to come to her,

17:08.749 --> 17:11.717
knowing the great
affection you have for her.

17:15.438 --> 17:18.973
Seriously? Football? You're a vampire.

17:18.976 --> 17:20.858
Shut up and get me a beer.

17:20.861 --> 17:24.146
Razzle dazzle from butch Jones. What a...

17:24.147 --> 17:26.732
Should I find another
way to quench my thirst?

17:26.733 --> 17:30.602
37 yards, Cincinnati back on top.

17:30.604 --> 17:32.788
First of all, where can they go

17:32.790 --> 17:34.439
but up the center?

17:37.611 --> 17:40.829
So the lefty with the dump-off pass,

17:40.831 --> 17:43.799
what a gutsy call and great execution.

17:47.921 --> 17:50.756
I can't kill you, but I can hurt you...

17:50.758 --> 17:54.059
break bones, slice up your pretty face,

17:54.061 --> 17:57.145
heal you, then do it all over again.

17:57.147 --> 18:00.399
Next time, that's how this goes down.

18:00.401 --> 18:02.968
Got it?

18:02.970 --> 18:04.469
Got it.

18:04.471 --> 18:06.154
Drink up.

18:06.156 --> 18:08.941
You ain't going anywhere.

18:08.943 --> 18:11.777
A medallion that could lock us away

18:11.779 --> 18:13.979
hardly seems like a wise strategy

18:13.981 --> 18:17.115
for those come to protect us.

18:17.117 --> 18:18.650
Hand it over.

18:18.652 --> 18:21.086
And release Rebekah.

18:21.088 --> 18:26.925
Uh, just a tick. Aurora has Rebekah, hmm?

18:26.927 --> 18:30.328
No reason why I shouldn't be
trusted with my sire's safety.

18:30.330 --> 18:32.297
Of course,

18:32.299 --> 18:35.017
unless you were to have
one of your episodes.

18:35.019 --> 18:36.385
Easy, Lucien.

18:36.387 --> 18:38.020
My sister sought leverage
to protect herself.

18:38.022 --> 18:39.938
Who among us would do otherwise?

18:39.940 --> 18:41.473
Niklaus, would you politely remind me

18:41.475 --> 18:43.108
why we shouldn't just compel them all

18:43.110 --> 18:45.176
to give us what we want?

18:45.178 --> 18:48.346
Ha ha ha!

18:48.348 --> 18:51.400
I'm sorry. Did Elijah
say something amusing?

18:51.402 --> 18:54.019
We lost a century to compulsion, my love,

18:54.021 --> 18:57.572
and some of us lost a great deal more.

18:57.574 --> 18:59.291
Surely you can't believe
we'd allow ourselves

18:59.293 --> 19:01.043
to come here vulnerable.

19:01.045 --> 19:02.411
My dearest Aurora,

19:02.413 --> 19:04.296
compulsion is not my only party trick.

19:04.298 --> 19:05.914
I do not like these threats.

19:05.916 --> 19:10.419
Our continued existence
depends on the Mikaelsons.

19:10.421 --> 19:12.004
We've known that since Finn and Kol died.

19:12.006 --> 19:15.424
Unfortunately, so does every
other vampire in the world.

19:15.426 --> 19:17.926
Given that the sire lines have declared war

19:17.928 --> 19:20.211
against one another,
you can imagine how many

19:20.213 --> 19:23.715
young upstarts have come
to the same conclusion...

19:23.717 --> 19:27.686
kill an Original, wipe out
an entire line of rivals.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.105
Heavy burden, isn't it,
the lives of thousands

19:30.107 --> 19:34.159
of sired vampires
resting on your shoulders?

19:34.161 --> 19:37.129
In a perfect world, you'd allow us

19:37.131 --> 19:42.300
to seal you away forever,
thus eliminating the threat.

19:42.302 --> 19:45.687
Fortunately, the world is far from perfect.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.484
Anything?

19:59.486 --> 20:01.036
I can't find the continent she's on,

20:01.038 --> 20:02.254
let alone the city.

20:02.256 --> 20:03.538
Maybe you just need something of hers,

20:03.540 --> 20:05.040
maybe a... a hair brush or...

20:05.042 --> 20:08.543
her blood is in my veins.
That should be enough.

20:09.629 --> 20:11.830
Wait. Hey, Freya,

20:11.832 --> 20:14.165
you can't just give up.

20:14.167 --> 20:17.386
I'm not giving up.

20:21.774 --> 20:24.726
What did you want?

20:24.728 --> 20:27.396
Marcel told me what was going on.

20:27.398 --> 20:30.115
Mm, and you decided to care?

20:30.117 --> 20:32.484
This is witch business, Vincent.

20:32.486 --> 20:34.619
You don't even practice anymore...

20:36.456 --> 20:38.573
And as for The Strix,

20:38.575 --> 20:40.625
if they come after me, I'll deal with it.

20:40.627 --> 20:42.961
I'm not afraid.

20:45.214 --> 20:47.466
Maybe you should be.

20:49.201 --> 20:50.459
You trying to scare me?

20:50.489 --> 20:51.282
No, Davina.

20:51.312 --> 20:53.443
I'm trying to warn you,
but you don't like it

20:53.473 --> 20:54.772
when people disagree with you.

20:54.802 --> 20:56.045
From what I hear, you get pretty mad.

20:56.075 --> 20:58.543
What makes me mad is getting lectured

20:58.545 --> 21:01.897
by the guy who walked
away from being a witch.

21:03.399 --> 21:05.767
Well, then I best be careful,

21:05.769 --> 21:07.385
or else I'm gonna end
up like all the people

21:07.387 --> 21:10.272
you got mad at last time, right?

21:10.274 --> 21:13.108
Kara Nguyen attacked me.

21:13.110 --> 21:15.577
So you had her killed?

21:15.579 --> 21:17.496
You gonna kill anybody who
disagrees with you, Davina?

21:17.498 --> 21:20.699
I took care of a threat.

21:20.701 --> 21:23.452
That's what leaders do,

21:23.454 --> 21:26.455
and if anyone tries to stand against me,

21:26.457 --> 21:29.207
I'll do it again.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.435
Funny thing about a willow hoop...

21:40.437 --> 21:43.054
never know what you're gonna see.

21:49.145 --> 21:52.030
Told you I'd find out what you did.

21:52.032 --> 21:55.033
Now everyone else knows, too.

21:56.653 --> 21:58.286
With all the nauseating
dinner theater we've endured

21:58.288 --> 21:59.938
throughout the centuries,
these performances

21:59.940 --> 22:02.240
are, by far, the worst.

22:02.242 --> 22:04.793
Aurora, my sister...

22:04.795 --> 22:06.945
Aurora is quite aware

22:06.947 --> 22:09.247
of our desire to see Rebekah home,

22:09.249 --> 22:10.799
and I'm sure she'll do everything

22:10.801 --> 22:13.218
in her power to oblige.

22:16.006 --> 22:19.591
We're welcoming our enemies
to the dinner table now?

22:19.593 --> 22:22.844
Convenient, given she's the
one who has the answers I want.

22:22.846 --> 22:24.646
Oh, for heaven's sake,

22:24.648 --> 22:26.982
now I have to deal with
the long-lost sister?

22:26.984 --> 22:29.734
Nik, please spare me your
family's rage and paranoia.

22:29.736 --> 22:31.987
It is exactly this kind of lunacy

22:31.989 --> 22:33.972
which led me to steal
Rebekah in the first place.

22:33.974 --> 22:35.440
What did you do with her?

22:35.442 --> 22:37.325
Oh, I'm sorry, luv, but this prophecy

22:37.327 --> 22:39.327
has you all acting as fools,

22:39.329 --> 22:43.081
and I've no intention of
risking my life to foolishness.

22:43.083 --> 22:45.500
Now, I can't trust Rebekah with any of you,

22:45.502 --> 22:48.036
and I certainly can't trust the silly dear

22:48.038 --> 22:50.338
to endure on her own, so I decided

22:50.340 --> 22:53.157
to put her someplace safe.

22:53.159 --> 22:56.211
Imagine a spot where no
harm could come to her,

22:56.213 --> 23:00.849
where, in fact, no one could
possibly even track her down.

23:00.851 --> 23:04.052
Yes. Rest assured, Rebekah
is perfectly fine...

23:06.722 --> 23:09.724
at the bottom of the ocean.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.856
You're bluffing.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.660
Tell me you're bluffing.

23:23.662 --> 23:25.862
Oh, you should all be thanking me.

23:25.864 --> 23:28.364
Rebekah's never been safer.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.999
She has plenty of company down there.

23:30.001 --> 23:33.202
There's all the little
crabs and octopus and...

23:33.204 --> 23:37.040
Harm my sister, and I'll be
forced to return the favor.

23:39.790 --> 23:41.610
Oh, this all escalated very quickly.

23:41.612 --> 23:43.611
Shut up, Lucien, or I'll tear

23:43.641 --> 23:44.631
your tongue from your head.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.466
Be careful with your threats, Nik.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.051
Anything should happen to me,

23:48.053 --> 23:50.119
I won't be able to
protect your precious Cami.

23:50.121 --> 23:52.188
Ok. That is the second
time I've heard her name.

23:52.190 --> 23:53.956
Just who is this Cami?

23:53.958 --> 23:56.809
You have bigger problems.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.128
- Freya!
- Niklaus...

24:00.005 --> 24:01.797
Which of these two vulgar parasites

24:01.799 --> 24:05.351
would you first like to torture?

24:05.353 --> 24:06.819
Well, it's half a dozen of one

24:06.821 --> 24:08.855
and 6 of the other, isn't it?

24:08.857 --> 24:12.075
Why don't you take the stable boy?

24:12.989 --> 24:16.245
Tristan and I are long
overdue a good catch-up.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.365
Oh, if anything happens to Camille...

24:19.367 --> 24:21.918
Oh, I'm quite certain Lucien's aware,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.921
devastating error.

24:30.583 --> 24:32.929
You all heard her.

24:34.024 --> 24:36.716
She admitted it herself.

24:37.368 --> 24:40.085
Davina Claire is a murderer.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.122
No. I... I was trying to stop a mutiny.

24:43.124 --> 24:45.002
I'm sorry for what happened,
but it was my responsibility...

24:45.032 --> 24:48.260
It's over, Davina.

24:49.512 --> 24:51.136
You kill a witch, you lose your place

24:51.166 --> 24:53.967
among the witches.

24:53.969 --> 24:56.336
For what you've done,
you need to be shunned.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.425
When Aurora wakes, you will convince her

25:02.427 --> 25:04.377
to return my sister.

25:05.473 --> 25:07.764
Oh, would that it were so simple.

25:07.766 --> 25:09.599
Aurora has made it clear she means

25:09.601 --> 25:11.434
to control her own fate.

25:11.436 --> 25:14.553
I presume that includes keeping

25:14.555 --> 25:16.940
her own counsel, as well.

25:16.942 --> 25:19.075
I think she might be more amenable

25:19.077 --> 25:22.412
if she's forced to watch as
I tear you limb from limb.

25:22.414 --> 25:24.730
You could torture me, but even if my sister

25:24.732 --> 25:27.417
decided to return yours as a result,

25:27.419 --> 25:29.335
Rebekah's homecoming would be marred

25:29.337 --> 25:30.670
by The Strix, who would descend

25:30.672 --> 25:32.505
upon the city like a plague of locusts,

25:32.507 --> 25:35.649
killing whomever stood in their way.

25:35.679 --> 25:39.178
Violence is unavoidable, then.

25:39.180 --> 25:41.047
Well, I tried.

25:41.049 --> 25:42.966
Think, Niklaus.

25:42.968 --> 25:44.300
All these threats,

25:44.302 --> 25:45.852
this needless escalation of violence,

25:45.854 --> 25:47.720
we play into the worst possible outcome

25:47.722 --> 25:49.639
of this prophecy.

25:49.641 --> 25:51.774
There's a better solution.

25:51.776 --> 25:53.526
What might that be?

25:53.528 --> 25:55.645
We cannot prevent fate,

25:55.647 --> 25:58.031
but we can take control of it.

25:58.033 --> 25:59.949
Keep your siblings alive

25:59.951 --> 26:01.534
by helping me seal them away.

26:01.536 --> 26:04.153
Let them fall only for the year

26:04.155 --> 26:05.872
and leave yourself free

26:05.874 --> 26:08.291
to stand guard over them.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.994
If you care for them at all,

26:10.996 --> 26:14.047
it really is your only choice.

26:17.749 --> 26:20.386
No doubt you're angry...

26:21.221 --> 26:23.890
Rightfully so.

26:23.892 --> 26:25.508
For what it's worth, I was horrified

26:25.510 --> 26:27.810
by Aurora's thoughtless actions,

26:27.812 --> 26:32.015
but, I assure you,

26:32.017 --> 26:34.684
Cami will be fine, provided I'm allowed

26:34.686 --> 26:36.635
to leave here with my head intact.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.321
Give me Camille and the medallion,

26:38.323 --> 26:41.157
and then we may consider
the future of your head.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.914
Elijah, I have always been consistent.

26:47.916 --> 26:49.699
I only wanted to stop the prophecy

26:49.701 --> 26:51.534
to thereby save myself.

26:51.536 --> 26:52.869
And how do I know that
you're not the author

26:52.871 --> 26:54.337
of this very prophecy?

26:54.339 --> 26:57.256
Alexis was your little fortune teller,

26:57.258 --> 26:59.175
and anything that may have come to pass

26:59.177 --> 27:00.543
could be the result of your own

27:00.545 --> 27:02.178
duplicitous, little games.

27:02.180 --> 27:04.430
Well, you give me far too much credit

27:04.432 --> 27:06.215
for being clever.

27:06.217 --> 27:08.334
Instead consider the rift

27:08.336 --> 27:10.853
between Niklaus and yourself,

27:10.855 --> 27:13.339
made worse, thanks to Aurora.

27:13.341 --> 27:16.526
One shall fall by family.

27:16.528 --> 27:18.177
That does not bode well for you.

27:18.179 --> 27:19.562
What ever differences we have

27:19.564 --> 27:22.315
and how ever smitten my brother may be...

27:24.351 --> 27:27.787
I am certain Niklaus will
always put family first.

27:28.567 --> 27:29.622
Really?

27:29.624 --> 27:31.624
Aurora drops your sister
in the bottom of the ocean,

27:31.626 --> 27:33.376
yet Klaus does not seem
particularly inclined

27:33.378 --> 27:36.796
to make her suffer for it.

27:37.998 --> 27:41.551
I wonder why.

27:50.227 --> 27:51.677
Mm...

27:54.265 --> 27:56.265
Took you long enough.

27:56.267 --> 27:59.602
Oh, are we to play a fun game?

27:59.604 --> 28:03.289
Actually, yes, and now that my spell

28:03.291 --> 28:07.543
has made it so that no one
can hear what happens...

28:07.545 --> 28:10.963
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

28:12.639 --> 28:14.684
Hayley,

28:14.686 --> 28:16.836
the mother of Niklaus' child.

28:16.838 --> 28:19.021
Ooh, I was really hoping
I'd get to meet you.

28:19.023 --> 28:21.224
Feeling's not mutual.

28:21.226 --> 28:23.643
Oh, ok, so then what,

28:23.645 --> 28:26.312
pray tell, are we doing here?

28:27.252 --> 28:30.349
You're gonna tell us where to find Rebekah,

28:30.351 --> 28:34.287
or we're going to kill you.

28:34.289 --> 28:36.956
Oh. Hmm.

28:43.077 --> 28:44.544
"By order of the law set forth

28:44.546 --> 28:46.412
"by the ancestors, in accordance

28:46.414 --> 28:48.682
"to the decree of the nine covens,

28:48.684 --> 28:51.051
"Davina Claire, you are henceforth banished

28:51.053 --> 28:52.852
"from this community.

28:52.854 --> 28:54.804
"Your title is revoked, as is your link

28:54.806 --> 28:56.723
"to those that have come before.

28:56.725 --> 28:58.525
"You will no longer have contact

28:58.527 --> 29:00.643
"with the ancestors.

29:00.645 --> 29:04.794
"To the New Orleans witches, it will be

29:04.824 --> 29:06.066
as though you were never born."

29:06.068 --> 29:08.034
- Traitor! Traitor!
- Murderer!

29:16.778 --> 29:19.379
I'm sorry, Davina.

29:19.381 --> 29:21.548
It's time.

29:58.419 --> 30:00.724
- Uh!
- I'm gonna ask you again...

30:00.754 --> 30:02.756
where is Rebekah?

30:02.758 --> 30:05.675
You're quite strong for an infant.

30:05.677 --> 30:07.794
Ah! Uh...

30:07.796 --> 30:08.995
Uh...

30:08.997 --> 30:11.047
- Uh! Ah!
- Uh!

30:11.049 --> 30:12.665
Uh! Ah!

30:12.667 --> 30:14.017
- Agh!
- Oh!

30:14.019 --> 30:16.519
Rrgh! Ha!

30:17.972 --> 30:22.142
Ah! Uh! Huh!

30:22.144 --> 30:24.778
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

30:24.780 --> 30:27.030
That actually hurt. Ha ha!

30:27.032 --> 30:29.515
Oh, I haven't felt pain since the 1700s...

30:29.517 --> 30:31.484
kind of tickles...

30:31.486 --> 30:34.020
and for that, I'm gonna make you suffer.

30:34.022 --> 30:35.688
Huh! Agh!

30:35.690 --> 30:38.625
How about a werewolf bite,
you psychotic, little bitch?

30:38.627 --> 30:40.577
By all means if only I can laugh

30:40.579 --> 30:42.462
in your face when Nik heals me.

30:42.464 --> 30:44.831
Uh! Ah!

30:44.833 --> 30:47.083
Maybe Klaus would heal you,

30:47.085 --> 30:50.637
but I doubt he would heal your brother.

30:50.639 --> 30:52.839
Why don't you bite him instead?

30:52.841 --> 30:54.090
Hmm.

30:54.092 --> 30:56.059
No one should dare harm my brother...

30:58.729 --> 31:00.814
Seeing as you're all going to need him

31:00.816 --> 31:04.067
if you want your precious Rebekah back.

31:04.069 --> 31:06.152
It's quite the conundrum, isn't it?

31:06.154 --> 31:11.224
If I kill you, Aurora will be furious,

31:11.226 --> 31:13.610
and she's my sister's keeper.

31:13.612 --> 31:17.280
Not to mention the object
of your depraved desires,

31:17.282 --> 31:18.948
yet, despite all your time together,

31:18.950 --> 31:22.001
you hold no influence over her.

31:22.003 --> 31:25.255
I do, and once Elijah's safety is assured

31:25.257 --> 31:27.457
and, thus, mine, as
well, I'll convince Aurora

31:27.459 --> 31:30.076
to turn Rebekah over to us.

31:30.078 --> 31:32.212
And were I to dagger Elijah,

31:32.214 --> 31:36.216
were I to lock my brother in a box,

31:36.218 --> 31:38.968
that would fulfill 2/3 of the prophecy,

31:38.970 --> 31:43.189
leaving only little, old me.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.942
Perhaps you think I'd be an easier target

31:45.944 --> 31:47.977
if I were alone.

31:47.979 --> 31:50.196
That's not the first time
you'd have let siblings

31:50.198 --> 31:53.099
slumber while you toil
on, and in a year's time

31:53.101 --> 31:54.901
when the prophecy has passed and each

31:54.903 --> 31:57.403
of our fates secure, you may wake them

31:57.405 --> 32:00.323
at your own leisure if you so choose.

32:00.325 --> 32:03.076
That's very bold of you to suggest

32:03.078 --> 32:05.611
I betray my own blood.

32:06.484 --> 32:09.048
Perhaps I should kill you right now.

32:09.050 --> 32:11.417
Well, there is one thing

32:11.419 --> 32:14.254
I know which you do not

32:14.256 --> 32:17.840
with regard to your beloved sister.

32:17.842 --> 32:20.293
You see, while I did ensure that Rebekah

32:20.295 --> 32:22.929
was dropped in the ocean,

32:22.931 --> 32:25.131
I don't know precisely where.

32:25.133 --> 32:27.466
I had some old friends do it for me,

32:27.468 --> 32:29.435
and then I killed them.

32:29.437 --> 32:32.939
Aurora has procured the exact location

32:32.941 --> 32:37.810
of Rebekah's watery grave
in two sealed envelopes.

32:37.812 --> 32:40.446
Hers contained the latitude.

32:40.448 --> 32:43.116
And Tristan got the longitude.

32:43.118 --> 32:46.152
Thus, each of us has one half

32:46.154 --> 32:50.089
of the coordinates you
need to find your sister...

32:50.091 --> 32:52.658
"X" marks the spot.

32:52.660 --> 32:55.929
Assuming, of course,
you keep us both alive.

32:55.931 --> 32:58.348
So tell me, girls...

33:00.551 --> 33:03.502
Who has the advantage now?

33:16.717 --> 33:21.888
Longitude and latitude. Lovely.

33:21.890 --> 33:23.556
Well, despite our differences,

33:23.558 --> 33:25.091
I believe great strides

33:25.093 --> 33:26.826
- were made today.
- Hmm.

33:26.828 --> 33:28.833
Tristan, I can't murder
you this very moment,

33:28.863 --> 33:31.097
but I could just as
easily tear those eyeballs

33:31.099 --> 33:34.567
from your skull and
feed them to your sister.

33:34.569 --> 33:37.703
Elijah,

33:38.143 --> 33:41.206
these are our guests.

33:41.208 --> 33:44.376
Nik, it's so sweet of you to defend us.

33:46.346 --> 33:48.213
You know,

33:48.215 --> 33:50.650
I doubted my brother's
wisdom in bringing us

33:50.652 --> 33:53.853
all together today, but he was right.

33:53.855 --> 33:58.057
We must confront the
harsh realities we all face

33:58.059 --> 34:00.743
and make difficult choices...

34:01.828 --> 34:04.363
To ensure our collective survival...

34:11.672 --> 34:16.542
And I have every
confidence that my choice...

34:19.411 --> 34:22.835
Will be the right one.

34:26.187 --> 34:27.585
Were you anyone else, the servants would

34:27.588 --> 34:29.304
already be mopping your
blood from the floor.

34:29.306 --> 34:31.139
If you do not bring my sister home,

34:31.141 --> 34:34.264
Tristan will die slowly
and in tremendous pain.

34:34.295 --> 34:37.696
You betray me after all
your promises of love.

34:37.697 --> 34:39.536
I meant to keep those promises!

34:39.567 --> 34:41.100
It was you who shattered them

34:41.101 --> 34:43.235
when you took Rebekah!

34:43.237 --> 34:45.737
Now I have your brother,

34:45.739 --> 34:47.572
a sibling for a sibling.

34:47.574 --> 34:51.110
I want Rebekah back.

34:51.112 --> 34:53.411
You will regret this.

34:54.915 --> 34:56.315
Huh!

34:58.201 --> 35:01.320
After everything today,
you just let her go?

35:01.322 --> 35:03.455
Aurora should be easy enough to control.

35:03.457 --> 35:05.324
We have Tristan now.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.160
Lucien...

35:09.829 --> 35:11.997
You will take me to Camille,

35:11.999 --> 35:14.767
and you will surrender the medallion,

35:14.769 --> 35:17.519
or you will meet an end so cruel,

35:17.521 --> 35:20.339
the devil will weep.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.442
Thought I told you to sit still.

35:23.444 --> 35:25.527
No. You told me to drink,

35:25.529 --> 35:29.681
so I drank, and now I'm cleaning up.

35:31.066 --> 35:35.788
How much do you know about Klaus Mikaelson?

35:36.291 --> 35:40.192
Because the chances of Lucien coming back

35:40.194 --> 35:43.712
are, um, kind of slim.

35:45.286 --> 35:46.999
You better hope you're wrong,

35:47.001 --> 35:49.034
or you might not make it through the night.

35:49.036 --> 35:51.870
Oh, I don't think you want to hurt me.

35:51.872 --> 35:56.091
See, Klaus is the most ruthless vampire

35:56.093 --> 35:58.978
in all of history, and guess what.

35:58.980 --> 36:02.714
He kind of likes me, so maybe you

36:02.716 --> 36:04.984
should be the one worrying about

36:04.986 --> 36:07.853
whether or not you make
it through the night.

36:09.389 --> 36:11.690
You're a bad drunk.

36:11.692 --> 36:13.525
Oh!

36:13.527 --> 36:14.893
Aagh!

36:14.895 --> 36:16.228
I think I'm a pretty good drunk.

36:16.230 --> 36:18.030
Ooh!

36:18.032 --> 36:20.499
I'm gonna kill you.

36:20.501 --> 36:22.167
Oh...

36:22.169 --> 36:25.070
Not while the sun's still out.

36:38.051 --> 36:40.269
You must be Cami.

36:53.097 --> 36:55.432
Uh!

36:55.434 --> 36:59.774
Rrgh! Raagh! Where is she?

36:59.804 --> 37:02.655
I told you. She took my
daylight ring and ran.

37:02.657 --> 37:04.156
Uhh!

37:07.160 --> 37:09.144
This is your fault.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.746
Well, to be fair, if Cami had done

37:10.748 --> 37:12.331
as she was told, she'd still be here,

37:12.333 --> 37:14.450
so technically, it's her fault.

37:14.452 --> 37:16.318
Ah, ah. Now, you may hate me

37:16.320 --> 37:18.204
for involving your pretty friend,

37:18.206 --> 37:23.425
but I needed your full attention.

37:23.427 --> 37:25.261
You certainly don't listen to me,

37:25.263 --> 37:27.329
despite my nonstop efforts

37:27.331 --> 37:29.632
to keep you alive.

37:39.109 --> 37:41.560
If that really is the weapon

37:41.562 --> 37:44.363
that can lock me away for eternity,

37:44.365 --> 37:47.182
why hand it over?

37:47.184 --> 37:49.902
Proof of my loyalty.

37:49.904 --> 37:51.537
Yes. I sided with Tristan,

37:51.539 --> 37:53.188
but it's quite clear his devotion to Aurora

37:53.190 --> 37:54.874
outweighs even the value he places

37:54.876 --> 37:58.244
on his own life.

37:58.778 --> 38:01.530
Take it. It's yours.

38:23.020 --> 38:25.070
Can you help her?

38:25.072 --> 38:26.939
If she lets me.

38:26.941 --> 38:30.442
I'm not holding my breath.
She's been through a lot.

38:30.444 --> 38:33.329
She's alive. That's what counts.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.748
Yeah.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.917
We'll keep telling
ourselves that, won't we?

38:47.678 --> 38:49.678
Cami?

38:49.680 --> 38:50.913
Camille?

38:58.756 --> 39:00.255
It's Cami. Leave a message.

39:00.257 --> 39:03.258
I need...

39:04.013 --> 39:06.645
I need to know you're safe.

39:06.647 --> 39:08.597
Call me back, please.

39:34.341 --> 39:36.342
Jack, I am so sorry.

39:36.344 --> 39:38.894
I thought I would be back in time.

39:38.896 --> 39:41.230
Is Hope still up?

39:42.465 --> 39:44.800
Hope's asleep.

39:44.802 --> 39:48.737
She cried a little bit
and finally went down.

39:48.739 --> 39:52.074
The family needed my help.

39:52.076 --> 39:54.777
I asked you for one thing today...

39:54.779 --> 39:56.495
just leave it be.

39:56.497 --> 39:58.146
Don't make it a fight. That's all I wanted.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.449
And I wanted to give that to you, but...

40:00.451 --> 40:03.285
but nothing. I should know this by now.

40:03.287 --> 40:07.089
No matter what Klaus does
to you, to me, to the pack,

40:07.091 --> 40:09.258
whenever the Mikaelsons come calling,

40:09.260 --> 40:11.677
you will always be there to answer.

40:16.466 --> 40:18.767
Where are you going?

40:18.769 --> 40:20.502
Out to the bayou.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.187
I figured I'd spend
the rest of this holiday

40:22.189 --> 40:24.139
with my family.

40:28.445 --> 40:30.696
Jack...

40:49.083 --> 40:50.532
Have you found Camille?

40:50.534 --> 40:52.534
Not yet, but I will.

40:52.536 --> 40:54.685
Niklaus, do you think it was wise,

40:54.715 --> 40:56.204
allowing Aurora to go free?

40:56.206 --> 40:58.373
With her brother
captured, she has no choice

40:58.375 --> 41:00.676
but to bring our sister home.

41:03.212 --> 41:05.431
Do you love her?

41:06.151 --> 41:08.717
My affections are not the point.

41:08.719 --> 41:10.436
What matters now is that we have

41:10.438 --> 41:14.323
this maddening prophecy under control.

41:14.325 --> 41:16.224
Perhaps.
