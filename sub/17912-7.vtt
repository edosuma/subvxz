WEBVTT

00:19.520 --> 00:23.424
Hello and welcome to
a Grand Tour special,

00:23.491 --> 00:26.427
which begins with this:
the Volkswagen Beetle.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.462
It's a car we hate very much

00:28.529 --> 00:31.999
because it appeals only
to Nazis and hippies,

00:32.066 --> 00:35.069
and we are neither
of those things.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.538
However,
if you remove the bodywork

00:37.605 --> 00:40.007
and replace it with something
a bit more fun -

00:40.074 --> 00:41.275
something like this--

00:41.342 --> 00:43.377
you end up with
a beach buggy,

00:43.444 --> 00:45.346
and that's brilliant.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.415
We love beach buggies.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.850
However, Mr. Wilman disagrees.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.120
He says that
if they'd been any good,

00:52.186 --> 00:53.554
they would have caught on,

00:53.621 --> 00:56.023
and he points out
that they didn't.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.827
So he hatched a plan.
And it's this:

00:59.893 --> 01:03.397
he said all three of us
must buy a Volkswagen Beetle,

01:03.464 --> 01:05.633
turn it into a beach buggy,

01:05.699 --> 01:06.867
and then report with it

01:06.934 --> 01:11.172
to a wild, rugged
and extremely remote place--

01:11.239 --> 01:14.675
here on the coast of Namibia.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.168
This is what I've built.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.971
It's as close
as you can possibly get

01:44.037 --> 01:47.175
to the original
1964 beach buggy

01:47.208 --> 01:48.809
built by Bruce Meyers.

01:51.379 --> 01:55.549
Underneath,
it is a 1950s Beetle--

01:55.616 --> 01:57.451
Beetle floorpan,
Beetle suspension,

01:57.518 --> 01:59.253
Beetle engine,
Beetle gearbox.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.621
It's got Beetle lights on it.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.290
I've even got
a Beetle speedometer

02:02.356 --> 02:04.192
and Beetle hubcaps.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.195
It's brilliant!

02:10.664 --> 02:14.535
This is a beach buggy
very like the one
that Steve McQueen drove

02:14.602 --> 02:16.337
in the original
Thomas Crown Affair.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.406
- And if it's good enough--

02:18.472 --> 02:22.009
- Oh, God.
- Ha-ha!

02:22.075 --> 02:24.612
I've been joined
by the 1970s.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.814
* T.REX: "20th Century Boy"

02:28.982 --> 02:30.251
Yes.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.655
James May has built
what a beach buggy was,

02:34.722 --> 02:37.891
what I've built is what
a beach buggy can be...

02:40.828 --> 02:43.431
...if you have
a bit of imagination

02:43.497 --> 02:46.234
and some purple
metal-flake paint.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.035
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

02:48.101 --> 02:53.907
* Twentieth century toy,
I wanna be your boy... *

02:53.974 --> 02:57.411
There, I believe,
is the start point
of our adventure.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.749
* I wanna be your boy... *

03:04.418 --> 03:06.820
JEREMY:
What an extraordinary place.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.424
It's amazing, isn't it?
I mean, more seals.

03:10.491 --> 03:13.060
What David Attenborough
never told us about those

03:13.126 --> 03:15.996
is how bad they smell.

03:16.063 --> 03:20.401
JEREMY: Sadly, before
our nature documentary
could go any further,

03:20.468 --> 03:23.571
Richard Hammond
emerged from the mist.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.907
Ooh, hello.
That's not a beach buggy.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.943
- Well, I wouldn't
call that...

03:30.010 --> 03:32.313
- Ah-ha!
- Oh, geez.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.947
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dick-tari!

03:35.048 --> 03:36.284
RICHARD: Behold!

03:37.285 --> 03:38.486
JAMES: What are you wearing?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.288
What are you wearing?

03:40.288 --> 03:41.489
Well, I'm in Africa!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.023
- These trousers,

03:43.090 --> 03:44.458
did they say in the shop,

03:44.525 --> 03:46.093
"I'm afraid
they are yellow, sir"?

03:46.159 --> 03:47.495
When you left,
they went, "Yes!

03:47.561 --> 03:50.197
20 years we've had
those on the hanger!"

03:50.298 --> 03:51.565
- Shut up.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.066
And then we must
move over to this.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.902
- Yeah.
- We were told

03:54.968 --> 03:56.904
to build beach buggies.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.572
- Yes.
- Beach buggies.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.441
JAMES: It's not a beach buggy.
JEREMY: It isn't.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.842
RICHARD: It is a beach buggy.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.611
It isn't a beach buggy.
It's got a roof!

04:03.677 --> 04:05.346
There's no Beetle
in here at all.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.515
Yes, there is.
Beetle engine in there.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.551
OK, this space-frame chassis...

04:10.618 --> 04:12.185
- Yeah.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.323
- No.
- These enormous
suspension components

04:15.389 --> 04:17.224
that don't even fit
under the bodywork.

04:17.325 --> 04:20.761
- You've got two lots
of suspension at the back.
- Twin shocks.

04:20.828 --> 04:24.965
- I like an off-road
sort of vibe.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.200
To get here,
we had to drive on a beach.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.802
-Yeah.
-Ours have made it.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.104
I didn't need two lots
of rear suspension on mine.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.373
Neither did I.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.207
Look, we were told
to come to Africa.

04:34.342 --> 04:38.979
If we'd been told to go
to Santa Monica Beach,
then this, with its...

04:40.113 --> 04:41.815
...incredibly vivid paint...

04:41.882 --> 04:44.051
That's the most metal flake
I've ever seen.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.353
Any beach in the world.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.020
Um...

04:47.087 --> 04:49.690
- That's the engine.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.225
- V8!

04:52.360 --> 04:53.961
I've put a V8
in a beach buggy!

04:54.027 --> 04:55.262
Well, no, you haven't.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.230
You've parked your
beach buggy quite close.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.566
It's not in it!

04:58.632 --> 04:59.933
- It isn't in it.
No.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.068
You've reversed into a V8,

05:01.134 --> 05:02.436
but not quite hard enough.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.004
It's only gone in
a third of the way.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.773
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

05:05.839 --> 05:07.808
to fit a V8 to a beach buggy?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.377
- Well, it doesn't fit!
- It's obviously impossible.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.978
Exactly, it's impossible.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.580
This is no ordinary V8.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.014
It started out in life

05:14.081 --> 05:16.149
as a 3.5 litre V8
from a Range Rover,

05:16.216 --> 05:21.288
but I've modified it,
so it produces
180 horsepower.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.256
Can I just say,
you were doubting

05:23.391 --> 05:25.092
the credibility of mine
as a beach buggy.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.494
Yeah.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.228
The defining characteristic
of a beach buggy

05:28.295 --> 05:30.831
is an air-cooled,
flat-four Beetle engine.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.401
No, that's not
an engine, James.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.602
That's just a fan.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.103
How many horsepower
does yours have?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.405
94!

05:37.438 --> 05:39.306
So I have twice
as many horsepower.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.542
- They're not in the car,
though.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.411
- They are, they're near it.
- Yes.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.746
It's interesting, isn't it?
I mean, that is an entire--

05:45.813 --> 05:47.080
Nothing about that
is interesting.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.416
This is a blank canvas

05:48.416 --> 05:49.483
onto which you could
paint your personality.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.118
- Yes.
- Yours has got

05:51.184 --> 05:52.886
a prolapsed V8 hanging
out of its backside

05:52.953 --> 05:54.121
and terrible paint.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.523
Mine is a rather magnificent

05:55.589 --> 05:56.890
"Daktari"-themed off-roader.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.292
That's got nothing on it!

05:59.427 --> 06:01.028
- You can express...
- JEREMY: It is a bit boring.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.696
...all your personality,
and it's standard.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.264
It's not...
What do you mean, standard?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.433
It's a beach buggy.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.867
- It's tasteful.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.101
What?

06:09.437 --> 06:12.105
- Oh.
- The bat sat-phone.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.641
We've got a message from...

06:14.508 --> 06:15.509
Mr. Wilman.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.844
RICHARD: Right, go on.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.245
"Since you're in
beach buggies..."

06:18.311 --> 06:19.913
Well, us two are.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.882
"Since you're
in beach buggies,

06:21.949 --> 06:25.052
you will now
drive to the beach."

06:25.118 --> 06:26.186
Uh...

06:26.253 --> 06:27.354
Uh...do you think

06:27.455 --> 06:28.956
he's taken leave
of his senses?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.791
Well, he was never that good
at geography, was he?

06:30.858 --> 06:32.893
No, he wasn't. "You'll now
drive to the beach."

06:32.960 --> 06:34.294
Hold on.
Oh, no, there's more.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.096
"The beach
to which you will drive

06:36.163 --> 06:41.168
is located on
the crocodile-infested
Kunene River

06:41.234 --> 06:46.139
at the northernmost
point of Namibia,
where it meets Angola.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.175
It's 1,000 miles away."

06:49.677 --> 06:53.180
- 1,000.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.116
JEREMY: What we needed
at this point was a map,

06:56.183 --> 06:59.219
so we decided
to head north up the coast

06:59.286 --> 07:01.054
and find the nearest town.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.491
JEREMY:
Let the journey begin!

07:07.895 --> 07:10.831
JEREMY: And what a journey
it would be in these cars,

07:10.898 --> 07:14.702
cars that were born
in interesting times.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.972
So, it's 1964,

07:19.039 --> 07:22.175
the word "teenager"
has started to appear

07:22.242 --> 07:23.644
in the world's dictionaries,

07:23.711 --> 07:26.547
people are listening
to new types of music,

07:26.614 --> 07:29.683
they're smoking
new types of stuff.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.954
And then, in California,
the beach buggy arrived!

07:39.192 --> 07:40.594
It was perfect!

07:40.661 --> 07:43.330
Girls and boys,
beach barbecues...

07:43.396 --> 07:46.900
The first design criteria
was that the front fenders
were flat,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.202
so you could stand
a beer on it.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.038
That's how you design a car!

07:54.842 --> 07:59.547
Jimi Hendrix had a beach buggy
and President Nixon didn't.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.549
Tells you
all you need to know.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.354
What I really like
about the beach buggy
is that it's a testament

08:07.420 --> 08:10.991
to the ability of
the human spirit to triumph.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.960
Because somebody looked
at the Beetle and said,

08:13.026 --> 08:17.364
"Well, that's the legacy of
the world's worst dictator.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.266
Let's turn it
into a beach car."

08:23.003 --> 08:24.805
JEREMY: After a lonely hour

08:24.872 --> 08:27.007
of driving north
through the swirling mist,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.677
we still hadn't found a town,

08:29.743 --> 08:32.880
but we did find
something else.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.583
Jesus.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.605
JEREMY: I'll tell you what,

08:57.671 --> 08:59.439
he must have been
going at a right old lick

08:59.506 --> 09:00.608
when he hit the beach.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.809
RICHARD: He must have been.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.811
Right, the sea is there.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.445
That's half a mile away.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.513
JAMES: I'd say so.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.848
So he got it up the beach,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.382
and then sort of did
a handbrake turn.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.685
-Power-slided it in.
-How do you do a handbrake...

09:11.752 --> 09:14.054
RICHARD: How did it
get here, seriously?

09:14.121 --> 09:16.857
Can I just say...
my nipples are erect.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.226
- What, 'cause
of this jacket?
- No.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.628
- Oh.
- It's cold.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.063
- It's cold.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.432
That's an unwise
wardrobe strategy.

09:25.498 --> 09:26.667
Yeah, well, you know,

09:26.734 --> 09:28.936
Africa, on a beach,
I thought...

09:29.002 --> 09:30.771
- So did I.
- I'm surprised.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.308
The beach has got
the sea haar on it -

09:35.375 --> 09:37.144
mist, fog, cold.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.313
- If you look over there...
- Hm.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.015
...sunshine, blue sky.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.652
- Why don't we just
go inland...
- The coast road.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.354
Find the coast road
which will take us
to a town.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.723
And that'll be in the sun.
That's a better idea.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.325
JEREMY:
With a plan worked out,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.662
it was time
to get moving again.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.067
Oh, dear.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.169
JAMES: Did you modify
the battery as well?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.304
- RICHARD: Oh...

10:04.371 --> 10:07.775
- It's obviously not
charging up.
- No.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.576
Because I didn't modify it.

10:09.643 --> 10:10.744
Yeah.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.512
I'll just see if mine works.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.449
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me just try mine.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.752
- Yeah.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.967
JEREMY: After the film crew
had got me going,

10:34.034 --> 10:37.971
I used my massive horsepower
to catch the others.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.247
But by the time we were
back together again...

10:48.448 --> 10:50.383
it was going dark.

10:50.450 --> 10:54.187
The sun, as you can see
over my shoulder, has set,

10:54.254 --> 10:56.724
and we still
haven't found a road.

10:56.790 --> 11:00.093
It's also going to be very,
very, very cold.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.096
Lights on.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.439
RICHARD: We have
got to find this road.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.876
This is not going to be
too clever...

11:17.144 --> 11:18.411
in the dark.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.120
I've rather crudely
rigged up my torch,

11:27.187 --> 11:29.923
wedged in
the windscreen rail,

11:29.990 --> 11:33.994
in the hope that you can see
my last pieces to camera.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.466
Oh, bollocks!

11:43.837 --> 11:45.405
Oh, cold!

11:49.042 --> 11:50.377
JEREMY: Finally, though,

11:50.443 --> 11:53.680
it looked like
our luck had changed.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.648
Ooh, hello! Hello!

11:55.783 --> 11:57.117
What's that?

12:03.623 --> 12:05.325
- It's not a hotel.
- No.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.462
It smells of excrement!

12:09.529 --> 12:10.630
JAMES: Oh, wow, look at this!

12:10.697 --> 12:12.800
There's still, like, plates

12:12.800 --> 12:14.201
and cups and saucers
and things in here.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.869
I'll tell you exactly
what this is.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.304
It's an abandoned mine.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.673
They do mine round
in Namibia, don't they?

12:20.808 --> 12:21.942
What do they mine for?

12:22.009 --> 12:23.543
- Diamonds.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.246
Yeah, but they wouldn't
have left if there were any.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.515
They obviously left,
and not yesterday.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.454
Look, there's no road here,
is there?

12:34.521 --> 12:35.488
- No.
- No.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.924
Apart from anything else,

12:36.990 --> 12:38.625
we can't find our way
around in the dark

12:38.691 --> 12:39.726
'cause we can't navigate.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.328
- Well, I can.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.963
- Stars.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.397
- No, you can't.
- I can.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.835
I can't do very many
things, I admit...

12:47.835 --> 12:49.837
...anything,
but I can do that.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.571
How do you navigate
by the stars?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.973
Uh...
find the Southern Cross.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.574
Yeah, but that's
really complicated.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.277
Right, do you want to sleep
in the excrement mine?

12:57.344 --> 12:58.645
No, this is out.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.380
So, we have to keep going,

13:00.447 --> 13:02.615
whether we like it or not,
till we find...

13:02.682 --> 13:04.251
We have to, so listen.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.753
I shall find
the Southern Cross.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.089
You can't find
the Southern Cross
with a hammer.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.959
I've found it!
Ha! I've found it.
It's there.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.560
It's like a kite.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.995
- Yeah.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.864
It's a kite shape.
It's sort of...

13:16.930 --> 13:20.733
Now, you take
the long axis, yes?

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
- Yes.
- Mm-hm.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.004
And draw an imaginary line

13:24.071 --> 13:27.474
through it,
down to the horizon.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.076
Yes? Now, you intersect it

13:29.142 --> 13:32.212
from a line drawn
between two other stars,

13:32.279 --> 13:35.048
and where those
two imaginary lines meet,

13:35.115 --> 13:38.618
directly underneath it
is due south.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.653
So if it's those two--

13:40.720 --> 13:42.455
which it is, I'm sure of it--

13:42.522 --> 13:44.491
you draw a line...

13:49.796 --> 13:52.399
Oh, this is a bad idea!

13:52.465 --> 13:55.135
We are now trusting
our lives to an orangutan

13:55.202 --> 13:57.004
who thinks
he's Patrick Moore.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.609
There it is.
There's the two stars.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.713
Draw a line...

14:06.779 --> 14:10.183
I'm not getting many
directions from you, Jeremy.
Is this right?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.920
You're heading a little bit
too much to the right.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.022
You need to go left a bit.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.991
Good, good.
Oh, I'm so confident.

14:18.058 --> 14:23.296
You two are going to be
eating humble pie
when the sun comes up.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.835
RICHARD: Despite
the confidence

14:28.936 --> 14:30.603
of Jeremy Columbus,

14:30.670 --> 14:33.040
no road appeared.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.076
Oh, this is grim.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.315
Excuse me.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.418
I've been on the go
a very, very long time now.

14:47.654 --> 14:52.125
RICHARD: Guys, I'm sorry.
I'm not driving another inch.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.994
I can't do this.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.495
It's three o'clock
in the morning.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.964
I'm exhausted.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.466
JEREMY: He does have a point.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.340
RICHARD: The next morning,

15:07.407 --> 15:10.043
we woke, having
slept on the sand,

15:10.110 --> 15:12.645
huddled round our engines
for warmth.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.310
JAMES:
You muppet. What's that?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.377
Um...

15:45.712 --> 15:48.015
"Um" what?

15:48.048 --> 15:51.084
I never knew
Namibia had two seas.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.519
It doesn't have two seas.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.187
No, it has one
massive "cee" in it.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.655
One massive, stupid "cee"

15:55.722 --> 15:57.657
that's navigated us back
to where we started.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.726
- Can I just say...
- It wasn't my... I...

15:59.792 --> 16:02.029
Why did we even believe
you could navigate
by the stars?

16:02.095 --> 16:03.430
You can't even
read a compass.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.099
There are two "cees".
There's two "cees" here

16:06.166 --> 16:08.268
for believing that
that "cee" could navigate us.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.370
- No, you're right.
- I couldn't possibly...

16:10.437 --> 16:12.872
Really,
I don't understand that.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.775
JAMES: Freezing cold,
sandpapered on the face...

16:15.842 --> 16:18.278
- You've got a coat on.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.180
I haven't even got
a thin coat.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.581
I've only got
a T-shirt. Anyway,

16:21.648 --> 16:23.150
I'm not going to be
competitive with you

16:23.216 --> 16:24.551
about who's the coldest.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.453
- I'm the coldest!
- We're all the lostest.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.821
Never mind. Look,
let's not get bogged down

16:28.888 --> 16:30.223
with whose fault it was.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.159
There's no being bogged
down with it, is there?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.127
It was yours.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.962
We can either go
back into the desert

16:36.063 --> 16:37.564
to look for a road,

16:37.630 --> 16:39.966
or we can just do what
we were doing yesterday,

16:40.067 --> 16:41.534
and stay on the beach.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.970
At least we know, if we
keep the sea on our left,

16:44.071 --> 16:45.238
we're going north.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.673
- Yes.
- That's a fair point.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.242
- Let's navigate by the sea.
- JEREMY: Yes.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.113
JEREMY: With our new--
well, newish--

16:53.180 --> 16:54.314
plan in place,

16:54.381 --> 16:56.183
we set off once more.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.754
So here we are. These are our
wheel marks from yesterday.

17:02.955 --> 17:06.393
24 hours of cold, misery...

17:06.459 --> 17:08.428
to achieve exactly nothing.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.131
I mean,
it is exactly nothing.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.501
But, apart from that
and the weather...

17:14.567 --> 17:19.406
and Jeremy Clarkson,
it's all going really well.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.274
JEREMY:
As we continued north,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.776
the misery of
the previous day was banished

17:23.843 --> 17:27.580
by the sheer bigness
of our surroundings.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.583
Oh, this is
an astonishing place.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.457
I've got a dune the size
of Mount Everest to my right,

17:37.524 --> 17:40.727
the Atlantic Ocean
to my left...

17:41.928 --> 17:44.697
This is absolutely epic.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.142
This is proper
beach buggy driving.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.611
Sun's out, sea's there
with the surf.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.580
It's like being
in the Beach Boys.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.554
JEREMY: Amidst all
this loveliness, though,

18:07.620 --> 18:12.825
there was one small elephant
edging its way into the room.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.727
Chaps, I don't want to
have to say this,

18:14.794 --> 18:18.231
but is the tide coming in
or going out?

18:20.167 --> 18:22.702
RICHARD:
Uh...I'm guessing in.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.307
There's no way
up the sides of that.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.011
And if the tide comes in
that far, which it does,

18:32.078 --> 18:34.181
we've had it.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.815
Got to keep moving here.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.517
We cannot afford
to get stuck.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.191
JEREMY: With some generous
use of the throttle,

18:44.191 --> 18:45.625
we managed to get clear

18:45.692 --> 18:48.595
of the sea-and-sand-dune
pincer movement.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.631
But then we had
another problem.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.703
I'd say that was the end
of the beach.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.772
RICHARD: How does that
just end like that?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.708
JEREMY: It does just end.
JAMES: That is the end.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.043
JEREMY: And the Namibian
government doesn't allow us

19:04.110 --> 19:06.679
to drive on the salt pans,
and that's what that is.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.315
This meant,
according to James,

19:08.381 --> 19:11.684
we had only one option.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.553
We've got to go back
the way we came.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.987
But if the tide's coming in,

19:15.054 --> 19:18.325
that narrow bit
will have become impassable.

19:18.391 --> 19:22.028
That's why I think
if we see a good opportunity
to turn left,

19:22.094 --> 19:24.364
like we did last night,
we do it.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.399
Are you honestly suggesting
we go back in the...

19:26.466 --> 19:28.235
Well, where else can we go?

19:28.235 --> 19:30.337
We'll either drown
or starve otherwise.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.677
Right, we've just
got to find a bit

19:37.744 --> 19:41.748
where we can get inland
before the tide comes in.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.822
That is getting closer
to that,

19:49.889 --> 19:51.624
and when that happens,
we've had it.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.964
RICHARD:
But as we thundered along,

19:58.030 --> 20:01.468
the dunes refused
to open up and let us in.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.504
That's the sea!

20:05.405 --> 20:07.274
It's the sea, there!

20:08.975 --> 20:10.510
Oh, it's coming at me!

20:12.211 --> 20:15.582
JEREMY: I still say
we can't get out here, look.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.550
No left turn at the moment.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.723
This is where you need a V8!

20:27.193 --> 20:28.395
Oh, shit.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.332
Oh, Jeremy's in trouble!

20:32.399 --> 20:34.100
That is not looking good!

20:35.435 --> 20:37.103
Come on, come on. Whoa.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.707
Oh, no.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.645
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Not a good place.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.114
- Oh, God.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.816
Uh...I'm in the sea.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.453
Because it was
a bit of an emergency,

20:53.520 --> 20:56.255
my colleagues
decided to help for once.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.058
- Go.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.192
JAMES: No.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.894
Is that just spinning?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.530
It's beached under there.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.498
I don't see why
I can't push him with that.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.800
-All right, then. Try.
-All right.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.569
James, count us in.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.038
Three, two, one, away!

21:17.644 --> 21:20.347
JEREMY: Yes!
RICHARD: Right, let's go!

21:22.349 --> 21:27.086
Me getting beached cost us
time we never had
in the first place,

21:27.153 --> 21:29.422
and we were still trapped.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.060
Jesus Christ.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.830
Ah, it's coming in.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.670
Come on, come on, come on.

21:45.204 --> 21:46.506
Come on.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.075
Whoa!

21:54.381 --> 21:55.615
Oh!

21:57.249 --> 21:58.518
Oh, that's bad.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.222
Shit.

22:05.925 --> 22:06.993
Whoa!

22:09.629 --> 22:11.097
Come on, baby, come on.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.504
RICHARD:
Mercifully, the dunes finally
started to fall away

22:17.570 --> 22:19.572
and we were saved.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.512
-And we're through!
-We are, we are.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.879
That's a relief.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.083
So nearly got stuck then.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.657
RICHARD: We'd now been
on the go for 36 hours,

22:37.724 --> 22:42.662
and we were
pretty much back where
we started from... again.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.665
We were also soaked,
frozen, worn out,

22:45.732 --> 22:47.667
and because
we had no food with us,

22:47.734 --> 22:49.802
we were also hungry.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.706
But then Bear Clarkson
came to the rescue.

22:53.773 --> 22:57.243
Cold you go and get
some driftwood for a fire?

22:57.309 --> 23:01.180
And could you fashion
a rudimentary barbecue
grill of some sort?

23:01.247 --> 23:03.716
OK. Where did you get
the fishing rod from?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.885
It's my whip aerial.
It's a beach buggy.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.154
- I thought of that.
- They're fishing rods.

23:15.795 --> 23:18.598
This is going to make
a perfect little
fish grill thing, look.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.137
Have you got a fire lit yet?

23:25.204 --> 23:26.473
I thought you were fishing.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.741
I am fishing.
My car's fishing.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.843
- Look.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.079
- Yeah, look,
I've got the rods attached.
- It's parked.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.014
JEREMY: What's that?
JAMES: That's the grill.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.650
So we hold that
with the pliers
from my multi-tool,

23:37.717 --> 23:39.652
cut the fish up, fillet it...

23:39.719 --> 23:43.556
Can you do that?
There's no point asking him.
He can open a tin...

23:43.623 --> 23:45.024
Can you fillet a fish?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.159
- Well, it's the sea!

23:47.226 --> 23:49.829
What did you think I was
going to catch, a chicken?

23:49.896 --> 23:51.063
Oh, my God!

23:56.268 --> 23:59.506
RICHARD: Oh, my God!
JAMES: No, wait. Yes!

23:59.506 --> 24:01.708
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

24:01.774 --> 24:04.043
While Hammond went off
to get more driftwood,

24:04.110 --> 24:07.614
James and I set about
gutting the catch.

24:07.680 --> 24:11.283
JEREMY: Use his car
as the table. There we go.

24:11.350 --> 24:14.420
- That's his gut.
Look. You've got it.
- Yeah, right.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.022
Oh, God. Shit. Look,

24:16.088 --> 24:17.857
it's all gone literally
onto his exhaust.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.359
Oh, no. Never mind.
Look, I need your help.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.794
Right, saw its head off.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.866
- Ah, there we go.
- Excellent.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.135
- I think, but I'm not sure--
- It's gone under his seat.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.436
Oh, no. Has it?

24:30.537 --> 24:32.071
It's all right,
I'll get it out later.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.177
JAMES:
Oh, it's done a treat, this.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.879
Look at this, Hammond.

24:42.248 --> 24:44.450
Mm.

24:44.551 --> 24:45.885
Oh, that's all right,
isn't it?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.155
Ooh.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.563
It tastes like fish,
doesn't it?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.832
OK, does anybody want a beer?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.401
- No.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.971
- Oh, you...

25:05.037 --> 25:07.640
- That deserves a stabbing.

25:07.707 --> 25:08.775
That is a proper stabbing.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.109
That's properly out of order.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.181
RICHARD: After lunch,

25:15.247 --> 25:17.850
we set off once more
into the dunes.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.822
Right,
so let's keep heading east.

25:22.889 --> 25:25.825
And we must come to
a road at some...

25:25.892 --> 25:28.628
There has to be a road.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.598
JEREMY: But,
for mile after mile,

25:31.598 --> 25:32.899
there wasn't.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.045
It's the Namib Desert.

25:46.112 --> 25:50.983
"Namib" in the local dialect
means "big nothing".

25:56.155 --> 26:00.259
It must be the prettiest
desert in the world.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.094
It's just a sea of dunes.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.369
JEREMY: Dunes which
were getting bigger.

26:10.436 --> 26:13.973
JAMES: Bloody Nora,
look at the size of that!

26:15.942 --> 26:20.279
Engaging 180 horsepower.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.382
JEREMY: Climbing them in our
two-wheel-drive beach buggies

26:23.449 --> 26:25.084
was becoming tricky.

26:26.986 --> 26:32.191
Come on, you can do this.
You can do this!

26:32.258 --> 26:37.296
But by deploying the V8,
I was sort of all right.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.464
Yes!

26:38.530 --> 26:41.367
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

26:41.433 --> 26:45.571
Hammond had grippy tyres,
so he was all right, too.

26:45.672 --> 26:48.240
Please, make it. Please.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.910
Please!

26:53.045 --> 26:54.380
Ho-ho!

26:54.446 --> 26:55.948
There you go!

26:56.015 --> 26:58.985
However, back in the 1960s...

27:01.754 --> 27:03.990
Come on, little car.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.425
- Oh, no, no, no.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.559
No, no.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.406
- Yes.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.108
Two problems. Number one,

27:22.174 --> 27:24.711
he's put a 90 horsepower
engine in it,

27:24.711 --> 27:26.445
which actually
is probably only 40.

27:26.512 --> 27:27.847
- Yeah.
- And number two,

27:27.914 --> 27:30.717
he will not use
full power ever.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.320
Well, he's got
a 90 horsepower engine,
but a 5 horsepower foot.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.125
And I bet you any money he's
saying "I had a misfire."

27:46.999 --> 27:48.835
You've got to push the
accelerator all the way to--

27:48.901 --> 27:50.136
I know, but... I know that.

27:50.202 --> 27:52.338
It occasionally has
a little misfire moment,

27:52.404 --> 27:53.572
and then I lose it.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.407
- He said it!

27:57.844 --> 28:00.346
JEREMY: And so
the afternoon continued.

28:00.412 --> 28:04.550
The Grunt Machine
and the Grit Machine
would forge ahead...

28:04.616 --> 28:08.454
There is no way in hell
I'm doing this!

28:08.520 --> 28:10.156
Yes!

28:13.659 --> 28:15.561
You star!

28:15.627 --> 28:16.929
...and then there'd be

28:16.996 --> 28:19.799
the inevitable
radio exchange.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.834
We appear to be a man down,
Jeremy.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.403
JEREMY:
James May, where are you?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.410
JEREMY: Because
we spent so much time

28:31.477 --> 28:34.046
waiting
for Captain Misfire,

28:34.113 --> 28:37.216
we were still in the desert
as dusk fell.

28:37.283 --> 28:41.320
And failing light meant it
was hard to spot obstacles.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.623
Right, sit rep.

28:44.690 --> 28:48.027
Jesus  Christ!

28:48.094 --> 28:50.797
- Holy...

28:53.265 --> 28:55.701
- Oh, my God!

28:55.802 --> 28:58.437
- Oh, shit!

28:58.504 --> 29:00.439
RICHARD: Look at it!

29:00.506 --> 29:02.441
Mate, I've got
to have a look.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.214
Oh, shitty death...

29:10.116 --> 29:13.019
- I locked up.
That was just...
- Look, he's buried!

29:13.085 --> 29:16.688
- You've buried the front.
- I was completely locked up.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.257
'Cause I would have
gone down that.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.826
- Look at it!

29:22.428 --> 29:25.364
My close shave was a reminder
that, after dark,

29:25.431 --> 29:29.168
these dunes would become
very, very dangerous.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.643
RICHARD: It's getting
harder and harder
to read the terrain now.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.278
Is that a drop?
Is that a hill?

29:39.345 --> 29:41.848
Is that going up?
Is that a cliff?
What is it?

29:43.983 --> 29:46.018
Peril... peril.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.988
Oh, shit!

29:49.055 --> 29:50.957
Oh, I think there's
a drop off there.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.759
It's just a black abyss.

29:53.860 --> 29:57.096
That could be
a huge cliff again.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.268
RICHARD: Eventually,
we could take no more,

30:02.334 --> 30:07.273
and we had to settle down
for a second night
around our engines.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.699
We will find a road.
There must...

30:33.765 --> 30:36.502
- It can't... It can't
go on forever, can it?
- No.

30:36.568 --> 30:40.472
It has to... There will be
a town, a road... something.

30:42.942 --> 30:46.112
RICHARD: Unfortunately,
to find salvation,

30:46.178 --> 30:50.249
we still had to climb
more dunes.

30:50.316 --> 30:53.953
Climb them and then
get down the other side.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.421
Oh, my God!

30:57.656 --> 30:59.191
Well, that's just a cliff!

31:01.060 --> 31:03.329
Whoa! Aargh!

31:10.002 --> 31:13.105
Whoa, this is a monster.

31:13.172 --> 31:16.675
Oh!
I don't think I can do...!

31:16.742 --> 31:19.378
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

31:24.450 --> 31:28.087
Whoa-a-a-a-a-a!

31:31.057 --> 31:32.324
Here we go.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.127
All three of us
simultaneously...

31:38.965 --> 31:40.399
Holy shit.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.069
Oh-h-h-h, shit!

31:43.135 --> 31:46.438
Argh-hhh! Ha-ha!

31:46.505 --> 31:49.408
Whoa-a-a-a-a!

31:51.010 --> 31:52.344
I wasn't scared.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.217
Oh, my God.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.687
Guys, this is the biggest yet
by a country mile.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.993
Whoa-a-a-a-a-a!

32:06.993 --> 32:08.460
Is that the size of the drop

32:08.527 --> 32:10.396
or what's happened
to his penis?

32:13.332 --> 32:15.601
Right, then. Let's see
what all the fuss is about.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.636
Holy shit!

32:21.073 --> 32:26.012
Oh-h-h-h-h!

32:28.880 --> 32:30.249
Phwoar.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.018
And now straighten
those wheels, Richard,

32:32.051 --> 32:33.385
straighten them,

32:33.452 --> 32:35.021
because you've got to
go down straight.

32:35.087 --> 32:39.158
Holy shit.
Oh-h-h-h-h, shit!

32:39.225 --> 32:41.027
That is frightening.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.834
Love this desert.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.902
I'm never, ever, ever happier

32:51.037 --> 32:53.405
than I am
when I'm in a desert.

32:53.472 --> 32:57.609
And this... this is the best
desert I've ever been to.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.348
You can never really lose
sight of the fact, though,

33:02.414 --> 33:04.050
that what it actually is

33:04.116 --> 33:08.487
is a big, orange
killing engine.

33:08.554 --> 33:12.091
Now, a big crest's coming up.
No idea.

33:12.158 --> 33:15.761
Gentle rolling hill
or massive cliff?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.663
I don't know, Hammond!

33:17.729 --> 33:19.931
Hammond, seriously.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.833
Shit, he's gone.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.370
Hammond's gone, everyone.
Hammond's gone. Big one.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.076
Oh,  me.

33:36.815 --> 33:40.286
How the
did you get down that?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.090
With my eyes shut!

33:44.123 --> 33:46.492
That was terrifying!

33:48.794 --> 33:51.097
Jesus!

33:59.205 --> 34:01.140
JEREMY: As we
continued to head east,

34:01.207 --> 34:03.509
the terrain
eventually levelled out...

34:07.679 --> 34:11.750
which meant
we swapped terror
for extreme discomfort.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.789
Ah. Oh, God Almighty.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.792
I don't think these cars
were actually designed

34:20.859 --> 34:23.495
to take this much punishment.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.132
- And I know we weren't.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.833
The only thing is,

34:27.899 --> 34:31.603
James's car rides lower
than this and will be worse.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.606
Argh! Ow!

34:34.673 --> 34:36.408
Ow! Ow! Ow!

34:38.144 --> 34:40.312
Agh!

34:40.379 --> 34:42.414
JEREMY: Soon,
the relentless battering

34:42.481 --> 34:45.151
started to cause breakdowns.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.921
Sand... Sand in gear shift.

34:49.988 --> 34:52.858
JEREMY: My throttle is
jammed wide open, people.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.438
The problem is that every
time the air filter, here,

35:06.505 --> 35:09.040
turns as I'm driving along--
which it does--

35:09.175 --> 35:11.177
it's jamming the throttle.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.182
What's going on here?

35:17.783 --> 35:19.084
What's up?

35:19.185 --> 35:21.086
The throttle is now jamming

35:21.187 --> 35:22.688
fully open all the time.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.656
Oh, problem.

35:42.674 --> 35:43.775
Oh, God.

35:45.211 --> 35:49.448
It is still moving.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.550
RICHARD: Many miles ahead,

35:51.617 --> 35:54.653
we'd pulled over for a break
from the endless bumps,

35:54.720 --> 35:57.689
and James was being
very interesting!

36:01.059 --> 36:04.062
The good thing about this hat
is you can angle it,
like a heliostat,

36:04.129 --> 36:05.431
to where
the sun's coming from.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.032
Yes, that's true.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.735
But you still look a tit.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.904
Luckily for Hammond, who
could do with the company,

36:12.971 --> 36:15.641
I was back on the move.

36:15.707 --> 36:19.978
Right, a new style of driving
is now required.

36:20.045 --> 36:24.082
This arm for steering,
this arm for changing gear,

36:24.149 --> 36:29.020
and then another arm
for deaccelerating, like so.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.022
Yes!

36:31.089 --> 36:32.724
Accelerate.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.528
Deaccelerate.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.997
Sometimes, if you
listen very carefully,

36:39.064 --> 36:40.832
you can hear my genius.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.070
JEREMY: Back as a threesome,
we continued

36:45.136 --> 36:49.541
with our seemingly
endless journey to the east.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.744
Just need to find a road now.
This is not funny any more.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.347
Enough desert.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.449
I don't want another night
in the desert.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.620
I smell pretty bad.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.389
And I suspect that
if we manage

37:03.455 --> 37:06.325
to find somewhere tonight
near civilisation,

37:06.392 --> 37:08.294
we should probably
have a ceremonial

37:08.360 --> 37:11.196
bonfire of the underpants.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.664
JAMES: In truth, though,

37:12.731 --> 37:15.767
I thought we'd be
in the desert forever.

37:15.834 --> 37:19.971
But then,
late in the afternoon...

37:20.038 --> 37:25.577
I'm looking ahead,
and I'm not seeing
an endless sea of sand.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.414
I'm seeing green.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.718
Trees!
Those are trees and shrubs!

37:37.623 --> 37:38.690
Pylons!

37:38.757 --> 37:41.327
Pylons!
That means electricity.

37:45.631 --> 37:46.798
Oh, yes!

37:47.966 --> 37:49.501
Civilisation!

37:51.403 --> 37:54.005
JAMES:
And then, best of all...

37:55.774 --> 37:56.942
Oh, my God.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.919
I honestly thought we had
another night of sleeping...

38:07.986 --> 38:09.555
- ...in the sand.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.957
But, no! Look at it!

38:13.759 --> 38:15.761
Nicest thing I've ever seen.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.800
JEREMY: I could go east,
I could go west...

38:21.867 --> 38:24.202
Whichever way you go, it goes
somewhere. That's the point.

38:24.269 --> 38:26.037
It's a road,
it goes somewhere.

38:26.104 --> 38:29.240
You know what we've
just done, don't you?

38:29.375 --> 38:32.744
We've just crossed
the Namib Desert
in three beach buggies.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.145
- We have.
- We did.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.014
We did.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.950
There is literally nothing
can stop us now.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.756
JEREMY: Admittedly,

38:44.823 --> 38:48.059
our crossing had not exactly
been as the crow flies,

38:48.126 --> 38:49.828
but we had found our road,

38:49.895 --> 38:52.063
and that's all that mattered.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.533
Oh, yes!

38:54.600 --> 38:56.668
That's the best thing
I've ever seen!

38:56.735 --> 39:00.406
Yes,
it is the road to freedom!

39:05.310 --> 39:09.314
Something has just exploded
at the back of my car.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.617
Oh, dear.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.052
By the time my colleagues
had got back to me,

39:14.119 --> 39:16.922
I'd worked out
what the problem was.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.157
It's really
straightforward, OK?

39:19.224 --> 39:22.661
- The top bolt has come
out of the shock absorber.
- Right.

39:22.728 --> 39:26.264
It shot up, boinged
into the coolant pipe,

39:26.331 --> 39:29.668
and three gallons of water
have simply burst out,

39:29.735 --> 39:32.471
going everywhere
except into the engine.

39:32.538 --> 39:36.274
- Right.
- So all I've got to do
is reattach the top bolt...

39:36.341 --> 39:40.846
mend the pipe and find
three gallons of water...

39:40.912 --> 39:45.250
which I shall get
from a passing motorist,
and I'll be on my way.

39:45.316 --> 39:46.351
Right.

39:46.452 --> 39:47.586
All I could do
with a hand with

39:47.653 --> 39:49.154
is just lifting the car up

39:49.220 --> 39:51.289
so I can reattach the, um...

39:51.356 --> 39:53.224
Yeah. Well,
is there anybody here?

39:53.291 --> 39:55.894
- There's...
- I suppose a motorist
will pass eventually.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.630
The one that gives you water
will also lift it up for you.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.466
You could just
lift it up a little bit.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.400
Or we could go
and have a beer.

40:02.400 --> 40:02.468
Or we could go
and have a beer.
- I hear traffic.
- Yes.
- We'd better not be here.

40:02.468 --> 40:04.335
- I hear traffic.
- Yes.
- We'd better not be here.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.438
We don't want to interfere
when you're trying to talk

40:06.505 --> 40:08.006
'cause we might put them off.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.613
Right.

40:25.524 --> 40:29.795
Somewhere along here
there will be a place,

40:29.861 --> 40:32.964
and that place
will have a bar in it

40:33.031 --> 40:34.566
that will contain beer.

40:39.237 --> 40:40.506
Do you have any water?

40:40.572 --> 40:41.940
- Water.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.242
Because the radiator
has blown,

40:44.309 --> 40:45.911
so I need just three gallons.

40:45.977 --> 40:49.214
Look, you've got some water
there. Just a bucket.

40:52.751 --> 40:55.621
It's an actual water lorry...

40:55.687 --> 40:58.490
leaking water,
and he won't give me any.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.230
Eventually,
I flagged down a local

41:05.296 --> 41:07.533
who had water to spare.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.568
Thank you.

41:09.635 --> 41:12.003
And then I got on
with the repairs.

41:12.070 --> 41:16.642
That is one reassembled
shock absorber.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.143
That's reattached,

41:18.209 --> 41:20.879
so that's the cooling system
back in one piece.

41:25.116 --> 41:28.754
JAMES: After an exhausting
five-hour drive,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.322
Richard and I finally
reached a town,

41:31.389 --> 41:35.761
which turned out to be
Namibia's capital city:
Windhoek,

41:35.827 --> 41:38.830
and we too were
taking on liquids.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.715
Mm.

42:04.055 --> 42:06.424
Back out on
the highway, though,

42:06.491 --> 42:09.194
things weren't so good.

42:09.260 --> 42:13.799
What I'm driving here -
or attempting to drive -
is Apollo 13.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.366
There's some air
trapped in the system

42:15.433 --> 42:18.604
and I've had to make
a small hole in the front

42:18.670 --> 42:20.205
to get at the radiator.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.607
Bled that,

42:21.607 --> 42:23.341
bled all the stuff
going into the engine.

42:23.408 --> 42:24.509
This is the header pipe.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.311
Everything is bled, and yet,

42:26.377 --> 42:28.814
you do a mile, it overheats.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.616
Another mile, overheats.

42:42.060 --> 42:46.331
Well, we've covered...
20 miles in four hours.

43:01.246 --> 43:06.384
This is the sixth time
in 30 miles that's happened.

43:06.451 --> 43:09.387
Whilst my colleagues
embraced beer and bed,

43:09.454 --> 43:13.124
I steeled myself
for the longest, coldest,

43:13.191 --> 43:17.062
most frustrating night
of my life.

43:22.668 --> 43:24.169
JEREMY:
The roads are getting worse.

43:24.235 --> 43:26.672
Honestly, my bones
are going to shatter.

43:26.705 --> 43:29.741
- Oh, my God!

43:34.980 --> 43:38.784
- I've had a great idea.
- Oh, no.

43:39.785 --> 43:41.820
Oh, shit, it's really high!
