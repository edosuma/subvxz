WEBVTT

00:05.421 --> 00:08.573
OH. COME ON,
GET IN THERE.

00:08.640 --> 00:09.574
UHH!

00:09.641 --> 00:11.743
A LITTLE SHORT.

00:11.810 --> 00:13.828
AW! NOTHING BUT POCKET.

00:13.896 --> 00:16.097
ON TOP OF THE KEY.
FADE AWAY.

00:20.002 --> 00:21.503
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:21.571 --> 00:24.706
JUST PLAYING
A LITTLE SPOONERBALL.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.174
IN THE POCKET
IS ONE POINT,

00:26.241 --> 00:28.109
BETWEEN THE GLASSES
AND FACE-2 POINTS,

00:28.177 --> 00:31.979
AND IN THE MOUTH,
THAT'S YOUR 3-POINTER.

00:32.046 --> 00:35.316
AND CHOKING HIM TO DEATH,
HOW DOES THAT FACTOR IN?

00:35.384 --> 00:37.953
10-POINT BONUS.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.888
COME ON. GIVE IT A SHOT.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.006
NO. I'M NOT GONNA
THROW FOOD AT MY FATHER.

00:42.074 --> 00:43.875
WHAT ABOUT THAT CHICKEN LEG
LAST WEEK?

00:43.943 --> 00:44.793
AH, EXCUSE ME,

00:44.861 --> 00:47.512
HE THREW PEAS
AT ME FIRST.

00:47.579 --> 00:49.296
COME ON.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

00:49.364 --> 00:50.749
OK, MAYBE JUST ONE.

00:50.817 --> 00:51.800
OK.

00:53.936 --> 00:55.303
OK, ONE MORE.

00:55.371 --> 00:57.421
ONE MORE.
ALL RIGHT.

00:57.489 --> 00:59.874
AHH. NO. YOU GOTTA-
YOU GOTTA ARC IT.

00:59.942 --> 01:02.043
KEEP YOUR ELBOWS IN,
LIKE THAT, JUST ARC IT.

01:02.110 --> 01:03.144
THERE YA GO.

01:03.211 --> 01:04.394
COME ON. OPEN UP,
LIKE THAT.

01:05.431 --> 01:07.132
ALMOST.
OK, OK.

01:07.199 --> 01:08.199
OK.
OH!

01:08.267 --> 01:09.283
COME ON.

01:17.393 --> 01:20.095
SO I WASN'T DREAMING.

01:20.162 --> 01:21.212
MARVELOUS.

01:22.815 --> 01:24.499
WAIT A SECOND.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.668
WHERE ARE THE DUTCH HOOKERS?

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.293 --> 02:09.644
VOILÃ€.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.315
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
WE WERE HAVING CAKE.

02:14.382 --> 02:16.484
YEAH. I DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT
CAKE EARLY IN THE DAY ANYMORE.

02:16.552 --> 02:18.186
IT PARALYZES YOU.

02:18.254 --> 02:19.637
DOES NOT.
OH, COME ON.

02:19.705 --> 02:23.608
REMEMBER LAST TIME YOU WERE SO
DISTRACTED YOU REAR-ENDED A SCHOOL BUS?

02:23.643 --> 02:27.378
OK, THAT WAS PIE,
SO DON'T REWRITE HISTORY.

02:29.665 --> 02:31.333
AHH! THIS MILK
COULDN'T BE WARMER.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.767
YEAH. THE FRIDGE
IS ACTING UP AGAIN.

02:32.835 --> 02:34.302
THAT'S AS COLD
AS IT'S GONNA GET.

02:35.621 --> 02:37.255
HEY! COME ON, MAN!

02:37.322 --> 02:39.457
I WANT TO SEE
IF IT'S COLD.

02:39.525 --> 02:41.693
SHE JUST POURED IT OUT
OF THE SAME CARTON.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.428
THE MILK ON THE BOTTOM
IS COLDER.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.562
NO, IT'S NOT.

02:44.630 --> 02:46.731
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN LOCKED OVERNIGHT

02:46.799 --> 02:48.933
IN A DAIRY
STORAGE FACILITY!

02:49.001 --> 02:51.703
DAD, WILL YOU STOP? I
HAVEN'T WORKED FOR 2 MONTHS,

02:51.770 --> 02:53.538
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE AN EXTRA
THOUSAND BUCKS LAYING AROUND

02:53.606 --> 02:56.006
TO BUY US A NEW REFRIGERATOR,
PLEASE, JUST DRINK IT.

03:01.630 --> 03:04.331
ALL RIGHT, IT'S DOWN.

03:04.399 --> 03:06.667
FOR NOW.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.071
KNOCK KNOCK.
HEY, HOLLY.

03:10.139 --> 03:12.240
HEY! HEY, ARTHUR,
YOU READY FOR BINGO?

03:12.307 --> 03:15.844
INDEED I AM.
WHAT'S WITH THE KRAUT?

03:15.911 --> 03:17.746
THIS IS MY NEW DOG SHATZI.

03:17.813 --> 03:19.914
HE RETIRED FROM THE POLICE
FORCE, AND I ADOPTED HIM.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.249
POLICE DOG, HUH?

03:21.316 --> 03:23.151
BEFORE HE STARTS BARKING,
I SHOULD TELL YOU

03:23.218 --> 03:27.355
I HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF
CONTRABAND IN MY SOCK DRAWER.

03:27.422 --> 03:30.908
OH, DON'T WORRY, ARTHUR.
HE'S A BOMB-SNIFFING DOG.

03:30.976 --> 03:34.646
HE'S A REAL HERO, TOO. I MET HIM
WHEN THEY BUSTED MY BOYFRIEND.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.250
SO YOUR BOYFRIEND
WAS MAKING A BOMB?

03:38.317 --> 03:41.620
SOON-TO-BE EX-BOYFRIEND,
BELIEVE YOU ME.

03:41.687 --> 03:43.421
OK, ARTHUR,
ARE YOU READY?

03:43.489 --> 03:45.590
ALL SET.
SEE YOU KIDS LATER.

03:45.658 --> 03:46.591
OH, CUTE HAT.

03:46.659 --> 03:47.592
THANK YOU.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.761
I FOUND IT
IN A LEAF PILE.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.331
ENH!

03:53.399 --> 03:55.716
OH, THIS MILK IS WARM.
YOU THINK IT'S DANGEROUS?

03:55.784 --> 03:57.636
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, BUT
YOUR DAD HAD HIS FINGER IN IT,

03:57.703 --> 04:00.405
AND IT'S THE ONE HE
WORKS HIS EAR WITH, SO...

04:15.454 --> 04:17.238
HE'S IN MY DREAMS.

04:19.491 --> 04:21.358
HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?

04:21.427 --> 04:22.744
BIG NEWS.

04:22.811 --> 04:25.730
I WAS SITTING NEXT TO ELEANOR
MELVILLE AT BINGO TONIGHT.

04:25.798 --> 04:29.283
SHE'S THE LADY WHO LOST AN EYE
IN A SLEDDING ACCIDENT, REMEMBER?

04:29.351 --> 04:31.486
ALL RIGHT, HE'S GOIN'
IN THE HAMPER.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.154
DAD, IT'S KINDA LATE.

04:33.222 --> 04:35.223
COULD YOU JUST
GET TO THE POINT?

04:35.291 --> 04:37.358
GOD BLESS
HER LUCKY GLASS EYE

04:37.426 --> 04:40.044
BECAUSE TONIGHT
I WON THE JACKPOT!

04:40.112 --> 04:42.897
GREAT. TAKE YOUR 8 BUCKS
AND GET OUTTA HERE.

04:42.965 --> 04:45.566
DOES THIS LOOK
LIKE 8 BUCKS TO YOU?

04:45.768 --> 04:47.234
WOW, HOW MUCH IS THAT?

04:47.302 --> 04:50.371
2,500 CLAMS.

04:50.438 --> 04:53.558
$2,500? OH, MY GOD!

04:53.626 --> 04:55.943
AT FIRST I THOUGHT I'D PUT
IT AWAY FOR A RAINY DAY,

04:56.011 --> 04:58.913
BUT THEN I REALIZED, I GOT
NO MORTGAGE, NO BILLS TO PAY,

04:58.981 --> 05:01.916
SO I FIGURED IT'S TIME FOR A.
SPOONER TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

05:01.984 --> 05:04.385
STARTING TOMORROW,
I'M QUEEN FOR A DAY!

05:07.356 --> 05:09.624
WELL... GOOD FOR HIM.

05:15.664 --> 05:17.131
WHAT?

05:17.198 --> 05:21.068
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?

05:21.136 --> 05:24.288
OTHER THAN HIS FLY
BEING OPEN?

05:24.356 --> 05:28.375
NO. I'M NUMB
TO THAT NOW.

05:28.443 --> 05:30.378
I MEAN THE FACT
THAT HE DIDN'T MENTION

05:30.446 --> 05:32.780
GIVING US ANY
OF THAT MONEY.

05:32.848 --> 05:34.982
WHY SHOULD HE?
IT'S HIS MONEY.

05:35.050 --> 05:36.701
ARE YOU KIDDING ME,
CARRIE?

05:36.769 --> 05:38.670
I MEAN, WE SPEND THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS ON HIM.

05:38.738 --> 05:39.871
HE SAID IT HIMSELF.

05:39.938 --> 05:42.006
HE'S GOT NO BILLS,
NO MORTGAGE TO PAY

05:42.074 --> 05:42.990
<i>BECAUSE WE PAY IT,</i>

05:43.058 --> 05:45.410
NOT TO MENTION ALL
THE FOOD, CLOTHING,

05:45.444 --> 05:47.445
MEDICINE,
THOSE 2 CLARINETS.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.733
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
WHEN A PARENT GETS OLD.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.170
I MEAN, HE DID TAKE CARE OF ME
UNTIL I WAS ALMOST... 15.

05:55.237 --> 05:57.338
AND, MEANWHILE,
SINCE YOU LOST YOUR JOB,

05:57.406 --> 05:59.940
WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN ONE
THING FOR OURSELVES, NOT ONE!

06:00.008 --> 06:02.393
DO YOU KNOW EVERY NIGHT
BEFORE I GO TO BED,

06:02.461 --> 06:04.395
I LOOK AT
THIS GOLF CATALOG,

06:04.463 --> 06:06.030
BUT I CAN'T GET
ANYTHING IN HERE.

06:06.097 --> 06:08.999
SO THIS MEANS NOTHING
TO ME!

06:10.803 --> 06:13.054
THE POINT IS, I WANT A
TITANIUM FAIRWAY WOOD,

06:13.121 --> 06:14.455
AND I WANT IT NOW!

06:14.522 --> 06:16.790
AND DAMN IT, YOU DESERVE
SOMETHING, TOO. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

06:16.859 --> 06:19.827
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BUY
IS A NEW REFRIGERATOR.

06:19.895 --> 06:21.329
OK, SO I'LL
GET THE GOLF CLUBS,

06:21.396 --> 06:23.481
AND THE FRIDGE
WILL BE YOUR THING.

06:23.548 --> 06:26.167
NO. WHY DO I
GET THE BORING THING?

06:26.234 --> 06:27.585
FINE. THEN PICK SOMETHING
YOU WANT.

06:27.652 --> 06:29.753
I MEAN, THE OLD FRIDGE
IS FINE.

06:29.821 --> 06:32.840
RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T NEED
SOMETHING TO KEEP FOOD FRESH,

06:32.908 --> 06:36.494
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO KEEP US FRESH.

06:36.561 --> 06:39.280
ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D LOVE?

06:39.348 --> 06:41.916
I'D LOVE TO GO TO THAT SPA
RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO BLOOMINGDALE'S

06:41.984 --> 06:44.018
AND GET, LIKE,
A WHOLE DAY OF BEAUTY.

06:44.086 --> 06:47.188
YES! GOD, YOU NEED
A DAY OF BEAUTY!

06:47.256 --> 06:49.157
HEY.

06:49.225 --> 06:52.192
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, OK?

06:52.227 --> 06:53.944
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:54.012 --> 06:58.215
TOMORROW MORNING, I WILL TALK TO
HIM. I WILL TELL HIM HOW WE FEEL,

06:58.283 --> 06:59.767
AND I'M SURE HE'LL
GIVE US SOME OF THE MONEY.

06:59.835 --> 07:02.803
GREAT. ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU.

07:02.872 --> 07:04.438
AND IF THAT DOESN'T
WORK, I'LL JUST FOLLOW UP

07:04.506 --> 07:07.124
WITH A LAMP
TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

07:07.192 --> 07:10.144
NOT TO KILL HIM,
JUST TO SEND A MESSAGE.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.213
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

07:21.874 --> 07:23.440
MORNING, DADDY.

07:23.508 --> 07:26.144
DARLING, I THINK I'M READY
TO MAKE MY FIRST PURCHASE:

07:26.211 --> 07:30.548
THE WORLD'S BEST
PERSONAL SUBMARINE.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.249
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:32.317 --> 07:36.670
WORLD'S BEST?
WITH NO PERISCOPE?

07:36.738 --> 07:38.806
YOU'RE SMARTER THAN THAT.

07:38.874 --> 07:41.008
SPEAKING OF THAT MONEY,

07:41.076 --> 07:43.511
IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE
SOMEONE IN THIS HOUSE

07:43.579 --> 07:45.446
HAVE SOME GOOD LUCK
FOR A CHANGE.

07:45.514 --> 07:46.847
IT CERTAINLY IS.

07:46.915 --> 07:49.049
LORD KNOWS DOUG AND I
HAVEN'T HAD ANY LATELY.

07:49.117 --> 07:50.217
THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY.

07:50.285 --> 07:52.937
THE THING IS, UM...

07:53.005 --> 07:56.874
WE HAVE CERTAINLY HELPED YOU
OUT QUITE A BIT OVER THE YEARS.

07:56.942 --> 07:58.859
HOW SO?

08:00.278 --> 08:04.315
WELL, WE'VE GIVEN YOU FOOD,
CLOTHING, SHELTER.

08:04.382 --> 08:07.702
MM. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD
PUT THAT SPIN ON IT.

08:07.770 --> 08:11.406
AND WE WERE KIND OF HOPING

08:11.473 --> 08:15.492
THAT YOU COULD HELP US OUT A
LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW, MONEY-WISE.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.529
OH, I'D LOVE TO
BE ABLE TO HELP.

08:17.596 --> 08:20.080
YOU KIDS HAVE BEEN
LIKE FAMILY TO ME.

08:20.148 --> 08:22.567
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:22.634 --> 08:23.551
HALF.

08:23.618 --> 08:26.554
I MEANT, WHAT SPECIFIC ITEMS
DO YOU WANT TO PURCHASE?

08:26.621 --> 08:28.956
I WANT GOLF CLUBS. SHE
WANTS A DAY OF BEAUTY.

08:29.024 --> 08:32.326
FAIR ENOUGH. I'LL GIVE
YOUR REQUESTS SOME THOUGHT

08:32.393 --> 08:34.544
AND GET BACK TO YOU
IN A DAY OR SO.

08:35.864 --> 08:38.716
BUT JUST TO SHOW MY HEART'S
IN THE RIGHT PLACE,

08:38.784 --> 08:42.886
HOW 'BOUT WE PAINT THE TOWN
RED TONIGHT, MY TREAT?

08:42.955 --> 08:45.456
OH, WE HAVE PLANS
TONIGHT, DAD.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.707
DO YOU?

08:46.774 --> 08:51.145
THAT'S
VERY DISAPPOINTING.

08:51.213 --> 08:54.865
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE CAN CANCEL. NO PROBLEM.

08:54.933 --> 08:56.867
WONDERFUL. I'LL
PICK YOU UP AT 5:30.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.003
DRESS IS SMART CASUAL.

09:46.668 --> 09:48.102
DON'T OVERTHINK IT, DAD.

09:48.169 --> 09:51.272
THAT'S WHAT GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE
BACK AT THE CLOWN'S MOUTH.

09:56.094 --> 09:58.646
THAT ONE WAS CLOSE.

10:03.985 --> 10:06.587
THAT ONE
WAS CLOSE, TOO.

10:06.655 --> 10:09.907
BE A PAL.
SHOVE THIS IN MY EYE.

10:09.975 --> 10:11.508
OK... NOW!

10:14.546 --> 10:15.713
NOW!

10:18.150 --> 10:21.118
THOSE BLADES ARE DIABOLICAL.

10:21.186 --> 10:24.221
NOW. NOW. NOW. NOW!

10:25.090 --> 10:27.591
OH... WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

10:29.561 --> 10:30.561
NOW.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.916
THANK GOD.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.856
LAST NIGHT WAS SO BRUTAL.

10:41.924 --> 10:44.158
SO WHEN DO WE
GET THIS MONEY?

10:44.225 --> 10:45.343
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I SHOULD WARN YOU:

10:45.411 --> 10:46.844
HE TOLD ME TO
KEEP SATURDAY OPEN

10:46.912 --> 10:49.614
FOR A TRIP TO
THE AMERICAN DOLL MUSEUM.

10:50.766 --> 10:52.567
FAMILY MEETING!

10:52.634 --> 10:53.234
WHAT?

10:53.302 --> 10:54.685
CALLING A FAMILY MEETING.

10:54.753 --> 10:57.154
GRAB YOUR DRINKS AND KINDLY
FOLLOW ME TO THE DINING ROOM.

10:57.222 --> 10:58.288
CHOP CHOP.

11:00.191 --> 11:01.659
COME ON.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.219
<i>PLEASE RISE FOR
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.</i>

11:12.287 --> 11:16.073
IF YOU CHOOSE, YOU MAY
OMIT THE WORDS, "UNDER GOD."

11:16.140 --> 11:18.326
GET ON WITH IT.

11:18.393 --> 11:19.726
FINE.

11:19.794 --> 11:21.728
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS,

11:21.796 --> 11:24.548
VIS-Ã€-VIS, THE ITEMS
YOU REQUESTED YESTERDAY,

11:24.616 --> 11:26.717
UNFORTUNATELY, NO CAN DO.

11:28.754 --> 11:29.554
WHAT?

11:29.704 --> 11:31.672
DAD, YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO HELP US OUT.

11:31.740 --> 11:35.125
I DO. I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU $1,000

11:35.193 --> 11:38.128
TO PURCHASE A NEW REFRIGERATOR.

11:38.196 --> 11:40.815
YOU KNOW,
I GOT A BETTER IDEA:

11:40.883 --> 11:42.466
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE US $1,000,

11:42.534 --> 11:44.985
AND WE'LL DECIDE WHAT WE
WANT TO DO WITH IT, OK?

11:45.053 --> 11:47.588
OH, TO BE YOUNG AND WITLESS.

11:47.656 --> 11:50.525
DOUGLAS, TRUST ME,
YOU DON'T GET TO MY POSITION

11:50.592 --> 11:53.160
BY THROWING AWAY MONEY
ON FRIVOLOUS THINGS.

11:53.228 --> 11:55.229
YOU WANTED TO
BUY A SUBMARINE.

11:55.296 --> 11:58.349
HEY! WHEN THE ONLY WAY OUT OF
THE CITY IS THROUGH THE SEWERS,

11:58.416 --> 12:00.885
YOU'LL BE BEGGING TO GET IN.

12:11.829 --> 12:15.299
<i>I HATE THIS.</i>

12:15.367 --> 12:17.101
WHAT? IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE GETTING NOTHING.

12:17.169 --> 12:20.470
I MEAN, THE MAN IS BUYING US
A NEW REFRIGERATOR.

12:20.538 --> 12:21.805
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
JUST 'CAUSE HE

12:21.873 --> 12:24.275
STUMBLED ONTO SOME MONEY
LIKE JED CLAMPETT,

12:24.343 --> 12:26.377
DOESN'T GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO TELL US WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

12:26.445 --> 12:27.678
THIS ONE LOOKS NICE.

12:27.745 --> 12:30.381
OH, AND LOOK HOW BIG
THE CRISPERS ARE.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.782
OH...

12:31.850 --> 12:33.784
HEY, DON'T
KNOCK CRISPERS.

12:33.852 --> 12:37.321
THAT'S WHERE I HIDE THE
VEGETABLES SO THEY WON'T UPSET YOU.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.138
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:38.206 --> 12:39.589
LET'S JUST GET IT
AND GET OUTTA HERE.

12:39.657 --> 12:41.809
OH, LOOK! LOOK
IT'S ONLY 995.

12:41.877 --> 12:44.011
WE CAN TELL MY DAD IT
COST THE FULL THOUSAND,

12:44.079 --> 12:48.549
AND THEN WE GOT 5
BUCKS LEFT TO PAR-TAY.

12:48.617 --> 12:49.550
HMM.

12:49.618 --> 12:50.685
WHAT?

12:51.819 --> 12:53.487
LOOK, I REALLY
DON'T FEEL RIGHT

12:53.555 --> 12:55.589
ABOUT LYING
TO MY DAD.

12:55.657 --> 12:57.090
LOOK, WE
ARE NOT LYING, OK?

12:57.158 --> 13:00.177
WE TOLD HIM WE WERE GOING TO
BUY A REFRIGERATOR, AND WE DID.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.647
THE FACT THAT WE BOUGHT IT FROM A QUEENS
COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WAS MOVING OUT OF HIS DORM,

13:02.714 --> 13:05.432
THAT'S OUR BUSINESS.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.970
DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA
BELIEVE THAT THIS COST $1,000?

13:09.037 --> 13:13.340
CARRIE, THE MAN THINKS I
CONTROL THE TV WITH MY VOICE.

13:13.408 --> 13:15.142
EVERYBODY WINS THIS WAY,
ALL RIGHT?

13:15.209 --> 13:16.343
YOUR DAD FEELS
LIKE A BIG SHOT,

13:16.411 --> 13:18.729
WE GET A TEMPORARY FRIDGE
FOR 68 BUCKS,

13:18.796 --> 13:23.383
AND WITH THE LEFTOVER CHANGE, NEW GOLF
CLUBS AND A DAY AT THE SPA FOR YOU.

13:23.451 --> 13:28.022
OH, LOOK AT THIS.
KENNY'S MOM MADE MEAT LOAF.

13:28.089 --> 13:29.173
MINE NOW.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.228
HEY, DAD.
HOW WAS YOUR WALK?

13:34.295 --> 13:38.532
NOT SO GOOD. TURNS OUT THE DOUBLE-DUTCH
KIDS DON'T APPRECIATE HECKLING.

13:38.599 --> 13:42.803
IS THIS THE NEW
REFRIGERATOR?

13:42.871 --> 13:44.705
YEAH.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.976
IT'S MAGNIFICENT!

13:50.044 --> 13:53.414
AMAZING HOW SMALL THEY
CAN MAKE THINGS THESE DAYS.

13:53.481 --> 13:56.183
GOD BLESS THOSE JAPANESE.

14:02.024 --> 14:03.974
THAT WAS GREAT TODAY.

14:04.042 --> 14:07.044
WE WERE HITTIN' 'EM
PRETTY HARD, HUH?

14:07.112 --> 14:11.048
OH, BUT YOU LIKE IT ROUGH,
DON'T YA?

14:11.116 --> 14:12.766
OH, YES, YOU DOO-BE
DOO-BE DOO!

14:12.918 --> 14:15.219
I AM BACK
FROM THE SPA.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.087
HOW DO I LOOK?

14:17.155 --> 14:18.556
FANTASTIC.

14:18.623 --> 14:22.793
SOON AS I'M DONE FONDLING
MY NEW CLUB, YOU'RE NEXT.

14:22.861 --> 14:26.397
MY MASSAGE WAS AMAZING.

14:26.464 --> 14:28.732
I HAD THIS
RUSSIAN GUY-URI.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.869
HE HAD THESE HUGE HANDS, AND
HE FOUND EVERY KNOT IN MY BODY.

14:32.938 --> 14:37.107
NOT A WHOLE LOT
OF YAP YAP, YOU KNOW?

14:37.175 --> 14:39.760
JUST EVERY COUPLE OF
"IS GOOD?

14:39.827 --> 14:41.929
IS GOOD?"

14:41.996 --> 14:43.764
BY THE WAY, THAT'S
ALL YOU NEED TO SAY

14:43.831 --> 14:47.518
WHEN WE'RE,
YOU KNOW, UPSTAIRS.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.938
<i>SO NO MORE
MIGHTY MOUSE THEME?</i>

14:51.005 --> 14:53.024
SO, THOSE THE NEW CLUBS?

14:53.091 --> 14:55.225
YEAH. THEY'RE AWESOME.

14:55.293 --> 14:56.360
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT DRIVER.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.028
IT'S AS BIG
AS A BABY'S HEAD.

14:58.096 --> 15:01.031
YEAH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YOU DESERVE 'EM.

15:01.099 --> 15:02.667
YEAH, UM...

15:02.734 --> 15:04.368
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,
UH...

15:04.436 --> 15:06.704
I GOT THESE
GREAT NEW WOODS,

15:06.772 --> 15:09.740
BUT I STILL HAVE THE
SAME OLD CRAPPY IRONS.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.108
THEY'RE FINE.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.910
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
I MEAN, IT'S-

15:12.977 --> 15:15.546
IT'S LIKE IF YOU
GOT A DAY OF BEAUTY

15:15.614 --> 15:17.715
FOR ONLY HALF
YOUR FACE,

15:17.849 --> 15:20.433
AND THEY LEFT THE OTHER
SIDE LOOKIN' ALL...

15:20.501 --> 15:22.435
TIRED AND YELLOW.

15:22.503 --> 15:24.104
WHAT ARE YOU GETTIN' AT
HERE, DOUG?

15:24.172 --> 15:26.140
JUST MAYBE WE COULD ASK
YOUR DAD FOR SOME MORE MONEY

15:26.207 --> 15:27.941
SO I COULD
COMPLETE MY SET HERE.

15:28.009 --> 15:30.394
WHAT? WE CAN'T
SCAM HIM AGAIN.

15:30.461 --> 15:31.562
IT'S A FEW HUNDRED.
THAT'S NOT EVEN A SCAM.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.564
THAT'S PULLIN' A FAST ONE.

15:33.632 --> 15:37.501
DOUG, BELIEVE ME, DON'T THINK
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT, OK?

15:37.569 --> 15:38.836
THEY SELL THIS THING
AT THE SPA

15:38.904 --> 15:41.772
THAT TURNS YOUR BATHTUB
INTO A WHIRLPOOL.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.340
YOU DON'T THINK
I WOULD KILL FOR THAT?

15:43.408 --> 15:45.643
BUT LYING TO HIM AGAIN
IS JUST WRONG.

15:45.710 --> 15:46.744
WRONG...

15:46.811 --> 15:49.363
OR VERY RIGHT?

15:49.431 --> 15:50.730
WRONG.

16:01.076 --> 16:03.077
GET OUT OF HERE.
I'M NAKED.

16:04.379 --> 16:06.647
WHY IS THAT WATER
BUBBLING?

16:06.714 --> 16:07.915
UM...

16:07.982 --> 16:10.034
IT'S REALLY HOT?

16:12.053 --> 16:14.071
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU!

16:14.139 --> 16:16.122
AFTER YOU GIVE ME THAT WHOLE
SPEECH ON HOW WRONG THIS IS,

16:16.190 --> 16:17.975
<i>YOU GO OUT
AND BUY THIS?!</i>

16:18.043 --> 16:20.177
BUT IT BUBBLES.

16:21.879 --> 16:23.497
HOW COULD YOU?

16:25.349 --> 16:27.367
IT'S JUST THAT YOUR
GOLF CLUBS ARE FOREVER,

16:27.435 --> 16:29.569
AND MY SPA DAY
IS GONE,

16:29.637 --> 16:31.672
SO I FIGURED, IT'S ONLY FAIR, YOU KNOW?

16:31.739 --> 16:33.590
HOW DID YOU GET YOUR DAD
TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY?

16:33.658 --> 16:35.860
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW OUR
CLOCK RADIO'S BEEN BROKEN?

16:35.927 --> 16:37.594
GAVE ME $200
TO GET A NEW ONE.

16:37.662 --> 16:40.497
200? I GOT THAT FREE WHEN I
ORDERED SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.

16:40.565 --> 16:42.833
HEY, I WAS ONLY
SHOOTING FOR 100,

16:42.901 --> 16:45.102
BUT THEN HE STARTED
TALKING ABOUT TRANSISTORS

16:45.170 --> 16:47.004
AND HOW CLEVER
THOSE JAPANESE ARE.

16:47.072 --> 16:48.172
I JUST WENT WITH IT.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.357
AND YOU MADE ME FEEL BAD
ABOUT WANTING MORE?

16:50.424 --> 16:51.792
OH, IT'S ON, BABY.

16:51.859 --> 16:53.026
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:53.195 --> 16:54.945
OH, WE GOT A HOUSE FULL
OF APPLIANCES,

16:55.013 --> 16:56.947
AND ONE'S
ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

17:02.037 --> 17:03.370
OH, YEAH.

17:03.438 --> 17:04.505
ALL RIGHT.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.444
DOUG, NO!
NOT THE DVD PLAYER!

17:10.512 --> 17:15.198
CARRIE, THIS IS A MACHINE THAT USES
LASERS TO PLAY MOVIES FROM SHINY DISKS.

17:15.266 --> 17:17.166
I COULD TELL HIM
IT COST A MILLION DOLLARS.

17:17.234 --> 17:20.637
DOUG, NO!
THIS HAS TO STOP.

17:20.704 --> 17:21.655
WHY SHOULD IT STOP, CARRIE?

17:21.806 --> 17:23.691
WHAT, AM I BEATING YOU
TO THE PUNCH?

17:23.758 --> 17:26.926
WHAT, YOU GOT YOUR EYE ON SOMETHING
THAT'LL MAKE THE TOILET BUBBLE, TOO?

17:26.993 --> 17:27.595
YEAH?

17:27.662 --> 17:29.280
SHH! HOLLY'S HERE.

17:29.347 --> 17:30.547
YEAH,
I'M STILL HERE.

17:30.615 --> 17:31.348
HI.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.966
HEY, HEY.
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

17:33.034 --> 17:36.136
$800? I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

17:36.237 --> 17:37.587
OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.322
WHAT? WHAT?

17:39.390 --> 17:40.674
SHE NEEDS MONEY.

17:40.742 --> 17:43.661
AND WHO DO YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA TRY TO GET IT FROM? MY DAD.

17:43.728 --> 17:45.929
WHAT DO YOU CARE? YOU SAID YOU
WERE DONE GETTING MONEY FROM HIM.

17:45.997 --> 17:48.748
NOT IF SHE'S GONNA
GET IT INSTEAD.

17:48.816 --> 17:51.535
IF SOMEONE
IS GONNA SCAM MY DAD,

17:51.603 --> 17:55.271
IT SHOULD AT LEAST BE
SOMEONE WHO LOVES HIM.

17:55.339 --> 17:57.374
WHAT DOES SHE NEED
THE MONEY FOR ANYWAY?

17:57.442 --> 17:58.825
SHE FINALLY
GOT THAT BILL

17:58.893 --> 18:01.228
FOR THAT BLONDE THEY
PUMPED INTO HER HAIR?

18:01.296 --> 18:03.397
DON'T WORRY. YOUR DAD PROBABLY
WON'T GIVE HER THE MONEY ANYWAY.

18:03.465 --> 18:05.516
OH, HE WILL, THE WAY
SHE KISSES HIS BUTT.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.918
"OH, ARTHUR, YOU LOOK
SO CUTE IN THAT HAT."

18:07.986 --> 18:10.387
YOU SAW HIM. HE LOOKED
LIKE A 90-YEAR-OLD GILLIGAN.

18:14.425 --> 18:19.613
BY THE WAY,
SO DOES THE REAL GILLIGAN.

18:19.680 --> 18:20.481
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:20.548 --> 18:21.899
JUST BREAK
THE FRICKIN' THING.

18:21.966 --> 18:23.400
WE'VE GOTTA GET THAT MONEY.
ALL RIGHT, NOW,

18:23.467 --> 18:26.469
I'M GONNA GET THE MONEY,
AND YOU KEEP HOLLY BUSY, OK?

18:26.537 --> 18:27.604
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
HURRY UP! HURRY UP!

18:27.672 --> 18:29.506
ALL RIGHT.

18:29.574 --> 18:33.911
UH-HUH. OK, WELL, I'LL JUST
TRY TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT

18:33.979 --> 18:35.479
AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.148
THANKS.

18:38.216 --> 18:40.183
HEY, WHAT YOU
GOT THERE...

18:40.251 --> 18:41.519
SWEATER?

18:43.889 --> 18:45.623
SWEATERS ARE GREAT,

18:45.690 --> 18:49.026
BUT, IRONICALLY, THEY DON'T
HANDLE SWEAT THAT WELL.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.283
THEY'RE VERY WARM,
THOUGH.

18:58.519 --> 19:00.320
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:00.388 --> 19:03.223
MY NEW DOG SHATZI
NEEDS AN OPERATION,

19:03.291 --> 19:05.625
AND I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

19:05.693 --> 19:08.728
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

19:08.796 --> 19:11.131
TURNS OUT, ALL THE STRESS
FROM WORKING ON THE BOMB SQUAD

19:11.199 --> 19:12.466
WEAKENED HIS HEART,

19:12.533 --> 19:14.468
AND NOW THERE'S SOME
KIND OF VALVE RIPPING,

19:14.535 --> 19:16.203
AND IF HE DOESN'T
GET THE OPERATION,

19:16.270 --> 19:17.837
HE'S GONNA BE
IN SO MUCH PAIN,

19:17.905 --> 19:19.373
THEY'RE GONNA
PUT HIM DOWN.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.810
WELL, HE HAD A GOOD RUN.
HE...

19:24.012 --> 19:25.545
HAD A FULL LIFE.

19:25.613 --> 19:28.381
HE'S 4.

19:28.449 --> 19:31.518
YEAH, BUT THAT'S 28
IN HUMAN YEARS.

19:31.585 --> 19:33.520
THAT'S WHEN I
STARTED FALLIN' APART.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.657
AND THE SAD THING IS,
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

19:37.725 --> 19:41.061
YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST
THIS SWEET LOVABLE GUY

19:41.129 --> 19:43.931
WHO JUST WANTS TO
KISS YOU AND BE WITH YOU.

19:43.998 --> 19:49.970
I MEAN, HE SPENT HIS
ENTIRE LIFE SAVING PEOPLE.

19:50.038 --> 19:52.605
AND NOW THERE'S NO ONE
THERE TO SAVE HIM.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.077
WE GOTTA GIVE
THE MONEY TO HOLLY.

19:57.145 --> 19:59.129
WHAT?! WHY?!

19:59.196 --> 20:03.200
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T, WE'RE GONNA SPEND
ETERNITY SWIMMING IN A LAKE OF FIRE.

20:06.954 --> 20:08.439
BOTH OF US?

20:08.506 --> 20:10.373
GIVE ME THIS.

20:27.108 --> 20:28.375
HEY... DAD?

20:28.443 --> 20:29.909
WHAT'S UP?

20:29.977 --> 20:31.211
GUESS WHAT.

20:31.279 --> 20:33.447
I WON AT BINGO AGAIN.

20:33.514 --> 20:35.298
REALLY?
HOW MUCH?

20:35.366 --> 20:36.883
11 BUCKS.

20:36.951 --> 20:39.219
FAMILY MEETING. CHOP CHOP.
