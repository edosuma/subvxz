&lrm;Father, there's something
&lrm;I'd like to talk to you about.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.040
&lrm;-Can I have a few minutes?
&lrm;-Yes, of course.

00:36.960 --> 00:37.800
&lrm;Really?

00:37.920 --> 00:40.160
&lrm;Nathalie will let you know
&lrm;as soon as I'm available.

00:41.680 --> 00:42.600
&lrm;It'll be too late then.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.640
&lrm;Shouldn't you be practising the piano?

00:47.760 --> 00:48.800
&lrm;Yes.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.160
&lrm;That's impossible!

01:22.920 --> 01:24.800
&lrm;Nathalie!

01:25.320 --> 01:27.400
&lrm;Where is my son?

01:27.760 --> 01:31.120
&lrm;Adrien has left his room
&lrm;without either of you noticing?

01:31.240 --> 01:32.840
&lrm;Find him!

01:36.200 --> 01:40.600
&lrm;<i>Radiant... Carefree... Dreamy...</i>

01:40.920 --> 01:44.000
&lrm;<i>Adrien, the fragrance!</i>

01:45.000 --> 01:48.400
&lrm;<i>Adrien...</i>

01:50.760 --> 01:52.200
&lrm;<i>-Adrien...</i>
&lrm;-Adrien...

02:02.520 --> 02:07.280
&lrm;Adrien? The Adrien Agreste?
&lrm;This is awesome!

02:07.880 --> 02:09.600
&lrm;[awkward laugh] OK, bye!

02:09.720 --> 02:10.880
&lrm;When I saw you in that ad,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.440
&lrm;I told myself: "I got to meet this guy.
&lrm;He's so cool!"

02:13.560 --> 02:15.640
&lrm;What if I was, like, your biggest fan?

02:15.760 --> 02:18.120
&lrm;-Yeah, sure!
&lrm;-Say "cheese"!

02:18.240 --> 02:20.880
&lrm;Me and Adrien.
&lrm;This is the best day of my life!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.280
&lrm;No! Don't post it up on...

02:23.400 --> 02:24.440
&lrm;the Internet.

&lrm;<i>You have got one new alert.</i>

02:28.640 --> 02:30.160
&lrm;Hmm.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.920
&lrm;<i>New destination.</i>

02:35.480 --> 02:39.440
&lrm;Hold up! Could you autograph my cologne
&lrm;bottle and my life-size cut out?

02:41.640 --> 02:43.840
&lrm;Some other time! I've got to get going!

02:43.960 --> 02:46.200
&lrm;No, wait! Adrien!

02:48.040 --> 02:52.120
&lrm;-It's Adrien, from TV!
&lrm;-Can I have an autograph for my daughter?

02:52.880 --> 02:55.360
&lrm;Adrien!

02:58.760 --> 03:03.160
&lrm;<i>-Radiant... Carefree... Dreamy...</i>
&lrm;-Radiant... Carefree... Dreamy...

&lrm;<i>Marinette! I've been waiting for you</i>
&lrm;<i>for 15 minutes! Where are you?</i>

03:10.360 --> 03:14.200
&lrm;I was deciding which swimsuit to wear!

03:14.320 --> 03:16.200
&lrm;<i>-Radiant...</i>
&lrm;<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

03:16.320 --> 03:19.120
&lrm;<i>And Adrien's ad</i>
&lrm;<i>helps you pick out a swimsuit, girl?</i>

03:19.240 --> 03:21.880
&lrm;[laugh] Um, yeah! I'll be right there!

03:24.960 --> 03:28.640
&lrm;Marinette! Marinette!
&lrm;Haven't you forgotten something?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.080
&lrm;I forgot to pack my swimsuit!

03:35.680 --> 03:36.600
&lrm;I have to change!

03:37.360 --> 03:38.480
&lrm;-Marinette?
&lrm;-Adrien?

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
&lrm;You live near here.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.800
&lrm;-Can I hide out at your place?
&lrm;-Uh, at my place? You? Hide out?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.520
&lrm;-Uh, what's going on?
&lrm;-Adrien!

03:44.640 --> 03:46.040
&lrm;Too late!

03:46.480 --> 03:48.880
&lrm;Adrien! There he is!

03:50.000 --> 03:51.440
&lrm;Come with me!

03:52.280 --> 03:54.000
&lrm;Adrien!

04:00.280 --> 04:03.440
&lrm;Thank you for saving me.
&lrm;People are going crazy over this ad!

04:03.560 --> 04:07.960
&lrm;You starred in an ad? I had no idea!
&lrm;Heh, heh! That's awesome!

04:08.080 --> 04:09.320
&lrm;I don't know about that.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.520
&lrm;In fact, it's really quite...
&lrm;embarrassing?

04:12.640 --> 04:14.720
&lrm;Hey! All good now. I'd better get going!

04:18.160 --> 04:20.200
&lrm;Isn't that... your bodyguard?

04:20.320 --> 04:24.800
&lrm;Actually, I snuck out without permission.
&lrm;I'm supposed to be at home right now and--

04:24.920 --> 04:27.000
&lrm;Adrien and his girlfriend in the fountain!

04:28.640 --> 04:30.480
&lrm;-Adrien?
&lrm;-In the fountain?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.640
&lrm;-With Marinette?
&lrm;-Oh!

04:33.600 --> 04:35.440
&lrm;<i>You have got one new alert.</i>

04:39.760 --> 04:42.480
&lrm;[groans]

04:43.400 --> 04:44.640
&lrm;[panting]

04:45.280 --> 04:48.080
&lrm;I'm so sorry I got you
&lrm;in this crazy mess, Marinette!

04:48.200 --> 04:50.160
&lrm;Plus, now everyone thinks
&lrm;you're my girlfriend.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.480
&lrm;Oh! That's terrible! Yeah... I mean, no!

04:53.600 --> 04:57.200
&lrm;I mean, it's not that terrible really,
&lrm;is it? Or... not?

04:57.320 --> 05:00.120
&lrm;Anyway, will things be OK
&lrm;between you and your father?

05:00.240 --> 05:03.320
&lrm;How could anything bad happen
&lrm;with my Marinette Lucky Charm?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.320
&lrm;[scream]

05:18.440 --> 05:22.120
&lrm;-It's Adrien from the ad!
&lrm;-Adrien!

05:22.240 --> 05:24.840
&lrm;[hysteria continues]

05:24.960 --> 05:26.600
&lrm;They look so cute together!

05:26.720 --> 05:28.240
&lrm;We can't stay here!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.920
&lrm;Adrien!

05:57.640 --> 05:58.920
&lrm;Adrien!

05:59.920 --> 06:01.880
&lrm;Look! That's Adrien's bodyguard!

06:04.520 --> 06:05.480
&lrm;I got his phone!

06:11.360 --> 06:14.560
&lrm;<i>-Adrien?</i>
&lrm;-Who are you? And where's my son?

06:14.680 --> 06:17.520
&lrm;<i>Return that phone this minute</i>
&lrm;<i>or I'll have you arrested!</i>

06:18.320 --> 06:21.000
&lrm;They got off the train at Concorde!

06:25.600 --> 06:27.040
&lrm;[groans]

06:27.160 --> 06:28.120
&lrm;Hmm?

06:36.560 --> 06:39.600
&lrm;Master, you don't really think
&lrm;Adrien could be Cat Noir?

06:39.720 --> 06:41.920
&lrm;I don't know, but he's hiding something.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.320
&lrm;Since his bodyguard lost him, there's only
&lrm;one way for us to uncover his secret.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.640
&lrm;Nooroo! Dark wings rise!

07:02.680 --> 07:04.080
&lrm;[groans]

07:05.080 --> 07:06.240
&lrm;Is this your vehicle?

07:06.360 --> 07:08.440
&lrm;What kind of a parking job is this,
&lrm;in the middle of Paris?

07:08.560 --> 07:10.800
&lrm;You think you own the streets?

07:11.960 --> 07:13.280
&lrm;Go on, take it away!

07:15.520 --> 07:19.480
&lrm;And assaulting a police officer on duty?
&lrm;This is not looking good for you!

07:19.600 --> 07:21.120
&lrm;[phone rings]

07:21.240 --> 07:24.840
&lrm;What do you think you're doing?
&lrm;Don't pick up, I'm talking to you!

07:24.960 --> 07:26.760
&lrm;<i>What have you done? Where's Adrien?</i>

07:26.880 --> 07:29.600
&lrm;<i>Don't tell me it's that hard</i>
&lrm;<i>to keep an eye on a boy!</i>

07:29.720 --> 07:34.160
&lrm;<i>Or are you just too stupid to do something</i>
&lrm;<i>so simple? You'd better find him and fast!</i>

07:34.280 --> 07:36.480
&lrm;...and another one, and another one...

07:38.920 --> 07:41.640
&lrm;A failed bodyguard
&lrm;who can't perform his duties.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.040
&lrm;Anger and frustration.
&lrm;Perfect fodder for my akuma.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.000
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him!

08:05.480 --> 08:06.720
&lrm;[groans]

08:09.680 --> 08:12.560
&lrm;Gorizilla, I am Hawk Moth!

08:12.680 --> 08:16.720
&lrm;I'm giving you tracking abilities you'll
&lrm;need to hunt down the person you've lost

08:16.840 --> 08:18.480
&lrm;and accomplish your mission.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.000
&lrm;[groans]

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
&lrm;[screams]

08:28.120 --> 08:30.960
&lrm;[roars]

08:45.840 --> 08:49.200
&lrm;Good thinking! Without the disguises,
&lrm;we'd never have made it here!

08:49.320 --> 08:53.320
&lrm;No, it was your idea to duck into this
&lrm;dark theatre, remember? That was smart!

08:53.440 --> 08:56.600
&lrm;This is where I was heading
&lrm;when those crazed fans showed up.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.800
&lrm;Thanks to you, my father won't find out.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.520
&lrm;Wait.
&lrm;You aren't allowed to go to the movies?

09:01.640 --> 09:04.320
&lrm;I am, with my bodyguard or Nathalie,
&lrm;of course.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.760
&lrm;But I'm not sure my father
&lrm;would have allowed me to see this movie.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.200
&lrm;Oh, no! Please don't tell me
&lrm;it's a horror movie. I hate horror movies!

09:11.960 --> 09:15.680
&lrm;No, don't worry! It's a rare movie
&lrm;I've never been able to see.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.120
&lrm;It's not on the Internet,
&lrm;and my father's hidden the only DVD.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.200
&lrm;You see,
&lrm;my mother played the leading role.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.400
&lrm;Wow. I had no idea.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.840
&lrm;It's only being shown once,
&lrm;today, in this theatre.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.360
&lrm;I couldn't talk to my father about it,
&lrm;so I decided to sneak out, unnoticed.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.280
&lrm;I don't think the "unnoticed" bit
&lrm;went too well, actually!

09:39.720 --> 09:41.480
&lrm;Well, at least I'll get to see it.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.880
&lrm;Not to mention it's the first time
&lrm;I've seen a movie with a friend.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.840
&lrm;<i>Radiant... Carefree...</i>

09:52.560 --> 09:56.840
&lrm;<i>-Dreamy... Adrien, the fragrance!</i>
&lrm;-Dreamy... Adrien, the fragrance!

10:02.320 --> 10:03.400
&lrm;Oh, it's starting!

10:21.920 --> 10:25.760
&lrm;Adrien in a helmet at the movies
&lrm;with his girlfriend wearing a towel!

10:26.320 --> 10:27.920
&lrm;Adrien's at the movies!

10:31.760 --> 10:33.320
&lrm;We're trapped! What are we gonna do?

10:33.680 --> 10:36.680
&lrm;Adrien like movies! I like movies too!

10:41.920 --> 10:44.160
&lrm;[screams]

10:46.560 --> 10:48.280
&lrm;Are you... my bodyguard?

10:48.400 --> 10:49.240
&lrm;[sniffs]

10:53.240 --> 10:54.920
&lrm;Let go of Adrien right now!

10:55.040 --> 10:58.520
&lrm;Stop! I'm the one you wanted.
&lrm;Leave them alone!

10:58.640 --> 11:02.360
&lrm;Gorizilla, you have fulfilled
&lrm;the first part of your mission!

11:02.760 --> 11:06.920
&lrm;Now don't let go of Adrien, not until
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir come to rescue him!

11:11.440 --> 11:13.640
&lrm;Adrien! I'm coming to save you!

11:17.040 --> 11:18.080
&lrm;Adrien needs me!

11:19.280 --> 11:22.360
&lrm;Tikki, spots on! Ha!

11:37.000 --> 11:38.920
&lrm;Put Adrien down, right now!

11:39.040 --> 11:40.960
&lrm;Put Adrien down, right now!

11:51.440 --> 11:54.120
&lrm;[roars]

11:55.160 --> 11:56.080
&lrm;Let him go!

11:59.040 --> 12:00.120
&lrm;Ladybug!

12:00.240 --> 12:05.520
&lrm;She's alone. If Adrien is Cat Noir,
&lrm;then he'll have to transform to help her.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.520
&lrm;Gorizilla, attack Ladybug!

12:17.400 --> 12:19.320
&lrm;There's no use. He's too strong!

12:23.400 --> 12:26.280
&lrm;Cat Noir, where are you?
&lrm;I really need your help, fast!

12:26.400 --> 12:27.920
&lrm;I'm at Montparnasse Tower!

12:34.040 --> 12:35.920
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

12:41.040 --> 12:43.960
&lrm;A helicopter?
&lrm;It isn't really a good time to play!

12:45.800 --> 12:49.720
&lrm;Excellent! Now, take Ladybug's Miraculous
&lrm;while we wait for Cat Noir.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.760
&lrm;-I'm so sorry, Ladybug.
&lrm;-Don't worry!

12:59.320 --> 13:01.880
&lrm;Let me try to manoeuvre this thing!

13:22.600 --> 13:23.840
&lrm;Get Ladybug back!

13:26.880 --> 13:28.200
&lrm;Hold on!

13:31.400 --> 13:32.760
&lrm;Sorry!

13:40.360 --> 13:42.000
&lrm;Let go of Adrien right now!

13:43.680 --> 13:45.680
&lrm;Jump, Adrien! Quick!

13:47.520 --> 13:49.760
&lrm;You have to trust me!

13:49.880 --> 13:52.560
&lrm;Always! Yeah!

13:52.680 --> 13:53.640
&lrm;No!

13:57.040 --> 14:00.640
&lrm;If you don't transform soon,
&lrm;you'll wind up like a pile of camembert!

14:00.760 --> 14:02.720
&lrm;I can't, Plagg.
&lrm;Not in the open like this!

14:02.840 --> 14:05.080
&lrm;I'm sure Ladybug has a plan! I trust her!

14:06.520 --> 14:09.240
&lrm;Don't be scared, Adrien!
&lrm;I'm going to catch you!

14:09.360 --> 14:13.200
&lrm;If indeed you are Cat Noir,
&lrm;then transform, son, please!

14:14.760 --> 14:15.720
&lrm;Come on, son!

14:18.800 --> 14:20.840
&lrm;Cat noir, help!

14:21.480 --> 14:22.640
&lrm;Drop Ladybug!

14:35.720 --> 14:38.400
&lrm;[cheering and applause]

14:42.200 --> 14:45.040
&lrm;Gorizilla, get them back!
&lrm;And don't mess up this time!

14:45.160 --> 14:48.880
&lrm;I just knew I could count on you,
&lrm;Mila... Uh! Ladybug!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.520
&lrm;Adrien! You're safe!

14:52.400 --> 14:54.400
&lrm;Your earrings are flashing.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.360
&lrm;It won't be long before I transform back!
&lrm;But don't worry.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.560
&lrm;Cat Noir will be here soon
&lrm;to take care of things!

15:01.160 --> 15:03.520
&lrm;You can leave! I'll keep him at bay!

15:03.640 --> 15:05.600
&lrm;No. I want you to find
&lrm;a safe place to hide!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.760
&lrm;Oh! OK!

15:13.640 --> 15:16.520
&lrm;You shall not pass!

15:18.880 --> 15:23.880
&lrm;Radiant... Carefree... Dreamy...
&lrm;Adrien, the fragrance!

15:25.600 --> 15:30.400
&lrm;Now you won't be able to sniff out Adrien,
&lrm;will you? Go ahead, try!

15:43.840 --> 15:44.760
&lrm;[roars]

15:48.600 --> 15:49.640
&lrm;I'm coming, Adrien!

15:55.160 --> 15:57.120
&lrm;I think you lost him!

15:57.920 --> 16:00.440
&lrm;Looks like it!
&lrm;Any idea where his akuma could be?

16:01.040 --> 16:03.720
&lrm;You're about to transform back.
&lrm;Leave me here.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.000
&lrm;I'll hide while I wait
&lrm;for Cat Noir to turn up.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.480
&lrm;But what if the supervillain finds you?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.760
&lrm;He's my bodyguard! He won't hurt me!

16:14.800 --> 16:17.080
&lrm;Of course! I know how we can trap him!

16:17.200 --> 16:19.960
&lrm;This way, I'll have time
&lrm;to find out where his akuma is!

16:20.560 --> 16:23.240
&lrm;Meet us at the subway.
&lrm;Adrien agreed to act as a bait,

16:23.360 --> 16:27.200
&lrm;but we really need you and your cataclysm
&lrm;to make this work. Hurry up!

16:27.320 --> 16:31.000
&lrm;-What if Cat Noir doesn't turn up?
&lrm;-Oh, he will. I trust him.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.680
&lrm;You're right. I'm sure he'll be here.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.800
&lrm;What rabbit are you planning
&lrm;to pull out of your hat now?

16:42.920 --> 16:45.680
&lrm;You can't exactly be Cat Noir
&lrm;and Adrien at the same time!

16:45.800 --> 16:47.240
&lrm;And what if I can?

16:49.160 --> 16:50.960
&lrm;I need some help!

16:51.560 --> 16:53.440
&lrm;Adrien!

16:56.920 --> 16:57.920
&lrm;He's coming.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.960
&lrm;Hurry up, Cat Noir!

17:02.520 --> 17:05.280
&lrm;[car alarms go off]

17:07.440 --> 17:08.440
&lrm;Over here!

17:09.040 --> 17:11.160
&lrm;Why don't you pick on someone
&lrm;your own size?

17:14.280 --> 17:17.480
&lrm;Don't worry, Adrien.
&lrm;I won't let him touch a hair on your head!

17:17.599 --> 17:20.280
&lrm;Adrien and Cat Noir, side by side?

17:20.400 --> 17:23.000
&lrm;So I was wrong! Just as well!

17:23.119 --> 17:26.280
&lrm;Gorizilla, grab Cat Noir's Miraculous
&lrm;and be done with him!

17:27.800 --> 17:31.040
&lrm;Missed me! Missed me again!

17:31.160 --> 17:34.680
&lrm;That's it, big guy.
&lrm;Come on, just a little more...

17:35.480 --> 17:36.600
&lrm;There!

17:37.600 --> 17:39.280
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:46.160 --> 17:48.520
&lrm;[scream]

17:50.160 --> 17:53.760
&lrm;This is Cat Noir Express Deliveries.
&lrm;Did you order a giant beast, Milady?

17:53.880 --> 17:55.360
&lrm;I knew I could count on you!

17:55.480 --> 17:57.120
&lrm;-Where's Adrien?
&lrm;<i>-He's safe!</i>

17:57.240 --> 18:00.280
&lrm;I'm very sorry,
&lrm;but I'll have to search your pockets!

18:02.440 --> 18:04.280
&lrm;Here you are!

18:10.640 --> 18:12.800
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:15.960 --> 18:16.880
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:18.240 --> 18:20.320
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.680
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:28.840 --> 18:29.920
&lrm;-Pound it!
&lrm;-Pound it!

18:30.040 --> 18:33.920
&lrm;One of these days, I'll find out
&lrm;who Ladybug and Cat Noir really are!

18:34.040 --> 18:37.280
&lrm;And when I do,
&lrm;I'll make them pay for eternity!

18:41.160 --> 18:42.720
&lrm;Adrien, are you OK?

18:42.840 --> 18:47.760
&lrm;He's totally fine! See, if I were you,
&lrm;I wouldn't hang around too long.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.240
&lrm;Unless you don't mind revealing
&lrm;your secret identity to all of us.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.880
&lrm;Bye, Adrien! Bye, Kitty! Bug out!

18:54.240 --> 18:56.320
&lrm;Gotta scat, too!
&lrm;Thanks for your help, Adrien!

19:01.520 --> 19:06.440
&lrm;That was awesome! I helped Cat Noir
&lrm;save Paris from that nasty big ape!

19:06.560 --> 19:08.600
&lrm;I knew I could count on you.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.000
&lrm;I'm sorry I had to ask you
&lrm;to stand in for me earlier.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.520
&lrm;You must think I'm not very brave.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.160
&lrm;You kidding? I got to be
&lrm;in Adrien's shoes for a few minutes!

19:20.280 --> 19:22.200
&lrm;A dream come true!

19:22.320 --> 19:26.880
&lrm;I'm really sorry I posted that photo
&lrm;on the Internet. You must be mad at me.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.480
&lrm;-Is that your email?
&lrm;-Yeah.

19:30.600 --> 19:35.160
&lrm;If you can manage to stop running after me
&lrm;screaming, I'm sure we can be friends.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.760
&lrm;I promise, Adrien!

19:36.880 --> 19:41.200
&lrm;Oh, Tikki! I went to the movies
&lrm;with Adrien! It's best day of my life!

19:41.800 --> 19:45.360
&lrm;Oh, no! I went to the movies
&lrm;with Adrien in my pyjamas,

19:45.480 --> 19:47.240
&lrm;wearing funny glasses and a towel!

19:47.520 --> 19:49.240
&lrm;It's the worst day of my life!

19:49.360 --> 19:50.400
&lrm;[phone rings]

19:50.600 --> 19:51.680
&lrm;Alya!

19:52.160 --> 19:56.360
&lrm;<i>OK, Marinette, we all saw your pics</i>
&lrm;<i>online, but we're totally lost!</i>

19:56.480 --> 19:58.720
&lrm;<i>-We need the scoop!</i>
&lrm;-Right. Not surprised!

19:58.840 --> 20:02.200
&lrm;I'll just change, then I'll be right over.
&lrm;Wait. Where are you?

20:02.320 --> 20:05.840
&lrm;At the swimming pool?
&lrm;We're still waiting, girl!

20:05.960 --> 20:07.400
&lrm;[laughter]

20:12.480 --> 20:14.000
&lrm;Sit down, Adrien.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.160
&lrm;All you had to do was ask me.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.840
&lrm;I'm sorry, Father. I tried to talk to you,
&lrm;but you were so busy.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.080
&lrm;In fact, I always feel
&lrm;like you don't want to talk at all, so...

20:34.200 --> 20:38.400
&lrm;You should have trusted me, son.
&lrm;We should be able to trust each other.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.960
&lrm;If you were to begin
&lrm;hiding the truth from me,

20:41.080 --> 20:44.960
&lrm;then I'd naturally start imagining
&lrm;all kinds of things.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.600
&lrm;Right, Father. Thank you.
