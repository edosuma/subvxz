WEBVTT

00:00.125 --> 00:05.129
So, you got a Green Beret,
a Navy SEAL and a sister from Brooklyn.

00:05.255 --> 00:08.132
The general hands
each of them a gun and says,

00:08.258 --> 00:11.636
"Your spouse is seated next door
in a room in a chair.

00:11.762 --> 00:15.098
"In order to pass this test,
you must go inside and kill them."

00:16.517 --> 00:18.059
Immediately
the Green Beret says,

00:18.185 --> 00:20.728
"No, sir, I could never kill my wife.
I just can't do it."

00:20.854 --> 00:22.814
The General looks at him
and says, "You know what?

00:22.940 --> 00:26.025
"You ain't got what it takes.
Take your wife and go on home."

00:26.151 --> 00:27.360
Navy Seal then heads in.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.279
Five minutes later, comes out,
tears strolling down his face.

00:30.406 --> 00:32.448
"I tried, I tried, I tried,
I just can't do it,

00:32.574 --> 00:34.909
"she looked so beautiful
in the chair, I can't do it."

00:35.035 --> 00:36.828
General looks at him and says,
"You know what?

00:36.954 --> 00:38.246
"You ain't got what it takes."

00:38.372 --> 00:41.791
Finally, sister from Brooklyn
strolls in with a swagger.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.043
Shots rang out,

00:44.169 --> 00:45.920
there's banging, there's screaming,
it's going crazy!

00:46.046 --> 00:48.089
Suddenly,
everything goes silent.

00:49.425 --> 00:51.259
The General says,
"Well, what the hell happened inside?"

00:51.385 --> 00:52.677
The sister from Brooklyn
screams back,

00:52.803 --> 00:54.762
"The damn gun
had blanks in it,

00:54.888 --> 00:57.432
"so I had to beat him to death
with my bare..."

00:58.392 --> 00:59.559
What the hell?

00:59.685 --> 01:01.310
A little bit of warning
would have been nice!

01:01.437 --> 01:02.854
The sound of a saw
cutting a hole in the wall

01:02.980 --> 01:03.896
wasn't warning enough?

01:04.022 --> 01:04.856
Bite me.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.952
What, are you kidding me? Tub of Goo
there's gotta be over six bills.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.829
You ain't gonna lift him
with a couple of blankets.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.289
You got a better idea,
Einstein?

01:21.415 --> 01:22.957
Yeah, just roll him off.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.752
What? He's already dead,
it ain't like he's gonna feel it.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.253
How the hell's
a guy get that big?

01:27.379 --> 01:28.254
You roll him off
from this high,

01:28.380 --> 01:29.922
he's likely to go right
through the floor and take us with him.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.884
Are you ready?
All right, one, two, lift!

01:35.304 --> 01:36.262
Come on, man!

01:36.388 --> 01:37.764
Me? You're the kielbasa king.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.015
It wasn't me.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.642
Whoa, it wasn't me, either.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.355
Don't look at me.

01:50.194 --> 01:51.903
Please tell me
dead guys can fart.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.030
Of course. Dead bodies are full
of all sorts of gases.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.448
But a dead body
can't tighten a sphincter.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.116
You need a tight sphincter
to make a fart.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.659
No, you need a loose sphincter.
A tight sphincter...

01:58.786 --> 02:00.369
You check his femoral?

02:00.496 --> 02:03.247
No. He peed all over himself!

02:03.373 --> 02:05.917
Look, I've heard dead bodies
moan, groan, hiss,

02:06.043 --> 02:07.668
hell, I've even seen them
sit straight up on a gurney.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.130
Trust me, his skin's cold, pupils are
fixed and dilated, he's not breathing.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.132
- He's got a pulse!
- No way.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.885
All right, give me an Ambu bag and
an EKG. It's thready, but it's there.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.595
Let's get him in a basket.
Ready?

02:17.721 --> 02:19.680
One, two, lift!

02:55.050 --> 02:57.760
Forty-six-year-old guy
in a coma.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.679
Doesn't appear to be
anything wrong with him

02:59.805 --> 03:01.973
except for the fact
that he weighs over 600 pounds.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.266
What time
does he usually get in?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.184
Any time between
8:00 and 10:00.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.978
- Did you say 600?
- At least.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.896
Biggest scale we got
only goes up to 350

03:09.022 --> 03:11.315
but this guy's waistline
is over seven feet.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.360
Which means he's a diabetic
with blood thicker than pancake batter.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.195
No mystery there,
not much we can do.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.280
Blood sugar's normal.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.950
Cholesterol's lower than mine,
tox screen's clean, no sign of trauma.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.535
Sure there wasn't
a mix-up at the lab?

03:22.661 --> 03:24.120
Three times?

03:24.246 --> 03:26.455
It's almost 11:00,
where is House?

04:10.834 --> 04:11.876
Hello!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.171
It's 11:00.

04:15.297 --> 04:19.550
Which means my friend is ready for his
sponge bath and I shouldn't be here!

04:21.011 --> 04:25.514
Hey, Gomer Pyle!
I know you can hear me.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.902
I think you mean Barney Fife.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.947
So many great idiot icons
to choose from.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.408
You need time
to think of some more?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.577
Either arraign me
or let me go.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.038
No problem.
Which do you prefer?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.008
What took you so long?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.303
Sorry. I didn't have 15 grand
in my loose change jar.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.639
- What the hell did you do?
- Nothing.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.184
Your motorcycle was impounded,
that explains the speeding, DUI,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.602
and driving
without a license.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.189
The fact that you're you explains
the illegal possession of narcotics

05:15.315 --> 05:17.233
and resisting arrest.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.528
Where's your car?

05:20.654 --> 05:21.737
What happened?

05:21.863 --> 05:24.782
Some idiot cop with crotch rot
obviously thought

05:24.908 --> 05:27.535
that I didn't treat him with the
deference due to a man of his stature.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.161
He trumped up a traffic stop,

05:29.287 --> 05:30.830
next thing I know
I'm sharing a cage

05:30.956 --> 05:32.206
with a guy
who thinks that showers

05:32.332 --> 05:34.750
are the way the devil
gets inside you.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.002
Does Cuddy know?

05:36.128 --> 05:38.045
Everything she needs to.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.424
- I'm innocent.
- Till proven guilty.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.301
Guy wanted to punish me,
he did it. It's over.

05:44.428 --> 05:45.511
Gotta get yourself a lawyer.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.554
Already got one.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.390
You know what they say about the lawyer
who has himself as a client?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.767
Same thing they say
about the doctor who lends 15 grand

05:51.893 --> 05:54.311
to a friend he knows
can't pay him back.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.648
Relax, you'll get it.
Where am I gonna take off to?

06:02.863 --> 06:05.614
Does Salma Hayek
live in Mexico or Spain?

06:07.576 --> 06:10.578
There's nothing abnormal in the EEG
or the neurological exam.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.663
I'm guessing
it's food-related.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.248
Improperly prepared
puffer fish

06:14.374 --> 06:15.708
can have toxins
that could cause a coma

06:15.834 --> 06:18.419
and might not show up
on the tox screen.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.046
Where do you think he is?

06:20.172 --> 06:21.505
He's probably
at the track.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.674
If he's at the track he'd tell us
so we don't have to page him,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.343
and if it was a puffer fish, he'd
be dead in six to eight hours, tops.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.803
He's been in a coma
at least 24.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.973
And the guy didn't get to 600 pounds
eating a load of sushi.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.475
What if he was
in a motorcycle accident?

06:32.601 --> 06:35.144
Explains the coma.
But how'd he get back in bed?

06:35.270 --> 06:37.772
Oh, Cameron's talking
about House!

06:37.898 --> 06:39.106
You ever see how he drives?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.232
No, we haven't.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.193
But I have seen how many pills
he's been popping lately,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.904
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's in a coma somewhere himself.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.031
If I am, this is
one lame hallucination.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.157
What happened to you?

06:48.283 --> 06:51.452
If you ever end up in a bar with the Cambridge Women's
Heavyweight Eight,

06:51.578 --> 06:54.371
do not accept an offer
of an upside-down kamikaze shot.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.332
- We have a case.
- Fat guy in a coma, I know.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.374
- Cuddy found you?
- Nope.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.043
But the wall
between Wilson's office

06:59.169 --> 07:00.503
and this one
is thinner than you'd think.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.712
Which means
we need to stop talking

07:01.838 --> 07:03.464
about what a pathetic loser
he is.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.092
Start treating Jabba
for pickwickian syndrome.

07:06.218 --> 07:10.262
His 96 double-Zs are probably putting
pressure on his chest, suffocating him.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.056
CO2 and oxygen
sats are normal.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.642
For you and me.
What's normal for a hippopotamus?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.102
And get
a detailed medical history.

07:16.228 --> 07:17.311
From who?
He was brought in alone.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.898
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600 pounds
bothers with annual physicals.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.691
Talk to the neighbors
and search the house.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.028
Let's see what else
Shamu's been up to besides eating.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.863
This conversation is over

07:27.989 --> 07:31.951
because I've officially run out
of clever things to call the guy.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.419
It's hard to believe you can even attach
this much flesh to a human skeleton.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.631
I wouldn't exactly
call this attached.

07:45.757 --> 07:46.674
This is ridiculous.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.218
A person shouldn't be able to
eat themselves into oblivion

07:49.344 --> 07:52.179
and then just expect everyone
to pull out the stops to fix everything.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.266
What are we supposed to do?
Refuse treatment to anyone who's obese?

07:55.392 --> 07:58.060
Come on, give me a break.
This guy's not obese.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.855
He's not even morbidly obese.
He's suicidal.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.523
People who attempt suicide
get treated.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.441
Plenty of noncompliant
diabetics don't.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.277
We don't give
drug addicts dialysis

08:06.403 --> 08:08.654
or alcoholics
liver transplants.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.114
What is your problem?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.824
You get beat up
by a gang of fat kids

08:11.950 --> 08:13.159
when you were in grade school
or something?

08:13.285 --> 08:16.245
Yeah. I'm the one
with the problem.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.165
So, I think
his bedroom's through there,

08:19.291 --> 08:21.500
and the kitchen's
to the left.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.502
Have you seen any changes
in his personality?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.838
Any trouble with memory
or balance?

08:25.964 --> 08:28.799
No, but I really
don't see him that often.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.509
He's not unfriendly
or anything,

08:30.635 --> 08:32.678
I guess he just likes
to keep to himself.

08:32.804 --> 08:36.640
I think he only gave me a spare set
of keys 'cause I gave him mine.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.101
What?

08:39.227 --> 08:43.147
Nothing. Just reminds me
of someone I know. Who is unfriendly.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.857
Does George have a job?

08:44.983 --> 08:47.109
He has a headhunting business
he runs from home.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.153
Occasionally
he'll interview people here,

08:49.279 --> 08:51.238
but he does most of it
over the phone.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.531
Wow!

08:52.657 --> 08:55.451
Yeah, he loves to cook.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.745
And eat, obviously.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.289
Four-course gourmet meals
almost every night,

09:00.415 --> 09:01.498
sometimes for lunch, too.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.627
Do you know if he ever uses
any unpasteurized cheese or wild game?

09:04.753 --> 09:05.836
I'm not sure.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.756
He gets all his groceries delivered
from that market down on Alden.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.466
They'd probably know.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.386
- He have any friends?
- No.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.014
I mean, sometimes women
do come by.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.227
Young, attractive, never the same one
twice, if you know what I mean.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.186
I see.

09:22.312 --> 09:26.065
There can't be many women
who'd wanna be with a guy like him.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.448
It's usually worst
in the morning.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.033
Especially
if I've slept on my arm.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.036
If I sleep on my back
or with my arms out, I'm usually okay.

09:40.247 --> 09:44.166
So your arm only hurts
after you lie on top of it all night.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.251
Yeah.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.047
Well, have you thought about,
I don't know, not doing that?

09:50.173 --> 09:53.008
Yeah. But it's how I sleep,
it's how I've always slept.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.218
Well, there's always surgery.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.262
To do what? Like, clean out
some cartilage or something?

09:56.388 --> 10:00.266
You're not sleeping on some cartilage,
you're sleeping on your arm.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.309
You wanna remove my arm?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.271
Well, it is your left.
You know, a guy's gotta sleep.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.606
Are you insane?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.952
I see spending a night in jail
hasn't humbled you a bit.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.288
While following
my every move is flattering,

10:22.414 --> 10:26.041
a single rose on my doorstep
each morning would be more enticing.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.835
Just bringing your boss
up to speed,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.629
which I guess
you didn't feel was necessary.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.631
You gonna add that
to my list of charges?

10:32.757 --> 10:36.010
People who are innocent
tend not to try to hide their arrest.

10:36.136 --> 10:40.264
Is that based on your years of
experience arresting innocent people?

10:42.225 --> 10:43.934
The way
you're going at that gum,

10:44.060 --> 10:46.395
it's obviously not having
the desired effect.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.732
You're the addict. You're gonna be back
on the butts in a month.

10:49.858 --> 10:53.360
You're just taking out your frustration
on me 'cause my meds actually work.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.988
Why don't you quit
while you're ahead.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.698
Before you end up
as a security guard

10:57.824 --> 11:00.159
working the night shift
at some strip mall.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.162
I think working around
a bunch of nurses

11:03.288 --> 11:06.498
has given you a false sense
of your ability to intimidate.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.675
Who was that?

11:17.886 --> 11:20.721
Apparently Cuddy's widened
her sperm donor search

11:20.847 --> 11:22.473
to include Neanderthals.

11:22.599 --> 11:25.017
Cuddy's looking for
a sperm donor?

11:25.935 --> 11:29.355
It was a joke.
Like Cuddy would ever want a kid.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.564
Or a kid
would ever want Cuddy.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.900
Hello, that's why it's funny!

11:33.401 --> 11:34.777
Why are you guys here?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.320
It's not pickwick's.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.364
Intubation and steroids
have had no effect.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.240
Except maybe to cause
whatever it is to get worse.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.325
He's got a fever now.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.534
What'd you find out?

11:42.660 --> 11:45.329
That you and George have the same taste
in home furnishings and women.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.206
Danish Modern
and Russian gymnasts?

11:47.332 --> 11:48.499
Pianos and prostitutes.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.376
We should do an LP
and look for neurosyphilis.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.336
- It's not syphilis.
- How do you know?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.546
Because you get STDs
from people you trust,

11:54.672 --> 11:56.757
people you don't feel
the need to protect yourself from.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.468
Whatever he has is connected to his gut,
not what's below it.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.220
MRI his brain,
look for clots.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.264
Weight limit
on the MRI machine is 450 pounds.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.641
So do a CT.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.351
Limit's 350.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.852
Then just start treatment.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.771
If we give him blood thinners
and the coma's caused

12:10.897 --> 12:12.439
by a bleed instead of a clot,
we could kill him.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.859
Either start treatment
or start building a stronger MRI.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.277
Whatever you do, do it fast.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.529
The longer
he stays in the coma,

12:18.655 --> 12:21.532
the less likely it is
he'll ever wake up.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.786
There's no way.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.705
His head's the only part
that we have to get in the machine.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.207
If we can just
get him on the table...

12:30.333 --> 12:32.126
We get him on the table,
we break the table.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.545
We break the table,
hospital's out a million dollars

12:34.671 --> 12:35.504
and we're out of our jobs.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.881
The weight limit's
obviously just an estimation.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.092
It's not like if it can hold
450 pounds fine,

12:40.218 --> 12:42.177
it'll instantly collapse
under 451.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.056
He's not one pound over,
he's 150 pounds over.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.393
I don't care! He still deserves the
same standard of care as anyone else.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.771
Then you believe the machine
will stand on principle.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.653
You guys gonna help or not?

13:01.739 --> 13:03.240
How much
does this guy weigh?

13:03.366 --> 13:05.367
- 440.
- Looks like a lot more than that.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.660
It's 'cause he's lying down.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.121
You guys ready?
One, two, three.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.265
- Here.
- What's this?

13:29.184 --> 13:31.101
I made some calls for you.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.103
The guy's the best criminal attorney
in Princeton.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.354
Thanks, but I don't need it.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.231
I assume
you told Inspector Clouseau

13:36.357 --> 13:38.150
that I have a valid prescription
for the Vicodin.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.861
Yeah, and I assume you did as well.
Did it make a difference?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.112
The guy's pissed!

13:42.238 --> 13:45.157
And with the DEA now treating
pain doctors like Colombian...

13:45.283 --> 13:47.868
I'm not a pain doctor,
I'm a pain patient.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.205
Tell it to your lawyer.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.180
No midline shifts,
no bleeds, clots, infarcts.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.806
I don't see
any edema, either.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.517
So what do we do now?

14:11.643 --> 14:12.601
An LP.

14:12.727 --> 14:15.521
Even if it's not an STD, a fever points
toward some sort of infection.

14:15.647 --> 14:19.441
I'm not sure we can do an LP
on a guy his size.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.153
What?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.489
You have to be able to palpate the spine
to know where to go.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.157
We could use fluoroscopy
to guide us.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.493
He still wouldn't be able
to bring his knees up and bend forward

14:29.619 --> 14:30.911
in order to open the space
between...

14:34.999 --> 14:36.625
George, it's all right,
you're in a hospital!

14:36.751 --> 14:38.585
Calm down, man, calm down!

14:38.711 --> 14:40.379
- Get him out already!
- I'm trying!

14:40.505 --> 14:41.547
Come on!

14:44.926 --> 14:46.468
We're gonna get you out!

14:55.228 --> 14:57.396
We still have no idea
why he was in the coma to begin with.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.314
Or why he woke up.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.775
It was probably
just some sort of head trauma

15:01.901 --> 15:02.776
and we missed the swelling

15:02.902 --> 15:05.654
because, well,
his head's already swollen.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.906
Bump on the noggin
doesn't explain the fever.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.867
An infection made worse by the steroids
we gave him for pickwick's does.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.953
He's not worse,
he's better.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.956
We just replaced
the last MRI you broke.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.001
Referring to the fund-raising funbags
by the royal "we" now?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.794
Let me explain
cause and effect to you.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.006
I specifically told them
to skip the boring testing part

15:24.132 --> 15:25.424
and jump right to
the dangerous treatment.

15:25.550 --> 15:28.343
You blow stuff up,
makes my life miserable,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.054
makes me need to make
your life miserable.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.764
He's telling the truth.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.647
Kids these days, got no respect
for other people's property.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.524
Repairmen cost less
than lawyers.

15:43.818 --> 15:46.445
Morbid obesity
is a legally defined disability,

15:46.571 --> 15:48.572
which means
if we'd denied access to the MRI,

15:48.698 --> 15:52.075
he could have sued us for discrimination
as well as malpractice.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.744
This was your idea?

15:53.870 --> 15:54.828
Yeah.

16:05.173 --> 16:08.634
Looks like Cameron's gonna be having
a lot more ideas in future.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.553
Who knew that being bloated and bitchy
could actually come in handy?

16:11.679 --> 16:13.263
- Shut up.
- What if it is hormones?

16:13.389 --> 16:14.514
It's not hormones.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.891
I'm talking about George.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.894
Acute adrenal insufficiency
could cause a temporary coma.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.730
A glandular problem would cause
his temperature to be low, not high.

16:21.856 --> 16:22.981
Maybe the fever's
not related.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.691
If it's not related,
there's nothing to talk about.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.735
We should do
an ACTH stimulation test

16:26.861 --> 16:28.779
and check his skin
for acanthosis nigricans.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.907
Or the fever is related
and so are the prostitutes.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.785
We should do a full STD panel
and check his genitals for chancres.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.078
We should do nothing.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.413
Just keep him a couple of days
for observation.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.539
If he doesn't get any worse,

16:39.666 --> 16:43.293
it was probably just a hematoma
that dissipated on its own.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.921
Or we do all of the above.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.256
You check his belly
for patches.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.050
You check underneath
for sores.

16:50.176 --> 16:53.470
And you just sit on your ass.

16:59.268 --> 17:03.313
Acanthosis nigricans
is a hyperpigmentation of the skin,

17:03.439 --> 17:06.108
usually indicates some sort
of hormonal imbalance.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.151
There's nothing wrong
with my hormones.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.154
It's the first thing every doctor
I've ever gone to has checked.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.990
Then it's the blood pressure,
then it's gotta be diabetes.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.536
They all figure there's gotta be
something wrong with me.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.663
You having any problems
with your vision?

17:19.789 --> 17:22.666
No, I have nystagmus.
I've had it since birth, I'm fine.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.835
You're not fine.
You were in a coma for two days.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.044
There's something wrong
with you.

17:26.170 --> 17:30.173
Was something wrong with me,
now I'm better, now I'd like to go home.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.718
A coma's not like
a stomach ache.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.011
You can't just shrug it off
and hope it's not anything serious.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.514
My company places
a lot of insurance executives.

17:37.640 --> 17:42.853
There are over 300,000 deaths
caused each year by medical mistakes

17:42.979 --> 17:46.857
and hospital-associated infections.
I'll come in for tests.

17:46.983 --> 17:50.527
There are over 400,000 deaths
caused by obesity-related illnesses.

17:50.653 --> 17:54.197
The CDC says those figures
are a gross overestimation.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.576
George, you ever notice
you don't see a lot of obese old men?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.828
If I'm gonna
have a heart attack,

17:59.954 --> 18:05.542
I would rather it be caused
by a perfect pan-roasted ris de veau

18:06.169 --> 18:10.630
than running 26 miles for no reason
other than to brag that I can do it.

18:10.757 --> 18:15.010
Or to have an MRI machine
break in the middle of a procedure!

18:15.136 --> 18:16.470
We're sorry about that.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.722
It was the only way to rule out
a stroke or brain hemorrhage.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.100
And now that you have,
when can I go?

18:31.027 --> 18:32.736
It's probably her mom.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.031
I bet she's huge.
She's from the Midwest.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.784
Since when do you eat beets?

18:38.910 --> 18:39.951
Since I was five.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.287
And who are we talking about?
You know, just in case you need me

18:42.413 --> 18:44.456
to chime in and tell you
you're a lunatic at some point?

18:44.582 --> 18:48.043
Cameron. She's lying,
destroying hospital equipment,

18:48.169 --> 18:49.461
telling Cuddy off.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.880
I gotta find out
where she got the Fat Scratch Fever.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.216
Yeah, you definitely better
get to the bottom of that.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.926
I heard Cuddy gave you
the name of a lawyer.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.930
Or it could just be pity. She feels
guilty about being born beautiful.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.682
So she overcompensates
by being nice to ugly people.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.684
Would explain why
she gets along so well with you.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.395
From what I hear,
the patient reminds her of you, not me.

19:07.522 --> 19:08.355
Call the lawyer.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.690
Cameron sees a clump of dirt
and she thinks of me.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.778
Or a lump of something else.
You're a lunatic. Call the lawyer.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.991
- Very mature.
- You started it.

19:20.117 --> 19:23.036
Skin exam and ACTH stimulation test
were both normal.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.205
He has nystagmus
but it's congenital.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.665
No way it's related
to the coma.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.960
You say, "No way,"
I say... Yeah, no way.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.420
Blood and urine were negative
for chlamydia, herpes, and syphilis.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.297
Looks like
we got ourselves a mystery.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.842
Not for long.
He wants to be discharged.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.219
Oh, sure.
Places to go, people to eat.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.428
He insists
his chance of dying

19:40.555 --> 19:41.680
from a hospital-acquired
infection

19:41.806 --> 19:43.932
is greater than him dying
from whatever caused his coma.

19:44.058 --> 19:48.103
Did you tell him that statistics
also say that he's a big, fat idiot?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.105
- Yeah, I did.
- He's not backing down.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.065
He says if we don't discharge him,
he'll leave AMA.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.652
Selectively rational,
stubborn, uncooperative,

19:55.778 --> 19:57.571
maybe you ought to
check his leg.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.826
Do you see what he did there?
The patient's like me.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.744
The patient's three mes.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.746
If I were him...

20:10.251 --> 20:12.919
Maybe it's not
such a mystery after all.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.930
Enjoying your Salisbury steak?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.891
Putting chopped parsley
in a hamburger

20:26.017 --> 20:28.101
does not
a Salisbury steak make.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.313
You must be Dr. House.

20:31.772 --> 20:36.234
And you must be
full of baloney. A lot of it.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.696
Right. Fat joke. Always fun.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.823
The only people
you can still make fun of.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.576
And Christians.
Oh, and black people.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.913
No one in their right mind
comes out of a coma

20:48.039 --> 20:50.290
and immediately asks to go home
with an unknown condition,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.167
which means that either
you're not in your right mind

20:52.293 --> 20:53.710
or it's not
an unknown condition.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.962
So, what is it?
You tried to off yourself?

20:56.088 --> 21:00.133
You figure I'm fat,
therefore I hate myself.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.761
Yeah, that's a huge leap
of logic.

21:02.887 --> 21:06.139
I don't wanna die.
I just don't wanna be here.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.516
Then it's a condition
you've already had diagnosed,

21:08.643 --> 21:10.185
or it's something
you know you've inherited.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.687
Let's see, your stomach
has deep-seated feelings

21:12.813 --> 21:14.147
of abandonment
written all over it,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.274
which points toward
sexual abuse.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.362
While a fear of hospitals, that points
to a more specific traumatic event.

21:20.488 --> 21:24.950
So I'm gonna say, your mom
in the hospital with a candlestick.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.328
And by candlestick, of course,
I mean inherited OTC deficiency.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.748
My parents are both alive and well
and living in Boca Raton.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.833
Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.335
I have no idea what that is.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.754
- Leukoencephalopathy.
- Will you stop!

21:39.298 --> 21:41.841
If I knew what was wrong,
I would tell you.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.844
I'm not an imbecile,
and I'm not miserable.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.515
I'm just overweight.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.813
What?

21:55.356 --> 21:56.356
When?

21:58.776 --> 22:00.360
To be continued.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.553
What are you doing here?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.888
Executing a search
of the premises.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.850
When you...
When you got bailed out

22:31.976 --> 22:34.853
before we could get a judge
to approve this,

22:36.105 --> 22:38.857
I almost didn't bother.

22:38.983 --> 22:42.944
I thought for sure you'd come
straight home and throw everything out.

22:43.070 --> 22:47.323
Rookie mistake. Never underestimate
the stupidity of an addict.

22:48.617 --> 22:52.954
There's gotta be
over 600 Vicodin in here.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.874
Which most DAs would say
proves intent to traffic.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.128
Even if all you really intended was
to simply be wasted 24/7

23:00.254 --> 23:01.379
while practicing medicine.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.340
In case you hadn't noticed,
those are prescription bottles.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.052
I'm not an expert
on linguistics per se,

23:07.178 --> 23:10.180
but I think that means
they were prescribed.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.434
All these
were legally prescribed

23:14.560 --> 23:16.603
to a man
who's in constant pain

23:16.729 --> 23:17.854
but never misses
a day of work?

23:17.980 --> 23:20.565
Has it ever occurred to you
that's why I don't miss a day?

23:20.691 --> 23:24.152
Yeah. Yeah, crossed my mind.
Among other things.

23:24.278 --> 23:28.406
Like what an unprofessional,
unethical, arrogant ass you are.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.869
Because if you're unprofessional
in one area,

23:32.995 --> 23:34.704
it only makes sense.

23:35.998 --> 23:40.794
Now maybe just a few of these
are in someone else's name.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.130
Forged prescription,

23:44.256 --> 23:47.926
or just, um, swiped from the pharmacy
when nobody's looking.

23:50.596 --> 23:55.141
No, but, well,
you wouldn't do that. Right?

24:04.693 --> 24:05.735
Send him home.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.487
Why? You think he's healthy?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.030
Either I'm right,

24:09.156 --> 24:11.866
he knows what's wrong,
he's just too stubborn to admit it,

24:11.992 --> 24:13.952
or I was right
and it's pickwick's.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.912
The treatment
just had a delayed effect.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.914
You don't have
delayed effects to oxygen.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.541
And Pickwick's
doesn't explain the fever.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.751
Being engulfed
in an electric blanket of blubber

24:21.877 --> 24:23.002
could explain the fever.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.421
Yesterday you insisted
we keep him here because of the fever.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.006
We have no idea
what's wrong with the guy.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.425
For all we know
he could be dead in 12 hours.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.261
He does not want our help.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.471
Which means
he doesn't want your help.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.474
He's obviously just rationalizing.
And so are you!

24:36.600 --> 24:37.934
You would never give up
this easy

24:38.060 --> 24:41.646
if you weren't so busy dealing with
your own personal problems.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.773
Send him home.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.900
What did you tell that cop?

24:46.026 --> 24:48.319
- Nothing.
- Nothing as in nothing?

24:48.445 --> 24:49.988
Or as in nothing
that could cause him to think

24:50.114 --> 24:51.614
I have a stash
in my apartment?

24:51.740 --> 24:54.659
He called to see if I prescribed
the pills, I said yes. That's all.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.619
- Obviously not.
- What happened?

24:56.745 --> 24:59.914
He searched my house,
found a buttload of pills.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.458
Guy's gotta be prepared
for a rainy day.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.961
Last I checked pharmacies
were still open when it rained.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.589
And because I never know when
you're gonna be in one of your moods

25:07.715 --> 25:09.799
- and cut me off.
- Oh, it's my fault.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.384
I'm not the one
who talked to the cop.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.470
Well, I'm not the one
who put a thermometer in his rectum.

25:14.597 --> 25:18.057
So stop yelling at me
and start talking to your lawyer.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.521
Is there someone
who can check on you?

25:23.647 --> 25:24.606
Oh, don't worry.

25:24.732 --> 25:27.859
There's gonna be a whole crew
of carpenters in my bedroom

25:27.985 --> 25:29.861
for the next week at least.

25:30.446 --> 25:34.657
You know, there's an Overeaters
Anonymous meeting here at the hospital.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.911
If I wanted to jump out of airplanes
or climb Mount Everest,

25:38.037 --> 25:40.663
would you be telling me
to go to Daredevils Anonymous?

25:40.789 --> 25:42.916
I would be worried about you
just like I am now.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.167
Don't be.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.877
I enjoy food.

25:46.378 --> 25:50.006
I like cooking it, I like looking at it,
I like smelling it,

25:50.132 --> 25:52.508
and I especially
like eating it.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.971
Listen, whatever happens
is gonna happen.

25:57.932 --> 26:01.351
Ultimately it's all
out of our control anyway.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.727
Why doesn't
that philosophy apply

26:02.853 --> 26:06.564
to medical mistakes and
hospital-acquired infections as well?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.860
I'm a complicated man,
Dr. Cameron.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.989
But don't worry, I plan on staying
that way for a long time.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.658
Wait, wait, let us take you
all the way outside.

26:16.784 --> 26:17.992
I'm fine.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.411
It doesn't matter,
it's hospital rules.

26:20.537 --> 26:23.665
Oh, screw the rules.
I've been on my back for four days.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.208
I need the exercise, right?

26:25.334 --> 26:27.085
George, come on,
let us just take you to the taxi.

26:27.211 --> 26:31.506
Don't worry, I may not be able
to climb Everest, but I can walk, okay?

26:31.632 --> 26:33.925
- George...
- Now enough already.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.142
George, are you all right?

26:48.065 --> 26:50.775
George? You all right? George?

26:59.201 --> 27:01.202
Disorientation
and loss of balance

27:01.328 --> 27:03.621
could mean
a neurofibromatosis.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.039
- Where's Chase?
- Don't know.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.667
Haven't seen him since you told him
to sit on his ass yesterday.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.252
Interesting.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.796
NF2 is also inherited,
which means I was right.

27:11.922 --> 27:12.880
You kept saying
it was pickwick's.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.799
Between the first pickwick's
and the second pickwick's,

27:14.925 --> 27:15.758
I said it was inherited.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.927
Whatever.
NF2 doesn't explain fever.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.804
I think we should focus
on the coma and the fever.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.140
Why? The disorientation
and loss of balance are more recent.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.516
The coma was
the most severe symptom.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.894
But he's not in the coma anymore
and he is disoriented.

27:27.021 --> 27:28.771
No, he's not.

27:28.897 --> 27:32.317
We have a rather large piece
of tempered glass that begs to differ.

27:32.443 --> 27:35.028
I just mean
it's not connected.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.487
You don't know that.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.447
Yeah, I do.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.740
How could
you possibly know...

27:38.866 --> 27:40.867
Because I did it!

27:44.371 --> 27:46.956
I didn't think
he should be discharged,

27:47.082 --> 27:49.834
so I gave him
three grams of phenytoin.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.627
I wasn't gonna just
let him leave.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.380
But you were okay with him
crashing through a glass wall?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.258
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair,
but he's tough to stop.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.302
Nice audible, Peyton.

28:00.471 --> 28:02.055
So, what do we do now?

28:02.181 --> 28:05.058
Discharge report says
he didn't eat his breakfast.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.935
Humpty Dumpty didn't get to be the size
of all the king's horses

28:08.062 --> 28:09.937
by skipping
the most important meal of the day.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.774
What causes coma, fever,
and loss of appetite?

28:12.900 --> 28:15.193
It can't be Chagas',
he's never been outside the country.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.194
But his stomach has.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.738
The food we eat no longer
comes from America's heartland.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.491
It comes from South America's
deforested jungle land

28:21.617 --> 28:24.160
where lettuce now grows
and lettuce pickers now poop.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.495
Get a sample of his CSF

28:25.621 --> 28:28.748
before the bugs that are now feasting
on his brain move on to dessert.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.043
How are we gonna do that?
He's too big to do an LP.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.962
So go straight to the source.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.592
You wanna drill a hole
in my head?

28:39.718 --> 28:40.802
It's the only way.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.846
It's gotta be something
other than a parasite.

28:43.972 --> 28:48.309
I buy my produce at the best market
in town and I always wash it.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.311
Leafy vegetables
can suck contaminated water

28:50.437 --> 28:51.938
through their roots
right into the plant.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.689
You could have
washed them in chlorine

28:53.816 --> 28:55.608
and it still
wouldn't have mattered.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.319
Then other people
would be sick as well.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.988
The parasites could have been
on only a few items,

29:01.115 --> 29:02.949
or maybe they just didn't eat
as much as you did.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.827
It's always
about my weight, isn't it?

29:05.953 --> 29:08.496
Why can't you people
come up with one theory...

29:08.622 --> 29:09.956
This one fits, George.

29:10.082 --> 29:14.293
It explains your coma,
your fever, your loss of appetite...

29:19.258 --> 29:22.051
And the disorientation?

29:23.137 --> 29:24.554
It's all explained.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.889
And if we don't treat it
while it's still in the acute stage,

29:27.015 --> 29:28.057
it'll be too late.

29:28.183 --> 29:31.352
It could go on to infect your heart,
intestines, esophagus...

29:37.651 --> 29:40.194
This is what I get
for eating salad.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.453
Suction.

29:48.579 --> 29:49.704
Suction.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.205
Aspirator.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.424
Your turn.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.719
Irrigation.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.054
Sponge.

30:07.181 --> 30:08.473
What did you do?

30:08.599 --> 30:09.599
Nothing. Why, what's wrong?

30:09.725 --> 30:11.809
I can't see.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.269
Vision's blurry
or you've lost...

30:13.395 --> 30:15.062
I didn't lose it,
you took it from me!

30:15.189 --> 30:16.856
- George, calm down.
- I can't see!

30:16.982 --> 30:18.399
Give me some lorazepam!

30:18.525 --> 30:20.318
- What did you do to me?
- Hold still!

30:20.444 --> 30:21.569
- George! George!
- What's going on?

30:21.695 --> 30:24.614
- No. No. Calm down!
- What did you do to me?

30:26.700 --> 30:29.577
There's no inflammation in
the optic nerve and his retina's intact.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.913
The blindness has to have been caused
by something in his brain.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.081
And not surprisingly
there was no sign of Chagas'

30:34.208 --> 30:36.042
or any other
parasites in his CSF.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.336
So we've ruled out
his parents,

30:38.462 --> 30:40.713
prostitutes, the arugula.
Means either...

30:40.839 --> 30:42.131
I took the sample
from the prefrontal.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.217
I was never anywhere
near his visual cortex.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.928
Or you missed a tumor
on the MRI.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.930
Not a chance,
the MRI was clean.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.806
- You mind?
- Where are you going?

30:50.933 --> 30:52.558
To get a $400 butt plug.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.601
What about George?

30:53.727 --> 30:56.103
He's gonna have to
get his own. Come on.

30:56.230 --> 30:57.563
Let's see if we can
get this thing figured out

30:57.689 --> 30:59.440
by the time
we get to the elevator.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.816
It could be MS.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.652
Would explain the coma,
the blindness,

31:02.778 --> 31:03.945
loss of balance,
and the fever.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.947
Could also explain
his lack of concern for his health.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.490
MS can cause
excessive cheerfulness.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.116
Yeah, he's a delight.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.327
You don't get to MS
with coma as the first symptom.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.997
Blindness plus coma
says diabetes. Just in time.

31:15.123 --> 31:18.000
No. Blood sugar, urine dip stick
and hemoglobin A1c are normal.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.710
Were normal when you tested.

31:19.836 --> 31:20.836
He's been
in and out of a coma,

31:20.963 --> 31:22.547
whatever's going on
is waxing and waning,

31:22.673 --> 31:24.507
unlike his pants size,
which only waxes.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.176
Which also points to diabetes.
Test him again.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.679
And this time add
a glucose tolerance test and an HEC.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.389
We already have
a CSF sample,

31:31.515 --> 31:34.058
we might as well check it for proteins
to rule out MS first.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.519
Agreed. Except for the part
about doing it first.

31:36.645 --> 31:37.687
Where are you going?

31:37.813 --> 31:40.273
The butt plug was my way of saying,
"Mind your own business."

31:40.399 --> 31:42.441
Apparently too subtle.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.278
George, all it is
is sugar water, I promise.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.030
Just because I'm overweight
doesn't make me diabetic!

31:48.156 --> 31:50.199
You tested me,
everybody's tested me.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.076
Sometimes the blood sugar levels
can fluctuate,

31:52.202 --> 31:53.369
make it difficult
to diagnose.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.789
You stuck a needle in my brain
and 10 seconds later I was blind!

31:56.915 --> 31:58.833
How is that difficult
to diagnose?

31:58.959 --> 32:01.252
Who the hell knows
what else you guys done to me?

32:01.378 --> 32:03.087
- I should have never come here!
- You didn't come here,

32:03.213 --> 32:06.048
you were brought here because you were
in a coma and barely alive.

32:06.174 --> 32:09.510
We didn't do that to you,
you need to let us figure out what did.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.848
For someone who insists
he enjoys life as much as you do,

32:13.974 --> 32:15.850
you certainly don't seem willing
to do much to prolong it.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.351
Yeah,

32:17.477 --> 32:22.023
because I don't agree with the brilliant
doctors, suddenly I'm suicidal!

32:22.149 --> 32:24.442
Refusing to cooperate with us
does not make you suicidal,

32:24.568 --> 32:25.693
it makes you an idiot.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.321
You think
we want to see you blind or in a coma?

32:31.867 --> 32:33.451
I've been fat all my life.

32:34.578 --> 32:37.663
I've only been sick
for the past few days.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.293
You look for a disease
that has nothing to do with my size,

32:42.419 --> 32:43.919
and I will help you.

32:45.589 --> 32:49.050
Otherwise, leave me alone.

32:52.095 --> 32:57.350
Speeding, DUI,
reckless driving,

32:57.476 --> 33:01.354
resisting arrest,
possession of a class three narcotic.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.480
And now it looks like
they've added

33:02.606 --> 33:06.359
another possession with intent
to traffic charge as well.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.487
They found some pills
at your house.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.781
All of which
I had a prescription for.

33:11.907 --> 33:12.823
That's a lot of pills.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.825
I'm in a lot of pain.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.287
This is all because some cop
came into the clinic,

33:18.413 --> 33:21.207
I was rude to him,
this is his way of getting back at me.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.208
You've made it pretty easy.

33:22.334 --> 33:27.129
His insane reaction to a simple
rectal thermometer reading

33:27.255 --> 33:30.841
probably says a lot more
about his mother than it says about me.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.637
I'm inclined to think
your particular charm

33:35.555 --> 33:39.141
may not be immediately
appreciated by a jury.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.018
I'm not interested
in a plea bargain.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.521
It's your best bet
to make this go away.

33:43.647 --> 33:46.315
There is no this.
There's a him.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.235
The only thing I'm guilty of
is humiliating a bully.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.821
I wasn't speeding,
I wasn't impaired, I didn't resist,

33:51.947 --> 33:53.781
and I certainly was not
distributing narcotics

33:53.907 --> 33:54.907
to anyone but myself,

33:55.033 --> 33:57.159
because I need
those narcotics.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.412
Five grand retainer.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.915
If we end up going to trial, there'll
be another 30 due before the first day.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.001
My hourly is 450.
That work for you?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.717
What'd your lawyer say?

34:13.468 --> 34:16.095
I looked up butt plug
in a legal dictionary. What'd he say?

34:16.221 --> 34:18.639
That a smile like mine
can't lose.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.266
What did the tests say?

34:20.392 --> 34:23.436
You were right about MS.
No myelin basic proteins in his CSF.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.812
- What about diabetes?
- Don't know.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.021
He says
we only think it's diabetes

34:26.148 --> 34:29.024
because of his weight,
won't let us test him.

34:43.832 --> 34:47.334
So, you would rather be a blind invalid
than admit the fact

34:47.461 --> 34:50.171
that maybe you might have
a little problem with overeating.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.338
By a little problem,
of course,

34:51.465 --> 34:53.132
I mean you've eaten yourself
half to death.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.593
And you would rather let me die
than consider the fact

34:55.719 --> 34:58.929
that whatever is wrong with me
has nothing to do with my weight.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.390
I go where the symptoms
tell me to go.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.476
And right now
they're asking why this stuff

35:03.602 --> 35:05.519
is the first thing
you've ever refused to swallow.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.688
I am not diabetic.

35:07.814 --> 35:11.609
Grocery stores giving away medical
degrees with the free turkeys now?

35:11.735 --> 35:13.527
The sooner you drink this,
the sooner I get to go waste my time

35:13.653 --> 35:14.570
with something else.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.322
Get the hell off of me!

35:16.448 --> 35:19.033
No dessert
till you've finished your dinner!

35:20.577 --> 35:22.036
George, just drink it!

35:22.162 --> 35:23.162
Nurse!

35:23.288 --> 35:25.998
Get this jackass off of me!

35:26.124 --> 35:27.708
What the hell is going on?

35:27.834 --> 35:29.126
Just trying to force
a horse to...

35:31.338 --> 35:32.546
Let go!

35:54.152 --> 35:55.694
What's going on?

35:55.821 --> 35:59.615
Get X-rays of his hands.
Then bronc him, do a sputum cytology

35:59.741 --> 36:02.159
and check his CSF
for anti-hu antibodies.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.202
How are we gonna get him
to do all that,

36:03.328 --> 36:04.995
we can't even get him to drink
a bottle of sugar water?

36:05.121 --> 36:07.581
Tell him that lung cancer
is in no way connected to obesity.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.000
You don't think
he'll realize we're lying?

36:10.126 --> 36:12.461
You're not. Lung cancer's
got nothing to do with obesity.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.129
I meant about him
having lung cancer.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.465
You didn't notice
his fingers?

36:16.591 --> 36:17.675
I noticed they were fat.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.134
You should have
pissed him off,

36:19.261 --> 36:20.094
he would have grabbed you.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.262
Then you would have
felt the bones,

36:21.388 --> 36:24.181
they're not just fat,
they're clubbed.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.549
George,

37:00.510 --> 37:01.427
it's me.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.017
Your tests were positive.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.146
You have a small cell
lung carcinoma.

37:12.272 --> 37:14.481
It caused a paraneoplastic
neurologic syndrome,

37:14.608 --> 37:17.443
which in turn
caused your blindness and coma.

37:17.819 --> 37:20.487
The cancer's metastasized
to your lymph nodes.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.240
It's inoperable,

37:23.366 --> 37:26.118
but there are
radiation treatments available.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.457
They might give you
a few more months.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.046
I never smoked.

37:51.061 --> 37:52.394
C'est la vie.

38:29.349 --> 38:30.724
You were right.

38:32.686 --> 38:35.020
- So was he.
- He said, "C'est la vie."

38:35.146 --> 38:36.605
He's a complicated man.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.856
What about you?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.526
What are you gonna do
about your problem?

38:40.652 --> 38:42.444
Nothing. Just got a call
from my lawyer.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.905
He gave the DA copies
of my prescriptions.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.573
Soon as they confirm
they're bona fides,

38:46.700 --> 38:49.451
they're gonna drop the possession,
DUI and resisting arrest.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.745
Soon as I pay
my $85 speeding ticket

38:51.871 --> 38:53.455
and the impound fine,
I get my bike back.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.707
I guess that's good.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.709
- You guess?
- No, it's good.

38:59.129 --> 39:01.672
You get to keep going
like you always have.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.385
All right, I give up.
Who was it?

39:06.511 --> 39:08.345
Who in your family
had the weight problem?

39:08.471 --> 39:09.930
You think I can only care
about a patient

39:10.056 --> 39:11.890
if I know someone else
who's been through the same thing?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.308
You care for everybody.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.602
You only lie
and stand up to Cuddy for a few.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.855
You lie for everybody
and only care about a few.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.523
You're avoiding the question.

39:19.649 --> 39:21.942
I like damaged people,
remember?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.319
It explains everything I do.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.696
Almost everything.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.950
It wasn't you, was it?

39:30.910 --> 39:33.203
- Does it matter?
- Nope, but it'd be interesting.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.371
Sorry to disappoint you,

39:34.497 --> 39:37.624
but sometimes the answers
just aren't that simple.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.631
I know he can be a real ass,

39:44.758 --> 39:47.092
and he has no problem lying
when it serves him,

39:47.218 --> 39:48.802
but he's not lying
about the pain.

39:48.928 --> 39:52.222
He needs the medication,
which is why I prescribed it.

39:52.348 --> 39:53.182
All of it.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.518
Well, I see a lot of cases

39:57.937 --> 40:01.774
where people who have
real injuries end up getting addicted.

40:03.318 --> 40:08.322
And then, well, things kind of
spiral out of control.

40:08.448 --> 40:11.241
And lives get ruined,
and not just their own.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.539
I don't know what else
to tell you.

40:28.593 --> 40:29.593
What about these?

40:29.719 --> 40:31.470
This is getting...

40:31.596 --> 40:33.847
If it's got my name on it,
it's a legit scrip.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.516
- You sure?
- Yeah.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.185
Because the signatures
on these

40:38.311 --> 40:41.688
look a little different
than the signatures on those.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.323
You look surprised.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.075
No, I'm just...

40:54.244 --> 40:58.705
I hadn't thought about it.
I do sign my name differently sometimes.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.587
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.798
I just, I guess get bored
signing it the same way.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.759
You know what they say
about doctors' handwriting.

41:11.094 --> 41:14.429
I'm gonna give you a moment

41:15.723 --> 41:18.934
to reconsider that answer.

41:19.102 --> 41:23.522
Because if you are,
for some reason, mistaken,

41:26.109 --> 41:30.279
we will find out,
and that will not be good for you.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.906
Or Dr. House.

41:34.742 --> 41:36.785
I am sure. Absolutely.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.166
All right.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.170
I guess that's it, then.

41:57.015 --> 41:57.973
Thank you for your help.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.683
Okay, no problem.
