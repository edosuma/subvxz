'London in the 1960s.

00:54.708 --> 00:57.124
'Everyone had a story about the Krays.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.874
'You could walk into any pub
to hear a lie or two about them.

01:01.541 --> 01:04.915
'But I was there
and I'm not careless with the truth.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.625
'They were brothers,
but bound by more than blood.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.665
'They were twins as well, counterparts.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.832
'Gangster princes
of the city they meant to conquer.

01:17.291 --> 01:20.458
'Ron Kray was a one-man London mob.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.790
'Bloodthirsty, illogical
and funny as well.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.915
'My Reggie was different.

01:27.041 --> 01:30.790
'Once in a lifetime do you find
a street-fighting man like Reg.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.874
'Believe me when I say

01:33.000 --> 01:35.707
'it took a lot of love
for me to hate him the way I do.'

01:47.833 --> 01:50.290
- Morning, Albie.
- Morning, son.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.790
- Is that tea for two?
- All right, Albie?

01:59.666 --> 02:01.374
Hello, boys.

02:01.958 --> 02:05.290
How you doing? You all right?
Got you a cup of tea here. You fancy it?

02:05.416 --> 02:07.249
Yeah? No?

02:08.125 --> 02:10.207
What's this?
The old Dagenham Anglia?

02:10.333 --> 02:13.374
Naught to 60 in, what, 40 minutes,
something like that?

02:14.166 --> 02:19.415
Phwoar! It's a bit of you, that, innit,
all black and cramped and very sharp.

02:19.541 --> 02:22.040
This one's really milky, for you.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.749
Why don't you fuck off, Kray?

02:23.875 --> 02:26.457
All right, I will. You know,
I wouldn't want to keep you,

02:26.583 --> 02:30.665
what with all them rapists and murderers
you gotta lock away, eh, Nipper?

02:30.791 --> 02:33.499
Where do you take a turd in there?

02:33.625 --> 02:35.957
I suppose you just hold it in, don't you?

02:38.958 --> 02:42.415
All right, then, have a lovely day.
Cheer up. It's nearly Christmas.

02:42.541 --> 02:43.999
Sorry about that.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.707
Where's me driver?
Where's Frank?

02:46.833 --> 02:49.540
- Can't get out of bed in the morning, Reg.
- You what?

02:49.666 --> 02:52.415
He ain't here. He ain't showed up.
His heart ain't in it.

02:52.541 --> 02:54.915
All right, OK.
Well, let's go get him, then, shall we?

02:55.041 --> 02:58.040
- Where is he? On Ormsby Street, yeah?
- Yeah. Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.874
Nah, you're all right. I'm gonna walk.
It's a lovely day for it.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.290
Don't forget this lot.
They're very important.

03:04.416 --> 03:05.957
I won't.

03:06.732 --> 03:07.983
Come on.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.582
I shall walk incredibly slowly.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.624
- All right, Vera?
- All right, Reg?

03:16.750 --> 03:18.207
- How you doing? You good?
- Yeah.

03:18.333 --> 03:19.665
Lovely.

03:20.541 --> 03:21.582
Rita.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.457
I was going to knock on your door.
Me mum said you left that in the kitchen.

03:25.583 --> 03:26.832
- Oh, I did.
- That yours?

03:26.958 --> 03:30.332
- It is. Oh, thanks ever so much.
- Not a problem. You're welcome.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.790
Isn't he sweet?

03:33.333 --> 03:34.915
East Enders.

03:36.166 --> 03:40.249
They won't talk to a policeman,
but they'll kiss a gangster. Eh?

03:41.833 --> 03:44.207
The filthy cockney bastards.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.915
How about we clean your car for you?

03:59.583 --> 04:02.374
You get the bumper
and I'll get the lights.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.207
Frank about?

04:09.708 --> 04:10.999
Frank!

04:13.916 --> 04:14.999
Who are you?

04:15.750 --> 04:18.165
Frances. Frank's sister.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.874
Hang about, I recognise you.
See, I recognise you.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.749
You was a little bit younger then.
You got all grown up, didn't you?

04:24.875 --> 04:26.124
It happens.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.457
What have you got there?

04:31.583 --> 04:32.915
A sweet.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.457
That's not any sweet, is it?
That's a lemon sherbet, that is.

04:35.583 --> 04:36.665
Mind if I have a crack?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.124
All right.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.207
Thank you.

04:42.708 --> 04:44.457
Oh, that's nice, innit?

04:46.541 --> 04:49.499
- You're not supposed to chew it.
- No?

04:51.583 --> 04:53.499
How else am I supposed to get
to the sherbetty bit?

04:54.875 --> 04:57.749
- By being patient.
- Nah!

04:57.875 --> 05:00.624
Being patient doesn't get you
what you want, does it?

05:03.208 --> 05:05.624
Half a minute, Reg. Right down.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.582
- Is he in trouble?
- Yeah, he is.

05:09.666 --> 05:13.499
Will you go out with me?
I'll go easy on him if you do.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.999
All right.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.999
But not for that reason.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.457
Saturday night.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.165
Who are you talking to?
You're half-dressed,

05:24.291 --> 05:26.499
talking to a man in the door.
What's wrong with you, Frances?

05:26.625 --> 05:28.499
Get back in the kitchen,
finish them dishes.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.332
Hey, this is yours.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.207
Thank you.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.957
Oversleep again, Frank, all right,

05:47.083 --> 05:49.874
and it's back to the cheese shop
or the fish shop

05:50.000 --> 05:51.957
or whatever shop it was you come from.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.499
Print.

05:53.625 --> 05:54.874
Print shop.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.624
Oh, yeah?

05:56.750 --> 05:59.415
You'll be back to the fucking shit shop,
you understand?

05:59.541 --> 06:02.415
- Yeah.
- What does your sister do?

06:03.833 --> 06:07.249
She goes to one of those, uh,
Pitman Colleges.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.249
You know, typing, shorthand.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.415
- Yeah?
- Yep.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.332
She's got a bit of class, mate.
She's very elegant.

06:14.458 --> 06:15.749
Where you been hiding her?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.582
She been away.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.540
She's a bit, uh, fragile, Reg.

06:20.666 --> 06:23.207
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.332
- All right.
- Stop here, Frank.

06:34.541 --> 06:37.624
Five minutes. Won't be long.

06:40.916 --> 06:43.749
How long you reckon it'll take
for him to twig, Albie?

06:43.875 --> 06:46.165
Little bit of cat and mouse.

06:51.333 --> 06:54.415
'Nipper Read was the copper
on the Krays' case.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.832
'And he made his presence known.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.874
'He was heavy-footed, as they say.'

07:12.750 --> 07:16.415
And I'm staring at the back
of this geezer's head.

07:16.541 --> 07:20.249
The whole time I'm thinking, you know,

07:21.208 --> 07:25.124
"Give Ron Kray your sausage.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.499
"Give Ron

07:33.375 --> 07:35.749
"your fucking sausage."

07:38.291 --> 07:39.957
You know?

07:41.625 --> 07:44.540
I was drilling my eyes
into the back of his head.

07:45.958 --> 07:50.790
Till I'm not even thinking it anymore.
I'm not... I'm not even thinking.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.624
I'm broadcasting it.

07:55.750 --> 07:59.082
Until he turns around
and you know what he says? He says...

08:00.125 --> 08:04.457
"Hey, Ron, do you fancy my sausage?
I've got... I've got no appetite for it."

08:05.791 --> 08:07.415
Interesting.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.915
'When my future brother-in-law
said "interesting"...'

08:10.041 --> 08:11.082
Ain't it?

08:11.208 --> 08:15.707
'...it meant he had no fucking idea what he
or you or anyone else was talking about.'

08:15.833 --> 08:17.582
Fascinating, Ron.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.790
Fascinating.

08:21.916 --> 08:24.374
'Ron had been sentenced
to three years in prison

08:24.500 --> 08:26.665
'for grievous bodily harm.

08:26.791 --> 08:28.999
'Near the end of his sentence,
he was certified insane

08:29.125 --> 08:31.540
'and remanded to a mental hospital.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.999
'What was wanting
was a friendly psychiatrist.'

08:34.125 --> 08:35.164
What's that?

08:35.291 --> 08:39.499
When you say
you want to "raspberry" this man,

08:39.625 --> 08:42.664
I'm not sure of your vernacular.
What do you mean?

08:42.791 --> 08:45.332
Raspberry ripple, cripple.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.249
You want to cripple someone?

08:47.375 --> 08:50.207
- Yep, that's right.
- And why is that?

08:51.125 --> 08:55.499
Because, Doctor,
I'm afraid he may not be inclined

08:55.625 --> 08:58.999
to provide a favourable evaluation
of my employer.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.499
And who's your employer?

09:02.416 --> 09:03.874
Ronnie Kray.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.249
Is there hope, Doctor?

09:10.458 --> 09:11.707
Excuse me a moment.

09:14.083 --> 09:16.332
Take your time.

09:17.041 --> 09:20.707
Ronald Kray possesses
possibly the soundest mind I've seen

09:20.833 --> 09:24.207
in 26 years of psychiatric practice.

09:24.333 --> 09:28.832
In my view, to keep him here
would be a waste of public resources.

09:35.458 --> 09:38.749
A lifetime's integrity down the toilet.

09:38.875 --> 09:42.957
'The Queen would survive,
but God save the rest of us.'

09:48.041 --> 09:49.957
Mr Kray.

09:51.666 --> 09:52.999
I hope you know what you're doing.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.249
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
I'm going back to London, gonna take the...

09:56.375 --> 09:59.332
Your brother has no real idea
who or what he is.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.957
Nor does he trust his own senses.

10:01.083 --> 10:04.457
I've never seen a man
so desperately in need of reassurance.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.124
We all like a nice little compliment
now and again, don't we?

10:07.250 --> 10:09.457
Your brother is arbitrary,
violent and psychopathic,

10:09.583 --> 10:11.790
probably paranoid schizophrenic.

10:13.791 --> 10:17.624
What I'm trying to tell you
is that he's off his fucking rocker.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.249
It's called Stemetil.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.374
You need to give it to your brother
twice a day

10:21.500 --> 10:23.832
or there's going to be serious trouble.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.915
Oi, Frances, the car's outside.

10:42.166 --> 10:44.040
Oh!

10:44.166 --> 10:47.790
You've got glamour, Frances.
You're like an East End starlet.

10:47.916 --> 10:49.499
East End harlot's more like it.

10:49.625 --> 10:52.332
They're trousers, Mum.
She doesn't look like a harlot.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.249
What she's wearing doesn't matter.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.499
When people see her with Reggie Kray,
they'll think she's a tart.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.082
Why would you say that?

10:59.208 --> 11:02.624
He's a gangster, Frances.
The Krays are gangsters.

11:03.666 --> 11:06.499
- Well, I think he's sweet.
- Oh, God!

11:06.625 --> 11:09.749
And I'm going to kiss him.
Do you hear me?

11:15.291 --> 11:17.040
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.790
You look lovely.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.290
So do you.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.665
Hello. This is Big Pat.

11:41.791 --> 11:43.374
- Hello, Big Pat.
- Reggie.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.832
- How you doing? You all right, mate?
- Miss. Nice to see you.

11:45.958 --> 11:47.957
Big Pat's here to keep riff-raff out.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.790
Always.

11:49.916 --> 11:52.339
So how come you're
letting us in, then, mate?

11:52.465 --> 11:53.499
Have a good night.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.249
- Thank you.
- Thanks, mate. Cheers.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.499
Oh, hello, here's trouble.
Hold the phone.

11:57.625 --> 12:01.040
- Oi, you. How you doing, big man?
- You all right, boss?

12:01.166 --> 12:02.624
- Are you well?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.999
- You behaving yourself?
- Always. I'm a teddy bear, me.

12:05.125 --> 12:08.165
Go easy. If he gives you any trouble,
come and speak to me. Come on.

12:08.291 --> 12:11.082
- You all right, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm good. She's good.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.457
- Hello, Reg.
- Hello.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.832
- Reg, you all right?
- Mr Kray.

12:14.958 --> 12:17.999
- Everyone here knows you.
- Yeah, well, I own it, it's my club.

12:18.125 --> 12:20.790
- You mean it's your local?
- No, I own the place. It's mine.

12:20.916 --> 12:23.040
I've been by here 10 times,
I never knew it was yours.

12:23.166 --> 12:26.749
Well, you can get away with a lot in life
if you keep your mouth shut.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.749
Ooh, that's Teddy.
Hang on a second.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.082
How you doing? You all right?
Good to see you. You good?

12:31.208 --> 12:33.749
How's the family? Excellent.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.624
- What?
- Those men look frightening.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.165
No, no, they're just East End boxers.
They're lovely.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.540
I let 'em drink in here for free,
you know.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.665
Reggie, that's Joan Collins.

12:43.791 --> 12:45.040
Yeah, might be, yeah.

12:45.166 --> 12:47.624
We had that Barbara Windsor in here
the other night.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.582
- Really?
- She comes in quite a bit, actually.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.040
She loves it.
And, uh, that's my formula.

12:52.166 --> 12:56.249
What I like to do is I like to mix celebrities
with a few, just a few, East End villains.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.749
The punters, they love it.
It's really good for business.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.999
Would you like a seat?

13:01.125 --> 13:03.290
Excuse me, Reg.
Have you, uh, got a moment?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.332
No, I don't, actually.
I'm busy. All right?

13:05.458 --> 13:08.665
- Nah, it's important, Reg.
- This is important as well, so...

13:08.791 --> 13:11.124
- Reg.
- All right.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.249
Frances, would you mind if I, um...

13:13.375 --> 13:15.332
if I take care of some business
just for a moment?

13:15.458 --> 13:17.999
- No, of course not.
- Excuse me. Be back in a minute.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.874
You sit with her. What is it?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.457
- It's back here.
- What?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.499
- Hello, Reg.
- All right, mate?

13:23.625 --> 13:26.582
In fact, if you don't know,
you don't fucking know.

13:26.708 --> 13:29.290
- You know what I mean?
- Reggie.

13:31.833 --> 13:34.082
How are you, Reg?

13:34.208 --> 13:36.624
I'm all right. I can't complain.
Who'd fucking listen?

13:36.750 --> 13:39.624
- What's the palaver? Go on.
- Sit down, Reg. Sit down, please.

13:39.750 --> 13:40.790
All right.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.915
You had a question about our take
in the purple heart business. Pill game.

13:44.041 --> 13:46.374
- Go on.
- Jack here would like to explain himself.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.540
Go on.

13:47.666 --> 13:50.582
Go on, Jack.
Tell Reggie what you told me.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.665
Well, Reg...

13:53.791 --> 13:56.499
- Yeah?
- I, uh...

13:56.625 --> 14:00.832
The thing is, under normal
circumstances, my accounts...

14:01.958 --> 14:05.790
Are you going to take all fucking night,
mate? 'Cause I've got things to do.

14:05.916 --> 14:08.707
Tell him, Jack. Go on, spit it out.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.707
- I borrowed a few quid off the top.
- Right. All right.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.207
- I sold a few pills on the side.
- Yeah, there's a surprise.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.165
Things have been a bit tight at home

14:16.291 --> 14:18.082
and I was just trying
to keep the wife happy.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.332
Trying to keep the wife happy.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.624
Is this why you brought me in here,
for this? This nonsense?

14:22.750 --> 14:25.290
- It's important business, Reg.
- It's important, is it? Yeah?

14:25.416 --> 14:28.082
- You should know about this.
- All right, let's deal with this business.

14:28.208 --> 14:32.165
Tomorrow, you come back to work,
and you pay back every fucking penny.

14:32.291 --> 14:35.415
- I was going to suggest that.
- Good. Right. Are we done?

14:35.541 --> 14:37.499
Everybody happy?

14:37.625 --> 14:39.832
All right, then, can I get back
to my fucking evening?

14:39.958 --> 14:42.832
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Albie. Cheers.

14:42.958 --> 14:45.624
- Sorry for wasting your time, Jack.
- Thanks.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.874
Thanks for coming in.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.832
Here you go, mate.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.624
Good?

14:54.500 --> 14:57.624
You fucking little thieving cunt.
You understand?

14:57.750 --> 14:59.915
I heard me. Yeah?

15:00.041 --> 15:03.040
Next time I'll finish you off,
you little slag.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.249
- Get him out of here. Fuck him off.
- Fuck!

15:05.375 --> 15:07.374
You fucking what?
What did you say?

15:07.500 --> 15:10.165
Don't you swear in my club.
Get him out of here right now.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.790
Don't swear in my club. Wanker.

15:12.916 --> 15:15.582
- Listen, there's something else.
- No, there isn't something else,

15:15.708 --> 15:18.040
'cause I've got a young lady in here
and I'm entertaining.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.249
- Have a look at that. See that there?
- I see it.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.915
I'm entertaining, all right?
So I'm gonna have an evening to myself.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.624
- This is important business.
- Can't be. My business, innit?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.999
It's my business. I would know.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.832
Night, Albie.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.582
Hello.
Did I miss anything important?

15:35.708 --> 15:39.165
- No, just me.
- Now, that is important.

15:39.291 --> 15:41.415
- Is it?
- Very important.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.499
Thank you.

15:43.625 --> 15:45.149
Thank you.

15:48.083 --> 15:53.249
So, um... your brother, he was telling me
that you, uh... you're going to college

15:53.375 --> 15:57.082
to... to study to be a secretary.
Is that right?

15:57.208 --> 15:59.457
Yeah, anything to get out of the East End.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.082
What's so bad about the East End?

16:02.208 --> 16:06.290
I've just got bigger dreams than pushing
a pram or haggling with the butcher.

16:06.416 --> 16:07.707
Hmm.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.499
I just don't quite know what they are yet.

16:10.625 --> 16:13.415
Well, the East End's not that bad.

16:13.541 --> 16:16.332
The centre of the earth
can be anywhere you like.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.124
- Even here?
- Yeah, even here.

16:18.250 --> 16:21.540
- In Bethnal Green?
- Yeah, Bethnal Green.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.207
Do you like being a gangster?

16:32.041 --> 16:34.582
I'm not a gangster.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.165
I'm a club owner.

16:40.125 --> 16:44.332
I like the money and I like the respect
of being a club owner.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.999
But I'm not a gangster.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.249
I could have been a boxer,

16:50.375 --> 16:52.749
but then, you know... hello, mate...

16:52.875 --> 16:54.749
I'd end up looking like
some sort of potato.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.957
And I wouldn't even know
what day of the week it was.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.665
This way, at least I know
who I am, you know?

17:00.791 --> 17:04.832
More so, I like the fact that
I've made a little something of myself.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.082
I don't owe the world anything.

17:08.415 --> 17:10.790
So long as the world agrees with you.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.499
I think the world will be all right.

17:25.275 --> 17:27.249
'We shall fight on the beaches.

17:27.375 --> 17:29.874
'We shall fight on the landing grounds.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.332
'We shall fight in the fields...'

17:32.458 --> 17:33.915
'...and in the streets.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.332
'We shall fight in the hills.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.582
'We shall never surrender, and if...'

17:39.708 --> 17:41.624
Hey, Ronnie!

17:41.750 --> 17:43.749
Ronnie, come on out.
You've got visitors, mate.

17:47.250 --> 17:49.999
Watch your step. It's a bit wet.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.207
- You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:53.958 --> 17:56.582
- You must be Frances.
- Hello.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.874
Huh?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.874
Hello, Frances. Hello.
Welcome to the family.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.665
Well, it's a bit premature, that, is it?

18:07.250 --> 18:10.665
- You don't have a beer that I could have?
- Yeah, of course I do. Help yourself.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.624
Don't mind if I have a beer, do you?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.874
I'll let you get to know each other.

18:16.583 --> 18:18.332
Want a cup of tea?
I just put the kettle on.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.624
Take a seat. Go on.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.874
Sit down anywhere you like.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.999
Needs a bit of warming up. So...

18:29.083 --> 18:31.040
What do you think?

18:31.166 --> 18:33.624
Do you think that we look alike,
me and Reggie?

18:33.750 --> 18:35.082
Oh, yes, certainly.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.540
No, you don't.
You think that he's beautiful

18:37.666 --> 18:39.499
and I've got a face like a gorilla's arse.

18:40.724 --> 18:42.374
It's all right, don't worry about it.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.332
- No. I wouldn't say that.
- I'm used to it.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.999
Stop doing your hair, right?
Get me stuff out of the car.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.540
Do something fucking useful.

18:51.583 --> 18:53.499
Yeah, go on, then.

18:58.708 --> 19:01.540
I'm homosexual, Frances.

19:04.291 --> 19:08.332
Well, I am a, uh... I'm a giver, right?
I'm not a receiver.

19:08.458 --> 19:11.082
There is a difference. I'm not a faggot.

19:12.666 --> 19:15.290
But I do believe that, you know,
you should not hide what you are.

19:15.416 --> 19:19.582
You shouldn't hide what you are
'cause it'll make you very sad, you know?

19:19.708 --> 19:22.457
It'll make you very sad.
It'll make you very unwell.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.499
- I agree completely.
- Mmm.

19:25.625 --> 19:29.624
You know, me and my brother,
we're going to rule London.

19:33.041 --> 19:36.915
'The Krays' main rivals
were the Richardsons of South London.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.790
'They were called the Torture Gang.'

19:38.916 --> 19:42.165
For the benefit of the jury,

19:42.291 --> 19:46.374
on whose behalf were you operating
on this side of the river?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.249
Come on, Charlie, please.
I'm begging you.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.332
No, no, no. You do business
with the court as an entity,

19:51.458 --> 19:53.790
- therefore, address the court.
- What?

19:53.916 --> 19:56.207
- What? "Your Honour"!
- Fuck!

19:56.333 --> 19:57.582
You say "Your Honour".

19:57.708 --> 20:00.332
By saying "Your Honour",
you gain the court's attention

20:00.458 --> 20:03.540
and open up a channel
of communication, a conduit.

20:03.666 --> 20:05.582
So, we'll try again.

20:05.708 --> 20:07.999
For the benefit of the jury,

20:08.125 --> 20:11.082
on whose behalf were you working
on this side of the river?

20:11.208 --> 20:13.915
- Please, Charlie! I fucking beg of you!
- Order!

20:14.041 --> 20:16.124
Order in this, my court!

20:17.629 --> 20:19.317
Fuck!

20:20.833 --> 20:23.874
You're in Indian country, old son.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.124
That's what them cockneys
call south of the river, innit?

20:28.583 --> 20:30.040
Indian country.

20:31.250 --> 20:35.999
Well, what are you doing
on my reservation without my say-so,

20:36.125 --> 20:39.290
filling up your canteen
from my fucking watering hole?

20:39.416 --> 20:42.624
You ain't got the bottle to do that
on your own, son. Who do you work for?

20:42.750 --> 20:44.790
I don't know what you're on about, Charlie.
I don't know what you're on about.

20:44.916 --> 20:48.207
- Say their names. Say it!
- Fuck.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.665
- Buzz him.
- Uh, objection, Your Honour.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.665
My client is an upstanding citizen.

20:52.791 --> 20:55.040
Objection overruled
on the grounds it's boring.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.249
Oh, well, fuck him.

20:58.416 --> 21:02.249
- Say it. Say "the Krays", you daft cunt.
- Fuck it!

21:02.375 --> 21:04.790
No, no.
No leading the witness, Eddie.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.790
Fuck off!

21:35.291 --> 21:37.790
Alexander might have been great,
but he wasn't a Greek.

21:38.958 --> 21:41.790
- No?
- No. He was a Macedonian.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.874
But he loved them, though,
Aristotle and that lot.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.582
He was deeply impressed
by them flash Hellenistic cunts.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.207
Christos, get us some more
of that awful retsina.

22:02.208 --> 22:05.624
Charlie, we've got to fucking sort this.

22:05.750 --> 22:09.582
You're absolutely right.
Christos, where's my retsina?

22:09.708 --> 22:13.415
'The Richardsons sent
George Cornell to call for a truce.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.707
'All they were saying
was give peace a chance.'

22:15.833 --> 22:18.915
- Fucking Frank'll win.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck!

22:19.041 --> 22:22.874
- Are you wearing your bravery jacket?
- We're here to parley.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.332
I will fucking map you up, Southie.

22:25.458 --> 22:28.915
No, no, no. Go on, let him in.
He's only little.

22:29.041 --> 22:31.790
Things have got out of hand.
Charlie wants to meet.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.790
Pig and Whistle. Neutral ground.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.374
Just him, you two and Eddie.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.290
Yep. And how do we know
that we're going to be safe?

22:39.416 --> 22:43.999
Well, that's a little thing
called trust, ain't it?

22:44.125 --> 22:48.665
Trust, eh? You always got one bloke
harping on about trust, don't you?

22:48.791 --> 22:50.582
But then you look
over your shoulder, right,

22:50.708 --> 22:54.040
and you see there's another bloke there,
right, with his Hampton in his hand

22:54.166 --> 22:56.749
and he's preparing to shove his cock
right up your arse.

22:57.541 --> 22:59.457
Well, you wouldn't mind that.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.957
You fat poof.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.374
Whoa, no. No, no, no...

23:11.500 --> 23:13.582
Right, you, get him out of here.
Go on, fuck off.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.749
- One hour. We'll be with you.
- That's it, bye-bye.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.457
Fuck off, George.

23:17.583 --> 23:19.415
There's the door, go on.

23:19.541 --> 23:21.540
- Bye-bye.
- Take that dead fox with you. Go on.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.624
Get out, you prick.

23:24.291 --> 23:25.332
What a fucking liberty.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.540
Big Charlie, please could I have
another egg?

23:29.666 --> 23:30.915
I've eaten this one.

23:31.541 --> 23:32.915
I don't like it, Reggie.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.999
Nah, it's all right.

23:35.125 --> 23:37.540
I know them. I know the pub.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.165
We'll be all right.

23:40.291 --> 23:42.665
You got to clean that fucking toilet, mate.
It stinks.

23:42.791 --> 23:45.499
Mate, I paid a girl to do it.
It's not my fault if she don't.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.124
- What are you having to drink?
- Um...

23:47.250 --> 23:49.249
Forget it. They just walked in.

23:50.041 --> 23:52.415
- Mate, can I get two Guinnesses, please?
- Hang on a second.

23:52.541 --> 23:55.415
I just gotta go down to change the barrel.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.082
Reg. Ron.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.207
The Richardsons were unexpectedly engaged,

24:05.333 --> 24:06.915
so we're going to look after you.

24:07.041 --> 24:10.790
Oh, it's all right. The landlord's gone
to change the barrel for me. Thanks.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.999
You don't mind
if I pull myself a pint, do you?

24:13.125 --> 24:15.457
- What is that?
- What do you think, poof?

24:15.583 --> 24:16.790
It's a fucking tool.

24:16.916 --> 24:20.540
No, it's not. It's a fucking rolling pin.
Who are you, Fanny Cradock?

24:20.666 --> 24:22.915
What are you gonna do with that?
You gonna bake me a cake?

24:23.041 --> 24:25.540
You gonna sing me a song,
watch me blow out me fucking candles?

24:27.333 --> 24:29.832
I come here for a fucking shootout, right?

24:29.958 --> 24:33.540
A proper shootout with some proper men,

24:33.666 --> 24:37.124
like Colonel Custer and Geronimo.
Have you ever heard of 'em? No.

24:37.250 --> 24:40.832
'Cause you were too busy in your pinny
baking fucking fairy cakes, weren't you?

24:41.500 --> 24:45.749
Reg, this lot are fucking nonces, to a man.
They're fucking nonces.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.457
Get out of me fucking way.
Go on, get out. Go on, fuck off.

24:48.583 --> 24:51.082
Call yourself a fucking gangster?

24:51.208 --> 24:54.249
A shootout, right, is a fucking shootout!

24:58.083 --> 24:59.790
Like a Western.

25:02.791 --> 25:05.457
Wankers! Fucking embarrassing.

25:05.583 --> 25:08.874
Waste of my time.
Fucking waste of my time.

25:11.833 --> 25:13.749
Well, your brother's done a runner.

25:13.875 --> 25:17.207
Ah, he's just genuinely disappointed
with you. That's all.

25:18.541 --> 25:21.040
Look at that. Full of iron, that is.

25:21.166 --> 25:24.790
See, it takes a while, that does,
you know, to settle.

25:24.916 --> 25:27.957
Charlie Richardson said we're to knock
the granny out of you, Reg.

25:28.083 --> 25:32.290
Oh, yeah? He did, did he?
That's good of him. All right, listen.

25:32.416 --> 25:34.915
When you see him next,
you tell him from me, yeah,

25:35.041 --> 25:38.624
that I say... fuck Charlie, right?

25:38.750 --> 25:40.582
And fuck his brother, yeah?

25:40.708 --> 25:43.249
And fuck that fat Georgie Cornell
that hangs out with him.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.665
Fuck your face. Yeah, yeah?

25:46.791 --> 25:50.332
And fuck the fucking lot of you as well.
What do you think of that? Eh?

25:50.458 --> 25:52.874
- You like that?
- Mmm.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.957
- You won't mind if I fight back, will you?
- You think you can manage it?

25:56.083 --> 25:59.207
Ah, it's more for me pride, really,
to be honest.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.124
I warn you,
I'm not gonna fight fair, though.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.790
So I brought these.

26:02.916 --> 26:04.374
All right?

26:04.500 --> 26:06.874
Now, before we start,
I got a little joke for you.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.749
You'll love this one.

26:08.875 --> 26:11.165
Paranoid schizophrenic,
he walks into a bar...

26:24.250 --> 26:25.374
Ah!

26:32.583 --> 26:34.124
Yeah.

26:41.583 --> 26:44.082
You fucking... Ooh!

26:47.583 --> 26:49.332
Fuck off!

26:58.625 --> 27:02.165
'They never stood a chance
against my beautiful Reggie.

27:03.791 --> 27:05.540

Scotland Yard had its say as well.'

27:11.333 --> 27:14.457

27:16.416 --> 27:20.207
Goal! Get in there, you cunts.

27:21.709 --> 27:25.124
- Police! Stay where you are!
- Oh, come on, boys. Not tonight.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.499
What do you mean, no goal?

27:26.625 --> 27:28.915
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

27:30.750 --> 27:34.457
- 'It's a goal!'
- It's a goal! It's a fucking goal! It's a goal!

27:39.875 --> 27:42.749
'Charlie Richardson
was sentenced to 25 years

28:06.375 --> 28:10.124
I'm not often intrigued,
but your message...

28:10.250 --> 28:12.540
- It intrigued.
- Hmm.

28:12.666 --> 28:14.290
Sit down.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.165
These are the Kray twins.

28:19.041 --> 28:21.290
Ronald and Reginald.

28:24.291 --> 28:26.624
Yes, I've, um, heard of them.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.999
You'll find them useful friends.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.207
What's this about, Mr Payne?

28:31.333 --> 28:36.124
This is about a gambling casino in
Knightsbridge called Esmeralda's Barn.

28:36.250 --> 28:37.832
- I'm not familiar with it.
- Really?

28:37.958 --> 28:39.624
Well, you'll be shocked to learn

28:39.750 --> 28:44.207
that you earned £24,000 from it
in the last three months.

28:44.333 --> 28:47.082
My friends and I would like
to purchase it from you.

28:47.208 --> 28:49.499
We have the contracts ready
for your signature.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.040
'Ruling London involved
intelligence and intimidation.'

28:56.166 --> 28:57.624
It's not for sale.

28:59.333 --> 29:03.540
You might find that in the future,
there is a less polite approach.

29:03.666 --> 29:06.915
'The trick was to cultivate
a quiet certainty

29:07.041 --> 29:09.165
'that should it be needed,
violence was on offer...'

29:09.291 --> 29:10.332
Yeah.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.082
'...and would be happily applied.

but Ron was suspicious of him,

'afraid his scams were the opposite

29:24.125 --> 29:26.832
- Consider Las Vegas.
- All right.

29:26.958 --> 29:29.540
It's all legal, all run by the Mafia.

29:29.666 --> 29:31.540

29:31.666 --> 29:33.582
What with Havana gone,
the Mafia is moving in.

29:33.708 --> 29:36.290
Meyer Lansky has already made inquiries.

29:36.416 --> 29:38.790
- Meyer Lansky?
- Yeah.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.749
What, as in the Meyer Lansky?

29:40.875 --> 29:42.374
Meyer Lansky.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.540
Are the Americans gonna try
and muscle in on us?

29:45.666 --> 29:48.874
No. They don't work that way.
They don't want a war, Ron.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.957
- They're businessmen.
- Well, maybe I want a war with them.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.207
Now, look.

29:54.333 --> 29:57.332
What they do want is to know
who is the up-and-coming local firm,

29:57.458 --> 30:00.332
because they will colonise London
by financing that firm,

30:00.458 --> 30:01.957
then franchising the city.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.499
So you have to prove to the Americans
that the Krays are the only game in town.

30:05.625 --> 30:08.499
Yeah, very fucking interesting.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.999
The world could be our oyster.

30:11.125 --> 30:13.374
- Payne.
- What?

30:13.500 --> 30:16.832
You say "our" a lot, right?

30:16.958 --> 30:21.832
You say "our" and you also say "we" a lot.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.624
Do I?

30:24.208 --> 30:27.540
My question is, is your last name Kray?

30:30.333 --> 30:34.374
Listen, Ron, you keep the pearls.
I'm perfectly happy with the soft bits.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.290
Yeah, I bet you are.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.915
I bet you are.

30:39.041 --> 30:44.082
Reggie, I say it's a very bad idea.
It's just a bad idea.

30:44.208 --> 30:48.082
I say, right, that we meet these
Mafioso scum at London Airport, right?

30:48.208 --> 30:50.082
We pick them up, we chop them up,

30:50.208 --> 30:54.082
put them in their fucking luggage
and send them straight home, mate.

30:54.208 --> 30:56.082
That's the plan.

31:05.166 --> 31:08.374
Well, I'm glad we could have this meeting.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.790
Mr Lansky has taken an interest
in the Colony Sporting Club.

31:11.916 --> 31:13.915
He has his casino people there right now.

31:14.041 --> 31:17.624
Well, Mr Lansky might want to know

31:17.750 --> 31:20.832
that we happen to have
a casino of our own.

31:20.958 --> 31:24.290
Really? Your own casino?

31:24.416 --> 31:26.831
Well, you see, we own Las Vegas.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.332
But here,
the Atlantic Ocean is in our way.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.415
So Mr Lansky lacks the ability

31:33.541 --> 31:36.790
to, uh... ensure the physical security
of his property,

31:36.916 --> 31:40.582
from both outside muscle and the cops.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.290
He thinks the Kray family could help.

31:42.416 --> 31:45.749
London is going to be
the Las Vegas of Europe.

31:45.875 --> 31:49.624
We need someone to front
and someone to muscle for us.

31:50.541 --> 31:53.749
Uh... I mean, look,
we can do your security, right,

31:53.875 --> 31:57.540
that's not a problem, you know,
but we don't want to work for you.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.540
I mean, we'd much rather
that we work with you.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.040
What Reggie is trying to say...

32:02.166 --> 32:05.582
I think he knows what he's trying to say.
He just said it.

32:05.708 --> 32:07.707
- We're in your backyard.
- Yeah.

32:07.833 --> 32:10.374
And Mr Lansky is open
to discussions of this nature.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.499
He sends this as a goodwill gesture.

32:12.625 --> 32:16.290
Just a taste. For expenses.
Open it, please.

32:22.583 --> 32:26.874
Now, the second briefcase contains
business of my own I need to take care of.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.540
Please.

32:31.708 --> 32:34.457
Bearer bonds. Free money.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.874
A hundred grand
in negotiable bearer bonds.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.665
Jacked from a bank in Montreal.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.540
Too hot to move in North America.

32:42.666 --> 32:44.290
That's a hundred grand.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.915
Could you guys handle that?

32:48.833 --> 32:50.790
Yeah, we can handle it.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.915
Really? Good.

32:54.041 --> 32:56.124
Boys who jacked it get 20%.

32:56.250 --> 32:59.207
We split the rest 60-40.

32:59.333 --> 33:00.874
If this works out, Reggie,

33:01.000 --> 33:04.624
I got a $2 million backlog
of those scharoles.

33:05.541 --> 33:08.040
Does that sound
like you're staying out of our way?

33:11.791 --> 33:13.832
50-50, mate.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.124
I like you, Reggie.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.082
50-50 it is. Done.

33:24.166 --> 33:25.499
I'm glad we could make a deal.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.790
- Yeah.
- Now, this feels right.

33:27.916 --> 33:30.790
Listen, you come to Philadelphia any time,

33:30.916 --> 33:34.332
you see what you want, any size,
any shape, right? We'll get it for you.

33:34.458 --> 33:37.249
A nice Italian girl.
Little spaghetti and meatballs.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.499
I prefer boys.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.040
Excuse me? I didn't catch that.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.165
I said I prefer boys.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.540
Italians, actually.

33:50.208 --> 33:52.624
Sometimes Greek, but I am not prejudiced.

33:52.750 --> 33:56.874
No. Because I happen
to have had a Negro once

33:57.000 --> 33:59.499
and a Tahitian,
who I bent up like a pretzel.

33:59.625 --> 34:02.082

to admit that, kid.

some fucking set of castagnas on you.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.874
Now, don't spill it.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.499
'Cause you've had a little tumble,
haven't you? Eh?

40:05.625 --> 40:07.457
Here it is.

40:08.912 --> 40:09.957
Good boy.

40:10.083 --> 40:12.290
- Can I have water?
- Here he is, look.

40:12.416 --> 40:15.290
Look at this. Reggie Kray.

40:15.416 --> 40:17.082
Begging fucking water...

40:26.125 --> 40:29.915
Reggie! Reggie! Reggie...

40:44.500 --> 40:45.999
Hello, Frances.

40:46.958 --> 40:49.749
- Hello, Ron.
- I saw Reg today.

40:49.875 --> 40:53.832
He sends his best. He says it's probably
best that you don't go and visit him yet.

40:53.958 --> 40:55.749
Did he say why?

40:55.875 --> 40:57.207
Nah, didn't mention it.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.165
Do you know it is possible, right,

41:02.291 --> 41:05.832
for a person to become a ghost
while they're still alive.

41:06.916 --> 41:08.290
You think so?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.915
Well, it's happened to you, ain't it?

41:18.208 --> 41:19.499
No, no, no. No, look.

41:19.625 --> 41:20.832
- Listen.
- "No" what?

41:20.958 --> 41:23.415
No, no, no. Please, please.
Just for a moment, just listen.

41:23.541 --> 41:27.624
Gambling clubs are legally obliged
to pay winnings on the spot.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.624
And that is why we insist our gamblers
pay their debts on the spot as well.

41:31.750 --> 41:35.499
Yes, I know. I've heard you.
But that's your problem. Right?

41:35.625 --> 41:38.124
That's your problem, not mine.

41:38.250 --> 41:41.040
Mine is that I want £50,000.

41:41.166 --> 41:44.499
Here you go again
with your £50,000 to go to Nigeria.

41:44.625 --> 41:47.624
No, it's not just to go to Nigeria, is it?

41:47.750 --> 41:49.915
I want to set up a company.
All right?

41:50.041 --> 41:54.374
I want to build a city in Nigeria,
for the children.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.499
- Near Enugu.
- Enugu.

41:56.625 --> 41:58.999
- Yes, Enugu.
- Yes, Enugu.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.874
I told you, Enugu! Right?

42:01.000 --> 42:02.790
You don't know everything, do you, Payne?

42:02.916 --> 42:06.124
Did you know that "Enugu"
is the African word for "utopia"?

42:06.250 --> 42:07.707
- No.
- No, you did not.

42:07.833 --> 42:10.999
Did you know that "utopia"
is the Greek word for "nowhere"?

42:11.125 --> 42:14.207
For £50,000, I can make that somewhere.

42:14.333 --> 42:17.249
I can turn it into a place
where people will smile at me

42:17.375 --> 42:20.832
- and children will dance...
- I will smile for you, Ron.

42:20.958 --> 42:25.665
I will smile for you if you tell me
where I can get £50,000.

42:25.791 --> 42:28.582
I'm telling you. I'm fucking telling you.
Just pull it out of the casino.

42:28.708 --> 42:32.415
- I cannot pull it out of the casino...
- Just pull it out of the casino, you cunt.

42:32.541 --> 42:35.249
Do not meddle with a foolproof way
of making the money!

42:35.375 --> 42:37.999
I'm not a fucking banker!

42:38.125 --> 42:40.582
I am not a fucking banker!

42:40.708 --> 42:42.499
- Right? Am I?
- Genius! Look at that.

42:42.625 --> 42:44.290
That has made it all the more manageable.

42:44.416 --> 42:47.165
- This man who wants to build a city!
- Don't you fucking threaten me!

42:47.291 --> 42:50.207
Don't you fucking dare
talk to me like that, you cunt!

42:51.375 --> 42:55.374
Reggie is not here now, all right?
He's fucking gone, ain't he?

42:55.500 --> 42:58.457
So you work for me, Ron Kray!

42:58.583 --> 43:01.582
So you will trot along down
to the fucking bank,

43:01.708 --> 43:04.665
and you will fetch me my £50,000.

43:04.791 --> 43:07.457
Yeah, I'll go down to the bank
and see what I can do.

43:07.583 --> 43:09.707
And I'll tell you what,
I may work for you, Ron,

43:09.833 --> 43:13.915
but I'm certainly not afraid of you,
all right?

43:14.541 --> 43:17.540
Well, that is fucking stupid as well,
because you fucking should be.

43:17.666 --> 43:21.624
Because if my brother hadn't have
vouched for you, you'd be fucking dead.

43:49.875 --> 43:51.124
What happened?

43:52.041 --> 43:55.957
What are you doing here?
Didn't Ronnie tell you not to come?

43:58.208 --> 44:01.082
- I missed you.
- Look.

44:01.208 --> 44:04.082
Frankie, I don't want you to come here
and see me like this, understand?

44:04.208 --> 44:06.832
- Who did it?
- What?

44:06.958 --> 44:09.749
Your face.
Was it one of the other prisoners?

44:09.875 --> 44:13.540
No, no.
It was one of the guards, all right?

44:13.666 --> 44:15.790
- Well, have you reported them?
- No.

44:15.916 --> 44:17.624
But you know what?
When I get out, I'm thinking

44:17.750 --> 44:20.707
I might go to the Houses of Parliament,
have a word with the Prime Minister,

44:20.833 --> 44:22.374
'cause he will listen, he will.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.624
Frankie, this is prison, OK?

44:24.750 --> 44:28.207
That's what this is.
It's the law of the jungle in here.

44:28.333 --> 44:30.207
But don't worry about it,
because I'm a big boy,

44:30.333 --> 44:33.707
I can look after meself
and I'll be out very soon. All right?

44:33.833 --> 44:36.290
Go on, have a look at that lump
over there, you see him?

44:36.416 --> 44:37.582
With the big hat.

44:37.708 --> 44:41.207
There's a very good reason
why we all call him Handbag.

44:43.416 --> 44:44.999
All right?

44:47.500 --> 44:48.915
I don't want a life like this.

44:51.041 --> 44:54.624
- Just waiting, while you're in prison.
- I know. I know.

44:59.791 --> 45:02.624
- Frankie, it won't happen again.
- How can you be sure?

45:02.750 --> 45:05.915
Because I know. Because I promise you
it won't happen again.

45:06.041 --> 45:07.832
All right?

45:09.000 --> 45:10.624
I know how you can be sure.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.499
- Go on.
- You could go straight.

45:14.458 --> 45:18.374
Be a casino owner, a club owner.
You enjoy it.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.165
Just forget everything else.

45:20.291 --> 45:25.082
It really is that simple for you, innit?
Yeah, just go straight.

45:27.625 --> 45:31.290
Babe, life isn't always the way
we want it to be, you know.

45:31.416 --> 45:33.249
Life has other plans. It...

45:33.375 --> 45:35.999
- It's the way it is. It's life.
- I love you.

45:38.791 --> 45:40.832
I love you.

45:43.875 --> 45:47.290
I never loved anybody before,
but I love you, Reggie.

45:50.666 --> 45:51.915
And I love you, too.

45:58.041 --> 45:59.582
You think it can protect people?

46:00.750 --> 46:01.999
What?

46:02.125 --> 46:04.082
Love.

46:06.666 --> 46:10.165
I like him. Yeah, he got
something about him, ain't he?

46:10.291 --> 46:13.540
Do you know what I reckon it is?
I think it's his hips.

46:13.666 --> 46:16.832
I want to blow the soul out of that horn.

46:18.250 --> 46:20.290
You feeling a bit horny, are you, Ron?

46:21.291 --> 46:24.374
I am. I am.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.207
- Go on. Do it.
- I will. Yeah.

46:26.333 --> 46:28.582
I want to blow the soul out of that horn.

46:28.708 --> 46:32.124
That's what I'm gonna do.
OK? OK?

46:32.250 --> 46:34.124
Tiger!

46:43.708 --> 46:46.707
That's it, Ron, give it a fucking blow.

46:56.833 --> 46:58.124
Kill it.

47:05.500 --> 47:07.624
Oh, fucking hell.

47:07.750 --> 47:09.290
Right.

47:11.166 --> 47:12.749
Hello. Hello?

47:12.875 --> 47:14.124
Yes, Ron. Hello.

47:14.250 --> 47:17.415
Do you know when I plan to die?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.957
- When, Ron?
- At the very last minute.

47:22.875 --> 47:26.082
Don't fucking encourage him,
for fuck's sake.

47:27.875 --> 47:31.082
Look at you, you flash fuckers. Eh?

47:32.458 --> 47:36.290
Now, I may not be very good, granted.

47:36.416 --> 47:38.374
But good gangster?

47:39.083 --> 47:42.374
Oh, yeah.
I'll fucking claim that title.

47:42.500 --> 47:46.332
And how many titles
could you claim? Eh?

47:46.458 --> 47:49.582
Superficialite. Hmm?

47:49.708 --> 47:54.040
Oh, yeah.
Dripping in your synthetic opulence.

47:54.166 --> 47:55.790
Ha!

47:56.666 --> 48:00.540
It's disgusting. Really is.
Yeah.

48:00.666 --> 48:02.915
Right, a bit of magic.
You love magic, don't you?

48:03.041 --> 48:04.749
All kids love magic.

48:06.208 --> 48:09.957
You might all be aware
that there are three magic Cs, right,

48:10.083 --> 48:11.957
in the word "carpaccio". Yeah?

48:12.083 --> 48:15.332
But how many Cs...

48:17.250 --> 48:19.707
...are in the word "cunt"?

48:22.708 --> 48:24.749
Just you.

48:49.833 --> 48:50.874
You're free.

48:52.208 --> 48:54.165
What are you doing
throwing stones at the window?

48:54.291 --> 48:55.790
They're not, they're not stones.

48:55.916 --> 48:58.207
These are... these are lemon sherbets.
Here you go.

49:00.041 --> 49:02.124
Oh, well played.

49:02.250 --> 49:03.665
Why don't you ring the bell?

49:03.791 --> 49:06.124
Well, your mum.

49:06.250 --> 49:08.082
I mean, I'm not being funny,

49:08.208 --> 49:11.082
but the thought of your mum answering
that door is a bit shocking, so...

49:11.208 --> 49:13.082
I thought she'd give me grief
on account of where I've been.

49:13.208 --> 49:17.249
- You mean prison?
- Yeah, prison. You look beautiful.

49:18.166 --> 49:19.499
You look beautiful, too.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.124
I know it's a bit late, right, but...

49:22.250 --> 49:24.749
I've got your Christmas present here.

49:24.875 --> 49:26.665
- Do you want me to throw it up?
- No.

49:26.791 --> 49:30.749
What? You want me to deliver it?
I ain't going through that door.

49:30.875 --> 49:31.999
All right.

49:35.125 --> 49:36.374
You cheeky bugger.

49:41.166 --> 49:42.207
Be careful.

49:44.207 --> 49:45.525
A bit late now, innit?

49:45.625 --> 49:47.332
Right!

49:48.916 --> 49:51.249
- Your flowers.
- Thank you.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.707
And...

49:55.291 --> 49:57.624
...your Christmas present.

49:57.750 --> 49:59.499
Sorry it's late.

50:02.041 --> 50:03.874
Go on, open it.

50:07.375 --> 50:09.625
Frances Shea, will you marry me?

50:14.125 --> 50:15.874
We'll live free and above-board?

50:17.791 --> 50:19.290
On my honour.

50:22.625 --> 50:25.290
Yes, Reggie Kray, I will marry you.

50:31.041 --> 50:32.665
Mmm.

50:32.791 --> 50:34.040
That one of mine?

50:35.791 --> 50:36.832
Cheeky.

50:41.625 --> 50:43.124
That's it.

50:45.166 --> 50:47.499
Come on, show us your fucking hoochie.

50:47.625 --> 50:50.624
- Give us a fucking look.
- You're not listening. You're not listening.

50:50.750 --> 50:54.957
All I'm saying, all I'm saying
is crime is still a business.

50:55.083 --> 50:58.900
You need a public relations department,
and we've got Joseph Goebbels.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.082
Is he the fat one?

51:00.208 --> 51:03.749
You read lips. What's he saying?
What's he saying, Les?

51:03.875 --> 51:08.957
I'm struggling, but I think he's saying
something about gobbles or no balls?

51:10.375 --> 51:11.665
That's very strange.

51:13.166 --> 51:15.165
He ain't happy. You'll see.

51:21.083 --> 51:22.499
Nice, innit?

51:24.041 --> 51:26.874
Oh, he looks lovely, Ron.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.082
He's put on
a little bit of timber, ain't he?

51:30.208 --> 51:32.249
He's going to be very, very upset.

51:33.083 --> 51:35.040
Did I miss something?

51:36.208 --> 51:38.707
Is this not...
This is Friday night, right?

51:38.833 --> 51:40.165
Well, I tried to tell you.

51:40.291 --> 51:41.790
Yeah, but it's Friday night, right?

51:41.916 --> 51:43.790
You didn't tell me
that it was this bad, did you?

51:43.916 --> 51:46.874
It's Ron, innit?
He's run the place into the ground.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.790
He's turned a straight money earner
into a financial wreck.

51:49.916 --> 51:53.790
And another thing: This place will crash
when we get our tax bill next week.

51:53.916 --> 51:56.457
What's he saying? What's he saying?

51:56.583 --> 52:00.582
He's just told him that you're missing
tax payments. Silly cunt!

52:04.833 --> 52:06.415
Let's go.

52:07.333 --> 52:09.415
This is tomorrow's business.
Do you understand?

52:10.208 --> 52:11.749
That's very rude.

52:13.333 --> 52:17.207
- Oi, where are you going?
- It's fucking criminal, mate!

52:17.333 --> 52:18.790
Criminal!

52:19.500 --> 52:22.707
Hey, where are you going?

52:26.375 --> 52:29.832
Oh, there he is,
my beautiful brother, Reggie.

52:29.958 --> 52:32.374
A toast to my beautiful brother.

52:32.500 --> 52:36.749
Home at last,
like Agamemnon returned to Ithaca.

52:36.875 --> 52:38.832
And beautiful Frances.

52:38.958 --> 52:40.290
Where have you been?

52:40.416 --> 52:43.082
It's as if you've returned from the dead.

52:43.208 --> 52:46.540
What are you doing, mate?
What are you fucking playing at? Eh?

52:46.666 --> 52:48.249
I'm not playing at anything.
It's you.

52:48.375 --> 52:50.499
You come in here.
You don't even say, "Hello, Ron."

52:50.625 --> 52:53.165
You don't even have a drink.
You just bugger off.

52:53.291 --> 52:56.915
- Hello, Ron. Cheers, mate. Fuck you!
- What are you shouting at me for?

52:57.041 --> 52:58.915
Because you had the world
on a string, yeah?

52:59.041 --> 53:01.165
But you couldn't hold it together
so you fucked it up.

53:01.291 --> 53:04.040
- Don't... Listen, you was away.
- I was in prison.

53:04.166 --> 53:05.957
I had to make do with what I had.

53:06.083 --> 53:08.082
You going Ron or Reg?

53:09.791 --> 53:11.957
- Score?
- Mmm-hmm.

53:12.083 --> 53:14.957
Reginald. He'll never go down
in front of the missus.

53:15.083 --> 53:18.624
- You had everything, mate. You had it all.
- I didn't have you, did I?

53:18.750 --> 53:20.957
- Reggie, please.
- It's all right, honestly. I got this. It's fine.

53:21.083 --> 53:23.915
Yeah, actually, he's got this.
Thank you very much. He's a big boy.

53:24.041 --> 53:25.624
We're talking about earning a living.

53:25.750 --> 53:28.374
We're talking about being gangsters,
right, which is what we are.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.874
- So you can just fuck off. Go on.
- Don't.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.415
You know, one of these days, Ron Kray,
your miserable life will swallow you whole.

53:36.250 --> 53:39.915
You should know all about that, because
I've heard all the stories. They're not good.

53:40.041 --> 53:42.665
Your mum did palm us off
with the damaged goods, didn't she?

53:42.791 --> 53:44.499
You're very, very damaged, aren't you?

53:44.625 --> 53:45.915
All right, just get in the car.

53:46.041 --> 53:48.707
- Don't ever speak to her like that again.
- Yeah, that's right, Frances.

53:48.833 --> 53:52.165
Blood is thicker than water,
and I've been with Reggie since the womb.

53:52.291 --> 53:55.374
Ron, shut up. I want you to apologise
to Frances right now.

53:55.500 --> 53:57.165
- Right.
- All right.

53:57.291 --> 54:00.374
Right, right. Frances.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.374
I'm sorry, all right? Yes.

54:02.500 --> 54:06.624
I'm truly very sorry
the club's very, very empty.

54:06.750 --> 54:11.374
A bit like you, really. There's fuck-all in it,
apart from my brother's cock.

54:29.166 --> 54:32.874
You, all right,
are a fucking disgrace, mate.

54:35.750 --> 54:37.499
You hit me.

54:38.791 --> 54:40.499
Yeah.

54:44.708 --> 54:47.582
- No! No!
- No, Ron.

54:47.708 --> 54:48.915
No! No!

54:52.916 --> 54:55.249
I fucking did, you fucking cunt!

54:58.583 --> 55:00.582
Fucking cunt!

55:03.250 --> 55:05.707
- Fuck's sake!
- Not the bottle. Not the...

55:10.416 --> 55:12.849
No! Not the balls!

55:14.500 --> 55:16.207
My fucking nuts! Wanker!

55:20.458 --> 55:22.374
Sweetheart, please leave.

55:23.208 --> 55:25.249
Biting! Biting cunt!

55:33.000 --> 55:34.040
Ah!

55:35.916 --> 55:37.374
Give me that.

55:41.458 --> 55:44.415
Never mess with a man's jewels, mate.
What the fuck...

55:48.166 --> 55:52.165
Now what are you doing?
No, Ron. No. No, no. That's a bottle, Ron.

55:52.291 --> 55:55.624
- That's a bottle!
- I'll serve you up, you fucking cunt!

55:55.750 --> 55:57.582
It's a bottle, Ron!

55:57.708 --> 56:00.165
That's enough.

56:00.291 --> 56:02.249
Pack it in. That's enough!

56:02.375 --> 56:04.207
- I'm going to split them up.
- Shut up, mate.

56:04.333 --> 56:05.749
Get back and sit down in your chair.

56:06.333 --> 56:07.999
No. They're family.

56:08.125 --> 56:09.874
Stay back.
Get out of the fucking way.

56:12.083 --> 56:13.582
Put it down!

56:16.416 --> 56:19.124
OK, now, I told you!

56:19.250 --> 56:21.749
Come on, that's enough.

56:24.666 --> 56:26.457
No.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.290
No.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.874
Enough, Reg, mate.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.374
You just don't understand, you don't...

56:35.500 --> 56:37.082
Fuck.

56:37.208 --> 56:39.582
You don't understand me.

56:39.708 --> 56:43.082
That's probably 'cause I don't want to
fucking understand you right now, Ron.

56:43.208 --> 56:44.582
I wanted to just, you know...

56:44.708 --> 56:49.207
There's no point in
fucking explaining it to you, either.

56:50.791 --> 56:53.290
It's fucking hopeless.
Come on, help me up.

56:53.416 --> 56:55.332
Just help me out here, will you?

56:55.458 --> 56:58.040
- That fucking hurt.
- All right, mate. What are you doing?

56:58.166 --> 56:59.540
For fuck's sake, Ron.

56:59.666 --> 57:04.249
Reggie, what I'm trying to tell you
is very simple, all right?

57:04.375 --> 57:05.790
Listen.

57:05.916 --> 57:12.124
I am very, very, very fragile, myself.

57:12.250 --> 57:13.374
All right?

57:13.500 --> 57:15.374
Yeah, fragile, I've got it.

57:15.500 --> 57:18.482
- Very fragile.
- I've got it.

57:26.916 --> 57:28.582
All right, come on, now.
For fuck's sake.

57:28.708 --> 57:31.332
I'm not myself, am I?

57:31.458 --> 57:33.665
I mean, this isn't me. Is it?

57:33.791 --> 57:36.582
This isn't us.
None of this is us, is it?

57:39.208 --> 57:41.207
- I'm very sorry.
- It's OK.

57:41.958 --> 57:42.999
Are you done?

57:44.083 --> 57:45.499
Has she gone?

57:45.625 --> 57:48.582
- Yes, she's gone, mate.
- She's a keeper.

57:48.708 --> 57:50.790
She is. Thank you, Ron.
Thanks.

58:02.666 --> 58:05.415
- There she is.
- Yeah, I got her.

58:05.541 --> 58:07.415
All right, stop here.

58:08.541 --> 58:10.582
That girl's gonna be the death of me.

58:10.708 --> 58:12.040
Mind how you go.

58:12.750 --> 58:15.332
Frankie. Frank. Excuse me. Sorry.

58:15.458 --> 58:17.957
I need to have a word with you
about something.

58:18.083 --> 58:19.540
I don't care if you forget me.

58:19.666 --> 58:21.415
- Don't say that.
- It's true.

58:21.541 --> 58:22.582
You don't mean it.

58:22.708 --> 58:24.499
Don't tell me what I mean.
I know what I mean.

58:24.625 --> 58:26.832
Come on, Frances, please.
Can't we just start again?

58:26.958 --> 58:28.415
From the beginning, you know.

58:28.541 --> 58:32.165
We can get rid of everything that's bad,
and we'll just keep everything that's good.

58:32.916 --> 58:36.040
- What about Ron?
- What about Ron?

58:36.625 --> 58:38.082
He's not exactly a good bit, is he?

58:38.208 --> 58:41.124
Well... I mean,
he's not exactly a bad bit, either.

58:41.250 --> 58:43.790
- He was awful to me.
- Yeah, he was. But, you know, that...

58:43.916 --> 58:49.207
That's Ron. If he don't take his tablets,
he's like that. He's a nightmare.

58:50.250 --> 58:52.707
He's not always like that, you know.
He's got a heart of gold.

58:52.833 --> 58:54.540
He loves you to bits.
He thinks the world of you.

58:54.666 --> 58:56.290
Honestly, when you left, he was in pieces.

58:56.416 --> 58:58.790
He was like, "Where's she gone?"
I said, "She's left."

58:58.916 --> 59:01.691
"Well, you better get after her
'cause she's a keeper."

59:01.791 --> 59:05.207
You are a keeper. So he's right.
He said, "Tell her I'm very sorry."

59:05.333 --> 59:09.165
He is sorry and I'm sorry.
We're all sorry. But you know, that...

59:09.291 --> 59:11.874
That's what happens sometimes.
Families are stupid, aren't they?

59:12.000 --> 59:14.290
You know, they fight,
you know, they make up.

59:14.416 --> 59:17.957
And ultimately, you know, they stick
together 'cause they love each other.

59:18.083 --> 59:19.790
It's what they do.

59:21.416 --> 59:24.582
Don't tell me about forgetting you,
'cause that ain't happening, either.

59:24.708 --> 59:26.874
I spent the last six months
thinking about nothing but you.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.999
- So I get out and the club's gone up...
- All right. All right.

59:30.125 --> 59:33.040
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

59:33.166 --> 59:37.707
'It was time for the Krays to enter
the secret history of the 1960s.

59:42.083 --> 59:43.540
'As absurd as it seems,

59:43.666 --> 59:48.374
'it grew out of Ron's nutter dream
of building a utopian city in Nigeria.'

59:49.791 --> 59:52.582
Some are born to be Ronnie Kray,

59:52.708 --> 59:56.665
and some have Ronnie Kray
thrust upon them.

59:58.083 --> 01:00:00.582
'Lord Boothby was a distinguished member

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:01.749
'of the House of Lords.'

01:00:01.875 --> 01:00:04.040
- Ronnie.
- Yes.

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:07.040
I regret that my answer is no.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.957
Nigeria is simply too far away

01:00:11.083 --> 01:00:15.249
and I never involve myself
in a thing I can't control personally.

01:00:16.708 --> 01:00:18.415
I'm so sorry.

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:23.957
He's really lovely, isn't he?

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.874
I take it you like ice and a slice,
my Lord?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.540
Ice and a slice.

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:31.915
Please, Teddy Bear.

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:34.415
And don't spare the horses.

01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:41.165
Do you know where I hear the lemons
are particularly lovely and fresh?

01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:42.874
No, where?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.082
Enugu, Nigeria.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.874
You are very well-informed, Teddy.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.624
Very well-informed.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.165
Down the hatch.

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:55.665
Do you like it down the hatch, Teddy?

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:59.499
'Boothby declined, but friendship ensued

'The ripples would spread far and wide.'

Do call me later, Tom.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:11.124
Harry, all alone?

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.707
No need to be,
plenty of fruit on the tree.

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:17.332
Tom, not in the House of Commons tonight?

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:19.582
Yeah?

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:22.499
Fucking look at me, you cunt.

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:24.790
Yeah?

01:01:24.916 --> 01:01:28.040
Go on, fucking look at him now.

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:30.082
Fucking look at me.

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:33.999
But he looks up at me!

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.874
Good Lord, that's Bob Boothby.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.665
Yes, Prime Minister, sir.

01:01:41.791 --> 01:01:43.999
At an orgy.

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:46.874
The Tories are going to have trouble
explaining this.

01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.457
Here, sir.

01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:55.374
Is that Tom Driberg?

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.915
In fact, yes, sir.

01:01:57.041 --> 01:02:00.832
There's no moral advantage to my party
if my party are also involved.

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:02.832
It gets a bit stickier, sir.

01:02:02.958 --> 01:02:05.749
- Where were these photos taken?
- Cazenove Road, Hackney.

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:08.415
What in God's boots
were they doing in Hackney?

01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:09.582
That's where it gets sticky.

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:12.249
I thought the orgy was the sticky bit.
It gets stickier still?

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:16.207
We've had two brothers, gangsters,
under surveillance. The Krays.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.540
The photographs
were taken in Ronald Kray's flat.

01:02:20.666 --> 01:02:24.665
Orgies aside, we're tracking fraud,
protection rackets

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:27.915
and the American Mafia
might also be involved.

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:31.374
'London's bottom had reached her top.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.790
'Scandal loomed.'

The elections are in 10 weeks.

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:37.124
They'll vote out both sides of the House.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.749
What exactly are you doing about it?

01:02:39.875 --> 01:02:41.249
Bugger all, by the looks of it.

01:02:44.541 --> 01:02:46.332
Is that Italian?

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:49.082
- Don't know.
- Is it a Daimler?

01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:52.290
It's nice, that is.

01:02:52.416 --> 01:02:54.415
Oh, what do you want for Christmas?

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:56.999
Um... I don't know.

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.874
- You don't have to get me anything.
- Eh?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.665
- You don't have to get me a present.
- Ah, that's ridiculous.

01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:03.332
Not get you anything for Christmas?

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:05.790
All right, well, just surprise me, then.
Surprise me.

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:08.290
I'll get you a sock full of coal,
you lucky thing.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.249
What about that?

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:11.749
What about it?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.749
For Christmas.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:15.332
For me?

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.374
That's gonna be my club.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.457
- Is it?
- Yeah.

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:22.915
In the West End, just a touch of class.

01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:26.415
That's our ticket out of here.

01:03:29.458 --> 01:03:31.249
It's snowing.

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.290
Yeah.

01:03:34.416 --> 01:03:36.249
Gone.

'What did I want for Christmas?

intimidated by the working classes,

- It tastes shit.

- I love your mouth! Mmm!
- I signed the contract.

with Reggie, ask him.

- Crap.
- Gentlemen, please.

- Please, I have customers.
- Out of the way. That's it, come on.

Please! I have customers here!
Gentlemen, please. I've spoken to Reggie.

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:32.457
But I can tomorrow.

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:36.415
- All right.
- Sorry.

01:18:36.541 --> 01:18:39.040
♪ Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner

01:18:40.708 --> 01:18:43.124
♪ That I love London town... ♪

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.165
Kray.

01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:49.207
- Kray.
- Kray.

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:54.040
There's an inherent threat
in that one commanding syllable.

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:56.707
It's the only word some need to hear.

01:18:57.541 --> 01:18:59.540
What does that mean, "the only word"?

01:19:00.166 --> 01:19:02.165
Well, you're like Ford.

01:19:02.291 --> 01:19:05.957
Or Shell.
Or Woolworth's.

01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:07.499
Woolworth's.

01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:10.415
Yeah, that's very interesting.

01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:14.040
All I'm saying is Kray is a brand

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:18.915
and an established reputation needs less
maintenance, less violence, you know?

01:19:19.041 --> 01:19:20.749
People fall naturally into line.

01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:23.332
Clubs are asking for our protection
before we even offer it.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.415
Yeah. That's true, actually,
they are. Yes.

01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:29.582
I suppose that would leave us
with less straightening out to do.

01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:31.749
- Exactly. That's right.
- Yeah.

01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:34.332
Makes sense.

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:36.665
But I happen to like...

01:19:36.791 --> 01:19:39.207
I like straightening out,
you know, once in a while.

01:19:39.333 --> 01:19:41.499
Obliging someone in the old cobbles.

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:42.874
What's wrong with that?

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.499
I just think you could do better, Ron.
You know.

01:19:46.625 --> 01:19:49.540
It'll keep you out of prison, I mean,
none of us are getting any younger.

01:19:49.666 --> 01:19:52.040
You know, you need to leave
all this behind, I mean...

01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:55.082
You got to look to the future,
you and that lovely young wife of yours.

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.040
No! Fairy tales!

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:58.749
That's fucking warning!

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:02.499
This is a firm, right?
I'm a fucking face.

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:05.374
I'll fucking serve you up,
you fucking cunt!

01:20:06.399 --> 01:20:08.207
You're fucking bang out of order!

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:11.415
I don't fucking like him, I don't trust him.
He asks too many questions.

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:14.582
- I want him fucking dead!
- Leslie Payne, right, is our business,

01:20:14.708 --> 01:20:16.082
and you want him dead.

01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:19.290
- Have you been taking your tablets?
- Fuck tablets, right? Bugger tablets!

01:20:19.416 --> 01:20:22.082
Bugger Payne,
the fucking pain in the arse!

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.415
And fuck his briefcase!

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:27.082
I don't give a fuck what's in there,
I want to know what's going on up there.

01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:35.374
He knows too much about things.
Things about us.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.624
Reggie, he knows too many things about us.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.707
He knows too many things about us?
Right.

01:20:39.833 --> 01:20:42.082
Albie, do you know things about us, mate?

01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:43.790
Do you know things? Eh?

01:20:43.916 --> 01:20:46.415
About Ron, about me,
about the firm, right?

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.415
You know about payments, right?

01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:50.124
You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.665
D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em
look fucking favourably upon us, do you?

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:54.999
Yes.

01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:56.874
You do. There's a fucking surprise.
Jack!

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.707
Mate, do you know anything about fraud?

01:20:58.833 --> 01:21:00.374
Anything at all? Take a punt.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.582
Do you know anything about
how we pay off policemen

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:05.332
every fucking final Thursday of the month?

01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:07.499
- Do you know that?
- Of course I do.

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:10.207
Fucking surprise, that.
So why don't we kill Jack now?

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:12.540
Or we do Albie as well?
We do the fucking lot.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.207
Or you can do me and I'll do you
and we're both fucking dead!

01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:17.707
That's a genius idea!

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:20.665
Listen to yourself, Ron!
You're fucking nuts!

01:21:21.416 --> 01:21:22.915
Mmm.

01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:30.290
People who live in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones.

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:35.582
You know
I never drank gin till I came here?

01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:39.220
Oh, well, next you'll be singing
God Save the Queen, won't you?

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:42.999
What did you want to have
a word with me about, Mr Bruno?

01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:45.957
Things are going well,
we're very happy on my side of the pond.

01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.790
Well, that's good.
You know, we're very happy also.

01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:51.249
OK.

01:21:51.375 --> 01:21:52.832
Cheers.

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:54.749
Cheers.

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:58.457
You realise I asked
to speak to you alone. Um...

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:03.040
You see, in our line of work,

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:04.915
it's not good to be famous.

01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:08.332
Anonymous is the goal.

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:11.832
This Mr Lansky, Reg,

01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:14.290
he sees a lot of potential in you.

01:22:15.125 --> 01:22:17.290
But he sees limitations
in your brother Ron.

01:22:17.833 --> 01:22:18.957
Well, you know, maybe...

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:21.999
Maybe they could just sit down
and meet each other, couldn't they?

01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:23.832
I mean, he could come across for a chat.

01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:25.707
A chat?

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.499
You guys crack me up, really.

01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:31.415
You ever hear of the Gallo brothers?

01:22:31.541 --> 01:22:32.999
- From Brooklyn?
- No.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:35.707
Similar loose cannon situation.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.874
You see, Ron is your Joey.

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:40.999
And it's not gonna end well
in either case.

01:22:45.708 --> 01:22:48.415
What exactly are you
asking me to do, Mr Bruno?

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:51.832
I'm asking you to do something about Ron.

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:56.624
I can't do that.

01:22:58.041 --> 01:22:59.915
He's my brother.

01:23:01.916 --> 01:23:03.290
OK.

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:50.207
- There's nothing I can do.
- I ain't finished with you yet.

01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:54.374
- Mr Kray takes care of this warehouse.
- Now, you say Kray one more time...

01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:57.915
...and I'm gonna hit you, you understand?

01:23:58.041 --> 01:23:59.415
I have an arrangement with Mr Kray.

01:23:59.541 --> 01:24:01.582
I didn't ask whether we had
an arrangement.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:04.582
I asked if you understood me.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.707
'The Richardson gang were away.

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:11.790
'But George Cornell had crossed the river
to work a protection racket on their behalf.'

01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:14.415
I fucking warned you!

01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:17.999
'Ron's response would secure
his place in gangster legend.'

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:19.915
What is that,
is that English breakfast tea?

01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:22.082
I can tell by your face, Ted,
what you think of it.

01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:25.957
- Lovely box, isn't it? It's beautiful.
- It's not English breakfast. That's not, no.

01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:28.790
That's got pheromones in it, that's got.

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:31.374
It's musky.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.957
That's a bit of magic, that is.

01:24:34.791 --> 01:24:36.665
That's very beautiful, innit?

01:24:36.791 --> 01:24:39.707
- I'm glad you like it.
- I do, that's proper.

01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:42.540
Me mum will be very,
very pleased with that.

01:24:42.666 --> 01:24:44.832
Did you have that away
from the old warehouse, did you?

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:47.332
- Yeah.
- Don't say anything. It's all right.

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:49.790
- Regards to Mrs Kray.
- Thank you.

01:24:49.916 --> 01:24:53.165
- For the other matter.
- Yeah. What matter?

01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:03.832
That?

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:05.999
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:25:07.291 --> 01:25:10.374
I mean, I'm not in the mind
to hand out refunds, am I?

01:25:14.125 --> 01:25:15.999
Can't you handle it yourself?

01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.374
I pay you for protection, Ron.

01:25:23.541 --> 01:25:25.832
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing...

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:28.582
No, you just said it.
You just fucking said it.

01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:31.540
You come in here
with your fucking nose, right,

01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:33.874
and your tea.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.957
Your fucking exotic tea.

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:37.165
Right?

01:25:37.291 --> 01:25:39.165
And you say that.

01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:41.540
I'm not very good at my job.

01:25:41.666 --> 01:25:44.207
- I didn't mean it like that.
- You fucking did!

01:25:45.458 --> 01:25:48.540
- No, I...
- Ah! I'll tell you what.

01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.665
This matter of yours...

01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:55.249
- I'll deal with it for you. All right?
- All right.

01:25:55.375 --> 01:25:57.332
You go with Teddy, right,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.790
and you bring me £2,000, OK?

01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:06.624
And in return, I promise
that I will have George Cornell killed.

01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:09.249
All right?

01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:11.249
- I didn't say...
- All right?

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:13.749
I didn't say anything about killing, Ron.

01:26:13.875 --> 01:26:16.165
You fucking did.

01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:18.915
You fucking meant it.
Look at you, you meant it with your eyes.

01:26:19.041 --> 01:26:22.582
Look at your eyes. Eh?
It's in your fucking eyes!

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:24.665
- Or are you threatening me?
- No.

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:27.332
'Cause there's death in your eyes
and you're fucking threatening me!

01:26:27.458 --> 01:26:29.207
- Is he threatening me?
- It's hard to tell, Ron.

01:26:29.333 --> 01:26:30.415
- I'll pay.
- You'll what?

01:26:30.541 --> 01:26:31.624
- I'll pay.
- You will?

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:34.374
- Yeah.
- There it is. And a deal is a deal.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:35.790
- It's done.
- Yeah.

01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:38.540
It's done. It's over.
Teddy, take him.

01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:41.040
Thank you.

01:26:41.166 --> 01:26:43.540
- That's very kind of you.
- Thank you.

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.415
For the tea.

01:26:48.333 --> 01:26:49.957
That's a good deal.

01:27:10.875 --> 01:27:12.582
How do I look?

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:14.957
Fucking deadly.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:19.249
- Do you want me to come in with you?
- Hmm?

01:27:19.375 --> 01:27:20.540
In there?

01:27:23.041 --> 01:27:24.499
Come on.

01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:27.040
You all stay in the car.

01:27:29.615 --> 01:27:31.249
Anything you need to tell me?

01:27:38.708 --> 01:27:40.499
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:43.374
Jesus!

01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:48.915
Yeah, you're not laughing now, are you?

01:27:50.041 --> 01:27:51.999
For fuck's sake.

01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:55.040
Boss, the fuck...

01:27:58.583 --> 01:28:00.415
Get the fuck down!

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.290
Don't say a fucking word!

01:28:02.416 --> 01:28:04.249
What are you fucking looking at?

01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:05.790
You didn't see nothing!

01:28:09.186 --> 01:28:10.926
Fuck.

01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:13.707
That's Ronnie Kray, that, isn't it?

01:28:13.833 --> 01:28:15.207
Fucking hell.

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:30.499
Reggie.

01:28:31.916 --> 01:28:32.957
Are you mad?

01:28:35.416 --> 01:28:38.332
The Blind Beggar? Yeah, Cornell?

01:28:38.458 --> 01:28:39.707
It's on the fucking radio.

01:28:39.833 --> 01:28:41.665
Reggie.

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:43.665
Hi, Mum.

01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:47.665
Oh. Thank you.

01:28:47.791 --> 01:28:50.707
Oh! Look at you.

01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.374
Look how handsome you are!

01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:58.915
- I'll get you a cup of tea.
- Thanks, Mum.

01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:01.415
- Albie?
- I'm all right, Violet, thank you.

01:29:07.583 --> 01:29:09.665
You do look lovely, Reggie.

01:29:11.458 --> 01:29:12.707
How many witnesses?

01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:15.040
It was a quiet night.

01:29:15.166 --> 01:29:17.082
- Seven?
- Seven?

01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:21.082
Albert Woods was with Cornell.
Plus five regulars, don't know them.

01:29:21.208 --> 01:29:24.457
And the barmaid, the blonde, the one
with the big fucking pair of eyes.

01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:25.957
For fuck's sake.

01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:28.457
And you bring this here?
You bring it straight to Mum's?

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:31.082
Don't moan about it, all right?
It's done, innit?

01:29:31.208 --> 01:29:33.624
What are we gonna do, hmm?

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:35.707
- "We"?
- Yeah.

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:43.415
Where's the weapon?

01:29:43.541 --> 01:29:45.415
It's here, Reg.

01:29:47.958 --> 01:29:50.332
There you go. Now...

01:29:50.458 --> 01:29:52.790
- Here, let me have it.
- Would you like a piece of cake?

01:29:52.916 --> 01:29:55.540
Do you know what? That would be lovely.
Yeah. Thank you, Mum.

01:29:55.666 --> 01:29:58.874
- It is, it's lovely.
- Thanks.

01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:03.165
I assume you were in those clothes, right?

01:30:03.291 --> 01:30:05.624
Yeah, yeah.

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:07.415
So where's his jacket?

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:08.749
Right, you need to burn that.

01:30:08.875 --> 01:30:11.374
And that gun, we need to toss it
in the river right fucking now.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.082
Go on, fuck off.

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:20.790
You are...
You're unbelievable.

01:30:22.041 --> 01:30:23.457
Albie?

01:30:23.583 --> 01:30:26.165
Whoever was in that pub,
we need to find out who they are,

01:30:26.291 --> 01:30:29.415
get hold of them and just unravel
whatever they've said to the police.

01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:32.207
We need to undo, so get Big Pat,
Bender, send them down there now.

01:30:32.333 --> 01:30:33.874
- The barmaid I know, right?
- You know her.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.374
Well, bring her to me,
I'll deal with her myself, all right?

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:37.540
Go on. Fuck off.

01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:39.832
Oh.

01:30:39.958 --> 01:30:41.790
Where's everybody gone?

01:30:42.333 --> 01:30:45.165
Oh, Mum, it's late, it's late.
I wanted them out of your hair, you know.

01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:47.415
You should get some bed time.

01:30:47.541 --> 01:30:49.290
Why don't I give you a lift home?
Come on.

01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:52.707
Oh, it's all right, I am home.

01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:56.207
I've made a bed up for him.
He's not well.

01:30:56.333 --> 01:30:58.124
He's...

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.273
He's got a fever.

01:31:01.265 --> 01:31:03.432
He's going to stay here the night.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.249
Teddy, would you like to stay with him?

01:31:09.791 --> 01:31:12.790
Thank you, that'd be very nice.
Thank you, Violet.

01:31:19.166 --> 01:31:21.290
Whatever he's done,

01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:24.082
he's your brother.

01:31:26.583 --> 01:31:28.582
Yeah.

01:31:34.125 --> 01:31:35.374
Yeah.

01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:37.915
Well, um...

01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:42.290
Here's your Stemetil, mate.

01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:44.999
You should take that.

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:50.082
Do you know what?
I'm going to have to go, actually.

01:31:50.208 --> 01:31:54.415
'Cause, um, I left the lads at work
and I have to clean up.

01:31:55.833 --> 01:31:57.665
So, I'm going to say goodnight.

01:31:57.791 --> 01:31:58.832
Goodnight.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.790
Teddy, now, you couldn't do us a favour,
could you? Be useful.

01:32:05.916 --> 01:32:09.874
And when you take his trousers off tonight
and his shirt, can you burn them?

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.707
Yeah? And check in with me.

01:32:11.833 --> 01:32:13.665
- Yeah.
- Good lad.

01:32:14.541 --> 01:32:16.457
- Night-night.
- Goodnight.

01:32:16.583 --> 01:32:17.707
Goodnight, Reggie.

01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:25.540
He's lovely, isn't he?

01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:34.707
'Not even Scotland Yard
could ignore murder on the streets.

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:36.915
'Nipper was back on the case.'

01:32:37.041 --> 01:32:39.165
Gentlemen, your attention, please.

01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:44.332
Now, you've been told that we're
conducting a high-level investigation

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.790
into a major corruption allegation.

01:32:46.916 --> 01:32:53.165
In fact, we're going down into the sewer
after the Krays.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.457
Any man with any objection,
come and see me.

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:05.374
See that lamppost up there, right?

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.332
That was known as a safety point
during the war, right?

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:10.040
So, if you could run to that lamppost,

01:33:10.166 --> 01:33:12.415
you knew that you could make it
to the air raid shelter

01:33:12.541 --> 01:33:14.457
before the bombs started dropping.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.082
One night, right, me and Ron,
we just stood there and we watched.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.124
We saw the old Stanton house
get blown to bits, they were still in it.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.124
It's a wonder you lived through it.

01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:29.915
Yeah, yeah, especially with Ron, you know.

01:33:30.041 --> 01:33:33.665
Every time trouble came on top, he was
always dragging behind, wasn't he?

01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:36.665
He's got plenty of trouble now,
if the stories are true.

01:33:38.375 --> 01:33:40.457
I heard it on the street, Reggie.

01:33:41.125 --> 01:33:43.082
My own family and you didn't tell me.

01:33:43.208 --> 01:33:45.915
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want you to worry, did I?

01:33:46.041 --> 01:33:47.624
I don't worry about Ron.

01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:50.207
- What do you plan to do about it?
- I'm not gonna let him go to prison.

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:51.999
- Why not?
- Why not?

01:33:53.416 --> 01:33:55.415
Why not? Because he's my brother,
that's why not.

01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:57.124
He'll still be your brother in prison.

01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:58.874
No.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.790
No, Frances, look, he belongs here, right?
He belongs with us.

01:34:01.916 --> 01:34:04.957
He belongs with you, me and his family,
this is his home, all right?

01:34:05.083 --> 01:34:08.457
I've been looking after Ron since we were
little boys, it's just the way it is.

01:34:08.583 --> 01:34:10.999
You can still look after him in prison.

01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:13.582
And he doesn't belong here
and you know it.

01:34:14.708 --> 01:34:16.249
Right.

01:34:17.541 --> 01:34:19.790
Right, well, you just don't understand.

01:34:19.916 --> 01:34:21.249
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

01:34:21.375 --> 01:34:24.249
Yes, I do. You once told me
you don't owe the world a thing.

01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:26.582
Well, you don't owe Ron a thing, either.

01:34:27.875 --> 01:34:30.832
My loyalty for my brother is how
I measure myself, do you understand?

01:34:30.958 --> 01:34:33.332
What about your loyalty to me,
is that not a measure?

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:37.915
So... what is going on
with your eyes right now?

01:34:38.041 --> 01:34:41.249
Are you on something?
Are you taking something, Frances?

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.790
Are you taking pills again?
Let's have a look.

01:34:43.916 --> 01:34:45.374
- Oh, hello. Look at that.
- Stop it.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.832
Jesus Christ, how many
of these things are you on?

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:51.249
No wonder you're not making any sense.
You're a pill popper.

01:34:51.375 --> 01:34:53.290
- And who made me that?
- What? A pill popper?

01:34:55.666 --> 01:34:57.749
So, let me get this straight.
What you're saying is that

01:34:57.875 --> 01:34:59.832
in order for us all to be free, yeah,

01:34:59.958 --> 01:35:02.165
that we all have to be on our own?

01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:06.415
That's great, Frances.
Let's just... I'll go with that.

01:35:06.541 --> 01:35:09.582
- Listen, talk to that barmaid.
- Yeah?

01:35:09.708 --> 01:35:11.874
Tell her when they line the suspects up
across from her

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.249
to point her finger at Ron
and say, "That's him.

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.249
"That's the mad hatter what done it."

01:35:16.375 --> 01:35:17.957
All right?

01:35:19.041 --> 01:35:21.415
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:25.582
- What about me mum?
- Fuck your mum!

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:52.707
- Take your time.
- No.

01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:55.540
The man who shot Cornell, he's not here.

01:35:56.458 --> 01:35:57.874
Are you sure?

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.249
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:36:01.208 --> 01:36:03.540
Please, could someone just take me home?

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.290
Miss.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:21.999
I swear to God.

01:36:22.125 --> 01:36:24.749
I smelt something,
I don't know what I smelt.

01:36:24.875 --> 01:36:27.415
There were some good funny looks
in the room towards the judge.

01:36:28.583 --> 01:36:31.207
A bit stinky, he was.

01:36:31.333 --> 01:36:33.749
Right?
Am I right or am I wrong?

01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:35.665
- No. No.
- Shh.

01:36:35.791 --> 01:36:37.957
Just goes to show,
you can give a dog a bad name,

01:36:38.083 --> 01:36:40.457
but when that dog's name is Kray,
it might bite you back. Well done.

01:36:40.583 --> 01:36:42.374
Well done, Ronnie.
Justice is served.

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.165
- Mea culpa. Mea culpa. Eh?
- Drink to my little bunny.

01:36:45.291 --> 01:36:46.624
Welcome home.

01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:48.249
Maxima.

01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:49.832
It's discipline.

01:36:49.958 --> 01:36:52.415
- Come and sit down, Vi.
- No.

01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:55.457
Give her a pink wafer.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.290
What did you tell her?

01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:23.915
I just said, "You might want to think
about your children." You know?

01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:29.165
I wish I could make you go away.

01:37:30.125 --> 01:37:31.999
Well, good luck with that, Frances.

01:37:32.125 --> 01:37:34.207

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:39.749
To be honest,
I think you're getting out just in time.

01:41:39.875 --> 01:41:42.415
- You think so?
- Absolutely, yeah.

01:41:42.541 --> 01:41:44.749
There's so many people
who know so much about us.

01:41:44.875 --> 01:41:47.665
Not you, of course. You know.

01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:50.332
Most people hate us.

01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:55.457
Sooner or later, someone's going to talk
and that'll be it, it'll be over.

01:41:55.583 --> 01:41:57.415
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

01:41:57.541 --> 01:41:59.290
Mmm.

01:42:00.708 --> 01:42:03.582
I think God ought to cut us
some slack, though, don't you think?

01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:07.540
Yeah, I'm sure God will.

01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:11.249
That is, uh...

01:42:12.083 --> 01:42:13.540
That is bang out of order.

01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:16.457
That's not how we were brought up,
not at all.

01:42:17.375 --> 01:42:18.415
Ron, I've got to go.

01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:21.999
Yeah, course you do.
Listen here, Frances, right?

01:42:23.375 --> 01:42:25.624
We both love him, all right?

01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:28.124
We both made the effort.

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:31.499
So we shall just have to see
what happens when we get there.

01:42:33.916 --> 01:42:35.499
Where?

01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:38.582
Heaven.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.332
Goodbye, Ron.

01:42:47.958 --> 01:42:49.832
Bye, Frances.

01:42:50.791 --> 01:42:52.749
Listen here,

01:42:53.958 --> 01:42:57.290
I always liked you, Frances, I always did.

01:42:58.333 --> 01:43:02.249
'Cause you have the ability
to see into the future.

01:43:02.375 --> 01:43:03.999
You do.

01:43:04.916 --> 01:43:06.999
And that's the same as me.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.832
Bye, now.

01:43:54.125 --> 01:43:56.082
All right, Reggie?

01:43:56.208 --> 01:43:57.999
How are you?

01:43:58.125 --> 01:44:00.582
Yeah. You all right, Frank?
Long time no see, eh?

01:44:00.708 --> 01:44:02.790
- I've been walking straight, you know.
- Oh, yeah?

01:44:02.916 --> 01:44:05.374
- Yeah.
- That's nice, innit?

01:44:06.250 --> 01:44:07.957
That's nice.

01:44:08.083 --> 01:44:09.749
What can I do for you?

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:12.374
Frances here?

01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:17.540
It's just that I've been outside your
parents' house the last couple of weeks.

01:44:17.666 --> 01:44:21.124
And they hadn't told me
that she left, so, you know,

01:44:21.250 --> 01:44:24.332
I've been standing underneath
her window like a fool.

01:44:26.541 --> 01:44:28.999
- Yeah, she's here.
- Yeah, I know.

01:44:30.791 --> 01:44:33.040
- Reggie...
- What?

01:44:35.833 --> 01:44:38.749
I haven't seen her like this
in a long time.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.249
She's delicate.

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.999
Right. All right.

01:44:43.125 --> 01:44:45.415
You tell Frances to come out here
'cause I had to come out here.

01:44:45.541 --> 01:44:48.082
- Why don't you just go and get Frances?
- I'm not letting you see her.

01:44:48.208 --> 01:44:50.582
- Don't fuck about!
- Frank?

01:44:50.708 --> 01:44:52.582
Frances, get back inside.
What are you doing?

01:44:52.708 --> 01:44:53.915
It's OK.

01:44:54.041 --> 01:44:55.665
Hi, Reggie.

01:44:56.375 --> 01:44:57.915
Hello, Frances.

01:44:59.833 --> 01:45:01.082
Have you got a moment?

01:45:02.458 --> 01:45:03.707
Let's have a little chat.

01:45:03.833 --> 01:45:06.082
- It's all right.
- Are you sure about this?

01:45:07.291 --> 01:45:09.582
Go inside and put the kettle on.

01:45:13.125 --> 01:45:14.832
Frankie, come home.

01:45:15.708 --> 01:45:17.290
I am home.

01:45:18.541 --> 01:45:20.582
At least until I find somewhere else.

01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:22.707
I can't go and live with my mum.

01:45:24.291 --> 01:45:26.457
What can I do to change your mind?

01:45:27.708 --> 01:45:29.165
You can't.

01:45:31.083 --> 01:45:32.957
I've changed my mind
about one thing, though.

01:45:33.083 --> 01:45:34.415
What's that?

01:45:35.291 --> 01:45:37.540
I do want you to remember me.

01:45:38.916 --> 01:45:40.332
Always.

01:45:41.125 --> 01:45:43.749
That I existed,
that I once walked beside you.

01:45:43.875 --> 01:45:45.082
What are you on about?

01:45:46.083 --> 01:45:47.707
Frankie, come on.

01:45:48.541 --> 01:45:49.874
I always imagined, you know,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.207
I thought that we might have
a child or two, you know.

01:45:53.416 --> 01:45:56.290
Why? So you could use them
to threaten me?

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:57.957
No.

01:45:58.833 --> 01:46:00.374
No, because I still love you.

01:46:01.416 --> 01:46:02.874
No.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.374
No, it's just a thing you say
out of loyalty to something

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.915
- that didn't exist in the first place.
- That's not true.

01:46:08.041 --> 01:46:10.832
Loving you is the only thing
that holds me together.

01:46:15.583 --> 01:46:17.290
You know, I...

01:46:17.416 --> 01:46:20.790
I dreamt that we could live
beyond the place we were meant for.

01:46:22.666 --> 01:46:25.374
But you're a gangster
and you love being one.

01:46:25.958 --> 01:46:27.082
No.

01:46:27.208 --> 01:46:29.290
No, Frances, listen.

01:46:31.375 --> 01:46:33.165
Please let me make amends

01:46:33.291 --> 01:46:36.832
for the suffering and the pain
that I have caused you, please.

01:46:37.833 --> 01:46:39.249
Please.

01:46:41.041 --> 01:46:44.082
- Just let me take you somewhere.
- Somewhere?

01:46:44.208 --> 01:46:47.540
Yeah. Anywhere.
Anywhere you want.

01:46:48.791 --> 01:46:51.790
Just the two of us so we can be together.

01:46:52.958 --> 01:46:55.415
It could be like
our second honeymoon or...

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.040
Or not. Just so that you can know
that I can change.

01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:04.207
That... To be fair, I have.
I've... I've changed.

01:47:07.958 --> 01:47:10.415
All I'm saying is
is that the centre of the world

01:47:10.541 --> 01:47:13.499
can be anywhere you want it to be.

01:47:14.208 --> 01:47:15.832

01:47:18.333 --> 01:47:21.124
- Who?
- Ibiza.

01:47:21.250 --> 01:47:23.332
Let's go there,
I like the way the word sounds.

01:47:23.458 --> 01:47:26.165
Yeah, you know what,
I like the way the word sounds, too.

01:47:27.083 --> 01:47:29.457

I'm waiting for Jack the Hat.

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.540
Oh, right.
What's he been doing?

01:58:10.666 --> 01:58:14.124
Has he been waving his shotgun around
in the clubs again?

01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:17.957
What did you think going after
Leslie Payne was going to get us?

01:58:18.083 --> 01:58:20.040
What do I think?

01:58:20.166 --> 01:58:22.207
You heard.

01:58:22.333 --> 01:58:24.082
Well, in case you ain't realised,

01:58:24.208 --> 01:58:27.499
I don't fucking answer to you, sweetheart.

01:58:30.041 --> 01:58:31.957
Now we're back to business.

01:58:32.916 --> 01:58:35.540
Here he is. Come on, come on, Ron,
show us how it's done.

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:37.540
I've got the moves.

01:58:37.666 --> 01:58:41.290
- Hello, hello. Where the birds at?
- Hey, it's Jack the Hat.

01:58:41.416 --> 01:58:44.415
Mr Bender, how are you?
Nice to see you.

01:58:45.416 --> 01:58:46.665
- Esther?
- Jackie.

01:58:46.791 --> 01:58:49.540
I should never have let you go.
That was an absolute mistake.

01:58:49.666 --> 01:58:50.874
I'm gonna get myself a drink.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.832
Then I'm gonna come back, and I'll
tell you why I shouldn't have let you go.

01:58:53.958 --> 01:58:55.415
I promise.

01:58:56.166 --> 01:58:58.124
Hello, Leslie. How are you?

01:59:01.833 --> 01:59:03.790
Ron.

01:59:10.375 --> 01:59:11.874
Teddy.

01:59:12.541 --> 01:59:15.207
There you go, Ron, look. Jack's here.

01:59:15.333 --> 01:59:17.957
What's your stories, morning glories?

01:59:26.958 --> 01:59:29.415
Here you are, Jack. Cigarette.

01:59:29.541 --> 01:59:31.540
I quit on the way down the stairs.

01:59:39.541 --> 01:59:41.582
You got something on your mind, Reg?

01:59:42.541 --> 01:59:44.207
Yeah.

01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:46.499
Yeah, you're on my mind, mate.

01:59:47.125 --> 01:59:48.249
Leslie Payne?

01:59:50.291 --> 01:59:53.665
What the fuck were you thinking?
Eh?

01:59:54.458 --> 01:59:55.707
You've ruined this.

01:59:56.875 --> 01:59:59.999
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Don't fucking lie to me!

02:00:01.958 --> 02:00:04.707
- I don't want to be treated this way.
- How do you want to be treated?

02:00:04.833 --> 02:00:06.249
- Ron?
- Shut up.

02:00:06.375 --> 02:00:09.790
- He ain't gonna fucking help you, is he?
- You got a tin of worms in your head.

02:00:09.916 --> 02:00:12.415
Don't take it out on me
what happened to Frances.

02:00:13.208 --> 02:00:14.540
I'm sorry, what did you say?

02:00:15.208 --> 02:00:18.915
It's not my fault Frances killed herself.
I never sold her the fucking pills.

02:00:19.041 --> 02:00:21.165
You've got to be joking.
Are you fucking joking?

02:00:21.291 --> 02:00:22.374
Reggie.

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:23.999
Go on, fucking shoot him.

02:00:24.125 --> 02:00:26.124
Say that again. Go on.

02:00:26.250 --> 02:00:27.540
Reggie.

02:00:27.666 --> 02:00:30.290
Say her fucking name.
I dare you.

02:00:36.541 --> 02:00:38.415
Frances.

02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:18.374
Why would you do that?

02:01:22.958 --> 02:01:24.582
Because I can't kill you.

02:01:25.458 --> 02:01:28.207
No matter how much I fucking want to.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.665

02:02:06.458 --> 02:02:08.124
Reggie, look at me.

02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:10.374
What the fuck's wrong with you?

02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:13.040
You kill a geezer
in a room full of people.

02:02:13.166 --> 02:02:14.582
Are you fucking mad?

02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:16.915
