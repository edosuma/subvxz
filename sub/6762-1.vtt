01:57.209 --> 02:00.294
So in closing,
l would like to thank every one of you

02:00.463 --> 02:03.334
for your long hours
and unswerving dedication to projects

02:03.508 --> 02:05.251
- that l think were very--
- Andrea, Andrea.

02:05.427 --> 02:06.755
What, Brandon?

02:06.929 --> 02:10.761
Dedication only goes so far.
When that bell rings, we're all history.

02:10.934 --> 02:14.600
Oh, right. Well...

02:14.772 --> 02:17.857
Have a nice summer, everybody.

02:22.491 --> 02:24.567
At Beverly Hills High,
they get out early.

02:24.785 --> 02:27.241
lt's so pointless
to have a last day of school.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.658
Nobody cares.

02:28.832 --> 02:31.038
Kelly, relax.
ln five minutes it will all be over

02:31.210 --> 02:33.333
and you can start working
on your tan.

02:33.505 --> 02:34.536
l can't wait.

02:34.714 --> 02:36.956
l am ready
to have the summer of my life.

02:37.134 --> 02:40.800
- How about you guys?
- l'll settle for interesting.

02:40.972 --> 02:42.596
Bren?

02:42.766 --> 02:44.557
When has summer
not been incredible?

02:44.977 --> 02:47.551
Kelly, you should work
on getting your voice back.

02:58.703 --> 03:00.696
l can't believe it. We're finally free.

03:00.873 --> 03:05.168
An entire summer of nothing
but beaches and babes.

03:05.337 --> 03:06.451
For you, maybe.

03:06.630 --> 03:10.213
l'll be spending the summer
at my grandparents' in Oklahoma.

03:10.385 --> 03:12.508
You'll have fun.

03:12.679 --> 03:16.179
Name one thing fun
about Oklahoma.

03:16.351 --> 03:21.808
l'll bet you not one girl there
has ever met a California stud before.

03:21.983 --> 03:24.059
So generally,
l spend my mornings in the sun

03:24.236 --> 03:25.730
and my afternoon playing volleyball.

03:25.904 --> 03:27.564
Which is cool
because you get a great tan

03:27.740 --> 03:29.234
and a great workout
at the same time.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.900
Plus, it's coed and you meet
the most gorgeous guys.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.653
Doesn't that sound better than
hanging out in some acting class?

03:34.832 --> 03:38.201
- Yeah, well, l have to get my credit.
- And l love acting.

03:38.504 --> 03:40.912
Yeah, but you guys
are totally deserting me.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.332
Besides what cute guy
is gonna take an acting class?

03:43.510 --> 03:46.464
Kelly, can't you ever stop thinking
about guys for one second?

03:46.681 --> 03:48.721
l mean, there is more to life.

03:48.892 --> 03:50.600
Sounds like
it's that time of the month.

03:50.811 --> 03:52.554
Well, it is.

03:53.022 --> 03:55.062
And it isn't,
if you know what l mean.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.608
What are you talking about?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.571
- l'm five days late.
- Oh, my God.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.070
- Brenda, are you sure?
- Kelly, look at me.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.071
l haven't slept in two days.
l keep on checking and waiting.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.863
l don't even know what to do.

04:08.792 --> 04:11.746
So are you finding it tough
to leave this old place?

04:11.921 --> 04:15.171
No, l was just hanging around
to help you clean up a little.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.966
Thanks.

04:17.136 --> 04:21.846
And l wanted to clear things up
between us.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.175
Once summer starts up.

04:24.729 --> 04:27.647
Look, it's no big deal, Brandon.

04:27.816 --> 04:31.150
lt's no big deal
that we almost became a couple?

04:32.197 --> 04:35.447
lt's a little tough to just sweep
under the rug, don't you think?

04:35.660 --> 04:38.780
Look, Brandon, it was a moment
that almost happened but didn't.

04:40.082 --> 04:41.790
So where does that leave us?

04:42.919 --> 04:45.208
As friends, l hope.

04:45.881 --> 04:49.381
l mean, who else can you make
a total fool of yourself in front of, right?

04:49.552 --> 04:50.666
You didn't.

04:52.180 --> 04:53.888
Yeah, l know.

04:54.851 --> 04:57.176
Have a great summer, huh?

04:59.565 --> 05:02.602
Yeah, you too.

05:05.489 --> 05:08.574
You better have fun this summer,
or l'm gonna hear about it.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.661
l'm gonna party
with the best of them, Bran.

05:21.342 --> 05:23.002
Didn't you guys use protection?

05:23.428 --> 05:25.219
Kelly, keep your voice down.

05:25.431 --> 05:26.711
Well, didn't you?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.219
Of course, l'm not stupid.

05:28.393 --> 05:31.228
lt's just that not everything's
1 00-percent effective.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.268
- Well, except, you know.
- What?

05:34.442 --> 05:35.687
Abstinence.

05:35.861 --> 05:39.527
Oh, well, thank you, Donna,
but it's a little bit too late for that now.

05:39.699 --> 05:43.649
This is the only thing that's gonna
give you 1 00-percent peace of mind.

05:43.829 --> 05:46.996
l can't believe l'm taking
a home pregnancy test.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.198
lt's no big deal.

05:48.377 --> 05:51.663
Just think of it as your own
personal little chemistry experiment.

05:51.840 --> 05:54.462
Yeah, except that l'm the guinea pig.

05:57.346 --> 05:58.757
Brenda, are you all right?

05:59.224 --> 06:02.011
l think so. What colour
is it supposed to be again?

06:02.186 --> 06:05.223
Blue for positive, red for negative.

06:07.943 --> 06:09.603
lt's green.

06:09.779 --> 06:11.154
That's impossible.

06:11.323 --> 06:13.529
Well, maybe that means twins
or something.

06:13.701 --> 06:16.073
- Donna, that's not funny.
- Let me see.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.119
l wanna see too.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.665
lt's kind of a pinkish green.

06:21.836 --> 06:24.790
Donna, what colour
does it look like to you?

06:24.965 --> 06:26.708
Honestly?

06:27.093 --> 06:29.418
St. Patrick's Day.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.799
l can't believe this.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.971
l wait to have sex
with a guy that l love.

06:39.608 --> 06:40.983
l act responsibly.

06:41.194 --> 06:43.816
l take every precaution,
and l'm green.

06:44.615 --> 06:46.821
Brenda, maybe you should see
a gynaecologist.

06:51.248 --> 06:53.656
l gotta tell you guys,

06:53.835 --> 06:57.287
l love Dylan and l thought
l knew what l was doing...

06:58.758 --> 07:02.127
...but l'm beginning to get the feeling
that it wasn't worth it.

07:12.150 --> 07:14.439
ls it my imagination, Nat,
or are tips getting smaller?

07:14.611 --> 07:18.146
No, the customers are getting fewer.
lt's the summer, Brandon.

07:18.324 --> 07:20.994
They're all at the beach.
Nobody's eating in town.

07:21.161 --> 07:23.948
So you mean
this is only the beginning?

07:27.461 --> 07:30.035
Let the summer begin.

07:30.214 --> 07:31.922
Hey, bro.

07:32.092 --> 07:33.420
- What's up, bro?
- Not much, bro.

07:33.594 --> 07:36.050
- What time you get off tonight?
- Not till late.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.253
That is beat.

07:37.432 --> 07:40.054
There's the most awesome bonfire
down at the beach tonight.

07:40.269 --> 07:42.096
You should bail out early.
Nat'll let you go.

07:42.271 --> 07:43.646
Yeah, l know,
but l need the money.

07:43.815 --> 07:46.187
lt's the only way l'll get myself
into a new set of wheels.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.938
You definitely need
a new set of wheels.

07:48.112 --> 07:50.437
l know. l found this car
around the corner at the garage.

07:50.615 --> 07:52.157
Mechanic's been working on it
all year.

07:52.326 --> 07:55.530
lt's a '65 Mustang convertible,
it's pristine.

07:55.747 --> 07:57.241
lt's got my name written all over it.

07:57.415 --> 07:58.826
He told me he'd hold it for me.

07:59.001 --> 08:00.994
l just hope l can
scrape together the cash.

08:01.212 --> 08:03.786
- Well, you need a more lucrative job.
- Tell me about it.

08:03.965 --> 08:06.670
l think l made more
lifeguarding at the community pool

08:06.886 --> 08:08.131
last summer in Minnesota.

08:08.304 --> 08:09.418
You were a lifeguard?

08:11.183 --> 08:14.517
- Yeah, don't act so surprised.
- Well, l'm not, but, Brandon,

08:14.729 --> 08:17.137
You should try to get a job
at the Beverly Hills Beach Club.

08:17.316 --> 08:21.564
They pay big money down there
and the fringe benefits are awesome.

08:21.738 --> 08:25.238
- Sounds great.
- Trust me, it is.

08:25.409 --> 08:28.031
- But l don't wanna bail on Nat.
- Nat will survive.

08:28.205 --> 08:31.409
Come on, Brandon, it's time to start
thinking about yourself for once.

08:32.669 --> 08:36.003
- l know, but l--
- But nothing. Nothing.

08:36.173 --> 08:37.916
Let me give you
Henry Thomas' phone number.

08:38.134 --> 08:41.135
lt's Mr. Thomas to you.
He's a manager down there.

08:41.304 --> 08:43.510
Give him a call.
See if anything's available.

08:44.225 --> 08:46.597
l'll put a good word in for you.

08:47.312 --> 08:49.435
Hey, you gonna order or what?

08:49.648 --> 08:53.397
- l hope so. He's my only customer.
- l'll have some water, to go.

08:57.533 --> 09:00.320
- Another school year bites the dust.
- l'll say.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.323
You know,
that's what's so great about school.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.826
Summer actually means something.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.408
lt's the most wonderful season
in the whole world.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.837
Does everything start to lose
its meaning when you get older?

09:10.008 --> 09:11.206
No, that's not what l meant.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.136
lt's just wonderful
to be young and free.

09:14.305 --> 09:17.140
Well, l guess l'm gonna have to wait
until l'm old to appreciate it.

09:17.309 --> 09:19.218
Older.

09:20.437 --> 09:24.898
Mom, how old were you when you
went to see your first gynaecologist?

09:25.068 --> 09:27.773
Well, l guess not until college.

09:27.947 --> 09:30.782
- For what?
- Well, l--

09:30.951 --> 09:34.736
- What's prompting all this?
- Nothing. l'm just curious.

09:34.914 --> 09:37.999
l mean, l'm gonna have to go
see one sometime, aren't l?

09:39.545 --> 09:44.006
Well, l guess l went because
l thought it was a good idea.

09:44.176 --> 09:46.216
A good idea for what?

09:46.387 --> 09:48.961
Brenda, is there something
you're not telling me?

09:49.141 --> 09:51.383
Can't l ask a question
without getting the third degree?

09:51.560 --> 09:52.591
Well, of course.

09:52.770 --> 09:56.305
l just hope that if there were
something wrong, you would tell me.

09:56.483 --> 09:58.855
- Well, nothing's wrong.
- What's wrong?

09:59.070 --> 10:00.529
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

10:00.697 --> 10:05.194
- Sorry l asked. Dylan's here.
- l didn't even hear the bell.

10:05.369 --> 10:07.492
- Bye. Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.

10:07.664 --> 10:10.784
Just because it's summer
doesn't mean that curfew's changed.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.202
l wish l was on vacation.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.622
Come here.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.926
Damn, Bren, l don't believe it.
l mean, how?

10:21.098 --> 10:23.589
Dylan, l thought you said
that we did everything right.

10:23.768 --> 10:25.725
Yeah, we did.

10:25.896 --> 10:29.894
- l knew it was a mistake.
- lt was wonderful.

10:30.067 --> 10:32.737
Bren, it was great.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.868
Dylan, what if l'm pregnant?

10:37.535 --> 10:41.485
Then l'll do everything l can
to help you and support you.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.786
Bren, it's my problem too.

10:45.587 --> 10:48.043
lt doesn't feel that way.

11:02.442 --> 11:04.850
Good morning,
gentlemen and ladies.

11:05.446 --> 11:08.020
We are looking for three lifeguards.

11:08.199 --> 11:12.149
This is a full-time position,
five or six days a week,

11:12.329 --> 11:18.415
excellent pay and wonderful benefits
and very hard work.

11:18.587 --> 11:22.716
Now, l assume you've all been trained
and experienced in beach rescue.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.458
Lake rescue.

11:26.389 --> 11:28.880
- Excuse me?
- Lake and pool, sir.

11:29.059 --> 11:30.886
Well, that doesn't concern me, son.

11:31.103 --> 11:32.977
What you put down here,
l don't care about.

11:33.148 --> 11:35.639
lt's what you do out there
that l care about.

11:36.443 --> 11:39.610
Now, everybody,
show me what you've got.

11:39.781 --> 11:42.486
Let's start with a series of
ten sprints,

11:42.701 --> 11:44.777
out to those two orange poles
out there

11:45.413 --> 11:46.658
and back.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.998
Ready.

12:01.892 --> 12:04.562
l really feel weird about being here
without my mother.

12:04.980 --> 12:07.815
Brenda, you could have told her.
My mother would have understood.

12:07.983 --> 12:10.059
Well, mine wouldn't, believe me.

12:10.236 --> 12:13.688
You know, l didn't even wanna ask her
the name of her own gynaecologist.

12:13.866 --> 12:17.116
Trust me,
Dr. Strathmore is the best.

12:17.287 --> 12:19.529
l know.
l just hate meeting new doctors.

12:19.707 --> 12:22.625
Well, my mom and l
have been seeing him for years.

12:22.794 --> 12:25.083
l really wish he wasn't a him.

12:25.255 --> 12:27.248
Most gynaecologists are.

12:30.595 --> 12:33.430
- Oh, my God.
- What?

12:33.641 --> 12:35.349
What are those?

12:35.518 --> 12:37.724
You've never seen
a pair of stirrups before?

12:37.938 --> 12:40.014
Not unless they're on a horse.

12:40.191 --> 12:42.599
lt's just the way they examine you.

12:42.778 --> 12:43.976
How wonderful.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.941
Brenda, would you mind giving us
a urine sample?

12:47.116 --> 12:49.322
The bathroom's right across the hall.

12:49.494 --> 12:53.955
- Sure.
- l'll just be outside with Dylan.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.955
All right, come on, let's go.
Move it, move it.

12:59.173 --> 13:00.584
Push it, come on.

13:00.759 --> 13:04.840
All right, come on, come on.
Push it out, push it out, let's go.

13:08.393 --> 13:10.967
That wasn't too bad, was it?

13:12.023 --> 13:13.185
See that buoy?

13:13.817 --> 13:16.735
Everybody hit the water
for a half-mile swim, now let's go.

13:16.904 --> 13:20.154
Come on, let's move it. Move it!

13:23.454 --> 13:25.612
Hi there.
You must be Brenda Walsh.

13:25.790 --> 13:27.783
- Hi.
- So let's see. You're here--

13:27.960 --> 13:30.166
Dr. Strathmore,
you may not believe this.

13:30.338 --> 13:33.339
- What's that?
- l think l'm okay now.

13:33.717 --> 13:35.425
Since when?

13:35.595 --> 13:38.466
- l guess since l got here.
- Are you sure?

13:38.640 --> 13:39.920
Definitely.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.425
Look, l'm sorry
for wasting your time.

13:42.603 --> 13:44.014
You haven't wasted any time at all.

13:44.189 --> 13:46.680
You know, it's perfectly normal
to be late occasionally.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.519
l know,
l've just never been late before.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.817
- But what a relief.
- For the moment.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.737
You know, Brenda, when a woman
becomes sexually active,

13:53.909 --> 13:57.528
she's got to start dealing with a whole
new set of responsibilities.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.366
Yeah, l'm beginning to realise that.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.960
You ever been examined
by a gynaecologist before?

14:03.588 --> 14:04.868
No.

14:05.049 --> 14:06.627
Why don't we set up
another appointment?

14:06.801 --> 14:09.471
Never too early to start. Maria?

14:17.731 --> 14:19.059
Bren, what happened?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.398
- How'd it go?
- Everything okay?

14:21.570 --> 14:25.022
- Yeah, everything's fine.
- What did he say?

14:25.199 --> 14:26.942
Can we just go now?

14:27.118 --> 14:30.867
- lt was a total false alarm, right?
- Yes, totally.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.033
Yes.

14:33.251 --> 14:34.793
Bren...

14:35.921 --> 14:38.673
While we're here, do you think
maybe it'd be a good idea

14:38.841 --> 14:42.922
if you would see about the doctor
putting you on the pill?

14:43.097 --> 14:46.098
You think it's that easy,
don't you, Dylan?

14:46.268 --> 14:49.518
l just pop a pill and then you don't have
to worry about anything?

14:49.689 --> 14:54.316
- No, l was thinking about you.
- No, you weren't.

14:54.486 --> 14:56.942
You were thinking about yourself.

15:03.247 --> 15:05.572
l don't get it. What did l do?

15:05.751 --> 15:08.123
You're just being a total guy.

15:08.796 --> 15:10.420
Brenda...

15:18.600 --> 15:19.679
There he is. l see him.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.189
Should l go out there
and bring him in?

15:24.358 --> 15:25.686
No.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.567
He'll be all right.

15:29.698 --> 15:31.192
l wanna thank you for coming.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.614
lt's gonna be a tough decision,
but l have your numbers

15:33.786 --> 15:36.075
and l'll be notifying everyone
by the end of the day.

15:36.289 --> 15:38.745
Hey, thanks a lot. Take care.

15:47.387 --> 15:51.172
- Walsh, you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.600
l guess l'm just more
of a pool-guard type, huh?

15:54.771 --> 15:55.802
l see.

15:55.981 --> 15:58.555
Well, it's a good thing
l've got another job to fall back on.

15:58.734 --> 16:01.059
- What's that?
- l work at the Peach Pit.

16:01.238 --> 16:04.572
lt's a burger joint in town.
l've been working there all year.

16:04.742 --> 16:07.743
l just thought it might be nice to come
here and make a little more money

16:07.913 --> 16:09.906
and get a tan while l was at it.

16:10.082 --> 16:11.909
But l guess not, huh?

16:12.752 --> 16:15.587
Listen, Mr. Thomas,
thanks for the opportunity.

16:15.756 --> 16:18.591
lt's the best workout l've had
all year.

16:19.636 --> 16:21.296
Hey, Walsh.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.760
l got a position open
for a cabana boy.

16:26.937 --> 16:28.930
With tips, you can make
as much as a beach guard.

16:29.148 --> 16:32.352
- Really? What would l have to do?
- A little bit of everything.

16:32.569 --> 16:35.487
Set up lounge chairs, carry drinks,
keep the peace.

16:35.656 --> 16:38.230
Everything except
save our members from drowning.

16:39.119 --> 16:41.575
- l think l can probably handle that.
- l think you can too.

16:41.789 --> 16:44.161
That's why l'm offering you the job.

16:44.334 --> 16:46.077
That's outstanding.
When would l start?

16:46.295 --> 16:47.873
Tomorrow, 7 a.m. sharp.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.382
Tomorrow?

16:51.551 --> 16:53.378
l should really give Nat,
the guy l work for,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.381
two weeks' notice, don't you think?

16:55.557 --> 16:57.099
Walsh...

16:57.684 --> 16:59.262
...in about 1 5 minutes,

16:59.436 --> 17:03.351
l'm gonna interview
35 prospective cabana boys.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.521
l got resumes,
letters of recommendation,

17:06.695 --> 17:08.238
high school transcripts,

17:08.448 --> 17:11.568
modelling portfolios,
and the truth of it is,

17:11.785 --> 17:13.243
l hate to interview people.

17:13.413 --> 17:16.450
So if you want the job, it's yours.
Effective immediately.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.911
Otherwise, l meet the competition.

17:21.673 --> 17:25.007
Well, you know, things have been
kind of slow over there lately

17:25.176 --> 17:27.383
and l guess Nat would understand.
He should understand.

17:27.556 --> 17:31.008
Well, that's between you and Nat.

17:32.019 --> 17:34.391
Listen, Mr. Thomas.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.478
Thanks for the opportunity.

17:38.069 --> 17:41.319
- l'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

17:53.338 --> 17:56.339
- Hey there, recycling parent.
- Hi, Brandon.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.917
Well, it's good to see
someone's trying to save the planet.

17:59.096 --> 18:01.504
- Where have you been?
- You're not gonna believe this, Mom,

18:01.682 --> 18:04.683
but l just scored the most righteous job
of the summer.

18:04.895 --> 18:07.053
l'll be a cabana boy
at the Beverly Hills Beach Club.

18:07.231 --> 18:08.725
Everybody who's anybody
belongs there

18:08.900 --> 18:11.605
and all l gotta do is make sure
they're having a good time.

18:11.778 --> 18:14.150
Sounds wonderful, but what
about your job at the Peach Pit?

18:14.323 --> 18:15.983
Well, Nat'll understand.

18:16.159 --> 18:18.864
How could he stand in the way
of an opportunity like this?

18:19.037 --> 18:21.789
lt sounds like he's not gonna have
much choice. When do you start?

18:21.958 --> 18:23.333
Tomorrow.

18:23.501 --> 18:26.668
- Aren't you gonna give him notice?
- l really can't, Mom.

18:26.881 --> 18:28.957
They need me to start right away.

18:29.134 --> 18:32.254
l'll get Brenda to fill in for me
until he can find a replacement.

18:32.471 --> 18:35.093
Brenda has summer school.

18:40.064 --> 18:41.262
Hey, beautiful sister.

18:41.983 --> 18:44.557
Why do l get the sneaking feeling
that you want something?

18:45.154 --> 18:47.610
No, no, not at all.

18:48.366 --> 18:51.985
ln fact, l wanna do you a favour.

18:52.163 --> 18:55.164
l just got offered this incredible job
at the Beach Club for the summer,

18:55.334 --> 18:58.086
but l need someone
to take over for me at the Peach Pit.

18:58.254 --> 18:59.582
Now, before you get too excited,

18:59.756 --> 19:02.674
it's only for a couple weeks
until Nat can find--

19:07.057 --> 19:08.088
Bren, you've been crying?

19:08.308 --> 19:09.850
No.

19:10.019 --> 19:12.689
Come on, Bren, l know when you're
upset. Your cheeks get flushed.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.643
What is it?

19:21.492 --> 19:24.327
You know how things
seem really important...

19:25.956 --> 19:28.328
...and you go out and do them...

19:29.752 --> 19:33.252
...and then you can't even remember
what you got so worked up about?

19:33.424 --> 19:34.455
Yeah.

19:38.305 --> 19:41.888
Well, l always thought
that l wanted a really cool boyfriend.

19:43.186 --> 19:46.887
And to not be one of the last people
to have sex.

19:48.693 --> 19:51.267
Well, l have a cool boyfriend
and we've had sex.

19:52.656 --> 19:54.115
And God knows l'm not the last.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.816
ln fact, l'm beginning to wonder
if l'm one of the first.

19:59.790 --> 20:01.498
And...

20:03.420 --> 20:05.247
And what?

20:08.468 --> 20:11.672
And up until a couple of hours ago,
l thought that maybe l was pregnant.

20:16.019 --> 20:18.012
- Oh, Brenda.
- l'm not, of course.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.472
Otherwise, l wouldn't be so calm.

20:21.693 --> 20:23.520
l guess l just overreacted.

20:23.737 --> 20:26.193
No, no, not at all.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.569
l understand how you feel.

20:33.708 --> 20:34.739
Sort of.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.671
Well, not really.

20:42.219 --> 20:45.220
Everybody talks about sex
like it's no big deal.

20:45.390 --> 20:46.932
And it is a big deal.

20:47.351 --> 20:52.228
Hey, it's all right, come here.
lt's okay. lt's okay. You're okay.

20:52.732 --> 20:55.936
l know.
lt's just changed things, that's all.

20:59.032 --> 21:00.859
Do Mom and Dad
know anything about this?

21:02.161 --> 21:05.198
Are you kidding?
They would freak out.

21:05.499 --> 21:08.286
Brandon, promise me
that you won't tell them.

21:10.046 --> 21:11.789
Are you sure?
l think they can handle it.

21:12.007 --> 21:13.121
Brandon, please.

21:14.886 --> 21:16.428
Okay.

21:17.806 --> 21:18.968
l promise.

21:30.197 --> 21:34.112
Hey, who's mixing paper
with the plastic?

21:42.045 --> 21:44.287
Oh, my God.

21:52.934 --> 21:56.220
l think you guys
are really misunderstanding.

21:56.397 --> 21:57.891
ls it yours?

21:58.065 --> 21:59.725
Did you use this test?

21:59.901 --> 22:01.063
Where did you find it anyway?

22:01.236 --> 22:03.442
l mean, l didn't know this family
was spying on trash.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.939
Honey, l wasn't spying.
You had it wrapped in plastic.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.193
l was separating the trash
for recycling.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.618
Brenda, we're not angry with you.

22:10.790 --> 22:13.032
We just wanna know
what's going on.

22:14.002 --> 22:15.461
l am so embarrassed.

22:16.297 --> 22:18.088
Honey, we don't want you
to feel that way.

22:18.258 --> 22:19.882
We just want you to be able to feel

22:20.052 --> 22:22.626
that you can discuss these things
with us.

22:23.556 --> 22:25.015
l know.

22:26.977 --> 22:30.726
For a moment there,
l thought that maybe l was pregnant.

22:30.899 --> 22:34.600
My period was a few days late
so l got worried.

22:38.742 --> 22:44.164
Well, did you do something
that would give you reason to believe

22:44.332 --> 22:46.906
that if you were a few days late

22:47.086 --> 22:49.873
that that would indicate
that you were pregnant?

22:50.924 --> 22:52.548
You mean like sex?

22:53.052 --> 22:54.879
Yes, something like that.

22:55.096 --> 22:56.210
Yes, of course.

22:57.599 --> 23:00.007
Well, how long
has this been going on?

23:00.353 --> 23:03.853
Brenda, having sex means
making a very serious commitment.

23:04.066 --> 23:06.474
- And at your age--
- lt's a big responsibility, Brenda.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.523
And l just wish that you had
discussed it with us first.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.196
Or if you didn't feel comfortable
with me, with your mother.

23:12.410 --> 23:13.988
All right.

23:15.455 --> 23:18.125
The first time l did it
was two weeks ago with Dylan.

23:19.043 --> 23:20.703
Where?

23:20.920 --> 23:23.494
ln the hotel where the dance
was being held.

23:23.674 --> 23:26.344
l mean, are you guys happy
now that you know everything?

23:26.511 --> 23:28.420
- Brenda, l warned you about him.
- Jim.

23:28.639 --> 23:30.263
Dad, don't blame this on Dylan.

23:30.433 --> 23:32.426
lt was something
that we both wanted to do.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.767
l see. As two consenting teenagers?

23:34.980 --> 23:36.604
- Yes.
- Brenda.

23:37.859 --> 23:41.193
The point is, yes,
physically, you're ready.

23:41.363 --> 23:44.364
But that doesn't necessarily mean
that you are emotionally.

23:44.534 --> 23:46.776
Well, l think l am.

23:49.415 --> 23:50.957
l just wonder if,
five years from now,

23:51.125 --> 23:53.533
you're gonna look back
and think the same thing.

23:58.009 --> 24:00.465
Didn't you and Dad have sex
before you were married?

24:04.142 --> 24:06.300
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

24:06.478 --> 24:08.387
Are you and Dylan planning
to get married?

24:08.606 --> 24:09.981
No.

24:10.567 --> 24:12.939
Why do you guys
wanna make me feel so bad?

24:14.071 --> 24:16.313
Oh, honey, we're not trying
to make you feel bad.

24:16.491 --> 24:21.237
We just want you to realise
that in this day and age, especially,

24:21.414 --> 24:22.694
sex is not a game.

24:23.124 --> 24:25.615
No matter how it may look
in movies and on TV.

24:25.794 --> 24:27.372
lt's serious.

24:27.547 --> 24:29.623
And it doesn't make you an adult.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.211
Good.

24:31.385 --> 24:33.128
Because l don't wanna be an adult.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.090
That must be Dylan. l'm supposed
to go out with him tonight.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.763
Good. l wanna talk to him too.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.348
- Don't you dare.
- Jim.

24:42.566 --> 24:44.144
Dad, you're not his father.

24:44.443 --> 24:45.605
Brenda is right.

24:45.778 --> 24:47.272
l'll kill myself if you say one word.

24:47.447 --> 24:49.855
l don't want him to know
that you know.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.864
Hey, Bren. How are you?

24:58.586 --> 25:00.875
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hi.

25:01.882 --> 25:05.002
Bren, why do you have that box
in your hand?

25:05.804 --> 25:09.090
Hi, Dylan. Don't stay out too late.

25:10.601 --> 25:13.851
l swear to God we won't.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.658
God, l heard myself out there
sounding exactly like my father

25:24.828 --> 25:26.655
when l was Brenda's age.

25:26.830 --> 25:30.365
Conservative, moralizing,
completely inflexible.

25:30.543 --> 25:35.253
- All the things l swore l'd never be.
- Jim, it was a big shock.

25:35.424 --> 25:37.832
Thank God she's not pregnant.

25:38.011 --> 25:40.051
l like to think of myself
as open-minded.

25:40.222 --> 25:42.892
lt's hard when it comes
to your own kids.

25:43.059 --> 25:45.135
l feel the same way.

25:46.063 --> 25:49.848
So, what do we do?

25:50.026 --> 25:52.398
Make ground rules about sex?

25:52.571 --> 25:56.106
lf we forbid her, you know
she'll run out and do exactly that.

25:56.701 --> 25:58.610
There's no answer.

26:01.457 --> 26:03.200
Jim, the answer is
we're just going to have

26:03.377 --> 26:06.331
to put a lot of trust in our daughter.

26:14.015 --> 26:16.221
- Hey, Nat.
- Hey, Brandon.

26:16.393 --> 26:19.063
You just can't get enough
of this place, huh?

26:19.230 --> 26:23.228
See, the food's so good around here
even the help comes on their off days.

26:24.904 --> 26:28.653
What would you like?
Anything you want, on the house.

26:28.867 --> 26:32.153
On the house? l've never heard
those words pass your lips before.

26:32.372 --> 26:35.741
What can l tell you?
l'm in a generous kind of mood.

26:36.293 --> 26:39.247
Listen, Nat.
l gotta talk to you about something.

26:39.756 --> 26:40.918
Shoot.

26:43.219 --> 26:44.464
You know how much l love you

26:44.637 --> 26:46.464
and you know how much l love
working here.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.345
Brandon, l just can't.

26:50.061 --> 26:52.599
- What?
- Give you a raise.

26:52.814 --> 26:55.519
l mean, you know how much our
business is slashed in the summer.

26:55.735 --> 26:58.855
- lt happens every year.
- l know that, Nat.

26:59.948 --> 27:01.228
That's why l gotta quit.

27:02.410 --> 27:04.652
- What?
- You see, l got this other job.

27:04.830 --> 27:07.072
lt's a really great job
at the Beverly Hills Beach Club.

27:07.291 --> 27:09.118
l'm gonna be a cabana boy there.
You know,

27:09.294 --> 27:11.370
setting up beach chairs,
serving drinks,

27:11.546 --> 27:13.373
helping ladies with their suntan oil.

27:14.216 --> 27:17.420
Brandon, that-- That sounds great.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.589
This dump can't compare, huh?

27:19.765 --> 27:21.923
No, no, it doesn't have
anything to do with that.

27:22.978 --> 27:25.730
This other job pays more
and l need the money.

27:26.065 --> 27:28.603
l gotta have a car this fall.

27:28.985 --> 27:30.894
Brandon...

27:31.071 --> 27:34.903
...l've never been a person to stand
in the way of another guy's success.

27:36.912 --> 27:39.118
Thanks, Nat.
l'm glad you feel that way.

27:39.290 --> 27:44.332
- l was kind of worried.
- So when does this new job start?

27:48.009 --> 27:51.959
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

27:52.140 --> 27:55.177
Brandon, l said we were slow,
but we're not dead.

27:55.352 --> 27:57.179
l can't run this place by myself.

27:57.396 --> 27:59.389
l know, Nat.
You'll find somebody. l'll help you.

27:59.566 --> 28:01.108
But by tomorrow?

28:01.318 --> 28:04.355
Do you have any idea
how many yutzes there are out there?

28:04.530 --> 28:07.448
Brandon, it's gonna take me
a couple of weeks to find somebody,

28:07.618 --> 28:10.536
- and then l gotta train them.
- Nat, l'm sorry.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.283
One day's notice.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.702
Gee, divorce me,
but don't desert me, kid.

28:18.632 --> 28:21.752
- l don't know what to say.
- Say?

28:21.927 --> 28:23.920
Say you'll stay
until l find a replacement.

28:24.139 --> 28:28.007
Nat, l can't. l told them that l'd...

28:28.185 --> 28:29.763
Okay.

28:30.313 --> 28:31.937
Okay, l understand.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.400
Hey, kid, it's been a lot of fun
working with you,

28:36.571 --> 28:38.943
and you have yourself
a good summer, huh?

29:05.399 --> 29:07.688
Bren, what's wrong?

29:07.861 --> 29:09.141
Everything.

29:09.321 --> 29:12.026
lt's not the end of the world.
Your parents will get over it.

29:12.325 --> 29:14.068
Yeah, maybe.

29:14.244 --> 29:16.118
They shouldn't have made you
feel guilty, Bren.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.912
That's not fair.

29:18.082 --> 29:20.288
Dylan, they didn't.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.951
Believe it or not, this has nothing to do
with my parents.

29:23.130 --> 29:27.045
lt's just the icing on the cake.

29:27.219 --> 29:32.178
l understand. You had a bad scare.
l don't blame you for being upset.

29:33.059 --> 29:36.013
lt just made me think
about a lot of things.

29:37.064 --> 29:39.816
Do you know how lucky l feel
that l met someone like you?

29:40.026 --> 29:41.734
l feel lucky too.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.786
When we first started going out,

29:47.953 --> 29:49.744
l thought you were so sewy.

29:50.957 --> 29:55.252
lt was so exciting how we flirted
and everybody looked at us.

29:57.924 --> 30:00.498
And then l fell in love with you.

30:00.678 --> 30:03.300
And l fell in love with you.

30:05.016 --> 30:07.388
And l trusted you enough

30:07.561 --> 30:09.601
to have sex
when l've said no before.

30:11.191 --> 30:12.851
l know.

30:14.362 --> 30:16.319
What are you saying?

30:18.701 --> 30:22.651
l just feel like we've crossed
an imaginary line.

30:23.582 --> 30:25.206
lt all feels too much right now.

30:25.376 --> 30:28.911
Worrying about condoms
and birth-control pills

30:29.089 --> 30:31.295
and seeing a gynaecologist,
and getting pregnant

30:31.467 --> 30:35.002
- and what my parents are thinking.
- Come here.

30:39.519 --> 30:40.978
ls it getting too scary?

30:41.646 --> 30:43.057
l just don't know what we're about,

30:43.232 --> 30:46.150
like things are happening too much,
too fast.

30:50.741 --> 30:53.861
l think we need to stop seeing
each other, at least for a while.

30:55.414 --> 30:56.493
Bren, you're overreacting.

30:56.665 --> 30:58.373
Stop worrying about
what your parents think

30:58.543 --> 30:59.918
and figure out what you feel.

31:00.128 --> 31:02.798
l have. l know what l'm feeling.

31:03.007 --> 31:05.878
No, you don't. Everything you told me
so far only adds up to one thing:

31:06.052 --> 31:10.050
You're afraid.
That's not enough of a reason.

31:10.850 --> 31:13.851
Dylan, l do know what l'm feeling.

31:14.021 --> 31:15.895
And l need to break up with you.

31:17.358 --> 31:18.936
No.

31:21.071 --> 31:23.229
No.

31:23.867 --> 31:26.073
Dylan, l'm sorry.

31:46.020 --> 31:49.187
- Mom? Dad?
- Hi, honey.

31:49.357 --> 31:50.768
l have an announcement to make.

31:52.194 --> 31:53.854
What is it?

31:54.280 --> 31:56.023
Dylan and l broke up last night.

31:56.867 --> 31:59.405
Oh, honey, you didn't have to
break up with Dylan.

31:59.579 --> 32:01.904
- That's not what we were saying.
- l know that.

32:02.123 --> 32:05.872
lt's just that things have gotten
more serious than l really wanted.

32:06.045 --> 32:09.165
l guess, at the moment, l'm just
not ready for a sexual relationship.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.770
Brenda, don't you think
you're overreacting just a bit?

32:24.944 --> 32:27.269
Kelly, it's just not that.
l mean, it's a lot of things.

32:27.489 --> 32:30.609
- l don't understand.
- You don't have to.

32:30.826 --> 32:33.946
l guess l just wanted
to be my own person again.

32:34.122 --> 32:36.578
At least for a while.
l mean, it's not a crime, is it?

32:36.792 --> 32:39.248
Well, maybe not to the LAPD.

32:39.421 --> 32:41.959
- How did he take it?
- Not so well.

32:42.132 --> 32:43.507
Well, guys never do.

32:43.718 --> 32:45.093
Doesn't matter how cute they are.

32:46.388 --> 32:48.464
What do l say to him
if l see him at the beach?

32:48.849 --> 32:50.343
Nothing.

32:50.518 --> 32:52.226
l'm sure he hates me right now.

32:52.854 --> 32:55.226
God, what a way
to start the summer, huh?

33:01.031 --> 33:02.525
Yo, Dylan.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.408
Hey, B.

33:04.578 --> 33:07.116
What brings you back to the beach?

33:07.289 --> 33:10.160
Didn't Brenda tell you?
l got a job here for the summer.

33:10.335 --> 33:12.743
- No, it must have slipped her mind.
- lt's incredible, man.

33:12.922 --> 33:14.665
l get to hang out in the sun
all summer long

33:14.841 --> 33:16.584
and l make more than l did
at the Peach Pit.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.595
Yeah? How does Nat feel
about you leaving?

33:19.764 --> 33:23.264
Well, that was the only bummer.
He didn't take it so well.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.059
Yeah, why not?

33:25.229 --> 33:27.186
l guess because l had to start
right away.

33:27.357 --> 33:28.519
l didn't give him any notice.

33:28.692 --> 33:32.108
Well, you Walshes have a way
of dumping on people.

33:32.279 --> 33:33.607
What's that supposed to mean?

33:34.657 --> 33:36.281
Nothing.

33:36.451 --> 33:39.025
Man, the guy's your friend.
You gotta show him some respect.

33:39.247 --> 33:40.278
Yeah, l know.

33:40.456 --> 33:42.781
lf l didn't start today,
l would've lost out on this gig.

33:43.127 --> 33:45.535
Big deal. B, l've been
a member here all my life, man.

33:45.713 --> 33:47.706
The place is not worth
selling your soul for.

34:00.065 --> 34:02.437
So, Bren, what are you gonna do
on Saturday nights?

34:02.610 --> 34:07.356
- Donna, Dylan was not my life.
- God, you are so brave.

34:10.453 --> 34:11.697
Hey, Brenda, Donna.

34:11.871 --> 34:14.029
Andrea, l didn't know
you were taking drama class.

34:14.248 --> 34:16.123
You don't have to sound
so surprised.

34:16.293 --> 34:18.085
No, it's just that
you didn't say anything.

34:18.295 --> 34:21.380
l thought l'd be spending most of
the summer at this children's shelter,

34:21.550 --> 34:25.335
but then l realised that l had
my mornings free, so here l am.

34:25.554 --> 34:28.722
- Cool.
- Plus, l had to spice up my resume.

34:28.935 --> 34:31.722
Colleges love diversity and
they like to know you can have fun.

34:32.231 --> 34:36.016
l need to spice up my resume too,
like with a quick A.

34:36.235 --> 34:39.023
Good morning, good morning.
Sorry l'm late.

34:39.364 --> 34:41.192
- Who's that?
- l don't know.

34:41.367 --> 34:43.360
l thought Ms. Kapuchnick
was teaching this class.

34:43.536 --> 34:44.568
Yeah, so did l.

34:44.746 --> 34:47.533
l hit the most incredible traffic
on the 405.

34:47.833 --> 34:48.864
l'm Chris Suiter.

34:51.088 --> 34:53.579
And let me tell you
a little about myself.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.759
Born, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
1 967,

34:56.929 --> 34:59.966
son of a civil engineer, Ted Suiter,
and his lovely wife, Sue Anne,

35:00.141 --> 35:02.383
a former Southern belle
from South Carolina.

35:03.020 --> 35:04.977
They met and fell in love at UVA

35:05.189 --> 35:07.680
and got married May 1 2th, 1 959.

35:07.859 --> 35:08.890
Neither family approved,

35:09.069 --> 35:13.150
but out of that blessed union
came Ned, Roxanne and finally Chris.

35:13.783 --> 35:16.488
A child who grew up
not unlike any other child,

35:16.704 --> 35:19.195
except when he announced
the terrifying news at the age of 1 8

35:19.374 --> 35:21.248
that he wanted to be an actor.

35:21.919 --> 35:24.837
Months of begging, pleading
and sound beatings to the head

35:25.006 --> 35:26.666
did nothing to dissuade him.

35:27.092 --> 35:31.042
He applied to Northwestern University's
Theatre Department and was accepted.

35:31.514 --> 35:33.388
Years of torturous study,

35:33.892 --> 35:35.885
small roles in great plays

35:36.103 --> 35:38.641
and large roles in lousy plays
followed.

35:39.608 --> 35:42.182
Graduation loomed
and Broadway beckoned,

35:42.361 --> 35:44.852
where, on his first meeting
with a casting director, was told:

35:45.156 --> 35:46.531
''Find another line of work.''

35:47.368 --> 35:49.574
He agreed. So in the great tradition

35:49.746 --> 35:51.454
of ''those who cannot do, teach,''

35:51.623 --> 35:55.039
l humbly present myself to you,
your esteemed drama teacher.

35:56.713 --> 35:58.421
You may call me Mr. Suiter.

35:58.590 --> 36:01.959
And what l've just delivered,
you may call a monolog.

36:04.681 --> 36:07.718
Which was greeted
by a deafening silence.

36:07.935 --> 36:10.093
Who else would like to give it a try?

36:10.522 --> 36:11.802
Come on, hey, it's easy.

36:11.982 --> 36:14.022
Just your life's story
in one minute or less.

36:15.236 --> 36:17.063
Thank you.
Thank you, dark-haired girl

36:17.239 --> 36:18.982
with the beautiful smile
for volunteering.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.575
- No.
- Yes.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.451
- No.
- Yes, come on.

36:22.621 --> 36:24.364
Come on, what's your name?

36:24.540 --> 36:26.449
- Brenda. Yes.
- Brenda? Great.

37:24.282 --> 37:28.280
All right, if l nail this next point,
l get to take you out for lunch, okay?

37:29.497 --> 37:32.284
- Nineteen serving 20.
- Steve.

37:32.459 --> 37:35.330
Time out.
Kelly, can't you see l'm trying to serve?

37:35.505 --> 37:36.667
- Did you hear?
- What?

37:36.840 --> 37:38.500
Brenda broke up
with Dylan last night.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.331
You're kidding.

37:40.553 --> 37:42.676
Have you seen him?
l mean, is he okay?

37:42.889 --> 37:44.597
Come on,
they've been going out for months.

37:44.766 --> 37:46.094
They were bound to go bust.

37:46.268 --> 37:48.510
l'm sure he's ecstatic
that she's finally cut him loose.

37:49.481 --> 37:51.141
You're so romantic, Steve.

37:54.320 --> 37:58.105
Do-over, 1 9 serving 20.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.573
Now, look,
if you wanna get along with me,

38:03.749 --> 38:07.083
you will remember that every weekday
between 1 1 and 1 2,

38:07.253 --> 38:10.040
The Young and the Restless.
No interruptions. You got it?

38:10.507 --> 38:12.001
- Yeah, l got it.
- Cool.

38:12.510 --> 38:15.428
Oh, before l forget,
there's your uniform.

38:18.142 --> 38:19.850
Thanks.

38:21.438 --> 38:24.854
But l don't think l'm gonna be able
to wear it for about a week.

38:25.443 --> 38:27.317
Why, are you expecting
a growth spurt?

38:27.738 --> 38:31.783
No. lt's just l can't dump on
my former employer like this.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.486
l can't understand why you'd want
somebody like that

38:34.663 --> 38:35.861
working for you anyway.

38:36.082 --> 38:38.752
Someone of such little integrity.

38:38.918 --> 38:41.076
See, the bottom line is, Mr. Thomas,

38:41.296 --> 38:42.790
l'll promise to give this job my all

38:42.965 --> 38:46.584
if you'll just allow me to give Nat
the courtesy of a week's notice.

38:50.517 --> 38:52.510
Who is this Nat?

38:53.312 --> 38:55.554
He's a really great guy.

38:57.484 --> 39:00.936
You see, l'd never leave you
without giving you some notice.

39:01.489 --> 39:02.948
l gotta do the right thing.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.570
Mr. Walsh...

39:06.996 --> 39:08.704
...you better be worth waiting for.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.369
Now, get out of here.

39:11.543 --> 39:13.417
Thanks.

39:15.965 --> 39:19.132
So l moved from Minnesota
to Beverly Hills,

39:19.345 --> 39:22.180
which was definitely a shock
that l finally got over

39:22.349 --> 39:24.306
because l met
some incredible friends.

39:25.644 --> 39:29.808
lncluding a great guy named Dylan
who l fell totally in love with.

39:31.110 --> 39:33.482
But our relationship got too intense
for both of us

39:33.655 --> 39:35.813
and we broke up last night.

39:37.368 --> 39:38.779
l'm always the last to know.

39:41.289 --> 39:43.614
So how does that make you feel,
Brenda?

39:44.710 --> 39:45.908
Kind of sad, l guess.

39:46.337 --> 39:48.579
Great. Great, what else?

39:50.259 --> 39:53.426
- Kind of alone.
- Terrific. What else?

39:53.597 --> 39:55.305
- Confused.
- Wonderful.

39:55.516 --> 39:59.561
- Why is it wonderful? l feel miserable.
- lt's wonderful because you're feeling.

39:59.729 --> 40:01.852
And that is the most important part
of acting.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.110
So embrace all of your feelings,
no matter what they are,

40:05.320 --> 40:07.313
because they are what make you,
number one, human,

40:07.489 --> 40:09.980
and number two,
and even more importantly,

40:10.159 --> 40:11.190
a good actor.

40:14.832 --> 40:17.454
- Yes?
- Are we gonna be graded on this?

40:19.630 --> 40:21.124
Hey, Nat.

40:21.298 --> 40:23.006
Hey, Brandon.

40:23.176 --> 40:25.418
l didn't expect to see you
until you were much tanner.

40:25.595 --> 40:27.753
Yeah, l know.

40:28.182 --> 40:31.516
Listen, Nat,
l'm sorry for bailing on you like that.

40:31.687 --> 40:34.522
Hey, you did what you had to do.

40:34.690 --> 40:36.848
Well, l was wrong.

40:38.070 --> 40:41.155
Yeah, but let's let bygones
be bygones.

40:41.365 --> 40:42.396
- Right?
- Wrong.

40:42.575 --> 40:44.733
l told the guy at the beach club
l'd give you a week.

40:44.953 --> 40:47.740
- Otherwise, he could take his job--
- No, no, no, hold on.

40:47.915 --> 40:50.786
- l found someone already.
- You did?

40:50.961 --> 40:54.165
Don't look so surprised.
This joint ain't that bad.

40:54.382 --> 40:58.167
Well, no. lt's not that. l...
l just didn't wanna leave you hanging.

41:00.056 --> 41:03.093
You didn't, and l appreciate it.

41:03.268 --> 41:05.011
Come here, you.

41:06.022 --> 41:08.976
- You have yourself a good summer.
- All right. You too.

41:09.151 --> 41:11.357
- Okay.
- Thanks, Nat.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.278
All right.

41:13.490 --> 41:16.277
And then l won the ninth-grade
scholastic achievement award

41:16.493 --> 41:19.031
which led to a finalist position
in the state-wide competition,

41:19.205 --> 41:21.363
which l never
ever, ever, ever, thought l'd win,

41:21.583 --> 41:23.623
but did, due to this essay
on perestroika

41:23.794 --> 41:27.294
which predated most of the reforms
by almost a year.

41:29.009 --> 41:31.002
Okay, we'll pick this up again
tomorrow.

41:31.179 --> 41:34.513
- Thank you.
- Oh, sure.

41:39.773 --> 41:42.608
God, l was so nervous up there
talking to everybody.

41:42.777 --> 41:44.105
Andrea, you were fine.

41:44.279 --> 41:46.901
Oh, God, l'm terrified that tomorrow,
when l talk about my life,

41:47.074 --> 41:49.197
that l'll be done
in about two seconds.

41:49.368 --> 41:51.159
Wait, do you think
l can make something up?

41:56.920 --> 42:00.170
- l'll see you guys later, okay?
- Brenda, what's wrong?

42:04.513 --> 42:06.636
Dylan alert.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.685
- Catch you tomorrow, huh?
- Sure.

42:18.364 --> 42:21.365
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:22.410 --> 42:24.818
l'm feeling bad, Bren.

42:24.997 --> 42:28.532
- Me too.
- So why are you doing it?

42:29.795 --> 42:31.206
Dylan, l need some time.

42:32.757 --> 42:34.666
You know,
l thought if we ever broke up,

42:34.843 --> 42:38.093
l would feel this
tremendous sense of relief.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.589
l could go back to being myself.

42:40.767 --> 42:45.311
But something happened.
l fell in love with you or something.

42:45.773 --> 42:47.730
And l stopped being a loner.

42:49.278 --> 42:51.436
Dylan, l think that's wonderful.

42:51.614 --> 42:53.571
l think it's terrible.

42:54.368 --> 42:58.069
The only person in this world
that l have to depend on is me.

42:58.247 --> 42:59.741
And l always have to remember it.

42:59.958 --> 43:02.116
Dylan, that's not true.

43:02.294 --> 43:03.574
You can depend on me.

43:03.796 --> 43:05.207
Oh, really?

43:07.092 --> 43:10.296
Dylan, just because l need some time
and a break,

43:10.471 --> 43:12.131
doesn't mean
that l still don't love you,

43:12.307 --> 43:14.050
or that this isn't painful for me too.

43:14.685 --> 43:17.889
Well, maybe that's what they mean
when they say ''love hurts.''

43:19.107 --> 43:22.975
Dylan, l got so close it scared me.

43:23.154 --> 43:24.897
l don't wanna be scared with you.

43:29.287 --> 43:30.865
l know.

43:34.627 --> 43:37.877
lf we're meant to be together,
time will tell.

43:42.929 --> 43:44.922
Can l take you home?

43:47.477 --> 43:48.591
No.

43:51.273 --> 43:53.431
l think l should walk.

43:55.529 --> 43:57.071
Goodbye, Dylan.
