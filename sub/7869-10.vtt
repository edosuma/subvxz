10:40.107 --> 10:41.706
so I can have
a girls' night out?

10:41.708 --> 10:45.243
Sure, I'll stay home and
Skype with the guys at Moe's.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.811
Hey, how you doing, Home...

10:46.813 --> 10:49.414
(distorted buzzing)

10:49.416 --> 10:51.282
Stupid Flanders' Wi-Fi.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.718
(grunts)
Uh, that wasn't the Wi-Fi.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.754
My Bell's palsy's acting up.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.222
(distorted buzzing)

10:57.224 --> 11:01.292
Yeah, it can be tough, but,
you know, I try to stay posit...

11:01.294 --> 11:03.028
(distorted buzzing)

11:03.030 --> 11:04.129
(volume lowering)

11:04.131 --> 11:06.998
(buzzing fades)

11:07.668 --> 11:09.734
I've been dying
to try it.

11:09.736 --> 11:13.004
Marge, who are you cutting
up that chicken for?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.472
The kids aren't here.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.776
Huh? Oh. Myself, I guess.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.778
Who's kicking?

11:19.780 --> 11:20.912
No one. No one's kicking.

11:20.914 --> 11:25.116
Sorry. I'm just not used
to everyone behaving.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.017
Oh, Marge.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.019
If you don't have a life
outside your kids,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.721
how do you expect to be happy?

11:29.723 --> 11:31.790
I've got a great idea.
From now on,

11:31.792 --> 11:35.126
the four of us will get
together every Tuesday.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.062
Go out on a Tuesday?

11:37.064 --> 11:39.030
Who am I, Charlie Sheen?

11:40.233 --> 11:43.001
Fine, I'll do it.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.039
Oh...

11:48.041 --> 11:50.141
(gasps)

11:53.480 --> 11:55.847
Oh...

11:59.753 --> 12:02.353
(humming jaunty tune)

12:02.355 --> 12:03.922
(gasps)
Oh...

12:03.924 --> 12:06.324
"Ion." Hmm.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.792
(gasps)
No.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.194
"Irene Ryan is (gasps)

12:09.196 --> 12:10.895
(tires squeal)
TV's Granny."

12:10.897 --> 12:13.531
(car door closes)
MARGE: Thanks for the ride!

12:13.533 --> 12:15.233
(vehicle drives away)
Hmm? (chuckling)

12:15.235 --> 12:17.836
This is late for Marge.
I assume.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.337
I've never been home
at this hour.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.438
(Santa's Little Helper barking)

12:20.440 --> 12:23.141
MARGE:
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh!

12:24.478 --> 12:26.478
Hey, Marge.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.847
Partaking of the grape, were we?

12:28.849 --> 12:32.383
(slurring):
Just a little Merlot...

12:32.385 --> 12:35.787
Mmm...
You want to stay up
and talk a while?

12:35.789 --> 12:38.790
Are you sleepy?
I'm not sleepy.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.725
(laughing)

12:41.161 --> 12:43.862
And Anita's family
rented a beach house,

12:43.864 --> 12:44.596
and guess what?

12:44.598 --> 12:46.965
They went to the
beach every day.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.466
Oh, great.
That's great.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.302
But I have to get
to work in the morning.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.471
But I don't want
a beach house.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.206
Sand makes me sad

12:55.208 --> 12:57.242
because it used
to be big rocks.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.444
But not anymore.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.546
Not anymore...

13:01.548 --> 13:05.049
(both sobbing)

13:09.089 --> 13:12.557
Kind of weird,
us all being naked in here.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.492
(sighs)
We're not naked.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.861
Right. Neither am I.

13:21.935 --> 13:25.503
Listen, any of you guys
want to play Old Maid?

13:25.505 --> 13:28.540
Don't be a wuss.
We all did it.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.574
Chicken!

13:29.576 --> 13:31.843
(all clucking)

13:37.851 --> 13:39.717
(all clucking)

13:39.719 --> 13:42.153
If I do it,
you're supposed to stop!

13:42.155 --> 13:43.588
Don't tell a chicken
when to cluck.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.057
You're not the chicken,
I'm the chicken!

13:46.059 --> 13:48.126
Chicken!
(all clucking)

13:48.128 --> 13:50.328
(groans)

13:52.132 --> 13:54.766
Ooh, three!

13:55.769 --> 13:56.601
Bart?

13:56.603 --> 13:57.335
Hey.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.336
(coughing)

13:58.338 --> 14:00.171
They dared me to see
how many TV remotes

14:00.173 --> 14:01.339
I could stick
in my mouth.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.309
We've got to stop Mom
from going out with those women.

14:04.311 --> 14:08.313
Something drove them apart
once before.

14:08.315 --> 14:12.116
And I bet it has something
to do with this scar.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.919
I've seen
this mark before.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.355
On you,
every time you come in.

14:17.357 --> 14:17.722
(laughing)

14:17.724 --> 14:20.558
I believe it had something
to do with Comic Book Guy.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.093
Comic Book Guy? Thanks.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.528
Listen. Are you going
to see him now?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.129
You can give him
some news for me.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.932
Tell him it's
the worst prognosis ever.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.834
(laughing)

14:32.072 --> 14:34.105
Oh! I knew
this day would come.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.242
Although frankly, I thought it
would have been a long time ago.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.544
You are very uncurious
about your body.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.047
All right, Comic Book Guy.
Tell me my origin story.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.350
I will not relive
the horror of that day!

14:45.352 --> 14:46.351
The answer is "no,"

14:46.353 --> 14:48.553
and I can say it
in Na'vi or Klingon,

14:48.555 --> 14:50.121
which are pretty
much the same.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.256
I have some theories on that

14:51.258 --> 14:53.524
which I will share
with you never.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.926
You leave me no choice.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.495
I hold in my hands
a mint-condition copy

14:57.497 --> 15:01.032
of the legendary
Interesting Stories Number 27.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.269
Oh! Oh, the first appearance
of Radioactive Man.

15:04.271 --> 15:08.039
And if you don't tell us
what we want to know...

15:10.610 --> 15:11.709
(cries out)

15:11.711 --> 15:14.512
How do I know that is not
a cheap reprint?

15:14.514 --> 15:17.048
Are you willing
to take that chance?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.950
Yes.

15:22.022 --> 15:22.820
No! No! No!

15:22.822 --> 15:24.589
I'll tell you
what you want to know.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.590
Could we hurry
this up?

15:25.592 --> 15:29.294
I am really uncomfortable
being a girl in this store.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.295
Very well.
I shall tell you

15:30.297 --> 15:33.197
what happened to you and your
friends several years ago.

15:33.199 --> 15:37.368
But for you to understand it,
I must go back a little further.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.040
Our story begins with the
creation of Middle Earth,

15:42.042 --> 15:45.009
as recounted in the Ainulindal
and the Valaquenta.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.946
Behold Melkor,
proudest of the Ainu!

15:47.948 --> 15:50.615
Look, pal,
we've gotta speed this up.

15:51.251 --> 15:55.753
Fine. Children just want to know
what is and not why it is.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.255
(slurping)

16:01.761 --> 16:05.596
Your scar, like Tom Cruise's
last good movie,

16:05.598 --> 16:08.499
was born on
the Fourth of July.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.667
<i>It was seven years ago,</i>

16:09.669 --> 16:11.936
<i>a time when "twilight" meant</i>
<i>the end of the day</i>

16:11.938 --> 16:16.274
<i>and not the most barftastic</i>
<i>horror franchise of all time.</i>

16:18.011 --> 16:19.277
(crying)

16:19.279 --> 16:22.380
(confused jabbering)

16:22.682 --> 16:27.986
<i>Earth's single sun was setting,</i>
<i>and the Mayor began to speak...</i>

16:27.988 --> 16:31.422
Even though most of this town
collaborated with the British,

16:31.424 --> 16:36.060
and we are still in informal
talks to return to their empire,

16:36.062 --> 16:38.229
we all love fireworks!

16:38.231 --> 16:39.297
CROWD:
Yay!

16:39.299 --> 16:41.599
<i>Traditionally,</i>
<i>the Fourth of July fireworks</i>

16:41.601 --> 16:43.835
<i>were operated by the person</i>
<i>most likely</i>

16:43.837 --> 16:45.303
<i>to be sober and dateless.</i>

16:45.305 --> 16:48.573
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>the honor fell to me.</i>

16:49.676 --> 16:51.242
(boom)

16:51.244 --> 16:52.477
(cheering)

16:52.479 --> 16:55.146
This is your TV
for the year, kids.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.182
And the embers is your dinner.

16:59.219 --> 17:03.254
(explosions, crowd exclaiming)

17:07.861 --> 17:09.227
<i>While I was busy tending to</i>

17:09.229 --> 17:11.029
<i>a critical matter</i>
<i>of great delicacy,</i>

17:11.031 --> 17:15.700
<i>you and your diaper-wearing</i>
<i>droogs ruined everything!</i>

17:19.239 --> 17:22.206
(explosions)

17:22.208 --> 17:23.408
(crowd gasping)

17:23.410 --> 17:26.077
(panicked shouts)

17:26.746 --> 17:28.179
(gasps)

17:32.085 --> 17:33.451
(boom)

17:33.453 --> 17:35.420
(scorching hiss)

17:35.422 --> 17:36.687
(boys cry out)

17:36.689 --> 17:39.424
(groans)

17:39.426 --> 17:41.092
And that is when
the four of you

17:41.094 --> 17:43.828
each received
the mark of the sword.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.729
Hmm.

17:44.731 --> 17:49.534
Every Fourth of July
I remember that fallen hero.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.736
God, how I miss you.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.673
So, what's the plan again?

17:55.675 --> 17:58.609
I go to see those other guys,
we blow this junk up,

17:58.611 --> 18:02.113
once again Mom decides that
they're a bad influence on me,

18:02.115 --> 18:05.283
and she stops seeing those
women who make her so happy.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.117
(gasps)

18:06.119 --> 18:07.452
What are you boys doing?

18:07.454 --> 18:10.555
Uh, we're doing
a project on...

18:10.557 --> 18:13.291
uh, uh, uh...
the subject of...

18:13.293 --> 18:15.526
something pertaining to...

18:15.528 --> 18:16.427
here it comes...

18:16.429 --> 18:18.596
Milhouse, I'm getting
tired of waiting.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.832
Can I go home and
think of a lie?

18:20.834 --> 18:22.800
Yes, you may.

18:23.169 --> 18:23.634
Mom...

18:23.636 --> 18:27.638
I'll admit it: I wanted to
create a devastating explosion

18:27.640 --> 18:29.373
to get back my mom.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.876
Aw, Bart, sweetie...

18:31.878 --> 18:34.312
I love you kids
with all my heart,

18:34.314 --> 18:36.814
but damn it,
I need something for myself!

18:36.816 --> 18:39.183
I made you a coffee mug
on Mother's Day!

18:39.185 --> 18:40.485
Isn't that enough?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.787
It's close, but no.

18:45.425 --> 18:50.294
I could light these,
but it wouldn't be the same.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.299
(laughing)

18:55.301 --> 18:56.234
Well, I've put it off

18:56.236 --> 18:59.704
but today I'm finally getting
this garage organized.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.171
(loud explosion)

19:00.173 --> 19:02.840
HOMER (dazed):
Guess I'll put these tools away.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.443
Hang 'em on hooks and such.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.379
So Bart,
the little dickens,

19:08.381 --> 19:11.516
was gonna set off an explosion
to break us up.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.851
Can you believe it?
(giggles)

19:13.853 --> 19:16.354
Actually, we
can believe it.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.455
What are you talking about?

19:17.457 --> 19:20.391
Your son always was the
bad apple of the bunch.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.394
You know nothing about my son

19:23.396 --> 19:25.630
and even less about apples.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.331
(gasps)

19:27.467 --> 19:29.200
(gun cocks, fires)

19:31.704 --> 19:35.339
I remember why I left this group
seven years ago,

19:35.341 --> 19:38.409
and it's why I'm leaving now.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.911
Good day, ladies.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.748
Well, since she's gone...

19:43.750 --> 19:45.082
(all giggle)

19:45.084 --> 19:47.585
Come here, you.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.622
Sorry you broke up
with your friends, Mom.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.659
Oh, I think they were
never my friends.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.195
Maybe true friends
aren't random people

19:57.197 --> 19:59.463
you meet at a
Mommy-and-Me class.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.600
They're random people
you meet in a college dorm.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.268
Maybe Lisa and I
can be friends.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.671
Not with each other,
but with you.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.772
Oh...

20:07.774 --> 20:09.840
Ow!
Ah!

20:09.842 --> 20:10.474
Grr.

20:10.476 --> 20:13.477
Hey, does Dad know you
and the cool moms broke up?

20:13.479 --> 20:16.714
Well, Homer got along so well
with the other dads,

20:16.716 --> 20:18.849
I couldn't break it to him.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.322
Oh. Can we at least
drink beer or something?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.657
Why do you keep
trying to engage us?

20:26.659 --> 20:27.892
Hey-diddily-hi, Homer.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.360
Oh, you beautiful man!

20:29.362 --> 20:33.497
Oh... that feeling
is Mutual of Omaha.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.200
God, you're hilarious.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.848
Shh!
