Good evening, everyone.

37:14.620 --> 37:16.210
I know y'all are eager
to go home.

37:16.210 --> 37:17.960

37:19.790 --> 37:21.420
She could be waiting

37:21.420 --> 37:23.460
But what?
Look at Audrey.

Not one bead of sweat.
Not one stutter.

of Staff is about to resign.

Mellie's problem is that

With what evidence?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.080
We have a recording

we just have a recording.

It's not enough to prosecute
Olivia for Quinn's murder.

39:31.620 --> 39:32.830
The best
we can do now
