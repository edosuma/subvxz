00:03.590 --> 00:07.150
Earl, I need you to drive over toJoy's
and punch her in the face.

00:07.260 --> 00:09.630
I don't think that's a good idea, Randy.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.560
Are you sayin' that
because it's a <i>great</i> idea?

00:13.670 --> 00:16.660
- She did it again, didn't she?
- Uh-huh.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.670
And it was a real fancy bird.

00:21.410 --> 00:24.570
<i>[Earl Narrating] Randy had invested</i>
<i>a lot ofhis time and my money...</i>

00:24.680 --> 00:27.170
<i>into the Crab Shack claw machine.</i>

00:27.280 --> 00:29.720
- I won a horse!
- Who won a horse?

00:29.820 --> 00:32.580
- <i># Mattie told Hattie #</i>
- <i>But thanks toJoy,</i>
<i>he didn't have much to show for it.</i>

00:32.690 --> 00:35.550
<i>#About a thing she saw #</i>

00:35.660 --> 00:38.420
- I won a spider!
- <i>I will take that. Thank you.</i>

00:38.530 --> 00:43.190
<i>#And a woolyjaw</i>
<i>Wooly bully #</i>

00:43.300 --> 00:46.600
I won a bird dressed up for a wedding.
You're not gettin' it.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.930
- <i># Wooly bully #</i>
- Catch.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.770
- <i># Wooly bully #</i>

00:57.950 --> 00:59.850
<i>Randy, you're 32 years old.</i>

00:59.950 --> 01:02.180
I can't protect you
from your bullies forever.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.310
You need to learn to stick up for yourself.
Joy's not goin' anywhere.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.580
- She's part of our lives.
- Man!

01:07.690 --> 01:10.210
I'm always gonna regret
givin' her that Heimlich.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.420
I mean, first she sued me, and now this?

01:12.530 --> 01:14.860
Look, I know I go overboard
lookin' out for you...

01:14.960 --> 01:16.860
but I'm not doin' it anymore.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.020
And while we're at it, I'm not kissin'
your boo-boos anymore either.

01:20.130 --> 01:22.500
- It's gettin' awkward.
- Even when we're alone?

01:22.600 --> 01:24.800
Especially when we're alone.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.570
<i>You know the kind of guy</i>

01:29.680 --> 01:32.370

01:32.480 --> 01:35.940
<i>Well, that was me. Every time</i>
<i>somethin'good happened to me...</i>

01:36.050 --> 01:38.520

01:42.090 --> 01:44.390
<i>That's when I realized I had to change.</i>

01:45.830 --> 01:48.290
<i>So I made a list of everything bad</i>
<i>I've ever done...</i>

02:03.940 --> 02:06.110
- <i>'cause it reminded me of something on my list.</i>
- [Randy] Hmmm.

02:10.220 --> 02:13.740
Hmmm.

02:13.850 --> 02:16.620
Randy, this tantrum
is gettin' out of control.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.990
<i>Here we go. Number 32-</i>
<i>bullied Wally Panzer.</i>

02:21.100 --> 02:23.000
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>When I was in the eighth grade...</i>

02:23.100 --> 02:26.830
<i>my parents made a last-ditch effort</i>
<i>to fix me- Catholic school.</i>

02:26.930 --> 02:30.200
<i>I knew that the new kid at school</i>
<i>usually got picked on...</i>

02:30.300 --> 02:32.330
<i>unless there was someone</i>
<i>lower on the totem pole than him...</i>

02:32.440 --> 02:35.310
<i>so I decided to make that happen.</i>

02:35.410 --> 02:37.310
[Grunts]

02:40.650 --> 02:42.310
[Screaming]

02:42.420 --> 02:45.390
That kid loves butterflies.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.720
And he hates when they die.

02:47.820 --> 02:50.450
<i>Wally Panzer? More like Wally Pansy.</i>

02:50.560 --> 02:52.720
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>And once I smelled blood in the water...</i>

02:52.830 --> 02:54.920
<i>I didn't let up.</i>

02:55.030 --> 02:57.360
- [Laughing]
- Hey, everyone, look.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.400
It's Pants-less Pansy.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.230
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>But, like most things in life, I pushed it too far.</i>

03:02.340 --> 03:04.430
- [Chanting] Pansy! Pansy! Pansy!
- <i>Even though I got kicked out...</i>

03:04.540 --> 03:06.440
<i>my legacy lived on.</i>

03:06.540 --> 03:09.840
<i>Wally wasn't hard to find since if you</i>
<i>hadn't left Camden by grade school...</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:12.430
<i>odds are you weren't</i>
<i>leaving Camden at all.</i>

03:12.550 --> 03:15.670
Okay, the way I remember it,
this guy was pretty delicate as a kid...

03:15.780 --> 03:17.680
so try to be as friendly as possible.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.680
I don't want to spook him.

03:25.660 --> 03:29.490
- What do you want?
- Uh, are you, uh, Wally Panzer?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.000
Yeah. Who are you?

03:33.530 --> 03:35.830
- Cliff.
- You here about my ad in <i>The PennySaver?</i>

03:35.940 --> 03:37.770
- Mm-hmm.
- Awesome.

03:37.870 --> 03:40.530
I hope you're ready for some pain.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.840
I'm gonna get my belt.

03:42.940 --> 03:45.540
Man, you must be scared.
You forgot your name.

03:45.650 --> 03:48.580
I didn't forget my name, Randy.
I just don't want him to know who I am.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.780
Why is he gettin' his belt?

03:51.890 --> 03:54.350
That's what Dad used to say.
Are we gonna get spanked?

03:54.450 --> 03:56.250
I guess it depends on what's in his ad.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.190
Why don't you just tell him
why you're here?

03:58.290 --> 04:00.990
Because if I tell him who I am,
he'll probably kill me.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.290
I'm gonna have to try
to cross him off the list...

04:03.400 --> 04:05.300
without him ever knowin' who I am.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.700
We're just gonna have to
take our chances with the ad.

04:07.800 --> 04:12.030
- What if his ad is sex?
- I hope it's not sex.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.300
All right. You guys ready to pump?

04:16.940 --> 04:20.310
Oh, God. He does want
to have sex with us.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.320
"Us"? You. Cliff answered the ad.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.080
Come on. Let's hit the gym.

04:25.190 --> 04:28.450
Ahhh. We're gonna work out together.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.360
Awesome. I hope this gym has group showers
like the ones we had at school.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.090
I want to show everybody I have hair now.

04:35.230 --> 04:39.170
<i>[Earl Narrating] I wasn't sure how</i>

04:45.170 --> 04:47.070
What the hell'd you do that for?

04:47.170 --> 04:49.070
To get us pumped!

04:49.180 --> 04:51.340
Come on, Cliff. Hit me back.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.350
Go ahead.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.310
Good.
[Grunts]

04:59.420 --> 05:03.450
<i>Wally was so hard-core, he'd already</i>

Come on, Cliff. Push it.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.990
You can do it. Two more. It's all you.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.690
How about a little less me and-
[Spits] a little more you?

05:14.030 --> 05:16.700
- Here we go.
- [Groans]

05:18.240 --> 05:20.430
It slipped. I'll get it.

05:20.540 --> 05:23.740
- Come on.
- What do you say we take a quick break?

05:25.480 --> 05:27.470
So I figured if I got big and strong...

05:27.580 --> 05:29.520
my bully would leave me alone.

05:29.620 --> 05:33.050
How long do I have to bounce on this thing
before I look like you guys?

05:33.150 --> 05:35.820
You wanna really get ripped,
you gotta work with some free weights.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.950
Good. 'Cause I don't have any money.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.050
Don't worry, man. We'll buff you out.

05:41.160 --> 05:44.360
[Chuckles]
So, uh, how big is your bully?

05:45.470 --> 05:48.630
About this tall...

05:48.740 --> 05:50.670
this wide and...

05:50.770 --> 05:52.670
about a 32 "C."

05:54.310 --> 05:56.800
Wait. Your bully's a girl?

05:56.910 --> 05:58.970
Really tough girl-

05:59.080 --> 06:01.340
32 "C."

06:01.450 --> 06:03.850
Dude, if your bully's a girl,
it's not about how big you are.

06:03.950 --> 06:05.850
It's about confidence.

06:07.590 --> 06:12.680
What you need is 100% pure shark
adrenaline. It'll turn you into a beast.

06:12.790 --> 06:16.490
You'll destroy everyone and everything
that gets in your way.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.430
Especially baby seals.

06:19.530 --> 06:22.930
Mmm, man. What I wouldn't give
for a baby seal right now.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.900
- [Grunts]
- Cool. So what's it taste like?

06:26.010 --> 06:29.240
Uh, the drugs, not the baby seal.
I know what those taste like.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.940
Oh, you don't drink this.
You inject it into your scrotum.

06:33.050 --> 06:34.710
Yeah.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.280
[Screaming]
Oh, my God!

06:40.390 --> 06:42.550
That's my scrotum?

<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>Mr. Camden, huh?</i>

07:08.580 --> 07:10.550
<i>Pretty big deal.</i>

07:10.650 --> 07:13.280
I was there when Mr. Camden 1998
cut the ribbon...

07:13.390 --> 07:16.050
at the opening ceremony
of the new welfare office.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.150
Me and my brother were third in line.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.620
Ah, the Mr. Camden competition is stupid.

07:20.730 --> 07:22.750
Stupid? Really?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.960
Look at all this stuff you can win.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.330
You could get a month's worth
of somethin' called DVD rentals...

07:28.440 --> 07:30.930
an office-quality paper shredder...

07:31.040 --> 07:33.370
and a gift certificate
for all you can eat sushi...

07:33.470 --> 07:36.840
from Sensei Yum Yum's.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.470
Okay, fine. Yes, of course I wanna win.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.480
It's always been a dream of mine.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.570

I'm not willin' to do.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.880
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Wally told me competin'in Mr. Camden...</i>

07:59.400 --> 08:03.170

08:03.270 --> 08:05.700
I don't care if that contest
comes with a talking pet monkey.

08:05.810 --> 08:08.040
It ain't worth
turnin' myself into a pansy.

08:08.140 --> 08:12.640
<i>I knew something was wrong, 'cause no man</i>
<i>would turn down a talking pet monkey.</i>

08:12.750 --> 08:15.940
<i>Then I realized- Me callin' Wally a pansy</i>
<i>when we were kids...</i>

08:16.050 --> 08:18.310
<i>was stoppin'him</i>
<i>from trying to be Mr. Camden.</i>

08:20.750 --> 08:22.280
Randy, you're not gonna believe
what just happened.

08:22.390 --> 08:23.820
I was just gonna say the same thing.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.020
I know how I can cross Wally off my list.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.620
I'm gonna help him get over his fear so
he can win the Mr. Camden competition.

08:29.730 --> 08:31.990
See ya later, buddy.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.500

08:34.600 --> 08:36.500
Look, I've been thinkin'.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.600
You're the biggest, strongest guy
I've ever seen. You should be Mr. Camden.

08:40.710 --> 08:45.040
It just makes sense, like how the biggest,
strongest peanut became Mr. Peanut.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.880
- What?
- It's true. Don't you ever read the jar?

08:47.980 --> 08:51.680
Cliff, dudes like me and you-
We don't do all that pansy stuff.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.220
We wear flannel. We have body hair.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.350
We really like soups that are so hearty,
you eat them with a fork.

08:57.460 --> 09:00.650
Are you kiddin'? I'm totally gonna
do all that bodybuilder stuff...

09:00.760 --> 09:02.660

I don't know, Cliff.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.630
Come on. W-We'll do it together.

Two men shavin', tannin',
oilin' each other up.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.710
We won't talk about it. We'll just do it.

All right.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.690
If a man's man like you

Hot damn. I'm gonna be Mr. Camden.

Relax, Randy. We're just

11:10.790 --> 11:13.850

11:17.400 --> 11:19.870
Tell him, Cliff. We're not pansies.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.990
"Cliff"? You still
stickin' with that name?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.000
You haven't told him who you really are?

Wh-Wh-What are you talkin' about, Randy?

11:27.170 --> 11:30.200
L-I am who I am. I'm Cliff.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.970
Man, I don't know which one of you
is a bigger pansy-

11:33.080 --> 11:35.140
Wally for actually bein' a pansy...

11:35.250 --> 11:38.410
or you for bein' too afraid
to tell him your real name...

11:39.520 --> 11:41.450
Earl.

11:42.990 --> 11:45.890
- Wait a minute. Earl?
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>

[Stammering]
I guess Cliff is more-more of a nickname.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.600
But-But look, I can explain.

11:58.710 --> 12:01.870
I always dreamed I'd

- Shark adrenaline.

Well, just, uh-Just give me a second.

- It's a karma list. It's really hard to explain.

- I was just trying to help.
- By making me look like a pansy?

12:53.760 --> 12:55.390
- [Squealing] No!
- [Grunts]

<i>It took me 20 minutes to get into my car...</i>

<i>stop Randy before he killed somebody...</i>

- Hey! Where's the guy who did this?

<i>he couldn't change the sweetness inside</i>
<i>he was trying to protect.</i>

<i>the bodybuilder and the little kid</i>
<i>who loved butterflies.</i>
