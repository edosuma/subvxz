12:40.500 --> 12:41.542
[yells]

12:41.625 --> 12:48.083
-Ah, the actress I sent for.
-So, sabotaging your own film!

12:48.166 --> 12:51.750
Admit it now, and maybe the police
will go easy on you.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.709
No need to audition, young lady.
You've already got the part.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.583
Montgomery,
get her into costume, immediately!

12:57.667 --> 13:01.542
You won't get away with this!
Causing accidents--

13:01.625 --> 13:04.667
[groans]
Actresses are so temperamental.

13:10.667 --> 13:16.000
-You'll never get away with this!
-Hey, just stick to the script, OK?

13:19.709 --> 13:21.583
[yelling]

13:23.417 --> 13:25.083
That girl's a natural.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.625
Boy, how'd she get a part?

13:29.709 --> 13:30.625
Cut!

13:35.667 --> 13:40.500
Why do I always have to repeat myself?
I said cut!

13:40.583 --> 13:43.583
-Cut!
-Help!

13:44.542 --> 13:47.208
-[Rebecca] Stop!
-Pretty please?

13:48.250 --> 13:50.166
[yelling]

13:53.083 --> 13:57.750
Gee, maybe the director
wasn't the one causing the accidents.

13:58.959 --> 14:02.458
Do you want another take, CB?
Huh? Do you? Huh? Huh?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.291
Hey, over there!
It's the... [groans]

14:05.375 --> 14:09.166
Beck, you're crushing the flowers
I got for Kiki.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.792
Baloo, look, whoever that
mysterious figure was,

14:12.875 --> 14:14.750
is causing the accidents.

14:14.834 --> 14:18.375
Accidents?
Oh, right. The accidents.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.625
-Come on, pal, we'd better go find--
-Balooie, here I am.

14:23.417 --> 14:26.375
For me?
Come, poopsie.

14:26.583 --> 14:32.083
Kiki's going to take her baby bear out
for a final... fabulous meal

14:32.166 --> 14:35.625
before he flies his big, important stunt.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.667
Baloo, you can't go!
You have to listen to me!

14:38.750 --> 14:42.583
Hey, simmer down.
We can talk later.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.417
Later? You might not have a later.

14:45.500 --> 14:49.625
You'll have to excuse her.
She skipped lunch.

14:49.709 --> 14:52.458
Fine, Baloo. Don't listen to me.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.667
But someone's causing these accidents,

14:54.750 --> 14:57.125
and I'm going to find out who it is.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.917
Even if I have to guard
your stunt plane all night.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.500
I'm doing this for you, Baloo,
wherever you are.

15:06.625 --> 15:10.583
[both laughing]

15:11.959 --> 15:16.667
Excuse me for a moment, sugar loaf.
I'm going to go freshen up.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.667
Of course.
Take your time.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.208
[owl hooting]

15:21.291 --> 15:23.000
[snoring]

15:23.083 --> 15:24.417
[tapping]

15:24.500 --> 15:25.542
What?

15:26.041 --> 15:27.500
Hey, you!

15:29.041 --> 15:33.417
Come back here, you...
you Starrywood saboteur!

15:48.250 --> 15:49.625
[squeaking]

16:01.750 --> 16:04.417
[laughing ominously]

16:09.750 --> 16:11.834
Ooh, ooh!

16:11.917 --> 16:13.417
[yells]

16:19.000 --> 16:21.458
[panting]

16:29.000 --> 16:30.083
[yells]

16:33.000 --> 16:33.959
[grunting]

16:34.041 --> 16:35.125
Get off of me!

16:35.208 --> 16:37.000
[mumbling]

16:37.792 --> 16:38.875
[gasps]

16:39.250 --> 16:40.959
It's you!

16:44.041 --> 16:48.792
It's you! You've been the one
causing all the accidents.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.959
Yes, yes, it was I.

16:52.041 --> 16:53.125
Buy why?

16:53.208 --> 16:57.792
You... you wouldn't understand.
[crying]

16:57.875 --> 17:01.417
It's... it's all so terrible.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.583
So is your acting.

17:03.125 --> 17:06.500
All right, so,
my last two pictures flopped big,

17:06.583 --> 17:08.040
and my career's on the skids.

17:08.125 --> 17:13.208
I need publicity to put me back on top.
It's as simple as that.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.959
Now, if you'll excuse me.

17:16.040 --> 17:19.959
You risked all those
people's lives for a movie?

17:20.040 --> 17:23.165
Hey, that's show biz.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.165
Well, I'm not going to let you
risk Baloo's life!

17:26.250 --> 17:28.208
I'm gonna tell him everything!

17:28.290 --> 17:30.125
Go ahead, darling.

17:30.208 --> 17:34.500
But I've got that big dumb galoot
wrapped around my little finger.

17:34.583 --> 17:37.542
Who do you think he'll believe,
me or you?

17:37.625 --> 17:41.375
Baloo and I are friends!
He'll believe me!

17:41.458 --> 17:43.542
Places, everybody!

17:44.959 --> 17:46.917
I don't believe you.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.667
See? Told you so.

17:49.750 --> 17:53.208
Ready for the big stunt,
Baloosie-woosie?

17:53.291 --> 17:56.083
Oh, anything, Kiki.

17:56.166 --> 17:59.750
But I saw her sabotage
the plane myself, Baloo.

17:59.834 --> 18:03.291
Sabotage, smabotage.
Jealousy, more like it.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.583
-Now simmer down, Becky, and--
-It's Rebecca!

18:06.667 --> 18:11.333
Well, fine,
but I'm doing this stunt for Kiki. Got it?

18:11.417 --> 18:15.166
-Stunt crew at the ready!
-That's my cue.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.625
Break a neck... leg, baby bear.

18:21.125 --> 18:25.834
-But Baloo!
-Hey, let go of my leg, lady.

18:25.917 --> 18:30.041
Look, Baloo, as a friend,
don't fly this stunt.

18:30.125 --> 18:33.625
But we aren't friends anymore,
are we, Rebecca?

18:33.709 --> 18:36.291
What is holding up this stunt?

18:36.375 --> 18:39.625
All right.
I won't stand in your way.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.208
Great.
[grunts]

18:41.291 --> 18:44.250
-My megaphone!
-[Baloo] Hey! Who turned out the lights?

18:44.333 --> 18:47.959
Sorry, Baloo, but I am your friend.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.291
-Anybody!
-My megaphone, give it back!

18:51.375 --> 18:54.542
That crazy dame is stealing my stunt.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.542
Action, action!
Special effects!

18:57.625 --> 19:01.417
I'm a friend, and I'll prove it,
even if it kills me.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.250
Why do I always have to be so literal?

19:04.333 --> 19:06.667
That's my limelight she's seeing.

19:06.750 --> 19:10.291
Baloo, look what Wildcat found.
It fell off the stunt plane.

19:10.375 --> 19:15.000
Yeah... without this thingy,
there's no way you could do your stunt.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.208
You'd crash.
Good thing you aren't up there now.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.458
Rebecca!

19:24.792 --> 19:28.250
Don't worry, Becky.
I'll get you out of this in a jiffy.

19:33.417 --> 19:36.000
Doesn't say that in the script.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.583
Who cares?
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

19:39.667 --> 19:41.125
Oh, dear.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.792
-Hang on!
-To what?

19:53.041 --> 19:57.834
-Grab my hand!
-No! I refuse to budge until we talk.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.500
Talk?
Are you kidding?

20:00.583 --> 20:01.834
Couldn't we talk later,

20:01.917 --> 20:04.917
I mean, say after we're
on the ground in one piece?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.792
No. What's the good of me
going to all this trouble

20:07.875 --> 20:10.417
if we don't have a good heart-to-heart
right here and now?

20:10.500 --> 20:14.917
All right, all right, we'll talk!
But what do you want to about?

20:15.000 --> 20:19.125
You said we were friends, Baloo,
but then you never treated me like one.

20:19.208 --> 20:22.333
I love it!
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

20:22.417 --> 20:24.208
[yawns]

20:24.500 --> 20:27.500
Friends talk, they trust each other,
and they stick together,

20:27.583 --> 20:28.750
you said so yourself!

20:28.834 --> 20:31.417
Oh, Baloo better go faster or he
and Miss Cunningham

20:31.500 --> 20:33.458
are gonna get glued to the pavement.

20:33.542 --> 20:36.917
You're right,
I haven't been much of a friend.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.125
Too many stars in my eyes, I guess.

20:40.208 --> 20:44.041
-Is it too late to try again, Rebecca?
-It's Becky.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.166
Baloo! Miss Cunningham!

20:52.625 --> 20:55.041
-They made it!
-All right, they made it!

20:55.166 --> 20:59.500
Cut, cut! Print!
Oscar, here I come.

21:01.959 --> 21:04.291
Oh, no!

21:05.208 --> 21:09.250
No, no, no!
That idiot was supposed to crash!

21:09.333 --> 21:12.583
He's completely ruined my accident!

21:13.250 --> 21:16.500
Did I say accident?
<i>Petite moi?</i>

21:16.583 --> 21:18.417
Friends for life?

21:18.500 --> 21:22.667
Friends. Even if you are easily fooled
by a pretty face.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.959
[Baloo]
And a great set of legs, too.

21:26.041 --> 21:29.834
Hey, just kidding, boss lady.
Just kidding.

21:29.917 --> 21:32.500
I'll never be star-struck again.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.458
Wow, you guys sure cut it close.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.583
I thought it was
going to be spatula time.

21:42.667 --> 21:48.375
No, Kit. Me and my friend here,
we had everything under control.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.625
Great. I got to be going.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.709
But, Kit, we were just
leaving for home and--

21:52.792 --> 21:57.417
Home? But I got an audition
for the new Bumphrey Hogart film.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.667
Bumphrey Hogart!

21:59.750 --> 22:04.166
Why, he's only the dreamiest star
in the whole world.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.458
Wait, Kit, wait!

22:05.542 --> 22:07.583
A star?

22:09.375 --> 22:12.917
[groans]
Now what's gotten into them?
