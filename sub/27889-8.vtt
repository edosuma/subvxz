WEBVTT

00:12.578 --> 00:15.214
Inside!

00:15.248 --> 00:16.783
-( whimpering )
-( Lee crying )

00:16.816 --> 00:19.185
In me! In me!
It's in...

00:19.819 --> 00:20.886
It's inside!

00:20.920 --> 00:22.689
-( Lee groans )
-What the fuck?

00:23.456 --> 00:25.291
( Logan grunting )

00:28.828 --> 00:30.630
( breathing heavily )

00:32.998 --> 00:35.035
( panting )

00:39.038 --> 00:41.074
( grunting )

00:45.411 --> 00:47.647
( panting )

00:49.048 --> 00:50.949
( grunts and sobs )

00:50.983 --> 00:52.485
( groans )

00:57.590 --> 00:59.225
( sniffles and sobs )

00:59.825 --> 01:02.162
( breathing heavily )

01:06.532 --> 01:08.568
( sobbing )

01:09.535 --> 01:10.570
Help.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.213
Somebody, help me!

01:22.715 --> 01:24.283
( shuddering )

01:24.317 --> 01:26.152
-Oh, my God.
-( thuds )

01:28.354 --> 01:29.989
( gasps ) What happened?

01:30.022 --> 01:31.057
( sobs )

01:31.090 --> 01:32.892
Oh, God! Logan!

01:32.925 --> 01:34.160
What happened to Lee?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.529
( indistinct chattering )

02:12.065 --> 02:15.134
man: Won't take long
to get your head around.

02:15.168 --> 02:18.905
Main hub's in here,
where most of our residents
spend the day.

02:18.938 --> 02:22.441
We just make sure
they log out long enough
to go to the bathroom.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.277
Otherwise, it gets messy,
you know.

02:26.546 --> 02:30.083
Meals are served at 8:00 a.m.,
1:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.

02:30.116 --> 02:32.085
-Can you cook?
-No.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.520
Well, you'll learn fast.

02:35.021 --> 02:36.455
Right. ( exhales )

02:36.488 --> 02:38.725
First task to
kick off every day.

02:39.758 --> 02:41.161
Clean the bathrooms.

02:41.961 --> 02:43.996
You're fucking
kidding me, right?

02:44.029 --> 02:48.401
Shouldn't the first task
be, like, watering plants
or something?

02:48.968 --> 02:50.637
Baptism of fire, baby.

02:54.574 --> 02:55.808
( sighs )

02:56.509 --> 02:57.644
So...

02:58.177 --> 02:59.546
What did you do?

03:00.112 --> 03:02.281
Hmm. Nothing.

03:02.315 --> 03:04.384
Drove around downtown,
putting babies on spikes.

03:05.718 --> 03:06.853
( chuckles )

03:07.787 --> 03:08.821
Okay.

03:11.757 --> 03:12.725
( sighs )

03:18.631 --> 03:20.333
( groans ) Fuck me.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.570
( exhales )

03:26.272 --> 03:28.074
Whoa! What the fuck is that?

03:28.107 --> 03:29.909
-( gasps )
-Mia:<i> What?</i>

03:29.942 --> 03:33.346
You never seen
a 79-year-old
vagina before?

03:33.379 --> 03:36.916
No, I have not.
( stammers ) I was happy
keeping it that way.

03:36.949 --> 03:39.552
Would you please cover your...

03:39.585 --> 03:43.389
Oh. I thought you kids
paid for vintage these days.

03:43.422 --> 03:45.124
What? That's disgust...

03:45.158 --> 03:47.794
Please, pick
your things back up.

03:48.827 --> 03:50.964
( groaning )

03:52.664 --> 03:53.966
Help me.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.668
-What?
-Help me.

03:55.701 --> 03:59.105
No. No fucking way.
You gotta wash
your hands first.

03:59.138 --> 04:02.775
I can only wash them
if I get to the sink.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.111
( groaning )

04:06.145 --> 04:08.681
All right, just hold my arm.

04:10.550 --> 04:14.487
I've got to say. You're not
going to last long here

04:14.520 --> 04:17.690
if something
this insignificant
freaks you out.

04:17.723 --> 04:19.859
Great. Hopefully,
they'll fire me.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.394
Oh...

04:21.427 --> 04:23.829
What? Oh, my God.
What are you...

04:23.862 --> 04:25.498
That's disgusting, okay?

04:26.265 --> 04:27.667
( laughs )
This is gonna be fun.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.036
Oh, God!
What is wrong with you?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.306
-( water running )
-( laughing )

04:43.482 --> 04:45.685
( alarm blaring )

04:50.088 --> 04:51.024
( thuds )

05:02.968 --> 05:04.003
What the hell
is going on?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.607
( alarm continues blaring )

05:33.366 --> 05:34.634
It's in there.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.072
( door beeps )

05:45.311 --> 05:46.779
Lana: Jesus! Are you okay?

05:48.381 --> 05:50.049
( whimpering )

05:50.883 --> 05:51.851
It's not my blood.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.726
( footsteps thudding )

06:04.797 --> 06:05.931
Oh, my God.

06:05.965 --> 06:06.933
( exhales )

06:06.966 --> 06:07.967
Don't.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.139
-( breathes heavily )
-( Logan sniffling )

06:16.575 --> 06:19.011
-What the hell happened?
-Logan: I don't know.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.413
( Lana gasping )

06:20.446 --> 06:21.681
Logan:<i> I just...</i>

06:22.815 --> 06:24.517
I just woke up,

06:25.484 --> 06:27.120
and she was lying on top of me.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.124
There was blood everywhere.

06:32.257 --> 06:33.893
( Logan breathing heavily )

06:35.828 --> 06:36.929
She said,

06:37.896 --> 06:38.765
"Inside..."

06:40.332 --> 06:41.534
What?

06:42.234 --> 06:43.403
She...

06:44.069 --> 06:45.972
Before she died, she said,

06:48.040 --> 06:49.675
"It's in me."

06:49.708 --> 06:52.811
That's what Taylor said
after he'd been infected.

06:52.845 --> 06:55.181
Same as the crew member
we found in Cell 50.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.817
So, it was her.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.787
Come on, guys.
That's a pretty
clear message.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.356
Lee was a fucking alien.
It's what I said
from the start.

07:04.390 --> 07:05.458
No.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.427
She can't be.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.997
That doesn't make any sense.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.167
( Logan sniffles )

07:15.400 --> 07:16.602
We have to see it.

07:17.669 --> 07:19.005
It's the only way we'll know.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.177
( Abigail sobbing )

07:32.851 --> 07:35.555
( hip-hop music
playing over speakers )

07:47.232 --> 07:49.167
( keys jingling )

07:49.201 --> 07:51.037
( distant siren wailing )

07:52.905 --> 07:55.475
( men chattering indistinctly )

08:05.451 --> 08:06.786
( distant gunshots )

08:08.186 --> 08:09.555
( loud thudding )

08:09.588 --> 08:11.824
( indistinct arguing )

08:23.302 --> 08:24.704
( sighs )

08:42.421 --> 08:44.123
-( bucket clatters )
-( Logan sighs )

08:49.428 --> 08:51.197
What are you doing here?

08:51.230 --> 08:53.165
Cleaning up your shit.

08:53.198 --> 08:56.402
Like I did yesterday,
and the day before that,

08:56.435 --> 08:58.304
and so this
trend continues.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.306
I don't know you.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.142
Mia, it's Logan.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.278
( gasping )

09:05.311 --> 09:06.779
-Mia, it's Logan.
-Don't hurt me.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.180
-I've been here
every day this week.
-Please, don't.

09:08.213 --> 09:09.148
You know who I am!

09:09.181 --> 09:10.982
-Don't hurt me. Please...
-Hey, hey. Help!

09:11.016 --> 09:12.451
-Help! Somebody help!
-( whimpering )

09:12.484 --> 09:13.418
-( screaming )
-Hey, hey, hey.

09:13.452 --> 09:15.221
-It's okay.
-Got you.

09:15.254 --> 09:16.955
( laughing )

09:16.989 --> 09:18.290
You bitch!

09:18.323 --> 09:22.094
I have
a degenerative disease,
not dementia, dipshit.

09:22.127 --> 09:23.229
That's not fucking funny.

09:24.062 --> 09:25.631
I'm laughing.

09:26.198 --> 09:27.433
Fuckin' crazy old bat.

09:27.466 --> 09:30.235
You know,
you're fun to bully.
( chuckles )

09:30.268 --> 09:34.039
You would have been
exactly my type,
a few years back.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.041
A few...
You mean a few decades.

09:36.074 --> 09:38.177
And even then, let's face it.
I'm way out of your league.

09:39.077 --> 09:41.280
Hmm. Picky.

09:42.715 --> 09:45.551
-So, Community Service.
-Would you... ( sighs )

09:45.584 --> 09:48.587
Let me guess.
You wanna know what I did.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.056
Sorry, but I don't
give a rat's ass.

09:51.089 --> 09:53.759
But what I do want to know...
Come here.

09:53.792 --> 09:55.160
-Come here.
-What?

09:55.193 --> 09:56.762
Come here.

09:56.795 --> 09:59.966
Is that your marijuana
I can smell?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.211
Lee.

10:19.885 --> 10:20.886
I'm sorry.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.099
-( device beeps and whirs )
-( flesh sizzles )

11:00.692 --> 11:02.528
( scoffs )

11:02.561 --> 11:04.063
This is wrong.

11:06.898 --> 11:10.069
We have to see it
to know for sure.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.305
( Lana sniffles )

11:14.306 --> 11:15.307
Hey.

11:16.742 --> 11:19.045
-I know.
-Okay?

11:19.745 --> 11:21.180
( sniffles )

11:24.283 --> 11:25.317
There's no way.

11:28.554 --> 11:29.889
Is there?

11:31.590 --> 11:32.892
( tapping on glass )

11:41.433 --> 11:43.269
( footsteps thudding )

11:55.514 --> 11:56.949
( Logan grunts )

12:00.152 --> 12:01.153
Henri?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.491
There is no sign
of the creature.

12:07.659 --> 12:10.196
Her hippocampus is healthy!

12:10.763 --> 12:11.764
( sighs )

12:11.797 --> 12:13.399
Henri:<i> Lee wasn't infected!</i>

12:17.803 --> 12:19.438
Logan: Would you hurry
the fuck up?

12:19.471 --> 12:23.008
I can't afford to get
community service on top
of my community service.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.110
Oh, don't be
such a pussy.

12:25.143 --> 12:28.414
( sniffles ) Seriously,
no one pays any
attention to us at all.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.557
( both sniffling )

12:39.591 --> 12:40.826
So, uh...

12:42.427 --> 12:43.729
What's with the legs?

12:43.762 --> 12:45.430
No. It'll depress you.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.231
( scoffs )

12:46.265 --> 12:48.200
My default setting
is depressed.

12:50.935 --> 12:53.439
Well, like I said,
it's a degenerative disease.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.674
It's genetic.

12:55.707 --> 12:59.911
One day, it just kicked in
and there was nothing
I could do.

12:59.944 --> 13:02.747
First the feet,
then the legs.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.651
Now my damn hands
are starting to go.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.452
Still hold a joint, though.

13:07.486 --> 13:08.921
( scoffs )

13:08.954 --> 13:10.356
( inhales deeply )

13:12.825 --> 13:14.059
But, you know...

13:15.227 --> 13:17.896
Can't do up my
damn laces anymore.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.199
It's fucking degrading,
is what it is.

13:21.166 --> 13:21.933
( sighs )

13:21.967 --> 13:24.170
-Fuck. Sorry.
-Ah, me, too.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.705
( smacks lips )

13:26.738 --> 13:28.374
But there is
a silver lining.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.276
-Yeah?
-Yep.

13:31.310 --> 13:36.481
Eightieth birthday's
coming up in 298 days.

13:36.515 --> 13:39.285
What? ( coughs )
You actually like
your fucking birthday?

13:39.318 --> 13:42.254
It's not the fucking birthday,
it's what it represents.

13:42.954 --> 13:45.457
Voluntary euthanasia.

13:46.191 --> 13:47.726
Mmm-hmm.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.029
Yeah, once you hit
the 80-year mark,

13:50.062 --> 13:54.066
state of California approves
legally-assisted suicide.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.268
( chuckles )

13:57.669 --> 13:59.971
So you're gonna
kill yourself?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.842
Well, I wouldn't exactly
put it like that.

14:04.209 --> 14:07.580
Oh, come on,
Community Service.
What do I got to live for?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.181
No husband.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.317
No kids.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.384
You think I wanna

14:13.418 --> 14:18.490
spend my days
as a vegetable marinading
in this shithole? Hmm?

14:19.391 --> 14:21.026
Yeah, but...

14:21.059 --> 14:24.196
-Your mind's not gone.
You could still--
-What?

14:26.064 --> 14:29.368
Live out my days
in VR heaven?

14:33.605 --> 14:35.107
( inhales )

14:35.574 --> 14:36.876
No, thank you.

14:37.809 --> 14:40.346
I didn't choose
to come into this world,

14:41.746 --> 14:44.083
but I can choose to go out.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.222
Final bit of control I have.

14:51.456 --> 14:56.195
To shuffle off this
shitty mortal coil.

15:04.235 --> 15:05.604
Baum: It has to
have been her.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.641
-Otherwise--
-Someone here
is still infected.

15:09.674 --> 15:10.609
Abigail: Oh, God.

15:11.543 --> 15:12.578
( retches )

15:12.611 --> 15:13.913
( coughing )

15:15.147 --> 15:17.082
So what the fuck
happened to her?

15:17.949 --> 15:20.052
There is an entry wound.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.088
The eye was punctured
with force.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.091
That was the cause of death.

15:26.124 --> 15:28.193
-What do you mean?
-Lee was murdered!

15:32.063 --> 15:35.401
But that means...
One of us... We...

15:44.943 --> 15:46.145
Shun.

15:46.578 --> 15:47.780
Hey.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.014
What are you doing, man?

15:49.047 --> 15:50.149
Shun:<i> He was with her.
He's covered in her blood.</i>

15:50.182 --> 15:52.417
You're insane.
He can barely walk, Shun.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.253
Neither could Taylor.
Didn't stop him trying
to put a bullet in my head.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.257
Henri: Shun,
put the gun down.
You're not thinking rationally.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.593
( shouts ) Not rational?
You just said
someone killed Lee.

16:02.694 --> 16:04.229
Anyone else got a suspect?

16:05.664 --> 16:07.733
-He's right.
-Wait.

16:08.566 --> 16:10.168
You can't do this.

16:10.201 --> 16:11.670
Look, I would
never hurt Lee.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.072
Okay? We were friends.

16:14.105 --> 16:16.342
-Since when?
-Since we...

16:20.178 --> 16:22.413
I can't say
anything, all right.

16:22.447 --> 16:24.249
You're gonna have to
if you wanna live.

16:29.588 --> 16:30.589
Katie:<i> Logan.</i>

16:31.623 --> 16:32.758
Sorry, Lee.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.595
We were working together.

16:38.463 --> 16:41.133
On a way
of exposing the parasite.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.069
Shun: How could
either of you possibly know
how to do that?

16:45.303 --> 16:47.005
( groans )

16:47.038 --> 16:48.374
Lee had a theory.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.276
About memory.

16:52.844 --> 16:55.514
Eric's real name
wasn't Eric. Right?

16:55.547 --> 16:58.450
He stole it from a crew member,
because he couldn't
remember his own,

16:58.483 --> 16:59.651
and Taylor...

17:02.120 --> 17:04.089
He forgot he was a medic.

17:07.626 --> 17:10.228
Lee figured it out.
This thing,
it fucks with your brain.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.064
-With the hippocampus?
-Yeah.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.766
Lee and I
discussed it briefly.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.936
We questioned
whether the damage
to the hippocampus

17:17.969 --> 17:19.772
could have affected
episodic memory.

17:21.039 --> 17:23.542
Their autobiographical
recall.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.281
But we established
there was no way
to test for that.

17:30.548 --> 17:33.185
Especially once the scanners
were destroyed.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.321
Except there was.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.460
Lee had data on all of us.

17:41.493 --> 17:42.561
What kind of data?

17:43.728 --> 17:44.730
Logan: I don't know.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.669
She brought it from Earth
on a chip.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.238
She said it was
everything she needed.

17:54.205 --> 17:55.474
Baum:<i> That's what
the video was.</i>

17:56.408 --> 17:58.143
When we found her
in the control room.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.680
-Yeah.
-Lana: Okay. ( sniffles )

18:01.713 --> 18:03.815
This chip,

18:03.849 --> 18:04.850
where is it?

18:07.052 --> 18:08.286
I don't know.

18:08.319 --> 18:10.722
Then how are we
supposed to know that's true?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.357
'Cause she's fucking dead.

18:13.958 --> 18:15.693
Don't you get it?

18:15.727 --> 18:19.331
Lee was about to expose
the alien, and they got to her
before she could.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.402
Her test
was gonna work.

18:24.435 --> 18:29.508
If this chip really exists,
it still can.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.384
( Lana sighs )

18:43.121 --> 18:44.490
We just have to find it.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.131
-Rey:<i> What the fuck?</i>
-( keypad beeping )

18:53.164 --> 18:54.265
( alarm blaring )

18:54.299 --> 18:55.267
automated voice:
<i> Quarantine activated.</i>

18:55.300 --> 18:56.401

18:56.434 --> 18:57.869
automated voice:
<i> Lockdown in progress.</i>

18:57.903 --> 18:59.271
Rey: Open the door!

19:03.107 --> 19:05.310
-It must have been him.
-He's infected.

19:06.211 --> 19:07.779
( panting )

19:18.423 --> 19:20.425
No, this can't be happening.

19:20.458 --> 19:23.162
It can't be him. It can't be.
We've spent days together.

19:26.064 --> 19:26.932
Lana: Come on.

19:27.866 --> 19:29.201
-Shun: Damn it.
-Lana: Fuck!

19:29.234 --> 19:30.469
( grunting )

19:30.502 --> 19:31.370
Move.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.540
( whimpers )

19:37.175 --> 19:38.443
( Logan coughing )

19:55.961 --> 19:56.962
( softly ) Come on.

19:57.896 --> 19:59.198
( shatters )

20:08.840 --> 20:10.041
Back!

20:10.075 --> 20:11.210
Both of us.

20:11.676 --> 20:13.212
Two, one...

20:16.615 --> 20:19.417
-( shattering )
-Shit. Fuck.

20:19.450 --> 20:21.420
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

20:23.188 --> 20:24.489
( Lana exhales )

20:26.324 --> 20:27.960
( glass crunching )

20:31.296 --> 20:32.998
Right. Let's go.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.770
( Logan coughing )

20:39.805 --> 20:40.805
-Logan. You can't.
-No.

20:40.838 --> 20:44.142
-I have to know
if he's infected.
-I know.

20:44.175 --> 20:45.777
But you have to
let them do this.

20:47.745 --> 20:50.482
( groaning )

20:50.515 --> 20:52.117
-( music playing )
-( automated voice reading )

20:52.150 --> 20:54.318
automated voice:<i> The ICO
Corporation's revolutionary</i>

21:01.259 --> 21:02.894
( Mia chomping loudly )

21:04.930 --> 21:06.398
( straining )

21:09.867 --> 21:12.871
Hey, Community Service,
you missed a spot.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.009
( Logan sighs )

21:20.312 --> 21:21.913
I know you did that
on purpose.

21:22.947 --> 21:23.949
Would you just stop?

21:25.384 --> 21:26.718
( Logan grunts )

21:29.387 --> 21:30.889
You ever think about this?

21:30.922 --> 21:33.525
Grey: ( on TV )
<i> Imagine a life
free from suffering.</i>

21:33.558 --> 21:36.328
Logan: What, the creepy
space colony?

21:37.261 --> 21:39.297
It's like Scientology
in another solar system.

21:39.330 --> 21:42.434
-No, thank you.
-Oh, come on.

21:42.467 --> 21:46.038
What about all that
clean slate stuff, huh?

21:47.005 --> 21:48.674
Hey.

21:48.707 --> 21:54.079
You could be the poster boy
for a down-and-out nobody

21:54.112 --> 21:56.381
turning his life around.

21:57.716 --> 21:58.717
Well, thanks.

22:00.184 --> 22:02.353
( scoffs )
You know what, Mia?

22:02.387 --> 22:05.557
This life is shitty enough
as it is. I don't need
to start a new one.

22:06.023 --> 22:07.459
Ow!

22:07.492 --> 22:08.993
( whispers ) Ow.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.896
-What the hell was that for?
-Oh, you deserve it.

22:11.930 --> 22:15.500
I see you, Community Service,
month after month,

22:15.534 --> 22:18.704
with that black cloud
over your head,

22:18.737 --> 22:23.474
harping on about the raw deal
you got. ( grunts )

22:23.508 --> 22:25.376
Do you know what, Mia?

22:25.410 --> 22:27.378
You don't know
half the shit
I've been through.

22:27.412 --> 22:29.047
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.515
Yeah, well...

22:30.548 --> 22:32.951
( laughs )
Are you dying?

22:35.687 --> 22:36.688
Whatever.

22:39.357 --> 22:40.692
You know what I'd give

22:41.927 --> 22:43.462
to roll back the decades,

22:44.463 --> 22:46.398
sign up for something
like that?

22:48.666 --> 22:50.802
To be able to
climb a mountain,

22:52.904 --> 22:54.072
fall in love...

22:58.443 --> 23:00.612
Sit by the goddamn sea.

23:03.749 --> 23:08.653
I suppose you think
I'd rather be here in this dump

23:08.686 --> 23:12.023
-eating this
shitty pineapple...
-( spoon clatters )

23:14.392 --> 23:16.294
( sobbing )

23:16.328 --> 23:17.929
Jesus fucking Christ.

23:22.601 --> 23:23.935
Logan:<i> Just hang on.</i>

23:25.837 --> 23:26.905
( sighs )

23:26.938 --> 23:27.806
God...

23:28.940 --> 23:29.941
( splashes )

23:36.314 --> 23:37.549
-Here, just...
-( whimpers )

23:41.086 --> 23:42.120
There, okay?

23:45.824 --> 23:48.727
I can't...

23:51.228 --> 23:52.431
It's okay.

23:53.831 --> 23:54.833
Here.

23:55.266 --> 23:56.601
No. No way.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.004
Don't be a stubborn asshole.

24:08.579 --> 24:10.448
-There.
-( sobs )

24:10.482 --> 24:12.083
See, it's not so bad, huh?

24:20.691 --> 24:22.727
Lee had a good
sense of humor.

24:25.396 --> 24:26.965
I was just getting
to know her.

24:31.436 --> 24:32.771
She saved your life.

24:34.839 --> 24:35.874
What?

24:36.907 --> 24:39.244
After you were hurt,
you needed a transfusion.

24:40.578 --> 24:42.080
We didn't know
your blood type.

24:43.915 --> 24:48.086
Lee wouldn't say how,
but she knew it.

24:50.488 --> 24:51.957
I never told her that.

24:53.224 --> 24:54.659
But she had
this data, right?

24:56.027 --> 24:57.262
That's how she knew.

24:58.662 --> 25:00.165
It all makes sense now.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.735
She fixed it.

25:04.402 --> 25:06.304
What?

25:06.337 --> 25:08.673
Fuck me.
She fucking fixed it.

25:09.073 --> 25:10.876
( grunting )

25:16.648 --> 25:18.750
( Lana breathing heavily )

25:23.387 --> 25:24.890
Where could
he have gone?

25:26.524 --> 25:29.093
Captain's cabin.
That's where
Lee was last.

25:29.127 --> 25:29.995
Wait.

25:31.429 --> 25:34.032
We're both on
the same page, right?

25:38.536 --> 25:39.804
Shoot to kill.

25:50.948 --> 25:52.284
( panting )

25:55.086 --> 25:56.421
( yells )

25:56.454 --> 25:58.924
( objects clattering )

26:05.830 --> 26:08.566
( stammering ) I can't.

26:08.599 --> 26:09.734
( exhales )

26:09.767 --> 26:10.969
I can't watch you.

26:25.483 --> 26:26.952
( door beeps )

27:04.956 --> 27:05.890
Henri:<i> Lana.</i>

27:12.363 --> 27:13.865
Baum, don't.

27:14.665 --> 27:15.967
( Baum shushing )

27:16.000 --> 27:19.504
Lee had this chip, right?
But she couldn't read it.

27:19.537 --> 27:21.873
The only scanner
onboard was broken.

27:21.906 --> 27:24.876
That's what we
were doing together.
We were fixing it.

27:24.909 --> 27:29.414
So she must have
finished the job, if she
had access to the data.

27:29.447 --> 27:30.315
Exactly.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.918
She's the reason
why it happened now.

27:35.486 --> 27:37.122
She finally had the key.

27:38.389 --> 27:40.125
( Henri whimpers )

27:41.993 --> 27:42.894
Let him go.

27:43.594 --> 27:45.429
( scoffs )
Yeah, right.

27:45.463 --> 27:46.864
Don't you dare
fucking hurt him.

27:46.898 --> 27:48.900
-I'm not infected.
-Bullshit.

27:48.933 --> 27:51.035
I wanted to find the chip
before the alien could.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.736
How are we supposed
to believe that?

27:52.770 --> 27:55.306
-It's not me!
-Lana:<i> Okay.</i>

27:59.176 --> 28:02.047
If you're telling
the truth, let him go.

28:03.915 --> 28:07.052
Let him go, and we'll know
you're not dangerous.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.722
( Baum grunts )

28:10.755 --> 28:13.191
-He'll shoot.
-He won't.

28:14.491 --> 28:15.727
Tell him.

28:20.297 --> 28:21.399
Baum:<i> Guns on the floor.</i>

28:25.904 --> 28:26.771
Okay.

28:32.443 --> 28:34.311
( whimpers )

28:34.345 --> 28:35.814
You gotta believe me, okay?

28:42.253 --> 28:43.254
( grunts )

28:43.654 --> 28:44.723
No, wait!

28:47.324 --> 28:48.359
( door beeps )

28:49.828 --> 28:51.296
( both panting )

28:51.629 --> 28:52.864
Shit.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.140
You figured out
who's infected, didn't you?

29:03.574 --> 29:04.642
( sniffles )

29:04.676 --> 29:05.977
And they found you.

29:07.345 --> 29:08.513
Who's infected?

29:10.514 --> 29:12.150
You mean Baum?

29:12.183 --> 29:13.918
( exhales )

29:13.951 --> 29:15.686
Just doesn't feel right.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.655
( sniffles ) It's not him.

29:17.688 --> 29:20.892
-Why else would he
lock us in here, Logan?
-I don't fucking know.

29:22.694 --> 29:23.795
It's not him.

29:27.998 --> 29:29.901
I wish you
could wake up, Lee.

29:32.003 --> 29:33.204
I wish you could help me.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.109
( sobs softly )

29:48.019 --> 29:49.254
( softly ) "Inside..."

29:51.122 --> 29:52.322
What?

29:52.356 --> 29:54.492
( gasps )

29:54.526 --> 29:56.227
Holy shit,
that's what she meant.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.362
( sniffles )

29:58.062 --> 30:00.164
The chip's inside her, Kate.

30:00.197 --> 30:02.534
The answer to all this
is inside her fucking wrist.

30:08.405 --> 30:09.841
Logan: Ta-da!

30:12.743 --> 30:14.212
( sighs )

30:18.349 --> 30:19.950
So... ( chuckles )

30:19.984 --> 30:22.120
Nine months flew by, huh?

30:24.289 --> 30:27.091
My last piece
of birthday cake.

30:31.395 --> 30:32.429
( retches )

30:32.463 --> 30:36.367
-What?
-Holy fuck.
Dead kittens taste better.

30:41.972 --> 30:44.509
What's up,
Community Service?

30:44.542 --> 30:47.879
You're not getting
sentimental on me, are you?

30:48.479 --> 30:49.347
No.

30:52.116 --> 30:52.984
Maybe.

30:57.455 --> 31:01.092
Come on, you're not gonna
miss helping me take
a leak. ( chuckles )

31:01.125 --> 31:02.327
( sighs )

31:07.164 --> 31:08.032
Fuck it.

31:08.466 --> 31:10.068
( plate clinks )

31:15.339 --> 31:16.207
Get in.

31:16.974 --> 31:18.743
-What?
-You heard me.

31:18.776 --> 31:22.113
If this really is your last
birthday, then I'm gonna
make it one to remember.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.883
Now get your ass
in this chair.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.499
( inhales deeply )

31:44.435 --> 31:45.503
Are you speeding?

31:46.437 --> 31:47.305
No.

31:48.639 --> 31:49.641
Why not?

31:50.408 --> 31:51.709
( chuckles )

31:51.742 --> 31:54.112
-( engine revs )
-Whoo!

31:58.783 --> 32:00.618
So, where the hell
are we going, huh?

32:01.786 --> 32:03.320
It's a surprise.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.622
Ooh!

32:08.025 --> 32:10.595
You got any music
in this shithole limo, huh?

32:13.864 --> 32:15.633
( rock music playing on radio )

-Papa Roach.

to get it out?

What are we gonna
do with him?

34:12.416 --> 34:14.218
He can't hide
in there for long.

34:16.086 --> 34:17.488
He could
have killed me.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.491
He didn't.

34:20.524 --> 34:22.427
It's not like
he had much choice.

have to help me.

-What?
-Yeah.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.795
There. Just reach in
and grab it.

35:31.795 --> 35:33.297
Thank you.

35:35.099 --> 35:36.601
( birds calling )

35:38.202 --> 35:39.570
You said you wanted
the sea.

35:40.938 --> 35:42.340
You were right.

35:44.608 --> 35:46.444
This is a birthday
to remember.

35:47.077 --> 35:48.646
( sniffles )

35:54.385 --> 35:56.354
You got a girl,
Community Service?

36:00.424 --> 36:01.292
No.

36:05.496 --> 36:09.300
Piece of advice
from a withered hag.

36:11.201 --> 36:13.204
Find one.

36:13.237 --> 36:17.575
Or a guy, if that's the side
your bread is buttered on.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.446
But find someone.

36:26.516 --> 36:30.688
The world ain't half
as fun without someone
to share it with.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.393
I got you, ain't I?

36:36.760 --> 36:38.261
( chuckles )

36:38.295 --> 36:39.230
I know what you're doing.

36:39.263 --> 36:40.998
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.834
-What am I doing?
-It's my plan.

36:45.836 --> 36:49.840
-I can't just deviate from it.
-Yes, you can.

36:51.108 --> 36:52.410
Yes, you can.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.013
I know you think
you gotta do this

36:56.046 --> 36:58.816
because you've got nothing
and you've got no one, but...

37:01.118 --> 37:05.689
Mia, I felt the same
fucking way when I came
to that home, all right?

37:05.723 --> 37:11.762
I thought I was gonna
shoot myself cleaning out
some old guy's ears,

37:11.796 --> 37:14.999
and wiping his ass
and feeding him
processed pears.

37:19.336 --> 37:21.905
Now I actually look forward
to my goddamn shift,

37:21.939 --> 37:22.706
( chuckling )

37:22.740 --> 37:24.408
because I know
you're gonna be there.

37:31.548 --> 37:34.352
Just give it a week. Huh?

37:34.852 --> 37:36.654
( scoffs )

37:36.687 --> 37:40.223
Maybe a month.
Fuck it, who knows,
maybe a year.

37:40.257 --> 37:41.425
( sighs )

37:45.629 --> 37:48.632
I know you wanna die
on your own terms, Mia,

37:48.665 --> 37:51.969
but you don't have to
die yet.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.509
( sobbing )

37:59.743 --> 38:03.281
That's the fucked-up thing
about this world.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.851
People constantly

38:07.985 --> 38:08.919
surprise you.

38:12.189 --> 38:16.694
I was so sure
you were gonna
be an asshole.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.530
( laughing )

38:22.332 --> 38:23.668
Happy birthday, Mia.

38:48.392 --> 38:51.796
Thank you
for coming with me.

38:53.864 --> 38:54.999
-( sighs )
-I just...

38:58.368 --> 39:00.438
I couldn't se
another person die.

39:01.405 --> 39:02.573
Me neither.

39:06.276 --> 39:08.412
You know, I never
got to know Lee.

39:09.914 --> 39:11.415
I didn't really try.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.722
None of this feels real.

39:19.256 --> 39:21.125
Ever since the asteroid,

39:22.292 --> 39:23.761
ever since Taylor,

39:27.631 --> 39:29.367
I feel like we're in hell.

39:38.141 --> 39:39.443
I don't believe in hell.

39:45.349 --> 39:47.418
( screaming )

39:48.118 --> 39:50.654
( sobs and groans )

39:59.296 --> 40:01.832

40:28.425 --> 40:29.793

40:29.827 --> 40:30.961
( door opens )

40:53.083 --> 40:54.685
Henri: Oh, my God.

41:05.429 --> 41:06.931
This is what killed her.

41:08.665 --> 41:10.568
This is what killed Lee.

41:16.606 --> 41:18.008
Whose cabin is this?

41:22.112 --> 41:23.881
( Logan coughs )

41:27.117 --> 41:28.118
( Logan groans )

41:28.151 --> 41:29.452
Katie: No.

41:29.486 --> 41:30.487
( Logan coughs )

41:30.521 --> 41:32.256
-You have to stop.
-I can't.

41:32.289 --> 41:33.657
Logan, you're gonna
kill yourself.

41:33.690 --> 41:36.694
Lee died because of what
we were trying to do.

41:37.227 --> 41:38.162
Okay?

41:38.829 --> 41:40.664
I have to do this for her.

41:42.132 --> 41:43.868
You need to
trust someone.

41:45.769 --> 41:46.871
Trust me.

41:53.443 --> 41:56.479
-Oh, hey, dude.
-Did you make that?

41:56.513 --> 41:57.915
You said I'd learn, right?
( chuckles)

41:59.950 --> 42:00.985
Logan, wait.

42:03.153 --> 42:05.756
-Where is she?
-She checked out this morning.

42:05.789 --> 42:07.658
I figured you'd know.

42:08.291 --> 42:09.926
It was always her plan.

42:09.959 --> 42:12.630
( stutters ) No, she was
changing her mind.

42:15.598 --> 42:17.901
-What time did she leave?
-Crack of dawn.

42:17.934 --> 42:20.738
-She was driven straight
to the clinic.
-No.

42:21.338 --> 42:23.306
No.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.276
There's no way she would have
left without saying goodbye.

42:26.309 --> 42:29.279
Mia wasn't really one
for the difficult
conversation.

42:29.313 --> 42:30.781
I wouldn't take it
to heart.

42:31.915 --> 42:34.284
We got someone new
moving in today.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.887
Maybe you'll click
with him, too.

42:41.391 --> 42:42.793
( sniffles )

42:43.426 --> 42:44.828
( exhales )

43:14.491 --> 43:15.659
Hey!

43:16.593 --> 43:18.295
Are you Community Service?

43:19.563 --> 43:20.631
What?

43:21.698 --> 43:23.300
Mia left something for you.

43:25.001 --> 43:27.538
-What is it?
-Oh, I don't know.

43:27.571 --> 43:29.806
She said to look in the place

43:29.839 --> 43:32.409
where you do that thing
you're a pussy about,

43:32.443 --> 43:37.081
because you don't want
community service on top
of your community service.

43:38.082 --> 43:40.784
( scoffs )
She said you'd get it.

43:42.919 --> 43:43.821
Yeah.

43:49.459 --> 43:51.261
( slow music playing )

44:25.562 --> 44:27.331
( laughing )

44:35.272 --> 44:37.241
( inhales sharply )

44:45.516 --> 44:46.950
Go to Ring 1.

44:47.650 --> 44:49.186
Find Cell 4.

44:50.787 --> 44:53.489
There's a crate
marked "501."

44:53.523 --> 44:55.192
We hid the scanner inside.

44:57.227 --> 44:59.129
Make sure it works.

44:59.163 --> 45:01.065
Then bring it
back to me, okay?

45:05.468 --> 45:06.970
Be careful, Kate.

I can't tell you.

We found the scalpel
that killed Lee.
