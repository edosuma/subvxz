WEBVTT

00:04.205 --> 00:06.440
Hey, my life
is so much richer

00:06.540 --> 00:09.543
since I started delivering meals
for Project Angel Food.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.612
I'm a good person.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.483
I don't say that enough.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.684
Uck.

00:16.784 --> 00:19.520
Bringing food to old,
homebound people.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.322
How depressing.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.257
Yeah...it's tough to see
their faces light up

00:23.357 --> 00:25.793
when they realize
they're gonna eat that day.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.130
I love being homebound.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.737
Or going to his place
and being bound.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.609
Either way,
you do get hungry.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.080
You know, Will,

00:46.180 --> 00:49.683
I used to deliver paper bags
to elderly people's doors.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.485
Of course, they were
filled with poo,

00:51.585 --> 00:53.454
and I'd set 'em on fire.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.358
So you'll be home by 7:00,
though, right?

00:57.458 --> 00:58.759
For what?
What what?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.361
Rob, Ellen, Joe, and Larry
are coming over

01:00.461 --> 01:04.498
for the tenth anniversary
game night spectacular.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.367
Wow, ten years
of game night.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.302
What a milestone.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.540
Maybe you should celebrate
with a suicide pact.

01:15.209 --> 01:18.779
Thank God I have plans
with Malcolm tonight.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.114
Malcolm?

01:20.214 --> 01:21.349
[scoffs]

01:21.449 --> 01:24.552
I can't wait till Malcolm
is your Malcolm ex.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.390
Jackie, why don't
you like him?

01:29.490 --> 01:30.824
The man is a doll.

01:32.059 --> 01:35.863
If dolls spoke seven languages
and had enormous genitalia.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.601
I would like that doll.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.241
I'll take it
when you're done with it.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.178
(Jack)
I'm sorry, Karen.

01:50.278 --> 01:51.745
I do not like this man.

01:51.845 --> 01:55.383
I do not like him
in your house.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.485
I do not like him
in your blouse.

01:58.686 --> 02:02.256
I'm sorry, I'm really engrossed
in this novel right now.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.160
Jackie, just come
a-shoppin' with us.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.462
Come on, I know
that you'll like Malcolm

02:08.562 --> 02:09.863
if you just spend some
more time with him.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.532
And besides...

02:11.632 --> 02:14.468
Honey, your opinion
means so much to me.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.337
Really?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.372
'Cause sometimes I worry
you only think of me

02:18.472 --> 02:21.909
as a trained monkey who
hops around for your amusement.

02:22.009 --> 02:25.145
That's nonsense.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.347
Now come on.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.548
All right.

02:28.549 --> 02:32.820
Oh, and if you like him,
clang your symbols once.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.455
Okay, that's everybody.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.856
Kosher meal for Lou.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.759
And low-sodium for Frida.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.893
Wait a minute,
am I missing one?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.262
One, two, three, four...

02:41.362 --> 02:42.363
Grace!

02:46.734 --> 02:48.902
You're eating Clyde's meal!

02:50.804 --> 02:52.640
Well, I hope he has
a salt shaker,

02:52.740 --> 02:54.575
'cause this crap is bland.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.749
Actually...
this works out great.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.917
It gives me an excuse
to go to Dean & DeLuca

03:04.017 --> 03:06.720
and get Clyde the lobster salad
he loves so much.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.590
God, all you talk about
is Clyde lately.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.325
What, do you love him?

03:12.526 --> 03:13.961
I sorta do.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.364
He's--he's witty
and smart.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.799
He's the kind of gay man
I'd like to be when I'm older.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.469
You know, except
without the farting.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.290
Oh, Jack, I'm so happy

03:42.390 --> 03:43.857
we're getting to know
each other better.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.294
I was so afraid when I helped
Stanley fake his own death

03:46.394 --> 03:48.262
then brought him back here
for a long-awaited reunion

03:48.362 --> 03:49.663
with his ex-wife,

03:50.864 --> 03:52.633
then fell in love with her
and started dating her myself,

03:52.666 --> 03:54.234
her friends would
have trouble accepting me.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.369
Well, it's nothing

03:55.469 --> 03:56.604
we haven't all
been through before.

03:56.704 --> 03:59.239
[chuckles]

03:59.340 --> 04:01.809
You know, Jack, I know two ways
to get a guy to call me friend.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.713
One is to attach his nipples
to a car battery.

04:05.813 --> 04:09.917
And the other is to buy him
a fine Italian suit.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.386
Do I have to choose?

04:14.388 --> 04:17.257
Jackie, this is exactly
the side of Malcolm

04:17.358 --> 04:18.726
that I wanted you to see.

04:18.826 --> 04:22.430
The playful,
torturey side.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.332
Hang on, that guy's
looking at a shirt

04:24.432 --> 04:25.466
that would
look great on you,

04:25.566 --> 04:26.567
and I can't
let that happen.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.001
Hey! Hey...

04:29.437 --> 04:31.572
Oh, isn't he cute?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.807
And he's
a real man's man.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.277
Oh, I love to watch
his strong, rough fingers

04:37.378 --> 04:39.046
unbuttoning my nighty.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.382
Oh, you know it's a wonder
he can even get it on

04:41.482 --> 04:44.284
over his head.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.554
Yes, he's nice, and...

04:46.654 --> 04:49.289
yes, he's good-looking,
and...

04:49.390 --> 04:53.060
yes, he smells like
baby powder and Greek salad.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.363
But there's
one little thing.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.430
What's that, honey?

04:56.530 --> 04:57.297
He's not Stan!

04:57.398 --> 04:58.999
You belong with Stan!

04:59.099 --> 05:00.601
Gosh, I hope
you like this.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.003
'Cause it just cost that guy
a little piece of his tongue.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.510
Hey, guys!
Hi!

05:09.610 --> 05:10.578
Did you come together?

05:10.678 --> 05:12.380
No, we met
on the elevator.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.015
Did you know our kids are in
the same kindergarten class?

05:15.115 --> 05:16.450
Isn't that funny?

05:16.550 --> 05:18.386
Is it?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.722
Anyway, welcome...

05:21.822 --> 05:25.926
to the 10th anniversary
game night spectacular!

05:26.026 --> 05:27.795
Whoo!

05:27.895 --> 05:29.397
Where are Rob and Joe?

05:29.497 --> 05:31.432
Uh, Joe couldn't come.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.800
Our babysitter canceled.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.802
Our babysitter
canceled too!

05:34.902 --> 05:36.470
Isn't that funny?

05:36.570 --> 05:37.605
That is so funny!

05:38.539 --> 05:41.074
I don't think you're
using that word right.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.013
Okay, so no Rob
and no Joe.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.848
That's okay, 'cause
they're weak players,

05:47.948 --> 05:50.584
and they never add anything
to the evening anyway.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.853
They're our husbands.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.389
Yeah, but they're duds.
That's true.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.994
Okay, so tonight will be
an all-star game.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.397
You guys
against me and will.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.466
At least we still have
an even number.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.701
Isn't that funny?

06:11.572 --> 06:12.606
Hey, everybody.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.642
Slight change
in the guest list.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.746
All the way from 1933,
my friend Clyde!

06:18.846 --> 06:20.080
Hello!

06:20.180 --> 06:21.649
Oh, it is kind of damp here.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.384
I was afraid of that.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.486
Hi.
Hello there.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.554
Nice to meet you.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.388
You must be Grace.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.124
No.
My, you're
beautiful.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.560
No, no, I'm Grace.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.861
Ah.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.031
Hello!

06:40.868 --> 06:42.603
Uh, Will, can I talk
to you for a sec?

06:42.703 --> 06:43.704
Sure!

06:44.605 --> 06:45.739
Oh, uh, Clyde,
can I get you anything?

06:46.974 --> 06:48.542
Oh, just some Tiger Balm and
a clear path to the restroom.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.446
[chuckles]

06:52.546 --> 06:54.482
What is he doing here?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.983
He's an odd number.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.453
Who needs a little company.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.721
And compassion.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.490
This is what
I do now, Grace.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.824
I give, I help,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.125
I make a difference.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.760
It's kind of who I am now.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.997
I'm--I'm Charity Will.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.866
Okay, yeah, I get
what you're doing,

07:12.966 --> 07:16.804
and, um,
and the new name is cute.

07:16.904 --> 07:17.905
But do you think you can

07:18.005 --> 07:19.206
stick your new friend
in the closet

07:19.306 --> 07:22.576
and tell him he's
in Heaven's coat room?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.778
Grace, don't worry.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.179
He's not even gonna play.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.449
Hey, Clyde, are you excited
about being the scorekeeper

07:29.550 --> 07:31.885
for the tenth anniversary
game night spectacular?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.822
Scorekeeper? I'll need
a whistle and a gun.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.625
How about a pencil and the back
of this take-out menu?

07:37.725 --> 07:39.560
Well, I'll make due.
Now, what are the rules?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.694
Oh, you know what?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.530
You don't even
need to know the rules,

07:42.630 --> 07:43.864
since you're not playing.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.500
Yeah, but it might be
more fun for him if he did know.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.968
Here's how you
play Celebrity.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.202
You take a slip
out of the bowl,

07:49.302 --> 07:50.871
and then you try
to describe it.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.172
Oh, I get it.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.874
Um, so I'd say
something like,

07:53.974 --> 07:56.544
"It's yellow, it's rectangular,
and it's folded."

07:56.644 --> 07:57.678
Gah.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.917
Karen, you and Stan
were married.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.153
You can't say that doesn't
mean anything.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.487
Oh, Jackie.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.922
You just think
that marriage is sacred

08:09.022 --> 08:11.659
because it's
legally denied you.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.161
But, honey,

08:14.261 --> 08:15.663
Stanley betrayed me.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.632
First by cheating, and then
by faking his own death.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.601
No, no, no,
I am done with him!

08:20.701 --> 08:22.269
Well, he's not
done with you!

08:22.369 --> 08:24.972
He's sorry, he loves you,
and he wants you back.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.774
How do you know?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.742
Because he told me
yesterday.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.612
You saw Stanley?

08:31.712 --> 08:35.148
No, he called me because
you won't take any of his calls.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.617
You're damn right I won't!

08:37.685 --> 08:39.720
I never wanna hear that
high-pitched voice again!

08:41.689 --> 08:43.891
I'm meeting him later
at his health club.

08:43.991 --> 08:48.128
I think it's called New York
Health and Fatness or something.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.863
So, Karen, come with me.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.098
No.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.567
I won't.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.002
I'm seeing Malcolm now.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.237
I want you to accept that
and bless our union.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.706
I can't do that.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.840
Bless it!
No!

08:59.940 --> 09:00.908
Achoo!
Bless you.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.610
Ha ha!
Ohh!

09:02.710 --> 09:03.911
Unh! Unh!

09:09.349 --> 09:11.118
Can I get you something
to drink before we start?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.120
Oh, sure, sure.
But what?

09:13.220 --> 09:17.024
Let me think.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.030
Water?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.264
No.
Tea?

09:24.364 --> 09:26.299
No.
Coffee?
Soda?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.268
Juice, beer?

09:28.368 --> 09:29.136
Tang?

09:29.236 --> 09:32.105
Yes!

09:32.205 --> 09:34.141
Tang would be nice.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.977
God, I'm sorry.
I ran out of Tang.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.779
When I was seven.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.013
Um...

09:40.113 --> 09:41.682
Never mind.
Let's get on with the game.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.817
Okay, okay, great.
These are the teams.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.653
Me and Will,
Ellen and Larry.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.120
Ready?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.656
Ohh...

09:50.023 --> 09:51.324
What's the matter?

09:51.424 --> 09:54.161
Well, your little guessing game
sounds like so much fun.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.264
I sure wish
I was playin'.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.332
And you shall.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.135
He shan't.
He can't.

10:03.871 --> 10:07.274
Because he, you know,
he doesn't have a partner.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.309
Grace...

10:09.409 --> 10:12.245
Why don't you be
partners with Clyde?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.347
I got Will!

10:14.447 --> 10:16.083
Wait, no!

10:16.183 --> 10:19.920
Uh-oh, sounds like I'm not
a very popular partner.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.155
No, no, no, no.
That's not it, it's just--

10:22.255 --> 10:25.092
It's just that I would
just feel...horrible

10:25.192 --> 10:29.096
if my dear friend Ellen
had to sit out, so...

10:29.196 --> 10:30.931
Oh, I don't mind.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.033
I think
I'm gonna enjoy this.

10:36.436 --> 10:40.173
Okay! Well, uh,
Grace, Clyde, you're up.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.274
[whispering]
Thanks a lot.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.878
Now it's a tenth anniversary
suck-tacular!

10:47.080 --> 10:49.382
[whispering]
Give him a chance.
He might be great at this.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.152
And go.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.220
Oh, good.
Oh, good, good, good.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.688
Okay, this
is an easy one.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.790
Um, uh, trashy pop singer.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.892
She pees in gas stations.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.027
Oh, this is an easy one.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.729
Lola Falana.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.134
Uh, Oops, I Did It Again.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.903
Oh, that's all right, Grace,
just open a window.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.308
Uh, okay.
Famous for nothing.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.376
(Will)
Carmen Electra.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.079
Yes.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.981
Okay, if I ever
see her face again,

11:21.081 --> 11:22.115
I'll shoot myself!

11:22.215 --> 11:23.150
Paris Hilton.
The other one.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.151
Lindsay Lohan.
The other one!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.185
Tom Cruise.
Yes!

11:25.285 --> 11:28.288
Time! Time.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.957
How many did they get?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.024
Eight.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.425
Is that more than we got?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.128
It's eight more.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.300
[steam hisses]

11:40.400 --> 11:41.769
Oh, hello, Stan.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.838
[chuckles]
It's good to see you again.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.740
You're lookin' fantastic.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.308
I, uh--whoops!
That's still you.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.344
Okay, sorry.
Did not see you there.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.146
And--op!
And there's more.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.282
Okay.
All right.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.419
Wow, it has been
two years

11:59.519 --> 12:01.955
and so much has happened
in your life.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.992
My mind is just
reeling with questions.

12:05.092 --> 12:08.829
Like, um, have you seen
my new talk show?

12:08.929 --> 12:11.965
And...can you tell
my tan is fake on the air?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.033
[steam hisses]

12:13.133 --> 12:14.902
Oh, weeknights,
4:00 a.m.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.404
Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.405
Well, give it a little
look-see

12:19.206 --> 12:21.174
and let me know
if I'm too orange.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.309
Anyway, Karen and I got in
a really big fight.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.145
I tried to convince her to get
back together with you again,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.881
and now she doesn't want
to see either of us.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.083
[harmonica plays]

12:30.183 --> 12:31.451
You brought your harmonica.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.787
Oh, no thank you.
I don't feel like--

12:33.887 --> 12:36.323
* Don't know why

12:36.423 --> 12:39.426
* There's no sun
up in the sky *

12:39.526 --> 12:40.894
Jack, you and I
need to--

12:41.962 --> 12:43.096
Oh, I'm sorry, you're
in the middle of a number.

12:43.130 --> 12:43.797
I can come back.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.066
What are you doing here?

12:46.166 --> 12:49.436
And you look ridiculous
with your towel tied like that.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.138
Jack, I didn't come in here
to threaten you

12:51.238 --> 12:52.906
into blessing
my relationship with Karen.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.975
Even though I could
revoke your passport,

12:55.075 --> 12:56.109
put your name
on a watch list,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.078
and have your cable cut off
right before the Tonys

12:58.178 --> 13:00.213
for the rest of your life.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.381
But I came here
to see Stanley.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.950
Hello, Stanley.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.018
I'm sure you've heard
all about Karen and I.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.219
[steam hisses]

13:06.319 --> 13:07.787
Karen and me.
I stand corrected.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.222
I always get that wrong.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.524
You know, um, I always
mix up "was" and "were."

13:11.624 --> 13:13.460
Yeah, I have to sing
If I Were a Rich Man

13:13.560 --> 13:15.162
to get it right.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.363
Or is it "was"?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.131
Er, that is
so hard for I.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.400
[laughs]

13:20.500 --> 13:22.535
Stanley, I know
that this is all--

13:22.635 --> 13:24.304
Uh, whoops.
He's just--

13:24.404 --> 13:26.907
I understand.
No, a little more.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.341
You know what, Ellen?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.377
I feel badly that you haven't
even had a turn yet.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.579
So why don't you
play with Clyde?

13:32.679 --> 13:33.981
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.415
I'm having fun!

13:35.515 --> 13:36.984
In fact...

13:37.084 --> 13:38.886
I'm gonna put Rob
on the phone,

13:38.986 --> 13:41.955
so he can listen.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.190
You gotta hear this.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.557
Tell him I'll e-mail him

13:44.657 --> 13:46.593
some of these great
pictures I'm getting.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.428
(Will)
Okay.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.963
Grace and Clyde
are up again.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.265
And, Grace, try
to focus, okay?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.533
Quit slowing my boy down.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.202
Flip the timer, or I'll
shove it up your a--

13:55.302 --> 13:57.504
Go.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.605
Oh, I know this one.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.041
He was in the film Titanic.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.242
Leonardo DiCaprio!

14:02.342 --> 14:03.310
Oh, no, no, no.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.444
The lead.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.512
Yes, Leonardo DiCaprio.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.880
No, think.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.149
The poor blonde boy
who froze in the water.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.583
Leonardo DiCaprio.
I'm positive.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.952
It's Leonardo DiCaprio.

14:12.052 --> 14:12.986
Time.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.888
Tom Hanks!

14:19.059 --> 14:20.460
Tom Hanks?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.263
Ooh, I bet you're the one
who feels stupid now.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.534
Anyway--
No, not anyway!

14:27.634 --> 14:28.601
Tom Hanks?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.004
Tom Hanks?!

14:31.104 --> 14:32.539
He could--he could
have said Big,

14:32.639 --> 14:36.443
or Splash,
or Forrest frickin' Gump!

14:36.543 --> 14:37.911
You know what?

14:38.979 --> 14:39.980
I have really tried
to be a good sport tonight.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.481
I sat quietly by

14:41.581 --> 14:43.550
even though
you had no idea

14:43.650 --> 14:45.352
who Eminem was,

14:45.452 --> 14:48.621
and you didn't even
know the candy!

14:50.223 --> 14:52.025
But I am done!

14:52.125 --> 14:54.261
I am done
with game night!

14:54.361 --> 14:56.229
Maybe forever!

14:56.329 --> 14:59.399
Thanks a lot, Clyde!

15:00.600 --> 15:02.602
Hey, Grace...

15:02.702 --> 15:04.071
say cheese!

15:08.141 --> 15:09.209
Mother--

15:09.309 --> 15:10.610
Oh, God, Grace!

15:12.412 --> 15:15.115
Can I see you
in the kitchen, please?
No!

15:15.215 --> 15:17.117
Oh! Ah! Ow, ow, ow.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.118
Hair! Hair! Hair!

15:18.218 --> 15:19.953
Hair! Hair!
Hair! Hair!

15:20.053 --> 15:21.621
Hair, hair,
hair, hair, ohh.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.957
How could you say that
to Clyde?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.558
How could you make me
play with him all night?

15:25.658 --> 15:26.559
Ow!
Ow!

15:26.659 --> 15:27.694
Ow!
Ow, let go!

15:27.794 --> 15:29.062
You let go!

15:29.162 --> 15:35.535
[groaning]

15:35.635 --> 15:38.671
All right...

15:38.771 --> 15:40.040
Count of three.
Okay.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.675
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.545
Ow!

15:45.645 --> 15:48.615
Would it have killed you
to be a little nice to him?

15:48.715 --> 15:51.084
What is wrong with you?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.386
You have not been
this obsessed

15:53.486 --> 15:55.222
with a gray-haired man

15:55.322 --> 15:59.692
since you discovered
Anderson Cooper!

15:59.792 --> 16:02.262
He is a lovely old gay man.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.131
And when I am his age

16:04.231 --> 16:06.099
and living alone
in a crummy apartment

16:06.199 --> 16:07.200
with a 19-year-old cat,

16:08.101 --> 16:09.402
who is either really sleepy
or long dead,

16:09.502 --> 16:12.305
I hope that someone
will be kind to me.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.108
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.644
You think--you think
you're gonna be Clyde?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.579
Is that what this
is all about?

16:19.679 --> 16:20.680
How do you know
that I won't?

16:20.780 --> 16:22.149
[sighs]

16:22.249 --> 16:25.018
I...

16:25.118 --> 16:27.554
I saw this old photo of him
on a beach.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.423
It could have been me.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.994
Except for the Korean War
going on in the background.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.435
Will, that's absurd.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.637
You're not Clyde.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.039
There is no way

16:46.139 --> 16:48.775
that you will ever
age that well.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.716
And there's
another reason why...

16:56.816 --> 16:58.685
you're not him.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.788
'Cause I'll have you?

17:01.888 --> 17:03.090
That's right.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.425
And I ain't
going anywhere.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.726
So you got it?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.697
You will never be a lonely
old gay man like Clyde.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.632
(Clyde)
Excuse me.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.304
I'm so sorry.
For everything.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.772
And I--I'm--

17:19.872 --> 17:22.742
I was wrong to assume
that you're lonely.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.711
Oh, I'm lonely.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.648
Heck, I leave my door unlocked
in hopes of getting robbed.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.484
But I'm not gay.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.754
You're not?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.723
[chuckling]
No, no.
I was married once.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.758
To a beautiful doctor.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.793
She, uh, traveled a lot
for work,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.163
and when she had an affair
with a colleague,

17:43.263 --> 17:46.166
I-I ended it.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.401
I've been alone
ever since.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.570
Wow.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.305
He's really not me.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.108
He's you, Grace.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.412
Did you hear that, Rob?

17:59.512 --> 18:00.780
He's Grace!

18:01.814 --> 18:03.450
That's crazy!

18:03.550 --> 18:04.684
Wait a minute,
if you're not gay,

18:05.718 --> 18:06.453
why are you getting meals
from Project Angel Food?

18:06.553 --> 18:09.556
Why not?
It's food, and it's free.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.724
Oh, my God, he is me.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.697
I have great news, baby.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.699
I talked with Stan.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.734
I told him I felt that I
was a better man for you

18:21.834 --> 18:23.203
than he is,
and he said,

18:23.303 --> 18:24.837
"Okay."

18:24.937 --> 18:27.707
He did?

18:27.807 --> 18:31.611
I promise you
I'll never fake my death.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.749
When I kill myself,
it's gonna be for real.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.651
And I'm gonna
take you with me.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.891
That's so romantic.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.728
Is that true, Jackie?

18:48.828 --> 18:49.862
He did.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.232
I remember, because
right after he said it,

18:53.266 --> 18:55.168
we discovered an Asian man
trapped underneath him.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.809
So you're okay now
with me and mama?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.846
Sure. If Stan
wants you to have her,

19:06.946 --> 19:07.847
then you can have her.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.549
Oh...listen.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.451
I was talking like
she's a thing.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.752
I'm sorry.

19:12.852 --> 19:16.356
It's yours, take it.
You have my blessing.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.925
Baby, now there's nothing
standing in our way.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.261
Oh, I'm so happy,
darling.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.463
Hmm. So...

19:23.563 --> 19:26.733
Stanley just let me go
without even a fight.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.903
Well, I guess everything's
Peaches and Herb.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.905
All right,
now if you'll excuse me,

19:33.005 --> 19:35.275
I'm gonna run to the Bronx
and set something on fire.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.909
You know,
because I'm so happy!

19:42.849 --> 19:44.684
Hello, Stanley.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.286
Don't talk!

19:46.386 --> 19:48.955
I have something to say.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.292
Oh, Stanley.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.594
How could you?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.797
Wasn't it enough
that you left me?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.667
Wasn't it enough that I was
the last one to know

20:00.767 --> 20:02.802
that you weren't dead?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.404
But no.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.939
No, you have the gall
to just let me go

20:07.039 --> 20:08.741
without even a fight.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.777
You fleshy bastard.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.348
Yeah, you're ready
to just toss me aside

20:15.448 --> 20:18.951
like some meaningless fling
or unattractive baby.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.954
No.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.324
How dare you?

20:24.424 --> 20:25.992
Good-bye, Stan.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.227
After what you've done,

20:28.328 --> 20:29.796
there is nothing
you could say

20:29.896 --> 20:31.398
that would ever win me back.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.533
[steam hisses]

20:36.336 --> 20:37.337
Oh, Stanley!

20:38.538 --> 20:40.907
[laughing]
Oh, Stanley.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.008
Ow, a turkey leg!

20:42.108 --> 20:43.310
