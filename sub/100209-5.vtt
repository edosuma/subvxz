WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:05.506
LAINEY: Back in the '90s
before schools focused on
the well-rounded student,

00:05.539 --> 00:08.676
William Penn Academy
only cared about one thing,
sports.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.612
Unfortunately, the same
was not true for the Arts.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.081
Big news, theater kids!

00:13.114 --> 00:14.782
I'm the new director
of the school musical!

00:14.815 --> 00:16.084
Where's Ms. Cinoman?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.586
Actually, she wrote
a play that's going
to be on Broadway.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.621
Well, uh,
not on Broadway.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.291
It's more of
an off-Broadway production.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.493
In Tennessee.
What play did
she pick for us?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.161
Got all the info right here
in the binder

00:27.195 --> 00:28.729
she threw in my driveway
as she drove by.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.200
Looks like it's
The Frogs by Aristophanes?

00:32.233 --> 00:33.567
(ALL GROAN)

00:33.601 --> 00:35.569
They only picked it
'cause it's old and free,

00:35.603 --> 00:37.371
and theater gets, like,
no money from the school.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.539
This makes no sense.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.441
You're in the best
prep school in Philly.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.310
For sports.
Not theater.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.045
How do you not know
any of this?
You went here.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.881
Because we did Phantom.
That show made me
want to be a singer.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.817
We've complained
to Mr. Glascott.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.220
Nothing happens.
Until now.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.155
Time for me
to talk to him
and fix this.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.023
You can't fix this.
Why not?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.825
When I went here,
we did Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.827
That play was huge for me.
What happened?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.329
Ms. Cinoman paid for it
out of pocket.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.131
The smoke machines?
The catering?

01:03.164 --> 01:05.199
That helicopter we had
in Miss Saigon?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.835
Yep, so your only choice
is to do something
old-timey and free

01:07.868 --> 01:09.503
or a musical
without the singing.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.172
You literally need music
for a musical.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.906
Have you seen
the smash stage show STOMP?

01:12.940 --> 01:16.009
They use mops and buckets
and garbage-can lids as drums.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.078
They slap their faces.
It's magical.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.080
You want my kids
to play garbage
and whack their faces?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.349
That's your answer?

01:21.382 --> 01:24.252
Look, our money goes to the
more important departments.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.653
Like what?
(HORN HONKS)

01:25.686 --> 01:27.355
Lovin' the new wheels,
Glascott!

01:27.388 --> 01:29.823
It really helps to
show off the grounds
to potential recruits

01:29.857 --> 01:31.259
like Roxborough Ronnie here.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.460
What the hell?

01:32.493 --> 01:34.862
Coach Mellor gets an absurd
helmet-mobile and recruits,

01:34.895 --> 01:37.097
and I gotta get my kids
to slap their faces
to the beat?

01:37.131 --> 01:40.868
You do know that sports
is the only way we raise
money for this school, right?

01:40.901 --> 01:42.102
What about all
our alumni in the arts?

01:42.136 --> 01:44.172
I bet they
donate plenty.
No.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.875
Our artsy-fartsy graduates
are too busy making
hemp ponchos

01:47.908 --> 01:49.610
in their parents' basements
to donate anything

01:49.643 --> 01:51.579
other than their blood
for burrito money.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.846
It's sad but true.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.115
How are the parents
at this school
okay with any of this?

01:55.149 --> 01:58.552
They all know if they have
a kid that excels in the arts
to go to Germantown Friends.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.888
Pbht. More like
Germantown Farts.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.123
(LAUGHS) Boom!

02:03.157 --> 02:05.659
That's the kind of
sharp wit we need
at this school, Ronnie!

02:06.760 --> 02:08.696
Godspeed, boys!

02:08.729 --> 02:11.599
* One of these days
You're gonna get outta here

02:11.632 --> 02:14.702
* Live your life
and finally be free

02:14.735 --> 02:17.571
* Go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do

02:17.605 --> 02:21.375
* Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" *

02:21.409 --> 02:24.245
LAINEY:
It was February 13th,
1990-something,

02:24.278 --> 02:27.381
day one of the most
awkward class every kid
was forced to take.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.617
Hello, and welcome to
the state-mandated

02:29.650 --> 02:30.684
boys' Health class.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.654
Today's lesson, JAR.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.823
"J" stands for jock.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.159
Wear it to keep
your nuggets safe.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.395
What about, you know,
girls and stuff?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.231
Is "JAR" spelled with a "G"?

02:43.264 --> 02:44.598
No!

02:44.632 --> 02:46.634
"A" is for Aerosol.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.303
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, John, are you busy?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.671
Please, my door
is always open.

02:50.704 --> 02:54.342
Except when I take my 11:00
break to eat my Kraft Singles.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.476
That's my time.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.610
Uh, so, listen,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.446
I don't want to step
on any toes,

02:58.479 --> 03:00.748
uh, but I really think
the boys' Health class

03:00.781 --> 03:02.450
needs to be longer
than ten seconds

03:02.483 --> 03:04.252
and not include
the word "nuggets."

03:04.285 --> 03:06.287
Look at you tattling on
old man Mattis.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.955
John, it's the '90s.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.458
I mean, these kids have
real fears and concerns,

03:10.491 --> 03:13.761
and as teachers, it's our job
to provide them with answers.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.928
I'll talk to the guy.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.664
It's not gonna be
an easy conversation.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.032
Herb Mattis, report to
my office immediately.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.934
No. I didn't mean
do it here with me.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.803
He'll know who tattled.
Relax.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.506
If anyone can grow
and change with the times,

03:25.539 --> 03:26.840
it's good ol' Herb.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.208
I quit.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.544
But it's the middle
of the school year.
You can't just leave.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.812
Good luck, narc.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.347
Hey, I'm not a narc.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.815
I'm a tattletale.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.350
Which is cute
and harmless.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.619
Well, looks like you just
tattled your way into

03:38.652 --> 03:40.020
teaching the boys'
Health class.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.389
You know what?
I'll do it.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.156
Well, I admire
your bravery.

03:43.190 --> 03:46.327
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's 11:00 on the dot.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.928
LAINEY: As CB
took over Health class,

03:47.961 --> 03:50.197
my plan to help
the theater kids
was underway.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.566
Hey, you got a sec?
It's super important.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.034
(GROANS)
Awesome.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.169
So, can you build me
a forest in ancient Greece

03:56.203 --> 03:58.005
for less than 10 bucks?
No problem.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.239
It's gotta be blue
and yellow,

03:59.273 --> 04:00.541
'cause that's
the school colors

04:00.574 --> 04:02.410
and the only paints
we have.
(GROANS)

04:02.443 --> 04:04.077
Stupid Mellor
sapping all our money.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.646
It's bullcrap.
It is what it is.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.348
Around here,
football pays the rent.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.216
Wait... Rent!

04:09.249 --> 04:10.984
Oh, my God.
That's the answer.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.420
We're gonna put on
my favorite musical.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.588
Is it The Wiz?
No. Rent.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.357
There's a show
called Rent?

04:16.390 --> 04:18.326
It's hip and young
and speaks to teenagers.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.760
One question,
how you gonna pay for it?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.430
I'll just do the Cinoman
and charge it all
on my credit cards.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.432
I really insist you
don't spend your own money.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.434
But, unlike her,
I've picked a musical

04:26.467 --> 04:28.001
that's guaranteed
to sell out.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.603
I'll make all the money
back and more.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.705
Mmm. That kinda
sorta makes sense.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.307
So you'll put
money in, too?
No.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.077
Hey, Coach!
We're coming for you.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.412
You're coming to
the game, huh?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.548
Fantastic!
But you better hurry

04:40.581 --> 04:42.550
'cause tickets are selling
like protein powder.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.952
I mean,
we're taking you on.
This is war.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.520
Oh, I know it's war.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.957
And you have my word,
our school is going to
destroy Germantown Friends.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.727
No, wait. The war
is between me and you.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.463
I was determined
to beat sports,

04:55.496 --> 04:57.297
and CB was gonna use
his cool style

04:57.331 --> 04:58.866
to enlighten young,
curious minds.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.701
What up, my homies?

05:00.734 --> 05:03.704
It's time to kick it and chat
about our changing bods.

05:03.737 --> 05:07.074
This Health class is about
to get a makeover, dogs.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.876
Totally informal rap session.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.813
Just us boys
dropping knowledge
on the b and b's.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.915
Yes, we have
our first question.
Hit me.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.418
I'm very interested in
getting jiggy with it,

05:17.451 --> 05:19.487
but how does one
exactly get jiggy?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.288
Wow. That's quite
the question.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.457
Maybe we can
build up to that.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.225
All right, anyone else?

05:25.258 --> 05:26.794
I would love some
afternoon delight,

05:26.827 --> 05:29.062
but, like,
any time of the day.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.732
That's more of an alarming
statement than a question.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.967
What's it mean when
a baby's got back?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.403
Okay, lotta stuff
flying at me here.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.806
I would like a lady
to pour some sugar on me.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.940
How do I make
that happen?

05:39.973 --> 05:42.142
You guys listen to
a lot of pop music.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.578
Is there anyone who has
a question that isn't related

05:44.612 --> 05:46.680
to a filthy,
inappropriate song?

05:47.948 --> 05:48.982
Lay it on me, pal.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.118
So,
when I'm with a girl,

05:51.151 --> 05:53.253
is it possible, you know,
to go (BLEEP)

05:53.286 --> 05:55.956
to my (BLEEP)
real fast (BLEEP)

05:55.989 --> 05:58.992
I'm (BLEEP)
like (BLEEP)

05:59.026 --> 06:02.996
not (BLEEP)
but (BLEEP)
ticklin' (BLEEP)?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.365
(BELL RINGS)

06:05.399 --> 06:06.834
Okay, class dismissed.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.538
Go.
Frolic in the sunshine.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.440
Be the children
that you still are.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.142
LAINEY: As CB failed
to deliver the goods
in Health class,

06:15.175 --> 06:18.178
I was having some problems
making Rent.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.549
(OFF-KEY)
* Nine-hundred ninety-five
thousand two-hundred... *

06:21.582 --> 06:23.984
* One thousand
two million thousand... *

06:24.017 --> 06:28.355
* One dozen six-hundred
eight-thousand minutes *

06:28.388 --> 06:31.692
These poor kids have no idea
how much time is in a year.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.027
They're not good.
You guys are so good!

06:34.061 --> 06:35.796
Take five.
I tried to explain.

06:35.829 --> 06:38.031
The football team wins
because they have money,

06:38.065 --> 06:40.300
they have facilities,
they have scholarships.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.869
Scholarships?
Yeah.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.537
Can't win without
the best players.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.574
How do you think deep thinkers
like Roxborough Ronnie
end up here?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.241
Then that's
what we'll do.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.910
They have ringers?
So will we.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.145
The board's position
is pretty clear.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.515
We don't do any
arts-related scholarships.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.083
I get it,
football brings in money.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.686
But you guys aren't
tapping into a market
bigger than football.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.589
Bigger than football?
Let's see.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.858
Well, I know
it's not soccer.
Hollywood.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.259
Right now,
there's only one alumni

07:06.293 --> 07:07.761
from William Penn
who made it out there.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.498
Class of '71,
former drama club president

07:10.531 --> 07:12.766
and character actor
Robert Picardo

07:12.800 --> 07:14.935
who plays a hologram on
Star Trek: Voyager.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.537
I love him!

07:16.570 --> 07:18.271
Look, with enough
Robert Picardos,

07:18.305 --> 07:19.940
this school could be
put on the map

07:19.973 --> 07:22.209
as a training ground
for amazing actors,

07:22.242 --> 07:25.746
musicians, singers,
who go on to make millions.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.616
You just got permission
to give an arts scholarship,
lady.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.218
Let me talk to Mellor,
and you are good to go.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.385
(QUIETLY) Yes.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.121
I hope you're happy,
Lainey Lewis.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.556
Thanks to you,
our team won't get

07:35.589 --> 07:36.790
that third-string
nose tackle

07:36.824 --> 07:38.225
I was gonna poach
from Episcopal.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.860
Third string?
He's not even gonna start?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.194
You know what
this means, right?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.063
This is war.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.566
Yeah, I said that already.
Really? I don't remember that.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.434
I literally said
to your face,
"This is war."

07:47.467 --> 07:50.070
Eh, I thought you were
just making a sad joke
with no punch line.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.138
Here's the punch line.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.273
You just lost your backup's
backup nose tackle,

07:53.306 --> 07:55.643
and I got a five-star recruit
to bring down the house.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.779
Mmm, well, we shall see.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.514
We shall see!

08:02.482 --> 08:04.284
Not an exit.
It's just painted
on the wall.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.054
War!

08:07.087 --> 08:09.623
LAINEY: CB had failed teaching
the boys about their bodies,

08:09.657 --> 08:12.459
so he decided to think outside
the box... With a box.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.095
Before you is
an anonymous question box.

08:15.128 --> 08:19.099
Drop in any Health class
related queries that
you have right now

08:19.132 --> 08:20.433
and I will
answer them all.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.335
Seriously?
Any questions?

08:22.369 --> 08:26.139
I've realized that as long
as I don't put a face
to the horror show,

08:26.173 --> 08:28.842
I can handle
anything you guys
throw at me.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.143
So let's give it a shot.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.312
**

08:35.616 --> 08:38.085
Wow, that filled up fast.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.287
Okay, first anonymous
question.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.790
How long does
it take to sh...

08:44.291 --> 08:46.259
Nope! Next!

08:46.293 --> 08:49.096
And... Doo, doo-doo doo-doo.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.031
No. Next again.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.199
Nope!

08:52.232 --> 08:53.300
(CHUCKLES) No!

08:53.333 --> 08:54.401
Mmm-mmm.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.703
I cannot unsee this.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.170
Why?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.371
(GAGS)

08:58.405 --> 09:00.808
I can't do it. Ugh.

09:00.841 --> 09:01.975
I can't do this.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.878
There's something wrong
with those kids.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.247
There's really not.
Just look in the box.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.682
Charlie, you were right.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.684
It's our job as teachers
to provide

09:10.718 --> 09:13.053
the best information
for all of our students

09:13.086 --> 09:15.488
to make sure that they're
safe and responsible...

09:15.522 --> 09:18.225
Sweet Lord!
You have to answer this?

09:19.927 --> 09:20.928
I'm not gonna.

09:22.429 --> 09:23.731
Can a person
even do that?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.633
You tell me.
I don't think they can.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.734
Well, maybe with help?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.301
Why would they even
ask that?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.837
I told them they could
ask me anything.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.739
You need
to burn this box,

09:31.772 --> 09:34.041
and I need to go
back to church.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.009
No, what we need
is Mr. Mattis back.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.878
Just get advice
from Liz Flemming.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.713
She teaches
the girls' Health class,

09:39.747 --> 09:41.481
and she does
a fantastic job.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.718
Health class will now be
taught by Ms. Flemming.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.287
Thank you for your time,
and best of luck.

* You're living in America
LAINEY: CB had
admitted defeat,

09:50.758 --> 09:52.726
but in the war between
arts and athletics,

09:52.760 --> 09:55.663
I was about to
declare victory

10:03.070 --> 10:04.404
All right, boys,
bring it on in.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.873
Let's station up and pair off.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.107
Whoa, whoa.
What the hell, dude?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.341
We're in the middle
of practice.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.277
So are we.
This is our new
weight room.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.412
Good luck.
No, it isn't.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.613
What can I say?

10:13.647 --> 10:15.348
You inspired me
to go to Ball

10:15.382 --> 10:17.851
and remind him we'd never win
the big homecoming game

10:17.885 --> 10:20.220
unless we had a proper
weight training space.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.889
You can't just
take my stage.

10:21.922 --> 10:22.956
And I'm not.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.792
But I do get the rest
of the gymnatorium.

10:24.825 --> 10:28.628
So it looks like we'll be
building mass and girth
right next to you.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.297
Well, you think
a few weights
are gonna stop us?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.032
(SCOFFS)
The show must go on.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.333
From the top, Ian!

10:33.366 --> 10:34.735
All right,
let's bang it out, men.

Just ignore the weird grunts
and horrible groans.

You got this.
I want your quads
screaming for mercy,

10:46.313 --> 10:47.981
and there will be no mercy.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.951

That's it! Up, up, up!

There you go, baby!
Two more!

10:52.753 --> 10:54.922
Ah! Can you please
tell them to quiet down?

10:54.955 --> 10:55.989
COACH MELLOR: No can do.

You got it.

All right, ladies,
let's dive into moon cycles.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.135
Great mother
of Madeleine Albright.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.503
What is the meaning
of this?

12:16.536 --> 12:18.505
CB said we have to learn
body business from you.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.474
Okay, the boys and girls
do separate Health classes.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.642
Okay, but why?

12:22.675 --> 12:25.145
'Cause we talk about
the female form

12:25.178 --> 12:28.548
and other sensitive subjects
that require privacy
and trust.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.318
A safe atmosphere like that
sounds refreshing.
Hmm.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.954
Also, do you cover how to
unhook a bra in a hot tub?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.256
Get out!

12:36.289 --> 12:39.292
So your solution
was to dump it
in Ms. Flemming's lap?

12:39.326 --> 12:41.361
In my defense,
her lack of fear

12:41.394 --> 12:42.996
or any
real human emotions

12:43.030 --> 12:45.232
really makes her
an excellent Health teacher.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.067
You can compliment me
all you want.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.601
I'm still not taking over
your class.

12:48.635 --> 12:51.671
Nor should you have to.
Look, we're teachers.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.874
That means that
we dig down deep

12:53.907 --> 12:56.043
because educators
can conquer anything.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.945
Then it's settled.
You're a good man, John.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.447
Wait, what?
No, I didn't mean
I'll do it.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.417
Thank you again for coming in
to talk to the drama kids,

13:04.451 --> 13:06.419
Hollywood's
Robert Picardo.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.555
My pleasure.
And you can
just call me Robert.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.689
I live in Encino.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.258
Wait, like Encino Man
with Pauly Shore?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.592
Mmm-hmm.
Do you know him?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.261
Oh, because all actors
know each other?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.096
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah, I know him.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.899
Well, I am just so happy
you came back as an alumni.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.035
Really helps my case
that the Arts program
at this school is worth it.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.237
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

13:25.172 --> 13:26.806
Where's our set?
Didn't you hear?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.075
We took it down
for the pep rally.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.943
What?
I talked to
Earl Ball again,

13:29.977 --> 13:32.412
made him realize
we'd get a better turnout
for the big game

13:32.445 --> 13:34.447
if we held
a pep rally in here
on Friday.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.583
Friday?
That's when our play opens.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.286
Don't worry,
your production's
been moved to The Pit.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.255
The Pit?
That's where the elementary
school kids eat their snack.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.456
Well, you should've
thought of that

13:43.490 --> 13:44.824
before you stole
my quarterback

13:44.858 --> 13:46.759
and turned him
into Mandy Patinkin.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.295
But this musical
has to be a hit.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.297
I got Robert Picardo here
to sign autographs.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.065
I am merely a vessel.

13:52.099 --> 13:55.102
I also reminded Earl of
the very generous pro athletes

13:55.135 --> 13:56.469
that will be attending
the game

13:56.503 --> 13:59.106
like Mark Gubicza
and Dave Singletary.

13:59.139 --> 14:02.342
Wait, those jackass bullies
are gonna be here?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.643
I gotta go.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.346
Robert, no! You're famous!
They'll pretend
to like you now!

14:08.781 --> 14:10.150
I just lost my play
to a pep rally.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.119
Hey,
it's nothing personal.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.320
No need to cry at all.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.322
Yeah, there is, dude.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.157
I spent my own money
on that play.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.291
Why would you do that?

14:18.325 --> 14:20.193
There was no budget.
I didn't have a choice.

14:20.227 --> 14:23.196
Your choice was not to
pay for it yourself.
It's just a play.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.198
It's not just a play!

14:25.232 --> 14:27.100
Look, back in high school,
I was lost.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.669
I didn't care
about anything.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.871
But then a whole new world
opened up for me
when I did a musical.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.041
I didn't know that.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.708
Do you have any idea
what it means to a kid

14:35.742 --> 14:37.310
to find something they're
passionate about?

14:37.344 --> 14:40.347
Of course. That's what
I want my athletes
to find in sports.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.916
Well, I wanted my theater kids
to find that, too.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.785
But it's not gonna happen
'cause you won the war.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.020
I hope it feels good.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.493
LAINEY: Mr. Glascott
was going to attempt
to reach the young men

14:53.526 --> 14:55.028
in Health class
with a new approach,

14:55.062 --> 14:56.496
misdirection and diversion.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.831
All right, boys,
who's ready to learn?

14:58.865 --> 15:00.033
I sure am.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.002
Wait, are we having
a third teacher in two days?

15:02.035 --> 15:06.673
For sure. Now let's delve
into your anonymous questions
about the human body.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.708
Here's one.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.077
"What is a hug?"

15:10.110 --> 15:11.878
Aww, that's a good question.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.347
That's what two friends do
platonically.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.715
Oh, here's another good one.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.850

"I have about
my changing body?"

(CHUCKLES) Yes.
Yes, you should.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.224
Um, I don't think
these are our questions.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.993
Oh, sure they are.
Like this one.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.594
"I think girls are nice."

15:27.627 --> 15:29.562
(CHUCKLES)
Hey, me, too.

15:29.596 --> 15:33.166
Screw this. I'll just learn
about this stuff from the
older kids on the bus.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.867
Oh, God, no,
the school bus?

15:34.901 --> 15:36.369
That yellow tin can
is filled

15:36.403 --> 15:38.105
with tall tales
and misinformation.

15:38.138 --> 15:42.209
Clearly, it's up to me to give
you the answers that you need.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.578
Or I could use this.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.781
You mean a computer's
gonna tell us stuff?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.783
Oh, yeah.
The school just paid money

15:50.817 --> 15:53.953
to connect us to this
new thing called the
World Wide Spiderweb.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.388
Pretty sure that's not
what it's called.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.524
You can type in
your questions...

15:57.557 --> 16:00.027
(KEYS CLACK)
...and let the robots
inside answer it.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.562

anything we ask it?

Oh, no.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.042
You quit the class
already?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.943
Quite the opposite.
I solved the class.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.578
I'm letting all those boys
get answers

16:18.611 --> 16:20.147
from something called
"surfing" the Internet.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.449
The Internet?
That's the thing
they had on Dateline.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.152
Your panicked tone
is suggesting
I made a grave error.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.719
Do you have any idea
what's on the Internet?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.455
Colorful graphs
and weather updates?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.323
And also everything else.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.292
Those kids can see
everything.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.561
I thought the Internet was
supposed to help the future!

16:34.594 --> 16:35.828
That'll just ruin it!

16:35.862 --> 16:37.130
We gotta stop
those kids.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.300
(SLOW-MO) Go, go, go!

16:40.333 --> 16:43.803
**

16:58.718 --> 17:00.953
Nooo!

17:03.656 --> 17:06.393
Stoop!

17:06.893 --> 17:08.328
Die!

17:08.361 --> 17:09.529
Wait,
what are you doing?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.798
Just unplug it.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.067
Oh.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.468
Well, we did it.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.869
Yeah.
We saved the children.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.306
You really didn't.
We typed in "getting jiggy"

17:19.339 --> 17:21.374
and all we saw was the top
of Will Smith's head.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.475
That's what
you looked up?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.177
We told you.
We don't know
what we're doing.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.245
CB: Neither do we.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.779
You don't know
how hard puberty is

17:26.813 --> 17:28.415
for an adult man
to teach children.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.283
It's true.
Nobody taught me this stuff.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.085
I just learned everything
on the playground.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.987
Well, get it together.
We need real help, man.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.623
Our bodies are all
weird and pimply.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.391
I got kicked out
of my boys choir!

17:38.425 --> 17:40.393
I had no warning
this would happen
to my voice.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.562
You think that's bad?
When I was in school,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.864
I had incredibly hairy
feet and arms.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.699
They called me
Teddy the Yeti.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.502
My name is John.
(LAUGHTER)

17:49.536 --> 17:51.671
I guess we forgot what
it's like to be in your shoes.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.173
We're sorry
we let you down.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.841
So... What now?

17:54.874 --> 17:55.942
So now we teach you.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.245
Together.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.012
Hey, everyone's
headed to the gym.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.314
Think you ought to
take a look-see.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.183
No way.
To them it's a pep rally,

18:03.216 --> 18:06.052
but to me it's the end of
everything I care about.
Hard pass.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.255
Sure, I understand
how you feel.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.056
Just the same,
you ought to take a look.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.558
I really think
you're gonna like it.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.760
**

18:13.793 --> 18:14.894
(CHUCKLES)

18:15.528 --> 18:18.097
**

18:18.898 --> 18:21.201
My stage, it's back.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.603
Attention Fighting Quakers,

18:23.636 --> 18:25.372
I know you're all here
for a pep rally,

18:25.405 --> 18:27.740
but there's more
to this school
than just sports.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.443
Turns out,
we got a damn good
drama club.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.514
These kids busted their butts
like it was the playoffs,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.015
and they deserve
our support...

18:36.048 --> 18:38.651
**

18:43.022 --> 18:48.395
* Five-hundred twenty-five
thousand six-hundred minutes

18:48.428 --> 18:53.933
* Five-hundred twenty-five
thousand moments so dear

18:53.966 --> 18:59.239
* Five-hundred twenty-five
thousand six-hundred minutes

18:59.272 --> 19:04.143
* How do you measure
Measure a year?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.545
* In daylights?

19:05.578 --> 19:06.846
* In sunsets?

19:06.879 --> 19:08.047

19:10.149 --> 19:15.188

in laughter, in strife?

19:15.222 --> 19:16.423
* Love

19:16.456 --> 19:17.624
Rick, wait.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.058
What you just did
was incredible.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.461
Yeah, maybe.
No need to make
a big thing of this.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.263
No, there really is.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.498
I mean, you won the war,
so why help me?

19:25.532 --> 19:26.933
Because there is no war.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.769
We're on the same side
and that's inspiring these
kids to be great.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.972
It doesn't matter if it's
on a field or on a stage.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.941
Plus, you put up
your own money.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.909
I know.
I won't do it again.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.811
Well, you won't have to.
I talked to Ball.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.112
We're gonna sell
that helmet cart,

19:40.146 --> 19:42.148
cut back on the budget
a little.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.251
Next time, you can put on
any play you want.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.653
**

19:48.688 --> 19:50.156
Thank you.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.958
Okay.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.628
* The bridges he burned

19:55.662 --> 19:58.465
* Or the way that she died

19:58.498 --> 19:59.799
* It's time now to sing out

19:59.832 --> 20:01.067
LAINEY: Teachers
have tough jobs.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.803
For low pay and almost
no recognition.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.039
And sometimes it can feel
like the most impossible
job in the world.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.513
It involves challenges
that can seem overwhelming

20:13.546 --> 20:16.649
and sometimes
responsibilities
too heavy to bear.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.755
* Remember the love

20:22.789 --> 20:25.057
LAINEY: That's the great
thing about teachers.

20:25.091 --> 20:28.695
When we fall,
we have others right there
to pick us up.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.398
* Measure
Measure your life in love *

20:32.765 --> 20:34.567
LAINEY: Teachers are a team,

20:34.601 --> 20:37.937
and when we work together,
no one can defeat us.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.908
I'm Tim Meadows.
I play John Glascott.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.743
We're here with
the real John.
Hi.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.046
What are the challenges of
teaching kids about puberty?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.849
I used movies that... That
I thought would be helpful.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.518
The Ladies Man? That movie?
Did you ever use that?

20:51.551 --> 20:53.886
(LAUGHS)
It's a good movie
to teach teens

20:53.920 --> 20:55.722
about the birds
and the bees.
Yeah, okay.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.757
What was your least favorite
part of the job?

20:57.790 --> 20:58.858
My least favorite part

20:58.891 --> 21:00.427
was actually dealing
with the parents.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.529
Ye... (LAUGHS)
The parents w-were tough.

21:02.562 --> 21:05.131
Is it weird being here?
Is this like the school?

21:05.164 --> 21:06.232
It looks a little bit
like it.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.334
Have you seen
your office?

21:07.367 --> 21:09.268
I have not.
Oh, it's very small.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.437
You're gonna be
disappointed.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.004
My office was very
small. Oh, yes!
Was it? Oh.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.074
How do you feel about
being portrayed
on television?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.944
To have you playing
my character,
I-I think is great.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.414
I was surprised to see we both
have the same actual hair.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.916
I can't grow any...
Anything else, so...
Me, either.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.952
(BOTH LAUGH)
