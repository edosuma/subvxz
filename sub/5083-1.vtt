02:42.912 --> 02:45.187
Breakfast is on the table.

02:49.619 --> 02:51.862
We're burning daylight.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.639
Come on. Let's go.

02:55.992 --> 02:59.231
- Zac.
- I'm coming.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.952
We gotta get this done by nightfall.

03:51.114 --> 03:53.137
Go on now.

04:18.241 --> 04:20.505
Mom, look.

04:24.447 --> 04:26.503
Look who got out.

04:28.618 --> 04:31.652
- Come here.
- I'm gonna go around this side.

04:43.159 --> 04:44.407
Come on.

04:47.754 --> 04:50.326
I got you girl. I got you.

04:51.598 --> 04:53.496
Yes.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.333
Okay, watch this.

05:25.041 --> 05:26.697
Is she asleep?

05:27.743 --> 05:31.347
- How'd you do that?
- It's a secret. I can't tell you.

05:31.447 --> 05:34.484
Come on. Please tell me.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.373
Okay.

05:38.488 --> 05:40.757
The first step...

05:41.057 --> 05:42.880
is catch!

05:51.934 --> 05:55.085
- You finish up this last bit.
- Yes, sir.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.411
Zac?

07:55.858 --> 07:57.581
Zac?

08:31.327 --> 08:33.664
Where do you think they're going?

08:34.864 --> 08:37.053
Who knows.

08:38.033 --> 08:40.623
I bet I could make it up there.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.073
No way. It's dark and too far away.

08:46.375 --> 08:49.579
You dare me? I bet I could.

08:49.679 --> 08:52.702
Oh, yeah? Even if you did, then what?

08:56.352 --> 08:58.344
I don't know.

09:00.156 --> 09:01.858
Anything.

09:02.658 --> 09:04.881
Meet other people.

09:06.529 --> 09:08.919
Maybe people like you and me.

09:14.570 --> 09:16.857
Would you go with me?

09:19.075 --> 09:22.523
Seems like everything I need
is already right here.

09:25.347 --> 09:28.457
Why would I wanna go someplace else?

10:01.751 --> 10:03.639
Oh, God.

10:09.759 --> 10:11.581
Breathe.

10:14.297 --> 10:16.652
Elizabeth, breathe.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.607
Come on.

10:57.856 --> 11:00.297
I know you two were out last night.

11:02.478 --> 11:05.324
And I know you were out there doing
what we all decided a long time ago

11:05.424 --> 11:07.670
would be best left behind.

11:09.552 --> 11:13.225
Now you've gone and drudged up
everything that comes along with it.

11:15.424 --> 11:19.949
So you can trust me when I tell you,
I catch you two doing that again...

11:20.930 --> 11:23.432
there's gonna be a price to pay.
You understand me?

11:23.532 --> 11:26.145
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

11:28.137 --> 11:32.024
Zac. I'll need your help
tending the horses this morning.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.710
Eva, you let your mother sleep.

11:34.810 --> 11:37.273
Come on out when you're done in here.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.829
<i>This thing we have...</i>

12:12.581 --> 12:15.307
<i>we never asked for it...</i>

12:18.354 --> 12:20.777
<i>but it's part of me.</i>

12:25.895 --> 12:28.384
<i>It always has been.</i>

12:33.502 --> 12:36.273
<i>But he doesn't see it that way.</i>

12:45.681 --> 12:48.204
<i>What is this place?</i>

12:50.252 --> 12:53.175
<i>Why are we here and not out there?</i>

12:56.775 --> 12:58.802
<i>It's almost like a dream.</i>

13:06.469 --> 13:08.625
<i>I want out...</i>

13:10.072 --> 13:12.328
<i>but the wall...</i>

13:17.012 --> 13:20.079
<i>Dad says it's to keep other people out.</i>

13:21.750 --> 13:24.537
<i>But I don't believe him anymore.</i>

13:25.621 --> 13:28.227
<i>We're the only ones here.</i>

13:34.730 --> 13:37.272
<i>I think it's just meant to keep us in.</i>

13:51.981 --> 13:54.070
Let's pray.

14:23.746 --> 14:26.739
- Dad? Dad?
- Mom? Mom?

14:26.839 --> 14:30.576
Zac, help. Grab her...

14:30.676 --> 14:32.966
Eva, pull the chair.

14:34.723 --> 14:36.959
That's it. Hold her legs.

14:37.059 --> 14:39.328
Don't let her thrash about.

14:39.628 --> 14:43.311
Easy. Easy.

14:46.402 --> 14:49.442
That's it. That's it.

14:58.347 --> 15:00.634
Nice and deep.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.488
All the way.

15:02.588 --> 15:04.620
You got it.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.823
You got it. That's it.

15:07.923 --> 15:09.812
That's it.

15:10.592 --> 15:12.461
That's it.

15:12.561 --> 15:15.645
Alright. Alright.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.901
You're in our home.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.237
You had a fit, okay?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.726
It wasn't a big one.

15:59.141 --> 16:00.530
Time for bed.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.508
- Is she okay?
- She'll be fine.

16:06.381 --> 16:08.517
Right now, she's gettin' ready for bed.

16:08.617 --> 16:11.407
Which is where you two should be. Come on.

16:38.013 --> 16:41.863
I had hoped we'd made it past all that.

16:45.354 --> 16:47.543
So did I.

16:55.831 --> 16:58.422
It was right before you were born.

17:01.136 --> 17:03.682
One of those summers where...

17:04.239 --> 17:07.175
cicadas were screaming all day long.

17:07.876 --> 17:10.194
Tons of 'em everywhere.

17:12.647 --> 17:16.074
I used to like to catch 'em,
keep 'em in jars.

17:18.186 --> 17:21.084
One day, I had a whole jar full.

17:21.824 --> 17:25.296
I went inside the kitchen
to show Mom and...

17:27.663 --> 17:30.319
she was just layin' there...

17:30.866 --> 17:33.157
shaking like that.

17:35.738 --> 17:39.567
I dropped the jar,
cicadas were flying everywhere.

17:42.845 --> 17:45.355
I kneeled down to help her...

17:46.081 --> 17:48.704
I put my hand on her belly...

17:49.251 --> 17:51.841
and everything just stood still.

17:55.757 --> 17:58.812
I could hear her heart
pounding in my head.

18:04.099 --> 18:06.422
Everything stopped.

18:10.472 --> 18:14.064
And just like that, boom,
everything went black.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.767
And I woke up outside in the front yard.

19:22.377 --> 19:26.047
- You waitin' to see if I have another?
- No. Sorry.

19:26.147 --> 19:31.207
It's alright. You're right to worry.
I don't know when it's coming either.

19:34.022 --> 19:37.015
But you know none of this is your fault.

19:39.061 --> 19:40.883
Right?

19:49.471 --> 19:51.193
Hey.

19:55.877 --> 19:59.118
Why don't you go out
and run around, go for a swim?

19:59.748 --> 20:01.750
I can handle dinner, okay?

20:01.850 --> 20:04.940
- Really?
- Yes, really.

20:05.621 --> 20:09.398
- Are you sure?
- Eva, go.

20:09.498 --> 20:11.180
Get!

22:18.787 --> 22:21.310
<i>I don't understand.</i>

22:26.995 --> 22:30.500
<i>What service is she to you in this state?</i>

22:36.304 --> 22:39.223
<i>What do I have to do to stop this?</i>

22:42.911 --> 22:45.314
<i>There was a time when I thought</i>

22:45.414 --> 22:47.082
<i>they might be...</i>

22:47.182 --> 22:51.781
<i>gifted by you in some way
with some divine purpose.</i>

23:05.033 --> 23:07.656
<i>But I'm scared.</i>

23:08.870 --> 23:11.306
<i>They together might be</i>

23:11.406 --> 23:13.805
<i>somethin' against your desire...</i>

23:13.905 --> 23:16.211
<i>somethin' worse.</i>

23:16.611 --> 23:19.669
Come on, keep goin'. Now!

23:25.387 --> 23:28.950
<i>And I am asking for your help.</i>

23:29.341 --> 23:32.665
<i>I'm asking for clarity.</i>

24:50.739 --> 24:53.622
Zac, you go ahead, wait in your room.

25:14.629 --> 25:17.452
What were you two doin' out there?

25:18.333 --> 25:20.640
We were just playing.

25:35.317 --> 25:37.606
How did you get out?

25:41.022 --> 25:43.692
Well, you're done with this.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.461
Turn around. Face the wall.

25:46.561 --> 25:48.988
- Why?
- Move. Let's go. Come on.

25:49.088 --> 25:51.199
- Dad...
- Come on.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.022
Dad.

25:57.572 --> 25:59.964
You hold still.

26:14.723 --> 26:17.325
Don't you dare move.

26:24.599 --> 26:26.695
Stand up!

26:28.570 --> 26:31.139
I put my trust in you...

26:31.239 --> 26:32.974
and you let me down.

26:33.274 --> 26:37.099
Get up against the wall. Get!

26:38.747 --> 26:40.036
I'm sorry, I know...

26:42.918 --> 26:44.486
Be still now.

26:44.586 --> 26:47.822
I'm gonna talk to Eva, we're not gonna...

26:47.922 --> 26:50.124
Goddamn you.

27:00.635 --> 27:03.371
Dad, I'm sorry. Dad!

27:04.607 --> 27:08.533
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid! Stupid!

27:10.245 --> 27:13.290
Eva, we're not doing this anymore!

28:22.150 --> 28:24.040
Eva?

28:25.854 --> 28:27.576
Zac?

28:55.616 --> 28:57.839
Are you okay?

28:59.087 --> 29:00.622
- I hate him.
- I know.

29:00.722 --> 29:03.792
- I hate him so much.
- I know. He's just scared.

29:03.892 --> 29:06.381
I have to go help Eva.

29:20.642 --> 29:24.699
- This won't happen again.
- I'm so sorry.

29:25.346 --> 29:28.703
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.719
I'm sorry.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.122
What is wrong with you?

29:49.837 --> 29:53.675
What are you trying to teach them?
Answer me.

29:54.175 --> 29:57.279
They're children, Daniel.
They're our children.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.114
They're more than that.

29:59.784 --> 30:03.952
Yes, they are. But that doesn't mean
you can treat them like that.

30:04.052 --> 30:07.038
- No one deserves this.
- What am I supposed to do?

30:07.388 --> 30:11.927
They don't listen. And it's starting
to take its toll on all of us.

30:12.327 --> 30:14.325
I know you're scared.

30:14.425 --> 30:17.361
I'm scared too. I'm horrified.

30:17.461 --> 30:20.639
- I might be leaving you all sooner than...
- Don't you talk like that. Please!

30:20.739 --> 30:25.206
It's the truth! And it has absolutely
nothing to do with them!

30:25.306 --> 30:29.325
I will let them down
when I am good and ready.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.369
I already did.

30:35.650 --> 30:37.472
Elizabeth.

30:38.353 --> 30:40.190
Elizabeth!

30:59.007 --> 31:01.063
Are you okay?

31:03.544 --> 31:06.268
We can't, Eva.

31:07.515 --> 31:09.605
What do you mean?

31:11.652 --> 31:15.002
It's not worth it.
We have to do what he says.

31:17.258 --> 31:19.527
You'll get over it. Come on.

31:19.627 --> 31:22.045
Eva, I'm serious.

31:27.535 --> 31:29.258
Fine.

32:58.860 --> 33:01.348
Come on, get out of here. Let's go.

33:05.533 --> 33:08.490
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:09.137 --> 33:13.494
- I was thinking about goin' swimming.
- That's nice, but I can't.

33:15.443 --> 33:18.666
- Zac, come on.
- What, Eva?

33:20.815 --> 33:22.905
You're just gonna live like this?

33:24.085 --> 33:25.453
Come on.

33:25.553 --> 33:28.859
- I got work to do.
- Seriously? Zac!

33:29.374 --> 33:32.873
I'm done with this.
I'm not doing that again.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.304
You alright?

33:58.419 --> 34:00.842
Did you fall out of your nest?

34:48.168 --> 34:51.081
I really believed we could make something.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.593
I mean... could make a life.

35:05.119 --> 35:08.183
Live the way we wanna live. Raise...

35:08.283 --> 35:11.285
kids, the way we wanna raise kids.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.356
This is everything I ever feared.

35:22.103 --> 35:25.426
All those stories were true.

35:26.073 --> 35:28.262
It's hard.

35:29.042 --> 35:32.767
Your children aren't trying
to make loving them difficult.

35:33.281 --> 35:37.038
All they ever wanted was to be loved.
They're children.

36:33.474 --> 36:35.288
Zac?

36:36.811 --> 36:38.666
Zac?

37:23.858 --> 37:27.746
Alright, I'm right here. Hey.

37:29.630 --> 37:31.386
Okay.

37:40.574 --> 37:42.754
I need you to breathe for me.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.619
Breathe for me. Come on, now.

37:49.917 --> 37:52.741
Come on, now. You breathe for me. Come on.

37:57.892 --> 38:00.694
Come on, now. Don't... Elizabeth.

38:00.794 --> 38:03.317
Come on. Breathe.

38:13.407 --> 38:14.863
Elizabeth.

38:26.454 --> 38:28.802
You got this.

38:30.724 --> 38:33.378
You can do that. Come on.

39:11.198 --> 39:13.248
What's going on?

39:20.975 --> 39:23.031
Your mother...

39:28.415 --> 39:30.505
What happened?

39:40.461 --> 39:42.850
Where's your sister at?

39:46.901 --> 39:49.344
I don't know. She's not in her room?

40:01.182 --> 40:04.206
Zac, I need you to go ahead
and get in the closet.

40:07.888 --> 40:10.791
- Why?
- I can't do this right now.

40:11.091 --> 40:14.483
You go on. We can talk about it later.

40:34.782 --> 40:36.804
Hey, Dad.

40:41.956 --> 40:44.079
Hey, Dad! What's goin' on?

41:56.163 --> 41:59.466
You go ahead and close
the door behind you.

41:59.566 --> 42:01.389
Go on.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.902
What is it?

42:15.949 --> 42:18.139
She's gone.

42:24.692 --> 42:26.668
- Stop.
- I wanna be with her.

42:30.114 --> 42:32.608
I should've done this a long time ago.

42:34.468 --> 42:36.424
Don't make this any harder.

42:37.921 --> 42:40.182
Get away from that window.

42:42.877 --> 42:44.565
Come on.

42:46.113 --> 42:49.831
Eva! Eva!

42:50.918 --> 42:54.542
Eva! Eva!

42:59.426 --> 43:02.249
What's going on? Let me out!

44:42.663 --> 44:45.165
What do you want from me?

44:45.265 --> 44:47.688
What do you want?

47:20.554 --> 47:23.644
I fear for your soul, Eva.

48:00.828 --> 48:03.579
Zac! Zac!

48:03.930 --> 48:07.244
Let go or your fingers are coming with it.

48:09.636 --> 48:12.742
Now you gotta be thirsty,
so do not spill this.

48:15.942 --> 48:17.831
Come on.

48:18.311 --> 48:20.200
Good boy.

48:22.382 --> 48:26.457
Oh, it's gonna be different now, Zac.
It's gonna be better.

49:06.927 --> 49:10.633
You're gonna be okay, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be okay.

50:48.462 --> 50:50.584
I'm sorry.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.548
There you are.

50:57.371 --> 50:59.227
Are you alright?

51:01.841 --> 51:04.012
It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

51:04.544 --> 51:06.713
Let's see if we can get you
back to your room.

51:06.813 --> 51:08.615
Don't touch me.

51:08.715 --> 51:12.326
It's okay. John... I need help here.

52:04.187 --> 52:09.246
I hope that by now what you're feeling
is something different than anger.

52:17.484 --> 52:21.922
You can go ahead and...
clean yourself up and come on out...

52:22.022 --> 52:24.211
whenever you're ready.

53:18.678 --> 53:20.734
Where is Eva?

53:25.285 --> 53:27.557
She's gone, Zac.

53:27.657 --> 53:29.823
Where is she?

53:30.323 --> 53:32.493
I took care of her.

53:33.193 --> 53:35.638
They're both at peace.

53:39.733 --> 53:43.041
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

53:49.326 --> 53:51.263
You didn't.

53:59.386 --> 54:01.675
Go see for yourself.

56:31.671 --> 56:33.876
You're awake.

56:34.574 --> 56:36.830
Are you alright?

56:38.344 --> 56:40.683
We were worried about you.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.236
I'm Jamie.

56:43.883 --> 56:48.416
That's... Frank and Paul over there.

56:48.516 --> 56:51.908
They're good guys. I promise.

56:53.259 --> 56:55.849
You feeling better?

56:59.532 --> 57:04.437
Listen, I... saw that thing on your wrist.

57:04.637 --> 57:06.539
It's okay.

57:06.639 --> 57:09.376
I'm not trying to pry.

57:09.576 --> 57:11.865
We didn't call nobody.

57:12.645 --> 57:15.815
You looked like you were gonna be alright.

57:15.915 --> 57:18.752
We figured you had your reasons.

57:18.852 --> 57:23.209
So I decided to wait and see
if you wanted help or not.

57:25.024 --> 57:26.980
I'm okay.

57:27.994 --> 57:29.762
Alright.

57:29.862 --> 57:33.128
I getcha. I've been there.

57:33.228 --> 57:37.203
We don't have to call nobody
unless you want to.

57:37.303 --> 57:39.559
You just let me know.

57:40.039 --> 57:42.818
Thanks. I appreciate your help.

57:42.918 --> 57:45.232
You're welcome.

57:47.146 --> 57:49.470
Come on over and sit with us.

57:49.570 --> 57:52.039
You don't have to run off.

58:10.637 --> 58:14.340
<i>When you finally start dreamin'</i>

58:14.440 --> 58:17.998
<i>And everyone can tell</i>

58:18.511 --> 58:23.822
<i>I close your eyes, let you drift away</i>

58:25.885 --> 58:29.022
<i>I'll make sure you feel better</i>

58:29.122 --> 58:33.192
<i>With the stillness that you know</i>

58:33.292 --> 58:38.977
<i>From a time when you still
had a million days</i>

58:54.547 --> 58:55.715
He's good, isn't he?

58:55.815 --> 59:00.219
<i>Be true to yourself through and through...</i>

59:00.319 --> 59:04.791
You look just like my daughter does
when the TV'd be on.

59:05.191 --> 59:07.969
Starin' there, frozen.

59:08.494 --> 59:13.833
I'd do little dances in front of the set
and she'd just lean her little body over

59:13.933 --> 59:16.339
till she could see.

59:18.338 --> 59:20.323
Keep love in your heart

59:20.423 --> 59:23.478
Until the day you die

59:31.684 --> 59:33.246
- Get up. Get up.
- What?

59:33.346 --> 59:36.055
- What is that?
- It's the cops. Damn it!

59:36.155 --> 59:40.080
- I was just getting comfortable.
- Shit. Again?

59:40.180 --> 59:42.795
- Assholes.
- You think we should book it?

59:42.895 --> 59:47.153
I sure as hell ain't gonna cut
my ass up climbing out of here.

59:47.634 --> 59:51.163
- Unless this one's done somethin'.
- I didn't do anything.

59:51.263 --> 59:53.606
- You sure?
- I promise I did not do anything.

59:53.706 --> 59:56.263
What's goin' on down here, people?

59:57.226 --> 01:00:00.759
- Y'all are not supposed to be down here.
- Just the four of ya?

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:05.038
Well, yeah. It's just us.

01:00:05.885 --> 01:00:08.308
Alright. Step outside. Come on.

01:00:09.389 --> 01:00:11.345
What the hell?

01:00:30.843 --> 01:00:32.866
<i>Why?</i>

01:00:36.816 --> 01:00:39.188
<i>Why would he blame us?</i>

01:00:44.257 --> 01:00:46.680
<i>What makes him so afraid?</i>

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:57.236
<i>What is it?</i>

01:01:12.118 --> 01:01:15.325
<i>Mom always saw it as a gift.</i>

01:01:16.389 --> 01:01:17.936
<i>She never doubted.</i>

01:01:20.293 --> 01:01:22.528
<i>But he's scared...</i>

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:24.684
<i>and weak.</i>

01:01:38.344 --> 01:01:41.411
<i>I don't know how he can live with himself.</i>

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.931
I wanna make him feel what I feel.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:55.033
Hey, you got a light?

01:02:55.133 --> 01:02:57.023
A what?

01:02:57.123 --> 01:02:58.591
Figured.

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:01.281
Say, you have a lighter I can bum?

01:03:09.836 --> 01:03:14.995
So what's your deal? You just move here?
Run away from home? What?

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:20.580
I don't live with my family anymore.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.881
No shit.

01:03:21.981 --> 01:03:25.352
Me and this dingus just got yanked out
of our parent's house again the other day.

01:03:25.852 --> 01:03:27.420
How come?

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.269
My mom can't stay clean long enough
to have some dumbshit

01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:33.793
walk through our house
tell us if it's livable or not.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:37.408
Which it isn't, but that's not the point.

01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:41.442
My dad threw me out.

01:03:42.868 --> 01:03:45.225
You got any place to stay?

01:03:47.206 --> 01:03:50.643
- No, not really.
- Well, you can hang with me tonight.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:53.246
Then I can see if you can come
to the girl's home with me.

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:57.537
They feed you at least. Just come.

01:04:00.419 --> 01:04:02.241
Alright.

01:04:02.788 --> 01:04:08.235
Okay, well, let me begin
by explaining what I'm here for.

01:04:08.815 --> 01:04:14.556
All the girls here, Eva, have their...
their own stories as how they got here.

01:04:15.001 --> 01:04:18.604
And I would guess that yours
is similar to most of them.

01:04:18.704 --> 01:04:21.074
Now Danny tells me, Eva, that...

01:04:21.174 --> 01:04:24.597
- It's E-va.
- E-va.

01:04:24.697 --> 01:04:27.146
Danny tells me that you
didn't have a place to stay.

01:04:27.246 --> 01:04:30.815
So we're happy to provide that
for you for a little while.

01:04:35.521 --> 01:04:38.025
You know, this is a safe place.

01:04:38.524 --> 01:04:42.795
Everything that you and I talk about
in here it'll stay between you and me.

01:04:42.895 --> 01:04:44.630
Okay.

01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:47.119
Great. Why don't we...

01:04:47.219 --> 01:04:51.103
start with... where you're from.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.494
What about it?

01:04:55.074 --> 01:04:59.232
Well, Danny tells me
that she met you around town.

01:04:59.912 --> 01:05:03.569
Have you always lived here?
Did you grow up somewhere else?

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.872
Somewhere else.

01:05:07.753 --> 01:05:10.300
So how'd you end up here?

01:05:14.861 --> 01:05:17.250
I ran away from home.

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:24.097
That's a very brave thing, Eva.

01:05:24.937 --> 01:05:28.711
New places can be very intimidating
especially on your own.

01:05:31.377 --> 01:05:35.927
Why don't we talk a little bit about
the home that you ran away from?

01:05:36.348 --> 01:05:38.438
Who did you live there with?

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:49.728
My brother and my father

01:05:49.828 --> 01:05:53.059
and... my mother.

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:56.623
Are they still there?

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.422
Eva?

01:06:36.091 --> 01:06:38.381
Are they all still there?

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.384
Yes.

01:06:53.959 --> 01:06:58.151
Gets any colder, we're gonna have
to chop up some more wood.

01:07:03.235 --> 01:07:05.852
You know, you gonna have
to talk to me eventually.

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.962
You can't keep talking
to that horse everyday.

01:07:12.711 --> 01:07:14.981
What is that you want me to say?

01:07:15.081 --> 01:07:19.391
Anything. Whatever you want,
whatever's on your mind.

01:07:19.491 --> 01:07:22.166
Might make things better between us.

01:07:46.879 --> 01:07:49.382
In the end... like,

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.684
they start, like, spending
more and more time together

01:07:51.784 --> 01:07:54.364
but he starts getting weaker and weaker.

01:07:55.821 --> 01:07:57.343
So then, he, like, dies...

01:07:57.443 --> 01:07:59.678
She's doing a lot of things now.

01:07:59.778 --> 01:08:04.096
She likes to dance or play
or she loves singing.

01:08:04.196 --> 01:08:06.453
And she's as...

01:08:09.702 --> 01:08:13.960
Who the hell does she think she is?
Nobody even likes her.

01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:23.236
Well, just 'cause our families' here...
doesn't mean anything.

01:08:27.953 --> 01:08:31.991
Okay, girls. Goodbye hug
and let's line up at the door.

01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:34.180
Hustle up.

01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:38.149
- Come on.
- What the hell?

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:43.636
- Get off of me!
- Danny! Danny!

01:08:43.736 --> 01:08:46.658
- Get off of her. Stop it!
- Just ignore her.

01:08:46.759 --> 01:08:48.991
What the hell do you know?
Your dad threw you out on your ass.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:51.042
- I'm tryin' to help.
- I don't need your help.

01:08:51.143 --> 01:08:54.363
- I don't need anybody's fuckin' help!
- Enough!

01:12:46.712 --> 01:12:50.326
I know you're upset about everything.

01:12:51.049 --> 01:12:52.872
I'm upset, too.

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:04.363
Son, I don't think you got
the full picture.

01:13:13.672 --> 01:13:16.195
Look, when I was your age...

01:13:16.575 --> 01:13:19.495
I struggled to understand this place.

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.884
Walk along that wall.

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:25.137
Wonder...

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.806
what it all meant.

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:33.212
I plagued my dad with questions.

01:13:33.759 --> 01:13:36.295
He told me stories
about your great-grandparents,

01:13:36.395 --> 01:13:40.269
their kin and their friends
who claimed this land.

01:13:40.953 --> 01:13:43.769
Their community had been...

01:13:43.869 --> 01:13:47.318
fractured, had been destroyed by...

01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:52.282
unexplained deaths...

01:13:52.382 --> 01:13:55.334
disappearances, sometimes it's children.

01:13:56.048 --> 01:13:57.616
Tore families apart.

01:13:57.716 --> 01:14:02.426
Having theirs, they... they came here
trying to make a fresh start.

01:14:04.456 --> 01:14:07.415
And now we are the ones that remain.

01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:11.597
Oh, when I was a kid

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.657
those stories filled me full of fear.

01:14:16.101 --> 01:14:18.570
But as time went on, I grew.

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:22.540
Life was... normal, orderly.

01:14:24.109 --> 01:14:28.089
Then your mother and I started
talking about having children.

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:32.214
Those stories came back.

01:14:32.851 --> 01:14:34.907
I was scared.

01:14:36.822 --> 01:14:39.245
And your mother...

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:43.706
she said they were just stories,
they were just folklore.

01:14:45.831 --> 01:14:48.054
And you were born.

01:14:49.468 --> 01:14:53.570
And you were a happy, healthy child.

01:14:55.374 --> 01:14:57.963
We were so happy.

01:15:02.514 --> 01:15:05.037
Few years went by.

01:15:06.818 --> 01:15:09.690
And then along came Eva.

01:15:11.957 --> 01:15:13.746
And...

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:16.949
things started happening.

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:20.386
Your mother fell ill and...

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.491
And we... been struggling ever since.

01:15:37.249 --> 01:15:39.538
It amazes me.

01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:43.751
And after everything
you've done to this family.

01:15:44.723 --> 01:15:47.431
That you can sit in here...

01:15:47.531 --> 01:15:49.995
and talk, and talk...

01:15:50.095 --> 01:15:55.033
Zac, I'm telling you the truth.
I'm not saying I'm without fault here.

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:57.436
I'm not. But I need you to understand.

01:15:57.536 --> 01:16:00.222
Understand how delusional you are?

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:02.875
Not to... sit down. Sit down!

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.545
- You want me to understand for you killing Eva!
- Zac, stop!

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:08.330
I need you to calm down. Listen to me.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:12.117
- I need you to understand something.
- I will never forgive you for killin' Eva.

01:16:12.217 --> 01:16:14.953
I need you to understand who I think
you are and what you're capable of.

01:16:15.053 --> 01:16:18.457
- Let go of me.
- Zac, Zac, what are you doing?

01:16:18.557 --> 01:16:21.681
Zac, no! What are you doing?

01:16:45.884 --> 01:16:48.040
I'm sorry, son.

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:46.078
I always wondered
what it would be like without him.

01:20:49.728 --> 01:20:53.175
Part of me thought it would feel
kinda good, you know?

01:21:03.708 --> 01:21:06.918
I keep thinking I'm gonna see you wave.

01:21:09.381 --> 01:21:11.603
When I wake up...

01:21:13.451 --> 01:21:15.741
when I turn around...

01:21:18.289 --> 01:21:20.612
You and Mom.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:25.726
Even Dad, if you believe that.

01:21:30.602 --> 01:21:33.308
But I know that isn't gonna happen.

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:38.630
I'm just gonna have to...

01:21:39.344 --> 01:21:41.782
learn to live with that.

01:23:47.705 --> 01:23:49.528
Zac!

01:23:49.774 --> 01:23:51.563
Eva?

01:24:28.346 --> 01:24:30.268
Goodbye, Mom.

01:24:32.083 --> 01:24:34.005
Thank you.

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:05.053
Hey.

01:25:06.217 --> 01:25:08.507
I have an idea.

01:25:10.655 --> 01:25:15.789
<i>I'm the king of my own land</i>

01:25:20.398 --> 01:25:23.702
<i>Facing tempests of dust</i>

01:25:23.802 --> 01:25:28.955
<i>I'll fight until the end</i>

01:25:32.610 --> 01:25:35.513
<i>Creatures of my dreams raise up</i>

01:25:35.613 --> 01:25:39.144
<i>And dance with me</i>

01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:49.948
<i>Now and forever</i>

01:25:50.295 --> 01:25:52.455
<i>I'm your king</i>
