00:03.169 --> 00:05.296
KELLY:
<i>Good morning.</i>

00:05.380 --> 00:08.675
{\an4}Mm.
Hey, did Noah spend the night
here again last night?

00:08.758 --> 00:11.594
{\an4}Mm-hmm.
Oh, that makes...
three times in a row.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.012
Really?
I wasn't keeping track.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.431
Well, neither have I.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.891
{\an3}I just know that he's moving
off the boat this week.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.935
And I bet you're wondering
if he's moving in here.

00:19.018 --> 00:19.936
No.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.980
Yeah, I was a little curious.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.231
{\an1}So am I.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.858
{\an3}You don't know
where he's moving?

00:24.941 --> 00:26.609
Moving?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.611
I don't even know
what he's feeling.

00:28.695 --> 00:29.904
How are <i> you</i> feeling?

00:29.988 --> 00:32.573
I just... I feel like

00:32.656 --> 00:35.785
I really want to take care
of him, you know?

00:35.869 --> 00:38.329
Ding-dong! Hey, Donna,
you have those revisions?

00:38.413 --> 00:40.290
(gasps)
Revisions, deadline, oh!

00:40.373 --> 00:41.958
Hi.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.001
{\an1}DONNA:
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.502
Carrie Knox, Kelly Taylor.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.963
{\an4}Kelly's my roommate,
and Carrie I hired
to help me with

00:47.046 --> 00:47.922
{\an3}my sketch revisions.
Nice to meet you.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.299
Nice meeting you.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.300
(sighs)

00:50.383 --> 00:52.302
You know, why they need
revisions is a mystery.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.554
I mean, your originals
are very rad.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.972
God, if I had
your talent...

00:56.055 --> 00:58.475
It would be a huge step
backwards, but nice try.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.810
Okay, I got 'em.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.313
Great, so then I have
the sketches in order,

01:03.396 --> 01:04.980
plus copy, plus
cost breakdown.

01:05.063 --> 01:05.815
Great. Good work.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.525
This could be
my big breakthrough.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.486
So, are you gonna take
the 10 or Venice?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.322
{\an4}I'll make my deadline;
you just remember
to make yours.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.866
{\an6}(sighs)
Lunch with Jankowski
should seal the deal.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.826
{\an3}I'm gone.
Bye.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.286
Good morning,
good morning.

01:18.369 --> 01:19.829
{\an1}Coffee, anyone?
Ah. Yes.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.080
Thank you.
Okay.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.000
No, thank you, I already have
some-- but thank you for that

01:24.083 --> 01:26.002
{\an6}job recommendation.
Oh, that means
you got my message.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.337
I wouldn't let
this one get away.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.840
{\an6}Actually, I'm very
comfortable being
undirected right now.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.176
Okay.

01:33.259 --> 01:33.843
All set?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.845
Let's go.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.806
{\an3}Hey, excuse me.
Good morning.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.558
{\an5}Where you going?
Pasadena, to get
my dad's stuff.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.019
{\an3}Okay, um, I'll
give you a ride.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.020
No, it's covered.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.230
{\an3}I want to.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.898
I know, and I appreciate it.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.358
I'm gonna go with Brandon.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.402
Sure.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.114
{\an1}Ready?
Yeah.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.535
What?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.373
I want him to live with me.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.833
Then tell him.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.252
{\an3}Uh-uh.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.878
{\an3}Brandon, you forgot
your ph...

02:09.963 --> 02:12.090
phone.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.430
{\an1}I want you to write
the obituary.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.599
{\an3}Whoa, whoa, whoa, you
got the wrong guy, buddy.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.353
{\an5}My plate's full as it is.
All the other papers
want to write is:

02:25.436 --> 02:26.604
{\an1}Daniel Hunter,
businessman, legend.

02:26.688 --> 02:27.856
And this is a <i> bad</i> thing?

02:27.939 --> 02:31.442
When honoring a man, it usually
involves telling the truth.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.777
{\an1}What, your father
<i>wasn't</i> a legend?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.737
You gonna write
the piece or not?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.407
Help you?
Yeah, I'm Daniel Hunter's son.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.410
I'm here to get his things.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.708
Plastic bag.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.501
How suitably transparent.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.881
You're giving me his gun?

02:52.964 --> 02:53.923
This some kind
of sick joke?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.384
My father blew his brains out
with that thing.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.886
{\an3}I understand your
suffering, sir,

02:57.969 --> 02:59.888
{\an3}but this is
not a warehouse.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.057
{\an5}So what am I gonna do,
hang it on my wall?
Hey, come on, let's go.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.685
I'm asking you a question!
Come on, let's go.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.566
It's okay. Let's go.

<i>Honestly, Valerie,</i>

05:05.013 --> 05:06.055
{\an3}these eggs Benedict
were delish.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.559
And coming off last night's
dinner at Chez Sabine.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.895
And the theater tickets
and loaning us your car.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.940
{\an4}These last few days,
you've really made
me feel welcome.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.900
{\an6}Good.
Ah, sorry to
interrupt.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.693
{\an3}I got everything
I needed.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.236
{\an1}Oh, David's got
this new radio gig

05:20.319 --> 05:22.030
in a few days--
it's for KVIB--

05:22.113 --> 05:24.365
{\an1}and if he does really well,
he gets a weekly slot.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.075
{\an3}Operative word
being "if."

05:26.159 --> 05:27.243
I'm sure I'll bomb.

05:27.326 --> 05:28.911
{\an1}ABBY:
Oh, you'll be great.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.247
{\an5}Listen, you sit;
we'll clear the table.
Yeah.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.127
I really don't
get you, Val.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.046
One minute you plan
to crush your mother

05:38.129 --> 05:39.922
{\an3}by admitting you killed
your father, and...

05:40.006 --> 05:42.091
now it's all hugs
and eggs Benedict?

05:42.175 --> 05:42.967
She's my mother, David.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.094
{\an1}Do you really think
I was gonna hurt her?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.429
Yeah.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.514
But I'm glad you didn't.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.058
Bye.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.934
Bye.

05:53.811 --> 05:55.772
(clearing throat loudly)

05:55.855 --> 05:57.440
{\an1}(laughs):
Sorry.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.276
Have three legs on the floor
at all times, I have no problem.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.861
Go on, tell her.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.908
{\an3}We've decided
to get married in Vegas.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.286
All right, that's it,
both you guys are grounded.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.454
(both laugh)

06:11.537 --> 06:12.622
Day after tomorrow.

06:12.705 --> 06:13.790
But our flight

06:13.873 --> 06:14.999
leaves tonight at 10:00--

06:15.083 --> 06:16.334
and I want you to be

06:16.417 --> 06:17.627
my maid of honor.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.961
Oh, Mom, I'd love to.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.172
Oh, honey. Oh.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.469
{\an3}What, no hug for
your stepdaughter?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.221
Aw, well.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.057
(both laugh)

06:35.603 --> 06:37.814
STEVE:
You forgot your books.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.649
Mm.

06:39.732 --> 06:43.027
{\an3}Oh, so this is
the new buggy, huh?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.321
Sixty... what? '65?

06:45.404 --> 06:46.823
'65 Mustang.

06:46.906 --> 06:47.907
Very cherry.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.160
{\an6}If you like,
I'd consider an
outside investor.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.496
{\an1}Sophie, are you
propositioning me?

06:53.579 --> 06:54.789
{\an3}Absolutely.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.666
Is there a risk?

06:56.749 --> 06:58.709
It's a vintage car--
bound to appreciate.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.836
Well, I don't know.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.379
{\an3}With you at the
library every night,

07:01.462 --> 07:04.006
I'm not sure I can keep
an eye on my investment.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.509
Hey, speaking of nights,

07:06.592 --> 07:08.970
{\an5}you can't keep sleeping
on the couch.
Well, I'm not

07:09.053 --> 07:10.221
gonna let you sleep there.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.848
No, I wasn't planning on it.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.224
The bed's big enough for two.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.559
The bed.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.018
Mm-hmm.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.854
You, me...

07:17.937 --> 07:20.064
...imaginary line
down the middle.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.066
We can deal, right?

07:22.150 --> 07:22.984
Yeah, sure.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.193
An imaginary line.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.862
{\an3}No problem.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.029
Anyway, Donna's having a party

07:27.113 --> 07:27.989
tomorrow night,
for her parents' 25th.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.032
I thought maybe
you'd like to go with me.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.868
Sure. I'd love to.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.035
{\an1}Gonna be late
for class.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.537
See you later.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.622
(starts engine)

07:39.083 --> 07:42.211
Hey! You forgot your books!

07:42.962 --> 07:46.257
Yes, yes,
for the third time, yes.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.593
{\an5}Really?
You know,
you and Carrie

07:48.676 --> 07:51.220
{\an1}have this nice
good cop/bad cop thing going.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.638
Me and Carrie?

07:52.722 --> 07:55.433
{\an1}Oh, you know-- she comes in
all poise and confidence,

07:55.516 --> 07:58.895
{\an5}and then you show up
at lunch with the
"aw, shucks" routine.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.063
{\an5}It's very effective.
(nervous chuckle):
Right.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.192
{\an5}So what's our game plan?
Well, the timing
couldn't be more perfect.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.069
{\an1}By the way, did I tell you
how impressed I was

08:07.153 --> 08:08.112
{\an1}with Carrie's
presentation this morning?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.572
Carrie's presentation?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.574
{\an1}Yeah, your partner
did an excellent job.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.576
Partner? I don't
have a partner.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.994
(laughs)

08:15.077 --> 08:17.413
{\an1}You know, truth be told,
I was thrown at first myself.

08:17.496 --> 08:19.749
{\an1}But after Carrie
explained the changes,

08:19.832 --> 08:21.918
your working process--
she's very proficient.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.587
{\an5}I'm sorry, there's
been some...
Oh, and the home office

08:24.670 --> 08:26.631
in Chicago, they can't
wait to see your stuff.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.132
{\an1}I got 'em chomping
at the bit.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.593
Right, so there's a
lot riding on this.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.761
{\an1}A lot?

08:31.844 --> 08:32.761
Donna, i-if this line

08:32.845 --> 08:36.432
{\an1}gets the go-ahead,
you make <i> Women's Wear Daily,</i>

08:36.515 --> 08:37.600
and I get upped

08:37.683 --> 08:39.268
{\an1}to West Coast Manager,
I.G. Nesbitt

08:39.352 --> 08:40.937
{\an1}Department Stores of America--
and believe me,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.313
{\an1}I am not the type
who forgets his friends.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.484
Oops. I got to be
in Century City.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.777
Thanks for meeting me halfway.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.153
{\an3}Okay.
All right.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.955
{\an1}How'd it go
at the police station?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.957
How do you think?
I got my dad's gun.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.292
{\an3}Man, it's beautiful,
isn't it?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.086
{\an1}Noah, maybe you
should put that away.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.921
{\an3}You ever see one of
these suckers go off?

09:07.004 --> 09:08.297
Noah...
Check it out.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.466
(gunshot booms)
Are you nuts?!

09:10.549 --> 09:12.510
{\an1}I can't believe
you just did that.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.679
{\an3}You finally dropped the
Florence Nightingale routine.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.681
Oh, forgive me for
worrying about you.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.307
Ever wonder
where a bullet lands

09:18.391 --> 09:20.935
{\an3}when it's shot in the air?
Fine, keep up

09:21.018 --> 09:22.019
this tough-guy act--
sooner or later,

09:22.103 --> 09:23.479
it's gonna catch up with you.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.022
You better go back inside.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.649
{\an3}And when
that happens,

09:26.732 --> 09:29.110
you're gonna need
someone to talk to. Noah?

09:30.361 --> 09:32.363
(frustrated sigh)

09:34.073 --> 09:37.702
(rock music blaring)

09:37.785 --> 09:40.371
(rock continues)

09:43.791 --> 09:45.167
Sophie!

09:48.045 --> 09:49.213
(horn honks)

09:49.297 --> 09:51.507
BLYTHE HUNTER:
<i>As a young man,</i>

09:51.591 --> 09:55.052
Daniel resisted going
into the family business.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.680
He wanted to be an artist.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.515
A sculptor.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.559
Did he find success?

10:01.642 --> 10:04.020
A show in New York, once.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.564
The critics tore it to shreds.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.065
And after that?

10:08.149 --> 10:09.442
Hunter Oil became his life.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.986
The pictures-- um...

10:12.069 --> 10:13.946
I couldn't help but notice

10:14.030 --> 10:16.866
{\an5}your husband's not smiling
in any of them.
Look,

10:16.949 --> 10:21.662
my husband lived and worked
for a company he loathed

10:21.746 --> 10:23.247
24 hours a day.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.874
And for what?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.208
Money?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.878
He couldn't have cared less.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.921
For his family?

10:31.005 --> 10:32.882
Work took him away from us.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.050
So why, then?

10:34.133 --> 10:37.261
Because he'd
become numb.

10:37.345 --> 10:41.557
And when the company collapsed,
like so much worthless paper,

10:41.640 --> 10:43.184
he did, too.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.063
{\an1}Choices.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.522
Daniel Hunter...

10:48.606 --> 10:51.025
hoped to be an artist.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.112
Print that.

11:05.331 --> 11:09.543
{\an1}Hey.
Hey.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.754
{\an3}Uh, you know that stuff
you've been pounding

11:11.837 --> 11:14.131
{\an3}into my head
the past few nights?

11:14.215 --> 11:15.966
New music titles
for your radio show?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.635
Yeah, well, I've,

11:17.718 --> 11:19.428
{\an3}I've enjoyed
the give and take.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.140
And you were right
and I was wrong.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.017
Actually,

11:25.101 --> 11:28.479
{\an1}I rethought why you
and I were out of sync.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.941
And here.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.317
Really?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.489
You did this for me?

11:38.572 --> 11:39.824
Mm-hmm.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.618
See, it's not so much
the tunes that were off,

11:42.701 --> 11:43.953
it was just, um,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.538
the way that they
meet each other, you know?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.050
{\an3}Really?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.724
(footsteps approaching)

12:07.893 --> 12:10.479
Any other bags?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.983
{\an1}Just that one-- but first,
um, do you mind?

12:14.066 --> 12:16.527
(chuckling nervously)

12:16.610 --> 12:19.071
What?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.782
{\an3}Oh, nothing, well,
it's just, in a way,

12:21.866 --> 12:24.160
I'm gonna be your father.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.495
Well, my father used to
zip me up all the time.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.914
{\an1}Actually, we were very
affectionate, so...

12:28.998 --> 12:31.876
Oh, well, that's nice.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.502
Come on, please!

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
{\an1}I'm not gonna bite,
I promise.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.554
(zipping)

12:43.637 --> 12:46.307
Thank you.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.392
(clears throat)

12:55.107 --> 12:57.234
Oh, so she returns,

12:57.318 --> 12:58.652
keys in hand, to a scene

12:58.736 --> 13:00.404
of happier, friskier times.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.864
I came to return
Brandon's phone.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.073
Is he here?

13:03.157 --> 13:03.908
Ooh, and a positive attitude.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.034
That's very smart.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.870
Yeah, well, Abby's
waiting in the car.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.706
{\an1}Whenever you're ready.
Okay.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.709
You going on a trip or you
making a clean getaway?

13:13.792 --> 13:14.877
Well, if you must know,

13:14.960 --> 13:16.545
um, my mother's gonna marry
that moron in Las Vegas.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.380
{\an1}Of course, one
could always hope

13:18.464 --> 13:20.841
that there'll be a last-minute
bust-up, like you and Brandon.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.222
These are some of my things.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.057
Who stuffed them in here?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.851
{\an3}Well, I don't know,
maybe Brandon?

13:30.935 --> 13:33.854
(phone ringing)

13:33.938 --> 13:35.231
{\an1}Hello, whoever it is,
call back later.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.899
Who's this?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.359
Excuse me, who's this?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.069
Just tell him
Susie needs to know

13:40.152 --> 13:41.987
if we're on for tonight, okay?

13:42.071 --> 13:43.489
Ah, okay, Susie.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.414
I can't believe he just...
threw my things in a box.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.125
Well, I hate to break up
this bonding moment

13:55.209 --> 13:56.752
but I have a plane to catch.

13:56.835 --> 13:59.046
Take me with you.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.090
Yeah, that's happening.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.424
(sighing)

14:02.508 --> 14:04.051
All right,

14:04.134 --> 14:05.636
but this doesn't mean
we're friends.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.972
Oh, God, no.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.056
Good.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.433
Ugh.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.435
NOAH:
<i>It's a lie.</i>

14:13.519 --> 14:15.271
{\an4}My father never
had an unconventional
bone in his body.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.106
{\an3}It's a fact, about 23, he
wanted to be an artist.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.315
{\an3}He failed.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.068
Such a weird choice-- .357.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.778
I'd have used a shotgun.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.698
You're the one
who wanted the truth.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.408
The problem is a guy wants
to blow his brains out...

14:27.491 --> 14:29.118
{\an4}(sighing)
can't reach his hands
to the trigger.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.787
I read Hemingway
used his big toe.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.289
Look, you can't understand
the pressures he was under.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.291
{\an3}His pride,

14:35.374 --> 14:38.586
his sense of self-worth,
obligations to his family,

14:38.669 --> 14:39.670
his shareholders.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.756
The guy wanted to be
a sculptor and he gave it up.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.134
Why the mouth, though?

14:45.217 --> 14:47.303
And why not take it
right through the heart?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.304
Or right here,

14:48.387 --> 14:49.805
underneath his chin?

14:49.888 --> 14:50.764
You're not listening to me.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.101
{\an3}Your father, he made
the wrong life choice.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.312
He was miserable.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.188
Dear old Dad.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.649
Selfish to the very end.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.651
I'm sure he loved you very much.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.153
You sure about that?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.654
{\an1}Huh?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.823
He had a hell of a way
of showing it, man.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.879
So, it's organic chem today.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.798
{\an1}No coffee stops?
Side trips?

15:24.882 --> 15:27.343
Nope, today's organic day.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.970
{\an1}Uh, by the way, you left
your books here yesterday.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.598
For organic.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.474
Weren't we supposed to be

15:33.557 --> 15:35.851
sharing the bed
last night, remember?

15:35.934 --> 15:37.019
{\an1}Platonic?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.229
Well, I got home
late last night.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.522
I didn't want to bother you.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.691
Hmm. Heavy date?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.735
You know a Phyllis Neems?

15:44.818 --> 15:46.862
{\an3}Didn't she star in Deadly
Giveaway? Yeah.

15:46.945 --> 15:47.696
Yeah, that's her.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.864
Anyway, we went to this

15:48.947 --> 15:50.866
{\an3}coffee house on Melrose,
just off Harper.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.701
David turned me on to it.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.911
{\an3}It's called The Equator--
do you know it?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.245
No.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.332
Anyway, Phyllis
and I were talking

15:58.415 --> 16:00.376
{\an3}and, well, one thing
led to another

16:00.459 --> 16:02.461
{\an3}and I just happened to
mention Donna's party and...

16:02.544 --> 16:03.879
The Equator.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.757
{\an1}Isn't that the one
with brick in the front?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.384
{\an1}I just remembered,
I've been there.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.678
{\an1}I ran into David there.
You did?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.054
{\an1}Yeah, just yesterday.
It was a total coincidence.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.557
I thought you were
at organic chemistry.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.433
No, microbiology
in the afternoon.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.060
In the morning,
I was hunting for a job

16:18.143 --> 16:19.228
so I could pay you some rent.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.814
(chuckles)
Listen, Sophie,

16:21.897 --> 16:24.233
{\an3}about Phyllis, if you want,
I can blow her off.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.859
Like you just did to me?

16:25.943 --> 16:27.069
No.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.446
{\an1}I'll sleep
on the couch tonight.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.408
Besides, movie star.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.742
You might need the bedroom.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.422
{\an1}CROUPIER:
Ball's rollin' and 14!

16:46.505 --> 16:47.631
{\an1}Red 14!

16:47.715 --> 16:50.217
Loser wins again.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.678
Okay, let's see.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.388
The name "Susie"
has got five letters in it.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.473
Let's play, ah,

16:56.557 --> 16:57.558
seven for "cheater."

16:57.641 --> 16:59.601
This is how Kelly Taylor
moves on?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.478
How many letters in "pathetic"?

17:01.562 --> 17:02.771
Same as in "go to hell."

17:02.855 --> 17:04.940
{\an3}That puts eight
in play.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.942
{\an3}VALERIE:
Oh, here they come.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.234
All kissy-face.

17:08.318 --> 17:10.279
It's so nauseating.

17:10.362 --> 17:13.574
Your mom lost 200
at the quarter slots!

17:13.656 --> 17:14.782
Well, you know
what they say.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.577
Lucky in love.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.953
{\an1}That I am.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.914
{\an1}And I've also been up
all night and I'm beat.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.624
Blushing brides
need eight hours sleep.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.460
It's a rule or something.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.961
Why don't you go on?

17:26.044 --> 17:27.337
I'll chaperone Carl.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.298
No, no, no, I'll go with you.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.633
{\an1}No, no,
don't be silly.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.677
Stay, win my money back.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.099
You heard the lady.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.976
{\an3}Come on.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.479
This looks like a good one.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.772
(slot machine chimes)

17:44.855 --> 17:47.316
{\an3}Oh, sometimes
they're a bit sticky.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.444
(slot machine chimes
three times)

17:50.527 --> 17:53.322
(bells ringing,
coins clattering)

17:53.405 --> 17:56.533
{\an6}(laughing)
Well, I guess your luck's
about to change.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.453
I put everything on 12.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.163
Yeah, why?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.499
Because that's how many seconds

18:03.582 --> 18:05.501
it took for me
to fall in love with you.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.961
Oh, congratulations.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.506
{\an1}That's the worst pickup line
I've ever heard.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.841
{\an3}CROUPIER:
36 Red. 36.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.719
{\an1}Wait a second,
I thought you bet 12.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.846
{\an3}12 numbers.
I hedged my bet.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.264
You might be married.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.558
I'm not.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.269
I'm Henry.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.314
I'm Kelly.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.149
DONNA:
<i>So anyway, I finally</i>

18:29.233 --> 18:30.400
get a chance to break out
on a national scale.

18:30.484 --> 18:34.071
I called Carrie like ten times
and she wouldn't call me back.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.656
What should I label this?

18:35.739 --> 18:37.032
Kitchen, living room?

18:37.115 --> 18:38.200
Doesn't matter.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.702
{\an3}Well, actually, it does
'cause if we label it kitchen

18:40.786 --> 18:42.204
{\an3}and it ends up
in the bathroom...

18:42.287 --> 18:43.705
I said it doesn't matter.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.710
What?!

18:48.794 --> 18:50.796
Just worried, okay?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.383
Nobody asked you to.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.551
I want to, okay?

18:55.634 --> 18:59.513
Look, I think about him every
night since he died, okay?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.349
{\an1}Sometimes five hours
a night.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.560
That's five hours
more than he ever gave me.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.895
Don't you get it?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.857
{\an1}Huh?
My father was a selfish man.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.900
He never loved me.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.694
{\an1}(sighing)

19:13.777 --> 19:15.612
I'm staying in my office.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.082
BRANDON:
<i>Hey, Janet,</i>

19:27.165 --> 19:29.585
{\an1}any chance that Daniel Hunter
obit can go on three?

19:29.668 --> 19:30.752
Uh, it doesn't fit.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.547
Doesn't fit?
Why not doesn't fit?

19:33.630 --> 19:34.590
{\an1}Because I pared down
the club piece

19:34.673 --> 19:36.341
{\an1}with the Angel Bra ad
and they fit.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.093
Put Angel Bra on six.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.595
We do better sales
with it on three.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.596
Come on, guys.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.388
Angel Bra?

19:41.471 --> 19:43.599
{\an1}I have a dead pillar
of the community

19:43.682 --> 19:45.601
who hated his life.
That's news.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.768
Yeah, but if you ask me,
I think it's a stretch

19:46.852 --> 19:48.437
we're doing an obituary
to begin with.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.354
She's right.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.564
Our readers want

19:50.647 --> 19:52.566
movie information, music news.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.775
I know what our

19:53.859 --> 19:54.943
readers want, Steve.

19:55.027 --> 19:55.944
Why not give them
what they need?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.404
To reflect on the life

19:57.487 --> 19:59.948
and times of some dead rich guy?

20:00.032 --> 20:04.578
Steve, um, Daniel Hunter
was, uh, a blank.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.789
{\an1}He was a...
a missed opportunity.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.167
But he left us
with a legacy.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.252
Not about Angel Bra sales
but about the fact

20:12.336 --> 20:15.631
that we need to take control
of our lives.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.592
{\an1}To do something
meaningful.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.804
To not... settle

20:22.888 --> 20:24.973
for average.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.810
Nothing?

20:35.734 --> 20:37.444
All righty.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.032
{\an1}CARL:
All right, see the shoes?

20:42.115 --> 20:44.326
Dead giveaway.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.995
{\an1}Brown oxfords and
a cheap navy blue suit.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.539
Sorry, no class.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.625
So, what do you think?

20:51.708 --> 20:52.668
Guy on the make?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.461
Or a cop walking his beat.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.837
Hmm.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.506
All right, 10:00.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.507
{\an1}Playing craps,
junior miss

20:58.590 --> 20:59.675
in gray and black.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.469
{\an1}VALERIE:
Ooh, okay, no wedding band.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.304
Chic suit but, uh...

21:04.388 --> 21:05.847
Ooh, she's got scuffed shoes.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.016
{\an1}Hmm, I take
she's a player.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.686
What she wants, she gets.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.896
Huh, you're so sure.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.692
Trust me, I would know.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.319
(woman squealing)

21:19.403 --> 21:21.071
You can't still be winning.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.031
Yep, we're up
over $1,000.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.825
"We." How cozy.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.243
{\an1}CARL:
Well, I'm gonna go to bed.

21:26.326 --> 21:27.869
{\an3}I'll, uh, see you
in the morning.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.913
Oh, by the way,

21:29.997 --> 21:32.040
she doesn't blow on dice.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.921
(elevator bell dings)

21:38.005 --> 21:40.882
(Valerie clears throat)

21:40.966 --> 21:42.217
Did you see the clasp?

21:42.300 --> 21:43.301
See, that's new.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.636
Probably tonight's gift.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.888
{\an3}And the tooth thing--
that's, um,

21:46.972 --> 21:48.348
{\an3}that's to make sure
they're real.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.558
It's a test.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.560
Every pearl has
to have a bump.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.811
So she doesn't love him.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.730
Not yet, anyway.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.982
(both chuckle)

21:57.065 --> 21:58.233
So, here we are.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.446
Listen, if you're not
tired yet...

22:02.529 --> 22:05.115
I-I'm not, really, but, uh...

22:05.198 --> 22:07.451
You know, they don't put clocks
in hotel rooms here.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.493
{\an3}They, uh...

22:08.577 --> 22:10.537
they don't want anybody
to know what time it is.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.540
They want them to feel that it's
always a good time to gamble.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.377
Do you think it's a
good time to gamble?

22:24.509 --> 22:25.844
Stop. Stop.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.891
I thought I heard
familiar voices.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.100
{\an1}(chuckles)
Mmm...

22:32.184 --> 22:33.643
I missed you.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.271
{\an1}Did you take
good care of him?

22:36.354 --> 22:38.815
{\an3}The best.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.624
{\an3}Would've been my parents'
25th anniversary next month.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.751
Mom tell you that?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.753
No. No, she didn't.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.130
Hey, you might want to slow down
a little bit there, pal.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.590
It's going to be a long night.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.343
{\an3}What, are you a
friend of Bill W.'s?

23:06.426 --> 23:07.928
That's funny.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.472
{\an3}Great.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.977
{\an3}STEVE:
Mr. Walsh.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.479
My fellow traveler.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.731
{\an3}You know what? Whatever he's
having, bring me a double.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.650
{\an1}No Sophie?
No imaginary starlet?

23:21.733 --> 23:24.444
Your plan is working
to perfection so far.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.654
STEVE:
At least she's not with David.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.989
{\an5}BRANDON:
Maybe your imaginary friend
got to him first.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.871
{\an1}Silver.
Sanders.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.666
{\an1}For a second, I thought
she'd show up here with you.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.709
Who?
Sophie.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.545
You thought that because...?

23:41.628 --> 23:43.547
I saw you together
at the coffee shop.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.716
{\an1}I thought
we were friends, David.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.557
Brandon!

23:53.640 --> 23:55.225
I'm being summoned
to the podium,

23:55.308 --> 23:57.310
but I want you to meet
a friend of mine. Lou Jessup.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.020
Know the name and the work.
<i>New York Chronicle,</i> right?

23:59.104 --> 24:00.564
Brandon Walsh.
Right.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.524
Doc Martin says
you're a writer.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.818
{\an1}On occasion, when I haven't
had too much scotch.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.695
(laughs)
For the <i> Beverly Beat.</i>

24:06.778 --> 24:08.321
Oh,<i> that</i> Brandon Walsh.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.365
Oh, well, now
it all fits.

24:10.448 --> 24:13.160
{\an3}Yes, I, uh, I read
it often.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.661
{\an1}Really?

24:14.744 --> 24:16.204
{\an1}"Fire Marshal Bob
saves Fluffy the cat."

24:16.288 --> 24:17.706
You read that?

24:17.789 --> 24:18.707
Why, something
wrong with it?

24:18.790 --> 24:20.709
Now, let me get
this straight.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.502
{\an1}When Fluffy's owner
donned her birthday suit

24:22.586 --> 24:24.546
{\an1}instead of her usual
bourbon-stained nightie

24:24.629 --> 24:26.381
{\an1}to greet those big,
handsome firemen,

24:26.464 --> 24:28.884
{\an1}that was cutting-edge
journalism to you?

24:28.967 --> 24:31.011
Right.

24:33.805 --> 24:34.389
(tapping glass)

24:34.472 --> 24:35.348
{\an3}Excuse me.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.516
First of all,

24:36.600 --> 24:38.226
{\an1}I would like to thank
all of you

24:38.310 --> 24:41.104
{\an1}for coming to my parents'
25th anniversary party.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.189
Whoo!

24:43.481 --> 24:46.902
And now I know most of you are
ready to roast the daring duo.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.361
(Donna laughs)

24:49.362 --> 24:50.697
Thank you, Donna.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.449
As you know,
Felice and I met...

24:52.532 --> 24:54.075
{\an4}Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.
What?

24:54.159 --> 24:56.077
A toast

24:56.161 --> 24:57.412
to the happy couple.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.288
{\an3}Come on.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.539
Come on, everybody.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.707
Cheers.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.587
Hickory, dickory, duck.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.504
Oh, hey, come on.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.173
I'm just kidding.
I'm-I'm kidding around.

25:09.132 --> 25:11.593
{\an3}Seriously, though,
Felicia...

25:12.677 --> 25:14.054
(laughing):
...and whoever you are,

25:14.137 --> 25:15.764
{\an6}it's...
Thank you,
Mr. Hunter.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.098
{\an1}Thank you.
I'm kidding.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.559
When Donna and
I get married,

25:19.643 --> 25:20.602
we're gonna have,

25:20.685 --> 25:23.521
{\an3}I don't know,
like, 150 kids.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.940
(Noah snickers)

25:25.023 --> 25:28.777
And half you geezers
won't even be there,

25:28.860 --> 25:30.779
'cause you'll be dead.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.322
{\an5}All right, that's
it, Noah.
(Noah laughing)

25:32.405 --> 25:33.448
{\an3}Come on,
I want you out!

25:33.531 --> 25:34.658
{\an3}Come on, out.
(laughing): Wait.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.787
To the Martians.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.001
(laughing):
Martians.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.797
(Noah laughing)

25:59.891 --> 26:00.809
<i>Big Noah</i>

26:00.892 --> 26:01.977
the toast master.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.311
I can't remember.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.313
Was it bad?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.524
Well, let's see,
on a scale of one to 50,

26:07.607 --> 26:10.277
50 being the worst, I'd say
you were about a hundred.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.195
{\an1}You called them
Martians.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.281
Great, I'm in hell.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.657
You know what, man?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.826
Take a dozen aspirin,
drink a gallon

26:17.909 --> 26:19.828
{\an1}of coffee
and you should be fine.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.705
Thanks.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.751
Oh, boy.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.840
Hey.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.049
Hey.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.051
{\an1}Got the message.
Yep.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.177
{\an3}Getting ready for
the broadcast?

26:36.261 --> 26:37.846
{\an1}Look, I'm gonna
get right to the point.

26:37.929 --> 26:41.182
{\an1}Um... whatever it is
we started,

26:41.266 --> 26:43.310
it stops as of right now.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.065
What was it we started?

26:52.944 --> 26:54.904
Look, Steve's a friend of mine.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.948
{\an1}I really

26:57.032 --> 26:58.700
don't want to see him get hurt.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.035
You got your car.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.871
{\an1}I'm sure you can find
a place to crash.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.372
{\an1}Start a fight,
whatever.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.624
Stop leading him on, okay?

27:09.627 --> 27:11.671
{\an5}I see you took
my suggestion.
Sophie.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.301
{\an5}I just thought
maybe we...
You should go.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.314
You really don't want me.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.907
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

27:38.990 --> 27:39.866
but it's been an hour.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.910
{\an3}Can you try again?
Really, Mr. Jankowski

27:41.993 --> 27:43.244
is still in conference.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.537
If you care to wait.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.914
Thanks.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.999
(phone rings)

27:50.502 --> 27:53.088
{\an1}You took credit for work
you didn't do.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.256
{\an3}Would you call
security, please.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.967
{\an1}Carrie, you owe me
an explanation.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.720
All right. Look.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.765
{\an1}Jankowski had me explain
the designs and I did.

28:03.848 --> 28:05.016
He hired me in-house.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.309
End of story.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.937
They were my designs.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.271
Your word against mine.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.273
Look, you stole my chance.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.984
They hired you in-house
because you're cheaper

28:15.068 --> 28:17.570
{\an3}to do work you're not
capable of doing.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.781
When they find that out,
you're done.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.116
Oh, but you said
I was better than you.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.077
I lied.

28:29.165 --> 28:31.918
{\an3}I said I wanted it
on page three.

28:32.001 --> 28:32.710
It's going on page six.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.462
Steve, he was our
friend's father.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.839
Noah hated him.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.465
He was a bad guy.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.301
{\an3}Who lived a lie and
realized it too late.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.511
He spat on his
dream, Steve,

28:41.594 --> 28:42.971
{\an3}and he ended
up with nothing.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.014
{\an5}Yeah, yeah.
That's his legacy,
Steve.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.142
Nothing.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.645
{\an3}(sighs)

28:50.728 --> 28:52.480
Of course my legacy is...

28:52.564 --> 28:53.690
Fluffy and Angel Bras.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.483
{\an3}Oh,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.485
this is about the <i> New York</i>
<i>Chronicle</i> guy, isn't it?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.279
About wanting something
you can't have.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.948
We all want what we can't have,
Steve.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.159
That's the essence of wanting.
Yeah.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.494
But we're not all bitter
about it.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.496
{\an3}I guess that's
the downside

29:08.580 --> 29:09.998
{\an1}of feeling entitled, huh?
Like you

29:10.081 --> 29:11.499
don't feel entitled to Sophie.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.709
Oh, low blow, Bran.

29:12.792 --> 29:13.585
Like it doesn't hurt

29:13.668 --> 29:16.004
you so much that
she's jonesing for David

29:16.087 --> 29:18.047
that you had to create
competition

29:18.131 --> 29:19.466
{\an1}in order to make her
jealous.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.509
All right,
so that was a mistake.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.344
{\an3}But everybody's
frustrated.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.346
Like Kelly is.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.514
{\an3}Like Donna
is with Noah.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.640
Like you are

29:27.724 --> 29:29.100
with the <i> New York Chronicle</i> guy.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.852
You can write that stuff
hands down, Brandon.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.520
You and I may know that.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.022
Unfortunately,
guys like Lou Jessup don't.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.106
{\an3}Well,

29:35.190 --> 29:37.525
maybe it's time he does.

29:48.661 --> 29:50.663
{\an1}I'm sorry
about last night.

29:50.747 --> 29:53.333
Apology not accepted.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.334
Look, I'm trying here.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.336
Then you need to try harder.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.880
You ruined my parents'
anniversary party.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.090
{\an1}Your father
doesn't think so.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.091
I called him this morning.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.511
What did he say?

30:04.594 --> 30:05.261
That he understood.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.513
And you believe him?

30:06.596 --> 30:07.722
Yeah. I do.

30:07.805 --> 30:10.517
Why don't you believe me?

30:10.600 --> 30:11.935
{\an3}Your pain,

30:12.018 --> 30:13.561
I get that.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.522
All I want to do is help you.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.525
(sighs)

30:20.610 --> 30:21.569
{\an1}So, what's going on
with work?

30:21.653 --> 30:22.904
Jankowski call?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.868
Carrie Knox--

30:28.952 --> 30:30.662
they hired her in-house.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.038
I'm out.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.331
There.

people chattering)

30:58.189 --> 31:00.441
This is David Silver

31:16.874 --> 31:18.418
I can't believe
how well he's doing.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.420
Yeah, he's okay.

31:20.503 --> 31:23.423
What do you think?

I think, um...

{\an3}I'm going to the
ladies' room.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.471
(chuckling)

31:30.555 --> 31:31.806
It was smooth, buddy.

31:31.889 --> 31:33.933
{\an3}I was just asking.
Mm-hmm.

31:35.351 --> 31:36.769
{\an1}So, you ready
for your big lunch

31:36.853 --> 31:38.313
{\an5}with Jessup
tomorrow?
Ooh!
You bet.

Serve from the left, clear
from the right, am I right?

31:40.857 --> 31:42.442
(phone ringing)

31:42.525 --> 31:45.445
(sighing): Great, hopefully it's
the station pulling the plug.

31:45.528 --> 31:46.613
Yeah, hello?

31:46.696 --> 31:48.489
It's Sophie.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.533
I'm on the pay phone
by the alley door.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.662
I'm blowing it, aren't I?

31:54.746 --> 31:56.623
I'm so nervous.
David,

31:56.706 --> 31:58.333
stay cool.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.334
I can't.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.335
I'm losing 'em.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.336
Are you?

32:01.419 --> 32:02.879
Do you see anybody walking out?

32:05.089 --> 32:06.841
(indistinct chatter)

32:06.924 --> 32:08.801
I'm telling you, they're yours.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.054
You think so?

32:12.263 --> 32:15.183
Do you have any idea
how exciting you are?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.352
Hearing your voice.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.521
There's something so intimate.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.023
No, no.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.399
You're with Steve.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.485
I don't want to hurt Steve,
I really don't.

32:25.568 --> 32:29.238
When I'm with him,
I'm thinking about you.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.033
Do your show, David.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.077
Think of me.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.713
I miss anything?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.590
No.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.717
Are y'all ready for this?

Some people play
against the house.

Others get the sure thing.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.118
What she wants, she gets.

33:15.201 --> 33:18.705
And you, Carl, you don't want?

33:32.009 --> 33:33.428
I want to play 12.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.555
{\an4}HENRY:
Uh, it only comes
the hard way.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.890
Come to Vegas,
you take your chances.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.475
And if you and I were
back in L.A.?

33:39.559 --> 33:42.603
You mean would I take
a chance on you?

33:42.687 --> 33:44.230
Probably put my money on it.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.315
{\an3}Give me 12.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.819
{\an1}Kelly, why exactly
did you come to Vegas?

33:49.902 --> 33:52.947
Forget my troubles,
same as you.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.699
Have you?

33:57.994 --> 34:00.580
{\an1}Couple of sixes;
boxcars.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.123
Here we go.

{\an1}WOMAN:
Come on!

34:07.253 --> 34:08.713
CROUPIER:
12. High 12.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.972
{\an1}ABBY:
Kelly, you won!

34:18.056 --> 34:20.433
You won again!

34:28.399 --> 34:29.859
{\an1}(zipper closing,
grunts)

34:29.942 --> 34:32.779
Where's my damn shoe?!

34:37.074 --> 34:39.368
Look, Val...

34:39.452 --> 34:40.911
Just go, okay?

35:04.602 --> 35:05.520
{\an1}I'll be catching
a plane home

35:05.603 --> 35:07.021
{\an1}first thing
in the morning.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.617
(sniffles)

35:34.173 --> 35:35.967
Do you, Carl Schmidt,
take this woman

35:36.050 --> 35:38.261
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

35:38.344 --> 35:39.595
I do.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.397
And do you, Abby Malone,

35:49.480 --> 35:52.024
{\an3}take Carl to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

35:52.108 --> 35:53.192
I do.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.701
(ring clangs)

36:09.333 --> 36:11.210
{\an3}Then by the powers
vested in me

36:11.294 --> 36:12.753
{\an1}by the state
of Nevada,

36:12.837 --> 36:14.922
I now pronounce you husband
and wife.

36:17.174 --> 36:20.386
("Wedding March" plays)

36:24.849 --> 36:27.101
I'm very happy for you, Mother.

36:27.184 --> 36:29.854
Oh, baby.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.233
Congratulations.
Thank you.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.568
Carl, is that any way

36:35.651 --> 36:37.528
{\an3}to greet your
new stepdaughter?

36:41.699 --> 36:44.076
(clears throat)

36:56.714 --> 36:59.634
Jankowski hated every design
that I gave him.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.135
He fired me.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.762
Isn't it a little early
in the morning

37:02.845 --> 37:04.555
for wallowing in self-pity?

37:04.639 --> 37:06.933
I was counting on you
not being able to think clearly.

37:07.016 --> 37:10.019
Your charm got you
in the door twice but...

37:10.102 --> 37:11.312
Third time's pushing it.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.480
(phone ringing)
Mmm.

37:12.563 --> 37:13.981
Do you need to get that?

37:14.065 --> 37:15.775
{\an1}The machine
will pick it up.

37:15.858 --> 37:19.111
I... I should've

37:19.195 --> 37:21.322
never come here.
So why did you?

37:21.405 --> 37:23.783
To say I am sorry.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.201
Ah, that's funny.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.078
Why do people think
it's okay to act horribly

37:27.161 --> 37:29.163
as long as you feel badly
about it afterwards?

37:29.246 --> 37:31.165
I do feel badly.

37:31.248 --> 37:32.792
You should.

37:40.591 --> 37:43.344
(on machine):
Donna, Phillip Jankowski.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.722
Listen, about your designs,
I'd like to reconsider.

37:51.894 --> 37:52.687
BRANDON:
<i>Hardly the watering hole</i>

37:52.770 --> 37:55.523
for a correspondent
just in from Kosovo.

37:55.606 --> 37:56.774
{\an3}(chuckles)

37:56.857 --> 37:59.694
{\an6}Tell me, is this how
you always put your
best foot forward?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.070
{\an1}Sorry.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.030
Journalist reflex action.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.158
{\an1}I mean, the other night
it was, uh, Fluffy the cat.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.995
{\an1}You trying to sniff out
a job or not?

38:09.078 --> 38:10.913
Would it help if I
picked up the tab?

38:10.997 --> 38:14.375
Look, truth is, my tennis
buddy's a member here, okay?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.669
He gets me in
whenever I need to impress.

38:16.752 --> 38:17.712
You want to impress me?

38:17.795 --> 38:19.755
Is that so hard to believe?

38:19.839 --> 38:21.674
Frankly, Mr. Jessup, yes, it is.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.467
Lou.
Lou.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.761
Um, it is hard to believe.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.222
{\an3}I mean, the things
that you've seen

38:28.306 --> 38:29.724
and reported on,
I should be so lucky.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.600
I don't get you, kid.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.769
{\an1}I mean, first you come in,
lay all your cards

38:33.853 --> 38:35.229
face up, now you bluff?

38:35.312 --> 38:37.398
{\an1}What kind of poker player
is that?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.608
One who doesn't believe
he has a good hand.

38:39.692 --> 38:44.030
Look, if you didn't call me,
I was gonna call you.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.742
{\an1}I've had my eye on you
for some time, you know.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.452
Now that there's a job opening
up in the L.A. Bureau...

38:50.870 --> 38:52.747
You're offering me a job
at the <i> New York Chronicle?</i>

38:52.830 --> 38:54.582
No, only the guys in New York

38:54.665 --> 38:56.417
can offer you a job
at the <i> New York Chronicle.</i>

38:56.500 --> 38:59.587
{\an1}But I did offer
a recommendation.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.796
And what did they say?

39:00.880 --> 39:03.257
Well...

39:03.340 --> 39:05.092
they want to meet you.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.432
{\an1}Want to hear
something funny?

39:15.352 --> 39:17.605
When you told me
you were selling the boat,

39:17.688 --> 39:20.316
I thought of asking you
to move in with me.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.531
Noah, did you hear what I said?

39:29.825 --> 39:31.494
I want you to move in
with me, okay?

39:31.577 --> 39:34.288
{\an5}(sighs)
There's just one stain
I just can't get out.

39:34.371 --> 39:36.916
Noah, please.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.752
You want to help me?

39:39.835 --> 39:41.170
Leave me alone.

39:45.591 --> 39:48.219
{\an3}My mother found this
in my dad's sock drawer.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.145
"I am sorry

39:58.229 --> 40:00.272
{\an1}"but the burden
of having hurt so many

40:00.356 --> 40:01.941
"leaves me no other choice.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.820
"My greatest regret is
that I made too little time

40:05.903 --> 40:08.489
"for my family, especially Noah,

40:08.572 --> 40:12.201
{\an1}"who I suspect suffered
the most from my absences.

40:12.284 --> 40:16.122
"I've always loved you
and always will.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.833
"Please forgive my weakness.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.418
Dad."

40:23.587 --> 40:24.880
I can't.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.343
What?

40:29.426 --> 40:31.720
I can't forgive his weakness.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.889
{\an3}I can't.

40:33.973 --> 40:36.642
{\an1}It's okay.

40:36.725 --> 40:37.560
{\an3}I can't.

40:37.643 --> 40:40.646
{\an3}It's okay.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.535
Who's Susie?

40:54.618 --> 40:56.579
Well, hello to you, too.

40:56.662 --> 40:57.580
I heard you went to...

40:57.663 --> 40:58.581
Who is she?

40:58.664 --> 41:00.708
...Las Vegas.

41:00.791 --> 41:03.043
I'm assuming you didn't win.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.503
She called you.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.882
{\an1}See, you left your phone
on the deck.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.050
You see, this is my phone.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.760
{\an3}But some car
leasing guy called

41:11.844 --> 41:13.512
on the one that
you brought by,

41:13.596 --> 41:15.681
{\an3}said that he left <i> his</i> phone
at the beach apartment.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.725
Oh, yeah.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.560
{\an3}Aaron Pike.
Aaron Pike.

41:19.643 --> 41:23.689
Yeah, he was trying
to lease me a car.

41:26.609 --> 41:29.778
I'm not seeing
anybody, Kel.

41:29.862 --> 41:33.616
I saw all my stuff
in a box in the foyer.

41:33.699 --> 41:37.912
Every morning I would get up
and see something of yours

41:37.995 --> 41:39.705
and all it did was

41:39.788 --> 41:41.790
remind me that I'm alone.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.419
Where are you going?

41:45.502 --> 41:46.921
New York.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.923
{\an1}For a meeting
with <i> The Chronicle.</i>

41:49.006 --> 41:50.424
Really? That's great.

41:50.507 --> 41:52.635
{\an1}It's for a job here
in L.A., but...

41:52.718 --> 41:56.722
{\an1}yeah, yeah,
it's pretty great.

42:03.812 --> 42:06.607
{\an1}I tried to forget
about you.

42:06.690 --> 42:09.443
Did it work?

42:09.527 --> 42:10.486
No.

42:10.569 --> 42:13.280
But it almost did.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.367
And that makes me sad.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.559
Hey, Steve. Hey.

42:42.643 --> 42:43.936
You just getting up?

42:44.019 --> 42:45.771
Uh, yeah.
(chuckles)

42:45.854 --> 42:47.106
Had kind of a late night.

42:47.189 --> 42:49.775
Oh, last night, man,
you were great, Dave.

42:49.858 --> 42:50.859
Thanks, man.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.194
You want to come in?

42:54.238 --> 42:55.781
Dave, Sophie's not here, is she?

42:55.864 --> 42:58.784
Late last night she went out
again, and I thought maybe...

42:58.867 --> 42:59.952
I haven't seen her.

43:00.035 --> 43:02.830
So you and Sophie are not...

43:02.913 --> 43:04.498
No.
No.

43:04.581 --> 43:06.000
Okay, well, then I guess

43:06.083 --> 43:08.002
I'm sorry for acting
so crazy lately.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.004
I'll see you around.
All right.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.880
Steve?
Yeah?

43:11.964 --> 43:14.591
Uh, you think
I could get my paper?

43:21.598 --> 43:23.600
(door closes)

43:27.980 --> 43:30.357
Think he knows?

43:32.151 --> 43:33.569
I don't know.

43:34.987 --> 43:37.156
Maybe.
