00:14.215 --> 00:16.117
Lee:
This is Carol Brady.

00:16.150 --> 00:19.120
Carol was a supportive,
dedicated, loving mother,

00:19.153 --> 00:21.489
which I think is probably
why I hated her.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.725
Because my mother was
resentful and manipulative,

00:24.758 --> 00:26.026
and watching
"The Brady Bunch"

00:26.060 --> 00:28.662
only made me feel worse
about my own shitty mother.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.365
I mean, look at her.
Whose mother looks like that?

00:31.399 --> 00:33.601
You weren't helping, Carol,
with your perky little hairdo.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.269
You were making me
feel worse,

00:35.303 --> 00:37.671
because it's one thing
to have a shitty mother,

00:37.705 --> 00:40.608
it's another to think
that you're the only one
with a shitty mother.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.676
So fuck you,
Carol Brady.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.846
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

00:45.879 --> 00:48.549
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

00:48.582 --> 00:51.419
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

00:51.452 --> 00:54.255
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

00:54.288 --> 00:57.258
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

00:58.526 --> 01:01.195
Hola, I'm Dora,

01:01.229 --> 01:05.166
and this is my wonderful
grandma Abuela.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.570
Hola, this is my abuela.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.639
Abuela is my grandma.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.208
Can you say "abuela"?

01:14.242 --> 01:15.709
Abuela.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.312
- Great.
- Muy bien!

01:18.346 --> 01:20.848
You said that
very well.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.884
Dora:
Oh, Abuela,
sing us a song.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.753
Boots:
Sing, sing!

01:25.786 --> 01:27.821
Con mucho gusto.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.658
* Mother's called madre *

01:30.691 --> 01:33.194
* Papa is your dad

01:33.227 --> 01:36.330
* Your padres
always love you *

01:36.364 --> 01:38.466
* Even when you're bad.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.869
Hey, buddy, what's the deal
with Dora's mom?

01:41.902 --> 01:42.736
I don't know.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.639
- I mean, where is she?
- I don't know.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.276
- Didn't you ever see her?
- I don't know.

01:48.309 --> 01:51.212
Weird, don't you think?
You never see her mom.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.713
Dora's with Abuela.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.648
Abuela is her grandma.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.550
I know.
It's just weird.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.718
All right,
come on, man.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.487
We gotta go.
Let's not miss the bus.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.455
* Mother's called madre... *

02:01.489 --> 02:03.224
- All right,
fire under it, dude.
- * Papa is your dad

02:03.257 --> 02:05.193
* Your padres
always love you... *

02:05.226 --> 02:07.695
- Come on, come on, come on.
- * Even when you're bad.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.263
* Mother's called madre... *

02:09.297 --> 02:11.732
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- * Papa is your dad

02:11.765 --> 02:14.768
* Padres always love you,
even when you're bad. *

02:14.802 --> 02:16.604
- Here we go. Okay.
- ( singing continues )

02:16.637 --> 02:18.806
Out. Out.
Stay positive.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.710
Thom:
It's not a big deal, Jon.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.478
I'm sure someone
just borrowed it.

02:24.512 --> 02:27.348
Coups begin
with a whisper.

02:27.381 --> 02:30.251
Uh, I thought
they began by cutting
off the king's head.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.919
That's how they end.

02:31.952 --> 02:35.823
They begin with
undetectable but undeniable
acts of derogation,

02:35.856 --> 02:39.660
like stealing
someone's couch.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.961
It's just
a fucking sofa, Jon.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.665
Thom, for the dog
claiming his territory,

02:44.698 --> 02:46.867
it isn't about the tree,
it's about the pissing.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.703
That's what
corporate life is.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.840
It's not about thinking
different or just doing it,

02:52.873 --> 02:55.209
it's about
who's pissing where

02:55.243 --> 02:56.944
and on whom
they are pissing.

02:56.977 --> 03:00.648
Corporate America's
a German porno, Thom.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.850
Someone just took a piss
in your office.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.624
( sighs )

03:10.658 --> 03:12.893
Fuck. Lorna!

03:12.926 --> 03:15.496
- You want your couch
returned immediately...
- I want my fucking sofa

03:15.529 --> 03:17.998
- and the name of the asshole...
- and the person who took it
held responsible.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.269
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I'll find it.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.404
Gottfrid's just called
a Keebler meeting.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.705
A Keebler meeting?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.874
What's Gottfrid doing
calling Keebler meetings?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.742
He asked
that you be there.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.378
It's in Roth.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.413
- What?
- Roth.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.781
What-- what's Roth?

03:33.814 --> 03:36.317
Gustaff and Gottfrid renamed
all the conference rooms.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.618
What-- why?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.019
Because we're creative.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.955
The conference rooms on 22
are named after writers,

03:41.989 --> 03:44.592
the conference rooms on 23
are named after artists,

03:44.625 --> 03:47.361
and the conference rooms
on 24 are named after
film directors.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.365
- Philip or Henry?
- Philip or Henry what?

03:51.399 --> 03:52.933
You said the Keebler
meeting was in Roth.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.602
Is it Philip Roth
or Henry Roth?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.470
There's a Henry Roth?

03:56.504 --> 03:58.639
Just-- where
is the Keebler meeting?

03:58.672 --> 03:59.873
It's across from Miller.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.476
- Arthur or Henry?
- Frank.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.445
There's a Frank Miller?

04:04.478 --> 04:07.581
- He wrote "Batman."
- What the fuck?

04:07.615 --> 04:10.851
Lee's voice:
See, that's why we live
in a bubble now--

04:10.884 --> 04:12.420
me, Thom, Jules.

04:12.453 --> 04:14.322
We've got this
happy little family

04:14.355 --> 04:15.789
and I don't want the world
fuckin' with it.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.892
No Facebook, no Twitter,
no nothing.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.695
Don't fuck
with my fuckin' bubble.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.397
Morning, Kevin.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.499
Hey, there she is.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.602
- There you go.
- Gracias.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.970
Been working
on something big, huh?

04:30.003 --> 04:31.805
Some big, new,
art-type thing?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.442
Uh, no, not really.
Why?

04:34.475 --> 04:36.410
Hang on.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.982
( groans )

04:42.015 --> 04:44.652
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.754
There you go.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.959
- God damn it.
- What is it?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.994
It's a bubble violation.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.630
Ew. Hey,
what's "bubbie" mean?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.399
It's Yiddish for "cunt."

04:58.432 --> 05:01.068
( laughs )
Hey, you need some help?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.570
I got it.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.316
Ugh.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.525
( grunts )

05:53.621 --> 05:54.855
( sighs )

05:54.888 --> 05:58.125
( engine starts )

05:58.158 --> 06:00.728
Woman's voice:
So I sent my grandson
a present.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.862
Is that a crime?

06:01.895 --> 06:05.065
I mean, even in Auschwitz
the children could have toys.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.167
They didn't have toys
in Auschwitz, Ma.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.036
Is there any
discussion with you

06:09.069 --> 06:10.938
that doesn't come back
to the fuckin' Holocaust?

06:10.971 --> 06:13.507
Oh, now it's
the "fucking" Holocaust.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.742
Mazel tov.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.143
God forbid he should
have a present

06:16.176 --> 06:18.846
from his grandmother
once in a while.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.913
Oh, guilt.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.182
Holy shit,
what a surprise.

06:22.215 --> 06:26.420
Ma, if you had wanted
to be a grandmother
to your grandson,

06:26.454 --> 06:29.857
maybe you should have
tried being a mother
to your daughter.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.962
( horn honks )

06:34.995 --> 06:36.730
Hey! Asshole!

06:36.764 --> 06:38.832
Chill out!

06:43.804 --> 06:45.739
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.076
That box I just picked up--
do I have to keep it?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.745
- You don't want it?
- I don't know yet.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.880
Throw it away.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.148
Well, it's not
about the box.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.117
It's about letting
the person who sent it

06:57.150 --> 06:59.019
know that I never
accepted it.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.221
- Why?
- To hurt them.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.223
- Father?
- Mother.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.959
Ah, yeah.
"Revenge to sender."

07:05.993 --> 07:07.461
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.731
Well, we're not supposed
to return to sender

07:10.764 --> 07:12.633
once we hand it over
to the customer,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.935
but a mother package...

07:14.968 --> 07:16.003
Sure, bring it in.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.472
Oh, thank you.
Okay.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.079
Can I have till tomorrow?

07:26.113 --> 07:29.149
- Tomorrow?
- I just don't know yet.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.084
Did you tip me
last Christmas?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.787
Yeah, 50 bucks.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.188
Okay, one day.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.157
And don't fuck it up
and drop it and shit, okay?

07:37.190 --> 07:39.159
- Kevin!
- It's my ass on the line.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.694
- Thank you.
- All right.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.962
Thank you.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.597
Thom:
They're elves, Gottfrid.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.033
50-year-old elves, Thom.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.702
Created in 1968
by Leo Burnett.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.104
I mean, Leo himself
has been dead for 40 years.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.840
When I told that
to the client,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.041
they couldn't believe it.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.544
Sorry, sorry.
You told that to my client?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.646
I'm creative director
in this office, Thom.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.649
I mean,
I tell clients if I think
they need new life.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.117
We invited them
to our office tomorrow
to see new work.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.754
Gottfrid, I've got
a Coke strategy meeting
all afternoon.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.256
When the hell
am I gonna prepare
new work for tomorrow?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.091
You're a busy man,
Thom.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.626
We know that.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.028
Gustaff had an idea
he wanted to share with you.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.230
Oh, good.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.601
So Keebler talks
about real, yes?

08:20.634 --> 08:23.136
Real ingredients, real chips,
real, real, real,

08:23.170 --> 08:26.574
and yet these
are their spokespeople.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.642
Fakes, cartoons.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.711
Why are you always trying
to get rid of elves?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.179
( snaps fingers )

08:37.718 --> 08:39.653
Ernie.

08:39.687 --> 08:40.954
Ma.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.055
J.J.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.057
Fast Eddie.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.893
We want to get rid
of the fake elves.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.761
Thom,
these are real,

08:47.795 --> 08:51.164
just like I'm real
and Keebler fudge is real.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.834
Holy shit, Maya.
Midgets?

08:53.867 --> 08:54.935
Do midgets test well?

08:54.968 --> 08:56.870
Little people, Thom.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.640
Maya:
Reality tests well
with the millenials, Thom.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.042
We have been struggling with
the perception of the elves

09:02.075 --> 09:03.944
as old and out of touch.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.647
They've been asking
for something new.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.649
Man:
Well, I can only speak
for the production department,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.851
but if we never had
to animate another elf,

09:10.884 --> 09:12.185
I'd be thrilled.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.655
- Do you like this idea?
- Yes.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.691
I think it's at least
worth sharing with them.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.193
Jesus.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.962
We do a series
on the web.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.697
Okay?
Where our target lives.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.967
High production values,
top directors.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.336
Not commercials,
but short films, okay?

09:29.369 --> 09:32.039
Let's show these elves
with some real problems.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.742
Real issues.
Real chocolate.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.309
J.J.'s girlfriend dumps him

09:36.343 --> 09:38.679
or Fast Eddie
gets a bad report card.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.815
Real issues
with real people,

09:41.849 --> 09:43.951
because they are real,

09:43.984 --> 09:45.919
just like our fudge.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.387
They would
totally own "real."

09:47.420 --> 09:49.089
Man:
You know who would be
great for this spot?

09:49.122 --> 09:50.290
Lance Acord.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.092
He directed
that great VW spot.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.694
I was thinking Noam Murro.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.129
What about the guy that did
the Willy Wonka films?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.131
He did all that great
Oompa Loompa work.

09:58.165 --> 10:02.703
No, no, a documentarian.
For real.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.037
Ken Burns.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.372
Michael Moore
could be good.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.406
Maya:
Not Michael Moore.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.241
We have to stay
approachable.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.779
Keebler's core attributes
are real and approachable.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.980
Oh.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.048
Yes. Rob Reiner.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.216
Rob Reiner?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.818
Have you seen
"Wolf of the Wall Street"?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.186
He's totally hot
right now.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.188
- Uh-huh.
- He's not a documentarian.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.691
"Spinal Tap."
Best documentary ever.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.693
- "Hello, Cleveland!"
- ( phone buzzing )

10:25.726 --> 10:28.128
That's not
a real documentary.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.830
So?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.865
So, what, you want to use
a fake documentarian

10:31.899 --> 10:34.367
to make a real film
about fake elves

10:34.401 --> 10:35.836
to make them seem real?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.237
"This one goes to 11."

10:37.270 --> 10:39.072
( laughter )

10:39.106 --> 10:40.240
- Hey.
- Lee: How's your day?

10:40.273 --> 10:41.408
Shitty.
Elves are fake.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.076
I'm in a Coke meeting
all afternoon

10:43.110 --> 10:45.412
and my sofa's missing.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.279
You?

10:46.313 --> 10:49.216
Ma sent Jules a present.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.018
Where is it?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.820
On our dining room table.

10:52.853 --> 10:53.954
Oh, Christ, Lee.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.956
Why the fuck
did you bring it home
in the first place?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.258
Because I'm pathetic.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.194
Guy at the post office
said I could bring it
back tomorrow, so...

11:01.228 --> 11:02.295
Take it back now, Lee.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.396
That's not a present
for Julius.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.865
It's a "fuck you" to you.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.800
It's just sitting there,
staring at me.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.202
I haven't done any work.
Not one fucking minute.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.971
Which is precisely
what your mother wanted.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.305
Take it back now, Lee.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.441
Okay. Shit, I've gotta go.
I'll call you later.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.243
Coke meeting at 1:00
in Chayefsky.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.845
- On 22?
- 24.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.013
- Writers are on 22.
- I thought he was a director.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.782
- Why?
- Because he's on 24.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.217
Okay, Lorna,
where the fuck
is the meeting?

11:24.251 --> 11:26.486
It's next to Lee.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.021
Harper.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.289
( scoffs )
Spike.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.324
For fuck's sake.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.999
What is it, Ma?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.769
What'd you get him,
a fuckin' Torah?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.104
From your mouth
to God's ears.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.939
Don't you see
the irony here?

11:45.973 --> 11:48.208
All those years you told me
I was a bad mother,

11:48.241 --> 11:50.243
and here you are sending
your son's present back.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.411
Oh, so I'm the bad mother?

11:51.444 --> 11:54.481
I never sent
your presents back.

11:54.514 --> 11:58.819
Ma, I told you
that I needed some space.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.488
I told you that
I would reach out
to you when I was ready.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.156
Why can you not honor that?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.792
Because I love you.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.927
Oh, please, Ma!

12:06.960 --> 12:09.496
Yeah, you love me.
You just don't... like me.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.099
- I'm your mother, Lee.
- Oh, we're not having
this discussion.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.101
Oh, sure, sure.
Walk away.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.503
God forbid I should
violate your bubble.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.405
We all have tsuris,
zeindeleh,

12:18.438 --> 12:20.440
not just you
and your sheigetz husband!

12:20.473 --> 12:21.441
Shut up!

12:21.474 --> 12:24.211
So that's Gottfrid's
big idea?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
To make the elves real?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.115
Yeah,
he's creative director.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.983
He gets to make
those kinds of decisions.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.119
Maybe if you'd play
the game the way I tell--

12:32.152 --> 12:34.254
Who the fuck
wants to eat cookies

12:34.287 --> 12:35.856
made by real elves

12:35.889 --> 12:38.258
living in a real
fucking tree?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.227
Why are they living
in a tree, Jon?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.461
Are they homeless?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.163
- Where do they shit?
- "Where do they shit"?

12:43.196 --> 12:44.497
Do they have toilets?

12:44.531 --> 12:45.966
I'm asking because
they're real now,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.500
so I want to know
as a Keebler consumer

12:47.534 --> 12:50.337
am I eating cookies
made in a tree

12:50.370 --> 12:52.172
by homeless
little people

12:52.205 --> 12:53.874
who are shitting
all over the floor?

12:53.907 --> 12:56.443
Keebler is not
the goddamn issue, Thom.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.045
Your couch
is the goddamn issue.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.013
Why do you keep talking
about my fucking couch?

13:00.047 --> 13:02.382
- I'm trying to save your job.
- I'm talking about my job.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.884
You're talking about
my goddamn couch.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.418
Thom, you live
in the creative world.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.220
I live
in the corporate world.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.357
And in my world,
a cup isn't a cup,
a couch isn't a couch,

13:10.390 --> 13:12.125
a corner office
isn't a corner office.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.526
It's a cock, Thom.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.062
And everyone
wants the big one.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.330
You know how many men
have a 10-inch penis?

13:17.364 --> 13:20.968
- In this room?
- One in 19,000.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.002
Why do you know this?

13:22.035 --> 13:23.536
Now imagine if every man

13:23.570 --> 13:26.406
could just
steal an inch or two
from another man.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.507
You know,
walking down the street,

13:27.540 --> 13:29.576
or on a bus,
or in a workplace.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.945
Just, bam, now I got
two more inches.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.582
Everyone would be looking
to steal penis inches
from everyone else,

13:35.615 --> 13:37.550
and everyone
would be terrified

13:37.584 --> 13:39.286
that someone
was stealing from them.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.488
That is corporate
America, Thom.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.523
Except the penis
is a coffee cup

13:43.556 --> 13:46.159
or a stapler or a couch
or a corner office.

13:46.193 --> 13:49.897
Your couch
is a corporate-American
memento mori.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.933
So get your head
out of Ernie Keebler's ass

13:52.966 --> 13:55.969
and go find out
who stole your dick.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.205
Bella:
I don't think you should
be sending it back.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.474
- Lee: And why not?
- Because it's not yours.
It's Jules'.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.576
Well, it's not Jules'
until I give it to him.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.246
It's Jules' when
she gets it for him.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.515
Don't you see
what's happening here, Lee?

14:08.548 --> 14:10.951
Because she was
a shitty mother to you,

14:10.984 --> 14:13.220
you're doing something
shitty to Jules.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.089
And that's the hardest part
of being a healthy adult--

14:16.123 --> 14:18.491
is how to protect ourselves
from our lousy parents

14:18.525 --> 14:20.193
without hurting
our children.

14:20.227 --> 14:24.164
Have you noticed
all the fucking grandparents
at school lately?

14:24.197 --> 14:27.367
I mean, what the fuck
is going on?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.669
Drop-offs, pick-ups.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.972
It's weird, right?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.942
Free transportation.
It's not genuine love.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.010
- Don't worry.
- Oh, good.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.994
Ugh.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.163
Oh, you're right.
You're right.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.935
You know who can
go fuck herself?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.270
- Who?
- Dora.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.272
- Dora who?
- The "Explora."

15:05.305 --> 15:08.075
- ( laughs )
- She won't stop with this
Abuela/grandmother shit.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.409
Every episode lately.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.045
It's like, "Do you even
have a fucking mother?"

15:12.079 --> 15:14.414
She's with her grandmother
every fucking day.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.149
Never see her mother.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.618
It's all those
fucking shows, though.

15:18.651 --> 15:22.389
Max and Ruby,
no parents.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.524
The fucking Muppets
don't even have parents.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.494
No parents?
I'd like to be a Muppet.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.330
Right? No periods.
Weight never changes.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.433
Right? And some guy's
got his finger stuck up
your ass all day.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.235
( both laugh )

15:35.268 --> 15:37.237
- Maya: Happiness...
- ( button clicking )

15:37.270 --> 15:39.206
...we all want it.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.540
We all pursue it.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.076
But Coca-Cola owns it.

15:43.110 --> 15:47.314
Coca-Cola has owned happiness
for the past 100 years.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.715
Here I was wasting
my money on Xanax,

15:48.748 --> 15:50.583
and all I needed
was a soda.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.385
- ( laughter )
- Man: Unbelievable.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.653
I hated Xanax.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.189
- I switched to Prozac.
- Prozac made me sleepy.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.557
Lexapro's the bomb, yo.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.460
- I hated Lexapro.
- Maya: Happy pills aside,

16:00.493 --> 16:03.997
today Coca-Cola
has a problem.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.099
There's no joy
in Cokeville,

16:06.133 --> 16:09.469
for mighty America
has struck out.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.703
So this is it?

16:10.737 --> 16:12.472
This is how you're
gonna keep your job,

16:12.505 --> 16:13.740
by dressing
like a teenager?

16:13.773 --> 16:15.275
Oh, fuck you, Thom.
Nice haircut.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.377
How many new clothes
have you bought

16:17.410 --> 16:18.778
since the Swedish invasion?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.648
Nice kicks, by the way,
Jesse Owens.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.184
Didn't figure you
for a runner.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.686
So here's the problem.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.755
War.

16:28.788 --> 16:31.224
Unemployment.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.759
Disillusionment.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.495
I bought these clothes
because of my depression,

16:35.528 --> 16:37.097
if you must know.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.766
Yeah, well,
I bought the push-up bra
because of anxiety.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.701
Well, you look ridiculous.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.337
Please.
You are one Jack Spade
messenger bag away

16:44.371 --> 16:47.274
from full-on
creative-class douchebag.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.109
Maya:
The economy's
in the toilet.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.244
I mean, the country,
it's coming apart at the seams.

16:51.278 --> 16:55.282
And this Internet age,
same as it ever was--

16:55.315 --> 16:56.683
a handful of trillionaires

16:56.716 --> 17:00.753
and billions of poor suckers
who made them that way.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.123
Low expectations,
high unemployment,

17:03.156 --> 17:05.658
they all add up
to the real problem for Coke.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.529
Happiness.
It tests poorly.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.732
So how do we sell happiness

17:12.765 --> 17:15.168
in the age
of disillusionment?

17:15.202 --> 17:16.503
Wow.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.674
This is great.
Great stuff, Maya.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.875
That's really good.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.678
Team, this is the biggest
pitch of the year.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.415
This is the biggest pitch
of the last five years.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.317
And she's right.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.785
That is the $3 billion

17:32.819 --> 17:34.854
annual advertising
budget question.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.424
How do we sell an ice-cold
can of happiness

17:37.457 --> 17:38.725
in a winter of discontent?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.560
Thom, any answers?

17:40.593 --> 17:44.831
- Oh, uh, I'm more
of a misery guy.
- ( laughter )

17:46.366 --> 17:49.702
I'll handle
the Prozac pitch.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.606
Hola! I am Lee,
the ungrateful daughter.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.176
This is my
Yiddishe mama.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.278
Mama is very sad today.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.480
She was sad
yesterday, too.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.749
Mama is sad every day.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.618
Mama says,
"Shver tzu zein a Yid."

18:05.652 --> 18:07.187
That's Yiddish!

18:07.220 --> 18:09.622
It means,
"It's very hard
to be a Jew."

18:09.656 --> 18:11.658
( crying )

18:11.691 --> 18:16.296
Can you say,
"Shver tzu zein a Yid"?

18:16.329 --> 18:19.332
Shver tzu zein a Yid.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.201
Great!

18:21.234 --> 18:22.869
This is Pants.

18:22.902 --> 18:27.640
Pants feels bad because
his pants cost mama
100 dolares.

18:27.674 --> 18:31.344
Mama says dolares
do not grow on trees.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.480
Uh-oh,
we better get Knapsack.

18:33.513 --> 18:35.482
We're going
on a guilt trip!

18:35.515 --> 18:37.384
( crying )

18:37.417 --> 18:40.187
Don't cry,
Yiddishe Mama.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.891
Will you help me and Pants
bring this present to Julius?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.226
Great!

18:46.259 --> 18:48.661
First we have to get
through the Holocaust.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.397
Can you say Holocaust?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.399
Ugh!

18:52.432 --> 18:53.700
Great!

18:58.238 --> 19:01.641
Oh, I always knew
you had talent.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.344
( sighs )

19:04.377 --> 19:05.645
Excuse me?

19:05.678 --> 19:09.382
I told your father,
"She has real talent."

19:09.416 --> 19:10.883
You did?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.685
Oh, I was
so proud of you.

19:12.719 --> 19:17.724
I wanted to be an artist
when I was younger,
you know that?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.792
You wanted to be
an artist?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.529
I never tried, though.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.531
Ma.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.565
Why not?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.200
Well, I was too busy.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.802
You know, or maybe
I was just afraid.

19:29.836 --> 19:34.607
But you-- you I could see
had real ability.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.842
( sighs )

19:35.875 --> 19:37.944
How come you never
told me that?

19:37.977 --> 19:40.713
Why would
I tell you that?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.951
Because you were
my mother, Ma.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.653
But how would that
help you?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.655
I mean, you had
some talent.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.491
Not enough.
I should lie to you?

19:51.524 --> 19:54.561
I mean, a parent's job
is to be honest with
their children.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.997
You had some talent,
but you were never gonna
be Marc Chagall.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.433
I knew that.
We all knew that.

20:00.467 --> 20:04.304
So I should encourage you
to do something you'll fail at?

20:04.337 --> 20:07.440
- Ugh.
- You kids think being a liar
makes you a good parent.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.343
And the truth hurts,
but it's the truth.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.878
It's my job to tell you.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.013
And I'll tell you something
about that husband
of yours, too.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.948
- Mm.
- When the next Holocaust
comes around,

20:15.982 --> 20:17.317
you think
he's gonna save you?

20:17.350 --> 20:18.985
Ha! Let me tell you
something, bubbeleh.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.321
Just because
you married a goy

20:21.354 --> 20:24.991
doesn't mean they're not
gonna throw you and Julius
into the gas chambers.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.326
Bitch!

20:26.359 --> 20:28.928
( both scream )

20:28.961 --> 20:30.730
Ah!

20:30.763 --> 20:32.665
( groans )

20:32.699 --> 20:35.902
You see how
she treats her mother?

20:36.769 --> 20:38.805
My advice as a lawyer--

20:38.838 --> 20:41.007
- send it back now.
- Why?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.710
You don't want her
to have any claim

20:43.743 --> 20:45.011
to a relationship
with Julius.

20:45.044 --> 20:45.912
Mm-mm.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.348
I mean,
if you guys die

20:48.381 --> 20:50.317
or they decide
they want visitations,

20:50.350 --> 20:52.752
they'll have to prove
a relationship.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.754
- ( sighs )
- Honey, it's not even 6:00.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.889
You know what
really bothers me?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.558
Jonathan was right.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.328
It's not just a sofa.
It's not just a box.

21:01.361 --> 21:05.298
These are ghosts.
We're besieged by ghosts.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.834
Your mother lives
a thousand miles away,

21:07.867 --> 21:10.036
and yet she can stop you
from painting.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.806
Fake elves grow old
in a make-believe tree.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.442
And here,
in the middle
of the woods,

21:15.475 --> 21:17.377
in the middle of fucking
Woodstock, New York,

21:17.410 --> 21:19.346
I'm in the shithouse
with my client.

21:19.379 --> 21:23.015
We're haunted
by ghosts and witches.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.387
Double, double,
toil and trouble.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.992
Just like that,
you fuck with our bubble.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.062
* Mother is called madre *

21:36.095 --> 21:38.398
- * Papa is your dad...
- Hey, big J.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.367
- Hey, dude.
You ready to go?
- Yeah.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.769
We're taking Julesy
out to dinner.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.671
- * Mother is called madre *
- ( Lee groaning )

21:44.704 --> 21:46.706
* Papa is your dad...

21:46.739 --> 21:49.942
So are you worried
that he's so into Dora?

21:49.976 --> 21:52.779
I'm not worried
that Jules is into Dora, no.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.980
I'm worried that
the rest of the world

21:54.013 --> 21:55.782
is worried that Julius
is into Dora.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.550
It's not Julius
I got the problem with.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.919
It's the rest of mankind.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.888
'Cause I'd totally fuck Dora.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.723
( laughs )

22:03.756 --> 22:05.725
Wait, Dora, honey,

22:05.758 --> 22:08.327
there's something I want
to explore with you.

22:09.596 --> 22:10.863
It's a joke.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.131
Lee:
You want to keep it,
you can.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.066
If you want to send it back,
we can do that, too.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.735
Thom:
Your call, buddy.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.836
You want to keep it?

22:16.869 --> 22:18.638
Julius:
Why did she send it?

22:18.671 --> 22:20.006
Lee:
I don't know.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.974
Julius:
Did I ever meet her?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.710
When you were a baby.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.545
I think maybe
she's getting old now

22:25.578 --> 22:27.914
and she just wants
to get to know you better.

22:27.947 --> 22:31.584
How come she doesn't
ever come over?

22:31.618 --> 22:33.853
Well, you know,
we didn't get along
so much.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.822
How come?

22:37.524 --> 22:39.859
My mother didn't really
love me very much.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.661
Mm?

22:41.694 --> 22:44.464
Some mothers
are like that.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.466
And some fathers,
too, yeah.

22:46.499 --> 22:50.136
- Hey, but not yours.
- ( laughing )

22:50.169 --> 22:51.638
So what do you think,
buddy?

22:51.671 --> 22:52.872
Do you want to keep it?

22:52.905 --> 22:55.975
Well, I do like presents.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.010
Oh, everybody
likes presents.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.880
It could be Dora's
Magical Castle Playhouse.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.081
Yeah, it could be.
It could be.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.483
Could be a Torah.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.117
A thousand yarmulkes.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.786
- If we send it back...
- Lee: Mm-hmm.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.421
...can we go to the store

23:08.455 --> 23:10.757
and get Dora's Magical
Castle Playhouse?

23:10.790 --> 23:12.792
Sure, buddy.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.961
Muchos gracias!

23:14.994 --> 23:17.029
- ( laughing )
- Hey, nice, dude.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.566
- * Your mother
is called madre... *
- No, please don't.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.068
- Both: * Papa is your dad...
- No! No!

23:22.101 --> 23:24.003
* Your papa
always loves you *

23:24.036 --> 23:25.838
- Stop it.
- * Even when you're bad.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.907
Excuse me.
We'll take the check
now please.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.642
- * Your mother
is called madre... *
- Lee: No, please!

23:29.676 --> 23:31.811
* Papa is your dad

23:31.844 --> 23:34.981
* Your papa
always loves you *

23:35.014 --> 23:37.784
* Even when you're bad.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.219
- No? Sorry. Okay.
- ( laughs )

23:40.252 --> 23:43.055
Maya:
We think
this is a big idea

23:43.089 --> 23:46.493
and we know reality
tests well with millenials.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.060
We've been struggling
with the perceptions

23:48.094 --> 23:50.797
of the elves as old
and out of touch.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.232
Debbie:
We know this is
a new idea for you,

23:53.265 --> 23:57.036
but we think stepping back
from animation could help.

23:57.069 --> 23:59.071
Gives the brand new life.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.140
It'll really
move the needle.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.676
Maya:
We have a unique window
of opportunity here.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.845
Let's humanize this brand--

24:05.878 --> 24:09.148
Cookies, milk,
mother, home.

24:09.181 --> 24:12.018
It's more than a cookie.
It's a philosophy.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.654
Debbie:
We need to think
outside the cookie box.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.489
At the end of the day,

24:16.523 --> 24:18.958
all we're really changing
is the approach.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.094
Your core values
never change.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.497
We think it's a big idea.

24:24.531 --> 24:27.500
Not a one-year idea,
but a 10-year idea.

24:27.534 --> 24:31.538
It has, uh, legs,
as they say.

24:33.573 --> 24:37.844
- Well, it's definitely new.
- ( whispering )

24:37.877 --> 24:41.548
Woman:
I'm just not sure
what Kevin is gonna think.

24:41.581 --> 24:46.118
I think I'd like to get it
in front of some focus groups.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.687
Thom,
what do you think?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.188
Yeah, you're creative
director on this.

24:49.221 --> 24:54.126
Um, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.129
I think we're happy.

24:57.163 --> 25:00.132
- We're happy.
- Great. We are, too.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.301
Good work, Gustaff.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.803
It's Gottfrid.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.705
Oh, I'm so sorry.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.006
( women gasp )

25:07.039 --> 25:08.741
- Debbie: Thom,
are you okay?
- Yes.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.142
Well,
that's gonna stain.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.946
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, just--
you can keep it.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.820
Lee's voice:
You know, I used to think
my mother didn't like Thom

25:20.853 --> 25:23.155
because he wasn't Jewish.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.024
And then I realized
that she hated him

25:25.057 --> 25:27.326
because he made me happy.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.663
It was the happiness
that really bugged her.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.066
In a Jewish wedding,

25:34.100 --> 25:36.302
you smash a glass
to remind you

25:36.335 --> 25:38.871
of the destruction
of the ancient Holy Temple,

25:38.905 --> 25:42.174
to remind you, basically,
that shit happens.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.311
The rabbis, see,
they didn't even want you

25:45.344 --> 25:47.213
to have a single day,

25:47.246 --> 25:50.249
not even your
fucking wedding day,

25:50.282 --> 25:52.919
that didn't have
some misery in it,

25:52.952 --> 25:55.087
some shit.

25:55.121 --> 25:57.724
So I decided
not to do it.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.258
Not to break the glass.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.893
Mother went crazy.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.763
"Why?" she cried.
"Why?"

26:03.796 --> 26:06.332
"Because," I said.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.802
"Because you don't fuck
with my fucking bubble."

26:09.836 --> 26:11.771
( glass breaks )

26:19.679 --> 26:20.913
( exhales )

26:20.947 --> 26:22.281
Wait!

26:27.186 --> 26:29.221
( sighs )

26:30.957 --> 26:34.226
Yeah. Yeah. Uh.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.801
Feels good, doesn't it?

26:41.834 --> 26:43.002
I think I just came.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.170
( laughs )

26:44.203 --> 26:46.172
( glass breaks )

26:46.205 --> 26:49.341
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:49.375 --> 26:51.911
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

26:51.944 --> 26:54.847
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

26:54.881 --> 26:57.383
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

26:57.416 --> 27:00.052
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

27:00.086 --> 27:03.089
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:03.122 --> 27:05.725
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

27:05.758 --> 27:08.027
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:08.060 --> 27:11.030
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

27:11.063 --> 27:13.933
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:13.966 --> 27:16.836
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

27:16.869 --> 27:19.405
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:19.438 --> 27:22.074
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

27:22.108 --> 27:24.944
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

27:24.977 --> 27:27.379
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

27:27.413 --> 27:30.249
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

27:30.282 --> 27:33.085
* If you're happy and you
know it, then your face
will surely show it *

27:33.119 --> 27:36.655
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *
