He might have too good

He's an addict.

00:10.782 --> 00:12.916
I need to put $200
on the Cardinals.

00:12.951 --> 00:15.452
I'm here to collect
on a debt. $30,000.

00:15.487 --> 00:18.781
Jimmy, your bookie, came here.
I paid him everything you owe.

00:18.782 --> 00:20.312
It was... it was just a
mistake, all right?

00:20.336 --> 00:21.837
Look, I made one bet.
That was it.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.904
- I need you to leave.
<i>- Give Christine</i>

00:23.939 --> 00:25.939
a kiss for me
and tell her I love her.

00:25.974 --> 00:30.877
If you wanted to come by,
read her a book, tuck her in...

00:30.912 --> 00:33.913
My name is Seeley,
and I have a gambling addiction.

00:33.949 --> 00:37.050
Welcome, Seeley.
I'm here today because, uh,

00:37.085 --> 00:41.054
I want to get my life back

Aha! I knew you
were in here!

01:09.451 --> 01:13.353
Roar! The hug monster's coming
for you!

01:13.388 --> 01:16.222
I'm going back to my castle.

01:16.258 --> 01:19.292
Monsters can't catch me there.
Oh, no!

01:19.327 --> 01:21.227
Not the castle.
Oh, oh. Daddy!

01:21.263 --> 01:23.830
Oh, no. The hug monster. If he
won't be able to get his hugs,

01:23.865 --> 01:25.532
he's gonna die.

01:25.567 --> 01:28.702
Oh! You saved me!

01:28.737 --> 01:31.471
What happened
to Daddy?

01:31.506 --> 01:34.474
He was dying
'cause he needed a hug.

01:34.509 --> 01:35.875
And she saved me.

01:35.911 --> 01:37.811
Well, thank goodness.

01:37.846 --> 01:40.146
I'm sorry
I'm late.

01:40.182 --> 01:42.348
There were some remains that...
No, no problem. Uh...

01:42.384 --> 01:44.818
there's no better place
I'd rather be.

01:44.853 --> 01:47.454
Can't Daddy stay? Please?

01:52.127 --> 01:54.360
You know what, sweetheart,
I got a...

01:54.396 --> 01:56.129
I got a meeting
I have to get to.

01:56.164 --> 01:58.298
It's really, really important,
okay?

01:58.333 --> 02:00.133
Listen, I got you coconut
ice cream. It's in the freezer

02:00.168 --> 02:02.035
for you and the little guy
to have a little

02:02.070 --> 02:04.671
coconut ice cream.
Thank you.

02:04.706 --> 02:06.573
Uh, how are you?

02:06.608 --> 02:08.875
Good. Determined.

02:08.910 --> 02:12.879
Oh.

02:12.914 --> 02:14.681
Brennan.

02:14.716 --> 02:18.618
Oh. Uh,
o-okay.

02:18.653 --> 02:20.420
Of-of course.

02:20.455 --> 02:22.355
Bye.

02:22.390 --> 02:25.325
A body, uh, just came into
the lab for identification.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.626
You know what,
you go.

02:26.661 --> 02:28.328
I can stay here.
There's other meetings.

02:28.363 --> 02:30.396
No. You-you should go.
I want you to.

02:30.432 --> 02:33.166
It's important. I-I'll call Max.

02:33.201 --> 02:35.068
All right. You sure?

02:35.103 --> 02:36.703
Yes.

02:36.738 --> 02:39.606
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
another hug to stay strong.

02:39.641 --> 02:42.609
Oh! She got me. Oh.

02:42.644 --> 02:44.577
Oh! Ooh,
I need the energy.

02:44.613 --> 02:47.614
Ah! I'm alive now.
I got my hugs. I'm ready to go.

02:47.649 --> 02:51.551
Oh. Careful.
Sorry.

02:51.586 --> 02:54.087
All right. See you.

02:56.925 --> 02:59.959
You have some coconut ice cream,
okay?

03:14.309 --> 03:18.011
A team of volunteers discovered
the remains

03:18.046 --> 03:19.946
while cleaning up after a fire

03:19.981 --> 03:21.948
in George Washington
National Park.

03:21.983 --> 03:23.550
I heard it took firefighters
nearly three days

03:23.585 --> 03:25.151
to put out the blaze.

03:25.187 --> 03:26.884
Isn't he
supposed to be black?

03:26.908 --> 03:27.488
Well,

03:27.489 --> 03:30.290
the fire retardant that they use
is called red slurry.

03:30.325 --> 03:33.159
It's a mixture of water
and ammonium phosphate.

03:33.195 --> 03:35.161
And our guy here is drenched
in the stuff.

03:35.197 --> 03:36.496
Could be an unfortunate hiker
who didn't outrun

03:36.531 --> 03:38.064
the fire.
I thought Dr. B

03:38.099 --> 03:40.099
would be here.
She's waiting for Max.

03:40.135 --> 03:42.035
The separation must
be the worst.

03:42.070 --> 03:45.071
I cannot imagine not seeing
Michael Vincent every day.

03:45.106 --> 03:47.540
Booth is doing okay. He knows
he's got a gambling problem.

03:47.576 --> 03:50.610
He's handling it.
He's worked through this once before.

03:50.645 --> 03:52.545
He can do it again.
These bones are

03:52.581 --> 03:54.180
also heavily fractured.
And based on the lack

03:54.216 --> 03:56.216
of discoloration on
the fracture margins,

03:56.251 --> 03:59.319
the injuries are postmortem.
Well, once again, you can thank

03:59.354 --> 04:01.287
the red slurry for that.
The weight of the water

04:01.323 --> 04:03.189
and the force
in which it hit the remains

04:03.225 --> 04:04.791
would have been enormous.

04:04.826 --> 04:06.860
Easily enough to have caused
the excessive fracturing.

04:06.895 --> 04:08.461
Lucky for us,
all we have to do is get an I.D.

04:08.496 --> 04:11.798
Which seems like enough
of a challenge.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.926
Glad to see someone
appreciates my coffee.

04:20.950 --> 04:21.675
Uh, "tolerate."

04:21.676 --> 04:24.244
That might be the word you're
looking for. Listen, I really...

04:24.279 --> 04:26.274
I really appreciate
everything you've done.

04:26.298 --> 04:27.648
Yeah. Hey,

04:27.649 --> 04:29.549
you know what, you did the work.
I'm having your 30-day chip

04:29.584 --> 04:31.284
engraved as we speak.

04:31.319 --> 04:32.752
No, no, no. I don't want
to make a big deal about this.

04:32.787 --> 04:35.355
Let's not do that.
That's too bad.

04:35.390 --> 04:36.789
I'm ordering a cake.
Cake?

04:36.825 --> 04:38.791
I'm writing a speech.
S... No.

04:38.827 --> 04:41.527
And I'm sure
your wife's gonna want to come.

04:41.563 --> 04:44.564
I don't know. - Okay.
I really don't know about that.

04:44.599 --> 04:47.834
You know I still have a lot
of work I got to do.

04:47.869 --> 04:50.169
Yeah, but you always will.
Yeah.

04:50.205 --> 04:53.512
Yeah. Well, it's important
to celebrate the victories, too.

04:53.536 --> 04:54.241
Yeah.

04:54.242 --> 04:57.877
So why don't we just celebrate
those victories here, among us.

04:57.913 --> 05:00.179
Sure.

05:00.215 --> 05:01.481
It's up to you.

05:01.516 --> 05:03.983
Yep.
All right.

05:05.487 --> 05:07.520
<i>Based on the large</i>

05:07.555 --> 05:10.590
ovoid obturator foramen,
the victim was a male.

05:10.625 --> 05:14.027
The fine texture
of the pubic surfaces

05:14.062 --> 05:17.830
indicates an age range
of mid- to late 30s.

05:17.866 --> 05:19.065
The parabolic dental arch
suggests Caucasian.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.734
Yeah, and the giant metal plate

05:21.770 --> 05:23.036
in his head suggests a cyborg.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.904
Not just his head.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.540
There's fixation
to the right fibula and tibia.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.409
Evidence of injuries
commonly sustained

05:29.444 --> 05:31.377
in motorcycle accidents.
Uh, I'm gonna start

05:31.413 --> 05:33.713
the facial reconstruction.
Hey, Dr. B.

05:33.748 --> 05:35.882
How's everything at home?
Fine. Why do you ask?

05:35.917 --> 05:38.217
Listen, Christine can always
come over and hang out

05:38.253 --> 05:40.653
with Michael Vincent.
I know how hard this is.

05:40.689 --> 05:43.022
You've never been separated
from your child,

05:43.058 --> 05:45.058
so that statement is false.
Sorry. No.

05:45.093 --> 05:46.659
I just... I meant...
I appreciate your concern.

05:46.695 --> 05:48.428
But I'm fine. As is Christine.

05:48.463 --> 05:50.430
And Booth,
as far as I can glean.

05:50.465 --> 05:55.134
Is there anything you or anyone
would like to know?

05:57.505 --> 06:00.239
No. Okay.

06:00.275 --> 06:03.142
Uh, I was going through scraps
of charred clothing

06:03.178 --> 06:05.812
and, uh, found something.
A wallet with a driver's license

06:05.847 --> 06:07.914
would be good.
Well, this is even better.

06:07.949 --> 06:09.749
So, under the fire retardant,
I found a mixture

06:09.784 --> 06:11.651
of hydrocarbons,
antiknock agents...

06:11.686 --> 06:13.820
The victim was doused
in gasoline.

06:13.855 --> 06:15.375
I have a feeling that
he was the source

06:15.390 --> 06:16.990
of the forest fire.
Well, you don't light

06:17.025 --> 06:20.526
a body on fire unless you're
trying to cover something up.

Couldn't hurt.

Multiple charges of felony
assault, grand theft auto.

07:22.087 --> 07:23.986
Really loved his work.
Stanbow was a member

07:24.022 --> 07:26.155
of a biker gang
called the Damned.

07:26.191 --> 07:29.492
Uh, they're a
small group, tight.

07:29.527 --> 07:31.494
Stanbow served as the muscle.

07:31.529 --> 07:32.962
Why didn't
we, uh,

07:32.997 --> 07:35.164
hear of these guys before?
Well, their leader,

07:35.200 --> 07:37.567
a guy named Dale Brock, was
busted on racketeering charges

07:37.602 --> 07:39.961
five years ago.
So they've been laying low.

07:39.985 --> 07:40.637
Really, really...

I'm proud of you, too.
We don't need the gushy stuff, okay?

07:46.444 --> 07:48.396
We're-we're just...
we're working here, okay?

07:48.419 --> 07:49.178
Okay.

07:49.180 --> 07:51.247
I'm just saying, with everything
that's going on with you,

07:51.282 --> 07:53.116
the fact that you're
still killing it at work,

07:53.151 --> 07:55.218
I'm impressed.
Okay. Stop talking.

07:55.253 --> 07:57.253
Let's just concentrate
on the case, okay?

07:57.288 --> 07:58.454
Let's do that.

07:58.490 --> 08:00.590
Okay.
All right.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.326
Aren't you coming up on 30 days,
though? Don't you get a chip?

08:03.361 --> 08:05.595
Take a bite of the donut, okay?
You'll stop talking.

08:05.630 --> 08:07.296
Okay.

08:07.332 --> 08:08.698
Oh. Here you go.

08:08.733 --> 08:10.500
Dale Brock.

08:10.535 --> 08:13.169
He got out of prison four days ago.
That was the same day

08:13.204 --> 08:15.404
that our victim was set on fire.
I'm guessing

08:15.440 --> 08:16.873
that's not a coincidence.

08:16.908 --> 08:19.942
<i> This place looks</i>
<i>a little different</i>

08:19.978 --> 08:22.278
than I remember.
You guys do a little remodeling?

08:22.313 --> 08:24.247
Okay. We get it, Dale.

08:24.282 --> 08:27.783
You're a big tough biker that
isn't intimidated by the FBI.

08:27.819 --> 08:29.385
Look... look, why don't you
just, uh, tell us a little bit

08:29.420 --> 08:31.254
about your friend
Micah Stanbow.

08:31.289 --> 08:34.357
I haven't seen him since I went
to the pen, over five years ago.

08:34.392 --> 08:35.525
So he didn't look like that

08:35.559 --> 08:36.893
the last time
you saw him?

08:36.928 --> 08:40.363
Damn, man. That's Micah?

08:40.398 --> 08:43.366
What the hell they do to him?
They killed him.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.890
Set him on fire four days ago,
same time you got out of prison.

08:45.891 --> 08:47.591
So you think I did it?
Well, we got evidence

08:47.592 --> 08:49.334
that suggests that he was
gonna leave your gang.

08:49.358 --> 08:50.206
Which must've

08:50.208 --> 08:53.276
pissed you off, being betrayed
by somebody so close to you.

08:53.311 --> 08:55.878
Six years ago, Micah got
himself in a gnarly wreck.

08:55.914 --> 08:58.981
He went over the bars
doing 50. It's kind of hard

08:59.017 --> 09:01.651
to get back up on a bike
after a ride like that.

09:01.686 --> 09:04.453
So you want us to believe that
you just let him leave the gang?

09:04.489 --> 09:05.755
Like I said,

09:05.790 --> 09:07.123
I haven't seen Micah in years.

09:07.158 --> 09:08.291
That's hard to believe.

09:08.326 --> 09:09.792
Well, it's the truth.

09:09.827 --> 09:12.094
Now, unless you have something
to hold me on,

09:12.130 --> 09:16.032
I'm gonna get up
and walk my big ass out of here.

09:17.669 --> 09:20.136
Have a nice day, fellas.

09:26.578 --> 09:28.511
<i>Hey, Angie. So, I found this</i>

09:28.546 --> 09:30.980
<i>wrapped</i>
<i>around the victim's wrist.</i>

09:31.015 --> 09:32.648
I tried to clean it off a bit.

09:32.684 --> 09:36.619
Looks like some kind of symbol
on it.

09:36.654 --> 09:39.956
Maybe we can figure out
what it signifies.

09:42.493 --> 09:45.127
Why do you have
your passport out?

09:45.163 --> 09:46.262
No, Hodgi...

09:46.297 --> 09:49.899
Oh... my... God.

09:49.934 --> 09:52.935
Your real name.
Hey. Hey.

09:52.971 --> 09:55.404
My real name
is Angela Montenegro.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.839
Is that right?
Okay.

09:56.874 --> 09:59.575
Then who is Pookie Noodlin?

09:59.611 --> 10:02.211
You know what, don't say
that name out loud here.

10:02.247 --> 10:04.247
I cannot believe
that after all of this time,

10:04.282 --> 10:07.149
I finally know
my wife's real name.

10:07.185 --> 10:09.785
It's like something
you name a pet.

10:09.821 --> 10:12.221
That you hate.
Why didn't you ever get it...

10:12.257 --> 10:14.757
get it, you know,
legally changed?

10:14.792 --> 10:16.459
My dad. He...

10:16.494 --> 10:18.494
It just meant
something important to him,

10:18.529 --> 10:20.663
and he begged me to leave it
un-until he...

10:20.698 --> 10:22.498
That's
so sweet.

10:22.533 --> 10:25.601
I can't believe this.
I'm married to Pookie Noodlin.

10:25.637 --> 10:27.803
Not if you keep saying it
out loud you're not.

10:27.839 --> 10:30.006
One more time.
Hodgins, I'm serious.

10:30.041 --> 10:31.240
I am, too.

10:31.276 --> 10:33.643
Come on.
This is important to me, Angie.

10:33.678 --> 10:36.479
Okay. Go ahead.

10:36.514 --> 10:39.382
I love you, Pookie Noodlin.

10:44.422 --> 10:47.056
All right,
we should do a global search

10:47.091 --> 10:49.792
for the symbol on the bracelet.

10:49.827 --> 10:53.829
Why did you pull your passport
out anyway, Angela?

10:53.865 --> 10:56.337
We haven't traveled
anywhere together for years.

10:56.361 --> 10:57.000
Well, 'cause I had

10:57.001 --> 10:58.434
to get it renewed.

10:58.469 --> 11:01.704
In case we ever actually
do want to go to Paris.

11:01.739 --> 11:03.806
Paris.

11:03.841 --> 11:06.709
Yeah. Paris.

11:06.744 --> 11:08.978
Oh, okay.

11:09.013 --> 11:12.081
Uh, looks like it's the
ancient Sanskrit symbol,

11:12.116 --> 11:13.683
meaning "warrior."

11:13.718 --> 11:17.019
He was into yoga?
Hold on.

11:17.055 --> 11:21.090
I just typed in "Micah Stanbow
yoga", and look what comes up.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.360
Right foot to left thigh.

11:24.395 --> 11:27.063
Arms above your head
in a tree pose.

11:27.098 --> 11:28.831
Oh. Wow. How does a guy go

11:28.866 --> 11:31.100
from being the muscle
in a violent biker gang

11:31.135 --> 11:34.070
to leading a yoga class
full of soccer moms?

11:38.701 --> 11:41.127
So the Bureau had an
informant in the biker world.

11:41.196 --> 11:42.495
No one had a bounty out

11:42.531 --> 11:44.297
on the victim's head,
there was no chatter

11:44.332 --> 11:46.699
of any kind of rival
gangs going after him.

11:46.735 --> 11:48.250
Micah really did leave
that world behind.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.503
Seems like it.

11:49.504 --> 11:51.905
He's been running his own
yoga studio for the past year.

11:51.940 --> 11:55.075
But Micah had been in
a serious motorcycle accident.

11:55.110 --> 11:59.145
He most likely discovered yoga
as a means of rehab.

11:59.181 --> 12:02.148
In addition to increased
flexibility and strength,

12:02.184 --> 12:06.352
practicing yoga also provides
a myriad of mental benefits.

12:06.388 --> 12:08.455
Hmm. Myriad, huh?

12:08.490 --> 12:11.091
Yes, it means "large in number."
I know what it means.

12:11.126 --> 12:12.926
It's just, you know, it's
a funny word, that's all.

12:12.961 --> 12:14.461
I miss your funny words, Bones.

12:14.496 --> 12:16.663
Funny. Funny, ha, ha,
funny, peculiar.

12:16.698 --> 12:19.199
Just funny, you
know? You get it.

12:19.234 --> 12:20.667
Listen, I'm
just... I'm glad

12:20.702 --> 12:22.869
you came along today,
Bones, that's all.

12:22.904 --> 12:24.370
We're partners.

12:24.406 --> 12:28.208
We have a case to solve.

12:31.413 --> 12:33.880
Come on, Bones, why can't
we just go in there, huh?

12:33.915 --> 12:35.555
They're in the middle
of shavasana, Booth.

12:35.584 --> 12:37.383
It's an important
part of the practice.

12:37.419 --> 12:38.952
They'll be done soon.

12:38.987 --> 12:41.354
Whatever. Look at this, huh?

12:41.389 --> 12:44.290
What is this? For 90 bucks,
you can "be closer to nature

12:44.326 --> 12:46.960
with a tablet case
made of 100% Tibetan bamboo"?

12:46.995 --> 12:48.361
What a racket.

12:48.396 --> 12:49.696
They're done, Booth.

12:49.731 --> 12:52.031
Oh. Yup. Let's go.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.801
Ah...
Hi, Mike.

12:54.836 --> 12:56.970
Think it would kill 'em
to crack a window.

12:57.005 --> 12:58.571
Well, they just
finished working out.

12:58.607 --> 13:00.306
Booth, come on.

13:00.342 --> 13:03.309
You two look like
you're having fun.

13:03.345 --> 13:04.911
FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

13:04.946 --> 13:06.412
This here's my partner,

13:06.448 --> 13:08.181
Dr. Temperance Brennan.
Is this your studio?

13:08.216 --> 13:10.783
My boyfriend Micah
and I run the place together.

13:10.819 --> 13:12.352
Is there a problem?

13:12.387 --> 13:14.587
Your boyfriend's remains
were found in a forest.

13:14.623 --> 13:16.623
He was murdered.

13:16.658 --> 13:19.292
That can't be.

13:19.327 --> 13:20.727
I mean, you must be mistaken.

13:20.762 --> 13:22.162
Unfortunately, we're not.

13:22.197 --> 13:23.808
When was the last time
you saw Micah?

13:23.832 --> 13:25.132
Um,

13:25.133 --> 13:27.400
four days ago?

13:27.435 --> 13:29.602
That's the same day
the forest fire started.

13:29.638 --> 13:31.104
He was in that fire?

13:31.139 --> 13:32.505
I'm sorry. Is there a reason

13:32.541 --> 13:34.607
why you didn't report
your boyfriend missing?

13:34.643 --> 13:36.943
Micah was on a silence retreat.

13:36.978 --> 13:38.878
He'd go up to the mountains
or the woods

13:38.914 --> 13:41.648
for a few days to meditate.
Well, if he'd gone into the woods

13:41.683 --> 13:43.116
all alone, someone must have
been following him.

13:43.151 --> 13:44.484
Who would want
to kill Micah?

13:44.519 --> 13:46.486
Everyone loved him.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.555
There was a yoga
studio down the street

13:48.590 --> 13:50.123
that looks closed.

13:50.158 --> 13:52.492
Did some of his students
formerly take classes there?

13:52.527 --> 13:53.860
Yes, but

13:53.895 --> 13:55.728
Micah didn't solicit them.

13:55.764 --> 13:56.716
What about the owner
he put out of business?

13:56.740 --> 13:58.165
A good man.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.499
With a good soul.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.968
There's no way
he would kill Micah.

14:12.681 --> 14:16.482
Hey, I was just, uh, decrypting
the victim's computer.

14:16.518 --> 14:17.850
What's up?

14:17.886 --> 14:20.453
I need your help.

14:23.258 --> 14:24.891
Oh.

14:24.926 --> 14:26.693
Paris real estate again, huh?

14:26.728 --> 14:28.895
Yeah. Sometimes

14:28.930 --> 14:30.370
it's nice to break up
a heinous crime

14:30.398 --> 14:31.998
with a little bit of a dream.

14:32.033 --> 14:33.282
And I couldn't remember
which one you liked.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.301
Oh.

14:34.302 --> 14:35.735
I liked this one.

14:35.770 --> 14:38.104
Remember, I told you
it was close to that, uh...

14:38.139 --> 14:40.206
the great bilingual school
for Michael Vincent?

14:40.242 --> 14:41.808
Yes, that's right. Yup.

14:41.843 --> 14:44.510
Well, back to reality.
What are you working on?

14:44.546 --> 14:48.781
Right, yeah, so, this is
the victim's right sandal.

14:48.817 --> 14:51.484
Uh, the plastic melted
in the fire, and in the process,

14:51.519 --> 14:53.645
encased particulates
within the treads.

14:53.669 --> 14:54.688
Oh.

14:54.689 --> 14:55.912
So you can track his route
through the woods.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.024
Yeah, that's right.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.791
If we can retrace his steps,
we may be able

14:58.827 --> 15:00.793
to find some evidence on the
person who was following him.

15:00.829 --> 15:02.595
The victim wasn't followed
into the woods.

15:02.631 --> 15:05.732
According to a complete
rupturing of the muscle tissue

15:05.767 --> 15:08.735
around the victim's shoulders,
he was dragged out there.

15:17.746 --> 15:21.714
Okay, pal, time to float
back on down to Earth there.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.983
Hello? Hi.

15:24.019 --> 15:27.153
Sorry to bother you, but we just
have a murder to discuss.

15:27.188 --> 15:30.089
I'm quite certain I have
no knowledge of any murders.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.458
Micah Stanbow was killed
four days ago.

15:34.429 --> 15:36.095
Micah was a friend.

15:36.131 --> 15:38.598
Really? 'Cause in the span
of a year, you went from running

15:38.633 --> 15:41.067
one of the most profitable
yoga studios

15:41.102 --> 15:43.670
to teaching seniors
down at the Y.

15:43.705 --> 15:45.872
That didn't piss you off?

15:45.907 --> 15:49.142
A wise man is not a slave
to his emotions.

15:49.177 --> 15:53.279
No, but even the best of us
can get mugged by them.

15:53.315 --> 15:55.295
So, where were you four days
ago, Ramish? Hmm?

15:55.319 --> 15:56.550
At home.

15:56.551 --> 16:00.086
I was involved in an
intensive meditation practice

16:00.121 --> 16:01.821
which I break up with
mindful gardening.

16:01.856 --> 16:03.256
Let me guess.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.158
You live alone?

16:05.193 --> 16:06.659
Yes.

16:06.695 --> 16:08.094
So, no alibi

16:08.129 --> 16:10.797
for the time
of your <i> friend's</i> murder.

16:10.832 --> 16:14.367
It seems
that Micah's life and mine

16:14.402 --> 16:17.570
have many karmic entanglements.

16:17.605 --> 16:20.773
Perhaps I should call my
attorney to help sort them out.

16:28.149 --> 16:31.050
Well, I wasn't able
to find anything on the flesh

16:31.086 --> 16:32.585
that could help
pinpoint cause of death.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.953
Of course you couldn't.

16:33.988 --> 16:35.555
Excuse me?

16:35.590 --> 16:37.156
Oh.

16:37.192 --> 16:38.791
Sorry. I-I didn't
mean it like that.

16:38.827 --> 16:40.960
It's just that these bones
are pretty messed up,

16:40.995 --> 16:42.895
and I'm a bit overwhelmed
right now myself.

16:42.931 --> 16:44.997
It's all right,
Wendell. Just breathe.

16:46.868 --> 16:48.402
Maybe we could both
use a yoga class.

16:50.772 --> 16:52.472
Ooh.

16:53.908 --> 16:55.208
What is this?

16:55.243 --> 16:56.676
Yes.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.411
Oh, yes!
Wow.

16:58.446 --> 17:00.513
After just one deep breath.
The damage

17:00.548 --> 17:02.515
to the left zygomatic
appears to have

17:02.550 --> 17:05.251
radiating fracture lines, which
points to a perimortem injury.

17:05.286 --> 17:07.653
So, he was struck
in the face.

17:07.689 --> 17:09.689
And based
on the indistinct edges,

17:09.723 --> 17:11.124
plus a heavy degree
of fracture lines,

17:11.159 --> 17:13.259
the injury was caused
by some kind

17:13.294 --> 17:14.694
of rounded object.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.329
Nice work, Mr. Bray.

17:17.365 --> 17:18.897
It's not specific enough.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.532
And the injury wouldn't have
been enough to kill him.

17:20.568 --> 17:21.901
It's a start.

17:21.935 --> 17:23.669
Maybe we should take
another deep breath.

17:29.310 --> 17:32.745
<i>So, here's what we know so far.</i>
<i>Okay, Ramish</i>

17:32.781 --> 17:34.347
claims to have been gardening

17:34.382 --> 17:36.616
and meditating the day
that Micah was killed.

17:36.651 --> 17:39.118
So he has motive
and no alibi.

17:39.154 --> 17:41.287
Unless he's got talking,
uh, tomatoes in his garden.

17:41.322 --> 17:43.556
Even if, it's unlikely

17:43.591 --> 17:46.325
a tomato's testimony
would hold up in court.

17:46.361 --> 17:47.860
That's a good one, Bones.
I like that.

17:47.896 --> 17:50.396
You're getting better at those.

17:52.367 --> 17:54.767
No. You know,
that's not our guy.

17:54.803 --> 17:56.803
Your gut?

17:56.838 --> 17:58.438
Yeah. It's all
we have right now.

18:01.342 --> 18:04.544
It's Max.
Max.

18:04.579 --> 18:06.579
Hi, Dad.

18:06.614 --> 18:09.382
Oh. It is?

18:09.417 --> 18:12.018
Oh, I completely
lost track of time.

18:12.053 --> 18:13.820
I-I'm... I'm
on my way now.

18:13.855 --> 18:15.588
Bye. It's after 10:00.

18:15.623 --> 18:17.290
What? No.

18:17.325 --> 18:19.192
Can't be. Whoa!
It's past 10:00.

18:19.227 --> 18:21.027
We've been here for two hours.

18:21.062 --> 18:23.396
That explains the
nasty looks we received

18:23.431 --> 18:24.931
from people who
wanted our table.

18:24.966 --> 18:27.133
Yeah. Can't eat pie fast,
or you'll cramp.

18:27.168 --> 18:29.268
That is a science.

18:31.639 --> 18:33.706
Some day I would love to live

18:33.741 --> 18:37.076
in a world governed
by your rules of physics.

18:37.111 --> 18:38.811
You will.

18:38.847 --> 18:41.581
Some day, you will.
Soon.<i> Very</i> soon.

18:45.635 --> 18:48.003
I have to get home.

18:48.038 --> 18:50.638
Right. Okay. Uh, look, okay,
I-I got the bill.

18:50.674 --> 18:53.274
Thanks. I'll see you back...

18:55.445 --> 18:58.847
I'll see you... tomorrow.

18:58.882 --> 19:01.583
See you tomorrow.

19:08.358 --> 19:11.559
<i>So, I was going</i>
<i>through the victim's tablet.</i>

19:11.594 --> 19:14.028
<i>He was using</i>

19:14.063 --> 19:15.496
a site called "Peek-a-Pic."

19:15.532 --> 19:17.698
It's a site where any photos
that he posts

19:17.734 --> 19:20.134
disappear after the person
that he sent them to

19:20.169 --> 19:21.502
viewed them.

19:21.538 --> 19:22.937
But if they've disappeared...

19:22.972 --> 19:24.505
No, they don't
actually disappear.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.909
The metadata is stored deep
within the file system, but

19:27.944 --> 19:30.311
if you know
how to get in there...

19:30.346 --> 19:33.881
All of these pictures
are of the same woman.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.883
Okay. Now,
that does not look

19:35.919 --> 19:37.351
like the victim's
girlfriend.

19:37.387 --> 19:41.389
No. This woman goes
by the username LizzyC.

19:41.424 --> 19:43.524
She's Elizabeth Collins.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.926
Apparently,
she's been a student of Micah's

19:44.961 --> 19:46.594
for about a year.

19:46.629 --> 19:48.763
Well, Ramish said that
Micah had so many clients

19:48.798 --> 19:51.799
because he took a real
hands-on approach with them.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.001
Now I know what he meant.

19:54.037 --> 19:55.536
Yeah.

19:58.652 --> 20:00.619
I can't believe it.

20:01.864 --> 20:03.230
Why would somebody kill Micah?

20:03.266 --> 20:05.266
Well, I was hoping
you could tell me.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.435
I have no idea.

20:07.470 --> 20:10.171
We found the Peek-a-Pic
photos, Elizabeth.

20:10.206 --> 20:13.007
We know that you two
were having an affair.

20:13.042 --> 20:15.343
Okay.

20:15.378 --> 20:16.811
I know what you're thinking.

20:16.846 --> 20:18.613
A young woman sleeping
with her yoga instructor--

20:18.648 --> 20:21.716
it's a total cliché--
but Micah was different.

20:21.751 --> 20:25.319
So, you didn't have to assault
him with a baseball bat?

20:25.355 --> 20:27.121
What?

20:27.156 --> 20:29.490
Your ex-boyfriend,
Dennis Eckland.

20:29.525 --> 20:31.359
Did you think we wouldn't
find out that you had a record?

20:31.394 --> 20:33.294
Those charges were dropped.

20:33.329 --> 20:35.336
And besides, that was
a long time ago.

20:35.360 --> 20:35.931
Oh, okay.

20:35.932 --> 20:37.565
So, I'll just forget
about the fact

20:37.600 --> 20:39.567
that you beat people
with baseball bats,

20:39.602 --> 20:41.102
and our victim looks to
have been beaten with a bat,

20:41.137 --> 20:42.503
because it was a long time ago.

20:42.538 --> 20:44.071
I didn't kill Micah!

20:44.107 --> 20:45.406
Maybe not intentionally,

20:45.441 --> 20:47.341
but we know
that you have anger issues.

20:47.377 --> 20:48.743
Not anymore.

20:48.778 --> 20:50.578
Micah taught me
breathing exercises

20:50.613 --> 20:52.647
and meditation techniques that...
That what?

20:52.682 --> 20:54.248
Made you have an affair
with him?

20:54.283 --> 20:56.017
Come on, Elizabeth.
What happened, huh?

20:56.052 --> 20:57.485
What, did he dump you,

20:57.520 --> 20:59.120
go back to
his girlfriend?

20:59.155 --> 21:00.621
No, it wasn't like that.

21:00.657 --> 21:02.456
Nan knew about me and Micah.

21:02.492 --> 21:05.493
Oh, so she was cool with you
sleeping with her boyfriend?

21:05.528 --> 21:08.362
Yes. They weren't
as possessive as you are.

21:08.398 --> 21:12.299
Micah and Nan had
an open relationship.

21:16.606 --> 21:19.840
<i>While going</i>
<i>through the injuries</i>

21:19.876 --> 21:21.475
caused by the
fire retardant,

21:21.511 --> 21:24.578
I noticed abundant
perimortem fracturing.

21:24.614 --> 21:26.681
Do you know
what caused the injuries?

21:26.716 --> 21:28.349
Well,

21:28.384 --> 21:31.886
since they are concentrated
on the right ulna, the radius,

21:31.921 --> 21:35.990
and the humerus,
and the left ulna and tibia,

21:36.025 --> 21:38.426
it suggests the victim was
in a struggle with his killer.

21:38.461 --> 21:39.994
Defensive wounds to his limbs.

21:40.029 --> 21:42.430
Booth should find out
if any of the suspects

21:42.465 --> 21:44.832
he's seen so far show
evidence of being in a fight.

21:44.867 --> 21:47.168
I'll let him know.
Well, actually,

21:47.203 --> 21:49.637
I can tell him.
Oh!

21:49.672 --> 21:50.805
I'm glad you two are feeling

21:50.840 --> 21:52.707
more comfortable
with each other.

21:52.742 --> 21:55.910
I know how hard Seeley's working
to make things right, so...

21:55.945 --> 21:57.678
Yes.

21:57.714 --> 21:59.847
His sponsor called this morning.

21:59.882 --> 22:02.616
He wanted to know
what flavor cake Booth wanted

22:02.652 --> 22:05.853
for his 30-day
sober celebration.

22:05.888 --> 22:07.121
Oh, that's wonderful.

22:07.156 --> 22:09.637
If you need to leave for it,
just say the word.

22:09.638 --> 22:11.660
Oh,
no, I wasn't invited.

22:11.694 --> 22:13.160
Oh.

22:13.196 --> 22:15.596
Should I have been?

22:15.631 --> 22:17.531
The first month is...

22:17.567 --> 22:19.934
a pretty significant hurdle.

22:19.969 --> 22:22.870
I just assumed...
It... Never mind.

22:22.905 --> 22:25.206
But if people traditionally
celebrate this milestone,

22:25.241 --> 22:28.175
why wouldn't Booth
want me there?

22:28.211 --> 22:30.978
I'm sure he has
a good reason. I didn't

22:31.013 --> 22:31.855
mean to...

22:31.879 --> 22:33.915
This has affected me
as much as it has Booth.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.117
Hey. So I swabbed the
damage to the victim's

22:36.152 --> 22:38.519
cheek and I found
traces of aluminum.

22:38.554 --> 22:41.756
So the victim was hit with an
aluminum cylindrical object?

22:41.791 --> 22:43.257
Yeah. A pipe

22:43.292 --> 22:45.693
or maybe an aluminum
baseball bat?

22:45.728 --> 22:48.696
Perhaps. But we still
need to find cause of death.

22:48.731 --> 22:50.998
Which means I need
to get back to work.

22:51.033 --> 22:52.867
I thought you were
gonna talk to Booth.

22:52.902 --> 22:54.201
Oh, you can do it.

22:54.237 --> 22:56.704
I'm too busy now.

23:03.679 --> 23:05.146
<i>So you and Micah</i>

23:05.181 --> 23:06.413
lived together,
that correct?

23:06.449 --> 23:07.882
For the past
three years.

23:07.917 --> 23:10.351
We started Sunrise Studios
in this very yard.

23:10.386 --> 23:12.753
Uh, we talked to one
of Micah's students.

23:12.789 --> 23:14.889
An Elizabeth Collins.
I knew

23:14.924 --> 23:16.323
all about Elizabeth.

23:16.359 --> 23:18.092
She and Micah were lovers.
So you

23:18.127 --> 23:20.494
and Micah did have
an open relationship?

23:20.530 --> 23:22.196
I know that open relationships
aren't for everyone,

23:22.231 --> 23:23.831
but it worked
for us.

23:23.866 --> 23:26.767
I can't believe that
Elizabeth would hurt Micah.

23:26.803 --> 23:29.203
Well, you see, Elizabeth--
she has an alibi, unlike you...

23:29.238 --> 23:30.471
I just told you,
Agent Booth,

23:30.506 --> 23:32.840
we weren't jealous
of each other.

23:32.875 --> 23:35.342
You had lovers, too?
Not as many. The last man

23:35.378 --> 23:37.645
that I was involved with was Danato.
Does

23:37.680 --> 23:39.980
Danato have a last name?
Vacaro.

23:40.016 --> 23:42.750
Danato Vacaro.
He's an artist.

23:42.785 --> 23:45.219
But we ended our arrangement
months ago.

23:45.254 --> 23:48.122
I'm sorry, w-why is that?
Danato...

23:48.157 --> 23:50.057
started to become
too attached emotionally.

23:50.092 --> 23:52.026
And so I told him
I had to concentrate

23:52.061 --> 23:54.922
on my relationship
with Micah for a while.

23:54.923 --> 23:57.065
And now Micah's dead.
So,

23:57.099 --> 23:58.833
you didn't think
to mention this earlier?

23:58.868 --> 24:00.668
Danato's a kind
and gentle soul.

24:00.703 --> 24:02.870
I guess I'm not as good as you
at thinking people are bad.

24:02.905 --> 24:04.672
You can think whatever you like
as long as you give us

24:04.707 --> 24:06.841
Danato's phone number.
That would be great.

24:08.811 --> 24:10.110
<i>What are you working on?</i>

24:10.146 --> 24:11.712
<i>I got some grass clippings,</i>

24:11.747 --> 24:13.480
dog poop, and...

24:13.516 --> 24:16.383
looks like a wad of
chewed-up watermelon gum.

24:16.419 --> 24:18.285
Sounds like stuff you'd
expect to find on the bottom

24:18.321 --> 24:21.689
of somebody's shoe.
Yes, it was all on the sandal. And

24:21.724 --> 24:24.225
this. This here's oil paint.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.694
Oh. Well, Booth
said the girlfriend

24:26.729 --> 24:30.464
recently split from her lover,
who happens to be an artist.

24:30.499 --> 24:32.868
Angie, what are you doing?
That's evidence.

24:32.869 --> 24:34.402
Yeah.
This paint is still rubbery.

24:34.437 --> 24:35.536
I'd say this is about two

24:35.571 --> 24:36.704
more days from curing.

24:36.739 --> 24:38.439
So oil paint has a cure time

24:38.474 --> 24:40.574
of between three and seven days.
So if this stuff

24:40.610 --> 24:42.977
still has two days to go
and our victim's been dead

24:43.012 --> 24:45.112
for the past five days...
It means he

24:45.147 --> 24:47.565
most likely stepped in this
paint on the day that he died.

24:47.566 --> 24:48.046
Wow.

24:48.050 --> 24:50.117
Doesn't look good for the
artist. All right, I'm gonna run

24:50.152 --> 24:52.720
the sample to
determine manufacturer.

24:52.755 --> 24:55.823
Hey, pretty nice meeting

24:55.858 --> 24:58.392
of forensic science
and art, there, Angie.

24:58.427 --> 25:01.128
Yeah. We make a great team.

25:01.163 --> 25:04.999
Yeah. Yeah,
you know what, we do.

25:05.034 --> 25:07.868
That's why I want
to give you this.

25:07.904 --> 25:11.038
Oh. Okay.

25:11.073 --> 25:12.706
Well, you've already
shown me this.

25:12.742 --> 25:14.174
Yes, I know,

25:14.210 --> 25:16.277
but now your dream
is a reality.

25:16.312 --> 25:19.046
Uh, what do you mean?

25:19.081 --> 25:20.381
I mean I bought it.

25:21.884 --> 25:23.584
It's ours.

25:24.987 --> 25:27.087
You... You did not.

25:27.123 --> 25:28.689
I did.

25:29.992 --> 25:31.525
Wha... Wait, why?

25:31.560 --> 25:33.727
Because you
seem ready.

25:33.763 --> 25:35.496
Hey.

25:35.531 --> 25:37.731
We've been here for
ten years, okay?

25:37.767 --> 25:39.433
We deserve to see
something new,

25:39.468 --> 25:42.236
to live a new life.

25:42.271 --> 25:43.704
You ready?

25:43.739 --> 25:45.139
Yes.

25:45.174 --> 25:48.375
Oh, my God. Yeah.

25:48.411 --> 25:49.977
Okay. Then no more talk.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.612
We're doing it.

25:51.647 --> 25:53.247
We are moving to Paris.

25:53.282 --> 25:55.482
Okay.

26:03.693 --> 26:05.492
Okay.

26:05.528 --> 26:08.362
Well, I see paintings
and easels inside.

26:08.397 --> 26:10.130
Looks like Danato
works from home.

26:10.166 --> 26:12.066
Which means our victim
could have been here

26:12.101 --> 26:14.301
on the day of his death.
Look, Cam said that Micah got into a fight

26:14.337 --> 26:16.770
with his killer, so keep an eye
out for injuries, will you?

26:19.842 --> 26:21.842
Think I may have
found a couple, Booth.

26:21.877 --> 26:23.744
You think?

26:27.888 --> 26:30.642
I'm sorry, but this news had
brought up a storm of emotions

26:30.643 --> 26:31.909
in within me.

26:31.944 --> 26:33.744
My heart pounds like thunder.

26:33.779 --> 26:35.712
You're a really passionate guy
there, aren't you, Danato?

26:35.748 --> 26:38.048
Maybe your passion is what
drove you to kill the man

26:38.083 --> 26:40.223
standing between you
and Nan Roselick.

26:40.247 --> 26:41.452
It is true,

26:41.453 --> 26:43.253
I envied what Micah
had for Nan.

26:43.289 --> 26:45.431
But he was a dear friend.
I would never hurt him.

26:45.432 --> 26:47.792
How do you explain the bruises?
Stumbling back home from

26:47.826 --> 26:50.227
a bar last week, I fell
down a set of subway stairs.

26:50.262 --> 26:53.630
I was kissing the
pavement, as you say.

26:53.666 --> 26:56.833
I see you use Edgarton oil paint.
Yes, it is

26:56.869 --> 26:58.635
the best, in my opinion.
It's the best?

26:58.671 --> 27:00.604
The same paint we found
on Micah's shoe.

27:00.639 --> 27:02.206
Which means
Micah was here

27:02.241 --> 27:04.241
the day he was killed.

27:04.276 --> 27:07.778
Micah heard about the accident.
He came by my place

27:07.813 --> 27:09.813
to show me a couple
of yoga poses

27:09.848 --> 27:11.949
to help me ease my pain.
So you two

27:11.984 --> 27:14.496
just did a little yoga
and he left, huh?

27:14.519 --> 27:15.253
No,

27:15.254 --> 27:18.021
Micah left before
we got started.

27:18.057 --> 27:19.456
He received a phone call

27:19.491 --> 27:21.325
and he had to rush out.
Any idea

27:21.360 --> 27:23.126
where this call came from?
No. all I heard

27:23.162 --> 27:24.695
is Micah on the phone
saying that he

27:24.730 --> 27:26.663
could be there
in two to three minutes.

27:26.699 --> 27:29.433
Then he climbed on his
bicycle and he took off.

27:29.468 --> 27:31.101
You have no idea
where he was going?

27:31.136 --> 27:34.204
I'm sorry. I wish
I could be more help.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.708
I want to bring justice
for my friend.

27:41.647 --> 27:44.047
<i>Hey.</i>

27:44.083 --> 27:45.215
You have a minute?

27:45.251 --> 27:46.717
I believe I have

27:46.752 --> 27:48.819
multiple minutes, actually.

27:48.854 --> 27:50.988
Okay. Um...

27:53.692 --> 27:57.361
So, I have some good news.

27:57.396 --> 28:00.764
Then why did you say it
as if it were bad news?

28:00.799 --> 28:03.200
'Cause some parts of it
might not be so good.

28:03.235 --> 28:05.535
I'm not
understanding this.

28:05.571 --> 28:09.006
Is it possible for you
to be more direct?

28:10.242 --> 28:13.910
Hodgins and I are
planning to move to Paris.

28:15.614 --> 28:17.714
France.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.916
Paris, France.

28:19.952 --> 28:22.786
I'm-I'm familiar with Paris.

28:22.821 --> 28:24.955
I-I don't have to
do it now, though.

28:24.990 --> 28:26.623
I mean, not if you need me.

28:26.659 --> 28:29.693
I-I know how tough things
have been for you and Booth.

28:29.728 --> 28:32.162
No, we're fine.

28:32.197 --> 28:34.931
We're going to be fine.

28:34.967 --> 28:36.833
But I-I don't understand.

28:36.869 --> 28:39.303
Why would you want
to move there?

28:40.673 --> 28:43.573
Well, because
it's Paris, sweetie.

28:43.609 --> 28:45.542
I-I mean, I-I've always
wanted to live there.

28:45.577 --> 28:48.712
But you have a career here.

28:48.747 --> 28:51.481
This... This was always
a temporary thing for me.

28:51.517 --> 28:53.483
You know that. I...

28:53.519 --> 28:56.153
I mean, I've already
been here much longer

28:56.188 --> 28:59.156
than I thought I would be.

29:00.092 --> 29:02.993
But you have friends here.

29:03.028 --> 29:04.761
Yeah.

29:04.797 --> 29:06.596
That's the tough part.

29:06.632 --> 29:09.433
You, mostly.

29:09.468 --> 29:11.968
Everything you know is here.

29:12.004 --> 29:13.537
Yeah, but
that's just it.

29:13.572 --> 29:16.173
I don't want to know
everything in my life.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.475
I want to be surprised.

29:18.510 --> 29:20.510
Don't you?

29:20.546 --> 29:22.646
I do.

29:22.681 --> 29:26.116
I never thought
I'd be here this long, either.

29:28.153 --> 29:31.088
Are you mad?

29:31.123 --> 29:33.990
No.

29:34.026 --> 29:35.992
No, I'm...

29:36.028 --> 29:38.195
I'm really happy
for you, Angela.

29:41.700 --> 29:45.502
If you need me,
I'll just be a plane ride away.

29:47.072 --> 29:48.805
I'm gonna miss you, Brennan.

29:56.281 --> 29:58.014
Have you found
cause of death, Mr. Bray?

29:58.050 --> 29:59.716
I believe I have.
I was just about

29:59.752 --> 30:01.585
to do a victory lap
around the light table.

30:01.620 --> 30:05.255
A tiny nick on the distal end
of the left femur.

30:05.290 --> 30:07.791
In order for a weapon
to have caused this injury, it

30:07.826 --> 30:10.360
would have had to transect
the femoral artery first.

30:10.396 --> 30:12.295
Causing the victim
to bleed out.

30:12.331 --> 30:14.197
And the Brayman
has cause of death.

30:14.233 --> 30:15.532
Take it down a notch,

30:15.567 --> 30:17.000
Mr. Bray, this
isn't the end zone.

30:17.035 --> 30:18.635
Have you figured out
what caused the injury?

30:18.670 --> 30:21.171
A very wide
V-shaped incision,

30:21.206 --> 30:24.074
meaning the weapon was
most likely a wide-angle blade.

30:24.109 --> 30:25.709
There are similar nicks

30:25.744 --> 30:27.978
to the left side ribs
five and six,

30:28.013 --> 30:31.014
as well as the
right humerus.

30:31.049 --> 30:33.483
The width of that kerf mark
is a lot narrower than

30:33.519 --> 30:35.819
the incision on the femur.
Yes. And the dimensions

30:35.854 --> 30:37.387
of the incision
on the humerus are

30:37.423 --> 30:40.390
different than the incisions
on the ribs and femur.

30:40.426 --> 30:41.792
Meaning our victim
could have been stabbed

30:41.827 --> 30:43.393
with three separate blades.

30:44.763 --> 30:46.997
<i>So the artist was telling</i>

30:47.032 --> 30:49.599
the truth. Micah received
a call before he ran out,

30:49.635 --> 30:51.368
but it was from
a burner cell.

30:51.403 --> 30:53.837
Meaning we have no idea
where Micah was going

30:53.872 --> 30:55.272
or who he was
meeting with.

30:55.307 --> 30:57.307
And the fact that it was
from a burner cell

30:57.342 --> 30:59.409
just makes it all
the more suspicious.

30:59.445 --> 31:02.212
Okay, well, this is the area
surrounding the artist's place.

31:02.247 --> 31:04.414
Okay. The victim said that
he could get to wherever

31:04.450 --> 31:06.283
he was going in two
to three minutes.

31:06.318 --> 31:08.051
Oh, that's good.

31:08.086 --> 31:10.487
Really? There's got to be
hundreds of homes and businesses

31:10.522 --> 31:12.189
in Adams Morgan.

31:12.224 --> 31:14.891
That neighborhood is crawling
with young people

31:14.927 --> 31:17.127
who are all using
social media.

31:17.162 --> 31:19.296
All I have to do
is run a search of all photos

31:19.331 --> 31:21.298
taken in that area
during the time

31:21.333 --> 31:23.900
we know Micah was there.

31:23.936 --> 31:26.436
Whoa. Looks like
we got some pictures

31:26.472 --> 31:28.438
to go through.
Well, not if I can run

31:28.474 --> 31:31.575
a facial recognition program
against them to find Micah.

31:38.183 --> 31:40.717
Oh, oh!
There he is, look.

31:40.752 --> 31:44.120
Walking into a bar called Nat's Place.
Now I

31:44.156 --> 31:46.957
just have to figure out
who he was meeting there.

31:50.362 --> 31:52.062
It's been a real pleasure

31:52.097 --> 31:54.164
being able to go down
this journey with you, Seeley.

31:54.199 --> 31:56.066
Thanks, Gavin.
You're a class act

31:56.101 --> 31:58.435
and you're a true
representation of everything

31:58.470 --> 32:00.470
this group strives for.

32:00.506 --> 32:02.806
So it's with great pride

32:02.841 --> 32:04.474
that I finally
get to announce

32:04.510 --> 32:07.844
that Seeley Booth
is 30 days sober.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.113
All right, thanks.
Thank you, thank you. Great job, man.

32:10.148 --> 32:11.615
- Thanks, Gavin, I appreciate it.
- Well done.

32:11.650 --> 32:13.283
That's right.

32:14.853 --> 32:16.887
Look, I just wanted to say I...
I couldn't have

32:16.922 --> 32:18.488
done it without
the help of everyone

32:18.524 --> 32:19.923
in this room.

32:19.958 --> 32:22.025
I get kind of nervous
at things like this,

32:22.060 --> 32:24.427
so, um...

32:33.705 --> 32:36.439
Thank you.

32:36.475 --> 32:38.875
All right, folks, what do you
say we stuff ourselves silly

32:38.911 --> 32:40.977
with cake and burnt coffee?

32:41.013 --> 32:44.848
Yeah.

32:46.552 --> 32:48.018
Okay.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.452
Bones, what are you
doing here?

32:49.488 --> 32:51.655
Dr. Hodgins found
traces of glass

32:51.690 --> 32:53.056
in the victim's
stab wounds.

32:53.091 --> 32:55.659
So it wasn't different knives.
No.

32:55.694 --> 32:57.127
There were three
different shards of glass.

32:57.162 --> 32:59.663
The victim was most likely
pushed through a window.

32:59.698 --> 33:02.165
Okay. Well, you didn't have
to come here to tell me that.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.035
Why didn't you
want me here, Booth?

33:07.039 --> 33:09.172
Uh...

33:12.010 --> 33:14.044
It's not a big deal.
It really isn't.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.713
I mean, look, this is just
an excuse for Gavin to eat cake.

33:16.748 --> 33:18.248
It is
a big deal, Booth.

33:18.283 --> 33:19.816
You've worked really hard
for this.

33:19.851 --> 33:22.852
You didn't want me to...
celebrate with you?

33:22.888 --> 33:24.654
No. It's just...
I just feel like I have

33:24.690 --> 33:28.858
a really long way to go. That's all.
No, Booth.

33:28.894 --> 33:31.494
<i>We</i> still have a long way to go.

33:33.231 --> 33:36.633
Which means I share
this challenge with you.

33:36.668 --> 33:41.705
And I would like to share
in your victory, too.

33:46.345 --> 33:49.779
Wait... That's Aubrey. Hold on.

33:49.815 --> 33:51.815
Aubrey, what do you got?

33:51.850 --> 33:53.617
I just got off the phone
with the bartender

33:53.652 --> 33:55.785
down at Nat's Place.

33:55.821 --> 33:56.987
Does he remember seeing
the victim?

33:57.022 --> 33:58.542
Well, guys trying
to order carrot juice

33:58.557 --> 34:00.190
at a bar tend to stick out.

34:00.225 --> 34:01.958
And the person he was meeting?

34:01.994 --> 34:05.662
A big, bald biker fitting the
description of one Dale Brock.

34:05.697 --> 34:07.631
Wait a second.
Brock said he hadn't seen Micah

34:07.666 --> 34:09.331
for five years.

34:09.368 --> 34:12.936
Clearly this guy isn't
as trustworthy as he looks.

34:16.375 --> 34:18.842
<i>You lied to me, Dale. You were</i>

34:18.877 --> 34:20.079
with Micah the day he died.

34:20.103 --> 34:21.779
I don't know who told
you that, but it's crap.

34:21.780 --> 34:25.248
Really? Okay, so this bar named,
uh, Nat's Place,

34:25.283 --> 34:27.684
does that ring a bell?
Yeah, I thought so.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.085
You want to tell me what
happened before I throw your ass

34:30.121 --> 34:31.920
back in jail?
Look,

34:31.956 --> 34:33.922
one of the terms of my parole
is I'm not allowed

34:33.958 --> 34:35.891
to have contact with any other felons.
Okay, so you're telling me

34:35.927 --> 34:38.328
that if you told me you saw him,
you'd be thrown back in prison.

34:38.362 --> 34:39.007
Yeah.

34:39.031 --> 34:40.664
Okay. Well, news flash.
Let's just be clear

34:40.666 --> 34:42.232
about all this stuff,
because, you know what,

34:42.266 --> 34:43.833
murder is a violation
of your parole.

34:43.869 --> 34:46.202
I didn't kill him.

34:46.237 --> 34:47.570
I met him to ask for a favor.

34:47.606 --> 34:49.272
What, for free yoga classes?
Money for my kids.

34:49.306 --> 34:51.641
When I was doing time, my...

34:51.677 --> 34:53.543
child support bill kept piling
up. But when I got out,

34:53.578 --> 34:55.679
I was down 20 large.
So you expected him

34:55.714 --> 34:58.778
to give you 20 grand because
you bought him carrot juice.

34:58.802 --> 34:59.984
Not all of it.

34:59.985 --> 35:02.585
But he said he understood and
that he could get me the money.

35:02.621 --> 35:04.788
I don't know where he was gonna
get that kind of green, but...

35:04.823 --> 35:06.990
he told me to stay at the bar
and he'd be back.

35:07.025 --> 35:08.958
Then what happened?
He never showed.

35:08.994 --> 35:11.361
I waited for hours
and I finally gave up.

35:11.396 --> 35:14.831
And when you told me he died,
I...

35:14.866 --> 35:17.934
I figured someone offed him
for the money.

35:17.969 --> 35:19.936
That's a reasonable explanation.
It's also reasonable

35:19.971 --> 35:22.372
that you did it.

35:28.155 --> 35:30.569
If the victim had been pushed
through a window,

35:30.570 --> 35:32.603
it would also explain
the injuries

35:32.639 --> 35:34.372
to the rest of his remains.

35:34.407 --> 35:37.708
The fracturing we thought
was caused by an aluminum weapon

35:37.744 --> 35:40.011
could have been caused
by an aluminum window frame.

35:40.046 --> 35:41.979
Yeah, but he must have been
pushed through the window

35:42.016 --> 35:43.883
with a great deal of force
to be able to sustain

35:43.884 --> 35:44.935
those kinds of injuries.

35:44.959 --> 35:47.205
Maybe you could recreate
a possible scenario.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.288
Okay.

35:50.323 --> 35:54.792
Huh. Okay. For the scenario
to be correct,

35:54.827 --> 35:57.094
he would have had to have been
pushed through a window

35:57.130 --> 35:59.730
measuring two feet
by four feet.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.033
Odd shape.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.

36:02.068 --> 36:05.937
The parietal. The victim was
holding the back of his head

36:05.972 --> 36:08.439
when he hit the glass.

36:10.243 --> 36:13.010
<i>The killer must have delivered</i>

36:13.046 --> 36:14.879
a blow to the back
of the victim's head

36:14.914 --> 36:17.281
to propel him into the glass.

36:17.317 --> 36:18.883
Meaning there should be
evidence of the blow.

36:18.918 --> 36:21.218
I think I found something.

36:21.254 --> 36:23.754
There appears to be a
slight depression fracture

36:23.790 --> 36:25.556
that was obscured
by the fire damage.

36:25.592 --> 36:27.558
Based on the dimensions,
this injury was created

36:27.594 --> 36:29.226
by the corner
of a blunt instrument.

36:29.262 --> 36:31.128
I'll ask Dr. Hodgins to
swab the wound for trace.

36:31.164 --> 36:34.332
Whatever caused this wound is
what drove him into the glass.

36:34.367 --> 36:37.268
Glass?
You don't think it was a window?

36:37.303 --> 36:39.003
I have no evidence
to support my suspicion.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.505
Are you seriously telling me

36:40.506 --> 36:42.039
you're going on your gut?

36:42.075 --> 36:45.843
I don't recall saying anything
of the sort.

36:47.647 --> 36:49.447
<i>I just looked back over</i>

36:49.482 --> 36:51.415
the victim's finances.
Micah had the 20 grand,

36:51.451 --> 36:54.285
but that was pretty much his
and Nan's entire savings.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.920
So the money
was pooled.

36:55.955 --> 36:58.389
Even though they-they weren't married.
Yeah.

36:58.424 --> 37:00.157
Because they weren't possessive
like us,

37:00.193 --> 37:01.525
I guess is what they'd say.

37:01.561 --> 37:03.294
Micah can't say anything
anymore.

37:05.164 --> 37:09.834
Hodgins found traces of Tibetan
bamboo in the victim's skull.

37:09.869 --> 37:12.536
Tibetan bamboo.

37:12.572 --> 37:15.272
Tibetan bamboo. W-Wait.

37:15.308 --> 37:17.408
The tablets at Nan's studio.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.343
Bones even said
she didn't think

37:19.379 --> 37:21.078
that he was pushed
out the window.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.414
Based on what?
Her gut, I think.

37:23.415 --> 37:23.942
Wow.

37:23.943 --> 37:25.943
Yeah, but do you remember?
The lawn furniture.

37:26.386 --> 37:29.320
It was made out of, uh, glass.
At Nan's place.

37:29.355 --> 37:30.888
Outside. In the
back there. Remember?

37:30.923 --> 37:33.190
And the-the legs were
all made out of aluminum.

37:33.226 --> 37:35.259
Damn, you're right. There should
have been a coffee table

37:35.294 --> 37:36.627
in that set.

37:36.663 --> 37:38.729
Which would have measured
four by two.

37:38.765 --> 37:40.698
<i>Micah was my world.</i>

37:40.733 --> 37:42.833
He was the most sensitive,
compassionate man that I knew.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.468
Why would I kill him?

37:44.504 --> 37:47.738
For the same reason you
just cited, his compassion.

37:47.774 --> 37:49.707
You see, he wanted to give your
savings away to help a friend.

37:49.742 --> 37:51.676
And you weren't too happy about that.
So you hit him

37:51.711 --> 37:53.044
with your tablet

37:53.079 --> 37:55.513
and knocked him
into the glass coffee table.

37:55.548 --> 37:57.014
That's just simply not true.
I don't know

37:57.050 --> 37:58.650
why you would think that.
But in addition

37:58.685 --> 38:02.787
to dumping the body, you also
disposed of your tablet.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.755
Which must have
seemed smart to you,

38:04.791 --> 38:07.291
since the repeated
blows to his head

38:07.326 --> 38:10.161
caused your tablet
to start recording.

38:10.196 --> 38:12.830
See, our people got all the
footage from your cloud account.

38:12.865 --> 38:15.800
Now, I want you to watch this.
Wait for it. Here it comes.

38:18.404 --> 38:21.305
Micah. I'm-I'm so sorry.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.741
Micah. Oh, my God. Micah.

38:23.776 --> 38:26.043
Micah. Oh, my God.
Micah!

38:28.648 --> 38:30.881
We worked

38:30.917 --> 38:33.751
so hard for that money.

38:33.786 --> 38:36.269
He was just gonna give it away
to some criminal.

38:36.293 --> 38:38.293
No.

38:39.292 --> 38:43.461
He was going to help a friend
rebuild his life.

39:33.012 --> 39:34.378
Pookie.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.614
None for you.

39:36.649 --> 39:39.283
Come on. Never again.

39:40.553 --> 39:43.420
Well, rarely again.

39:45.191 --> 39:48.793
Thank you, Angie.

39:52.532 --> 39:56.500
I'm gonna miss
this place, Ange.

39:58.337 --> 40:01.605
You know, Paris
isn't going anywhere.

40:01.641 --> 40:04.675
If you're not
feeling ready.

40:04.710 --> 40:07.745
No. No. It's just...
it's just a big change.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.513
It's not bad.

40:09.549 --> 40:11.515
Yeah.

40:11.551 --> 40:14.285
To change.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.254
To change.

40:17.290 --> 40:20.658
Hey. Sorry. I had to finish
up a bit of paperwork.

40:20.693 --> 40:22.993
What is it
you two wanted to see me about?

40:23.029 --> 40:26.197
Yeah. Here goes.

40:26.232 --> 40:29.466
Maybe you should have
a beaker of wine first.

40:31.370 --> 40:35.072
So, you know how I've always
talked about living in Paris?

40:43.549 --> 40:46.350
Look at that, huh?
"So there."

40:46.385 --> 40:48.485
And sweet dreams.

40:48.521 --> 40:51.255
One more story.

40:51.290 --> 40:52.110
Please?

40:52.111 --> 40:53.910
Daddy has read
you five books.

40:53.946 --> 40:55.779
It's time for
bed, sweetheart.

40:55.814 --> 40:57.881
Will you come over
to play with me tomorrow?

40:57.916 --> 40:59.497
Of course I'm gonna come
play with you tomorrow.

40:59.521 --> 41:00.351
Come on, let's go.

41:00.352 --> 41:02.886
Jump off the couch. Run,
little monster. Run to the bed.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.588
Jump in under those covers.
I'll tell you what,

41:04.623 --> 41:06.456
I'll give you a kiss
right before I leave.

41:06.492 --> 41:10.627
Don't forget to
brush your teeth.

41:10.662 --> 41:14.131
Listen, uh, Bones,
I was thinking

41:14.166 --> 41:16.466
that maybe I could come by, um,

41:16.502 --> 41:19.035
next week, uh, you know,
maybe a couple mornings

41:19.071 --> 41:20.637
and take her to school.

41:25.577 --> 41:28.945
Look, if we're not there yet...
In my mind, I...

41:28.981 --> 41:31.381
I know that you being out
of the house is working.

41:31.416 --> 41:33.817
It's what motivates you.

41:33.852 --> 41:37.120
It's one of the things, yeah.

41:37.156 --> 41:41.391
What's gonna keep you going
when you move back?

41:41.426 --> 41:46.596
Knowing I don't have a second
chance if I screw up again.

41:46.632 --> 41:51.902
The rational side of me needs
to know that that is true.

41:51.937 --> 41:54.404
Empirically.

41:54.439 --> 41:58.041
But statistically
that's impossible.

41:58.076 --> 42:01.878
Life is essentially uncertain.

42:02.848 --> 42:04.581
No guarantees.

42:04.616 --> 42:07.150
That's right.

42:09.555 --> 42:13.323
And if we try to be certain
before we act, we...

42:13.358 --> 42:15.926
may never act.

42:15.961 --> 42:18.828
What... So what are you saying,
Bones?

42:22.100 --> 42:26.069
I'm saying...

42:26.104 --> 42:29.873
I have faith in you, Booth.

42:32.477 --> 42:35.645
And I...

42:35.681 --> 42:39.883
think you should stay the night
with me.

42:43.670 --> 42:47.004
I think I should, too.

42:59.676 --> 43:06.176
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

43:35.068 --> 43:36.668
What's that mean?
