WEBVTT

00:16.050 --> 00:17.051
( children playing )

01:04.864 --> 01:05.866
( laughing )

02:25.846 --> 02:28.582
Nealon: WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
MY SEAT, MRS. KELLOGG?

02:28.649 --> 02:29.683
RIGHT HERE?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.151
YES.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.489
IF IT'S TOO COLD FOR YOU,
MRS. KELLOGG

02:35.556 --> 02:36.757
WE'LL CLOSE THE WINDOW.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.459
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.222
Woods: READY?

03:11.492 --> 03:13.461
LET'S GET STARTED.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.663
WE'RE HERE SPEAKING
WITH CYNTHIA KELLOGG

03:15.729 --> 03:20.634
WHO HAS COME FORWARD
VOLUNTARILY TO
GIVE INFORMATION

03:20.701 --> 03:22.936
IN THE CASE REGARDING
JAMES URBANSKI.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.274
IN ATTENDANCE ARE
DETECTIVE JOHN WOODS

03:26.340 --> 03:28.909
AND MYSELF,
DETECTIVE LINDA NEALON.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.780
I HAVE TO INFORM YOU
OF YOUR RIGHTS.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.916
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.151
IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT,
ANYTHING YOU SAY

03:38.218 --> 03:41.355
CAN AND WILL BE USED
AGAINST YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.223
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
THE PRESENCE OF AN ATTORNEY.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.726
I DON'T NEED AN ATTORNEY.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.228
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT
I SHOULD NEED AN ATTORNEY.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.431
Nealon: THIS IS YOUR RIGHT.

03:50.498 --> 03:55.002
IF AT ANY TIME YOU WISH
TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY PRESENT

03:55.068 --> 03:56.537
YOU MAY.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.539
I'M JUST ANXIOUS
TO GET ON WITH THIS.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.974
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING I'VE SAID TO YOU?

04:01.041 --> 04:02.643
YES, I DO.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.979
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU
NOTICED PROBLEMS OR TENSION

04:06.046 --> 04:07.748
IN THE URBANSKI MARRIAGE?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.883
THAT I CAN REMEMBER...

04:12.920 --> 04:14.355
THE WEDDING.

04:24.465 --> 04:28.336
( band playing
Italian folk music )

04:40.213 --> 04:43.417
THAT'S GOOD, FELLAS.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.453
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

04:45.519 --> 04:47.054
HOW ARE YOU?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.089
HEY, DOMINIC.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.759
HOW ARE YOU?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.494
NICE TO SEE YOU.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.064
CONGRATULATIONS, DOM.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.268
HARRY,
YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.337
HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:07.441 --> 05:10.043
GIVE US A COUPLE MORE DRINKS
HERE, BOB.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.545
COMING UP.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.984
I WAS MORE NERVOUS
THAN I THOUGHT I'D BE.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.286
I FORGOT TO DO MY LEFT HAND.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.854
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR GLOVES ON.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.524
I MESSED UP THOSE WORDS
DURING THE CEREMONY.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.125
EVERYONE MESSES UP.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.760
REMEMBER MY WEDDING?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.195
I FORGOT EVERYTHING.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.164
YOUR WEDDING WAS GREAT,
EXCEPT YOUR HUSBAND
IS SUCH A...

05:31.231 --> 05:33.834
WHAT GROOM SELLS TOOLS
AT HIS OWN WEDDING?

05:33.901 --> 05:35.736
LET ME GET MY COMB.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.438
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE QUICKLY.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.072
THE CONDO IS THE FUTURE.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.208
IF YOU WANT TO GO CO-OP,
I CAN HELP WITH THAT TOO.

05:41.274 --> 05:42.776
I COULD NEVER TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

05:42.843 --> 05:47.247
WITH A CONDO,
YOU OWN OUTRIGHT.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.949
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.418
WHAT?

05:50.484 --> 05:51.885
EXCUSE ME.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.787
I NEED THE PURSE.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.723
DO YOU HAVE
TO TALK BUSINESS?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.758
I MEAN,
THIS IS A WEDDING.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.560
CYNTHIA, THAT'S THE BEST TIME.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.094
SOCIAL OCCASIONS.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.796
HOW DO YOU THINK
PEOPLE GET RICH?

06:02.863 --> 06:03.964
RICH?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.098
THAT'S JOYCE'S COUSIN, BOBBY.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.167
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.239
DOMINIC, THE PURSE.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.541
THANKS, HON.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.842
I'M GOING TO CHECK
WITH THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.810
OKAY.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.646
ANGIE.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.782
Photographer:
LET'S HAVE A GROUP SHOT
OF THE BRIDESMAIDS.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.951
JUST THE BRIDESMAIDS, PLEASE.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.987
JOYCE, COME HERE.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.422
COME HERE.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.725
WHAT?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.061
WHERE'S THE PURSE?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.429
I GAVE IT TO MY FATHER.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.197
SINCE WHEN DO YOU TRUST
YOUR FATHER?

06:37.264 --> 06:39.967
HE PAID FOR
THE FUCKING WEDDING.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.301
GO GET THE PURSE.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.369
NO.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.704
GO GET THE PURSE!

06:43.771 --> 06:45.539
MY SISTER PAID
FOR THIS DRESS.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.907
COME ON, IT'S FAMILY.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.542
WHOSE FAMILY YOU IN?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.478
GET OUT OF HERE,
BONEHEAD.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.145
WHO INVITED YOU, ANYWAY?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.882
I'M TELLING YOU NICELY,
GO GET THE PURSE.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.617
THEY'RE LOWLIFES.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.352
THEY EMBARRASSED YOU,
THEY EMBARRASSED ME.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.955
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WHOLE
FUCKING LIFE TO FIGHT.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.290
LET'S GET A DRINK.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.459
GET ME A V.O. AND SODA.

07:08.361 --> 07:09.463
DADDY.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.731
HIYA, HON,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.199
GIVE ME THE PURSE.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.266
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.470
HE'S GOING TO BREAK MY NECK.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.638
GIVE ME THE PURSE.

07:17.705 --> 07:18.906
HE'LL BREAK YOUR NECK?

07:18.972 --> 07:20.808
JUST RELAX, DADDY.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.111
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, ANYWAY.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.649
CUT, CUT, CUT.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.189
THERE'S
THE FUCKING PURSE.
YOU HAPPY NOW?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.658
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.293
WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW
WHAT WAS OR WASN'T IN THERE.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.862
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:41.929 --> 07:43.597
YOUR FATHER'S
BEEN DRINKING SINCE 10:00.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.698
BIG FUCKING DEAL.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.099
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.269
YOU DON'T TRUST
MY FUCKING FATHER.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.704
Bandleader:
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

07:50.771 --> 07:54.107
DANCING FOR THE FIRST TIME
AS HUSBAND AND WIFE

07:54.174 --> 07:57.344
MR. JAMES URBANSKI
AND HIS LOVELY BRIDE, JOYCE.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.347
EVERYBODY'S STARING AT US.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.716
Man:
CONGRATULATIONS.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.818
Man:
NEVER LET HER GO.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.922
Joyce:
WHAT?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.724
I DON'T HEAR YOU.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.359
I SAID, I'M SORRY,
ALL RIGHT?

08:12.425 --> 08:14.928
COME ON OVER HERE,
AND I'LL BITE YOUR HAND.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.832
I PRESENT TO YOU
MR. AND MRS. JAMES URBANSKI.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.906
* DON'T GO CHANGING

08:25.973 --> 08:29.677
* TO TRY AND PLEASE ME

08:29.743 --> 08:34.847
* YOU NEVER LET ME
DOWN BEFORE

08:34.914 --> 08:37.618
* HMM HMM HMM

08:37.684 --> 08:39.519
* AND DON'T IMAGINE

08:41.354 --> 08:45.058
* YOU'RE TOO FAMILIAR...

08:46.459 --> 08:49.429
I GUESS THEY DRIFTED APART
FROM THERE.

08:49.496 --> 08:52.499
I CAN'T SEE WHY THEY BOTHERED.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.803
JOYCE JUMPED AT THE CHANCE
TO MARRY JIMMY.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.806
IN HER MIND,
HE WAS A VERY GOOD CATCH.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.574
AND AFTER THE WEDDING

09:00.641 --> 09:03.243
JOYCE CONTINUED TO CONFIDE
IN YOU ABOUT HER PROBLEMS?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.646
YEAH, SHE DID.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.348
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT SOME
OF HER COMPLAINTS WERE?

09:12.185 --> 09:14.454
HE COMES AND GOES
AS HE PLEASES.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.056
HIGH ALL THE TIME.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.825
HE WAS A HEAVY DRUG USER.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.093
THIS WAS A SORE POINT
WITH JOYCE.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.363
WELL, NOT AT FIRST,
BUT HE NEVER CAME AROUND

09:23.430 --> 09:25.833
AND THEN HE WOULD
JUST LOSE IT.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.336
Nealon: WHAT DO YOU MEAN--
EXACTLY?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.238
WELL, HE WOULD...

09:31.304 --> 09:33.306
HE WOULD LIKE
PULL A KNIFE ON HER

09:33.373 --> 09:35.042
AND CHASE HER AROUND THE ROOM.

09:36.677 --> 09:40.113
PUNCHED HER SO HARD ONCE,
PUT HER IN THE HOSPITAL.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.150
WHEN IS THE FIRST TIME

09:43.216 --> 09:46.319
JOYCE SAID SHE WANTED
TO GET RID OF HER HUSBAND?

09:48.756 --> 09:52.492
UH... I REMEMBER A TIME...

09:52.559 --> 09:54.561
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT WAS THE FIRST TIME.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.872
WHEN THIS IS ALL BLONDE,
IT'S GOING TO BE GORGEOUS.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.206
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.507
CYNTHIA, I'LL DO HER.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.177
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO STAY OFF YOUR FEET.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.280
I KNOW MY LIMIT.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.648
I DON'T WANT YOU
POPPING YOUR TOAST

10:14.715 --> 10:16.283
WHEN WE GOT A STORE FULL
OF CUSTOMERS.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.985
WHERE THE HELL IS COOKIE?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.756
Joyce:
COOKIE, I'LL BRAIN YOU.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.193
I SWEAR, I WAS STUCK
IN THE TUNNEL FOR AN HOUR.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.862
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.231
WHAT, DID YOU SWALLOW
A HAND GRENADE?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.234
JOYCE, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING ANYMORE.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.706
WE'RE GOING TO
SEE YOUR MOTHER.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.109
HEY, JOYCE,
TAKE THE BABY.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.677
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO WATCH HIM.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.112
I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.546
YOU SHOOTING HOOPS?

10:46.613 --> 10:48.982
MAYBE THAT'S WHY I GOT
TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.818
WHAT IS THIS?

10:50.884 --> 10:52.119
WE RAN OUT OF PAMPERS.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.186
WHAT, ARE YOU CRIPPLED?

10:53.253 --> 10:54.254
GO BUY SOME.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.189
NO, IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.859
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.293
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.695
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:02.963 --> 11:05.132
WHAT?

11:05.198 --> 11:06.800
OH, GREAT, JOYCE.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.468
CYNTHIA,
COULD YOU HOLD HIM?

11:08.535 --> 11:09.770
REALLY FUCKING SMART.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.139
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:12.205 --> 11:16.176
THAT WAS
YOUR SECOND APPOINTMENT.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.478
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF
ALL THESE CUSTOMERS?

11:18.545 --> 11:20.347
FUCK THESE CUSTOMERS.
WHO GIVES A FUCK
ABOUT THEM?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.653
YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF THIS

11:26.720 --> 11:29.189
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
ANOTHER BABY AROUND HERE.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.590
WHAT IF I WANT
ANOTHER BABY?

11:30.657 --> 11:31.725
NO!

11:31.792 --> 11:33.560
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.228
YOU GET THIS
TAKEN CARE OF.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.596
FUCK YOU, JAMES!

11:36.663 --> 11:39.066
FUCK ME, HUH?

11:40.567 --> 11:42.135
SHIT.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.971
HEY, HEY, JIMMY, JIMMY.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.205
WHAT?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.340
COME ON.
THIS IS NOT THE TIME...

11:47.407 --> 11:50.610
CYNTHIA, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT INSPIRED THIS SHIT,
ANYWAY.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.045
WHY DON'T YOU GO
CUT SOME HAIR?

11:52.112 --> 11:53.513
GO.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.316
BYE-BYE.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.655
I'M TELLING YOU, JOYCE.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.625
LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.962
YOU GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.798
END OF CONVERSATION.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.967
GET OUT OF HERE, JAMES.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.813
COOKIE, WHO FUCKED
YOUR HAIR UP?

12:27.147 --> 12:29.049
JUST LEAVE US ENOUGH
FOR CHANGE, ALL RIGHT?

12:45.432 --> 12:46.666
JOYCE, YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:46.733 --> 12:47.767
NO.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.836
WHAT, HE HURT YOU?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.370
YEAH.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.073
JOYCE, THERE WERE A LOT
OF TIPS IN THE REGISTER.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.576
COOKIE, I'M GOING TO RIP
THAT HAIR OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.112
I'M GOING TO KILL HIM
ONE OF THESE DAYS.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.949
YOU WANT HALF THE BUSINESS?
JUST KILL HIM FOR ME.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.251
Cynthia: SHE SAID, "YOU WANT
HALF THE BUSINESS,

13:04.317 --> 13:06.419
"JUST KILL HIM FOR ME."

13:06.486 --> 13:10.390
DID YOU TAKE THAT PROPOSITION
SERIOUSLY?

13:10.457 --> 13:13.026
NO, I NEVER TOOK
ANY OF THAT SERIOUSLY.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.495
BUT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.966
WELL, IT WAS A JOKE,
A RUNNING GAG.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.902
I MEAN, LEAVE THE OVEN ON
WHILE HE'S SLEEPING.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.503
I MEAN, PUT AN APPLIANCE
IN THE TUB

13:23.570 --> 13:25.205
WHILE HE'S TAKING A BATH

13:25.272 --> 13:30.277
BUT IT WAS JUST TALK.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.811
THEN I TOLD HER
TO GO TO THE COPS.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.413
SHE SAID,
"I GOT THE COPS AT MY HOUSE

13:33.480 --> 13:35.815
EVERY TIME HE BELTS ME,
AND THEY DON'T DO SHIT.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.418
THEY TELL HIM TO COOL OFF."

13:40.353 --> 13:42.122
STILL, YOU ENCOURAGED HER
TO DO SOMETHING.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.190
YEAH.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.657
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

13:44.724 --> 13:48.128
YOU SYMPATHIZE
WITH HER PREDICAMENT.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.430
YOU SEE ANOTHER WOMAN,
A FRIEND, ABUSED

13:50.497 --> 13:52.399
YOU THINK SOMETHING
SHOULD BE DONE, RIGHT?

13:54.801 --> 13:56.803
I TOLD HER TO DIVORCE HIM.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.371
THROW HIM OUT.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.607
I DON'T KNOW.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.743
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A FRIEND,
TWO FRIENDS, MARRIED

14:03.810 --> 14:05.712
WHO ARE AT
EACH OTHER'S THROATS.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.915
YOU SEE HIM VERBALLY
AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE HER.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.817
SHE SAYS OVER AND OVER
SHE WANTS TO GET
RID OF THIS GUY

14:10.884 --> 14:14.187
AND YOU DON'T TAKE IT
SERIOUSLY?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.822
I WATCH THE HONEYMOONERS
EVERY NIGHT.

14:15.889 --> 14:16.990
I DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY.

14:18.258 --> 14:22.029
ONE OF THESE DAYS, CYNTHIA,
POW, RIGHT TO THE MOON.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.967
I'M GOING TO GET SOME WATER,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.235
YOU NEED THE TOILET?

14:28.301 --> 14:29.736
NO, THANKS.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.650
ALL RIGHT, SO...

14:43.716 --> 14:45.485
James:
EVERY FUCKING WEEK
I'VE GOT TO GO...

14:45.552 --> 14:47.254
Joyce:
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.822
WOULD YOU JUST GET ME
THE GODDAMN SUGAR?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.724
I'VE BEEN WORKING
ALL DAY.

14:51.791 --> 14:54.594
YOU CUT FUCKING HAIR.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.431
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WRONG WITH IT?

14:58.498 --> 14:59.766
YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.701
GET THE SUGAR YOURSELF.

15:01.768 --> 15:02.970
( pounding )

15:03.036 --> 15:05.105
James:
YOU GO GET IT.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.518
( bell rings )

15:19.152 --> 15:20.520
HERE WE ARE.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.055
THERE.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.659
JIMMY EXPECTS EVERYBODY
TO DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.328
JESUS CHRIST.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.297
COOKIE

15:30.363 --> 15:32.465
GO NEXT DOOR
AND BUY HIM SOME SUGAR.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.734
JOYCE, MY NAILS ARE WET.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.203
SO GO LIKE THIS.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.404
COME ON.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.571
( sighs )

15:38.638 --> 15:40.607
NO APPOINTMENTS, RIGHT?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.309
OF COURSE NOT.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.676
WHO WOULD GO TO A SHOP

15:43.743 --> 15:45.612
WITH LUNATICS
RUNNING AROUND UPSTAIRS?

15:45.678 --> 15:46.846
HE'S GOT TO GO.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.349
DID YOU ORDER THIS?

15:49.416 --> 15:50.683
NO.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.918
I'M SENDING IT BACK.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.654
SO WE'RE NOT GOING
TONIGHT?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.023
WE'RE GOING.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.025
I'M JUST NOT TAKING
THAT ANIMAL UP THERE.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.093
HE SHOULD DIE
IN HIS SLEEP.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.662
WE'RE A LITTLE SHORT.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.197
WE SHOULD WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.398
NO, NO, NO.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.566
I GOT SOME PUT ASIDE.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.834
YEAH?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.703
WELL, I'LL GET ARTHUR
TO WATCH THE KIDS.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.105
GREAT. THE HELL
WITH BOTH OF THEM.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.408
IT WILL BE
LIKE OLD TIMES.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.145
HERE. I HOPE
HE CHOKES ON IT.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.713
I DON'T NEED YOU
TODAY, COOKIE

16:22.315 --> 16:23.850
SO YOU CAN TAKE OFF.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.890
YOU'RE A REAL PAL,
JOYCE.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.659
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:32.725 --> 16:33.926
AH.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.297
( whistling )

16:50.643 --> 16:53.713
THERE. WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE HIM HIS SUGAR?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.982
I'M NOT GOING TO
GIVE HIM THAT.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.317
YOU WANT TO GIVE
HIM THE SUGAR?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.286
YOU GIVE HIM THE SUGAR.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.017
Cynthia:
NICE DOGGIES.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.520
YOU WANT TO GIVE HIM
A SMOOCH?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.423
Jennifer:
MOMMY, THIS LOOKS
LIKE BUTTERCUP.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.259
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOES.

17:39.326 --> 17:43.896
OKAY, SO NOW WE WAIT.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.698
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.067
YES, I DID.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.236
WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.604
UH-UH.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.973
COME SIT WITH
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.675
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.122
( baby crying )

18:10.123 --> 18:11.591
( knock at door )

18:11.658 --> 18:12.692
HEY THERE, CYN.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.793
WHAT'S UP?

18:14.527 --> 18:15.862
WANT SOME TEA?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.497
WE'VE GOT
TO TALK HERE.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.566
WHAT, DID JOYCE
SEND YOU UP HERE?

18:19.632 --> 18:23.336
NO. YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN
TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.206
IT'S NOT GOOD HOW
YOU FLY OFF THE HANDLE...

18:26.273 --> 18:29.309
I DON'T FLY OFF THE HANDLE
FOR NO GOOD REASON.

18:29.376 --> 18:31.678
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO TALK,
NOT YELL.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.447
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
INTIMIDATING EVERYBODY.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.950
YOU USED TO BE
SO HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.085
I'M HAPPY-GO-LU...

18:39.152 --> 18:41.821
I'M VERY HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.661
I DON'T INTIMIDATE YOU,
DO I?

18:50.029 --> 18:53.533
WELL, JAMES, YOU CAN BE
A LITTLE OVERBEARING.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.868
CYNTHIA, YOU SEE?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.637
HERE'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.739
I CAN TALK TO YOU.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.975
I CANNOT TALK
TO JOYCE.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.377
I CAN TALK
TO JOYCE.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.945
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD

19:06.012 --> 19:08.415
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONE OF
THE LAST PEOPLE IN BAYONNE

19:08.481 --> 19:10.116
THAT CAN TALK TO HER.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.321
GOT ENOUGH SUGAR?

19:14.387 --> 19:17.457
ARE YOU GOING TO START WITH ME
ABOUT THE SUGAR NOW TOO?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.927
I LIKE TEA, OKAY?
I LIKE COFFEE.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.462
I CAN'T TAKE IT
WITHOUT SUGAR.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.563
SHE KNOWS THIS.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.931
WE BEEN MARRIED
FIVE YEARS.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.067
YOU THINK SHE COULD
FIGURE THIS OUT?

19:28.134 --> 19:32.905
HOW HARD IS IT FOR ME
TO GET SOME SUGAR?

19:32.972 --> 19:35.107
ONCE A WEEK,
YOU LOOK IN THE CABINET.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.076
YOU GO, "UH-OH,
WE NEED SUGAR."

19:37.143 --> 19:39.946
YOU TAKE A PENCIL,
A PIECE OF PAPER.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.749
S-U-G-E-R,
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.252
YOU GO TO THE STORE,
YOU SAY, "WHAT DO I NEED--

19:45.318 --> 19:49.322
A ONE-POUND BOX,
THAT BIG FIVE-POUND SACK?"

19:49.389 --> 19:50.623
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.459
YOU BRING
THE SUGAR HOME.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.261
BUT CAN I
GET SOME SUGAR?

19:54.327 --> 19:56.796
NO, BUT WE CAN HAVE
THIS ARGUMENT.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.966
FIVE MINUTES LATER, I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I'M YELLING ABOUT.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.303
YOU WEARING A BRA TODAY?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.171
( phone rings )

20:10.543 --> 20:11.644
WHAT?

20:11.711 --> 20:12.712
Is Cynthia there?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.980
WE'RE TALKING HERE.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.214
Did you get the sugar?

20:15.282 --> 20:17.917
YES, THANK YOU, AND FUCK YOU.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.320
OH, SHIT!

20:20.853 --> 20:22.955
OH, CYNTHIA.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.491
WE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.925
CYNTHIA SPILLED THE TEA.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.428
HOLD ON, LET ME GET
THE DUSTBUSTER.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.796
LOOK OUT.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.337
WAIT. YOU'VE GOT
SOME SUGAR ON YOU.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.405
JIMMY.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.872
LET ME SEE YOUR TITS.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.207
I'M NOT LETTING YOU

20:41.274 --> 20:42.909
LOOK AT MY TITS.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.044
JOYCE IS DOWNSTAIRS.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.079
I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY NOTHING.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.247
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.616
ISN'T THAT WHAT
BEST FRIENDS ARE FOR?

20:49.682 --> 20:50.950
I'VE GOT TO GO.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.319
ALL RIGHT.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.321
LET ME GET THE DOOR.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.728
OPEN THE DOOR.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.930
SHOW ME YOUR TITTIES.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.998
OPEN THE DOOR.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.600
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO--

21:07.667 --> 21:09.302
SCREAM?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.203
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.673
HELP, JOYCE.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.642
JIMMY WANTS ME
TO SHOW HIM MY TITTIES

21:15.708 --> 21:16.876
BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.445
I GOT CUSTOMERS
DOWNSTAIRS.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.513
LET ME JUST
SEE YOUR TITS.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.281
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
DOING THIS TO ME?

21:22.349 --> 21:25.518
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.820
I'VE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.789
GET YOUR HAND
OUT OF THERE.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.158
DON'T DO THIS.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.793
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.628
FUCKING MOOCH!

21:35.695 --> 21:40.099
GO AHEAD. RUN DOWN THERE
AND TELL HER WHAT I DID.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.135
I DON'T WANT TO SEE EITHER
OF YOUR FACES UP HERE AGAIN

21:43.202 --> 21:47.106
OR I WILL NOT
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.908
Cynthia:
I DIDN'T THINK
SHE WOULD DO IT.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.711
JAMES WOULD BE DEAD
IF YOU DIDN'T STOP IT.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.080
I THOUGHT
IF I HADN'T STOPPED IT

21:54.146 --> 21:55.448
SHE WOULD HAVE.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.517
IT WAS A SICK GAME.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.886
WHAT DID SHE SAY
ABOUT THE SUGAR?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.954
UM...

22:02.021 --> 22:04.457
SHE SAID, "YOU DROPPED
THE SUGAR ON THE FLOOR?"

22:04.524 --> 22:06.893
I SAID, "OF COURSE.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?"

22:06.959 --> 22:09.061
AND SHE SAID, "YOU SEE?"

22:11.130 --> 22:13.733
MEANING?

22:13.800 --> 22:17.003
MEANING "WE COULD HAVE
GOT RID OF HIM
AND YOU DIDN'T."

22:17.069 --> 22:18.905
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.139
YOU SAID "WE."

22:20.206 --> 22:21.374
"WE COULD HAVE
GOT RID OF HIM."

22:21.441 --> 22:22.509
NO, I DIDN'T.

22:22.575 --> 22:23.610
YOU DID.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.677
NO, I DIDN'T.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.446
I CAN PLAY IT BACK.

22:26.513 --> 22:27.647
WELL, SO.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.049
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.084
EVERYTHING MEANS
SOMETHING, CYNTHIA.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.687
IT DOESN'T MEAN
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING--

22:34.754 --> 22:35.888
WHAT YOU WANT.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.957
ALL I WANT
IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.225
THAT'S ALL.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.695
WHEN YOU
LEFT THE SHOP

22:42.762 --> 22:44.964
WHAT ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.132
Arthur:
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.299
YOU SURE?

22:47.366 --> 22:50.102
I CAN GET A SITTER.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.038
DON'T PUT YOUR FIRE ENGINE
ON DADDY'S HARD WORK.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.573
I'LL TELL SANTA
NOT TO COME.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.508
LET'S GO WATCH FRAGGLES.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.010
DADDY WILL LET YOU
STAY UP A LITTLE LATER.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.347
DON'T THREATEN HER, ARTHUR.
SHE'LL RESENT YOU.

23:01.414 --> 23:04.116
SHE RESENTS HER MOTHER
LEAVING HER ALONE.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.818
DON'T PUT YOUR FEELINGS
ON HER.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.986
YOU CAN COME OUT.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.888
I'M WORKING.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.823
I'VE GOT TO GET
A NEW PITCH READY.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.459
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.160
YOU SAID YOU
WOULD GO OVER IT.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.229
I'LL GO OVER IT
TOMORROW.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.265
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ASSOCIATE
WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.400
LET'S NOT INSULT
EACH OTHER'S FRIENDS.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.971
THE GUY HANGS OUT
IN THE PLAYGROUND.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.773
YOUR FRIENDS

23:26.839 --> 23:28.508
WOULD SCREW YOU
IN A MINUTE.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.342
( horn honks )

23:33.045 --> 23:35.582
THERE'S A HUNGRY MAN
IN THE FREEZER.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.283
THE BOTTLE'S IN THE FRIDGE.

23:37.349 --> 23:38.485
HEAT IT UP.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.752
WOULD YOU
TAKE OUT THE DOG?

23:39.819 --> 23:40.853
YEAH, YEAH.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.655
OKAY.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.923
WATCH YOUR BROTHER.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.892
IF HE STARTS DRINKING

23:45.958 --> 23:47.259
YOU TAKE
A CAB HOME.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.861
HE'S NOT GOING.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.029
GET YOUR BROTHER.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.998
HE'S GOING
UP THE STAIRS.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.439
HI.

24:00.507 --> 24:01.574
HEY.

24:05.011 --> 24:07.980
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.785
( imitating Woody Woodpecker )

24:12.852 --> 24:13.920
GUESS WHO?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.458
WE'RE PARTYING, BABY.

24:19.526 --> 24:20.927
JOYCIE, TURN THE RADIO ON.

24:20.993 --> 24:21.994
Joyce:
YOU BROKE IT.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.730
I DIDN'T BREAK
THE RADIO.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.532
IT WASN'T FIXED.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.867
I'LL JUST HAVE TO SING.

24:27.934 --> 24:32.772
* EVERYBODY WAS
KUNG FU FIGHTING

24:32.839 --> 24:37.243

FRIGHTENING

24:37.309 --> 24:40.980
* THOSE CATS

JAMES DID GO WITH YOU?

24:43.349 --> 24:44.951
Cynthia:
YEAH.

24:45.017 --> 24:48.521
JOYCE COULDN'T GET
OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT HIM.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.724
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.425
WAS HE HAVING A GOOD TIME?

24:53.492 --> 24:56.596
* James:

MR. MOREHEAD.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.271
ARTHUR.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.539
GOT MORE HEAD THAN HAIR?

25:07.874 --> 25:09.609
HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

25:09.676 --> 25:13.112
James:
HE DOESN'T APPROVE
OF THE URBANSKI FAMILY.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.114
HE'S WITH THE KIDS.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.449
YOU COULD HAVE DONE
SO MUCH BETTER, CYNTHIA.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.685
LIKE JOYCE HERE.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.291
JOYCE, STOP BEING SUCH A SHIT.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.126
JESUS.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.961
YOU BETTER
TREAT ME NICE.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.198
I MAY HAVE TO THROW A SHOT
INTO CYNTHIA.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.600
JIMMY, COME ON.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.035

25:41.140 --> 25:43.275
I'LL CRACK UP THIS VAN.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.644
I DARE YOU.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.945
DON'T DARE ME.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.814
I QUADRUPLE
DARE YOU.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.150
COME ON, GET OVER.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.318

26:27.253 --> 26:28.655
WHOA, GODDAMN!

26:46.072 --> 26:48.708
IF YOU WANT TO KILL EACH OTHER

26:48.775 --> 26:50.209
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.978
THIS IS HOW WE PARTY.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.481
YOU'VE GOT TO PLAN
ON EXCITEMENT.

26:55.547 --> 26:56.615
COME HERE.

26:56.683 --> 26:57.784
LEAVE HER GO.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.352
LOOK, TELL ME

27:00.419 --> 27:02.321
I LIKE YOU.

27:02.388 --> 27:03.589
OOH. GIVE ME $20.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.091
I'M FEELING LUCKY.

27:05.157 --> 27:08.060
IF YOU'RE SO LUCKY,
WHAT DO YOU NEED $20 FOR?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.561
DON'T MAKE
ME ANGRY.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.630
JUST GIVE ME
THE FUCKING MONEY.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.032
HERE'S THE MONEY.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.333

FOR YOURSELF.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.441

27:22.508 --> 27:24.877
DON'T LET HER FUCK AROUND,
ALL RIGHT?

27:24.944 --> 27:25.945
GO. ADIOS.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.910
( calliope music )

28:06.485 --> 28:08.220
Woods:
BEFORE HE LEAVES

28:08.287 --> 28:10.723
JOYCE GIVES JAMES
A LITTLE MONEY

28:10.790 --> 28:12.725
SOME DRUGS AND WHATNOT.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.894
YEAH.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.031
WELL, THAT'S A LITTLE ODD,
ISN'T IT?

28:19.098 --> 28:22.101
YOU SAID THAT WAS ONE
OF JOYCE'S COMPLAINTS

28:22.168 --> 28:23.770
ABOUT JAMES-- THE DRUGS.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.905
IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION

28:25.972 --> 28:29.341
SHE JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO GET INTO A FIGHT WITH HIM.

28:29.408 --> 28:33.312
EXACTLY, AND AT SOME POINT
IT'S GOING TO HIT HIM.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.548
AT SOME POINT
HE'S GOING TO JUST FALL OUT.

28:36.615 --> 28:37.616
INCAPACITATED.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.551
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO FIGHT.

28:39.618 --> 28:40.987
HE WON'T RESIST.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.691
IT NEVER STRUCK ME THAT WAY.

28:45.758 --> 28:49.361
THAT NEVER CROSSES YOUR MIND?

28:49.428 --> 28:50.897
NO.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.901
Nealon:
WHEN'S THE NEXT TIME
YOU SEE THEM?

28:54.967 --> 29:00.239
UH, THEY WERE ARGUING,
AND I WAS OVER
PLAYING ROULETTE.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.488
I'M BROKE, ALL RIGHT?

29:16.555 --> 29:18.657
ALL I FIND ON YOU
I CAN KEEP?

29:18.724 --> 29:20.759
YOU CAN'T
EVEN STAY STRAIGHT
FOR ONE NIGHT.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.567
GIVE IT TO ME.

29:28.634 --> 29:30.903
DON'T FUCKING START
WITH ME, JOYCE.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.539
DO YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD CALM DOWN HERE?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.507
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

29:35.574 --> 29:37.643
HEY.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.856
HEY, LET'S...

29:52.358 --> 29:54.293
WHY DO YOU GUYS
HAVE TO DO THIS?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.428
HERE'S THE KEYS.

29:56.495 --> 29:57.763
DRIVE YOURSELF HOME.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.031
GET OUT OF HERE.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.400
YOU CAN'T LET HIM DRIVE
LIKE THIS.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.734
WHOO.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.570
I FUCKING
HATE THIS SHIT.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.172
JIMMY,
GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.573
GET OUT OF HERE.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.708
GET OUT OF HERE.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.013
GIVE ME THE KEYS, JIMMY.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.588
JIMMY?

30:23.589 --> 30:25.958
JIMMY?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.265
I'M ALL FUCKED UP.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.934
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.235
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.471
DON'T JOSTLE ME AROUND.
DON'T JOSTLE ME AROUND.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.806
YOU'RE JOSTLING ME.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.441
I'M GOING TO GET SICK.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.642
OKAY.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.278
HEY, COME ON, JIMMY,
LEAVE OFF.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.980
WHY DON'T YOU LAY DOWN?

30:48.047 --> 30:49.815
TELL JOYCE
I WANT TO TALK TO HER.

30:49.882 --> 30:50.983
I'LL DO THAT.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.619
TELL HER TO COME
OUT HERE, ALL RIGHT?

30:53.685 --> 30:55.121
OKAY.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.660
Woods:
SO, THERE IT IS.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.695
HE'S FALLING OVER DRUNK
AND DRUGGED UP

31:03.762 --> 31:05.731
AND YOU'RE HELPING HIM
GET BACK TO THE VAN?

31:05.797 --> 31:09.301
YEAH. I WANTED TO GET HIM
WHERE HE COULD LAY DOWN.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.004
SO, YOU TAKE HIM
BACK TO THE TRUCK
WHERE HE'S OUT OF SIGHT

31:12.071 --> 31:14.941
WHERE HE WON'T DRAW
ANY ATTENTION

31:15.007 --> 31:17.443
AND HE FALLS OUT?

31:17.509 --> 31:20.947
YEAH, AND THEN
I WENT ON BACK TO THE FEAST.

31:21.013 --> 31:24.016
AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SEE HIM ALIVE?

31:24.083 --> 31:26.085
UH...

31:27.987 --> 31:30.089
YEAH.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.669
CYNTHIA!

31:44.870 --> 31:46.072
CYNTHIA!

31:46.138 --> 31:47.306
WE HAVE TO GO.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.441
I'M WINNING.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.279
WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.214
COME ON. COME ON.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.288
I WAS PLAYING NINE
AND WON

32:02.354 --> 32:04.223
AND INSTEAD
OF CHANGING NUMBERS

32:04.290 --> 32:05.591
I JUST LET IT RIDE.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.726
THE GUY SAID
I WAS ON A ROLL.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.561
I MEAN,
I'M NEVER LUCKY.

32:09.628 --> 32:10.896
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.765
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
I HAVE THEM.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.901
IS JAMES STILL SLEEPING?

32:15.968 --> 32:17.970
YEAH.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.606
I BETTER JUST CALM MYSELF DOWN

32:20.672 --> 32:22.508
OR I COULD
GET INTO TROUBLE.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.644
SO JOYCE, I WAS
GOING TO PLAY SEVEN...

32:31.350 --> 32:32.551
I WON ABOUT $40.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.086
WELL, ACTUALLY, NO

32:34.153 --> 32:37.156
BECAUSE I STARTED WITH 20
SO IT WAS ONLY 20.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.757
IT FELT LIKE 40.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.592
DID YOU WIN?

32:41.127 --> 32:43.195
JOYCE?

32:43.262 --> 32:44.896
EARTH TO JOYCE.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.099
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

32:56.442 --> 32:58.110
I THINK I KILLED HIM.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.413
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:01.480 --> 33:03.282
COME HERE.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.354
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, MAN.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.523
HE WAS CHOKING ME.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.392
Cynthia:
JAMES, ARE YOU UP?

33:17.529 --> 33:18.764
HE GRABBED ME
BY THE THROAT

33:18.830 --> 33:20.166
SO I CUT HIM
ON THE, ON THE...

33:20.232 --> 33:21.333
ON THE, WHAT?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.035
IT WAS THE JUGULAR.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.171
OH, JOYCE.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.739
JOYCE.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.477
COULD YOU SEE ANY AREA
OF THE BODY THAT WAS WOUNDED?

33:31.543 --> 33:33.779
WHERE...
WHERE WERE THE WOUNDS?

33:33.845 --> 33:34.946
I DON'T KNOW.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.782
I COULDN'T SEE THE WOUND.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.484
THERE WAS JUST BLOOD.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.152
WELL, DID YOU CHECK?

33:40.219 --> 33:42.121
WAS THERE A PULSE?
WAS HE BREATHING?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.823
I COULDN'T SEE.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.992
AND YOU DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS HURT?

33:47.059 --> 33:48.794
LET'S GET HIM TO A DOCTOR?

33:48.860 --> 33:51.063
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I SAID TO HER

33:51.130 --> 33:53.732
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.635
I WAS BEGGING HER TO GO.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.470
YOU WERE BEGGING HER?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.739
Joyce:
WE'LL TELL THE COPS
HE DISAPPEARED.

34:00.806 --> 34:02.641
Cynthia:
WE HAVE TO REPORT THIS
TO THE POLICE

34:02.708 --> 34:07.313
OR YOU'LL BE
IN EVEN BIGGER TROUBLE
THAN YOU ARE NOW.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.315
WHAT IF THE COPS
DON'T BELIEVE ME?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.951
I'D GO TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

34:13.018 --> 34:14.886
SHIT.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.465
Man:
HEY, HEY, SWEETHEART.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.734
YOU NEED
A LITTLE HELP, BABE?

34:28.800 --> 34:30.636
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.571
OH. OH, WHOA. HEY.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.992
HERE WE COME, BABY!

34:54.059 --> 34:55.527
HERE. HAVE A BEER.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.828
BITCH!

34:56.895 --> 35:00.332
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PUT HIM SOMEPLACE, CYNTHIA.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.134
YOU HEAR ME?

35:02.201 --> 35:03.702
I HEAR YOU.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.071
MAYBE BY
THAT OLD TRAIN YARD.
THAT SWAMPY PLACE.

35:06.138 --> 35:08.207
WE GOT TO GET
OUR STORY STRAIGHT.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.277
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT
AND HE JUST TOOK OFF.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.611
NO! WE DIDN'T ARGUE.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.946
HE WAS WINNING
AND HE TOOK OFF.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.782
JUST SAY HE WAS WINNING.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.350
WE'LL TAKE HIS WALLET.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.153
WE'LL HIDE IT AND SAY
PEOPLE ROBBED HIM.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.289
Woods: SO YOU'RE DISCUSSING
THE COVER?

35:23.355 --> 35:26.091
SHE WAS
JUST GIVING INSTRUCTIONS.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.260
BUT WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.095
THINKING? WHO WAS THINKING?

35:30.162 --> 35:32.264
EVERYTHING WAS MOVING
SO FAST.

35:32.331 --> 35:35.267
YOU MADE NO ATTEMPT
TO GET AWAY FROM HER?

35:35.334 --> 35:36.602
THE VAN'S DOING 90.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.103
YOU WANT I SHOULD JUMP?

35:38.170 --> 35:41.106
YOU MADE NO ATTEMPT
TO SEE IF HE WAS ALIVE?

35:41.173 --> 35:42.641
HE WASN'T FUCKING MOVING.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.126
TAKE HIS LEG.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.294
JOYCE, I CAN'T.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.331
CYNTHIA, I CAN'T
DO THIS BY MYSELF.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.800
NOW... PUSH.

36:45.871 --> 36:49.107
JOHN, YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO BOOK HER.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.109
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THAT.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.644
I WANT TO KEEP GOING.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.480
WE CAN ALWAYS PICK HER UP.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.283
OKAY. THIS IS YOUR SHOW.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.391
YOU HAD
THE MURDER WEAPON

37:05.457 --> 37:06.592
IN YOUR HAND?

37:06.658 --> 37:09.428
YOU PICKED IT UP
AND THREW IT AWAY?

37:09.495 --> 37:12.063
BY INSTINCT.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.066
SO YOU AREN'T THINKING
STRAIGHT AT THIS TIME?

37:15.133 --> 37:17.068
NOT REALLY.

37:17.135 --> 37:20.406
YOU KNOW ENOUGH TO GET RID
OF THE MURDER WEAPON.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.909
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
ANYTHING THEY COULD TRACE.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.644
BUT YOU LEFT THE BODY.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.314
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T
THINKING STRAIGHT.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.181
Nealon:
WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.484
I THINK WE SHOULD
SAY SOMETHING

37:32.551 --> 37:33.985
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

37:34.052 --> 37:35.787
Joyce: IT IS TOO LATE.
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.055
WE CAN STILL CALL THE POLICE.

37:37.122 --> 37:38.223
NO WE CAN'T.

37:38.290 --> 37:39.725
YES, WE CAN, JOYCE.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.394
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE NOTHING.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.063
YOU GOT TO LISTEN
BECAUSE WE ARE IN DEEP SHIT.

37:45.130 --> 37:47.333
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.368
I MEAN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?

37:49.435 --> 37:51.603
WE'RE GOING TO SAY
WE DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.706
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.375
WE DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER.

37:56.442 --> 37:59.177
THAT WAY WE DON'T
MIX OUR STORIES UP.

37:59.244 --> 38:01.980
YOU TELL ARTHUR
THAT ME AND JIMMY HAD A FIGHT.

38:02.047 --> 38:05.517
YOU DECIDED
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.787
YOU GET THE VAN CLEANED UP
IN THE MORNING.

38:08.854 --> 38:09.955
WHY ME?

38:10.021 --> 38:11.623
BECAUSE I GOT
TO BE HERE.

38:11.690 --> 38:15.193
I GOT TO REPORT HIM MISSING
TO THE COPS IN THE MORNING.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.497
YOU TAKE HIS WALLET
AND HIS JEWELRY FOR ME.

38:18.564 --> 38:19.665
GET RID OF IT.

38:19.731 --> 38:20.866
I CAN'T DO THAT.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.300
WHY NOT?

38:22.368 --> 38:23.435
I'M JUST NOT READY FOR THAT.
I CAN'T DO IT.

38:23.502 --> 38:24.970
DO YOU WANT THEM
TO FIND THIS ON YOU?

38:25.036 --> 38:26.271
NO.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.673
I'M TELLING YOU
JUST GET RID
OF THIS SHIT.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.342
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.477
OH, MAN.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.978
I WILL.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.646
I'M REALLY AFRAID, JOYCE.

38:34.713 --> 38:38.550
I DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

38:38.617 --> 38:41.687
I REALLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU DID.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.556
I LOVE YOU FOR IT,
YOU KNOW THAT.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.992
WE...

38:47.058 --> 38:48.193
LISTEN TO ME.

38:48.259 --> 38:49.795
WE ARE FRIENDS

38:49.861 --> 38:52.698
AND WE'RE GOING TO WATCH OUT
FOR EACH OTHER FOREVER.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.866
AM I RIGHT?

38:56.301 --> 38:58.303
DON'T WORRY.

38:58.370 --> 39:02.240
CYNTHIA, PLEASE DON'T WORRY.

39:02.307 --> 39:03.442
I GOT TO GO.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.010
I GOT TO GET HOME.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.480
JOYCE CALLED HER MOTHER-IN-LAW
AND STARTED THE STORY

39:08.547 --> 39:10.449
ABOUT JIMMY DISAPPEARING
AT THE CARNIVAL.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.484
GLORIA JUST HUNG UP ON HER.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.952
JOYCE SAID, "HE'S DEAD

39:14.019 --> 39:15.921
AND WHAT THE FUCK
DOES SHE CARE?"

39:15.987 --> 39:17.423
I JUST WALKED HOME.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.131
Arthur:
CYNTHIA?

39:28.500 --> 39:29.901
CYNTHIA?

39:29.968 --> 39:31.236
YEAH?

39:31.302 --> 39:32.938
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:33.004 --> 39:35.006
NOTHING. GO BACK TO BED.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.442
YOU GOT TO TAKE OUT BUTTERCUP.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.276
I FORGOT TO TAKE HER OUT.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.446
YEAH. OKAY.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.985
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, HUH?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.353
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:48.420 --> 39:50.188
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

39:50.255 --> 39:52.691
CYNTHIA?

39:52.758 --> 39:54.359
WHAT? HEY.

39:54.426 --> 39:58.029
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

39:58.096 --> 39:59.998
WHAT'S WRONG, HUH?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.502
WHAT?

40:03.569 --> 40:05.336
JOYCE KILLED JIMMY.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.672
JOYCE KILLED JIMMY?

40:06.738 --> 40:09.040
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING...

40:10.576 --> 40:11.843
CYNTHIA. MY GOD.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.345
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

40:14.412 --> 40:17.015
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY...
THEY WERE FIGHTING

40:17.082 --> 40:18.850
AND HE TRIED TO CHOKE HER

40:18.917 --> 40:20.719
SO SHE STABBED HIM
WITH A RAZOR.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.387
SHE... WHAT DO YOU..?

40:22.454 --> 40:25.356
HOW DO YOU STAB SOMEONE
WITH A RAZOR?

40:25.423 --> 40:26.558
I DON'T KNOW.

40:26.625 --> 40:28.393
A SLICE. YOU KNOW.
A CUT.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.698
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.299
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:34.365 --> 40:36.568
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED EXACTLY.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.538
THEY WERE FIGHTING
ALL NIGHT.
HE WAS FUCKED UP.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.940
I LEFT HIM IN THE VAN,
SLEEPING.

40:42.007 --> 40:44.209
DID YOU SEE HER?

40:44.275 --> 40:46.878
NO. I DIDN'T SEE HER.

40:46.945 --> 40:50.148
AFTER. AFTER, I SAW HER.

40:50.215 --> 40:51.783
HE WAS CUT UP BAD.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.785
THAT DON'T MEAN
HE'S DEAD.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.087
JESUS CHRIST, ARTHUR.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.624
I HAVE BLOOD ALL OVER ME.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.826
I HELPED HER GET RID OF
THE BODY, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.328
ALL RIGHT. JUST CALM DOWN.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.396
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.833
HOW COULD YOU GO ALONG
WITH HER ON THIS?

41:09.134 --> 41:11.269
I DON'T KNOW.

41:11.336 --> 41:14.740
JUST HAPPENED SO FAST.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.041
OH, CHRIST.

41:16.107 --> 41:19.277
LOOK, I WARNED YOU
ABOUT THOSE TWO.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.346
THEY'RE CRAZY.
THEY'RE ANIMALS.

41:21.412 --> 41:23.515
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN WITH THEM.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.083
WE GOT TO CALL SOMEBODY.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.318
AND SAY WHAT?

41:27.385 --> 41:29.555
SAY WHAT?

41:29.621 --> 41:31.022
SAY WHAT HAPPENED...

41:31.089 --> 41:34.192
WHATEVER HAPPENED,
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.494
YOU'RE PRETTY INNOCENT, RIGHT?

41:36.562 --> 41:39.497
CYNTHIA, YOU TOLD ME
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

41:39.565 --> 41:40.832
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE

41:40.899 --> 41:43.501
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME
YOU COULD SAY THAT?

41:43.569 --> 41:45.503
YOU WANT ME
TO CALL THE POLICE?

41:45.571 --> 41:47.005
I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

41:47.072 --> 41:50.008
WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION
GOING TO BE?

41:50.075 --> 41:52.177
I DON'T HAVE
AN EXPLANATION.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.345
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
AN EXPLANATION.

41:55.781 --> 41:56.948
YOU GET ME TO DO
WHAT YOU WANT

41:57.015 --> 41:58.516
AND THEN YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO DO IT.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.418
WHY IS IT
YOU START THINGS

42:00.485 --> 42:01.853
AT ALL THE WRONG TIMES?

42:01.920 --> 42:03.722
I'M BUSTING MY FUCKING ASS

42:03.789 --> 42:05.624
TRYING
TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

42:05.691 --> 42:08.126
WHO THE HELL IS GOING
TO BUY ANYTHING

42:08.193 --> 42:10.929
FROM A KILLER'S WIFE...
HUSBAND'S WIFE...

42:10.996 --> 42:12.798
WHATEVER THE FUCK WE ARE?

42:12.864 --> 42:17.803
WHY DO I TELL YOU ANYTHING?

42:17.869 --> 42:19.971
SHIT.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.143
SHE ACTUALLY KILLED HIM?

42:26.311 --> 42:28.647
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

42:28.714 --> 42:29.848
IT'S HER PROBLEM.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.149
I'M OUT OF IT.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.351
SHE SWORE
SHE WOULDN'T INVOLVE ME.

42:33.418 --> 42:35.687
SHE SAID THAT?

42:35.754 --> 42:37.522
SHE SWORE UP AND DOWN.

42:37.589 --> 42:40.992
SO IF SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO CALL THE POLICE
LET HER BE THE ONE.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.829
LOOK AT YOU.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.331
TAKE THIS OFF, HUH?

42:46.397 --> 42:47.666
MY GOD.

42:47.733 --> 42:49.835
IF ANYBODY SAW YOU,
CYNTHIA...

42:49.901 --> 42:51.002
COME ON. COME ON.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.370
LOOK AT THIS BLOOD.

42:52.437 --> 42:55.173
IT'S GOING TO NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER COME OFF.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.541
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

42:56.608 --> 42:57.876
CHRIST ALMIGHTY.

42:57.943 --> 42:59.678
LISTEN, YOU HAVE
TO CUT IT OFF.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.780
YOU HAVE TO NOT SEE HER.

43:02.547 --> 43:03.815
WHERE'S THE JOY?

43:03.882 --> 43:05.016
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

43:05.083 --> 43:07.352
THE DETERGENT. THE SOAP.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.220
YOU MEAN CHEER.

43:09.287 --> 43:10.321
JOY. CHEER.

43:10.388 --> 43:11.790
DECK THE FUCKING HALLS

43:11.857 --> 43:13.792
WITH BOUGHS OF HOLLY,
CYNTHIA.

43:13.859 --> 43:15.126
UNDER THE SINK.

43:15.193 --> 43:16.461
AND NOBODY SAW YOU?

43:16.527 --> 43:17.663
NOBODY SAW US

43:17.729 --> 43:20.666
AND SHE WON'T TELL ANYBODY
I WAS WITH HER.

43:20.732 --> 43:22.968
THIS BETTER BE
THE END OF IT.

43:23.034 --> 43:26.772
THE KIDS WILL
LOSE THEIR MOTHER.
I'LL LOSE A FUCKING JOB

43:26.838 --> 43:27.906
AND THEN WE'LL BE
ON THE STREETS.

43:27.973 --> 43:29.741
ON THE FUCKING STREETS.

43:39.217 --> 43:42.520
DID YOUR HUSBAND PERSIST
ABOUT CALLING THE POLICE?

43:42.587 --> 43:44.622
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE INVOLVED EITHER.

43:44.690 --> 43:46.524
WE WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY KIDS.

43:46.591 --> 43:48.393
I DON'T KNOW.

43:50.228 --> 43:53.965
SOME THINGS...

43:54.032 --> 43:55.466
I DON'T KNOW.

43:58.870 --> 44:00.906
DID YOU THINK YOU
WOULD GET AWAY WITH THIS?

44:01.840 --> 44:03.441
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

44:05.510 --> 44:07.979
I MAY HAVE MIXED FEELINGS
ABOUT JAMES

44:08.046 --> 44:09.948
BUT I WOULD NEVER RAISE A HAND
TO ANYONE.

44:10.015 --> 44:11.750
I WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE!

44:13.785 --> 44:15.020
NOW LOOK,

44:15.086 --> 44:16.287
IF JOYCE WAS GOING
TO GET CAUGHT

44:16.354 --> 44:17.555
THEN SHE
WAS GOING TO GET CAUGHT.

44:17.622 --> 44:18.757
I AM NOT GOING
TO BE THE ONE
TO TURN ON HER.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.763
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU NODDING FOR?

44:24.830 --> 44:26.297
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

44:26.364 --> 44:29.768
YOU HAVE A SO-CALLED
FRIEND WHO BRUTALLY MURDERS
HER HUSBAND,

44:29.835 --> 44:32.938
ORPHANS HIS KID
AND DROPS HIS BODY OFF,

44:33.004 --> 44:34.505
AND YOU'RE PROTECTING HER?

44:34.572 --> 44:36.074
COPS DON'T PROTECT
EACH OTHER?

44:36.141 --> 44:37.242
THAT'S FUCKING NEWS!

44:37.308 --> 44:38.710
DON'T GIVE ME ANY LIP, LADY.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.879
Nealon: OKAY, NOW'S
A GOOD TIME

44:40.946 --> 44:42.213
TO TAKE A BREAK.

44:42.914 --> 44:44.182
JOHN?

44:44.249 --> 44:46.117
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.819
WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

44:47.886 --> 44:50.088
WANT TO USE
THE TOILET?

44:50.155 --> 44:52.190
WANT A SANDWICH
OR SOMETHING?

45:06.037 --> 45:07.205
Man: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MY DEAR?

45:07.272 --> 45:08.339
Joyce: YEAH.

45:08.406 --> 45:09.674
I AM HER ATTORNEY.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.276
I DEMAND TO KNOW

45:11.342 --> 45:13.511
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY CLIENT.

45:28.693 --> 45:30.028
SO, DO YOU DO
YOUR OWN HAIR?

45:30.095 --> 45:32.163
IT'S NICE HOW YOU SWEEP IT UP
IN THE BACK THERE.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.431
YEAH, I DO.

46:10.568 --> 46:13.839
Nealon:
CYNTHIA, THERE ARE A FEW
THINGS I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY.

46:13.905 --> 46:15.740
YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND

46:15.807 --> 46:17.642
AND SWORE TO AVOID CONTACT
WITH JOYCE?

46:17.708 --> 46:18.776
Cynthia:
YES.

46:18.844 --> 46:20.011
Woods:
HOW LONG DID THAT LAST?

46:20.078 --> 46:21.112
( ringing )

46:22.547 --> 46:23.849
HELLO?

46:23.915 --> 46:26.818
Joyce: Cynthia, you've got
to come over here right now.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.419
It's an emergency.

46:28.486 --> 46:29.654
WHAT'S WRONG?

46:29.720 --> 46:31.222
You've got to come right now.

46:33.324 --> 46:34.592
OKAY.

47:12.163 --> 47:15.066
( crying )

47:15.133 --> 47:16.834
Cookie:
DOMINIC, YOU WANT
SOME COFFEE?

47:16.902 --> 47:19.537
NO. I DON'T WANT ANY COFFEE.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.739
AFTER YOU GO TO BED
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.

47:21.806 --> 47:23.041
( knocking )

47:23.108 --> 47:25.510
JOYCE?

47:26.844 --> 47:28.013
IT'S CYNTHIA.

47:28.079 --> 47:29.147
I'M GLAD SHE'S HERE.

47:29.214 --> 47:30.715
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

47:30.781 --> 47:32.250
THEY FOUND A BODY.

47:32.317 --> 47:33.784
THEY THINK IT'S JIMMY.

47:33.851 --> 47:34.986
SIT DOWN.
SHE NEEDS YOU.

47:35.053 --> 47:37.555
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT'S GOING ON?

47:37.622 --> 47:39.557
Gloria:
PRAY IT'S NOT HIM, CINDY.

47:39.624 --> 47:42.193
PRAY TO ST. ANTHONY
IT'S A MISTAKE.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.895
THEY STILL
HAVE TO IDENTIFY...

47:43.962 --> 47:46.731
I SWEAR TO GOD
I'LL RING HIS NECK

47:46.797 --> 47:47.899
IF IT'S A MISTAKE!

47:47.966 --> 47:49.134
Cookie:
CINDY, COFFEE?

47:49.200 --> 47:52.270
WHY DID HE DO THIS
TO ME?

47:52.337 --> 47:54.072
Gloria:
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT!

47:54.139 --> 47:55.706
SHE'S NOT
BLAMING HIM.

47:55.773 --> 47:57.575
( everyone arguing )

47:57.642 --> 47:59.110
SHE'S NOT
BLAMING HIM.

47:59.177 --> 48:00.478
WHERE'S ANTHONY?

48:00.545 --> 48:02.347
HE'S AT HIS
AUNT MARIE'S.

48:02.413 --> 48:06.017
HOW DO I TELL MY SON
HIS FATHER'S IN HEAVEN?

48:06.084 --> 48:07.385
I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT.

48:07.452 --> 48:09.554
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN, DOMINIC?

48:09.620 --> 48:12.090
WHAT, I GOT TO EXPLAIN
IT TO YOU?

48:12.157 --> 48:13.959
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

48:14.025 --> 48:15.560
DON'T GIVE UP HOPE.

48:15.626 --> 48:16.661
JOEY?

48:16.727 --> 48:17.728
GET OVER HERE.

48:17.795 --> 48:19.030
( phone ringing )

48:19.097 --> 48:20.198
WAIT!

48:21.799 --> 48:23.068
HELLO?

48:23.134 --> 48:24.335
OH, MARILYN.

48:24.402 --> 48:26.171
( everyone sighs )

48:26.237 --> 48:27.872
NO, WE GOT TO BE

48:27.939 --> 48:30.741
AT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER'S
BY 9:00.

48:30.808 --> 48:33.044
YEAH, I KNOW.

48:33.111 --> 48:34.379
I CAN'T TALK NOW.

48:34.445 --> 48:37.748
CYNTHIA, YOU WERE WITH THEM
LAST NIGHT, NO?

48:37.815 --> 48:39.250
SHE COULDN'T GO.

48:39.317 --> 48:41.886
YEAH, THE KIDS WERE
COMING DOWN WITH A VIRUS...

48:41.953 --> 48:43.154
OR SOMETHING.

48:43.221 --> 48:46.924
FEVER BREAK?

48:46.992 --> 48:48.826
YEAH. IT BROKE THIS MORNING.

48:48.893 --> 48:49.927
SO YOU WENT?

48:49.995 --> 48:51.997
YEAH, WE WENT.
IT WAS GOOD.

48:52.063 --> 48:54.432
WE HAD WORDS-- SAME OLD JIMMY.

48:54.499 --> 48:55.933
I WAS TELLING GLORIA--

48:56.001 --> 48:58.069
HE WAS HIGH.
HE WAS HAPPY.

48:58.136 --> 48:59.637
HE WAS WINNING.

48:59.704 --> 49:00.738
THAT'S GOOD THEN.

49:00.805 --> 49:01.906
AND NOW THIS?

49:01.973 --> 49:04.275
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

49:04.342 --> 49:06.844
I EXPECT HIM TO COME WALKING
THROUGH THE DOOR ANY MINUTE.

49:06.911 --> 49:08.879
( knocking )

49:09.814 --> 49:11.382
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

49:11.449 --> 49:12.917
( everyone sighs )

49:12.984 --> 49:15.120
Cookie:
DUNKIN' DONUT?

49:15.186 --> 49:17.088
THEY CALLED ME
TO COME OVER.

49:17.155 --> 49:19.024
SHH. HAVE
A FUCKING DONUT.

49:19.090 --> 49:21.392
CYNTHIA, YOU
NEED THE KEYS

49:21.459 --> 49:23.394
TO THE VAN, RIGHT?

49:23.461 --> 49:25.863
COME HERE.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.069
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PICK UP
ALL THOSE WIGS

49:31.136 --> 49:32.403
AND HAIR PIECES
WE ORDERED.

49:32.470 --> 49:33.938
THEY'RE PROBABLY
READY BY NOW.

49:34.005 --> 49:35.473
WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

49:35.540 --> 49:37.042
THE OTHER DAY,
FROM THE CATALOG.

49:37.108 --> 49:38.109
REMEMBER?

49:38.176 --> 49:40.278
NO. WHEN WAS THAT?

49:40.345 --> 49:43.314
COOKIE, WE DON'T NEED
ALL THESE QUESTIONS.

49:43.381 --> 49:44.849
CYNTHIA KNOWS
WHAT TO DO.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.117
IF I HAD
TO DEPEND ON YOU

49:46.184 --> 49:47.452
FORGET IT.

49:47.518 --> 49:49.054
IT WAS ONLY
A QUESTION.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.621
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

49:50.688 --> 49:53.091
JOEY, I NEED YOU
HERE WITH ME.

49:53.158 --> 49:54.892
JOEY, JUST RELAX
AND SIT.

49:54.959 --> 49:59.097
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.
I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM.

49:59.164 --> 50:00.631
Aunt Rita:
WE SHOULD GO IN THE VAN.

50:00.698 --> 50:03.268
Joyce:
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HOW MANY PEOPLE..?

50:03.334 --> 50:04.435
THERE'S JUST
A COUPLE OF US.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.137
SHE'S GOT
ALL THESE BOXES.

50:06.204 --> 50:07.438
WELL, MY BAD BACK...

50:07.505 --> 50:10.541
JOYCE, WIGS?
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

50:10.608 --> 50:14.112
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?

50:14.179 --> 50:15.180
JUST CALM DOWN!

50:15.246 --> 50:16.314
JUST CALM DOWN.

50:16.381 --> 50:18.249
LET'S DO THIS
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

50:18.316 --> 50:20.618
CYNTHIA, YOU DO
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.

50:20.685 --> 50:24.021
WE'LL ALL FIT IN THE CAR
OR TAKE A CAB, ALL RIGHT?

50:24.089 --> 50:25.123
WHEN WE GET BACK

50:25.190 --> 50:27.392
MAYBE WE'LL HAVE
SOME GOOD NEWS.

50:53.418 --> 50:54.919
COME HERE.
STOP!

50:54.985 --> 50:56.687
CYNTHIA, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

51:05.830 --> 51:06.931
SHIT!

51:09.167 --> 51:10.835
Nealon:
SO JOYCE KEEPS HER END
OF THE BARGAIN--

51:10.901 --> 51:12.770
YOU WERE HOME.
YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE CARNIVAL.

51:12.837 --> 51:13.838
YEAH.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.241
AND WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THE VAN?

51:16.307 --> 51:19.210
I PARKED IT DOWN
THE BLOCK FROM ME.

51:19.277 --> 51:22.513
YOU HELPED GET RID
OF THE EVIDENCE?

51:22.580 --> 51:24.515
I THOUGHT,
"I'M OUT OF IT.

51:24.582 --> 51:25.783
"IF I CAN JUST
GET ME THROUGH THIS

51:25.850 --> 51:27.218
NOBODY WILL EVEN KNOW
I WAS THERE."

53:53.230 --> 53:54.865
WHAT'S GOING ON?

53:54.932 --> 53:56.867
THEY HEAR ANYTHING?

53:56.934 --> 53:58.869
SOMETHING FISHY
IS GOING ON HERE

53:58.936 --> 54:00.905
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE INVOLVED.

54:00.971 --> 54:02.273
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

54:02.340 --> 54:05.576
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL.
I'M NOT LYING
FOR ANYBODY.

54:05.643 --> 54:06.644
ABOUT WHAT?

54:06.711 --> 54:08.145
ABOUT THE VAN.

54:08.212 --> 54:10.315
JOYCE TOLD ME
WHAT TO SAY--

54:10.381 --> 54:13.484
THAT SOMEBODY BROKE INTO IT
AND CLEANED IT OUT.

54:13.551 --> 54:14.852
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON

54:14.919 --> 54:16.887
BUT I'M NOT LYING
FOR ANYBODY.

54:16.954 --> 54:17.988
WHY?

54:18.055 --> 54:19.223
WHY WHAT?

54:19.290 --> 54:23.561
JUST SAY SOMEBODY
BROKE INTO THE TRUCK.

54:23.628 --> 54:25.496
WE BOTH UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

54:25.563 --> 54:26.664
DON'T WE?

54:26.731 --> 54:28.333
I THINK SO.

54:32.370 --> 54:33.938
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
JOSEPH?

54:34.004 --> 54:35.940
YOU'LL SEE
WHAT I'M DOING, BABE.

54:36.006 --> 54:38.943
HEY, WHERE'S
ALL THE WIGS?

54:39.009 --> 54:40.411
THEY WEREN'T READY. SO?

54:40.478 --> 54:42.279
HOW COME THIS VAN
IS SO CLEAN?

54:42.347 --> 54:44.248
IT'S USUALLY
A PIGSTY.

54:44.315 --> 54:45.950
WHAT?

54:46.016 --> 54:47.418
YOU GOT SOMETHING
TO HIDE?

54:47.485 --> 54:49.153
THE WAY YOU DROVE
OUT OF HERE THIS MORNING...

54:49.219 --> 54:50.855
JOEY, YOU'RE CRAZY.

54:50.921 --> 54:52.122
( baby crying )

54:52.189 --> 54:55.292
YEAH, WE'LL SEE
HOW CRAZY I AM.

54:55.360 --> 54:57.662
WE'LL SEE HOW CRAZY
THE POLICE THINK I AM.

54:57.728 --> 54:59.263
WHAT SHOULD I TELL JOYCE?

54:59.330 --> 55:02.132
SHE CAN BURN IN HELL,
THAT'S WHAT.

55:02.199 --> 55:05.603
OH, THAT'S REAL NICE TALK
TO YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.809
Nealon:
DID YOU SEE JOYCE
AGAIN THAT DAY?

55:11.876 --> 55:13.444
Cynthia:
I DIDN'T SEE HER
UNTIL THE NEXT DAY--

55:13.511 --> 55:15.012
AT POLASKI'S.

55:15.079 --> 55:17.415
THAT'S A FUNERAL PARLOR
WHERE JAMES WAS LAID OUT.

55:28.225 --> 55:30.127
( sobbing )

55:30.194 --> 55:33.664
Gloria:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN.

55:33.731 --> 55:35.165
LOOK AT HIM.

55:35.232 --> 55:37.001
HE'S ALL ALONE UP THERE.

55:37.067 --> 55:38.168
OH, GOD.

55:39.704 --> 55:40.838
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO.

55:40.905 --> 55:43.007
HE'S THE FIRST TO GO.

55:44.274 --> 55:46.377
SHE MAKES ME SICK.

55:46.444 --> 55:48.546
ALWAYS THE ACTRESS.

55:48.613 --> 55:49.714
I'M THE WIFE.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.716
I'M THE ONE THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO COME TO.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.618
JUST KEEP YOUR DIGNITY.

55:53.684 --> 55:57.221
LET THEM BE
THE PHONIES THEY ARE.

56:01.225 --> 56:02.993
JOEY...

56:03.561 --> 56:04.795
THANKS.

56:43.868 --> 56:46.571
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SITTING BACK HERE?

56:46.637 --> 56:51.709
THEY GOT HERE FIRST
AND TOOK ALL THE FRONT SEATS.

56:51.776 --> 56:55.212
Gloria:
HE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL--
EXCEPT THAT BEARD.

56:55.279 --> 56:58.516
Maria:
THE BEARD IS GOOD--
IT HIDES THE SCAR.

56:58.583 --> 57:01.318
DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE HIM.

57:01.385 --> 57:02.653
WE GOT TO TALK.

57:02.720 --> 57:03.788
EXCUSE ME, MOM.

57:03.854 --> 57:05.022
GO AHEAD.

57:18.903 --> 57:20.170
LOCK THE DOOR.

57:25.610 --> 57:27.044
THE COPS KEPT THE VAN.

57:27.111 --> 57:28.378
OH, SHIT.

57:28.445 --> 57:30.047
FUCKING JOEY
AND HIS SUSPICIOUS MIND.

57:30.114 --> 57:31.716
DID YOU CLEAN IT GOOD?

57:31.782 --> 57:33.484
I SPENT TWO FUCKING HOURS.

57:33.551 --> 57:34.719
THERE'S NO BLOOD?

57:34.785 --> 57:35.886
IT'S SPOTLESS.

57:35.953 --> 57:37.488
BECAUSE COPS GOT EYES

57:37.555 --> 57:39.189
DOGS WITH NOSES
THAT SMELL EVERYTHING

57:39.256 --> 57:41.358
AND SCIENCE--
MR. FUCKING WIZARD!

57:41.425 --> 57:44.929
JOYCE, PLEASE,
YOU GOT TO CALM DOWN.

57:44.995 --> 57:48.398
I TOLD THE COPS SOMEBODY
BROKE INTO THE VAN

57:48.465 --> 57:50.267
STOLE ALL THE SHIT,
AND THEN WASHED IT OUT

57:50.334 --> 57:51.536
TO COVER UP
THE FINGERPRINTS.

57:51.602 --> 57:54.672
THIS WAY, THEY DON'T THINK
WE CLEANED IT.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.107
( knocking )

57:57.174 --> 57:58.743
Woman:
ANYBODY IN THERE?

58:01.345 --> 58:02.479
COME BACK LATER.

58:02.547 --> 58:03.881
IT'S CROWDED
IN HERE ALREADY.

58:03.948 --> 58:05.349
WHAT, EVERYBODY HAS TO GO
AT THE SAME TIME?

58:06.817 --> 58:09.520
AND FUCKING COOKIE TOO.
DID YOU TALK TO HER?

58:09.587 --> 58:10.688
NO.

58:10.755 --> 58:12.256
SHE DIDN'T EVEN COME.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.258
WHEN HER BROTHER
KILLED HIMSELF AND DIED

58:14.324 --> 58:16.426
I WAS A FRIEND TO HER.

58:16.493 --> 58:19.730
WELL, JIMMY DID SELL HIM
THAT BAD ACID.

58:19.797 --> 58:22.232
BAD ACID, MY ASS!

58:22.299 --> 58:24.268
PEOPLE HAVE TO GET
THEIR STORIES STRAIGHT.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.203
HER BROTHER WAS
ALWAYS DISTURBED.

58:26.270 --> 58:29.406
IF SHE OPENS HER MOUTH,
WE'LL GET CAUGHT.

58:29.473 --> 58:32.977
JOYCE, NO ONE'S
GETTING CAUGHT.

58:33.043 --> 58:34.945
YOU HAVE TO BE OPTIMISTIC.

58:35.012 --> 58:37.314
GRIEVING, BUT OPTIMISTIC.

58:37.381 --> 58:39.149
WHY, DO I LOOK GUILTY?

58:39.216 --> 58:41.686
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU LOOK MOURNFUL.

58:41.752 --> 58:43.087
YOU LOOK
HOW YOU SHOULD LOOK.

58:43.153 --> 58:44.421
MOURNFUL.

58:44.488 --> 58:45.923
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S
INSIDE YOUR MIND

58:45.990 --> 58:48.492
SO LET'S NOT TELL THEM.

58:48.559 --> 58:50.995
KEEP REMINDING ME,
BECAUSE I'M A SUCKY LIAR.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.897
YOU'RE A TERRIFIC LIAR.

58:52.963 --> 58:55.800
YOU'VE JUST LOST CONFIDENCE
IN YOURSELF.

58:57.434 --> 59:00.571
WELL, THERE'S CONFIDENCE
IN MYSELF NOW.

59:02.306 --> 59:03.608
WE GOT TO GET TO THE SHOP.

59:03.674 --> 59:05.610
YOU TAKE HIS WALLET
AND JEWELRY.

59:05.676 --> 59:08.646
I TOLD YOU TO GET RID
OF THAT SHIT!

59:08.713 --> 59:10.314
AW, JESUS!

59:10.380 --> 59:13.350
SHE WAS DUMPING OUT
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT COOKIE.

59:13.417 --> 59:15.085
I HAD DONE ENOUGH ALREADY.

59:15.152 --> 59:16.754
SO YOU REFUSED TO HELP HER?

59:16.821 --> 59:18.789
WELL, JOYCE CAN BE
VERY PERSUASIVE

59:18.856 --> 59:21.391
AND SHE DIDN'T TAKE "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER.

59:32.369 --> 59:34.138
WHAT THE HELL'S IN THIS?

59:34.204 --> 59:36.774
HIS WALLET, HIS JEWELRY,
AND HIS GUN.

59:36.841 --> 59:39.309
OH, JOYCE,
ENOUGH ALREADY.

59:39.376 --> 59:40.845
I CAN'T HAVE ANY GUNS.

59:41.846 --> 59:43.313
IT'S NOT EVEN REGISTERED.

59:43.380 --> 59:44.782
HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN IT?

59:44.849 --> 59:46.516
I GOT TO GET IT
OUT OF HERE.

59:46.583 --> 59:48.953
YOU COULD SEE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HER.

59:49.019 --> 59:51.388
SHE WAS TAKING PILLS
LEFT AND RIGHT.

59:51.455 --> 59:53.057
SHE WAS CRACKING UP.

59:53.123 --> 59:55.259
I THINK I HEAR HIM.

59:55.325 --> 59:58.796
LIKE, SOMETIMES

59:58.863 --> 01:00:02.466
I THINK I HEAR HIS VOICE
CALLING ME--

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:04.068
"JOYCIE."

01:00:05.903 --> 01:00:07.237
IT'S REALLY WEIRD

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:09.907
THE WAY THE MIND WORKS.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:11.575
YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

01:00:11.642 --> 01:00:14.378
AFTER THE FUNERAL,
YOU SHOULD TAKE A TRIP.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.313
GET AWAY FOR A WHILE.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.348
PUT THIS ALL BEHIND YOU.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.351
IN THE MEANTIME

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:23.220
YOU CAN'T KEEP PUTTING ME
IN THE MIDDLE HERE.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:26.423
I GOT TO KEEP IT
QUIET WITH ARTIE.

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:27.792
SO IF WE DON'T TALK
FOR A WHILE

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.259
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST,
ALL RIGHT?

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:33.230
JOYCE?

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.498
WHAT?

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.834
IT'S ALL RIGHT
IF WE DON'T TALK?

01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:39.236
YOU KNOW,
I AM SO EXHAUSTED

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.405
AND I CAN'T EVEN SLEEP.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:45.676
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:53.718
THEY HAVE CONCERNS--

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.285
YOU HAVE ANSWERS.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.954
THEY HAVE OBJECTIONS--

01:00:57.021 --> 01:01:00.124
YOU USE IT
AS BUYING SIGNALS.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.192
YOU MAKE THE DEAL.

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.361
YOU CLOSE THE DEAL.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:08.298
YOU CAN'T GIVE THEM
ENOUGH TIME TO THINK.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:10.267
YOU WOO THEM.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.269
YOU SELL THEM

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.238
AND SIGN THEM.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:16.974
CAVEAT EMPTOR.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.243
END OF STORY.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:20.745
Arthur:
CYNTHIA?

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:23.480
YEAH, ONLY ME.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.985
HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY, HEY.

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:31.756
A PERSON USUALLY SAYS,
"I'M HOME," OR SOMETHING.

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:33.057
WELL, I'M HOME.

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.759
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:36.460
NOTHING. WHY?

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.929
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE WAKE?

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.731
DID YOU TALK TO HER?

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:43.067
YEAH, I TALKED TO HER

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.502
AND I TOLD HER
NOT TO CALL ANYMORE

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.938
AND THAT I'M OUT OF IT.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.374
SID IS HERE.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.575
OH, GREAT.

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.778
I'LL GO SAY HELLO.

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:58.315
( babies crying )

01:01:58.382 --> 01:01:59.817
HI, BABIES.

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:02.920
COME HERE,
SWEETIE.

01:02:02.987 --> 01:02:04.755
HI, SIDNEY.
HOW ARE YOU?

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:06.857
THE QUESTION
IS HOW ARE YOU?

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:08.826
ARTIE TOLD ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:11.261
Cynthia:
HE DID?

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:14.799
YEAH, I TOLD HIM ABOUT JAMES--
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:16.767
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:21.071
SOMEBODY STOLE SOMETHING
AND LEFT HIM FOR DEAD
AND HE DIED.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:22.339
FUCKING ANIMALS.

01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:23.908
UH, YOU'LL EXCUSE
MY FRENCH.

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:27.344
THEY SHOULD LINE THEM ALL UP,
SLICE THEM OPEN

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:29.513
AND SPREAD
THEIR GUTS OUT.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.916
IT'S AN UGLY PICTURE,
I KNOW, BUT...

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.751
A YOUNG COUPLE, RIGHT?

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:36.253
DID THEY RENT OR OWN?

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.555
Arthur:
UH, THEY, UH...
THEY RENTED.

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:39.623
OOH!

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.858
BANG!

01:02:40.925 --> 01:02:42.592
UH, COME ON, HONEY.

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:45.896
LET'S GET READY FOR BED.

01:02:45.963 --> 01:02:47.631
HEY, HEY,
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:50.267
NOTHING. IT'S
JUST MY TAMPAX.

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:52.536
I'M GOING TO GET THE KIDS
READY FOR BED.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.703
COME ON, HONEY.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.205
GOOD NIGHT, SIDNEY.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.706
GOOD NIGHT.

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:00.710
FREAKIN' ANIMALS--
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.779
I KNOW.

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:04.548
KAVEET EMPTOR.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.884
CAVEAT EMPTOR.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:08.886
YEAH, RIGHT.

01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:23.333
OKAY.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.036
SO, SHE'S TAKEN
TO WOMEN'S DETENTION.

01:03:26.103 --> 01:03:27.804
Cynthia:
SHE SENT WORD
THROUGH HER FATHER

01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:30.274
THAT SHE WANTED TO SEE ME,
AND HE, UH... TOLD ME

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:33.610
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
SHE HAD WITH HER WRISTS.

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:38.715
HEY, JOYCE.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.750
HEY.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:43.888
UH...

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:45.422
( coughing )

01:03:48.092 --> 01:03:50.694
JOYCE, WHAT DID YOU
DO TO YOURSELF?

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.829
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:03.107
SOMEBODY'S TALKING.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.254
SO, WHAT?

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.788
SOMEBODY'S TALKING.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.959
THEY ASK QUESTIONS LIKE
SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING.

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:25.129
WELL, I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO THEM.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.530
NOT EVEN COOKIE?

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.198
NO. YOU KNOW COOKIE.

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:31.435
SHE'S OFF DYEING
HER HAIR GREEN,
HANGING OUT IN NEWARK

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.137
SCARED OF HER OWN SHADOW.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:36.840
IF SHE TALKS, THEY'LL
PUT YOU IN THE NEXT CELL.

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:38.075
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:40.444
KNOCK HER
OVER THE HEAD...

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.680
( coughing )

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:47.284
...WITH A FUCKING CLUB,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
THAT WILL SHUT HER UP.

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:50.955
JOYCE, LISTEN TO ME.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.923
YOU'VE GOT
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:54.891
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY STRONG.

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:57.227
YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.496
OR WE'LL KISS
OUR KIDS GOOD-BYE.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:01.031
( coughing )

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:08.605
Nealon:
ALL RIGHT.

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:11.942
THIS IS ABOUT GETTING
YOUR STORIES TOGETHER
ON THE VAN?

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:14.444
SO, LIKE I WAS TELLING
MISTER, UH...

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:16.246
KOLHATKAR.

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:20.750
YOU HAD THE VAN
ON, UH... MONDAY

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:23.988
TUESDAY AND, UH...
WEDNESDAY, RIGHT?

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:25.589
RIGHT.

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.924
AND THEN IT GOT
BROKEN INTO ON...

01:05:27.992 --> 01:05:29.926
THURSDAY.
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:31.428
THURSDAY.
THURSDAY.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.629
YEAH.

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:35.665
AND HOW DID YOU HOPE
TO VERIFY THIS?

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.102
WE KEEP A LOG OF EVERYTHING
AT THE SHOP.

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:39.769
THIS IS MY NUMBER.

01:05:39.836 --> 01:05:42.172
CAN I PICK IT UP TONIGHT?

01:05:42.239 --> 01:05:46.176
I WOULD RATHER GET IT
TO YOU TOMORROW.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.277
AS YOU WISH.

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:49.279
I WILL WAIT
TILL I HEAR FROM YOU.

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:54.418
DON'T WORRY.

01:05:56.186 --> 01:05:59.823
Nealon:
DID YOU DELIVER
THE LOG BOOK?

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:04.161
NO. I HAD TO GO TO WOOLWORTH'S
AND GET THE BOOKS.

01:06:04.228 --> 01:06:07.031
I HAD TO CHECK
FOR CONFLICTS.

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:09.266
THIS WAS A MUCH BIGGER JOB
THAN I EXPECTED.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:11.401
I HAVE TO STOP HERE.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.670
SOMETHING KEEPS BOTHERING ME.

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:17.374
DID YOU TELL YOUR HUSBAND
YOU WENT TO VISIT JOYCE?

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:18.575
NO.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:21.811
OR ABOUT THE LOG BOOK
AND CLEANING THE VAN?

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:23.347
NO.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:24.514
YOU SEE?

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.450
YOU SAID YOU TOLD
YOUR HUSBAND EVERYTHING

01:06:26.516 --> 01:06:29.919
ON THE NIGHT
JAMES WAS MURDERED.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.356
BUT NOW SOMETHING ELSE
IS HAPPENING.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:35.125
NOW YOU DON'T BRING HIM
UP TO DATE ANYMORE.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.027
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT?

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:40.664
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET HIM.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.399
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
I COULD DEAL WITH THIS.

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:44.268
NO, NO.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.836
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HERE.

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:50.374
JOYCE SUSPECTS
SOMEONE IS TALKING.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.176
YEAH, SHE'S
BEING PARANOID.

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:55.045
SHE SUSPECTS
SOMEONE IS TALKING.

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:56.480
MAYBE COOKIE.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:59.083
BUT SOMEBODY KNEW.
WHO KNEW?

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:04.221
YOU SEE, YOU'RE REALLY
CONFUSING ME NOW.

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.323
CYNTHIA, PLEASE.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.991
YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT GIRL.

01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:12.096
IT NEVER CROSSES YOUR MIND
THAT IT MIGHT BE ARTHUR
WHO'S TALKING?

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.930
ARTHUR KNEW.
YOU TOLD ARTHUR.

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:16.433
NEVER! ALL RIGHT?

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.102
HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:21.138
HIS CONCERN WAS FOR ME
AND THE KIDS.

01:07:21.205 --> 01:07:23.173
HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE ME.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.943
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE NOT
TRUSTING HIM ANYMORE.

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:30.580
I JUST WANTED
TO KEEP HIM OUT OF IT--

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.182
KEEP THE PEACE--

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:36.286
UNTIL THAT FUCKING LAWYER
CALLED.

01:07:38.122 --> 01:07:40.157
CYNTHIA, TELL US
ABOUT THAT.

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:46.663
IT WAS LATE.
I WAS WASHING THE DISHES.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:48.532
THE KIDS WERE ASLEEP.

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:52.969
I... I DIDN'T HEAR
THE PHONE RING.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:57.974
ARTHUR CAME UP BEHIND ME.

01:08:00.244 --> 01:08:02.312
YOU GOT A CALL TODAY
FROM YOUR FRIEND'S LAWYER.

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:03.480
HE SAID,
"YOU GOT A CALL TODAY

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.682
FROM YOUR FRIEND'S LAWYER."

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.985
HE WANTS THAT BOOK
YOU PROMISED HIM.

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:10.554
WHAT IS THIS?

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.988
I TOLD HIM TO GIVE IT TO ME.
IT DIDN'T CONCERN HIM.

01:08:13.157 --> 01:08:15.692
HE SAID, "BUT THIS IS A LIE."

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.594
IT'S FOR JOYCE'S DEFENSE.

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.462
WHY ARE YOU STILL
INVOLVED IN THIS?

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.930
IT'S TO SHOW THE VAN
WAS ROBBED.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:22.532
LISTEN TO ME, CYNTHIA.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.068
IF YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR NOSE UP HER BEHIND

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:27.237
YOU SHOULD JUST PACK YOUR BAGS
AND GO WITH HER.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.609
Woods:
SO YOU'RE HAVING PROBLEMS NOW.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:36.746
YOU'RE FIGHTING
OVER THIS THING.

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:39.683
WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING
THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE IT.

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:41.084
HE'S THREATENING YOU.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.019
NO, NO.

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:45.020
HE WAS WORRIED
ABOUT JOYCE.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:48.158
HE WAS MORE UPSET WITH HER
THAN HE WAS WITH ME.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:51.161
SHE REALLY NEEDED HELP--
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

01:08:51.228 --> 01:08:52.662
Woods:
AND DID SHE GET HELP?

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.096
NO, SHE GOT BAIL.

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:56.832
Jennifer:
HEY.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.702
ARE YOU WRAPPING HIM UP
LIKE A PRESENT?

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:00.404
( knocking )

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.872
I'M GOING TO GET THE DOOR.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.080
JOYCE?

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:12.881
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.751
ARTHUR'S GOING TO BE HOME
ANY MINUTE.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:16.786
I NEED THE GUN
AND THE JEWELRY.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:19.589
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.526
I'M AFRAID OF MY IN-LAWS.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.060
THEY'RE AFTER ME.

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:26.696
MAYBE YOU OUGHT
TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:29.131
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A GUN
IN YOUR FRAME OF MIND.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.801
NOBODY'S FOLLOWING
YOUR ASS ALL OVER TOWN.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:33.102
YOU'RE IN THE CLEAR.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.971
BUT IF I GO, SO HELP ME,
EVERYBODY'S GOING.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:39.209
JUST GIVE ME
WHAT I CAME FOR.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:41.978
THIS IS HOW
WE'LL GET CAUGHT--

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:43.779
WHEN WE TURN
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.582
I'M NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT PROTECTION

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.017
SO JUST DO THIS
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

01:09:49.786 --> 01:09:51.187
ALL RIGHT.

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:59.629
( baby gurgling )

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:04.133
Jennifer:
HEY!.. HEY, HEY.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.036
Baby:
HEY... DAA!

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:28.191
Jennifer:
DADDY!

01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:29.926
HEY, HOW'S MY LITTLE GIRL?

01:10:29.993 --> 01:10:31.094
COME TO DADDY.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.228
DADDY!

01:10:34.498 --> 01:10:36.500
OH, JOYCE!

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.402
I THOUGHT YOU WAS
GRETA GARBO THERE
FOR A MINUTE.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:41.237
ARTHUR.

01:10:41.305 --> 01:10:43.673
GO WATCH YOUR BROTHER,
HUH, HONEY?

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.074
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:47.243
THE INVESTIGATION
AND EVERYTHING?

01:10:47.311 --> 01:10:49.646
THOSE POLICE--
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:51.348
THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:52.616
THEY HAVE NO SUSPECTS?

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:54.851
WHO KNOWS?
THEY DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:57.354
BUT YOU THINK HE WAS ROBBED.

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:59.556
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURE.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:02.258
DIDN'T THEY ARREST YOU
OR SOMETHING?

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.661
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:07.631
JUST GOES TO SHOW
HOW STUPID THEY ARE.

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:11.501
BUT THEY
DON'T HAVE A CASE.
IT'S FALLING APART.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:14.404
Joyce:
THEY SHOULD FIND OUT
WHO REALLY DID IT.

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.105
WE'D ALL BE BETTER OFF.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.810
Arthur:
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN SOMEONE
WHO KNEW HIM?

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:23.313
WHO HAD A GRUDGE
OR SOMETHING?

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.281
YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY:

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:29.586
MOST MURDERS ARE COMMITTED
BY SOMEONE YOU KNOW.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:31.488
FAMILY, EVEN.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:34.524
OH, YEAH?

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:37.026
YEAH.

01:11:37.093 --> 01:11:40.196
WELL, IF YOU GOT ANY HUNCHES,
I'LL GIVE YOU THE NUMBER.

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:43.199
YOU CAN CALL
THE DETECTIVE YOURSELF.

01:11:43.266 --> 01:11:46.035
WELL, I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:51.975
UH, HERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR ANTHONY.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.176
THANKS.

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:55.244
SO, YOU GOT EVERYTHING
YOU WANT?

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:01.184
Joyce:
ARTHUR,

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.886
NICE SEEING YOU.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:04.287
BE WELL.

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:06.356
HEY, JOYCE, EVERYTHING'S
GOING TO WORK OUT.

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:07.591
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.926
I'M JUST GOING
TO WALK HER OUT.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.736
THAT FUCK THINKS
HE KNOWS SOMETHING.
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING?

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:21.438
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:23.473
YOU SEE THE WAY
HE LOOKED AT ME?

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.809
HE'S NEVER LIKED YOU,
SO WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.977
A LITTLE SYMPATHY.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:30.146
I AM THE FUCKING WIDOW,
YOU KNOW.

01:12:30.213 --> 01:12:31.981
SO, DO YOU WANT A MEDAL?

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:34.384
YOU CAN'T TRUST HIM BECAUSE
HE'D OPEN HIS MOUTH.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.185
HE WON'T OPEN HIS MOUTH.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.087
WHAT?

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.756
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:41.458
I WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:42.859
YOU THINK I TOLD HIM
I GOT MY PERIOD?

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:45.962
GEEZ!
THE MAN IS A THREAT.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.632
WE CAN'T AFFORD HIM
SAYING SOMETHING.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:51.134
I'D GET HIM FIRST
SO HELP ME GOD..!

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.302
JOYCE, YOU'RE
LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.472
YOU BETTER NOT BE
SCREWING ME OVER

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:58.642
'CAUSE SO HELP ME,
I'LL GET YOUR HUSBAND

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.612
I'LL GET YOUR CHILDREN,
AND I WILL FUCKING GET YOU!

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:03.913
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:05.782
I'M TIRED OF YOUR BULLSHIT!

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:07.250
IT'S FUCKING OVER!

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.719
YOU THINK IT'S OVER?

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:14.858
YOU GOT IT, BABY.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:18.027
GOOD BOY.
HAVE A COOKIE.
GOOD BOY.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:21.130
( door opens and closes )

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:22.466
HI, SWEET BOY.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:23.767
COME HERE.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:28.271
WHERE'S JENNIFER?

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:29.606
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

01:13:29.673 --> 01:13:33.109
SO WHAT ARE YOU TWO
CHATTING ABOUT, HUH?

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:35.111
NOTHING.
JUST TALKING.

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:37.947
SHE THINKS SHE'S
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:39.616
SHE'S NOT EVEN WORRIED.

01:13:39.683 --> 01:13:43.119
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT HER
NEAR THIS HOUSE

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:44.621
OR NEAR THE KIDS.

01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:49.826
ART, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I INVITED HER?

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:51.127
WHO YOU CALLING?

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:53.296
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:54.998
ARTHUR,
HANG UP THE PHONE.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:56.966
WE BEEN THROUGH THIS
LONG ENOUGH.

01:13:57.033 --> 01:13:58.835
I'M ENDING IT HERE AND NOW.

01:13:58.902 --> 01:14:00.470
LET'S NOT BE STUPID.

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:03.607
THAT WOMAN'S
A FUCKING MANIAC.

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.074
YOU DON'T GET INVOLVED
WITH HER!

01:14:05.141 --> 01:14:06.610
WHAT, YOU THINK YOU'RE
NOT INVOLVED IN THIS?

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.681
HUH? THINK ABOUT IT.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.218
YEAH, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:17.521
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT ALL RIGHT.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.938
HERE, COME ON.
LET'S GO IN THE BEDROOM.

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:36.239
WATCH YOUR
LITTLE BROTHER.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:37.841
MOMMY'S GOT TO TALK
TO DADDY.

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.892
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.161
I'M GOING TO GO SEE A LAWYER

01:14:58.227 --> 01:15:01.464
ABOUT A DIVORCE
AND A SEPARATION.

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:05.669
I'M SICK OF YOU
FAVORING HER OVER ME.
YOU ALWAYS DID.

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:07.436
ALL THESE YEARS, YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN MARRIED TO ME.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.472
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN MARRIED
TO EACH OTHER.

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:12.609
WELL, NOW YOU CAN HAVE HER
WITH MY BLESSINGS.

01:15:12.676 --> 01:15:15.144
THIS IS THE REAL BALLSY THING
TO DO--

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:18.682
THROW ME OUT WITH THE KIDS
WHEN WE NEED YOU THE MOST.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:20.984
NO, YOU GOT IT WRONG.
YOU GO.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.218
THE KIDS STAY WITH ME.

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:23.753
YOU'RE NOT FIT
TO BE THEIR MOTHER.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.923
AND YOU RAISE ONE FINGER
TO STOP ME

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:30.259
AND I WILL BURN YOU
AND YOUR FRIEND TOGETHER.

01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:32.361
YOU GOT THAT?

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:45.909
Woods:
SOUNDS LIKE JAMES AND JOYCE
OVER THERE.

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:50.479
NEVER LIKE THAT.
YOU HAVE TO READ
BETWEEN THE LINES.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.981
WHY DON'T YOU
HELP US OUT HERE

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.984
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.987
HE JUST WAS VERY FRUSTRATED
THAT I COULDN'T AVOID HER.

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.190
BUT HE'S BLAMING YOU
FOR THAT.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.728
JESUS! I TELL YOU ONE FIGHT,
YOU MAKE IT MY WHOLE LIFE.

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:08.031
HE JUST WAS TAKING
HIS FRUSTRATIONS OUT ON ME.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:09.833
COUPLES SAY THINGS
TO HURT EACH OTHER

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:11.567
WHEN THEY'RE HAVING
AN ARGUMENT.

01:16:11.635 --> 01:16:15.639
THEN THEY MAKE UP.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:16:15.705 --> 01:16:19.743
OH, SO HE'S NOT BLAMING YOU,
OR ATTACKING YOU.

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:21.510
HE'S ACTUALLY
COMING TO YOUR RESCUE.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.546
( imitates bugle charge )

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.549
I WOULDN'T MAKE FUN.

01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:28.351
BUT HE'S THROWING YOU OUT.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.790
AND YOU GOT JOYCE
MAKING LIKE POCAHONTAS.

01:16:33.857 --> 01:16:36.059
YOU'RE REALLY CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE.
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:37.293
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.895
I MADE MY CHOICE.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.831
I TOLD MY HUSBAND
MY PLACE WAS WITH HIM.

01:16:41.898 --> 01:16:44.801
I WASN'T GOING TO DESTROY
MY MARRIAGE OVER THIS.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:46.435
THEN WHERE WOULD I BE?

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:50.674
I THOUGHT IF THEY
CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.010
THAT I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY
THE TRUTH, AND THAT'S IT.

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:56.545
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU DO THAT?

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.483
NOBODY ASKED.

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:05.789
NOBODY ASKED?

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.094
NOT UNTIL, UH...

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:18.935
THEY FOUND MY HUSBAND'S BODY.

01:17:19.002 --> 01:17:21.437
COULDN'T YOU HAVE
PICKED UP A QUARTER
AND CALLED SOMEBODY?

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:23.873
( clears throat )

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:31.815
Nealon:
OKAY, ON THE DAY
YOUR HUSBAND WAS KILLED

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:36.519
THE FIRST THING YOU DID
THAT MORNING WAS WHAT?

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.760
I KISSED MY HUSBAND GOOD-BYE.

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:53.202
AFTER HE LEFT,
I TOOK THE KIDS AND, UH...

01:17:54.704 --> 01:17:56.940
LEFT THE HOUSE.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:00.309
EVERY DAY I WOULD GO
BY MY MOTHER'S,
OR MY SISTER'S--

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:02.578
ANYPLACE TO AVOID JOYCE.

01:18:03.947 --> 01:18:07.016
( girls giggling )

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:13.156
( phone ringing )

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.323
HELLO?

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:15.524
Could I speak with Cynthia?

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:16.625
WHO'S THIS?

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:17.761
Uh, Joyce.

01:18:17.827 --> 01:18:19.295
HOLD ON.

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:22.198
-CYN, TELEPHONE.
-WHO IS IT?

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:25.168
IT'S YOUR FRIEND. JOYCE.

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:28.972
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.941
THIS BABY'S SOAKING WET.

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:33.442
CYN, WHERE ARE
THE DIAPERS?

01:18:33.509 --> 01:18:34.944
I... I DON'T KNOW, MA.

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:37.480
LAUREN, GET MA ONE
OF YOUR DIAPERS, OKAY?

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.448
WATCH MY SAUCE.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.951
Yeah, I'm here.

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:45.288
CYNTHIA, I DON'T HEAR
FROM YOU--
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK?

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.623
LISTEN, THINK
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:50.994
SO YOU GOING HOME, OR WHAT?

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.063
No, I'm going to be here
a while.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.466
IS ARTHUR WITH YOU?

01:18:57.533 --> 01:19:00.669
NO, HE'S HOME.
I'M WITH THE KIDS. WHY?

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:07.576
NOW THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:10.746
YOU SAY SHE'S GOT
IT IN FOR YOU,
GOT IT IN FOR ARTHUR

01:19:10.814 --> 01:19:13.783
THEN YOU GIVE HER THIS
INFORMATION THAT
HE'S HOME ALONE

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:16.385
AND YOU'RE WAY OVER
AT YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:18.121
WHICH GIVES HER
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:21.424
TO GO AND DO WHATEVER IT IS
SHE'D LIKE TO DO.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.060
WEREN'T YOU SUSPICIOUS
OF HER QUESTIONS?

01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:26.429
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT ARTHUR?

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:29.999
YOU SPILLED YOUR
GUTS TO ARTHUR

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:32.101
AND NOW HE'S TRYING
TO PULL SOMETHING.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:37.073
SHE'S CONCERNED AGAIN NOW
THAT ARTHUR IS SETTING HER UP.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.944
I TOLD HER HE
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.
HE WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:45.214
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
ARTHUR'S HAD IT IN FOR ME
FROM WAY BACK.

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.250
THE PAST HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:50.319
I'm going over there
and find out what was said.

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:53.089
If I don't like what I hear,
I'll set things straight.

01:19:53.156 --> 01:19:55.124
DON'T START WITH ARTIE.

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:57.093
HE WON'T STAND FOR THIS SHIT.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.129
I'M NOT GOING TO START
WITH ARTIE.

01:20:00.196 --> 01:20:01.965
I'M GOING TO FINISH
WITH ARTIE.

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:05.601
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
JUST THREATENING ME.

01:20:05.668 --> 01:20:08.571
Nealon:
DID YOU THINK SHE WOULD
JUST TALK TO HIM?

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.739
GO OVER AND THREATEN HIM?

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.878
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I THOUGHT SHE WOULD DO.

01:20:14.944 --> 01:20:16.279
YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:19.282
YEAH. I'M JUST REALLY TIRED,
THAT'S ALL.

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:21.918
WELL, DON'T DRINK
TOO MUCH, OKAY?

01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:22.952
OKAY.

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:24.220
GIVE ME A KISS.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.322
-BYE, SWEETIE.
-COME ON, BABY.

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:34.830
Woods:
HOW LONG DID YOU SLEEP FOR?

01:20:34.898 --> 01:20:36.265
COUPLE OF HOURS--

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.367
TILL MY FATHER
CAME IN AND WOKE ME.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:39.468
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.171
CYNTHIA, HEY.

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:43.606
COME ON, HONEY.

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.374
OH...

01:20:45.441 --> 01:20:47.143
DAD, WHAT TIME IS IT?

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:48.477
IT'S ALMOST 11:30.

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:50.113
COME UPSTAIRS
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.680
DID, UM... ARTIE CALL?

01:20:51.747 --> 01:20:53.349
NO.

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:55.651
WHY DON'T YOU GO
GET SOME SLEEP?

01:20:55.718 --> 01:20:57.486
NO. I SHOULD GO ON HOME.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:20:59.022
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE YOU?

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.891
-YEAH. THE KIDS STILL ASLEEP?
-YEAH, SURE, THEY'RE FINE.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:04.060
YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO GO HOME?

01:21:04.793 --> 01:21:07.196
YEAH, I'M SURE.

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:08.898
Wood:
YOUR FATHER DRIVES YOU HOME.

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.234
DO YOU EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS
TO HIM?

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.002
I TOLD HIM I THOUGHT
IT WAS STRANGE

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:14.603
THAT ARTHUR
DIDN'T CALL ME BACK.

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:17.240
HE SAID I PROBABLY JUST
SLEPT THROUGH THE CALL

01:21:17.306 --> 01:21:19.575
AND MAYBE ARTHUR
FELL ASLEEP.
I DON'T KNOW.

01:21:19.642 --> 01:21:21.544
Wood: BUT YOU KNEW BETTER.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.213
NO, I JUST KNEW
SOMETHING WAS UP
WHEN I SAW THE LIGHTS.

01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:13.889
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME WATER?

01:23:13.956 --> 01:23:15.658
PLEASE.

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:16.825
OKAY.

01:23:27.570 --> 01:23:28.971
THANK YOU.

01:23:37.113 --> 01:23:39.615
DO YOU FEEL ABLE
TO CONTINUE?

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:41.650
ALL RIGHT.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:43.852
LET ME SAY, CINDY,
YOU KNOW

01:23:43.919 --> 01:23:48.357
I DO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT
THIS ORDEAL HAS BEEN FOR YOU

01:23:48.424 --> 01:23:52.461
HOW HARD IT IS FOR YOU
TO STEP FORWARD
AND MAKE THIS STATEMENT

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:55.398
BUT SOMETHING JUST
DOESN'T SIT RIGHT HERE.

01:23:56.932 --> 01:23:58.367
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU.

01:23:58.434 --> 01:24:01.770
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING--
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.

01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:05.508
NOW, ON THE DAY ARTHUR
IS KILLED

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:06.942
YOU WENT TO
YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE

01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:08.777
BECAUSE YOU
WANTED TO BE SAFE.

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:10.713
AND I WANTED TO SEE MY MOTHER.

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:12.515
YES, YES, IT'S A GOOD TIME

01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:15.084
THE RIGHT TIME,
TO VISIT YOUR MOTHER.

01:24:15.151 --> 01:24:17.353
JOYCE CALLS.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:19.021
HER FUSE IS STILL BURNING.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.657
SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING
TO SHUT ARTHUR UP.

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:24.293
I TOLD HER ARTHUR
WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.230
I TRUSTED HIM.
HE WOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING.

01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:30.433
YOU'RE PLEADING WITH HER
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

01:24:30.499 --> 01:24:31.834
I WAS DEFENDING HIM.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.770
AND THEN, AFTER EVERYTHING
JOYCE HAS DONE--

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:37.173
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
SHE'S CAPABLE OF--

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.808
YOU GO TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH?

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:42.211
WELL, I WAS DRINKING,
AND NODDED OFF.

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:44.480
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:47.350
WELL, EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.218
THERE'S A KILLER ON A RAMPAGE

01:24:49.285 --> 01:24:51.053
THREATENING
TO GET YOUR HUSBAND

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.088
AND YOU NOD OFF?

01:24:53.156 --> 01:24:55.758
NOW YOU TELL ME
IF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE.

01:24:57.126 --> 01:25:00.363
YOU TELL ME
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.166
WELL, IT...
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:06.635
BECAUSE I
SHOULD HAVE WENT HOME.

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:08.971
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEBODY.

01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:11.140
WHO DO YOU TELL?
WHO DO YOU WARN?

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:14.443
NO. THERE'S GOT
TO BE A REASON.

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:16.078
YOU COME IN HERE,
YOU TALK ABOUT JOYCE

01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:20.048
BUT YOU KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
YOU LET IT HAPPEN.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.418
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
OR GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:24.487
YOU'RE ASKING US
TO ACCEPT TOO MUCH.

01:25:24.553 --> 01:25:26.088
IF JOYCE WASN'T A MURDERER

01:25:26.155 --> 01:25:27.890
IF JOYCE HADN'T
SLAUGHTERED JAMES

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:31.494
THEN I'D BE SAYING, "MAYBE.
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T REALIZE."

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.761
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:36.999
YOU MAKE HER MORE ANGRY.

01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:41.304
YOU THREW IT
IN HER FACE.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:42.905
YOU MADE HER FURIOUS.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.276
I'M NOT SURE
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS 100% TRUE.

01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:50.446
I'M NOT SURE THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS 100% TRUE.

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:53.482
I THINK YOU WANTED HIM DEAD.

01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:55.518
THAT'S A GODDAMN LIE!

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:58.120
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS GOING
TO GIVE YOU UP

01:25:58.187 --> 01:25:59.955
AS JOYCE'S ACCOMPLICE,
TAKE THE KIDS

01:26:00.022 --> 01:26:01.757
AND SHIP YOU OFF
FOR THE DURATION.

01:26:01.824 --> 01:26:03.659
THAT'S BULLSHIT!

01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:05.728
I JUST...

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:07.796
YOU ALLOWED
THIS CRAZY WOMAN

01:26:07.863 --> 01:26:11.166
TO GO AND BLOW HIS HEAD OFF

01:26:11.234 --> 01:26:13.101
SO YOU CAN'T EVEN OPEN
THE COFFIN AT THE FUNERAL.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.504
THE FATHER OF YOUR KIDS.

01:26:15.571 --> 01:26:17.373
THE MAN YOU
TOOK VOWS WITH.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.442
THE GUY YOU SHARED
YOUR BED WITH.

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:21.277
HOW DARE YOU JUDGE ME?

01:26:21.344 --> 01:26:23.746
I NEVER WANTED ANYBODY HURT.

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:25.248
YOU WANTED IT THEN.

01:26:25.314 --> 01:26:26.749
YOU'RE TWISTING THINGS
AROUND ON ME!

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:28.150
YOU FIXED IT WITH JOYCE
TO FINISH HIM!

01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:30.786
YOU GAVE HER THE GUN,
FOR CHRIST SAKES!

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.089
SHE WAS... I THOUGHT SHE
WAS JUST BULLSHITTING.

01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.891
I... I CALLED HER BLUFF.

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:37.726
AFTER ALL THIS WHILE?

01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:39.328
JAMES'S BRUTAL MURDER?

01:26:39.395 --> 01:26:40.763
ALL HER THREATS?

01:26:40.829 --> 01:26:42.064
SHE CALLS YOU UP

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.066
AND SAYS SHE'S
GOING TO KILL ARTHUR

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:46.235
AND YOU THINK SHE'S BLUFFING?

01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:48.771
I MEAN,
THE WOMAN'S A MURDERER!

01:26:50.005 --> 01:26:52.741
YOU'RE TELLING ME
SHE'S A MUR..!

01:27:07.656 --> 01:27:10.826
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
SHE ISN'T A MURDERER.

01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:14.129
SHE IS A MURDERER.

01:27:14.196 --> 01:27:16.198
SHE KILLED MY HUSBAND.

01:27:18.401 --> 01:27:20.669
SHE DESTROYED...

01:27:21.937 --> 01:27:25.541
THE ONLY THING IN LIFE
THAT MATTERED TO ME.

01:27:25.608 --> 01:27:27.876
WELL, YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

01:27:28.544 --> 01:27:30.212
THAT I BELIEVE.

01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:34.983
THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SITTING HERE.

01:27:35.050 --> 01:27:36.619
BUT THE DAY ARTHUR
WAS KILLED

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:40.188
YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T BELIEVE HER.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:45.394
YOU SAID, A MOMENT AGO,
YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS BLUFFING.

01:27:46.529 --> 01:27:49.832
WHICH BRINGS ME
RIGHT BACK TO... JAMES

01:27:49.898 --> 01:27:52.234
AND WHAT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME

01:27:52.301 --> 01:27:54.637
ABOUT THIS WHOLE STORY.

01:27:56.972 --> 01:27:59.375
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:04.012
WELL, YOU SEE

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:07.249
JOYCE THREATENED FOR YEARS
TO GET RID OF HER HUSBAND

01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:09.618
BUT YOU NEVER TOOK IT
SERIOUSLY.

01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:13.055
EVERY TIME JOYCE CALLED,
YOU JUMPED--

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:17.092
THE VAN, THE LOG BOOK,
JAMES' PERSONAL EFFECTS

01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:20.195
THE GUN, THE WHOLE COVER-UP.

01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:25.200
I THOUGHT
I WAS PROTECTING HER

01:28:25.868 --> 01:28:27.836
HELPING HER.

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.808
THAT JUST DOESN'T WASH,
CYNTHIA.

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:35.578
YOU CAN SEE THAT WHEN I
LAY IT OUT FOR YOU.

01:28:39.448 --> 01:28:41.384
WHY DOES A YOUNG WOMAN--
A MOTHER--

01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:43.251
RISK EVERYTHING IN LIFE

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:44.987
FOR A FRIEND
WHO'S TORMENTING HER?

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:46.389
THAT WHOLE TIME,
YOU DIDN'T ACT

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:48.791
LIKE JOYCE
WAS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY.

01:28:48.857 --> 01:28:51.894
YOU WERE ACTING LIKE SHE
WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING--

01:28:53.429 --> 01:28:55.831
SOMETHING SHE HAD OVER YOU.

01:28:57.299 --> 01:28:58.867
SOMETHING YOU DID.

01:28:59.535 --> 01:29:01.637
WHAT YOU WANT IS A LIE.

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:03.872
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:08.377
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT
BECAUSE I'M NOT SAYING
SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO.

01:29:08.444 --> 01:29:10.579
SOMETHING THAT
IS A FUCKING LIE.

01:29:11.447 --> 01:29:12.915
OKAY?

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:17.520
YEAH, YOU LIE TO ME.

01:29:17.586 --> 01:29:19.021
I WANT A LIE.

01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:24.893
BRING IN MRS. URBANSKI.

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:33.235
OKAY, CYNTHIA.

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:36.104
I'M NOT GOING
TO LOCK YOU UP
RIGHT NOW.

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:40.042
YOUR KIDS NEED A MOMMY
MORE THAN I NEED AN ARREST.

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:45.047
I'M GOING TO LET YOU GO HOME.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:48.350
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

01:29:50.453 --> 01:29:52.488
LET ME WALK YOU OUT.

01:30:06.602 --> 01:30:08.003
CINDY...

01:30:09.672 --> 01:30:13.108
YOU KNOW, I'M IN
A REAL TOUGH SPOT HERE.

01:30:15.544 --> 01:30:17.379
I GET THE PRIVILEGE
OF GOING BACK IN THERE

01:30:17.446 --> 01:30:18.681
AND, UH...

01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:21.383
ORPHANING JOYCE'S SON.

01:30:23.519 --> 01:30:27.623
BUT, YOU KNOW...
THEN AGAIN, THE TRUTH
IS NEVER EASY, IS IT?

01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:31.960
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:39.728
( carnival sounds )

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:05.854
Cynthia:
JIMMY?

01:32:06.955 --> 01:32:08.456
JIMMY?

01:32:19.702 --> 01:32:22.437
( groans )

01:32:22.504 --> 01:32:25.440
AH, JIM,
GIVE ME THESE KEYS.

01:32:25.507 --> 01:32:27.409
COME ON.

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:28.410
NO, DON'T.

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:29.578
DON'T JOSTLE ME.

01:32:31.313 --> 01:32:32.615
COME ON.

01:32:35.117 --> 01:32:37.285
I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.355
HEY!

01:32:42.157 --> 01:32:45.027
HEY, COME ON.

01:32:45.093 --> 01:32:48.063
COME ON,
LEAVE OFF, JIMMY.

01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:49.464
STOP IT.

01:32:49.531 --> 01:32:52.467
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LAY DOWN.

01:32:54.236 --> 01:32:55.604
COME ON.

01:32:55.671 --> 01:32:57.005
JIMMY, LET GO.

01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:58.206
COME ON.

01:32:58.273 --> 01:32:59.541
LAY DOWN WITH ME.

01:32:59.608 --> 01:33:01.043
I DON'T WANT TO LAY DOWN
WITH YOU.

01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:03.345
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.280
JUST LAY DOWN
FOR A SECOND.

01:33:05.347 --> 01:33:07.249
JESUS!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:33:07.315 --> 01:33:08.651
NO, I DON'T..!

01:33:10.853 --> 01:33:11.920
HEY!

01:33:12.354 --> 01:33:14.957
NO! NO!

01:33:16.725 --> 01:33:17.960
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

01:33:18.694 --> 01:33:19.762
NO, JIMMY...

01:33:19.828 --> 01:33:21.664
Jimmy:
JUST FUCKING RELAX!

01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:23.531
( sobbing )

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:25.567
SHUT UP!

01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:34.777
NO!

01:33:34.843 --> 01:33:37.179
NO, NO, NO...

01:33:42.651 --> 01:33:44.052
JIMMY...

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:48.991
( gasps and cries )

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:20.182
WHOO, WHOO, WHOO!
I AM WINNING!

01:35:20.248 --> 01:35:22.751
YES, I WON! WHAT?

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:26.789
ALL RIGHT.

01:35:27.322 --> 01:35:28.423
HE'S BLEEDING.

01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:30.225
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL SAVE HIM.

01:35:30.292 --> 01:35:31.726
LET'S JUST...

01:35:32.995 --> 01:35:34.462
JIMMY?

01:35:34.529 --> 01:35:35.730
( groan )

01:35:35.798 --> 01:35:37.665
( gasps )

01:35:39.835 --> 01:35:41.603
SHIT!

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.772
CYNTHIA,
HE'S BLEEDING ALL OVER.

01:35:45.173 --> 01:35:46.341
LET ME SEE.

01:35:46.408 --> 01:35:49.144
NO! HE'S OUT.

01:35:49.211 --> 01:35:51.113
HE'S ASLEEP.

01:35:51.179 --> 01:35:53.115
ASLEEP?
OR UNCONSCIOUS?

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:54.950
BECAUSE IF HE'S ASLEEP,
WE CAN WAKE HIM UP.

01:35:55.017 --> 01:35:56.418
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

01:35:57.385 --> 01:35:58.854
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

01:35:58.921 --> 01:36:00.322
WE'LL GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:36:00.388 --> 01:36:01.957
HE'LL GET A TRANSFUSION.

01:36:02.024 --> 01:36:03.458
HE'LL BE FINE.

01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:16.972
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?
LET'S GO! LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:20.308
COME ON!
COME ON!

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:37.459
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT HIM.

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:38.861
I'M SO SORRY.

01:36:38.927 --> 01:36:41.897
HE JUST LEFT ME NO CHOICE.

01:36:41.964 --> 01:36:43.731
JOYCE, I'M GOING TO GO
TO JAIL FOR THIS.

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:45.067
I CAN'T GO TO JAIL.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:46.601
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF MY KIDS?

01:36:46.668 --> 01:36:48.636
SHIT! DID HE TRY
TO FUCK YOU?

01:36:48.703 --> 01:36:50.038
JOYCE, PLEASE DON'T.

01:36:50.105 --> 01:36:51.773
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

01:36:56.678 --> 01:36:58.280
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:36:58.346 --> 01:37:00.315
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:37:00.382 --> 01:37:02.550
THE HOSPITAL'S THE OTHER WAY.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:07.222
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

01:37:09.057 --> 01:37:10.758
JOYCE?

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.527
WE GOT TO TURN AROUND.

01:37:12.594 --> 01:37:13.962
WE GOT TO TURN...

01:37:14.029 --> 01:37:15.097
WHAT THE FUCK?

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:16.264
TURN AROUND.

01:37:21.003 --> 01:37:22.905
WHAT THE FUCK'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

01:37:22.971 --> 01:37:24.039
WHAT IF THEY
DON'T BELIEVE US?

01:37:24.106 --> 01:37:26.774
WHAT IF JIMMY
WAKES UP?

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:29.011
WE GOT TO STICK
TOGETHER.

01:37:29.077 --> 01:37:31.446
IT IS TOO LATE.

01:37:33.081 --> 01:37:35.951
WE ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE HIM SOMEWHERE

01:37:37.285 --> 01:37:39.821
AND LEAVE HIM.

01:37:39.888 --> 01:37:41.756
OH... OH...

01:38:04.746 --> 01:38:06.348
OH, MY GOD!

01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:09.717
OH, MY GOD!

01:38:12.487 --> 01:38:14.389
WHAT AM I DOING?

01:38:15.857 --> 01:38:17.993
WHAT AM I DOING?

01:39:52.154 --> 01:39:53.755
Woods:
READY?

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.323
LET'S GET STARTED.
