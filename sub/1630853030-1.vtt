01:54.740 --> 01:59.578
They mad right now
'cause I put you in charge of my affairs.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.373
But in the long run,

02:05.083 --> 02:08.502
they're gonna be better off
because of your strength.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.182
I'm-- I'm sorry
for what's about to happen here today.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.187
But I got to set things right.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.567
That-- That motherfucker got to pay
for what he done.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.073
I know you in there, old man.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.788
-Who is it?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.950
Boy, you stop playing around.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.077
Do what you promised.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.872
I… I forgot.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.040
Forgot?

04:52.251 --> 04:54.920
I didn't give my life for you to forget.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.055
-Get her out of there!
-Come on! Come on!

05:51.435 --> 05:52.936
Mama.

Mama.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.026

-Yes, baby?

06:00.736 --> 06:03.697

Well, come on in.

06:10.746 --> 06:13.999
Take a chair at the table.
I just made a mess of grits.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.585
Thank you.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.394
Papa Grey.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.230
Get him!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.523
Papa Grey!

06:45.906 --> 06:47.866
Papa Grey, you in there?

06:48.492 --> 06:49.493
Papa Grey.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.079
To make these,
we're gonna start with protein…

06:54.331 --> 06:55.624
Papa Grey?

06:55.707 --> 06:56.834
Who that?

06:57.668 --> 06:58.752
It's me.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.004
Me? I'm me.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.465
Is you that woman who wanna rob me?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.133
No.

07:05.217 --> 07:08.762
I'm that man that's telling you
that I'm here and that it's me, Reggie.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.639
Reggie?

07:10.722 --> 07:12.808
How I know it's you?

07:12.891 --> 07:14.226
You know my voice.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.980
I know the voice
if I see the face who talking.

07:18.063 --> 07:21.191
But, you know, sometimes--
Sometimes I don't know, you know?

07:21.275 --> 07:24.111
Okay, okay.
So how I'ma prove to you that I'm me?

07:26.196 --> 07:28.615
Well, what I always tell Reggie
he got to do?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.786
I got to take care of my kids.

07:32.870 --> 07:35.122
I got to go to the doctor
if I run a fever.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.250
And-- I got to put in
at least ten dollars in the bank

07:38.333 --> 07:39.459
every time I get paid.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.003
Well, anybody know that.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.422
What I tell Reggie about drinking?

07:44.214 --> 07:46.341
You say, "Don't do it. Don't do it.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.886
'Cause when you do, you like to get mad."

07:49.678 --> 07:51.263
That shit don't sound nothing like me.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.598
Papa Grey, open up.

08:04.067 --> 08:07.446
Told you. Good to see you, Papa Grey.

08:07.529 --> 08:10.157
All right. Right. Here we go.
Work with me.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.493
Hey! There you go. All right now.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.663
-And?
-Always--

08:16.747 --> 08:19.082
-Always lock the door.
-Always lock that door.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.460
You don't want that woman coming back
and robbing you again.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.379
Uh-uh. No, Lord. She slapped me down.

08:24.463 --> 08:29.134
Stole my-- Stole my change can and--

08:29.218 --> 08:32.221
Yeah, yeah. That's okay, Unc.
Hey, you got some ice water I could drink?

08:33.222 --> 08:34.640
Ice water, to drink?

08:35.474 --> 08:37.142
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.769
Come on. Come on, man.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.980
You get the pitcher out the icebox here.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.066
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna find your special glass

08:44.149 --> 08:47.152
I always keep for you to, you know,
drink your water out of 'cause--

08:47.236 --> 08:49.029
Yeah. How's the hand?

08:49.112 --> 08:52.407
It's got a big old bandage on it,
but it's-- It's aight.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.494
I'ma find that glass,
'cause I know how you like your water,

08:55.577 --> 08:58.372
so I've always keeped your special glass
in a special place.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.793
You done ate three cans of beans
in three days, Uncle. That's good.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.419
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.088
Three cans ago, when you was here,

09:06.171 --> 09:07.589
-I washed the glass…
-Okay.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.925
…so it'd be ready for you when you came.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.555
Where-- Where's--

09:15.138 --> 09:17.432
-What is that?
-I can't remember where.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.602
Why you got the alarm clock
in the icebox, Papa Grey?

09:21.353 --> 09:26.191
I-- I wanted to know what
the temperature was, so I-- I was--

09:26.275 --> 09:29.152
I think this would do you better
by your sleeping table. What you think?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.196
Yeah.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.322
Yeah?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.574
Okay. All right.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.534
All right.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.414
You put that up there, didn't you?

09:40.497 --> 09:41.874
Because I know I didn't.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.294
You're something else.

09:45.377 --> 09:48.463
We've got a high-pressure system
that could very likely…

09:48.547 --> 09:51.758
I had a visitor
just before you got here, but--

09:52.551 --> 09:54.720
but that-- that was--
that was a long time ago.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.097
And then-- then you showed up.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.183
They came inside?

10:00.851 --> 10:02.019
Well, who was it?

10:03.187 --> 10:04.646
A man I used to know.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.607
What man?

10:06.690 --> 10:07.941
You know what man.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.694
One of them niggas hang out
up on the corner?

10:14.239 --> 10:16.783
No-- No-- No. It's--

10:16.867 --> 10:20.162
It-- It's-- It's-- It's--
It's somebody from before your time.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.789
-Who was?
-Coydog.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.834
Man who taught me my figures, how to read.

10:25.918 --> 10:29.338
Yeah. Okay. Coydog, huh?

10:29.421 --> 10:32.174
You talking about the old days.
Uh-huh. Okay.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.470
There was a fight somewhere out there too,

10:36.553 --> 10:40.891
'cause-- 'cause I heard a lot-- a whole--
whole bunch of clanging, you know.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.144
Them cowbells-- cowbells was ringing.

10:46.897 --> 10:48.607
Do you want some water, Papa Grey?

11:07.125 --> 11:10.295
I think we're gonna have to shape you up
before we present you to the world, Uncle.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.298
No, no. l-- I-- I like it like this.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.009
Yeah.

11:16.093 --> 11:19.304
Got a little Frederick Douglass going.
Let me help you out.

11:24.685 --> 11:29.022
So like I was saying, Unc, Nina,
she ain't too happy around here no more.

11:30.566 --> 11:34.194
So, I was thinking of packing her
and the kids up

11:34.278 --> 11:36.864
and moving on down to Texas.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.407
Yeah. All right.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.118
What you think about that?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.288
Think it'd be all right if somebody else
came to check on you from time to time?

11:44.913 --> 11:47.040
Yeah. Yeah. The more the better.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.678
What's wrong with that woman, Reggie?
Over there.

11:59.761 --> 12:00.762
Lower your voice.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.681
You see she got
that big old lump on her neck

12:02.764 --> 12:04.266
like a head about to grow out of it?

12:04.349 --> 12:05.350
What's wrong with her?

12:05.434 --> 12:07.603
Nothing wrong with her, Papa Grey.
Just be quiet.

12:07.686 --> 12:10.606
Why I got to be quiet when she got
something that look like a big grapefruit

12:10.689 --> 12:11.815
about to bust out of her neck?

12:11.899 --> 12:13.317
-I wanna know what's wrong with her.
-Ptolemy?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.401
-Don't you?
-Ptolemy Grey?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.653
Yes, ma'am. Come on, Unc.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.198
-What?
-Let's go to the doctor.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.993
-You need to shut him up.
-I'm so sorry.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.203
What she say?

12:24.286 --> 12:25.662
Why you got me in here

12:25.746 --> 12:28.415
when that woman out yonder
with that big old thing on her throat?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.000
Well, that's, Ms. Pine,

12:30.083 --> 12:33.128
and she's got what we call a goiter
and a thyroid infection.

12:33.212 --> 12:35.422
And we're just prepping her
for a trip to the hospital.

12:35.506 --> 12:40.052
You know, Coydog used to say
hospital where Black folk went to die.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.388
Well, as a resident
I practically lived in a hospital,

12:43.472 --> 12:45.057
and somehow I made it out alive.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.975
Yeah, but you ain't but so Black.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.313
Hand's completely healed. It's amazing.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.732
Told ya.
Ain't nobody sticking needles in me,

12:53.815 --> 12:56.068
wrapping my hand up
like it's a ornery hog.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.361
Well, Mr. Grey…

12:57.444 --> 12:59.780
People your age, with a burn like that,

12:59.863 --> 13:01.532
would take months to heal.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.616
No, I heal fast.

13:02.699 --> 13:06.620
Old Black man in the cotton fields,
he can't be playin' sick.

13:07.579 --> 13:12.709
Once upon a time I could pick
300 pounds of cotton on a summer day.

13:12.793 --> 13:16.755
Them other niggas be passing out
in the dirt from the heat.

13:16.839 --> 13:17.881
Not me.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.260
I worked till the June moon come up.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.719
The June moon.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.222
The way they tell the story
is that he was only 12

13:25.305 --> 13:27.558
when he came up from the Delta up north.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.893
-He walked barefoot--
-Uh-uh! I ran.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.436
He r--

13:31.520 --> 13:32.980
Mr. Grey.

13:33.063 --> 13:36.191
Do you remember when I used to live
in your building when I was a kid?

13:38.986 --> 13:40.320
No.

13:40.404 --> 13:43.365
You don't remember when I used to
trick-or-treat by your apartment door

13:43.448 --> 13:45.450
and you-- you'd give out apples.

13:45.534 --> 13:46.952
-Apples?
-Yeah.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.163
No.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.457
Come on, Papa Grey. You remember.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.294
Remember what?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.047
Excuse me one second.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.092
-Ms.-- Ms. Kamal?
-Yes, Doctor?

14:02.176 --> 14:04.428
Mr. Grey, would you like a pop?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.762
Dr Pepper?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.890
A Dr Pepper? You got it.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.976
Mrs. Kamal, could you please take Mr. Grey
to the snack room

14:11.059 --> 14:12.102
-and get him a Dr Pepper?
-Yes.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.187
Yep, I got you.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.063
Come with me now, honey.
We'll get you a soda.

14:15.147 --> 14:16.690
-All right.
-You coming?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.692
No, I'ma talk to him for a minute.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.486
You know what he's gonna tell you, right?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.198
You need to lose some weight.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.916
He's slipping, I know.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.586
No, it's not the slipping.
It's the rate of the decline.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.796
Only a few weeks,
and he's already deteriorated--

14:39.880 --> 14:41.423
You don't have to tell me. You don't--

14:41.507 --> 14:44.968
I'm the one that's there,
right there with him. The only one.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.555
Hey, but otherwise, physically he's--

14:48.639 --> 14:50.682
He's healthier than either one of us.

14:50.766 --> 14:53.560
I mean… his hand,
his recuperative ability.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.813
And see, that's-- that's why
I suggested this study

14:58.440 --> 15:00.234
and why they're interested in him.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.987
Now, Dr. Rubin wants to sit
with the both of you.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.449
He'll offer some examinations,
maybe ask for some tests.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.326
Like on a guinea pig?

15:09.952 --> 15:14.748
Look, I am told
that Dr. Rubin has had lots of success

15:14.831 --> 15:16.250
with patients just like your uncle.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.253
First off, ain't nobody
just like my uncle.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.088
Yeah.

15:22.381 --> 15:23.715
What you saying, Milton?

15:23.799 --> 15:27.094
You telling I should go along
with these tests? That's the move?

15:27.177 --> 15:31.974
All I'm saying is that
this Dr. Rubin knows more about dementia

15:32.057 --> 15:33.767
than anyone I've ever met.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.519
Yeah.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.355
-That's all you got for me?
-That's all I got.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.899
Other than the alternative.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.079
Look, it's Coy.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.081
Coydog!

15:56.164 --> 15:57.958
-What?
-Hey, Coy! I'm coming--

15:58.041 --> 15:59.543
Papa Grey!

16:03.797 --> 16:05.841
What you doing, Unc?

16:08.302 --> 16:09.761
You've got to pay attention, man.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.054
Hey, motherfucker.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.390
What's up with all the loud talk, partner?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.434
The fuck wrong with this old man? He slow?

16:15.517 --> 16:17.186
Nah, he old. What's wrong with you?

16:17.269 --> 16:19.354
Girl, this nigga be
getting on my damn nerves.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.982
-Get back in this piece of shit.
-I told him to call yesterday.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.066
He didn't do that.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.904
Hello, ladies!
Are y'all going down to Miss Deena's?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.488
Is you a player, Granddad?

16:28.572 --> 16:31.283
I ain't been to Miss Deena's
in about 90 years.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.534
I bet she miss you too, huh?

16:33.368 --> 16:37.039
-I don't even know where it's at no more.
-I bet you could find her if you looked.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.625
I bet you I get older,
I can still cut a rug though.

16:53.680 --> 17:00.562
Sensie.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.066
-Sensie.
-Don't touch me. What's wrong with you?

17:04.147 --> 17:06.358
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.362
He old. He thought you were somebody else.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.569
Don't touch me.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.281
Have a nice day.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.534
Papa Grey, what you doing?

17:13.617 --> 17:16.078
The onliest woman I ever loved,
right there.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.579
God's one true gift to me.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.834
Sensia Howard.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.002
Come on, Unc. Let's go eat.

17:29.758 --> 17:32.010
You know I sent Mr. Johnson packing?

17:32.094 --> 17:33.345
What?

17:33.428 --> 17:36.807
I told the nigga that if he didn't find
some kind of regular job in six weeks,

17:36.890 --> 17:37.975
he had to go.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.227
Can't fault you there.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.106
You look like you losing weight, Mr. Grey.

17:46.650 --> 17:48.694
He mostly only eats when I'm around.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.530
He needs to eat more. Okay?

17:54.449 --> 17:55.868
You want some pie, Uncle?

17:57.744 --> 17:58.745
Uncle?

18:00.455 --> 18:02.624
You know, Reg, it seem like--

18:02.708 --> 18:04.918
seem like I can't remember
nothing no more.

18:06.545 --> 18:08.297
Like, I-- I sit

18:09.715 --> 18:13.635
and I think about
when little Maude Petit come live with us,

18:15.137 --> 18:17.097
then I try to say what day it is.

18:18.432 --> 18:19.683
Ain't got a clue.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.354
So you want me to take you
to that special doctor?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.483
The special doctor
that might help you remember things.

18:36.658 --> 18:38.118
When that chicken gonna come?

18:42.289 --> 18:43.290
Yeah.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.293
-Sonia.
-Yeah, baby?

18:46.376 --> 18:48.212
Can you bring out some more fried thighs?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.380
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, we still hungry.

18:50.464 --> 18:51.673
Okay.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.265
Hello?

19:00.933 --> 19:02.601
Yeah, is this Dr. Rubin's office?

19:03.602 --> 19:06.230
Hi. Yeah. My name's Reginald Lloyd,

19:06.313 --> 19:08.857
and I was told by Dr. Milton Riley
down at the People's Clinic

19:08.941 --> 19:12.653
that I can expect an appointment
for my great-uncle Ptolemy Grey.

19:14.613 --> 19:15.989
You heard of him, huh?

19:17.115 --> 19:19.493
Yo. Hold on.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.371
Next week? Hold on. Okay.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.792
Uh-huh.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.920
As you can see, traffic is backed up
for miles due to a multi-vehicle pileup…

19:30.003 --> 19:31.505
Okay. All right.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.966
Got it. Thank you.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.969
…a semitruck blew a tire, lost control

19:37.052 --> 19:39.388
and slid across multiple lanes
going southbound

19:39.471 --> 19:41.640
where 285 connects to I-85.

19:45.602 --> 19:52.192
Papa Grey.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.987
Yeah, boy?

19:59.366 --> 20:01.869
Unc, you ever worry
about losing your woman?

20:03.829 --> 20:04.830
Your family?

20:06.999 --> 20:09.918
Family--
Family the most important thing you got.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.882
Unc, I got something I need to say,

20:16.383 --> 20:18.385
and I don't know who else to say it to.

20:20.846 --> 20:24.975
It's about Nina and me.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.854
See, Nina…

20:31.481 --> 20:34.735
Nina got this ex-boyfriend
who went to prison for killing somebody.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.866
A dozen were treated for minor injuries
and released on-scene.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.785
At this time,
no casualties have been reported.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.579
Georgia Highway Patrol…

20:48.624 --> 20:49.958
…the devastating scene.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.214
You still with me, Unc?

20:56.006 --> 20:57.883
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.929
So, what do you think I should do?

21:05.557 --> 21:07.768
That-- That woman on the news.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.437
You know, th-- know the pretty, Black one?

21:10.521 --> 21:14.149
She said there's a big wreck
on the freeway,

21:14.233 --> 21:16.568
cars backed up for miles.

21:19.530 --> 21:20.739
Ain't that something?

21:26.078 --> 21:27.079
Yeah.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.836
All right, Unc.

21:37.381 --> 21:40.175
This here, this your next appointment.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.637
It's a big one, all right?

21:43.720 --> 21:48.016
Now, I'll be back by to take you,
but I gotta run.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.395
Already?
Why don't you stay and play some dominoes?

21:51.478 --> 21:54.857
Nah, next time, Unc. Next time.
I gotta go.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.316
It's Latisha's birthday.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.026
Birthday? Y'all having a party?

21:58.110 --> 21:59.111
Nah, nah.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.613
Just-- Just a little cake,
a few presents, you know.

22:02.614 --> 22:03.740
I gotta go.

22:05.284 --> 22:06.535
Well, I'll be here.

22:06.618 --> 22:07.995
Yep.

22:09.079 --> 22:10.956
All right, now, when I leave,
you throw the bolt.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.499
-Throw the bolt.
-What you about to do?

22:12.583 --> 22:14.376
-Throw the bolt.
-That's right.

22:17.963 --> 22:19.423
-Reggie.
-Yeah?

22:31.268 --> 22:33.604
-I'll be back to bring you to the doctor.
-I'll be here.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.897
-Yeah.
-Throw the bolt.

22:34.980 --> 22:35.981
That's it.

22:56.210 --> 22:57.878
There have been several deaths…

23:27.866 --> 23:29.535
…has that lavender…

23:43.507 --> 23:44.508
Coy?

23:47.719 --> 23:49.137
Coydog, you in there?

24:03.735 --> 24:06.530
It's environmentally friendly,
reused soap.

24:06.613 --> 24:09.449
You can feel really good
about using this soap…

24:54.036 --> 24:56.997
And this should come as no surprise
to anybody who has lived in Atlanta

24:57.080 --> 24:58.665
for any length of time that again…

25:01.919 --> 25:02.920
Reggie?

25:26.985 --> 25:28.987
Reg. Reggie, no--

25:30.822 --> 25:33.158
No, no, no bean-- No more bean.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.161
Reggie.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.208
No beans.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.543
Throw the bolt.

26:15.909 --> 26:16.910
What?

26:27.754 --> 26:29.214
Uncle Grey.

26:31.258 --> 26:32.259
Reggie?

26:33.051 --> 26:35.137
Nah, Uncle. It's Hilly.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.221
Who-lly?

26:36.805 --> 26:39.099
Hilly. Niecie's son.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.355
Where Reggie at?

26:46.648 --> 26:49.234
He couldn't-- He couldn't be here.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.904
Mama sent me to come get you.

26:51.987 --> 26:53.488
"Get me"?

26:53.572 --> 26:55.157
What that mean, "Get me"?

26:55.240 --> 26:56.867
Bring you to Niecie's house.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.746
-Niecie.
-Yeah. Niecie.

27:00.829 --> 27:02.998
Hilda Brown, your sister June's daughter.

27:03.081 --> 27:06.043
June-- June dead. June died long time ago.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.128
Look by the wall, Papa Grey.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.964
It's a-- it's the picture
over there on the wall.

27:12.466 --> 27:14.426
How you know what's in my house?

27:14.510 --> 27:16.637
-'Cause I been here before.
-When?

27:16.720 --> 27:19.223
It was a long time ago.
But I-- I've been here.

27:19.306 --> 27:21.892
Look by the wall. There's a picture
with a piece of tape on it.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.602
It say "Hilliard." That's me.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.319
What I'm looking for again?

27:33.111 --> 27:36.615
For "Hilliard." H-I-L-L--

27:36.698 --> 27:39.701
-Okay, all right, all right, all right.
-It's right there by the wall.

27:43.830 --> 27:47.376
June had Niecie.

27:48.794 --> 27:55.634
Niecie had Hilliard, who also named Hilly.

27:57.511 --> 27:59.096
-Yeah.
-Papa Grey, come on, old man.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.265
All right, all right, all right.
Hold your horses.

28:05.769 --> 28:08.730
Damn, Uncle. I ain't think
you was gonna ever open up.

28:08.814 --> 28:10.524
Something wrong with this boy, Pity.

28:11.108 --> 28:13.360
I got eyes, Coy. I can see.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.570
What?

28:16.697 --> 28:18.532
-Come on in.
-All right.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.996
-Well, you gotta move back to let me in.
-What?

28:24.079 --> 28:25.664
You gotta move to let me in, Unc.

28:25.747 --> 28:27.833
Come on, now, move. Goddamn.

28:29.293 --> 28:31.461
What the fuck is that smell?

28:31.545 --> 28:33.630
-I don't smell nothing.
-That's your toilet?

28:34.965 --> 28:36.967
It smell like you boo-booed on yourself.

28:37.968 --> 28:39.970
Uh-uh, no! Now don't be touching things.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.722
-Stop touching things.
-Okay.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.849
Where Reggie at?
He ain't-- He ain't been here.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.767
And today-- Today bank day.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.104
-You need to go to the bank?
-Yeah, with Reggie.

28:50.731 --> 28:52.232
He at Mama's.

28:52.316 --> 28:54.443
I'll take you to the bank.
We go on over there. Come on.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.820
Oh, no! Shit!

28:56.904 --> 28:59.948
Look what you done did! Oh, no!

29:00.032 --> 29:02.743
Don't-- Don't touch 'em.

29:02.826 --> 29:04.536
-Go outside and wait.
-I'ma help you pick up--

29:04.620 --> 29:07.706
-Go wait! I'll come out there.
-Oh, hell, man.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.083
Papa Grey, I need you to come with me
to Mama house.

29:10.167 --> 29:11.919
All right. But go-- go ahead.

29:12.002 --> 29:14.254
-Put on a clean shirt and come home, okay.
-Uh-huh.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.381
-We need to go to the house.
-Okay. All right.

29:16.465 --> 29:18.842

30:05.264 --> 30:07.850
Uh-huh. One, two, three.

Hey, hold it right there, motherfucker!

30:10.394 --> 30:11.520
Hey!

30:12.646 --> 30:15.065

-Fuck you push me for, nigga?

30:15.148 --> 30:17.109

-Your uncle?

30:17.192 --> 30:18.902
That motherfucker there owe me money.

30:18.986 --> 30:21.321
He told me he was gonna give me
money for my rent.

30:21.405 --> 30:23.282
-He promised me, and you know he got it.
-Uh-uh.

30:23.365 --> 30:26.118
Everybody in here know he got a whole bag
full of money in that apartment.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.870
-No.
-Look, he said no.

30:27.953 --> 30:29.496
-I said yeah.
-Look, bitch.

30:29.580 --> 30:32.708
You keep playing with me and I'ma
break your fucking jaw! Get the fuck on.

30:32.791 --> 30:33.876
He owe me.

30:36.962 --> 30:38.630
Somebody owe your ass a bath.

30:41.341 --> 30:43.385
Come on, Papa Grey.
She ain't gonna mess with you.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.721
I'm coming for you, nigga.

30:45.804 --> 30:47.973
She don't mean that shit. Come on.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.058
What bank you been going to?

30:50.142 --> 30:51.185
That way.

30:51.268 --> 30:52.394
I'ma find you.

30:53.145 --> 30:54.354
All right, come on.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.610
What's that about a bag of money?

31:03.071 --> 31:04.448
Do this look like a bank to you?

31:04.531 --> 31:05.741
Slow down, baby.

31:06.575 --> 31:08.410
Ask-- Ask Reggie.

31:09.203 --> 31:11.788
"Ask Reggie." All right, go ahead.
Ask Reggie. Here.

31:11.872 --> 31:14.208
Ask him. You always asking about Reggie.
Ask Reggie.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.084
-I'm tired of hearing that shit.
-What?

31:16.168 --> 31:18.545
You got no bank card on you?
Where your wallet at?

31:18.629 --> 31:19.796
Wallet? Why?

31:19.880 --> 31:23.091
'Cause I'm tryna get us to the bank, Unc.
You don't know where we at.

31:23.884 --> 31:24.968
Goddamn.

31:25.052 --> 31:26.803
Okay, check's right here.

31:27.596 --> 31:28.931
Grollier's Bank.

31:29.014 --> 31:32.184
That shit ain't even on this street.
Shit, man.

31:32.267 --> 31:33.519
Motherfuckers.

31:33.602 --> 31:35.103
What's going on, gentlemen?

31:35.896 --> 31:37.523
Ain't nothing going on, Officer.

31:37.606 --> 31:40.609
My name is Hilliard Brown,
and this is my uncle Ptolemy Grey.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.653
Just chilling.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.071
That the case, sir?

31:46.990 --> 31:48.242
-All right.
-You come with us.

31:48.325 --> 31:50.577
Come on. Ah, man. Hold on, bro. For what?

31:50.661 --> 31:52.996
We're gonna detain you
till we figure out what's--

31:53.080 --> 31:55.457
-I checked him.
-Get your fucking hands off me.

31:55.541 --> 31:58.752
-Hold up. Stop! Stop! Stop, he--
-We're detaining you.

31:58.836 --> 32:00.420
-He who my nephew--
-Sir, you know this man?

32:00.504 --> 32:01.964
Do you know this man?

32:02.047 --> 32:06.677
He who my nephew sent
to bring me where he at. Reggie.

32:06.760 --> 32:11.181
I mean, he ain't Reggie,
but he taking me to where Reggie is.

32:11.265 --> 32:15.519
That's my-- my sister's daughter's boy,
Hilliard.

32:15.602 --> 32:17.396
He taking me to see Reggie.

32:17.479 --> 32:18.689
-Let me see some ID.
-What?

32:18.772 --> 32:20.566
-Show me some ID.
-All right.

32:20.649 --> 32:22.818
Why you always coming through,
messing with folk?

32:23.485 --> 32:26.613
-Just relax, bruh. Chill.
-Do what he say, youngblood.

32:26.697 --> 32:27.948
Damn.

32:28.031 --> 32:29.783
So why are you digging through
his pockets?

32:29.867 --> 32:32.661
I'm just-- I'm just helping him
cash his checks, man.

32:32.744 --> 32:35.539
I'm walking my uncle to the bank.
He don't know where the bank is.

32:35.622 --> 32:38.292
He's senile. He don't know
what the fuck we doing. I'm just--

32:38.375 --> 32:39.668
-Is this true?
-Uh-huh.

32:39.751 --> 32:40.752
You're okay?

32:40.836 --> 32:43.422
-Yes, sir, Mr. Bull. Yes, sir.
-Are you sure you're okay?

32:43.505 --> 32:44.548
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.051
Keep it up, Hilliard.

32:58.395 --> 32:59.396
Here.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.649
Man, you trying to get me killed, bruh?

33:02.733 --> 33:04.443
-What?
-Come on, we need to go to the bus.

33:04.526 --> 33:06.320
You the one fighting with the police.

33:07.529 --> 33:14.369
P-T-O-L-E-M-Y.

33:15.162 --> 33:17.080
Cross the T.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.917
You get three checks every month?

33:20.584 --> 33:22.169
Social security.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.755
This my pension from the post office.

33:24.838 --> 33:28.383
And this is death benefits

33:28.467 --> 33:31.053
from Sensia Howard.

33:32.095 --> 33:34.890
One, two, three.

33:34.973 --> 33:37.100
You a lucky motherfucker, Unc.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.686
If I had that type of money,
my life would be made.

33:40.395 --> 33:41.563
All right.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.234
Excuse me, sir.

33:46.652 --> 33:50.614
Hi. I'm Shirley. Shirley Wring.

33:51.156 --> 33:52.699
Shirley Wring?

33:52.783 --> 33:55.702
W-R-I-N-G.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.873
Hello, W-R-I-N-G.

34:01.291 --> 34:04.628
My name, is-- is Ptolemy.

34:05.337 --> 34:07.297
This is a little embarrassing.

34:07.381 --> 34:10.926
I came here to pay my phone bill,
but I'm short.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.136
I need about $40.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.014
All I have is this.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.404
My father gave it
to my mother 60 years ago.

34:33.949 --> 34:35.242
This a treasure.

34:35.909 --> 34:40.581
And all I ask is that you let me buy it
back when I get my social security--

34:40.664 --> 34:46.043
This what Coydog was trying to tell me.

34:46.962 --> 34:51.049
A treasure to save all the Black peoples.

34:51.550 --> 34:53.177
Hello, Mr. Grey.

34:55.262 --> 34:57.181
Do you remember me? Kora Brooks?

34:58.390 --> 34:59.641
Uh-huh.

35:00.309 --> 35:03.854
Mr. Brown here says that you want him
to cash your checks.

35:05.856 --> 35:08.317
Reggie is over his house,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.903
and Hilliard is taking me there.

35:11.528 --> 35:13.447
So, you know Mr. Brown?

35:13.530 --> 35:16.283
-He just told you that.
-Yeah.

35:16.366 --> 35:20.829
He-- He's my sister's daughter's child.

35:21.455 --> 35:24.082
-Niecie's boy.
-Niecie's boy. I told you that, lady.

35:24.166 --> 35:26.543
I got her on the phone,
I can call her now and ask her.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.086
That's not necessary.

35:29.505 --> 35:31.423
-Come with me, Mr. Brown.
-Thank you.

35:32.382 --> 35:34.468
Man. You know, we got shit to do. Come on.

35:35.719 --> 35:39.681
So, can you lend me the money, Ptolemy?

35:40.390 --> 35:44.102
Okay, that's three checks. That's $300.

35:53.946 --> 35:55.781
Come on, Unc. Let's go, we already late.

35:55.864 --> 36:00.035
Hey, this here Miss, W-R-I-N-G.

36:00.118 --> 36:02.079
Hey. Come on, let's go.

36:02.162 --> 36:03.455
I need my money.

36:03.539 --> 36:06.625
-I'ma hold on to it for you.
-I need it now.

36:07.209 --> 36:09.461
All right. Damn.

36:12.089 --> 36:14.258
Where are the other two envelopes?

36:14.341 --> 36:16.385
They only put the money in one envelope.

36:21.682 --> 36:23.767
Count out what you need.

36:29.690 --> 36:32.067
I took an even 50.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.820
Thank you so much, Ptolemy.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.406
And this…

36:40.033 --> 36:41.827
is my gift to you.

36:43.495 --> 36:45.414
Come on, Unc. Let's go.

36:47.708 --> 36:51.420
Hell yeah, man. Police tried to tase me
in my neck and everything, bruh.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.172
It is what it is though.

36:53.964 --> 36:55.382
All right, my bruh. All right.

36:59.428 --> 37:01.388
Unc, put your money away, man.

37:01.471 --> 37:06.351
Whenever I go to the bank with Reggie,
I always end up with near about $300.

37:06.435 --> 37:08.228
One, two, three.

37:08.312 --> 37:11.064
This here ain't but one. One hundred.

37:11.148 --> 37:13.609
You don't remember you gave
your money to the old lady?

37:14.484 --> 37:17.029
An even 50. That's what she took. Even 50.

37:17.112 --> 37:18.572
Nah, she took almost two.

37:18.655 --> 37:21.200
I'm telling you. I saw her.
She took almost two.

37:22.659 --> 37:25.204
-Let me count it again.
-Hands off my money.

37:25.287 --> 37:28.582
You stole enough of my money already.
Thief.

37:41.345 --> 37:42.804
Here we are.

37:50.938 --> 37:52.564
This Reggie birthday party?

37:53.857 --> 37:54.858
Kinda.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.876
Pitypapa.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.797
Hey, baby. It's been too long.

38:19.299 --> 38:21.426
It's me, Pitypapa.

38:21.510 --> 38:23.720
Your favorite niece. Niecie.

38:23.804 --> 38:25.973
-June-- June's girl.
-That's right.

38:26.056 --> 38:28.016
You remember. That's right.

38:28.100 --> 38:29.518
Ain't nothing wrong with you.

38:29.601 --> 38:31.228
And here you are in my house.

38:31.311 --> 38:34.940
Where Reggie? He ain't-- He ain't
been to my house eight, nine bean cans.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.401
Robyn.

38:38.110 --> 38:39.611
Robyn! Where--

38:40.529 --> 38:43.282
We ran out of the ribs,
but we got enough fried chicken.

38:43.365 --> 38:46.410
Ms. Hannah brought the coleslaw,
but I can still go get Hawaiian Punch mix.

38:46.493 --> 38:49.079
Don't worry about that now.
There's somebody I want you to meet.

38:49.162 --> 38:52.541
Pitypapa, this here is
my best friend Frida's little girl, Robyn.

38:52.624 --> 38:55.669
Frida died,
so now Robyn live here with me and Hilly.

38:56.503 --> 38:58.922
Robyn, this is my mother's brother,
Mr. Ptolemy Grey.

39:00.799 --> 39:01.800
Hey.

39:02.384 --> 39:05.304
Robyn. First bird of spring.

39:07.347 --> 39:10.058
She might be coming by
to help you out sometime.

39:10.976 --> 39:11.977
Ain't that right?

39:12.853 --> 39:13.979
I guess.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.025
You hungry?

39:18.734 --> 39:22.279
Well, I wanna see Hilly-- I-I mean Reggie.
I-I wanna see Reggie.

39:23.739 --> 39:26.408
Get something in your stomach first, yeah?

39:26.491 --> 39:27.576
Then Reggie.

39:29.077 --> 39:32.164
Robyn, can you please put the phone down?

39:32.247 --> 39:34.917
Take your uncle
and go fix him a plate, please.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.543
That is not my uncle.

39:40.088 --> 39:41.089
Well, come on.

39:50.307 --> 39:52.893
Where Reggie? The--
The thief said he was gonna be here.

39:52.976 --> 39:54.978
-The what?
-Where Reggie at?

39:55.062 --> 39:57.773
He got in trouble 'cause he stayed
in town so long taking care of you.

39:57.856 --> 40:00.943
Reggie in trouble? Where at?
We got to go help him.

40:01.026 --> 40:02.444
He ain't in trouble no more.

40:03.612 --> 40:04.655
He's fine.

40:07.407 --> 40:08.408
Greens?

40:09.660 --> 40:10.661
Yes, ma'am.

40:14.122 --> 40:15.165
Yams?

40:15.249 --> 40:16.250
Yeah.

40:18.335 --> 40:19.461
Coleslaw?

40:19.545 --> 40:21.171
I already got greens on my plate.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.422
And what about fried chicken?

40:22.506 --> 40:24.341
Yeah. Thigh, please.

40:30.889 --> 40:33.684
Sorry, I dropped it. It's-- It's my fault.

40:34.268 --> 40:37.062
-I'm sorry. I dropped it.
-Here. Wipe yourself off, little sister.

40:37.563 --> 40:38.564
I got you.

40:40.816 --> 40:44.278
It's-- It's all good, Mr. Grey.

40:44.361 --> 40:46.572
-It's all right.
-I know you?

40:47.781 --> 40:48.824
Yeah.

40:48.907 --> 40:50.117
Billy Freres, sir.

40:51.410 --> 40:54.663
Me and Reggie been best friends
since we were little boys.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.290
Don't you remember?

40:56.373 --> 40:58.000
We used to come to your house
all the time.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.793
You let us look through
your old magazines.

40:59.877 --> 41:01.795
National Geographic. Jet.

41:01.879 --> 41:02.963
Y'all was looking for naked girls.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.049
Yeah, you remember that.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.303
Hey, want some fried chicken, Mr. Grey?

41:10.304 --> 41:11.597
Thighs.

41:12.306 --> 41:13.348
I got you.

41:26.278 --> 41:27.446
Look at him.

41:27.529 --> 41:30.365
Just eating like a pig, don't know shit.

41:32.492 --> 41:37.289
Well… he was there for Reggie
when he needed a gentle hand.

41:38.707 --> 41:41.502
When we were kids,
he used to let us play for hours,

41:41.585 --> 41:44.463
and never, not once,
did he say a bad word.

42:32.636 --> 42:33.929
You want anything else?

42:39.017 --> 42:40.477
I wanna see Reggie.

42:41.728 --> 42:42.729
Come on.

42:53.532 --> 42:55.033
Say excuse me, man.

42:55.117 --> 42:57.786
Sorry, sir-- Nice-- Nice gators.

43:00.497 --> 43:01.498
Who he?

43:01.582 --> 43:03.625
Alfred somebody.
Think he a friend of Reggie's.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.544
-He shouldn't be doing that.
-I was trying--

43:05.627 --> 43:06.670
Nina.

43:07.880 --> 43:08.964
Look who it is.

43:09.965 --> 43:12.092
-What's up, Robyn?
-Hey.

43:12.176 --> 43:13.886
This is Reggie's great-uncle.

43:13.969 --> 43:15.762
Yeah, Papa Grey.

43:17.723 --> 43:20.893
I'm glad you're here.
Reggie talked a lot about you.

43:20.976 --> 43:22.186
Well, where Reggie at?

43:25.355 --> 43:26.356
This way.

43:31.570 --> 43:33.822
His little children
like me and Maude Petit was

43:33.906 --> 43:35.115

43:54.551 --> 43:55.552
How come--

43:56.637 --> 43:58.347
How come y'all got him in here like this?

43:59.139 --> 44:00.390
Somebody shot him.

44:01.808 --> 44:04.645
Ain't nobody tell me. Didn't n--
Didn't nobody say.

44:04.728 --> 44:06.563
-Nobody ain't call you?
-Nobody said.

44:06.647 --> 44:08.815
No, don't think so.
No. I-- I don't remember.

44:08.899 --> 44:11.235
I-I don't remember. I don't think so.

44:11.860 --> 44:14.279
Oh, Reggie. Oh, God.

44:14.363 --> 44:15.614
Oh, God.

44:25.082 --> 44:27.209
Oh, God, Reggie!

44:27.835 --> 44:29.920
Please, God, no.

44:33.006 --> 44:34.508
Please.

44:34.591 --> 44:38.220
Please, Reggie. Please, get up.
Don't be dead.

44:38.846 --> 44:40.389
Please, don't be dead.

44:53.861 --> 44:55.112
There he is.

44:56.071 --> 44:58.490
-Yeah, I'ma take him home.
-I'm supposed to take him.

44:58.574 --> 45:02.202
Yeah, well, he don't like you.
Says you messed up his stuff.

45:02.286 --> 45:04.162
His stuff was already messed up
when I got there.

45:04.246 --> 45:05.330
Yeah, you made it worse.

45:05.414 --> 45:09.585
Yeah. And he-- he-- stole my one, two
and just give me three.

45:10.711 --> 45:13.881
-What's he talking about?
-I don't know. You know he crazy.

45:15.716 --> 45:17.009
Let Robyn take him.

45:18.051 --> 45:19.720
You'll be home soon, Pitypapa.

45:20.679 --> 45:24.892
Aight, come on. I'll take you to the bus
and get you to your house.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.813
Reggie gonna come later?

45:30.856 --> 45:32.149
Yeah, he gonna be there.

46:12.648 --> 46:13.649
You all right?

46:15.150 --> 46:16.485
Reggie really dead?

46:19.196 --> 46:20.197
Yeah.

46:20.989 --> 46:22.324
Well, who killed him?

46:23.784 --> 46:24.785
Nobody know.

46:33.544 --> 46:35.212
I'ma find who did it.

46:37.339 --> 46:42.928
I swear.
