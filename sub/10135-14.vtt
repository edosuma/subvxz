07:36.539 --> 07:39.251
be watching the movie.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.627
Why not?

07:42.296 --> 07:44.923
Okay, no more questions.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.923
Everybody in the car.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.091
I got the front seat!

07:47.134 --> 07:49.594
Wanna hear something amazing?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.804
Sure, kid.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.854

08:09.906 --> 08:13.327

08:09.906 --> 08:13.327
and of course bonbons.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.162
You forgot the nachos.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.372
Michelle, let's not be pigs.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.126
Ah, Steph, where's my change?

08:21.168 --> 08:23.920
Change? If there was any money

08:21.168 --> 08:23.920
left I would have bought nachos.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.965
Oh, Steph.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.801
Excuse me, could you

08:27.007 --> 08:29.801
save our place? Thanks.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.053
Steve, this is really

08:29.843 --> 08:32.053
embarrassing

08:32.095 --> 08:35.349
but I don't have enough money

08:32.095 --> 08:35.349
to pay for my sisters.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.766
I only have enough for us.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.726
Hey, maybe we should forget

08:36.808 --> 08:38.726
the whole thing.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.229
No, no, wait, um..

08:41.271 --> 08:43.398
...why don't you

08:41.271 --> 08:43.398
just buy our tickets?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.026
Kimmy just started working here.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.026
Maybe she'll have an idea.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.277
That'll be a first.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.865
- Thank you.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.865
- Enjoy the show.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.534
Don't spill anything.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
I'm the one that

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
has to clean up!

08:57.871 --> 08:59.414
Hey, Kimmy, we need to talk.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.500
I know.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.500
You're with Steve Peters.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.377
So why'd you bring

09:01.541 --> 09:03.377
those rug rats?

09:03.418 --> 09:06.046
I had no choice.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.046
Hey, can I borrow ten bucks?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.839
Yeah, sure, but I can't

09:06.087 --> 09:07.839
get it right now.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.965
I'm on duty.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.676
If I leave,

09:09.007 --> 09:11.676
kids will sneak in.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.053
Kimmy, that's the answer.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.971
You have to sneak

09:13.094 --> 09:14.971
my sisters in.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.682
What? You're asking me

09:15.013 --> 09:17.682
to commit a crime?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.184
My first day on the job?

09:20.477 --> 09:22.062
I'm shocked!

09:22.103 --> 09:24.814
- You're not gonna do it?

09:22.103 --> 09:24.814
- Well, of course I'll do it.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.691
But I'm still shocked!

09:28.318 --> 09:29.736
Thanks. You're my hero.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.073
Thank you.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.616
- Come on, Michelle.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.616

09:35.658 --> 09:36.993
Great!

Uh! You don't need any.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.045
Tell them, Kimmy.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.297
Yeah, that's right,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.297

- Perfect.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.790
This is cozy.

It'll be even cozier

15:35.643 --> 15:37.729
we stick to our story.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.814

15:44.151 --> 15:47.781
with you and got in trouble.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.949
We're doomed.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.787
Michelle, you played

15:51.158 --> 15:53.787
Candyland with me

15:53.828 --> 15:55.580
and won a ding dong, remember?

15:55.622 --> 15:59.459
Oh, yeah.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.459
Can I take back my<i> duh?</i>

16:03.546 --> 16:06.591
Now get off my case. So I wasn't

16:03.546 --> 16:06.591
the best skater out there.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.967
You call that skating?

16:08.008 --> 16:10.511
Your butt never left the ice.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.306
Even flat on my back,

16:10.553 --> 16:13.306
I got some good shots off.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.682
Yeah, you got the winning goal.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.893
For the other team!

16:16.935 --> 16:18.645
But the goalie

16:16.935 --> 16:18.645
should've blocked that shot.

16:18.686 --> 16:19.813
Or any shot.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.315
Danny, what the heck

16:20.939 --> 16:22.315
were you doing

16:22.356 --> 16:24.275
on your hands and knees, anyway?

16:24.317 --> 16:27.946
I was just cleaning

16:24.317 --> 16:27.946
the slush around my area.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.073
It's not an area,

16:27.987 --> 16:31.073
it happens to be a goal crease

16:31.115 --> 16:34.702
and you're supposed to be

16:31.115 --> 16:34.702
defending it, not cleaning it!

16:34.744 --> 16:36.496
I was defending it.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.665
Until it got all icky.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.249
Danny, you've got

16:38.706 --> 16:40.249
a real problem--

16:40.291 --> 16:41.751
Let me tell you something,

16:40.291 --> 16:41.751
you've got a real problem.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.711
You take this hockey stuff

16:41.793 --> 16:43.711
way too seriously.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.297
Hey, listen, Dippity-do Head.

16:47.632 --> 16:49.717
What, Elmer Fudd Face?

16:50.969 --> 16:52.762
Take that back, Do Head.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.974
Make me, Fudd Face.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.309
Hey, hey, hey, Do Head,

16:56.015 --> 16:58.309
Fudd Face, come on.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.395
Whatever happened

16:59.519 --> 17:01.395
to the Three Musketeers?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.564
Musketeer this, Mop and Glo.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.486
It's Mr. Mop and Glo

17:06.275 --> 17:08.486
to you, buddy.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.822
Oh, c'mon, it's ridiculous

17:08.528 --> 17:10.822
you out there cleanin' the ice.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.365
Hey, I've seen players

17:10.864 --> 17:12.365
cleaning the ice--

17:12.406 --> 17:14.367
- I've seen--

17:12.406 --> 17:14.367
- Not with pledge!

17:14.408 --> 17:18.454
Okay, boys, you made it through

17:14.408 --> 17:18.454
your first visit to Aunt Ida's.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.373
And I promise, we'll get

17:18.496 --> 17:20.373
all that lipstick off.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.461
[indistinct chatter]

17:25.503 --> 17:26.546
Here we go.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.797
- I got that.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.797
- Ow!

17:29.215 --> 17:30.299
Stop it!

17:32.051 --> 17:34.136
Hello, boys.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.680
(in unison)

17:34.178 --> 17:35.680
Hello.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.685
We were just, uh,

17:38.391 --> 17:40.685
horsing around a little.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.854
That's right,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.854
just three guys horsing around.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.399
- Yep. It's a guy thing.

17:42.896 --> 17:46.399
- Oh, isn't that cute?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.819
Your daddy and his buddies

17:46.440 --> 17:49.819
roughhousing like little boys.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.111
Well, I guess

17:49.861 --> 17:51.111
that's how you strengthen

17:51.153 --> 17:52.906
those bonds of male friendship.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.533
Just like those chimps

17:52.947 --> 17:55.533
we saw last week at the zoo.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.707
Becky's right.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.626
- We're no better than chimps.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.626
- Yeah.

18:05.668 --> 18:09.714
What's wrestling around on the

18:05.668 --> 18:09.714
carpeting going to prove anyhow?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.716
Want to see who can

18:09.756 --> 18:11.716
do the most pushups?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.259
Yeah.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.803
(in unison)

18:13.300 --> 18:15.803
One, two, three, four.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.265
[sniffling]

18:20.349 --> 18:22.226
Get used to it.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.064
Here comes dad.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.565
Now, everybody

18:26.105 --> 18:27.565
remember their stories.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.275
Baloney sandwich,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.275
book report.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.777
Candyland, ding dong.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.987
Hey, girls.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.196
- Hello.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.282
Deej, thanks again

18:34.238 --> 18:36.282
for babysitting.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.951
It's really great to know

18:36.323 --> 18:37.951
that I have a mature

18:37.992 --> 18:39.994
responsible daughter

18:37.992 --> 18:39.994
that I can count on.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.370
Thanks, dad.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.208
<i>(DJ)</i>

18:42.538 --> 18:46.208
<i>I am scum. I'm lower than scum.</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:48.294
<i>I'm the scum</i>

18:46.250 --> 18:48.294
<i>they scrape off scum.</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.714
So, Steph, did you finish

18:49.796 --> 18:51.714
your book report?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.800
Sure did, and then I had

18:51.756 --> 18:53.800
a baloney sandwich

18:53.841 --> 18:56.552
diagonally sliced a refreshing

18:53.841 --> 18:56.552
glass of chocolate milk

18:56.594 --> 18:58.178
and a ding dong.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.807
<i>That sounds so fake.</i>

19:00.848 --> 19:03.183
Sounds like you had

19:00.848 --> 19:03.183
a really productive day.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.727
<i>He bought it!</i>

19:06.062 --> 19:07.647
And how was your day, Michelle?

19:07.688 --> 19:09.107
Let's see..

19:09.774 --> 19:11.818
<i>We're busted.</i>

19:11.859 --> 19:15.696
I played Candyland with D.J.,

19:11.859 --> 19:15.696
and I won a ding dong.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.782
<i>Yes!</i>

19:17.824 --> 19:19.283
That's great.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.283
You know what, honey?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.911
Let me just get a tissue

19:19.325 --> 19:21.911
and wipe your nose for you.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.204
<i>I've turned my sisters</i>

19:21.953 --> 19:24.204
<i>into liars..</i>

19:24.956 --> 19:26.916
<i>...but good liars.</i>

19:26.958 --> 19:28.501
I've got an idea.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.837
Since you girls were cooped up

19:28.542 --> 19:30.837
in the house all day.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.088
Why don't we go

19:30.878 --> 19:32.088
to a movie, tonight?

19:32.130 --> 19:33.506
- Alright.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.506
- Yeah.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.675
<i>Uh-oh. He knows something.</i>

19:35.716 --> 19:37.468
How about

19:35.716 --> 19:37.468
"The Littlest Sea Lion?"

19:37.510 --> 19:38.886
Have you girls seen it?

19:38.928 --> 19:41.514
No, dad, I can honestly

19:38.928 --> 19:41.514
say we haven't.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.686
Great. You know, Deej?

19:46.727 --> 19:49.063
Since you're becoming

19:46.727 --> 19:49.063
so responsible

19:49.105 --> 19:50.815
maybe it's time I raised

19:49.105 --> 19:50.815
your allowance, huh?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.984
<i>I don't deserve a raise.</i>

19:53.026 --> 19:55.736
How does two-fifty more

19:53.026 --> 19:55.736
a week sound?

19:55.778 --> 19:57.279
Sounds great.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.281
<i>Why is he torturing me?</i>

19:59.323 --> 20:00.950
I love you, sweetheart.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.077
<i>I can't take it anymore!</i>

20:03.119 --> 20:04.912
I can't take it anymore!

20:04.954 --> 20:06.497
Dad, Steve came over

20:06.539 --> 20:09.750
and we took Stephanie

20:06.539 --> 20:09.750
and Michelle to the movies.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.836
We didn't have enough money

20:09.792 --> 20:11.836
to pay for them.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.213
So I made Kimmy sneak 'em in,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.213
and then we all got caught.

20:14.254 --> 20:17.675
And then I forced them to lie

20:14.254 --> 20:17.675
to you about the whole thing.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.553
And that's what really happened.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.429
<i>I feel so much better.</i>

20:25.892 --> 20:28.061
<i>Ooh. That's a bad face.</i>

20:30.270 --> 20:32.023
I'm really sorry, dad.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.983
So am I.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.609
I can't believe this.

20:35.651 --> 20:39.072
It's true. The whole thing

20:35.651 --> 20:39.072
about the baloney sandwich?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.489
Never happened.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.994
Go ahead, dad. Ground me.

20:45.036 --> 20:48.539
Alright, you're grounded.

20:45.036 --> 20:48.539
All three of you.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.124
We're all grounded?

20:50.166 --> 20:53.460
Even me, your little princess?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.628
Dad, they don't deserve it.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.172
I told them they weren't lying

20:56.214 --> 20:57.339
just telling a fiblet.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.175
They still went along with it.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.885
Ultimately,

20:59.217 --> 21:00.885
you're each responsible

21:00.927 --> 21:02.344
for that choices

21:00.927 --> 21:02.344
that you made.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.222
And you gonna have

21:02.386 --> 21:04.222
to accept the consequences.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.306
Huh?

21:06.348 --> 21:10.103
That means you do the crime,

21:06.348 --> 21:10.103
you do the time.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.815
Does this mean no

21:11.687 --> 21:14.815
Little Sea Lion?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.234
No Little Sea Lion.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.737
That's the second time

21:16.275 --> 21:19.737
I missed him<i> today!</i>

21:21.655 --> 21:23.365
Deej, what happened?

21:23.407 --> 21:26.119
We got away with the whole

21:23.407 --> 21:26.119
thing and then you blew it.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.579
I couldn't go through with it.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.791
Ever hear that little voice in

21:28.621 --> 21:31.791
your head saying this is wrong?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.668
Sure, but I told it to shut up

21:31.832 --> 21:34.668
and I listened to you.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.925
Do I have a little

21:37.880 --> 21:40.925
voice in my head?

21:40.967 --> 21:43.886
Yeah, everybody does.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.886
It's called your conscience.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.930
And when you do something

21:43.928 --> 21:45.930
you know is wrong

21:45.972 --> 21:49.683
your conscience reminds you

21:45.972 --> 21:49.683
over and over and over..

21:49.725 --> 21:51.560
...until you

21:49.725 --> 21:51.560
do something about it.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.646
It sounds like a pain

21:51.602 --> 21:53.646
in the neck.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.317
Look, I'm really sorry

21:55.481 --> 21:58.317
I got you guys grounded.

21:58.358 --> 22:00.236
Thanks for backing me up.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.281
Tell you what, Steph.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.117
I'm going to help you

22:03.322 --> 22:06.117
with this book report.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.367
And after that, Michelle

22:07.409 --> 22:09.912
you and I are going

22:07.409 --> 22:09.912
to play Candyland.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.581
And I promise to spend

22:09.954 --> 22:12.581
more time with both you guys.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.668
Give me a hug.

22:15.709 --> 22:19.588
Hey, you guys can hang out

22:15.709 --> 22:19.588
in my room any time you want.

22:19.630 --> 22:22.508
<i>Whoa, DJ,</i>

22:19.630 --> 22:22.508
<i>don't get carried away.</i>
