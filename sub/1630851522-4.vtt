McGrath has called me
three times,

10:48.430 --> 10:50.127
so please tell me
that we have something.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.868
- We fine-toothed
the apartment.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.261
We're waiting to hear
from the lab.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.305
- The vic couldn't give much
of an ID aside from

10:54.349 --> 10:55.785
the perp knowing her name.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.221
- And she said
that she let the guy in?

10:57.265 --> 10:59.267
I mean, I know that it was
a Con Ed ruse,

10:59.310 --> 11:01.791
so you obviously followed up
on that.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.185
- They didn't send anybody
to the building that night.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.056
And there was no reports
of a gas leak.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.928
- Similar M.O.'s
in the neighborhood,

11:07.971 --> 11:09.407
recently released
sex offenders?

11:09.451 --> 11:10.844
- No and no,

11:10.887 --> 11:12.715
and no security cams
in the building.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.326
For what it's worth, she's in
a custody battle with her ex,

11:15.370 --> 11:16.676
Eduardo Sosa.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.112
In 2019, they were
both arrested

11:18.155 --> 11:20.288
for a public argument.
Neither pressed charges.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.724
- Does the ex have an alibi?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.726
- Yeah, he was home that night
with his girlfriend.

11:23.770 --> 11:24.945
He picked up the kid.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.294
- Then I'm not interested
in the backstory.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.775
- Here's something.
Lab got a hit off a print.

11:28.818 --> 11:29.950
- From the doorjamb?

11:29.993 --> 11:31.560
- CSU found multiples
at the scene,

11:31.603 --> 11:33.388
but none were in the system
except for a Travis Hillsdale.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.346
- Who is?
- Hold on.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.740
- Travis Hillsdale, busted
last year for dealing marijuana

11:37.784 --> 11:41.048
out of his Swirly City
ice cream truck.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.746
- Crystal said she was bothered
by some guys in the park

11:43.790 --> 11:44.965
when she was buying Manny
ice cream.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.401
- Okay, but it doesn't explain

11:46.444 --> 11:48.229
why the ice cream guy's
in her apartment.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.753
- So an ice cream truck
shouldn't be that hard to find.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.888
- Enjoy.
Have a good day.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.152
- Travis Hillsdale?

11:58.195 --> 12:00.415
- Yeah, afternoon, officers.
How can I help?

12:00.458 --> 12:02.504
- Uh, we're investigating
an attack.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.288
The vic said she may have been
harassed at the park

12:04.332 --> 12:06.290
at Pitt Street the other day,

12:06.334 --> 12:07.335
buying ice cream.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.945
- We're hoping you saw
something.

12:08.989 --> 12:12.775
- I'll be right out.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.821
Hey, uh, how can I help?

12:14.864 --> 12:16.257
- You recognize her?

12:16.300 --> 12:17.780
- Uh, actually, yeah,
that's Crystal.

12:17.824 --> 12:18.825
She's a regular.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.000
Her kid likes
rainbow sprinkles.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.915
- Did she get her kid
a cone on Friday?

12:21.958 --> 12:23.394
- You know what, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.309
- You notice any guys
bothering her?

12:25.353 --> 12:28.008
- Was it those idiots?
What'd they do?

12:28.051 --> 12:29.096
- You know them?

12:29.139 --> 12:30.314
- Okay, they hang out,

12:30.358 --> 12:33.013
harass these moms
in front of their kids.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.145
Every day, I have to tell them
to leave my customers alone.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.190
- I got one more question.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.366
You ever been over
to her apartment?

12:38.409 --> 12:40.237
- Oh, she say that?
I mean, 'cause,

12:40.281 --> 12:42.762
actually, yeah, I was there,
but I didn't see her.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.241
Just, you know,
Manny dropped his sippy cup.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.416
And I returned it.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.853
- How'd you know
where she lived?

12:46.896 --> 12:48.245
- Yeah, one of the other moms.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.204
Brought the cup back,
gave it to Manny's sitter.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.771
- Travis,
you seem like a nice guy.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.469
And we're trying to get whoever
did this off the street.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.253
We have a suspect down
at that station.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.908
Would you mind coming down,
helping us with an ID?

13:02.390 --> 13:04.871
- Take your time, Crystal.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.090
- I kind of recognize number 2.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.051
- As the man who raped you?

13:11.094 --> 13:12.530
- From somewhere else,
I'm sorry.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.228
I don't think it's him.
I don't think it's any of--

13:14.271 --> 13:15.838
I-- it was dark--

13:15.882 --> 13:17.971
- It's okay, it's okay,
Crystal.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.322
- Let's find a seat.
- Thank you.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.368
- No luck?

13:24.412 --> 13:26.196
- Well,
she did recognize Travis.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.198
- But maybe because she's a
regular at his ice cream truck.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.852
- Then why didn't she say that?
- Who knows?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.158
He keeps his mask on at work.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.986
He did volunteer to help us
with the lineup.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.074
- What about prints?

13:34.117 --> 13:35.249
- We confirmed with the sitter.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.077
He returned the sippy cup
last week.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.818
- All right, so he's either
a good Samaritan,

13:38.861 --> 13:41.081
or he's casing her apartment.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.909
- Either way,
Crystal did not ID him,

13:42.952 --> 13:44.301
and the fingerprint isn't
probative.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.869
Now if we find any unknown DNA
on that bed,

13:46.913 --> 13:47.957
maybe we can test him?

13:48.001 --> 13:50.481
- Velasco,
before Travis leaves,

13:50.525 --> 13:52.266
ask him if he would like
a soda.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.834
- Get his DNA.
On it, Captain.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.535
- Uh, Crystal's lab results
came back.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.190
- Please tell me
it's good news.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.452
- Just the opposite.

14:04.495 --> 14:08.064
- Uh, between the rape kit
and her bedding,

14:08.108 --> 14:10.545
three different semen samples.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.896
- Anybody in the system?
- None.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.159
- When you asked her,
she didn't mention

14:16.203 --> 14:18.161
having anyone special
in her life right now?

14:19.380 --> 14:23.123
- Just her son.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.392
.

14:31.435 --> 14:35.178
- How long does semen last?
- Long enough.

14:35.222 --> 14:36.658
- There were three samples.

14:36.701 --> 14:40.967
Hopefully, one of those samples
will be...

14:41.010 --> 14:43.491
your rapist.

14:43.534 --> 14:46.842
But we do need you
to walk us through

14:46.886 --> 14:50.715
who the other two can be so we
can eliminate them as suspects.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.892
- Oh, my God.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.461
This is why
I didn't tell you.

14:57.505 --> 15:02.771
My ex is trying to get custody
of Manny, and if he finds out--

15:02.814 --> 15:04.642
- You're a single woman.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.951
- He kind of thinks
we're still together.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.736
- So your ex is
one of the samples.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.477
- Probably.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.570
He--he came by two days ago.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.573
It--it always puts him
in a better mood.

15:22.617 --> 15:26.360
- Okay,
who else can you tell us about?

15:27.796 --> 15:30.755
- Up the mountain in five,
four, three--

15:30.799 --> 15:32.975
[workout music]

15:33.019 --> 15:36.326
- Raif Tawari?

15:36.370 --> 15:40.940
- There you go, keep breathing.
Three minutes, everybody.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.812
Okay, push, don't stop.
Don't stop.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.555
Yeah?
What is this about?

15:47.598 --> 15:48.991
- You were at a party
on a rooftop,

15:49.035 --> 15:51.951
Loisaida, Friday night?

15:51.994 --> 15:54.301
- Yeah.
Again, what is this about?

15:54.344 --> 15:55.998
- You hook up with anyone?

15:56.042 --> 15:58.522
- That was totally consensual.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.960
- Is that her?

16:01.003 --> 16:03.745
- Crystal, right?
What's she saying?

16:03.788 --> 16:05.399
- How about we ask
the questions?

16:05.442 --> 16:09.620
- Okay, look, we were dancing.

16:09.664 --> 16:12.406
Hot.
She was, like, into it.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.798
In control.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.409
We took the party
to another location.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.758
- Her apartment?

16:16.801 --> 16:18.934
- No, a corner of the roof.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.675
After, I walked her home.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.460
She said I couldn't come up.
She had to let the sitter go.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.592
I didn't even know
she had a kid.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.594
- Life's full of surprises,
huh?

16:26.637 --> 16:28.030
- Any chance you went
back anyway?

16:28.074 --> 16:30.641
Doubled back for round two?

16:30.685 --> 16:32.774
No big deal.
- No.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.951
Man, no.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.955
Look, I went home to my wife.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.739
We were in bed by midnight.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.046
You're not gonna tell either
one of them, are you?

16:48.572 --> 16:49.704
- Am I in trouble?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.926
- You tell me, Arlo.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.363
How about we start
with your relationship

16:56.406 --> 16:57.668
to Crystal Nuñez.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.061
- Well,
she's my upstairs neighbor.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.759
- We know that.
And?

17:01.803 --> 17:04.545
- She sometimes calls me
her--her "minute man."

17:04.588 --> 17:05.850
- Minute man.
- Yeah.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.461
- Uh-huh.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.506
- Not like that.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.639
We started hooking up
during Covid.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.989
We'd get together whenever she
had a little bit of downtime

17:14.033 --> 17:16.557
and her kid was napping.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.907
She texted, I'd come up.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.084
It was a lonely time,
and we needed each other.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.564
It was sweet.
- I'm sure it was.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.522
And when was the last time
you were in her apartment?

17:25.566 --> 17:28.090
- A few nights ago.
Manny was asleep.

17:28.134 --> 17:31.485
And she was, well, you know.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.704
- "Few nights ago"?
Like, two nights? Friday?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.752
- No, no way.
I--I swear.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.145
- Why not?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.537
- Because every Friday,
I go home and have dinner

17:40.581 --> 17:41.843
with my mother.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.454
Spend the night
at my old house in Babylon.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.500
And she does my laundry.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.111
- Yeah.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.157
- How's Crystal doing?
I'm worried about her.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.680
She makes
a lot of bad decisions.

17:52.723 --> 17:53.855
- When's the last time
you saw her?

17:53.898 --> 17:55.117
- This afternoon.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.032
She wanted Manny back.
I brought him back.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.818
Her apartment was a crap show,
I gotta tell you.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.604
- What about two nights ago,
Friday?

18:03.647 --> 18:05.519
- You mean the night
she was attacked?

18:05.562 --> 18:07.956
Find that guy yet?
- We're still investigating.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.741
- I'd kill him myself,
I had any idea.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.006
- Mr. Sosa,
you told us earlier

18:15.050 --> 18:16.878
you were home with
your girlfriend that night?

18:16.921 --> 18:18.706
- Yeah.
What's it to you?

18:18.749 --> 18:21.056
- Well, we since found out
you and Crystal have been

18:21.100 --> 18:23.580
hooking up.
Maybe you came over earlier.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.452
She got angry for some reason,
called the cops.

18:25.495 --> 18:26.801
- Are you kidding me with this?

18:26.844 --> 18:28.585
- Look, man, you have a DV
complaint against you.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.892
We gotta ask these questions.
- That was more her than me.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.547
Okay? We were drunk, loud.
Crystal pushed me.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.026
Couple Karens called the cops.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.552
We scream, but I ain't never
lay a hand on Crystal.

18:38.595 --> 18:39.988
You accusing me of something,
say it.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.642
- We confirm
with your girlfriend

18:41.685 --> 18:43.600
you were home,
and we take you off the list.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.559
- I don't want her
involved in this.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.038
What's really going on?
Hmm?

18:47.082 --> 18:49.693
Crystal said that she was raped
in front of my kid.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.608
If she's lying--
- Mr. Sosa, calm down.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.872
- No, no, no, we're talking
about my son.

18:54.916 --> 18:57.701
Don't you tell me to calm down.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.229
- Crystal Nuñez had sex
with three different men

19:03.272 --> 19:05.100
and failed to disclose that?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.971
- She was worried
about her ex-husband

19:07.015 --> 19:08.930
finding out
about her private life.

19:08.973 --> 19:12.238
- Because she was still having
sex with him?

19:12.281 --> 19:14.936
Look, how do we know
that this isn't just, uh,

19:14.979 --> 19:16.111
some kind of domestic dispute?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.634
- Her ex-husband
and the two other men

19:17.678 --> 19:19.854
she was with
that week alibied out.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.682
- So that's three.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.119
And what about this--this
ice cream vendor?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.469
- His DNA is not a match.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.733
But, Chief, the rapist may not
have left DNA.

19:29.777 --> 19:30.995
- She said he wore a condom.

19:31.039 --> 19:34.216
- Or there was no rape.
- Okay.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.218
Look,

19:36.262 --> 19:39.830
her three-year-old son was
in the bed next to her.

19:39.874 --> 19:43.791
