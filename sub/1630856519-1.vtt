00:07.666 --> 00:13.676
For sure, just like me, are in awe
by what happened this afternoon.

00:14.125 --> 00:20.904
A woman applauded, admired by
some, despised and even hated by others.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.166
But for no one was indifferent.

00:24.102 --> 00:27.488
And today it leaves
us with an important,

00:27.678 --> 00:30.696
controversial, difficult
to digest social debate.

00:41.964 --> 00:46.599
We come from far away, you
know? To visit the house of Fátima.

00:46.624 --> 00:49.223
We still can't believe
that she's no longer with us.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.475
In such a violent world,
someone who dares to break oneself

00:52.500 --> 00:56.000
and show us her
tenderness is very admirable.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.584
Frankly, I don't feel capable
of it and if she did something,

00:58.608 --> 01:02.444
for sure, I don't know, they
drugged her or something.

01:02.477 --> 01:04.888
I mean, she would be incapable.

01:06.372 --> 01:10.054
I think the media should also
take responsibility for all this

01:11.221 --> 01:12.207
and doing their part.

01:12.493 --> 01:15.541
This is the typical
story of the spoiled brat

01:15.565 --> 01:17.729
who is victimized because
they spoke ugly to her.

01:17.754 --> 01:22.362
It makes me sad to see women
here protesting for a stupid cause.

01:23.526 --> 01:27.268
I'm tired to live in a country where they
glorify the person who humiliates oneself,

01:27.292 --> 01:29.123
where the most famous
is the most superficial.

01:31.670 --> 01:32.959
I want to live in a country

01:33.023 --> 01:38.213
in which they applaud the women who work
our asses off every day. Not this crap.

01:38.355 --> 01:44.503
Let her go, excuseme , I'm here
to boost you, ok? Please hold on.

01:45.946 --> 01:48.619
It is Fátima, a
reflection of our culture.

01:50.208 --> 01:52.438
From the current
moment in our society.

01:53.916 --> 01:56.366
This event undoubtedly
opens up a debate.

01:57.333 --> 02:01.442
In the meantime, rest
in peace Fátima Ferreira.

04:26.375 --> 04:30.459
Reggie. Is that you?
Why are you crying, love?

04:31.185 --> 04:32.218
What’s up with you?

04:33.558 --> 04:35.558
You are going to
scold me if I tell you.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.576
No, I promise I won't scold
you. Open the door to me, please.

04:40.458 --> 04:41.824
What's going on?

04:42.919 --> 04:45.619
I secretly bought a cell phone.

04:45.833 --> 04:46.833
Okay.

04:47.625 --> 04:52.123
And Juliana stole it from me
and wrote messages to Sofi Fojo.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.852
Who is Sofi Fojo?

04:55.097 --> 04:58.868
-She's a famous girl.
-And then.

04:59.500 --> 05:05.125
She wrote I was in love with her and that I
was excited to see her and stuff like that.

05:07.584 --> 05:08.985
Juliana Montes.

05:26.741 --> 05:28.009
Juliana Montes.

05:28.958 --> 05:29.958
What.

05:30.541 --> 05:32.881
Why did you steal
Regina's cell phone?

05:33.751 --> 05:37.420
I didn't steal it from her. I took it away
because cell phones are forbidden.

05:38.815 --> 05:42.700
And who gave you the right to write
things about sex to her friend Sofi?

05:44.291 --> 05:47.203
Sofi is not her friend,
she's an influencer.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.363
Do you know social networks?

05:49.931 --> 05:50.931
Freak.

05:51.416 --> 05:52.416
Oh!

05:54.082 --> 05:55.359
What did you said to me?

05:55.594 --> 05:59.670
Chill, woman. Why don't you go play with
girls your age? Give me the cell phone.

06:01.146 --> 06:03.521
-I'm not going to give you anything.
-I said give it to me.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.760
Don't touch me!

06:06.564 --> 06:08.091
Fucking retard.

06:21.063 --> 06:24.776
Mr. Ferreira, we really
value your donations.

06:25.291 --> 06:29.328
But I'm sorry. Fatima will no longer
be able to volunteer at the orphanage.

06:30.392 --> 06:33.776
She is unstable and
puts the institute at risk.

06:51.539 --> 06:54.192
You know the social media freak?

06:55.927 --> 06:58.927
Yes, I do know them.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.241
And freak, your mother.

07:21.369 --> 07:23.536
-Did you take the pill?
-Yes.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.449
Have a good night.

07:25.509 --> 07:26.509
Hey.

07:30.725 --> 07:32.545
I want to have a cell phone.

07:33.399 --> 07:35.133
Even children have one.

07:37.922 --> 07:39.933
To talk to and send messages.

07:40.033 --> 07:41.033
To whom?

07:42.857 --> 07:43.975
to Whoever.

07:44.941 --> 07:51.227
Fati, don't you remember what happened
the last time you wanted to have friends?

07:57.124 --> 07:59.868
I'm going to have lunch with
some producers. Yes, dad.

08:00.541 --> 08:04.522
-I love you.
-Me too, i'll be back at night.

08:21.767 --> 08:22.885
Hello.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.333
10,000.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.416
10,500.

08:28.731 --> 08:29.750
11,000.

08:29.750 --> 08:30.958
11,500.

08:31.076 --> 08:32.082
12,000.

08:32.107 --> 08:33.357
12,500.

08:34.416 --> 08:36.158
Hello. Hello.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.577
Thank you.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.484
Today, on Valentine's
day,

08:57.508 --> 09:02.091
Cami and I are going to say one
thing that we admire about each other.

09:02.808 --> 09:07.658
Well, I'm going to start with
what I admire about Sofi,

09:08.232 --> 09:13.315
it's her creativity to create
every outfit for every occasion.

09:13.340 --> 09:15.273
I love her with all my heart.

09:15.298 --> 09:17.565
I love you, bestie.

09:18.124 --> 09:22.160
About Cami I love that
she always looks good.

09:22.441 --> 09:26.725
Literally, I mean, she looks good, I
mean, she makes everything work.

09:32.457 --> 09:37.002
I must confess yesterday I
broke up with my boyfriend.

09:37.874 --> 09:40.691
Because I realized that
it was a toxic relationship

09:40.982 --> 09:46.891
and that even if I deeply love that
person, I must not allow him to abuse me.

09:47.250 --> 09:50.226
And not just
physically, my spirit.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.611
I want to confess, yesterday

10:29.636 --> 10:33.270
I broke up with my boyfriend because I
realized that it was a very toxic relationship.

10:35.693 --> 10:40.276
And even though I deeply
love this person,

10:42.489 --> 10:46.073
I cannot allow him to abuse not
only my body, but also my spirit.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.132
What happened, Fatima?

11:00.583 --> 11:02.380
Director, I need to go back.

11:02.405 --> 11:04.163
It's not going to be possible.
Fatima.

11:04.474 --> 11:05.863
You hit a girl.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.774
The gossip spread
and child services came.

11:08.607 --> 11:10.074
You got us into
a lot of trouble.

11:10.916 --> 11:13.530
But I've been
working here for years.

11:13.705 --> 11:15.375
I miss the girls so much.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.220
I can't even sleep.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.300
You have to go.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.295
Just by being here,
you put us at risk.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.769
No, please, give me
another chance, pretty please,

11:22.793 --> 11:23.930
please go away.

11:48.776 --> 11:52.874
If sadness has kidnapped you,
realize that you are not that feeling.

11:53.758 --> 11:58.165
That's an indicator that your soul is in a
spiritual place that doesn't belong to you.

11:59.166 --> 12:03.199
Remember that you are designed
to feel love and compassion.

12:05.333 --> 12:09.274
If you think that you are an ant in this world and
that you are insignificant, that is not the case.

12:09.324 --> 12:11.083
It's not true.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.303
You are a very valuable person.

12:13.850 --> 12:18.464
You have to trust yourself,
trust your talents, trust your heart.

12:18.774 --> 12:20.607
You have to understand
that you're worthy.

12:21.357 --> 12:24.778
We live in a world that wants
to murder your inner child.

12:24.857 --> 12:28.974
You are responsible for treasuring
it, caring for it, nourishing it.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.734
Learn to trust your body.

12:30.759 --> 12:32.666
Learn to trust your
heart, your soul.

12:32.666 --> 12:35.141
Recover your strength,
your confidence, your joy.

12:35.166 --> 12:38.578
Come to my face-to-face courses, you
will see that you won't be disappointed.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.100
Welcome.

13:10.308 --> 13:11.758
It doesn't matter who you are.

13:11.799 --> 13:13.708
-Namaste.
-Thank you.

13:13.740 --> 13:15.229
It doesn't matter
where you live.

13:15.533 --> 13:19.264
The design of the universe is so
wonderful that we have no escape.

13:21.133 --> 13:26.812
Everyone, absolutely everyone, are
going to feel sadness, abandonment,

13:28.015 --> 13:29.112
anger.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.807
We're going to get hit.

13:32.495 --> 13:34.414
Now if you ask me.

13:34.750 --> 13:35.966
What is success?

13:36.333 --> 13:37.570
How do we measure success?

13:37.750 --> 13:43.259
I would tell them that when I see an old woman
or an old man smiling with the eyes of a child.

13:43.292 --> 13:44.434
That is success.

13:46.149 --> 13:49.497
A person who went through
his whole life with his soul intact.

13:51.166 --> 13:54.968
What did that soul do to
protect its vibrating energy?

13:57.099 --> 14:01.180
But here are beautiful,
very different faces.

14:01.866 --> 14:06.780
I feel the desire they have
to feel love, to give love.

14:08.583 --> 14:09.832
For example, you.

14:11.899 --> 14:12.899
Yes.

14:15.116 --> 14:16.644
What's your name, my girl.

14:16.978 --> 14:18.016
Fátima.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.041
Fátima.

14:19.366 --> 14:21.216
Could you stand
up, please, Fátima.

14:23.916 --> 14:25.497
Do you want to come
to the front with me?

14:27.191 --> 14:28.239
Come.

14:36.541 --> 14:37.670
Hello Fátima.

14:37.857 --> 14:38.857
Hello.

14:39.666 --> 14:42.576
Fátima, I see fear
and pain in your eyes.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.128
And that fear and that pain
have you stuck and confused.

14:47.332 --> 14:49.286
Tell me what causes
you so much pain?

14:51.630 --> 14:52.718
I don't know.

14:55.691 --> 14:56.795
Close your eyes.

14:57.791 --> 15:03.049
Now I'm honest with you, and without thinking about
it. Tell me what is it that causes you so much pain?

15:05.191 --> 15:06.315
My mom.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.291
Your mother?

15:12.058 --> 15:13.358
My mom died.

15:14.607 --> 15:15.943
And how did your mother die?

15:23.715 --> 15:25.615
My mom committed suicide.

15:26.090 --> 15:27.327
Oh my God.

15:28.323 --> 15:31.081
She killed herself
when I was a child.

15:33.158 --> 15:35.331
And do you know why your
mommy commited suicide?

15:37.091 --> 15:39.975
I don't know. I
think she was sick.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.308
I think she was depressed.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.977
But they didn't want to say.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.875
Let's see.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.254
Close your eyes.

15:50.966 --> 15:55.083
We're going to talk to that little Fátima
who's there. Very stuck and confused.

16:01.232 --> 16:03.430
We're going to talk
to that little Fátima.

16:04.182 --> 16:07.149
She's stuck and
confused, very confused.

16:14.458 --> 16:20.957
Dear little Fátima, from now
on you will live incomplete.

16:24.941 --> 16:27.495
No one turns out unhurt
from the death of a mother.

16:28.883 --> 16:31.822
And I know you're wondering
why she left without you.

16:34.191 --> 16:36.972
But I come here to tell you
something of the most important.

16:38.091 --> 16:43.107
Your mom loved you, and
you're a girl who deserves love.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.759
You deserve abundant love.

16:55.632 --> 16:57.559
I deserve endless love.

16:57.632 --> 16:58.632
Very good.

16:58.949 --> 17:00.551
Now say it louder.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.600
I deserve endless love.

17:03.625 --> 17:04.907
You tell your inner girl.

17:05.886 --> 17:08.595
Fati, you deserve endless love.

17:08.625 --> 17:09.980
Now shout it out.

17:10.250 --> 17:12.872
I deserve endless love.

17:16.341 --> 17:18.653
I deserve endless love.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.107
I deserve endless love.

17:53.325 --> 17:54.465
Let's get started.

17:58.516 --> 18:01.609
Who is the most important
person for Fátima?

18:04.841 --> 18:06.013
My dad.

18:07.015 --> 18:09.530
Your father? Yes.

18:10.707 --> 18:11.733
And why?

18:12.916 --> 18:19.747
Because he takes care of me. He buys
me my clothes and gives me my pills.

18:23.274 --> 18:25.411
Now, without much thought.

18:25.949 --> 18:29.270
You're going to bring back the most
important memories with your father.

18:31.083 --> 18:35.855
And you are going to tell me if
they are pretty or if they're ugly.

18:36.750 --> 18:37.824
Ugly.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.568
Do you know
what I'd like to see?

18:41.976 --> 18:43.047
What?

18:43.763 --> 18:47.276
That the most important
person for Fátima is Fátima.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.538
And that Fátima
takes care of Fátima.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.961
I think Fátima has
not yet been born.

18:57.041 --> 19:02.190
I think this Fátima is a completely
anesthetized and suppressed version of Fátima.

19:04.099 --> 19:11.455
And you know it would be a tragedy,
that Fátima dies without being born.

19:15.107 --> 19:16.255
Wake up.

19:20.547 --> 19:23.595
Fátima, do you happen to have any
of those pills your father gives you?

19:23.619 --> 19:25.467
I'd love to know
what's in them.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.505
Yes i do.

19:27.766 --> 19:28.766
Give me one.

19:33.299 --> 19:34.299
This one?

19:54.541 --> 19:55.678
Master Ferreira.

19:55.702 --> 19:58.953
How do you feel that
after almost 30 years,

19:58.978 --> 20:03.051
the refugees remain an
emblematic work for our cinema?

20:03.541 --> 20:06.185
I have a great affection
for the refugees.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.927
It opened a lot of doors for me.

20:08.391 --> 20:09.707
Thanks to her,

20:09.739 --> 20:14.755
I have been able to have the opportunity to
express myself for more than three decades.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.436
It has been the great
fortune of my career.

20:18.024 --> 20:25.555
Master, why you think this film still
feels fresh and current even today?

20:32.415 --> 20:36.257
Human passions are eternal.

20:36.416 --> 20:38.928
Human passions are eternal.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.107
Of course.

20:45.584 --> 20:48.928
Cinematography is the only discipline
with which I have understood myself.

20:49.348 --> 20:52.027
It's the only thing that
gives meaning to my life.

20:53.399 --> 20:55.583
I owe my life to
cinematography,

20:55.978 --> 21:00.667
only through the lens
have I found inner peace.

21:02.475 --> 21:04.867
Fátima. I'm very sorry about

21:05.204 --> 21:08.799
what i'm going to say, but I feel like
your father hasn't done a great job.

21:11.115 --> 21:15.671
And even if he feels that he is protecting you,
honestly this is the reason of your loneliness.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.827
And I want to see
Fátima at its full potential.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.172
Let's see. Close your eyes.

21:29.791 --> 21:32.518
Imagine Fátima loving a man.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.641
Picture Fátima having
a beautiful orgasm.

21:50.274 --> 21:52.520
Imagine Fátima having a child.

22:05.383 --> 22:10.720
All these images are energy from your
potential, you just have to wake them up.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.962
And we're doing
it this afternoon.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.772
Open your eyes.

22:16.708 --> 22:17.808
This afternoon.

22:17.916 --> 22:21.049
Do it without questioning,
the first thing you want.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.916
Do what your soul
asks, without reservation.

22:23.916 --> 22:25.122
I don't care what it is.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.708
-It's okay?
-Ok.

22:26.708 --> 22:27.770
Ok.

22:28.016 --> 22:29.891
And the chemical
composition of your pills?

22:29.916 --> 22:31.845
You'll get results
in a few weeks

22:32.254 --> 22:35.249
What I feel is that it would be good if
you stopped taking them for a few days.

22:35.981 --> 22:37.399
Then tell me how
you feel whithout them.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.506
If anything happens
you call me, okay?

22:40.083 --> 22:42.808
If my dad asks me about my
pills, what should I tell him?

22:42.833 --> 22:44.083
Fuck your father.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.849
Fátima, please.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.045
It's your life.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.387
It's your body.

22:50.140 --> 22:51.190
What do you want?

22:53.491 --> 22:54.999
Well yes, it's my life.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.833
It's your life.

22:57.833 --> 22:58.862
And it's my body.

22:58.916 --> 22:59.916
And it's your body.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.416
It's me.

23:02.674 --> 23:03.674
It's you.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.435
-It's my life.
-It's my life.

23:06.460 --> 23:08.281
-It's my body.
-It's my body.

23:08.306 --> 23:10.024
-It's me.
-It's me.

23:10.074 --> 23:11.922
-It's my life.
-My life.

23:11.972 --> 23:12.972
My body.

23:13.291 --> 23:17.472
Look at that beautiful smile that is
showing up and that spark in your eyes.

23:18.541 --> 23:20.372
It's my life.
It's my body.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.625
It's my life.
It's my body.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.333
It's me.
It's my life.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.083
It's my body.
It's me.

23:26.083 --> 23:28.791
It's my life. It's
my body. It's me.

23:28.816 --> 23:30.466
My life, is my body.

23:30.491 --> 23:31.491
It's me.

23:36.732 --> 23:39.232
It's my life, It's
my body, it's me.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.125
It's life. It's my
body. It's me.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.291
Hello, how are you?

24:09.333 --> 24:11.524
There are three
people connected.

24:12.282 --> 24:13.491
Welcome.

24:20.799 --> 24:24.485
Felix Perro says show your tits.

24:27.998 --> 24:30.485
Not right now, thank you.

24:32.541 --> 24:34.165
Any other questions?

24:36.183 --> 24:40.710
Lorena87, thank
you for joining us.

24:41.099 --> 24:43.106
I would like to know
more about you.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.800
Yes.

24:47.825 --> 24:49.606
Yes.
We can be friends.

24:52.374 --> 24:57.577
My favorite color is
purple and sometimes pink.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.142
This woman is nuts.

25:09.149 --> 25:13.108
No, to be honest i've
never had a boyfriend.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.724
Of course I'd like to.

25:20.949 --> 25:23.008
I hope to one day
have a boyfriend.

25:30.691 --> 25:32.121
What would I like
to do with him?

25:34.250 --> 25:38.644
Well, I'd like to go to
the movies with him.

25:40.041 --> 25:41.329
Talk to him.

25:44.183 --> 25:45.706
Stroke his penis.

25:51.412 --> 25:52.962
She said stroke his penis?

25:55.307 --> 25:58.558
This woman is a treasure,
I told you, she is nuts.

26:01.629 --> 26:03.819
Look at this lady is
really fucked up, right?

26:04.075 --> 26:05.748
-Yes.
-Should we do it?

26:05.773 --> 26:06.790
Arre!

26:06.815 --> 26:08.531
Stroke his penis.
Stroke his penis.

26:11.007 --> 26:12.819
Go to the movies with him.

26:13.048 --> 26:14.617
Talk to him.

26:14.958 --> 26:17.067
Stroke his penis.

26:17.749 --> 26:20.523
Penis, penis, penis.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.490
What is your favorite color?

26:22.515 --> 26:23.731
His penis.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.596
Go to the movies with him.

26:26.832 --> 26:28.619
Talk to him.

26:28.644 --> 26:31.052
Stroke his penis.

26:32.669 --> 26:34.069
Go to the movies with him.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.326
Go to the movies with him.

26:35.351 --> 26:36.842
Go to the movies with him.

26:38.424 --> 26:45.406
Talk to him, Stroke his penis, stroke his
penis, stroke his penis, stroke his penis.

26:46.799 --> 26:48.065
I think that.

26:49.807 --> 26:52.387
I think I would like
to be an Influencer.

26:54.942 --> 26:56.358
Do you want to be an influencer?

26:56.616 --> 26:58.946
Be an influencer,
no matter what it is,

26:58.987 --> 27:01.591
what matters is that you
do it with all your passion.

27:13.460 --> 27:19.121
If sadness has kidnapped you,
realize that you are not that feeling.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.891
I am a magical being
who is waking up.

27:22.735 --> 27:24.708
I order Endless Love.

27:24.916 --> 27:28.169
I order, wisdom and
intrinsic feminism.

27:28.323 --> 27:32.839
Reconnect with your divine essence
and break through the veils of illusion.

27:37.333 --> 27:41.548
We live in a world that wants
to murder your inner child.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.895
Just as you hear it.

27:44.756 --> 27:47.344
That feeling is
only an indicator

27:47.375 --> 27:52.075
that your soul does not belong to
the spiritual place where you are.

27:52.257 --> 27:56.293
You are responsible for
treasuring it, caring for it

27:56.334 --> 28:02.825
and nourishing it, so that you can
access the path of enlightenment.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.908
If we are faithful
to our essence.

28:06.891 --> 28:10.756
We'll receive, infinite love.

28:18.500 --> 28:23.233
I love you so much, Fati.

28:44.479 --> 28:46.750
Once again your
smile brightens my day.

28:46.791 --> 28:49.492
Thank you so much
Fátima, I love you.

28:50.954 --> 28:53.965
Simply my favorite
lady, let nothing stop you.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.196
We love you.

28:55.756 --> 28:56.944
I love you Fati.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.027
No one like you, you
are my favorite woman.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.223
Fátima, you're an asshole.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.336
I see you and I lose
my faith in humanity.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.127
Hello, Felix.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.967
I'd like to talk to you.

29:26.625 --> 29:27.702
Hello, slut.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.850
Why dont you like me?

29:35.752 --> 29:40.250
'Cacuse your an idiot,
false and opportunistic.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.325
I don't think you know me.

29:45.866 --> 29:47.164
If I give you the chance
to get to know me,

29:47.188 --> 29:49.665
you would realize that I
am not that kind of person.

29:52.491 --> 29:54.525
I don't know if meeting
you is a good idea.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.308
I don't know if I can
handle the urge to hit you.

29:57.333 --> 29:58.692
Fucking Whore.

30:30.183 --> 30:32.625
I don't know if I can
handle the urge to hit you.

30:38.333 --> 30:39.844
Fucking whore.

30:43.333 --> 30:47.458
Dude, one of my stalkers gave
me 422 likes photo by photo,.

30:47.614 --> 30:49.283
Get a life bitch.

30:49.390 --> 30:56.809
I agree, someone let her know,
please, she is not in age to twerk.

30:57.553 --> 30:59.603
Not even Buenfil
dare to do such a thing.

30:59.907 --> 31:00.907
Let me see, she's hot.

31:05.317 --> 31:06.759
Shut up, idiot!

31:07.840 --> 31:09.040
Tell me her name.

31:09.291 --> 31:10.382
Fati Ferri.

31:15.373 --> 31:18.913
The bastard has ten posts and
already has 50,000 followers.

31:21.740 --> 31:24.293
I love it when people
lose their dignity for likes.

31:24.331 --> 31:25.561
Yes, I'm gonna follow her.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.545
-Follow...
-times two.

31:37.486 --> 31:38.845
Hello beautiful, how are you?

31:38.870 --> 31:40.500
Good, good.
Hey.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.915
Did I called you worried,

31:42.315 --> 31:46.238
Did you saw that your daughter is
uploading content to the social media.

31:46.432 --> 31:47.446
What.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.833
you didnt know?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.425
Fátima doesn't
have a cell phone.

31:51.982 --> 31:54.265
Oh, sweetheart!

31:54.957 --> 31:57.410
Well, she already has
almost 50,000 followers.

31:57.799 --> 32:00.098
And she's moving
her butt and everything.

32:00.616 --> 32:02.096
Don't fuck with me.

32:44.391 --> 32:45.391
Fátima.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.652
Sofi Fojo is following me.

32:49.374 --> 32:50.390
Fátima,

32:59.084 --> 33:00.117
Fátima.

33:07.273 --> 33:09.187
Let's see, Lulu, I
don't understand you.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.237
What do you mean when
you say she's wiggling her butt?

33:14.250 --> 33:15.940
But what's twerking?

34:02.499 --> 34:04.020
I want to confess something.

34:05.449 --> 34:11.017
I'm happy because I'm getting to know
myself in a way I've never done before.

34:13.349 --> 34:15.379
Today i embrace my sexuality.

34:20.217 --> 34:23.537
I love myself deeply
and I want to thank you

34:24.162 --> 34:27.383
because I feel the
confidence to be myself.

34:29.090 --> 34:30.369
I love you, family.

34:30.577 --> 34:31.683
And remember.

34:31.708 --> 34:35.404
We're infinit love.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.062
I don't know what's worse.

34:40.983 --> 34:44.356
To see a minor been
used as a sexual object.

34:46.649 --> 34:50.752
Or to see a menopausal
pretending to be a minor.

34:57.582 --> 35:02.356
Dude, this woman is gaining 100,000
followers in two days, she's everywhere.

35:04.957 --> 35:06.565
Search, her
username is Fati Ferri.

35:08.024 --> 35:09.152
She's nuts.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.679
Fucking woman.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.665
She'll know they're making fun
of her, or she'll do it on purpose.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.598
Obviously it's on purpose.

35:21.716 --> 35:22.894
I dont think so.

35:24.549 --> 35:28.390
It seems to me that this woman
is a treasure and we can use her.

35:29.132 --> 35:30.132
How come?

35:30.791 --> 35:33.604
Lets ask her out and
we mess with her.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.750
We have to take this
thing to the next level.

35:36.775 --> 35:38.275
Sof, you are crazy, dude.

35:40.494 --> 35:42.519
The social media
has no limit as well.

35:43.316 --> 35:44.462
And you know it.

35:45.091 --> 35:46.091
fuck!

35:46.399 --> 35:48.154
-I'm going to send her a message.
-Let's see.

35:54.375 --> 35:55.908
Hello Fati.

35:59.544 --> 36:03.608
fuck, she answers me
very quickly, what a freak!

36:05.167 --> 36:06.375
I'm your fan.

36:06.375 --> 36:08.258
Oh no, how sweet!

36:09.191 --> 36:10.608
I'm also your fan.

36:14.835 --> 36:16.110
Seriously?

36:24.875 --> 36:26.225
What if we asked her out?

36:26.398 --> 36:27.416
Ok.

36:27.416 --> 36:28.416
Yes.

36:36.983 --> 36:38.450
-Today!
-Yes.

36:39.015 --> 36:43.304
Ok. I'm going out with
Cami, my best friend.

36:52.217 --> 36:54.450
You should come, we'll
see you at nine in Sandoy.

37:00.126 --> 37:01.444
Where is it?

37:02.283 --> 37:03.908
Dude, google it.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.719
And get pretty.

37:09.341 --> 37:10.837
It's all done.

37:24.982 --> 37:26.975
Fati, we are here.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.500
-Hi.
-How are you?

37:33.632 --> 37:34.632
Hi.

37:35.410 --> 37:36.758
Nice to meet you.

37:37.367 --> 37:38.808
Nice to meet you.

37:39.117 --> 37:40.500
Nice to meet you.

37:42.266 --> 37:43.510
Do you want something to drink?

37:44.582 --> 37:45.791
A juice.

37:46.445 --> 37:48.629
-A juice?
-try this out.

37:48.654 --> 37:51.023
Man, would you bring
us another gin, please.

37:55.521 --> 37:57.894
I'm sorry I'm a little nervous,.

37:57.934 --> 37:59.135
Calm down.

37:59.241 --> 38:01.617
It's a dream for me to know you.
Seriously.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.673
If you keep talking like
this, we're going to regret it.

38:09.223 --> 38:10.336
Like a fan.

38:15.224 --> 38:16.817
-Be yourself.
-Let's see.

38:16.842 --> 38:18.854
That's why people
love you, right?

38:19.941 --> 38:21.525
Because you're authentic.

38:21.750 --> 38:22.883
Do you think so?

38:23.225 --> 38:24.664
Oh, please don't mess with us.

38:24.689 --> 38:26.540
You know perfectly
well that people love you.

38:28.541 --> 38:35.862
Well yes, yes, the truth is that its been
amazing, but I also have very rude people.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.146
Yes, your haters.

38:37.295 --> 38:38.790
But not anymore, I've
already block them.

38:38.815 --> 38:39.929
-What?
-What?

38:41.416 --> 38:43.979
-No, no.
-No, no, don't block them, silly.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.206
-Why?
-Because you need them.

38:47.406 --> 38:50.233
-They give you action,.
-What?

38:50.258 --> 38:54.698
Your haters criticize you and then your
fans come and spend time defending you.

38:55.771 --> 38:59.373
There it is.
If you become a relevant person.

39:00.299 --> 39:02.687
The thing is, they spend
their time insulting me.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.910
Yes, and has anyone
already defended you?

39:06.416 --> 39:07.462
Yes.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.371
Congrats.

39:11.208 --> 39:13.037
You're already building
your community.

39:13.916 --> 39:17.243
Let's see. Every army
needs an enemy to fight.

39:18.192 --> 39:20.254
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

39:20.384 --> 39:21.910
-Ok.
-Ok.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.737
Now unblock it, woman.

39:25.316 --> 39:26.316
Go!

39:27.207 --> 39:28.507
There is only one rule.

39:29.537 --> 39:31.000
You never answer them.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.250
-Okay?
-Ok.

39:32.275 --> 39:34.098
Let your fans do all the work.

39:34.524 --> 39:35.524
Ok.

39:47.556 --> 39:48.754
Do you want a hit?

39:50.424 --> 39:51.723
It has a surprise.

39:52.566 --> 39:53.566
What?

39:56.433 --> 39:57.433
Yes.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Fátima.

42:10.672 --> 42:11.760
Dad!

42:12.883 --> 42:14.552
Excuse me.

42:14.810 --> 42:15.949
Calm down.

42:15.974 --> 42:19.035
Lets go I didn't want
to come, i swear.

42:27.875 --> 42:30.262
-Come, sweety.
-Where are we going, dad?

42:30.583 --> 42:32.237
Don't worry.
Come with me.

42:37.791 --> 42:39.685
Let's go.
Go with your mom.

42:41.083 --> 42:42.258
Hello, mommy.

42:42.689 --> 42:43.781
Hello, Fati.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.416
Lie here.
Little girl.

42:45.416 --> 42:47.125
-Are you sure?
-Yes, my love.

42:47.125 --> 42:48.916
-What is this for?
-Don't worry.

42:48.916 --> 42:50.760
It's all going to be so fast.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.635
It's not going to hurt.
Right mom?

42:53.277 --> 42:55.293
Quiet, calm down,
calm down, Fati.

42:55.416 --> 42:56.643
It's not going to hurt you.

42:56.791 --> 42:59.408
You're only going to feel a
few tickling here on the head.

42:59.666 --> 43:00.958
All of this is for
your own good.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.579
-Right, Mommy?
-Yes.

43:03.099 --> 43:04.881
We're going to do
a little discharge

43:04.913 --> 43:09.284
to balance your meditative focus
and say goodbye to all your attacks.

43:09.332 --> 43:10.332
Agree?

43:10.466 --> 43:13.070
I don't want tickles.
Mommy, please.

43:13.875 --> 43:15.168
-Ok.
-Ok.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.830
-we are going to film.
-Yes, sir.

43:16.855 --> 43:19.093
I want the camera
here but I want it open.

43:19.355 --> 43:23.124
Okay, recording sound,
recording camera, 99 set, take 11.

43:23.316 --> 43:24.316
Brand.

43:25.197 --> 43:26.625
-Mommy!
-Charge.

43:26.625 --> 43:27.625
Action.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.545
Discharge.

43:30.308 --> 43:32.415
3 2 1.

43:34.772 --> 43:36.157
All right, all right.
Very good.

43:36.182 --> 43:37.543
But give me another one.

43:37.568 --> 43:39.375
-Don't stop the tape.
-This time with more pain.

43:39.511 --> 43:41.920
3 2 1.

43:43.111 --> 43:44.261
Cut.

43:45.076 --> 43:46.559
This is very interesting.

43:46.584 --> 43:49.649
I though this was comedy
but this is very creepy.

43:49.857 --> 43:51.066
-Yes.
-Right?

43:51.899 --> 43:53.780
I want a selfie
with the crazy lady.

43:55.116 --> 43:58.225
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

44:07.016 --> 44:08.016
Woman!

44:09.932 --> 44:10.932
Woman!

44:13.883 --> 44:14.883
Wake up!

44:16.277 --> 44:17.277
Wake up!

44:20.444 --> 44:22.877
Hello Sunshine.

44:23.667 --> 44:24.742
Where am i?

44:24.767 --> 44:29.381
Don't worry, we're at Sofi's house,
except yesterday you got wasted.

44:30.375 --> 44:32.968
-Yuri woke up already?
-yes,

44:34.525 --> 44:38.931
Good morning beautiful lady, today
we have media day.

44:39.215 --> 44:40.647
What's media day?

44:55.319 --> 44:59.458
I love you. I need to
say goodbye, i love you.

45:18.198 --> 45:19.355
We are late.

45:39.987 --> 45:41.933
100K followes in a month
and a growth of 10,000 per day.

45:41.958 --> 45:43.371
Ok.
It looks good.

45:43.831 --> 45:45.100
-Alright.
-Thank you.

45:45.125 --> 45:46.125
Alright?

45:46.639 --> 45:48.375
Fati is a bomb.
Don't mess with us.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.235
Cami. We have to see if it is sustainable.
A lot of people drop in a month.

45:52.260 --> 45:54.250
-I'm not going to drop it.
-Ok.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.250
Let's see.

45:55.365 --> 45:57.698
At the agency there
are just 20-year-old girls.

45:57.933 --> 46:00.886
But what about brands
that want to sell washing machines,

46:01.532 --> 46:03.501
dryers, stoves,

46:03.643 --> 46:05.708
-refrigerators?
-And what?

46:05.928 --> 46:07.178
Let's see, tell me.

46:07.291 --> 46:09.461
How many old
inlfuencers do you have?

46:12.016 --> 46:14.799
zero, motherfucker, zero.

46:15.375 --> 46:16.486
First of all.

46:16.753 --> 46:18.583
Ouch!
Don't hit me.

46:19.498 --> 46:21.484
We see.

46:22.043 --> 46:25.516
I'm starting to be scared to get sick
by the mediocre virus of Generation X.

46:25.541 --> 46:27.668
-Thank you.
-Come on, Fati.

46:27.958 --> 46:30.301
Give me more, perfect.

46:32.291 --> 46:34.849
I love it.
Savage.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.511
Hair, hair, hair.
Very majestic.

46:40.991 --> 46:43.288
She's gorgeous.

46:43.574 --> 46:45.310
They can't stand it.

46:47.666 --> 46:49.145
Uh.

46:49.208 --> 46:51.216
Ok.
I spoke to the brand.

46:51.591 --> 46:53.377
They say let's take the
opportunity to record.

46:53.401 --> 46:55.422
And if they like your content,
they pay you for it.

46:56.291 --> 46:57.291
How much?

46:57.465 --> 47:00.737
-15,000 for post.
-Tell him 20.

47:02.083 --> 47:03.755
And 100 pesos
for each interaction.

47:04.591 --> 47:06.395
why you have to be such a bitch?

47:06.791 --> 47:10.951
Paquito. You also have to be a bitch,
so we can earn more everyone, right?

47:11.208 --> 47:14.188
You give me migraine.
Ok, go and get ready.

47:14.416 --> 47:16.586
And I'll see how much
I get from the brand.

47:17.949 --> 47:22.199
They're going to take pictures
and they're going to pay me?

47:22.599 --> 47:25.476
Yes Fati, or what do you
want to do with your followers?

47:25.676 --> 47:26.725
A family album?

47:26.750 --> 47:30.130
-The thing is i dont know how to pose.
-I'll show you.

47:32.099 --> 47:35.088
Aaaa, so good!

47:38.916 --> 47:41.529
I only drink Awi
because it's alkaline

47:41.553 --> 47:44.512
and my body smiles when
I give it good water.

47:45.149 --> 47:50.531
I only drink Awi water because
it's alkaline and my body smiles.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.002
-What?
-When I give it good water.

47:54.027 --> 47:56.041
When I give it good water.

47:56.125 --> 47:57.975
Yes, but smile Fati.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.127
Smile as if water
was a beautiful penis.

48:04.958 --> 48:06.802
Because it is Good water.

48:06.833 --> 48:11.158
Because it's alkaline and my
body smiles when give it good water.

48:12.708 --> 48:14.052
Hello, Jacky.

48:14.166 --> 48:15.702
Hello, Fátima.
How are you?

48:15.768 --> 48:16.774
Alright.

48:16.799 --> 48:19.041
Don't you know the things
that have happened to me?

48:19.250 --> 48:21.129
Pretty things or ugly things?

48:21.250 --> 48:22.250
Pretty!

48:22.758 --> 48:29.850
I already have friends and my networks have grown
a lot and well, I don't feel so alone anymore.

48:29.875 --> 48:31.666
And that's why you
haven't come to therapy?

48:32.690 --> 48:35.600
Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't go.

48:35.625 --> 48:37.339
Are you mad at me?

48:37.789 --> 48:40.202
No, it makes me very happy.

48:40.416 --> 48:41.762
But when you can, come.

48:41.787 --> 48:45.120
We need to continue working
on that beautiful soul you have.

48:45.333 --> 48:47.400
We have to go.
They are waiting for you.

48:48.224 --> 48:51.328
I have to leave you, because
they are going to take some pictures

48:51.353 --> 48:54.100
to promote a water which is
alkaline, and its good for your body.

48:54.125 --> 48:55.475
Can you believe it?

48:55.500 --> 48:56.674
It's okay.

48:57.333 --> 48:59.416
Go, no problem.
Keep working.

48:59.625 --> 49:00.625
Ok.

49:01.383 --> 49:02.559
I'll call you.

49:02.626 --> 49:04.916
Hey. Can you tell me your
user name in social networks?

49:04.916 --> 49:06.310
Fati Ferri.

49:06.458 --> 49:07.458
Ok.

49:07.625 --> 49:08.850
Kisses.

49:08.875 --> 49:09.875
Bye.

49:14.927 --> 49:16.041
Walaki.

49:16.041 --> 49:18.810
Bring me the kombucha
I ordered two hours ago.

49:19.474 --> 49:23.283
I'm on my way, fucking bitch.

49:26.246 --> 49:28.627
My love, lift you chin.

49:28.744 --> 49:30.325
Look at your right up here.

49:30.350 --> 49:31.512
Very good.

49:31.537 --> 49:33.454
Turn the label.
We want to see the water.

49:33.654 --> 49:36.208
Turn the turn. Like
this. Now smile.

49:36.208 --> 49:38.702
That's it, pretty one.

49:38.979 --> 49:41.931
That's the way, you
are amazing, like this.

49:41.956 --> 49:43.808
Smile.

49:44.150 --> 49:47.540
Drink water like a river.
Feel it.

49:47.791 --> 49:49.416
Sensual.
Sensual.

49:51.148 --> 49:58.154
As the goddess of hydration and
well-being that you are. My love.

49:58.679 --> 50:00.808
Drink, love.

50:01.083 --> 50:03.058
You owe me one.

50:03.333 --> 50:04.633
Yes, Bitch.

50:04.798 --> 50:06.500
That's it.

50:06.500 --> 50:08.944
And 10% of every
weight that goes in.

50:09.412 --> 50:15.860
Beautiful, goddess of hydration
and well-being, my love .

50:16.742 --> 50:20.105
I'm at the airport
with my best friends,

50:20.347 --> 50:23.356
Cami and Sofi

50:23.380 --> 50:27.414
Well, i've never been
this close to the airplanes.

51:22.833 --> 51:25.022
I swear to you on my life that.
I don't know who he is.

51:25.055 --> 51:27.155
-Then where did he come from?
-I don't know. I don't know.

51:27.180 --> 51:30.728
I have no idea. We were having dinner and
he came to invite us something to drink.

51:30.892 --> 51:32.453
I don't even know his name.

51:32.916 --> 51:34.886
I swear to you, I'm
alone with Fati and Cami.

51:34.911 --> 51:36.545
If you want i can
call you on facetime.

51:39.391 --> 51:40.420
Hello.

51:42.053 --> 51:43.925
You see.

51:44.311 --> 51:46.770
Why do you show other
guys on your feed and not me?

51:46.795 --> 51:47.811
Don't fuck with me, Juan.

51:47.836 --> 51:49.370
I have so many posts with you.

51:49.395 --> 51:51.056
Besides, you know
perfectly well that every time

51:51.080 --> 51:53.284
I take a picture with you,
my followers go down.

51:53.309 --> 51:57.183
Of course, Sofia, because all the
guys who follow you want to fuck you.

51:57.208 --> 51:58.791
Okay and what do you
want me to do it huh?

51:58.875 --> 52:00.368
That's the way it
is and im not sorry.

52:00.934 --> 52:04.013
Or what you want me to delete all my
fucking accounts and go back to your maid

52:04.038 --> 52:07.043
who sweeps you, who clean you, who
washes your dishes so you don't be afraid.

52:07.250 --> 52:08.780
Don't say stupid things
Sofia,

52:08.804 --> 52:14.751
all I'm asking is that you please
don't fuck anyone like in fucking Tulum.

52:14.833 --> 52:15.983
Fucking Shit.

52:16.041 --> 52:18.818
Tulum was two fucking
years ago, two fucking years.

52:18.843 --> 52:21.112
For how long are you going to
keep fucking with me with this?

52:21.337 --> 52:23.495
I'm tired of this.
I asked you for forgiveness.

52:23.520 --> 52:26.555
I knelt, I begged, I told you
everything so you could forgive me.

52:26.755 --> 52:30.083
I'm sick of your insecurity
and your fucking sexism.

52:30.666 --> 52:34.961
Get yourself a fucking girlfriend with
five followers so you can be fucking happy.

52:35.115 --> 52:36.187
Bye.

52:42.416 --> 52:43.710
Are you all right, Sofi?

52:43.735 --> 52:45.135
Do you want to talk about it?

52:45.500 --> 52:46.500
I'm fucked up.

52:46.525 --> 52:49.226
Im tired. Sick of everything
beeing ruined by this bastard.

52:51.875 --> 52:53.420
You should separate.

52:54.291 --> 52:55.578
-What?
-Stop it!

52:56.291 --> 52:58.930
We're not going to let
him ruin our vacation.

52:59.424 --> 53:00.747
We're having a good time.

53:01.087 --> 53:03.200
-Let's take a picture.
-Yes.

53:05.842 --> 53:08.596
-Do you want a hug?
-Fati, please, not right now Come.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.665
I want to be in
the middle, move.

53:26.181 --> 53:30.505
The acclaimed film director Joaquín
Ferreira made no secret of his annoyance

53:30.530 --> 53:34.313
when he was asked about the
recent fame his daughter has gained.

53:34.338 --> 53:37.571
Thanks to certain suggestive
videos on social networks,

53:37.595 --> 53:42.614
where we see the 40-year-old woman
showing her sexuality like a teenager.

53:42.882 --> 53:45.986
Joaquín, what do you think about your
daughter dancing in underwear on social media?

53:46.375 --> 53:50.553
The truth is that I feel ashamed,
not only for my daughter.

53:50.916 --> 53:57.816
Back in my time, there were women who were
in pornography and that was their career.

53:57.991 --> 54:01.332
Prostitutes stood
on street corners.

54:01.758 --> 54:06.158
But today women have to
prostitute themselves,

54:06.182 --> 54:08.844
sell themselfs through social
networks with sexual photographs.

54:08.958 --> 54:11.812
They think that if they
don't show they don't exist.

54:24.131 --> 54:28.248
If Fatima were my daughter, I wouldn't
keep her locked in the basement.

54:28.708 --> 54:34.966
Having such a daughter is Joaquín's
penance for making boring movies.

54:35.291 --> 54:40.400
When I feel sad or defeated,
I go to Fati Ferri's profile

54:40.425 --> 54:46.128
to remember that there are people
100,000 times more stupid than me.

54:47.103 --> 54:48.653
Thank you, Fátima.

54:49.083 --> 54:52.374
Watching you lose your
dignity helps me not to lose mine.

54:55.032 --> 54:57.549
Do you think only you
can be famous or what?

54:57.583 --> 55:00.161
I don't know what you're
talking about, Fátima.

55:00.416 --> 55:03.601
I know you would love it
if I were still locked in the house

55:03.625 --> 55:06.933
and cooking and washing
your underwear but no.

55:06.958 --> 55:08.155
No, I didn't say that.

55:08.542 --> 55:09.870
-What I said was.
-And yes,

55:10.037 --> 55:14.979
I upload content to my networks and
sometimes my boobs peek out a little bit.

55:15.004 --> 55:17.141
But that doesn't make
me a prostitute, dad.

55:17.166 --> 55:20.057
So the next time you talk
about your daughter on TV,

55:20.081 --> 55:22.666
try to be a little
more kind, please.

55:27.500 --> 55:30.928
Ok, write down On the 19th you

It's in your email.

55:39.166 --> 55:42.810
Ok, write the 24th we

55:48.208 --> 55:52.343
Tonight I'm sending you the list of
lines to all the posts you need to upload.

55:53.408 --> 55:54.682
There are a lot of them?

55:56.116 --> 55:57.141
Why?

55:57.240 --> 56:00.425
My friends recommended
that I not saturate my networks.

56:04.866 --> 56:05.901
Ok.

56:08.476 --> 56:09.651
Surprise.

56:09.833 --> 56:13.375
I got you tonight a live with
Rocio Rojas from Editorial La Fem.

56:14.403 --> 56:19.682
Yes Today I can't
Pakis, it's girls night.

56:21.250 --> 56:24.238
-What?
-I'm having dinner with Sofi and Cam.

58:08.741 --> 58:09.916
Who is it?

58:10.591 --> 58:11.622
Fati

58:13.130 --> 58:15.399
Why such a fucking hurry?

58:19.291 --> 58:20.786
Hey.
What happened to you?

58:20.920 --> 58:22.145
I had a fight with Juan.

58:24.416 --> 58:25.693
Did he hit you?

58:25.718 --> 58:27.478
Please don't mess with me.

58:27.875 --> 58:29.093
This is awful.

58:29.750 --> 58:30.759
Will you let me help you?

58:30.784 --> 58:32.301
I'm ok, im going to
put some makeup.

58:32.326 --> 58:34.726
No, no, You have to
reduce inflammation.

58:35.132 --> 58:36.524
I'm fine, really.

58:36.549 --> 58:37.549
I'm used to it.

58:38.250 --> 58:40.497
Let me pamper you.
I know about this things.

58:40.666 --> 58:42.447
Really, there's nothing wrong.

58:42.472 --> 58:43.772
I heal fast.

58:43.916 --> 58:44.916
Don't worry.

58:45.125 --> 58:47.784
Close the swollen eye.
Its horrible.

58:47.900 --> 58:49.376
Dont put it, its
going to burn me.

58:49.875 --> 58:52.125
I'm going to get a towel.
Thank you.

59:09.291 --> 59:10.291
Hello Friends.

59:11.416 --> 59:15.147
I don't know how to talk to you about
this, but I think it's very important.

59:17.616 --> 59:22.168
Maybe one of you are suffering
from this situation and it could help.

59:30.945 --> 59:32.644
I have a friend
suffering violence,

59:32.668 --> 59:34.563
she's a friend that I love and it hurts
a lot to see her suffer.

59:35.746 --> 59:38.861
But what hurts me the most
is that she lets her boyfriend

59:38.886 --> 59:41.816
hit her because she doesn't have
the courage to get out of there.

59:41.923 --> 59:44.035
If you have a friend who is
suffering from this situation

59:44.059 --> 59:48.782
of psychological or physical
harm your job is to help her.

59:48.807 --> 59:50.311
What's wrong with you, idiot?

59:51.061 --> 59:52.459
What's wrong with you too?

59:52.484 --> 59:54.084
-Give me back my cell phone.
-I'm not going to give it to you.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.801
-Give it to me,.
-I'm not gonna give it to you.

59:55.826 --> 59:57.018
Sofi, give it to me.

59:57.849 --> 01:00:00.061
Sofi, Give it to me.

01:00:00.416 --> 01:00:02.441
Get out of my house, retard.

01:00:03.488 --> 01:00:05.113
Why are you talking
to me like that?

01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:07.353
How dare you talk about
my problems with Juan?

01:00:07.378 --> 01:00:10.384
-No, but I didn't say it was you.
-And what the fuck?

01:00:10.743 --> 01:00:14.747
It haven't even passed 5 minutes
and you are already sharing.

01:00:15.795 --> 01:00:17.311
Content for your
social networks?

01:00:17.336 --> 01:00:21.468
No, the thing is, I thought maybe
someone was going through this situation

01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:23.008
and I could help them.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:25.421
No one needs your help, Fátima.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.631
At what point did you
think you were the wise?

01:00:28.323 --> 01:00:30.850
You are a joke.
Everyone is making fun of you.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.304
Don't you realize that we've
been doing it for months?

01:00:33.424 --> 01:00:35.904
Juan, Cami, me
and all of the Internet.

01:00:36.071 --> 01:00:37.312
What are you talking about?

01:00:39.316 --> 01:00:41.377
Do you really think
you're our friend?

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:44.546
Yes.

01:00:45.041 --> 01:00:47.785
I can't believe it, Fátima.
Really, You are retarded!

01:00:49.007 --> 01:00:50.487
You're a joke, Fátima.

01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:52.946
Just that, a joke.

01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:56.058
The whole Internet is making fun
of you. That's why we invite you.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:57.402
That's not true.

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:00.127
Come in,

01:01:00.227 --> 01:01:04.452
everyone come to see the lady who is
capable of moving the ass on the internet.

01:01:10.025 --> 01:01:12.750
You are dead.
Stupid, really dead.

01:01:17.365 --> 01:01:19.974
Have you notice how
you treat your daughter?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.177
I can't believe you're so cruel.

01:01:28.358 --> 01:01:29.502
It's your daughter.

01:01:29.527 --> 01:01:31.825
-She's not sick.
-No, she's not sick.

01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:34.140
She's completely insane.

01:01:34.173 --> 01:01:36.654
-How can you say that?
-You can't see anything.

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:39.183
The only thing you can
see are your movies.

01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:40.304
Your stupid movies.

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:42.375
Don't you see your daughter? You
don't see it. What's wrong with her?

01:01:42.375 --> 01:01:44.679
From my stupid movies we are
able to eat and live in this house.

01:01:44.704 --> 01:01:46.500
I dont care.
I'm talking about our daughter.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.406
What does she have to do to
make you realize that she's sick?

01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:52.400
Don't you see how you talk to
her? You are traumatizing her.

01:01:52.425 --> 01:01:54.333
I'm sick and tired
of you, bastard!

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:56.244
I'm going to kill
you, motherfucker!

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:59.467
-I'm going to kill you!
-You don't have the balls!

01:01:59.791 --> 01:02:00.973
Do it.

01:02:05.869 --> 01:02:07.435
Fátima, Fátima!

01:02:10.285 --> 01:02:11.794
No, Fátima.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.500
Fátima.

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:17.866
Stop.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.998
Sofia, Fátima.

01:02:42.023 --> 01:02:43.929
What's going on,
please open the door.

01:03:02.662 --> 01:03:04.975
Sofia, my love, who did this?

01:03:05.624 --> 01:03:07.632
What did they do to you?

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.152
Is this is the first
time Juan beat Sofia?

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:08.754
No

01:04:09.871 --> 01:04:12.050
What kind of abuse did Sofia receive?

01:04:15.375 --> 01:04:16.431
Once.

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:20.337
Once they had a fight and
it left her with a black eye.

01:04:23.548 --> 01:04:25.809
But he never told anyone

01:04:28.919 --> 01:04:32.619
because she felt ashamed I
heard screams in Sofi's apartment

01:04:34.064 --> 01:04:37.329
and when I came in Juan was
beating her

01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:40.191
and I got in the middle
of the two of them

01:04:40.215 --> 01:04:43.898
and he took a knife out of the
kitchen and stabbed Sofi.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.452
And he was after me.

01:04:52.477 --> 01:04:55.057
But luckily I managed to defend
myself and he stabbed himself

01:04:55.327 --> 01:04:57.110
and by a miracle, I am here.

01:05:06.283 --> 01:05:08.196
We're still in the Polanco
neighborhood,

01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:10.959
where people were murdered
and it hasn't been confirmed.

01:05:17.231 --> 01:05:21.640
Sorry for interrupting Gonzalo, but it
seems that right now the Prosecutor's Office

01:05:21.674 --> 01:05:25.658
is about to give a statement about
the murder of the young Sofi Fojo.

01:05:25.683 --> 01:05:27.333
There's our correspondent.

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:29.481
We are live, we're
going to hear it.

01:05:29.506 --> 01:05:34.827
In conclusion, Juan Jonas Treviño is
the murderer of Sofía Fojales Ortiz

01:05:35.206 --> 01:05:37.143
and so, but in self-defense,

01:05:37.455 --> 01:05:41.064
it was how Miss Fátima Ferreira took
the life of the aggressor.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.465
That's all.
Thank you so much.

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:43.633
Camera two, check.

01:05:46.716 --> 01:05:48.484
Camera 3 check.

01:05:48.816 --> 01:05:51.949
Attentive to my instructions.
We're three minutes away.

01:05:52.058 --> 01:05:54.131
Talent has microphones on, sir.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.912
Tonight we're all very excited because
we are going to welcome a superstar.

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:24.184
She's very famous, but
she's also a warrior,

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:28.818
she's a hero, she is brave,
empowered, she's inspiring.

01:06:28.843 --> 01:06:33.270
Today is joining us
the famous Fati Ferri.

01:06:37.182 --> 01:06:39.232
Welcome.

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:42.592
We are excited to
have you with us tonight.

01:06:42.617 --> 01:06:45.311
You really look beautiful.

01:06:46.184 --> 01:06:47.527
I'm your fan.

01:06:47.552 --> 01:06:48.757
Thank you.

01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:52.259
-Welcome Fati, how nice to have you.
-Thank you.

01:06:52.284 --> 01:06:53.690
How do you feel?
How are you?

01:06:53.715 --> 01:06:57.832
Well, very happy to be here. And
I want to thank you for inviting me.

01:06:57.857 --> 01:07:01.257
No, thanks to you for coming.
We all know your story.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:04.304
We know what happened. We
all know what you had to face.

01:07:04.329 --> 01:07:07.413
How did you manage
to get out of this situation.

01:07:07.499 --> 01:07:13.306
Tell us, how have you been able to process
this event, this disagreement as well.

01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:14.529
How are you feeling today?

01:07:14.886 --> 01:07:21.844
Well, I still feel sad because my
best friend in the world, Sofi Fojo, died.

01:07:21.957 --> 01:07:26.667
But well, little by little I'm feeling
better and proud that I was brave.

01:07:26.692 --> 01:07:29.714
And the truth is that the
response from people

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:33.555
on all social networks has
been completely supportive.

01:07:33.632 --> 01:07:34.914
But I want you to tell me

01:07:34.938 --> 01:07:38.926
how you were able to handle that
sudden fame that came to your life?

01:07:38.959 --> 01:07:43.155
Suddenly they have thousands
of fans, followers, a lot of likes.

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:46.673
Well, it has been incredible
because when I was a little girl

01:07:46.848 --> 01:07:48.398
I wanted someone to like me.

01:07:48.423 --> 01:07:51.881
And all of a sudden, when I
discovered networks, I said wow.

01:07:51.906 --> 01:07:54.036
There's a lot of people who
loves me and put me likes.

01:07:54.061 --> 01:07:58.644
Of course you have likes, a lot of
followers and also a great opportunity.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:01.974
Because everyone loves you, that is,
everyone is with you, you have inspired us,

01:08:01.998 --> 01:08:05.408
you have taught us the value of moving
forward and besides, you don't know it.

01:08:05.433 --> 01:08:09.933
Also I did my job, I did my research and I know
that you sing and that you sing very nicely.

01:08:10.492 --> 01:08:11.675
Yes i do.

01:08:11.715 --> 01:08:13.831
I have been playing the
piano since I was a little girl

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:20.505
and I have composed different songs
such as Solecito and Cloud that Passes.

01:08:20.607 --> 01:08:23.353
Solecito!
Sing Solecito for us.

01:08:28.484 --> 01:08:29.501
Sing!

01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:30.991
What can you sing for us?

01:08:31.345 --> 01:08:33.318
Something simple, a capella.

01:08:34.624 --> 01:08:35.624
Yes!

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:36.983
Listen.

01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:18.274
Wow!
Excelent!

01:09:21.836 --> 01:09:24.786
Perfect, I'm your
fan, follow me.

01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:31.943
The magpie doing her stupid
jokes on national television.

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:34.649
I had my TV on
and I didn't know.

01:09:34.857 --> 01:09:39.926
I didn't know if it was Fátima
singing or my express pot exploding.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.157
Fucking idiot.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.070
Someone tell this lady
that she's already an adult.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.943
Her virus pathetic.

01:09:46.968 --> 01:09:48.968
It's even more
contagious than COVID.

01:09:49.358 --> 01:09:53.932
Watching you sing
only disgusted me.

01:09:54.158 --> 01:09:57.951
How do you not feel sorry for being
so repulsive, pathetic and banal.

01:09:57.976 --> 01:10:00.745
Kill yourself live.
Kill yourself live.

01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:04.149
Shoot yourself for being a slut.

01:10:07.157 --> 01:10:08.174
Stupid.

01:10:10.097 --> 01:10:11.180
Hello.
Walaki.

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:13.586
27, 43772.

01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:18.147
Yes, yes, to Buenos Aires,
Argentina. Yes, by the end of the month.

01:10:18.832 --> 01:10:19.832
Thank you.

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:22.016
Please send me
the printed tickets.

01:10:22.275 --> 01:10:23.275
Thank you.

01:10:24.807 --> 01:10:25.945
Hello, Jackie.

01:10:26.249 --> 01:10:27.278
Hello, Fátima.

01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:30.136
I'm not giving
you therapy today.

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:33.618
This is my lawyer,
Ernesto Mondragon.

01:10:34.466 --> 01:10:35.770
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:39.809
What I have to tell you
is very serious, Fátima.

01:10:42.199 --> 01:10:43.603
I'm going to have to sue you.

01:10:45.258 --> 01:10:46.258
What?

01:10:47.101 --> 01:10:49.060
That I'm going to
sue you for plagiarism.

01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:52.060
I didn't do anything.

01:10:52.118 --> 01:10:53.118
Oh, no?

01:10:54.135 --> 01:10:55.760
You stole everything
from me, Fátima.

01:10:55.976 --> 01:10:57.921
All my messages.

01:10:57.976 --> 01:11:00.758
You used my content to
replicate it on your networks.

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:02.643
My doctrine, my
helping dynamics.

01:11:02.643 --> 01:11:07.785
And you're making money with it on
television, on radio, on social networks.

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:08.929
Look, Miss.

01:11:09.376 --> 01:11:14.092
If sadness has kidnapped you
realize that you are not that feeling.

01:11:14.117 --> 01:11:17.664
We live in a world that
wants to kill to your inner child.

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:19.433
You are responsable
to tresure it.

01:11:19.458 --> 01:11:24.076
Don't you see what all I did was share
your knowledge to help more people?

01:11:24.101 --> 01:11:25.227
Yes, to help.

01:11:26.152 --> 01:11:27.634
You're shameless.

01:11:27.735 --> 01:11:30.202
And all the money
you're earning with brands.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.285
Okay, but I earned that.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.851
You earned it by copying
absolutely everything.

01:11:34.876 --> 01:11:38.377
Everything i do, you do
it exactly the same, bitch.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.451
Jackie don't call me like that.

01:11:42.501 --> 01:11:45.508
I call you a bitch, because
you're a bitch. That's what you are.

01:11:45.533 --> 01:11:46.881
Just a moment, ladies.

01:11:47.126 --> 01:11:51.291
Today's meeting is to negociate
an agreement and avoid a lawsuit.

01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:53.826
An agreement?

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:58.839
You have to share half of the
income you received by plagiarizing

01:11:59.164 --> 01:12:01.898
Miss Lombardo's knowledge.

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:05.075
Jackie, I love you very much.
What's wrong with you?

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.372
I don't love you.

01:12:06.543 --> 01:12:08.579
You are my patient
and I am your therapist.

01:12:08.604 --> 01:12:10.976
There's no love involved.
Mentally ill.

01:12:10.976 --> 01:12:12.109
Don't call me like that.

01:12:12.134 --> 01:12:14.226
I call you mentally ill
because this is mentally ill.

01:12:14.226 --> 01:12:15.226
That's what you are.

01:12:15.251 --> 01:12:17.435
And you're leaving my house.
I'm not going to argue with you.

01:12:17.435 --> 01:12:21.524
And get ready to return every penny
you stole from me by copying knowledge.

01:12:53.159 --> 01:12:58.313
Whatever, whatever
dude, go with the flow.

01:13:02.738 --> 01:13:07.455
Fati, go with the flow, please
flow. There's nothing wrong.

01:13:14.134 --> 01:13:17.999
I love it, i love it.

01:13:20.710 --> 01:13:21.780
Whatever.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.211
Fati, whatever, dont worry.

01:13:29.236 --> 01:13:30.670
Let it go.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.890
Go with the flow.

01:13:32.178 --> 01:13:34.168
Trust.
Let go!

01:13:49.049 --> 01:13:50.515
You are not
going to belive this.

01:13:50.632 --> 01:13:52.326
I have some bad news for you.

01:13:52.351 --> 01:13:53.393
What happened?

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.176
Joaquin Ferreira, the
director of the refugees.

01:13:56.201 --> 01:13:57.701
Do you remember that
movie from the 90s?

01:13:57.732 --> 01:13:59.476
-Super famous?
-Of course.

01:13:59.476 --> 01:14:01.268
Well, this morning
he had a heart attack.

01:14:01.351 --> 01:14:02.351
Don't tell me.

01:14:02.376 --> 01:14:03.684
No, no, no, don't worry.

01:14:03.785 --> 01:14:06.340
Fortunately, he's okay
and he's in the hospital.

01:14:26.326 --> 01:14:27.326
He's very fragile.

01:14:28.268 --> 01:14:29.957
I'm going to ask you, please.

01:14:30.393 --> 01:14:31.972
Don't disturb him any more.

01:14:33.227 --> 01:14:34.740
Leave me alone with him.

01:14:40.334 --> 01:14:41.372
Dad.

01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:46.549
I need to ask you something.

01:14:48.935 --> 01:14:50.501
I beg you.
Please.

01:14:52.276 --> 01:14:54.255
My mom committed suicide?

01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:57.340
Why are you asking me that?

01:14:58.075 --> 01:15:07.143
It's just that I went to theraphy and I'm
recovering memories when you abused mom.

01:15:07.752 --> 01:15:09.383
Who did you see?

01:15:09.951 --> 01:15:12.658
All my life he treated
me like a child.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.791
Why don't you tell me the truth?

01:15:14.826 --> 01:15:17.374
Why did you drugged
me with the pill?

01:15:17.409 --> 01:15:19.133
Because you need them.

01:15:20.425 --> 01:15:22.807
My mom commited
suicide, yes or no?

01:15:24.143 --> 01:15:25.143
No.

01:15:27.693 --> 01:15:28.720
So.

01:15:33.093 --> 01:15:34.508
You killed her?

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:37.106
No i didn't.

01:15:38.303 --> 01:15:39.587
Who killed her?

01:15:40.218 --> 01:15:43.141
I know you don't like it, Fátima,
but it's for your own good.

01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:45.512
Yes, Yes.
It's all for my own good.

01:15:45.659 --> 01:15:47.368
You think I'm enjoying it.

01:15:47.393 --> 01:15:48.783
But I don't like it, Mom.

01:15:48.808 --> 01:15:50.301
don't let them give
me electro shocks.

01:15:50.326 --> 01:15:52.083
It's therapy, Fátima.

01:15:52.185 --> 01:15:53.512
It's for you to be cured.

01:15:53.537 --> 01:15:56.672
Can't you hear me and
understand that I don't like it?

01:15:56.697 --> 01:15:57.939
I don't like it.

01:15:57.964 --> 01:15:59.910
Don't talk to me
like that, young lady.

01:15:59.935 --> 01:16:01.622
You don't know
everything we do for you.

01:16:01.681 --> 01:16:03.951
You don't know how much
we've sacrificed for you.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.167
-Shut up!
-You are ungrateful!

01:16:06.192 --> 01:16:07.728
Shut up!
I hate you!

01:16:07.753 --> 01:16:09.416
You, shut up, stupid!

01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:10.799
Shut up now!

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:50.100
If I had a time machine,

01:17:50.387 --> 01:17:57.249
I would travel to the past to give Fatima's
dad 200 condoms to save humanity.

01:19:14.335 --> 01:19:18.624
Hey, whats going on dudes, tomorrow is the
final battle of rap against Nacho Cobos.

01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:23.260
It'll take place at the Monument to
the Revolution at 18:00 in the afternoon.

01:19:23.285 --> 01:19:24.668
See you there dawngs!

01:20:52.734 --> 01:20:55.317
I'm bringing you an
order of 200 condoms.

01:21:00.601 --> 01:21:02.539
You wanted to hit me.
Right?

01:21:05.593 --> 01:21:06.733
You are the nut job.

01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:28.610
Hey, Fati.

01:21:30.276 --> 01:21:33.895
I know it's hard, but you can
tell me what happened that night?

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.503
What do you want to know?

01:21:39.934 --> 01:21:40.934
Everything.

01:21:41.226 --> 01:21:42.310
How did it happen?

01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:47.475
Cami, It's just that it's really painful
for me. I'd rather not remember it.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.066
But, Fati, I just
can't believe it.

01:21:49.506 --> 01:21:51.351
Neither do I.
It was awful.

01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:53.603
I can't believe
Juan stabbed Sofi.

01:21:54.235 --> 01:21:58.851
And it almost killed me. You would have
seen it too, he went crazy beating Sofia.

01:21:58.876 --> 01:22:01.056
But Juan wouldn't do that.

01:22:01.851 --> 01:22:03.724
Of course, if he
was super violent.

01:22:03.943 --> 01:22:05.316
What are you insinuating?

01:22:06.309 --> 01:22:08.185
Fati, I think there's
something you're not telling me.

01:22:08.359 --> 01:22:09.703
No, I already told
you everything.

01:22:09.728 --> 01:22:12.333
And if you don't believe me, I don't
know what you're doing here, really.

01:22:31.901 --> 01:22:33.176
Hello, how are you?

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:36.972
How are you?

01:22:40.417 --> 01:22:46.831
I am happy to be here with all of
you. You have an amazing vibe.

01:22:51.113 --> 01:22:54.762
I swear to you I feel
beautiful things in my heart.

01:22:54.787 --> 01:23:00.439
And as you know I've been going thrugh very difficult times,
but with your love you've given me strenght to keep going.

01:23:00.464 --> 01:23:04.435
And now I feel in
my heart infinite love.

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:11.566
She's talking bullshit.

01:23:12.685 --> 01:23:13.897
She's an influencer.

01:23:14.476 --> 01:23:15.699
What did you expect?

01:23:16.249 --> 01:23:17.476
Fati!

01:23:17.476 --> 01:23:18.599
Fati!

01:23:20.358 --> 01:23:21.358
Fati!

01:23:21.383 --> 01:23:22.424
Fati!

01:23:38.601 --> 01:23:39.601
Diana?

01:23:39.752 --> 01:23:40.752
Yes.

01:23:40.953 --> 01:23:42.100
_ Bitchota?

01:23:42.132 --> 01:23:43.145
What?

01:23:55.509 --> 01:23:56.509
Fati!

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.049
Don't touch her face.
No, no, no.

01:24:16.387 --> 01:24:17.720
Don't you remember me?

01:24:19.218 --> 01:24:20.218
No.

01:24:22.562 --> 01:24:24.143
I'm what you're missing out.

01:24:25.718 --> 01:24:26.726
What?

01:24:26.751 --> 01:24:27.751
Look.

01:25:34.226 --> 01:25:36.001
What are you doing
here, fucking nuts?

01:25:44.943 --> 01:25:45.943
What do you want?

01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:47.851
What are you doing in my house?

01:25:49.084 --> 01:25:50.159
Don't move.

01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:55.247
What was in the pills?

01:26:00.358 --> 01:26:04.190
My pills, the ones you
had them analyzed.

01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:08.310
I don't know.

01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:12.425
I canceled it. You stopped
coming and canceled the result.

01:26:15.819 --> 01:26:17.726
Don't come closer.
Don't come closer.

01:26:26.626 --> 01:26:29.033
Take it easy, Jackie.

01:26:30.806 --> 01:26:32.143
Take it easy.

01:26:44.912 --> 01:26:50.758
I know that you like to be the center
of attention and that you're jealous.

01:26:54.993 --> 01:26:58.071
But I just came to tell you
that I love you so much.

01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:07.673
And that I thank you for waking me
up because there is no turning back.

01:27:08.394 --> 01:27:09.394
Right?

01:27:17.759 --> 01:27:18.858
Are you going to hurt me?

01:27:35.035 --> 01:27:39.279
I love you so much, Jackie Come.

01:27:47.176 --> 01:27:49.094
I love you, Jackie

01:27:57.787 --> 01:28:01.204
So, you're telling me to fire the
costumer relationship manager?

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.519
Well, at least you
must talk to him.

01:28:03.710 --> 01:28:05.337
No, you talk to him.

01:28:06.083 --> 01:28:07.391
Oh, another problem.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.810
Paco, listen.

01:28:11.835 --> 01:28:13.724
I am arriving at Fátima's house.

01:28:14.243 --> 01:28:16.306
I know something
weird is going on there.

01:28:16.768 --> 01:28:19.351
Look if I don't write to you in half
an hour, please come and get me.

01:28:19.351 --> 01:28:20.351
Ok?

01:28:23.135 --> 01:28:26.581
Oh God! Set a timer
of 30 minutes, please.

01:28:28.618 --> 01:28:29.618
What should i do?

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:36.226
How are you?
Did you rest?

01:28:38.359 --> 01:28:39.401
Hello.

01:28:40.801 --> 01:28:42.128
Ready to rehearse?

01:28:44.378 --> 01:28:45.518
No.

01:28:50.677 --> 01:28:51.814
What did you say?

01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:55.001
I'm not going to sing.

01:28:55.968 --> 01:28:59.858
Look, Machete, you
know the rules, right?

01:29:00.249 --> 01:29:02.258
We have a project together.

01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:05.818
If you sing pretty,
I'll let you live.

01:29:06.342 --> 01:29:08.533
If you don't sing, you'll die.

01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:10.853
I don't give a fuck,
I'm tired of you.

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:12.726
-Just say yes, idiot.
-Shut up.

01:29:12.751 --> 01:29:13.851
Shut up now.

01:29:14.735 --> 01:29:16.195
They're already helping me.

01:29:16.643 --> 01:29:19.603
It was near, one block away.
But now I'm calmed.

01:29:19.949 --> 01:29:21.128
That's all, it's all set..

01:29:24.602 --> 01:29:26.216
Stop it, leave
him alone, please.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:27.691
Are you going to sing?

01:29:28.793 --> 01:29:29.876
Say yes.

01:29:30.676 --> 01:29:31.725
I'm not,

01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:34.576
go fuck yourself.

01:29:38.566 --> 01:29:39.770
Please, stop.

01:29:41.217 --> 01:29:45.406
Leave him Fátima, that's enough.

01:30:12.593 --> 01:30:14.112
He no longer has a pulse

01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:22.083
Have you seen what you make me do?

01:30:29.001 --> 01:30:30.623
This is not a game,

01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:35.473
you have to participate.

01:30:36.425 --> 01:30:39.785
If you sing beautiful
tomorrow, you'll be at home.

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.654
Fátima, please, please.

01:30:41.679 --> 01:30:42.996
Let me go.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:46.619
I swear I'm going to behave well,
I will never insult anyone again.

01:30:46.644 --> 01:30:49.149
Please, I'm begging you.

01:30:49.174 --> 01:30:51.825
Just sing beautiful
and I'll let you go.

01:30:55.927 --> 01:30:58.410
Felix Ferro.
You do the second voices.

01:31:02.029 --> 01:31:03.496
Let's start from the top.

01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:06.144
Three.
Four.

01:31:09.943 --> 01:31:12.171
Are you going to make
an effort, yes or no?

01:31:38.477 --> 01:31:40.927
Oh my god.
What the fuck.

01:31:42.243 --> 01:31:43.571
Here, here.

01:31:45.976 --> 01:31:47.092
Help!

01:31:47.975 --> 01:31:49.858
Help me, help me.
Please.

01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:53.725
That's it.

01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:56.619
No, no no, Fuck!

01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:02.754
You can't keep
kindnaping people.

01:32:03.279 --> 01:32:04.435
Stop it.

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:05.794
Why are you doing this?

01:32:21.942 --> 01:32:23.625
Cami is my best friend.

01:32:32.006 --> 01:32:33.331
The number you dialed.

01:32:33.417 --> 01:32:34.529
Oh, fuck!

01:32:35.635 --> 01:32:40.373
I'll be right back, I'm going to look after
my teenagers, it turns out I'm a nanny.

01:32:47.725 --> 01:32:51.298
Now we present our
anti-bullying festival.

01:32:58.185 --> 01:32:59.627
I am very happy,

01:33:02.127 --> 01:33:03.677
thanks to Fati.

01:33:05.976 --> 01:33:08.817
I found a tender being
inside me that I didn't know.

01:33:13.176 --> 01:33:15.681
We are convinced that
as a society

01:33:16.464 --> 01:33:21.297
we must learn to respect the
different ways of being and think.

01:33:24.201 --> 01:33:25.653
Bullying is bad.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:28.439
Making fun is ugly,.

01:33:29.718 --> 01:33:30.718
Very ugly.

01:33:31.775 --> 01:33:35.280
With this song we want to
invite all

01:33:35.489 --> 01:33:42.866
those who feel attacked to don't let anyone
hurt you and to fight for your essence.

01:33:44.272 --> 01:33:45.318
End.

01:33:59.185 --> 01:34:00.774
Fucking nuts.

01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:03.417
Make some effort, damn it.

01:34:03.442 --> 01:34:04.442
Fuck!

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:09.226
Felix.

01:34:09.892 --> 01:34:12.451
There are people like winds,
who want to knock me down.

01:34:17.625 --> 01:34:19.026
Sing higher.

01:34:19.243 --> 01:34:22.034
And don't want to shut up.

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:24.608
And it seems by moments.

01:34:24.633 --> 01:34:25.920
Tune up, fucking shit.

01:34:25.945 --> 01:34:28.353
That I'm not going to make it.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:34.568
But I search until I find
another way to get there.

01:34:34.652 --> 01:34:35.860
I'm going to kill you.

01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:41.160
I don't think at any
moment about giving up.

01:34:42.185 --> 01:34:43.260
Never.

01:34:44.542 --> 01:34:48.942
It's a serious mistake
wanting to hurt myself.

01:34:52.927 --> 01:34:57.550
I'll forgive your hate and
spread my wings,

01:34:59.868 --> 01:35:04.128
I will recover the strength that
you took away from me.

01:35:05.462 --> 01:35:09.693
And I'll be the storm
you didn't expect.

01:35:10.312 --> 01:35:12.995
When you have lost everything,

01:35:16.422 --> 01:35:21.176
they can't take
anything from you.

01:35:33.519 --> 01:35:39.433
I'm going to do what's
necessary not to give up.

01:35:39.808 --> 01:35:42.487
When something comes across me.

01:35:42.726 --> 01:35:45.162
I'll do what needs to be done.

01:35:47.828 --> 01:35:52.099
And I don't ever
think about giving up.

01:35:53.293 --> 01:35:54.872
Never.

01:35:55.645 --> 01:36:00.245
It's a serious mistake
wanting to hurt myself.

01:36:04.797 --> 01:36:08.781
And I'll be the storm
you didn't expect.

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:24.153
When you have lost everything,
they can't take anything from you.

01:36:34.693 --> 01:36:36.222
You did it horrible.

01:36:37.277 --> 01:36:39.937
You didn't sing how I told you.

01:36:47.609 --> 01:36:48.939
You failed me.

01:36:48.964 --> 01:36:50.225
I'm singing no, please, no.

01:36:50.250 --> 01:36:51.587
I'm singing.

01:37:17.151 --> 01:37:19.018
I don't want to die.

01:37:22.143 --> 01:37:24.248
Please, save me,
get me out of here.

01:37:28.594 --> 01:37:30.365
Please don't kill me.

01:37:31.979 --> 01:37:33.768
Fátima, let me go.

01:37:37.726 --> 01:37:38.815
Let me go.

01:37:42.435 --> 01:37:44.208
Please help me.

01:37:48.659 --> 01:37:49.659
Help me.

01:38:00.418 --> 01:38:02.690
Please. Please. I promise.

01:38:02.715 --> 01:38:05.415
Forgive me, I swear
I'm not gonna do it again.

01:38:14.268 --> 01:38:15.928
You are sick.

01:38:33.685 --> 01:38:34.685
Camilla.

01:38:41.384 --> 01:38:42.482
Camilla.

01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:44.884
Where are the others?

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:02.893
Come on, quickly!
Let's go, let's go!

01:39:03.651 --> 01:39:05.043
Move!
Move!

01:39:05.068 --> 01:39:06.318
Give me the hose.

01:40:14.251 --> 01:40:15.518
Rest in peace.

01:40:15.685 --> 01:40:16.857
Fátima Ferreira.

01:40:17.393 --> 01:40:21.081
The influencer Fati Ferry
kidnapped her so-called haters,

01:40:21.426 --> 01:40:24.653
took them to her basement and
forced them to sing love songs.

01:40:24.817 --> 01:40:27.482
The incompetent investigation by
the Judicial Police,

01:40:27.653 --> 01:40:30.250
since it was unable to
contemplate Fátima

01:40:30.275 --> 01:40:33.782
as Sofia's real murderer
of Sofia Forjales Ortiz.

01:40:33.807 --> 01:40:36.473
A lady influencer kidnapped...

01:40:39.861 --> 01:40:41.390
In a unexpected way

01:40:41.414 --> 01:40:45.902
Fátima has become the voice of allthose who
have received hate on the social networks.

01:40:45.927 --> 01:40:48.680
That's right, if all this
mockery, all this pain,

01:40:48.704 --> 01:40:50.769
all this anguish that Fati
received,

01:40:50.793 --> 01:40:54.004
transformed him and converted him
in a very, very special way.

01:40:54.034 --> 01:40:56.141
Where congressmen are
deliberating

01:40:56.165 --> 01:40:59.492
whether cyberbullying should be
considered a serious crime in the country.

01:40:59.517 --> 01:41:05.997
I'm the fatilover number one my dear family
here in New York everyone loves Fati.

01:41:06.022 --> 01:41:08.403
I don't agree. It's not
fair what they did to her.

01:41:08.428 --> 01:41:13.076
The media, her dad, all of them are
the sick ones. They are the sick ones.

01:41:13.235 --> 01:41:14.680
They are the sick ones.

01:41:14.705 --> 01:41:16.030
Fati was good person.

01:41:16.076 --> 01:41:18.580
Fati changed my life.
Go, go, go.

01:41:20.326 --> 01:41:22.284
Felix can you give
a statement, please?

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:25.671
Now, what do you want? I already told
them everything they needed to know.

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:28.285
What else do you want to know?
She was fucking nuts, that's all.

01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:30.115
Anything else it's just gossip.

01:41:32.551 --> 01:41:35.265
We had to defecate in buckets.
And she.

01:41:35.976 --> 01:41:37.644
She cleaned us up and.

01:41:39.176 --> 01:41:41.321
I still can't understand
what I experience.

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:45.808
Mr. Ferreira, can you
give us a statement?

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:49.698
My heart is broken by
the death of my daugther,.

01:41:50.965 --> 01:41:57.388
In my mourning I reflected that if God
gave this second chance,

01:41:58.346 --> 01:42:02.724
it's because I have the
last responsibility to bring

01:42:03.202 --> 01:42:06.621
my daughter's story
to the big screen.

01:42:08.009 --> 01:42:09.930
So people can get to know her.

01:42:11.393 --> 01:42:13.608
And give her back her dignity.

01:42:15.443 --> 01:42:18.951
Friends, I've received more
information about this case.

01:42:18.976 --> 01:42:21.135
And its about the
most popular victim.

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.883
I'm talking about Cami.

01:42:23.002 --> 01:42:25.647
Yes, Sofi Fojo's close friend,

01:42:25.671 --> 01:42:28.125
and the latest victim of the
Abduction of Fati Ferri.

01:42:44.150 --> 01:42:48.610
I am so grateful for all the love
and support I have received.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.183
And yes.

01:42:50.208 --> 01:42:54.814
It has been a hard time but I have
grown as a person

01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:59.611
and my only task is to return all
the love I have received from my fans.

01:43:07.092 --> 01:43:08.738
Lets go, we're
running late, my love.

01:43:48.955 --> 01:43:50.488
We are here, to see miss.

01:43:53.619 --> 01:43:55.355
Good morning, Miss Jacky.

01:43:55.599 --> 01:43:57.268
Hello, Matias.

01:43:57.393 --> 01:43:59.238
How is my favorite student?

01:43:59.476 --> 01:44:00.872
Sorry we're late.

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:02.913
Oh, don't worry, dear.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.409
-You're on time.
-Okay, thank you.

01:44:05.563 --> 01:44:07.336
Goodbye, my love.
Bye.

01:44:12.927 --> 01:44:14.401
You are sick.

01:44:37.176 --> 01:44:38.185
My love.

01:44:40.343 --> 01:44:41.559
Forgive me, please.

01:44:44.574 --> 01:44:46.580
For wanting to have
a normal daughter.

01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:50.134
I missed out an
extraordinary daughter.

01:45:34.568 --> 01:45:37.295
We are going to ask you again
to put your case under the seat.

01:45:54.693 --> 01:45:55.610
Welcome.

01:45:55.635 --> 01:45:56.635
Thank you.

01:45:58.866 --> 01:46:01.155
Matías finally arrived.

01:46:01.285 --> 01:46:02.930
We're all here, guys.

01:46:03.043 --> 01:46:05.674
Let's go with our
morning affirmations.

01:46:05.851 --> 01:46:07.701
One, two, three.

01:46:08.001 --> 01:46:10.282
I deserve endless love.

01:46:15.084 --> 01:46:16.868
Well done!
