No.

Oh.

31:48.283 --> 31:49.868
Well, I stand corrected.

31:49.868 --> 31:52.120
Well, not exactly.
Kerry couldn't file a claim

31:52.120 --> 31:54.622
because the policy
was canceled three months ago.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.624
Apparently,
the insurance company

31:56.624 --> 31:58.501
wanted a new appraisal
on the necklace

31:58.501 --> 32:00.587
before they'd agree
to renew the policy.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.921
But Kerry never brought it in.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.424
She let the policy lapse?
That's odd.

32:04.424 --> 32:06.051
Well, unless there was
a reason

32:06.051 --> 32:08.470
why she didn't want it
to be inspected.

32:08.470 --> 32:09.929
Because she knew
it was fake.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.640
Okay, but she definitely
had to have had

32:12.640 --> 32:15.268
the original necklace
at some point, right?

32:15.268 --> 32:18.021
I mean, it was insured
in the first place.

32:18.021 --> 32:20.523
Yes, so sometime between
getting the initial policy

32:20.523 --> 32:22.108

policy lapsing,

32:22.108 --> 32:24.819

was replaced with a replica.

this new information,

Okay, if you're right,
how would we ever prove that?

32:44.798 --> 32:45.965

to somebody

32:45.965 --> 32:47.634
