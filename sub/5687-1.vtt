01:09.314 --> 01:11.512
Thank you, Detective

01:19.732 --> 01:21.731
Any change?
Nothing since you left.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.751
She seems to be looking for something.

01:32.137 --> 01:32.417
Camera?

01:59.564 --> 02:00.981
She has a nice ass.

02:02.918 --> 02:04.811
Stay focused on the mission.

02:11.793 --> 02:14.575
Keep an eye on her, but don't get too close.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.377
- Good morning
- Good morning

02:27.732 --> 02:28.528
What can I get for you?

02:28.965 --> 02:30.417
Tea with milk and fresh orange juice-

02:30.779 --> 02:32.998
-and a croissant with butter, I've already attended to it.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.291
- Thank you
- No problem.

02:41.499 --> 02:45.263
- Do you have a visual?
- I've got visual, she's drinking her tea.

02:46.448 --> 02:46.917
- Say again?
- She's drinking her tea!

02:49.043 --> 02:52.136
- Can I get you a tea, sir?
- No, no thank you.

03:06.456 --> 03:08.228
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning

03:08.489 --> 03:11.052
- I'm looking for Elise Ward
- Ward, the lady (pointing)

03:12.582 --> 03:12.928
Okay, thanks

03:15.959 --> 03:18.628
- Good morning, Elise Ward?
- Yes, that's me.

03:19.010 --> 03:20.142
I have a letter for you

03:20.429 --> 03:21.415
She's talking to someone

03:21.706 --> 03:22.956
A delivery boy

03:29.831 --> 03:31.040
Scotland Yard, London

03:32.975 --> 03:34.010
Yes?

03:34.628 --> 03:39.332
She's at the usual cafe, she's speaking with a man,
it looks like a messenger...

03:39.643 --> 03:42.206
But you said to call if anything changed in her routine

03:46.791 --> 03:49.224
Stay on his face.  His face!

03:54.723 --> 03:59.074
- Do you think it's Alexander Pierce?
- I think everybody's Pierce.

04:00.553 --> 04:02.490
No, it's okay.
It is a gift, you can keep it.

04:03.240 --> 04:03.887
Thank you

04:19.075 --> 04:19.622
- Here you go, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

04:18.983 --> 04:19.625
Get him.

04:20.005 --> 04:20.579
Alright, grab him.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.529
Let's move.

04:25.128 --> 04:27.570
Sir, sir! Sir, we are police.

04:29.349 --> 04:31.920
- What did I do?
- You're under arrest

04:32.485 --> 04:35.570
- You're coming with us.
- What did I do? - Shh!

04:36.767 --> 04:38.078
What are you arresting me for?

04:50.594 --> 04:54.359
"Elise, you have no reason to trust me any more..."

04:54.873 --> 04:56.455
"But give me a chance to explain myself"

04:56.693 --> 05:00.003
"I know the police are watching you, we have to throw them off the trail"

05:01.068 --> 05:03.602
"Board the 8:22 at the Gare De Lyon"

05:04.474 --> 05:07.610
"Pick someone my height and build, and make them believe it is me"

05:15.079 --> 05:16.405
"Burn this letter."

05:17.045 --> 05:22.921
"It is important you follow my instructions precisely.
I love you, Alexander"

05:27.000 --> 05:28.220
It's from him.

05:43.629 --> 05:46.142
Save that letter, go in now.
Save that letter!

05:46.349 --> 05:47.421
Go, now!

05:57.816 --> 06:00.295
- No, stop! Police!
- What happened?

06:02.269 --> 06:03.582
Well?

06:04.984 --> 06:07.222
The letter is burned to shit.

06:08.484 --> 06:10.170
Don't fucking touch it.

06:10.848 --> 06:14.282
Collect the ashes, take them to the van.
I'll send you someone.

06:37.607 --> 06:40.113
The road's too narrow, we have to go around.  Quick!

06:50.385 --> 06:54.778
Turn right!
Quick, go!

07:21.733 --> 07:22.529
Let's go

07:32.318 --> 07:37.238
Police, make way!

07:44.544 --> 07:45.691
Damn!

07:55.054 --> 07:56.738
Scotland Yard

08:01.709 --> 08:02.881
Wednesday meeting.

08:11.519 --> 08:15.536
So, Alexander Pierce has a new face
Just as you suspected

08:17.176 --> 08:21.178
I'd have thought it must've taken quite a lot of the
money he stole from Reginald Shaw

08:21.742 --> 08:24.646
To finance this transformation

08:25.740 --> 08:29.988
Ahmed Toubali, bicycle courier of Algerian descent

08:30.769 --> 08:34.557
Not only has Pierce acquired a wife, and a child...

08:35.364 --> 08:39.210
He is also 4 inches shorter than the used to be.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.691
That must have been a big item of expenditure?

08:44.331 --> 08:47.893
Congratulations Acheson,
You have indeed cracked this case.

08:53.095 --> 08:57.283
Sir, this morning she recieved a note...
and we have strong reason to believe -

08:57.503 --> 09:02.618
Alexander Pierce has 744 million in illegal assets

09:02.906 --> 09:05.756
That given he is a British Subject, we might seize.

09:06.055 --> 09:11.032
This operation so far has cost me
eight million pounds.

09:11.032 --> 09:14.991
If I thought there were more than a one in a hundred
chance you could be successful...

09:15.281 --> 09:18.330
It would be rational for me to continue this operation...

09:20.493 --> 09:21.803
I do not.

09:26.318 --> 09:29.001
... that's an amendment... yes...

09:36.635 --> 09:37.762
Thank you, sir

10:39.186 --> 10:40.449
8:22

10:42.387 --> 10:45.416
- Sir, the projection for the faces you asked for
- Not now

10:47.917 --> 10:50.385
"8:22 Lyon"

10:51.765 --> 10:54.750
Are they meeting in Lyon at eight twenty-two?

10:55.002 --> 10:57.750
- Gare de Lyon, perhaps?
- Gare de Lyon...

11:03.854 --> 11:07.603
That's it, Gare De Lyon!
The train station, she's getting on a 8:22 train.

11:07.932 --> 11:08.635
Go!

11:15.673 --> 11:18.318
"Board the 8:22 at the Gare De Lyon"

11:33.501 --> 11:36.454
"Pick someone my height and build, and make them believe it is me"

12:44.801 --> 12:47.210
- I'm sorry
- What for?

13:01.113 --> 13:04.238
Do you mind me smoking?
It's not a real cigarette.

13:04.238 --> 13:06.222
- What?
- It's electronic

13:06.222 --> 13:11.285
It delivers the same amount of nicotine, but the smoke is water vapor.
Yeah, watch! (puffs)

13:12.644 --> 13:13.854
LED light

13:15.896 --> 13:17.816
That's somewhat disappointing.

13:19.864 --> 13:21.534
Would you rather have me smoking for real?

13:21.534 --> 13:24.459
No, I would rather you be a man who did exactly as he pleased.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.752
- I'm Elise
- I'm Frank

13:29.752 --> 13:33.486
- That's a terrible name
- (laughs) Yeah, that's the only one I've got.

13:35.018 --> 13:37.583
- Maybe we can find you another...
- Okay

13:42.536 --> 13:49.024
- You're British  - Mmm
- I'm American  - Hmm

13:52.113 --> 13:53.798
What brings you to Venice?

13:54.822 --> 13:58.287
You read spy novels.
I am a mysterious woman on a train..

13:58.960 --> 14:01.455
You tell me what my story is.

14:02.958 --> 14:03.861
Okay...

14:07.459 --> 14:11.550
I think you would be a diplomat attaché.

14:11.800 --> 14:16.757
Or maybe a girl from East Germany
whose father's been kidnapped

14:17.876 --> 14:21.237
And they're blackmailing you into stealing something for them...

14:21.237 --> 14:23.958
Probably microfilm, there's usually microfilm involved.

14:23.958 --> 14:26.549
- What awaits me?
- Trouble, certainly

14:26.549 --> 14:28.414
- Danger?
- Oh, yeah.

14:28.414 --> 14:31.112
You'll most likely be shot at in less than two chapters!

14:34.695 --> 14:36.322
Is there a man in my life?

14:39.757 --> 14:40.989
... have to wait and see.

14:43.146 --> 14:44.896
- Invite me to dinner Frank
- What?

14:48.643 --> 14:53.425
- Would you like to have the dinner?
- Women don't like questions

14:56.948 --> 14:59.236
- Join me for dinner
- Too demanding

15:00.987 --> 15:03.739
- Join me for dinner?
- Another question

15:08.084 --> 15:12.738
I'm having dinner...
If you'd care to join me

15:31.519 --> 15:32.675
Musician?

15:36.532 --> 15:37.704
Bartender?

15:43.236 --> 15:44.017
I give up.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.210
Math, I teach maths.

15:49.645 --> 15:52.361
I would not have guessed that.

15:52.829 --> 15:55.209
I'd imagine you're a cool math teacher, though?

15:55.673 --> 15:57.383
Still a math teacher.

16:10.799 --> 16:15.422
- Can I take your picture?
- Sure

16:35.924 --> 16:39.142
Urgent Message From:
Unit 17 To: John Acheson

16:58.487 --> 17:01.361
- Could this be Pierce?
- We're still working on that

17:05.111 --> 17:08.320
Well, I only have the sketches to go by, so...

17:10.021 --> 17:13.673
Ectomorpheus, same basic phenotype

17:15.550 --> 17:18.205
- Bottom line, could be him
- I knew we couldn't leave her

17:18.736 --> 17:22.269
Run a worldwide blind check on that face,
Bet you ten quid there's no match

17:22.858 --> 17:25.675
Okay, but what case number do you want to book it under?

17:27.549 --> 17:30.539
- Just run it
- Do you really think it's Pierce?

17:31.206 --> 17:32.196
Run it.

17:40.970 --> 17:42.820
Get me Italian Interpol.

17:54.769 --> 18:00.630
I have a strange feeling that those two people
over there are watching us

18:08.820 --> 18:12.485
Do you know something?
I think you're right

18:13.517 --> 18:14.644
Really?

18:20.079 --> 18:22.033
You're paranoid, math teacher

18:32.423 --> 18:33.391
Memorize this face

18:34.459 --> 18:37.748
The train arrives in 10 minutes
Stop him when he descends.

18:55.831 --> 18:59.548
So, what are you doing all alone in the city of lovers?

19:00.986 --> 19:02.456
Is there no one in your life?

19:04.923 --> 19:08.909
- There was.
- What happened?

19:14.643 --> 19:18.582
- She left me.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Frank

19:32.336 --> 19:37.308
"Arrival at train station Venicia Santa Lucia in 10 minutes.
End of the line"

19:38.369 --> 19:40.850
Guess I should go get my suitcase and stuff.

19:44.574 --> 19:50.024
- Goodbye
- Goodbye, thank you.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.601
Oh shit.

20:38.194 --> 20:39.726
- Sir
- Wait

20:42.282 --> 20:43.844
"Pick someone my height and build"

20:46.913 --> 20:48.945
"And make them believe it's me"

20:51.976 --> 20:54.039
We did get an exact match

20:54.381 --> 20:57.100
He's a math teacher at Madson Community College

20:57.100 --> 20:58.836
Frank Tupelo

20:59.573 --> 21:01.809
Lost his wife in a car crash three years ago

21:02.146 --> 21:03.384
He's a tourist

21:06.507 --> 21:07.444
Thank you

21:20.095 --> 21:21.466
Get me Italian Interpol

21:36.387 --> 21:38.040
Yes?

21:40.446 --> 21:41.248
Received

21:47.074 --> 21:49.913
Abort.  We go back to HQ quickly.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.446
On the other side.

22:36.413 --> 22:39.935
- What are you doing?
- The Internet Fraud Report

22:43.570 --> 22:46.787
So, this is what Alexander Pierce looks like?

22:47.372 --> 22:49.756
It's above your clearance.
Get back to your work.

23:21.382 --> 23:24.661
He's fluttering his eyelids like a girl, that's his tell.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.536
Go all in.

23:30.037 --> 23:30.774
Damn.

23:36.036 --> 23:36.976
Yes?

23:37.819 --> 23:39.905
I have a piece of information for Mr. Shaw

23:42.194 --> 23:44.163
It's concerning Alexander Pierce

23:47.599 --> 23:49.995
Alexander Pierce has just arrived in Venice

23:50.661 --> 23:51.755
With her.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.473
- Aleri.
- Sir

24:00.808 --> 24:04.536
- Change of course, Venice
- Yes, sir

24:05.807 --> 24:08.307
Now what do I own in Venice?

24:33.383 --> 24:33.895
Hi

24:35.195 --> 24:37.975
- Do you want to come with me?
- What?

24:41.197 --> 24:43.536
Oh yeah, sure, I mean, I-I could use a lift, yeah.

24:44.537 --> 24:46.193
Thank you very - that's very kind.

25:22.426 --> 25:23.975
Welcome to Venice, Madam

25:25.567 --> 25:26.631
Bags.

25:29.100 --> 25:29.808
Thank you

25:32.903 --> 25:34.413
Oh, uh, my bags!

25:36.160 --> 25:37.246
Are you coming?

25:43.633 --> 25:44.425
Thank you (speaking spanish)

25:50.662 --> 25:52.651
Hello, Welcome to Hotel Danieri, Madam

25:52.947 --> 25:55.036
Elise Clifton-Ward, and husband

25:58.020 --> 25:59.974
We have arranged for you a wonderful suite...

26:02.966 --> 26:04.347
with bathroom and with...

26:06.996 --> 26:09.222
- May I have your documents, please?
- Yes

26:09.786 --> 26:10.596
Thank you

26:12.441 --> 26:16.363
It will be my pleasure to show you up personally.
Please, this way.

26:16.462 --> 26:16.863
Thank you

26:18.454 --> 26:22.270
- Enjoy your stay, sir
- Thank you

26:33.498 --> 26:36.339
Everything was arranged
according to the precise instructions.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.251
I very much hope you will not be disappointed.

26:39.251 --> 26:41.372
We are entering the Doches Suite

26:42.090 --> 26:48.028
A room that has been a home away from home for
Marcel Proust and Honoré de Balzac

26:52.394 --> 26:54.330
- Have a nice day, sir
- Thank you

27:02.067 --> 27:03.000
Make yourself at home

27:43.297 --> 27:45.873
This really is a very nice hotel, isn't it?

27:47.298 --> 27:49.204
They think of everything, don't they?

28:53.561 --> 28:54.856
I know he will be with her.

28:55.545 --> 28:59.547
They'll be staying at one of the grand hotels.
The Pretty, The Regina, The Danieli.

29:00.328 --> 29:02.391
I want you to keep a watch on all of them.

29:03.482 --> 29:05.497
You can kill the girl, but you can't kill him.

29:07.642 --> 29:09.753
Not until I have my money, that is.

29:10.797 --> 29:13.827
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir - Let's go.

29:32.092 --> 29:35.701
- You're ravenous.
- Do you mean ravishing?

29:36.156 --> 29:37.164
...I do.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.379
- You're ravenous
- I am.

29:41.641 --> 29:42.235
Come on!

29:56.517 --> 30:02.811
- The, um, Skambian champagne risotto, please.
- Excellent choice, excellent.

30:08.796 --> 30:12.797
He didn't say that to me
Did he not like my choice?

30:14.005 --> 30:15.809
Your choice was excellent.

30:32.982 --> 30:33.851
Who is he?

30:36.630 --> 30:41.264
Hotels don't give gifts like that, do they?
Who is he?

30:43.142 --> 30:46.609
- He's someone they used to be very important to me
- Used to?

30:49.954 --> 30:51.440
Are you meeting him in Venice?

30:53.192 --> 30:54.109
I hope so.

30:56.357 --> 30:59.516
- Part of me hopes I don't
- Why?

31:01.827 --> 31:08.826
Because I don't like being told what to do.
I don't like being "summoned".

31:11.155 --> 31:14.732
But it felt even worse not
hearing from him for two years.

31:28.940 --> 31:33.045
It's the Roman god, Janus.

31:34.471 --> 31:36.093
My mother gave it to me when I was little.

31:36.847 --> 31:41.952
She wanted it to teach me that people have two sides;
a good side, a bad side...

31:42.192 --> 31:44.015
Past and future

31:44.942 --> 31:49.732
And that we must embrace both in someone we love.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.315
And I tried...

32:05.139 --> 32:06.199
What's he like?

32:09.420 --> 32:15.419
He's... different from anybody I know.

32:20.253 --> 32:21.765
Different's good.

32:24.514 --> 32:28.641
Where I come from the highest compliment...
that you can offer a person...

32:29.732 --> 32:33.108
Is to say that they're down to earth...
Grounded.

32:33.954 --> 32:36.597
I hate it.  Drives me nutso.

32:44.906 --> 32:47.203
Would you like another Americano?

32:49.450 --> 32:51.794
I don't know, would I?

32:54.828 --> 32:59.296
It really was a very nice restaurant, wasn't it?
Oh.  Very nice wine.

33:00.903 --> 33:07.730
I'm making us a nice little drink.
Which is very nice of me, isn't it?

33:10.075 --> 33:11.015
Thank you

33:11.846 --> 33:14.130
Were those flowers here when we checked in?

33:29.189 --> 33:32.168
It is an invitation to a Ball, two nights from now.

33:35.643 --> 33:36.668
You've been "summoned"

33:38.544 --> 33:39.879
It appears I have.

34:16.981 --> 34:19.277
May I pay you a compliment?

34:20.702 --> 34:22.603
Another question you need never ask.

34:25.857 --> 34:30.781
You are the least down to earth person I've ever met.

34:51.628 --> 34:55.576
It's been a long day.
I do hope the couch will be comfortable.

34:58.065 --> 34:58.857
Good night

38:18.767 --> 38:20.876
Sorry, sir. Good morning.

38:21.584 --> 38:24.159
My name is Guido, your waiter.

38:25.022 --> 38:28.490
I'm Frank.  What's this?

38:29.096 --> 38:30.455
It's your breakfast, sir.

38:32.317 --> 38:36.616
- I didn't order any.
- The lady ordered it for you, when she left

38:44.470 --> 38:45.627
When she left?

39:11.094 --> 39:12.392
Have a nice day, sir.

39:41.842 --> 39:44.755
- Hi.
- Alexander let's go see an old friend

39:48.812 --> 39:51.436
- I'm not sure he's Pierce
- The boss warned us about this

39:52.158 --> 39:52.626
Get him!

40:07.303 --> 40:09.647
- Hello, please help
- Hello, sir

40:10.049 --> 40:13.999
Hello, I'm in need of help there are two
men trying to break down the door

40:14.877 --> 40:17.034
I see, what kind of problem do you have with the door, sir?

40:17.555 --> 40:20.348
No, no, no, there are two men with guns trying to break in!

40:20.348 --> 40:22.000
Two men carrying pistols (speaking spanish)

40:22.346 --> 40:24.499
- Your spanish is excellent, sir
- Thank you

40:26.434 --> 40:27.736
- I gotta go!
- Sir?

40:31.105 --> 40:31.896
Americans...

40:48.943 --> 40:50.566
The boss wants him alive!

41:00.082 --> 41:01.019
She's returned.

41:23.427 --> 41:24.293
Get ready to intervene.

41:27.634 --> 41:31.291
- Yes
- Commander Acheson, two armed men are chasing the American from yesterday.

41:31.519 --> 41:33.832
Shots have been fired.  Request permission to intervene.

41:34.427 --> 41:36.143
Do you still have Elise?

41:37.706 --> 41:40.754
We still have a visual on Elise Ward, but the American is in imminent danger.

41:41.195 --> 41:44.786
You mean the mathematics teacher from Wisconsin?
I'd say not our mandate.

41:45.207 --> 41:47.307
Sir, this man is in real peril.

41:48.863 --> 41:51.708
This is exactly why she chose him, to distract us.

41:52.442 --> 41:53.478
Stay with her

41:53.803 --> 41:57.863
Do not move unless she moves.
Am I making myself crystal clear?

41:58.415 --> 42:00.756
Sir, they will kill him.

42:03.645 --> 42:04.914
Not our mandate.

42:56.518 --> 42:59.136
- Look at that man!
- What the hell?

43:02.832 --> 43:05.041
Center, send someone to the market!

43:05.896 --> 43:08.942
There is a nut trying to kill himself.
American, I bet.

43:10.042 --> 43:11.364
Stop, stop!

43:13.069 --> 43:14.300
Do not jump!

43:33.229 --> 43:35.515
- I'm so sorry
- Asshole!

43:36.011 --> 43:36.793
I'm sorry!

43:40.447 --> 43:42.748
- Stop him
- I'm sorry, sorry!

44:07.141 --> 44:08.763
- Answer the phone.
- Yes, sir.

44:22.421 --> 44:27.124
- I think you need it more than I.
- "Thank you" (speaking spanish)

44:27.858 --> 44:29.044
"You're welcome" (speaking spanish)

44:31.206 --> 44:32.505
Smoke?

44:36.046 --> 44:36.577
No?

44:50.476 --> 44:53.701
- Now, you wish to report a murder?
- No.

44:55.343 --> 44:57.186
Some people tried to kill me

44:58.004 --> 44:59.921
I was told you are reporting a murder.

45:00.328 --> 45:02.515
Attempted murder.

45:03.769 --> 45:08.662
- That's not so serious.
- No, not when you downgrade it from murder.

45:09.725 --> 45:12.201
But when you upgrade it from room
service, it's quite serious.

45:12.422 --> 45:16.344
- So is assaulting a Police Officer.
- That was an accident.

45:16.654 --> 45:18.108
The Officer feels differently.

45:20.936 --> 45:22.545
...With all due respect, sir

45:23.593 --> 45:26.172
...I think maybe I should be talking with someone

45:28.313 --> 45:31.457
...Someone not Italian.

45:32.628 --> 45:36.067
- Like the Embassy, or Interpol.
- Interpol? <scoffs>

45:36.358 --> 45:38.624
I'm an American citizen.

45:39.232 --> 45:41.283
- What does that mean?
- I do not know.

45:41.283 --> 45:43.892
But I was involved in something here and no offense,
this is not a local issue.

45:45.780 --> 45:47.732
What is it you think you're involved in?

45:52.169 --> 45:56.204
It all started when I met a woman
on the train from Paris

45:56.785 --> 45:59.162
- This already good!
- No, no.

45:59.403 --> 46:00.984
She took me to her hotel.

46:01.233 --> 46:02.513
- Ah, wonderful!
- No, no.

46:02.716 --> 46:05.856
...she's involved with another man, I think she's in love...

46:06.845 --> 46:09.847
- Sorry to hear that
- I know

46:11.233 --> 46:11.970
...Anyway

46:13.047 --> 46:18.247
This man, whatever his story is.
Some people are obviously trying to kill him.

46:20.451 --> 46:23.608
- How do you know this?
- Because they tried to kill me.

46:25.169 --> 46:27.358
- They tried to kill you?
- Yes!

46:27.358 --> 46:31.141
Because they must have thought that I was him.

46:36.786 --> 46:39.796
- I like you Mr. Tupelo
- I like you too, sir

46:41.780 --> 46:44.357
But surely you understand how strange this all sounds.

46:49.356 --> 46:50.232
Come with me

46:58.796 --> 46:59.704
Where are you taking me?

47:05.281 --> 47:06.953
Oh!  You're going to lock me in there?

47:14.233 --> 47:18.311
Please don't do this.
Sir, I've done nothing wrong

47:21.439 --> 47:24.015
- Please!
- It's only until I check some facts

47:29.861 --> 47:30.474
Hi.

47:43.011 --> 47:45.826
Your facts checked out.
We have to leave.

47:47.890 --> 47:51.011
- You're not safe here
- I don't understand

47:52.424 --> 47:53.936
This has to look right.

47:57.265 --> 47:58.012
Come on

48:01.453 --> 48:03.689
The man you're talking about is
called Alexander Pierce

48:04.575 --> 48:06.655
...who stole big money from a gangster.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.140
They came to Venice to find him

48:10.733 --> 48:11.951
They think you are him

48:13.315 --> 48:18.387
They placed a... how do you say... bounty on your head.

48:20.658 --> 48:21.939
That's why you're not safe.

48:30.903 --> 48:31.824
Wait here for a moment

48:56.659 --> 48:58.189
You've come to buy a key?

49:10.501 --> 49:12.345
Brand new bills, I appreciate it

49:21.712 --> 49:22.774
You think we cheat you?

49:22.774 --> 49:25.111
Of course not, I just enjoy counting

49:34.367 --> 49:38.018
Well, gentlemen, Alexander Pierce is all yours.

49:47.234 --> 49:48.058
Do not shoot him!

50:08.207 --> 50:09.050
I think we lost them!

50:11.051 --> 50:12.458
I'd really like to take these off!

50:13.503 --> 50:15.174
We have to wait until we get to open waters

53:14.027 --> 53:16.922
It suits you perfectly, sir
You have a wonderful figure.

53:18.251 --> 53:23.205
- You think it's a little loose?
- No, it's of the utmost magnificence

53:30.638 --> 53:32.394
Fourteen red, bet made.

53:35.214 --> 53:35.627
Wager, sir?

53:38.340 --> 53:38.904
Forty-two red

53:42.751 --> 53:44.813
- They're back.
- Yeah, bring them in.

53:46.113 --> 53:48.372
- I'll come back tomorrow?
- No, no, no, stay.

53:58.263 --> 53:59.688
We tried everything, sir

54:01.466 --> 54:04.199
- But he got away.
- So I heard, so I heard.

54:05.480 --> 54:09.934
They're referring to the young man who
stole $2.3 billion dollars from me.

54:13.060 --> 54:16.186
You know, I worked very hard for years so I wouldn't have to

54:16.186 --> 54:19.904
do the dirty work any more. No more chasing traitors

54:20.574 --> 54:21.873
...No more killing

54:24.113 --> 54:27.808
Now I employ people
to do those things for me

54:29.092 --> 54:31.591
Except that you don't!

55:08.198 --> 55:11.654
- Does it look alright?
- Yes!

55:12.945 --> 55:15.718
- Like always.
- What's always?

55:17.564 --> 55:18.343
Very good.

55:20.999 --> 55:23.286
Yes, I think it looks alright!

55:38.252 --> 55:39.794
Huh, so that's how you pick a lock.

55:40.483 --> 55:41.796
How do you know how to do that?

55:46.173 --> 55:49.360
Where's the owner of this boat? Bottom of a canal?

55:50.358 --> 55:52.421
Sitting at a cafe with a pocketful of Euros

55:55.858 --> 55:59.702
Why is this happening?
Why is everyone trying to kill me?

56:02.286 --> 56:03.922
Because I kissed you.

56:11.391 --> 56:13.318
Do I look that much like him?

56:17.225 --> 56:19.765
I am sorry I got you involved in all this.

56:20.391 --> 56:22.003
Why are you involved in all this?

56:24.751 --> 56:28.850
- Because I'm in love with him.
- Really? I'm not.

56:30.113 --> 56:32.576
...Seriously, help me understand why?

56:32.986 --> 56:35.390
I honestly didn't think he would let it go this far.

56:35.923 --> 56:37.623
I didn't think he would let Shaw get to you.

56:38.421 --> 56:41.920
Shaw - that's the man who Pierce stole from?

56:43.349 --> 56:47.130
Reginald Shaw. Alexander used to be his private banker.

56:49.673 --> 56:54.249
- I thought he was Russian or something like that.
- He surrounds himself with the Russians.

56:54.641 --> 56:56.639
But he's as English as Alex and I.

56:58.625 --> 56:59.717
Give me your hand

57:00.881 --> 57:05.532
Now he owns most of the casinos and brothels
from here to Novus Brusk

57:07.893 --> 57:11.740
Once, he bragged to Alexander that he had every man killed

57:12.019 --> 57:13.904
his wife had slept with before she met him.

57:15.094 --> 57:18.184
And when he found out how many there had been... he killed her too.

57:20.344 --> 57:21.091
There you are.

57:25.029 --> 57:27.592
What made Pierce think he could take on a guy like that?

57:29.810 --> 57:30.808
It's just who he is.

57:37.826 --> 57:39.800
Could you ever feel like that about someone like me?

57:44.499 --> 57:49.490
I don't regret it, you know. Kissing you.

57:52.586 --> 57:56.595
I have to go check the, umm... the thing...

58:17.644 --> 58:18.595
Where are we going?

58:39.424 --> 58:40.270
The airport?

58:41.437 --> 58:43.282
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

58:47.680 --> 58:49.126
Tie us up, would you?

59:04.457 --> 59:06.528
I wish we'd met in another life, Frank.

59:10.957 --> 59:13.655
Take the next flight back to America,
you'll find what you need in the bag.

59:16.583 --> 59:17.374
Be safe.

59:40.886 --> 59:42.149
But I'm in love with you...

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:08.172
Agent Elise Clifton-Ward.
Identification number "M, F, S, 98495, G"

01:01:18.886 --> 01:01:19.822
<b><font color="green"size="30"> Clearance Authorization Approved </ b></b>

01:01:58.539 --> 01:02:00.153
Well, you've certainly blown your cover now.

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:02.150
I'm ready to give you Pierce.

01:02:15.512 --> 01:02:18.211
You're ready to give me Pierce?

01:02:20.212 --> 01:02:21.230
Well that's interesting.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.540
So you're aren't here to beg me to lift your suspension?

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:27.789
You've actually come to do your job?

01:02:28.931 --> 01:02:32.430
Allow me to ask.
Why now?

01:02:36.576 --> 01:02:38.468
You live with a man for an entire year.

01:02:38.468 --> 01:02:42.220
During which time, we don't get one single useable photograph.

01:02:43.663 --> 01:02:45.727
Now you're ready to give him up?

01:02:49.508 --> 01:02:51.992
It's because of that tourist, isn't it?

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.623
I want to put an end to this
before someone gets killed.

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:10.845
...I wish I could understand your choice in men.

01:03:13.001 --> 01:03:14.425
...The fugitive thief?

01:03:15.845 --> 01:03:18.439
Well, that's exciting, perhaps

01:03:19.314 --> 01:03:23.938
But a school teacher from Wisconsin?

01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:28.520
Who'd have thought your tastes were so provincial?

01:03:29.937 --> 01:03:33.708
- Do you want Pierce or not?
- Yes

01:03:35.689 --> 01:03:37.939
I'm meeting him at a ball. Tonight.

01:03:39.812 --> 01:03:42.095
You know you'll have to wear a wire?

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:23.860
Hello Madam

01:04:55.053 --> 01:04:56.943
"She's moving toward the southeast corner"

01:05:07.054 --> 01:05:08.149
Where've you been?

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.478
I thought you'd never get here.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.147
Really?

01:05:16.428 --> 01:05:17.522
"So tell me"

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:20.349
Is that our man?

01:05:21.742 --> 01:05:23.448
How could you be so sure I was coming?

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.149
I just knew it.

01:05:28.006 --> 01:05:30.834
Fate wouldn't bring me to an evening like this with no reason.

01:05:31.976 --> 01:05:34.701
As soon as you walked in, I knew what the reason was.

01:05:38.482 --> 01:05:41.397
- No?
- No

01:05:47.199 --> 01:05:52.199
"Count Philipe Organza, land owner, big reputation as a swordsman"

01:05:52.838 --> 01:05:54.960
Well, he won't be dueling tonight.

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:25.280
Wait!

01:06:26.874 --> 01:06:29.178
Alexander!
Excuse me.

01:06:29.428 --> 01:06:30.908
It's Pierce, he's here.

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:33.753
He just left her an envelope.  Pull
up the footage, we have his face.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.502
I don't bloody believe this!

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:56.831
Alright, get that moron out of here.

01:06:57.439 --> 01:06:59.865
You shouldn't be -
I can't, I'm sorry.

01:07:16.428 --> 01:07:18.315
Come on, you owe me a dance.

01:07:30.188 --> 01:07:31.267
You shouldn't be here.

01:07:32.045 --> 01:07:34.929
No, Elise.  This is the only
place on earth I should be.

01:07:42.627 --> 01:07:44.114
How did you get in here?

01:07:44.429 --> 01:07:46.093
I told the doorman, you're my wife

01:07:46.093 --> 01:07:47.626
and I wanted to keep an eye on you.

01:07:47.876 --> 01:07:49.459
Italians are big on that kinda thing

01:07:52.337 --> 01:07:54.095
- Leave.
- No.

01:08:00.594 --> 01:08:03.405
Do you like the suit?
You paid for it.

01:08:06.439 --> 01:08:08.893
I've been thinking about your friend Pierce, and his plan.

01:08:09.655 --> 01:08:13.379
So far, I'm thinking it hasn't worked out for him.

01:08:13.874 --> 01:08:14.866
No?

01:08:15.251 --> 01:08:18.192
No, take that gangster guy.

01:08:18.502 --> 01:08:20.689
- Shaw?
- Yeah, Shaw.

01:08:21.241 --> 01:08:25.077
I don't believe that Pierce was prepared for him
being here.  The whole chase.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:29.032
Will you please leave?

01:08:32.126 --> 01:08:33.814
You're kinda worried about me, aren't you?

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:34.830
Yes.

01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:36.844
And I'm worried about you

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:43.179
And I'm not leaving without you

01:08:45.781 --> 01:08:50.032
You were part of the plan.
You were useful, that's all.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:55.000
Why do you think, I saw you on the
train and my heart stopped?

01:08:56.361 --> 01:08:57.576
Leave.

01:09:11.906 --> 01:09:12.937
This way please.

01:09:13.863 --> 01:09:15.429
Excuse me sir, I think you've made a mista--

01:09:37.225 --> 01:09:39.932
"Fondamenta San Giacomo 23, Tonight"

01:09:42.816 --> 01:09:44.127
What's it say?

01:09:49.087 --> 01:09:50.908
What's it say?

01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:04.801
Ms. Ward's boarding the boat.

01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:10.056
"It looks like they've called up her boat, what should I do?"

01:10:11.056 --> 01:10:14.004
She may just be playing with us, let's wait.

01:10:19.087 --> 01:10:21.346
Fondamenta San Giacomo 23, please

01:10:22.122 --> 01:10:24.165
Okay, good.  We have the address.

01:10:24.628 --> 01:10:26.067
I'm going to follow her on the boat.

01:10:26.441 --> 01:10:28.537
I want snipers on all surrounding roofs

01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:30.444
and if you get a visual on Pierce first, call.

01:10:55.363 --> 01:10:56.322
The Commissioner wants a report.

01:11:13.497 --> 01:11:14.245
Hello?

01:11:16.207 --> 01:11:17.527
Let's have a little fun with him

01:11:18.466 --> 01:11:19.965
Please?  (speaking spanish)

01:11:24.123 --> 01:11:26.329
Who are you people?
Where are we going?

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:32.144
Well, I don't know, Alexander. Where are we going?

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:37.371
I'm not Alexander, my name's Frank Tupelo.

01:11:37.934 --> 01:11:40.019
I'm an American citizen and I have rights

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:42.428
I don't care what you call yourself these days

01:11:42.795 --> 01:11:45.623
Your name's Alexander Pierce and you have no rights

01:11:46.245 --> 01:11:49.955
Not until you pay us 744 million pounds back taxes

01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:53.372
Seven hundred and forty-four million?

01:11:53.372 --> 01:11:56.027
Looks like someone else is following our target.

01:12:00.392 --> 01:12:04.926
Reginald Shaw.
Well, this could be fun.

01:12:05.299 --> 01:12:06.793
Alright, stay close but not too close

01:12:06.793 --> 01:12:09.030
- And get the office to send me an interpreter.
- Right.

01:12:09.685 --> 01:12:12.781
Yes, 744 million

01:12:13.686 --> 01:12:17.155
You didn't think we knew about that
bank account in Liechtenstein.

01:12:18.484 --> 01:12:19.566
I don't know what you are talking about

01:12:19.846 --> 01:12:20.442
Listen

01:12:22.253 --> 01:12:23.294
...You asshole.

01:12:25.293 --> 01:12:26.717
I know everything about you.

01:12:27.356 --> 01:12:29.078
I even know how much that face cost.

01:12:30.016 --> 01:12:32.231
24 million wired to a Brazilian surgeon

01:12:32.231 --> 01:12:33.606
from a numbered Swiss bank account.

01:12:33.606 --> 01:12:35.388
I haven't been able to prove it

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.640
...But now I don't have to.

01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:42.326
...Because I just lock you in a box in the basement

01:12:42.326 --> 01:12:44.379
Until you tell me where the money is.

01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:56.544
It's alright.

01:12:57.065 --> 01:12:58.455
It's alright, Frank.

01:13:00.015 --> 01:13:01.669
I know you're not Alexander Pierce

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:05.669
But you know who you are?
You're a moron.

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:10.689
And you're a moron that almost
ruined my £8 million pound sting operation.

01:13:11.204 --> 01:13:12.043
Twice...

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:15.704
So you're going to stay here until this is all over.

01:13:16.002 --> 01:13:18.893
Please, you can't do this
I haven't done anything

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.531
I shouldn't be here.

01:13:21.168 --> 01:13:22.376
Know what I think?

01:13:23.193 --> 01:13:25.733
...I think that this is the one place on Earth

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:27.920
You really should be.

01:13:32.828 --> 01:13:34.876
How was your night at the hotel?

01:13:36.441 --> 01:13:39.099
She's quite something, I'm sure.

01:13:39.099 --> 01:13:41.846
Target is about 200 yards away from destination.

01:13:41.846 --> 01:13:43.879
- We are matching speed.
- Good.

01:13:43.879 --> 01:13:45.127
But don't get too close.

01:13:46.272 --> 01:13:48.085
I don't want to scare Pierce off again.

01:13:57.754 --> 01:13:58.851
We're here.

01:14:04.948 --> 01:14:06.230
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:08.481
I won't be needing you any more this evening.

01:14:58.443 --> 01:14:59.600
Magnificent.

01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:06.817
I've never really understood the love that people devote to each other.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:09.992
Money, yes. Possessions, yes.

01:15:10.415 --> 01:15:15.035
But people are so unreliable, they sicken decay and die.

01:15:15.836 --> 01:15:19.211
But this, this is worth dying for.

01:15:36.943 --> 01:15:38.183
"...such good taste"

01:15:40.287 --> 01:15:41.150
We're live.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.275
Oh, yes, do sit down.

01:15:49.101 --> 01:15:49.911
When are you going in?

01:15:50.851 --> 01:15:52.317
You're welcome to stay and watch

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:54.119
If you can keep your mouth shut

01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:56.991
"You know, Alexander was like a son to me"

01:15:57.518 --> 01:15:58.257
I loved him.

01:15:59.631 --> 01:16:03.867
That brilliant, playful, disrespectful young bastard.

01:16:06.283 --> 01:16:08.096
I even thought he and I were two of a kind.

01:16:09.877 --> 01:16:13.020
I took great pleasure never knowing
what the scamp would do next.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:21.033
Until one day, what he did next...
didn't give me any pleasure at all.

01:16:23.302 --> 01:16:25.555
...You know, in our quaint legal system

01:16:25.555 --> 01:16:26.900
...When a man sleeps with my wife

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.067
...I kill him and her. Get away scot-free

01:16:30.679 --> 01:16:32.627
...Crime of passion as it was called

01:16:33.035 --> 01:16:35.941
But my passion extends to all the things I own

01:16:36.784 --> 01:16:40.223
They are me, they represent me.

01:16:41.178 --> 01:16:48.033
So if a man steals from me, I kill him
... I kill his wife, his children, his mother

01:16:48.627 --> 01:16:50.408
...I might even throw in the family doctor

01:16:50.408 --> 01:16:51.345
for good measure.

01:16:51.596 --> 01:16:54.959
For he has taken from me something for
which I have paid the infinite price.

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:57.675
My Soul.

01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:04.970
That's something these idiots will never understand.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.629
He's not coming, is he?

01:17:28.282 --> 01:17:30.088
He sent you to get the money.

01:17:33.158 --> 01:17:38.710
So where is it?
Where's my money?

01:17:39.782 --> 01:17:43.366
- Where is the safe?
- I don't know.

01:17:43.923 --> 01:17:47.972
Where is the safe?

01:17:47.972 --> 01:17:49.429
I don't know.

01:17:49.429 --> 01:17:51.532
You don't know?

01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:04.243
Is it behind this bookcase here?

01:18:11.068 --> 01:18:13.642
...Or, perhaps

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.299
...This one here

01:18:29.423 --> 01:18:32.143
- Where is the safe?
- ... I don't know, I haven't seen him si--

01:18:32.972 --> 01:18:34.306
Please, you have to do something

01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:35.658
Permission to fire?

01:18:35.658 --> 01:18:38.907
Hold your fire.  I repeat, hold your fire.
Not until Pierce shows himself.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:41.817
You're very beautiful, Elise.

01:18:41.817 --> 01:18:44.115
Try to combine it with a little intelligence.

01:18:44.681 --> 01:18:48.129
- And tell me where the safe is.
- If I knew it, I would tell you.

01:18:52.098 --> 01:18:53.267
In my opinion she knows nothing.

01:18:55.579 --> 01:18:57.971
You have to go in.
They're gonna kill her.

01:18:58.177 --> 01:19:00.396
- Where's my interpreter?
- They're going to kill her.

01:19:00.943 --> 01:19:03.658
- She can handle herself.
- She can handle herself?

01:19:04.861 --> 01:19:06.174
She's one of us.

01:19:07.097 --> 01:19:09.066
Expert in undercover operations.

01:19:09.985 --> 01:19:12.242
When I sent her to Russia to find Pierce

01:19:12.242 --> 01:19:14.190
She went dark.

01:19:14.441 --> 01:19:16.283
...I think she could never quite decide

01:19:16.283 --> 01:19:18.470
If she was with him, or with us.

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:20.366
She's a good agent

01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:22.878
...Except that she invariably falls in love with any man

01:19:22.878 --> 01:19:25.023
That she spends longer than a train ride with.

01:19:27.658 --> 01:19:29.502
Commander Acheson, I'm the interpreter.

01:19:29.502 --> 01:19:30.770
Yes, go!

01:19:40.032 --> 01:19:41.989
If you could provide me with some context...

01:19:44.866 --> 01:19:46.689
...She really doesn't seem

01:19:48.086 --> 01:19:49.407
...To know where it is

01:19:49.835 --> 01:19:51.131
"We should go"

01:19:51.534 --> 01:19:53.079
We give it five more minutes

01:19:53.406 --> 01:19:59.147
If Parce doesn't show -
If Pierce doesn't show, we get rid of the woman and go.

01:20:02.643 --> 01:20:04.798
- Permission to engage?
- Negative.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.616
- Please!
- Not one more word from you.

01:20:11.626 --> 01:20:12.881
They won't kill her.

01:20:14.079 --> 01:20:15.472
Pierce will come.

01:20:16.461 --> 01:20:17.971
He has to come.

01:20:18.971 --> 01:20:20.579
Well alright, let's do it.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.489
No, knife.

01:20:26.618 --> 01:20:27.969
"Engaging target"

01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:32.941
- Negative, that is an order.
- Order the shot.

01:20:33.206 --> 01:20:35.690
Now if you don't tell me where the safe is

01:20:35.897 --> 01:20:39.453
I might be tempted to rearrange your face somewhat

01:20:49.364 --> 01:20:55.504
You'll find life is not quite so giving to an ugly woman.

01:21:04.222 --> 01:21:05.461
You really don't know, do you?

01:21:16.098 --> 01:21:16.807
There!

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.381
Behind the medallion, there!

01:22:00.837 --> 01:22:01.622
Open it.

01:22:06.443 --> 01:22:07.947
There is movement in the courtyard

01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:11.286
Pierce, I knew it

01:22:16.508 --> 01:22:18.632
You know what, he does look a little like you

01:22:22.507 --> 01:22:23.525
No!

01:22:41.176 --> 01:22:42.069
Just try.

01:22:54.725 --> 01:22:56.191
Go on, press it.

01:22:59.205 --> 01:23:01.381
You may try one more time.

01:23:14.145 --> 01:23:15.222
Let her go!

01:23:17.474 --> 01:23:19.194
Oh, my God.

01:23:19.489 --> 01:23:22.057
- You let her leave and I'll open the safe.
- Stop right there.

01:23:24.384 --> 01:23:26.160
...Frank, what in hell?

01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:28.659
Please Elise let me handle this

01:23:30.222 --> 01:23:34.334
I'll say it again, let her go
I'll open the safe.

01:23:35.006 --> 01:23:38.900
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Alexander Pierce.

01:23:39.784 --> 01:23:41.253
This is the man that was driving the boat

01:23:41.253 --> 01:23:44.304
- He is not Alexander Pierce.
- Elise, please.

01:23:44.304 --> 01:23:45.869
What the hell are you doing?

01:23:45.869 --> 01:23:47.213
What the hell is he doing?

01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:48.963
"Permission to engage target?"

01:23:49.245 --> 01:23:50.692
Shut the hell up.

01:23:52.463 --> 01:23:57.411
Alexander, is it you?  Truly?

01:23:58.002 --> 01:23:59.098
Truly.

01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:03.287
Show me your teeth

01:24:05.522 --> 01:24:09.194
Alexander had crooked teeth
Stained from excessive smoking

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:11.768
Braces. Electronic cigarettes.

01:24:12.428 --> 01:24:14.148
He had a higher forehead

01:24:15.523 --> 01:24:17.743
I had a migraine for two weeks after the remodel

01:24:19.175 --> 01:24:22.074
- You sound different
- Voice chip implant

01:24:22.315 --> 01:24:24.409
No, no, I mean the the way you speak

01:24:24.681 --> 01:24:27.846
Yes, that's right, Alexander was English
This man is American

01:24:30.619 --> 01:24:32.958
I've actually gotten so used to the American accent

01:24:32.958 --> 01:24:34.943
that I find it a tad difficult to go back

01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:38.866
That's pathetic, this man is not Alexander Pierce

01:24:39.928 --> 01:24:40.972
He's a tourist!

01:24:43.067 --> 01:24:44.074
A tourist?

01:24:44.286 --> 01:24:46.678
Someone I happened to sit next to on the train

01:24:48.118 --> 01:24:49.462
How would a tourist

01:24:49.929 --> 01:24:52.380
know that you killed every man your wife ever slept with?

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.056
I told him that

01:24:54.056 --> 01:24:56.567
You told a tourist?

01:24:57.006 --> 01:24:59.346
Why would she do that?
It's absurd.

01:25:01.057 --> 01:25:04.690
Well, there's a simple way of finding out

01:25:08.223 --> 01:25:11.658
- Open the safe
- I've made you a deal

01:24:30.579 --> 01:24:31.001
...When she's gone

01:25:13.646 --> 01:25:14.090
What are you doing?

01:25:14.426 --> 01:25:15.786
...and I know she's safe

01:25:16.132 --> 01:25:17.020
...Then

01:25:17.987 --> 01:25:19.945
Well... I'll make you an even better deal

01:25:20.897 --> 01:25:22.239
Open the safe now...

01:25:23.026 --> 01:25:26.540
And I won't make you watch something
that you would never forget.

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:29.677
Open it!

01:25:35.290 --> 01:25:36.238
I see

01:25:37.614 --> 01:25:38.791
Now you see?

01:25:55.988 --> 01:25:58.634
- ...Sir
- I know him, he'll come for her

01:26:00.132 --> 01:26:01.332
I know him

01:26:01.582 --> 01:26:02.864
He won't give her up now

01:26:03.112 --> 01:26:04.278
"We must engage."

01:26:04.278 --> 01:26:07.082
"Permission to engage, sir?"

01:26:08.427 --> 01:26:09.611
Sir...

01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:17.237
I love you

01:26:40.225 --> 01:26:41.269
He'll come for her

01:26:42.399 --> 01:26:43.724
He'll come for her,
he doesn't make se-

01:26:44.819 --> 01:26:47.240
This is Chief Inspector Jones, permission granted!

01:26:48.895 --> 01:26:49.662
Fire!

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:51.384
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

01:27:52.353 --> 01:27:54.423
Agent Ward, your suspension's lifted

01:27:55.394 --> 01:27:56.426
Thank you, sir

01:27:56.426 --> 01:28:00.410
And your employment is terminated,
effective immediately.

01:28:01.084 --> 01:28:02.570
Thank you, sir

01:28:05.861 --> 01:28:07.875
"We got him, we got Alexander Pearce."

01:28:08.234 --> 01:28:08.925
Where?

01:28:09.252 --> 01:28:12.238
"On the vondameta, 300 meters south of your location."

01:28:30.515 --> 01:28:31.954
So, you love me?

01:28:40.987 --> 01:28:42.127
I do.

01:28:44.739 --> 01:28:47.484
How do you feel about Alexander Pierce these days?

01:28:49.725 --> 01:28:52.673
I love him too, unfortunately

01:28:56.738 --> 01:28:58.453
I may have a solution for you

01:29:30.564 --> 01:29:32.239
Are you with me this time?

01:29:57.444 --> 01:29:58.213
Come on, let him up.

01:30:00.321 --> 01:30:01.258
I'm just a tourist.

01:30:05.241 --> 01:30:06.197
Just a tourist.

01:30:07.788 --> 01:30:09.811
He said I might get arrested at some point

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:10.657
What?

01:30:11.050 --> 01:30:14.080
But that you'd have to let me go because you have nothing on me

01:30:14.676 --> 01:30:15.186
Who?

01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:17.498
The man who's been sending me these texts

01:30:18.207 --> 01:30:18.893
Texts?

01:30:20.106 --> 01:30:21.311
And the money, of course.

01:30:27.344 --> 01:30:30.343
So let me get this straight because I'm... a little confused

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:33.422
You received money from a man you've never met before?

01:30:34.123 --> 01:30:38.576
Who sends you text messages telling you
just to show up somewhere

01:30:39.141 --> 01:30:39.998
Well...

01:30:43.952 --> 01:30:45.186
Not just anywhere...

01:30:56.872 --> 01:30:57.687
Clear!

01:31:19.311 --> 01:31:21.623
Seven hundred and fourty four million

01:31:29.673 --> 01:31:33.780
Inspector Acheson, this operation has been officially terminated.

01:31:34.361 --> 01:31:35.842
I'll expect your report on Monday.

01:31:36.122 --> 01:31:37.830
- Sir, listen
- We have our money, Acheson

01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:39.779
But we don't have Pierce.

01:31:40.612 --> 01:31:43.121
The man is a criminal wanted in 14 countries

01:31:44.058 --> 01:31:46.999
But what is it he did?  Really?

01:31:47.357 --> 01:31:51.091
He stole the money from a gangster. A dead gangster.

01:31:51.418 --> 01:31:53.080
And he has good taste in women.

01:31:54.558 --> 01:31:56.810
I can't say I don't wish him well.

01:32:35.481 --> 01:32:38.154
Twenty million dollars on plastic surgery...

01:32:38.873 --> 01:32:40.842
And that's the face you choose?

01:32:41.408 --> 01:32:44.454
- Do you not like it?
- It'll do.
