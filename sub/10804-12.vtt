WEBVTT

00:46.715 --> 00:48.717
Ellie, come here.

00:52.846 --> 00:54.764
- How are your hands?

00:54.848 --> 00:56.349
They hurt.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.267
It's 'cause you're bending your wrist.

00:59.561 --> 01:01.855
--Hmm.

01:01.938 --> 01:03.231
Make a fist.

01:03.982 --> 01:05.358
Lock your wrist.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.526
All right. This is a punch.

01:07.611 --> 01:10.238
This is a punch.
This is a punch.

01:12.866 --> 01:14.075
That's shit.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.995
Lock your wrist,
breathe like I taught you.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.372
-There's a man watching us.
-Forget him.

01:19.455 --> 01:20.957
He's not watching them.
He's watching me.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.627
The fight is that way, girl.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.586
Go out and finish it.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.181
-She's impressive.
-Yeah.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.975
Where did you say you found her, again?

01:39.058 --> 01:41.394
Box of Cracker Jacks.

01:45.732 --> 01:47.817
Still needs refining.

01:47.901 --> 01:52.697
Perhaps with more discipline
or different training.

01:52.781 --> 01:54.198
Left hand up, child.

02:02.206 --> 02:06.252
When the war finally comes,
we're gonna need real warriors.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.933
You were saying?

02:24.813 --> 02:26.480
She's killing him!

02:26.564 --> 02:28.566
No shit. Ellie.

02:28.650 --> 02:30.819
--Ellie!

02:34.280 --> 02:36.741
--Ellie. Ellie.

02:38.743 --> 02:40.119
Slow it down.

02:41.037 --> 02:42.455
Drop your breath.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.416
- Breathe in your stomach.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.126
Nice work.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.502
You told me to fight.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.254
You told me to finish it.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.048
I didn't tell you to kill him.

02:52.131 --> 02:55.176
He is an asshole,
but at the end of the day,

02:55.259 --> 02:57.636
he's on our side of the war.

02:57.721 --> 02:59.931
And it's wrong to kill one of ours.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.515
It didn't feel wrong.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.686
Listen.

03:07.856 --> 03:10.483
Whatever it is that you got inside you...

03:12.193 --> 03:16.614
whatever it is that burns so hot,
that's good.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.575
But you gotta learn to control it.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.746
You said we're going to war.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.705
We are.

03:24.789 --> 03:29.460
And there'll be a time and place
for you to turn yourself loose.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.962
But right now,

03:31.045 --> 03:33.672
the last thing you want
is for everybody here to be...

03:33.757 --> 03:35.967
scared shitless of you.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.970
Tame that fire...

03:39.053 --> 03:40.847
or they'll tame it for you.

03:41.973 --> 03:43.641
Get me?

03:43.725 --> 03:45.184
-I get you.
-Good.

03:45.268 --> 03:48.146
'Cause that was just a warm-up.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.024
Come on out here.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.861
Show me what you can really do.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.785
That the best you can do?

04:01.868 --> 04:03.202
You haven't seen my best.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.288
Well, what are you waiting for?
Christmas?

04:24.723 --> 04:27.685
-You tried to have me killed.
-You got that right.

04:27.769 --> 04:30.313
-Why, Stick?
-It's a long story.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.882
Now, what do you think you're doing?

04:57.966 --> 04:59.717
You have no right here, Matthew.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.886
Too little, too late, Matty.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.931
-Get out or get hurt.
-That's not happening, Stick!

05:05.974 --> 05:08.559
- I'm not gonna let you kill him.
- Not your choice.

05:10.895 --> 05:13.106
He raised you, Elektra.

05:13.189 --> 05:14.273
Then he tried to kill me!

05:16.150 --> 05:17.944
I should've done it years ago.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.612
Shut up, Stick.
You're just as bad as she is.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.197
Not quite.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.491
I tried to housebreak her.
Impossible.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.035
You're just another old man
jealous of his disciple.

05:26.119 --> 05:30.164
You'd rather see me dead than outgrow you.
Well, guess what?

05:30.248 --> 05:34.043
When it comes to killing,
I've always been better.

05:34.961 --> 05:36.963
-Put up or shut up.
-No! Put it down!

06:18.004 --> 06:19.380
They're gone.

06:20.965 --> 06:22.550
Yeah. And they took Stick.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.734
How do they do that?

06:40.818 --> 06:41.860
Why did you interrupt us?

06:41.945 --> 06:43.571
Because you would have
killed him, Elektra.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.615
Yes! Before he killed me.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.326
Is that so offensive
to your precious "code"?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.286
Tell me this.
Why does Stick want you dead?

06:50.369 --> 06:51.370
What does it matter?

06:51.454 --> 06:53.622
It matters because Stick never does
anything without a reason.

06:53.706 --> 06:55.458
All right?
And the Hand, they didn't kill him.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.710
They captured him,
which means he knows something.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.754
And they're gonna rip him to shreds
until they find out what it is.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.173
Good.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.424
Unless...

07:04.383 --> 07:05.884
Unless we get there first.

07:07.345 --> 07:09.430
You want me to help you save the man
who ordered my death?

07:09.513 --> 07:10.764
Yes.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.393
You really do hate me.

07:14.477 --> 07:15.769
No, Elektra.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.107
This isn't about you, all right?
This is about Stick.

07:19.190 --> 07:21.067
I need to know why the Hand took him.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.736
And more importantly,
what they're planning next.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.571
I'm done fighting his war.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.906
All right, fine.
Then I'm gonna go alone.

07:27.991 --> 07:30.659
You've pushed everyone out of your life...

07:30.743 --> 07:32.495
and now you want to put
the little you have left

07:32.578 --> 07:34.288
on protecting
that broken old man?

07:34.372 --> 07:37.541
That broken old man...
He gave me a life when I was...

07:37.625 --> 07:39.961
When I had nothing, when I was alone.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.046
He was the one who was there for me.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.382
He abandoned you.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.676
Just when you needed him the most...

07:49.303 --> 07:50.513
because that's what he does.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.806
I don't care what Stick did.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.269
I'm gonna save him.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.897
Not if I get to him first.

08:02.150 --> 08:03.942
I'm going to kill him.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.905
And if you get in my way, Matthew...

08:08.990 --> 08:10.658
I'm gonna kill you, too.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.352
- Ready?

09:19.435 --> 09:20.894
Yeah.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.188
All right.

09:43.501 --> 09:44.752
Also, uh, let's...

09:44.835 --> 09:47.630
I know that the fingerprints
were probably burned...

09:47.713 --> 09:49.757
But let's get some prints taken anyways.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.057
You know you can go home now, right?

10:00.809 --> 10:02.060
Uh, yeah.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.313
You don't need anything else?

10:04.397 --> 10:05.564
I have your statement.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.359
If I have any more questions,
I can track you down.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.153
And don't worry...

10:10.236 --> 10:13.489
that so-called
"police protection" I gave you?

10:13.572 --> 10:15.658
They're crossing guards in Yonkers now.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.036
What? No.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.413
No, no, no.
Brett, really, there's...

10:20.496 --> 10:22.039
There's nothing they could do.
It wasn't their fault.

10:22.123 --> 10:23.541
Frank followed me.
He kidnapped me.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.918
Well, thank Christ
you managed to get away.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.629
Not many people can say that
about the Punisher.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.923
- Seriously, go home.

10:31.006 --> 10:34.218
Get some sleep.
Ambien's the real deal.

10:36.304 --> 10:37.305
Look...

10:38.639 --> 10:40.641
I know what you're thinking.

10:41.559 --> 10:45.396
Maybe Castle survived.
Maybe he's still out there.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.730
He ain't.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.067
How can you be sure?
You ID him yet?

10:51.194 --> 10:53.196
There's 20 burned bodies.
It takes time.

10:53.279 --> 10:56.199
-So there's a chance.
-You saw the same explosion I did.

10:57.408 --> 10:58.992
You're safe, Karen.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.162
That nightmare you've been living,
it's over.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.080
Frank Castle's a dead man.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.168
-Thompson!
-Huh?

11:07.251 --> 11:10.379
Get her a lift.
Wherever she wants to go.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.381
Get out of here, Karen.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.111
Hey.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.113
Sorry, just, uh, research.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.823
Looking for something.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.200
I paid the electric bill
through the end of the month, so...

11:40.284 --> 11:42.328
enjoy it while you can.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.912
And then what?

11:45.205 --> 11:46.582
And then it'll be cold and dark.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.004
It's really over, huh?

11:52.087 --> 11:53.256
Nelson and Murdock?

11:54.507 --> 11:57.593
You told me to move on.
That's what I'm doing.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.933
Look, Foggy...

12:07.561 --> 12:09.563
I'm sorry I never made it
to the hospital.

12:09.647 --> 12:10.814
It's been...

12:12.525 --> 12:15.110
-a crazy couple of days.
-I heard.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.071
Marci came by, though.

12:18.155 --> 12:19.407
Some of the higher-ups at her firm

12:19.490 --> 12:21.409
were impressed with my opening argument
in the Castle case.

12:22.285 --> 12:23.619
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

12:24.703 --> 12:27.039
Neither am I.
Not anymore.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.043
Castle case was in many ways a disaster,
but...

12:31.126 --> 12:33.421
it made me realize
I'm really good at my job.

12:35.423 --> 12:37.841
Nelson and Murdock
was never just your job.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.386
It was you.

12:41.387 --> 12:43.597
You're there for every client
who comes through the door.

12:43.681 --> 12:45.140
Rich, poor...

12:46.266 --> 12:47.476
doesn't matter.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.399
You're the heart of this place.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.946
You gonna try to convince me
it's worth another shot?

13:02.450 --> 13:03.951
No.

13:11.584 --> 13:13.586
Oh, hey, look, I'm...
I'm done here anyway.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.588
So... you stay. I'll go.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.758
What are you looking for?

13:19.842 --> 13:22.428
You really wanna know?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.556
Sure.

13:27.182 --> 13:31.186
Well, there's this...
group that I've been following.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.772
They move through the city,
and then they just...

13:33.856 --> 13:34.857
disappear.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.400
Like magic.

13:36.484 --> 13:39.194
The last place I had a fix on them
was 49th and 10th.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.363
Then they were gone.

13:40.446 --> 13:43.115
I thought maybe they
might be using the subway tunnels.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.408
Only if they're idiots.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.703
Subway tunnels are heavily patrolled
and dangerous as shit.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.915
My grandfather used to tell me stories
about abandoned railway tunnels.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.543
-Abandoned? Why?
-They kept caving in.

13:54.627 --> 13:57.004
Cost a ton. The city just finally
threw in the towel...

13:57.087 --> 13:58.381
Gated them up.

13:58.464 --> 14:00.257
Best thing to ever happen
to bootleggers like Grandpa.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.593
Said he could go for miles
without seeing daylight.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.429
Whoever this group is...

14:05.513 --> 14:08.432
forget magic.
Look for manhole covers.

14:08.516 --> 14:10.893
Yeah, that's...
Thank you, Foggy.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.936
That's really good work.
Thank you.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.647
That's what I do.

14:16.649 --> 14:17.816
Hey, you, uh...

14:22.780 --> 14:24.322
What?

14:27.242 --> 14:28.536
Did you want me to convince you?

14:28.619 --> 14:30.746
-Of what?
-This.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.916
Us. You know,
giving Nelson and Murdock another shot?

14:34.708 --> 14:35.793
I was hoping you would.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.795
Relieved when you didn't.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.715
Last step was us both admitting it.

14:41.799 --> 14:44.885
Now... we're done.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.028
Hey.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.656
Hey, I've got a guy
on the scanners here.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.241
He tells me 20 people are dead.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.743
Yeah, well, I wasn't one of 'em.

15:50.826 --> 15:53.286
Yeah. Well, thank God.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.371
Huh?

15:58.542 --> 16:01.086
--So, uh, what, that's...

16:01.169 --> 16:04.214
the third time you've been in
Frank Castle's crosshairs and escaped?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.675
Just lucky, I guess.

16:06.759 --> 16:08.636
Yeah, well, we both know
that's a load of shit,

16:08.719 --> 16:10.554
but, you know,
just in case I'm deposed one day,

16:10.638 --> 16:13.056
we'll say you're the luckiest lady
on the planet. Deal?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.434
Great, great.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.312
How's the, um...
How's the story coming?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.314
-There isn't one.
-How do you figure?

16:21.398 --> 16:22.941
Because everyone is dead.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.153
Reyes, Blacksmith, Frank Castle.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.530
-They're all dead.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.990
So anyone who was involved
in the cover-up,

16:30.073 --> 16:31.199
or screwed over by it, is gone.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.993
So there are no more stakes.
There's no reason to write it.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.162
So what am I supposed
to fill Sunday's paper with?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.248
Crossword puzzles.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.042
Look, look, Karen, Karen...

16:40.125 --> 16:43.045
I understand that this whole
journalism thing is new to you,

16:43.128 --> 16:45.088
but a real journalist
doesn't just up and quit.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.508
-Well, that's not fair.
-That's exactly fair!

16:48.133 --> 16:49.968
Stories don't disappear, they...

16:50.052 --> 16:51.428
they change.
They become different stories.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.555
Change?

16:52.638 --> 16:54.765
I'm exhausted.
I need to go home.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.017
I need... I need a shower.
I need to eat, I need to sleep.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.268
I...

16:58.351 --> 17:03.273
Why do you care so much
about Frank Castle? Hmm?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.692
I mean, maybe once upon a time

17:04.775 --> 17:06.694
this was about whether or not
he was innocent or some sort of,

17:06.777 --> 17:07.986
you know, psycho murderer,

17:08.070 --> 17:10.030
but that ship sailed a long time ago,

17:10.113 --> 17:12.115
along with your career
at Nelson and Murdock.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.827
So...
So why do you still care?

17:14.910 --> 17:17.287
Because he is not
a psycho murderer.

17:18.706 --> 17:21.041
He wasn't a psycho murderer.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.670
I don't know how you...
He killed 30-something people.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.591
His family was gunned down
in front of his face.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.093
Now, what he did was wrong...

17:32.094 --> 17:33.637
but no one, including your paper,

17:33.721 --> 17:35.723
ever mentioned the fact
that he was a father...

17:35.806 --> 17:36.974
and a husband, grieving,

17:37.057 --> 17:39.517
looking for answers,
and you, more than anyone,

17:39.602 --> 17:41.436
should understand why that matters to me.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.774
So you're...
you're saying there's more to him.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.781
-Yes.
-So is this story over?

17:56.201 --> 17:57.703
Fine.

17:57.786 --> 17:58.871
-You're right.
-Yeah, I know.

17:59.663 --> 18:00.748
Get used to it.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.666
So, what?
So, it's not...

18:02.750 --> 18:05.085
it's not an exposé anymore, it's what?

18:05.168 --> 18:08.505
-It's a... profile?
-Yeah.

18:08.589 --> 18:12.134
Which means...
I need more sources.

18:12.217 --> 18:14.094
Uh, like personal contacts, right?

18:14.177 --> 18:15.470
Like someone who knew him
outside the trial?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.139
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Sunday's coming.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.516
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

18:22.185 --> 18:24.187
I might be able to get someone.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.272
Maybe.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.858
- Okay.
- Uh, leave it.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.485
It's time to face the truth, Karen Page.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.904
This is your home now.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.865
Go.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.195
Thank you for seeing me so late.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.655
I hope I'm not disturbing your family.

20:38.739 --> 20:40.991
Oh, no, no, no.
I have teenagers.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.911
They haven't been home
on a Friday night in years.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.789
Can I get you some coffee?

20:46.872 --> 20:48.874
You know, no, thanks,
I'm ten cups in already.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.376
Ah, Castle would call that "a good start."

20:53.003 --> 20:55.338
I know I'm old.
My wife calls me cranky.

20:56.131 --> 20:59.551
All the violence these days,
the media would have you believe

20:59.634 --> 21:01.553
that that's all there is in the world.

21:03.013 --> 21:05.682
I'm glad you're writing
this article about Frank.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.559
The real Frank.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.269
-Well, that's the goal.
-Uh-huh.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.230
To show people that Mr. Castle
wasn't just the Punisher.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.440
Right, although...

21:13.523 --> 21:16.944
how is it a lawyer
is writing for a newspaper?

21:17.027 --> 21:19.446
Uh, no. I was a legal assistant.

21:19.529 --> 21:20.738
Past tense?

21:21.656 --> 21:23.741
Uh, turns out,
I just have a knack for this.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.078
Oh, I see.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.495
Uh, may I?

21:27.579 --> 21:29.164
Oh, yes, of course.
That's what they're there for.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.623
Thanks.

21:32.584 --> 21:36.463
During the trial, you talked aloud
about Castle as a Marine.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.755
Our primary bond.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.593
Mmm. Talked about respect and gratitude.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.307
You know, honestly...

21:47.390 --> 21:51.144
you're the only person I can find that has
anything kind at all to say about him.

21:52.229 --> 21:54.106
-Mmm.
-So I, um...

21:55.482 --> 21:57.400
I guess my question is...

21:58.485 --> 21:59.694
did you like him?

22:02.072 --> 22:03.781
-Like him?
-Well, like, um...

22:04.908 --> 22:07.452
as a man? As a... a friend?

22:09.830 --> 22:11.289
You know, it's funny.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.708
When you're fighting a war,
you don't really make friends.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.169
At least, not if
you're fighting it the right way.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.379
Mmm.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.422
I suppose you don't want
to get close to anyone,

22:19.506 --> 22:22.259
because, hey, you're...

22:22.342 --> 22:23.927
you're not all coming back.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.679
But at the same time, you...

22:26.763 --> 22:28.556
you have to feel something, don't you?

22:29.933 --> 22:31.434
Otherwise, what are you all fighting for?

22:36.231 --> 22:40.610
I remember Frank
used to sing this horrible little song.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.905
He had, uh,
picked it up, I think,

22:42.988 --> 22:44.822
from one of his kids' TV shows
when he was on leave,

22:44.907 --> 22:46.866
and he brought it back
to Afghanistan with him,

22:46.950 --> 22:49.202
and it was infectious.

22:49.286 --> 22:51.329
- It went through everything like a virus.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.957
Worse than malaria.
Used to crack him up.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.833
I don't know...

22:55.918 --> 22:57.585
I don't know
that I ever saw Frank like that.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.213
You probably never saw him
do impressions, either.

23:00.297 --> 23:01.548
- Impressions?
- Yes.

23:01.631 --> 23:02.632
Of, like, famous people?

23:02.715 --> 23:06.803
Uh, well, I only ever saw him do me,
but he had a knack for it, really.

23:06.886 --> 23:11.224
A sixth sense about
ticks and subconscious behaviors,

23:11.308 --> 23:13.101
and the way a brain works.

23:14.061 --> 23:16.313
It was spot-on, really.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.191
Unnerving, the way he could
look into a person's soul.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.698
I think I know what you mean.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.116
Well...

23:29.492 --> 23:34.081
wherever Frank is now, I hope he finds
that better part of himself again.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.755
Uh, Colonel...

23:45.508 --> 23:48.303
did you happen to catch
the news last night?

23:48.386 --> 23:50.555
Um, there was a shipyard explosion.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.934
Yes. Yes, I think I did hear
something about that.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.062
A drug deal gone south
or something?

23:57.145 --> 23:58.688
-Right. Yes, something like that.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.109
Uh, well, just between you and me, um...

24:03.485 --> 24:06.821
the NYPD's keeping things under wraps
until the investigation is complete.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.115
But...

24:10.950 --> 24:12.369
Frank was involved.

24:12.452 --> 24:13.828
Oh.

24:14.997 --> 24:17.040
He was on the ship when it went up.

24:21.003 --> 24:22.295
Police are sure?

24:22.379 --> 24:24.422
Uh, well, they don't have
an ID yet, but...

24:25.423 --> 24:27.300
Sorry, I just...

24:30.345 --> 24:33.098
You know, I was at the docks all night,
into the morning,

24:33.181 --> 24:34.932
watching them just pull bodies
out of the water,

24:35.017 --> 24:37.269
and there's no way anyone could've...

24:50.240 --> 24:53.910
After a war,
some men turn their backs on you.

24:55.412 --> 24:56.829
They want to forget.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.666
Not Gosnell.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.544
No.

25:03.836 --> 25:08.841
He took the worst part of an IED
on a recon, north of Kabul.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.843
Left half his face on a dirt road.

25:10.927 --> 25:14.013
Spent the better part of a year
in a hospital...

25:14.097 --> 25:16.641
but that kid never gave up.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.227
Never gave in.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.484
It's late.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.405
I'll get out of your hair.
I think I have everything that I need.

25:32.740 --> 25:35.577
Once he got out, he tracked me down.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.496
Asked me how he could serve me again.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.750
That boy was the definition of "loyal."

25:47.797 --> 25:49.216
Or was.

25:50.425 --> 25:53.261
- Before Frank Castle murdered him.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.430
Colonel, please. I just...

25:56.348 --> 25:58.266
I just think I should go.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.643
I'll walk you out.

27:13.007 --> 27:15.134
You're doing it wrong, kid.

27:16.010 --> 27:19.306
If you can hear me,
we got a shot.

27:19.389 --> 27:20.432
He's delirious.

27:20.515 --> 27:22.975
- Then we change tactics.

27:23.059 --> 27:27.397
I give you one last opportunity
to keep this conversation civilized.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.191
Listen very carefully.

27:29.274 --> 27:31.318
You've been tracking their weapons.

27:31.401 --> 27:32.985
So they dropped 'em.

27:42.412 --> 27:45.373
Tracking heartbeats is kids' stuff.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.166
Time to go deeper.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.710
Track their breath.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.714
Sooner or later, they gotta...

27:52.797 --> 27:54.632
exhale.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.175
When they do...

27:56.259 --> 27:58.386
--Where is it?

27:58.470 --> 27:59.887
...kick their ass.

28:21.993 --> 28:23.119
Nice work, kid.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.288
He leaves us no choice.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.333
Sit back and relax.

28:28.416 --> 28:29.709
Relax, shiro.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.712
The answer will come
to you soon, I am sure.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.147
Listen, I won't write the story.
I won't write anything.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.857
- Shut up.
- I'll...

28:52.940 --> 28:54.984
Look, no one will be suspicious,
I'm not even a real reporter.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.444
Just get in the car.

29:04.661 --> 29:05.870
Start the car.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.670
Where are we going?

29:13.753 --> 29:15.171
Start the goddamn car.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.885
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Don't make any--

29:29.936 --> 29:31.771
Start driving.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.230
Drive!

29:35.900 --> 29:37.694
- Turn that shit off.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.742
Could've been smart.

29:45.618 --> 29:48.413
Could've let the story go down
with that boat.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.415
"The real Castle."

29:50.498 --> 29:52.166
Like you cared about him.

29:56.338 --> 29:57.589
Yeah, pull over here.

29:59.882 --> 30:00.842
Pull over.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.465
Is he close?

30:42.133 --> 30:45.637
Perhaps. It does not matter.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.430
We will continue until he breaks.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.991
Only thing gonna crack tonight

31:07.074 --> 31:10.787
is your skull... asshole!

31:38.272 --> 31:39.691
You okay?

31:39.774 --> 31:41.317
I've been better.

31:42.735 --> 31:43.820
Come on.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.448
--You did good, kid.

31:46.531 --> 31:47.865
You did good.

31:49.617 --> 31:52.662
No, I just...
I just did what you taught me, Stick.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.497
Matty, I'm...

31:55.582 --> 31:56.708
proud of you.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.380
Come on, old man.
Let's get you out of here.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.094
Hello, boys.

32:11.013 --> 32:14.350
Do you remember when we met...

32:14.434 --> 32:17.479
you told me you'd never abandon me?

32:19.146 --> 32:21.941
It's funny. For the life of me...

32:22.024 --> 32:25.194
I can't remember
being so naive I'd believe you.

32:26.779 --> 32:27.822
But I did.

32:29.323 --> 32:31.242
And now here we are.

32:31.325 --> 32:32.785
-Elektra.
-Don't be a bore, Matthew.

32:32.869 --> 32:36.581
Why don't you scurry out of here
and let me finish what I came to do?

32:42.044 --> 32:43.838
I told you,
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

32:43.921 --> 32:45.840
And I told you, too bad.

32:45.923 --> 32:48.050
-You let her track you.
-She's not gonna hurt you, Stick.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.763
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:51.846 --> 32:52.930
Look at that.

32:53.014 --> 32:57.268
After all you've done,
you're still a disappointment to Daddy.

32:57.351 --> 33:00.187
-I'm getting him out of here.
-He's not going anywhere.

33:00.271 --> 33:05.359
Neither are you, child.
They got you right where they want you.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.154
It's painful, raising children.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.907
We spend our lives
teaching them to be strong,

33:10.990 --> 33:13.034
to be independent.

33:13.117 --> 33:16.078
Not realizing that
once we have achieved that...

33:16.913 --> 33:19.165
they are no longer in our control.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.750
Nobu.

33:29.425 --> 33:30.968
Tell them.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.345
Tell them why we're all here tonight.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.431
You...

33:35.515 --> 33:37.559
the loyal one...

33:37.642 --> 33:38.935
and it.

34:10.758 --> 34:14.345
I'm sorry about before.
I should've stopped, but...

34:40.537 --> 34:42.915
Did you really think you could
get away with bringing it here?

34:42.999 --> 34:44.541
Your kid attacked her.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.502
You've endangered all of us.

34:46.586 --> 34:48.420
You know what they'll do to you
when they find out?

34:48.504 --> 34:50.673
There are larger pieces at play here.

34:50.757 --> 34:52.299
Oh, you're out of your mind.

34:52.383 --> 34:55.762
You know what it is, what it can do.

34:55.845 --> 34:57.096
Stop.

34:57.179 --> 35:00.224
You've gone soft for that thing,
Stick.

35:01.601 --> 35:04.604
If you won't kill it... I will.

35:04.687 --> 35:07.148
Just stop. You're right.

35:07.231 --> 35:09.651
She's my responsibility.

35:12.361 --> 35:14.656
I'll take care of her.

35:28.920 --> 35:29.962
Gotta go.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.467
Nobu, you let these two go...

35:35.551 --> 35:37.094
and you can have me.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.930
I need it.

35:39.013 --> 35:40.890
Call me "it" again
and I'll cut you in half.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.851
You are right, Elektra.

35:43.935 --> 35:46.062
You're not a girl anymore.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.855
But now, seeing you fight,

35:47.939 --> 35:51.067
seeing you with the man
who saved your life...

35:51.150 --> 35:53.235
I'd know you anywhere.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.405
Do you know who we are?

35:57.657 --> 35:59.200
You call yourselves the Hand.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.452
Do you know who we serve?

36:01.535 --> 36:04.956
Yeah. Some mythical piece of shit
called the Black Sky.

36:05.039 --> 36:06.207
What is this?

36:07.333 --> 36:10.294
The end of the war you don't believe in.

36:10.377 --> 36:11.796
We just lost.

36:11.879 --> 36:15.717
The Black Sky... is not a myth.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.095
We have wanted you since you were a child.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.637
You were taken from us...

36:20.722 --> 36:23.557
but now you have returned.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.393
What the hell are you talking about?

36:27.519 --> 36:28.645
It's you, Elektra.

36:29.563 --> 36:32.358
You are the Black Sky.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.236
Our greatest living weapon.

36:35.319 --> 36:36.528
No.

36:44.370 --> 36:47.456
Elektra, do not listen to him, all right?
It's a trick.

36:47.539 --> 36:51.418
It's another illusion, another game.
He wants something from you.

36:53.629 --> 36:55.672
He told me I was out of control.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.885
They don't get to tell you what you are.

36:58.968 --> 37:01.137
But you said the same thing.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.764
Well, I was wrong.
No one gets to tell you.

37:03.848 --> 37:05.224
But it makes sense, right?

37:06.142 --> 37:07.226
No.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.147
Only if you let it.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.107
It explains everything.

37:26.662 --> 37:28.915
You knew all along.

37:30.207 --> 37:32.501
Yeah, I did.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.087
That's why they hated me.

37:37.423 --> 37:40.092
That's why everyone eventually does.

37:40.176 --> 37:43.304
Elektra, you still have a choice.
The woman I know is still in there.

37:44.931 --> 37:46.766
Is she?

37:46.849 --> 37:48.893
You are home now.

37:50.186 --> 37:56.233
We live and die
to serve you, Black Sky.

38:01.530 --> 38:02.990
No, Jesus.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.036
-Elektra.
-If what they say is true...

38:07.954 --> 38:11.332
I studied it, as a child,
with the Chaste.

38:12.666 --> 38:15.752
I committed it to memory,
so I could fight it one day.

38:18.798 --> 38:21.342
But there's no fight anymore.

38:23.427 --> 38:24.971
The Black Sky is destiny.

38:25.054 --> 38:27.723
No. Elektra. Elektra.

38:27.807 --> 38:29.016
-Leave me.
-I'm not gonna leave you, I--

38:29.100 --> 38:30.101
Leave!

38:32.103 --> 38:33.437
Why are they taking so long?

38:33.520 --> 38:36.523
This Ambassador and his wife,

38:36.607 --> 38:40.194
the only thing they can't have
is a little girl of their own.

38:40.277 --> 38:41.362
Now, they'll have you.

38:41.445 --> 38:43.030
They'll never have me.

38:45.407 --> 38:48.953
Kid, use your head.
Watch these people.

38:49.036 --> 38:50.579
Watch everything about 'em.

38:50.662 --> 38:54.291
How they walk, how they talk,
how they eat. All of it.

38:54.375 --> 38:58.462
Playing someone else, someone fancy...

39:00.422 --> 39:02.299
that's a good skill
to have in your pocket.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.093
Why can't I stay with you?

39:04.176 --> 39:06.345
'Cause we'll be hunted
the rest of our lives.

39:06.428 --> 39:07.847
We can take them.

39:11.725 --> 39:12.935
Ellie...

39:14.645 --> 39:17.189
I haven't told you everything, but...

39:18.815 --> 39:22.486
someday, someone will come for you.

39:22.569 --> 39:23.988
And everything will change.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.534
I'm gonna make that
as far off as possible.

39:28.617 --> 39:31.871
You'll train someone else.
I know you will.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.960
You... You'll forget about me.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.714
Forget my Ellie?

39:52.349 --> 39:53.642
Never.

40:02.693 --> 40:05.446
I pretended my whole life.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.449
I tried.

40:11.118 --> 40:13.870
I tried to control this inside me.

40:16.207 --> 40:18.542
Maybe I don't have to anymore.

40:20.002 --> 40:22.046
Maybe this is my chance.

40:23.047 --> 40:24.298
To what?

40:26.050 --> 40:27.218
To be loved?

40:31.597 --> 40:33.099
Yes.

40:33.182 --> 40:35.684
Then don't let me get in your way.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.905
I am the enemy of the Hand.

40:51.575 --> 40:52.659
So kill me.

41:07.091 --> 41:09.926
It's too late. Let me go.

41:10.844 --> 41:14.598
Now you could either try and kill us,
and prove them right.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.601
Or you could save Stick...

41:18.894 --> 41:20.812
and prove them wrong.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.690
You never know when to give up, do you?

41:24.233 --> 41:25.234
No.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.779
And neither does he.

42:00.894 --> 42:01.937
Ahh!

43:02.789 --> 43:04.291
Frank.

43:12.716 --> 43:16.178
You should be
at the bottom of the Hudson.

43:16.262 --> 43:20.682
Losing $100 million in heroin
would've been worth it to take you down.

43:20.766 --> 43:22.726
But here we are, huh?

43:24.060 --> 43:26.397
You could've been part of it,
like Gosnell.

43:27.439 --> 43:28.524
You could've been rich.

43:28.607 --> 43:31.527
And maybe you could've taken your family

43:31.610 --> 43:34.280
to the Bahamas
instead of Central Park, huh?

43:38.534 --> 43:39.535
You think this...

43:39.618 --> 43:41.370
all of this...

43:41.453 --> 43:43.455
is about a bad drug deal?

43:43.539 --> 43:46.125
That's what you see.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.420
You're losing your touch, Frank.

43:50.546 --> 43:53.465
Your kids, at the park?

43:53.549 --> 43:57.719
Nah. Who cares?
That's never what this has been about.

43:59.012 --> 44:01.723
It's about what happened with you.

44:01.807 --> 44:04.893
With all of us. Kandahar.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.735
You think they would ever let that go?

44:13.819 --> 44:16.447
- Frank, stop.

44:16.530 --> 44:17.989
You don't have to kill him.

44:18.740 --> 44:19.741
Go back to the car.

44:19.825 --> 44:20.992
What's he talking about?

44:21.076 --> 44:22.953
- Kandahar, what's that...
- What happened?

44:23.036 --> 44:25.331
- Go.
- Did you do something?

44:26.373 --> 44:29.042
If they come after you... Just tell me.
Tell me the truth.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.336
I'll help you.
I'll help you figure it out.

44:30.419 --> 44:33.088
-Just tell me the truth.
-Yeah. Tell her the truth.

44:33.172 --> 44:35.006
Tell me for Maria. Tell me for Lisa.
Tell me for Frank, Jr.

44:35.090 --> 44:36.883
-Tell her what you did.
-You shut up!

44:36.967 --> 44:39.803
- Tell her.
- What happened?

44:39.886 --> 44:41.054
Please, we'll figure it out,

44:41.137 --> 44:43.349
but if you kill him, you will never know.

44:49.145 --> 44:50.647
--No, no, no.

44:50.731 --> 44:52.190
Frank!

44:53.234 --> 44:55.402
Listen to me. Frank!

44:56.487 --> 44:59.531
You do this, and you are the monster
that they say you are. Do you hear me?

45:03.619 --> 45:07.163
You do this, and I am done.
That's it. You're dead to me.

45:07.248 --> 45:08.457
Do you hear me?

45:12.711 --> 45:14.421
I'm already dead.

45:30.896 --> 45:33.982
It's like a candy store in here.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.192
Go ahead.

45:37.110 --> 45:38.779
Go ahead.

45:39.696 --> 45:43.284
I had to teach you how to hold a gun.
You remember?

45:44.493 --> 45:47.663
Eighteen, and you'd
never held a piece before.

45:49.456 --> 45:53.710
Come on. They call you "the Punisher."
Prove it.

45:55.170 --> 45:57.548
Prove you don't need me anymore.

45:59.257 --> 46:00.509
One shot...

46:01.843 --> 46:02.969
one kill.

46:06.222 --> 46:07.349
You taught me that.

46:07.433 --> 46:09.643
You stupid son of a--

46:45.220 --> 46:47.097
Come on. Come on.

46:59.401 --> 47:00.402
Still want to kill me?

47:00.486 --> 47:02.571
Yeah.

47:03.489 --> 47:04.906
But he'd be pissed.

47:07.158 --> 47:12.205
I just saved your ass...
and you're worried about what he thinks?

47:13.081 --> 47:15.584
Matt didn't come to rescue me.

47:15.667 --> 47:16.960
He came to save you.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.712
I don't need to be saved.

47:18.795 --> 47:20.714
From yourself, girl.

47:22.340 --> 47:27.888
He knew that killing me
would've been your point of no return,

47:28.555 --> 47:30.056
so he stopped you.

47:31.433 --> 47:33.602
He thinks you're worth saving.

47:37.606 --> 47:38.774
Earn that.

49:54.743 --> 49:58.454
It will be ours.
You cannot stop what we've started.

49:59.164 --> 50:00.624
Watch me.

50:50.548 --> 50:53.051
Daredevil must die.
