WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.657
MAN:
Attention, unknown vessel.

00:05.701 --> 00:08.269
You have entered United States
territorial waters.

00:08.312 --> 00:11.011
U.S. Coast Guard agents boarding
for inspection. Respond.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.758
Clear.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.112
Smugglers.

00:25.155 --> 00:28.854
Come all this way
just to run out of gas.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.422
Yeah. Looks like they decided
to swim the last stretch.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.468
Are we taking bets
on the cargo?

00:33.511 --> 00:35.774
What do you think,
drugs? Weapons?

00:35.818 --> 00:40.083
Unmarked tramp D.I.W.
off the coast of Norfolk?

00:40.127 --> 00:43.173
Eh... Probably a load of
knock-off sunglasses.

00:43.217 --> 00:47.003
United States Coast Guard!

00:47.047 --> 00:49.266
They bailed.Yeah.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.877
Radio to Skip.

00:51.921 --> 00:55.446
Have them scan the water for
anyone who didn't realize
it's ten miles to shore.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.187
[gunshots]

00:58.710 --> 01:01.931
Coop, you all right?!
Cooper?!

01:01.974 --> 01:05.239
Shots fired on deck.
Man down. Man down!

01:42.058 --> 01:44.321
Ugh. I know that smell.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.062
It's not coming
from here.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.890
Not over here either.

01:47.933 --> 01:51.023
Doesn't he know they do not take
the trash out on weekends?

01:51.067 --> 01:53.243
Why does he order the
same stinky take-out

01:53.287 --> 01:55.854
from the same stinky place?

01:55.898 --> 01:58.683
Because it's the only place open
on Saturday at 2:00 a.m.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.729
He's working weekends.
Did he call you guys

02:00.772 --> 02:02.165
over the weekend, too?

02:02.209 --> 02:03.297
Twice.Twice.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.386
About work that we could
have done today.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.561
Yeah.
Yes.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.780
Isn't 16 hours
a day enough for him?

02:08.824 --> 02:10.478
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I love my work.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.262
I'm just not married
to it, you know.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.873
Wait. I think
I have a solution.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.354
What? A pet for Gibbs?

02:17.398 --> 02:19.095
A new hobby?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.575
A new woman.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.359
That is the last
thing he needs.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.100
Grab your gear.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.101
Agent Borin.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.972
What are you doing here?

02:27.016 --> 02:30.062
Dead Coast Guard petty
officer on a ship towed
into Norfolk Navel Base.

02:30.106 --> 02:33.022
Joint jurisdiction.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.416
Let's go.GIBBS:
You heard her.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.287
Move it.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.205
Aha!

02:42.249 --> 02:44.294
You kept that in
your desk, boss?

02:44.338 --> 02:46.166
Oh, yeah. You waste not,
you want not.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.866
That's one mystery solved.

02:50.909 --> 02:51.736
Maybe two.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.173
What are you
talking about?

02:53.216 --> 02:55.131
A new playmate
for Gibbs.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.133
What, Borin
and Gibbs?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.440
Uh, yeah, no,
not so sure.

02:59.483 --> 03:00.615
They're too similar.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.921
Just means they have
a lot in common.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.361
MAN: The running
lights were on.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.189
There wasn't much sign
of anything else.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.234
We boarded the ship
at 0200.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.367
Coop called out,
but got no response.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.847
We thought the crew
had jumped ship.

03:15.891 --> 03:18.850
But then the muzzle flash came
from across the deck.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.765
BOTH:
You get a look
at the shooter?

03:21.897 --> 03:24.204
He's your man, Agent Borin.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.249
You see the killer?No, ma'am.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.903
When backup arrived,

03:27.946 --> 03:30.079
and searched the ship, no one.

03:30.122 --> 03:33.169
And nothing on board
but bootleg cosmetics.Camouflaged drugs?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.344
No, we checked.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.172
Just creams, moisturizers
and soaps.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.608
You put 'em in the right bottle,

03:37.652 --> 03:39.610
they can sell for more
per ounce than cocaine.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.612
Perfume scent's
giving the dogs hell.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.353
Ship's contents are being
thoroughly cataloged.

03:43.397 --> 03:46.835
And our missing crew?No dust on the sea.
No signs of drowning.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.445
Unfortunately.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.056
Thank you, Petty Officer.Ma'am--

03:51.100 --> 03:53.233
I hope you
find them.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.322
Coop's wife is going to ask me
who did this.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.020
I'd like to have
an answer.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.327
Me, too.

04:09.031 --> 04:12.208
I think Gibbs and Borin
would make a great couple.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.819
Just think of all the
fun they'd have giving
each other head slaps.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.996
Well, head slaps are not
very romantic, Tony.They can be.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.390
In the right context.
Ugh.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.783
The lifeboat is missing.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.828
I think that's how the crew
got off the ship.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.310
Ducky, what do you think?

04:27.354 --> 04:31.183
Gibbs and Borin?
Date mate material?

04:31.227 --> 04:33.273
Well, given their
combined work ethics,

04:33.316 --> 04:34.448
they'd probably never
see each other.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.666
Which could be
a recipe

04:35.710 --> 04:38.495
for the world's
shortest courtship,

04:38.539 --> 04:40.280
or extreme longevity.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.238
So nobody's with me
on team Bibbs?

04:42.282 --> 04:45.154
No.We can change
the name.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.938
Why don't you change
the subject, DiNozzo?

04:46.982 --> 04:49.332
At least let him grill you
a steak in his fireplace

04:49.376 --> 04:51.160
while watching
black and white television.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.336
It's more charming
than you'd think.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.468
I'll pass.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.734
You know what, I do have

04:59.777 --> 05:02.563
a list of girlfriends that
might make good candidates.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.216
They can't just be good.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.262
Don't worry, they
can be bad.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.310
What do you got, McGee?

05:10.353 --> 05:11.311
Found three shells.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.748
Standard NATO rifle cartridges.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.968
Which correspond to
the hits on the body.
One of them was stopped

05:17.012 --> 05:18.753
by the petty officer's armor.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.016
And the other pene...[rhythmic clanking]

05:24.672 --> 05:26.021
Duck?

05:26.064 --> 05:28.328
[clanking continues]

05:29.372 --> 05:30.808
What is it, Dr. Mallard?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.422
Morse code.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.901
It's SOS.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.381
It's coming from below.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.470
McGee, stay here with the body.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.645
You two, with us.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.563
[clanking grows louder]

05:56.530 --> 06:00.316
[clanking grows louder]

06:00.360 --> 06:01.752
GIBBS [whispers]:
No! Shh!

06:04.842 --> 06:07.584
The sound's coming from here.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.371
Lock handle's been snapped off.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.939
DiNozzo.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.212
Americans?

06:29.432 --> 06:33.044
Looks like our missing crew's
smuggling more than cosmetics.

06:33.088 --> 06:37.309
We are from Lebanon.
My family and I wish
asylum in the United States.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.364
I am kind of busy, Leon.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.800
I know. That's why I called.
Update.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.586
Family wants asylum.
We want a killer.

06:52.629 --> 06:55.327
Get the latter,
forget the former.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.416
There something
you want to tell me?

06:56.459 --> 06:57.852
Yes. Under no circumstances

06:57.895 --> 07:00.855
is anyone on that ship
to set foot on U.S. soil.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.552
Why?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.685
Because SecNav and the U.S.
State Department says so.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.556
Lebanon's a key U.S. ally

07:06.600 --> 07:08.819
in a very unstable part
of the world, Gibbs.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.691
If this family claims
political persecution,

07:10.734 --> 07:12.432
the next stop is a
Credible Fear Screening.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.477
Okay, let me guess.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.174
The SecNav doesn't want
any more surprises.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.524
He's had his fair share already?

07:17.567 --> 07:18.873
I think he's looking
for a reason

07:18.916 --> 07:20.352
to get more involved in this

07:20.396 --> 07:21.919
and I don't want
to give him one.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.400
Find the killer.
Nothing more.

07:34.497 --> 07:35.803
Where is my family?

07:35.846 --> 07:38.066
Why have you
separated us?

07:38.109 --> 07:40.460
Standard procedure,
Mr. Bawali.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.463
NCIS.

07:43.506 --> 07:46.814
Is that part of the
Immigration Department?

07:46.857 --> 07:48.859
No. We're investigating
the murder.

07:48.903 --> 07:52.254
Where were you when the
Coast Guard officer was shot?Trapped.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.909
The crew locked us away
as we approached the coast.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.519
So if you were hidden,

07:56.563 --> 07:58.695
and they were just
carrying cosmetics,
why'd they open fire?

07:58.739 --> 08:01.524
You will have to ask them.Couldn't find them.
I found you.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.135
We came here to escape
violence, Agent Gibbs.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.268
I was protesting
an oppressive regime.

08:06.311 --> 08:09.401
They threatened to
kill my family.

08:09.445 --> 08:13.536
I realize Muslim refugees
do not get a great deal of
sympathy in your country.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.755
That's not true.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.539
We take everybody.

08:16.583 --> 08:21.196
We just have rules about
how they get here.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.937
TONY:
And then?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.547
We heard the Coast Guard ship.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.548
One more time.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.636
You heard the
loudspeaker

08:26.680 --> 08:28.508
and then you
heard the gunfire?

08:28.551 --> 08:30.901
Sorry. You know what,
I just want to get the
chronology of events right.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.990
We were told Coast Guard
would turn us back--

08:33.034 --> 08:35.166
that only if we made
land, could we seek asylum.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.646
And after that
you heard the gunfire?

08:36.690 --> 08:38.605
That is what I said.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.607
Mm-hmm.

08:42.652 --> 08:45.002
It's lucky none of you got hurt.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.222
Luck?

08:47.265 --> 08:49.616
If my father had
not put us at risk,

08:49.659 --> 08:51.487
we would still be in our home.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.099
Now we all must suffer in
a country that hates us.

08:55.143 --> 08:57.537
We are not lucky.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.672
Did you hear the
crew use names?No.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.283
But two were Lebanese.
The third was Egyptian.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.372
How do you know that?Their accents.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.591
They're very distinctive.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.028
I went to the University
of Cairo.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.639
Really?

09:12.682 --> 09:13.640
What was your major?

09:13.683 --> 09:15.642
Math and computer science.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.078
Your parents must
be very proud.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.515
My parents are very scared.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.347
ZIVA: Can you describe
the crew members?

09:29.612 --> 09:32.528
I need you to focus,
Ms. Bawali.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.399
Mariam.

09:34.443 --> 09:37.664
My name is Mariam.
Mariam.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.623
The crew?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.625
I think there were three.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.671
I do not remember exactly.

09:46.368 --> 09:49.545
We wish only freedom.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.982
Yet you do not allow
us to go free.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.636
Why?

09:56.247 --> 09:58.075
Do you have family,
Agent David?

10:00.687 --> 10:02.123
Yes.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.648
Then you must know it
is a mother's duty to prote...

10:05.692 --> 10:07.519
What is this?

10:07.563 --> 10:10.131
Fresh food and supplies
for your family.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.350
I know you have been
living on rice and beans.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.875
We don't need charity.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.398
We need freedom.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.141
Lamb.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.059
Potatoes.

10:26.800 --> 10:31.456
You need to feed
your family, Mariam.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.502
Hmm?

10:34.764 --> 10:36.723
You have a good
maternal instinct.

10:36.766 --> 10:40.988
Your parents must be proud
of their daughter.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.685
[wry chuckle]Do you have children,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.382
Agent David?

10:44.426 --> 10:48.038
My name is Ziva.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.780
And uh... [chuckles] no.

10:55.655 --> 11:00.877
I... had, um... a sister,

11:00.921 --> 11:03.967
and, uh, a brother.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.189
I also had a mother.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.277
"Had"?

11:10.539 --> 11:12.062
They were killed.

11:14.064 --> 11:20.288
I, too, have lost people
I cherished.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.770
We come from troubled
lands, you and I.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.382
Well, you...

11:27.425 --> 11:29.036
are here now.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.341
Are we?

11:34.128 --> 11:35.433
McGEE:
Borin wasn't kidding.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.131
Her list of female friends
is longer than mine.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.611
You having page
envy, Tony?

11:39.655 --> 11:42.005
Let's not get into a measuring
contest, McHunt-and-Peck.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.791
Next name: "Stacy DeGraff."

11:44.834 --> 11:45.966
Double "f."

11:46.009 --> 11:47.445
[computer trills]

11:47.489 --> 11:50.753
All right, she's got
a gym membership.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.755
Lives in a nice
Georgetown condo.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.844
DIA analyst.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.150
Ooh, member of Mensa.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.455
Let's get to the good stuff.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.501
And that would be?
Well,

11:59.544 --> 12:01.677
more photos, preferably
something on the beach.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.637
Wow. Tall.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.291
Six- foot-six.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.466
She come with her own beanstalk?

12:08.510 --> 12:10.164
How's operation G-date going?

12:10.207 --> 12:13.558
Borin... do you have
any normal friends?

12:13.602 --> 12:14.908
Turn the page, DiNozzo.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.605
Plenty of babes in those woods.

12:16.648 --> 12:17.911
Just "detect."

12:17.954 --> 12:19.347
She's right.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.741
I've narrowed it down to
three potential candidates.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.481
You talking about
our missing crew, McGee?

12:23.525 --> 12:25.266
[phone rings]Uh, of course, boss.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.702
Borin.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.096
Yeah, I'll be right
down, Dr. Mallard.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.402
Gotta go sign
for the body.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.796
McGEE:
We've, uh, searched
the entire ship.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.798
Found nothing to help ID
our missing crew.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.453
Lifeboat?They're still searching, boss.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.237
Coast Guard's got air
and surface craft

12:40.281 --> 12:42.587
scouring the entire
seaboard north of Back Bay.

12:42.631 --> 12:45.852
All coastal law enforcement
agencies have been put on alert.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.984
If these guys made it ashore,
we'll find them.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.773
One life meets a tragic end.

12:53.816 --> 12:57.167
Others struggle
for a new beginning.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.169
Our family of refugees?

12:59.213 --> 13:01.737
There's an Albanian proverb:

13:01.781 --> 13:05.523
"Fire, water and governments
know nothing of mercy."

13:05.567 --> 13:08.091
Well, their story of
oppression in Lebanon

13:08.135 --> 13:09.701
is pretty hard
to confirm.

13:09.745 --> 13:13.836
Yes, those responsible for that
oppression make sure of that.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.796
It's what makes families
like our stowaways

13:16.839 --> 13:18.580
take desperate measures.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.322
Or illegal measures.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.933
You don't trust them?

13:25.761 --> 13:29.852
You know, I spent three years
on a cutter off Miami.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.855
The ones who make it to shore
are usually the ones

13:32.899 --> 13:35.162
you didn't want
as neighbors.And why is that?

13:35.205 --> 13:38.556
Because they were willing to do
anything to survive.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.689
Yeah. Gut tells me
our Swiss Family Robinson

13:40.732 --> 13:43.692
knows more about our missing
crew than they're saying.

13:43.735 --> 13:45.912
I just can't prove it.Anything we can prove?

13:45.955 --> 13:47.261
Ballistics report from Abby.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.828
DUCKY: The rounds
from the body

13:48.871 --> 13:52.135
were fired from an
American-made M16-A4 rifle.

13:52.179 --> 13:56.487
A specially manufactured M16-A4,
from a shipment of weapons

13:56.531 --> 13:57.924
we sold to the Lebanese
government in '09.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.360
How'd our crew end up with one?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.971
I suspect that is a question

14:02.015 --> 14:06.671
which the SecNav and Director
Vance would not want you to ask.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.021
[cell phone rings]

14:08.064 --> 14:09.239
Yeah, Abbs?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.894
Gibbs, can you come to the lab?Sure.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.113
Be right down.

14:16.986 --> 14:20.729
Welcome to the
disenchanted forest, Gibbs.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.905
What do you got, Abbs?

14:22.949 --> 14:26.909
Um, like, the grossest
clue chain ever.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.303
Yeah, which is?Poop.

14:29.346 --> 14:32.306
Our missing crew-- even
if they took everything

14:32.349 --> 14:34.003
with them when they
jumped ship--

14:34.047 --> 14:36.658
they still would have
left behind their...

14:36.701 --> 14:37.877
"waste products."

14:37.920 --> 14:39.487
Their human waste.
Yes.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.271
[sniffs]

14:41.315 --> 14:43.056
So, it's usually protocol

14:43.099 --> 14:45.188
to empty a ship's septic
tank into the ocean.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.799
So, we had the main
sewage line swabbed.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.714
Who did?
The Coast Guard?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.325
Yeah. They don't mess around,
Gibbs.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.718
Stool samples can carry DNA,

14:53.762 --> 14:56.939
but your intestinal bacteria
that helps you break down food,

14:56.983 --> 14:58.201
it has DNA of its own.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.290
So, your feces

15:00.334 --> 15:02.292
are almost as unique
as a fingerprint.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.554
So you can ID the crew.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.817
No. For that, I'd
have to run, like,

15:05.861 --> 15:08.559
a hundred separate
DNA tests.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.561
But I can settle
for visually determining

15:10.605 --> 15:11.998
the number of unique bacteria.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.130
So you'll know how many
crew members were on board.

15:14.174 --> 15:17.003
I personally examined
every sample.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.439
You're welcome.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.440
Thank you.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.658
And...

15:20.702 --> 15:23.357
Only fresh samples
from the last seven days

15:23.400 --> 15:24.967
contain viable bacteria.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.578
And out of those, I
found only four unique

15:27.622 --> 15:29.580
poop profiles.

15:32.409 --> 15:35.369
Our four family members
are the only people

15:35.412 --> 15:38.633
to use the ship's facilities
in the last week.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.247
There was no crew.Which means

15:44.291 --> 15:46.423
not only is the family
lying to us,

15:46.467 --> 15:48.469
but one of them is our shooter.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.218
I want to speak to the family,
Director Vance.

15:58.261 --> 15:59.871
How do you even
know they're here?

15:59.915 --> 16:02.265
We have our sources
in the State Department.

16:02.309 --> 16:05.660
My organization aids Muslims
trying to seek asylum.

16:05.703 --> 16:06.835
We're trying to seek justice.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.271
[door opening]

16:09.969 --> 16:11.013
JARVIS:
Excuse me.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.886
[door closes]You have no right to restrict

16:14.930 --> 16:17.454
this family's wish to
seek political asylum.

16:17.498 --> 16:18.934
JARVIS:
Actually, we do.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.892
They're stowaways, Ms....

16:20.936 --> 16:23.286
Hooper.
Rebeka.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.723
And they made land
when you towed them into port.

16:25.767 --> 16:26.898
JARVIS: They're still
on board the vessel.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.770
Therefore, legally still at sea.

16:28.813 --> 16:32.643
Being a Muslim woman, I know the
discrimination they're facing.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.123
While I share...JARVIS: This has nothing

16:34.167 --> 16:35.733
to do with them
being Muslim.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.735
Let's make that very clear.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.433
Do you always let
your assistants

16:39.476 --> 16:41.957
interrupt you like this?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.612
This happens to be the Secretary
of the United States Navy.

16:44.655 --> 16:48.746
Ms. Hooper, a member of this
family killed a U.S. serviceman.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.357
HOOPER:
Prove it.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.751
Meanwhile, I'm filing
for an injunction tomorrow,

16:53.795 --> 16:55.231
then going to the media.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.711
It's a free country.

16:56.754 --> 17:00.715
Only if you're standing on it,
right, Mr. Secretary?

17:00.758 --> 17:03.544
Right.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.417
[door closes]

17:08.984 --> 17:10.812
Can I ask you a question, sir?

17:10.855 --> 17:11.856
What am I doing here?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.206
Yeah.

17:13.249 --> 17:15.599
Helping.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.821
You sure about that?

17:26.175 --> 17:28.351
TONY: Well, she's not military
or law enforcement.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.223
That's good.
Yeah.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.094
Maybe we've found our...

17:32.138 --> 17:34.140
Ooh. Never mind.

17:34.183 --> 17:37.360
BORIN: What?
She's an ordained
New Age High Priestess.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.971
Explains the timeshare
in Sedona.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.843
Yeah.It's Gibbs.

17:44.150 --> 17:47.153
Boss, we've been digging deeper
into our refugee family.

17:47.196 --> 17:50.721
And?Mariam never mentioned
they also had a daughter.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.768
Had?
Yes. Saraya Bawali.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.987
She was killed
during a U.S. bombing raid

17:56.031 --> 17:58.947
on a Hezbollah safe house
in the early 1980s.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.776
Action a lot of Lebanese people
felt was the U.S.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.734
taking sides over the country's
Muslim population.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.780
Does not mean
Mariam feels that way.

18:05.823 --> 18:06.955
Ask her.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.089
We gonna ask her what else
she's lying about?

18:10.132 --> 18:11.786
No. Ziva is.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.575
Why did you lie to me?

18:22.013 --> 18:23.928
There was no crew, Mariam.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.756
You and your family
hid yourselves.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.367
You want help?

18:27.410 --> 18:28.890
You want freedom?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.979
Then stop lying to me.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.111
Let me help you.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.636
Fine. Good-bye.

18:35.679 --> 18:36.941
Wait. Where are you going?

18:36.985 --> 18:39.292
I'm not going anywhere,
but you and your family,

18:39.335 --> 18:40.945
you guys are going
back to Lebanon.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.512
Wait!

18:42.556 --> 18:43.992
What do you want to know?

18:44.035 --> 18:47.038
How you got here.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.913
My husband paid the crew,

18:51.956 --> 18:54.568
using our life savings.

18:54.611 --> 18:59.877
They took us out of the port
in Beirut, set the course,

18:59.921 --> 19:02.967
then left the ship
by lifeboats.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.016
Why did one of you shoot
a Coast Guard officer?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.895
I didn't mean to.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.898
You shot him?

19:24.511 --> 19:27.514
We had been followed
by pirates before.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.559
It was night.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.996
I didn't hear the
man on the speaker,

19:32.040 --> 19:33.563
what he was saying.

19:33.607 --> 19:37.915
We had a weapon
for protection.

19:37.959 --> 19:41.919
I saw someone climbing
aboard in darkness.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.530
I fired.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.184
How many shots did you fire?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.881
Three.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.970
How far away were you?

19:49.013 --> 19:52.060
Hmm...

19:55.411 --> 19:57.370
This far.

19:57.413 --> 19:58.980
This far?

20:00.024 --> 20:01.461
Yes.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.027
According to the second officer,

20:03.071 --> 20:05.073
the shooter was
about 60 feet away.

20:05.116 --> 20:09.556
So, you weren't
even there, were you?

20:15.388 --> 20:18.129
I'm sorry.

20:18.173 --> 20:21.785
You do not know who shot him.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.659
No.

20:38.149 --> 20:44.243
You are a good mother,
Mariam, but a really bad liar.

20:47.942 --> 20:53.208
You cannot control the truth
about your family,

20:53.252 --> 20:56.646
no matter how much
that truth may hurt.

21:02.652 --> 21:07.309
Well, boys, our evidence shows
your mom pulled the trigger.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.964
Our mother did not
shoot anyone!

21:10.007 --> 21:11.357
That's not what she said.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.968
If she confessed, then you
forced it out of her!

21:14.011 --> 21:15.883
Doesn't matter how
we got her to say it,

21:15.926 --> 21:17.580
point is, she said it.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.104
How dare you intimidate
our mother, you bitch!

21:20.148 --> 21:23.151
[grunting]

21:23.194 --> 21:24.718
You want to see
intimidation, bitch?

21:24.761 --> 21:25.719
[grunts]

21:25.762 --> 21:27.242
My brother means no ill will.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.853
He's got an odd way
of showing it.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.116
[growls]

21:32.160 --> 21:33.030
[grunts]

21:36.120 --> 21:38.209
We must respect our mother.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.871
Whatever she told you
is the truth.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.264
You're willing
to let your mother

21:49.308 --> 21:51.310
take the blame for a murder?

21:59.274 --> 22:02.059
No.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.235
You're never gonna find
the perfect woman for Gibbs.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.367
How do you know?

22:05.411 --> 22:06.977
'Cause he's already found her.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.849
His first wife.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.198
Yeah.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.592
Well, doesn't mean we
can't still try, right?

22:12.635 --> 22:13.984
It's futile.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.421
Kind of like our background
checks on the refugees.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.597
If there was something to find,
we would have found it.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.250
[computer beeping]

22:20.817 --> 22:22.123
Oh, found more,

22:22.166 --> 22:23.603
oh ye of little
algorithmic faith.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.387
Duly chastised.
Hit me, Timmy.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.042
Got a facial-recognition match
on the father.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.784
It's a photo in
the Homeland Security database

22:30.827 --> 22:32.220
from 27 years ago.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.700
He was going by
a different name.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.092
Lateef Issam.

22:37.051 --> 22:40.402
Wanted in connection
to a 1984 bombing in Lebanon.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.013
Coffee shop frequented
by U.S. servicemen.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.058
CIA could never
find him.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.189
Call Gibbs.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.410
It's going
straight to voice mail.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.107
[dialing]

22:51.152 --> 22:52.458
Same with Tony.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.547
Signal in the
ship was wonky.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.593
[line ringing]

22:57.637 --> 22:58.812
Hey, Abby.

22:58.855 --> 22:59.987
ABBY:
Where's Farid?

23:00.030 --> 23:01.075
Tony's with him below deck. Why?

23:01.118 --> 23:02.598
He's not who he says he is.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.121
You need to get to him quickly.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.993
TONY:
Since you let
your wife do the shooting,

23:06.036 --> 23:08.169
you ought to think about
letting her do the cooking, too.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.301
Smells like a Bath &
Body Works in here.

23:10.345 --> 23:13.392
This is our laundry water.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.959
And I already told you,
I know nothing about the murder.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.091
ZIVA:
Tony!

23:26.361 --> 23:28.232
Stop, Farid!

23:28.276 --> 23:29.320
Stop!

23:46.512 --> 23:48.209
Freeze!

23:54.694 --> 23:56.522
TONY:
Sure you want to jump?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.046
Lead might weigh you down.

23:59.089 --> 24:00.961
Cannot run away from
your past, Lateef.

24:01.004 --> 24:02.441
It always catches up.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.706
What has happened?

24:06.749 --> 24:08.534
[handcuffs clicking]

24:08.577 --> 24:10.579
The truth happened.

24:17.499 --> 24:20.459
What part of
"keep everybody on the ship"

24:20.502 --> 24:21.938
did you not understand?

24:21.982 --> 24:23.287
He's a wanted
terrorist, Leon.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.288
I arrested him.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.855
You could have called first.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.640
But you knew I'd have you
stand down, isn't that right?

24:27.683 --> 24:28.641
Yeah, pretty much.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.556
Director,

24:30.599 --> 24:33.384
I think Special Agent Gibbs
made a valid command decision

24:33.428 --> 24:36.300
that, while of questionable
wisdom, was absent of malice.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.345
Isn't that right,
Agent Gibbs?

24:37.388 --> 24:38.564
See?

24:38.607 --> 24:39.869
All better.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.308
I'll go call
the State Department,

24:44.352 --> 24:46.920
explain to them why we chose
to ignore their directive.

24:46.963 --> 24:47.964
I'll do it.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.879
You two get ready
to break this guy.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.794
Unless you want me
to referee that, too?

24:53.404 --> 24:55.406
No, sir.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.975
Bump in the road, Leon.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.324
It happens.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.370
Depends on who's driving, right?

25:02.413 --> 25:04.198
Who is driving, sir?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.946
I cannot believe Mariam
would lie to protect this man.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.730
Well, maybe she lied
to protect herself.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.169
Speaking of liars, father Farid
was in the Lebanese army.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.910
Meaning he knows how
to handle a firearm.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.869
I've got my guys pulling
everything they can on him.

25:22.912 --> 25:25.698
You find your
Gibbs girl yet?

25:25.741 --> 25:26.873
I think so.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.527
Lisa Cridansky.

25:28.570 --> 25:29.571
Lisa's perfect.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.920
I just saw her
last week.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.922
She's a hiking partner,
stamina of a horse.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.839
She dyed.

25:36.883 --> 25:37.579
What?

25:37.623 --> 25:39.233
Her hair.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.974
In all the pictures online,
she's blonde.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.366
In yours,
she's a redhead.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.803
Yeah, but this is
her natural hair color. So what?

25:43.846 --> 25:45.848
Eh, we were willing
to risk it with you,

25:45.892 --> 25:47.720
but it's not
a good idea generally.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.025
Tony, don't take this
the wrong way,

25:49.069 --> 25:50.592
but you smell like
the hot cheerleader

25:50.636 --> 25:51.811
in my high school homeroom.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.030
Is that White Diamonds, DiNozzo?

25:54.074 --> 25:55.597
[groans]

25:55.641 --> 25:57.991
Farid spilled his laundry
detergent all over the place.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.601
I got some
on my pants.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.603
I must have, must
have missed a spot.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.606
Is that it?

26:04.650 --> 26:06.042
BORIN:
No, a little higher.

26:06.086 --> 26:07.261
T-To your right.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.916
You do it.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.179
Bend over, DiNozzo.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.009
Oh, that's really
on there.

26:16.052 --> 26:16.923
Can't get that off.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.141
I'm gonna call Abby to see

26:18.185 --> 26:19.621
if she's got something
to remove that.

26:20.840 --> 26:21.797
[sputters]

26:21.841 --> 26:24.234
Special Agents
Borin and DiNozzo.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.064
Please stop doing
whatever it is you're doing.

26:28.108 --> 26:30.937
We were just, uh...

26:30.980 --> 26:32.895
reexamining that
very special bond

26:32.939 --> 26:35.506
between the Navy and
the Coast Guard, sir.

26:36.551 --> 26:38.379
Agent David, back to the ship.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.033
Make sure nobody
else gets off.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.251
Agent Borin,

26:41.295 --> 26:42.905
have your people
put together an escort team.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.690
This cargo vessel is being
refueled as we speak

26:44.733 --> 26:46.169
to take the family
back to Lebanon.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.606
What about the father?

26:47.649 --> 26:49.085
He's not going anywhere.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.703
Do you recognize him?

27:00.053 --> 27:02.185
Your DNA was found
at the crime scene.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.102
Testing has come a
long way in 30 years.

27:09.366 --> 27:12.456
Do you know how many
people died that day?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.154
People die every day.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.330
It doesn't mean I killed them.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.594
Smug son of a bitch.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.816
Space invader.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.034
It's a nice move.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.166
I'm gonna use that.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.041
I'm not your family.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.174
So don't lie to me.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.004
You're not protesting
your government,

27:38.047 --> 27:39.832
you're protesting mine.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.050
With bombs.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.707
Someone finally
closing in on you?

27:45.751 --> 27:48.318
Forcing you
to run here?

27:52.148 --> 27:53.759
I'm a different man now.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.195
Are you sure
about that?

27:55.238 --> 27:57.458
You sure you're just not
holding a grudge still?

27:57.501 --> 27:59.068
About what?Your daughter.

27:59.112 --> 28:01.070
You blame us
for killing her, right?

28:01.114 --> 28:02.115
You did kill her.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.594
So that's why you
came here, then.

28:03.638 --> 28:04.857
Revenge, right?

28:04.900 --> 28:07.598
I came here
to protect my family.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.862
When you killed
that six-year-old girl

28:09.905 --> 28:11.907
and her three-year-old brother
at that cafe,

28:11.951 --> 28:15.868
did you ever
think about their family?

28:15.911 --> 28:19.132
I want my family to be free.

28:19.175 --> 28:22.135
I want whoever killed

28:22.178 --> 28:25.616
the United States Coast Guard
petty officer.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.401
And that's for starters.

28:27.444 --> 28:32.101
Why do you care so much
about the death of one man?

28:33.537 --> 28:35.801
Just hold on a second.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.196
I'll hold your coffee.

28:50.293 --> 28:52.513
You have the wrong man, Ziva.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.210
No, you have the wrong man.

28:54.254 --> 28:57.300
This journey to
freedom is nothing

28:57.344 --> 28:59.346
but a way for him to
enter this country

28:59.389 --> 29:01.348
by using you
and your sons.

29:01.391 --> 29:04.264
I have lived with him
for 30 years.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.613
I love him.

29:05.656 --> 29:07.180
Nothing changes that.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.183
This...

29:10.226 --> 29:11.053
No.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.054
This changes it.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.664
No. I don't believe it.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.231
Then you are
lying to yourself!

29:15.275 --> 29:17.407
I mean, you have to know
the truth, deep down!

29:17.451 --> 29:19.540
I mean, you must!

29:19.583 --> 29:24.153
Yet you allow him
to lie to you.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.546
To your children.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.853
I'm protecting my children.

29:27.896 --> 29:31.073
They will resent
you for it, Mariam.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.170
Perhaps I had suspicions.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.611
But have you never
turned a blind eye

29:47.655 --> 29:49.309
on someone you loved?

29:51.354 --> 29:53.835
Yes.

29:53.879 --> 29:57.839
And it was a mistake.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.319
I do not intimidate.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.276
BORIN:
Guess what.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.845
Post-9/11,

30:03.889 --> 30:06.239
the Coast Guard works
for Homeland Security.

30:06.282 --> 30:10.112
Which means we can yank your
family off that boat right now.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.853
But they're not
going to America.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.161
They're headed to Gitmo.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.819
What are you proposing?

30:20.862 --> 30:22.124
Confess.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.781
And your family can turn
state's evidence against you.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.217
I cannot confess.

30:28.261 --> 30:29.262
Why?

30:29.305 --> 30:31.177
Because I did not
shoot anyone!

30:33.222 --> 30:34.484
It was my son.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.225
Rafiq.

30:36.269 --> 30:38.314
He killed
the Coast Guard officer.

30:40.360 --> 30:42.275
He refuses
to listen to me.

30:43.929 --> 30:47.193
I do not know
what he's capable of anymore.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.721
That seem too easy to you?

30:53.764 --> 30:55.157
Only one way
to find out.

30:55.201 --> 30:56.811
Interrogate the kid.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.682
On the ship.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.162
Are we clear?

31:00.206 --> 31:01.860
Yes, sir.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.214
[sniffs]

31:08.257 --> 31:10.520
That's not
laundry detergent.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.392
Tony, take
your pants off.

31:12.435 --> 31:13.349
What?

31:13.393 --> 31:16.222
Just take your pants off now.

31:16.265 --> 31:17.397
All right.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.051
Easy, now.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.922
Let's keep it
professional, people.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.272
Move along.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.665
Girl's always looking at me.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.449
[grunting]

31:31.411 --> 31:33.326
Think you can
get it out?

31:33.369 --> 31:34.544
Yep.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.200
Maybe I should have
been more specific.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.376
I'll explain later.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.421
I hope.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.336
Abby will explain later,
she hopes.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.598
Ziva's not answering.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.252
Must be below deck
with our shooter.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.470
Call base security, McGee.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.950
Come on.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.343
DiNozzo, put your pants on.

31:52.606 --> 31:56.915
What will happen to us
now that you have my husband?

31:56.958 --> 31:58.394
Depends if he
cooperates.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.964
[thud, man grunts in distance]

32:07.751 --> 32:09.144
Stay!

32:17.022 --> 32:18.371
[sighs]

32:18.414 --> 32:20.677
It's locked,
from the other side.

32:20.721 --> 32:23.071
Why would your people do that?

32:23.115 --> 32:26.074
It was not my people.

32:41.002 --> 32:44.788
[clattering]

32:48.096 --> 32:49.619
What are you looking for?

32:49.663 --> 32:51.839
Another way out.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.241
[phone ringing]

33:02.284 --> 33:04.199
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.201
Gibbs, put me on speaker.

33:06.245 --> 33:09.030
Why, Abbs?Because you're all in danger.
Everyone needs to hear this.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.205
McGee, put it on speaker.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.903
Yeah, Abbs, you're on.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.557
It's a trap.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.038
You're headed straight into
a massive terrorist plot.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.694
That residue on Tony's pants?
It was pure glycerin.

33:20.737 --> 33:23.392
Distilled from perfumed soap.Glycerin?
As in nitroglycerin?

33:23.436 --> 33:24.654
Of course.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.178
Fight Club.
Fincher. Pitt. Soap.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.396
Stuff blows up.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.745
Yes, combining glycerin

33:28.789 --> 33:30.399
plus small amounts
of drain cleaner

33:30.443 --> 33:32.271
and rust remover
also found on the ship.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.578
Which contain sulfuric acid,
nitric acid and phenol.

33:35.622 --> 33:38.016
You add those four together,
and you get TNP.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.061
It's an old-school gunpowder

33:40.105 --> 33:41.932
used in World War I
artillery shells.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.673
Can't be a very big bomb.

33:43.717 --> 33:44.805
That's just the detonator.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.982
The bomb is the 30,000 gallons
of fuel

33:48.026 --> 33:50.071
that we just put
in the ship's gas tank.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.595
And that's not the bad part.Get to the bad part.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.249
Our ship in Norfolk

33:54.293 --> 33:57.774
is docked near two destroyers,
a carrier and three frigates.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.428
And they're all
loaded down with munitions

33:59.472 --> 34:00.777
for deployment
to the Middle East.

34:00.821 --> 34:02.779
This blast and its
chain reaction

34:02.823 --> 34:04.651
could take out half
the Norfolk Naval Base.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.393
[engine revving]

34:15.836 --> 34:17.533
Are you okay?

34:19.013 --> 34:20.536
[knocking]

34:26.629 --> 34:28.675
What's going on?

34:30.372 --> 34:32.635
Gibbs, it's one
of the sons.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.115
Rafiq.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.508
Impossible.

34:35.551 --> 34:36.552
Gets worse.

34:36.596 --> 34:37.814
[clanking]

34:39.512 --> 34:41.296
[muffled yelling]

34:42.428 --> 34:45.039
GIBBS:
NCIS! Don't move!

34:45.083 --> 34:46.997
[muffled yell]

34:51.350 --> 34:52.351
Rafiq?

34:53.917 --> 34:55.528
Hey, the bomb.
Where is the bomb?

34:55.571 --> 34:56.877
A bomb?

34:56.920 --> 34:58.531
Hakim hit me.
I woke up here.

34:58.574 --> 35:02.404
Okay, why would a father lie
about which son is the bad one?

35:02.448 --> 35:04.928
So we'd leave the good one
alone on the ship.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.974
No! No son of mine
could do this!

35:07.017 --> 35:09.716
Mother, it was Hakim!
He had a gun.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.848
I saw him attack
one of the guards.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.546
I tried to stop him,
but he attacked me.

35:13.589 --> 35:15.983
Open your eyes!TONY:
Topside's clear, boss.

35:16.026 --> 35:18.333
McGee's coordinating a full evac
with Naval Security, but...

35:18.377 --> 35:20.814
[pneumatic drill whirring]

35:25.819 --> 35:28.474
Okay, it's coming from
below and astern.

35:28.517 --> 35:29.866
That's the engine room.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.041
Get them off the ship now.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.826
Come on, let's go.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.349
Come on.
Wait.

35:34.393 --> 35:36.917
I cannot turn a
blind eye anymore.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.006
Mariam, it is too late.

35:39.049 --> 35:42.575
No, there is still a chance for
me to do right by my children.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.198
BORIN:
Put down the wires, Hakim.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.157
GIBBS:
Hey, slowly.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.858
MARIAM:
Hakim?

36:06.903 --> 36:08.862
Mother...

36:08.905 --> 36:11.865
I can see it with
my own eyes.

36:11.908 --> 36:15.303
Yet I cannot believe this
is what you have become.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.739
Not my son.

36:16.783 --> 36:19.046
Go away!

36:19.089 --> 36:23.093
Do you want to be
like your father?

36:23.137 --> 36:26.575
He was the only one
who ever made sense of
the violence back home.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.664
He told me who is responsible.

36:30.057 --> 36:32.059
And taught me to fight back.

36:32.102 --> 36:35.018
MARIAM:
He taught you to kill?

36:35.062 --> 36:37.282
The officer?

36:37.325 --> 36:39.240
Father shot
the American officer.

36:39.284 --> 36:42.374
Otherwise they would not have
brought the ship into port.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.984
Kept it here.

36:44.027 --> 36:47.030
But now Father is gone.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.990
So I must finish
what we started.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.557
MARIAM:
Why?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.994
Saraya!

36:54.037 --> 36:57.824
What they did to her!

36:57.867 --> 37:01.262
Hakim, that was
so very long ago.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.133
She was my sister!

37:03.177 --> 37:07.050
She was my daughter!

37:07.094 --> 37:09.836
A daughter who I'll never
get to watch grow.

37:09.879 --> 37:13.927
A daughter who will never
experience her mother's love!

37:13.970 --> 37:16.277
My love!

37:16.321 --> 37:19.541
You and your father are not
the only ones who hurt!

37:22.109 --> 37:27.027
But despite my grief,
I still tried to teach you

37:27.070 --> 37:31.858
understanding,
forgiveness, Hakim, love.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.599
Love.

37:36.254 --> 37:40.519
How can you forgive those
who deserve to be punished?

37:40.562 --> 37:44.523
Because this punishment does not
accomplish anything, Hakim.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.960
It will just take away
another child

37:47.003 --> 37:49.963
from another mother
who loves him.

37:58.972 --> 38:01.017
[sobbing]

38:02.932 --> 38:05.979
[speaking Arabic]

38:06.022 --> 38:08.721
Son, do not leave me.

38:23.649 --> 38:24.954
Mother!

38:27.348 --> 38:29.219
I'm so sorry.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.963
I'm sorry.

38:56.203 --> 38:59.075
VANCE:
The State Department
and the Lebanese government

38:59.119 --> 39:00.729
have denied any claim to Farid.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.644
They want him to pay
for what he's done.

39:02.688 --> 39:04.167
The family?

39:04.211 --> 39:06.518
Mariam and Rafiq will be
granted temporary visas.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.215
Hakim's agreed
to give us information

39:08.258 --> 39:10.304
about his father's contacts.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.219
Nicely handled, Director.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.700
I'm not so sure
it was, Clayton.

39:14.743 --> 39:18.094
Are we talking as friends now?

39:18.138 --> 39:19.531
Yeah.

39:19.574 --> 39:23.099
We've known each other
for a long time.

39:23.143 --> 39:24.623
Is there anything
I can do for you?

39:24.666 --> 39:26.625
I don't follow.To make this easier--

39:26.668 --> 39:28.191
your transition into this job.

39:30.019 --> 39:32.021
You and Gibbs think
I'm in over my head?

39:32.065 --> 39:33.675
You think I'm
overcompensating?

39:33.719 --> 39:36.678
I think you're having trouble
letting go of bad habits.

39:36.722 --> 39:39.638
This isn't my
first rodeo, Leon.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.248
Gibbs isn't
my first cowboy.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.423
I'm fine.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.469
Okay.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.386
But if I wasn't...

39:48.429 --> 39:50.562
You can always come to me
as a friend, Clayton.

39:53.086 --> 39:55.218
No need.

40:01.224 --> 40:02.530
Perfect.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.445
She's even
a Le Cordon Bleu chef.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.230
TONY: Is it possible we've done
something right for Gibbs?

40:07.274 --> 40:09.929
What if it upsets
the space-time continuum

40:09.972 --> 40:12.148
and sends the Earth
hurtling towards the sun?

40:13.976 --> 40:16.152
What's she doing up there?

40:19.678 --> 40:21.419
Boss, we found the
perfect woman for you.

40:21.462 --> 40:24.030
And we would like you
to ask her out.Who?

40:24.073 --> 40:25.510
Dusty?

40:25.553 --> 40:28.034
Nice lady.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.602
Great cook.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.908
Did you read
that on the screen?

40:32.952 --> 40:35.389
No. I dated her.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.088
So, what was wrong
with her, boss?

40:39.132 --> 40:40.046
Nothing.

40:40.089 --> 40:42.004
She's perfect.Perfect?

40:42.048 --> 40:43.266
What happened?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.051
There's nothing more
boring than perfect.

40:45.094 --> 40:46.269
[chuckles]

40:46.313 --> 40:48.271
[laughing]

40:48.315 --> 40:50.448
Go-go-go home.

40:50.491 --> 40:52.711
Keep your phones on.

41:02.111 --> 41:04.287
Your team thinks
you're lonely.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.509
So, you lonely, Gibbs?

41:08.553 --> 41:10.729
Nope.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.472
[phone ringing]

41:16.125 --> 41:17.300
Borin.

41:18.780 --> 41:21.130
I'll be right there.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.741
Duty calls.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.612
But, Gibbs,

41:24.656 --> 41:25.918
it has been fun.

41:36.406 --> 41:38.191
Ziva...

41:39.758 --> 41:41.324
Sometimes people do
the wrong things

41:41.368 --> 41:43.109
for the right reasons.

41:43.152 --> 41:46.504
People always think their
own reasons are right.

41:46.547 --> 41:47.592
Especially parents.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.550
They got perspective.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.291
Parents still make mistakes.

41:51.334 --> 41:52.640
Yeah.

41:54.903 --> 41:59.604
My... mother...

41:59.647 --> 42:06.698
never told me what kind
of a... man my father was.

42:09.048 --> 42:11.267
Perhaps she thought I was not

42:11.311 --> 42:13.443
strong enough to handle it.

42:13.487 --> 42:16.185
Nah, she was just being a mom.

42:16.229 --> 42:18.100
How do you know?

42:18.144 --> 42:20.233
Perspective.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.063
Are you lonely, Gibbs?

42:28.807 --> 42:31.157
You're never alone
when you have kids.

42:33.855 --> 42:35.161
Night, kid.
