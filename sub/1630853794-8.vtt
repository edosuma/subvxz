-Or do I let it go and... and
buy another pasta maker?

from all of med school.

not to talk to strangers.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.123
Yeah, well, they're...

10:24.206 --> 10:27.043
gone now, so you can trust me.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.295
I don't trust clowns
with secrets.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.547
I am barely
clown-themed anymore,

10:31.630 --> 10:33.507
I just think
I look hot like this.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.886
I mean, check how good
these bootie shorts
make my ass look, right?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.763
Never mind, you're eight, okay.
[chuckles]

10:38.846 --> 10:40.306
I just wanna go home.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.141
Hey, let's make a deal:

10:42.224 --> 10:46.479
if I help you get back home,
will you show me
where my friend is?

10:46.562 --> 10:49.357
There we go.
See? I'm not a clown,

10:49.440 --> 10:50.524
I'm a friend.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.572
[bats chittering]

10:56.655 --> 10:58.741
[unnerving music playing]

11:00.493 --> 11:04.205
Hey, look. It's you.
We must have found
your memories.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.415
Why do we fall down,
Master Bruce?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.417
To pick ourselves up?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.669
Yes. That's what
I was going to say.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.589
Aww, look at you,
you little Grumpy Gus.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.883
[Little Bruce] Yeah, that was
at my parents' funeral.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.343
Oh.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.388
[bats squeaking]

11:20.471 --> 11:21.931
[dramatic music playing]

11:22.014 --> 11:23.849
Ugh! Always a white billionaire

11:23.933 --> 11:27.269
coming to a group
of Himalayan monk-ninjas
and forcing them to train him.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.605
What a dickhead.
Oh, no offense.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.734
[Bruce] As a man,
I'm flesh and blood.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.070
I can be ignored.
I can be destroyed.

11:36.153 --> 11:39.949
But as a symbol,
as a really cool, very gritty,
super-serious symbol,

11:40.032 --> 11:43.285
I can be incorruptible,
I can be everlasting.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.372
You know, you grow up
to have a real savior complex.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.706
Who do you think you are?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.125
You don't sound like
Bruce Wayne there.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.210
You sound like-- [gasps]

11:51.293 --> 11:53.629
Holy shit. You're...

11:53.712 --> 11:56.507
-I'm Batman.
-[Batman theme plays]

11:56.590 --> 11:57.466
[gasps]

12:01.762 --> 12:03.139
Hmm. [tuts]

12:03.222 --> 12:07.101
Alfred! Are the ears too big?
I think they're too big.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.561
How could Bruce be Batman?

12:08.644 --> 12:10.229
I mean, sure,
he's the richest man in Gotham,

12:10.312 --> 12:12.148
so that explains
all the vehicles.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.858
And he's always
going missing at big galas
when villains show up.

12:13.941 --> 12:16.318
Okay, come to think of it,
it's very obvious.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.487
Wait till you hear
who Superman is.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.574
Come on!

12:21.657 --> 12:23.909
Okay, I'm not comfortable
with whatever this is.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.870
Look, Harley likes it
when I play with her hair.

12:25.953 --> 12:29.582
I don't know.
I'm just... At least
I'm trying something, right?

12:29.665 --> 12:31.792
And not just playing
video games
in the goddamn corner.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.921
How dare you? Look, video games
are how I deal with stress.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.841
If I stop playing,
I'll start thinking,

12:38.924 --> 12:40.217
and if I start thinking,

12:40.301 --> 12:44.054
I will freak the-- [gasping]

12:44.138 --> 12:48.267
I cannot take this stress
right now.
I will be in my kingdom.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.770
What the hell was that?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.524
[dramatic music playing]

12:56.692 --> 12:58.652
[sirens wailing]

13:02.448 --> 13:03.949
I had a few weird years.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.164
I always thought Batman
was a stick in the mud,

13:10.247 --> 13:12.291
but seeing everything
you've done

13:12.374 --> 13:16.212
all shmushed together like that
is impressive.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.672
And honestly, kinda inspiring.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.300
But, you know, if you truly
wanted to help Gotham,

13:21.383 --> 13:23.802
why not start
with affordable housing?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.471
People pay for housing?

[yelps]

13:37.858 --> 13:39.443
[Harley screaming]

13:42.696 --> 13:44.657
Holy sanitized curse word!

13:44.740 --> 13:46.784
[Joker chuckling] Oh, how cute.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.245
The songbird's afraid to swear.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.164
Ugh, you used to be
such a fudging pill.

13:52.831 --> 13:53.791
Wait.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.001
Firework rocket, tied-up Robin,

13:56.085 --> 13:58.045
smell of fried Oreos and vomit.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.630
Oh, I remember this night!

13:59.713 --> 14:02.466
What should we do with Batsie's
little sidekick, puddin'?

14:02.550 --> 14:04.426
Oh, no!

14:04.510 --> 14:08.180
I think we oughta teach him
some manners, Mistah J.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.098
Ugh.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.599
She's just so beautiful.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.018
God! You put your tongue
in that?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.645
Psycho, if you aren't here
to help Harley,

14:14.728 --> 14:16.981
you need to get out
of the goddamn house.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.149
Well, I'm starting to feel
not welcome here,

14:19.233 --> 14:20.276
so fine by me.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.362
[both groan]

14:24.655 --> 14:26.615
Huzzah! We saved the movie!

14:26.699 --> 14:29.743
We can CGI
the moustache in post.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.996
[sniffs] That's not good.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.622

-[Joker chuckles]

14:38.085 --> 14:39.336
You're disgusting.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.796
All this destruction
and mayhem for what?

14:40.879 --> 14:42.172
Do you really like that?

14:42.256 --> 14:45.884
Mr. J likes it.
Whatever he likes, I like.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.345
Ugh! And the accent,
oh, my God, so heavy.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.972
Girl, ease it down.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.851
-Who do you think you are?
-Not you. Not anymore.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.728
I think Robin's lost
his marbles.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.313
Someday you'll get
with the love of your life,

14:57.396 --> 14:59.481
and you'll see how foolish
you been all those years.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.151
Too bad you'll miss
the wedding.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.070
We haven't talked
about marriage yet!

15:05.154 --> 15:06.488
[whooshing]

15:06.572 --> 15:08.574
[Batman theme plays]

15:08.657 --> 15:11.035
Put me down for the fish.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.163
You're not supposed
to order the fish.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.291
They just put it on the menu
to not seem cheap.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.460

Ugh. Get a room.
And some self-esteem.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.479
[all grunting]

15:40.314 --> 15:43.651
Ahh! My ear!
Oh, my God, that is so cruel.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.738
[Joker laughs]

15:47.821 --> 15:50.574
Hey, you never told me
stopping baddies
was this much fun.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.201
Being a hero's supposed
to be lame.

[both grunt]

15:53.452 --> 15:54.745
-It has its moments.
-[ding]

15:54.828 --> 15:56.205
Costume looks good
on you, Quinn.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.332
You don't think the shorts
are too short?

15:58.415 --> 16:00.000

a little something,
but come on, this is a thong.

-I say we skip

stress-disorder Batman!

He's trying to taint
your memories.

[grunts]

16:42.501 --> 16:44.086
[gasps]

16:44.169 --> 16:47.089
Do I have
your verbal consent to become
your licensed therapist?

16:47.172 --> 16:49.758
I'm gonna take that as a yes,
so you can't ever sue me.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.140
Don't think about him.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.851
Close your eyes,
cross your hands like this.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.978
You're doing great.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.647
Now think about somewhere
you feel safe.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.483
A memory where you felt
truly happy.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.943
No criminals.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.111
No bats.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.487
Just happy.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.323
There you go.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.117
Now check in with your senses.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.328
Think about
what you're smelling.
What you're hearing.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.789
What you're feeling.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.460
Incredible first session.
Will you be paying this
co-pay now or later?

17:24.543 --> 17:27.296
Yeah, rich people insurance
doesn't have co-pays.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.506
Ahh, this country's
so fucked up.

[festive music playing]

17:40.893 --> 17:42.352
This is your safe space, huh?

17:42.436 --> 17:45.981
It's the last Christmas
we had together. Before...

17:46.064 --> 17:47.274
Those are for Santa.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.109
Ah, I'll take the heat
from Tim Allen.

[popping]

17:58.452 --> 18:00.454
[sinister music playing]

18:03.707 --> 18:05.918
In here.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.712
Well, kid, unless you have
your utility belt under there,

18:08.796 --> 18:10.464
I don't think
we're getting out of this one.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.673
I was wrong.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.176
You're not scary
like that other clown.

18:14.259 --> 18:18.347
I don't wanna lie anymore.
I stole your friend. It was me.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.057
Frank? Yeah, I know.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.936
He's the key.
He's the one who'll make
the bad man disappear.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.854
Whoa, slow down.
What do you mean?

18:25.938 --> 18:29.399
I took him first
'cause I saw Ivy was up to
no good on the cameras.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.985
You could see us on Cat Woman's
security cameras.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.570
Ew. You were perving?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.697
No, I was being a hero.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.199
I had to stop your plan.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.785
But then I realized
that the plant could do more.

18:39.868 --> 18:44.039
It could bring mommies
and daddies back from the dead.
It'll fix everything.

18:44.122 --> 18:47.876
Frank resurrects plants,
he can't bring back people.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.087
He can now. I changed him.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.089
-How?
-Science?

18:53.048 --> 18:53.924
[door opens]

18:59.638 --> 19:01.390
You don't have to be afraid
of him, Bruce.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.268
He is just another
masked asshole
in a city full of 'em.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.854
Too afraid to even
show his face.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.272
[thunder crashes]

19:10.983 --> 19:15.737
Okay, I've got, like,
a million questions.
But mostly, what?

19:15.821 --> 19:17.322
He didn't tell you
why I'm here?

19:17.406 --> 19:20.033
The reason I sit all night
by the window waiting,

19:20.117 --> 19:22.035
begging for the Bat-Signal
to appear.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.537
The reason I became Batman.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.414
Everyone knows
your parents were murdered.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.083
It's pretty well-worn territory
at this point.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.085
But they don't know
that it was my fault.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.754
That night, Father
wanted me to attend
a shareholders meeting,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.465
but I begged he take us
to the movies,

19:35.549 --> 19:37.050
The Mark of Zorro.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.261
I came out of that theater
exhilarated, inspired, even.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.930
So much so I refused
to take the limo back.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.308
I wanted us to walk home.
Through Crime Alley.

19:44.391 --> 19:48.103
To think all this trauma
from an Antonio Banderas film.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.771
No, that's the '90s one,

19:49.855 --> 19:51.607
I'm talking about
the black and white--
It doesn't matter.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.235
Everything I do as Batman is
to make that one night right.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.862
Yet it's never enough,

19:56.945 --> 19:58.739
so I must never forget.

19:58.822 --> 20:02.117
That is my penance.
My bat-shaped cross to bear.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.036
Moving on
doesn't mean forgetting.

20:04.119 --> 20:08.957
It means healing.
And as your therapist,
I promised to help you heal.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.002
Either you give up the kid
so he can return
to Crime Alley,

20:12.085 --> 20:14.338
or I shoot you dead.
Your call, Quinn.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.298
I thought your rule
was no guns.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.509
I mean, the real me
is against it,
but the mind me is flexible.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.512
Help me.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.513
I will.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.265
But I can't help you in here.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.018
I need to talk to the real you,
it's too fucked up in here.

20:28.101 --> 20:31.063
Come on, champ.
Let's go watch our parents die.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.314
It's what we deserve.

20:32.397 --> 20:35.192
Like I said, very fucked up.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.277
Don't tell my secret.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.571
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

No.

Wayne hired those fucking

to do his dirty work.

Didn't even realize Batman
was such a fucking sell-out.

you can't undo your trauma.

It's not possible!
