01:04.030 --> 01:06.671
More lesbian sex, I want more lesbian.

01:06.672 --> 01:10.684
You're the one that told me
lesbians are always sleeping with their friends.

01:10.685 --> 01:12.717
So let's see it!

01:12.718 --> 01:14.493
See them hook up!

01:15.100 --> 01:16.604
For example.

01:17.312 --> 01:21.525
Page 31, scene 43.

01:21.526 --> 01:24.150
I think we're missing an opportunity here.
I think

01:24.151 --> 01:27.609
Bev and this make-up artist
should totally hook up.

01:27.610 --> 01:30.064
- That would never happen.
- Think about it.

01:30.096 --> 01:32.190
<i>I mean, just because
it didn't happen in real life,</i>

01:32.192 --> 01:34.046
<i>it doesn't mean
it can't happen in the movies.</i>

01:34.071 --> 01:36.443
<i>This is Hollywood.
We can do whatever the hell we want.</i>

01:36.440 --> 01:37.846
You think to be forgetting

01:37.849 --> 01:40.051
that Bev and Nina are together.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.761
<i>She cheats with the plumber.</i>

01:41.807 --> 01:44.900
<i>I like the idea
of Bev as the serial cheater.</i>

01:44.907 --> 01:48.233
<i>It undermines the significance
of her affair with the plumber.</i>

01:50.075 --> 01:53.061
<i>Now, this might be crazy,
but what about Nina and Shaun?</i>

01:54.736 --> 01:56.391
<i>No!</i>
No.

01:56.398 --> 01:59.560
<i>Nobody's ever wants
to see Nina having sex.</i>

01:59.567 --> 02:02.912
- No one will ever go to the film!
- It's not about what people want to see!

02:02.915 --> 02:05.983
It's about the fact
that Nina is too loyal to cheat.

02:05.985 --> 02:07.763
It goes against her nature.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.889
<i>I like the idea of Bev's the cheater.</i>

02:09.898 --> 02:13.742
<i>I don't see her with Shaun.
What about Bev and Ellen?</i>

02:13.747 --> 02:17.190
<i>- Now, that's hot. I like it.
- That would never happen.</i>

02:17.196 --> 02:18.760
<i>They're too much alike.</i>

02:18.767 --> 02:22.270
<i>Okay, but they're not
having a relationship, Tina.</i>

02:22.275 --> 02:25.243
<i>- They're just fucking.
- Well, I don't buy it.</i>

02:25.256 --> 02:27.510
Well, nobody cares what you buy, okay?

03:31.786 --> 03:34.203
Yeah, I know
he's financing your movie, honey.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.153
I would love to. I know.

03:36.155 --> 03:38.363
I would be more than happy
to work on the film.

03:39.405 --> 03:41.980
Alright, let's see how Tina goes
and...

03:42.566 --> 03:45.142
{\a6}and I'll give her a call,
or you ask her.

03:47.615 --> 03:49.633
- "Gatecrasher" by Ping Pong Bitches -

04:12.007 --> 04:14.163
- Hi, I'm Shane.
- Oh, of course!

04:14.165 --> 04:16.180
- We've been expecting you. Come on in.
- Thank you.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.769
- Thanks for coming on such short notice.
- Sure.

04:20.776 --> 04:24.110
{\a6}Madison's stylist had to flight back east
for some family emergency.

04:24.115 --> 04:25.602
Oh, I'm glad Jenny called me.

04:25.605 --> 04:28.451
{\a6}Well, my husband's really spending
a fortune on her movie.

04:28.915 --> 04:30.181
You uh...

04:30.185 --> 04:33.451
{\a6}- have a very nice place.
- I'm glad you like it.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.133
{\a6}I do.

04:37.557 --> 04:38.790
This way.

04:38.796 --> 04:40.822
Oh, that color is so nice.

04:41.506 --> 04:44.162
How many times do I have
to tell you stop touching your face?

04:44.167 --> 04:46.130
Set up straight.
Shane's here to do your hair.

04:46.145 --> 04:47.140
Shane,

04:47.155 --> 04:50.841
{\a6}- this is Madison, the bride.
- Congratulations. Hi.

04:50.846 --> 04:52.393
Hi, Shane.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.900
{\a6}And that's Abigail, her sister
and maid of honor.

04:54.907 --> 04:57.421
{\a6}- Hi.
- And Gina, one of the bridesmaids.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.452
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.741
{\a6}The photographer's gonna be here
in two and a half hours. That's enough time?

05:03.745 --> 05:05.421
{\a6}- No, no, I'll be fine.
- Oh, great.

05:05.427 --> 05:07.901
{\a6}'Cause I'm gonna need you to do me
when you're finished with them.

05:07.908 --> 05:08.871
{\a6}No problem.

05:15.007 --> 05:16.551
Who would like to go first?

05:17.327 --> 05:19.051
- "Long As You Love Me"
by Shirley Brown -

05:19.716 --> 05:22.611
- Thanks.
- Hey, do you think Tina's on a date?

05:24.118 --> 05:26.710
- It kinda looks like.
- Yeah.

05:26.718 --> 05:29.812
We took her to
these preschool interviews last week.

05:29.817 --> 05:32.192
She was so impressive.

05:32.225 --> 05:34.331
It amazes me how smart she is.

05:34.338 --> 05:37.423
She's really starting to show
some artistic talents,

05:37.455 --> 05:40.491
- which makes Bette really happy.
- Is Bette an artist?

05:40.496 --> 05:44.381
Oh, no, no. But she's the dean
of CU School of the Arts.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.660
And before that
she was the director of the CAC,

05:46.666 --> 05:49.012
and before that, she was a gallery owner.

05:49.698 --> 05:51.672
So, art is really important to her.

05:51.677 --> 05:53.702
Well, that's an understatement.

05:53.705 --> 05:56.302
It's her life.
When we were looking for donors,

05:56.307 --> 05:59.621
she insisted that he'd be an artist,
and not just any artist.

05:59.628 --> 06:02.030
He had to have made
the Whitney Biennial Art.

06:02.037 --> 06:04.122
It's very typical of Bette.

06:04.137 --> 06:05.951
She sounds neurotic.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.032
Anyway. Not in a bad way.

06:09.037 --> 06:12.461
Anyway, she really wants Angie
to be an artist.

06:12.466 --> 06:16.460
Don't you think that's something
she should let Angelica decide for herself?

06:16.468 --> 06:21.022
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
She wouldn't, never... I mean,

06:21.025 --> 06:22.641
we would

06:23.225 --> 06:26.640
never force her to be anything
that she didn't wanna be.

06:28.015 --> 06:30.362
You're the one that said
that marriage's for losers.

06:30.365 --> 06:33.301
- So, why are you doing it?
- To make daddy happy!

06:33.806 --> 06:35.140
And we'll go just better.

06:35.176 --> 06:37.032
Shane, she cheated with a married man,

06:37.037 --> 06:38.531
besides he was cooing his wife.

06:38.538 --> 06:41.203
- Now, she's bitter!
- Fuck off, Maddie.

06:41.236 --> 06:42.903
I don't know why anyone
would get married. I mean,

06:42.905 --> 06:44.800
look at our parents, they're miserable.

06:45.438 --> 06:46.773
Are you married, Shane?

06:46.775 --> 06:48.182
No.

06:48.186 --> 06:49.911
Do you have a boyfriend?

06:49.916 --> 06:51.013
No.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.192
Do you have a girlfriend?

06:55.725 --> 06:58.500
- Not anymore.
- Then, you like girls.

06:58.867 --> 07:00.233
Yes, I do.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.031
Does that mean you'll never get married?

07:02.037 --> 07:03.831
Gay people aren't allowed to get married,
idiot.

07:03.846 --> 07:06.153
Yeah, I know, but they can still pretend.

07:06.155 --> 07:09.592
Well, I don't think it's for me,
but I admire people who do it.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.503
Despites why they're doing it.

07:12.275 --> 07:14.882
You are so good, Shane.

07:14.886 --> 07:16.871
I wish you could do my hair everyday.

07:16.876 --> 07:18.981
- I bet you do.
- Shut up, Maddie.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.640
Okay, I'm next now.
Do me.

07:26.026 --> 07:28.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:28.238 --> 07:30.372
I think it's just a matter of uh...

07:30.377 --> 07:30.991
- "When Tomorrow Comes"
by The Emotions -

07:31.037 --> 07:34.093
exposing her to all sorts of

07:35.107 --> 07:37.480
expressions, art,

07:37.487 --> 07:39.551
you know, music, all of that.

07:39.557 --> 07:41.181
You know, when the time comes,
she can

07:41.197 --> 07:44.183
make an educated decision
about what she wants to do. Hi.

07:44.188 --> 07:45.932
- Sorry.
- It's okay. Hi.

07:48.545 --> 07:51.391
Denise, this is uh,
this is Bette.

07:52.816 --> 07:54.692
The famous Bette...

07:54.698 --> 07:58.122
- Oh, famous? Did I miss something?
- No, we were just uh...

07:58.158 --> 08:00.690
Tina's just told me a lot about you.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.952
All good stuff.

08:03.807 --> 08:06.271
We were talking about Angelica, actually.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.121
She's really beautiful.

08:08.127 --> 08:09.713
You've met her?

08:09.715 --> 08:11.853
Oh no. Tina showed me a picture.

08:12.787 --> 08:16.201
Well, we're just having lunch over there.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.773
If you feel like you wanna join us.

08:17.806 --> 08:21.763
- No, well, I think we'll stay.
- You know what? Go ahead.

08:21.766 --> 08:24.281
That's okay.
I have to get back to the office anyway.

08:24.285 --> 08:26.220
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

08:26.225 --> 08:28.810
- That was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.

08:28.816 --> 08:30.961
I'll be right over. Okay?

08:34.645 --> 08:37.071
Maybe we can do this another time.

08:37.605 --> 08:40.303
I think you have some things
to figure out.

09:10.255 --> 09:11.962
Share time, ladies.

09:21.387 --> 09:23.202
You know there's stalls in there, right?

09:23.206 --> 09:24.640
They're locked.

09:25.487 --> 09:27.201
- "All Day Preaching" by The Soul Children -

09:31.186 --> 09:32.342
It's weird.

09:50.096 --> 09:53.232
Well, I guess that's what you get
for hanging at The Planet, right?

09:53.238 --> 09:54.872
Right.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.220
- After you.
- No, after you.

09:57.602 --> 09:58.986
Thanks, buddy.

10:00.071 --> 10:01.363
Thank you.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.446
So, how did it go with Denise?

10:04.449 --> 10:06.540
- It was great.
- Really?

10:06.546 --> 10:08.702
Yeah. I think we're

10:08.708 --> 10:10.903
gonna get together again.

10:10.906 --> 10:12.513
That's great, T.

10:12.515 --> 10:14.321
So, what does she do?

10:15.056 --> 10:16.643
Why do you ask that?

10:16.657 --> 10:19.921
- That's a hideous question.
- I'm just curious.

10:19.928 --> 10:21.591
She's a mortgage broker.

10:22.527 --> 10:24.132
Wow, that's so... um...

10:24.137 --> 10:26.630
You know what? It doesn't matter what she does,
because she's cute,

10:26.635 --> 10:29.562
- she's smart... right?
- That's right.

10:29.568 --> 10:31.693
You know,
remember what we talked about.

10:33.565 --> 10:36.102
So is Tasha back for good?

10:36.107 --> 10:38.282
Yeah, what happened?

10:38.297 --> 10:40.080
Oh, nothing happened.
I mean, I think they just,

10:40.145 --> 10:43.133
I think there's a million reasons
why they can get delayed.

10:43.137 --> 10:45.081
You can ask her about it tonight, though.

10:45.737 --> 10:48.643
The four of you are going on a double date?

10:50.747 --> 10:53.483
I just pissed next to the cutest boy alive.

10:53.538 --> 10:55.313
Really? Who?

10:55.587 --> 10:58.342
- I don't know. I don't see him.
- I just got a text from Shane.

10:58.346 --> 11:00.321
She says your boss's house is really huge.

11:00.337 --> 11:02.501
Not as big as my boss's ego.

11:02.515 --> 11:04.781
Shane's doing hair
for his daughter's wedding.

11:04.787 --> 11:08.172
Wedding? I forgot to pick up my dress.
I have to pick up my dress.

11:08.178 --> 11:09.972
- I'm sorry. Have fun!
- Really?

11:12.608 --> 11:13.981
You know how Shane's doing?

11:13.985 --> 11:16.682
I think she just want
to get pass through the Paige stuff.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.320
You guys really think
that Paige burnt WAX down?

11:21.338 --> 11:23.820
I don't think it could be more obvious.
Really.

11:23.828 --> 11:25.890
She must have been really angry.

11:25.895 --> 11:27.340
Well, she's lucky that

11:27.348 --> 11:29.520
that Shane doesn't wanna prosecute.

11:29.527 --> 11:32.741
I'm just worried about Shane,
because I feel like everything's escalating.

11:32.757 --> 11:34.013
Escalating?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.151
- Well...
- Yeah.

11:36.158 --> 11:37.440
We used to say

11:37.456 --> 11:40.630
that every time Shane
walked into a room,

11:40.638 --> 11:43.533
some girl left crying.

11:43.538 --> 11:44.501
But now...

11:44.507 --> 11:47.352
No one's really ever committed arson
over Shane before.

11:47.575 --> 11:49.690
It's like, what's next?

11:50.567 --> 11:52.202
You are so good!

11:53.678 --> 11:55.143
I don't know what you're doing to me.

11:55.145 --> 11:56.430
But do that.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.322
Don't stop.

12:00.325 --> 12:02.583
I wish
my sister could get married everyday.

12:12.007 --> 12:12.962
Yeah?

12:20.536 --> 12:23.512
Well, I didn't expect
to see you back so soon, Williams.

12:23.517 --> 12:25.663
Although I can't say I'm sorry.

12:25.665 --> 12:27.903
I might be lonely right here
after you're all shipped out.

12:28.937 --> 12:32.090
Or maybe you need to sign yourself off
for active duty, Beech.

12:32.096 --> 12:34.403
Just going fat
sitting up here on this desk.

12:34.407 --> 12:35.660
You know, some of these guys
who stick around here

12:35.665 --> 12:37.970
<b>make sure all local...,
huh?</b>

12:38.848 --> 12:39.842
So,

12:39.848 --> 12:41.540
what's the deal, Williams?

12:41.546 --> 12:43.730
To what do I own this unexpected priviledge?

12:43.735 --> 12:45.510
I'm seeking counsel.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.902
I've been told I'm under investigation.

12:49.598 --> 12:51.482
Do you know the nature of the complaint?

12:51.488 --> 12:54.010
Well, I haven't been formally notified,

12:54.576 --> 12:57.812
but I believe I'm being investigated
for homosexual conduct.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.772
Very sorry to hear that.

13:06.567 --> 13:09.473
I'd like to start preparing my defense.

13:09.476 --> 13:11.321
I haven't been detailed
to your case, Captain Williams,

13:11.326 --> 13:14.160
and, as you can see,
I've very heavy work on my own.

13:16.498 --> 13:17.492
Look,

13:18.185 --> 13:20.303
I'm not trying to overboarding you.

13:21.438 --> 13:23.390
I need some advice.

13:23.407 --> 13:26.363
Williams, my best advice to you
is to mind your P's and Q's

13:26.397 --> 13:28.880
and think about whether or not
you want to stay in the service.

13:28.896 --> 13:30.653
I don't have to think about that.

13:31.036 --> 13:35.611
- I've dedicated my life to the military.
- I'm sure you have.

13:35.616 --> 13:39.292
But allegations like this
are almost impossible to disprove.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.461
Mostly because they end up being true.

13:42.468 --> 13:46.351
Once they're out,
the military doesn't want you anymore.

13:47.068 --> 13:49.190
Which is understandable,
don't you think?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.972
- "Stasch" by Coleman Hawkins -

13:57.527 --> 13:59.071
There he is.

13:59.078 --> 14:01.823
The beautiful boy
with the crystal blue eyes.

14:02.477 --> 14:04.023
Max?

14:04.025 --> 14:05.460
He's gay, right?

14:05.485 --> 14:06.992
Please tell me he's gay.

14:10.365 --> 14:13.913
- What? Something's wrong with him?
- No, he's very nice.

14:13.968 --> 14:16.870
Yeah. He, she... he's not gay anymore.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.270
- Anymore?
- So, he used to be gay?

14:20.735 --> 14:21.922
Well...

14:22.486 --> 14:25.211
- not exactly.
- Not exactly?

14:25.218 --> 14:27.052
He used to be a lesbian.

14:28.238 --> 14:29.891
He's a trans man.

14:31.076 --> 14:33.213
Oh my god! I had no idea.

14:33.768 --> 14:37.703
Hey! I see you guys later.
Bye! Love you, love you.

14:37.756 --> 14:40.422
- Hey, it's hot, hot, hot.
- Thanks, Kit.

14:40.425 --> 14:42.562
Hey, do you know that girl over there?

14:42.566 --> 14:44.402
That girl?

14:44.407 --> 14:48.143
The one who's been sitting here
for three days in the same ole clothes?

14:48.147 --> 14:50.103
Do you see what she's reading?

14:55.868 --> 14:57.190
Hey there!

14:57.198 --> 15:00.040
Oh, hi, I'm sorry.
Do you want me to pay?

15:00.046 --> 15:03.551
No, no, no, no. I just came over
to see if you wanted something else.

15:03.555 --> 15:05.481
No, I'm good. Thanks.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.750
I can't really afford anything else anyway.

15:07.757 --> 15:10.860
I'm sorry. 7 dollars
for a slice of pie, I know it's a lot.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.371
No, I didn't mean it like that.

15:12.377 --> 15:14.181
Well, what about if you had one on me?

15:14.188 --> 15:16.681
- I mean, the pear polenta tart...
- No, I can't...

15:16.688 --> 15:19.712
Come on. You...
You've got to have one, alright?

15:19.715 --> 15:22.570
Actually, you know what?
I'm starving. Thank you.

15:23.865 --> 15:27.092
So, how's the book?

15:27.096 --> 15:28.663
"Some of her parts"?

15:28.667 --> 15:31.032
It's like my fifth time reading it.

15:31.038 --> 15:33.511
Jennifer Schecter is my favorite author.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.020
You see that young man over there?

15:36.678 --> 15:38.423
He lives with her.

15:40.576 --> 15:42.663
- Do you wanna meet him?
- No.

15:42.668 --> 15:45.492
No, no, no. I couldn't...
I don't wanna bother him.

15:45.498 --> 15:48.953
Oh yeah, come on, come on!
Come on! You're gotta, baby girl!

15:48.998 --> 15:50.290
Come on!
Get your butt up! Come on.

15:50.296 --> 15:52.140
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.312
Uh, Max, Max!
What's your name again?

15:56.317 --> 15:59.051
- Adele. Adele Channing. Hi.
- Hi, I'm Max Sweeney.

15:59.055 --> 16:00.783
And I'm Kit Porter.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.961
It's so nice to meet you.

16:06.156 --> 16:07.760
Now you ready to rock.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.650
Go get married.

16:10.048 --> 16:11.231
Good luck.

16:20.198 --> 16:21.363
Shane!

16:21.366 --> 16:22.873
There you are.

16:22.887 --> 16:24.890
Look what happened.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.151
- "From Toys To Boys"
by The Emotions -

16:33.496 --> 16:36.270
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

16:36.275 --> 16:38.970
Could I have a medium triple cappucino

16:39.025 --> 16:41.272
with two pumps of vanilla, please?

16:41.276 --> 16:43.191
Can you also put it on my tab?

16:43.196 --> 16:45.523
- Thank you.
- Is this the famous Jenny Schecter?

16:45.527 --> 16:48.602
Kit, it's such a nightmare.
My fucking assistant Marissa quit on me.

16:48.605 --> 16:51.261
And I've been writing all morning
and I have to be at the wedding in

16:51.268 --> 16:53.713
one hour
and I don't have a wedding gift.

16:53.717 --> 16:57.551
Can you take a minute? There is someone
really special I'd love for you to meet.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.491
Great. Just crush the dress.

16:59.498 --> 17:00.441
I don't...

17:00.458 --> 17:02.522
I can't!

17:02.526 --> 17:05.642
Kit, I have to go buy my satin shoes.

17:07.454 --> 17:08.662
Adele,

17:08.665 --> 17:11.440
- I'd like you to meet Jenny Shecter.
- Oh my god!

17:11.448 --> 17:14.201
- I can't believe I'm meeting you.
- You are.

17:14.204 --> 17:17.653
It's great. You've met me. Max,

17:17.657 --> 17:19.723
will you please, please, please
do me a huge favor?

17:19.726 --> 17:21.661
Jenny, Adele's a huge fan of yours.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.040
She's read your book five times.
"Some of her Parts", right?

17:24.045 --> 17:26.740
Yeah. And, and,
and that book, "Sarah Shuster"?

17:26.758 --> 17:28.593
- 25 times.
- That's nice.

17:28.597 --> 17:31.531
I adapted it as a screenplay
for my women's studies class.

17:31.536 --> 17:33.843
What do you mean, you,
you adapted it?

17:33.856 --> 17:38.082
Oh but only, only... Only as a class exercice.
I mean, not as a publication.

17:38.085 --> 17:40.361
And what school did you go to, Aline?

17:41.036 --> 17:42.911
I went to the university of Central Florida.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.831
Jenny, her name's Adele.

17:44.838 --> 17:46.171
- I gotta go.
- What don't you come

17:46.257 --> 17:48.790
- and sit...
- Yes! Come on, come on.

17:48.798 --> 17:50.963
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes.

17:50.968 --> 17:53.191
Would you bring her coffee over, please?

17:53.198 --> 17:55.061
Oh, that's good!

17:55.105 --> 17:57.670
Oh yeah, oh, right there!

18:14.718 --> 18:15.721
What?

18:16.515 --> 18:17.582
What?!

18:17.587 --> 18:19.322
What? Did I hurt you?

18:19.328 --> 18:20.713
You suffer,

18:20.718 --> 18:22.770
- you're sure?
- No, I'm fine.

18:22.776 --> 18:24.811
Everything's gonna be fine now.

18:24.818 --> 18:26.392
Thank you so much.

18:27.508 --> 18:28.631
There.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.950
That asshole Rack is here with his wife.

18:33.955 --> 18:36.101
I want him to see me with you.

18:36.106 --> 18:38.302
Please, don't leave me tonight.

18:38.305 --> 18:40.570
Just don't leave me.

18:45.596 --> 18:48.922
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Joyce!

18:49.518 --> 18:51.550
- No!
- Yes!

18:52.576 --> 18:53.980
Don't say I shouldn't have.

18:53.985 --> 18:56.680
"Shouldn't have" is a thing
that makes me want you most.

18:59.005 --> 19:02.992
Joyce... Yeah!
Come sit down a minute. Yeah.

19:07.677 --> 19:10.120
What is it, Phyllis? What's on your mind?

19:12.525 --> 19:15.031
- This is hard.
- Well, whatever it is,

19:15.035 --> 19:16.552
just say it.

19:18.585 --> 19:23.213
You made a lovely proposal to me
and I want you to understand

19:23.217 --> 19:26.430
how very much it meant to me
that you would want to...

19:26.436 --> 19:28.051
to u-haul with me?

19:28.056 --> 19:31.501
Oh god! I'll never forget
you saying that. That was so cute.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.393
- It was?
- It was.

19:34.495 --> 19:36.280
Phyllis, look.

19:36.288 --> 19:38.421
I know you just got out of
a 30-year marriage,

19:38.426 --> 19:40.882
and if you need to take a little more time,

19:40.887 --> 19:42.263
just take it.

19:42.276 --> 19:44.102
I'm not going anywhere.

19:44.107 --> 19:47.080
So you're okay with me seeing other people?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.443
What?!

19:48.446 --> 19:51.051
No, no no no no no. That's not what I mean.

19:51.058 --> 19:53.701
- Please, understand.
- There's no understanding here, Phyllis.

19:53.705 --> 19:55.432
I'm not okay with that.

19:56.076 --> 19:58.682
- Are you already seeing somebody?
- No!

19:58.685 --> 20:01.130
No, I mean I want to, but...

20:01.135 --> 20:04.913
I told Camilla that I had to talk to you
before we did anything.

20:04.915 --> 20:06.291
Camilla?

20:06.295 --> 20:09.262
- My friend?!
- Joyce, she is not your friend!

20:09.266 --> 20:13.191
She's a friend of a friend! And
you met her at that party I threw for you!

20:13.196 --> 20:14.853
We both feel really bad about this,
but, come on,

20:14.895 --> 20:18.022
don't take it that way. It's not like,
you know, you versus Camilla.

20:18.047 --> 20:19.600
This is foul play.

20:19.615 --> 20:22.243
- I'm so sorry, Joyce.
- Thank you!

20:24.957 --> 20:26.870
Phyllis, you're being rash.

20:26.878 --> 20:29.101
Very rash.
I'm gonna leave now

20:29.196 --> 20:30.923
and give you some time
to think about your actions

20:31.027 --> 20:33.663
so you don't do something
you will regret later.

20:34.696 --> 20:36.213
- "Stasch" by Coleman Hawkins -

20:36.527 --> 20:38.872
I went on the scholarship. So

20:38.876 --> 20:41.023
it's the only school I know
that has

20:41.035 --> 20:43.740
both the women's studies program
and the film program.

20:43.746 --> 20:46.243
How come you wanted to go
to film school in Orlando,

20:46.248 --> 20:47.633
if you don't mind me asking.

20:47.636 --> 20:49.693
- Because she loves Disney World.
- No. I...

20:51.005 --> 20:52.752
Well, I just...

20:53.867 --> 20:56.091
I also was offered
a scholarship named by you.

20:56.097 --> 20:58.272
But it's of course where I wanted to go.
But...

20:59.037 --> 21:00.483
my mum

21:00.928 --> 21:04.823
had kind of a nervous breakdown
after my dad left her. So...

21:06.095 --> 21:08.651
I just stayed to take care of her.

21:08.655 --> 21:10.570
Is your mama okay now?

21:10.576 --> 21:12.610
Uh, yeah, she's better. She's better.

21:14.567 --> 21:17.772
We just... we had a tough time.
You know?

21:18.796 --> 21:21.831
I stayed to take care of her,
but then,

21:21.848 --> 21:24.743
she still took a lot of anger at me.

21:25.768 --> 21:27.252
You know what?

21:27.916 --> 21:30.063
It was reading this book

21:30.475 --> 21:33.302
that got me through that time.
It was reading "Some of her Parts".

21:34.025 --> 21:35.663
And this book

21:36.405 --> 21:38.250
saved my life.

21:39.058 --> 21:42.041
What a nice thing to say,
isn't that, Jenny?

21:42.496 --> 21:45.100
I went out and I found

21:45.105 --> 21:47.672
every single thing I could
about Jennifer Schecter.

21:47.676 --> 21:49.541
I found your first short stories collection.

21:49.547 --> 21:51.922
I read those stories
over, and over, and over.

21:51.948 --> 21:54.660
Miss Schecter, I just,
I can't tell you... Oh!

21:55.508 --> 21:57.742
- Jenny.
- Okay, Jenny.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.060
- Do you know why I'm here?
- No.

22:01.067 --> 22:04.302
In West Hollywood? I'm here
because I heard somewhere that,

22:04.305 --> 22:08.463
that this café was her inspiration
for the Pluto Café in "Lez Girls".

22:08.465 --> 22:11.222
I'm just, I'm so honored to meet you.

22:11.228 --> 22:13.530
Well, it's very nice to meet you too.

22:13.535 --> 22:15.921
Oh, hey, Jenny,
aren't late for a wedding or something?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.842
- What time is it?
- It's ten to two.

22:17.848 --> 22:22.160
That fucking assistant Marissa, well
she was supposed to get me the wedding gift,

22:22.175 --> 22:23.952
- and now I don't have a gift.
- So what?

22:23.996 --> 22:26.750
You can just give him after. I mean,
I'm sure they're registered.

22:26.757 --> 22:29.503
I'm so sorry. This is my fault.

22:30.028 --> 22:34.271
- Can I do anything for you?
- I mean, I'm not sure. Unless...

22:34.275 --> 22:37.382
I don't know. Unless you wanna go
to Garie's or Williams'

22:37.388 --> 22:39.082
to know where my name is registered

22:39.115 --> 22:42.113
and maybe pick up the gift on my behalf

22:42.115 --> 22:45.752
- and drop it off at the wedding?
- Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Definitively. Of course.

22:46.217 --> 22:47.710
I have nothing else to do.

22:47.715 --> 22:49.892
Good! Okay, good, good, good.

22:49.895 --> 22:51.012
Come on!

22:51.027 --> 22:55.211
You can help me pick up
a perfect pair of satin shoes,

22:55.215 --> 22:59.882
maybe carry that for me, and
tell me more about your experience.

23:04.916 --> 23:07.101
- Wow!
- You wanted that job, didn't you?

23:07.107 --> 23:08.270
As if!

23:08.285 --> 23:10.263
No, those days are gone.

23:37.098 --> 23:40.323
Looks like nobody warned you
about dropping the soap.

23:41.608 --> 23:45.311
- It just slipped from my hands.
- It just slipped from my hands.

23:45.318 --> 23:47.341
You hear that, Billie?

23:47.346 --> 23:50.833
- She's a fluff.
- Are you a fluff, pretty girl?

23:50.878 --> 23:54.000
I'm sorry. Maybe if you could just
explain to me what that is...

23:54.005 --> 23:55.883
Are you in for real trigger?

23:55.887 --> 23:58.492
Get away from me
or I'm gonna call security.

24:01.437 --> 24:04.273
Oh, she's strong too!

24:05.675 --> 24:09.990
I want you to clique up, bloody hands.

24:10.707 --> 24:12.540
It involves blood?!

24:12.545 --> 24:15.033
You're such a pretty girl!

24:15.038 --> 24:18.723
You know, what a shame
if something would happen to that face.

24:20.365 --> 24:22.282
Let her go, Jackie.

24:23.045 --> 24:26.031
- Why should I?
- Because she's with me.

24:32.036 --> 24:33.671
Suit yourself.

24:38.916 --> 24:41.240
But I'd keep my eye on her

24:41.245 --> 24:43.053
if I were you.

24:51.786 --> 24:54.523
He looked at me
like I had a fucking disease.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.381
I thought you guys
already knew each other.

24:56.386 --> 24:57.923
Well, we went to a leadership together.

24:57.927 --> 25:00.421
<b>But I didn't know
he was such a fucking... boy.</b>

25:01.035 --> 25:02.970
He hasn't even seen action.

25:02.975 --> 25:04.500
He'd probably shit his fucking pants

25:04.506 --> 25:07.312
<b>if his buddy got his...
blown off next to him.</b>

25:09.526 --> 25:12.043
Well, you know what? The good thing is,
you know where he stands,

25:12.046 --> 25:15.492
and now you can go get yourself a lawyer
that's not in the military. Right?

25:15.507 --> 25:17.500
I can't afford a civilian attorney.

25:18.065 --> 25:19.921
Let me help you, Tash.

25:20.447 --> 25:22.781
And I don't want a civilian attorney.

25:22.787 --> 25:23.983
Why?

25:24.357 --> 25:27.812
Because if I hire a civilian attorney

25:27.815 --> 25:31.991
then I'm basically just admitting that
I'm looking to get an honorable discharge.

25:31.995 --> 25:34.682
Beech said that's almost impossible

25:34.727 --> 25:36.732
to defend the "don't ask, don't tell" case

25:36.738 --> 25:39.103
because the allegations are usually true.

25:39.108 --> 25:42.250
Well, then forget Beech!
He's obviously a shitty lawyer.

25:42.256 --> 25:43.633
You can win this.

25:43.637 --> 25:47.972
And I don't even why the army tries
to keep gays out of the military anyway.

25:47.985 --> 25:52.320
I'm not fighting to allow gays
to serve openly in the military.

25:52.327 --> 25:55.132
I'm not even trying to overturn
"don't ask, don't tell".

25:55.166 --> 25:58.302
- That's not gonna happen right now.
- Then what are you fighting for?

25:58.307 --> 26:01.180
I'm fighting to stay in the military.

26:02.217 --> 26:05.322
I've worked my whole life for this, Alice.

26:05.325 --> 26:09.892
So, you've worked your whole life
to just deny who you are.

26:11.027 --> 26:14.081
I'm sorry, Tasha. I'm really just
gonna have to adjust my

26:14.085 --> 26:15.793
thinking on this one.

26:18.988 --> 26:20.722
I'm on your side, though.

26:22.036 --> 26:22.973
Okay?

26:23.948 --> 26:25.112
I am.

27:00.515 --> 27:01.812
Sorry.

27:06.548 --> 27:08.212
I sit here.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.670
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

27:11.678 --> 27:15.302
I'm so sorry. Here. Come on.

27:19.758 --> 27:23.032
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

27:23.605 --> 27:25.351
Yeah, we were all waiting.

27:25.358 --> 27:27.891
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make you wait.

27:27.897 --> 27:29.911
- Nice dress.
- Thanks, Tina.

27:30.395 --> 27:32.673
Honey? Honey? Honey!

27:32.678 --> 27:34.363
It looks like Madison isn't here.

27:34.395 --> 27:35.580
I don't know.

27:36.515 --> 27:38.782
- Have you seen Shane?
- No.

27:40.238 --> 27:42.630
I always do
everything I'm supposed to do.

27:44.327 --> 27:46.062
Everything my father wants.

27:48.707 --> 27:50.843
I try so hard to please him, but...

27:50.846 --> 27:52.512
he's never pleased.

27:55.498 --> 27:56.692
Well,

27:58.188 --> 28:00.653
forgetting your father for a second,

28:01.495 --> 28:03.263
what is it that you want?

28:04.077 --> 28:06.303
No one ever asked me that before.

28:07.998 --> 28:11.192
- Do you love him?
- Of course I love him. He's my father.

28:11.207 --> 28:14.160
I don't mean your father.
I mean your fiancé.

28:15.086 --> 28:16.422
He's sweet,

28:17.325 --> 28:19.300
and he treats me well.

28:19.307 --> 28:21.612
- Good.
- Madison, are you in there?

28:21.617 --> 28:24.583
- Just a second!
- Everybody's waiting, sweetheart.

28:26.598 --> 28:27.652
Do you uh...

28:28.506 --> 28:30.472
do you two have anything in common?

28:31.508 --> 28:32.593
Thanks.

28:32.966 --> 28:34.332
We uh...

28:34.336 --> 28:36.040
We're both adventurers.

28:36.595 --> 28:38.173
And we love to travel.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.590
And uh...

28:41.597 --> 28:43.953
<b>we really try to... a lot.</b>

28:43.957 --> 28:46.331
It just sounds like you're compatible.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.450
Does he listen to you?

28:49.458 --> 28:51.291
He always looks me right in the eye.

28:51.298 --> 28:52.912
Is he faithful?

28:54.097 --> 28:55.632
I'm pretty sure.

28:55.638 --> 28:57.311
Good.

28:58.076 --> 29:00.490
That's more than most people can say.

29:04.507 --> 29:06.272
You do look beautiful.

29:07.206 --> 29:09.603
Your hair's staying put.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.102
You're gonna be fine.

29:18.397 --> 29:20.490
You really are.
You're gonna be okay.

29:26.475 --> 29:29.021
Is there something better out there?

29:30.268 --> 29:33.593
I mean, Brad's sweet, but...

29:34.428 --> 29:37.151
He doesn't make me feel like we're gonna

29:37.156 --> 29:38.951
rock the world together.

29:47.097 --> 29:48.701
Madison,

29:49.765 --> 29:53.241
it sounds like you're looking for
something that uh...

29:54.256 --> 29:56.060
you use to do on your own.

29:56.407 --> 29:59.021
and no one could help you find it.

29:59.046 --> 30:01.393
But at the same time,
from what you're telling me,

30:01.398 --> 30:03.183
it sounds like you and Brad are

30:03.185 --> 30:05.362
gonna be great together.

30:06.568 --> 30:08.671
Don't throw that away.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.452
It's not that easy to find.

30:18.007 --> 30:19.211
And uh...

30:21.086 --> 30:23.043
well, you really

30:24.048 --> 30:26.321
remind me of somebody I used to know.

30:27.037 --> 30:28.270
A lot.

30:29.665 --> 30:31.452
No, no. It's, it's uh...

30:33.016 --> 30:34.400
It's a compliment.

30:38.087 --> 30:41.451
Well, you only got one shot.
Come on. Let's go do it.

30:46.576 --> 30:48.202
Yo, mama!

31:08.458 --> 31:10.283
What did they say?

31:10.288 --> 31:13.680
What were the actual words?

31:13.695 --> 31:15.843
I don't know.

31:16.905 --> 31:19.623
I think she said something
about cliquing?

31:19.626 --> 31:22.121
- Did she tell you to clique up?
- Yes!

31:22.127 --> 31:24.300
It means just joining a gang!

31:24.305 --> 31:25.862
She just wants you to join a gang.

31:25.867 --> 31:28.470
What use am I going to be to a prison gang?

31:28.476 --> 31:30.982
Really? I mean, does that mean
that Dusty

31:30.988 --> 31:32.371
is in a gang too?

31:32.377 --> 31:34.281
- Who's Dusty?
- Dusty's my cellmate.

31:34.298 --> 31:37.163
The one who I said went stepped
and went up to Jackie and said,

31:38.128 --> 31:39.603
she said: "She's with me".

31:39.638 --> 31:43.383
Oh, girl, baby girl, that means that
if Jackie even look at you wrong,

31:43.386 --> 31:45.833
she has to answer to Dusty.

31:45.836 --> 31:49.003
Girl, I hope Dusty is tough enough
to take care of you.

31:49.645 --> 31:51.322
Oh, she's strong.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.352
She's amazingly strong.

31:54.357 --> 31:56.622
<b>She doesn't talk much, but um...</b>

31:57.288 --> 32:00.872
When I first met her, I thought
she was a homicidal maniac.

32:00.887 --> 32:03.662
A homicidal maniac who saved your butt.

32:04.057 --> 32:05.311
Yeah.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.110
Yeah, I've been watching her.

32:08.148 --> 32:10.432
Wow, she's got this...

32:11.235 --> 32:13.832
that quiet intensity.

32:15.857 --> 32:18.052
She's fascinating, actually.

32:18.057 --> 32:20.492
She sounds like she's independant, girl.

32:20.525 --> 32:24.312
And that's the kind of friend you want,
you know what I'm saying?

32:25.636 --> 32:27.440
How do you know all that?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.493
I've been places, okay?

32:31.578 --> 32:34.321
Shit, have I...

32:37.318 --> 32:39.232
So, sometimes they tell you

32:39.238 --> 32:43.231
why you've been delayed,
but they don't have to tell you?

32:43.236 --> 32:45.792
Um, yeah, pretty much.

32:45.795 --> 32:48.140
I mean, you don't know anything

32:48.148 --> 32:51.710
for sure, until you're on that plane
half way to Irak.

32:52.465 --> 32:53.973
She doesn't know...

32:55.078 --> 32:57.323
- You can trust them.
- Don't.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.533
- Oh, shit.
- What?

33:05.698 --> 33:08.412
I thought Phyllis
already broke up with her, didn't she?

33:08.418 --> 33:10.291
I so don't wanna know.

33:11.505 --> 33:14.043
- They're breaking up right now.
- How do you know?

33:14.048 --> 33:15.933
Body language.

33:15.938 --> 33:17.432
Phyllis, listen.

33:18.188 --> 33:21.461
You can't leave me. I'm good for you.

33:22.095 --> 33:24.070
I'm rich, I'm smart,

33:24.076 --> 33:25.973
I'm great in bed.

33:25.978 --> 33:28.173
And I know you think
you wanna play the field,

33:28.175 --> 33:29.523
but I'm telling you.

33:30.037 --> 33:33.031
You will never find
anyone better than me.

33:36.756 --> 33:38.742
- "Ojala" by Pink Martini -

33:56.068 --> 33:57.591
Are you okay?

34:00.006 --> 34:01.141
I'm good.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.393
Do you see anybody here you like?

34:07.395 --> 34:11.690
Are you kidding me? This has got to be
the straightest wedding on earth.

34:12.036 --> 34:14.360
No lesbian's ever going to get laid here.

34:14.366 --> 34:16.860
Yeah, probably.

34:21.078 --> 34:24.600
I'd surely have a drink.
Let's go to the bar. Come on.

34:29.058 --> 34:30.911
Are you okay? You're acting weird.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.103
I'm fine.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.081
- Hi, Shane.
- Hi.

34:36.087 --> 34:37.850
Guess what.

34:37.898 --> 34:40.072
Willy loves you.

34:40.074 --> 34:44.152
He said the girls can't stop talking about
how you did them and I said:

34:44.167 --> 34:47.952
"Willy, can Shane please do hair
on the movie?" And guess what he said.

34:47.956 --> 34:49.550
- What?
- Yes.

34:49.556 --> 34:51.070
Yeah? Good.

34:52.047 --> 34:54.900
Tina, what did you get the bride?

34:56.065 --> 34:58.411
I got the bride for

34:58.417 --> 35:00.301
- expresso cups.
- That's nice.

35:00.308 --> 35:04.233
- What about you?
- Oh god! Thank god you're here.

35:04.237 --> 35:05.650
What did I get the bride?

35:05.677 --> 35:08.412
You got the bride a Limited Edition

35:08.417 --> 35:11.822
Kitchenaid Artisan Stand Mixer
in Metallic Chrome.

35:12.457 --> 35:13.842
Nice gift.

35:13.978 --> 35:16.520
- It's a dream appliance.
- I'd love that.

35:16.526 --> 35:19.990
- I brought you some cake. You're hungry?
- I guess so.

35:20.008 --> 35:21.353
Hi.

35:26.046 --> 35:27.493
I don't like that.

35:29.098 --> 35:30.412
I'm sorry.

35:30.417 --> 35:33.331
Let's put the gift on the table.
I'll see you later. Bye, Shane.

35:33.337 --> 35:35.083
- Bye, Jenny.
- Come on.

35:35.087 --> 35:37.503
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

35:37.506 --> 35:39.572
- Jenny's driving me crazy.
- Hi, Shane.

35:39.578 --> 35:42.040
- Hi, Gina.
- Do you wanna dance with me?

35:42.046 --> 35:44.682
You know,
I really don't like to dance.

35:44.687 --> 35:46.080
What, what, what?

35:46.086 --> 35:48.803
My asshole boss is over there.

35:48.805 --> 35:50.283
I have to talk to him.

35:50.297 --> 35:51.970
Oh god!

35:52.888 --> 35:54.991
- Please dance with me.
- Gina, you know...

35:55.037 --> 35:56.532
I want Rick to see us together.

35:56.538 --> 35:59.913
Okay, how about this?
I have to run through the bathroom.

36:00.676 --> 36:04.270
That's cute. I'll be back
in a few minutes, okay?

36:04.275 --> 36:06.810
Stay right there. Stay put.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.843
I'll come and find you, okay?

36:08.847 --> 36:11.412
- I'll be here.
- Okay! I love it!

36:12.228 --> 36:13.693
- "J'Veux Un Mec" by Adrienne Pauly -

36:22.555 --> 36:24.002
Guys!

36:24.006 --> 36:26.680
- Alice, don't.
- What?

36:26.688 --> 36:28.791
What is up with you two?

36:28.798 --> 36:31.421
This is really stupid. We should just tell them.
They're our friends.

36:31.427 --> 36:34.040
- Tell us what?
- Tasha's being held back

36:34.047 --> 36:36.920
because she's been investigated
for homosexual conduct.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.592
You're freaking kidding me?!

36:38.598 --> 36:40.670
And she has to keep a low profile,
so if you could just

36:40.675 --> 36:42.182
lay off the PDA.

36:42.745 --> 36:45.260
I'm sorry. You just,
you should have said something.

36:45.997 --> 36:48.842
I'm so sorry, Tasha.
I had no idea.

36:48.848 --> 36:50.742
No, I'm sorry.

36:53.638 --> 36:55.223
Be right back.

36:58.626 --> 37:00.270
What are you doing?

37:00.277 --> 37:02.863
I told you not to tell anybody.

37:02.868 --> 37:05.100
I know. I wasn't going to.
But I had to.

37:05.107 --> 37:08.211
You didn't have to do shit, Alice.
You just can't keep your mouth shut.

37:08.218 --> 37:11.312
Okay, I don't deserve that, alright?
I was trying to protect you.

37:11.317 --> 37:13.081
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?!

37:13.086 --> 37:16.550
<b>- You were sitting a...
- Alice, it's my life. Okay?</b>

37:16.585 --> 37:19.541
I determine when
and if people will know.

37:20.035 --> 37:22.433
They're not just people.
They're my friends.

37:22.438 --> 37:25.033
- You can trust them.
- Oh, it's not them I'm worried about.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.140
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

37:30.146 --> 37:31.680
Nothing.

37:31.686 --> 37:34.360
I'm sorry, nothing.

37:34.836 --> 37:38.481
I just don't understand what the big deal is
if they know.

37:38.486 --> 37:41.411
Because, Alice,
I don't want to talk about it

37:41.427 --> 37:44.991
and I don't wanna sit around
and listen everyone's opinions about it.

37:44.998 --> 37:48.060
And I don't want people to feel
like they can't be themselves around me.

37:48.065 --> 37:49.933
They don't feel that way, Tash.

37:49.938 --> 37:52.280
But see, this is why
I didn't even wanna come out tonight.

37:54.738 --> 37:56.091
Listen,

37:56.095 --> 37:58.792
I'm just having a hard time

37:58.796 --> 38:03.632
understanding why you wanna be part
of an institution that hates who you are.

38:03.638 --> 38:05.242
I'm struggling with that.

38:05.858 --> 38:10.361
But I know how important this is to you
and I know this is everything to you.

38:11.035 --> 38:14.633
And you're everything to me and
I'm just trying to stand here by you.

38:18.587 --> 38:21.441
I know. You're right.

38:23.888 --> 38:25.572
I'm sorry.

38:27.855 --> 38:30.290
I'm sorry too. I am.

38:32.207 --> 38:33.983
I like your posters.

38:37.588 --> 38:39.300
Isn't it sad, huh?

38:40.328 --> 38:44.333
Dorthy Dandridge died at the age of 42.

38:45.167 --> 38:47.983
OD'ed on anti-depressants.

38:48.567 --> 38:50.231
She killed herself?

38:50.237 --> 38:53.142
Well, they say it was an accident.

38:53.145 --> 38:56.703
You know, she was taking all these
different medication for

38:56.718 --> 38:59.851
her severely injured ankle.
Who knows?

39:01.076 --> 39:04.501
Apparently, she was really depressed.
It's so sad.

39:05.026 --> 39:07.321
I loved her in "Carmen Jones".

39:07.767 --> 39:09.450
Me too.

39:19.048 --> 39:20.142
Dusty,

39:21.535 --> 39:24.691
earlier, when you said

39:24.706 --> 39:28.321
- I was "with you"...
- Doesn't mean I want anything.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.683
Look who we ran into.

39:49.128 --> 39:51.520
Hi, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to take your seats.

39:51.527 --> 39:54.003
I'ts okay, it's okay.
We're actually gonna take off.

39:54.596 --> 39:56.810
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

39:57.027 --> 39:59.551
- Can you grab my purse?
- Oh, sure.

40:00.268 --> 40:01.533
- "Toi Et Moi" by Jil Caplan -

40:01.536 --> 40:04.400
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I've got to take a break.

40:04.408 --> 40:07.962
This one over here
can't wait to get between the sheets.

40:07.965 --> 40:11.143
I told her we need
to spend more time with other people.

40:11.146 --> 40:13.232
You know, spread the love.

40:15.806 --> 40:16.970
Tasha,

40:17.415 --> 40:19.530
I am so sorry, I had no idea.

40:19.537 --> 40:21.850
Don't be sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.

40:21.855 --> 40:24.680
- Alright. It was nice to see you, guys.
- Yeah, it's good to see you too.

40:24.687 --> 40:26.841
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:27.328 --> 40:29.962
Honey, could you please
bring me another glass of wine?

40:29.965 --> 40:31.132
Sure.

40:35.098 --> 40:36.391
Help me!

40:39.967 --> 40:42.073
- "Baby Don't You Go"
by The Miracles -

40:48.757 --> 40:51.630
Do you know that
you're the only man in my life?

40:52.307 --> 40:54.752
Well, someone would have to be.

40:55.748 --> 40:56.653
I'm

40:57.188 --> 40:59.012
very glad it's me.

41:00.075 --> 41:02.710
I've had the most amazing experience today.

41:02.716 --> 41:05.481
This woman came up to me
and she said that my book

41:05.486 --> 41:07.552
save her life, and I thought,

41:08.545 --> 41:12.670
I think our movie
is gonna have an impact on people.

41:12.688 --> 41:14.793
I know it is.

41:14.795 --> 41:16.643
- Do you?
- I know it is.

41:21.547 --> 41:24.441
It's so sweet.
I think I'm gonna puke.

41:24.468 --> 41:26.443
I think it's wonderful that

41:26.445 --> 41:29.241
a man who's spent his entire life
plundering wealth rich men

41:29.246 --> 41:31.763
now wants to change the world
through art.

41:34.055 --> 41:36.870
If you see Shane, tell her I left.

41:38.036 --> 41:40.043
But I don't know your name.

42:10.376 --> 42:11.880
- Ready to go?
- Yes.

42:11.888 --> 42:13.822
I don't know what to do.
I already broke up with her.

42:13.825 --> 42:14.973
Do it again, Phyllis.

42:14.985 --> 42:17.713
Some lesbians you have to break up
with more than once.

42:23.216 --> 42:25.180
I just wanted to say goodnight.

42:25.186 --> 42:27.893
- We're about to go on our honeymoon.
- Oh, good. I'm glad.

42:29.885 --> 42:32.100
- Well, enjoy yourself.
- Thank you.

42:32.106 --> 42:34.071
- You're welcome.
- For everything.

42:34.077 --> 42:35.280
You're very welcome.

42:38.975 --> 42:40.723
Rack's outside with his wife.

42:40.728 --> 42:42.853
- I want them to see us together.
- Gina,

42:42.858 --> 42:45.241
go to the kitchen and tell them
we're out of champagne.

42:45.716 --> 42:47.121
Pronto!

42:50.056 --> 42:52.671
Meet me downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

42:52.675 --> 42:53.900
What is it?

42:53.905 --> 42:56.173
You're just gonna have to come
and find out.

43:17.555 --> 43:19.493
Are you okay?

43:22.597 --> 43:24.381
You're having a nightmare.

43:26.687 --> 43:30.031
God! You were having a bad dream!
Alright?

43:34.307 --> 43:36.321
You're okay?

44:09.046 --> 44:12.630
You were defending someone, right?

44:14.005 --> 44:17.802
Oh, baby, you were set up.
Did somebody frame you?

44:17.806 --> 44:20.342
- Nobody framed me.
- I'm sure, whatever it was,

44:21.276 --> 44:23.670
you didn't mean to kill anyone.

44:23.677 --> 44:25.690
I haven't killed anybody!

44:25.696 --> 44:26.931
You didn't?

44:26.935 --> 44:28.990
It was tax fraud.

44:45.798 --> 44:47.671
- Are you Shane?
- What?

44:47.677 --> 44:50.353
Mrs. Hasley asked me to give this to you
right away.

44:57.566 --> 44:59.291
It's this way.

44:59.297 --> 45:00.692
Follow me.

45:04.205 --> 45:06.752
It's incredible that he decided
to finance your movie.

45:06.757 --> 45:10.190
Yes. William is so grateful
to be involved in the movie.

45:10.195 --> 45:13.772
He thinks it's gonna redeem all
these horrible things he's done for money.

45:13.775 --> 45:16.202
Well, it totally will.
I mean,

45:16.205 --> 45:19.591
you were just so amazing
for showing...

45:19.596 --> 45:22.503
Oh, thank you.
I like him. He's a nice guy and

45:22.938 --> 45:25.253
you'll get to know him
once

45:25.758 --> 45:28.122
you'd become my assistant.

45:28.585 --> 45:31.543
- What?
- Would you like to be my assistant?

45:32.027 --> 45:33.933
- Yes!
- Yes?!

45:33.935 --> 45:35.282
Thank you so much!

45:35.285 --> 45:38.403
You don't even know
how much I wanna be your assistant.

45:38.457 --> 45:39.823
- Do you?
- Yes!

45:39.828 --> 45:42.311
How much I'm gonna work
so hard for you. I will...

45:42.316 --> 45:45.261
- You are not gonna be sorry.
- Oh my god! I'm so excited.

45:45.267 --> 45:46.843
Yeah! Careful of the dress!

45:57.777 --> 45:58.812
Drink?

46:00.288 --> 46:01.711
Yeah.

46:02.875 --> 46:04.331
I think I'd better.

46:11.148 --> 46:12.720
Thank you.

46:13.476 --> 46:14.761
So, Shane...

46:16.198 --> 46:17.821
Yes, M'am?

46:17.828 --> 46:20.191
Don't be coy with me, Shane.

46:21.055 --> 46:23.910
I saw the way you looked at me
when you followed me up the stairs.

46:24.498 --> 46:26.550
- You did?
- Yes, I did.

46:27.477 --> 46:29.420
And it made me horny.

46:30.518 --> 46:32.510
I'm not crazy, am I, Shane?

46:34.656 --> 46:37.142
- No, no, no, I don't think so.
- Good.

46:38.096 --> 46:41.153
You know, Shane,
I would tell you a little secret.

46:41.158 --> 46:44.020
There's no lot I haven't experienced.

46:44.037 --> 46:45.200
I can

46:45.207 --> 46:47.240
go anywhere I want,

46:47.255 --> 46:49.313
buy anything I want,

46:49.995 --> 46:51.312
and

46:51.626 --> 46:53.583
it's starting to wear

46:53.995 --> 46:55.423
a little bit thin.

46:55.428 --> 46:58.130
- Mrs. Hasley...
- I want you

46:58.137 --> 47:00.393
to take me somewhere
I've never been.

47:02.946 --> 47:05.670
- I don't, I don't know if I could.
- Yeah,

47:06.268 --> 47:07.451
you could.

47:08.815 --> 47:10.321
And you will.

47:29.817 --> 47:32.031
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

47:32.036 --> 47:34.450
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

47:36.826 --> 47:39.920
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what is that?

47:50.407 --> 47:52.412
- Mother!
- Shane!

47:54.046 --> 47:56.440
Get away from her, you cow!
She's mine!

47:56.455 --> 47:58.501
Yours?! Shane,
tell them about us.

47:58.508 --> 47:59.973
What?

48:00.478 --> 48:04.211
Shane is a woman who can take you places
she's never been before.

48:08.168 --> 48:10.563
- Just wait until daddy finds out!
- Daddy will not find out!

48:10.566 --> 48:11.982
You're too low for her!

48:12.017 --> 48:14.162
Oh my god!
You can leave me!

48:14.175 --> 48:15.462
- Wait!
- Wait!

48:19.427 --> 48:21.072
- "Shattered" by The Trucks -

48:23.506 --> 48:25.912
- Sorry, sorry! Excuse me!
- Shane!

48:25.915 --> 48:28.480
- You're crazy! Shane!
- Shane!

48:31.046 --> 48:32.091
Jenny!

48:35.217 --> 48:36.881
Run, run! Drive!!!!
