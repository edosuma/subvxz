06:34.259 --> 06:35.562
and you--even your mannerisms.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.639
Like your physicality

06:35.661 --> 06:38.639
was even like Britney.

06:38.163 --> 06:40.600
Like just things

06:38.163 --> 06:40.600
like the way you like

06:40.699 --> 06:41.935
tucked your hair

06:40.699 --> 06:41.935
behind your ears.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.137

06:45.237 --> 06:46.639
- So good.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.141
- What we're judging on, on

06:46.740 --> 06:49.141
this show are three criteria.

We want vocal impression.

Does she sound like Britney?

06:50.909 --> 06:52.911
Physical embodiment.

06:53.790 --> 06:54.747
Do you move

06:53.790 --> 06:54.747
and look like Britney?

06:54.848 --> 06:56.382
Uh, yeah.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.382
- Yeah.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.550
- And overall

06:56.483 --> 06:58.550
entertainment value

06:58.651 --> 07:00.153

something very special.

07:07.259 --> 07:10.300
it's Britney, bitch.

07:07.259 --> 07:10.300
You know what I'm saying?

07:10.959 --> 07:12.197
So Britney gets on stage

07:12.298 --> 07:15.168
and she has coaches

07:12.298 --> 07:15.168
that teaches her where to sing

07:15.268 --> 07:17.637
and where not to sing,

07:15.268 --> 07:17.637
where to use your big power,

07:17.737 --> 07:20.874
where not to use your big power

07:17.737 --> 07:20.874
because Britney is a dancer.

07:21.410 --> 07:23.430
Like you came down some stairs,

07:21.410 --> 07:23.430
honey,

[cheering]

07:25.377 --> 07:26.545
- Yes.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.682
- So we would like to

07:26.646 --> 07:28.682
invite you to go work

07:28.781 --> 07:29.949
with our vocal expert

07:30.500 --> 07:32.819
to teach you where to pause

07:30.500 --> 07:32.819
and where to push

07:32.918 --> 07:35.454
and where to catch your breath

07:32.918 --> 07:35.454
and still get it going.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.925
But I work with Britney

07:35.555 --> 07:38.925
and she would be so proud.

07:39.590 --> 07:42.327
- Thank you, I love that.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.634
Before you even answer that,

07:47.733 --> 07:50.603
when she looked at me,

07:47.733 --> 07:50.603
I was like, "Hey."

07:50.704 --> 07:52.372
I'm sorry.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.372
I was a Britney fanatic.

07:52.471 --> 07:55.108
I'm sorry. I was just like--

08:46.393 --> 08:48.561
<i>I always wanted</i>

08:46.393 --> 08:48.561
<i>to be on the stage,</i>

08:48.661 --> 08:51.264

08:51.364 --> 08:53.365
<i>At the age of 15</i>

08:51.364 --> 08:53.365
<i>I got pregnant.</i>

08:53.466 --> 08:54.967
<i>A year after I had my son,</i>

08:55.679 --> 08:57.604
I literally got

08:55.679 --> 08:57.604
kicked out of my house.

08:58.904 --> 09:00.907
<i>For the first two nights,</i>

08:58.904 --> 09:00.907
<i>I had to sleep in my car</i>

09:01.700 --> 09:03.543
'cause I didn't have family

09:03.643 --> 09:06.111
or friends to take me in.

09:06.211 --> 09:07.681
But I looked at my son

09:07.780 --> 09:11.283
and I told him we're never

09:07.780 --> 09:11.283
going to sleep in a car again.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.831

09:24.931 --> 09:26.832

09:26.932 --> 09:29.402
<i>I was the one</i>

09:26.932 --> 09:29.402

09:29.501 --> 09:31.671
It was always inside

09:29.501 --> 09:31.671
of my brain and my heart,

09:31.770 --> 09:33.306
like, "I think I can do this."

12:44.697 --> 12:47.267
through the whole performance.

12:47.366 --> 12:51.104
Thing about J.Lo that makes her

so good is she's so polished.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.940
- What a lot of people

13:12.625 --> 13:14.940
don't understand

13:14.193 --> 13:15.928
about these performers is that

13:16.620 --> 13:18.639
you're running all over

13:16.620 --> 13:18.639
the stage, you're dancing,

13:18.163 --> 13:19.932
you're trying to sing

13:18.163 --> 13:19.932
while doing a hair flip.

13:20.659 --> 13:21.201
That's impossible.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.902
And it's so hard, you know?

13:23.690 --> 13:25.804
And I appreciate even you were

13:23.690 --> 13:25.804
trying to like engage

13:25.904 --> 13:27.974
with the crowd and be like,

13:25.904 --> 13:27.974
"Y'all ready for this?"

You don't have to do that much.

The stage is amazing.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.177
- They're so--it's going

14:02.708 --> 14:04.177
to be so good.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.470
- Britney and J.Lo!

14:07.113 --> 14:08.480
<i>- Coming up...</i>

14:08.114 --> 14:09.416
- * Did it again

14:09.515 --> 14:11.618
- Britney tone has

14:09.515 --> 14:11.618
a lot of cry in it.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.539
- Sometimes I do feel like

14:11.717 --> 14:14.539
I can't breathe as well.

14:14.870 --> 14:15.855
- So let's take a little bit

14:14.870 --> 14:15.855
of the cry out.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.823
- Okay.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.823
- * Let's get loud

14:17.923 --> 14:20.259
- We don't want the vocal

14:17.923 --> 14:20.259
to suffer

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
because we're trying

14:20.360 --> 14:21.360
to make sure

14:21.461 --> 14:23.629
that we hit all of the moves.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.238
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

14:32.338 --> 14:36.475
- Today, I am going to meet up

14:32.338 --> 14:36.475
with my vocal expert.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.412
So today's a really

14:36.576 --> 14:39.412
exciting day for me.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.147
- Connie.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.147
- Hi.

14:41.246 --> 14:43.482
- How are you? I'm Kuk.

14:41.246 --> 14:43.482
- Oh, my God.

14:43.582 --> 14:44.884
- So nice to meet you.

14:43.582 --> 14:44.884
All right.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.686
So tell me, how did you feel

14:44.984 --> 14:46.686
about your performance?

14:46.786 --> 14:49.621
- I felt that it was great,

14:46.786 --> 14:49.621
but it can be better.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.326
* Let's get loud,

14:49.722 --> 14:53.326
let's get loud *

14:53.426 --> 14:55.495
- You gave me J.Lo, the look.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.764
Unbelievable illusion.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.366
- Our vocal expert,

14:58.865 --> 15:00.366
he'll help you on like,

15:00.466 --> 15:02.101
here's where to breathe,

15:00.466 --> 15:02.101
here's where to sing,

15:02.201 --> 15:03.903
and I think that will take you

15:02.201 --> 15:03.903
to the top.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.337
<i>- Connie has all the moves.</i>

15:05.437 --> 15:08.740
She's got all the look,

15:05.437 --> 15:08.740
but it can't be at the expense

15:08.173 --> 15:10.429
of having

15:08.173 --> 15:10.429
a great live performance.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.245
I've had the privilege

15:10.143 --> 15:12.245
of working with Jennifer

15:12.345 --> 15:13.712
in the studio,

15:12.345 --> 15:13.712
getting her vocals

15:13.812 --> 15:15.782
and get her performance

15:13.812 --> 15:15.782
top-notch.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.650
So I'm honored

15:15.881 --> 15:18.650
to bring that to you.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.687
- I'm so excited.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.687
I'm so nervous.

15:20.787 --> 15:24.624
Kuk has worked with

15:20.787 --> 15:24.624
Jennifer Lopez herself,

15:24.724 --> 15:26.259
so I'm super excited.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.661
- I'll keep time

15:26.359 --> 15:28.661
and then you just do you,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.496
sing and just give it to me

15:30.596 --> 15:31.498
and then I'll make adjustments,

15:30.596 --> 15:31.498
all right?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.659
- Okay. Sounds good.

15:33.990 --> 15:34.734
- I'll give you those things

15:33.990 --> 15:34.734
that I feel like we need to do

15:34.834 --> 15:36.336
to get you to be

15:34.834 --> 15:36.336
at Jennifer's level.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.703
All right.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.703
- Okay. Awesome.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.172
- One, two--

15:37.803 --> 15:39.172
Let's get--

15:39.272 --> 15:42.341
- * Get loud, let's get loud

15:42.442 --> 15:45.477
* Turn the music up

15:42.442 --> 15:45.477
to hear that sound *

15:45.577 --> 15:48.782
* Let's get loud,

15:45.577 --> 15:48.782
let's get loud-- *

15:48.881 --> 15:49.783
- All right. So here we go.

15:49.883 --> 15:50.884
- And then that's

15:49.883 --> 15:50.884
the hair whip.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.351
- Got it. Got it.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.351
So as you're doing

15:52.451 --> 15:55.621
the movements, we don't want

15:52.451 --> 15:55.621
the vocal to suffer

15:55.721 --> 15:57.899
because we're trying

15:55.721 --> 15:57.899
to make sure

15:57.123 --> 15:58.424
that we hit all of the moves.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.193
Jennifer is 100% flowing.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.364
So I've never seen her

16:01.293 --> 16:04.364
look at the floor.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
You can't tell

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
what her next move is.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.735
We about to get you

16:06.732 --> 16:08.735
right up there.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.370
So now your tone,

16:08.835 --> 16:11.370
thin it out a little bit.

16:11.710 --> 16:12.538
- How do you--

16:11.710 --> 16:12.538
- * Let's get loud

16:12.639 --> 16:13.840
Sing it from here.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.275
You're singing it from...

16:13.940 --> 16:16.275
* Let's get loud

16:16.375 --> 16:18.345
Jennifer has a--

16:16.375 --> 16:18.345
has a softer tone,

16:18.445 --> 16:20.245
but it--but it cuts

16:18.445 --> 16:20.245
through, okay?

16:20.346 --> 16:22.820
- I think that's been

16:20.346 --> 16:22.820
my biggest struggle is

16:22.182 --> 16:24.417
because my tone is different,

16:24.517 --> 16:28.288
and I try so hard

16:24.517 --> 16:28.288
to sound like J.Lo

16:28.388 --> 16:30.389
and--and it--and it's hard

16:28.388 --> 16:30.389
and I couldn't figure it out.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.725
I'm like,

16:30.490 --> 16:31.725
"What am I doing wrong?"

16:31.825 --> 16:33.192
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

16:31.825 --> 16:33.192
it's just your natural voice

16:33.293 --> 16:34.326
is a little bit--

16:33.293 --> 16:34.326
a little bit rough.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.562
- There are some songs

16:34.427 --> 16:35.562
I can't hit--

16:35.662 --> 16:36.962
- No, it's all good.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.962
- For the love of God,

16:37.629 --> 16:38.298
I'm like, "How does she do it?"

16:37.629 --> 16:38.298
- So let's try this.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.566
Let's just work

16:38.398 --> 16:39.566
on the tone there for a second.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.734
- Okay.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.734
- All right.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.802
- * Let's get loud,

16:40.834 --> 16:43.802
let's get loud *

16:43.903 --> 16:45.270
- That's better, right?

16:45.371 --> 16:48.240
So singing it like that,

16:45.371 --> 16:48.240
you would--you would think,

16:48.341 --> 16:50.610
how am I gonna be heard

16:48.341 --> 16:50.610
singing like that?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.778
That's when you let

16:50.710 --> 16:52.778
the mic work for you.

16:52.879 --> 16:53.980
You put that mic--

16:54.799 --> 16:57.450
* Let's get loud,

16:54.799 --> 16:57.450
let's get loud *

16:57.549 --> 16:59.318
- Yeah, and I felt like

16:57.549 --> 16:59.318
I was screaming it.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.386
- Absolutely,

16:59.418 --> 17:00.386
and then that's when--

17:00.486 --> 17:01.453
- At the end

17:00.486 --> 17:01.453
I was kinda hurting.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.455
- Yep, that's when

17:01.553 --> 17:02.455
you're hurting...

17:02.554 --> 17:03.490
- Yeah.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.490
- Right.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.824
So let's do that again.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.824
One, two.

17:04.923 --> 17:08.228
- * Let's get loud,

17:04.923 --> 17:08.228
let's get loud *

17:08.327 --> 17:10.462
- Now tie that rhythm together

17:08.327 --> 17:10.462
with how you sing.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.700
* Let's get loud,

17:10.563 --> 17:13.700
let's get loud *

17:13.799 --> 17:14.701
- Okay.

17:13.799 --> 17:14.701
- You know what I mean?

17:14.800 --> 17:15.769
As you're doing that,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.202
make sure that you're focusing

17:17.303 --> 17:19.439
on every note

17:17.303 --> 17:19.439
that you're singing.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.573
- Okay.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.573
- That's the one thing

17:20.673 --> 17:21.941
that she definitely does.

17:22.420 --> 17:24.943
Every note on purpose,

17:22.420 --> 17:24.943
every single time.

17:25.450 --> 17:26.413
both: * Let's get loud

17:26.512 --> 17:28.213
- Beautiful.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.213
- Let's get loud.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.548
- Beautiful.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.951
both: * Turn the music up

17:29.648 --> 17:31.951
to hear that sound *

17:32.519 --> 17:34.153
* Let's get loud

17:32.519 --> 17:34.153
- Smile.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.690
- * Let's get loud

17:34.253 --> 17:36.690
- Absolutely.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.589
- * Ain't nobody gotta

17:36.789 --> 17:39.589
tell ya-- *

17:39.159 --> 17:40.626
both: * What you gotta do

17:40.727 --> 17:42.429
- That's it. That's perfect.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.763
That moment right there

17:42.528 --> 17:44.763
was amazing.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.132
Everything was right.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.132
- I was able--

17:46.231 --> 17:49.969
- You took the dip,

17:46.231 --> 17:49.969
flip the hair, and then sang.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.105
You didn't dip

17:50.700 --> 17:52.105
and sing at the same time.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.405
Perfect. Got it.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.874
- Thank you. Thank you.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.874
- Oh, you're welcome.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.910
<i>I was blown away by my session</i>

17:54.973 --> 17:56.910
<i>with Connie Pena.</i>

17:57.769 --> 18:01.114
I love the fact that

17:57.769 --> 18:01.114
she really does embody J.Lo.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.583
<i>All she has to do</i>

18:01.213 --> 18:03.583
<i>is go out there, be a diva</i>

18:03.682 --> 18:05.218
<i>'cause that's what</i>

18:03.682 --> 18:05.218
<i>Jennifer does.</i>

18:05.317 --> 18:06.786
<i>- With Kuk's advice,</i>

18:06.885 --> 18:09.220
I know when to do it

18:06.885 --> 18:09.220
and how to do it

18:09.549 --> 18:10.589
and it's not

18:09.549 --> 18:10.589
just the head whip.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.392
It's the timing,

18:10.690 --> 18:12.392
it's the vocals,

18:12.491 --> 18:14.861
so I'm going to make

18:12.491 --> 18:14.861
Meghan proud.

18:15.279 --> 18:16.289
- Hey. -

18:15.279 --> 18:16.289
How are you.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.696
Katie as Britney?

18:16.128 --> 18:17.696
- Hey.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.319
- I'm Kuk.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.319
So nice to meet you.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.432
- Good to meet you.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.432
- I watched your performance

18:20.532 --> 18:22.669
and I thought you definitely

18:20.532 --> 18:22.669
embodied Britney.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.836
- * Oh baby, baby

18:23.936 --> 18:27.339
* Oops, I did it again

18:27.440 --> 18:29.576
- Your mannerisms,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.576
like your physicality

18:29.675 --> 18:30.844
was even like Britney.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.378
Just things like the way

18:32.479 --> 18:35.382
you, like, tucked your hair

18:32.479 --> 18:35.382
back behind your ears.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.500
- We would like

18:35.481 --> 18:37.500
our vocal expert

18:37.150 --> 18:39.919
to teach you where to pause

18:37.150 --> 18:39.919
and where to push

18:40.529 --> 18:41.488
and where to you

18:40.529 --> 18:41.488
catch your breath.

18:41.587 --> 18:42.888
- You felt like the comments

18:41.587 --> 18:42.888
were right?

18:43.559 --> 18:44.557
- Yeah, it's hard

18:43.559 --> 18:44.557
to sing and dance.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.625
- Absolutely.

18:44.656 --> 18:46.625
- And sometimes I do feel

18:46.726 --> 18:48.528
like I can't breathe

18:46.726 --> 18:48.528
as well 'cause I'm like--

18:48.627 --> 18:49.895
- Exactly.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.163
'Cause we're putting

18:50.630 --> 18:51.163
that character on

18:51.263 --> 18:52.531
all the way through.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.201
We have to find a happy medium

18:52.632 --> 18:55.201
to do the character

18:55.300 --> 18:57.700
and also have

18:55.300 --> 18:57.700
some natural tone in there

18:57.136 --> 18:58.404
so you don't burn it out.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.606
Do some of the moves

18:58.505 --> 19:00.606
so I know how--

19:00.707 --> 19:01.607
- Okay.

19:00.707 --> 19:01.607
- How to fix the breathing,

19:01.708 --> 19:04.176
All right? Two, three, four.

19:04.277 --> 19:07.212
- * I think I did it again

19:07.313 --> 19:09.481
- Katie's pushing that Britney

19:07.313 --> 19:09.481
tone so much

19:09.582 --> 19:11.170
that she's running out

19:09.582 --> 19:11.170
of breath.

19:11.839 --> 19:13.252
What she needs to do

19:11.839 --> 19:13.252
is make sure that she adds

19:13.353 --> 19:16.221
her tone to Britney's tone

19:13.353 --> 19:16.221
and she's golden.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.692
- * I made you believe

19:18.791 --> 19:21.269
* We're more

19:18.791 --> 19:21.269
than just friends *

19:21.940 --> 19:22.194
- Absolutely. I love it.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.230
So Britney tone

19:22.295 --> 19:25.230
has a lot of cry in it.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.433
When I listen to her records,

19:27.534 --> 19:31.203
those whiny areas are placed

19:27.534 --> 19:31.203
in such perfect spots.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.705
It's not all the way

19:31.304 --> 19:32.705
through, right?

19:32.806 --> 19:34.400
- Okay.

19:34.740 --> 19:35.741
- So let's take a little bit

19:34.740 --> 19:35.741
of the cry out.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.277
* I think I did it

19:37.376 --> 19:38.711
- Okay.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.711
- Yeah, all right.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.580
One, two, three, four.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.883
- * I think I did it again

19:44.500 --> 19:45.151
- So here, how you did,

19:44.500 --> 19:45.151
"did it"?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.318
You did it on, "Did it."

19:46.419 --> 19:48.121
- Oh,

19:46.419 --> 19:48.121
so do it in the beginning?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.790
- Yeah.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.790
* So I think I did it again

19:51.891 --> 19:53.159
You know kind of go in

19:51.891 --> 19:53.159
and out of it.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.561
Two, three, four, one.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.698
- * I think I did it again

19:58.798 --> 20:01.101
* I made you believe

20:01.201 --> 20:03.536
* We're more

20:01.201 --> 20:03.536
than just friends *

20:03.635 --> 20:05.538
- Beautiful.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.538
- * Oh, baby

20:05.637 --> 20:07.374
- Yeah, absolutely.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.374
Yes, absolutely.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.441
- Okay.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.441
- That's it.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.808
Along with the moves,

20:08.540 --> 20:09.808
all right?

20:09.909 --> 20:12.778
One, two, three, four.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.981
- * Oops, I did it again

20:16.819 --> 20:17.683
<i>- What we need to do</i>

20:16.819 --> 20:17.683
<i>is split the difference</i>

20:17.784 --> 20:19.752
have Katie's tone,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.752
Britney's tone.

20:19.853 --> 20:22.188
And once we did that,

20:19.853 --> 20:22.188
the breathing wasn't a problem.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.691
- * Above

20:24.790 --> 20:27.594
* I'm not that innocent

20:27.693 --> 20:29.362
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

20:27.693 --> 20:29.362
- Yes.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.798
- That's it. That's the vibe.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.798
Now you got it.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.768
You were just thinking too much

20:31.897 --> 20:34.768
about the Britney tone

20:34.867 --> 20:37.700
and you have that down pat.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.239
So now just work in

20:37.170 --> 20:39.239
your natural tone

20:39.338 --> 20:41.700
and you're good, you feel me?

20:41.106 --> 20:43.809
She really has taken

20:41.106 --> 20:43.809
Britney Spears' tone

20:43.910 --> 20:45.577
and made it her own

20:45.679 --> 20:47.646
and she's really walking in it.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.915
- The advice that Kuk gave me

20:47.747 --> 20:49.915
will really help

20:50.160 --> 20:51.684
with my performance

20:50.160 --> 20:51.684
for the battle.

20:51.785 --> 20:54.953
<i>I don't have to push as hard</i>

20:51.785 --> 20:54.953
<i>with the Britney tone.</i>

20:55.549 --> 20:58.124
I just got to really bring it

20:55.549 --> 20:58.124
and be fierce.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.359
<i>- It's hard to sing and dance</i>

21:00.460 --> 21:02.895
and to do all the choreography

21:00.460 --> 21:02.895
at the same time.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.298
<i>They hands down</i>

21:03.630 --> 21:05.298

the hardest decisions

Unbelievable.

That was crazy.

How about this battle

26:08.835 --> 26:10.359

26:10.135 --> 26:13.390
These pop divas.

26:10.135 --> 26:13.390
Ester.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.607
- I feel like

26:13.138 --> 26:15.607

26:15.709 --> 26:19.412
J.Lo and Britney are icons

26:15.709 --> 26:19.412
from head to toe.

26:19.511 --> 26:20.713
- Absolutely.

26:19.511 --> 26:20.713
- Where not only

26:20.814 --> 26:23.782
do you need to sing like them,

26:20.814 --> 26:23.782
look like them,

26:23.883 --> 26:26.519
mannerisms, performance,

26:26.118 --> 26:29.388
the grit that it takes to get

26:26.118 --> 26:29.388
back and forth, change outfits

26:29.489 --> 26:31.523
'cause that's what

26:29.489 --> 26:31.523

26:31.624 --> 26:34.126
You both did a great job.

26:34.227 --> 26:36.695
Yeah.

26:34.227 --> 26:36.695

26:36.796 --> 26:38.431

26:36.796 --> 26:38.431

26:38.530 --> 26:40.266
You're going for it.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.266
You really want it,

26:40.366 --> 26:41.667
and I really admire that.

26:41.768 --> 26:45.605
And Katie, I just--I love the--

26:41.768 --> 26:45.605
I love the energy

26:45.704 --> 26:49.608
in which you're doing it with

26:45.704 --> 26:49.608
'cause it feels like Britney.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.911
- That feels so good to hear.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.911
Thank you.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.313
- We were asking a lot of you.

26:53.413 --> 26:55.815
You both worked really hard

26:53.413 --> 26:55.815
and brought it tonight.

26:55.914 --> 26:57.584
[cheers and applause]

26:57.683 --> 26:58.817
- Meghan.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.121
- You both went to

26:58.917 --> 27:01.121
our vocal expert

27:01.221 --> 27:03.390
and I hear so much improvement.

27:03.490 --> 27:05.557
You actually did

27:03.490 --> 27:05.557
what we asked you to do

27:05.657 --> 27:07.160
and you're both here to win it

27:07.259 --> 27:09.695
so this is gonna be

27:07.259 --> 27:09.695
one of the hardest decisions

27:09.796 --> 27:11.263
we've ever had to make.

27:11.364 --> 27:13.165
[cheers and applause]

27:13.266 --> 27:14.901
- The judges are gonna have

27:13.266 --> 27:14.901
the decision

27:15.349 --> 27:16.702
right when we come back.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.720
- Gotta pull out

27:16.803 --> 27:19.720
the boxing gloves.

27:19.172 --> 27:20.573
We're gonna have

27:19.172 --> 27:20.573
a tug of war on this one.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.875
- Yeah, and I'll fight you.

27:28.847 --> 27:32.519
<i>[rock music]</i>

27:32.152 --> 27:34.539
- Welcome back to

27:32.152 --> 27:34.539
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

27:34.869 --> 27:35.387
- Yes!

27:35.488 --> 27:38.579
- Now tonight, we witnessed

27:35.488 --> 27:38.579
two fierce pop divas,

27:38.124 --> 27:41.126
Katie Murdock as Britney Spears

27:41.227 --> 27:43.863
and Connie Pena

27:41.227 --> 27:43.863
as Jennifer Lopez.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.266
[cheers and applause]

27:46.365 --> 27:49.102
Judges, it's time

27:46.365 --> 27:49.102
to give your verdict.

27:49.201 --> 27:52.238
Who is our Clash pop diva?

27:52.338 --> 27:53.506
- You guys are great.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.474
I mean, the two artists

27:53.605 --> 27:55.474
are very different.

27:55.575 --> 27:57.143
You know, Britney and J.Lo

27:55.575 --> 27:57.143
have different strengths

27:57.242 --> 27:58.711
and different styles

27:57.242 --> 27:58.711
and energies

27:58.811 --> 28:00.613
and all that, but Katie,

28:00.713 --> 28:04.500
I feel like you have

28:00.713 --> 28:04.500
really studied all of it.

28:04.150 --> 28:06.152
It feels authentic.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.587
- * I'm not that innocent

28:08.688 --> 28:10.423
- Whoo, Britney!

28:10.522 --> 28:12.558
<i>- I think you going to</i>

28:10.522 --> 28:12.558
<i>our vocal expert</i>

28:12.659 --> 28:14.594
will just teach you

28:12.659 --> 28:14.594
where to pause

28:14.693 --> 28:17.130
and where to push

28:14.693 --> 28:17.130
and where to catch your breath.

28:17.230 --> 28:19.699
<i>- * Let them see you rise </i>

28:19.798 --> 28:23.359
- Your key is add your tone

28:19.798 --> 28:23.359
with Britney's tone

28:23.135 --> 28:26.472
and that will help sustain you

28:23.135 --> 28:26.472
through an entire performance.

28:26.573 --> 28:28.340
<i>- I've been doing this</i>

28:26.573 --> 28:28.340
<i>for 16 years,</i>

28:28.441 --> 28:32.444
but I feel like Kuk

28:28.441 --> 28:32.444
really helped me step it up.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.480
- You were just thinking too

28:32.545 --> 28:35.480
much about the Britney tone.

28:35.147 --> 28:38.884
<i>- I feel like I've grown a lot</i>

28:35.147 --> 28:38.884
<i>from when I first started.</i>

28:39.519 --> 28:40.353
- That's the vibe.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.155
<i>- * The ground </i>

28:43.256 --> 28:44.490
<i>* Can you feel it now? </i>

28:44.590 --> 28:47.926
- * Hit me baby one more time

28:48.609 --> 28:50.663
- I feel like

28:48.609 --> 28:50.663
I've just seen a show.

28:50.763 --> 28:53.700
[cheers and applause]

28:53.799 --> 28:56.802
- Connie,

28:53.799 --> 28:56.802
you had J.Lo's spirit as well.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.837
She is a fighter.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.837
She's tenacious.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.400
She is not giving up.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.740
That's why she is

29:00.140 --> 29:01.740
who she is today.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.843
So we can feel that.

29:04.099 --> 29:07.814
- * Let's get loud,

29:04.099 --> 29:07.814
let's get loud *

29:07.913 --> 29:09.516
- Our vocal expert,

29:07.913 --> 29:09.516
he'll help you on, like,

29:09.615 --> 29:11.170
here's where to breathe,

29:09.615 --> 29:11.170
here's where to sing.

29:11.116 --> 29:13.190
- * Get loud

29:11.116 --> 29:13.190
- That's better.

29:13.529 --> 29:14.554
It's all about control.

29:14.653 --> 29:15.922
<i>- This is an opportunity</i>

29:16.220 --> 29:18.490
<i>that I never thought</i>

29:16.220 --> 29:18.490
<i>was gonna be possible.</i>

29:18.590 --> 29:20.259
- That's it. That's perfect.

29:20.599 --> 29:22.828
<i>- I'm working so hard,</i>

29:20.599 --> 29:22.828
<i>and I've learned so much.</i>

29:22.929 --> 29:26.231
- You took the dip,

29:22.929 --> 29:26.231
flip the hair, and then sang.

29:26.332 --> 29:29.349
- At this point

29:26.332 --> 29:29.349
I'm ready to win, win, win.

29:29.134 --> 29:30.670
There's no going back.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.573
* My love don't cost a thing

29:33.673 --> 29:35.607
- This is gonna be one of

29:33.673 --> 29:35.607
the hardest decisions

29:35.709 --> 29:37.109
we've ever had to make.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.479
<i>* </i>

29:39.578 --> 29:41.413
- What I like to say is,

29:39.578 --> 29:41.413
at the end of the day,

29:41.513 --> 29:43.490
the effort is there.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.584
You girls came out

29:43.115 --> 29:44.584
and did something

29:44.683 --> 29:46.752
that is hard

29:44.683 --> 29:46.752
for even the artists to do.

29:46.853 --> 29:51.569
And a diva is a person

29:46.853 --> 29:51.569
who takes their job personally,

29:51.910 --> 29:52.726
and I feel like you women

29:51.910 --> 29:52.726
just got up there

29:52.826 --> 29:54.259
and did exactly that.

29:54.361 --> 29:57.963
[cheers and applause]

29:58.640 --> 30:01.134
But there is one winner

29:58.640 --> 30:01.134
tonight,

30:01.233 --> 30:05.672
and the winner is...

30:05.771 --> 30:07.207
J.Lo.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.207
<i>- * Can you feel it now? </i>

30:07.307 --> 30:08.575
- Connie Pena!

30:08.674 --> 30:10.609
<i>- * You got the heart</i>

30:08.674 --> 30:10.609
<i>of a phoenix *</i>

30:10.710 --> 30:13.913

30:16.160 --> 30:18.218
Congratulations.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.586
Connie,

30:21.387 --> 30:24.324
- Good job.

30:21.387 --> 30:24.324
- You are $10,000 richer

30:24.423 --> 30:26.259
and you're still in the running

30:26.358 --> 30:30.529
to appear live on "The Tonight

30:26.358 --> 30:30.529

30:30.630 --> 30:34.670
It's a lot of love.

30:30.630 --> 30:34.670
It's a lot of celebration.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.469
Connie, let us know

30:34.166 --> 30:36.469
how you're feeling right now.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.569
There's a lot of emotions,

30:36.568 --> 30:37.569
I know.

30:37.671 --> 30:38.971
- Oh, my God.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.420
Like, I'm shaking.

30:39.720 --> 30:42.420
[laughs]

30:42.142 --> 30:44.443
You guys,

30:42.142 --> 30:44.443
you know how hard it is.

30:44.544 --> 30:47.646
I had to prove to you guys

30:44.544 --> 30:47.646
so much

30:47.747 --> 30:49.182
and especially to my children.

30:49.281 --> 30:52.251
They believed in me, and

30:49.281 --> 30:52.251
I'm just wowed and grateful.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.752
But thank you, guys.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.752
Thank you.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.890
I'm, like, so emotional,

30:53.853 --> 30:56.890
right now.

30:56.189 --> 30:57.123
Thank you.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.250
- Let's continue

30:57.222 --> 30:59.250
making some noise.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.560
Monumental night right now.

31:01.661 --> 31:04.640
Thank you to both of these

31:01.661 --> 31:04.640
artists for bringing the fire,

We'll see you next time

31:09.336 --> 31:12.137
on "Clash for the Cover Bands."

- Mr. bass player.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.253
I'm obsessed with you.

31:28.355 --> 31:31.910
- I'm all about that bass,

31:28.355 --> 31:31.910
girl.

31:31.191 --> 31:32.925
- What we need to do

31:31.191 --> 31:32.925
is pump up the energy.

31:33.930 --> 31:34.126
Go! Go!
