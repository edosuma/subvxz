WEBVTT

01:20.997 --> 01:22.207
Ooh! Oh!

01:23.708 --> 01:24.709
Wait! Oh!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.629
Oh God.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.405
Wow, that sunset.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.450
Incredible.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.201
Did you buy that
with the money you won from me?

02:42.036 --> 02:43.955
No. I got this with my own money.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.249
You want one?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.007
Is that the only gambling you do?

02:55.508 --> 02:58.219
One time,
I bet my whole life on something.

02:59.012 --> 02:59.846
Did you win?

03:01.347 --> 03:02.265
I plan to.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.773
Do you live near here?
I saw you playing at the Go house.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.400
I guess you live around here.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.235
I'm close, so…

03:15.111 --> 03:15.945
Do you work nearby?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.824
Why aren't you eating?
Don't eat food from convenience stores?

03:19.908 --> 03:22.243
Can't say I do. Watching my carbs.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.583
You don't like to share much, do you?

03:28.666 --> 03:30.585
Do you usually ask so many things?

03:30.668 --> 03:34.964
Normally, I keep quiet, believe it or not.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.348
Why do you like to play Go?

03:46.017 --> 03:50.021
I like it because you engage
in an intense battle in silence.

03:51.689 --> 03:56.778
And also, I like that you get to destroy
somebody's house in order to win.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.673
Why don't we play together sometime?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.635
Since I now know what you like.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.555
JAEPYEONG CONSTRUCTION
CEO HA DO-YEONG

04:24.639 --> 04:25.640
I'm Ha Do-yeong.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.188
Next time,
bring some more money when we play.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.482
You won't eat this, right?

05:01.175 --> 05:03.094
Is that supposed to be your breakfast?

05:06.222 --> 05:07.974
You come here every morning, huh?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.768
Do you ever cook for yourself?

05:12.353 --> 05:14.188
Did you have
your breakfast already?

05:16.733 --> 05:19.027
Semyeong Elementary,
is that where you work?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.987
I noticed the sticker on your car.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.739
That's a great job to have.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.788
Can I ask you about something as well?

05:32.373 --> 05:34.792
You're the owner
of Semyeong Real Estate, right?

05:34.876 --> 05:38.713
I think you were the one I ran into
when I first looked for a place.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.007
Yeah, that was me.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.676
Ever since I moved in here,

05:44.719 --> 05:47.221
I noticed that my rent's
less than anyone else's around.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.557
Why did you do that?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.643
It's a good thing when the rent's so low.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.313
A teacher doesn't make much these days.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.567
But you couldn't have known
that I was a teacher.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.450
I'm sorry for asking here,

06:08.659 --> 06:12.622
but is it 'cause the condo's haunted?

06:13.956 --> 06:14.791
Huh?

06:19.003 --> 06:21.756
I was thinking you had
absolutely no sense of humor.

06:21.839 --> 06:22.840
That's rich.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.802
Make sure that you take
your trash with you

06:25.885 --> 06:27.261
when you head back down.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.270
<i>Here are</i>
<i>my receipts, parking, gas,</i>

06:36.354 --> 06:38.398
<i>and everything else</i>
<i>I needed for our operation.</i>

06:38.481 --> 06:39.565
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

06:39.649 --> 06:41.609
<i>Seems like revenge is pretty expensive.</i>

06:47.657 --> 06:48.574
MONTHLY PARKING FEE

06:48.658 --> 06:51.119
-GAS MONEY
-OTHER EXPENSES

06:51.202 --> 06:54.956
<i>I spent my twenties tutoring</i>
<i>so I could pay for things like this.</i>

06:55.456 --> 06:57.959
<i>I've got plenty saved up, so don't worry.</i>

07:07.218 --> 07:08.594
<i>After following them,</i>

07:08.678 --> 07:10.972
<i>I found Hye-jeong is</i>
<i>the easiest to predict.</i>

07:11.055 --> 07:12.473
<i>She's always on her phone.</i>

07:12.974 --> 07:15.560
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>I should try and steal her phone.</i>

07:16.227 --> 07:17.895
<i>I think I can be pretty talented.</i>

07:27.488 --> 07:29.198
I THINK I'M PRETTY TALENTED

07:31.826 --> 07:33.286
<i>Could you do that?</i>

07:34.245 --> 07:35.580
<i>Just leave it to me.</i>

07:36.164 --> 07:38.833
<i>By the way, did you meet</i>
<i>Park Yeon-jin in person yet?</i>

07:38.916 --> 07:40.501
<i>Everything went smooth, right?</i>

07:47.258 --> 07:48.509
<i>Do you want to meet?</i>

07:52.513 --> 07:54.682
Were you scared? Intimidated?

07:54.765 --> 07:57.768
You should have stomped on her soul
like she was nothing but a piece of paper.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.439
I did one of those things.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.733
That's good. I'm glad.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.152
That's really good. Great job.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.696
I was so worried about you.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.656
Oh!

08:12.200 --> 08:13.951
Remember Park Yeon-jin's mom?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.496
Oh, the photo came out blurry.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.458
She visited that shaman again,
two weeks after her last visit.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.709
With the same man, too.

08:21.792 --> 08:25.630
I thought they might be dating,
but they leave in separate cars.

08:25.713 --> 08:27.256
They even arrive separately.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.176
If there's a pattern here,
there must be a reason.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.137
-Let me know if you find anything else.
-Uh-huh.

08:34.055 --> 08:37.975
And did you happen to tail this person?

08:39.519 --> 08:40.520
What do you mean by tail?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.563
Just don't try to follow this man.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.983
I didn't want to scare you
so I didn't tell you this,

08:46.067 --> 08:47.068
but he's a cop.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.988
When we first met, he was the chief.
Maybe he moved up.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.616
He's the senior
superintendent-general at Bukbu.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.911
He's fallen behind most of his classmates
who are all chiefs now.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.955
How did you know that?

08:59.455 --> 09:01.916
Didn't you see the receipts
for that soup restaurant?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.377
I found four soup restaurants
near the police station,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.212
and just waited for him.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.383
When you threatened me
the first time we met…

09:12.468 --> 09:15.054
I had no idea how scary you really are.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.098
Me?

09:24.480 --> 09:25.648
Don't put yourself at risk.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.278
Yeah, I won't.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.948
Oh, and can you look here for me?
Think of this as part of the job.

09:34.031 --> 09:34.949
Hang on, I don't--

09:47.211 --> 09:50.089
What?
Is something wrong? Are you okay?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.300
I'm… I'm so sorry.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.385
Oh…

09:54.468 --> 09:56.637
I'm good at pictures of flowers and birds.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.016
But when I take photos of people,
my hands start to shake.

10:06.814 --> 10:07.898
It's okay now.

10:12.069 --> 10:12.987
Take another.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.001
I wanna try one more.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.995
My, oh, my.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.331
Ye-sol, sweetie,
it's your first Gucci, huh?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.210
Do you like what Grandma got you? Hmm?

11:09.293 --> 11:11.629
"Babies can't tell the difference."

11:11.712 --> 11:14.006
"Why get Gucci
when she won't be wearing it in a month?

11:14.674 --> 11:15.758
Is that right?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.804
-Yes?
-You know, you reap what you sow.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.849
You only live the way you do,
because of the way you think.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.019
-Go get a new nanny.
-Sure.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.691
Everything I owe you will be
deposited directly into your account.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.526
Thanks for your work.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.987
Screw this.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.870
Hold onto her newborn clothes
so she has it for any important event.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.207
Like when you had her,
you'll need to try your hardest.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.210
I did it for Do-yeong.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.962
Yes, of course.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
Hi! Oh!

11:57.216 --> 11:58.134
Ye-sol, honey.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.052
Say "Grandma" for me.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.971
Say "Grandma."

12:02.972 --> 12:08.602
I will make sure Ye-sol never
<has to try her hardest for anything.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.535
Hey, how has my favorite principal been?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.787
If you're free, can I see you?

12:27.913 --> 12:28.831
Yeah, now works.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.958
The homeroom teacher?

12:31.459 --> 12:34.003
The school's chairman
recommended her to us.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.089
Actually, the school was
in a bit of a tight spot,

12:37.173 --> 12:38.424
since Mr. Yang quit so suddenly.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.592
I'm sorry, hold on.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.637
So you're telling me that Dong-eun
personally knows the chairman?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.639
-How does she?
-Uh…

12:46.682 --> 12:48.017
I'm not too sure.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.937
Okay, so is she
even qualified for the job?

12:52.021 --> 12:52.938
Oh, no, no.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.858
We made sure to do our own research,
and her CV is great.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.276
It's odd though.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.154
It's rare for teachers to transfer
from public to private schools.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.614
Ah. I see.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.243
Could I possibly
take a peek at her resume, then?

13:07.077 --> 13:11.957
Ah, well, we have to be careful
with private information nowadays.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.752
Ah. Of course. I know I can't ask that.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.131
So you could just happen to be
holding her resume right now,

13:20.007 --> 13:21.634
and I could just steal a glance.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.511
How's that sound?

13:30.684 --> 13:33.103
Hey! You're doing it wrong!

13:35.022 --> 13:37.149
You can't color it like that!

13:56.961 --> 13:57.795
Hey, Ms. Moon!

13:57.878 --> 14:00.506
You're supposed to color
cherry blossoms pink, right?

14:00.589 --> 14:01.966
She's doing it wrong!

14:02.049 --> 14:03.843
I can color them however I want.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.470
Cherry blossoms can be see-through.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.389
You can't do it like that!

14:08.472 --> 14:11.809
Ms. Moon, her drawing is all wrong, right?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.520
Hmm.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.065
Seung-a's tulips are full of color,

14:18.566 --> 14:22.319
but Ye-sol's colorless cherry blossoms
are still pretty.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.613
Both are incredible.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.254
Why don't we all
try to finish our drawings?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.445
How much?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.406
Stop playing around now.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.533
I can give it to you.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.203
So just ask for whatever you want.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.874
I promise I'll pay you
for damages, all right?

15:17.833 --> 15:18.876
Mental and physical.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.004
You've just made a lot of money.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.304
Guess we'll sign something.

15:30.387 --> 15:34.141
"Until I die,
you will never see my face ever again."

15:34.808 --> 15:36.894
I'll need that in writing
with your signature.

15:36.977 --> 15:41.774
Like how your mom
signed your high school withdrawal letter.

15:42.608 --> 15:46.195
For people like you, it's usually
their parents who destroy their lives.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.072
You're angry at the wrong person.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.367
Don't try to act tough.
Just tell me how much.

15:51.867 --> 15:52.952
No, wait.

15:54.036 --> 15:57.623
You're not doing this because you want
a sincere apology, are you?

15:58.415 --> 16:01.460
I mean, we're almost 40.
That's only happens in fairy tales.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.711
That's all history now!

16:04.088 --> 16:06.757
What do you want me
to do about it now? Really?

16:10.344 --> 16:11.345
Of course, I don't.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.555
Don't say sorry.

16:14.390 --> 16:18.394
I didn't bet all of my teens,
twenties, and thirties for an apology.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.229
You deserve to be punished.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.399
If God's on your side, it's what you owe.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.317
If not, you'll know God's fury.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.610
God?

16:27.903 --> 16:30.072
So we're in the scripture,
not a fairy tale?

16:31.198 --> 16:32.199
What God?

16:33.283 --> 16:34.201
Not mine.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.121
So you're holding my daughter hostage.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.833
And? You think God will help?

16:43.210 --> 16:44.128
Hostage?

16:45.170 --> 16:46.005
Who, me?

16:46.588 --> 16:47.840
Have I done anything?

16:49.049 --> 16:50.926
Has Ye-Sol ever been choked by me?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.595
Have I punched her?
Have I slapped her ever?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.431
Or have I burned her with an iron?

16:56.724 --> 16:58.976
So tell me. What have I done to her?

17:07.693 --> 17:11.196
You know, I've actually tried
to be very supportive of her,

17:11.280 --> 17:14.450
as she lives in a world where she doesn't
know that the rainbow has seven colors…

17:14.533 --> 17:15.367
HA YE-SOL

17:15.451 --> 17:17.745
…or can't even tell when food is ripe.

17:17.828 --> 17:21.498
In my classroom,
things like colors don't matter at all.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.167
And that might be…

17:24.710 --> 17:26.795
not great for the position you're in.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.380
How do you…

17:32.134 --> 17:33.427
How'd you find out?

17:33.510 --> 17:35.387
I won't do anything to her.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.973
I can do things to you, though.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.894
For example, parent-teacher conferences.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.064
And as you know,
the mother's not the only person

17:45.647 --> 17:48.400
who goes to parent-teacher conferences.

17:57.659 --> 17:58.911
So, never test me

18:01.121 --> 18:02.831
on how far I'm willing to go,

18:04.208 --> 18:06.710
or how far I can
make you suffer, Yeon-jin.

18:07.961 --> 18:12.174
I want you to slowly wither away,
so you understand how it feels.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.512
Slowly, the two of us will die together.

18:16.595 --> 18:17.596
You get that?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.183
I'm so excited for us.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.824
That's quite an interesting pair.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.742
Wonder what's up.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.745
Hey, Bixby.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.956
Call "Son of a Bitch" for me.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.001
<i>Calling "Son of a Bitch."</i>

18:49.253 --> 18:50.587
SON OF A BITCH

18:51.338 --> 18:53.924
<i>The person</i>
<i>you are trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

18:54.007 --> 18:56.677
-Shit.
<i>-Please leave a message after the beep…</i>

18:56.760 --> 18:58.637
Has that motherfucker really lost it?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.353
Mr. Jeon, someone dropped off
a package for you.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.439
-To here?
-Yes, sir.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.899
Right here, on the street?

19:13.193 --> 19:14.486
They the Avengers?

19:20.909 --> 19:23.662
HA YE-SOL

19:25.789 --> 19:26.790
What is this?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.379
HA YE-SOL

19:35.340 --> 19:37.509
Looks like
my secretary's doing a shitty job.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.052
Outsiders aren't allowed in.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.388
Make a lot of money today?

19:42.973 --> 19:45.809
I like it when you wear your work clothes.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.228
I like it better
than when you wear your full suit.

19:48.896 --> 19:49.980
It's so sexy.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.818
I guess you just put Prada
and Versace out of business.

19:57.487 --> 20:01.950
Honey, should we send Ye-sol
abroad for school?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.036
What're you saying?

20:05.329 --> 20:07.206
Ye-sol is only six years old.

20:08.248 --> 20:11.668
There are a lot of professional guardians
who can keep an eye on her.

20:14.588 --> 20:18.217
Why all of a sudden?
Is it 'cause you want to go abroad?

20:19.301 --> 20:20.594
No, nothing like that.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.137
Then that's even stranger.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.266
You won't even let the nanny
take her to school without a driver.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.018
Now you want to send her abroad?

20:28.518 --> 20:32.064
Sweetie, I heard you've been
golfing a lot with Chairman Kim, right?

20:32.648 --> 20:36.109
Would you be able to arrange
a meeting for us, just this once?

20:36.193 --> 20:38.904
Uh, Ye-sol got a new homeroom teacher,

20:39.863 --> 20:41.406
and she's insane.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.991
How is she "insane?"

20:43.075 --> 20:45.786
Is it that bad that you need
to involve the chairman?

20:45.869 --> 20:48.038
I'll need to know more
before I can do anything.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.500
Actually, don't worry.

20:51.583 --> 20:54.419
I think I'm just a little
overly tired right now.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.465
Now, I'm off to my mother's before work.
I'll call you later.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.065
Her finances, boyfriends, and any family.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.150
Her friends, coworkers, and anyone else.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.944
Just find out everything.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.154
Good one!

21:21.780 --> 21:23.699
Your mother broke 90 yesterday.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.616
RÉSUMÉ
MOON DONG-EUN

21:24.700 --> 21:26.201
Dong-eun. Who is she?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.661
JAE-JUN

21:28.245 --> 21:30.956
That's what I'm asking you right now.
I wanna know everything.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.709
Anything I already know
about her is worthless.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.400
Dissolving tablets?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.028
Yeah.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.947
You know how
a bunch of bubbles start coming up

22:04.031 --> 22:06.366
when you drop
one of those tablets into water?

22:06.992 --> 22:09.953
I start feeling calmer
when I'm listening to that sound.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.790
And why do you think
that sound helps calm you down?

22:15.959 --> 22:18.962
It kinda sound like ginko leaves,
shaking in the wind.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.798
And maybe raindrops
falling softly on a Go board.

22:22.883 --> 22:26.970
And when I keep listening to it,
I start to feel lonely.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.558
Something like that.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.937
Your body's feeling healthy,
while your heart's feeling lonely.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.399
I think it might do you some good
if you changed up your environment.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.568
Like move somewhere new, go on a trip.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.320
I might consider it. Thank you.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.281
I have patients to see.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.327
You must be a good doctor,
since you're always late for our therapy.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.789
But you get paid hourly.
Wouldn't you want me late?

22:58.085 --> 23:01.129
We'll have to run a CT to be sure.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.633
Since it feels hard,
there's a good chance it's osteoma.

23:04.716 --> 23:08.220
Do I really need surgery?
But I can hardly feel anything at all.

23:08.303 --> 23:12.140
You might not have symptoms now,
but it'll start causing discomfort later.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.058
Ah.

23:13.141 --> 23:16.478
So if I do get surgery,
how long will I stay in the hospital?

23:16.561 --> 23:19.147
I teach elementary school,
so I want to do it during a break.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.315
Mmm, probably a week,

23:20.399 --> 23:22.901
with all the exams
and other possible procedures.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.738
-Did you say you were a teacher?
-Yeah.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.448
At what school?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.741
How do you enjoy working there?

23:29.825 --> 23:30.784
I've been watching vlogs

23:30.867 --> 23:33.370
where the teachers are always so busy
taking care of the children,

23:33.453 --> 23:34.413
even during their lunch.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.915
Do you find that the kids
actually listen to you?

23:37.833 --> 23:40.001
Are you also a parent?

23:40.085 --> 23:42.045
Oh, I'm not.

23:42.129 --> 23:46.216
Uh, I'm interested in
what teachers usually do, not the kids.

23:46.299 --> 23:47.134
What?

24:15.412 --> 24:22.210
SHANGHAI

24:44.232 --> 24:45.901
You, did you lose some weight?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.652
Yeah, a little.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.947
I thought I told you
that our weights need to match.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.574
Now, it won't look the same!

24:52.657 --> 24:55.410
-You should apologize right now.
-I'm so sorry.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.332
Ugh. Just return it. Next one.

25:00.415 --> 25:01.500
I'll do it right now.

25:04.836 --> 25:07.839
Make sure you bring your weight up
before your next flight.

25:08.423 --> 25:10.800
If your weight changes again…

25:10.884 --> 25:12.260
Shit, what's this?

25:13.720 --> 25:14.804
What the fuck?

25:16.139 --> 25:17.891
Did your phone get switched with another?

25:17.974 --> 25:19.643
How the hell would I know?

25:19.726 --> 25:22.896
Call Incheon International!
Hurry and ask if they found a phone.

25:22.979 --> 25:23.813
Okay.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.652
What the fuck is this shit? Ugh!

25:34.115 --> 25:35.116
You got it?

25:42.499 --> 25:45.252
Well, it was all very easy.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.671
Got anything else? Tell me what you need.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.133
You did a great job.
I'll see you next time.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.636
Oh, hold on, just wait. Just one second.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.764
You always act so cold whenever I see you.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.142
Here, try this.

26:01.226 --> 26:04.271
I thought we'd be meeting outside again.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.940
Last time, I liked that
it was kinda like a picnic.

26:08.108 --> 26:12.904
This is meant to be very meaningful.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.449
The bird fights its way out of the egg.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.244
The egg is the whole world.

26:19.911 --> 26:20.787
Raemian.

26:21.454 --> 26:23.290
Seon-a was reading their work.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.668
That bird can't fight its way out.

26:26.751 --> 26:27.961
You've gone and boiled it.

26:28.461 --> 26:31.548
Also, Raemian is an apartment.
The book is called <i>Demian.</i>

26:35.135 --> 26:37.554
It didn't boil. I baked it in the oven.

26:37.637 --> 26:41.391
Am I not allowed to get a little…
Just, like, a little emotional here?

26:44.853 --> 26:47.606
Ow! I had a bruise there!

26:50.859 --> 26:52.611
It's gonna bruise again.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.448
<i>My dear beloved…</i>

26:57.032 --> 26:59.075
never seek revenge yourselves,

26:59.576 --> 27:01.328
but leave it to God's wrath.

27:02.037 --> 27:06.041
"Vengeance is mine
and I will repay," says the Lord.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.417
Amen.

27:07.500 --> 27:13.465
Let us pray together as we remember
the Lord's own words from Romans 12:19.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.549
Let us pray.

27:16.051 --> 27:19.137
Beloved Father, we truly adore you.

27:19.804 --> 27:23.058
You always embrace us with love,
though we are not deserving.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.644
Allow us to thank you
again for this moment.

27:26.144 --> 27:30.023
Our Lord has always told us
to love our enemies.

27:30.523 --> 27:35.236
But how many times have we tried
to really love and help our enemies?

27:35.737 --> 27:39.949
We have failed to live by your word
and have held grudges against them.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.869
We pray now that you will forgive us.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.959
What's a shitty person like you
doing in a holy place like this?

27:51.044 --> 27:54.714
Sa-ra, I'm genuinely curious,
so let me ask you.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.551
Do you… you honestly believe in God?

27:59.552 --> 28:00.387
Seriously, you?

28:01.179 --> 28:04.349
What you just said… Blasphemy.

28:04.432 --> 28:07.102
Repent. Or you'll suffer God's wrath.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.229
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.406
Mmm. I just happened to pray
and made a pact with God.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.157
He's okay with it.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.744
You're crossing the line, you bitch.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.831
You don't give a shit
about anything as an adult?

28:27.914 --> 28:29.290
Don't do that in here.

28:29.916 --> 28:32.085
Don't use that language in a house of God.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.586
Just hang on.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.093
That's not good.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.057
Your God is super pissed right now.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.728
He says you're going to Hell.

28:49.811 --> 28:50.812
Hey!

28:51.980 --> 28:53.732
Have you lost your shit? Are you on drugs?

28:53.815 --> 28:55.650
You're the one on drugs here.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.485
Pretty often, no?

28:57.569 --> 28:58.611
That's you.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.574
What're you talking about?

29:05.744 --> 29:06.870
You have 15 days.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.415
Fill that with cash and wait
for my message. I want them in dollars.

29:10.498 --> 29:11.332
Hey!

29:11.916 --> 29:14.127
Making a threat like that
is against the law.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.797
Do you have a clue,
how many police officers go here?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.841
You've never been bullied, have you?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.510
Ah! Stop! Let me go!

29:29.642 --> 29:30.477
Ah, shit!

29:30.560 --> 29:35.774
I haven't even started
with you yet, Sa-ra.

29:45.533 --> 29:49.120
<i>Turn left at the intersection</i>
<i>at University of Education Park.</i>

29:50.663 --> 29:53.416
GYODAE PARK

30:28.785 --> 30:30.203
YEO-JEONG

30:31.037 --> 30:32.413
<i>Did you save my number?</i>

30:32.497 --> 30:35.041
<i>Well, I'll make it easy</i>
<i>for you in case you didn't.</i>

30:35.708 --> 30:37.460
<i>Also, this is Yeo-jeong.</i>

30:47.512 --> 30:49.180
<i>There's supposed to be a heat wave today.</i>

30:49.264 --> 30:50.139
<i>How're you doing?</i>

30:50.640 --> 30:52.267
<i>It's supposed to snow a lot today.</i>

30:52.350 --> 30:54.561
<i>Make sure to be careful so you don't fall.</i>

30:55.061 --> 30:56.145
<i>Stay safe.</i>

30:56.229 --> 30:58.982
<i>Did you see the sky today?</i>
<i>It's crystal clear.</i>

30:59.482 --> 31:01.818
<i>I hope you're doing well</i>
<i>and staying healthy.</i>

31:12.370 --> 31:13.705
CIALIS

31:22.755 --> 31:25.091
TO: SEOUL JOO GENERAL HOSPITAL
JOO YEO-JEONG

31:25.174 --> 31:26.301
FROM: KANG YEONG-CHEON

31:31.431 --> 31:33.349
Yeo-jeong, you got a text.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.608
DONG! EUN! SENT A MESSAGE

31:42.650 --> 31:44.944
-Whoa! Whoa!
-What the… Shit!

31:45.028 --> 31:47.363
I think there's something wrong
with my phone. Look at it.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.824
There's no way she responded
after this long.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.993
I guess we ran into each other that once,

31:52.076 --> 31:53.578
but… but still, she responded?

31:54.495 --> 31:56.247
Maybe she think I looked cool.

31:57.457 --> 32:00.209
Oh, that's it. I get it now. I did.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.837
Is Dong-eun married?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.422
Don't go reading my texts!

32:06.758 --> 32:08.134
Why? What'd she say now?

32:08.217 --> 32:12.096
Uh, is… is it a wedding invite?
She's getting married? To who?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.515
Ah! It's a divorce!

32:15.308 --> 32:16.142
Or remarrying?

32:16.225 --> 32:17.310
Is she remarrying?

32:18.519 --> 32:20.855
She's asking if you know what Cialis is.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.276
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what medicine this is?</i>

32:25.360 --> 32:26.361
DONG! EUN!

32:31.741 --> 32:34.285
-Hey, let's meet up. Where you now?
-You insane?

32:34.369 --> 32:37.413
-The attending will be here soon.
-Ah, not right now.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.248
Where will you be after 7:00?

33:05.775 --> 33:07.777
Sorry to bug you when you're this busy.

33:07.860 --> 33:11.072
I only got busy after your text.
Had to change my on-call.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.455
Have you still been playing Go?

33:20.873 --> 33:22.959
I play for money sometimes.

33:27.046 --> 33:29.799
Living in Seoul still?
Or are you in Semyeong now?

33:31.092 --> 33:32.593
How did you know that?

33:33.177 --> 33:35.930
Back then you said
you weren't living there "just yet."

33:39.475 --> 33:40.560
Moved, right?

33:41.769 --> 33:43.604
Semyeong Elementary is where I work now.

33:47.984 --> 33:50.153
So are you close to that person?

33:50.236 --> 33:52.697
-The one with the medicine.
-No, I'm not yet.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.533
So I guess
they're also a "not yet," huh?

33:59.662 --> 34:02.081
Listen closely.
I'm only gonna say this once.

34:02.665 --> 34:05.418
Cialis is a drug that's based on
something called Tadalafil.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.253
It's got long-lasting effects.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.171
Anything else?

34:08.254 --> 34:12.091
I guess that's good.
This is a product like Viagra, as well.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.509
I know that already.

34:14.510 --> 34:18.431
Could the drug be used for maybe
another purpose other than that?

34:19.640 --> 34:21.976
What kind of other purpose
would you be talking about?

34:23.061 --> 34:25.354
Could it be used
for a different condition?

34:25.938 --> 34:29.817
From what I've heard, some people try it
to cure altitude sickness.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.570
But from a doctor's opinion,

34:32.653 --> 34:35.031
the medication is
for erectile dysfunction only.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.367
Does that man also live in Semyeong?

34:38.451 --> 34:40.078
No. That's not why I asked.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.080
You should meet a guy
that doesn't need that.

34:42.580 --> 34:46.876
As a doctor, I'm a bit concerned.
But you know, as a man, it makes me think.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.546
You've got it wrong.

34:53.883 --> 34:57.303
Mmm. Since I last saw you,
you've gotten ruder.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.472
'Cause you're losing
the argument, I'm wrong?

35:05.228 --> 35:06.604
Did you not know

35:07.939 --> 35:09.690
that it was an excuse to see you?

35:13.236 --> 35:14.237
Yeah. I know that.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.325
You didn't need me when you could've
just looked up what Cialis was for.

35:19.408 --> 35:23.329
But I… didn't know
why you would need an excuse for that.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.581
Got a little too excited.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.001
And although I don't know who he is,

35:29.085 --> 35:31.587
I wonder if this guy has
anything else wrong.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.298
I really hope there's not a single inch
of his body that's healthy.

35:36.717 --> 35:38.469
Just what I thought. Hmm.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.813
I wanted to apologize to you.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.899
What? Apologize?

35:53.192 --> 35:56.070
You see, I don't exactly know
when it happened,

35:57.613 --> 36:01.159
but I was… rude to you.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.496
I'm really sorry if I hurt you.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.134
So, hey,

36:19.135 --> 36:20.469
why does your apology

36:21.637 --> 36:23.389
sound just like a farewell?

36:33.065 --> 36:34.066
This is goodbye.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.945
Gonna tell me to stop texting?

36:40.907 --> 36:42.116
So then why? Huh?

36:42.742 --> 36:45.745
You never respond to me anyways.
You're not interested a little bit?

36:46.412 --> 36:47.413
Fine, then. I'm not.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.832
You're not my type.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.542
Hey, enough now.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.010
I don't know what's going on,

37:02.511 --> 37:05.139
but I don't understand
why you're acting this way.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.266
Right now,

37:08.559 --> 37:10.561
whatever you want to do, just go for it.

37:12.146 --> 37:15.316
But you can date me too.
I know I'll make you happy.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.991
<i>You know those moments?</i>

37:24.700 --> 37:28.454
<i>Those moment in which</i>
<i>you're allowed to like someone.</i>

37:29.664 --> 37:32.041
<i>If moments like those mean you're alive,</i>

37:33.334 --> 37:38.506
<i>then how many days</i>
<i>have I truly lived, Yeon-jin?</i>

37:41.676 --> 37:44.804
Dong-eun, what's so funny?

37:46.555 --> 37:48.266
Guess I'm feeling happy.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.775
But, Yeo-jeong…

37:59.902 --> 38:02.571
I'm not looking for a prince now.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.158
Rather than a prince,

38:07.785 --> 38:12.456
I need an executioner with me,
who can help me in the hunt.

38:25.261 --> 38:29.598
Hang on. They said you'd pass out
after eight seconds. That can't be right.

38:30.099 --> 38:33.019
Come on, she'll pass out
if you hit her hard enough.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.354
If she doesn't, that just means
you're weak as shit.

38:35.438 --> 38:39.525
Come on, hey. Who here got
the high score on the punching machine?

38:40.026 --> 38:42.361
That was all me.

38:44.530 --> 38:47.366
Dong-eun, tell me if it hurts.
I'll pray for you.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.826
Look here. Come on.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.203
Stand straight.
Let's go, Dong-eun.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.582
<i>If I miss, I might hit your boob. </i>

39:20.024 --> 39:24.278
You wanted to talk about
something important at a <i>tteokbokki </i>place,

39:24.362 --> 39:25.946
and you haven't ordered anything yet?

39:28.407 --> 39:31.577
Hey, miss, one <i>tteokbokki</i>
and <i>soondae</i>, please.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.495
Coming.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.623
You eat <i>soondae</i>, right?

39:36.248 --> 39:37.500
You don't cover your tattoo now?

39:37.583 --> 39:40.169
Tattoo? Ah, this one.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.797
No one gives me shit about it now.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.841
You remember we were
in the same Spanish class, right?

39:46.342 --> 39:48.177
I really hated that class, at first.

39:48.803 --> 39:52.306
But then I started liking it again
because of your tattoo.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.434
Wow. You're dumber
than I would've guessed.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.437
This isn't in Spanish. It's in Latin.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.481
Memento mori.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.733
"Remember that you must die."

40:02.817 --> 40:05.778
Well, you used to
only cover up part of it,

40:06.487 --> 40:08.364
and that meant something else in Spanish.

40:08.948 --> 40:09.824
Mean what?

40:17.540 --> 40:18.874
I do eat <i>soondae.</i>

40:20.376 --> 40:21.377
You went to the hospital?

40:22.044 --> 40:22.878
Uh-huh.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.969
Yeah… Looks like you've got something.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.514
So-hee's body was really there.

40:34.140 --> 40:37.893
Yeah. Damn. I don't even know
what the payout would be.

40:37.977 --> 40:41.981
So, who did it?
How much we get will depend on who did it.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.067
-And if I tell you?
-Just say who did it.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.528
Everything else is easy.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.364
I'll grill them about it, day and night.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.283
Make their lives impossible.

40:52.366 --> 40:57.913
I'll turn them all into a huge mess,
then I'll deliver them straight to you.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.668
Okay, so there are four.

41:02.751 --> 41:03.752
Who was it?

41:05.754 --> 41:08.424
<i>Was is Sa-ra? While she was high on drugs?</i>

41:10.176 --> 41:11.010
<i>Or maybe Yeon-jin?</i>

41:12.094 --> 41:13.929
<i>She's the scariest out of them.</i>

41:14.680 --> 41:15.681
<i>Or Hye-jeong?</i>

41:16.182 --> 41:19.727
<i>If So-hee spread the rumor</i>
<i>about Hye-jeong and the gym teacher…</i>

41:20.603 --> 41:21.896
<i>Jae-jun?</i>

41:21.979 --> 41:24.106
<i>Maybe So-hui said something</i>
<i>about his eyes.</i>

41:25.649 --> 41:27.651
But now we're together in the same boat.

41:28.277 --> 41:31.197
Which one of those four killed So-hui?

41:44.668 --> 41:47.463
Dong-eun demanded you give her money?
How much she want?

41:47.546 --> 41:50.382
Don't know. She threw a bag
at me and said to fill it up.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.885
Fuck, that bag is so fucking big! Shit…

41:53.969 --> 41:56.388
-Why didn't you answer your phone?
-When'd you call me?

41:56.472 --> 41:59.141
-Not talking to you.
-So, then you…

41:59.225 --> 42:01.060
Did she not talk to either of you?

42:01.143 --> 42:02.645
It's not money she's after.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.356
I tried to bribe her,
but she didn't want any of it.

42:05.439 --> 42:08.692
Why isn't Myeong-o answering my calls?
You fired him?

42:08.776 --> 42:10.611
He probably doesn't even know
that he got fired.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.821
He's not answering me. Neither will she.

42:12.905 --> 42:16.700
Do you remember what happened
in high school? Anything?

42:16.784 --> 42:19.703
How's Ye-sol doing?
Since you're here, who's watching her?

42:19.787 --> 42:21.914
What did we even do to Dong-eun back then?

42:23.499 --> 42:24.333
Don't know.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.210
She seriously didn't
throw a bag at you two?

42:26.877 --> 42:29.755
Fuck. She watches way too many movies.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.632
Fill it up with dollar bills?! Fuck me.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.717
Ye-sol must be
in elementary school by now.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.636
Where at? Semyeong Elementary?

42:35.719 --> 42:39.807
What is she going to do to us
to make us suffer like her?

42:39.890 --> 42:43.602
I never even got Ye-sol a gift.
Which classroom is she in?

43:03.247 --> 43:06.667
Can you please tell me your destination
and if you'd like a one-way or round trip?

43:06.750 --> 43:09.128
Wow. I've always wanted to try this.

43:10.546 --> 43:13.132
And now, finally, I can.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.389
Vladivostok, one-way.

43:21.181 --> 43:25.477
I have been thinking about you
non-stop, all day long.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.187
Wanna meet up later?

43:28.314 --> 43:29.648
Come on, now. Fuck off.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.234
You wanna see me alone? Why?

43:32.318 --> 43:35.195
Now, I'm curious.
Why do you want to see me?

43:35.279 --> 43:37.364
Who's this? Son Myeong-o?

43:37.448 --> 43:39.533
Motherfucker, where the hell are you?

43:39.617 --> 43:42.119
And Yeon-jin? Set a date with her?

44:03.390 --> 44:04.350
<i>Me…</i>

44:05.851 --> 44:06.685
<i>"I…"</i>

44:12.191 --> 44:13.108
<i>Mori.</i>

44:17.863 --> 44:18.906
<i>"…am dead."</i>
