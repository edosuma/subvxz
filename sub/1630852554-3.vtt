00:03.800 --> 00:05.700
GATES: I'm Henry
Louis Gates, Jr.,

00:05.733 --> 00:08.266
welcome to "Finding Your Roots".

00:08.300 --> 00:10.033
In this episode, we'll meet

00:10.066 --> 00:12.833
activist Brittany
Packnett Cunningham,

00:12.866 --> 00:15.800
and law professor Anita Hill.

00:15.833 --> 00:19.666
Two women who have made profound
sacrifices for social justice,

00:19.700 --> 00:23.066
are about to discover
the ancestors who made

00:23.100 --> 00:26.466
sacrifices for them.

00:27.133 --> 00:29.300
PACKNETT: I didn't even
know that anything was missing

00:29.333 --> 00:33.566
until I realized
what wasn't there.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.666
HILL: It goes to something
deep inside me that feels

00:38.700 --> 00:42.666
like I'm connected.

00:43.233 --> 00:47.133
GATES: To uncover their roots,
we've used every tool available.

00:47.933 --> 00:50.033
Genealogists helped
stitch together the past

00:50.066 --> 00:53.200
from the paper trail their
ancestors left behind.

00:53.533 --> 00:57.500
PACKNETT: Wow!
That is stunning!

00:57.533 --> 01:00.966
GATES: While DNA experts
utilized the latest advances

01:01.000 --> 01:05.600
in genetic analysis to reveal
secrets hundreds of years old.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.333
HILL: Are you kidding?

01:08.366 --> 01:12.400
GATES: And we've compiled
it all into a book of life,

01:12.433 --> 01:15.666
a record of all of
our discoveries.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.733
PACKNETT: Oh my gosh!

01:17.766 --> 01:20.200
So you found my grandfather!

01:20.233 --> 01:24.566
GATES: And a window
into the hidden past.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.600
HILL: It just feels so
good and so important,

01:26.633 --> 01:32.700
it just feels like a
hole has been filled.

01:33.833 --> 01:36.766
PACKNETT: It's like
finding yourself.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.009
GATES: My two guests came to
me with fundamental questions

01:39.033 --> 01:41.433
about their family trees.

01:41.466 --> 01:43.800
In this episode, we're
going to give them the answers

01:43.833 --> 01:47.666
they've been searching for,
using a pioneering combination

01:47.700 --> 01:50.733
of genetics and genealogy.

01:51.066 --> 01:54.566
Along the way, each will meet
ancestors whose identities

01:54.600 --> 01:58.333
they never even imagined,
and each will see themselves,

01:58.366 --> 02:03.033
and our nation's history
in an entirely new light.

02:07.433 --> 02:14.033
(theme music plays).

02:33.433 --> 02:39.866
♪ ♪

02:45.966 --> 02:48.700
GATES: Anita Hill
needs no introduction.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.800
She's a vital part of
our nation's history.

02:52.466 --> 02:56.433
In 1991, when she
testified, reluctantly,

02:56.466 --> 03:00.166
about the sexual harassment
she'd allegedly endured while

03:00.200 --> 03:03.833
working for Supreme Court
nominee Clarence Thomas,

03:03.866 --> 03:07.233
her's was a lone voice,

03:07.266 --> 03:10.000
seemingly calling out
from the wilderness.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.000
HILL: Telling the world

03:12.033 --> 03:15.533
is the most difficult
experience of my life

03:15.566 --> 03:20.733
GATES: Today, she's a feminist
icon, and a hero to generations.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.733
But her story begins
in an unlikely place,

03:25.766 --> 03:28.133
far from the spotlight.

03:30.866 --> 03:35.400
Anita was born in the tiny
town of Okmulgee, Oklahoma,

03:35.433 --> 03:38.333
the youngest of 13 siblings.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.433
Her parents were farmers,
and she was raised without

03:42.466 --> 03:47.333
running water or indoor plumbing
until she was 12 years old.

03:48.966 --> 03:53.466
Even so, she wasn't limited
by her circumstances.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
Quite the opposite.

03:55.533 --> 03:56.700
HILL: It was isolated.

03:56.733 --> 04:00.300
But it didn't feel
isolated. Uh...

04:00.333 --> 04:02.300
GATES: Well, you had siblings.

04:02.333 --> 04:05.933
HILL: I had my siblings,
and my family believed in the

04:05.966 --> 04:07.700
future, and my
mother in particular.

04:07.733 --> 04:10.033
My mother was, you know,
this person who said,

04:10.066 --> 04:13.433
I want to make sure every one
of my children has a chance to

04:13.466 --> 04:16.633
go to college and later in life,

04:16.666 --> 04:18.700
when I was talking
with her about it,

04:18.733 --> 04:22.200
she said, um, it was
because she didn't.

04:22.233 --> 04:26.200
And she really did believe
that in order to prepare for

04:26.233 --> 04:29.433
the future, in a, in a way,
the future that didn't really

04:29.466 --> 04:33.866
exist, it was, you know, just
an imagination of what the

04:33.900 --> 04:38.866
future would be like, she
wanted us to be ready for it

04:38.900 --> 04:41.633
if it happened.

04:41.666 --> 04:45.400
GATES: It's hard to believe
that even Anita's mother could

04:45.433 --> 04:49.266
have imagined the future
that lay in front of her.

04:49.733 --> 04:52.466
In a matter of years,
Anita went from being the

04:52.500 --> 04:54.900
valedictorian of her
local high school,

04:54.933 --> 04:58.100
to a graduate of the
Yale School of Law,

04:58.133 --> 05:02.066
to working at the United States'
Department of Education's

05:02.100 --> 05:04.233
Office for Civil Rights

05:04.266 --> 05:07.133
to sitting down for a grilling

05:07.166 --> 05:11.833
by an all-white, all-male
senate judiciary committee.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.100
At each step, she faced,
and overcame,

05:16.133 --> 05:19.700
seemingly
insurmountable challenges.

05:20.566 --> 05:24.566
But the greatest challenge
of all was yet to come.

05:26.233 --> 05:28.633
Most of the people polled,
regardless of race and gender,

05:28.666 --> 05:31.766
believed that Clarence Thomas
should still be confirmed to

05:31.800 --> 05:35.233
the Supreme Court
after your testimony.

05:35.266 --> 05:38.366
And even Black people,
uh, in the Black community,

05:38.400 --> 05:40.466
like, well, it's a
brother, you know,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.900
we have to defend the brother.

05:42.933 --> 05:44.933
How did that make you feel?

05:44.966 --> 05:48.966
HILL: It hurt to know that
people didn't believe me,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.666
uh, but maybe
it's because I'm a,

05:51.700 --> 05:54.000
somewhat of an
optimist, I was happy that,

05:54.033 --> 05:58.500
um, you know, a
third of the people did.

05:58.533 --> 05:59.733
GATES: Right.

05:59.766 --> 06:04.700
HILL: And, and, I was naïve
about the resistance to this

06:04.733 --> 06:09.000
idea of women, uh, uh,
having these experiences,

06:09.033 --> 06:12.966
and even, even if
they had the experiences,

06:13.000 --> 06:14.600
telling about it.

06:14.633 --> 06:15.833
GATES: Right.

06:15.866 --> 06:18.700
HILL: So, I was
coming up against two,

06:18.733 --> 06:22.800
uh, social pressures,
one to, first of all,

06:22.833 --> 06:24.566
just deny that I had it,

06:24.600 --> 06:27.733
and, and even if I
acknowledged that I had it,

06:27.766 --> 06:30.733
uh, I was supposed to
never tell about it.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.066
And so, even, so,
that, as I said,

06:34.100 --> 06:37.933
well, if a third of
people do believe it,

06:37.966 --> 06:40.733
then that's progress.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.533
GATES: Anita's optimism
would prove prescient.

06:44.566 --> 06:47.966
In the decades since she risked
so much to give her testimony,

06:48.000 --> 06:52.466
the world and the workplace
have changed dramatically.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.333
And Anita is now seen as a
harbinger of these changes.

06:57.700 --> 07:00.666
Today she's a
distinguished law professor,

07:00.700 --> 07:04.400
and an outspoken advocate
for a wide range of issues

07:04.433 --> 07:07.366
surrounding racial
and gender equality.

07:09.066 --> 07:14.700
Fittingly, in 2020,
<i>Time
magazine named her one of</i>

07:14.733 --> 07:19.366
the most influential women
of the past century.

07:19.866 --> 07:22.000
Looking back at everything
you've accomplished,

07:22.033 --> 07:24.666
what are you proudest of?

07:24.700 --> 07:28.566
HILL: I, I'm proudest of
staying in the struggle

07:28.600 --> 07:30.733
for 30 years.

07:30.766 --> 07:32.733
I was 35 when I started.

07:32.766 --> 07:36.000
I thought I would give the
issues a couple of years,

07:36.033 --> 07:39.266
and I thought it was gonna
be about sexual harassment,

07:39.300 --> 07:41.133
and it's grown.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.700
I've grown, and grown
in my understanding,

07:43.733 --> 07:50.266
and in my ability to include
more people who are suffering,

07:50.300 --> 07:53.900
and to see beyond,
uh, my own experience,

07:53.933 --> 07:58.300
not just sort of,
uh, to dismiss it,

07:58.333 --> 08:01.833
but to understand how it's
connected to the experiences

08:01.866 --> 08:05.700
that people are having today,
that they need help with.

08:07.233 --> 08:09.466
GATES: Much like
Anita, my second guest,

08:09.500 --> 08:13.300
Brittany Packnett Cunningham,
has devoted her life to the

08:13.333 --> 08:15.366
struggle for equality.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.833
But where Anita has often
worked behind the scenes,

08:18.866 --> 08:21.600
Brittany has been
on the front lines,

08:21.633 --> 08:25.200
as an activist and an organizer.

08:25.233 --> 08:28.600
It's a role she
was born to play.

08:30.933 --> 08:34.100
Growing up, Brittany's
mother was a social worker,

08:34.133 --> 08:35.733
and her father was the pastor of

08:35.766 --> 08:38.633
Central Baptist
Church in St. Louis,

08:38.666 --> 08:42.566
a congregation with deep ties
to the civil rights movement.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.833
Their influence shaped
Brittany to her core.

08:47.866 --> 08:49.900
So you had to go to
church every Sunday?

08:49.933 --> 08:52.200
PACKNETT: Every Sunday,
and then again on Wednesday,

08:52.233 --> 08:54.600
and then again on Saturday,
and then sometimes Tuesdays.

08:54.633 --> 08:55.800
Yes.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.700
GATES: But didn't it
make you want to rebel?

08:57.733 --> 09:00.166
I mean, be bad, like
your father was a preacher?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.933
Like go steal some crayons or?

09:02.966 --> 09:05.100
PACKNETT: No.

09:05.133 --> 09:09.933
But I, I think what I remember
so much was that it made me

09:09.966 --> 09:11.800
want to be committed.

09:11.833 --> 09:16.000
I think even at a young age
it gave me a lot of excitement

09:16.033 --> 09:21.500
and curiosity and
desire to just dive in.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.633
GATES: Brittany's desire to
"commit" came to a head at

09:25.666 --> 09:28.666
a pivotal moment in our
country's long troubled

09:28.700 --> 09:30.500
racial history.

09:30.533 --> 09:34.733
On August 9, 2014,
Michael Brown,

09:34.766 --> 09:38.766
an unarmed teenager, was
killed by a police officer

09:38.800 --> 09:40.966
in Ferguson, Missouri,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.533
just miles from Brittany's
childhood home.

09:44.566 --> 09:48.033
Brittany was on a trip to
Kansas City with her mother

09:48.066 --> 09:52.766
when she heard the news that
would forever change her life.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.866
PACKNETT: I got on Instagram
and I saw a picture of a man

09:57.900 --> 09:59.833
holding up a cardboard
sign that said

09:59.866 --> 10:03.500
Ferguson Police Department
just killed my unarmed son.

10:03.533 --> 10:04.833
GATES: Mm.

10:04.866 --> 10:06.942
PACKNETT: It turned out it
was Michael Brown's stepdad,

10:06.966 --> 10:11.133
and I was like,
Ferguson, Missouri?

10:11.166 --> 10:13.600
Like, from the crib?
Down the street?

10:13.633 --> 10:15.200
Ferguson, Ferguson?

10:15.233 --> 10:17.533
Like, where Miss Patrice
used to braid my hair?

10:17.566 --> 10:19.500
That Ferguson?
Wait a minute.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.466
So then I got on Twitter
because the news wasn't

10:21.500 --> 10:22.766
saying anything about it.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.533
I got on Twitter and
started to see more.

10:24.566 --> 10:27.333
And I said to my mom, I said,
I said, "we have to go."

10:27.366 --> 10:28.433
GATES: Mm.

10:28.466 --> 10:29.509
PACKNETT: I said, "I don't
exactly know where we're

10:29.533 --> 10:31.000
walking back home to."

10:31.033 --> 10:32.109
She said, "well, is there
a meeting you're being

10:32.133 --> 10:32.933
asked to come to?"

10:32.966 --> 10:33.900
I said, "no."

10:33.933 --> 10:35.009
I said, "I don't know,
but I just know I need,

10:35.033 --> 10:36.133
we need to be home."

10:36.166 --> 10:36.966
GATES: Mm-hmm.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.533
PACKNETT: And I
need to be there.

10:38.566 --> 10:40.166
GATES: In the wake
of Brown's murder,

10:40.200 --> 10:43.733
Brittany became heavily
involved in the demonstrations

10:43.766 --> 10:47.300
of the burgeoning
Black Lives Matter movement.

10:47.900 --> 10:51.200
Shortly thereafter, she was
named to President Obama's

10:51.233 --> 10:55.133
task force for 21st
century policing.

10:55.166 --> 10:59.700
And in 2015, she
co-founded Campaign Zero,

10:59.733 --> 11:02.666
with the goal of
eliminating police violence

11:02.700 --> 11:06.033
in the United States.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.466
It's a goal that we have not
yet come close to meeting,

11:09.500 --> 11:13.033
but Brittany remains undeterred.

11:13.533 --> 11:17.766
PACKNETT: We know from data
that other nations similar to

11:17.800 --> 11:20.800
ours in size and scope
and history and wealth,

11:20.833 --> 11:24.633
um, are able to not
kill anybody by police.

11:24.666 --> 11:25.976
GATES: It doesn't
have to be this way.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.476
PACKNETT: It actually does
not have to be this way.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.733
GATES: No.

11:28.766 --> 11:31.133
PACKNETT: Um, the good news
is there are people throughout

11:31.166 --> 11:33.866
history who have seen things
as they can be and not as they

11:33.900 --> 11:35.900
are, and then went
and created them.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.033
GATES: Mm-hmm.

11:37.066 --> 11:38.809
PACKNETT: And that's exactly
what we're trying to do.

11:38.833 --> 11:40.376
GATES: You have to
believe that over time...

11:40.400 --> 11:41.333
PACKNETT: That's right.

11:41.366 --> 11:42.809
GATES: At the arc of
the moral universe...

11:42.833 --> 11:45.233
PACKNETT: It's long, but
it bends toward justice.

11:45.266 --> 11:46.566
GATES: You have
to believe that.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.700
PACKNETT: Yeah. Yeah.

11:48.733 --> 11:50.373
GATES: After spending
time with my guests,

11:50.400 --> 11:53.733
it was clear that Brittany and
Anita had both been shaped by

11:53.766 --> 11:56.166
the values of their families.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.033
Now, each was about to
take a journey that would

11:59.066 --> 12:01.733
dramatically expand
their understanding of those

12:01.766 --> 12:03.700
families, and the origins

12:03.733 --> 12:07.433
of the values that
they had inherited.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.366
We started with
Brittany and her father,

12:11.400 --> 12:15.200
the reverend Ronald
Broadnox Packnett.

12:15.233 --> 12:19.700
Tragically, Ronald passed away
when Brittany was just 12,

12:19.733 --> 12:22.800
and she's still
grappling with his absence,

12:22.833 --> 12:26.500
even as she follows
in his footsteps.

12:26.533 --> 12:29.933
GATES: What do you think he
would make of your choice to

12:29.966 --> 12:33.933
be an activist and the success
you've had as an activist?

12:33.966 --> 12:36.066
PACKNETT: I hope
he'd be proud.

12:36.100 --> 12:40.166
Um, I think he'd
have a lot of opinions.

12:41.366 --> 12:44.333
I think I'd have a backseat
organizer with me at all times

12:44.366 --> 12:46.066
if he were still here.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.433
Um, probably not
backseat, front seat,

12:48.466 --> 12:50.166
to be honest with you.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.400
Um, I think he would be,

12:54.433 --> 13:00.633
I hope that he would
see very clearly

13:00.666 --> 13:05.400
the profound impact
that he had on raising

13:05.433 --> 13:08.300
a free and proud Black girl.

13:10.433 --> 13:14.000
GATES: Though Ronald's
influence on Brittany is clear,

13:14.033 --> 13:17.000
he's also at the center
of a mystery that has

13:17.033 --> 13:20.133
haunted her since her childhood.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.466
Ronald grew up without a father,

13:22.500 --> 13:25.233
and Brittany has long yearned
to learn the identity of her

13:25.266 --> 13:28.366
grandfather, whoever he may be.

13:30.466 --> 13:33.466
PACKNETT: I literally only
know of one story that I heard

13:33.500 --> 13:35.266
my dad tell from the pulpit.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.700
GATES: Mm-hmm.
Can you tell me that?

13:36.733 --> 13:40.966
PACKNETT: He saw his
father, they were estranged,

13:41.000 --> 13:46.866
um, he saw his father standing
on a street corner and he was

13:46.900 --> 13:50.800
inebriated, drunk, and kind of
generally pointing in my dad's

13:50.833 --> 13:52.800
direction and said,
"that's my son."

13:52.833 --> 13:54.033
GATES: Mmm.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.176
PACKNETT: And I don't know if
that's how he found out that

13:55.200 --> 13:57.600
that was his father, but
that's all I ever knew about

13:57.633 --> 13:59.333
my grandfather.

13:59.366 --> 14:01.166
GATES: And what are
you hoping to find out?

14:01.200 --> 14:04.166
PACKNETT: I just want
to know who he was.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.833
Um, my grandmother,
uh, my dad's mom,

14:07.866 --> 14:14.033
Mamie, was a firecracker
and incredibly strong.

14:14.066 --> 14:15.800
GATES: Mm-hmm.

14:15.833 --> 14:19.666
PACKNETT: But I just, I want to
know the other half of my dad.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.333
GATES: To answer
Brittany's questions,

14:22.366 --> 14:26.266
we focused first on this one
story that she had heard

14:26.300 --> 14:28.800
about her grandfather.

14:28.833 --> 14:31.300
It stemmed from a rumor in the
Chicago neighborhood where her

14:31.333 --> 14:34.966
father was born, it
turned out to be false.

14:36.466 --> 14:39.166
Brittany's grandfather was
not a drunk on the street.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.433
But to find out his true
identity would require some

14:42.466 --> 14:45.900
intense DNA detective work.

14:47.866 --> 14:50.833
To start our search, we had
Brittany and her mother take

14:50.866 --> 14:54.966
DNA tests, then we compared
their results with the DNA

14:55.000 --> 14:58.200
of people in
publicly-available databases.

14:58.233 --> 15:01.666
We discovered that Brittany
matched someone who shares

15:01.700 --> 15:05.566
about 7.5% of her DNA,

15:05.600 --> 15:09.400
meaning the two have a
close common ancestor.

15:10.133 --> 15:13.266
An ancestor whose relationship
to Brittany could not be

15:13.300 --> 15:15.800
immediately explained.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.933
What's more, this match did
not share any of Brittany's

15:18.966 --> 15:20.833
mother's DNA.

15:20.866 --> 15:25.000
So the relationship had to
be on her father's side.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.900
PACKNETT: Wow!

15:27.933 --> 15:29.600
GATES: We live for
a moment like this.

15:29.633 --> 15:30.966
We live for a match like this.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.233
PACKNETT: Wow.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.533
GATES: This is the beginning.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.566
That match must be related
to you through your unknown

15:36.600 --> 15:38.566
paternal grandfather.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.700
PACKNETT: Oh my gosh.

15:40.733 --> 15:44.066
Oh my gosh. Okay.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.300
GATES: Could you
please turn the page?

15:47.033 --> 15:50.133
Now, Brittany, based on
the analysis that we did,

15:50.166 --> 15:54.166
we determined that you and
this match are related through

15:54.200 --> 15:59.333
the match's father, a
man named Ronald Coble.

15:59.366 --> 16:02.233
C-o-b-l-e.

16:02.266 --> 16:03.800
Do you see him
there on that tree?

16:03.833 --> 16:05.366
PACKNETT: Yeah.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.400
I've never heard the
Coble name in my life.

16:08.433 --> 16:11.033
GATES: Ronald Coble is
your father's uncle.

16:11.066 --> 16:13.300
PACKNETT: Wow.

16:13.333 --> 16:15.500
GATES: His parents
are listed there,

16:15.533 --> 16:16.900
right above him.

16:16.933 --> 16:20.700
They are your
father's grandparents.

16:20.733 --> 16:23.533
You have just met
your great-grandparents.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.300
PACKNETT: Oh my gosh.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.166
GATES: Would you please
read their names?

16:27.200 --> 16:30.166
PACKNETT: "Adolphus, Adolf,
James Coble, Sr.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.600
Lucille Georgia Daniels."

16:34.433 --> 16:36.033
Wow.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.000
GATES: What's it
like to learn this?

16:38.033 --> 16:41.600
PACKNETT: It's like
finding yourself.

16:44.333 --> 16:49.200
I mean, I had just never even

16:49.233 --> 16:53.700
tried to find any of them.

16:53.733 --> 16:55.333
GATES: Mm-hmm.

16:55.366 --> 16:57.900
PACKNETT: Because
I had no way to.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.100
GATES: Mm-mm.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.709
PACKNETT: And my dad wasn't
here to help me fill any of

17:00.733 --> 17:02.566
the blanks in.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.800
GATES: Right. Mm-hmm.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.609
PACKNETT: And it sounds like he
had plenty of blanks himself.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.766
GATES: Mm-mm.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.500
PACKNETT: Wow.

17:10.233 --> 17:14.200
GATES: We were now very
close to solving the mystery.

17:15.900 --> 17:19.300
Records revealed that Adolphus
and Lucille had two sons.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.133
One of them was
named Ronald Coble,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.166
Brittany's great uncle.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.900
Leading us to an
inescapable conclusion.

17:27.933 --> 17:32.700
This means that Adolphus
and Lucille's other son...

17:32.733 --> 17:34.400
PACKNETT: Is my grandfather.

17:34.433 --> 17:37.233
GATES: Is your father's
father, your grandfather.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.000
Could you please turn the page?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.866
PACKNETT: This is him?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.266
Oh my gosh.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.033
(cries).

17:53.066 --> 17:55.300
What's his name?

17:55.733 --> 17:59.533
GATES: Adolphus James Coble, Jr.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.900
GATES: You are looking
at your grandfather.

18:06.833 --> 18:08.166
PACKNETT: Oh goodness.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.676
GATES: What's it like
to know his name and

18:09.700 --> 18:13.333
to see his face finally
after all these years?

18:14.466 --> 18:18.133
PACKNETT: It is such a gift.

18:20.100 --> 18:24.300
My dad was such a doting father.

18:25.366 --> 18:27.733
My mom always said he
spoiled us too much,

18:27.766 --> 18:30.900
and the older I've gotten I
realize it's because he was

18:30.933 --> 18:33.400
trying to do
everything his dad didn't do.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.600
GATES: Mm-hmm.

18:35.633 --> 18:39.766
PACKNETT: And I wish they
would have known each other.

18:40.633 --> 18:45.566
But I still am, like, so
grateful that he made my dad.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.433
GATES: Brittany's grandfather,
who went by his middle name,

18:50.466 --> 18:54.866
"James", was born
in Texas in 1925.

18:56.133 --> 19:00.166
By 1950, he was married
and living in Los Angeles,

19:00.200 --> 19:03.233
which raised a question:
how did he meet Brittany's

19:03.266 --> 19:06.366
grandmother Mamie Packnett?

19:06.400 --> 19:09.500
Try as we might, we just
couldn't connect the two.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.733
We knew that Mamie gave
birth to Brittany's father in

19:12.766 --> 19:15.133
Chicago in 1951.

19:15.166 --> 19:18.533
But we could find no evidence
that James was anywhere near

19:18.566 --> 19:22.466
Chicago nine months before that.

19:22.500 --> 19:26.400
Then we noticed that Mamie had
at least six siblings living

19:26.433 --> 19:30.500
in Los Angeles at the
time her son was conceived,

19:30.533 --> 19:34.833
and all of them lived in the
same neighborhood as James!

19:35.533 --> 19:39.200
Suggesting that Mamie may well
have met James while visiting

19:39.233 --> 19:41.466
one of her siblings.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.466
PACKNETT: Wow.

19:44.500 --> 19:47.133
This wasn't even a
figment of my imagination.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.500
It's not as though
there was a story there...

19:49.533 --> 19:50.500
GATES: Uh-huh.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.233
PACKNETT: And there
were holes to fill in.

19:52.266 --> 19:53.533
There was no story.

19:53.566 --> 19:54.766
GATES: Mm-hmm.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.142
PACKNETT: Because I did not know
anything about my grandfather,

19:57.166 --> 20:01.100
and so then for the story
to be this dramatic...

20:01.133 --> 20:02.400
GATES: Mm.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.233
PACKNETT: I've got
so many questions.

20:05.266 --> 20:07.733
I don't even know if my
grandmother knew that...

20:07.766 --> 20:08.866
GATES: Mm-hmm.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.266
PACKNETT: That
was my dad's dad.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.800
GATES: Right.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.076
PACKNETT: I don't think my dad
knew that that was his dad.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.300
GATES: Mm-hmm.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.233
PACKNETT: I don't, I wonder if
James knew that my dad existed.

20:19.266 --> 20:20.500
GATES: He might not have.

20:20.533 --> 20:24.466
You know, you could, a party,
one night stand, you know?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.900
You just don't know.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.633
PACKNETT: You
really don't know.

20:27.666 --> 20:30.233
You really don't know.

20:30.266 --> 20:32.233
GATES: But a 70-year-old
mystery has been solved.

20:32.266 --> 20:35.100
PACKNETT: Wow.

20:36.466 --> 20:37.542
GATES: Brittany wanted to know

20:37.566 --> 20:40.166
what happened to
her grandfather.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.000
We found the answer, sadly,
on his death certificate.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.633
PACKNETT: Place of death,
Los Angeles, California.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.366
Informant, Claudia Wallace.

20:50.400 --> 20:56.333
Cause of death, stab wound
of chest with hemorrhage.

20:56.366 --> 20:58.333
Justifiable homicide.

20:58.366 --> 21:01.800
At home during
an altercation."

21:02.200 --> 21:05.200
GATES: Your grandfather was
murdered in his home at the

21:05.233 --> 21:08.533
age of 32 and your father
would have been six years old

21:08.566 --> 21:11.766
at the time, and you
see the informant's name?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.133
PACKNETT: Yes.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.200
GATES: Claudia Wallace?

21:14.233 --> 21:15.100
PACKNETT: Yes.

21:15.133 --> 21:17.133
GATES: That's James' ex-wife.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.633
They had gotten a divorce
five years before this,

21:19.666 --> 21:22.533
but she was clearly
still part of his life.

21:22.566 --> 21:26.766
PACKNETT: Right. 32?

21:26.800 --> 21:29.300
GATES: Mm-hmm. 32.

21:29.333 --> 21:34.000
The family story is that James
allegedly was stabbed with an

21:34.033 --> 21:36.400
ice pick by a
jealous girlfriend.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.366
PACKNETT: Whoa.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.333
I mean, I lost my dad
when I was 12, but

21:40.366 --> 21:44.266
I couldn't imagine him being
taken from me in that way.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.833
GATES: Mm-hmm.

21:45.866 --> 21:46.666
PACKNETT: I'm going to
be thinking about that

21:46.700 --> 21:48.533
for a long time.

21:48.566 --> 21:52.100
I'm going to be thinking about
all of this for a long time.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.700
GATES: There's a
silver lining to this story.

21:56.733 --> 22:00.966
In November of 1950, seven
months before Brittany's

22:01.000 --> 22:05.200
father was born, James Coble
and his wife Claudia had a

22:05.233 --> 22:07.266
daughter named Isis.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.500
She's Brittany's aunt,

22:09.533 --> 22:12.933
and though she
passed away in 2012,

22:12.966 --> 22:16.233
she left behind
a daughter of her own,

22:16.266 --> 22:18.333
Morgan Coble-Garrett,

22:18.366 --> 22:22.100
and Morgan is very
much alive today.

22:24.366 --> 22:27.433
She is your half first cousin.

22:27.466 --> 22:29.800
PACKNETT: Oh my gosh.

22:29.833 --> 22:32.233
GATES: Did it ever occur to
you that you had other family

22:32.266 --> 22:33.342
on your father's side of...

22:33.366 --> 22:34.566
PACKNETT: No.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.633
GATES: But you do.

22:35.666 --> 22:38.400
PACKNETT: Never. Oh.

22:38.433 --> 22:40.500
I can't believe this.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.500
GATES: According
to your cousin,

22:42.533 --> 22:43.933
your grandfather was a very

22:43.966 --> 22:45.866
charismatic and intelligent man.

22:45.900 --> 22:46.933
PACKNETT: Wow.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.966
GATES: Which is in such
contrast to this image

22:49.000 --> 22:50.433
your father had, right?

22:50.466 --> 22:51.866
PACKNETT: Yeah.

22:51.900 --> 22:55.466
GATES: So, what's it like
finally to learn this after

22:55.500 --> 22:57.733
all these years?

22:57.766 --> 23:00.533
PACKNETT: It feels like a
picture that's finally

23:00.566 --> 23:02.100
being colored in.

23:02.133 --> 23:03.166
GATES: Mm-hmm.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.966
PACKNETT: Um, he
just went from,

23:05.000 --> 23:08.766
like, a character in
the story to a person.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.233
GATES: Mm-hmm.

23:10.266 --> 23:15.200
PACKNETT: That even through
what sounds like a lot of,

23:15.233 --> 23:18.633
um, complicated
family history...

23:18.666 --> 23:19.833
GATES: Mm-hmm.

23:19.866 --> 23:22.433
PACKNETT: Um, that gave me one
of the most amazing people

23:22.466 --> 23:29.100
I ever knew, and it's just
a real privilege to know,

23:29.133 --> 23:32.200
mm, some of what he
passed on to my dad,

23:32.233 --> 23:35.833
even with their disconnection.

23:37.933 --> 23:40.366
Wow.

23:41.133 --> 23:43.733
GATES: Much like Brittany,
Anita Hill came to me with

23:43.766 --> 23:47.433
questions about an entire
branch of her family tree.

23:49.133 --> 23:53.700
Her mother's parents,
William Elliott and Ida crooks,

23:53.733 --> 23:58.433
died in the 1930s, almost two
decades before Anita was born.

23:59.433 --> 24:02.066
Anita knew little about them
beyond a few anecdotes she

24:02.100 --> 24:04.533
heard from her mother.

24:06.033 --> 24:09.133
We picked up their story in
Little River County, Arkansas,

24:09.166 --> 24:14.133
where, in 1895 William applied
for a homestead grant.

24:15.466 --> 24:17.733
These grants were
not given freely,

24:17.766 --> 24:20.666
it took hard work to get them.

24:20.700 --> 24:24.200
But ultimately William
satisfied the many arduous

24:24.233 --> 24:26.733
requirements that the
federal government

24:26.766 --> 24:29.033
demanded of homesteaders,

24:29.066 --> 24:33.600
allowing Anita's grandparents
to own their own farm.

24:34.300 --> 24:38.266
An extraordinary feat for
African Americans at this time.

24:39.033 --> 24:41.100
What's it like to see that?

24:41.133 --> 24:44.533
HILL: I, I'm just, I'm
so proud that he

24:44.566 --> 24:48.433
and my grandmother
took a chance.

24:48.466 --> 24:52.266
And um, they went
through the process.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.133
Not everybody did that.

24:54.166 --> 24:56.766
GATES: Not everybody
who tried was successful.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.000
HILL: Absolutely.

24:58.033 --> 25:00.133
People who tried,
some people failed,

25:00.166 --> 25:01.700
because there were requirements.

25:01.733 --> 25:03.266
You couldn't just sit on a land.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.266
You had to actually
improve the land.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.366
You had to build on it,
and they did what it took,

25:09.400 --> 25:14.833
uh, which had to be very,
very, very difficult.

25:14.866 --> 25:19.033
Um, so, you know, this
makes me feel so

25:19.066 --> 25:20.866
proud, and it also,

25:20.900 --> 25:24.166
in an odd way, it makes me
just feel proud to know that

25:24.200 --> 25:26.133
his life has been documented.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.333
GATES: Mm-mm.

25:27.366 --> 25:31.766
HILL: And that they have a
record that my grandfather and

25:31.800 --> 25:33.133
grandmother existed,

25:33.166 --> 25:35.500
even though her name's not
on here, that they...

25:35.533 --> 25:36.500
GATES: Of course.

25:36.533 --> 25:40.300
HILL: Existed, and, and
that they really sort of

25:40.333 --> 25:42.700
grabbed this part
of citizenship,

25:42.733 --> 25:47.566
as a right that they
had, and they owned it.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.566
They took it.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.333
GATES: Anita's grandparent's
accomplishment is all the more

25:52.366 --> 25:56.133
impressive given
where it occurred.

25:56.166 --> 25:59.033
Just three years before they
were awarded their homestead,

25:59.066 --> 26:02.900
Little River County was
consumed by a campaign of

26:02.933 --> 26:07.000
racial terror in which armed
parties of white men scoured

26:07.033 --> 26:10.833
the countryside,
murdering African Americans,

26:10.866 --> 26:14.700
supposedly as retribution for
the killing of a white planter.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.633
Violence of this type
was not uncommon in

26:18.666 --> 26:20.600
the Jim Crow south.

26:20.633 --> 26:23.966
But, even so, the
details were shocking.

26:26.833 --> 26:28.800
HILL: "three more dead
negroes have been found in

26:28.833 --> 26:32.700
Red River Bottoms
between New Boston, Texas,

26:32.733 --> 26:35.433
and Rocky Comfort, Arkansas,

26:35.466 --> 26:39.900
two of them, having been
hanged or shot to death.

26:39.933 --> 26:43.566
The third body was stripped
entirely nude when found.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.933
A negro who arrived here today,

26:45.966 --> 26:49.866
says that every negro in the
neighborhood of Rocky Comfort

26:49.900 --> 26:54.666
and Richmond has left his
home and is afraid to return."

26:54.700 --> 26:57.433
GATES: This article reported
on what is now known as the

26:57.466 --> 26:59.633
Little River County race war.

26:59.666 --> 27:02.166
Can you imagine
living through this?

27:02.200 --> 27:06.500
HILL: Well, and New Boston is
where my grandmother was from,

27:06.533 --> 27:11.466
uh, and she had had
a brother who died.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.666
GATES: Danny.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.666
HILL: Yeah,
Danny, who died, uh,

27:14.700 --> 27:18.000
because of a land
dispute with a white person,

27:18.033 --> 27:19.500
he was murdered.

27:19.533 --> 27:24.033
And so, to have that
really in your backyard,

27:24.066 --> 27:27.200
and to be so close to it
personally in your life.

27:27.233 --> 27:28.266
GATES: Mm-mm.

27:28.300 --> 27:33.933
HILL: I just wonder if
they ever lost that fear.

27:35.766 --> 27:38.466
GATES: Unfortunately, Anita's
grandparents would soon be

27:38.500 --> 27:41.533
faced with a
terrible new problem.

27:41.566 --> 27:43.833
As they struggled
to run their farm,

27:43.866 --> 27:47.100
they fell into debt, and
became heavily mortgaged to a

27:47.133 --> 27:51.600
local constable, a white
man named Ernest Hale.

27:53.366 --> 27:57.366
By 1915, the value of the
Elliott farm was well below

27:57.400 --> 28:01.466
the cost of their debts, so
they sold their property to

28:01.500 --> 28:04.900
Hale and moved to Oklahoma.

28:05.633 --> 28:09.833
It was a decision that could
not have been made lightly,

28:09.866 --> 28:12.033
but it paid off.

28:13.133 --> 28:16.600
The family took root
in their new home.

28:16.633 --> 28:18.933
Anita herself would be born
in Oklahoma more than

28:18.966 --> 28:21.700
three decades later.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.100
Leading her to reflect
on her grandparents'

28:24.133 --> 28:26.700
immense tenacity.

28:26.733 --> 28:28.933
HILL: I think you know,
for some people,

28:28.966 --> 28:32.433
it could've just been,
this is so painful,

28:32.466 --> 28:35.833
and it could have stopped
them dead in their tracks,

28:35.866 --> 28:39.966
but they moved on.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.366
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.100
HILL: It was just, they
wanted something better,

28:44.133 --> 28:46.966
and they knew they were
never gonna get a fair shake,

28:47.000 --> 28:48.766
um, where they were and,

28:48.800 --> 28:51.666
you know, they picked up and
moved hundreds of miles away,

28:51.700 --> 28:55.033
um, to start all over again.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.866
They weren't, you
know, children,

28:57.900 --> 28:59.200
even, at that point.

28:59.233 --> 29:00.333
GATES: No.

29:00.366 --> 29:02.376
HILL: You know, they were
a middle-aged couple with,

29:02.400 --> 29:05.400
with small children,
but they moved.

29:05.433 --> 29:06.500
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

29:06.533 --> 29:08.733
HILL: And maybe that's the
only way that they were

29:08.766 --> 29:11.033
able to survive.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.633
GATES: In the end, William
and Ida secured their family's

29:14.666 --> 29:17.700
safety and
security with this move,

29:17.733 --> 29:22.500
but in the process, they left
their family's history behind.

29:22.533 --> 29:24.766
Indeed, Anita knew almost
nothing about her

29:24.800 --> 29:27.700
maternal roots beyond
her grandparents.

29:27.733 --> 29:31.666
Happily, we were able to
reconstruct those roots,

29:31.700 --> 29:34.933
through the use of DNA.

29:35.566 --> 29:39.100
We noticed that Anita
shares DNA with many people in

29:39.133 --> 29:43.200
publicly available databases,
all of whom trace back to

29:43.233 --> 29:49.000
one couple, and we found
that couple in the 1870 census,

29:49.033 --> 29:52.200
living in Bowie County, Texas.

29:52.233 --> 29:54.333
Could you please
read their names?

29:54.366 --> 29:57.700
HILL: Grandison
Lewis and Penny.

29:57.733 --> 30:00.166
GATES: Have you ever
heard those names before?

30:00.200 --> 30:02.300
Grandison? Penny?
Or the surname Lewis?

30:02.333 --> 30:03.700
HILL: No.

30:03.733 --> 30:06.333
GATES: Well, Anita, based
on the genetic evidence,

30:06.366 --> 30:09.966
we believe that Grandison and
Penny Lewis are likely one set

30:10.000 --> 30:13.600
of Ida's grandparents,
which makes them your

30:13.633 --> 30:15.800
great-great-grandparents.

30:15.833 --> 30:19.400
HILL: Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.

30:19.433 --> 30:21.733
GATES: What's it
like to see that?

30:21.766 --> 30:24.500
HILL: I can't
explain it, but it

30:24.533 --> 30:28.966
it really just goes to
something deep inside me

30:29.000 --> 30:34.133
that feels like I'm connected.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.700
I mean, a real
feeling of connection,

30:36.733 --> 30:38.700
and before it's
all been abstract,

30:38.733 --> 30:41.366
and I have a name
and a location...

30:41.400 --> 30:42.433
GATES: Yeah.

30:42.466 --> 30:44.300
HILL: And, and
where they were.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.000
I didn't know
where, where they were.

30:46.033 --> 30:47.433
GATES: Right.

30:47.466 --> 30:50.733
HILL: It's wonderful.
It, it really is wonderful.

30:52.266 --> 30:54.642
GATES: We'd already identified
Brittany Packnett Cunningham's

30:54.666 --> 30:59.166
grandfather, James Coble,
introducing her to an entire

30:59.200 --> 31:01.100
branch of her family tree

31:01.133 --> 31:04.000
that she'd never even
heard of before.

31:04.033 --> 31:06.100
And we were just
getting started!

31:08.300 --> 31:11.800
James's grandmother, Brittany's
great-great-grandmother,

31:11.833 --> 31:14.733
was a woman named
Hartense Hayes.

31:14.766 --> 31:18.966
And tracing her roots led us
to the 1870 census for

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Lincoln County, Tennessee,

31:22.033 --> 31:25.466
here we found Hartense's father,
Lafayette Hayes,

31:25.500 --> 31:28.000
and his seven siblings,

31:28.033 --> 31:31.800
living with their parents,
Newman and Mary.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.800
You are back to your great-
great-great-great-grandparents

31:36.833 --> 31:38.366
on your father's line.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.666
PACKNETT: Goodness. Goodness.

31:40.700 --> 31:43.466
GATES: You just met
three more generations.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.442
PACKNETT: From a family I
didn't even know existed.

31:45.466 --> 31:48.933
GATES: From your, no, and from
whom you have inherited DNA.

31:48.966 --> 31:50.833
These are your, this
is your biological kin.

31:50.866 --> 31:53.900
PACKNETT: Wow.
This is incredible.

31:53.933 --> 31:58.300
It just means something
different to go from saying

31:58.333 --> 32:02.000
our ancestors, my ancestors,
my elders, our elders...

32:02.033 --> 32:03.166
GATES: Yeah.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.000
PACKNETT: To saying Lafayette
and Hartense and James.

32:06.033 --> 32:08.033
Wow.

32:08.066 --> 32:10.000
GATES: And your
father descends from them.

32:10.033 --> 32:11.809
PACKNETT: He's looking down
from heaven right now going,

32:11.833 --> 32:14.033
oh, so that's who my people are.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.600
Wow.

32:17.633 --> 32:20.000
GATES: This census
indicates that Brittany's

32:20.033 --> 32:23.866
third great-grandfather
Lafayette was born in Tennessee

32:23.900 --> 32:26.400
in 1861,

32:26.433 --> 32:29.500
meaning that he and his
parents and elder siblings

32:29.533 --> 32:33.466
were almost
certainly born into slavery.

32:34.800 --> 32:38.700
We now set out to see
how they experienced

32:38.733 --> 32:41.666
this terrible time.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.500
We suspect they were all forced
to work in the fields,

32:44.533 --> 32:48.833
likely on a small farm,
but we aren't certain.

32:48.866 --> 32:53.100
What we do know is
that in early 1864,

32:53.133 --> 32:55.700
with the Civil War raging,

32:55.733 --> 32:57.600
they were freed

32:57.633 --> 33:00.866
as the Union army
occupied Tennessee.

33:01.766 --> 33:04.600
And, at that point, two of
Brittany's relatives did

33:04.633 --> 33:06.566
something remarkable.

33:06.600 --> 33:10.666
Muster rolls show that
Lafayette's older brothers,

33:10.700 --> 33:14.633
Ebenezer and James P. Hayes,

33:14.666 --> 33:17.100
joined the Union army.

33:17.133 --> 33:20.900
PACKNETT: I had no idea.

33:21.966 --> 33:23.300
Whew.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.709
GATES: Your third
great-grandfather Lafayette

33:24.733 --> 33:27.433
was too young to serve, but
his brothers served in the

33:27.466 --> 33:29.833
United States Colored Troops.

33:29.866 --> 33:32.866
What's it like to see that?

33:32.900 --> 33:37.000
PACKNETT: I mean, I'm,
I'm both proud and angry.

33:37.033 --> 33:38.566
GATES: Mm-hmm,
why are you angry?

33:38.600 --> 33:41.633
PACKNETT: I'm angry that they
had to step up to fight for

33:41.666 --> 33:45.433
freedom that belongs to them.

33:45.466 --> 33:46.766
GATES: Mm-hmm.

33:46.800 --> 33:50.733
PACKNETT: And I'm incredibly
proud that, to know that

33:50.766 --> 33:54.066
I come from people
who run toward the fight.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.866
GATES: James and Ebenezer
volunteered on

33:57.900 --> 34:03.200
February 13th, 1864
in Pulaski, Tennessee.

34:04.033 --> 34:07.366
Both men were assigned to
the 111th regiment of

34:07.400 --> 34:09.566
the United States
Colored Troops,

34:09.600 --> 34:13.433
which was almost immediately
thrown into battle,

34:13.466 --> 34:16.133
moving south from
Tennessee into the

34:16.166 --> 34:18.566
heart of the Confederacy.

34:18.600 --> 34:22.966
It must have been thrilling
to bear arms against slavery,

34:23.000 --> 34:28.033
but this story was about
to take a tragic turn.

34:29.766 --> 34:34.866
The 111th would be
ravaged by the war.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.633
Ebenezer died in an army
hospital just months after

34:38.666 --> 34:44.266
enlisting, in May of 1864,
at Athens, Alabama.

34:48.766 --> 34:50.966
PACKNETT: He signed up
for freedom he never got.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.666
GATES: Mm.

34:52.700 --> 34:57.300
PACKNETT: I mean, that is...

34:57.333 --> 35:02.733
Courage that my generation has

35:02.766 --> 35:07.600
thankfully never been asked to
display at that level because

35:07.633 --> 35:11.033
other generations did,

35:11.066 --> 35:15.633
and yet and still the profound

35:15.666 --> 35:20.100
unfairness of it
all is striking.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.400
GATES: And think about this,
remember Ebenezer and his

35:24.433 --> 35:26.200
brother were in
the same regiment.

35:26.233 --> 35:27.400
PACKNETT: Right. Right.

35:27.433 --> 35:30.400
GATES: The 111th, so James
was almost certainly in Athens

35:30.433 --> 35:31.766
when his brother died.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.100
PACKNETT: Mm. Mm.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.209
GATES: Can you imagine what that
must have been like for him?

35:35.233 --> 35:37.166
PACKNETT: I can't, honestly.

35:37.200 --> 35:41.466
I mean, it's, I don't know
how you prepare yourself

35:41.500 --> 35:43.300
for something like that.

35:43.333 --> 35:44.266
GATES: Mm.

35:44.300 --> 35:46.266
PACKNETT: Or how you
make sense of it ever.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.433
I mean, enslavement
is unnatural, right?

35:49.466 --> 35:50.666
GATES: Totally.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.200
PACKNETT: So then you
lose your brother

35:53.233 --> 35:58.200
fighting alongside
him for freedom.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.033
There's no possible way
this ever just made sense.

36:03.066 --> 36:06.666
GATES: James had little
time to process his loss.

36:07.133 --> 36:11.200
In September of 1864,
Athens, Alabama,

36:11.233 --> 36:14.433
was attacked by
Confederate forces led by

36:14.466 --> 36:18.933
Nathan Bedford Forrest,
a ruthless cavalry general,

36:18.966 --> 36:22.366
and a notorious racist.

36:22.400 --> 36:26.066
Just months earlier, forrest
had overseen the massacre of

36:26.100 --> 36:29.700
Black troops following the
surrender of Union forces at

36:29.733 --> 36:32.333
Fort Pillow, Tennessee.

36:32.366 --> 36:36.466
After the war, he'd help
found the Ku Klux Klan.

36:36.500 --> 36:42.633
And now, Brittany's relative
was in his crosshairs.

36:43.866 --> 36:48.066
A newspaper from the era
tells us what happened next.

36:49.133 --> 36:52.966
PACKNETT: "Forrest,
the hero of Fort Pillow,

36:53.000 --> 36:56.966
arrived at Athens, Alabama
with a force estimated at

36:57.000 --> 37:00.900
4,000 and captured the
post which was one of the

37:00.933 --> 37:03.000
strongest in the district.

37:03.033 --> 37:04.933
The post had portions of the

37:04.966 --> 37:08.266
111th United States
Colored Troops.

37:08.300 --> 37:11.400
We have no details of the
surrender and do not know

37:11.433 --> 37:14.666
what resistance,
if any, was made."

37:14.700 --> 37:17.066
Wow.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.666
I just wonder, was he scared?

37:18.700 --> 37:22.066
Was he angry?
Was he determined?

37:22.100 --> 37:24.233
Was he fed up?

37:24.266 --> 37:29.766
I just, I can't imagine,
I can't imagine.

37:31.566 --> 37:34.400
GATES: Unlike at Fort Pillow,
forrest spared the

37:34.433 --> 37:37.133
Black soldiers he
captured in Athens,

37:37.166 --> 37:40.000
so James was sent to a
Confederate prison camp

37:40.033 --> 37:42.466
in Meridian, Mississippi.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.300
The end of the war was looming,

37:44.333 --> 37:46.933
and he and his family must
have hoped he would survive to

37:46.966 --> 37:51.033
see it, but those
hopes were dashed.

37:52.233 --> 37:56.433
PACKNETT: "James P Hayes.
February 16, 1865.

37:56.466 --> 38:00.133
Meridian, Mississippi.
Died while a prisoner of war.

38:00.166 --> 38:04.500
Cause, bad
treatment of the enemy."

38:04.533 --> 38:07.533
Wow.

38:07.566 --> 38:11.466
He did all that just
for it to kill him.

38:11.500 --> 38:15.000
GATES: The Confederacy treated
prisoners of war abysmally,

38:15.033 --> 38:17.033
and particularly Black
prisoners of war.

38:17.066 --> 38:18.300
PACKNETT: Yeah.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.676
GATES: They endured
cramped living quarters,

38:19.700 --> 38:20.833
rampant disease.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.633
Some were also put to
work, re-enslavement.

38:23.666 --> 38:26.466
And we know that prisoners
from the 111th were used for

38:26.500 --> 38:30.366
hard labor to build railway
lines and fortifications.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.666
PACKNETT: Hmm.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.633
GATES: James and Ebenezer,
your blood relatives,

38:33.666 --> 38:38.300
made the ultimate sacrifice
for your freedom and mine.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.800
PACKNETT: A choice they
never should have had to make.

38:40.833 --> 38:41.966
Um.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.700
GATES: No.

38:43.733 --> 38:47.466
PACKNETT: But um, a
brave one indeed.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.109
GATES: What's it been
like to hear their stories?

38:50.133 --> 38:51.966
PACKNETT: Oh, man.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.466
I find myself...

38:56.500 --> 39:01.233
Struck by the cruelty
of our history and

39:01.266 --> 39:05.633
um, wondering what
could have been.

39:06.633 --> 39:10.833
I mean, their lives were very
literally stolen and so is

39:10.866 --> 39:12.966
every other enslaved persons'.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.333
GATES: Mm-hmm.

39:14.366 --> 39:19.566
PACKNETT: And I, often ask
myself to imagine what life is

39:19.600 --> 39:21.166
beyond oppression.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.333
GATES: Mm-hmm.

39:22.366 --> 39:24.733
PACKNETT: So that we know
what we're building toward.

39:24.766 --> 39:26.333
GATES: Mm-hmm.

39:26.366 --> 39:29.333
PACKNETT: And I just
wonder what the answer to that

39:29.366 --> 39:31.366
question would have
looked like for them.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.466
GATES: Mm.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.042
PACKNETT: If they had
made it to the other side.

39:34.066 --> 39:35.166
GATES: Right.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.233
PACKNETT: What was the
kind of life they wanted?

39:38.266 --> 39:40.566
GATES: That they dreamed of.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.566
PACKNETT: Yeah.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.076
GATES: James
and Ebenezer are among the

39:45.100 --> 39:50.266
roughly 40,000 African Americans
who died serving the union.

39:50.933 --> 39:54.533
But their loss was
not entirely in vain.

39:55.566 --> 39:58.333
The brothers were awarded
pensions for their service,

39:58.366 --> 40:01.366
pensions that helped support
their mother and father,

40:01.400 --> 40:03.600
Brittany's fourth
great-grandparents,

40:03.633 --> 40:07.666
as well as their
siblings, into the 1880s,

40:07.700 --> 40:13.500
giving the family a measure of
financial stability that many

40:13.533 --> 40:17.200
newly-freed African Americans
were unable to obtain.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.566
PACKNETT: This is, wow.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.533
GATES: What would your
dad make of all this?

40:26.966 --> 40:29.766
PACKNETT: When he pastored
Central Baptist he used to do

40:29.800 --> 40:31.166
children's story time.

40:31.200 --> 40:32.166
GATES: Mm-hmm.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.100
PACKNETT: Um,
because, you know,

40:34.133 --> 40:38.700
my dad was a liberation
theologian story time would be

40:38.733 --> 40:43.700
a little Bible mixed in with
some social justice and

40:43.733 --> 40:45.166
some Black power.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.376
GATES: And some Black history.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.500
PACKNETT: Yeah.

40:47.533 --> 40:50.333
Um, I have a feeling he
would have mixed

40:50.366 --> 40:51.666
some of these stories in.

40:51.700 --> 40:52.500
GATES: Yeah.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.466
PACKNETT: Yeah.

40:55.666 --> 40:57.966
GATES: We'd already traced
Anita Hill's maternal roots

40:58.000 --> 41:01.033
back to her
great-great-grandfather,

41:01.066 --> 41:05.533
Grandison Lewis, who was born
into slavery and was living in

41:05.566 --> 41:08.666
Bowie County, Texas
when the Civil War ended.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.200
Now we wanted to see if we
could find any evidence of his

41:12.233 --> 41:15.266
life during slavery.

41:15.900 --> 41:18.233
This posed an extremely
difficult challenge

41:18.266 --> 41:20.500
to our genealogists.

41:20.533 --> 41:24.033
Enslaved people were almost
never listed by name in the

41:24.066 --> 41:27.566
federal census because
denying them their names,

41:27.600 --> 41:30.433
a key part of a
person's humanity,

41:30.466 --> 41:32.733
was a way of reinforcing
the fiction that

41:32.766 --> 41:34.633
they were property.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.866
A fundamental part
of the slave system.

41:37.900 --> 41:41.133
But there were a few exceptions.

41:41.566 --> 41:47.266
In 1850, three counties in the
entire United States chose to

41:47.300 --> 41:50.733
record the names
of enslaved people.

41:50.766 --> 41:53.266
Utah County, Utah.

41:53.300 --> 41:55.500
Scott County, Tennessee.

41:55.533 --> 41:59.300
And Bowie County, Texas.

41:59.333 --> 42:01.500
HILL: Wow.

42:01.533 --> 42:03.600
How is that, how,
you know, how does,

42:03.633 --> 42:05.233
I mean, this,
this is, like, the,

42:05.266 --> 42:07.100
winning the lottery here.

42:07.133 --> 42:10.400
GATES: You have won the
genealogical jackpot,

42:10.433 --> 42:14.233
and it's because
some county clerk,

42:14.266 --> 42:20.833
or census-taker decided that
it was important to write down

42:20.866 --> 42:27.266
the names of the enslaved
people on a slave schedule,

42:27.300 --> 42:31.000
but only in three counties
in the whole United States in

42:31.033 --> 42:35.733
1850 did that happen,
and it happened where your

42:35.766 --> 42:38.766
great-great-grandfather
was living,

42:38.800 --> 42:42.833
and that's why you're
able to see his name.

42:42.866 --> 42:44.366
HILL: Oh I love it.
I love it.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.900
GATES: That is a miracle.

42:45.933 --> 42:48.700
HILL: Yeah.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.766
GATES: According
to this census, in 1850,

42:51.800 --> 42:56.100
Grandison was one of 22 people
enslaved by Charles Lewis,

42:56.133 --> 43:00.100
a white farmer who ran a large
plantation in Bowie County.

43:00.966 --> 43:03.900
So Anita now knew the name
of the man who enslaved her

43:03.933 --> 43:08.233
ancestor, prompting some
decidedly mixed emotions.

43:10.366 --> 43:13.766
HILL: In, in some way,
it humanizes him,

43:13.800 --> 43:15.400
but in some ways,

43:15.433 --> 43:19.766
it dehumanizes him to me,
because, you know,

43:19.800 --> 43:25.733
how could you be,
a, a human being who could

43:25.766 --> 43:29.533
just, like, sit
and articulate this,

43:29.566 --> 43:33.700
and own this, and say
that you were owning people,

43:33.733 --> 43:37.800
um, say it out loud
in, in a public document,

43:37.833 --> 43:41.900
and not feel guilty about this?

43:41.933 --> 43:47.233
I think I feel quite a
bit of anger for Charles.

43:47.266 --> 43:49.933
But then, you know, it, it,

43:49.966 --> 43:51.900
the anger can't
be limited to him.

43:51.933 --> 43:52.866
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

43:52.900 --> 43:55.600
HILL: It's a
system that allowed it.

43:55.866 --> 43:58.666
GATES: The system that held
Anita's ancestors in bondage

43:58.700 --> 44:01.133
would soon come to an end.

44:01.166 --> 44:06.466
In May of 1865, the
Union army entered Texas.

44:06.500 --> 44:10.700
By that time, Anita's
great-great-grandparents,

44:10.733 --> 44:15.466
Grandison and Penny Lewis, had
had several children together.

44:16.900 --> 44:19.900
It is hard to imagine the
joy they must have felt to see

44:19.933 --> 44:22.833
freedom finally come.

44:23.766 --> 44:28.266
Unfortunately, they were
about to face a fresh ordeal,

44:28.300 --> 44:33.400
as we saw in a complaint
detailing the abuses that

44:33.433 --> 44:36.966
newly-freed African Americans
in Bowie County suffered

44:37.000 --> 44:41.200
at the hands of a white
planter named Warren Hooks.

44:42.333 --> 44:47.066
HILL: "In July 1865 Warren
Hooks Esquire took my brother

44:47.100 --> 44:50.466
Alex Hooks and took his
pants down and laid him on the

44:50.500 --> 44:54.933
ground and did severely beat
him in my presence with a wide

44:54.966 --> 44:57.500
strap made of leather.

44:57.533 --> 45:02.700
And in the same year and month
he did take one Grandison Lewis,

45:02.733 --> 45:05.500
colored, who was in his employ,

45:05.533 --> 45:09.133
and beat him with a
large ten foot pole and

45:09.166 --> 45:11.633
drew blood from his head.

45:11.666 --> 45:14.500
Because he said Grandison
had not hauled wheat

45:14.533 --> 45:16.666
enough that morning.

45:16.700 --> 45:20.633
In the fall of 1867,
said Warren Hooks,

45:20.666 --> 45:25.600
did hit a colored woman named
Penny Lewis with a grub and

45:25.633 --> 45:31.233
his fist and whipped her
son Spencer, 13 years of age."

45:31.733 --> 45:33.766
GATES: A grub is a hoe.

45:33.800 --> 45:38.366
HILL: Yeah. Wow.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.066
That was terrible.

45:41.100 --> 45:42.833
GATES: Yeah.

45:42.866 --> 45:44.566
And this is three
years after the,

45:44.600 --> 45:48.366
uh, end of slavery, but
they're still being treated

45:48.400 --> 45:50.800
as if they're slaves.

45:50.833 --> 45:53.566
HILL: Slaves.
Like Hooks owned them.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.766
GATES: How do you think your
ancestors responded to this?

45:56.800 --> 45:59.400
They were basically
being terrorized.

45:59.433 --> 46:03.200
HILL: They
probably felt vulnerable,

46:04.033 --> 46:09.166
but maybe, to survive,
they just became numb to it.

46:09.566 --> 46:11.133
GATES: Mmm-hmm.

46:11.166 --> 46:12.900
HILL: I, I, I think
that would've been a,

46:12.933 --> 46:16.700
a natural reaction to
something that you live with

46:16.733 --> 46:19.966
every day, something so brutal
that you live with every day,

46:20.000 --> 46:21.933
but you know you
can't do anything about,

46:21.966 --> 46:24.600
and no one else is
going to do anything.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.900
GATES: Anita's ancestors may
well have been frightened,

46:27.933 --> 46:31.900
but they didn't
give in to those fears.

46:31.933 --> 46:36.033
Quite the contrary:
in the summer of 1867,

46:36.066 --> 46:39.466
despite the
threats all around him,

46:39.500 --> 46:43.233
her great-great-grandfather
Grandison left the relative

46:43.266 --> 46:45.800
safety of his home.

46:45.833 --> 46:48.966
And registered to vote.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.400
HILL: "Bowie County.
Date of registry: July 17.

46:52.433 --> 46:57.533
Names of voters:
Grandison Lewis."

46:59.066 --> 47:01.200
Wow.

47:01.233 --> 47:05.200
So, even in, in, in his despair,

47:05.233 --> 47:09.133
he, he still wanted
to claim his right.

47:09.700 --> 47:15.266
And that's, like,
yeah, that really is,

47:15.300 --> 47:19.400
I mean, that's just a personal
level of personal courage,

47:19.433 --> 47:21.366
to still believe,

47:21.400 --> 47:22.566
GATES: Mm-mm.

47:22.600 --> 47:23.809
HILL: To still believe
that there was

47:23.833 --> 47:26.333
something that you could do,
that something that you could

47:26.366 --> 47:27.800
do would matter.

47:27.833 --> 47:29.466
GATES: Right.

47:29.500 --> 47:30.966
HILL: Wow.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.600
GATES: How does it
feel to see that?

47:32.633 --> 47:37.633
HILL: You know, it the other
part of it is so awful,

47:37.666 --> 47:39.400
and so depressing, and so,

47:39.433 --> 47:42.500
it, it makes me so angry.

47:42.533 --> 47:45.966
But you see this, and
you, you, you realize that

47:46.000 --> 47:49.633
they still
had, had an investment,

47:49.666 --> 47:53.033
that, in, in, in
their own future,

47:53.066 --> 47:56.800
in their own well-being, that
they, they didn't just give up.

47:56.833 --> 47:58.033
GATES: Mm-mm.

47:58.066 --> 48:02.133
HILL: Um, and they still had
a belief in the system.

48:02.166 --> 48:05.566
You know, I don't, I don't
know how they kept that.

48:05.600 --> 48:11.166
I don't know how, um,
given that you were under

48:11.200 --> 48:15.766
physical threat, how do
you look beyond that,

48:15.800 --> 48:21.100
and believe in a system
that really wasn't intended

48:21.133 --> 48:23.133
to protect you?

48:23.166 --> 48:24.466
GATES: No.

48:24.500 --> 48:28.933
But it's obvious that he
believed that if you could vote,

48:28.966 --> 48:32.533
and you voted, you
could change the system.

48:32.566 --> 48:33.500
HILL: Right.

48:33.533 --> 48:34.633
GATES: Incredible.

48:34.666 --> 48:36.933
HILL: Yeah.
How can you still believe?

48:36.966 --> 48:40.333
GATES: As it turns out,
Anita's ancestor was not only

48:40.366 --> 48:44.100
idealistic, he was
supremely pragmatic,

48:44.133 --> 48:47.766
as evidenced by a series of
tax records from Bowie County,

48:47.800 --> 48:52.333
which, taken together,
tell an astonishing story.

48:53.466 --> 48:56.266
HILL: "1889
assessment of property.

48:56.300 --> 48:59.033
Owner: Grandison Lewis.

48:59.066 --> 49:02.766
Original grantee:
Charles Lewis.

49:02.800 --> 49:07.800
Acres: 60.
Value: 120 dollars."

49:07.833 --> 49:09.433
Wow.

49:09.466 --> 49:12.400
GATES: In 1874, nine
years after slavery ended,

49:12.433 --> 49:14.966
your great-great-grandfather
became the owner of

49:15.000 --> 49:17.433
175 acres of land.

49:17.466 --> 49:20.366
15 years later, he
purchased an additional

49:20.400 --> 49:23.966
60 acres of land that was
originally granted to

49:24.000 --> 49:27.266
Charles Lewis, the man
who had once owned him.

49:27.300 --> 49:29.233
HILL: Wow.

49:29.266 --> 49:31.533
GATES: We believe your
ancestor actually purchased

49:31.566 --> 49:35.466
part of the land on which he
had been previously enslaved.

49:35.500 --> 49:38.433
HILL: Ha.
That's some justice.

49:38.466 --> 49:41.133
GATES: What's it
like to see that?

49:41.166 --> 49:46.933
HILL: I just, I, I'm just in
awe of, of the ability and, and

49:46.966 --> 49:50.066
the willingness to, just
to stick in there and keep

49:50.100 --> 49:55.566
pushing for your rights, uh,
and getting what's due to you,

49:55.600 --> 49:58.233
and maybe it wasn't
all that was due,

49:58.266 --> 50:01.833
but you know, you start to
chip away with what has been

50:01.866 --> 50:07.500
taken from you, and you demand
to take some of it back.

50:08.766 --> 50:12.066
GATES: The paper trail had
run out for each of my guests.

50:12.100 --> 50:13.500
PACKNETT: Oh my gosh.

50:13.533 --> 50:16.266
GATES: It was time to
unfurl their family trees.

50:16.300 --> 50:18.200
PACKNETT: This is incredible.

50:18.233 --> 50:21.566
GATES: Now filled with names
they'd never heard before.

50:21.766 --> 50:24.000
PACKNETT: This is my family.

50:24.033 --> 50:26.466
Oh my gosh.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.266
HILL: I know to
some people, you know,

50:28.300 --> 50:29.733
you go back 1,000 years,

50:29.766 --> 50:32.433
to me this is like
going back 1,000 years.

50:32.466 --> 50:33.742
GATES: It is for an
African American.

50:33.766 --> 50:35.433
HILL: Yeah, this is. Great.

50:35.466 --> 50:36.900
Oh, it's wonderful.

50:36.933 --> 50:38.933
Thank you.

50:38.966 --> 50:42.166
GATES: Seeing their ancestors
laid out before them,

50:42.200 --> 50:47.266
stretching back centuries,
allowed each to reflect on the

50:47.300 --> 50:51.466
women and men who had done so
much to lay the groundwork

50:51.500 --> 50:54.533
for their success.

50:54.566 --> 50:56.966
What do you think you've
inherited from these people?

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
HILL: Well, I like to
hope and believe that I've

51:00.033 --> 51:03.733
inherited tenacity,
and, and the,

51:03.766 --> 51:08.266
really the ability
to, to claim citizenship.

51:08.300 --> 51:12.766
And, and what's it's taught me
is that that's a legacy that

51:12.800 --> 51:16.900
I have to continue,
whether it's using your voice,

51:16.933 --> 51:21.966
or whether it's can be
pushing your, your rights.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.133
Um, it's something that I
have now a birthright to,

51:26.166 --> 51:28.566
and that I need to continue.

51:29.866 --> 51:32.700
PACKNETT: Seeing this makes me
feel completely unbreakable.

51:32.733 --> 51:34.333
GATES: What do you mean?

51:34.366 --> 51:36.066
PACKNETT: They survived.

51:36.100 --> 51:37.333
GATES: Mm-hmm.

51:37.366 --> 51:39.200
PACKNETT: They
stayed together.

51:39.233 --> 51:41.566
They birthed generations

51:41.600 --> 51:44.800
that were not supposed
to see the sun.

51:44.833 --> 51:48.966
And it probably doesn't match
the feeling that I thought

51:49.000 --> 51:50.033
I was going to have...

51:50.066 --> 51:51.066
GATES: Mm-hmm.

51:51.100 --> 51:53.533
PACKNETT: But I feel
completely unbreakable.

51:53.566 --> 51:55.733
GATES: That's the end
of our journey with

51:55.766 --> 51:58.800
Brittany Packnett Cunningham
and Anita Hill.

51:58.833 --> 52:01.100
Join me next time

52:01.133 --> 52:04.100
when we unlock the
secrets of the past

52:04.133 --> 52:09.833
for new guests on another
episode of "Finding Your Roots".
