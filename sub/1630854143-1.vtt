00:21.526 --> 00:23.658
<i>Good morning. It's 52 degrees</i>

00:23.693 --> 00:26.023
<i>at nine o'clock</i>
<i>this Tuesday, June 23rd,</i>

00:26.258 --> 00:27.629
<i>and here is our top story.</i>

00:29.094 --> 00:31.028
<i>Tragedy in Knoxville.</i>

00:31.597 --> 00:34.933
<i>Two days ago,</i>
<i>Sunday morning, June 21st,</i>

00:35.302 --> 00:36.704
<i>a lone gunman entered</i>

00:36.739 --> 00:38.838
<i>the Knoxville Baptist</i>
<i>University campus</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:40.246
<i>with rifle in hand.</i>

00:40.781 --> 00:42.875
<i>There, he climbed</i>
<i>the clock tower</i>

00:42.910 --> 00:45.449
<i>and began firing</i>
<i>into the crowds below.</i>

00:46.051 --> 00:49.552
<i>Thirteen are reported dead,</i>
<i>with 26 critically injured.</i>

00:50.221 --> 00:52.126
<i>President Reagan</i>
<i>and the First Lady arrived</i>

00:52.161 --> 00:53.688
<i>in Knoxville this afternoon</i>

00:53.723 --> 00:56.625
<i>to console the grieving families</i>
<i>of the fallen.</i>

00:57.327 --> 00:59.496
<i>Police have yet to release</i>
<i>the identity of the shooter,</i>

00:59.965 --> 01:01.597
<i>but an anonymous source</i>
<i>is reporting</i>

01:01.632 --> 01:03.401
<i>that the suspect in custody is</i>

01:04.096 --> 01:05.667
<i>a 17 year-old boy.</i>

01:06.603 --> 01:08.769
<i>We continue our coverage</i>
<i>on the Knoxville killings</i>

01:08.804 --> 01:10.276
<i>with our very own</i>
<i>Frank Hutchinson,</i>

01:10.311 --> 01:11.772
<i>who is live on the scene.</i>

02:52.974 --> 02:56.041
Uh, this is a message
for William DuKent.

02:57.649 --> 02:59.143
Mr. DuKent. Um...

03:01.884 --> 03:03.224
This is Bruce Cogburn.

03:04.458 --> 03:05.886
I'm calling in response
to the letters

03:05.921 --> 03:07.019
I've received from you.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.923
I'm not sure how you...
you found me.

03:10.859 --> 03:14.400
Perhaps you... you got my PO box
from an old agent or summit.

03:15.931 --> 03:18.338
If so, that information
was never meant to be shared.

03:19.074 --> 03:23.475
Nevertheless, it seems
from your letters, Mr. DuKent,

03:23.510 --> 03:24.740
you know quite a bit about me.

03:25.710 --> 03:26.940
So I can only assume

03:27.475 --> 03:29.514
you're aware of my sentiment
when it comes to

03:29.549 --> 03:30.680
discussing my work.

03:30.982 --> 03:32.715
I don't do interviews.
Never have.

03:33.751 --> 03:34.816
And I never will.

03:39.889 --> 03:40.987
Anyway, I...

03:41.923 --> 03:43.495
I want to wish you
all the best with your book.

03:44.894 --> 03:47.598
The blank page can be
a terrifying prospect at times,

03:47.900 --> 03:49.127
so good luck.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.093
Mr. DuKent,

07:06.128 --> 07:07.963
this is Bruce Cogburn
calling you again.

07:08.498 --> 07:09.998
Every time I make
one of these calls,

07:10.033 --> 07:12.165
I have to travel 14 miles
to the nearest phone booth.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.838
Now, I feel I've been
nothing but courteous

07:14.873 --> 07:15.905
when it comes to your book

07:16.274 --> 07:17.511
and how I have no interest
in helping you with it.

07:18.013 --> 07:19.843
But it seems I'm not
making myself clear.

07:20.111 --> 07:21.339
So, piss off.

07:21.674 --> 07:24.408
Your letters are unsolicited
and constitute harassment,

07:24.443 --> 07:25.981
so please, stop sending them.

07:26.016 --> 07:28.148
In the meantime, I'm going
to get rid of my PO box

07:28.183 --> 07:29.380
so you can save yourself
the bother.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.449
And one more thing.

07:33.318 --> 07:36.662
You keep asking me,
why I never wrote a second book.

07:37.423 --> 07:40.666
21st June. 1981. Knoxville.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.360
But you know that.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.694
- Fuck.

10:53.685 --> 10:54.827
<i>A few days ago,</i>

10:55.062 --> 10:56.653
<i>I received a package</i>
<i>on my doorstep.</i>

10:58.063 --> 10:59.623
<i>It was a box of ink ribbons</i>

10:59.658 --> 11:01.196
<i>for a very specific typewriter.</i>

11:02.133 --> 11:03.836
<i>The one I used</i>
<i>when I wrote my book.</i>

11:04.238 --> 11:06.036
<i>I should tell you that</i>
<i>some of the things</i>

11:06.071 --> 11:07.466
<i>that have been said</i>
<i>about me are true.</i>

11:09.907 --> 11:11.371
<i>For instance, if I find anyone</i>

11:11.406 --> 11:12.878
<i>trespassing on my land...</i>

11:14.511 --> 11:16.013
- <i> that</i>
<i>person will be shot on sight.</i>

11:17.016 --> 11:19.709
<i>That's not a threat.</i>
<i>That's just a fact.</i>

11:21.422 --> 11:24.054
So, stay away from me
and my home

11:24.389 --> 11:26.925
and do not test
the sincerity of my resolve.

11:28.192 --> 11:29.224
God bless America.

11:40.006 --> 11:41.302
Hello. How are you?

11:42.204 --> 11:44.745
I'll take two of those
small bottles as well, thanks.

11:46.309 --> 11:47.407
Yeah.

12:07.902 --> 12:11.497
<i>Zwei, funf, sechs,</i>

12:12.071 --> 12:15.908
<i>sechs, zwei, neun.</i>

12:18.473 --> 12:23.278
<i>Eins, eins, funf, eins.</i>

14:23.697 --> 14:24.762
Saul.

14:26.568 --> 14:28.040
According to the Hebrew Bible,

14:28.275 --> 14:29.734
Saul was the first
king of Israel.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.912
I bet you didn't know that.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.250
And then during the battle
with the Philistines,

14:40.285 --> 14:42.483
King Saul threw himself
on his own sword

14:42.518 --> 14:43.517
to avoid being captured.

14:49.129 --> 14:50.656
Hell of a way to go,
if you ask me.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.644
Saul. Saul!

15:57.725 --> 15:58.823
Are you Bruce Cogburn?

16:01.102 --> 16:03.201
Maybe. Who's that letter from?

16:05.172 --> 16:07.205
Uh... William DuKent.

16:13.246 --> 16:14.311
What if I don't want it?

16:16.381 --> 16:20.548
You could stop by the office,
fill out a few forms?

16:21.217 --> 16:22.649
But I don't have
any on me, so...

16:22.684 --> 16:23.683
Will you put it in that barrel?

16:27.260 --> 16:28.325
You can put them all in there.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.262
All of them?

16:31.858 --> 16:32.857
There'll be more.

16:38.967 --> 16:41.173
- <i> Bruce? Is that you?</i>
Jerry?

16:41.208 --> 16:44.000
<i>How long has it been?</i>

16:44.035 --> 16:45.309
Listen, who have you
been talking to?

16:45.611 --> 16:46.937
- <i> Sorry?</i>

16:47.339 --> 16:48.642
Who else knows where I live?

16:48.910 --> 16:50.842
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

16:50.877 --> 16:52.514
Your accountant, your secretary.

16:52.983 --> 16:54.714
- <i> Bruce, I'm the only one</i>

16:54.749 --> 16:56.947
<i>who knows anything</i>
<i>about you, okay?</i>

16:57.249 --> 16:58.520
<i>Like we agreed.</i>

17:00.227 --> 17:01.292
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

17:01.855 --> 17:02.920
Yeah.

17:04.055 --> 17:06.231
Bloody dandy.
- <i> Okay, good.</i>

17:06.533 --> 17:07.727
<i>Now, I know what</i>
<i>you're going to say,</i>

17:07.762 --> 17:09.135
<i>but just hear me out.</i>

17:09.971 --> 17:11.962
<i>The publishers want</i>
<i>to do a re-release.</i>

17:12.531 --> 17:14.305
<i>A special anniversary edition.</i>

17:14.774 --> 17:16.868
<i>And they're wondering</i>
<i>if you would write a foreword.</i>

17:17.136 --> 17:18.441
<i>Just a few words.</i>

17:18.810 --> 17:21.378
<i>Enough to remind the world</i>
<i>that you still exist.</i>

17:21.713 --> 17:23.941
How many words? For the book.
How many do you need?

17:24.476 --> 17:25.910
<i>Enough to fill a few pages.</i>

17:26.880 --> 17:28.814
I'll think about it.

19:12.221 --> 19:13.259
- <i> You might be</i>

19:14.161 --> 19:16.460
<i>the most persistent</i>
<i>fucking person</i>

19:16.495 --> 19:17.824
<i>I've never even met.</i>

19:20.092 --> 19:22.301
<i>Ninety handwritten letters</i>

19:23.337 --> 19:26.129
<i>in this day and age</i>
<i>is no small task.</i>

19:27.033 --> 19:29.374
<i>However, it has to stop.</i>

19:30.542 --> 19:32.036
I was someone important once.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.874
But that seems to tell
a lot of people

19:35.142 --> 19:36.876
that I am supposed to represent

19:36.911 --> 19:38.548
whatever their
particular fantasy

19:38.583 --> 19:40.044
of a hero is supposed to be.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.650
But, Mr. DuKent?

19:45.524 --> 19:46.853
My opinions...

19:48.120 --> 19:50.989
are my own. Okay?

19:51.024 --> 19:54.399
So, I suggest
you go out into the world...

19:57.228 --> 20:03.067
and you discover for yourself
and you trust your own senses

20:03.369 --> 20:06.378
'cause I'm not here to be
someone's fucking inspiration.

20:08.448 --> 20:09.876
Someone's fucking muse.

20:17.017 --> 20:18.082
Fuck.

20:31.735 --> 20:33.438
What do you suppose...

20:34.738 --> 20:35.836
might be the...

20:38.544 --> 20:41.578
the outstanding characteristic
of humanity?

20:42.009 --> 20:44.042
A, language?

20:44.649 --> 20:46.715
B, tool-making?

20:47.245 --> 20:49.586
Or C, obedience?

20:51.084 --> 20:53.722
'Cause I think
it might be obedience.

20:53.757 --> 20:56.252
We're a fucking social animal,
don't you agree?

20:56.287 --> 20:58.122
We've evolved to get on
with each other.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.333
To agree with each other,
for the most part.

21:00.368 --> 21:02.962
However, we're the only
fucking creature

21:02.997 --> 21:04.634
who displays arrogance

21:04.669 --> 21:07.769
when it comes to our obedience.

21:08.004 --> 21:09.639
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

21:11.940 --> 21:14.743
Here's one for you.
To agree with the flat-Earthers.

21:14.778 --> 21:16.107
The Flat Earth Society.

21:16.342 --> 21:20.485
Straight off the top of my head.
Evidence might point to the fact

21:20.520 --> 21:21.981
of a spherical Earth.

21:22.016 --> 21:24.489
But.... but,
that doesn't fucking mean

21:24.524 --> 21:26.216
the Earth is round. Right?

21:26.484 --> 21:28.922
I mean if you think about it,
most people

21:28.957 --> 21:32.827
have only ever seen the Earth
round in a photograph.

21:32.862 --> 21:34.730
Okay? You, me,

21:34.765 --> 21:38.833
experiences our Earth
every day as flat.

21:38.868 --> 21:39.966
Flat. Flat.

21:40.535 --> 21:42.265
Well, actually it's a bit hilly.

21:43.034 --> 21:45.774
So, maybe I need to stand
for the Hilly Earth Society.

21:48.482 --> 21:50.306
I don't think
those flat-Earthers

21:50.341 --> 21:52.550
have taken it far enough
if you ask me.

21:52.585 --> 21:59.348
Clearly it's flat
and round and hilly

21:59.383 --> 22:01.152
and all the other shapes
as well.

22:11.670 --> 22:12.867
This is Bruce Cogburn

22:12.902 --> 22:14.836
calling again
about the last call.

22:15.641 --> 22:17.201
You need to stop writing...

22:17.436 --> 22:19.379
You need to stop
writing to me, okay?

22:51.402 --> 22:52.445
- Morning.

22:59.685 --> 23:04.457
<i>♪ My old friend, he don't</i>
<i>Think or feel a thing ♪</i>

23:05.126 --> 23:07.955
<i>♪ He asks me</i>
<i>To wear his ring... ♪</i>

23:08.891 --> 23:11.156
There's a few meetings in town
I could point you towards,

23:11.191 --> 23:12.663
Mr. Cogburn,
if you're interested.

23:16.702 --> 23:17.800
No? Okay.

23:19.364 --> 23:20.440
Okay.

23:26.943 --> 23:29.174
I don't have to bring you home,
you do realize that?

23:29.209 --> 23:31.176
We can just as easy
go down to the station

23:31.211 --> 23:32.309
and straighten this out.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.278
What would I be charged with?

23:34.313 --> 23:35.411
Public intoxication.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.556
I was in the telephone box.

23:37.591 --> 23:38.920
On public property you were.

23:42.827 --> 23:45.795
I've heard your name somewhere
before, Mr. Cogburn.

23:47.733 --> 23:48.831
Are you famous?

23:49.600 --> 23:52.296
You're that writer
of<i> The Infernal Machine.</i>

23:52.731 --> 23:55.332
'Cause I remember in high school
them pulling it off the shelves

23:55.634 --> 23:56.773
'cause of Knoxville.

23:57.609 --> 24:00.678
That's you, huh? Cogburn.

24:00.713 --> 24:04.110
In my car. In my car.

24:05.146 --> 24:06.178
That's cool.

24:08.479 --> 24:09.588
That's cool.

24:12.087 --> 24:13.526
Didn't Manson
blame all his murders

24:13.561 --> 24:14.791
on the Rolling Stones?

24:14.826 --> 24:16.320
The Beatles.
- What?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.158
It wasn't the Rolling Stones.
It was the Beatles.

24:19.193 --> 24:20.929
- Right, right.
"Helter Skelter."

24:20.964 --> 24:24.460
Fucking nutjob.
That guy's a fucking nutjob.

24:24.762 --> 24:26.132
Crazy's always looking
for an excuse

24:26.167 --> 24:27.331
to be crazy I guess, you know?

24:27.666 --> 24:31.940
If it's like a... a song,
a talking dog, you know?

24:32.437 --> 24:33.513
A book.

24:34.780 --> 24:40.652
<i>Funf, vier, eins, eins.</i>

24:40.687 --> 24:43.919
<i>Sechs, eins, zehn.</i>

24:46.286 --> 24:51.289
<i>Zwei, eins, eins, eins.</i>

24:55.493 --> 24:56.734
- You like
stock car racing?

24:58.166 --> 24:59.495
Not particularly, no.

24:59.530 --> 25:00.639
- Same, same.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.873
My brother? He's hardcore.

25:05.569 --> 25:07.976
Ten years back,
he had a job cutting tires

25:08.011 --> 25:09.813
for a race team
outside Carson City.

25:09.848 --> 25:11.540
You know? They called
him the Dirt Whisperer

25:11.575 --> 25:12.981
'cause, you know, he could
just look at a track

25:13.016 --> 25:14.719
and know exactly how
to set those tires up.

25:16.019 --> 25:17.183
Last race of the season,
you know,

25:17.218 --> 25:18.657
championship points on the line,

25:19.259 --> 25:20.692
the track is just beyond muddy.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.057
Cars are sliding
all over the place,

25:23.092 --> 25:24.421
and my brother calls his

25:25.090 --> 25:26.863
driver in
to switch out the tires.

25:27.432 --> 25:32.099
And like a dozen laps later,
the back tire blows.

25:32.701 --> 25:34.332
Driver loses control, that's it.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.071
Hits a car, that car hits
another car. So on, so on.

25:37.106 --> 25:39.238
Next thing you know,
four drivers, dead.

25:40.604 --> 25:42.010
So, you know,
they do their investigation,

25:42.045 --> 25:44.342
and they find nothing wrong
with that tire.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.783
It just blew.

25:48.722 --> 25:50.315
Sometimes that just happens
in racing.

25:52.055 --> 25:54.550
What happened to your brother?
- He quit racing.

25:55.352 --> 25:57.828
Spent a few years bouncing
from rehab to rehab.

25:59.590 --> 26:00.996
Now, he's a night manager
at Walmart.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.966
Which is a shame 'cause...

26:05.431 --> 26:06.562
he loved racing.

27:23.707 --> 27:24.717
Who...

27:25.951 --> 27:27.951
am I?

27:28.954 --> 27:30.151
Who am I, really?

27:35.458 --> 27:38.192
That's the question that every
protagonist needs to answer

27:38.227 --> 27:42.625
by the end of their story.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.330
If your hero hasn't reached

27:44.365 --> 27:47.839
some sort of cathartic
realization about who they are

27:47.874 --> 27:50.072
or what they believe in
by the last page...

27:50.607 --> 27:52.877
...then I'm sorry to inform you,
ladies and gents,

27:53.212 --> 27:54.340
you have failed your reader.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.581
- <i> What if I don't</i>
<i>have anything to say?</i>

28:06.222 --> 28:08.090
Then you're not
digging deep enough.

28:13.031 --> 28:14.096
- <i> Dig deep.</i>

28:15.759 --> 28:17.429
<i>The road you construct</i>

28:17.464 --> 28:19.398
<i>for your characters</i>
<i>to travel along,</i>

28:20.033 --> 28:21.939
it shouldn't be paved,
shouldn't be easy.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.206
Because finding out who you are

28:27.012 --> 28:28.077
<i>never is.</i>

28:30.246 --> 28:32.576
- <i> I'm of two minds</i>

28:32.611 --> 28:34.050
<i>when it comes to apologizing.</i>

28:35.020 --> 28:36.118
On the one hand,

28:36.153 --> 28:37.922
life's best lived
looking forward

28:37.957 --> 28:39.616
and not crying
over spilled milk.

28:41.323 --> 28:44.126
And on the other hand,
it does strengthen

28:44.161 --> 28:46.964
a certain kind of integrity
to own up to one's mistakes.

28:47.967 --> 28:51.298
So, on that note, I'm sorry
I told you I'd kill you.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.531
Now, I know I didn't use
those words exactly,

28:53.566 --> 28:55.302
but the insinuation
was certainly there, so.

28:57.108 --> 28:58.206
That being said,

28:58.808 --> 29:01.781
I'd like to offer this gift
in the spirit of contrition.

29:02.982 --> 29:04.641
It's a little blurb
for your book.

29:05.644 --> 29:06.709
Quote.

29:07.244 --> 29:10.086
"William DuKent is a right
royal pain in the ass.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.188
But he does have
a lot of backbone,

29:14.324 --> 29:16.323
which is more than I can say
for the rest of the world.

29:18.426 --> 29:19.458
Bruce Cogburn."

29:20.164 --> 29:21.262
End quote.

29:23.937 --> 29:25.167
And merry Christmas too
if you...

29:25.769 --> 29:27.004
if you believe in
that sort of thing.

29:29.437 --> 29:31.437
Listen, if you fancy a drive,

29:32.836 --> 29:35.804
there's a small café around here
called the Casa Segura.

29:35.839 --> 29:37.113
It's just off the 62.

29:38.512 --> 29:40.281
<i>If you happen to be there</i>
<i>on Friday morning,</i>

29:40.316 --> 29:42.118
<i>say eleven o'clock,</i>

29:42.687 --> 29:43.856
<i>I might just be there too.</i>

29:44.892 --> 29:45.957
<i>Okay.</i>

29:51.360 --> 29:53.833
<i>To save this message, press one.</i>

29:57.938 --> 29:59.267
- <i> Message saved.</i>

30:14.878 --> 30:15.954
Refill?

30:16.550 --> 30:17.714
Yeah, thanks.

31:40.205 --> 31:41.237
There you are.

31:42.372 --> 31:43.437
Sorry, I'm late.

31:52.613 --> 31:55.086
- <i> I won't lie to you.</i>

31:55.121 --> 31:57.154
I had every intention
of standing you up.

31:57.689 --> 31:59.684
And then, of course, the day
rolls around and I thought,

32:00.219 --> 32:02.027
sod it, I may as well get this
over and done with.

32:02.062 --> 32:03.259
So, you can imagine my surprise

32:03.294 --> 32:04.491
when you were the one
who stood me up.

32:05.956 --> 32:07.956
<i>I've not received any letters</i>
<i>from you in this past week,</i>

32:07.991 --> 32:09.628
<i>so I'm glad my messages</i>
<i>have got through.</i>

32:11.401 --> 32:13.269
<i>Time for you to start pestering</i>
<i>another victim, eh?</i>

32:13.838 --> 32:15.865
<i>Oh, and you can keep</i>
<i>the blurb for your book.</i>

32:16.670 --> 32:17.702
You earned that.

32:21.213 --> 32:23.180
Well, I guess this is
goodbye, Mr. DuKent.

32:25.316 --> 32:27.481
Goodbye.

33:04.553 --> 33:05.750
- Like I was
telling you, sir,

33:06.152 --> 33:07.851
we pick up and deliver same day.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.459
You need a package delivered
to San Diego by day's end...

33:11.494 --> 33:13.527
- Thank you, Corina.
Well, we can do that.

33:13.795 --> 33:15.067
So, you do pickup then?

33:15.102 --> 33:16.959
It's more convenient
for our customers that way.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.532
Because I need to know
where this envelope

33:18.567 --> 33:19.599
has been picked up from.

33:20.034 --> 33:22.437
Well, you have used us before.
How was the service?

33:22.472 --> 33:24.076
When you're done.
Relentless.

33:24.111 --> 33:26.606
Yeah? Well, what's
the return address?

33:26.641 --> 33:28.542
It's Aspen, Colorado.

33:28.844 --> 33:30.181
Aspen, Colorado?

33:30.216 --> 33:32.051
Well, we definitely
don't go out that far.

33:33.252 --> 33:34.845
Well, it's obviously being
picked up from somewhere.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.748
Yeah, that's usually
how it works, sir.

33:37.717 --> 33:39.619
There must be some address
that you can give to me.

33:41.491 --> 33:42.886
With all due respect, sir,

33:43.555 --> 33:46.362
we are very protective
of our clientele's privacy.

33:46.797 --> 33:48.925
Company policy.
I'm sure you can understand.

33:49.763 --> 33:50.894
No way, dude.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.272
Correct, but don't
forget about the invoice.

33:55.707 --> 33:57.032
Okay? Thank you.

33:58.640 --> 33:59.738
I understand.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.379
But I need that address.

34:26.239 --> 34:27.304
- I'm not finding anything.

34:28.406 --> 34:30.439
No pickups,
no deliveries, nothing.

34:30.474 --> 34:31.968
There must be
some kind of mistake.

34:33.741 --> 34:34.905
- Where did you
get this from again?

34:35.641 --> 34:38.414
From your driver.
I have 100 of these at my house.

34:39.648 --> 34:41.450
- One of our drivers
delivered this to you?

34:41.485 --> 34:43.485
Yes. He drives a red hatchback.

34:44.785 --> 34:46.015
Like I was telling you, sir,

34:47.821 --> 34:50.085
these are the only vehicles
our drivers use.

34:59.162 --> 35:02.064
Whole time? Fucking
asshole! Uninvited!

35:02.099 --> 35:03.769
Bloody car!

35:14.716 --> 35:15.979
Mr. Cogburn?

35:18.390 --> 35:19.455
Are you all right?

35:22.394 --> 35:23.954
And did you catch
the plates at all?

35:24.726 --> 35:25.791
No.

35:26.794 --> 35:29.597
You know, Colorado, Nevada,
Texas, they all look different.

35:29.632 --> 35:30.664
I didn't see them.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.965
And was he a big guy?
Skinny? Short? Tall?
I don't know.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.308
Oh, come on.
You gotta remember something.
Well, I fucking don't, okay?

35:37.343 --> 35:38.837
I didn't get a good
enough look at him, so...

35:40.643 --> 35:42.478
Okay, so I don't need
this shit today.

35:42.513 --> 35:43.908
This is actually my day off.

35:43.943 --> 35:45.382
So why don't you just
come by the station.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.186
I... I think
he had long hair. Like...

35:47.888 --> 35:49.815
a sort of mousy color, I think.

35:50.217 --> 35:52.015
What about these letters?
What do they say?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.654
- Nothing.
It's just a wannabe writer.

35:53.689 --> 35:57.119
Oh, okay. So, they're more
fan mail-ish than death threats?

35:57.154 --> 35:58.791
He's bloody well been
to my house.

35:59.193 --> 36:02.157
You know, how about
the guy who read your book?

36:02.626 --> 36:04.335
The shooter from Knoxville.
No, it's not him.

36:04.904 --> 36:06.194
Are you sure about that?

36:06.229 --> 36:08.537
He's rotting away
in... in a supermax prison

36:08.572 --> 36:10.704
somewhere in New Mexico
for a long time, it's not him.

36:10.972 --> 36:12.508
- Can we go home now?
- We can.

36:13.277 --> 36:15.874
I'm gonna stop by the station
and run this Colorado address.

36:15.909 --> 36:17.678
I'm also going to go by
some motor lodges

36:17.713 --> 36:20.384
and just see if anyone's
checked in with a red hatchback.

36:20.815 --> 36:21.847
Okay.

36:22.416 --> 36:23.585
Can I ask you a question?

36:24.489 --> 36:26.082
Is there anybody out there
who might have

36:26.117 --> 36:27.490
a score to settle with you?

36:30.759 --> 36:34.024
No.
Okay. All right.
Okay, let's do it.

36:36.534 --> 36:38.193
You call me if anything changes.

36:39.130 --> 36:40.833
Take it easy, Mr. Cogburn.

36:42.903 --> 36:44.199
- Are we still
getting ice cream?
- No.

36:44.234 --> 36:46.575
We're going to get
some fish, uncooked.

36:46.610 --> 36:47.807
Like, raw fish.

36:47.842 --> 36:49.710
- Ew. No. I want ice cream.

37:23.874 --> 37:24.943
<i>That's right, the fire marshal</i>

37:25.278 --> 37:27.913
<i>revealed there is evidence</i>
<i>that someone intentionally set</i>

37:27.948 --> 37:29.882
<i>this suburban Aspen home</i>
<i>on fire.</i>

37:29.917 --> 37:32.885
<i>Neighbors tell me the home</i>
<i>has been abandoned for decades,</i>

37:32.920 --> 37:35.690
<i>but the evil, as they call it,</i>
<i>that once lived here</i>

37:35.725 --> 37:37.054
<i>at 53 Highland Avenue</i>

37:37.089 --> 37:39.254
<i>was once the center</i>
<i>of a national tragedy.</i>

37:40.730 --> 37:43.797
<i>In June of 1981,</i>
<i>17-year-old Dwight Tufford</i>

37:43.832 --> 37:44.831
<i>left his Aspen home</i>

37:45.133 --> 37:47.603
<i>to drive 23 hours</i>
<i>to Knoxville, Tennessee.</i>

37:47.972 --> 37:50.166
<i>Once there,</i>
<i>he did the unthinkable,</i>

37:50.201 --> 37:53.906
<i>killing 13 people and injuring</i>
<i>nearly two dozen more</i>

37:53.941 --> 37:55.270
<i>in just a matter of minutes.</i>

37:55.805 --> 37:58.317
<i>From the top of the tower</i>
<i>in the middle of campus,</i>

37:58.752 --> 38:00.649
<i>Tufford took aim</i>
<i>at the crowd below</i>

38:00.684 --> 38:01.980
<i>with a high-powered rifle.</i>

38:02.582 --> 38:04.554
<i>During the trial,</i>
<i>Tufford told the judge</i>

38:04.589 --> 38:06.457
<i>he was innocent,</i>
<i>and testified</i>

38:06.492 --> 38:08.822
<i>he was brainwashed into</i>
<i>committing the killings</i>

38:08.857 --> 38:11.055
<i>after reading</i>
<i>the controversial novel,</i>

38:11.090 --> 38:12.287
<i>The Infernal Mach--</i>

39:10.413 --> 39:13.150
You're a fucking coward.
You hear me? A fucking coward.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.855
I know what
you look like, DuKent.

39:14.890 --> 39:16.593
And if I find you,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

39:16.861 --> 39:18.694
You understand?
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

39:22.865 --> 39:23.930
Fuck!

40:04.643 --> 40:06.445
Hey. Saul?

40:51.085 --> 40:52.117
What the fuck?

40:53.086 --> 40:55.087
<i>You have one new message.</i>

40:59.522 --> 41:02.666
- <i> To listen</i>
<i>to your messages, press one.</i>

41:07.574 --> 41:08.705
<i>You're a fucking coward.</i>

41:09.174 --> 41:10.333
<i>Hear me? A fucking coward.</i>

41:10.635 --> 41:12.005
<i>I know what</i>
<i>you look like, DuKent.</i>

41:12.040 --> 41:13.776
<i>And if I find you,</i>
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you.</i>

41:14.011 --> 41:15.976
<i>You understand?</i>
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>

41:23.084 --> 41:25.689
- <i> To save</i>
<i>this message, press one.</i>

41:43.808 --> 41:46.204
- <i> To save</i>
<i>this message, press one.</i>

41:56.689 --> 41:59.019
- <i> To save</i>
<i>this message, press one.</i>

42:13.563 --> 42:14.837
<i>Message saved.</i>

42:26.884 --> 42:28.752
This is the model
of the shooting.

42:29.612 --> 42:30.622
Knoxville.

42:30.890 --> 42:32.085
- Yeah.

42:32.554 --> 42:33.889
That's it.
So what will you do now?

42:35.092 --> 42:37.552
Well, nothing, really. I mean,
technically, we're trespassing.

42:38.121 --> 42:40.962
Trespassing? Fuck off.
- Relax, I'm on your side.

42:42.262 --> 42:43.459
What's on that tape?

42:45.496 --> 42:46.605
I don't know.

43:04.584 --> 43:05.987
- <i> We've got</i>
<i>a credit card receipt</i>

43:06.255 --> 43:08.088
<i>for a high-powered rifle</i>
<i>with your name on it.</i>

43:08.390 --> 43:10.321
<i>Dozens of witnesses</i>
<i>place you at the scene.</i>

43:11.995 --> 43:13.093
- <i> I didn't do it.</i>

43:14.327 --> 43:16.261
<i>Didn't do what, Mr. Tufford?</i>

43:18.595 --> 43:20.133
<i>I didn't do those things.</i>

43:21.268 --> 43:23.906
- <i> Dwight.</i>
<i>Can I call you Dwight?</i>

43:25.437 --> 43:27.602
<i>Listen. We can't help you</i>

43:28.104 --> 43:30.275
<i>unless you help us,</i>
<i>you understand?</i>

43:31.850 --> 43:36.182
<i>The rifle. The one that we found</i>
<i>in your car, is that yours?</i>

43:38.285 --> 43:39.284
- <i> Yes.</i>

43:40.153 --> 43:42.650
- <i> Did you</i>
<i>go up into the bell tower</i>

43:42.685 --> 43:43.728
<i>with that rifle?</i>

43:44.863 --> 43:45.862
- <i> Yes.</i>

43:46.631 --> 43:48.392
- <i> I know the next</i>
<i>part isn't going to be easy,</i>

43:48.427 --> 43:50.196
<i>but I need to hear you</i>
<i>say it, all right?</i>

43:51.804 --> 43:54.497
- <i> I...</i>

43:56.204 --> 43:58.776
<i>I, uh...</i>

44:03.442 --> 44:04.881
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

44:07.545 --> 44:08.951
<i>He had to be punished.</i>

44:10.054 --> 44:11.382
- <i> Who had</i>
<i>to be punished, Dwight?</i>

44:12.957 --> 44:13.989
<i>God.</i>

44:15.487 --> 44:19.060
<i>You see, we're just a row</i>
<i>of dominos to Him.</i>

44:20.296 --> 44:24.703
<i>And once you and I tip over,</i>
<i>we're no longer relevant.</i>

44:25.172 --> 44:27.200
<i>That's why he made us</i>
<i>mortal, you know?</i>

44:28.069 --> 44:30.874
<i>So we can fade to dust.</i>
<i>Disappear.</i>

44:32.075 --> 44:34.042
<i>But if we can find the dominos,</i>

44:34.077 --> 44:35.945
<i>the ones that haven't</i>
<i>tipped over yet...</i>

44:37.476 --> 44:39.542
<i>well maybe there's a chance</i>
<i>to stop this.</i>

44:41.513 --> 44:42.578
- <i> Stop what?</i>

44:43.350 --> 44:44.415
- <i> His plan.</i>

44:46.518 --> 44:48.023
<i>I didn't kill anyone</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

44:49.653 --> 44:51.895
<i>I just stole a few</i>
<i>of God's dominos.</i>

44:53.195 --> 44:54.524
<i>And maybe, if I'm lucky,</i>

44:55.226 --> 44:57.032
<i>maybe they haven't</i>
<i>tipped over just yet.</i>

44:58.233 --> 44:59.496
<i>You a religious man?</i>

45:00.065 --> 45:02.697
<i>A member of some sort of cult?</i>
<i>No.</i>

45:03.066 --> 45:04.204
- <i> Then where</i>
<i>the hell did an idea</i>

45:04.239 --> 45:05.271
<i>like this come from?</i>

45:06.604 --> 45:07.845
- The Infernal Machine.

45:08.771 --> 45:09.913
<i>You should read it.</i>

45:11.081 --> 45:12.377
<i>You should all read it.</i>

45:13.213 --> 45:15.512
<i>Then you'll understand</i>
<i>how insignificant</i>

45:15.747 --> 45:16.854
<i>we all are to Him.</i>

45:22.290 --> 45:23.927
<i>I'm not afraid of you anymore.</i>

45:25.095 --> 45:26.127
<i>You hear me?</i>

45:30.232 --> 45:31.770
<i>You hear me?</i>

45:32.139 --> 45:34.333
<i>You can't stop it now,</i>
<i>you sick fuck!</i>

45:34.368 --> 45:36.104
- <i> Sit down.</i>
<i>I know my purpose!</i>

45:36.439 --> 45:37.776
<i>Get back in the chair.</i>
<i>I know my purpose!</i>

45:38.405 --> 45:40.306
<i>I know my purpose!</i>

45:41.375 --> 45:42.737
I'm just going to have a smoke.

46:29.390 --> 46:31.093
- You mind telling me
what that book of yours

46:31.128 --> 46:32.127
is all about?

46:33.625 --> 46:35.427
Uh, it's about a priest
who finds God.

46:37.233 --> 46:38.397
Metaphorically, or?

46:38.971 --> 46:41.466
No, no. Uh, actually.

46:42.799 --> 46:43.941
- What do they talk about?

46:45.340 --> 46:47.912
Um... the...
the priest wants to know

46:47.947 --> 46:49.606
what his purpose is in life,
so God...

46:51.115 --> 46:53.280
tells him, explains to him,
that when he was 12,

46:53.315 --> 46:55.381
he... he got him
to walk across the road to...

46:58.386 --> 46:59.385
slow down a car.

47:01.686 --> 47:02.993
- So, who was in the car?

47:05.162 --> 47:06.854
It's not... it's not relevant
who was in the car.

47:06.889 --> 47:08.295
He just needed it
to be slowed down.

47:11.135 --> 47:12.101
- That's it?

47:17.108 --> 47:18.910
Yeah. That's it.

47:24.214 --> 47:26.082
And then, in the end,
the priest gets his revenge.

47:28.515 --> 47:29.745
What, on God?

47:32.552 --> 47:33.749
O... on everybody.

47:36.061 --> 47:37.060
I'm going to go home.

47:37.495 --> 47:39.590
There's just this one thing
I want you to see inside.

47:45.466 --> 47:47.136
- <i> Every time</i>
<i>I make one of these calls,</i>

47:47.171 --> 47:49.501
<i>I have to travel 14 miles</i>
<i>to the nearest phone booth.</i>

47:49.536 --> 47:51.635
I don't need to listen to these.
I know what I said.

47:51.670 --> 47:53.010
It's not yours
you need to listen to.

47:54.739 --> 47:57.113
- <i> This call</i>
<i>will be recorded and monitored.</i>

47:58.083 --> 47:59.709
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>

48:00.311 --> 48:01.986
<i>Dwight Tufford.</i>

48:02.021 --> 48:03.317
<i>..an inmate at</i>

48:03.352 --> 48:05.352
<i>the Federal Penitentiary</i>
<i>of New Mexico.</i>

48:05.921 --> 48:08.091
<i>To accept this call, press one.</i>

48:11.188 --> 48:14.097
<i>Message saved. Next message.</i>

48:14.499 --> 48:17.298
- <i> This call</i>
<i>will be recorded and monitored.</i>

48:17.833 --> 48:20.433
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>
- Elijah?

48:21.766 --> 48:22.897
Are you here?

48:24.967 --> 48:26.043
You all right?

48:45.289 --> 48:47.592
<i>Officer Higgins.</i>
- <i> It's Bruce.</i>

48:47.994 --> 48:49.165
<i>Uh... listen.</i>

48:49.734 --> 48:51.530
<i>You wouldn't know anyone</i>
<i>over at the supermax</i>

48:51.565 --> 48:53.103
<i>in New Mexico, would you?</i>

48:54.601 --> 48:57.107
- <i> I know</i>
<i>a few guards there. Why?</i>

48:57.709 --> 48:59.637
- <i> I think</i>
<i>I might need a favor.</i>

49:31.308 --> 49:32.670
<i>You've got ten minutes.</i>

49:48.325 --> 49:49.423
I don't smoke.

49:55.563 --> 49:56.595
Do I know you?

49:57.532 --> 49:58.564
- No.

50:00.799 --> 50:02.370
You don't look like a "Smith."

50:04.209 --> 50:05.802
I would have gone with an O'Hara

50:05.837 --> 50:07.672
or a Campbell, personally, but

50:08.411 --> 50:09.872
hey, it's a free country, right?

50:12.415 --> 50:13.513
You a writer?

50:14.582 --> 50:17.319
Why do you ask that?
Folks coming here are either

50:17.721 --> 50:20.058
A, writers, or B, shrinks.

50:21.622 --> 50:22.720
I'm neither.

50:24.691 --> 50:25.756
Good.

50:26.425 --> 50:27.857
Then we're off to a great start.

50:28.526 --> 50:31.168
So just who the fuck
are you then?

50:33.865 --> 50:34.996
Nobody important.

50:38.672 --> 50:40.078
I... I'm just here to talk.

50:41.741 --> 50:42.740
Okay.

50:45.712 --> 50:46.942
About William DuKent.

50:50.618 --> 50:52.189
You a cop?
No.

50:53.225 --> 50:55.082
Hey, fellas?
You know the rules.

50:55.117 --> 50:57.689
My lawyer has gotta be present
if this guy is a cop.

50:57.724 --> 50:58.756
I'm not a cop.

51:00.298 --> 51:04.399
But I know that you've spoken
with DuKent recently.

51:06.403 --> 51:07.996
You're not very good
at poker, are you?

51:09.208 --> 51:11.142
That question,
right out the gate.

51:12.640 --> 51:13.936
Way too specific.

51:14.741 --> 51:16.444
There's no gray area
to work with.

51:16.946 --> 51:19.414
Now, if you had replaced
the word "spoken"

51:19.449 --> 51:20.712
with "communicated,"...

51:22.045 --> 51:24.617
then I wouldn't have known
what you know, you know?

51:25.884 --> 51:27.785
But you said "spoken,"

51:27.820 --> 51:29.325
which tells me that...

51:30.427 --> 51:33.131
you don't know shit.

51:34.596 --> 51:37.630
Words, if you don't know
how to play them,

51:38.798 --> 51:40.270
they'll sure as hell play you.

51:41.669 --> 51:43.405
So, what do you want
with William DuKent?

51:44.738 --> 51:47.772
I'll answer that after you tell
me what he wanted from you.

51:48.441 --> 51:50.577
My opinion.
Your opinion about what?

51:51.778 --> 51:55.186
A book.<i> The Infernal Machine.</i>
You ever read it?

51:55.988 --> 51:59.916
No.
Good. Don't.
That book will fuck you up.

52:01.689 --> 52:04.228
The right combination of words
will make a man do...

52:06.430 --> 52:07.561
just about anything.

52:09.664 --> 52:10.828
<i>Five minutes.</i>

52:13.096 --> 52:14.799
You ever heard
of number stations before?

52:17.672 --> 52:19.639
During the Cold War,
there was these

52:20.008 --> 52:21.806
short-wave radio broadcasts

52:21.841 --> 52:24.875
that sent out these cryptic
messages across the airwaves.

52:25.812 --> 52:27.108
Usually, a woman's voice

52:27.143 --> 52:29.044
spouting out numbers
and shit in German.

52:30.883 --> 52:32.520
And to the general public,
it sounded like

52:32.555 --> 52:34.654
a bunch of nonsense,
when in actual fact,

52:34.689 --> 52:37.019
it was a complex cipher.

52:37.554 --> 52:40.990
The beauty of this was,
instead of marking X on a window

52:41.025 --> 52:43.729
or hiding microfilm
in a hollow tooth,

52:44.098 --> 52:46.193
these sons of bitches
had the audacity

52:46.228 --> 52:48.371
to send their top-secret
transmission

52:49.040 --> 52:52.309
right out into the open
for the whole world to hear.

52:52.544 --> 52:54.542
What, are you saying there's
a hidden message in that book?

52:54.977 --> 52:56.005
- Something like that.

52:58.581 --> 53:01.219
And what is it?
Well, you didn't read it,
now did you?

53:01.721 --> 53:03.287
So it would be like
trying to describe

53:03.322 --> 53:05.146
the color turquoise
to a blind man.

53:05.918 --> 53:07.082
So, I'm a blind man now?

53:07.854 --> 53:08.886
You all are.

53:10.923 --> 53:12.593
That's funny. I thought
we were all dominos.

53:16.335 --> 53:17.928
I'm done talking here.
Hold on.

53:18.430 --> 53:21.701
It's so easy to sit on
that side of the world

53:21.736 --> 53:23.197
and judge me, isn't it?

53:23.232 --> 53:24.836
Why did DuKent want
your opinion?

53:24.871 --> 53:25.870
Ask him yourself.

53:27.071 --> 53:28.070
Guard.

53:28.439 --> 53:29.907
Please, just tell me now.

53:30.877 --> 53:32.239
He wanted to know if I saw

53:32.274 --> 53:33.878
the same things in the book
as he did.

53:35.079 --> 53:37.684
But in the end,
he turned out to be

53:37.719 --> 53:39.620
just a fucking liar,
like everyone else.

53:39.655 --> 53:41.116
Why? What did he lie about?

53:42.152 --> 53:45.362
He told me
that if I was honest with him,

53:46.728 --> 53:49.267
then he'd show up.
That he would? DuKent?

53:49.602 --> 53:51.896
No. The motherfucker
that put me in here.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.096
Bruce Cogburn.

53:58.102 --> 54:00.740
<i>Sechs, zwei, neun.</i>

55:58.464 --> 56:00.387
<i>We're sorry.</i>

56:00.422 --> 56:02.224
<i>Your call cannot</i>
<i>be completed and dialed.</i>

56:02.492 --> 56:04.226
<i>Please, check the number</i>
<i>and dial again.</i>

56:04.595 --> 56:06.327
<i>We're sorry.</i>

56:06.562 --> 56:08.230
<i>Your call cannot</i>
<i>be completed and dialed.</i>

56:08.632 --> 56:10.441
<i>Please, check the number</i>
<i>and dial again.</i>

56:10.709 --> 56:12.542
<i>We're sorry.</i>

56:12.577 --> 56:14.577
<i>Your call cannot be</i>
<i>completed and dialed.</i>

56:14.612 --> 56:16.678
<i>Please, check the number</i>
<i>and dial again.</i>

56:16.713 --> 56:18.449
<i>We're sorry.</i>

56:18.484 --> 56:20.275
<i>Your call cannot</i>
<i>be completed and dialed...</i>

57:04.620 --> 57:05.661
- <i> Bruce.</i>
Jerry.

57:06.030 --> 57:07.355
I'm not sure what
you've been told,

57:07.657 --> 57:08.928
or who you've been
talking to...

57:08.963 --> 57:11.601
- <i> We got the manuscript.</i>
<i>It's brilliant.</i>

57:11.936 --> 57:14.571
What?
- <i> Anonymous? Oh, come on.</i>

57:14.606 --> 57:16.364
<i>There's nobody</i>
<i>that writes like you.</i>

57:17.133 --> 57:18.333
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>how we're going to spin</i>

57:18.368 --> 57:20.511
<i>this whole subject matter</i>
<i>and all.</i>

57:20.813 --> 57:22.139
<i>Makes perfect sense</i>
<i>why you're going</i>

57:22.174 --> 57:23.646
<i>with the whole</i>
<i>"anonymous" angle.</i>

57:23.681 --> 57:24.779
What are you talking about?

57:25.181 --> 57:26.473
- <i> It's just,</i>
<i>your protagonist</i>

57:26.508 --> 57:27.551
<i>sounds a lot like you.</i>

57:27.920 --> 57:30.246
<i>But I gotta tell ya,</i>
<i>this William DuKent,</i>

57:30.281 --> 57:31.588
<i>he is something else.</i>

57:32.151 --> 57:33.282
What did you say?

57:33.317 --> 57:35.317
<i>William DuKent.</i>
<i>Am I saying it right?</i>

57:36.386 --> 57:37.561
<i>When can we get the rest</i>
<i>of the manuscript?</i>

57:37.596 --> 57:39.387
Send it! Send it to me!
- <i> What?</i>

57:39.422 --> 57:40.564
<i>Bruce, what the hell</i>
<i>are you talking about?</i>

57:40.599 --> 57:42.093
Send me the fucking
manuscript, Jerry!

58:24.335 --> 58:25.840
- <i> I'm calling</i>
<i>in response to the letters</i>

58:25.875 --> 58:26.874
<i>I've received from you.</i>

58:27.276 --> 58:29.239
<i>I'm not sure how you found me.</i>

58:29.541 --> 58:32.550
<i>Maybe you got my PO box</i>
<i>from an old agent or summit.</i>

58:33.883 --> 58:36.510
<i>Saul. According</i>
<i>to the Hebrew Bible,</i>

58:36.545 --> 58:38.248
<i>Saul was the first</i>
<i>king of Israel.</i>

58:39.581 --> 58:40.756
<i>I bet you didn't know that.</i>

58:43.585 --> 58:45.156
- <i> Your letters</i>
<i>are unsolicited</i>

58:45.191 --> 58:46.454
and constitute harassment,

58:46.489 --> 58:48.962
<i>so please, stop sending them.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>

58:48.997 --> 58:51.833
<i>'Cause I'm not here to be</i>
<i>someone's fucking inspiration.</i>

58:51.868 --> 58:53.098
<i>Someone's fucking muse.</i>

58:53.366 --> 58:55.496
- <i> I 've heard your name</i>
<i>somewhere. Are you famous?</i>

58:55.531 --> 58:57.036
- <i> Who the fuck are you?</i>
- <i> Nobody important.</i>

58:57.071 --> 58:59.742
- <i> You're that writer.</i>
- <i> 21st June. 1981.</i>

58:59.777 --> 59:01.502
<i>Knoxville.</i>
<i>That book will fuck you up.</i>

59:01.537 --> 59:03.339
- <i> Crazy's always looking</i>
<i>for an excuse to be crazy,</i>

59:03.374 --> 59:05.044
<i>I guess, you know?</i>
- <i> He had to be punished.</i>

59:05.079 --> 59:06.782
<i>Who had to be punished?</i>
- <i> God.</i>

59:06.817 --> 59:08.212
- <i> It's about a priest</i>
<i>who finds God.</i>

59:08.247 --> 59:10.214
- <i> Metaphorically?</i>
- <i> No, actually.</i>

59:10.249 --> 59:12.381
<i>The right combination</i>
<i>of words will make a man do...</i>

59:12.416 --> 59:14.988
- <i> We're just</i>
<i>a row of dominoes to him.</i>
- <i> ...just about anything.</i>

59:15.023 --> 59:17.551
- <i> You saying there's a</i>
<i>hidden message in that book?</i>

59:18.053 --> 59:19.861
- <i> Fucking nutjob.</i>
<i>That guy's a fucking...</i>

59:19.896 --> 59:21.588
- <i> I don't need to listen</i>
<i>to these. I know what I said.</i>

59:21.623 --> 59:22.963
- <i> Fade to dust. Disappear.</i>

59:22.998 --> 59:24.360
- <i> You gotta remember...</i>

59:24.395 --> 59:25.933
- <i> You don't know shit.</i>

59:25.968 --> 59:27.363
- <i> Stop writing to me, okay?</i>

59:27.398 --> 59:28.738
- <i> What do they say?</i>
- <i> Nothing.</i>

59:29.334 --> 59:30.740
- <i> Words...</i>

59:30.975 --> 59:32.104
<i>if you don't</i>
<i>know how to play them...</i>

59:33.470 --> 59:35.371
- <i> If I find you...</i>
- <i> ...they'll sure as hell</i>

59:35.406 --> 59:37.538
<i>play you.</i>
- <i> You understand?</i>

59:37.573 --> 59:39.078
<i>I'm gonna fucking kill you!</i>
- Mr. Cogburn?

59:43.018 --> 59:44.116
These just came in for you.

1:00:07.339 --> 1:00:08.910
- <i> We got the manuscript.</i>

1:00:08.945 --> 1:00:10.439
- <i> It's brilliant.</i>

1:00:11.277 --> 1:00:12.848
- <i> Anonymous? Oh, come on.</i>

1:00:13.584 --> 1:00:15.312
<i>There's nobody</i>
<i>that writes like you.</i>

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:16.598
I know where we are, Mr. DuKent.
I know exactly where we are.

1:02:16.633 --> 1:02:18.270
We're at the end
of act two, aren't we?

1:02:19.570 --> 1:02:21.779
That's where the protagonist
reaches their limits.

1:02:22.804 --> 1:02:23.979
Questions their worth.

1:02:24.448 --> 1:02:25.981
Their sanity. Everything.

1:02:26.683 --> 1:02:29.017
Because they know
the path traveled

1:02:29.052 --> 1:02:30.920
pales in comparison
to what lies ahead.

1:02:31.656 --> 1:02:33.791
And it's in this moment,
Mr. DuKent,

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:36.255
that a decision must be made.

1:02:37.654 --> 1:02:38.796
<i>Do they carry on,</i>

1:02:39.623 --> 1:02:41.689
<i>or do they stop and go back?</i>

1:02:42.967 --> 1:02:45.396
But only they
can make that choice.

1:02:45.431 --> 1:02:48.432
And that, Mr. DuKent,
is where you fucked up.

1:02:49.468 --> 1:02:51.237
Because your protagonist

1:02:51.272 --> 1:02:53.503
is too aware
of your narrative now,

1:02:53.872 --> 1:02:56.473
and to make matters worse,
he's also a writer.

1:02:56.508 --> 1:02:58.640
So he knows exactly
what a good story needs,

1:02:58.675 --> 1:03:00.378
and also how to sabotage one.

1:03:02.316 --> 1:03:05.449
What's the greatest sin
a writer can commit?

1:03:10.027 --> 1:03:11.191
<i>Do you know?</i>

1:03:12.821 --> 1:03:13.963
<i>Being dull.</i>

1:03:15.296 --> 1:03:16.790
And that's exactly
what I'm going to give you,

1:03:16.825 --> 1:03:18.198
you stupid fucking cunt.

1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:22.466
A long, drawn-out,
uneventful, boring ending.

1:03:23.942 --> 1:03:27.108
Because nobody gives a damn
about an inspired second act

1:03:27.143 --> 1:03:29.143
if your finale
is a big pile of shit.

1:03:32.478 --> 1:03:33.642
Wouldn't you agree?

1:03:35.853 --> 1:03:40.517
<i>Zwei, sechs, sechs, zwei.</i>

1:03:49.627 --> 1:03:51.330
- <i> Without a doubt.</i>

1:04:29.975 --> 1:04:31.007
Who is it?

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:33.306
- <i> United States federal</i>
<i>marshals, Mr. Cogburn.</i>

1:04:34.210 --> 1:04:35.803
Ah, we've gone
federal now, have we?

1:04:36.872 --> 1:04:37.915
- <i> Can you step</i>
<i>outside, please?</i>

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:42.810
I suppose you've got
some convincing ID printed up?

1:04:50.853 --> 1:04:52.424
Everything all right there,
Mr. Cogburn?

1:04:53.130 --> 1:04:54.228
Everything all right with you?

1:04:55.561 --> 1:04:57.099
Were you in New Mexico
a few days back?

1:04:57.794 --> 1:04:58.936
I don't know, you tell me.

1:05:00.137 --> 1:05:01.664
Mind telling us
the reason for the trip?

1:05:02.033 --> 1:05:03.270
- I was visiting someone.

1:05:03.939 --> 1:05:05.272
- Was that someone
Dwight Tufford?

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:07.571
Well, that's not
a crime, is it?

1:05:08.173 --> 1:05:11.047
That's not a crime, sir,
but signing in as Richard Smith

1:05:11.082 --> 1:05:12.279
at the front desk,
that's a crime.

1:05:12.314 --> 1:05:13.445
Where'd you get this from?

1:05:16.648 --> 1:05:18.483
We're aware of the history
between you two, all right?

1:05:18.751 --> 1:05:19.847
We're just trying to figure out

1:05:19.882 --> 1:05:20.991
why you would want to go
and see him now.

1:05:21.950 --> 1:05:22.993
Closure, I guess.

1:05:24.425 --> 1:05:26.997
Has Dwight Tufford contacted
you in the last 24 hours?

1:05:27.499 --> 1:05:28.889
No. Why would he do that?

1:05:29.758 --> 1:05:31.199
- You been
watching TV this morning?

1:05:31.634 --> 1:05:33.828
I don't have a television.
I'm not that kind of person.

1:05:36.074 --> 1:05:37.106
Why?

1:05:38.309 --> 1:05:39.735
<i>The FBI's manhunt is focusing</i>

1:05:39.770 --> 1:05:42.342
<i>its search on Dwight Tufford</i>
<i>in the Los Alamos area</i>

1:05:42.377 --> 1:05:43.607
<i>of New Mexico.</i>

1:05:44.109 --> 1:05:46.676
<i>Despite being held</i>
<i>in a maximum-security prison,</i>

1:05:46.711 --> 1:05:48.909
<i>Tufford somehow slipped</i>
<i>past the guards last night,</i>

1:05:49.278 --> 1:05:50.779
<i>sparking a nationwide panic.</i>

1:05:58.624 --> 1:06:00.195
<i>In 1981, Tufford arrived</i>

1:06:00.230 --> 1:06:03.033
<i>at the Knoxville Baptist</i>
<i>University campus with a rifle.</i>

1:06:03.668 --> 1:06:05.794
<i>Taking aim, he pointed his gun</i>
<i>at the crowd below</i>

1:06:05.829 --> 1:06:06.927
<i>and he shot dozens.</i>

1:06:08.337 --> 1:06:10.304
<i>Thirteen students</i>
<i>and faculty members died.</i>

1:06:11.373 --> 1:06:13.472
<i>He is responsible for</i>
<i>the deadliest shooting</i>

1:06:13.507 --> 1:06:14.539
<i>in Tennessee history.</i>

1:06:15.707 --> 1:06:18.312
<i>One witness described it</i>
<i>as mass chaos.</i>

1:06:19.281 --> 1:06:21.051
<i>No one knew where the bullets</i>
<i>were coming from,</i>

1:06:21.420 --> 1:06:22.481
<i>or where to run.</i>

1:07:12.465 --> 1:07:15.105
<i>But so was Orwell's</i> 1984

1:07:15.140 --> 1:07:17.866
<i>or Joyce's</i> Ulysses
<i>when first published.</i>

1:07:18.802 --> 1:07:21.441
<i>The only crime</i>
<i>Mr. Cogburn ever committed</i>

1:07:21.743 --> 1:07:23.476
<i>was writing one book.</i>

1:07:23.945 --> 1:07:25.676
- <i> So it begins</i>
<i>with the author's intent?</i>

1:07:26.045 --> 1:07:28.415
- <i> That's fair to say.</i>
<i>So, what is the intent</i>

1:07:28.450 --> 1:07:29.515
<i>of</i> The Infernal machine?

1:07:29.917 --> 1:07:31.484
- <i> I believe</i>
<i>only Mr. Cogburn</i>

1:07:31.519 --> 1:07:32.551
can answer that question.

1:07:39.395 --> 1:07:42.396
INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1:07:55.609 --> 1:07:56.971
- <i> Take it easy,</i>
<i>Mr. Cogburn.</i>

1:07:57.840 --> 1:07:58.841
- <i> Are we still</i>
<i>getting ice cream?</i>

1:07:59.276 --> 1:08:01.382
- <i> No. We're going</i>
<i>to get some fish, uncooked.</i>

1:08:01.684 --> 1:08:02.878
<i>Like, raw fish.</i>

1:08:02.913 --> 1:08:04.913
- <i> Ew. No. I want ice cream.</i>

Show's not till 7 tomorrow,

1:08:49.399 --> 1:08:50.860
so I assume you should have
plenty of time to set up?

Okay, sure.

She's your daughter?

1:09:04.348 --> 1:09:05.380
Yeah.

1:09:06.647 --> 1:09:08.713
She booked her first
TV job last week.

1:09:09.048 --> 1:09:10.187
I mean, nothing much.

1:09:11.190 --> 1:09:13.850
A walk-on on one of those hidden
camera shows? But she loved it.

1:09:13.885 --> 1:09:14.917
What was the show?

1:09:15.286 --> 1:09:16.424
They never tell you that.

1:09:17.360 --> 1:09:19.196
They had her playing
in the park or something?

1:09:19.598 --> 1:09:21.231
The casting director,
she was lovely.

1:09:22.058 --> 1:09:24.058
She was great, great with kids.

1:09:24.860 --> 1:09:26.236
Do you have kids?
Should take them there.

1:09:27.899 --> 1:09:30.064
Bishop and Rook.
I mean, amazing.

1:09:30.366 --> 1:09:31.835
It's so good.
Bishop and Rook?

1:09:31.870 --> 1:09:34.167
- Yeah, she's great

1:09:35.236 --> 1:09:37.005

You forgot something.

1:12:44.766 --> 1:12:45.765
Oh!

1:12:46.100 --> 1:12:48.867
Oh!

1:12:57.581 --> 1:12:58.745
Don't fucking move.

1:13:00.276 --> 1:13:02.408
Umm... I'll have another
vodka tonic, actually.

1:13:02.443 --> 1:13:05.620
And my associate here,
a whiskey, I believe?

1:13:09.417 --> 1:13:11.087
Stand up. We're not
doing this here.

1:13:11.122 --> 1:13:12.726
Well, I believe we are.
What, you think

1:13:12.761 --> 1:13:14.530
that revolver is going
to convince me otherwise?

1:13:15.258 --> 1:13:16.257
Why don't you give it a go?

1:13:16.959 --> 1:13:18.831
I'm not sure you'll have
much luck, though,

1:13:18.866 --> 1:13:20.569
considering we took all
the bullets out of the gun.

1:13:24.575 --> 1:13:25.706
Bullshit.

1:13:25.741 --> 1:13:27.301
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

1:13:30.911 --> 1:13:33.978
Right. So, I think
we are going to do this,

1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:35.309
so why don't you take a seat?

1:13:45.024 --> 1:13:47.992
What do you want?
From you? Nothing.

1:13:48.797 --> 1:13:49.895
Then who are you?

1:13:50.330 --> 1:13:51.897
Say a young couple
wants to get married.

1:13:51.932 --> 1:13:53.327
They find themselves
a wedding planner.

1:13:53.629 --> 1:13:55.505
Or if you want to host
a fancy dinner party,

1:13:55.874 --> 1:13:57.298
you hire a chef.

1:13:57.566 --> 1:13:59.806
But if you need to turn
someone's world upside down,

1:14:00.275 --> 1:14:01.335
then you hire me.

1:14:02.171 --> 1:14:03.436
And that's what
you think you're doing?

1:14:03.471 --> 1:14:05.944
No, it's what I've done.
The proof of that is you

1:14:06.646 --> 1:14:08.078
sitting right opposite me.
Thank you.

1:14:09.345 --> 1:14:10.751
The reason I'm sitting
opposite you is

1:14:10.786 --> 1:14:12.181
because I found
your fake daughter.

1:14:13.349 --> 1:14:15.316
You're a sicko,
endangering a kid like that.

1:14:15.351 --> 1:14:17.956
Endangered?
That's a bit dramatic, isn't it?

1:14:18.525 --> 1:14:20.761
That little angel went home
with 300 dollars in her pocket.

1:14:21.029 --> 1:14:22.125
All she had to do was
pretend to be

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:23.324
someone else for a few hours.

1:14:24.293 --> 1:14:27.097
Isn't that what you've been
doing the last 25 years?

1:14:28.804 --> 1:14:31.464
Do you know, the difference
between you and I

1:14:32.368 --> 1:14:33.543
is that I know what I am.

1:14:34.777 --> 1:14:37.371
I'm a liar.
And I'm fucking good at it.

1:14:38.473 --> 1:14:39.780
I can be anything
you want me to be.

1:14:39.815 --> 1:14:41.980
Could be a person,
a company, a scenario.

1:14:42.215 --> 1:14:44.510
Usually, the marks are
sort of politicians and CEOs.

1:14:44.545 --> 1:14:46.655
They're always boring.
They're always forgettable.

1:14:46.957 --> 1:14:48.382
And that's what separates
you from them.

1:14:48.417 --> 1:14:50.890
What, because I'm not boring?
Oh no, you're very boring.

1:14:51.292 --> 1:14:52.452
But you're not forgettable.

1:14:52.854 --> 1:14:54.322
And that's why
I took this assignment.

1:14:54.724 --> 1:14:57.930
Because history is going
to remember you, Bruce.

1:14:58.669 --> 1:15:00.031
And that really bothers me.

1:15:01.672 --> 1:15:04.673
Because you dress in your
sort of Sam Shepard clothes,

1:15:04.908 --> 1:15:07.005
and you drink like Capote
and live like Thompson,

1:15:07.474 --> 1:15:09.810
all so the world will know
there's artistic genius,

1:15:09.845 --> 1:15:11.647
but you and I know
there's no artistic genius.

1:15:11.682 --> 1:15:12.846
There's no mystique.
Shut it.

1:15:12.881 --> 1:15:13.880
You got lucky.

1:15:14.215 --> 1:15:16.212
You built your ivory tower
brick by brick with lies.

1:15:16.247 --> 1:15:17.719
Shut your fucking mouth.
And I'm here

1:15:18.121 --> 1:15:19.721
to make sure you burn in it.

1:15:21.692 --> 1:15:24.055
'Cause you see, it's pride
that's the Achilles' heel

1:15:24.323 --> 1:15:25.694
of mediocre men.

1:15:25.729 --> 1:15:27.058
Shut it with
your fucking pride talk.

1:15:27.093 --> 1:15:28.323
That's not the reason
why I'm here.

1:15:28.358 --> 1:15:30.490
Right. Sorry. Yes, of course.
My bad. So...

1:15:31.933 --> 1:15:34.032
that little girl,
I so carelessly endangered.

1:15:34.901 --> 1:15:37.233
Okay, total hypothetical here,
what if, just what if,

1:15:37.268 --> 1:15:40.203
I wanted you to find the girl,
her mother, my office,

1:15:40.438 --> 1:15:41.611
the stack of receipts,
all of it?
Right.

1:15:41.879 --> 1:15:43.877
Right, well, that would make
you a fucking genius,

1:15:43.912 --> 1:15:45.945
and I don't think you are.
No.

1:15:48.444 --> 1:15:49.509
Probably not.

1:16:07.672 --> 1:16:09.298
- Mister? Mister?

1:16:10.466 --> 1:16:11.465
You forgot something.

1:16:12.633 --> 1:16:16.140
- Mister? Mister?
You forgot something.

1:16:16.978 --> 1:16:18.208
Wait...

1:16:18.243 --> 1:16:19.539
Oh!

1:16:20.377 --> 1:16:21.409
Wait.

1:16:22.078 --> 1:16:23.917
- <i> I'm not sure</i>
<i>you'll have much luck, though,</i>

1:16:23.952 --> 1:16:25.622
<i>considering we took</i>
<i>all the bullets out of the gun.</i>

1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:29.186
- <i> Bullshit.</i>
- <i> There's only</i>
<i>one way to find out.</i>

1:16:29.221 --> 1:16:30.319
<i>There's only</i>
<i>one way to find out.</i>

1:16:33.588 --> 1:16:36.094
Wait. Hold on.

1:16:37.295 --> 1:16:38.558
Listen, I don't know...

1:16:50.143 --> 1:16:52.143
Who are you?
Oh, nobody important.

1:16:52.915 --> 1:16:54.046
I'm just the messenger.

1:16:56.413 --> 1:16:58.347
Then who's sending
the fucking messages?

1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:02.285
Don't worry, Bruce.
You'll see him soon enough.

1:17:21.911 --> 1:17:22.976
You all right?

1:17:24.705 --> 1:17:26.144
I've got a steak
in the fridge if you like.

1:17:27.213 --> 1:17:28.212
Come on.

1:17:36.156 --> 1:17:38.519
- Saul?

1:17:38.988 --> 1:17:40.290
Saul?

1:17:40.725 --> 1:17:42.655
Saul! Hey! Hey!

1:17:43.097 --> 1:17:44.162
Saul!

1:17:47.365 --> 1:17:48.628
Saul!

1:18:03.854 --> 1:18:04.853
Fuck.

1:18:07.891 --> 1:18:08.923
Saul!

1:18:54.564 --> 1:18:55.761
Hello?

1:18:57.402 --> 1:18:58.434
- Bruce?

1:19:05.410 --> 1:19:08.708
That dog of yours
has got a lot of spirit.

1:19:11.955 --> 1:19:13.482
Do you want to come out
and talk about it?

1:19:16.322 --> 1:19:17.453
No?

1:19:21.591 --> 1:19:22.623
Okay.

1:19:25.496 --> 1:19:27.628
Hell of a gun
you got yourself here, Bruce.

1:19:29.170 --> 1:19:31.170
If I would have had
one of these on the day,

1:19:33.273 --> 1:19:35.735
I would have gotten a lot more
than 13, I'll tell you that.

1:19:37.343 --> 1:19:38.947
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

1:19:41.248 --> 1:19:42.610
The first eight I killed,

1:19:43.349 --> 1:19:44.447
they were easy.

1:19:44.982 --> 1:19:46.086
They just stood there.

1:19:47.023 --> 1:19:48.022
Emotionless.

1:19:49.025 --> 1:19:50.123
Confused.

1:19:51.390 --> 1:19:53.093
Like they couldn't make sense
of any of it.

1:20:01.796 --> 1:20:03.796
'Cause you can't make sense
out of madness now...

1:20:05.701 --> 1:20:06.700
can you, Bruce?

1:20:09.111 --> 1:20:10.473
No. You can't.

1:20:11.806 --> 1:20:13.377
But you killed 13, not eight.

1:20:14.809 --> 1:20:16.182
What were the other five
guilty of?

1:20:21.288 --> 1:20:22.683
Running in straight lines,
I guess.

1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:26.159
Ah.

1:20:26.427 --> 1:20:28.128
I really wish
that you and I had met

1:20:28.163 --> 1:20:29.690
under different circumstances.

1:20:30.693 --> 1:20:31.857
Because I've got
a lot of questions

1:20:31.892 --> 1:20:33.100
about that book of yours.

1:20:45.172 --> 1:20:47.840
Shh! Shh!

1:20:49.415 --> 1:20:50.579
Don't worry, Bruce.

1:20:52.418 --> 1:20:55.287
I ain't letting you die,
I'll make sure of that.

1:20:56.125 --> 1:20:57.223
You see,

1:20:57.925 --> 1:21:02.426
I gave 20 years of my fucking
life for that book of yours.

1:21:04.265 --> 1:21:06.100
And now I'm going
to need some answers.

1:21:07.730 --> 1:21:09.268
Eight hundred pages' worth.

1:21:09.570 --> 1:21:13.008
And there is nothing,
and I mean nothing,

1:21:13.043 --> 1:21:15.010
that I'm not willing to do.

1:21:16.112 --> 1:21:18.112
"There they go.

1:21:18.614 --> 1:21:20.917
One by one, two by two,

1:21:22.316 --> 1:21:23.381
that long line

1:21:23.783 --> 1:21:25.779
crawling its way
up the sidewalk.

1:21:26.551 --> 1:21:27.583
Builders.

1:21:28.388 --> 1:21:29.453
Doctors.

1:21:29.988 --> 1:21:32.027
Farmers. Plumbers. Thieves.

1:21:32.462 --> 1:21:35.063
All entering God's house
like ants

1:21:35.432 --> 1:21:37.725
walking across
a picnic blanket."

1:21:40.796 --> 1:21:42.697
God, you've got a way
with words, Bruce.

1:21:43.832 --> 1:21:45.139
"Then the priest thought..."

1:21:47.577 --> 1:21:49.946
"...why don't they join me
out here on the grass?

1:21:50.648 --> 1:21:53.477
That way, the ones
who want sun, get it,

1:21:53.745 --> 1:21:56.150
and the ones that don't, don't.

1:21:56.652 --> 1:21:58.988
This way,
I can tell them the truth.

1:21:59.584 --> 1:22:01.419
That it's 95 degrees.

1:22:02.422 --> 1:22:03.784
That's all I know for certain.

1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:10.362
The rest is up
for interpretation."

1:22:30.153 --> 1:22:31.185
The book...

1:22:33.288 --> 1:22:34.419
What does it all mean?

1:22:38.920 --> 1:22:40.293
Pl... Please...

1:22:44.926 --> 1:22:46.035
Well, I would
like to tell you...

1:22:50.173 --> 1:22:51.370
but the truth is...

1:22:55.035 --> 1:22:56.144
I didn't write it.

1:24:14.158 --> 1:24:15.289
- <i> Professor.</i>

1:24:16.292 --> 1:24:20.921
<i>Elijah's been on life support</i>
<i>for the past two weeks.</i>

1:24:23.024 --> 1:24:26.135
<i>Even if he woke up,</i>
<i>he'd never be the same.</i>

1:24:27.369 --> 1:24:29.600
<i>My wife and I agree that...</i>

1:24:31.439 --> 1:24:33.868
<i>we need to end his suffering.</i>

1:25:23.623 --> 1:25:24.820
<i>What would I write about?</i>

1:25:26.659 --> 1:25:29.198
- <i> Anything.</i>
<i>Anything you want.</i>

1:25:29.794 --> 1:25:30.991
It's about a priest.

1:25:32.830 --> 1:25:33.961
- <i> Does it have a title?</i>

1:25:34.496 --> 1:25:36.029
- <i> No, not yet.</i>

1:27:27.384 --> 1:27:32.387
<i>Zwei, sechs, sechs, zwei.</i>

1:27:36.285 --> 1:27:38.822
<i>Zwei, zwei, sechs,</i>

1:27:39.224 --> 1:27:41.627
<i>sechs, zwei, neun.</i>

1:27:42.795 --> 1:27:47.996
<i>Eins, eins, funf,</i>
<i>eins, vier, neun.</i>

1:27:49.098 --> 1:27:54.409
<i>Zwei, zwei, sechs,</i>
<i>sechs, zwei, neun.</i>

1:28:42.052 --> 1:28:44.690
<i>Zwei, zwei, sechs,</i>

1:28:45.159 --> 1:28:47.627
<i>sechs, zwei, neun.</i>

1:28:52.227 --> 1:28:56.636
<i>Eins, eins, funf, eins, zehn.</i>

1:29:13.314 --> 1:29:15.523
<i>Zwei, zwei,</i>

1:29:16.058 --> 1:29:21.023
<i>sechs, sechs, zwei, neun.</i>

1:29:41.584 --> 1:29:42.748
- <i> Eins.</i>

1:29:44.279 --> 1:29:45.454
<i>Eins.</i>

1:29:47.524 --> 1:29:48.721
<i>Sechs.</i>

1:29:50.219 --> 1:29:51.251
<i>Eins.</i>

1:29:53.024 --> 1:29:53.990
<i>Sieben.</i>

1:29:55.763 --> 1:29:56.795
<i>Zwei.</i>

1:29:58.634 --> 1:29:59.732
<i>Neun.</i>

1:30:16.982 --> 1:30:21.380
- <i> "There they go.</i>
<i>One by one, two by two,</i>

1:30:21.415 --> 1:30:23.954
that long line crawling
its way up the sidewalk.

1:30:24.957 --> 1:30:29.322
<i>Builders, doctors, teachers,</i>
<i>farmers, plumbers, thieves.</i>

1:30:30.127 --> 1:30:32.600
All entering God's house
like ants

1:30:33.603 --> 1:30:35.471
<i>marching across</i>
<i>a picnic blanket.</i>

1:30:46.209 --> 1:30:47.274
Elijah?

1:30:57.022 --> 1:30:58.120
How did you find me?

1:31:02.390 --> 1:31:07.195
W... with lots and lots...

1:31:08.803 --> 1:31:12.035
of patience.

1:31:28.284 --> 1:31:29.415
How long have you been here?

1:31:30.484 --> 1:31:33.892
Almost five years, Professor.

1:31:35.225 --> 1:31:36.389
Oh, God.

1:31:52.275 --> 1:31:54.583
Cause and effect.

1:31:55.685 --> 1:31:57.751
Action and reaction.

1:31:58.019 --> 1:32:01.590
If you know the physical
properties of something,

1:32:02.359 --> 1:32:05.726
you can make it do
almost anything you...

1:32:06.861 --> 1:32:07.893
want.

1:32:09.358 --> 1:32:11.732
Human beings are no different.

1:32:20.006 --> 1:32:21.137
So, you knew I was coming?

1:32:21.439 --> 1:32:23.612
I was hoping for that

1:32:24.505 --> 1:32:25.944
conclusion, yes.

1:32:27.376 --> 1:32:29.915
I'm not a fortune teller,
I'm just a...

1:32:31.347 --> 1:32:32.687
just a writer.

1:32:34.581 --> 1:32:37.219
You see, all I did was

1:32:37.254 --> 1:32:42.059
place a few obstacles
in your path, and then I...

1:32:43.425 --> 1:32:46.261
waited to see
what you would do.

1:32:47.737 --> 1:32:51.530
And I must confess
that the dog...

1:32:55.943 --> 1:32:57.536
was a nice touch.

1:32:59.408 --> 1:33:04.543
How is Saul doing
by the way, hm?

1:33:05.953 --> 1:33:07.150
He'll live.

1:33:09.088 --> 1:33:11.759
Will Mr. Tufford
be joining us today?

1:33:14.489 --> 1:33:16.764
- I see.

1:33:17.333 --> 1:33:20.526
That's good.
I never was very...

1:33:20.928 --> 1:33:23.639
very fond
of that ending anyway.

1:33:24.108 --> 1:33:25.168
What ending is that?

1:33:27.337 --> 1:33:29.139
- Every story

1:33:29.608 --> 1:33:32.175
ends in one of two ways.

1:33:33.409 --> 1:33:37.686
Either the hero faces
his fears and is reborn,

1:33:39.151 --> 1:33:40.854
or he is punished

1:33:41.857 --> 1:33:44.154
for failing to change.

1:33:44.789 --> 1:33:48.895
And I'm really
curious, Professor.

1:33:50.866 --> 1:33:52.327
Which one are you?

1:33:54.936 --> 1:33:56.034
Don't you lecture me.

1:33:57.807 --> 1:33:58.872
What was I supposed to do?

1:34:00.172 --> 1:34:02.337
Your father told me,
he was gonna

1:34:02.372 --> 1:34:03.844
turn your fucking machine off.

1:34:04.546 --> 1:34:07.144
And that book was too important

1:34:07.179 --> 1:34:08.816
to just sit
on the fucking shelf!

1:34:09.351 --> 1:34:10.444
What do you want from me?

1:34:10.679 --> 1:34:11.984
What do you want from me?

1:34:12.019 --> 1:34:15.218
I only wish to take

1:34:16.023 --> 1:34:17.726
what you're willing to give me.

1:34:29.168 --> 1:34:30.266
All right.

1:34:34.074 --> 1:34:37.746
Right.

1:34:38.515 --> 1:34:40.012
And the point
to all of this is...

1:34:42.313 --> 1:34:43.411
...is punishment?

1:34:44.645 --> 1:34:47.250
Justice? Retribution?
Atonement?

1:34:47.923 --> 1:34:50.220
That's the point, is it?

1:34:50.255 --> 1:34:52.354
Writer's block.

1:34:58.395 --> 1:35:00.461
Since you stole...

1:35:02.168 --> 1:35:04.267
my first book, Bruce, I...

1:35:05.171 --> 1:35:06.170
I thought you...

1:35:06.605 --> 1:35:10.878
you wouldn't mind helping me...

1:35:12.948 --> 1:35:14.882
write my second book.

1:35:19.515 --> 1:35:20.580
But then...

1:35:21.649 --> 1:35:23.187
the more I wrote,

1:35:24.828 --> 1:35:26.894
the more I realized,

1:35:28.227 --> 1:35:30.425
"This is not my story."

1:35:34.101 --> 1:35:37.971
I know you... you
didn't write it.

1:35:39.535 --> 1:35:43.669
But you lived it.

1:35:44.980 --> 1:35:48.949
Every page, every line,
every word.

1:35:55.221 --> 1:35:57.188
Don't worry, Professor.

1:35:58.620 --> 1:35:59.927
This is a...

1:36:00.622 --> 1:36:01.896
a happy ending.

1:36:14.339 --> 1:36:16.504
For 25 years,

1:36:16.539 --> 1:36:20.475
the world has waited for

1:36:21.010 --> 1:36:25.821
Bruce Cogburn's
next masterpiece.

1:36:26.747 --> 1:36:27.955
And today,

1:36:29.189 --> 1:36:31.288
today is the day

1:36:31.657 --> 1:36:33.686
that we give it to them.

1:36:39.463 --> 1:36:40.495
Why are you doing this?

1:36:41.828 --> 1:36:47.139
I need to know that I am more
than a book...

1:36:50.045 --> 1:36:51.572
full of rage.

1:36:57.712 --> 1:36:59.712
I truly believed
that you had died.

1:37:03.025 --> 1:37:04.189
I was dead.

1:37:06.886 --> 1:37:09.359
For 19 minutes.

1:37:12.133 --> 1:37:15.937
Would you like to know
what I found on the other side?

1:37:18.502 --> 1:37:24.176
I... I found...

1:37:26.411 --> 1:37:27.542
nothing.

1:37:29.348 --> 1:37:31.711
My whole life, I...

1:37:31.979 --> 1:37:36.386
I blamed God for everything
that was

1:37:37.620 --> 1:37:39.290
wrong with me, and I...

1:37:40.359 --> 1:37:43.063
wanted so much
for the world to...

1:37:43.098 --> 1:37:46.759
to know Him the way
that I knew Him as a...

1:37:49.632 --> 1:37:51.467
a child,

1:37:53.207 --> 1:37:55.570
a cruel child with a...

1:37:56.672 --> 1:37:58.837
with a magnifying glass.

1:37:58.872 --> 1:38:02.379
And we are just the ants
that He plays with.

1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:06.779
But then...

1:38:08.519 --> 1:38:09.683
I died.

1:38:12.094 --> 1:38:14.556
And I realized...

1:38:18.232 --> 1:38:20.562
there is no child.

1:38:22.302 --> 1:38:25.864
There is no magnifying glass.

1:38:28.572 --> 1:38:30.902
There is only us ants.

1:38:33.577 --> 1:38:36.380
And we are the ones who

1:38:37.779 --> 1:38:39.119
started the fire.

1:38:41.156 --> 1:38:44.256
All those misguided gods,

1:38:44.291 --> 1:38:46.390
all those beliefs...

1:38:46.425 --> 1:38:50.966
...all bullshit.

1:39:30.436 --> 1:39:31.765
Oh, what is that?

1:39:34.869 --> 1:39:39.872
It's a letter.
Who is that

1:39:43.647 --> 1:39:44.712
To my agent.

1:39:56.528 --> 1:39:58.495
I'm done playing this part.

1:40:00.862 --> 1:40:04.171
What did you put in
that letter, Bruce?

1:40:09.673 --> 1:40:10.738
Bruce?

1:40:12.247 --> 1:40:13.246
Professor?

1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:17.349
Professor!

1:40:20.453 --> 1:40:22.288
What's in that letter?

1:40:24.919 --> 1:40:26.985
The truth, Elijah.

1:40:28.230 --> 1:40:29.262
It's the truth.

1:42:24.676 --> 1:42:25.675
Elijah?

1:42:27.646 --> 1:42:30.515
This is incredible writing.

1:42:31.518 --> 1:42:32.649
- <i> Thank you, Professor.</i>

1:42:33.218 --> 1:42:34.618
- <i> It's exquisite.</i>

1:42:34.653 --> 1:42:37.192
Now, bugger off.
Yes. Thank you.

1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:44.859
- <i> I'm serious, Elijah.</i>
<i>Everything I read of yours,</i>

1:42:45.161 --> 1:42:47.895
it's so surprising to me.
It's unpredictable.

1:42:48.799 --> 1:42:51.338
<i>You need to be</i>
<i>a professional writer.</i>

1:42:51.773 --> 1:42:54.770
What if I don't have
anything to say?

1:42:56.807 --> 1:42:58.345
- <i> Then you're</i>
<i>not digging deep enough.</i>

1:43:00.041 --> 1:43:01.073
Dig deep.

1:43:02.516 --> 1:43:03.515
<i>Elijah?</i>

1:43:06.388 --> 1:43:08.179
What do you think, Professor?

1:43:09.017 --> 1:43:10.225
I can't wait to read it.

1:43:11.558 --> 1:43:14.526
- Dig deep.<i> Dig deep.</i>

1:43:14.561 --> 1:43:17.562
- <i> What's that?</i>
Dig deep.

1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:23.095
<i>I don't think I could have dug</i>
<i>any deeper than this, Professor.</i>

1:43:26.265 --> 1:43:28.133
He's gonna be so mad at me.

1:43:28.401 --> 1:43:31.411
I'm... I'm supposed to wait.

1:43:32.113 --> 1:43:34.744
I don't know if I can wait.
Wait for what?

1:43:37.386 --> 1:43:38.418
<i>Wait for what, Elijah?</i>

1:43:44.118 --> 1:43:46.294
To see the look
on God's face.

1:43:50.927 --> 1:43:52.223
No!

1:43:54.865 --> 1:43:56.997
ELIJAH'-
<i>My wife and I agree that</i>

1:43:57.265 --> 1:43:59.736
<i>we need to end his suffering.</i>

1:44:00.438 --> 1:44:03.641
<i>Thank you for everything</i>
<i>you've done for our boy.</i>

1:44:04.479 --> 1:44:06.479
<i>I have to go.</i>
I'm so sorry.

1:44:07.581 --> 1:44:09.174
<i>I appreciate you telling me.</i>

1:44:46.488 --> 1:44:47.487
- <i> Who...</i>

1:44:48.523 --> 1:44:50.622
am I?

1:44:54.496 --> 1:44:55.660
<i>Who am I, really?</i>

1:45:00.700 --> 1:45:02.700
<i>That's the question</i>
<i>that every protagonist</i>

1:45:02.735 --> 1:45:05.835
<i>needs to answer</i>
<i>by the end of their story.</i>

1:45:07.641 --> 1:45:09.806
<i>If your hero hasn't reached</i>

1:45:10.175 --> 1:45:13.304
<i>some sort of cathartic</i>
<i>realization about who they are</i>

1:45:13.339 --> 1:45:16.681
<i>or what they believe in</i>
<i>by the last page,</i>

1:45:17.183 --> 1:45:19.618
<i>then I'm sorry to inform you,</i>
<i>ladies and gents,</i>

1:45:19.886 --> 1:45:21.081
you have failed your reader.

1:45:23.822 --> 1:45:26.856

<i>You're the only person</i>
<i>that gets me.</i>
