WONDROUS BOCCACCIO

01:47.908 --> 01:51.369
FLORENCE 1348
AT THE TIME OF THE PLAGUE

03:18.665 --> 03:20.667
I’m dying...

03:22.294 --> 03:24.504
without having enjoyed life...

03:24.588 --> 03:26.464
Not even...

03:28.466 --> 03:30.218
this much.

03:56.536 --> 04:00.290
I’ve lost a daughter,
I won’t have these two taken from me!

04:00.332 --> 04:02.542
- Keep away!
- You touched her!

04:02.626 --> 04:04.169
Keep away!

04:11.343 --> 04:13.553
Don’t come looking for us.

04:52.217 --> 04:54.219
I’m going with them, Lauretta.

04:54.886 --> 04:56.555
I’ll accompany them.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.557
I won’t abandon them.

05:00.016 --> 05:01.935
We’re done.

05:02.018 --> 05:04.062
We have to go.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.857
Not like that!
Don’t treat my family like that!

05:06.898 --> 05:08.400
Here, give him a hand.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.861
I want them close together.

05:10.902 --> 05:12.737
Side by side.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.006
No, no!

05:31.089 --> 05:33.425
- Come here!
- Come back up here!

05:33.466 --> 05:35.552
Come away!

05:35.594 --> 05:37.304
Come back here!

05:43.935 --> 05:46.813
We’re in a hurry, we’re paid to work.

05:46.897 --> 05:48.857
Get out!

05:48.940 --> 05:50.775
Or we’ll bury you too!

05:53.528 --> 05:56.072
He’s not the first to react this way.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.951
You saw them the other day.
At least two of them.

06:49.251 --> 06:51.878
- Shame on you!
- We’re not harming anyone!

06:51.962 --> 06:55.090
Many say the scent of flowers
keeps the plague away.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.723
I’ve got the plague, fair rose.

07:47.559 --> 07:49.978
Why shouldn’t you catch it too?

07:56.735 --> 07:58.153
Wait!

07:58.236 --> 08:00.238
Anna! Paola!

08:49.829 --> 08:52.666
- Are we all here?
- All except Elisabetta.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.547
I’m over here. I’m over here.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.465
I’m staying here!

09:00.507 --> 09:04.386
Elisabetta, all of us together, remember?

09:04.469 --> 09:06.638
We’ll save ourselves.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.306
We’re leaving.

09:11.643 --> 09:13.186
I’m staying here.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.988
If you can forget, I can’t.

09:24.155 --> 09:25.949
I’ll leave on my own tomorrow.

09:28.451 --> 09:31.246
You count the day’s dead in the evening.

09:31.955 --> 09:34.749
I’m going up into the hills,
in the open air.

09:35.417 --> 09:38.003
And if death finds me up there, so be it.

09:38.837 --> 09:42.382
What’s wrong, Fiammetta?
You were the most determined.

09:43.258 --> 09:44.759
To abandon everything...

09:44.843 --> 09:47.220
We ourselves have been abandoned!

09:47.762 --> 09:49.806
I know that.
Many of you know that.

09:49.848 --> 09:51.850
We can’t put it off any longer.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.830
We’ve been looking for you for days,
where were you?

10:13.872 --> 10:15.874
We even thought...

10:22.756 --> 10:25.467
Dioneo, Filostrato...

10:26.384 --> 10:27.677
Panfilo...

10:28.470 --> 10:30.639
we’re leaving Florence tomorrow.

10:33.558 --> 10:35.435
Will you come with us?

10:37.687 --> 10:39.189
Are you joking?

10:39.231 --> 10:41.650
We’ve decided we need some peace.

10:43.068 --> 10:45.654
These last few days have been...

10:46.404 --> 10:47.906
They’ve been...

10:49.699 --> 10:51.201
Come with us.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.755
Listen!

11:07.759 --> 11:10.512
We’ll meet at Holy Trinity bridge
two hours from now.

12:47.859 --> 12:50.028
Come over here!

12:55.992 --> 12:58.036
This is beautiful!

13:44.749 --> 13:46.501
Friends...

13:47.169 --> 13:49.171
what are you doing?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.174
What are we doing?

14:02.434 --> 14:06.188
Girls, your good judgment brought us here.

14:06.271 --> 14:09.065
I don’t know what you plan to do,
what you’re thinking.

14:09.691 --> 14:11.776
I left my worries down there.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.113
You did too, didn’t you, Fiammetta?

14:16.990 --> 14:19.784
We can spend
these days together pleasantly,

14:20.327 --> 14:22.329
or say farewell

14:22.412 --> 14:24.456
and return to Florence.

14:25.707 --> 14:27.292
Stay, Dioneo.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.461
For our friendship’s sake at least.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.255
We’re all very tired...

14:48.271 --> 14:51.566
Dioneo, I want what you want, we all do.

14:52.150 --> 14:55.278
Let’s give ourselves rules,
the days will be long.

14:56.821 --> 14:59.991
Neifile and Filomena
came up with a good idea.

15:00.534 --> 15:02.452
Tell them, Neifile.

15:02.994 --> 15:06.790
Every day we’ll tell a story,
we’ll all tell a different one.

15:06.831 --> 15:08.667
A good one.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.378
You might know some of them,
they’re a century old.

15:11.461 --> 15:14.840
Oh, God, I can’t even think of one.
What shall I do?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.675
I know a lot...

15:16.716 --> 15:20.720
but we’re free to choose
any topic we want, right?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.416
No, Dioneo.

15:52.669 --> 15:54.337
Don’t be angry.

15:54.379 --> 15:58.383
I think the three of us
should set another rule.

16:00.385 --> 16:01.887
No romancing.

16:04.639 --> 16:07.392
Then there’ll be no envy among the others.

16:15.567 --> 16:17.485
All right, please yourself!

16:18.528 --> 16:21.698
But no one can stop me
kissing my beloved right now.

16:22.199 --> 16:24.159
Then no more, I promise.

17:51.162 --> 17:53.248
Filomena, are you asleep?

17:53.331 --> 17:54.708
Listen!

18:33.705 --> 18:35.207
All right then...

18:36.291 --> 18:40.754
I’m really happy to be
the first to tell a story, about love

18:40.837 --> 18:42.547
and resurrection.

18:43.548 --> 18:45.383
It’s about the plague too.

18:46.218 --> 18:47.385
Forgive me,

18:47.427 --> 18:50.889
but you’ll see that he, and her too...

18:52.891 --> 18:54.434
This is my story:

18:54.518 --> 18:58.563
about Catalina, a very beautiful
and respectable wife.

18:58.647 --> 19:00.815
But she falls seriously ill.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.568
<i>But they don’t know what her sickness is.</i>

19:10.909 --> 19:12.702
<i>This is her husband, Nicoluccio,</i>

19:12.744 --> 19:15.372
<i>a good husband
and a successful merchant,</i>

19:15.413 --> 19:18.917
<i>but like everyone in that house,
he takes orders from his mother,</i>

19:18.959 --> 19:22.379
<i>Lady Lucrezia, who has ordered
the servant and doctor</i>

19:22.420 --> 19:25.298
<i>to take Catalina far away from them</i>

19:25.382 --> 19:27.175
<i>to their country house.</i>

19:28.176 --> 19:30.136
<i>She’s given the coachman the order.</i>

19:35.350 --> 19:37.686
<i>This is Master Gentile Carisendi,</i>

19:37.769 --> 19:39.688
<i>young, handsome and distraught.</i>

19:39.771 --> 19:42.065
<i>He was touched by the plague,
but he survived.</i>

19:43.483 --> 19:45.777
<i>For days he’s waited below the window</i>

19:45.819 --> 19:48.488
<i>where the woman he loves might die,</i>

19:48.572 --> 19:50.949
<i>the woman he has always loved.</i>

20:21.980 --> 20:25.400
If we don’t get her out of here,
we’ll all perish!

20:49.716 --> 20:53.678
<i>While they were taking Catalina
far away from her home,</i>

20:53.720 --> 20:57.224
<i>the doctor and servant
witnessed her death.</i>

20:58.975 --> 21:02.187
<i>They stopped, but didn’t turn back.</i>

21:05.232 --> 21:09.027
<i>They left her in the crypt
of an abandoned church.</i>

21:21.748 --> 21:24.084
Doctor, I won’t get into trouble for this?

21:24.167 --> 21:26.336
No, the sooner you bury them,

21:26.378 --> 21:29.548
the more grateful
their relatives and friends are.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.883
- Where did you put her?
- Where do you think?

21:31.967 --> 21:34.511
On top of the slab.

25:24.366 --> 25:26.618
I realized she was still alive.

25:27.452 --> 25:30.121
- Alive?
- Yes, I’ve brought her here.

25:42.467 --> 25:44.553
Do you love her that much?

25:48.765 --> 25:50.308
Look at me.

25:52.811 --> 25:54.145
Yes...

25:55.021 --> 25:56.940
I know you.

25:57.649 --> 25:59.192
You do.

26:14.332 --> 26:16.334
No, you can see her later.

26:18.628 --> 26:21.423
Go back to your room...

26:21.923 --> 26:23.592
and wait.

26:56.291 --> 26:58.335
Who are you?

27:03.465 --> 27:06.927
- Am I alive or dead?
- You’re a little dazed, but alive.

27:09.179 --> 27:12.307
You’re with friends, don’t be afraid.

27:12.390 --> 27:16.061
Yes, you have fought off your illness.

27:16.561 --> 27:18.522
My doctor examined you,

27:18.563 --> 27:21.733
he says you’re weak but you’ll get better.

27:27.572 --> 27:29.699
And we will help you.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.910
I won’t touch you, if you don’t want.

27:32.827 --> 27:35.539
The plague has been kind.

27:35.580 --> 27:37.999
It’s kept away from our valley.

27:38.583 --> 27:43.338
And everyone’s saying
it’s now leaving Florence too.

28:23.962 --> 28:27.549
Good morning, Catalina.
Sorry for coming into your room.

28:30.969 --> 28:33.096
There, I won’t look at you.

28:33.889 --> 28:35.682
But let me speak.

28:36.349 --> 28:40.478
You know why you’re here in our home,
my mother’s told you everything.

28:43.690 --> 28:47.319
And you’ve known of my love for some time.

28:50.488 --> 28:54.826
But for God to use this love of mine
to bring you back to life...

28:56.203 --> 28:57.996
it amazes me.

28:59.164 --> 29:00.665
Really.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.835
And I am grateful to Him.

29:07.672 --> 29:09.382
So am I.

29:10.091 --> 29:12.093
But I would ask you a favor.

29:12.177 --> 29:15.597
Remain here until you are well.

29:18.558 --> 29:20.268
Why?

29:21.186 --> 29:23.813
Your family believes you dead,

29:23.855 --> 29:26.525
and there’s no one waiting
for you at home.

29:26.608 --> 29:28.109
That’s why.

29:29.986 --> 29:31.863
I don’t understand.

29:33.073 --> 29:38.703
I want to give your husband
a wonderful surprise.

29:39.871 --> 29:41.498
Me and you...

29:42.207 --> 29:44.709
No, I’ll come no closer.

29:46.211 --> 29:48.547
I will organize a banquet here...

29:48.588 --> 29:50.465
outside in the grounds.

29:51.383 --> 29:54.845
I will invite your friends and mine.

29:54.886 --> 29:56.972
From Florence.

31:45.705 --> 31:47.916
Let’s have a go at this game.

31:49.835 --> 31:51.336
You try.

32:00.846 --> 32:02.347
Well done!

32:42.512 --> 32:44.055
Leave us.

32:45.557 --> 32:46.975
Friends...

32:48.268 --> 32:50.437
you have honored my table,

32:51.062 --> 32:53.732
and I wish to honor you too.

32:54.733 --> 32:58.737
I want you to meet the person
I love most in the world.

33:00.530 --> 33:02.032
But first...

33:02.574 --> 33:05.076
I’d like you to clear up a doubt I have.

33:06.953 --> 33:08.496
Right...

33:09.623 --> 33:13.126
a gentleman has in his home...

33:13.835 --> 33:15.962
a kind and loyal servant

33:17.130 --> 33:19.132
who falls seriously ill.

33:19.716 --> 33:22.969
And this gentleman,
without waiting for the end,

33:23.053 --> 33:25.597
takes him into the street
and abandons him there.

33:28.266 --> 33:30.393
A stranger, moved by compassion,

33:30.435 --> 33:32.521
takes him to his home,

33:33.146 --> 33:34.648
and he’s cured.

33:36.358 --> 33:37.901
Now then...

33:38.735 --> 33:41.196
if the first gentleman

33:41.279 --> 33:43.823
wishes to take his servant back

33:43.907 --> 33:46.785
and the second refuses to let him...

33:49.120 --> 33:51.331
who do you think is right?

33:57.838 --> 34:02.259
I have been entrusted with the task
of giving you an answer,

34:02.968 --> 34:04.845
because in their opinion...

34:04.928 --> 34:07.264
you are quite wrong, my friends...

34:07.305 --> 34:10.642
I am a good... speaker.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.061
It’s Nicoluccio!

34:21.486 --> 34:23.905
How can I go out there now?

34:23.989 --> 34:25.949
We all agree.

34:25.991 --> 34:29.744
The first gentleman, the one
who abandoned his sick servant

34:30.537 --> 34:33.164
and left him in the street, was wrong.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.669
Because of the kindness received,

34:37.711 --> 34:40.505
the servant should remain
with the second gentleman.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.675
Good.

34:43.717 --> 34:47.012
Then it’s time I kept my promise.

35:05.488 --> 35:06.948
Friends...

35:07.824 --> 35:10.035
this is the woman I hold dearest.

35:10.994 --> 35:13.371
Tell me if I’m right to want her.

35:31.097 --> 35:34.392
It’s the dead woman!
The dead woman!

35:34.476 --> 35:36.895
- Catalina!
- Friends, wait!

35:36.937 --> 35:39.523
Listen, let me explain!

35:40.065 --> 35:43.318
This woman is the loyal servant
I spoke of.

35:43.401 --> 35:46.696
Yes, Catalina, I took her in
and snatched her from death.

35:46.738 --> 35:50.158
She’s mine now, and no one
can take her away from me.

35:55.288 --> 35:57.249
But she must decide.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.601
You’ve come from hell.

37:43.313 --> 37:44.689
No.

37:46.358 --> 37:48.985
I’ve come from Paradise.

38:10.757 --> 38:12.259
There!

38:14.594 --> 38:16.221
Well done!

38:17.472 --> 38:19.432
That was a fine story.

38:30.652 --> 38:34.489
It’s nice, but I don’t want
to be like Catalina.

38:35.073 --> 38:37.617
Look at me and listen to what I say.

38:38.285 --> 38:41.413
If I were to die before you...

38:42.038 --> 38:44.332
stay away from my body,

38:44.416 --> 38:46.668
and don’t touch my cold breasts.

38:53.133 --> 38:55.802
Have someone cover me with a white sheet.

38:55.886 --> 38:57.971
Linen preferably, and say goodbye.

38:59.556 --> 39:01.349
You, my love, must flee.

39:01.433 --> 39:03.476
Seek a place far from everyone

39:03.560 --> 39:05.520
and think of me from there.

39:17.782 --> 39:19.784
Come inside the house.

39:49.940 --> 39:51.983
It’s very hot today, everyone.

39:52.484 --> 39:55.278
I’ll cheer you up with a pleasant story.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.864
Yesterday we had a gloomy one,

39:57.948 --> 40:01.326
today we will travel
to a playful Florence.

40:02.911 --> 40:05.163
So just picture

40:05.789 --> 40:08.959
one of our artists’ workshops, where...

40:10.001 --> 40:11.670
<i>Calandrino worked.</i>

40:13.171 --> 40:17.884
<i>He was a bit of a dolt, a fool.</i>

40:17.968 --> 40:20.178
<i>He couldn’t see past the end of his nose.</i>

40:20.262 --> 40:25.141
He was always being teased
by two cunning painters,

40:25.183 --> 40:26.184
<i>Bruno and Buffalmacco.</i>

40:26.268 --> 40:27.644
Bruno.

40:28.395 --> 40:30.146
Look at Calandrino.

40:30.188 --> 40:32.440
- What a chump!
- He’s so clumsy.

40:32.524 --> 40:35.777
What’s he done with that gold leaf?
They should fire him.

40:35.861 --> 40:38.989
He adores you,
he considers you his master!

40:39.030 --> 40:40.574
You know that?

40:46.872 --> 40:49.040
I wonder what he thinks about.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.960
I don’t understand him.

40:55.172 --> 40:57.340
What are you doing?

40:57.382 --> 40:59.384
That’s not right.

41:00.677 --> 41:04.055
And this scribbling won’t do either.

41:04.097 --> 41:06.641
Look at your pupil with Master Andrea.

41:08.101 --> 41:09.895
He’ll get on his knees now.

41:10.896 --> 41:12.397
I told you.

41:13.732 --> 41:16.359
Come on, let go.

41:16.401 --> 41:18.695
Go on, get back to work.

41:28.038 --> 41:29.497
Bruno...

41:40.425 --> 41:43.428
What did you say that stone was called?

41:43.470 --> 41:45.639
Heliotrope.

41:45.722 --> 41:48.183
It gets its name from the sun

41:48.266 --> 41:52.020
because its magic powers
come from the sun’s rays.

41:52.103 --> 41:55.357
- And he who finds it...
- Becomes invisible.

41:56.441 --> 41:58.026
Invisible?

41:59.110 --> 42:02.656
I don’t believe that, Buffalmacco!
They were fooling you.

42:02.739 --> 42:06.493
Perhaps, but the mason who works there...

42:06.576 --> 42:09.162
- At Monte Morello?
- He’s a friend, an honest man.

42:09.246 --> 42:10.747
He says they found it there.

42:10.789 --> 42:14.125
- He did?
- No, a friend of his.

42:14.167 --> 42:17.045
He was so happy,
he showed it to everybody...

42:17.128 --> 42:19.881
- Then what happened?
- No one knows.

42:19.965 --> 42:22.425
- What do you mean?
- He vanished.

42:22.467 --> 42:24.094
Vanished?

42:24.135 --> 42:26.763
- What does this stone look like?
- All we know is it’s black.

42:26.805 --> 42:29.975
Forgive me for interrupting...

42:30.058 --> 42:33.311
but this stone...

42:34.312 --> 42:35.981
this stone!

42:37.566 --> 42:41.027
- This stone...
- What does it look like?

42:41.111 --> 42:43.071
It comes in all shapes.

42:44.322 --> 42:46.491
And they’re all black.

42:48.618 --> 42:50.871
And you only find them at Monte Morello?

42:50.954 --> 42:53.331
No, you can find them here too.

42:53.373 --> 42:55.500
Where exactly?

42:55.542 --> 42:59.045
I hear they found one
on the bed of the River Mugnone.

42:59.129 --> 43:01.047
The Mugnone!

43:06.928 --> 43:07.929
Mugnone...

43:08.513 --> 43:10.182
Buffalmacco!

43:11.308 --> 43:14.936
- Shall we go to the Mugnone?
- No, it’s too hot.

43:15.020 --> 43:18.231
Good, the black stones will stand out
from the dry white ones.

43:18.315 --> 43:20.859
Let’s go and look for this stone...

43:20.942 --> 43:23.612
this... what’s it called?

43:23.695 --> 43:25.197
Heliotrope.

43:26.573 --> 43:28.533
We’ll strike it rich.

44:02.984 --> 44:04.569
Calandrino!

44:05.695 --> 44:07.572
We’ve had no luck.

44:44.067 --> 44:45.652
Bruno...

44:46.611 --> 44:48.363
where’s Calandrino?

45:02.878 --> 45:05.964
I don’t know.
He was here a moment ago!

45:13.430 --> 45:15.432
There’s the church bell, Buffalmacco.

45:15.932 --> 45:17.475
It’s time to eat.

45:17.517 --> 45:20.312
That’s where Calandrino will be,
having lunch.

45:21.646 --> 45:25.483
He couldn’t find a stone,
so he left us here to go insane.

45:32.824 --> 45:35.327
Let’s go. Let’s head back.

45:36.411 --> 45:38.163
Yes, I’ll come too.

45:38.663 --> 45:41.374
But I swear if that rogue were here now...

45:41.458 --> 45:43.835
I would throw this black stone at him!

45:49.508 --> 45:51.384
Look how nice this stone is!

45:51.468 --> 45:53.845
I’d throw it at his back!

46:53.905 --> 46:54.990
What’s wrong?

46:57.450 --> 46:59.744
Pretend you can’t see him!

46:59.786 --> 47:03.415
Calandrino’s coming this way.
Your eyes must not see him!

47:13.091 --> 47:15.010
Young maid!

47:18.054 --> 47:20.432
Pretend you can’t see him.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.393
Go inside!

47:23.435 --> 47:25.187
Master Andrea!

47:28.607 --> 47:30.108
No!

47:35.197 --> 47:38.325
Bruno, is Calandrino coming now?

47:38.408 --> 47:39.910
- Yes.
- I’m in!

48:57.362 --> 48:58.864
Thank you!

51:38.315 --> 51:40.192
Calandrino, is that you?

51:46.072 --> 51:47.741
Did you get lost?

51:47.824 --> 51:50.702
Everyone else has had their lunch,
and now you come home.

51:57.042 --> 51:58.543
You can see me...

51:59.586 --> 52:02.380
- You can see me!
- Of course.

52:02.422 --> 52:05.383
Why shouldn’t I be able to see you?

52:07.594 --> 52:09.679
You’ve ruined everything.

52:09.721 --> 52:11.389
You’ve ruined everything!

52:12.390 --> 52:14.267
Wicked woman!

52:16.228 --> 52:17.812
She’s a witch!

52:20.065 --> 52:21.900
You’re a witch!

52:26.071 --> 52:29.699
You’ve taken away the magic
from the black stone!

52:38.124 --> 52:42.128
I’ll teach you! I’ll teach you!

52:42.212 --> 52:45.131
Curse you, daughter of the devil!

52:45.215 --> 52:48.260
Curse you, daughter of the devil!

53:42.981 --> 53:45.192
Tessa, have you already eaten?

54:25.732 --> 54:28.443
Listen to me!

54:28.527 --> 54:31.363
I know what you’d have done,
but it didn’t happen.

54:31.404 --> 54:33.907
Bruno and Buffalmacco
got there just in time.

54:33.990 --> 54:35.534
They saved Calandrino,

54:35.617 --> 54:38.537
and with great difficulty
reconciled husband and wife.

54:38.578 --> 54:40.705
Nice story, except for the ending.

54:41.373 --> 54:43.291
Here’s our ending!

54:46.127 --> 54:47.629
Right!

54:50.382 --> 54:53.260
For every end you need a finale!

55:09.276 --> 55:11.069
Friends!

55:15.073 --> 55:17.242
Have you forgotten?

55:22.080 --> 55:25.417
- We need to bake some bread.
- I’m coming!

55:39.639 --> 55:44.352
I just wanted to say I know a bit
about farmhouse chores.

55:44.436 --> 55:46.438
My grandparents were country folks.

55:46.980 --> 55:50.942
And when I was a child, in summer,
I would watch them baking.

55:51.735 --> 55:54.946
So, if you trust me, I can help you.

55:55.739 --> 55:57.908
Yes, give us a hand.

55:58.867 --> 56:00.702
Thanks.

56:01.870 --> 56:04.664
You, Pampinea, Neifile, and Lauretta,

56:04.748 --> 56:07.250
fetch the flour
and spread it on the tables.

56:07.292 --> 56:09.544
Filomena, Emilia, you bring some water.

56:09.628 --> 56:13.924
Fiammetta, it’s your home,
find us some yeast.

56:13.965 --> 56:17.135
Filostrato, you’re the strongest,
you will chop the wood.

56:17.177 --> 56:21.473
Dioneo and Panfilo,
you will light the oven.

56:21.556 --> 56:23.308
Let’s get started!

56:43.328 --> 56:44.829
Just look at them!

56:46.998 --> 56:49.251
You’d think
they’d always been peasant girls.

56:51.378 --> 56:53.630
You only need the first letters.

56:53.672 --> 56:56.174
- Name or surname?
- As you wish.

57:08.979 --> 57:11.857
I’d rather have you underneath,
not the loaf.

57:12.858 --> 57:14.860
We’ve been fasting too long.

57:14.901 --> 57:18.238
“Eating without drinking,
is like bricklaying without cement.”

57:18.321 --> 57:21.950
Listen to mine: “When Bacchus
triumphs, all worries flee!”

57:23.660 --> 57:25.495
I wish, Emilia.

57:25.537 --> 57:27.622
I drink...

57:27.706 --> 57:31.042
but all my worries stay with me.

57:31.084 --> 57:32.878
So do mine.

57:33.545 --> 57:36.590
I’ve said something stupid, I’m sorry.

57:50.937 --> 57:54.149
But the devil has
the right proverb for us!

57:54.232 --> 57:56.109
“He who eats and drinks well,

57:56.193 --> 57:59.321
craps at length and fears not death!”

58:33.772 --> 58:37.776
Duke Tancredi only had
one daughter, Ghismunda.

58:37.817 --> 58:41.530
He loved her so much
he didn’t want to marry her off.

58:41.613 --> 58:44.824
But then for reasons of status,
he found her a husband,

58:44.908 --> 58:46.952
noble and elderly.

58:47.953 --> 58:51.122
After the marriage
Tancredi became melancholy.

58:53.083 --> 58:54.835
But today,

58:54.918 --> 58:56.795
seven years later,

58:57.796 --> 59:00.549
Ghismunda is returning to him, a widow.

59:04.678 --> 59:08.265
<i>Tancredi’s only consolation
during those seven years</i>

59:08.306 --> 59:12.352
<i>was his affection for Guiscardo,
a young man of humble origin,</i>

59:12.435 --> 59:15.689
<i>but a master in the working
of steel, silver and gold.</i>

59:33.623 --> 59:34.833
Hey there!

59:38.670 --> 59:40.589
You let me win.

59:42.340 --> 59:46.303
But I’m not for the trash heap,
I’m not that old.

59:46.845 --> 59:48.597
You look rejuvenated!

59:48.680 --> 59:50.849
Happiness is the best medicine.

59:51.683 --> 59:53.810
It makes one’s face more handsome.

59:55.187 --> 59:57.480
And I was testing my new sword.

1:00:00.233 --> 1:00:01.776
It’s a fine one.

1:00:01.860 --> 1:00:04.029
Light but easy to handle.

1:00:04.070 --> 1:00:07.115
I surely would have won with this.

1:00:09.326 --> 1:00:11.119
What’s that?

1:00:14.539 --> 1:00:17.292
It’s a gift for your daughter Ghismunda.

1:00:18.251 --> 1:00:19.794
It’s nice.

1:00:20.545 --> 1:00:23.423
Well done, Guiscardo.
You’re a bright boy.

1:00:23.507 --> 1:00:25.967
A fine swordsman and a fine craftsman.

1:00:28.094 --> 1:00:31.181
Ghismunda will drink our milk
from this cup.

1:01:08.885 --> 1:01:10.971
Thank you, Father.

1:01:11.054 --> 1:01:14.140
Come here, talk to me.

1:01:14.224 --> 1:01:16.810
- Do you remember?
- Do I remember?

1:01:16.893 --> 1:01:19.145
You’ve no idea how many times
when I was far away

1:01:19.229 --> 1:01:22.357
I’ve thought of our special corner.

1:01:23.859 --> 1:01:25.694
But not today.

1:01:25.777 --> 1:01:28.780
Don’t be upset,
but I want to be on my own today.

1:01:28.822 --> 1:01:31.283
My husband has only been dead a few days.

1:01:32.576 --> 1:01:36.121
But he was an old man,
and you didn’t love him.

1:01:36.162 --> 1:01:38.290
- Did you?
- That’s right.

1:01:39.249 --> 1:01:41.501
But now he’s gone, he is dear to me.

1:01:42.002 --> 1:01:44.629
He was kind to me, and I respect him.

1:01:45.839 --> 1:01:49.301
I will mourn him for a month
and keep to my chamber.

1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:52.387
Please be patient.

1:01:54.472 --> 1:01:56.308
Patience is for the elderly.

1:01:57.017 --> 1:01:59.644
You don’t think I’m that old,
do you, Ghismunda?

1:02:01.479 --> 1:02:03.481
Then let me stay here.

1:02:15.535 --> 1:02:17.245
You want me to leave?

1:02:18.330 --> 1:02:19.873
Really?

1:02:20.540 --> 1:02:21.750
Yes.

1:02:21.833 --> 1:02:23.460
Is that so?

1:02:23.502 --> 1:02:25.337
Is that so?

1:02:40.018 --> 1:02:42.354
A MONTH LATER

1:02:43.522 --> 1:02:45.023
Look at me.

1:02:45.106 --> 1:02:47.901
- Do I look pretty?
- Yes.

1:02:51.321 --> 1:02:53.865
- Is my mantle pretty?
- Yes.

1:03:09.589 --> 1:03:11.091
Here she is.

1:03:12.133 --> 1:03:16.930
I would die of envy if I saw
a father with such a daughter.

1:03:23.353 --> 1:03:25.063
Now arrange a good marriage for her.

1:03:25.146 --> 1:03:27.274
This is no time for marriage!

1:03:27.357 --> 1:03:29.150
She’s staying here.

1:03:45.709 --> 1:03:47.752
She won’t give it to him.

1:03:49.754 --> 1:03:52.883
She’s a cheeky little swallow,
she won’t let him have it.

1:04:37.802 --> 1:04:41.640
The man with the swallows,
is he your protégé?

1:04:41.681 --> 1:04:43.934
That’s Guiscardo.

1:04:43.975 --> 1:04:48.647
Make me happy and go and thank him
for the cup he gave you.

1:04:52.025 --> 1:04:54.236
He’s really ingenious, but so uncouth.

1:04:54.319 --> 1:04:57.697
- Uncouth? Why?
- The language he uses.

1:04:57.781 --> 1:05:00.325
You heard him this morning in the square!

1:05:01.368 --> 1:05:03.495
The swallows romancing!

1:05:06.206 --> 1:05:07.207
He’s uncouth!

1:05:07.290 --> 1:05:10.669
You’re right, he goes too far sometimes,
and I lose my patience...

1:05:11.837 --> 1:05:14.506
but he’s so creative...

1:05:15.382 --> 1:05:18.343
You should see the crest
he’s working on for us.

1:05:19.261 --> 1:05:21.847
Pity I will lose him one of these days.

1:05:22.806 --> 1:05:24.808
Why will you lose him?

1:05:24.850 --> 1:05:27.978
He’s too talented,
word has gotten out to the workshops.

1:05:32.732 --> 1:05:36.319
You brought him up, educated him,
and you’d let him go?

1:05:39.573 --> 1:05:43.535
- It’s not like you.
- I’m happy for him.

1:05:43.618 --> 1:05:45.287
He deserves it.

1:05:46.997 --> 1:05:49.124
May Florence admire him!

1:06:13.481 --> 1:06:15.483
I’ve been expecting you.

1:06:17.903 --> 1:06:19.905
- Why?
- Why?

1:06:19.946 --> 1:06:22.991
No reason.
You’re here, that’s all that matters.

1:06:30.916 --> 1:06:34.169
Is this the crest?
My father told me about it.

1:06:34.252 --> 1:06:36.379
He’s right, it’s lovely.

1:06:36.421 --> 1:06:38.590
No it’s not, it’s awful.

1:06:39.758 --> 1:06:42.594
It’s my 100th attempt,
there’s too much on it.

1:06:42.636 --> 1:06:45.931
- There’s no central idea.
- But it’s imaginative.

1:06:47.140 --> 1:06:49.226
You shouldn’t have looked, it’s crap.

1:06:49.267 --> 1:06:52.687
Why must an artist be so uncouth?

1:07:02.113 --> 1:07:04.199
You made this with love, didn’t you?

1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:07.327
Yes, Ghismunda.

1:07:08.745 --> 1:07:10.789
I’d like to act indifferent, but...

1:07:11.665 --> 1:07:14.709
this horse was forged by torment...

1:07:14.793 --> 1:07:17.128
I’d make a mistake
and lie awake all night.

1:07:17.212 --> 1:07:19.673
But I’d have happy awakenings too.

1:07:23.093 --> 1:07:25.303
Don’t go to Florence.

1:07:39.359 --> 1:07:40.861
Come here!

1:07:43.738 --> 1:07:44.739
Come with me.

1:08:24.029 --> 1:08:26.072
It’s my room!

1:08:39.044 --> 1:08:41.755
I’m looking at it through your eyes,

1:08:41.838 --> 1:08:43.798
and it looks beautiful.

1:08:43.882 --> 1:08:45.717
Much more beautiful.

1:10:46.213 --> 1:10:47.756
Don’t run away.

1:10:48.465 --> 1:10:49.966
Don’t run away.

1:11:03.522 --> 1:11:05.273
I thought so too.

1:11:06.691 --> 1:11:09.236
I have a lump in my throat, Guiscardo.

1:11:09.319 --> 1:11:10.820
I want to cry.

1:11:10.862 --> 1:11:12.572
Why?

1:11:12.656 --> 1:11:14.282
Are you frightened?

1:11:14.366 --> 1:11:16.493
Of whom? Of what?

1:11:17.285 --> 1:11:19.371
I’m happy here with you.

1:11:22.874 --> 1:11:23.875
Me too.

1:11:23.917 --> 1:11:25.961
I want nothing else.

1:11:26.545 --> 1:11:28.755
Only to be with you.

1:11:32.759 --> 1:11:34.511
What about your father?

1:11:35.262 --> 1:11:36.888
I don’t know.

1:11:36.972 --> 1:11:39.724
I don’t love anyone anymore, only you.

1:11:40.267 --> 1:11:41.810
Or rather...

1:11:42.936 --> 1:11:44.771
I love everyone.

1:11:44.855 --> 1:11:46.356
Everyone!

1:12:03.582 --> 1:12:05.333
Hey there.

1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:17.512
Why did you do this to me?

1:12:19.389 --> 1:12:22.184
- Now I...
- I know what awaits me.

1:12:26.021 --> 1:12:28.523
But, sire...

1:12:30.233 --> 1:12:33.862
what can we do when love strikes?

1:12:35.864 --> 1:12:37.490
Nothing.

1:12:38.700 --> 1:12:40.202
Nothing.

1:12:40.785 --> 1:12:43.788
If you do him harm, my lord...

1:12:45.290 --> 1:12:47.876
you’ll hurt yourself even more.

1:13:32.045 --> 1:13:34.422
What must I do with you?

1:13:34.506 --> 1:13:37.175
You can’t imagine how much I love you.

1:13:37.717 --> 1:13:41.555
A father can’t do any more,
or rather he mustn’t do any more.

1:13:45.100 --> 1:13:47.102
You know my disposition.

1:13:47.769 --> 1:13:51.314
Those who offend me must be wiped out.

1:13:51.982 --> 1:13:55.068
He must be wiped out.

1:13:55.610 --> 1:13:58.154
But as for you, before I decide,

1:13:58.196 --> 1:14:02.075
I want to know
what you’ve got to say to me.

1:14:08.540 --> 1:14:10.125
Tancredi...

1:14:12.377 --> 1:14:15.213
I won’t answer you
to beg you or to deny it.

1:14:17.716 --> 1:14:19.968
I have loved Guiscardo,

1:14:20.051 --> 1:14:22.095
and for as long as I live...

1:14:23.013 --> 1:14:25.390
which won’t be for long, I will love him.

1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:29.227
And if love exists after death...

1:14:31.354 --> 1:14:33.440
I will love him still.

1:14:41.907 --> 1:14:43.408
You’re made of flesh,

1:14:43.450 --> 1:14:45.911
your daughter’s
made of flesh, not stone.

1:14:48.538 --> 1:14:52.125
You can’t have forgotten
the pleasures of youth.

1:14:53.543 --> 1:14:56.046
I experienced them in my marriage bed,

1:14:57.047 --> 1:15:00.300
I sought them out again,
and you helped me find them.

1:15:01.092 --> 1:15:04.012
You sang the virtues of Guiscardo.

1:15:06.473 --> 1:15:08.558
I have found them again, Tancredi.

1:15:21.154 --> 1:15:24.991
I mean no disrespect
by calling you by name.

1:15:26.701 --> 1:15:30.205
But can I go on loving
a father who now wants...

1:15:30.747 --> 1:15:32.958
What was it you said?

1:15:32.999 --> 1:15:35.085
To “wipe out” his favorite.

1:15:42.092 --> 1:15:44.427
You don’t know what to do with me?

1:15:44.469 --> 1:15:46.805
Don’t worry about it,

1:15:46.847 --> 1:15:49.140
what you do to him and not to me...

1:15:50.642 --> 1:15:52.811
I will do with my own hands.

1:16:03.697 --> 1:16:05.323
Father...

1:16:06.950 --> 1:16:08.743
you won’t do it...

1:16:36.146 --> 1:16:37.772
She’s a woman,

1:16:37.856 --> 1:16:40.025
he’ll vanish from her sight,

1:16:40.108 --> 1:16:42.277
and she will forget him.

1:16:47.199 --> 1:16:51.244
Strangle him, and bring me his heart.

1:16:59.211 --> 1:17:01.963
The next morning a servant came to me

1:17:02.047 --> 1:17:06.301
and brought me the gold cup
my father had ordered for me,

1:17:07.177 --> 1:17:09.554
the one Guiscardo had made.

1:17:11.264 --> 1:17:13.225
Inside it was his heart.

1:17:14.059 --> 1:17:16.811
I washed it with my tears and kissed it.

1:17:17.812 --> 1:17:21.441
I poured in the poisoned herbs
I had picked that morning.

1:17:23.860 --> 1:17:25.445
And I drank.

1:17:27.739 --> 1:17:29.449
I dried my eyes.

1:17:30.325 --> 1:17:33.870
I didn’t want to go to Guiscardo
with tears on my cheeks.

1:17:36.581 --> 1:17:38.834
I lay down on the bed without fear.

1:17:41.044 --> 1:17:44.130
When... I don’t remember, at dawn...

1:17:45.423 --> 1:17:47.133
I felt a hand

1:17:47.926 --> 1:17:49.636
on my hair.

1:17:50.428 --> 1:17:52.764
It was my father’s hand.

1:17:52.848 --> 1:17:54.349
He was there.

1:18:03.817 --> 1:18:05.610
Forgive me.

1:18:06.945 --> 1:18:08.613
Forgive you?

1:18:11.783 --> 1:18:12.951
Yes...

1:18:16.621 --> 1:18:18.206
forgive you.

1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:46.026
Her face had softened again.

1:18:48.111 --> 1:18:50.030
She seemed to be smiling...

1:18:51.865 --> 1:18:54.993
when they buried her next to Guiscardo.

1:18:56.161 --> 1:18:58.371
According to her family’s wishes.

1:19:02.959 --> 1:19:04.503
I’ve finished.

1:19:26.816 --> 1:19:29.236
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

1:19:30.195 --> 1:19:33.073
- No more sadness!
- What did you say?

1:19:33.156 --> 1:19:35.408
Come on, I’m going for a swim.

1:19:35.492 --> 1:19:37.619
There’s a lake down there.

1:19:37.702 --> 1:19:40.455
- What?
- The ladies’ lake.

1:19:40.539 --> 1:19:42.707
- That’s what the peasants call it.
- Why’s that?

1:19:42.749 --> 1:19:45.293
I don’t know.
It’s a nice name, isn’t it?

1:20:19.578 --> 1:20:24.374
You almost made us feel guilty
when you wept before.

1:20:25.333 --> 1:20:27.961
I hope this one will make you laugh.

1:20:28.044 --> 1:20:30.589
Well, you should know
that not far from here,

1:20:31.548 --> 1:20:33.300
perhaps over there,

1:20:33.383 --> 1:20:36.261
was a convent famous for its holiness.

1:20:36.803 --> 1:20:39.639
To be honest, not many nuns
had a real vocation,

1:20:39.723 --> 1:20:42.184
most were sent there by powerful families.

1:20:42.267 --> 1:20:44.102
You know that, right?

1:20:44.936 --> 1:20:48.190
All destined for the convent
from childhood.

1:20:54.070 --> 1:20:58.617
<i>Like Isabetta, unaware
of the odd future that awaited her.</i>

1:21:00.368 --> 1:21:03.288
<i>Like Usimbalda, the future abbess.</i>

1:21:08.126 --> 1:21:10.212
<i>And what an abbess she was!</i>

1:21:24.309 --> 1:21:26.978
<i>Isabetta was the prettiest nun
in the convent</i>

1:21:28.021 --> 1:21:29.981
<i>and the unhappiest.</i>

1:21:39.157 --> 1:21:43.411
<i>One morning Isabetta went to greet
her family at the grating,</i>

1:21:44.204 --> 1:21:47.082
<i>and she fell in love with Leonetto,</i>

1:21:47.165 --> 1:21:48.667
<i>the handsome Leonetto</i>

1:21:48.708 --> 1:21:51.086
<i>who had gone to visit with them.</i>

1:23:15.295 --> 1:23:17.005
What’s the matter?

1:23:30.936 --> 1:23:34.606
- What’s the matter?
- We must call the abbess!

1:23:34.648 --> 1:23:37.108
Isabetta has done something terrible!

1:23:37.150 --> 1:23:38.401
Let’s go!

1:23:43.615 --> 1:23:45.283
Quiet!

1:23:46.451 --> 1:23:49.371
Don’t make a noise, or they’ll run away.

1:24:04.427 --> 1:24:09.516
How dare you wake up your abbess
in the dead of night?

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:12.936
- A man...
- A naked man.

1:24:16.815 --> 1:24:19.484
- Where?
- With Sister Isabetta.

1:24:19.568 --> 1:24:20.569
Naked.

1:24:22.195 --> 1:24:23.905
Wait!

1:25:07.574 --> 1:25:09.075
Are you all right?

1:25:09.701 --> 1:25:11.536
Can you breathe?

1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:24.549
My long johns!

1:25:25.717 --> 1:25:27.260
Usimbalda...

1:25:29.095 --> 1:25:31.389
My long johns on her head!

1:25:43.068 --> 1:25:45.612
Keep your eyes to the floor.

1:26:24.818 --> 1:26:26.736
On your knees.

1:26:26.778 --> 1:26:28.613
Cursed by God!

1:26:32.284 --> 1:26:34.119
Go on, tremble...

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:39.165
In some corner of hell
they’re making room for you.

1:26:58.685 --> 1:27:00.312
Forgive me.

1:27:03.607 --> 1:27:07.068
What sin could be more shameful

1:27:07.152 --> 1:27:09.571
than to ruin the reputation of this convent,

1:27:09.654 --> 1:27:12.157
sanctified over centuries?

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:15.202
Your own convent, my daughters.

1:27:15.285 --> 1:27:19.122
You honor it with your prayers,
with your purity,

1:27:19.706 --> 1:27:23.502
and this sister of yours
has sullied it with her shame.

1:27:27.714 --> 1:27:31.843
And we’re supposed to blush
before the eyes of God and the world

1:27:31.885 --> 1:27:34.012
for your sake?

1:27:34.679 --> 1:27:36.765
We can make you disappear,

1:27:36.848 --> 1:27:39.643
you’ve no idea what we can do.

1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:46.858
And now dare to look me in the eye...

1:27:58.370 --> 1:28:00.330
Mother...

1:28:00.372 --> 1:28:02.207
may God help you...

1:28:03.667 --> 1:28:06.837
fasten those ties that are hanging down.

1:28:07.879 --> 1:28:09.464
What ties?

1:28:10.382 --> 1:28:12.551
What are you talking about,
you wicked girl?

1:28:13.510 --> 1:28:15.345
Holy Mother, I beg you...

1:28:16.012 --> 1:28:18.348
fasten those ties,

1:28:18.390 --> 1:28:21.726
and then tell me what you want to say.

1:29:06.313 --> 1:29:08.481
Yes, you wicked girl,

1:29:08.565 --> 1:29:11.109
this is what I have to say to you.

1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:16.948
Look up, sisters,
because this is meant for everyone.

1:29:19.284 --> 1:29:23.038
In a corner of your souls
you are all wicked women.

1:29:24.289 --> 1:29:26.291
Many of you know that...

1:29:32.172 --> 1:29:33.757
and keep it hidden.

1:29:36.134 --> 1:29:39.262
I don’t. I don’t hide it.

1:29:39.804 --> 1:29:43.892
I am a wicked woman,
because that’s how the Lord made us.

1:29:45.977 --> 1:29:47.646
Spirit...

1:29:52.150 --> 1:29:53.902
and Flesh.

1:29:53.985 --> 1:29:56.196
Faith and Sin.

1:29:56.988 --> 1:30:00.033
And we should glorify
the Almighty for that too,

1:30:00.116 --> 1:30:05.205
who wants his children free
to know the Beatitudes of the Faith

1:30:05.288 --> 1:30:07.666
and the tribulations of the Flesh.

1:30:07.707 --> 1:30:10.669
It’s impossible to give these things up

1:30:10.752 --> 1:30:14.005
because with this clay he molded us.

1:30:16.716 --> 1:30:18.343
Isabetta...

1:30:19.511 --> 1:30:21.388
this is your key.

1:30:21.471 --> 1:30:24.516
Go back to your room where someone awaits,

1:30:24.558 --> 1:30:27.853
and I will return to mine
where someone awaits me.

1:30:29.187 --> 1:30:32.399
I would ask you to put aside
envy and resentment

1:30:33.316 --> 1:30:37.028
and find what we have found
for yourselves.

1:30:39.865 --> 1:30:42.409
Not everyone will find it easy.

1:30:42.492 --> 1:30:45.537
Nature, unfortunately,
did not make us all equal.

1:30:45.579 --> 1:30:47.998
But it’s not impossible.

1:30:48.707 --> 1:30:51.042
Now, quietly...

1:30:51.543 --> 1:30:55.046
try and enjoy yourselves
as much as you can.

1:31:40.425 --> 1:31:42.928
<i>It’s the story of the falcon.</i>

1:31:42.969 --> 1:31:47.599
<i>They told it to me when I was a child,
but I would believe it and laugh and cry.</i>

1:31:49.184 --> 1:31:52.229
<i>I loved that falcon and its young master.</i>

1:31:52.270 --> 1:31:53.813
<i>They were friends.</i>

1:31:55.565 --> 1:31:58.610
Right, I’ll start
with Cavalier Federico Alberighi,

1:31:58.693 --> 1:32:02.822
young, handsome, wealthy
and much esteemed with weapons.

1:32:02.906 --> 1:32:05.534
Yet lovelorn for Monna Giovanna,

1:32:05.617 --> 1:32:08.620
a beautiful, respectable and loving wife.

1:32:09.412 --> 1:32:12.332
For her, he had squandered
on banquets, jousts and gifts

1:32:12.415 --> 1:32:14.417
all his wealth.

1:32:14.459 --> 1:32:17.045
But she didn’t care,
she totally ignored him.

1:32:47.325 --> 1:32:51.204
<i>And Federico became poor,
creditors took all his money.</i>

1:33:33.371 --> 1:33:35.457
You’ll never have my friend!

1:33:58.355 --> 1:34:02.400
<i>He sought solitude
in the only property he had left.</i>

1:34:36.893 --> 1:34:40.105
TWO YEARS LATER

1:35:00.458 --> 1:35:02.669
She’s beautiful, isn’t she?

1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:07.465
- Do you know her?
- Yes.

1:35:08.300 --> 1:35:10.677
She’s been here a year now.

1:35:12.971 --> 1:35:15.682
- She came here for her son’s sake.
- Is he sick?

1:35:16.433 --> 1:35:19.477
It’s strange, it comes and goes.

1:35:20.145 --> 1:35:23.982
But he’s doing well now,
the fresh air will do him good.

1:35:24.065 --> 1:35:25.984
It does everyone good.

1:35:26.026 --> 1:35:29.154
It would have done the master good, too.

1:35:29.654 --> 1:35:31.489
Is he dead?

1:35:32.657 --> 1:35:35.952
Yes, we were all very sad.

1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:48.507
Yes...

1:35:49.341 --> 1:35:50.342
it’s Giovanna.

1:35:50.425 --> 1:35:53.261
Go and say hello to her.

1:36:30.674 --> 1:36:32.467
Here you are!

1:36:48.775 --> 1:36:50.735
He’s my best friend.

1:36:51.236 --> 1:36:53.238
And he’s your friend too now.

1:36:55.949 --> 1:36:58.743
So that means that
you and I are friends too.

1:36:59.369 --> 1:37:02.205
If you promise to bring him every morning

1:37:02.247 --> 1:37:04.499
and teach me to hold him.

1:37:07.169 --> 1:37:08.420
Yes.

1:38:02.807 --> 1:38:04.643
What’s he saying?

1:38:06.353 --> 1:38:08.146
What’s he saying, Bellindia?

1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:10.482
What?

1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:17.280
Bellindia, I don’t understand him.

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:26.039
Rinuccio, what are you trying to say?
What are you saying?

1:38:39.052 --> 1:38:41.555
Mama, look at the falcon up there.

1:38:50.021 --> 1:38:53.859
If you get him for me,
I promise I will get better.

1:39:11.585 --> 1:39:13.086
You’re lovely!

1:39:21.845 --> 1:39:25.557
He’s a hunter too, you know,
like your falcon.

1:39:35.192 --> 1:39:37.944
But I want to hold the falcon.

1:39:38.028 --> 1:39:40.238
And what will we do with this puppy?

1:40:13.647 --> 1:40:15.315
I’m here...

1:40:18.276 --> 1:40:20.028
My son Rinuccio...

1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:23.782
Forgive me, I’d like to sit down.

1:40:29.913 --> 1:40:31.831
It’s hot today, isn’t it?

1:40:34.918 --> 1:40:38.296
I’ve come here, Federico,
how can I put it...

1:40:39.339 --> 1:40:43.593
to compensate you for the damage
your love for me has caused.

1:40:43.635 --> 1:40:47.138
What damage, Giovanna?
It’s been a good thing.

1:40:47.848 --> 1:40:51.601
If I am what I am, I owe it
to the love I feel for you.

1:40:52.686 --> 1:40:56.815
I’ve come here
to eat with you, as a friend.

1:40:56.857 --> 1:40:59.150
Here, in my home?

1:40:59.192 --> 1:41:00.485
Yes.

1:41:01.194 --> 1:41:02.612
Here...

1:41:03.238 --> 1:41:04.739
What’s wrong?

1:41:05.282 --> 1:41:06.867
Nothing.

1:41:06.950 --> 1:41:09.160
You’ve gone as white as a sheet.

1:41:09.786 --> 1:41:13.540
- I live on my own here.
- I knew that.

1:41:13.623 --> 1:41:15.750
I cook my own food.

1:41:15.834 --> 1:41:19.296
Yes, the game you hunt
with your falcon, I knew that too.

1:41:19.337 --> 1:41:22.007
- You’re very good.
- It’s not the hunting season now.

1:41:22.799 --> 1:41:25.760
- I’ll help you.
- No, thank you.

1:41:25.844 --> 1:41:27.762
Wait here, please.

1:41:28.388 --> 1:41:31.141
Or over there, the view’s better.

1:41:32.976 --> 1:41:35.020
I’ll go and prepare something.

1:42:13.892 --> 1:42:15.810
Help me.

1:42:15.894 --> 1:42:17.395
What do I do?

1:42:18.313 --> 1:42:20.398
She’s come to my home

1:42:21.107 --> 1:42:23.235
to ask me
for something simple, and I...

1:42:24.069 --> 1:42:25.946
She won’t come again.

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:29.324
You’ll be surprised, Federico...

1:42:30.158 --> 1:42:32.827
when I tell you my little boy...

1:42:35.247 --> 1:42:36.957
When do I tell him?

1:42:37.040 --> 1:42:39.000
Before or after we’ve eaten?

1:43:39.686 --> 1:43:41.646
Don’t look at me like that.

1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:27.234
This linen’s nice.

1:44:27.901 --> 1:44:30.195
The tablecloth’s nice too.

1:44:32.531 --> 1:44:34.533
What is it, Gubbio linen?

1:44:43.041 --> 1:44:45.293
Why haven’t you eaten anything?

1:44:46.962 --> 1:44:48.880
Aren’t you feeling well?

1:45:00.851 --> 1:45:02.394
Federico...

1:45:04.062 --> 1:45:08.275
you’ll be surprised
when I tell you why I came.

1:45:09.568 --> 1:45:11.570
It’s been nice, of course...

1:45:12.445 --> 1:45:15.866
but I also came to ask you for a gift.

1:45:19.077 --> 1:45:20.662
A gift?

1:45:22.080 --> 1:45:25.250
I am a poor man,
but if it makes you happy...

1:45:27.252 --> 1:45:28.962
What kind of gift?

1:45:32.632 --> 1:45:34.676
Something you love dearly.

1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:40.140
Let’s say it’s your only solace
amidst your misfortune.

1:45:43.101 --> 1:45:45.270
- Your falcon.
- What?

1:45:47.772 --> 1:45:49.774
Your falcon, Federico!

1:45:49.816 --> 1:45:52.861
My son is so obsessed with it,
I’m worried if I don’t take it back,

1:45:52.944 --> 1:45:55.363
his health will deteriorate.

1:46:01.828 --> 1:46:04.456
- The falcon...
- Yes.

1:46:06.875 --> 1:46:09.127
There are no falcons here.

1:46:21.139 --> 1:46:22.807
You don’t want to, eh?

1:46:23.892 --> 1:46:25.852
I see, Federico.

1:46:45.830 --> 1:46:47.791
There’s my falcon.

1:48:48.453 --> 1:48:50.288
Federico degli Alberighi!

1:48:53.583 --> 1:48:55.418
We’re Monna Giovanna’s brothers.

1:48:57.003 --> 1:48:59.256
No, let’s talk here.

1:48:59.297 --> 1:49:02.801
I am Ricciardo, the eldest,
and the first to speak.

1:49:02.884 --> 1:49:05.846
I’ll be honest with you,
we came here reluctantly.

1:49:05.929 --> 1:49:10.058
Since her son died,
Giovanna has not left the house.

1:49:10.141 --> 1:49:12.769
It’s been a year now,
and she must remarry.

1:49:12.811 --> 1:49:16.648
We’ve been back and forth
from Florence with names of suitors,

1:49:16.690 --> 1:49:19.317
the finest in the city, but in vain!

1:49:19.401 --> 1:49:20.902
She’s not interested.

1:49:20.986 --> 1:49:24.656
One day Giovanna called us to her:
“I will marry again”, she said...

1:49:24.698 --> 1:49:27.993
“as you wish, but only one man will do...

1:49:28.076 --> 1:49:29.578
Federico degli Alberighi.”

1:49:29.661 --> 1:49:32.664
“But Federico doesn’t own
a scrap of land, you know that!”

1:49:32.706 --> 1:49:34.332
“I know”, she replied.

1:49:34.416 --> 1:49:40.005
“He is poor, but you, my brothers,
know not the riches of his soul. I do.”

1:49:40.088 --> 1:49:43.008
It’s a woman’s whim.

1:49:43.049 --> 1:49:44.843
You, Federico...

1:49:44.885 --> 1:49:47.637
standing there in silence on your own...

1:49:47.679 --> 1:49:50.056
is it a yes or a no?

1:51:00.877 --> 1:51:04.756
I’ve found the drinking fountain.
The water’s nice and cool!

1:51:18.144 --> 1:51:21.106
Come on, Filostrato!
I’ve found some blackberries!

1:51:24.109 --> 1:51:25.819
Here’s the basket.

1:53:01.706 --> 1:53:04.042
What are you doing?
We’ll do that later.

1:53:05.001 --> 1:53:06.920
Dioneo’s about to begin.

1:53:11.049 --> 1:53:13.134
Neifile, you sit down too.

1:53:14.261 --> 1:53:19.015
Don’t be surprised,
but I’m not going to tell you my story.

1:53:19.891 --> 1:53:22.477
I’ve had something else
on my mind all day.

1:53:24.563 --> 1:53:28.567
I don’t know if you’ve counted,
but we’ve been here 15 days.

1:53:29.734 --> 1:53:32.904
Only ten crazy people
could have hoped to forget

1:53:32.946 --> 1:53:35.240
and rediscover the joys of life.

1:53:36.283 --> 1:53:38.285
And perhaps we have succeeded.

1:53:38.952 --> 1:53:41.204
With our rules...

1:53:41.246 --> 1:53:44.249
I think the chastity rule was too much.

1:53:45.876 --> 1:53:47.794
But now...

1:53:54.634 --> 1:53:56.678
I want to ask you something.

1:53:59.055 --> 1:54:02.934
Do we have the courage to admit
that 15 nights is a long time...

1:54:04.811 --> 1:54:08.690
and that the fine weather
cannot last much longer?

1:54:11.610 --> 1:54:16.489
And we may grow tired of each other?

1:54:16.573 --> 1:54:17.991
No!

1:54:18.074 --> 1:54:22.746
It’s just that it’s only right
we go back where we came from.

1:54:22.787 --> 1:54:26.625
No one knows what we’ll find there.
Not even you, Dioneo!

1:54:27.334 --> 1:54:29.586
Who knows!

1:54:34.591 --> 1:54:35.967
When?

1:54:39.304 --> 1:54:40.472
Tomorrow.

1:54:42.224 --> 1:54:43.725
Tomorrow.

1:54:44.434 --> 1:54:47.312
- All right.
- That’s too soon.

1:54:47.354 --> 1:54:50.315
- Everyone!
- Just a bit longer!

1:55:15.173 --> 1:55:16.883
It’s raining...

1:55:17.384 --> 1:55:20.846
Listen to the raindrops!

1:55:59.259 --> 1:56:02.596
Filostrato, Pampinea, Filomena,
Lauretta, everyone!

1:56:02.679 --> 1:56:04.389
Come over here!

1:56:04.890 --> 1:56:06.725
Let’s say goodbye now, here,

1:56:07.225 --> 1:56:09.561
in this lovely rain!

1:56:09.644 --> 1:56:13.356
Will we meet again?
I hope so.

1:56:13.398 --> 1:56:18.153
And if we do, we’ll remember
our days together in this house.

1:56:19.279 --> 1:56:23.074
Tomorrow feel free to leave when you want.

1:56:23.825 --> 1:56:27.245
I will stay here with some of you
to tidy up the house.
