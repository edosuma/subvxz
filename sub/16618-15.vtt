so good at chess?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.876
I played against my dad.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.944
Uh, was that fun?

11:22.182 --> 11:25.283

the pieces weren't licorice.

Professor.

11:57.684 --> 12:01.052

12:01.054 --> 12:03.722

He's...

12:03.724 --> 12:05.256

Homer, before you give up,

15:18.785 --> 15:22.020
I Skyped someone who knows
a little bit about chess.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.355
Oh, I don't think
any chess master

15:24.357 --> 15:28.593

could understand how I feel.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.403

15:38.405 --> 15:39.938
I'm not a chess player anymore.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.607
From now on,
I'm only playing Stratego!

15:42.609 --> 15:45.076
I cannot play Stratego--
I'm scared of the bomb.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.811
Yeah, tell me about it.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.113
Homer, I'm afraid
you cannot run away from chess.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.982
The reason I got into chess

15:50.984 --> 15:52.951
was because
it<i> didn't</i> involve running.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.720

for exercise.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.956

15:57.958 --> 16:00.224
a Norwegian can muster.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.129
To find your true feelings,

16:05.131 --> 16:07.966
you must finish your final
chess match with your father.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.168

you cut out for a second.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.269
