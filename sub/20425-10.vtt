Previously on "Famous In Love.."

00:01.693 --> 00:03.444
Sometimes people you had in your life

00:03.445 --> 00:05.655
before you became famous
just don't fit anymore.

00:05.656 --> 00:06.823
I'm not famous, Rainer.

00:06.824 --> 00:08.908
You're moving on to this new world

00:08.909 --> 00:10.785
and Jake and I are not a part of it.

00:10.786 --> 00:11.994
Why would you attach yourself

00:11.995 --> 00:13.830
to a script you haven't read, Paige?

00:13.831 --> 00:15.641
I'm trying to help.

00:17.668 --> 00:21.212
I've stopped sleeping with
Nina. It's over. I promise.

00:21.213 --> 00:23.923
I mean, you never gave
us a chance as a couple.

00:25.634 --> 00:28.862
Do yourself a favor and
stay the hell away from me.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.889
- He's my father.
- Yes.

00:31.890 --> 00:35.035
You lied to me every day for 23 years.

00:36.395 --> 00:37.979
Oh, my God, Rainer.

00:37.980 --> 00:40.022
What is.. Have you been drinking?

00:40.023 --> 00:41.333
Are you drunk, Rainer?

00:42.568 --> 00:43.568
'Rainer!'

00:43.569 --> 00:46.004
All of you! You parasites!

00:49.533 --> 00:51.742
- Rainer, are you off the wagon?
- Let me go!

00:51.743 --> 00:54.036
- You let me go!
- Oh, come on!

00:54.037 --> 00:55.329
- Back up!
- Alright, alright.

00:55.330 --> 00:56.873
- 'Back up!'
- 'Are you drunk, Rainer?'

00:56.874 --> 00:58.134
- Back up!
- Alright, alright!

00:58.752 --> 01:00.335
'Get in the car! Get in the car!'

01:00.336 --> 01:02.003
- Get in! Come on!
- 'I'm not going!'

01:02.004 --> 01:04.046
'We're going. We're leaving without..'

01:04.047 --> 01:05.298
That club..

01:05.299 --> 01:07.216
Get in here! Drive, drive, drive!

01:07.217 --> 01:08.277
Let's go! Let's go!

01:14.850 --> 01:16.570
I can't believe I just
left my own premiere.

01:16.571 --> 01:18.914
Do you want me to call you
another driver to take you back?

01:18.915 --> 01:20.605
No, uh.. It's okay. It's okay.

01:20.606 --> 01:22.686
- Let's just go home.
- Okay. We're headed to Malibu.

01:22.687 --> 01:24.438
No, no. Let's go, let's go to a bar.

01:24.439 --> 01:26.027
No, you're going home.

01:26.028 --> 01:29.030
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

01:29.031 --> 01:31.032
W-wait, you think that you can just

01:31.033 --> 01:34.035
tell me what to do now
because you're my father?

01:34.036 --> 01:37.038
Yeah. Alan Mills is my dad.

01:37.039 --> 01:38.831
What? What is he talking about?

01:38.832 --> 01:42.877
This man right here
is my father. My pops.

01:42.878 --> 01:46.088
D-A-D-D-Y. Dad.

01:46.089 --> 01:47.506
No, really. Come on.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.926
Yeah, it's..

01:49.927 --> 01:51.844
- Wow.
- I know.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.388
It's gonna take a while
to get used to that, right?

01:54.389 --> 01:57.659
But hey, you know,
whatever. He's my father.

01:59.102 --> 02:01.979
How is it gonna work now?

02:01.980 --> 02:05.083
Alan, I mean, we couldn't..

02:07.653 --> 02:10.404
Why weren't you around?

02:10.405 --> 02:12.198
Why didn't you tell me?

02:12.199 --> 02:15.761
Rainer, I didn't even know
until about a week ago.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.457
That lying bitch kept
it from both of us...

02:21.458 --> 02:23.793
No, no, no, you do not
call your mother that!

02:23.794 --> 02:26.075
- Why not? Why the hell not?
- Because it's disrespectful!

02:26.076 --> 02:27.660
I don't care how famous you are!

02:27.661 --> 02:30.466
- That's disrespectful!
- What are you talking about?

02:30.467 --> 02:32.802
She lied to me my entire life.

02:32.803 --> 02:35.221
- Famous. Famous!
- I-I understand that.

02:35.222 --> 02:38.307
I think I'm entitled to my anger, Alan!

02:38.308 --> 02:40.977
And if I feel like going
out instead of going home

02:40.978 --> 02:43.604
then I'm gonna do that
because I'm an adult

02:43.605 --> 02:46.833
and I don't have to listen
to a father that I never had!

02:49.111 --> 02:52.154
Listen, can you handle
your friend tonight?

02:52.155 --> 02:53.489
- 'Hey!'
- 'Rainer!'

02:53.490 --> 02:55.741
Oh, my, God. Stop!

02:55.742 --> 02:56.909
Rainer!

02:56.910 --> 02:58.911
Rainer Devon? Do you need a ride?

02:58.912 --> 03:01.289
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Rainer. Rainer.

03:01.290 --> 03:03.124
Don't do it. No, no,
no, no. Rainer. Rainer.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.209
Bye-bye!

03:05.210 --> 03:06.228
'Whoo!'

No one but me, that is.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.143
And tune into my
"Inside The Town" special

03:22.144 --> 03:26.498
where I'll out all of Nina Devon
and Jordan Wilder's secrets.

03:29.359 --> 03:32.194
- Cass, where...
- I'm so sorry.

03:32.195 --> 03:34.238
Are you okay?

03:34.239 --> 03:37.366
Yeah. So y-you saw it?

03:37.367 --> 03:39.618
I was at Adam's and
we couldn't believe it.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.412
- What happened?
- I-I don't know.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.331
Alan and Jordan dragged
him out of there.

03:43.332 --> 03:44.795
I mean, I've been trying to call him

03:44.796 --> 03:46.582
but o-of course, he's
not answering my calls.

03:46.583 --> 03:49.253
They probably took him home
and he's sleeping it off.

03:49.254 --> 03:51.022
Well, I hope so.

03:54.009 --> 03:56.427
Thanks for coming back, Cass.

03:56.428 --> 03:58.405
Where else would I be?

04:03.852 --> 04:05.603
Now why were you hiding it from me?

04:05.604 --> 04:07.521
- I wasn't hiding it.
- 'You jumped on Rory'

04:07.522 --> 04:09.505
'when you thought she told
me you were hiding it.'

04:09.506 --> 04:11.317
'She did not jump on me, Grandma.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.194
Hey, you're not even watching.

04:13.195 --> 04:15.654
Sorry, I'm just, I'm a
little worried about..

04:16.697 --> 04:18.991
Rainer. Oh, my God.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.510
Rainer's calling me right now.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.933
Hi, Rainer, h-how are you?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.145
Never been better.

04:31.588 --> 04:34.465
I was thinking of you, actually.

04:34.466 --> 04:36.842
- Oh, you have?
- 'Mm-hmm.'

04:36.843 --> 04:40.304
I'm, uh, I'm at a bar
on your campus, CMU.

04:40.305 --> 04:42.515
That's your school, isn't it?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.475
'Um, yeah, that-that,
that is my school.'

04:44.476 --> 04:46.310
Wait, w-what bar are you at?

04:46.311 --> 04:48.270
He's at CMU.

04:48.271 --> 04:51.399
I have no idea.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.985
But the beer is cold
and the people are warm.

04:54.986 --> 04:57.863
Hey, Rain, can you by any
chance describe the bar to me?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.527
I've probably been
there a thousand times.

04:59.528 --> 05:01.617
I live so close to CMU.

05:01.618 --> 05:03.244
'I can always meet you there.'

05:03.245 --> 05:05.705
Hey, hey, what's the name of..

05:05.706 --> 05:06.973
Wait a minute.

05:07.999 --> 05:10.334
Did my mother put you up to this?

05:10.335 --> 05:12.128
Uh, no, Rain.

05:12.129 --> 05:15.339
- You called me, remember?
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

05:15.340 --> 05:19.319
I'm calling you back because you care.

05:21.012 --> 05:23.264
Do you care, Paige?

05:23.265 --> 05:26.809
Like, like really care?

05:26.810 --> 05:29.746
Yeah, Rainer. I-I do care.

05:31.314 --> 05:35.192
And if you can just tell me
where you are, we can talk about

05:35.193 --> 05:38.380
you know, the, the stuff
you're going through.

05:39.322 --> 05:40.841
'Last call, folks!'

05:42.200 --> 05:44.785
Another round for my friends..

05:44.786 --> 05:47.413
...which is everybody in this bar!

05:50.500 --> 05:52.168
Up top! Up top!

05:52.169 --> 05:54.503
You! You! Shots! Come on, more shots!

05:56.465 --> 05:58.424
- Uh, hello?
- 'Up top! Up top!'

05:58.425 --> 06:00.843
Uh, hello? Rainer?

06:00.844 --> 06:02.553
Oh, my God, he blew my eardrum.

06:02.554 --> 06:05.347
- He's screaming.
- Okay, he is at of bar at CMU.

06:05.348 --> 06:07.433
But, I mean, t-there's
like dozens of parties.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.894
We can't just go from
bar to bar to bar. What..

06:09.895 --> 06:12.188
Well, okay, he's a
famous celebrity, Paige.

06:12.189 --> 06:14.315
Hashtag WhereisRainerDevon is a thing!

06:14.316 --> 06:16.358
- Okay.
- He is at Shots.

06:16.359 --> 06:17.822
- Bar on Hennessey.
- Okay, let's go.

06:17.823 --> 06:19.466
Let's go. Come on.

06:25.035 --> 06:27.369
What?

06:27.370 --> 06:29.413
They're just closing.

06:29.414 --> 06:30.956
He is not here.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.375
- 'Sorry. We're closed.'
- Great.

06:33.376 --> 06:37.379
Okay, well, um, let's
check the hashtag again.

06:37.380 --> 06:40.341
See if..

06:40.342 --> 06:42.360
God, we lost him.

06:55.591 --> 06:58.259
Hey. Is Rainer here?

06:58.260 --> 07:01.971
- No.
- Has anybody heard from him?

07:01.972 --> 07:03.473
That's the million dollar question.

07:03.474 --> 07:06.935
Hey, uh, Adam, I'm gonna talk
to Jordan for a quick sec.

07:06.936 --> 07:08.978
Sure. I'll give you five minutes.

07:08.979 --> 07:11.522
And then Arthur will have
my head if you're not on set.

07:11.523 --> 07:12.708
Thanks.

07:14.526 --> 07:18.947
Hey, Jordan, um, did
Rainer come home last night?

07:18.948 --> 07:20.990
Nope.

07:20.991 --> 07:23.076
I don't understand,
what-what happened to him?

07:23.077 --> 07:25.387
Why did he start drinking again?

07:27.456 --> 07:30.667
Look, Jordan, I know

07:30.668 --> 07:33.294
we haven't really had the
chance to get to know each other

07:33.295 --> 07:38.007
but I've spent a lot of
time with Rainer lately

07:38.008 --> 07:40.593
and I'm worried about him.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.738
So can you just tell me what happened?

07:46.976 --> 07:48.285
Um..

07:50.145 --> 07:53.690
He found out that his
mother has been lying to him

07:53.691 --> 07:55.417
about who his father is.

07:56.819 --> 08:00.363
His real father is alive
and he knows the guy.

08:00.364 --> 08:04.409
- I-I really shouldn't...
- No, right, right. O-of course.

08:04.410 --> 08:09.080
Uh, yeah, that, that explains it.

08:09.081 --> 08:10.744
'Cast and crew on stage, please.'

08:10.745 --> 08:12.389
Come on, we should go.

08:13.252 --> 08:15.044
We wanna make sure that
that's a possibility.

08:15.045 --> 08:16.713
- Okay.
- So don't..

08:16.714 --> 08:18.257
- Uh, hey.
- Did you hear from him yet?

08:18.258 --> 08:20.758
- Last night, yeah.
- Why didn't you call me?

08:20.759 --> 08:22.760
He was already gone by
the time I got there.

08:22.761 --> 08:25.054
- Where?
- A bar on campus.

08:25.055 --> 08:27.807
Okay, next time, call me.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.785
I know. I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:33.063 --> 08:34.856
Alright, we need to salvage this day.

08:34.857 --> 08:36.256
You want me to make an announcement

08:36.258 --> 08:37.201
or are you gonna do it?

08:37.202 --> 08:38.192
- I'll do it.
- Alright.

08:38.193 --> 08:39.861
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm here.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.565
'Okay, guys, let's gather around.'

08:41.566 --> 08:42.447
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:42.448 --> 08:45.408
So, all of you were at Jordan's premiere

08:45.409 --> 08:47.577
last night or you heard about it

08:47.578 --> 08:52.957
so I don't have to tell
you that Rainer's not well.

08:52.958 --> 08:57.754
If anyone knows where he is
or gets in contact with him

08:57.755 --> 08:59.898
please tell me.

09:01.258 --> 09:02.967
So here's the plan for today.

09:02.968 --> 09:06.137
We're gonna move up
scene 33A, 25 and 40.

09:06.138 --> 09:07.847
We're gonna shoot on
the Brooklyn backlot

09:07.848 --> 09:10.016
with Tangey, Xu Yifei and Jordan.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.321
Let me see how fast you guys
can get into hair and makeup.

09:12.322 --> 09:13.770
Jordan, Tangey, you're with me.

09:13.771 --> 09:16.147
Um, hey, so a-am I shooting today?

09:16.148 --> 09:17.648
Uh, stick around for an hour

09:17.649 --> 09:19.567
see if Rainer comes back
and if he's still MIA

09:19.568 --> 09:21.311
we'll shoot your stuff
with Alexis tomorrow.

09:21.312 --> 09:22.454
Okay.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.657
- 'Great shot.'
- 'Keep shooting.'

09:26.658 --> 09:28.051
'Move it.'

09:34.625 --> 09:37.585
- Tange, wait up.
- What, Jordan?

09:37.586 --> 09:40.463
I just need to ask you something.

09:40.464 --> 09:42.131
Please don't tell
Rainer about Nina and I.

09:42.132 --> 09:43.174
Really?

09:43.175 --> 09:44.255
I don't think this would be

09:44.256 --> 09:45.599
a great time for him to find out.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.372
Why would I wanna ruin his
life with your lies too?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.409
But this, this is done.

09:58.690 --> 10:01.460
- Hey, how are you holdin' up?
- Well, not well.

10:03.278 --> 10:04.821
I know about Alan, Nina.

10:04.822 --> 10:06.465
Well, pretty soon the
whole world's gonna know.

10:06.466 --> 10:08.786
Barrett Hopper's been taunting
me through his Twitter feed.

10:08.810 --> 10:09.659
What did he say?

10:09.660 --> 10:10.868
He called this morning asking

10:10.869 --> 10:14.080
for a exclusive update on Rainer.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.504
When I told him to go screw himself

10:15.505 --> 10:18.000
he, he admitted that he's going wide

10:18.001 --> 10:20.187
with the story about
Alan being his father.

10:22.381 --> 10:23.815
And about us.

10:25.634 --> 10:28.761
Wait, wait, h-how would he,
how would he know about us?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.054
I-I don't know.

10:30.055 --> 10:31.895
If Rainer finds out that
I've been lying to him

10:31.896 --> 10:33.731
all these years, first
Tangey and then you

10:33.732 --> 10:36.144
he's never going to forgive me, never!

10:36.145 --> 10:38.479
If Barrett Hopper outed
all these things in my past

10:38.480 --> 10:41.023
forget about the Golden Globes

10:41.024 --> 10:42.483
I'm gonna be looking for a lawyer

10:42.484 --> 10:44.694
to keep me out of jail.

10:44.695 --> 10:47.214
- Jordan, don't.
- I gotta get to wardrobe.

10:55.164 --> 10:57.665
- Hey, Paige!
- Paige! Paige! Over here!

10:57.666 --> 11:00.710
- Is he staying with you?
- Exactly what time..

11:15.350 --> 11:16.743
Cassie?

11:20.230 --> 11:21.415
Oh.

11:22.941 --> 11:25.168
Hi, umm..

11:28.238 --> 11:29.655
I-I thought you were working.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.325
What, so you figured you'd just pack up

11:32.326 --> 11:35.286
and leave before I even got home?

11:35.287 --> 11:37.205
Well, um..

11:37.206 --> 11:39.207
Wow. You-you were gonna do that.

11:39.208 --> 11:41.292
No, no, no, no. Paige,
come on, I'm sorry.

11:41.293 --> 11:44.187
It's fine, Jake. Please, please,
just pretend I'm not even here.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.619
Paige, come on.

12:00.354 --> 12:01.705
Open up, I wanna talk.

12:04.149 --> 12:07.443
I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

12:07.444 --> 12:09.612
'I'm going to Austin.'

12:09.613 --> 12:11.864
It's something I felt I needed to do.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.824
'I'll be gone for three months.'

12:13.825 --> 12:16.470
Okay, that's it a-and then
I'll probably come back.

12:21.250 --> 12:24.085
Just for three months?

12:24.086 --> 12:27.213
Well, what if you fall in love?

12:27.214 --> 12:29.549
With Austin, you know?

12:29.550 --> 12:31.860
Everybody just loves it there.

12:33.178 --> 12:36.156
And then probably never come back home.

12:40.644 --> 12:42.579
Is that a new hairstyle or something?

12:44.189 --> 12:48.251
Um, only when I travel back in time.

12:49.444 --> 12:52.321
- Huh?
- For the movie.

12:52.322 --> 12:55.157
I tra.. I travel back
in time for the movie.

12:55.158 --> 12:58.244
I usually, um, brush it out

12:58.245 --> 13:01.723
but I just, I really
had to get out of there.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.711
Did Rainer not show up?

13:06.712 --> 13:08.212
I-I mean, I saw it in the airport.

13:08.213 --> 13:13.634
Oh, no. Um, no, uh, production
might even shut down now.

13:13.635 --> 13:15.654
Everybody's still looking for him.

13:16.722 --> 13:19.890
Hey, can we talk about
this, me moving out?

13:19.891 --> 13:24.228
Yes. What do I have to do
to convince you to stay?

13:24.229 --> 13:25.414
I, uh..

13:28.066 --> 13:29.650
- I...
- Hey, you're back.

13:29.651 --> 13:31.027
Hey, Cass.

13:31.028 --> 13:33.821
Uh, thanks, but I, I
don't need any more boxes.

13:33.822 --> 13:37.241
- Oh, this is for me, actually.
- Why?

13:37.242 --> 13:38.784
'Cause I'm moving in with Adam.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.286
Wait, you're still moving out?

13:40.287 --> 13:41.996
Well, Cassie, you sure
that's a good idea?

13:41.997 --> 13:43.247
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know.

13:43.248 --> 13:44.290
I mean, I have a good reason.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.634
You know, I'm doing it for a job.

13:45.635 --> 13:47.168
Didn't you and Adam just start dating?

13:47.169 --> 13:48.711
Okay, Judgy McJudgerson.

13:48.712 --> 13:51.213
'No, I'm just saying that
we're both leaving Paige.'

13:51.214 --> 13:52.590
So, you get to decide what I do?

13:52.591 --> 13:54.925
Look, I can take care of myself, guys.

13:54.926 --> 13:57.636
For the record, I don't
want anybody to move out.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.221
But whatever, I guess it doesn't matter

13:59.222 --> 14:02.242
considering nobody ever really
asked me of what I wanted.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.229
So when are you leaving? Tonight?

14:07.230 --> 14:08.707
No, I'll take off tomorrow.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.711
- Hi, Alexis.
- Hi.

14:30.712 --> 14:32.630
What a surprise.

14:32.631 --> 14:34.900
Didn't know you were
gonna be at this meeting.

14:36.301 --> 14:39.345
I hate to jump right in but
we have another appointment

14:39.346 --> 14:41.389
in half an hour, so..

14:41.390 --> 14:43.307
Okay, sure.

14:43.308 --> 14:46.644
So I read Kevin's new draft

14:46.645 --> 14:48.979
and, uh, I have to be honest

14:48.980 --> 14:51.440
the third act fell completely...

14:51.441 --> 14:52.384
Alexis...

14:52.385 --> 14:55.236
We didn't come here
to go over your notes.

14:55.237 --> 14:58.138
We're feeling like you're
resisting Kevin's changes.

14:58.139 --> 14:59.848
Like your heart's not in it.

14:59.849 --> 15:02.184
Since when do you care
where my heart is, Rachel?

15:02.185 --> 15:04.120
Since I was made a producer.

15:05.897 --> 15:09.608
Okay, um, that feels like

15:09.609 --> 15:11.193
one producer too many, but whatever.

15:11.194 --> 15:14.321
It is. Which is why
we're letting you go.

15:14.322 --> 15:15.548
What?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.747
Are you kidding me with this?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.916
Thank you for all of your hard work.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.019
We've compensated you for your time.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.798
Kevin wrote out your
part, so we no longer

15:32.799 --> 15:35.926
need your services for anything.

15:35.927 --> 15:38.863
I knew you were a snake
from the moment I met you.

15:40.056 --> 15:41.640
But you.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.851
God, you've been in Hollywood one minute

15:43.852 --> 15:45.536
and you're already a heartless bitch.

15:57.181 --> 15:58.781
Even after everything we've been through

15:58.782 --> 16:01.034
I still thought you'd be loyal to me.

16:01.035 --> 16:03.704
I cared about you.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.223
Maybe I even loved you.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.793
Just 'cause I wasn't ready
to shout our relationship

16:09.794 --> 16:12.563
from the rooftops, you
wanna punish me forever?

16:28.904 --> 16:30.572
'Camera and action!'

16:30.573 --> 16:34.158
I just, I don't know if Noah
feels the same way about me.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.451
Well, how could he not?

16:35.452 --> 16:38.997
You're beautiful and smart and nice.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.874
How could I be having
these feelings? I'm with Ed.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.502
Yeah. I guess it is kind of a betrayal.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.380
God, you're right.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.340
How could I even betray Jake like that?

16:49.341 --> 16:52.427
Cut! Paige, please look at your lines!

16:52.428 --> 16:55.305
- Back to one, everybody!
- What-what-what did I say?

16:55.306 --> 16:57.515
You said Jake, dumb-ass.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.162
Why are you such a horrible human being?

17:05.482 --> 17:08.026
So did Jake leave for Austin yet?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.528
No, he's packing as we speak.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.195
Kind of a huge step backwards

17:12.196 --> 17:14.574
to work as a PA after selling a script.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.535
- And who's fault is that?
- Okay, you know what, stop.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.744
I'm trying to be nice to you

17:18.746 --> 17:21.580
you backwards country
freak, but why bother?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.124
If Rainer doesn't get his act together

17:23.125 --> 17:25.627
this whole thing is gonna shut down.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.087
And you can say goodbye
to your acting career

17:28.088 --> 17:29.615
'cause no one's gonna cast some nobody

17:29.616 --> 17:31.496
that they've never heard
of 'cause you were just

17:31.497 --> 17:33.331
a publicity stunt for Gold Brothers.

17:33.332 --> 17:36.095
Alexis, I'm not going anywhere.

17:36.096 --> 17:38.890
Yeah. Yeah, matter of
fact, I'm here to stay.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.852
Now, if I were you, I'd be
a little bit more worried

17:42.853 --> 17:44.771
about getting Rainer back on this movie

17:44.772 --> 17:49.275
because where do you go after
being sixth on the call sheet

17:49.276 --> 17:51.736
playing a nobody's dumb-ass sister?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.446
'Take your places.'

17:53.447 --> 17:55.073
Quiet on set, please.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.614
I'm sorry. Can you give me a minute?

17:58.786 --> 18:01.663
I'm sorry, Alexis. I
should not have said that.

18:01.664 --> 18:05.500
I'm just frustrated.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.961
Look, you've known
Rainer the longest, okay.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.464
Well, where would he go if-if
he was upset about something?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.567
Where-where would he be right now?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.804
Before he got sober,
he used to hit baseballs

18:17.805 --> 18:19.931
at this park in Beverly Hills.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.612
- What park?
- 'Okay, guys, that's enough.'

18:21.613 --> 18:23.072
'We gotta go. We gotta go!'

18:23.073 --> 18:24.769
'Roll sound'

18:24.770 --> 18:26.455
'and camera, action!'

18:27.606 --> 18:30.650
Oh, Maggie, thanks for
always being there for me.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.128
Of course. You just gotta talk it out.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.489
Dimitri, we're not shutting
down production at all.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.134
Like, there's nothing to panic about.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.619
Alright. We'll talk later.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.805
Proshchay.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.875
- Have you heard from Rainer?
- No, I have not.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.877
But I've actually got two really good

18:49.878 --> 18:52.213
private investigators
working around the clock.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.297
How did you find them?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.674
My ex-wife used them

18:54.675 --> 18:56.134
to catch me when I was cheating.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.344
Trust me, they're good.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.638
But I'm also here to
talk about our other baby.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.765
"Locked." How bad is it?

19:02.766 --> 19:04.909
Wyatt says we've got half
a day at best without Rainer

19:04.910 --> 19:08.021
before they're going
to have to shut down.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.398
We've also got a press junket tonight

19:10.399 --> 19:12.817
with the cast that I'm
going have to cancel

19:12.818 --> 19:15.081
and then everyone will know
that the movie's in jeopardy.

19:15.082 --> 19:16.404
And then Barrett Hopper's report

19:16.405 --> 19:19.550
is gonna hit the airwaves
tomorrow revealing..

19:21.368 --> 19:22.928
What?

19:29.168 --> 19:32.628
That I had an affair with Jordan Wilder.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.881
Rainer doesn't know yet,
but when he finds out

19:34.882 --> 19:38.259
that... will be it for us.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.094
There's no going back from that.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.180
I wish someone would
squash Barrett Hopper

19:42.181 --> 19:44.491
like the little cockroach that he is.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.478
Aren't you gonna tell me
what a horrible person I am?

19:48.479 --> 19:51.981
Nina, you're like a
female version of me.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.483
That's why we fought so much.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.860
That's why we, we didn't make it

19:55.861 --> 20:00.198
because we remind each
other too much of ourselves.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.784
Well, that may be the nicest
thing anyone ever said to me.

20:05.662 --> 20:09.641
So do you want me to cancel
that, uh, press junket?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.145
No, don't.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.756
If we can get Rainer there

20:16.757 --> 20:19.759
maybe this is the way to
calm down our investors

20:19.760 --> 20:21.511
and get this movie back on track.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.779
Attagirl.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.911
Eva, get me Wilder on phone right away.

20:39.154 --> 20:40.547
'Hey.'

20:46.703 --> 20:48.830
How did you find me, Paige?

20:48.831 --> 20:52.517
A little birdie named Alexis
told me you used to play here.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.963
Is everyone worried about me

20:56.964 --> 20:59.983
or their own jobs if the film goes down?

21:05.305 --> 21:06.722
I care about you, Rain

21:06.723 --> 21:09.142
and that's why I'm really worried.

21:09.143 --> 21:13.121
Do you wanna just put that
down, so we can... talk?

21:15.732 --> 21:18.234
Remember that time you told me

21:18.235 --> 21:20.695
how much you hated yourself
when you were drinking

21:20.696 --> 21:22.947
and how that car
accident made you realize

21:22.948 --> 21:25.366
you could've lost everything?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.869
There's Uber now, Paige.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.912
I can go back to drinking
as much as I want.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.831
Come on, Rain, don't
dismiss me like that.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.125
You can get a hold of
this. I know you can.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.503
And I'm here. I'm right here for you.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.423
You're only helping, so
I'll go back to the movie

21:40.424 --> 21:42.985
and you can be a star.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.073
I was so attracted to how pure you were.

21:49.433 --> 21:54.395
How unmotivated by fame, prestige.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.915
I'm still that person, Rainer.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.752
I don't know.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.676
Rainer.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.744
'Hey!'

22:09.745 --> 22:11.722
Rainer!

22:12.956 --> 22:16.143
Look, I-I thought we meant
something to each other.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.545
Right?

22:19.546 --> 22:22.441
That you and me, we
could count on each other?

22:23.967 --> 22:26.069
Well, you thought wrong.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.783
Okay.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.964
Oh, Rain. I was worried about you, man.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.383
We were all worried about you.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.570
- You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks, man.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.697
I think so.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.395
I'm sorry I ruined your premiere.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.772
Oh, man, don't sweat
it. It's not a big deal.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.525
Yes, it was. Yes, it was,
it was your big moment.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.086
It's forgotten.

23:25.153 --> 23:28.673
I get it. You've had a
lot to deal with lately.

23:29.992 --> 23:34.096
Well, don't worry. I'm
gonna get it together.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.017
I know you will.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.937
And I'm here if you need me.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.527
Thanks for always having my back.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.932
You're a true friend.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.892
You always have been.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.395
I'm going to bed.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.997
I'm exhausted.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.794
- Hello?
- It's Jordan Wilder.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.547
- I have a deal for you.
- 'Too late, Jordan.'

24:26.548 --> 24:29.050
I'm just about finished
editing my special.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.926
It's airing tomorrow night.

24:30.927 --> 24:33.387
I'm outing Rainer Devon's reasons

24:33.388 --> 24:34.388
for falling off the wagon

24:34.389 --> 24:37.016
leading with your affair with Nina.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.268
I'd like to come clean
about who I am on your show.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.104
I'll tell everything.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.774
About my mom, about my past

24:44.775 --> 24:46.942
'all on "Inside The Town."'

24:46.943 --> 24:48.486
There's just one thing.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.404
You're not to reveal
the affair with Nina.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.655
What's in it for me?

24:51.656 --> 24:53.337
I already know everything
you have to tell.

24:53.338 --> 24:54.714
'But it will be coming from me.'

24:54.715 --> 24:56.235
And you don't know it all.

24:56.236 --> 24:58.154
Look, I'll confess to murdering

24:58.155 --> 25:00.156
my mom's boyfriend on your show.

25:00.157 --> 25:02.009
'You'll get an exclusive.'

25:03.744 --> 25:06.680
Sounds good. Let's see
what you have to say.

25:16.969 --> 25:19.512
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:19.513 --> 25:21.681
Thank you for bringing my check.

25:21.682 --> 25:24.726
You were right. I do need the money.

25:24.727 --> 25:26.245
- Bye.
- Wait.

25:27.438 --> 25:30.315
Lex, I'm sorry. Okay?

25:30.316 --> 25:33.026
I feel really bad about how
that meeting ended earlier.

25:33.027 --> 25:36.196
Just about the meeting? Not
how I was unfairly fired?

25:36.197 --> 25:37.447
I'm sorry, okay, but it's just

25:37.448 --> 25:40.158
it's just one project, Lex.
You'll find a better one.

25:40.159 --> 25:42.199
You don't even like Kevin
O'Hare's writing anyway...

25:42.223 --> 25:43.809
Okay, stop, the last thing I need

25:43.810 --> 25:45.131
from you right now is a pep talk.

25:45.132 --> 25:46.692
Well, you were right when you called me

25:46.716 --> 25:49.225
a heartless bitch.

25:50.225 --> 25:52.810
I'm listening.

25:52.811 --> 25:54.830
I'm becoming one.

25:57.149 --> 26:00.067
Look, I don't wanna be that
type of person who lashes out

26:00.068 --> 26:01.694
whenever she doesn't get what she wants.

26:01.695 --> 26:02.987
So don't.

26:02.988 --> 26:04.089
Look..

26:05.240 --> 26:06.866
What you said earlier at lunch

26:06.867 --> 26:10.286
about caring about me

26:10.287 --> 26:14.832
about loving me, were
you telling the truth?

26:14.833 --> 26:17.728
Have you not been
listening to me at all?

26:19.588 --> 26:22.673
I still have feelings for you, Rachel.

26:22.674 --> 26:24.383
Why is that so hard for you to believe?

26:29.431 --> 26:32.391
You know, I'm really sick

26:32.392 --> 26:33.976
of not living the life that I want.

27:19.690 --> 27:21.440
We have it handled.

27:21.441 --> 27:24.235
Of course. I-I have to go.

27:24.236 --> 27:25.629
Thank you.

27:26.780 --> 27:29.490
- Rain.
- Don't.

27:29.491 --> 27:30.908
Just don't.

27:30.909 --> 27:33.077
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for the movie.

27:33.078 --> 27:35.162
I'm ready to go back to work.

27:35.163 --> 27:37.331
I think we should get you into a program

27:37.332 --> 27:39.333
or in to see a counselor or something...

27:39.334 --> 27:43.254
I'm an adult. I'll
seek help if I need it.

27:43.255 --> 27:44.630
I can start work tomorrow.

27:44.631 --> 27:48.134
Well, if we're gonna talk about business

27:48.135 --> 27:51.762
there is some damage control
we need to do on the movie.

27:51.763 --> 27:54.140
'I've set a press junket for tonight.'

27:54.141 --> 27:56.392
Fine, I'll do it.

27:56.393 --> 28:00.104
Right. Well, they're gonna
ask you what happened.

28:00.105 --> 28:02.315
I'll tell them I'm getting help.

28:02.316 --> 28:03.733
The rest is none of their business.

28:03.734 --> 28:05.517
You don't have to say
that you were drinking.

28:05.518 --> 28:08.279
You could say that
you had some down work

28:08.280 --> 28:11.532
and you took medication that
you had a terrible reaction to.

28:11.533 --> 28:14.285
You just can't help yourself, can you?

28:14.286 --> 28:18.390
I'm taking responsibility. Okay, Nina.

28:25.422 --> 28:26.773
Have a good day.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.176
'Ooh, what is that?'

28:30.177 --> 28:33.137
- You like it?
- So pretty.

28:33.138 --> 28:36.307
It's for, uh, the press
junket tonight at Four Seasons.

28:36.308 --> 28:37.683
Rainer's back.

28:37.684 --> 28:39.536
Well, I'm glad to know he's okay.

28:41.438 --> 28:44.374
Well... car is all packed up.

28:46.693 --> 28:48.110
I better get on the road.

28:48.111 --> 28:50.046
I can't believe this is really it.

28:51.615 --> 28:53.199
Please call me when you get there.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.468
Yeah.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.411
It'll probably be tomorrow night though.

28:57.412 --> 28:59.347
Got a long drive ahead of me.

29:08.048 --> 29:09.316
Bye, Paige.

29:18.558 --> 29:20.160
Three amigos.

29:28.235 --> 29:30.528
Why do we have to do goodbye here?

29:30.529 --> 29:32.488
Why can't we just walk
you down to the car?

29:32.489 --> 29:34.824
And be tomorrow's new story?

29:34.825 --> 29:37.159
There is way too many
paparazzi out there.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.411
It's not worth it.

29:38.412 --> 29:40.454
Okay.

29:40.455 --> 29:42.807
I'll, uh, call you when I get there.

29:44.334 --> 29:45.894
Bye.

30:13.488 --> 30:14.697
I can't, I can't.

30:16.032 --> 30:18.325
- Jake! Jake!
- 'Is he also a drinker?'

30:18.326 --> 30:20.119
Where you going, Paige?
Where are you going?

30:20.120 --> 30:23.539
- Are you mad about the movies?'
- Is that your new boyfriend?'

30:23.540 --> 30:25.416
Paige, are you trying
to get with him too?

30:25.417 --> 30:27.334
Excuse me.

30:27.335 --> 30:28.998
- Where are you going, Paige?
- Excuse me!

30:28.999 --> 30:30.588
- Where are you goin'?
- 'Who's Jake?'

30:30.589 --> 30:33.191
- Jake! Hey!
- Where are you going?

30:34.342 --> 30:35.342
Jake!

30:35.343 --> 30:38.387
Hey! Jake!

30:38.388 --> 30:39.531
Jake!

30:46.021 --> 30:47.372
'Hey, you okay?'

30:49.941 --> 30:51.358
No, it's absolutely ridiculous.

30:51.359 --> 30:53.986
The hair and makeup department
is completely overbudget.

30:53.987 --> 30:56.530
I can cut out $200,000..

30:56.531 --> 30:59.325
So we can..

30:59.326 --> 31:01.744
Excuse me, what do
you think you're doing?

31:01.745 --> 31:03.425
I know what you and
Jordan have been doing.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.009
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:05.010 --> 31:07.144
He told me that you've been
sleeping with him, Nina.

31:07.145 --> 31:10.503
That you two started sleeping
together a long time ago.

31:10.504 --> 31:13.773
Back when you first met.
Before he was even 18.

31:18.845 --> 31:21.805
Well, that's not..

31:21.806 --> 31:25.351
- That can't be true.
- He was 16.

31:25.352 --> 31:28.038
He lied about his age to
get a role on "Backsplash."

31:30.023 --> 31:32.816
What do you want?

31:32.817 --> 31:35.444
I want my part back, Nina. My part.

31:35.445 --> 31:38.489
As in I'm the only time
sorceress in "Locked"

31:38.490 --> 31:43.160
in the US, in China, on Mars.

31:43.161 --> 31:45.120
Now I don't ever want to hear

31:45.121 --> 31:47.998
the name Xu Yifei ever again, okay?

31:47.999 --> 31:49.750
You didn't even want
that part, remember?

31:49.751 --> 31:53.504
- Ida wanted it for you.
- And she was right.

31:53.505 --> 31:54.588
I can do both.

31:54.589 --> 31:56.298
And I want it all, Nina.

31:56.299 --> 31:59.176
Movie actress, pop star.

31:59.177 --> 32:02.388
Hell, I might even do
something on Broadway next.

32:02.389 --> 32:06.100
So how about you work it out

32:06.101 --> 32:07.893
or I tell Barrett Hopper
that his next tweet

32:07.894 --> 32:10.563
should expose the fact
that you have been sleeping

32:10.564 --> 32:12.916
with Jordan Wilder
since he was underage.

32:16.152 --> 32:17.962
Fix it, Nina.

33:13.627 --> 33:15.878
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

33:15.879 --> 33:19.673
- I was just at an audition.
- No, wait. For what?

33:19.674 --> 33:21.508
It was just a local commercial.

33:21.509 --> 33:24.261
My mom's old agent has
been flagging open auditions

33:24.262 --> 33:25.804
and I've gone out on a few

33:25.805 --> 33:28.474
but I actually think they
might have booked this one.

33:28.475 --> 33:31.661
Oh, my God, Cass! That's amazing.

33:33.730 --> 33:34.938
Hey, you okay?

33:38.860 --> 33:41.045
Oh, you read it.

33:45.617 --> 33:48.452
The characters meet in their
freshman theater workshop.

33:48.453 --> 33:49.620
They become best friends

33:49.621 --> 33:52.640
and then they fall madly in love.

33:55.001 --> 33:57.711
It's Jake and me, isn't it?

33:57.712 --> 34:00.547
That's what he wanted
to happen, you know.

34:00.548 --> 34:02.859
- Happily ever after.
- Really?

34:05.345 --> 34:08.514
W-w-why didn't he tell me this?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.391
He was going to, Paige

34:10.391 --> 34:13.143
but then you booked this huge movie

34:13.143 --> 34:16.706
and he didn't wanna tie you down.

34:18.692 --> 34:21.527
So what are you gonna do?

34:21.527 --> 34:25.089
- I'm gonna call him.
- Good. You should.

34:41.672 --> 34:43.172
'Jake, it's me.'

34:43.174 --> 34:47.052
'I just, I just read your script.'

34:47.053 --> 34:50.514
It's so good, it's so beautiful

34:50.514 --> 34:54.268
it's so... about us.

34:54.268 --> 34:57.688
'T-that makes me ask,
w-why didn't you tell me?'

34:57.689 --> 34:59.569
'You know, why didn't
you tell me how you felt?'

34:59.570 --> 35:01.195
After-after that time that we kissed

35:01.196 --> 35:03.318
why didn't you just talk to me about it?

35:03.319 --> 35:06.280
Well, why did you keep pushing me away?

35:06.281 --> 35:09.074
God, that makes me so mad.

35:09.075 --> 35:11.702
And you know what makes
me even more mad is that

35:11.703 --> 35:14.347
you didn't even ask me how I felt.

35:16.583 --> 35:19.144
You know, maybe i-if you did..

35:21.921 --> 35:24.649
Maybe if you did, you'd still be here.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.663
What are you doing here?

36:13.598 --> 36:15.766
Hey, you okay? How are you?

36:15.767 --> 36:20.104
Well, you know, not great but here.

36:20.105 --> 36:21.497
Sober.

36:23.233 --> 36:24.918
So where's everybody else?

36:26.653 --> 36:28.195
We're the first.

36:28.196 --> 36:30.906
Really? Doesn't it start
in like a few minutes?

36:30.907 --> 36:32.741
I, uh..

36:32.742 --> 36:35.661
I think I sold or bartered my watch

36:35.662 --> 36:36.965
so I-I'll take your word for it.

36:38.206 --> 36:40.833
Oh, good. You're both here.

36:40.834 --> 36:43.919
Hi, Rainer. Uh, is Jordan here?

36:43.920 --> 36:46.797
Uh, no, I-I really think
we're the only ones here, Nina.

36:46.798 --> 36:51.260
Paige, come here a minute.
I need to ask you something.

36:51.261 --> 36:54.197
Look, I need you to work on Rainer.

36:56.266 --> 36:59.768
You need to get him in
the right mindset for this.

36:59.769 --> 37:00.853
He won't talk to me.

37:00.854 --> 37:03.814
No, I'm not really sure
what I can do, Nina.

37:03.815 --> 37:06.542
Well, he likes you. He'll listen to you.

37:07.902 --> 37:10.487
If we don't put on one hell
of a good show out there

37:10.488 --> 37:12.906
our investors who are on the fence

37:12.907 --> 37:14.199
they're not coming back.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.242
Okay.

37:15.243 --> 37:16.546
When you're up there and they're

37:16.547 --> 37:19.329
asking questions, just be positive.

37:19.330 --> 37:22.183
The film is great. You
and Rainer are happy.

37:24.043 --> 37:25.169
Umm..

37:25.170 --> 37:27.921
I'm not saying you have to lie.

37:27.922 --> 37:30.650
You do like each other and just..

37:31.718 --> 37:34.737
Show some unity. That's all I'm asking.

37:44.689 --> 37:46.648
What kind of lies did
she want you to spin?

37:46.649 --> 37:49.401
That I never did drink, that
was all a publicity stunt?

37:49.402 --> 37:52.154
- What?
- I don't know.

37:52.155 --> 37:53.864
I just know I'm gonna say the truth.

37:53.865 --> 37:56.867
I loved being in this
movie and with you.

37:56.868 --> 38:01.330
You've really made me a better actress.

38:01.331 --> 38:02.807
And I'm so grateful.

38:10.298 --> 38:12.382
I don't think I can do this.

38:12.383 --> 38:14.968
Hey, yes, you can. It'll be okay.

38:14.969 --> 38:16.352
I'm gonna be right there with you.

38:16.353 --> 38:17.953
You don't have to go through this alone.

38:17.977 --> 38:20.766
I-I mean, the movie.

38:20.767 --> 38:22.809
All of it. I..

38:22.810 --> 38:24.311
I think I'm done, Paige.

38:24.312 --> 38:26.414
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:28.399 --> 38:29.858
You remember that first press party

38:29.859 --> 38:31.985
we ever went to after I was cast?

38:31.986 --> 38:34.905
You remember what you said to me?

38:34.906 --> 38:38.033
You said that if I was
getting hounded by questions

38:38.034 --> 38:42.871
that I didn't wanna answer, I
could just throw up the sign.

38:42.872 --> 38:45.749
Remember R for rescue?

38:45.750 --> 38:47.793
So if you get up there and it's just

38:47.794 --> 38:50.063
i-it's too much to handle, I get it.

38:52.548 --> 38:54.359
And I'll be there.

39:01.557 --> 39:03.809
Alexis, unfortunately, as you know

39:03.810 --> 39:05.394
your sex tape with Rachel Davis

39:05.395 --> 39:08.021
has gone viral in just the past hour.

39:08.022 --> 39:10.023
There's been two
million tweets about it.

39:10.024 --> 39:13.360
It's all over Instagram and Facebook.

39:13.361 --> 39:15.904
Alright, I can't look at that.

39:15.905 --> 39:17.864
Who would've done this?

39:17.865 --> 39:20.033
Well, Rachel was the one who recorded it

39:20.034 --> 39:21.660
but I-I can't imagine..

39:21.661 --> 39:23.996
It's disappointing how a word got out.

39:23.997 --> 39:26.456
Are you upset because you've been outed

39:26.457 --> 39:29.084
or is it just the part
that you feel violated?

39:29.085 --> 39:30.961
I just, I don't, I don't like labels.

39:30.962 --> 39:34.840
You know, I'm not someone
that can be put into a box.

39:34.841 --> 39:36.591
'I guess, you could say'

39:36.592 --> 39:39.928
that I've always been bi or, or fluid.

39:39.929 --> 39:42.014
But, you know, I've never,
I've never hidden that.

39:42.015 --> 39:44.891
I really haven't, so it-it really just

39:44.892 --> 39:46.893
it's about the violation for me.

39:46.894 --> 39:50.314
So if you did this..

39:50.315 --> 39:52.524
...you should be ashamed.

39:52.525 --> 39:53.960
Who?

39:57.155 --> 39:59.215
The guilty party.

40:03.077 --> 40:05.100
- Seriously? We're...
- Oh, perfect, Jordan's here.

40:08.958 --> 40:10.834
'Thank you.'

40:10.835 --> 40:14.921
Thank you for coming, YA
fans and members of the press.

40:14.922 --> 40:16.673
And here to say a few words

40:16.674 --> 40:20.969
is the chairman and CEO of
Gold Brothers, Alan Mills.

40:20.970 --> 40:23.764
Ah, yes, it's been a
rough couple of days

40:23.765 --> 40:27.351
but this movie is back on track

40:27.352 --> 40:29.603
and so is Rainer.

40:29.604 --> 40:33.106
And know that he is getting
the help that he needs.

40:33.107 --> 40:35.484
What exactly is going
on with you, Rainer?

40:35.485 --> 40:37.194
You've been sober for over three years.

40:37.195 --> 40:38.921
Can you tell us what happened?

40:40.239 --> 40:43.033
Oh, Rainer, are you dating
your co-star, Paige Townsen?

40:43.034 --> 40:44.409
Did she reject you?

40:44.410 --> 40:46.193
'Rainer, are you taking drugs too?'

40:46.194 --> 40:47.996
'You have plans to enter rehab?'

40:47.997 --> 40:49.877
'Are you gonna shut down productions?'

40:49.878 --> 40:51.181
'Did she reject you?

40:51.182 --> 40:53.043
'She rejected you, didn't she?'

40:53.044 --> 40:56.088
Um, Rainer's recovery is private

40:56.089 --> 40:58.256
but I assure you as a cast

40:58.257 --> 41:01.802
we're really supportive of
one another. Um, thank you.

41:01.803 --> 41:05.639
But, Paige. Paige, are you
in fact dating Rainer Devon?

41:05.640 --> 41:08.034
'You two looked happy
in those "TMZ" photos.'

41:10.728 --> 41:13.105
'Wait, Paige.'

41:13.106 --> 41:14.582
Don't answer that.

41:18.236 --> 41:21.655
I just wanna say, for the record

41:21.656 --> 41:23.090
I wanna be with you.

41:24.617 --> 41:26.177
And, Paige..

41:28.079 --> 41:31.915
...I've wanted to be with
you from the day I met you.

41:31.916 --> 41:34.393
And you're right, I should
have told you earlier.

41:35.670 --> 41:37.230
But I'm telling you now.

41:38.714 --> 41:40.274
I love you.

41:42.927 --> 41:44.094
I always have.

41:44.095 --> 41:46.138
'So who are you dating, Paige?'

41:46.139 --> 41:48.366
'Are you with your
roommate or your co-star?'

41:53.312 --> 41:55.439
- Paige..
- Paige, who's it gonna be?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.566
- Which one is it?
- Rainer or Jake?

41:57.567 --> 42:00.444
'Is it your roommate or your co-star?'

42:00.445 --> 42:02.988
'This is a love triangle.
Who do you love?'

42:02.989 --> 42:05.332
'Rainer, what do you have
to say about all this?'

42:12.221 --> 42:19.721
