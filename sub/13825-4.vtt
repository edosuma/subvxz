CHEF [ON TV]:
<i>And this fermentation process...</i>

01:15.992 --> 01:19.078
<i>...combined with the skills
of the cheesemaster...</i>

01:19.078 --> 01:23.917
<i>...is what gives mozzarella
its exquisitely unique texture, color...</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:26.753
<i>...and its deliciously pungent scent.</i>

01:27.545 --> 01:30.632
<i>Mozzarella.</i>

01:30.632 --> 01:34.177
<i>Even the way it rolls
off your tongue is delicious.</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:40.016
<i>Mozzarella.
Mozzarella.</i>

01:40.433 --> 01:43.853
<i>Aah. That aroma of Rome.</i>

01:43.853 --> 01:46.356
<i>There's nothing
like cutting the cheese.</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:48.650
ANNOUNCER [ON TV]: <i>Ladies and
gentlemen, we just received word...</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:52.362
<i>...that a very dangerous penguin
has escaped from the city zoo.</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:54.697
<i>He is considered cute
and extremely hungry.</i>

01:54.697 --> 01:59.953
<i>Shut your windows, lock your doors,
and most of all, hide your refrigerators.</i>

03:42.722 --> 03:44.140
Thomas!

03:44.140 --> 03:46.142
What is going on down there?

03:47.268 --> 03:50.647
Thomas, what are you doing
in the freezer?

03:51.981 --> 03:55.401
Oh, just look at this horrible mess
you've made.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.863
This better be all cleaned up
by the time I get back.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.615
Got it?

06:24.842 --> 06:25.927
Ow!

07:16.060 --> 07:20.022
Oh, Thomas,
all this mess for an icy pop?

07:35.371 --> 07:38.374
CHEF [ON TV]: <i>Welcome back
to the</i> World of Cheese.

07:38.374 --> 07:43.004
<i>This time, I have Asiago,
Emmental, and Gorgonzola.</i>

08:14.243 --> 08:16.037
Blecch.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.337
Ahh...

10:15.531 --> 10:17.950
Hey, my ice-cream cart!

11:33.609 --> 11:36.362
Can you sign it,
"To my friend, Tuffy...

11:36.362 --> 11:40.032
...from his friend,
the Amazing Jerry"?

11:42.993 --> 11:44.537
Oh, thank you.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.997
Oh, <i>merci.</i>

14:47.511 --> 14:49.763
<i>Today on</i> Nature Untamed...

14:49.763 --> 14:52.891
<i>...we visit deepest,
darkest Africa.</i>

14:52.891 --> 14:55.686
<i>Considered the cradle
of civilization.</i>

14:56.145 --> 14:58.439
<i>Yet, for some lowly creatures...</i>

14:58.439 --> 15:03.027
<i>...the ancient landscape
is perilously uncivilized.</i>

15:03.027 --> 15:06.614
<i>The meekest of wild creatures
don't stand a chance...</i>

15:06.614 --> 15:11.118
<i>...against the ferocious,
carnivorous jungle cat.</i>

15:12.745 --> 15:17.333
<i>Watch now, as the slinking beast
skillfully tracks his prey.</i>

15:19.209 --> 15:21.962
<i>Oh. Hmm. Sorry.</i>

15:21.962 --> 15:23.631
<i>Carry on.</i>

20:25.474 --> 20:29.561
<i>As we close today's
chapter of</i> Nature Untamed...

20:29.561 --> 20:33.065
<i>...we discover that
even deep in the jungle...</i>

20:33.065 --> 20:36.401
<i>...the wildest of hearts
can be tamed.</i>

20:36.401 --> 20:41.240
<i>Aww. Love conquers all.</i>
