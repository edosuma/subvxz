00:17.066 --> 00:19.432
You gotta know this
is gonna be the longest ride of your life.

00:19.735 --> 00:21.703
Why'd you lie to us?

00:22.271 --> 00:25.172
What, just because he didn't write?
He left to support us.

00:25.341 --> 00:29.334
You think every man who's out of work
leaves their family for two years?

00:29.512 --> 00:31.980
Leaves their wife at home
to raise two kids alone?

00:32.148 --> 00:36.710
- Maybe that's the only choice he saw.
- Maybe it's the only choice he wanted to see.

00:37.053 --> 00:38.543
Maybe he just wanted out.

00:39.655 --> 00:42.681
He doesn't think you'd want him back.
That's what he told me.

00:43.559 --> 00:44.958
Guess he was right.

00:46.996 --> 00:49.556
Personally, if I were him,
that'd be music to my ears...

00:49.732 --> 00:52.360
...because I don't know who would
wanna come back to you.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.477
You will not talk to me like that.

01:07.883 --> 01:11.649
You don't know the first thing
about our marriage, or any marriage.

01:12.154 --> 01:13.678
Of course you adore him.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.484
People who ain't around
make very few mistakes.

01:17.293 --> 01:19.454
But he left.

01:20.162 --> 01:22.494
Just remember that. He left.

01:24.967 --> 01:27.561
You better control your mouth,
young lady.

01:27.737 --> 01:30.535
And don't you dare say a word
to your brother.

01:38.981 --> 01:40.243
Hey.

01:40.583 --> 01:41.948
Hey.

01:42.551 --> 01:43.575
Mm.

01:43.753 --> 01:45.744
Well, you ain't walking too funny.

01:45.921 --> 01:48.082
She couldn't have
whipped your ass that hard.

01:50.626 --> 01:52.491
What, you're not talking to me?

01:53.229 --> 01:56.289
You do know that you're not gonna
be able to keep that up, right?

01:58.501 --> 02:01.026
She may be the wicked bitch
of the west down here...

02:01.203 --> 02:02.932
...but take her to my neighborhood...

02:03.105 --> 02:05.903
- ...she'd fold like a pair of twos.
- Don't you call her that.

02:06.075 --> 02:09.442
- What? You say the same thing.
- I can talk about her that way. You can't.

02:10.246 --> 02:11.474
I knew what she was like.

02:11.647 --> 02:14.639
I shouldn't have let it get this far.
And I'm sorry I ever did.

02:16.819 --> 02:19.845
My mother won't let me see you
anymore outside of choir.

02:20.222 --> 02:22.452
What? No, no, no. Hey.

02:22.625 --> 02:23.887
Don't follow me.

02:24.960 --> 02:26.484
This is crazy.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.659
I love you.

02:59.061 --> 03:01.757
- You get my note?
- Mm-hm.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.558
I got it.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.160
Do you think that's an acceptable way
to say goodbye?

03:09.171 --> 03:13.164
Randy, I'll drive you anywhere
you want to go.

03:13.342 --> 03:17.039
No questions asked.
Even if it's out of this town forever.

03:17.213 --> 03:21.309
But, hon, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to grow a set.

03:23.819 --> 03:25.946
You can't spend your whole life running.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.783
Why should I stay?

03:27.957 --> 03:32.792
Vi Rose hates me. Olivia loves me,
but she won't go against her mother.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.897
There is one other reason
you might consider staying.

03:36.065 --> 03:38.397
- What is that?
- So you can sing with the choir...

03:38.567 --> 03:40.728
...in the finals in Los Angeles.

03:41.003 --> 03:44.632
That's right. Detroit got disqualified.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.104
How come?

03:46.308 --> 03:49.300
Because half their choir was made up
with paid professionals.

03:49.478 --> 03:51.173
I knew they couldn't be that good.

03:51.547 --> 03:52.809
How'd they get caught?

03:57.653 --> 03:59.621
It was you, wasn't it?

03:59.889 --> 04:02.881
<i>Pacashau thing.</i>

04:03.058 --> 04:04.582
Well, you're darn tooting.

04:04.760 --> 04:10.426
I mean, trying to fool me is like trying
to sneak sunrise past a rooster. Ha-ha.

04:10.599 --> 04:12.533
Those weaselly, no-good cheats.

04:13.335 --> 04:16.930
I tell you, you can't trust no one
outside of the state of Georgia.

04:17.139 --> 04:19.437
How many times I tell you
and your brother that?

04:19.608 --> 04:20.632
What you looking for?

04:20.809 --> 04:24.176
I'm looking for the other choir
who made the finals in our category.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.007
Don't you wanna know
who we going up against?

04:28.081 --> 04:29.742
- Maybe you got it wrong, G.G.
- No.

04:29.916 --> 04:32.544
Got it right here,
Our Lady of Perpetual Tears.

04:32.719 --> 04:35.187
I ain't never heard of them,
and I heard of everybody.

04:35.522 --> 04:37.956
They don't sound like
they'll be a barrel of laughs.

04:38.158 --> 04:40.058
Must be good if they made it to finals.

04:40.226 --> 04:43.093
It don't matter who they are.
Don't change what we do one bit.

04:43.263 --> 04:47.461
We just go to Los Angeles and we do
our very best. That's all we can do.

04:52.205 --> 04:54.935
What? What you two cooking up?

04:55.108 --> 04:58.600
I may not be on the council,
but I am its largest contributor.

04:58.778 --> 05:02.771
And I will see to it we get to the finals
under one condition.

05:03.116 --> 05:04.549
Oh.

05:04.717 --> 05:06.378
And what is that?

05:06.553 --> 05:09.351
You have to do new songs,
and use Randy's arrangements.

05:09.522 --> 05:13.322
It is the right thing to do, Vi.
Our town needs to win.

05:13.660 --> 05:15.628
Please, Mama, for once, don't be stubborn.

05:15.795 --> 05:18.992
You're the only one in the whole choir
who doesn't want to do it.

05:19.566 --> 05:22.467
You're right.
So maybe I should be the one to leave.

05:23.703 --> 05:25.068
Vi.

05:25.238 --> 05:27.069
You'll finally be choirmaster.

05:27.574 --> 05:29.439
I guess you finally got what you wanted.

06:17.624 --> 06:20.923
I guess people really can do
without a hammer after all.

06:41.581 --> 06:43.549
Hi, Miss G.G.

06:49.322 --> 06:53.088
Vi, I had no idea
you had to take another job.

06:54.194 --> 06:56.890
- You have to come back to the choir.
- I'm busy.

06:57.063 --> 06:59.258
I don't know what
you're so ticked off about.

06:59.432 --> 07:01.525
I'm the one that got passed over
for the job.

07:01.701 --> 07:04.693
And now I'm asking you to take it.

07:05.004 --> 07:07.199
You just don't like me, do you?

07:07.507 --> 07:08.701
And you never really have.

07:08.875 --> 07:09.899
Amen, sister.

07:10.343 --> 07:12.106
Well, why? I'd like to know.

07:13.713 --> 07:15.442
Why? Hmm.

07:15.615 --> 07:19.574
Maybe it's the way you undermine me
or the way you tried to blackmail me.

07:19.752 --> 07:22.277
Well, now, that was
a little shortsighted, I admit.

07:22.455 --> 07:27.017
But sometimes a small sin is justified
in the pursuit of a higher purpose.

07:27.193 --> 07:28.785
And that's another thing.

07:28.962 --> 07:31.897
That condescending,
wise-old-owl thing you do.

07:32.065 --> 07:33.692
It must really gripe your ass...

07:33.866 --> 07:36.266
...to know there's somebody
that you can't charm.

07:36.436 --> 07:39.064
"G.G.'s so hilarious, she's so earthy."

07:39.239 --> 07:40.729
Well, I am who I am.

07:40.907 --> 07:43.137
Maybe you were, five procedures ago.

07:43.309 --> 07:46.403
Now you whoever you need to be
to make everybody love you.

07:46.579 --> 07:48.479
"Oh, G.G.'s so larger than life."

07:48.648 --> 07:49.910
Well, it pisses me off.

07:52.585 --> 07:55.315
You want to know what pisses me off?

07:55.488 --> 07:57.422
- Not particularly.
- You are gonna hear it.

07:57.590 --> 08:00.252
- It is your holier-than-thou...
- Oomph!

08:00.426 --> 08:01.825
...pious, rigid...

08:01.995 --> 08:04.054
...self-righteousness.

08:04.230 --> 08:07.165
Who gives a rat's ass
if I've got a few little nips and tucks.

08:07.367 --> 08:09.961
God didn't make plastic surgeons
so they could starve.

08:10.136 --> 08:12.434
But you could use a complete face lift.

08:13.306 --> 08:14.637
I feel fine about myself.

08:14.807 --> 08:18.436
Well, I don't see how you could,
you old, hateful heifer.

08:18.611 --> 08:21.478
Your daughter didn't even come
to her own father's funeral.

08:21.648 --> 08:24.947
You are so convinced your way
is the only way there is.

08:25.118 --> 08:28.519
Infallible, untouchable,
unlovable Vi Rose Hill.

08:28.688 --> 08:31.156
Quit it with those nails,
Edward Scissorhands.

08:31.324 --> 08:33.087
When did you get so old?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.784
You're 40, going on 100.

08:35.962 --> 08:39.453
I'm old? You read the Bible to reminisce.

08:39.631 --> 08:41.121
Ha!
- Yeah, what?

08:41.301 --> 08:44.998
I'm talking about inside, Vi.
You are old inside.

08:45.171 --> 08:47.867
Hmm.
- And I wish, just one time...

08:48.041 --> 08:50.669
...you'd try to see things
from my point of view.

08:50.843 --> 08:53.334
I'd love to see things
from your point of view...

08:53.513 --> 08:56.641
...but I just can't seem to stick my head
that far up my ass.

08:56.816 --> 08:58.113
Oh, you just....

08:58.284 --> 09:00.548
Hey, hey.
- I'm so sick of you, I could puke.

09:02.789 --> 09:04.222
- Ow! Ow!
- What?

09:04.390 --> 09:06.324
You see, I tried.
She hit me with water.

09:06.492 --> 09:08.050
- She hit me with rolls.
- Let go.

09:08.227 --> 09:10.457
You know the rolls
in here are hard as hell.

09:10.630 --> 09:13.326
Stop it. Ow!
- See, get this. Get this.

09:13.499 --> 09:18.027
Well, you're breaking my hair. Would you
stop. It took me a half a day to do this.

09:18.204 --> 09:20.263
- I could tear this hair up right now.
- Ah, don't.

09:20.440 --> 09:22.635
Wouldn't you like that?
Wouldn't you like that, huh?

09:22.809 --> 09:25.835
My doctor does good liposuction too,
if you'd like his card.

09:26.012 --> 09:27.411
- Get this on there.
- I got it.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.673
- Yeah. Put that online.
- Vi Rose.

09:30.350 --> 09:31.374
Wha...?

09:32.819 --> 09:35.344
- Ladies, that's enough. That is enough.
- Ow!

09:35.521 --> 09:37.148
What are we doing?

09:37.323 --> 09:41.521
Well, I'll tell you what I'm not doing,
I'm not coming back to the choir.

09:41.694 --> 09:43.161
Well, Vi Rose, you are fired.

09:43.329 --> 09:45.661
- I'm fired?
- Yes.

09:45.865 --> 09:49.198
You didn't...? Didn't you...? You...?

09:50.403 --> 09:53.531
- This is all your fault.
- No, no. That's enough, that's enough.

09:57.577 --> 09:59.044
Vi.

10:23.069 --> 10:25.367
G.G., we are not going out like this.

10:25.538 --> 10:28.132
Not you, not me and not this choir.

10:28.307 --> 10:32.368
Sweetheart, sometimes you just
have to know when to fold your cards.

10:33.146 --> 10:34.545
Who are you?

10:34.714 --> 10:37.114
You are not my gorgeous grandma.

10:42.422 --> 10:44.049
I know that song.

10:44.223 --> 10:46.919
Yeah, I used to sing it
with your granddaddy.

10:47.093 --> 10:51.154
Then he used to waltz me
around that big old yard.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.324
I know how much you miss him.

10:56.536 --> 11:00.131
God, it's just like my heart
don't beat right anymore.

11:00.473 --> 11:04.842
It's like, when he was here,
I felt like I could just do anything.

11:05.311 --> 11:07.040
Not now.

11:08.681 --> 11:10.410
Can I hear the song?

11:10.583 --> 11:12.551
No. It's a duet.

11:14.153 --> 11:16.348
Well, I know it.

11:16.589 --> 11:18.955
God knows I heard it enough times.

11:34.006 --> 11:36.975
<i>I could hold out my arms</i>

11:37.143 --> 11:39.941
<i>Say, "I love you this much"</i>

11:40.680 --> 11:47.483
<i>I could tell you how long
I will long for your touch</i>

11:48.688 --> 11:55.025
<i>How much and how far
Would I go to prove</i>

11:56.496 --> 12:03.493
<i>The depth and the breadth
Of my love for you?</i>

12:04.504 --> 12:10.101
<i>- From here to the moon and back
- From here to the moon and back</i>

12:11.310 --> 12:13.642
<i>- Who else in this world
- Who else in this world</i>

12:14.280 --> 12:17.647
<i>- Will love you like that?
- Will love you like that?</i>

12:19.151 --> 12:21.915
<i>- Love everlasting
- Love everlasting</i>

12:22.088 --> 12:25.455
<i>- I promise you that
- I promise you that</i>

12:26.926 --> 12:34.628
<i>- From here to the moon and back

12:36.102 --> 12:40.732
<i>- From here to the moon and back

12:42.875 --> 12:48.939
<i>I want you to know
You can always depend</i>

12:49.115 --> 12:55.384
<i>On promises made
And love without end</i>

12:57.123 --> 13:02.857
<i>No need to wonder
How faithful I'll be</i>

13:05.031 --> 13:11.698

13:43.970 --> 13:50.239

14:26.946 --> 14:33.146
<i>I would blow you a kiss
From the star where I sat</i>

14:33.319 --> 14:35.787
<i>I would call out your name</i>

14:35.955 --> 14:41.416
<i>To echo through the vast</i>

14:44.397 --> 14:47.230
<i>Thank heaven for you</i>

14:47.400 --> 14:51.496

14:52.071 --> 14:57.566
<i>- From here to the moon and back

14:58.244 --> 15:01.577

15:06.318 --> 15:14.318

15:21.734 --> 15:26.228
<i>From here to the moon</i>

15:26.405 --> 15:30.933
<i>And back</i>

15:45.458 --> 15:48.052
You can still do anything.

15:51.430 --> 15:52.727
You're damn skippy.

15:57.603 --> 16:00.037
Just stay for one rehearsal.

16:00.206 --> 16:04.267
Those people worked so hard.
And your ego's letting them all down.

16:04.443 --> 16:05.467
My ego?

16:05.711 --> 16:07.440
Didn't you teach us to never quit?

16:07.613 --> 16:11.811
Look at Walter. He'll have to go through
more than you and I will ever have to.

16:11.984 --> 16:14.851
But he doesn't quit. Not ever.

16:15.888 --> 16:19.016
Well, if you quit now,
you're quitting on God.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.752
What's that supposed to teach him?

16:25.865 --> 16:30.598
Okay. Five, six, seven, eight.
Pah, pah, pah, unh.

16:30.770 --> 16:34.706
Okay, come on, G.G. Here we go.
Unh, unh, unh.

16:34.874 --> 16:37.138
Okay, good. Let's go. Come on, Caleb.

16:37.309 --> 16:40.767
Earla, you already killed one man.
I got high blood pressure too, you know?

16:40.946 --> 16:43.346
- It's for the Lord, people.
- Pah, pah, pah, unh.

16:43.516 --> 16:45.507
Come on. Yeah.

16:45.684 --> 16:46.810
Pah, pah, pah, unh.

16:46.986 --> 16:49.079
Earla, get your Beyoncé out of my face.

16:50.689 --> 16:51.849
It's coming down.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.827
Pah, pah, pah, pah.

17:05.337 --> 17:08.670
Oh, sorry. Just popping for the Lord.

17:16.348 --> 17:19.146
Our band is good,
but they ain't never gonna be great.

17:22.755 --> 17:24.551
Not without some help.

17:35.568 --> 17:38.867
- What do you want?
- You. And your guitar.

17:39.038 --> 17:40.733
You must be out your mind.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.064
I heard you play all my life.

17:43.242 --> 17:46.609
All those summer house-party jams.
You're incredible, Manny.

17:46.779 --> 17:48.872
You know we're going to L.A., right?

17:49.048 --> 17:50.811
Thousands of people in the audience.

17:50.983 --> 17:53.543
Someone could hear you
who might actually matter.

17:55.821 --> 17:58.255
That ain't never gonna happen
in Pacashau.

18:09.235 --> 18:11.100
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

18:11.270 --> 18:13.238
I'm not feeling it, Earla.

18:13.405 --> 18:17.933
Maybe what you need
is something to feel.

18:19.745 --> 18:20.871
Yo, what's up?

18:43.335 --> 18:44.597
Oh!

18:44.770 --> 18:45.794
You're the man.

18:51.644 --> 18:53.612
Oh, yeah, that's easy.

18:54.446 --> 18:56.607
- Whoo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
Mm-hm.

18:56.782 --> 18:58.545
Aah!

19:02.154 --> 19:05.715
This morning, the choir's got something
a little different to sing for y'all.

19:13.132 --> 19:14.258
<i>Oh</i>

19:14.800 --> 19:18.668
<i>Do you know what
What you mean to me?</i>

19:18.837 --> 19:20.771
<i>My world was turning upside down</i>

19:20.940 --> 19:23.101
<i>I would've been so lost without you</i>

19:23.275 --> 19:27.268
<i>You are all that perfect love should be</i>

19:27.446 --> 19:29.937
<i>You came and saved me from myself</i>

19:30.115 --> 19:31.844
<i>You leave him to me.</i>

19:32.017 --> 19:33.678
<i>- This is bigger than a notion
- Notion</i>

19:33.852 --> 19:35.786
<i>- Freely give you my devotion
- Uh-huh</i>

19:35.955 --> 19:40.324
<i>Never thought I'd find someone
Who loves the way you do</i>

19:40.492 --> 19:42.357
<i>- It does so much, I wanna tell it</i>
<i>Uh-huh</i>

19:42.528 --> 19:44.257
<i>Feels so good, I wanna yell it</i>

19:44.430 --> 19:46.330
<i>I surrender everything I am</i>

19:46.498 --> 19:50.628
<i>To you and only you I'm yours</i>

19:50.803 --> 19:53.135
Let me guess,
you didn't like it.

19:53.305 --> 19:55.773
Frankly, I'm surprised at Vi Rose.

19:55.941 --> 19:59.206
Oh, don't blame her. Randy had to drag her
kicking and screaming.

19:59.378 --> 20:02.643
- So it was his doing.
- Well, it was everyone's doing.

20:02.815 --> 20:07.047
The choir goes back to its old style
or I withdraw the competition application.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.212
And as for Randy,
we just can't take a chance.

20:11.924 --> 20:13.721
You don't want Randy in the choir?

20:13.892 --> 20:16.952
There's too much at stake.
I've known that boy his whole life.

20:17.129 --> 20:20.496
- He's just had a couple of bad breaks, is all.
- He kidnapped Olivia Hill.

20:20.666 --> 20:22.998
Oh, they ran away. They came right back.

20:23.168 --> 20:25.261
He completely changed
the way the choir sings.

20:25.437 --> 20:28.463
- Who knows what he'll do next.
- We'll lose, Pastor.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.938
Why, I love those old songs
better than anybody.

20:31.110 --> 20:32.372
I helped Bernie write them.

20:32.544 --> 20:35.377
But Randy's right,
we gotta shake them up.

20:35.547 --> 20:38.311
Without being sponsored by a church,
you cannot perform.

20:38.484 --> 20:41.351
Those are competition rules.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.151
Well, you withdraw your support...

20:45.357 --> 20:48.986
...you leave me no choice
but to withdraw my support.

20:49.595 --> 20:51.426
If you know what I'm saying.

20:51.597 --> 20:53.724
He's my family.

20:56.935 --> 20:59.995
Well, I suppose you'll have to follow
your conscience...

21:00.372 --> 21:01.737
...and I'll follow mine.

21:07.479 --> 21:10.880
Oh, I shushed those loud boys
during your sermon.

21:11.050 --> 21:13.610
I told them people were sleeping.

21:16.155 --> 21:17.782
California, here we come.

21:31.437 --> 21:34.270
I don't know why we're even bothering
without Randy.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.408
And singing those old arrangements.

21:36.575 --> 21:37.599
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

21:40.112 --> 21:41.511
You all right?

21:42.915 --> 21:46.749
It seems like God's using me
for target practice these days.

21:47.453 --> 21:49.978
Makes it kind of hard to feel the spirit.

21:50.222 --> 21:52.019
Caleb, he is God.

21:52.191 --> 21:55.024
If he wanted to shoot you,
he wouldn't miss.

21:55.194 --> 21:57.628
Heh, trust me,
you'll feel his spirit again.

21:57.796 --> 21:59.787
And when you do, you'd better look out.

22:56.188 --> 22:58.213
What's going on? Did you just hit me?

22:58.390 --> 22:59.914
You were snoring.

23:00.092 --> 23:03.186
So? I got a lot to snore about.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.023
Where you going?

23:09.535 --> 23:11.162
To the bathroom.

23:12.704 --> 23:14.797
With your shoes on?

23:15.274 --> 23:16.468
Get back in the bed.

23:19.912 --> 23:21.903
Olivia Hill, don't you walk out that door.

23:22.181 --> 23:24.172
I'm not a kid anymore.

23:24.516 --> 23:26.541
Only kids say that.

23:28.954 --> 23:31.980
You make me run,
it'll be the last thing you do.

23:33.425 --> 23:36.861
Can you actually believe I'm gonna
let you wander the streets by yourself?

23:37.029 --> 23:39.156
- Something could happen to you.
- Like you care.

23:39.331 --> 23:41.993
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- It means you hate me.

23:42.167 --> 23:45.034
Anybody would think you were dropped
on your head. Get back in that room.

23:45.204 --> 23:47.399
You do. You hate me. Don't deny it.

23:47.573 --> 23:50.235
Now, I know it feels like Randy
is the sun and the moon...

23:50.409 --> 23:53.810
...and the stars all wrapped up
in one right now but, baby, look around.

23:53.979 --> 23:57.745
Nobody ends up with the boy they liked
when they were 16. You'll get over him.

23:57.916 --> 23:59.349
This isn't about that.

23:59.518 --> 24:02.419
I told him I don't want to see him anymore
because you made me.

24:02.588 --> 24:04.453
This is about me.

24:06.358 --> 24:08.690
- Why do you think I hate you?
- Lots of reasons.

24:08.860 --> 24:11.624
- Name one.
- Because I'm pretty.

24:11.797 --> 24:14.698
- Heh, excuse me?
- Don't bug your eyes out at me.

24:15.267 --> 24:17.963
You hate that I'm pretty,
because you don't feel pretty.

24:18.470 --> 24:19.903
I defended you to Randy.

24:20.072 --> 24:23.803
But now, I'm just trying to cut through
the bullshit, Mama. Once and for all.

24:23.976 --> 24:27.275
You know how sad that is?
For you to feel that way about yourself?

24:27.446 --> 24:29.937
You are the only one
you hate more than me.

24:30.115 --> 24:32.310
No matter how much you sing
that church music...

24:32.484 --> 24:35.544
...God doesn't seem interested
in helping you out with that.

24:36.822 --> 24:41.486
Don't you bring God into your ugly,
petty, adolescent bullshit.

24:42.094 --> 24:45.188
That's right, I can cuss too.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

24:45.364 --> 24:48.925
It's lazy and it has no class,
but it's not hard.

24:49.301 --> 24:51.599
- You think I'm not pretty?
- I didn't say that.

24:51.770 --> 24:55.433
I am an incandescent, board-certified
supermodel, baby.

24:55.707 --> 24:58.369
I happen not to flaunt it
because I am a married woman...

24:58.543 --> 25:02.809
...and I would never disrespect my husband
the way you just disrespected your mother.

25:04.249 --> 25:07.844
But beautiful as you are,
and you are very, very beautiful...

25:08.020 --> 25:11.717
...I would hang mirrors all over my house
if I could, just to look at myself.

25:11.890 --> 25:15.553
I'd put one on the refrigerator just to
watch myself eat all of them calories.

25:15.727 --> 25:20.130
And if I gave myself a heart attack from
all that food, I'd just give myself CPR.

25:20.499 --> 25:24.230
Because I'm a nurse.
That's right, I save lives.

25:24.403 --> 25:26.098
And that is not bullshit.

25:27.005 --> 25:30.202
Now I am through talking to you
for the foreseeable future...

25:30.375 --> 25:34.744
...so my advice to you would be to get your
little narrow behind back in that room...

25:34.913 --> 25:39.976
...get back in that bed, and you treat my
snoring like it is a Marvin Gaye love song.

25:40.152 --> 25:44.418
That's right, you respect my snoring.
Because it comes from exhaustion.

25:44.589 --> 25:47.649
From working hard to put food in you
and your brother's stomachs...

25:47.826 --> 25:50.021
...and every stitch of clothes
on y'alls' backs.

25:50.195 --> 25:51.287
Get in that room.

26:13.218 --> 26:15.049
You didn't have to stay behind for me.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.415
Oh, I didn't.

26:17.589 --> 26:19.682
I'm flying out with the pastor.

26:19.925 --> 26:24.726
I don't think I could do three days cooped
up in a bus with those hot messes.

26:24.896 --> 26:29.094
But I'm not done yet. I've been calling
every church in this town...

26:29.267 --> 26:32.668
...trying to see if I can get
somebody else to sponsor us instead.

26:32.838 --> 26:35.306
- And?
- Well, no luck so far.

26:36.675 --> 26:39.166
I keep trying to think
what your granddaddy might do.

26:39.511 --> 26:43.038
He'd probably say not to put yourself
through this anymore.

26:43.949 --> 26:46.349
I mean, he loved that church,
but he loved you more.

26:48.086 --> 26:49.451
What'd you just say?

26:50.122 --> 26:52.215
I said he loved that church,
but he loved you more.

26:54.359 --> 26:56.418
He loved that church,
but he loved me more.

26:56.595 --> 26:58.927
Bernie, you old son of a Baptist.

26:59.097 --> 27:01.361
I read you loud and clear. Ha-ha.

27:01.633 --> 27:03.123
I know what to do.

27:03.301 --> 27:05.098
I know what to do.

27:06.872 --> 27:08.601
- Stop.
- I know what to do.

27:11.143 --> 27:12.701
I know what to do.

27:13.478 --> 27:14.536
Really?

27:21.420 --> 27:23.820
We're in Los Angeles. There's the sign.

27:37.569 --> 27:39.935
Hey, good morning, Pastor.

27:40.105 --> 27:41.868
What are you doing here?

27:43.308 --> 27:45.276
- What's that?
- Well, it's Randy's ticket...

27:45.444 --> 27:47.309
...to the Joyful Noise finals.

27:47.479 --> 27:50.380
It's the certificate
for the establishment of a church.

27:50.549 --> 27:51.846
That's right.

27:52.017 --> 27:55.316
Did you know that anyone can become
legally ordained as a minister?

27:55.487 --> 27:57.978
You can do it online,
just takes five minutes.

27:58.156 --> 28:01.319
Pastor G.G.
Has a nice ring to it, don't it?

28:01.493 --> 28:04.291
The competition folks
don't care what church sponsors...

28:04.463 --> 28:05.794
...as long as somebody does.

28:05.964 --> 28:08.831
Well, I'd prefer to be sponsored
by this church.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.767
But I told you once before,
I will not let you screw with my family.

28:14.206 --> 28:18.836
Now, we have exactly
one hour and 47 minutes...

28:19.010 --> 28:23.947
...to drive 92 miles to the airport if he's
gonna make it in time for the show tonight.

28:24.115 --> 28:27.278
Oh, don't do something
we're gonna all look back on and regret.

28:33.024 --> 28:35.356
Oh, my God, we're never gonna make it.
Step on it.

28:35.527 --> 28:37.995
If we have an accident,
we'll certainly never make it.

28:38.163 --> 28:41.360
- Are you crazy? Step on the gas.
- Well, fine.

28:55.347 --> 28:59.807
Pacashau Choir, your dressing room's
gonna be on the other side of the stage.

29:00.652 --> 29:02.745
Oh, look.

29:02.921 --> 29:04.115
Oh.

29:11.263 --> 29:14.198
People are gonna fill all those seats?

29:14.699 --> 29:16.098
No.

29:17.002 --> 29:19.061
Go for house lights.

29:24.409 --> 29:27.071
People are gonna fill all those seats.

29:30.081 --> 29:32.447
Lunch is being set up in the foyer.

29:44.129 --> 29:48.122
- Um, is this seat taken?
- Only by you.

29:50.502 --> 29:51.696
How do you do?

29:51.870 --> 29:55.806
I'm from Pacashau Sacred Divinity Choir.
Earla Hughes.

29:59.911 --> 30:03.312
He had high blood pressure.

30:08.553 --> 30:10.384
That's weird.

30:15.026 --> 30:16.755
Hey, are you okay?

30:17.028 --> 30:18.427
It's all right.

30:19.164 --> 30:22.827
Mr. Hsu was the first man
I had been with in four years.

30:24.502 --> 30:28.097
Do you think God was trying to punish me
because we weren't married?

30:28.273 --> 30:29.865
Girl, if that's how he operated...

30:30.041 --> 30:33.067
...most men would be dead
by their senior year in college.

30:33.545 --> 30:36.810
You are a beautiful, intelligent woman.

30:36.982 --> 30:39.450
And I know you will meet
a wonderful guy.

30:39.618 --> 30:42.781
I'll tell you what. If you're right,
I'll dance a jig and do a split.

30:44.322 --> 30:47.189
She said if I'm right,
she gonna do a split.

30:49.294 --> 30:50.522
I'd like to see that.

30:53.365 --> 30:54.832
Look. Look.

31:00.305 --> 31:01.533
Let's go. Let's go.

31:22.427 --> 31:23.758
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:23.928 --> 31:28.490
...welcome to the finals
of the National Joyful Noise Competition.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.794
Y'all ready? Here we go.

31:30.969 --> 31:33.164
<i>Take a load off your mind</i>

31:33.338 --> 31:35.397
<i>Ride the mighty glory</i>

31:35.573 --> 31:38.838
<i>Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high</i>

31:39.010 --> 31:41.444
<i>Take a load off your mind</i>

31:41.613 --> 31:43.672
<i>Ride the mighty glory</i>

31:43.848 --> 31:47.045
<i>Listen to my story
Ride the mighty high</i>

31:47.385 --> 31:50.980
I really liked your choir.
I thought you guys were good.

31:53.692 --> 31:56.456
Let's, uh, find somewhere we can talk.

32:07.305 --> 32:09.603
Can I give you some advice?

32:09.808 --> 32:12.003
Don't stay mad so long at your mama...

32:12.177 --> 32:13.667
...and go get that boy.

32:13.845 --> 32:15.938
Trust me, your mama will get over it...

32:16.114 --> 32:19.743
...and you'll both forget what it is
you got mad about to start with.

32:19.918 --> 32:23.877
- I'm afraid it's already too late.
- No, the clock ain't run out yet.

32:24.589 --> 32:27.023
He's still seeing you like a little girl.

32:27.192 --> 32:28.921
You gotta show him a woman.

32:30.528 --> 32:35.966
<i>Come on and ride the mighty high</i>

32:36.134 --> 32:38.500
Y'all ready to hear some
good music tonight?

32:38.670 --> 32:44.370
<i>- Come on and ride the mighty high
- Ride the mighty high</i>

32:44.542 --> 32:47.477
Because there's some folks back there
who are ready to sing for you.

32:59.724 --> 33:01.589
You look amazing.

33:11.236 --> 33:13.170
Mm-hm.

33:34.759 --> 33:37.227
Excuse me, Miss Hughes?

33:40.865 --> 33:41.957
Oh....

33:42.133 --> 33:43.657
They're my warm-ups.

33:43.835 --> 33:46.668
"Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat."

33:46.838 --> 33:49.363
- Mm-hm.
- My name's Justin.

33:49.541 --> 33:52.032
Hi. Earla Hughes.

33:52.744 --> 33:55.008
I know who you are.

33:56.614 --> 33:59.606
I've been following your choir
from competition to competition.

33:59.784 --> 34:02.116
- Why would you do that?
- For you.

34:02.887 --> 34:05.879
Wow, that really made it sound like
you need a restraining order.

34:06.057 --> 34:07.854
It was only two competitions.

34:08.025 --> 34:11.484
And I happened to be in Georgia,
because I'm moving there for work.

34:12.697 --> 34:15.291
Look, I know I don't know you...

34:15.466 --> 34:18.731
...but you just seem so...

34:19.204 --> 34:20.637
...special.

34:23.775 --> 34:24.799
Is that creepy?

34:28.279 --> 34:31.146
This may seem like a strange question...

34:31.549 --> 34:33.880
...but you don't have high blood pressure,
do you?

34:34.152 --> 34:38.418
That is a strange question, but no.
I'm healthy as an ox.

34:39.123 --> 34:41.489
- Ah....
- People in my family live to be 90.

35:01.079 --> 35:02.478
Uh-uh!

35:05.283 --> 35:11.188
<i>Come on and ride the mighty high</i>

35:11.356 --> 35:13.483
<i>If you're in trouble</i>

35:13.658 --> 35:17.424
<i>Come on and ride</i>

35:17.595 --> 35:20.195
<i>The mighty high</i>

35:54.599 --> 35:58.160
Oh, my God, you're all grown-up.

36:00.972 --> 36:02.940
How did I not notice?

36:03.775 --> 36:06.573
- This must be for that boy.
- Like you care.

36:06.744 --> 36:10.373
Hey. It gives me no joy
to see you unhappy.

36:10.548 --> 36:12.106
Don't you know that?

36:12.283 --> 36:13.875
I love you.

36:14.052 --> 36:16.452
And I'm very, very proud
to be your mother.

36:18.489 --> 36:20.480
And you love me too.

36:20.658 --> 36:23.092
Otherwise you wouldn't
be hugging me right now.

36:24.095 --> 36:26.586
- I'm not hugging you.
- Any second now.

36:27.098 --> 36:30.329
Don't try to fight it.
You know it's gonna feel so good.

36:32.337 --> 36:33.565
There we go.

36:35.506 --> 36:37.201
- I'm sorry, Mama.
- Oh....

36:37.375 --> 36:40.367
- I don't know what's wrong with me.
- Girl, you 16.

36:40.545 --> 36:43.343
And let's face it, your life
has been no day at the beach.

36:43.514 --> 36:45.846
<i>Please welcome our first finalist...</i>

36:46.017 --> 36:47.416
<i>...from Pensacola, Florida...</i>

36:47.585 --> 36:49.075
That's our competition.

36:49.253 --> 36:50.948
...Our Lady of Perpetual Tears.

36:58.863 --> 37:02.492
<i>Why can't we be humble</i>

37:02.667 --> 37:05.033
<i>Like the good Lord said?</i>

37:05.269 --> 37:07.567
<i>He promised to exalt us</i>

37:07.739 --> 37:09.036
<i>And show us the way</i>

37:10.341 --> 37:13.242
<i>Why are men so greedy?</i>

37:14.946 --> 37:16.243
They're kids?

37:16.414 --> 37:19.474
I've got a bad feeling about this.

37:19.717 --> 37:20.877
Are you hearing that kid?

37:21.052 --> 37:23.919
<i>That's the way God planned it</i>

37:24.088 --> 37:26.989
<i>- That's the way God wants it
- To be</i>

37:27.158 --> 37:29.524
<i>- He wants it to be
- Ooh</i>

37:29.694 --> 37:32.026
<i>- Be, yeah

37:32.196 --> 37:33.686
<i>Oh</i>

37:40.405 --> 37:42.737
<i>He wants it to be</i>

37:43.574 --> 37:46.771
<i>Oh, you gotta believe</i>

37:47.512 --> 37:50.743
<i>Let not your heart be troubled</i>

37:50.915 --> 37:53.543
<i>Let all your suffering cease</i>

37:53.718 --> 37:56.084
<i>Just learn how to help one another</i>

37:56.387 --> 37:58.082
<i>And live in perfect peace</i>

37:58.923 --> 38:01.619
<i>If we just be humble</i>

38:02.093 --> 38:05.290
<i>Like the good Lord said</i>

38:05.463 --> 38:07.556
<i>He promised to exalt us</i>

38:07.732 --> 38:09.461

38:09.634 --> 38:12.967
<i>- That's the way God planned it

38:13.137 --> 38:15.799
<i>That's the way God wants it to be</i>

38:15.973 --> 38:19.170
<i>- Ooh</i>

<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

38:22.580 --> 38:25.708
<i>That's the way God planned it</i>

38:25.883 --> 38:28.818
<i>- That's the way he wants it to

38:29.353 --> 38:33.449
<i>- To be, hey, yeah, yeah

38:33.624 --> 38:36.684

<i>So you best be humble

38:45.069 --> 38:47.902
<i>You better make it happen

39:00.918 --> 39:03.978
<i>- So let's help each other

39:04.155 --> 39:08.023
<i>And live</i>

39:08.192 --> 39:10.319
<i>I hope you get the message</i>

39:10.728 --> 39:14.824
<i>Where you won't Somebody will</i>

39:14.999 --> 39:19.060
<i>You may not understand me
But I will love you still</i>

39:19.237 --> 39:21.102
<i>- That's the way

<i>- You gotta believe it

40:11.889 --> 40:14.790
<i>- Yeah

40:17.395 --> 40:19.920
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

40:20.097 --> 40:26.798
<i>- That's the way
- That's the way</i>

40:40.551 --> 40:42.576
There's no way.
I mean, we've come this far.

40:42.753 --> 40:44.084
Okay. Okay. All right.

40:44.255 --> 40:46.553
It's not fair. How are we supposed
to compete with that?

40:46.724 --> 40:48.521
Especially doing our old, tired songs.

40:49.927 --> 40:53.124
And even if we win, we're beating a bunch
of little kids. It don't feel right.

40:54.498 --> 40:55.863
"Don't feel right"?

40:56.400 --> 40:59.267
What are we gonna do?
I mean, what are we gonna do?

41:02.640 --> 41:03.937
Hey.

41:04.942 --> 41:07.001
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

41:07.511 --> 41:12.380
You're getting all squishy and sentimental
over a bunch of 12-year-olds? Now?

41:13.417 --> 41:15.146
They knew what they
were getting into.

41:15.319 --> 41:17.219
Their parents signed
the permission slips.

41:17.388 --> 41:19.549
This is the big time, baby.

41:19.724 --> 41:22.249
Didn't Jesus say
"suffer the little children"?

41:22.426 --> 41:23.688
Yes, he did.

41:23.861 --> 41:26.591
They're young. They're resilient.
They'll get over it.

41:27.598 --> 41:28.929
We deserve this.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.295
Now y'all can donate
to Save the Children later.

41:31.469 --> 41:32.936
Become a Big Brother, whatever.

41:33.104 --> 41:36.972
But today, we are gonna go out there
and we are gonna win this thing.

41:37.575 --> 41:38.906
Come on, y'all. Let's go.

41:39.076 --> 41:41.909
This is Pacashau. What would Bernie do?
Come on, now.

41:43.414 --> 41:44.904
<i>Pacashau. Pacashau.</i>

42:02.600 --> 42:04.033
One, two.

42:04.602 --> 42:08.094
<i>Not enough, not enough, not enough love</i>

42:08.272 --> 42:11.639

<i>Not enough, not enough

<i>Not enough, not enough

42:24.055 --> 42:27.081
<i>Not enough, not enough
Not enough love</i>

42:27.258 --> 42:29.123
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

42:29.860 --> 42:31.953
It's not enough love.

42:32.129 --> 42:33.391
It's not enough love.

42:34.632 --> 42:37.192
The Lord is worthy to be praised,
is he not?

42:37.368 --> 42:38.392
Yes.

42:38.569 --> 42:41.367
I said the Lord is worthy to be praised,
isn't he?

42:41.539 --> 42:43.837
- Yeah.
- So here's what I'd like to do.

42:44.008 --> 42:46.533
I'd like to take them
just a little bit higher in here.

42:46.711 --> 42:48.008
Yeah!

42:48.179 --> 42:51.671
Come on, now, you understand me.
Can we take them a little bit higher?

42:51.849 --> 42:52.975
Yeah!

42:53.150 --> 42:55.710
Do y'all mind if we lift him up
and take y'all higher?

42:57.254 --> 43:00.451
I don't know what they're doing.
Follow my cues, give them everything.

43:00.624 --> 43:02.558
Give me some of that Sly Stone funk.

43:05.863 --> 43:07.728
One, two, three. Huh!

<i>- And he won't
- And he won't</i>

46:09.880 --> 46:13.111
<i>Let you fall</i>

46:13.617 --> 46:15.847
<i>- He will take you</i>
<i>- Higher</i>

46:16.020 --> 46:17.248
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

46:17.421 --> 46:20.720
<i>- He wants to take you
- Higher</i>

46:20.891 --> 46:23.792
<i>- He will
- He will light your fire</i>

46:23.961 --> 46:25.588
<i>Light your fire</i>

46:25.763 --> 46:27.958
<i>- Don't you wanna go
- Higher</i>

46:28.132 --> 46:29.997
<i>- Higher?
- Higher</i>

46:30.167 --> 46:31.828
<i>Higher</i>

46:35.439 --> 46:38.340
<i>Uh-huh, yeah</i>

46:39.577 --> 46:43.377
<i>Like a fool
I went astray, O Lord</i>

46:43.547 --> 46:46.482
<i>Now I'm wondering
If your love's still strong</i>

46:46.650 --> 46:47.878
Whoo!

46:48.052 --> 46:49.076
<i>- O Lord</i>
<i>- Here I am</i>

46:49.253 --> 46:53.212
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered
I'm yours</i>

46:53.390 --> 46:55.620
<i>Yeah Yeah, yeah</i>

46:55.793 --> 46:58.921
<i>And that time I went and said goodbye</i>

46:59.897 --> 47:03.628
<i>Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry</i>

47:04.068 --> 47:07.299
<i>Oh, no, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

47:07.471 --> 47:10.634
<i>I'm yours, I'm yours</i>

47:10.808 --> 47:12.241
<i>Here I am, Lord</i>

47:12.409 --> 47:14.934
<i>- You know I'm here right now
- Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

47:15.112 --> 47:17.910
<i>- You've got the future in your hands
- I'm yours</i>

47:18.082 --> 47:19.777
<i>- Yeah</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

47:19.950 --> 47:22.043
<i>- Here I am, Lord
- Here I am, Lord</i>

47:22.219 --> 47:24.653
<i>- Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
- Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

47:24.822 --> 47:26.483
<i>I'm yours</i>

47:26.657 --> 47:30.286
<i>He wants to take you higher</i>

47:30.461 --> 47:32.361
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

47:32.529 --> 47:33.894
<i>Higher</i>

47:34.064 --> 47:36.430
<i>- Take me
- I'm yours</i>

47:36.600 --> 47:38.761
<i>- Higher

47:38.936 --> 47:42.372
<i>- Signed, sealed, delivered</i>
<i>- Higher, higher</i>

47:43.607 --> 47:45.939
<i>I'm yours Higher</i>

47:46.110 --> 47:48.908
<i>- Higher, higher, yeah
- Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

47:49.079 --> 47:52.537
<i>- Higher, higher
- Oh, yeah, yeah</i>

47:53.117 --> 47:55.176
<i>- Signed, sealed, delivered
- Come on</i>

47:55.352 --> 47:58.378
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered
Higher</i>

47:58.555 --> 48:01.115
<i>- Oh, yeah
- Higher</i>

48:01.291 --> 48:05.057
<i>Higher
Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

48:05.429 --> 48:08.956
<i>Higher, higher</i>

48:09.133 --> 48:11.624
<i>Boom lakalakalaka
Boom boom boom</i>

48:11.802 --> 48:14.669
<i>Higher, higher</i>

48:14.838 --> 48:16.838
<i>Higher</i>

48:58.248 --> 49:00.307
We did it. We did it.

49:01.585 --> 49:03.519
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Vi Rose.

49:03.687 --> 49:05.678
- Good morning, winners.
- Good morning.

49:07.057 --> 49:08.251
Let me help you with that.

49:08.425 --> 49:10.620
Thank you.
My head's still spinning from last night.

49:12.463 --> 49:14.658
I just wish Bernie
could've been here to see it.

49:14.832 --> 49:17.892
- Oh, I think Bernie was here to see it.
- Mm....

49:20.003 --> 49:23.029
You may have noticed I don't do
particularly well with change.

49:23.207 --> 49:27.541
That's because, in my experience, it mostly
takes a big chunk out of your behind.

49:27.845 --> 49:29.073
But not this time.

49:29.613 --> 49:31.342
And that's due to Randy.

49:31.515 --> 49:34.040
I will never forget what he did for Walter.

49:34.218 --> 49:35.708
- He's a good kid.
- Yeah.

49:35.886 --> 49:38.377
And he didn't just lick it off the ground.
He had you.

49:38.555 --> 49:41.683
And we owe you a lot too.
In fact, we owe you everything.

49:41.859 --> 49:44.020
Don't make a face.

49:44.194 --> 49:47.994
Oh. Look. Look at your daughter.

49:48.165 --> 49:50.827
She's looking at Randy
like I look at cake.

49:51.001 --> 49:53.469
Yeah, the kind that stays in your stomach
for nine months.

50:17.327 --> 50:20.660
You can close your mouth, Mama.
This ain't the first time we kissed.

51:10.581 --> 51:16.144
<i>I see him when the children are playing</i>

51:17.654 --> 51:24.617
<i>I hear him when the church bells ring
On wedding days</i>

51:24.795 --> 51:28.026
<i>- I feel him when the breezes blow
- Ooh, ooh</i>

51:28.198 --> 51:31.463
<i>- Adore him where the flowers grow
- Ooh, ooh</i>

51:31.635 --> 51:34.866
<i>We fear him when the oceans roar</i>

51:35.038 --> 51:38.201
<i>- He's everything
- He's everything</i>

51:48.719 --> 51:51.347
<i>He's everything</i>

51:52.122 --> 51:55.057
<i>We're born, we live, we die</i>

51:55.225 --> 51:57.625
<i>And life goes on</i>

51:59.162 --> 52:06.159
<i>We love, we laugh, we cry
So forth, so on</i>

52:06.436 --> 52:10.236
<i>- And we're a part of his creation
- Ooh, ooh</i>

52:10.407 --> 52:13.376
<i>- Every person, every nation
- Ooh, ooh</i>

52:13.543 --> 52:16.979
<i>- He's in every situation
- He's in every situation</i>

52:17.147 --> 52:19.945
<i>Everything</i>

52:20.117 --> 52:21.584
<i>He's everything</i>

52:21.752 --> 52:23.049
<i>Let's lift him up</i>

52:23.220 --> 52:27.316
<i>Through everything
He's loving us</i>

52:27.491 --> 52:34.488
<i>Is it asking all that much
That we should do the same?</i>

52:35.265 --> 52:39.497
<i>So let us sing and raise our voice</i>

52:39.670 --> 52:44.471
<i>Let us make a joyful noise</i>

52:44.641 --> 52:48.270
<i>- Rejoice
- Rejoice and praise his name</i>

52:48.445 --> 52:49.969
<i>- Rejoice
- Rejoice</i>

52:50.147 --> 52:52.479
<i>- Sing it again
- Oh, rejoice</i>

52:52.649 --> 52:54.776
<i>Rejoice His joy remains</i>

52:54.952 --> 52:58.149
<i>He's everything</i>

53:08.799 --> 53:12.030
<i>He's everything</i>

53:12.369 --> 53:15.566
<i>He's everything</i>

53:15.739 --> 53:19.800
<i>He's everything</i>

53:19.977 --> 53:24.380
<i>Praise his name His holy name</i>

53:24.548 --> 53:31.545
<i>He's everything</i>

53:35.525 --> 53:38.460
<i>He's always loving us</i>

53:38.929 --> 53:41.625
<i>We should show a little love</i>

53:41.798 --> 53:45.825
<i>- In everything, everything</i>
<i>- Everything, everything</i>

53:46.003 --> 53:49.268
<i>He's the God of hope and change</i>

53:49.439 --> 53:52.567
<i>He's the cure for hurt and pain</i>

53:52.743 --> 53:55.211
<i>You know he loves us all the same</i>

53:55.379 --> 53:59.713
<i>- 'Cause he's everything, he's everything</i>
<i>- Everything, everything</i>

53:59.883 --> 54:03.216
<i>In everything, he plays a part</i>

54:03.387 --> 54:06.379
<i>Heals and mends our broken hearts</i>

54:06.556 --> 54:09.184
<i>Restores us when we fall apart</i>

54:09.359 --> 54:12.692
<i>- 'Cause he's everything, he's everything</i>
<i>- Everything, everything</i>

54:13.530 --> 54:16.966
<i>So lift him up, rejoice, rejoice</i>

54:17.134 --> 54:19.898
<i>Let us sing and raise our voice</i>

54:20.070 --> 54:23.597
<i>And let us make a joyful noise</i>

54:23.774 --> 54:26.374
<i>He is everything</i>
