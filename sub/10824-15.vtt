WILL YOU STOP?

39:53.119 --> 39:55.188
OR IS IT BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO TELL ME THAT WYATT

39:55.188 --> 39:56.557
IS RUNNING ALL AROUND TOWN

39:56.557 --> 39:58.458
STOP IT.
CAUSING ALL KINDS OF HELL

39:58.458 --> 40:00.226
AND THAT I SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF MYSELF

40:00.226 --> 40:02.102
STOP IT.
FOR COVERING UP A CRIME?

40:02.102 --> 40:06.306
OR IS IT BECAUSE HANNA WANTS
TO SERVE JIM CRYER A LAWSUIT

40:06.306 --> 40:08.942
STOP IT.
ALL BY HER LITTLE SELF?

40:08.942 --> 40:10.877
STOP.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

40:10.877 --> 40:12.478
HOW MUCH ARE YOU
SUING ME FOR, HANNA?

40:12.478 --> 40:13.880
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE IT ALL?

40:13.880 --> 40:16.717
IS THAT IT? HMM?

40:16.717 --> 40:18.752
ARE YOU DONE?

40:18.752 --> 40:21.487
I'M DONE.
YOUR TURN.

40:21.487 --> 40:24.490
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?

40:24.490 --> 40:27.794
I AM HERE AT THE REQUEST
OF YOUR WIFE

40:27.794 --> 40:32.633
TO TELL YOU THAT
YOUR SON HAS BEEN...

40:32.633 --> 40:34.167
WHAT?

40:34.167 --> 40:36.837
TO TELL ME
MY SON HAS BEEN WHAT?

40:39.472 --> 40:42.008
HE DIED.

40:49.215 --> 40:52.385
WHAT? WHAT?

40:52.385 --> 40:54.655
SHE COULDN'T
TELL YOU HERSELF

40:54.655 --> 40:57.991
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HEAR IT FROM ANYONE ELSE.

41:00.493 --> 41:04.137
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
TO ME, HANNA?

41:07.173 --> 41:09.710
HE O. D.'D.

41:12.145 --> 41:14.480
WHAT?

41:14.480 --> 41:17.017
I'M SORRY, MR. CRYER.

41:27.493 --> 41:30.864
<i>NEXT ON "THE HAVES</i>
<i>AND THE HAVE NOTS"...</i>

41:30.864 --> 41:32.699
THAT'S WHAT FEMININE
LIPS TASTE LIKE.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.434
WELL, I'LL PAY YOU.
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

41:34.434 --> 41:36.537
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.238
I KNOW ‐‐ I KNOW THAT.

41:38.238 --> 41:40.807
I JUST ‐‐
I JUST WANT YOU TO DO...

41:40.807 --> 41:45.679
HANNA. I NEED YOU TO DO
THIS ONE FAVOR FOR ME.

41:45.679 --> 41:47.981
ALL RIGHT, B.
HANG ON FOR A SECOND.

41:47.981 --> 41:50.250
THE MAN'S MESSING
WITH MY MONEY.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.553
IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY
TO GET ME OUT OF THIS

41:52.553 --> 41:55.321
WITH SOME MONEY FOR MY PARENTS,
THEN I WILL TAKE

41:55.321 --> 41:57.490
THAT BITCH OF A MOTHER
OF YOURS DOWN WITH YOU.
