WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.338
Here we go. I'll be
right back with some
Parmesan and red pepper.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.174
And let me know if there's
anything else I can get you.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.676
Just a defibrillator
and a cardiac needle.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.512
I know this restaurant
is a little heavier than
what you guys are used to,

00:11.545 --> 00:14.348
but Shania wanted to go
to an authentic Italian place,

00:14.382 --> 00:16.284
where they serve real
ranch dressing breadsticks,

00:16.317 --> 00:18.252
to make her big
surprise announcement.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.753
That's okay, you know,
I read the other day

00:19.787 --> 00:21.122
that Americans are eating
too many vegetables.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.423
So this is great.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.093
Thank you all for coming.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.660
It is very important to me

00:26.694 --> 00:29.263
that you be the first to
know about my life change.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.498
This boy at my
school, Wilbur--

00:30.531 --> 00:33.367
Mom, you know the one with
the really intense eyes--

00:33.401 --> 00:35.136
he came up to me at recess,
and at first,

00:35.169 --> 00:37.138
I thought he was gonna
throw a red ball at my head--

00:37.171 --> 00:39.740
he's such a flirt--
but instead...

00:39.773 --> 00:41.109
(bell rings)
Shania,

00:41.142 --> 00:42.543
we've been friends
for how long now?

00:42.576 --> 00:45.146
Three, three and a half weeks?

00:45.179 --> 00:46.514
Feels like four.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.549
I don't really understand
how time works.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.119
I got a check minus
on that section,

00:51.152 --> 00:52.753
but I want to spend
my whole life with you.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.555
I know you might have
to go back to the Midwest,

00:54.588 --> 00:57.625
but I can't let you leave
without telling you how I feel.

00:58.559 --> 01:02.296
You make me want
to be a better boy.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.698
Shania,
will you pretend marry me?

01:05.833 --> 01:07.101
I'm getting pretend married.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.537
We're registered at Toys"R"Us.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.772
What is happening?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.541
BRYAN:
He put a ring on it.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.645
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

01:29.423 --> 01:31.725
Shania's pretend wedding
is so romantic.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.162
Hmm.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.434
What?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.803
What are you thinking about?

01:42.836 --> 01:44.405
I can't believe
you've never been here before.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.773
I would've brought you here
like, three dates ago.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.808
Isn't it fun being with
all the beautiful people?

01:47.841 --> 01:49.143
I only see one.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.347
Oh, my God,
it's Ben Affleck and J.Lo.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.682
I predict
they're gonna get married

01:54.715 --> 01:56.817
and have beautiful,
soy latte-complexioned babies.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.788
Is that Madonna
and Guy Ritchie?

02:00.821 --> 02:03.257
Oh, my God, I've been
reading People magazine because
of you.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.393
I'm so proud of you.
It's where I get all of my news.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.660
They're like,
the perfect couple.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.128
Till death do they part.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.697
No, I read that
Madonna can't die.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.098
She had that procedure done.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.366
Oh, yeah. I want
to get married someday

02:12.400 --> 02:14.168
and live happily ever after,
don't you?

02:14.202 --> 02:16.237
Sure, I also want to be
a seven-foot-tall center

02:16.270 --> 02:18.239
for the Chicago Bulls,
but that's not gonna happen.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.874
I don't know what that means.
Marriage for guys like us,
it's a fantasy.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.843
Gay people can have fabulous
commitment ceremonies,

02:22.876 --> 02:24.512
but until it's sanctioned

02:24.545 --> 02:26.113
by the U.S. government,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.249
it's nothing more
than just playing house.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.617
Yeah, but the emotions are real.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.619
I mean, it's still
a declaration of love.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.822
Until every single
consenting adult in this country

02:34.855 --> 02:36.657
can marry whomever they choose,

02:36.690 --> 02:39.693
I refuse to even
consider getting married.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.128
That's so unromantic.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.597
But so political
and Harvey Milk hot.

02:43.631 --> 02:46.600
Um, okay,
so marriage is off the table.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.802
What about kids?

02:48.836 --> 02:51.339
That, I'd be interested in...

02:51.372 --> 02:53.274
with the right guy.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.776
Bryan, what are you
thinking about?

02:57.311 --> 02:59.179
Nothing.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.920
Bumblebee, it's almost 9:00.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.656
Helmet lights out.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.924
You should be sleeping,
not mining for coal.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.460
Sorry, Mom.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.528
I just had to finish
sketching my wedding dress.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.665
I was thinking it could be
made out of autumn leaves,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.433
symbolizing Wilbur's and my
willingness

03:19.467 --> 03:21.935
to grow and change with
life's tempestuous seasons.

03:21.969 --> 03:25.406
Plus, they make a
funny crunch sound.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.775
Honey, having a pretend wedding
is kind of a big deal.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.811
You sure Wilbur's ready
to be a one-girl boy?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.713
Mom, I'm not you
and Wilbur's not Dad.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.947
We love each other.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.549
Don't you remember
how you felt

03:35.583 --> 03:37.418
when you first got engaged?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.453
Hit a turkey, baby.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.962
If I throw a strike,
will you marry me, baby?

03:49.630 --> 03:50.764
No, I'm serious.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.433
My belly is as big
as that bowling ball.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.534
Is that why you're asking?

03:53.567 --> 03:54.668
You know,
'cause you have to?

03:54.702 --> 03:55.703
Yes.
Oh.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.405
Yes, 'cause I have

03:57.438 --> 03:59.707
to be with you every
single day of my life.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.543
Always and forever, with or
without this baby we made.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.979
I love you, Goldie, and I
want you to be my wife.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.581
I love you, too.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.567
Yes.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.002
Yes, I'll marry you,
for better or worse.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.940
You know what, baby,
you're right.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.408
You can't stop love.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.776
So you'll make my dress?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.478
If you promise me one thing:

04:37.511 --> 04:39.547
no sex until you're at least 25.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.649
I couldn't possibly earn
a doctorate until then.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.417
Plus Wilbur and I talked

04:43.451 --> 04:45.586
about living in the French wine
country for at least a year

04:45.619 --> 04:46.854
before even discussing kids.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.359
Get some sleep.

04:54.362 --> 04:58.298
(sighs)
Love is the most wonderful
feeling of them all.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.867
Ooh.
Ooh.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.303
Hamachi tartare
on crisped wonton,

05:03.337 --> 05:04.572
chipotle marinated
flank steak,

05:04.605 --> 05:05.839
and my favorite,
the lamb slider.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.375
Now, the lamb might get
a little breathy,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.343
but we can have a mint amuse
bouche on hand if need be.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.511
Got it.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.312
My dad can't afford
a new leg.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.714
These all look so foreign.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.549
Were you up all night
making them, Rocky?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.385
No, but I was up
all night hating my life.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.686
Okay, so I've ordered
the gardenias,

05:18.719 --> 05:19.953
I sent out the invitations.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.322
Now, Goldie, where are we
with the dress?

05:22.356 --> 05:23.691
Uh, I think I'll just
make her something myself.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.958
Okay, so we're gonna need
a dress.

05:24.992 --> 05:25.993
What's going on?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.695
We're planning
my wedding.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.531
I thought it was
a pretend wedding.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.833
It is, but it's
a real pretend wedding.

05:32.866 --> 05:33.701
Duh, David.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.436
You take that crazy baton.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.871
I am going to go have a drink.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.339
Bryan,
Mmm-hmm?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.741
can I talk to you
for a second?
Yes.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.776
Let me know if that's too chewy.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.579
A wedding?

05:45.613 --> 05:46.947
A real wedding?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.716
With flowers and food
and a dress?

05:48.749 --> 05:51.318
I'm surprised you didn't hire
a monkey to be the ring bearer.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.721
I tried, but the only one in
town is booked on some TV show.

05:53.754 --> 05:57.090
Bryan, Shania is a nine-year-old
girl with a crush.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.827
If she wanted a fantasy
playground wedding, I get it.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.829
But not everybody
wants what you want.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.797
This is becoming
the social event of the season.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.065
Oh, from your lips.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.868
Question: do the Kardashians
have any school-age children?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.438
(doorbell rings)

06:10.471 --> 06:13.874
Can someone please explain
to me what the hell this is?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.376
Oh, yeah, that's Shania's
wedding invitation.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.978
We wanted to do a customized
presentation box,

06:18.011 --> 06:19.413
but there just wasn't
enough time.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.114
And we couldn't agree
on a ribbon.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.983
Why are you doing
this to Shania?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.885
Oh, Nana, it's just
a pretend wedding.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.921
No, see,
that's what these gays do.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.490
They "pretend"

06:29.523 --> 06:31.124
you can define
what marriage is.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.593
Today it's two children.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.428
Tomorrow,
it's the banana polishers.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.563
Next thing you know,
they're gonna have

06:35.596 --> 06:36.797
a wedding for their dog.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.398
Actually, we had a
commitment ceremony

06:38.432 --> 06:39.767
for Smelly and Mabel,
the Schuler's boxer,

06:39.800 --> 06:42.102
last spring, and that beef
bouillon fountain went over big.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.403
(whispers):
Not helping.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.573
Marriage is not for dogs,

06:45.606 --> 06:47.107
it is not for children,

06:47.140 --> 06:50.110
and I'm sorry, boys,
but it is not for you.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.446
Mrs. Forrest, there was a
time not too long ago,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.682
when it was illegal for black
people to marry white people.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.849
Kept things organized.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.984
When the state of California

06:57.017 --> 06:58.418
finally makes gay
marriage legal,

06:58.452 --> 07:01.121
my partner and I will be
getting married, right, David?

07:01.154 --> 07:04.024
Right?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.595
I don't know.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.997
Aw, Cinderfella.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.866
Looks like that glass slipper
doesn't fit.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.636
And this sham wedding
isn't happening, either.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.407
Bryan, Willow Smith just RSVP'd.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.875
It's gonna be a no.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.879
Well, this is the
worst day ever.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.053
Okay,
I have personally handpicked

07:33.086 --> 07:34.688
each and every one of you girls

07:34.722 --> 07:37.190
because I've seen the Romney
sticker on your parents' car.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.892
That,
and you know how to sit

07:38.926 --> 07:40.494
with your legs together.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.663
We have ourselves
a very big problem, ladies,

07:42.696 --> 07:46.634
and I need the help of every one
of you future One Million Moms.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.769
Now, I'm sure you've heard
your parents speak to you

07:48.802 --> 07:51.204
about the sanctity of marriage.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.806
Sure, marriage is between
Adam and Eve,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.042
not Adam and Steve.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.810
That is very good, Reagan.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.946
Gay marriage is currently legal

07:58.979 --> 08:00.147
in six states.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.182
My mom says that's six too many.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.217
We have a freezer in our garage

08:04.251 --> 08:05.886
filled with ziplock bags
of our blood

08:05.919 --> 08:08.021
in case we ever need
a transfusion.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.023
We don't want gay blood.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.092
My uncle was gay,
but we cured him.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.061
Now he's a youth pastor.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.096
Now, we need to stop
this wedding nonsense

08:16.129 --> 08:17.931
between Shania and Wilbur.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.067
But it's a pretend
wedding, just for fun.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.670
Fun? Marriage isn't supposed
to be fun.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.774
Marriage is a sacred vow
taken between a heterosexual man

08:26.807 --> 08:29.577
and a woman, preferably
over the age of 18,

08:29.610 --> 08:32.179
to stay together
until death us do part.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.714
And do you know why?

08:34.548 --> 08:35.716
So you can have somebody

08:35.749 --> 08:37.250
to find your body when you die.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.052
You don't want to be
that weird smell

08:39.086 --> 08:41.555
coming out of an apartment
full of cats, do you?

08:43.824 --> 08:45.659
Hello, welcome.
Guests of the pretend groom

08:45.693 --> 08:47.695
to the right, the
pretend bride to the lef...

08:47.728 --> 08:49.663
Wait a minute, booger man,
you're gonna need

08:49.697 --> 08:51.799
to take that thing out of
that nose, you understand?

08:51.832 --> 08:53.801
Ew. Hey! How are you?

08:53.834 --> 08:56.036
Hey, cute poncho, welcome.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.237
SHANIA:
Ready?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.672
Bring it on out here.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.840
Let's see the magic.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.245
What do you think?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.116
I can't believe your mother
made you that beautiful dress.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.085
I love it. I'm not
even lying this time.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.554
My mom's good at lots of things.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.556
Well, all eyes
are going to be on you.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.926
You and the
build-your-own-sundae bar.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.028
Now what about vows?
Did you like that
Neruda poem I sent you?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.162
I think it would
be really brave

09:22.195 --> 09:24.031
if you attempted
his original Spanish.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.166
Think I'm just going to wing it.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.668
That never works.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.836
But great.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.137
Bryan, there aren't
a lot of people

09:30.170 --> 09:31.939
who'd take this
as seriously as you.

09:31.972 --> 09:32.973
So, thanks.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.943
You're crushing the leaves.
Okay.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.211
Shall we?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.947
We shall.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.186
Goldie?
Oh.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.821
Clint, hey.

09:47.855 --> 09:48.922
What are you doing here?

09:48.956 --> 09:49.990
Rocky called me.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.959
Said she needed
someone to officiate

09:51.992 --> 09:54.061
a ridiculous waste
of time and money.

09:54.094 --> 09:54.928
You're a minister?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.797
No, I'm an E.M.T.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.132
But do you need a real minister
to do a fake kids' wedding?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.701
Oh, right.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.770
I just said yes
so I could see you.

10:02.803 --> 10:06.006
Hey, I'm sorry
I never called you back.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.275
It's just, I've been dealing
with a lot of stuff lately,

10:08.308 --> 10:10.678
and I'm not ready
to go on dates just yet.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.045
Wait.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.213
It was for a date, right?

10:13.246 --> 10:16.149
Yes.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.318
It was definitely a date.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.653
Ooh.

10:19.687 --> 10:22.089
Cheers.
(giggles)

10:22.122 --> 10:24.692
Okay, Wilbur, how's that?

10:24.725 --> 10:25.959
It feels tight.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.260
Oh, here, loosen it up.
Like a noose.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.929
I can't breathe.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.964
And I'm hot.
God, is it hot?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.065
Okay, all right...

10:32.099 --> 10:33.366
What the hell am I doing here?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.235
Relax, buddy.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.804
There's no reason
to be nervous.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.872
I'm ten, dude,
and I'm about

10:38.906 --> 10:40.007
to lock this down
with Shania.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.241
Like, forever.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.843
How could I not be nervous?

10:42.876 --> 10:44.812
Because none of this is real.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.814
You're not signing anything,

10:46.847 --> 10:48.615
you don't have any
legal obligations,

10:48.648 --> 10:51.318
it doesn't affect your
taxes or anything.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.853
It's just pretend.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.355
So just smile
and say "I do."

10:55.388 --> 10:57.390
It doesn't mean anything
in the real world.

10:57.424 --> 11:01.228
Yeah, you're right.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.262
Thanks, man.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.363
Pound it.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.965
You're the best.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.234
(chuckles)

11:07.267 --> 11:09.903
Hey.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.371
I guess you heard that stuff.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.874
It is what it is.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.909
That's how you feel.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.716
Hi, everyone, and welcome.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.352
We are gathered here today
to join Shania and Wilbur

11:25.385 --> 11:27.154
in holy pretend matrimony.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.156
Why am I even
watching this?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.091
I feel like
my eyes are bleeding.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.693
Like there's actually blood
seeping from my eyes.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.062
Oh, Nana,
will you stop?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.263
This is important
to Shania.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.965
I'm tired of you
being so unsupportive.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.667
And now, Shania has requested

11:40.700 --> 11:42.970
a spoken word reading
of her favorite poet.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.304
(clears throat)

11:44.337 --> 11:45.873
(applause)

11:46.974 --> 11:49.977
"Right Thru Me" by Nicki Minaj.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.780
"You let me win,
you let me ride

11:52.813 --> 11:55.248
"You let me rock,
you let me slide

11:55.282 --> 11:57.417
"And when you looking,
you let me hide

11:57.450 --> 12:00.387
"Defend my honor,
protect my pride

12:00.420 --> 12:02.923
"The good advice,
I've always hated

12:02.956 --> 12:05.458
"But looking back,
it made me greater

12:05.492 --> 12:08.061
"You always told me,
forget the haters

12:08.095 --> 12:10.998
Just get my money,
just get my weight up."

12:11.031 --> 12:13.700
Honey, I love Nicki Minaj.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.235
(applause)

12:15.268 --> 12:17.370
Come on, you don't think
this is a little ridiculous?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.738
Look, at their
pretend divorce,

12:18.772 --> 12:20.707
you can sit in the pretend
courtroom and gloat.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.075
But just--
until then, just shush.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.010
Thank you, Rocky.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.044
And, everyone,

12:24.077 --> 12:26.146
please welcome
our pretend bride.

12:26.179 --> 12:30.017
(piano playing "Bridal Chorus")

12:33.153 --> 12:37.825
Now, I think, Shania, you have
something you wanted to share?

12:37.858 --> 12:40.427
All my life, I've always known
I was different.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.262
I like to read
instruction manuals.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.131
I put sour cream on everything.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.899
There's no prescription
in these glasses.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.968
Other kids always thought
that was weird,

12:48.001 --> 12:50.070
so I never made
a lot of friends.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.872
It made me feel alone.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.206
Then I met Wilbur.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.142
And he liked
all that stuff about me.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.811
He made me feel like
it was okay to be who I am.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.213
When I'm with Wilbur,
there's no room to feel weird,

13:00.247 --> 13:03.116
because all I feel is love.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.251
(crowd aahing)

13:04.284 --> 13:05.986
(applause)

13:06.019 --> 13:07.787
That's why I want to
pretend marry you.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.122
Because when you find
someone who gets you

13:09.156 --> 13:10.390
for who you are, you want to be

13:10.423 --> 13:12.392
with that person
no matter what anyone else

13:12.425 --> 13:14.127
has to say about it.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.129
Wilbur, you have something
you want to share?

13:16.163 --> 13:19.299
Um, Shania, I love you a lot,

13:19.332 --> 13:22.302
and... I have
a piano lesson at 4:00,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.237
so I need to leave by 3:30.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.339
(laughs)

13:26.373 --> 13:27.875
Now, if there's anyone
who knows any reason

13:27.908 --> 13:29.910
why these two should not be
joined in pretend matrimony,

13:29.943 --> 13:32.379
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.947
Wilbur's a liar!
(crowd gasping)

13:33.981 --> 13:35.082
He doesn't love Shania.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.149
He loves me!

13:36.183 --> 13:38.118
I've been
pretend engaged

13:38.151 --> 13:39.819
to Wilbur since third grade.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.989
We're just waiting till I can
ride my bicycle in the street,

13:42.022 --> 13:43.056
and then we're
out of here.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.124
He kissed me!

13:44.157 --> 13:45.258
Yesterday.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.927
I wasn't going to say anything,

13:46.960 --> 13:48.862
but Shania's nana said
if I didn't, I'd burn in hell.

13:48.896 --> 13:49.997
Ow!

13:50.030 --> 13:51.264
What is happening
right now?

13:51.298 --> 13:52.265
What did you do?

13:52.299 --> 13:53.867
Sorry, baby.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.136
If I could change for anyone,
it'd be you.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.404
But it's like they say:

13:57.437 --> 13:59.272
you can take the player
out of the game,

13:59.306 --> 14:01.308
but you can't take the game
out of the player.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.011
I loved you.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.845
Everyone, thank you for coming.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.881
Please help yourself
to the sundae bar.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.316
(crowd aahing)
Sweetie, no, no, no.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.019
How could you?

14:12.052 --> 14:13.486
Oh, stop your blubbering.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.089
You know what, you get out
of here before I cut your hair!

14:16.123 --> 14:17.324
He's not worth it.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.061
Shame, huh?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.429
They seemed so good together.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.403
Here, eat your feelings.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.140
Rocky, did you call Disney World

14:33.173 --> 14:34.474
and cancel
the pretend honeymoon?

14:34.507 --> 14:36.309
Bryan, cheer up.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.011
This actually was
a nice event.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.879
There's not a
lamb slider left.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.248
I ate every damn one.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.583
You know it's gonna backfire
on me later, don't you?

14:46.119 --> 14:47.921
It was a very sweet gesture.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.056
People had fun.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.123
No, David.
You were right.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.158
This was a waste of time.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.993
Are you happy?

14:53.026 --> 14:54.394
Shania's in there
absolutely heartbroken.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.528
Shania's like her nana--

14:55.562 --> 14:57.264
she's tough, she'll get over it.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.599
The important thing is

14:59.632 --> 15:01.268
that the next time she tries
to take a dump on marriage,

15:01.301 --> 15:02.535
she'll think twice.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.337
It wasn't a real wedding.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.874
It was about a little girl
wanting to believe in something.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.476
I want her to believe
in something,

15:09.509 --> 15:11.278
like that marriage is sacred.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.445
Do you have any idea

15:12.479 --> 15:14.547
what kind of role models
your daughter has?

15:14.581 --> 15:18.885
I get it, you don't respect
David and Bryan's relationship.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.153
No.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.589
It's you and me.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.425
Both of our marriages
completely tanked.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.327
And your mother
didn't even bother.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.362
And now you've got her
here with these two

15:29.396 --> 15:32.599
parading around, playing house,
writing their own rules,

15:32.632 --> 15:35.168
defying laws of science
and morality.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.336
With role models like this,

15:36.369 --> 15:39.406
things can only go
one way for Shania,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.608
and you think
I'm trying to hurt her?

15:41.641 --> 15:43.943
I am trying to protect her.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.178
That's great, Nana.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.680
But I need to protect
her from you.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.116
Go home.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.217
Fine.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.684
I will go back
to my hotel.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.020
I would rather

15:53.053 --> 15:54.154
pay for my booze

15:54.187 --> 15:57.157
than drink Champale out of
a size-12 ballet slipper.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.626
No, not to your hotel.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.461
Go home, Nana.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.430
Pack your bag, get on a plane,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.298
and go back to Ohio for good.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.168
Do you think I would just
walk out on my family?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.702
I'm not your mother.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.404
I am never walking away.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.706
I love you. I love Shania.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.609
You know, since the day you
were born on that porch,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.178
I have done nothing

16:18.211 --> 16:20.147
but put your needs
ahead of my own,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.349
and then your daughter's,

16:22.382 --> 16:24.417
and this is the thanks I get.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.190
Lamb sliders are gay.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.424
I'm going to have

16:31.458 --> 16:34.161
a hearty meal
at the Chick-fil-A.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.562
Oh, I want to go.
I miss Chick-fil-A.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.563
Uh-uh.
No.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.265
Oh, okay. Calm down.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.243
Hey, sweetie.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.744
Can I come lie with you?

16:51.778 --> 16:54.214
Sure, just don't shower me
with sunshine.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.783
I'm not ready for my melancholy
to leak out just yet.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.158
I'm sorry your
heart hurts,

17:05.192 --> 17:07.060
but the next time
love comes knocking,

17:07.094 --> 17:09.096
don't be afraid
to open the door, okay?

17:09.129 --> 17:10.697
Mom, did you let me
have that fake wedding

17:10.730 --> 17:12.199
so I'd learn a
lesson from it?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.333
No.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.202
But why didn't
I think of that?

17:15.235 --> 17:17.104
You're so much wiser
than your years, monkey.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.638
I get that from you.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.640
Actually, I get lots of
good things from you.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.509
I know you're always
looking out for me.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.011
Makes it so I'm not
afraid to fail,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.046
even at stuff that
seems a little weird,

17:27.080 --> 17:28.348
like pretend weddings.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.649
Or like the time
you wanted to start

17:29.682 --> 17:31.218
your own line of
deep-fried jewelry?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.419
I still think
there's something

17:32.452 --> 17:34.487
in that whole "stylish
and delicious" area.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.326
Do you know how lucky
I am that you're mine?

17:39.359 --> 17:40.727
You're the
greatest mom ever

17:40.760 --> 17:42.595
'cause you set
the best example...

17:42.629 --> 17:43.596
Oh, thank you, baby.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.233
...of what not to do.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.700
I'm not going to have
sex or get pregnant,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.469
and I'm definitely
gonna go to college

17:49.502 --> 17:52.739
and someday become the most
venerated volcanologist ever.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.374
That's just a placeholder.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.675
Dreams can change.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.145
Just make sure
you never stop dreaming.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.780
Okay, I'm going to leave you
with your melancholy.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.518
(sighing)

18:05.552 --> 18:08.521
Why, Wilbur? Why?

18:08.555 --> 18:09.622
ANNOUNCER:
Disaster is still looming...

18:09.656 --> 18:11.224
(door opens, closes)

18:11.258 --> 18:14.261
I was calling you all day.
You could have picked up.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.395
I was too depressed to answer.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.397
Even after her
extreme weight loss,

18:17.430 --> 18:19.466
Teresa still thinks she looks
huge in all those dresses.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.334
Why can't Teresa
forget about her past?

18:21.368 --> 18:23.470
Why can't Teresa just have
her day in the sun?

18:23.503 --> 18:25.272
Get up. We're going
for Chinese food.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.573
I have to see how this ends.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.408
Spoiler: Teresa says
yes to the dress.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.842
David, don't be glib!

18:29.876 --> 18:31.744
They don't always find
the dress they're looking for.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.513
BRYAN: Why are we here?
You promised me dumplings.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.614
There's something
I have to do.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.848
It'll only take a minute.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.550
I don't like being in
your office after dark.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.818
It feels like there are ghosts.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.487
Ghosts of patients who couldn't
understand their co-pay

18:40.520 --> 18:42.489
and died talking to
their insurance company.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.624
Hi, Bryan.
Pretend like I'm not here.

18:44.657 --> 18:48.127
There's something
I want to ask you,

18:48.161 --> 18:50.297
and I could only
do it like this.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.432
David, stop it.
What's going on?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.800
Just give me a minute.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.472
You doing okay?

18:59.506 --> 19:00.640
Yeah, I'm great.
You do you.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.777
(rhythmic heartbeat)
There.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.778
Hold it right there.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.348
Steady.
Oh, David.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.551
David, look, You can see his
or her tiny, little fingers.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.825
What are you doing?
Is it my birthday.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.561
I wanted to do it like this,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.530
in front of our baby,

19:23.563 --> 19:28.535
so that one day, he or she
could say, "I was there."

19:29.802 --> 19:33.306
"I was there
when my daddies got engaged."

19:34.674 --> 19:39.379
There was this, uh, moment
at Shania's fake wedding

19:39.412 --> 19:41.348
when I looked over at you,

19:41.381 --> 19:43.916
and the tears
in your eyes were real.

19:43.950 --> 19:48.388
I always knew how important
getting married was to you,

19:48.421 --> 19:51.891
but it wasn't until that moment
that I truly understood

19:51.924 --> 19:53.626
what commitment meant.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.628
We're having a baby, Bry.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.896
(nervous chuckling)

19:56.929 --> 19:59.299
This is our family.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.668
You, me,

20:01.701 --> 20:04.437
and that kid.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.805
Forever.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.942
Family is the ultimate
commitment.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.246
Getting married,
it just seems...

20:13.280 --> 20:15.248
I don't know, easy.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.816
But you don't believe in it.

20:16.849 --> 20:18.518
But you do,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.653
and I believe in us.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.392
Oh.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.297
Bryan Collins...

20:30.330 --> 20:32.499
Oh, my God, it's happening.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.801
...will you do me the honor

20:34.834 --> 20:37.437
of being my husband?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.472
Yes.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.286
Shania, honey, I know
you're disappointed

20:53.320 --> 20:54.387
that the wedding
didn't happen,

20:54.421 --> 20:55.622
but you know when I'm sad,

20:55.655 --> 20:56.823
I like to do something
called "eat my feelings,"

20:56.856 --> 20:57.957
and I'd like to share
it with you right now.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.659
What's that?
Well, when you feel sad,

20:59.692 --> 21:02.028
you just eat stuff until
you're not sad anymore.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.467
(muffled):
It's really healing. Try it.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.738
Yeah, really get in there.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.807
I mean, who needs boys
when you can have sugar?

21:14.841 --> 21:17.444
You know?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.612
He wasn't that great anyway.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.747
It's okay, honey.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.914
Just keep eating.
