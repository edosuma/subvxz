00:56.133 --> 00:58.266
-Hi, Sophia.
-Hi, Rose.

00:58.333 --> 01:02.233
-You're all dressed up. Where you going?
-The President's in town.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.200
We're going to see his wife.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.867
I loved her in<i> Father Knows Best.</i>

01:09.834 --> 01:12.433
Sophia, you're a little confused.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.934
That was Jane Wyatt.
The president was married to Jane Wyman.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That old crow from <i>Falcon Crest?</i>

01:19.266 --> 01:23.300
They're not married anymore.
Now he's married to Nancy Davis.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.900
-From <i>All About Eve?</i>
-That's Bette Davis.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.166
The one who beat her kids
with wire hangers?

01:29.734 --> 01:33.500
-That was Joan Crawford.
-The fat cop from <i>Highway Patrol?</i>

01:34.633 --> 01:36.100
That was Broderick Crawford.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.767
The president was married
to Broderick Crawford...

01:39.800 --> 01:42.066
and Mondale still lost?
What an idiot.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.133
-Girls, how does this dress look?
-What's the difference?

01:46.200 --> 01:50.033
Soon it'll be on the floor
next to an empty bottle of Jack Daniels.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.133
Blanche, here's a question.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.000
-Who's the president married to?
-Nancy Reagan.

01:57.066 --> 01:59.934
The thin one he helps
out of the helicopter.

02:01.166 --> 02:03.367
This idiot thinks
he's married to Broderick Crawford.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.600
Get some help, Rose.

02:08.700 --> 02:12.367
-Blanche, that outfit sure is risqué.
-Thank you.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.967
Would you just check my clasp?

02:15.033 --> 02:17.900
I need those earrings
you borrowed last week.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.934
-I put those in your room.
-Oh, no, not again.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.400
-I didn't lose them.
-You're always losing everything,

02:25.467 --> 02:30.200
tickets to the Julio Iglesias concert,
two sets of house keys.

02:30.266 --> 02:33.066
You needed help finding your car
at the airport.

02:33.133 --> 02:36.300
I didn't lose those earrings.
I'll find them.

02:36.367 --> 02:40.867
-Hurry. I'm due there by 6:00.
-There's plenty of time. It's only...

02:43.500 --> 02:47.266
Dorothy, could I borrow... sorry.
I forgot about your tutoring session.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.867
We were just finishing.

02:48.934 --> 02:52.467
-Hi, Blanche. You look pretty.
-You should see me if I had earrings.

02:54.700 --> 02:57.166
-So, what are y'all doing?
-We just finished algebra.

02:57.233 --> 03:00.567
-Why am I learning algebra?
-Because I had to learn to teach it.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.433
Now I'm checking the grammar
in Mario's story.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.700
-This is really terrific.
-Not terrific. It's just ok.

03:09.767 --> 03:13.266
It's much better than ok. Blanche, listen.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.266
Don't read it. You'll embarrass me.

03:15.834 --> 03:19.200
All right.
I'll just read it from there to there.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.800
You'll miss the spirit of the whole piece.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.433
Take it from here.

03:25.967 --> 03:30.033
"The very first night he was in America,
his uncle took him to a movie.

03:30.100 --> 03:35.600
He felt excited watching it
because of the feeling he got

03:35.667 --> 03:39.867
sitting in that theater with those other
people, laughing together,

03:39.934 --> 03:41.467
getting scared together.

03:41.533 --> 03:44.133
He felt they were his friends.

03:44.200 --> 03:48.600
To him, that feeling was the feeling
of living in America.

03:48.667 --> 03:53.667
In America, you always felt
like you were among friends."

03:54.200 --> 03:55.800
Mario, that's just beautiful.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.400
You should hear me read it.

03:58.667 --> 04:02.200
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi, Mario. How about a snack?

04:02.266 --> 04:03.667
Sure. I'm starving.

04:03.734 --> 04:06.633
How about a herring sandwich
on raisin bread?

04:07.834 --> 04:09.934
Oh, wow. I'm going to miss my bus.

04:10.734 --> 04:14.166
That bus doesn't leave till...
see you tomorrow.

04:14.233 --> 04:18.233
-Bye, Rose, Blanche. <i>Adios</i>, teach.
<i>-Hasta mañana.</i>

04:23.233 --> 04:26.633
Maybe I should submit his story
in the district contest.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.066
I think you should.
He's very special, Dorothy.

04:30.133 --> 04:32.500
He really is.
I'm just crazy about him.

04:32.567 --> 04:35.233
He wants so much to learn.

04:35.300 --> 04:38.433
He gets this look in his eyes
when he's listening to me.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.233
You don't see that look very often.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.500
That look is the reason
teachers teach.

04:45.033 --> 04:48.633
There's a similar look that means
I'm going to slash your tires...

04:50.400 --> 04:53.033
but an experienced teacher
can tell the difference.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.834
I'm going to a party.
Can I borrow your silver earrings?

04:57.900 --> 05:01.033
Why not wear the ones
you usually wear?

05:01.533 --> 05:03.200
Would you like to field that one, Rose?

05:05.400 --> 05:09.400
Blanche, I have looked all over the house.
I cannot find your earrings.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.166
But I found the Julio Iglesias tickets.

05:14.934 --> 05:16.667
Boy, we had great seats.

05:19.266 --> 05:22.867
-Blanche, I think just awful about this.
-Oh, just forget about it, Rose.

05:22.934 --> 05:25.667
I never intended to keep
those earrings my entire life.

05:25.734 --> 05:26.934
Like my mama did.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.367
And my grandmama.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.400
And my great-grandmama,
who fashioned those earrings herself

05:36.467 --> 05:38.967
from the civil war bullets
that killed great-granddaddy.

05:43.266 --> 05:45.900
-I'll make this up to you.
-Forget it, Rose.

05:45.967 --> 05:47.633
No. I've already decided.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.867
For one week, I am going to be your
personal <i>wiedenfrugen.</i>

05:54.100 --> 05:55.900
Can one woman do that for another?

05:58.133 --> 05:59.934
Only if they're the same height.

06:01.133 --> 06:03.533
What the hell is a <i>wiedenfrugen?</i>

06:05.133 --> 06:06.867
<i>Wiedenfrugen.</i>

06:07.266 --> 06:11.700
It's a personal servant.
It's the only way to make up for this.

06:11.767 --> 06:14.100
My family's done it for years...

06:14.500 --> 06:17.800
ever since uncle Ben
lost Lars Olsen's artificial leg.

06:20.700 --> 06:24.033
It was the day
of the big four-county toboggan race.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.900
Lars came in dead last.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.400
Boy, that was a day to remember.

06:30.467 --> 06:36.266
Every American remembers where he was
the day Lars lost that toboggan race.

06:37.133 --> 06:40.900
Uncle Ben felt terrible.
He tried making it up.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.300
Lars said he forgave him,
but there were hard feelings.

06:46.066 --> 06:48.667
Lars kept trying to run Ben down
with his bicycle...

06:50.000 --> 06:52.467
but with only one leg, how fast...

06:52.533 --> 06:54.000
-could he pedal?
-Could he pedal?

06:55.567 --> 06:59.934
Finally, uncle Ben suggested something
to clear the air once and for all.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.200
For one week,
he would be Lars' personal <i>wiedenfrugen</i>

07:04.266 --> 07:07.800
and do whatever Lars wanted.
Lars agreed, and it worked.

07:07.867 --> 07:10.300
I mean, it always works.
Give it a try, Blanche.

07:10.367 --> 07:14.400
All right, I will,
but I'm late for my date.

07:14.467 --> 07:16.800
I'll grab those earrings.

07:16.867 --> 07:20.600
-I'll help her.
-Uh, Rose, listen.

07:21.500 --> 07:25.767
I'm going to ask a question
that I'll hate myself for asking,

07:25.834 --> 07:30.166
but whatever happened
to Lars' missing leg?

07:31.467 --> 07:35.867
Oh, they found it at the annual Edelweiss
and Jarlsberg choral festival.

07:35.934 --> 07:39.533
Uncle Ben used it to fight wolves
while setting up the bleachers.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.633
Just as I suspected.

07:51.266 --> 07:53.967
Now I know why they say
sunbathing is dangerous.

07:54.033 --> 07:58.033
We've only been out here a little while.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.900
At your age, don't worry about wrinkles.

08:01.967 --> 08:03.867
Who's talking about wrinkles?
I can't get up.

08:03.934 --> 08:05.533
My butt's stuck to the chair.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.000
-I'll help you.
-Ooh, I'll do that.

08:10.066 --> 08:13.533
-No, that's all right.
-That's what a personal servant's for.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.533
-I'm uncomfortable having you work for me.
-You want to be my servant?

08:19.066 --> 08:22.433
Blanche, I'm not talking about big things,
I'm talking about little things,

08:22.500 --> 08:24.033
like doing your laundry.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.667
My laundry's more fun.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.100
I'll feel better
about losing your earrings.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.033
Ever see panties from the twenties?

08:31.100 --> 08:32.433
They got pockets.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.033
Please, Blanche.

08:35.367 --> 08:37.266
I just don't feel right.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.900
You don't feel right?
But what about me?

08:40.967 --> 08:44.734
What about the guilt that twists deeper
and deeper inside me,

08:44.800 --> 08:47.867
the tortured days and sleepless nights

08:47.934 --> 08:51.400
spent trying to make up
for what I've done?

08:51.467 --> 08:56.100
Oh, come on, Blanche, don't be so selfish.
Let me be your <i>wiedenfrugen.</i>

08:56.166 --> 08:59.567
-All right, be my <i>wiedenflugen.</i>
<i>-"Frugen."</i>

08:59.934 --> 09:02.200
Girls, girls, terrific news.

09:02.266 --> 09:05.767
Remember that story Mario wrote
that I submitted in the contest?

09:05.834 --> 09:09.867
-It won first place!
-Why, Dorothy, that's wonderful!

09:09.934 --> 09:13.433
Anyway, tomorrow, when he comes over
for his usual lesson,

09:13.500 --> 09:16.700
I'll give him a surprise party
to celebrate.

09:16.767 --> 09:20.533
I think that's a great idea.
I just love surprise parties.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.667
I remember every year on my birthday

09:22.734 --> 09:24.734
George always would
take me to the Country Club.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.834
And every year he would say we're just
going to have a nice, quiet little dinner.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.967
Then we'd walk into the dining room
and the lights would go on,

09:31.033 --> 09:34.834
and our friends, all from the finest
families, would yell "surprise."

09:35.400 --> 09:37.533
And every year I pretend
to be surprised.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.033
It always made George so happy.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.967
Good lord, how could
you fake it every year?

09:43.033 --> 09:46.100
Well, Dorothy, when we were first married
I faked it three times a week.

09:50.133 --> 09:51.934
That always made George happy too.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.400
I've only been to one surprise party.
I'll never forget it.

09:57.467 --> 10:00.367
It was for grandma Nylund's
100th birthday.

10:00.900 --> 10:05.367
She was from a whaling village.
That was the party's theme.

10:06.033 --> 10:09.767
We all dressed as Vikings
with helmets and spears.

10:10.734 --> 10:14.066
We all crowded
into her room over the barn.

10:14.567 --> 10:17.200
She walked in, lit a candle...

10:17.734 --> 10:19.400
and we yelled "surprise!"

10:19.834 --> 10:21.667
She dropped dead right there.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.300
We all thought that was
such a nice way to go.

10:30.533 --> 10:31.533
Dorothy...

10:32.900 --> 10:38.533
-if I live to be 100, make me a promise.
-I promise, no surprise party.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.767
No, promise we'll get our own apartment.
These two make me crazy.

10:43.734 --> 10:48.066
-Better start planning Mario's party.
-Let me plan it for you.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.734
-You don't have to.
-But I want to.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.500
You have enough to do.
There's nothing I like better.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.767
-You're sure?
-There's nothing to it!

10:55.834 --> 10:57.767
Well, fine. Thanks.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.533
-Rose.
-Yes?

11:00.600 --> 11:01.667
Plan a party.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.133
I made it as fast as I could.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.166
I couldn't believe you forgot
the peanut butter vanilla ice cream!

11:17.233 --> 11:20.300
-That's Mario's favorite.
-I was so sure chocolate was his favorite.

11:20.367 --> 11:21.900
That's why I bought it this morning.

11:22.433 --> 11:25.100
My goodness, I think you're right.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.934
Whose favorite is the peanut butter
vanilla?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.934
Oh, it must be mine.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.834
Just put that in the freezer for me, Rose.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.767
<i>Wiedenfrugens. </i>What a lovely idea.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.633
If we'd had them in the old days,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.233
we wouldn't have fought
that disruptive Civil War.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.800
-Has anyone seen today's paper?
-Sophia left it out on the lanai.

11:48.867 --> 11:51.166
Just in time.
Rose, fetch the paper.

11:51.233 --> 11:52.500
Okey-dokey.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.433
You've gotten more comfortable
giving Rose things to do.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.767
Deep down it still saddens me,

11:59.834 --> 12:02.967
but psychologically,
it's important to Rose.

12:03.033 --> 12:05.867
I'm careful about giving her anything
too demeaning.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.867
Should I read it aloud and massage
your feet like this morning?

12:13.900 --> 12:17.333
Be a good little <i>wiedenfrugen,</i>
and keep your mouth shut.

12:18.200 --> 12:22.533
There's an article here
about Mario's winning the contest.

12:23.233 --> 12:26.233
-There's a picture, and I'm in it.
-Well, let's see it!

12:26.300 --> 12:30.600
-I look terrible.
-You always think you look terrible.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.734
Let's see it.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.500
Now, that's ugly.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.934
I think I hear him in the kitchen.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.300
(all) Surprise!

12:52.033 --> 12:54.200
Louder next time.
My heart's still beating.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.166
We thought you were Mario.

12:57.233 --> 12:59.300
You'll have to scream louder to kill him.

13:00.834 --> 13:06.800
-Hi, everybody. What's going on?
-Mario, you spoiled our surprise.

13:06.867 --> 13:09.600
Sorry. I'll come in again,
totally unsuspecting.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.900
Here I come, expecting nothing.

13:13.734 --> 13:18.300
-(all) surprise!
-This is great! What a surprise!

13:18.934 --> 13:20.033
But it's not my birthday.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.033
We're celebrating your winning
that contest!

13:23.100 --> 13:27.400
-Oh, wow. Thank you.
-We're so very, very proud of you.

13:27.467 --> 13:31.166
Dorothy says Barbara Thomas
was proud of you, too.

13:32.266 --> 13:34.467
(doorbell chimes)

13:38.400 --> 13:39.934
-Yes?
-Dorothy Zbornak?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.800
-Yes.
-I'm Burt Nesbitt.

13:41.867 --> 13:44.600
I'm looking for Mario Sanchez.
School said he might be here.

13:44.667 --> 13:45.900
Yes, he...

13:45.967 --> 13:46.967
is something wrong?

13:47.033 --> 13:49.800
I'm with the immigration
and naturalization service.

13:49.867 --> 13:52.333
We believe Mario's here illegally.

13:52.867 --> 13:55.033
Mario? You'd better come with me.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.300
Oh, I can't sleep.

14:10.133 --> 14:14.000
I keep lying there
thinking about that look on Mario's face

14:14.066 --> 14:15.934
when he heard that he might be deported.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.100
Might be, Dorothy, not will be.

14:18.166 --> 14:21.834
-Maybe they'll let him stay.
-It's all my fault.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.000
I probably got him
kicked out of the country.

14:24.066 --> 14:27.266
You can't blame yourself.

14:27.333 --> 14:32.033
-Have trust in the justice system.
-That's easy for you to say.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.266
-You're not responsible.
-I know just how Dorothy feels.

14:37.333 --> 14:38.567
When I was young,

14:38.633 --> 14:41.467
I witnessed a horse theft
on granddaddy's plantation.

14:41.533 --> 14:44.900
I screamed, my granddaddy
jumped on his stallion

14:44.967 --> 14:46.567
and rode that horse thief down.

14:46.633 --> 14:48.867
To teach me about the justice system,

14:48.934 --> 14:51.100
granddaddy dragged
that horse thief into court.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.100
With me as the star witness.

14:53.166 --> 14:56.834
I had to testify in front
of a packed courtroom.

14:57.233 --> 14:58.834
You must've been terrified.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.867
I was. I didn't know what to wear.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.767
I only had two dresses with me.

15:06.834 --> 15:10.066
One bright one,
for weddings or a cotillion,

15:10.133 --> 15:13.333
and one darker,
suitable for funerals or a hanging.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.533
My folks were poor.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.800
I had a reversible
hanging cotillion dress.

15:21.967 --> 15:23.834
Well, I picked the bright one.

15:24.233 --> 15:27.500
When I took the stand,
a hush fell over that courtroom.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.100
I told the judge exactly what I'd seen.

15:30.166 --> 15:35.800
After that, that horse thief's fate
was sealed. Justice won the day.

15:37.166 --> 15:40.567
What's that have to do with this?

15:40.633 --> 15:44.200
Like any good story,
mine was deliberately ambiguous,

15:44.266 --> 15:48.033
affording the listener the opportunity
to glean from it whatever he may.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.033
Besides, I hate being left out
of the conversation.

15:54.734 --> 15:57.133
(telephone rings)

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Hello.

16:00.433 --> 16:01.433
Yes, it is.

16:01.867 --> 16:02.867
No, he isn't.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.934
What? What?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.233
Oh...oh, my God.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.333
-Yes, all right. All right.
-What is it?

16:11.400 --> 16:15.333
-Mario's uncle. Mario's run away.
-Oh, no. Where would he go?

16:15.400 --> 16:20.133
-Only one place. I'm going.
-We'll go with you.

16:25.533 --> 16:29.567
(movie playing)

16:29.633 --> 16:31.233
I can't see a thing.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.967
What kind movie is this, Dorothy?

16:34.033 --> 16:36.834
-Rip his throat out!
-It's a musical, Rose.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.400
I think that's Mario sitting
way down there in the front.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.467
-You girls stay here.
-Okay.

16:46.967 --> 16:49.433
-I just hate violent movies.
-Shh.

16:50.133 --> 16:52.734
-It's like watching an autopsy.
-Shh.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.467
Is this seat taken?

17:02.600 --> 17:05.667
Did I miss the part
where he rips the guy's throat out?

17:08.367 --> 17:10.367
Look, I know you've seen
this movie six times,

17:10.433 --> 17:13.100
so you shouldn't mind
answering some questions.

17:13.900 --> 17:18.100
Have you decided to run away,
instead of going to see that judge?

17:20.800 --> 17:23.800
Well, I can't make you change your mind.

17:24.433 --> 17:27.100
I can't even make you put an "r"
in February...

17:28.133 --> 17:29.600
but I would like to talk about it.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.600
That judge would only send me back.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.667
He might not. Some people stay.

17:34.734 --> 17:36.133
You're looking at one.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.166
Arnold Schwarzenegger
became an American citizen,

17:40.233 --> 17:43.433
started a whole new career,
married a Kennedy.

17:44.333 --> 17:48.433
Right now he's tearing off another guy's
arm and hitting him with it...

17:49.400 --> 17:52.867
-but you see my point?
-I don't want to return.

17:53.433 --> 17:54.433
I know you don't...

17:54.834 --> 17:56.567
and I don't want you to go, either.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.934
I wish I could say you won't have
to return, but I can't.

18:01.667 --> 18:06.667
But running away isn't the answer.
Whoa!

18:07.467 --> 18:09.400
Oh, I'm sorry, Mario.

18:09.467 --> 18:14.600
I never realized that ripping off a nose
would leave that big a hole.

18:20.367 --> 18:25.100
Anyway, I read a story once that said,
"In America you always feel

18:25.166 --> 18:27.033
like you're among friends."

18:27.700 --> 18:28.700
What do you think?

18:29.767 --> 18:33.400
-That was just a story.
-I think it was true.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.266
Will you go see that judge with me?

18:38.333 --> 18:41.066
Will you start putting an "r" in February?

18:42.166 --> 18:43.166
Ok.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.300
Let's go home.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.633
-Ok, girls, let's go.
-Good.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.500
-Blanche.
-Dorothy, I just can't take my eyes

18:56.567 --> 18:57.867
off that man's body.

19:00.066 --> 19:01.233
I want to see more.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.667
He's covered in oil wearing a loincloth.
How much more can you see?

19:05.734 --> 19:08.133
I don't know, but I'm gonna
move down front and find out.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.133
Oh!

19:20.467 --> 19:22.867
Dorothy, what time did Mario
say he was coming over?

19:22.934 --> 19:24.533
Soon as he hears from the judge.

19:25.066 --> 19:27.867
Well, why couldn't that judge
make up his mind at the hearing?

19:27.934 --> 19:29.633
I thought he was going to.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.200
You know, I spent 20 minutes
giving him reasons

19:32.266 --> 19:34.400
why Mario should be allowed to stay.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.967
He just said, "thank you"
and excused us.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.166
Ok, Blanche, I finished making your lunch.
It's on the table.

19:40.233 --> 19:41.767
Won't you join me, Dorothy?

19:41.834 --> 19:44.767
It might help take my mind off Mario.

19:44.834 --> 19:47.033
Rose, did you make enough
for three of us?

19:47.100 --> 19:49.100
-Yes, I did.
-Good. Well, I'll save yours

19:49.166 --> 19:52.467
-for when you finish rotating my tires.
-(doorbell dinging)

19:58.367 --> 19:59.633
-Yes?
-Hi.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.266
I'm Sam Burns,
a friend of Blanche's.

20:02.333 --> 20:06.467
-Oh, come on in.
-I'm just dropping something off.

20:06.533 --> 20:10.367
I found these between the cushions
of my love seat.

20:10.433 --> 20:12.133
Blanche's earrings.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.400
She must've left them
there last week.

20:14.467 --> 20:18.500
Oh, and she left her watch, too.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.266
Her watch.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.233
Thank you.
I'll see that she gets them.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.300
Thank you.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.800
Blanche, could you come out here?

20:32.867 --> 20:33.867
What's wrong, honey?

20:34.467 --> 20:37.800
Sam Burns found these in his love seat.

20:37.867 --> 20:41.133
-My earrings! Thank you.
-Aren't we forgetting something?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.467
-What?
-An apology?

20:42.533 --> 20:46.333
You don't have to apologize
for sleeping with Sam. Everybody does.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.533
Blanche Devereaux,
sit down, shut up, and listen.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.200
I didn't sleep with him.
I didn't lose the earrings, you did.

20:55.734 --> 20:58.633
And my watch,
which I didn't know you borrowed.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.533
-I mentioned that.
-No, you didn't.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.800
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry doesn't cut it.

21:02.867 --> 21:05.900
I've spent all week
making your bed, your breakfast,

21:05.967 --> 21:09.200
making tuna fish
sandwiches with the crust cut off.

21:09.266 --> 21:12.233
All for nothing! It's all over now.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.900
You won't have this <i>wiedenfrugen</i>
to kick around anymore.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.100
What's all the shouting about?

21:24.166 --> 21:28.433
I'll explain it later.
Now I have to pour on southern charm.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.533
If that doesn't work,
I'll have to eat Yankee crow.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.633
(doorbell chimes)

21:41.800 --> 21:44.633
-I don't like the look on your face.
-Bad news.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.667
They're sending me back.

21:48.367 --> 21:50.500
Oh, Mario, I'm sorry.

21:50.900 --> 21:54.934
-It's not your fault.
-It's so unfair.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.467
I can't believe it.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.100
This doesn't mean that we'll have
to give up. We'll fight this.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.433
There are legal ways
to keep you in this country.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.834
Tomorrow we'll find out what they are.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.300
I have to go tomorrow.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.934
Then I'll fight it myself.
We'll get you back, I promise.

22:12.367 --> 22:14.233
I'm going to miss you.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.500
I'm going to miss you, too.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.133
Keep up with your homework.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.433
Write. Tell me how you're doing.

22:21.967 --> 22:22.967
I will.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.934
I'll never forget you.

22:26.600 --> 22:30.000
You won't have time to.
You'll be back before you know it.

22:30.533 --> 22:35.500
This is your home.
You're what this country is all about.

22:36.233 --> 22:38.233
Say goodbye to everyone for me.

22:38.834 --> 22:39.934
Ok.

22:42.467 --> 22:43.600
<i>Adios,</i> teach.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.233
Oh, Mario.

23:05.266 --> 23:08.767
Sweetheart, I did it for your own good.

23:09.266 --> 23:12.066
Treating you like a dog
was doing you a favor.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.500
Let's forget all about it now, ok?

23:22.667 --> 23:26.000
-Mario's going to have to go home.
-Oh, no!

23:26.533 --> 23:29.600
-He asked me to say goodbye for him.
-Honey, I'm so sorry.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.133
I could sure use a family hug now.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.400
Oh, darling. Oh, honey.

23:36.934 --> 23:39.000
Dorothy, you've had a rough day.

23:39.467 --> 23:44.166
I'll tell you what. Go get into bed,
and I'll bring you some hot chocolate.

23:44.233 --> 23:49.000
-You don't have to.
-I'll bring cookies and the TV.

23:49.066 --> 23:52.533
-You really don't have to bother.
-Oh, it's no bother.

23:53.133 --> 23:54.333
Thanks.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.934
You heard her, Blanche. Get cracking.

24:15.400 --> 24:20.066
(theme music playing)
