00:00.850 --> 00:02.662
When is the food going to come?

00:02.687 --> 00:03.919
We just ordered.

00:03.953 --> 00:04.818
I'm bored.

00:04.818 --> 00:06.052
Me, too.

00:06.086 --> 00:07.199
You never see your father.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.154
Have a conversation with him.

00:10.324 --> 00:11.591
Hello, Father.

00:11.625 --> 00:14.394
Oh, hello, daughter.

00:14.428 --> 00:15.928
Now what?

00:15.962 --> 00:17.797
All right, I have an idea.

00:17.831 --> 00:19.499
Let's all do impressions
of people in our family.

00:19.533 --> 00:20.800
Ooh, yes!

00:20.834 --> 00:22.034
Please let me be Mommy.

00:22.069 --> 00:23.135
Okay, you be Mommy,

00:23.170 --> 00:24.504
and I will be Ella.

00:24.538 --> 00:25.805
This is stupid.

00:25.839 --> 00:27.540
This is stupid.

00:27.575 --> 00:28.808
You're the worst, Mommy.

00:28.842 --> 00:30.042
You never let me do anything.

00:30.077 --> 00:31.310
Shut up, asshole.

00:31.344 --> 00:32.818
Hey!

00:34.078 --> 00:35.994
No offense, Mom, you do curse a lot.

00:36.019 --> 00:37.856
Like, all the time.

00:37.881 --> 00:39.115
Constantly.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.746
Shut up, asshole.

00:47.584 --> 00:48.691
Hey, hey.

00:48.725 --> 00:50.060
Look how in control I am.

00:50.094 --> 00:51.310
Thank you.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.648
I can keep liquor in my
house just for my friends

00:53.673 --> 00:56.274
and I don't touch it and
I don't want to touch it.

00:56.308 --> 00:57.508
It's impressive.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.677
Thank you.

00:59.711 --> 01:00.845
Look at that.

01:01.035 --> 01:02.902
Look at our kids playing together, huh?

01:02.930 --> 01:03.984
Isn't it great?

01:04.009 --> 01:05.295
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

01:05.319 --> 01:06.553
God.

01:06.587 --> 01:08.222
Ella is so big.

01:08.256 --> 01:09.890
And mean.

01:09.924 --> 01:11.545
- Oh...
- At least to me.

01:11.584 --> 01:14.164
- Oh, teenage girls and their mothers.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14.189 --> 01:17.172
Man, I cannot wait until Caitlin
hates Roxanne.

01:17.197 --> 01:19.377
Hey, look who's here.

01:19.402 --> 01:19.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19.903 --> 01:20.635
- Hey.

01:20.660 --> 01:22.327
- Hi.
- Where's the wife?

01:22.362 --> 01:25.390
She's, uh, picking up a couple
of things for her trip.

01:25.415 --> 01:26.834
What? Where's she going?

01:26.859 --> 01:28.503
She's taking Harrison
back east to see her mom.

01:28.528 --> 01:30.029
Solo Mother's Day?

01:30.064 --> 01:31.206
She said that I didn't have to go,

01:31.231 --> 01:33.699
so... so I'm a free man.

01:33.734 --> 01:34.637
Well, I don't have any plans.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.436
You want to... do something? Hang out?

01:37.471 --> 01:40.172
I'm not that free.

01:40.206 --> 01:42.280
You know, I love it when you
play hard to get.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.816
Yeah, I'm not playing.

01:45.764 --> 01:47.899
Uh, I thought you usually spend Mother's Day

01:47.899 --> 01:49.233
with Roxanne's family.

01:49.268 --> 01:50.468
New shrink.

01:50.502 --> 01:51.735
Doesn't think it's healthy.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.304
Oh. I like this new shrink.

01:53.339 --> 01:55.440
What's that supposed to mean?

01:55.561 --> 01:58.781
Well, I mean, you just spend a lot
of time with your ex.

01:58.806 --> 02:00.272
I get lonely.

02:00.307 --> 02:01.185
There's a reason

02:01.185 --> 02:02.951
suicides spike around the holidays.

02:02.985 --> 02:04.598
Come on.

02:04.623 --> 02:05.889
Mother's Day?

02:05.924 --> 02:09.192
Mother's Day, Halloween...

02:09.227 --> 02:10.828
Secretary's Day.

02:12.670 --> 02:13.870
I'm not joking.

02:13.904 --> 02:15.439
That's one of the hardest ones.

02:15.473 --> 02:19.151
Well, you're welcome to join us.

02:20.543 --> 02:22.711
I don't want to intrude.

02:22.746 --> 02:25.748
Okay.

02:25.783 --> 02:27.650
Okay, I'll come.

02:27.684 --> 02:29.741
Great.

02:29.766 --> 02:31.612
â™ª

02:31.647 --> 02:33.649
I don't care if you want to go to the mall.

02:33.674 --> 02:35.388
You're not going to the
mall without a parent.

02:35.413 --> 02:37.780
Harper's mom lets Harper
go to the mall by herself.

02:37.805 --> 02:39.954
I am not Harper's mother. I am your mother.

02:39.979 --> 02:41.347
Because I can see your ass cheeks,

02:41.381 --> 02:43.458
and some guy is gonna
take you in the bathroom

02:43.483 --> 02:44.984
and shave your head and throw you in a van,

02:45.019 --> 02:46.209
and you're never coming home!

02:46.234 --> 02:47.250
Stop yelling at me!

02:47.275 --> 02:48.615
Stop acting like a baby!

02:48.640 --> 02:50.504
- You're ruining Mother's Day!
- Jesus.

02:50.529 --> 02:51.607
You're ruining my life!

03:03.205 --> 03:04.705
Where's Mommy?

03:04.739 --> 03:06.107
She left.

03:06.141 --> 03:07.728
What did you do?

03:07.753 --> 03:09.543
Of course.

03:09.578 --> 03:12.046
It's all my fault.

03:12.081 --> 03:13.348
I didn't say that.

03:13.382 --> 03:15.416
You kind of did.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.591
Excuse me, how much are these?

03:23.625 --> 03:25.125
You know what? Don't even tell me.

03:25.159 --> 03:26.961
No prices today.

03:32.066 --> 03:33.567
- Yes?
- You're alive.

03:33.602 --> 03:34.969
It's too late, Russ.

03:35.003 --> 03:36.268
I'm already in Mexico.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.838
Okay, look. Ella is really sorry.

03:38.873 --> 03:40.399
Is she?

03:40.424 --> 03:43.025
Well, she probably will be.

03:43.276 --> 03:45.077
You know, at some point.

03:45.112 --> 03:46.579
When she has kids of her own.

03:46.606 --> 03:47.802
I knew it.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.594
Come on. I want my wife back.

03:49.817 --> 03:51.733
Well, that little shit won't
go to Sweet Jam.

03:51.758 --> 03:53.295
It's Mother's Day, and I'm not even allowed

03:53.320 --> 03:55.121
to pick where we eat? What the hell?

03:55.146 --> 03:57.213
What is going on with you guys?

03:57.246 --> 03:58.088
She hates me.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.655
She doesn't hate you.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.933
She just doesn't love you
as much as she used to.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.592
Anything else?

04:04.617 --> 04:06.485
What time is the reservation?

04:06.510 --> 04:08.010
Not until 2:00.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.768
All right. I will get her there.

04:09.802 --> 04:11.003
How?

04:11.037 --> 04:12.404
I don't know,

04:12.438 --> 04:14.793
but I'll think of something.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.610
All right, guys, we're here.

04:25.635 --> 04:27.485
Uh, this isn't Harvey's.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.819
No, it's a new place.

04:28.854 --> 04:30.088
Better than Harvey's.

04:30.122 --> 04:31.604
Oh, my God.

04:31.629 --> 04:32.930
This is Mommy's place!

04:33.105 --> 04:34.339
This is bullshit.

04:34.364 --> 04:36.506
- You tricked me.
- Hey, watch it, okay?

04:36.531 --> 04:37.765
I had to get you in the car.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.519
- We always go to Harvey's.
- Yeah, well,

04:39.544 --> 04:41.356
Mommy wanted to go to a new place this year.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.614
It's Mother's Day.

04:42.639 --> 04:44.756
Hey, Bowmans, what's going on?

04:44.781 --> 04:46.282
Where is the big lady?

04:46.307 --> 04:47.540
Uh...

04:47.565 --> 04:49.899
she and Ella had a tough morning,

04:49.924 --> 04:51.350
so she'll be here soon.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.035
- Oh.
- Hopefully.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.443
Okay, well, our table is ready.

04:55.467 --> 04:57.167
I'm not going in.

04:57.192 --> 04:59.420
I love it when you guys get
all dysfunctional around me.

04:59.445 --> 05:02.475
It makes me feel like I'm a
part of the family, you know?

05:02.708 --> 05:05.042
Come on. Let's go in.
Let's go sit down at our table.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.748
All right, yeah. Let's fight inside, guys.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.552
Come on.

05:19.564 --> 05:22.366
Hey, man.

05:22.408 --> 05:23.878
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:23.903 --> 05:26.237
Oh, somebody's done some
Mother's Day shopping.

05:26.262 --> 05:27.663
Yeah.

05:27.855 --> 05:29.766
I'm gonna go home and pretend

05:29.791 --> 05:31.408
my family bought this stuff for me.

05:31.433 --> 05:33.134
Well, good for you.

05:33.159 --> 05:35.054
What's your story?

05:35.088 --> 05:37.422
Just airing out the kid.

05:37.457 --> 05:39.791
I thought Jess was taking
Harrison back east.

05:39.826 --> 05:41.120
Yeah, well, she was going to,

05:41.145 --> 05:43.113
but then she remembered how difficult it is

05:43.138 --> 05:44.672
to travel with a toddler.

05:44.831 --> 05:46.756
I don't miss that.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.115
Yeah. Where's your clan?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.573
We broke up.

05:49.895 --> 05:51.359
Good call.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.486
- Well, you're welcome to hang out with us.
- Excuse me.

05:53.512 --> 05:57.290
Excuse me, your son is stealing my wishes.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.936
What?

05:58.960 --> 06:01.257
Oh, sweetie, n-n-no, don't take the money.

06:01.283 --> 06:03.551
- I'm so sorry.
- Those are wishes.

06:03.576 --> 06:05.109
How many wishes were there?

06:05.134 --> 06:07.099
Just one.

06:08.914 --> 06:10.115
It was a good one.

06:10.149 --> 06:12.183
Yeah.

06:12.218 --> 06:13.418
Just...

06:17.175 --> 06:19.484
Is she actually inside the restaurant?

06:19.517 --> 06:22.576
She's basically inside.

06:22.601 --> 06:23.901
So she's not inside.

06:23.945 --> 06:25.679
Can you just get over here?

06:25.713 --> 06:28.454
Why? So she can make some
big show about not going in?

06:28.479 --> 06:29.287
No. Forget it.

06:29.313 --> 06:31.774
I am tired of being the bad guy.

06:31.853 --> 06:33.939
Today you can be the bad guy.

06:35.916 --> 06:37.649
Everything okay?

06:37.674 --> 06:40.542
Ella's refusing to go to
my Mother's Day brunch.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.334
The one that you're not at?

06:43.356 --> 06:45.691
She was the cutest baby.

06:45.716 --> 06:47.483
Well, listen...

06:47.508 --> 06:49.922
They don't stay cute forever.

06:49.947 --> 06:51.966
You know? Hey, it's just a matter of time

06:51.991 --> 06:54.207
before little Harrison is whacking off

06:54.232 --> 06:56.233
in every corner of the house.

06:56.577 --> 07:00.313
Ella has been taking long baths lately.

07:00.347 --> 07:02.815
Probably flicking it to One Direction.

07:02.849 --> 07:04.416
Liam or Harry?

07:04.450 --> 07:05.718
Nice.

07:05.752 --> 07:07.019
Listen.

07:07.054 --> 07:08.353
It's just hormones, you know?

07:08.388 --> 07:09.755
Whatever she's going through,

07:09.790 --> 07:11.724
she will grow out of it.

07:11.758 --> 07:14.593
Okay, but what about the other two?

07:14.627 --> 07:16.328
They're so cute right now,

07:16.362 --> 07:18.347
but when I see what's around the corner...

07:18.372 --> 07:19.158
Three girls.

07:19.183 --> 07:20.599
Shit.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.234
See, boys are just not that complicated.

07:22.268 --> 07:24.503
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

07:24.537 --> 07:26.538
Thank you for admitting my life is worse.

07:26.573 --> 07:28.173
Oh, sure.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.809
How old is Harrison now? Three?

07:30.843 --> 07:32.444
Four. Next month.

07:32.478 --> 07:34.079
Are you doing a party?

07:34.113 --> 07:35.480
I don't know.

07:35.515 --> 07:36.981
I should.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.807
He's a child.

07:38.832 --> 07:40.128
They like that.

07:40.153 --> 07:41.520
They do.

07:41.652 --> 07:44.420
Our birthday packages are all-inclusive.

07:44.445 --> 07:46.547
Food, cake, gift bags.

07:46.572 --> 07:48.033
All you have to do is show up.

07:48.058 --> 07:49.825
Terrific. And what's your June look like?

07:49.850 --> 07:51.235
Uh, it should be pretty open.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.993
- Hey, buddy.
- We...

07:53.505 --> 07:55.121
- Is this your son?
- Yep.

07:55.146 --> 07:57.310
Harrison's turning the big oh-four.

07:58.023 --> 07:59.558
Harrison.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.783
That's right.

08:00.808 --> 08:03.630
Oh, shoot.

08:03.655 --> 08:05.593
Actually, I just realized...

08:05.618 --> 08:06.434
You said June?

08:06.459 --> 08:07.672
- Right.
- Yeah.

08:07.697 --> 08:10.318
Boy, we are pretty booked up.

08:12.468 --> 08:14.215
Ah.

08:16.601 --> 08:19.069
Relax. She'll come in eventually.

08:19.168 --> 08:21.312
- Are you sure?
- Totally.

08:21.337 --> 08:24.172
Besides, abductions in this
neighborhood are way down.

08:24.197 --> 08:25.498
Now, if we were in Boyle Heights,

08:25.523 --> 08:27.124
girls there, they just...

08:28.812 --> 08:30.679
- Hi.
- That's so helpful.

08:30.704 --> 08:31.711
You don't like the truth?

08:31.736 --> 08:33.774
Happy Mother's Day, everyone.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.020
Can I start anyone with a drink?

08:36.046 --> 08:38.480
Uh, I think just water, please.

08:38.505 --> 08:39.639
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be back

08:39.664 --> 08:40.669
to take your order in a minute.

08:40.693 --> 08:42.061
Great. Thanks.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.486
And can I just say,

08:43.511 --> 08:45.518
you two have such a beautiful family.

08:45.543 --> 08:47.831
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- No.

08:47.856 --> 08:49.855
We're... we're not...

08:49.880 --> 08:52.945
All here yet. Our eldest is having
a bit of a moment.

08:52.970 --> 08:54.303
She'll be here soon.

08:54.328 --> 08:56.290
Three girls. That's adorable.

08:56.315 --> 08:58.316
We got our hands full, man.

08:58.499 --> 09:00.466
Did you hear that?

09:00.491 --> 09:02.633
He thinks I brought you
here for Mother's Day.

09:02.658 --> 09:05.373
Uh, so I am the mother?

09:05.398 --> 09:07.365
You're very nurturing.

09:07.390 --> 09:09.417
No, I am not the mom.

09:09.441 --> 09:13.378
Face it: I am the top, you are the bottom.

09:13.403 --> 09:14.511
What's a "bottom"?

09:14.537 --> 09:16.464
When two people love each other,

09:16.489 --> 09:20.001
somebody has to be the top,
and somebody has to be the bottom.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.142
- AJ.
- Which one's better?

09:22.167 --> 09:24.053
- There's no better or worse.
- Yeah.

09:24.078 --> 09:25.712
- You are what you are.
- That's right.

09:25.737 --> 09:28.541
There's no shame in being a
bottom, right, AJ?

09:28.566 --> 09:30.534
I wouldn't know. Eh.

09:30.559 --> 09:33.099
If your dad and I were in a relationship,

09:33.124 --> 09:36.081
I would dominate him.

09:40.570 --> 09:42.404
Try that one.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.707
This one does come with pizza also, so...

09:44.732 --> 09:46.250
- That's weird, right?
- Hmm?

09:46.275 --> 09:48.433
I mean, one minute,
they're hungry for the business,

09:48.458 --> 09:49.825
the next minute, they're booked?

09:49.850 --> 09:52.251
Eh, what are you gonna do?

09:52.276 --> 09:54.244
Something's up with her.

09:54.269 --> 09:55.636
Let it go.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.594
I can't.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.830
So we have a couple different packages...

10:00.855 --> 10:03.016
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.343
Could you give me just a second? Thank you.

10:05.368 --> 10:08.446
I just wanted to double-check
about the party.

10:08.471 --> 10:11.702
Yes. Ugh, I forgot June was booked.

10:11.727 --> 10:12.597
Sorry.

10:12.622 --> 10:13.926
What about July?

10:13.951 --> 10:16.242
Ooh, pretty busy.

10:16.481 --> 10:17.914
August?

10:17.939 --> 10:20.906
I can put you on a wait list.

10:20.931 --> 10:21.842
I'm confused.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.429
My friend is a good guy.

10:23.454 --> 10:25.341
Like, a really good guy.

10:25.802 --> 10:29.548
Look... I know his wife.

10:30.222 --> 10:31.693
Okay.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.200
She's been in here before with her friends.

10:34.225 --> 10:37.468
I just don't feel comfortable
hosting a party for her.

10:37.493 --> 10:39.889
I don't understand.

10:40.981 --> 10:44.401
She and a few other moms
went in the bathroom here,

10:44.426 --> 10:49.296
and when they came out, they
had the... the sniffles.

10:50.446 --> 10:52.615
Oh.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.626
So you're gonna punish a child?

10:56.651 --> 10:59.665
No, I don't want to punish anybody.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.704
Except people who do cocaine
in a children's play space.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.099
Strict.

11:08.573 --> 11:10.985
I would dominate the hell out of you.

11:11.010 --> 11:13.721
Excuse me, is that your daughter out there?

11:13.746 --> 11:15.734
You know, actually it's his daughter.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.844
That's what I always like to say

11:16.869 --> 11:18.770
whenever she gets temperamental like this.

11:18.795 --> 11:20.556
Like mother, like daughter.

11:20.581 --> 11:22.142
I think they're on the same cycle.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.513
Well, my manager's saying

11:23.538 --> 11:25.639
she just can't stand
alone outside like that,

11:25.664 --> 11:28.040
so if you could go talk to her, maybe... ?

11:28.065 --> 11:30.271
Or we can make your order to go?

11:30.296 --> 11:31.484
Oh, we'll take care of it.

11:31.509 --> 11:33.085
Thank you.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.662
How are we supposed to get her in here?

11:37.687 --> 11:39.089
A top wouldn't ask that question.

11:39.114 --> 11:41.213
Excuse me.

11:43.028 --> 11:44.813
Hey.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.314
You know, if you come in now,

11:47.339 --> 11:49.313
we'll let you order off the adult menu.

11:49.338 --> 11:51.306
I'm not hungry.

11:51.331 --> 11:53.232
Not even for lobster, huh?

11:53.257 --> 11:55.659
How about caviar?

11:55.684 --> 11:57.985
Isn't that, like, fish eggs?

11:58.010 --> 11:59.309
Yeah.

11:59.683 --> 12:02.495
Look, I don't know what is going on,

12:02.520 --> 12:04.611
but, you know, you got to realize

12:04.636 --> 12:07.013
that you're keeping your family apart today.

12:09.942 --> 12:12.911
I was really looking forward to this brunch.

12:13.127 --> 12:16.529
I don't get to be with
my kid on Mother's Day.

12:16.554 --> 12:18.521
She gets to be with her mother

12:18.546 --> 12:22.660
because of this stupid sexist holiday.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.944
Anyway, I was hoping being with you guys

12:27.969 --> 12:29.092
would make me feel better,

12:29.117 --> 12:30.876
but you're actually making me feel worse.

12:30.901 --> 12:32.053
You're almost making me feel

12:32.078 --> 12:33.879
like maybe I should have a drink.

12:33.904 --> 12:36.872
An alcoholic drink.

12:37.096 --> 12:39.564
You know I'm an alcoholic, right?

12:39.589 --> 12:42.695
Uh, yeah, it's, like,
all you ever talk about.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.085
We're raising a sociopath.

12:53.110 --> 12:54.856
Yeah, we're raising a teenager.

12:54.881 --> 12:56.556
I'm raising a teenager.

12:57.247 --> 12:59.685
Jesus.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.486
So what's the scoop?

13:06.511 --> 13:10.038
It's being closed for six
weeks for a reality show.

13:10.063 --> 13:11.864
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:11.898 --> 13:13.465
What show is that?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.868
Um, I don't remember.

13:15.902 --> 13:21.086
Uh, <i>Later, Bitches</i> or, um,
<i>I Thought I Could Sing.</i>

13:22.742 --> 13:25.844
I appreciate the lying, but...

13:25.878 --> 13:29.247
I think I know what happened there.

13:29.281 --> 13:31.716
We were just "Jess-balled."

13:31.751 --> 13:33.051
What?

13:33.077 --> 13:34.621
Like blackballed.

13:34.646 --> 13:36.797
When Jess does something,
and then we're not allowed back.

13:36.822 --> 13:38.289
We were Jess-balled.

13:38.323 --> 13:41.259
Believe me, I'm used to it already.

13:41.293 --> 13:43.261
Sorry.

13:43.295 --> 13:45.095
Nobody's perfect.

13:45.130 --> 13:47.365
Oh, no, no.

13:47.399 --> 13:49.233
Your cigar...

13:49.268 --> 13:51.039
- Is it bad?
- No.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.465
Reminds me of my dad.

13:53.490 --> 13:56.216
Smell hung around longer than he did.

13:56.241 --> 13:58.434
Here.

13:58.550 --> 14:01.297
Happy Mother's Day to you.

14:01.322 --> 14:03.852
Who told you?

14:04.772 --> 14:07.208
How old were you when your...
when your dad checked out?

14:07.251 --> 14:08.618
Ella's age.

14:08.652 --> 14:10.653
I was 11.

14:10.868 --> 14:13.325
I was such a bitch to my mom.

14:13.350 --> 14:14.751
Well, yeah.

14:14.776 --> 14:16.479
You punish the parent that's around more.

14:16.504 --> 14:17.703
That's how it works.

14:17.728 --> 14:19.729
Yep.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.383
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

14:23.408 --> 14:24.879
I'm impressed.

14:26.047 --> 14:27.681
I remember thinking,

14:27.706 --> 14:30.656
"I would never screw up a family like that."

14:30.765 --> 14:35.232
And I swore to myself I'd never get married.

14:35.550 --> 14:37.952
Almost made it.

14:43.255 --> 14:46.223
I should have gone with the chocolates.

14:54.217 --> 14:57.440
Whatever. Maybe we should just give up,
get the orders to go.

14:57.465 --> 14:59.532
Give up? No.

14:59.557 --> 15:01.524
Not a chance. No way.

15:01.549 --> 15:03.144
I'm not giving up.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.202
I'm not letting her win.

15:05.434 --> 15:07.416
Okay, I like your attitude.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.595
Yeah, I'm not gonna back down; she's a kid.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.054
I mean, come on, give me a break.

15:11.079 --> 15:13.448
Whoa, who's this guy?

15:13.473 --> 15:15.544
Maybe you are a top.

15:15.569 --> 15:17.470
Are you okay with that?

15:18.697 --> 15:21.098
Look...

15:21.806 --> 15:24.174
there's only one guy I'd bottom up for.

15:24.725 --> 15:26.593
Don't make me cry.

15:27.745 --> 15:29.602
Bring her home, Mommy.

15:29.627 --> 15:31.193
I mean "Daddy." I'm sorry.

15:31.218 --> 15:33.314
Got it.

15:36.488 --> 15:38.163
Hey.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.555
Hey.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.777
All right, what's it gonna take?

15:43.613 --> 15:46.015
- Hello.
- Uh, give it back!

15:46.040 --> 15:49.298
I promised Mommy I would get you inside.
Come on.

15:50.355 --> 15:52.622
Mommy hates me.

15:53.045 --> 15:54.826
That's crazy.

15:54.851 --> 15:56.795
She loves you more than anything.

15:57.028 --> 15:59.763
You don't see the way she treats me.

15:59.788 --> 16:01.930
You're not there.

16:02.722 --> 16:06.625
Yes, you're right, I'm not there, and...

16:07.246 --> 16:10.450
maybe that's part of the problem, you know?

16:10.475 --> 16:13.510
It's hard for Mommy when I'm not there.

16:13.535 --> 16:15.936
But you need to help out more;
you're the oldest.

16:15.961 --> 16:18.483
But I don't want to be the oldest.

16:18.508 --> 16:22.451
Hey, I... don't always want to be the dad.

16:23.787 --> 16:25.788
Some of the time.

16:28.219 --> 16:31.170
Really? She's still out here?

16:33.283 --> 16:36.386
I just wanted to go to Harvey's.

16:36.411 --> 16:38.512
Like when I was little.

16:39.536 --> 16:43.218
Oh, baby.

16:43.289 --> 16:45.951
You're not little anymore.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.738
And Harvey's is gross.

16:49.763 --> 16:53.743
I saw a homeless man die there once.

16:53.898 --> 16:56.750
Yeah. I couldn't tell you
'cause you were too little,

16:56.775 --> 16:59.783
but you're old enough to
hear the weird stuff now.

17:02.393 --> 17:05.671
Come on, Mommy needs a mimosa.

17:06.946 --> 17:08.080
Thank you.

17:08.106 --> 17:09.272
So how'd you do it?

17:09.298 --> 17:12.017
I just told her to cut the shit.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.308
Really?

17:16.878 --> 17:18.280
Lina did it.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.271
Oh, shit.

17:20.297 --> 17:21.741
You know what this means, right?

17:21.766 --> 17:24.167
Yeah, we're both bottoms.

17:24.193 --> 17:27.194
Hey, we're not just any old bottoms.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.888
We're power bottoms.

17:29.913 --> 17:32.147
- Power bottoms?
- Yeah.

17:32.172 --> 17:35.507
It's where the bottom
tells the top what to do.

17:36.274 --> 17:38.375
I can live with that.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.099
Little domination from down under.

17:41.755 --> 17:43.555
Power bottoms rule.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.140
Hmm, totally.

17:48.229 --> 17:50.634
I'm sorry I didn't more today.

17:50.634 --> 17:51.767
You were there.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.125
I was totally here. That's something.

17:54.150 --> 17:55.666
You want to fool around?

17:55.839 --> 17:57.240
Um...

17:57.265 --> 17:59.932
What if my Mother's Day present...

17:59.956 --> 18:04.579
is that I don't have to have sex with you?

18:04.604 --> 18:07.572
Okay.

18:07.911 --> 18:11.279
But that is what I gave
you for your birthday.

18:11.963 --> 18:15.022
- Get the lube.
- Yes!
