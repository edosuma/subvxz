00:00.635 --> 00:03.765
Stefan: Mystic Falls...
I was born here.

00:03.767 --> 00:05.000
This is my home.

00:05.002 --> 00:08.200
Damon: And mine.
Elena: And mine.

00:08.202 --> 00:11.070
For centuries, supernatural
creatures have lived among us.

00:11.072 --> 00:14.040
Caroline: They were vampires,
werewolves, doppelgangers...

00:14.042 --> 00:15.612
Bonnie: Witches.
Klaus: And even hybrids.

00:15.614 --> 00:18.617
She needs human blood,
Stefan... from the vein.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.487
If she kills someone,
she will crumble.

00:20.489 --> 00:22.359
Shouldn't you be in mystic
falls killing vampires?

00:22.361 --> 00:24.865
Anybody gets in my way,
they're dead.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.806
Do I have your attention?

00:28.808 --> 00:30.612
Then let's talk about vampires.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.816
Run as fast as you can.

00:32.818 --> 00:34.484
Why are you protecting him?!

00:34.486 --> 00:36.385
Klaus will kill
anyone who knows!

00:36.387 --> 00:38.659
Connor's tattoo is
the key to a cure for Elena.

00:38.661 --> 00:40.764
Stay the hell
away from my brother!

00:43.068 --> 00:46.042
You said you were going
to protect Jeremy!

00:46.044 --> 00:48.881
I killed someone.

You know...

01:42.222 --> 01:43.923
It makes sense.

01:43.925 --> 01:45.391
Guilty conscience.

01:45.393 --> 01:47.561
You're not here. I'm...

01:47.563 --> 01:50.101
I've got to be dreaming.

01:50.103 --> 01:52.103
Then how do you know
that I'm not here?

01:52.105 --> 01:55.574
Because you're...
[Gulps]

01:55.576 --> 01:58.248
Go on. Say it.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.420
Because you're dead.

02:02.422 --> 02:06.658
Yes.
I am.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.496
Was that the first time
that you've taken a human life?

02:09.497 --> 02:12.599
You're a ghost.

02:12.601 --> 02:15.403
It's got to be...
You're a ghost.

02:15.405 --> 02:17.405
That's... that's what's
happening right now.

02:17.407 --> 02:19.306
Je... Jeremy.

02:19.308 --> 02:21.308
Jeremy!

02:21.310 --> 02:22.944
[Gasping] You're a ghost.

02:22.946 --> 02:25.414
You're haunting me.
You're a ghost.

02:25.416 --> 02:27.349
You're haunting me.
Can a ghost do this?

02:41.369 --> 02:43.436
Oh, my God!

02:43.438 --> 02:45.673
Oh! Jer! Jer!

02:45.675 --> 02:47.809
Jer! Jer! No, no, no!

02:47.811 --> 02:50.279
No!

02:50.281 --> 02:51.812
No. No, Jer!

02:51.814 --> 02:53.448

I can't believe
this happened.

03:00.259 --> 03:02.058
What... what am I
going to say to him?

03:02.060 --> 03:03.427
Thanks for not ditching
the family ring

03:03.429 --> 03:05.530
after it drove
Ric crazy?

03:05.532 --> 03:07.497
You should have
called Stefan.

03:07.499 --> 03:09.600
I don't want to talk to him.

03:09.602 --> 03:12.668
He's been lying to me,
and hiding things from me.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.603
He compelled Jeremy
to forget God knows what.

03:14.605 --> 03:16.638
In all fairness,
I mean,

03:16.640 --> 03:19.773
I think you killing him
kind of trumps that.

03:19.775 --> 03:21.540
I mean, you should
have called Stefan.

03:21.542 --> 03:24.042
I don't trust him
right now, Damon.

03:24.044 --> 03:25.677
[Door opens]
Hey.

03:25.679 --> 03:28.379
P.S.... I called Stefan.

03:28.381 --> 03:30.213
What happened?
Why didn't you call me?

03:30.215 --> 03:33.449
I just... I need to go
upstairs and shower.

03:33.451 --> 03:36.750
Clean all the blood
off my hands.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.653
[Gasping]

03:40.655 --> 03:43.321
Welcome back.
How you feeling?

03:43.323 --> 03:46.491
What happened?

03:46.493 --> 03:49.163
Long story.
Buy the e-book.

03:52.601 --> 03:55.734
Elena?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.737
Hey.

03:57.739 --> 04:00.472
Listen, I know you're still
upset about yesterday,

04:00.474 --> 04:04.175
and I get it. Believe me.
But just... let me help you.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.412
I don't want your help
right now, Stefan.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.883
But you'll accept Damon's?

04:08.885 --> 04:11.086
Don't make this
about Damon!

04:11.088 --> 04:12.856
You've been working
with Klaus doing

04:12.858 --> 04:15.859
God knows what, and don't
insult me by trying to deny it.

04:15.861 --> 04:17.594
Listen, it's not what
you think, ok?

04:17.596 --> 04:19.628
I don't know
what to think.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.296
But I do know
that I don't want to talk to you

04:21.298 --> 04:22.731
and I don't really want to
be around you right now.

04:22.733 --> 04:25.402
- Look, please, just...
- No.

04:27.170 --> 04:31.038
This is my brother's blood
on my hands, Stefan.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.741
I stabbed him in the neck
last night,

04:32.743 --> 04:35.580
so forgive me if I'm not
in the mood to listen you

04:35.582 --> 04:37.880
try to talk your way
out of this.

04:41.650 --> 04:44.616
[Music playing]

04:44.618 --> 04:47.051
You're still going?

04:47.053 --> 04:48.755
I drank enough last night.

04:48.757 --> 04:51.392
And then I slept, which is
what you guys should have done.

04:51.394 --> 04:53.726
We're just paying
our respects to Dean.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.663
That's great, Chris, but would
you pay them at a bar instead?

04:56.665 --> 04:58.231
Don't be mad.

04:58.233 --> 05:01.304
We're celebrating our
fallen hybrid friend.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.219
Well, don't let me interrupt.

05:15.221 --> 05:17.688
I didn't know
you were here.

05:17.690 --> 05:19.456
Clearly.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.727
Mmm.

05:22.729 --> 05:24.729
Thought I'd just
pop 'round

05:24.731 --> 05:27.497
to celebrate
Dean's successful retrieval

05:27.499 --> 05:29.432
of the vampire hunter.

05:29.434 --> 05:30.833
Yet when I arrived,

05:30.835 --> 05:34.936
I learned that not only
was Dean unsuccessful,

05:34.938 --> 05:36.804
but that Elena
killed the hunter.

05:36.806 --> 05:38.974
Well, maybe if you had
let Dean use force on Connor

05:38.976 --> 05:41.443
instead of sending him in
on a suicide mission...

05:41.445 --> 05:43.814
Maybe you should mind
your business, wolf girl.

05:43.816 --> 05:46.648
What do you care if Connor's dead,
anyway?

05:46.650 --> 05:49.482
I have my reasons.

05:49.484 --> 05:51.217
They have ceased
to matter.

05:51.219 --> 05:52.717
Cheers.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.883
[Knock on door]

06:00.823 --> 06:03.388
Brought your stuff.
Old laptop, your Jersey,

06:03.390 --> 06:04.991
the charm bracelet.

06:04.993 --> 06:06.693
Car...

06:06.695 --> 06:09.962
- This isn't a good time.
- Just take it.

06:14.733 --> 06:17.537
Caroline.

06:20.807 --> 06:24.243
By the break-up drama unfolding
before me, I assume you've met Haley.

06:26.713 --> 06:30.314
All right, come on, let's go.
Let's leave them alone.

06:30.316 --> 06:32.919
- Your talents are needed elsewhere.
- For what?

06:32.921 --> 06:35.588
I think you've got more important
things to deal with, mate.

06:53.138 --> 06:56.640
- Do you think he bought it?
- Hell, I bought it.

06:56.642 --> 06:59.443
Thanks for the head's up
that he was here, Haley.

06:59.445 --> 07:02.948
You girls are good liars.

07:15.598 --> 07:18.136
[Elena sighs]

07:25.547 --> 07:28.712
[Gasping]

07:41.428 --> 07:43.564
Where'd Jeremy go?

07:43.566 --> 07:46.601
School. Bonnie has him volunteering
for some occult exhibit.

07:46.603 --> 07:49.370
Or maybe he didn't want
to linger in a house

07:49.372 --> 07:51.638
where his sister just
jammed a knife in his neck.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.809
[Cell phone rings]
It's Klaus.

07:54.811 --> 07:56.877
Ooh, time to face the music,

07:56.879 --> 07:58.979
pay the piper,
dance with the devil.

07:58.981 --> 08:01.081
You know, I'm glad
you find this amusing.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.048
If he finds out I told you about
the cure, he'll kill both of us.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.183
Quit avoiding him.
You're being shady.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.084
Shady people get outed.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.620
I don't want
to talk about it.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.455
Well, I can't imagine why,
what with you ruining

08:11.457 --> 08:13.623
all my plans
for a hybrid-filled future.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.992
Well, it wouldn't happened if
you hadn't sworn me to secrecy.

08:15.994 --> 08:17.829
Life's full
of ifs, Stefan.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.067
Let's extenuate
the positives, shall we?

08:20.069 --> 08:22.200
The hunter was one of five.
We'll find another.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.103
It may take centuries, but we've
got nothing but time, right?

08:25.105 --> 08:28.676
You're using your calm voice today.
Who's getting killed?

08:28.678 --> 08:30.977
Not you, if that's what
you're worried about.

08:30.979 --> 08:33.245
But I am concerned
about your beloved.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.448
Have the hallucinations
started yet?

08:36.754 --> 08:39.188
What do you know
about that?

08:39.190 --> 08:40.957
I'll tell you.
Where you are?

08:40.960 --> 08:43.025
I'm at her house.
How convenient.

08:43.028 --> 08:44.828
So am I.

08:47.663 --> 08:49.996
You know, this would all be
a lot more civilized

08:49.998 --> 08:52.100
if I was just
invited inside.

08:52.102 --> 08:54.369
Bad enough I'm out here
talking to you.

08:54.371 --> 08:55.804
What do you know?

08:55.806 --> 08:59.806
I killed the Original
five hunters, remember?

08:59.808 --> 09:01.641
When one kills a hunter,

09:01.643 --> 09:02.909
there's a bit
of a consequence.

09:02.911 --> 09:04.645
What kind of consequence?

09:04.647 --> 09:07.348
Hunters were spelled by
witches to kill vampires.

09:07.350 --> 09:09.551
If you prevent one from
fulfilling his destiny,

09:09.553 --> 09:11.187
then he'll take you
down with him.

09:11.189 --> 09:12.890
What do you mean?
Connor's dead.

09:12.892 --> 09:14.792
I mean, Connor's death
won't prevent him

09:14.794 --> 09:18.963
from making Elena
his final vampire kill.

09:18.965 --> 09:20.598
She'll need
to come with me now.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.000
I'll lock her up;

09:22.002 --> 09:23.935
keep her away from any
sharp, wooden objects.

09:23.937 --> 09:25.169
She's not going
anywhere with you.

09:25.171 --> 09:26.637
But if we leave her alone,

09:26.639 --> 09:28.472
she'll take her own life
before the day is out.

09:28.474 --> 09:30.474
- She's stronger than that.
- Is she?

09:30.476 --> 09:32.773
Believe me,
it's for her own good.

09:34.342 --> 09:36.910
[Sighs]

09:41.446 --> 09:43.614
[Gasping]

09:46.502 --> 09:49.190
Would you like some?

09:49.192 --> 09:51.761
You seem to enjoy it
when you drink from me.

09:51.763 --> 09:54.866
I wasn't myself.

09:54.868 --> 09:56.400
I was angry.

09:56.402 --> 09:57.835
Were you yourself
when you snapped my neck

09:57.837 --> 10:00.339
- with your bare hands?
- You staked me!

10:00.341 --> 10:03.178
'Cause you're a monster
and you deserve to die.

10:03.180 --> 10:06.213
- Admit it.
- No!

10:08.249 --> 10:10.286
Damon...

10:10.288 --> 10:14.356
Decomposition starts
in the first 24 hours.

10:14.358 --> 10:16.924
I'm rotting in an unmarked
grave because of you.

10:16.926 --> 10:19.462
- No!
- What's wrong?

10:20.828 --> 10:22.332
Elena!

10:24.290 --> 10:26.904
Elena!

10:37.889 --> 10:42.025
Hey, do you see
anything on my hand?

10:42.027 --> 10:45.127
What if I told you I saw the
beginning of a mark like Connor's?

10:45.129 --> 10:46.928
Are you serious?

10:46.930 --> 10:49.966
It showed up
after he died.

10:49.968 --> 10:51.804
He told me that
I was a potential;

10:51.806 --> 10:53.475
that that's why I
could see his mark.

10:53.477 --> 10:55.776
So what does that make you,
like the next chosen one

10:55.778 --> 10:57.445
or something?
April: Hey, guys.

10:57.447 --> 10:58.947
Hey, April.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.749
Way to let her do
the heavy lifting.

11:00.751 --> 11:03.586
I found her wandering
the hallways with this.

11:03.588 --> 11:05.425
Just teasing. I'm the guy
who wrangles all the freaky stuff,

11:05.427 --> 11:07.460
Atticus Shane. Please,
call me Shane, I beg you.

11:07.462 --> 11:09.628
Thank you guys for helping,
I really appreciate it.

11:09.630 --> 11:13.170
Y'all get free admission
to my free exhibit.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.473
[Chuckles]

11:15.475 --> 11:17.340
Why does he look
so familiar?

11:17.342 --> 11:19.976
No idea.

11:19.978 --> 11:22.917
Hey, um, have you guys
seen Rebekah?

11:22.919 --> 11:25.486
She said she was going to help me
look into what caused the explosion

11:25.488 --> 11:28.390
at my dad's farm,
and then she just...

11:28.392 --> 11:30.361
Disappeared,
yeah, I know.

11:37.470 --> 11:40.301
- You lost her?!
- Well, "lost"

11:40.303 --> 11:42.803
is a very strong word. We just
technically don't know where she is.

11:42.805 --> 11:44.239
I'm more worried about what Klaus
said about this hunter's curse.

11:44.241 --> 11:46.843
How does Klaus even
know about this?

11:46.845 --> 11:49.245
How does Klaus know anything? The
guy's like a billion year's old.

11:49.247 --> 11:52.213
He said it was
a witch's curse.

11:52.215 --> 11:55.150
You know if I could do anything
to help, I would, but I...

11:55.152 --> 11:58.185
But nothing.
Wave your magic wand, hocus pocus,

11:58.187 --> 12:01.020
be gone, hunter,
ghostess, whatever.

12:01.022 --> 12:05.088
The spirits won't let me do the
magic I need to break the curse.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.560
But I can
ask Shane for help.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.096
He knows everything
about everything.

12:10.098 --> 12:13.064
Great. You two
do your thing.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.965
- Where you going?
- To get her back.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.966
[Elena groaning]

12:17.968 --> 12:23.333
- Let go of me!
- Certainly.

12:23.335 --> 12:25.367
I apologize
for the lack of windows.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.335
It's to preserve the art.

12:27.337 --> 12:29.771
And, of course, to prevent you
from taking off your daylight ring

12:29.773 --> 12:31.709
and burning yourself
to death in the sun.

12:31.711 --> 12:34.046
I'm not going to kill myself.
I would never do that.

12:34.048 --> 12:37.115
Oh, but you'll want to.

12:37.117 --> 12:40.387
I did.
Problem is, I'm immortal.

12:40.389 --> 12:43.086
- You went through this?
- Yes, I did.

12:43.088 --> 12:46.424
For 52 years, four months
and nine days.

12:46.426 --> 12:49.559
I was tormented...

12:49.561 --> 12:51.227
In my dreams.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.399
My every waking moment.

12:54.401 --> 12:57.537
Relentless,
never-ending torture.

12:57.539 --> 13:02.707
It was the only period of
my life when I actually felt time.

13:02.709 --> 13:06.874
So you knew that this would
happen if Connor died.

13:06.876 --> 13:08.575
That's why
you got involved.

13:08.577 --> 13:10.108
Did Stefan know, too?

13:10.110 --> 13:14.946
All he knew was that the hunter
had to be kept alive.

13:14.948 --> 13:17.549
You should have listened to him when
he said he had it covered, love.

13:17.551 --> 13:20.253
What else
does Stefan know?

13:20.255 --> 13:23.890
Well, that's one of life's
little mysteries, isn't it?

13:23.892 --> 13:26.858
How did you
make it stop?

13:28.628 --> 13:30.661
[Sighs]

13:30.663 --> 13:32.461
I didn't.

13:34.165 --> 13:36.100
Eventually it just stopped.

13:38.167 --> 13:41.664
The hallucinations
tend to appear

13:41.666 --> 13:43.767
in strange forms.

13:45.938 --> 13:49.668
Don't say I didn't warn you.

13:53.607 --> 13:56.343
He's got Elena. I need Tyler
to get the other hybrids away

13:56.345 --> 13:58.745
so I can get her out.

13:58.747 --> 14:01.047
I know I'm probably
asking the impossible, but...

14:01.049 --> 14:03.548
Actually...

14:03.550 --> 14:06.551
You're not.

14:06.553 --> 14:09.089
Haley is the one that helped
me break the sire bond.

14:09.091 --> 14:12.389
She showed me what to do.
How to help.

14:12.391 --> 14:15.157
When she showed up here,
I thought it was just coincidence.

14:15.159 --> 14:17.358
But it turns out she's
been helping one of them.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.560
Her friend Chris.

14:19.562 --> 14:21.928
And she came to help us

14:21.930 --> 14:24.463
get the rest of them
out from under Klaus.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.134
So...

14:28.136 --> 14:32.471
Are you telling me
that Chris isn't sired anymore?

14:32.473 --> 14:35.242
That's exactly what
he's telling you.

14:38.046 --> 14:40.314
Clothes, toothbrush.

14:40.316 --> 14:42.617
Klaus said
you're going to be here

14:42.619 --> 14:44.353
until he figures out
where to put you.

14:44.355 --> 14:46.388
Just please go away.

14:47.890 --> 14:49.790
I can't.

14:49.792 --> 14:51.993
I'm going to be
with you forever.

14:51.995 --> 14:54.996
A constant reminder
of what you've become.

14:54.998 --> 14:57.529
So tell me.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.832
How did it feel to drain
the life out of me?

14:59.834 --> 15:02.336
It was horrible.

15:02.338 --> 15:04.670
It was the worst thing
that I've ever done.

15:04.672 --> 15:07.373
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.242
Yes, you are.
Tell the truth.

15:09.244 --> 15:11.544
- I am telling the truth.
- You're lying.

15:11.546 --> 15:14.113
Fine! I liked it.
I loved the taste of your blood.

15:14.115 --> 15:18.017
- Are you happy?
- I'm not happy, Elena.

15:18.019 --> 15:20.883
I'm dead.

15:20.885 --> 15:22.851
Did you know I had a family?

15:22.853 --> 15:26.455
A brother?

15:26.457 --> 15:28.020
Parents.

15:28.022 --> 15:30.755
I'm sorry.

15:30.757 --> 15:33.426
I'm really sorry.

15:33.428 --> 15:36.527
Are you sorry
about your parents?

15:36.529 --> 15:39.699
- It's your fault they died.
- Don't.

15:39.701 --> 15:41.734
They ran off wickery bridge
with you in the car,

15:41.736 --> 15:43.367
but they weren't supposed
to be there, were they?

15:43.369 --> 15:45.600
They died because of you.

15:45.602 --> 15:47.435
You know I'm not going to stop

15:47.437 --> 15:51.840
until you've taken
your last miserable breath.

15:51.842 --> 15:54.039
I'm not going to let you
do this to me.

15:54.041 --> 15:55.574
[Laughs]

15:55.576 --> 15:57.644
Then get rid of me.

15:57.646 --> 15:59.678
Kill yourself.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.377
You never wanted to be
a vampire in the first place.

16:01.379 --> 16:03.978
Now look at what
you've become.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.814
You're a monster.

16:05.816 --> 16:07.616
And you deserve to die.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.650
You don't want
to listen to me?

16:09.652 --> 16:13.222
Fine.

16:13.224 --> 16:16.392
Then how about you and I
have a little chat.

16:16.394 --> 16:18.326
Katherine?

16:18.328 --> 16:21.164
Did you miss me?

16:27.616 --> 16:29.239
You're looking at
what people believe to be

16:29.241 --> 16:30.808
the world's first tombstone.

16:30.810 --> 16:34.544
This item was donated to
Whitmore college last month.

16:34.546 --> 16:36.411
Oh, I just remembered
how I know him.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.879
Through my dad.

16:37.881 --> 16:39.647
That guy knew
your dad?

16:39.649 --> 16:43.584
Yeah. He taught a theology
seminar at Whitmore last year.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.385
...belonged to a very
powerful witch.

16:45.387 --> 16:48.585
A witch so powerful, in fact,
that Silas... That was his name...

16:48.587 --> 16:52.589
Created a spell
that would grant him...

16:52.591 --> 16:55.158
Immortality.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.627
Now legend says that Silas did the
spell with the help of a lady witch

16:58.629 --> 17:02.195
who loved him,
a woman named Qetsiyah.

17:02.197 --> 17:05.364
Sadly for Qetsiyah,
Silas wanted

17:05.366 --> 17:08.134
to give immortality
to another woman.

17:08.136 --> 17:11.604
So Qetsiyah killed her
and buried Silas alive,

17:11.606 --> 17:14.273
leaving him powerless,

17:14.276 --> 17:17.810
immortal, and alone.

17:17.811 --> 17:19.377
This might actually
be the origin story

17:19.380 --> 17:22.681
of hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

17:22.683 --> 17:26.484
- You got this?
- Yeah. I'll bring him to you.

17:26.487 --> 17:30.656
Now it's said that Silas
wants to rise again.

17:30.658 --> 17:33.261
Regain his power.

17:33.263 --> 17:35.101
Wreak   on the world.

17:37.364 --> 17:39.297
Maybe we should be afraid.

17:42.203 --> 17:45.003
Or maybe it's all a bunch of
crap and that's just an old rock.

17:45.005 --> 17:46.806
[Laughter]

17:46.808 --> 17:48.475
All right, listen,
enjoy exploring the exhibit.

17:48.477 --> 17:50.611
I'll be around
to answer any questions.

17:50.613 --> 17:52.046
Thank you for coming.

17:52.048 --> 17:53.850
Hey. You made it.

17:53.852 --> 17:55.220
Nice cautionary tale.

17:55.222 --> 17:56.820
Qetsiyah sounds like a bad ass.

17:56.822 --> 17:58.487
Nothing compared
to Silas.

17:58.489 --> 17:59.755
Hmm.

17:59.757 --> 18:02.960
Ugh, don't you ever
stop crying?

18:02.962 --> 18:05.895
Poor Elena,
always the victim.

18:05.897 --> 18:08.767
Except now you're a killer.

18:08.769 --> 18:11.702
What does Stefan think
of the new you?

18:11.704 --> 18:13.469
Shut up.

18:13.471 --> 18:17.275
The girl he fell in love with
is gone, you know.

18:17.277 --> 18:19.943
You're like me now.
Maybe worse.

18:19.945 --> 18:21.676
I made a mistake.
I can do better.

18:21.678 --> 18:23.311
No. You can't.

18:23.313 --> 18:25.716
You're a vampire.
You'll kill again.

18:25.718 --> 18:28.418
It'll change you,
and it'll keep changing you

18:28.420 --> 18:29.853
until you're just like me.

18:29.855 --> 18:31.956
I am nothing like you.

18:31.958 --> 18:35.123
I was you before you
even existed.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.026
And when Stefan
knew the real me...

18:38.028 --> 18:39.730
He hated me.

18:41.734 --> 18:43.302
Now he's going
to hate you, too.

18:43.304 --> 18:45.905
Well, at least
you still have Damon.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.441
Shut up!

18:47.443 --> 18:50.384
[Grunting and gasping]

19:04.695 --> 19:07.062
[Chuckles]

19:08.264 --> 19:10.133
Ahh.

19:11.502 --> 19:14.239
You're missing
all the adventure, pal.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.408
Shane, this is
my friend Damon.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.677
He's kind of an expert
on this stuff, too.

19:23.679 --> 19:26.510
I audited your class.
It's very enlightening.

19:26.512 --> 19:28.977
That's right,
I remember you.

19:28.979 --> 19:31.047
What's your specialty?

19:31.049 --> 19:33.549
The origin of the species.

19:33.551 --> 19:36.618
Oh, I think Darwin would arm
wrestle you for that distinction.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.420
Not that species.

19:38.422 --> 19:40.922
You're into
the monster stuff.

19:40.924 --> 19:43.056
All right, awesome.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.790
I was kind of hoping
that you might have

19:44.792 --> 19:47.759
stumbled upon this
at some point...

19:47.761 --> 19:50.160
Maybe.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.795
This is the hunter's mark.
Where did you get this?

19:55.797 --> 19:58.064
Came to me in a dream.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.864
You know anything
about the hunter's curse?

19:59.866 --> 20:02.234
Why, you got a dead
hunter in the trunk

20:02.236 --> 20:04.405
of your car
or something?

20:04.407 --> 20:06.408
Metaphorically speaking.

20:08.510 --> 20:10.276
[Exhales]

20:10.278 --> 20:12.980
Legend says that
if a hunter

20:12.982 --> 20:15.182
is killed by that
which it hunts,

20:15.184 --> 20:17.182
then that person

20:17.184 --> 20:20.350
will be cursed to walk the earth
and torment them till...

20:20.352 --> 20:21.786
Until...

20:21.788 --> 20:23.121
Until a new hunter's
awakened

20:23.123 --> 20:26.156
and their legacy's
passed on.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.757
They're called
"potentials".

20:27.759 --> 20:29.225
Listen, I have a bunch
of research on it,

20:29.227 --> 20:30.327
why don't I go
grab it for you.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.829
That would be great.
Hey, thanks.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.541
How are we supposed to
find a potential hunter?

20:39.543 --> 20:42.211
Yeah, about that...

20:42.213 --> 20:45.682
Little Gilbert.

20:45.684 --> 20:48.586
Your services are needed.

20:49.390 --> 20:51.257
Thanks for meeting us.

20:51.259 --> 20:54.163
Yeah, well, make it fast.
Klaus will be back soon.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.465
No, he won't.

20:57.567 --> 20:59.500
[Music playing]

20:59.502 --> 21:03.703
Place looks pretty good considering
your hybrid got blown up in it.

21:03.705 --> 21:06.305
Caroline.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.143
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

21:09.145 --> 21:11.210
I want you
to give Elena back.

21:11.212 --> 21:12.677
Ahh.

21:12.679 --> 21:15.310
They sent you to sweet talk me.

21:15.312 --> 21:17.814
Well, good form,
but I'm afraid I can't do it.

21:17.816 --> 21:18.783
Why not?

21:18.784 --> 21:21.115
She needs my help.
[Scoffs]

21:21.117 --> 21:23.382
Look, I'm not going to burden
you with the gory details.

21:23.384 --> 21:25.285
I know you have enough
on your plate already.

21:25.287 --> 21:27.687
That's none of your
business, actually.

21:27.689 --> 21:32.522
Yes, well, just know that if
Tyler was still sired to me,

21:32.524 --> 21:35.326
he never would have hurt you.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.493
I wouldn't have let him.

21:41.096 --> 21:44.308
Can I at least
offer you a drink?

21:45.999 --> 21:48.498
Yeah.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.501
Thanks.

21:50.503 --> 21:53.003
All you need to do is
give me access to Elena

21:53.005 --> 21:56.037
- and I'll take it from there.
- Please, man.

21:56.039 --> 21:59.374
Help us, and then you can
disappear. You'll be free.

21:59.376 --> 22:01.710
Yeah, until Klaus sends one
of his other hybrids after me.

22:01.712 --> 22:03.579
Haley and I got
your back.

22:03.581 --> 22:06.515
We'll make sure
nothing happens.

22:09.152 --> 22:13.055
Katherine: You were such a good
girl when you were a human.

22:13.057 --> 22:15.957
Always willing to sacrifice
yourself for your friends.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.630
Except, weren't they usually the
ones that ended up getting hurt?

22:19.632 --> 22:21.366
I never wanted that.

22:21.368 --> 22:23.901
Bonnie lost her grams
because of you.

22:23.903 --> 22:26.874
Her mom almost turned
into a vampire because of you.

22:26.876 --> 22:29.575
You know, she probably
secretly hates you.

22:29.577 --> 22:31.911
Did you ever think of that?

22:31.913 --> 22:33.514
I bet she'd be relieved
if you were gone.

22:33.516 --> 22:35.050
I'm not going
to kill myself.

22:35.052 --> 22:37.851
Why not?
Your very existence

22:37.853 --> 22:39.752
brings people
nothing but pain.

22:39.754 --> 22:41.821
I mean, maybe it was
worth it when you were worth it.

22:41.823 --> 22:43.223
But you're nothing now.

22:43.225 --> 22:46.824
You're a monster, Elena.
You deserve to die.

22:46.826 --> 22:49.165
[Gasping]

22:50.360 --> 22:52.096
Klaus said you two
have to go to Tyler.

22:52.098 --> 22:54.332
Why? Something about
his girl Caroline.

22:54.334 --> 22:57.297
I'll take over here.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.082
Elena.

23:15.084 --> 23:16.451
No!

23:16.453 --> 23:17.686
Hey.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.653
No, no, no.

23:20.655 --> 23:21.821
Hey, it's me.

23:21.823 --> 23:23.759
No, stay...
Stay away from me.

23:23.761 --> 23:26.195
Let me help you.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.398
No, Elena, stop!

23:28.400 --> 23:31.337
[Grunting
and groaning]

23:40.506 --> 23:42.273
How did I not know any of
this stuff about Jeremy?

23:42.275 --> 23:43.741
The witch who loses her powers

23:43.743 --> 23:45.811
get left out
of the important conversations.

23:45.813 --> 23:47.646
Is everything ok?!
Is it Elena?

23:47.648 --> 23:49.647
We figured out
how to help her.

23:49.649 --> 23:51.883
You need to kill
a vampire.

23:51.885 --> 23:54.120
Oh, great. Give me a stake.
I'll kill Damon right now.

23:54.122 --> 23:56.488
Easy, van Helsing.
We'll get you one.

23:56.490 --> 23:58.123
- Don't worry.
- Before you do this,

23:58.125 --> 24:00.292
you need to know what you're
getting yourself into.

24:00.294 --> 24:01.991
You can rest easy, brother.

24:01.993 --> 24:04.426
We figured out how to solve
our little Elena problem.

24:04.428 --> 24:06.428
[Grunts] Yeah, well,

24:06.430 --> 24:08.797
now we have a bigger
one. I lost her.

24:08.799 --> 24:12.767
- What? Again?
- She's in bad shape.

24:12.769 --> 24:15.704
I tried to help her,
but she attacked me.

24:15.706 --> 24:19.474
Listen, you go find her, all right?
Talk her down. She'll listen to you.

24:19.476 --> 24:20.943
[Panting]

24:20.945 --> 24:24.945
Just tell me what I need
to do to end this.

24:24.947 --> 24:27.515
[Music playing]

24:30.154 --> 24:32.300
[Giggles]

24:33.388 --> 24:35.990
So here's the thing.

24:35.992 --> 24:38.192
I didn't just
come here

24:38.194 --> 24:40.659
to try to get you
to release Elena.

24:40.661 --> 24:41.961
You don't say.

24:41.963 --> 24:44.298
I came here
to distract you

24:44.300 --> 24:47.036
so that Stefan could go to
your house and break her out,

24:47.038 --> 24:49.872
which he did.
And don't get mad,

24:49.874 --> 24:52.640
but then he lost her.

24:52.642 --> 24:54.644
- Klaus!
- Caroline.

24:54.646 --> 24:57.782
You're beautiful, but if you don't
stop talking, I will kill you.

24:57.784 --> 25:00.352
They figured out how to
stop the hallucinations.

25:04.358 --> 25:06.061
Ok.

25:06.063 --> 25:08.995
You have 10 seconds
to tell me.

25:08.997 --> 25:11.298
Elena: I was ready to die!

25:11.300 --> 25:12.668
Connor:
You're a monster.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.169
Katherine:
You'll kill again.

25:14.171 --> 25:16.703
Elena: I don't want
to be a vampire!

25:16.705 --> 25:18.505
Are you ready to die yet?

25:18.507 --> 25:20.206
You know it's your only
way out of this.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.241
You can't take back
what you did.

25:21.243 --> 25:23.641
It can never be undone.

25:23.643 --> 25:26.577
You're a monster
and you deserve to die.

25:56.934 --> 26:00.102
It's ok, sweetie.

26:01.071 --> 26:03.576
Mom?

26:06.212 --> 26:09.546
I know what
you're going through.

26:11.148 --> 26:13.884
And it's ok.

26:13.886 --> 26:15.920
This bridge is...

26:15.922 --> 26:20.026
Where your life
should have ended.

26:20.028 --> 26:21.929
Not just once,
but twice.

26:21.931 --> 26:24.398
You were ready
to die, remember?

26:26.835 --> 26:31.574
- I don't know what to do.
- Yes, you do, honey.

26:31.576 --> 26:34.109
You know exactly
what to do.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.083
That's right.

26:49.353 --> 26:53.122
The sun will come up
and this will all be over.

26:54.957 --> 27:00.028
It's the right thing to do, Elena.
You know it is.

27:00.030 --> 27:01.829
Admit it.

27:04.032 --> 27:07.268
Because I'm a monster.

27:08.937 --> 27:13.606
And I deserve to die.

27:31.110 --> 27:34.113
[breathing heavily]

27:39.383 --> 27:42.386
I can't do this.

27:42.388 --> 27:45.022
I can't leave Jeremy.

27:45.024 --> 27:48.156
Jeremy is better off without you.
Don't you see that?

27:48.158 --> 27:51.195
- But mom, he won't have anyone!
- He'll have you.

27:51.197 --> 27:52.932
You'll be a ghost
who helps him,

27:52.934 --> 27:55.533
not a monster
who hurts him.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.271
You're... you're right.

28:01.273 --> 28:05.741
I... I...

28:05.743 --> 28:08.243
I'm sorry.

28:10.112 --> 28:13.446
Mommy, I didn't mean
to disappoint you.

28:13.448 --> 28:15.149
Ohh.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.751
You didn't.

28:16.753 --> 28:20.420
You were everything
I ever wanted you to be.

28:20.422 --> 28:23.056
But you died.

28:24.558 --> 28:27.764
And you were supposed
to stay dead.

28:27.766 --> 28:31.335
Elena.

28:31.337 --> 28:34.107
Damon?

28:34.109 --> 28:35.944
[Gasps]

28:38.714 --> 28:42.215
How... how did you
find me?

28:42.217 --> 28:44.486
Didn't take a genius
to figure it out.

28:44.488 --> 28:46.853
The third time's a charm?

28:50.494 --> 28:53.031
You were right, Damon.

28:53.033 --> 28:56.970
Vampires kill people.

28:56.972 --> 29:00.504
And Stefan
was right, too.

29:00.506 --> 29:05.040
I can't live
with myself.

29:05.042 --> 29:07.709
Look at you.

29:07.711 --> 29:10.177
Being all glass is half empty.

29:10.179 --> 29:12.778
Let's just go talk about this
before you do something stupid.

29:12.780 --> 29:13.811
Ok?

29:13.813 --> 29:16.513
Connor: The sun
will be up soon.

29:17.848 --> 29:20.047
It's almost over.

29:30.823 --> 29:34.527
Where's your ring?

29:34.529 --> 29:35.928
Where's your ring, Elena?

29:35.930 --> 29:37.961
You're doing
a good thing, Chris.

29:37.963 --> 29:40.198
Yeah, well, let's see how fast a
good thing could get me out of town.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.400
Call me when
you're safe, ok?

29:42.402 --> 29:44.669
Yeah.

29:53.047 --> 29:55.614
Going somewhere?

29:55.616 --> 29:59.150
When I said don't let her
out of your sight,

29:59.152 --> 30:01.221
- what did you think I meant?
- It's not his fault!

30:01.223 --> 30:03.157
It's mine. I was
distracting him.

30:03.159 --> 30:04.526
It's my fault
she got away!

30:04.528 --> 30:06.162
And maybe you should be
the one to die for it.

30:06.164 --> 30:10.402
- No one has to die!
- Did I not say mind your business?!

30:10.404 --> 30:12.204
Tyler's covering for me.

30:12.206 --> 30:14.074
- I'm the one that let her go.
- Haley...

30:14.076 --> 30:18.548
No. You want someone dead,
go ahead. Kill me.

30:18.550 --> 30:21.218
I'd rather die anyway
then end up as one

30:21.220 --> 30:22.886
of your sired little bitches.

30:22.888 --> 30:26.188
Don't tempt me,
little wolf.

30:30.893 --> 30:35.128
Your existence is to serve me.

30:35.130 --> 30:37.528
To please me.

30:37.530 --> 30:40.098
Do you understand?

30:40.100 --> 30:42.802
I'm sorry.
I won't fail you again.

30:42.804 --> 30:44.902
No. You won't.

30:46.738 --> 30:48.741
Get out of here.

30:54.217 --> 30:55.886
[Grunts]
No!

31:00.254 --> 31:01.386
Jeremy?!

31:01.388 --> 31:02.887
We need to get you inside.

31:02.889 --> 31:05.325
It's almost time.

31:05.327 --> 31:07.861
What you're going through
is a curse.

31:07.863 --> 31:10.463
We know how to break it,
we just have to get you inside!

31:10.465 --> 31:12.468
Don't let him stop you.

31:12.470 --> 31:15.971
I know you want to.
But you can't.

31:15.973 --> 31:17.638
Don't.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.274
Damn it, Elena!

31:21.645 --> 31:24.245
What the hell, man?!

31:24.247 --> 31:26.246
I'm sorry.

31:28.317 --> 31:30.487
[Screams]

31:42.102 --> 31:43.336
He's gone.

31:43.338 --> 31:45.840
It's ok.

31:53.849 --> 31:55.817
Damon?

32:05.857 --> 32:08.658
[music playing]

32:16.102 --> 32:19.570
Fished it out of
the river for you.

32:19.572 --> 32:20.874
Little tip...

32:20.876 --> 32:23.043
Vampires hate to swim.

32:24.579 --> 32:26.112
How you feeling?

32:26.114 --> 32:29.517
My head's clear.

32:29.519 --> 32:32.589
I can remember everything,
but not like I lived it.

32:32.591 --> 32:35.859
Like it was a really bad dream.

32:37.731 --> 32:40.267
You saved me.

32:42.236 --> 32:44.337
Thank you.

32:44.339 --> 32:48.912
Well, you know what
they say about teenage suicide.

32:48.914 --> 32:51.714
Don't do it.

32:51.716 --> 32:55.054
- I just can't believe that I almost...
- You weren't yourself.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.990
Yeah, but if it wasn't
for you...

33:06.163 --> 33:08.963
[Sighs]

33:10.532 --> 33:14.437
I'm about to take
a very...

33:14.439 --> 33:17.970
High and annoying road

33:17.972 --> 33:22.275
and tell you something.

33:22.277 --> 33:25.609
Because I know that you think
Stefan's been lying to you.

33:25.611 --> 33:28.880
Which, yeah. He has.

33:28.882 --> 33:33.051
But this... rough patch that you
two have been going through,

33:33.053 --> 33:36.957
it's not what you think.

33:36.959 --> 33:40.361
Everything that he's been doing,
he's been doing for you.

33:40.363 --> 33:42.563
To help you.

33:42.565 --> 33:44.134
And after he kills me
for telling you this,

33:44.136 --> 33:47.007
I want you to throw my ashes
off of wickery bridge, ok?

33:47.009 --> 33:48.809
[Chuckles]

33:50.177 --> 33:53.880
There may be a way out
of this for you, Elena.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.451
There may be a cure.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.619
[Music playing]

34:09.025 --> 34:11.126
Tyler.

34:15.502 --> 34:17.702
[Sighs] It's just us.

34:17.704 --> 34:21.304
Paying our respects
to Chris.

34:26.476 --> 34:28.876
Tyler... we didn't
have a choice.

34:28.878 --> 34:31.978
I told him
we had his back.

34:31.981 --> 34:35.379
I told him if he helped us,
he'd be free.

34:35.380 --> 34:37.147
We needed to help our friend.

34:37.149 --> 34:39.385
Yeah, we helped our friend by
handing over another friend.

34:39.387 --> 34:41.386
- Chris wasn't...
- Chris was a friend,

34:41.388 --> 34:44.958
Caroline. He's like me.
He's part of my pack.

34:44.960 --> 34:51.397
All he wanted to do was be unsired
by that disgusting piece of...

34:51.399 --> 34:54.167
[Exhales]

34:56.371 --> 35:01.439
How did you even get Klaus to agree
to give up one of his hybrids?

35:04.242 --> 35:07.943
I agreed to go on
a date with him.

35:14.385 --> 35:18.686
I just thought that it might help keep
up the ruse between you and Haley.

35:22.658 --> 35:25.361
What the hell
is going on?

35:25.363 --> 35:29.365
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

35:29.367 --> 35:33.632
Just celebrating the life
of a fallen hybrid friend.

35:36.201 --> 35:39.371
Bourbon.

35:42.610 --> 35:45.579
Make that two.

35:47.446 --> 35:50.383
Still saving a spot
for Mr. Saltzman, huh?

35:50.385 --> 35:54.421
I'd say I'm in the market
for a new drinking buddy.

35:54.423 --> 35:55.989
You're not qualified.

35:55.991 --> 35:57.456
I know that you don't like me.

35:57.458 --> 35:58.892
Heh.

35:58.894 --> 36:00.859
But I dug up some stuff
about the explosion

36:00.861 --> 36:04.994
at the Young farm that I kind
of need to tell someone about.

36:07.198 --> 36:10.201
So April mentioned that her dad
knew that professor Shane guy.

36:10.203 --> 36:14.805
Which wouldn't be creepy, except he had
all that info about the hunter's curse.

36:14.807 --> 36:17.644
And we live in a town
where, you know, anybody

36:17.646 --> 36:21.210
who knows stuff is creepy
until proven otherwise.

36:21.212 --> 36:24.815
You're on the verge of
impressing me. Drive it home.

36:24.817 --> 36:27.283
I got the sheriff to dig up
the pastor's phone records.

36:27.285 --> 36:30.485
Turns out, he made like
a call a day

36:30.487 --> 36:32.552
to the same number
the last month he was alive.

36:32.554 --> 36:35.355
And on the day the council
got blown up at the farm,

36:35.357 --> 36:38.658
he called it ten times.

36:38.660 --> 36:41.794
The office of professor
Atticus Shane.

36:41.796 --> 36:44.531
Did your, uh,
did your friend Damon,

36:44.533 --> 36:47.301
did he get everything
he was looking for in my files?

36:47.303 --> 36:49.269
Yeah. Thanks.

36:49.271 --> 36:51.306
I, um...

36:51.308 --> 36:55.472
I have to ask,
how do you know all this stuff?

36:55.474 --> 36:58.208
Bonnie...

36:58.210 --> 37:00.112
[Exhales]

37:00.114 --> 37:02.946
I have been around
the world ten times over.

37:02.948 --> 37:05.347
I've studied every supernatural
creature known to man.

37:05.349 --> 37:07.417
And for the record,

37:07.419 --> 37:10.152
witches are hands down
the most powerful,

37:10.154 --> 37:11.953
so I'm in your corner
all the way,

37:11.955 --> 37:14.155
I'm your biggest ally.

37:14.157 --> 37:18.128
But let me just say
one thing.

37:18.130 --> 37:22.196
When your new hunter,
and I know you have one...

37:24.233 --> 37:26.335
When he completes his mark,

37:26.337 --> 37:30.403
you're going to want
to come to me.

37:30.405 --> 37:32.139
'Cause I'm going to be
the only one who can help.

37:32.141 --> 37:36.144
Trust me on that, ok?

37:36.146 --> 37:38.511
The only one.

37:42.017 --> 37:44.418
[Clears throat]

37:44.420 --> 37:47.152
I'm sorry that I stabbed you.

37:47.154 --> 37:53.696
[Chuckles] No, it's all right.
I probably deserved it.

37:53.698 --> 37:55.230
So, um...

37:55.232 --> 37:59.334
Damon told me that
he clued you in.

37:59.336 --> 38:01.069
You didn't kill him, did you?

38:01.071 --> 38:05.071
Nah, screw the lies
and the secrets.

38:05.073 --> 38:06.842
We all want the same thing.

38:06.844 --> 38:10.448
We just have to work
together for it.

38:15.253 --> 38:18.189
Stefan...

38:19.459 --> 38:21.929
Why did you send Damon

38:21.931 --> 38:24.367
to come look for me
instead of you?

38:26.037 --> 38:29.837
I sent him
because lately...

38:29.839 --> 38:33.108
It seems like he's able
to get through to you

38:33.110 --> 38:36.277
in ways that I can't.

38:36.279 --> 38:37.644
You listen to him.

38:37.646 --> 38:40.348
You trust him.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.050
Even when
you can't trust me.

38:42.052 --> 38:44.183
- I didn't mean to not...
- Come on, Elena.

38:44.185 --> 38:48.387
I mean, after everything
that we've been through...

38:48.389 --> 38:50.222
[Chuckles]

38:51.791 --> 38:53.824
You can admit it.

39:03.901 --> 39:07.303
You have been so strong for me.

39:07.305 --> 39:09.870
Helping me.

39:09.872 --> 39:11.904
Fighting for that girl
that chose you.

39:11.906 --> 39:14.873
The girl that I was
when I died on the bridge.

39:14.875 --> 39:17.942
And I love you so much
for wanting to find this cure,

39:17.944 --> 39:22.245
because I'd like nothing more
than to get her back.

39:22.247 --> 39:26.479
Because the...
The girl that she's become...

39:28.450 --> 39:31.019
That...

39:31.021 --> 39:34.523
That I've become,

39:34.525 --> 39:37.161
is different.

39:37.163 --> 39:40.300
Somehow.

39:40.302 --> 39:42.701
Darker. I...

39:42.703 --> 39:47.710
- Who I am, what I want...
- <i>What</i> you want?

39:47.712 --> 39:51.181
Or... who you want?

39:56.723 --> 39:59.523
Something's changed...

39:59.525 --> 40:03.799
Between Damon and me.

40:03.801 --> 40:06.734
Much more than
it ever used to be.

40:06.736 --> 40:09.539
It's like...

40:09.541 --> 40:12.144
It's like everything
that I felt for him

40:12.146 --> 40:14.645
before I was a vampire...

40:14.647 --> 40:15.878
It's been magnified.

40:15.880 --> 40:20.354
Your feelings for him
have been magnified.

40:27.395 --> 40:29.895
I'm sorry.

40:31.498 --> 40:35.599
I don't want to lie to you.

40:35.601 --> 40:39.035
[Sighs]

40:39.037 --> 40:41.804
You know, before, when I was the,
uh... [clears throat]

40:41.806 --> 40:46.470
The ripper...
[Chuckles]

40:46.472 --> 40:50.241
I understood
why you cared for him.

40:51.577 --> 40:55.117
I mean, I practically
drove you to it.

40:55.119 --> 40:58.054
But now...

41:02.627 --> 41:05.865
I can't do this, Elena.

41:08.936 --> 41:12.440
Not anymore.

41:17.246 --> 41:20.119
I know.
