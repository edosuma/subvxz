WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:05.831
Carrie.
I saved you a spot.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.660
Hey, Frank.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.502
You ready to watch
your Major Crimes runner
get beat?

00:09.590 --> 00:10.909
You know,
you're a glutton
for punishment.

00:11.050 --> 00:12.165
Every year you come here

00:12.260 --> 00:14.171
expecting the 44th to win,
and every year you lose.

00:14.260 --> 00:16.171
Last year, your runner
came in what, 19th?

00:16.260 --> 00:18.308
With a running time
of 27 minutes 9 seconds.

00:18.430 --> 00:21.228
Year before that,
your runner came in 25th,
which sucked!

00:21.310 --> 00:23.938
All right.
Care to put your money where
your mouth is, memory queen?

00:24.020 --> 00:26.147
Okay. 100 bucks.
All right, done.
You got it.

00:26.270 --> 00:27.259
Done.
Here's my guy now.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.469
And he's in the lead.

00:28.610 --> 00:30.146
Go, Jay! Go, Jay!
Go, Jay! Go!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.487
Let's go, Bobby!
Let's go!
Whoo!

00:32.610 --> 00:34.441
FRANK: Where's
he going?
ALL: Oh!

00:34.530 --> 00:36.236
Ah!

00:36.950 --> 00:38.656
JAY LEE: What?
Hey! Stop!

00:38.780 --> 00:40.532
VVhat
Come on!

00:40.620 --> 00:42.906
Are you okay?
You're all right?

00:43.910 --> 00:45.241
I was first, right?

00:45.330 --> 00:47.912
Wait. I got my head across
before you kicked your foot.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.080
You have_to cross
the line.

00:50.210 --> 00:51.370
Carrie, a little
help here.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.961
Absolutely not.
That's collusion.

00:53.050 --> 00:54.506
Don't mind ifI do.

00:59.430 --> 01:00.419
Okay, Jay,

01:00.510 --> 01:02.978
you did kick your foot
over the line as you fell.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.345
Valiant effort,
but second place.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.970
What?
Pay up, Wells.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.800
I gotta hand it to you.
You got integrity.

01:07.940 --> 01:09.316
Not so fast.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.897
You, number 78,
third place.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.231
Are you out of your mind?
And you, number 66,

01:15.320 --> 01:18.232
in a spectacular head dive
across the finish line,

01:18.320 --> 01:20.402
you won, first place.
Get your trophy.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.401
Wait, what?
How do we know
you're rIght?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.785
Basically,
I remember everything.

01:24.870 --> 01:27.202
_ I can slow it down
In my head and watch It back.

01:27.330 --> 01:28.456
But if you don't
believe me,

01:28.540 --> 01:31.998
the little girl over there
got it on her cell phone.

01:35.550 --> 01:36.619
So I guess nobody wins.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.381
It's for charity.

01:38.510 --> 01:39.750
Everybody wins.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.176
Gotta go.

01:46.350 --> 01:48.011
\_lictim's name
IS Jason RIOS.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.897
23 years old.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.430
According
to the M.E.,

01:51.520 --> 01:53.727
cause of death
is blunt force trauma
to the skull.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.605
Jay is doing background.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.020
All this for a video game.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.616
DENNY: Come on, it's not just
some video game, all right?

02:01.700 --> 02:03.281
This is Satan's Palace.

02:03.370 --> 02:05.998
Satan's Palace IV,
as a matter of fact.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.163
The greatest
video game ever.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.535
Seems a bit
much to me.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.495
No, look, these games make
billions of dollars, right?

02:12.590 --> 02:14.205
They come up
with crazy ways
to promote them.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.585
I've read about this.

02:15.710 --> 02:17.416
They, uh,
_it's an exact
replica of the game.

02:17.550 --> 02:18.926
It's like a haunted
house type thing.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.712
Looks like Jason was killed
sometime before closing.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.882
Couple of employees
were setting up
this morning,

02:24.010 --> 02:25.307
found the body.

02:25.390 --> 02:26.470
Manager's gonna come
talk to us.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.437
We got a weapon?
Take your pick.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.721
CSU blood splatter
folks gonna love this.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.516
Detectives?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.896
Thank you so much.
I'm Hannah Davis.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.852
I'm the managing director
of Hexler Gaming's
Satan's Palace IV.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.692
I'm a huge fan
of the games.

02:41.780 --> 02:42.906
I, I've played
I, II, and III,

02:43.030 --> 02:44.019
and I'm,
I'm gonna play IV.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.078
I mean, as soon as
I solve this murder.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.202
Uh, please,
let's go to my office.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.952
Do you mind
if I just, um,

02:52.080 --> 02:53.490
look around a little?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.239
Watch out for
the demons.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.852
So, how close is all of this
to the actual game?

03:19.950 --> 03:22.566
Hexler Gaming is insistent
that every aspect

03:22.660 --> 03:24.730
adhere precisely
to the game,

03:24.830 --> 03:27.321
down to set dressing
and costumes.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.287
What happened last
night is a tragedy,

03:30.370 --> 03:32.702
and we'll do everything
to help in your investigation.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.417
Let's start with
a list of employees.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.582
And do you have any record
of your guests last night?

03:36.670 --> 03:39.298
Most of them. Hardcore gamers
buy tickets in advance.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.468
Otherwise, folks just
pay cash at the door.

03:41.590 --> 03:43.672
Uh, personnel will have
the employee list.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.506
Do you have any
cameras inside?

03:45.640 --> 03:47.255
No. We don't allow
cell phone cameras either.

03:47.350 --> 03:49.261
For proprietary reasons.

03:49.350 --> 03:51.261
Anything out of the
ordinary happen lately?

03:51.350 --> 03:52.931
You know, I don't know
how relevant this is,

03:53.020 --> 03:54.931
but we've had some,
I guess you could say,

03:55.020 --> 03:56.681
protests lately.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.889
I can't imagine
the neighborhood

03:57.980 --> 03:59.811
enjoys the noise
and crowds.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.988
It wasn't the neighbors
that took issue with us.

04:02.110 --> 04:03.987
I think it was
a religious group.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.987
What were they doing?
Picketing with signs

04:06.120 --> 04:07.826
plastered with
bible quotes.

04:07.910 --> 04:09.696
Screaming about
glorifying hell.

04:09.830 --> 04:13.664
Seems they take exception
with the title of our game.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.160
You remember
the name of this group?

04:15.290 --> 04:17.702
No, but they all wore
black T-shirts...

04:17.840 --> 04:19.455
...with the letter "D."

04:19.550 --> 04:21.165
AL: All right.
We'll look into 'em.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.540
Okay.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.921
Yeah, Jay.
JAY LEE: Jason's fiancee
IS ready for you guys.

04:25.010 --> 04:26.671
Great. We'll get
down there.

04:28.510 --> 04:29.966
Thank you.

04:34.810 --> 04:37.108
It would have been
two years ago next month.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.856
We were talking about
setting a date.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.560
I don't...

04:45.110 --> 04:46.486
Who would do this?

04:46.570 --> 04:48.026
AL: We're gonna
try to find out.

04:48.660 --> 04:50.287
Anything you can tell us?

04:50.370 --> 04:52.531
Anything going on
with Jason recently?

04:52.620 --> 04:54.497
Not that I know of.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.991
I was in Milan
until three days ago.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.582
I'm in the fashion business.
I go to Europe a lot.

05:00.710 --> 05:03.008
That's where I met Jason.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.678
In Spain.
He's from Barcelona.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.967
We met on the beach
and, um...

05:17.020 --> 05:19.056
Anything with his
family bothering him?

05:19.190 --> 05:21.397
Uh, no, no family.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.100
His mother died
when he was young,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.026
and his father
wasn't in the picture.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.112
AL: Work?
GENEVIEVE:
He worked at Sistex.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.650
Big software company.

05:30.740 --> 05:34.244
And idea why Jason
was at Satan's Palace
last night?

05:34.330 --> 05:35.740
No.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.660
I didn't see him
at all yesterday.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.240
I had a lunch.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.416
I thought he was
at the office last night.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.371
I don't really get
all the computer stuff.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.461
The, uh, the games.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.676
We kind of agreed
not to talk about it.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.921
He mention any
issues with work?

05:53.060 --> 05:55.096
No. Things seemed
to be going really well.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.300
I could tell by
how much sleep he got.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.358
The last few days,
he was up almost
all night tinkering.

06:03.860 --> 06:06.442
He had_a|l his little
toys gonng at once.

06:06.530 --> 06:08.191
You know what
he was doing?

06:08.280 --> 06:11.272
Like I said,
I really don't know
much about his work.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.611
I just know that it meant
everything to him.

06:18.210 --> 06:21.373
Sometimes, um,
it would get to me.

06:24.670 --> 06:25.796
ugh, I was teasing.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.047
I... Itold him
he had to choose.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.671
Me or whatever
he was workIng on.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.017
I promise you
we're gonna do
everything we can

06:40.150 --> 06:41.469
to find who did this.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.811
Oh, yeah.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.771
All right, okay.

06:48.860 --> 06:50.657
Whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.
Go back.

06:50.740 --> 06:51.729
You found something?

06:51.820 --> 06:52.946
I think I got
something, yeah.

06:53.030 --> 06:54.531
What?
Right there.

06:54.660 --> 06:55.786
What?

06:56.660 --> 06:58.070
That guy looks
just like you.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.075
What are you,
ten years old?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.956
We got an investigation,
Denny, okay?

07:02.040 --> 07:03.917
Where are we with
that protest group?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.376
Oh, right, boss.
Yeah.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.627
So they call
themselves, get this,

07:07.710 --> 07:09.371
Dark 1.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.796
And apparently they believe
Satan reaches out

07:11.890 --> 07:15.007
to younger souls
who have been corrupted
by modern technology.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.801
Okay, modern technology
being what?

07:16.890 --> 07:19.267
I mean, basically anything,
what, after the typewriter.

07:19.350 --> 07:21.841
JAY LEE: So check
what I found out
on the head guy.

07:21.940 --> 07:24.352
Meet Reverend
Foster Lee Nolan.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.528
Now this guy was
definitely for Satan

07:26.650 --> 07:27.810
before he was
against him.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.606
Trafficking cocaine and meth.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.658
He also has a history
of taking in troubled kids
and ex-cons,

07:32.740 --> 07:36.653
and uses a combination
of ass-kicking
and old-time religion

07:36.740 --> 07:38.537
to manipulate them
for his purposes.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.655
Sounds like a nice guy.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.069
Maybe we should
go have a chat with him.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.201
DENNY: Well, boss,
we can do you one better.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.833
The good Reverend's decided
to grace us with his presence.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.002
Oh, nice.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.791
DENNY: So, what is it, you...
You object to anything

07:53.890 --> 07:57.678
even related
to the D Right?

07:58.970 --> 08:00.426
Well, what about
the New Jersey Devils?

08:01.100 --> 08:03.648
Huh?
Not a hockey fan, okay.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.971
Uh, what about
the Duke Blue Devils?

08:06.060 --> 08:07.357
The Wake Forest
Demon Deacons?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.396
You may laugh,
but what I do...

08:09.480 --> 08:11.311
This is a murder
case, Reverend.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.526
Nobody's laughing.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.366
Companies like
Hexler Gaming

08:15.450 --> 08:17.361
are billion7dollar
corporations,

08:17.450 --> 08:19.657
and they are making
millions promoting sin.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.742
It's on our screens,
and in our faces,

08:22.870 --> 08:25.031
and the public
is powerless against them,

08:25.130 --> 08:27.917
so we do what we can.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.752
AL: You say you're
powerless against them.

08:29.880 --> 08:34.089
We just recovered
these from your house,
Reverend Nolan.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.710
You don't seem
that powerless to me.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.052
What do holy men need
with weapons like these?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.436
We're commanded to use
the tools that we have.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.776
DENNY: What about
Jason Rios?

08:52.900 --> 08:53.946
Hmm?

08:54.070 --> 08:55.606
Who commanded
you to kill him?

08:57.120 --> 09:00.362
Neither me, nor my people
had anything to do
with that man's death.

09:00.450 --> 09:03.613
We believe that
all souls can be saved.

09:03.750 --> 09:04.785
Wow.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.955
Besides...

09:07.830 --> 09:09.457
We weren't _even
there last night.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.587
We were off protesting
at an establishment called

09:12.630 --> 09:15.372
Devil Burger
out in Forest Hills.

09:15.470 --> 09:18.291
Although some of our members
did drop by today

09:18.390 --> 09:20.426
when news
of the murder broke.

09:20.510 --> 09:23.559
To memorialize the blood
that Hexler Gaming
has on its hands.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.301
Wacko.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.802
You know, Nolan
is telling the truth
about that

09:27.940 --> 09:30.511
because we just got these
pictures from his place.

09:34.070 --> 09:36.140
Victim's name
IS Jason RIOS.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.565
23 years old.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.275
According to the M.E.,

09:39.370 --> 09:42.157
cause of death
is blunt force trauma
to the skull.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.406
You know, all of the
costumed ghouls

09:44.500 --> 09:45.706
that were working
at Satan's Palace,

09:45.830 --> 09:47.786
they had two zippers
on the front of their
costumes.

09:47.870 --> 09:49.667
Now this guy has none.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.746
Well, if he's not an employee,
he's not a protester,

09:51.840 --> 09:53.159
so what's he
doing there?
I don't know,

09:53.300 --> 09:55.211
but I'm gonna
find out.
All right.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.134
Lieutenant, I just turned
your anti-Satanist nut-ball

10:00.220 --> 10:01.801
over to the ATF.

10:01.890 --> 10:03.517
What about his
alibi on our case?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.380
Actually panned out.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.932
Turned out he was
at the Devil Burger

10:08.020 --> 10:10.181
with his people
all night in Queens.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.561
So we're back
at square one.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.022
Would I just bring you
in here for bad news?

10:14.150 --> 10:17.199
Um, yeah. You do it
all the time.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.696
Not this time.

10:18.820 --> 10:22.529
We ran facial recognition
on that zombie party crasher.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.190
You know, the one
with no zipper?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.992
95% match with
Daniel Lebenstrom, 28.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.707
Guy's already
in the system

10:30.830 --> 10:33.742
for aggravated
assault, robbery.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.165
We'll go get him.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.330
You might wan
t to know something
else about Lebenstrom.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.627
His last robbery...

10:39.720 --> 10:42.712
Stolen body parts,
NYU medical school.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.209
Happy Halloween.

10:49.350 --> 10:51.762
(MUFFLED HEAW METAL
MUSIC PLAYING)

10:58.200 --> 11:00.486
Police. Open up.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.279
Police! Don't move!

11:12.420 --> 11:13.739
Hey, hey!
Come here!

11:16.340 --> 11:17.910
Sir?

11:18.050 --> 11:19.335
I'm Detective Lee
with Major Crimes.

11:19.420 --> 11:21.217
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

11:22.180 --> 11:23.135
You all right, sir?
You okay?

11:23.260 --> 11:25.922
That was...

11:26.010 --> 11:27.466
...awesome!

11:28.930 --> 11:30.056
The best!

11:30.890 --> 11:33.267
I'm not paying for
the NYPD bust, though.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.349
I didn't order that.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.146
You paid for this?

11:37.780 --> 11:39.179
Of course, he paid.

11:40.150 --> 11:41.230
I earn a living doing this.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.947
No laws
have been broken.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.776
A couple of laws
of nature.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.078
So what are you?
Some kind of _a
scare dominatrix?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.617
I'm more comfortable
with the term "Thanatophile."

11:50.710 --> 11:53.417
Someone who gets off on,
uh, experiencing terror,

11:53.500 --> 11:55.456
or, you know,
inflicting it on others.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.871
Not gonna ask
how you know that.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.166
You know how
I know that.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.790
There's no greater thrill
than the knowledge

11:59.880 --> 12:01.620
_ of one's own
Imminent death.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.961
What about the knowledge
of one's imminent ass

12:04.050 --> 12:05.426
being thrown in jail?

12:06.350 --> 12:07.886
So, uh,

12:09.600 --> 12:11.636
you got paid
for trespassing too?

12:15.060 --> 12:18.223
A man was murdered there.
Like, really murdered.
Not pretend.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.642
So, you were there getting off
on your imminent death, right?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.651
And all of a sudden,
what's better than
imminent death?

12:23.740 --> 12:25.480
Actua_| death.
We getting closer,
Daniel?

12:25.620 --> 12:28.157
No, okay. I was
there last night,

12:28.240 --> 12:31.448
and yes, I did enjoy
terrifying the crowds,

12:31.540 --> 12:35.374
but I had my eyes
on a bigger prize.
Hexler.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.034
Lisa Hexler.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.956
The president
of Hexler Gaming?

12:40.050 --> 12:42.120
The queen of horror games.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.710
I thought, someone like me,

12:43.840 --> 12:46.001
Lisa Hexler could
probably use my ideas.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.755
I figured she's
launching a new game.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.556
At some point,
she'll show up.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.920
So you were stalking her.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.840
I... I wanted
to pitch her.

12:54.020 --> 12:57.979
I've got a way
_to turn_what I do
into a Video game.

12:58.060 --> 13:01.143
The only problem,
Satan's Palace costs
50 bucks to get in.

13:01.230 --> 13:03.733
Ithought
you made a living
as a... Whatever.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.691
The economy.

13:05.780 --> 13:07.941
Personal ter_ror's
the first thing
people cut out.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.447
Anyhow, about a month ago
I had an idea.

13:12.540 --> 13:14.531
I put on an old
Comic-Con outfit,

13:14.620 --> 13:16.702
and found the employee's
entrance and I was in.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.416
I went back a lot,
looking for her, but nothing.

13:19.540 --> 13:23.044
And then suddenly,
last night, there she is.

13:23.130 --> 13:25.872
I followed her,
but I lost her

13:25.970 --> 13:27.380
when she went into
the Gold Room.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.636
I'm in the fashion business.
I go to Europe a lot.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.723
That's where
I met Jason. In Spain.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.721
Tell me more
about the Gold Room.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.680
It's the VIP room
at Satan's Palace.

13:40.770 --> 13:44.024
I hear Lisa has parties,
meetings there,
stuff like that.

13:44.110 --> 13:45.600
And then what?
You saw the news.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.401
There'd been a murder,
you figured Lisa Hexler's

13:47.530 --> 13:49.316
gonna show up
at the crime scene,
and you went back?

13:49.410 --> 13:51.196
CARRIE: Assuming you
didn't happen to be there

13:51.280 --> 13:53.077
'cause you'd just
murdered Jason.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.248
I... I had a client.

13:55.330 --> 13:57.207
The session ran long.

13:57.290 --> 13:58.746
This client have a name?

13:59.830 --> 14:01.240
Um...

14:03.920 --> 14:05.581
You might
recognize the name.

14:07.220 --> 14:08.460
A Congressman?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.340
Can we talk?

14:15.640 --> 14:19.053
Listen, I think Jason
met with Lisa Hexler

14:19.150 --> 14:21.106
in the Gold Room
at 8:00 pm.

14:21.190 --> 14:23.897
He had a post-it.
"GR 8" was written on it.

14:23.980 --> 14:26.357
"Gold Room, 8:00 pm."

14:26.440 --> 14:28.817
What was Jason
meeting Lisa Hexler about?

14:28.950 --> 14:30.065
I don't know,

14:30.160 --> 14:32.321
but whatever it was,
it got him killed.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.371
Hey. Did you
find any connection

14:40.460 --> 14:42.416
between Lisa Hexler
and Jason?

14:42.500 --> 14:43.831
I'm working on it,
boss. Close.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.121
All right. Because
we cannot go after
a big fish like her

14:46.210 --> 14:48.041
unless we have
something solid.
You got that?

14:49.300 --> 14:50.426
How about this?

14:50.510 --> 14:52.887
So I've been _
analy2ing information
on Jason's laptop,

14:52.970 --> 14:54.176
and even though
it's encrypted,

14:54.310 --> 14:55.925
I recovered a few
of the algorithms,

14:56.020 --> 14:58.636
and turns out they're
for gaming software.

14:58.730 --> 15:02.052
And if Jason was developing
gaming software,

15:02.150 --> 15:04.186
that could be something
Lisa Hexler would be
interested in.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.027
Right. And he if he was
developing it at work,

15:07.150 --> 15:08.276
then the people at Sistex

15:08.360 --> 15:10.021
might have
something to tell us.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.206
This is work?

15:21.330 --> 15:23.127
Makes Major Crimes
seem like the DMV.

15:23.210 --> 15:24.370
I should have been
a programmer.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.660
You can't program
your DVR.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.162
Hi, I'm William Houston,

15:28.260 --> 15:29.295
CEO of Sistex.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.291
Lieutenant Al Burns.
This is Detective
Carrie Wells.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.541
My son, Chris,
General Counsel.

15:35.350 --> 15:38.422
So, uh, you guys
knew Jason well?

15:38.520 --> 15:41.341
I try to get to know
all my junior programmers.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.896
He had a promising
career ahead of him.

15:43.690 --> 15:45.646
Well, Chris
can help you.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.061
If you need anything,
let me know.

15:47.190 --> 15:48.396
Sure.

15:49.070 --> 15:52.699
General Counsel, huh?
You didn't get the tech bug?

15:52.780 --> 15:55.988
Well, not every son
inherits his_father's
mad SCIentist gene.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.536
CHRIS: Oh, hey. Sorry.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.070
MAN 1: Excuse me!
MAN 2: Sorry about that!

15:59.200 --> 16:00.861
One of the hazards
of the business.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.030
Hey. Got that
modified Hopperbot.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.031
CHRIS: Thanks, Adam.
You can set it there.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.218
Were you close
with Jason?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.290
Yeah, he was a good guy.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.880
Can you think
of anyone in the company

16:14.970 --> 16:16.540
who may have wanted
to hurt him?

16:16.680 --> 16:17.999
Must be pretty
competitive.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.465
Well, it's a tough business,

16:19.560 --> 16:20.970
but, um, we try
to keep things

16:21.060 --> 16:22.220
pretty collegial
around here.

16:22.350 --> 16:23.726
Well, I imagine collegial

16:23.850 --> 16:25.226
and multi-million dollar
sobeare company

16:25.310 --> 16:26.550
don't always go
hand in hand.

16:26.690 --> 16:27.850
I take your point.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.316
Happy to get you
our HR files,

16:29.400 --> 16:30.731
but I don't think
you'll find anything.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.693
Do you know if
he had any relationship
with Lisa Hexler?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.656
Why? Because
of Satan's Palace?

16:36.740 --> 16:38.150
I doubt it.
I mean, um,

16:38.240 --> 16:40.071
that's the hottest
_ tech_attr_action
in the City right now.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.328
Well, was Jason developing
any gaming software?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.069
Not that I know of.
The company wasn't.

16:45.210 --> 16:46.370
We made _a decision
a long time ago

16:46.460 --> 16:47.745
to stay out
of the gaming market.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.456
Of course, it wouldn't
have stopped Lisa Hexler.

16:50.590 --> 16:53.423
From what_?
From poaching
our talent.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.080
Lisa's notorious
for finding the best

16:55.180 --> 16:57.887
young programmers
and designers in any field
and stealing them away

16:57.970 --> 16:59.426
to help build
her horror games.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.919
She's pretty
ruthless about it.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.931
DENNY: After you.
Hey, there she is.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.607
Excuse me, Ms. Hexler.
I'm Detective Lee.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.770
This is Detective Padilla.
NYPD, Major Crimes.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.525
Yes, I received
your calls.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.235
But you chose not
to respond to them?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.480
Did we not call them back?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.367
I'm sorry. Things are just
so busy with the rollout,
doing press for the game.

17:26.460 --> 17:27.916
Yeah, that's much
more important

17:28.000 --> 17:29.627
t_han a_mu_rder
investigation.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.080
I don't appreciate
the insinuation.

17:33.170 --> 17:35.081
And I would have been
at the crime scene myself,

17:35.180 --> 17:36.966
but I was on
a conference call
With Myanmar.

17:37.050 --> 17:38.460
Did you make those calls
from the Gold Room?

17:38.600 --> 17:39.840
Yeah, see,
we know about
the Gold Room

17:39.970 --> 17:41.551
hidden inside
Satan's Palace.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.050
And we know that_
you were meeting With
Jason Rios there

17:43.140 --> 17:45.131
last night just before
he was murdered.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.642
Which is odd
because you were
nowhere to be found

17:47.770 --> 17:49.055
after he turned up dead.

17:49.690 --> 17:52.568
I am responsible
to thousands
of shareholders.

17:52.650 --> 17:55.608
How do you
think it would look
for a Fortune 500 CEO

17:55.700 --> 17:57.270
to be in the vicinity
of a murder scene?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.520
Like you were innocent,

17:58.660 --> 18:00.525
and helping with
a murder investigation.

18:00.660 --> 18:03.072
I'm sorry
ifI sound callous,

18:03.160 --> 18:05.822
but I assure you
I had nothing to do with
that young man's death.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.241
Why were you
meeting with Jason?

18:07.330 --> 18:09.821
I meet with programmers
all the time.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.872
You mean you steal them
from other companies
all the time.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.501
I mean I win.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.545
I'd heard good
things about Jason

18:16.670 --> 18:18.001
and he was everything
people said.

18:18.130 --> 18:20.462
We talked, I explained
what I could offer,

18:20.550 --> 18:23.007
and then
I told him to go enjoy
Satan's Palace IV.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.306
That was the last
Imdem

18:24.390 --> 18:26.346
And we're done.
If there's anything
further,

18:26.480 --> 18:28.937
Jeff can
put you in touch
with my lavwers.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.766
Hmm.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.432
Well, I heard you two
annoyed Lisa Hexler earlier.

18:35.530 --> 18:36.849
Well, we learned
from the best, baby.
Thank you.

18:36.950 --> 18:40.317
And it looks like Lisa
has reasons other than us
to be annoyed.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.946
Hexler Gaming
is in big trouble.

18:42.030 --> 18:44.362
Now according to
industry analysts,

18:44.490 --> 18:47.709
their last three games
have underperformed
retail projections.

18:47.830 --> 18:51.618
And recent SEC filings
show them operating
at some serious debt.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.587
I mean, the board
was losing confidence
in Lisa Hexler.

18:53.710 --> 18:55.871
Well, that would
be enough to get her to
do something desperate.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.507
And apparently
the company's got

18:57.590 --> 18:59.546
everything riding on
their 3-D gameplay.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.211
Problem is, the release
date was delayed

19:02.300 --> 19:03.881
at least four times
in the past year.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.171
Word is, Hexler Gaming
hasn't developed

19:06.270 --> 19:10.934
the battery technology
to power their stand-alone
3-D gaming headsets.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.975
GENEVIEVE: No.
Things seemed to be
going really well.

19:15.070 --> 19:16.776
I could tell by how much
sleep he got.

19:16.900 --> 19:19.357
Last few days,
he was up almost
all night tinkering

19:19.450 --> 19:21.600
with all his little toys
going at once.

19:21.740 --> 19:22.729
Wait a second.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.697
I saw a headset
just like that
at Jason's place.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.862
And his fiancee
said he'd been working
all night recently,

19:28.960 --> 19:31.451
with all his stuff
powered up.

19:31.580 --> 19:32.820
Now what if Jason_
came up With something

19:32.920 --> 19:34.581
that could power
that headset?

19:34.670 --> 19:36.046
A long-lasting battery.

19:36.130 --> 19:37.666
That'd be enough
to save Lisa Hexler's butt.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.001
I mean, it'd be worth
hundreds of millions.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.751
No, thousands.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.046
Thousands of millions.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.129
Those are billions, Denny.

19:44.260 --> 19:45.340
Eh, agree to disagree.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.210
You guys, What if Lisa
wasn't just having

19:48.310 --> 19:49.550
a meet and greet
with Jason?

19:49.640 --> 19:50.800
What if she was
trying to get her hands

19:50.940 --> 19:52.305
on Whatever he'd built?

19:52.440 --> 19:55.432
And what if she was willing
to do anything it took
to get it from him?

19:56.480 --> 19:59.643
Jay, work your magic
and tell me Where
she is right now.

19:59.780 --> 20:01.520
Okay. Hold on one...

20:04.780 --> 20:07.283
Her cell phone just
pinged off of a tower
on the Lower East Side.

20:07.370 --> 20:09.281
Wait, what's on
the Lower East Side?

20:09.410 --> 20:11.116
Something, something.

20:11.830 --> 20:13.661
Hexler Gaming just
closed on a warehouse

20:13.790 --> 20:15.337
_ to build their next
Simulated game enVIronment.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.121
It's 457 Madison Street.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.749
All right.

20:28.140 --> 20:29.846
See if there's
another way in.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.191
Ah...

20:42.990 --> 20:44.150
Al.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.207
According to the M.E.,
blunt force trauma.

20:56.330 --> 20:58.662
Someone smashed her
head against the wall
multiple times.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.415
400 bucks in her
Birkin handbag,

21:00.510 --> 21:01.909
so it wasn't
a robbery.

21:05.050 --> 21:06.176
What's up?
JAY LEE: Hey, Al.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.500
I checked Lisa's
phone records,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.340
and it turns out she was
called by a burner cell

21:09.470 --> 21:10.880
two hours before
her death.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.261
Could be how the killer
lured Lisa down here.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.341
See if you can find out
who purchased that burner.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.839
JAY LEE: You got it, boss.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.237
CHRIS: Well, not every son
inherits his father's
mad scientist gene.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.116
Anything?

21:29.660 --> 21:30.695
The gum wrapper.

21:31.870 --> 21:33.076
It's from the
concentration gum

21:33.200 --> 21:35.532
that they were developing
at Jason's company.

21:38.790 --> 21:40.496
I'm sorry, but this
is a lot to take in.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.502
You really think
that someone at Sistex

21:43.590 --> 21:45.751
killed Jason
and Lisa Hexler?

21:45.880 --> 21:47.928
Someone left a wrapper

21:48.050 --> 21:50.006
of your concentration gum
at the crime scene.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.886
That stuff is not
on the market yet.

21:51.970 --> 21:54.723
Any idea who would
have access to it?

21:54.810 --> 21:57.438
I could throw a dart.
The whole company
is obsessed with the stuff.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.393
And what about 3
Are they obsessed with that?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.061
If you mean, do we have
any 3-D technology

22:02.190 --> 22:03.771
currently under
development? No.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.778
Is it possible Jason was
off developing on his own?

22:06.900 --> 22:08.401
We encourage
independent work.

22:08.530 --> 22:11.192
That said, our employees
all sign pretty standard
exclusivity deals.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.657
They know anything
they come up with
belongs to Sistex.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.248
You know who
you should speak with
is Rhonda Matthews.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.496
She and Jason
were friends.

22:18.580 --> 22:20.036
If anybody knows
What he was up to
in his spare time,

22:20.130 --> 22:21.370
she would.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.371
I'm just curious,
how would the
company react

22:23.460 --> 22:25.291
if an individual
tried to market

22:25.420 --> 22:27.081
something he'd come up
with on his own?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.928
Well, we'd ask
that employee not to.

22:30.010 --> 22:32.592
And if they continued,
we'd sue them.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.590
We wouldn't
kill them, Detective,

22:35.730 --> 22:37.516
if that's
What you're imagining.

22:38.940 --> 22:41.226
Rhonda, these people
are from the police.

22:41.310 --> 22:42.607
They have some
questions about Jason.

22:42.690 --> 22:45.181
Uh, sure.
Of course.

22:47.740 --> 22:49.776
This is all
so unbelievable.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.150
Did you find out
who did it?

22:51.280 --> 22:53.271
You and Jason
were pretty close,
weren't you?

22:53.410 --> 22:56.322
Yes, but I have
no idea who killed him.

22:56.450 --> 22:58.953
You and Jason
worked on a number
of pr0jects together?

22:59.040 --> 23:01.531
Yeah. Sistex
encourages teamwork.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.123
Although Jason
and I haven't worked
on a pr0ject together in...

23:06.260 --> 23:07.409
I don't know,
almost a year.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.171
I miss working with him.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.546
And now...

23:12.640 --> 23:13.629
I know it's difficult,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.638
but do you know if Jason
was working on something

23:16.720 --> 23:18.631
outside_ the office
on his own?

23:19.520 --> 23:21.806
I don't think so.
I don't... I don't know.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.318
Um...excuse me.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.520
It would have been
two years next month.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.868
AL: Anything you can tell us?
Anything going on with Jason?

23:35.830 --> 23:37.115
We're gonna
give you a moment.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.656
Thanks.

23:44.460 --> 23:46.542
She has a molecule model
in her drawer.

23:46.670 --> 23:48.797
I saw the exact some one
at Jason's house.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.713
They both do computer science.
They work together.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.922
No, they haven't worked
together for over a year.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.887
She knows more
than she's telling us.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.261
It's Jay.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.726
Yeah?
JAY LEE: Hey, Al.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.590
I managed
to track the purchase
of that burner cell

24:01.690 --> 24:02.679
that called Lisa Hexler.

24:02.810 --> 24:04.186
It came from a bodega

24:04.310 --> 24:06.141
three blocks
from Sistex Software.

24:06.230 --> 24:08.027
You got a description
of the guy who bought it?

24:08.150 --> 24:10.698
Nope. Store records
show that it was
paid for in cash.

24:10.820 --> 24:11.775
That's all I got, boss.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.737
The burner cell
that called Lisa Hexler

24:13.870 --> 24:15.485
was bought near here.

24:17.030 --> 24:19.282
Really? Well,
you know What?

24:19.370 --> 24:21.747
Tell Jay to call
that burner cell.

24:22.710 --> 24:24.200
Go ahead and dial
the number.

24:24.290 --> 24:25.325
You got it.

24:35.930 --> 24:37.420
Aren't you going
to answer that?

24:37.560 --> 24:40.302
Uh, it's not mine.

24:40.390 --> 24:42.221
I think it's coming
from your drawer.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.401
Oh, you just hung up
on a friend of ours.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.026
This isn't my phone.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.320
I swear, I've never
seen this before.

25:00.410 --> 25:01.399
You want some advice?

25:01.540 --> 25:03.451
You might want to use it
to call a lawyer.

25:17.050 --> 25:20.133
LAWYER: As I said,
my client never saw that
phone before in her life

25:20.260 --> 25:21.466
until it rang
inside the drawer.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.885
Yeah, I'm always
finding phones

25:22.980 --> 25:24.845
I've never seen before
in5ide my drawers.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.727
She also has an alibi
for the night Jason Rios
was killed.

25:27.810 --> 25:29.858
You told me.
At the movies.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.395
By herself.

25:34.150 --> 25:35.356
There are better
alibis, you know.

25:35.450 --> 25:39.022
She bought a box
of Dots and a Diet Coke
with her credit card.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.326
Maybe you could try
checking it out.

25:40.450 --> 25:42.862
Oh, we will.
We'll check it out.

25:42.950 --> 25:44.156
Believe me.

25:46.790 --> 25:48.451
Okay, what
have you got?

25:48.540 --> 25:50.496
Okay, so check it, boss.

25:50.630 --> 25:52.700
I got a search warrant
for Rhonda's personal
computer.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.506
Mmm-hmm. _
I remotely accessed it,

25:54.630 --> 25:56.006
and it's got mostly
personal stuff on it

25:56.130 --> 25:59.714
except for one
large protected file,
heavily encrypted.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.960
Yeah, but you
cracked it, right?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.095
Of course I did.
Of course you did.

26:02.180 --> 26:03.340
I'm gonna spare you
the gory details,

26:03.470 --> 26:04.971
but take a look at that.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.799
That's the
same molecule

26:08.900 --> 26:10.606
Carrie found
in Rhonda's desk.

26:10.690 --> 26:12.817
Does Al know this?
Yup.

26:12.940 --> 26:14.146
Just watch.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.810
AL: You still
haven't explained

26:15.900 --> 26:17.401
how you ended up
with that phone.

26:17.490 --> 26:19.367
I told you, someone's
setting me up.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.026
The same someone
who made you lie to us

26:21.160 --> 26:23.287
about helping Jason
with that battery?

26:23.370 --> 26:24.906
What are you
talking about?
Oh...

26:26.830 --> 26:28.821
Jason had a model

26:28.960 --> 26:31.531
just like that
in his apartment.

26:31.670 --> 26:33.911
It's the critical component
of next phase batteries.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.830
Jason was developing them

26:35.920 --> 26:37.717
_for someone
out5ide the company,

26:37.840 --> 26:39.671
and you were
helping him. Now talk.

26:40.760 --> 26:45.345
Yes, all right.
I knew about his work.

26:45.470 --> 26:46.880
We even worked
together for a While,

26:47.020 --> 26:49.181
butJason_
was so secretive,

26:49.310 --> 26:51.187
I felt like that
he was shutting me out.

26:51.270 --> 26:53.397
So I finally
told him, "Screw it,"

26:53.520 --> 26:54.851
he could keep
working by himself.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.858
Then you heard
he had a breakthrough,
right?

26:58.700 --> 27:01.942
Based on work
you and he did
together, right?

27:02.870 --> 27:06.328
Not only that,
he was gonna sell it
for a lot of money.

27:06.410 --> 27:07.866
You must have been so angry

27:07.960 --> 27:11.282
that he was gonna meet
with Lisa Hexler without you.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.372
I'm about one second
from shutting this down.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.757
Do we have anything
on this movie alibi?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.882
Okay, just hold on.
Uh, come on, come on.

27:21.970 --> 27:24.177
Rhonda's last
credit card statement,

27:24.260 --> 27:25.921
Dots and Diet Coke, 18.50.

27:26.060 --> 27:28.551
For candy and soda?
That's who we should
be arresting.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.130
But alibi checks out
though, boss.

27:30.230 --> 27:32.391
No way
she gets across town
in time to kill Jason.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.896
All right, well,
I'll let Al know.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.900
Look,

27:47.450 --> 27:49.452
I don't want to charge
your client with murder,

27:50.460 --> 27:55.989
but so far,
no one remembers her
from that movie theater.

27:56.090 --> 27:58.456
So things look
a little sketchy
right here.

28:00.090 --> 28:03.253
If there's something
that you want to tell me,

28:04.510 --> 28:06.387
now would be
the time to do that.

28:12.850 --> 28:15.933
Something did happen,
uh, three days ago.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.100
Go on.

28:19.110 --> 28:22.273
I was getting ready
to head out for lunch,

28:22.360 --> 28:25.614
and I saw Jason
putting on a jacket
and tie.

28:25.740 --> 28:27.947
I didn't even
know Jason owned
stuff like that.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.453
He said he was
worried about sweating
on the subway,

28:31.580 --> 28:33.070
so he was Ubering
to Midtown,

28:33.170 --> 28:35.570
and I made some joke
about mystery date,

28:35.670 --> 28:38.082
but he didn't
say anything.

28:38.170 --> 28:39.330
And later,
when he came back,

28:39.460 --> 28:40.666
I thought he'd
be in a good mood,

28:40.800 --> 28:43.041
but he was just
really quiet.

28:44.340 --> 28:47.559
I didn't know
What happened, but I knew
something was really wrong.

28:50.430 --> 28:52.341
You know what?
We need to know
about Jason's lunch.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.345
Hey, can you check...
Check his Uber records.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.438
Already on it,
uh, searching for
e-mail receipts

28:57.520 --> 28:59.818
around lunchtime
last Wednesday.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.988
Got it.
Precisely 12:03,

29:02.110 --> 29:04.658
Jason was dropped off
at 712 West 47th.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.578
712, that's La Maison.
Excellent croque—monsieur.

29:07.660 --> 29:10.151
All right, you know what?
Cross reference all the
credit card charges

29:10.290 --> 29:12.906
with persons of interest
in this investigation.
See what you get.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.161
I could, boss, or...

29:15.290 --> 29:16.826
Come on.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.127
I could crack the restaurant's
internal security cameras

29:19.210 --> 29:20.837
and we could see
What Jason was
havmg for lunch.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.336
Well, there's that.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.138
Camera C.
That's Jason.

29:30.600 --> 29:31.919
JAY LEE: Well,
he's upset about something.

29:32.850 --> 29:34.681
Geez, when is this guy
gonna turn around?
I know it.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.647
JAY LEE: Got ya.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.720
That's William Houston.
He's the founder of Sistex.

29:41.860 --> 29:43.179
Now what's he doing
having lunch

29:43.280 --> 29:45.316
with one of his
low

29:45.400 --> 29:48.619
And more importantly,
Why didn't he let us
know about it?

29:54.870 --> 29:56.781
Look,
I... I told you

29:56.870 --> 29:58.701
I meet with all my
promising employees

29:58.830 --> 30:00.377
on a regular basis.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.740
But what you
didn't tell us

30:01.880 --> 30:03.086
was that you had
lunch with Jason

30:03.210 --> 30:04.871
the day before
he was murdered.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.375
Um...

30:08.180 --> 30:09.590
Honestly, there's
so many of these kids.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.507
I... I'm not as good
with names and faces

30:12.600 --> 30:14.841
like I used to be.

30:14.930 --> 30:16.431
Must be nice
to not remember

30:16.560 --> 30:18.687
treating someone
to a $400 lunch.

30:18.770 --> 30:21.819
A $400 lunch where
you got into a...

30:21.900 --> 30:23.390
...very heated
argument with him.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.395
It was hardly
an argument.

30:25.530 --> 30:26.736
You know how
these kids are.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.560
He had a _list
of suggestions

30:28.660 --> 30:30.560
for the future
of my company.

30:30.660 --> 30:33.322
I listened to them,
but at some point,
you know,

30:33.410 --> 30:36.573
I... I had to say,
"Thank you very much,"

30:36.710 --> 30:39.247
and he got aggravated
and stormed out.

30:39.580 --> 30:40.877
So odd.

30:42.380 --> 30:44.507
Because that description
doesn't match

30:44.590 --> 30:47.252
What we've been told
about Jason Rios at all.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.717
We heard he was
pretty easy-gomg.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.257
That's not
the young man
I saw at lunch.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.477
GENEVIEVE: I'm in
the fashion business.
I go to Europe a lot.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.227
That's where I met Jason.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.932
You were in the
1992 Olympic Games
in Barcelona, huh?

31:04.820 --> 31:07.778
Last time
the US. sailing team
won six silver medals.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.690
Yes, indeed.
Very good.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.736
Who's that beautiful woman
in the photo?

31:14.660 --> 31:15.991
Part of the crew?

31:16.500 --> 31:20.118
Oh, I suppose so.
It was 20 years ago.

31:20.250 --> 31:22.070
23 years, actually.

31:23.090 --> 31:25.206
Exactly the same
age as Jason.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.085
Interesting.

31:27.170 --> 31:28.580
You know_
What's interesting?

31:30.090 --> 31:32.331
Jason had a picture
of himself

31:32.470 --> 31:34.256
as a little boy,
and that woman

31:35.310 --> 31:36.766
was holding him.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.186
She's his mother,
isn't she?

31:43.110 --> 31:44.680
And you're his father.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.471
I've got nothing to say.

31:47.610 --> 31:49.180
It's gonna be
a lot easier for you

31:49.320 --> 31:51.606
if you just
talk to us right now.

31:57.830 --> 32:00.458
Graciela was
the most beautiful woman
I'd ever laid eyes on.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.006
It was one night.

32:08.130 --> 32:10.007
I didn't even know
about Jason until...

32:11.220 --> 32:13.040
A year later,
she sent me a picture.

32:13.930 --> 32:16.751
I tried to do my best
to look out for him.

32:16.850 --> 32:18.806
I paid for his education.

32:18.890 --> 32:21.131
And she wrote me
and said he'd won a...

32:25.230 --> 32:29.599
Robotics Scholarship
competition.

32:29.690 --> 32:33.103
And you knew
he had it, your gift.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.610
Yeah.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.649
He was just like me.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.826
So when he was
old enough,

32:44.920 --> 32:46.285
I arranged for him
to come to Sistex.

32:46.380 --> 32:47.449
I wanted to tell him.

32:49.210 --> 32:51.622
I wanted to tell Chris,
but I just didn't know how.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.086
But somehow at that lunch,

32:54.220 --> 32:57.132
after he told you
about his breakthrough,

32:57.220 --> 32:59.927
you finally figured out
how to tell him.

33:00.060 --> 33:03.188
How to make sure
you could get your hands
on that new battery.

33:03.270 --> 33:05.591
No, no. It wasn't
that way at all.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.732
I told him because
I was proud of him.

33:11.860 --> 33:14.738
Can you imagine a boy, 23,
with a breakthrough like that?

33:16.200 --> 33:18.236
And he was furious with me.
Told me he hated me.

33:18.370 --> 33:19.906
Told me he was gonna hate me
for the rest of his life

33:20.040 --> 33:21.109
for abandoning his mother.

33:22.660 --> 33:25.208
Told me he was taking
the battery to Lisa Hexler.

33:25.290 --> 33:27.667
And you followed him
to the meeting with her.

33:28.290 --> 33:30.246
Yeah. Yes.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.376
Then when he
came out of the room,

33:34.470 --> 33:36.631
I don't know
What came over me.
I grabbed a wrench.

33:37.510 --> 33:38.590
I hit him.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.966
I hit him again.
He stopped moving.

33:44.270 --> 33:46.807
And, uh, what about
Lisa Hexler, hmm?

33:46.940 --> 33:48.510
I tried to, uh,
talk to her,

33:48.610 --> 33:51.010
and she said
there was, uh, no deal.

33:52.320 --> 33:53.480
She knew I...

33:55.150 --> 33:57.106
Had stolen the
battery from Jason.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.400
She was trying
to blackmail me,

33:58.490 --> 34:00.117
so when she
turned around, I...

34:06.460 --> 34:07.700
I'm sorry.

34:09.420 --> 34:12.162
Mr. Houston, you're gonna
have to come with us.

34:25.180 --> 34:26.681
What are you doing?
My father didn't do anything.

34:26.810 --> 34:28.641
Hey, look at me.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.891
Your father's under arrest
for the murder of Jason Rios.

34:30.980 --> 34:32.891
That's insane.
Did your father
tell you

34:32.980 --> 34:34.982
that Jason was
your half

34:36.490 --> 34:38.981
He did, he told me
just today, this morning.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.408
He said
he told Jason over lunch
a couple of days ago,

34:41.490 --> 34:43.481
and now I had to know.

34:43.620 --> 34:44.780
_ Now what
is g0ing on?

34:44.870 --> 34:47.156
Got that modified
Hopperbot.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.417
Thanks, Adam.
You can set it there.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.540
Now what if Jason_
came up With something

34:56.670 --> 34:58.126
that could power
that headset?

34:58.220 --> 35:00.085
JAY _LEE:
A long-lasting battery.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.802
Well, not every son
inherits his_father's
mad SCIentist gene.

35:03.890 --> 35:07.974
You know, um,
I think your father's
gonna need you.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.551
Chris, why don't you
let me take you to him?

35:11.440 --> 35:12.509
Okay.

35:19.990 --> 35:22.117
Hey, Al,
can I talk to you
for a second?

35:22.200 --> 35:23.485
Chris, wait with
that officer.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.787
I'll take you to your dad
in a minute, all right?

35:25.870 --> 35:27.155
What's up?

35:27.250 --> 35:31.368
I think we might have been
hasty in our decision
to arrest Mr. Houston.

35:32.670 --> 35:34.626
until we get
the fingerprints off
the murder weapon.

35:34.710 --> 35:36.621
We're not gonna arrest him?
Well, no,
I mean, yes.

35:36.710 --> 35:38.007
He confessed. Of course
we're gonna arrest him.

35:38.090 --> 35:39.216
But you know
any good lawyer

35:39.340 --> 35:41.171
could get that
confession thrown out,

35:41.260 --> 35:43.137
but now that we know _
Where the murder weapon is,

35:43.220 --> 35:44.505
all we have to do
is go get it,

35:44.600 --> 35:47.763
get the prints off it,
we got an airtight case.

35:47.890 --> 35:50.518
Right. And then
the good news
for us is?

35:50.600 --> 35:53.182
The good news
for us is that, you know,

35:53.270 --> 35:54.851
given all the things
they can do now...

35:54.940 --> 35:56.271
The technology.
At the lab,

35:56.400 --> 35:58.777
even if he washed
that murder weapon
down with bleach,

35:58.900 --> 36:00.606
we could get
his prints off it.

36:00.740 --> 36:03.231
Exactly.
You have the
murder weapon?

36:03.320 --> 36:04.651
You know, Chris,

36:05.740 --> 36:07.196
your father's
free to go.

36:07.870 --> 36:09.747
He is?
For now.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.416
Take him
to his father, okay?

36:17.590 --> 36:19.717
Please tell me
Why we just released
a killer.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.587
We didn't, but we're
about to catch one.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.091
So, the guy
confesses, right?

36:31.230 --> 36:32.970
You_ have _
opportunity, motive,

36:33.100 --> 36:34.601
and every detail
is consistent

36:34.690 --> 36:36.100
to what we know
about this murder,

36:36.190 --> 36:38.476
but you are not
convinced. Why?

36:38.610 --> 36:40.521
Because William
Houston didn't do it.

36:40.610 --> 36:42.771
Carries thinks his son,
Chris, killed Jason.

36:42.860 --> 36:45.488
Really? What do
you think, Lieutenant?

36:45.620 --> 36:46.939
I think she's right.

36:49.580 --> 36:52.322
Because of a toy
lizard in a box?

36:52.460 --> 36:54.576
A toy lizard in a box
powered by a battery

36:54.670 --> 36:56.456
invented by Jason Rios.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.504
Chris took that battery
from Jason the night
he killed him.

37:00.630 --> 37:03.292
Oh, so he's got the battery.
Why kill Lisa Hexler?

37:03.430 --> 37:05.887
We think Chris
met with Hexler
to make a deal.

37:05.970 --> 37:07.756
Something went wrong
and he took her out.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.465
The he planted
the burner cell

37:09.600 --> 37:11.977
in Rhonda's drawer
to frame her.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.590
At some point, he told
his father about it

37:13.690 --> 37:16.056
'cause right now, his father
is covering for him.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.141
So Chris discovers
that he's got a brother.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.773
Not only that,
but he's got
a genius brother,

37:20.860 --> 37:22.646
who he thinks
is gonna sell

37:22.780 --> 37:25.021
his genius battery
to a competitor.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.981
Yeah.
So Chris takes out
his brother,

37:28.080 --> 37:29.650
saves his
daddy's company.

37:30.620 --> 37:31.655
Where's the
murder weapon?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.570
Chris will lead us
right to it.

37:33.660 --> 37:34.991
Carrie's outside
his office right now

37:35.080 --> 37:36.490
waiting for him
to make his move.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.121
Hey, guys, it's show time.
Carrie called.

37:39.210 --> 37:41.371
Chris Houston
just got in a cab
headed uptown.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.709
CARRIE: BOO!

37:53.680 --> 37:55.636
Get your hands up.
Put the weapon down.

37:55.730 --> 37:56.845
Now!

37:58.610 --> 38:01.352
My father confessed.
This will never stick.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.141
I'll just say he told me
Where he left it.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.731
Your father doesn't know
Where the weapon was.

38:05.860 --> 38:07.487
I asked him.

38:07.570 --> 38:10.323
You're the only one
who knew exactly
Where to find it.

38:11.580 --> 38:14.492
Hey, I get it.
His only son.

38:14.580 --> 38:16.536
Brilliant,
successful father,

38:16.620 --> 38:18.247
and all you want
is to impress him.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.529
And then suddenly,
out of the blue,

38:20.630 --> 38:21.949
he has another son.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.257
You don't know
What you're talking about.

38:24.380 --> 38:28.009
Only that son,
he has everything
you don't.

38:29.260 --> 38:30.716
He was born
with that genius,

38:30.850 --> 38:32.715
that spark that you
always wanted.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.459
And then
to top it all off,

38:35.850 --> 38:38.057
he goes and creates
something magical.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.391
That little shit _
was gonna give it
to Lisa Hexler.

38:40.520 --> 38:43.899
I couldn't let him do that.
It's worth $1/2 billion.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.601
You followed your
brother to the meeting.

38:46.740 --> 38:48.731
You asked him for the battery,
he refused, you killed him.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.066
I get that.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.229
But why kill Lisa?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.196
I tried selling it to her,
but she figured out
What I'd done.

38:55.290 --> 38:57.406
She said I had two choices.
Either give her the battery...

38:57.500 --> 38:59.240
Or she'd
call the police.

39:00.750 --> 39:03.332
You were gonna let
your father go down
for this murder.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.757
No wonder
he preferred Jason.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.046
Shut up!

39:20.270 --> 39:22.727
(DEMONIC LAUGHTER
OVER LOUDSPEAKERS)

39:34.120 --> 39:35.530
Let the games begin.

39:59.020 --> 40:00.590
Yes.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.431
Always loved me

40:20.410 --> 40:21.490

40:34.180 --> 40:35.670
Damn it.

Freeze!

40:59.290 --> 41:00.655
Got ya.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.371

41:20.390 --> 41:21.379
Hey.

41:22.060 --> 41:23.129
What you up to?

41:23.230 --> 41:25.050
Just catching up
on some evidence logs.

41:25.190 --> 41:26.851
Diligent.
Yeah.

41:26.940 --> 41:29.010
So I have a question.

41:29.110 --> 41:31.852
How'd you find me so fast
inside Satan's Palace?

41:31.940 --> 41:34.067
I don't know.
Wasn't so hard.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.565
Really? 'Cause it's
a pretty tough game.

41:36.240 --> 41:38.526
I managed.
I bet.

41:40.700 --> 41:43.749
Oh! What?

41:43.830 --> 41:44.910
Level two. You're
d0Ing pretty well.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.701
Oh, and you think
you're the only one

41:46.790 --> 41:47.916
who played
video games?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.740
You remember that old
Pac-Man machine

41:50.840 --> 41:52.330
in Cal's
back in Syracuse?

41:52.420 --> 41:55.469
Just so you know,
I had the highest score
on that machine

41:55.590 --> 41:57.751
for 29 straight weeks
back in 1982.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.289
No one in high school
could touch me.

41:59.430 --> 42:01.170
Of course I remember
that Pac-Man machine.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.927
And are you sure you had
the highest score?

42:04.020 --> 42:05.305
Second highest.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.589
There was someone
who scored, like,

42:06.690 --> 42:08.226
10,000 more points
than anyone else,

42:08.310 --> 42:09.390
but we knew
he was cheating.

42:11.900 --> 42:13.106
Yeah. Those
were the initials.

Oh, no way.
No way!

Yes! Yes!
What were you,
like, seven?

42:19.240 --> 42:20.730
Actually, I was six.
I used to go there

42:20.830 --> 42:23.116
to drink hot chocolate
and play Pac-Man.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.610
You got beat
by a little girl.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.365
Want me to help
you with this?

42:27.460 --> 42:28.620
No, no, no.
I don't need help.

42:28.750 --> 42:29.785
You do need help.
Mmm, nope.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.029
Come on.

42:32.630 --> 42:33.870
All right, quick.
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90!

42:33.960 --> 42:36.337
Go, before
the force field goes.
There's... Good.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.619
Good, good, good.
Take him out, Al!

42:37.720 --> 42:39.176
Take him out!
Come on.
I got It.
