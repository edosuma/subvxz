NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.504 --> 00:07.384
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.441 --> 00:09.281
the police
who investigate crime

00:09.343 --> 00:12.153
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.692
These are their stories.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.919
9:00 a.m. sharp, Antonio.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.457
ANTONIO:
I couldn't find Henry.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.829
Maybe that's because he goes off
duty when you come on duty.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.839
He goes off duty after I've
signed for the rounds sheet.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.462
Did you look for him
in the men's room?

00:26.527 --> 00:27.897
Yeah.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.671
Do you know where he
goes after work? No.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.540
If you can't find him,
I'll call Mr. Simmons

00:31.598 --> 00:33.598
and we'll hire
another watchman.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.714
Oh. My God!

00:36.803 --> 00:38.583
Oh. My God!

00:38.639 --> 00:41.249
Henry! Mr. Wick, over here!

00:41.308 --> 00:42.578
What?

00:43.877 --> 00:44.907
BRISCOE: How bad is he?

00:44.978 --> 00:48.078
We got him stabilized, but his blood
pressure's barely 80 over 50.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.288
Pulse is off the charts.

00:49.349 --> 00:50.829
He got that way
from a knock on the head?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.304
Hell of a knock.
LOGAN: Heart attack?

00:52.352 --> 00:54.732
I'll send you a diagnosis
with my bill.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.388
This is Mr. Wick, the manager
of the safe deposit company.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.437
People rent these boxes
just like at a bank?

00:59.493 --> 01:02.003
Everybody needs a secure
place for their valuables.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.062
Looks like they'd do better
shoving them under the mattress.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.771
Well, this door
is two feet thick.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.612
The lock's on a timer.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.901
BRISCOE: You got
some pretty big mice.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.420
Hey, you don't
reinforce the floor?

01:12.472 --> 01:14.782
We don't own the floor.
We rent this space.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.191
But it is six inches
of reinforced concrete.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.554
Who has access to the basement?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.062
Uh, janitors?

01:20.113 --> 01:21.723
No. The basement door
was crowbarred.

01:21.782 --> 01:22.922
It's not on an alarm?

01:22.983 --> 01:25.693
It's a basement.
There's nothing down there.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.102
Just a stairway to heaven.

He's in
ventricular tachycardia.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.110
He's responding to medication.

02:22.175 --> 02:24.745
Well, this tachycardia,
could it have been brought on

02:24.811 --> 02:26.981
by being jumped
and handcuffed to a wall?

02:27.047 --> 02:30.547
I suppose, but if that hadn't done
it, something else would have.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.415
Mr. Maybrook has
alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.028
Is that as bad as it sounds?

02:36.089 --> 02:38.929
Worse. Your victim has killed
an awful lot of whiskey.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.166
He'll probably be dead
in a year.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.710
HENRY: A man called
about midnight,

02:46.466 --> 02:48.966
said he was
from the alarm company,

02:49.970 --> 02:52.140
asked if everything
was all right,

02:52.339 --> 02:54.049
said they were
getting an alarm.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.207
But everything was quiet
where you were?

02:56.276 --> 02:58.476
Dead quiet, I told him.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.493
He called back
five minutes later.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.516
Said they were
getting another alarm.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.063
They'd have to
come over and fix it.

03:08.121 --> 03:11.571
Well, Henry, this didn't make
you a little suspicious?

03:13.694 --> 03:17.974
A man came over.
He was wearing a uniform.

03:18.732 --> 03:22.152
He marched me down to the
basement and put a mask over me.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.942
You ever see anybody
nosing around the basement?

03:25.272 --> 03:27.912
I don't know
who they have down there.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.184
Basement is not my territory.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.087
When did these burglars
put you in the vault?

03:33.146 --> 03:36.056
When they were done.
It seemed like forever.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.557
I was feeling bad.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.229
BRISCOE:
Did you hear them talking?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.630
No, couldn't hear much.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.727
They had some kind of tools.
Noisy.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.035
The tool of choice of today's
sophisticated burglars.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.102
Meet the Porto-Jack,
gentlemen.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.281
This thing busted through
the basement ceiling?

04:00.340 --> 04:01.840
They used a slightly
larger model

04:01.908 --> 04:05.118
to jack up the I.A. freeways
after the earthquake.

04:05.278 --> 04:08.618
This one can twist
a truck frame into shape.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.329
Sit it on the floor,

04:10.383 --> 04:13.493
you attach a steel rod here, it'll
push through a foot of concrete.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.503
Well, what about the rebars
in the ceiling?

04:15.722 --> 04:19.902
Tensile strength but no trick to cut
through with a reciprocating saw.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.870
Yeah. Well,
when you pump this thing,

04:21.928 --> 04:24.878
how does it know to punch through
the ceiling, not through the floor?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.431
You put a metal plate under it

04:26.500 --> 04:28.780
to dissipate the force
in that direction.

04:28.835 --> 04:29.965
Was there a plate
in your basement?

04:30.036 --> 04:31.666
Yeah, but no jack.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.278
We didn't know
it was a matched set.

(POLICE RADIO CHATTERING)

04:40.881 --> 04:43.921
LOGAN: Well, they knew
where to punch that hole.

04:43.984 --> 04:46.794
Or the guy who jumped Henry
could've paced it off.

04:46.853 --> 04:50.133
He would have showed up on that
video camera above the vault door.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.730
He never got near it.
So they had the plans.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.673
Or they've been here before.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.938
Or it's an inside job.

04:57.531 --> 05:01.241
Well, we start tracing
all the maintenance personnel.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.614
Yeah, well, it doesn't look
like they got down here much.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.048
Look at this mess.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.313
What have you got?

You gotta be pretty hard-core
to drink this crap.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.788
Is that where you
take your siestas, Henry?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.796
Your fingerprints
are on that bottle.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.798
You told us you never
went in the basement.

You lied to us, Henry.

05:28.528 --> 05:33.238
Oh, what... what if I did sneak
down now and again, take a nip?

05:33.934 --> 05:36.854
I couldn't tell you that.
I was on the job.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.117
You know how it is.

you needed some refreshment.

I can understand that.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.685
Right, right. No big deal.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.504
Yeah, so you slip
down to the basement,

05:56.556 --> 05:59.126
where nobody can see you,
and you unwind.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.692
Yeah. You've been there.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.140
Yeah. Then you,
you get to looking around,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.726
and you see that ceiling
and you start thinking.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.299
No, no, no.
Yeah. You start thinking how

06:07.367 --> 06:09.237
there's only a few inches
between you

06:09.302 --> 06:10.512
and all that good stuff
in that vault.

We can match

claim their stuff?

enough to hold that bag?

got out of the army.

better than I do.

with hot money and a gun

10:05.438 --> 10:06.938
sees his name in the obituaries

and decides to borrow his name.

is interview anybody

who read a newspaper in 1969.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.386
The gun's not traceable.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.757
Maybe the money is.

C. Douglas Dillon."

for J. Edgar Hoover?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.003
Let's go to the library.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.598
"Federal agents arrested
four Catholic priests"

11:35.662 --> 11:38.942
"for pouring their own blood
over draft files."

11:38.998 --> 11:41.068
Yeah. They nabbed
Dr. Spock, too.

11:41.401 --> 11:45.141
Every once in a while they
actually tangled with a criminal.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.645
Wow! Look at this.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.450
Three days before the safe
deposit box was rented,

11:53.880 --> 11:57.730
$200,000 was stolen
from a payroll.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.001
Nucon Technologies,
defense contractor.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.555
I remember that.
They killed a cop.

12:04.824 --> 12:05.964
Yeah.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.942
"Vincent J. Perella."

12:07.994 --> 12:09.914
He was a year ahead of me
at the Academy.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.843
Walked in on the scene and took a
bullet in the back of the head.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.711
.38 caliber.
Like the one in the bag.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.609
"The killers issued
a press release afterwards."

12:23.409 --> 12:26.049
"They apologized
for killing Perella."

12:26.679 --> 12:28.179
"Said they only took the money"

12:28.247 --> 12:30.317
"to slow down the 'immoral war
in Vietnam.'"

12:30.383 --> 12:33.023
Antiwar radicals.
The lunatic fringe.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.730
Well, no wonder
the F.B.l. kicked us out.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.458
They wanted this one
for themselves.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.943
Yeah? So do I.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.743
Did you know the officer
that was killed?

12:45.798 --> 12:47.398
No, but I went to his funeral.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.997
LOGAN: Four people were
involved in that crime.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.813
Susan Forrest, Margaret Pauley,

12:52.872 --> 12:54.682
both juniors
at Columbia University.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.551
Yeah. They got active
in the antiwar movement

12:56.609 --> 12:58.049
and went a little bit
overboard.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.991
Yeah,
helped along by these two.

13:00.046 --> 13:03.116
Tom Rudisill. Sam Burdett.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.489
Convicted armed robbers
on a study-release program.

13:06.552 --> 13:09.362
You know, that sounds like a
wonderfully progressive idea.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.422
It was the '60s, Mike.
You had to be there.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.131
I happened to be
at a couple antiwar rallies.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.867
Oh, yeah, to meet girls?

13:15.928 --> 13:18.408
Yeah, I heard hippie chicks
believed in free love.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.174
So did Rudisill and Burdett.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.153
They majored in sex,
drugs and rock 'n roll,

13:23.202 --> 13:26.082
and they got involved
in the antiwar movement, too.

13:26.839 --> 13:30.979
Rudisill was killed in a shoot-out with
police two weeks after the robbery.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.894
Okay. Burdett was arrested
as the accomplice.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.287
He's still in Sing Sing.
Good.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.959
Margaret Pauley was
underground for 12 years.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.498
They caught her
in a parking lot

13:40.553 --> 13:43.803
in a New Jersey shopping mall
in 1983.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.226
Copped a plea,
was paroled two years ago.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.932
That leaves Susan Forrest.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.334
She was pulled in for a line-up
the day after the robbery.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.207
She called in her lawyer,
stood mum,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.366
and the driver
couldn't identify her.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.635
She walked away.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.513
When the F.B.l. went back to
get her later, she was gone.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.252
She's been gone ever since.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.081
Twenty-three years.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.847
We'll have her by lunch.

14:06.145 --> 14:07.445
No prints on the gun.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.863
You hear from ballistics?

14:08.915 --> 14:11.355
Yeah.
It killed Officer Perella.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.831
No usable prints on the money.

14:13.886 --> 14:16.586
But I've got four
good sets on this card.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.136
The guy who used
the safe deposit box

14:18.191 --> 14:20.261
had to sign it
every time he came to visit.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.426
Any chance "he" was Susan
Forrest in a fake mustache?

14:23.496 --> 14:26.336
No. Three of the sets
belong to vault employees.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.739
One set's unknown.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.610
That would be
the fake Michael Cavanaugh.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.479
Yes. But he's not
in our files.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.046
All right, dead end.
Yeah.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.488
Let's go see
what's left of the old gang.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.380
The only cop I have to
talk to is my parole officer.

14:43.449 --> 14:46.449
You don't talk to cops,
you shoot them?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.616
Tom Rudisill shot him.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.428
I didn't even have a gun.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.400
It wasn't supposed to
happen that way.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.728
Oops, your mistake.
Yes.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.544
For getting involved
with macho creeps.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.126
Hey, nobody held
a gun to your head.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.505
We were trying to save lives.

15:01.768 --> 15:05.478
Do you know how many people were
being killed every day in Vietnam?

15:05.538 --> 15:07.068
Who you saving now?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.180
I mean, do I need
a bullet-proof vest?

15:09.442 --> 15:11.552
By the way, we found the money.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.061
What money?
From your mistake.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.323
It was in a safe deposit box.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.656
I haven't seen that money
since 1971.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.218
Well, who was
taking care of it?

15:20.286 --> 15:23.386
We're thinking maybe it was
your pal, Susan Forrest?

15:23.456 --> 15:26.026
I haven't seen her
since 1971, either.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.502
Did she have
any boyfriends back then?

15:28.561 --> 15:32.531
Yeah. Tom Rudisill.
May he rot in hell.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.737
I think when she said "macho
creeps," she was talking about you.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.880
Those girls,
they were live wires.

15:43.376 --> 15:47.476
Their plan was to give the
money to the Black Panthers.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.887
Yeah?
What was your plan for it?

15:50.883 --> 15:51.993
Different.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.132
How much did you find?

15:54.187 --> 15:55.717
More than 100 large.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.504
You can send my cut
to the prison store.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.340
Cigarettes for life.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.798
Who do you think
was tending it, Sam?

16:05.264 --> 16:06.374
(SIGHING)

16:06.432 --> 16:09.642
Well, it wasn't me,
'cause I was here,

16:10.436 --> 16:13.576
and it wasn't Tom,
'cause he was dead.

16:13.773 --> 16:18.053
Well, you knew the rest of the antiwar
crowd at Columbia. Any of them?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.618
Brave young students.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.459
Their idea
of living dangerously

16:22.515 --> 16:24.425
was to spend a night
in the faculty lounge

16:24.483 --> 16:26.193
and call it a sit-in.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.932
Tom "proposed our action."
That's how they talked.

16:28.988 --> 16:33.368
All the big mouths decided that
it was time to study for finals.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.413
Susan and Meg were the only ones
who had the stones to do it.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.474
"Meg"?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.940
We were close.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.850
Didn't she tell you?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.009
Margaret Pauley
and that scum-sucker?

16:49.075 --> 16:52.715
That beats Michael Jackson and Lisa
Marie for the Odd Couple Award.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.878
The '60s, Mike.
You had to be there.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.647
Oh, really?
What were you doing then?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.656
Touring with
Strawberry Alarm Clock?

16:59.218 --> 17:02.128
I was patrolling
the West Side in uniform.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.627
I got called in on some
of those student sit-ins,

17:04.690 --> 17:07.030
had to carry out kids
wearing cashmere sweaters

17:07.093 --> 17:09.633
and get called a pig
for my trouble.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.340
These kids sitting in,
were they arrested?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.900
Yeah. Trespassing,
conditional discharges.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.069
They were good little boys
and girls for six months

17:20.138 --> 17:22.638
and their records got expunged.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.588
Expunged, huh?
But not destroyed.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.490
Expunged records, pre-'78, never
made it to the main files.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.500
60s and '70s.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.103
If you find Jimmy Hoffa,
let me know.

17:36.155 --> 17:37.425
Wait a minute,

17:37.490 --> 17:41.230
Mr. Dawkins said you're the guy who
knows how to find things down here.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.574
Mr. Dawkins doesn't like
to come down here himself.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.699
Uh, we're looking for
Columbia University

17:45.765 --> 17:48.905
antiwar protesters,
like '70 to '71.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.608
That ought to
narrow it down a little.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.984
A little.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.683
Hope us taxpayers aren't
paying you by the hour.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.423
WILLIAM: I don't understand.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.430
BRISCOE: It's not that hard,
Professor Goodwin.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.622
What is it you teach?

18:04.684 --> 18:05.824
Comparative literature.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.185
Oh. Nice.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.733
Well, how's this
for comparative literature?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.099
We dug up
some old arrest records,

18:12.158 --> 18:15.298
including yours
from a 1970 campus sit-in.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.431
Why?

18:16.495 --> 18:19.595
To compare the fingerprints with
some prints found on a sign-in card

18:19.665 --> 18:21.765
for a safe deposit box
holding the money

18:21.834 --> 18:24.584
from the Nucon robbery in 1971.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.907
Do you remember that?

18:25.972 --> 18:28.282
Yeah. It was big news.
A policeman was shot.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.881
Yeah.
And the gun that shot him

18:29.942 --> 18:32.512
was found in that box, too.
Your box.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.058
LOGAN: Your fingerprints
are on the card.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.523
This has to be a mistake.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.621
Maybe we better talk this over
down at the station house.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.030
"Faculty dining pass,"

18:45.825 --> 18:47.855
"campus squash club."

18:48.227 --> 18:50.467
Boy, you had a real nice life.

18:50.997 --> 18:54.907
I think murder is grounds for
revoking your tenure, by the way.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.877
I had nothing whatever to do
with that robbery.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.107
You knew Susan Forrest.

19:00.172 --> 19:03.952
The two of you were "co-chairpersons"
of the campus S.D.S.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.616
A lot of people knew Susan.

19:05.678 --> 19:09.348
Yeah, but you see, you ended
up with the money and the gun.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.161
Help us, Professor.

19:13.219 --> 19:16.959
Or I promise you're gonna have
a really bad mid-life crisis.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.036
Susan brought me the bag.
She asked me to hold it.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.395
After the robbery?

19:24.463 --> 19:26.003
I didn't know anything
about the robbery.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.905
Well, what'd she tell you?
She won the lottery?

19:27.967 --> 19:29.607
She didn't say.
I didn't ask.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.739
BRISCOE: You rented that box
in 1971.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.505
Until 1981, you were there
at least once a year.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.494
What'd you do,
go in and not look at it?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.153
Susan called me
a week after the robbery.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.991
She asked me to send some money
to the policeman's widow.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.888
Oh, well, that's very
thoughtful of you.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.792
Everybody felt terrible
about that.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.265
Susan and Margaret,
they were underground.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.737
They'd call me when they needed money.
I'd get them some.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.166
How'd you deliver it?

19:58.230 --> 20:00.140
I parked next to them
in a parking lot

20:00.199 --> 20:01.699
at a shopping mall
in New Jersey.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.577
All right, cut the crap.
Where is Susan Forrest?

20:04.637 --> 20:05.837
I don't know!

20:05.905 --> 20:07.645
She stopped calling me
after a couple of years.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.047
I don't know why!
Margaret kept calling

20:10.109 --> 20:12.349
until I told her I wouldn't
go to that box anymore.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.221
We", Why'd you stop?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.617
They installed video cameras
at the vault.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.792
I was afraid
to get my picture taken.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.469
Some radical hero.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.161
Yeah, his girlfriends
take out an armored car.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.734
Here's his contribution
to the revolution.

20:28.194 --> 20:32.044
"The Whale is Red: A Neo-Marxist
Interpretation of Moby Dick."

20:32.965 --> 20:35.095
Do you think he knows
where Susan Forrest is?

20:35.167 --> 20:37.007
I think he'd tell us if he did.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.839
You know,
the professor delivered cash

20:38.904 --> 20:42.554
to Margaret Pauley
at a New Jersey mall.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.518
Two years after
he stopped helping her,

20:44.577 --> 20:46.387
she was caught
in the same place.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.185
She changed paymasters,
kept the same M.Jo..

20:49.648 --> 20:50.888
How was she caught?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.590
Just one of those things.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.891
Uh, a drunk plowed
into a row of parked cars.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.525
Margaret was sitting in one,

20:57.590 --> 21:00.430
got knocked unconscious and by the
time she woke up in the hospital,

21:00.493 --> 21:02.703
the police had figured out
who she was.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.742
LOGAN: A row of cars?

21:05.331 --> 21:07.471
Did the cop who wrote up
the accident report

21:07.533 --> 21:11.073
get the license numbers of the
cars parked next to hers?

21:11.203 --> 21:12.413
Yes.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.178
One was driven
by a tourist from Sweden.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.851
The other a green Mercedes.

21:16.909 --> 21:19.409
BDM 7291.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.018
Stuart Levitan, Larchmont.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.321
The new underground paymaster?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.187
Ask him.

21:27.753 --> 21:31.173
Margaret Pauley?
I never heard of her.

21:31.757 --> 21:33.927
Well, your car
was parked next to hers

21:33.993 --> 21:37.463
at the North Jersey mall,
April 12, 1983,

21:37.530 --> 21:39.100
when it was hit by a drunk.

21:39.899 --> 21:40.929
It was?

21:41.000 --> 21:43.280
Would you like to see
the police record?

21:43.335 --> 21:44.705
You're detectives
from New York City,

21:44.770 --> 21:47.750
and you're investigating a traffic
accident that happened in New Jersey

21:47.807 --> 21:48.907
11 years ago?

21:48.974 --> 21:51.724
Did you attend Columbia
University, Mr. Levitan?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.421
No. I went to Cornell.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.919
You active in the S.D.S.?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.980
S.D.S.? I'm a C.P.A.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.289
Who wants pasta for dinner?

22:00.486 --> 22:01.686
Stuart?

22:02.988 --> 22:04.988
They're detectives, Rita.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.774
I don't understand
how I can help you.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.026
I don't even understand
what it is you want.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.158
Susan Forrest?

22:14.133 --> 22:16.343
This is my wife, Rita Levitan.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.084
Miss Forrest?

22:20.906 --> 22:22.746
STUART: Who is Susan Forrest?

22:24.710 --> 22:26.780
Cuff her, Mike.
What?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.046
LOGAN: You sure?

22:28.113 --> 22:30.533
STUART: No.
What is happening here?

22:31.350 --> 22:32.850
Honey, go to Daddy.
Rita!

22:32.918 --> 22:34.298
BRISCOE: Susan Forrest,
you're under arrest

22:34.353 --> 22:35.663
for the murder of
Officer Vincent Perella.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.431
STUART: What's going on? You
have the right to remain silent.

22:37.489 --> 22:39.259
Anything you do say can and...
Rita, what is happening here?

22:39.325 --> 22:40.855
Mom! ...Will be used against
you in a court of law.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.526
Just tell them who you are, Rita!
Mom!

22:42.595 --> 22:43.725
Rita!

22:44.029 --> 22:45.239
Susan.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.143
My name

22:51.337 --> 22:55.337
is Susan Forrest.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.446
You have the right
to an attorney.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.861
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided...

23:00.913 --> 23:02.023
(DOOR CLOSING)

23:04.750 --> 23:07.030
SUSAN: You can't know
what it's like.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.959
For 23 years,
if somebody said "Susan,"

23:12.358 --> 23:14.338
I couldn't turn my head.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.970
My husband and son,
they wondered why

23:17.029 --> 23:19.169
I'd start crying
in the middle of dinner.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.378
You can have an attorney here.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.343
I just want this over.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.350
Every day...

23:31.110 --> 23:32.560
Every day

23:33.245 --> 23:35.725
I thought about
turning myself in.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.495
You found me
because of Margaret?

23:42.988 --> 23:46.368
Because your car was next
to hers in the parking lot.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.514
When Billy stopped helping
her, I'd give her money.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.314
I was married then.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.541
Your husband didn't know?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.212
No. He didn't know anything.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.311
I'd met him on a bus.

24:00.372 --> 24:04.052
I told him I was an orphan
from Wyoming.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.820
But now you admit taking part

24:06.879 --> 24:09.289
in the armed robbery
of Nucon Technologies?

24:18.924 --> 24:20.134
Yes.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.973
I was the lookout.

24:23.362 --> 24:26.742
And you were present when
Officer Perella was killed?

24:28.801 --> 24:30.641
Well, I was outside.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.453
I was throwing up
in the bushes.

24:33.505 --> 24:36.005
I was so scared.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.579
You knew Tom Rudisill
and Sam Burdett were armed?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.626
Nobody was
supposed to get shot.

24:42.681 --> 24:44.561
We were doing this
for a good reason.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.717
At least we thought
it was a good reason.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.186
I know that
that doesn't matter now.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.499
Can I call my family?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.371
Your husband's outside.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.699
No.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.605
My parents.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.447
(SNIFFLING)

25:05.904 --> 25:07.754
I was their only child,

25:10.476 --> 25:13.946
and they don't even know

25:15.814 --> 25:17.894
that they have a grandson.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.901
JACK: Get Susan Forrest's
lawyer in. We'll take a plea.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.601
You don't want to let her stew
in Rikers for a couple of days?

25:28.661 --> 25:31.511
She's confessed.
I don't foresee a problem.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.811
How far do you
want to drop this?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.606
She killed a policeman.

25:37.836 --> 25:41.046
She was a college kid
who was angry about the war.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.940
She was stupid and frightened,

25:45.878 --> 25:48.018
and she was duped
by a couple of convicts

25:48.080 --> 25:50.080
who pretended
to love Ho Chi Minh

25:50.149 --> 25:52.099
so they could get in her pants.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.788
I've never heard you make
excuses for a criminal before.

25:55.854 --> 25:58.804
It's not an excuse.
It's the way things were.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.938
Mr. McCoy?

26:01.593 --> 26:02.873
Yeah?

26:02.995 --> 26:04.595
I'm Mary Perella.

26:04.930 --> 26:08.210
I understand you've got one of the
people who murdered my husband.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.884
MARY: Vincent called me from
the precinct that morning.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.537
Finally got his
vacation approved.

26:15.641 --> 26:19.491
We were going to stay with my
sister at the Connecticut shore.

26:19.878 --> 26:21.288
I'm sorry.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.820
So was that other prosecutor

26:24.583 --> 26:27.263
who let Margaret Pauley off
with manslaughter.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.599
I'm sure he thought it was the
best sentence he could get.

26:30.656 --> 26:34.966
Eight years and she is out
planting tomatoes for poor people?

26:37.729 --> 26:40.229
I think there should be
a death penalty

26:40.733 --> 26:43.083
for her and for this other one.

26:51.910 --> 26:55.360
This is Officer
Vincent J. Perella.

26:57.016 --> 27:00.226
I wanted you to see him
before you make any deals.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.533
ADAM: Should have made
your deal yesterday.

27:03.589 --> 27:07.229
Susan Forrest just got rid
of the Levitan family lawyer.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.502
She's hired William Kunstler.

27:09.895 --> 27:13.735
From the Chicago Seven
to the Westchester One.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.579
He'll be onto 10 other causes
by the end of the week.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.305
Susan Forrest will be lucky to
get five minutes of his time.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.381
Five minutes of Bill Kunstler
goes a long way.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.081
When you were learning to walk,

27:24.143 --> 27:26.893
he and I were on the same
side of the courtroom,

27:27.112 --> 27:29.592
protecting protesters
from the government.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.858
Nobody protected Officer
Perella from Susan Forrest.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.728
Yes, but now
she's Den Mother of the Year.

27:36.121 --> 27:37.831
She bakes cookies
for the Little League.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.800
She's a prisoner of conscience.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.042
Get a deal.
You have her confession.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.604
And it's all we have.
After 23 years,

27:44.663 --> 27:47.303
evidence is lost,
witnesses are dead.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.466
That's how Margaret Pauley
got off with manslaughter.

27:50.536 --> 27:53.106
CLAIRE: Since when is
a confession not enough?

27:53.172 --> 27:56.482
If Susan Forrest had robbed
that armored car in the 1950s,

27:56.542 --> 27:58.322
I don't think I'd be hearing
all these reasons

27:58.377 --> 27:59.687
not to go after her for murder.

27:59.745 --> 28:02.225
I'm sure you've listened to all
The Doors' albums, Claire,

28:02.281 --> 28:04.781
but you just don't have any idea
what it was like back then.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.560
I can't prosecute Susan Forrest
because I wasn't at Woodstock?

28:07.619 --> 28:09.499
The whole country was at war.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.365
The President and the Attorney
General were breaking the law.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.565
Young people thought
they were a force in history.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.768
CLAIRE: Is that
how you felt, Jack?

28:20.365 --> 28:22.705
How many cops did you kill?

28:26.672 --> 28:28.172
(GATE BUZZING)

28:31.243 --> 28:34.283
I've reviewed your offer,
McCoy. We'll pass.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.646
JACK: Manslaughter one?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.894
It was good enough for
the Greenwich Village bombers

28:37.950 --> 28:39.190
who you represented.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.091
Yeah, but that
prosecutor had a case.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.723
We have a confession.

28:42.788 --> 28:44.288
Not anymore you don't.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.357
My motion to suppress.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.001
"Right to counsel"?

28:51.063 --> 28:53.043
I asked her three times
if she wanted an attorney.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.908
She said no. It's on tape.

28:54.967 --> 28:58.007
Yes, my dear, but you weren't
allowed to ask that question

28:58.070 --> 28:59.710
without me being present.

28:59.771 --> 29:02.621
Why? No one can have
a party without you?

29:02.908 --> 29:05.218
Miss Forrest was picked up
for questioning

29:05.277 --> 29:07.717
the day after the robbery
in 1971.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.623
I went down to the precinct
to represent her.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.662
When you picked her up
a month ago,

29:12.718 --> 29:15.058
I was still her lawyer
in this matter.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.470
She can't be asked to waive
her right to an attorney

29:18.523 --> 29:20.333
except in my presence,

29:20.626 --> 29:22.466
even after 23 years.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.072
I assume that you've read
People v. West?

29:26.398 --> 29:29.348
I have a new life now.
I have a son.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.419
You told me you wanted to make
amends for what happened,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.542
that it was the only way
you could feel healed.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.417
I... There's nothing else
for us to talk about.

29:38.577 --> 29:39.917
Susan?

29:42.147 --> 29:43.557
(DOOR BUZZING)

29:45.350 --> 29:47.800
Personally,
I think she is healed.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.865
You didn't pull the
police records from 1971?

29:57.396 --> 29:58.526
(SIGHING)

29:59.264 --> 30:00.404
I'm sorry.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.635
You should be.

30:03.568 --> 30:06.448
So we drop the charge

30:06.505 --> 30:10.645
and sing a duet of We Shall Overcome
as she leaves the courtroom?

30:12.711 --> 30:13.751
No.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.860
If the only option
Kunstler gives us

30:16.915 --> 30:18.515
is murder in the first degree,

30:18.584 --> 30:20.764
then that's what we'll take.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.789
What have you got?

30:23.455 --> 30:26.655
The armored car driver
is still alive,

30:27.826 --> 30:30.706
but he never saw Susan Forrest.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.036
He'll establish the crime.

30:33.298 --> 30:35.038
Sam Burdett puts her there.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.501
A convicted accomplice?

30:37.569 --> 30:40.179
His testimony
requires corroboration.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.745
Professor Goodwin links Susan
to the gun and the money.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.416
It should be just enough,

30:47.145 --> 30:50.815
if we sit the widow Perella
where the jury can see her.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.969
I drove the truck
in through that door there

30:58.523 --> 31:01.003
and backed it in to here.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.230
While we were
opening the doors,

31:04.763 --> 31:07.213
this Chevy pulls in
and blocks us.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.714
That girl was driving.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.273
Let the record show
that Mr. Giggins is pointing

31:13.338 --> 31:15.378
to a photograph
of Margaret Pauley.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.151
GIGGINS: Right. Her.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.777
Then these two guys
get out with a gun.

31:21.947 --> 31:24.327
They told us to give it up.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.259
That is,
to hand over the money?

31:26.318 --> 31:27.658
Yup.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.759
The girl in the car
got impatient, I guess.

31:31.356 --> 31:32.856
She started honking.

31:32.925 --> 31:34.365
JACK: What happened then?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.056
GIGGINS:
The policeman walked in.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.168
I guess he saw the Chevy.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.373
I never did find out.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.012
That one.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.648
He shot him.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.040
Thank you, sir.

31:51.309 --> 31:55.549
Mr. Giggins, did you see the
defendant, Susan Forrest, that day?

31:57.349 --> 31:58.519
No.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.433
She didn't shoot
Officer Perella, did she?

32:01.686 --> 32:02.716
No.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.668
Thank you.
No further questions.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.941
And what was Susan Forrest
doing, Mr. Burdett?

32:09.227 --> 32:10.497
She was the lookout.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.572
We dropped her outside before
we drove into the garage.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.312
JACK: She was there
the whole time?

32:15.367 --> 32:17.897
Yes, she was still there
when we drove out.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.610
Hopped into the car, on my lap.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.890
And she had participated in the
planning sessions for the robbery?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.353
Absolutely.

32:26.712 --> 32:30.492
She was all hot to strike a
blow against the war machine.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.923
Thank you, sir.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.456
Mr. Burdett, when you were
arrested after the robbery,

32:38.523 --> 32:40.593
didn't you deny
any involvement?

32:40.659 --> 32:42.069
I believe so.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.697
And in exchange for a deal,
didn't you agree to testify

32:45.964 --> 32:48.174
that Tom Rudisill
did it all on his own?

32:48.400 --> 32:49.640
Yes.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.081
And when Margaret Pauley
was arrested,

32:52.137 --> 32:54.377
didn't you first say
she wasn't there

32:54.539 --> 32:56.679
but that you might
remember it differently

32:56.742 --> 32:58.852
if the authorities
reduced your sentence?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.650
You got me again.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.656
And now comes Susan Forrest.

33:03.615 --> 33:04.885
Tell me,
what have you been promised

33:04.950 --> 33:06.950
for your testimony here today?

33:08.019 --> 33:13.029
Three weeks a year at the Adirondack
Prison Camp for my health.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.536
For your health?

33:16.094 --> 33:19.874
Mr. Burdett, if I were
to give you this watch,

33:20.599 --> 33:23.879
would you testify the judge
was present at the robbery?

33:23.935 --> 33:25.915
Objection!
Sustained.

33:25.971 --> 33:27.471
Mr. Kunstler.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.749
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.315
I would have hated to lose it.

33:36.114 --> 33:39.034
Starting in the spring of
1970, I spent most of my time

33:39.084 --> 33:40.934
in the student mobilization
against the war.

33:40.986 --> 33:43.686
And that's where
you met Susan Forrest?

33:44.523 --> 33:47.733
She was
an inspirational leader.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.699
And you became friends?

33:50.295 --> 33:51.535
We did.

33:51.997 --> 33:53.337
Did she come and see you

33:53.398 --> 33:55.968
the day after the Nucon
Technologies robbery?

33:58.770 --> 34:00.410
I don't remember.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.788
Do you recognize this bag?

34:18.356 --> 34:21.696
Let me refresh your
recollection, Mr. Goodwin.

34:22.092 --> 34:27.043
You told two detectives that
Susan Forrest gave you this bag.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.995
I don't remember.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.181
Permission to treat as hostile.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.911
Granted.

34:36.241 --> 34:40.821
Do you remember telling
Detectives Briscoe and Logan

34:41.213 --> 34:43.822
that Susan Forrest
gave you this bag

34:43.882 --> 34:48.092
containing more than $100,000
in cash and a handgun?

34:48.152 --> 34:50.033
What I remember is
the United States Government

34:50.088 --> 34:51.467
sending half a million troops

34:51.523 --> 34:53.943
to fight in a war it had already
decided it couldn't win.

34:53.992 --> 34:55.732
JUDGE QUINN: That's enough.
I remember the National Guard

34:55.793 --> 34:57.804
killing four college students
whose only crime

34:57.863 --> 34:59.543
was protesting the illegal
invasion of Cambodia.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.538
You are in contempt
of this court.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.050
Well, I cite this court with contempt!
Officer, remove him.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.853
I'm sorry, Susan. I should have
been with you 25 years ago.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.126
He had to wait until now
to impress Susan Forrest.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.630
He gets the time in prison
he always dreamed about.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.400
Big man on campus.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.228
ADAM: You have anything else?

35:29.160 --> 35:32.270
Claire's been through all
the original F.B.l. files.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.070
Down to the agents'
dinner receipts.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.412
What about the wiretaps?

35:35.901 --> 35:37.641
There weren't any wiretaps.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.512
They're holding back.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.978
In those days,
the F.B.l. wiretapped anybody

35:43.041 --> 35:44.681
who wore a paisley shirt.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.353
The White House
loved the technology.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.486
The Supreme Court
was less enthusiastic.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.316
Nixon.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.628
I'll call Washington.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.639
SUSAN:
Just got back from Virginia.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.931
TILLEY: That's Susan Forrest.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.443
TOM: How'd it go?

36:03.595 --> 36:06.165
That's the ringleader,
Tom Rudisill.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.065
Piece of cake.
We used Opie's I. D.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.501
We don't know who Opie was.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.206
Right on.
You get plenty of salt?

36:13.271 --> 36:15.081
Yep.
We're ready for the picnic.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.751
"Salt" means bullets.

36:18.643 --> 36:21.213
I want to be with you
tonight to celebrate.

36:21.279 --> 36:22.689
That's the adrenaline talking.

36:22.747 --> 36:24.387
Get your pretty little ass
over here.

36:24.449 --> 36:25.789
She was buying guns?

36:26.184 --> 36:28.064
Don't get too excited.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.863
These tapes
can't be used in court.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.168
You couldn't have
gotten a warrant?

36:33.124 --> 36:36.834
The President of the United
States said we didn't need one.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.506
Now this is the day
after the robbery.

36:41.266 --> 36:43.576
The police took me in for questioning.
You'd better split.

36:43.635 --> 36:44.975
Damn!
How'd they get onto you?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.706
I don't know.
I was scared.

36:47.138 --> 36:48.948
You did like I told you?

36:49.007 --> 36:51.037
I got rid of the bag.
I smashed the walkie-talkie

36:51.109 --> 36:52.779
and threw it down the sewers.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.454
So did Margaret.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.723
Unfortunately,
we didn't transcribe these

36:56.781 --> 36:58.761
until two days
after the robbery.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.427
We had quite a backlog.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.197
Susan Forrest's role
in the crime

37:03.255 --> 37:05.255
was a little more
than she let on.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.587
She bought the guns.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.729
And she and Margaret Pauley
had walkie-talkies.

37:12.530 --> 37:15.340
The driver said
Margaret honked her horn.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.000
He thought
she was just impatient.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.378
It was right before Officer
Perella walked in and got shot.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.878
In the back of the head.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.890
Rudisill was here
with the guard.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.012
He would have had to
duck back here

37:26.077 --> 37:28.217
to surprise the policeman
from behind.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.693
He was warned.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.088
Susan warned Margaret
over the walkie-talkie.

37:32.150 --> 37:33.320
Margaret honked.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.525
She said she was just
throwing up in the bushes.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.601
A bush with a view.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.703
I believed her, too.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.709
After 23 years,
she might believe it herself.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.832
How do we prove
what she really did?

37:47.966 --> 37:49.966
Margaret relayed the message.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.475
Well, Margaret hasn't been
very cooperative.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.377
For how many years
does she go back to prison

37:54.439 --> 37:56.679
if we prove
she violated parole?

37:57.309 --> 38:02.319
JACK: You told the police you hadn't
spoken to Susan Forrest since 1971.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.760
She told us
that she gave you money

38:04.816 --> 38:07.626
in the early '80s,
after she was married.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.815
Six months ago, Rita Levitan

38:09.888 --> 38:13.198
wrote a check for $500 to
the Women's Community Garden.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.258
We have a lot of contributors.
We're a good cause.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.967
You knew Rita Levitan
was Susan Forrest.

38:18.029 --> 38:21.029
All we have to show is that
she's talked to you one time

38:21.099 --> 38:22.809
since you've been on parole,

38:22.867 --> 38:25.367
you go back to jail
for six more years.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.317
Billy Goodwin just went
to jail to protect Susan.

38:28.373 --> 38:31.013
I spent my first two years
underground with her.

38:31.076 --> 38:33.416
We worked as waitresses
in rat holes,

38:33.478 --> 38:37.148
panicking if we accidentally drove
two miles over the speed limit.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.455
You don't think I'd go to
jail to protect her, too?

38:39.517 --> 38:43.557
Why? So she can go to white-glove
garden parties in Westchester?

38:43.621 --> 38:45.501
The same day
Susan gave you $500,

38:45.557 --> 38:48.937
she gave $2,000 to the
Republican National Committee.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.474
Republican National Committee?

38:52.464 --> 38:55.884
Pretty good cover for a radical
on the run, don't you think?

38:55.934 --> 38:58.074
JACK: What makes you think
it's cover?

38:59.237 --> 39:02.977
Her checkbook reads like a who's
who of conservative causes.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.185
Stuart Levitan has her
involved in his politics now.

39:08.413 --> 39:11.223
Have you ever been
a fugitive, Mr. McCoy?

39:11.950 --> 39:14.090
You do what you have to do.

39:15.286 --> 39:18.126
We can revoke her parole,
but she's loyal.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.929
Yeah. Army buddies.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.071
What about Susan Forrest?

39:22.127 --> 39:26.037
She's probably chartering a limo
to take her home from Rikers.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.004
You know she lied
about what happened.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.907
Throw it in her face,
see if she flinches.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.609
If she starts to say
something useful,

39:33.671 --> 39:35.711
Kunstler will stick his
handkerchief in her mouth.

39:35.773 --> 39:38.083
No. He'll be too busy
trying to figure out

39:38.143 --> 39:40.213
what you know
and how you know it.

39:40.278 --> 39:42.878
Bill hates to be
the one in the dark.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.694
I trust you won't keep us long.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.989
My client has a date
with a plastic tray.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.932
For the next 25 years.

39:49.754 --> 39:52.704
We know what happened at the
Nucon robbery, Miss Forrest.

39:52.757 --> 39:53.857
So do I.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.565
The violence launched
against the people of Vietnam

39:56.628 --> 39:58.508
finally redounded
to the home front.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.203
A tragic confluence of events.

40:00.265 --> 40:01.465
No.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.940
You warned Tom Rudisill that
Officer Perella was coming.

40:06.237 --> 40:09.477
If it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive today.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.611
(STAMMERING) No. I just...

40:11.676 --> 40:13.676
You tell a lovely
tale there, Mr. McCoy.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.815
I'm sure if you had someone
to tell it in court,

40:15.880 --> 40:17.920
we'd hear it there
and not here.

40:17.982 --> 40:20.592
You also bought the gun
Rudisill used.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.032
Gun sales leave a trace.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.257
I don't care if it's 23 years
or 230 years,

40:25.724 --> 40:29.904
I'll find that trace and link you
to the gun and send you to prison.

40:30.895 --> 40:32.765
Don't waste your time.

40:33.798 --> 40:34.898
Tell them.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.854
He can't be prosecuted.

40:41.372 --> 40:44.442
It was Billy Goodwin.
He bought the guns.

40:44.509 --> 40:45.779
Goodwin?

40:45.844 --> 40:47.194
It was legal.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.115
It made him feel important.
Like he was doing something.

40:50.181 --> 40:51.681
He was "Opie"?

40:54.352 --> 40:55.702
Kunstler's right about Goodwin.

40:55.753 --> 40:58.103
The most he can be
charged with is conspiracy.

40:58.156 --> 41:01.036
And the statute of limitations
on that ran out 18 years ago.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.662
Not if we argue that
his refusal to testify now

41:03.728 --> 41:06.298
is a continuation
of the original conspiracy.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.974
Get an arrest warrant
for the professor.

41:09.033 --> 41:11.013
You think that argument
will hold up?

41:11.302 --> 41:12.512
No.

41:12.570 --> 41:15.640
But until we're laughed out of
court, it increases the pressure.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.447
On Goodwin? He's already gone
to jail to protect Susan.

41:18.509 --> 41:21.419
Which is why Margaret
so admires him now.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.429
Margaret practically
spit in my face.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.621
That was before she had a
chance to think things over.

41:25.683 --> 41:27.593
Have her arrested, too.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.559
JACK: Ms. Pauley.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.304
I told you
I'm not gonna testify.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.429
I told you
I'd go back to prison.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.174
We can still pretend
this never happened.

41:39.297 --> 41:40.607
Let's go.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.105
CLAIRE: Have you seen
tomorrow's paper?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.197
Did I make the front page?

41:45.403 --> 41:46.643
Susan did.

41:51.442 --> 41:53.222
This is a trick.
Susan wouldn't do that.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.618
If you don't believe it,

41:54.679 --> 41:58.319
the officer can take you past
Professor Goodwin's cell,

41:58.383 --> 41:59.993
on the way to yours.

42:00.051 --> 42:02.291
Why are you doing this to us?

42:02.687 --> 42:06.787
The real criminals
killed 50,000 American boys

42:06.858 --> 42:09.028
and over a million Vietnamese,

42:09.093 --> 42:11.543
and they've never been
in a courtroom.

42:11.596 --> 42:14.336
Susan Forrest
isn't one of you anymore.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.843
Do you really want
to go to jail for her?

42:20.304 --> 42:22.614
She says Billy bought the guns?

42:29.948 --> 42:32.288
If he got within 10 miles
of a gun store,

42:32.350 --> 42:35.230
it was only because
he wanted to be near Susan.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.766
He loved her.

42:42.527 --> 42:44.337
(CRYING)

42:44.662 --> 42:45.942
So did I.

42:51.336 --> 42:54.176
JACK: Where was Susan Forrest
during the robbery?

42:55.640 --> 42:58.180
MARGARET: Susan was stationed
outside the gate.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.522
She was there the entire time?

43:01.946 --> 43:02.946
Yes.

43:04.449 --> 43:06.259
How do you know that?

43:07.485 --> 43:09.185
She and I were on
walkie-talkies.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.063
We were in touch
the whole time.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.102
Did Tom Rudisill
have any warning

43:13.157 --> 43:15.297
that Officer Perella
was approaching?

43:17.562 --> 43:20.302
Yes. I honked the horn.

43:21.566 --> 43:23.706
How did you know to do that?

43:25.002 --> 43:26.572
Susan saw him.

43:26.804 --> 43:28.884
And what did she tell you?

43:30.141 --> 43:31.851
She said he was coming.

43:31.909 --> 43:33.949
What were her exact words?

43:54.732 --> 43:56.232
"Pig at 3:00."

44:06.344 --> 44:07.584
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

44:08.846 --> 44:11.656
Kunstler wants to meet
as soon as possible.

44:11.716 --> 44:12.846
Yeah.

44:13.918 --> 44:17.058
He wants to accept the plea bargain
you offered before the trial.

44:17.121 --> 44:18.901
It's off the table.

44:22.393 --> 44:23.703
Isn't it?

44:25.396 --> 44:28.536
How much time in prison does the
Den Mother of the Year require

44:28.599 --> 44:30.369
to be rehabilitated?

44:31.769 --> 44:35.049
The policeman she shot
could have been your father.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.590
She didn't shoot anybody.

44:40.645 --> 44:42.215
What she said to Margaret.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.730
We knew she was there when
we made the original offer.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.658
How much more guilty does her
choice of language make her?

44:51.456 --> 44:53.366
It impressed the jury.

44:58.129 --> 44:59.469
UP '10 you.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.707
The offer was manslaughter one.

45:04.836 --> 45:06.706
We'll accept manslaughter two.

45:13.911 --> 45:15.291
Mr. McCoy...

45:19.584 --> 45:22.094
I couldn't tell anybody
what I did.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.888
I was ashamed.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.136
And all these years...

45:36.100 --> 45:37.600
I am so sorry.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.023
The offer was man one.

45:52.817 --> 45:54.317
Eight and a third to 25.

46:01.826 --> 46:02.926
Deal.

46:05.730 --> 46:06.830
Deal.

46:08.366 --> 46:09.536
Susan?

46:19.377 --> 46:20.817
(DOOR CLOSING)

46:23.781 --> 46:26.061
She'll be in jail till 2003.

46:31.823 --> 46:34.633
I think the '60s
should be over by then.
