Steven.
I know you're here.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.681
Come on out.

00:45.749 --> 00:48.818
- You know I can sense you.
- Steven bomb!

Whoa! I got you.

00:51.455 --> 00:54.657
- You got me.
- And now you're blind.

You ... reveal yourself!

01:48.145 --> 01:50.813
Top o' the morning to you, Garnet.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.383
Nothing like some morning training

01:53.384 --> 01:55.885
to get the blood pumping.
Am I right?

01:55.953 --> 01:58.688
Hopper, nice to see you, too.

01:58.789 --> 02:01.123
By the way, have you seen Hoppy?

02:01.191 --> 02:03.960
She was hoppin' excited
to train with us.

02:06.196 --> 02:08.648
Ya-a-a-a-a-h!

02:08.649 --> 02:11.100
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-h!

02:11.201 --> 02:13.219
Hyah!

02:13.220 --> 02:15.237
Garnet.

02:15.305 --> 02:17.840
- Hoppy.
- Wow, Garnet.

02:17.941 --> 02:19.659
I can tell you've been training.

02:19.660 --> 02:23.779
- Your power levels are hoppin' high!
- Yes, Hopper, but they could

02:23.847 --> 02:26.148
always be higher.
We should train more.

02:26.216 --> 02:28.417
I nearly had to jump on you that time.

02:28.518 --> 02:32.021
- Oooooooh!
- We can train some

02:32.089 --> 02:34.080
other time, Hoppy.
Right now there's a gem artifact

02:34.186 --> 02:37.126
- to recover.
- I wonder what it is this time.

02:37.194 --> 02:40.430
Maybe a magic power
amulet or a flying power

02:40.431 --> 02:43.666
carpet or maybe an
enchanted power onion!

02:43.734 --> 02:45.334
Whatever it is, we
should hurry.

02:45.402 --> 02:49.344
There's somebody at home
that I need to get back to.

02:51.375 --> 02:54.243
- Who is that?
- My most favorite

02:54.311 --> 02:57.747
- person in the world.
- Have you ever told him that?

02:57.848 --> 02:59.715
- No.
- Why not?

02:59.783 --> 03:01.884
I'm not strong enough.

03:01.952 --> 03:05.121
- Will we get to meet him soon?
- Not yet.

03:05.188 --> 03:08.758
He's not ready to learn that
I have secret animal friends.

03:14.164 --> 03:17.433
Whoa.

03:17.534 --> 03:20.336
His power levels are hoppin' pretty low.

03:20.404 --> 03:23.106
I can revive him.

03:29.112 --> 03:32.114
Ringo!

03:32.182 --> 03:34.350
Thank you for saving me!

03:34.418 --> 03:37.219
Tell us your name, stranger.

03:37.287 --> 03:41.257
My name is Ringo.
I am but a humble caretaker of

03:41.324 --> 03:43.809
the shrine atop Yonder mountain.

03:43.810 --> 03:48.397
How did you get those wounds?
Was it from some kind of training?

03:48.465 --> 03:49.749
Well, you see,

03:49.750 --> 03:54.585
<i>an innocent Fox man
wanted to see the shrine.</i>

03:54.620 --> 03:57.306
<i>Such a sweet, sweet Fox man.</i>

03:57.374 --> 04:02.278
<i>Naturally, I obliged.
Inside rested the sacred magic</i>

04:02.379 --> 04:04.797
<i>gem of ultimate power!</i>

04:04.798 --> 04:10.159
<i>It was then that the Fox man
double-crossed me.</i>

04:10.760 --> 04:14.423
<i>He used the power of the gem to</i>

04:14.491 --> 04:17.892
<i>banish me from my own shrine.</i>

04:17.961 --> 04:20.863
Ever since then, I've been
searching for someone strong

04:20.964 --> 04:23.432
- enough to help me.
- That gem must

04:23.533 --> 04:25.968
be contained. No one
should have that much power.

04:26.069 --> 04:29.789
Oh, you can have the gem.
I just want my shrine back.

04:29.790 --> 04:34.081
- We'll get it back for you.
- Hop five!

04:34.511 --> 04:38.280
Don't worry, Steven.
I'll be home soon.

04:40.744 --> 04:43.113
We're here!

04:47.858 --> 04:50.326
Holy hop!
His power is off the charts!

04:50.393 --> 04:53.462
Be careful, Garnet.
Don't hop off more than

04:53.530 --> 04:58.111
- you can chew.
- Fox man, give us the gem.

04:58.702 --> 05:03.405
What?
You again?

05:03.473 --> 05:05.491
Oh, I see what this is.

05:07.577 --> 05:10.679
If you want the gem, you'll

05:10.747 --> 05:13.549
- have to defeat me!
- So be it.

05:29.852 --> 05:34.270
See? I told you
he was strong. Ugh.

05:34.337 --> 05:36.939
Then we'll just have
to get stronger.

05:37.007 --> 05:38.974
Training time!

05:48.108 --> 05:48.884
Ringo!

05:48.952 --> 05:51.287
Ringo!

06:05.101 --> 06:08.571
<i>Weighted gauntlets.</i>

06:08.638 --> 06:12.174
Ugh!

06:12.242 --> 06:15.444
She just gained 10 power
from that one punch!

06:20.851 --> 06:22.585
Come on, Garnet.

06:22.652 --> 06:25.521
You can do this!
You've just got to remember

06:25.589 --> 06:27.790
what you're fighting for.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.527
Rah!

06:45.775 --> 06:48.694
7,000. 8,000. 10,000!

06:48.695 --> 06:51.614
Numbers have no meaning!

06:59.823 --> 07:04.460
- I'm ready.
- So cool!

07:04.527 --> 07:07.096
We're here!

07:07.197 --> 07:10.633
<i>- Ugh!
- Back again, huh?</i>

07:10.700 --> 07:14.370
Looks like you're hungry for
another delicious beating.

07:14.437 --> 07:17.106
Actually, that last
one spoiled my appetite.

07:17.173 --> 07:20.576
How dare you insult my
cooking skills?

07:20.677 --> 07:23.095
What?! Impossible!

07:29.764 --> 07:31.520
Oh, that hurts.

07:31.621 --> 07:35.457
- Now give back the gem.
- But I'm the sworn

07:35.525 --> 07:38.360
<i>protector of the gem.
What did that liar tell you?</i>

07:38.428 --> 07:42.264
- No!
- You dummies fell for it.

07:42.365 --> 07:46.602
Now the sacred magic gem
of ultimate power is mine!

07:57.514 --> 08:00.149
Ultimate Ringo!

08:00.250 --> 08:03.686
Curse you, Ringo!
I'll make you pay for this!

08:03.753 --> 08:08.424
Too bad you didn't outfox me
when you had the chance!

08:10.527 --> 08:12.328
- An on...
- ...Ion...

08:12.395 --> 08:16.598
Ring.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.500
We will avenge you, Fox man.

08:18.568 --> 08:23.706
- Ringo, you must be defeated!
- Ahem.

08:23.773 --> 08:26.709
The name's "ultimate Ringo."

08:26.923 --> 08:29.645
Wh-Wh-What is this place?

08:29.713 --> 08:32.030
Welcome to my Ringo zone!

08:32.032 --> 08:34.558
It is here where my powers are

08:34.559 --> 08:37.086
strongest.
You want to stop me?

08:37.153 --> 08:39.221
Go on.
It'll amuse me.

08:39.289 --> 08:43.256
And after I beat you, maybe I'll
destroy the planet

08:43.288 --> 08:46.729
<i>- just 'cause I can.
- You monster!</i>

08:46.796 --> 08:51.367
Ready to hog, drop, and roll!

08:51.468 --> 08:54.169
- Oww!
- Hoppy, no!

08:57.224 --> 09:00.209
Hoppy ... I mean, Hopper, no!

09:02.595 --> 09:04.913
Now, this is bad.

09:10.286 --> 09:14.648
<i>W-W-Weighted hair?</i>

09:14.683 --> 09:20.029
Without her weighted hair,
Garnet's power is hoptastrophic!

09:20.030 --> 09:23.365
- Ringo!
- Ultimate!

09:31.608 --> 09:34.206
<i>Garnet!</i>

09:34.744 --> 09:38.914
I'm sorry, Steven.
I wasn't strong enough.

09:39.015 --> 09:42.351
Ah, what a nice photo.

09:42.419 --> 09:46.522
But, you know, there's
something not quite right.

09:46.589 --> 09:49.008
Oh! I know!

09:52.885 --> 09:55.664
Nom nom nom nom nom.

10:01.837 --> 10:03.138
Huh?

10:08.378 --> 10:11.713
This is getting ridiculous!

10:11.781 --> 10:15.139
Ohh! Whoa!

10:15.140 --> 10:16.819
Chah!

10:29.439 --> 10:33.202
<i>Hip-hop hooray!</i>

10:33.269 --> 10:36.872
<i>And so Garnet used the gem to</i>

10:36.940 --> 10:39.541
<i>return the Fox man to his
original form.</i>

10:39.609 --> 10:43.145
<i>And as for Ringo
he stayed trapped in</i>

10:43.146 --> 10:44.914
<i>the Ringo zone forever.</i>

10:44.915 --> 10:48.096
<i>That day, Garnet learned
a valuable lesson ...</i>

10:48.201 --> 10:49.818
<i>that being strong was
about more than just</i>

10:49.919 --> 10:52.287
<i>how many mountains
you can punch in half.</i>

10:52.355 --> 10:55.858
<i>It was about love.
And there was no greater love</i>

10:55.959 --> 10:57.877
<i>than Garnet's love for Steven.</i>

10:57.878 --> 11:00.415
And then you came
back here and

11:00.511 --> 11:02.793
I got you and you
were blind, and that's

11:02.864 --> 11:05.667
- what you did today!
- Yeah, that's pretty

11:05.735 --> 11:08.737
- much what happened.
- Really?!

11:09.105 --> 11:10.406
No.
