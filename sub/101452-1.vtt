02:18.356 --> 02:22.293
<i>You will reach
your destination in four days.</i>

03:06.504 --> 03:07.670
Sorry.

04:45.269 --> 04:47.338
<i>The next storm
is already developing...</i>

05:48.798 --> 05:50.167
<i>The lucky winners</i>

05:50.301 --> 05:52.036

<i>...hungry to know the meaning</i>

06:11.589 --> 06:13.257

06:27.037 --> 06:29.739
<i>...as there were
necessary obstacles</i>

<i>to her ideal life of animals,

06:41.685 --> 06:44.555
<i>...not been an easy journey,

06:44.688 --> 06:47.824
<i>and had fled
from her adoptive parents.</i>

06:48.092 --> 06:51.295
<i>She would turn 42
that autumn...</i>

06:53.597 --> 06:56.900
<i>...a whole lifetime to explore.</i>

06:57.301 --> 07:01.872
<i>Sometimes the details didn't
seem to jive, of course.</i>

07:02.072 --> 07:05.142
<i>Sometimes names
were changed,</i>

07:05.276 --> 07:07.344

Move!

07:47.584 --> 07:49.353
Shit.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.494
Holy fuck.

08:09.173 --> 08:10.874
What the fuck?

08:33.097 --> 08:34.898
What the fuck?

09:08.732 --> 09:12.002
<i>...Fiona flings her body</i>

09:12.136 --> 09:15.973

- <i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>
- Hi.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.758
<i>Why don't you call the home
number and speak to Mom?</i>

09:36.293 --> 09:39.129
Because I wanted to talk
to you and not Mom.

09:39.263 --> 09:41.598
<i>Oh, um...</i>

09:43.700 --> 09:45.836
<i>well, any... any progress
with the bank?</i>

09:45.969 --> 09:47.237
Yeah.

09:47.371 --> 09:48.939
<i>Hey, look,
signal's kind of bad.</i>

09:49.072 --> 09:50.875
<i>Are you at home?</i>

09:51.008 --> 09:53.510
Actually, I... I left already.

09:54.044 --> 09:55.746
I just wanted you to know.

09:56.213 --> 09:58.849
<i>What? When?</i>

09:59.183 --> 10:00.852
This morning.

10:00.984 --> 10:03.654
<i>Oh, we were supposed to come
over and help you tomorrow.</i>

10:03.787 --> 10:05.022
I know, I know.

10:05.322 --> 10:08.158
I just wanted to avoid Mom
and the ensuing drama.

10:08.292 --> 10:10.127
<i>She's just worried about you.</i>

10:10.260 --> 10:11.930
<i>So am I.</i>

10:12.062 --> 10:13.831
I know. I'll be fine.

10:13.964 --> 10:15.799
<i>We just wanted to make...</i>

10:15.934 --> 10:18.669
<i>Oh, never mind.</i>

10:19.169 --> 10:21.038
<i>So how far are you?</i>

10:21.171 --> 10:22.840
I'm sorry.
What'd you say, Dad?

10:22.973 --> 10:24.374
<i>I... How far are you?</i>

10:24.508 --> 10:27.444
About 300 miles
from the house.

10:27.578 --> 10:30.113
<i>Boy, you must have been
moving along, yeah?</i>

10:30.247 --> 10:31.782
Yeah, I... I guess.

10:41.158 --> 10:43.494
Oh, I... I just wanted
to let you know.

10:43.627 --> 10:45.262
<i>Okay.</i>

10:45.395 --> 10:48.432
<i>Well, thanks for calling.</i>

10:50.601 --> 10:52.202
<i>Maybe we can come
and visit you</i>

10:52.336 --> 10:53.872
<i>when you've settled in a bit?</i>

10:54.004 --> 10:56.440
Of course, and...

10:58.008 --> 10:59.443
say hi to Mom for me.

13:52.315 --> 13:55.352
Sorry.

14:02.325 --> 14:04.661
- S... scared you?
- Yeah.

14:04.795 --> 14:07.731
It's okay, no worries.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.734
- Sure?
- Yeah.

14:13.938 --> 14:16.273
Uh, do you recognize me?

14:18.475 --> 14:20.544
No, not really.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.983
I'm driving that.

14:29.954 --> 14:31.155
Right.

14:31.488 --> 14:34.025
Yeah, I... I just wanted
to apologize for yesterday.

14:34.158 --> 14:35.093
I was texting.

14:35.225 --> 14:36.560
I didn't see you trying to pass.

14:40.530 --> 14:42.365
Well, it was a close call.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.871
Nah, I put my phone down, and...

14:47.604 --> 14:50.307
realized I was in a hurry,
and so I had to repass you.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.542
It was just one
of those days, you know?

14:54.912 --> 14:55.913
It's okay.

14:57.081 --> 14:58.315
What's done is done.

14:58.515 --> 15:01.585
But I scared you
a little bit.

15:01.752 --> 15:03.855
I... Look, I gotta go, sorry.

15:03.988 --> 15:07.591
- Do you live, uh, nearby?
- Uh, no, no, not really.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.393
Where are you, um...
where are you going?

15:10.995 --> 15:14.899
- I'm headed north.
- I'm always in the area, so...

15:16.800 --> 15:18.568
Do you...
uh, do you have a name?

15:20.570 --> 15:23.306
- Jessica.
- Jessica.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.410
I apologize again,

15:28.311 --> 15:29.279
and...

15:29.679 --> 15:31.015
I'll see you around.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.520
Yeah, yeah, it was...
it was nice meeting you.

15:36.653 --> 15:38.055
Nice to meet you, too.

15:38.822 --> 15:40.557
I hope you have a good trip.

15:40.958 --> 15:41.926
Thanks.

17:44.382 --> 17:45.883
Do you mind to open up?

17:53.490 --> 17:54.724
Hey, there.

17:55.558 --> 17:57.427
Hey, what's... what's going on?

17:57.560 --> 18:01.531
No idea.
The engine just died on me.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.334
It's a piece of shit.
What can I say?

18:03.868 --> 18:05.835
Yeah, that's... that's too bad.

18:06.037 --> 18:08.105
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

18:12.143 --> 18:14.312
You want me to call you a...
a tow truck?

18:14.946 --> 18:16.813
No, if... if you could just
give me a ride

18:16.948 --> 18:18.883
to the next town,
I can go to a gas station.

18:19.050 --> 18:22.086
But first, I need some help
to get the car out of the road.

18:24.788 --> 18:27.058
Look, I'm...
I'm just in a bit of a hurry.

18:27.925 --> 18:31.561
Yeah, I mean, me too.
I... it'll just take a minute.

18:32.096 --> 18:34.198
I'll push.
You can steer.

18:35.266 --> 18:36.533
Come on.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.440
I can check the GPS.

18:43.074 --> 18:46.010
- Excuse me?
- I can search on GPS.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.111
Why?

18:47.577 --> 18:49.246
I'll... I'll find
the next gas station.

18:49.380 --> 18:51.916
- I... I'll just give them a call.
- I know where it is.

18:52.116 --> 18:54.085
It's just up the road
about 15 minutes.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.752
Well, then I'll just go
up there,

18:55.886 --> 18:57.254
and I'll tell them
to come back and get you.

18:57.587 --> 19:00.523
Well, I do need help getting
the car out of the road first.

19:00.757 --> 19:02.692
It's a bit hard with this thing.

19:04.028 --> 19:05.662
I'm sorry, I've got to go...

19:05.795 --> 19:06.931
It's just gonna take a minute.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.265
I've got to go.
I'm late for a meeting.

19:08.399 --> 19:09.599
- I'm sorry.
- I just need a...

19:20.610 --> 19:22.380
<i>One night, when her eyes</i>

19:22.512 --> 19:24.781
<i>looked about the neighborhood
of the Palais-Royal</i>

19:25.216 --> 19:28.551
<i>doubtful to what amusement we
should next partake ourselves</i>

19:28.953 --> 19:31.621
<i>my friend proposed a visit
to Visconti,</i>

19:32.089 --> 19:34.492
<i>but his suggestion was not...</i>

19:34.992 --> 19:38.195
<i>...I knew Visconti,
and what I'm saying is...</i>

20:18.869 --> 20:20.971
<i>Hello?</i>

20:21.805 --> 20:22.973
<i>Jess?</i>

20:23.107 --> 20:24.108
Hi.

20:24.975 --> 20:26.977
<i>Sweetie, why'd you leave
without telling us?</i>

20:27.577 --> 20:28.913
<i>I don't understand.</i>

20:29.612 --> 20:31.082
Well, I woke up early,

20:31.215 --> 20:33.884
and I thought I might
as well get going.

20:34.452 --> 20:36.120
<i>Sweetie, I... I tried you
a few times,</i>

20:36.253 --> 20:38.189
<i>and I wasn't able
to get through.</i>

20:39.023 --> 20:40.790
I'm busy.

20:42.725 --> 20:46.330
<i>So...</i>

20:47.131 --> 20:48.665
<i>Are... are you there yet?</i>

20:49.233 --> 20:52.937
No...
I'd say sometime tomorrow.

20:58.042 --> 21:00.144
<i>Are you smoking again?</i>

21:01.778 --> 21:03.013
Nope.

21:09.353 --> 21:10.988
<i>So, um...</i>

21:12.256 --> 21:14.291
<i>Jess, have you called
the therapist yet?</i>

21:15.792 --> 21:17.461
Like I said, I've been busy.

21:18.395 --> 21:21.165
<i>I just don't understand
why you're leaving right now.</i>

21:21.332 --> 21:23.067
<i>After all that's happened,
wouldn't it be better...</i>

21:23.200 --> 21:25.202
Mom, we've been through this.

21:28.005 --> 21:29.874
<i>Why don't you want
to talk about it?</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:32.675
Because I don't need to.
I'm fine.

21:35.645 --> 21:37.414
<i>Really?</i>

21:40.384 --> 21:41.684
<i>Jess, come on.</i>

21:43.621 --> 21:46.056
- <i>Sweetie.</i>
- Really.

21:47.124 --> 21:49.360
<i>Well...</i>

21:49.493 --> 21:51.629
<i>...we just think it's
a really bad idea.</i>

21:52.129 --> 21:53.898
<i>You have friends and family</i>

21:54.031 --> 21:55.732
<i>who will support you
down here, sweetheart...</i>

21:55.866 --> 21:58.202
Well, I'm going anyway.

22:02.306 --> 22:03.740
<i>I just think
you should've stayed home</i>

22:03.874 --> 22:05.142
<i>until you felt
a little bit better.</i>

22:06.377 --> 22:10.114
It's been six months...
it's time to move on.

22:11.482 --> 22:13.716
<i>Okay, but promise me
you'll talk to someone</i>

22:13.851 --> 22:14.852
<i>when you get there.</i>

22:16.554 --> 22:17.988
I got to go.

22:18.189 --> 22:20.991
<i>Promise me. Please, Jess,
you need to promise me...</i>

22:21.158 --> 22:22.660
Mom, um, I got to go.

22:22.792 --> 22:24.161
I... I'll talk
to you later, okay?

22:24.295 --> 22:25.396
<i>Okay, but call me
when you get there.</i>

22:25.529 --> 22:27.264
Okay, bye.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.409
Hey, I just...

23:18.582 --> 23:20.251
All right.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.891
Fuck!

23:28.025 --> 23:29.326
Come on!

23:29.826 --> 23:31.395
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

23:34.064 --> 23:35.299
Hey!

23:35.599 --> 23:37.501
I was just trying
to go to the bathroom,

23:37.635 --> 23:38.801
and you almost hit me.

23:39.769 --> 23:42.006
What the hell's your problem?

23:42.139 --> 23:45.109
Hello? Hey!

24:29.953 --> 24:31.355
Pick up, pick up.

24:32.756 --> 24:34.191
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

24:34.325 --> 24:35.993
Hi, my name is
Jessica Swanson.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.928
I think I'm being followed.

24:38.062 --> 24:39.296
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.
Can you repeat that?</i>

24:39.430 --> 24:41.031
<i>We seem to have
a bad connection.</i>

24:41.165 --> 24:43.000
My name is Jessica Swanson.
I'm being followed.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.501
- <i>Who's following you?</i>
- I... I don't know.

24:44.635 --> 24:46.370
There's this guy, I've seen him
a couple of times.

24:46.503 --> 24:50.574
I don't know what he wants.
He's right behind me!

24:55.779 --> 24:57.047
<i>What is your location, ma'am?</i>

24:57.181 --> 24:59.350
I'm in my car!
Can you hear me?

24:59.483 --> 25:01.485
<i>Ma'am, please,
tell me your location.</i>

25:01.618 --> 25:03.153
Fuck, I don't know!

25:05.989 --> 25:07.524
I can't, I don't know!

25:11.829 --> 25:13.197
<i>Ma'am?</i>

25:14.098 --> 25:16.100
Oh, shit.

25:18.869 --> 25:20.371
I'm sorry, that's...

25:21.472 --> 25:24.308
- That was a false alarm.
- <i>It wasn't him?</i>

25:26.677 --> 25:28.045
No.

25:31.048 --> 25:32.383
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

25:32.516 --> 25:34.318
<i>I'll connect you
to one of the officers,</i>

25:34.451 --> 25:36.520
<i>and you can tell him a bit
more about your situation.</i>

25:37.254 --> 25:38.589
Okay.

25:51.835 --> 25:53.670
What the fuck is...

26:11.155 --> 26:14.591
Shit!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

26:28.839 --> 26:30.441
Fuck.

28:03.367 --> 28:05.569
Come on, come on.

28:20.417 --> 28:22.619
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

28:23.888 --> 28:26.356
Oh, no, no, stop.

28:26.490 --> 28:28.125
Get the fuck off me!
Get off me!

28:28.258 --> 28:30.093
Get off me!
No! Ah, fuck!

28:30.227 --> 28:31.461
Come here.

31:10.088 --> 31:11.655
Hey!

31:14.257 --> 31:16.660
Let me out!
Help!

31:18.129 --> 31:19.563
Help me!

31:22.666 --> 31:25.836
Help me!
Let me the fuck out of here!

31:26.104 --> 31:29.140
Let me out, please, please.
Please, I'm begging you.

31:29.339 --> 31:32.676
Please. Please!

33:18.916 --> 33:20.717
What do you want from me?

33:24.155 --> 33:25.388
What do you want?

33:27.591 --> 33:30.694
Is it money?
I can... I can get you money, I...

33:31.528 --> 33:33.264
Just tell me how much.
I can pay you.

33:33.597 --> 33:35.765
I promise.
Just tell me how much.

33:37.101 --> 33:38.635
Just tell me how much.

33:45.042 --> 33:46.911
You can let me go.

33:51.514 --> 33:55.086
I won't tell anybody.
I... I promise.

33:58.289 --> 33:59.689
I promise.

34:02.026 --> 34:05.395
Do you think you're
the first one to say that?

34:16.139 --> 34:17.909
Take your clothes off.

34:26.516 --> 34:27.952
Go on.

34:31.222 --> 34:32.621
You want some help?

34:36.592 --> 34:37.761
I just...

34:38.896 --> 34:40.998
need to use the bathroom first.

34:46.636 --> 34:48.072
Go right ahead.

35:47.465 --> 35:49.033
It's okay.

35:50.201 --> 35:51.735
There you go.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.574
I didn't even have time

35:57.707 --> 35:59.709
to cut all the way through
at the rest stop.

36:04.614 --> 36:07.118
Please just let me go.

36:07.852 --> 36:09.920
Almost gave up.

36:10.921 --> 36:13.991
Please.

36:14.125 --> 36:15.993
Let's see what we have here.

36:23.800 --> 36:26.203
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36:26.569 --> 36:29.373
<i>I am finally learning
how to do this trick.</i>

36:29.507 --> 36:30.640
<i>This is the only reason</i>

36:30.774 --> 36:32.009
- <i>I married this man...</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

36:32.243 --> 36:34.011
<i>Because he impressed me
with this trick.</i>

36:34.145 --> 36:36.047
- <i>Yeah, the only reason.</i>
- <i>The only reason.</i>

36:36.180 --> 36:39.517
<i>All right, can you take this?</i>

36:39.816 --> 36:41.118
<i>Pick a card.</i>

36:41.651 --> 36:43.120
<i>Um...</i>

36:44.922 --> 36:49.026
<i>Don't look, don't look.
Don't look, don't look.</i>

36:50.327 --> 36:52.662
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

36:54.331 --> 36:56.033
<i>Ooh-hoo.
What was that move?</i>

36:56.167 --> 36:58.369
- <i>What was that move?</i>
- <i>You just saw.</i>

37:00.204 --> 37:01.872
- <i>I'm watching you. I know.</i>
- <i>Uh...</i>

37:02.006 --> 37:03.706
- I know what's happening.
- <i>Abracadabra!</i>

37:03.840 --> 37:05.042
You're cute together.

37:06.877 --> 37:08.279
- <i>Where's my card?
- Oh, shit.</i>

37:08.546 --> 37:10.047
- <i>Where is your card?</i>
- <i>Where's my card?</i>

37:10.181 --> 37:11.916
<i>My card's supposed to be
in the middle.</i>

37:12.049 --> 37:13.250
<i>Wait, did I mess it?
Wait, no, there's your card.</i>

37:13.384 --> 37:14.717
<i>What!</i>

37:14.852 --> 37:15.652
You think he's worried
about you?

37:18.289 --> 37:20.757
<i>I fucked it up.</i>

37:21.859 --> 37:25.096
Hey...
I asked you a question.

37:59.762 --> 38:01.265
He left you.

38:04.869 --> 38:06.971
- Huh?
- He died.

38:09.573 --> 38:11.208
How?

38:13.776 --> 38:15.379
How did he die?

38:17.381 --> 38:19.917
He...

38:20.050 --> 38:22.319
He killed himself.

38:28.926 --> 38:30.327
In what way?

38:34.797 --> 38:38.903
A gun.

38:47.978 --> 38:50.147
And you found him?

38:56.887 --> 38:58.355
That's tough.

39:00.524 --> 39:03.294
That's tough.

39:08.765 --> 39:11.202
Aw, it's gonna be okay.

39:11.669 --> 39:13.770
It's gonna be okay.

40:27.144 --> 40:29.046
Come on!

40:30.681 --> 40:32.116
Ah, shit.

41:25.769 --> 41:27.304
Come on.

45:20.237 --> 45:21.338
Hey.

45:23.173 --> 45:25.609
No, no, I'm not
doing much right now.

45:26.310 --> 45:27.578
Just at the hotel.

45:27.778 --> 45:29.846
About to go get some lunch here
in a little bit.

45:31.615 --> 45:32.516
Oh, gosh.

45:32.649 --> 45:36.486
It is...
absolutely beautiful here.

45:37.087 --> 45:40.157
It's... it's so gorgeous.

45:40.290 --> 45:41.725
Looks out over the water.

45:43.126 --> 45:44.394
Mm-hmm.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.865
You and I should come here
some time.

45:49.901 --> 45:51.168
Yeah.

45:52.603 --> 45:55.839
Nah, the deal's just taking
longer than... than I expected.

45:58.076 --> 45:59.676
Um, I don't know.

46:00.477 --> 46:03.380
It looks like
it may be Wednesday.

46:04.247 --> 46:08.485
It just depends on when they
can make their mind up, yeah.

46:10.955 --> 46:12.222
Mm-hmm.

46:13.690 --> 46:16.961
No, we're just down
to some little detail on it.

46:17.394 --> 46:19.864
I think it's gonna be fine.
Yeah.

46:21.032 --> 46:22.165
Mm-hmm.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.268
And how's Mina?

46:27.972 --> 46:29.139
Yeah.

46:30.875 --> 46:33.343
Yeah, just...
I guess just make sure

46:33.477 --> 46:35.880
she doesn't have any more milk
until we know for sure.

46:37.314 --> 46:38.515
Uh-huh.

46:39.616 --> 46:42.285
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me talk to her.

46:46.757 --> 46:48.325
Hey, little bug.

46:50.427 --> 46:53.430
Aw, I miss you, too,
sweetheart.

46:55.565 --> 46:57.768
Yeah, how's the stomach?

47:00.537 --> 47:01.805
Yeah, Mom told me,

47:01.939 --> 47:05.877
but you are gonna be
just fine real soon.

47:06.309 --> 47:08.980
I promise.
Uh-huh.

47:09.680 --> 47:13.483
I think that I'm gonna see you
in a couple of days,

47:13.885 --> 47:16.820
but you're probably gonna be
asleep when I get home.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.423
I love you, too.

47:20.925 --> 47:23.727
All right, bye.
And let me talk to Mom first.

47:24.062 --> 47:25.429
Bye.

47:26.463 --> 47:29.533
Yeah.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.903
No, I know.

47:33.236 --> 47:37.374
All right, let me, uh, let me
give you a call tomorrow,

47:37.507 --> 47:39.676
and I'll let you know
how it's looking.

47:41.511 --> 47:43.513
Okay.
Love you, babe.

47:44.214 --> 47:45.983
All right, bye.

49:04.262 --> 49:07.697
Help me!
Oh, God.

49:10.467 --> 49:11.835
Oh, God.

53:16.480 --> 53:20.084
Mm.

54:46.170 --> 54:47.371
- No!
- Back off!

54:47.505 --> 54:49.340
Get down on your knees.

54:51.375 --> 54:54.044
Please. I'm sorry.
You have to help me.

54:54.311 --> 54:58.015
Please, I need you
to help me right now.

54:58.648 --> 55:01.318
Fuck! What the hell is going on?

55:02.119 --> 55:03.621
We have to get out of here.

55:04.388 --> 55:06.557
- Let's go...
- You stay right where you are.

55:06.689 --> 55:08.926
No, someone is trying
to kill me.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.861
- What?
- He's crazy.

55:10.995 --> 55:13.397
He's completely fucking crazy.

55:13.663 --> 55:17.834
Please, do you have a phone?
Anything, please?

55:21.539 --> 55:23.274
Anything?

55:23.874 --> 55:25.075
Hang on.

55:27.611 --> 55:29.013
Oh, shit.

55:35.419 --> 55:38.355
I got to get out of here.
Please get me out of here.

55:41.525 --> 55:42.960
What'd you do to your foot?

55:44.061 --> 55:45.262
I stepped on a root.

55:49.133 --> 55:52.303
I have some...
extra boots in the car.

55:53.504 --> 55:54.939
Back that way.

55:59.076 --> 56:00.743
Don't try anything with that.

56:02.146 --> 56:03.147
I won't.

56:03.681 --> 56:05.049
Now come on.

56:05.950 --> 56:07.284
Okay.

56:42.119 --> 56:43.387
These are my wife's.

56:43.753 --> 56:46.357
They're probably too big,
but better that than too small.

56:46.523 --> 56:47.658
- Right?
- Thank you.

56:58.035 --> 56:59.970
Well, let's get out of here.

57:47.584 --> 57:48.952
You okay?

57:51.588 --> 57:52.956
Yeah.

57:54.591 --> 57:55.825
I'm fine.

57:57.695 --> 57:59.563
When was the last time
you had anything to eat?

58:05.069 --> 58:06.904
I don't remember.

58:07.037 --> 58:08.806
There's some sandwiches
in the backpack.

58:08.939 --> 58:10.374
You can help yourself.

58:16.447 --> 58:19.316
Goat cheese and honey,
if that's all right.

58:20.617 --> 58:23.120
My wife makes
a killer sandwich.

58:35.265 --> 58:37.401
There should be some water
in there.

59:02.926 --> 59:04.495
You think he's still out there?

59:07.197 --> 59:08.499
Maybe.

59:12.069 --> 59:13.670
I think he's long gone.

59:13.804 --> 59:15.305
He's probably somewhere

59:15.439 --> 59:18.609
trying to think up an alibi.

59:21.011 --> 59:23.380
Oh, God.
What's this?

59:28.619 --> 59:30.554
No, no, no!

59:30.687 --> 59:32.589
- Jessica, Jessica, calm down!
- No, this is him!

59:37.594 --> 59:41.198
No, no, no.

59:45.836 --> 59:47.137
You have to help me.

59:47.404 --> 59:49.573
Jessica, you're never
gonna be able to move that.

59:50.073 --> 59:51.742
Come on. Come on.

59:52.142 --> 59:54.511
One, two, three.

59:56.113 --> 59:58.148
Oh, come on.
This is not gonna go anywhere.

59:58.282 --> 01:00:00.050
Push!

01:00:01.051 --> 01:00:02.586
Ah, fuck.

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:05.155
Is there any other way
out of here?

01:00:05.289 --> 01:00:06.590
How do I know?

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:21.305
That's him.

01:00:21.438 --> 01:00:24.308
No, no!
You let me handle this.

01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:25.843
- He will kill me.
- I'll handle this.

01:00:25.976 --> 01:00:28.479
You get back over there.
Back up against the tree.

01:00:32.282 --> 01:00:35.319
No, no.
Thank God, no.

01:00:35.452 --> 01:00:37.688
No, she's...
she's standing here.

01:00:38.021 --> 01:00:40.357
Okay, yeah.
No, she's with somebody.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:42.392
Okay, thank you so much,

01:00:42.526 --> 01:00:45.529
and I'm so sorry that we had
to bother you with this again.

01:00:45.897 --> 01:00:48.031
Okay, I will.
All right, bye.

01:00:49.766 --> 01:00:50.969
Jess, for God's sake.

01:00:51.301 --> 01:00:53.070
- Get the fuck away from me!
- Jess, please.

01:00:53.203 --> 01:00:55.439
Look, what is...
what is going on here?

01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:58.141
Sir, you're gonna have
to excuse my sister.

01:00:58.275 --> 01:00:59.543
She's not feeling well.

01:00:59.676 --> 01:01:02.179
I am not your sister,
you fucking psycho!

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.449
I found her
about a half hour ago.

01:01:05.616 --> 01:01:08.252
- She says you kidnapped her.
- Oh, God, no.

01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:11.421
She had one of her episodes,
and before I knew it,

01:01:11.555 --> 01:01:14.391
she was out of the house, and
she had jumped in the river.

01:01:14.725 --> 01:01:15.860
Don't you believe him.

01:01:15.994 --> 01:01:17.427
- Look, all right, um...
- Jess, that's enough.

01:01:17.561 --> 01:01:19.998
Obviously, we...
we have a situation here.

01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:22.366
Oh, God.
W... what else did she say?

01:01:22.733 --> 01:01:24.635
She said you locked her
in a basement?

01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:26.069
Jesus.

01:01:27.538 --> 01:01:28.605
Jess...

01:01:29.941 --> 01:01:31.141
Listen.

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:33.243
We've had a...

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:36.713
a tragedy
in our family recently,

01:01:37.247 --> 01:01:40.350
and her...
her husband killed himself.

01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:42.185
Shut up, you sick fuck.

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:43.855
Now she's developed
these triggers,

01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:47.090
and one second, she's fine, and
then the next, she goes off.

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:49.626
Is she seeing a doctor?

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.962
E... every Tuesday.

01:01:51.094 --> 01:01:53.063
He's lying.
He's fucking lying.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:56.466
Listen, I just got off
the phone with the police

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.168
and called off the search.

01:01:58.302 --> 01:02:00.203
This is not the first time
that this has happened...

01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:01.471
- He's crazy.
- Get back.

01:02:01.605 --> 01:02:03.273
Get back.
Over there.

01:02:03.407 --> 01:02:05.642
I'm sorry, sir.
W... what's your name?

01:02:05.776 --> 01:02:06.810
Robert.

01:02:07.110 --> 01:02:09.513
I can't begin to thank you
for what you've done.

01:02:09.646 --> 01:02:11.315
Now that he's seen you,

01:02:11.448 --> 01:02:14.151
he's never gonna let you
out of here alive, never.

01:02:14.284 --> 01:02:17.154
Jessica, that is
enough for today.

01:02:18.155 --> 01:02:19.456
Come on.

01:02:19.756 --> 01:02:21.859
If you could just help me
get her in the car first.

01:02:22.192 --> 01:02:24.963
No, no! No!

01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:27.999
No! Help me!

01:02:28.131 --> 01:02:29.232
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.

01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:30.701
- Help me!
- You're okay.

01:02:30.902 --> 01:02:33.004
Can you give me a hand?

01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:34.438
- Ask for his phone!
- What?

01:02:34.571 --> 01:02:36.473
- Stop.
- Ask for his fucking phone!

01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:38.442
- Let me just...
- No!

01:02:38.642 --> 01:02:41.111
Ask for his phone
and call the police!

01:02:41.244 --> 01:02:44.181
No, no!

01:02:44.414 --> 01:02:46.017
- Excuse me.
- What?

01:02:46.783 --> 01:02:48.318
Can I borrow
your phone, please?

01:02:48.452 --> 01:02:50.821
Fuck! Ouch!

01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:52.623
You stop!

01:02:56.593 --> 01:02:58.863
- Could you grab her, please?
- No, she's right.

01:02:59.496 --> 01:03:00.697
I need to call the police

01:03:00.831 --> 01:03:02.366
and make sure
everything checks out.

01:03:02.499 --> 01:03:03.767
It's... it's gonna make me
feel a lot better.

01:03:03.901 --> 01:03:05.802
Okay, but could you
please just help me

01:03:05.937 --> 01:03:06.938
get her in the car first?

01:03:07.071 --> 01:03:07.972
Phone.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.508
- You want to see my phone?
- Yes.

01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:16.213
Sure, if that's gonna
make you feel better.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.915
Here you go.

01:03:18.815 --> 01:03:22.386
Watch out!

01:03:22.519 --> 01:03:25.188
Stop!

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:43.480
I know you're close.

01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:49.486
I know I hit you.

01:07:57.794 --> 01:08:00.497
I give you about two hours...

01:08:01.631 --> 01:08:03.433
before you bleed to death.

01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:13.010
Soon the cramps will set in...

01:08:16.613 --> 01:08:18.814
spreading through your body...

01:08:21.953 --> 01:08:24.520
and then the rot will start.

01:08:30.294 --> 01:08:33.898
Why don't you come out
and fight while you still can?

01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:39.769
Yeah, I'll play fair.

01:09:00.191 --> 01:09:01.892
It's loaded.

01:09:06.397 --> 01:09:09.666
You have one minute...

01:09:11.734 --> 01:09:13.170
to try and grab it...

01:09:15.439 --> 01:09:16.606
starting...

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:18.707
now.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.982
Are you too scared?

01:09:27.684 --> 01:09:30.187
You know the one thing
I can't stand?

01:09:34.024 --> 01:09:35.091
Cowards!

01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:43.666
Just like that husband
of yours.

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:48.139
Why did he kill himself anyway?

01:09:50.241 --> 01:09:51.608
Was he too weak?

01:09:54.378 --> 01:09:55.379
You know...

01:09:56.247 --> 01:09:59.316
people who are thinking
about killing themselves...

01:10:01.751 --> 01:10:05.688
They usually cry out for help.

01:10:07.557 --> 01:10:11.429
They send these subtle signals

01:10:11.561 --> 01:10:13.830
to their family and friends.

01:10:15.598 --> 01:10:19.103
That must just really
tear you apart.

01:10:26.077 --> 01:10:27.211
Knowing...

01:10:28.711 --> 01:10:30.147
that he...

01:10:34.684 --> 01:10:37.188
probably tried to tell you.

01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:44.794
That guilt must be
something else.

01:10:49.533 --> 01:10:54.071
He was supposed to be
the father of your children,

01:10:54.271 --> 01:10:55.805
and now...

01:10:56.874 --> 01:11:00.144
he's rotting
in some grave somewhere.

01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:08.319
All that sorrow...

01:11:10.387 --> 01:11:11.754
all that guilt...

01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:17.394
would drive me nuts
if I were you.

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:23.267
Completely fucking nuts.

01:11:28.372 --> 01:11:30.875
He was a coward.

01:11:33.878 --> 01:11:36.347
I know fear when I see it.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.183
It's all in the eyes!

01:11:40.783 --> 01:11:43.087
It's all in the fucking eyes!

01:11:51.428 --> 01:11:53.497
People think they can hide it,

01:11:53.631 --> 01:11:54.965
but they can't!

01:11:55.566 --> 01:11:57.168
Not from me!

01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:02.940
Prove to me that I'm wrong!

01:12:04.508 --> 01:12:06.877
Show me some fucking guts!

01:12:08.212 --> 01:12:10.281
Show me you're just
a little bit better

01:12:10.414 --> 01:12:12.983
than that shitbag husband
of yours!

01:12:17.555 --> 01:12:19.056
Do you hear me?

01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.199
Do you fucking hear me?

01:12:32.835 --> 01:12:34.538
I'm gonna get you,

01:12:34.672 --> 01:12:37.174
you delicious fucking bitch!

01:12:42.779 --> 01:12:44.882
I'm coming for you.

01:12:49.486 --> 01:12:52.223
I am coming for you.

01:18:41.738 --> 01:18:43.240
Come on.

01:23:25.223 --> 01:23:27.091
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:23:27.225 --> 01:23:28.725
Help me.

01:23:29.826 --> 01:23:30.760
<i>Hello?</i>

01:23:31.329 --> 01:23:33.331
Help me.

01:23:33.463 --> 01:23:34.966
<i>You need to speak up.</i>

01:23:36.499 --> 01:23:38.368
There's a man in glasses.

01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:39.971
I've been kidnapped.

01:23:40.137 --> 01:23:42.139
<i>I'm sorry.
Can you repeat that?</i>

01:23:43.107 --> 01:23:46.376
He's going to kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:49.379
- <i>Who's trying to...</i>
- Just trace this call.

01:23:49.646 --> 01:23:52.382
<i>Hello? I can't hear you.</i>

01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:55.752
Trace this call.

01:25:00.017 --> 01:25:01.484
Bitch!

01:27:24.895 --> 01:27:28.265
Hey.

01:29:17.942 --> 01:29:20.411
- <i>Hi, Daddy.</i>
- Can I talk to your mom?

01:29:20.644 --> 01:29:21.679
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:29:21.946 --> 01:29:23.414
Please let me talk
to your mom.

01:29:24.048 --> 01:29:26.517
<i>Mom, someone wants
to talk to you.</i>

01:29:26.984 --> 01:29:28.352
<i>This is Catherine Dillon.</i>

01:29:28.485 --> 01:29:30.354
This is
your husband's phone, right?

01:29:30.688 --> 01:29:31.956
- <i>I'm sorry?</i>
- Right?

01:29:32.089 --> 01:29:33.891
<i>Yeah, but who are you?</i>

01:29:35.159 --> 01:29:36.560
Do you know
where he is right now?

01:29:36.994 --> 01:29:38.596
<i>I don't know
what you're talking about...</i>

01:29:38.728 --> 01:29:40.130
I asked you
a fucking question.

01:29:41.031 --> 01:29:43.400
Do you know
where he is right now?

01:29:43.534 --> 01:29:45.669
<i>My husband is in California
on a business trip...</i>

01:29:45.802 --> 01:29:48.771
- No, he's not.
- <i>I'm...</i>

01:29:49.039 --> 01:29:53.077
He's a kidnapper...
and a murderer.

01:29:53.277 --> 01:29:55.613
<i>Is this some kind of joke?
If it is...</i>

01:29:55.812 --> 01:29:57.780
No, it's not a fucking joke!

01:29:58.748 --> 01:30:02.886
- <i>Sam, are you there?</i>
- You want to talk to him?

01:30:03.087 --> 01:30:06.090
Here, hold on a second.
I'll put him on.

01:30:07.558 --> 01:30:08.993
You have a phone call.

01:30:09.727 --> 01:30:12.129
<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

01:30:14.198 --> 01:30:17.668
<i>Sam...
what the hell is going on?</i>

01:30:17.935 --> 01:30:20.504
<i>Sam?
Talk to me.</i>

01:30:20.904 --> 01:30:22.940
My name is Jessica Swanson...

01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:27.344
and if this is the last time
you hear from me,

01:30:28.045 --> 01:30:30.180
it's because your husband
killed me,

01:30:31.115 --> 01:30:33.284
just like he killed a man
named Robert.

01:30:34.451 --> 01:30:36.453
People are probably looking
for him, too.

01:30:36.854 --> 01:30:38.088
<i>Sam!</i>

01:30:38.589 --> 01:30:41.225
Go on. Go on!

01:30:42.593 --> 01:30:43.961
Talk to your wife!

01:30:44.895 --> 01:30:46.897
<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:52.069
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:30:53.037 --> 01:30:55.306
I just need
to take care of something.

01:30:55.838 --> 01:30:58.942
<i>Are you there? Sam!</i>

01:31:00.778 --> 01:31:03.247
<i>Sam, are you there?</i>

01:31:03.813 --> 01:31:05.115
<i>Sam!</i>

01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:07.017
Bye.
