We thank God for our blessings

00:49.341 --> 00:52.178
Our little family is so loving
and perfect,

00:52.303 --> 00:54.388
and nothing will ever
tear us apart.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.683
I'll get it.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.103
Gerald Broflovski?

01:01.228 --> 01:02.063
Yes.

01:02.188 --> 01:04.565
My name is Harry Gints,
and this is my wife, Elise.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.192
We're from Canada.

01:06.317 --> 01:07.651
Yes.
I can tell.

01:07.777 --> 01:10.029
My wife and I had a child
a few years back,

01:10.154 --> 01:11.989
and we weren't ready
to have a child,

01:12.114 --> 01:13.532
so we put him up for adoption.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.034
We were told that you
might be the --

01:15.159 --> 01:17.870
Peter!
Oh, God, Harry! It's our son!

01:17.995 --> 01:20.039
Peter, it's Mommy.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.083
Gerald, what the hell
is going on?

01:22.208 --> 01:24.251
Uh, I'm not sure.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.087
It was a tough time for us.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.755
It was a tough time
for all of Canada.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.508
The whole country was devastated
by the Cola Wars.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.593
It just seemed we couldn't
take care of a baby.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.054
So we put him up for adoption,
but as the years passed,

01:35.179 --> 01:37.556
I-I just felt an emptiness
in my heart.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.725
Oh, it's so good to see him!

01:39.850 --> 01:42.603
Well, we wish you all the best,
Mr. And Mrs. Gints.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.481
But to be honest,
I think it would be best for Ike

01:45.606 --> 01:47.650
if you didn't come around again.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.401
I don't think you understand.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.070
We didn't come to visit Peter.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.696
We came to take him back.

01:52.822 --> 01:53.781
What?

01:53.906 --> 01:56.075
We want to take Peter home
to Canada.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.243
Are you crazy?!

01:57.368 --> 01:58.869
Look, you gave Ike up.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.663
You can't just change your mind!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.289
Changing your mind
is a Canadian custom

02:02.414 --> 02:03.457
that we hold quite dear.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.584
And besides, the new
Canadian prime minister

02:05.709 --> 02:07.711
has issued a decree
that all adopted Canadians

02:07.837 --> 02:09.421
must be returned home.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.382
The new Canadian prime minister?

02:11.507 --> 02:13.425
Look, Ike is our son now!

02:13.551 --> 02:14.927
He doesn't belong here.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.012
He belongs in Canada
with his own kind.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.472
I think you'd better leave.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.141
Please, don't make this
any harder for Peter.

02:20.266 --> 02:21.517
Harder for Peter?!

02:21.642 --> 02:22.810
You two just blow in here

02:22.935 --> 02:24.645
and say you're gonna
haul him back to Canada,

02:24.770 --> 02:26.480
and <i>we 're</i> being hard on Peter?!

02:26.605 --> 02:27.523
We're prepared to go to court.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.941
We had hoped it wouldn't come
to that.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.235
Well, you bet your ass
it'll come to that!

02:33.237 --> 02:35.447
I'm sorry to say
that my hands are tied.

02:35.573 --> 02:36.907
The new prime minister of Canada

02:37.032 --> 02:39.160
has authority
this court cannot override.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.954
By Canadian law, I must
award custody of the child

02:42.079 --> 02:43.372
to his birth parents.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.249
Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

02:45.374 --> 02:46.000
No!

02:46.125 --> 02:48.252
Ike's not my little brother
anymore?

02:48.377 --> 02:49.628
Gerald, do something!

02:49.753 --> 02:51.297
There's nothing I can do.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.342
Goodbye, Ike.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.095
You...be a good boy, huh?

02:58.220 --> 03:01.682
You -- You remember all
the things we taught you.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.687
Ike...you'll always be
my little brother, okay?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.522
Come on, Peter.
We should get going.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.482
No.

03:10.608 --> 03:12.109
Peter, you must come with Mommy
and Daddy.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.195
No, no, no, no, no!

03:14.320 --> 03:16.405
I have some chocolate.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.157
Chocolate!

03:19.909 --> 03:21.493
We're going to take good care
of him.

03:21.619 --> 03:22.828
You'd better.

03:34.215 --> 03:37.051
Dad? Can't we talk to this new
Canadian prime minister?

03:37.176 --> 03:38.719
If he knew the situation,
he might --

03:38.844 --> 03:41.639
Oh, Kyle, appealing to
the prime minister of Canada

03:41.764 --> 03:45.476
would take time and money
we don't have.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.272
Dude, look at that.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.317
The Sprinkle Time Make Your Own
Marshmallow Factory.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.569
I'm definitely asking for that
for Christmas.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.655
I'm gonna tell my parents to get
me that John Elway doll

03:57.780 --> 04:00.324
with the karate-chop action.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.243
Guys.
Guys, I need your help.

04:02.368 --> 04:03.285
Sure, dude.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.995
It's been a week
since Ike's been gone,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.580
and every day my parents
seem worse.

04:06.705 --> 04:07.998
I have to try to go to Canada

04:08.123 --> 04:09.917
and speak with the new
Canadian prime minister.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.126
But I can't do it alone.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.420
We can't go to Canada, dumb-ass!
It's Christmas!

04:13.545 --> 04:16.090
Yeah. What if we miss out on
some great Christmas adventure?

04:16.215 --> 04:17.800
Please, you guys.
You don't understand.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.176
My family is devastated.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.095
My mom just walks around
the house like a zombie,

04:21.220 --> 04:22.846
and my dad can't stop crying.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.598
Well, I didn't want to say
anything, Kyle,

04:24.723 --> 04:26.433
but I think maybe this
is what your family gets

04:26.558 --> 04:28.185
for being Jewish
at Christmastime.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.103
Dude, Cartman.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.981
I'm just saying maybe Jesus
is having a little revenge.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.275
I found the number of a really
cheap airline to Canada.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.693
If we go as soon as possible --

04:35.818 --> 04:37.820
Dude, we just can't up
and go to Canada.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.488
They're about to light
the Christmas tree.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.074
Maybe you can get your brother
back some other way.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.288
Kyle, I just want you to know,

04:47.413 --> 04:48.956
if it were any other time
of the year,

04:49.081 --> 04:51.083
I still wouldn't help you.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.338
Three! Two! One!

04:59.216 --> 05:00.926
As we celebrate
this glorious time,

05:01.051 --> 05:03.012
we can't forget those families
who are suffering.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.431
As many of you know,
the Broflovski family

05:05.556 --> 05:07.725
has recently had their child
torn away from them.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.186
As a community, we must do
all we can to ease their pain.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.397
Are there any suggestions
how we might help?

05:14.982 --> 05:18.569
How about we get rid
of all the Mexicans?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.280
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas

05:21.405 --> 05:23.032
you suggest we get rid
of all the Mexicans,

05:23.157 --> 05:25.075
and every Christmas
we tell you no.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.368
Rats!

05:26.493 --> 05:28.996
The Broflovskis need money
to appeal their case

05:29.121 --> 05:30.497
to the new Canadian
prime minister.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.000
What if this Christmas,
instead of buying presents,

05:33.125 --> 05:36.128
we all use that money
to give to the Broflovskis?

05:36.253 --> 05:37.713
Ha!
Yeah, right!

05:37.838 --> 05:40.090
Like our parents aren't gonna
buy us presents for Christmas.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.468
That's a great idea, Chef.
- What?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.678
Yeah.
Who needs more stuff, anyway?

05:44.803 --> 05:47.598
This Christmas we can do
something that really matters!

05:47.723 --> 05:49.016
Dad, don't get carried away.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.017
Then it's settled.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.685
This year, we'll give
all our Christmas money

05:51.810 --> 05:54.188
to the Broflovskis
in hopes that they may someday

05:54.313 --> 05:55.856
have their child returned
to them.

05:57.524 --> 06:00.027
No. No.
This can't be happening!

06:06.241 --> 06:07.785
You fucking asshole!

06:07.910 --> 06:09.953
This is all your fault!
- What?

06:10.079 --> 06:12.623
Everyone's gonna be charitable
and give money to your family

06:12.748 --> 06:14.375
instead of buying
Christmas presents!

06:14.500 --> 06:16.877
You fucking Jews
ruined Christmas again!

06:17.002 --> 06:18.545
Aah!
- Whoa. Whoa. Cartman.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.714
It wasn't enough for you people
to kill Jesus!

06:20.839 --> 06:22.925
Now you have to kill Christmas,
too, huh?!

06:23.050 --> 06:24.927
Cartman, calm down!
- Is that true?

06:25.052 --> 06:27.346
It's true, dude.
Christmas is ruined.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.098
This is it, Kyle.
You and me.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.974
We're throwing down right now.

06:31.100 --> 06:33.268
I'm sorry, you guys, but there
is something we can do.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.979
We can go to Canada and see
the prime minister like I said.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.773
If we can change <i>his</i> mind
before Christmas,

06:37.898 --> 06:39.858
then your parents won't have to
give my family money.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.527
You really think
if we go to Canada,

06:41.652 --> 06:42.778
we might still get presents?

06:42.903 --> 06:43.862
It's worth a shot.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.781
Come on, you guys.
We can do this.

06:45.906 --> 06:46.782
Oh, all right.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.826
But we'd better not miss out on
any great Christmas adventures.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.828
We'll get back in time
for a Christmas adventure.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.663
Fine, but if it doesn't work,

06:52.788 --> 06:54.248
you and me are gonna
have it out, Kyle.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.958
Once and for all.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.463
No business.

07:01.588 --> 07:06.301
Christmastime come and nobody
want to eat Chinese food.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.930
Looks like
I might as well close.

07:11.974 --> 07:15.477
Oh, boy! Some business!
Finally!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.938
Hello! Chitty Wok!
Take order, please!

07:18.063 --> 07:19.314
Oh.
I must have the wrong number.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.941
We were trying to reach
City Airlines.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.068
Oh. Oh, yes.
Just a moment, please.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.530
Hello.
Chitty Airlines.

07:26.655 --> 07:27.990
Can I help you take order,
please?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.701
Uh, we need to go to Canada
as soon as possible.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.579
Ooh, Canada. Okay.
That's pretty far.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.956
Gonna cost a lot of money.
Let's see.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.833
How many people?
- Four.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.919
Okay. Four people, Canada,
cost a lot of money.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.673
Gonna be about 6,500 dorrah.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.967
How about 50 dorrah?

07:47.759 --> 07:49.136
50 dorrah?!

07:49.261 --> 07:52.598
You flying to Canada!
Cost at least 3,000 dorrah!

07:52.723 --> 07:54.433
55 dorrah.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.478
Hey! Stop wasting my time
with 55 dorrah.

07:57.603 --> 08:01.523
No way I take my plane to Canada
for less than 1,000 dorrah!

08:01.648 --> 08:03.650
Okay.
60 dorrah.

08:03.775 --> 08:06.403
62 dorrah.
- Okay.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.155
Okay.
Meet me Park County Airfield.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.616
Yellow Cessna.
Tail number 432G.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.700
Got it!

08:13.160 --> 08:15.537
Never try to barter
with a Chinese man.

08:17.498 --> 08:20.209
We have exactly 52 hours
before Christmas.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.169
That means we have to be back
in 28 hours

08:22.294 --> 08:24.838
to still give our parents
24 hours to buy us presents.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.256
Synchronize watches on my mark.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.257
Mark.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.552
Hello!
Welcome Chitty Airline!

08:30.677 --> 08:33.347
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
I am not flying in that thing.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.348
Mrph.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.475
Why not?
- Mrph rmhmhm rm!

08:36.600 --> 08:38.644
You're not gonna die, Kenny!
Don't be stupid!

08:38.769 --> 08:39.645
You guys go get Ike.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.605
Kenny and I will stay here
and watch the fort.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.648
No.
You're both coming.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.233
Do you care about Christmas
or not?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.651
Of course I care
about Christmas!

08:45.776 --> 08:47.319
Oh, Christ on a stick!

08:49.696 --> 08:51.990
Oh, dude, it smells like
kung pao chicken in here.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.909
Okay.
Welcome aboard Chitty Airline.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.536
This is your captain speaking.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.162
Looking about two-hour flight.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.081
I'll be turning on
the seat belt sign now.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.541
If your seats <i>had</i> seat belts,

09:00.666 --> 09:02.334
this is the time
you would fasten them.

09:02.459 --> 09:06.046
Please sit back, relax,
and enjoy your Chitty flight.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.013
All right!
We're going to Canada!

09:15.138 --> 09:16.682
Weak.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.907
Hey.
Turn off the light.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.243
Whoa.
Wait! Oh. Oh!

09:36.368 --> 09:37.953
What's going on?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.914
Hello from the cockpit.
This is your captain speaking.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.333
As you can see, it appears
that we are going down.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.877
Now would be a good time
to reflect on your life

09:46.003 --> 09:48.046
and pray to whatever deity
you believe in.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.881
Thank you for flying
Chitty Airlines.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.383
We know you have
a choice in airlines,

09:51.508 --> 09:53.468
and it looks like
you made the wrong one.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.887
Hey!
Where the hell are you going?!

09:57.389 --> 10:00.309
Do something, Kyle!
- I'm trying!

10:00.434 --> 10:03.061
Look out!
- Mrphhhh!

10:13.363 --> 10:14.656
You guys.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.117
I don't think we're in America
anymore.

10:20.203 --> 10:23.707
Excuse me!
Uh, is this an invasion?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.459
No.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.461
Oh, thank heavens!
It's okay.

10:27.586 --> 10:28.920
Everyone, it's not an invasion!

10:31.089 --> 10:32.799
I was sure when that plane
fell from the sky

10:32.924 --> 10:33.967
that we had an invader!

10:34.092 --> 10:35.594
Hey, we're in Canada!

10:35.719 --> 10:37.220

Why are you here today?

10:54.988 --> 10:58.325

got taken back here to Canada.

The new prime minister doesn't
live in this part of Canada.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.041
He's in Ottawa.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.462
So, how do we get to Ottawa?
- Oh, that's easy.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.047
You just have to follow
the road.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.173

15:29.262 --> 15:30.931
He sure has screwed up things
for Newfoundland.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.683

to take his sodomy ban away.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.815
Yeah. Sure.
Except there's just one problem.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.733
What?

15:41.858 --> 15:43.652
You folks is going
the wrong way.

What?! But I thought there
was only one road in Canada!

15:46.446 --> 15:48.365
Yeah, and you all went
the wrong direction on it.

15:48.490 --> 15:51.034
Oh, that's right!
Ottawa is that way.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.120
Of course.
Ottawa left, Newfoundland right.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.455
Oh, no!

15:55.580 --> 15:57.290
How could you be so stupid?!

15:57.415 --> 15:58.959

we can go all the way back!

Ch ristmas,

It's almost Christmas!

16:57.142 --> 16:58.601
Yes?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.395
We need to see
the new prime minister.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.771
Ha!
Impossible!

17:01.896 --> 17:04.524

is not seeing anybody.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.443

So much for that.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.444
We gave it our best,

17:07.569 --> 17:09.612
but I guess our best
wasn't good enough, eh?

17:09.738 --> 17:10.697
No.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.198
No!

17:12.323 --> 17:13.616
Yes?

17:13.742 --> 17:15.869
Please, sir! I've traveled
a long way to get here.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.454

who can help me.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.289

17:19.414 --> 17:21.249
He's in China
on official business.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.252

Goodbye!

17:24.377 --> 17:26.212

my brother back.

17:28.923 --> 17:32.635

any Christmas presents.

Sir, you recently passed
a new law

their children up for adoption

18:10.548 --> 18:11.800

18:11.925 --> 18:14.010
- My little brother --
- Not so fast!

18:14.886 --> 18:16.721
Ike!
- Kyle!

18:16.846 --> 18:19.140
Prime Minister, these are
the child's Canadian parents.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.476
Their Canadian blood
pumps through his veins.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.687
Would you send him to America
with those war-hungry scum?

18:24.813 --> 18:25.897
Please, sir.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.274
I came because I don't think
Ike belongs here.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.401
Family isn't about whose blood
you have in you.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.237
Family is about the people
who cared about you

18:32.362 --> 18:33.571
and took care of you.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.366
We're not the same blood,
but I love my little brother.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.743
We've taken care of him
because he needed us to.

18:38.868 --> 18:42.413
And that makes us more family
than anything.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.959
That was a great speech, guy.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.086
But the answer is no!

18:48.211 --> 18:51.923
All of my new laws
will stay in effect forever!

18:52.048 --> 18:53.758
Ha ha!
You lose, Americans!

18:53.883 --> 18:56.761
Then I suppose us Mounties
will never get our horses.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.638
And we won't get our wine.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.515
And we can't perform sodomy, eh?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.767
But <i>why</i> are you making
such strange laws?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.811
I said go!

19:07.063 --> 19:09.649
Oh, my God!
They killed Kenny!

19:09.774 --> 19:11.693
You...bastards.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.611
What -- What the hell
is wrong with you?

19:13.736 --> 19:16.281
What kind of prime minister
bases his decisions on hatred

19:16.406 --> 19:19.367
and takes away Mounties' horses
and French people's wine?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.578
What the hell kind of
prime minister are you, anyway?

19:21.703 --> 19:24.455
I am the prime minister
of Canada!

19:24.581 --> 19:27.000
I can do whatever I...

19:27.917 --> 19:28.751
Uh-oh.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.045
Uh, don't mind that guy hiding
in the spider hole.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.046
He's just my friend.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.423
What the hell?

19:33.548 --> 19:35.300
Hey, that looks like
Saddam Hussein!

19:35.425 --> 19:38.011
Saddam Hussein?
No! Relax, buddy.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.304
I'm not him.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.638
That explains everything.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.473
The new prime minister
was Saddam Hussein,

19:42.599 --> 19:44.601
once again trying to take over
our beloved Canada

19:44.726 --> 19:45.768
like he did before.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.020
Saddam Hussein?

19:47.145 --> 19:48.354
He was fooling us?

19:48.479 --> 19:49.397
Get him!

19:49.522 --> 19:52.192
Uh, don't shoot!
I want to negotiate!

19:52.317 --> 19:53.359
Hey!
Relax!

19:53.484 --> 19:54.485
Aah!

19:54.611 --> 19:55.486
Wait a minute!

19:55.612 --> 19:57.280
This means all
the prime minister's new laws

19:57.405 --> 19:58.656
are null and void.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.200
We can have our horses back!

20:00.325 --> 20:01.826
And we can drink our wine!

20:01.951 --> 20:03.870
And I can sodomize me boys
again.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.247
Young man,
you must really care for Peter

20:06.372 --> 20:07.957
to have come all this way.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.210
Perhaps we were wrong
to try and take Peter back.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.213
He doesn't belong here.
He belongs with his family.

20:13.338 --> 20:17.383
Peter, would you like to go
back to your home in Colorado?

20:24.349 --> 20:25.350
What is that?

20:25.475 --> 20:28.353
It's Christmas.
We officially missed it.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.606
It's Christmas Day,
and...I'm in Canada.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.566
Well, yeah.
But I got my brother back.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.861
Yeah, you got your brother back,
but I didn't get any presents!

20:36.986 --> 20:38.529
And what did I tell you, Kyle?!

20:38.655 --> 20:40.531
I told you if we didn't make it
back in time for Christmas,

20:40.657 --> 20:41.866
I was gonna whoop your ass,
didn't I?!

20:41.991 --> 20:42.700
Dude, come on.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.327
Now you're gonna get it,
motherfucker.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.330
That's right. You and me,
right now, we're having it out!

20:47.455 --> 20:49.749
Let's go! Come on!
Come on!

20:59.842 --> 21:02.220
Mo-o-m!

21:02.345 --> 21:04.681
Mo-o-o-o-m!

21:04.806 --> 21:05.765
Hey, come on, boys!

21:05.890 --> 21:09.394
You can spend Christmas
with us -- Canada style!
