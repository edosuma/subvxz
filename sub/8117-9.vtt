WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:05.106
I'm heading OTG.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.874
Something I gotta
take care of.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.209
When will you be back?

00:08.242 --> 00:10.678
24 hours at most.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.247
Good.

00:13.281 --> 00:16.717
I've been thinking about
the anniversary as well.

00:16.750 --> 00:20.054
It sure doesn't seem
like three years, does it?

00:20.088 --> 00:21.255
Yeah, it doesn't.

00:21.289 --> 00:24.958
You know, Skye,
your parents would be real proud

00:24.992 --> 00:26.136
of the young woman
you've become.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.296
You say that every year.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.631
Well, it's true every year.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.868
We lost a lot of
good people that winter,

00:34.902 --> 00:36.737
your folks included.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.673
I think syncillic fever
has killed more people

00:39.707 --> 00:42.310
than anything else this
place has thrown at us.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.079
Do you think they'll
ever find a cure?

00:45.113 --> 00:47.014
I sure hope so.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.982
So, when I get back,

00:49.016 --> 00:51.219
if you like, you and I can

00:51.252 --> 00:53.187
take a walk out to
Memorial Field together.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.922
I'd love that.
Good.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.191
Thank you.
It's all right.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.160
Commander.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.429
What is it, Dunham?

01:01.462 --> 01:04.031
What's your reason for
leaving the colony today?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.132
Beg pardon?

01:05.166 --> 01:07.801
All citizens need a valid,

01:07.835 --> 01:10.003
colony business-related
reason for departing.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.373
Your new lockdown protocols.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.708
No exceptions.
You said it yourself.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.677
That I did.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.112
Good job, soldier.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.114
Thank you, sir.
You're dismissed.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.015
Just go.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.184
Yes, sir.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.785
Open the gates
for the commander.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.259
I never wanted to
see those towers

01:31.292 --> 01:33.127
pointing any direction but out.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.062
This is temporary.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.397
We'll find the spy.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.798
Stay on it, will
you, Shannon?

01:37.831 --> 01:42.370
You're the only one around
here I trust 100% right now.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.172
Especially in my absence.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.440
Washington is out there

01:46.474 --> 01:48.276
with the survey team
at Outpost Number Nine

01:48.309 --> 01:50.110
for at least
the next three days.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.979
You're in charge
until I get back.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.248
Good luck, Commander.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.213
Don't!

03:33.247 --> 03:35.449
Don't even think
about it, Taylor.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.652
Mira.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.020
What brings you out this way?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.722
Same as you.

03:41.755 --> 03:45.459
Came to see if your boy's
gotten any closer to an answer.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.265
Looks like he has.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.302
Well, isn't it
a lousy day to be you?

03:54.335 --> 03:55.936
Hands behind your back.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.471
Get on the ground.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.423
He's hungry today.

04:15.456 --> 04:19.493
And I have a math test first
period, so let's get going.

04:19.527 --> 04:22.129
I think I'll call him... Boxer.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.531
What do you think?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.442
I think that yesterday you
decided to call him Hank,

04:25.466 --> 04:26.776
the day before that
it was Orville,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.503
and that's pretty much how
it's been going now,

04:29.537 --> 04:30.771
for almost a month.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.040
Well, I want to make
sure I get it right.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.275
Jim, no! Impossible.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.710
Malcolm,
you don't have a choice.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.046
Every time you data swap
with one of your survey RB's,

04:39.079 --> 04:41.281
you gotta do it on a secure
channel in the compound.

04:41.315 --> 04:44.385
Look. If I can't communicate in
real time from my laboratory,

04:44.418 --> 04:45.819
I might as well
halt the research.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.988
Security trumps
research for now.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.357
We've cut the Sixer spy off.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.191
They're gonna need to
find a new way to talk,

04:51.224 --> 04:53.403
and there's a chance they'll try
to piggyback on your frequency.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.695
This is nonsense.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.164
Well, I'm sorry you
feel that way.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.499
Actually, I'm not.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.934
This is the new protocol.
Okay? We clear?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.437
Yep.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.339
You asked to see me, sir?

05:05.373 --> 05:07.307
You don't have to
call me "sir."

05:07.341 --> 05:08.809
Today I do.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.512
Relieve Rogers and Blanchard
at the northeast gate.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.781
You seem more
nervous than usual.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.450
Is that because today I'm
not just Maddy's father,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.718
I'm also your C.O.?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.153
Permission to neither
confirm nor deny, sir?

05:20.187 --> 05:22.189
Permission granted.

05:22.222 --> 05:25.893
I know it might seem
a little strange,

05:25.926 --> 05:28.629
Taylor having a non-military
person in charge.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.263
Thanks.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.366
How are the other
soldiers taking it?

05:32.400 --> 05:33.634
Like an order, sir.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.035
Good.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.571
The reason I called you up:
You're the duty officer on tour?

05:37.605 --> 05:40.741
If any of the work detail
wants to leave the colony

05:40.774 --> 05:42.443
the foreman must see
me first. Understood?

05:42.476 --> 05:43.811
Sir, got something!

05:50.918 --> 05:52.219
What is it?

05:52.252 --> 05:53.597
Flashes of light
from the tree line.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.698
Definitely a telegraphic code.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.924
That's got to be a Sixer.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.460
We need eyes on
the return signal.

06:01.995 --> 06:05.198
The spy is talking back
from inside the colony.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.400
But where?

06:06.434 --> 06:08.802
Come on.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.243
Hold on.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.277
You got something?

06:17.310 --> 06:19.747
Maybe. Flashes in
the new construction.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.515
Row J.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.051
That's not just a reflection.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.919
It's some kind of code.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.254
That's our guy.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.222
Nice catch, Reynolds.
You're with me.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.326
Come on, come on.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.394
Come on, move!

06:34.428 --> 06:36.263
Want to call for some backup?

06:36.296 --> 06:37.898
Nah, you and I are
gonna take this.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.900
I want to keep
this circle tight.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.569
I don't know
who we can trust.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.612
Those lights still active?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.004
Affirmative, sir.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.040
All right. 30 seconds out. They
gotta keep talking till then.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.948
Reynolds.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.652
Come over here.
Look at this.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.956
In the paint sealant.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.925
Looks like blood.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.535
Base camp, this is Mira.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.503
Come in. Carter, come in.

07:49.537 --> 07:52.940
You're never going to get a signal
down here, don't you know that?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.093
You gotta be up on the ridge.
Shut up and keep moving.

07:57.044 --> 08:01.414
This mean I'm finally going
to get a look at Mira's lair?

08:01.448 --> 08:03.283
Yeah, well, it's not much,
but it's home.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.152
For now, anyways.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.656
Getting back to 2149...
That's the plan, isn't it?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.759
Going back rich...
That's the plan.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.360
Once Lucas finishes his work.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.262
Putting a lot of faith

08:15.295 --> 08:16.897
in some guy who spends his days

08:16.930 --> 08:18.365
scrawling equations
on the rocks.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.838
Oh, he puts them there
for you to see

08:19.867 --> 08:20.910
so you know he's getting closer

08:20.934 --> 08:22.670
to making the portal
go both ways.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.471
And there's nothing you can do
to stop him.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.874
- Don't bet on that.
- Pretty smug

08:26.907 --> 08:29.643
for a guy who's tied up and
being taken to the enemy camp.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.712
So what's the play,
bringing me in this way?

08:31.745 --> 08:35.582
If you think my people are gonna
cut some kind of a deal for my release,

08:35.616 --> 08:37.784
you're out of your mind.
Yeah, well, either way,

08:37.818 --> 08:40.854
with you gone, Terra Nova is
that much more vulnerable.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.241
Get up!

09:01.274 --> 09:04.444
I'm the one with the gun.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.614
That wasn't a very smart move.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.048
Now let's go.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.183
Come on.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.029
Hey.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.163
Hey, Skye.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.665
Hey. Um, I'm sorry.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.033
I'm running late.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.335
Listen, this'll
only take a second.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.644
I want to apologize
for everything.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.811
For stealing
the medication,

09:37.845 --> 09:39.913
for dragging you into
this whole thing with Mira

09:39.947 --> 09:42.449
and the Sixers. I just didn't
think it would turn into

09:42.482 --> 09:44.251
such a ginormous mess.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.518
I told you it would.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.721
I mean, I should
have listened.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.957
Look, Josh...

09:51.358 --> 09:53.060
The Sixers don't
mess around.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.594
Terra Nova wouldn't be
on lockdown

09:54.628 --> 09:56.229
if they were just
our friendly neighbors.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.164
Yeah, I know.
Look,

09:57.197 --> 09:59.432
Josh, I'm really late.

09:59.466 --> 10:03.103
So this means you
accept my apology?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.604
Warily.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.173
I'll take warily.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.676
I'll see you later.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.856
Yeah, all the information
we need is on here.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.523
It just needs transferring,
basically. Is that all right?

10:14.547 --> 10:17.084
Thanks so much.
Thank you.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.385
Um, Elisabeth?

10:18.418 --> 10:20.187
Morning, Malcolm.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.354
Can I ask...? Hi.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.956
Um, can I talk to you

10:22.990 --> 10:24.391
about something?
Sure.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.194
The baby Ankylosaurus.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.697
Yeah, I think he's
healthy enough now

10:29.730 --> 10:31.799
to be released into
the wild. I don't know.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.176
His musculature
could be more developed.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.101
Maybe in a few weeks.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.679
If he stays in the
laboratory much longer,

10:35.703 --> 10:37.183
he's gonna lose the
ability to coexist

10:37.637 --> 10:39.740
with his own kind
altogether. You know that.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.974
Not necessarily.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.786
There are many differing
opinions on adaptation studies

10:42.810 --> 10:44.077
and development...

10:44.111 --> 10:46.814
Elisabeth, you've let
him stay here too long.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.850
I think we
both know why.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.687
Zoe's going to be heartbroken,
but I will talk to her.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.822
You win.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.224
The Ankylosaurus goes home
to the wild soon.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.726
Uh... today.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.394
Tomorrow.

11:02.362 --> 11:03.630
You're impossible.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.198
Thank you, Malcolm.

11:08.535 --> 11:09.569
Hey, Skye.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.071
Hey.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.140
You're not on shift until
tonight, right?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.844
Uh, no. I just, uh, forgot
my I.D. in my locker.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.312
Okay, see you soon.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.871
I combed the entire area.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.073
No trace anywhere.
They got away.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.476
Don't move.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.611
Our mole must have got cut
trying to get away.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.014
I'm just gonna try
to grab the sample

11:54.047 --> 11:55.348
before it dissolves
completely.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.225
Damn it.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.297
Elisabeth.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.299
Oh, hey, what are you
doing here?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.068
Um, I just broke the news

12:15.102 --> 12:18.071
that the baby Ankylosaurus
has to go home.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.740
Well, remember, sweetie,
we talked about this.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.542
He has to go
home sometime.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.444
What's up?

12:24.477 --> 12:27.114
Uh, I could use your help.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.716
What's this?
Evidence.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.886
Okay. Uh, hey...

12:32.920 --> 12:34.321
honey, why don't you go

12:34.354 --> 12:36.256
and spend some time
with Hank, yeah?

12:36.289 --> 12:39.192
His name's Boxer.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.363
Okay, what kind
of evidence?

12:43.396 --> 12:46.333
Blood. We got close
to the Sixer spy.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.101
They slipped away,
but they may have left

12:48.135 --> 12:49.636
some DNA behind in this.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.171
Well, how much blood
was there?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.705
One drop.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.309
You're not joking, are you?

12:58.511 --> 13:01.514
Even if there's the slightest
trace of blood,

13:01.548 --> 13:04.051
isolating it is
gonna be,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.285
well, nearly impossible.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.821
Jim, I'm a doctor,
not a chemist.

13:07.855 --> 13:11.524
You're gonna have to
talk to Malcolm. Sorry.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.367
I've always wondered
how'd you manage

13:20.400 --> 13:22.669
to get so many people
on the Sixth Pilgrimage

13:22.702 --> 13:25.138
without Hope Plaza catching on?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.874
My employers
have deep pockets.

13:26.907 --> 13:31.011
They gamed the lottery.
I thought so.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.847
What's the plan?
Take me down,

13:33.881 --> 13:36.016
help Lucas reverse
the portal, and then

13:36.049 --> 13:38.285
strip-mine this place
for everything it's worth?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.620
The job was supposed
to take six months, tops.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.788
You hadn't
caught onto us,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.190
I would have been
back in 2149

13:43.223 --> 13:45.358
with my daughter
a long time ago.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.028
That is so sweet.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.964
You and your little girl
living the good life

13:50.998 --> 13:53.000
in one of the domes.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.006
Who are you
to judge me?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.573
We were living on the street.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.210
Sienna got patch lung 'cause
I couldn't afford a doctor.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.046
Was I gonna get
recruited to come here?

14:06.079 --> 14:08.949
An ex-con and her
sick daughter?

14:08.982 --> 14:09.983
I had an opportunity

14:10.017 --> 14:12.219
to make a better life
for her and I took it.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.622
And I'm not gonna
apologize for it.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.391
Not to you or anyone.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.393
Now move.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.729
Your turn to wear
the cuffs.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.401
So...

15:01.434 --> 15:04.837
we're gonna take a
walk back to your rover,

15:04.871 --> 15:07.007
and then I'm taking you
to my brig.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.513
Move out, slow.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.070
I told Skye
to meet me here,

15:37.104 --> 15:38.781
but she didn't confirm she could
make it out.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.273
We got cut off mid-signal.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.142
Yeah, Terra Nova's on lockdown.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.144
She's smart.
She'll find a way.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.980
When she shows up,
bring her back to base camp.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.248
I'll hang tight.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.449
Yeah.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.235
Hey.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.574
Hey, Skye.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.742
Where you digging?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.210
OTG. We're preparing

16:17.244 --> 16:19.812
a new line for the Eleventh at
the water supply junction.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.114
Need anymore volunteers?

16:21.148 --> 16:22.882
Uh, don't you have

16:22.915 --> 16:24.127
your medical
internship with my mom?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.718
I'm on evening shift.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.654
Well, go get your work gear.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.822
We leave in about five minutes,
I guess.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.991
All right.

16:44.637 --> 16:48.541
When did you last see him?

16:48.575 --> 16:49.942
Lucas?

16:49.976 --> 16:52.912
A couple of weeks.

16:52.945 --> 16:55.548
He comes and goes when he wants.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.284
How did he look?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.386
You're asking me
if he's getting enough sleep

16:59.419 --> 17:00.653
and eating his vegetables?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.090
You know this whole
father-son drama?

17:03.123 --> 17:04.590
I don't pity you.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.459
Whatever's about
to come down on your head,

17:06.492 --> 17:07.827
you brought it on
yourself.

17:07.859 --> 17:08.694
What the hell does that mean?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.563
I asked Lucas why
he hates you so much,

17:10.597 --> 17:13.200
and he said to ask you
about Somalia.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.772
So?

17:23.210 --> 17:26.113
What happened in Somalia?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.386
Now the beast comes
out to play.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.422
He's my son.
I want him back.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.956
You think you can
get him back?

17:36.989 --> 17:38.725
He's gone, Taylor.
You don't even

17:38.758 --> 17:41.161
know what you're dealing
with. Lucas is crazy.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.662
You think I
control him?

17:42.695 --> 17:43.863
He controls me.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.167
Quiet.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.677
We're being watched.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.683
Keep moving.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.192
Absolutely not.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.460
Tell me why.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.428
Because it's the
chemical equivalent

18:15.462 --> 18:16.729
of a needle in a haystack.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.964
The dominant ingredient in

18:17.997 --> 18:19.899
paint sealant is toluene.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.835
And one of its
many talents?

18:22.869 --> 18:23.912
Destroying red blood cells.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.972
So, you're not gonna help me.

18:26.005 --> 18:26.673
Nope.
Fine.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.709
I'm busy with
something else.

18:31.644 --> 18:32.312
What are you doing?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.480
I'm hunting a spy.

18:33.513 --> 18:37.584
Now, I'm a little rusty since
high school chem, but, uh...

18:37.617 --> 18:38.385
Whoops.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.019
Are you insured for that?

18:40.052 --> 18:41.854
You are insane.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.224
I'm motivated.
Big difference.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.025
How does this work?
No, no.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.861
No! You're going
to blow up the lab.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.062
Are you trying
to kill us all?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.601
Malcolm.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.137
Unbelievable.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.880
Well?

19:07.914 --> 19:09.916
Yeah, there's a chance.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.084
A slight one.
But a chance.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.086
I'll let you get to it.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.356
Thanks for working
as fast as you can.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.168
Zoe?

19:33.806 --> 19:36.443
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

19:37.844 --> 19:42.282
I was just looking for Maddy
so... we can go for a walk.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.817
You're supposed to be in school.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.052
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.787
I'll go back to school now.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.391
Zoe?

19:54.093 --> 19:56.396
Hmm. Let me have
a look.

19:57.997 --> 20:02.569
Oh, Zoe...

20:02.602 --> 20:05.905
I gotta say,
I just don't get it.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.708
What? Why someone
would betray the colony.

20:08.741 --> 20:12.312
I know. Well, I used to be
pretty down about this place,

20:12.345 --> 20:15.448
but now it's kinda
grown on me.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.361
Seeing as how I tagged along,

20:18.385 --> 20:20.195
I should probably go check in
with the foreman.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.821
I'll save you a spot. Cool.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.949
I was starting to think
you weren't gonna make it.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.485
I'm here. Let's go.

21:08.335 --> 21:11.338
This week's intel.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.509
Now let me see her.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.055
She looks worse today.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.658
We haven't given her
the meds for a couple days.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.292
What? Why?

21:33.326 --> 21:35.227
You were late
with the intel drop.

21:35.261 --> 21:36.295
You son of a bitch.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.797
You want out of
the deal? Go ahead.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.132
Take her back to Terra Nova
and watch her die.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.035
Which she will,
without this.

21:43.069 --> 21:46.272
Remember, we're the
only ones with a cure.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.508
Next time
don't be late.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.139
Hi.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.542
It's me.

22:25.945 --> 22:29.549
Skye, you're here.

22:30.216 --> 22:34.521
How you doing, Mom?

22:47.900 --> 22:50.737
They're going to give you
more medicine, Mom.

22:50.770 --> 22:54.574
But I need to get back
before I'm missed.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.284
Elisabeth.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.986
Hey.
Hey.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.287
What is that?

23:08.320 --> 23:10.389
Clean sample.

23:10.423 --> 23:13.359
But that's all
we could extract.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.394
Malcolm did this?

23:15.428 --> 23:18.598
Yeah, but it
took some persuading.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.000
Okay.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.673
And we're off.
Okay.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.552
You know, given the level
of dissolution,

23:29.576 --> 23:31.310
this DNA extraction
isn't going to be ready

23:31.343 --> 23:32.645
until tomorrow morning.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.747
Tomorrow morning?
Yeah.

23:34.781 --> 23:38.417
Well, is there anything we can
do to speed up the process?

23:38.451 --> 23:40.520
No, I'm sorry. It needs time.

23:40.553 --> 23:43.222
But it will give you the
identity of the traitor.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.734
Okay. Look, I've got to go debrief
this morning's security patrols.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.461
If anything comes up,
find a soldier, raise me.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.429
Copy that, sir.

23:50.463 --> 23:53.365
Dr. Shannon, I'm
sorry I'm late.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.777
I was helping out
with Josh's detail.

23:54.801 --> 23:57.169
Oh, of course.
No problem.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.773
Um, so, uh, do you want me

24:00.807 --> 24:03.042
to finish the supplies
inventory from last night?

24:03.075 --> 24:05.144
Um, actually Nurse Ogawa is
prepping and sterilizing

24:05.177 --> 24:07.780
the CO-2 inhalers for
the arrival of the Eleventh.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.448
Maybe you can help with that.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.651
Yeah, of course.
Thanks, Skye.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.559
Enough?

24:29.702 --> 24:34.140
So, uh, how old is she?

24:34.173 --> 24:36.142
Turned seven in July.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.878
Seven... that's a good age.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.881
Guess I'll have to just
take your word for it.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.617
You got somebody
looking after her?

24:44.651 --> 24:47.854
That's part of the deal.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.790
Even if I can't be with her,
at least I know she's okay.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.826
That's no small thing,

24:53.860 --> 24:57.496
knowing you've done
right by your child.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.070
He looks good,
by the way.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.304
Lucas.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.305
Oh, yeah?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.339
Yeah.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.611
That's good to hear.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.784
I'm getting that feeling again.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.586
Yeah.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.721
Something's
out there.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.624
It's stalking us.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.398
It's over there.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.033
Run.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.066
Go.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.314
Move!

26:48.708 --> 26:52.011
It's all I could
come up with.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.713
I can't find
the damn guns.

26:53.746 --> 26:54.647
Can't see
a damn thing.

26:54.681 --> 26:55.882
Let it go, Taylor.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.750
You dove
five times.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.086
The pool's
too deep.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.756
This is not
slasher territory.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.324
What are they
doing here?

27:05.357 --> 27:09.328
You see those yellow oval
spots on the male's neck?

27:10.362 --> 27:12.131
Adolescent markings.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.066
Gone by the time
the slasher turns four.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.335
Yeah, what we got here
is a male and a female

27:16.368 --> 27:19.638
marking out their region
for the first time.

27:20.606 --> 27:21.741
They're moving in.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.142
That's why they're
so aggressive.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.879
In their minds we're
competing for this turf.

27:26.913 --> 27:30.549
That attack was as much
about claiming territory

27:30.582 --> 27:32.719
as it was about
killing us.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.753
They're going to be back.

27:33.786 --> 27:34.997
Oh, yeah, I figure
they're working

27:35.021 --> 27:39.191
their way down around
the falls right now.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.161
Guns are gone.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.369
This is all we got.

27:55.942 --> 27:59.511
We can fight
each other...

27:59.545 --> 28:01.447
or we can fight them.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.588
Sun's going down.

28:09.621 --> 28:10.823
We'll never
make it back

28:10.857 --> 28:13.092
to your transport
before nightfall.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.994
That's when they'll
attack again.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.028
Yeah.

28:16.062 --> 28:19.531
This is
good ground.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.301
It's defensible,
good sight lines.

28:23.002 --> 28:26.773
We stay here
and we fight.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.272
Not bad.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.849
It'll never burn.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.651
That's too thick.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.219
It's just right.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.220
Listen to me.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.890
I know how to fight
these bastards.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.225
I spent 118 days
out here on my own.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.527
Good for you... I'm
coming up on a thousand.

29:56.662 --> 30:00.132
You know, after we left Terra
Nova, we lost a lot

30:00.166 --> 30:02.835
of good people before we learned
how to survive...

30:02.869 --> 30:04.971
but we learned.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.584
You ready?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.819
Ready.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.292
I know you're busy, sir, but if
I could just have a minute...

30:26.325 --> 30:27.759
Make it quick, Reynolds.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.129
Uh, the, the events
in the last couple

30:30.162 --> 30:33.532
of days just got
me to thinking

30:33.565 --> 30:35.234
that, uh, you know,

30:35.267 --> 30:38.004
w-what's important in life an-
an-and what's not important

30:38.037 --> 30:41.473
and that life,
life is short,

30:41.507 --> 30:43.475
so short, and...

30:45.111 --> 30:48.047
I would like to declare my
intentions for your daughter.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.084
Excuse me?

30:52.118 --> 30:56.755
Uh... I-I mean, w-w-what
I'm saying is that I...

30:56.788 --> 30:58.958
someday

30:58.991 --> 31:02.962
I would, uh... like to
make her my wife.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.130
Maddy's 16.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.864
Yeah, yeah,
no, no, no,

31:05.898 --> 31:08.867
I-I know, and, and,
look, I-I will wait.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.669
No, it's always been
my intention to wait.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.838
Copy that.

31:14.106 --> 31:18.677
Reynolds, did you forget
that we're hunting a spy?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.046
Copy that.

31:20.079 --> 31:23.182
Any news on the
blood sample?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.617
I'm going
to check that now.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.920
Yeah, I-I'm going to go away.

31:27.954 --> 31:30.889
I'll, uh... bye.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.061
What happened?

31:35.094 --> 31:36.562
One of the night nurses
called me.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.764
It's the DNA sample.

31:38.797 --> 31:40.899
It's destroyed.

31:41.867 --> 31:43.769
The spy.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.371
It's someone
who had access

31:45.404 --> 31:47.239
to this building.
Yeah, well,

31:47.273 --> 31:49.184
they obviously caught on
that you were getting close

31:49.208 --> 31:51.010
and decided to cover
their tracks.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.812
I need you
to put together a list

31:53.845 --> 31:55.314
of all medical center employees,

31:55.347 --> 31:56.882
the patients, and,
uh, their families

31:56.915 --> 31:57.883
who came to
visit them.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.285
Okay, I'll do it.

31:59.318 --> 32:00.586
It won't be a short list.

32:00.619 --> 32:01.820
Maybe not,

32:01.853 --> 32:05.591
but it's a list
and the mole is on it,

32:05.624 --> 32:07.659
and that's a start.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.745
Huh, nice tattoo.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.914
You were a Secessionist.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.283
I worked security for them.

32:31.317 --> 32:35.021
So you were at the Dome
when the army stormed the place?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.658
That's why you went to prison.

32:39.691 --> 32:43.162
Couldn't get work after that.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.631
Guess that's what happens when
you choose the wrong side.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.799
And here you are,

32:47.833 --> 32:50.969
on the wrong side once again.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.638
We'll see.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.741
I'm gonna grab another
stave, make a backup.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.655
Take the shot.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.088
Grubs.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.257
Protein.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.676
Could have been different.

34:38.610 --> 34:39.610
What's that?

34:39.645 --> 34:41.679
You and I.

34:41.713 --> 34:45.384
I figure there's a
parallel universe out there

34:45.417 --> 34:49.788
somewhere where...
we are allies.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.725
I've had that thought.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.726
You're smart.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.830
Good fighter.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.835
We could have made
a hell of a team.

35:15.214 --> 35:16.815
84 suspects.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.451
Better than the whole colony.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.488
We just got to figure out a way
to narrow down this list.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.490
I can narrow it
down for you now.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.992
I combed through the shards
of data that were left.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.328
Now, the DNA extraction
didn't complete, but it went

35:29.361 --> 35:32.198
far enough to tell us that
you are looking for a female.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.833
Huh. A woman.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.369
84 names just became...

35:37.403 --> 35:38.870
47.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.851
Taylor?

35:52.884 --> 35:54.986
Nice hunting with you.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.956
I was about
to say the same thing.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.491
Look, your son is close

35:59.525 --> 36:02.394
to figuring out
how to reverse the portal.

36:02.428 --> 36:04.696
This really is
almost over.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.233
Maybe so.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.268
Question is...
How does it end?

36:09.301 --> 36:11.870
We'll find out soon enough.

36:25.317 --> 36:29.120
Okay, Zoe, let's
take Boxer home.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.155
Bye, Boxer.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.524
I'll miss you.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.626
Now, be a good boy,

36:34.660 --> 36:36.762
eat lots of leaves,
and sleep all the time,

36:36.795 --> 36:40.031
and have good dreams
and play with your friends.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.301
Okay?

36:42.334 --> 36:44.570
All right, Z, it's time.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.959
Bye.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.744
Uh, sir?

38:00.346 --> 38:03.482
Uh, it was a pleasure
riding with you today.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.019
That's what the
cops say, right?

38:08.053 --> 38:10.356
Close enough.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.395
Reynolds?

38:16.428 --> 38:19.164
Come here.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.333
Got to tell you something.

38:21.367 --> 38:23.369
Look, I know I make you nervous,

38:23.402 --> 38:25.371
and I can be a little tough

38:25.404 --> 38:27.906
sometimes, but Maddy's

38:27.939 --> 38:29.274
my oldest girl.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.876
I get protective.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.411
You know?

38:32.444 --> 38:33.845
And if you think I'm bad,

38:33.879 --> 38:35.723
you should have met Elisabeth's
father back in the day.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.016
I mean, compared to him,
I'm a... I'm a puppy dog.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.454
Anyway, uh...

38:42.488 --> 38:45.591
I think you're a good kid.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.427
And that's it.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.228
Thank you, sir.

38:50.261 --> 38:53.098
No, I'm not your C.O. anymore,
so, no need to call me sir.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.266
Thanks, Jim.
No, no.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.411
It's still
Mr. Shannon to you.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.838
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.283
You look like you were
wrestling with a Nyko.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.052
It was not a boring trip.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.288
So, Lucas make any progress
reversing the portal?

39:17.322 --> 39:18.657
I'm afraid he has.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.892
How about you?
You making progress?

39:20.926 --> 39:23.695
Oh, we got it down
to 47 suspects.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.363
And we know
it's a woman.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.400
47.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.301
You keep working on it.

39:30.335 --> 39:33.038
Get this finished for me.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.006
I will.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.544
How'd it feel?

39:38.577 --> 39:40.479
Wearing the commander's cap
while I was gone?

39:40.512 --> 39:42.881
Wouldn't want
to do it every day.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.720
Skye.
Mr. Shannon.

39:50.288 --> 39:52.357
Glad you're back.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.159
Good to be back.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.094
It's good to see you.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.463
Everything okay?

39:57.496 --> 39:59.397
You bet.

39:59.431 --> 40:03.869
So, we still gonna take a walk
together out to Memorial Field?

40:05.637 --> 40:07.405
Yeah, I hope so.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.874
Good.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.776
All right, let me get myself
cleaned up,

40:10.809 --> 40:13.278
and, uh, I'll meet you
at the main gate

40:13.311 --> 40:15.681
in, uh, 15 or 20.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.316
You know,

40:18.349 --> 40:21.019
I meant what I said to you.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.722
They'd be real proud

40:23.755 --> 40:25.857
to see the fine young woman
you've become.

40:30.395 --> 40:32.430
Skye, you got something

40:32.464 --> 40:35.400
on your mind?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.768
No.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.037
All right.
