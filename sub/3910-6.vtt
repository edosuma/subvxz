(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo
scripted original series.

00:04.033 --> 00:06.967
(Jill)
Previously on Odd Mom Out...

00:06.967 --> 00:09.567
I hate schlepping
to Brooklyn.

00:09.567 --> 00:11.967
I'm having
a total real estate boner.

00:11.967 --> 00:14.400
Andy, I think we belong
in Brooklyn.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.667
I'm Elliot, by the way.

00:15.667 --> 00:19.067
Vanessa.

00:19.067 --> 00:21.067
We've had three other bids
already.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.433
Four.

00:22.433 --> 00:26.367
- Mom!
- Dude, I'm ready to go here.

00:26.367 --> 00:28.267
Honey, you seem very tense.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.367
It's because
I just drank afterbirth.

00:30.367 --> 00:34.767
Thank you, God, for returning us
to this wonderful neighborhood.

00:34.767 --> 00:37.433
So baby number four,
good for you.

00:37.433 --> 00:39.833
Thanks,
I'm Shamu.

00:39.833 --> 00:44.233
There is a tumor with hair
coming out of my assáááá.

00:44.233 --> 00:45.567
What is happening?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.967
You're having this baby
the natural way.

00:47.967 --> 00:49.367
No!

00:51.500 --> 00:54.467
[bell jingling]

00:56.333 --> 00:58.333
Do you need shampoo,
conditioner, anything?

00:58.333 --> 01:00.700
Matt? Matt.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.333
Jill.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.700
Jill Kaplan.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.533
Junior year abroad.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.133
We dated.

01:07.133 --> 01:10.067
We backpacked in Greece
and Turkey.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.333
Right, right.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.967
Wow.

01:12.967 --> 01:15.067
Sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

01:15.067 --> 01:19.133
You look different.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.133
Is everything okay?

01:23.800 --> 01:26.067
* Hey, yes, you know *

01:26.067 --> 01:29.267
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:30.633 --> 01:33.500
Brooke? Brooke?

01:33.500 --> 01:35.367
Crystal?

01:35.367 --> 01:37.100
Where is everybody?

01:37.100 --> 01:38.833
Brooke, I came as fast
as I could.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.867
I had to drop Hazel
at a neighbor's.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.100
Brooke?

01:42.100 --> 01:43.900
[swing music]

01:43.900 --> 01:44.967
Brooke?

01:44.967 --> 01:48.267
* *

01:48.267 --> 01:51.067
- Brooke! Oh, thank God.
- Shh.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.933
I'm concentrating
on keeping the baby inside.

01:53.933 --> 01:55.800
I don't think
that's gonna work.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.267
Well, then what should I do?

01:57.267 --> 01:59.167
I think you
should have the baby.

01:59.167 --> 02:00.667
No, no, no. That baby

02:00.667 --> 02:02.567
is not coming out
through my Sally-Jane.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.600
This isn't the dark ages.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.800
[groaning]

02:05.800 --> 02:07.267
I think another one's coming,

02:07.267 --> 02:10.600
and I'm just not emotionally
prepared to have a preemie.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.733
Brooke, it's the day
before your scheduled C.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.067
That's not exactly the same
thing as having a preemie.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.333
- [groans loudly]
- Ow, ow, ow!

02:16.333 --> 02:18.667
Okay, we're gonna
get you to the hospital.

02:18.667 --> 02:20.200
Have you called your doctor?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.067
The bitch is in South Hampton,

02:22.067 --> 02:24.633
and don't get me started
on the ambulance saga.

02:24.633 --> 02:27.100
No one would promise
to take me to York Hospital,

02:27.100 --> 02:29.167
and I am a York Hospital girl.

02:29.167 --> 02:31.100
Okay, we're gonna
get you in a cab,

02:31.100 --> 02:33.067
and we're gonna get you
to York Hospital.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.067
- Thank you.
- We just have to

02:34.067 --> 02:36.067
- walk down the staircase--
- Aah!

02:36.067 --> 02:40.067
I'm not walking anywhere!
Aah!

02:40.067 --> 02:42.567
Holy head of hair.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.067
What happened
to your underwear?

02:44.067 --> 02:46.133
I took them off
after my water broke.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.233
Your water broke?

02:47.233 --> 02:49.300
Were you gonna mention that?

02:49.300 --> 02:51.400
Oh, my God,
this baby's coming out.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.900
And you can't tell anyone
about this.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.067
In fact, I keep non-disclosure
agreements in my top drawer.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.767
Aah!

02:59.767 --> 03:04.067
Okay, okay, breathe.
Breathe. Just breathe.

03:04.067 --> 03:07.067
What's that brown stuff?

03:07.067 --> 03:08.500
Did you track in mud?

03:08.500 --> 03:11.100
No, it's doodie.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.067
Gross, you took a dump
on my floor?

03:14.067 --> 03:16.900
No, Brooke,
it's your doodie.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.167
It's okay,
it's totally normal.

03:18.167 --> 03:19.467
It happens to everyone.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.367
Not to me, it doesn't.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.400
Why isn't Lex
calling me back?

03:24.400 --> 03:27.067
Where the hell is he!

03:27.067 --> 03:29.067
Mmm.

03:29.067 --> 03:33.367
This salted caramel really
tastes like salt and caramel.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.667
I don't know
how they do that.

03:34.667 --> 03:37.167
And it's, like,
half the calories?

03:37.167 --> 03:41.733
I got to admit, this idea you
had about unplugging for the day

03:41.733 --> 03:43.700
- was genius.
- I can't take credit for it.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.100
I read this thing in HuffPo
about how we should all be

03:46.100 --> 03:48.933
unplugging at least one day
a week.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.333
Aren't you nervous?

03:50.333 --> 03:53.233
I mean, I remember when Jill
was in her third trimester.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.600
She wouldn't let
me put my phone on vibrate,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.100
let alone turn it off.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.600
Nah. Brooke's got
her C-section tomorrow.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.267
She knows this is my last day
to just Zen-out, you know.

04:03.267 --> 04:06.433
[screaming gibberish]

04:09.400 --> 04:13.600
Siri, how do
I deliver a baby?

04:13.600 --> 04:15.167
(Siri)
Let's see what we can find.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.067
Here's what I found on the Web
for "how do I deliver a baby."

04:18.067 --> 04:19.367
I don't have time
to read this sháá.

04:19.367 --> 04:22.333
(Brooke)
Kill me, Jill.
Smother me with a pillow.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.400
[groaning]

04:24.400 --> 04:27.400
[eerie music]

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
* *

04:28.400 --> 04:30.100
Where did that frog
come from?

04:30.100 --> 04:32.633
Why is he staring at me
like that?

04:32.633 --> 04:34.133
This is just Grenouille.

04:34.133 --> 04:36.233
Every kid in Hazel's class
takes him home for the weekend,

04:36.233 --> 04:38.067
and you take pictures
of all their adventures.

04:38.067 --> 04:40.067
Of course, I'm the one
stuck hauling him around.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.767
Stop talking.
Ugh.

04:41.767 --> 04:44.833
Sorry.
Okay, think happy thoughts.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.567
Think about your kids.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.467
Bergdorfs, Barneys, Bloomies.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.167
Bergdorfs, Barneys, Bloomies.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.967
(both)
Bergdorfs, Barneys, Bloomies.

04:51.967 --> 04:54.400
- Bergdorfs, Barneys, Bloomies.
- Oh, my God.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.333
Why isn't Vanessa
calling me back? Oh!

04:57.333 --> 05:00.400
[rock music]

05:00.400 --> 05:01.533
* *

05:01.533 --> 05:03.367
On a scale of one to ten,
how athletic are you?

05:03.367 --> 05:05.067
Two, but I'm great at sex.

05:05.067 --> 05:11.833
* *

05:11.833 --> 05:12.800
[pot shattering]

05:12.800 --> 05:20.800
* *

05:23.567 --> 05:25.100
Is it done?

05:25.100 --> 05:26.233
Is it out?

05:26.233 --> 05:27.900
No, I think it went back in.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.700
- Ooh. Ooh.
- Okay, give me those legs.

05:30.700 --> 05:31.800
Don't you want to take
these off?

05:31.800 --> 05:35.067
No! Aaah!

05:35.067 --> 05:36.367
- Yes!
- [moaning]

05:36.367 --> 05:39.233
[chanting in Hebrew]

05:39.233 --> 05:41.367
- Oh, yeah.
- [moaning]

05:41.367 --> 05:42.500
I got it.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.600
I got it.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.333
You remember when we used
to smoke doobs in this park

05:47.333 --> 05:49.467
when I was in high school
and you were in law school?

05:49.467 --> 05:53.467
[chuckles]
Now here we are,
babysitting our kids.

05:53.467 --> 05:57.767
Lex, when they're your kids,
it's not babysitting.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.633
See, this is why
I need you around,

05:59.633 --> 06:00.800
to call me on my sháá.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.200
I'm serious,
you should come be

06:02.200 --> 06:04.800
my in-house compliance lawyer
at Hercules.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.267
Easiest job in the world.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.800
When have you ever complied
with the law, Lex?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.267
You were laundering money

06:10.267 --> 06:12.767
when you were making fake IDs
in junior high.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.700
No, no, no, no, no.
that was seed money

06:14.700 --> 06:16.300
for another business venture.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.633
There's a difference.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.067
Well, thanks,

06:19.067 --> 06:20.900
but I think it's good
for me to have my own thing.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.833
Come work at Hercules
for, like, five years.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.167
If you're not having a blast,

06:25.167 --> 06:27.133
you'll have enough money
to start your own firm

06:27.133 --> 06:29.300
or go lay
on the beach somewhere

06:29.300 --> 06:32.733
or open a gelato stand,
for all I care.

06:32.733 --> 06:36.600
For me, it's all about family,
you know?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.867
What else really matters?

06:39.867 --> 06:43.367
Stop. Dad!

06:43.367 --> 06:45.333
Okay, one more push.

06:45.333 --> 06:48.067
It's gonna feel
like you're sháááing out a TV,

06:48.067 --> 06:50.067
and then it's gonna be
all over.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.267
- Okay?
- I can't, I can't do it.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.867
Yes, you can!
You were an Olympian!

06:54.867 --> 06:56.767
I'm not an Olympian.

06:56.767 --> 07:00.267
I marched in the opening
ceremonies, but I never skied.

07:00.267 --> 07:01.767
I was just an alternate.

07:01.767 --> 07:04.133
And I'm not allergic to wheat.
I hate Candace.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.567
I had a perm
in high school--

07:05.567 --> 07:07.067
Wait, back up.
You hate Candace?

07:07.067 --> 07:08.667
I thought you were
like Oprah and Gayle?

07:08.667 --> 07:10.467
Oh!
I can't do this.

07:10.467 --> 07:11.633
Yes, you can.

07:11.633 --> 07:12.867
You are a ball-buster.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.367
You are a bitch!

07:14.367 --> 07:17.667
You hate me.

07:17.667 --> 07:19.100
No, no, I meant it
in a nice way,

07:19.100 --> 07:21.100
like the way sassy, gay
black guys say it.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.100
- Aah!
- Okay.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.133
Oh, my God.
Here she comes.

07:25.133 --> 07:26.433
[both screaming]

07:26.433 --> 07:29.433
[triumphant music]

07:29.433 --> 07:31.600
* *

07:31.600 --> 07:34.567
[baby crying]

07:38.067 --> 07:40.600
[rock music]

07:40.600 --> 07:43.100
Yes, she's gorge.
She's healthy.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.267
And you were amazing.

07:45.267 --> 07:47.900
You were like
the Incredible Hulk in heels.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.433
I just have
to quickly call Andy

07:49.433 --> 07:51.733
and tell him that Crystal's
gonna get Hazel, okay?

07:51.733 --> 07:53.533
No, don't leave me, Jill.

07:53.533 --> 07:56.067
No, just--I promise,
I'll be right there.

07:56.067 --> 07:59.100
Two secs.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.233
Andy Weber,
please leave a message.

08:01.233 --> 08:03.633
[phone beeps]
- Andy, me again.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.233
I'm getting into an ambulance.

08:05.233 --> 08:08.600
So, if you can please go home
and get me some clean clothes

08:08.600 --> 08:12.333
and meet me at York Hospital,
like, now!

08:12.333 --> 08:13.467
Where are you?

08:13.467 --> 08:18.067
You better be dead,
or I will kill you!

08:18.067 --> 08:19.933
I just delivered a baby.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.333
Me, all by myself.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.800
Cut the cord
with Hello Kitty scissors.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.600
Call me back.
Bye.

08:29.733 --> 08:31.500
So what's it
gonna be, brah?

08:31.500 --> 08:33.800
You coming
to Hercules or not?

08:33.800 --> 08:37.467
[clears throat]

08:37.467 --> 08:39.500
You know what?
Yes.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.200
Let's do it.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.967
Yes! Bro town is back, baby!
Yeah!

08:45.967 --> 08:49.367
I have to talk to Jill first,
so don't--

08:49.367 --> 08:52.333
[upbeat music]

08:52.333 --> 08:54.600
* *

08:54.600 --> 08:55.667
Oh, look.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.400
22 texts from Brooke.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.833
Delete, delete, delete.

08:58.833 --> 08:59.833
Lex, look at them.

08:59.833 --> 09:07.867
* *

09:10.433 --> 09:13.400
So do you own or rent?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.433
- Are you kidding?
[knock at door]

09:15.433 --> 09:17.733
(woman)
NYPD, open up.

09:17.733 --> 09:19.200
Let's go.

09:22.467 --> 09:25.500
Hi, is there a problem,
officers?

09:25.500 --> 09:29.167
You tell us. Someone reported
a domestic-violence situation.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.500
- Oh.
- [laughs]

09:30.500 --> 09:32.400
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.067
No, it's nothing
like that.

09:35.067 --> 09:36.933
I've never actually
had a noise issue before.

09:36.933 --> 09:38.667
This place is solid.

09:38.667 --> 09:42.467
I'm a real estate broker, so
if you guys are ever looking--

09:42.467 --> 09:45.067
Thanks, but we're gonna have
to question you both separately

09:45.067 --> 09:46.367
and then fill out a report.

09:46.367 --> 09:49.800
Oh, guys, as an ER doctor,
I applaud your vigilance,

09:49.800 --> 09:53.800
but I promise
I wasn't being attacked.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.400
I was just having
a really loud orgasm.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.833
Well, more than one.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.500
By my count, maybe four.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.767
Two. More like two.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.267
Let's say three
and aftershocks.

10:04.267 --> 10:05.900
Things got a little crazy.
You guys know how it is.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.300
Okay, stop.
Stop talking.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.367
This will come out
with bleach.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.433
I'm sure the school
won't even notice.

10:15.433 --> 10:17.800
It's just human fluids.
It's totally natural.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.133
Jill!
Honey, are you okay?

10:19.133 --> 10:20.667
I can't believe
you delivered Brooke's baby.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.067
Andy, shh, shh.

10:22.067 --> 10:25.200
Now, listen closely, because
this is the official story.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.000
I was coming back from Brooklyn
when Brooke called me

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
and told me that she was moving
her C-section a day early

10:31.000 --> 10:33.067
for astrological reasons,
got it?

10:33.067 --> 10:34.767
Yeah, got it. You look
like you murdered someone.

10:34.767 --> 10:37.733
Okay, and Baby Langley
was seven pounds, three ounces,

10:37.733 --> 10:42.300
not ten pounds, two ounces
and did not, I repeat not,

10:42.300 --> 10:44.167
come through her Sally-Jane

10:44.167 --> 10:46.767
which I was never
inside of, got it?

10:46.767 --> 10:48.633
Now repeat it back to me.

10:48.633 --> 10:50.133
You were coming back
from Brooklyn and--

10:50.133 --> 10:51.767
Okay, fine.
Just give me the clothes.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.100
- You have a thing--Okay.
- I don't care.

10:53.100 --> 10:58.300
I have to take off this
vomitocious dress and burn it.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.533
Ta-da.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.100
Is this a joke?

11:01.100 --> 11:02.133
What's wrong?

11:02.133 --> 11:04.667
This is a red bandage dress.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.367
We're in a hospital,
I'm not on a singles' cruise.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.067
I'm sorry, honey.
It's the first thing I saw.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.733
Plus, I love you
in this dress.

11:10.733 --> 11:12.167
I haven't seen you in it
since the honeymoon.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.567
Yeah, and if you'll recall,

11:13.567 --> 11:15.500
that's why the zipper's broken,
but thank you.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.500
[rock music]

11:18.500 --> 11:20.333
* *

11:20.333 --> 11:24.133
Brookey, honey bear,
you got to forgive me, huh?

11:24.133 --> 11:26.600
I was out buying you
a little push present.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.467
You like it? Yeah?

11:28.467 --> 11:29.600
I'm thinking.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.967
Oh, my dear children,
I heard the news.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.733
I had my hair and nails done
and came right over.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.167
- It looks good, Mom.
- You know,

11:37.167 --> 11:40.367
I said to Fabian, "Do I look
like a grandmother of seven?"

11:40.367 --> 11:43.500
And he said, "You won't
when I'm done with you!"

11:43.500 --> 11:45.867
So sassy, don't you think?

11:45.867 --> 11:47.300
So sassy.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.333
Well, then I would like
to know the name

11:49.333 --> 11:50.967
of my new granddaughter,

11:50.967 --> 11:53.267
unless it's still
under lock and key.

11:53.267 --> 11:56.933
It's Langley Emmeline
Lockheart von Weber.

11:59.533 --> 12:01.067
Langley?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.433
As in the CIA headquarters?

12:03.433 --> 12:06.600
What--what happened to Maureen,
for my sister?

12:06.600 --> 12:11.567
Uh, Shipley, MacCallister,
Rutherford, and Maureen?

12:11.567 --> 12:14.633
Candace,
you have a whole new look.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.533
Yes, so do you.

12:16.533 --> 12:19.067
Did you hear
the new baby's name?

12:19.067 --> 12:20.733
I remember when I was pregnant
with Anderson

12:20.733 --> 12:23.333
and his name was gonna be
Horace, if it was a boy.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.300
Guys, we just saw the baby.
She's beautiful.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.067
She's beautiful.
Congratulations.

12:27.067 --> 12:30.200
But when my mother-in-law
implored me to reconsider,

12:30.200 --> 12:32.800
I realized that her happiness
was all that mattered.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.333
How are you feeling,
any better?

12:34.333 --> 12:35.767
Much.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.433
Anyway, darling,
in happier news,

12:37.433 --> 12:41.267
I heard you're going to work
for Alexander at Hercules.

12:41.267 --> 12:45.800
No, no, no, not for, with.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.567
Um, honey, may I please
rip you a new one, privately?

12:49.567 --> 12:51.700
Yeah.

12:53.233 --> 12:54.400
I'm sorry.
I know it was impulsive.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.867
I was under the influence
of salted caramel.

12:56.867 --> 12:59.500
You can't even pick a tie-shoe
combo without my help,

12:59.500 --> 13:01.533
but this you decide
on your own?

13:01.533 --> 13:04.233
I thought we both agreed
this would be a terrible idea.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.700
Lex is offering three times
my current salary, honey,

13:06.700 --> 13:07.867
plus bonuses.

13:07.867 --> 13:10.100
Minus your soul,
divided by your integrity.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.500
No, I get to keep my soul.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.733
I asked about that.

13:12.733 --> 13:15.067
Look, honey, look,
I get to set my own hours.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.333
I don't have to work weekends.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.567
We would have the time and money
to travel,

13:18.567 --> 13:20.067
take that trip to Paris--

13:20.067 --> 13:21.500
[gasps]
Grenouille!

13:21.500 --> 13:23.400
I still have to finish
Hazel's school project.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.600
Thank you.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.700
Jilly-beans.

13:25.700 --> 13:27.267
Brooke needs you

13:27.267 --> 13:28.300
Yeah, I'm outie.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.767
Moi aussi.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.900
Congratulations.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.333
- Thank you, Mother.
- Ta ta.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.667
- Bye, Mom.
- Okay.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.100
You go get the kids
and I'll meet you at home

13:37.100 --> 13:38.567
and we'll talk
about Hercules.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.700
- Okay.
- Is this okay?

13:40.700 --> 13:41.933
Yeah, pretty.

13:41.933 --> 13:44.933
[rock music]

13:44.933 --> 13:46.467
* *

13:46.467 --> 13:48.100
How's it going?

13:48.100 --> 13:50.833
Of course, Candace had to get
a whole makeover

13:50.833 --> 13:52.733
the day I give birth.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.667
And naturally,
she hates the baby's name.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.067
I thought Candace
only hated my kids' names.

13:58.067 --> 14:02.233
Jill, from now on,
we have to stick together.

14:02.233 --> 14:06.433
So, um, is there always
this much blood down there?

14:06.433 --> 14:08.867
It's like, did I deliver a baby
or a cheese grater?

14:08.867 --> 14:10.800
Yeah, that's standard issue.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.700
I was literally wearing
adult diapers for weeks.

14:13.700 --> 14:14.867
- Ew.
- I know.

14:14.867 --> 14:17.067
But you can't beat
the absorbency.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.667
Anyway, I should go.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.167
I want them, now.

14:21.167 --> 14:22.900
The adult diapers?

14:22.900 --> 14:24.133
Me?

14:24.133 --> 14:26.167
I'm about to faint
from hunger.

14:26.167 --> 14:28.833
You're the only person
I could bear asking.

14:28.833 --> 14:32.633
Oh, and could you also please
pick up a sandwich platter

14:32.633 --> 14:33.800
at William Poll?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.667
People are going
to be stopping by.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.733
Crystal was supposed to do it,
but now she's with the kids.

14:41.867 --> 14:46.700
Oh, I guess I'm just
gonna need my wallet.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.133
You're the best.

14:49.133 --> 14:50.467
Live for you.

14:50.467 --> 14:53.467
[bell jingling]

14:53.467 --> 14:56.967
Matt? Matt!
Jill Kaplan!

14:56.967 --> 14:58.533
Junior year abroad.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.233
We dated.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.400
Right, right.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.800
Wow.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.467
Sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

15:05.467 --> 15:08.933
You look different.

15:08.933 --> 15:09.967
Is everything okay?

15:09.967 --> 15:11.167
Yes, of course.

15:11.167 --> 15:13.433
Why? Oh, no.

15:13.433 --> 15:15.067
I'm not incontinent.

15:15.067 --> 15:17.567
These are just--long story...
[chuckles]

15:17.567 --> 15:20.400
but I turned out great.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.467
I have three beautiful kids
and a drop-dead husband

15:24.467 --> 15:27.500
who's about to triple
his salary.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.233
- So you want to see pictures?
- Another time.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.533
Really good to see you,
though, Jill.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.233
Take care.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.133
You going
to the reunion or--

15:36.133 --> 15:37.733
Good luck.

15:37.733 --> 15:39.733
Okay, bye!

15:41.600 --> 15:42.833
(Jill)
I'm back.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.100
Oh, thank God, I'm famished.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.167
- Take a break, you guys.
- Thanks, Brooke.

15:47.167 --> 15:51.100
So, Jill, Mario Testino
is stuck in Ibiza.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.467
He was really thrown
by the whole day-early thing.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.900
So, if you don't mind
taking some photos

15:56.900 --> 15:59.067
for my Instagram
and baby announcement...

15:59.067 --> 16:01.533
- Sure.

meet Baby von Weber.

16:15.833 --> 16:19.733
But she doesn't look
like a von.

16:19.733 --> 16:20.867
She looks ethnic.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.400
She's gorgeous,
just like her mama.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
Smile.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.700
You can Photoshop one
of Shipley's newborn pictures

16:27.700 --> 16:29.633
in later, right?

16:29.633 --> 16:32.533
She just--
she was more classic looking.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.200
[baby crying]

16:34.200 --> 16:38.333
Oh, I want to get one
with Grenouille, just for kicks.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.167
Wait.
Where is he?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.400
[rock music]

16:42.400 --> 16:43.633
Where is he?

16:43.633 --> 16:45.067
I just saw him
a second ago.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.167
Grenouille. Grenouille.

a minute ago.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.067
Oh, my God.
Grenouille.

16:57.067 --> 16:59.200
Grenouille.
Has anyone seen Grenouille?

16:59.200 --> 17:00.367
He was just here.

17:00.367 --> 17:01.933
This can't be happening.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.067
Oh, my God, Grenouille is gone,
and I'm gonna kill myself.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.400
Grenouille.
[alarm blaring]

17:07.400 --> 17:09.067
Grenouille!

17:10.067 --> 17:12.800
[alarm blaring]

17:12.800 --> 17:14.633
What is going on?

17:14.633 --> 17:16.233
They said
there's a baby missing.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.867
It is so loud.

17:17.867 --> 17:20.600
Oh, my God,
that's terrifying.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.200
Do you know anything
about this missing baby?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.733
That mother must be--

17:24.733 --> 17:26.200
I can't even imagine.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.767
I heard she was
out of her mind,

17:27.767 --> 17:29.233
running all
up and down the halls

17:29.233 --> 17:31.067
looking
for poor little Gren-wee.

17:31.067 --> 17:33.267
[rock music]

17:33.267 --> 17:35.633
Grenouille?
Are you sure?

17:35.633 --> 17:36.767
Mm-hmm.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.767
I know, the names today.

17:38.767 --> 17:42.767

17:42.767 --> 17:45.333
And these are smoked salmon
and capers,

17:45.333 --> 17:49.567
and these are duck prosciutto
with, I think, olive tapenade?

17:49.567 --> 17:51.500
Anyway, so, so sorry again.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.633
I'm sure this happens
all the time.

17:54.633 --> 17:57.167
Vanessa, thank God.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.067
What the Jillio?

17:59.067 --> 18:02.833
You're a little overdressed
to deliver a baby, aren't you?

18:02.833 --> 18:06.133
Okay, and things got worse
since we spoke.

18:06.133 --> 18:08.733
I just flagged down
"Tube Socks" Matt Duvane,

18:08.733 --> 18:11.433
oh, yeah, looking
like Girl, Interrupted

18:11.433 --> 18:14.067
in the adult-diapers aisle
of the drugstore.

18:14.067 --> 18:16.533
Didn't have to, chose to.

18:16.533 --> 18:19.700
Well, my day kind of went
off the rails too,

18:19.700 --> 18:21.233
with that guy I met
at Krista's.

[cell phone chimes]

18:23.867 --> 18:26.167

Let me see.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.867
No, worse.

18:30.867 --> 18:33.300
He texted me
an apartment listing.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.200
And that's
why I don't date brokers.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.433

Jill! Brooke's asking for you.

18:38.433 --> 18:40.533
Oh, yes, coming, one sec.

18:40.533 --> 18:43.967
Sorry, she has, like, these
minions at her beck and call.

18:43.967 --> 18:45.333
- Tell me about it.
- Jill!

18:45.333 --> 18:46.400
That's not fair.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.867
I can stay
for another minute.

18:47.867 --> 18:50.733
Don't worry about it.
We'll talk tomorrow.

18:50.733 --> 18:53.067
Okay, bye.
Love you.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.367
Bye.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.400
Honestly, I couldn't have gotten
through this without you.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.967
Oh, it was no biggie.

19:01.967 --> 19:04.733
And I feel like Crystal
took my kids all afternoon.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.467
Should I pay her
a little extra?

19:06.467 --> 19:09.067
Crystal is very well taken
care of.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.467
Right, duh.

19:10.467 --> 19:11.667
All righty.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.800
Of course, she does love
those three-wick candles

19:14.800 --> 19:16.133
at Jill Malone.

19:16.133 --> 19:18.600
Oh, okay.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.467
What a day, right?

19:20.467 --> 19:25.367
You and me, Andy and Lex--
it just feels so right.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.833
You're like the sister
that I never had.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.100
But don't you have
two sisters?

19:30.100 --> 19:34.267
Neither of them would ever do
what you did for me.

19:34.267 --> 19:37.167
I love you.

19:38.933 --> 19:40.367
Okay.

Oh, thank goodness
you're home.

19:51.700 --> 19:55.067
Longest day of my life.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.233
I am broken.

19:56.233 --> 19:57.467
This bag...

19:57.467 --> 20:01.900
contains a $425 candle,

20:01.900 --> 20:06.800
and that is the cheapest errand
that I ran for Brooke all day.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.633
And to top it off,
I lost Grenouille.

20:09.633 --> 20:12.000
Babe, babe, babe, no,
you didn't lose him.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.067
He's right here.
I went back for him.

20:14.067 --> 20:15.400
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.200
I was doing the project
with Hazel.

20:17.200 --> 20:22.133
- Do me a favor, no more favors.
- I'm sorry. Come here.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.100
Oh. Mwah.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.200
Are you okay?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.500
No, I can't shake
this feeling

20:27.500 --> 20:30.600
that we're in too deep,
first with Brooke and now Lex.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.000
We're gonna be okay.
That's just a job.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.600
And what about us moving
to Brooklyn?

20:35.600 --> 20:37.733
I stopped listening
after the sixth message.

20:37.733 --> 20:39.600
Yeah,
that's not happening.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.367
In the end,
I found it super yucky there,

20:42.367 --> 20:45.267
and I say that
having just delivered a baby.

20:45.267 --> 20:48.967
Okay, well, as long as you
canceled the bid on that house.

20:48.967 --> 20:51.533
Oh, my God, the bid!
I forgot to cancel it.

20:51.533 --> 20:53.033
Sháá!

20:55.900 --> 20:56.933
