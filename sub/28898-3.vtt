01:06.045 --> 01:08.087
<i>When Kat was 11 years old,</i>

01:08.089 --> 01:10.967
<i>she went on a family vacation
to Sandals, Jamaica.</i>

01:12.969 --> 01:17.221
I need help!
Someone get this jellyfish off me!

01:17.223 --> 01:21.143
<i>She quickly discovered
that she hated the ocean.</i>

01:29.193 --> 01:33.112
<i>Up until that moment,
Kat had a relatively good life.</i>

01:33.114 --> 01:35.281
<i>I mean, life wasn't amazing,</i>

01:35.283 --> 01:37.908
<i>but it's not like she fantasized
about killing herself.</i>

01:37.910 --> 01:42.705
<i>It was good enough.
She was popular enough, smart enough.</i>

01:42.707 --> 01:46.627
<i>The only thing that was, like,
actually amazing was Daniel.</i>

01:47.920 --> 01:53.090
<i>Daniel was like a dream, like, gorgeous,
like, really nice.</i>

01:53.092 --> 01:57.597
<i>Like, the kind of boy that would text
her every night before bed and say...</i>

01:58.764 --> 02:02.099
<i>And the kind of boy that would meet
her outside of school every morning</i>

02:02.101 --> 02:06.145
<i>just to make sure he could hold her
hand as they walked down the hall.</i>

02:06.147 --> 02:09.106
<i>She could never figure out
why Daniel chose her,</i>

02:09.108 --> 02:11.984
<i>what Daniel actually liked or loved
about her.</i>

02:11.986 --> 02:14.695
<i>She just knew it felt really good.</i>

02:14.697 --> 02:18.409
<i>Whatever. It didn't matter.
It's better not to jinx these things.</i>

02:20.620 --> 02:22.580
- Can I have another one?
- Sure.

02:24.290 --> 02:27.791
<i>During her eight-day stay
on that stupid island,</i>

02:27.793 --> 02:30.671
<i>Kat drank 72 virgin pi√±a coladas.</i>

02:32.006 --> 02:34.217
<i>She was in heaven.</i>

02:37.929 --> 02:40.097
<i>And then she got home.</i>

02:42.350 --> 02:44.769
Oh, my God. What happened?

02:46.229 --> 02:50.231
<i>When Kat had left for Jamaica,
she was 107 pounds,</i>

02:50.233 --> 02:53.819
<i>when she returned,
she weighed in at whopping...</i>

02:55.238 --> 02:56.987
Get up!

02:56.989 --> 03:00.324
<i>Despite being five-two,
which was tall for her age...</i>

03:00.326 --> 03:04.870
<i>her body was not prepared
to house the extra 20 pounds.</i>

03:04.872 --> 03:06.832
<i>It was noticeable.</i>

03:14.465 --> 03:18.844
<i>Kat did her best
to minimize the fallout.</i>

03:25.977 --> 03:29.687
- You're wearing two sweatshirts?
- No.

03:29.689 --> 03:32.731
<i>At least Daniel didn't make a big deal
out of it.</i>

03:32.733 --> 03:36.610
<i>That's why she liked him. He didn't
care about what people thought.</i>

03:36.612 --> 03:39.780
<i>He liked her for whatever reasons
he liked her,</i>

03:39.782 --> 03:43.536
<i>and 20 stupid pounds
would never change that.</i>

03:44.579 --> 03:47.415
<i>Until fourth period.</i>

03:53.337 --> 03:56.964
<i>It wasn't even in Daniel's handwriting.</i>

03:56.966 --> 03:59.010
<i>It was Kendra Sutherland's.</i>

04:02.889 --> 04:06.223
<i>Whatever. Fuck her. Fuck him.</i>

04:06.225 --> 04:09.101
<i>She didn't actually love Daniel.
She was 11.</i>

04:09.103 --> 04:12.855
<i>And when you're 11, you fall in love
with, like, everyone and everything.</i>

04:12.857 --> 04:14.398
<i>It's not real love.</i>

04:14.400 --> 04:17.651
<i>Real love is when you can't exist
without someone,</i>

04:17.653 --> 04:19.695
<i>when you'd rather die than be apart,</i>

04:19.697 --> 04:22.156
<i>and the whole world goes dark,
and nothing else matters</i>

04:22.158 --> 04:23.824
<i>but the person standing
in front of you.</i>

04:23.826 --> 04:27.411
I just want you to know I'm in.
I am all in.

04:27.413 --> 04:30.623
For the first time in 140 years,

04:30.625 --> 04:33.375
I felt something I thought
had been lost to me forever.

04:33.377 --> 04:36.045
<i>Say you'll wait for me.</i>

04:36.047 --> 04:37.713
<i>We love each other.</i>

04:37.715 --> 04:41.342
<i>That's real love,
and those were real men.</i>

04:41.344 --> 04:46.430
<i>Men who'd never leave her,
disappoint her, break her heart.</i>

04:46.432 --> 04:49.727
<i>Real men whose love would spark
and ignite and inspire.</i>

04:54.273 --> 04:58.400
<i>The summer before high school
she started writing fan fiction.</i>

04:58.402 --> 05:00.361
<i>By the year's end, she had become</i>

05:00.363 --> 05:03.155
<i>one of the most prolific
smut writers on Tumblr.</i>

05:03.157 --> 05:07.826
<i>She was known for her AU crossovers
and her consistent NC-17 ratings.</i>

05:07.828 --> 05:11.705
<i>But what made her famous
was her story, "The First Night,"</i>

05:11.707 --> 05:14.458
<i>a 7,000-word fic
that was largely credited</i>

05:14.460 --> 05:17.421
<i>with starting the "Larry Stylinson"
conspiracy theory.</i>

05:19.090 --> 05:23.884
<i>That Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson
of One Direction were secretly fucking.</i>

05:23.886 --> 05:26.722
<i>"It's the first night
of the 'Take Me Home' tour."</i>

05:29.016 --> 05:31.016
London, we've got
a little song for you tonight!

05:31.018 --> 05:33.227
<i>"Louis was unusually nervous.</i>

05:33.229 --> 05:35.980
<i>His mouth was dry, palms sweating,</i>

05:35.982 --> 05:39.817
<i>when suddenly, he felt the press
of Harry's body from behind.</i>

05:39.819 --> 05:44.238
<i>"Harry can sense the nervous tension
"running through Louis's stiff body.</i>

05:44.240 --> 05:46.156
- <i>'What are you doing?'</i>
- <i>'To calm your nerves.'</i>

05:46.158 --> 05:49.577
<i>"'You're my best mate, and this is
what mates do for one another.'</i>

05:49.579 --> 05:54.000
- <i>'But Harry, what if someone sees?'</i>
- <i>'Let them.'</i>

05:58.254 --> 06:01.964
<i>"As Harry takes Louis into his
mouth with surprising ease,</i>

06:01.966 --> 06:04.802
<i>he begins to suck his cock
with torturous finesse."</i>

06:33.789 --> 06:36.290
Kat doesn't even have asthma.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.961
She's just fat
and doesn't wanna exercise.

06:40.796 --> 06:44.381
<i>With 72 hours of publishing
"The First Night,"</i>

06:44.383 --> 06:48.719
<i>it had garnered 184,265 notes,</i>

06:48.721 --> 06:53.682
<i>and then three weeks later, Kat had
amassed over 53,000 followers.</i>

06:53.684 --> 06:58.812
<i>She had become extremely popular...
online.</i>

06:58.814 --> 07:01.565
<i>No one in real life knew
that she was famous.</i>

07:01.567 --> 07:04.735
Whomp, whomp, whomp,
whomp, whomp, whomp...

07:04.737 --> 07:09.281
<i>And no one online knew that her
life was actually super depressing.</i>

07:09.283 --> 07:13.162
Ew! Take those things off.

07:16.582 --> 07:19.583
<i>She'd regularly fantasize
about telling her followers</i>

07:19.585 --> 07:22.086
<i>how much she hated
her school, her town,</i>

07:22.088 --> 07:25.756
<i>and how everyone in it was full
of shit and a fucking asshole.</i>

07:25.758 --> 07:27.341
<i>She'd tell them to surround the school,</i>

07:27.343 --> 07:30.012
<i>show up right after the morning bell
prepared for war.</i>

07:37.436 --> 07:40.729
<i>They'd demand the release
of their queen.</i>

07:40.731 --> 07:42.483
<i>And if anyone even hesitated...</i>

07:47.989 --> 07:51.949
<i>The scary thing is,
is they'd actually do it.</i>

07:51.951 --> 07:55.286
<i>They'd do anything she asked.</i>

07:55.288 --> 07:58.622
<i>That's how much they loved her.</i>

07:58.624 --> 08:04.547
<i>Granted, they didn't know who she was
or what she looked like.</i>

08:09.719 --> 08:11.679
It's me, ThunderKitKat.

08:24.108 --> 08:28.819
<i>And then that video came out.
And they did see what she looked like,</i>

08:28.821 --> 08:30.779
<i>and they still loved her.</i>

08:30.781 --> 08:34.827
<i>And not only did they love her,
they wanted to fuck her.</i>

09:20.873 --> 09:23.624
Hey, I'm Rue. I'm an addict.

09:23.626 --> 09:25.584
Hi, Rue.

09:25.586 --> 09:28.548
And I've been clean for 60 days.

09:30.967 --> 09:33.842
<i>For the record,
I'm not not telling the truth.</i>

09:33.844 --> 09:36.136
<i>I've actually been doing really well.</i>

09:36.138 --> 09:38.055
<i>Because the morning after that whole</i>

09:38.057 --> 09:40.891
<i>drug-dealer-face-tattoo
fentanyl excursion,</i>

09:40.893 --> 09:43.185
<i>I... got in a little bit of trouble...</i>

09:43.187 --> 09:46.313
Oh, shit.

09:46.315 --> 09:49.694
<i>...for disappearing for like 16 hours.</i>

09:51.112 --> 09:53.030
Where have you been?

09:55.658 --> 09:58.617
- I'm sorry. My phone died.
- Bullshit. You're doing drugs.

09:58.619 --> 10:01.036
- I'm not doing drugs.
- Then where have you been?

10:01.038 --> 10:02.788
And why weren't you answering
you phone?

10:02.790 --> 10:05.124
- Why are you sneaking into the house?
- I was with someone.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.376
- Who?
- It... It doesn't matter, Mom.

10:07.378 --> 10:09.461
It matters, Rue.

10:09.463 --> 10:12.172
It matters. You're doing drugs.

10:12.174 --> 10:15.009
Gia, go back to sleep.

10:15.011 --> 10:18.762
- Rue, are you... are you okay?
- I'm fine. You can go back to sleep.

10:18.764 --> 10:22.727
She's okay, baby. Okay, go to bed.
Good night.

10:27.565 --> 10:29.773
I will not allow you
to walk up into this house

10:29.775 --> 10:32.401
at 5:30 in the morning
and lie to my face.

10:32.403 --> 10:35.821
So tell me the truth right now.
Where were you?

10:35.823 --> 10:39.909
I don't want to have to tell you
everything that's going on in my life.

10:39.911 --> 10:43.331
If you want to drug test me,
just drug test me.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.043
<i>She wasn't the only person
upset with me.</i>

10:49.045 --> 10:53.839
I'm not kidding, Rue. I'm not trying to
become best friends with someone

10:53.841 --> 10:56.385
who's gonna fucking kill themself.

10:58.596 --> 11:00.804
I know.

11:00.806 --> 11:03.515
I didn't mean to do this.

11:03.517 --> 11:06.018
I've been through, like...

11:06.020 --> 11:10.231
enough traumatic shit in my life
that I don't...

11:10.233 --> 11:12.399
- I can't like...
- I get it.

11:12.401 --> 11:14.612
I get it.

11:15.988 --> 11:20.243
I don't want to be around you
if you don't stop using drugs.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.291
Okay.

11:31.379 --> 11:34.421
I mean it.

11:34.423 --> 11:38.384
I know. I'll stop.

11:38.386 --> 11:40.346
I promise.

11:41.556 --> 11:44.183
I just need you to do me a favor.

11:46.185 --> 11:48.854
You're not gonna like it.

11:58.197 --> 12:00.990
You're still grounded
until I don't even fucking know.

12:00.992 --> 12:04.495
- What else is there?
- I told you I wasn't lying.

12:18.175 --> 12:25.099
<i>So, I decided to stay clean.
And I have been, for a while.</i>

12:29.395 --> 12:32.813
<i>But I've also been coming
to this meeting for longer.</i>

12:32.815 --> 12:36.400
Girl, it's your 60 days today, right?

12:36.402 --> 12:39.069
Ah! Oh, God. So good!

12:39.071 --> 12:42.364
<i>Hmm, I don't know.
I just didn't want to depress anyone.</i>

12:42.366 --> 12:46.994
<i>Plus, I really have been trying,
and that counts for something.</i>

12:46.996 --> 12:51.457
Two months ago,
I woke up from a comma.

12:51.459 --> 12:53.709
I didn't know what happened,

12:53.711 --> 12:58.214
but from the looks of my mother
and little sister's faces,

12:58.216 --> 13:00.382
I knew that...

13:00.384 --> 13:03.095
whatever it was, whatever I did...

13:04.639 --> 13:06.807
...it wasn't good.

13:11.604 --> 13:14.480
It scared them.

13:14.482 --> 13:16.567
It really scared them.

13:19.570 --> 13:24.490
And, at that moment,
I decided to at least try and change.

13:24.492 --> 13:26.742
'Cause I owe it to them.

13:26.744 --> 13:31.123
I owe it to everyone I love,
and everyone who loves me.

13:35.086 --> 13:38.214
The hardest part, has been...

13:39.382 --> 13:42.843
...feeling like I owe it to myself.

13:44.220 --> 13:48.266
And, maybe that'll get easier.

13:50.977 --> 13:54.438
I hope it will. Thank you.

13:58.860 --> 14:02.486
<i>I don't know. It's just been
a really weird couple of weeks.</i>

14:02.488 --> 14:06.075
I didn't know it at the time,
but Jules was falling in love.

16:30.803 --> 16:32.970
<i>I'm not saying I'm in love.</i>

16:32.972 --> 16:37.433
I'm just saying I really,
really, really like him.

16:37.435 --> 16:41.562
- Who? ShyGuy118?
- His name is Tyler.

16:41.564 --> 16:43.856
It doesn't really matter.
They're both little fuckboy names.

16:43.858 --> 16:48.152
He's not.
For real, like, he's so sweet.

16:48.154 --> 16:51.322
- What school does he go to?
- St. Mary's.

16:51.324 --> 16:54.283
Ew. Private school.

16:54.285 --> 16:56.619
You're just jealous.

16:56.621 --> 17:01.457
<i>Aside from that being a really shitty
thing to say, it's also not true.</i>

17:01.459 --> 17:04.042
<i>She'd just been acting weird all week.</i>

17:04.045 --> 17:05.920
I'm not jealous.

17:05.922 --> 17:09.131
I mean, you've been acting weird,
like, all week.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.715
- What?
- Yeah, like,

17:10.718 --> 17:12.968
every time I'm on my phone,
you just stop talking.

17:12.970 --> 17:16.347
- You're literally like my dad.
- Sorry.

17:16.348 --> 17:18.184
It's fine.

17:20.019 --> 17:22.104
You wanna see his dick?

17:49.882 --> 17:51.634
<i>Stick it out!</i>

17:54.762 --> 17:56.637
<i>What a tiny twink!</i>

17:56.639 --> 17:58.764
<i>Shut it. Just give it...</i>

17:58.766 --> 18:01.060
What the fuck?

18:03.145 --> 18:05.980
<i>Fucking step on it. It's too small,</i>

18:05.982 --> 18:09.942
- <i>It could never satisfy you.</i>
- Kat! Dinner!

18:09.944 --> 18:11.821
I'll get her.

18:12.864 --> 18:15.197
Ay, Jesus, girl.

18:15.199 --> 18:18.242
Kat! Hey!

18:18.244 --> 18:20.327
What?

18:20.329 --> 18:23.916
Take pictures of your toes later.
Dinner's on the table.

18:30.047 --> 18:32.091
Bye. Love you. See ya.

18:37.305 --> 18:41.140
I can't believe I haven't even told you,
how insane my parents are being.

18:41.142 --> 18:44.393
All week long,
she's just been going on and on...

18:44.395 --> 18:46.228
...about how much she hates my dad.

18:46.230 --> 18:50.274
I'm just like, you can't do this to me.
He's my dad.

18:50.276 --> 18:52.610
I don't know. I know
he has issues, but so does she.

18:52.612 --> 18:55.404
And he's not telling me shit about her.

18:55.406 --> 18:58.657
Yeah. That's, like, not cool of your mom
to put you in that situation.

18:58.659 --> 19:02.244
Yeah, but if I say that, then she's
gonna make me an enemy, too.

19:02.246 --> 19:04.538
Literally the last thing
I need right now is...

19:04.540 --> 19:06.957
Who keeps texting you?

19:06.959 --> 19:09.168
- My dad.
- Well, do you want me to respond?

19:09.170 --> 19:13.049
- He's texted you like 15 times.
- No, I'll just... call him later.

19:21.474 --> 19:24.642
I mean, it's huge, right?

19:24.644 --> 19:27.519
- Mm...
- Don't front. It's a big dick.

19:27.521 --> 19:29.855
You know what?
It may be, but, we can't really tell,

19:29.857 --> 19:31.482
'cause it's just fucking
floating in space.

19:31.484 --> 19:34.485
- So?
- So, there's no way to compare scale.

19:34.487 --> 19:36.904
If there's a fucking hand in
the frame, at least you can be,

19:36.906 --> 19:38.447
it's about the size
of an adult male hand.

19:38.449 --> 19:41.408
Or like twice the size.
Or a fucking fraction of the size.

19:41.410 --> 19:44.872
Rue. This is an objectively big dick.

19:48.334 --> 19:51.921
Some people say that eyes
are the windows to the soul.

19:53.256 --> 19:55.089
I disagree.

19:55.091 --> 19:58.219
I think it's your dick and how
you fucking photograph it.

19:59.679 --> 20:05.266
There are two different types
of dick pics.

20:05.268 --> 20:08.310
Solicited, and unsolicited.

20:08.312 --> 20:11.814
Solicited makes up for about one percent
of all dick pics sent and received.

20:11.816 --> 20:15.734
But within that one percent,
there are three categories.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.862
Jules?

20:17.864 --> 20:21.448
Terrifying, horrifying,
and acceptable.

20:21.450 --> 20:23.033
I know what some of you
are thinking.

20:23.035 --> 20:26.495
Rue, terrifying and horrifying
sound like the same thing.

20:26.497 --> 20:30.918
Well, to a trained eye,
it could be the difference between...

20:32.670 --> 20:36.716
Yo, sorry about the mess.
My mom's, like, out of town?

20:38.593 --> 20:40.136
A basic hygiene issue.

20:41.262 --> 20:43.139
<i>Or...</i>

20:49.020 --> 20:51.145
<i>...or a life or death situation.</i>

20:51.147 --> 20:52.899
So, here are some key things
to look out for.

20:54.150 --> 20:58.946
Uncapped deodorant
touching the floor. Horrifying.

21:00.281 --> 21:03.115
Jug of lotion.

21:03.117 --> 21:04.950
Terrifying.

21:04.952 --> 21:08.120
Dirty fingernails.

21:08.122 --> 21:10.706
Horrifying.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.708
A medieval sword?

21:12.710 --> 21:14.668
Run-for-your-fucking-life terrifying.

21:14.670 --> 21:20.218
So, what constitutes this rarefied,
sought after, acceptable dick pic?

21:22.428 --> 21:24.720
Wow. Okay.

21:24.722 --> 21:28.392
So his penis is the size
of an Evian bottle.

21:30.019 --> 21:32.394
- Well, the lighting is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

21:32.396 --> 21:35.022
- His room looks clean.
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.024 --> 21:37.316
- Looks well-groomed.
- Right?

21:37.318 --> 21:39.777
Okay, yeah. I'm beginning
to understand the appeal.

21:39.779 --> 21:41.612
Thank you.

21:41.614 --> 21:43.364
But here's the thing.

21:43.366 --> 21:46.575
I sent him a few pics from
the school bathroom during class.

21:46.577 --> 21:49.036
- Wait. Like, nudes?
- I can't talk about it.

21:49.038 --> 21:53.415
- But I need your help.
- Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

21:53.417 --> 21:57.378
I want, like, good,
professional partial nudes.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.672
Like, classy, but not too arty.

21:59.674 --> 22:02.341
Like, like I took them
with very little thought or effort

22:02.343 --> 22:04.718
but could also be in fucking MOMA.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.428
<i>Be cool, Rue.</i>

22:06.430 --> 22:08.933
- Yeah. It's, like, easy. Whatever.
- Yeah.

22:12.144 --> 22:17.316
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.

22:18.651 --> 22:21.694
Hey. Look at you, still doing
the grapefruit diet.

22:21.696 --> 22:23.529
Yep, I literally wanna die.

22:23.531 --> 22:25.823
Yeah. It's only bad
for the first two weeks.

22:25.825 --> 22:31.495
Then your stomach shrinks,
and you adjust, and you are reborn.

22:31.497 --> 22:33.581
Oh, wow. Can't wait.

22:33.583 --> 22:36.252
- How much?
- That'll be $3.25.

22:38.337 --> 22:43.551
Yo, can you please,
maybe hurry the fuck up?

22:45.136 --> 22:47.219
Could I pay you the rest tomorrow?

22:47.221 --> 22:51.307
- I'm sorry, baby. There's a policy.
- Hey, Kat, I, I gotcha.

22:51.309 --> 22:54.602
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. How you doing?

22:54.604 --> 22:57.271
- I'm good. How are you?
- Sweet. I'm good.

22:57.273 --> 22:59.857
- Hey, Erika. How much was it?
- $3.25.

22:59.859 --> 23:02.610
I have, like, $1.25 here.

23:02.612 --> 23:04.945
Do you... For a grapefruit?

23:04.947 --> 23:07.573
- Do you want something else to eat?
- Oh, no.

23:07.575 --> 23:09.491
No, 'cause if you don't have
enough money on you right now,

23:09.493 --> 23:11.160
I can get you,
like, some actual food, or...

23:11.162 --> 23:15.416
She's doing the grapefruit diet.
It's not easy. Don't tempt her.

23:17.293 --> 23:19.376
Okay.

23:19.378 --> 23:21.629
Cool.

23:21.631 --> 23:23.464
All right.

23:23.466 --> 23:25.925
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well...

23:25.927 --> 23:30.471
- I'll see you in, biology.
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

23:30.473 --> 23:32.431
- Yeah. Sure.
- Goodbye.

23:32.433 --> 23:34.266
- Aw, man, do it upright.
- Fuck it.

23:34.268 --> 23:36.938
- Aw, you got moked out.
- You suck, man.

23:40.942 --> 23:43.651
So you're basically
in a long-distance relationship.

23:43.653 --> 23:45.444
No, we like FaceTime every night.

23:45.446 --> 23:48.364
Aw, that's so sweet.
You guys are full-on in love.

23:48.366 --> 23:50.241
Oh, my God. Stop!

23:50.243 --> 23:52.785
- I really like you.
- <i>I like you, too, Cassie.</i>

23:52.787 --> 23:54.664
I like you more.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.165
We are not in love.

23:58.167 --> 24:00.376
But he did invite me
to spend the weekend with him.

24:00.378 --> 24:04.004
- Like, the whole weekend?
- Yeah, like Friday and Saturday night.

24:04.006 --> 24:05.673
Wait, is your mom gonna let you go?

24:05.675 --> 24:08.842
It doesn't matter. I'll just kill her
in her sleep if she doesn't let me.

24:08.844 --> 24:13.015
- Sounds like true love to me.
- Whatever. She can't stop me.

24:14.141 --> 24:17.979
- Honestly, I love your mom...
- Yeah, well try living with her.

24:25.570 --> 24:28.112
Do any of you guys
know how Bitcoin works?

24:28.114 --> 24:30.573
- Hmm. No.
- No.

24:30.575 --> 24:32.283
But you know who probably does?

24:32.285 --> 24:36.078
It's a worldwide cryptocurrency
and digital payment system.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.289
I literally have no clue
what you're talking about.

24:38.291 --> 24:41.750
Well, there's no easier way
to explain it.

24:41.752 --> 24:45.045
Look, why don't you just tell
us what you're trying to do,

24:45.047 --> 24:47.216
and we can tell you how we can help.

24:48.217 --> 24:51.927
- Unless it's human trafficking.
- I don't fuck with human trafficking.

24:51.929 --> 24:55.389
I'm not... human trafficking.

24:55.391 --> 24:57.766
Yeah, us, neither.

24:57.768 --> 25:00.436
Okay.

25:00.438 --> 25:02.938
I was just wondering if it's like,

25:02.940 --> 25:06.066
a good way to anonymously
get money online.

25:06.068 --> 25:08.736
That's literally what it's made for.

25:08.738 --> 25:10.323
Dumb ass.

25:11.532 --> 25:12.950
Cool.

25:16.162 --> 25:20.041
- I feel like that's it.
- No, it's good, it's good. I like it.

25:26.047 --> 25:28.380
Wait. Yeah, that really does
look like I took it.

25:28.382 --> 25:29.965
- Right?
- Okay.

25:29.967 --> 25:31.636
- It's good.
- Yeah.

25:45.942 --> 25:47.900
- Got it.
- Do I look hot?

25:47.902 --> 25:50.945
- Yeah.
- Hot enough that you'd want to fuck me,

25:50.947 --> 25:53.280
or like, cute?

25:53.282 --> 25:57.660
Like... like me?
Or like him, me?

25:57.662 --> 25:59.455
Either.

26:00.957 --> 26:02.540
Yeah.

26:02.542 --> 26:04.708
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

26:04.710 --> 26:07.380
Should I, like, show more? Like...

26:08.631 --> 26:11.799
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

26:11.801 --> 26:16.220
I... I mean, it's... whatever.
Whatever you, like to do.

26:16.222 --> 26:19.350
I mean, what do you think, though?

26:21.185 --> 26:22.853
...fuck.

26:23.896 --> 26:27.022
It's my mom.

26:27.024 --> 26:30.444
Hey, Mom.
I'm just at Jules's house.

26:33.489 --> 26:38.284
Well I have NA tonight.
So, like nine-thirty-ish?

26:38.286 --> 26:41.914
Okay. love you, too. Bye.

26:44.292 --> 26:46.750
- NA?
- Yeah.

26:46.752 --> 26:49.420
Narcotics anonymous.

26:49.422 --> 26:52.923
Wait. You've been clean
for like, two weeks, right?

26:52.925 --> 26:55.593
- Yeah. That's right.
- Rue!

26:55.595 --> 26:57.970
- What?
- Fuck you, come here!

26:57.972 --> 27:01.726
- What?
- You've been... Come here! Oh, my God!

27:07.356 --> 27:09.899
I'm so proud of you.

27:09.901 --> 27:13.279
<i>I've never met anyone
in my entire life like Jules.</i>

27:20.161 --> 27:22.745
I'm gonna go get
a glass of water really quick.

27:22.747 --> 27:24.957
- Okay.
- Whatever, bitch.

27:50.775 --> 27:52.777
<i>Oh, fuck me.</i>

27:53.778 --> 27:56.280
Fuck.

28:15.883 --> 28:18.259
- I gotta go. But, love you.
- Okay.

28:18.261 --> 28:20.010
And I'll see you later.

28:20.012 --> 28:21.554
- Bye.
- Love you.

28:21.556 --> 28:23.516
Love you, too.

29:18.404 --> 29:23.157
<i>And, at that moment, I decided
to at least try and change.</i>

29:23.159 --> 29:26.827
'Cause I owe it to them.

29:26.829 --> 29:31.624
I owe it to everyone I love
and everyone that loves me.

29:31.626 --> 29:34.962
And, maybe... that'll get easier.

29:37.048 --> 29:41.010
I hope it will. Thank you.

30:01.906 --> 30:05.783
Yo. Sixty days, no small feat.

30:05.785 --> 30:07.868
Thanks.

30:07.870 --> 30:10.665
- Very moving share.
- Thank you.

30:12.500 --> 30:16.295
Can I ask you something?
How'd you survive that OD?

30:20.258 --> 30:23.719
- What do you mean?
- Somebody had to save your life, right?

30:24.720 --> 30:28.182
- It was my sister.
- Aw, man.

30:29.267 --> 30:32.103
- Older or younger?
- Younger.

30:33.145 --> 30:36.440
- I have to get home, so...
- Like 12, 13?

30:37.733 --> 30:42.570
- I don't really understand what the...
- Curiosity.

30:42.572 --> 30:44.947
Yeah. She was 13.

30:44.949 --> 30:47.950
That's some heavy shit. But, hey.

30:47.952 --> 30:50.578
We've all done some bad shit
in our lives, right?

30:50.580 --> 30:52.746
Comes with the territory.

30:52.748 --> 30:57.042
But, man, now you just got me
thinking about...

30:57.044 --> 31:00.504
what that does to a 13-year-old,
a 13-year-old kid,

31:00.506 --> 31:02.967
who finds her big sister overdosed.

31:03.926 --> 31:06.135
What that moment
must do to somebody...

31:06.137 --> 31:08.762
how it affects
the rest of their lives, you know,

31:08.764 --> 31:11.599
how it affects their ability to trust.

31:11.601 --> 31:16.186
Leaves it hard for them to get close
to people, you know, relationships.

31:16.188 --> 31:19.106
Makes it hard for them to fall in love.

31:19.108 --> 31:21.901
Living with the fear
that at any moment,

31:21.903 --> 31:25.821
the rug can be ripped out from under
them, and they lose everything.

31:25.823 --> 31:28.866
Especially the people
that they love.

31:28.868 --> 31:33.037
You ever think about that?
Yeah, probably fucked up for life.

31:33.039 --> 31:36.999
But, hey, you're gonna have
to make peace with that.

31:37.001 --> 31:38.834
Just like you're gonna have
to make peace with the fact

31:38.836 --> 31:40.961
that you could be responsible
for some shit like that,

31:40.963 --> 31:42.713
and then get up in front
of a whole group of people

31:42.715 --> 31:44.340
who are struggling
with the same issues,

31:44.342 --> 31:48.054
and lie about being clean.
You know what I'm saying?

31:50.514 --> 31:54.185
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Listen, young blood.

31:57.355 --> 32:00.940
You're playing pool
with Minnesota Fats.

32:00.942 --> 32:03.234
Who is Minnesota Fats?

32:03.236 --> 32:06.195
The greatest motherfucking pool player
that ever lived.

32:06.197 --> 32:08.155
Okay.

32:08.157 --> 32:10.076
I'm Ali.

32:12.328 --> 32:15.204
Let me know when you want
to stop trying to kill yourself

32:15.206 --> 32:17.208
and eat some pancakes.

32:33.349 --> 32:36.102
<i>How was NA today?</i>

32:38.938 --> 32:41.647
It was good. I...

32:41.649 --> 32:44.733
celebrated 60 days today.

32:44.735 --> 32:48.114
- I'm really proud of you, Rue.
- Thanks.

32:57.915 --> 33:00.835
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:02.587 --> 33:06.924
- Whatcha doin'?
- Watching <i>My So-Called Life.</i>

33:08.843 --> 33:11.760
- Fuckin' Jordan Catalano.
- I know, right?

33:11.762 --> 33:13.431
Right.

33:20.396 --> 33:24.023
Please promise me you will never fall
for a Jordan Catalano.

33:24.025 --> 33:26.235
But he's so cute.

33:30.198 --> 33:32.698
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
It's okay.

33:32.700 --> 33:35.203
Okay.

33:43.044 --> 33:45.211
Hey.

33:45.213 --> 33:47.171
Hello.

33:47.173 --> 33:49.759
Oh, shit. No!

33:51.093 --> 33:52.929
Oh.

33:54.347 --> 33:56.265
Okay.

34:02.605 --> 34:05.356
<i>Kit... KittenKween?</i>

34:05.358 --> 34:09.443
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Hi. I'm really excited to meet you.</i>

34:09.445 --> 34:13.405
<i>I've seen you dance in that video,
like, a hundred times.</i>

34:13.407 --> 34:16.242
- Really?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i> I love your confidence.

34:16.244 --> 34:18.786
<i>Well, Jesus fucking Christ,
you've gotta be one of the most</i>

34:18.788 --> 34:21.830
<i>beautiful creatures I've ever seen.</i>

34:21.831 --> 34:23.666
I don't...
I don't know about that, but...

34:23.668 --> 34:27.210
<i>No, I'm serious. I'm not even
joshing you. I mean... Jesus.</i>

34:27.213 --> 34:30.714
<i>But, I am gonna warn you.</i>

34:30.716 --> 34:32.969
<i>I'm kind of... I'm kind of an odd duck.</i>

34:36.138 --> 34:40.056
<i>I mean, I'm serious.
I got some extreme kinks.</i>

34:40.059 --> 34:42.893
- Okay.
- <i>But, I'm real gentle.</i>

34:42.895 --> 34:45.020
- <i>You wanna see something?</i>
- Sure.

34:45.022 --> 34:48.192
- <i>It's kind of embarrassing.</i>
- Why?

34:57.493 --> 34:59.618
- <i>Well, what are you laughing at?</i>
- Oh, no...

34:59.620 --> 35:01.871
<i>Have you ever seen
a penis this small before?</i>

35:01.873 --> 35:04.290
Oh, my God. No, no, no.
It's not small.

35:04.292 --> 35:07.001
- <i>Don't lie to me.</i>
- I... I'm not lying.

35:07.003 --> 35:10.337
- I'm not lying.
- <i>Tell me that you'd never fuck me.</i>

35:10.339 --> 35:15.259
- Wait. What?
- <i>Tell me that you'd never fuck me.</i>

35:15.261 --> 35:16.802
<i>That I'm a pathetic loser.</i>

35:16.804 --> 35:20.180
<i>And I could never satisfy some
beautiful princess like you.</i>

35:20.182 --> 35:23.100
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

35:23.102 --> 35:29.940
- <i>Come on, tell me you'd never fuck me.</i>
- I wouldn't. I really wouldn't.

35:29.942 --> 35:32.443
- <i>Tell me I'm a loser.</i>
- Are you crying?

35:32.445 --> 35:34.989
<i>Tell me I'm a pathetic loser
with a baby dick.</i>

35:37.867 --> 35:40.409
- <i>Yeah, keep making fun of me.</i>
- Wait.

35:40.411 --> 35:43.579
- You want me to make fun of you?
- <i>Oh, yes, KittenKween.</i>

35:43.581 --> 35:45.541
<i>Come on. It turns me on.</i>

35:49.086 --> 35:52.046
I mean, I mean, your dick is,
like, really, really small.

35:52.048 --> 35:54.465
- <i>How small is it?</i>
- Like, medically small.

35:54.467 --> 35:57.134
Like, really tiny,
and I can barely see it.

35:57.136 --> 35:59.136
<i>I know. I'm pathetic.</i>

35:59.138 --> 36:01.263
And no woman would ever fuck you,
because you're a big,

36:01.265 --> 36:03.474
disgusting piece of shit!

36:03.476 --> 36:06.185
<i>I am! I am!</i>

36:06.187 --> 36:08.729
<i>Keep laughing at me!
Keep laughing at me!</i>

36:08.731 --> 36:11.232
- <i>Tell me to stop touching it.</i>
- Please stop touching it.

36:11.234 --> 36:13.776
You're gonna make me throw up.
Stop it!

36:13.778 --> 36:15.361
<i>Okay, okay. Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

36:15.363 --> 36:18.280
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, KittenKween.
I'm sorry.</i>

36:18.282 --> 36:21.283
So you...
so you'd do anything I tell you?

36:21.285 --> 36:24.411
- <i>KittenKween, I'd do anything you want.</i>
- Why?

36:24.413 --> 36:27.706
<i>Because you're big,
and beautiful, and powerful, and...</i>

36:27.708 --> 36:29.625
<i>I want you to take
complete control of me.</i>

36:29.627 --> 36:31.754
<i>I want you to tell me...</i>

36:31.963 --> 36:35.297
<i>when I can come,
and when I can't come.</i>

36:35.299 --> 36:37.967
<i>And I want you to punish me
when I cheat.</i>

36:37.969 --> 36:41.887
- Punish you, like, how?
- <i>I want you to fine me.</i>

36:41.889 --> 36:44.265
- Wait. Like, like, money?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

36:44.267 --> 36:46.519
<i>I wanna be your cash pig.</i>

36:48.104 --> 36:51.689
<i>But Kat didn't actually, like,
believe him.</i>

36:51.691 --> 36:55.568
<i>Until... three days later
when she got a message.</i>

36:55.570 --> 36:57.653
I wanna look cute, but not eager.

36:57.655 --> 36:59.699
Then don't wear that top.

36:59.907 --> 37:02.575
This? I thought it looked good.

37:02.577 --> 37:05.538
I don't really know
if I like this body suit, though.

37:11.294 --> 37:16.714
<i>And within minutes, $100 in Bitcoin
was transferred to her.</i>

37:16.716 --> 37:19.425
What are you looking at?

37:19.427 --> 37:23.345
Nothing. Just this, article.

37:23.347 --> 37:25.141
About what?

37:26.183 --> 37:29.101
You know, like... the Holocaust.

37:29.103 --> 37:31.022
Oh. Cool.

37:32.899 --> 37:35.401
- Love that.
- Like, perf.

37:36.694 --> 37:40.112
- Lex?
- It's cute.

37:40.114 --> 37:42.158
I wish I had your collar bones.

37:44.702 --> 37:47.286
I'm putting a lot of trust into you.

37:47.288 --> 37:50.873
- Yeah, Cassie, don't get pregnant.
- That's not funny, Kat.

37:50.875 --> 37:53.500
But don't you dare get pregnant.

37:53.502 --> 37:55.544
Relax, Mom. He has a roommate.

37:55.546 --> 37:58.297
I want you to keep your phone on
throughout the night.

37:58.299 --> 38:00.674
You send me a photo
when you get back to the dorm

38:00.676 --> 38:04.261
- ...with a clock in it.
- Like a ransom photo?

38:04.263 --> 38:07.223
- I hate you.
- Well, I love you.

38:07.225 --> 38:09.268
I love you, too.

38:11.062 --> 38:13.397
Have fun, baby girl.

38:16.359 --> 38:19.360
No funny business, Christopher!

38:19.362 --> 38:22.698
- Yeah, no, I promise.
- Yeah, just be a gentleman.

38:25.868 --> 38:28.037
And don't you dare get pregnant.

38:41.884 --> 38:45.012
- That was amazing.
- I know.

39:23.676 --> 39:25.761
Oh, my God. Fuck.

39:28.723 --> 39:31.432
Hey, my mom called. I gotta go.

39:31.434 --> 39:33.978
- Okay, I love you. Bye.
- Love you, too.

39:52.205 --> 39:55.249
- Out of my way, dick.
- Okay, bitch.

39:57.418 --> 40:00.586
This is, like, the craziest party
I've ever been to.

40:00.588 --> 40:02.296
I just want to make it
through initiation.

40:02.298 --> 40:04.884
You will.

40:09.722 --> 40:12.556
Kill the fucking music!

40:12.558 --> 40:14.934
Kill the fucking music!

40:14.936 --> 40:19.813
All right, listen up, bitches!
We got some fresh meat up in here.

40:19.815 --> 40:23.319
I want all your pledgie faggots
up against the wall!

40:24.820 --> 40:28.322
- Don't lose, bitch!
- Fuck you, bitch! Drink this shit!

40:28.324 --> 40:31.619
- Woo!
- Last one to finish gets stripped naked.

40:35.706 --> 40:37.583
Go, McKay!

40:39.252 --> 40:41.420
Woo!

40:42.505 --> 40:46.050
Yeah! Yeah! Woo!

40:54.183 --> 40:55.766
Woo!

40:55.768 --> 40:57.812
Yo! Strip that faggot!

41:06.404 --> 41:09.655
- Is it still alive?
- Of course it's still fucking alive.

41:09.657 --> 41:11.325
Fuck that, dude.

41:13.870 --> 41:15.788
I don't know, dude.

41:25.506 --> 41:27.923
Follow my lead.

41:27.925 --> 41:31.093
Oh!

41:31.095 --> 41:35.474
McKay brought the baddest bitch
in the fucking game, yo!

42:24.190 --> 42:26.150
<i>This is so depressing.</i>

42:50.967 --> 42:53.511
- What's up?
- What's up, Kat?

43:00.601 --> 43:02.562
- Hey.
- What's up?

43:07.483 --> 43:10.236
Mm... received. All right.

43:14.448 --> 43:18.576
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 100.

43:18.578 --> 43:20.997
Twenty, 40, and 60.

43:22.123 --> 43:25.958
- One-sixty?
- Twenty percent banking fee.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.712
Fine.

43:29.005 --> 43:31.382
Pleasure doing business with you.

43:34.427 --> 43:39.138
Do you think people are 100
percent straight? 100 percent gay?

43:39.140 --> 43:44.351
No, 'cause obviously there's, like,
bi people, asexual, pan...

43:44.353 --> 43:48.898
- Sexuality is, like, a spectrum.
- Yeah. Totally.

43:48.900 --> 43:51.235
- Why?
- I don't know.

43:54.864 --> 43:58.240
Do you think straight guys
ever, like, watch gay porn?

43:58.242 --> 44:00.576
Not if they're
a hundred percent straight.

44:00.578 --> 44:02.328
You just said it's a spectrum.

44:02.330 --> 44:06.040
Yeah, on either side of the spectrum
is gay and straight.

44:06.042 --> 44:08.292
I fucking hate this.

44:08.294 --> 44:13.505
- Is this about Nate?
- No. He's, like, super straight.

44:13.507 --> 44:15.925
- Is it about your dad?
- No.

44:15.927 --> 44:19.637
- It would explain why they're fighting.
- It's not about any guy that I know.

44:19.639 --> 44:25.517
All I know is that most guys are, like,
weird, gross, and fucking pathetic.

44:25.519 --> 44:27.186
Okay, look, if I tell you something,

44:27.188 --> 44:30.064
you swear on your fucking life
you won't say a word?

44:30.066 --> 44:31.817
Yeah.

44:39.242 --> 44:41.617
Hey.

44:41.619 --> 44:43.911
You're home.

44:43.913 --> 44:45.498
Thanks for the weekend.

44:51.254 --> 44:54.674
- I love you.
- I love you more.

45:06.936 --> 45:08.811
Sorry, we're about to close.

45:08.813 --> 45:11.313
Oh, just...
I want to try a few things on.

45:11.315 --> 45:14.193
Okay. Be quick.

45:30.793 --> 45:33.045
Hey.

45:34.338 --> 45:37.425
- Can I ask your opinion on something?
- Yeah, sure.

45:40.553 --> 45:42.555
How does this look?

45:54.150 --> 45:57.695
Yo! You hear me?
I said we're about to close.

45:59.655 --> 46:01.655
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

46:01.657 --> 46:05.242
- I just wanted to buy these.
- Cool.

46:05.244 --> 46:07.328
You live around here?

46:07.330 --> 46:09.330
- No, no.
- No, word.

46:09.332 --> 46:12.627
- This place sucks.
- Yeah.

46:14.670 --> 46:17.465
- I'll ring you up.
- Okay.

47:14.105 --> 47:16.438
Ooh. You look different.

47:16.440 --> 47:18.649
What?

47:18.651 --> 47:20.695
You look different.

47:22.071 --> 47:23.739
I changed.

47:31.831 --> 47:34.498
Rue!

47:34.500 --> 47:37.042
- Hey.
- Guess what?

47:37.044 --> 47:39.420
What?

47:39.422 --> 47:41.672
Okay, well, actually, first,

47:41.674 --> 47:45.634
you are the best soft-core
pornographer in the game.

47:45.636 --> 47:47.428
So thank you.

47:47.430 --> 47:51.181
And second... Tyler wants to meet.

47:51.183 --> 47:53.350
- Like, for real?
- Yeah.

47:53.352 --> 47:54.894
- In, like, person?
- Yeah.

47:54.896 --> 47:57.062
That's cool. Where?

47:57.064 --> 47:59.440
- The lake.
- When?

47:59.442 --> 48:02.318
On Saturday, after the carnival.

48:02.320 --> 48:07.239
- Like at... at night?
- Of course. Yeah.

48:07.241 --> 48:11.493
That doesn't...
seem, like, a little weird?

48:11.495 --> 48:14.788
No. Sis, you watch
way too much <i>Dateline.</i>

48:14.790 --> 48:18.751
Relax, like, he's our age. It's fine.

48:18.753 --> 48:21.545
Jules, you don't think that maybe...

48:21.547 --> 48:25.799
you should like meet him
at the carnival, like, in public?

48:25.801 --> 48:28.886
I mean, we can't, like...

48:28.888 --> 48:32.932
He's a jock.
His mom is super conservative.

48:32.934 --> 48:34.516
It's, like, a tough situation.
It doesn't work.

48:34.518 --> 48:37.478
Honestly, Jules, I don't really
care about the situation,

48:37.480 --> 48:39.271
because it just doesn't seem safe.

48:39.273 --> 48:42.066
I've been in situations
that are way less safe. Like...

48:42.068 --> 48:44.068
Okay, but that's not
really the point, right?

48:44.070 --> 48:47.446
The point is, it's dangerous.

48:47.448 --> 48:50.991
Rue, this is the difference
between, like, you and me. Like...

48:50.993 --> 48:53.035
I don't always get the privilege
of meeting people

48:53.037 --> 48:56.497
in front of a fucking audience.
People here know I'm trans...

48:56.499 --> 48:58.374
That doesn't mean that you
have to meet this dude

48:58.376 --> 49:00.876
at a fucking deserted lake
in the middle of nowhere.

49:00.878 --> 49:03.089
Okay? It seems insane.

49:04.340 --> 49:08.968
Out of everyone in the world,
I wanted to tell you.

49:08.970 --> 49:12.555
'Cause I thought you'd be happy.

49:12.557 --> 49:14.225
But fuck it.

50:05.902 --> 50:08.152
- Hey, Rue.
- Hey, is Jules here?

50:08.154 --> 50:10.404
- Yeah, she's upstairs.
- Can I...

50:10.406 --> 50:12.615
- Of course. Come on.
- Okay.

50:12.617 --> 50:15.453
Jules, Rue's here!

50:27.548 --> 50:29.467
Hey.

50:31.135 --> 50:33.886
I don't want to fight with you.

50:33.888 --> 50:36.265
I don't want to fight with you, either.

50:42.855 --> 50:46.315
You have to understand that
I just want you to be safe, okay?

50:46.317 --> 50:50.029
I just, I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

50:52.323 --> 50:54.573
And, you know,
you just can't be mad at me

50:54.575 --> 50:56.575
for wanting you to be okay.

50:56.577 --> 50:59.245
You can say I'm being anxious,
you know?

50:59.247 --> 51:01.330
Just...

51:01.332 --> 51:04.542
It hurts my heart too much. And...

51:04.544 --> 51:07.920
- It just, I...
- I'm not mad at you.

51:07.922 --> 51:10.172
You're the best thing that's happened
to me in a really long time,

51:10.174 --> 51:12.633
and I just don't want...

51:12.635 --> 51:15.719
anything bad to happen, so please
don't be mad at me.

51:15.721 --> 51:18.182
- Just don't be mad.
- I'm sorry.

51:21.185 --> 51:23.477
I get it.

51:23.479 --> 51:25.729
I love you.

51:25.731 --> 51:28.232
I really do.

51:28.234 --> 51:30.069
I love you, too.

51:39.912 --> 51:43.583
- You're a mess, you know that?
- So are you.

51:49.797 --> 51:53.134
I hate everyone else in the world
but you.

52:04.437 --> 52:07.815
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I should go.

52:09.150 --> 52:10.610
Fuck!

52:22.121 --> 52:24.997
- Who is it?
- Rue: <i>It's me. Open the door.</i>

52:24.999 --> 52:26.834
Fuck.

52:29.503 --> 52:33.047
Not today, Rue. I'm sorry.

52:33.049 --> 52:36.300
- Come on, man. Don't be a dick.
- Nah, I'm serious.

52:36.302 --> 52:38.802
You can't come in.

52:38.804 --> 52:42.264
Look, man...
All I need is just, like, a few OCs.

52:42.266 --> 52:44.266
Sorry, I can't help you.

52:44.268 --> 52:46.852
Fez, I've had a really
fucked up day, all right?

52:46.854 --> 52:49.063
It's been a really fucked up day.

52:49.065 --> 52:51.815
So I need you to open the door
for me, okay?

52:51.817 --> 52:54.403
I'm not gonna help you
kill yourself, Rue.

52:56.739 --> 53:00.908
I'm sorry, but, you can't be coming
over here no more.

53:00.910 --> 53:03.577
- Just go home.
- Don't... Fez!

53:03.579 --> 53:05.871
Don't close the... Fuck!

53:05.873 --> 53:09.041
Fez, open the fucking door, please?

53:09.043 --> 53:12.670
I'm begging you just to open the door.

53:12.672 --> 53:15.464
Fez! You're full of shit, man.

53:15.466 --> 53:18.634
You make your living off
of selling drugs to teenagers.

53:18.636 --> 53:22.471
Now all of a sudden, you want to
have a fucking moral high ground?

53:22.473 --> 53:25.849
You're a fucking dropout drug dealer.
You know that?

53:25.851 --> 53:30.980
You're a fucking drug dealer with seven
functioning fucking brain cells.

53:30.982 --> 53:33.025
Open the door!

53:34.193 --> 53:38.404
Fuck you! Fuck you, Fez. Okay?

53:38.406 --> 53:40.656
Are you doing this because you care
about me?

53:40.658 --> 53:43.242
If you gave a shit about me,
you wouldn't have sold me

53:43.244 --> 53:45.744
the fucking drugs
in the first place!

53:45.746 --> 53:48.956
But you did! You fucking did!

53:48.958 --> 53:51.959
So open the goddamned door!

53:51.961 --> 53:53.669
Open the door!

53:53.671 --> 53:56.505
- I can't do it, Rue. I'm sorry.
- Open the door!

53:56.507 --> 53:58.676
Open the door!

53:59.886 --> 54:01.846
Open the door.

54:05.099 --> 54:07.224
You did this to me!

54:07.226 --> 54:10.646
You fucking... you did this to me, Fez.

54:12.815 --> 54:15.441
You fucking ruined my life!

54:15.443 --> 54:19.820
The least you could do is open
the goddamned door and fix it!

54:19.822 --> 54:23.199
I'm fucking serious.
I'm so fucking serious.

54:23.201 --> 54:27.286
If you don't open this door right now,
I swear to God,

54:27.288 --> 54:30.374
I will hate you,
till the day I fucking die.

54:33.669 --> 54:35.087
I'm sorry.

54:36.672 --> 54:39.926
You fucking did this to me!

54:41.135 --> 54:43.844
Open the fucking door.

54:43.846 --> 54:47.890
Open the door, Fez! Come on, man!

54:47.892 --> 54:49.310
That is so fucked up!

55:23.010 --> 55:26.722
Hey, is this Ali?

55:28.599 --> 55:32.560
This is Rue. I was just calling
to see if maybe you

55:32.562 --> 55:37.024
still wanted to get pancakes
or something?

55:37.179 --> 55:42.179
