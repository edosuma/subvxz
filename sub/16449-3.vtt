00:01.418 --> 00:04.754
So, Aristotle was Plato's student

00:04.796 --> 00:08.382
and Aristotle believes
that your character is voluntary

00:08.425 --> 00:11.552
because it's just the result
of your actions

00:11.595 --> 00:14.680
which are under your control!

00:16.141 --> 00:20.269
For example, right now,
you have made the insane choice

00:20.312 --> 00:23.397
to ignore the person
who is literally trying to save you

00:23.440 --> 00:25.983
from eternal damnation.
- No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.068
Uh, I just...

00:27.611 --> 00:29.987
are we sure we should be
paying attention to these guys?

00:30.113 --> 00:32.949
It's like, who died
and left Aristotle in charge of ethics?

00:34.618 --> 00:35.493
Plato.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.037
Uh, coming!

00:38.247 --> 00:40.248
Uhm... We're just kissing!

00:40.749 --> 00:43.251
And groping?
- What?

00:46.880 --> 00:47.922
Hello!

00:48.590 --> 00:50.383
Tahani, hi!

00:50.425 --> 00:52.552
What brings you here?
- You know, I was just, uh...

00:53.220 --> 00:54.637
"in the Neighbourhood."

00:55.347 --> 00:56.264
Do you get it, Eleanor?

00:56.306 --> 00:58.140
Because you know
we're all in the same afterlife

00:58.183 --> 00:59.600
so you know I'm always
"in the Neighbourhood!"

00:59.643 --> 01:01.018
Do you get it?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.312
I do. And it's delightful.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.731
Anyway, this is for you.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.484
Just a housewarming plant!
It's a little reminder that

01:08.527 --> 01:11.612
if there's ever anything that you need,
I am right next door.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.947
How could I possibly forget?

01:13.448 --> 01:14.907
Have a great day, Tahani.

01:14.950 --> 01:15.866
Oh. Bye.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.162
Ugh. Tahani.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.540
"Welcome to the Neighbourhood

01:22.583 --> 01:24.709
even though we all arrived here
at the same time!

01:24.751 --> 01:28.045
Here's some dirt I put in a bowl,
because I'm amazing!"

01:29.506 --> 01:31.841
I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.

01:31.967 --> 01:35.219
Oh, Chidi. It's a total con.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.097
She only does things like this
so that we will talk about

01:38.140 --> 01:41.767
how "thoughtful" and "wonderful" she is,
but I see through her little act.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.896
Her act of being a nice person
who brings you gifts?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.149
Bingo.
- Okay, I'll... I'll remind you

01:48.191 --> 01:51.027
that you're trying
to learn how to be a good person.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.486
Mm-hmm.
- Maybe you should

01:52.529 --> 01:54.655
return the favour - bring her something.

01:54.698 --> 01:58.826
Oh, so now I'm supposed to be nice
and make friends

01:58.869 --> 02:01.537
and treat her with mutual respect?
- Yeah.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.957
That's exactly what she wants me to do,
Chidi. Wake up!

02:06.793 --> 02:09.754
That... that's what everyone
wants everyone to do.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.137
Hello, Chidi!

02:18.347 --> 02:20.139
No frozen yoghurt for you this morning?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.475
Oh, uh... no, just, uh...
doing some reading.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.768
Ah, been there, brother.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.020
Workin' hard or hardly workin',
am I right?

02:26.063 --> 02:27.021
Hump day.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.564
Uh, sorry.

02:29.232 --> 02:32.360
Janet's functioning as my assistant
but she's a little stiff

02:32.402 --> 02:35.780
so I've been trying to get her to be
a little more casual and conversational.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.907
I'll have what she's having!

02:37.949 --> 02:39.325
It's a work in progress.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.409
Listen, Chidi.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.872
I've been studying your file -
you're a very interesting case.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.708
You essentially only did one thing
while you were on Earth

02:47.918 --> 02:49.877
you thought and wrote about ethics.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.129
Yes. I... I spent eighteen years

02:52.172 --> 02:53.547
working on my manuscript...
- Right.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.966
...called "Who We Are and Who We Are Not..."
- No, no, I...

02:56.009 --> 02:57.677
..."colon - Practical Ethics and Their...
- Mm-hmm.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.345
...Application in the Modern World...
- Yes. Right.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.430
...semi-colon - a Treatise on the..."
- Yes, yes, yes!

03:01.473 --> 03:02.807
That's... that's the one.

03:03.517 --> 03:07.853
But searching for moral truths
isn't really relevant anymore.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.857
Because here in the Good Place
we actually know all the answers.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.528
I think you should experience
new adventures, you know

03:15.570 --> 03:17.613
do things that you haven't done on Earth.

03:18.073 --> 03:21.826
Right? So why don't we meet tomorrow
and try out some new hobbies.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.786
Uh, why not?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.454
I'll... I'll see you guys tomorrow.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.831
Not if I see you first.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.375
Where's the beef?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.043
I don't know.
- Hump day.

03:31.837 --> 03:35.464
Hello, Eleanor!

03:35.674 --> 03:38.134
Jianyu, darling, look -
it's Eleanor from next door!

03:38.719 --> 03:39.593
Is he asleep?

03:40.429 --> 03:42.012
You know, there's really no way to tell.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.931
You know one time
I actually thought he was dead.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.766
But then I remembered
we're all dead, aren't we?

03:45.809 --> 03:48.102
Such fun. Come in! Come on in!

03:48.603 --> 03:50.229
What brings you to our home,
my dear?

03:50.397 --> 03:53.607
Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift

03:53.650 --> 03:56.694
with a housewarming gift of my own.
Fresh pears.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.781
It's a plant, just like your gift,
but you can actually eat them

04:00.824 --> 04:02.450
so maybe it's a better gift?

04:02.492 --> 04:05.369
Who's to say?
- That's so kind.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.623
However, in, um... Chinese culture,
pears are actually a symbol of bad luck.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.084
And I don't want to offend Jianyu,
so I'm afraid

04:12.127 --> 04:13.461
I'm going to have
to throw these in the garbage.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.004
But do come and sit down!

04:17.591 --> 04:20.926
We haven't even had a chance to discuss
all of the mayhem in our neighbourhood yet.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.344
It's so disconcerting.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.638
Yes.
What do you think is causing it?

04:24.848 --> 04:26.015
Oh, I'm sure I don't know.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.850
But we must keep our heads up.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.686
In fact, tomorrow I'm actually going
door-to-door to make sure

04:30.729 --> 04:33.063
that every single person
in this entire neighbourhood

04:33.106 --> 04:35.483
is "keeping calm and carrying on."

04:35.776 --> 04:37.067
'Cause I think that helping others

04:37.110 --> 04:39.528
will make me feel
like I truly belong here, you know?

04:44.117 --> 04:46.660
Here's a brainstorm -
why don't I go with you?

04:47.037 --> 04:50.247
I mean, I would love to do my part
to help the neighbourhood -

04:50.290 --> 04:52.958
not to mention get a little bonding time
with you, lady!

04:53.001 --> 04:54.251
Oh, hurrah!

04:54.753 --> 04:56.712
Such fun!

04:57.839 --> 04:59.673
I'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.259
Wha-what are you talking about?

05:02.511 --> 05:05.137
This note was slipped
under my door yesterday.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.265
It has to be Tahani.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.685
She just said to me,
"I want to feel like I truly belong here."

05:11.853 --> 05:14.188
Well, where have I seen
the word "belong" recently?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.523
Oh, yeah - Ka-plow!

05:15.565 --> 05:19.276
Okay, I really don't think she's the type
of person who would write this.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.779
She is that kind of person,
and she did write it.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.282
She wants everybody to think
she's such a perfect princess

05:25.325 --> 05:29.328
just 'cause she's tall, and glamorous,
and has cappuccino skin

05:29.371 --> 05:32.498
and curves everywhere,
and now I'm complimenting her.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.999
And kind of turned on!

05:34.125 --> 05:36.669
The point is,
she straight-up sucks, bro.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.130
Whoa...

05:40.924 --> 05:42.007
Typical Tahani.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.594
Brings us a faulty plant, so she can brag
about being a better gardener.

05:45.804 --> 05:51.392
No - I think this is another way in which
your negative actions affect this world.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.603
This plant represents
your relationship to Tahani

05:54.646 --> 05:58.315
so when you're mean to her,
it starts to wilt.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.777
Well, then this plant is doomed,
because tomorrow I'm going with her

06:01.820 --> 06:06.156
and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone
that she is secretly a two-faced

06:06.199 --> 06:08.242
calculating, phony bench.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.122
Yeah, truth hurts, doesn't it, plant?

06:16.459 --> 06:17.668
Hello!

06:17.878 --> 06:19.336
Oh! Come on in.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.462
I'll be ready in a jiff.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.215
Jianyu, darling, look -
it's Eleanor from next door again!

06:23.592 --> 06:24.717
The one who brought
the offensive fruit.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.470
Ah, yes. What an embarrassing
blunder on my part.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.222
Oh, no. Don't give it a second thought.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.350
I wouldn't expect anyone else to have
my understanding of international etiquette.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.938
Hey, um... any idea why they gave you
such a big house?

06:38.398 --> 06:42.484
I mean, if we were in America
and... and you had like a big truck

06:42.944 --> 06:45.237
I would think you might be
compensating for something.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.407
Yes, well American men can be very silly.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.950
You know I used to do
quite a cutting impression

06:49.993 --> 06:51.869
of an ex-boyfriend of mine
from the States.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.664
He'd be all like,
"Hey, I'm so rich. I have nine houses.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.541
I'm Leonardo DiCaprio."

06:57.584 --> 06:59.668
It's just so silly.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.796
Anyway, I should've guessed that you
would want to help our neighbourhood.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.132
We are birds of a feather,
you and I.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.218
We make every effort
to be our best selves.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.303
Mmm.

07:10.889 --> 07:12.306
Hey, babe. Got you coffee.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.557
Ah, great.

07:13.975 --> 07:14.892
Oh. Andy's Coffee?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.061
Uh, we shouldn't go there.
Everybody's boycotting.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.813
Yeah, I know that one guy found
a scorpion in his latte.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.732
I don't really care, though,
'cause it's so close to here.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.859
No, no, no, no, it's because
he's sexually harassing people.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.279
Look, a journalist went undercover
for an interview and recorded him.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.405
Here, watch.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.326
<i>Here's the thing, sweetheart.
You are very qualified, but you're also</i>

07:32.369 --> 07:35.037
<i>what we call in the coffee shop game,
a "dog-face."</i>

07:35.330 --> 07:37.539
<i>You're a three,
and you have to be a nine to work here.</i>

07:37.582 --> 07:38.540
<i>It's just math.</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:41.335
<i>So, I didn't get the job?</i>

07:41.753 --> 07:44.296
<i>No! Dog-face,
you didn't get the job.</i>

07:44.923 --> 07:46.882
<i>All right,
I'll check your references.</i>

07:48.218 --> 07:49.718
<i>Just to be...
- Hey, my breasts!</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:52.304
<i>...nice, I'll check them.
Oh! They're good. Honk!</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:54.431
I mean this guy's a monster.
We can't support this guy.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.225
Okay, hey, you're not better than me

07:56.267 --> 07:59.019
just 'cause you won't support a guy
who grabbed a boob once.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.689
No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.023
We can get coffee somewhere else.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.483
<i>Did you know
your left reference</i>

08:04.526 --> 08:06.235
<i>is a little bit bigger
than your right reference?</i>

08:06.403 --> 08:08.487
<i>It's not a bad thing.
It's just... it's a thing.</i>

08:09.864 --> 08:11.991
This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.075
Cartography!

08:13.243 --> 08:16.161
Your neighbourhood stretches way
beyond what you've already seen.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.831
And you can map it

08:19.207 --> 08:22.209
revealing all
of the mysteries, like an explorer!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.003
I see how that might be fun.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.089
Uh, but exploring makes me nervous.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.883
I have what doctors call
"directional insanity."

08:30.010 --> 08:31.802
I once got lost on an escalator.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.013
So, not exactly Christopher Columbus.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.390
Fun fact - Columbus is in the Bad Place

08:36.433 --> 08:39.101
because of all the raping,
slave trade, and genocide.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.480
The fact that it makes you nervous is exactly
why you should do it.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.149
You know,
get out of your comfort zone.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.400
Become a trailblazer.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.738
Fun fact - all deceased members
of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team

08:50.780 --> 08:52.740
are also in the Bad Place.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.991
Ah. Yeah.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.077
Sorry about this.
I steered her away from colloquialisms

08:57.120 --> 08:59.955
and into "fun facts" and trivia titbits.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.999
I thought it'd be more
in her wheelhouse.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.710
Fun fact - a "wheelhouse"
is a part of a boat.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.211
Okay, thank you, Janet.
Thank you.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.755
Fun fact - Janet is me.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.590
All right, let's forget about exploring.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.675
Plenty more ideas for hobbies.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.302
Let's walk back to town, shall we?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.221
Okay. Hang on.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.140
Wrong way!
- Yep!

09:20.435 --> 09:23.729
So all I want to do is just check in,
see how everyone's holding up -

09:23.772 --> 09:26.398
just bring some cheer
to these extraordinary people.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.566
Cool.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.277
So tell me about yourself.

09:30.612 --> 09:35.115
I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend!
The good, the bad, the really bad,

09:35.158 --> 09:36.825
the embarrassing, the humiliating...

09:36.868 --> 09:38.243
just... let's bond!

09:38.620 --> 09:43.040
Okay. Well, I... I was born in Pakistan,
raised in London, schooled in Paris.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.084
But I think the primary reason
I'm in the Good Place

09:45.126 --> 09:47.669
is that I raised quite a lot of money
for non-profit groups.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.924
Oh! Did you ever, uh...
skim a little off the top, for yourself?

09:52.258 --> 09:55.844
Gracious, no! No!
Every penny was accounted for.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.222
And as I raised nearly sixty billion dollars

09:58.264 --> 10:00.015
that was quite a lot of pennies!

10:00.058 --> 10:02.226
But I also dabbled
in some other professions.

10:02.393 --> 10:06.146
I was a model, a museum curator,
and "It Girl," and...

10:06.689 --> 10:08.690
oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse
for a while.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.650
That was quite fun.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.985
Modelling - that's a crazy life.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.738
Wanna tell me about that rock-bottom
you probably hit?

10:14.781 --> 10:15.948
Oh, I didn't really do it for long.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
Couture just doesn't fit my body.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.951
I'm cursed with ample bosom.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.620
And yet, you soldier on!
- Oh, this is silly.

10:21.663 --> 10:24.706
So, "Tahani" means
"congratulations" in Arabic

10:24.749 --> 10:26.375
and Al-Jamil means "beautiful."

10:26.417 --> 10:27.668
So my full name all together means...

10:27.710 --> 10:29.253
"Congratulations, Beautiful."

10:29.295 --> 10:31.588
Thanks, Eleanor! You big flirt.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.176
Extra! Extra!

10:36.594 --> 10:38.595
Read all about you!

10:38.721 --> 10:42.558
Chidi, this is the perfect hobby
for you - journalism.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.185
Well, obviously, I... I like to write.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.063
But I don't love deadlines.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.648
I prefer to take my time with things.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.566
Yes, I know.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.110
Uh, you never even named your dog,
did you?

10:53.153 --> 10:57.739
When it ran away, you posted signs saying,
"Responds to long pauses."

10:57.949 --> 11:02.035
Look, Chidi. I'm just trying to find you
a hobby that - the hat -

11:02.328 --> 11:04.705
that will bring you
a positive experience.

11:05.039 --> 11:05.914
What do you say?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.916
I'm loving that hat on you.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.212
It would look even better on my floor.
- What is happening now?

11:12.255 --> 11:13.797
I suggested she be friendlier.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.092
She seems to have slipped
right into overt sexuality.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.802
I got something you can slip into.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.306
Oh...
- Janet, no! No, Janet!

11:24.017 --> 11:25.767
Well, Glenn, we just wanted
to make sure you were all right.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.102
Tahani! You're too sweet!

11:27.437 --> 11:29.563
Oh.
- Isn't she just the nicest person?

11:29.606 --> 11:30.480
Mm-hmm.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.566
That is what a lot of people
are saying.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.651
Oh, everyone I know is saying that.
- Yeah.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.654
It's just a big neighbourhood
full of enormous mansions

11:37.697 --> 11:39.031
and people who love Tahani!

11:39.407 --> 11:41.617
There's also a heck of a lot of yoghurt.

11:41.659 --> 11:45.537
Excellent observation, Glenn.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.374
Eleanor and I just want to see
if there's anything we can do to help you?

11:49.417 --> 11:51.001
Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful!

11:51.169 --> 11:54.755
Despite all the chaos earlier,
we simply couldn't be happier.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.506
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli!

11:56.549 --> 11:58.175
Please take a maple butter scone.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.593
I made them fresh this morning!

11:59.844 --> 12:01.678
Ooh, they look a bit burnt.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.724
But they're not.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.185
Hmm. Oh, fork, that's good!

12:08.603 --> 12:10.270
Okay!

12:10.313 --> 12:12.356
Arc welding!
You could learn sculpture

12:12.440 --> 12:13.732
you could make furniture

12:13.775 --> 12:16.360
you could get your hands a little greasy,
you know, and you make things!

12:16.861 --> 12:21.573
And, by the way, this is an exact replica
of Brancusi's workshop in Paris.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.909
This equipment is very scary.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.745
Don't be a baby. It can't hurt you.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.623
Watch. I'll blowtorch your face off.
- Janet!

12:29.874 --> 12:32.125
Whatever.
This whole thing is stupid.

12:32.794 --> 12:33.669
Oh, brother.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.338
I told her to be less flirty.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.966
Now she's cruel and distant,
apparently.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.342
I just can't get this right.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.428
Thank you for trying to find me
a new hobby, uh...

12:43.596 --> 12:45.472
but I just want to be an academic.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.100
I want to keep working
on my manuscript.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.436
Chidi, here's the thing.

12:51.479 --> 12:55.482
See, I... I read your whole book -
all thirty-six hundred pages of it.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.277
It's, um... how shall I put this?

12:58.444 --> 12:59.319
It's a mess, dude.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.113
Hey!

13:01.823 --> 13:02.698
She's right.

13:02.865 --> 13:07.327
You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety
of the world's literature in about an hour.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.330
This took me two weeks to get through.

13:10.456 --> 13:11.999
I mean, it's so convoluted!

13:12.041 --> 13:14.876
I just kept reading the same paragraph
over and over again

13:15.169 --> 13:17.212
trying to figure out
what the heck you were saying.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.380
Oh, no.
- I mean, on...

13:18.423 --> 13:22.884
on page one thousand,
you start section two with the sentence -

13:23.261 --> 13:25.929
"Of course,
the exact opposite might be true."

13:26.597 --> 13:32.394
You're a brilliant guy, Chidi,
but you just kept revising, and rewriting

13:32.437 --> 13:34.062
and adding words to your title.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.606
I think you just twisted yourself up
into a knot.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.442
I have a very bad stomach ache.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.279
Oh, Jianyu, darling,
would you like some tea?

13:45.033 --> 13:46.616
That nod meant "no," apparently.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.328
Well, it was nice to get out
and meet all of our wonderful neighbours.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.164
They all truly belong here.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.458
Mmm. Yes, they do, cutie pants!

13:54.500 --> 13:55.375
Boop!

13:55.710 --> 13:57.169
Well! I should really be going.
I have to begin

13:57.211 --> 13:59.755
my twelve-step
Korean skin care regimen but, uh...

13:59.797 --> 14:01.131
I'll see you... oh, no, no, no.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.008
Please, stay
and enjoy the evening tea.

14:03.051 --> 14:03.925
I'll see you soon.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.181
I can't even tell if you've kissed
my cheek or the air around it.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.767
Oh. Thank you. That's the goal.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.018
Boop!

14:27.742 --> 14:29.826
"The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil."

14:32.163 --> 14:33.038
Hey, man!

14:35.375 --> 14:36.249
What's wrong?

14:36.834 --> 14:37.793
Am I a good teacher?

14:38.461 --> 14:40.629
Am I... am I clear, do I make sense?

14:40.671 --> 14:43.799
Yeah, you're a great teacher!
I'm super ethical now.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.675
What's that?
- Hmm?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.552
Nah... Don't worry about it.

14:50.181 --> 14:54.559
I stole Tahani's diary so I could see
if her handwriting matches the note

14:54.602 --> 14:58.563
and also read about all the mean
and terrible things she's definitely done

14:58.606 --> 15:00.607
so I can prove she's actually evil.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.612
Huh.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.448
What do you think that means?

15:08.950 --> 15:10.450
It's tough to interpret.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.411
Feels positive though.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.959
You stole Tahani's diary?

15:19.001 --> 15:21.420
I know I broke some ethical rule
but I had good reason.

15:21.462 --> 15:25.799
Eleanor. In order to be a good person
you have to do good things.

15:26.134 --> 15:30.178
And not stealing people's stuff,
that is just a basic kindergarten rule.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.515
I mean, do I also have to tell you
to not throw sand?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.976
First of all, throwing sand
is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.018
Why would you even know that?

15:37.061 --> 15:39.354
Second of all, I know
that it may not be "nice"

15:39.397 --> 15:42.566
but neither is pretending to be
one hundred percent perfect

15:42.608 --> 15:43.775
like Tahani does.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.403
She wrote that note.
- No, she didn't!

15:46.737 --> 15:47.737
You did!

15:48.698 --> 15:51.741
I... I was hoping you would come
to this conclusion on your own

15:51.784 --> 15:56.163
but obviously, no one here
would ever threaten you.

15:56.581 --> 16:00.292
That note is the Good Place
manifesting your own guilt -

16:00.334 --> 16:05.589
like with the plant, or when you literally
made giant shrimp fly through the air.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.467
I wrote myself the note!

16:09.302 --> 16:12.304
And as it turns out I do belong here

16:12.722 --> 16:14.306
because I'm just as good as everyone else.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.934
And... and nobody is at fault for anything.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.896
Oh! You, sir, are an excellent teacher.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.231
No, no, no. You don't belong here.

16:23.274 --> 16:26.234
And in this place,
everyone is better than you.

16:26.277 --> 16:28.820
It has been proven by an infallible formula.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.658
Tahani might be a little British
and condescending at times

16:33.701 --> 16:37.662
but she devoted her entire life
to helping other people.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.583
I mean when you were with her today,
did she do anything to indicate

16:41.626 --> 16:43.627
that she might be secretly out to get you?

16:43.794 --> 16:46.338
No. Because I was there
to thwart her plan.

16:46.380 --> 16:50.675
Or because the only plan
was to comfort people.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.136
She's a good person. Accept that.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.935
Hey, babe. Great news.
I got us tickets to the Coyotes' game.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.646
Awesome!
- But, ooh, yikes.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.940
Turns out two of the players
have "DUI"s.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.359
Guess we can't cheer for that team.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.276
Eleanor...

17:08.319 --> 17:12.822
You know what? Instead, let's just stay in,
watch a Roman Polanski movie

17:12.949 --> 17:15.283
listen to R. Kelly, and eat Chik-Fil-A.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.160
Does that sound good?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.412
There's bad stuff everywhere, man.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.164
It's impossible to avoid.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.291
Yeah, but... shouldn't we just try?

17:23.334 --> 17:25.752
Shouldn't we just try to do
the right thing, whenever we can?

17:25.795 --> 17:29.172
Why? It's so much harder to live like that,
and it's not like someone's keeping score.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.883
Look, I know you're gonna break up with me.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.218
Okay? I'm not an idiot.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.719
I read your emails to your dad.

17:34.845 --> 17:35.720
Oh, my God.
- Have fun being

17:35.763 --> 17:37.264
so amazing and perfect until you die.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.433
And by the way, I'm talking really fast
because I still go to Andy's Coffee

17:40.476 --> 17:41.893
and I got a full punch card, bro!

17:49.402 --> 17:50.944
Good people make me insecure.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.155
When I'm around someone
who I think is "better" than me

17:54.198 --> 17:55.782
I try and drag them down to my level.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.578
That's why perfect Tahani
is like my kryptonite.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.372
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe Tahani

18:02.415 --> 18:05.625
has her own set of insecurities
and anxieties?

18:05.918 --> 18:06.793
Never.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.129
That woman has zero problems.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.173
Her biggest flaw is
that she makes a weird face

18:12.216 --> 18:15.844
when she sneezes and even that is
actually charming

18:16.053 --> 18:17.554
because she looks like a baby deer.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.057
The point is... you were right.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.477
About why I reacted to her the way I did.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.689
Well, maybe even admitting
that is an important step.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.025
And also, maybe don't listen to me.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.776
I would love not to listen to you.

18:32.028 --> 18:32.902
Wait, what?

18:32.945 --> 18:38.783
Basically, my life's work
is thirty-six hundred pages of garbage.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.785
Even, Michael couldn't understand it.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.871
So? What does Michael know?

18:42.913 --> 18:43.788
Everything.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.334
That's my point - he knows everything,
and it was too convoluted even for him.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.753
Michael does not know everything.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.631
Michael does not know
I'm not supposed to be here.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.008
You wrote four thousand pages

18:55.051 --> 18:58.178
on one of the most
complicated subjects in the world!

18:58.304 --> 19:01.056
I mean I used to get bored
halfway through writing a text message.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.682
Be proud!

19:08.064 --> 19:11.441
I want to broaden my horizons
and try new things and I will.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.777
But even though I might
have gotten lost in the weeds

19:13.819 --> 19:18.406
I loved writing this book,
and I want to try again.

19:18.741 --> 19:19.658
So...

19:20.534 --> 19:22.494
will you be my advisor?
- Chidi

19:22.828 --> 19:25.121
all I want is for you to be happy.

19:25.790 --> 19:30.251
So if spending eternity
getting blunt feedback on your circular

19:30.294 --> 19:35.382
rambling ideas will make you happy,
then of course I will be your advisor!

19:35.424 --> 19:39.135
Let's throw that monstrosity
in the trash and start over!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.514
Aren't there maybe some parts
worth salvaging?

19:42.765 --> 19:45.517
Honestly, man, I don't even know.
I mean that thing is unreadable.

19:45.768 --> 19:49.396
I literally learned what headaches were
because that thing gave me a headache.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.897
Okay.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.110
There you go!
New beginnings! Well done.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.968
Oh! Hello, Eleanor.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.429
Hi. Sorry, I was just cleaning up.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.431
You okay?

20:25.391 --> 20:28.143
Do you want to talk about it?

20:28.269 --> 20:29.185
Desperately.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.396
It's Jianyu.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.606
I just can't seem to connect with him.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.358
I know that he took a vow of silence

20:35.860 --> 20:38.111
but he won't even talk to me,
his soulmate!

20:39.029 --> 20:40.488
And I adore talking.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.532
I know. You do.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.868
Eleanor, you don't know
what it's like to be in paradise

20:44.910 --> 20:47.328
and feel like there's something
just not quite right.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.330
Well...

20:50.416 --> 20:54.127
I may not know exactly
what you're feeling, but I do understand.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.589
And you deserve to be happy,
because...

20:59.049 --> 21:01.968
you are an impressive, thoughtful,
and special person.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.430
Not to mention...

21:07.016 --> 21:09.017
you have a rockin' bod.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.937
I mean, Jianyu may be mute,
but he's not blind.

21:13.564 --> 21:17.776
You two belong here,
and you belong together.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.028
And, you have all of eternity

21:20.070 --> 21:22.405
so there's plenty of time
for things to change.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.909
Oh, thank you.
I really needed to hear that.

21:25.951 --> 21:26.826
Come here.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.914
Ugh! Of course your hugs
are amazing.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.383
Stupid ledge. No stairs.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.594
Hmm!

21:44.929 --> 21:46.971
Everyone here is really into hugging.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.809
Looks like someone learned something.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.858
Well... it's 'cause someone else
is a really good teacher.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.655
Eleanor! Hello.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.074
How are you, my dear, sweet "bestie?"

22:06.450 --> 22:08.243
Never better. What's up?

22:08.285 --> 22:10.620
Well, Janet has been acting
as my assistant.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.874
It... it's not what she was
designed to do. It didn't go "great."

22:14.917 --> 22:16.251
But now I'm back to normal.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.253
It turns out that the best Janet

22:18.295 --> 22:21.172
was the Janet
that was inside Janet all along.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.841
She was feeling a little lost

22:22.883 --> 22:26.511
so I gave her a self-help book
to restore her confidence.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.472
Now I'm living my truth
and creating my bliss.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.724
Yes. But anyway, um... look

22:31.767 --> 22:34.310
Michael asked me
if I would serve as his assistant

22:34.353 --> 22:37.313
but I'd quite like to focus
on my relationship with Jianyu.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.942
So, I recommended you for the job.

22:41.068 --> 22:45.321
Eleanor, you and I could work side by side

22:45.364 --> 22:48.157
to figure out what's going wrong
with this neighbourhood.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.325
Will you help me?

22:50.286 --> 22:51.494
How could I say no?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.204
Hurrah! Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

22:57.418 --> 22:58.376
What now?

23:06.886 --> 23:11.764
Relax, Eleanor.
You sent this to yourself.

23:11.807 --> 23:15.643
This is your own guilt,
manifesting itself.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.479
I've been waiting for you.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.108
Jianyu? You talk now?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.155
You sent me
these threatening notes?

23:27.197 --> 23:28.489
What the fork, man?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.949
Some Buddhist monk you are!

23:30.284 --> 23:32.410
You don't belong here. Admit it.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.582
Okay, you're right. I don't belong here.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.876
Michael made a mistake.
But I'm trying, dude.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.047
I'm really trying to be a good person,
and I think I'm changing, for the better.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.674
So just please, please don't rat me out.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.470
Don't worry. I won't.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.430
Because I'm not supposed
to be here either!

23:52.723 --> 23:55.350
I don't know how I got here,
I have no idea what's going on

23:55.392 --> 23:56.851
and I'm freaking out, homey!

23:57.144 --> 23:59.270
You gotta help me! I'm scared!

24:01.607 --> 24:02.482
What?
