"Previously on" 24.

00:14.408 --> 00:17.381
- Wayne said you wanted to see me.
- Keeler...

00:17.478 --> 00:19.719
he's bringing your
ex-husband into this debate.

00:19.814 --> 00:21.638
The S.E.C. 's investigation
into his company.

00:21.734 --> 00:24.677
Well, Ted was convicted and served
his sentence. You know that.

00:24.772 --> 00:27.556
All Ted Packard wants is money.

00:27.653 --> 00:31.141
- If we pay him off, he'll recant before this debate.
- That's blackmail.

00:31.236 --> 00:34.083
We could have the money
within the hour.

00:34.179 --> 00:36.964
- I thought you were with my dad.
- Your dad's sidelining me, Kim.

00:37.060 --> 00:41.121
- "He's making me sit out."
- Look, I know my dad can be hard,
but he will come around.

00:41.218 --> 00:44.514
- We shouldn't have told him.
- The only other option I can think of...

00:44.642 --> 00:46.562
is for us to
stop seeing each other.

00:46.657 --> 00:50.303
- Chase, what do you want?
- I wanna be able to do my job.

00:50.401 --> 00:52.543
Linda, I need your help.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.030
These guys, they will kill me
if I don't get 'em something.

00:56.127 --> 00:58.782
- Where are you?
- I'm at the mall.

00:58.877 --> 01:01.661
C.T.U. Knows the powder's not real.
Now they're going after Singer.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.251
- What do you want me to do?
- Grab him and take him to containment.

01:04.349 --> 01:06.781
- Done.
- We believe your son was infected...

01:06.876 --> 01:10.075
with the virus in Mexico earlier this morning
before he came home.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.147
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

01:13.243 --> 01:16.251
We got it, Jack. He's at Los Feliz Mall
between Vermont and Sunset.

01:16.347 --> 01:19.033
- I can land a team there in 10 minutes.
- Okay, fine.

01:19.128 --> 01:21.274
- Kyle.
- Who are you?

01:21.369 --> 01:23.898
My name's Tony Almeida.
I'm a federal agent, but I'm here to help you.

01:23.993 --> 01:27.159
- I don't believe you.
- Come with me. I'll prove it to you.

01:36.214 --> 01:38.903
We have an officer down.
Kyle Singer is not in custody.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.493
I repeat. Kyle Singer
is not in custody.

01:44.500 --> 01:48.916
The following takes place
between 4:00 p.m. And 5:00 p.m.

01:50.002 --> 01:51.891
Go straight down the ramp there.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.003
Clear the way here, please.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.801
Stand back, please.
Stand back.

01:58.899 --> 02:01.904
Jack isn't picking up.
Aren't there any other agents there?

02:02.001 --> 02:04.401
- Isn't Tony there?
- I can't get through to him either.

02:04.496 --> 02:06.320
- I'm trying Micah right now.
- "What's going on?"

02:06.415 --> 02:08.080
There's been gunshots
at the mall.

02:08.175 --> 02:11.341
- When?
- Two minutes ago. I can't get
in touch with my dad or Tony.

02:11.438 --> 02:13.166
- Micah said someone's down.
- Who?

02:13.262 --> 02:15.758
It's either Tony or Jack.
He's not sure. He's about to find out.

02:18.798 --> 02:21.356
Uh-huh. Yeah.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.115
Hold on.

02:27.211 --> 02:29.515
It's Jack.

02:29.612 --> 02:31.466
He wants to talk to you.

02:31.562 --> 02:33.418
Jack, what's going on?
Where's Tony?

02:33.515 --> 02:35.338
- He's been shot.
- How bad?

02:35.433 --> 02:38.889
He was hit in the neck. He's still alive.
They're getting him to the hospital now.

02:38.986 --> 02:40.809
Oh, God.

02:40.904 --> 02:43.560
Michelle, I know how difficult
this must be for you right now.

02:43.655 --> 02:45.800
- But you need to make a decision.
- What?

02:45.895 --> 02:47.815
With Tony down,
you're in command.

02:47.910 --> 02:51.429
If you wanna be at the hospital, you're gonna
have to hand C.T.U. Over to someone else.

02:51.525 --> 02:54.469
No one will fault you for whatever you choose,
but if you choose to stay...

02:54.565 --> 02:56.390
we need you to work
at full capacity.

02:56.485 --> 02:58.916
I understand.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.859
Michelle, I'm sorry.

03:09.795 --> 03:12.099
Is Tony all right?

03:12.194 --> 03:14.370
They don't know yet.
He was shot in the neck.

03:14.465 --> 03:17.281
Michelle, we're starting to
overload the network.

03:17.376 --> 03:20.608
When the virus threat came in we had to start
stealing cycles from the main C.P.U.

03:20.705 --> 03:23.968
- Chloe, now is not a good time.
- What are you talking about?
Are you out of your mind?

03:24.063 --> 03:26.335
- Just deal with it, okay?
- Michelle?

03:26.432 --> 03:30.335
Off-load the archived files and send them
to Division. That should free up the network.

03:30.430 --> 03:33.725
Fine. That's all
I needed to know.

03:33.853 --> 03:35.676
I have to get to the hospital.

03:35.771 --> 03:39.388
Michelle, they need you in the conference area.
The second call from Hector Salazar's people...

03:39.483 --> 03:41.757
- just came in.
- I am not in a position...

03:41.853 --> 03:43.899
- to deal with this right now.
- Who else is there?

03:43.994 --> 03:46.458
You're the ranking agent
on site.

03:51.034 --> 03:53.816
Kim, I want you to find out
what hospital they took Tony to.

03:53.913 --> 03:56.664
The second anyone knows anything,
you have them patched through to me.

03:56.761 --> 03:58.648
Okay.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.574
Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Van Nuys Dam...

04:07.701 --> 04:09.654
adjacent to
the 101 Freeway.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.374
Provide him with
a full-spectrum bandwidth radio...

04:12.471 --> 04:16.980
adjusted to frequency XQ2137.

04:17.076 --> 04:19.315
Do not attempt
aerial or ground surveillance.

04:19.411 --> 04:22.035
You have two hours
from the receipt of this message to comply.

04:22.132 --> 04:25.811
If you violate any one of these conditions,
we will release the virus.

04:25.906 --> 04:28.082
Does the encoding scheme
match the first message?

04:28.177 --> 04:31.632
- Yeah.
- Is there any way you can
find out where it came from?

04:31.730 --> 04:35.025
I can scan the frequency.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

04:35.153 --> 04:38.416
Whoever sent this message
is controlling Kyle Singer's movements.

04:38.511 --> 04:41.615
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

04:45.357 --> 04:48.141
- Kyle?
- Linda, where are you?

04:48.238 --> 04:52.109
I'm trying to park, but they're putting up
barricades. Something's going on here.

04:52.205 --> 04:55.853
No, no, don't go to the garage.
Meet me outside the, uh, east entrance, okay?

04:55.948 --> 04:58.316
- On Vermont?
- Yeah. Go there now. I'll be there in a second.

04:58.443 --> 05:01.226
- Okay.
- Antonio...

05:01.324 --> 05:04.105
I found him!

05:18.536 --> 05:20.584
I'm just gonna head back
because...

05:27.589 --> 05:29.733
Move over! Go!

05:29.829 --> 05:31.779
- Get over!
- What's going on?

05:31.876 --> 05:33.669
I don't know.

05:33.764 --> 05:36.772
- Where are we going?
- We just gotta get out of here.

05:49.025 --> 05:50.849
This is all-contact frequency.

05:50.945 --> 05:53.887
So, if he shows up anywhere,
please let me know as soon as possible.

05:53.984 --> 05:56.063
- "Okay?"
- "You got it."

05:56.159 --> 05:58.047
Excuse me.

06:03.582 --> 06:05.404
What's up?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.453
- I just heard about Tony.
- Yeah?

06:07.549 --> 06:10.172
- How's he doing?
- He's on his way to the hospital.

06:15.898 --> 06:17.722
Why isn't Michelle with him?

06:17.817 --> 06:20.539
She knows it's gonna set us back
if she and Tony are both gone.

06:22.458 --> 06:25.687
- Tell Michelle I'm heading over to Downey.
- You're going to see Salazar?

06:25.783 --> 06:28.665
- Yeah.
- My dad said questioning him is a waste of time.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.937
No, sitting around here
is a waste of time.

06:31.032 --> 06:33.591
Don't you think you should
clear it with Michelle first?

06:33.687 --> 06:37.334
We lost the kid who's infected with the virus.
If anyone knows where he's going, it's Salazar.

06:37.429 --> 06:39.637
At least run it by her
before you go.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.430
I'll call her from Downey.

06:41.525 --> 06:43.413
Chase.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.644
- Dessler.
- I'm looking for Tony Almeida's wife.

06:50.739 --> 06:52.564
Yes, this is Michelle.

06:52.660 --> 06:55.476
- Michelle, this is Dr. Linzer
at Good Samaritan Hospital.
- How is he?

06:55.571 --> 06:59.665
I'm afraid the wound to your husband's neck
is going to require some vascular repair.

06:59.762 --> 07:02.034
We're just about to
go into surgery.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.592
- Well, can... can I talk to him?
- No. We've medicated him.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.512
In fact, that's why
I'm calling you.

07:06.608 --> 07:08.272
We need your verbal consent
to operate.

07:08.369 --> 07:11.503
Yeah, yes, yes. Uh, of course.
Whatever you have to do.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.670
- Great. Thanks.
- Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

07:14.767 --> 07:18.381
Well, we can't say anything
with 100% certainty until we get in there...

07:18.477 --> 07:20.364
but he's gonna be
in good hands.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.637
Please let me know
the second you finish.

07:22.733 --> 07:25.229
I'll find you in the waiting room
when we're out of surgery.

07:25.326 --> 07:28.491
Dr. Linzer, I will do my best
to be there, but...

07:28.586 --> 07:30.603
you may have to
reach me through this number.

07:30.699 --> 07:32.908
Okay, we'll find you.

07:33.962 --> 07:35.914
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

08:05.603 --> 08:08.674
Uh, just clear that sight line there. How's that?

08:08.770 --> 08:10.595
I just spoke with
Anne's ex-husband.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.769
I'm meeting him
in half an hour.

08:15.650 --> 08:17.507
Unless you're
changing your mind?

08:20.961 --> 08:23.136
I've never given in to
blackmail in my life.

08:23.233 --> 08:26.816
Yes, but considering everything
that you're up against today, we decided...

08:26.913 --> 08:28.606
I decided, Wayne.

08:30.591 --> 08:32.447
It's my choice.

08:32.542 --> 08:34.462
Then, David,
you're making the right one.

08:34.558 --> 08:37.724
Give this guy some money,
he crawls back under his rock...

08:37.822 --> 08:39.869
and life will be
a lot simpler for everyone.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.484
Including Anne.

08:47.164 --> 08:48.987
I hope so.

08:52.537 --> 08:55.418
- Yes.
- I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir.

08:55.512 --> 08:58.457
- Put him through.
- The president's on the line, Mr. Bauer.

08:58.552 --> 09:01.015
- Thank you.
- Mr. President, this is Jack Bauer.

09:01.112 --> 09:04.856
Hello, Jack. I was told
that Hector Salazar has given your office...

09:04.953 --> 09:06.807
final instructions
on delivering his brother.

09:06.903 --> 09:08.727
- Yes, sir.
- I've also been told...

09:08.824 --> 09:11.798
that you might be able
to preempt that demand.

09:11.895 --> 09:14.100
We identified the person
carrying the virus.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.500
It was a young man
named Kyle Singer.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.486
- Then you know where he is?
- No, sir.

09:18.581 --> 09:20.882
Unfortunately, we lost him.

09:20.979 --> 09:22.835
Can you find him?

09:22.930 --> 09:26.227
Not in the time frame that Hector Salazar
has given us to release his brother.

09:26.322 --> 09:29.426
So either I hand over Ramon Salazar...

09:29.523 --> 09:31.730
or risk that his brother
will release the virus.

09:31.825 --> 09:35.408
Mr. President, I understand
that this is an impossible choice.

09:36.815 --> 09:39.056
It's not a choice, Jack.
Not really.

09:39.153 --> 09:42.224
This nation's policy
of nonnegotiation with terrorists...

09:42.319 --> 09:44.207
has been a proven deterrent.

09:44.303 --> 09:47.311
Capitulating to Salazar
would effectively destroy that policy.

09:47.406 --> 09:50.990
Mr. President, hundreds of thousands
of innocent people may die within the week.

09:51.085 --> 09:53.548
More would die in the long run
if I release Salazar.

09:53.644 --> 09:56.749
I would be declaring open season
on the American people.

09:56.844 --> 09:58.508
This is your final answer, sir?

09:58.604 --> 10:00.811
I don't negotiate
with terrorists, Jack.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.227
I "won't" negotiate
with terrorists.

10:05.323 --> 10:07.657
I understand, Mr. President.
Thank you.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.482
Conference in C.D.C.
And Health Services.

10:13.577 --> 10:16.745
I want a full briefing on quarantine
and evacuation procedures.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.425
Yes, Mr. President.

10:31.011 --> 10:33.381
- Can you just tell me where we're going?
- I don't know.

10:33.476 --> 10:36.644
I just gotta get out of town for a second
and figure this whole thing out.

10:36.739 --> 10:39.236
I thought you had to meet those guys.
That's why I brought the money.

10:39.331 --> 10:42.466
- Things have changed, all right?
- What are you into, Kyle?

10:42.563 --> 10:44.705
You ask me to steal
this money from my father...

10:44.802 --> 10:46.914
so these guys won't hurt you
over losing their drugs.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.058
I don't think it was drugs.

10:49.153 --> 10:51.266
- What do you mean? What is it about?
- "I don't know."

10:51.362 --> 10:53.503
These cops, they came
to my apartment today...

10:53.600 --> 10:55.583
and they were saying
something about...

10:55.679 --> 10:58.591
using me to...
to bring some weird disease into the country.

10:58.687 --> 11:00.511
- A disease?
- Yeah.

11:00.606 --> 11:04.254
This cop, he was... he was saying
that it was inside of me.

11:05.310 --> 11:07.198
In your body?

11:07.294 --> 11:10.044
I know.
It sounds ridiculous, right?

11:11.806 --> 11:14.332
Right?

11:16.026 --> 11:18.619
I mean, this whole thing
is so surreal, Linda.

11:18.715 --> 11:21.562
- Pull over.
- What?

11:22.713 --> 11:24.537
- I said pull over!
- What are you doing?

11:24.632 --> 11:26.297
What are you doing?

11:26.392 --> 11:28.217
Take the car.
Take the money.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.712
- Whatever you're doing, I don't want any part of it.
- Linda.

11:30.841 --> 11:32.919
- Linda, chill out! Chill out.
- "Stay away from me."

11:33.014 --> 11:36.312
If you've got some disease, I don't want it!
You should have never done any of this.

11:36.439 --> 11:39.095
- Don't you think I know that?
- Kyle, please.

11:39.190 --> 11:41.623
All right, fine.
Fine, baby. You're right.

11:41.718 --> 11:43.541
You're right.
I'll stay away, okay?

11:43.636 --> 11:45.526
The money's under
the front seat.

11:46.548 --> 11:48.917
Okay, look.
Come on, Linda. Please.

11:49.045 --> 11:52.470
I really don't want anything to happen to you.
I really don't, but I can't do this!

11:52.565 --> 11:54.450
How stupid am I?

11:55.987 --> 11:58.354
I'm sorry.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.257
- Go! Run! Run, Linda!
- "Kyle!"

12:02.354 --> 12:04.817
Go! No, I have it, okay?
I have it!

12:04.912 --> 12:07.633
Stop! Kyle! No!

12:07.728 --> 12:09.903
No! Stop! No!

12:12.431 --> 12:14.607
Kyle!

12:14.703 --> 12:18.062
Sir, we have a monitoring plan
for everyone inside the quarantine zone.

12:18.158 --> 12:19.982
Define the quarantine zone.

12:20.078 --> 12:22.575
Everyone within a two-mile radius
of ground zero.

12:22.670 --> 12:26.413
Ground zero being the shopping center
where Kyle Singer was last seen.

12:26.508 --> 12:29.452
Mr. President, this is Dr. Nicole Duncan
with Health Services.

12:29.548 --> 12:32.812
Medical teams are in place and ready
to start screening and releasing people...

12:32.907 --> 12:35.082
from quarantine over a 72-hour period.

12:35.177 --> 12:39.179
If we move quickly, we believe
we can lower the prior casualty estimate.

12:39.274 --> 12:41.896
- Lower it to what?
- Between 60,000 and 90,000.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.009
This is Wayne Palmer.

12:44.104 --> 12:47.048
- "Yeah, yeah."
- All right. Thank you, Ms. Dessler...

12:47.145 --> 12:49.384
- Dr. Duncan.
- Mr. President.

12:51.176 --> 12:53.448
We're about to set into motion
a chain of events...

12:53.543 --> 12:55.398
that will create panic
throughout the country...

12:55.494 --> 12:57.319
that will take
some time to control.

12:57.414 --> 13:01.572
If anyone here sees an option
that I'm overlooking...

13:01.669 --> 13:03.493
now's the time
to offer it up.

13:03.588 --> 13:05.540
It's Jack Bauer.

13:05.635 --> 13:09.252
He needs to talk to you in private,
and he says it's urgent.

13:09.347 --> 13:11.234
Would you all
excuse me for a moment?

13:11.330 --> 13:15.201
In the meantime,
I want everyone to contact their key personnel...

13:15.299 --> 13:17.282
make sure they're ready to go.

13:22.785 --> 13:24.610
What is it, Jack?

13:24.706 --> 13:27.071
Mr. President,
is this line secure?

13:27.168 --> 13:29.311
Yes. What do you need
to tell me, Jack?

13:30.303 --> 13:32.127
For what it's worth, sir...

13:32.222 --> 13:35.740
I agree with you supporting this country's policy
to not negotiate with terrorists.

13:35.837 --> 13:38.365
Jack, you didn't call me
to express your approval of my decision.

13:38.461 --> 13:40.286
I have another option
for you to consider.

13:40.381 --> 13:42.267
- Another option?
- Yes. One that I believe...

13:42.364 --> 13:45.084
will protect the integrity
of this nation's policy...

13:45.181 --> 13:47.068
and stop this outbreak
from beginning.

13:47.163 --> 13:49.755
- And how would I do this?
- By simply doing nothing, sir.

13:49.850 --> 13:52.634
- Nothing?
- Yes, Mr. President.

13:52.731 --> 13:55.130
Hector Salazar will view that
as noncompliance with his demands.

13:55.259 --> 13:57.881
- Not if he gets his brother back.
- How?

13:57.976 --> 14:00.984
Ramon Salazar would be
broken out of prison and delivered to him.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.543
The public, and more importantly,
other terrorist groups...

14:03.641 --> 14:05.464
would view this
as a prison break...

14:05.560 --> 14:07.830
as opposed to a capitulation
to their terrorist demands.

14:07.927 --> 14:10.902
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack.
But who'll break Salazar out?

14:12.055 --> 14:14.038
- I will, sir.
- By yourself?

14:14.133 --> 14:15.956
I know the prison.
I have access to the prisoner.

14:16.053 --> 14:18.101
Because of the nature of my involvement
with the Salazars...

14:18.197 --> 14:20.019
I could break him out
and deliver him.

14:20.115 --> 14:22.708
I have a history of insubordination with C.T.U.
They would believe I switched sides.

14:22.804 --> 14:24.627
The cover story
would stay clean.

14:24.724 --> 14:26.547
This doesn't sound like
a one-man job.

14:26.642 --> 14:29.745
In order to protect you,
Mr. President, it has to be.

14:29.841 --> 14:32.946
I don't know, Jack.
There has to be some other way.

14:33.042 --> 14:35.282
No, no. Not in the time
that we've got left.

14:35.377 --> 14:38.032
The Salazars are gonna release the virus
within the next two hours.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.848
Regardless of how successful you are
at containing the initial outbreak...

14:40.943 --> 14:43.023
the resulting civil unrest
would far outreach...

14:43.120 --> 14:45.391
any quarantine zones
you've established.

14:45.487 --> 14:47.854
The damage to this country,
sir, would be catastrophic.

14:50.254 --> 14:52.078
Mr. President,

14:52.173 --> 14:54.413
I need your okay on this.

14:57.068 --> 15:00.363
Even if you succeed,
I won't be able to correct your legal status.

15:00.459 --> 15:02.540
You'll be a fugitive.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.283
I understand, Mr. President.
This would be my last assignment.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.458
I don't know what to say.

15:08.553 --> 15:12.809
If you don't say anything, Mr. President,
I will accept that as a go for this mission.

15:22.215 --> 15:24.678
Good luck,
Mr. President.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.130
I want the information from Dr. Duncan
sent directly to my office.

15:48.225 --> 15:50.050
- Any clearance?
- My eyes only.

15:50.146 --> 15:53.441
- Got it.
- "That's good. I'll give you a call."

15:57.888 --> 15:59.871
Wayne, where are you going?

15:59.967 --> 16:01.790
- Excuse me.
- Wait.

16:01.886 --> 16:05.566
I'm sorry, Anne, but, um, I have an appointment,
and I'm... I'm running late.

16:05.661 --> 16:07.614
An appointment?
The debate starts in 30 minutes.

16:07.709 --> 16:11.486
- Who are you meeting?
- Um, I'm sorry again, but that's confidential.

16:11.581 --> 16:15.323
- It's government business.
- Does this have anything to do
with my ex-husband?

16:18.012 --> 16:19.899
Like I said...

16:20.028 --> 16:21.852
it's government business.

16:39.096 --> 16:42.104
Surgery. Nurses' station.

16:42.199 --> 16:44.023
Yeah, this is Tony Almeida's
wife, Michelle.

16:44.118 --> 16:46.740
- I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery yet.
- Yes, he has.

16:46.837 --> 16:50.804
Um, I just wanted Dr. Linzer to know
that he's allergic to penicillin.

16:50.901 --> 16:53.235
Yes, he's aware.
The allergy card was in his wallet.

16:53.331 --> 16:55.378
Is there any way to know
how he's doing in there?

16:55.476 --> 16:58.611
No, but the doctor will contact you
as soon as he's out of surgery.

16:58.708 --> 17:00.595
Okay, thank you.

17:00.723 --> 17:02.546
You're welcome.

17:03.537 --> 17:05.137
Yeah?

17:05.233 --> 17:08.816
- Uh, the site profiles are done.
- "You could have sent these to my system."

17:08.913 --> 17:11.855
Yeah, I know. I wanted to
come down here anyway.

17:11.953 --> 17:14.096
- Why?
- Because of earlier.

17:14.191 --> 17:17.230
- What is it, Chloe?
- I-I just want you to know...

17:17.326 --> 17:20.717
that I didn't know that Tony had been shot
in the neck when I was insensitive earlier.

17:20.814 --> 17:24.589
And had I known, I certainly would have been
more careful about my choice of words, okay?

17:24.685 --> 17:27.916
- It's fine, Chloe.
- I do try to be aware of other people.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.346
- You know that, don't you?
- I said it's fine.

17:30.444 --> 17:33.132
Okay.

17:38.027 --> 17:39.851
- Gael.
- What?

17:39.946 --> 17:42.600
I think we should be careful
about how we talk to Michelle today.

17:42.698 --> 17:45.545
She's really sensitive...
about Tony being shot in the neck.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.785
- Of course.
- So I'm telling everybody.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.409
Make sure everyone in your department knows.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.551
- I've gotta take this call.
- Is that a personal cell?

17:52.647 --> 17:55.591
I thought those were prohibited
because they can't be monitored.

17:55.686 --> 17:58.662
I'm using it for interagency. I'm moving around
a lot. They'll monitor on the other end.

17:58.758 --> 18:01.349
I've really gotta take this call.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.660
- Hello.
- When did you make the second call?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.858
- Twenty minutes ago.
- Are they letting Ramon go or not?

18:13.956 --> 18:15.970
- They're still deciding.
- What are they waiting for?

18:16.067 --> 18:17.922
They have less than
two hours.

18:18.017 --> 18:20.641
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear anything.

18:51.867 --> 18:54.043
I'm sorry.

18:54.139 --> 18:56.089
It's not good to touch
what's not yours.

18:56.185 --> 18:58.586
Does your sister know
you are here?

18:58.713 --> 19:01.176
No.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.321
Did you know it was loaded?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.725
It is a nice gun, huh?

19:18.742 --> 19:21.588
Take it, Sergio.
It's okay.

19:25.556 --> 19:28.754
Ahh. Uh-huh?

19:28.851 --> 19:31.508
You like the way
it feels? Huh?

19:34.993 --> 19:36.881
Want to pull the trigger?

19:36.978 --> 19:39.121
Hear the noise it makes?

19:39.216 --> 19:40.945
Huh?

19:41.040 --> 19:44.336
That's what power
feels like, Sergio.

19:44.463 --> 19:46.351
It feels like a gun.

19:48.335 --> 19:50.221
Can I?

19:52.046 --> 19:55.565
Sure. Sure.
Come on.

19:59.501 --> 20:01.388
Do you see that vase
down there?

20:01.515 --> 20:04.362
Okay, now I want you to aim...

20:04.491 --> 20:08.266
and squeeze the trigger
very slowly.

20:10.922 --> 20:13.066
- "Muy bueno."
- Yes!

20:13.161 --> 20:15.816
What are you doing?

20:15.913 --> 20:17.897
Get out of here!
Go! Now!

20:20.361 --> 20:23.689
How many times do I have to tell you
to leave him alone? He's just a boy.

20:23.817 --> 20:26.631
- A boy who needs to become a man.
- Well, you're not his father.

20:31.591 --> 20:33.479
What you gonna do, huh?

20:33.574 --> 20:35.397
You gonna shoot me?

20:35.493 --> 20:37.380
Hmm?

20:39.044 --> 20:40.869
Come on.

20:40.964 --> 20:43.363
Pull the trigger.
Right here. Come on.

20:54.370 --> 20:56.256
Get in there.

21:07.230 --> 21:09.404
Hey, what is this?

21:10.974 --> 21:12.861
What are you gonna do to us?

21:17.724 --> 21:19.548
No!

21:19.643 --> 21:21.819
What is this?
What are you gonna do to us?

21:56.658 --> 21:58.548
Come.

22:00.371 --> 22:03.217
We never really finished our conversation.

22:03.345 --> 22:05.170
I was just wondering
what you had decided.

22:05.265 --> 22:08.496
- Decided about what?
- The debate.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.481
What to do about my ex-husband.

22:13.137 --> 22:15.121
I ran into Wayne
a few minutes ago.

22:15.216 --> 22:18.255
I know he's never liked me,
but this was different.

22:18.350 --> 22:20.239
He was avoiding me, and...

22:21.614 --> 22:24.558
I had a feeling
I wasn't able to shake.

22:24.653 --> 22:26.510
What kind of feeling?

22:26.606 --> 22:29.517
That you're paying Ted
to keep quiet.

22:33.899 --> 22:35.756
Is that what
you're doing, David?

22:37.354 --> 22:40.170
Sometimes you have to do the wrong thing
for the right reason.

22:40.267 --> 22:44.266
How can you reward someone
for threatening you with a lie? It's wrong.

22:44.362 --> 22:48.135
There are political realities
I have to consider if I want to stay in office.

22:48.264 --> 22:51.463
- Tell yourself that if it makes you feel better...
- It doesn't make me feel better.

22:51.561 --> 22:53.800
Just happens to be the truth.

22:57.989 --> 23:01.893
Anne, I have been in this job
for nearly four years...

23:01.990 --> 23:04.038
and I have learned
the hard way...

23:04.133 --> 23:05.957
that there are no absolutes.

23:06.054 --> 23:07.877
Sometimes you have to
make compromises.

23:07.972 --> 23:09.796
Politically, yes.

23:09.891 --> 23:13.539
But when it comes to morality...
David, you have to draw the line.

23:13.636 --> 23:16.931
I have drawn the line.
We're just standing on different sides.

23:21.379 --> 23:24.226
- You're running scared.
- I'm fighting to stay in office...

23:24.353 --> 23:26.656
and serve the people
that put me here.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.575
Then face Keeler's lie
with the truth...

23:28.671 --> 23:31.903
and trust that the people
will be able to tell the difference.

23:32.001 --> 23:33.888
It's not that easy.

23:34.015 --> 23:35.838
You've never been about
what's easy.

23:35.935 --> 23:37.759
You've been about what's right.

23:37.855 --> 23:40.093
That's... who you are.

23:40.189 --> 23:42.877
That's who the people
elected to lead them.

23:45.981 --> 23:47.932
For what it's worth...

23:49.051 --> 23:50.939
that's who I fell in love with.

23:54.748 --> 23:56.571
I was...

24:00.185 --> 24:03.000
- I was trying to protect you.
- Protect "me?"

24:03.097 --> 24:05.209
This won't end
with Keeler's allegation.

24:05.304 --> 24:07.385
You're gonna be
in the media's crosshairs.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.975
- I'm used to public scrutiny.
- Not like this.

24:10.072 --> 24:13.335
This will be different
and much uglier than you can imagine.

24:13.430 --> 24:16.183
I can defend myself.

24:40.977 --> 24:43.248
- David.
- Have you made contact with Packard?

24:43.343 --> 24:45.520
He just got here.

24:45.615 --> 24:48.240
- Are you with him now?
- No, he's coming over now. Why?

24:49.552 --> 24:51.406
Walk away.

24:51.501 --> 24:53.103
What?

24:53.199 --> 24:55.694
- You heard me.
- David, we've been through this.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.612
You decided to bury
this thing, remember?

24:57.710 --> 24:59.374
I've changed my mind.

24:59.469 --> 25:02.285
- Anne talked to you, didn't she?
- Wayne...

25:02.380 --> 25:04.684
walk away.

25:41.029 --> 25:44.227
- You wanted to see me?
- "I've spoken to Chloe and Adam..."

25:44.322 --> 25:46.883
and we'll cover for you
if you wanna go to the hospital.

25:46.978 --> 25:50.402
- Cover for me?
- Well, we know you've got
a lot on your mind right now.

25:50.499 --> 25:52.322
- I'm fine, Gael.
- We just thought that...

25:52.417 --> 25:56.513
Look, Michelle, I've been taking 30%
of Chloe's load since the bio-threat came in.

25:56.610 --> 25:58.431
I can handle half
of Comm's load as well.

25:58.528 --> 26:00.768
We'll just need to route user password
on District servers...

26:00.864 --> 26:03.263
so we won't be slowed down
by request authorizations.

26:03.392 --> 26:06.047
It's Joe Thomas Alazaria.
He put a 24-hour delay on user mods...

26:06.142 --> 26:08.030
because of security problems
we've been having.

26:08.127 --> 26:11.423
- What if I call Joe and get him to wave those?
- I tried that. He's unreachable.

26:11.518 --> 26:13.532
Is there any other way
to do this?

26:13.629 --> 26:15.964
More bodies. We need at least
four more system-ready analysts...

26:16.061 --> 26:17.885
to take on the work
we've been doing.

26:17.980 --> 26:20.349
I can make some calls,
get the next shift in early.

26:20.444 --> 26:23.867
I've already tried that.
By the time they got here, it would be too late.

26:23.963 --> 26:26.426
Look, I appreciate this,
but it's not gonna happen.

26:27.995 --> 26:29.625
So let's get back to work.

26:33.081 --> 26:35.353
Michelle.

26:38.488 --> 26:41.496
Listen, I agree.
We can't run this place by committee.

26:41.591 --> 26:44.918
- Let me step in for you.
Adam and Chloe can stay at their posts.
- What about yours?

26:45.045 --> 26:49.270
While I was at Langley, I filled in for my bureau
chief a couple of times and we got through it.

26:49.364 --> 26:52.663
Was there a bio-threat?
The president in town all in one day?

26:53.716 --> 26:55.605
Thank you anyway, Gael.

27:03.538 --> 27:06.418
- C.T.U., Bauer.
- Kim, it's your dad. What are you doing right now?

27:06.545 --> 27:10.065
I'm still trying to locate a point of origin
on that phone call from Salazar's people.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.360
Okay, I'm gonna need you to do something
for me first. It's not gonna take long.

27:13.456 --> 27:16.911
- What?
- I need you to generate
a prisoner transfer document.

27:17.008 --> 27:20.463
Look into your file form under the heading
Federal Transit Authorization.

27:20.559 --> 27:22.383
What's this about?

27:22.478 --> 27:26.254
- I need to move Ramon Salazar.
- Why are you gonna move him?

27:26.381 --> 27:29.965
Kim, this has been given priority clearance.
No one at C.T.U. Is supposed to know.

27:30.060 --> 27:33.166
That's why you're the only person
I can trust to do this. So please help.

27:34.508 --> 27:36.685
Okay, it's asking
for a clearance code.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.923
Hit star nine, nine.

27:39.916 --> 27:41.803
Now it wants a password.

27:41.899 --> 27:44.137
Lincoln, six, five, F-G-A.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.657
Okay, it's cycling.

27:51.752 --> 27:54.089
- It's gonna take a minute.
- Okay, good.

27:55.688 --> 27:59.336
Look, Kim, I know you tried to come up
to my office earlier today...

27:59.431 --> 28:02.182
and talk to me about something
that was really important to you.

28:02.278 --> 28:04.644
I know I wasn't very supportive,
and I just wanted to...

28:04.741 --> 28:07.142
- You don't have to do this, Dad.
- Sweetheart, I do.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.381
I need to tell you
I'm sorry.

28:10.916 --> 28:13.093
I know that I'm
overly protective of you.

28:13.188 --> 28:16.418
I've just watched so many things
happen to you over the last few years, l...

28:16.515 --> 28:19.714
I don't want you to
get hurt anymore.

28:19.811 --> 28:23.746
The fact is that I trust you.
I trust your judgment.

28:23.841 --> 28:28.225
I need you to know that anything that you ever
chose to do I would support you in.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.689
- Okay?
- Thanks. That means a lot to me.

28:33.152 --> 28:35.294
Good.

28:35.390 --> 28:37.279
I love you so much, Kim.

28:37.408 --> 28:39.710
I love you too, Dad.

28:42.781 --> 28:45.629
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.771
Look, is the document up yet?

28:47.869 --> 28:49.917
- Yeah.
- I need you to send it to Warden Mitchell...

28:50.012 --> 28:51.901
over at Downey now.

28:51.996 --> 28:55.514
- Done.
- Okay, good. Let me speak to Chase.

28:57.019 --> 28:59.483
- He's not here.
- What are you talking about? Where is he?

28:59.578 --> 29:01.881
Kim?

29:01.978 --> 29:03.833
Kim, where is Chase?

29:03.929 --> 29:06.616
He went to interrogate Salazar.

29:06.712 --> 29:10.007
- Chase is at the prison now?
- He left about 15 minutes ago.

29:10.104 --> 29:14.039
- He's gonna be there soon.
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

29:14.135 --> 29:15.957
Son of a bitch!

29:22.933 --> 29:25.589
- Yeah.
- Chase, what are you doing?

29:25.685 --> 29:28.499
- Goin' to talk to Salazar.
- Get back to C.T.U. Now!

29:28.596 --> 29:30.931
And do what?
Some filing, some dusting around the office?

29:31.028 --> 29:33.586
No, I want you to work with Michelle
and find Kyle Singer.

29:33.682 --> 29:35.827
She's got a dozen I.T. People
on that right now.

29:35.924 --> 29:38.482
- Listen to me.
- No, listen to me, Jack.

29:38.578 --> 29:40.689
I know you're angry
about me and Kim. I get that.

29:40.786 --> 29:45.329
- But I'm not gonna let you
stop me from doing my job.
- Your job is to follow my orders!

29:45.424 --> 29:47.918
You're in no condition
to give me orders.

29:48.015 --> 29:51.790
Chase, I'm warning you.
Don't go against me.

29:51.888 --> 29:53.903
Jack, look,
you know I respect you.

29:53.998 --> 29:55.822
But you also know
I've been covering for you.

29:55.917 --> 29:58.765
Since you've been back,
I've been keeping the fact that you're a junkie...

29:58.893 --> 30:00.717
from Kim and everybody else
at C.T.U.

30:00.812 --> 30:03.533
- I'm not doing it anymore. I'm done.
- Chase, listen to me. Chase.

30:03.629 --> 30:06.029
Chase! Damn it!

30:09.516 --> 30:12.426
- Get this guy processed and get him out of here.
- " Yes, sir."

30:14.090 --> 30:16.330
- Agent Edmunds.
- Warden...

30:16.427 --> 30:18.250
I need to see Salazar.

30:18.345 --> 30:20.169
I've got a lot
going on right now.

30:20.265 --> 30:23.369
I'll have Division follow up with written
authorization, but you need to let me see Salazar.

30:23.464 --> 30:26.825
Salazar's been behind two murders today.
No one gets close without full paperwork.

30:26.952 --> 30:28.871
You don't understand
what's happening today.

30:28.998 --> 30:30.886
Now, Salazar has information
that I need.

30:30.982 --> 30:32.807
- What kind of information?
- It's classified.

30:32.902 --> 30:35.430
This is my facility.
I need to know.

30:36.613 --> 30:38.501
We're dealing with a major
terrorist threat.

30:38.597 --> 30:40.966
Now, Salazar's brother's
behind it.

30:41.061 --> 30:43.429
Go ahead and confirm it
with Division if you want to...

30:43.556 --> 30:45.956
but hundreds of thousands
of lives are at stake here.

30:46.084 --> 30:49.505
Now, Jack and I have been coming here
twice a week for the last three months.

30:49.602 --> 30:51.618
Salazar's prevented us
from doing our job with his stalling

30:51.713 --> 30:53.537
and his lawyers
and his due process.

30:53.635 --> 30:56.225
We don't have time for that.

30:56.323 --> 30:59.264
I need to go one-on-one
with him right now.

31:01.952 --> 31:03.872
He's in an isolation cell
on "B" Block.

31:03.999 --> 31:06.112
- Come on. I'll take you.
- Thank you.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.805
- Surveillance cameras?
- There are three.

31:15.934 --> 31:18.494
- I need 'em turned off.
- It's against regulations.

31:18.590 --> 31:20.220
There won't be any marks.
I promise.

31:21.453 --> 31:22.619
You've got 30 minutes.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.042
- This is Warden Mitchell.
- Yes, sir.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.114
- I need you to go black on isolation "B."
- For how long, sir?

31:33.210 --> 31:35.098
- Till further notice.
- "Yes, sir."

31:51.542 --> 31:54.197
You're a tough guy, huh?

31:56.213 --> 31:59.251
You are not worried what may happen
if you lay a finger on me?

32:00.466 --> 32:04.243
Okay, if you're not worried,
neither am I.

32:09.523 --> 32:11.633
Let me know
when you start to worry.

32:28.910 --> 32:31.724
- Where's Kyle Singer? Hmm?
- I told you. I don't know.

32:31.821 --> 32:33.964
You're gonna tell me
who does.

32:34.061 --> 32:37.356
" Chase."

32:37.483 --> 32:40.204
Put him in his cell.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.571
Ow!

32:45.899 --> 32:48.329
- What are you doing here, Jack?
- We ran out of options.

32:48.458 --> 32:51.944
We can't find Singer.
Salazar's our only hope. You were right.

32:52.041 --> 32:54.792
- He's tougher to break than
I thought. Maybe the two of us...
- Yeah.

32:54.887 --> 32:57.288
Look, Jack,
about what I said before...

32:58.695 --> 33:00.583
Forget about it.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.622
So we're okay, you and me?

33:06.567 --> 33:08.933
Yeah, we're okay.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.716
- Tell me about the security cameras.
- They're disabled.

33:11.812 --> 33:13.829
Good.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.972
Get him out of his cell.

33:35.167 --> 33:36.864
Are you gonna
kill me now, Jack?

33:39.711 --> 33:41.982
I'd love to.
But I can't.

33:42.077 --> 33:45.438
If you play this cool, Ramon,
you're walking out of here with me now.

33:45.565 --> 33:49.725
You'll be with your brother in the next
couple of hours. Now grab his feet.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.185
Turn and face the wall.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.996
How you gonna feel, Anne...

34:27.092 --> 34:29.621
if David loses this election
because of you?

34:31.315 --> 34:33.554
I don't think
that's very likely.

34:33.650 --> 34:37.812
Hmm. Then you really don't know
what you're talking about, do you?

34:37.907 --> 34:40.400
Because this allegation
may cost him this debate.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.761
- And David needs this debate to win this election.
- It was blackmail.

34:43.856 --> 34:47.856
And David made a decision to pay.
It wasn't up to you to change his mind.

34:47.951 --> 34:51.887
If he believed the decision was right,
he wouldn't have changed his mind.

34:51.984 --> 34:54.607
The problem is...

34:54.702 --> 34:57.486
you can't stand the fact
that your brother wants me in his life.

34:57.582 --> 34:59.406
Because you're
a distraction, Anne.

34:59.502 --> 35:01.390
And you're a liability.

35:01.485 --> 35:04.012
Compared to whom? Sherry?

35:04.107 --> 35:07.404
I'm not gonna sit here and try and defend Sherry.
She went off the rails.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.836
But at least she understood the game,
and she understood David.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.755
She was with him
for over 20 years.

35:11.851 --> 35:14.506
I have been with him long enough
to know the kind of man he is.

35:14.603 --> 35:17.068
You don't know anything
about him...

35:17.163 --> 35:19.530
or what it takes to survive
in the world he lives in.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.680
We disagree, Wayne.
We always have.

35:24.775 --> 35:27.815
Anne,
I will not stand by...

35:27.912 --> 35:30.569
and watch you jeopardize
everything that he's worked for.

35:30.664 --> 35:32.551
I won't do it.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.598
I don't scare easily.

36:05.375 --> 36:08.001
What's happening, Jack?
After all you went through to put me here...

36:08.096 --> 36:10.464
- I can't believe you'll let me out.
- Shut up.

36:10.591 --> 36:13.086
I don't believe you sold out.
It's not your nature.

36:13.182 --> 36:15.837
But then,
why knock out the kid?

36:15.932 --> 36:18.334
Did your government cave
but can't admit it?

36:18.463 --> 36:20.733
Is that what happened?

36:22.044 --> 36:24.892
You don't look so good, Jack.
That's a bitch.

36:24.989 --> 36:26.875
You wanna get out of here?

36:26.970 --> 36:30.234
You keep your mouth shut and do what I say.
Do you understand me?

36:31.674 --> 36:33.946
We've been cleared to pass.

36:34.042 --> 36:36.921
The warden wants to see you first.
Be here in a minute.

36:37.049 --> 36:38.937
Okay.

36:55.574 --> 36:58.357
Don't you move.

36:58.452 --> 37:01.139
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack.
- What's the problem?

37:01.236 --> 37:03.155
The access codes
for this transfer order.

37:03.284 --> 37:05.651
They don't correspond to the ones assigned
by the Bureau of Prisons.

37:05.780 --> 37:07.602
Division superseded
those access codes.

37:07.698 --> 37:10.545
- C.T.U. Has a mandated prefix.
- This is yesterday's prefix.

37:10.643 --> 37:12.467
Son of a bitch.

37:12.562 --> 37:14.864
Someone in my office
must have screwed up.

37:14.962 --> 37:16.976
We'll get you
the proper prefix retroactively.

37:18.704 --> 37:21.488
Look, I know about the terrorist threat.
Agent Edmunds told me.

37:23.056 --> 37:25.455
That's exactly why we need
to move the prisoner now.

37:25.583 --> 37:28.206
It's classified priority one.
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

37:28.301 --> 37:31.405
But I can't afford to lose any time
over some small technical detail.

37:31.502 --> 37:33.645
Come on, Kevin.
Help me out.

37:33.741 --> 37:36.813
- Where's Agent Edmunds?
- He's conducting a search of the prisoner's cell...

37:36.909 --> 37:39.308
trying to find
some additional information.

37:39.437 --> 37:42.284
He'll be right behind me.
He can help you out with the paperwork.

37:42.380 --> 37:45.451
All right, pick up your badge
and gun at receiving.

37:45.546 --> 37:47.434
Thanks. I owe ya.

37:54.249 --> 37:56.137
Move.

38:12.421 --> 38:14.916
Turn on isolation three, please.

38:20.644 --> 38:22.851
What the hell?

38:22.946 --> 38:26.467
Someone turned the camera. The angle's wrong.
Get Benjamin to meet me in isolation.

38:28.449 --> 38:30.272
- "Benjamin, we need you in isolation."
- Door.

38:41.247 --> 38:43.135
Face the wall.

38:46.076 --> 38:49.629
Agent Bauer.
Here to get my gun and my badge.

39:08.121 --> 39:10.007
Open it.

39:14.617 --> 39:17.048
Door!

39:19.574 --> 39:22.359
- Kind of hot today.
- "Yeah, buddy."

39:24.406 --> 39:28.436
Whatever Bauer told you,
he's lying! Come on!

39:28.534 --> 39:32.019
- "One minute. I'll check you out."
- Okay.

39:37.587 --> 39:40.177
Daniel, I'm back on post.

39:42.354 --> 39:44.913
Sir, down the hall.

39:48.624 --> 39:50.415
Move!

39:50.510 --> 39:52.625
<i>Code four, we have full lockdown.</i>

39:52.720 --> 39:55.664
<i>Code four, full lockdown.</i>

39:55.791 --> 39:58.831
<i>Security breach.
We have lock on all blocks.</i>

39:58.927 --> 40:01.454
<i>Security breach.
Lock on all blocks.</i>

40:03.309 --> 40:04.749
Open the cell blocks now.

40:04.878 --> 40:07.244
- Can't do it from here.
- Is it worth losing your life over?

40:07.341 --> 40:09.644
Do it now!

40:37.062 --> 40:39.431
Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
Yeah!

40:46.598 --> 40:48.739
Open the door!

40:59.554 --> 41:01.442
- Come on! Come on!
- Yeah!

41:01.539 --> 41:03.553
- Come on! Yeah!
- "Come on!"

41:06.720 --> 41:09.408
<i>Full lockdown. Code four.
We have full lockdown.</i>
