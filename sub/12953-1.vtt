00:38.530 --> 00:41.030
Is this okay for me?

00:41.116 --> 00:43.493
I just got it.

00:43.494 --> 00:45.578
For you? Yes.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.791
For you it's very... okay.

00:54.004 --> 00:56.089
For me, too.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.926
I am sorry for barging in to you.

01:04.138 --> 01:06.516
Is no problem.

01:06.517 --> 01:09.017
Do you travel much?

01:09.687 --> 01:12.063
Yes. For my work.

01:12.064 --> 01:13.769
I like the train.

01:13.770 --> 01:16.235
Yes.

01:16.270 --> 01:18.770
What is your work?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.072
I'm in chemical business.

01:21.073 --> 01:23.157
I knew something like that.

01:23.158 --> 01:24.659
- You did?
- Yes.

01:24.660 --> 01:28.163
Because I look at your hands
when I come in and I think,

01:29.248 --> 01:32.251
he uses brain more than hands.

01:33.836 --> 01:36.336
I use hands also.

01:37.423 --> 01:39.923
I am hoping so.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.475
So what is in case? Chemical?

01:50.853 --> 01:53.104
- Chemical, yes.
- No.

01:53.105 --> 01:55.691
Yes. Something danger.

01:56.025 --> 01:57.859
- In this, danger?
- Yes, in case.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.986
- I don't believe.
- Yes, it's true.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.030
Show me. I want to see.

02:02.031 --> 02:04.531
I want to see what you do.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.158
What is so danger?

02:26.222 --> 02:32.728
What is inside can be
used for good or evil.

02:33.979 --> 02:36.479
Me too.

02:38.067 --> 02:40.443
Open it.

02:40.444 --> 02:42.944
I want to see everything.

03:02.132 --> 03:03.841
Is isotope.

03:03.842 --> 03:06.342
Unstable, yes.

03:09.807 --> 03:13.477
What is...?

07:02.957 --> 07:04.290
Up here! Turn up here!

07:04.291 --> 07:06.791
- What? The next street?
- Yes! Left!

07:19.306 --> 07:21.934
The alley!

07:24.687 --> 07:27.523
Ah, it's locked! It's locked!

07:52.381 --> 07:53.298
All right.

07:53.299 --> 07:56.176
All right, at the very
least, I deserve answers.

07:56.385 --> 07:58.428
- We were compromised, Brodien.
- I figured that part out.

07:58.429 --> 07:59.762
We were supposed to meet at 10:15.

07:59.763 --> 08:01.973
- Extracted by 10:25.
- I was late.

08:01.974 --> 08:04.602
- Yeah, and I want to know why.
- Watch the door, please.

08:05.102 --> 08:07.730
There's a reason for protocol,
you know that? Where were you?

08:07.771 --> 08:09.022
Can we save the debrief
for the flight back?

08:09.023 --> 08:10.440
Didn't you try to contact agent Strum?

08:10.441 --> 08:11.691
I told you, his life is at risk.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.526
But he's in deep cover, agent Bristow.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.111
That's part of the job description.

08:15.112 --> 08:15.987
Safety's on.

08:15.988 --> 08:18.488
Mountaineer to
Shopkeeper, please respond.

08:19.783 --> 08:21.075
I need to use the bathroom.

08:21.076 --> 08:22.994
Then find another one, I'm busy.

08:22.995 --> 08:24.829
Mountaineer, this is Shopkeeper.

08:24.830 --> 08:26.915
Shopkeeper, your cover's been blown.

08:26.916 --> 08:29.125
We'll meet in the Ming Hai
train yard... 20 minutes.

08:29.126 --> 08:31.377
Wait a second.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.504
Wait. Wait, what are
you... how did you find me?

08:33.505 --> 08:34.255
How did you find me?

08:34.256 --> 08:35.131
Shopkeeper, do you copy?

08:35.131 --> 08:38.010
They know where I am! They
found me! They found me!

08:38.052 --> 08:40.552
What's happening?

08:43.682 --> 08:45.475
Hello, Sydney Bristow.

08:45.476 --> 08:48.437
I heard about what
you're wearing. I like it.

08:48.604 --> 08:51.104
But your work here in
Shanghai... not so good.

08:51.357 --> 08:55.361
You broke radio silence.
Sloppy. Disappointing.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.528
Who is this? What do you want?

08:57.529 --> 08:59.864
I just got what I wanted.

08:59.865 --> 09:01.866
We're tracking your
radio signal right now.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.618
We know the building
you're in. We're coming.

09:03.619 --> 09:06.119
They just tracked your broadcast?

09:09.208 --> 09:11.708
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.586
No, I'm not just following you
blind anymore. What's your plan?

09:13.587 --> 09:16.215
I don't have time to type an itinerary.
You do what I say, or you'll die.

09:16.298 --> 09:18.633
Now take off your shirt.

09:18.634 --> 09:20.301
That window's too small to climb out.

09:20.302 --> 09:22.802
I'm not climbing out.

09:24.265 --> 09:25.223
Close your eyes.

09:25.224 --> 09:27.267
- What the hell for?
- Close them.

09:27.268 --> 09:29.561
- Ow! That burns!
- Better than a bullet.

09:29.562 --> 09:32.062
- Oh, my god!
- Open.

09:32.314 --> 09:33.940
Ah, god!

09:33.941 --> 09:35.358
This part's gonna hurt more.

09:35.359 --> 09:37.610
- No. No, I don't need that.
- It's the details that matter.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.111
Try not to scream.

09:41.156 --> 09:43.656
I'm almost done.

09:49.707 --> 09:50.999
All right, what is that for?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
They'll be looking for two of us,

09:52.001 --> 09:53.376
so we're both gonna
walk out of here alone.

09:53.377 --> 09:54.752
They're gonna kill me, aren't they?

09:54.753 --> 09:57.005
They might. You've got
to strut out of this club.

09:57.006 --> 09:59.506
- I don't strut.
- Look at yourself

10:00.885 --> 10:01.843
My ear hurts.

10:01.844 --> 10:04.346
We'll meet at the Ding Ha
station. You won't need this.

10:05.139 --> 10:06.973
What are you gonna do? They
know what you look like.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.474
Come on already.

10:12.771 --> 10:15.271
How badly do you have to go?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.318
In your complaint against agent Bristow,

11:00.319 --> 11:02.821
you stated that your pursuers
tracked you to the restroom?

11:02.905 --> 11:04.322
Yes, ma'am, they did. When...

11:04.323 --> 11:07.743
When I made contact with agent
Strum. I wanted to help him.

11:08.160 --> 11:11.914
I made arrangements with agent Strum to
meet him at the closest LZ in Jing An.

11:12.748 --> 11:14.541
My intention was to extract him.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.543
That wasn't your purpose in Shanghai.

11:16.544 --> 11:18.044
You were sent with one objective...

11:18.045 --> 11:20.213
pick up surveillance
photos from agent Brodien...

11:20.214 --> 11:23.509
Yes, ma'am. Photos taken by agent Strum,
whose cover had already been blown.

11:23.634 --> 11:24.801
That's presupposition.

11:24.802 --> 11:26.803
A tip from an unauthenticated source,

11:26.804 --> 11:28.972
and you opted to change
the objective of the...

11:28.973 --> 11:30.181
I made a judgment call.

11:30.182 --> 11:32.768
You do understand that things don't always
go as expected when you're in the field.

11:32.977 --> 11:35.521
I don't need a lecture from
you. I've read your report.

11:36.272 --> 11:39.108
Even for you, agent Bristow,
your arrogance today is appalling.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.568
It wasn't meant to be a lecture,
director chase, just a reminder.

11:46.532 --> 11:49.243
With all due respect, it's been 12
years since you've been field-rated.

11:53.873 --> 11:57.418
Your poor judgment apparently
cost a man his life.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.717
So, after dressing him up,
you violated protocol yet again

12:04.752 --> 12:07.217
by leaving your contact alone.

12:08.387 --> 12:10.887
Mr. Brodien would have
been killed otherwise.

12:11.307 --> 12:13.807
Miss Bristow, your record's a mess.

12:13.851 --> 12:15.518
Your consistent disregard for protocol

12:15.519 --> 12:18.439
obviously speaks to some
larger systemic dysfunction.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.606
A psychological need
to challenge authority.

12:22.026 --> 12:24.277
If the shanghai incident
were an isolated one,

12:24.278 --> 12:26.529
then perhaps a warning
would suffice here.

12:26.530 --> 12:29.074
But this is hardly the first time
you've exhibited rogue behavior.

12:29.617 --> 12:31.576
What happened in Shanghai
was not rogue. I was trying...

12:31.577 --> 12:33.870
Miss Bristow, it's my turn to talk.

12:33.871 --> 12:37.208
I'm recommending to the board that
you be stripped of classified clearance

12:38.042 --> 12:40.542
and assigned to the
dispatch office at Langley.

12:40.544 --> 12:44.381
You're transferring me to the mailroom?

12:44.423 --> 12:47.051
You'll report to officer
Hermalin 8:00 A.M. On Monday.

12:47.551 --> 12:50.346
Let me get this straight. Is
this a permanent reassignment?

12:50.429 --> 12:52.889
Technically, that's what a demotion is.

12:52.890 --> 12:55.726
I don't know exactly what you have against
me, but my record has always been...

12:55.768 --> 12:58.144
I resent you, and I'll tell you why.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.773
It's conduct like yours
that endangers the CIA.

13:01.273 --> 13:04.109
It weakens us. It forces us
to take a defensive posture.

13:04.443 --> 13:07.029
Wait a minute. Am I
supposed to defend my record?

13:07.071 --> 13:09.571
This is not a dialogue, miss Bristow.

13:09.782 --> 13:12.282
In Virginia Monday morning.

13:14.450 --> 13:17.790
If this is your
decision, director Chase,

13:19.450 --> 13:23.500
I will no longer burden this agency
with the hazard of my participation.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.750
Are you opting to terminate
your association with the CIA?

13:26.882 --> 13:29.382
I will say it in English for you.

13:31.512 --> 13:34.012
I quit.

13:53.325 --> 13:55.825
Yo!

13:55.995 --> 13:56.744
Vaughn.

13:56.745 --> 13:59.245
Vaughn! Bag's dead,
man. You can give it up.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.334
Thanks for coming.

14:03.335 --> 14:05.503
Thanks for sweating.

14:05.504 --> 14:06.838
You all right?

14:06.839 --> 14:09.425
Yeah, I think that a full month of
psych evaluation's more than enough.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.801
Really? For you?

14:11.802 --> 14:14.302
I don't know.

14:14.513 --> 14:16.890
It was a little overkill, though.

14:16.891 --> 14:18.516
Come on. Burning your house down?

14:18.517 --> 14:19.893
It wasn't a happy home.

14:19.894 --> 14:21.477
Yeah, still... fire.

14:21.478 --> 14:24.857
Yeah, well, you kill your wife after learning
she's a vicious homicidal double agent.

14:24.892 --> 14:27.357
See how rational you are.

14:28.611 --> 14:31.111
I want you to know that I'm
there for you, whatever you need.

14:31.739 --> 14:35.242
You know, if you need to stay with
me for a while 'cause your house is...

14:36.368 --> 14:38.077
ashes.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.579
I'm leaving.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.497
Leaving what?

14:41.498 --> 14:43.124
The agency?

14:43.125 --> 14:44.751
Is this because of Sydney?

14:44.752 --> 14:47.252
It's not because of Sydney.
It's because last year sucked.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.380
It's because I don't
have the desire to do..

14:50.716 --> 14:53.344
not the desire, the need to do this
job anymore. I don't have it in me.

14:53.379 --> 14:56.722
So you're telling me that this
stupid idea was all on your own?

14:57.139 --> 14:58.556
Sydney didn't talk to you about this?

14:58.557 --> 15:00.350
I haven't spoken to her this week. Or
last. I don't know what's going on...

15:00.351 --> 15:01.434
You got to talk to her.

15:01.435 --> 15:03.935
Well, I've already made my decision.

15:04.021 --> 15:06.521
Okay, this isn't about you.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.900
Her review was today.

15:08.901 --> 15:11.401
Sydney quit.

17:35.923 --> 17:38.132
- Glad you found us.
- Me too.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.551
That wouldn't have
been a very good start.

17:39.552 --> 17:42.052
You did well with the
committee. Very convincing.

17:42.304 --> 17:45.057
Thank you. So you were you. I
actually felt like I was in trouble.

17:45.266 --> 17:47.600
Well, I can pull it out when I need to.

17:47.601 --> 17:49.060
Come on, let me show you around.

17:49.061 --> 17:50.311
How is that man's ear?

17:50.312 --> 17:52.812
Don't worry about Brodien.
He thinks he's a hero.

17:52.898 --> 17:55.398
He has no clue Shanghai was a charade.

17:55.693 --> 17:59.530
The agency's pacific rim surveillance
worked out of this office until '98.

18:00.072 --> 18:03.742
This place was dark until two months
ago when Langley approved the division.

18:04.285 --> 18:06.973
Miss Chase, I can't tell
you what an honor it is

18:07.008 --> 18:09.662
to have been asked to be
part of this operation.

18:10.332 --> 18:13.252
I know you spoke of being hungry,
looking for a fresh start..

18:13.287 --> 18:14.878
That was nothing.

18:14.879 --> 18:17.548
My father, Vaughn...
irrelevant personal stuff.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.966
I want to serve my
country the best I can.

18:19.967 --> 18:22.467
Well, this assignment
will be a challenge for you

18:22.636 --> 18:25.136
more than you were led to believe.

18:46.619 --> 18:48.912
The four of you were chosen.

18:48.913 --> 18:51.413
Handpicked to help run this team.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.666
The four of us?

18:55.753 --> 18:58.253
Handpicked by whom?

19:03.219 --> 19:05.719
This is exciting.

19:10.226 --> 19:12.726
Could I have a word, please?

19:17.191 --> 19:19.985
When I was approached about joining
a black ops unit within the CIA,

19:20.444 --> 19:22.612
I thought I was doing the right thing.

19:22.613 --> 19:25.532
And while I appreciate the necessary
protocol in assembling a new team,

19:25.574 --> 19:26.616
Arvin Sloane is not..

19:26.617 --> 19:28.284
I understand you used
to work for Sloane.

19:28.285 --> 19:30.829
Yeah, a criminal psychopath
beyond verbal description.

19:30.864 --> 19:32.455
I know all about Sloane.

19:32.456 --> 19:35.209
Then allow me to ask the most obvious
question in the history of time.

19:35.793 --> 19:38.293
How can the CIA let that man,

19:38.712 --> 19:40.588
who ran what amounts to a terrorist cell

19:40.589 --> 19:42.674
within the borders of
this country, run anything?

19:42.675 --> 19:45.427
You don't need me to explain
the geopolitical landscape,

19:45.886 --> 19:48.931
or to list this country's former
enemies with whom we now collaborate.

19:48.973 --> 19:50.431
You have to draw the line somewhere.

19:50.432 --> 19:52.475
We can use him now,

19:52.476 --> 19:54.227
his contacts, his expertise.

19:54.228 --> 19:56.728
And he will be closely monitored.

19:57.064 --> 19:59.564
Pity the man with that job.

20:04.196 --> 20:05.405
Wait a minute.

20:05.406 --> 20:07.448
With you here, Vaughn,
Dixon, and your father,

20:07.449 --> 20:09.949
there's a built-in system
of checks and balances.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.080
If Sloane missteps, you'll catch him.

20:15.374 --> 20:16.833
Now that's it.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.334
This is your assignment.

21:08.427 --> 21:10.971
I was just explaining
how the CIA approached me.

21:22.566 --> 21:24.901
Concerned that increased public scrutiny

21:24.902 --> 21:27.402
of the agency and the resulting red tape

21:27.780 --> 21:30.280
has impeded their
ability to do their job,

21:30.616 --> 21:33.118
what they asked me to set
up for them is a covert unit,

21:33.827 --> 21:36.327
one that is still governed by U.S. Laws

21:36.997 --> 21:39.497
but unhampered by
bureaucratic chain of command,

21:39.792 --> 21:42.292
with no accountability

21:42.795 --> 21:44.504
except to ourselves.

21:44.505 --> 21:46.631
That part was made clear.

21:46.632 --> 21:49.132
But the part that wasn't made clear,

21:50.511 --> 21:51.844
that's me.

21:51.845 --> 21:54.345
No, it wasn't.

21:54.723 --> 21:57.393
Well, quite frankly, I was
surprised by their call, too,

21:57.851 --> 22:00.351
until I understood what it is they want.

22:00.896 --> 22:02.814
Their own SD-6

22:02.815 --> 22:05.275
A unit that officially doesn't exist,

22:05.276 --> 22:09.697
comprised of team members who have
no apparent affiliation to the CIA.

22:10.030 --> 22:12.323
They don't want to know
how we do our day's work,

22:12.324 --> 22:13.741
only that it gets done.

22:13.742 --> 22:15.869
And what is our day's work?

22:15.870 --> 22:17.829
His name is Yuri Kamarov.

22:17.830 --> 22:20.330
He's Russia's leading nuclear scientist,

22:20.332 --> 22:24.295
until last month when he disappeared
with the only viable sample of orine-12,

22:24.712 --> 22:27.212
a deadly and highly unstable isotope.

22:27.631 --> 22:30.175
Signal intercepts
indicate that on Thursday

22:30.342 --> 22:33.929
Kamarov will have a meeting on the train
traveling between Belarus and Latvia.

22:34.388 --> 22:36.888
We can assume he will
be selling the isotope.

22:37.182 --> 22:40.060
The CIA is unable to use that
information, which is why we're here.

22:40.185 --> 22:43.063
Sydney, Vaughn, you
will be on that train.

22:43.188 --> 22:45.688
I can't believe this.

22:46.609 --> 22:48.526
I beg your pardon?

22:48.527 --> 22:49.360
Nothing.

22:49.361 --> 22:51.861
- The buyer, who is it?
- We don't know yet.

22:52.907 --> 22:56.327
But according to his grocery list,
we can assume he's a serious threat.

22:56.827 --> 22:59.078
We were able to intercept
the protocol of the meet.

22:59.079 --> 23:02.583
The buyer will be in the dining car
at 8:00 P.M. Greenwich mean time.

23:03.042 --> 23:05.878
There will be a green
fountain pen on the table.

23:06.212 --> 23:08.712
He will ask Kamarov if
he would like some tea.

23:09.215 --> 23:13.135
Kamarov will reply
that he prefers Bourbon.

23:14.261 --> 23:16.471
Dixon, you will be on point.

23:16.472 --> 23:20.392
Sydney, you will recover
Kamarov and the isotope.

23:21.518 --> 23:23.353
Vaughn, you will I.D. the buyer.

23:23.354 --> 23:27.066
You will sell him a bogus isotope
outfitted with a tracking device

23:27.274 --> 23:30.903
so that Langley can follow him
back to his base of operations

23:30.945 --> 23:32.528
and grab him there.

23:32.529 --> 23:33.363
Is that it?

23:33.364 --> 23:37.701
Kamarov is known to rig his
transport devices with self-destruct

23:38.160 --> 23:39.494
Yes, that's correct,

23:39.495 --> 23:41.995
so, Sydney, you'll need to get
him to open the case for you.

23:42.039 --> 23:43.748
Do you have any suggestions?

23:43.749 --> 23:46.249
I assume you'll come up
with something interesting.

23:46.710 --> 23:50.297
Jack, you'll set up the operational
plan for wheels up, 0600 hours.

23:51.465 --> 23:53.049
Are there any questions?

23:53.050 --> 23:54.801
Besides how'd you get this job?

23:54.802 --> 23:56.135
Sydney.

23:56.136 --> 23:58.636
Syd.

24:02.017 --> 24:04.269
What is this, A.P.O.?

24:04.270 --> 24:06.770
It's the name of our new organization.

24:07.189 --> 24:09.689
It's right on the door.

24:10.526 --> 24:13.026
Authorized Personnel Only.

24:13.237 --> 24:15.113
I thought it was fitting.

24:15.114 --> 24:17.614
Excuse me. I have to prep

24:38.554 --> 24:41.265
If I'd known Sloane was
involved, not a chance.

24:41.390 --> 24:42.932
It was a little deceitful, right?

24:42.933 --> 24:45.143
Yeah, but then I thought
if I refused the job,

24:45.144 --> 24:46.102
I can't watch over Sloane.

24:46.103 --> 24:48.313
I'm having the same
conversation with myself.

24:48.314 --> 24:51.108
You know, I told Langley that I
wanted to step down as director.

24:51.859 --> 24:55.446
That life, that suit was never
for me. I belong in the field.

24:55.988 --> 24:57.322
And then the offer came from Chase.

24:57.323 --> 24:59.198
"An elite black ops unit" speech.

24:59.199 --> 25:01.699
Yeah, that's the one, and I was in.

25:07.791 --> 25:10.544
Look, I understand your
reluctance to work with me, given..

25:11.921 --> 25:14.421
well, given everything.

25:14.882 --> 25:17.382
But despite my former allegiance,

25:17.760 --> 25:19.719
my betrayal of you,

25:19.720 --> 25:21.721
of this country,

25:21.722 --> 25:24.015
you can't deny it.

25:24.016 --> 25:26.516
We were a great team.

25:27.311 --> 25:29.771
So I'll do this just once,

25:29.772 --> 25:32.272
and ask you to please

25:32.900 --> 25:35.400
give me a chance.

25:44.245 --> 25:46.745
One thing makes up for all this.

25:48.374 --> 25:50.874
Having you as my partner again.

26:33.586 --> 26:36.086
- Sorry to drop by.
- It's okay.

26:36.547 --> 26:38.631
I miss you.

26:38.632 --> 26:41.132
I wanted to say that I miss you.

26:41.927 --> 26:44.427
I've been thinking,

26:44.513 --> 26:47.161
- obviously, about what..
- What, you were afraid to..

26:47.196 --> 26:49.809
- I'm not afraid, but I..
- You didn't return my calls.

26:49.810 --> 26:52.310
That's 'cause I could
feel what was happening.

26:57.067 --> 26:58.776
Can I come in?

26:58.777 --> 27:01.277
If you come in, we both
know what's going to happen.

27:01.906 --> 27:04.032
I don't want that.

27:04.033 --> 27:07.161
To jump right back in where
we were before everything,

27:08.579 --> 27:11.079
to pretend like those
years didn't happen.

27:11.081 --> 27:13.581
Well, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

27:15.294 --> 27:17.794
But they did.

27:18.339 --> 27:20.839
We need to take it slow, Vaughn.

27:22.551 --> 27:25.051
Yeah. You're probably right.

27:42.154 --> 27:45.115
- You ready?
- Ja, I think so. You?

28:03.133 --> 28:05.218
Excuse me!

28:05.219 --> 28:05.718
Hello!

28:05.719 --> 28:07.762
This is a private compartment.

28:07.763 --> 28:09.222
This is my room.

28:09.223 --> 28:11.723
This isn't your room.

28:18.023 --> 28:20.734
- Are you speaking English?
- Yes, I speak.

28:21.151 --> 28:23.651
See for me, this room?

29:03.152 --> 29:05.652
Care for some tea?

29:05.821 --> 29:08.321
No, I prefer Bourbon.

29:12.870 --> 29:14.871
You're early.

29:14.872 --> 29:17.332
I am eager to make exchange.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.833
As am I, Mr. Kamarov.

29:20.085 --> 29:21.377
I.. I am sorry.

29:21.378 --> 29:23.878
- Ticket is good, no?
- Yes, it's good.

29:29.845 --> 29:32.345
I was drink... in dining car...

29:33.265 --> 29:35.765
- too much.
- Oh. Yeah.

29:37.394 --> 29:39.894
I am for sleeping now.

29:43.567 --> 29:46.067
Is there a place for changing?

29:48.113 --> 29:50.240
Uh, yes.

29:50.241 --> 29:52.741
Bathroom.

29:52.868 --> 29:55.368
Thank you.

29:59.375 --> 30:01.875
You are cute.

30:05.089 --> 30:07.589
I like these framings.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.609
You want to do this in public?

30:26.610 --> 30:29.110
Mr. Vadik is not afraid of the public,

30:30.072 --> 30:32.572
and neither am I.

31:10.821 --> 31:14.408
Is this okay for me? I just got it.

31:15.242 --> 31:17.870
For you? Yes.

31:18.621 --> 31:21.290
For you it's very... okay.

31:24.043 --> 31:26.754
You can't test power with
toy from hardware store.

31:33.010 --> 31:35.510
When the more comprehensive
tests are done,

31:35.512 --> 31:38.012
Mr. Vadik will forward you
the other half of your payment.

31:41.644 --> 31:44.062
You're not very discreet.

31:44.063 --> 31:45.897
Terror happens every day.

31:45.898 --> 31:47.982
Around everyone.

31:47.983 --> 31:50.903
And no one notices a thing
until something detonates.

31:53.864 --> 31:56.364
Mr. Vadik and I rely on that.

32:06.752 --> 32:09.045
What is your work?

32:09.046 --> 32:10.922
I'm in chemical business.

32:10.923 --> 32:12.549
I knew something like that.

32:12.550 --> 32:14.551
- You did?
- Yes.

32:14.552 --> 32:18.138
Because I look at your hands
when I come in and I think,

32:19.014 --> 32:21.725
he uses brain more than hands.

32:30.776 --> 32:33.276
You look familiar.

32:34.238 --> 32:36.949
Sometimes people tell me I look
like hockey player... Alexei Kovalev.

32:40.578 --> 32:43.078
No.

32:44.331 --> 32:46.831
That's not it.

32:56.468 --> 32:58.553
Ah, perhaps we have met before.

32:58.554 --> 33:01.223
Maybe your boss, Mr.
Vadik. Maybe I know him.

33:20.242 --> 33:21.492
What is this?

33:21.493 --> 33:22.911
I don't know where you're from,

33:22.912 --> 33:24.412
but you're not Kamarov.

33:24.413 --> 33:26.913
Excuse me? This is me.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.750
I'm getting off the
train a little early.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.382
Find out who he is.

33:56.153 --> 33:58.948
Syd, they're on to us. Get out of
there. There's one coming your way. Move!

33:59.782 --> 34:02.282
What is it?

34:03.661 --> 34:06.161
Get up.

34:22.054 --> 34:24.554
Here.

35:14.899 --> 35:17.399
Are you kidding?!

37:35.331 --> 37:39.627
Syd, before we left, Jack came
to see me with a message for you.

37:42.463 --> 37:44.297
Your father wanted me
to remind you that in

37:44.298 --> 37:46.798
Belarus we're not gonna
have a tactical team.

37:49.637 --> 37:52.473
So why is your father
talking to you through me?

37:59.730 --> 38:01.689
When I was in D.C.,

38:01.690 --> 38:04.693
I know that you went to Wittenberg,
and I know your father was there.

38:08.113 --> 38:10.613
What happened in Wittenberg?

38:51.532 --> 38:54.032
Sydney.

38:57.788 --> 39:00.288
You were never supposed
to have found this.

39:04.879 --> 39:07.379
You want to tell me what
happened in Wittenberg?

39:12.386 --> 39:14.886
No, actually, I don't.

39:25.774 --> 39:28.652
We now know the men on the train
were working for Roman Vadik,

39:29.153 --> 39:31.154
CIA's 26th most wanted.

39:31.155 --> 39:35.409
Vadik's résumé has him responsible for
the Chunei blast in '86, Matsu in '89,

39:35.444 --> 39:37.577
over 12,000 dead total.

39:37.578 --> 39:39.704
Close personal contacts
of mine have confirmed

39:39.705 --> 39:42.165
Vadik's cooperation with
known terrorist cells

39:42.166 --> 39:44.666
in planning a major attack
within the next six months.

39:44.668 --> 39:47.168
Close personal contacts?

39:48.297 --> 39:51.008
- CIA wants Vadik.
- Yes, that's right.

39:51.175 --> 39:52.091
What's the move?

39:52.092 --> 39:55.387
Last year, a foreign agent working
on infiltrating Vadik's operation

39:55.422 --> 39:57.887
made particularly good progress.

39:57.973 --> 39:59.974
She needs to be debriefed.

39:59.975 --> 40:02.561
I'm sending you, Sydney. I'll
give you the details in my office.

40:03.479 --> 40:05.979
Lucky me.

40:09.735 --> 40:12.235
The agent working with Vadik's operation

40:13.614 --> 40:16.114
was with argentine intelligence.

40:16.116 --> 40:18.616
- Your daughter?
- Your sister.

40:20.037 --> 40:24.333
If Nadia's the one with intel on
Vadik, why not debrief her yourself?

40:27.086 --> 40:29.586
We went searching,

40:30.381 --> 40:32.881
Nadia and I,

40:34.301 --> 40:36.804
for an artifact built by Rambaldi.

40:38.013 --> 40:40.513
Its value immeasurable.

40:41.183 --> 40:43.268
And we found it.

40:43.269 --> 40:45.769
And we promptly handed it
over to the U.S. government.

40:46.814 --> 40:49.314
That's how you got this position.

40:50.526 --> 40:52.735
You bought it.

40:52.736 --> 40:55.948
It turns out the pain that she felt
as a result of her job was profound,

40:57.199 --> 40:59.617
something with which you're familiar.

40:59.618 --> 41:00.994
You think?

41:00.995 --> 41:04.248
I tried to convince her to stay,
to transfer over to the CIA.

41:05.249 --> 41:07.749
I knew she would be of great value here.

41:09.003 --> 41:11.503
But she chose to leave intelligence,

41:12.256 --> 41:14.716
to drop out.

41:14.717 --> 41:16.551
You're sure she really left?

41:16.552 --> 41:18.636
Fake quitting seems to be all the rage.

41:18.637 --> 41:21.137
She's out. She's back in Argentina.

41:22.266 --> 41:24.766
She wants nothing to
do with me or this life.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.020
You're awfully glib, Sydney.

41:29.356 --> 41:31.856
Nadia left you on bad terms.

41:34.904 --> 41:40.492
I suppose I have something
to learn about being a father.

41:43.204 --> 41:45.704
I can see why you don't want to go.

41:46.123 --> 41:48.623
That wasn't meant to be glib.

41:50.961 --> 41:53.461
I still don't know why you
think she'll talk to me.

41:54.048 --> 41:56.548
Because I see in her
something I once saw in you,

41:56.800 --> 41:59.300
the need to work for what's right.

41:59.637 --> 42:02.181
And because you know what it
is to put aside personal issues.

42:02.306 --> 42:04.474
And that,

42:04.475 --> 42:06.184
that's a gift.

42:06.185 --> 42:07.894
It's not a gift.

42:07.895 --> 42:10.773
What it's been is a necessity,
and it's become a burden,

42:12.024 --> 42:14.652
and quite frankly, something
I have run out of patience for.

42:24.828 --> 42:28.207
Vaughn, before she goes,
you might tell her the truth.

42:28.249 --> 42:30.333
No, I'm not gonna be a
conduit to your daughter.

42:30.334 --> 42:32.836
I've tried that before. You can
imagine how well that went over.

42:33.045 --> 42:36.173
And, no, she didn't say anything, if
that's what you're asking yourself.

42:36.257 --> 42:38.801
She hasn't said a word about anything
that happened between the two of you.

42:39.718 --> 42:42.221
Which gives me an idea of what that is.

42:42.471 --> 42:45.057
And, Jack, I hope for
Sydney's sake that I'm wrong.

43:47.411 --> 43:49.911
I'm guessing this
isn't a personal visit.

43:51.123 --> 43:53.623
No.

43:54.919 --> 43:57.419
Roman Vadik.

43:59.131 --> 44:01.631
We need your help.

44:03.260 --> 44:05.094
Nadia, I need you to come back with me.

44:05.095 --> 44:06.721
No.

44:06.722 --> 44:09.222
Sydney...

44:16.065 --> 44:17.982
He was a good friend.

44:17.983 --> 44:20.483
Worked with me.

44:22.404 --> 44:24.904
Vadik killed him.

44:25.032 --> 44:27.116
Had his...

44:27.117 --> 44:29.617
head shipped back to our office.

44:33.457 --> 44:35.957
But I'll give you what I have.

44:37.336 --> 44:41.006
No one deals with Vadik directly.
Everything goes through his lieutenant.

44:41.090 --> 44:42.882
- You want to write this down?
- No, I got it.

44:42.883 --> 44:44.676
Kazu Tamazaki.

44:44.677 --> 44:47.179
Considers himself a modern samurai.

44:47.388 --> 44:52.351
Arrested five years ago trying to rob
the Hasunaga Asian museum in London.

44:52.434 --> 44:54.060
Escaped from police custody.

44:54.061 --> 44:56.561
Among the least of the
charges against him.

44:56.897 --> 44:58.189
I hope that helps.

44:58.190 --> 45:01.277
Men like Vadik, like Tamazaki,
they need to be eliminated.

45:01.402 --> 45:03.902
I can't.

45:08.075 --> 45:10.575
I can't.

45:11.829 --> 45:14.329
You do understand?

45:14.623 --> 45:17.123
Yeah.

45:30.055 --> 45:32.808
- I made penne. There was...
- This cannot continue.

45:33.809 --> 45:37.271
A crucial assumption of our
operational competence is communication!

45:37.897 --> 45:39.981
Sydney, if we don't have that,

45:39.982 --> 45:43.068
every mission, the life of every
operative, could be at risk.

45:43.152 --> 45:43.985
I'm doing my job.

45:43.986 --> 45:46.530
No. What you need to do is find
a way to accept what's happened.

45:46.655 --> 45:48.114
If you can deal with Arvin Sloane...

45:48.115 --> 45:50.951
I love that you knew
that, that you approved it.

45:51.202 --> 45:53.077
It may be hard for you
to accept that your father

45:53.078 --> 45:55.163
doesn't have the authority to
make all the decisions that...

45:55.164 --> 45:58.500
No, what's hard for me to accept
are the decisions that you do make.

46:00.502 --> 46:02.295
What's hard is looking at you.

46:02.296 --> 46:03.421
Walking past you,

46:03.422 --> 46:05.925
smelling that sickening cologne.

46:06.008 --> 46:08.802
What's hard is being your daughter

46:08.928 --> 46:12.223
and not being able to separate
myself as far as I may get

46:12.431 --> 46:14.931
from the person I despise the most.

46:19.939 --> 46:22.439
You went to see Nadia.

46:22.942 --> 46:25.442
Did you tell her what you know?

46:39.833 --> 46:42.252
I guess I thought

46:42.253 --> 46:44.753
that maybe you'd come here,

46:45.130 --> 46:47.758
I don't know, to give me
something, information...

46:49.510 --> 46:52.596
something that would help make sense
of what I was afraid you'd become,

46:52.680 --> 46:55.180
but there's nothing you could say.

46:56.684 --> 46:59.478
Of course you were only
looking out for yourself.

47:01.647 --> 47:04.775
Is that what you think
of me as an operative?

47:05.317 --> 47:10.197
That I would reveal your
secret to that poor girl?

47:14.660 --> 47:17.160
I didn't tell Nadia a thing.

47:35.139 --> 47:37.639
Sorry.

47:48.527 --> 47:51.027
What's going on?

47:51.488 --> 47:53.988
It was Lauren who told me.

47:55.117 --> 47:57.535
What?

47:57.536 --> 48:00.036
Told me where to look.

48:01.415 --> 48:03.915
Safety deposit box in Wittenberg.

48:11.091 --> 48:13.591
How she knew, I don't know.

48:14.762 --> 48:18.265
I wasn't even going to go. I had no
reason to believe anything that woman said.

48:22.061 --> 48:24.772
But the curiosity was just too strong.

48:30.611 --> 48:32.487
I got there.

48:32.488 --> 48:34.988
Inside the box, there was a file.

48:35.491 --> 48:36.658
Classified.

48:36.659 --> 48:39.159
Highest level.

48:44.625 --> 48:51.840
My heart was pounding, like
I knew somehow before I knew.

48:53.759 --> 48:56.259
What was it?

48:57.638 --> 49:00.138
Evidence.

49:01.350 --> 49:03.476
Evidence that my mother
had been a security risk,

49:03.477 --> 49:05.977
which wasn't really news.

49:06.480 --> 49:09.900
It mentioned her history with
the KGB... everything we knew.

49:15.239 --> 49:17.739
Then there was a page.

49:20.119 --> 49:22.619
An official request made by my father

49:24.415 --> 49:28.085
asking for the authority
to execute Irina Derevko.

49:29.837 --> 49:32.337
A request that was granted.

49:35.050 --> 49:37.550
And he did it.

49:40.764 --> 49:43.264
He killed her.

49:47.855 --> 49:50.355
He killed my mother.

49:55.112 --> 49:57.612
He did it, Vaughn.

49:58.908 --> 50:00.783
He killed her.

50:00.784 --> 50:03.284
He killed my mother.

50:18.886 --> 50:20.970
Two weeks ago, the man on the train,

50:20.971 --> 50:23.849
Kazu Tamazaki, severed ties
with all known contacts,

50:23.933 --> 50:25.850
eliminated all means of communication.

50:25.851 --> 50:27.393
Any idea where he's gone or why?

50:27.394 --> 50:30.606
Nothing. Our one link to
Roman Vadik has disappeared.

50:30.648 --> 50:32.857
Any indication Vadik turned on Tamazaki?

50:32.858 --> 50:35.235
All chatter says that
Vadik is status quo.

50:35.236 --> 50:36.986
So Tamazaki is still all we've got.

50:36.987 --> 50:38.529
All we had. He's gone.

50:38.530 --> 50:40.281
Back to what we know.

50:40.282 --> 50:42.910
The Hasunaga Asian museum in London.

50:43.285 --> 50:46.205
Yeah, Nadia said he was arrested
five years ago... a break-in.

50:46.288 --> 50:47.372
Was there a motive?

50:47.373 --> 50:50.292
He was caught in the
Shintaro sword exhibit.

50:50.543 --> 50:53.295
Shootout, killed two MPs
and one of his own men.

50:53.379 --> 50:54.462
What was he doing?

50:54.463 --> 50:56.881
Trying to steal the Shintaro sword,

50:56.882 --> 51:00.052
the most famous samurai
sword outside of Japan,

51:00.135 --> 51:02.805
wanting to restore honor to
the blade and to his country.

51:02.888 --> 51:03.846
You got to be kidding me.

51:03.847 --> 51:05.890
We may not have the
means to contact Tamazaki,

51:05.891 --> 51:10.563
but I can see a way to
get Tamazaki to contact us.

51:10.646 --> 51:13.482
Are you suggesting we fake
a robbery of the Hasunaga?

51:19.029 --> 51:21.529
You think we should steal the sword.

51:21.907 --> 51:24.702
That museum's one of
the world's most secure.

51:24.785 --> 51:26.619
If this were my operation,

51:26.620 --> 51:29.331
there's only one man I'd
trust to get us in there.

51:34.211 --> 51:35.962
Hey,

51:35.963 --> 51:38.463
you as depressed as I am?

51:38.757 --> 51:39.799
Depressed about what?

51:39.800 --> 51:41.759
Depressed about what?

51:41.760 --> 51:42.760
Take a look around here.

51:42.761 --> 51:43.845
This place is a ghost town.

51:43.846 --> 51:46.346
I don't even know anybody here anymore.

51:49.894 --> 51:51.644
Sydney's gone,

51:51.645 --> 51:54.815
Dixon, Jack, Vaughn.

51:54.899 --> 51:56.316
The only guy we have left is Sark,

51:56.317 --> 51:57.567
and that's only because he's in custody.

51:57.568 --> 51:59.903
Hate that guy. I mean,
really, kind of scar...

51:59.904 --> 52:04.325
although I did go visit him
twice, just to see a familiar face.

52:04.450 --> 52:05.950
We had eggs.

52:05.951 --> 52:08.451
Don't do that.

52:19.131 --> 52:22.343
Marshall Flinkman, you're under arrest
for the misuse of government assets.

52:22.426 --> 52:24.093
Misuse? What? What did I misuse?

52:24.094 --> 52:27.306
Unauthorized computer equipment may be
connected to the monitors you've been provided.

52:27.431 --> 52:29.724
Connected? I don't understand.
What did I have connected?

52:29.725 --> 52:32.225
Is this yours?

52:32.728 --> 52:33.686
Uh...

52:33.687 --> 52:35.438
It was for a mission. I swear.

52:35.439 --> 52:37.357
I just wanted to download
some maps from Conquer Quest.

52:37.358 --> 52:40.027
I heard they were really good. Of
course, the CIA maps are much better...

52:46.867 --> 52:48.243
Am I dead?

52:48.244 --> 52:50.662
You've been recruited.

52:50.663 --> 52:52.956
We're a black ops division, Marshall.

52:52.957 --> 52:55.457
You're going to head up technology.

52:59.463 --> 53:01.963
Uh, Syd...

53:02.800 --> 53:05.218
Sloane is here.

53:05.219 --> 53:07.719
We know.

53:08.305 --> 53:10.805
Okay.

53:11.684 --> 53:13.476
Syd.

53:13.477 --> 53:15.977
We're back.

53:33.497 --> 53:36.208
Merlin to team. Great. Way to go, guys.

53:36.417 --> 53:37.750
Stay focused.

53:37.751 --> 53:40.251
They're focused.

53:48.846 --> 53:51.390
Okay, Shotgun to Merlin.
Tapping into surveillance.

54:03.652 --> 54:05.236
Okay, I can see it.

54:05.237 --> 54:07.737
The Shintaro sword.

54:12.036 --> 54:15.080
It's a studler matrix
system. What am I looking for?

54:15.873 --> 54:19.460
- Okay, studler matrix.
- What fuse?

54:20.461 --> 54:21.377
L7.

54:21.378 --> 54:23.129
Copy that. Looping I7.

54:23.130 --> 54:24.672
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute!

54:24.673 --> 54:26.883
That would be bad. Don't do that.

54:26.884 --> 54:31.055
You need to re-route through E3.

54:33.432 --> 54:34.599
E3 rerouted.

54:34.600 --> 54:35.892
Okay, go to L7.

54:35.893 --> 54:38.393
Copy that. Looping L7.

54:42.691 --> 54:45.191
Okay, the security feed's looped.

54:51.242 --> 54:53.911
Outrigger, something fell down the vent.

54:55.412 --> 54:57.288
Cooney to control.

54:57.289 --> 54:58.498
Right, Cooney.

54:58.499 --> 55:01.961
Check floor two, would you?
I think I heard something.

55:03.087 --> 55:05.088
No, it's all clear.

55:05.089 --> 55:07.589
You're still good.

55:11.053 --> 55:13.346
Hey...

55:13.347 --> 55:15.265
Good luck.

55:15.266 --> 55:17.766
Thanks.

55:22.022 --> 55:23.189
How cool is this?

55:23.190 --> 55:25.316
Stealing a sword so
we can find a bad guy,

55:25.317 --> 55:27.817
you know, in order to catch
an even bigger bad guy?

55:27.861 --> 55:30.864
Come on. Come on, you would never
let us do this back in the CIA...

55:30.948 --> 55:34.785
you know, when you were
double-breasted serious robot Dixon.

55:35.578 --> 55:36.744
I mean, not that you...

55:36.745 --> 55:39.874
you were just... authoritative.

55:40.165 --> 55:42.665
I'm sorry.

55:46.797 --> 55:49.800
Outrigger to base. ETA 90 seconds.

55:50.509 --> 55:53.929
Security cameras are on
loop. So far, so good.

57:10.172 --> 57:11.297
The biggest challenge,

57:11.298 --> 57:13.174
hands down,

57:13.175 --> 57:15.675
is that pressure pad on the case.

57:16.512 --> 57:18.429
You know, the marble border.

57:18.430 --> 57:21.809
There's no way to deactivate
it. Super-calibrated.

57:39.827 --> 57:40.869
Phoenix, you've got company.

57:40.870 --> 57:43.370
Tango headed your way. ETA 20 seconds.

57:44.957 --> 57:47.250
Phoenix, abort! Repeat, abort!

57:47.251 --> 57:49.751
I'm almost there.

57:52.339 --> 57:54.257
Phoenix, he's coming.
Get out of there now!

57:54.258 --> 57:56.758
I'm almost there.

58:32.504 --> 58:35.004
Damn it!

58:51.565 --> 58:54.193
Phoenix to base. I'm in the East
alley. I need an extraction now!

58:54.276 --> 58:56.361
Find a secondary route.
We're at 60 seconds out.

58:56.362 --> 58:59.156
I don't have 60 seconds. I'll
meet you at the LZ. I'm going.

59:17.216 --> 59:19.133
Sydney, get in.

59:19.134 --> 59:21.634
Get in now. You can be stubborn later.

59:22.346 --> 59:23.555
Outrigger, this is Raptor.

59:23.556 --> 59:25.056
I have Phoenix. Heading to rendezvous.

59:25.057 --> 59:25.932
What are you doing here?

59:25.933 --> 59:27.809
You know what else typically
works in a situation like this?

59:27.810 --> 59:30.310
A simple "thank you". Get down.

59:50.916 --> 59:53.416
You didn't tell her, did you? The truth?

59:54.962 --> 59:59.133
I told her that I was responsible
for the death of her mother.

59:59.466 --> 01:00:01.259
Did you tell her everything?

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.804
She's better off not knowing everything.

01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:08.014
Tough call, Jack.

01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:11.851
Better that she detest me.

01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:15.566
I fear the alternative would
have left her incapacitated.

01:00:24.450 --> 01:00:27.119
I assume you have something to sell.

01:00:27.244 --> 01:00:29.744
I have the Shintaro sword.

01:00:32.625 --> 01:00:36.378
Herr Vogel, you never
cease to astound me.

01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:39.337
An inside job, no doubt, yes?

01:00:40.132 --> 01:00:42.050
No matter.

01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:44.845
People on the streets are
impressed. An incredible job.

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:47.890
My friends are good at what they do.

01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:50.515
Let me make a few calls.

01:00:52.228 --> 01:00:52.977
It's done.

01:00:52.978 --> 01:00:55.478
Good work. Head home.

01:00:56.732 --> 01:00:58.900
Dixon put the sword in play.

01:00:58.901 --> 01:01:01.401
We can expect to hear
from Tamazaki within hours.

01:01:05.199 --> 01:01:07.575
It's good, isn't it?

01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:11.121
Having the team back
together again. Hmm?

01:01:18.379 --> 01:01:19.546
Anything?

01:01:19.547 --> 01:01:21.673
Oh, uh, hey.

01:01:21.674 --> 01:01:24.343
Well, mostly what we already know.

01:01:24.426 --> 01:01:26.926
Roman Vadik is some serious bad news.

01:01:27.012 --> 01:01:29.512
Check this out.

01:01:30.432 --> 01:01:32.932
Pakistan... 500 casualties.

01:01:33.435 --> 01:01:36.897
Prime minister of Kafiristan
assassinated in broad daylight.

01:01:39.692 --> 01:01:40.733
Who's that?

01:01:40.734 --> 01:01:43.234
Uh, that's Pablo Martinez.
He's an Argentinean agent.

01:01:43.279 --> 01:01:45.363
He was investigating Vadik last year.

01:01:45.364 --> 01:01:47.864
He was caught. Vadik had him killed.

01:01:48.576 --> 01:01:50.243
Yeah.

01:01:50.244 --> 01:01:52.537
Martinez was partners with Nadia Santos.

01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:55.038
- Your sister?
- Half-sister.

01:01:55.833 --> 01:01:59.044
Well, he was the only one
who ever saw Vadik alive.

01:01:59.128 --> 01:02:01.212
I mean, at least on our side.

01:02:01.213 --> 01:02:04.008
He wasn't transmitting, was
he, when he was captured?

01:02:14.184 --> 01:02:15.935
I'll make you a deal.

01:02:15.936 --> 01:02:18.396
You cooperate with us.

01:02:18.397 --> 01:02:19.689
That's it.

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:21.524
You don't frighten me.

01:02:21.525 --> 01:02:24.025
Then clearly you're an idiot.

01:02:24.403 --> 01:02:27.323
The man you were working
for on the train, Tamazaki,

01:02:27.448 --> 01:02:30.117
he referred to his boss... Mr. Vadik.

01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:32.285
But we ran voice prints.

01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:38.542
Yeah, um, an agent was killed last
year by Vadik, but his voice...

01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:42.254
you know, the killer... it matches
perfectly with the man on the train.

01:02:42.338 --> 01:02:43.379
Tamazaki.

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.260
Which means Vadik trusts Tamazaki enough
to front for him, act on his behalf.

01:02:48.636 --> 01:02:54.225
Simple deduction says that if
Tamazaki trusts you, you've seen Vadik.

01:03:03.192 --> 01:03:05.692
Where do we find Vadik?

01:03:08.822 --> 01:03:11.534
I'll need protective services for this.

01:03:12.368 --> 01:03:14.868
You help us, and you have my word.

01:03:16.747 --> 01:03:19.247
Vadik.

01:03:25.089 --> 01:03:27.589
You had him.

01:03:29.218 --> 01:03:31.718
Vadik is Tamazaki.

01:03:33.055 --> 01:03:35.014
There is no Vadik.

01:03:35.015 --> 01:03:36.516
It's a cover.

01:03:36.517 --> 01:03:38.726
He made him up.

01:03:38.727 --> 01:03:41.227
There's no Vadik.

01:03:42.731 --> 01:03:44.524
Vadik doesn't exist at all.

01:03:44.525 --> 01:03:47.025
It's actually Tamazaki who's in charge.

01:03:47.152 --> 01:03:49.652
We need a new game plan.

01:03:50.197 --> 01:03:51.114
Yes?

01:03:51.115 --> 01:03:52.657
Tamazaki took the bait.

01:03:52.658 --> 01:03:55.286
We're set for a Wednesday
meet in Rio de Janeiro.

01:03:55.411 --> 01:03:58.664
He insists that the woman who
stole the sword make the delivery.

01:03:58.789 --> 01:04:01.292
Apparently he has access to
police files. He was intrigued.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:02.250
What about backup?

01:04:02.251 --> 01:04:03.501
She's allowed one additional.

01:04:03.502 --> 01:04:05.837
Good. Jack, you escort
Sydney with the sword.

01:04:05.838 --> 01:04:09.008
Vaughn, Marshall, you'll support
Dixon. I want a plan by 1800.

01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:11.050
Excuse me.

01:04:11.051 --> 01:04:13.551
I'd prefer Dixon as my partner.

01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:16.055
I'm sure you're aware of our
experience together in the field.

01:04:16.056 --> 01:04:18.308
That shorthand could be important.

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:20.809
I've already made my assignments.

01:04:38.245 --> 01:04:40.038
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:04:40.039 --> 01:04:41.539
As soon as Tamazaki makes contact,

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.458
we'll I.D. and take
out any backup he's got,

01:04:43.459 --> 01:04:45.959
then we'll move in, grab
him, get on the plane.

01:04:50.966 --> 01:04:52.425
Team's in position. Mikes are hot.

01:04:52.426 --> 01:04:53.718
We've got full visual.

01:04:53.719 --> 01:04:54.969
Phoenix, Raptor, it's your show.

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:57.470
Copy that, Outrigger.

01:05:04.647 --> 01:05:07.358
This is the best conversation
we've had in weeks.

01:05:17.076 --> 01:05:19.787
Merlin, patch this call through my
ear piece to the rest of the team.

01:05:19.912 --> 01:05:23.332
Okay, Phoenix, you are hot.
And I mean that in many ways.

01:05:23.415 --> 01:05:25.915
Shotgun, you're in on the call.

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:28.962
Hello?

01:05:28.963 --> 01:05:32.633
Look across the square.
You'll see a tunnel.

01:05:33.509 --> 01:05:35.760
It will take you to the
belly of the Alves building.

01:05:35.761 --> 01:05:37.178
Go to the 10th floor.

01:05:37.179 --> 01:05:39.138
No backup, no guns.

01:05:39.139 --> 01:05:40.473
Just the sword.

01:05:40.474 --> 01:05:42.642
Meet me in three minutes, or it's off.

01:05:42.643 --> 01:05:43.726
Merlin, the Alves building.

01:05:43.727 --> 01:05:46.062
Now listen, this building was
converted into a bank last year.

01:05:46.063 --> 01:05:48.064
Shotgun, you're gonna
have to look the part.

01:05:48.065 --> 01:05:50.776
Okay, we've got wardrobe. Let's do it.

01:05:53.946 --> 01:05:56.657
I'm going in... alone.

01:05:57.992 --> 01:06:00.619
I assume you all heard that.

01:06:05.207 --> 01:06:07.707
Starting through the tunnel.

01:06:11.088 --> 01:06:13.381
Phoenix, meet me at the
elevators before you go up.

01:06:13.382 --> 01:06:15.882
See you at the elevator.

01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:21.682
Okay, now that tunnel was reinforced
after the earthquake of '44.

01:06:21.807 --> 01:06:24.307
We're probably gonna lose comms until...

01:06:39.867 --> 01:06:43.245
Shotgun, we've temporarily
lost contact with Phoenix.

01:06:50.169 --> 01:06:53.130
Merlin, tell me there's a
10th floor in this building.

01:06:57.301 --> 01:06:59.801
Guys...

01:08:15.254 --> 01:08:17.754
Hello, Sydney Bristow.

01:08:58.214 --> 01:09:01.550
If Tamazaki wanted to kill
Sydney, we're already too late.

01:09:01.884 --> 01:09:05.179
The only assumption we can operate
on practically is that Sydney is alive

01:09:05.429 --> 01:09:07.929
and Tamazaki has some need for her.

01:09:08.098 --> 01:09:09.182
So where is she?

01:09:09.183 --> 01:09:11.852
Rio was Tamazaki's call,
not mine. It's his turf.

01:09:11.935 --> 01:09:13.937
Meaning he most likely
has some sort of base here,

01:09:13.938 --> 01:09:15.270
satellite office maybe.

01:09:15.272 --> 01:09:18.149
Marshall, does Tamazaki's file
indicate property holdings?

01:09:18.442 --> 01:09:21.069
I already checked. Nothing. Nothing
in Rio, nothing anywhere in Brazil.

01:09:21.153 --> 01:09:22.194
We know someone with intel...

01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:24.029
the agent who led us to
Tamazaki in the first place.

01:09:24.031 --> 01:09:26.157
Well, my daughter has
refused to cooperate.

01:09:26.158 --> 01:09:27.825
Still, she gave Sydney Tamazaki's name.

01:09:27.826 --> 01:09:30.621
If she were apprised of the
situation, she might help.

01:09:30.703 --> 01:09:33.203
I'll make her help. Where is she?

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:37.085
Hola?

01:09:37.086 --> 01:09:39.379
This is Michael Vaughn. I'm in Rio.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.089
Sydney's in trouble.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:42.090
Is it Vadik?

01:09:42.091 --> 01:09:44.050
Vadik and Tamazaki are the same person.

01:09:44.051 --> 01:09:46.261
Look, we don't know if Sydney's
still alive, but if she is,

01:09:46.261 --> 01:09:48.761
you're her only hope.

01:09:50.975 --> 01:09:53.475
Nadia, please.

01:09:53.978 --> 01:09:58.899
Tamazaki used to run an operation
near the Catedral Metropolitana.

01:09:59.149 --> 01:10:01.649
Okay, I'll need details.

01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:17.791
Sydney Bristow.

01:10:19.253 --> 01:10:21.753
What happened to the deal?

01:10:22.673 --> 01:10:25.173
What?

01:10:26.677 --> 01:10:31.140
What happened to the deal?

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.110
Before you leave this room,

01:10:45.446 --> 01:10:47.530
you will tell me why.

01:10:47.531 --> 01:10:49.240
I might.

01:10:49.241 --> 01:10:51.741
I'm relatively open-minded.

01:10:54.371 --> 01:10:57.208
But in this case, I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:11:01.587 --> 01:11:03.421
Have you eaten breakfast?

01:11:03.422 --> 01:11:05.215
Why? You want to grab something?

01:11:05.216 --> 01:11:07.716
You probably ate breakfast.

01:11:09.261 --> 01:11:11.596
Just in case,

01:11:11.597 --> 01:11:14.097
we'll wait.

01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:16.704
It's been three months.
What happened to you?

01:12:17.329 --> 01:12:20.666
It took longer then I thought
to find your birthday present.

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:52.823
I saw you standing in the park.

01:12:53.198 --> 01:12:56.202
I was looking for the woman
who stole the Shintaro, and

01:12:56.327 --> 01:12:59.246
then I saw you, and I knew...

01:13:00.456 --> 01:13:02.956
this wasn't about the sword.

01:13:04.251 --> 01:13:06.879
So now you found out...

01:13:07.129 --> 01:13:09.629
about the hit.

01:13:12.092 --> 01:13:15.763
Which means you must
know why you were spared,

01:13:15.804 --> 01:13:19.516
why the job went away.

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:47.042
I told you, I don't know about any hit.

01:13:52.841 --> 01:13:55.341
You wouldn't be here if you
didn't know about the contract.

01:14:00.349 --> 01:14:02.849
What contract?

01:14:05.813 --> 01:14:09.692
The contract I had on your life.

01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:13.111
You were hired to kill me?

01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:15.612
Who hired you?

01:14:16.115 --> 01:14:17.740
Sydney...

01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:20.241
assassin/client privilege.

01:14:20.744 --> 01:14:23.539
The day before the job,
my client was killed.

01:14:23.664 --> 01:14:25.498
Most unfortunate...

01:14:25.499 --> 01:14:27.333
for me.

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:30.421
I swear to god, I don't
know anything about this.

01:14:38.929 --> 01:14:41.429
Somehow I believe you.

01:14:42.224 --> 01:14:46.896
I guess this was just
one of those coincidences.

01:14:47.062 --> 01:14:49.562
Guess I can just sell
you the sword and go home.

01:14:51.066 --> 01:14:53.566
I'll just take the sword.

01:14:53.944 --> 01:14:56.444
How's that?

01:15:20.012 --> 01:15:21.971
So, Nadia, the tranquilizer lips...

01:15:21.972 --> 01:15:23.264
do you think it was too red?

01:15:23.265 --> 01:15:24.891
Does Jorge have the key card?

01:15:24.892 --> 01:15:27.392
Got it.

01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:35.567
I'm in.

01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:51.207
You'll be okay.

01:15:53.546 --> 01:15:56.046
Nadia.

01:16:04.598 --> 01:16:06.891
Sydney!

01:16:06.892 --> 01:16:09.392
Sydney!

01:16:21.115 --> 01:16:23.615
- Where's Sydney?
- She went that way.

01:16:58.569 --> 01:17:01.069
I was told you were good.

01:17:56.544 --> 01:17:59.044
Who hired you?

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.760
Who put a contract on my life?

01:18:08.472 --> 01:18:10.972
Who hired you?

01:18:16.438 --> 01:18:18.938
Derevko.

01:18:20.985 --> 01:18:23.571
Irina Derevko.

01:18:33.247 --> 01:18:35.747
Congratulations.

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:38.458
We recovered the isotope,

01:18:38.752 --> 01:18:41.252
we've eliminated a dangerous enemy,

01:18:41.714 --> 01:18:43.673
and the British
government is most grateful

01:18:43.674 --> 01:18:47.011
for American assistance in
returning the Shintaro sword.

01:18:50.055 --> 01:18:52.555
I would also like to announce that

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.186
Nadia has accepted my
offer to join A.P.O.

01:18:56.770 --> 01:19:00.608
I know that she can rely on your full
support in the days and weeks ahead.

01:19:00.691 --> 01:19:02.567
So,

01:19:02.568 --> 01:19:03.818
that's it.

01:19:03.819 --> 01:19:06.319
Go home.

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:08.905
Feel good about what you've done.

01:19:29.261 --> 01:19:31.596
How did you find out?

01:19:31.597 --> 01:19:33.264
Tamazaki.

01:19:33.265 --> 01:19:35.765
He had the contract.

01:19:44.026 --> 01:19:46.526
You didn't know?

01:19:47.363 --> 01:19:51.325
I merely knew your mother had
hired someone. I didn't know who.

01:19:52.868 --> 01:19:55.368
I had only one way to stop him.

01:19:56.497 --> 01:19:58.997
Why would she want me dead?

01:20:04.463 --> 01:20:06.963
I don't know.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.140
You killed her to save me.

01:20:17.768 --> 01:20:20.268
You killed mom

01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:23.521
to save me.

01:20:29.446 --> 01:20:31.946
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:21.246
Syd.

01:21:28.047 --> 01:21:29.130
Syd, are you okay?

01:21:29.131 --> 01:21:31.631
Yeah.

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:54.070
Thank you.

01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:12.758
See, I just... I don't see
it. You working at a bank?

01:22:12.967 --> 01:22:14.926
Come on, what kind of
job is that, you know?

01:22:14.927 --> 01:22:17.427
Cashing checks and making change.

01:22:17.513 --> 01:22:18.930
"Excuse me, next in line, please. "

01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:20.223
I'm a loan officer.

01:22:20.224 --> 01:22:22.100
I travel. Service accounts.

01:22:22.101 --> 01:22:24.352
Wait a minute, the cover
job you had for SD-6?

01:22:24.353 --> 01:22:25.687
- I happen to be good at it.
- Great.

01:22:25.688 --> 01:22:29.525
That's stimulating stuff.
Watching someone else's cash.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:34.071
Syd, come on, seriously, since you
left the spy biz, you are a bore.

01:22:34.196 --> 01:22:35.363
It's an adjustment, is all.

01:22:35.364 --> 01:22:36.906
Are you sure you don't
want to stay for dinner?

01:22:36.907 --> 01:22:39.407
I'd love to, but I gotta save the world.

01:22:39.785 --> 01:22:41.828
See ya.

01:22:41.829 --> 01:22:44.329
Bye.

01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:47.041
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:22:47.042 --> 01:22:50.629
I'm, uh, Eric Weiss, 38, single.

01:22:50.796 --> 01:22:52.714
- Nadia.
- How are you?

01:22:52.715 --> 01:22:55.008
Good. Is this a bad time?

01:22:55.009 --> 01:22:57.678
Not at all. Nadia, this is
Eric. He was just leaving.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.220
No, no, no. I can stay.

01:23:00.723 --> 01:23:02.473
Or go. Nice to meet you.

01:23:02.474 --> 01:23:04.893
You too.

01:23:04.894 --> 01:23:08.063
- Hey.
- What's going on?

01:23:12.359 --> 01:23:14.859
I just couldn't wait.

01:23:14.904 --> 01:23:17.404
Even until tomorrow.

01:23:20.951 --> 01:23:23.746
I was hoping we could
talk about our mother.

01:23:30.085 --> 01:23:32.585
Did you bring your passport?

01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:48.519
Our mother was killed.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:51.148
I found her body in a
state medical facility.

01:23:51.357 --> 01:23:53.859
I identified her, paid for her release.

01:23:53.943 --> 01:23:58.572
Made arrangements with a mausoleum in
Moscow three blocks from where she was born.

01:23:58.697 --> 01:24:01.197
I thought she'd want it that way.

01:24:22.054 --> 01:24:25.474
And you have no idea
who was responsible,

01:24:25.641 --> 01:24:28.141
who killed her?

01:24:30.437 --> 01:24:32.937
No.

01:24:36.026 --> 01:24:38.111
I swear to god,

01:24:38.112 --> 01:24:42.658
somehow I will find out who
did this to our mother...

01:24:44.618 --> 01:24:47.118
and I will kill him.

01:24:48.247 --> 01:24:50.747
I will.

01:24:56.747 --> 01:24:56.748
