01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.269
WE'RE RELYING
ON A SMACK ADDICT.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.303
TERRIFIC.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.339
OOH.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.342
HEY! I'M SORRY
I'M LATE, MAN.

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:41.677
I FELL ASLEEP
AT THE BUS STATION.

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:43.146
Stokes:
LOOKIN' GOOD, BUGGY.

01:19:43.146 --> 01:19:43.980

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:46.049
EXCUSE ME IF
I SMELL LIKE PISS.

01:19:46.049 --> 01:19:48.184
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:50.353
GOD HELP US.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:54.157
YOU WANT
A DRINK, BUGGY?

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.791
VODKA.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.526
I DO THIS THING
TONIGHT

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.295
AND THE SPOT
IS MINE, RIGHT?

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:00.997
WITH A BOW ON IT.

01:20:00.997 --> 01:20:02.065
LOOK, THE THING IS,

01:20:03.366 --> 01:20:06.970
I MEAN, THE RHINO IS UP

01:20:11.707 --> 01:20:13.910
[SNORING]

BUGGY?

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.981

01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:21.650
YEAH, MAN. SURE.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:24.353
WOW, LOOK AT ALL
THE PRETTY LIGHTS.

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:26.856
EVERY COP IN NEW YORK
IS LOOKING FOR YOU.

01:20:26.856 --> 01:20:28.224
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO STAY PUT FOR A WHILE.

01:20:28.224 --> 01:20:30.626
I WANTED TO BE
A PRIEST, ANGIE.

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:32.095
I KNOW, RANDY.

01:20:32.095 --> 01:20:34.197
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN ANGELS?

01:20:34.197 --> 01:20:34.998
ANGELS?

01:20:34.998 --> 01:20:38.034
I SAW ONE
IN TIMES SQUARE.

01:20:38.034 --> 01:20:41.104
THIS LITTLE ANGEL
WITH CURLS.

01:20:41.104 --> 01:20:44.107
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT CARED ABOUT ME.

01:20:44.107 --> 01:20:46.209
SHE SAVED MY LIFE.

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:48.311
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KILL YOURSELF, RANDY.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:49.879
YOU KNOW THAT.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:53.849
PERHAPS IT'S TIME
TO HEAL...

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:56.152
ADMIT THAT SMOOCHY
HAS WON,

01:20:56.152 --> 01:20:58.221
AND GRACEFULLY
MARCH FORWARD.

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:00.323
NOW YOU'RE
TALKIN', KID.

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:02.658
THIS IS A BIG STEP.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:08.464
OH, MAY I HAVE

01:21:08.464 --> 01:21:10.299
FOR A SMILE.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.669

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:15.004

01:21:15.004 --> 01:21:16.072
I GOT YOU SOME
CROSSWORD PUZZLES

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:17.640

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:31.120
[SIGHS]

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.722

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.058
[LAUGHS]

01:21:35.058 --> 01:21:37.126

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.196

01:21:40.196 --> 01:21:42.665
CALM DOWN, RANDY. SHE'S

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:04.787
WHAT HAPPENED TO GRACEFULLY

[HUMMING]
Buggy: YEAH.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:21.004
CAN I HELP YOU

01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:23.339
I GOT NEWS, NORA.

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:24.307

HEH HEH. WHAT ARE

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:32.481
I GOT BUSINESS

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:33.682
OH, YEAH?

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:34.950
YEAH.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.819
HE'S GONNA PUT ME

01:22:36.819 --> 01:22:38.354
HE'S GONNA

01:22:38.354 --> 01:22:40.956
I'M GONNA TAKE

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.491
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:45.361
BUGGY DING-DONG
SHALL RISE AGAIN

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.430
LIKE A MAGNIFICENT
PHOENIX

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.632
OR SOME OTHER TOWN

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:50.699
[LAUGHING]

01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:54.470

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:56.572
LET ME SHOW YOU
MY BUGGY BUMPER.

01:22:56.572 --> 01:22:59.042
HEY, BACK OFF, DRACULA!

Nora: I'M TELLING YOU,

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:07.583
STOKES CUT SOME KIND
OF DEAL WITH BUGGY

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:08.417
FOR THE SMOOCHY SLOT.

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:10.386
WAIT A MINUTE.
BUGGY DING-DONG,

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:12.321
THE HOST OF
BUGGY'S BUMPY RAILROAD?

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:13.856
YEAH, UNTIL
HE DISCOVERED THE JOYS

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:15.291
OF TURKISH
BLACK MULE HEROIN.

01:23:15.291 --> 01:23:16.559
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:18.594
WHY WOULD STOKES WANT
TO REPLACE SMOOCHY

01:23:18.594 --> 01:23:19.595
WITH SOME SMACK ADDICT?

01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:21.030
I DON'T KNOW.

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:23.832

WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:56.232
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU
OF THE LOVE WE ONCE HAD?

01:23:56.232 --> 01:23:58.301

01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:00.369

YET EXPERIMENTAL.

ARE YOU TELLING ME
THIS IS TRUE?

01:24:34.137 --> 01:24:35.504
I GOT MR. BOOMY, MISSY!

JINGLE JACKSON, TOO?

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:43.979

TO PLAY WITH HIS BELLS.

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:44.980
OH.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:47.316
WHAT ABOUT
WALLY THE WHALE?

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:50.119

OH, LISTEN, SHELDON,

01:24:59.027 --> 01:25:00.963
BUT...

01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:03.632
THERE WAS
A TIME IN MY LIFE...

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:06.502
WHEN I WAS A BIT

01:25:06.502 --> 01:25:08.704
OH, MY GOD.

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:14.977
THAT WAS ANOTHER TIME.
I WAS ANOTHER WOMAN THEN.

YOU'VE SHOWN ME
A WORLD THAT...

01:25:17.045 --> 01:25:19.782
I NEVER THOUGHT
COULD EXIST.

OF THE POWER

01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:35.298
OF A CONDEMNED MAN?

01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:36.532
TAKE IT EASY, RANDOLPH.

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:38.201
I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO HURT ANYONE HERE.

01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:40.436
OH, GO BLOW

OH!

01:37:33.148 --> 01:37:34.382
YOU OK?
I DON'T KNOW.

01:37:34.382 --> 01:37:35.750
I'M KIND OF FUCKED UP
IN GENERAL,

01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:37.585
SO IT'S HARD TO GAUGE.

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:38.586

IT'S BURKE!

HE TRIED TO KILL YOU!

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:45.027
OH, THERE HE IS!

01:37:45.027 --> 01:37:46.561
HE'S GETTING AWAY!
SHELDON!

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:47.862
BURKE!

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:48.863
NO!

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:50.798
SHELDON!
BURKE!

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:52.901
BURKE,
GET BACK HERE!

01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:08.716
Woman:
LOOK, IT'S SMOOCHY!

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:10.085
BURKE!

01:38:11.453 --> 01:38:13.621
Man: HEY, IT'S SMOOCHY.
THAT'S SMOOCHY.

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:14.722
Sheldon: STOP HIM!

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:17.259
Man: LOOK, HONEY, SMOOCHY!

01:39:03.905 --> 01:39:05.673
OHH! UHH!

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:09.911
UHH!

01:39:09.911 --> 01:39:11.046
OHH!

01:39:11.046 --> 01:39:13.015
YOU PULL A GUN ON ME?

01:39:13.015 --> 01:39:15.117
A GUN I GAVE YOU
AS A GIFT?

01:39:15.117 --> 01:39:17.385
WHERE'S YOUR ETIQUETTE?

01:39:17.385 --> 01:39:19.154
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE
SECRET ABOUT OWNING A GUN.

01:39:19.154 --> 01:39:20.722
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S THAT?

01:39:20.722 --> 01:39:22.790
YOU HAVE TO COCK IT.

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.959
DROP IT, SHITHEAD!

01:39:34.202 --> 01:39:35.437
DON'T YOU MOVE!

01:39:35.437 --> 01:39:36.238
SHELDON...

01:39:36.238 --> 01:39:38.473
YOU OK?
YEAH.

01:39:39.641 --> 01:39:40.675
YOU...

01:39:40.675 --> 01:39:41.943
TAKE IT EASY.

01:39:41.943 --> 01:39:43.911
YOU WERE MY AGENT.

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:45.747
HOW COULD YOU
SET ME UP LIKE THAT?!

01:39:45.747 --> 01:39:46.748
IT WAS JUST
CIRCUMSTANCES--

01:39:46.748 --> 01:39:47.882
CIRCUMSTANCES?!

01:39:47.882 --> 01:39:49.351
YOU KILLED SPINNER, BURKE!

01:39:49.351 --> 01:39:51.286
IT WAS A TRAGIC MISTAKE.

01:39:51.286 --> 01:39:53.021
I WISH I COULD
TURN BACK TIME.

01:39:53.021 --> 01:39:55.090
HE WAS MY FRIEND,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:56.658
SHELDON!

01:39:56.658 --> 01:39:57.892
GET UP!

01:39:57.892 --> 01:39:59.194
GET UP
AND LOOK AT ME!

01:39:59.194 --> 01:40:01.363
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
SHOOT ME?

01:40:01.363 --> 01:40:02.330
YEAH.

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:03.431
THAT'S NOT VERY
SMOOCHY-LIKE BEHAVIOR.

01:40:03.431 --> 01:40:05.500
I DON'T FEEL
VERY SMOOCHY-LIKE

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.235
RIGHT NOW, BURKE.

01:40:07.235 --> 01:40:08.803
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, SHELDON--

01:40:08.803 --> 01:40:10.438
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:40:10.438 --> 01:40:12.774
YOU JUST FUCKED
WITH THE WRONG RHINO, PAL.

01:40:12.774 --> 01:40:13.908
SHELDON, NO!

01:40:13.908 --> 01:40:15.009
SHELDON, HALT!

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:16.878
DON'T DO IT, SHEL!

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:20.248
TOMMY, STAY OUT OF THIS.
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

01:40:20.248 --> 01:40:21.916
Tommy: DON'T DESTROY
WHO YOU ARE

01:40:21.916 --> 01:40:24.086
FOR THIS PIECE OF SHIT.

01:40:27.889 --> 01:40:29.691
GIVE ME THE GUN, SHEL.

01:40:31.893 --> 01:40:34.696
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT AM I DOING?

01:40:34.696 --> 01:40:36.831
COME ON, NOW.

01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:37.832
THAT'S IT.

01:40:37.832 --> 01:40:39.634
Sheldon: I'M SORRY, TOMMY.

01:40:39.634 --> 01:40:42.204
I DON'T KNOW HOW I LET
MYSELF GET PUSHED SO FAR.

01:40:42.204 --> 01:40:46.941
YOU'RE ONLY HUMAN, DARLING.
COME ON. LET'S GO AWAY.

01:40:46.941 --> 01:40:47.942
THAT'S IT.

01:40:47.942 --> 01:40:49.244
OH, GOD!
AHH!

01:40:49.244 --> 01:40:50.845
Sheldon: WHAT SHOULD WE
DO ABOUT THESE GUYS?

01:40:50.845 --> 01:40:52.013
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT THEM.

01:40:52.013 --> 01:40:53.548
WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM.
OFF YOU GO.

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:55.317
YOU SURE? YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO ANYTHING

01:40:55.317 --> 01:40:56.684
TOO EXTREME, NOW,
ARE YOU, TOMMY?

01:40:56.684 --> 01:40:59.087
EVEN A RAT DESERVES
A LITTLE MERCY NOW AND AGAIN.

01:40:59.087 --> 01:41:00.088
OFF YOU GO.

01:41:00.088 --> 01:41:01.289

01:41:04.326 --> 01:41:06.428
WE'RE IN DEEP SHIT.
