00:02.575 --> 00:03.575
I'm Andre!

00:03.577 --> 00:04.576
And I'm Russell!

00:04.578 --> 00:08.747
And welcome to another episode
of Ménage à Cinq Video Blog!

00:09.917 --> 00:11.416
Not another one of these.

00:11.418 --> 00:12.917
How many of these videos
are they gonna make?

00:12.919 --> 00:15.253
Whether you want to enjoy a
romantic Pinot with your lover...

00:15.255 --> 00:18.256
...or a rowdy round of Riesling
with your racquetball team...

00:18.258 --> 00:20.959
...we think you'll find this
place has the perfect terroir.

00:20.961 --> 00:23.929
But don't worry, we're not pretentious--
<i> Non, non, non, non,</i>

00:23.931 --> 00:25.096
<i>non!</i>

00:25.098 --> 00:26.598
How many takes
do you think that took?

00:26.600 --> 00:27.432
It took 13.

00:27.434 --> 00:28.600
How do you know?

00:28.602 --> 00:29.801
I directed it.

00:29.803 --> 00:31.436
No expense was spared.

00:31.438 --> 00:34.606
We installed these old bank
fixtures to turn this wine bar

00:34.608 --> 00:38.531
into an old bank, which we then
turned back into a wine bar!

00:38.651 --> 00:42.152
That seems unbelievably
expensive and unnecessary.

00:42.154 --> 00:44.822
By the way-- did I tell you guys
I'm thinking of buying a giraffe.

00:44.824 --> 00:48.525
One of the number-one problems in the
restaurant business today is when you're

00:48.527 --> 00:51.495
sitting in a booth, what do
you do with your elbows?

00:51.497 --> 00:54.531
Well, at Ménage à Cinq, we
spared no expense in inventing

00:54.533 --> 00:56.366
the leather elbow rester.

00:56.368 --> 00:58.736
#patentpending.

00:58.738 --> 01:02.206
You know he got that sweatshirt,
just so he could say "hashtag."

01:02.208 --> 01:05.409
And for private events, we have
our own special wine room.

01:05.411 --> 01:08.545
And our unisex toilets mean even
more opportunity to mingle.

01:08.547 --> 01:10.547
#makefriendsonthetoilet.

01:10.549 --> 01:12.416
#partywhileyoupoop.

01:12.418 --> 01:15.719
If this wine bar were a first-round
pick, it would be Ryan Leaf.

01:15.721 --> 01:16.754
Or Jamarcus Russell.

01:16.756 --> 01:17.721
What's that?

01:17.723 --> 01:21.058
You want some adventurous single-vineyard
selections from around the globe?

01:21.060 --> 01:22.226
Oh, we got that.

01:22.228 --> 01:26.063
Andre also found these super-cool
antique wine implements.

01:26.065 --> 01:29.433
Don't tell anyone, but they're actually
18th-century gynecological tools.

01:29.435 --> 01:30.601
Ew.

01:30.603 --> 01:33.270
Well, if it's cork versus
speculum-- cork, you're going

01:33.272 --> 01:34.938
down...

01:34.940 --> 01:36.607
#tuesdayniteisladiesnite.

01:36.609 --> 01:39.443
#comeondown.

01:39.445 --> 01:40.944
Congratulations, Andre.

01:40.946 --> 01:41.945
You ruined wine.

01:41.947 --> 01:43.947
I'd rather talk to
people about their kids.

01:43.949 --> 01:44.782
You know what?

01:44.784 --> 01:47.451

You're on my team.

02:03.925 --> 02:05.258
Yeah, no, I-I got caught up.

02:05.260 --> 02:06.092
Sorry.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.369
Russell's team is really good.

02:16.371 --> 02:17.537
Andre's killing it, too.

02:17.539 --> 02:18.771
Yeah, of course he is.

02:18.773 --> 02:22.208
He picked up all of our players after
the incidents with the Washingtons.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.609
Trade of Tears.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.945
I would trade them back
Manhattan for those players.

02:25.947 --> 02:30.082
In spite of that, I still snuck out a
victory, thank you to my lucky jersey.

02:30.084 --> 02:33.886
You're gonna need a lot more than your
lucky jersey next week, "Matt Farté."

02:33.888 --> 02:35.888
You're playing me, and the
winner goes to the playoffs.

02:35.890 --> 02:36.722
Mm!

02:36.724 --> 02:37.723
Yeah, no kidding.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.559
I need to squeak out against
this shit-sipper over here.

02:39.561 --> 02:40.560
What about me?

02:40.562 --> 02:41.394
Did I make the playoffs?

02:41.396 --> 02:43.229
No, you and Chuck
are out, buddy.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.397
Whew! What a relief.

02:44.399 --> 02:46.566
I'm gonna need all the time I
can get to fix up my new house.

02:46.568 --> 02:47.733
What?!

02:47.735 --> 02:48.568
What?!

02:48.570 --> 02:51.237
I wanted to wait until all the
papers were signed but, as

02:51.239 --> 02:54.740
of today, it is official: Taco
over here is a homeowner.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.410
Did you buy yourself a "Live
Not Work" space in the city?

02:57.412 --> 03:01.581
No, I decided to leave downtown and join
my brother and his girlfriend in the

03:01.583 --> 03:02.582
"slum-burbs."

03:02.584 --> 03:03.416
Well, great.

03:03.418 --> 03:05.918
Now you can gather up all your
stuff and get it out of my house.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.919
No, I'm still gonna
need the storage space.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.857
You think I'd store
that junk in my house?

03:13.261 --> 03:14.961
Ah.

03:14.963 --> 03:16.262
Huh?!

03:16.264 --> 03:17.597
What?!

03:18.967 --> 03:22.935
I go into the bathroom, the toothbrush
is sitting there on the metal thing.

03:22.937 --> 03:24.470
I'm, like, how does that happen?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.772
Is it a guy brushing his teeth
in an office bathroom, who has

03:26.774 --> 03:29.475
no control over his
gastrointestinal issues, so he

03:29.477 --> 03:32.111
goes to the bathroom and
keeps brushing his teeth?

03:32.113 --> 03:34.614
Or is it a time management
issue, where you're, like, "I

03:34.616 --> 03:36.449
gotta make the most out of my
day, so I'm gonna brush my teeth

03:36.451 --> 03:37.450
while I blow foam."

03:37.452 --> 03:38.618
I don't get it.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.452
What's the problem?

03:39.454 --> 03:41.655
The problem is don't bring
anything that you're going to

03:41.656 --> 03:43.522
put into your mouth
into a bathroom stall.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.192
Well, add toilet-brushing to the list of
things that you are passionate about.

03:46.194 --> 03:48.160
That, and limited the
number of add/drops.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.529
There should be unlimited
add/drops in our league!

03:50.565 --> 03:52.532
No, that's a battle
for another day.

03:52.534 --> 03:54.500
Right now, I just want to know
what animal would do this.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.668
Enough out of you, Ruxin.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.336
Taco, what's going on
with the new place?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.337
When can we see it?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.039
Well, there's still some work
that has to get done, but I'll

04:00.041 --> 04:01.674
have you guy over
when it's ready.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.842
Good.

04:02.844 --> 04:05.010
You know, actually, I have
a place opening up, too.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.846
Ménage à Cinq is gonna be the
best place to watch the games.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.716
Look, you guys want gluten-free
and vegan snacks, we got 'em.

04:10.718 --> 04:13.386
You know, I have a little bit of a
gluten allergy, so it's sort of a...

04:13.388 --> 04:15.555
Oh, could you stop with the
gluten shit, Yeast Mode?

04:15.557 --> 04:17.557
Oh, you can call me Yeast
Mode all you want.

04:17.559 --> 04:18.724
I don't see it as an insult.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.726
I wear it as a badge of honor.

04:21.896 --> 04:24.230
That's right, Yeast Mode's
in the playoffs, y'all!

04:24.232 --> 04:26.399
I think I'm developing
an Andre intolerance.

04:26.401 --> 04:28.901
I decided to just cut out all
conversations about gluten,

04:28.903 --> 04:31.070
'cause even though I'm not
allergic to it, I just feel

04:31.072 --> 04:33.139
better when I don't have them.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.747
Gross.

04:44.886 --> 04:51.791
♪ Ruxin and Big Rod All ready to pee
Nobody here but you and me... ♪

04:55.730 --> 04:58.669
What is up, buddy?

04:58.830 --> 05:00.429
What are you doing, Chaps?

05:00.431 --> 05:02.165
Going to the bathroom.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.499
There's no divider here.

05:03.501 --> 05:04.333
Oh, it doesn't matter.

05:04.335 --> 05:05.334
Come on...

05:05.336 --> 05:06.836
Oh, my God!

05:06.838 --> 05:09.105
I assume that you
were just peeing?

05:09.107 --> 05:11.440
That's part of it.

05:12.443 --> 05:13.209
Oh, you're a creep!

05:13.211 --> 05:15.111
Disgusting!

05:15.113 --> 05:16.112
Hey, hey, hey!

05:16.114 --> 05:17.112
Wash your hands!

05:17.114 --> 05:17.613
Wash your dead tooth.

05:17.615 --> 05:18.614
I tried that!

05:18.616 --> 05:20.116
It doesn't help!

05:20.118 --> 05:21.951
Chaps, with the dead tooth?

05:21.953 --> 05:22.952
Mm-hmm.

05:22.954 --> 05:24.787
You want me to fire him
because he took a dump?

05:24.789 --> 05:27.456
No, I want you to fire him because
he took a dump in front of me.

05:27.458 --> 05:28.291
It's a public bathroom.

05:28.293 --> 05:30.126
No, it's a one-person bathroom.

05:30.128 --> 05:31.127
With two facilities.

05:31.129 --> 05:33.796
Yeah, but there's no divider,
so I gotta look at it.

05:33.798 --> 05:37.300
You know the thing: "If there isn't
a divider, stand outside 'er."

05:37.302 --> 05:38.134
That's not a real thing.

05:38.136 --> 05:40.636
I'm working on making
it a real thing, okay?

05:40.638 --> 05:41.804
I need your support on this.

05:41.806 --> 05:43.139
It's disgusting!

05:43.141 --> 05:46.309
You want to look another man in
the eye while he takes a grumper?

05:46.311 --> 05:47.977
I'm saying I'm not afraid to.

05:47.979 --> 05:49.979
I'm saying I've done it before,
whether it's lacrosse, or

05:49.981 --> 05:52.014
a fraternity initiation...
Look, Bethesda, there are

05:52.016 --> 05:54.684
certain things that
separate us from animals.

05:54.686 --> 05:56.495
One: we learn to farm.

05:56.615 --> 05:58.548
Two: we have cable TV.

05:58.550 --> 06:01.718
And three: we don't shit and
look at other people in the eyes

06:01.720 --> 06:03.219
while we're doing it, okay?

06:03.221 --> 06:06.389
You want to look a guy in the eye
while he's taking a shit, like a dog?

06:06.391 --> 06:09.259
You know how embarrassed dogs look
when they're shitting in front of you?

06:09.261 --> 06:10.894
Their arched backs, and they're
looking at you, they got fear in

06:10.896 --> 06:13.897
their eyes, and when they're done, they
scrape around in dirt, so that's...

06:13.899 --> 06:15.098
You know what?

06:15.100 --> 06:18.635
I guarantee you that Chaps is
the Toilet Toothbrush Bandit.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.078
What toothbrush?

06:20.080 --> 06:24.416
I was in the bathroom recently, and there
was a toothbrush sitting on top of

06:24.418 --> 06:25.918
a toilet paper dispenser.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.754
Is this why you have been calling
people into your office,

06:28.756 --> 06:31.757
asking them all kinds of weird
questions, instead of doing your

06:31.759 --> 06:33.425
Chevron depositions?

06:33.427 --> 06:36.662
I am working on the Chevron
case, but I am also working on

06:36.664 --> 06:38.263
the toilet toothbrush case.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.132
Just do your job.

06:40.134 --> 06:43.101
Sometimes you've gotta take a
stand and say: That's not right!

06:43.103 --> 06:44.436
We are corporate lawyers.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.939
We absolutely never
ever say that!

06:46.941 --> 06:49.274
I'm telling you, it's
that dead-tooth ginger.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.443
Wait, wait, wait-- hold on.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.778
How do you open Excel?

06:52.780 --> 06:53.779
Just open Microsoft Office.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.780
Yep.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.614
Okay.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.683
Hey, do me a favor--
send that kid in here.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.218
I'll call Ganesh.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.653
Hey, Tiny.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.488
Just a salad today?

07:02.490 --> 07:03.655
Yeah, it's boring as shit.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.491
They gave me some extra bread
sticks, if you want one.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.492
You know, I can't.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.494
I've been having stomach issues,
so I went to the doctor, and he

07:08.496 --> 07:10.162
thinks I might have
a gluten allergy.

07:10.164 --> 07:10.996
Oh!

07:10.998 --> 07:11.997
You mean like Andre?

07:11.999 --> 07:14.833
No, no, no, no-- we are not
telling Andre about this.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.170
I can't have any bonding
moments with Andre, especially

07:18.172 --> 07:20.472
one that is centered around
meals and has no end in sight.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.640
No, it's the worst.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.642
Yeah, "Bond-dre" is horrible.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.211
I remember, in high school, when
he found out we both peeled

07:26.213 --> 07:28.146
our bananas from the bottom...
You remember that?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.848
Yeah, you guys were,
uh, "banana twins."

07:29.850 --> 07:32.017
No, no, no, he wanted to call
us "the Banana Bottom Boys."

07:32.019 --> 07:33.118
Oh...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.687
He was talking about t-shirts
and hats-- I would have had to

07:35.689 --> 07:36.688
switch high schools.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.457
This is what I'm talking about.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.691
I cannot become a gluten buddy.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.527
I do not want to be
GFF's with Bond-dre.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.194
Deal.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.195
Yeah.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.196
You know what?

07:44.198 --> 07:46.198
I think I'm developing
a citrus allergy.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.033
Every time I eat oranges, the
orange goes down fine, but the

07:48.035 --> 07:51.103
peels just sit there
in my stomach.

07:52.038 --> 07:56.542
So what you see before you are three
different types of wine decanters.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.144
I'm trying to figure out which
one would fit perfectly on the

07:59.146 --> 08:00.918
tables at Ménage à Cinq.

08:01.038 --> 08:04.234
Kudos to you, Andre, because you
are committing everything to

08:04.236 --> 08:07.570
this wine bar-- your money, your
time, your personal collection

08:07.572 --> 08:11.741
of butt plugs... Okay... these are not
butt plugs, they are decanters, thank

08:11.743 --> 08:13.576
you very much.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.078
Now let's do the sniff test.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.915
This one, you can hold by the shaft...
But you're still gonna want

08:18.917 --> 08:20.250
to tickle it from the base.

08:20.252 --> 08:23.086
Well, no, if you actually cup the
bottom, you're gonna heat up

08:23.088 --> 08:24.920
the good stuff, and you
don't want to do that.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.923
Yeah, then the wine will just spill
out all over the place too quickly.

08:26.925 --> 08:28.091
Exactly.

08:28.093 --> 08:31.594
This one has a much smaller
shaft, which I like, but, um...

08:31.596 --> 08:33.596
I'll be honest-- I'm
a big-shaft man.

08:33.597 --> 08:34.429
Mm-hmm.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.432
That's interesting because,
while this one has the smallest

08:36.433 --> 08:39.434
shaft, it has a nice grip, which
would allow for turning just for

08:39.437 --> 08:40.503
the customer's extra pleasure.

08:40.505 --> 08:43.273
This one seems more
appropriate for group parties

08:43.275 --> 08:45.141
'cause you can get more hands
on there, and then, you know,

08:45.143 --> 08:46.143
everyone's working it in.

08:46.144 --> 08:47.110
It's a party experience.

08:47.112 --> 08:48.111
Okay, you know what?

08:48.113 --> 08:50.113
This is not going up
anyone's asshole.

08:50.115 --> 08:52.115
So, then, what are
we doing here?

08:52.117 --> 08:54.150
We're trying to pick a decanter.

08:54.152 --> 08:55.151
Sniff away.

08:55.153 --> 08:56.153
I'm getting another beer.

That a Heisler?

09:13.898 --> 09:15.531
Jesus, Andre.

09:15.533 --> 09:16.365
What do you want?

09:16.367 --> 09:17.533
Gluten-free beer.

09:17.535 --> 09:18.534
Well, well, well, Pete.

09:18.536 --> 09:19.701
Welcome to the tribe.

09:19.703 --> 09:20.702
Is this gluten-free?

09:20.704 --> 09:21.403
You know what?

09:21.405 --> 09:22.204
Maybe I need glasses.

09:22.206 --> 09:23.772
Hey, you don't need glasses.

09:23.774 --> 09:24.907
You're gluant.

09:24.909 --> 09:26.241
Gluant?

09:26.243 --> 09:27.543
Gluten-intolerant.

09:27.545 --> 09:28.377
I am not.

09:28.379 --> 09:29.545
This was just... just a mistake.

09:29.547 --> 09:31.046
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.214
We'll be GFFs.

09:32.216 --> 09:33.248
We're not GFFs.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.552
I want to hold hands with you...
No.

09:36.554 --> 09:38.720
...and walk into bakeries and
tell everyone what they're doing

09:38.722 --> 09:39.721
to their bodies is poison.

09:39.723 --> 09:40.589
Think about it.

09:40.591 --> 09:41.723
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Pete.

09:41.725 --> 09:43.759
What are you drinking my
father-in-law's beer for, huh?

09:43.761 --> 09:45.761
That's your... your
father-in-law's beer?

09:45.763 --> 09:46.762
It was an accident.

09:46.764 --> 09:48.764
I thought I was
getting a Peroni.

09:48.766 --> 09:49.598
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.599
I must have been mistaken, then.

09:50.601 --> 09:52.601
I thought you guys
were part of the club.

09:52.603 --> 09:53.602
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:53.604 --> 09:54.603
I love bread.

09:54.605 --> 09:56.271
I mean, I won't eat it if it
doesn't have bread in it.

09:56.273 --> 09:57.106
This shit pig?

09:57.108 --> 09:57.773
He lives in a bakery.

09:57.775 --> 09:58.607
Yeah.

09:58.609 --> 09:59.608
Oh, all right.

09:59.610 --> 10:03.612
I guess I'll see you
grain brains later.

10:03.614 --> 10:05.280
Oh, thank God.

10:05.282 --> 10:06.448
Wow.

10:06.450 --> 10:07.583
Oh, my God.

10:07.585 --> 10:08.417
I owe you big-time.

10:08.419 --> 10:09.151
Yeah, you think?

10:09.153 --> 10:10.252
You almost walked into that.

10:10.254 --> 10:11.086
I'm so scared.

10:11.088 --> 10:11.987
I love you so much.

10:11.989 --> 10:12.754
Ew, squish.

10:12.756 --> 10:13.589
Come on, come look at this.

10:13.591 --> 10:14.423
Oh.

10:14.425 --> 10:15.257
You got to see this.

10:15.259 --> 10:16.458
All right. Sorry.

10:16.460 --> 10:17.626
Move, move, move, move.

10:17.628 --> 10:19.561
Andre, move your butt
plugs out of the way.

10:19.563 --> 10:21.296
They're not butt plugs.

10:21.298 --> 10:25.801

Hi, guys.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.202
Taco, what are you doing?

12:31.204 --> 12:32.036
Did you start a brothel?

12:32.038 --> 12:33.037
What?

12:33.039 --> 12:34.706
The EBDBBnB is not a brothel.

12:34.708 --> 12:37.375
It's a bed-and-breakfast

12:37.377 --> 12:38.209
That is a brothel.

12:38.211 --> 12:40.211
At least I'm not opening a
wine bar like some idiot.

12:40.213 --> 12:41.045
Ha!

12:41.047 --> 12:42.046
You guys should come by.

12:42.048 --> 12:44.215
Sofia's gonna be making
her world-famous chorizo.

12:44.217 --> 12:46.718
What? She hasn't made me
that chorizo in years.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.720
She makes it for me every week.

12:48.722 --> 12:49.721
It's amazing.

12:49.723 --> 12:51.723
Uh, there are gonna
be tons of people.

12:51.725 --> 12:52.724
We're gonna watch the games.

12:52.726 --> 12:53.725
Gonna be food and everything.

12:53.727 --> 12:54.726
What do you guys say, huh?

12:54.728 --> 12:55.693
EBDBBnB this weekend.

12:55.695 --> 12:56.527
No, no, no, no, no.

12:56.529 --> 12:58.529
We already agreed that we were
gonna watch the games at Ménage

12:58.531 --> 12:59.263
à Cinq this weekend.

12:59.265 --> 13:00.264
I already planted my flag.

13:00.266 --> 13:03.101
We're opening this weekend, so a lot of
people will be planting their flags.

13:03.103 --> 13:06.404
I mean, actually a lot of you guys
will be at Ménage à Cinq, right?

13:06.406 --> 13:09.173
Uh... Uh... Right.

13:09.175 --> 13:09.907
I'll see you guys Sunday.

13:09.909 --> 13:11.075
Jenny, I need to talk to you.

13:11.077 --> 13:11.843
I need your help.

13:11.845 --> 13:13.511
Oh, yeah, you thinking
about franchising?

13:13.513 --> 13:15.513
No, no, no, it's just, BnBs
are usually run by really old

13:15.515 --> 13:17.515
lesbians, and you're the
oldest lesbian I know.

13:17.517 --> 13:18.416
I'm not an old lesbian, Taco.

13:18.418 --> 13:20.418
I bet Becky from field
hockey would disagree.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.419
Will you quit it?

13:21.421 --> 13:24.422
Well, I need a lesbian to run this
thing, and Andre's busy this weekend.

13:24.424 --> 13:25.423
No.

13:25.425 --> 13:27.425
By the way, can I borrow
those butt plugs?

13:27.427 --> 13:28.426
They're not butt plugs.

13:28.428 --> 13:30.428
This is for wine,
not for assholes.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.497
You're holding it.

13:34.826 --> 13:36.827
Yeah, egg salad sandwich
on pumpernickel.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.328
Extra egg, extra mayo.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.330
Bye.

14:01.853 --> 14:03.020
Aha!

14:03.022 --> 14:04.714
I caught you, Chaps.

14:04.983 --> 14:06.149
Injecting insulin?

14:06.151 --> 14:07.484
Huh? You're diabetic?

14:07.486 --> 14:09.319
Yes, asshole.

14:09.321 --> 14:12.505
Cool. Cool, cool.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.324
You're weird.

14:14.326 --> 14:15.900
- Mm-hmm.
- Stop being weird.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.461
I'm the weird one?

14:17.463 --> 14:20.440
This guy is not locking the door
when he goes to the bathroom.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.798
That is weird.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.799
It's a two-person bathroom.

14:22.801 --> 14:23.800
Bingo.

14:23.802 --> 14:24.968
There's no divider.

14:24.970 --> 14:26.803
It's not a two-person bathroom.

14:26.805 --> 14:28.138
What do you want, man?

14:28.140 --> 14:32.342
What I want is to not look another man
in the eyes while he's taking a grumper.

14:32.344 --> 14:34.978
Have you never been
initiated to something?

14:34.980 --> 14:36.146
Exactly.

14:36.148 --> 14:38.815
No, I save my homoerotic
stuff for message boards.

14:38.817 --> 14:40.217
You serious?

14:40.219 --> 14:41.518
I mean like fantasy football.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.354
Like, "I'm gonna stuff that in him,"
"he's getting stuffed by that guy."

14:44.356 --> 14:45.355
Oh, yeah, no, no, I get it.

14:45.357 --> 14:46.356
That's good stuff.

14:46.358 --> 14:48.191
Okay, great, so I want to
launch a formal investigation

14:48.193 --> 14:50.694
into the Toilet Toothbrush
Bandit because, I'm telling you,

14:50.696 --> 14:55.232
the Tooth Scary here is brushing his
teeth while he's dropping grumpers off.

14:55.234 --> 14:56.433
That's never gonna happen.

14:56.435 --> 15:01.371
What you need to do is apologize
to Chaps and his tooth.

15:01.373 --> 15:03.574
I'm sorry.

15:03.576 --> 15:07.044
I'm gonna need a medium if I'm
going to apologize to that tooth

15:07.046 --> 15:08.045
'cause it's so dead.

15:08.047 --> 15:09.212
Ah.

15:09.214 --> 15:11.548
Do you think the lawyers for
those indigenous people down in

15:11.550 --> 15:13.584
the Amazon are goofing
around like this?

15:13.586 --> 15:15.752
I guarantee they're dealing
with plumbing issues.

15:15.754 --> 15:17.921
Do your job or I'll
send you back to Korea.

15:17.923 --> 15:19.256
Got that, Ke-Mo Sah-Bee?

15:19.258 --> 15:20.591
Do your job, "Kemma Sibby."

15:20.593 --> 15:21.925
That's not even Korean.

15:21.927 --> 15:23.260
It's...

15:23.262 --> 15:24.595
Oh, my God.

15:24.597 --> 15:25.596
Hey, Rux.

15:25.598 --> 15:26.763
Yeah, I'll call Ganesh.

15:26.765 --> 15:29.600
Thank you.

15:29.602 --> 15:31.101
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop.

15:31.103 --> 15:35.272
No, no, no, no, no, no washing my
lucky jersey during the playoff push.

15:35.274 --> 15:36.273
What?

15:36.275 --> 15:38.408
This baby's got
to stay pristine.

15:38.410 --> 15:40.744
Pristine was about
five exits back, babe.

15:40.746 --> 15:41.578
That thing is filthy.

15:41.580 --> 15:42.913
Filthy? No.

15:42.915 --> 15:44.748
This thing is covered in luck.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.617
Is that what you're calling it?

15:46.619 --> 15:48.619
Because, to me, it looks a
whole lot like mustard.

15:48.621 --> 15:49.720
That's what luck is.

15:49.722 --> 15:52.556
Luck is comprised of mustard,
ketchup, tears and blood.

15:52.558 --> 15:53.790
For a hot dog vendor.

15:53.792 --> 15:55.892
This thing's gonna help
me win it all this year.

15:55.894 --> 15:57.794
And when I do... Hey, guys.

15:57.796 --> 15:59.963
No, Taco, you cannot
take our stuff.

15:59.965 --> 16:00.964
No, this is my stuff.

16:00.966 --> 16:01.965
I'm moving out of this shithole.

16:01.967 --> 16:02.799
Really?

16:02.801 --> 16:03.800
What?

16:03.802 --> 16:05.802
Don't worry, I'm still gonna
come here for eating.

16:05.804 --> 16:06.737
Uh, can I get a hand?

16:06.739 --> 16:08.739
I have a lot of gizmos
to get out of here.

16:08.741 --> 16:09.740
Yes.

16:09.742 --> 16:11.642
See? Lucky jersey.

16:11.644 --> 16:13.207
What do we got?

16:13.327 --> 16:14.259
What?

16:14.261 --> 16:15.427
This was all in our attic?

16:15.429 --> 16:17.496
I'm gonna take all this stuff
with me, but I'm gonna leave

16:17.498 --> 16:20.132
some of the junk behind, like
the couch in the TV room.

16:20.134 --> 16:21.266
That's our couch.

16:21.268 --> 16:22.601
Here you go.

16:22.603 --> 16:24.770
My God, these are all condoms?

16:24.772 --> 16:25.771
Yeah.

16:25.773 --> 16:27.279
I need them for the EBDBBnB.

16:27.399 --> 16:29.399
A lot of people having
sex over there.

16:29.401 --> 16:30.400
Lambskin?

16:30.402 --> 16:31.401
Gross.

16:31.403 --> 16:34.404
No, no, no, they come the closest
to simulating unprotected sex.

16:34.406 --> 16:36.823
I think they're the closest thing
to having sex with a sheep.

16:36.943 --> 16:37.683
That is incorrect.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.409
Lambskin condoms are the best.

16:39.411 --> 16:41.744
And when you have sex as much
as I do, you want the best.

16:41.746 --> 16:45.415
It's like how it's okay to buy $300
sneakers if you're really into running.

16:45.417 --> 16:49.085
Exactly-- I don't just have sex for fun
on the weekends, like you guys do.

16:49.087 --> 16:51.254
Well, we don't have sex on the weekend, Mr.
Know-It-All,

16:51.256 --> 16:52.734
because she says I'm too tired.

16:52.854 --> 16:55.124
He's exhausted.

16:55.126 --> 16:56.493
Hey, Taco!

16:56.495 --> 16:59.762
Everyone's supposed to come over to my
wine bar, not go to your stupid place!

16:59.985 --> 17:03.600
Hey, man... what's your ass beating
on the damn door like that?

17:03.602 --> 17:04.467
What's wrong with you?

17:04.469 --> 17:05.435
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:05.436 --> 17:05.969
Marshawn, don't kill him.

17:05.971 --> 17:06.301
It's okay.

17:06.304 --> 17:07.301
Oh.

17:07.304 --> 17:08.104
He's unfortunately with me.

17:08.106 --> 17:09.105
Oh, this your boy, huh?

17:09.107 --> 17:10.807
How do you know Marshawn Lynch?

17:10.809 --> 17:13.108
Yeah, Marshawn's my silent
partner in the EBDBBnB.

17:13.111 --> 17:16.112
Yeah, the EBDBBnB is all
about that action, boss.

17:16.114 --> 17:18.448
It's funny, we have
a lot in common.

17:18.450 --> 17:21.784
You're "Beast Mode" and I'm...
Bam!

17:21.786 --> 17:22.452
Oh, here he goes.

17:22.954 --> 17:23.987
...Yeast Mode!

17:23.989 --> 17:25.821
What the hell is Yeast Mode?

17:25.824 --> 17:28.156
It's all about that
gluten-free action, boss!

17:28.159 --> 17:30.994
Andre, you're the last person who
should be talking about action.

17:30.996 --> 17:32.495
Oh, I get plenty of action.

17:32.497 --> 17:33.496
What kind of action?

17:33.498 --> 17:35.164
Hand action-- you know
what I'm talking about.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.199
Nah, that's not action.

17:36.201 --> 17:37.000
That's action.

17:37.002 --> 17:37.834
Not action.

17:37.836 --> 17:38.701
That is not action.

17:38.703 --> 17:40.036
Well, I get some mouth
action, too-- a little bit.

17:40.038 --> 17:41.837
Andre, it doesn't count if
you're doing it yourself.

17:41.839 --> 17:43.706
It does... it count... Tell him it
counts when you do it yourself.

17:43.708 --> 17:44.841
Hell, no!

17:44.843 --> 17:45.675
I don't know nothing about that.

17:45.677 --> 17:47.677
Okay, well, sometimes I do it
myself, but that's because of my

17:47.679 --> 17:50.513
yoga class is very intense,
it just slips in there.

17:50.515 --> 17:51.714
You're blaming this on yoga?!

17:51.716 --> 17:53.883
I don't swallow
'cause of the gluten.

17:53.885 --> 17:56.719
How do you know... Marshawn, if
you're good here, we gotta go.

17:56.721 --> 17:57.420
Oh, what about Sunday?

17:57.422 --> 17:58.521
Look, here's what I can do:

17:58.523 --> 18:01.558
for the morning games, people
will go to the wine bar, but the

18:01.560 --> 18:03.805
afternoon games are the EBDBBnB.

18:03.925 --> 18:05.425
Marshawn, you should come.

18:05.427 --> 18:06.426
It'll be fun.

18:06.428 --> 18:08.068
Ah, well, Sundays, I'm
a little busy, man.

18:08.111 --> 18:08.772
Doing what?

18:08.892 --> 18:11.017
Sunday, that's when I go ahead and go to...
No, this is what I'm talking

18:11.102 --> 18:13.436
about, Marshawn-- for a silent
partner, you sure do talk a lot.

18:13.438 --> 18:15.104
You just yap-yap, yap-yap,
yap all the time.

18:15.106 --> 18:16.877
Bro... Let's roll.

18:16.997 --> 18:18.830
Taco, man, I'm-a holla at you.

18:18.832 --> 18:19.664
Take care.

18:19.666 --> 18:20.999
See you, Marshawn.

18:21.001 --> 18:22.000
Yeast Mode, right?

18:22.002 --> 18:23.001
Stop embarrassing me.

18:23.003 --> 18:24.169
All right, Taco.

18:29.428 --> 18:33.116
Wow, I am honored that you guys
came here to watch the games.

18:33.236 --> 18:34.569
It means the world to me.

18:34.571 --> 18:35.904
What is this, Andre?

18:35.906 --> 18:37.071
I know.

18:37.073 --> 18:38.172
It's embarrassing.

18:38.174 --> 18:40.742
It's a Chardonnay bottle
with red wine in it-- blah.

18:40.744 --> 18:41.885
Yeah, that's what's
wrong with it.

18:41.992 --> 18:44.326
That's what I picture Rafi's
dick looking like-- blood

18:44.328 --> 18:46.995
squirting out the end and, like,
elephantitis of the balls.

18:46.997 --> 18:48.997
That is some fearless feedback.

18:48.999 --> 18:51.433
That's the benefit of
doing a soft opening.

18:51.435 --> 18:54.336
You know what's super-soft
is your lineup.

18:54.338 --> 18:57.339
I am projected to win
and I am thrilled.

18:57.341 --> 19:00.475
Well, you know, I just projected in the
third stall here at Ménage à Cinq.

19:00.477 --> 19:03.278
Just had the stinker-tinker
of a lifetime.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.112
Whoo! Feeling good.

19:04.114 --> 19:05.113
You are shit-pants.

19:05.115 --> 19:06.115
Oh, here comes some food.

19:06.116 --> 19:07.115
All right!

19:07.117 --> 19:10.783
I've got stuff that you guys are
gonna love-- especially you, Petey.

19:10.903 --> 19:12.736
So, I have some flatbread pizza;

19:12.738 --> 19:15.906
got a little bread bowl, with
some amazing clam chowder.

19:15.908 --> 19:17.574
These are all artisanal breads.

19:17.576 --> 19:19.075
That's a lot of bread.

19:19.077 --> 19:21.411
Well, just because I can't eat
bread doesn't mean I can't

19:21.413 --> 19:23.747
watch my friends enjoy some of
our amazing homemade creations.

19:23.749 --> 19:25.081
Mm-hmm!

19:25.083 --> 19:26.249
So, eat up!

19:26.251 --> 19:27.083
Try this garlic bread.

19:27.085 --> 19:28.084
It's supposedly delicious.

19:28.086 --> 19:29.084
Oh, looks delicious.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.085
Here, Kevin, there you go.

19:30.087 --> 19:30.920
Enjoy.

19:30.922 --> 19:31.587
You don't want any?

19:31.589 --> 19:32.588
Flatbread pizza?

19:32.590 --> 19:32.923
I'm gonna have some almonds.

19:32.925 --> 19:33.757
These look delicious.

19:33.759 --> 19:35.425
No, no, no, no--
what are you doing?

19:35.427 --> 19:36.426
You gotta try this.

19:36.428 --> 19:37.427
It's a homemade bread pudding.

19:37.429 --> 19:38.929
You're gonna love it.

19:40.265 --> 19:41.264
What's wrong?

19:41.266 --> 19:42.933
Come on, I thought
you loved bread.

19:42.935 --> 19:45.169
If you don't love bread and
you've got a gluten intolerance,

19:45.289 --> 19:48.812
you and Andre could be
GFF's-- Gluten Free Forever.

19:50.109 --> 19:51.182
I love bread.

19:51.419 --> 19:54.530
So shovel a spoonful
in your face-keister.

20:00.008 --> 20:01.976
There you go.

20:01.978 --> 20:03.311
It's good, right?

20:03.313 --> 20:05.379
Yeah.

20:09.605 --> 20:11.114
Why'd you eat the
whole thing, Pete?

20:11.235 --> 20:12.234
'Cause he loves it.

20:12.236 --> 20:13.902
Buddy, you don't look so good.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.404
You feeling all right?

20:15.406 --> 20:17.906
Could it be because my team
jumped out to an early lead, or

20:17.908 --> 20:20.909
could it be something
that you ate?

20:20.911 --> 20:24.246
Yeast mode...
What's that? Huh?

20:24.248 --> 20:26.115
Yeast mode...!

20:26.117 --> 20:27.283
Oh, God!

20:27.285 --> 20:28.617
Oh, my... oh...!

20:29.102 --> 20:30.902
Why didn't you vomit on Andre?

20:30.904 --> 20:32.070
Have you seen his outfit?

20:32.072 --> 20:33.404
It would've been redundant.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.073
GFF's!

20:35.075 --> 20:36.775
Oh, God!

20:38.245 --> 20:39.744
Oh, no!

20:39.746 --> 20:41.813
I feel better.

20:44.784 --> 20:47.952
Gupta, we need ice and
lube in 302, please.

20:47.954 --> 20:49.954
Oh, how's the chorizo
coming along, Sophia?

20:49.956 --> 20:50.789
It's almost ready.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.956
Looks fantastic.

20:51.958 --> 20:54.659
Okay...
Can't believe I lost.

20:54.661 --> 20:56.961
And I can't believe my
lucky jersey let me down.

20:56.963 --> 21:01.466
Can't believe you sat in that vomit-caked
lucky jersey for hours, Kevin.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.967
In hindsight, that
was a mistake.

21:02.969 --> 21:06.471
Ugh... I can't believe that you're
going to be Sacko president again.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.306
I know, it's like a run
unopposed every year.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.441
Gentlemen, please don't
fill up on the snacks.

21:10.443 --> 21:14.579
Sophia is making her world-famous
chorizo, and it is to die for.

21:14.581 --> 21:17.482
Compliments of the house, a
bottle of our Three Penis wine.

21:17.484 --> 21:20.318
It's technically a
Four Penis wine.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.199
Oh, just one moment, please.

21:22.319 --> 21:23.919
I apologize.

21:23.921 --> 21:25.242
Sundays are very
busy around here.

21:25.306 --> 21:26.371
What's the fourth penis?

21:26.491 --> 21:27.207
Ragu!

21:27.327 --> 21:28.068
Ugh.

21:28.707 --> 21:30.874
Well, speaking of, congrats on
making the playoffs again, Pete.

21:30.876 --> 21:31.541
Thanks, man.

21:31.543 --> 21:32.542
I'm psyched.

21:32.544 --> 21:33.376
Oh, Peter!

21:33.378 --> 21:35.545
Of course, it does
come at a cost.

21:35.547 --> 21:39.315
Got us some gluten-free
snacks for my new GFF.

21:39.317 --> 21:40.639
I'm not your GFF.

21:40.759 --> 21:43.927
GFF...
That's so cute, you guys.

21:43.929 --> 21:46.196
Come on, ride with me,
my Breadless Horseman.

21:46.198 --> 21:48.298
I really don't want to ride
with you anywhere, thank you.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.528
You want to <i> Lady and Tramp</i> it?

21:49.852 --> 21:54.404
- Geez... - I'm so sorry, the couple in
room 23 just put their "Disturb"

21:54.406 --> 21:56.540
sign out, so I'm going to
go have sex with them.

21:56.542 --> 22:00.377
Please remember to log all of your
sexual interactions while at the EBDB.

22:00.379 --> 22:01.711
Jenny, I'm looking at you.

22:01.713 --> 22:02.712
I'm good.

22:02.714 --> 22:05.382
Ooh! Sophia's world-famous
chorizo is served.

22:05.384 --> 22:06.716
World-famous chorizos!

22:06.718 --> 22:07.717
Ah! Chorizos!

22:08.720 --> 22:10.554
I'm not really hungry right now.

22:10.556 --> 22:12.222
Okay, so they might taste a
little different, 'cause I used

22:12.224 --> 22:14.224
Taco's casings, but
I hope you like it.

22:14.226 --> 22:15.392
Tell me what you think.

22:15.394 --> 22:16.726
Are these buns gluten-free?

22:16.728 --> 22:17.727
No,<i> maricón.</i>

22:17.729 --> 22:20.063
These look delicious.

22:20.065 --> 22:22.398
Anyone see my lambskin condoms?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.568
I washed them and hung them out
to dry, but now they're gone.

22:24.570 --> 22:25.402
What...?

22:25.404 --> 22:26.770
What?

22:26.772 --> 22:28.438
Oh, my... Oh...!

22:28.440 --> 22:29.406
Oh, my God!

22:30.409 --> 22:31.408
Oh, God, it's condom chorizo!

22:31.410 --> 22:34.244
Why would you take the condoms
out of the wrapper, Taco?

22:34.246 --> 22:34.945
Oh, my God!

22:34.947 --> 22:35.912
Because it's a hotel.

22:35.914 --> 22:37.414
People want clean sheets
and clean condoms.

22:37.416 --> 22:39.249
Taco, you don't wash condoms!

22:39.251 --> 22:41.284
This is a green establishment.

22:41.286 --> 22:43.086
We re-use our condoms!

22:44.089 --> 22:46.790
Oh, God! Oh, God!

22:46.792 --> 22:49.259
It would seem you people
were allergic to lambskin.

22:49.261 --> 22:51.928
God, I taste it!

22:51.930 --> 22:54.364
Look, geez, that looks great.

22:54.366 --> 22:55.832
Mmm! Mmm!

22:56.668 --> 22:59.703
They're world-famous for
a reason, Sophia-- mmm!

23:05.015 --> 23:09.952
Ah... ah... Couldn't get the taste
of condom chorizo out of my mouth.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.756
Oh, God...

23:16.026 --> 23:23.900
Oh, God, okay, okay, oh, God... Oh, God...
Oh, Ruxin... What?!

23:23.902 --> 23:25.282
You hypocrite.

23:25.402 --> 23:26.401
It's not what you think.

23:26.403 --> 23:29.404
You spend all this company
time yammering on about

23:29.406 --> 23:32.073
toothbrushes and toilets, and
you're doing the exact same thing!

23:32.075 --> 23:33.074
It's not my fault!

23:33.076 --> 23:34.242
I had the condom chorizo!

23:34.244 --> 23:35.743
What is that-- Korean?

23:35.745 --> 23:37.578
Can't even understand you, man.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.580
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be good.

23:39.582 --> 23:40.915
What are you doing?

23:40.917 --> 23:41.916
Two-man bathroom, bro.

23:41.918 --> 23:46.921
Ugh... Hey... Ew...
Check this out.

23:46.923 --> 23:47.921
What?!

23:47.923 --> 23:48.756
It was you all along?

23:48.758 --> 23:50.458
That's right.

23:51.294 --> 23:53.227
Oh...

23:53.229 --> 23:55.062
Oh... oh...!

23:55.064 --> 23:56.564
Oh, that's good.

23:56.566 --> 23:58.099
That's the stuff.

23:58.101 --> 23:59.600
All right, now push it! Focus!
