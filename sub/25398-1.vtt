00:06.247 --> 00:07.945
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
There we go.

00:07.947 --> 00:09.615
No, no, no, let's not...

00:09.617 --> 00:10.851
Take your shirt off, little boy.

00:11.251 --> 00:12.287
Oh, yeah.

00:13.553 --> 00:15.623
- Okay, this is...
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

00:15.989 --> 00:18.760
- I just needed the toilet.
- Just pee your pants.

00:20.327 --> 00:21.459
- Stop it.
- Oh, yeah.

00:21.461 --> 00:22.461
- No.
- Yes!

00:22.463 --> 00:23.828
- No.
- Yes!

00:25.598 --> 00:26.934
You shut up, you baby.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.635
Yeah. Shut up! Shut up!

00:29.903 --> 00:31.035
Oh, here, look at the butterfly.
You gotta look at the butterfly.

00:31.037 --> 00:32.703
Now look at the butterfly.
Now look at the butterfly.

00:32.705 --> 00:33.971
Look at the butterfly.
Oh!

00:33.973 --> 00:36.642
Ooh, look at the butterfly.
Ooh!

00:36.644 --> 00:39.681
<i>For the record,
I did not sign up for this.</i>

00:40.580 --> 00:43.751
<i>This is not the sort of situation I
would typically choose to be in.</i>

00:44.851 --> 00:46.584
<i>Just thought
that you should know that.</i>

00:48.055 --> 00:49.223

<i>Hello there, I'm Elliot.</i>

01:46.613 --> 01:48.548
<i>This is my village. In England.</i>

01:49.682 --> 01:51.885
<i>It all started one summer.</i>

01:52.786 --> 01:57.425
<i>I'd just graduated university and I
had to move back in with my mother.</i>

02:05.899 --> 02:08.303
<i>I was having a bit of a
tough time finding a job.</i>

02:09.902 --> 02:11.638
<i>Oh, and I was recently dumped.</i>

02:13.741 --> 02:16.043
<i>So, yeah, the first days of adult
life were looking promising.</i>

02:18.578 --> 02:21.079
Wakey-wakey,
hands off your snakey.

02:21.081 --> 02:22.583
I'm not... Mom, morning.

02:23.983 --> 02:26.854
You're not looking at those
smutty sites, are you?

02:27.053 --> 02:30.588
Like FuckTube and YouTug.

02:30.590 --> 02:32.793
Ugh. No. Why have you even
heard of things like that?

02:33.059 --> 02:35.629
There's a better girl out there for
you, darling. Don't you worry.

02:36.830 --> 02:39.164
I always thought Alison
was a bit of a whore anyway.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.501
Mom!

02:40.733 --> 02:42.536
Just a mother's intuition.
Anyway...

02:43.636 --> 02:47.474
I want to tell you that I've
met a lovely American chap.

02:47.673 --> 02:50.477
- What?
- Yes. At the convention in Chicago.

02:50.910 --> 02:54.579
We met in the bar and he bedded
me in his room that night.

02:54.581 --> 02:56.684
- And I'm going to marry him.
- What?

02:56.916 --> 02:58.817
Now, don't get over-excited.

02:58.819 --> 03:00.685
I'm not getting over-excited,

03:00.687 --> 03:03.555
I'm just hoping this is a joke
or something.

03:03.557 --> 03:06.027
- A weird joke.
- Honestly.

03:06.860 --> 03:10.528
He's the first man since your father
left to make me feel pleasure.

03:10.530 --> 03:12.497
That's completely unnecessary.

03:12.499 --> 03:13.931
Honestly, I've been
craving a man.

03:13.933 --> 03:15.599
Then please stop
being honest, Mom.

03:15.601 --> 03:17.971
He's a lovely chap,
you're going to really like him.

03:19.071 --> 03:20.171
Is he here?

03:20.173 --> 03:22.039
Oh, no,
you're going to meet him.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.541
What are you on about?

03:23.543 --> 03:25.112
He's bought you a ticket.

03:25.779 --> 03:27.081
- Where?
- To America.

03:27.748 --> 03:29.080
- Really?
- Yes.

03:29.082 --> 03:31.883
- Where?
- Bismarck, North Dakota.

03:31.885 --> 03:33.451
Oh, where the hell is that?

03:33.453 --> 03:35.687
Well, now,
I've heard it's a lovely place.

03:35.689 --> 03:38.556
They call it
"The Orlando of the North."

03:38.558 --> 03:41.193
Without the Disneyland or the
tropical weather, of course.

03:41.195 --> 03:43.228
- What?
- So, you'll stay there for a while,

03:43.230 --> 03:46.164
I'll be here
and wrap up stuff at work

03:46.166 --> 03:50.004
and then join you on the weekend
for our little wedding.

03:50.570 --> 03:51.671
<i>This</i> weekend?

03:52.773 --> 03:54.605
Darling, if you don't like it,
you don't have to move.

03:54.607 --> 03:55.574
Mom, this is...

03:55.576 --> 03:57.545
What's the harm in going
and meeting everyone?

03:57.910 --> 04:00.981
I understand American girls
quite like a British accent.

04:01.648 --> 04:02.713
I have something for you.

04:02.715 --> 04:05.584
Oh, my God. Gross.

04:05.586 --> 04:08.189
- Well, now hang on.
- Why are there so many of them as well?

04:11.658 --> 04:12.957
Would you like
to see a photo?

04:12.959 --> 04:13.694
No.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.529
Here's my Romeo.

04:17.129 --> 04:20.634
- Oh, my good God, Mom.
- His name is Michaelson.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.069
- What? Michael?
- Son.

04:22.703 --> 04:23.871
- Son?
- Michaelson.

04:24.136 --> 04:25.903
Michaelson?
What sort of a name is that?

04:25.905 --> 04:27.838
Oh, don't be silly, darling,
please.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.509
He's got two lovely sons.

04:29.742 --> 04:32.644
Sean, the accountant,
and Joey.

04:32.646 --> 04:34.745
I hear he's a bit
of a character.

04:34.747 --> 04:38.051
- It'll be the start of a new chapter...
- I don't care.

04:38.251 --> 04:40.117
Mom, I want nothing to do
with these people.

04:40.119 --> 04:41.721
I am not going.

04:44.857 --> 04:46.557
<i>Welcome to North Dakota,</i>

04:46.559 --> 04:48.629
<i>the least visited state
in America.</i>

05:05.078 --> 05:06.247
Not so fast, slick.

05:06.747 --> 05:08.616
- I beg your pardon?
- Pardon yourself, assface.

05:08.982 --> 05:10.150
Freak out
and I'm going to homicide you.

05:10.984 --> 05:12.053
Now, walk and act casual.

05:12.886 --> 05:13.987
Come on.

05:14.554 --> 05:15.622
Come on.

05:16.256 --> 05:17.859
- Keep it fucking moving.
- Okay.

05:20.893 --> 05:22.829
Hello, guv'nor!

05:23.196 --> 05:25.967
Me name is Winston Churchill.

05:26.199 --> 05:28.766
Welcome to America.

05:28.768 --> 05:31.235
The fucking US of A!

05:31.237 --> 05:32.937
Wolverine isn't English, moron.

05:32.939 --> 05:34.773
Yeah, but
Hugh Jackson is, you dumbass.

05:34.775 --> 05:36.975
Dude, you got his name wrong,
and he's Australian.

05:36.977 --> 05:38.776
He's not from Austria, you tool.

05:38.778 --> 05:43.982
Will you two blokes
stop cunting about, eh?

05:43.984 --> 05:45.887
A little creepy?
A little creepy with the masks?

05:47.720 --> 05:48.956
Off with your heads, then!

05:51.824 --> 05:52.893
Oh, yeah.
Hey. Michaelson.

05:53.326 --> 05:55.093
How are you doing, eh?
This here's Sean.

05:55.095 --> 05:56.627
I begged them not to do it.

05:56.629 --> 05:58.031
What up, dude? I'm Joey.

05:58.631 --> 06:00.098
But my friends call me
"Young Joseph."

06:00.100 --> 06:01.298
Dude, nobody calls you that.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.735
- Shut up.
- Hey, you like the OG shit?

06:03.737 --> 06:05.739
You like the OG shit.
Huh, El, you like the OG shit?

06:08.141 --> 06:09.110
All right.

06:10.744 --> 06:12.143
All right.
That's how we like it.

06:12.145 --> 06:13.114
That's how we roll.

06:13.780 --> 06:15.215
- It's great.
- Yeah.

06:16.883 --> 06:18.115
You know what?
Never mind that.

06:18.117 --> 06:19.317
Nah, let's get going.

06:21.321 --> 06:22.920
Do you want the Beatles?
Do you want that?

06:22.922 --> 06:23.790
- You want the Beatles?
- Okay.

06:40.706 --> 06:42.876
So it's a
three-bedroom casa upstairs,

06:43.343 --> 06:46.211
so you'll be crashing here
in my dojo down here. Yeah.

06:46.213 --> 06:48.178
And I hope you don't mind
the girls being in here,

06:48.180 --> 06:49.680
'cause they love Joe's room.

06:49.682 --> 06:50.951
- Oh, the cats?
- Yeah.

06:51.184 --> 06:53.187
I'm actually
slightly allergic.

06:53.653 --> 06:55.088
What? Holy shit!

06:55.321 --> 06:56.387
I gotta get the girls
out of here!

06:56.389 --> 06:58.325
It's not...
It doesn't really matter, but...

06:58.725 --> 06:59.790
It's a mild allergy.

06:59.792 --> 07:02.326
Look, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

07:02.328 --> 07:04.095
Consider this
an official apology, okay?

07:04.097 --> 07:05.829
- Okay.
- We had no idea.

07:05.831 --> 07:07.031
We're all cat lovers here.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.999
That's Princess over there.

07:09.001 --> 07:10.838
This is Cosby. This was before Cosby
did all that shit, I named it.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.971
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

07:12.973 --> 07:14.338
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.940
My mom actually gave me
allergy medicine, so...

07:16.942 --> 07:19.343
Your mom is an angel sent
directly from God's bosom.

07:19.345 --> 07:21.314
- Directly! Directly!
- Directly.

07:23.984 --> 07:25.716
- I like techno.
- Okay.

07:25.718 --> 07:28.786
I love hip-hop,
I like... I like kale,

07:28.788 --> 07:32.692
I like Uber X, I like social
medias, I like all that shit, El!

07:32.925 --> 07:35.360
I'm telling ya, if you're
thinking I'm some kind of weirdo,

07:35.362 --> 07:37.932
I'm a...
I'm actually pretty cool.

07:38.264 --> 07:40.066
- I'm pretty cool.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:42.836 --> 07:43.804
I think I'm...

07:44.804 --> 07:45.903
I think I'm pretty nervous.

07:45.905 --> 07:46.870
Is the cat okay?

07:46.872 --> 07:48.173
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:48.175 --> 07:49.110
Yeah, I think he went to the bathroom.
I gotta go.

07:54.146 --> 07:55.315
Really beautiful house.

07:55.881 --> 07:57.684
Oh, yeah, did my dad
set you up okay?

07:59.186 --> 08:01.920
Yes. I'm in the sort of Asian-inspired
room. I've got my own punch bag and...

08:01.922 --> 08:03.023
- Right. The dojo.
- Yeah.

08:03.223 --> 08:04.822
Sorry about the cats.
Um...

08:04.824 --> 08:07.225
Ever since our mom died,
my dad's been really into them.

08:07.227 --> 08:08.062
Oh.

08:08.828 --> 08:09.761
Sometimes he just tries
too hard.

08:09.763 --> 08:12.062
I just think he really wants you
to like him.

08:12.064 --> 08:13.333
So, what's up, are you in
a costume or some shit?

08:14.367 --> 08:16.468
- Dude...
- I'm just saying.

08:16.470 --> 08:17.772
We need to make him look less like
Doctor Who before the trip. That's all.

08:19.073 --> 08:21.305
I just... I wasn't really sure
what was appropriate to wear in...

08:21.307 --> 08:23.307
I can dress you in my threads if
you're cool with the smell of pussy,

08:23.309 --> 08:24.377
because they be covered
in that shit, yo.

08:26.345 --> 08:27.148
He's a moron.

08:28.982 --> 08:30.115
So, you just graduated college?

08:30.117 --> 08:31.415
Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.686
Oh, cool,
did you go to Hogwarts?

08:34.285 --> 08:35.121
You see...

08:35.921 --> 08:36.956
Total moron.

08:37.789 --> 08:38.725
Okay.

08:39.859 --> 08:42.192
All right.
You dudes better be hungry.

08:42.193 --> 08:43.995
Get out of here.

08:43.996 --> 08:45.996
Ah. Yeah.

08:45.998 --> 08:48.201
Oh, wait, pizza's here.
All right!

08:48.901 --> 08:51.771
Hey, El,
they got pizza in the UK?

08:53.039 --> 08:54.775
- Uh, yup.
- Cool.

08:55.074 --> 08:57.310
- Awesome.
- Hi, guys.

08:58.210 --> 08:59.110
Hey!

08:59.112 --> 09:01.846
- Hey!
- Hey, all right!

09:01.848 --> 09:02.849
- Okay.
- Yay.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.416
- Hi, I'm Skylar.
- Hi. Elliot.

09:05.418 --> 09:07.254
Oh. Nice to meet you.

09:08.221 --> 09:10.491
This must be so crazy for you,
coming out here to meet these guys.

09:11.091 --> 09:12.791
Uh... Yeah, a bit.

09:14.394 --> 09:15.328
Yeah,
that looks good.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.064
After you.

09:19.199 --> 09:20.300
Oh. Thanks.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.400
Oh,
wait, wait, wait!

09:23.402 --> 09:24.838
I got something for you, El.

09:25.838 --> 09:27.907
- A little English food, huh?
- Oh.

09:28.809 --> 09:29.477
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh.

09:32.145 --> 09:33.948
Your tea and crumpets, sir.

09:35.147 --> 09:37.517
- Thanks.
- Yes, of course. My pleasure.

09:37.950 --> 09:39.252
- Looks great.
- Like you never left home, right?

09:42.088 --> 09:43.488
Are you guys excited
for the road trip?

09:43.490 --> 09:45.023
Fuck, yeah!
Fucking road trip, baby.

09:45.025 --> 09:46.557
Hey, are Amy and Shu driving
with you?

09:46.559 --> 09:48.525
Yeah, and some girl from work
wants to come.

09:48.527 --> 09:49.763
Oh, yeah,
I bet she wants to come.

09:51.397 --> 09:53.030
Atta boy, Joey.

09:54.467 --> 09:57.000
- Joey! Right?
- Whoo, whoo, whoo.

09:57.002 --> 10:00.206
Sniff it. Yeah. Yeah.

10:01.040 --> 10:01.975
That's my boy.

10:03.010 --> 10:06.076
So... Sorry, what is it
that we're doing, exactly?

10:06.078 --> 10:08.245
Oh, it's alumni weekend at
our college in Colorado.

10:08.247 --> 10:10.148
Yeah, my frat is throwing
a fucking rager.

10:10.150 --> 10:14.085
Yeah. Listen, after dinner, why
don't you guys pop a few brewskis,

10:14.087 --> 10:17.258
fill El in on the road trip, and
then I'm gonna hit the dojo.

10:19.192 --> 10:21.262
Right after this, I'm gonna
give Sean a little ass-pounding

10:21.527 --> 10:23.062
in a game called
"Ass-pounding."

10:24.064 --> 10:24.998
You guys got that in the UK?

10:26.065 --> 10:27.066
- No.
- You're gonna...

10:27.333 --> 10:28.334
You're gonna pound me
in the ass?

10:29.902 --> 10:30.802
The fuck you trying
to say?

10:30.804 --> 10:32.202
You just said you were gonna
pound my ass.

10:32.204 --> 10:33.840
That's your new family.

10:34.074 --> 10:35.639
- Don't even think about it.
- I'm not gay.

10:35.641 --> 10:37.341
Pound, pound, pound,
pound, pound, pound, pound...

10:37.343 --> 10:38.845
Oh.

10:39.346 --> 10:40.280
Pound, pound, pound,
pound, pound!

10:42.147 --> 10:44.249
So, I thought you and Sean were,
like, boyfriend and girlfriend.

10:44.251 --> 10:46.187
- Gross, no.
- You're gross.

10:46.585 --> 10:47.587
I just grew up next door.

10:48.255 --> 10:49.888
They're like my brothers.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.356
But you all ended up going
to the same university?

10:52.358 --> 10:54.994
Yeah, we wanted to get away from Bismarck.
Shocker, huh?

10:55.227 --> 10:58.897
Joey had Van Wilder complex, so we
all graduated about the same time.

10:58.899 --> 11:00.367
- I can hear you.
- You know it's true.

11:01.901 --> 11:03.167
Sean hates his job

11:03.169 --> 11:05.606
and Joey's just living at home,
doing this.

11:06.673 --> 11:08.940
All he ever talks about
is the fraternity still.

11:08.942 --> 11:10.240
This trip's gonna be
good for them.

11:10.242 --> 11:12.879
Well, I think life after uni
can be a bit tough.

11:13.146 --> 11:14.582
- You know?
- Oh, yeah?

11:15.281 --> 11:16.547
Well, maybe this will be good
for you, too.

11:16.549 --> 11:18.383
Oh.

11:18.385 --> 11:20.384
What's up, sluts? Just kidding.
It's a thing...

11:20.386 --> 11:23.587
- Fridge!
- Okay, so this is Daniel.

11:23.589 --> 11:26.124
They call him "Fridge"
because he's big

11:26.126 --> 11:28.293
or eats out of a fridge a lot
or something? I don't know.

11:28.295 --> 11:30.064
- Okay.
- Who's this guy?

11:30.597 --> 11:33.199
Uh... Fridge, Elliot.
Elliot, Fridge.

11:33.433 --> 11:34.400
Hello.

11:35.367 --> 11:36.337
I work for the US government.

11:40.372 --> 11:41.507
- Right.
- What do you do?

11:42.574 --> 11:48.046
Um... I'm kind of in-between...
jobs at the moment.

11:48.048 --> 11:49.980
- Yeah, "funemployed."
- Yeah.

11:49.982 --> 11:51.515
You don't work for the
US government, Fridge.

11:51.517 --> 11:52.585
You're a meter maid.

11:53.085 --> 11:56.089
Parking enforcement officer,
okay?

11:57.156 --> 11:58.722
Still working for
the government, Sean.

11:58.724 --> 11:59.990
Shut up, Fridge.

11:59.992 --> 12:01.127
You got it, bro.

12:02.628 --> 12:03.997
Do you want another beer?

12:04.430 --> 12:05.999
Yeah, but I'll get us one.
All right.

12:08.168 --> 12:10.304
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Yup, just another cat.

12:12.572 --> 12:13.407
It was a cat.

12:21.580 --> 12:22.982
- Morning, Dad.
- Whoo! New record.

12:26.251 --> 12:27.655
Road trip, motherfucker!

12:30.223 --> 12:32.525
I'm really not feeling very comfortable
in the clothing Joey's given me.

12:32.758 --> 12:34.427
I don't know, let me see. Spin.

12:35.627 --> 12:38.395
I see what you mean.
It's a little straightforward.

12:38.397 --> 12:41.034
I mean, I didn't go to their college,
but I sure do like to have fun.

12:41.434 --> 12:44.369
Like, on weekends, I'll wear a
shirt with a more humorous slogan,

12:44.371 --> 12:47.304
like, "I'm not as think
as you drunk I am."

12:47.306 --> 12:49.173
Oh, yes, very clever.

12:49.175 --> 12:51.210
Shut up, Fridge. It's a wonder
why he never gets laid.

12:51.611 --> 12:52.710
Morning, yo!

12:52.712 --> 12:54.644
Oh, hi.
I can carry that for you.

12:54.646 --> 12:55.982
Oh, no, you don't have to.

12:56.449 --> 12:58.115
Not a fan of the po-pos, huh?

12:58.117 --> 13:00.083
No, I would never usually
wear something like this.

13:00.085 --> 13:01.753
- Hey, when's the evil witch arriving?
- Stop!

13:01.755 --> 13:03.691
She's coming now.

13:04.089 --> 13:05.325
Hey!

13:05.791 --> 13:08.127
Let me out of this bento box.

13:10.396 --> 13:12.062
Road trip, bitches!

13:12.064 --> 13:13.199
- Fuck, yeah, bitches!
- Oh.

13:14.501 --> 13:17.034
So, Elliot,
this is Shu and that's Amy.

13:17.036 --> 13:18.369
We all went to college together.

13:18.371 --> 13:20.307
Oh. Hello, nice to meet you.
Elliot.

13:20.573 --> 13:21.307
Elliot!

13:23.410 --> 13:25.143
<i>E.T.,</i> that's a great film.

13:25.145 --> 13:26.510
He sounds weird.

13:26.512 --> 13:27.480
- Sorry.
- Hello, ladies.

13:29.314 --> 13:31.081
Let's get out of here
and ditch these losers.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.182
Okay.

13:32.184 --> 13:33.484
My friend will be here
in a minute.

13:33.486 --> 13:35.119
That's right, you got a
hot teacher chick coming.

13:35.121 --> 13:35.655
Who is she?

13:36.490 --> 13:37.455
She's the gym instructor
at my school.

13:37.457 --> 13:39.490
She's going through
a really bad breakup,

13:39.492 --> 13:41.525
so I thought she'd appreciate
some time away.

13:41.527 --> 13:42.762
She'll appreciate my crane.

13:43.829 --> 13:45.163
Come on, dude, no.

13:45.165 --> 13:47.264
She's got
a really cool personality.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.299
Yeah, that's code for pig.

13:49.301 --> 13:50.536
Guys, stop.
That's her right now.

13:57.276 --> 13:58.145
God fucking damn it!

13:59.679 --> 14:01.578
- Hi, friend!
- Oh, keep your distance.

14:01.580 --> 14:04.081
- Oh.
- Breakfast burrito's resting uneasy in my gut.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.118
Are you okay?

14:05.484 --> 14:06.285
We'll know in an hour,
won't we?

14:06.618 --> 14:07.618
What the fuck?

14:07.620 --> 14:09.155
This is Shu and Amy...

14:09.421 --> 14:10.822
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:10.824 --> 14:12.159
- ...and these are the guys.
- Hi, I'm Sean.

14:13.293 --> 14:14.028
Young Joseph.

14:14.626 --> 14:15.328
Fatima.

14:17.429 --> 14:18.596
- Who?
- Huh?

14:18.598 --> 14:19.732
- What's your name?
- Fatima.

14:22.669 --> 14:24.304
I'm Daniel.

14:24.636 --> 14:27.337
But people call me Fridge,
'cause I'm strong or something.

14:27.339 --> 14:28.405
It's whatever,
it's weird.

14:28.407 --> 14:29.609
- Cool name.
- Yeah?

14:30.510 --> 14:31.412
How do you do?
Elliot.

14:33.179 --> 14:34.581
- Brit, huh?
- Yup.

14:35.548 --> 14:37.051
- I bet you are.
- Okay.

14:37.449 --> 14:39.085
Um, we're gonna head out.

14:40.285 --> 14:42.289
I'm driving
and Skylar's shotgun.

14:42.755 --> 14:44.621
- See you guys on the road.
- Bye.

14:44.623 --> 14:46.691
- See ya. Bye.
- El, I wanna talk to you for a second.

14:46.693 --> 14:50.227
Hey, listen, I really appreciate you being
so cool about everything, you know?

14:50.229 --> 14:53.399
And I really love your mom and I know
we're gonna be a really happy family.

14:53.665 --> 14:55.501
- Okay.
- That being said,

14:56.301 --> 14:59.169
go out there and get
some American ass!

15:00.240 --> 15:01.442
Be safe, huh?

15:01.774 --> 15:03.710
Don't be late
to my motherfucking wedding.

15:04.176 --> 15:05.743
Yeah, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

15:05.745 --> 15:07.548
Road trip, bitches!

15:08.348 --> 15:12.582
Drugs and sex and fucking, sucking...

15:12.584 --> 15:14.487
Road trip it, motherfucker!

15:15.320 --> 15:17.423
Oh, yeah. Whoo.
They're gone.

15:18.424 --> 15:20.227
Got my run in, my shake.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.393
Jerk off.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.612
Dude, did you hear
what that girl's name was?

15:40.280 --> 15:40.780
Yeah.

15:41.381 --> 15:42.647
Yo, El, did you hear?

15:42.649 --> 15:43.813
Yeah, I heard.

15:43.815 --> 15:44.750
No, but did you
actually hear it?

15:45.517 --> 15:46.819
Yeah, I heard it.

15:47.386 --> 15:49.787
No, you don't get it.
It's "Fat-ima."

15:49.789 --> 15:52.590
She's fat and her name is...

15:52.592 --> 15:54.294
Fatima. I know. I got it.

15:54.493 --> 15:56.594
No, I don't think you pronounce
it like that, okay, guys?

15:56.596 --> 15:58.596
I think it's "Fa-tima."

15:58.598 --> 16:00.197
You know,
it's like a beautiful song.

16:00.199 --> 16:02.802
No way! It's "Fat-ima,"
but she's actually fat!

16:03.335 --> 16:04.170
You don't get it.

16:04.503 --> 16:05.735
No, I got it.

16:05.737 --> 16:07.273
- We got it.
- I fucking got it.

16:07.473 --> 16:08.572
Oh, you don't get it.

16:08.574 --> 16:09.709
- Yeah, we get it.
- We get it.

16:15.548 --> 16:18.381
We are taking a different
route to those idiots, right?

16:18.383 --> 16:19.817
There's really only one route.

16:19.819 --> 16:21.188
And they're great guys,
anyway.

16:22.588 --> 16:24.889
That English dude
seems kind of cute.

16:24.891 --> 16:26.626
Oh, yeah?
I guess he is kind of cute.

16:29.395 --> 16:30.297
A Brit fingered me once.

16:31.863 --> 16:32.732
No complaints.

16:36.301 --> 16:38.769
All right, we gotta swing
by Kush's yard and get rigged up.

16:38.771 --> 16:39.772
Yeah.

16:40.707 --> 16:42.309
- Wait, what does that mean?
- Marijuana.

16:43.376 --> 16:44.475
Oh.

16:44.477 --> 16:46.244
I don't think
we have time, guys.

16:46.246 --> 16:48.479
We should just keep driving.
Just keep on driving.

16:48.481 --> 16:50.480
- No, this party's gonna be a rager.
- Yeah. Honk, honk!

16:50.482 --> 16:51.919
We gotta do shit right.

16:52.751 --> 16:54.784
I'm not showing up
empty-handed.

16:54.786 --> 16:57.455
Yeah, look, I... I don't wanna be the
sort of party pooper or whatever.

16:57.457 --> 16:59.322
I'm not really comfortable
with the whole drugs thing,

16:59.324 --> 17:00.423
you know,
it's not really my thing.

17:00.425 --> 17:01.926
I've just applied
for a job and...

17:01.928 --> 17:04.627
No, fuck that! We're gonna rage
like true frat stars, all right?

17:04.630 --> 17:06.963
We're gonna get you some Smir
to get things started,

17:06.964 --> 17:08.898
some brewskis to keep the form,
a little...

17:08.901 --> 17:11.672
bombers to keep things going,
fucking...

17:12.503 --> 17:14.271
You know,
and do shots to black out

17:14.272 --> 17:16.273
and do whatever the fuck you do
when you're blacked out.

17:16.276 --> 17:19.309
And then... you know,
smoke a doob to level out

17:19.310 --> 17:21.412
and then snort a ripper in the
morning to get back on track.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.318
- You know what I'm saying?
- Good time!

17:25.916 --> 17:27.752
I have no idea
what you just said.

17:33.559 --> 17:35.229
You guys remember Steve Collins?

17:35.560 --> 17:37.830
Oh. Skeazy Steve.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.298
Don't even go there.

17:40.300 --> 17:44.535
That's right! You and Skeazy Steve
had a skeazy sesh together.

17:44.537 --> 17:46.703
- Oh!
- It was freshman year.

17:46.705 --> 17:49.842
It was so long ago,
I can pretend it never happened.

17:50.376 --> 17:51.575
But it did happen.

17:51.577 --> 17:53.880
Oh, it definitely happened.

17:55.348 --> 17:57.483
So, what are we talking about, here?
Intercourse?

17:57.716 --> 18:00.853
No. Just a good old
college beej.

18:01.587 --> 18:04.657
- Ew! She had Skeazy Steve's wiener in her mouth.
- Ugh!

18:04.857 --> 18:07.261
Oh!

18:08.594 --> 18:10.461
I love giving blowjobs.

18:10.463 --> 18:12.596
No, you don't.
No girl actually likes it.

18:12.598 --> 18:13.867
No girl likes blowjobs.

18:14.567 --> 18:15.535
I do.

18:17.502 --> 18:19.670
You know what it is? Guys watch
too much porn these days.

18:19.672 --> 18:21.638
- Yes.
- Yeah, we're not porn stars.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.007
We're not!

18:23.009 --> 18:25.511
Skeazy Steve tried to
jizz on my face.

18:25.744 --> 18:27.010
- Stop.
- Yeah.

18:27.012 --> 18:29.849
- As if girls actually want that.
- Ew...

18:30.383 --> 18:32.052
- You didn't let him, did you?
- God...

18:38.057 --> 18:39.358
Fuck you, man!

18:44.597 --> 18:45.699
Is this area safe?

18:45.932 --> 18:47.601
Fuck yeah. This is my hood, yo.

18:47.966 --> 18:50.303
This isn't actually
your hood, yo.

18:50.603 --> 18:53.073
We'd be back where we came from, right?
With Dad.

18:57.809 --> 19:00.611
It says right here that seven
people were murdered last week.

19:00.613 --> 19:01.578
Right on this spot.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.146
- What?
- Isn't that crazy?

19:03.148 --> 19:06.386
- Yeah.
- Do you guys have smartphones in the UK?

19:07.052 --> 19:09.586
- Yeah.
- No, I mean like smartphones like this.

19:09.588 --> 19:12.455
Not like...
"Operator, can I get me mum?"

19:14.026 --> 19:16.563
- But like this.
- Yeah, yeah, no, we've got smartphones.

19:16.762 --> 19:17.496
I don't think so.

19:17.797 --> 19:19.066
Yo, this is the spot.

19:20.066 --> 19:21.768
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

19:27.139 --> 19:28.809
Kushy's got the best weed
in the world.

19:36.482 --> 19:38.749
All right, well, I guess he's
out for tea or something.

19:38.751 --> 19:40.017
So, we should probably just go.

19:40.019 --> 19:41.887
- Bhagwan.
- Oh, Kush-dog!

19:42.655 --> 19:46.123
Kush be waiting
for the vermin exterminator.

19:46.125 --> 19:49.363
Ah, we...
We came to get some weed.

19:49.761 --> 19:51.932
- Me brethren come to me house for trees?
- Yeah.

19:57.803 --> 19:59.739
Yo, you're gonna have to translate
his British. I don't get it.

20:00.205 --> 20:01.640
That's definitely
not British.

20:03.443 --> 20:05.608
- Yo, Joe, let's make this quick, okay?
- We will.

20:05.610 --> 20:07.211
- Really quick.
- Is anyone else concerned about the...

20:07.213 --> 20:08.615
He's got a firearm. I'm going.

20:08.981 --> 20:11.617
Have yourself some seats,
brothers.

20:13.853 --> 20:14.921
Can we please go?

20:15.922 --> 20:17.424
Project for a bitch.

20:18.590 --> 20:20.223
This is a lovely place
that you have here.

20:20.225 --> 20:22.828
- We can't stay very long, so...
- Have a seat.

20:27.532 --> 20:28.501
Not there!

20:43.049 --> 20:44.682
Oh, bloody hell.

20:44.684 --> 20:47.753
Kush been having trouble with
the enemy and the dirty rats.

20:48.253 --> 20:48.888
But...

20:50.889 --> 20:51.657
Nothing to worry about.

20:53.024 --> 20:54.924
Yo, he's cool.
He's just paranoid.

20:54.926 --> 20:56.562
He's just smoked way too
much weed for a human.

20:57.230 --> 20:57.931
Way too much.

21:01.032 --> 21:03.133
Yeah, so, we'd love to
grab an eighth,

21:03.135 --> 21:04.971
and then we'll just
get out of your hair.

21:09.675 --> 21:13.980
This weed be called...
"the Damp Hamster."

21:15.146 --> 21:18.749
Right. Well, Joey, would you
like to pay the gentleman

21:18.751 --> 21:20.183
and we'll just take the damp
hamster somewhere else?

21:20.185 --> 21:22.752
I smoke with the brother.

21:22.754 --> 21:24.755
Uh... I don't think...

21:24.757 --> 21:26.022
- Do we need to smoke?
- No, we don't need to do that.

21:26.024 --> 21:27.892
- We don't need to smoke right now.
- Not really in the mood.

21:27.894 --> 21:28.995
Two hits...

21:29.794 --> 21:30.930
with the damp hamster...

21:33.031 --> 21:34.701
It make your life go crazy.

21:36.234 --> 21:40.203
Your heart feel like it explode, your
head feel like it be in the tumble dryer,

21:40.205 --> 21:42.742
your face feel like
it being eaten by a cow,

21:43.242 --> 21:45.945
your ass feel like
it being entered.

21:47.780 --> 21:48.915
And then you crash hard.

21:49.714 --> 21:51.548
I have to say,

21:51.550 --> 21:55.152
I'm not particularly in the mood for
any of those sensations right now.

21:55.154 --> 21:56.088
You know?

21:56.955 --> 21:58.657
The friends of Kush
smoke with the Kush.

21:59.591 --> 22:00.193
Oh, my God.

22:05.665 --> 22:06.763
Thank you very much.

22:09.068 --> 22:10.069
Be friends with the Kush.

22:24.215 --> 22:26.785
The sensation of the ass
being entered.

22:27.252 --> 22:28.751
Yup, I felt it.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.203
Where the fuck
did you come from?

23:52.003 --> 23:53.106
I've been here the whole time.

23:53.938 --> 23:54.940
Guys, please wake up.

23:56.041 --> 23:58.409
There's a rat in here.

23:58.411 --> 24:01.045
No, no, no! I assure you,
I'm not a rat.

24:01.047 --> 24:03.346
Your business
is your business, sir. Okay?

24:03.348 --> 24:05.015
- Wake up!
- There's a rat in me house!

24:05.751 --> 24:06.853
Holy shit!

24:10.255 --> 24:11.624
- Watch out for the rat!
- What rat?

24:11.857 --> 24:13.693
Where? Here?

24:14.460 --> 24:16.630
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We would never rat on a G, man!

24:20.366 --> 24:22.266
What rat? Where?

24:22.268 --> 24:24.938
There be rat!

24:25.870 --> 24:26.372
Kush!

24:28.273 --> 24:30.242
Get out of here, filthy rats!

24:30.443 --> 24:33.012
Invade the purity
of the house of the Kush.

24:37.716 --> 24:38.684
The rat!

24:38.951 --> 24:40.451
Oh, God, wait for me!

24:40.453 --> 24:41.954
- No!
- Wait for me!

24:45.991 --> 24:47.356
No!

24:47.358 --> 24:48.959
I thought it was
the passenger seat.

24:48.961 --> 24:50.193
It's the other way round
in England.

24:50.195 --> 24:51.729
Let's go!

24:51.731 --> 24:52.996
Get it in there, come on!

24:52.998 --> 24:54.932
- No, no, no! I'm high as fuck!
- Come on, go, man!

25:01.473 --> 25:04.174
Hi, ladies. I'm Saul.

25:04.777 --> 25:05.843
Hi, Saul.

25:05.845 --> 25:07.747
I'm gonna be your server
on this splendid summer day.

25:08.914 --> 25:09.883
You decided?

25:11.183 --> 25:12.452
- Surf and turf.
- Surf and turf.

25:13.118 --> 25:14.186
Two Dr. Peppers, no ice.

25:16.222 --> 25:17.991
- I'm gonna have the...
- They have chow mein.

25:18.491 --> 25:20.926
- What was that?
- They have chow mein.

25:22.461 --> 25:26.462
Oh, I thought
I could try the Western food

25:26.464 --> 25:28.233
for the first time
in my life.

25:29.135 --> 25:30.369
Don't do it on account of us.

25:30.802 --> 25:32.102
- Don't worry about it.
- Do you have Caesar salad?

25:32.104 --> 25:33.503
- Caesar salad? Yes.
- I'll take that.

25:33.505 --> 25:34.904
It's delicious.

25:34.906 --> 25:37.976
Oh, wait, chips and salsa
and guacamole.

25:38.176 --> 25:40.344
For the lovely Fatima.

25:40.346 --> 25:43.083
I don't think you're pronouncing
it correctly, it's "guacamole."

25:43.382 --> 25:46.115
- Guacamole.
- Gua... Guacamole.

25:46.117 --> 25:47.884
- You like?
- Okay.

25:47.886 --> 25:50.086
I think we'll do the chips and guac
for the table. That'd be great.

25:50.088 --> 25:51.355
- For the table.
- For the table will be great.

25:51.357 --> 25:52.959
Thank you very much...
Ow.

25:53.224 --> 25:54.927
- Great. Thank you, Saul.
- Thank you, Saul.

26:00.432 --> 26:02.332
Yo, El,
you're driving like a 'tard.

26:02.334 --> 26:03.737
- You need to speed up, bro.
- Yeah.

26:04.203 --> 26:06.002
Would you just
give me a break?

26:06.004 --> 26:07.306
I've never driven on the right
side of the road before.

26:13.913 --> 26:16.547
There's a rat! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
There's a rat! There's a rat!

26:16.549 --> 26:18.481
What now, the hizzy?

26:18.483 --> 26:20.220
You guys are stupid.

26:30.061 --> 26:31.764
There's a miniature lion
in here!

26:32.463 --> 26:33.232
Oh, my God.

26:34.966 --> 26:37.002
Why is there a fucking cat
in the car?

26:38.169 --> 26:40.304
It's Princess. It's been
in here the whole time.

26:40.306 --> 26:41.540
Right, well,
we gotta turn around.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.240
- No.
- Yeah.

26:43.242 --> 26:45.041
We're not turning around.

26:45.043 --> 26:46.576
Why don't we just give it to
a child or a lonely vagrant?

26:46.578 --> 26:48.478
No, no, no.
My dad loves his cats.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.114
We're gonna have to just, you
know, just take him with us.

26:51.116 --> 26:54.483
Yes! Road trip! Oh, road
trip, you little pussy.

26:54.485 --> 26:56.220
Can someone else please
take over driving?

26:56.222 --> 26:58.355
- No.
- No, no, no. I'm too stoned, dude.

26:58.357 --> 27:00.026
But you know what?
There's a diner and we can stop

27:00.392 --> 27:01.290
and I'll take over.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.195
- Yup, let's go to a diner.
- I'll take over.

27:31.190 --> 27:32.192
Oh, my God.

27:32.491 --> 27:33.526
There's policemen
over there.

27:37.829 --> 27:38.494
Do you think they can tell we're
under the influence of drugs?

27:38.496 --> 27:40.365
Weed's legal, bro. It's fine.

27:40.665 --> 27:42.432
- Legal?
- Yeah.

27:42.434 --> 27:44.170
Then why the good fuck did
we buy it from that lunatic?

27:46.238 --> 27:47.440
Is that a rhetorical question?

27:48.339 --> 27:50.542
What? No. What? No.

27:54.078 --> 27:55.244
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:55.246 --> 27:57.381
Hey, look. It's the girls.

27:57.383 --> 28:00.049
Oh, my God, did they
follow us or something?

28:00.051 --> 28:01.351
I'm gonna get some cereal.

28:01.353 --> 28:03.185
- Yeah! Get some cereal!
- Yeah!

28:03.187 --> 28:03.922
That sounds good actually.

28:05.190 --> 28:08.624
Did somebody order some stud muffins?

28:08.626 --> 28:10.463
- Fucking hell.
- Hey, do you mind, tits, move over?

28:11.430 --> 28:13.166
Oh, Jesus!

28:13.965 --> 28:14.600
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck?

28:15.367 --> 28:16.935
Thank you. Excuse me.

28:17.502 --> 28:19.068
All right.

28:19.070 --> 28:20.039
- May I sit here? Thank you.
- Yeah, of course.

28:21.406 --> 28:22.439
- She's so clumsy.
- Ew.

28:22.441 --> 28:23.742
You guys reek of weed.

28:24.342 --> 28:27.576
Yeah, my idiot brother nearly got us
killed by a deranged drug dealer.

28:27.578 --> 28:28.513
It was so dope.

28:29.380 --> 28:31.080
Ladies, your food will be
right out.

28:31.082 --> 28:32.217
Thanks, Saul.

28:33.484 --> 28:36.356
Hey, <i>monsieur,</i> could I get
a bowl of cereal, please?

28:36.989 --> 28:40.026
Yes, I will also like
a bowl of cereal, <i>monsieur.</i>

28:40.591 --> 28:42.625
Actually, that sounds really good.
I'll do the same, please, thank you.

28:42.627 --> 28:45.330
Oh, make that six.
And a steak.

28:46.197 --> 28:47.663
How high are you morons?

28:47.665 --> 28:49.066
Quite uncomfortably high.

28:49.068 --> 28:50.636
Six cereal and a steak.

28:51.069 --> 28:53.172
Just give me a shout
if you need anything else.

28:53.504 --> 28:56.105
Okay, yeah,
can I have six more sodas

28:56.107 --> 28:58.477
with some sesame seeds
and some sweet and sour sauce

28:58.711 --> 28:59.646
on my sausage?

29:02.548 --> 29:05.117
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

29:05.584 --> 29:08.354
- Seriously?
- Yes. Seriously.

29:09.521 --> 29:10.322
Seriously?

29:12.491 --> 29:13.225
Seriously.

29:15.094 --> 29:17.330
Joey!

29:17.730 --> 29:18.932
Did you see what I did?

29:20.432 --> 29:21.467
You see what I did?

29:22.467 --> 29:24.036
No, I missed it.
It must have been really subtle.

29:26.004 --> 29:28.140
- Don't judge all of America on Joey.
- Okay.

29:30.509 --> 29:34.113
Okay, well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to, uh, go the toilet.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.113
Don't you mean the loo?

29:36.115 --> 29:39.018
Oh, yes. I'm going to the loo
to do a number two.

29:39.550 --> 29:41.218
Ew!

29:41.220 --> 29:42.685
Yeah, I'm not. No. I didn't...
I didn't mean that.

29:42.687 --> 29:45.321
I meant... one is all I need.

29:45.323 --> 29:47.359
- I'm really high, so...
- Okay, bye.

29:48.394 --> 29:50.660
He likes you!

29:50.662 --> 29:51.965
Stop. Stop it.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.066
- Oops.
- Oh!

29:56.068 --> 29:57.299
Sorry.

29:58.636 --> 30:01.203
- It's not funny.
- It's what you get!

30:01.205 --> 30:02.175
It's bad service.

30:07.146 --> 30:08.013
Oh, my God.

30:10.448 --> 30:12.315
Seriously,
I'm not wearing this anymore.

30:12.317 --> 30:13.553
It really does
suit you though.

30:14.787 --> 30:15.722
I got some less gangster shit
if you're not feeling that.

30:16.489 --> 30:17.721
Surprisingly,
I'm not feeling it,

30:17.723 --> 30:21.194
considering it only says "Fuck
the police" in giant letters.

30:21.460 --> 30:23.093
So, where are you guys
staying tonight?

30:23.095 --> 30:24.528
Oh, we haven't thought
that far ahead.

30:24.530 --> 30:26.462
Maybe we should stay
where you guys are staying.

30:26.464 --> 30:28.201
Fuck that!
These bitches made bank.

30:28.434 --> 30:30.232
I live foot-to-mouth, my dog.
I don't do that.

30:30.234 --> 30:31.503
I'm pretty sure it's
"hand-to-mouth."

30:32.437 --> 30:33.737
And what is that?

30:33.739 --> 30:37.242
And I'm sure us bitches
got the last room.

30:38.376 --> 30:39.776
Is that a cat in your car?

30:39.778 --> 30:40.646
Yup.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.781
Okay, I think we're
gonna head out.

30:43.281 --> 30:44.247
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

30:44.249 --> 30:44.784
- Oh.
- Oh.

30:51.456 --> 30:53.323
Oh!

30:53.325 --> 30:56.062
- What the F was that?
- Shut up. Please shut up. Go away. Go away.

30:58.262 --> 31:01.298
Oh, guys, I'm gonna text you
an address for tomorrow,

31:01.300 --> 31:03.202
so meet us there at noon,
all right?

31:04.103 --> 31:06.236
It's a surprise,
like your hug.

31:06.238 --> 31:07.206
Shotgun.

31:07.572 --> 31:09.608
- Shotgun.
- Oh, he's learning.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.520
Yo, El, please stop being
a baby dick around Sky.

31:21.653 --> 31:22.789
What is he on about?

31:23.222 --> 31:24.089
Well, you do
kind of like her.

31:25.156 --> 31:26.059
Yeah.

31:26.524 --> 31:27.423
You wanna bang her, right?

31:27.425 --> 31:29.659
Well, no, I like her, so...

31:29.661 --> 31:31.560
You just tried to give her some sort
of Special Ed hug back there. Uh-uh.

31:31.562 --> 31:33.596
No. No, it was a hug goodbye.

31:33.598 --> 31:35.068
Just a friendly hug goodbye.

31:35.334 --> 31:36.536
You know what you should
have done?

31:37.736 --> 31:38.769
You should have ignored her
at lunch, hit on her friends,

31:38.771 --> 31:40.673
and then bitched her out
when we were leaving.

31:40.873 --> 31:42.506
Guarantee you,
she would have blown you.

31:42.508 --> 31:45.342
- Great. In the parking lot.
- In the parking lot.

31:45.344 --> 31:47.477
- If she would have done that, I would've...
- Shut up, Fridge.

31:47.479 --> 31:50.646
Seriously, the worse you treat
them, the more they want you.

31:50.648 --> 31:51.684
It's the golden rule.

31:52.818 --> 31:55.221
American girls are, like,
attracted to douchebags.

31:55.753 --> 31:58.623
Trust me, bro.
I know what I'm talking about.

31:58.857 --> 31:59.591
I really do.

32:02.461 --> 32:03.492
What are you doing?

32:03.494 --> 32:04.928
No warning, nothing. Just...

32:04.930 --> 32:07.530
Okay. I had that cereal
with the chunky milk

32:07.532 --> 32:08.765
and then more of the creamer.

32:08.767 --> 32:09.434
You did have...

32:10.601 --> 32:12.204
What the hell is going on?

32:14.373 --> 32:15.174
Rank!

32:15.907 --> 32:17.242
It's the creamer, right?

32:18.277 --> 32:20.442
I breathed, and there's...
I smelled his puke.

32:20.444 --> 32:21.481
He's awesome.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.699
My T-shirt is covered in vomit.

32:40.898 --> 32:42.167
Fine, here's another one.

32:42.367 --> 32:43.435
Oh, God.

32:47.606 --> 32:49.242
No. No, here.

32:49.707 --> 32:53.375
No. No, no,
you're not gonna have that. No.

32:53.377 --> 32:54.713
Sorry. Sorry, just...

32:56.447 --> 32:57.449
Sorry. You know...

33:00.851 --> 33:02.919
Praise the Lord
on this fine day.

33:02.921 --> 33:03.655
Praise him.

33:06.491 --> 33:08.224
Yup... praise him.

33:08.226 --> 33:12.497
Has the Lord exposed himself
to you in all his ways?

33:13.498 --> 33:16.900
Exposed himself?
I would say... not... not... not...

33:16.902 --> 33:20.436
Do you have tea?
Could I get a cup of tea?

33:20.438 --> 33:24.242
By the grace of the Lord,
we have tea of the iced variety.

33:24.509 --> 33:25.778
Okay, not hot tea?

33:26.944 --> 33:28.912
If iced tea was good enough
for Jesus at the Last Supper,

33:28.914 --> 33:30.313
it's good enough for you, buddy.

33:30.315 --> 33:31.350
Amen.

33:32.416 --> 33:33.319
All right.

33:34.386 --> 33:36.888
I'm not sure that's biblically
accurate, you know?

33:38.490 --> 33:40.890
Uh... Orange soda, then, instead.
That would be great.

33:40.892 --> 33:41.661
Big Slurp?

33:43.261 --> 33:44.994
Yes. One of those.
Not quite sure what it means,

33:44.996 --> 33:47.430
- but I'll trust this gentleman.
- No.

33:47.432 --> 33:50.203
Praise the Lord.
Big Slurp it is.

33:52.671 --> 33:55.540
- What? Come on.
- Okay.

33:58.844 --> 34:00.846
Sorry, are we gonna be
sharing this?

34:01.413 --> 34:02.479
No, we're not.

34:02.481 --> 34:05.885
3.99. In God we trust.

34:07.286 --> 34:09.451
- Yeah, I wish you'd hurry up, too.
- Okay, sorry.

34:09.453 --> 34:09.987
Have a nice day.

34:11.422 --> 34:12.788
Go with God.

34:12.790 --> 34:14.757
You're in God's country.

34:14.760 --> 34:15.958
I noticed, thank you.
It's very nice.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.228
We're his favorite.

34:27.371 --> 34:30.743
I found us a motel
50 miles from here.

34:31.409 --> 34:32.444
And it says here...

34:33.844 --> 34:37.350
it's Ladies Night
across the street,

34:37.716 --> 34:39.784
at the adults only bar.

34:40.784 --> 34:43.822
Hey, man, chill, okay?
Dad gotta take a pee.

34:45.524 --> 34:46.292
Okay.

34:53.864 --> 34:54.964
Oh!

34:54.966 --> 34:57.033
No. No,
you shouldn't be in here.

34:57.034 --> 34:58.537
Boy, what you be doing?

34:59.104 --> 35:00.970
Get out.
Please, respect my privacy.

35:01.805 --> 35:03.441
You could not be in here.

35:03.874 --> 35:05.008
- Oh, hell, no!
- Get out.

35:08.979 --> 35:11.850
No, no, no! This must look
rather inappropriate.

35:12.651 --> 35:14.654
You nasty motherfucker!

35:14.986 --> 35:17.823
- Wait, I can't find Princess.
- Princess is gonna take a little time-out.

35:19.091 --> 35:21.527
Go! Start the car!

35:22.727 --> 35:23.561
What are you doing?

35:24.428 --> 35:25.298
Go! Go, go!

35:25.997 --> 35:27.363
Go! Go!

35:27.365 --> 35:28.533
- Go! Go! Go!
- That's right, you better run!

35:29.935 --> 35:31.470
You better run. I'll find you.

35:31.769 --> 35:33.472
- Come on!
- Big-Slurping motherfucker!

35:34.004 --> 35:35.772
It's not funny.

35:37.542 --> 35:38.611
It's not funny.

35:39.510 --> 35:41.477
Did you just lure
that man's child?

35:41.479 --> 35:43.379
No, I didn't do
any luring at all.

35:43.381 --> 35:45.717
Okay, I think the real question
is: Are you a child molester?

35:46.385 --> 35:49.522
No, I didn't think we'd actually have
to clarify that bit. No, I am not.

35:50.388 --> 35:52.821
- Is this a British thing?
- Yeah, I hear Brits are really into that.

35:52.823 --> 35:53.459
Yeah.

35:54.593 --> 35:56.392
I'm not down with that.

35:56.394 --> 35:57.361
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.631
- That's not cool.
- Very funny. Very, very funny.

36:00.698 --> 36:02.064
- Give me a K!
- K!

36:02.066 --> 36:04.066
You got your K,
you got your K!

36:04.068 --> 36:05.769
Give me an A! A!

36:05.771 --> 36:07.870
You got your A,
you got your A!

36:07.872 --> 36:09.071
- Give me a double-P!
- Double-P!

36:09.073 --> 36:10.973
You got your P,
you got your P!

36:10.975 --> 36:11.843
Give me an A!

36:13.044 --> 36:13.846
I don't know this song.

36:15.714 --> 36:16.682
Give me an A!

36:17.415 --> 36:18.050
You got your A.

36:38.437 --> 36:42.439
There's a gas station up the road,
if she could have just waited.

36:42.441 --> 36:43.542
I can hear you.

36:43.809 --> 36:46.442
When I have to go,
I have to go!

36:46.444 --> 36:49.446
I heard Brad Schlonghauser's
gonna be at this party.

36:49.448 --> 36:51.083
Oh, God, don't tell me that.

36:51.816 --> 36:53.850
Why? This could be your chance
to get him back.

36:53.852 --> 36:55.554
I don't want him back.

36:55.854 --> 36:58.187
Him dumping me was the best
thing that could have happened.

36:58.189 --> 37:00.091
He's like a juiced-up
Ken doll.

37:00.859 --> 37:02.995
Can you turn the other way? You're
kind of giving me stage fright.

37:04.528 --> 37:05.530
I seen it all before.

37:06.765 --> 37:07.533
Lots of times.

37:08.700 --> 37:11.102
- Sky?
- Can you hurry this up?

37:12.102 --> 37:12.871
Thank you.

37:14.472 --> 37:16.506
"Hey ladies, I'm Brad.

37:16.508 --> 37:20.209
I've got a plastic stump instead
of a dick, like an action figure."

37:20.211 --> 37:23.979
"Hey ladies, I'm Brad. I Instagram
myself daily at the gym,

37:23.981 --> 37:24.983
doing squats."

37:25.917 --> 37:28.051
But he's so hot,
though.

37:28.053 --> 37:29.752
I feel like we've been here
for an hour.

37:29.754 --> 37:32.658
Okay, well, it takes me a long
time because you kept talking.

37:32.890 --> 37:34.526
- Well, now it's my turn, so...
- Okay.

37:35.760 --> 37:36.662
Look out for a girl.

37:40.064 --> 37:41.499
You'll need to
find some tissue.

37:42.633 --> 37:43.802
I have a feeling this isn't
just gonna be a number one.

37:44.568 --> 37:45.868
Sky?

37:45.870 --> 37:47.504
Oh, my fucking God.

37:47.506 --> 37:48.140
Sky?

37:50.575 --> 37:52.107
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

37:52.109 --> 37:53.111
Oh, my God!

37:53.678 --> 37:56.044
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

37:56.046 --> 37:58.016
Oh, my God, that's deadly!

38:02.086 --> 38:04.489
Yo, stop the car!
Yo, back up. Back up.

38:05.122 --> 38:06.157
Oh, come on, Joey, no.

38:11.196 --> 38:13.595
It's just frat letters
on my chest... KOK.

38:14.732 --> 38:16.165
Like a true frat star
for the party.

38:16.167 --> 38:19.134
Yeah, but it's not just for the
party, it's your life, man.

38:19.136 --> 38:20.035
It's permanent.

38:20.037 --> 38:22.574
Yeah, we're frat brothers
for life, so...

38:23.107 --> 38:24.008
I'm cool with permanent.

38:25.943 --> 38:27.779
You little lambs
got an appointment?

38:28.647 --> 38:29.982
"Little lambs"?

38:31.316 --> 38:33.750
Not that you need one. I ain't
done a tattoo in over a month.

38:35.153 --> 38:36.522
Yo, I've changed my mind.

38:37.088 --> 38:38.122
- Thank God, let's go.
- No.

38:39.823 --> 38:40.626
I don't want the frat letters.

38:41.660 --> 38:42.928
I want those.

38:44.361 --> 38:47.265
Oh, no, no, no. See, those are in
memory of people who have passed away.

38:47.865 --> 38:48.967
Sorry for your loss.

38:50.234 --> 38:51.937
Or people you've murdered.

38:52.736 --> 38:54.539
- What?
- Right.

38:54.772 --> 38:55.872
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

38:55.874 --> 38:56.939
I wanna rock that shit.

38:56.941 --> 38:59.142
- Joe, I love you.
- Homo.

38:59.144 --> 39:02.111
You're my brother, but you gotta
trust me when I tell you,

39:02.113 --> 39:04.116
you don't want that
tattooed on your face.

39:04.582 --> 39:05.818
I want it in memory of Mom.

39:08.185 --> 39:09.053
Oh, well...

39:16.694 --> 39:17.830
Damn dog.

39:18.997 --> 39:20.129
He's shitting all over the house.
It's everywhere.

39:20.131 --> 39:21.064
Oh, God.

39:21.066 --> 39:22.701
Oh, dear God.

39:24.736 --> 39:26.038
- You got a name?
- Joey.

39:26.805 --> 39:28.173
AKA Young Joseph.

39:29.140 --> 39:30.009
They call me Dirty.

39:31.343 --> 39:32.845
You know how I got my name?

39:33.144 --> 39:35.046
Well, it wouldn't take a
rocket scientist, right?

39:35.379 --> 39:37.212
No, why?

39:37.214 --> 39:40.116
Now, it all started when I was
just, like, a little gator.

39:40.118 --> 39:42.919
You know, I'd run around fixing
what needed to be fixing...

39:42.921 --> 39:45.888
and beating on
whatever needed to be beat on.

39:45.890 --> 39:49.625
And my auntie was breastfeeding
my baby sister.

39:49.627 --> 39:53.129
And I come in from the yard
all covered in mud and blood.

39:53.131 --> 39:55.734
Now, my momma said,
"Boy, your hands are..."

39:57.035 --> 39:58.870
- Dirty?
- "Delicate."

39:59.870 --> 40:01.803
So she tells me to use my hands

40:01.805 --> 40:04.042
to clean the dead vermin
out of the drain.

40:04.309 --> 40:07.680
So, I reach my hands
right down in there

40:08.146 --> 40:11.013
and use my nails
to scrape off the goo and guts.

40:11.015 --> 40:12.350
And my daddy says,

40:12.816 --> 40:15.787
- "Boy, you sure are..."
- Dirty.

40:16.854 --> 40:17.722
"Detailed."

40:19.823 --> 40:21.961
Years later,
when I got my own trailer,

40:22.693 --> 40:24.862
and the refrigerator's
full of mice

40:25.162 --> 40:26.928
and the john's full of flies

40:26.930 --> 40:29.200
and there's roaches
all over the bed,

40:29.734 --> 40:32.705
everybody kept saying,
"Boy, your trailer sure is..."

40:34.238 --> 40:37.006
Well, I mean, I think the
word should be "dirty,"

40:37.008 --> 40:38.711
but I'm guessing
it was something else.

40:38.910 --> 40:39.812
"Designer."

40:42.147 --> 40:44.650
And I laugh. I laugh, like a...

40:57.227 --> 40:59.130
Grown man being called designer?

41:00.298 --> 41:03.198
Well, that sure is funny.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.801
Um... So, maybe we should
just end on that high note.

41:05.803 --> 41:07.270
- Maybe we should.
- Yeah.

41:07.272 --> 41:10.776
No, no, no, guys. Before we go,
we should probably find out.

41:11.142 --> 41:13.779
Why do they call you "Dirty"?

41:15.979 --> 41:20.019
My twin brother. He's an
unhygienic piece of shit.

41:20.385 --> 41:23.122
They always getting us
confused and the name stuck.

41:24.122 --> 41:26.357
Mistaken identity. I hate when
that shit happens, you know?

41:29.093 --> 41:31.129
So, how much does this cost?

41:31.495 --> 41:34.298
- Two hundred dollars.
- Fuck that. I can't afford that.

41:34.832 --> 41:37.165
- Excuse me?
- Okay, how about a hundred?

41:37.167 --> 41:39.167
Hey, how about 300?

41:39.169 --> 41:42.037
How about payment
in the form of a pet cat?

41:42.039 --> 41:44.073
Fuck you and your cat.

41:44.075 --> 41:46.345
How much would the work
you've already done cost us?

41:50.013 --> 41:50.816
Fifty dollars.

41:53.350 --> 41:55.053
- Yeah?
- That was worth it.

41:58.122 --> 41:59.758
I dig it. That's cool.

42:02.926 --> 42:05.060
Oh, wow, place looks good, Shu.
Nice work.

42:05.062 --> 42:06.898
You're welcome. Give it up.

42:07.464 --> 42:09.334
Are you still
bringing your bedsheets?

42:09.801 --> 42:11.837
Do you know how dirty
the hotel ones are?

42:12.069 --> 42:12.870
Hell, yeah.

42:13.138 --> 42:15.171
I saw a documentary.

42:15.173 --> 42:18.010
They found 6,000 traces of shit just
on the light switch of the hotel.

42:18.776 --> 42:22.080
And, like, ten million
traces of, like, jizz

42:22.347 --> 42:24.816
all over the TV screen, like...

42:25.415 --> 42:26.452
Oh.

42:27.785 --> 42:30.486
Let's play truth or dare
tonight.

42:30.488 --> 42:32.725
- Oh, my God.
- What are we, five years old?

42:33.258 --> 42:34.158
I don't play that game anymore.

42:34.792 --> 42:35.794
That's how I ended up in county.

42:36.327 --> 42:37.495
As in, county jail?

42:39.129 --> 42:41.133
What? I didn't know
you went to jail.

42:42.300 --> 42:44.435
Think they'd let me work at school
if they knew I served time?

42:44.968 --> 42:47.035
I stole someone's identity.
We're all good.

42:51.176 --> 42:52.411
Amy, bedmates.

42:52.877 --> 42:53.812
For sure.

42:55.046 --> 42:56.248
Don't drop the soap.

42:58.348 --> 43:00.218
Oh, for fuck's sake.

43:00.984 --> 43:02.884
I don't know, it's got
pretty good reviews online.

43:02.886 --> 43:05.124
Yeah, from serial killers
and rapists?

43:07.191 --> 43:08.426
No, I got it. I got it.

43:17.202 --> 43:18.267
- Just come on.
- I got it.

43:18.269 --> 43:20.071
- Come on.
- No, I got it. I got it.

43:21.839 --> 43:22.374
Dude.

43:24.475 --> 43:25.444
- Thanks, guys.
- No problem.

43:29.914 --> 43:31.249
Are you open?

43:32.984 --> 43:34.219
Of course we're open, man.

43:35.019 --> 43:36.955
Sixty years.

43:38.089 --> 43:39.792
And I'm the best around here,
do you know?

43:40.057 --> 43:42.460
I watch movies all the time.
I watch all day...

43:46.064 --> 43:47.065
How you doing?

43:48.131 --> 43:49.801
- Me?
- Are you talking to me?

43:54.272 --> 43:56.809
He has to call you this.
He has to call you this.

44:01.312 --> 44:03.048
What do you mean by that,
Mr. Sosa?

44:05.584 --> 44:07.917
- Is that British?
- No, that's definitely not British.

44:07.919 --> 44:09.451
- How do you know?
- That's not British.

44:09.453 --> 44:10.886
- How do you know?
- Don't worry.

44:10.888 --> 44:12.490
I studied languages
in high school.

44:13.156 --> 44:15.093
I'll take care of this.

44:15.426 --> 44:19.095
Um... <i>Achtung.</i>
We want a room.

44:19.097 --> 44:20.363
No, fuck that.
I'm not sharing a room.

44:20.365 --> 44:22.397
- Why?
- Because...

44:22.399 --> 44:24.399
I'm bringing chicks back and I don't
need you freaks voyeuring in on me.

44:24.401 --> 44:26.201
Where do you expect
to find women?

44:26.203 --> 44:28.303
- I told you there was a hook-up adult place across the street.
- Huh?

44:28.305 --> 44:29.607
How are you gonna get in?
Come on.

44:31.575 --> 44:35.410
Tonight is
special on some ladies.

44:35.412 --> 44:38.214
- Ladies?
- Some... sex!

44:38.216 --> 44:40.015
- Sex? Yes.
- I definitely heard something about sex.

44:40.017 --> 44:42.887
Fuck, yeah. Let's get wasted
and have some sex with ladies.

44:43.521 --> 44:45.587
You know what? I'm beat.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

44:45.589 --> 44:48.591
Yeah, you know what? I just wanna lay
down in my bed and think about Fatima.

44:48.593 --> 44:50.091
No.

44:50.093 --> 44:52.595
- It has been quite a long day.
- No. What? What? No.

44:52.597 --> 44:54.330
You'll wingman with me, yes?
Uh-huh?

44:54.332 --> 44:55.334
- Uh...
- Two rooms, my dude.

44:56.535 --> 44:57.500
You two choads can jerk each
other off in your room.

44:57.502 --> 44:59.567
Me and the Brit
are gonna be Eiffel Towering.

44:59.569 --> 45:00.305
What does that mean?

45:14.118 --> 45:16.185
This is slightly disappointing.

45:16.187 --> 45:17.122
It's a little early.

45:17.622 --> 45:18.457
Yeah.

45:19.356 --> 45:20.224
Let's get some drinks.

45:21.091 --> 45:22.660
- All right. Okay.
- Let's get some drinks.

45:25.129 --> 45:26.531
Line us up some
brew-ha-has, my man.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.502
No?

45:31.401 --> 45:33.004
We're serving
brain-ticklers tonight.

45:34.638 --> 45:37.573
Hmm. Not... Probably not quite
what we had in mind. Is there...

45:37.575 --> 45:38.944
That's all we're serving.

45:39.644 --> 45:40.479
What's in a brain-tickler?

45:41.546 --> 45:43.048
Brain. Tickler.

45:44.214 --> 45:45.050
Yeah,
I'm gonna take two of them.

45:46.249 --> 45:47.385
- Um...
- Yeah, you are.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.321
- Beer or wine or...
- Stop.

45:51.356 --> 45:52.290
Um...

45:56.060 --> 45:58.263
So have you, like, thought about
what you wanna do as a job?

45:58.595 --> 46:00.462
Like, career path or anything?

46:00.464 --> 46:01.432
Is that a rhetorical question?

46:02.100 --> 46:03.635
No. No.

46:04.167 --> 46:07.069
I'm not completely sure
you know what rhetorical means.

46:07.071 --> 46:08.504
Of course I do.
I know what rhetorical means.

46:08.506 --> 46:10.107
It's just your British accent.

46:16.113 --> 46:16.714
Ah...

46:17.515 --> 46:18.417
Cheers.

46:21.551 --> 46:22.254
Wow.

46:28.359 --> 46:29.691
I'm gonna take
four more of them.

46:29.693 --> 46:31.095
Ooh, I don't know.

46:31.796 --> 46:33.495
And you can keep them flowing.

46:35.332 --> 46:37.566
- I don't know if I need any more of that.
- You look a little weird.

46:37.568 --> 46:39.234
Feeling quite uncomfortable,
actually. Quite strange.

46:39.236 --> 46:40.368
I feel great.

46:45.042 --> 46:46.207
Ooh.

47:06.664 --> 47:08.330
- Was that the right song?
- I don't know.

47:16.240 --> 47:19.077
I don't know if I like my brains
being tickled, you know?

47:23.214 --> 47:26.582
And you know, also, I'm not sold
on this whole, like,

47:26.584 --> 47:29.354
- "be mean to girls and they'll like you" theory.
- No!

47:30.153 --> 47:32.187
Trust me. Be a dick!

47:32.189 --> 47:33.457
Next girl that walks in here,
be a dick.

47:35.359 --> 47:39.160
I don't know, I'd really prefer
to just be nice, you know?

47:39.162 --> 47:42.733
No. No. None of this nice guy,
British bullshit.

47:43.501 --> 47:44.502
It's... It's bullshit.

47:46.437 --> 47:48.640
I just... I like to be
nice and polite here.

47:54.678 --> 47:57.214
See? It's meant to happen.

47:57.647 --> 47:58.682
I... I knew it.

48:00.350 --> 48:02.250
Ladies, hi!

48:03.220 --> 48:05.689
- Come join us.
- Okay.

48:07.225 --> 48:08.427
Hi!

48:08.792 --> 48:10.758
- Pleasure to meet you, I'm Elliot.
- Hi. Joey.

48:10.760 --> 48:11.593
- Hi.
- Good evening.

48:11.595 --> 48:12.696
I mean, that weather...

48:14.464 --> 48:16.598
- Stop it. Stop.
- It's good. It's been good.

48:16.600 --> 48:17.633
- Be a dick.
- I don't wanna do it.

48:17.635 --> 48:19.437
Shut the fuck up
and be a dick.

48:19.870 --> 48:21.639
- Be a dick.
- Okay, okay. I'll try, I'll try.

48:27.144 --> 48:28.713
You, uh...

48:30.314 --> 48:32.584
You certainly are,
uh, smelly.

48:34.385 --> 48:35.252
Aren't you?

48:37.722 --> 48:41.626
Oh. Well, you're certainly
turning me on.

48:42.660 --> 48:44.192
- Wh...
- Whoa!

48:44.194 --> 48:44.863
Whoa!

48:45.897 --> 48:47.766
- You're a fucking master at this.
- Oh, yeah.

48:48.198 --> 48:49.732
Oh, you stink.

48:49.734 --> 48:51.332
Oh!
Did you just queef?

48:51.334 --> 48:52.868
Keep them flowing.

48:52.870 --> 48:55.337
You want a drink, you fat
pig-horse with hepatitis?

48:55.339 --> 48:56.604
British.

48:56.606 --> 48:57.742
Stop breathing on me.
You reek.

48:58.709 --> 49:01.877
You're a disturbed, demented,
old wrinkly goat, aren't you?

49:01.879 --> 49:03.248
What's that,
your vagina or something?

49:04.448 --> 49:07.383
Stinks of fish and shit...
and stuff.

49:07.385 --> 49:10.455
I look at you and I just see
a soiled diaper in a dress.

49:12.390 --> 49:14.189
Ready to shag,
you dirty troll?

49:37.347 --> 49:37.915
How you doing?

49:41.252 --> 49:44.352
Hey. Hey there,
Mr. James Bond.

49:44.354 --> 49:45.654
I still need to get paid.

49:45.656 --> 49:46.754
What, a righteous one?

49:46.756 --> 49:48.357
Oh, what are you
hiding under there?

49:48.359 --> 49:50.725
- Nothing.
- Is somebody else awake, finally?

49:50.727 --> 49:53.361
- No!
- Come on, 007.

49:53.363 --> 49:56.497
- No, no!
- This dirty troll still wants to get shagged.

49:56.499 --> 49:58.299
- Go away.
- Fancy a little rough-housing, eh?

49:58.301 --> 49:59.734
No, I don't. No...

49:59.736 --> 50:01.337
- A little rough-housing will do you.
- No.

50:01.339 --> 50:02.638
Huh? Huh?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.542
Like it rough, a little rough?

50:04.908 --> 50:06.575
You like... You like...

50:07.812 --> 50:08.644
Get...

50:08.646 --> 50:09.814
Oh!

50:11.649 --> 50:12.484
Dude.

50:13.551 --> 50:14.553
Did you just knock her out?

50:14.752 --> 50:16.986
No, I... It's not a her,
it's a he.

50:16.988 --> 50:18.654
It's a man. It's a man.

50:18.656 --> 50:21.022
Oh, shit!

50:24.028 --> 50:25.961
- I'm sorry.
- What did you do to Travis?

50:25.963 --> 50:26.897
No. I'm sorry.

50:29.600 --> 50:32.270
You did not! Oh, my God!

50:32.535 --> 50:34.370
Wow. You're really
into some freaky shit, huh?

50:34.372 --> 50:36.839
First you molest a kid
and now you fight a tranny?

50:36.841 --> 50:40.743
I didn't... know she was a he. That
brain-tickler drink fucked me up.

50:40.745 --> 50:42.380
Well, you didn't
have to beat her.

50:43.948 --> 50:46.982
How about you try wrestling with a 200-pound
man-woman trying to grab your penis?

50:46.984 --> 50:48.450
- I have!
- What?

50:48.452 --> 50:51.356
- Did you do anything with her?
- No! Thank God.

50:52.789 --> 50:53.724
Joe?

50:54.925 --> 50:56.058
Define "anything."

50:56.060 --> 50:57.325
- No!
- What?

50:57.327 --> 50:59.663
Oh! Oh!

51:01.798 --> 51:03.501
So, what did your lover
think of your new tat?

51:06.771 --> 51:07.738
What?

51:09.307 --> 51:11.810
Oh, whatever. Let's not act like I'm the
only one who got in bed with a tranny.

51:14.879 --> 51:18.346
Anyways, at least my plan to get
El laid paid off.

51:18.348 --> 51:19.948
No, I didn't...
But I didn't get laid.

51:19.950 --> 51:21.450
Can we just make that
totally clear?

51:21.452 --> 51:23.354
I didn't do anything
with her, okay?

51:25.423 --> 51:27.689
Point is... my plan is legit.

51:27.691 --> 51:29.894
If you do that at the frat party,
panties are gonna just drop.

51:30.894 --> 51:31.959
- No.
- Yeah.

51:31.961 --> 51:32.795
No.

51:33.930 --> 51:35.763
And look,
I'm really sorry to disappoint,

51:35.765 --> 51:39.738
but I'm not into this whole, like,
"Let's get lots of chicks" thing.

51:42.006 --> 51:43.841
Oh, please don't tell me
what I think you're gonna say.

51:44.475 --> 51:45.441
What?

51:45.443 --> 51:47.075
Please don't tell me you're gay.

51:47.077 --> 51:49.111
I already have one gay brother, and
I just... I don't want another one.

51:49.113 --> 51:50.682
I'm not gay, dude.

51:52.682 --> 51:53.885
Yeah,
we're going the wrong way.

51:54.084 --> 51:55.720
No, Skylar has
that surprise.

52:01.359 --> 52:02.524
You're disgusting.

52:02.526 --> 52:03.728
Oh, you should pull
your dick out.

52:03.928 --> 52:05.730
I have no desire to do that.

52:08.031 --> 52:08.999
What is this place?

52:18.508 --> 52:19.910
Whoo-hoo!

52:41.499 --> 52:42.834
Whoa! Oh!

52:52.776 --> 52:54.044
I want to go home!

53:01.051 --> 53:04.856
- So...
- Uh, so, this is crazy.

53:05.055 --> 53:06.921
I don't know how you
found a place like this.

53:06.923 --> 53:08.892
No, what do you think
of your new family?

53:09.926 --> 53:12.930
Oh.
Yeah, they're, um...

53:15.432 --> 53:17.968
- They're gr... They're great. They're...
- Yeah. They are.

53:20.805 --> 53:22.906
Just so you know, this is the
happiest I've ever seen them.

53:24.874 --> 53:26.143
It really sucked
when their mom died.

53:29.180 --> 53:31.515
Your mom has really
transformed Michaelson.

53:37.220 --> 53:39.488
Eh... He's a bit odd,
isn't he?

53:39.490 --> 53:41.426
- Oh, he's weird as shit.
- Yeah. Yeah, I think.

53:41.859 --> 53:42.994
But in the best way.

53:46.464 --> 53:48.767
To be honest, the fact he's around
makes him better than my dad was.

53:49.732 --> 53:51.970
I just don't want to see my mom
getting hurt again.

53:54.004 --> 53:57.142
Anyway... I shouldn't
talk to you about that.

53:57.807 --> 54:00.644
No, of course. It's your mom.

54:00.977 --> 54:01.745
You should be protective.

54:03.481 --> 54:04.745
I can't wait to meet her,
by the way.

54:04.747 --> 54:06.747
Oh, she can't wait
to meet you, yeah.

54:06.749 --> 54:08.685
- You told her about me.
- No, I didn't.

54:09.486 --> 54:10.155
Um...

54:10.787 --> 54:12.423
No, maybe. I think just in...

54:12.856 --> 54:14.725
- I don't know, maybe in passing.
- Right, yeah.

54:16.026 --> 54:16.660
Just in passing.

54:18.062 --> 54:19.464
Just an accident
or something.

54:25.169 --> 54:27.002
So, I heard Fridge
is riding with the girls.

54:27.004 --> 54:27.872
Do you want to come in our car?

54:28.705 --> 54:29.841
Yeah, I'd love to.

54:43.620 --> 54:46.957
I'm a real aficionado
for humorous apparel.

54:47.857 --> 54:50.727
I have a range of humorous,
hilarious T-shirts.

54:51.095 --> 54:53.698
Such as "Orgasm Donor."

54:53.897 --> 54:56.131
Oh, like in "organ donor,"

54:56.133 --> 54:57.100
- but with an orgasm.
- Orgasm.

54:58.167 --> 54:59.838
- Yeah.
- I appreciate that.

55:00.870 --> 55:02.571
I have another one that says,

55:02.573 --> 55:05.910
"My idea of a balanced meal
is a beer in each hand."

55:06.544 --> 55:07.145
Amen.

55:08.044 --> 55:09.977
Please stop.

55:09.979 --> 55:12.548
And I just ordered this new one.
It says, "FBI,"

55:12.550 --> 55:13.651
but underneath it, it says...

55:14.651 --> 55:15.819
Oh, "Female Body Inspector."

55:16.754 --> 55:17.789
Yeah.

55:25.963 --> 55:28.600
I swear I'm gonna
crash this fucking car.

55:28.798 --> 55:31.700
I got dumped, had to move
back in with my parents

55:31.702 --> 55:34.671
because my salary doesn't cover
my student loan payments.

55:35.606 --> 55:37.305
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

55:37.307 --> 55:40.210
But how boring would it be if we
had it all figured out, right?

55:40.843 --> 55:42.944
That's true. It would be
pretty boring, wouldn't it?

55:42.946 --> 55:43.981
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:45.249 --> 55:46.917
What an idiot.

55:48.385 --> 55:50.120
Your ex-boyfriend. A complete moron.
He's... He's gonna regret that forever.

55:50.921 --> 55:52.787
I don't think he cares.

55:52.789 --> 55:54.691
- Really?
- Apparently, he wanted someone better.

55:55.325 --> 55:56.894
- That's why my ex dumped me.
- Really?

55:57.595 --> 55:58.794
Well, she lost a keeper.

55:58.796 --> 56:00.598
- She did, didn't she?
- Yeah, screw her!

56:01.097 --> 56:02.165
Screw her.

56:02.665 --> 56:04.799
Does she know that you're
a P-I-M-P?

56:04.801 --> 56:06.104
I am a P-I-M-P.

56:06.903 --> 56:08.639
I am. How did you know?

56:09.339 --> 56:10.542
Okay. Turn your head.

56:15.312 --> 56:16.681
No, Joey.

56:20.084 --> 56:21.586
Can you drop me
at the sorority, Sean?

56:22.252 --> 56:23.788
Okay.
Can I come?

56:42.939 --> 56:43.675
Bye-bye.

56:46.075 --> 56:46.774
Don't let him in.

56:46.776 --> 56:47.345
Fridge.

56:47.877 --> 56:48.879
Come on, Fridge.

56:49.912 --> 56:51.115
- Do it again.
- No, no, for real.

56:52.015 --> 56:54.351
- Okay.
- Yay!

56:55.185 --> 56:56.220
See you at the party!

56:57.187 --> 57:00.091
Whoo! College, baby!
Young Joseph is back!

57:06.830 --> 57:07.699
Are we here?

57:08.533 --> 57:09.801
Is this it?
Is this the fraternity?

57:20.144 --> 57:21.111
Welcome to heaven, boys.

57:23.113 --> 57:24.749
Prepare for your world
to get rocked.

57:33.057 --> 57:36.127
Well, I'm glad we drove all the
way for this. This is great.

57:37.160 --> 57:38.829
Oh, this is kind of
disappointing.

57:39.095 --> 57:40.764
I mean,
I brought my party shirt, so...

57:43.100 --> 57:44.235
Bitches!

57:44.968 --> 57:46.170
Oh, God fucking damn it.

57:46.437 --> 57:48.437
Not Jeffrey.
Haven't you graduated yet?

57:48.439 --> 57:52.143
Graduating is for losers, bro.

57:52.943 --> 57:55.444
Who wants to go shove a
marshmallow up a freshman's ass?

57:57.914 --> 57:59.182
- Come on. Don't be gay.
- You hear that?

58:04.321 --> 58:05.356
Let's do this.

58:06.022 --> 58:07.988
Go! Go! Go!

58:32.982 --> 58:34.751
It's so weird
being back here.

58:35.051 --> 58:35.819
Right?

58:37.187 --> 58:39.821
Let's do
a "getting ready" selfie.

58:39.823 --> 58:41.823
The OGs run
through campus tonight.

58:41.825 --> 58:42.823
- Hell, yeah.
- Yeah.

59:11.522 --> 59:13.124
See? Didn't I tell you?

59:14.024 --> 59:15.259
Yes, you did.

59:17.894 --> 59:18.495
Hello, you.

59:19.463 --> 59:22.066
When are the...
When are the girls getting here?

59:22.332 --> 59:24.502
It would be nice to
hang out with Skylar.

59:25.868 --> 59:28.238
Yeah, I think I want to hang out
with Fatima, too.

59:28.972 --> 59:29.941
Bro, she's gross. Seriously.

59:33.142 --> 59:34.475
What the fuck, Joe?

59:34.477 --> 59:37.280
What? Oh, she is.
You both know it.

59:38.548 --> 59:39.916
But he likes her.

59:43.886 --> 59:45.022
It's the frat president,
Eric Stahl, yo.

59:45.421 --> 59:47.290
Yo, sick party, Eric.

59:48.392 --> 59:51.062
- Who the fuck are you?
- Joey.

59:53.463 --> 59:55.129
- I used to be a frat legend.
- You?

59:58.968 --> 59:59.870
I've never heard of you.

01:00:01.171 --> 01:00:02.839
And you're old as shit, bro.

01:00:03.207 --> 01:00:04.842
No fucking legend.

01:00:08.312 --> 01:00:10.145
- What up, guys!
- Hey, girls. Hi.

01:00:10.147 --> 01:00:11.349
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:12.348 --> 01:00:15.015
- Where's Fridge?
- He went inside 'cause...

01:00:15.017 --> 01:00:17.852
Shot-off!

01:00:17.854 --> 01:00:19.322
Let's go. Come on. Get inside.

01:00:19.923 --> 01:00:21.455
- I'm gonna go find Fridge.
- Okay.

01:00:21.457 --> 01:00:22.524
What's a shot-off?

01:00:22.526 --> 01:00:23.892
Drinks, ladies?

01:00:23.894 --> 01:00:25.060
Drinks, drinks!

01:00:25.062 --> 01:00:26.493
And shots. Drinks and shots.

01:00:26.495 --> 01:00:27.397
Shots and drinks.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.837
You gotta win this, bro. You gotta
prove that we're two rock stars.

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.039
There's a fucking live fish
in one of them.

01:00:36.372 --> 01:00:38.305
You look nervous.

01:00:38.307 --> 01:00:40.107
Come on, you first, bitch.

01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:42.509
Basically, you take
it in turns to drink a cup.

01:00:42.511 --> 01:00:44.314
Don't think
about it, just do it.

01:00:45.615 --> 01:00:47.517
Ohh!

01:00:49.986 --> 01:00:51.254
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

01:00:55.658 --> 01:00:59.361
- O-M-fucking-G, Brad Schlonghauser's here.
- Oh, no.

01:00:59.363 --> 01:01:00.832
Oh, yes.

01:01:01.131 --> 01:01:02.300
I need a drink.

01:01:04.301 --> 01:01:06.504
My favorite ladies.

01:01:07.004 --> 01:01:07.939
You miss me?

01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:09.506
Yeah.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.140
You girls are like a fine wine,
you only get better with age.

01:01:13.142 --> 01:01:14.345
Oh. Clever.

01:01:16.178 --> 01:01:18.615
I have a vineyard, but...

01:01:19.548 --> 01:01:23.086
why am I talking about wine when I
have champagne right in front of me?

01:01:24.053 --> 01:01:27.555
I'm feeling that old...
electric vibe...

01:01:27.557 --> 01:01:28.859
- Yeah.
- ...between us.

01:01:29.926 --> 01:01:34.397
It's making my heart beat...
like a drum kit.

01:01:35.598 --> 01:01:36.997
Oh.

01:01:36.999 --> 01:01:37.467
Okay.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:41.405
You feeling that?

01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:43.240
Feeling something.

01:01:44.207 --> 01:01:45.309
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:01:46.142 --> 01:01:47.278
To vomit.

01:01:55.017 --> 01:01:56.253
So, Brad,
how long are you in town for?

01:02:12.502 --> 01:02:14.205
When does
this awful game end?

01:02:19.743 --> 01:02:21.078
We won!

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:22.613
You wanna be a frat star?

01:02:24.147 --> 01:02:27.418
Go outside and do the
elephant walk with Jeffrey.

01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:30.484
- Right now!
- What is the elephant walk?

01:02:33.256 --> 01:02:36.424
Okay, so, are you gonna grab
my tail with your trunk,

01:02:36.426 --> 01:02:38.029
or am I grabbing your tail
with my trunk?

01:02:38.627 --> 01:02:40.397
Uh... You don't have a tail.

01:02:40.664 --> 01:02:42.432
Come on, just grab my cock.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.102
Come on, man!

01:02:50.173 --> 01:02:50.607
I, uh...

01:02:56.713 --> 01:02:59.550
I'm sorry, bro. I promise you, I'm a true
frat star, but I can't do this shit.

01:03:00.584 --> 01:03:02.549
Whoa! Yes!

01:03:02.551 --> 01:03:04.387
Come on, don't be gay, man!

01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:07.591
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:03:08.392 --> 01:03:10.227
- Oh.
- Hi, Amy.

01:03:10.727 --> 01:03:12.463
Skeazy Steve.

01:03:12.662 --> 01:03:15.098
Is that your new
naughty name for me?

01:03:20.169 --> 01:03:22.706
Hey, let me know if you wanna...

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.642
dance later.

01:03:26.676 --> 01:03:27.611
Yeah, I'll be sure
to do that.

01:03:29.245 --> 01:03:32.349
You know I'm talking about
fellatio when I say "dance."

01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:40.324
- I can't believe you...
- Shut up, Shu!

01:03:41.091 --> 01:03:43.461
Hello.
Have you seen Skylar anywhere?

01:03:43.827 --> 01:03:45.162
Yeah, I think she's inside.

01:03:45.562 --> 01:03:46.761
- Okay.
- Great.

01:03:46.763 --> 01:03:47.598
Try to find her.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.669
There he is!

01:03:52.169 --> 01:03:54.401
Why would you do that?

01:03:54.403 --> 01:03:57.205
Because it's fratty, baby,
'cause it's fratty.

01:03:57.207 --> 01:03:59.377
No, you are my new special
friend, Brit, you know that?

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:01.609
- Really?
- No, man, you gotta come stay at KOK

01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:04.412
because fucking Alpha Sigma
Sigma is fucking everything up.

01:04:04.414 --> 01:04:05.412
I'm gonna put
the cat in the car.

01:04:05.414 --> 01:04:06.649
Don't leave me with him.

01:04:07.617 --> 01:04:09.216
Tonight's gonna be
a special night, Brit.

01:04:09.218 --> 01:04:10.253
- Really?
- Yup.

01:04:10.754 --> 01:04:12.056
I'm getting a blumpkin.

01:04:12.321 --> 01:04:14.024
- A what?
- Blumpkin.

01:04:14.723 --> 01:04:15.658
What's that?

01:04:16.626 --> 01:04:18.763
- It's a blowjob from a chick.
- Oh, great. Good.

01:04:19.196 --> 01:04:20.398
While I'm dropping a dook.

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.403
- What?
- It's fucking legendary, man.

01:04:25.836 --> 01:04:28.671
No one, in the history of the
frat, has ever achieved it.

01:04:29.238 --> 01:04:30.807
- Really? Very surprising.
- No, no...

01:04:32.776 --> 01:04:34.111
I want you to get one with me.

01:04:35.211 --> 01:04:38.048
Oh, uh, thanks for the offer,
but I'm gonna pass.

01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.250
You'll go down in history, man.

01:04:42.252 --> 01:04:44.422
Yeah, not really what I
want to be remembered for.

01:04:47.289 --> 01:04:49.459
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
I tried to do the elephant walk.

01:04:50.861 --> 01:04:53.261
- I can't do that shit.
- Fucking loser!

01:04:53.263 --> 01:04:55.299
Okay, the only way
I'll forgive you,

01:04:55.631 --> 01:04:57.198
and the only way you'll be seen
as a frat star,

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.703
is if you get your bitch brother
to bang that cat.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.707
- That's fucking funny?
- No.

01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:08.178
That's the most pussy
he'll ever get.

01:05:11.347 --> 01:05:12.749
- All right, yeah. I'll make him do it.
- Fucking right!

01:05:13.582 --> 01:05:15.549
Oh, my God,
it's gonna be fucking awesome.

01:05:15.551 --> 01:05:17.352
Motherfucking cat!

01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:17.855
Whoo!

01:05:20.423 --> 01:05:21.625
What are you doing?

01:05:21.925 --> 01:05:23.193
I gotta make him do it.

01:05:24.194 --> 01:05:25.763
I gotta have Eric Stahl
look at me as cool.

01:05:26.763 --> 01:05:27.832
Whatever...
Whatever it takes.

01:05:29.098 --> 01:05:32.399
Eric Stahl is a fucking lunatic.
All right, what does it matter?

01:05:32.401 --> 01:05:34.604
Because I wanna be seen
as a frat legend again, okay?

01:05:35.738 --> 01:05:38.238
You know, you may not believe this,
but my life kind of sucks right now.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.609
This is all Young Joseph's got.

01:05:57.294 --> 01:05:58.395
Excuse me, mister.

01:05:59.461 --> 01:06:01.764
I ordered a stud muffin,
and I think you might be it.

01:06:05.368 --> 01:06:07.872
I know this great burrito place
around the corner.

01:06:09.805 --> 01:06:11.374
What do you say
we blow this popsicle stand?

01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:15.745
You had me at "burrito."

01:06:19.749 --> 01:06:21.651
Hey guys, how goes
the party stuff in here?

01:06:22.318 --> 01:06:24.854
Oh, man,
I'm fired up some, baby.

01:06:25.854 --> 01:06:26.623
What's up?

01:06:32.963 --> 01:06:34.962
Should you maybe be
a bit more subtle?

01:06:34.964 --> 01:06:36.767
Nah, no way, man.
You're in my house tonight.

01:06:37.566 --> 01:06:39.836
My rules. My rules.

01:06:53.249 --> 01:06:54.584
Are you following me
on Instagram?

01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:56.486
Seen all the badass things
I've been doing?

01:06:57.486 --> 01:06:59.722
- No.
- Did I tell you I drive a BMW now?

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.723
Don't care.

01:07:01.658 --> 01:07:02.760
You rip that, Brit.

01:07:03.627 --> 01:07:04.628
No, thank you.

01:07:04.827 --> 01:07:05.929
Rip it good.

01:07:06.363 --> 01:07:08.531
...vanity plates that say,
"Schlong."

01:07:09.899 --> 01:07:12.970
The "S" is a 5,
but... still dope.

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:16.606
Rip it, Brit. Rip that shit!

01:07:23.479 --> 01:07:24.747
- Rip it!
- Fuck it.

01:07:27.617 --> 01:07:28.519
God!

01:07:29.818 --> 01:07:31.454
Mmm! Yes!

01:07:31.787 --> 01:07:34.257
Oh, man, you are a maniac!

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:37.827
No, man, I didn't even know they
had fucking maniacs in the UK.

01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:44.299
- Yes.
- Oh!

01:07:44.301 --> 01:07:44.999
Baby!

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:47.067
That is some potent shit.

01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:49.837
That is good. That is good.
I'm going to have another one.

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:51.406
- Oh, man!
- Round two.

01:07:51.408 --> 01:07:52.674
Mm-hmm.

01:07:52.676 --> 01:07:54.408
I am a generous god, yes.

01:07:56.078 --> 01:07:59.479
Oh! Snagging it all
like a maniac.

01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:01.381
Oh, man, I have to go poop.

01:08:01.383 --> 01:08:02.719
It's go time.

01:08:03.653 --> 01:08:05.022
Poop time!

01:08:05.722 --> 01:08:08.691
Hello. Hello. Hello, you.

01:08:12.062 --> 01:08:13.931
Hello. Hello.

01:08:14.897 --> 01:08:16.667
Hey. How's it going?

01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:20.801
So, I mean, they just, like, you know,
they say just be a dick to her.

01:08:20.803 --> 01:08:22.336
I don't want to be a dick.

01:08:22.337 --> 01:08:23.138
Because I feel like
I'm a nice guy.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.671
But she's with
that handsome guy.

01:08:24.673 --> 01:08:25.908
She's treating me
like a dick, you know?

01:08:26.408 --> 01:08:27.911
I'm gonna...
I'm just gonna try to be a dick.

01:08:28.511 --> 01:08:29.312
I need to poop.

01:08:30.613 --> 01:08:31.881
It's so weird
how this drug does that, right?

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:33.883
You're just, like, sniff,
and you're like...

01:08:35.984 --> 01:08:37.287
Hey, there you are.

01:08:38.386 --> 01:08:40.423
What's up, Skylar?

01:08:40.756 --> 01:08:42.059
Nothing. What's up with you?

01:08:42.624 --> 01:08:45.492
Just doing drugs and shit.

01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:47.330
Gonna hit on some babes.

01:08:47.696 --> 01:08:49.496
Ew.

01:08:49.497 --> 01:08:50.934
All right,
I'm gonna go get a drink.

01:08:51.568 --> 01:08:52.368
Okay.

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:55.538
And score me a lighter.

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:58.640
Oh, no.

01:09:00.008 --> 01:09:01.477
Have you seen
a toilet round here?

01:09:04.613 --> 01:09:06.783
Ooh. Don't mind if I do.

01:09:08.885 --> 01:09:10.017
Ooh.

01:09:10.019 --> 01:09:11.321
It's nice. Quite calming.

01:09:12.323 --> 01:09:13.356
Everyone's so generous
with their narcotics.

01:09:14.857 --> 01:09:15.859
You seen the toilet?

01:09:16.091 --> 01:09:17.795
Brilliant. Thank you.

01:09:19.428 --> 01:09:20.962
Hello. Hello. Toilet?

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:22.399
This way?

01:09:23.966 --> 01:09:25.633
Oh, baby! There you are!

01:09:25.635 --> 01:09:27.033
Jesus, that's rank!

01:09:27.035 --> 01:09:28.635
Come on, man, it's not too late
to come join us.

01:09:28.636 --> 01:09:30.170
Oh, fuck.

01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:32.809
Mmm! It's happening.
Fuck, yes!

01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:36.109
Excuse me, do you know if there's
another toilet around here?

01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:38.680
Shut the fuck up,
you're Australian?

01:09:38.881 --> 01:09:40.581
- Uh, British.
- Shut up.

01:09:40.582 --> 01:09:44.117
I'm...
I'm Mimi.

01:09:45.854 --> 01:09:46.689
Oh, God.

01:09:49.993 --> 01:09:53.029
- Elliot.
- O-M-G, you're so hot.

01:09:53.761 --> 01:09:57.165
I'm gonna speak in a British
accent from now on.

01:09:57.167 --> 01:10:00.134
- No, no, there's no need.
- Would you like a spot of tea?

01:10:00.136 --> 01:10:02.039
Please, nurky, have some more.

01:10:04.039 --> 01:10:05.273
What is in that?

01:10:05.275 --> 01:10:08.045
So, Sir Elliot,
have you ever done Molly?

01:10:09.044 --> 01:10:13.180
- Uh, no.
- Don't lie, liar, liar, trousers on fire.

01:10:13.182 --> 01:10:14.816
You just did.

01:10:14.818 --> 01:10:18.021
What? No. Why'd you give me Molly?
I don't want that.

01:10:18.855 --> 01:10:20.520
Did we just have
a Molly moment?

01:10:20.522 --> 01:10:22.023
I don't know what we had.
I don't know what's happening.

01:10:22.025 --> 01:10:23.527
You want a light show?

01:10:23.959 --> 01:10:26.693
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

01:10:26.695 --> 01:10:28.865
Whoo-whoo!

01:10:29.966 --> 01:10:31.999
Fuck.
I think I'm hyperventilating.

01:10:32.001 --> 01:10:34.872
Oh, yeah, massage train, yeah!

01:10:35.171 --> 01:10:37.572
Oh, there you go,
right... Oh, yeah!

01:10:37.574 --> 01:10:40.110
- Suddenly I'm feeling awful.
- Do you have a phone?

01:10:40.577 --> 01:10:42.643
Get your phone.
Get your phone out.

01:10:42.645 --> 01:10:43.710
I can't feel my new phone.

01:10:43.712 --> 01:10:44.845
- I think I lost it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:44.847 --> 01:10:47.081
- My heart...
- Insta-moment, Molly-faces!

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:48.652
In the camera there.
There we go.

01:10:52.922 --> 01:10:54.491
Stop. Stop!

01:10:55.658 --> 01:10:56.924
- Stop.
- You rolling?

01:10:56.926 --> 01:10:58.128
No, I'm hyperventilating.

01:10:59.229 --> 01:11:00.862
- I don't know what's happening.
- Let's shag.

01:11:00.864 --> 01:11:02.229
- No.
- Come on.

01:11:02.231 --> 01:11:03.965
- No, please. Please.
- Come on. You know.

01:11:03.967 --> 01:11:05.099
- I need a doctor.
- I'm a doctor.

01:11:05.101 --> 01:11:06.533
- You pissed my bed.
- No, I didn't!

01:11:06.535 --> 01:11:07.602
- Yes, you did.
- What the...

01:11:07.604 --> 01:11:08.803
Yes.

01:11:08.805 --> 01:11:10.804
You lost my
fucking skateboard, too.

01:11:10.806 --> 01:11:12.141
I don't even know who you are.

01:11:13.676 --> 01:11:14.742
- You mother...
- What?

01:11:14.744 --> 01:11:15.879
He's mine.

01:11:16.779 --> 01:11:18.712
- You!
- I just needed the toilet.

01:11:18.714 --> 01:11:20.747
- Just pee your pants.
- I got your dick in my face!

01:11:20.749 --> 01:11:23.283
- Okay, enough fun.
- You gotta go to school.

01:11:23.285 --> 01:11:24.751
You try to get on the bus.

01:11:24.753 --> 01:11:26.022
The sex bus!

01:11:26.588 --> 01:11:28.889
Yes, you go to school.
You go to my school.

01:11:28.891 --> 01:11:29.857
Give me your arm, bitch.

01:11:29.859 --> 01:11:31.157
How are you so strong?

01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:33.193
I take kickboxing.
It's my hobby.

01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:34.564
You know, that, and knitting.

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:37.130
Knitting blankets
to have sex on!

01:11:37.132 --> 01:11:38.965
Oh, you shut up, you baby.

01:11:38.967 --> 01:11:40.768
Shut up! Shut up!

01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:41.969
Oh, here, look at the butterfly.
Yeah, look at the butterfly.

01:11:41.971 --> 01:11:43.904
Now, look at the butterfly.
Now, look at the butterfly.

01:11:43.906 --> 01:11:45.639
Now, look at the butterfly.
Now, look at the butterfly.

01:11:45.641 --> 01:11:46.807
- Now, look at the butterfly.
- Okay.

01:11:46.809 --> 01:11:47.778
Look at the butterfly.

01:11:48.043 --> 01:11:49.812
Ooh, look at the butterfly.
Ooh!

01:11:50.747 --> 01:11:52.679
- I think I'm having a panic attack.
- Oh, good, that'll help.

01:12:04.226 --> 01:12:05.895
I'm gonna turn you
into a man tonight.

01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:20.677
Prepare to enter my forest.

01:12:24.948 --> 01:12:25.915
I love you.

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:28.148
Look at the butterfly.
Look at the butterfly.

01:12:29.953 --> 01:12:30.954
Oh, yeah, boy!

01:12:31.954 --> 01:12:33.689
- Oh, my God, who is that?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

01:12:34.156 --> 01:12:37.127
- Whoa.
- Well, what do we have here?

01:12:40.663 --> 01:12:43.567
Here, buddy, hey.
My name's Jeffrey, with a J.

01:12:44.734 --> 01:12:46.870
Nice to meet you, I'm Elliot.
Please untie me.

01:12:47.235 --> 01:12:48.939
Can you help? Help.

01:12:49.638 --> 01:12:50.574
Help.

01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:52.575
Let's turn this into
a little threeway.

01:12:52.976 --> 01:12:54.841
- No. No, no, no.
- Oh, yeah.

01:12:54.843 --> 01:12:55.742
- Yes!
- No way!

01:12:55.744 --> 01:12:57.111
You're only young once, right?

01:12:57.113 --> 01:12:58.946
- I'm not even that young.
- Okay, look.

01:12:58.948 --> 01:13:00.950
- Untie me, please.
- Look at this mouth.

01:13:01.316 --> 01:13:03.651
- Look at... what? No.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:03.653 --> 01:13:05.051
- No.
- Like a vagina.

01:13:05.053 --> 01:13:06.056
- No, it's not.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:08.357 --> 01:13:11.658
Oh, your accent's
so fucking hot.

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.797
- Oh, keep talking how you do, baby.
- I don't...

01:13:15.797 --> 01:13:16.930
- Help!
- You know,

01:13:16.932 --> 01:13:18.601
my grandparents
are from Barcelona.

01:13:19.267 --> 01:13:20.971
Barcelona, England?

01:13:21.236 --> 01:13:22.638
Too right.

01:13:22.971 --> 01:13:24.840
- That's not in England.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:13:25.675 --> 01:13:26.243
Oh!

01:13:29.645 --> 01:13:30.780
You little minx.

01:13:33.815 --> 01:13:35.651
Come on, look. Here she is.

01:13:36.052 --> 01:13:38.685
Look, take her upstairs to a private
room and put on some music...

01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:41.091
Dude, I can't believe you got her out
of the car. You're sick in the head.

01:13:42.691 --> 01:13:44.026
I'm gonna go find Elliot.

01:13:44.927 --> 01:13:46.630
- Come on, Sky. Help me out.
- No.

01:13:47.963 --> 01:13:48.931
Oh.

01:13:49.798 --> 01:13:51.935
W... We're just dancing,
that's all.

01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:54.669
Hey, feel free to join us.

01:13:54.671 --> 01:13:57.106
I can easily dance
the tongue-go with two.

01:13:59.107 --> 01:14:00.877
Please don't tell anyone, Sky.

01:14:01.778 --> 01:14:04.347
My self-esteem's
been kind of low recently.

01:14:05.114 --> 01:14:07.050
Skeazy Steve.

01:14:07.749 --> 01:14:09.849
Get back to work.

01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:11.085
Hi.

01:14:13.989 --> 01:14:15.725
Help!

01:14:19.328 --> 01:14:21.094
Help!

01:14:21.096 --> 01:14:23.165
What the fuck is going on?

01:14:25.034 --> 01:14:26.103
No! No!

01:14:30.172 --> 01:14:31.807
I feel like
I'm being waterboarded.

01:14:32.742 --> 01:14:33.209
Stop!

01:14:35.744 --> 01:14:37.243
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:14:37.245 --> 01:14:38.949
- Oh! No!
- Oh, here we go.

01:14:39.147 --> 01:14:39.882
What the...

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:43.285
Oh, isn't his accent so cute?

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:46.120
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

01:14:46.122 --> 01:14:47.854
I did not want this to happen.

01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:49.055
Ew, you're already taken?

01:14:49.057 --> 01:14:50.224
No, wait! Skylar, wait!

01:14:50.226 --> 01:14:51.662
- Please!
- Get out!

01:14:52.796 --> 01:14:55.062
- Get out! Get out, you piece of shit!
- Get off!

01:14:55.064 --> 01:14:56.732
Get off me. Horrible man.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:00.336
Skylar. Skylar, wait!

01:15:00.869 --> 01:15:02.402
- Wait, I didn't... Wait!
- Go get her, bro!

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.013
Wait, Skylar. Please wait.

01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:14.948
- What?
- Well...

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:16.386
You know what, Elliot? I just
thought you were different.

01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:19.085
You looked at me like you cared,

01:15:19.087 --> 01:15:21.190
you opened doors for me, you
even listened to me when I talk.

01:15:22.324 --> 01:15:24.093
But really, you're just
like every other guy.

01:15:25.994 --> 01:15:27.698
I didn't realize you
even noticed that stuff.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.199
Just have fun, Elliot.

01:15:30.432 --> 01:15:32.002
It's not fair of me to get annoyed at you.
It's my own issue.

01:15:32.467 --> 01:15:33.936
Okay? Forget it.

01:15:37.205 --> 01:15:38.240
- Wait, but...
- Uh-uh.

01:15:39.275 --> 01:15:40.143
Skylar!

01:15:41.843 --> 01:15:43.477
Yo, El,
tell him to bang the cat.

01:15:43.479 --> 01:15:45.347
Dude, if it's so important,
<i>you</i> fuck the cat.

01:15:46.315 --> 01:15:47.050
What?

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.953
Okay, I can't take
this shit anymore.

01:15:50.218 --> 01:15:51.320
Whoa, what's up with you?

01:15:51.553 --> 01:15:53.821
I don't know! Uh...

01:15:53.823 --> 01:15:56.924
Maybe it could be the bisexual threeway
assault that just happened to me

01:15:56.926 --> 01:15:58.294
with the mouth-fingering.

01:15:59.628 --> 01:16:01.795
Or maybe it's the shot of a
fucking goldfish I had to drink.

01:16:01.797 --> 01:16:03.466
- Chill out, dude.
- Don't tell me to chill out.

01:16:04.132 --> 01:16:05.001
And why don't you grow up?

01:16:06.302 --> 01:16:08.238
You're 26
and you still act like a kid.

01:16:09.337 --> 01:16:10.473
Anyway, I don't care.

01:16:11.073 --> 01:16:13.974
Just bang the cat already, mate.
I'm over it.

01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:16.977
Yeah, just bang your
fucking cat, you bitch.

01:16:16.979 --> 01:16:18.414
Oh! Oh!

01:16:19.015 --> 01:16:21.148
Bang the fucking cat,
you motherfucker!

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:22.886
Don't you fucking touch him!

01:16:23.351 --> 01:16:25.585
Oh, hold... That's cool.
That's cool. That's cool.

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.421
And down he goes.

01:16:28.423 --> 01:16:30.424
For the one
and a two and a three!

01:16:30.426 --> 01:16:32.526
Baby, you see that shit?

01:16:32.528 --> 01:16:34.594
Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohh!

01:16:34.596 --> 01:16:36.132
Hey, you get off my brother.

01:16:37.165 --> 01:16:39.034
Motherfucker! What?

01:16:40.302 --> 01:16:42.036
I'm sorry.
There's no need for violence.

01:16:45.975 --> 01:16:46.510
Bitch!

01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:48.043
You bitch!

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:50.546
Son of a bitch!

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:53.283
Hey!

01:16:55.016 --> 01:16:56.218
Get off me!

01:16:58.186 --> 01:17:00.189
- Sorry!
- Hey, it's a sperm whale.

01:17:02.624 --> 01:17:04.261
- What, bitch?
- Fuck that!

01:17:05.461 --> 01:17:06.594
- Fuck! Oh, God.
- Yeah!

01:17:06.596 --> 01:17:08.031
Motherfucker!

01:17:08.431 --> 01:17:09.630
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:17:09.632 --> 01:17:11.564
I think you broke my nose,
you fuck!

01:17:11.566 --> 01:17:12.569
- Am I bleeding?
- You all right, dude?

01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:16.173
Little bitch!

01:17:16.538 --> 01:17:17.573
Fucking pussy bitch.

01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:26.045
Let's go fuck shit up!

01:17:33.288 --> 01:17:35.054
Oh, my God, my balls!

01:17:49.204 --> 01:17:50.339
Hey!

01:17:51.007 --> 01:17:53.506
'Cause he's a fucking
frat star, bro!

01:17:53.508 --> 01:17:55.444
You are an animal, bro!
Animal!

01:17:56.345 --> 01:17:57.379
Congratulations.

01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:01.948
Um. Go get me some brewskis
for me and my brothers.

01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:02.551
Yes, sir.

01:18:07.056 --> 01:18:08.357
Hey, we got a wedding to get to.

01:18:13.061 --> 01:18:17.197
Ellie, darling.
I love your shirt.

01:18:17.199 --> 01:18:19.532
My little P-I-M-P.

01:18:19.534 --> 01:18:20.568
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Seany, how are you?

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.973
- Guys, this is my mom.
- Hey, hey.

01:18:23.338 --> 01:18:25.639
- Hey, Jo-jo, I like the tattoo.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.075
You must be Refrigerator.

01:18:28.077 --> 01:18:29.111
Yes, milady.

01:18:29.611 --> 01:18:30.881
Is that Princess?

01:18:31.146 --> 01:18:33.617
Oh, hey! I've been looking
for Princess!

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.518
Why don't you take a look at the
new queen of the Davis household.

01:18:39.154 --> 01:18:40.923
- You are.
- Yeah.

01:18:43.693 --> 01:18:45.494
That's going to take
some getting used to.

01:18:46.028 --> 01:18:47.664
Oh, hey, El. Listen...

01:18:48.596 --> 01:18:51.967
I taped the English
football game.

01:18:52.534 --> 01:18:54.203
Maybe you and I could
look at it later.

01:18:54.537 --> 01:18:56.338
Uh... I don't really like football.
Thanks.

01:19:08.016 --> 01:19:08.984
God, you're hot.

01:19:10.186 --> 01:19:13.386
It's pretty, it's just...
Are you sure about this, Mom?

01:19:13.388 --> 01:19:15.589
I mean, the guy...
He's utterly crazy.

01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:18.261
Oh, yes,
that's what I love about him.

01:19:18.526 --> 01:19:19.760
Well, I'm crazy, too.

01:19:19.762 --> 01:19:21.495
And he loves that about me.

01:19:21.497 --> 01:19:24.967
I just want to love...
and be loved.

01:19:26.369 --> 01:19:28.535
I love you.
Isn't that enough?

01:19:28.537 --> 01:19:29.472
Darling...

01:19:32.074 --> 01:19:33.109
I'm sorry about Skylar.

01:19:35.711 --> 01:19:36.413
Me too.

01:19:37.712 --> 01:19:39.013
Really liked her.

01:19:39.015 --> 01:19:41.117
Really liked her.

01:19:41.516 --> 01:19:44.586
- Well, you should tell her then.
- It doesn't work like that, Mom.

01:19:45.553 --> 01:19:50.189
Girls like guys that are, like, cool
and have game. And that's just not me.

01:19:50.191 --> 01:19:52.962
Oh, none of that is true.

01:19:53.495 --> 01:19:55.528
People like people
who are nice to them

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:58.301
and who make them feel good
about themselves.

01:19:58.633 --> 01:20:01.667
So, you just be honest
and tell her how you feel

01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:04.039
and if she doesn't like it,
well then, she's rubbish

01:20:04.406 --> 01:20:05.475
and doesn't deserve you.

01:20:09.645 --> 01:20:11.580
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome, darling.

01:20:13.214 --> 01:20:14.484
Oh, here are the boys.

01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:16.282
Yeah?

01:20:16.284 --> 01:20:17.617
- Congratulations.
- How are you, pal?

01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:19.286
- Yeah. Mom.
- Darling.

01:20:19.288 --> 01:20:21.424
- Congratulations.
- Get in here. Get in here.

01:20:21.656 --> 01:20:22.691
Baby boy.

01:20:23.559 --> 01:20:24.758
- Hi.
- Mom.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:25.759
- Hey.
- Congratulations.

01:20:29.464 --> 01:20:31.167
I owe you an apology, Joey,

01:20:31.633 --> 01:20:32.534
for what I said.

01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:37.804
I just... If you haven't noticed, I've
been a bit stressed recently, and...

01:20:37.806 --> 01:20:41.774
it just seems like everyone else has
their life all sorted out and I don't.

01:20:41.776 --> 01:20:42.544
You know?

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.712
Is that one of those
rhetorical questions?

01:20:46.714 --> 01:20:49.416
No, no. We still need to talk about that,
'cause you don't understand that at all.

01:20:49.418 --> 01:20:52.185
I feel you though. I think
we're, like, the same person.

01:20:52.187 --> 01:20:55.290
Yeah. But I'm ready
to get my life together.

01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:57.092
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:20:58.293 --> 01:21:00.661
I mean, I'm officially a frat
legend now, after last night.

01:21:00.663 --> 01:21:02.795
- You are. Congratulations again.
- Thank you.

01:21:02.797 --> 01:21:03.599
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:05.801
Yeah. Come here.

01:21:09.305 --> 01:21:12.438
- You're all right.
- Yes, you're all right, too. That was nice.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.475
Hi, guys.
You both look very handsome.

01:21:15.477 --> 01:21:17.478
Yo, Sky, you know where I could get
some fucking blow for this party?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.115
- You're not doing coke at your dad's wedding.
- Fuck.

01:21:20.449 --> 01:21:22.316
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

01:21:22.318 --> 01:21:23.649
Hey, so how was the drive back?

01:21:23.651 --> 01:21:26.185
- Long.
- Yeah. Yeah...

01:21:26.187 --> 01:21:28.757
It was all right. It was...
The car stinks of vomit.

01:21:29.357 --> 01:21:31.358
- How was yours?
- It was long.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.395
We were exhausted.

01:21:33.428 --> 01:21:35.696
But look, I just really
wanted to say I'm sorry.

01:21:35.698 --> 01:21:37.734
Oh, you don't need
to say anything, honestly.

01:21:38.801 --> 01:21:41.434
We're gonna be really good friends,
which is better than anything, right?

01:21:41.436 --> 01:21:43.536
Uh... Right.

01:21:43.538 --> 01:21:45.671
Joey, your dad looks so happy.

01:21:45.673 --> 01:21:46.575
Yeah.

01:21:47.243 --> 01:21:48.278
I don't...

01:21:48.577 --> 01:21:50.713
- Okay, we need to talk.
- Okay.

01:21:50.913 --> 01:21:53.550
Honestly, I think
you're kind of a bitch.

01:21:53.815 --> 01:21:55.648
Oh, thank you.
Okay, well, likewise.

01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:58.220
But the fact is,
she likes you.

01:21:59.154 --> 01:22:00.389
So man the fuck up.

01:22:01.190 --> 01:22:03.860
Yeah, stop being so Hugh Grant,
bumsy about it.

01:22:04.293 --> 01:22:07.697
"Oh, sorry. Pardon me.
I need to use the loo."

01:22:08.163 --> 01:22:11.400
I do not need to use the toilet,
thank you very much.

01:22:11.766 --> 01:22:15.270
- "Spot of tea? Pip pip. Sorry."
- Okay, are you both done?

01:22:15.704 --> 01:22:17.574
Go get her, Elliot.

01:22:18.673 --> 01:22:20.443
- Go now.
- Okay, okay.

01:22:20.909 --> 01:22:23.613
- Go get her, Elliot.
- Oh, my God, okay. Okay.

01:22:24.613 --> 01:22:29.351
Ladies and dudes. Ladies and dudes.
Hang on a second. Hang on.

01:22:29.752 --> 01:22:33.256
I just got a few things to say.
Yeah, just file in there.

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:34.723
Uh...

01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:38.524
First of all, I just wanna say
that I'm in love

01:22:38.526 --> 01:22:40.594
with this little English rose
right over here.

01:22:42.263 --> 01:22:43.732
You bet. She's my queen.

01:22:44.499 --> 01:22:45.702
She's my Lady Di.

01:22:46.235 --> 01:22:47.637
She's my Hermione Granger.

01:22:48.971 --> 01:22:52.238
But only in HPot 5, 6, and 7. She's
too young in the early films.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.310
Way too fucking young.
I'm not like that.

01:22:57.579 --> 01:22:59.181
But listen,
I just wanted to say...

01:22:59.914 --> 01:23:02.918
that I am an artist
of the martial arts kind.

01:23:04.787 --> 01:23:07.323
And I wanted to express
my love to you...

01:23:08.457 --> 01:23:10.360
- in the form of karate.
- Oh.

01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:23.640
Want some, get some.

01:23:33.748 --> 01:23:34.783
That's my fucking dad.

01:23:35.618 --> 01:23:36.553
That's my dad.

01:23:50.999 --> 01:23:51.967
How are we related?

01:23:52.967 --> 01:23:53.635
How?

01:23:57.573 --> 01:23:58.208
Oh, my...

01:24:01.944 --> 01:24:02.946
Oh, shit.

01:24:03.512 --> 01:24:04.647
All right.

01:24:06.382 --> 01:24:07.317
Karate.

01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:09.419
Karate.

01:24:11.486 --> 01:24:12.254
Thank you.

01:24:13.455 --> 01:24:15.824
Hey, Elliot. Why don't you come
up here and say a few words?

01:24:19.628 --> 01:24:21.327
- Fabulous.
- Thanks.

01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:24.833
Sorry, quite a tough act to
follow, but... I just...

01:24:25.868 --> 01:24:27.503
I just really wanted to say...

01:24:29.305 --> 01:24:31.374
Mom, I'm so happy for you.

01:24:32.874 --> 01:24:34.441
I really am. You've...

01:24:34.443 --> 01:24:38.010
You've found a...
a wonderful man in Michaelson.

01:24:38.012 --> 01:24:40.949
And Sean... Joey...

01:24:42.618 --> 01:24:45.555
If I'm honest, I really didn't
want to come and meet you.

01:24:46.087 --> 01:24:49.990
Because I... I didn't really
understand how important family was.

01:24:49.992 --> 01:24:51.457
He's talking about me.
I'm his little brother.

01:24:51.459 --> 01:24:52.895
But after
what we've been through...

01:24:54.329 --> 01:24:56.265
I realize it's the most
important thing in the world.

01:24:57.999 --> 01:25:00.770
And Skylar, uh...

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.475
Hit it!

01:25:07.609 --> 01:25:09.943
No, just play something...
Right, thank you.

I don't have to sing, you're right.

01:25:49.118 --> 01:25:52.051
I... I realized that
just after I'd started,

01:25:52.053 --> 01:25:55.725
and then I just carried on, 'cause,
you know, "When in Bismarck..."

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.062
What I'm trying to say is...

01:26:01.763 --> 01:26:03.833
I think you're the most
incredible girl I've ever met.

01:26:05.868 --> 01:26:09.638
If you would just give me
one more chance to "man up,"

as they say,

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:15.011

I like you...

01:26:15.476 --> 01:26:17.814
- Aww.
- Yeah.

01:26:22.517 --> 01:26:23.519
A little awkward.

01:26:23.718 --> 01:26:24.820
Feels... It feels awkward.

01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:35.895
Go, girl!

01:26:35.897 --> 01:26:36.865
- Pull it out.
- Keep going.

01:26:40.668 --> 01:26:42.536
Boy, your plan worked.

01:26:42.538 --> 01:26:43.969
Well, I knew the right girl was
out there for him somewhere.

01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:46.141
- We just had to go and get her.
- Yes.

01:26:48.543 --> 01:26:49.111
Kiss.

01:26:50.111 --> 01:26:51.614
Right here. Yeah.

01:26:52.815 --> 01:26:53.816
Fuck off.

01:26:56.118 --> 01:26:56.953
Oh!

01:26:59.788 --> 01:27:00.556
No.

01:27:01.856 --> 01:27:03.559
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:27:09.096 --> 01:27:09.998
There you go.

01:27:14.970 --> 01:27:16.038
That will never happen again.

01:27:18.006 --> 01:27:18.841
In public.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.114
Ew.

01:27:27.815 --> 01:27:29.017
Well, that was ridiculous.

01:27:29.485 --> 01:27:29.919
...ly good.

01:27:37.758 --> 01:27:39.658
That's a cool move!

01:27:44.565 --> 01:27:46.668
So, your mom said
you might be staying.

01:27:47.769 --> 01:27:50.603
Well, you see, there's kind
of this girl I'm into.

01:27:50.605 --> 01:27:51.804
Oh, yeah?

01:27:51.806 --> 01:27:53.773
So, not so worried
about the future then?

01:27:53.775 --> 01:27:55.845
Mmm.
Kind of enjoying the moment.

01:27:58.046 --> 01:28:00.779
That's right. Hey, El!

01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:03.250
Want you to meet my new neighbor.
He came by to say congrats.

01:28:03.252 --> 01:28:05.585
Came by to say, "What's up!"

01:28:05.587 --> 01:28:06.122
You!

01:28:06.788 --> 01:28:09.492
You nasty freak motherfucker!

01:28:10.758 --> 01:28:11.961
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

01:28:12.761 --> 01:28:13.663
Oh, my God.

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:22.234
- I am not a pedophile.
- What?

01:28:23.739 --> 01:28:24.674
Mark.

01:28:25.106 --> 01:28:26.805
Ugh. Did you just...

01:28:26.807 --> 01:28:27.976
Sorry.

01:28:32.314 --> 01:28:33.950
Ugh. Did you just queef?

01:28:40.122 --> 01:28:42.322
- Ew. What's on your finger?
- It's from that.

01:28:42.324 --> 01:28:44.260
Ew. Ugh.

01:28:45.193 --> 01:28:47.562
Meet us somewhere tomorrow
at noon.

01:28:48.696 --> 01:28:49.962
I'm sorry.

01:28:49.964 --> 01:28:52.068
I'm actually
slightly allergic.

01:28:52.767 --> 01:28:55.568
- Holy shit! I am sorry!
- No.

01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:57.239
- I'm so sorry!
- No. It's okay.

01:28:58.673 --> 01:29:00.075
Oh, come here. Come here.

01:29:02.677 --> 01:29:03.211
Damn thing.

01:29:03.945 --> 01:29:05.547
Oh, fuck.

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:07.883
I'm scared as shit of cats.

01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:09.752
I'm not touching
that thing again.

01:29:10.017 --> 01:29:11.620
Scene 17, take one, alpha.

01:29:12.354 --> 01:29:13.588
Bravo.

01:29:14.589 --> 01:29:16.191
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
account for my balls?

01:29:23.931 --> 01:29:25.066
Stupid.

01:29:25.633 --> 01:29:26.269
You hear that?

01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:38.377
<i>Key alpha, take one.
So, put an A beside the 20...</i>

01:29:38.379 --> 01:29:39.949
- Side down?
- So, we're doing this thing again?

01:29:42.383 --> 01:29:44.854
- Twenty.
- Alpha, take one.

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:47.323
- <i>Correct.</i>
- And slates, tail slates.

01:29:47.788 --> 01:29:48.990
- <i>Side down.</i>
- Side down.

01:29:53.695 --> 01:29:54.564
Do you get it?

01:30:01.369 --> 01:30:02.037
I'm sorry.

01:30:10.345 --> 01:30:11.777
- I held...
- Are you fucking laughing?

01:30:11.779 --> 01:30:13.145
- I held it...
- You fucking bitch.

01:30:13.147 --> 01:30:14.848
I held it
most of the time.

01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:16.052
You guys have
never done it before.

01:30:17.084 --> 01:30:20.155
If you have...
it just comes flushing out.

01:30:21.323 --> 01:30:23.659
- I'm a squirter.
- Ew!

01:30:25.293 --> 01:30:27.129
I'm... Sorry.

01:30:28.396 --> 01:30:29.297
That's really...

01:30:29.730 --> 01:30:31.063
Great.

01:30:32.199 --> 01:30:33.301
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.

01:30:34.369 --> 01:30:36.036
- Drive, drive, drive!
- No, no. I'm so high.

01:30:36.038 --> 01:30:37.039
I'm high as fuck, please.

01:30:40.074 --> 01:30:40.943
Go!

01:30:48.249 --> 01:30:49.448
Oh. Oh.

01:30:49.450 --> 01:30:50.716
- Then we go.
- Cut.

01:30:50.718 --> 01:30:51.153
Hand on ass.

01:30:51.986 --> 01:30:52.952
Cutting!

01:30:52.954 --> 01:30:54.824
You nasty motherfucker!

01:31:01.997 --> 01:31:05.868
Your heart feel like it explode.

01:31:06.802 --> 01:31:08.401
Why am I doing Italian?
I don't know.

01:31:10.172 --> 01:31:11.140
Rolling.

01:31:13.141 --> 01:31:14.307
Did we get the first part?

01:31:14.309 --> 01:31:16.276
- The smells don't change.
- Oh, shit!

01:31:42.937 --> 01:31:44.239
Oh, look at you.

01:31:45.873 --> 01:31:47.443
You big poo.

01:31:57.785 --> 01:31:58.453
Sorry.
