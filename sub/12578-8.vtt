00:38.467 --> 00:40.433
( horns honking )

00:40.500 --> 00:42.800
( honking continues )

00:42.867 --> 00:44.600
( brakes screech )

00:46.033 --> 00:47.300
YEAH! ( chuckles )

00:47.367 --> 00:49.467
( cheering and laughing )

00:49.533 --> 00:50.800
Bill:
DALE JUST WON
BY A HAIR.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.300
SHE IS POWER...

00:52.367 --> 00:54.467
ENORMOUS
YELLOW POWER.

00:54.533 --> 00:58.200
I FEEL LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE'S
BEEN LEADING TO THIS DAY.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.500
SO, LET'S SEE HOW YOU GUYS DID.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.867
Bill:
IT'S THE BIGGEST SEPTIC TANK
THEY HAD.

01:02.933 --> 01:06.067
THEY SOLD ONE JUST LIKE IT
TO A BOWLING ALLEY IN AUSTIN.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.800
GUY TRIED TO PUT US
IN A LITTLE HOME UNIT.

01:08.867 --> 01:10.933
I TOLD HIM, "YOU
DON'T KNOW BILL."

01:11.067 --> 01:13.067
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT HE SAID.

01:13.067 --> 01:16.267
Hank:
IT'S A SHAME WE HAVE TO
PUT HER IN THE GROUND.

01:19.967 --> 01:23.233
( sighing ):
I SHOULD'VE HIT THE OLD TANK
BY NOW, BILL.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.600
ARE YOU SURE
YOU SURVEYED IT PRECISELY?

01:25.667 --> 01:27.067
UH... SURE.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.800
I MEAN, TH-THAT'S
MY RECOLLECTION, MM-HMM.

01:30.867 --> 01:32.067
( sighs )

01:32.067 --> 01:33.467
OH, THERE--
THAT'S WHERE IT IS.

01:33.533 --> 01:34.900
( chuckling ):
MY MISTAKE.

01:34.967 --> 01:35.967
SORRY.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.267
MAYBE THE TANK'S IN THE FRONT.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.267
I DON'T KNOW.

01:45.333 --> 01:46.600
( sighs )

01:46.667 --> 01:49.500
YOU JUST KILLED YOUR
WHOLE BACK LAWN...

01:49.567 --> 01:51.400
A PERFECTLY
INNOCENT LAWN.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.700
OKAY, BIG SHOT,
WHERE'S YOUR TANK?

01:53.767 --> 01:55.133
SIDE LAWN, EIGHT FEET OUT

01:55.200 --> 01:57.467
NINE FEET SEVEN INCHES
FROM THE PAVEMENT.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.600
"SIDE LAWN."

01:58.667 --> 02:00.100
MINE'S ON THE SIDE LAWN,
TOO.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.267
( Hank sighs )

02:01.333 --> 02:03.100
BILL, YOU CAN'T
JUST MARK IT

02:03.167 --> 02:04.967
WHERE YOU THINK
IT MIGHT BE.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.633
THAT'S NOT REAL MARKING.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.300
THE FLAG IS IN.

02:08.366 --> 02:10.800
Dale:
I AM THE HOE MASTER.

02:10.866 --> 02:12.433
HEAR ME HOE.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.467
DALE, NO!

02:14.867 --> 02:16.067
( Dale screams )

02:18.067 --> 02:19.867
OH!

02:19.933 --> 02:21.267
HANK?

02:21.333 --> 02:24.133
HANK, YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT IT BEING COMPLICATED

02:24.200 --> 02:26.633
BUT WRONG TO MAKE ME WANT
TO TRY IT SO BADLY.

02:26.700 --> 02:27.967
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:28.067 --> 02:30.433
TO BUY THE "L" PIPES
FOR YOUR SEPTIC TANK.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.300
ROAD TRIP.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.800
YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

02:32.867 --> 02:33.633
CAN I COME?

02:33.700 --> 02:35.633
NO.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.700
I'LL STAY
IN THE TRUCK.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.300
AW, HE'S RIGHT.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.833
I NEVER WOULD'VE
STAYED IN THE TRUCK.

02:44.133 --> 02:45.467
NO, THAT'S A
STRAIGHT PIPE.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.967
I'M LOOKING FOR
AN "L" PIPE.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.400
Ls ARE STRAIGHT.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.467
( sighing):
LOWERCASE,
MAYBE, BUT...

02:50.533 --> 02:53.600
OKAY, FINE.
I'M LOOKING FOR
A CAPITAL-L PIPE.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.200
IT BENDS, AT
A RIGHT ANGLE.

02:55.267 --> 02:56.400
PIPES DON'T BEND.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.100
ALL PIPES ARE STRAIGHT.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.867
ALL PIPES CAN'T BE STRAIGHT.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.267
IF THEY WERE, YOUR
DEPARTMENT STORE

03:02.333 --> 03:04.533
WOULDN'T BE SELLING
THOSE "U" PIPES

03:04.600 --> 03:06.200
RIGHT BEHIND
YOUR SHOULDER.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.367
THOSE AREN'T PIPES.

03:08.433 --> 03:10.200
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THERE IS MORE
THAN ONE SIZE BIT.

03:10.267 --> 03:13.733
A "PLUMBING ASSOCIATE"
THEY'RE DIFFERENT-
SIZE HOLES.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.100
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT A PIPE IS?

03:22.733 --> 03:24.067
Man:
WHAT THE...?

03:25.900 --> 03:26.833
STUPID, DUMB...

03:26.900 --> 03:28.333
NICE TRUCK.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.633
DOES THE JOB...

03:29.700 --> 03:31.200
THEN SOME.

03:31.267 --> 03:33.400
DID YOU GET THE RECALL
NOTICE ABOUT THE BELTS?

03:33.467 --> 03:34.400
BACK IN '94?

03:34.467 --> 03:35.400
YEP.

03:35.467 --> 03:36.633
GOT IT.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.467
SO... PICK UP SOME KIND
OF "L" PIPE?

03:38.533 --> 03:40.133
YEP, TWO-AND-
A-QUARTER INCH.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.133
SEPTIC?

03:41.200 --> 03:42.133
( chuckles ):
YEAH.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.200
IT'S MY NEIGHBOR'S.

03:43.267 --> 03:44.633
WE RENTED A
LOADER BACKHOE

03:44.700 --> 03:45.867
FOR THE JOB.

03:45.933 --> 03:47.467
I HEAR MASON'S GOT
A NEW DESIGN.

03:47.533 --> 03:48.667
THAT'S WHAT
I RENTED.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.467
WELL... THEN,
I WON'T KEEP YOU.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.367
Luanne:
SO, THEN,
MY PROFESSOR SAYS

03:59.433 --> 04:01.933
TO ME THAT I HAVE THE
GREATEST POTENTIAL

04:02.067 --> 04:05.067
OF ANY JUNIOR COLLEGE
STUDENT THAT HE'S EVER SEEN

04:05.133 --> 04:06.800
AND, THEN, HE ASKED ME TO DINNER

04:06.867 --> 04:09.067
TO TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE...
AND DRINKS!

04:09.067 --> 04:10.067
( laughs giddily )

04:10.067 --> 04:11.667
DINNER AND DRINKS?

04:11.733 --> 04:13.067
LUANNE...

04:13.067 --> 04:15.067
HONEY, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

04:15.067 --> 04:17.733
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING ABOUT?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.067
OH, WELL...
( chuckles )

04:19.132 --> 04:20.067
I MET A GUY.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.067
UH-HUH?

04:21.132 --> 04:22.467
YEAH, AT THE MEGA LO MART.

04:22.533 --> 04:25.467
WE HAVE THE SAME TRUCK,
SAME YEAR, SAME COLOR.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.067
SMART GUY, TOO.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.067
HE KNEW
WHAT AN "L" PIPE WAS FOR.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.333
IT WAS NICE.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.733
ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.067
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.600
YOU KNOW, IT WAS
JUST A ONE-TIME THING

04:34.667 --> 04:35.900
WITH A GUY IN A PARKING LOT.

04:35.967 --> 04:38.167
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S ALL.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.067
HEY... L-PIPE,
HOW YOU DOING?

04:46.100 --> 04:48.767
YOU, UH, FILLING UP
WITH SUPER?

04:48.833 --> 04:50.067
REGULAR.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.133
JUST KIDDING.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.133
OH.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.133
( laughing )

04:53.200 --> 04:54.333
( sighs uneasily )

05:07.700 --> 05:09.067
HEY, UH...

05:09.067 --> 05:11.167
YOU GOT SOMEPLACE
YOU NEED TO BE OR...

05:11.233 --> 05:13.100
MAYBE YOU WANT TO...
GRAB A BEER?

05:13.167 --> 05:15.100
IMPORTED?

05:15.167 --> 05:16.100
WHAT?!

05:16.167 --> 05:17.100
N-NO, NO, DOMES...

05:17.167 --> 05:18.267
( laughing ):
OH...

05:18.333 --> 05:19.433
( laughing )

05:19.500 --> 05:20.600
"IMPORTED."

05:20.667 --> 05:21.467
( chuckling )

05:21.533 --> 05:22.967
I GOT TO WATCH YOU.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.567
( country-blues on juke box )

05:39.267 --> 05:42.533
YOU KNOW, PEGGY,
WE'RE HAVING THE BEST TIME.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.867
NO, WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

05:44.933 --> 05:46.833
NO, HE DIDN'T MENTION IT.

05:46.900 --> 05:49.067
THAT DIDN'T COME UP, EITHER.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.067
LOOK, I'LL BE HOME LATER.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.833
Man:
* Well, listen to me, doll *

05:53.900 --> 05:55.533
♪ Before you start to whine ♪

05:55.600 --> 05:58.600
♪ That side's yours
and this side's mine ♪

05:58.667 --> 06:00.933
♪ Move it on over ♪♪

06:01.067 --> 06:02.733
Dale:
MORE...

06:02.800 --> 06:04.467
MORE...

06:04.533 --> 06:05.867
MORE...

06:07.533 --> 06:08.400
IS IT OPEN?

06:08.467 --> 06:09.900
ALMOST.
TRY AGAIN.

06:09.967 --> 06:12.733
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:14.333 --> 06:15.867
GET OUTTA THERE.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.067
( sighs )

06:20.067 --> 06:22.267
DID YOU STOP TO THINK THAT
MAYBE THE BACKHOE WASN'T

06:22.333 --> 06:24.267
THE BEST TOOL FOR
OPENING UP A BEER CAN?

06:24.333 --> 06:26.100
YEAH, HANK, I DID.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.133
THAT... OH!

06:29.200 --> 06:30.133
MAN.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.400
HANK DID IT.

06:31.467 --> 06:32.400
( sighs )

06:32.467 --> 06:34.067
WHAT WOULD
YOU GUYS THINK

06:34.133 --> 06:36.733
IF SOMEONE HAD A BEER
WITH US OUT HERE?

06:36.800 --> 06:39.933
LIKE SOMEONE JUST WANDERS
OVER, LIKE A STRANGER?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.933
NO, NO,
THIS GUY I KNOW.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.067
GOOD GUY.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.333
IT'S A BIG ALLEY.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.833
BOY, HANK SURE
DOES SEEM EXCITED.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.933
HAL, THIS IS DALE,
BILL AND BOOMHAUER.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.067
HEY, FELLAS.

06:59.067 --> 06:59.833
YO.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.067
SAY, LOOK, UH...

07:01.067 --> 07:02.633
HANK TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION

07:02.700 --> 07:05.067
AND I WAS THINKING YOU COULD
JUST USE A METAL DETECTOR...

07:05.067 --> 07:06.567
TRACE THE PIPES
BACK TO YOUR TANK.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.233
( laughing )

07:08.300 --> 07:10.600
"A METAL DETECTOR"?

07:10.667 --> 07:13.067
THE DETECTOR
WOULD GO OFF CONSTANTLY

07:13.067 --> 07:14.533
DUE TO THE HIGH LEVELS

07:14.600 --> 07:17.067
OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL ALLOY
IN OUR SOIL

07:17.067 --> 07:20.600
WHICH ACTS AS A HOMING BEACON
TO THE MARTIAN CAPITAL

07:20.667 --> 07:23.867
OF ( rolls tongue)
( spitting ) ( gulps ) CITY.

07:23.933 --> 07:25.867
( laughing uneasily )

07:25.933 --> 07:27.433
YEAH, YEAH...

07:27.500 --> 07:29.433
THAT'S A GOOD JOKE, DALE.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.533
DALE SURE CAN TELL A JOKE.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.867
HEY, YOU KNOW, ON THE WAY OVER

07:33.933 --> 07:35.667
I PASSED THIS HUGE TRACKHOE--
14-TONNER.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.267
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO CHECK HER OUT?

07:37.333 --> 07:40.267
SORRY, BUT WE'VE GOT BUSINESS
TO TRANSACT.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.333
I'LL GO.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.333
HANK'S GOING
TO COME BACK...

07:53.400 --> 07:54.333
NOW.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.733
NOPE.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.067
NOW.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.500
NOPE.

08:01.567 --> 08:02.800
THIS IS DANG
OLD PATHETIC.

08:02.867 --> 08:04.333
DON'T WE GOT BETTER
THINGS TO DO

08:04.400 --> 08:06.067
THAN SITTING AROUND
ON THAT DANG OLD ( word )

08:06.067 --> 08:08.967
TALKING ABOUT OLD
( speaking gibberish )?

08:09.067 --> 08:10.067
LATER.

08:12.067 --> 08:16.667
I'M SURPRISED BOOMHAUER STAYED
AS LONG AS HE DID.

08:24.533 --> 08:25.533
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
YEP.

08:31.533 --> 08:32.533
( clattering )

08:36.267 --> 08:37.600
( groans )

08:37.667 --> 08:39.167
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

08:39.232 --> 08:43.467
OH... SO YOU CARE
WHAT WE'RE DOING, DO YOU?

08:43.533 --> 08:45.067
HE DOESN'T CARE.

08:46.533 --> 08:48.067
YOU SAID
YOU'D BE BACK

08:48.067 --> 08:49.300
IN A MINUTE.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.633
WE WAITED
A MINUTE.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.467
THEN, WE WAITED ANOTHER.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.600
AND, THEN,
AFTER ABOUT A MILLION MINUTES...

08:55.667 --> 08:57.700
I FORGOT WHY I WAS COUNTING.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.333
WELL, WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL?

08:59.400 --> 09:01.667
YOU DON'T GET UPSET
WHEN I COME HOME LATE FROM WORK.

09:01.733 --> 09:05.067
ONE, WE GET VERY UPSET
WHEN YOU WORK LATE

09:05.133 --> 09:07.767
AND, TWO,
YOU WERE OUT WITH HIM.

09:07.833 --> 09:11.767
DIDN'T YOU THINK
PEGGY MIGHT BE WORRIED

09:11.833 --> 09:14.100
YOU BEING
GONE SO LONG?

09:14.167 --> 09:15.133
I CALLED HER.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.600
YEAH, WELL...

09:24.200 --> 09:26.067
WE'RE BEING PHASED OUT.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.067
OUT.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.900
HA!
OW!

09:28.967 --> 09:30.933
DO NOT WATCH THE EYES,
BOBBY.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.867
THE EYES CANNOT
BE TRUSTED.

09:32.933 --> 09:34.667
"FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.

09:34.733 --> 09:35.800
FOOL ME TWI..."

09:35.867 --> 09:36.800
( slap )
OW!

09:36.867 --> 09:38.200
HEY, PEGGY.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.133
HAL JUST TOOK ME
TO THIS STORE

09:40.200 --> 09:42.467
THAT ONLY SELLS
FIREPLACE HARDWARE.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.933
"FIREPLACE HARDWARE"?

09:44.067 --> 09:46.467
BOOMHAUER MUST'VE BEEN
IN HOG HEAVEN.

09:46.533 --> 09:47.900
UH... YEAH

09:47.967 --> 09:50.700
WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
INVITE BOOMHAUER...

09:50.767 --> 09:53.233
OR BILL OR... DALE,
FOR THAT MATTER.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.567
MOM!

09:54.633 --> 09:55.600
WHAT?

09:55.667 --> 09:57.100
PART OF THE FUN
WITH HAL IS

09:57.167 --> 09:58.933
DOING NEW STUFF
WITH SOMEONE NEW

09:59.067 --> 10:01.367
AND IF THE GUYS CAN'T
HANDLE THAT, WELL...

10:01.433 --> 10:03.100
THAT'S WHY I
DON'T TELL THEM.

HANK.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.800
SO, WHERE'S THAT
BAIT-AND-TACKLE SHOP

10:18.867 --> 10:20.100
YOU WON'T
SHUT UP ABOUT?

10:20.167 --> 10:22.200
FALSE ALARM, HANK.
WENT LAST NIGHT.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.433
THEY DIDN'T KNOW A FLOATER
FROM A SINKER.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.600
NOW, YOU WANT
TO SEE A GREAT NEW STORE

10:26.667 --> 10:29.600
MAKE A LEFT AT THE LIGHT,
THEN OUT TO McMAINERBERRY--

10:29.667 --> 10:31.367
SPORT SHOP THAT SPINS AROUND.

10:31.433 --> 10:33.367
USED TO BE
A RESTAURANT.

10:33.433 --> 10:34.433
HMM.

10:37.767 --> 10:41.033
10:15-- HANK
PICKS UP HAL.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.000

10:47.067 --> 10:48.200
Bill:

10:48.267 --> 10:52.200
I SAID,
"10:15-- HANK PICKS UP HAL"!

10:54.300 --> 10:56.200
( gasps )
HANK AND HAL, I SEE.

11:00.867 --> 11:03.333
SO, THIS GUY IS TRYING
TO FILL A SERVICE TANK...

11:03.400 --> 11:04.767
UH-HUH?

11:04.833 --> 11:08.133
AND THE DRIP-LIP VENT IS
IN THE 6:00 POSITION.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.467
INSTEAD OF 12:00?

11:09.533 --> 11:10.767
EXACTLY.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.933
YOU SURE YOU NEVER
WORKED IN PROPANE?

11:13.067 --> 11:14.667
HOBBY,

11:16.733 --> 11:18.633
Dale:

HANK?

12:27.267 --> 12:29.233
HAL?

12:32.067 --> 12:33.533
THAT WAS OUR PROJECT.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.467
YOU SHOULD BE
THANKING ME.

12:35.533 --> 12:36.500
HAL WORKED

12:36.567 --> 12:38.067
THAT BACKHOE SO FAST

12:38.067 --> 12:40.133
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE
A COUPLE DAYS' RENTAL.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.167
YEAH, AND WITH
THE MONEY YOU SAVE

12:42.233 --> 12:44.167
YOU CAN BUY
YOUR FRIEND HAL

12:44.233 --> 12:45.500
A DOZEN ROSES.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.500
NOW YOU'RE BUYING
HIM ROSES?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.833
THAT'S IT, HANK.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.267
IT'S US OR HIM.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.533
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME CHOOSE.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.800
US OR HIM?

12:53.867 --> 12:54.800
ALL RIGHT, HIM.

12:54.867 --> 12:57.067
"HIM" MEANS HAL, YOU KNOW.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.200
THAT'S THE WAY
WE PHRASED THE QUESTION.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.567
YOU, UH, THINK
WE WENT WRONG

13:06.633 --> 13:08.200
MAKING HIM CHOOSE?

13:08.267 --> 13:09.900
WHERE WE WENT WRONG

13:09.967 --> 13:12.667
IS NOT STAYING
WITH THAT BACKHOE.

13:12.733 --> 13:16.467
WHOEVER CONTROLS THE
BACKHOE CONTROLS HANK.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.467
YOU THINK?

13:17.533 --> 13:19.200
YES, I DO THINK.

13:19.267 --> 13:22.400
AS LONG AS WE'RE--
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD--

13:22.467 --> 13:26.467
"INCOMPETENT" WITH THE BACKHOE,
WE WILL BE HANKLESS.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.267
I KNOW A PLACE
WE CAN PRACTICE.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.133
THE ARMY'S GOT
AN OLD MINE FIELD.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.433
NO ONE'S EVER THERE.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.233
DON'T BE INSANE, BILL.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.567
WE'LL NEVER GET
PAST SECURITY.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.400
BUT I KNOW AN
ABANDONED PET CEMETERY

13:38.467 --> 13:40.300
WITH OUR NAMES ON IT.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.633
NICE HOLE, BILL.

ALL RIGHT.

14:12.133 --> 14:13.733

14:15.567 --> 14:17.067
( men screaming )

14:20.900 --> 14:22.333
MAYBE WE COULD, UH

14:22.400 --> 14:24.500
HOLD ON TO THAT
TREE BRANCH

14:24.567 --> 14:26.067
AND SWING OUT
OF THE HOLE

14:26.133 --> 14:27.900
LIKE A MONKEY
IN THE JUNGLE.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.067
( screaming )

14:38.767 --> 14:40.200
HELP!

14:40.267 --> 14:41.533

14:41.600 --> 14:43.067
SOMEONE...!

14:43.100 --> 14:44.300
HELP!

14:44.367 --> 14:45.400
AH, FORGET IT.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.067
NO ONE CAN HEAR US

14:47.067 --> 14:49.300
OR IF THEY CAN,
THEY DON'T CARE.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.400
YOU'RE LUCKY.

14:50.467 --> 14:51.833
YOU'RE IN THE ARMY.

14:51.900 --> 14:54.733
YOU'VE GOT A TRACKING DEVICE
IN YOUR TEETH.

14:54.800 --> 14:55.967
THEY'LL FIND YOU.

14:56.067 --> 14:57.533
I'LL TELL THEM
WHERE YOU ARE.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.200
YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.933
HAL, IT'S HANK.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.200

15:04.467 --> 15:06.533
UH, WELL, NO,

15:06.600 --> 15:09.533
MY WIFE WILL HAVE DINNER
READY IN AN HOUR

15:09.600 --> 15:11.867
AND YOU'RE OVER
20 MINUTES AWAY.

15:11.933 --> 15:13.367
YEAH. NEXT TIME.

15:13.433 --> 15:15.367

15:15.433 --> 15:16.933
SO, BOBBY

15:17.067 --> 15:18.467

15:20.433 --> 15:22.200
I'LL GET MY BOX!

15:22.267 --> 15:25.067
HANK, YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO WATCH BOBBY SHINE YOUR SHOES.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.200
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO

15:27.267 --> 15:29.067

BOOMHAUER.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.433

17:55.233 --> 17:56.500
( sighing )

17:56.567 --> 17:59.200
I'M GOING TO MISS
THAT CRAZY BASTARD.

17:59.267 --> 18:01.067
( squawking )

18:03.967 --> 18:05.800
WE INVESTED
ALL THAT TIME

18:05.867 --> 18:08.900
AND EFFORT MAYBE
IN HANK

18:08.967 --> 18:11.400
AND HE HAS FORSAKEN US.

18:11.467 --> 18:13.567
WELL, EVERYTHING FORSAKES ME.

18:13.633 --> 18:17.100
I MEAN, SOMETIMES I,
I THINK I SHOULD JUST...

18:17.167 --> 18:19.567
STOP PUTTING MYSELF OUT THERE.

18:19.633 --> 18:22.067
WE DON'T NEED HANK.

18:22.133 --> 18:26.333
WE ARE TWO BETA MALES
AT THE TOP OF OUR GAME!

18:26.400 --> 18:28.933
AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION
THAT WE'RE LOVABLE

18:29.067 --> 18:32.067
AND THAT I'VE GOT
A LOT OF LOVE TO GIVE.

18:32.133 --> 18:33.333
I KNOW!

18:35.600 --> 18:37.967
HOW'S THE MARKET
BEEN TREATING YOU, SIR?

18:38.067 --> 18:40.267
I TOOK A PRETTY BIG HIT TODAY.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.800
I GOT WORRIES.

18:41.867 --> 18:43.533
( knock at door )

18:45.633 --> 18:48.067
WHERE'S MY BACKHOE, HANK?

18:48.067 --> 18:49.267
HEY. HOW ARE YOU?

18:49.333 --> 18:50.600
YOU WANT TO HAVE A BEER?

18:50.667 --> 18:52.300
I WANT MY BACKHOE.

18:52.367 --> 18:56.467
IT WASN'T RETURNED
BY DALE GRIBBLE
OR BILL DAUTERIVE?

18:56.533 --> 18:57.867
NO.

18:57.933 --> 18:59.200
I SAW THEM DRIVE OFF

18:59.267 --> 19:00.867
ON JOYRIDE WITH BACKHOE.

19:00.933 --> 19:03.300
YOU MEAN, THEY MISSING?

19:03.367 --> 19:05.733
MINH. YEAH, HEY, MINH.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.100

19:44.067 --> 19:45.367
HUH?

19:45.433 --> 19:46.400
THERE'S GOT TO BE

19:46.467 --> 19:48.700
SOMETHING TO EAT
IN THAT BOX.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.133
( chuckles ):
WHAT...?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.867
LOOKS LIKE A FUN PROJECT.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.267
( both groan )

19:55.333 --> 19:57.400
IT IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

19:57.467 --> 19:59.833
WE WERE JUST ON
OUR LUNCH BREAK

19:59.900 --> 20:00.967
WHICH IS OVER

20:01.033 --> 20:02.700
SO, IF YOU DO NOT MIND

20:02.767 --> 20:05.200
WE WILL BE GETTING
BACK TO WORK.

20:05.267 --> 20:06.200
Bill:
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

20:06.267 --> 20:07.633
DID YOU SEE IT MOVE?

20:07.700 --> 20:09.533
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.533
BUT BEFORE I GO,
I AM CURIOUS.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.867
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY
OF DRIVING OUT

20:13.933 --> 20:15.333
OF THAT HOLE?

20:16.533 --> 20:18.300
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE

20:18.367 --> 20:19.800
WITH THIS MACHINE THAN ME.

20:19.867 --> 20:21.700
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WOULD IT BE BETTER

20:21.767 --> 20:23.400
TO WIDEN THE HOLE
BEYOND THE TREE

20:23.467 --> 20:25.367
THEN EXTEND THE BOOM,
PLANT THE BUCKET

20:25.433 --> 20:26.633
LET OUT THE OUTRIGGERS

20:26.700 --> 20:28.867
THEN RELEASE AND
REPLANT THE BUCKET...?

20:28.933 --> 20:30.133
WAIT, WAIT, WE'LL...

20:30.200 --> 20:32.400
WE'LL HUMOR
YOUR LITTLE EXPERIMENT

20:32.467 --> 20:34.633
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO SLOW DOWN.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.467
ON YOUR LEFT THERE, PULL
THE EXTENDER AS FAR BACK...

20:37.533 --> 20:38.533
LEFT, IS IT?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.900
YEAH, THE LEVER CLOSEST TO ME.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.567
TAKE THAT IN YOUR HAND.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.400
GOOD.

20:52.867 --> 20:53.933
( both groaning )

20:54.000 --> 20:55.333
MY LEGS.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.000
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T MOVED
IN ABOUT 50 HOURS.

20:58.067 --> 21:01.700
THANKS, BUT NO THANKS,
HAL'S FRIEND.

21:01.767 --> 21:04.467
WHERE IS HAL?

21:04.533 --> 21:07.133
HUH, HANK?

21:09.767 --> 21:11.367
HAL'S GONE.

21:11.433 --> 21:12.533
YEP.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.100
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.067
YOU THINK
YOU CAN IGNORE ME

21:16.133 --> 21:19.067
FOR TWO DAYS AND THEN
ACT LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?

21:19.067 --> 21:21.933
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
YOU GUYS ARE SOMETHING

21:22.067 --> 21:24.467
HAL WILL NEVER BE--
MY NEIGHBORS.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.667
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

21:32.933 --> 21:36.267
Bill:
FRIENDSHIP IS
OUR COUNTRY'S SWEETEST WINE.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.800
Hank:
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE VERY DELIRIOUS.

21:44.067 --> 21:47.067
SO, I WAS THINKING,
ON THE BACKHOE RENTAL

21:47.133 --> 21:49.533
YOUR FRIEND HAL
SHOULD CHIP IN.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.533
I MEAN, HE USED IT, TOO.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.433
Hank:
I CAN PUT YOU
BACK IN THE GROUND.

22:30.233 --> 22:31.333
( Dale gurgling )

22:31.400 --> 22:32.833
( spits, gulps )

22:33.305 --> 22:39.346
