01:44.680 --> 01:45.920

At the same time,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.649
I have sent out word.

But warriors don't
show their heart,

21:19.880 --> 21:22.201

You are so wise, Floki.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.841
(CHUCKLES)

21:28.360 --> 21:32.206

21:43.720 --> 21:45.449
Floki must be happy?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.880
He's not happy?
Why is he not happy?

21:50.560 --> 21:55.646
It's complicated.
Floki is complicated.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.125

21:59.560 --> 22:02.962
Yes. Yes, we will.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.361

Earl Ragnar's blessing?

22:05.440 --> 22:08.523
My love does not think that he
needs Earl Ragnar's blessing.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.049
Only that of the gods.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.045
I have some
interesting news.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.768
Floki is angry
with Ragnar.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.291
Floki? Floki
loves Ragnar.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.761
Hmm.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.485
Ragnar Lothbrok is no longer
alone in attacking our shores.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.441
Hmm.

23:02.600 --> 23:06.650
He is still the greatest
disturbance to our world.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.407
And very likely to return here.
Mmm.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.084
We must be
prepared for him.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.364
If his army
lands in Northumbria,

23:14.440 --> 23:16.090
I will come at
once to your aid,

23:16.160 --> 23:18.322
and trust that you
will do the same for me.

23:22.640 --> 23:28.170
I'm not alone in fearing your
true ambitions, King Ecbert.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.764
It has been said that

23:31.840 --> 23:35.367
gaining the throne of Wessex was
never going to be enough for you.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.401
Go on.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.164
That you will never rest
until you are made Bretwalda,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.049
king of all the Britons.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.245
And that even now

23:47.720 --> 23:52.009
you have plans to attack
the kingdom of Mercia.

23:58.440 --> 23:59.566
Leave it.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.282
All of you, leave.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.691
(CHUCKLES)

24:12.360 --> 24:16.410
Mercia is a neighbor of mine,
as it is of yours,

24:16.480 --> 24:19.131
so you know very well
what is happening there.

24:20.200 --> 24:24.808
Since the death of King Offa, the
kingdom has fallen into turmoil,

24:24.880 --> 24:27.804
with several members of his
family competing for the throne.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.521
Offa's son and heir has been
murdered by his own sister,

24:31.600 --> 24:36.845
and it seems there is no end to
the violence and the chaos there.

24:37.600 --> 24:41.685
It suits neither of us
to have such an unstable

24:41.760 --> 24:43.683
and tumultuous neighbor.

24:44.600 --> 24:49.083
But if you and I
joined together,

24:49.160 --> 24:52.562
not only against the Northmen,
but also against Mercia,

24:52.640 --> 24:55.041
we should surely
overcome it.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.807
Mmm.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.724
We could then divide
Mercia up between us,

24:59.800 --> 25:01.404
as we saw fit.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.606
What do you say?

25:06.240 --> 25:12.361
I say after we
have conquered Mercia,

25:12.440 --> 25:15.887
what is to stop you from
turning on your smaller ally?

25:40.080 --> 25:43.323

25:44.840 --> 25:47.161

Let us drink to our alliance.
