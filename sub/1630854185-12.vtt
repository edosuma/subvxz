WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:08.490
* And so you're back,
from outer space *

00:08.690 --> 00:10.760
* I just walked in
to find you here *

00:10.960 --> 00:13.030
* With that sad look
upon your face *

00:13.230 --> 00:14.730
(continues over speakers):
* I should have changed
that stupid lock *

00:14.930 --> 00:16.430
* I should've made you
leave your key... *

00:16.630 --> 00:19.430
* With my sis,
doing my hair. *

00:19.630 --> 00:20.800
(laughing):
You're so crazy.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Okay, you know what?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.700
Oh. Oh, wait.
Come here. Get in here.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.470
Only you would want to take
a picture looking like this.

00:25.670 --> 00:26.960
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.310
Okay.
(laughing)

00:28.510 --> 00:29.760
Okay, scary face.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.180
Okay.
All right, all right.

00:31.380 --> 00:32.850
Okay.
Okay, classic beauty.

00:33.050 --> 00:33.910
Aw.

00:34.110 --> 00:35.380
Oh, my beautiful sis.

00:35.580 --> 00:36.650
Oh, I love it,
I love it.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.050
(clattering)
We're great, we're great.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.250
We're fabulous,
we're fabulous, totally.

00:39.450 --> 00:40.350
Did you hear that?

00:40.550 --> 00:41.720
* I will survive *

00:41.920 --> 00:43.120
Oh, Mimi,
it's just the wind.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.290
(clattering)

00:44.490 --> 00:45.460
No.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.690
I heard something in the back.

00:47.890 --> 00:48.890
Or somebody.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.380
I already locked up
for the night, honey.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.630
* I will survive... *
(clattering)

00:53.830 --> 00:56.050
(whispering):
You hear that?

00:57.120 --> 00:58.000
Do you think someone broke in?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.170
I...

01:00.370 --> 01:02.180
* *

01:02.380 --> 01:05.390
Stay right there.

01:05.990 --> 01:07.000
(coughing)

01:07.760 --> 01:08.610
Sasha?

01:08.810 --> 01:10.580
(coughing)
Sasha. Are you okay?

01:10.780 --> 01:11.520
(gasping)

01:11.720 --> 01:13.620
(both coughing)

01:13.820 --> 01:15.390
* Walk out the door *

01:15.590 --> 01:20.090
* Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore *

01:20.290 --> 01:23.500
* Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with goodbye? *

01:23.700 --> 01:25.700
* You think I'd crumble *

01:25.900 --> 01:27.470
* You think I'd lay down
and die? *

01:27.670 --> 01:31.440
* Oh, no, not I,
I will survive *

01:31.640 --> 01:35.970
* I'll survive,
I will survive... *

01:36.180 --> 01:38.540
WOMAN:
"Because now she
was confused and afraid

01:38.740 --> 01:40.650
"and wondering if what
she thought she'd heard

01:40.850 --> 01:43.780
wasn't what Bertie
had said at all."

01:43.980 --> 01:45.680
(monitor beeping)

01:45.880 --> 01:49.000
And we will find out
what happens next...

01:50.810 --> 01:52.810
...same time tomorrow.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.020
(monitor alarm beeping)

02:06.990 --> 02:08.340
Mimi? Nurse!

02:08.540 --> 02:09.940
Mimi?

02:10.140 --> 02:11.340
Hi. Hi.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.560
NURSE:
Call the attending.
She's waking up.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.120
WOMAN:
Mimi.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.500
(elevator bell dings)

02:18.100 --> 02:19.150
Ready?

02:19.350 --> 02:20.350
Ready!

02:20.550 --> 02:21.800
Yeah, let's do it.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.940
(laughing)

02:26.280 --> 02:27.460
Whoa.

02:27.660 --> 02:29.630
Oh, that's a
little bruiser.
(laughing)

02:29.830 --> 02:30.930
What-what's she in for?

02:31.130 --> 02:32.300
Breaking and entering,

02:32.500 --> 02:33.670
her mother's room.
Ah.

02:33.870 --> 02:35.130
My granddaughter
doesn't want to stay

02:35.330 --> 02:36.300
in her own bedroom,
right?

02:36.500 --> 02:37.700
Is that true?

02:37.900 --> 02:38.900
(laughs)

02:39.100 --> 02:40.840
Yeah, so Lindsey's
a little tired.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.010
I said I would take Hannah
on my day off and...

02:44.210 --> 02:46.180
of course Max wanted
to see me today.
HANNAH: Ready?

02:46.380 --> 02:47.180
Ah.
Yeah.

02:47.380 --> 02:48.550
Favor. Can you just...

02:48.750 --> 02:50.720
entertain her for, like,
five minutes is all?

02:50.920 --> 02:51.820
Mm-hmm.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.520
Thank you.
I'll be right back, okay?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.170
Pinky's in the bag.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.890
Pinky.
How old are you?

03:00.090 --> 03:01.730
Eight? 11?

03:01.930 --> 03:03.100
Pineapple.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.500
That's wild.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.520
I'm pineapple
years old too.
Whoa.

03:07.280 --> 03:11.140
ROBY:
So, this child psychiatrist,
Dr. Auerbach,

03:11.340 --> 03:12.540
you think this one little doodle

03:12.740 --> 03:14.640
means that she's behind
all these killings?

03:14.840 --> 03:17.540
I'm not ready to say that, yet.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.050
But look at it, Max.
That was in her notes.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.650
ROBY:
It does look like
all those silver glyphs

03:21.850 --> 03:22.680
that've been popping up.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.950
What's her explanation for this?

03:24.150 --> 03:25.320
She's out of town,

03:25.520 --> 03:27.490
at a psychiatric conference
until Thursday.

03:27.690 --> 03:28.690
You ought to meet her
at the airport,

03:28.890 --> 03:30.590
see what she has
to say for herself.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.660
Catherine.
You look rested.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.860
Must've been that morning
I took off.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.500
Sorry about that.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.300
Um... but
there's this case,

03:39.500 --> 03:40.630
actually, an old case,

03:40.830 --> 03:42.100
and you're gonna want in on it.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.600
It's old, but it couldn't wait
until tomorrow?

03:43.800 --> 03:44.800
It's waited four years.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.810
The incident happened
January of 2019,

03:48.010 --> 03:50.080
and CSI never investigated it.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.180
I don't understand.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.000
A crime during my tenure?

03:54.730 --> 03:56.650
Coroner said noxious fumes

03:56.850 --> 03:58.480
from a hair treatment
killed this woman

03:58.680 --> 04:01.820
and that her sister
slipped into a coma.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.360
This is my handwriting.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.560
I remember
this.
It happened
the same night

04:05.760 --> 04:07.790
as a major pile-up on I-15.

04:07.990 --> 04:10.730
Remember? And-and folks here
were just stretched thin.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.600
No signs of forced entry.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.800
LVPD let it drop.
You know how it is.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.140
Not every borderline case
gets the full-court press.

04:17.340 --> 04:20.410
This file hasn't been touched
in four years. What changed?

04:20.610 --> 04:21.410
During those four years,

04:21.610 --> 04:23.710
Mimi Kahn was in a coma.

04:23.910 --> 04:25.210
She woke up two days ago.

04:25.410 --> 04:27.150
She says that her sister's death
was not an accident.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.850
And they are exhuming
the body as we speak.

04:30.050 --> 04:31.420
Well, I want to talk with her.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.190
Kind of thought you might.

04:33.390 --> 04:34.520
(Hannah laughing)

04:34.720 --> 04:35.820
HANNAH:
Peekaboo!

04:36.020 --> 04:36.890
(gasps)

04:37.090 --> 04:38.490
Rarr!

04:38.690 --> 04:39.890
Rarr!
(yells)

04:40.090 --> 04:40.830
(laughing)

04:41.030 --> 04:43.300
Catherine.
She's adorable.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.130
Right? Hannah,

04:45.330 --> 04:47.870
I have to take care of
one more thing, okay?

04:48.070 --> 04:50.170
So, um...

04:50.370 --> 04:51.570
since you're between cases,

04:51.770 --> 04:53.340
could one or both of you
keep an eye on Hannah

04:53.540 --> 04:54.640
just for a little while?
Look up there.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.740
There's snacks
and toys

04:56.940 --> 04:58.940
and a change of
clothes in the bag.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.350
Okay?

05:00.550 --> 05:01.850
FOLSOM:
Uh, just asking...

05:02.050 --> 05:03.420
for how long?
WILLOWS: An hour.

05:03.620 --> 05:05.050
Uh, two hours tops.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.000
Definitely less
than three.
Okay.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.170
Bye, Grandma.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.340
Let's play.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.060
FINADO:
Okay, be prepared.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.300
(coughing)

05:17.500 --> 05:19.300
Oh, nope. Mm-mm.
Tap me out.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.570
Dock my pay.
I don't care.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.170
Come on. Big boy pants.

05:22.370 --> 05:23.200
I'm with Beau on this one.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.170
Bodies from mausoleums are ripe.

05:24.370 --> 05:25.300
(coughing)

05:25.500 --> 05:26.740
Ms. Kahn was embalmed

05:26.940 --> 05:28.070
and hermetically sealed
in that box.

05:28.270 --> 05:30.040
The stench of formaldehyde
is still so strong.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.710
It's not just coming
from her body.

05:31.910 --> 05:34.030
Take a look at
Sasha's hairline.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.550
See?
FINADO: It almost looks like
it kept growing

05:36.750 --> 05:38.450
after she died.
I didn't think that was a thing.

05:38.650 --> 05:41.190
JACK:
It's not. Her scalp dried out
and shrank after she died.

05:41.390 --> 05:44.560
Which is how we can see exactly
where her processed hair ends.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.020
It makes sense.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.590
She died in the middle
of a keratin treatment.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.090
I use Pert Plus.
You're gonna have to translate.

05:49.290 --> 05:52.470
We're looking at two forms
of formaldehyde here.

05:52.670 --> 05:54.070
JACK:
One in her body
for the embalmment,

05:54.270 --> 05:55.470
<i>the other one</i>
<i>applied to her hair</i>

05:55.670 --> 05:56.700
<i>for the chemical straightening.</i>

05:56.900 --> 05:57.800
How do you
know this stuff?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.340
My sister has curly hair.

05:59.540 --> 06:00.670
And I pay attention.

06:00.870 --> 06:02.440
The assistant M.E.
at the time

06:02.640 --> 06:04.040
ruled it an accident.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.810
She said it was an overexposure
to the chemicals used.

06:06.010 --> 06:08.510
But her sister woke up
convinced that it was murder,

06:08.710 --> 06:10.050
so, uh...

06:10.250 --> 06:13.450
he didn't happen
to mention how, exactly?

06:13.650 --> 06:14.620
I'll take a run at it,

06:14.820 --> 06:16.520
but I am not optimistic.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.290
Sasha was fully embalmed.

06:18.490 --> 06:19.960
Her arteries and organs
were drained,

06:20.160 --> 06:21.460
then plumped back up
full of formaldehyde,

06:21.660 --> 06:25.600
glutaraldehyde, methanol,
ethanol, phenol and water.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.700
There's not much of the original
Sasha Khan left to examine.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.100
If you want answers,
you're probably

06:29.300 --> 06:30.340
gonna have to go back
to the crime scene.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.670
It's nearly four years old.

06:31.870 --> 06:34.040
Geriatric crime scene.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.540
Sounds like a good time to
get back up the horse, huh?

06:36.740 --> 06:37.880
Lovely invitation, boss.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.180
I told you: I'm a lab rat.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.480
We don't ride horses.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.010
No.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.670
* *

06:45.870 --> 06:46.820
Mimi Khan?

06:47.020 --> 06:48.620
I'm Catherine Willows
with CSI.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.190
This is Detective Serena Chavez.

06:50.390 --> 06:51.190
We're very sorry

06:51.390 --> 06:52.530
for your loss.

06:52.730 --> 06:53.690
Thank you.
And that it's taken us
this long

06:53.890 --> 06:55.230
to investigate what happened.

06:55.430 --> 06:58.260
Well, you're here now.
Thank you. Hi, I'm Heather.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.030
Hello.
Doctor says
you were with Mimi

07:00.230 --> 07:02.270
when she woke up.
That's very lucky.

07:02.470 --> 07:03.870
Odds were pretty good.

07:04.070 --> 07:04.940
They always said there
was a chance Mimi

07:05.140 --> 07:06.640
would come out of it, so I...

07:06.840 --> 07:09.370
She came and read to me.
Every day.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.380
WILLOWS:
Ah.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.740
Could you hear her?

07:11.940 --> 07:13.480
I-I don't think so.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.950
But we were reading <i>Beaches,</i>

07:15.150 --> 07:16.750
and I was
thinking about

07:16.950 --> 07:18.680
Bette Midler when I woke up,

07:18.880 --> 07:20.720
so something
was getting through.

07:20.920 --> 07:21.890
HEATHER:
She was ventilated.

07:22.090 --> 07:22.960
Her mouth is dry.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.490
You want a mint?
No, no.

07:24.690 --> 07:26.060
No, that's okay.

07:26.260 --> 07:27.730
Doctors said that your coma
was caused

07:27.930 --> 07:29.660
by severe systemic toxicity.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.760
And Sasha went
through the same thing,

07:31.960 --> 07:33.670
except the chemicals
were on her scalp.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.480
It was too much.

07:37.490 --> 07:40.220
What do you think happened
that night?

07:41.660 --> 07:42.880
Well, I...

07:43.080 --> 07:46.310
I already told the police.

07:46.510 --> 07:52.970
I-I've done keratin treatments
in my salon for years.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.890
This was different.

07:56.090 --> 07:59.660
My sister and I
were poisoned.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.380
This was murder.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.260
I'm not sure I understand
what's being alleged.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.870
All we have is a report
from first responders.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.430
A Good Samaritan was
walking by your salon,

08:09.640 --> 08:11.890
saw you and your sister
on the floor and called 911.

08:12.820 --> 08:15.770
Some... someone or-or...

08:15.970 --> 08:18.580
something...

08:18.780 --> 08:21.760
broke into the salon
that night.

08:23.370 --> 08:27.040
Before I blacked out,
I saw a monster.

08:28.540 --> 08:29.450
A monster?

08:29.660 --> 08:31.420
Mm-hmm.

08:31.620 --> 08:34.760
It-it was Sasha's husband Ken.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.500
He did this.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.730
He killed her. I-I know it.

08:38.930 --> 08:41.170
HEATHER:
It was so long ago.

08:41.370 --> 08:42.500
Do you think that
it's too late

08:42.700 --> 08:44.600
to find out what
really happened?

08:44.800 --> 08:46.820
To find the truth? No.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.190
It's never too late.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.430
* *

08:58.300 --> 09:01.520
* Who... are you? *

09:01.720 --> 09:04.060
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:04.260 --> 09:07.030
* Who... are you? *

09:07.230 --> 09:09.090
* Who, who, who, who? *

09:09.290 --> 09:10.800
* I really wanna know *

09:11.000 --> 09:13.100
* Who... are you? *

09:13.300 --> 09:15.130
* Oh-oh-oh *
* <i>Who...</i> *

09:15.330 --> 09:18.040
* Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you *

09:18.240 --> 09:21.520
* Are you! *

09:26.930 --> 09:29.150
No luck finding
a sitter?
ROBY: Please.

09:29.350 --> 09:31.150
Grandmas are the reigning
queens of babysitters.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.450
WILLOWS:
It's just gonna be a
couple hours before I get

09:33.650 --> 09:34.650
Hannah back to Lindsey, right?

09:34.850 --> 09:35.720
And it's not like
Bryan didn't see

09:35.920 --> 09:37.460
a bunch of minor
crime scenes

09:37.660 --> 09:39.220
when he was a kid,
and he's okay.
That's right.

09:39.420 --> 09:40.790
This one's not
even fresh, come on.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.880
(laughing)

09:45.180 --> 09:46.450
Wow.

09:49.320 --> 09:54.010
No one's set foot in here for
four years since Sasha died?

09:54.210 --> 09:55.640
The sisters own the building.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.480
It's just been sitting
here empty while

09:57.680 --> 09:59.080
Mimi's health
was in limbo.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.080
ROBY:
I mean, come on.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.250
You got to love this.

10:01.450 --> 10:02.580
(laughs) Yeah, well,

10:02.780 --> 10:03.920
lots of things
get better with age.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.620
I know it's
counterintuitive,

10:05.820 --> 10:06.820
but a crime scene
is one of them,

10:07.020 --> 10:08.820
if it's
well-preserved.

10:09.020 --> 10:11.990
DNA and prints just waiting
to be collected.

10:12.190 --> 10:14.560
It doesn't seem like
there's been much

10:14.760 --> 10:16.730
human interference
since the paramedics

10:16.930 --> 10:18.000
wheeled the sisters out of here.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.330
Little chance
of degradation of prints

10:20.530 --> 10:21.720
or DNA.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.340
Oh, oh. Hannah,
Hannah, Hannah.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.970
Oh.
ROBY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:26.170 --> 10:27.740
Hey, you know what?

10:27.940 --> 10:29.740
Why don't we both go outside
and we'll look

10:29.940 --> 10:32.650
for clues and we'll
maybe get a snack?

10:32.850 --> 10:33.650
Yeah?

10:33.850 --> 10:34.750
How about you stay and I'll...

10:34.950 --> 10:35.680
Oh, yes, Yes, yes, yes.
Hannah.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.950
Hey, should we go outside?

10:37.150 --> 10:38.820
Okay, I'll see you
a little later.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.750
Let's go outside.
Wow. After you, my love.

10:40.950 --> 10:42.390
HANNAH: Yeah.
PARK: Oh, hi.

10:42.590 --> 10:44.420
WILLOWS:
Oof, this dust.

10:44.620 --> 10:45.620
It's everywhere.

10:45.820 --> 10:46.690
ROBY:
Yep.

10:46.890 --> 10:48.360
And it's not even my birthday.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.060
It's actually
my birthday next week.

10:50.260 --> 10:51.460
Yeah?

10:51.660 --> 10:54.230
And, look, I got you
a pre-dusted crime scene.

10:54.430 --> 10:55.630
PARK: I feel like,
uh, the desert air

10:55.830 --> 10:57.940
and the passage of time
ought to take the credit,

10:58.140 --> 10:59.240
but thanks.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.670
Mimi told us that she

11:00.870 --> 11:02.540
mopped up after
the last customer,

11:02.740 --> 11:05.110
so every footprint
was made after the fact,

11:05.310 --> 11:08.180
and the oils they left
prevented dust collection.

11:08.380 --> 11:10.680
Each set is gonna tell the story

11:10.880 --> 11:13.020
of who was here
in the salon after hours

11:13.220 --> 11:14.350
the night that Sasha died.

11:14.550 --> 11:15.920
The victim did say
she saw the murderer

11:16.120 --> 11:17.390
shortly before
she lost consciousness.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.760
A monster, actually.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.290
She said she saw a monster.

11:21.490 --> 11:23.460
Monster prints, then.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.030
I'll keep a lookout.

11:25.230 --> 11:26.060
We can rules these out.

11:26.260 --> 11:27.650
That's paramedics.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.990
(clanking)

11:30.890 --> 11:32.200
Two down.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.240
A zillion to go.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.190
* *

11:42.030 --> 11:44.670
(camera clicking)

11:53.510 --> 11:54.690
ROBY:
What you got?

11:54.890 --> 11:56.950
A birthday present.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.900
And it reeks
of formaldehyde.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.550
ROBY:
Ooh, thank you.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.040
FOLSOM:
Hey, Beau.
Hey.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.540
Figured you could
use a hand processing

12:07.740 --> 12:08.770
the products from the salon.

12:08.970 --> 12:10.340
Yeah, it's
starting to stack up.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.580
We barely even scraped
the crime scene,

12:11.780 --> 12:13.110
we've already got
an exhumed body,

12:13.310 --> 12:14.250
a bottle seal,

12:14.450 --> 12:16.010
bottles of shampoo
and conditioner,

12:16.210 --> 12:17.380
and a Panamanian Perm.

12:17.580 --> 12:20.550
Oh, it must be like
a Brazilian blowout.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.890
Okay, that
doesn't help me.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.690
I-I don't even know if
that's a noun or a verb.

12:23.890 --> 12:27.460
It's a noun.
"I just got a Panamanian Perm."

12:27.660 --> 12:29.430
Noun.
Noun.

12:29.630 --> 12:30.630
Anyway,

12:30.830 --> 12:32.500
it's either an
embarrassment of riches

12:32.700 --> 12:34.730
or a colossal
waste of time.

12:34.930 --> 12:36.230
Well, around here, Beau,

12:36.430 --> 12:38.040
we choose to
be optimists.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.560
* *

12:57.870 --> 12:59.060
FOLSOM:
Looks like Mimi was right.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.890
Someone did tamper
with the keratin bottle.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.260
Too much CH2O?

13:02.460 --> 13:04.930
Yeah. Way too much.
How'd you know that?

13:05.130 --> 13:06.970
This puppy's drenched
in formaldehyde.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.670
Somebody must've
spiked the treatment.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.170
But even if the killer
added extra formaldehyde

13:11.370 --> 13:13.040
to the formaldehyde that
was already in the bottle,

13:13.240 --> 13:15.470
how'd he know it'd be enough
to poison the two sisters?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.210
Well, I know there's
0.7mg per 100g

13:18.410 --> 13:19.710
of formaldehyde
in Coca-Cola.

13:19.910 --> 13:21.150
And I know
that formaldehyde

13:21.350 --> 13:23.620
played a pivotal part in
Jonas Salk defeating polio,

13:23.820 --> 13:25.950
but I don't know that.

13:26.150 --> 13:27.390
(instrument beeping)
Oh.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.860
FOLSOM:
And... no formaldehyde

13:30.060 --> 13:31.620
in the shampoo
or conditioner.

13:31.820 --> 13:32.930
No, but you
know what is

13:33.130 --> 13:34.330
in those bottles?
Whole bunch of stuff

13:34.530 --> 13:36.180
that shouldn't be.

13:36.710 --> 13:37.860
FOLSOM:
You're right.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.230
Almost none of
the ingredients match

13:39.430 --> 13:40.200
what's supposed to be
in those products.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.670
How can that be?

13:41.870 --> 13:44.370
The list of "Stuff I Don't
Know" is getting longer.

13:44.570 --> 13:46.940
* *

13:47.140 --> 13:48.970
Coming down here to my job.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.840
Is this an intimidation tactic?

13:51.040 --> 13:53.050
No, it's a
fingerprint kit.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.010
Dinking a Wiffle ball.
That's your job?

13:55.210 --> 13:58.320
I'm an accredited
pickleball instructor.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.000
Ooh.
Accredited. Wow.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.820
Have you gone to visit
your sister-in-law

14:02.020 --> 14:03.020
Mimi since she woke up?

14:03.220 --> 14:04.260
We weren't close.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.260
Well, I guess

14:05.460 --> 14:06.690
you never will be.

14:06.890 --> 14:08.430
What with her accusing
you of murder and all.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.030
(laughs)

14:10.230 --> 14:11.300
Are you really gonna
believe someone

14:11.500 --> 14:13.250
who just took
a four-year nap?

14:13.980 --> 14:15.300
They said it was an accident.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.900
You know, she woke up
convinced that you came

14:17.100 --> 14:18.370
into the salon right
before they fell ill.

14:18.570 --> 14:20.410
(laughs)

14:20.610 --> 14:21.740
CHAVEZ:
How was your marriage?

14:21.940 --> 14:23.910
Mimi said you and
Sasha fought a lot.

14:24.110 --> 14:27.780
Our son William
was, uh, 19 then.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.020
I thought he deserved
to have some fun.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.650
Sasha wanted him to...
grow up.

14:32.850 --> 14:34.020
She made him work
at the salon.

14:34.220 --> 14:38.110
They were oil and water,
and... it spilled over.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.590
Do you have an alibi for
the night Sasha died?

14:41.790 --> 14:44.400
I was out for a drive. Alone.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.500
I remember being at exit 33

14:46.700 --> 14:47.930
when I got the call
from the hospital.

14:48.130 --> 14:49.700
I almost drove
off the road.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.000
What else?

14:51.200 --> 14:53.010
I'm in the middle of a lesson.

14:53.210 --> 14:55.060
Just the fingerprints for now.
We'll see you again later.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.290
Scoot.

14:58.730 --> 14:59.980
There you go.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.700
Ready?

15:04.630 --> 15:06.520
Really? Nothing?

15:06.720 --> 15:08.250
I just made a coin vanish

15:08.450 --> 15:09.520
and you're not even
a little impressed?

15:09.720 --> 15:11.040
What's that?

15:11.770 --> 15:13.660
PARK:
That...

15:13.860 --> 15:15.240
could actually
be useful.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.060
HANNAH:
It's a telephone.

15:17.260 --> 15:18.260
PARK (laughs):
It is a telephone.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.600
HANNAH:
Phone.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.830
I think we've got
a budding CSI here.

15:21.030 --> 15:22.700
Runs in the family.
Hey, Chris?

15:22.900 --> 15:24.270
Could you take Hannah outside

15:24.470 --> 15:26.910
and show her how
to bag the phone?
HANNAH: Yeah.

15:27.110 --> 15:28.410
We got to protect
the crime scene.

15:28.610 --> 15:29.740
Ooh.

15:29.940 --> 15:32.460
Doesn't that sound
fun? Come on.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.410
WILLOWS:
What do you have there?

15:34.610 --> 15:36.050
I don't know.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.820
Some kind of
black powder.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.180
I'll get Beau to test it.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.990
So, do you think
the killer's footprints

15:41.190 --> 15:42.490
will lead us to
some kind of proof?

15:42.690 --> 15:45.190
Hope so. I've already
identified 11 different sets

15:45.390 --> 15:47.590
of footprints but
several are the same size.

15:47.790 --> 15:49.330
Eleven?
Mm.

15:49.530 --> 15:50.700
Didn't Mimi say that
she mopped the floor

15:50.900 --> 15:51.960
at the end of the day?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.800
It may not be as
bad as it seems.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.420
We know one set
belongs to Sasha.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.820
Mimi's is the most common size.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.880
(laughing)

16:06.080 --> 16:07.710
Yeah, and we
already know about

16:07.910 --> 16:09.710
the two that belong
to the paramedics.

16:09.910 --> 16:11.820
Yep. Those will be
the patrol officer

16:12.020 --> 16:13.840
that turned up at the scene.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.660
That still leaves six.

16:17.860 --> 16:19.920
Six sets of footprints that
could belong to the killer.

16:20.130 --> 16:21.230
We got our
work cut out.

16:21.430 --> 16:23.860
But Folsom and
Chavez are helping,

16:24.060 --> 16:25.930
getting foot sizes
and gait analysis

16:26.130 --> 16:27.500
for everyone here that night.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.670
It was a Saturday, Saturdays
were usually very busy,

16:29.870 --> 16:31.240
so there were
a lot of us working.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.200
Oh! (chuckles)

16:32.400 --> 16:33.510
I'm ticklish.

16:33.710 --> 16:34.970
Sorry, we just need to get
an accurate foot size.

16:35.170 --> 16:37.940
That and gait analysis
will tell us who was where.

16:38.140 --> 16:39.380
CHAVEZ:
Gives us a range
of possible shoe prints,

16:39.580 --> 16:40.810
tells us who went near
the keratin treatment

16:41.010 --> 16:42.010
that was poisoned.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.350
Oh. Okay.

16:44.550 --> 16:45.720
I was restocking product

16:45.920 --> 16:47.000
at the front of the store.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.790
<i>We moved a lot of product.</i>
<i>Great margins at the salon.</i>

16:50.990 --> 16:52.460
I kept the books.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.630
Sasha and Mimi were really smart
about how they ran the place.

16:54.830 --> 16:55.660
Did anyone feel
like they deserved

16:55.860 --> 16:56.690
more than they were getting?

16:56.890 --> 16:57.660
I don't know if you've ever

16:57.860 --> 16:58.730
worked in a salon before,

16:58.930 --> 17:00.330
but there was a ton of drama.

17:00.530 --> 17:03.640
Do you remember any drama
involving Sasha and Mimi?

17:03.840 --> 17:07.670
No. I loved Sasha
and Mimi. Loved.

17:07.870 --> 17:09.770
Until they fired my ass.

17:09.970 --> 17:10.780
And...

17:10.980 --> 17:12.180
when was that, Nick?

17:12.380 --> 17:14.380
The day Sasha died.
Which sounds bad, I know.

17:14.580 --> 17:16.800
Yeah. It does.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.090
What were you doing
at the salon that night?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.420
Closing up my station.

17:21.620 --> 17:22.970
For good.

17:26.770 --> 17:28.630
FOLSOM:
Can you pick up your pace?
'Cause if we can't

17:28.830 --> 17:30.100
gauge how long
your stride is,

17:30.300 --> 17:31.830
it's hard to tell which
footprints were yours.

17:32.030 --> 17:34.300
Anyway, Sasha and
Mimi were sweet,

17:34.500 --> 17:35.600
but they didn't know
who to trust.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.770
I mean, the fact that

17:36.970 --> 17:38.400
they kept that
backstabbing--

17:38.600 --> 17:39.770
"...talentless diva."

17:39.970 --> 17:41.940
He called me that?
Mm-hmm.

17:42.140 --> 17:43.080
That's rich.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.680
Like, look in the
mirror, bro.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.110
You know, Nicky,

17:46.310 --> 17:47.610
would you say that
a lot of the salon's drama

17:47.810 --> 17:48.750
centered around you?

17:48.950 --> 17:51.450
I like it better
when she asks me

17:51.650 --> 17:52.930
the questions.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.760
CHAVEZ:
Uh...

17:57.960 --> 17:59.790
did you have any issues
with Sasha or Mimi?

17:59.990 --> 18:01.060
Never.

18:01.260 --> 18:02.390
Do you remember what
you were doing

18:02.590 --> 18:04.630
at the salon that night
after closing?

18:04.830 --> 18:06.580
Yeah. My hair.

18:10.050 --> 18:12.700
There was kind of an incident

18:12.900 --> 18:14.510
earlier that day when--

18:14.710 --> 18:16.540
I grabbed as much of Nicky's
hair as I could

18:16.740 --> 18:17.680
and I cut it off.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.110
Not proud of it,
(camera beeps)

18:19.310 --> 18:20.410
but it felt damn good.

18:20.610 --> 18:22.350
Back up.

18:22.550 --> 18:23.980
There was a Nick,

18:24.180 --> 18:25.850
a Nicky, and a Nicole working
at the salon at the same time?

18:26.050 --> 18:27.390
Two words:
scheduling nightmare.

18:27.590 --> 18:28.620
Looking back at it,

18:28.820 --> 18:29.850
I'm happy that I found out
that Nicky

18:30.050 --> 18:30.920
was sleeping with my boyfriend.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.990
I kicked him out,
got a dog,

18:33.190 --> 18:34.190
living happily ever after.

18:34.390 --> 18:36.340
But you weren't
so zen back then.

18:37.950 --> 18:38.800
Why'd you stay
so late at the salon?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.130
NICOLE:
Honestly?

18:40.330 --> 18:41.700
I wanted to watch that bitch
try to fix

18:41.900 --> 18:44.190
the hole in the back
of her head.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.310
(laughing)
Uh, can you please?

18:52.510 --> 18:54.610
How'd you find out
about the affair?

18:54.810 --> 18:56.310
Sasha
"accidentally" told me.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.420
I know you're not supposed
to shoot the messenger,

18:58.620 --> 18:59.680
but it left a bad taste.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.890
But the important thing is
I've grown.

19:02.090 --> 19:03.320
And the woman you see today
would never

19:03.520 --> 19:05.160
cut somebody's hair
without their consent.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.660
That's real progress.

19:06.860 --> 19:07.960
WILLIAM:
<i>100 days of being sober?</i>

19:08.160 --> 19:10.480
Yeah. I got my chip
and everything.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.960
Sure your mom
would've been proud.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.730
I think so.

19:14.930 --> 19:15.870
But she's also
the reason I drank

19:16.070 --> 19:17.800
in the first place.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.840
What'd you two
fight about?
Nothing.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.240
Everything.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.880
That day, it was about
being late to work.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.690
I didn't know it was gonna be
the last time I'd see her.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.950
If I did, I wouldn't
have been stomping around

19:28.150 --> 19:29.530
the front desk
like a little kid.

19:32.630 --> 19:36.070
<i>You know, I left without</i>
<i>saying goodbye to my mom.</i>

19:37.470 --> 19:38.520
Or "I love you."

19:38.720 --> 19:40.290
I'm kind of ashamed
to say it, but...

19:40.490 --> 19:43.580
I haven't seen Aunt Mimi
since she woke up.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.530
(shaky breath)

19:45.730 --> 19:47.520
It's just all too much.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.700
(camera beeps)
RAJAN: <i>And then there</i>

19:50.900 --> 19:52.470
was one, but no one's

19:52.670 --> 19:55.910
story or shoe size matches
this last set of prints.

19:56.110 --> 19:57.310
WILLOWS:
Which leads...

19:57.510 --> 19:59.540
nowhere.
You got anything?

19:59.740 --> 20:01.980
PARK:
Just fungal bloom for days,
on the walls,

20:02.180 --> 20:03.380
in the plants. (chuckles)

20:03.580 --> 20:05.970
Even fungus in
this anti-fungal Barbicide.

20:06.700 --> 20:10.050
How does fungus grow
in an anti-fungal solution?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.160
It was a sauna in here.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.230
You know how it goes.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.240
103 degrees
is when the magic happens.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.980
You know, you two
are on to something.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.700
It got hot in here.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.870
I think I know why
the killer was so sure

20:27.070 --> 20:30.810
that souped-up keratin
would be deadly.

20:31.010 --> 20:33.010
* *

20:33.210 --> 20:36.330
The footsteps to nowhere
end right here.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.020
Hmm.

20:43.220 --> 20:45.760
I don't think a rat did this.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.330
Unless it could handle a knife.

20:47.530 --> 20:49.790
WILLOWS:
System was serviced
a week before

20:49.990 --> 20:52.260
the sister died. It had
to have been working then.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.130
So the first casualty that night

20:54.330 --> 20:55.870
was the ventilation system.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.740
WILLOWS:
<i>The killer made sure</i>
<i>the keratin treatment</i>

20:57.940 --> 20:59.700
<i>was more potent than ever.</i>

20:59.900 --> 21:02.410
<i>And there was nowhere</i>
<i>for the fumes to go but</i>

21:02.610 --> 21:04.980
<i>into the sisters' lungs.</i>
(coughing)

21:05.180 --> 21:06.610
Pretty ingenious.

21:06.810 --> 21:09.060
And pretty damn evil.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.790
* *

21:16.990 --> 21:19.590
If this really is
the killer's footprint,

21:19.790 --> 21:21.330
he's no giant. This is like a...

21:21.530 --> 21:23.260
men's size 9 running shoe.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.900
Or a woman's size 10 and half.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.370
Sasha's son William
is too big.

21:27.570 --> 21:28.830
Nicky and Nicole are too small.

21:29.030 --> 21:32.170
That Leaves us with Sasha's
husband Ken,

21:32.370 --> 21:33.540
her best friend Heather,

21:33.740 --> 21:36.870
and Nick,
the employee they fired.

21:37.070 --> 21:39.010
Only one of them was ID'd
by the victim.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.780
Ken for sure is
suspect number one.

21:41.980 --> 21:45.450
Did I hear right,
his thing is pickleball?

21:45.650 --> 21:47.050
I happen to love pickle ball.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.690
It's not as fun as badminton,
but it's easier

21:48.890 --> 21:50.020
to find a game in this country.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.040
I thought it was more
like ping-pong.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.390
Chris, can
you at least

21:54.590 --> 21:55.930
pretend to be useful?

21:56.130 --> 21:58.350
Track the
killer's footsteps.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.220
Oh. Oh.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.990
* *

22:15.160 --> 22:16.950
Hey, you know the, uh,
black powder

22:17.150 --> 22:18.550
you found earlier?
Mm.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.590
It's all along
the killer's route.

22:20.790 --> 22:23.240
I'm thinking maybe
they left it.

22:23.740 --> 22:25.320
We, uh, should test it.
RAJAN: Yeah.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.420
Along with this.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.230
What?

22:28.430 --> 22:29.910
Have a look for yourself.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.780
Oh, wow.

22:35.950 --> 22:37.900
It's the only fungal
bloom in the vent.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.570
I doubt much organic
material was in here

22:39.770 --> 22:41.140
when the system was
up and running.

22:41.340 --> 22:42.840
Maybe this sprouted from

22:43.040 --> 22:45.440
something the killer left
when they cut the air.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.040
A girl can dream.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.400
(Rajan chuckles)

22:49.530 --> 22:51.970
* *

22:57.300 --> 22:58.520
RAJAN:
I mean...

22:58.720 --> 23:02.060
you have to agree that
is a beautiful thing.

23:02.260 --> 23:05.100
It's a single follicle of hair
in-in a dirty salon.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.430
I mean, couldn't it belong to,
you know, anyone?

23:07.630 --> 23:08.700
It was in an
industrial-grade

23:08.900 --> 23:09.800
ventilation system.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.340
(whooshing)

23:11.540 --> 23:13.610
<i>I think it would've</i>
<i>been sucked out unless</i>

23:13.810 --> 23:14.740
<i>the killer left it there</i>

23:14.940 --> 23:16.110
<i>when they disabled the system.</i>

23:16.310 --> 23:17.290
(grunting)

23:17.930 --> 23:19.810
In that case,
you're right.

23:20.010 --> 23:22.210
It's so beautiful,
I want a closer look.
(chuckles)

23:22.410 --> 23:23.400
FOLSOM:
Hey.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.650
You know your
mystery black powder?

23:26.850 --> 23:27.790
Uh-huh.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.850
It's charcoal.
Oh.

23:30.050 --> 23:31.590
That's not so much
a mystery after all.

23:31.790 --> 23:33.090
It's not?

23:33.290 --> 23:35.690
No. It's probably all
hype, but tons of shampoos

23:35.890 --> 23:38.060
advertise that
they contain charcoal.

23:38.260 --> 23:40.300
Removes residue, adds
volume, that sort of thing.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.300
It is strange that we'd
find tiny chunks though,

23:42.500 --> 23:45.470
although some vegan products
do add in raw ingredients

23:45.670 --> 23:46.950
instead of synthesizing...

23:47.520 --> 23:49.210
Aw.

23:49.410 --> 23:50.540
You're in over your
head, aren't you?
FINADO: Whoa. Look at this.

23:50.740 --> 23:52.510
Hey, we've got
finasteride.

23:52.710 --> 23:53.650
Hair loss medication.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.110
You take it to
block the formation

23:55.310 --> 23:56.880
of dihydrotestosterone,
which leads to hair loss.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.680
It looks like broken glass
underneath the 'scope.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.520
FOLSOM: That was on
the hair you found?
FINADO: Mm-hmm.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.240
So our killer's
going bald.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.190
Ken has been balding
ever since I've known him.

24:07.390 --> 24:08.460
See?

24:08.660 --> 24:10.190
Oh, no, I believe you,
Mimi. It's just that

24:10.390 --> 24:13.100
we didn't get any
usable DNA on the hair.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.800
And hair loss medication
just isn't enough.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.470
So... there's nothing
you can do?

24:17.670 --> 24:20.400
No, we're not giving up.
We're still looking at Ken,

24:20.610 --> 24:22.340
but we're also looking
at everyone who--

24:22.540 --> 24:23.680
You don't need to.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.530
It was Ken.

24:27.730 --> 24:32.620
It's not uncommon for coma
patients to recover slowly.

24:32.820 --> 24:35.490
For memories to
reemerge in time.

24:35.690 --> 24:38.460
I told you what I think
happened that night.

24:38.660 --> 24:40.940
But can you be more specific?

24:45.650 --> 24:47.450
I...

24:48.220 --> 24:50.070
I remember the
treatment smelled...

24:50.270 --> 24:52.040
<i>different, more intense.</i>

24:52.240 --> 24:53.570
Yeah, that would make sense.

24:53.770 --> 24:57.340
Someone doctored the treatment
with added formaldehyde.

24:57.540 --> 24:59.410
What else?

24:59.610 --> 25:01.650
I remember...

25:01.850 --> 25:03.010
the music, it-it got loud.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.380
* I will survive *

25:04.580 --> 25:07.120
<i>N-not at first,</i>

25:07.320 --> 25:08.320
<i>but then it got loud.</i>
* Hey hey... *

25:08.520 --> 25:09.850
That tracks, too.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.190
When the ventilation
system went off,

25:11.390 --> 25:13.420
the music probably
did sound louder.

25:13.630 --> 25:14.980
Right.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.870
That's all I can remember.

25:22.070 --> 25:23.700
Except for just this...

25:23.900 --> 25:26.740
sense that it was Ken.

25:26.940 --> 25:29.310
He and Sasha
had been fighting,

25:29.510 --> 25:32.140
about William, about Ken
spending too much money.

25:32.340 --> 25:35.830
Mimi, did you see
Ken that night?

25:36.600 --> 25:37.830
(gasping)

25:39.770 --> 25:40.790
It's complicated.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.550
Kind of.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.320
I know Ken was there.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.660
I just... can't remember
seeing his face.

25:48.860 --> 25:50.730
I remember...

25:50.930 --> 25:53.110
a-a haze of grey.

25:53.410 --> 25:54.270
<i>And a snout.</i>

25:54.470 --> 25:55.530
Like a monster.

25:55.730 --> 25:57.970
I know it sounds crazy.

25:58.170 --> 26:01.370
A grey face and a snout.

26:01.570 --> 26:02.270
Yeah.

26:02.470 --> 26:03.810
And then the monster...

26:04.010 --> 26:07.810
crouched down low,
like it was gonna...

26:08.010 --> 26:09.300
jump out at us.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.020
Mimi, could you be
describing a dream?

26:13.220 --> 26:16.140
I'm telling you,
it wasn't a dream.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.380
(rummaging)

26:27.450 --> 26:30.200
Hey.
So, I spoke
with Mimi again

26:30.400 --> 26:32.170
and, honestly, her
testimony's gonna be worthless.

26:32.370 --> 26:33.570
What are you looking for?

26:33.770 --> 26:34.710
Nothing.

26:34.910 --> 26:37.460
Hmm. Doesn't
look like nothing.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.250
Okay, I'm
looking for a cord

26:41.450 --> 26:42.610
to fit that phone
that we found.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.420
Don't we have a whole lab
for things like that?

26:44.620 --> 26:47.170
Yeah, but, you know,
they get, you know.

26:53.540 --> 26:54.990
WILLOWS:
Oh, Max.

26:55.190 --> 26:58.030
You're an undercover mess.

26:58.230 --> 26:59.830
Do not tell a soul.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.380
Our secret.

27:03.220 --> 27:07.000
So, Take Your Granddaughter
to Work Day, hmm?

27:07.200 --> 27:08.810
How'd Linds
handle that?

27:09.010 --> 27:10.370
Handle what?

27:10.570 --> 27:11.940
The fact that you took her
daughter to a crime scene.

27:12.140 --> 27:14.110
It was a <i>stale</i> crime scene.

27:14.310 --> 27:15.480
As you know.
Mm-hmm.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.110
And I didn't tell her.
It's just easier that way.

27:17.310 --> 27:18.750
So you think
that a toddler

27:18.950 --> 27:21.790
is not gonna tell her mama
that her grandmama took her

27:21.990 --> 27:23.550
to an old creepy
hair salon

27:23.760 --> 27:26.890
with no lights on
and dust all over the place?

27:27.090 --> 27:28.960
Uh, maybe not,
I hope not.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.030
That's my
special stuff.

27:31.230 --> 27:35.220
I'm just always skating on
such thin ice with Lindsey.

27:36.380 --> 27:37.600
Okay, I don't
mean to overstep,

27:37.800 --> 27:39.400
especially since I am
the one to call you in

27:39.600 --> 27:41.840
on your day off...
Well, I'm the one
who took the case.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.010
...but what's it gonna take

27:43.210 --> 27:44.540
to make things right
between you two?

27:44.740 --> 27:46.730
(gasps) I found it.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.810
Suit up.

27:49.010 --> 27:50.180
Time for work.

27:50.380 --> 27:51.720
WILLOWS:
This is Sasha's phone.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.080
PARK:
Last call made
was 6:08 that night,

27:53.280 --> 27:56.050
but... check these timestamps.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.050
ROBY:
Wow.

27:57.250 --> 27:59.110
Final moments here.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.510
Wait. Go back.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.530
What is that
in the background,

28:04.730 --> 28:05.710
on the wall?

28:07.010 --> 28:08.400
Is that a person?

28:08.600 --> 28:10.100
ROBY:
It's got to be.
Someone was in the salon

28:10.300 --> 28:12.400
with them, or something.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.810
"A monster."

28:14.010 --> 28:14.810
And damned if it

28:15.010 --> 28:16.110
doesn't have a snout.

28:16.310 --> 28:17.760
Maybe Mimi wasn't dreaming.

28:18.660 --> 28:22.600
No. Maybe she was living
a nightmare.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.790
* *

28:30.990 --> 28:34.090
So, there's the source
of Mimi's coma dream, huh?

28:34.290 --> 28:35.230
Mm-hmm.

28:35.430 --> 28:36.760
It looks like
between this photo,

28:36.960 --> 28:39.260
the finasteride that
we found on the hair

28:39.460 --> 28:40.730
that was in the vent,

28:40.930 --> 28:42.130
and the killer's shoe size...

28:42.330 --> 28:45.740
Everything that Mimi told me
about that night,

28:45.940 --> 28:49.310
about Ken, it's all adding up.

28:49.510 --> 28:50.740
Mm-hmm.
But still...

28:50.940 --> 28:52.180
If I'm Ken's attorney,

28:52.380 --> 28:54.080
I'm probably not too worried
about casting doubt

28:54.280 --> 28:55.050
on Mimi's recollection.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.110
Well, sure, I mean, she was

28:57.310 --> 28:59.650
drugged, traumatized...

28:59.850 --> 29:01.990
And most witnesses
aren't popping out

29:02.190 --> 29:03.250
of a four-year coma.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.960
Eyewitness testimony
and-and physical evidence

29:06.160 --> 29:08.590
don't always line up under
the best of circumstances.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.190
Half the time I
reconstruct a crime scene,

29:10.390 --> 29:12.560
I find serious
discrepancies.
Mm-hmm.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.170
Just means that
if Ken is really...

29:16.370 --> 29:18.240
the monster, we just
have to prove it.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.500
I can go back to the salon,
take a look at the space

29:20.700 --> 29:21.670
with fresh eyes,
and try to explain

29:21.870 --> 29:23.170
this shape here.

29:23.370 --> 29:24.810
Forensic shadow puppets?

29:25.010 --> 29:28.080
I'll let you know if we're up
against a wolf or a bunny.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.310
(chuckling)

29:29.510 --> 29:30.880
So...
Hmm?

29:31.080 --> 29:32.350
What do you think she means

29:32.550 --> 29:36.750
when Mimi says she
remembers Ken as a monster?

29:36.950 --> 29:37.550
Okay.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.560
Even a healthy brain

29:39.760 --> 29:42.430
is-is an imperfect
storage for memory.

29:42.630 --> 29:45.900
<i>Our synapses, they-they fire</i>
<i>and they rewire together.</i>

29:46.100 --> 29:48.200
<i>And there are neuroscientists</i>
<i>who say</i>

29:48.400 --> 29:50.570
<i>that it is impossible for</i>
<i>someone to have a memory</i>

29:50.770 --> 29:52.670
<i>without altering it in some way.</i>

29:52.870 --> 29:54.240
(chuckles)

29:54.440 --> 29:55.670
What?

29:55.870 --> 29:59.510
That, my friend,
is Lindsey

29:59.710 --> 30:02.380
and my problem
in a nutshell.

30:02.580 --> 30:05.350
I mean, what that girl
remembers from her childhood

30:05.550 --> 30:08.950
is so wildly different
than what I experienced.

30:09.150 --> 30:12.260
What you think
you experienced.

30:12.460 --> 30:13.520
Okay.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.530
But I do think
that Lindsey is...

30:16.730 --> 30:18.260
a little prone
to embellishment.

30:18.460 --> 30:20.600
Maybe Mimi is, too.

30:20.800 --> 30:23.000
ROBY:
A snout-nosed monster.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.670
I mean, it's a
better story, right?
Sure.

30:25.870 --> 30:28.640
But it might not
be intentional.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.440
For either of them.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.780
Yep.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.410
I'll be in my office
if you need anything.

30:34.610 --> 30:36.480
Oh, hey, Max?
Yeah.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.880
Uh, do you have 200 or 300
rubber bands I can borrow?

30:40.080 --> 30:42.090
(both laughing)
(phone chiming)

30:42.290 --> 30:43.700
Is that a yes?

30:45.740 --> 30:47.140
Oh.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.080
Oh, Linds.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.150
(sighs)
(phone ringing)

30:59.950 --> 31:01.440
This is Catherine.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.970
Hey, it's Chavez.

31:03.170 --> 31:04.780
So, Ken Taylor agreed
to come in for questioning.

31:04.980 --> 31:07.110
I thought you might want
to join.

31:07.310 --> 31:08.950
I'm on my way.

31:09.150 --> 31:12.350
How exactly is my hair, or
lack of it, relevant here?

31:12.550 --> 31:13.620
We found a hair in the salon--

31:13.820 --> 31:15.650
A hair in the hair salon?

31:15.850 --> 31:17.350
Nice work, Detective.

31:17.550 --> 31:18.660
In the ventilation system

31:18.860 --> 31:20.360
next to a wire
that had been cut.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.230
Which is how
the killer knew

31:22.430 --> 31:23.930
that Sasha and Mimi
would die from the fumes.

31:24.130 --> 31:26.100
That... That's why Sasha died?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.930
Yes, we performed
a chemical analysis

31:29.130 --> 31:31.540
on the hair and
found finasteride.

31:31.740 --> 31:34.170
Have you ever used
finasteride, Ken?

31:34.370 --> 31:36.540
Yeah, I have. I did.
In the past.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.840
When I was starting to
lose my hair in the '90s.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.550
It didn't work well, obviously.

31:41.750 --> 31:43.080
(chuckles)

31:43.280 --> 31:45.750
So, you gave up in your 20s?

31:45.950 --> 31:48.020
Just accepted your fate
from the Hair Gods?

31:48.220 --> 31:49.550
Never picked up
finasteride again?

31:49.750 --> 31:53.390
Ladies, believe me, I would kill
for a thick mane of hair.

31:53.590 --> 31:54.730
Would you now?

31:54.930 --> 31:56.890
Bad choice of words.

31:57.090 --> 31:58.930
But finasteride
wasn't just a bust.

31:59.130 --> 32:01.230
I'm allergic to it. Severely.

32:01.430 --> 32:02.900
If you want
my medical records,

32:03.100 --> 32:05.050
you can see for yourself.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.110
So? Is that it?

32:09.310 --> 32:11.440
We're gonna need
to see those records.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.750
Fine. But I didn't kill my wife.

32:14.950 --> 32:17.130
No matter what
my sister-in-law says.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.940
* *

32:24.170 --> 32:26.060
Rarr.
(Folsom laughing)

32:26.260 --> 32:27.820
(laughing) How is this?

32:28.030 --> 32:29.960
FOLSOM:
The size is right.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.560
And the angle, too.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.460
So that's got to be about where
the monster was standing,

32:33.660 --> 32:35.400
but the snout is all wrong.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.420
Let's have a look.

32:39.690 --> 32:41.940
It really
doesn't seem human.

32:42.140 --> 32:44.240
Well... whatever it
is had to be moving

32:44.440 --> 32:46.940
because the shadow isn't
in all of the pictures.

32:47.140 --> 32:49.010
Maybe a person behind
a piece of equipment?

32:49.210 --> 32:51.680
Hmm. Whatever it was,
it's not there now.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.850
If we find it, could be
something the killer handled.

32:54.050 --> 32:55.190
FOLSOM:
Yeah, I mean...

32:55.390 --> 32:56.620
Explore the salon.
Knock yourself out.

32:56.820 --> 33:00.170
I'll... I'll
judge from here.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.280
Or I could help.

33:05.710 --> 33:06.700
I got it.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.980
* *

33:21.030 --> 33:24.900
Okay, well,
that was a bust.

33:25.500 --> 33:28.420
Yeah, whose terrible
idea was that?
(sighs)

33:28.620 --> 33:29.950
What are you, giving up?

33:30.150 --> 33:32.020
No. Mimi said the monster

33:32.220 --> 33:35.260
crouched down as if it was
ready to spring at them.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.790
But there's a
wall here.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.430
Maybe it got closer.

33:39.630 --> 33:40.600
That's where
Mimi lay,

33:40.800 --> 33:42.270
with her head to the side.

33:42.470 --> 33:43.730
Do you see there?

33:43.930 --> 33:45.450
Yeah.

33:49.590 --> 33:50.440
Hey.

33:50.640 --> 33:51.940
Check that out.

33:52.140 --> 33:53.740
It's almost like...

33:53.940 --> 33:55.610
Say it.

33:55.810 --> 33:57.150
Talons.
(chuckles)

33:57.350 --> 33:58.850
Okay, I don't
believe this.

33:59.050 --> 34:01.790
Everything in this case seems
to be leading to some sort of

34:01.990 --> 34:03.890
murderous,
fantastical creature.

34:04.090 --> 34:06.590
With a snout.
(sighs)

34:06.790 --> 34:10.560
Fine. If you can't beat
them, join them, right?

34:10.760 --> 34:13.100
Let's see if this creature
left any droppings.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.430
(chuckles)
Magical scat.

34:15.630 --> 34:17.380
(vacuum whirring)

34:22.490 --> 34:24.530
* *

34:39.810 --> 34:41.530
Hey.

34:41.730 --> 34:43.560
Is it possible that
this fancy pants salon

34:43.760 --> 34:45.000
was selling knock-off products?

34:45.200 --> 34:46.600
FINADO:
<i>100%.</i>

34:46.800 --> 34:48.500
Y-you remember when we couldn't
figure out how the ingredients

34:48.700 --> 34:50.030
in the shampoo and conditioner
didn't match the ingredients

34:50.230 --> 34:52.040
in the bottles? Never mind.
Of course you do.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.840
But it wasn't because
someone added something

34:54.040 --> 34:55.610
like they did with
the-the Panamanian Perm,

34:55.810 --> 34:56.710
noun, not a verb.

34:56.910 --> 34:57.910
But the shampoo
and conditioner,

34:58.110 --> 34:59.080
it was because the
original ingredients

34:59.280 --> 35:01.300
were never there
in the first place.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.780
Now, after we tested
each component

35:03.980 --> 35:05.080
of what we did find
in the bottles,

35:05.280 --> 35:06.650
I can officially confirm:

35:06.850 --> 35:09.090
that-that it's barely
bargain bin drugstore quality.

35:09.290 --> 35:11.220
I-I don't know if it
would qualify as soap.

35:11.420 --> 35:12.590
(chuckles)
So, what is in there?

35:12.790 --> 35:16.030
Oh, just a cocktail of
your cheapest fragrances

35:16.230 --> 35:17.290
and chemicals available.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.460
Anionic surfactants,
parabens,

35:19.660 --> 35:20.530
polyethylene glycol,

35:20.730 --> 35:22.400
all being sold
at $38 a pop.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.200
That is a crime
in and of itself.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.620
But is it motive for murder?

35:27.920 --> 35:29.810
(sighs)

35:30.010 --> 35:31.010
Always with
the last word.

35:31.210 --> 35:32.510
Just... always.

35:32.710 --> 35:34.090
Always?

35:36.230 --> 35:37.900
Always.
Always.

35:38.570 --> 35:41.020
Can't really hear
through the glass.

35:41.220 --> 35:43.100
Can't hear you.

35:53.750 --> 35:54.600
Wait a minute.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.200
Here we go.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.920
Bag three. Where's this from?

35:58.950 --> 36:02.520
RAJAN:
Here. Right next to the
talon markings we found.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.330
Do you know
what this is?

36:06.160 --> 36:07.240
A bit of plastic?

36:07.440 --> 36:09.180
It's a very special
hunk of plastic.

36:09.380 --> 36:10.450
See the tessellation?

36:10.650 --> 36:13.780
It wasn't a monster
in that photograph.

36:13.980 --> 36:16.340
It was a person
wearing a gas mask.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.310
(typing)

36:21.010 --> 36:21.960
The mouthpiece.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.830
Tessellated plastic.

36:24.030 --> 36:25.300
There is your snout.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.900
And what kept the killer
alive in a toxic environment.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.230
So that's one small
mystery solved.

36:30.430 --> 36:34.270
Actually... I think this
tiny piece of plastic

36:34.470 --> 36:37.320
might just help us
solve the whole case.

36:42.430 --> 36:45.680
Hey. Somebody's
having a good day, huh?
I sure am.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.520
I can now
definitely report:

36:47.720 --> 36:49.020
there is not a violent,
fantastical beast

36:49.220 --> 36:50.720
roaming the streets
of Las Vegas.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.290
Yay, what a relief.

36:52.490 --> 36:53.790
Mimi didn't see a monster
the night her sister died.

36:53.990 --> 36:56.660
She saw someone
wearing a gas mask.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.260
<i>And she didn't see</i>
<i>a monster crouch down,</i>

36:58.460 --> 37:00.900
<i>she saw a masked poisoner</i>
<i>fall down.</i>

37:01.100 --> 37:02.270
<i>It's hard to see in those masks.</i>

37:02.470 --> 37:03.900
<i>They probably tripped.</i>

37:04.100 --> 37:06.770
<i>The killer's gas mask</i>
<i>must've broken on impact,</i>

37:06.970 --> 37:08.710
<i>that's why remnants</i>
<i>of its charcoal filter</i>

37:08.910 --> 37:10.210
<i>were scattered on the floor.</i>

37:10.410 --> 37:12.110
So the bits of charcoal
you found on the floor,

37:12.310 --> 37:13.940
weren't from a hair product.
Mm-mm.

37:14.140 --> 37:15.810
I mean, there was a mystery,
just not the mystery we thought.

37:16.010 --> 37:18.330
What about the talon
markings in the dust?

37:18.830 --> 37:20.300
Plain old forearms and pinkies.

37:21.700 --> 37:23.390
Yeah, that one's
a little embarrassing.

37:23.590 --> 37:24.860
Hey. I blame Folsom.

37:25.060 --> 37:25.820
And?

37:26.020 --> 37:27.620
What, that's not enough?
No.

37:27.820 --> 37:28.930
Are you not satisfied?
No.

37:29.130 --> 37:30.960
Who was wearing
that damn gas mask?

37:31.160 --> 37:32.850
RAJAN:
<i>Oh, we're going to find out.</i>

37:33.510 --> 37:35.620
* *

37:37.650 --> 37:39.170
Hey. What do you got?

37:39.370 --> 37:42.270
Nothing yet. You're about
two minutes too early.
All right.

37:42.470 --> 37:43.270
Hey.
Hey.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.480
What's up?

37:44.680 --> 37:47.940
Oh, Lindsey's furious
with me. Again.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.180
It'll be fine.

37:49.380 --> 37:50.210
Sorry about that.

37:50.410 --> 37:51.650
Yeah, we both
saw it coming.

37:51.850 --> 37:55.690
Listen, when this case is over,

37:55.890 --> 37:57.590
I'd like to take some time.

37:57.790 --> 38:00.820
To really be there
for Lindsey and Hannah.

38:01.020 --> 38:02.860
If they'll have me.
I don't know

38:03.060 --> 38:05.360
if the timing is right.
Catherine.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.500
You built this Lab.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.750
You do whatever
the hell you want.

38:12.220 --> 38:13.320
Thank you, Max.

38:13.990 --> 38:16.470
I'll tell you what.
What?

38:16.670 --> 38:18.170
I think your killer
had minty fresh breath.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.480
Picking up something in
that charcoal filter.

38:20.680 --> 38:22.580
It-it's synthetic
flavoring for spearmint.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.150
There's traces of mint?

38:24.350 --> 38:26.150
You know what else we'll
find in that charcoal?

38:26.350 --> 38:28.030
The killer's DNA.

38:29.770 --> 38:30.620
Mint?

38:30.820 --> 38:33.260
No, I'm... I'm good.

38:33.460 --> 38:34.980
Well, not for long.

38:36.710 --> 38:39.560
It was a tiny mint
like this

38:39.760 --> 38:41.680
that got you
in trouble, Heather.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.470
Excuse me?

38:43.670 --> 38:44.570
ROBY:
There were traces

38:44.770 --> 38:46.000
of a synthetic spearmint

38:46.200 --> 38:48.000
on the charcoal
that we found at the salon.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.370
WILLOWS:
<i>We knew that the charcoal</i>
<i>came from the filter</i>

38:50.570 --> 38:52.510
<i>in a gas mask the killer wore,</i>

38:52.710 --> 38:55.880
<i>breathed through, so, we</i>
<i>thought we'd run some tests.</i>

38:56.080 --> 38:59.680
Did you really think
that your DNA would...

38:59.880 --> 39:01.640
fade or something?

39:02.640 --> 39:03.890
This is... I don't understand.

39:04.090 --> 39:05.420
It seems like I should
be asking for a lawyer.

39:05.620 --> 39:06.460
ROBY:
Oh, you'll get one.

39:06.660 --> 39:07.760
But you don't need a lawyer

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
to hear that your hair
looks good.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.660
Yeah, her hair looks
good, doesn't it?

39:10.860 --> 39:11.660
It looks good.

39:11.860 --> 39:13.230
That finasteride

39:13.430 --> 39:14.400
works wonders.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.470
ROBY:
Right?
How did you... know?

39:16.670 --> 39:18.690
We found this photo of you.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.370
WILLOWS:
And one of your hairs

39:21.570 --> 39:23.670
in the vent, right next
to the wire you cut.

39:23.870 --> 39:25.380
ROBY:
And we not only
figured out how

39:25.580 --> 39:28.450
you killed Sasha and put your
best friend Mimi in a coma,

39:28.650 --> 39:30.150
we figured out why.

39:30.350 --> 39:31.950
You kept the books
for the salon.

39:32.150 --> 39:34.330
<i>You stocked the supplies,</i>
<i>you bought the products.</i>

39:35.470 --> 39:38.790
ROBY:
<i>You were buying knock-off</i>
<i>shampoo and conditioner,</i>

39:38.990 --> 39:40.590
<i>selling it as the real thing,</i>

39:40.790 --> 39:42.390
<i>and pocketing the difference.</i>

39:42.590 --> 39:44.530
WILLOWS:
How long were you at it
before Sasha found out?

39:44.730 --> 39:45.700
Was she gonna press charges?

39:45.900 --> 39:47.260
Oh, it's really
a moot point.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.330
'cause she didn't give
her a chance, 'cause you knew

39:50.530 --> 39:52.540
that Mimi was giving Sasha

39:52.740 --> 39:54.760
a keratin treatment
that night.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.610
<i>You were an expert</i>
<i>on the products</i>

39:57.810 --> 40:00.080
<i>so you doctored the bottle.</i>

40:00.280 --> 40:04.550
WILLOWS:
<i>And snuck back in</i>
<i>to kill the HVAC system.</i>

40:04.750 --> 40:05.980
<i>And your bosses.</i>

40:06.180 --> 40:07.650
ROBY:
<i>But Mimi...</i>

40:07.850 --> 40:11.910
<i>she is a fighter.</i>

40:12.610 --> 40:13.860
Yes, she is.

40:14.060 --> 40:15.690
Doctors always said
she might wake up someday.

40:15.890 --> 40:16.930
WILLOWS:
Right?

40:17.130 --> 40:18.630
So you had to be thorough.

40:18.830 --> 40:21.160
Just in case she ever
did come out of it,

40:21.360 --> 40:22.750
she wouldn't be able to ID you.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.940
ROBY:
<i>You weren't just reading</i>
<i>to her, were you?</i>

40:25.140 --> 40:26.440
<i>You were telling her a story.</i>

40:26.640 --> 40:31.740
Ken killed your sister.
Ken killed your sister.

40:31.940 --> 40:35.350
WILLOWS:
"Ken killed your sister."

40:35.550 --> 40:37.360
Almost worked.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.200
No. Mimi will defend me. Watch.

40:41.970 --> 40:44.760
She will always
believe it was Ken.

40:44.960 --> 40:46.520
WILLOWS:
Have a little faith
in people, Heather.

40:46.720 --> 40:48.460
They usually see the truth

40:48.660 --> 40:51.760
when you show them
what they need to see.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.150
("Don't Dream It's Over"
playing)

41:03.390 --> 41:05.010
Hey.

41:05.210 --> 41:06.140
Will.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.610
I'm so sorry about
your mom, honey.

41:08.810 --> 41:11.410
* Now I'm walking again *

41:11.620 --> 41:13.850
* To the beat of a drum *

41:14.050 --> 41:18.490
* And I'm counting the steps
to the door of your heart *

41:18.690 --> 41:21.090
* *

41:21.290 --> 41:24.230
* Only shadows ahead *

41:24.430 --> 41:26.300
* Barely clearing the roof *

41:26.500 --> 41:32.940
* Get to know the feeling
of liberation and release *

41:33.140 --> 41:35.570
* Hey now, hey now *

41:35.770 --> 41:39.110
* Don't dream it's over *

41:39.310 --> 41:41.780
* Hey now, hey now *

41:41.980 --> 41:45.080
* When the world comes in *

41:45.280 --> 41:47.920
* They come, they come *

41:48.120 --> 41:51.720
* To build a wall between us *

41:51.920 --> 41:55.060
* We know they won't win *

41:55.260 --> 41:56.630
* Oh, no, no *

41:56.830 --> 41:58.460
* <i>Hey now, hey now</i> *

41:58.660 --> 42:00.480
* Oh, no, no *

42:01.480 --> 42:02.830
(phone whooshes)

42:03.030 --> 42:04.970
* Hey now, hey now *

42:05.170 --> 42:07.350
(Willows chuckles)

42:09.160 --> 42:12.890
* Hey now, hey now. *
