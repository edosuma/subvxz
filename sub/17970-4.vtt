01:09.528 --> 01:11.195
Travis?

01:13.365 --> 01:16.534
I missed you at breakfast this morning.
Are you okay?

01:16.744 --> 01:20.496
You liked it, didn't you?
Being with him. You're all the same.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.459
We talked about this.
You said that you understood.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.757
It doesn't change anything.
I am a vessel for another's path.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.760
The life growing inside of me
belongs to all of us.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.810
Travis.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.938
He can't have you.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.857
He can't have you!

01:48.025 --> 01:50.318
He can't have you.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.336
-Did you sleep well?
-Sleep? No.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.213
What's wrong?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.675
What the hell have you done
to Daniel and Jaye?

02:55.884 --> 02:58.344
It can be difficult
being back home with family.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.346
"Family"?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.225
Daniel stomps around the cabin
like a grizzly bear.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.438
You do realize
they're not actually here?

03:10.065 --> 03:13.401
They are on a morning hike.
They will come back soon.

03:17.364 --> 03:22.743
We have the whole day to enjoy
some quality father-daughter time.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.458
Alan.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.920
Alan, wake up. Come on.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.631
Hey, there you are.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.717
Hey, stay with me now.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.052
-What happened?
-I don't know.

03:40.262 --> 03:42.972
I found you lying here
a few minutes ago.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.225
Looks like you took a good shot
in the back of the head.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.563
-Who'd you piss off this time?
-It's personal.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.149
Easy, easy, easy.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.985
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not fine.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.529
You need medical attention.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.158
And as much as I'd like to,
I'm not gonna just leave you here.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.410
Come on.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.455
Come on.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.172
Oh, man.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.593
It's open.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.972
-Morning, Kyle. How are you feeling?
-What do you want?

04:25.140 --> 04:29.352
Well, I heard what happened. I wanted
to apologize on behalf of my children.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.187
Your children?

04:32.230 --> 04:33.606
Figure of speech.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.901
They don't belong to any one family.
They're of the community.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.779
What I do find tragic is...

04:40.572 --> 04:43.866
...how this terrible disease
could've altered their behavior like that.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.369
We both know that wasn't the case.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.413
-I'm not following you.
-Let me spell it out.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.249
Those kids had no rash, no jaundice...

04:52.459 --> 04:55.211
...no physical signs
of the pathogen whatsoever.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.254
And none of them
remembers a damn thing.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.050
I saw a boy attacking his own mother.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.302
What else could explain
such violent behavior?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.513
They were under the influence
of something...

05:05.681 --> 05:07.390
...but not the pathogen.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.976
For my money...

05:10.477 --> 05:12.520
...you brainwashed those poor kids.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.981
Brainwashed?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.817
You've been reading
too many spy novels.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.527
I know what I saw.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.239
You may have others fooled,
but I know what you are.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.116
Oh, really?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.868
What am I?

05:35.127 --> 05:37.753
The samples are ready.
It's time to get back to work.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.808
Dr. Jordan.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.352
I know it's not possible...

05:53.520 --> 05:56.480
...but you just seem so familiar to me.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.065
Have we met?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.985
No.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.611
No, I'd remember.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.662
Hey.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.416
-What was that all about?
-I heard a knock, and there he was.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.418
Must've been following
that path of his.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.047
I'm fine, by the way. Nearly stoned
to death. Thanks for asking.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.798
Look, we don't have a treatment.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.593
If we can't reach full containment,
there's no stopping this.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.596
-You saw what happened on that ship.
-What do we do?

06:28.805 --> 06:32.683
The pathogen's on both sides of the gate.
It's not like the locals are helping any.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.061
It's their fear of outsiders.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.688
-So, what are we looking for?
-A fungal toxin.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.400
One that's ingested rather than inhaled.
It's likely in the food supply.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.986
-But none of the food has tested positive.
-Not yet.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.448
-Testing everything is gonna take weeks.
-Yeah, we don't have weeks.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.534
-But we do have a survivor.
-Soren.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.538
He's the only one who's had a recovery.
His immunity may be the key here.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.373
-Any idea where he's at?
-No.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.503
But the fact that he's missing
and no one's looking very hard for him...

07:00.712 --> 07:04.006
...makes me think that somebody
doesn't want us to find him.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.849
-What's going on?
-Have you seen this?

07:17.521 --> 07:20.439
Oh, no. It's Travis.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.609
-Look.
-Oh, no.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.611
It's terrible.

07:26.530 --> 07:31.075
-How do you want to handle this?
-Infirmary. Prep him for an autopsy.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.369
He was fine yesterday.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.415
Olivia.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.251
Olivia.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.295
Olivia, hi. I'm Dr. Jordan.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.173
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

07:47.050 --> 07:49.051
It's very important
that we find your son.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.388
Have you had any contact with him
in the last 24 hours?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.640
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

07:54.850 --> 07:57.143
Soren is on his own path.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.811
He's 10 years old.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.730
Our paths are not defined
by our solar age.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.567
-Michael says--
-I'm not interested in what Michael says.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.819
You're his mother. What do you say?

08:07.195 --> 08:09.572
Soren will return on his own time.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.199
Until then, I just wanna be.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.675
I hope you're hungry.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.970
-If it's anything like the tea--
-No harmful ingredients.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.430
Except too much butter.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.809
Is that supposed to be a heart?

08:39.895 --> 08:44.148
I can never get it right. Your mother
will make more when she gets home.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.816
My mother?

08:49.571 --> 08:52.114
It'd be nice to see her again.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.624
-These are really good.
-Same as when you were a little girl.

09:04.794 --> 09:09.048
That song you were humming yesterday,
it reminds me of something.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.092
I would sing it to you
when you were scared.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.517
I see why you like it here.
It's just like Montana.

09:20.727 --> 09:25.314
Coming here was a second chance
to repay my debt to humanity...

09:25.523 --> 09:28.108
...and protect my legacy.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.823
Whatever you're protecting, I'm sick now.
I don't have much time.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.742
Don't worry.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.911
You will begin the therapy soon.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.498
-You have a therapy?
-The disease is not important.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.584
We must consider
what's best for the family.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.588
I think I see them coming now.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.386
Let's go inside.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.930
I have a surprise for you.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.517
You know...

10:01.726 --> 10:04.436
...I've never been
a big fan of surprises.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.814
What about that therapy?

10:07.023 --> 10:11.110
If I told you,
then it wouldn't be a surprise.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.779
If you just untie me,
I promise I won't leave.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.864
Don't be afraid.

10:16.658 --> 10:19.576
Therapy will help you join the family.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.869
Join them how?

10:29.004 --> 10:31.922
We saved a place at the table
just for you.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.926
No. No, you can't make me
like one of them.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.603
Friends, please.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.439
Please.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.030
I have gathered us....

10:57.032 --> 10:58.240
Please listen.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.326
Friends.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.872
Stop!

11:26.269 --> 11:29.688
I'm here to share my thoughts
with you openly...

11:31.024 --> 11:37.112
...and to answer all your questions
as best I can about the recent tragedies.

11:37.572 --> 11:41.200
Carson, tell me your truth.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.334
We've all heard the rumors.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.545
Isaac and the boy.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.298
Soren gone.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.052
Travis killing Misha.

12:01.346 --> 12:05.432
And now Jerome is missing too.
Are we all gonna get sick and die?

12:06.476 --> 12:10.646
-What are we supposed to do?
-Uncertain as we all are...

12:12.023 --> 12:16.151
...we must uphold our routine.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.779
Continue the harvest.

12:19.614 --> 12:24.827
Do not allow yourselves
to be consumed...

12:25.036 --> 12:29.123
...by the doubts and fears
of a world we left behind.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.252
Now, the doctors from the CDC--

12:33.461 --> 12:34.837
Why should we trust them?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.590
Everything was fine
until they showed up.

12:40.135 --> 12:45.389
Their paths brought them here
to help us.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.436
We must accept their help...

12:51.604 --> 12:54.231
...and give back in return.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.484
But remember...

12:59.195 --> 13:02.739
...hold to your true self.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.661
Do not become someone else.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.039
Just be.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.627
Just be.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.595
They're mourning, Michael.
Give them time.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.723
I mourn too, Anne. Deeply.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.893
Did you know Misha was with child?

13:31.436 --> 13:34.563
-We've all lost part of our family.
-My family.

13:35.899 --> 13:40.569
And what good is a family that can't
protect the innocence of its children?

13:40.778 --> 13:44.239
It was the disease
that made them violent.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.450
Not according to the CDC.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.538
Whatever happened to the children,
it's over now.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.750
The harvest continues
and the crop is plentiful.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.253
Everything will be back to normal soon.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.548
We are a simple community...

14:02.217 --> 14:05.677
...run by a simple principle.

14:06.596 --> 14:08.639
We must feel...

14:09.474 --> 14:11.350
...safe.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.939
Uncertainty...

14:19.567 --> 14:22.194
...is like a blight on the crop.

14:26.449 --> 14:27.616
We cannot...

14:28.993 --> 14:30.869
...allow that.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.122
I need you three...

14:35.041 --> 14:38.001
...to handle the matter discretely.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.546
I'm trusting you.

14:44.509 --> 14:48.512
My three best girls.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.351
We won't disappoint you.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.396
That's a promise.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.734
Good.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.739
I don't need any more pictures
on this wall just yet.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.876
When you act alone, it affects all of us.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.297
-How could you be so selfish?
-Michael thinks you can't run things.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.633
Don't turn this around on me.
You're in charge of the children.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.928
Grace told me that Landry
was alone with them before the attack.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.055
Landry? What does that
have to do with me?

15:32.265 --> 15:36.143
Amy, please. If you keep acting out,
I can't protect the family.

15:36.352 --> 15:40.022
Well, maybe you're not the one
who should be protecting the family.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.108
You watch your tongue.

15:44.110 --> 15:48.780
And you. "Please this, please that."
One doesn't beg for respect.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.368
-You hit me.
-I know what you do...

15:53.536 --> 15:56.580
...and who you do it with.
I've allowed you your games...

15:56.748 --> 16:01.293
...but now your actions threaten
to destroy everything we've worked for.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.465
We must work together.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.383
Don't forget what's most important.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.928
Where would we be
if anything happened to Mother?

16:17.727 --> 16:20.896
-This is where you're working?
-Not exactly state-of-the-art, I know.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.982
This stuff wasn't state-of-the-art
20 years ago.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.276
How do you expect
to isolate this pathogen?

16:26.444 --> 16:27.653
We've already isolated it.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.449
-Sarah.
-Yeah.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.787
-That is one nasty gash you got.
-You should see the other guy.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.374
Bullshit. What really happened?

16:40.875 --> 16:42.417
I told you, it's personal.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.170
Personal? Like the last eight months?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.840
No phone call. Not even an e-mail.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.803
I'd of thought you'd be glad
to see me disappear.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.890
Yeah, we've had our differences.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.976
That doesn't mean I want you
to bleed to death on some island.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.355
Why here, of all places?
What are you looking for?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.983
You want to stitch me up, fine.
But I'm not playing 20 Questions.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.987
-So you've got nothing to say?
-I'll tell you the same thing I told Sarah.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.740
You need to leave this place.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.826
And I'll tell you something.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.954
We're not going anywhere
until we contain this thing.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.042
When I was a kid,
I had a pet goldfish named Copernicus.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.252
You serious?

17:25.420 --> 17:28.422
And he got really sick,
some kind of gill infection.

17:28.631 --> 17:32.801
Then I woke up one morning,
and he wasn't in his bowl.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.972
And that's the day you found your
true calling and decided to join the CDC?

17:37.181 --> 17:40.851
-Hot Zone, that's a real touching story.
-Don't call me that.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.604
Anyway, I spent a solid week
looking for him...

17:44.772 --> 17:47.941
...which is one week longer
than Olivia'll spend looking for Soren.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.068
How does somebody
give up on their son?

17:50.903 --> 17:51.987
Denial?

17:53.406 --> 17:56.700
-Maybe she just can't admit she's wrong.
-Maybe.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.870
But she knows something.
I'm gonna talk to her again.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.832
Just be careful.
Belief is a slippery slope.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.710
Push too hard...

18:06.919 --> 18:09.796
...she might just take you
off the cliff with her.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.133
Take a look at this.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.762
Skin's raised.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.347
It's a puncture wound,
too small to be a needle.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.141
It could be a bite or sting.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.436
Doesn't fit our profile...

18:24.812 --> 18:28.106
...but we might just be looking at
an insect-borne vector.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.633
Please, Father.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.761
You don't have to do this.
I want to join the family. I'm ready.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.764
But not like this.

19:04.477 --> 19:08.063
-But what about Daniel? He hates me.
-He's your brother.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.607
I'm your real daughter,
your flesh and blood.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.402
He's threatened by me.
You don't wanna risk losing him again.

19:15.655 --> 19:19.574
-Daniel will never leave.
-But how can you be sure?

19:20.535 --> 19:23.703
-Dad.
-I'd love to go fishing, Daniel...

19:23.871 --> 19:25.580
...but I'm busy.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.963
I've been waiting on the porch
for over an hour.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.589
Oh, I get it.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.008
I should've known you'd be with her.

19:37.218 --> 19:40.512
Daniel, please.
I'll take you fishing another time.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.222
We made these plans weeks ago.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.938
I know it's a perfect day,
but there will be more.

19:50.773 --> 19:55.151
I promise I'll make it up to you.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.903
Okay?

19:58.823 --> 20:01.783
It's not the same as before.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.871
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm not going anywhere.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.747
Take him fishing.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.088
Very well.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.546
Son of a bitch!

21:01.469 --> 21:03.011
Alan?

21:05.556 --> 21:07.807
-What happened?
-Someone cracked him on the head.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.143
-Dumped him behind the orchard.
-It was nothing.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.854
If they wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead already.

21:13.356 --> 21:15.023
Kyle Sommer.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.317
-Alan Farragut.
-Yeah, I know.

21:17.860 --> 21:18.985
I heard a lot about you.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.238
-That could be trouble.
-Not at all.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.865
Sarah speaks highly of you.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.037
I gotta get back to the Abbey.

21:29.830 --> 21:30.914
No.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.750
-We need your help.
-I'm not CDC anymore.

21:33.918 --> 21:37.003
But we have 30 victims,
29 of which are presumed dead.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.381
What about the 30th?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.716
He got better.

21:46.472 --> 21:50.392
Blood serum data on the victims
show elevated alkaloid levels...

21:50.559 --> 21:54.896
...including derivatives of lysergic acid
and agroclavine.

21:55.064 --> 21:58.984
-That is consistent with fungal poisoning.
-Yet everyone is on the same strict diet.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.528
-And only three became Mycotic.
-"Mycotic?"

22:01.696 --> 22:03.822
It's what we're calling
the infected victims.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.741
"Myco" for fungus, plus "psychotic."

22:07.576 --> 22:08.660
Catchy.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.870
-Any luck with the food testing?
-Not so far.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.665
Stomach contents in all three
of our island victims...

22:13.833 --> 22:15.750
...tested negative
for fungal metabolites.

22:15.918 --> 22:19.087
Which means the source breaks
down quickly enough to be undetectable.

22:19.255 --> 22:22.090
All three had elevated
hemoglobin A-1-C levels.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.010
Yup. Soren and Isaac
had quite the sweet tooth.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.512
But the diet here is restricted.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.473
Mainly fruits and vegetables,
high fiber, water content.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.183
No processed sugars allowed.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.353
You sure you guys aren't hiding
a cotton-candy cart somewhere?

22:35.521 --> 22:38.648
Soren, Isaac, and Travis must have
eaten something outside the diet.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.734
That's how they ingested the pathogen.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.527
Sarah, go talk to Olivia.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.779
Kyle, track down Travis' crew.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.157
Maybe one of them caught him
sneaking a KitKat.

22:52.663 --> 22:53.705
I think I'm done here.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.962
What, so that's it? You're out of here?

23:01.130 --> 23:02.964
I've done what I can do.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.008
I have to get back.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.760
This is about Julia, isn't it?

23:06.927 --> 23:08.720
About getting her back.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.515
When I went to Paris to find Julia,
I expected to find a prisoner of Ilaria...

23:12.683 --> 23:14.476
...not one of its leaders.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.437
Julia?

23:17.980 --> 23:19.564
-That's crazy.
-Why?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.609
She's an immortal now,
just like the rest of them.

23:22.777 --> 23:26.196
I think Ilaria is behind everything
that's happening on this island.

23:26.363 --> 23:30.658
What would a multinational corporation
want with a bunch of New Age farmers?

23:30.826 --> 23:34.037
-It doesn't make any sense.
-Any more than immortality itself?

23:34.205 --> 23:38.333
Narvik, Mycosis, they're all just
symptoms of a bigger sickness.

23:38.501 --> 23:40.043
Immortals are the real plague.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.962
So you're just gonna kill them all?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.172
Including Julia?

23:45.007 --> 23:47.801
And how about Sarah?
You saving a bullet for her too?

23:47.968 --> 23:51.304
-I don't have to explain myself to you.
-I know, of course you don't.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.641
We all know there's no problem
the great Alan Farragut can't solve.

23:56.852 --> 24:01.106
You know, Peter, it's a lucky thing
you found me this morning.

24:01.732 --> 24:04.109
-Really lucky.
-What is that supposed to mean?

24:04.276 --> 24:06.945
There are, what, over 200 acres
inside these walls.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.824
And the first one to stumble on me
is you.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.493
You know what? Forget it.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.329
I'm sorry I saved your ass.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.960
Even with the tiniest nick,
the jars have to be recycled.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.130
No good if we can't get an airtight seal.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.466
So everything is grown here locally?

24:28.634 --> 24:29.968
Every last seed and stem.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.096
It seems very healthy.

24:33.264 --> 24:37.350
Michael says the bounty of the earth
is ours to master.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.561
You must get tired
of the same thing though.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.021
When I was a kid, I loved Red Vines.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.815
I still do.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.360
Soren, he.... He must have liked
something sweet every once in a while.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.946
Candy?

24:50.114 --> 24:51.531
We don't allow that here.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.575
Are you sure?

24:53.742 --> 24:56.786
Because he had something sweet
right before he got sick.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.247
You must be mistaken.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.082
The blood tests prove it.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.500
I know my son.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.837
-And he would never break the rules.
-Why don't you help me find him?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.213
You can ask him yourself.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.341
Soren will return on his own time.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.594
-But what if he doesn't?
-He will.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.388
He packed a bag.
He even brought his favorite buddy-bear.

25:15.556 --> 25:19.392
People are gonna keep getting sick.
Soren is the only one who got better.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.604
-And we need to know why.
-You skeptics think you know everything.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.606
But no one was sick
before you got here.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.692
Maybe you brought the disease
from the outside.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.208
Hey, it's me.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.210
Why are you calling
on an unsecured line?

25:45.377 --> 25:48.087
-I think Alan suspects something.
-Did he say something?

25:48.255 --> 25:52.717
No, no, no. He didn't say anything.
It's just, he keeps bringing up Ilaria.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.219
I need to know.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.803
What is going on here?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.265
What the hell
have you gotten me into?

25:59.433 --> 26:02.518
Don't worry. We can deal with Alan.

26:02.686 --> 26:06.147
Now here's what you need to do.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.436
Look at this mess.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.938
I'm very disappointed in you.

28:13.650 --> 28:18.363
You know, I remember
why I know that song.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.032
I was just a little girl.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.494
I would hear these angry voices.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.746
A man and a woman
yelling at each other.

28:26.914 --> 28:30.541
It was you and Jaye arguing about me.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.210
I would start crying.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.420
And you would sing that song
to make me stop.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.839
Daniel was right about you.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.470
Daniel isn't here. He's dead.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.764
-More lies.
-No, no, it's true.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.684
And Jaye is dead too.
They died at Arctic Biosystems.

28:48.852 --> 28:52.230
-Enough!
-If you do this, I will die.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.525
We are immortal.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.235
We live forever.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.820
I won't heal from this.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.321
You know that's true.

29:01.031 --> 29:04.367
No. You killed all of those people.
Please.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.662
Oh, please. Please, please, please.
You have to remember. Please.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.872
I don't want to remember.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.457
Please.

29:26.306 --> 29:30.435
Oh, God. Oh, God.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.527
Please let me hug you.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.782
Please, Dad.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.756
Julia!

32:04.339 --> 32:06.757
And the winner is...

32:06.925 --> 32:08.676
...toxic.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.764
Not gonna ask how long
you've been there.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.308
Long enough.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.893
-What have you got?
-Honey.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.146
Tracked down a massive hive
on the north wall.

32:20.314 --> 32:22.273
Sample's crawling with mycotoxin.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.233
Well, it fits the profile.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.945
It's high fructose, ingestible,
degrades rapidly.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.906
-Are the bees carriers?
-Thankfully, no.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.658
Nearly got myself stung.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.202
-Damn it, Kyle.
-I'm fine.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.496
You're lucky. It's not the same thing.

33:23.585 --> 33:25.086
You have good instincts.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.171
I've had a long time to practice.

33:38.975 --> 33:41.268
Not nearly enough.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.895
I wish I could have taught you.

33:56.743 --> 33:57.910
Come on, Julia.

34:29.109 --> 34:32.111
We should have done this
a long time ago. Then maybe I'd be free.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.822
No.

34:34.990 --> 34:40.202
As long as you live, there will always
be a part of you that is me.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.456
Take it.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.042
Please.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.219
It is my legacy.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.942
What does it mean?

35:57.948 --> 36:00.032
I should have never...

36:00.909 --> 36:03.410
...made you like me.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.334
I'm sorry, Julia.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.879
I'm sorry.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.849
Go.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.240
It's okay, Father.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.992
We're here.

37:38.048 --> 37:40.841
We'll never leave you, Hiroshi.

38:22.092 --> 38:23.133
Olivia.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.719
-Just leave me alone.
-Please. I need to talk to you.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.973
You're trying to judge me,
trying to blind me to my path.

38:29.683 --> 38:30.933
Please, just hear me out.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.060
I used to know people like you.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.229
People who thought
they were better than me.

38:35.397 --> 38:38.440
But Michael's opened my eyes
so I can be free of your judgment.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.193
I thought you deserved
to know the truth.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.571
What is this?

38:44.739 --> 38:47.658
It's Soren's bear.
You said he took it with him.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.744
-He did.
-Then why did I find it with another child?

38:54.082 --> 38:55.124
I don't believe you.

38:55.291 --> 38:58.085
Soren needs his mother right now.
Please help me--

38:58.253 --> 39:00.087
Michael says to each
his own unique path.

39:00.255 --> 39:03.716
Michael is lying to you.
He's lying to everybody.

39:03.883 --> 39:07.094
-Michael would never do that.
-The proof is right in front of you.

39:14.728 --> 39:17.146
This isn't Soren's bear.
You're trying to trick me.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.023
No, no, no. Olivia.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.735
Maybe you're the one who took Soren.
You did experiments on him.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.570
Please, just put the knife down.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.406
Maybe you're the ones
who are making everyone sick.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.774
My baby.
