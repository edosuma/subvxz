00:03.158 --> 00:07.036
Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary party?

00:07.287 --> 00:08.329
- Sure.
- Yeah.

00:08.496 --> 00:11.791
- Who's the guy?
- Parker, I met him at the dry cleaners.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.170
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

00:17.797 --> 00:19.799
Who said that?

00:20.133 --> 00:25.054
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

00:25.346 --> 00:27.015
And he treats me like a queen.

00:27.182 --> 00:30.143
Except at night, when he treats me
like the naughty girl I am.

00:32.311 --> 00:35.190
Oh, by the way, would it be okay
if I give the toast this year?

00:35.523 --> 00:38.318
Are you sure you want to
after what happened at their 20th?

00:38.526 --> 00:43.031
- Yeah, I'd really like to.
- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

00:43.281 --> 00:48.661
Yes. Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

00:48.870 --> 00:54.542
- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

00:54.709 --> 00:59.881
No, really, any time Ross makes a toast,
everyone cries and pats him on the back.

01:00.089 --> 01:04.802
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

01:05.053 --> 01:09.390
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

01:10.892 --> 01:13.895
Well, I can promise you,
at least one person will be crying.

01:14.062 --> 01:18.316
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

01:18.525 --> 01:22.570
- Really? You can do that?
- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

01:32.455 --> 01:35.917
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me.

02:16.416 --> 02:19.794
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on my toast for the party.

02:19.961 --> 02:23.464
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

02:24.674 --> 02:26.884
- Hey, check this out.
- It's a dog.

02:27.093 --> 02:29.637
It's a dead dog.

02:29.887 --> 02:32.807
That's Chi-Chi.
She died when I was in high school.

02:33.016 --> 02:36.936
- You're gonna talk about their dead pet?
- It's good stuff, huh?

02:39.147 --> 02:40.648
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:40.898 --> 02:43.985
Joey? You got a present for my parents?
That's so sweet.

02:44.152 --> 02:48.072
Yeah. In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

02:48.239 --> 02:49.324
Aw.

02:49.490 --> 02:55.413
- That is so cool.
- And I got them Kama Sutra for the Elderly.

02:56.122 --> 02:58.958
- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

02:59.167 --> 03:05.673
What do you need? We got, uh, lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt...

03:06.674 --> 03:09.552
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

03:11.846 --> 03:17.852
AW. Chi-Chi. Oh, I loved this dog.

03:18.019 --> 03:22.649
You know, uh, Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

03:23.816 --> 03:28.863
- What?
- You were the 200-pounder who rode her.

03:32.367 --> 03:36.037
Hey. Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is...

03:36.329 --> 03:41.250
No, wait, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...

03:41.501 --> 03:43.503
...and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

03:45.838 --> 03:49.258
Chandler, I'm kidding.
Already you're my favorite.

03:49.509 --> 03:54.389
- Tell me a little about yourselves.
- Uh, actually, we should get going.

03:56.349 --> 03:57.767
Classic Ross.

04:00.395 --> 04:03.898
Rachel, Rachel, look how you glow.
May I?

04:04.524 --> 04:06.484
I think you already are.

04:06.693 --> 04:10.113
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

04:10.571 --> 04:16.035
Is there anything more miraculous...
Ooh, a picture of a dog. Whose is this?

04:17.704 --> 04:20.748
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

04:20.998 --> 04:27.088
Well, at least you were lucky to have him.
Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

04:29.257 --> 04:32.593
- So where's the party?
- Out on the island. It's in Massapequa.

04:32.885 --> 04:38.558
Massapequa, it sounds magical.
Is it steeped in Native American history?

04:38.766 --> 04:40.977
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

04:42.562 --> 04:45.231
- I've got my notes. You got the presents?
- Yeah.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.275
- I've got the car keys.
- We're driving?

04:47.442 --> 04:49.444
- Yeah.
- Aces.

04:52.238 --> 04:56.409
- So, uh, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like him a lot.

04:56.659 --> 05:01.581
- You want to hang back and take a cab?
- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

05:06.627 --> 05:09.922
- Oh.
- Hey.

05:10.089 --> 05:13.468
- Hey, Mom.
- This is such a great party.

05:13.843 --> 05:18.806
Thirty-five years. Very impressive.
Do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?

05:19.307 --> 05:23.561
- Jack?
- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

05:24.312 --> 05:27.815
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

05:29.567 --> 05:33.946
- Congratulations, you two.
- Thank you, we're so excited.

05:34.155 --> 05:36.574
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

05:37.408 --> 05:38.576
What?

05:38.743 --> 05:42.663
- Can we talk to you for just a moment?
- Yeah.

05:44.207 --> 05:45.958
It's just a little thing.

05:46.167 --> 05:50.838
While we think it's simply marvelous that
you're having this baby out of wedlock...

05:52.632 --> 05:55.510
...some of our friends
are less open-minded.

05:55.718 --> 05:58.304
- Which is why we told them you're married.
- What?

05:58.513 --> 06:01.015
Thanks for going along with this.

06:02.099 --> 06:06.521
- We have to pretend that we're married?
- Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight.

06:06.687 --> 06:08.022
You can do this.

06:09.732 --> 06:11.859
- Can you believe that?
- I know.

06:12.151 --> 06:16.489
If you're gonna do the ears, you may
as well take a pass at the nose area.

06:16.697 --> 06:19.992
No, no, I don't want to have to lie
about us being married.

06:20.201 --> 06:24.121
I know. I don't either.
But it's their party, and it's one night.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.874
We don't even have to lie.
We just won't say anything.

06:27.124 --> 06:30.419
If it comes up, we'll smile,
we'll nod along...

06:30.670 --> 06:31.712
- Ross?
- Rachel?

06:31.879 --> 06:35.216
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

06:35.383 --> 06:40.346
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

06:41.722 --> 06:46.227
- Here's something to get you started.
- So how's marriage treating you?

06:46.853 --> 06:50.022
- Unbelievable. It's great.
- I love marriage.

06:50.231 --> 06:51.649
We'll see you later.

06:51.858 --> 06:54.068
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:54.902 --> 06:57.905
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

06:58.155 --> 07:02.410
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C...

07:04.412 --> 07:08.791
...I feel so lucky. To think of all the
good times that have happened here.

07:08.958 --> 07:14.088
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat.

07:15.089 --> 07:19.260
But none of it will compare with tonight.
My God, I don't want to forget this moment.

07:19.427 --> 07:23.639
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

07:25.474 --> 07:28.603
I don't think the flash went off.

07:31.981 --> 07:34.567
- I'm gonna go find the men's room.
- I'll go with you.

07:34.734 --> 07:37.153
Somewhere, there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun...

07:37.320 --> 07:40.072
...and a huge butterfly net
looking for that man.

07:41.616 --> 07:46.454
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

07:46.704 --> 07:49.498
I'm so glad we weren't in the car.
Did he ever let up?

07:49.749 --> 07:54.003
He called the Long Island Expressway
a concrete miracle.

07:54.587 --> 07:57.465
This room. This night.

07:57.757 --> 08:03.638
That waiter. His shoes.
I must take a mental picture.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.473
Sorry.

08:09.143 --> 08:11.437
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

08:12.813 --> 08:15.608
That depends, how much did you hear?

08:17.443 --> 08:20.279
Well, he's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

08:20.446 --> 08:24.325
- It's just... It's so much.
- Well, so what? I like him.

08:24.492 --> 08:28.663
Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

08:28.955 --> 08:33.292
No, because friends don't do that.
But do you want my opinion?

08:33.458 --> 08:38.798
In my opinion, your collective dating record
reads like a who's who of human crap.

08:41.467 --> 08:44.762
- I feel terrible.
- I know.

08:45.846 --> 08:47.765
What was wrong with Mona?

08:53.354 --> 08:56.023
- Open it, open it, open it.
- Yeah, baby.

08:56.273 --> 09:00.152
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

09:00.361 --> 09:05.282
- We were surprised we weren't invited.
- Oh, no, it was just our parents.

09:05.449 --> 09:06.534
It was a small wedding.

09:06.701 --> 09:11.372
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

09:11.539 --> 09:16.377
- Where did you have it?
- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

09:16.627 --> 09:20.715
And Stevie Wonder sang "isn't She Lovely"
as I walked down the aisle.

09:20.881 --> 09:21.882
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:22.049 --> 09:26.053
- Stevie's an old family friend.
- Oh, my God. That sounds amazing.

09:26.303 --> 09:30.057
- I'd love to see pictures.
- Yeah, so would I.

09:30.307 --> 09:35.855
You wouldn't think that Annie Leibovitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

09:37.231 --> 09:39.692
Would you excuse us for a second?

09:42.570 --> 09:45.406
- Um, what are you doing?
- What? I'm not you.

09:45.573 --> 09:47.408
This may be the only wedding
leverhave.

09:49.660 --> 09:53.539
- And I want it to be amazing.
- Okay. Okay. Ooh. Ooh.

09:53.706 --> 09:58.002
- Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
- Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.

10:03.049 --> 10:07.178
Say, uh, ahem, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

10:07.386 --> 10:11.015
- No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
- And I'm with you.

10:11.182 --> 10:13.100
What a great time to be alive.

10:14.602 --> 10:17.563
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

10:18.606 --> 10:21.192
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

10:21.358 --> 10:22.693
Mm-hm. Yeah.

10:22.860 --> 10:26.864
- Ah. Oysters. Let me feed you one.
- That's not necessary.

10:27.073 --> 10:28.574
- Please?
- No, actually, I don't eat...

10:28.783 --> 10:32.119
- I won't quit until you try one.
- Okay, fine, fine.

10:33.454 --> 10:37.875
- Mm. Mm-hm. Good.
- What're they like? I've never had one.

10:39.877 --> 10:42.213
- Why don't you just try one?
- Nah, they look too weird.

10:45.591 --> 10:48.010
- What are you doing?
- Just going over my toast.

10:48.177 --> 10:50.346
Ah, those two will never know
what hit them.

10:50.513 --> 10:55.643
I can't wait. They're gonna cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

10:56.018 --> 10:59.730
You know, if you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just:

11:01.607 --> 11:06.654
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

11:06.904 --> 11:10.324
- Blind?
- Well, not at first, but it was intricate work.

11:10.616 --> 11:14.829
And they said even though they lost
their sight, it was all worth it.

11:15.287 --> 11:18.666
- I bet you looked beautiful.
- Oh, well, I don't know about that.

11:18.916 --> 11:22.503
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

11:24.296 --> 11:28.926
- How did you propose?
- Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

11:30.010 --> 11:34.181
Well, um, actually,
I took her to the planetarium.

11:34.598 --> 11:37.351
That's where we had our first date.

11:37.518 --> 11:43.190
Um, she walked in, and I had the room
filled with, uh, lilies, her favorite flower.

11:43.858 --> 11:47.653
- That is so sweet.
- Shh. I want to hear the rest.

11:49.196 --> 11:52.867
Then Fred Astaire singing, uh,
"The Way You Look Tonight"...

11:53.033 --> 11:55.953
...came on the sound system
and the lights came down...

11:56.120 --> 11:57.288
...and I got on one knee...

11:57.538 --> 12:01.876
...and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

12:02.126 --> 12:03.377
"Will you marry me?"

12:03.544 --> 12:05.212
Aw.

12:05.671 --> 12:09.717
And the ring was the size of my fist.

12:11.093 --> 12:14.346
Hey, uh, Phoebe? Look, uh...

12:15.890 --> 12:19.560
...I want to apologize about before, okay?
We were being jerks.

12:19.810 --> 12:22.438
Parker's a nice guy,
and I'd like to get to know him.

12:22.605 --> 12:23.856
Then you better do it now.

12:24.064 --> 12:26.525
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna kill him.

12:26.734 --> 12:28.444
- What?
- You guys were right.

12:28.611 --> 12:31.405
He's just too excited
about everything.

12:31.655 --> 12:36.035
I mean, I'm all for living life, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

12:36.243 --> 12:38.704
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

12:39.413 --> 12:41.415
I know. I'm having the worst time.

12:41.582 --> 12:45.753
There was a 15-minute line for the buffet,
and when I finally got up to the plates...

12:45.920 --> 12:49.173
...I slipped on a giant booger.

12:51.258 --> 12:54.428
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

12:55.262 --> 12:58.140
I guess it could've been.
I didn't really look at it.

12:58.390 --> 13:02.353
I just wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out of there.

13:02.603 --> 13:06.523
I just thought he was such a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

13:06.732 --> 13:10.152
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

13:10.402 --> 13:12.738
There's nothing wrong with him.
He's a good guy.

13:12.947 --> 13:14.949
- You think?
- Yeah, know what I think?

13:15.157 --> 13:18.911
- We were all just being too negative.
- You're right.

13:19.161 --> 13:24.208
You're right. He's just embracing life.
We could all stand to be more like Parker.

13:24.375 --> 13:27.962
You know what? I am like him.
I'm a sunny, positive person.

13:28.420 --> 13:31.465
- Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
- What's that now?

13:33.592 --> 13:36.303
- Oh, it's Parker.
- Look, the Bunny Hop.

13:36.595 --> 13:38.222
- Oh, I love it.
- You do?

13:38.430 --> 13:43.143
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on.

13:45.062 --> 13:47.773
Okay, it's time for the toast.

13:47.940 --> 13:51.944
I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'm gonna do it.

13:54.113 --> 13:57.658
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

13:58.492 --> 13:59.910
Okay, um...

14:00.160 --> 14:04.498
Mom, Dad, when I got married...

14:04.748 --> 14:08.168
...one of the things
that made me sure that I could do it...

14:08.335 --> 14:10.796
...was the amazing example
the two of you set for me.

14:11.422 --> 14:15.092
For that, and for so many other things,
I wanna say thank you.

14:15.301 --> 14:18.887
I know I probably don't
say it enough...

14:19.722 --> 14:21.765
...but I love you.

14:32.651 --> 14:35.195
When I look around this room...

14:35.362 --> 14:39.241
...I'm saddened by the thought
of those who could not be with us.

14:39.533 --> 14:43.787
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

14:45.205 --> 14:47.041
But she can't...

14:47.291 --> 14:48.876
...because she's dead.

14:52.713 --> 14:55.632
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

14:57.676 --> 15:00.679
I mean, look how cute she is... Was.

15:03.265 --> 15:05.851
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

15:06.060 --> 15:11.148
Remember, um, she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

15:14.985 --> 15:16.820
Wow.

15:19.239 --> 15:20.783
Um...

15:21.700 --> 15:23.577
Hey, does anybody remember when...

15:23.869 --> 15:29.416
...Debra Winger had to say goodbye
to her children in Terms of Endearment?

15:30.876 --> 15:32.378
Didn't see that?

15:33.295 --> 15:35.839
No movie fans?

15:37.591 --> 15:39.593
You want to hear something sad?

15:39.760 --> 15:41.595
Um, the other day
I was watching 60 Minutes...

15:41.762 --> 15:44.264
...and there was this piece
on these orphans in Romania...

15:44.515 --> 15:48.310
...who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

15:54.942 --> 15:58.320
You people are made of stone.

15:58.529 --> 16:00.781
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever.

16:08.205 --> 16:11.708
Thank you, Monica.
That was, uh, interesting.

16:11.959 --> 16:15.921
- Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
- Why don't I remember this dog?

16:19.299 --> 16:22.219
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

16:22.428 --> 16:25.514
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

16:26.557 --> 16:30.936
You're not gonna say anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

16:32.396 --> 16:34.148
No, of course, um...

16:36.358 --> 16:41.905
Um, everybody?
Um, ahem, I just wanted to say...

16:42.072 --> 16:45.951
...uh, on behalf of my new bride,
Rachel...

16:49.246 --> 16:53.167
...and myself, um, that if...

16:53.876 --> 16:59.339
If in 35 years,
we're half as happy as you guys are...

16:59.590 --> 17:02.634
...we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

17:04.303 --> 17:06.262
Oh, Ross.

17:09.308 --> 17:13.936
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

17:20.527 --> 17:23.946
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

17:25.406 --> 17:29.620
Can I, um, get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

17:30.787 --> 17:35.000
I must say, this apartment,
it's... there are no words.

17:35.209 --> 17:37.836
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a haven.

17:38.045 --> 17:43.383
- A third-floor paradise, a modern-day Eden.
- Yeah, I know, I know. Uh-huh. Gotcha.

17:43.550 --> 17:50.015
Listen, why don't we just, um, sit and relax,
you know, just be with each other quietly.

17:50.641 --> 17:52.559
- That sounds great.
- Uh-huh.

17:53.393 --> 17:57.314
My God, this is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on in my entire life.

17:57.564 --> 18:00.442
Let's try something else.
Let's play a game.

18:00.651 --> 18:03.445
- I love games.
- Shocking.

18:03.612 --> 18:07.407
Um, let's play the game of...

18:08.033 --> 18:10.327
...who can stay quiet the longest.

18:12.246 --> 18:13.747
Or Jenga.

18:14.957 --> 18:20.128
Let's play this one first, and remember,
whoever talks first loses.

18:24.758 --> 18:29.263
- I lose, now Jenga.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18:30.264 --> 18:33.517
- Is something wrong?
- Wrong? You know the word "wrong"?

18:33.684 --> 18:36.270
Everything isn't perfect?
Everything isn't magical?

18:36.562 --> 18:40.274
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of a million fairies?

18:40.524 --> 18:42.776
They were just brake lights, Parker.

18:42.943 --> 18:47.030
Well, excuse me for putting
a good spin on a traffic jam.

18:47.781 --> 18:51.034
But you don't have to put
a good spin on everything.

18:51.243 --> 18:54.288
I'm sorry. That's who I am.
I'm a positive person.

18:54.454 --> 18:55.998
No, I'm a positive person.

18:56.248 --> 19:00.377
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

19:00.627 --> 19:04.256
At Disneyland, getting laid.

19:05.215 --> 19:07.801
So, what do you want me to do?
You want me to be more negative?

19:07.968 --> 19:11.555
- You want me to be less happy?
- Much less happy.

19:11.930 --> 19:15.892
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

19:17.811 --> 19:19.313
So long.

19:19.479 --> 19:24.484
Hey. Don't let the best door in the world
hit you in the ass on your way out.

19:29.323 --> 19:33.952
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've ever had in your entire life?

19:36.622 --> 19:42.794
We could've gone from the ceremony
to the reception with you in the sidecar.

19:43.003 --> 19:44.838
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.

19:45.088 --> 19:49.593
But having a dove place the ring
on your finger would've been no problem.

19:52.137 --> 19:54.056
It was really fun
being married to you tonight.

19:54.222 --> 19:57.351
Yeah, and it was the easiest 400 bucks
I ever made.

19:58.935 --> 20:02.439
- Okay, Ross, can I, um, ask you something?
- Yeah.

20:02.689 --> 20:07.319
- That proposal at the planetarium?
- I know, I know. It was stupid.

20:07.527 --> 20:13.450
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

20:13.617 --> 20:18.705
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

20:19.039 --> 20:22.167
Uh, no, actually, I thought about it
when we were going out.

20:22.376 --> 20:27.130
That's how I imagined
I, uh, would ask you to marry me.

20:28.048 --> 20:29.633
Wow.

20:30.550 --> 20:35.055
Well, that would've been, uh,
very hard to say no to.

20:38.016 --> 20:39.685
Well, it's a good thing I didn't do it...

20:39.851 --> 20:43.480
...because it sounds like it would have been
a very expensive wedding.

20:49.695 --> 20:53.407
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

20:55.909 --> 21:00.664
Uh, even if the sidecar had a windscreen
so your hair wouldn't get messed up?

21:00.872 --> 21:04.209
- I will think about it.
- That's all I'm asking.

21:07.921 --> 21:10.215
Okay, that's it. I give up.

21:10.424 --> 21:14.094
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you're the one giving the speech.

21:14.261 --> 21:18.014
You know, I don't understand why
they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.

21:18.223 --> 21:21.309
- Oh, come on.
- Hey. That stuff you said about true love?

21:21.601 --> 21:26.106
You were right. I mean,
we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad.

21:26.314 --> 21:30.026
And that picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

21:30.277 --> 21:31.862
And what you said about Nana?

21:32.028 --> 21:36.700
Oh, yeah, she really would've
wanted to be there.

21:37.159 --> 21:39.619
And you know what?

21:40.704 --> 21:42.831
I think she was.

21:44.291 --> 21:47.961
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it'?
