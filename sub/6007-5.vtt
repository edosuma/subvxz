<i>Evolving technologies</i>

00:07.617 --> 00:12.128
<i>Dangerous advancements forever</i>

00:12.161 --> 00:15.336
<i>Police are not prepared.</i>

00:15.369 --> 00:17.942
<i>Law enforcement combats</i>
<i>this corruption</i>

00:17.975 --> 00:21.520

00:21.553 --> 00:24.793

RUDY: <i>The idea behind the DRNs
was to be as human as possible.</i>

00:30.110 --> 00:32.610

Detective Kennex?

01:45.310 --> 01:47.316
May I help you?

DORIAN:
John?

01:49.014 --> 01:50.454
What are you doing down here?

01:50.487 --> 01:52.383
I was, uh...
I was just looking, uh, for you.

01:52.424 --> 01:53.919
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.423
I'm-I'm, uh...
I'm, uh... I'm great.

01:55.456 --> 01:56.824
Cool.

01:56.857 --> 01:58.296
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:58.329 --> 01:59.832
They're replacing
my chest plate.

01:59.865 --> 02:02.529
We have to go by Rudy's later
and pick one up.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.833
Okay.

02:03.866 --> 02:05.906
We'll... we'll do that.

02:11.986 --> 02:14.188
Oh, I can't get it
out of my head.

02:14.222 --> 02:15.326
What are you talking about?

02:15.359 --> 02:16.958
The life-sized Ken doll.

02:16.991 --> 02:18.158
That's what's bothering you?

02:18.199 --> 02:19.430
I'm the one that
lives with them.

02:19.463 --> 02:20.567
I have no privacy,

02:20.600 --> 02:21.703
and they glare at me with their

02:21.736 --> 02:23.767
lifeless eyes.
I'm miserable.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.306
You need to talk
to Captain Maldonado.

02:25.339 --> 02:26.978
Talk to Maldonado...
about what?

02:27.011 --> 02:29.546
I need my own place.
You gotta be kidding me.

02:29.579 --> 02:31.282
- You saw how awful it was down there.
- Yeah.

02:31.315 --> 02:33.284
It's burned into
my brain forever.

02:33.317 --> 02:34.886
Welcome to my world.

02:39.095 --> 02:40.422
You're, uh...

02:40.463 --> 02:41.631
you know, you're not...

02:41.664 --> 02:44.296
like that down there, are you?

02:45.536 --> 02:48.569
Not that it's any
of your business...

02:48.602 --> 02:50.441
but my designer
was much more thoughtful.

02:50.474 --> 02:51.874
I'm made to look human.

02:51.907 --> 02:53.978
Oh, okay, good.
I can show you.

02:54.011 --> 02:54.946
No, no, no. What are you doing?
(zipper unzips)

02:54.979 --> 02:57.210
No, no. Oh, my G...

02:57.251 --> 02:58.715
Is that all for one person?

02:58.748 --> 03:00.849
Dude, put it away.

03:00.882 --> 03:02.384
(zips up) Wait.

03:02.417 --> 03:03.688
You're a robot.

03:03.721 --> 03:05.088
What... what do you do with it?

03:05.121 --> 03:07.254
Probably the same thing
you do with yours...

03:07.287 --> 03:09.255
nothing.

03:09.288 --> 03:10.854
I do plenty with mine.

03:10.887 --> 03:12.494
Oh, yeah?
Plenty.

03:12.527 --> 03:13.926
Yeah? What's up
with Detective Stahl?

03:13.959 --> 03:15.923
What about her?
The way she smiles at you...

03:15.956 --> 03:17.361
the way she says your name...

03:17.394 --> 03:18.761
(Valerie's voice):
John...

03:18.794 --> 03:19.857
Oh, please, don't.

03:19.898 --> 03:21.361
She likes you.
Come on.

03:21.394 --> 03:22.960
We work together, so...

03:22.993 --> 03:24.928
(Valerie's voice):
Your fake leg is really sexy.

03:24.968 --> 03:26.167
(chuckles)

03:26.200 --> 03:28.831
Captain Maldonado, you said

03:28.871 --> 03:31.533
you oversaw the investigation
of this case.

03:31.566 --> 03:33.637
Can you elaborate
on what you found

03:33.670 --> 03:34.869
at the crime scene?

03:34.902 --> 03:36.774
I saw Dr. Fuller, the victim,

03:36.807 --> 03:38.710
lying dead on the ground
in a parking garage,

03:38.743 --> 03:40.173
adjacent to a clinic

03:40.214 --> 03:41.677
where he worked as
a fertility specialist.

03:41.711 --> 03:43.614
Could you be a little
more specific? Yes.

03:43.647 --> 03:45.046
There were three shots...

03:45.087 --> 03:46.549
two bullets to the chest,
one to the head...

03:46.583 --> 03:48.150
at point-blank range.

03:48.191 --> 03:51.992
I know that because
the residue from the gunpowder

03:52.025 --> 03:54.389
had blackened the wounds
around Dr. Fuller's skin.

03:54.422 --> 03:55.925
Sounds brutal.

03:55.958 --> 03:57.028
It was.

03:57.061 --> 03:58.259
Whoever did this

03:58.292 --> 04:00.163
must be a horrible person,

04:00.196 --> 04:03.130
with a record of
doing horrible things.

04:05.903 --> 04:07.671
I call your attention
to Exhibit C.

04:07.704 --> 04:10.442
This is the weapon
that was found

04:10.483 --> 04:11.578
next to the body of.

04:11.611 --> 04:13.178
Dr. Liam Fuller,
is it not?

04:13.218 --> 04:14.512
Yes.

04:14.553 --> 04:15.920
It's a high-capacity
assault pistol,

04:15.953 --> 04:17.216
banned for street use.

04:17.249 --> 04:19.055
FARLEY:
Were my client Ethan Avery's

04:19.088 --> 04:20.224
fingerprints on the gun?

04:20.257 --> 04:21.552
No, they were not.

04:21.593 --> 04:22.674
Nor were they at the scene.

04:22.689 --> 04:23.857
And did you find his

04:23.890 --> 04:26.266
DNA at the scene?
No, we did not.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.464
FARLEY: You're telling
me that my client,

04:28.497 --> 04:30.000
an upstanding citizen

04:30.033 --> 04:31.464
with no criminal record

04:31.497 --> 04:33.061
who donates a good portion

04:33.102 --> 04:34.394
of his inheritance
to charity...

04:34.427 --> 04:35.794
Objection, Your Honor,
irrelevant.

04:35.835 --> 04:36.960
JUDGE:
Sustained.

04:37.001 --> 04:38.126
Move it along.

04:38.167 --> 04:39.166
You're telling me

04:39.198 --> 04:40.427
that my client, Ethan Avery,

04:40.460 --> 04:42.898
brutally murdered
Dr. Liam Fuller...

04:42.931 --> 04:44.098
Yes, that's correct.

04:44.131 --> 04:46.202
...and you have
no physical evidence

04:46.234 --> 04:48.999
to connect my client
to the crime. Thank you.

04:49.032 --> 04:50.101
- But what we do have...
- FARLEY: Captain.

04:50.134 --> 04:51.466
- That'll be all.
- No.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.962
That's not all.
What we have

04:53.003 --> 04:54.002
is two eyewitnesses who saw

04:54.035 --> 04:55.266
your client
murder Dr. Fuller

04:55.299 --> 04:56.570
- in cold blood.
- I said no further questions.

04:56.603 --> 04:58.569
Two witnesses who are not
related to each other,

04:58.602 --> 04:59.904
- who were both at the scene of the crime...
- I... Your Honor.

04:59.937 --> 05:01.537
- ...who were able to pick out
of a lineup... - Objection.

05:01.570 --> 05:02.576
- JUDGE: Sustained.
- ...separately, that man,

05:02.609 --> 05:03.607
Ethan Avery.
(gavel pounding)

05:03.640 --> 05:04.711
That shuts the door
on reasonable doubt.

05:04.744 --> 05:07.144
- Your Honor...
- That's enough, Captain.

05:07.177 --> 05:08.415
You may step down.

05:08.448 --> 05:09.646
Thank you.

05:09.679 --> 05:12.317
(gallery murmuring)

05:12.350 --> 05:15.686
It's so stressful, isn't it?

05:15.719 --> 05:17.949
All this waiting.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.725
It's my first time
being a witness.

05:20.758 --> 05:22.924
Have you ever been a witness
in a murder trial?

05:22.957 --> 05:25.826
No, I've never been a witness.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.290
I like your scarf.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.394
It's your grandmother's,
isn't it?

05:30.427 --> 05:32.297
How did you know that?

05:32.330 --> 05:33.801
She told me.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.169
I'm sorry,

05:35.200 --> 05:36.599
but my grandmother's
been dead for a year.

05:36.632 --> 05:37.998
I know that.

05:38.031 --> 05:39.631
I'm a psychic.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.800
And a medium.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.270
A little bit of both, I guess.

05:42.303 --> 05:43.702
A medium psychic?

05:43.743 --> 05:46.174
On good days,
I'm a petite psychic.

05:48.543 --> 05:50.509
The lawyer asked me
not to mention it

05:50.542 --> 05:51.909
on the stand.

05:51.949 --> 05:53.614
But we're not on
the stand, so...

05:53.647 --> 05:54.886
No, I can't tell her that,

05:54.919 --> 05:56.415
she's about to testify.

05:56.460 --> 05:58.191
Tell me what?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.057
She thinks you're
ruining her scarf

06:01.090 --> 06:02.499
with your oily skin.

06:03.427 --> 06:05.494
Her words, not mine.

06:05.528 --> 06:07.629
I think your skin is lovely.

06:07.662 --> 06:09.198
I told you, nobody
wants to hear that.

06:09.231 --> 06:10.365
Haley Myers?

06:10.398 --> 06:11.732
They're ready for you.

06:12.667 --> 06:13.793
Don't worry.

06:13.834 --> 06:15.296
You're gonna be great.

06:22.676 --> 06:25.581
(scanner whirrs)

06:28.888 --> 06:30.950
Please raise your right hand.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.591
That wasn't nice.
I told you.

06:33.624 --> 06:34.758
I shouldn't have said anything.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.094
I always do that.

06:36.127 --> 06:38.093
Is the State ready to call
its next witness?

06:38.126 --> 06:39.326
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

06:39.359 --> 06:40.430
Um, as you know,
the two eyewitnesses

06:40.463 --> 06:41.966
are in protective custody,

06:41.999 --> 06:43.630
so to ensure their safety,
we're going to be

06:43.663 --> 06:45.636
broadcasting their
testimony remotely.

06:45.669 --> 06:47.299
That's fine.
Proceed.

06:47.332 --> 06:50.769
The State calls Haley Myers
to the stand.

06:54.169 --> 06:55.472
JUDGE: Have you been sworn in?

06:55.505 --> 06:56.737
I have.

06:56.778 --> 06:59.010
You may be seated.

07:01.682 --> 07:04.215
(clears throat)

07:04.248 --> 07:06.015
State your full name
for the record, please.

07:06.048 --> 07:07.717
Haley Jolene Myers.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.414
And what is your profession?

07:09.455 --> 07:10.551
I'm a registered nurse.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.488
Thank you,
Mrs. Myers.

07:12.521 --> 07:14.728
You were at the parking garage

07:14.761 --> 07:16.456
the day in question, were you not?
Yes.

07:16.496 --> 07:17.894
I was.

07:17.927 --> 07:20.126
You were going
to your car, correct?

07:20.159 --> 07:21.695
It was around 8:00 a.m.

07:21.728 --> 07:22.936
I had just

07:22.969 --> 07:24.267
finished my shift.

07:24.308 --> 07:25.371
ORTEGA: And can you
tell us what you saw?

07:25.404 --> 07:27.811
I, um...

07:27.844 --> 07:29.411
Yeah.

07:29.444 --> 07:30.746
It's all right, Mrs. Myers.

07:30.779 --> 07:32.208
Just... take your time.

07:32.241 --> 07:34.606
I saw a man

07:34.647 --> 07:37.216
striding toward a parked car.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.584
He was moving quickly,
like he had a purpose.

07:40.617 --> 07:43.781
Then I saw he was holding a gun.

07:47.851 --> 07:49.690
(distant gunfire)

07:49.723 --> 07:50.755
(gasps)

07:51.630 --> 07:52.695
Mrs. Myers?

07:52.728 --> 07:53.895
Something's happening.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.268
The safe house
has been compromised.

07:59.301 --> 08:00.764
Deploy now.

08:00.805 --> 08:01.571
(Haley screams)

08:01.604 --> 08:02.202
(gunshot)

08:02.235 --> 08:04.336
(gasps)

08:04.369 --> 08:05.568
(sobs)

08:05.601 --> 08:07.269
No!

08:07.302 --> 08:08.404
Someone help her!

08:08.437 --> 08:09.603
(gunshot)

08:09.637 --> 08:11.498
(gallery exclaiming, gasping)

08:13.770 --> 08:15.602
(officer grunting)

08:18.412 --> 08:19.610
Where's the other one?

08:19.643 --> 08:21.343
(distant gunshot)

08:25.012 --> 08:26.906
(gunshot)

08:26.947 --> 08:28.242
(panting)

08:30.212 --> 08:31.348
Whoa!

08:46.375 --> 08:48.045
(whirring)

08:48.078 --> 08:52.880
(indistinct conversations
and background radio chatter)

09:15.561 --> 09:17.192
Maya Vaughn.

09:17.233 --> 09:20.229
I'm a police officer.
You're gonna be okay.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.271
You're gonna be okay.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.934
What do we got?

09:27.975 --> 09:30.471
A single shooter,
entered by force,

09:30.512 --> 09:31.745
discharged
a large-caliber weapon,

09:31.778 --> 09:32.913
took out the bailiff first.

09:32.946 --> 09:35.647
Then shot and killed
Haley Myers,

09:35.680 --> 09:37.108
one of the witnesses in
the case against Avery.

09:37.126 --> 09:38.821
Any DNA? Prints?

09:38.847 --> 09:39.597
So far,

09:39.630 --> 09:41.459
nothing to give us an I.D.

09:44.465 --> 09:46.528
- Armor-piercing.
- Yeah.

09:46.561 --> 09:47.832
Probably purchased
on the black market.

09:47.865 --> 09:49.666
Any idea how the shooter
found the safe house?

09:49.697 --> 09:52.102
We found this tracker
on the bailiff.

09:52.135 --> 09:54.167
Someone must've figured out he
was on the protection detail.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.872
Followed him here.

09:55.905 --> 09:57.269
Any word on the other witness?

09:57.302 --> 09:59.737
Yeah, she's alive
and in custody.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.274
Good thing.
Because right now,

10:01.307 --> 10:03.243
she's the only thing
standing between

10:03.276 --> 10:04.644
Ethan Avery and his freedom.

10:16.561 --> 10:18.662
JOHN: I've got an eye for you.
(laughs)

10:18.695 --> 10:21.029
An eye for me, that's funny.

10:21.062 --> 10:23.429
Morbid, making your MX
hold the bin, isn't it?

10:23.462 --> 10:24.798
Oh, he can handle it, right?

10:24.831 --> 10:26.038
Affirmative.

10:26.072 --> 10:27.703
I can hold more
than a metric ton,

10:27.736 --> 10:29.207
which converts to

10:29.240 --> 10:31.672
2,204.6 pounds.

10:31.712 --> 10:34.113
I'm collecting pieces for Rudy.
If he can reassemble the MX,

10:34.146 --> 10:36.112
he might be able to pull
some footage from its CPU.

10:36.145 --> 10:37.879
- Mm.
- I.D. the shooter.

10:37.912 --> 10:39.119
The Knights just scored.
The score is now two to one.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.286
Hey, whoa...
whoa, buddy, stop.

10:40.319 --> 10:41.759
- I'm recording it.
- VALERIE: Oh, sorry.

10:41.785 --> 10:43.181
He's been updating me.

10:43.222 --> 10:44.485
I didn't know you were a fan.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.389
Glad I can surprise you.

10:47.423 --> 10:49.156
I better, uh...

10:49.189 --> 10:50.755
They just scored again.

10:50.788 --> 10:51.890
(Valerie laughs) JOHN:
Hey, you're ruining it.

10:51.923 --> 10:53.823
(laughing):
Sorry...

10:53.856 --> 10:55.221
Unbelievable.

10:59.924 --> 11:03.025
I bet you're having
a pretty bad day.

11:03.058 --> 11:05.761
A witness under police
protection murdered

11:05.794 --> 11:08.364
in front of an entire courtroom.

11:08.405 --> 11:10.372
You're not gonna
get away with this.

11:10.406 --> 11:11.973
Get away with what?

11:12.006 --> 11:14.679
I was in court. With you.

11:14.712 --> 11:18.047
You think you're so smart.
I don't get

11:18.080 --> 11:21.916
how a guy with a 180 IQ
could be so sloppy.

11:23.114 --> 11:25.344
Your assassin didn't complete
the job.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.113
I'm sure the warden told you
I've had no visitation,

11:30.146 --> 11:32.415
phone calls or correspondence
since I got here, so...

11:32.448 --> 11:34.350
how could I pull off
hiring a hit man

11:34.383 --> 11:35.382
from solitary confinement,

11:35.415 --> 11:37.919
- Lieutenant?
- Captain.

11:37.952 --> 11:38.918
Right.

11:38.951 --> 11:40.583
Captain.

11:40.624 --> 11:44.085
You were on the news...
about that ordeal at the wall.

11:44.126 --> 11:46.091
I came out of that all right.

11:46.124 --> 11:48.520
I'm surprised you're not
more highly ranked

11:48.553 --> 11:50.623
for a woman your age.

11:50.656 --> 11:53.156
I-I bet you have one of those
plaques hanging on your wall

11:53.189 --> 11:55.058
just to show everyone
how far you've come

11:55.091 --> 11:57.024
in such a short amount of time.

11:59.792 --> 12:01.092
No ring.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.924
Been single a long time,
haven't you?

12:04.957 --> 12:07.692
You don't know anything
about me.

12:07.732 --> 12:10.229
I know that you don't
like me because...

12:10.270 --> 12:12.067
people respect me.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.499
Because what I do
amounts to more

12:13.532 --> 12:15.097
than just buttoning up
a business suit

12:15.138 --> 12:17.336
and barking orders from a desk,

12:17.369 --> 12:20.701
hoping that people
will take me seriously.

12:20.734 --> 12:23.342
You think this far-fetched
scheme of yours

12:23.375 --> 12:26.373
to put me in jail
will make you feel important?

12:26.406 --> 12:29.077
Well, let me be
the first to tell you

12:29.110 --> 12:31.783
that you're not important.

12:33.648 --> 12:37.988
You'd be content if just
one person could see you

12:38.019 --> 12:39.881
and want you.

12:39.922 --> 12:42.519
But they don't, do they?

12:42.553 --> 12:46.885
All those men you work with,
they just walk right past you.

12:46.918 --> 12:50.493
Like you're invisible.

12:50.526 --> 12:52.426
No matter what you do,

12:52.460 --> 12:55.093
no matter how bad you want it,

12:55.126 --> 12:57.995
at the end of the day,
it'll always be just you.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.193
Alone.

13:03.602 --> 13:05.401
You're a son of a bitch.

13:06.603 --> 13:08.172
I know you killed
Dr. Fuller.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.412
I know you're behind the
murder of Haley Myers.

13:10.445 --> 13:14.211
And I am gonna
personally see to it

13:14.244 --> 13:17.115
that you never get on the other
side of the razor wire.

13:17.148 --> 13:20.649
I hope you get your man.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.549
Can you tell us what happened
when you were at the safe house?

13:24.582 --> 13:26.588
I was listening
to the testimony.

13:26.621 --> 13:29.319
I got up and went
to the bathroom.

13:29.352 --> 13:30.886
And then I heard a shot.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.820
And then another one.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.619
Did you ever get a look back
at who was shooting?

13:34.652 --> 13:36.122
No, the door was closed.

13:36.155 --> 13:38.091
I knew if I didn't do anything,
I'd be next,

13:38.124 --> 13:39.891
so I went to the window
and opened it.

13:39.924 --> 13:42.457
And that's when you climbed down.
Yes.

13:42.490 --> 13:43.888
And I just started running.

13:43.921 --> 13:45.992
Did you ever look back?
No.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.095
So you didn't see the shooter.

13:47.128 --> 13:48.159
No.

13:48.192 --> 13:49.832
But Haley did.

13:49.865 --> 13:51.065
Haley?

13:51.098 --> 13:52.433
The other witness.

13:52.466 --> 13:55.502
Haley told me
she saw the killer.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.367
You said you ran away after
the shots were fired, so...

13:58.408 --> 13:59.606
when did she tell you?

13:59.639 --> 14:01.468
About ten minutes ago.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.971
Um, sorry, I'm not
quite following you.

14:04.004 --> 14:05.907
I'm a medium psychic.

14:05.940 --> 14:09.242
But on good days,
I'm a petite psychic.

14:09.275 --> 14:10.546
(groans):
Oh.

14:10.579 --> 14:12.681
I can communicate
with her spirit.

14:12.714 --> 14:14.077
Miss Vaughn, we don't usually

14:14.110 --> 14:16.644
get our leads from spirits.

14:16.677 --> 14:18.716
We like to deal in facts.
Well, this is legit.

14:18.749 --> 14:20.779
I had the Cerebellux procedure.

14:20.820 --> 14:21.818
It worked on me.

14:21.851 --> 14:23.114
Cerebellux procedure?

14:23.147 --> 14:24.819
It's relatively
new and unproven.

14:24.852 --> 14:27.858
It's meant to increase
percentage of brain usage

14:27.891 --> 14:28.857
in human beings.

14:28.890 --> 14:30.011
Enhancements have been known

14:30.025 --> 14:31.760
to add sensory abilities

14:31.793 --> 14:33.725
or a notable increase
in intelligence.

14:33.758 --> 14:35.661
Maybe you should try it, John.

14:35.694 --> 14:37.327
MAYA: I was one of
the positive results.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.936
When I touch items,
like, anything, really,

14:40.969 --> 14:42.967
the voices start in my head.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.199
And if I'm holding an item
of a deceased person,

14:45.240 --> 14:46.536
well, then they

14:46.569 --> 14:48.304
just start talking
to me from the beyond.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.576
That's fascinating.

14:49.609 --> 14:50.775
That's insane.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.573
I'm sorry, sorry.

14:52.606 --> 14:53.813
You know what happens
when I get nervous.

14:53.846 --> 14:55.676
I just can't stop talking.

14:55.709 --> 14:56.708
Haley's upset.

14:56.749 --> 14:58.676
She wants me to get to the point

14:58.717 --> 14:59.981
and tell you who killed her.

15:00.012 --> 15:01.011
JOHN & DORIAN:
Who?

15:01.052 --> 15:02.818
Ethan Avery.

15:02.851 --> 15:04.181
Ethan Avery?

15:05.148 --> 15:07.713
Uh, Miss Vaughn...

15:07.746 --> 15:09.881
Ethan Avery was sitting
in a courtroom across town...

15:09.914 --> 15:11.418
(groaning)

15:11.451 --> 15:13.320
Could you please
lower your voice?

15:13.353 --> 15:17.054
Sorry, she really
needs you to listen.

15:17.087 --> 15:18.887
Ethan Avery murdered her.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.760
She knows it for sure.

15:20.793 --> 15:22.859
She saw his face.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.563
Okay, uh...

15:24.596 --> 15:25.635
Thanks, Maya.

15:25.668 --> 15:26.867
Haley.

15:26.901 --> 15:29.804
We'll be right back.

15:29.837 --> 15:31.971
Medium. DORIAN:
Psychic-medium, actually.

15:32.004 --> 15:33.675
She's a kook.
She says that Ethan Avery

15:33.708 --> 15:35.937
is the one that killed
Haley Myers in the safe house.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.258
Ethan Avery was
with me in court.

15:37.275 --> 15:38.578
It's impossible.

15:38.611 --> 15:40.410
That's what I said.
Look, I think

15:40.443 --> 15:42.479
the real problem here is the
D.A.'s last living witness

15:42.512 --> 15:43.846
belongs in a puzzle factory,

15:43.879 --> 15:45.911
not giving testimony
on a witness stand.

15:45.952 --> 15:48.150
Hello, my fellow law enforcers.

15:48.183 --> 15:49.414
Sorry to interrupt.

15:49.455 --> 15:50.980
But I thought you might
like to hear this.

15:51.021 --> 15:53.785
We all know that facial
replication technology exists,

15:53.818 --> 15:56.551
DNA can be fabricated,
fingerprints can be planted.

15:56.584 --> 15:59.022
The human vocal chords
can't be faked.

15:59.055 --> 16:01.285
Recorded, yes.
Duplicated, yes.

16:01.318 --> 16:03.621
And to the human ear,
they can seem identical.

16:03.654 --> 16:05.860
However, if an
auditory specialist,

16:05.893 --> 16:08.456
like <i>moi,</i> tirelessly analyzes

16:08.489 --> 16:11.191
the audio print, it is possible

16:11.224 --> 16:12.925
to discern
whether or not a voice

16:12.958 --> 16:14.757
is a recording or...

16:14.790 --> 16:15.893
as in this case,

16:15.926 --> 16:17.197
organic.

16:17.230 --> 16:18.567
- Anybody get that?
- I do.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.137
Thank you, my friend.

16:20.170 --> 16:21.536
I pulled some audio

16:21.569 --> 16:23.000
from the hologram testimony,

16:23.041 --> 16:24.576
and picked out a voice
from the safe house.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.774
The killer's voice.

16:26.807 --> 16:28.235
This voice.

16:28.276 --> 16:30.241
MAN:
Where's the other one?

16:30.274 --> 16:31.873
That voice is 100%
not a recording.

16:31.906 --> 16:35.042
Those are coming directly
from vocal chords.

16:35.075 --> 16:36.714
Which means that
whoever was saying this

16:36.747 --> 16:39.018
was actually in the room...

16:39.051 --> 16:40.618
with the witnesses

16:40.651 --> 16:42.217
and fired that gun.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.218
And the voice belongs to...

16:44.251 --> 16:45.689
wait for it...

16:46.857 --> 16:48.254
...Ethan Avery

16:48.287 --> 16:50.190
himself.

16:56.198 --> 16:58.144
What about an identical twin?

16:58.177 --> 16:59.741
That would explain why
someone with his voice

16:59.782 --> 17:01.717
killed the witness
and the bailiff.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.413
We checked that out.

17:03.446 --> 17:04.486
Avery's an only child.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.516
Narcissistic, sociopathic...

17:06.549 --> 17:08.188
But what's the ultimate
in narcissism?

17:08.221 --> 17:10.788
What if Avery cloned himself?

17:10.820 --> 17:12.788
No, we checked with the
Anti-Replication guys.

17:12.821 --> 17:14.797
They said there's no
case file on Avery.

17:14.829 --> 17:16.863
Oh, come on, those ARD guys
are so backlogged.

17:16.896 --> 17:18.232
I wouldn't trust their records.

17:18.265 --> 17:20.031
RUDY:
Hello, people...

17:20.071 --> 17:21.967
cloning is complex.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.673
Unless Avery had a secret
Ph.D in biogenetics,

17:24.705 --> 17:26.309
he wouldn't have the skills.

17:26.342 --> 17:28.140
We did a thorough
background check on Avery.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.338
If he was harboring a clone,
we would've found evidence.

17:30.371 --> 17:32.471
Wait a minute, Dr. Fuller's
a fertility specialist.

17:32.504 --> 17:34.836
I mean, we don't know
why Avery killed him,

17:34.869 --> 17:37.137
but cloning's
a reproductive technology.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.436
What if there's
a connection we missed?

17:39.469 --> 17:41.502
Right, we've never been able
to establish motive.

17:41.543 --> 17:44.276
Or any connection
between Avery and Fuller.

17:44.309 --> 17:46.707
Let's check it out.

17:51.516 --> 17:52.716
Hey.

17:52.749 --> 17:53.819
Uh, you sure you don't mind?

17:53.852 --> 17:55.249
Oh, no, it's fine.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.457
Here... this was hers.

17:59.182 --> 18:01.148
(Maya sighs quietly)

18:02.578 --> 18:04.478
I'm sorry.

18:04.511 --> 18:05.814
I'm not getting anything.

18:05.847 --> 18:08.053
How long ago did
your wife pass away?

18:08.086 --> 18:09.453
My ex-wife.

18:09.486 --> 18:11.086
I was just hoping she was dead.

18:11.119 --> 18:12.789
(laughter)

18:12.822 --> 18:14.187
I don't think
this is gonna work.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.418
Yeah, that's what she said.

18:15.451 --> 18:18.025
Wait, uh, what was that?

18:18.058 --> 18:20.518
That's Haley. She wants me
to deliver a message.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.421
What is it? What'd she say?

18:22.454 --> 18:23.861
The message isn't for you.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.191
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Liam Fuller.

18:27.224 --> 18:29.054
You knew him, didn't you?

18:29.087 --> 18:30.450
Yes.

18:30.491 --> 18:33.223
I read about his murder.

18:33.256 --> 18:34.591
It chilled me.

18:34.623 --> 18:36.423
Although I hadn't seen him
in many years.

18:36.456 --> 18:38.192
Actually, I found
an article by Dr. Fuller

18:38.225 --> 18:40.193
that was published 22 years ago

18:40.226 --> 18:42.664
on stem cell cloning.

18:43.526 --> 18:44.693
It mentions Adelaide Jones

18:44.726 --> 18:46.459
as his research assistant.

18:46.492 --> 18:48.497
That's you, right?

18:48.531 --> 18:49.678
That was Dr. Fuller
being generous.

18:49.702 --> 18:51.205
Did you stay in touch
with Dr. Fuller

18:51.238 --> 18:52.773
- after the study was over?
- No.

18:52.806 --> 18:55.014
When they passed
legislation banning cloning,

18:55.047 --> 18:57.677
research funding
dried up overnight.

18:57.710 --> 18:59.746
Dr. Fuller had
to give up that work

18:59.779 --> 19:01.376
and refocus his career.

19:01.409 --> 19:03.345
By any chance do you recall
an Ethan Avery

19:03.378 --> 19:04.585
taking part in that study?

19:04.618 --> 19:05.584
I wouldn't know.

19:05.617 --> 19:07.151
The subjects were anonymous.

19:07.184 --> 19:09.583
I've looked for more
of his work on cloning,

19:09.616 --> 19:11.085
but I haven't been able
to find anything.

19:11.118 --> 19:13.790
We worked a lot out
of his mother's house.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.892
If his old research
still exists,

19:15.925 --> 19:18.628
you might try looking there.

19:18.661 --> 19:20.395
Uh, have you seen Maya?

19:20.428 --> 19:21.362
Maya?

19:21.395 --> 19:22.962
- The witness?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.760
The one I asked you to watch?

19:24.793 --> 19:27.961
Yeah, look, she asked me to go
get her a cup of coffee.

19:28.002 --> 19:30.401
- I come back, I can't find her. - Paul, I
couldn't have given you an easier job.

19:30.434 --> 19:32.306
You think it's easy to take
care of bananapants all day?

19:32.339 --> 19:33.802
What are you doing?

19:33.843 --> 19:34.873
I'm checking the
surveillance cameras

19:34.906 --> 19:36.305
around the precinct.

19:36.338 --> 19:37.973
If she left, we should be
able to trace her...

19:38.007 --> 19:39.238
I've got her.

19:39.271 --> 19:40.638
She's walking down
Eighth Street.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.406
No, no, wait... why don't you

19:42.447 --> 19:45.043
just go re-read the <i>How</i>
<i>to Be a Cop</i> manual?

19:48.610 --> 19:49.481
(siren chirps)

19:49.514 --> 19:50.745
JOHN:
Hey, Maya.

19:51.914 --> 19:53.184
Nice day for a walk.

19:53.217 --> 19:55.480
I'm going to see
Haley's parents.

19:55.521 --> 19:56.919
She wants to talk to them.

19:56.952 --> 19:58.351
Did Haley ask you to do that?

19:58.384 --> 19:59.584
I have to give them a message.

19:59.622 --> 20:01.053
Tell them that she's okay.

20:01.086 --> 20:03.190
Haley is definitely not okay.

20:03.223 --> 20:05.156
Look, why don't you
hop in the back?

20:05.189 --> 20:07.091
You can either hop in the car

20:07.124 --> 20:08.523
or I'll arrest you
for jay-walking.

20:08.556 --> 20:10.394
Either way you're
coming with us.

20:18.403 --> 20:20.083
JOHN: <i>Why did you leave</i>
<i>the police station?</i>

20:20.108 --> 20:22.003
<i>What were you</i>
<i>possibly thinking?</i>

20:22.036 --> 20:24.275
I wasn't thinking,
I was listening.

20:24.308 --> 20:26.845
Something you could
probably learn to do.

20:26.876 --> 20:28.147
Tell me about it.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.180
We're doing our very best

20:29.212 --> 20:30.178
to try and protect you.

20:30.211 --> 20:31.648
And you're wandering around

20:31.681 --> 20:33.080
like a walking bull's-eye.

20:33.113 --> 20:34.351
You're in protective
custody for a reason.

20:34.385 --> 20:35.951
People are trying to kill you.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.348
John, has anyone ever told you
about your energy?

20:38.381 --> 20:39.418
I have.

20:39.451 --> 20:40.514
MAYA:
It's very troubling.

20:40.547 --> 20:42.114
You're surrounded by

20:42.155 --> 20:44.216
a very strong aura of red.

20:44.249 --> 20:46.519
"Strong aura of red."
Great.

20:46.552 --> 20:49.588
It's the color
of anger and frustration.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.018
And apples and Christmas.

20:51.051 --> 20:52.953
It pushes people away from you.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.723
I can tell that's not
what you want.

20:54.756 --> 20:57.755
You know, I kind of like
being by myself. Really?

20:57.796 --> 21:00.362
'Cause when we met, John,
I got a very intense vision.

21:00.395 --> 21:01.960
I'm getting an intense
vision right now.

21:01.993 --> 21:03.526
It was all dark.

21:03.559 --> 21:04.757
There was a bright light.

21:04.798 --> 21:05.963
And there was, um...

21:05.996 --> 21:07.993
- running.
- So, you're telling me

21:08.026 --> 21:09.698
to run towards the light?

21:09.731 --> 21:10.827
No, you're not running.

21:10.868 --> 21:12.196
Someone's coming towards you.

21:12.237 --> 21:14.664
Someone very special.

21:14.697 --> 21:15.967
It's also a very strong smell.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.431
DORIAN:
Is it New Spice Special Reserve?

21:17.464 --> 21:19.102
'Cause sometimes he wears
too much aftershave.

21:19.135 --> 21:20.468
- No, I don't.
- No, not that.

21:20.501 --> 21:21.467
Something else.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.634
Bourbon.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.401
Now you're talking.

21:24.434 --> 21:26.000
You on the other hand...

21:26.033 --> 21:27.335
when I read you,

21:27.368 --> 21:28.870
everything is quiet.

21:28.903 --> 21:30.736
Peaceful.

21:30.777 --> 21:31.976
See, now I know
you're way off base.

21:32.009 --> 21:33.879
'Cause this guy
is anything but.

21:33.912 --> 21:35.142
(tires screech)

21:36.911 --> 21:38.143
(gunfire)

21:38.184 --> 21:40.677
Get down!
Watch out! Watch out!

21:52.753 --> 21:54.288
I'm going out.

21:54.321 --> 21:56.161
But you can't!
You don't have a chestplate!

21:59.665 --> 22:01.800
Maya, no! John, she's hit!

22:03.466 --> 22:04.862
Eli!
(groans)

22:04.902 --> 22:06.703
Leave him! We got to get
the hell out of here!

22:15.735 --> 22:18.731
I need an ambulance... now!

22:25.535 --> 22:27.543
Ethan Avery...?!

22:34.231 --> 22:36.995
We got a lead on who killed
Haley Myers in the safe house.

22:37.028 --> 22:37.963
MALDONADO:
Who?

22:37.996 --> 22:39.637
Ethan Avery's clone.

22:39.670 --> 22:41.175
He looks exactly like him,

22:41.208 --> 22:43.172
- ten years younger.
- What about the others?

22:43.205 --> 22:45.602
I don't know. I didn't get
a look at their faces, but...

22:45.635 --> 22:48.307
if I had to guess,
I'd say they were clones, too.

22:48.340 --> 22:51.241
They're well-trained,
well-armed, and proficient.

22:51.274 --> 22:53.913
Stahl's gone to Fuller's mother
to track down his research.

22:53.946 --> 22:55.417
Have you heard
from the hospital?

22:55.450 --> 22:56.987
Yeah.
Maya's got a chipped collarbone

22:57.020 --> 22:59.053
and possible internal bleeding.

22:59.086 --> 23:02.662
That's not good news.
How the hell did they find her?

23:02.695 --> 23:04.094
I have no idea.

23:04.127 --> 23:05.601
We weren't
at a predetermined location.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.632
Stahl checked
the precinct surveillance.

23:07.665 --> 23:09.399
She wasn't followed
when she left.

23:09.432 --> 23:12.439
We're sweeping the cruiser
for tracking devices.

23:12.472 --> 23:14.039
She has to pull through.

23:14.072 --> 23:15.806
If we don't have her,
we have nothing on Avery.

23:15.839 --> 23:17.475
We can't connect her to Fuller.

23:17.508 --> 23:19.444
I know.

23:19.478 --> 23:21.444
He's winning.

23:21.477 --> 23:22.875
Avery's winning.

23:22.908 --> 23:25.173
I'll call you
if I get anything else.

23:53.588 --> 23:56.121
(gasps)

23:56.154 --> 23:58.415
Try not to move too much.

24:02.151 --> 24:05.043
Is Detective Kennex okay?

24:05.084 --> 24:07.051
He's fine. He's looking
for the shooters right now.

24:07.084 --> 24:08.785
We're all just glad you're okay.

24:08.818 --> 24:11.118
The bullet's impact
was 37 millimeters

24:11.150 --> 24:13.011
from puncturing your lung.

24:13.044 --> 24:15.946
You were very lucky, Maya.

24:15.979 --> 24:20.352
I don't think anyone's
ever called me that before.

24:20.385 --> 24:22.983
I never thought of myself as

24:23.024 --> 24:23.950
lucky.

24:23.983 --> 24:25.988
Why is that?

24:29.858 --> 24:31.824
The week before
my 19th birthday,

24:31.857 --> 24:34.190
my parents died
in a car accident.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.989
The police said it was instant.

24:38.324 --> 24:39.659
I'm-I'm sorry.

24:41.325 --> 24:42.795
That's okay.

24:42.828 --> 24:45.823
We all know that
we're gonna lose our parents.

24:45.864 --> 24:48.356
I just assumed
it would be years later.

24:48.397 --> 24:52.993
Definitely not both of them
at the same time.

24:53.026 --> 24:54.993
Everyone said,
"With time, it'll get better."

24:55.034 --> 24:57.098
And I tried,

24:57.131 --> 25:00.874
but I was living in the house
that I grew up in.

25:00.907 --> 25:04.239
I didn't want to move.
It was my home.

25:04.272 --> 25:07.375
That's why you got
the procedure.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.145
I heard it helped people
connect to the other side.

25:13.186 --> 25:15.818
Everyone told me not to do it,
that it was a fraud,

25:15.851 --> 25:20.122
that hearing voices was a sign
of mental illness,

25:20.154 --> 25:21.858
but I didn't care.

25:21.891 --> 25:25.025
I signed up right away,
followed all the rules,

25:25.058 --> 25:27.499
did everything they suggested.

25:27.532 --> 25:31.600
And then when I woke up...

25:31.633 --> 25:33.905
I knew something was different.

25:36.106 --> 25:38.840
When I heard the first voice,
I was terrified. (Laughs)

25:38.873 --> 25:40.871
It was so clear...

25:40.912 --> 25:45.141
and no one else could hear it.

25:45.174 --> 25:49.717
When the shock wore off,
I knew I had the ability.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.254
That must've been amazing.

25:53.624 --> 25:56.456
Realizing you could reconnect
with your parents.

25:56.489 --> 25:59.425
That's what I thought.

26:00.795 --> 26:04.064
While I was recovering
from the procedure,

26:04.097 --> 26:06.629
there was a fire.

26:06.669 --> 26:10.034
Our house burnt to the ground.

26:10.067 --> 26:12.002
(sniffles)

26:12.035 --> 26:14.672
And when I went back,
it was just ash.

26:14.705 --> 26:17.702
(voice breaking): And I needed
something of theirs to touch,

26:17.735 --> 26:20.009
to connect to them.

26:20.042 --> 26:23.040
But everything...

26:23.081 --> 26:25.375
everything was gone.

26:31.010 --> 26:34.249
The irony is, I talk
to dead people all the time.

26:34.282 --> 26:36.049
(chuckles)

26:36.082 --> 26:39.882
But I can't talk to the people
who matter the most to me.

26:51.323 --> 26:53.091
What'd you find?

26:53.132 --> 26:54.963
There are no trackers,
Detective.

26:54.996 --> 26:56.467
Your vehicle is clean.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.899
I want you to turn

26:57.932 --> 27:00.264
this phone into
a secure comm, okay?

27:00.297 --> 27:01.703
Completely off police channels.

27:01.736 --> 27:05.394
Certainly. One moment.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.603
(comm ringing)

27:13.003 --> 27:15.708
Ooh, a secure line.
What's the occasion?

27:15.741 --> 27:18.976
Rudy, did Valerie deliver the MX
destroyed at the safe house?

27:19.009 --> 27:20.974
Ah, yes, Detective Stahl,

27:21.007 --> 27:23.109
she graced the lab
with her presence.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.078
Check the MX's comm tech.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.615
See if it's missing.

27:26.648 --> 27:28.181
Okay.

27:28.214 --> 27:31.115
It's not there.

27:33.018 --> 27:36.120
In fact,
the whole ear is missing.

27:36.153 --> 27:37.951
That's how they did it.

27:37.984 --> 27:40.916
That's how they followed Maya.
They stole it,

27:40.957 --> 27:43.958
and they're monitoring
police comm signals.

27:51.964 --> 27:52.930
Hello?

27:54.433 --> 27:55.896
We should take a look inside.

27:55.929 --> 27:57.770
Do we have probable cause,
Detective Stahl?

27:57.803 --> 28:00.171
Yes. I'm worried
about Mrs. Fuller's health.

28:00.204 --> 28:02.108
She's an old lady.

28:02.141 --> 28:05.446
No problem. I'll notify
the precinct of our location.

28:06.847 --> 28:09.182
(device whirs, lock clicks)

28:13.887 --> 28:16.021
Anybody home?

28:19.525 --> 28:21.429
Mrs. Fuller?

28:23.503 --> 28:24.934
Clear the upstairs.

28:38.554 --> 28:41.184
(device trills)

29:04.410 --> 29:06.482
(drawers open)

29:25.960 --> 29:27.199
The second floor is clear.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.735
Send this and all the files

29:28.768 --> 29:30.830
on this computer to
Maldonado immediately.

29:30.871 --> 29:33.165
Copy.

29:58.085 --> 29:59.884
(thud)

29:59.917 --> 30:01.419
(gun cocks)

30:12.109 --> 30:14.347
Stop right there.

30:22.316 --> 30:24.976
All police frequencies have been
compromised. We have to assume

30:24.994 --> 30:27.589
that Avery's clones have heard
everything we've broadcast.

30:27.622 --> 30:29.382
Dr. Lom is setting up
an encrypted frequency.

30:29.391 --> 30:31.263
Should be up and running
in 15 minutes.

30:31.296 --> 30:35.097
Captain, this was sent by Detective
Stahl via her MX. She marked it urgent.

30:35.130 --> 30:36.897
She found the connection.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.899
Dr. Fuller was the one
who cloned Avery.

30:38.932 --> 30:39.971
How do you know?

30:40.004 --> 30:41.085
This is a letter Dr. Fuller

30:41.101 --> 30:43.141
sent to him, threatening
to publish his research

30:43.174 --> 30:46.142
and expose the clones.
That's why Avery killed him.

30:46.175 --> 30:49.279
Wait a minute. Valerie sent that
on the compromised frequency.

30:49.312 --> 30:50.280
What's her status?

30:50.320 --> 30:52.318
Detective Stahl logged in

30:52.351 --> 30:54.255
in a farmhouse
on Old Sawmill Road.

30:54.288 --> 30:56.120
The locator in her
cruiser indicates

30:56.153 --> 30:57.423
it was parked out front.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.893
(phone rings) It's Stahl.

30:59.926 --> 31:02.060
Valerie, listen to me.
You got to get out of there.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.765
MAN: You must be
someone very special.

31:04.798 --> 31:06.030
Who is this?

31:06.063 --> 31:07.599
I think you know.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.103
Of all the people she could

31:09.137 --> 31:12.236
have contacted when her life
depended on it, she chose you,

31:12.269 --> 31:14.035
Detective Kennex.

31:14.068 --> 31:16.634
Let me speak to Detective Stahl.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.305
That's not the way this works.

31:18.336 --> 31:20.803
You have someone I want,
and clearly we have someone

31:20.836 --> 31:22.768
you want, so let's see how
we can accommodate each other.

31:22.801 --> 31:25.902
You listen to me,
you hurt her in any way...

31:25.935 --> 31:28.468
I suggest <i>you</i> listen, Detective.

31:28.502 --> 31:31.035
I'm going to send you
a set of coordinates.

31:31.068 --> 31:32.903
I want Ethan Avery brought

31:32.936 --> 31:34.605
to that location in two hours.

31:34.638 --> 31:36.070
You will come in one car.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.271
If you bring reinforcements,
we will know.

31:38.304 --> 31:40.741
If there are drones in the area,
we will know.

31:40.774 --> 31:44.106
If we detect anything amiss,
she's dead.

31:44.139 --> 31:46.544
And don't even try
coming to this house.

31:46.577 --> 31:48.912
I know you know where we are.

31:48.945 --> 31:50.815
Wow, you must be the smart one.

31:50.848 --> 31:53.047
We <i>all</i> are.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.918
You have two hours.

31:54.951 --> 31:58.181
They won't negotiate with you...

31:58.222 --> 32:00.622
not even for me.

32:00.655 --> 32:02.326
You're not gonna get
what you want.

32:02.359 --> 32:03.958
I beg to differ.

32:03.991 --> 32:06.029
You should've heard him
on the phone.

32:06.062 --> 32:08.158
You're important to him.

32:08.199 --> 32:10.060
I say we kill her anyway!

32:10.093 --> 32:11.161
They shot Eli!

32:11.195 --> 32:13.832
And they'll pay for it,
but not right now.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.266
We have to get Ethan back.

32:15.303 --> 32:18.001
We have to put
the family back together.

32:18.034 --> 32:20.570
You're not a family.

32:20.603 --> 32:22.274
Why do this for a murderer

32:22.308 --> 32:24.341
who's held you hostage
your entire life?

32:26.679 --> 32:28.320
Because he is us.

32:29.490 --> 32:32.558
How far would you go

32:32.598 --> 32:34.764
to save yourself?

32:37.199 --> 32:39.301
They want to meet in the
woods north of the city.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.038
There's a road at each end.

32:41.071 --> 32:43.672
PAUL: What about aerial
surveillance? Maybe helos?

32:43.705 --> 32:46.648
These guys have tech
capable of spotting our assets.

32:46.681 --> 32:49.177
You can't seriously be thinking
about taking Avery out there.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.249
Paul, if we don't comply,
they won't hesitate.

32:51.282 --> 32:54.325
They'll kill her.

32:54.358 --> 32:57.197
Check out a transport vehicle
from the motor pool.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.567
I'll prep Avery for travel.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.199
Captain, you can't just give in.

33:03.072 --> 33:04.704
This is my case.

33:04.737 --> 33:06.472
We're gonna do it my way.

33:07.673 --> 33:10.238
Call Rudy.
We're gonna need his help.

33:14.384 --> 33:17.080
AVERY:
<i>Scanning me for weapons,</i>

33:17.120 --> 33:19.414
Captain Maldonado?
What's the occasion?

33:19.448 --> 33:21.851
It's standard procedure.
You're being released.

33:21.884 --> 33:23.218
Released?

33:23.251 --> 33:26.122
Please tell me
you finally got your man.

33:26.156 --> 33:28.689
Enjoy your freedom.

33:28.722 --> 33:30.690
It'll be short-lived, I promise.

33:30.723 --> 33:32.597
He's clean.
Thank you.

33:35.466 --> 33:37.792
Have transport standing by.

33:37.833 --> 33:39.800
Mr. Avery's ready for release.

33:39.833 --> 33:41.934
You must have a guardian angel.

33:43.030 --> 33:45.595
Get her in the van.

34:00.347 --> 34:01.946
(engine winds down)

34:16.335 --> 34:17.998
All right.

34:18.039 --> 34:20.702
Everyone's in position.
Let's get started.

34:25.579 --> 34:28.114
Calibrating scanners.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.518
Linking scanners
with our GPS coordinates.

34:35.887 --> 34:37.717
No drones. We're good.

34:37.759 --> 34:39.487
Get set up.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.295
And scanners are locked on.

34:43.328 --> 34:45.831
All right, let's get 'em.

34:50.766 --> 34:52.237
Bring her out!

34:55.741 --> 34:57.907
Get your hands off me.

35:02.578 --> 35:04.113
You set?

35:04.146 --> 35:06.677
Initializing
hologram projection.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.385
It's him.

35:32.374 --> 35:33.974
I've got to admit,
it shows some

35:34.007 --> 35:36.844
real spine on your part,
coming down here in person

35:36.877 --> 35:38.244
just to let me go.

35:38.277 --> 35:40.613
Your clones put us
in a tight spot.

35:40.646 --> 35:43.317
They are remarkable,
aren't they?

35:43.350 --> 35:46.053
Yeah, that's one word for it.

35:46.086 --> 35:48.720
Slight problem. We're getting
short on the hallway.

35:48.761 --> 35:50.790
This needs to happen fast.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.729
Do you really think,
after this is over,

35:56.770 --> 35:58.735
you can all just disappear?

35:58.768 --> 36:00.632
I kept them hidden
for over two decades,

36:00.672 --> 36:02.937
I'm sure we can disappear
for a few more.

36:02.970 --> 36:04.442
Okay, Rudy, how we looking?

36:04.475 --> 36:07.145
Not so good.
About 20 feet at most.

36:31.476 --> 36:32.681
It's not him!

36:32.715 --> 36:34.176
Stahl!

36:34.209 --> 36:35.849
(gunshots)

36:36.851 --> 36:38.516
What's up?

37:01.641 --> 37:04.469
Did Dorian just flip that van?

37:09.582 --> 37:11.579
Why hasn't he done that before?

37:13.516 --> 37:15.253
You okay?

37:15.286 --> 37:18.390
Yeah, I'm okay.

37:22.658 --> 37:25.055
- We got Stahl.
- Copy that.

37:28.222 --> 37:29.356
What the hell's going on?

37:29.389 --> 37:31.092
Why am I not being released?

37:35.027 --> 37:38.759
You're not going anywhere,
you son of a bitch.

37:41.198 --> 37:44.900
When I stepped into
the garage, I saw a man.

37:44.933 --> 37:47.867
He was walking towards
a parked car, carrying a gun.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.033
And then what?

37:49.066 --> 37:52.501
I saw the man shoot Dr. Fuller
three times.

37:52.534 --> 37:55.298
ORTEGA: And without any
doubt, can you see the man

37:55.331 --> 37:56.361
who pulled the trigger

37:56.402 --> 37:58.369
in the courtroom today?

37:58.402 --> 37:59.866
Yes, I do.

37:59.899 --> 38:01.602
Can you point to him, please?

38:02.539 --> 38:04.273
That man right there.

38:04.306 --> 38:06.506
ORTEGA: Let the record
show that the witness

38:06.539 --> 38:09.038
identified the defendant,
Ethan Avery.

38:09.071 --> 38:10.437
Thank you, Miss Vaughn.

38:10.478 --> 38:12.048
Your Honor, the State rests.

38:12.065 --> 38:14.896
Court will adjourn. We will
resume again in one hour.

38:21.534 --> 38:23.771
I got to say, you held
yourself together

38:23.804 --> 38:24.906
really well up there today.

38:24.939 --> 38:28.104
Really? I was so nervous,
I was shaking like a leaf.

38:28.137 --> 38:29.736
JOHN: Well, you
didn't look nervous.

38:29.778 --> 38:31.113
You did great.

38:31.146 --> 38:33.243
Listen, I know
you're a skeptic,

38:33.284 --> 38:35.916
but remember the energy
I was telling you about

38:35.949 --> 38:37.316
the other day in the car?

38:37.349 --> 38:38.420
Yeah, the, uh,

38:38.453 --> 38:40.822
the red one that repels
anything and everyone around me,

38:40.855 --> 38:43.093
except for bourbon and someone
coming towards me, right?

38:43.126 --> 38:44.493
Mm, that one.

38:44.526 --> 38:46.125
Just so you know,

38:46.166 --> 38:50.101
the universe has a way
of working things out for us.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.775
MALDONADO: All the wonderful
things you've done,

38:58.808 --> 39:01.017
it's already being erased.

39:01.050 --> 39:03.112
I think we both know
where this is going,

39:03.152 --> 39:05.688
so I wanted to be
the first to tell you

39:05.721 --> 39:08.584
that you're going
to jail forever.

39:08.625 --> 39:11.456
In the next few days, people
will be talking about you,

39:11.489 --> 39:16.732
about the killer, the cloner,
the novelty that is Ethan Avery.

39:16.765 --> 39:20.035
In a few years, people will
bring up in passing

39:20.068 --> 39:22.602
the egomaniacal philanthropist

39:22.635 --> 39:25.009
who made duplicates of himself
because he thought

39:25.042 --> 39:27.042
the world needed more of him.

39:29.112 --> 39:30.574
And decades and decades
from now,

39:30.607 --> 39:33.109
while you're in jail
rotting away alone,

39:33.143 --> 39:36.916
Ethan Avery will be forgotten.

39:36.949 --> 39:40.117
It will be like
you never existed.

39:43.592 --> 39:45.486
Hey, Sandra.

39:45.527 --> 39:46.422
Yeah?

39:46.455 --> 39:48.328
Oh, nothing.
I just wanted to say,

39:48.361 --> 39:50.633
uh, just wanted to say
you look nice today.

39:52.736 --> 39:54.166
Thanks.

40:01.746 --> 40:03.377
Hey, Dorian.

40:03.410 --> 40:05.818
Hey. I wanted to catch you
before you left the courthouse.

40:05.851 --> 40:07.217
I wanted to give this to you.

40:07.250 --> 40:08.513
What is it?

40:12.553 --> 40:15.152
I've been thinking about
your parents, what happened.

40:15.193 --> 40:17.656
I thought I'd look into it.

40:17.688 --> 40:19.623
There was an arson
investigation.

40:19.656 --> 40:22.798
Yeah, they never figured out
who did it.

40:22.831 --> 40:25.429
I know, but this box
was in the evidence locker,

40:25.462 --> 40:27.998
and I had it released.

40:28.031 --> 40:31.271
Maybe there's something in here
that might work for you.

40:33.072 --> 40:35.340
I hope it helps.

40:41.675 --> 40:43.778
(sighs deeply)

41:13.957 --> 41:16.324
(laughing)

41:22.265 --> 41:24.466
Hi!

41:45.155 --> 41:46.826
Want some company?

41:46.859 --> 41:49.362
Yeah, sure.

41:49.396 --> 41:51.300
Where'd you get the booze from?

41:51.333 --> 41:52.763
My desk, top drawer.

41:52.796 --> 41:54.435
Never know when
you're gonna need it.

41:54.468 --> 41:58.139
Boy, you really are
full of surprises.

41:58.172 --> 42:00.307
(chuckles)

42:01.507 --> 42:03.409
What are you doing
in here this late?

42:03.442 --> 42:05.276
Had to log some evidence
downstairs.

42:05.317 --> 42:06.683
What's your excuse?

42:06.716 --> 42:08.483
Ah, I was just
finishing off a report.

42:08.516 --> 42:11.386
Thought I'd catch
the second half of the game.

42:14.221 --> 42:16.157
Bourbon.

42:16.190 --> 42:18.292
Yeah, is that okay?

42:19.428 --> 42:22.729
"People running..."

42:22.762 --> 42:26.162
Yeah, it's soccer.

42:29.601 --> 42:31.304
You okay?

42:33.535 --> 42:34.839
Yeah.

42:39.638 --> 42:40.876
Cheers.

42:40.909 --> 42:42.845
Cheers, Detective.
