WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.840
One, two...

00:08.880 --> 00:11.600
You don't care who you betray,
you are rotten to the core.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.640
God's sake, Eve,
we both want the same thing,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.280
I'm just doing
a much better job.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.880
You can't just walk away.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.600
<i>I have a lot of stuff</i> <i>
to deal with.</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:20.800
<i>I hear Villanelle</i> <i>
had a lucky escape.</i>

00:20.840 --> 00:22.080
Surprise!

00:23.600 --> 00:25.560
This is the life
you're signing up for.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.160
<i>Usually people</i> <i>
have no other chance...</i>

00:28.200 --> 00:29.760
<i>Or options.</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:31.080
Hey.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.560
My back hurts.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.280
<i>I'm not like the other one.</i>

00:35.320 --> 00:36.680
<i>I need a name.</i>

00:36.720 --> 00:37.960
You should really
lock your door.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.600
Eve, don't.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.760
<i>Well done...</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:43.200
<i>You've killed one.</i>

00:43.240 --> 00:46.240
<i>They'll just replace him.</i> <i>
Over...</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:48.000
<i>And over.</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:49.760
Can I stay here?

00:49.800 --> 00:50.600
<i>And over.</i>

02:48.440 --> 02:49.600
Come...

03:01.440 --> 03:05.000
He's been killing my fish,
trespassing on my shores.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.160
What are you going
to do to him?

03:11.080 --> 03:12.200
Fillet him.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.080
I'm going on a hunt.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.560
I'm coming with you.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.760
Bagels!

04:58.800 --> 05:01.200
Oh, thanks.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.800
Hey, can I not be
on personal detail?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.320
- I'm better at logistics.
- Yes, sorry, mate.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.640
It's just Grace was busy
and the client asked
for a woman. So...

05:16.960 --> 05:19.160
In other news...

05:21.440 --> 05:24.040
Officially unlocked
by unofficial means.

05:26.240 --> 05:29.280
You don't need this, you know.
You completed the mission.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.480
And now that Helene's dead,
now what?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.840
Now you have to find
a new ordinary.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.320
The old one is not gonna fit.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.360
Hey. What was
the last really fun

05:49.400 --> 05:51.160
but very legal thing
that you did?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.600
- I can't remember.
- Well, you're in luck,

05:55.640 --> 05:57.960
because I put the "F" in fun.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.320
That was terrible!

06:01.360 --> 06:03.960
Yeah, I know.
It starts like this
and you need rhythm.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.120
You also need vocals

06:06.160 --> 06:08.000
and you need to be able
to make choices.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.440
And hold microphones
and be in dark rooms

06:10.480 --> 06:12.480
with weird lights,
and I need you to get changed
so I can take you--

06:12.520 --> 06:14.280
- OK, I'm changing then.
- Yes, please.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.480
I'd better eat the bagel first!

06:16.520 --> 06:18.400
Outside! Ten.
Something sparkly.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.320
All right.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.240
Still warm.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.880
How long will it take?

06:30.920 --> 06:33.200
Maybe ten minutes.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.960
Maybe ten hours.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.920
This way.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.480
This is going on forever.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.000
OK, well, if you're
gonna bow out,
if you're gonna bow out...

07:04.040 --> 07:05.880
Then you're gonna have
to take a solo

07:05.920 --> 07:07.560
and I'm hitting you
with a solo.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.680
Three, two, one.
It's you, go!

07:12.360 --> 07:15.080
Oh, this is so hard,
this is a very difficult song!

07:15.120 --> 07:16.520
But you're a very good singer.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.080

09:13.160 --> 09:16.120
I, erm...
I think, erm...

09:16.160 --> 09:17.720
Eve?

09:17.760 --> 09:19.920
I think I made a mistake.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.440
OK, about what?

09:21.480 --> 09:24.000
About all of it,
I mean, I can't stop thinking

09:24.040 --> 09:27.560
what if...
what if it was all a mistake?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.920
Don't torture yourself like
that. It's gonna get easier.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.760
Oh, please... Hey! I promise.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.800
Eve, you've got to find
the parts of your life

09:33.840 --> 09:36.680
that you can bear and just...
just live, from there.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.800
What? With three songs
and protein shakes?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.680
My last tour was hard.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.880
Seven of us made it back.
There's three left.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.520
What I mean is...
moving on,

09:57.560 --> 10:00.440
no matter how difficult,
that is always a choice.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.160
Well, what if I can't move on?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.000
You can, you can.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.760
But what if I don't want to?

10:10.640 --> 10:13.080
Well, that's a question
you need to answer.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.800
And I can't help you.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.880
I thought I could
but I can't,

10:18.920 --> 10:20.680
I've gotta get out of the way.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.440
Whatever you do next,
you can choose...

10:31.280 --> 10:33.000
You can.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.720
Look at that lovely stupid face.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.080
Take care, Eve.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.880
I don't want a life insurance,
I never had a PPI,

11:27.920 --> 11:31.800
and I'm not interested
in double glazing!

11:31.840 --> 11:33.120
Screw you.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.640
Irina?

11:36.680 --> 11:39.440
<i>I'm free,</i> <i>
your boss got me out.</i>

11:39.480 --> 11:40.680
Helene?

11:42.920 --> 11:47.280
Whatever you think,
you are not free.

11:47.320 --> 11:51.560
<i>What kind of dad lets</i> <i>
his daughter rot in hospital?</i>

11:52.360 --> 11:54.880
I was trying to help you.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.560
<i>Maybe if you had done</i> <i>
that earlier</i>

11:57.600 --> 11:59.320
<i>instead of helping shithead...</i>

11:59.920 --> 12:02.680
Who, Villanelle?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.040
<i>Of course, Villanelle.</i>

12:04.080 --> 12:06.320
<i>But, hey, maybe if I work</i> <i>
for The Twelve,</i>

12:06.360 --> 12:08.160
<i>you'll finally</i> <i>
pay attention to me.</i>

12:08.200 --> 12:09.600
Tell me where you are.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.760
Irina, tell me where you are!

12:12.800 --> 12:15.560
<i>You know I can't tell you.</i> <i>
They're the rules, old man.</i>

12:38.600 --> 12:40.320
I hope you don't mind
the intrusion,

12:40.360 --> 12:43.440
but I bought us both
an aperitif.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.400
Sod it, I'm on holiday.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.880
Ah. Beautiful creatures.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.720
I don't know what retirement
would have looked like

12:53.760 --> 12:55.680
had I not found birds.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.680
You'd have worn
less beige, I imagine?

12:57.720 --> 13:00.560
It's ghastly, isn't it?

13:00.600 --> 13:03.560
Well, fond
of the Barn Swallow too?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.640
I'm more of
a giraffe person myself.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.080
It's an incredible feeling.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.080
Being inches from the thing
you've been looking for.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.200
Remarkable.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.800
Carolyn.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.280
Shall we order lunch?

13:37.320 --> 13:39.040
I hear
the Wiener schnitzel's good.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.720
What's wrong with you?

13:46.680 --> 13:48.720
- Fine.
- You don't look fine.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.720
You look like
Angry Santa Claus.

13:50.760 --> 13:54.000
You here to work
or give me grief?

13:55.240 --> 13:58.400
Hmm, bit of both.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.800
I got you hot chocolate.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.640
Thanks.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.760
So... what's
on the schedule today?

14:19.160 --> 14:21.320
Who do I have to kill
to get a smile out of you?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.880
Look around you, Pam.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.200
Forget training today,

14:28.240 --> 14:30.760
you are young,
go have fun.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.800
I call you.

14:49.560 --> 14:53.040
So, you've come to drag
the rat back to Russia
by the tail?

14:53.080 --> 14:55.920
You've left a wake
of betrayal behind you, Carolyn.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.680
Russia. Me.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.640
Even your own country.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.880
Now you're completely alone.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.440
Wasting good sherry...
unlike you.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.080
Be my guest.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.840
On second thoughts,
I wouldn't if I were you.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.960
It was bought for me by that
beige creature in the lobby.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.800
I suspect he's an assassin
sent to kill me.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.920
Still, I don't want
to spoil your fun.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.440
And why would that be?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.320
In my absence...

15:34.360 --> 15:39.200
I found out why The Twelve
are such a pain
in the posterior to unearth.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.120
As you probably know,
The Twelve operates in cells,

15:42.160 --> 15:45.560
and those cells are kept
entirely separate
from each other.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.920
However, I found out
from this

15:47.960 --> 15:49.440
that the leadership do meet
on occasion.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.280
One of whom is Lars Meier.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.840
Who is?

15:54.600 --> 15:56.720
Someone from my past.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.080
When I looked into everyone
I had met when The Twelve
first bleeped on my radar,

16:00.120 --> 16:02.320
all of them were either dead
or clearly civilian.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.720
And Lars Meier?

16:04.760 --> 16:07.920
- Recently deceased.
- Aha.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.840
So now you're stumped.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.400
Not quite.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.000
I found this on his body.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.320
It contains dates

16:16.360 --> 16:18.920
of what I believe to be
previous Twelve meetings.

16:19.760 --> 16:23.920
And then there's this...

16:23.960 --> 16:26.840
The Barn Swallow--
the national bird of Austria.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.680
Intricately drawn
next to dates,

16:29.720 --> 16:32.240
perhaps a favoured
meeting place?

16:32.280 --> 16:35.360
As you can see from
the incessant decor
of this place, it led me here.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.800
You always were the very best.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.000
They must have been drunk
when they fired you.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.080
Carolyn... Damn! This may not be the place.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.080
But surely that would be
too brazen.

16:50.120 --> 16:54.480
Carolyn, you know the weight
betrayal carries for my people.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.960
Hold that thought, Vlad,
you've just given me
some inspiration.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.280
My apologies, Vlad.
My suggestion is that

17:07.320 --> 17:09.840
I leave you
our anoraked friend

17:09.880 --> 17:13.120
to take back to Russia
in my place.

17:13.160 --> 17:16.080
I'm sure he's still
loitering around,
waiting to finish the job.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.320
Meanwhile, I'll make
my way back to London

17:19.360 --> 17:21.440
and face what
needs to be faced.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.840
What can you see?

17:49.880 --> 17:51.640
Hairy pigs.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.960
Wild boars.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.160
Is that what you shot me with?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.000
Shhh. Shhh.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.960
There's something better
over here, come.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.440
I might take a couple
of these if that's OK.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.080
Er, yeah, go ahead.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.640
Er, thanks for coming.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.240
It's fine, you helped me
in a time of need,

18:37.280 --> 18:41.080
it felt only right,
to return the favour.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.760
You said you needed help?

18:47.520 --> 18:48.640
Yeah...

18:50.760 --> 18:54.080
What does, erm,
help look like to you?

18:56.680 --> 18:58.440
Oh, I don't know.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.240
Everything I have
set out to do, I...

19:15.280 --> 19:17.320
Do you know
I used to be married?

19:17.360 --> 19:20.120
I used to play bridge.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.160
I used to sing karaoke...

19:26.880 --> 19:30.280
I just watched a woman
bleed to death,
and killed a man.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.120
Er, I can't er... Oh, don't, don't worry,

19:32.160 --> 19:33.960
he was awful.
Like, really awful.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.160
But see, I, erm...

19:40.280 --> 19:42.240
I wanted to...

19:42.280 --> 19:46.320
I wanted to kill him,
so I did.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.760
I wanted Villanelle gone
and now she's gone.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.720
And unbelievably, I survived.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.080
- Well done?
- For what?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.160
Hmm?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.120
For what?

20:06.920 --> 20:09.760
What does it matter if...

20:09.800 --> 20:12.280
if the cells keep dividing?
And it's endless?

20:14.120 --> 20:18.240
Eve, all we can do in life,

20:18.280 --> 20:22.240
is try to find some joy
in the little things.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.480
A glass of wine,

20:26.520 --> 20:31.640
the, erm, Archers on
while you do the washing up,

20:32.560 --> 20:34.880
doing a crossword puzzle

20:34.920 --> 20:38.320
with the most perfect
mechanical pencil.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.400
The point...

20:40.440 --> 20:43.280
the reason why we're here,
I think, is to know ourselves.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.040
But the most important thing
you can do right now...

20:48.280 --> 20:51.880
is go to the people
that love you,

20:51.920 --> 20:55.200
who understand you
and know your soul.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.080
I really like these
in my Cheerios.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.480
You're gonna need
a whole lot more.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.880
That woman cradling you
in Margate, who was she?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.280
Nobody.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.400
Nobody.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.320
You know,
people can rot you too.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.320
You got to cut the rot out
before it kills you.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.480
Pam!

22:31.080 --> 22:32.520
Hi. What's up?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.880
- Wanna hang out?
- I can't.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.320
Er, I've been promoted
from Waltzers to hog roast!

22:38.360 --> 22:40.960
Wow!
Are you serving, mate?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.520
Come round, come round,
come round.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.040
What can I get you, sir?

22:44.080 --> 22:45.560
- Double hoagie, please.
- OK.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.120
Er, whoa, no, no, no...

22:55.160 --> 22:57.280
What... Not like that, let me...

23:06.280 --> 23:07.880
How'd you do that?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.280
It's all about making
dead things look nice.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.360
Worms?

23:15.320 --> 23:17.280
- Worms?
- They are nutritious.

23:18.640 --> 23:19.640
I'm OK.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.000
Do you get lonely here?

23:29.560 --> 23:31.920
I've got my animals.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.320
Animals are good company.
Humans are... dreadful.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.840
That's fair.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.000
Drink?

23:41.240 --> 23:42.400
It's Moonshine.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.600
Why didn't you kill Helene
yourself?

24:05.640 --> 24:07.360
I wanted to see
what you would do.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.160
No. Why did you want her dead?

24:13.640 --> 24:15.560
When I was young,

24:15.600 --> 24:18.000
my entire village in France
was wiped out

24:18.040 --> 24:19.680
by a poisoned water source.

24:22.160 --> 24:25.360
My parents died. So, I left.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.720
I went to Paris.

24:31.760 --> 24:33.960
And I longed
for the country again.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.640
Animals, trees.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.400
Freedom.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.840
Helene offered me that.
And gave me this island.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.640
What, you got this island?

24:48.680 --> 24:50.280
Oh, yes.

24:52.560 --> 24:57.400
But I realised not long ago
that Helene was just using me.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.800
Hmm...

25:00.040 --> 25:02.120
Such a bitch,

25:02.160 --> 25:04.280
she was just
holding us back.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.160
Big bitch.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.080
What poisoned the water
in your village?

25:20.440 --> 25:23.520
About three gallons
of sodium cyanide.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.680
Wow.

25:38.760 --> 25:39.840
Nice.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.480
Sorry about your hand.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.400
What do you want, Eve?

26:36.680 --> 26:38.240
What is this?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.280
Where did you get that?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.520
It's Helene's.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.920
Long story.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.320
I swear to God, you women
will be the death of me.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.600
- Come in.
- Thanks.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.200
It's a picture of a bird.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.440
From whom?

27:06.720 --> 27:10.600
It's a postcard,
a method of communication.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.960
The Twelve has gone digital!

27:16.000 --> 27:17.840
So, they don't know
she's dead yet.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.480
Helene is dead?

27:22.840 --> 27:24.160
Very.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.720
So, erm, what does it mean?

27:26.760 --> 27:30.480
Is it, er, a location,
a person, er--

27:30.520 --> 27:33.480
No, no, this is not job.
This look like a meeting.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.880
You should find Villanelle.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.640
She can help you out with this.

27:41.440 --> 27:45.440
Before she was shot in the back
with an arrow,

27:45.480 --> 27:46.960
she came to me

27:47.000 --> 27:49.960
and I sent her
to another assassin
in Scotland.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.560
She doesn't want to see me.

28:02.840 --> 28:06.360
Whatever you're going
to do, Eve, don't do it alone.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.720
Same to you.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.680
Hm.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.520
- Oh. Thank you.
- It's OK. I...

28:31.360 --> 28:33.000
- There you go.
- Thanks.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.320
Oh. Thank you.

28:36.360 --> 28:40.800
I'll take the double hoggy,
extra pickles. And a Coke.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.880
Hi.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.080
You got a new job?

28:48.120 --> 28:50.840
No, just, helping out.

28:50.880 --> 28:54.280
Oh, what a shame.
You suit the little hat.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.480
- Mustard?
- Please.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.960
And to talk.
Somewhere private.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.040
Circumstances have changed,
but don't worry, it's all good.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.560
I can't.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.760
Keep it up, Pamster!

29:13.800 --> 29:16.040
Then come to the hotel later.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.600
Sorry. When I finish up
here, OK?

29:22.000 --> 29:23.600
Mmm...

29:25.120 --> 29:26.680
It's excellent by the way.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.520
The meat is so tender!

29:28.560 --> 29:30.360
Oh, thanks, man.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.720
Inverness...

31:24.600 --> 31:26.840
Pizza? Good.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.120
Is that my bag?

31:35.160 --> 31:37.520
- I packed for you.
- What for?

31:38.880 --> 31:40.320
We are leaving.

31:41.680 --> 31:42.760
I...

31:45.560 --> 31:48.480
We can't just leave.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.240
I've made plans
to keep you safe.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.040
I'll protect you.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.840
Why would you do this for me?

31:59.880 --> 32:04.000
Because The Twelve
will make you
do terrible things.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.320
You are so much better
than the life
that's planned for you.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.840
And if The Twelve find us,
they'll kill us.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.160
Ah, if we are lucky.
They'll make us suffer first.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.480
Hmm. A good plan, hm?

32:21.640 --> 32:24.040
They won't find us,
I promise.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.560
Come, let's eat.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.680
Are you scared to leave?

32:48.080 --> 32:50.320
I'm celebrating our adventure.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.320
Everyone I ever worked for
has been one step away
from killing me.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.240
Fear is in my blood.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.360
When I'm not scared,

33:08.400 --> 33:10.000
then I'm scared.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.360
I don't want
to live like that.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.000
I don't want you to either.

33:31.360 --> 33:34.320
I'll always be grateful to you
for helping me start a new life.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.960
Jesus!

33:50.840 --> 33:51.840
Helene?

33:52.360 --> 33:53.680
Yeah.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.200
She's dead, Pam.
You didn't have to do this.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.520
What... what...

34:04.760 --> 34:06.280
What did...
What did you do?

34:06.320 --> 34:08.720
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

34:08.760 --> 34:10.040
Oh, God. Please.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.680
I can stop the bleeding.
I can, I can stop the bleeding,

34:15.720 --> 34:18.040
I can... stop the bleeding.

34:24.680 --> 34:25.800
Stop.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.640
Stop.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.120
No...

34:32.160 --> 34:34.200
I have a letter in my bag.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.080
Bring it to Carolyn Martens
for me.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.160
And tell her...

34:43.200 --> 34:44.720
I always loved her.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.440
I'm <i>so</i> proud of you.

34:53.480 --> 34:54.880
Thank you.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.960
I'm sorry.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.720
- Is that my boat?
- Needed firewood.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.200
Er, where are my things?

37:39.600 --> 37:41.040
In my cabin.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.960
You sleep with me now.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.840
This is your new home, Villanelle.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.800
Ah.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.120
..moving away northwards.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.080
<i>The area forecasts</i> <i>
for the next 24 hours.</i>

38:02.120 --> 38:06.880
<i>Viking, North Utsire,</i> <i>
southwesterly veering</i> <i>
northwesterly 546.</i>

38:06.920 --> 38:09.080
<i>Rain at frst, later good.</i>

38:10.640 --> 38:14.320
<i>Forties, Cromarty, Forth,</i> <i>
Tyne, Dogger.</i>

38:14.360 --> 38:17.480
<i>West veering north</i> <i>
or northwest 546.</i>

38:17.520 --> 38:20.640
<i>Occasional rain, showers...</i>

38:52.440 --> 38:56.080
So, what happens to you,
now that Helene's dead?

38:56.120 --> 38:58.280
I'm working for The Twelve,
not Helene.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.120
Hmm.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.360
I'm leaving.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.800
Why?

39:04.840 --> 39:06.400
I'm done with them.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.960
I'm going to kill
as many of them as I can.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.160
They've got you in a cage.
You just can't see it.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.120
I value my freedom here
above all else

39:14.160 --> 39:15.600
and The Twelve grant me that.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.920
It comes at a price.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.400
- It's a small price.
- OK.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.040
I'm going to need my stuff.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.000
If you threaten
my way of life, Villanelle,

39:28.040 --> 39:30.840
I will rip you apart. Slowly.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.960
Your choice.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.880
If you can catch me.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.680
Ha ha!

39:40.440 --> 39:42.080
Oh, no...

40:05.920 --> 40:07.200
Villanelle...

40:12.800 --> 40:14.440
Villanelle!

40:31.960 --> 40:33.280
Oh...

40:51.560 --> 40:52.840
Oh!
