Yet 13 days into this game.
Monica, what's this going to do

29:04.977 --> 29:05.609
Monica, what's this going to do
to this group?

29:05.611 --> 29:07.778

29:07.780 --> 29:08.645

going on and who you can really

29:11.951 --> 29:13.150
Going on and who you can really
trust and where your loyalties

29:13.152 --> 29:13.617
Trust and where your loyalties
lie.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.085
Lie.
I think there's nothing wrong

29:15.087 --> 29:16.887
I think there's nothing wrong
with going the tribal council.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.089

29:32.104 --> 29:34.004
Wiglesworth and I battling to
see who goes home.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.840
See who goes home.
The four original bayon are

29:36.842 --> 29:38.342
The four original bayon are
still very strong, and that's a

29:38.344 --> 29:39.209
Still very strong, and that's a
tough nut to crack.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.912
Tough nut to crack.
I hope that at least some of the

29:41.914 --> 29:44.915
I hope that at least some of the
bonds I have stick.

30:05.303 --> 30:08.205
>> I'll say it once so I don't
beat it to death, but I'm really

30:08.207 --> 30:09.573
Beat it to death, but I'm really
sorry, guys.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.208
Sorry, guys.
There's four original bayon and

Sorry I didn't get more.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.347
Sorry I didn't get more.
>> so all I'm thinking is, who

30:17.349 --> 30:20.083
>> so all I'm thinking is, who
do I trust more, going into this

30:20.085 --> 30:22.286
Do I trust more, going into this
game, do I trust spencer to go

30:22.288 --> 30:27.257
Game, do I trust spencer to go
with me or could I trust

30:27.259 --> 30:29.059
With me or could I trust
wiglesworth?

30:29.061 --> 30:29.960
Wiglesworth?
>> you all right?

30:29.962 --> 30:30.727
>> you all right?

30:30.729 --> 30:31.228
>> yeah.
I'm fine.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.197
I'm fine.
I just hate going to tribal.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.599
I just hate going to tribal.
I honestly don't think either of

30:35.601 --> 30:36.433
I honestly don't think either of
them have the idol.

30:36.435 --> 30:37.835
Them have the idol.
>> I don't think so.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.204
>> I don't think so.
>> I trust wiglesworth more, but

30:40.206 --> 30:42.072
>> I trust wiglesworth more, but
I think spencer needs us more.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.740
I think spencer needs us more.
>> yeah, yes.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.577
>> yeah, yes.
>> what?

30:46.579 --> 30:53.150
>> what?
>> I think kelly.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.985
>> I think kelly.
>> it would be kind of weird to

30:54.987 --> 30:56.887
>> it would be kind of weird to
me if wiglesworth didn't like

30:56.889 --> 31:01.058
Me if wiglesworth didn't like
ask about what's going on, you

31:01.060 --> 31:01.625
Ask about what's going on, you
know?

31:01.627 --> 31:03.060
Know?
Being the guy on the bottom,

31:03.062 --> 31:06.129
Being the guy on the bottom,
which I'm used to being, I have

31:06.131 --> 31:06.964
Which I'm used to being, I have
to crash conversations.

31:06.966 --> 31:07.598
To crash conversations.
>> you good?

31:07.600 --> 31:08.498
>> you good?
>> I'm good.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.666
>> I'm good.

>> wiglesworth?
>> yeah.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.135
>> yeah.
>> everyone's all set.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.004
>> everyone's all set.
>> I basically just wanted to

31:14.006 --> 31:16.039
>> I basically just wanted to
check in and make sure the plan

31:16.041 --> 31:17.341
Check in and make sure the plan
was to vote out wiglesworth.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.776
Was to vote out wiglesworth.
>> and you guys are going to

31:19.778 --> 31:20.177
>> and you guys are going to
trust me?

31:20.179 --> 31:23.347
Trust me?
>> we're more worried about

31:23.349 --> 31:23.614
>> we're more worried about
kelly.

31:23.616 --> 31:27.150
Kelly.
>> my instinct as a somewhat

31:27.152 --> 31:28.719
>> my instinct as a somewhat
anxious guy, check in, check in,

31:28.721 --> 31:29.920
Anxious guy, check in, check in,
check new york make sure I'm

31:29.922 --> 31:31.421
Check new york make sure I'm
good, make sure I'm good, but

31:31.423 --> 31:32.890
Good, make sure I'm good, but
these people are looking for

31:32.892 --> 31:34.725
These people are looking for
loyalty, and a lot becomes based

31:34.727 --> 31:39.029
Loyalty, and a lot becomes based
on how people feel about you.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.865
On how people feel about you.
It becomes pair mount that you

31:41.867 --> 31:43.500
It becomes pair mount that you
come off as sincere, calm,

31:43.502 --> 31:44.735
Come off as sincere, calm,
confident, so it goes against

31:44.737 --> 31:47.204
Confident, so it goes against
every part of me that loves this

31:47.206 --> 31:51.074
Every part of me that loves this
game, but I have to play it

31:51.076 --> 31:54.378
Game, but I have to play it
cool.

31:54.380 --> 31:58.115
Cool.
>> kelly, I think she's going to

31:58.117 --> 31:58.415
>> kelly, I think she's going to
go.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.484
Go.
>> I'm not sure if I want to get

32:00.486 --> 32:01.585
>> I'm not sure if I want to get
rid of wiglesworth.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.921
Rid of wiglesworth.
I think that keeping wiglesworth

32:03.923 --> 32:06.823
I think that keeping wiglesworth
around might actually benefit my

32:06.825 --> 32:08.325
Around might actually benefit my
game and the hopes of maybe

32:08.327 --> 32:11.929
Game and the hopes of maybe
doing a girl's alliance.

32:11.931 --> 32:16.466
Doing a girl's alliance.
>> I want to try to keep the

32:16.468 --> 32:17.167
>> I want to try to keep the
girl's numbers up.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.168
Girl's numbers up.
Right new it's even.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.871
Right new it's even.
We have four original bayon.

32:20.873 --> 32:24.107
We have four original bayon.
These are our roots.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.609
These are our roots.
Now all of a sudden monica is

32:25.611 --> 32:26.843
Now all of a sudden monica is
looking for an all-girls thing.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.979
Looking for an all-girls thing.
I have no idea where that girl

32:28.981 --> 32:30.614
I have no idea where that girl
is going and she's going to ruin

32:30.616 --> 32:31.548
Is going and she's going to ruin
a really good thing.

32:31.550 --> 32:36.920
A really good thing.
>> we four have to keep

32:36.922 --> 32:37.654
>> we four have to keep
together, 100%.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.623
Together, 100%.
>> monica playing "survivor,"

32:39.625 --> 32:40.824
>> monica playing "survivor,"
she's a liability because she's

32:40.826 --> 32:42.159
She's a liability because she's
a loose cannon.

32:42.161 --> 32:47.064
A loose cannon.
She would be a flipper.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.498
She would be a flipper.
>> she's a snake in the grass.

32:48.500 --> 32:48.932
>> she's a snake in the grass.
>> yeah.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.768
>> yeah.
>> she's a snake in the grass.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.203
>> she's a snake in the grass.
My whole entire ambition is to

32:53.205 --> 32:56.907
My whole entire ambition is to
get to the end, and there are

32:56.909 --> 32:57.941
Get to the end, and there are
going to be casualties.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.710
Going to be casualties.
Monica is not playing for the

32:59.712 --> 33:00.811
Monica is not playing for the
bayon tribe.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.679
Bayon tribe.
Monica is playing for monica.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.915
Monica is playing for monica.
And she will go and step on

33:04.917 --> 33:06.850
And she will go and step on
every single one of us thinking,

33:06.852 --> 33:08.251
Every single one of us thinking,
like, she owns us.

33:08.253 --> 33:09.453
Like, she owns us.
And you know what, the joke's

33:09.455 --> 33:10.187
And you know what, the joke's
going to be on her.

33:10.189 --> 33:14.257
Going to be on her.
>> so we were just talking,

33:14.259 --> 33:15.993
>> so we were just talking,
okay, and she's like what's your

33:15.995 --> 33:17.494
Okay, and she's like what's your
opinion on spencer or kelly.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.363
Opinion on spencer or kelly.
She's like, don't you think we

33:19.365 --> 33:21.898
She's like, don't you think we
need to keep our women's numbers

33:21.900 --> 33:22.849
Need to keep our women's numbers
up?

33:22.850 --> 33:23.799
Up?
>> does she want to go home?

33:23.802 --> 33:27.938
>> does she want to go home?
>> I don't know what she... We

33:27.940 --> 33:28.672
>> I don't know what she... We
have a good thing.

33:28.674 --> 33:29.506
Have a good thing.
>> she's a snake.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.175
>> she's a snake.
>> oh, my god.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.810
>> oh, my god.
>> she's going to mess this up.

33:33.812 --> 33:34.911
>> she's going to mess this up.
We got something really good.

33:34.913 --> 33:36.947
We got something really good.
>> the only thing I can think of

33:36.949 --> 33:39.883
>> the only thing I can think of
is if we go monica and then

33:39.885 --> 33:42.185
Is if we go monica and then
spencer's on our side.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.488
Spencer's on our side.
Spencer will go anywhere because

33:44.490 --> 33:45.689
Spencer will go anywhere because
he's go nowhere.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.724
He's go nowhere.
I don't want to do that, but

33:47.726 --> 33:49.059
I don't want to do that, but
it's something that if she's

33:49.061 --> 33:51.228
It's something that if she's
sitting here saying, keep girls

33:51.230 --> 33:53.463
Sitting here saying, keep girls
numbers up, what if monica goes

33:53.465 --> 33:55.298
Numbers up, what if monica goes
to kelly and spencer and says,

33:55.300 --> 33:57.100
To kelly and spencer and says,
hey, I'll vote with you and

33:57.102 --> 33:59.169
Hey, I'll vote with you and
we'll vote off jeremy or we'll

33:59.171 --> 33:59.903
We'll vote off jeremy or we'll
vote off steve.

33:59.905 --> 34:03.707
Vote off steve.
The three of us have to

34:03.709 --> 34:05.042
The three of us have to
blindside monica.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.144
Blindside monica.
>> monica's just... I don't know

34:07.146 --> 34:08.210
>> monica's just... I don't know
what monica's doing.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.147
What monica's doing.
Why would you tell kimmi we need

34:10.149 --> 34:12.382
Why would you tell kimmi we need
to keep the girls' numbers.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.550
To keep the girls' numbers.
Why would you do that?

34:13.552 --> 34:15.351
Why would you do that?
So it would be cool to see

34:15.353 --> 34:17.853
So it would be cool to see
monica go home off of that.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.656
Monica go home off of that.
I just want to put it out there,

34:19.658 --> 34:22.059
I just want to put it out there,
though, that like it does send a

34:22.061 --> 34:24.293
Though, that like it does send a
bad message to bayon to vote out

34:24.295 --> 34:25.462
Bad message to bayon to vote out
a bayon.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.663
A bayon.
She would be first bayon out of

34:26.665 --> 34:27.030
She would be first bayon out of
this game.

34:27.032 --> 34:27.630
This game.
>> yes.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.766
>> yes.
>> I'm just terrified of a swap.

34:29.768 --> 34:30.132
>> I'm just terrified of a swap.
That's it.

34:30.135 --> 34:31.601
That's it.
>> I know you are.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.870
>> I know you are.
>> jeremy, kimmi and I need to

34:33.871 --> 34:34.938
>> jeremy, kimmi and I need to
decide which way we're going to

34:34.940 --> 34:35.371
Decide which way we're going to
go.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.274
Go.
This could have a really wrong

34:37.275 --> 34:38.608
This could have a really wrong
lasting impact on our whole

34:38.610 --> 34:39.810
Lasting impact on our whole
game.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.011
Game.
If we take out monica, we're

34:41.013 --> 34:42.846
If we take out monica, we're
betraying all of bayon, our

34:42.848 --> 34:43.313
Betraying all of bayon, our
original tribe.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.547
Original tribe.
Then who knows what will happen

34:44.550 --> 34:46.583
Then who knows what will happen
if we swap or merge.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.952
If we swap or merge.
That might violate a lot of

34:48.954 --> 34:50.253
That might violate a lot of
bonds of trust.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.056
Bonds of trust.
In a sense, monica and

34:53.058 --> 34:54.024
In a sense, monica and
wiglesworth are liabilities.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.324
Wiglesworth are liabilities.
You can't count on man camp

34:55.327 --> 34:57.094
You can't count on man camp
she's going to flip and flop.

34:57.096 --> 34:58.562
She's going to flip and flop.
Wiglesworth has ties to ta keo.

34:58.564 --> 34:59.896
Wiglesworth has ties to ta keo.
Getting rid of her now would

34:59.898 --> 35:00.764
Getting rid of her now would
make a lot of sense.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.065
Make a lot of sense.
So it's hard to weigh which one

35:02.067 --> 35:17.180
So it's hard to weigh which one
is more dangerous.

35:29.194 --> 35:29.976
