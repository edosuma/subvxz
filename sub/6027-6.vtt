'There are unconfirmed
reports now of a new outbreak.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.999

It's all there.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.079
Everything they did.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.079
The experiments...

00:56.080 --> 01:00.079
the people they murdered,
everything.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.479
Don't find out the truth
about our father.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.559
We need to find out why
they want the manuscript.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.239
It has the identity of Mr Rabbit.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.839
He's the beating heart of all this,

01:20.840 --> 01:24.839
and if we can find his identity,
it ends, and you go home.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.559
We go and we see if he's got
a Chinese character for "rabbit"

01:28.560 --> 01:30.319
carved on his back.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.759
And then what? Whack him?

01:31.760 --> 01:35.759
Tomorrow at noon I'm good to be here
with every ounce of Thoraxin I have.

01:36.360 --> 01:40.039
Get me those pages, you get it all.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.959
You're right,
it's better than genocide.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.959
That's my assistant's e-mail. If
you get the manuscript, contact him.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.919
I'll take Grant.
He's going to recognise him.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.159
Do you think we can trust him?

01:55.160 --> 01:58.559
Run! Run!

01:58.560 --> 02:02.559
The purpose of Janus is to sterilise
the entire human race.

02:03.160 --> 02:07.159
What we have is an approximation.
We're trying it on a test group.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.959
And the test group is...?

02:08.960 --> 02:12.959
The United Kingdom.

02:13.560 --> 02:16.879
Where the fuck have you been?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.519
Answer her question!

02:18.520 --> 02:20.559
Last time I saw you,
you put a gun to my head.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.559
I needed to get the manuscript.
I set a trap, you were bait.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.359
I'm sorry, let's move on.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.679
Oh, you are such a fucking twat.

02:28.680 --> 02:31.639
Oh, you are such a fucking twat.
Where's Grant?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.039
At the end of the manuscript

02:33.040 --> 02:35.639
the Scientist shouts the name
of Mr Rabbit.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.199
I gave a bunch of pages to Grant,
the name was in them.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.199
They must be here somewhere.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.879
I want those pages. Where is Grant?

02:48.760 --> 02:51.639
Are we going to find Grant?

02:51.640 --> 02:55.359
Alice, we don't know where he is.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.359
I'm sorry.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.119
Hey, you OK?

03:03.120 --> 03:07.119
Hey, you OK?
What? What do you mean?

03:07.880 --> 03:11.639
Oh, yeah. Just a bit stabbed.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.639
What about Janus, is it there?

03:16.640 --> 03:19.239
Wilson, is it in there?

03:19.240 --> 03:22.399
I dunno. Well, there's this.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.319
It's Carvel. He's hiding Janus.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.319
You can't see what in, but he says
it's in his "greatest achievement".

03:31.400 --> 03:33.959
And, then...

03:33.960 --> 03:35.319
..there's this.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.239
He's the god with two faces.

03:39.240 --> 03:43.239
Janus.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.799
No!

03:44.800 --> 03:46.559
No, no!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.239
That's our bedding!
For fuck's sake, pack it in!

03:48.240 --> 03:49.959
Where did he put them?

03:49.960 --> 03:51.239
I want those pages, and I want...

03:51.240 --> 03:53.599
I know! You want Mr Rabbit.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.199
But going off and killing him

03:56.200 --> 03:59.439
isn't going to make your father
any less of a cock than he was.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.079
You psychoanalysing me,
Becky? We best pals now?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.239
You want to borrow my lipstick?

04:04.240 --> 04:07.199
Shit. Are you wearing make-up?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.799
He thought no-one saw.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.799
But he's rubbish at hiding things.

04:17.399 --> 04:21.399
Can we get Grant back now, please?

04:29.680 --> 04:33.679
DOOR ENTRY BUZZES, DOOR OPENS

04:38.040 --> 04:42.039
This is a taser.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.839
You did these drawings?

04:47.840 --> 04:51.839
You copied them from the manuscript,
didn't you?

04:52.440 --> 04:54.439
These numbers are a code.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.519
We believe it describes

04:56.520 --> 05:00.519
the molecular structure of a protein
we call Janus.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.759
Do you know what Janus is, Grant?

05:06.960 --> 05:10.959
You did a very, very good job.
The drawing is excellent.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.359
But not complete.

05:14.360 --> 05:18.359
There are three five-digit numbers
missing.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.559
Do you remember them?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.599
Are you sure, Grant?

05:32.600 --> 05:36.599
Because this is very...!

05:38.800 --> 05:42.799
There's a theory of mnemonics
that states that

05:43.960 --> 05:47.959
human minds retain all visual
information ever seen in a lifetime.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.799
This means youdoknow the numbers.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.999
Mum!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.799
That's my mum.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.319
That's...

06:14.320 --> 06:15.799
No!

06:15.800 --> 06:19.599
Wave for us, Alexi.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.599
Your camera. Wave again, Alexi.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.199
There are many commands
I can give Alexi.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.839
And he will obey them all.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.839
The command I would dearly love to
give is, "stand down, Alexi."

06:39.480 --> 06:41.439
But that depends on you.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.599
Please! Please don't hurt my mum, please!
I'm going to leave the laptop here.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.279
And I'm going to leave this.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.279
And when you remember a number,
write it in, press this buzzer,

06:50.760 --> 06:54.759
and I'll come back.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.599
"Letan"? So, Letan is Mr Rabbit?

07:12.200 --> 07:15.679
Who's Letan?

07:15.680 --> 07:16.719
Jessica, who's Letan?

07:16.720 --> 07:18.679
Jessica, who's Letan?
I have no idea!

07:18.680 --> 07:22.679
Wilson, do you think you can hack
into central records at GCHQ?

07:23.480 --> 07:27.479
No.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.999
I mean, yeah, obviously, I can.
I need a computer.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.679
Not to mention internet.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.239
We'll be outside.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.479
That's not to leave this room.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.319
Could say "please."

07:40.320 --> 07:43.399
Please, Becky, don't take
the manuscript out of this room,

07:43.400 --> 07:45.759
or I will rip your fucking head off.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.799
What about Grant?
We can't just leave him!

07:47.800 --> 07:51.799
What about Grant!

07:55.840 --> 07:59.839
Holy bloody sweaty bollocks!

DOOR ENTRY BEEPS

08:14.760 --> 08:17.639
Doctor here? Is problem?

08:17.640 --> 08:19.279
No, no. It's just a checkup.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.039
We have private cover for you,
Anya,

08:22.040 --> 08:26.039
so the doctor will be coming to you.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.399
Er...
Just wait here, Michael.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.719

the health Minister, Geoff Lawson,

08:55.680 --> 08:58.119
'for stepping up production

08:58.120 --> 09:00.879
'describing him as a national hero.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.959
Do not travel

09:12.960 --> 09:16.279
Keep children, the elderly
and the most vulnerable at home.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.959
We have a vaccine.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.599

DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

09:33.880 --> 09:37.399
You wanted to see me?

09:37.400 --> 09:41.399
I need you to do something.

09:45.320 --> 09:48.279
There is a requirement, as part
of the procedural safeguards,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.439
that the flu vaccine must be
independently tested

09:50.440 --> 09:53.679
in situ 24 hours before its release.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.679
That testing must be verified
by the department and of course,

09:56.680 --> 09:59.199
to guarantee transparency,
it can't be a minister.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.519
It has to be a civil servant.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.879
In fact, it has to be

10:02.880 --> 10:06.879
the private secretary with
responsibility for procurement.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.999
I've supplied a team,
they're downstairs.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.639
Don't question their results.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.159
Just sign it off.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.079
Jesus.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.799
This is why it's me?

10:21.800 --> 10:25.799
This whole thing
has been about that?

10:25.960 --> 10:29.959
'Your security pass has been given
clearance. Go there, get it done.

10:33.560 --> 10:41.560

Stay back, stay back over there!

11:30.785 --> 11:33.344
This is all the Thoraxin I have.

11:33.345 --> 11:36.064
If I see anything odd,
anything that looks like a weapon,

11:36.065 --> 11:39.904
it goes in the fucking lake,
I swear, do you understand?

11:39.905 --> 11:43.904
Do you have it?
Do have the pages?

11:45.145 --> 11:49.144
What I've got for you's in here.

11:53.585 --> 11:54.984
What is this, some kind of joke?

11:54.985 --> 11:57.544
No joke.

11:57.545 --> 11:59.744
I've come to say,
you'll get nothing from me,

11:59.745 --> 12:01.944
ever again.

12:01.945 --> 12:03.824
Are you forgetting what's in here?

12:03.825 --> 12:05.424
Becky, stop shitting around!

12:05.425 --> 12:09.144
I've told them I have it -
I've got a meeting arranged...

12:09.145 --> 12:13.144
Then you'd better run.

12:14.185 --> 12:15.864
Then what are you here for?

12:15.865 --> 12:18.704
To ask you for that.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.584
To ask you to do one decent thing
in your whole life.

12:21.585 --> 12:25.584
To ask you...
to give me those drugs.

13:12.185 --> 13:16.184
You OK?

13:18.185 --> 13:22.184
I don't know if the Diaz
has kicked in, you know?

13:25.265 --> 13:29.264
The clumsiness could be
psychosomatic, stress, that happens.

13:31.785 --> 13:35.784
My dad had full-on fits,
that's how we first knew...

13:38.945 --> 13:42.424
I'm not going to leave you.

13:42.425 --> 13:46.424
I just won't.

13:51.385 --> 13:55.384
Tremors, loss of muscle control,
paralysis...

13:59.025 --> 14:03.024
..and eventually
suffocation and death.

14:05.585 --> 14:09.584
I don't know if I want to go through
all that with someone watching me.

14:21.705 --> 14:24.424
Is it a code, then?

14:24.425 --> 14:26.984
Um... Yeah, probably.

14:26.985 --> 14:30.984
In part one, people always
thought this was binary,

14:31.385 --> 14:35.384
but no-one has ever
been able to work it out.

14:35.745 --> 14:37.144
But...

14:37.145 --> 14:41.024
in this part...

14:41.025 --> 14:44.104
there's a corresponding page...

14:44.105 --> 14:46.144
The numbers are boring.

14:46.145 --> 14:50.144
I like the art.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.904
Well, can you get in?

14:55.905 --> 14:57.104
Get in?

14:57.105 --> 14:58.664
I am in.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.424
It's UK security.

15:00.425 --> 15:03.384
Practically takes your shoes off
and makes you a cup of tea.

15:03.385 --> 15:05.744
It's the searchers
that are taking their time.

15:05.745 --> 15:08.184
I'm having to make myself
look like a UFO nutter

15:08.185 --> 15:09.624
just to get below the radar,

15:09.625 --> 15:12.664
which means I've got to check
each database individually.

15:12.665 --> 15:14.784
How many databases are there?

15:14.785 --> 15:18.784
56,000, or thereabouts.

15:19.745 --> 15:22.184
Why don't you take
the mobile unit outside

15:22.185 --> 15:26.184
and check the civilian channels?

15:27.305 --> 15:29.104
No.

15:29.105 --> 15:33.104
I'll do it here.

16:16.465 --> 16:20.464

we're getting somewhere.

17:02.545 --> 17:04.064
Only two to go.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.904
No, mate...

17:06.905 --> 17:10.064
I can't. I've been trying so hard,
but please, I can't, I can't...

17:10.065 --> 17:12.023
Please.

17:12.025 --> 17:16.023
Then I'll have to bring your mother
in and torture her in front of you.

17:16.345 --> 17:20.344
Please don't make me do that.

Look, look, look...
I was protecting my family!

18:40.825 --> 18:43.304
There's a woman here
who's having my child,

18:43.305 --> 18:47.304
I was just...
I know where the vaccine is!

Anya, no! It's fine, it's...

19:00.705 --> 19:02.904
Calm her down!
Calm her the fuck down!

19:02.905 --> 19:06.584
Anya, Anya, please! It's fine,
it's OK, he's not going to hurt us.

19:06.585 --> 19:07.624
OK?! He has gun, Michael...

19:07.625 --> 19:10.384
OK?! He has gun, Michael... I just need to
give him some information and it'll be OK...

19:10.385 --> 19:11.144
Information?!

19:11.145 --> 19:13.784
Information?!
Anya, please. I swear! It'll be OK!

19:13.785 --> 19:17.784
No, whoa! Anya's... pregnant.

19:18.145 --> 19:20.904
It's my child.

19:20.905 --> 19:22.224
They blackmailed me.

19:22.225 --> 19:24.144
So why are you helping us now?

19:24.145 --> 19:26.064
The vaccine goes out tomorrow.

19:26.065 --> 19:30.064
64 million shots.

19:30.265 --> 19:34.264
The warehouse is at
164 Cantwell Way, Stevenage.

19:35.905 --> 19:37.184
You got a computer here?

19:37.185 --> 19:39.264
Why?
Google Maps.

19:39.265 --> 19:43.264
If there isn't a warehouse there,
I'll blow your fucking brains out.

19:53.705 --> 19:56.104
I'm sorry.

19:56.105 --> 19:59.704
I was trying to protect people.

19:59.705 --> 20:01.184
I wanted my family safe...

20:01.185 --> 20:02.664
So you just handed us over?

20:02.665 --> 20:04.464
Michael... he make trouble, yes?

20:04.465 --> 20:06.264
Please, I not trust...

20:06.265 --> 20:09.064
Anya, please! It's all right,

20:09.065 --> 20:11.584
I promise!

20:11.585 --> 20:14.344
There.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.384
There... I... I want to help.

20:16.385 --> 20:18.624
I can get you inside,
if you just trust me.

20:18.625 --> 20:22.064
Anya, no! Don't, he's not...

20:22.065 --> 20:24.344
Anya, no!
Don't, he's not what...

20:29.825 --> 20:33.824
I have a situation,
I need to speak to Control now.

20:35.185 --> 20:39.184
Two minutes, no more, then.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.584
You're... You're English?

20:43.585 --> 20:47.584
I... I don't...

20:48.585 --> 20:50.184
You're with them?!

20:50.185 --> 20:51.864
Stay quiet if you want to live.

20:51.865 --> 20:53.384
Is your name even Anya?

20:53.385 --> 20:55.384
Oh, God, oh, God...

20:55.385 --> 20:58.144
The baby... Is there...?

20:58.145 --> 21:01.184
Oh, no, but there were scans,
I saw scans...

21:01.185 --> 21:05.184
You speak again, I will fire this
into your fucking face, understand?

21:10.625 --> 21:14.624
For fuck's sake!

21:45.825 --> 21:49.824
You OK? Is she...

21:59.105 --> 22:03.104
We need to go.

23:08.945 --> 23:12.944
How's it going?

23:15.065 --> 23:19.064
I think I found him.

23:20.545 --> 23:24.064
It's the minutes of a defence
department meeting in 1976,

23:24.065 --> 23:27.064
something called
The Committee Of Genetic Discovery.

23:27.065 --> 23:31.064
The document's redacted,
the only information is formal stuff,

23:31.425 --> 23:34.984
like time and place
and the names of those attending.

23:34.985 --> 23:36.464
None of those names are Letan.

23:36.465 --> 23:38.304
But in the footnotes...

23:38.305 --> 23:42.304
a comment attributed to Letan.

23:45.425 --> 23:49.424
They changed his name on
all official documentation, but...

23:49.465 --> 23:53.464
they missed the footnote.

23:53.505 --> 23:57.504
So Letan was there...
He's one of these people.

23:58.265 --> 23:59.624
Mm-hm.

23:59.625 --> 24:03.624
All we need to do
is pull up their photos.

24:03.785 --> 24:06.304
Wilson...

24:06.305 --> 24:13.104
you've just found Mr Rabbit.

24:13.891 --> 24:17.890
There were 18 on the committee.
Of those, 14 were men.

24:18.131 --> 24:21.810
Six are dead, one's in
a nursing home, leaving these seven.

24:21.811 --> 24:25.810
One of them is Letan.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.370
One of them is Mr Rabbit.

24:28.371 --> 24:31.530
Do you recognise any of these men?

24:31.531 --> 24:35.530
No. None.

24:35.811 --> 24:39.810
Do you?

24:43.371 --> 24:47.050
So, what do we do?

24:47.051 --> 24:49.770
We kill them.

24:49.771 --> 24:51.690
All of them.

24:51.691 --> 24:52.730
Are you serious?

24:52.731 --> 24:54.970
One of them is Mr Rabbit.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.610
But six of them aren't!
It's called collateral damage.

24:57.611 --> 25:00.770
It's called psychopathy.
You can't just kill them all.

25:00.771 --> 25:02.410
I mean, where are they?

25:02.411 --> 25:03.930
How long would that take?

25:03.931 --> 25:05.050
So we make a start.

25:05.051 --> 25:09.050
Jessica, you're too emotionally
involved in all this.

25:09.251 --> 25:10.290
Excuse me?

25:10.291 --> 25:12.530
I've read the manuscript, OK?

25:12.531 --> 25:14.850
I know what he did to you.

25:14.851 --> 25:18.850
But this weird, freaky,
slightly sociopathic,

25:19.931 --> 25:22.570
Oedipal thing you've got going on
is putting us all in danger.

25:22.571 --> 25:26.570
I swear to Christ, if you don't stop
and shut your fucking mouth...

25:27.171 --> 25:28.210
He's with them!

25:28.211 --> 25:29.410
No, no, Alice! It's OK!

25:29.411 --> 25:30.450
It's all right!

25:30.451 --> 25:32.010
Fuck, Ian, you brought him here?!

25:32.011 --> 25:35.770
No, my name is Michael Dugdale.
I'm with the Department of Health.

25:35.771 --> 25:37.570
I'll cut your fucking face off!

25:37.571 --> 25:39.170
I know where the vaccine is.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.050
They're releasing it tomorrow.

25:41.051 --> 25:42.930
The whole thing
is going out overnight.

25:42.931 --> 25:46.370
Tomorrow morning, it'll start
going into people's arms

25:46.371 --> 25:50.370
and there is such a lot of it.
There's 64 million shots.

25:59.811 --> 26:01.850
Why have you got a picture of him?

26:01.851 --> 26:03.090
Which one?

26:03.091 --> 26:06.330
That...

26:06.331 --> 26:07.930
That's Conran Letts' assistant.

26:07.931 --> 26:11.930
He's the man running Corvadt.

27:06.531 --> 27:10.530
Only one number to go, Grant.

27:15.131 --> 27:18.170
I know, but...
Can I go home, please?

27:18.171 --> 27:21.010
Absolutely.

27:21.011 --> 27:25.010
Of course you can.

27:39.651 --> 27:42.850
Jessica, it's broad daylight.
You can't just go in and whack him.

27:42.851 --> 27:44.330
Give me my gun.

27:44.331 --> 27:45.170
And what about the warehouse?

27:45.171 --> 27:46.850
And what about the warehouse?
The vaccine is going out tonight.

27:46.851 --> 27:48.970
We really need to do something.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.970
What is the matter with you people?

27:50.971 --> 27:54.530
How many times do I have to tell you
this all stops when he dies?

27:54.531 --> 27:56.770
For God's sake, this is not

27:56.771 --> 27:59.330
what you would normally do.
You would at least wait until dark.

27:59.331 --> 28:03.330
Give me my gun.

28:07.331 --> 28:11.330
My knife can be opening
your throat very easily.

28:11.851 --> 28:13.450
I don't think you'd do that.

28:13.451 --> 28:14.490
Ian?

28:14.491 --> 28:16.210
Want to find out?

28:16.211 --> 28:20.210
Guys, I think there's something
you should see.

28:20.371 --> 28:21.930
Really.

28:21.931 --> 28:25.930
You should really see this.

29:01.531 --> 29:05.530
What is it?

29:06.211 --> 29:08.850
It's a molecule.

29:08.851 --> 29:11.170
It's Janus.

29:11.171 --> 29:15.170
This is what
they've been looking for.

29:15.371 --> 29:18.930
The vaccine is a test,
to see if it works.

29:18.931 --> 29:22.090
But this is the real thing.

29:22.091 --> 29:26.090
This is the real Janus.

29:27.971 --> 29:31.970
You did well to find all this.

29:34.171 --> 29:35.610
You're very clever.

29:35.611 --> 29:39.610
Don't patronise me.

29:44.451 --> 29:48.450
I like jigsaws.

29:51.211 --> 29:55.010
I'm sorry about Grant.

29:55.011 --> 29:59.010
I thought I was
protecting my family.

30:03.491 --> 30:07.490
My wife and I...

30:08.251 --> 30:12.250
..we wanted a child very badly.

30:14.851 --> 30:18.850
We thought we had one.

30:20.731 --> 30:24.730
We had been trying
for a very long time.

30:24.931 --> 30:28.650
IVF?

30:28.651 --> 30:32.650
My mum said she was going to do that,
before I was born.

30:35.011 --> 30:39.010
Then I suddenly happened.

30:40.371 --> 30:44.370
She said I was a miracle.

30:47.531 --> 30:51.530
"Little Mary Miracle", she called me.

30:54.251 --> 30:58.250
It annoyed me.

31:02.211 --> 31:06.210
They shot her.

31:08.211 --> 31:12.210
I saw it.

31:16.691 --> 31:20.690
Would you like to talk about it?

31:43.011 --> 31:46.690
So he experimented on you?

31:46.691 --> 31:50.010
Carvel?

31:50.011 --> 31:54.010
It's in the manuscript.

32:01.891 --> 32:05.890
In the published version,
the devil imprisons me.

32:07.131 --> 32:11.130
But in the manuscript,
it's my father,

32:11.251 --> 32:15.250
holding me, like all the others,
to use for experiments.

32:18.051 --> 32:22.050
I was hardly a living thing
as far as they were concerned.

32:23.011 --> 32:27.010
They both deserve death.

32:28.331 --> 32:31.210
And you think this is going
to make you feel better?

32:31.211 --> 32:33.010
Yeah.

32:33.011 --> 32:37.010
Yeah, I do, actually.

32:47.931 --> 32:49.450
Who have we got it going to?

32:49.451 --> 32:53.090
46 scientists, two Nobel
Laureates, nine politicians,

32:53.091 --> 32:57.090
several police forces
and a shedload of journalists.

32:59.891 --> 33:03.210
So this is it.

33:03.211 --> 33:05.690
We press that button...

33:05.691 --> 33:08.810
..and everything's out there.

33:08.811 --> 33:11.490
All of it.

33:11.491 --> 33:15.490
Listen, Ian,
do you think this is right?

33:16.291 --> 33:20.290
I mean, Janus is the biggest
thing in history, ever.

33:20.891 --> 33:23.290
And we're here,

33:23.291 --> 33:24.810
at the centre of it.

33:24.811 --> 33:28.810
What are you talking about?

33:30.091 --> 33:32.010
There is a future coming

33:32.011 --> 33:36.010
where billions of us are going
to be born into poverty.

33:37.891 --> 33:41.330
And we are going to murder
each other in war

33:41.331 --> 33:44.450
for water, food and oil.

33:44.451 --> 33:46.890
That is coming.

33:46.891 --> 33:50.890
Maybe in our lifetime.

33:51.211 --> 33:54.650
The Network's the enemy.

33:54.651 --> 33:58.650
But what if the enemy is right?

34:02.211 --> 34:06.210
Press the button, Wilson.

34:17.531 --> 34:21.530
They might think it's a hoax.
Think they'll take it seriously?

34:22.690 --> 34:24.130
Yeah.

34:24.130 --> 34:28.130
At least they will when we burn
the warehouse to the ground.

34:37.251 --> 34:40.449
I downloaded some blueprints -

34:40.451 --> 34:44.449
a map of the Corvadt building,
showing the office.

34:45.210 --> 34:49.210
I want to go with you.

34:50.371 --> 34:54.370
I'm not going to be much good lugging
cans of petrol round a warehouse.

34:57.731 --> 35:01.730
Look... they killed my dad, Jessica.

35:05.331 --> 35:09.330
They destroyed my life, too.

35:15.811 --> 35:18.411
You ready, then?

35:31.804 --> 35:35.803
You're very brave.
But try not to look so scared.

35:36.324 --> 35:40.323
Right.

35:41.204 --> 35:44.923
Just hang it there. See?

35:44.924 --> 35:48.523
Don't get the gun out until
you get to the video room.

35:48.524 --> 35:52.323
Then you make him
disable all relays, OK?

35:52.324 --> 35:55.323
And what if he
doesn't do what I say?

35:55.324 --> 35:58.323
Hit him with the gun.

35:58.324 --> 36:02.323
What, like with the fat end?

36:02.364 --> 36:06.363
Yeah. The fat end.

36:20.924 --> 36:24.923
All right?

36:29.404 --> 36:31.083
OK.

36:31.084 --> 36:35.083
Thank you.

37:09.564 --> 37:13.563
I've seen one of these before.
They're based on the Y-GAN protocol,

37:13.884 --> 37:16.763
which is actually quite sloppy.
If we can access the reader,

37:16.764 --> 37:20.763
then maybe we can...

37:30.164 --> 37:34.163
Or, yeah, we could just do that.

38:15.404 --> 38:18.763
I don't get why there's no guards.

38:18.764 --> 38:22.763
I don't get it.

38:41.564 --> 38:45.563
You didn't send the email?

38:47.004 --> 38:51.003
I freed Letts.

38:51.484 --> 38:55.483
And I pushed the knife into
my own stomach because...

38:56.924 --> 39:00.923
..theyareright.

39:02.444 --> 39:06.003
Just give me the manuscript.

39:06.004 --> 39:10.003
ELECTRONIC BUZZER.
DOOR UNLOCKS, THEN OPENS.

39:21.524 --> 39:25.123
This isn't right. This is
just cohesi-9 modified.

39:25.124 --> 39:29.123
That's the number, mate.
That is the one, I swear.

39:30.924 --> 39:34.323
But I got a number wrong when I
drew it so I changed that. Look.

39:34.324 --> 39:36.563
Which one?

39:36.564 --> 39:37.683
Which one's wrong?

39:37.684 --> 39:41.683
That one. Look.

39:50.484 --> 39:54.483
HE GROANS

40:11.164 --> 40:15.163
We can't be the people that
destroys humanity's chance at life.

40:18.844 --> 40:21.883
We can't.

40:21.884 --> 40:25.883
I'm not giving it to you.

40:29.284 --> 40:33.283
Jessica, please don't.

40:38.644 --> 40:42.643
Please don't.

40:46.324 --> 40:50.323
Stand down, Alexi.

41:31.764 --> 41:33.083
Jessica.

41:33.084 --> 41:35.683
This is my Dad.

41:35.684 --> 41:38.763
It's all I've got.

41:38.764 --> 41:42.723
I'm not giving him to you.

41:42.724 --> 41:44.723
Please.

41:44.724 --> 41:46.443
LIFT DOOR PINGS

41:54.764 --> 41:58.763
Are you all right?

42:10.964 --> 42:14.963
Grant?

42:16.844 --> 42:20.803
Have you seen this man?

42:20.804 --> 42:24.803
He's dead.

42:26.844 --> 42:30.843
I killed him, Jessica.

42:35.924 --> 42:37.643
Come on.

42:37.644 --> 42:39.723
What about Wilson?

42:39.724 --> 42:43.723
WhataboutWilson?

42:52.964 --> 42:56.963
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

42:58.364 --> 43:00.603
BECKY GASPS

43:00.604 --> 43:01.963
Is this all of them?

43:01.964 --> 43:03.843
It is. That was all we were told.

43:03.844 --> 43:07.043
Are you sure? I don't
want any nasty surprises.

43:07.044 --> 43:08.963
Jessica Hyde, for example.

43:08.964 --> 43:12.963
She's not with these.

43:22.084 --> 43:23.563
Please, Alice.

43:23.564 --> 43:26.763
What?
The girl.

43:26.764 --> 43:28.683
Don't make her see.

43:28.684 --> 43:32.683
Yes, of course.

43:34.884 --> 43:36.563
Alice, is it?

43:36.564 --> 43:37.723
Mm-hmm.

43:37.724 --> 43:40.163
Now what I want you to
do is to pop in there,

43:40.164 --> 43:44.163
close your eyes very tight and count
to 99. Will you do that for me?

43:44.404 --> 43:48.403
And Alice, it's very important
that you don't run or hide, OK?

43:52.004 --> 43:56.003
Good girl.

44:14.964 --> 44:17.683
You... You're not going to kill us?

44:17.684 --> 44:20.043
Why would I kill you?

44:20.044 --> 44:23.643
But you sent Alice in...
She's 12. Christ, Ian,

44:23.644 --> 44:27.643
what do I have to do to convince
you people I'm on your fucking side?

44:28.484 --> 44:29.883
We thought you were dead!

44:29.884 --> 44:31.683
Well, apparently I'm not.

44:31.684 --> 44:39.684
We haven't much time.
I understand you have petrol?

46:12.364 --> 46:16.363
SLOW PIANO MUSIC

46:21.683 --> 46:25.682
Grant!

46:28.603 --> 46:32.602
Where's Wilson?

46:48.763 --> 46:52.762
BIRDS TWITTERING

47:18.923 --> 47:22.562
All right then, shithead...

47:22.563 --> 47:26.562
Let's give it a go.

47:42.203 --> 47:46.202
No-one's come.

47:46.283 --> 47:50.282
They know we're here and must know we
did it, but no-one's come for us.

47:56.283 --> 47:59.402
We're going to Fortingall.

47:59.403 --> 48:03.402
The Highlands of Scotland,
we're catching a train to Glasgow.

48:05.803 --> 48:07.162
Bit remote, isn't it?

48:07.163 --> 48:09.242
Yes.

48:09.243 --> 48:12.962
Leona said to give it
a month before returning.

48:12.963 --> 48:14.602
We're pretending it's a holiday.

48:14.603 --> 48:18.602
That's how long she reckons they'll
need to mop up everyone else, if...

48:20.683 --> 48:24.682
She has the manuscript.

48:31.043 --> 48:35.042
We have to give it to her.

48:36.403 --> 48:39.642
Jessica.

48:39.643 --> 48:43.642
She needs it to end all this.

48:47.323 --> 48:50.522
MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY

48:50.523 --> 48:51.842
So, what?

48:51.843 --> 48:54.602
Alice is going with him?

48:54.603 --> 48:56.362
Yes.

48:56.363 --> 48:59.922
She wants to.

48:59.923 --> 49:02.882
Because she's alone.

49:02.883 --> 49:04.282
They want a child.

49:04.283 --> 49:07.082
Yeah, but he's a cock.

49:07.083 --> 49:11.082
I don't reckon she'll go with him.

49:12.643 --> 49:15.322
Are you all right to come with us?

49:15.323 --> 49:19.322
Just until we get all this sorted
and get you back to your mum?

49:21.883 --> 49:25.882
I don't reckon she'll go with him.

49:32.363 --> 49:36.362
Yeah, it's probably for the best.

49:49.283 --> 49:53.282
You going with that dickhead?

49:55.003 --> 49:59.002
I'll miss you, twat.

51:05.043 --> 51:06.762
Jessica.

51:06.763 --> 51:10.762
It is so good to meet you.

51:15.563 --> 51:18.562
It's fine.
I'll take you through.

51:18.563 --> 51:22.562
I promise you, it'll be fine.

51:36.203 --> 51:40.202
It's in there?

51:42.643 --> 51:45.122
The last thing we want is
for what's in that manuscript

51:45.123 --> 51:47.602
to become public knowledge.

51:47.603 --> 51:51.602
This way I can use it,
then destroy it.

51:53.323 --> 51:54.642
Jessica...

51:54.643 --> 51:58.642
It needs to be like this.

52:26.323 --> 52:30.322
I'm just going to get
the tickets, all right?

52:36.203 --> 52:40.122
Wait here, I'll get us
a secure room.

52:40.123 --> 52:42.202
When you're ready,
you can show me.

52:42.203 --> 52:46.202
Does that sound OK?

52:48.763 --> 52:51.162
Do you need anything?
Tea, or...?

52:51.163 --> 52:55.162
No, thank you.

53:04.963 --> 53:07.162
Argh!

53:07.163 --> 53:08.482
Becky...

53:08.483 --> 53:09.922
Becky!

53:09.923 --> 53:11.202
Becky!

53:11.203 --> 53:15.202
Help!

53:22.763 --> 53:24.242
Jesus Christ!

53:24.243 --> 53:26.202
She just started,
I don't know what happened.

53:26.203 --> 53:27.442
She just started...

53:27.443 --> 53:28.642
Becky.

53:28.643 --> 53:30.242
Is she OK?

53:30.243 --> 53:32.282
Becky, Becky.

53:32.283 --> 53:33.722
Are you all right?

53:33.723 --> 53:37.442
Is your head all right,
did you bang your head?

53:37.443 --> 53:39.322
Did I fit?

53:39.323 --> 53:41.522
Was that a fit?

53:41.523 --> 53:43.082
Did I fit, Ian?

53:43.083 --> 53:45.122
Shh...

53:45.123 --> 53:47.922
Ian... Ian... We'll get you some help.
All right?

53:47.923 --> 53:49.602
Can I have some water, please?

53:49.603 --> 53:51.322
Please...

53:51.323 --> 53:53.442
Sit with her.

53:53.443 --> 53:57.442
Don't leave her.

54:03.843 --> 54:06.162
Are you all right?

54:06.163 --> 54:08.402
Ta, Paul.

54:08.403 --> 54:12.402
INAUDIBLE VOICES

54:23.043 --> 54:27.042
VOICES CONTINUE

54:33.243 --> 54:35.162
'My dad wrote it down.

54:35.163 --> 54:37.282
'It is so good to meet you.

54:37.283 --> 54:38.722
'People always let you down.

54:38.723 --> 54:42.722
'This way I can use it...'

54:43.963 --> 54:46.962
'It's called, "toe the line."

54:46.963 --> 54:48.202
'I usually did that.

54:48.203 --> 54:51.442
'From a long plateau in Canada.

54:51.443 --> 54:53.242
'He used to say,

54:53.243 --> 54:56.402
' "This rock gives you
permission to do anything."

54:56.403 --> 54:57.922
'Please, Mr Rabbit.

54:57.923 --> 55:00.282
'Are you sure you don't remember
the name of Mr Rabbit?

55:00.283 --> 55:02.282
'This all stops when he dies.

55:02.283 --> 55:03.482
'Who's Mr Rabbit?

55:03.483 --> 55:04.642
'I have no idea.

55:04.643 --> 55:07.442
'There are 18 on the committee.
Those 14 were men.

55:07.443 --> 55:10.522
'He's one of these people.

55:10.523 --> 55:12.522
'All we need to do is put
up their photos.

55:12.523 --> 55:14.162
'Do you recognise any of these men?

55:14.163 --> 55:15.642
'One of these is Mr Rabbit.

55:15.643 --> 55:16.762
'I have no idea.

55:16.763 --> 55:18.722
'There's a story about how
he got his name.

55:18.723 --> 55:21.442
'He was playing
everyone against each other.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.842
'She's like us, works in secret.

55:23.843 --> 55:25.562
'Trusts no-one.

55:25.563 --> 55:27.122
'Who's Mr Rabbit?

55:27.123 --> 55:31.122
'Milner, her name's Milner...

56:00.243 --> 56:04.242
Stop!

56:12.203 --> 56:15.602
Oh, our train is leaving.

56:15.603 --> 56:16.922
But...

56:16.923 --> 56:18.482
Go find Ian.

56:18.483 --> 56:20.202
But he said, "Stay with you."

56:20.203 --> 56:24.202
Quick! Quick, or we'll miss it.

56:49.803 --> 56:51.642
Becky says the train's leaving now.

56:51.643 --> 56:52.882
What?

56:52.883 --> 56:56.882
It's not for another ten...

57:04.483 --> 57:08.482
Stay here, don't move.
Just stay here!

57:58.003 --> 58:02.002
WHISTLE BLOWS

58:38.443 --> 58:42.442
You can go.

58:51.123 --> 58:53.002
Here to ground kill.

58:53.003 --> 58:55.522
A man so dedicated to the cause

58:55.523 --> 58:58.122
that he carved lines
into his own flesh

58:58.123 --> 59:00.602
to act as cover.

59:00.603 --> 59:04.002
That's how important
this is, Jessica.

59:04.003 --> 59:07.162
But you helped burn
the warehouse, the vaccine,

59:07.163 --> 59:08.722
you destroyed it...

59:08.723 --> 59:10.242
The vaccine may well have worked.

59:10.243 --> 59:12.042
It may not have.

59:12.043 --> 59:15.362
We never had
the genius of your father.

59:15.363 --> 59:17.802
Once I found out that he had
finished Janus,

59:17.803 --> 59:21.042
I knew that was all that mattered.

59:21.043 --> 59:22.602
His work, Jessica.

59:22.603 --> 59:23.842
Yeah, well, fuck you.

59:23.843 --> 59:27.002
Fuck both of you, it's over.

59:27.003 --> 59:28.882
I burned it.

59:28.883 --> 59:32.882
I destroyed your work,
Janus is gone!

59:41.683 --> 59:43.362
That?

59:43.363 --> 59:47.362
Oh, that's just a bunch of old
drawings done by a crazy man.

59:47.483 --> 59:51.482
I only wanted that because I knew
you'd be the one bringing it.

59:57.123 --> 59:58.002
GUN SHOT

59:58.003 --> 59:59.082
GUN SHOT Argh!

59:59.083 --> 01:00:00.882
Sorry.

01:00:00.883 --> 01:00:04.882
I don't want you jumping.

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:10.962
From the moment you were born
he just fell in love.

01:00:10.963 --> 01:00:14.962
He considered you his
'greatest achievement'.

01:00:18.163 --> 01:00:22.162
And that's where he hid Janus.

01:00:22.443 --> 01:00:23.722
It's in me?

01:00:23.723 --> 01:00:25.442
You should be happy.

01:00:25.443 --> 01:00:28.282
Isn't that what you've
always wanted? Daddy's love?

01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:32.002
Daddy loved you so much he hid
the most important thing

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.962
the world has ever known...

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.962
..in you.

01:00:41.963 --> 01:00:44.322
We'd better get started, you and I.

01:00:44.323 --> 01:00:48.322
We have so much to do.
