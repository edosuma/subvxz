TONY:
           <i>Hey, Louie?</i>

01:18.578 --> 01:20.345
Go ahead, Banta. What is it?

01:20.413 --> 01:23.515
TONY: Louie? Hey, Louie,
I got a ten-year-old in my cab.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.484
And I just found out
        he's a runaway.

01:25.551 --> 01:26.751
He owes me 12 bucks,

01:26.819 --> 01:28.520
and turns out,
       he's only got two.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.922
He won't tell me where he lives.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.191
Bring that little crook in here.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.327
We're gonna find out
      who his parents are

01:35.394 --> 01:38.330
and sweat that money out
            of them.

01:38.397 --> 01:40.031
All right, Louie,
            I'm bringing him in.

01:40.098 --> 01:42.601
Come on, now, you're scaring
          the kid half to death.

01:42.701 --> 01:44.603
Come on, say something
                nice to him now,

01:44.703 --> 01:45.803
make him feel better.

01:45.871 --> 01:48.072
Calm him down a
             little bit, please?

01:48.140 --> 01:51.309
LOUIE:
    Sure, sure, Banta, sure.

01:51.377 --> 01:52.577
Hey, kid,

01:52.645 --> 01:54.879
uh, do you like Little League?

01:54.947 --> 01:56.181
Yes.

01:56.249 --> 01:58.116
Do you like soccer?

01:58.184 --> 01:59.584
Yes.

01:59.652 --> 02:00.952
You like jail?

02:01.020 --> 02:03.522
No!

02:05.691 --> 02:07.626
Don't worry about it.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.363
Ah!
Oh, come on...

02:11.430 --> 02:13.231
Bring him over here,
       bring him over...

02:13.299 --> 02:16.167
Look at this, huh?

02:16.235 --> 02:18.003
This is the
             criminal mastermind

02:18.070 --> 02:19.537
who outsmarted Banta.

02:19.605 --> 02:20.839
ELAINE:
                             Oh!

02:20.907 --> 02:22.273
Louie!
        Come here.

02:22.341 --> 02:23.341
Go on.
        Sit down, honey.

02:23.408 --> 02:24.309
Hey.
Hey, Lou...

02:24.376 --> 02:26.711
Come on,
                       Lou, huh?
                        Now,

02:26.779 --> 02:27.812
what's your name, honey?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.080
Terry.

02:29.147 --> 02:32.183
Terry. Terry, uh,
     what's your last name?

02:32.251 --> 02:34.018
I forget.

02:34.086 --> 02:37.389
No question he's a
                match for Banta.

02:37.456 --> 02:39.524
Hey, Louie, would you
take it easy here?

02:39.591 --> 02:41.092
We're trying
to help this kid.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.094
I already helped him.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.896
I called the cops.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.397
ELAINE:
                    What? Louie!
That's right.
That's right.

02:46.465 --> 02:47.798
ALEX:
               What's the matter
                       with you?

02:47.867 --> 02:49.567
The police. Thumbscrews.

02:49.634 --> 02:50.801
Oh.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.270
Batons.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.607
This little crook is into this
     company for 13 bucks.

02:55.674 --> 02:58.309
I've never
                    been able
                    to do this.

02:58.377 --> 02:59.444
That's because...

02:59.511 --> 03:00.745
(clears throat)

03:00.813 --> 03:03.348
...you shouldn't be thinking
about a card

03:03.416 --> 03:05.717
or how you hold it.

03:05.784 --> 03:08.720
Just be the card.

03:11.157 --> 03:13.925
Be the hat.

03:14.026 --> 03:16.127
I don't...

03:16.195 --> 03:18.029
Don't question!

03:18.097 --> 03:20.164
Be.

03:22.201 --> 03:23.435
Hey!

03:23.502 --> 03:25.603
Whoa! Does that work
for everything?

03:25.638 --> 03:26.604
I don't know.

03:26.671 --> 03:30.174
It always worked for me
     for parallel parking.

03:32.478 --> 03:34.178
Hey, Terry, listen,
      you got to go home,

03:34.247 --> 03:36.347
so you got to tell us
        where you live.

03:36.415 --> 03:37.515
I won't go home.

03:37.583 --> 03:38.850
Uh, may...

03:38.917 --> 03:40.518
May I say something?

03:40.586 --> 03:43.521
When I was a boy...

03:43.589 --> 03:46.724
(laughs and clears throat)

03:46.792 --> 03:49.861
...I ran away from home once.

03:49.929 --> 03:53.364
It was an important experience
            for me.

03:53.432 --> 03:57.568
If somebody had called
the police

03:57.636 --> 04:01.105
and taken me home right away,
           who knows?

04:01.173 --> 04:05.242
I might never have turned out
   to be the man I am today.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.180
Yeah, you see that, kid?

04:09.248 --> 04:12.550
Tell us your name before
   your brain sprouts fungus.

04:13.452 --> 04:15.320
We'll take care
                  of him, Louie.

04:15.387 --> 04:17.355
He belongs to
                    our species.

04:17.456 --> 04:19.656
Sit down, kid. Sit down.

04:19.724 --> 04:22.327
Now, Terry,
    think about your mother.

04:22.394 --> 04:24.295
She must be
                   worried sick.

04:24.363 --> 04:26.130
You know, I have
                    a little son

04:26.198 --> 04:28.132
and if he ever
                       ran away,

04:28.200 --> 04:29.767
it would kill me.

04:29.835 --> 04:32.536
You know what he does when
          he gets upset with me?

04:32.604 --> 04:34.038
He just stops
                  talking to me.

04:34.106 --> 04:35.906
He just won't say
               a word, you know?

04:35.975 --> 04:37.775
Now don't you think
             that's a lot better

04:37.843 --> 04:39.777
than running away
            and making me worry?

04:41.347 --> 04:43.647
I hate it when they do that!

04:43.683 --> 04:46.217
Oh, Elaine.

04:46.284 --> 04:47.785
Listen, kid, um,

04:47.853 --> 04:49.253
Elaine's got
                   a point there

04:49.321 --> 04:53.324
about how worried
               your parents must
               be over in, uh...

04:53.391 --> 04:55.260
Where did you
                 say they lived?

04:57.329 --> 04:58.863
Come on, kid, now talk,

04:58.930 --> 05:02.200
or we're gonna have to
    start tickling it out of ya.

05:02.267 --> 05:05.103
Nice try, Alex.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.238
You know,

05:07.305 --> 05:10.775
he reminds me more
             and more of myself.

05:13.111 --> 05:16.313
He's not going back,
       and neither am I.

05:16.381 --> 05:17.681
Okay.

05:17.717 --> 05:20.585
Thanks, Mister.

05:20.652 --> 05:22.587
Just call me Jim.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.428
LOUIE:
                             Ah!

05:30.496 --> 05:31.730
Okay, where's the kid?

05:31.797 --> 05:32.964
LOUIE:
                   Oh. Oh, good.

05:33.031 --> 05:34.566
ALEX:
                So, what's this?

05:34.633 --> 05:36.901
We got a
                    bright one.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.302
Uh, hey,
don't worry, Terry.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.705
This guy's just here
to help you. Don't worry.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.341
All right, come on,
          here, here.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.745
This is the little crook
        who owes me $13,

05:46.846 --> 05:51.816
and it's your job to get it
out of him any way you can.

05:51.884 --> 05:55.052
You prod me one more time,
I'm gonna show you eight places

05:55.120 --> 05:58.156
you can beat a man
      and leave no marks.

05:58.223 --> 06:00.224
Aw, so what?
So what?

06:00.292 --> 06:02.627
So you're big,
so you're black,

06:02.694 --> 06:05.296
so you got a badge,
so you got a gun.

06:05.363 --> 06:07.198
I'm a dead man.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.135
Yeah. Thanks
for smiling, Captain.

06:11.203 --> 06:12.369
Sorry. Sorry.

06:12.437 --> 06:13.604
Come on, son.

06:13.739 --> 06:15.906
(whispers)
    Whoa. Close. This close.

06:20.045 --> 06:21.879
(knocking)

06:21.947 --> 06:23.781
MAN (on TV):
   ...weather when we return.

06:26.118 --> 06:27.785
Who is it?

06:27.853 --> 06:30.588
It's me, Terry, the
            kid from the garage.

06:30.656 --> 06:35.693
The one I established
    a liking for so quickly?

06:35.761 --> 06:37.194
I guess.

06:37.262 --> 06:39.363
Oh.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.199
Come in. Come in.

06:45.637 --> 06:48.572
How did you get away
from the police?

06:48.640 --> 06:51.075
Well, they said, "Go
        sit in that chair, kid."

06:51.143 --> 06:52.376
So I did.

06:52.444 --> 06:55.079
Then after a while, I
          got up and walked out.

06:55.147 --> 06:56.981
Was anybody hurt?

06:59.351 --> 07:01.252
Well, good.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.620
Wha-What are...

07:02.688 --> 07:03.855
What are you
                     doing here?

07:03.889 --> 07:05.556
I was looking for you.

07:05.623 --> 07:07.124
I hope you don't mind.

07:07.159 --> 07:08.860
No, uh, I don't.

07:08.927 --> 07:11.228
But how did
                    you find me?

07:11.296 --> 07:13.431
You're the only Jim Ignatowski
in the phone book.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.565
I know.

07:14.632 --> 07:16.133
Isn't it great?

07:16.201 --> 07:18.135
Yeah.

07:18.270 --> 07:21.272
Mr. Ignatowski,
I want to stay with you.

07:21.339 --> 07:22.573
Here?

07:22.641 --> 07:24.275
Oh, I don't know, Terry.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.943
I mean, look around you.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.411
What do you see?

07:29.647 --> 07:32.583
Ice cream, popcorn
    and television.

07:32.650 --> 07:33.817
Exactly.

07:33.886 --> 07:37.654
What kind of place
              is this for a kid?

07:37.722 --> 07:39.456
Please let me stay.

07:39.524 --> 07:42.193
I... I don't know, Terry.

07:42.261 --> 07:45.263
I'm not really set
              up here for a kid.

07:45.331 --> 07:49.100
I don't even
                     have Atari.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.402
Please.

07:51.470 --> 07:55.440
Is home such a
          terrible place, Terry?

07:55.507 --> 07:57.908
I hate the things
they make me do.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.011
Like what?

08:00.079 --> 08:03.214
What do your parents
      make you do, Terry?

08:03.249 --> 08:04.682
Lots of things.

08:04.750 --> 08:07.317
I have
   to keep my room tidied up.

08:07.386 --> 08:09.153
Oh, no!

08:11.056 --> 08:12.089
I can't ride my bike

08:12.157 --> 08:13.824
in any streets
     where there's traffic.

08:13.926 --> 08:16.294
(grunts)

08:16.362 --> 08:18.095
I can't even
watch television

08:18.163 --> 08:20.064
till every bit
of my homework's done.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.032
Terry.

08:22.100 --> 08:25.069
Terry!

08:25.137 --> 08:28.172
I'll never send you back
        to a hellhole like that!

08:38.683 --> 08:40.118
Well...
        (clears throat)

08:40.184 --> 08:42.854
Now that I'm awake
       and you're awake,

08:42.921 --> 08:45.523
why don't I fix us
        some breakfast?

08:45.590 --> 08:46.924
What have you got?

08:46.992 --> 08:48.859
Well, sir,

08:48.928 --> 08:51.296
we got...

08:51.363 --> 08:53.698
uh... chili!

08:53.766 --> 08:56.567
Terry...

08:56.635 --> 08:59.403
SpaghettiOs.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.740
I'm not that hungry.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.575
I had some potato chips

09:04.643 --> 09:06.744
and two boxes of cookies
        in my backpack.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.846
I ate 'em all before you got up.

09:08.914 --> 09:10.481
Good for you.

09:10.549 --> 09:12.183
After all,

09:12.251 --> 09:15.486
breakfast is the most
      important meal of the day.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.523
What are we gonna do now?

09:19.591 --> 09:20.791
Well,

09:20.826 --> 09:24.194
oh, let's... let's see.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.130
I know.

09:28.066 --> 09:30.367
Let's play catch.

09:30.435 --> 09:31.669
In the house?

09:31.736 --> 09:33.104
Yeah.
                    Wow!

09:33.172 --> 09:36.007
My parents would never let me
    play catch in the house.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.975
Mine, neither.

09:41.713 --> 09:43.714
Oops. Hey.

09:43.782 --> 09:45.049
(grunts)

09:48.486 --> 09:49.486
Huh.

09:54.693 --> 09:57.128
Well...

09:57.196 --> 09:59.864
Parents know a few things.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.200
I guess that
                      ends that.

10:03.268 --> 10:06.571
Well, that's the nice thing
          about catch.

10:06.638 --> 10:09.907
It doesn't have to be long,

10:09.975 --> 10:12.243
just so it's good.

10:14.379 --> 10:16.714
What else will we do?

10:16.782 --> 10:18.549
I don't know.

10:20.485 --> 10:22.419
You know,

10:22.487 --> 10:25.422
I've never been
a father before.

10:25.490 --> 10:28.325
I can experience
everything

10:28.393 --> 10:32.563
for the first time
through your eyes.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.766
I can't wait to
watch your face

10:35.834 --> 10:38.368
when you watch me shave.

10:38.437 --> 10:41.705
I can hardly wait
till next Thursday.

10:43.742 --> 10:46.577
I'm really gonna
like it here.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.879
Especially the part about
not having to go to school.

10:48.947 --> 10:53.183
Hey, who says you don't
have to go to school?

10:53.251 --> 10:55.419
School's very important.

10:55.487 --> 10:57.922
If I had dropped out
of grammar school,

10:57.990 --> 11:01.993
I'd never have been able
to drop out of college.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.295
Why don't you teach me, Jim?

11:04.363 --> 11:06.431
Teach me what you know.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.533
Well, that would take
         hours, Terry.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.501
Um...

11:12.905 --> 11:14.571
Well, I don't know.

11:14.639 --> 11:16.007
But what the heck.

11:16.074 --> 11:21.813
We've all got a little
     Obi-Wan Kenobi in us.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.914
Okay.

11:23.982 --> 11:25.015
(clears throat)

11:25.083 --> 11:27.885
Hey...

11:27.953 --> 11:33.424
if a tree falls
in the forest,

11:33.492 --> 11:37.161
and nobody is there
to hear it,

11:37.229 --> 11:38.862
does it make a sound?

11:41.767 --> 11:43.533
If a tree...

11:43.602 --> 11:45.435
...falls in the forest.

11:45.437 --> 11:47.805
Nobody's there.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.773
Is there a sound?

11:54.813 --> 11:56.046
I don't know.

11:56.114 --> 11:58.182
Of course there is.

11:58.249 --> 12:02.386
Don't let anybody fool you.

12:02.453 --> 12:04.755
People try to make
that complicated.

12:04.823 --> 12:07.658
If a tree falls,
there's a sound!

12:07.725 --> 12:10.560
The bigger the tree,
the bigger the sound.

12:10.628 --> 12:13.931
Okay, so much for philosophy.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.802
Next, morality.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.775
It's your parents'
anniversary.

12:26.211 --> 12:29.981
Your mother sends you with $15

12:30.048 --> 12:32.716
to get her dress
        at the tailor's.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.585
(clears throat)

12:34.653 --> 12:37.388
On your way there,

12:37.456 --> 12:41.559
a guy offers to sell you
   the last available ticket

12:41.627 --> 12:45.563
to a monster rock concert.

12:45.631 --> 12:50.301
The price is exactly $15.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.436
What do ya do?

12:57.709 --> 12:58.742
Well...

12:58.844 --> 13:00.911
Backstage passes included.

13:01.914 --> 13:03.780
That's easy.

13:03.882 --> 13:04.815
It's not my money.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.085
I'd get my
                 mother's dress.

13:08.153 --> 13:10.888
It was The Kinks.

13:15.594 --> 13:18.529
She could have worn
        the blue thing.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.900
But she trusted me.

13:22.968 --> 13:27.204
I'm giving you an "A"
in morality.

13:27.272 --> 13:31.576
Look, I gotta get to work,
but we've been terrific here.

13:31.643 --> 13:34.612
We covered philosophy,

13:34.680 --> 13:36.614
we covered morality.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.483
All the rest is
      just tinsel anyway.

13:39.551 --> 13:41.318
Tomorrow...

13:41.386 --> 13:43.053
we do history.

13:43.922 --> 13:45.589
The '60s,

13:45.657 --> 13:48.592
a misunderstood decade.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.663
Hey, am I crazy

13:52.731 --> 13:55.833
or are we having
     a fantastic time here?

13:55.901 --> 13:58.001
I think it's great
being here, Jim.

13:58.069 --> 14:00.938
Hey, you gonna be okay
           here if I go to work?

14:01.006 --> 14:03.941
I mean, you want
                     me to quit?

14:06.311 --> 14:08.045
No, I'll be fine, Jim.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.047
Okay.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.316
Anything I can do
to help out?

14:12.383 --> 14:15.152
Um, let's see, uh...

14:15.220 --> 14:17.154
maybe.

14:17.222 --> 14:21.125
Uh, there's a toolbox
                 in the bedroom.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.160
If you don't mind,

14:23.228 --> 14:26.163
will you get it out and
            re-grout the shower?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.767
I'll try.

14:31.670 --> 14:34.371
That's all anyone
                        can ask.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.207
(sighs)

14:41.913 --> 14:44.214
Yeah, I'll-I'll let you know
     just as soon as we...

14:44.282 --> 14:45.882
Right, okay.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.351
Bye.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.353
Oh, kids.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.355
(splutters)

14:51.423 --> 14:53.357
What about them?

14:53.425 --> 14:55.892
They make you laugh,
                     don't they?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.628
Yeah, sometimes.

14:57.696 --> 14:58.862
(clears throat)

14:58.930 --> 15:00.864
Take mine, for instance.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.502
Yours?

15:05.570 --> 15:06.837
Yeah.

15:06.904 --> 15:09.473
Ordinarily,
the little guy

15:09.541 --> 15:11.942
is just a pleasure
to live with.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.511
Jim, you don't
                     have a kid.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.244
Sure, I do.

15:14.313 --> 15:15.712
And I'll tell ya,

15:15.781 --> 15:18.415
he turns into a holy terror

15:18.483 --> 15:21.451
when it comes to washing
        behind the ears.

15:21.519 --> 15:24.955
Last night we went around
      and around about it.

15:25.023 --> 15:27.958
Finally I gave in and you know,

15:28.026 --> 15:31.361
it wasn't as bad as I thought.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.767
I might just start doing it
           regularly.

15:38.870 --> 15:41.605
Jim, what the hell are
              you talking about?

15:41.673 --> 15:43.741
Behind the ears here.
                       No.

15:43.775 --> 15:46.877
You take a wash...
              But, Jim-- but you
               don't have a kid.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.347
Yes, I do, Alex.

15:50.414 --> 15:53.683
I have adopted a son.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.485
Adopted?
                         ELAINE:
                            Jim?

15:55.553 --> 15:56.887
What are you talking about?

15:56.955 --> 15:58.154
It's, uh--

15:58.222 --> 16:01.124
it's a little difficult
to adopt a child, isn't it?

16:01.192 --> 16:03.193
Is this difficult?
       (snapping fingers)

16:05.397 --> 16:07.364
Jim, who is
                       this kid?

16:07.432 --> 16:09.699
Terry.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.002
Terry? You mean the kid that was
       in here yesterday?

16:12.037 --> 16:13.537
Uh-huh.
                        Terry...
But...

16:13.604 --> 16:15.973
But-but he's already
                    got parents.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.208
I didn't say there
    wouldn't be problems.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.242
No, no, no,
no, Jim,

16:19.310 --> 16:20.510
Jim?
              Huh?

16:20.579 --> 16:22.279
His parents are desperately
      trying to find him.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.181
They're camped out at the police
       station right now.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.951
The cops just called to ask
   if any of us had seen him.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.552
Jim...
   Huh?

16:28.619 --> 16:30.921
You cannot adopt
            somebody else's kid.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.090
He's not somebody
else's kid.

16:33.157 --> 16:34.958
He's my kid now.

16:35.026 --> 16:37.961
I made it-- I made it legal.

16:38.029 --> 16:40.730
I got him a library card.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.066
Iggy.
               Huh?

16:43.135 --> 16:45.269
I can't believe
      my ears.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.305
We're talkin' about
two loving parents

16:48.373 --> 16:50.440
who are desperately lookin'
     for that little tyke.

16:50.508 --> 16:53.243
It's our duty to sound them out
        about a reward.

16:53.311 --> 16:54.477
I shouldn't
                       have told

16:54.545 --> 16:56.246
any of you about this.

16:56.314 --> 16:57.914
You're trying to ruin it.

16:57.982 --> 16:59.049
LOUIE:
Money, money,

16:59.117 --> 17:00.518
money...
Now, now, now,
Jim, Jim...

17:00.585 --> 17:02.286
Jim, I don't understand... I
  don't understand something.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.954
What-what do you want
          with Terry?

17:05.022 --> 17:07.458
He's the son I never had.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.626
Yeah, well, he's the son
his parents do have.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.762
And you better get him
back to them. Fast.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.163
Iggy.
                       Yeah?

17:13.231 --> 17:15.132
You're sheltering a fugitive.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.866
No, it's not a question of that.

17:16.934 --> 17:18.535
Jim...

17:18.603 --> 17:20.403
his parents are worried sick.

17:20.471 --> 17:22.071
Jim, the cops called.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.473
They said his-his mother's
been crying

17:23.540 --> 17:24.842
for the last 24 hours.

17:24.909 --> 17:26.676
Oh, poor lady.
                    She's got it
                  coming to her.

17:26.744 --> 17:29.146
You should hear the
                 terrible things

17:29.213 --> 17:31.014
she's done to him.

17:31.082 --> 17:33.750
Forcing him to take
                  piano lessons,

17:33.818 --> 17:36.486
sending him off to camp
          every summer

17:36.554 --> 17:39.489
as if he was a-a camper.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.594
The kid has a home.

17:44.629 --> 17:46.596
He's got a family.

17:46.631 --> 17:48.365
He's got a puppy.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.168
He has a puppy?

17:52.937 --> 17:54.204
You...

17:54.272 --> 17:56.073
you know that
                     for a fact?

17:56.141 --> 17:58.942
A little spotted puppy

17:59.010 --> 18:01.945
who's just sitting around
now pining away

18:02.013 --> 18:03.947
wondering where
his Terry is,

18:04.015 --> 18:06.449
tears welling up
in his little brown eyes.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.586
I don't believe you're
                      doing this

18:08.653 --> 18:10.621
when you don't
                  know for sure.

18:10.688 --> 18:13.624
Jim, the puppy
won't eat.

18:15.393 --> 18:17.294
This is emotional
                      blackmail.

18:19.297 --> 18:20.897
The puppy's name
is Snowball.

18:20.965 --> 18:22.899
Oh!

18:22.967 --> 18:25.902
Because of all the
white, fluffy fur

18:25.970 --> 18:28.005
from his little paws
to his cute little tail.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.806
(moaning)

18:29.874 --> 18:31.975
(mimicking puppy
yelping)
                     No, no.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.778
Okay, okay, okay, I'll
                  send him back.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.180
Oh, great, great, Jim.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.482
JIM:
                I'll go break it
                     to him now.

18:38.550 --> 18:39.816
I'll get his parents
      and bring 'em over.

18:39.884 --> 18:41.718
Hey, Jim, uh, listen,

18:41.786 --> 18:44.221
I'm-I'm sorry you
                have to do this.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.223
(sighing)

18:46.291 --> 18:48.658
It's okay, Alex.

18:48.726 --> 18:52.029
It's just not gonna be easy

18:52.097 --> 18:55.065
explaining to a ten-year-old boy

18:55.133 --> 18:57.835
that he's not adopted.

19:10.081 --> 19:12.349
Hey, Jim, I made you lunch.

19:13.284 --> 19:16.286
SpaghettiOs!

19:16.354 --> 19:19.289
My favorite.

19:19.357 --> 19:20.758
How did you know?

19:20.825 --> 19:23.560
You had 44 cans of it.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.330
After you eat, maybe
we could play catch again.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.399
No.

19:29.467 --> 19:31.302
Well...

19:31.369 --> 19:33.303
I don't think so.

19:33.471 --> 19:35.272
Or we could just watch TV.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.541
Terry...

19:37.576 --> 19:39.409
Terry...

19:41.912 --> 19:44.848
Your parents are
                coming over,

19:44.915 --> 19:47.417
and you're going
            back with them.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.386
No! No!

19:50.655 --> 19:52.790
No!

19:52.857 --> 19:53.724
Terry!
(door slams)

19:53.792 --> 19:55.625
Te...
              (knocking on door)

19:55.693 --> 19:56.393
Jim.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.861
Oh, Jim.
Alex!

19:57.929 --> 19:59.296
Yeah, listen, Jim.
I've been thinking
this over.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.231
Jim, these are Terry's
                        parents.

20:01.299 --> 20:03.567
Mr. and Mrs. Booth, uh,
    this is Jim Ignatowski,

20:03.635 --> 20:06.102
the man who was kind enough
      to take your son in,
     Hi.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.804
and, uh, take care of him
      until you got here.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.707
Oh, thank you,
                 Mr. Ignatowski.

20:09.774 --> 20:11.942
You'll never know how
                grateful we are.

20:12.043 --> 20:12.710
You're a good man.
     Yes.

20:12.844 --> 20:13.977
Where's my son?

20:14.044 --> 20:14.778
Why?

20:14.879 --> 20:16.846
Is it time to tidy up his room?

20:19.618 --> 20:23.053
He'll be here in plenty of time
        for summer camp.

20:23.121 --> 20:24.788
Don't worry.
Uh, uh...

20:25.657 --> 20:26.923
...excuse us
for a minute.

20:26.991 --> 20:28.391
Jim, come here.

20:28.459 --> 20:30.828
(whispering):
Jim, what are you doing?

20:30.895 --> 20:33.964
I just don't know what
               to do here, Alex.

20:34.099 --> 20:35.833
I can't go back
                     on my word.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.802
I promised Terry I would
            never send him back.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.738
Believe me, he really doesn't
    want to see them again.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.974
If he knew they were here,

20:44.041 --> 20:46.643
he'd probably be out
  on the fire escape right now

20:46.711 --> 20:48.144
making a run for it.

20:48.212 --> 20:48.979
Come on, Terry.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.814
We have your puppy
                     in the car.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.950
See ya, Jim. Thanks!

20:53.018 --> 20:54.517
JIM:
I just don't know
how I'm gonna face him

20:54.585 --> 20:57.654
when he discovers that
          they've found him out.

20:57.721 --> 21:00.123
Yeah, well, Jim, I wouldn't
worry about that right now.

21:00.191 --> 21:01.925
Thanks again, Mr. Ignatowski.

21:01.993 --> 21:04.361
You're a very special person.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.697
(door closes)

21:09.200 --> 21:11.134
The kid's gone?

21:11.202 --> 21:12.803
He said good-bye.
You missed it.

21:12.870 --> 21:13.970
Go-go after him.

21:14.038 --> 21:15.939
Uh...

21:16.007 --> 21:17.941
uh...

21:18.009 --> 21:19.943
No, no.

21:20.011 --> 21:23.613
Uh, grownups make
         too big a fuss

21:23.682 --> 21:25.615
out of good-byes.

21:25.684 --> 21:27.650
I used to hate it.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.620
"Say good-bye
     to your Uncle Harry."

21:32.456 --> 21:34.390
"Good-bye, Uncle Harry."

21:35.927 --> 21:37.961
"Good-bye, Jim."
            (grunts)

21:39.998 --> 21:43.934
Look, Jim, you did
        the right thing.

21:44.002 --> 21:45.936
You know that, don't you?

21:46.004 --> 21:47.938
Ah...

21:48.006 --> 21:49.806
I guess so.

21:56.581 --> 21:57.781
You okay, Jim?

21:57.849 --> 21:59.716
Yeah.

21:59.784 --> 22:02.686
But my life will never
       be the same again.

22:02.787 --> 22:06.022
Oh, come on, Jim, the kid was
      only here overnight.

22:06.090 --> 22:07.924
(sighs)

22:09.994 --> 22:12.763
Well, uh,

22:12.831 --> 22:14.832
I don't know, I, uh...

22:14.899 --> 22:16.800
Alex...
                           Yeah?

22:19.103 --> 22:21.371
Since I didn't have a chance

22:21.439 --> 22:24.040
to say good-bye to him,

22:24.108 --> 22:27.110
can I say good-bye to you?

22:27.178 --> 22:28.878
Me?

22:28.947 --> 22:30.414
Yeah, sure.

22:30.448 --> 22:31.581
Why not?

22:38.423 --> 22:41.257
You don't have to call...

22:41.326 --> 22:44.260
you don't have to write.

22:45.330 --> 22:48.665
All I ask is
that you remember me.

22:54.405 --> 22:58.207
Yeah, okay, right.

23:00.178 --> 23:02.111
(moaning)

23:04.649 --> 23:09.052
How can you make a simple thing
      so heart-wrenching?

23:09.120 --> 23:11.888
I feel awful.

23:11.956 --> 23:13.857
I can't leave now.

23:16.360 --> 23:19.163
Well, you want to stay
           for lunch?

23:21.266 --> 23:23.167
Yeah, what're you havin'?

23:23.268 --> 23:25.602
Uh, SpaghettiOs,

23:25.703 --> 23:27.937
popcorn and herring.

23:32.676 --> 23:34.644
See you in the garage,
                      Jim, okay?

23:48.660 --> 23:52.763
No matter how many leave
           the nest,

23:52.830 --> 23:55.299
it never gets any easier.

24:03.475 --> 24:06.075
(theme song playing)

24:29.133 --> 24:30.567
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:30.635 --> 24:31.635
(man grumbling)

24:32.305 --> 24:38.172
