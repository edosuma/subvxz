00:01.000 --> 00:02.333
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:04.460
You're safe here
amongst your sisters.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.622
- My name is Wynonna Earp.
- The heir.

00:08.634 --> 00:11.593
Sorry I didn't tell you about
stupid Bobo's stupid powers.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.220
Looking for this?
Thought you were just happy to see me.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.129
I am finished here, Waverly.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.721
- This was your plan?
- You told me to learn to drive.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.760
I didn't mean
leave Purgatory without a word!

00:20.938 --> 00:23.055
You came back.
I knew our connection was real.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.774
- What the hell was that?
- The impossible.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.901
Would you girls
kindly get your butts in here?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.437
Willa.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.329
How much propofol
did Dolls give her?

00:40.499 --> 00:41.990
Enough to calm her down.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.020
I thought she was gonna
hyperventilate to death.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.660
Yeah, I know how she feels.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.375
How can a woman recently sprung
from a hippie forest cult...

00:48.549 --> 00:50.586
Be our big sister Willa?

00:50.759 --> 00:53.251
I don't know her at all.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.590
Dude, none of us do.
How do you think she feels?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.256
She doesn't even know
she's herself, Wynonna, so...

00:58.433 --> 01:00.641
Girls, please.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.303
I know this is all overwhelming,

01:03.480 --> 01:05.938
but it's also a second chance.

01:06.108 --> 01:09.442
Good Lord! The whole town
will be upended.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.477
We can't tell anyone.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.146
Not until we know for sure.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.075
It's about damn time.

"Blah-blah-blah-blah,
in conclusion, 44 markers tested"

01:31.842 --> 01:33.602
"with a sibling index

01:33.635 --> 01:35.422
"and indicated by these data..."

01:37.180 --> 01:38.921
You're sure?

01:39.099 --> 01:42.342
I mean,
science doesn't lie, right?

01:42.519 --> 01:45.182
But nobody knows
whose saliva sample this is

01:45.355 --> 01:47.438
or that you were comparing it
to mine, right?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.315
Her being here
could be dangerous.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.421
Hey, don't worry. Black Badge
doesn't know anything, OK?

01:51.445 --> 01:53.528
Plus I got a buddy
down in the forensics lab

01:53.697 --> 01:56.360
who did
a no-questions-asked favour.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.618
But you don't believe me.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.699
Only the part
about you having a buddy.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.073
If she really is
our long-lost sister, then...

02:06.251 --> 02:08.116
Technically, she's the heir.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.163
Or an heir. Then, there'd be
both of you. Two of you.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.127
I was gonna say,
if she really is Willa,

02:13.300 --> 02:16.168
then we stopped looking for her
a long time ago,

02:16.345 --> 02:18.052
and we're really horrible people, but...

02:21.850 --> 02:22.966
Eve.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.892
- Eve, it's OK, you're safe.
- It was real, wasn't it?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.772
I killed a man.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.604
Lou got pulled into the ground.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.275
He didn't get pulled into the ground.
You sent him to hell.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.945
- Hell?
- Well, she did.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.279
I-I think I should go.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.072
Whoa, you can't go anywhere.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.706
Sorry.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.040
Excuse me, I don't want
to be rude, but I don't know...

02:51.213 --> 02:53.421
any of you.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.424
- Or what's happening.
- Here, have a drink.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.131
- I don't drink.
- You will.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.261
'Cause according to

03:01.431 --> 03:04.390
the fresh-out-of-the-oven
DNA test, you...

03:06.269 --> 03:07.851
are officially an Earp.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.101
Welcome home, Willa.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.234
Now, Zed, don't, as in do not,

03:23.412 --> 03:24.778
make eye contact with them.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.742
They've been in storage
for about a year.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.451
- They'll be hungry.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.065
You need help
with those boltcutters,

03:30.210 --> 03:31.792
or should I stand here all day?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.513
- Hello!
- Help me!

03:47.686 --> 03:50.554
The boss will be real mad
if we don't get what he needs.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.141
Please help!

04:02.159 --> 04:04.276
Oh, shit! There's something
wrong with 'em.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.196
Maybe they're sick.
Come on, Zed.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.329
Jesus, what happened to you?

04:13.170 --> 04:15.913
That's what people will ask you.
If you survive.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.375
Shut your eyes, Zed!

04:17.548 --> 04:19.836
Oh! Take me.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.297
- I think I'm in love.
- That'll change.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.784
This is...

04:55.796 --> 04:57.458
was my bedroom?

04:57.631 --> 05:01.545
Yeah. Dolls thought this might
activate some memories.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.386
Looks like I liked horses.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.299
I guess every little girl
likes horses.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.342
No, I didn't.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.557
They don't like me.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.643
I remember him. Mr Plumpkins.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.809
Poor guy is missing an eye.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.066
Yeah.

05:20.237 --> 05:23.275
My big sister used to steal him
and torture him for ransom.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.940
- Alright, my bad.
- Not you.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.534
All this time I was missing...

05:29.704 --> 05:31.320
our parents never redecorated?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.990
Mom was already long gone
by then, and Daddy...

05:36.503 --> 05:38.290
had passed.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.584
Anything memory-wise?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.548
A switchblade.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.468
What kind of people
give a kid a switchblade?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.807
Unless I was dangerous.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.432
More like... special.

06:04.739 --> 06:08.073
I think... I'll take a shower.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.075
- Is that OK?
- Yeah, of course.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.407
This is your home, Willa.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.665
Oh, it's... It's just called...

06:15.834 --> 06:18.952
free living. Au naturel.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.586
It's groovy.

06:26.261 --> 06:29.004
She hates us.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.513
She doesn't know us.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.515
Uh, gotta go.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.392
Yeah, I said I'd see Nicole.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.306
- Before the Poker Spectacular.
- You best friends now?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.727
And what the hell
is a Poker Spectacular?

06:43.904 --> 06:47.238
Stuck in Purgatory for another
goddamn Poker Spectacular.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.616
There was a whore I knew,
used to poke her spectacular.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.653
I find my lead out there,

06:53.830 --> 06:55.766
I don't have to listen
to your goddamn awful jokes

06:55.790 --> 06:57.497
in here again.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.158
Concentrate, Del Rey.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.249
I got six whales coming into town.
A lot of cash.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.913
They expect a certain type
of service.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.252
A certain level
of sophistication.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.169
Details I certainly don't care about,
you pompous twat.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.212
Suddenly you don't care
about making money?

07:11.389 --> 07:12.755
What do I care for money?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.674
In four more days,
I'll be in the wind.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.013
You say that every year.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.849
Cryderman.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.689
Got it for you,
like I said I would.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.818
A small taste of things to come.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.655
Hello, babies.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.916
- I'll need more than this.
- On the way.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.874
- You lock up law enforcement?
- Don't I always?

07:44.047 --> 07:46.380
- What about Black Badge?
- I'm handling it.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.881
I promise.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.543
I put a lot of stake
in a man's word, Cryderman.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.837
But I no longer find
the exploits of Wynonna Earp

07:53.014 --> 07:55.301
and Deputy Marshall Dolls
particularly entertaining.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.684
- Speaking of entertainment...
- The twins - locked and loaded.

07:58.853 --> 08:02.187
You want your Johnson serviced
before we part ways?

08:02.357 --> 08:06.101
Nice try. I'll see myself out.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.573
Sad Bobo
is my least favourite Bobo.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.825
Is there anything we can do
to make it better, baby?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.577
Not my types.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.237
Then again...

08:19.249 --> 08:21.036
it is goddamn Poker Spectacular.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.916
Why not?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.217
No teeth.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.354
Mr Stokes, welcome to
my humble little town.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.143
With this high a buy-in, Judge,

08:49.320 --> 08:50.902
I don't think
humble will cut it.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.655
What's a high-stakes poker game
without the stakes?

08:53.825 --> 08:55.782
All cash then?

08:56.828 --> 08:59.161
I'm gonna check into my hotel,
relax a little bit

08:59.330 --> 09:01.037
before the games begin.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.167
I made sure you were
in our most prestigious room.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.668
- It's to die for.
- I'll be the judge of that.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.293
How is this even possible?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.132
I still can't believe it.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.173
Feels like a piece that's been
missing from our lives.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.301
And now it's back.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.265
Last time I saw her,

09:23.438 --> 09:25.930
she was being pulled out
a window.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.973
I didn't do a damn thing.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.733
You mean 'couldn't'.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.986
We shouldn't have given up, Gus.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.112
But we didn't think we had.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.569
After six months of searching...

09:38.328 --> 09:40.069
we found part
of Willa's nightgown

09:40.246 --> 09:41.862
coated in dried blood.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.408
- Oh, Jesus.
- Well, it was a Thursday.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.121
I remember,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.231
'cause you'd just been released
from St Victoria's.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.043
Tried to burn down
your classroom.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.085
Ms Hanson called my diorama
an aberration.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.840
Stayed up all night

09:58.014 --> 10:00.301
handcrafting those little
papier-mâché demons.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.516
This is crazy.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.727
You don't look a miracle
in the mouth, Wy.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.436
This could heal us all.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.476
We need to get
her memories back,

10:12.654 --> 10:15.146
and I don't have a magic pill
for that.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.189
You could start
by telling me the truth.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.279
I did.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.536
The whole truth.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.548
Oh, I'd hate to see
their second best, hm?

11:11.337 --> 11:14.250
- What the f...
- We've been waiting for you.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.915
It's been so long

11:16.092 --> 11:18.084
since we've had a man.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.968
A real man.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.974
Oh, hello!

11:30.148 --> 11:32.640
Oh! Oh!

11:32.817 --> 11:36.731
Oh, that feels amazing!

11:39.407 --> 11:41.490
That's... that's a little tight.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.950
Shhhh, baby.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.206
It'll all be over soon.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.037
We gotta get this to Bobo.
Hurry up.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.498
Coming.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.833
Arggh!

11:56.007 --> 11:57.714
Ugh!

12:00.803 --> 12:02.590
Demons?

12:02.764 --> 12:04.756
Like Beelzebub and Lucifer?

12:04.933 --> 12:06.265
Hell, no.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.393
Hell yes, apparently.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.098
And that's where they come from?

12:11.272 --> 12:13.889
And where we send 'em back.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.810
These revenants are the bad guys
Wyatt Earp put down.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.727
When they resurrect...

12:18.905 --> 12:20.862
they come back demon-adjacent.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.694
With powers.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.363
Are there any angels?

12:26.412 --> 12:30.156
Sure. Snow, Charlie's and Los.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.199
How can you think this is funny?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.709
How can you not?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.585
This curse, our burden -

12:35.755 --> 12:38.589
if you don't laugh
you'll go crazy.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.671
And I've been crazy.
Didn't care for it.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.052
You hate having to do this.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.930
What would it make me
if I didn't?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.104
Here's the kicker.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.607
I was never supposed
to be hunting revenants

12:56.776 --> 12:58.517
or breaking curses.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.359
It was supposed to be you.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.003
Daddy, it's four in the morning,
and I have school tomorrow.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.084
Every one
of your little classmates

13:20.258 --> 13:22.545
will be slaughtered
if you don't learn to protect them.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.802
This town. Your sisters.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.678
Now aim!

13:26.848 --> 13:29.932
Don't hesitate.
Because they sure won't.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.426
- DO IT!
- Ah!

13:34.522 --> 13:35.808
Are you OK?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.848
Daddy.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.691
Gus. Wave... Waverly.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.654
Nona.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.656
I remember you!

13:51.247 --> 13:54.240
- You're a brunette now.
- Look who's talking!

13:56.336 --> 13:58.794
Willa, do you remember
what happened after you were taken?

13:58.963 --> 14:01.831
No. Just... just being kids.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.377
And Daddy training me
to be the heir.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.230
Wynonna, where the hell
have I been?

14:18.399 --> 14:19.981
Hey, Earp.

14:20.151 --> 14:23.519
Oh, uh... Wynonna Earp.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.779
Yeah, we got something.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.735
I'll be OK.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.492
It's fine. Go.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.374
So breakthrough? Revelations?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.251
She had flashes of training
with Daddy

14:40.421 --> 14:41.832
when she fired 'Peacemaker'.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.248
- Is she a good shot?
- You mean, better than me?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.373
Well, if you're as ornery

15:18.543 --> 15:20.785
with your car
as you are with strangers,

15:20.962 --> 15:23.079
I can see why the engine
quit on you.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.872
Oh, you say ornery.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.585
I say vigilant.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.297
Well, seeing as you're not dead

15:29.470 --> 15:32.634
or looking for help,
I'll be on my way.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.851
Now, hold on!

15:38.020 --> 15:39.682
You know cars?

15:39.856 --> 15:43.020
Yeah, I tinker here and there.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.068
- Shit!
- What?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.480
Well, that, on my maiden trek,

15:49.657 --> 15:52.525
my horse should go
hooves up exactly here.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.778
You're a strange fella,
aren't you?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.072
Been told I have character.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.833
Carrying a flask of Tabasco
on your hip is character.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.915
Drawing a pistol
on a good Samaritan,

16:04.088 --> 16:05.954
that's just being a dick.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.758
Do you think you can assist

16:09.927 --> 16:12.010
with my vehicle, please?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.887
I am stranded.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.800
Alright. Try starting her up.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.765
Well, see, here's the clinker -

16:20.938 --> 16:22.850
I got angry,
I threw them keys away.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.811
Now, I looked for 'em
for a spell,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.852
but then I decided tired eyes,
they're poor tools, so...

16:28.863 --> 16:31.025
And which direction
did you throw 'em?

16:31.199 --> 16:33.191
Just past that marker.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.233
Uh-huh.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.007
Oh, I found them!

16:57.183 --> 17:00.267
Yeah, you sure did, son.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.106
This mean you'll help me?

17:11.906 --> 17:14.193
Oh, where are my manners?

17:15.867 --> 17:17.200
Henry.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.487
Mm-hm.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.961
You kept my death certificate.

17:28.130 --> 17:31.714
Yeah. To remind myself
it was actually real.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.592
You know,
that you were actually gone.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.218
I was six, right?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.224
I saw the little white coffin,

17:41.394 --> 17:44.137
but I knew that you weren't
actually in there.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.225
They'd filled it with sandbags.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.480
Was it a nice service?

17:50.653 --> 17:54.897
All I remember
was a lot of crying.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.575
And the food.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.572
The grown-ups let me eat
as many marshmallows

18:02.748 --> 18:04.080
as I wanted.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.492
I threw up all night long.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.166
Gee.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.753
That must have been
so hard for you.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.592
I'm sorry. It's just...

18:19.765 --> 18:21.097
It's really intense.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.851
You guys killed me.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.314
What did you bury
in Daddy's coffin?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.145
Daddy.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.865
Arggh! Arggh!

18:47.627 --> 18:50.870
- Did you remember something?
- Oh, I feel faint.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.459
Are you scared of me?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.558
Willa!

19:12.735 --> 19:14.192
Willa...

19:17.657 --> 19:19.774
Alright, so Nedley
caught a scene at the hotel.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.942
Blood everywhere, but no body.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.405
Cool.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.912
Yeah, so the only thing left
was a laptop

19:26.082 --> 19:28.369
belonging to a guy
by the name of Bradley Stokes.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.159
- Hedge-fund type from Seattle.
- Hm, cool.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.583
Nicole searched
for any connected devices

19:34.757 --> 19:36.498
and came across
an active smart watch

19:36.676 --> 19:39.293
currently transmitting
from this abandoned railyard.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.302
And let me guess.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.218
You cool? Now, you snap
out of it, alright?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.884
Yeah, I wonder what's
got me so distracted, right?

19:47.061 --> 19:49.769
Look, the guy may still
be alive in there,

19:49.939 --> 19:51.579
and I'm gonna need your help,
OK, Wynonna?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.473
Come on!

19:53.651 --> 19:55.688
You're the Earp
that I need right now.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.487
Try the only one
who'll fall for your bullshit.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.283
Alright, so the smart watch
is transmitting from in there.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.422
What?

20:17.591 --> 20:19.674
Daddy trained Willa.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.176
She was prepared to do this.

20:21.345 --> 20:24.008
Unlike me, the off-key drunk
of an understudy.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.218
Whoa, whoa, look,
you know you're good at this,

20:26.392 --> 20:28.054
and you're only getting better, OK?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.638
Thanks.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.581
Now, maybe what you're
really freaked out about

20:31.605 --> 20:33.392
is just getting replaced.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.775
From hero to punch-worthy
in 10 seconds flat.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.060
Shh.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.604
Save your punching
for what's in there.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.568
Gun. Now.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.703
Clear. Go.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.079
You go that way,
I go this way, got it?

21:29.747 --> 21:31.558
Honey, I'm flattered,
but for a whack of reasons

21:31.582 --> 21:33.164
you're not my type.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.336
- Stupid sexy hair porn!
- Earp! You good?

21:38.506 --> 21:40.919
I'm OK, but there's definitely
something in here, Dolls!

21:43.344 --> 21:45.427
Should have kept your pants on.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.847
Oh, shit.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.555
Ugly word
from such a beautiful man.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.098
Oh, wow!

21:59.318 --> 22:00.900
You're one of a kind.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.320
Close.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.274
Ah!

22:18.546 --> 22:21.755
You kiss different.
You're powerful.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.340
Whatever that is, way down deep,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.506
just let it out, baby.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.549
- I try so hard not to.
- Mm!

22:32.726 --> 22:34.558
- I want him.
- You got the banker.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.596
Yeah, but this one's
a rare bird.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.139
He likes me better!

22:39.316 --> 22:41.933
- I'm prettier.
- Yo, Ms Congeniality!

22:42.945 --> 22:44.231
Ugh!

22:45.239 --> 22:47.196
Nothing a facelift won't fix.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.409
- Wake up, Hugh Hefner.
- I taste strawberries.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.115
You smell of man-whore.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.372
- Where are those girls?
- Here.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.455
- One got away.
- I can lure the other one back.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.628
Ew.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.204
Right. Go.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.427
Hey, love.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.089
Don't be scared.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.223
Why don't we just finish
what we started?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.350
There you go.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.512
There you go.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.944
So...

23:30.075 --> 23:32.237
What is a pretty girl like you

23:32.411 --> 23:35.700
going around attacking men
like me?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.829
A favour.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.744
Judge wanted to cash in,

23:42.922 --> 23:45.505
and we get hungry
being all alone.

23:48.302 --> 23:49.838
Hungry for?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.594
I could just eat you up.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.149
Nice. We double-teamed her.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.185
Mm-hm.

24:07.363 --> 24:10.151
Any idea why the vampire twins
went after Stokes?

24:10.324 --> 24:12.281
Yeah, well, she said
"the judge".

24:14.453 --> 24:16.069
Yo.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.533
Wave, slow down.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.165
Shit! Willa took off.
She's gone.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.294
I sure appreciate your care.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.376
Well, I looked in my truck,

24:27.549 --> 24:31.293
and it just so happened
that I had a fan belt for a '78.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.177
This is your lucky day, son.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.680
Oh, I try and make my own luck.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.057
Well, you can't fix
your own car.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.846
You kids today and your iPodes
and your Netpix.

24:43.023 --> 24:46.016
You couldn't find a spark plug
if your life depended on it.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.070
I do like your hat, though.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.071
Much obliged.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.949
So where are you headed?

24:55.119 --> 24:56.485
Ooh, wherever suits me.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.449
I've always been
a bit of a drifter.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.454
Suppose some find that

25:00.624 --> 25:02.661
something to be proud of.

25:02.835 --> 25:07.330
My experience says drifting's
just another word for running.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.997
Running ain't in my nature.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.508
Well, maybe it didn't use to be,
but enough time in the dark...

25:12.678 --> 25:16.046
- a man can change.
- What did you say?

25:17.057 --> 25:19.390
- Or maybe it's a woman.
- Well, it ain't!

25:24.481 --> 25:26.939
You ever spend any time at war, son?

25:27.109 --> 25:29.396
My father did a long time ago.
You?

25:29.570 --> 25:31.277
On my first tour of duty,

25:31.447 --> 25:33.063
I couldn't wait to get home.

25:34.074 --> 25:37.192
When I did I couldn't figure out
what to do with myself.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.951
So I went back...

25:39.121 --> 25:42.114
to the desert.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.873
Nothing hollows out a man

25:44.043 --> 25:45.705
quicker than completing
a mission.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.999
Because after that...

25:50.174 --> 25:52.632
you still gotta live.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.963
Dig into that toolbox
and fetch me

25:55.137 --> 25:56.719
a 5H socket, would you?

26:02.311 --> 26:04.143
When did you finally give it up?

26:05.147 --> 26:06.604
I didn't.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.520
Neither have you, Doc.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.488
I really need to start
drinking less.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.529
Or much, much more.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.578
Hot chocolate?

26:27.836 --> 26:29.543
What are you playing at?

26:29.713 --> 26:31.295
I'm not sure what you mean, son.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.673
How in hell did you get this?

26:33.842 --> 26:35.583
Why? Is it something to you?

26:35.761 --> 26:38.754
This is Wyatt Earp's deputy badge.
He gave this to me.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.672
And I threw it in a fire

26:40.849 --> 26:43.216
many weeks ago, far from here.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.476
Sounds to me
like you were done with it.

26:45.646 --> 26:49.014
No more bullshit.
Now, who are you?

26:49.191 --> 26:50.773
Who sent you?

26:54.905 --> 26:58.398
Questions
with complicated answers.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.489
For simplicity's sake,

27:02.663 --> 27:05.246
you can call me Juan Carlo.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.452
And nobody sent me.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.413
I just am.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.249
Well, if not a revenant,
then what?

27:13.257 --> 27:15.590
You keep asking
all the wrong questions.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.421
But then again, most people do.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.335
What am I even doing here?

27:19.513 --> 27:21.254
That's more like it.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.431
My associates and I

27:24.601 --> 27:26.558
have a vested interest
in what you call

27:26.728 --> 27:28.765
the Ghost River Triangle.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.852
You only have four days
until winter solstice.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.517
Well, then, I'll be sure
to raise a glass of spiked cider

27:34.695 --> 27:36.687
to your enigmatic ass.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.481
Four days until the door opens.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.196
And if it does,
she will lose, Doc,

27:42.369 --> 27:45.237
even with your help.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.326
You have to choose.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.957
Keep drifting on down the road

27:50.127 --> 27:51.993
or face the darkness again,

27:52.171 --> 27:55.039
this time with Wynonna Earp
at your side.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.958
Not everyone
gets a second chance.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.218
Most of them stay in the ground.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.338
Well, I ought to put you
in the ground.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.972
Well...

28:07.561 --> 28:09.427
That'd be a choice too.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.972
Speaking of...

28:12.149 --> 28:14.516
You can take the fan belt...

28:14.693 --> 28:16.730
or the badge...

28:16.904 --> 28:18.816
but you can't have both.

28:22.409 --> 28:23.695
What were you thinking,

28:23.869 --> 28:25.610
showing Willa
her own scrapbook of death?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.653
She was curious.
Wouldn't you be curious?

28:27.831 --> 28:30.448
- Well, it freaked her out!
- Yeah, more like pissed her off.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.576
I wish Doc were here.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.545
He bailed on me, on... us.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.499
But he's a hell of a tracker.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.962
Yeah, good point.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.469
How are we gonna find a girl
we know nothing about?

28:43.639 --> 28:46.552
Half-price drinks
at Shorty's slash Bobo's.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.682
What is that musk ox playing at?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.186
Hey, you think?

28:52.356 --> 28:53.813
She is an Earp.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.644
Bet she drinks 'em dry
in 20 minutes.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.353
Why not?

29:05.369 --> 29:07.031
Well, ain't you pretty
as a peach.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.571
Can I buy the peach a drink?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.535
I don't even know what I like.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.870
I was living in a cult
in the woods.

29:14.044 --> 29:17.913
We drank tea
made from dandelions.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.423
Darlin', that's weird.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.005
Barkeep, send up some shots.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.178
- What are you having?
- One of everything you got.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.770
I hate when I'm right.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.602
What? You love it
when you're right.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.607
I meant sober.
I hate when I'm sober.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.359
Oh!

29:40.529 --> 29:42.191
Well, no sign of Bobo at least.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.855
Well, let's not wait on him.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.820
We should go soon.
We'll have to get out of here fast.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.735
Yeah, I'm gonna go get
the jeep ready.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.074
Wait a minute. Do you know Lou?

29:51.248 --> 29:53.661
Oh, my God!
You're one of them, aren't you?

29:53.834 --> 29:55.200
An exit. Find one.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.787
You shouldn't be here.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.455
And you shouldn't
have shot our daddy.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.213
I was gonna tell you. In time.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.504
I did what I thought was best.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.138
You were trying to save us.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.015
Maybe he deserved it.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.728
Willa!

30:13.812 --> 30:15.724
He told me I had nothing
to worry about,

30:15.897 --> 30:18.059
to just stay calm.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.725
He knew the attack was coming,
Wynonna.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.776
I don't remember anything else,

30:25.949 --> 30:27.656
except that our daddy
let those bad men

30:27.826 --> 30:30.489
come into our house,
tear us apart.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.827
Whores.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.457
I thought I told you to leave.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.494
You and your
bitch friend owe me a drink.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.434
- Wynonna!
- Give me back my gun!

30:54.603 --> 30:57.767
- I think you mean MY gun.
- There are real people here!

30:57.939 --> 30:59.271
Real regular human people.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.524
And how do we deal
with the non-regular ones?

31:01.693 --> 31:02.979
The old-fashioned way.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.530
- You OK?
- Yeah.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.699
Just like cow tipping
on Wilson's half acre.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.583
I'll take your word for it.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.587
That was amazing!

31:26.760 --> 31:28.171
Yeah.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.302
And Dolls is gonna kill us.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.555
I'll put the kettle on.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.520
Shit, that felt good!

31:43.693 --> 31:45.730
Yeah, so does BASE-jumping
without a chute.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.882
I'm sorry, maybe I'm unclear
about this whole curse thing.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.989
There are revenants,
there are Earps.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.694
The Earps - that's us,
by the way...

31:51.868 --> 31:52.699
Willa...

31:52.869 --> 31:55.077
make sure all the revenants
get a bullet to the brain

31:55.247 --> 31:56.738
from 'Peacemaker',
or die trying.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.248
- Am I missing something?
- Yeah. Civilians.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.020
And as far as human witnesses
are concerned,

32:01.044 --> 32:02.785
you just shot a random person
in a bar.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.875
In Purgatory, that's old news.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.448
That type of thing
can get Purgatory

32:06.591 --> 32:07.923
on the wrong side of the nuke.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.755
She didn't know.
I made the same mistake.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.547
Wynonna, why are you listening
to this buzzkill in army boots?

32:13.723 --> 32:15.555
- Buzzkill?
- Yeah.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.058
I'm a US Marshal
with Black Badge, you hear me?

32:18.228 --> 32:19.560
He's been helping us.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.891
You're following his orders
and not your own instincts.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.682
- Oh, come on.
- We're a team.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.193
I thought
I was the brainwashed one.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.202
Great.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.159
I'm her sister.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.869
I got it.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.514
Wynonna?

33:06.902 --> 33:08.564
I'm so, so sorry.

33:08.737 --> 33:11.980
I... I don't even know
who that person was.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.695
Pretty sure that was an Earp.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.787
Dolls was right.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.539
I lost control.

33:22.709 --> 33:26.328
I was angry
at everything, everyone.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.997
I let it in my head.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.876
At least you didn't have a meltdown
in front of your boss.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.008
Gummy bears.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.176
Fuzzy Peaches.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.266
I remember we used to play
in here with gummy bears.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.023
We would dance them across
the beams and into our mouths.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.566
Then you turned 11
and you wanted to practise

33:52.739 --> 33:54.105
making out with the gummy bears.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.363
Oh!

33:55.534 --> 33:57.947
And you promised
to never tell anyone that.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.826
I never did.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.572
Then you went and died on me.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.741
We were two peas, you and I.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.369
It's always been you and I.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.708
Yeah, I remember.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.458
It can be like it always was.

34:14.636 --> 34:17.925
And different too,
in all the right ways.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.007
You're not alone anymore.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.065
Are you gonna tell me
what happened here

34:39.244 --> 34:42.282
or am I gonna use your head
to clean the toilets again?

34:45.875 --> 34:48.583
It was the two Earp girls.

35:11.818 --> 35:14.060
Not two Earp girls.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.439
Three.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.570
So what do we do now, boss?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.623
- Everybody clear on the target?
- Yeah.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.704
Not that it matters.
This is a clean sweep.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.120
- No witnesses, gentlemen.
- You got it.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.600
- You're quiet.
- Yeah, I'm just thinking.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.320
There's a lot going on right now
that just doesn't add up.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.698
Like, if Cryderman is dirty,

36:00.867 --> 36:03.405
that means someone
is feeding him some BBD intel.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.529
Someone we know
or someone you work for?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.907
I don't know.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.081
Black Badge isn't just a...

36:13.254 --> 36:16.838
- a job for me.
- Yeah, no kidding.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.054
I get it.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.012
Feeling like you're
about to lose something.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.011
It's OK if you don't like her,
you know.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.601
I'm happy she's back,
I really am.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.606
It's just...

36:34.776 --> 36:38.360
I never really knew her,
you know? Still don't.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.090
We'll get to the bottom of it, alright?

36:40.156 --> 36:43.399
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.
- All of us.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.035
You're good at what you do.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.292
Doesn't matter how many Willas
come back. Doesn't.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.669
We're still gonna need you.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.375
Earp.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.583
- You called me 'Earp'.
- Don't let it get to your head.

37:00.677 --> 37:03.169
And there's only three of you, right?

37:06.433 --> 37:08.516
Smoke bomb! Clear! Clear!

37:10.770 --> 37:12.932
Go, Waverly! Get down!

37:16.818 --> 37:19.060
I thought you said
they can't come on our land.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.820
Revenants can't.
Human assholes can.

37:21.990 --> 37:24.573
Go for the basement now!
Anything without windows!

37:24.743 --> 37:26.359
Go! Go! Go!

37:26.536 --> 37:29.620
Oh! Oh, my God!

37:30.665 --> 37:32.497
Lucky for us,
they don't know we're in here.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.579
Take 'em by surprise?

37:34.753 --> 37:36.710
Get out of my head!

37:45.847 --> 37:47.509
Grenade!

37:53.730 --> 37:55.938
Waverly, hide!

37:56.107 --> 37:57.814
I wish people
would stop saying that!

38:01.529 --> 38:03.111
Come on!

38:03.281 --> 38:05.443
Let's go, bitches!

38:05.617 --> 38:07.108
Come on!

38:09.370 --> 38:11.236
Dolls gave us these
for protection.

38:11.414 --> 38:14.122
It's a bit tricky,
but you think you can do this?

38:14.292 --> 38:16.284
Why do I even ask?

38:16.461 --> 38:19.625
You wanna get all up
in my kitchen?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.755
Eat shit, shit-eaters!

38:24.552 --> 38:26.293
Ugh!

38:38.858 --> 38:41.817
The place is lit.
Fall back! Fall back!

38:48.201 --> 38:49.692
Waverly? Dolls?

38:49.869 --> 38:51.405
We're OK. We're OK.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.491
- Good to go?
- Wait.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.078
For what? They tried to kill us
in our own home again!

38:56.251 --> 38:59.744
Uh, guys,
I think I got a little bit shot.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.129
Waverly!

39:02.298 --> 39:05.166
- They're getting away!
- It's OK. You're OK.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.130
- WYNONNA!
- Just a second!

39:07.303 --> 39:10.137
- OK, it's just a graze.
- Just?

39:11.349 --> 39:14.308
- Shit! Willa!
- Go, we can't lose her again.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.437
Take care of her.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.785
Ohh!

39:33.955 --> 39:37.119
It's OK. Hey, hey, hey. You got it.
You're gonna be alright.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.105
Get away from her!

40:07.947 --> 40:10.030
Bye-bye, Bobo.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.362
What...

40:14.412 --> 40:17.075
I finally had him!

40:17.248 --> 40:20.366
- Did he hurt you?
- Hurt me?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.284
Wynonna, he saved me.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.297
Do you think it'll scar?

40:33.014 --> 40:34.755
Dudes dig scars.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.640
Do chicks?

40:39.062 --> 40:40.519
Perimeter's clear.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.099
You know, most of those guys

40:42.273 --> 40:44.139
had top-shelf gear,
military tattoos.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.104
- Mercenaries?
- Wasn't a siege.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.859
It was an assassination attempt.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.988
Other than revenants,
who wants to kill us that badly?

40:51.157 --> 40:52.648
Is it about Willa?

40:52.825 --> 40:55.283
Do they know she's back
or that there might be two heirs?

40:55.453 --> 40:57.365
This isn't really about Willa
or you.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.621
I pulled this off of
one of the bodies.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.124
The target was me.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.625
Wynonna?

41:07.215 --> 41:08.501
I need you to tell me

41:08.675 --> 41:10.667
everything you know
about Bobo Del Rey.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.642
No kidding.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.603
I thought I was doing
what you asked.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.392
Dolls and Black Badge, done.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.185
The Earp heir, done.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.041
Please. Please don't kill me.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.668
I'll do whatever you want.

41:46.838 --> 41:50.127
- Anything!
- Oh, I know.

41:50.299 --> 41:52.666
You see, what I want...

41:53.678 --> 41:55.795
is for you to throw me a party.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.047
Heh.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.601
What in tarnation!

42:20.955 --> 42:23.447
Whatever the hell you are,
Juan Carlo,

42:23.624 --> 42:26.583
a decent mechanic you are not.
