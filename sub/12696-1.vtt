WEBVTT

00:10.533 --> 00:11.833
- Hey, we're back.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.400
Since Chloe's been having so
many superhero growth spurts,

00:14.500 --> 00:18.067
we got her some new
clothes at the mall.

00:18.167 --> 00:21.067
- Check out what
I got her.

00:24.033 --> 00:28.633
Oh, we are so putting her
in that right now.

00:28.733 --> 00:32.733
- Uh, guys, I'm not sure
that's gonna fit anymore.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.367
- She grew again.

00:38.467 --> 00:40.800
- I want pizza.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.767
- And she learned
how to talk?

00:42.867 --> 00:44.900
How long were
we at the mall?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.367
- Now that she's bigger,

00:46.467 --> 00:48.267
I bet that her bubble
power's stronger.

00:48.367 --> 00:51.133
- Let's get this
bubble party started!

00:53.967 --> 00:55.633
- Hey, no bubbles.

00:55.733 --> 00:57.733
Billy broke her.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.333
- Chloe's not broken.

00:59.433 --> 01:02.700
I think she just
outgrew her baby power.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.133
Ooh, I wonder what
her permanent power will be?

01:05.233 --> 01:06.400
- Let's go call
the doc in Metroburg

01:06.500 --> 01:08.867
and see if he can come
give Chloe a power scan,

01:08.967 --> 01:10.567
and take a look
at this rash.

01:10.667 --> 01:14.067
- Dad, that's dried barbecue
sauce from the food court.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.100
- Hm, get the internet
on your phone

01:16.200 --> 01:18.533
and suddenly everybody's
a doctor.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.700
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

01:20.800 --> 01:22.500
Cherry approaching.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.667
- Don't worry--
I'll get the door!

01:24.767 --> 01:26.400
- Your cape ceremony
was like a week ago.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.100
Why are you still
wearing that thing?

01:29.700 --> 01:31.433
You mean the one I earned for
saving your life from King Crab?

01:31.533 --> 01:33.200
Is that the cape
you're talking about?

01:33.300 --> 01:35.167
This one

01:35.267 --> 01:37.933
- Like anyone cares
that you saved my life.

01:38.067 --> 01:42.967
Is that the cape
you got for saving Max's life?

01:43.067 --> 01:45.867
- Don't make me freeze
your friend.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.300
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

01:48.400 --> 01:51.400
Incoming transmission
from Super President Kickbutt.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.800
Hank, did you cut yourself?

01:53.900 --> 01:57.267
Oh, no, that's just
more sauce.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.267
- Hello, Thundermans...

01:59.367 --> 02:04.100
and the local girl you just had
to tell your secret to.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.267
- Lookin' good, Mrs. Butt!

02:07.367 --> 02:09.200
- I'm calling for Phoebe.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.200
The Hero League has decided
to give you a trial run

02:12.300 --> 02:15.900
to protect your
very own city--Hiddenville.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.467
- BARB: Oh!
- HANK: Ho! Ho! Ho!

02:17.567 --> 02:19.667
Our baby's protecting
Hiddenville!

02:19.767 --> 02:21.533
- Ah, this is so awesome.

02:21.633 --> 02:23.867
- Hiddenville is the perfect
place for you to learn the art

02:23.967 --> 02:28.667
of managing a normal life while
fighting crime from the shadows.

02:28.767 --> 02:32.200
- What makes you think I'm ready
for something like this?

02:32.300 --> 02:34.933
You saved Max's life.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.067
- *

02:41.167 --> 02:42.267
* What you see

02:42.367 --> 02:43.933
* Is not what you get

02:44.067 --> 02:47.067
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:47.167 --> 02:48.867
* We fit right in

02:48.967 --> 02:50.333
* Bet you never guessed

02:50.433 --> 02:51.833
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:51.933 --> 02:53.433
* Just like all the rest

02:53.533 --> 02:55.200
* A picture
perfect family *

02:55.300 --> 02:57.300
* Is what we try to be

02:57.400 --> 02:58.467
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:58.567 --> 03:00.367
* The crazy things we do

03:00.467 --> 03:02.067
* This isn't
make believe *

03:02.167 --> 03:03.833
* It's our reality

03:03.933 --> 03:05.233
* Just your average family

03:05.333 --> 03:08.333
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

03:08.433 --> 03:11.967
* Livin' a double life

03:16.400 --> 03:19.200
- Thank you for coming
so quickly, Dr. Ouch.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.467
What's your first
name

03:23.567 --> 03:25.900
- It's pronounced Bah-boo.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.067
And it looks like Chloe's had
her final growth spurt.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.567
- BARB: Oh.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.667
- Can you tell us what her
permanent superpower will be

03:31.767 --> 03:35.533
and make this overpriced
house call worthwhile?

03:35.633 --> 03:38.333
- I should be able to narrow
it down with a power scan.

03:39.967 --> 03:42.800
- Adios.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.933
- Run, Billy.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.133
- Aw, Chloe,
it's gonna be okay.

03:51.233 --> 03:55.500
Believe me--I've seen
a lot of doctors.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.733
What if I hold your hand?
- Okay.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.800
Not so bad.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.800
- You're my hero.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.733
- Looks like Chloe's superpower
will be one of three things--

04:14.833 --> 04:18.533
super-strength,
teleportation or...

04:18.633 --> 04:21.633
vomit comets?
- BARB & HANK: Ew.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.900
- Ooops, sorry.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.233
Make that sonic screaming.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.433
You'll know
within the week.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.333
- I wonder which
power she'll get?

04:29.433 --> 04:32.067
- Well, sweetie,
it's anyone's guess.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.933
I just landed an audition for
the Hiddenville Junior Ballet.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.400
Everything's comin' up Phoebe!

04:44.500 --> 04:47.200
- Activate vomit comet.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.833
- That's fantastic,
honey, you know?

04:48.933 --> 04:50.200
But you're gonna have
a lot on your plate

04:50.300 --> 04:52.233
with ballet and being
Hiddenville's protector.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.733
- Not a problem--

04:53.833 --> 04:55.633
thanks to this sweet
surveillance tablet

04:55.733 --> 04:57.633
from the Hero League--
check it out.

04:57.733 --> 04:59.733
It scans the town for
any suspicious activity.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.633
So, I'll know immediately
if there's trouble

05:01.733 --> 05:03.933
and I need to split
even if I'm...

05:04.067 --> 05:07.100
mid-split!

05:07.200 --> 05:11.200
- We get it.
You're flexible.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.767
- Before I leave,
I should warn you--

05:12.867 --> 05:14.667
flamingo flu
is running rampant

05:14.767 --> 05:16.500
in the superhero
community this year.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.333
- Oh, yes, flamingo flu.

05:18.433 --> 05:22.367
The virus slowly
turns you into a flamingo.

05:22.467 --> 05:25.667
- Great. Another
internet doctor.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.833
- Yeah, my cousin Lydia
had flamingo flu.

05:27.933 --> 05:30.900
She used to be a teacher
and now she works at the zoo.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.967
Three shows a day.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.133
- The only way to fight a super
bug is with a super bug.

05:36.233 --> 05:37.800
Chloe's too young to catch it,

05:37.900 --> 05:40.067
but you'll all have
to take these.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.067
- MAX:
Yes! Arachnobiotics!

05:42.133 --> 05:43.300
You go, Booboo.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.133
- It's Bah-boo!

05:46.233 --> 05:49.900
Just put the little guy on your
arm and it'll do the rest.

05:50.067 --> 05:51.367
I've got one left.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.433
- That one's Billy's.

05:55.900 --> 05:56.933
Silly Billy.

05:57.067 --> 06:00.500
- Trust me, Billy,
these spiders don't hurt.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.433
- Ow!

06:06.533 --> 06:10.067
- Oops, I was stepping
on his foot.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.367
- Max, are you okay...

06:11.467 --> 06:14.167
or am I gonna have to
save your life again?

06:14.267 --> 06:15.667
- I heard about that.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.567
Can you sign my lab coat?

06:17.667 --> 06:19.267
- Hey, I don't need this.

06:19.367 --> 06:20.533
I'm gonna be in
my lair plotting evil

06:20.633 --> 06:22.267
and ironing my jeans...

06:22.367 --> 06:24.467
evilly!

06:28.667 --> 06:30.633
- Too bad you guys weren't
looking when I took that,

06:30.733 --> 06:33.133
'cause I took it
like a champ!

06:36.267 --> 06:38.967
- Behold!
My latest invention--

06:39.067 --> 06:42.367
the world's first magnet
that attracts gold.

06:42.467 --> 06:44.200
Soon everyone'll be
talking about this

06:44.300 --> 06:47.067
and not about Phoebe
saving my life.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.133
- No one's talking about
Phoebe saving your life.

06:51.233 --> 06:53.967
Was that convincing?

06:55.633 --> 07:00.167
- Huh, that's the secure line
I set up for Dark Mayhem.

07:00.267 --> 07:03.300
- BOTH:
He's finally calling!

07:03.400 --> 07:04.800
- I can't find
the secure line button!

07:04.900 --> 07:06.300
- Whoa!

07:06.400 --> 07:08.933
- Stupid Colosso.

07:09.067 --> 07:11.067
Why'd you have to buy me
this gold pinky ring?

07:11.100 --> 07:14.800
- The circle symbolizes
the eternity of our friendship.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.333
Dark Mayhem, uh, sir.

07:22.433 --> 07:25.167
It is an honor to meet you.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.333
Because I'm not honored to
meet you, Thunder Turd.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.600
You gave away the top secret
location of the Villain League.

07:33.700 --> 07:37.300
- Yes, that was a tiny bump
in the evil road,

07:37.400 --> 07:39.767
but, hey, I am on
my A-game now.

07:39.867 --> 07:43.500
- Are you stuck
to a magnet?

07:43.600 --> 07:45.500
- Technically, it's
a gold-attracting magnet.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.233
It's one of a kind.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.067
- Technically,
you're an idiot!

07:49.100 --> 07:52.100
But, occasionally, you show
true evil potential,

07:52.200 --> 07:53.833
so, I'm going to give
you a second chance

07:53.933 --> 07:56.467
to prove you're
Villain League material.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.067
I mean, of course, you will,
'cause Maxy T

08:01.167 --> 08:05.333
is one bad mamma jamma.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.867
- I want you to keep a record
of all your evil doings.

08:08.967 --> 08:12.200
!

08:12.300 --> 08:16.433
- Uh, uh, uh, journal.
Memoir. Oh, chronicle.

08:16.533 --> 08:18.567
- I'll allow it.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.433
Now go spread mayhem

08:20.533 --> 08:22.567
and take off
that pinky ring.

08:22.667 --> 08:24.300
It's weird.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.867
- Come on, Hiddenville,
give me something. Anything.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.633
- Hey, there's
my little caped crusader.

08:33.733 --> 08:36.200
Keeping the couch
crime free, I see.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.967
- The town is crime free.
That's the problem.

08:39.067 --> 08:42.333
All I did today was return
somebody's lost wallet.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.067
- Thanks, by the way.
- Mm-hm.

08:44.167 --> 08:47.467
- Look, the Hero League always
starts you out at an easy town.

08:47.567 --> 08:50.367
My first job was
defending Lamesville.

08:50.467 --> 08:52.633
- I thought you knew that.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.333
Isn't that why you always
say I'm from Lamesville?

08:56.433 --> 08:59.600
Duh, totally.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.833
Dad, I fought King Crab.

09:01.933 --> 09:03.867
Now I'm just fighting
to stay awake.

09:03.967 --> 09:05.567
- It's baby steps, honey.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.367
Remember, this is all about
learning to balance

09:07.467 --> 09:11.733
between being a superhero,
ballet, your love of ponies.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.133
- Ponies are Nora.

09:13.233 --> 09:17.167
- Sorry. There's a lot of
girls in this house now.

09:17.267 --> 09:18.800
- Fine. Balance.

09:18.900 --> 09:22.100
Guess I'll just practice
for my ballet audition until I--

09:24.067 --> 09:27.233
- Oh, silent alarm tripped
at the high school.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.667
- Finally, my town needs me!

09:29.767 --> 09:33.100
Huh, I really do have
to split mid-split.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.867
- Give it a rest, bendy.

09:36.967 --> 09:44.333
- *

09:45.967 --> 09:48.700
- Colosso, ransoming these
trophies back to the school

09:48.800 --> 09:51.067
is gonna look great in
my evil diary--

09:51.133 --> 09:52.967
chronicle.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.700
- Stop yapping
and keep your eyes open.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.200
- Unhand those
accomplishments!

10:05.167 --> 10:07.100
- Max, I should have
known this was you.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.267
- Of course. I'm the only one in
this town who cares about evil.

10:10.367 --> 10:12.200
- That's right. You are.

10:12.300 --> 10:15.400
- So, you gonna turn me
in to Mom and Dad?

10:15.500 --> 10:19.600
- Actually, how about
I let you go?

10:19.700 --> 10:21.433
You get to keep committing
your little crimes,

10:21.533 --> 10:23.433
and I get to practice
stopping you.

10:23.533 --> 10:24.967
It's a win-win.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.967
Well, for me, 'cause
I'll always win.

10:27.067 --> 10:29.767
- Okay, I...I accept
your challenge.

10:29.867 --> 10:34.467
But when I win, I'll be the one
flaunting it in your face,

10:34.567 --> 10:36.533
and you'll never catch me.

10:36.633 --> 10:39.233
- Oh!

10:39.333 --> 10:42.200
The door caught me--
not you.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.567
- *

10:46.667 --> 10:48.933
- I was this close to
stealing those jewels.

10:53.067 --> 10:56.533
- I was this close to starting
an elephant stampede.

11:01.733 --> 11:03.700
- I was this close
to not catching you.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.267
Just kidding.
It was easy.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.867
- Oh, I'll throw myself in.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.200
But this isn't over!

11:10.300 --> 11:17.533
- *

11:19.067 --> 11:20.300
- I'm baby-proofing
the windows

11:20.400 --> 11:23.800
in case Chloe's new superpower
is sonic-screaming.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.067
- And, if it's teleporting,

11:25.167 --> 11:27.700
I'm hoping this thing will
take me with her.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.567
Aim for Hawaii, Chloe.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.567
- CHLOE: I'm thinking
Vegas, baby!

11:32.667 --> 11:34.200
- And, if it's super-strength,

11:34.300 --> 11:36.600
I used your credit card
to get a new cell phone.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.467
"Nice try"?

11:39.567 --> 11:41.167
Who gave Dad my number?

11:46.533 --> 11:49.400
- Bless you.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.467
Feeling under the weather?

11:51.567 --> 11:53.333
I'm not under the feather.

11:53.433 --> 11:56.567
Why would you
even say that?

11:56.667 --> 11:58.333
Hey, look, everyone,
it's Phoebe.

11:58.433 --> 12:01.467
Let's ask her things now.

12:03.733 --> 12:08.333
- Yep. Wish me luck.

12:08.433 --> 12:10.133
- Uh-oh, duty calls.

12:10.233 --> 12:12.633
Guess I have to say the day
before my audition.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.833
Gotta go.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.500
- I gotta go, too.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.200
But not "go"
as in "flamingo."

12:18.300 --> 12:20.267
Get off my back!

12:25.200 --> 12:26.800
- All right, let's get
this over with, Max.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.533
I have an audition to
get to and--

12:28.633 --> 12:33.667
Whoa, defeated by a door.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.167
I'm just gonna stop
trying so hard.

12:36.267 --> 12:38.400
- I'm about to have my head
popped like a zit.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.967
Just get me outta here!

12:40.067 --> 12:44.400
- All right, fine.
I'll save your life--again.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.733
- I'm not the one who's gonna
need saving this time.

12:48.833 --> 12:51.100
- And what exactly do
I need saving from?

12:51.200 --> 12:54.600
- Oh, just the world's only
gold-attracting magnet.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.233
- Whoa!

12:58.767 --> 13:00.700
- I'm about to take
down your town.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.500
I told you this
wasn't over.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.067
- Yes! Victory is mine!

13:09.133 --> 13:10.800
* You're the worst
I'm the best *

13:10.900 --> 13:12.967
* Maxy T's the evilest
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! *

13:13.067 --> 13:15.733
- Stop it!
Fine, you win this round.

13:15.833 --> 13:18.367
Now can you please let me go so
I can get to my ballet audition.

13:18.467 --> 13:22.067
- You're not going anywhere,
Thunder Turd.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.633
It feels so good
to say that to someone else.

13:24.733 --> 13:26.067
See these pipes?

13:26.167 --> 13:27.467
They bring water to the city

13:27.567 --> 13:31.300
and I'm gonna melt them
with this nitric acid

13:31.400 --> 13:33.567
and turn Hiddenville
into a desert.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.633
* Maxy T's on fire!

13:36.733 --> 13:38.667
- Max, wait.
It's not too late to stop.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.167
- I'm afraid it is.

13:40.267 --> 13:42.200
- No, I mean it's
not too late

13:42.300 --> 13:44.400
to stop calling
yourself "Maxy T."

13:44.500 --> 13:46.567
- Hey, pipe down!

13:46.667 --> 13:49.133
Get it? Pipe.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.833
That's goin' in
Maxy T's chronicle.

13:51.933 --> 13:54.267
That's right.
The name stays!

14:01.233 --> 14:04.067
- Billy, come inside.
Mom's looking for you.

14:04.167 --> 14:05.967
- Tell her I'm taking a bath.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.600
Just don't mention
it's a bird bath.

14:11.967 --> 14:13.767
But you took the super bug.

14:13.867 --> 14:14.933
- No, I didn't.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.467
It's the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

14:16.567 --> 14:19.067
Well, besides watching Dad
eat chicken wings.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.800
Bones go in, Nora,
but they don't come out.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.500
- Give me the super bug.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.600
- No, I hid it far away
in a place you'll never find.

14:31.233 --> 14:34.533
- Yes.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.800
Please don't tell Chloe
I was too scared to do it.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.767
She said I'm her hero.

14:38.867 --> 14:40.100
I don't wanna lose that.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.633
- But you're okay
with turning into a bird.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.233
- I know what I'm doing.

14:45.333 --> 14:49.367
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to use the bathroom.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.133
Please don't be an egg.
Please don't be an egg.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.267
- Time to unleash
Operation Dry Mouth.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.500
- Come on, Phoebe,

15:10.600 --> 15:13.333
time to unleash Operation
Defeat the Dancing Dork.

15:13.433 --> 15:16.567
Oh, maybe I can melt
the wiring in the magnet.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.067
- Okay, the only thing
that could go wrong

15:20.167 --> 15:21.700
is if the polarity
reverses itself--Whoa!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.167
- You have to stop!
- Too late!

15:28.267 --> 15:29.933
The nitric acid is already

15:30.067 --> 15:32.067
making its way
through the pipes.

15:34.933 --> 15:37.333
- Yeah, I'm not so
sure about that.

15:37.433 --> 15:40.100
It's not nitric acid,
it's citric acid--

15:40.200 --> 15:42.733
as in orange juice.

15:45.867 --> 15:47.700
Colosso, how could
this happen?

15:47.800 --> 15:51.767
- You try shopping
online with paws!

15:51.867 --> 15:54.900
- Yum! Free orange
juice for everyone!

15:55.067 --> 15:56.067
It's like you're Hiddenville's
other superhero--

15:56.167 --> 15:58.667
Captain Backfire.

15:58.767 --> 16:00.067
- I wanna crush this town,

16:00.133 --> 16:03.067
not provide it with
part of a balanced breakfast.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.667
I gotta stop that juice!

16:04.767 --> 16:07.200
Uh...

16:07.300 --> 16:10.433
Aha! The outflow pipe.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.833
You're gonna back up
the whole system

16:15.933 --> 16:17.433
and all the pipes will burst.

16:17.533 --> 16:20.067
- Oh, you're so
dramatic, Phoebe.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.133
- But you're not wrong.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.900
Good enough for
my evil chronicle.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.067
Let's get outta here
before this place blows.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.800
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.933
This is my city.
I have to protect it.

16:36.067 --> 16:38.167
Oh! Uh...

16:43.767 --> 16:45.900
- I can't leave you.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.667
- No, the door's locked.

16:47.767 --> 16:56.300
- *

16:56.400 --> 16:58.800
- Got it.

16:58.900 --> 17:02.433
Whoa!

17:02.533 --> 17:06.833
- Well, it's not
super-strength yet.

17:06.933 --> 17:09.533
- Oh, Billy, there you are.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.600
Why are you wearing
that blanket?

17:11.700 --> 17:13.733
- Yeah, are you trying
to hide something?

17:13.833 --> 17:15.267
- No!

17:15.367 --> 17:16.800
What are you hiding
under that bow?

17:16.900 --> 17:20.067
Jinx! Now you can't talk.

17:20.133 --> 17:22.667
- Billy, just sit
down and eat.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.433
- I don't sit anymore.

17:24.533 --> 17:26.067
And it's not because
my knee's bent backwards,

17:26.100 --> 17:28.467
if that's what
you're thinking.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.500
- Billy, you're being
a bird brain.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.900
You should tell Mom and Dad
if something's bugging you.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.567
- I'm fine.

17:35.667 --> 17:37.533
Ooh, shrimp!

17:41.200 --> 17:44.067
- Guys, I'm still
down here.

17:44.167 --> 17:46.267
- Oh, Chloe.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.367
Oh, no.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.367
- There's another
leak over there.

18:01.467 --> 18:03.400
- Oh!

18:04.700 --> 18:06.533
Did you see
that perfect technique?

18:06.633 --> 18:08.433
I would have nailed
that ballet audition

18:08.533 --> 18:10.067
if you didn't make me miss it.

18:10.133 --> 18:11.900
- Oh, that's enough!

18:12.067 --> 18:13.567
This isn't my fault.
It's yours.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.433
How do you figure?

18:15.533 --> 18:17.300
You're the one trying
to destroy Hiddenville,

18:17.400 --> 18:19.067
you fresh-squeezed fool!

18:19.167 --> 18:20.800
- Because of
your dumb challenge.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.367
And because you wouldn't stop
blabbing about saving my life.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.367
- Since when do you
care about me teasing you?

18:25.467 --> 18:27.400
- Since everything's
been coming up Phoebe.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.800
I've been in a total evil slump
while you've been

18:29.900 --> 18:31.600
out saving me,
saving the town,

18:31.700 --> 18:33.767
doing that weird thing
you do with your leg.

18:33.867 --> 18:35.367
How do you even do that?

18:35.467 --> 18:38.300
- I'm not as great
as you think, okay?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.333
I should be out solving crimes,
not daring you to do them.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.300
And I certainly shouldn't
be going around

18:42.400 --> 18:44.300
bragging about saving lives--
like I saved yours.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.067
- Sorry.

18:46.133 --> 18:47.500
Last time. I promise.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.067
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Warning!

18:51.167 --> 18:52.933
System failure in ten seconds.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.100
Assume blast protocol.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.067
- There's gotta be a way
to shut down the system

18:57.167 --> 18:58.667
before the building explodes.

18:58.767 --> 19:01.067
Oh, there!
We need to turn that wheel!

19:01.133 --> 19:03.067
Um, Max, I don't have
any hands left.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.533
You'll have to do it.

19:04.633 --> 19:06.733
- You're so lazy--
- Just save the town!

19:06.833 --> 19:13.567
- *

19:13.667 --> 19:16.267
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
System restored.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.967
Max, you did it!

19:20.067 --> 19:22.067
You saved Hiddenville.

19:22.167 --> 19:23.900
- No, I saved you--

19:24.067 --> 19:26.633
which makes us even.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.933
- All right. Fine.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.567
Hey, I wonder where
all the orange juice went?

19:32.667 --> 19:36.700
Everything's
finally coming up Max!

19:46.233 --> 19:48.433
- And now everything's
coming down Max.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.833
- This is so not going
in my chronicle.

19:55.900 --> 19:59.900
- *

20:00.000 --> 20:01.567
- Billy, you just
ate two quarts

20:01.667 --> 20:04.533
of spicy shrimp
without chewing.

20:04.633 --> 20:07.800
I think I know
what's going on here.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.133
- Finally.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.300
- You think you can
out eat your old man!

20:14.400 --> 20:16.000
Challenge accepted!

20:16.100 --> 20:19.700
- Oh, get him, Hank!

20:19.800 --> 20:21.500
- Chloe, I know
what you're thinking,

20:21.600 --> 20:25.033
and, yes,
they're your parents.

20:25.133 --> 20:26.633
- Oh, kids,
you're just in time.

20:26.733 --> 20:29.267
Your dad's taking
Billy to school.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.167
Phoebe, how was your
ballet audition?

20:31.267 --> 20:34.533
- BILLY:

20:34.633 --> 20:37.467
- Billy, tell them what's
happening or I will.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.133
Honk!

20:40.233 --> 20:41.333
- Billy caught
the flamingo flu

20:41.433 --> 20:43.700
'cause he was scared
to take the super bug.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.367
- Don't listen to her, Chloe.
It's a lie.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.567
Your brother's never scared.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.667
- Barb, I ate too much food.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.167
I'm seeing things.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.300
- Billy, if you take
the super bug now,

21:00.400 --> 21:02.100
it will reverse the effects.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.867
I hope.

21:03.967 --> 21:06.067
- Never! To the sky!

21:08.967 --> 21:10.500
- ALL: Whoa!

21:10.600 --> 21:13.433
- Chloe's new power
is teleportation!

21:13.533 --> 21:16.433
- That was my guess.

21:18.467 --> 21:21.133
- I have no idea.

21:21.233 --> 21:23.367
- You can do it, Billy.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.067
- Thanks, Chloe.

21:25.133 --> 21:26.167
Hearing you say that...

21:26.267 --> 21:29.700
changes nothing!

21:29.800 --> 21:32.967
You're everywhere.

21:33.067 --> 21:34.733
- Be brave, Billy.

21:34.833 --> 21:36.900
I'll hold your hand.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.733
- Okay, little sis.

21:42.833 --> 21:46.267
I'll do it for you.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.633
Not so bad.

21:56.167 --> 21:57.900
- Everything's
back to normal.

22:00.733 --> 22:04.533
- I just laid an egg,
didn't I?

22:04.633 --> 22:07.433
- Okay, I'll call
Dr. Ouch.

22:10.867 --> 22:26.733
- *
