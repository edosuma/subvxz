00:02.000 --> 00:05.040
This programme contains adult humour
and some strong language

00:05.040 --> 00:08.960
Granddad wants to hear all the nice
things said about him.
At his own funeral?!

00:08.960 --> 00:14.000
I suggested we have a pretend
funeral and let Granddad hear them.
We better ask the corpse.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.520
Granddad, how would you like
to die on Friday?

00:16.520 --> 00:19.360
Friday is grand!

00:19.360 --> 00:21.240
Friday it is, then!

00:21.240 --> 00:23.160
Hi, Granddad!

00:23.160 --> 00:25.440
Don't talk to him.
He's fuckin' dead!

00:25.440 --> 00:28.520
What's this?
It's Granddad's death certificate.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.320
You don't need a death certificate.
Oh, yes, I do!

00:31.320 --> 00:34.040
He's due 15,000 euro from his union
the day he dies.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.600
He's retired 15 years. I'm flipped
if I'm waiting any longer!

00:38.600 --> 00:41.560
Now let us
take a moment to remember him.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.880
Would anybody like to say
a word in his memory?

00:48.680 --> 00:50.520
OK, then!

00:50.520 --> 00:52.480
GASPS

00:52.480 --> 00:54.720
Has nobody got anything good to say?

00:54.720 --> 00:57.560
He's... he's not dead!

00:57.560 --> 01:01.160
No, he's not! He's alive.
Oh, my God...it's a miracle!

01:01.160 --> 01:03.000
It's a miracle, Father!

01:14.320 --> 01:18.040
'Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!'

01:18.040 --> 01:21.440
# She's Mrs Brown

01:21.440 --> 01:24.840
# That's Mrs Brown

01:24.840 --> 01:27.080
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

01:27.080 --> 01:29.080
APPLAUSE

01:29.080 --> 01:31.880
Winnie, put the kettle on.
I just want to do Granddad's feet!

01:31.880 --> 01:34.800
Hello! I'll be with you
in a couple of minutes.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.080
Granddad,
are you ready for your pedicure?

01:38.080 --> 01:39.760
Ah, good man. Give me a second.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.080
Well, no sign of a flat
yet for Dermot and Maria,

01:43.080 --> 01:44.440
but they are looking.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.280
Agnes, can I ask a stupid question?

01:47.280 --> 01:49.920
Better than anyone else I know!

01:49.920 --> 01:52.720
Why do crabs walk sideways?

01:52.720 --> 01:53.960
So they can do their song!

01:53.960 --> 01:55.000
What?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.560
# Oh, I do like to
be beside the seaside! #

02:01.120 --> 02:02.680
Ah, right!

02:02.680 --> 02:06.280
Well, you can't blame Dermot and
Maria for wanting to move out.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.120
The house is crowded enough
as it is with Trevor home.

02:11.120 --> 02:14.320
But you don't mind sleeping
in the bath do you, Granddad?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.080
Foot!

02:19.960 --> 02:22.800
NAILS SHOOT LIKE BULLETS

02:22.800 --> 02:24.920
I love The Blue Planet.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.640
I'm sure it loves you right back!

02:26.640 --> 02:28.760
No, the programme, on the telly.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.840
Oh, right!

02:29.840 --> 02:32.400
Did you know penguins mate for life?

02:32.400 --> 02:35.480
Of course they do.
They all look the same!

02:37.600 --> 02:40.880
They're hardly going to leave
for a feckin' better looking one!

02:42.480 --> 02:44.560
I suppose.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.320
It would be nice if Trevor
could stay for the big event.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.280
Oh, I never told you.
The big event! Maria's pregnant!

02:52.280 --> 02:54.840
It's so feckin' exciting!

02:54.840 --> 02:56.160
How's Sharon, Winnie?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.200
Don't ask...

02:58.200 --> 02:59.280
Why? What's up?

02:59.280 --> 03:02.680
She has no boyfriend. What happened?
They wanted different things.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.560
Sharon wanted the big white wedding
dress and the honeymoon
in the Carrabini.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.160
And what did he want?
He wanted to break up.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.760
Well, that is feckin' different.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.680
Oh, I better go. Get her up!

03:16.680 --> 03:18.760
I'll call in later.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.400
Oh, me life will be empty till then!

03:21.400 --> 03:23.560
Morning, Mammy!

03:23.560 --> 03:25.840
Hiya, Cathy. How's your Dick?

03:25.840 --> 03:27.520
It's Mick!

03:29.520 --> 03:34.040
And how are things there? Grand
thanks, Winnie. How's Sharon?

03:34.040 --> 03:37.000
Not great. Jeez, better go,
she'll be late!

03:37.000 --> 03:39.600
I'll call over her later
and see if she's OK!

03:39.600 --> 03:40.960
Who's the letter from?

03:40.960 --> 03:44.480
The insurance company...
about Granddad's insurance!

03:44.480 --> 03:48.400
They say they want to investigate
his death. Why would that be?

03:48.400 --> 03:52.640
Let me think...
Maybe because he's not dead!

03:52.640 --> 03:54.160
Well, I blame Granddad.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.200
I told him,
"Stop collecting your pension."

03:57.200 --> 04:00.160
But would he listen? No!

04:00.160 --> 04:04.760
This is serious, Mammy.
They're alleging fraud.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.520
You could go to prison!

04:06.520 --> 04:08.800
PSYCHO VIOLIN SCREECH

04:13.400 --> 04:15.320
Piss off!

04:27.640 --> 04:29.480
I better go.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.360
Don't touch me. Dead man walking!

04:38.040 --> 04:41.120
WASP BUZZES

04:41.120 --> 04:44.840
Granddad, now, remember,
if anyone calls, you're dead!

04:44.840 --> 04:46.480
OK!

04:46.480 --> 04:49.760
WASP BUZZES

04:54.040 --> 04:55.840
Winnie? Yes, Agnes?

04:55.840 --> 04:56.920
Give us me flapper.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.440
BUZZING STOPS

05:10.120 --> 05:11.640
I'm dead!

05:11.640 --> 05:12.760
Don't feckin' move!

05:12.760 --> 05:15.320
Aarrgh!

05:15.320 --> 05:17.040
Fastest flapper in the west!

05:17.040 --> 05:19.000
Good shot, Agnes!
Ah, thanks, Winnie.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.400
Ah, Jesus,
you should clean this thing, Agnes.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.480
I tried, Winnie.
You can't get it off!

05:23.480 --> 05:25.640
I'm sure I have stuff
that would clean this.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.080
One of the products
they sent me to test!

05:28.080 --> 05:29.160
I'll do it right now!

05:29.160 --> 05:31.280
Thanks very much, Winnie!
DOORBELL RINGS

05:31.280 --> 05:34.640
Cathy, Cathy!
Get that door will you please!

05:34.640 --> 05:36.400
Ah, Mammy, I'm doing me make up!

05:36.400 --> 05:39.320
It might be the insurance man
and I have to prepare Granddad.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.040
Come on, Granddad!

05:41.040 --> 05:43.320
Get down!

05:43.320 --> 05:46.840
Oh, for God's sake, Mammy!

05:46.840 --> 05:48.840
He's supposed to be feckin' dead!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.120
Oh, it's YOU.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.480
Jesus, Cathy, what happened to you?

06:04.480 --> 06:07.040
Shut up, Buster Brady.
I'm getting ready for a date.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.080
With who? The Lone Ranger?
Oh, get stuffed!

06:10.080 --> 06:12.040
Hello, Mrs Brown.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.280
Hello, Granddad!

06:15.280 --> 06:17.000
I'm dead!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.880
Is Dermo here?

06:18.880 --> 06:22.120
No. Did you not get your insurance
money yet, Mrs Brown?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.240
Not yet.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.040
Oh, lovely. Two sugars please.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.320
Don't be feckin' cheeky!
And what are you doing here anyway?

06:29.320 --> 06:31.840
We haven't seen you
since the Christmas party!

06:31.840 --> 06:33.840
I just popped around to say hello.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.880
Well, you've said it. Now shag off.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.160
I mean it, Buster Brady.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.520
Every time your name comes up,
Maria gets upset

06:41.520 --> 06:43.360
and I don't want her upset. Not now.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.480
If she walks in
and sees you sitting there,

06:45.480 --> 06:47.320
she'll go through the feckin' roof.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.280
Oh, shite.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.320
How are you, Maria?

06:55.320 --> 06:56.800
Don't feckin' wave!

06:57.920 --> 07:00.120
Are you pregnant, Maria?

07:01.440 --> 07:03.880
No, Buster, it's a cyst!

07:03.880 --> 07:04.960
A cyst?

07:04.960 --> 07:08.640
Yes, a cyst.
A big lump of useless fatty tissue.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.280
Ah yeah, my Ma had one of them.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.200
Yes, she feckin' did!

07:19.920 --> 07:21.480
Will you have a cuppa tea, love?

07:21.480 --> 07:23.840
Oh, I'd love one...
and a biscuit or something.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.600
And a biscuit. Thanks, Mrs Brown.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.440
Maria, I wish you'd stop
calling me Mrs Brown. It's Agnes!

07:30.320 --> 07:32.480
I'll have a biscuit, Agnes.

07:36.200 --> 07:40.080
It's Mrs Brown to you!
And ask properly.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.600
Sorry. May I have a biscuit please,
Mrs Brown.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.800
That's better. Thanks. No!

07:47.840 --> 07:51.000
Are you not talking to me, Maria?

07:51.000 --> 07:55.320
Are you upset about the little
incident at the Christmas party?
LITTLE incident?

07:55.320 --> 07:57.200
You stole my mother's handbag.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.480
I made a mistake, that's all.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.800
What, you robbed it by accident?
Well, no, I didn't know it was hers.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.600
All right, listen, I'm off.
Will you tell Dermo I called?

08:10.600 --> 08:11.760
No. No.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.480
Well, I'll just call round
and see him tomorrow so, see yis.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.000
Maybe I was a little hard on him.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.720
Do you think does he still steal?

08:20.720 --> 08:24.120
Are you kidding me?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

08:25.120 --> 08:27.720
Well, he would
if there was a bear chasing him.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.720
Thanks, Mrs Brown. You're welcome.
DOORBELL RINGS

08:37.000 --> 08:38.920
Maria, get that door!

08:38.920 --> 08:42.640
Granddad! Oh, Jesus Christ!
OK. Plan B!

08:42.640 --> 08:43.920
Code red! Code red!

08:44.960 --> 08:46.920
Hold on, Maria!

08:55.560 --> 08:57.280
Go!

09:01.200 --> 09:03.480
Hi, Mum!

09:03.480 --> 09:05.080
Come in!

09:07.200 --> 09:08.880
So what are you doing here?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.960
I just picked up
the most beautiful mater...

09:14.400 --> 09:15.840
..nity dress!

09:15.840 --> 09:19.360
I just couldn't resist it.
I wanted you to try it on.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.320
Ah, thanks, Mum...
I'll try it on now.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.600
Mrs Brown, it's my mother!

09:24.600 --> 09:27.440
Hello, Hillary, how are you?

09:27.440 --> 09:30.240
Sore shoulder from the tennis.
And you?

09:30.240 --> 09:31.960
Oh, itchy crotch from the golf!

09:49.200 --> 09:53.400
Oh, well a new baby's
so exciting, isn't it, Agnes?

09:53.400 --> 09:56.640
Well, yes, it is but the excitement
wears off after six.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.600
I don't even think I went
into hospital for the last one.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.320
I just dropped it. Badump!

10:01.320 --> 10:05.320
"Oh, look there's a baby.
Put it in the pram!"

10:06.760 --> 10:10.520
Great fashion eye, Mrs Nicholson.
It looks well on her!

10:11.760 --> 10:14.000
It's lovely, Mum, thank you.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.720
Cuppa tea, Maria?

10:15.720 --> 10:17.160
Sure. Tea, Mum?

10:17.160 --> 10:20.040
No, thanks, I'm off.
I'm playing golf in an hour.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.640
Oh, watch out for the...

10:24.200 --> 10:28.120
OK, I'll see you tomorrow,
I'll call over after work!

10:28.120 --> 10:31.280
You were right, Agnes,
even my stuff didn't clean it!

10:31.280 --> 10:32.920
Ah, hello, Mrs Nicholson.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.360
Hello, I'm just going.
Oh, here, Mrs Nicholson,

10:35.360 --> 10:38.440
how do YOU clean the dead
flies off YOUR flapper?

10:42.280 --> 10:43.600
What?!

10:43.600 --> 10:48.520
I'll try bleach Agnes.
I'll dip your flapper in bleach!

10:48.520 --> 10:52.000
BLEACH? I must be off...

10:52.000 --> 10:55.360
It's such an exciting time,
childbirth!

10:55.360 --> 10:57.280
Well, I've been excited six times!

10:57.280 --> 11:01.120
I only had Maria,
but it was such a wonderful time.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.760
Jonathan was so generous.
That's nice.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.040
When he found out I was pregnant
he bought me this diamond ring.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.320
That's nice!

11:08.320 --> 11:10.680
And then when I was
five months pregnant

11:10.680 --> 11:13.760
he took me away for the weekend
to Paris!

11:13.760 --> 11:15.800
That's France!

11:15.800 --> 11:17.080
That's nice.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.520
And THEN when Maria was born,
he bought me a Mercedes Benz!

11:20.520 --> 11:21.760
That's nice.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.800
What did your husband buy for you?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.760
He got me elocution lessons!

11:25.760 --> 11:29.320
(LAUGHS) Didn't really work,
did they?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.000
Actually, they did!

11:31.000 --> 11:33.240
I used to say "Fuck off"...

11:33.240 --> 11:35.480
but now I say, "That's nice."

11:41.680 --> 11:46.640
Yes, I understand.
Yes, I'll tell her that.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.080
I'll pass that on, goodbye.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.520
Who was that?

11:52.520 --> 11:55.800
A Mr Rooney. Claims adjuster
from Celtic Life Insurance.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.080
Oh. What did HE want? He wants to
interview you. He's coming today!

11:59.080 --> 12:02.080
I sent them the death certificate.
That's all that matters!

12:02.080 --> 12:04.280
And HE knows he's dead,
don't you Granddad?

12:04.280 --> 12:05.440
What?

12:05.440 --> 12:06.760
You...dead!

12:06.760 --> 12:08.840
Yeah... dead!

12:08.840 --> 12:12.040
Mammy, look, this is really serious.
You're not going to get paid.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.880
Granddad is NOT dead!
That's just a technicality!

12:14.880 --> 12:17.280
It says Cadbury's Chocolate
on the side of buses

12:17.280 --> 12:18.480
and they don't sell it!

12:20.520 --> 12:23.080
I promised the money
to Maria and Dermot

12:23.080 --> 12:25.400
to get them
started in a place of their own.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.720
Well, you'll have to unpromise
them, then. No.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.560
Mammy, never mind the money,
you could go to prison for fraud!

12:31.560 --> 12:33.440
You're being ridiculous now, son!

12:33.440 --> 12:34.760
I hope you're right!

12:37.240 --> 12:38.720
Hi, there!

12:38.720 --> 12:40.400
Hello, Maria. How was work?

12:40.400 --> 12:44.880
Don't talk to me. I've never seen
A&E so busy! Hiya, Trevor.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.760
Any word about going back
on the missions? Nothing yet.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.080
Now we don't need to be
talking about that now.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.240
Let's just thank God you're home.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.520
I'll make you a sandwich, Maria.
No, I'm grand.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.200
I've got some couscous.
Some what what?

12:57.200 --> 12:59.000
Couscous. It's healthy.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.240
Looks shit shit!

13:02.040 --> 13:06.080
Don't worry about anything for
Dermot, I have a pesto pasta salad.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.120
I'm after cooking
some Superquinn sausages!
No. The salad's better for him.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.800
He'll have the sausages!
Oh, no, he won't!

13:16.080 --> 13:18.800
I think I know what my son likes!

13:18.800 --> 13:22.160
Well, I think
I know what's good for my husband!

13:22.160 --> 13:24.160
I think I'll just go
and say a few prayers.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.520
Chicken bastard!

13:29.400 --> 13:32.520
Maria, look, I know you're only new
to being a wife,

13:32.520 --> 13:34.720
but I'm cooking
for my children for years.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.560
I know what Dermot likes.
Let's just leave it at that!

13:37.560 --> 13:40.000
No, Mrs Brown,
let's not leave it at that.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.760
What you fed your children
in the past was dictated

13:42.760 --> 13:45.800
by budget and availability
but times have changed.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.040
There's healthier options out
there now than everything fried.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.200
Dermot will have the salad!

13:52.200 --> 13:54.360
Dermot will eat the sausages.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.200
Hello, everybody!!

13:59.200 --> 14:02.360
Hello, son. Come on,
sit down in Mammy's chair.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.800
Thanks, Mammy.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.800
Hiya darling,
I got you a lovely salad.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.000
Yeah! And once you've realised
you're not a white rabbit,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.360
you can have some lovely
Superquinn sausages!

14:38.040 --> 14:39.720
Right then, let's begin.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.000
You have six offspring?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.080
Yes. Five boys and a child.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.280
And this is?

14:53.160 --> 14:57.400
That's Gretchen, our exchange
student from Switzerland.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.680
I see. And Granddad is dead?

14:59.680 --> 15:02.720
(SOBS) Why do you keep
bringing it up?!

15:02.720 --> 15:04.320
When did Granddad die?

15:04.320 --> 15:08.440
If he'd lived till next Friday, he'd
be dead ten months. And he died of?

15:08.440 --> 15:10.920
A Tuesday. Right.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.720
What is this?

15:12.720 --> 15:16.080
It's a toe nail.
It's all we have left of him.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.880
Well, one of the problems
we are having Mrs Brown is

15:18.880 --> 15:21.400
we can find no record
of Granddad dying.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.240
Well, I sent in the death
certificate. Oh, this!

15:24.240 --> 15:26.800
Yes, well, although this IS
the death certificate,

15:26.800 --> 15:28.920
it was never officially registered

15:28.920 --> 15:31.680
at the office of Births,
Marriages And Deaths.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.280
Well, that's not my fault.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.440
And actually,
I put it to you, Mrs Brown,

15:37.440 --> 15:42.120
that this strange little girl
is in fact Granddad!

15:42.120 --> 15:46.120
No, no that's Gretchen our exchange
student from Switzerland!

15:46.120 --> 15:47.520
Hello, Mrs Brown!

15:47.520 --> 15:48.840
How are you, Granddad?!

15:53.240 --> 15:57.000
You feckin' ejit!
Well, that's that! Fair enough.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.800
Thanks very much for dropping in.
No, hold on Mrs. Brown,

15:59.800 --> 16:01.040
That is NOT that.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.160
My company takes
a very dim view of your actions.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.640
A false insurance claim
is a criminal offence.

16:06.640 --> 16:09.160
I have to caution you,
you may be charged.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.560
How much?

16:10.560 --> 16:12.960
Charged in a court of law,
Mrs Brown.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.440
You could go to prison!

16:16.880 --> 16:20.600
Hold on there, pal. You can't talk
to Mrs Brown like that!

16:20.600 --> 16:23.640
If you knew about this, you
could be charged as an accessory.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.040
You could also go to prison.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.840
Prison?

16:27.840 --> 16:30.880
It was her.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.400
See yas!

16:35.880 --> 16:37.720
(SOBS) Prison?

16:37.720 --> 16:39.560
EASTENDERS DRUM ROLL

16:46.080 --> 16:49.960
You could become some big, butch
woman's bitch!

16:52.720 --> 16:54.040
I beg your pardon, Sharon?

16:54.040 --> 16:57.280
In prison!
You'll have to get a tattoo!

16:57.280 --> 16:58.560
Sharon!

16:58.560 --> 17:00.440
Shut up, Sharon!

17:00.440 --> 17:02.760
You are not going to any prison,
Agnes Brown.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.200
Thanks you, Winnie.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.240
But I did check and the number 40
bus stops right outside,

17:07.240 --> 17:10.280
so I'll have no problem visiting.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.840
Well, thanks for the feckin' pep
talk! Will you stop, Winnie?!

17:13.840 --> 17:16.440
Mammy, maybe you should get
a solicitor.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.840
I tried. I called Mr McGocchi
of Hardy, Kunch and McGocchi.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.480
Tom? Tom McGocchi?

17:21.480 --> 17:23.760
Yes.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.080
What did he say?

17:25.080 --> 17:26.760
He's in prison.

17:28.640 --> 17:31.000
I'm off to the toilet, who's coming?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.680
I'll go with you, Winnie.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.840
Are you comin' Sharon? No.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.400
Maybe you should.
With your complaint.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.120
What complaint?

17:39.120 --> 17:40.600
She's anorexic.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.200
Anaemic!

17:46.200 --> 17:48.880
Oh, that's better.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.920
Oh, Sharon,
I'm sorry about the break-up.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.680
It's all right.
Plenty more fish in the sea!

17:55.760 --> 17:57.440
Hiya.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.360
Speaking about prison,
he's only out after 15 years.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.160
What did he do?
He murdered his wife.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.000
He's single!

18:08.520 --> 18:10.960
Well, God help the feckin'
fish in the sea!

18:13.120 --> 18:15.840
Hello, son! Hello, Maria love.
How are you?

18:15.840 --> 18:20.120
I'm fine. I heard about the letter.
How are you? I'm OK.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.280
Sharon. How are you, Dermot?

18:22.280 --> 18:24.720
Could we have a quiet word
with me mammy?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.480
Sure.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.600
QUIET!

18:31.680 --> 18:33.520
There you go, Dermot.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.680
Sharon, family business. Feck off!

18:43.320 --> 18:46.720
Mammy, we heard about
the insurance letter.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.360
PSYCHO VIOLIN SCREECH

18:52.360 --> 18:54.200
I said PISS OFF!

19:04.080 --> 19:07.680
That sound goes
through me feckin' head!

19:09.120 --> 19:11.240
We heard about
the letter, Mrs Brown.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.480
I wanted to help you's
get a place of our own.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.400
Don't worry about that, Mrs Brown.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.240
We will get a place and actually,

19:17.240 --> 19:19.520
I think we'd prefer to get it
ourselves.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.000
Wouldn't we, Dermot?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.240
Well, yeah, but if the money
was there.... Dermot!

19:25.800 --> 19:29.280
Yeah, we would. So don't you be
worrying about us, Mammy.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.320
Let's just get this fraud
thing sorted.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.000
Anyway, with you going to prison
there'll be a lot more room!

19:39.520 --> 19:41.560
It'll probably just blow over.

19:41.560 --> 19:45.040
I'm not sure, son.
Celtic Insurance are a big company,

19:45.040 --> 19:47.760
and that man looked VERY serious!

19:47.760 --> 19:49.840
Celtic Insurance? Yes.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.680
Hmm. They are big.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.160
Jaysus, all this just
cos Granddad is still alive!

20:15.480 --> 20:16.880
Granddad!

20:19.360 --> 20:21.760
I have some chocolate
eclairs for you!

20:21.760 --> 20:24.680
No.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.560
Come on, lovely chocolate eclairs.
You know you love them!

20:27.560 --> 20:30.840
Come on, follow me
into chocolate eclair land!

20:30.840 --> 20:33.000
Ooh, I'm going to
chocolate eclair land!

20:35.960 --> 20:40.320
Granddad, look I mean it,
real chocolate eclairs, look!

20:40.320 --> 20:43.040
No.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.040
Who is that? I'm chocolate eclair.

20:46.040 --> 20:49.480
I want somebody to eat me!
Come on Granddad, eat me!

20:49.480 --> 20:53.760
Granddad, look, I mean it,
real chocolate eclairs!

20:53.760 --> 20:56.800
Look, smell, smell, smell!
Mmm, Lovely!

20:56.800 --> 21:00.120
PHONE RINGS

21:13.280 --> 21:16.320
SPEAKS IN A STRAINED VOICE: Hello?

21:16.320 --> 21:18.080
Hold on, Mick.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.920
Cathy!

21:23.760 --> 21:25.080
SHE WHEEZES

21:25.080 --> 21:27.880
Cathy!
Mick the dick is on the phone!

21:31.280 --> 21:33.640
Hi Mick. Oh, great.

21:36.320 --> 21:40.280
Yes, Mick. Where are you?

21:40.280 --> 21:42.400
Ah, that's just around the corner!

21:42.400 --> 21:46.120
Cathy! Have you got a light?

21:46.120 --> 21:48.000
In me handbag, Mammy.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.480
No, don't get a coffee.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.840
I'll meet you.
You can come here for a cup of tea.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.000
Ah, for feck's sake!

22:09.000 --> 22:11.600
Listen, I'm just slipping
out to meet Mick.

22:11.600 --> 22:16.160
I'll be back in a few minutes,
all right? I said I'd...

22:16.160 --> 22:20.360
I said... I'd go down the shops
with Winnie.
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:20.360 --> 22:22.240
It's open, Winnie!

22:24.400 --> 22:28.320
How are ye, Cathy?
How's it going with Mick the dick?

22:28.320 --> 22:31.440
I wish you'd all mind
your own business!

22:31.440 --> 22:33.880
Jaysus, she's in bad form.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.600
She mustn't be getting it.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.880
Maybe he hasn't shown
her his truncheon!

22:42.240 --> 22:45.840
Here, are we going to the shops?
Let me finish me tea...

22:45.840 --> 22:47.560
Here. Look.

22:47.560 --> 22:53.000
Jaysus, where did you get them?
Cathy's handbag. They fell out!

22:53.000 --> 22:55.280
Why Jesus, Winnie,
how times change.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.920
So many different feckin'
kinds nowadays.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.840
I remember when there was only
Wrigley's or Juicy Fruit!

23:06.480 --> 23:08.640
I don't think they're chewing gum,
Agnes!

23:08.640 --> 23:10.760
They're French Letters. Jaysus!

23:13.040 --> 23:16.640
What's she doing, wearing them?

23:16.640 --> 23:19.120
They're not for her,
they're for him.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.600
That's the thing nowadays.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.920
Girls do buy them, keep them handy.
Sensible I say.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.880
I've never used one, Winnie.
No? No.

23:27.880 --> 23:32.600
Redser wouldn't, he said it'd be
like having a bath with his socks
on.

23:32.600 --> 23:36.520
I'd have been happy
if he just had the feckin' bath!

23:39.280 --> 23:42.280
Oh, look at that Winnie. Ah-choo!

23:42.280 --> 23:46.480
That's disgusting Agnes!

23:46.480 --> 23:48.560
Here, look,
what do you think of this?

23:51.440 --> 23:53.640
I see he's a large!

23:56.080 --> 23:57.560
Next patient please!

24:00.520 --> 24:02.480
Oh, Winnie, I remember one night,

24:02.480 --> 24:06.160
me and Redser walking
along the beach in Portmarnock.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.640
He started chasing me
into the sand dunes.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.400
So I was there
pretending to run.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.080
And he caught me
and he threw me on the sand.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.080
So I was lying there
and I said, "What do you want?"

24:18.480 --> 24:23.960
And he said, "I want your knickers
around your ankles!"

24:23.960 --> 24:26.720
I had to get them out of me feckin'
handbag and put them on!

24:36.240 --> 24:41.120
Then he starts to...
And I go, "Will ya stop it?"

24:41.120 --> 24:45.080
Why?
He was flicking sand up me arse!

24:45.080 --> 24:51.320
There was a sandcastle there
when I was finished!

24:51.320 --> 24:55.520
Those were the days!
Those were the feckin' days!

24:55.520 --> 24:59.400
Winnie, imagine looking at a man's
willy wrapped in one of them.

24:59.400 --> 25:03.280
It'd look like a little bank robber.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.080
With one eye!

25:08.040 --> 25:10.120
Gimme the fuckin' money!

25:12.440 --> 25:14.680
Look who's here for a cup of tea!

25:21.760 --> 25:23.720
We have to go down the shops.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.520
Don't be so rude, Mammy!

25:25.520 --> 25:28.600
Gimme a second to introduce Winnie.
She's already met him!

25:28.600 --> 25:33.160
Not properly. Mick, this is my
mother's friend Winnie McGoogan.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.000
Hello, Mrs McGoogan. Hello, son!

25:42.440 --> 25:44.080
Hello again, Mrs Brown.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.160
That's a condom on your hand!

26:00.160 --> 26:03.920
Well, you can't be too careful
with some of the wankers
you meet nowadays!

26:07.800 --> 26:11.160
All right, Granddad,
your bath is ready.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.880
Now, you get into that bath
and soak in the bubbles

26:15.880 --> 26:19.920
and just lie back and relax
and let the whole world drift away!

26:19.920 --> 26:22.640
Here, take that with you,
I'll be up in a minute.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.640
Morning Granddad.
I'll look after this!

26:26.640 --> 26:27.920
Mammy, what are you at?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.440
I was only joking!

26:35.040 --> 26:38.040
Shit! Shit! Shit!

26:38.040 --> 26:41.480
One for you
from the insurance company.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.680
And one for me,
from the Bishop's office!

26:44.680 --> 26:48.360
What's that Trevor?
A letter from the Bishop.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.960
They've nothing for me, I'll be here
at least another ten days. Great!

26:51.960 --> 26:55.720
Well, you know what I mean, Trevor.
Well, go ahead Mammy. Read it.

26:55.720 --> 26:57.840
You read it, son.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.080
Dear Mrs Brown, it is the conclusion
of this company

27:03.080 --> 27:07.160
that the insurance claim on the
death of Mr Brown is without
foundation.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.640
Oh, Jesus! No, wait, Mammy.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.280
However, I've been
instructed by my supervisor,

27:12.280 --> 27:15.080
Mr James Nicholson,
to take no further action.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.280
Yes! Yippee! Yes!

27:17.280 --> 27:20.400
Trevor, get the piranha
out of Granddad's bath!

27:20.400 --> 27:23.680
What? I'm joking!

27:23.680 --> 27:25.440
But go up and check that he's OK.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.320
That's fantastic, Mrs Brown.
Isn't it?

27:28.320 --> 27:32.840
Maria, his supervisor's name
is Mr Nicholson.

27:32.840 --> 27:37.040
Your name is Nicholson!
So it is.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.400
Isn't that a coincidence? I'll make
you a cup of tea, Mrs Brown.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.560
I knew those bastards
wouldn't take me on!

27:45.520 --> 27:49.560
It's lovely to have Granddad
back from the dead.
Mrs Brown, would you like a biscuit?

27:49.560 --> 27:56.280
No, thanks love. I'll have a cracker
with some couscous.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.800
What?

28:00.120 --> 28:02.200
People change! Good n...

28:02.200 --> 28:06.960
Maria, don't open the feckin'
fridge!

28:06.960 --> 28:08.120
LARGE EXPLOSION
