- Mm-hmm. Mm?

- Sweetie. It's just...
- Yeah?

00:03.985 --> 00:05.195
The glue is not supposed to

00:05.220 --> 00:06.960
be visible, because
for Sierra's wedding,

00:06.985 --> 00:09.453
we want to have these beautiful
bead balls, not glue balls.

00:09.478 --> 00:10.479
- You know what I mean?
- Hmm. Mm.

00:10.503 --> 00:11.532
Do you think you might be getting to

00:11.556 --> 00:13.586
the danger zone because of
the stress of the wedding?

00:13.610 --> 00:14.655
What are you talking about, danger zone?

00:14.679 --> 00:15.852
You know... You know, the danger zone

00:15.876 --> 00:17.968
where you... you bite
your nails uncontrollably...

00:17.993 --> 00:19.508
until we have to use
the therapy mittens,

00:19.532 --> 00:21.766
then you end up in the
bathtub with a raw turkey,

00:21.791 --> 00:23.757
crying about hosting Friendsgiving?

00:23.782 --> 00:25.349
Did people have a bad time
at that Friendsgiving?

00:25.373 --> 00:26.818
- Do I need to call and like, apologize?
- Oh, no.

00:26.842 --> 00:28.067
No, no, no, everyone loved it.

00:28.092 --> 00:30.249
And I bet Mike just left you
alone, too, huh?

00:30.274 --> 00:31.473
I would've scooped you up,

00:31.498 --> 00:33.398
tucked you into bed,
and just watched you sleep.

00:33.423 --> 00:34.423
Okay.

00:34.448 --> 00:36.749
Uh, b-by the way, Jacob,

00:36.774 --> 00:38.430
- When are your parents back...
- When are your parents coming?

00:38.454 --> 00:39.836
Y-Yeah, I have not heard from them.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.648
- Tomorrow. You knew that.
- Oh. No...

00:41.673 --> 00:43.579
'Cause that's when I get
my goodbye hug from Rio.

00:43.603 --> 00:45.453

Or we could just do a high-five.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.196
- Or a hug.
- Or, like, a... [CLICKS TONGUE] Yeah.

- Hello, everyone.

- Oh.

00:55.244 --> 00:57.243
Pop Pop and Daddy, you're here!

00:57.268 --> 00:58.494
- Hey!
- Rio!

00:58.519 --> 01:01.228
Sorry you had to twist my arm so hard

01:01.253 --> 01:02.329
to get me to this wedding.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.815
- We're just happy you're here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, who is this tall,

01:03.839 --> 01:06.173
lanky, luscious drink of well water?

01:06.198 --> 01:10.603
Oh... [CHUCKLES] this is Rudy.
He is our very lovely squatter.

01:10.628 --> 01:13.087
And, uh, Jacob is
another squatter of ours.

01:13.112 --> 01:15.384
And these are Sierra's parents.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.564
- All of them?
- Yes.

01:16.589 --> 01:19.271
- Nonsense.
- Well, Daddy is Sierra's father.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.115
- Um... Yeah.
- This is Pop Pop, my other father.

01:21.139 --> 01:22.373
- They're no longer exclusive.
- Yeah.

01:22.397 --> 01:24.856
And so there's Pablo,
who's Pop Pop's boyfriend,

01:24.881 --> 01:26.981
and Kristal, who's Sierra's surrogate.

01:27.006 --> 01:28.021
Hi, I'm Jacob.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.441
I thought Anise was the surrogate.

01:29.466 --> 01:30.793
- Well, I...
- Anise was our egg donor.

01:30.817 --> 01:32.154
- So...
- But she couldn't carry Sierra

01:32.178 --> 01:33.697
because her cervix wouldn't stay closed.

01:33.721 --> 01:35.281

- Follow me.
- Welcome.

01:37.366 --> 01:39.598
- I will escort you to your quarters.
- No, no, no. Absolutely.

01:39.622 --> 01:40.772
- Good to see you.
- But if you need anything,

01:40.796 --> 01:43.122
help yourselves, get comfortable.

01:43.147 --> 01:45.575
Oh, wow, okay. Fi... Five more people.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.216
That means just another centerpiece,
which is fine.

01:48.241 --> 01:51.156
I think this many people
might be a fire hazard.

01:51.181 --> 01:52.550
You know, and the house already was,

01:52.574 --> 01:54.205
on its own, kind of a fire hazard.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.471
I'm just gonna let
this roll off my back.

01:59.706 --> 02:01.900

extended family to come.

02:01.925 --> 02:03.447
And they'll be here later today!

02:03.472 --> 02:04.637
It's only 70 people.

Oh? Where are we going?

06:32.220 --> 06:33.726
Well, we're going back
to the house, jackass.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.839
Oh, is that right... jackass? [CHUCKLES]

06:35.864 --> 06:37.042
You want me to move back in, do ya?

06:37.066 --> 06:38.971
In what world would you
not be moving back in?

06:38.996 --> 06:41.268
In the world we lived in,
we've never talked about it.

Look, if you don't want to come home,
then don't come home.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.340
I'm not saying that.

06:45.365 --> 06:46.726
I just... I thought maybe we'd have

06:46.750 --> 06:49.212
- a little, you know, more romance.
- Oh, my God.

Do you need me to get down
on my knees and beg you,

06:51.159 --> 06:53.487
so you can throw fish at
my face and pet my nose?

06:53.512 --> 06:55.876
- Are you jealous of the dolphin?!
- How dare you!

I've never been jealous of
a dolphin in my entire life!

don't mind the out-of-towners.

one thing for me... booty!

I hope you get some.

I think we all want
Brandon to get some booty,

- like a civilized man.
- Me either.

You have to delay two days.

you should calm down!

if whatever I said upset you.

was a universal pet peeve.

10:36.850 --> 10:38.216
How was I to know that "calm down"

10:38.241 --> 10:40.224
is the one phrase in
the English language

10:40.249 --> 10:42.137
that means the opposite of what it says?

to actually calm down?

having a panic attack?

about having excruciating back pain

10:59.264 --> 11:01.674
is that I can't actually get
my fingers quite up to my mouth

It was a smaller fraternity,
only 15, 20 guys.

Listen, I just want
to remind everybody, though,

11:30.926 --> 11:33.402
that what I said was... Was "Calm down,"

11:33.427 --> 11:34.880
- and those two words are not...
- My love.

are rubbing you the wrong way.

and I apologize for lying.

But I just want to
say that there is a line,

11:52.951 --> 11:54.096
and they are close to crossing it.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.531
- Okay.
- That would've crossed it.

- That would have,

11:56.992 --> 11:58.237
but let's not get angry about that,

just posing for photos,

mustache and tell people

13:51.528 --> 13:53.461

basket in a corn field

13:53.486 --> 13:55.542
when he was a baby, bam...
[CLAPS HANDS] three grand.

13:55.566 --> 13:56.604

You can't marry
someone you don't love...

- Listen to two people...

14:04.808 --> 14:05.817
to call off the wedding.

14:05.842 --> 14:07.160

- It's not.

And look, you guys went
through all that trouble

14:10.740 --> 14:13.044
getting everything ready
and making the day perfect for me.

14:13.068 --> 14:14.809
- Don't feel pressured, woman.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.801
Do not feel pressured
because I threw my back out

14:16.826 --> 14:19.965
- and my nails are gnawed to the blood.
- That'll be all healed up in a week.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.615
- We won't even remember those things.
- Yeah, you don't get

14:21.639 --> 14:22.868
married for those reasons.

It's kind of you to say,
but this wedding is happening.

14:25.829 --> 14:27.173
You got to stop her.
Physically stop her.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.374
- Take the dress off her or something.
- Hey.

14:28.398 --> 14:30.877
- I can't do anything because of this.
- Oh, I think we have a winner here.

14:30.901 --> 14:31.901
- This could work.
- No.

Oh, wow, that does look good.

14:34.038 --> 14:36.584
It doesn't' scream "wealth,"
but it relentlessly whispers it

14:36.609 --> 14:38.380
until everyone around
me feels inadequate.

14:38.405 --> 14:40.334
- Sure. Um...
- Okay. No. Nope.

14:40.359 --> 14:42.955
- No. No, no tiara. No. No.
- Wha...

14:42.980 --> 14:43.988
What are you doing?

14:44.013 --> 14:45.856
- Mike, give that back.
- I cannot let you marry

14:45.880 --> 14:48.560
- somebody that you don't love.
- First of all, calm down.

14:48.585 --> 14:49.894
Please don't... You know what?

14:49.919 --> 14:51.031
You're right. It's triggering.

14:51.055 --> 14:52.567
- The "calm down"?
- "Calm down," yes. I'm sorry.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.963
Sierra, you have to have
that foundation of love.

14:55.988 --> 14:57.348
I'll tell you exactly why... One day,

14:57.372 --> 14:58.517
you're gonna walk into your kitchen,

14:58.541 --> 14:59.932
you're gonna notice every
single drawer's open.

14:59.956 --> 15:01.361
Why? Did someone ransack it? No!

- ... or close cupboard doors.
- I forget.

15:04.758 --> 15:06.945
But I can live with it
because I love her.

15:06.970 --> 15:08.570

15:08.595 --> 15:10.026
he only brushes his
teeth in the morning.

15:10.050 --> 15:11.006
Doesn't do it at night,

meal that he's ever eaten.

I don't ring this guy,
I don't murder him

15:15.101 --> 15:18.856
because I am wildly and madly
in love with all of him.
