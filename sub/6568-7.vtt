God, that is really bad.

00:09.603 --> 00:11.363
Can't we get this shit
out of here?

00:11.398 --> 00:12.866
Not until the shutdown is over.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.567
<i>- The garbage collection is suspended...

- Wait, what?

00:16.404 --> 00:18.839
- ( Scoffs )
- Did I hear the VP scream?

00:18.873 --> 00:22.342
No, that was me.
And it was a shout.

00:22.376 --> 00:24.278
There was a rat on the garbage,

00:24.312 --> 00:26.113
so I shouted to scare it off.

00:26.147 --> 00:29.584
- That was a man's voice?
- Yeah, 'cause I'm a man.

00:29.618 --> 00:32.087
I have a man's voice.

00:32.121 --> 00:34.423
Yeah, that's right.
Walk away.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.592
Walk away.

00:57.718 --> 01:00.387
Okay, guys, I'm not

01:00.421 --> 01:01.554
We're in shutdown mode.

01:01.589 --> 01:03.423
I've got to have
a skeleton staff.

01:03.457 --> 01:05.292
- So Keith stays, right?
- What?

01:05.325 --> 01:07.762
Keith. He's skinny
like a skeleton.

01:07.796 --> 01:09.664
Ma'am, please.
I can't afford to be furloughed.

01:09.698 --> 01:11.966
- No, you're not. But, Dan, you are.
- Ma'am.

01:12.001 --> 01:14.136
Yeah, you know,
you two do similar jobs.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.971
It just makes economic sense
for you to go, Dan.

01:16.005 --> 01:17.506
Does that mean he makes
more money than I do?

- Is that correct?
- Today, yes.

01:22.513 --> 01:23.947
So I'm gonna shut down
the shutdown.

01:24.015 --> 01:25.515
Gary: It looks like it's
between you and me.

01:25.550 --> 01:27.150
Without me, this office
will implode.

01:27.185 --> 01:29.787
Gary, the Secret Service is
calling you Girly Shirley Temple.

01:29.821 --> 01:30.988
- So you need to just cut...
- Sue.

01:31.023 --> 01:32.023
- Yeah?
- You're going home.

01:32.057 --> 01:33.224
Oh!

01:33.259 --> 01:36.461
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Fine.

01:36.496 --> 01:38.664
I need a moment.
( Crying )

01:38.698 --> 01:41.066
Oh, man, that's tough.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.435
Oh, my God.
I feel so bad for her.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.137
- Come on, she had to go.
- Poor Sue.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.406
- Poor Sue.
- I guess I'll be heading out.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.844
Okay. I need to remind you you cannot
make work-related contact with anyone

01:50.878 --> 01:53.280
from this administration
and you're forbidden by law

01:53.314 --> 01:55.382
from entering
the West Wing or EEOB.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.285
Actually, you did not
need to remind me of that.

01:57.319 --> 01:59.387
- I know, but I wanted to.
- Laters.

01:59.421 --> 02:01.022
Wow, he's taking that well.

02:01.056 --> 02:02.991
He's like Spock.
He doesn't show his emotions.

02:03.025 --> 02:04.926
- Ever?
- Ever.

02:04.961 --> 02:06.795
Ever?

02:06.830 --> 02:08.964
- No, not even then.
- You're kidding me.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.532
I saw him laugh once
really hard

02:10.567 --> 02:12.435
when the security guy
fell off his Segway.

02:13.537 --> 02:15.972
Is laughter an emotion?

02:16.006 --> 02:18.141
Full day spa package.

02:18.175 --> 02:19.976
No, I think you'll find
it is possible.

Can you set up a lunch with him?
Great.

02:26.751 --> 02:29.119
No, no, no.
Just browsing the store of life.

02:36.661 --> 02:38.996
I want people to be sick
of the sight of my face.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.597
Very funny, Carl.

02:40.631 --> 02:42.666
Gary, I don't know
how to do that.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.234
Oh, ma'am. Oh, oh, oh. Sorry.

02:45.269 --> 02:47.470
Andrew donating to both parties
is all over the blogs.

02:47.504 --> 02:50.239
- Who the hell keeps stirring the shit pot?
- Both: Roger Furlong.

02:50.307 --> 02:52.408
Thought that, too.
So obvious, Furlong.

02:52.475 --> 02:54.243
Wow, it's like anal leakage.

02:54.277 --> 02:56.879
The donations, the shitty
book about me and Andrew

02:56.913 --> 02:58.314
having some sort
of fake relationship,

02:58.348 --> 03:01.016
the land deal
from, like, ages ago.

03:01.051 --> 03:03.885
Somebody bring me the chinless
head of Roger Furlong.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.355
Well, in the acknowledgments,
the author says...

03:06.389 --> 03:08.024
Why do you have a copy of that?

03:08.058 --> 03:09.825
So I can refute it to people.
It's my refuting copy.

03:09.859 --> 03:11.527
Get rid of it.
Refuse it.

03:11.561 --> 03:13.128
Okay, look, if the VP
did have a window,

03:13.162 --> 03:15.130
it'd be a high one and
she'd push you out of it.

03:15.165 --> 03:17.933
- Ooh, that's very good.
- I'm doing my impression of Sue.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.336
- Yeah, that's very good.
- What?

03:20.370 --> 03:23.672
You're pregnant? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I did not mean that.

03:23.707 --> 03:26.108
Listen, if you call next week, I
can probably fit you in, okay?

03:26.143 --> 03:27.777

03:37.088 --> 03:39.055
Innit, though?
Huh?

03:39.090 --> 03:40.490
Are you going to the G8
conference in London?

03:40.525 --> 03:43.027
Yes, I am, Gary.
Thank you for asking.

03:43.061 --> 03:44.762
Yes, I am.

03:44.796 --> 03:48.065
It is a city where women
are literally drunk all day.

03:48.100 --> 03:51.069
And I am going to mind
their gaps, my friend.

03:51.103 --> 03:54.506
But I need my passport renewed,
so can I speak to the veep?

03:54.540 --> 03:56.608
Why do you need her for that?

03:56.642 --> 03:59.711
Well, cum-for-brains,
the government is shut down,

03:59.746 --> 04:01.780
so all the passport
offices are closed.

04:01.815 --> 04:03.382
So I need Selina
to pull some strings for me.

04:03.416 --> 04:06.251
So get Sue.

04:06.286 --> 04:08.854
Where's Sue?
Where's Sue?

04:08.888 --> 04:11.289
Who's the new Sue?
Me.

04:12.492 --> 04:14.159
Would you like
an appointment, Mr. Ryan?

04:14.194 --> 04:16.928
Uh, yes, new Sue, I would
like to make an appointment.

04:16.997 --> 04:19.165
- Suck it.
- Ha ha!

I don't know my own party.

04:32.947 --> 04:34.882
You don't want to see
a dick in hi-def.

04:34.916 --> 04:37.117
How can they allow
this shutdown to happen?

04:37.151 --> 04:39.219
Do Washington's
overpaid lawmakers

04:39.287 --> 04:40.921
<i>not care about ordinary people?</i>

04:40.955 --> 04:42.656
What?
I'm not overpaid.

04:42.690 --> 04:45.292
I'm independently wealthy.
All right? Sorry.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.861
They need to cut a deal
and vanquish the stench.

04:47.895 --> 04:51.264
Ma'am, the stench
at your home is gone.

04:51.298 --> 04:53.099

- What?

04:53.134 --> 04:55.902
You know that stinky garbage
outside your home?

04:55.936 --> 04:58.906
I, as Sue, had a private
company take it away.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.941
What?
Why would you do that?

05:00.975 --> 05:02.809
<i>Amy: That was not a
good idea, Gary.</i>

05:02.844 --> 05:04.945

05:04.979 --> 05:06.613
Come on, Gary.
Everybody in Garbagetown

05:06.647 --> 05:08.615
has to live with the stink
except for the...

05:08.649 --> 05:12.118
( feminine British accent ) uppity
princess in her perfumed palace.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.120
Is what other people would say.

05:14.155 --> 05:15.889
I'm not saying that.
Not me.

05:15.923 --> 05:17.523
Wait a minute, hold on now.

05:17.558 --> 05:20.192
So now some private contractor

05:20.260 --> 05:21.594
who has not been vetted

05:21.628 --> 05:23.663
could go through
all of my trash

05:23.697 --> 05:25.398
and put it up on the...

05:25.466 --> 05:27.900
on the Internet?

05:27.935 --> 05:29.502
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't mean to do that.

05:29.536 --> 05:31.437
You've got to go and get
the garbage bags back.

05:31.471 --> 05:34.673
Okay. Yes, ma'am. Wait, how am I
gonna know which bags are yours?

05:36.576 --> 05:39.645
Do you want to let me know some of
the things that are in the bags?

05:39.679 --> 05:42.080
Ahem, can I just... can I talk to
you privately just for a second?

05:42.115 --> 05:44.049
Yeah, sure.

05:46.218 --> 05:47.385
<i>- ( Door closes )

Selina: So me and the Speaker,
I think we're gonna end this.

06:13.312 --> 06:15.513
Well, POTUS knows we have
to get out of shutdown ASAP.

06:15.548 --> 06:17.182
It's fucking us all
every which way.

06:17.216 --> 06:19.785
Yeah.
Speaking of which...

06:19.819 --> 06:21.620
Ma'am?

06:21.654 --> 06:25.625
Um, I've been seeing Andrew.

06:27.061 --> 06:28.628
Seeing him?

06:28.662 --> 06:32.299
Like you would see someone for
lunch or a game of cards?

06:32.334 --> 06:34.068
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.638
I mean, we've been having lunch
and then we've been having sex.

06:37.706 --> 06:39.440
And not really cards so much.

06:39.474 --> 06:41.542
Just, you know,
just, like, sex.

06:41.576 --> 06:43.544
Oh, God, Amy.
Can you tell me what to do?

06:43.578 --> 06:45.046
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.349
You dump him overboard
like the toxic waste he is.

06:48.383 --> 06:50.718
- He will kill your career.
- Come on, Amy.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.755
It is just so good.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.491
You just have no idea.
And it's stress relief.

06:56.526 --> 06:58.327
You know, endorphins.

06:58.361 --> 07:01.664
Okay, then you see...
see where it goes.

07:01.698 --> 07:04.433
- No, I have to end it.
- Yeah.

07:04.468 --> 07:06.668
But I can't.

I don't actually have
to touch the trash, do I?

07:19.215 --> 07:20.849
Yes, you've got to embrace it.

07:20.883 --> 07:22.684
You've got to help me get the
garbage, put it in your car.

07:22.718 --> 07:24.786
We'll take it to the residence and
I'll help you get a passport.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.621
So you're the guys
who want your trash back?

07:26.655 --> 07:28.055
- Yeah. Are you Mr. Walker?
- Yes.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.757

- So, our trash?
- Your trash?

07:34.296 --> 07:36.097
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's mine now.

07:36.131 --> 07:38.833
- Oh.
- So what's my end?

07:38.867 --> 07:40.368
Okay, sir, this is
a government matter,

07:40.402 --> 07:42.536
so it would be best
if you cooperated.

07:42.571 --> 07:44.238
Are you threatening me,
Pez head?

07:44.272 --> 07:46.807
Because we got a compactor
that takes shit

07:46.842 --> 07:48.375
and turns it into cubes.

07:48.410 --> 07:49.910
Okay.
( Laughs )

07:49.945 --> 07:52.379
Could you just excuse us for one moment?
Thank you so much.

07:52.414 --> 07:54.648
( Laughs ) What the hell
are you doing?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.416
We have to offer him something.

07:56.451 --> 07:58.485
Why don't you offer to blow him
over by the recycled glass?

07:58.520 --> 07:59.954
It would throw up some
interesting light effects.

07:59.988 --> 08:01.589
That would be romantic,
wouldn't it?

08:01.623 --> 08:04.091
It's a shame you're
not going to London.

08:04.126 --> 08:06.193
Okay, fine.
You know what?

08:06.228 --> 08:08.062
I'm gonna offer him
a tour of the West Wing.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.130
Civilians love that shit.

08:10.164 --> 08:12.299
They get so hot for it,
I call it the Wet Wing.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.234
- Okay, that's disrespectful.
- It's a building, Gary.

08:14.268 --> 08:16.435
- It doesn't have feelings.
- It has a spirit.

08:16.503 --> 08:20.105
No, it doesn't.
Sir, Mr. Walsh and I

08:20.140 --> 08:21.974

Oh, wait.
Did I say fun?

What would you like?

08:32.618 --> 08:35.086

- Oh.
- I'd like to have her take a tour.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.157

08:50.703 --> 08:52.070
how nice this office was, Jim.

08:52.104 --> 08:53.638
It is nice, isn't it?

08:53.673 --> 08:55.640
These chairs
are worth a fortune.

08:55.675 --> 08:57.742
- Are they?
- Uncomfortable as hell, though.

08:57.776 --> 08:59.611
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?</i>

08:59.645 --> 09:02.547
Well, people in the old days lived
in discomfort most of the time.

09:02.581 --> 09:05.149
<i>- Oh, well, that's true.
- They were laced into their clothing.</i>

09:05.184 --> 09:06.984
Freezing cold or hot as hell.

09:07.019 --> 09:10.288
- Hard chairs and they all stank.
- Tough times. Tough times.

09:10.322 --> 09:13.024
- Yeah, and I'm just talking about the 1970s.
- Okay.

09:13.059 --> 09:15.627
I'm not. I was thinking
of the 18th century.

09:15.662 --> 09:18.764
<i>- The wigs, so on.
- All right.</i>

09:18.798 --> 09:22.401
So I think we're pretty close
on a budget deal here.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.237
I think we just need you
to move a scooch more.

09:25.271 --> 09:27.506
- Oh, I'm not moving.
- You're not moving?

09:27.540 --> 09:30.910
Not with you, ma'am.
You have been hung out to dry.

09:30.978 --> 09:32.645
I just got a call
from "Politico."

09:32.679 --> 09:35.948
They just did an interview with the
president and they called for my reaction.

09:35.983 --> 09:37.750
Just now?
What are you talking about?

09:37.785 --> 09:40.620
- Do you not know? You haven't. All right.
- I have not seen...

09:40.654 --> 09:44.690
I will read the president's
words without inflection.

09:44.825 --> 09:46.826
"Slide to unlock."

09:46.860 --> 09:51.164
"Selina Meyer is a feisty
operator and a fine VP.

09:51.198 --> 09:53.900
<i>She tried her best
to prevent this shutdown,</i>

09:53.934 --> 09:57.203
working long hours,
but it was a tough call."

09:57.238 --> 10:00.774
Subtext, ma'am...
you failed.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.644
And you are being blamed personally
for this government shutdown.

10:03.678 --> 10:06.280
Okay, first of all, I did
not hear that subtext.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.282
I hear text,
and the text that I hear

10:09.317 --> 10:12.686
is a feisty and successful VP.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.921
Oh, I don't think
he said successful.

10:13.955 --> 10:15.556
Oh, I know he said successful.

10:15.590 --> 10:16.757
Well, that wasn't
in those words.

10:16.791 --> 10:18.358
That's what you
just read to me.

10:18.392 --> 10:20.660
- I'm sorry.
- Feel free. Yeah, read it back.

10:20.694 --> 10:22.962
"Selina Meyer is a feisty
operator and a fine VP."

10:22.996 --> 10:25.231
- No successful.
- Fine and successful are synonyms.

10:25.265 --> 10:27.766
- You're grasping at straws.
- I'm not grasping for straws.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.035
What with this

10:30.069 --> 10:32.104
and with all those stories
about your ex-husband,

10:32.138 --> 10:34.072
there's a lot of poison coming

10:34.107 --> 10:37.209
from certain enemy congressmen.

10:37.244 --> 10:39.445
Roger Furlong?

10:39.479 --> 10:41.614
If you say so.
It's all beans to me.

10:41.648 --> 10:45.017
Madam Vice President, you have been
squeezed out of the budget deal.

10:45.051 --> 10:47.953
It's tough, but I don't care.

10:47.988 --> 10:50.056
Now you see why
we have the hard chairs.

10:50.090 --> 10:52.358
Hardly worth you sitting down.

10:52.392 --> 10:54.426
You know, Jim,

10:54.494 --> 10:57.362
you're a lot older than me.

10:57.397 --> 11:00.665
If you die within
the next six years,

11:00.700 --> 11:03.601
I will be attending
your funeral

11:03.636 --> 11:07.839
and giving a eulogy when POTUS
sends me there in his stead.

11:07.873 --> 11:10.775
And it is gonna be
full of subtext.

11:10.843 --> 11:14.379
Chock-full of subtext.

11:14.447 --> 11:17.382
Well, I look forward to that.
Oh, wait, I'll be dead.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.919
Dan: Honestly, Sidney, I'm
looking at being furloughed

11:19.953 --> 11:21.421
- as an opportunity.
- Oh, yeah.

11:21.455 --> 11:24.591
Get out there, touch some
bases, face some faces.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.226
So what you're saying is
your career has stalled.

11:26.260 --> 11:27.928
So now you and your slack pussy

11:27.962 --> 11:30.564
want to make big bucks
as an oil lobbyist, right?

11:30.598 --> 11:31.831
- Welcome, gentlemen.
- Hello.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.099
Today's specials
are the cuttlefish...

11:33.134 --> 11:35.001
Let me stop you
right there, sweetheart.

11:35.036 --> 11:37.504
- You're gonna pick up the tab, right?
- Yes, that's on me.

11:37.538 --> 11:38.839
Great. I'm gonna have
the most expensive starter,

11:38.873 --> 11:42.242
the most expensive entrée,
and a $200 bottle of champagne.

11:42.277 --> 11:45.579
- Yes, sir.
- You know, I think I'm gonna keep it light.

11:45.613 --> 11:48.515
I'm gonna go chicken
salad and a Diet Coke.

11:48.550 --> 11:50.885
Nonsense. Give him
exactly what I'm having.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.452
<i>And we will split
the champagne.</i>

11:52.487 --> 11:54.454
It's our first date.

11:56.557 --> 12:00.860
My husband was killed 15 yards
from a ranger's station.

12:00.895 --> 12:03.496
This is the most
fucked-up story.

12:03.530 --> 12:05.598
I mean, killed by a bear?

12:05.633 --> 12:08.202
<i>Reporter: No park rangers on
site due to the shutdown.</i>

12:08.236 --> 12:09.303
And a black bear.
That's the weird part.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.105
They rarely attack people.
That's weird.

12:11.139 --> 12:13.775
Right. That's what I was...
then he must have goaded him.

12:13.809 --> 12:17.045
He must have hit him with a
stick or done something stupid.

12:17.079 --> 12:19.047
Taunting him or forcing
the bear to dance.

12:19.081 --> 12:21.383
<i>- Bears don't like to dance.
- Would you dance, please?</i>

12:21.418 --> 12:23.785
- There's not a happy bear in show business.
- Or he tried to fuck the bear.

12:23.853 --> 12:26.656
<i>- Mike: He tried to fuck...
- Like Grizzly Adams.</i>

12:26.723 --> 12:29.025
<i>- Amy: Oh, jeez.
- Enjoying yourselves?</i>

12:29.059 --> 12:30.493
<i>- We were.
- Are you laughing</i>

12:30.528 --> 12:32.328
at the violent death
of a young man?

12:32.363 --> 12:36.166
- Yeah, pretty much.
- I thought you were on furlough, Kent.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.967
Forgot my noise-cancelling
headphones.

12:38.002 --> 12:40.070
Guess what I just heard.

12:40.104 --> 12:42.472
I'm not here.
Ergo, my ears aren't here either.

12:42.506 --> 12:44.975
Okay.
POTUS's quote

12:45.009 --> 12:47.778
in his soon-to-be-released
"Politico" interview

12:47.812 --> 12:51.682
in which he blames me
for the government shutdown.

12:51.716 --> 12:53.116
- What?
- Exactly. What?

12:53.151 --> 12:55.052
<i>- It was implicit.
- Implicit?</i>

12:55.119 --> 12:57.722
Implicit like
a "kick me" sticker

12:57.756 --> 12:59.557
on my keister
would be implicit?

12:59.591 --> 13:01.693
Madam Vice President,
greatest respect,

13:01.727 --> 13:04.262
but it has been the job
of the VP over the ages

13:04.296 --> 13:06.931
to take it in the ass
to save the president.

13:06.965 --> 13:08.232
Yeah, let me
tell you something.

13:08.266 --> 13:10.601
This ass is closed
for business.

13:10.635 --> 13:13.436
This ass is in clench-down.
I don't want to be a decoy.

13:13.471 --> 13:16.072
Let the president take it in the ass.
He might like it.

13:16.107 --> 13:17.874
<i>Woman on TV: These
powerful men and women,</i>

13:17.908 --> 13:20.943
they couldn't agree
on anything.

13:20.977 --> 13:22.678
<i>Selina: You've got
to be kidding me.</i>

13:22.713 --> 13:24.547
Now I'm to blame
because some goober

13:24.581 --> 13:26.282
got all eaten up by a bear?

13:26.316 --> 13:28.150
You've got to get your
press guys on this, okay?

13:28.185 --> 13:31.153
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am, this is in Minnesota, right?

13:31.187 --> 13:33.322
So Governor Chung
is gonna be all over this

13:33.356 --> 13:34.991
- like a bear on an idiot.
- Of course. That's right.

13:35.025 --> 13:37.660
At the very least, let's
get in front of something

13:37.694 --> 13:39.529
and get in touch
with this widow.

13:39.563 --> 13:41.665
- Yeah. Did you hear that, Mike?
- Uh-uh.

13:41.699 --> 13:43.300
The bear widow.
Get in touch with the bear widow.

13:43.334 --> 13:44.668
As well as get in touch
with the press guys?

13:44.702 --> 13:46.235
Yeah, as well as get
in touch with the press guys.

13:46.270 --> 13:48.337
Two things. Call the "Guinness
Book of World Records."

13:48.372 --> 13:51.173
Oh, no, no, don't, don't, because
that would be three things.

13:52.609 --> 13:54.609
So you're really not
gonna eat that lobster?

13:54.644 --> 13:55.644
Oh, no, I hate lobster.

13:55.678 --> 13:58.112
You know, Dan,
we could use you.

13:58.147 --> 13:59.614
How do you feel about swindling

13:59.648 --> 14:02.383
a bunch of sister fuckers
out of their land in Nebraska?

14:02.417 --> 14:05.019
We're trying to skirt a
pipeline through their backyard

14:05.054 --> 14:06.688
and they're not a fan
for some reason.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.456
You want to get rid
of some farm folk, huh?

14:08.490 --> 14:11.359
Consider me your well-groomed
dust bowl, my friend.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.661
Hey, ooh!
Boy, you made it twitch.

14:13.696 --> 14:15.530
But if you really want
to make my dick dance,

14:15.564 --> 14:17.866
why don't you tell me what's
going on in the VP's office?

14:19.702 --> 14:22.905
Well, you know, I can't
really be too specific.

14:22.939 --> 14:24.406
Sure, sure.
No, we can...

14:24.441 --> 14:26.409
why don't we come up
with some kind of code?

14:26.443 --> 14:29.479
Here, the VP will be
the lobster.

14:29.513 --> 14:32.015
Amy, greens.
We'll call Mike carrots.

14:32.049 --> 14:33.349
Dan, you can be shrimp.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.618
Do you see what I did there, Dan?
I made you shrimp.

14:35.653 --> 14:38.755
Boy, I just wish I ordered
a plate of useless assholes.

14:38.789 --> 14:41.858
But you go to war with
the army you have, right?

14:41.893 --> 14:43.727
Okay, I think the lobster

14:43.761 --> 14:45.696
is getting back together
with her ex-husband.

14:45.730 --> 14:49.299
The greens are only
barely keeping it together.

14:49.334 --> 14:53.737
Mike... the carrots
are drowning in debt.

14:53.772 --> 14:57.708
And this little shrimp wants to
hear more about this Nebraska deal.

14:57.743 --> 14:59.611
( Laughs ) Want to go
to the corn belt, do you?

14:59.645 --> 15:01.446
I want to hit it.
I want to hit it hard for you.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.648
Well, tap your
ruby slippers together

15:03.683 --> 15:06.184
and wake the fuck up.
There is no job, Dorothy.

15:06.218 --> 15:08.453
But I'm very impressed
that you would turn on

15:08.487 --> 15:11.189
all of your compadres there in
the vice president's office.

15:11.224 --> 15:14.592
So why don't you take your little vanilla
Thriller dance over to Danny Chung?

15:14.627 --> 15:18.329
He's the shiny turd rising to
the top of the bowl right now.

15:18.363 --> 15:20.264
You like turds, don't you, Dan?

15:20.299 --> 15:23.234
Yeah.
No, no, no, no.

15:23.268 --> 15:25.836
That's really not what I meant.
You misunderstood, honestly.

15:25.871 --> 15:29.640
When I said fault, I meant that
it wasn't your husband's fault

15:29.707 --> 15:33.143
because bears
are naturally hungry.

15:33.210 --> 15:35.078
Does that make sense?

15:35.112 --> 15:37.580
Hello?
Hello?

15:38.783 --> 15:40.416
Oh, was that
Mrs. Doolittle?

15:40.451 --> 15:41.951
- Yeah.
- And?

15:42.019 --> 15:43.886
- Very emotional.
- Well, of course.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.788
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:45.822 --> 15:47.656
What?
Oh, Jesus.

15:47.691 --> 15:49.525
All right, Amy, we're
gonna have to get Dan

15:49.559 --> 15:51.795
to go to Minnesota,
do some widow work.

15:51.829 --> 15:54.731
- Dan's on furlough.
- Yeah, I know he's fucking furloughed

15:54.766 --> 15:56.333
because I'm the fucker
who furloughed him.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.401
And by the way, where is Gary?

15:58.436 --> 15:59.936
He's still getting the garbage.

15:59.971 --> 16:01.438
Well, okay,
if he's not back soon,

16:01.539 --> 16:03.240
we're gonna have
to unenfurlough Sue.

16:03.274 --> 16:04.641
Unenfur...

16:04.675 --> 16:06.309
<i>- we'll have to get Sue back.
- Amy: Okay.</i>

16:06.343 --> 16:09.112
Yeah. And I want to
meet with Furlong.

16:12.116 --> 16:13.649
It's not happening.
I'm not getting in there.

16:13.684 --> 16:14.951
Unbelievable.

16:15.019 --> 16:16.987
Oh, God!

16:17.021 --> 16:20.256
Oh, please. Please.
You think this is bad?

16:20.291 --> 16:23.760
Wait till you get to London.
Everything smells like urine.

16:23.827 --> 16:25.394
Even the food.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.296
Okay, found it.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.198
- How do you know it's hers?
- Shut up. I found it.

16:32.402 --> 16:35.538
<i>Selina: Oh, my God,
that pizza was good.</i>

16:35.573 --> 16:37.374
You know, I don't eat
pizza very much, Roger.

16:37.408 --> 16:40.543
But when I do, it just
makes me so fucking happy.

16:40.578 --> 16:43.713
- Thank the Chinese for that.
- What?

16:43.748 --> 16:45.682
- The Chinese invented pizza.
- No, they didn't.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.750
- Yeah, they did.
- Listen, Roger,

16:47.785 --> 16:50.419
let's talk about all these
stories going around

16:50.454 --> 16:53.523
about Andrew's land deal
and our relationship.

16:53.557 --> 16:56.191
Oh, my God, all these
whispers, these rumors.

16:56.226 --> 16:57.793
Who knows where
any of that's coming from?

16:57.827 --> 17:00.762
The point is there's boxes and
boxes of this stuff out there.

17:00.797 --> 17:02.464
- I know that. That's a fact.
- Uh-huh.

17:02.498 --> 17:05.099
That's as much a fact
as Will's impotence.

17:05.135 --> 17:07.236
I don't think
that's appropriate.

17:07.304 --> 17:08.771
He doesn't mind.
Do you, Will?

17:08.806 --> 17:10.073
Whatever works, sir.

17:10.107 --> 17:12.041
<i>- Right, see? Team player.
- Yeah.</i>

17:12.077 --> 17:16.413
Yeah, I got a pretty impressive
deck of cards here, ma'am.

17:16.448 --> 17:17.882
No kidding.
I love to play cards.

17:17.915 --> 17:19.250
<i>- Do you?
- Yeah.</i>

17:19.284 --> 17:21.152
- What's your favorite game?
- Shanghai.

17:21.185 --> 17:23.588
I would have guessed Old Maid.

17:23.622 --> 17:25.323
- Want to play Go Fish?
- Sure.

17:25.357 --> 17:27.125
- Why don't you lay 'em out?
- All right.

17:27.159 --> 17:29.694
Queen.
The boxes I just mentioned.

17:29.728 --> 17:31.229
- Uh-huh.
- Boxes full of dirt.

17:31.263 --> 17:33.899
- Right.
- Explosive dirt. Hurty dirt.

17:33.933 --> 17:36.635
Yeah, you can start calling me
the Hurty Dirty Man.

17:36.669 --> 17:38.170
Yeah, I'm not
gonna call you that.

17:38.204 --> 17:39.938
- All right.
- ( Laughs )

17:39.973 --> 17:42.207
I'm not.
What's your king?

17:42.242 --> 17:43.943
Could be Chung time.

17:43.977 --> 17:45.711
Everybody Dan Chung tonight.

17:45.746 --> 17:47.447
Danny likes boxes.

17:48.482 --> 17:50.050
And then?

17:50.084 --> 17:52.452
Well, I can't
predict the future.

17:52.487 --> 17:54.220
Ooh!
( Laughs )

17:54.255 --> 17:58.024
Roger Furlong, look
at you being all coy.

17:58.059 --> 17:59.759
- ( Laughs )
- You are, man.

17:59.794 --> 18:02.029
You're a coy boy.
So what?

18:02.063 --> 18:04.665
You'd make some sort of a deal with him?
Is that what you're thinking?

18:04.699 --> 18:08.234
For some sort of senior
position in his administration?

18:08.269 --> 18:10.202
- Stranger things have happened.
- Uh-huh.

18:10.237 --> 18:11.737
Stranger things could happen.

18:11.771 --> 18:13.739
- Boom.
- Boom.

18:13.774 --> 18:15.441
You want to make
a deal with me?

18:15.475 --> 18:17.910
Have a place in my
future administration?

18:17.944 --> 18:20.879
Wow, that came out of
nowhere, didn't it, Will?

18:20.914 --> 18:24.115
It's like a sudden
monsoon in Goa, sir.

18:24.150 --> 18:27.852
Sudden monsoon. They predict those
things weeks in advance, you idiot.

18:29.355 --> 18:30.855
Hey, did you ever see
"Silence of the Lambs"?

18:30.890 --> 18:34.559
Oh, yeah. That scared the
living shit out of me.

18:34.593 --> 18:37.729
I know, it's hard to believe that
they have female FBI agents.

18:37.763 --> 18:39.031
- Oh!
- I'm kidding.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.399
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

18:40.466 --> 18:42.468
( Laughs ) I love that kind
of misogyny.

18:42.502 --> 18:45.004
- I love misogyny like that.
- Yeah, it's the best kind.

18:45.038 --> 18:46.539
Well, anyway,
the point is you got

18:46.573 --> 18:48.241
- these two characters, right?
- Right.

18:48.275 --> 18:51.077
That seem to be so different, but
they can come to an understanding

18:51.111 --> 18:52.645
and they can actually
work together.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.614
You know what?
You make such a good point.

18:54.648 --> 18:56.583
You make such a good point.

18:56.617 --> 19:00.386
Ahem.
Just to be clear, Roger,

19:00.421 --> 19:02.922
you're not asking for anything

19:02.956 --> 19:05.858
and I'm not agreeing
to anything.

19:05.892 --> 19:07.593
Okay.

19:07.627 --> 19:10.696
Obviously, I can't say
anything explicitly.

19:10.730 --> 19:13.533
Neither can you.
You understand that?

19:13.634 --> 19:15.635
Will, do I understand?

19:16.570 --> 19:17.970
Yes, you do, sir.

19:19.172 --> 19:20.606
Did you hear
what we said, Will?

19:20.641 --> 19:23.009
No, ma'am.

19:23.043 --> 19:24.510
- Team player.
- Yeah.

19:24.545 --> 19:26.145
- I like it.
- Yeah.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.681
All right, she's on her way, so
we'll just put this in her car.

19:28.716 --> 19:31.818
- Did you check the oil?
- No. Who the fuck checks their oil?

19:31.852 --> 19:33.920
- Everyone.
- ( Horn honks )

19:33.955 --> 19:36.056
<i>- Oh, hey, Sue's here.
- Oh, thank God.</i>

19:36.090 --> 19:38.625
- Thanks, Sue.
- You're welcome, Gary.

19:38.659 --> 19:39.659
- Hi, Shaun.
- Hey, gentlemen.

19:39.694 --> 19:40.828
- Nice to see you.
- Sue, grab a bag.

19:40.862 --> 19:42.663
We're gonna be
the shitty Sopranos.

19:42.697 --> 19:44.298
Just don't get
any mess on my dress.

19:44.332 --> 19:46.933
My mess on your dress.
I like this... sorry.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.602
You're paying to have
my car cleaned after this.

19:48.636 --> 19:50.537
Okay, first, no touching.
Thank you. And I'm not.

19:50.571 --> 19:52.405
<i>Sue: Okay, come on.
Let's get this over with.</i>

19:52.440 --> 19:54.541
Oh, God, there's no way
I'm gonna fit in here.

19:54.575 --> 19:57.811
It's bigger than your mother's womb and
you were in there till you were 15.

19:57.846 --> 20:00.381
<i>- Gary: Oh, my God.
- There you go.</i>

20:00.415 --> 20:02.483
Oh, God, I'm touching it.

20:02.518 --> 20:04.152
<i>Gary: Something's wet.
Something's wet.</i>

20:04.186 --> 20:05.787
- Ugh, okay.
- Jonah: It got on my ID badge.

20:05.821 --> 20:07.856
- Shaun: Watch your legs, Lurch.
- Sue: All right, guys.

20:07.890 --> 20:11.794
<i>- Jonah: Who buys a coupe?
- Sue: Oh, gross.</i>

20:13.763 --> 20:16.331
People will say
he shouldn't have been there.

20:16.366 --> 20:18.367
<i>But he's dead, for God's sake.</i>

20:18.401 --> 20:20.102
<i>- I know.
- ( Crying )</i>

20:20.136 --> 20:21.770
I know. I know.
I know.

20:21.805 --> 20:25.441
I keep thinking
about his last moments.

20:25.476 --> 20:27.176
Yeah.

20:27.211 --> 20:29.445
Chung: So how is the
widow holding up?

20:29.480 --> 20:32.716
She's crying a lot.
Like a shitload a lot.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.218
She's upset.
Husband eaten, et cetera.

20:35.252 --> 20:37.453
She's a big fan of yours, though.
You should talk to her.

20:37.488 --> 20:40.856
I don't know.
It could look opportunistic.

20:40.890 --> 20:43.993
But heroes don't get to
choose, they get chosen.

20:44.027 --> 20:47.430
Speaking of chosen,
how is Dan.com/Egan?

20:47.464 --> 20:49.833
- I'm still a fan.
- And you should be, Danny.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.634
- I'm fucking awesome.
- You are.

20:51.669 --> 20:54.671
Sadly, though, Selina and Kent
Davison are blind to my destiny.

20:54.705 --> 20:56.606
See, they're thinking
like it's the 1990s.

20:56.641 --> 20:58.709
I'm thinking like
it's the 2020s.

20:58.743 --> 21:00.077
You got 20/20 vision, huh?

21:00.111 --> 21:01.178
- Zowie!
- You like that?

21:01.212 --> 21:03.113
See, I need more
of that on my team.

21:03.148 --> 21:04.648
You offering me a job?

21:04.682 --> 21:07.150
I don't have any immediate
vacancies, but I will.

21:07.185 --> 21:09.185
In six years' time, you and me,

21:09.220 --> 21:11.454
Oval Office ordering
a pizza and an air strike.

21:11.488 --> 21:13.823
Thin crust, extra warheads.

21:13.857 --> 21:17.026
Get the Rolling Stones to perform
in my fucking living room.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.227
( Both laugh )

21:18.261 --> 21:20.296
20/20, yo.

21:21.465 --> 21:24.099
( Phone ringing )

21:25.469 --> 21:28.870
<i>- Ma'am?
- Dan, your 15 minutes of furlough are over.</i>

21:28.905 --> 21:31.372
I need you back.
To the Bastardmobile.

21:31.407 --> 21:32.840
Yeah.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.811
You know, I didn't realize
how good I was at this job

21:37.845 --> 21:39.580
until someone else
did it so badly.

21:39.614 --> 21:41.748
- Different isn't bad.
- No, bad is bad.

21:41.782 --> 21:44.250
Okay, so what do we got
on the deck for today?

21:44.284 --> 21:45.651
We got that NASA meeting?

21:45.686 --> 21:47.186
No, it looks like the NASA
guys had to reschedule.

21:47.221 --> 21:49.455
Aw, crap.
I wanted to meet the NASA guys.

21:49.489 --> 21:51.224
Gary, they don't even walk
on the moon anymore.

21:51.258 --> 21:53.193
They're basically a bunch
of nerds who work in a hangar.

21:53.227 --> 21:54.961
So what do we got instead?

21:55.062 --> 21:57.364
You have a visit to the waste
management plant in Fairfax.

21:57.398 --> 22:00.934
Okay, I don't know what is the most
depressing word in that sentence.

22:00.968 --> 22:02.869
All you got to do is go
meet the garbage guys.

22:02.903 --> 22:05.505
You know, make it look like you're getting
your hands dirty with the common man.

22:05.540 --> 22:06.840
Get some pictures
for the press.

22:06.875 --> 22:08.909
A nice little puff piece.
I set it up.

22:08.944 --> 22:11.512
- You're furloughed, Mike.
- Without pay?

22:11.546 --> 22:14.315
Yeah, that's how it works.
Go sign the paperwork on Amy's desk.

22:14.349 --> 22:15.883
Try renting out
your fucking boat.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.585
Ma'am, look, I had
no choice in this.

22:17.619 --> 22:19.454
Gary's the one who promised
the garbage guy a visit.

22:19.488 --> 22:22.557
Gary wouldn't do something
that idiotic, would you, Gary?

22:22.592 --> 22:26.796
Well, under certain circumstances,
a garbage service...

22:26.830 --> 22:28.297
<i>Selina: Ah!</i>

22:28.331 --> 22:29.765
Yeah, no, no.
I get it.

22:29.799 --> 22:32.168
- I understand now.
- Yeah. Whew.

22:32.202 --> 22:33.569
- Hey, Gary.
- Yeah?

22:33.603 --> 22:34.804
- You're furloughed.
- No!

22:34.838 --> 22:35.971
I'm sorry.
I got Sue.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.606
( Sighs )
No.

22:37.641 --> 22:39.441
You got to sign
the paperwork on Amy's desk.

22:39.475 --> 22:41.743
- ( Knocks )
- Ma'am?

22:41.778 --> 22:45.380
Gary mentioned you might be able to
get my passport renewal fast-tracked.

22:45.414 --> 22:48.750
Okay, Gary, get out.
Go fuck yourself, Jonah.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.552
Ma'am, I'm G8 advance team.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.021
Go, period, fuck, period,

22:53.055 --> 22:54.823
yourself, exclamation point.

22:54.857 --> 22:56.558
But, ma'am, I helped
with the garbage.

22:57.727 --> 23:00.162
( Quietly )
Oh, you helped with the...

23:00.197 --> 23:01.864
with the garbage?

23:02.966 --> 23:04.867
Yeah, I helped
with the garbage.

23:06.070 --> 23:07.804
- Um, Sue.
- Yeah?

23:07.838 --> 23:09.339
Could you get in touch

23:09.373 --> 23:11.941
with what's-his-fuck
at the State Department?

23:11.976 --> 23:14.010
A doff of the cap
to you, my lady.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.511
- Amy: Ma'am.
- Yeah?

23:15.579 --> 23:18.448
Did you just furlough Gary and
Mike when I was in the bathroom?

23:18.483 --> 23:22.252
I did. So Sue's the new Gary
and you are still the Amy.

23:22.287 --> 23:23.387
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:23.421 --> 23:25.923
Hey, hey.
What have I missed?

23:25.957 --> 23:28.059
She is furloughing
indiscriminately into the crowd.

23:28.093 --> 23:30.595
Uh, Amy, a quick word.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.468
Please don't tell me
you got it on with the widow.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.972
Tell me honestly.
Where do you think Selina's heading?

23:41.006 --> 23:43.308
What's making you doubt her?

23:43.342 --> 23:45.978
Land deal shit, fake relationship
shit, shutdown shit.

23:46.012 --> 23:48.080
You left out that she just did
a deal with Roger Furlong

23:48.114 --> 23:50.783
and is becoming semidependent
on antidepressants.

23:50.850 --> 23:52.918
Oh, well, what could
possibly go wrong?

23:54.420 --> 23:55.787
<i>Selina:
Okay, Sue, let's go.</i>

23:55.822 --> 23:58.056
Ma'am, I am so sorry

23:58.090 --> 23:59.324
that I could not
get you the widow.

23:59.358 --> 24:01.793
Yeah, that was what I would
call a massive fuckup.

24:01.827 --> 24:03.995
- Yeah.
- Well, the newspapers are suggesting

24:04.029 --> 24:07.398
that I am responsible for the
grisly death of some idiot.

24:07.432 --> 24:09.233
But I'm on my way
to a garbage dump,

24:09.301 --> 24:11.168
so that's a positive, right?

24:11.203 --> 24:12.636
Well, that's a good
attitude to have.

24:12.671 --> 24:14.204
Amy, why is everybody else

24:14.239 --> 24:15.639
in charge of my image
except me?

24:15.673 --> 24:18.008
- We've got to do something, Amy.
- Okay.

24:18.042 --> 24:20.476
Ma'am, the dump has a contaminated
sludge delivery at 10:15,

24:20.511 --> 24:21.944
so we have
a very limited window.

24:21.979 --> 24:24.313
Okay, I just...
I just want to think...

24:24.347 --> 24:27.783
we just need to think with
our heads for a minute.

24:29.151 --> 24:30.385
Maybe get me on TV?

24:30.419 --> 24:32.121
Well, we don't want
to do "First Response"

24:32.155 --> 24:33.956
with Janet Ryland
or anything, but I mean...

24:33.990 --> 24:37.259
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

24:37.294 --> 24:39.195
Yeah, that's a great idea.

24:39.229 --> 24:40.430
That's precisely
what I want to do, Dan.

24:40.464 --> 24:42.365
- Good.
- Oh, okay, then, yes. Exactly.

24:42.399 --> 24:43.666
You know what?
The more I think about it,

24:43.701 --> 24:45.869
she actually might be
exactly what we want to do.

24:45.903 --> 24:48.304
She's respected,
but she's not dangerous.

24:48.339 --> 24:49.973
She's staid, she's stately.

24:50.007 --> 24:52.275
She's old and cold

24:52.310 --> 24:54.244
and I'm warm and...

24:54.278 --> 24:56.747
- Young?
- Young, exactly.

24:56.781 --> 24:58.448
And I'm a mother.

24:58.483 --> 24:59.950
So we should
round up Catherine,

24:59.984 --> 25:01.284
at gunpoint, if we have to.

25:01.319 --> 25:03.420
And maybe Andrew.

25:03.454 --> 25:05.021
Yeah?

25:05.056 --> 25:07.791
Honestly, all of America
will be watching.

25:07.825 --> 25:10.761
If it doesn't land, then this could
be the end to this whole adventure.

25:10.795 --> 25:12.229
( Laughs )
Come on. Come on.

25:12.263 --> 25:14.198
- Melodrama queen.
- Sue: Tick tock, tick tock.

25:14.232 --> 25:16.868
<i>- Sludge time.
- Yeah. This is gonna be a great idea.</i>

25:16.902 --> 25:19.637
So call "First Response,"
get this thing underway.

25:19.671 --> 25:21.239
We've got to unenfurlough
Mike and Gary.

25:21.273 --> 25:23.542
- Unfurlough.
- That's what I just said, Amy.

25:23.576 --> 25:27.046
Okay? So let's just throw as
many bodies at this as we can.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.614
That's what we're gonna do.

25:30.751 --> 25:33.420
You may want to wear this mask
in case the wind changes.

25:33.454 --> 25:34.855
Oh, really?
No, I don't think so.

25:34.889 --> 25:37.057
I think...
mm, yeah, okay.

25:37.091 --> 25:39.393
That's not a bad idea,
actually.

25:39.461 --> 25:40.828
It's great to meet you, Janine.

25:40.863 --> 25:43.665
Your bravery has been
an inspiration for us all.

25:43.699 --> 25:46.701
Now look, ma'am, I've allotted
exactly three minutes

25:46.769 --> 25:48.570
- for small talk, during which...
- Okay, thank you, Sue.

25:48.604 --> 25:50.205
Then after that,
there's a maximum

25:50.239 --> 25:51.940
- of 10 minutes for glass...
- That's enough, Sue.

25:51.975 --> 25:53.342
There are cameras.
There are cameras here.

25:53.376 --> 25:55.811
If there's anything I can do...

25:55.879 --> 25:58.447
It is so nice to hear
someone say that.

25:58.482 --> 26:00.917
<i>Chung: If you need
it, you got it.</i>

26:00.985 --> 26:03.152
God bless you.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.822
This wildlife in the area,

26:05.856 --> 26:08.525
I wonder how it's impacted
by this very facility.

26:08.559 --> 26:11.828
We get a lot of rats,
if that's what you mean.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.897
Oh, well, that makes sense, doesn't it?
Of course, yeah.

26:14.932 --> 26:17.266
And he served in the Coast
Guard, is that right?

26:17.300 --> 26:18.867
Yes, sir.

26:18.902 --> 26:21.636
It would have been a mighty
privilege to have known him.

26:21.671 --> 26:24.973
And I'm sure you know, Joe,

26:25.007 --> 26:28.410
that nationally
we spend about $71

26:28.444 --> 26:30.812
per ton of waste on recycling

26:30.846 --> 26:33.981
while we spend $86
per ton on collection.

26:34.016 --> 26:36.584
Do you find this
divergence troubling?

26:37.586 --> 26:39.087
Ma'am,
I-I just shovel it.

26:39.121 --> 26:42.390
- I don't account for it.
- Okay. ( Chuckles )

26:42.425 --> 26:44.693
This doesn't look
great, does it?

26:44.727 --> 26:46.994
Depends on which
channel you're watching.

26:47.029 --> 26:50.364
I think we can all learn from the
incredible strength you've shown.

26:50.399 --> 26:53.200
- Are you married, Joe?
- Yes.

26:53.268 --> 26:54.969
Ah, that's lovely.
