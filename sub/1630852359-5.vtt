[Money for Nothing
by Dire Straits]
â™ª MTV...

00:07.311 --> 00:09.009
[music]

00:09.052 --> 00:12.708
Elsa: I think cities have
weakened us, as a species.

00:14.231 --> 00:16.059
Mistakes have no
consequences there.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.107
Step into the road
without looking

00:20.150 --> 00:21.717
and the carriage merely
stops or swerves.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.851
The only consequence,
an angry driver.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.942
But here, there can
be no mistakes.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.773
Because here doesn't care.

00:38.342 --> 00:41.345
The river doesn't care
if you can swim.

00:41.389 --> 00:45.262
The snake doesn't care how
much you love your children,

00:45.306 --> 00:47.612
and the wolf has
no interest in your dreams.

00:49.701 --> 00:53.836
If you fail to beat
the current, you will drown.

00:53.879 --> 00:56.926
If you get too close,
you will be bitten.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.362
[crying]

00:58.406 --> 01:01.409
If you are too weak,
you will be eaten.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.978
[music]

01:06.022 --> 01:07.458
- Let's push 'em back.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.423
- We crossed the main
stem of the Brazos River,

01:15.466 --> 01:18.687
just north of the Clear Fork.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.516
Though maps say
we are still in Texas,

01:21.559 --> 01:23.605
the convergence
of the main stem

01:23.648 --> 01:26.303
and the Clear Fork
is where civilization ends.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.830
The land of no consequence
is behind us.

01:31.874 --> 01:33.789
We are in the land
of no mercy now.

01:34.398 --> 01:37.793
[music]

01:43.668 --> 01:46.280
- I saw good pasture
to the west.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.586
- We're gonna hide them
in a canyon up north.

01:49.239 --> 01:51.154
- Hide 'em?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.024
Hide 'em from who?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.987
- Bandits.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.336
[chuckles]

01:59.380 --> 02:01.033
- What kind of bandits?

02:01.077 --> 02:02.557
- Every kind.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.385
Sons of bitches out
here'll steal your bed roll

02:04.428 --> 02:05.386
with you in it.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.257
- Hey.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.739
Don't go nowhere alone, okay?

02:14.221 --> 02:15.352
Hey.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.050
I mean it.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.446
[music]

02:22.490 --> 02:24.448
[horse snorts]

02:29.497 --> 02:30.672
- I'm gonna hunt
some high ground.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.413
Have a look around.
Hold 'em here.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.371
[cow lows]

02:37.374 --> 02:40.943
[music]

02:40.986 --> 02:42.466
[cows lowing]

02:53.521 --> 02:55.218
- Goddammit.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.698
[sniffs]

03:04.532 --> 03:06.838
Thomas: The wagon
was their food wagon.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.013
Shea: The one that sunk?

03:10.668 --> 03:12.279
- Me and the farmer
saved what we could, but...

03:13.628 --> 03:16.108
They got no food, Captain.

03:16.152 --> 03:19.111
Need to resupply.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.723
- We'll cross at Doan's.
Resupply there.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.986
- Doan's is a week's ride.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.292
- Yep.

03:27.294 --> 03:30.775
- Goodnight's ranch
ain't crazy far.

03:30.819 --> 03:32.734
Neither is Burke Burnett's.

03:32.777 --> 03:35.040
- That country's too rough.

03:35.084 --> 03:36.303
And the wrong direction...

03:45.225 --> 03:47.662
- Missing 'em bad
this morning, huh?

03:47.705 --> 03:49.664
- I miss 'em bad
every morning, Tom.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.103
That ain't what's
eating at me today.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.366
- What's eating you, then?

03:58.281 --> 04:01.719
- We're making too many widows.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.504
Too many orphans.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.201
- We ain't making nuthin'.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.161
Their deaths ain't our fault.

04:09.205 --> 04:12.600
- They're our responsibility.
That makes 'em our fault.

04:12.643 --> 04:16.473
- How's this different than
sending soldiers over a hill?

04:16.517 --> 04:18.345
You knew they was gonna die.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.042
You never shed
a tear for them.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.001
- The hell I didn't.

04:30.661 --> 04:34.317
[music]

05:37.554 --> 05:39.034
- Breakfast is ready.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.036
John: I'm getting dressed.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.212
- Well, get dressed faster.

05:43.255 --> 05:47.129
John: I ain't got much practice
of doing this by myself.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.179
- What the hell are those?

05:54.223 --> 05:55.703
- They grow on the cactus.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.663
- How do you know
they're not poisonous?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.273
- 'Cause I ate one yesterday.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.102
Try it.

06:06.148 --> 06:07.062
I'm gonna make
a jelly out of it.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.412
- Mm.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.808
- I got dressed
all by myself, mama.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.159
- I can see that.
- [James chuckles]

06:19.596 --> 06:21.859
Here you go, son.

06:26.516 --> 06:29.084
- Our daughter gonna join
us for breakfast today?

06:29.127 --> 06:30.128
- She's with the herd.

06:31.782 --> 06:32.914
- She's been with
the herd for almost a week.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.875
- It's making
a good cowboy out of her.

06:41.662 --> 06:42.750
- I didn't know
that was the goal.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.116
- Where are you going?

07:01.159 --> 07:03.074
- I don't recall the part
of our vows that said

07:03.118 --> 07:05.120
I need to ask your permission
to go somewhere.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.211
[clicks tongue]

07:14.346 --> 07:15.957
[German & Slavic chatter]

07:20.135 --> 07:21.919
- We leaving today?

07:21.963 --> 07:23.878
- It's only gonna get hotter.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.706
If we sit around
here like it's Sunday,

07:25.749 --> 07:27.577
those folks are gonna
just cook up

07:27.621 --> 07:29.710
whatever food they got left.

07:29.753 --> 07:30.667
We got to keep 'em moving.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.454
- We must speak.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.547
- All right. Speak.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.897
- We ride to one river
and we don't cross

07:42.940 --> 07:44.725
then we ride a week
to a worse river.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.640
We are forced
to leave everything behind

07:46.683 --> 07:47.684
and still we're dying.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.688
- You are the leader.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.516
- You fight amongst yourselves.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.648
Steal from each other.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.042
You don't do what we say

07:58.086 --> 07:59.653
and you do what we
tell you don't do.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.137
- As far as river crossings go,

08:06.181 --> 08:07.443
that's as easy
as it's gonna get.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.185
When I say
"don't stop in the middle"

08:10.228 --> 08:12.535
by God, you'd better
not stop.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.930
We're here to show you
the way, to protect you.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.758
We ain't your people's leader.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.674
That's your job,
you just ain't doing it.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.806
But you better start
because most of your food

08:22.850 --> 08:24.504
is in the bottom of that river

08:24.547 --> 08:27.028
because you decided to put it
all in one fuckin' wagon.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.769
- We had no choice.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.292
We...

08:30.335 --> 08:33.295
Mein English...

08:33.338 --> 08:35.863
We are not all friends.
We are not all family.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.604
We came on the same ship
and that is all.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.868
Some take from others
whatever they want.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.260
Whatever they need.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567
We... we put the food together.
To protect it.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.658
- Who's stealing?

08:51.922 --> 08:54.490
- There's only 43 of you
and you don't know?

08:56.579 --> 08:57.885
- I know.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.756
- Show me.

09:01.758 --> 09:02.672
- [sigh]

09:10.419 --> 09:11.812
- Set it right there, son.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.649
- We should get moving.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.694
- We need to take care
of something first.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.653
Come with us.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.089
[music]

09:32.136 --> 09:34.661
- John, you get in the wagon
and you stay there.

09:34.704 --> 09:35.879
Don't come out.
You hear me?

09:38.926 --> 09:42.146
[music]

09:44.671 --> 09:47.021
[German & Slavic chatter]

10:00.600 --> 10:02.427
- You must give it back.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.777
- Give what back?

10:03.820 --> 10:06.257
- We lost our food in the river.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.303
You must give back
what you took.

10:08.346 --> 10:11.088
- Because you lose your food
I must give you mine?

10:12.786 --> 10:15.136
- Your food was our food
before you took it.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.660
- From who did I take?
Huh?

10:19.749 --> 10:21.272
From who did I take?

10:21.316 --> 10:22.665
- From me.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.277
[German & Slavic chatter]

10:26.321 --> 10:28.018
- We traded.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.804
I push your wagon,
and you give food.

10:30.847 --> 10:34.155
- You offered to help
then you took the food.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.460
- What are you doing?

10:38.115 --> 10:41.292
[speaking German & Slavic]

10:41.336 --> 10:42.685
- Let them
work it out together.

10:47.037 --> 10:48.648
[German & Slavic chatter]

10:52.086 --> 10:55.045
- You don't go in mein wagon.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.744
- We have nothing
because of you.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.141

[gunshot]

11:16.371 --> 11:17.415
[grunts]

11:29.471 --> 11:31.516
- Gonna eat all
that yourself, big boy?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.083
Heh?

11:33.127 --> 11:35.695
[German & Slavic chatter]

11:41.265 --> 11:43.703
- There any more?

11:48.011 --> 11:48.969
- That one.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.062
- I did nothing.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.846
- Take me to your wagon
and prove it.

11:58.892 --> 12:02.852
[music]

12:06.551 --> 12:07.857
- What is this?

12:07.901 --> 12:08.902
- A refund.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.774
Find your own way to Oregon.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.167
You follow us and I'll kill you.

12:18.476 --> 12:19.521
Same goes for you.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.790
The only way you survive this
is working together.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.489
Leaning on each other.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.623
This trip ain't even got
hard yet, but hard's coming.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.497
The river is what happens
when you don't work together.

12:42.718 --> 12:43.980
That is your leader.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.636
You chose him.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.159
Now follow him.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.813
Or choose
someone you will follow.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.861
Break your camps
and hitch your teams.

12:54.904 --> 12:55.949
We're leaving in an hour.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.389
I mean it.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.999
To follow us will be
the death of you.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.829
[music]

13:10.877 --> 13:12.400
[German & Slavic chatter]

13:16.317 --> 13:17.884
[horse snorts]

13:21.191 --> 13:23.803
[music]

14:25.473 --> 14:27.562
[kisses]

14:35.831 --> 14:36.919
- You smell like a goat.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.228
- I was gonna bathe in the river

14:41.271 --> 14:43.926
but Ennis said
this is bandit country

14:43.970 --> 14:45.449
and not to go anywhere alone.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.106
- Sounds like Ennis is
hinting at a bath with you.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.371
- He didn't suggest a bath.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.895
- If he'd gotten this close
to you he would've.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.855
[music]

15:04.686 --> 15:06.079
- I kissed him, mama.

15:15.610 --> 15:16.872
You mad?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.134
- I suppose I should be.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.183
But I kissed a few boys
when I was your age too,

15:23.226 --> 15:24.924
and the world
didn't end.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.102
Just don't let it go
beyond kissing.

15:31.191 --> 15:33.584
- Why, what's beyond kissing?

15:35.108 --> 15:36.718
- You've seen enough
farm animals

15:36.761 --> 15:38.372
to know how babies
are made, Elsa.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.156
- I know how they're made.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.813
Haven't fully figured how
it translates to people.

15:46.684 --> 15:47.947
- Mm.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.080
You spend enough time
with that cowboy

15:51.124 --> 15:54.040
I'm pretty sure you're going
to find out quick enough.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.478
I recommend you don't though.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.003
I recommend you save it
for someone you love.

16:05.747 --> 16:06.835
- Maybe I love him.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.579
I get butterflies
when he looks at me.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.061
I get butterflies
when he don't.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.412
- That's not love, honey.
That's...

16:23.199 --> 16:24.200
Dammit.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.771
I guess we're gonna have to have
that conversation, aren't we?

16:33.340 --> 16:35.995
Well, I say we kill two birds
with one stone.

16:37.039 --> 16:37.997
Come on.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.859
I envy you.

17:14.903 --> 17:15.947
Becoming a woman out here.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.565
No rules or worries

17:24.608 --> 17:26.915
or whispers about
what you should do.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.400
There's no such thing
as freedom, Elsa.

17:33.443 --> 17:34.749
Don't let anyone tell
you there is.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.840
There's laws, there's rules

17:38.883 --> 17:41.712
there's customs,
responsibilities everywhere.

17:41.756 --> 17:45.281
The more people
you cram together

17:45.325 --> 17:46.413
the more rules
there'll be.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.028
I don't know what life
is like in Oregon,

17:55.161 --> 17:56.510
but there'll be rules there too.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.297
[sighs]

18:04.474 --> 18:08.261
This trail is as
free as you'll ever be.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.701
The only rules
you need to follow...

18:17.661 --> 18:19.315
are the ones in your heart.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.848
- We gonna talk about sex now?

18:34.896 --> 18:36.115
- We just did.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.684
[laughs]

18:40.728 --> 18:42.164
[hooves approaching]

18:50.955 --> 18:51.956
- Oh.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.829
I-I-I'm sorry, I was, uh...

18:56.091 --> 18:58.963
We, I had to...
We, uh...

18:59.007 --> 19:00.617
- Put your tongue
in your mouth, son.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.837
It helps you speak better.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.795
- Ye-Yes, ma'am.

19:04.839 --> 19:08.190
The, uh...
The wagons are moving.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.324
- I thought we were
leaving tomorrow.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.281
- Leaving now, ma'am.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.328
- All right.

19:18.809 --> 19:19.941
We'll get dressed.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.335
- Yes, ma'am.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.294
- Once you leave.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.169
- Yes ma'am. Sorry.
I'm leaving.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.349
[laughing]

19:39.874 --> 19:42.398
- I envy you, honey.
I really do.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.362
- Hup, hup.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.411
- You helping with
the herd, Mrs. Dutton?

19:56.804 --> 19:57.848
- I should go check on my son.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.505
- If you see Thomas,
could you send for him?

20:03.854 --> 20:05.639
- Everything alright?

20:05.682 --> 20:08.119
- Everything's fine, ma'am.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.947
If you can spare your husband,
would you send him as well?

20:10.731 --> 20:12.472
[music]

20:12.515 --> 20:14.213
- [sighs]
I'll send them both.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.828
[gallops away]

20:23.613 --> 20:26.703
- We're gonna push these cattle
right behind the wagons.

20:26.747 --> 20:27.748
Keep 'em close.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.290
- Is this America?

20:50.901 --> 20:53.513
Where is this...
Where is this freedom?

20:56.472 --> 20:58.866
Where is this justice?

21:02.086 --> 21:04.263
You are sheep
with no shepherd.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.357
You follow the wolves.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.665
You follow the wolves!

21:23.891 --> 21:26.285
- I'm a man of my word.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.721
If you ever see my face again,

21:27.764 --> 21:29.549
it'll be the last
thing you see.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.944
[music]

21:42.431 --> 21:45.478
Elsa: In less than three weeks,
we had shrunk by half.

21:45.521 --> 21:49.525
Eight men, six women,
and four children had died.

21:49.569 --> 21:52.572
And now we leave
at least that many behind...

21:52.615 --> 21:57.272
If strength is in numbers,
then we are growing weaker.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.274
When we need our strength
the most.

[music]

22:12.722 --> 22:14.724

22:14.768 --> 22:16.639
No shoes.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.033
- We're a ways
from the reservation.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.687
- Maybe just hunting.

22:20.730 --> 22:24.299
- Naw,they ain't travel
this far to hunt.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.996
They know we're going
water to water.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.307
Keep everything
close tonight.

22:46.539 --> 22:50.369
[German & Slavic chatter]

22:50.412 --> 22:51.935
- They look like
they're starving already.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.418
- In this heat,
walking this rough trail,

22:56.462 --> 22:57.941
it don't take long to starve.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.772
- It'll hit them kids first.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.079
- We should chip our
rations in with theirs.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.254
- Already did.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.170
- How about you?

23:11.477 --> 23:13.392
- That ain't part
of our bargain.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.828
- You gonna watch them starve?

23:16.482 --> 23:18.919
- There's fifty head
of cattle right there.

23:18.962 --> 23:21.400
Ain't nobody got to starve.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.227
- When we leave Kansas,

23:23.271 --> 23:25.360
there ain't no trading
posts 'till Wyoming.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.362
That's a month.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.669
We need to save the cattle.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.627
- I won't risk
my family for theirs.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.415
- You will chip in with us
or you will go your own way.

23:39.374 --> 23:41.463
- My wagon wheels
don't strip so easy, Captain.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.815
You need a cook
with his own wagon

23:45.859 --> 23:47.469
and the skill to drive it,
otherwise...

23:47.513 --> 23:51.342
you're going to end up
in the same situation next week.

23:51.386 --> 23:56.043
You want my rations,
that's my price.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.741
- I'll hire the first one I see
when we get to Doan's,

23:58.785 --> 23:59.786
you have my word.

24:01.744 --> 24:02.745

24:34.777 --> 24:36.518
- Bandits.

24:36.562 --> 24:37.563
- Could be.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.827
I want you to sleep
with the wagons tonight.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.790
Cattle and horses ain't the only
thing they steal out here.

24:48.965 --> 24:49.836
You understand me?

24:52.012 --> 24:52.969
- Yessir.

attraction.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.102
It consumes you.

26:24.060 --> 26:26.497
Stronger than hunger

26:26.541 --> 26:29.718
or fear or anything
I've ever felt.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.896
I feel it everywhere.

You done this before?

- Sort of?

- Yeah.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.411
Uh... In Dodge City.

27:57.371 --> 28:01.288
I paid a woman
to show me, but...

28:02.376 --> 28:03.377
It didn't work.

28:10.210 --> 28:14.736
I didn't like her,
my body, it wouldn't...

She couldn't make me feel like
this no matter what I paid her.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.837
But I... I know what to do...

28:28.881 --> 28:29.882
If you want me to do it.

- Morning.

- You'd better be careful.

- Careful with what?

33:08.290 --> 33:09.465
- You're a woman now,
ain't you?

33:11.946 --> 33:13.382
And woman to woman--
you'd better be careful.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.300
It takes years to make
something of your life.

33:20.389 --> 33:22.304
One decision can change
the course of it forever.

us until we make it.

We're so past "ma'am".

If you have a child
you'll raise it.

I will not do it for you.

Having a hard enough
time raising my own,

34:05.913 --> 34:07.480
as you can clearly see.

34:18.621 --> 34:19.405
And if you decide
to do it again...

34:22.843 --> 34:25.237
Do it outside of earshot
of the damn camp.

34:28.718 --> 34:30.111
- Does daddy know?

watching the herd.

- Will he raise it with you?

- I suggest you do that.

It was beautiful.

One day you'll see
it through mine, though.

[music]

36:07.861 --> 36:09.210

Freedom is
accepting consequences.

Wrapping them
around you like a blanket.

I'll choose to love that too.

enough to help raise it?

- That we're getting married.

all figured out, don't you?

any figuring that one out.

is her father and quick.

is gonna kill you.

- Six of them, you think?

38:38.185 --> 38:39.534
- Six horses anyway.

38:42.407 --> 38:43.321
- We need more guns.

- I'll take four good fighters

any day.

or are they just for show?

but by God I know how.

and figure this out.

what that word means.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.257
I went to him.

I know what that word means,
and I love him.

- Will you?

40:22.898 --> 40:23.899
That's how you ask?

- I ain't asking nothing.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.427
If she loves me...

40:32.212 --> 40:33.300
I'm taking it.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.172
If you won't give her to me,

40:36.216 --> 40:39.262
I'll goddam steal her,
I swear it.

40:48.054 --> 40:49.708
- You got it all figured out,
don't you?

41:02.242 --> 41:03.504
You say you love her...

41:04.810 --> 41:06.246
but you won't
ever love her like I do.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.424
That's my heart
you're running off with.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.949
You'd better
cradle it like an egg.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.998
- I will, sir.

41:22.828 --> 41:24.177
I will.

41:27.354 --> 41:28.355
- A little warning.

41:30.444 --> 41:31.967
That girl is gonna
run you ragged.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.971
- It's already got
that look to it, sir.

41:39.105 --> 41:41.847
- Mount up.
Let's get back to camp.

[music]

42:38.556 --> 42:40.470
[German & Slavic chatter]

42:44.692 --> 42:45.693
- I love you.

42:47.260 --> 42:48.304
- I love you.

42:50.916 --> 42:54.049
What if they come
back around for us instead?

42:54.093 --> 42:56.008
- They won't.

42:56.051 --> 42:57.226
- But what if they do, James?

42:58.663 --> 43:00.273
- Then you fight
like a damn panther

43:00.316 --> 43:01.361
until I get back to you.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.455
- Let's get her moving.

43:11.501 --> 43:13.503
[German & Slavic chatter]

43:45.971 --> 43:48.713
[ominous music]

43:59.071 --> 43:59.637
[grunts]

44:28.883 --> 44:30.842
- She'll be worth something.

44:34.367 --> 44:36.499
Lots of feathers
to pluck off that chicken.

44:39.764 --> 44:42.854
[music]

44:59.522 --> 45:01.307
- We wait for dark?

45:01.350 --> 45:03.048
- What for?

45:03.091 --> 45:04.223
It's just one wagon.

45:47.222 --> 45:48.876
[panting]

45:50.095 --> 45:52.401
[music]

46:18.993 --> 46:20.212
Man: Smells good.

46:41.407 --> 46:42.234
- Where is your horse?

46:43.496 --> 46:45.106
- I was hopin' you'd know.

46:45.150 --> 46:46.716
Damn bugger bucked me off.

46:49.023 --> 46:50.111
You out here alone?

46:51.852 --> 46:52.810
- With my husband.

46:55.725 --> 46:56.726
- Don't see no husband.

47:00.992 --> 47:03.168
- He went for water.

47:03.211 --> 47:04.822
- Well, he's gonna be gone
a while then.

47:06.214 --> 47:07.433
Ain't much water around here.

47:11.959 --> 47:12.917
Whatcha cookin'?

47:14.483 --> 47:16.050
- Stew.

47:18.705 --> 47:19.924
- That a fact?

47:22.840 --> 47:23.841
Ah, come on.

47:25.364 --> 47:26.844
You fucking bitch!

47:35.635 --> 47:36.984
[screams]

47:41.293 --> 47:41.771
[gunfire]

47:41.815 --> 47:43.686
Run! Run!

48:13.151 --> 48:15.718
Liza!
Liza!

48:15.762 --> 48:17.242
[crying]

48:20.985 --> 48:22.203
- What is this place?

48:23.988 --> 48:26.860
Where are you taking me?

48:26.904 --> 48:28.427

48:33.388 --> 48:35.303
- Shoot 'em!
Shoot 'em!

48:41.919 --> 48:43.877
[gunfire]

48:52.799 --> 48:54.409
Keep shooting, keep firing!

49:01.939 --> 49:04.289
[distant gunfire]

49:04.332 --> 49:07.292
[German & Slavic screams]

49:08.641 --> 49:12.993
[music]

49:18.477 --> 49:20.131
- You got that pistol with you?

49:20.174 --> 49:21.610
- In my saddle bags.

49:21.654 --> 49:22.611
- Get it out.

49:33.971 --> 49:37.539
[music]

49:57.777 --> 49:58.734
[horse whinnies]

50:39.123 --> 50:40.863
I loved her.

50:44.171 --> 50:45.390
- I don't doubt it, son.

50:48.001 --> 50:53.267

51:57.026 --> 51:59.681

51:59.725 --> 52:04.469
- No! No! No!

52:04.512 --> 52:07.602
[sobbing]

52:08.647 --> 52:10.344
Please...

52:10.388 --> 52:11.911
No! No, no, no.

52:14.740 --> 52:16.481
[sobbing]

52:54.171 --> 52:56.651
- I'd known death
since I was a child.

52:57.696 --> 52:58.914
It's everywhere.

53:00.786 --> 53:02.353
But it had never touched me.

53:04.355 --> 53:07.445
It had never placed
its rotten finger on my heart.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.013
Until today.

53:12.711 --> 53:14.539
Today, my eyes died.

53:16.454 --> 53:18.717
I see the world
through my mother's eyes now.

53:21.676 --> 53:25.202
Yes, freedom has fangs.

53:26.681 --> 53:28.335
And it sunk them in me.

53:33.297 --> 53:36.125
I chose to love him.

53:36.169 --> 53:37.736
He chose to love me back.

53:39.868 --> 53:41.653
Then chose to protect me..

53:45.526 --> 53:48.007
Then a man we've never
met chose to kill him...

53:52.881 --> 53:54.013
and made me color blind.

54:03.196 --> 54:07.069
[music]

54:09.115 --> 54:12.597
Maybe killing this man
will get my eyes back.

54:12.640 --> 54:13.685
Maybe it won't.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.470
But I chose to find out.

54:19.256 --> 54:21.258
