00:14.618 --> 00:15.617
I have one minute.

00:15.619 --> 00:18.120
Whoop, there we go.

00:18.122 --> 00:19.821
Get your mama. Get her.

00:19.823 --> 00:21.272
Ohh!

00:21.274 --> 00:23.041
Denied.

00:24.610 --> 00:27.879
Mommy, wake up.
It's time to play.

00:27.881 --> 00:29.948
Oh, Henry.

00:29.950 --> 00:31.449
I'm late for work
and you promised.

00:31.451 --> 00:33.802
Ok, buddy, go get
your shoes. Go on.

00:33.804 --> 00:34.886
Yay!

00:36.289 --> 00:39.891
When will a day off ever
actually be a day off?

00:39.893 --> 00:41.292
In about 14 years.

00:41.294 --> 00:43.645
Come on.

00:50.136 --> 00:53.972
Oh, uh, so, remember, we have
the play date with Cameron.

00:53.974 --> 00:56.158
So...you're on your own
for dinner.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.492
Oh, I'll manage somehow.

00:57.494 --> 00:58.810
Mm.

00:58.812 --> 01:00.328
I love you, too.
I love you.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.530
I love you three.

01:01.532 --> 01:02.747
Jump!
Come on.

01:02.749 --> 01:05.083
Ohh! I love you four.

01:05.084 --> 01:07.119
You have to go
to your mama, ok?

01:07.121 --> 01:08.036
Ok.

01:08.038 --> 01:09.588
Yeah!
Are you ready to play soccer?

01:09.590 --> 01:11.673
Let's play soccer.
Ready?

01:11.675 --> 01:13.458
All right, kick it to mommy.

01:13.460 --> 01:14.443
Kick it.

01:14.445 --> 01:16.928
Whoa! Score!

01:16.930 --> 01:18.263
Say, bye, daddy!

01:18.265 --> 01:19.431
Bye, daddy.

01:19.433 --> 01:22.017
All right.
Kick it again.

01:29.775 --> 01:30.775
Good morning.

01:30.777 --> 01:32.144
Breakfast is served.

01:32.146 --> 01:33.145
Thank you.

01:33.147 --> 01:34.279
Mm. Am I early?

01:34.281 --> 01:35.780
No, no, no.
We're running late.

01:35.782 --> 01:36.948
We're just having
too good of a time.

01:36.950 --> 01:37.949
Hey!
Beth!

01:37.951 --> 01:39.651
Come and look
at our fort.

01:39.653 --> 01:41.153
Wow! You guys!

01:41.155 --> 01:43.655
This is inspired.

01:43.657 --> 01:45.123
Where's your cape?

01:45.125 --> 01:46.825
I'm wearing it.

01:48.545 --> 01:50.462
Yeah!
Come and see inside.

01:50.464 --> 01:51.913
Wow. Ohh!

01:51.915 --> 01:53.465
We slept in here
all night.

01:53.467 --> 01:56.718
It sounds so much fun.
I'm jealous.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.970
We're going to do it
again tonight, right, Dad?

01:58.972 --> 02:00.839
Sure, buddy.
No problem.

02:00.841 --> 02:03.775
Could Beth sleep over?

02:04.778 --> 02:06.228
Could she?

02:07.598 --> 02:09.814
I...

02:11.068 --> 02:13.902
I want to see it.
It's so cool.

02:13.904 --> 02:17.072
Ok, ok, uh, the TV movie
is in hall H at 9:00.

02:17.074 --> 02:19.224
- Can we go to that?
- Absolutely.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.676
You think we can we make it to the
Captains of the Enterprise panel at 11:00?

02:21.678 --> 02:23.228
Obs. Thanks for
coming with me.

02:23.230 --> 02:25.947
Of course. I've been
knitting this scarf for weeks.

02:25.949 --> 02:27.449
Penelope.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.167
Kevin. Hi.

02:29.169 --> 02:30.401
You came.

02:30.403 --> 02:31.836
And you brought a friend.

02:31.838 --> 02:34.206
CSU Technician Sharp,
how are you?

02:34.208 --> 02:35.507
Fine. You?

02:35.509 --> 02:36.791
I am also fine.

02:36.793 --> 02:38.627
Ok, well, see ya.

02:38.629 --> 02:40.011
You're not gonna go in?

02:40.013 --> 02:42.464
No. Actually, we just went in
and it's super lame,

02:42.466 --> 02:43.798
so we're leaving.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.383
Oh, ok.

02:45.385 --> 02:47.352
Oh, great costume.

02:47.354 --> 02:48.553
Yeah, you, too.

02:48.555 --> 02:49.521
That was awkward.

02:49.523 --> 02:51.106
Oh, my God.
We used to come every year.

02:51.108 --> 02:52.607
I can't believe
he brought someone else.

02:52.609 --> 02:54.259
Well, you brought
someone else.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.362
Yeah. Someone I couldn't possibly
be sexually attracted to.

02:57.364 --> 02:59.981
You're welcome?

02:59.983 --> 03:01.650
Whoa, Rossi!

03:03.619 --> 03:05.603
Why doesn't this
surprise me?

03:05.605 --> 03:07.105
Are you here
for the convention?

03:07.107 --> 03:10.275
Who schedules a cigar
aficionado event

03:10.277 --> 03:13.628
back to back with...
This?

03:13.630 --> 03:15.497
I know, right?
It's the greatest party ever.

03:15.499 --> 03:17.215
Well, it was gonna be.

03:17.217 --> 03:19.450
Unless it involves
gentleman Jack

03:19.452 --> 03:21.253
and pre-embargo
Cuban cigars,

03:21.255 --> 03:24.306
I find that statement
to be highly dubious.

03:24.308 --> 03:25.590
Kevin brought another woman.

03:25.592 --> 03:27.475
I'm plotting revenge.
Do you want to help?

03:28.961 --> 03:30.461
No.

03:30.463 --> 03:32.297
Now, you know
I love you both,

03:32.299 --> 03:35.267
but this is Saturday
and it is my day off,

03:35.269 --> 03:37.802
so I'd prefer
to love you from afar.

03:37.804 --> 03:40.355
So, have fun.

03:40.357 --> 03:41.990
It's my bedtime.

03:41.992 --> 03:43.275
It's 9 a.m.

03:43.277 --> 03:44.976
You're judging <i>me?</i>

04:06.432 --> 04:07.766
Thank you.

04:07.768 --> 04:09.351
Thanks.

04:11.304 --> 04:13.388
I don't know.

04:13.390 --> 04:15.106
Emily,
what's not to know?

04:15.108 --> 04:16.558
It's a beautiful place.

04:16.560 --> 04:20.111
There are cracks
in the foundation.

04:20.113 --> 04:22.113
Cracks can be fixed.

04:22.115 --> 04:24.733
No, they can
only be hidden.

04:24.735 --> 04:26.201
They're still there.

04:26.203 --> 04:28.987
What, are you afraid
the place is gonna fall down?

04:28.989 --> 04:31.740
I'm afraid it's never gonna be
as strong as it was.

04:31.742 --> 04:35.243
Ok, somebody's heart
is not into it.

04:35.245 --> 04:36.461
What's going on?

04:36.463 --> 04:38.630
I don't know.

04:38.632 --> 04:40.131
When I first came here,

04:40.133 --> 04:43.134
I felt like I was home.

04:43.136 --> 04:47.906
And now, it's just
an uphill battle.

04:50.810 --> 04:53.645
People kill for
opportunities like this.

04:53.647 --> 04:55.930
Am I crazy
to walk away?

04:55.932 --> 04:58.316
Well, you gotta do
what's best for you.

04:58.318 --> 04:59.934
Follow your gut.

04:59.936 --> 05:01.970
What's it trying
to tell you?

05:48.117 --> 05:49.784
Thank you.

05:59.112 --> 06:00.995
It's ok, ma'am.
Go ahead.

06:00.997 --> 06:02.964
Did you remember
to bring your key?

06:02.966 --> 06:04.549
Yes.

06:04.551 --> 06:06.751
Did you remember
your glasses?

06:06.753 --> 06:09.387
Yes. Nag, nag, nag.

06:11.842 --> 06:13.892
Over here, sir.

06:15.177 --> 06:16.895
I'm gonna need
to see your bag.

06:16.897 --> 06:18.430
Ok, sure.

06:21.268 --> 06:22.600
Over here, sir.

06:22.602 --> 06:24.936
It looks like everyone's setting
that thing off today.

06:24.938 --> 06:26.404
Sir, over here.

06:28.691 --> 06:30.475
Hey!

06:31.862 --> 06:33.644
Oh, God.

06:33.646 --> 06:35.146
I want to see hands
in the sky!

06:35.148 --> 06:36.948
Now!

06:36.950 --> 06:39.951
Try to trigger any alarm
or give me any damn dye packs

06:39.953 --> 06:41.986
and you're dead. You understand?
Do you understand?!

06:41.988 --> 06:44.005
Yes!

06:44.007 --> 06:46.674
Cash in here.

06:46.676 --> 06:48.209
Cash in here.

06:48.211 --> 06:49.660
Go, buddy.

06:49.662 --> 06:51.713
Come on!

06:51.715 --> 06:52.830
Time!

06:52.832 --> 06:55.266
1:45. Yes,
ladies and gentlemen,

06:55.268 --> 06:57.802
were the Face Cards.
Maybe you've heard of us.

07:02.225 --> 07:04.726
Get your faces
on the floor already.

07:04.728 --> 07:07.695
I see eyes,
you see bullets. Get it?

07:07.697 --> 07:09.731
Get down on the ground!

07:09.733 --> 07:11.616
Get down on the ground!

07:11.618 --> 07:12.867
1:30.

07:14.069 --> 07:15.570
What the hell is that?!

07:15.572 --> 07:18.356
I said no dye packs.

07:18.358 --> 07:19.857
What the hell is this?

07:19.859 --> 07:21.326
I'm sorry.

07:21.328 --> 07:23.044
Oh, she's sorry.
Sorry?

07:23.046 --> 07:24.045
Ohh!

07:24.047 --> 07:25.463
You're gonna be sorry.

07:25.465 --> 07:27.549
Please. We'll cooperate.

07:27.551 --> 07:29.167
Just tell me what you need.

07:29.169 --> 07:31.469
What I need?

07:31.471 --> 07:34.055
Well...

07:34.890 --> 07:36.374
Lynne...

07:36.376 --> 07:39.811
This is a bank,
right?

07:41.397 --> 07:44.265
What do you think
I need?

07:45.652 --> 07:49.938
Oh. Take me to
the vault, sweetie pie.

07:49.940 --> 07:52.173
Go. Go!

07:56.996 --> 07:58.563
One minute.

08:03.402 --> 08:05.537
All units in the vicinity
off Penn and Southeast,

08:05.539 --> 08:07.789
robbery in progress
at Colonial Liberty Bank.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.374
That's one block over.

08:09.376 --> 08:12.910
Shot fired. Repeat, shots fired at the
Colonial Liberty Bank. All units.

08:12.912 --> 08:15.964
426 responding.

08:23.689 --> 08:25.356
30 seconds, boss.

08:25.358 --> 08:26.641
All right, coming.

08:26.643 --> 08:28.926
On the ground
with the others.

08:30.613 --> 08:32.480
What do you mean?
We got trouble!

08:32.482 --> 08:33.648
Black-and-white.

08:33.650 --> 08:35.650
Get down. Down! Down!

08:35.652 --> 08:37.284
Side door. Let's go!

08:38.871 --> 08:40.905
Faces on the ground.

08:40.907 --> 08:45.443
Count to 100.
Don't even think of moving.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.679
I said count!

09:00.125 --> 09:02.810
Better pull back
and see if they respond.

09:08.350 --> 09:10.551
10-13. Officer down.

09:10.553 --> 09:13.087
Shots fired.
Repeat, shots fired.

Yeah.

It's definitely them.

10:35.943 --> 10:37.609
The media's calling them

10:37.611 --> 10:39.111
7 bank robberies
in 7 months.

10:39.113 --> 10:41.330
They've killed one person
at each robbery.

10:41.332 --> 10:42.581
M.O.?

10:42.583 --> 10:45.200
Single gunshot wound.
Each of the victims has bled out.

10:45.202 --> 10:47.953
Serial killers with

and we're only just
hearing about this now?

10:49.573 --> 10:51.256
Well, headquarters has
always characterized them

10:51.258 --> 10:53.125
robbers first
and killers second.

10:53.127 --> 10:56.261
No one kills 7 people without serious
psychopathic tendencies.

10:56.263 --> 10:58.180
I disagreed with the original assessment.
I was overruled.

10:58.182 --> 10:59.631
So why are we here now?

10:59.633 --> 11:01.416
Because crisis negotiation
is overseas.

11:01.418 --> 11:03.102
What more do we know
about them?

11:03.104 --> 11:06.254
They're organized, they're efficient.
Each strike lasts about 2 minutes.

11:06.256 --> 11:08.891
They gotta be scouting
the banks in advance.

11:08.893 --> 11:11.426
Why haven't we been able to I.D.
them off of surveillance footage?

11:11.428 --> 11:13.145
They hack the security feed
and turn off the cameras,

11:13.147 --> 11:16.365
both during the initial canvass
and during the robbery,

11:16.367 --> 11:19.067
until the masks come back on,
and then we're allowed to watch.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.987
I can't find anything.
No doors, no grates, nothing.

11:21.989 --> 11:25.874
Yo! Lynne! What's
another way out of here?

11:25.876 --> 11:28.076
Just the main entrance
and the side door. It's for security.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.662
I know that.
You think I'm stupid?

11:30.664 --> 11:32.965
What went wrong?
We were on count.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.133
I need a doctor.

11:34.135 --> 11:35.784
Is anyone a doctor?!

11:37.120 --> 11:38.453
Would you shut
that kid up!

11:38.455 --> 11:39.955
He's a baby. What do you
expect her to do?

11:39.957 --> 11:41.140
It's ok, baby.
It's ok.

11:41.142 --> 11:44.292
No one asked
for your opinion.

11:46.429 --> 11:49.481
It's not just the cops. We've got
the Feds now, too. We're screwed.

11:49.483 --> 11:51.016
You have to apply pressure.

11:51.018 --> 11:52.467
I can't even feel it.

11:52.469 --> 11:53.936
Yeah, I know. Just push down
as hard as you can.

11:53.938 --> 11:56.188
Would you focus
on what's important.

11:56.190 --> 11:58.774
Shut the hell up!
He's bleeding out.

11:58.776 --> 12:00.242
It's his fault
we're in this mess.

12:00.244 --> 12:02.110
Nice heads-up
on the cops, Olly.

12:02.112 --> 12:04.813
Maybe think it was your count
that was off, huh?

12:04.815 --> 12:06.448
How bad is it?

12:06.450 --> 12:08.333
You're gonna be fine.

12:08.335 --> 12:10.485
I don't want to die.

12:10.487 --> 12:13.822
We're all gonna die if we don't
get out of here. You shot a cop.

12:13.824 --> 12:15.156
Shut the hell up!

12:15.158 --> 12:16.708
You're not gonna die.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.427
We're trapped in here, ok.

12:18.429 --> 12:20.796
But we got one thing
they want--

12:20.798 --> 12:22.381
all them.

12:24.667 --> 12:27.302
They're using the hostages
as human shields.

12:27.304 --> 12:29.771
This is the first time they've been
interrupted. What went wrong?

12:29.773 --> 12:31.106
It's a big bank.
It's possible

12:31.108 --> 12:32.558
they weren't
about to round everybody up

12:32.560 --> 12:34.109
before someone
triggered an alarm.

12:34.111 --> 12:35.444
Why haven't they
cut the feed

12:35.446 --> 12:37.029
now that they've
been cornered?

12:37.031 --> 12:38.480
Letting us see inside
gives up a tactical advantage.

12:38.482 --> 12:39.648
They gotta know that.

12:39.650 --> 12:40.866
They don't seem to care.

12:40.868 --> 12:42.951
They're overconfident.
Arrogant, even.

12:42.953 --> 12:44.870
The face card masks
add to their narcissism.

12:44.872 --> 12:47.289
Their personas are
the royalty of poker.

12:47.291 --> 12:48.790
JJ, Reid, and Prentiss,
look at past robberies.

12:48.792 --> 12:49.958
That's gonna be
our victimology.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.577
Pull another analyst
if you need to.

12:51.579 --> 12:53.295
Dave, I want you to handle
negotiations.

12:53.297 --> 12:56.164
And, Morgan, strategize
tactical options with MPD.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.803
Chief Strauss.

13:01.805 --> 13:05.090
The Director ordered me
to supervise your operation.

13:05.092 --> 13:07.059
Puts you right in
the spotlight.

13:07.061 --> 13:10.145
Well, you've got gunmen
with hostages in the Capital.

13:10.147 --> 13:11.563
The Hill's concerned.

13:11.565 --> 13:14.049
We're about to open
lines of communication.

13:14.051 --> 13:15.651
What about
a tactical assault?

13:15.653 --> 13:16.885
I don't think
it's a good idea.

13:16.887 --> 13:19.021
There are hostages in front
of the doors and windows.

13:19.023 --> 13:21.073
What's your
negotiation strategy?

13:21.075 --> 13:22.241
The Jack's bleeding out.

13:22.243 --> 13:23.825
They'll ask for medical
attention.

13:23.827 --> 13:26.445
The female unsub might
have something to say about that.

13:26.447 --> 13:27.746
Look at her body language.

13:27.748 --> 13:31.199
Mm. She is cold
and detached.

13:31.201 --> 13:35.454
The King seems genuinely concerned
about his partner's welfare.

13:35.456 --> 13:37.372
But she couldn't
give a damn.

13:37.374 --> 13:39.207
The men probably
know each other.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.709
Yes.
Garcia?

13:40.711 --> 13:43.078
Shuffling my technofabulous
deck of databases, sir.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.631
Hey, don't look.

13:45.633 --> 13:46.932
It's gonna be ok.

13:46.934 --> 13:49.635
We're all gonna die,
aren't we?

13:50.853 --> 13:54.139
I'm sure the police
will give them what they want.

13:54.141 --> 13:56.257
Stop talking!

13:57.945 --> 13:58.944
It's gotta be the Feds.

13:59.947 --> 14:01.930
I'll be right back.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.149
Who the hell's this?

14:04.151 --> 14:06.985
My name is David Rossi.
I'm with the FBI.

14:06.987 --> 14:08.269
To whom am I speaking?

14:08.271 --> 14:10.772
All right, I want
a doctor sent in,

14:10.774 --> 14:12.374
and then I want out of here.

14:12.376 --> 14:15.160
Well, we certainly
can discuss that.

14:15.162 --> 14:17.079
Let the hostages go
and we'll give you

14:17.081 --> 14:18.964
all the medical help
you need.

14:18.966 --> 14:22.050
I can't do that.
I need the leverage.

14:22.052 --> 14:24.219
How about a sign
of good faith?

14:24.221 --> 14:25.721
Send out the women
and children

14:25.723 --> 14:27.239
and I'll see
what I can do.

14:28.958 --> 14:30.559
He's trying to negotiate.

14:30.561 --> 14:33.812
Negotiate?
We're not playing games.

14:44.574 --> 14:47.526
No, no, no, please!
Daddy!

14:47.528 --> 14:48.994
Either we get what we want

14:48.996 --> 14:52.030
or everyone in this room dies.

14:52.032 --> 14:53.749
Do that
and you get nothing.

14:53.751 --> 14:56.668
Take me instead.
Please.

14:57.503 --> 14:59.838
Take me.

15:06.212 --> 15:08.263
It's ok, baby.

15:09.498 --> 15:11.433
Oh!
Aah!

15:11.435 --> 15:12.500
Daddy!

15:12.502 --> 15:13.935
You better send in some help

15:13.937 --> 15:16.171
or more people are gonna die.

15:21.527 --> 15:23.495
We're sending in a medic.

15:23.497 --> 15:25.530
That's just gonna give them
another hostage.

15:25.532 --> 15:27.682
If they stop shooting
people, it's worth it.

15:27.684 --> 15:29.851
If we give in to one demand,
we'll have to give in to them all.

15:29.853 --> 15:31.236
The Director disagrees.

15:31.238 --> 15:33.238
At least make it an Agent
with medical training.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.124
That way he can take advantage
of an opportunity if it comes.

15:36.126 --> 15:38.243
Fine.

15:39.245 --> 15:41.079
The brass thinks
they'll act rationally,

15:41.081 --> 15:42.581
but there's no evidence
of that.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.549
This is personal
for the men.

15:44.551 --> 15:47.419
The King could have run after the
initial gunfight, but he didn't.

15:47.421 --> 15:49.838
Instead, he pulled the partner
inside out of harm's way.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.757
And stayed with him, while
the woman searched the bank,

15:51.759 --> 15:53.392
presumably
for a way out.

15:53.394 --> 15:56.178
He's more worried about the partner
than he is about her running away.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.301
Garcia, narrow your search.

15:58.326 --> 16:00.149
I think the male unsubs
might even be related.

16:00.150 --> 16:01.382
Roger that.

16:01.384 --> 16:04.069
In 6 robberies no one's
been able to build a sketch

16:04.071 --> 16:06.071
of the unsubs before
they put their masks on.

16:06.073 --> 16:08.273
These witness descriptions
are all over the map.

16:08.275 --> 16:10.575
Probably because of
the trauma suffered inside.

16:10.577 --> 16:12.393
They've been zig-zagging
north and south

16:12.395 --> 16:15.781
but in a relative straight
pattern from Washington, D.C.

16:15.783 --> 16:17.332
This is the largest
bank they've hit.

16:17.334 --> 16:20.168
Before today, it's just been
small branches in rural communities.

16:20.170 --> 16:22.287
So today was always
a part of their plan.

16:22.289 --> 16:24.039
But why the nation's
capital?

16:24.041 --> 16:25.457
To make a statement?

16:25.459 --> 16:27.292
I pulled schematics
from the previous banks.

16:27.294 --> 16:29.294
This is the first one
with metal detectors.

16:29.296 --> 16:30.879
Maybe that's
what went wrong?

16:30.881 --> 16:33.298
No, they cased the branches
too well in advance.

16:33.300 --> 16:35.350
They'd know
to be ready for them.

16:35.352 --> 16:37.135
These are
takeover robberies.

16:37.137 --> 16:39.638
No faces, no passing
notes, no prints.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.306
They're professionals.

16:41.308 --> 16:44.759
Hey, there is something all these
robberies have in common.

16:44.761 --> 16:47.145
The Queen's the only one
who pulls the trigger.

16:49.115 --> 16:51.616
Sir, I found a thing. See, I took
height and weight measurements

16:51.618 --> 16:54.319
and I crossed with
known related offenders

16:54.321 --> 16:55.821
who specialize in bank jobs
and home burglaries--

16:55.823 --> 16:57.038
- Show me.
- Yes.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.424
These are brothers
Chris and Oliver Stratton.

16:59.426 --> 17:02.394
They are petty thieves from Philly,
turned bank robbers in Jersey.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.712
They were put in jail
for two years

17:03.714 --> 17:05.579
after an attempted heist
went sour,

17:05.582 --> 17:08.717
and they were released two months
before the first face card robbery,

17:08.719 --> 17:10.050
and their measurements
are a match.

17:10.053 --> 17:11.803
When didn't the NCIC
database connect them?

17:11.805 --> 17:14.005
Because the brothers
have never used a third partner,

17:14.007 --> 17:15.790
and shooting people's
not part of their M.O.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.843
It looks like they weren't
very successful criminals.

17:17.845 --> 17:20.262
Maybe adding a woman to their team
improved their game.

17:20.263 --> 17:23.631
The woman chose a different
type of victim each time.

17:23.633 --> 17:24.900
It's not just
the security guard.

17:24.902 --> 17:27.685
It's been a mother,
a manager, and a young child.

17:27.688 --> 17:29.070
She shoots them in the gut.

17:29.072 --> 17:30.522
They bleed out
while they rob the bank.

17:30.524 --> 17:33.241
She's sadistic.
She gets off on her victims' pain

17:33.243 --> 17:35.694
and the fear it incites
in those around her.

17:35.696 --> 17:37.395
Move him out of here.

17:39.416 --> 17:40.949
Stay with me, Olly.

17:40.951 --> 17:42.450
Where's my medic?

17:42.452 --> 17:44.169
I don't see him.

17:44.171 --> 17:48.006
Kill someone else, then.
Make them listen.

17:48.008 --> 17:50.709
It also appears the King is in charge of
the money-grabbing operation

17:50.711 --> 17:52.961
while the Queen keeps track of time
making sure they're in an out

17:52.963 --> 17:54.329
in under two minutes.

17:54.331 --> 17:56.715
She's more in control
of the operation than they let on.

17:56.717 --> 17:58.133
Turning the King and Queen
against each other

17:58.135 --> 17:59.667
could be the key
to disarming them.

17:59.669 --> 18:02.103
He's not a killer.
That could be our in.

18:02.105 --> 18:03.772
Only if the Jack
doesn't die.

18:03.774 --> 18:05.123
If he does...

18:08.561 --> 18:11.029
No, no, no. I want you
to put that in your bag.

18:11.031 --> 18:13.365
The woman's probably going
to want to search you.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.700
But Chris is gonna be too focused
on getting aid to his brother

18:15.702 --> 18:18.069
to delay long enough
for her to check the bag, too.

18:18.071 --> 18:19.204
All right.

18:19.206 --> 18:21.206
You're going in to provide
medical assistance.

18:21.208 --> 18:23.358
No unnecessary risks,
you hear me?

18:23.360 --> 18:26.545
Once you stabilize Oliver,
check on the hostage they just shot.

18:26.547 --> 18:28.747
Understood.
He might still be alive.

18:28.749 --> 18:30.365
Do not draw your weapon

18:30.367 --> 18:33.168
unless you can subdue the unsubs
without endangering the hostages.

18:33.170 --> 18:35.003
Yes, sir.

18:42.062 --> 18:44.012
Why hasn't anyone
come in yet?

18:44.014 --> 18:47.265
We're sending in the medic now, Chris.
Tell Oliver help is on the way.

18:47.267 --> 18:48.934
Hurry.

18:48.936 --> 18:51.653
They know our names.

18:55.691 --> 18:58.827
Not all our names.

19:04.867 --> 19:08.036
Is she putting on lipstick?

19:08.038 --> 19:10.505
They're sending someone in.

19:12.174 --> 19:13.174
Chris.

19:13.176 --> 19:15.460
Olly, Olly, no.

19:15.462 --> 19:17.178
No, no, no, stay with me.

19:17.180 --> 19:18.680
What are you doing?

19:18.682 --> 19:20.632
They're sending in a medic.
You're gonna be fine.

19:20.634 --> 19:21.716
I don't feel so fine.

19:21.718 --> 19:25.103
No! No! No!

19:25.105 --> 19:26.972
Get over here!

19:29.058 --> 19:31.393
You're gonna save him,
right?

19:31.395 --> 19:32.527
I'm gonna try.

19:32.529 --> 19:34.696
Oliver, can you hear me?

19:38.734 --> 19:40.652
Come on, Olly.

19:40.654 --> 19:42.787
Stay with me, Oliver.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.993
This is not good, Aaron.

19:47.995 --> 19:50.078
Morgan, tell Green to make a move
before Chris does.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.213
Green, you gotta go.

19:52.215 --> 19:53.781
Green, go.

20:04.810 --> 20:06.144
Oh, my God.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.868
Tactical's
been deployed,

20:24.869 --> 20:26.336
snipers are moving
into position.

20:26.338 --> 20:28.788
The Director's
ordered a full tactical assault.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.540
His last orders
cost us an agent.

20:30.542 --> 20:32.008
SWAT's getting
itchy fingers.

20:32.010 --> 20:34.544
You remind SWAT that bank
robberies are federal jurisdiction.

20:34.546 --> 20:36.026
No one fires until
they're ordered to.

20:36.051 --> 20:37.014
Right.

20:37.015 --> 20:39.415
All right, when the crossfire starts,
what's gonna happen

20:39.417 --> 20:41.100
to the hostages
caught in the middle?

20:41.102 --> 20:42.769
That's the wrong call,
Erin, and you know it.

20:42.771 --> 20:44.103
It's not my call.

20:44.105 --> 20:45.471
You're here
and you're in charge.

20:45.473 --> 20:46.889
So you want me to disobey
the Director?

20:46.891 --> 20:47.923
Yes.

20:47.925 --> 20:50.143
No, I just want you
to buy us a little time.

20:50.145 --> 20:52.028
Don't be quite so efficient.

20:53.731 --> 20:57.150
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

20:57.152 --> 21:00.153
All right. Reasoning with them
is still our best option.

21:00.155 --> 21:02.405
That'll be difficult.
Chris just lost his brother

21:02.407 --> 21:04.207
and murdered someone
in retaliation.

21:04.209 --> 21:06.209
We're dealing with
two killers now.

21:06.211 --> 21:07.627
We have problems, sirs.

21:07.629 --> 21:10.313
Outside nefarious sources have
hacked into the surveillance feeds.

21:10.315 --> 21:12.915
I'm trying to I.D. them now. At least
a couple of them are media outlets.

21:12.917 --> 21:14.000
Can you block them?

21:14.002 --> 21:16.486
No, not without blocking
ourselves, too, sir.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.008
Put him with the others.

21:28.349 --> 21:30.350
Hey! Everybody move
forward 5 feet.

21:30.352 --> 21:32.568
Come on!
Move forward 5 feet!

21:32.570 --> 21:35.605
Line up!

21:44.114 --> 21:45.698
I'm sorry about Olly.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.166
Just shut up, would you.

21:47.168 --> 21:49.419
We've got to pull ourselves
together, figure a way out of here.

21:49.421 --> 21:50.753
What happened? Hmm?

21:50.755 --> 21:54.173
Who triggered the alarm?

21:57.261 --> 21:58.428
Was it you?

21:58.430 --> 22:00.430
Calm down. We need to focus.

22:00.432 --> 22:04.500
Call them back.
Demand an armored truck.

22:04.502 --> 22:08.104
What, you think
they're gonna let us go?

22:08.106 --> 22:09.972
We killed 4 people.
Two cops.

22:09.974 --> 22:14.193
So what? We don't try?
That's just great.

22:14.195 --> 22:16.195
Why don't you
walk over there.

22:16.197 --> 22:17.680
I gotta think
for a minute.

22:17.682 --> 22:20.850
Whatever you say...

22:20.852 --> 22:22.869
Boss.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.040
Ohh!
Oh!

22:33.414 --> 22:36.416
Why'd you have to
make it so quick?

22:36.418 --> 22:39.719
It's better
when they suffer.

22:39.721 --> 22:42.555
I don't get off on it
like you do.

22:42.557 --> 22:43.756
You will.

22:45.093 --> 22:47.643
Look.

22:47.645 --> 22:49.829
We're gonna be famous.

22:52.099 --> 22:55.318
Agent Prentiss, there's a call
for you from Interpol.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.652
Take a message, please.

22:56.654 --> 22:59.105
It's Clyde Easter.

23:00.607 --> 23:01.774
Your old unit chief?

23:01.776 --> 23:03.242
He says he has information

23:03.244 --> 23:05.511
about the Queen of Diamonds.

23:11.453 --> 23:13.202
Sorry I missed your funeral,
by the way.

23:13.204 --> 23:14.704
I was held up in Prague.

23:14.706 --> 23:16.172
So you're not surprised.

23:16.174 --> 23:17.573
Of course not.

23:17.575 --> 23:19.575
Keeping tabs
on my former assets

23:19.577 --> 23:22.011
is a particular skill
of mine.

23:22.013 --> 23:24.630
Ok, what can you tell me
about my mystery woman?

23:24.632 --> 23:28.267
Ah, yes. Well, um, if she seems
familiar to you, she should.

23:28.269 --> 23:31.103
We don't know her identity,
but we've seen her before.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.689
She's struck a number
of banks worldwide, including--

23:33.691 --> 23:36.893
Paris! There was a robbery
when I was relocated there.

23:36.895 --> 23:38.144
Someone died.

23:38.146 --> 23:40.029
Oh, yes. The bank manager,
Glenn Harrison.

23:40.031 --> 23:41.030
Gut shot?

23:41.032 --> 23:43.232
Yes.
How did you know?

23:43.234 --> 23:45.985
I don't remember hearing anything
about the robber wearing a mask.

23:45.987 --> 23:47.286
That's because she didn't.

23:47.288 --> 23:49.605
She seems to be wearing
disguises.

23:49.607 --> 23:52.909
Her faces has been seen on camera
by 6 different intelligence agencies

23:52.911 --> 23:54.577
and no one can identify her.

23:54.579 --> 23:58.113
How is that possible?
Wait, who were her partners overseas?

23:58.115 --> 23:59.715
She didn't need any.

23:59.717 --> 24:02.568
Then why would she now?

24:03.837 --> 24:06.055
What if the smaller banks
were training runs

24:06.057 --> 24:07.840
from the Stratton brothers?

24:07.842 --> 24:10.626
Well, it could be. She took
two relatively amateur thugs

24:10.628 --> 24:13.479
and turned them into an elite
team of efficient bank robbers.

24:13.481 --> 24:15.982
But why? To turn them
into patsies?

24:15.984 --> 24:17.466
All right, ok,
so let's look at it.

24:17.468 --> 24:18.985
Up until now they've been
highly organized,

24:18.987 --> 24:20.302
striking
only on deposit days,

24:20.304 --> 24:21.988
when the most amount
of cash is on hand.

24:21.990 --> 24:23.973
But today's different.
It's their first Saturday hit,

24:23.975 --> 24:26.859
where families are present,
more foot traffic throughout the day.

24:26.861 --> 24:28.077
It's a riskier attack.

24:28.079 --> 24:29.662
We should consider the
media attention, too.

24:29.664 --> 24:31.030
It's the first time
they've had an audience.

24:31.032 --> 24:34.316
That might be why
the female unsub is so vain.

24:34.318 --> 24:36.369
She wants to look good
for the cameras.

24:36.371 --> 24:41.340
She searches the bank but doesn't
actually look for a means of escape.

24:41.342 --> 24:45.294
She appears to be almost
enjoying the situation.

24:45.296 --> 24:48.431
We know the brothers are in it
for the money. What's she in it for?

24:51.553 --> 24:53.386
Where the hell
have you been?

24:53.388 --> 24:54.720
I've been looking
for an escape route.

24:54.722 --> 24:56.171
There isn't one.

24:56.173 --> 24:59.725
So much for your no back doors,
no surprises plan. You screwed us.

25:01.178 --> 25:03.729
Then why don't you negotiate
a way out of here already?

25:07.402 --> 25:08.367
What?

25:08.369 --> 25:10.703
How do you want
to end this, Chris?

25:10.705 --> 25:11.954
I want out of here.

25:11.956 --> 25:13.355
How do you propose
to do that?

25:13.357 --> 25:14.874
I want an armored truck

25:14.876 --> 25:17.827
and a plane with a clear
flight path to Switzerland.

25:17.829 --> 25:19.745
No, no, no. Chad.

25:19.747 --> 25:22.298
We want to go to Chad.

25:22.300 --> 25:25.134
Yeah. No agents
with guns this time.

25:25.136 --> 25:26.368
We'll fly ourselves.

25:30.390 --> 25:33.042
Don't do that again.

25:33.044 --> 25:35.094
I'm in charge here.

25:39.433 --> 25:40.816
Huh.

25:41.718 --> 25:43.603
Ok, so what's
the significance of Chad?

25:43.605 --> 25:46.606
A 2008 coup attempt plunged
them into political instability.

25:46.608 --> 25:48.824
They're currently
in the middle of a civil war.

25:48.826 --> 25:51.360
There's gotta be
more to it than that.

25:51.362 --> 25:53.529
Our ghost
wants to go to Chad.

25:53.531 --> 25:56.165
I'm figuring you're my best
chance of finding out why.

25:56.167 --> 25:57.750
Chad? That's an odd choice.

25:57.752 --> 26:00.169
They're not exactly
hospitable this time of year.

26:00.171 --> 26:02.288
They said they could
fly themselves there.

26:02.290 --> 26:05.958
Nothing suggests that Chris
would have that ability, so she must.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.844
Hmm. Well, unfortunately,
Interpol doesn't have many assets

26:08.846 --> 26:11.180
in that particular region
in Africa.

26:11.182 --> 26:15.184
Maybe that's something that you
could help me with when this is over.

26:15.186 --> 26:17.853
Work for Interpol again?
That'll be the day.

26:17.855 --> 26:19.855
Not work, darling. Run.

26:19.857 --> 26:21.857
You see, I've been promoted.

26:21.859 --> 26:24.527
So, the team's yours
whenever you want it.

26:24.529 --> 26:26.946
It's a hell of a time
to bring that up.

26:26.948 --> 26:29.782
Well, you know, in our line of work,
there's never a good time.

26:29.784 --> 26:31.450
Think about it.

26:31.452 --> 26:32.935
Please?

26:32.937 --> 26:37.289
You find me a connection I can use
and maybe we'll discuss it.

26:55.225 --> 26:57.927
The FBI's making good
on its promise.

26:57.929 --> 26:59.478
We'll be out of here soon.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.480
We're taking him
with us.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.817
These guys were too good
to get caught,

27:04.819 --> 27:06.301
so why did they?

27:06.303 --> 27:09.638
911 received a call alerting them
to a robbery in progress.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.358
Actually, it was a text.

27:12.360 --> 27:16.112
D.C. add 911 messaging after
the Virginia Tech students texts

27:16.114 --> 27:18.080
went unanswered
during the massacre.

27:18.082 --> 27:19.481
Can you trace it, Garcia?

27:19.483 --> 27:22.151
Yeah. The message
was sent from a cell phone

27:22.153 --> 27:23.536
that is currently
inside the bank

27:23.538 --> 27:26.005
and was registered
to a Larry Phillips Jr.

27:26.007 --> 27:27.707
Why does that name
sound familiar?

27:27.709 --> 27:29.324
That's the name
of one of the gunmen

27:29.326 --> 27:32.712
from the '97 North Hollywood
bank shootout in California.

27:32.714 --> 27:34.329
So is this an homage?

27:34.331 --> 27:36.732
Guys, that text was sent
30 seconds before they blacked out

27:36.734 --> 27:38.333
the security feeds for entry.

27:38.335 --> 27:39.719
How is that possible?

27:39.721 --> 27:42.354
It didn't come from a hostage.
It came from one of the robbers.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.939
She wanted us here.

27:56.331 --> 27:58.465
There's no clear line of sight
to the vault.

27:58.467 --> 28:00.667
No, but if we come in, that's where
they'll go. We need to be ready for it.

28:00.669 --> 28:03.687
Garcia caught us up.
Why instigate a hostage situation?

28:03.689 --> 28:06.523
What's a narcissist without attention?
She thrives on it.

28:06.525 --> 28:08.225
She must have something
bigger in mind.

28:08.227 --> 28:10.110
We need to separate
Chris and the female

28:10.112 --> 28:11.528
to find out
what that is.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.947
It's not going to be hard.
They're already on edge.

28:13.949 --> 28:15.699
It's more than
the media outlets, sir.

28:15.701 --> 28:18.785
Anonymous international entities
are hacking the feeds as well.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.209
You were saying?

28:26.211 --> 28:27.878
I was tagging
I.P. addresses

28:27.880 --> 28:29.922
and someone hacked
the surveillance cameras

28:29.947 --> 28:31.082
at 7 a.m. this morning.

28:31.083 --> 28:33.500
Was that how they shut down
the cameras for entry?

28:33.502 --> 28:36.536
So, sir. This is an entirely
different hack, one that's still receiving.

28:36.538 --> 28:39.840
Somebody else
is watching. Who?

28:39.842 --> 28:41.675
Whoever it is
she's dressing up for.

28:41.677 --> 28:43.143
I thought that
was for the media.

28:43.145 --> 28:45.044
The media didn't have
eyes inside before today.

28:45.046 --> 28:47.814
But she dresses up
every time.

28:47.816 --> 28:50.150
Because someone
is always watching.

28:51.552 --> 28:53.437
Her real partner,
a fourth unsub.

28:53.439 --> 28:55.572
I doubt
if she was forthcoming

28:55.574 --> 28:57.557
about this other partner
to Chris.

28:57.559 --> 29:01.128
I think it's time
we bring Chris up to speed.

29:01.996 --> 29:04.614
You know my favorite card
in poker, Chris?

29:04.616 --> 29:05.916
What's that?

29:05.918 --> 29:06.900
The wild card.

29:06.902 --> 29:08.368
I don't believe
in wild cards.

29:08.370 --> 29:09.586
They dumb down the game.

29:09.588 --> 29:11.121
Well, I couldn't agree
with you more,

29:11.123 --> 29:14.073
but, uh, in this case,
you're the one that's dumb.

29:14.075 --> 29:17.344
This your new negotiation tactic,
insulting me?

29:17.346 --> 29:18.879
Oh, it's not a tactic.

29:18.881 --> 29:20.597
It's a fact.

29:20.599 --> 29:22.833
Didn't you wonder
why you got caught,

29:22.835 --> 29:26.419
what went wrong
when you did everything right?

29:26.421 --> 29:30.524
We got a message from someone in the bank
before you started shooting.

29:30.526 --> 29:31.641
Impossible.

29:31.643 --> 29:33.193
Now, I know it wasn't you,

29:33.195 --> 29:35.145
and I'm hoping
it wasn't your brother.

29:35.147 --> 29:37.781
So, who does that leave?

29:37.783 --> 29:39.316
You're lying.

29:39.318 --> 29:42.119
Ask her.

29:42.121 --> 29:43.453
Did you call the police?

29:43.455 --> 29:46.206
Is that what
they're telling you?

29:46.208 --> 29:47.624
That's not an answer.

29:47.626 --> 29:49.459
Of course not.
What do you think?

29:49.461 --> 29:51.945
They're trying to turn us
against one another.

29:51.947 --> 29:55.048
Why would you even do that?
Olly's dead 'cause of that.

29:55.050 --> 29:58.084
I wouldn't.
I'm trapped here, too.

29:58.086 --> 30:00.637
Are you lying to me?

30:00.639 --> 30:03.390
We've come to far
for you to start doubting me now.

30:03.392 --> 30:06.176
Lost too much.

30:06.178 --> 30:07.177
Hey.

30:07.179 --> 30:09.963
Hey...

30:09.965 --> 30:12.516
Don't let them
tear us apart

30:12.518 --> 30:15.552
right as
we're about to win.

30:17.071 --> 30:19.322
If you do that,

30:19.324 --> 30:23.827
Olly's death
won't mean anything.

30:27.832 --> 30:29.816
Enough. I'm done
talking to you.

30:29.818 --> 30:33.036
I want to talk to someone who won't
jerk me around face to face.

30:33.038 --> 30:34.337
No more Feds.

30:34.339 --> 30:37.323
I want to talk to the cop
who shot my brother.

30:40.261 --> 30:42.596
No. No, forget it.

30:42.598 --> 30:45.015
JJ, if it means
we can end this...

30:45.017 --> 30:46.716
What makes you think
he won't shoot you

30:46.718 --> 30:48.268
the minute you walk inside?

30:48.270 --> 30:51.504
Look, he wants out of there
just as much as we want him out.

30:51.506 --> 30:53.306
It's not happening.
Forget it.

30:53.308 --> 30:56.193
There's no guarantee he won't
retaliate for the death of his brother.

30:56.195 --> 30:59.029
I know you'd do it
if you were me.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.564
Will, I get
what you're feeling,

31:00.566 --> 31:02.732
but you are too close
to this case to make that call.

31:02.734 --> 31:04.517
You're damn right I'm close.

31:04.519 --> 31:07.404
4 people are dead
because I shot his brother.

31:07.406 --> 31:09.956
And no one else needs to die
'cause of what I did.

31:09.958 --> 31:11.024
This isn't about you.

31:11.026 --> 31:13.159
Risking your life
won't bring them back.

31:13.161 --> 31:14.544
Sorry, Will.

31:15.580 --> 31:18.131
Where's that cop, huh?
I ain't got all day.

31:18.133 --> 31:20.533
What you're asking
is difficult.

31:20.535 --> 31:21.801
Well,
I'll make it easy.

31:21.803 --> 31:23.053
Send in the cop,

31:23.055 --> 31:25.204
I'll let a couple
hostages go.

31:25.206 --> 31:26.873
A sign of good faith.
Isn't that what you said?

31:26.875 --> 31:30.209
Releasing the hostages
is a great first step

31:30.211 --> 31:31.696
in resolving this conflict,

31:31.721 --> 31:34.181
but we can't send someone
else in to be killed.

31:34.182 --> 31:36.816
This ain't a friggin' debate.

31:40.104 --> 31:43.056
Come on, bud. Let's go!

31:43.058 --> 31:44.524
Pick up the phone.

31:44.526 --> 31:45.942
Why?

31:45.944 --> 31:47.494
Pick up the phone!

31:50.948 --> 31:52.332
Hello?

31:52.334 --> 31:54.951
Tell him your name.

31:54.953 --> 31:57.254
It's...

31:57.256 --> 31:59.139
It's Shawn Harper.

32:02.209 --> 32:06.913
Ucch. You just killed
Shawn Harper. Not me, you.

32:06.915 --> 32:09.266
I'm gonna shoot another
hostage every 60 seconds

32:09.268 --> 32:11.851
until you send in the cop.

32:11.853 --> 32:13.303
Every 60 seconds.

32:17.191 --> 32:19.609
Who's next? Huh?

32:19.611 --> 32:22.312
He's threatening to shoot more
hostages unless he has Will.

32:22.314 --> 32:23.980
Screw this. I'm going in.

32:23.982 --> 32:25.198
No, you're not.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.566
We are.

32:26.568 --> 32:29.319
Who's the lucky one?

32:31.489 --> 32:36.543
Nah. Nah. Nah.
Nah. Nah.

32:38.412 --> 32:39.445
You!

32:39.447 --> 32:40.730
No!

32:41.882 --> 32:45.468
No.

32:45.470 --> 32:46.503
Pick it up.

32:46.505 --> 32:49.055
Come on.

32:49.057 --> 32:50.056
What's your name?

32:50.058 --> 32:51.257
No, please.

32:51.259 --> 32:52.726
Tell him your name!

32:52.728 --> 32:54.177
Annie.

32:54.179 --> 32:55.812
It's Annie.

32:55.814 --> 32:58.148
You hang in there, Annie.
Help is on the way.

32:58.150 --> 33:00.650
You got about 30 seconds,
Annie.

33:00.652 --> 33:03.837
I hope Agent Rossi
doesn't make me shoot you, too.

33:09.327 --> 33:10.327
You ok?

33:10.329 --> 33:11.494
Yes.

33:11.496 --> 33:13.330
Hey, you.

33:13.332 --> 33:14.664
Come over here.

33:14.666 --> 33:16.866
It's ok.
No, I--

33:20.487 --> 33:23.206
Just let the women
and children go.

33:23.208 --> 33:25.291
They don't
need to see this.

33:26.845 --> 33:29.829
Pretty soon they're gonna be
doing a lot more than just seeing.

33:29.831 --> 33:33.166
Annie! You just got
yourself a reprieve.

33:33.168 --> 33:35.352
Get in line over there.

33:37.938 --> 33:40.273
Look at our new contender.

33:40.275 --> 33:42.108
Let's go!

33:43.811 --> 33:45.528
Go, go, go!

33:53.954 --> 33:55.071
What is he doing?

33:55.073 --> 33:56.206
No. No, no, no.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.540
No, no.
Morgan--

33:57.542 --> 33:58.575
Let me go, please!

33:58.577 --> 33:59.576
I can't do that.

33:59.578 --> 34:02.862
Will! Will! Will!

34:02.864 --> 34:05.999
Will...stop.

34:06.834 --> 34:08.134
My name is Matthew Downs.

34:08.136 --> 34:10.837
- Huh.
- Look.

34:18.228 --> 34:20.563
Let those people go.

34:20.565 --> 34:24.333
All right, you, you, you.
The kids. Get out.

34:27.655 --> 34:30.190
Got 3 coming out.
Hold your fire.

34:32.493 --> 34:33.643
Thank you.

34:36.831 --> 34:38.114
Hey.

34:38.116 --> 34:39.833
What's your name?

34:40.668 --> 34:44.087
William LaMontagne Jr.

34:44.089 --> 34:45.955
MPD.

34:52.346 --> 34:54.464
Ohh! Oh!

35:15.727 --> 35:19.280
Did you see
where he was shot?

35:21.645 --> 35:24.263
Is he alive or dead, Garcia?

35:24.265 --> 35:25.264
I don't know.

35:25.266 --> 35:26.899
He was wearing a vest.

35:26.901 --> 35:28.767
He might be ok.

35:28.769 --> 35:31.621
Might be.

35:31.623 --> 35:33.906
They're not answering.

35:33.908 --> 35:35.157
All right,
we need to get inside.

35:35.159 --> 35:36.292
JJ, it's too risky.

35:36.294 --> 35:38.194
We don't have eyes
in there anymore.

35:39.663 --> 35:41.664
Aaron...

35:42.499 --> 35:44.417
Let's go in.

35:54.478 --> 35:57.563
Hold your hands
right there.

35:57.565 --> 36:00.983
What are you doing?

36:00.985 --> 36:04.654
A dead cop isn't going to be
much of a negotiation tool.

36:04.656 --> 36:06.022
Huh.

36:06.024 --> 36:10.276
Boss, are you good
with this?

36:10.278 --> 36:13.162
What? Yeah, fine.

36:18.318 --> 36:20.002
You ok?

36:20.004 --> 36:21.537
I shouldn't have
done that.

36:21.539 --> 36:23.706
They're never gonna
let us out of here now.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.708
Who knows? Maybe
they'll save him

36:25.710 --> 36:29.095
and he'll be
our ticket out of here.

36:29.097 --> 36:30.730
You took my advice.

36:32.182 --> 36:33.933
How's that?

36:34.851 --> 36:37.836
You didn't
go for the kill shot.

36:37.838 --> 36:38.854
Hmm.

36:38.856 --> 36:40.199
Right.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.387
I need to check the back again.
There's gotta be an escape

36:42.389 --> 36:43.746
we haven't thought of.

36:44.512 --> 36:45.978
Ok.

36:45.980 --> 36:49.115
His blood pressure's
dropping.

36:49.117 --> 36:51.067
Hold that. Are you holding it
as tight as you can?

36:51.069 --> 36:52.368
Yeah.

36:53.704 --> 36:55.071
How's JJ?

36:55.073 --> 36:56.205
It's bad, Reid.

36:56.207 --> 36:57.323
I should be there.

36:57.325 --> 36:58.908
We've learned everything
we can from here.

36:58.910 --> 37:00.459
No, you can help more
by helping me.

37:00.461 --> 37:02.328
There's a lot to got over and your
brain works faster than mine.

37:02.330 --> 37:05.698
Seeing what's going on
outside doesn't help us inside.

37:07.884 --> 37:10.302
Kevin, can you possibly pull up
each of the surveillance feeds

37:10.304 --> 37:11.587
prior to Will being shot?

37:11.589 --> 37:13.255
Sure. What are we looking for?

37:13.257 --> 37:14.757
The female unsub
disappeared once before.

37:14.759 --> 37:16.892
If she was looking
for an escape,

37:16.894 --> 37:19.145
what was she doing?

37:23.550 --> 37:25.267
I'm sorry.

37:25.269 --> 37:27.720
Keep the pressure. Keep the pressure.
The pain won't kill him,

37:27.722 --> 37:29.238
but the loss of blood
could.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.324
Just hang in there,
buddy.

37:32.326 --> 37:34.694
Are you armed?

37:34.696 --> 37:35.695
No.

37:35.697 --> 37:36.912
Damn.

37:36.914 --> 37:39.165
I think we might have
something of a chance here.

37:39.167 --> 37:41.066
What?

37:41.068 --> 37:43.402
The girl's gone,
and the guy's off his head.

37:43.404 --> 37:45.237
He doesn't know
who to trust.

37:45.239 --> 37:46.672
We can work them
against each other.

37:46.674 --> 37:49.375
Wait, are you a cop?

37:49.377 --> 37:50.693
A former marine.

37:53.013 --> 37:54.797
You gotta listen to me.

37:54.799 --> 37:57.767
I need you to get a message
to my girlfriend.

37:57.769 --> 38:00.219
All right, you can tell her yourself
when we get you out of here.

38:00.221 --> 38:02.471
Only I'm not getting out.

38:02.473 --> 38:04.974
You need someone
to cause a distraction.

38:06.394 --> 38:08.277
Her name is Jennifer,

38:08.279 --> 38:12.782
and she's a federal agent.

38:12.784 --> 38:14.817
You tell her I'm sorry.

38:14.819 --> 38:16.101
Sorry?

38:16.103 --> 38:18.571
Don't you want to tell her
you love her or something?

38:18.573 --> 38:21.957
She already knows that.

38:26.079 --> 38:29.131
The woman.

38:29.133 --> 38:31.300
What happened to her?

38:31.302 --> 38:33.586
Aren't you dead yet?

38:33.588 --> 38:34.887
You can't trust her.

38:34.889 --> 38:37.389
She's taking orders
from someone else.

38:37.391 --> 38:39.892
No, she takes orders
from me.

38:39.894 --> 38:42.094
Look around.

38:42.096 --> 38:45.130
Any second agents
are gonna storm into this place,

38:45.132 --> 38:47.299
and the only bad guy
I see is you.

38:47.301 --> 38:50.803
She's setting you up
to take the fall for this, boy.

38:50.805 --> 38:52.571
That's not true.

38:52.573 --> 38:54.690
Then where is she?

38:54.692 --> 38:56.408
She's back there.

38:56.410 --> 38:58.160
Huh.

38:58.162 --> 39:00.196
All right. You.

39:00.198 --> 39:01.664
Come here.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.332
I'll show you.

39:03.334 --> 39:05.251
Go on.

39:06.787 --> 39:08.337
Come on!

39:10.290 --> 39:11.924
Where are they going?

39:11.926 --> 39:14.343
He's giving us our chance.

39:17.514 --> 39:19.265
We've got movement.

39:19.267 --> 39:21.934
Somebody's coming out.
Be ready.

39:21.936 --> 39:22.885
It's hostages.

39:22.887 --> 39:24.620
Copy.
Standing by for entry.

39:41.538 --> 39:41.570
What the hell
are you doing down here?

39:43.356 --> 39:45.708
Calm down.
You'll find out soon.

39:45.710 --> 39:47.376
Tell me.

39:49.546 --> 39:51.714
We're going in.

40:09.866 --> 40:12.768
She was following
the electrical lines...

40:12.770 --> 40:14.236
gas mains. Oh, no.

40:14.238 --> 40:16.488
Garcia, get them
out of there!

40:16.490 --> 40:18.157
Abort! Abort!

41:00.358 --> 41:02.776
JJ!

41:02.778 --> 41:06.013
JJ, are you all right?

41:06.015 --> 41:07.281
Are you ok?

41:07.283 --> 41:08.949
Where's Will?

41:08.951 --> 41:12.136
Where is Will?
Did he get out of there?

41:17.542 --> 41:19.026
Where's Emily?

41:20.078 --> 41:21.545
JJ!

41:29.037 --> 41:31.055
Here I come! Police!

41:33.208 --> 41:34.425
Will!

41:34.427 --> 41:36.393
Emily!

41:53.895 --> 41:56.537
There's been an explosion
at Colonial Liberty Bank

41:56.562 --> 41:57.398
in the judicial district.

41:57.399 --> 41:59.067
Authorities right now
at the scene say they

41:59.092 --> 42:00.452
don't yet have a casualty...

42:00.453 --> 42:02.670
I can't get through. Even the
SAT phone's got a busy signal.

42:02.672 --> 42:04.455
What do we do?
What are we supposed to do?

42:04.457 --> 42:06.624
I'm gonna get over there.

42:06.626 --> 42:08.489
Again, breaking news--
an explosion at

42:08.514 --> 42:09.794
Colonial Liberty Bank,

42:09.795 --> 42:11.882
killing a possible 24 hostages

42:11.907 --> 42:14.279
and an unknown number
of law enforcement agents.

42:16.417 --> 42:18.085
What is going on here?

42:18.087 --> 42:20.754
You didn't profile this
as a suicide mission.

42:20.756 --> 42:22.756
Because it wasn't.
They'd never kill themselves.

42:22.758 --> 42:24.058
What the hell
do you call that, then?

42:24.060 --> 42:25.526
They didn't improvise
a way out.

42:25.528 --> 42:27.761
They've had an exit
strategy in place.

42:27.763 --> 42:30.147
You don't learn
explosives overnight.

42:30.149 --> 42:32.099
We're looking for signatures
on the bombs.

42:32.101 --> 42:34.234
I need every fragment of
every device that you can find,

42:34.236 --> 42:36.036
no matter how small
or destroyed it looks.

42:36.038 --> 42:38.789
I also need eyes on every angle
in, out, and around the bank.

42:38.791 --> 42:40.207
You have photos
of the suspects.

42:40.209 --> 42:41.659
We're going to continue
to cross-check those

42:41.661 --> 42:43.294
against international
connections.

42:43.296 --> 42:44.578
Do you have a positive
I.D. on the woman yet?

42:44.580 --> 42:46.497
We need more agents.
No. Not yet.

42:46.499 --> 42:47.665
Where's Homeland Security?

42:47.667 --> 42:48.916
They just got here.

42:50.386 --> 42:52.836
Sir, I've see Morgan and JJ,
but I haven't seen Emily.

42:52.838 --> 42:54.388
Emily?

42:54.390 --> 42:56.840
Over here!

42:58.126 --> 42:59.093
You all right?

42:59.095 --> 43:01.979
Yeah. They were
hiding back here.

43:01.981 --> 43:03.597
Can we move them?

43:03.599 --> 43:05.432
Yeah, with help.
He's unconscious.

43:05.434 --> 43:07.818
Just let me stay with him.

43:07.820 --> 43:10.104
Please.

43:11.239 --> 43:13.524
I can't find Will.
Have you seen him?

43:13.526 --> 43:15.609
He might be
down below.

43:15.611 --> 43:18.329
We're gonna
get you out of here.

43:18.331 --> 43:23.734
He's my love of 66 years.

43:23.736 --> 43:27.638
My story.

43:35.630 --> 43:38.349
Yeah. No, it's bad,
but I'm all right.

43:38.351 --> 43:40.601
Yeah, just don't come
into the city.

43:40.603 --> 43:43.437
And can you take Jack
on the bike ride today?

43:43.439 --> 43:46.506
Right. And can you
put him on?

43:46.508 --> 43:48.525
Hey, buddy, listen,
um, I gotta work,

43:48.527 --> 43:51.128
so Beth's gonna take you
on the bike ride, ok?

43:51.130 --> 43:54.114
All right,
I'll see you later.

43:54.116 --> 43:55.566
Can you keep
the media busy?

43:55.568 --> 43:57.317
- Is that all?
- For now.

43:57.319 --> 43:58.702
Yeah. You?
You all right.

43:58.704 --> 44:01.538
Do me a favor.
Have that ear looked at.

44:32.187 --> 44:34.188
If this one's parallel
to some Metro tunnel,

44:34.190 --> 44:35.656
there's a good chance
it branches off.

44:35.658 --> 44:37.224
All right,
then we split up.

44:37.226 --> 44:38.558
Unless it's a trick.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.393
Well, then we're screwed.

45:11.389 --> 45:13.222
Is this the work
of a terrorist cell?

45:13.224 --> 45:17.593
We do not believe that they
are part of any terrorist cells.

45:17.595 --> 45:21.380
The bank heists point to them
being independent anarchists

45:21.382 --> 45:22.765
with homicidal tendencies.

45:22.767 --> 45:24.600
Do you consider them
serial killers?

45:24.602 --> 45:25.601
What was that?

45:25.603 --> 45:26.885
Are they serial killers?

45:26.887 --> 45:29.905
Yes. Without a doubt,
the suspects are serial killers.

45:29.907 --> 45:32.775
As Agent Hotchner told you,
they want you to admire them.

45:32.777 --> 45:35.027
Leaving the cameras on
was their way to brag

45:35.029 --> 45:37.663
about how much fear
they were creating.

45:37.665 --> 45:40.532
We need to know what happened,
specifically the unsubs' behavior

45:40.534 --> 45:42.734
in the minutes
leading up to the blast.

45:42.736 --> 45:44.420
You'll be interviewing
the survivors.

45:44.422 --> 45:46.205
They'll be in various
stages of shock,

45:46.207 --> 45:48.290
but any information
you might get

45:48.292 --> 45:51.093
could be the key
to apprehending these suspects.

45:54.848 --> 45:58.133
Agent Hotchner has compiled a series
of questions for you to ask them.

45:58.135 --> 45:59.802
These questions
are on your phones now.

45:59.804 --> 46:01.687
Thank you.

46:01.689 --> 46:02.938
You're all right.

46:02.940 --> 46:04.974
What are you doing here?
It isn't safe.

46:04.976 --> 46:06.758
I didn't want you
to be alone.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.927
I'm not. You know,
they separate the President

46:08.929 --> 46:11.063
and the Vice President
at times like this.

46:11.065 --> 46:13.866
What...are you comparing us
to POTUS?

46:13.868 --> 46:16.952
I'm saying that you should be
at Quantico running point.

46:16.954 --> 46:18.320
Well, I'm here right now.

46:18.322 --> 46:19.571
What can I do?

46:19.573 --> 46:21.624
Ok. I need to analyze
every frame of this video.

46:21.626 --> 46:23.959
Morgan and JJ said that
the blast created a hole

46:23.961 --> 46:25.794
between the underground vaults
and these tunnels.

46:25.796 --> 46:27.246
You know, most of these
older banks

46:27.248 --> 46:29.214
are made of granite
or limestone for longevity.

46:29.216 --> 46:31.800
So she knew to use
a combination of C-4 and semtex

46:31.802 --> 46:33.118
to open her escape route.

46:33.120 --> 46:34.970
The tunnels let out
at multiple points running west.

46:34.972 --> 46:36.422
She could still
be underground.

46:36.424 --> 46:38.257
I know.
This is what she does.

46:38.259 --> 46:39.827
She probably waited
till the last minute to exit.

46:39.852 --> 46:41.627
She wants to see all this chaos.

46:41.628 --> 46:43.646
We need to find the tunnel
exit closest to the bank.

46:43.648 --> 46:47.650
Looks like it's two blocks here,
just outside the perimeter.

46:57.911 --> 47:00.112
What you got?

47:00.114 --> 47:02.247
Will always say, if you can,
you leave a bread crumb.

47:02.249 --> 47:04.316
Ok, so he was here, and
clearheaded enough to leave us a clue.

47:04.318 --> 47:06.752
They shot him, Morgan.
Why would they take him?

47:06.754 --> 47:09.371
JJ, I don't know, but we didn't see
any blood down there

47:09.373 --> 47:10.956
and he's not here.
Both are good signs.

47:10.958 --> 47:12.887
Yeah, but they have him,
God only knows where

47:12.912 --> 47:14.820
or why. How's not good?

47:22.135 --> 47:26.055
What the hell is that?
You recording it?

47:26.057 --> 47:29.792
I'm talking to you, Izzy!

47:29.794 --> 47:31.694
You planned
this whole thing.

47:31.696 --> 47:33.195
You didn't tell us
any of it.

47:33.197 --> 47:35.647
You set us up.
You killed my brother.

47:35.649 --> 47:36.865
No, that would be him.

47:36.867 --> 47:40.202
How do I know
he isn't your partner?

47:40.204 --> 47:41.954
Why would I work
with this guy?

47:41.956 --> 47:45.240
Why would you
do any of this?

47:46.292 --> 47:49.828
FBI said you got
somebody else.

47:49.830 --> 47:52.081
You sound jealous.

47:52.083 --> 47:53.082
Who is it?

47:53.084 --> 47:54.717
Put that away.

47:54.719 --> 47:57.536
This isn't about revenge,
it's about survival.

47:57.538 --> 47:59.171
If you haven't
figured it out by now,

47:59.173 --> 48:01.673
I'm your only way
out of this mess.

48:01.675 --> 48:04.176
All right.

48:04.178 --> 48:05.894
Let me kill him
so we can get on with it.

48:05.896 --> 48:06.895
We need him.

48:06.897 --> 48:07.879
For what?

48:07.881 --> 48:09.714
Leverage.
We have to patch him up.

48:09.716 --> 48:11.883
What, are you gonna
walk him into an E.R.?

48:17.273 --> 48:19.129
JJ and Morgan said the unsubs
were in an alley

48:19.154 --> 48:21.154
northwest of the perimeter.

48:21.362 --> 48:22.528
Yeah, this footage
confirms it.

48:22.530 --> 48:25.364
Ok, I can see two figures
in the car.

48:25.366 --> 48:26.999
Please tell me
one of them is Will.

48:27.001 --> 48:28.534
See how she's turned.

48:28.536 --> 48:30.402
It's like she's keeping
an eye on someone in the back.

48:30.404 --> 48:31.787
Does this mean
Will's in the car?

48:31.789 --> 48:33.722
There's somebody back there.
What's the license plate?

48:34.758 --> 48:37.593
That's weird.
They're government tags.

48:37.595 --> 48:39.762
- Federal.
- Federal or district?

48:39.764 --> 48:41.096
Well, they're either stolen
or forged.

48:41.098 --> 48:42.414
Who the hell
are these people?

48:42.416 --> 48:45.601
They set up roadblocks
in the district from 66 to Dulles.

48:45.603 --> 48:48.720
Wait. So we're looking for
a black SUV with its sirens on.

48:48.722 --> 48:50.689
That's gonna stand out.

48:50.691 --> 48:53.525
Will's with them.
I found his wallet.

48:53.527 --> 48:55.727
It benefits them
to keep Will alive.

48:55.729 --> 48:57.729
They must have
a safe house set up.

48:57.731 --> 49:00.532
Whoever their outside man is,
that's where they're heading now.

49:00.534 --> 49:02.317
But where?
What's their end game?

49:02.319 --> 49:04.987
There's no logical reason.
They want to create panic.

49:04.989 --> 49:06.238
She's struck
all over the world,

49:06.240 --> 49:07.956
which says she might not
be American,

49:07.958 --> 49:09.774
but her ideology certainly
speaks to Washington.

49:09.776 --> 49:11.743
Whatever point
she and her partner are making,

49:11.745 --> 49:13.078
it's important
that D.C.'s the setting.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.713
The brothers were
from Philadelphia.

49:14.715 --> 49:16.799
The other partner
might be homegrown as well.

49:16.801 --> 49:18.617
Homeland's sending over
a list of possibilities.

49:18.619 --> 49:19.885
They're not
on anyone's list.

49:19.887 --> 49:21.553
Then how
do we find them?

49:21.555 --> 49:23.258
We find the common denominators
between all 14 robberies

49:23.283 --> 49:25.083
and we go from there.

49:25.142 --> 49:26.842
So she's our only answer.

49:26.844 --> 49:28.010
For now.

49:28.012 --> 49:30.062
I'll call Easter
at Interpol again.

49:30.064 --> 49:33.465
Now that there's been an explosion,
he might have some ideas.

49:40.806 --> 49:44.243
I'm so sorry about what happened.
Is your team all right?

49:44.245 --> 49:46.978
No. One of our own
was taken hostage during the escape.

49:46.980 --> 49:49.147
They made it out of that?

49:49.149 --> 49:51.083
Yeah. In a stolen
government vehicle.

49:51.085 --> 49:53.669
Ah. We've seen that before.

49:53.671 --> 49:55.420
Remember Scotland Yard '04?

49:55.422 --> 49:57.506
A sedan was stolen
from the impound lot.

49:57.508 --> 50:00.626
Yeah, uh, security footage
verified it was a woman,

50:00.628 --> 50:01.826
even though
she was never caught.

50:01.828 --> 50:02.878
No, but they found the car.

50:02.880 --> 50:04.847
She left behind some
fake I.D.s and weapons,

50:04.849 --> 50:07.165
and that's where she got
her moniker, Lady X.

50:07.167 --> 50:10.052
Right. Everybody figured with
that arsenal and her ability to evade,

50:10.054 --> 50:13.021
she was trained,
probably an assassin.

50:13.023 --> 50:15.006
Two days later
an ambassador was killed.

50:15.008 --> 50:17.359
Shot in the stomach.
The question is,

50:17.361 --> 50:19.194
what assassin doesn't
go for the kill shot?

50:19.196 --> 50:20.479
This one. She's sadistic.

50:20.481 --> 50:22.180
Yeah. Fits your profile,
I take it.

50:22.182 --> 50:24.182
Well, yeah, it's gotta be
the same woman.

50:24.184 --> 50:26.184
She killed at each robbery.

50:26.186 --> 50:30.322
The banks were simply a means
to fund today's explosion.

50:30.324 --> 50:31.856
Hmm. Even if
she wears wigs,

50:31.858 --> 50:33.242
she doesn't mind
showing her face,

50:33.244 --> 50:34.859
because she knows
we won't find it.

50:34.861 --> 50:37.195
We've only got one other thing to go on--
what she left behind.

50:37.197 --> 50:39.081
What about Chad?
Is there any connection?

50:39.083 --> 50:40.865
No, no, nothing yet.

50:40.867 --> 50:43.218
But, um,
if I had more help,

50:43.220 --> 50:45.737
say, running the London
Gateway office,

50:45.739 --> 50:47.589
you'd have your answer
much quicker.

50:47.591 --> 50:48.924
Yes, you should fix that.

50:48.926 --> 50:50.642
Well, I'm trying.

50:50.644 --> 50:53.729
You have always
had bad timing.

50:53.731 --> 50:55.480
Oh, come on, Emily.

50:55.482 --> 50:57.549
Don't you miss this?

50:57.551 --> 50:59.017
Think about it.

50:59.885 --> 51:02.938
Yeah, I will.

51:04.407 --> 51:06.891
All right.
Yeah, I got it.

51:06.893 --> 51:09.661
That was the lab. Semtex and C-4
like we thought.

51:09.663 --> 51:11.747
Red, blue, and yellow
wires in each,

51:11.749 --> 51:13.365
old cell phone
used as a detonator.

51:13.367 --> 51:15.033
- How old is the phone?
- 10 years.

51:15.035 --> 51:17.085
That's specific and rare.

51:17.087 --> 51:18.387
Ridiculously.

51:18.389 --> 51:19.555
Well, has anyone
seen it before?

51:19.557 --> 51:21.757
It was last seen in a number of
bombings in Chad.

51:21.759 --> 51:23.091
For a signature
that specific,

51:23.093 --> 51:24.560
they must have been there
to learn it.

51:24.562 --> 51:26.645
Did Easter have
any insight?

51:26.647 --> 51:28.890
A woman they called Lady X
stole a sedan from

51:28.915 --> 51:30.149
Scotland Yard 8 years ago.

51:30.150 --> 51:32.924
The investigation concluded
she was a trained assassin.

51:32.949 --> 51:34.237
She disappeared.

51:34.238 --> 51:36.655
So Lady X and Queen of Diamonds
is the same person?

51:36.657 --> 51:37.773
It sounds like it.

51:37.775 --> 51:39.658
Garcia, look at
assassination attempts

51:39.660 --> 51:41.743
around the civil unrest in Chad.

51:41.745 --> 51:44.162
If she was a hired gun, she was
likely taking orders from someone.

51:44.164 --> 51:45.747
Maybe she's still working
for the same guy now

51:45.749 --> 51:47.366
and he's still
pulling the strings.

51:47.368 --> 51:48.784
Or maybe she's found
her equal.

51:48.786 --> 51:50.836
Their obsession with
killing and domination

51:50.838 --> 51:52.871
has culminated in what
we've seen today.

51:52.873 --> 51:55.591
Getting off on the disaster they've
created. Classic symphorphiliacs.

51:55.593 --> 51:57.759
Then this isn't over.
Far from it.

51:57.761 --> 51:59.310
No. Now that they've
gotten away with this, where

51:59.335 --> 52:01.048
are they gonna strike next?

52:12.758 --> 52:13.976
Morning.

52:13.978 --> 52:15.227
- Yeah?
- We need help.

52:15.229 --> 52:17.279
- Oh, is that a gunshot?
- Obviously.

52:17.281 --> 52:18.539
He's gonna need fluids.

52:18.564 --> 52:20.450
There's a hospital
3 blocks from here.

52:20.451 --> 52:21.933
There's no time.

52:21.935 --> 52:23.635
Fix him.

52:33.451 --> 52:34.892
Will's definitely with them,
and it looks like

52:34.893 --> 52:36.393
he can move without a problem.

52:36.395 --> 52:38.361
Cameras caught everything?

52:38.363 --> 52:40.196
Yeah. The woman
killed the medic.

52:40.198 --> 52:41.347
Hey, at least Will's ok.

52:41.349 --> 52:43.032
Yeah, for now.

52:43.034 --> 52:45.151
Did they leave
in the same vehicle?

52:45.153 --> 52:47.871
Yeah, but it's been an hour
since the explosion.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.856
Why haven't they
left the city?

52:49.858 --> 52:52.692
The next attack
could be here.

52:54.078 --> 52:55.795
Kevin, what have you got?

52:55.797 --> 52:57.530
Just going through...

52:57.532 --> 52:59.215
They did that on purpose,
right?

52:59.217 --> 53:01.050
And you saw everything
until they had Will.

53:01.052 --> 53:02.802
Well, they made a mistake.

53:02.804 --> 53:05.371
Leaving the cameras on gave us much
more information than they realized.

53:05.373 --> 53:06.806
What time did
the 911 text come in?

53:06.808 --> 53:08.040
9:23.

53:08.042 --> 53:09.359
The bank opened at 9:00.

53:09.361 --> 53:11.377
Let's go back to the beginning.
I need you both on this.

53:11.379 --> 53:13.563
Yes, sir.

53:14.398 --> 53:15.982
He said he'd call
by now.

53:20.221 --> 53:22.322
Hey.

53:22.324 --> 53:23.890
Yeah.

53:23.892 --> 53:25.892
Got it.

53:25.894 --> 53:27.193
That was fast.

53:27.195 --> 53:29.245
Change in location.

53:29.247 --> 53:30.880
Get back on Pennsylvania Av.

53:38.005 --> 53:42.008
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me the plan.

53:45.579 --> 53:47.597
What are you doing?

53:47.599 --> 53:48.915
He talks too much.

53:48.917 --> 53:52.268
Go ahead, officer,
get him out.

53:52.270 --> 53:53.636
And do what,
just leave him here?

53:53.638 --> 53:55.905
Yes, please.

54:09.236 --> 54:11.821
Sorry for the mess.

54:15.943 --> 54:19.462
Go ahead. Drive.

54:22.968 --> 54:25.668
The explosion was a distraction
so they could escape. Watch.

54:25.670 --> 54:28.922
Allow me to fast-forward.

54:28.924 --> 54:32.325
All right, here's where Chris
started shooting hostages.

54:34.645 --> 54:37.447
The fella next to him
didn't even flinch.

54:37.449 --> 54:39.349
Doesn't even
break a sweat.

54:39.351 --> 54:41.017
We know he's ex-military,
but still...

54:41.019 --> 54:43.820
His name is Matthew Downs.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.523
That's what he told Rossi
and he wasn't lying.

54:46.525 --> 54:50.410
History shows dishonorable
discharge from USMC in '04.

54:51.529 --> 54:52.695
Hi, Will.

54:53.531 --> 54:54.831
You see that?

54:54.833 --> 54:55.999
I want to do it again.

54:56.001 --> 54:57.217
We will.

54:59.837 --> 55:01.421
Drive.

55:01.423 --> 55:03.489
You know the way.

55:03.491 --> 55:05.692
Drive.

55:07.327 --> 55:09.212
Ok, do me a favor.

55:09.214 --> 55:10.430
Keep going.

55:10.432 --> 55:13.233
To where Will walks in.

55:14.068 --> 55:16.836
Ok, now watch him.

55:16.838 --> 55:19.105
And then...

55:19.107 --> 55:20.356
look at her.

55:21.842 --> 55:23.693
Her partner was in there
the whole time,

55:23.695 --> 55:25.344
just not in the way
that we thought.

55:25.346 --> 55:27.513
They shot this whole thing
like a home movie.

55:27.515 --> 55:29.032
He could have been killed.

55:29.034 --> 55:30.316
No, she wouldn't
let that happen.

55:30.318 --> 55:31.901
What the hell
are they doing?

55:31.903 --> 55:33.469
It's all part of their plan.

55:33.471 --> 55:36.573
They've created scenarios that are
practically impossible to survive.

55:36.575 --> 55:38.024
When they make it,
it's the ultimate high.

55:38.026 --> 55:40.209
Like an adrenaline
junkie.

55:40.211 --> 55:41.461
Nobody can find
Matthew Downs.

55:41.463 --> 55:42.912
ERT said that he helped
them, then he disappeared.

55:42.914 --> 55:44.664
See you later?

55:44.666 --> 55:46.666
You better.

55:50.220 --> 55:52.722
Come on, officer.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.724
He's a detective.

55:54.726 --> 55:56.893
I'm sorry, dick.

56:06.520 --> 56:09.388
You better play nice,
just like we talked about.

56:11.108 --> 56:12.175
Close the gate.

56:12.177 --> 56:13.343
Daddy.

56:14.662 --> 56:16.446
Hey, pal.

56:16.448 --> 56:17.447
Hey, Will.

56:17.449 --> 56:19.082
How are you?

56:19.084 --> 56:21.784
Thanks for taking care
of the little man.

56:21.786 --> 56:23.820
Let me put you down
while I talk to miss Kate.

56:23.822 --> 56:24.837
Ok, daddy.

56:24.839 --> 56:27.406
You haven't been watching
the news?

56:27.408 --> 56:30.593
I heard about what happened, but no,
I didn't want the kids to see it.

56:30.595 --> 56:32.345
You guys working the case?

56:32.347 --> 56:34.347
In shifts, yeah.

56:34.349 --> 56:36.132
Ok, well, if you need
Henry to stay, it's no problem.

56:36.134 --> 56:37.249
Well, uh--

56:37.251 --> 56:38.267
I'm Izzy, Will's cousin.

56:38.269 --> 56:40.186
Oh, hi. I'm Kate.
Nice to meet you.

56:42.356 --> 56:44.107
She just--she just flew in.

56:44.109 --> 56:47.443
She's gonna take care of him,
so it's all good.

56:47.445 --> 56:49.312
All right, well, if you need anything,
let me know.

56:49.314 --> 56:51.247
Ok.
Sure thing.

56:52.549 --> 56:54.651
Hey, Will.
Get some sleep.

56:54.653 --> 56:56.369
You look like hell.

56:59.606 --> 57:01.407
He's still in diapers?

57:01.409 --> 57:03.076
I don't really do those.

57:03.078 --> 57:06.663
You touch my kid,
I swear to God I'll kill you.

57:06.665 --> 57:08.247
I already told you,

57:08.249 --> 57:09.716
you touch me,

57:09.718 --> 57:10.950
he kills her, then you.

57:10.952 --> 57:12.952
Do you really want
to do that to your kid,

57:12.954 --> 57:15.388
be the reason
he's an orphan?

57:15.390 --> 57:18.975
Daddy, let's play.

57:18.977 --> 57:21.144
Daddy can't play
right now.

57:21.146 --> 57:23.129
I gotta go to work.

57:23.131 --> 57:24.463
But this is, uh--

57:24.465 --> 57:25.648
Izzy.

57:25.650 --> 57:26.816
Izzy.

57:26.818 --> 57:28.985
Can you say hi to Izzy?

57:28.987 --> 57:30.737
Hi, Izzy.

57:30.739 --> 57:33.489
She's gonna stay with you
till mama comes home, ok?

57:33.491 --> 57:35.024
Ok.

57:35.026 --> 57:36.442
Hey.

57:36.444 --> 57:39.195
I love you.

57:39.197 --> 57:41.647
I love you.

57:41.649 --> 57:43.533
Come here.

57:44.868 --> 57:46.202
It's gonna be ok.

57:46.204 --> 57:48.171
It's gonna be ok.

57:48.173 --> 57:50.673
All right. I love you.

57:50.675 --> 57:52.992
Go play back there.

58:03.187 --> 58:05.638
Of course Will thought
Matthew was a hostage.

58:05.663 --> 58:07.024
Why wouldn't he?

58:07.025 --> 58:09.525
There's a good chance
Will tried to help him out.

58:09.527 --> 58:10.860
He told him when
to go for the doors

58:10.862 --> 58:13.112
or offered to be a hostage
to save the others.

58:13.114 --> 58:14.147
I'm sure he did.

58:14.149 --> 58:15.782
Well, there's
a flip side to this.

58:15.784 --> 58:17.516
This guy could have
gotten into Will's head.

58:17.518 --> 58:19.869
Is there anything you want to tell
your family in case you don't make it?

58:19.871 --> 58:21.621
You think Will told them
about JJ and Henry?

58:21.623 --> 58:23.790
Unknowingly.

58:23.792 --> 58:26.025
What's wrong?

58:26.027 --> 58:28.578
Will's license is gone.

58:28.580 --> 58:30.296
They know where we live.

58:40.808 --> 58:42.842
Hey, check it out, Will.
Mine looks...

58:42.844 --> 58:45.544
It looks almost
as good as yours, huh?

58:45.546 --> 58:47.814
I wasn't sure if I was
gonna need you at all,

58:47.816 --> 58:50.683
but this way,
it's more fun.

58:50.685 --> 58:52.935
What do you want?

58:52.937 --> 58:53.853
Well, it's simple.

58:53.855 --> 58:56.072
You do everything
I tell you

58:56.074 --> 58:58.724
or Izzy kills your boy.

58:58.726 --> 59:01.244
There is no way out.

59:01.246 --> 59:04.063
Let's don't believe the hype
you're the hero.

59:04.065 --> 59:06.833
Today's not the day
for that, Will.

59:06.835 --> 59:09.418
Come on, we're late.

59:26.359 --> 59:28.050
Don't do that.

59:28.052 --> 59:29.802
What?

59:29.804 --> 59:31.670
Go all quiet.

59:31.672 --> 59:34.673
What am I supposed to do?

59:34.675 --> 59:37.226
Yell.

59:37.228 --> 59:38.944
I can't.

59:38.946 --> 59:40.613
You can't blame yourself.

59:40.615 --> 59:43.449
Want to bet?

59:43.451 --> 59:45.851
I should have never
left Henry today.

59:45.853 --> 59:47.119
You were doing your job.

59:47.121 --> 59:48.070
I'm a mom.

59:48.072 --> 59:49.121
And a federal agent.

59:49.123 --> 59:51.040
I'm a mom first.

59:51.042 --> 59:55.294
Who had no possible way of knowing
how this thing would go.

59:59.132 --> 01:00:01.717
We made this deal,

01:00:01.719 --> 01:00:02.918
Will and I.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.704
That Henry
would never be alone

01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:08.224
without either of us.

01:00:08.226 --> 01:00:10.593
I broke that.

01:00:12.512 --> 01:00:15.231
He'll forgive you.

01:00:18.518 --> 01:00:21.386
Why are you doing this?

01:00:21.388 --> 01:00:24.740
Why am I doing this?

01:00:24.742 --> 01:00:27.576
You ever been in combat?

01:00:27.578 --> 01:00:29.194
No.

01:00:29.196 --> 01:00:31.363
But you think you know
what happens to the souls of men?

01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:33.832
I never said that.
You have no idea.

01:00:33.834 --> 01:00:37.903
Soldiers don't come back
and kill innocent people.

01:00:37.905 --> 01:00:40.405
You were sick before
you ever went to war.

01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:42.741
You've never been.

01:00:44.127 --> 01:00:47.680
It wasn't the same after.

01:00:47.682 --> 01:00:50.415
They just cut you off,
you know?

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:53.969
Everyone. Your family.
The Corps. The country.

01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:55.271
Goodbye.

01:00:55.273 --> 01:00:56.438
We used you.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.723
It's a betrayal.

01:00:57.725 --> 01:00:58.807
So what did I do?

01:00:58.809 --> 01:01:01.727
I found a new home.

01:01:06.483 --> 01:01:08.600
Detective.

01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:10.536
You on lockdown?

01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:12.938
No. We're diverting all traffic.
Official vehicles only.

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.623
We're just here
to do a sweep.

01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:20.763
Yes, sir.
Go on through.

01:01:41.467 --> 01:01:44.019
I thirsty.

01:01:57.584 --> 01:01:59.785
You need to draw it.

01:01:59.787 --> 01:02:02.988
♪ Ring around the rosey ♪

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:06.658
♪ pocketful of posies ♪

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:10.295
♪ ashes, ashes ♪

01:02:10.297 --> 01:02:14.616
♪ we all fall down ♪

01:02:16.186 --> 01:02:17.636
You're silly.

01:02:17.638 --> 01:02:21.223
Can we play
hide-and-seek?

01:02:21.225 --> 01:02:23.508
In a minute.

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:26.011
Come here.

01:02:32.351 --> 01:02:35.487
My grandfather's name
was Henry.

01:02:36.573 --> 01:02:39.391
He had blond hair
just like you.

01:02:39.393 --> 01:02:42.360
He was a scary man.

01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:44.213
Why?

01:02:45.465 --> 01:02:49.585
Let me tell you a story.

01:02:57.894 --> 01:02:59.845
So why didn't they
take all the money?

01:02:59.847 --> 01:03:02.514
They were a man down
and they had to get out in a hurry.

01:03:02.516 --> 01:03:04.883
But for her, today
was less about the money

01:03:04.885 --> 01:03:06.735
and more about
the spectacle.

01:03:06.737 --> 01:03:08.937
Everything they've said
and done was for a reason.

01:03:08.939 --> 01:03:10.253
But what doesn't make
any sense is she switched

01:03:10.278 --> 01:03:11.684
the negotiation demand.

01:03:11.853 --> 01:03:14.288
Chris wanted to go to Switzerland.
She changed it to Chad.

01:03:14.515 --> 01:03:17.132
They also requested a private plane,
but no mention of a pilot.

01:03:17.448 --> 01:03:19.064
Guys, if you
think about it,

01:03:19.066 --> 01:03:20.949
even the dates
mean something.

01:03:20.951 --> 01:03:23.619
In 2004, while she was
wreaking havoc abroad,

01:03:23.621 --> 01:03:24.903
he was dishonorably
discharged.

01:03:24.905 --> 01:03:27.423
Then in 2008,
they likely met in Chad.

01:03:27.425 --> 01:03:29.925
And now this in 2012.

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:33.345
Ok, so is it a coincidence
that those are all election years

01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:34.746
and they attacked D.C.?

01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:36.932
Maybe this is
a political statement.

01:03:36.934 --> 01:03:40.269
No. It's more personal
than that.

01:03:40.271 --> 01:03:42.554
It's their story.

01:03:42.556 --> 01:03:44.289
What?

01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:47.976
All of the details
are a part of their story.

01:03:47.978 --> 01:03:49.094
Their timeline suggests

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:51.063
they were both destructive
before they met.

01:03:51.065 --> 01:03:53.949
So we're talking about
ex-military turning on their country.

01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:56.068
It's rare, but soldiers
become disenfranchised

01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.536
no matter
what the nationality.

01:03:57.538 --> 01:03:59.788
And if he met someone
like-minded at that time,

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:01.457
there'd be
no stopping them.

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:03.709
So you're thinking they met during
the civil unrest in Chad in '08.

01:04:03.711 --> 01:04:05.210
Yeah, and one
or both of them are pilots.

01:04:05.212 --> 01:04:07.830
So if Garcia concentrates
on that region,

01:04:07.832 --> 01:04:10.082
specifically weapons
running in and out of Libya,

01:04:10.084 --> 01:04:12.217
there's a good chance
we'll find their paths crossed.

01:04:12.219 --> 01:04:15.137
Ok, multiple entries
into Libya

01:04:15.139 --> 01:04:16.620
for a private pilot named
Matthew Downs in '08,

01:04:16.645 --> 01:04:18.074
but I don't have her name.

01:04:18.075 --> 01:04:20.058
Well, because
she had aliases.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.343
It's the only way
to stay a ghost.

01:04:21.345 --> 01:04:23.929
Here's the thing--
they are a couple.

01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:25.430
Regardless of what
we believe of them,

01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:28.800
they will celebrate themselves
and their connection.

01:04:28.802 --> 01:04:32.771
Is there anything that happened
on this date in Chad?

01:04:32.773 --> 01:04:35.607
Oh, you are good,
Emily Prentiss.

01:04:35.609 --> 01:04:37.142
But this news is not.

01:04:37.144 --> 01:04:40.312
Yes, there were multiple explosions
on this date in '08.

01:04:40.314 --> 01:04:42.314
Where were the most casualties?

01:04:42.316 --> 01:04:43.582
At a church--
no, no, a train.

01:04:43.584 --> 01:04:45.150
Yep.
Morgan; Semtex and C-4?

01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:47.169
Are trains still arriving
at Union Station?

01:04:47.171 --> 01:04:49.338
Yes, but only the
authorities are allowed in.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.190
That's why
they needed Will.

01:05:00.083 --> 01:05:02.167
She doesn't have her cell.

01:05:02.169 --> 01:05:04.887
Kate would never take
her eyes off Henry like this.

01:05:04.889 --> 01:05:06.471
They must have him.

01:05:06.473 --> 01:05:07.639
Wait.

01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:09.674
We need a distraction.

01:05:19.536 --> 01:05:23.521
I thought you cared
more about your family, Will.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.668
He's gonna want to stay
close to watch.

01:05:42.809 --> 01:05:46.044
Proceed with caution
to the nearest exit.

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:18.010
Please proceed with
caution to the nearest exit.

01:06:18.012 --> 01:06:19.962
Thank you.

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:25.917
Hotch, I got the suspect
going out the east wing.

01:06:25.919 --> 01:06:27.552
Copy.

01:06:35.428 --> 01:06:37.595
I found Will.

01:06:37.597 --> 01:06:39.597
Is he mobile?

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:44.069
Negative. He's got
6 transmitters on him

01:06:44.071 --> 01:06:45.988
and this whole place
is gonna blow.

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.439
All right, where are you?
I'm on my way.

01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:49.658
No, you gotta get everyone out.
Is the bomb squad here yet?

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.993
They're 3 minutes away.

01:06:50.995 --> 01:06:52.110
Copy.

01:06:52.112 --> 01:06:54.112
Emily, you gotta get Henry.

01:06:54.114 --> 01:06:56.164
They're at the house.

01:07:36.622 --> 01:07:39.508
Turn around.

01:07:40.843 --> 01:07:42.044
Mommy!

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.614
Henry!

01:08:27.673 --> 01:08:29.558
Come here.
Mommy.

01:08:39.718 --> 01:08:42.020
Just get everybody
out of here.

01:08:42.022 --> 01:08:44.189
I'm not gonna leave you.
Just give me a minute.

01:08:44.191 --> 01:08:46.224
Just about all you got.

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:48.859
Ok, everything they did
and said was about them.

01:08:48.862 --> 01:08:50.395
Narcissists.

01:08:50.397 --> 01:08:51.863
Romantics.

01:08:51.865 --> 01:08:54.698
They met in 2008.

01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:57.551
Oh, what are you doing?

01:08:57.554 --> 01:09:01.288
Seriously, Emily, go.

01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:02.791
Go.

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.799
Ok, hold on. Chad.

01:09:10.801 --> 01:09:14.136
2-4-2-3.

01:09:14.138 --> 01:09:15.420
Oh! Damn it.

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:18.023
Ok, these are valentines
for her,

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:20.776
so a 4-letter word.
Love, life, soul.

01:09:20.778 --> 01:09:22.277
Izzy.

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:23.511
Her name is Izzy.

01:09:26.816 --> 01:09:28.783
I-z-z-y.

01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:30.118
Oh!

01:09:31.487 --> 01:09:33.488
Oh, God!

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:16.178
Prentiss, what's your status?

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.380
Prentiss, do you copy?

01:10:19.332 --> 01:10:20.945
The storytelling's
in the details.

01:10:20.947 --> 01:10:22.246
Those wires mean something.

01:10:22.248 --> 01:10:23.414
Like what?

01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:25.633
The colors
of the flag of Chad.

01:10:25.635 --> 01:10:26.968
Red, yellow, and blue.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:28.803
Only one is different
from the U.S. flag--yellow.

01:10:28.805 --> 01:10:29.971
What do you think?

01:10:34.643 --> 01:10:36.844
Ohh!

01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:43.651
How did you do that?

01:10:43.653 --> 01:10:45.820
I didn't overthink it.

01:11:23.142 --> 01:11:26.777
They say I need
another X-ray.

01:11:32.851 --> 01:11:34.118
Hey.

01:11:35.571 --> 01:11:37.488
Hey, come on.

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:41.576
No tears. It's ok.

01:11:41.578 --> 01:11:45.379
Henry's safe.
It's all gonna be fine.

01:11:48.133 --> 01:11:50.051
Ask me again.

01:11:50.053 --> 01:11:52.053
What?

01:11:52.055 --> 01:11:54.038
Ask me.

01:11:59.878 --> 01:12:03.881
Jennifer Jareau,
will you marry me?

01:12:03.883 --> 01:12:06.601
Yeah.

01:12:06.603 --> 01:12:10.021
Oh, it's about damn time.

01:12:11.773 --> 01:12:13.557
There's a chaplain here.
Let's just do it now.

01:12:13.559 --> 01:12:15.059
Let's just get it
over with.

01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:17.912
Hell, no. I'm not the one
that's supposed to be in the gown.

01:12:17.914 --> 01:12:20.081
All right, fine.
Monday, then.

01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:22.355
Clear your calendar,
'cause we have a date

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.982
at the courthouse.

01:12:42.638 --> 01:12:45.389
The convention's still happening
tomorrow if you want to go.

01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:46.924
That whole city on the brink
of destruction thing

01:12:46.926 --> 01:12:48.943
kind of took the wind
out of my sails, you know?

01:12:48.945 --> 01:12:50.094
That'll do it every time.

01:12:50.096 --> 01:12:52.113
We didn't finish
the inspection.

01:12:52.115 --> 01:12:53.114
No need.

01:12:53.116 --> 01:12:54.565
What happened?

01:12:54.567 --> 01:12:58.102
Um, there is a horizontal
crack in the foundation.

01:12:58.104 --> 01:13:01.105
It just weakens the entire base
that the house is sitting on.

01:13:01.107 --> 01:13:02.490
Yeah. That does not
sound good.

01:13:02.492 --> 01:13:07.712
So, our unsub is Izzy Rogers.

01:13:07.714 --> 01:13:10.748
She'll be charged with
multiple counts domestically,

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:13.375
and our international
counterparts will have

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:14.019
their turn with her.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:15.970
She will never see
the light of day.

01:13:15.972 --> 01:13:17.805
I just thought
you'd like to know that.

01:13:17.807 --> 01:13:21.125
Agent Morgan, a word?

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:30.651
I, uh...

01:13:30.653 --> 01:13:33.304
I haven't had a chance
to speak with you.

01:13:33.306 --> 01:13:35.856
I sort of hit the ground
running.

01:13:38.643 --> 01:13:41.162
It took a lot of courage
to confront me

01:13:41.164 --> 01:13:43.414
about my drinking.

01:13:43.416 --> 01:13:45.816
You changed my life.

01:13:45.818 --> 01:13:47.752
Thank you.

01:13:47.754 --> 01:13:50.371
Honestly, ma'am,
that's not necessary.

01:13:50.373 --> 01:13:53.257
A simple "you're welcome"
would suffice.

01:13:53.259 --> 01:13:56.210
I'm just glad you're back.

01:13:56.212 --> 01:13:58.495
No, you're not.

01:13:58.497 --> 01:13:59.964
Hang on, let me check.

01:13:59.966 --> 01:14:01.665
Oh, wait, she's here.
Erin, don't go anywhere.

01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:03.851
Dave wants to know
if everyone is free tomorrow night?

01:14:03.853 --> 01:14:06.520
Well, it depends on
if he's buying. Then I'm definitely in.

01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:08.639
Yeah, me, too.

01:14:08.641 --> 01:14:10.358
You hear that? We're in.

01:14:11.526 --> 01:14:14.111
Emily, look, I know
you don't want to talk about it,

01:14:14.113 --> 01:14:16.513
but it's exactly why
we need to talk about it.

01:14:16.515 --> 01:14:18.949
This has nothing to do
with cracks in the foundation.

01:14:18.951 --> 01:14:22.119
No. But it's a sign.

01:14:22.121 --> 01:14:24.322
Oh, please don't get
all free spirit on me.

01:14:24.324 --> 01:14:28.209
I almost blew up
yesterday, twice.

01:14:28.211 --> 01:14:29.744
I know.

01:14:29.746 --> 01:14:32.029
That's about as grounded
as you can get.

01:14:32.031 --> 01:14:35.866
You want to leave,
don't you?

01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:37.134
I didn't say that.

01:14:37.136 --> 01:14:39.220
It's the only reason
you would be this quiet, Emily.

01:14:39.222 --> 01:14:42.723
Can we please
talk about this later?

01:14:42.725 --> 01:14:43.758
No.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.711
How long have you
been thinking about this?

01:14:47.713 --> 01:14:50.398
Honestly...

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.817
Since I got back.

01:14:54.903 --> 01:14:56.087
Really?

01:14:56.089 --> 01:14:59.223
It's not you guys.

01:14:59.225 --> 01:15:01.392
I love you.

01:15:01.394 --> 01:15:04.662
I just can't grab on
to my old life

01:15:04.664 --> 01:15:08.366
and pretend
that nothing happened.

01:15:08.368 --> 01:15:10.201
Is this about Easter?

01:15:10.203 --> 01:15:11.435
No.

01:15:12.337 --> 01:15:16.573
But he did ask me
to run the London office.

01:15:16.575 --> 01:15:17.925
And you're gonna do it.

01:15:17.927 --> 01:15:20.744
He just asked yesterday.

01:15:20.746 --> 01:15:22.380
But you're thinking
about it.

01:15:22.382 --> 01:15:23.347
I don't know yet.

01:15:23.349 --> 01:15:24.915
I--

01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:29.136
I thought buying a house
and putting down roots

01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:31.772
was gonna fix this feeling,

01:15:31.774 --> 01:15:35.726
it was gonna give me
what I wanted.

01:15:35.728 --> 01:15:38.145
But it hasn't.

01:15:39.614 --> 01:15:42.266
It's bigger than that.

01:15:44.069 --> 01:15:46.437
You think I should stay.

01:15:47.656 --> 01:15:50.925
I think I miss you already.

01:15:53.778 --> 01:15:55.496
What?

01:15:55.498 --> 01:15:57.798
Uh--uh--
I'll tell you later.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.051
I do not like the sound
of "I'll tell you later."

01:16:01.053 --> 01:16:03.954
It's JJ's night,
and I don't want to...

01:16:03.956 --> 01:16:05.473
All right,
if you are telling me

01:16:05.475 --> 01:16:06.974
that there is something
bad happening right now

01:16:06.976 --> 01:16:09.460
to balance out the goodness
that is tonight,

01:16:09.462 --> 01:16:12.396
I will have none of it,
because I don't believe in that.

01:16:12.398 --> 01:16:15.349
Although it's totally
one of the truths of life.

01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:18.018
Isn't it? The bitter
and the sweet mixed up together

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.687
in a cosmic soup that
we've all signed up for.

01:16:19.689 --> 01:16:20.938
Breathe. Breathe.
I think Kevin's here tonight.

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.858
It would make sense that
he would come tonight--

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.861
he's here.
He's here and he's with her,

01:16:26.863 --> 01:16:28.195
so I'm gonna go somewhere
which is not--

01:16:28.197 --> 01:16:29.363
mm--

01:16:29.365 --> 01:16:31.648
go somewhere that is not--
that is not here.

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:34.285
Hello. Hello. Hi.
Hi, Penelope.

01:16:34.287 --> 01:16:35.986
Hi.
Hello.

01:16:35.988 --> 01:16:37.671
Hello, Emily.

01:16:37.673 --> 01:16:39.173
Hi. It's nice
to see you again.

01:16:39.175 --> 01:16:40.674
Oh, it's nice to see you, too.
Hey, Derek.

01:16:40.676 --> 01:16:42.159
Hey, Beth.
What's up, Hotch?

01:16:42.161 --> 01:16:44.295
Oh, look out.
Look who it is.

01:16:44.297 --> 01:16:45.679
Little man Jack.
Give me some.

01:16:45.681 --> 01:16:47.131
Hey, guess what.

01:16:47.133 --> 01:16:49.300
They got a really cool
fountain right over there.

01:16:49.302 --> 01:16:50.851
You want to check it out
with me?

01:16:50.853 --> 01:16:51.852
Sure.

01:16:51.854 --> 01:16:53.504
I want to see, too.

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:55.506
All right, come.
Go. Go, go, go, go.

01:16:56.942 --> 01:16:58.008
How are you?

01:17:00.897 --> 01:17:02.279
That bad?

01:17:02.281 --> 01:17:03.581
What?

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:05.232
That's your tell.

01:17:05.234 --> 01:17:06.233
It is?

01:17:06.235 --> 01:17:07.251
Mm-hmm.

01:17:07.253 --> 01:17:08.652
For how long?

01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:11.188
Uh, every since
I've known you.

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:12.740
Oh.

01:17:12.742 --> 01:17:14.408
Well, you have one, too.

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:15.743
I do?

01:17:15.745 --> 01:17:18.078
Yeah. Only I'm not gonna
tell you what it is

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080
- Or you'll stop doing it.- I see.

01:17:20.082 --> 01:17:22.866
Do you want to talk about it?

01:17:22.868 --> 01:17:25.052
Absolutely.

01:17:26.204 --> 01:17:28.205
But not now.

01:17:28.207 --> 01:17:29.256
First thing tomorrow.

01:17:29.258 --> 01:17:30.874
It's a date.

01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:32.810
Ok.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.824
Wow.

01:17:46.826 --> 01:17:49.076
Hey.

01:17:49.078 --> 01:17:51.028
Someone knows
how to throw a party.

01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:52.229
You don't mess around.

01:17:52.231 --> 01:17:54.731
What can I tell you?
I'm the host with the most.

01:17:54.733 --> 01:17:56.450
No kidding.

01:17:56.452 --> 01:17:58.752
Hey, look who's here.

01:17:59.838 --> 01:18:01.071
Mom...

01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:05.926
Ok, what's--what's going on?

01:18:05.928 --> 01:18:08.462
Well, we couldn't get
married without your mama.

01:18:08.464 --> 01:18:12.683
I might have overheard
a little proposal yesterday.

01:18:12.685 --> 01:18:14.251
And I couldn't wait
till Monday.

01:18:14.253 --> 01:18:18.272
Ok, so this is why you guys
are so dressed up, huh?

01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:20.357
Yes. And you will be, too.

01:18:20.359 --> 01:18:23.193
I brought something borrowed.

01:18:23.195 --> 01:18:24.595
Mom, is that your dress?

01:18:24.597 --> 01:18:26.780
Yes.

01:18:26.782 --> 01:18:28.983
Let's go see
if it still fits.

01:18:28.985 --> 01:18:31.268
Ok.

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:32.903
Mom...

01:18:32.905 --> 01:18:35.489
So, nervous?

01:18:35.491 --> 01:18:38.208
Only if she doesn't
come back down.

01:19:53.568 --> 01:19:56.670
They s that good things
happen to good people.

01:19:56.672 --> 01:19:59.340
Today is one of those days,

01:19:59.342 --> 01:20:01.742
and these are
two of those people.

01:20:01.744 --> 01:20:03.477
We love you.

01:20:03.479 --> 01:20:04.445
Cheers.

01:20:04.447 --> 01:20:05.479
Cheers.
Cheers.
