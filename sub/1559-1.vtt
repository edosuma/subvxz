00:28.089 --> 00:30.141
Priority one is retrieval
of that package.

00:30.166 --> 00:32.018
Do not damage it or...

00:33.924 --> 00:36.487
or I will be very angry.

00:37.081 --> 00:39.870
- Prepare to breach.
- You can't breach without backup.

00:43.371 --> 00:46.517
You're telling me I need
permission, Hawkins?

00:47.011 --> 00:49.011
Is that what
you're telling me?

00:49.887 --> 00:51.196
Preparing to breach.

00:51.221 --> 00:53.279

02:56.404 --> 03:00.232
Teutonic knights recovered it from
Jerusalem during the Third Crusade.

03:01.107 --> 03:02.868
[Straining] It was stolen...

03:02.891 --> 03:05.627

03:08.661 --> 03:10.737
Forgotten after the war,

Locked in the original
magical safe.

03:18.532 --> 03:22.282
Which makes sense, as it
is dangerous and valuable.

03:22.297 --> 03:25.032
- Uh, dangerous?
- Flynn: And valuable.

03:25.057 --> 03:27.642
It summons demons, but
it doesn't control them.

Three minutes to disarm

No, no, no, no. For the death trap.
The bomb is actually much easier.

04:52.455 --> 04:54.658
Is it a black cylinder or
round like a soccer ball?

about The Library?

sends the invitations.

14:49.887 --> 14:51.621
Say hello to
Judson for me.

14:51.641 --> 14:54.890
Sayonara, arrivederci,
and goodbye.

14:54.915 --> 14:57.270
- I need an answer.
- This is my answer.

14:59.618 --> 15:02.267
Walking away quickly
is not an answer.

15:03.533 --> 15:04.726
How about this?

15:04.751 --> 15:05.948
[Doors slam]

15:07.160 --> 15:08.109
[Scoffs]

15:20.759 --> 15:22.087
[Gasps lightly]

15:23.762 --> 15:25.318
Well, if you won't tell
me what a guardian is,

15:25.341 --> 15:28.318
- point me to one of the
other Librarians. - Charlene!

15:28.338 --> 15:32.549
There are no other Librarians.
There is only ever one Librarian.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.596
And when he dies, another
takes his place.

15:35.614 --> 15:36.908
Good day.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.418
Was he the Librarian
before you?

15:43.460 --> 15:44.746
Judson? No.

15:45.558 --> 15:48.324
He was more than that.
He was, um...

15:48.339 --> 15:50.639
Well, he found me.
He trained me.

15:51.753 --> 15:55.033
He was there for me
when my mother...

15:56.319 --> 15:58.091
he died five years ago.

15:59.885 --> 16:01.372
Sorry.

16:01.397 --> 16:03.092
He's with us in spirit.

16:03.113 --> 16:04.495
- That's nice.
- Uh, no.

16:04.512 --> 16:07.078
Uh, literally in spirit.

16:07.085 --> 16:08.547
Nice reflexes.

16:09.117 --> 16:11.859
She will make a...
a good guardian.

16:12.482 --> 16:15.620
Hey, buy a guy
a drink first.

16:17.208 --> 16:19.096
You're... dead.

16:19.111 --> 16:20.637
It's easier than it looks.

16:20.662 --> 16:24.323
Um... uh, a guardian, f...
for your information,

16:24.344 --> 16:27.392
is the Librarian's
partner and bodyguard.

16:27.417 --> 16:31.722
You... you see, a life of fighting evil
cults and... and monsters, well...

16:31.737 --> 16:33.831
Librarians tend to die...

16:33.856 --> 16:36.206
Often, sometimes
even more than once.

16:36.231 --> 16:39.708
Flynn's survived 10 years, longer...
longer than anyone.

16:39.731 --> 16:41.270
Most of it without
a guardian, a...

16:41.286 --> 16:42.661
alone.

16:42.684 --> 16:45.036
It's... it's changed him.

16:46.090 --> 16:46.718
Ha!

16:46.743 --> 16:49.892
Um, this is...
this is too much.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.370
Magic is real?

16:51.384 --> 16:53.522
A... a building sent
me an envelope?

16:53.547 --> 16:56.547
I... I have a job.
I... I hunt terrorists.

16:56.570 --> 17:01.226
- I took an oath to protect innocent
people, to... to... - To be a guardian.

17:01.248 --> 17:08.029
N-Now you do the same job but in a world
with evils o-only you can face.

17:08.046 --> 17:12.849
There's only one ever guardian
in-in the whole world, Eve Baird,

17:12.873 --> 17:16.954
and The Library thinks
that it should be you.

17:17.568 --> 17:19.029
Do you mind?

17:20.243 --> 17:22.400
I'm trying to solve
a murder here.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.470
[Cracks]

17:31.499 --> 17:34.304
Well, you're doing a
pretty poor job of it.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.444
- Is that the foyer upstairs?
- It's "foy-eh."

17:36.468 --> 17:39.577
- So, you're saying this Dr. Jonas Sheir...
- It's "Shy-air."

17:39.600 --> 17:42.156
professor of
archaeology, five PhDs,

17:42.178 --> 17:44.706
was killed on your doorstep, and
you don't have a single lead?

17:44.715 --> 17:45.832
Oh, I've got
lots of leads.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.849
I've got a plethora of possibilities,
a cornucopia of clues.

17:48.874 --> 17:50.492
I just don't see how
they all connect.

17:50.517 --> 17:52.625
He was trying to show me
this when he was killed.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.984
It has something to
do with this crown.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.229
- What painting is that?
- I don't know.

17:56.252 --> 17:58.232
And that is what
is vexing me.

17:58.853 --> 17:59.533
[Laughs]

17:59.558 --> 18:00.770
I like that.

18:01.175 --> 18:05.144
Haven't used that word in a while.
Vex, vex, vexatious, vex, vex, vex.

18:05.162 --> 18:08.062
He was here. How did he know
about your secret library?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.294
Also vexing.

18:10.203 --> 18:12.271
It's one of the best-kept
secrets in the world.

18:12.736 --> 18:15.698
He was smart. He was
very, very smart, but...

18:15.713 --> 18:19.330
Is it possible you dropped one of your
special glowing envelopes by mistake?

18:19.355 --> 18:20.765
[Chuckles]

18:21.801 --> 18:22.824
No. Yes.

18:22.831 --> 18:25.411
No, not dropped... sent.
He was smart.

18:25.434 --> 18:29.330
He was very, very smart. Was he so
smart that you sent him an envelope?!

18:39.105 --> 18:42.423
- What are you looking for?
- The ledger, the ledger, the ledger.

18:42.448 --> 18:47.423
When the Librarian dies, The Library
doesn't just send out one letter.

18:47.446 --> 18:53.017
It sends out hundreds, hundreds to
qualified replacements all over the world.

18:53.042 --> 18:56.570
And it invites them
in for an interview.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.166
Many are called,
one is chosen.

18:58.191 --> 18:59.717
Precisely.

19:03.069 --> 19:05.342
And Professor Jonas Sheir,

19:05.349 --> 19:08.733
with his five PhDs, would
certainly have been qualified.

19:08.755 --> 19:10.503
We have to sign in.

19:13.877 --> 19:16.206
He said I wouldn't
remember him.

19:18.343 --> 19:20.004
He was here.

19:20.029 --> 19:21.341
He was here and
he signed in

19:21.356 --> 19:23.697
on the day that I was chosen to
be Librarian instead of him.

19:23.722 --> 19:25.668
And now he's dead.

19:26.783 --> 19:28.100
I know this name.

19:28.485 --> 19:30.068
- Dr. Abraham Thomas.
- Mm.

19:30.093 --> 19:33.124
Professor of physics, Doctor of
medicine, speaks four languages.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.540
I met Dr. Thomas at a NATO
conference on bioweapons.

19:35.564 --> 19:38.437
He died in a car
accident last month.

19:40.874 --> 19:41.978
[Sighs]

19:42.003 --> 19:43.977
Far Shariad,
Tehran University.

19:45.383 --> 19:46.352
Plane crash.

19:46.377 --> 19:48.080
Someone's killing
Librarians.

19:48.103 --> 19:52.768
Not all of them, just these
top-ranked top dozen or so.

19:52.791 --> 19:53.739
Dead.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.489
Dead.

19:55.770 --> 19:57.550
Disappeared...

19:58.181 --> 20:01.000
These three top-ranked candidates
don't pop death notices.

20:01.023 --> 20:02.836
They didn't come
in for interviews.

20:03.143 --> 20:04.418
Ezekiel Jones?

20:04.425 --> 20:06.704
Oh-ho! You got to
be kidding me!

20:07.085 --> 20:09.634
You sent an envelope
to Ezekiel Jones?

20:11.025 --> 20:13.408
Well, I guess he never
came in for an interview.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.931
Maybe they got dropped to the
bottom of the kill list.

20:15.956 --> 20:17.323
They could still be alive.

20:17.348 --> 20:19.641
First contact's address
is in New York.

20:20.198 --> 20:22.464
That's where I'm going.
Thank you for your help.

20:27.503 --> 20:29.534
- I was invited.
- Not by me.

20:33.909 --> 20:35.737
I don't need
your permission.

20:37.710 --> 20:40.173
Flynn: See, I really,
really work better alone.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.124
What Judson described...
a partner...

20:42.139 --> 20:44.319
- it's a sound operational structure.
- See, I've had partners before,

20:44.334 --> 20:47.419
and they've left or they've gone.
They're gone and they're dead.

20:47.428 --> 20:48.772
Or they're dead
and they're gone.

20:48.795 --> 20:52.201
But, if you'll excuse me, right now,
I need to find Cassandra Cillian.

20:52.226 --> 20:54.907
Female, early 20s, collapsed
at school, high fever.

20:54.922 --> 20:58.135
B.P... 140 over 90. Pulse...
100. Temp... 102.5.

20:58.150 --> 21:00.596
Sudden high fever, sore
joints, nausea, and vomiting.

21:00.611 --> 21:02.392
Doctor: Sensitivity to
light and stiff neck.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.999
Meningitis? Push a
wide-spectrum antibiotic.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.257
- Let's get a lumbar tap.
- Yes, Doctor.

21:06.274 --> 21:08.050
Cassandra: Pardon
me, but it's not.

21:08.075 --> 21:10.216
It's not meningitis.
It's psittacosis.

21:10.231 --> 21:12.133
The symptoms of psittacosis and
meningococcus are similar...

21:12.148 --> 21:13.484
for example, the
sensitivity to light...

21:13.500 --> 21:15.117
but you're ignoring
the other factors.

21:15.142 --> 21:16.306
The other factors.

21:16.330 --> 21:19.803
She's wearing a necklace that has parrot
feathers that she picked up off the ground.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.135
She could have
bought that!

21:21.160 --> 21:25.749
- Let's go. We're wasting time.
- No. It's homemade.

21:25.772 --> 21:27.063
The feathers fade.
In commercial feathers,

21:27.088 --> 21:30.330
they're preserved against sunlight
and ultraviolet light, ultraviolet--

21:30.353 --> 21:33.496
- Ultraviolet. 400 nanometers.
- She's right.

21:33.521 --> 21:38.505
914 different species of bird in North
America, and this doesn't match... ooh!

21:38.521 --> 21:40.500
That's an
African-parrot feather.

21:43.890 --> 21:46.974
You heard the janitor. Psittacosis,
parrot fever. Let's go!

21:46.996 --> 21:47.944
Cassandra: Radiation.

21:47.969 --> 21:50.618
Ultraviolet radiation.
Radiation.

21:51.468 --> 21:54.791
Radiation... the collision
of matter and antimatter.

21:58.507 --> 22:00.299
Paul Dirac mathematically
predicted the existence

22:00.322 --> 22:04.487
of positrons with a mass
of 9.110(-31) Kilograms,

22:04.510 --> 22:10.468
protons with a mass of 1.67262178
times negative 27... kilograms.

22:10.483 --> 22:12.600
Neutrons with a mass of...

22:14.999 --> 22:16.409
Cassandra Cillian?

22:16.725 --> 22:19.533
I'm sorry. It'll
stop in a second.

22:20.858 --> 22:21.874
[Chuckles lightly]

22:21.898 --> 22:23.898
I smell peanuts this time.

22:23.922 --> 22:24.875
That's not bad.

22:24.890 --> 22:28.628
Wow. Auditory and sensory hallucinations
linked to memory retrieval.

22:29.724 --> 22:32.482
- You're a synesthete.
- Wow. Yes.

22:33.099 --> 22:34.615
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:34.634 --> 22:36.505
She has a
photographic memory.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.579
Like mine.

22:37.604 --> 22:38.765
Only her brain
is cross-wired.

22:38.772 --> 22:40.766
All five senses are
linked to her memory.

22:40.791 --> 22:41.655
Unbelievable.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.520
I was about to be
super-pissed at you

22:43.534 --> 22:45.354
for assuming I don't know
what a synesthete is,

22:45.361 --> 22:48.463
but I actually don't know
what a synesthete is.

22:48.470 --> 22:53.035
Numbers are colors. Science is musical
notes. When I do math, I smell things.

22:53.517 --> 22:56.091
- Mostly breakfast.
- You're in a lot of danger.

22:56.658 --> 22:58.306
You need to come with us.

22:58.324 --> 23:00.394
- Are you the police?
- No.

23:01.018 --> 23:02.428
I'm the Librarian.

23:05.129 --> 23:06.692
Go get your coat.

23:08.970 --> 23:12.217
Okay, two left, but on
opposite sides of the world.

23:12.232 --> 23:13.403
If somebody's hunting
these people,

23:13.425 --> 23:15.431
you're risking their lives
by not accepting my help.

23:15.456 --> 23:17.847
- You need me.
- Okay.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.313
If I can't get rid of you,
I will make use of you.

23:20.338 --> 23:21.979
So why don't we
both take one.

23:21.988 --> 23:25.050
Here... no, actually,
I will take Mr. Jones.

23:25.075 --> 23:26.521
Good luck to
you out there.

23:26.546 --> 23:27.911
Get ready for anything.

23:27.936 --> 23:30.489
- Define "anything."
- Oh, ninjas, possibly.

23:30.514 --> 23:31.955
Ninjas?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.058

24:26.055 --> 24:27.843
Aah!

24:30.008 --> 24:31.596
[British accent] Why is that
guard holding a dagger?

24:31.607 --> 24:33.986
He's not a guard. He's
here to kill you.

24:34.011 --> 24:35.606
Ezekiel Jones.

24:36.837 --> 24:39.446
And I'm assuming you're
not here to kill me.

24:39.463 --> 24:41.678
So, tell you what.

24:41.703 --> 24:44.490
Watch my back for 10 minutes,
and I'll cut you in on 10%.

24:44.515 --> 24:45.985
[Chuckles]

24:47.364 --> 24:49.503
You... don't I know you?

24:49.517 --> 24:53.208
Yeah. Cairo Museum. You were that crazy
professor who said the crown jewels

24:53.230 --> 24:55.589
- of Amenhotep were cursed.
- Librarian, not Professor, but yeah.

24:55.603 --> 24:57.205
I stole those jewels right
out of the main exhibit.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.738
Oh, I know. I'm the one who
had to smite the evil mummy.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.387
And now you're going to
steal this jeweled dagger.

25:02.410 --> 25:05.637
Oh. No, no, no. It's mine.

25:05.660 --> 25:08.192
I just left it locked in this display
case on my way to work this morning.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.303
You know how that happens.

You're smart enough
to be my sidekick.

25:12.896 --> 25:15.775
We'll call you... "Kid Crime." You
can wear little green shorts.

Burning through the glass in
a room full of infrared sensors...

- What do you want, mate?
- Come to New York,

25:32.578 --> 25:34.337
find out why people are
trying to kill you.

25:34.352 --> 25:35.730

- Working the pipeline Sunday?
- Yes, sir, I am.

26:11.584 --> 26:12.807
I got about an
hour after church,

26:12.814 --> 26:14.266
so I'm gonna run down
there to that junkyard,

that '68 gearbox.

26:25.982 --> 26:29.047
- She ain't from around here.
- No, she is not.

26:32.277 --> 26:33.871
She's from somewhere...

26:34.903 --> 26:36.519
Interesting.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.687
Gentlemen.

26:41.453 --> 26:43.877
Time for the master
to go to work.

26:46.432 --> 26:48.158
Idiot.

26:49.761 --> 26:51.761
How's your daddy?

26:53.168 --> 26:56.385
Too drunk to work,
he's too stubborn to die.

27:06.239 --> 27:08.746
- That was quick.
- She's crazy.

27:08.771 --> 27:10.154
She's crazy?

27:10.179 --> 27:11.546
Why, 'cause she wouldn't
leave with you?

27:11.571 --> 27:14.111
Hell, half our high
school must be insane.

27:14.604 --> 27:19.000
She won't even talk to you unless
you an explain that weird tattoo.

27:25.934 --> 27:27.150
Excuse me.

27:35.765 --> 27:36.774
Hey.

27:38.191 --> 27:40.332
That's a nice tattoo
you got there.

27:41.799 --> 27:43.667
[British accent]
Tell you what, cowboy.

27:44.252 --> 27:46.610
Tell me what it means,

27:46.635 --> 27:48.568
and I'll let you
buy me a drink.

27:51.095 --> 27:53.860
Well, it looks like you got
some foreign words there.

27:53.885 --> 27:55.237
That I-talian?

27:55.252 --> 27:56.477

28:11.688 --> 28:14.194
"And the blood-dimmed
tide is loosed,

28:15.090 --> 28:18.068
and everywhere, the ceremony
of innocence is drowned."

28:19.111 --> 28:23.575
It's Yeats, "the second coming."
It's his poem about the apocalypse.

28:24.263 --> 28:25.780
Tell me... what's a pretty
little thing like you

28:25.796 --> 28:28.251
doing running around with the
end of the world on her arm?

28:29.592 --> 28:31.646
- I'm Lamia.
- Hi.

And you must be

I'm not...

- Sorry, no.

- Ninjas, possibly?

- That's what I said.

29:21.491 --> 29:23.210
Not bad for an amateur.

There ain't nothing amateur about
my bar fights, sweetheart.

29:28.565 --> 29:30.362

Oh, man. I'm gonna
miss that hat.

29:43.586 --> 29:45.826
You mind telling me what
that was all about?

29:46.297 --> 29:49.186
You were targeted because
of your expertise.

29:49.201 --> 29:51.117
My expertise? [Chuckles]

29:51.142 --> 29:53.753
Y'all think they're out there
killing oil riggers with ninjas?

29:53.762 --> 29:56.598
- Y'all got another...
- Jacob Stone... I.Q. 190.

and Cambridge for an arts degree...

Over the past 20 years,
under a pseudonym,

30:02.817 --> 30:04.225
you've secretly been
writing literature

30:04.247 --> 30:06.833
on European and Native
American art history,

all while working on an oil rig 5 miles
from the town where you grew up...

30:11.758 --> 30:13.197
Y'all.

30:16.837 --> 30:21.074
I don't get why I'm stuck here
with a cowboy and a maid.

30:22.597 --> 30:24.597
You might want to apologize
to the little lady.

30:24.622 --> 30:28.013
Little lady actually not
an improvement over maid.

You got to be kidding me.

30:58.983 --> 31:00.684
Not kidding. But we don't
have a lot of time.

31:00.709 --> 31:03.200
So, questions... ask them.

31:05.837 --> 31:08.797
- Is that the Spear of Destiny?
- Yes.

31:10.945 --> 31:12.050
Ark of the covenant?

31:12.075 --> 31:13.827
- Yes.
- Wait. What about Bigfoot and Dracula?

31:13.835 --> 31:14.610
Yes and no.

31:14.633 --> 31:17.013
- Yes on Bigfoot.
- So, vampires aren't real?

31:17.038 --> 31:21.710
Vampires are real, but Dracula
is not, because I killed him.

31:21.733 --> 31:24.015
Is this helping?
I don't know that it is.

31:24.522 --> 31:25.889
What?!

31:25.914 --> 31:28.023
Baird: 10 years ago, each
of you received an envelope

31:28.031 --> 31:31.664
inviting you to apply for a position here
in this library, but you never showed.

31:31.686 --> 31:33.501
10 years ago, I was
in a hospital.

31:33.526 --> 31:35.315
Right, with your tumor.
[Inhales sharply]

31:36.291 --> 31:37.233
Um...

31:37.723 --> 31:40.271
Synesthetes rarely have
all five senses involved.

31:40.287 --> 31:43.233
You've got full-on
hallucinations and seizures,

31:43.240 --> 31:46.727
indicative of a frontal-lobe
anomaly, oligodendroglioma.

31:47.685 --> 31:50.552
How big is it?

31:52.771 --> 31:54.557
It's about the
size of a grape.

31:55.616 --> 31:58.572
Which I really wish they hadn't told me,
'cause I used to really like grapes.

31:59.771 --> 32:01.211
- Are you...
- Not yet.

32:02.631 --> 32:06.873
Someday. Sooner than
I'd like, but not yet.

32:09.409 --> 32:12.110
But I lived long enough to
learn that magic exists.

32:12.135 --> 32:15.838
- So, that's pretty cool.
- Very cool.

32:15.853 --> 32:17.598
Stone, why didn't
you show up?

32:17.623 --> 32:20.654
'Cause I already had a
job, family business.

32:20.673 --> 32:21.899
I threw mine out.

32:22.643 --> 32:23.302
[Laughs]

32:23.327 --> 32:25.533
It was obviously
a mistake.

32:25.558 --> 32:27.597
I steal stuff. I've been stealing
stuff since I was a kid.

32:27.604 --> 32:29.683
I'm not gonna get invited
to work at a library.

32:29.706 --> 32:30.906
It is a magic library.

32:30.931 --> 32:32.779
Eh, great. It doesn't
fill my pocket.

32:33.259 --> 32:35.491
I came here to find out
who's trying to kill me.

32:35.516 --> 32:38.009
If magic's real, how come we
don't see it all the time?

32:38.991 --> 32:41.290
Once upon a time,

32:41.315 --> 32:44.027
the world was
filled with magic.

32:44.052 --> 32:47.671
It traveled along a power
network called Ley Lines.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.985
See the Ley Lines,
see the magic.

32:53.817 --> 32:58.193
Over the centuries, the magic was
drained off and stored into artifacts.

32:58.218 --> 32:59.098
Baird: Like Excalibur.

32:59.123 --> 33:01.198
Exactly. He was one
of the most powerful.

33:01.223 --> 33:02.105
He?

33:02.130 --> 33:05.596
The magic continued to fade as cities
were constructed over the Ley Lines

33:05.611 --> 33:07.022
and technology
began to advance.

33:07.047 --> 33:09.893
And, as you can see now, there's
very little magic left.

33:09.915 --> 33:14.892
My job is to make sure that what remains
doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

33:17.818 --> 33:19.986
Like the people who tried
to kill the three of you.

33:20.864 --> 33:23.866
The woman who tried to kill
Stone had a snake tattoo.

33:27.329 --> 33:28.852
Serpent Brotherhood...

33:28.876 --> 33:31.726
an ancient cult bent on bringing
magic back into the world.

33:31.751 --> 33:32.844
I've fought them before.

33:32.869 --> 33:37.018
So these serpent ninja brotherhood fellas
are the ones that are trying to kill us?

33:37.043 --> 33:38.843
The Serpent Brotherhood
use assassins.

33:38.857 --> 33:39.539
[Laughs]

33:39.564 --> 33:40.963
Ninjas?

33:40.982 --> 33:43.758
Who said ninjas? In Oklahoma?
That would be ridiculous.

33:46.413 --> 33:49.624
What did Professor Sheir find that
pushed the Brotherhood to kill him,

33:49.639 --> 33:52.975
- then murder their way down the list?
- Still vexing.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.158
Stone: Does it have anything
to do with this painting?

33:57.183 --> 33:59.148
- "Crown of King Arthur"?
- What?!

34:01.586 --> 34:02.870
[Laughs]

34:04.226 --> 34:06.208
Crown of King Arthur?
You sure?

34:07.033 --> 34:07.831
Yeah.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.184
Crown of King Arthur
was forged by Merlin

34:10.208 --> 34:13.145
to give Arthur control over the magic
that he needed to build Camelot.

34:13.168 --> 34:15.347
So the Brotherhood wants
to bring magic back,

34:15.362 --> 34:17.942
but they need the
crown to control it.

34:18.386 --> 34:20.717
Cannot believe I just said
that with a straight face.

34:21.103 --> 34:24.487
Um, why is bringing
magic back bad?

34:24.511 --> 34:26.167
'Cause magic seems
pretty cool.

34:26.188 --> 34:30.538
Magic is cool, till warring nations drown
each other in tidal waves of blood

34:30.553 --> 34:32.213
or use dragons to burn
cities to the ground.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.676
Magic used well
can be good,

34:33.697 --> 34:38.375
but a world of wild magic is
full of chaos and suffering.

34:39.149 --> 34:41.047
I will begin by exa...

34:43.088 --> 34:45.846
I will begin by examining
the original painting.

34:45.864 --> 34:47.790
Stone: Well, I just
said that I remember

34:47.806 --> 34:49.491
that it was called
"The Crown of King Arthur."

34:49.498 --> 34:52.295
It's a minor piece. Unknown artist.
I don't know where that thing's at.

Oh, I cased it last month for
a heist, memorized the inventory.

34:57.526 --> 34:58.878
There's a flight
to Munich,

34:58.903 --> 35:03.896
Three flights to Munich out of JFK,
one at 6:00, one at 7:15, and 10:45.

35:05.582 --> 35:07.582
Baird: That's why
they were targeted.

35:07.597 --> 35:10.089

whatever Librarians do.

35:11.521 --> 35:13.248

35:13.272 --> 35:15.170
Not Librarians. I'm
the only Librarian.

35:15.194 --> 35:16.694
...were the people most
likely to find the crown.

35:16.717 --> 35:19.786
The Brotherhood was just trying
to wipe out the competition.

35:19.811 --> 35:22.022
- I say we beat them to it.
- Fair enough.

Ezekiel Jones in the back.

35:24.441 --> 35:28.410
- I've never been to Europe, so...
- Uh, first of all, no.

35:28.426 --> 35:31.332
Second of all, let's not refer
to ourselves in the third person.

35:31.354 --> 35:35.116
Europe is overrated. And I work alone.
So, if you'll excuse me...

35:36.055 --> 35:38.314
- Goodbye.
- Unh-unh.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.525
I got an envelope.

35:40.548 --> 35:43.531
The Library invited me to this party,
and I'm taking them to Munich.

35:43.554 --> 35:46.214
Maybe we'll see you there.
Do try to keep up.

Ezekiel: So, why are we looking for
a Brit's crown in a German museum?

36:39.676 --> 36:42.473
Well, historically Camelot
fell to the goth invaders,

36:42.498 --> 36:46.537
so they could have taken the crown
back to Ancient Germania, hidden it,

36:46.562 --> 36:49.602
and they left clues in
the cultural artifacts

36:49.627 --> 36:52.192
I think I heard one
night on the radio.

Yes, ma'am.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.447
The Crown of King Arthur.
Artist unknown.

37:40.462 --> 37:46.497
Painted in 1146. Installed as one of
the original pieces in this museum in 1546.

on the knights.

37:49.414 --> 37:50.592

37:50.617 --> 37:53.088
Arthur's wearing the equipment
of a Roman legionnaire.

37:53.113 --> 37:55.222
It's the Roman hypothesis.

37:55.716 --> 37:57.569
The theory is that when
the Roman Empire fell,

37:57.594 --> 38:00.024
the Roman legion stationed
in Britain stayed behind.

38:00.039 --> 38:01.877
Camelot as a city,

38:01.902 --> 38:04.595
armored warriors, legionnaires.
It all fits.

38:04.620 --> 38:05.901
Together: Arthur was a Roman.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.059
Yeah.

it's a dye.

It's called carmine.

38:33.029 --> 38:35.007
It was discovered
in like the 1500s.

38:35.014 --> 38:38.631
- Painting can't be as early as 1100.
- Also odd... it can't be moved.

This frame's anchored
into the beam.

38:42.997 --> 38:46.610
There's a binary code engraved into
the frame that you can't move.

38:46.635 --> 38:48.675
Who cares? That's not... the point
is, is that this is a...

39:03.090 --> 39:05.658
Because it's meant as
a message, not art.

39:05.683 --> 39:07.207
And it's in a frame
that can't be moved,

39:07.216 --> 39:10.777
which means that the frame's location
in this museum is important.

39:10.802 --> 39:13.582
- And it has a code in it.
- A coordinate code,

39:13.607 --> 39:16.207
leading you... somewhere.

39:16.232 --> 39:17.928
But it requires a key,

39:18.738 --> 39:22.123
- some sort of reference point.
- Like a fixed point in space.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.781
Like a painting that
can't be moved.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.177
The entire museum
is the key.

39:27.202 --> 39:31.093
The dimensions of the floors,
the rooms in the museum

39:31.116 --> 39:32.942
as they relate to where
the painting is.

39:33.666 --> 39:36.269
- That's the key to the code.
- Leading where?

39:37.752 --> 39:38.946
Let's find out.

39:42.936 --> 39:44.178
[Grunting]

40:01.131 --> 40:02.709
There!

40:16.529 --> 40:17.982
Flynn: Latin.

40:17.998 --> 40:24.028
"The crown of the Celts lies 70
leagues to the great woods."

40:24.042 --> 40:26.707
And then there's some
coordinates. This means...

40:26.730 --> 40:28.746
The crown of King
Arthur is real.

40:28.755 --> 40:30.688
And it's buried in
the black forest.

40:31.249 --> 40:32.899
Well, where have you been?

40:33.242 --> 40:35.680
Some very exciting
stuff's going on here.

40:36.648 --> 40:37.867
[Sighs]

40:46.406 --> 40:47.976
Whoa!

40:50.506 --> 40:51.728
We're close.

40:53.347 --> 40:54.660
We can walk from here.

40:54.679 --> 40:59.375
Okay, I think, first, maybe we should
probably just stop and snack and hydrate.

40:59.399 --> 41:01.704
I packed some sandwiches
and some cucumbers

41:01.728 --> 41:03.869
and crackers and some
delicious prosciutto.

41:03.886 --> 41:05.761
People are trying to kill us,
and you brought a picnic.

41:05.782 --> 41:08.113
Hey. We're on
an adventure,

41:08.136 --> 41:10.343
traveling down bad roads
in a crappy truck.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.977
This sure beats
my day job...

41:12.913 --> 41:15.038
Of traveling down bad
roads in a crappy truck.

41:15.059 --> 41:19.086
[Helicopter

41:19.560 --> 41:21.204
The Serpent Brotherhood.

41:21.404 --> 41:23.033
- They have a helicopter.
- Yeah.

41:23.058 --> 41:24.592
Why don't we have
a helicopter?

41:24.932 --> 41:27.634
Because we have a Charlene, who
approved a budget for one rental car.

41:27.659 --> 41:30.659
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
We still have the advantage,

41:30.683 --> 41:32.735
because all the clues for
the crown's location

41:32.760 --> 41:34.669
will be down here
on ground level.

41:34.687 --> 41:36.840
They have a helicopter
and are trained killers.

41:36.864 --> 41:39.803
You and I have very different
definitions of "advantage."

41:41.912 --> 41:44.266
[Cellphone rings]

41:46.930 --> 41:48.024
Sir.

41:48.048 --> 41:53.445
Lamia, centuries of planning depend on
you outrunning one half-mad Librarian,

41:53.460 --> 41:57.225
his part-time bodyguard,
and their amateur sidekicks.

41:57.246 --> 41:59.668
You can understand
my frustration.

42:00.475 --> 42:03.053
We had some issues
at the museum.

42:03.072 --> 42:05.298
Get the crown, kill
whom you must.

42:05.749 --> 42:08.394
But understand...
without the crown,

42:08.417 --> 42:11.405
it will take us 100 years
to remake the world.

42:11.429 --> 42:14.004
With the crown, we can
do it in a single night.

42:21.577 --> 42:23.953
Good job... by the way.

42:24.688 --> 42:26.091
At the museum.

42:27.109 --> 42:28.416
[Chuckles lightly]

42:28.895 --> 42:32.323
If you think about it, we
kind of have the same job.

42:32.348 --> 42:36.155
Running around the world,
finding dangerous objects.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.321
Yes.

42:38.251 --> 42:42.717
It's important work, which is
why I need to stay focused.

42:42.742 --> 42:43.711
I get that.

42:43.735 --> 42:47.346
The whole time I'm home, I'm
just thinking about my next job.

42:48.211 --> 42:49.590
Exactly.

42:49.615 --> 42:51.559
- I don't need friends and
family cluttering up my life. - Yes.

42:51.584 --> 42:54.082
- I get so sick of my friends...
- [Chuckles]

42:54.107 --> 42:56.356
and... and family.

42:56.379 --> 42:58.312
- That's funny.
- Hey, um,

42:58.852 --> 43:00.477
for what it's worth,

43:01.282 --> 43:05.580
you're not nearly as weird
as I thought you were in Berlin.

43:07.687 --> 43:10.121
Well, I think
you are, um...

henge.

43:15.822 --> 43:17.183
Henge.

43:17.201 --> 43:19.785
I'm henge. Cool.

Oh-ho. Oh. Oh. Oh!

43:28.909 --> 43:30.466
A henge!

43:31.597 --> 43:33.886
This is unheard of in
this part of the world.

43:35.321 --> 43:38.860
This is the second clue to the
burial place of the crown.

43:41.735 --> 43:46.984
[Helicopter
blades whirring]

43:48.459 --> 43:52.037
You solve this. I'll go stall them.
I'm your guardian... for now.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.570
You're not my guardian.

43:54.116 --> 43:55.201
Take Ezekiel with you.

43:55.226 --> 43:57.202
Wait, wait, what?
Because I'm expendable?

43:57.227 --> 44:02.092
Well, for ancient astronomical puzzles,
I need a historian, I need a scientist.

44:02.117 --> 44:04.862
- But...
- And you're a little expendable.

44:07.908 --> 44:10.650
They'll be spread out in pairs,
so we have some room to move.

44:10.675 --> 44:12.832
Yeah, I've slipped past police
in 20 different countries.

44:12.857 --> 44:15.709
- I think I know what I'm doing.
- Yeah, I know. I've read your FBI file.

44:15.734 --> 44:18.213
Yeah, criminals do
tend to get those.

44:18.541 --> 44:20.760
No, your other one.

"When the sun passes through, upon
the fourth day after solstice"...

44:36.788 --> 44:38.234
It's like Stonehenge.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.762
The light only comes
through certain openings,

44:40.787 --> 44:42.961
certain hours,
on certain days.

44:43.515 --> 44:45.808
In fact, there's only one day
a year where you can read it.

44:47.295 --> 44:49.080
And that day...

44:49.747 --> 44:50.654
is not today.

44:50.676 --> 44:52.940
Maybe we can re-create
the sun's path.

44:52.965 --> 44:56.004
Well, over several days, months apart,
I could triangulate each position.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.573
[Straining] I can do that math.

me a while.

take me a while.

Where are we?

45:05.896 --> 45:07.869
In the black forest.

45:07.893 --> 45:13.291
No. She means 84.3 degrees
north, 18.5 degrees east.

45:13.315 --> 45:15.868
At solstice, light
is 52.5 degrees.

45:18.622 --> 45:20.142
Sun's on the ecliptic...

45:20.639 --> 45:23.139
23.5 degrees off the
celestial equator.

45:23.158 --> 45:24.427
Equator, equator.

45:24.452 --> 45:27.782
Solstice degrees add latitude,
then subtract 1 degree a day.

45:27.807 --> 45:29.480

45:30.167 --> 45:32.019
To find it...

Yes.

48.5 degrees...

45:36.802 --> 45:38.828

high is that rock?

- About 9 feet.
- 9 feet. 3 meters.

45:51.970 --> 45:53.549
It's Venus beneath
the harvest moon.

45:53.573 --> 45:56.171
Venus' transgression across
the sky at this latitude.

45:57.089 --> 45:59.117
It's on a 15-degree arc.

45:59.142 --> 46:02.220

would be a late-October festival.

from the sun in summer.

All right? Now I may have a trick.

Listen, listen. All right?

46:53.479 --> 46:56.190
Now, your sensations
need a context.

All right, one place where you
remember smelling the oranges,

46:58.797 --> 47:00.915
a strong memory, something
stronger than a smell.

47:00.936 --> 47:02.839
- It's breakfast.
- Okay.

47:03.626 --> 47:05.617
Breakfast. I'm... 12.

All right. Go right there.
Lock in on that.

My dad's doing the bills, and I balanced
the checkbook in my head.

47:17.434 --> 47:18.957
He's so proud of me.

47:19.861 --> 47:21.533
They're both so
proud of me.

47:25.525 --> 47:27.525
How'd you do that?

47:27.550 --> 47:29.550
It was Bachiani.

Italian artist in the 1800s.

He was a synesthete, and he might have
mentioned that little trick in his memoirs.

I think that was the last
time they were proud of me.

one of those, did you?

- Oh.

need to draw them back here.

Most people would use
metal, like magnesium,

but a high-protein
meat, like prosciutto,

48:47.635 --> 48:50.494
stuffed into a cucumber
works just as well.

better, but...

of King Arthur.

- Shotgun! - This job seems
to involve an awful lot of running!

Oh, you get used to it.

51:00.815 --> 51:03.518
Okay, let's go. And go.

51:11.088 --> 51:12.361
Not bad for their first...

51:12.377 --> 51:14.272
- Only...
- time out.

51:16.285 --> 51:17.987
What did you do on
your first time out?

51:18.006 --> 51:20.115
I recovered the
spear of destiny

51:20.140 --> 51:23.590
and stopped an extradimensional pyramid
power from taking over the world.

Now you're just
showing off.

51:28.162 --> 51:29.935
It is a very nice crown.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.960
Well, done and done.

51:32.516 --> 51:35.517
Now, it's time to see about
sending you good people home.

51:39.071 --> 51:41.191
If that's what's
appropriate.

51:43.762 --> 51:46.925
I think Col. Baird is
going to be sticking around.

51:47.402 --> 51:50.644
But if she thinks she's getting the same
benefit package she got in the army--

was ready to move on.

51:59.839 --> 52:01.793
Oh, well...

52:01.818 --> 52:03.576
I'll just have
a talk with him.

52:03.601 --> 52:06.476
After all, who's in charge?
I am. Not him.

52:07.415 --> 52:09.479
Just because he's dead...

52:14.941 --> 52:16.777
Well, this has been great.

52:16.802 --> 52:19.190
But I gotta get
back to my job.

52:19.215 --> 52:20.551
Your job?

52:20.576 --> 52:23.006
Digging? Like, actually
digging holes?

52:23.031 --> 52:24.320
I have responsibilities.

52:24.345 --> 52:25.939
A man has to have dreams.

52:26.784 --> 52:29.518
But a man's reach should
exceed his grasp, or

52:29.543 --> 52:31.543
what's a heaven for?

52:32.107 --> 52:33.662
That's why I always
reach for the impossible.

52:33.687 --> 52:35.929
You mean that's why you always
reach for other people's stuff.

52:35.954 --> 52:38.126
Hey, it's great you
love digging holes.

52:38.151 --> 52:41.096
I've one talent in this
world, that's stealing.

52:41.567 --> 52:43.630
Not proud it's the only
thing I'm good at,

52:43.655 --> 52:45.655
But I'm damn proud
I'm good at it.

52:45.976 --> 52:49.903
Very noble profession, which I am
excited to see you employ elsewhere.

52:49.928 --> 52:51.288
Flynn?

52:51.313 --> 52:52.996
How did you become
a Librarian?

52:53.018 --> 52:55.769
Uh, the previous
Librarian...

52:55.794 --> 52:56.823
died.

52:56.848 --> 53:00.455
So, if we're the
last candidates,

53:01.177 --> 53:04.138
does one of us become the
Librarian if you die?

53:04.163 --> 53:06.001
[Laughs]

53:10.088 --> 53:13.516
Well, if it's Ezekiel, I'm gonna shoot
him and hope someone better pops up.

53:13.911 --> 53:15.447
[Alarm buzzing]

53:16.118 --> 53:17.758
It's the perimeter alarm.

53:17.773 --> 53:20.299
Installed a new security system
after the last break-in.

53:20.314 --> 53:21.821
Baird: How long till they
get past the elevators?

53:21.835 --> 53:24.438
Well, it's not just a secret door.
It's an actual magical portal.

53:24.463 --> 53:28.184
There's no way that they can breach it,
unless you disable it from the inside.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.051
Somebody let them in?!

53:36.548 --> 53:38.170
Find the crown.

53:41.486 --> 53:42.628
The crown.

53:42.949 --> 53:44.967
Okay, everybody split up.
Find Charlene.

53:44.992 --> 53:46.786
I'm going after the crown.

53:46.794 --> 53:49.140
- I'm with you.
- I got my own backup!

53:49.158 --> 53:50.524
'Cal, come!

54:00.009 --> 54:01.401
Is that a flying sword?

54:01.418 --> 54:03.097
- Excalibur.
- Ezekiel: Of course it is.

54:03.122 --> 54:04.770
Come on, old friend.
Can't argue with that.

54:04.789 --> 54:06.859
- Let's go.
- He's got a flying sword.

54:09.524 --> 54:11.196
Miss Charlene?

54:12.985 --> 54:14.458
Hello?

54:16.161 --> 54:17.404
What are you doing,
you following me?

54:17.429 --> 54:20.524
Well, this place isn't exactly well
mapped out, and I heard your voice--

54:21.610 --> 54:22.682
Whoa.

54:22.707 --> 54:24.793
Who disabled
The Library security?

54:24.810 --> 54:28.354
Hmm? 'cause we've got one guy
that's good at opening locks

54:28.379 --> 54:30.293
and, like you said, well,
you're pretty damn good at it.

54:30.318 --> 54:32.278
What about you, mate?

54:32.301 --> 54:33.903
Stuck in a dead end job,
making little money.

54:39.555 --> 54:41.147
There they are!

54:54.251 --> 54:55.695
Don't worry, Cassandra.

54:58.933 --> 55:01.081
I was hoping
for a rematch.

55:02.036 --> 55:04.190
Well, I brought a
sword this time.

55:05.323 --> 55:07.401
- For what it's worth, I believe you now.
- Why's that?

55:07.426 --> 55:09.942
- 'Cause they're trying to kill you, too.
- That's a comfort.

55:12.036 --> 55:15.055
Let her go, Lamia. She's no threat to you.
She's not even a Librarian.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.430
Let her go, and I'll give you back...
The...

55:19.144 --> 55:20.282
Crown.

55:21.644 --> 55:22.957
Cassandra.

55:23.784 --> 55:25.675
They said they
could save me.

55:26.195 --> 55:29.954
- That only magic can save me.
- They're the Serpent Brotherhood.

55:31.364 --> 55:33.258
Serpents lie.

55:34.827 --> 55:35.902
Aah!

55:44.710 --> 55:46.143
The Library has
been breached.

55:46.158 --> 55:47.791
The Serpent Brotherhood
is everywhere.

55:47.805 --> 55:51.795
No one comes into my library
without my permission.

55:53.612 --> 55:55.198
Do it.

55:55.218 --> 55:58.392
The Li... Library's
gotten very big.

55:59.401 --> 56:02.529
It's, uh... it's going
to take both of us.

56:03.380 --> 56:04.560
I know.

56:06.527 --> 56:08.978
Oh, he'll never
save his receipts.

56:09.965 --> 56:14.660
Lamia: Merlin forged this crown so that
Arthur could control his weapons of power.

56:14.684 --> 56:16.629
And the greatest
of all weapons...

56:16.651 --> 56:18.167
a magic sword...

56:18.607 --> 56:20.641
Excalibur!

56:24.104 --> 56:25.474
'Cal, no!

56:25.499 --> 56:26.900
'Cal, come!

56:27.969 --> 56:31.353
You're powerful,
more than you know...

56:34.552 --> 56:36.284
but not that powerful.

56:37.343 --> 56:38.574
Aah!

56:49.373 --> 56:50.879
Flynn!

56:55.723 --> 56:57.378
Tell Dulaque we
have the key.

56:57.386 --> 56:59.923
We'll open the lock, and magic
will return to the world.

57:00.304 --> 57:02.527
[Gasping]

57:03.272 --> 57:04.561
First...

57:05.218 --> 57:06.488
kill the Librarian.

57:06.506 --> 57:07.782
Man: Yes, ma'am.

57:07.996 --> 57:09.091
