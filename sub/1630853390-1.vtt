04:34.008 --> 04:36.878

04:40.715 --> 04:45.485
<i>And I was staring...</i>
<i>I couldn't help it.</i>

04:46.954 --> 04:53.995
<i>And then he looked at me...</i>
<i>with just one look.</i>

04:54.028 --> 04:58.232
<i>And I followed,</i>
<i>like I was tethered to him.</i>

04:58.266 --> 05:01.502
<i>Like he had hypnotized me.</i>

05:04.839 --> 05:10.545
<i>It was a single bathroom,</i>

05:12.914 --> 05:18.385
<i>Once I walked in,</i>
<i>we grabbed each other,</i>

05:20.487 --> 05:25.593

05:35.335 --> 05:38.105
<i>When he was done,</i>
<i>he kissed me.</i>

05:38.139 --> 05:44.245
<i>I was still shivering</i>
<i>and then he left the bathroom.</i>

05:44.278 --> 05:47.982
<i>So, I got myself together</i>
<i>and I went back to the bar.</i>

05:49.517 --> 05:51.786
And he was still there
with his friends.

05:55.623 --> 05:59.560
And he smiled at me
one more time.

06:01.996 --> 06:03.463
And that's the last time

06:03.496 --> 06:06.701

or talked to each other.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.973
Some people would call me
a slut for that,

06:12.006 --> 06:14.508
but I honestly think

06:14.542 --> 06:19.379
it was one of the most
romantic moments of my life...

I would say
that you can start now,

- but you don't have any tools.
- Oh, no.

There's like a supporting part
for a woman my age

if you do it,

11:58.152 --> 12:00.988
maybe you can get me
a connection maybe,

18:44.525 --> 18:45.560
Don't need one.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.997
[Kathryn]
Alright, well, I guess.

18:49.030 --> 18:52.165
[dramatic music playing]

19:08.116 --> 19:09.449
[Kathryn]
<i>Are you a swimmer?</i>

19:09.483 --> 19:11.418
[Ben]
<i>Never really get the chance,</i>

19:11.451 --> 19:14.722
<i>but I'm pretty good</i>
<i>at most physical stuff.</i>

19:14.756 --> 19:16.758
Just, uh, not much up here.

19:16.791 --> 19:18.225
[coughs]

19:20.160 --> 19:21.495
What's the hurry?

19:22.997 --> 19:25.165
Uh, I have to
clean the house.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.101
You clean your own house?

19:27.135 --> 19:29.871
Gives me something to do
in between auditions.

19:29.904 --> 19:31.405
What's your husband think?

19:31.438 --> 19:34.241
- Of what?
- About the acting?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.911
He's a producer,
so he's super supportive.

19:36.944 --> 19:38.178
He gets it.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.516
Does that mean
he could get you a job?

19:42.349 --> 19:45.285
I want to get it on my own.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.421
You know, on my own terms.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.956
It's better that way.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.263
[intense music playing]

19:58.231 --> 19:59.667
[Kathryn]
"You want...

20:02.003 --> 20:03.538
Why don't you want me?

20:05.173 --> 20:06.874
Why don't you want me?

20:09.811 --> 20:11.378
[indistinct]

20:15.215 --> 20:16.651
Why don't you want me?"

20:26.293 --> 20:27.595
Hey, Ben.

20:27.628 --> 20:30.263
[Ben] Something I can do
for you, Mrs. Carlyle?

20:30.297 --> 20:32.332
Are you a good handy-man, too?

20:38.206 --> 20:40.575
[intense music continues]

20:48.950 --> 20:51.318
[banging]

21:01.229 --> 21:02.295
[car hood shuts]

21:02.329 --> 21:04.165
Give it a try.

21:04.198 --> 21:06.433
[car engine starting]

21:09.369 --> 21:10.938
Anything else I can do for you?

21:13.775 --> 21:15.342
Actually, yeah.

21:19.881 --> 21:21.348
"Why don't you want me?"

21:22.850 --> 21:24.919
[Ben]
"Look, I just--"

21:24.952 --> 21:26.554
"I wanna know why."

21:28.488 --> 21:34.695
"I just--
Well, I'm in love with her.

21:34.729 --> 21:35.897
I'm sorry."

21:38.166 --> 21:41.235
"Why aren't you
in love with me?"

21:41.269 --> 21:43.403
"That's never
what this was about.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.239
We were just..."

21:45.273 --> 21:47.575
"Just what?"

21:47.608 --> 21:49.911
- "Just..."
- "Just sex?

21:51.311 --> 21:54.182
Is that all
this ever was to you?"

21:54.215 --> 21:57.084
"I'm sorry.
It just wasn't meant to be."

21:58.653 --> 22:01.622
"If you walk out that door,
you are never coming back."

22:09.764 --> 22:11.866
[breathes deeply]

22:17.238 --> 22:18.806
You can press stop.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.709
[recorder beeps]

22:26.314 --> 22:27.782
So, what'd you think?

22:28.282 --> 22:29.517
[Ben sighs]

22:29.550 --> 22:31.586
Well, I don't know.

22:31.619 --> 22:33.688
It's pretty corny
if you ask me.

22:37.124 --> 22:40.027
Hey, no,
I-I mean the script.

22:40.061 --> 22:41.494
You were...

22:44.565 --> 22:47.668
Yeah, um,
I'm gonna get back to...

22:49.237 --> 22:51.172
Good work today.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.573
Thank you.

23:00.748 --> 23:02.884
Keep your damn money, lady.

23:11.525 --> 23:15.296
Look, please forgive an actress
for being sensitive.

23:15.329 --> 23:16.831
It's my job, you know?

23:19.734 --> 23:21.702
I'm sorry.

23:21.736 --> 23:25.106
You know, I meant that
the scene was corny, the words.

23:25.139 --> 23:27.775
But not you.
You were good.

23:30.144 --> 23:31.646
I shouldn't have said that.

23:33.514 --> 23:35.516
It doesn't matter.

23:36.617 --> 23:40.588
You know, I don't get you.

23:42.056 --> 23:43.391
What do you mean?

23:43.423 --> 23:44.825
Look, I don't have anything.

23:44.859 --> 23:47.261
I mean, I'm a broke,
poor loser.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.495
You know that, right?

23:48.529 --> 23:49.597
And I see your house
and your car,

23:49.630 --> 23:51.632
and you have everything.

23:51.666 --> 23:53.567
But you don't appreciate it.

23:53.601 --> 23:54.802
I mean, nothing works.

23:54.835 --> 23:55.937
You have all these
beautiful things

23:55.970 --> 23:58.806
and they aren't being
taken care of.

23:58.839 --> 24:01.575
You have to take care
of beautiful things.

24:02.643 --> 24:04.444
Look, I'm a plain
working-class guy.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.280
And, yeah, I've been to jail.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.682
My boss doesn't know that,
but there it is.

24:07.715 --> 24:09.150
You could get me fired
if you wanted to.

24:09.183 --> 24:11.018
And you could judge me
like everybody else does.

24:11.052 --> 24:13.120
But people don't see me.

24:13.154 --> 24:15.923
They don't see that I'm a--
I'm a stand-up guy.

24:15.957 --> 24:18.458
That I'm the type of guy
that you should call
when you're in a jam.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.961
I'm good with my hands.

24:19.994 --> 24:23.164
I can make up rhymes
that make people happy.

24:23.197 --> 24:24.932
You know, I'm worth something.

24:26.534 --> 24:28.536
You know, people don't see that.

24:31.072 --> 24:32.807
You ever feel that way?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.849
You have no idea
what it means to a guy like me

24:41.882 --> 24:44.185
to take a dip in a private pool.

24:51.092 --> 24:53.728
[intense music playing]

25:27.261 --> 25:31.065
[music continues]

25:53.687 --> 25:55.322
[Richard]
<i>Hey, were you sleeping?</i>

25:55.356 --> 25:56.490
[Kathryn]
<i>No, just napping.</i>

25:56.525 --> 25:59.660
[Richard]
<i>Oh, is everything alright?</i>

25:59.693 --> 26:04.265
- Yeah, I just had a dream.
- Oh, bad?

26:04.298 --> 26:07.201
I dreamed the pool got so hot,
all the water boiled away.

26:09.637 --> 26:13.107
You want me to-- you want me
to turn off the heater?

26:13.140 --> 26:14.608
No.

26:14.642 --> 26:17.645
- Ohh, what are you doing?
- Take off your clothes.

26:17.678 --> 26:20.414
Babe, no, no, no,
I got reservations.

26:20.448 --> 26:23.717
- How come?
- We're cheersing.

26:25.419 --> 26:26.954
Babe, you didn't
have to do that,

26:26.987 --> 26:28.155
I mean, it's just an online--

26:28.189 --> 26:30.491
I booked the actor.

26:30.525 --> 26:32.760
Yeah, it was just a meeting.

26:32.793 --> 26:36.330
Anyway, I-- he wants me
to fly out to San Francisco.

26:37.498 --> 26:40.501
- When?
- Tomorrow.

26:40.535 --> 26:41.669
[voices fade]

26:41.702 --> 26:44.672
- For how long?
- Just for the day.

26:44.705 --> 26:46.674
[muted dialogue]

26:52.480 --> 26:54.882
[Kathryn]
<i>Did I ever tell you</i>
<i>what happened to Jorge?</i>

26:54.915 --> 26:55.916
Who?

26:55.950 --> 26:57.318
[Kathryn]
The gardener.

26:57.351 --> 26:58.419
No.

26:58.452 --> 27:00.121
They said that he was detained.

27:00.154 --> 27:04.225
- Like he was late?
- No, like he's in custody.

27:04.258 --> 27:07.761
Oh. ICE?

27:07.795 --> 27:08.996
God, wait, do you think?

27:09.029 --> 27:12.032
No, do we have any extra ice?

27:12.066 --> 27:14.802
Oh, yeah, um,
there's some in the ice bucket.

27:17.071 --> 27:18.806
You know, I think that you
should do something, because--

27:18.839 --> 27:20.875
I don't think it's a good idea
to get involved, babe.

27:20.908 --> 27:23.477
I mean, you don't know this guy.

27:23.512 --> 27:26.147
Yes, I do.
I'm here with him all day.

27:26.180 --> 27:27.314
He's a very sweet man.

27:27.348 --> 27:28.749
But you don't really.

27:28.782 --> 27:31.185
You could be vouching for
a criminal, you know?

27:31.218 --> 27:33.622
I think it's best
if you just drop it, babe.

27:35.956 --> 27:37.691
So, what are you gonna do?

27:38.993 --> 27:42.396
- Drop it, I guess.
- No, about the lawn.

27:44.465 --> 27:48.435
Oh, they hired
a new guy already.

27:48.469 --> 27:51.138
Huh? How is he?

27:52.740 --> 27:55.843
[intense music playing]

27:59.581 --> 28:01.782
[muted dialogue]

28:27.808 --> 28:30.044
[intense music continues]

28:49.964 --> 28:52.266
[Richard]
Where are you going?

28:52.299 --> 28:54.201
I left the pool light on.

28:54.235 --> 28:55.869
I can turn in off.

28:55.903 --> 28:58.005
No, I'm already up.

29:31.706 --> 29:34.441
[bird calling]

29:40.014 --> 29:42.517
[loud rock music playing]

29:51.726 --> 29:53.662
Hey!

29:53.695 --> 29:55.296
Excuse me?

29:56.531 --> 29:57.898
[Ben]
Hey!

29:58.899 --> 30:00.801
Hey, you left
your side door open.

30:02.436 --> 30:03.605
Who's up there?

30:03.638 --> 30:05.439
No one should be up there.

30:06.775 --> 30:08.409
Hey, Ed!

30:08.442 --> 30:10.878
[rock music continues]

30:16.850 --> 30:18.886
Turn that down, man!

30:23.957 --> 30:26.226
That's, uh,
that's Ed Hogate.

30:26.260 --> 30:28.797
I met him yesterday.
He just bought
the Anderson's place.

30:28.829 --> 30:30.632
Oh, really?

30:30.665 --> 30:31.932
[Ben] Yeah, he saw me working

30:31.965 --> 30:34.335
and asked me to do
some handy work for him.

30:34.368 --> 30:36.837
I think he said
maybe he met your husband.

30:36.870 --> 30:38.972
Oh, Richard
left for San Francisco.

30:39.006 --> 30:41.676
Oh, well, business?

30:41.710 --> 30:44.779
You know, I didn't think that
you were scheduled for today.

30:44.813 --> 30:48.115
Yeah, I'm not,
but I thought maybe you'd, uh...

30:48.148 --> 30:51.318
maybe you'd let me
take you out to get some brunch

30:51.352 --> 30:53.053
or something like that.

30:53.087 --> 30:54.823
To thank you for the job

30:54.855 --> 30:59.059
and just for being
so nice to me.

30:59.093 --> 31:00.160
Ben...

31:01.228 --> 31:02.396
[chuckles]

31:02.429 --> 31:04.498
I don't even know
what brunch means.

31:06.701 --> 31:10.104
Why don't I just cook us up
a couple of burgers instead?

31:10.137 --> 31:11.972
Oh, don't go through
any trouble for me.

31:12.005 --> 31:15.275
Oh, no, please
don't worry about it.

31:15.309 --> 31:16.377
Okay.

31:17.478 --> 31:18.813
Go invite Ed.

31:18.847 --> 31:20.548
I want to meet my new neighbor.

31:21.816 --> 31:23.050
Okay.

31:34.962 --> 31:38.132
[Ben] Mrs. Carlyle,
let me introduce you to Ed.

31:38.165 --> 31:40.367
[Kathryn] Oh, please,
you can call me Kathryn.

31:41.536 --> 31:42.936
- How are you, Ed?
- Hi.

31:44.037 --> 31:45.372
Uh, have a seat.

31:52.079 --> 31:55.482
Oh, and um, how do you
want your burger cooked?

31:55.517 --> 31:57.017
On the grill is fine.

32:00.053 --> 32:02.322
Well, uh, eat please.

32:05.727 --> 32:07.729
Oh, I used lemon dressing.

32:07.762 --> 32:08.962
You know, I'm trying
to lose weight,

32:08.996 --> 32:10.164
so everyone has to suffer.

32:10.197 --> 32:13.400
Come on,
you're in great shape.

32:13.434 --> 32:17.639
Mmm, yeah, where could you
lose it from?

32:17.672 --> 32:20.374
Oh, you both
are being very nice.

32:20.407 --> 32:24.211
So, how'd you end up, uh,
buying the Anderson's place?

32:24.244 --> 32:26.346
I work at Silicon Valley.

32:27.948 --> 32:31.653
That's where
I made all my money,

32:31.686 --> 32:36.089
so I thought I'd come down here
and give old Hollyweird a try.

32:36.123 --> 32:38.358
-[chuckles]
-[Ed] Look, here's my card.

32:41.729 --> 32:46.300
"Zzzombi. Product manager".

32:46.333 --> 32:49.336
Yes, you see, I'm in charge of
the product team.

32:49.369 --> 32:51.539
They're the ones
who build the applications.

32:53.073 --> 32:55.510
A bunch of degenerates
and thieves, if you ask me,

32:55.543 --> 32:58.178
but they're the ones
who get advertisers

32:58.212 --> 33:00.080
to buy space on the app,

33:01.181 --> 33:04.117
which is all about
sleep technology.

33:04.151 --> 33:06.888
Z, Z, Z, "Zzzombi."

33:06.921 --> 33:10.324
"Sleep like the dead." Hmm.

33:10.357 --> 33:15.295
So, I'm the one that's pulling
all the strings from the top.

33:15.329 --> 33:18.298
You gotta keep them separate,
the groups.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.100
There's the snakes,
and the rats

33:20.133 --> 33:22.102
and the birds, and...

33:26.306 --> 33:29.042
So, if you wanna
download the app,

33:29.076 --> 33:31.245
I can give you a 15% discount.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.949
Sure, Ed.

33:34.983 --> 33:36.283
Thank you.

33:38.385 --> 33:41.890
Um, are you guys ready
for your burgers?

33:41.923 --> 33:43.423
[Ben] You're the hostess.

34:00.140 --> 34:02.476
Thought maybe you
could use some help.

34:02.510 --> 34:06.014
Oh, yeah, um,
can you get the butter?

34:06.046 --> 34:07.515
- In here? Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:12.085 --> 34:13.922
Hey, why don't you
let me do that?

34:13.955 --> 34:16.623
I was a diner cook
up in Fresno.

34:18.091 --> 34:19.426
What haven't you done?

34:23.898 --> 34:26.534
Where did you
first meet your husband?

34:26.568 --> 34:29.469
Um, on a movie.

34:29.504 --> 34:33.041
Yeah, I-I had one line
in a movie he produced.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.109
And he asked me out,
and I said no,

34:36.143 --> 34:38.612
because I didn't want everyone
to think--

34:38.646 --> 34:41.683
I mean, well,
you know what I mean.

34:41.716 --> 34:45.152
But he kept asking
and then he kept asking
after we wrapped,

34:45.185 --> 34:47.922
and then that's when I knew
that it wasn't just like

34:47.956 --> 34:50.324
a silly little thing.

34:50.357 --> 34:53.126

01:09:43.051 --> 01:09:45.653
[chuckles]

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:47.854
Come on, man.

01:09:47.889 --> 01:09:49.890
This-this is...

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:51.792
-[Duke] "Zzzombi."
-Yeah.

01:09:51.826 --> 01:09:53.359
[Duke]
That's your card.

01:09:53.393 --> 01:09:55.897
Your name is Ed Hogate.

01:10:00.168 --> 01:10:04.172
Mrs. Carlyle,
let me introduce you to Ed.

01:10:04.204 --> 01:10:05.405
Oh...

01:10:07.108 --> 01:10:10.878
[dramatic music playing]

01:10:42.844 --> 01:10:44.311
I knew it.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.248
You were just
after her all along.

01:10:50.518 --> 01:10:52.820
Then where's the safe?
Let's get this over with.

01:10:54.889 --> 01:10:57.058
There's no safe, you idiot.

01:10:57.091 --> 01:10:58.893
There never was a safe.

01:11:00.962 --> 01:11:02.830
Look, we're here for her.

01:11:02.864 --> 01:11:06.534
I'll give you first crack at her
if you stop fucking this up.

01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:14.441
[slow tempo music playing]

01:11:24.952 --> 01:11:27.287
I don't wanna go in there.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.224
It's okay.
You don't wanna be sick, right?

01:11:30.258 --> 01:11:32.627
No, I'm-- I really don't
want to go in there.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.395
It's okay.
It's okay, I got you.

01:11:42.003 --> 01:11:44.172
[Kathryn] I can't.

01:11:44.205 --> 01:11:46.674
Yeah, chill.
Here you go. Here you go.

01:11:46.707 --> 01:11:47.842
It's okay.

01:11:48.943 --> 01:11:50.511
This is our bed.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.414
We can somewhere else.

01:11:58.085 --> 01:12:00.688
- We can go next door.
- Hmm?

01:12:10.698 --> 01:12:15.770
I, uh, I need to tell you
something first.

01:12:15.803 --> 01:12:17.872
About Oates.

01:12:17.905 --> 01:12:18.940
[Kathryn]
What?

01:12:20.942 --> 01:12:26.413
He, uh, he doesn't really work
in Silicon Valley.

01:12:27.782 --> 01:12:29.617
I know.

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:31.986
He didn't buy
the Anderson's place.

01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:34.889
He's squatting.

01:12:36.858 --> 01:12:38.526
He told me not to rat.

01:12:40.194 --> 01:12:41.963
He asked me to help him.

01:12:43.664 --> 01:12:46.499
He wants something
that doesn't belong to him.

01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:49.971
[Kathryn]
What?

01:12:53.741 --> 01:12:54.775
You.

01:13:00.681 --> 01:13:02.817
<i>That's why he stormed off,</i>
<i>you see?</i>

01:13:04.919 --> 01:13:07.420
<i>I wouldn't let him do it,</i>
<i>Kathryn.</i>

01:13:09.523 --> 01:13:11.092
<i>I wouldn't let him hurt you.</i>

01:13:13.628 --> 01:13:17.131
<i>Do you know why... Kathryn?</i>

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.842
It's because
I'm in love with you.

01:13:32.647 --> 01:13:37.885
[mysterious music playing]

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.528
[Duke] <i>We're somewhere else.</i>

01:14:56.496 --> 01:14:57.765
We're here.

01:15:14.048 --> 01:15:15.182
No.

01:15:59.593 --> 01:16:01.028
Take her.

01:17:05.659 --> 01:17:08.963
Quit moving or I'm gonna
cut your fucking head off!

01:17:08.996 --> 01:17:11.732
[muffled grunts]

01:17:13.934 --> 01:17:17.771

01:17:25.212 --> 01:17:26.480
[grunts]

01:17:26.515 --> 01:17:29.150
[panting] I can't.

01:17:46.133 --> 01:17:48.435
[Oates] Don't tell him
I couldn't do it!

01:17:52.406 --> 01:17:55.009
[crying]

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:04.485
[Duke] <i>How could you?</i>

01:18:04.519 --> 01:18:05.819
<i>How could you?</i>

01:18:07.622 --> 01:18:10.157
Duke, don't!
Don't hit her.

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:12.059
Don't--
[grunts]

01:18:12.092 --> 01:18:13.761
[splashing]

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:46.060
[screams, groans]

01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:49.763
[coughing]

01:18:50.632 --> 01:18:53.535
Duke! Duke!

01:18:53.568 --> 01:18:55.269
Alright, Duke, I can't--

01:18:56.837 --> 01:18:59.039
I can't-- I can't move.

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:01.509
Help!

01:19:04.245 --> 01:19:06.347
I'm sorry!

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.249
I'm sorry I couldn't do it.

01:19:10.117 --> 01:19:11.919
I'm sorry!

01:19:28.002 --> 01:19:31.005
[breathing heavily]

01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:36.645
[911 operator on phone]

01:19:36.678 --> 01:19:37.878
I--

01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:50.924
[Oates shouts, groaning]

01:19:56.665 --> 01:19:58.399
Help!

01:19:58.432 --> 01:20:00.034
[Duke]

01:20:22.757 --> 01:20:24.391
[Oates, muffled yelling]

01:20:26.528 --> 01:20:27.928
Duke, she's here!

01:20:28.563 --> 01:20:30.297
She's here, Duke!

01:20:30.331 --> 01:20:32.933
- Please, be quiet.
- Duke, she's here!

01:20:32.966 --> 01:20:34.134
She's here, Duke!

01:20:34.168 --> 01:20:36.236
- [shushes]
- [grunting]

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:44.445

01:21:21.315 --> 01:21:23.417
[muffled yelling]

01:22:37.024 --> 01:22:38.125
[Richard] Kathryn!

01:22:38.158 --> 01:22:40.394
[Kathryn]
Richard! Please, help me.

01:22:40.427 --> 01:22:41.428

Run.

Kathryn?

01:23:49.664 --> 01:23:50.765
You alright?

01:23:54.334 --> 01:23:58.238
I wasn't... but I am now.

01:24:16.758 --> 01:24:18.560
Let's forget what happened.

01:24:19.594 --> 01:24:21.261
It's in the past.

01:24:22.597 --> 01:24:26.433
Let's try to be
better together, alright?

01:24:29.303 --> 01:24:33.273
I love you,
do you know that?

01:24:38.078 --> 01:24:40.113
Do you love me, too?

01:24:43.918 --> 01:24:45.352

And cut!

01:24:49.122 --> 01:24:50.324
Alright,
everybody gather around.

Everybody on set, please.

01:24:51.726 --> 01:24:53.595
Can I have your attention?

01:24:53.628 --> 01:24:56.096
That's a picture wrap
for Kathryn Carlyle.
