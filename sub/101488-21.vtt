WEBVTT

00:29.195 --> 00:30.196
-It easily could.
-(door opens)

00:30.280 --> 00:32.282
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hey, guys.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.616
What are you doing on the laptop, Bob?

00:33.700 --> 00:36.119
Bunch of spreadsheets?
Something with Bitcoin?

00:36.202 --> 00:38.913
Oh, uh, I'm on that neighborhood website.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.373
The one where people post about stuff

00:40.457 --> 00:42.709
going on in the area
slash yell at each other?

00:42.792 --> 00:44.627
Yep. There's a guy who's growing cucumbers

00:44.711 --> 00:47.464
in his basement and every day he
posts a picture of them growing.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.591
It's really interesting. Take a look.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.509
That's definitely cucumbers
in a guy's basement.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.678
God, I can't wait until he posts again.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.847
Yeah that's great, hon.
Oh, crap, I just remembered.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.265
I told Gene it's mac and cheese night,

00:57.349 --> 00:59.184
but we don't have any mac and cheese.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.019
-I got to go to the store.
-Yeah, you do.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.146
That's an emergency.
Last time we didn't have mac and cheese,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.523
-he called the police on us.
-Hey, if I go now,

01:05.607 --> 01:07.442
I can meet the kids
and walk them home from school.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.403
I mean, they already like
you better, but okay.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.821
I wish I could walk with my mom,

01:11.905 --> 01:14.074
but she's going through
a skateboard phase.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.575
A woman walking down the street

01:15.658 --> 01:17.660
with a bag full of mac and cheese.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.454
Bob Dylan had a song about that, I think.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.164
What can I tell you? I'm a great mom.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.457
And I'm not just saying that

01:22.540 --> 01:23.792
'cause Mother's Day is coming up.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.168
Right. Mother's Day.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.961
Man, I just hope we have
enough wrapping paper.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.588
That's my main concern.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.465
Really? I'm concerned
we don't have any presents.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.841
-Gene.
-Aw.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.218
Brown Rice Bonanza closed.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.303
It wasn't as exciting
as they made it sound.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.389
Hey, there's that trash can.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.224
The one people add stuff to sometimes

01:39.307 --> 01:40.809
and make it look like a little person.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.311
Oh, yeah. I remember when
someone gave it a mustache.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.980
-It was like trashy hot Dad.
-Ooh, I have an idea.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.150
Okay, ripping this cup in half,
and who's got a pen?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.236
Me.
Here's my third-favorite pen.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.279
Eh... And...

01:53.363 --> 01:55.198
now the trash can has little feet. Ha!

01:55.281 --> 01:56.616
-Nice. -TINA: I love it.
-LOUISE: Mm-hmm.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.034
Shoes on a trash can?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.953
-That's fun.
-It is, isn't it?

02:00.036 --> 02:01.955
-It really is.
-Can I get that pen back?

02:02.038 --> 02:04.124
'Cause, you know, third-favorite.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.167
Hey, guys.
How was your walk home?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.920
Great. You know that trash can
on Harbor Road

02:09.004 --> 02:10.422
that people decorate sometimes?

02:10.505 --> 02:12.298
I made little paper cup shoes for it.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.550
And there was a guy who liked it.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.884
He was like, "Ha."

02:14.968 --> 02:16.302
I know that trash can.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.722
One time someone taped
big paper teeth on it.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.640
Made it kind of difficult to put trash in,

02:20.724 --> 02:23.351
but it made me laugh, and a little scared.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.562
I mean, getting the trash in
is kind of important.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.647
It's like the trash can's only job.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.567
-Dad, this is why you're single.
-I-I'm not single.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.361
Ooh, I should set you up
with my roommate Linda.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.738
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>Lot of comments</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:36.031
on the cucumber guy.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.657
I mean, they're from me, but...

02:37.741 --> 02:39.325
You're reading your own comments?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.786
Yeah, they're really good.
I worked hard on them.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.788
Hey, look at this, there's
a post about the trash can

02:43.872 --> 02:46.124
-can you decorated.
-What? It's in the news?

02:46.207 --> 02:49.210
-Uh, i-it's not the news.
-"Great shoes, trash can."

02:49.294 --> 02:51.379
And somebody put a happy face emoji.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.090
Aw. And this person wrote,
"Does anyone have

02:54.174 --> 02:56.968
any free moving boxes?"
What the hell's that?

02:57.052 --> 02:59.721
Yeah, people on here are always
looking for free moving boxes.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.306
It's, like, 80% of the posts.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.266
Well, how about that?

03:03.350 --> 03:06.686
My little trash can shoes
making people a little happier.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.897
That'll make me sleep easy tonight...

03:08.980 --> 03:11.608
-(snoring)
-Yeah, yep. Good night.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.862
-Bob's Burgers.
-Linda, it's Teddy.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.490
Listen, I'm at the trash can
to see the shoes you put on it.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.825
They're not there,
unless I'm in the wrong place.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.911
Oh, geez, am I even in the right town?

03:22.994 --> 03:25.121
Aw.
Well, maybe I'll go there later

03:25.205 --> 03:26.539
and put some more on it, right?

03:26.623 --> 03:29.292
-Keep the party going?
-Yeah! Trash can party.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.543
Hello, ma'am.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.884
Do you think Mom would want
a lightly-stained dish cloth

03:37.967 --> 03:39.552
for Mother's Day?
Wait, dang it.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.305
I got her that a couple of years ago,
never mind.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.307
-Hey, Teddy.
-Gone again.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.309
I drive by the trash can,
hoping for a little joy

03:46.393 --> 03:48.937
and cheer, and nothing, nothing.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.480
Seriously?
Well, you know what?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.065
I'm gonna go put them back on right now,

03:52.148 --> 03:53.525
'cause those shoes are fun.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.068
-I'll come, too.
-I'm coming, too.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.112
Like I'm not gonna go on a trash-venture?

03:57.195 --> 03:59.531
I'll stay here and wipe menus.
Just kidding. Wait up.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.700
-Sorry, Dad. We're cool, right?
-Yeah, we're cool.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.535
-I get it.
-Oh, good.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.663
This is gonna be a great
pair of shoes, aren't you?

04:06.746 --> 04:07.997
Look, someone put up a sign.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.000
LINDA:
"Vandalism is Prohibited."

04:10.083 --> 04:11.710
What I did isn't vandalism.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.921
It's not <i>not</i> vandalism,
and that's what I love about it.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.840
What kind of crumb bum would do this?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.925
Look, someone shredded your shoes.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.719
Or they're distressed in a cool way?

04:20.802 --> 04:23.555
Why would they do that? Why...
What... Who would do that?

04:23.638 --> 04:27.058
-What kind of monster?
-All right, Mr. Sign, let's see how you like it.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.102
A-rip, a-rip, a-rip.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.522
And now these brand-new shoes
are going on.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.232
Ha, ha!
Look at those shoes.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.984
Just like I pictured them.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.902
I'm gonna be riding this high for a while.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.238
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>You know, I just don't understand.</i>

04:40.321 --> 04:41.823
Who'd get mad at my shoes?

04:41.906 --> 04:43.742
Putting stuff
on that trash can is just, like,

04:43.825 --> 04:46.578
a fun, dumb tradition that
makes people a little happier.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.080
-Like childbirth.
-Mom, this is great.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.832
We vandalize... I...
(exhales)

04:50.915 --> 04:53.043
I mean, put stuff on the trash can,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.128
they take it down, we put it up again.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.173
This could be our career.
Wait, do we even need the restaurant?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.883
-Louise.
-You know, you're right.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.302
They're just gonna do it again.
We got to find out who did this.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.013
If I go right now, kind of stake it out,

05:05.096 --> 05:07.349
I might catch them in the act.
Red-handled.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.517
Wait. You're gonna
stake out the trash can?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.353
-Yeah. Keep up, Dad.
-I'll stay if you want.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.979
No? You don't need me?
Great.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.481
-Stop leaving the restaurant.
-(door opens)

05:14.564 --> 05:16.107
You are obsessed with this place.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.567
It'll be super quick, Bob.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.903
In bed by 9:00, lights out by 9:30.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.906
No, we're not staking out the trash can.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.033
We're just window-shopping for vacuums.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.659
Ooh, that's a nice one.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.286
TINA:
Look at those attachments. (whistles)

05:28.370 --> 05:30.330
Kids, no, no, just pretend.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.874
Okay, I'm just gonna
casually look over my shoulder.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.959
Nobody's there, nobody's there.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.586
Mom, when we catch this person,
what'd you bring

05:36.670 --> 05:37.879
as far as subduing them?

05:37.962 --> 05:40.006
Some kind of fishing net,
or what are we doing?

05:40.090 --> 05:41.174
I didn't bring anything.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.967
Okay.
I brought salt from the restaurant.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.053
We throw it in their eyes
and then we sit on them.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.138
Hey, can I have some of that salt?
I brought fries.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.723
No, no salt.
When we catch them,

05:48.807 --> 05:50.183
we're gonna give them a good talking-to.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.102
With our fists and chest kicks.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.020
Shh, shh, shh. Someone's coming.
(shushing)

05:54.104 --> 05:55.855
He's going towards it.
Get ready.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.024
Stand down.
Hold your salt.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.276
Just tossing trash.
Just a tosser.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.195
-A litter quitter.
-LOUISE: Look at that cordless one.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.781
Ooh, la, la. Mom, it's on sale.
You love sales.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.826
We're not getting a vac...
Ooh, that is nice.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.953
Oh, a car's pulling up.
That could be them.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.038
-Attack the car.
-No. Not attack the car.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.457
Ugh, delivery truck.
Now I can't see.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.043
Come on, let's go around it.
Go, go, go.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.170
But look both ways, but go.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.048
(gasps)
It's the shoe swiper.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.466
Hey, you!
Stop!

06:23.550 --> 06:24.884
Step away from the trash can.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.052
(shouts)
What the...?

06:26.136 --> 06:27.846
(gasps)
Cynthia?

06:27.929 --> 06:30.432
Hello, Linda.
Just yelling at people on the street

06:30.515 --> 06:32.058
like a normal person?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.394
-Mom, salt.
-Season her.

06:37.397 --> 06:41.192
Cynthia, you're the one
taking down our trash can shoes?

06:41.276 --> 06:43.903
I sure am.
You're the one playing with trash?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.530
What's your problem, Cynthia?

06:45.613 --> 06:47.907
What do you have against
delightful trash shoes?

06:47.991 --> 06:49.993
I'm the leasing agent for this valuable

06:50.076 --> 06:52.328
and attractive commercial property,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.956
and I'm trying to bring in
a serious business.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.169
Do you know who's interested
in this space? Pretzel Kingdom.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.337
-(gasps) -Oh, my.
-Whoa.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.714
Pretzel Kingdom?
The soft pretzel chain?

07:02.797 --> 07:06.134
Yes. We'd finally be getting
a chain in this neighborhood,

07:06.217 --> 07:08.803
and I don't want to scare them
off with that foolishness.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.972
-We'd be a Pretzel Kingdom town?
-Gene.

07:11.056 --> 07:14.517
Linda, you should want to bring
in desirable businesses,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.561
because it'd be good for your business.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.646
Hey, my business is none of your business.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.690
Question: is this
the full Pretzel Kingdom

07:20.774 --> 07:21.900
or a Pretzel Kingdom Express?

07:21.983 --> 07:23.485
-Gene.
-Full.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.944
-Good lord.
-Tina, shush.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.696
Listen, nothing's gonna stop me

07:26.780 --> 07:28.031
from decorating this trash can

07:28.114 --> 07:29.866
to make it look like a little person.
Nothing.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.203
But it's vandalism.
It's defacing public property.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.789
No, it's add-facing public property.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.624
'Cause I might add a face
if I feel like it.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.043
-Mm, let's call it vandalism.
-Louise, shushies.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.296
Well, whatever face you put up,
I'm gonna take right down.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.632
Well, then, I'm gonna put it
right back up again.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.510
I will never stop putting
fun things on this trash can

07:48.593 --> 07:50.261
until the day I die.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.056
Of tetanus, probably,
from touching all that trash.

07:53.139 --> 07:57.852
Leave it alone.
This will be a Pretzel Kingdom.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.437
I just got chills.
Sorry.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.564
-Me, too. Sorry.
-(grunts)

08:01.648 --> 08:03.650
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>And then someone else commented</i>

08:03.733 --> 08:05.777
that the cucumber was ripe,
but it clearly had

08:05.860 --> 08:08.405
more ripening to do,
and I almost commented that,

08:08.488 --> 08:10.198
-but then I didn't.
-Sheesh.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.825
You tell me <i>my</i> stories are long.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.535
-How's it going here?
-This pirate hat

08:13.618 --> 08:14.744
is really coming together.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.663
-With staples.
-I love it.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.832
And I'm almost done coloring
the pirate's parrot.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.709
I went with purple,
'cause that's what we had.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.629
Ooh, this is gonna be one fun <i>garbage</i> can.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.464
-(laughs)
-Ha. Pirates.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.508
Good work, kids.
Take that, you buzzkills.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.510
-We're gonna beat you.
-And this sword I made

08:30.593 --> 08:31.886
is definitely not a wiener.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.471
(whispers): It's a wiener.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.432
Oh, that's beautiful.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.100
Look what we can do as a family.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.810
-I'll be taking those.
-What?

08:38.893 --> 08:40.562
-Hey.
-Logan!

08:40.645 --> 08:43.398
My mom paid me ten bucks.
See ya!

08:43.481 --> 08:44.983
Now she's got people working for her?

08:45.066 --> 08:47.986
(growls) This is war.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.339
<i>LINDA: "Hats off to whoever</i>

09:07.422 --> 09:09.215
"on the trash can.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.383

09:10.467 --> 09:12.135
Take that, Cynthia, you jerk.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.429
She did take that.
I mean, Logan took that.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.431
Oh, my God, cucumber guy just posted.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.391
-Here, gimme, gi-gimme, gimme.
-Whoa. Geez.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.643
Do not get between Bob and his cuce.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.938
Look at that. R-Really
puts it all in perspective, doesn't it?

09:24.022 --> 09:26.149
I got to admit,
when I close my eyes and picture

09:26.232 --> 09:28.401
the perfect cucumber, it looks like that.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.320
-Call me when it's a pickle.
-Lot of comments.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.614
They're all about people
looking for free moving boxes.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.241
-Is that code for drugs?
-I don't think it is.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.951
-Ooh, scuba diver. -Huh?
-What?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.204
Scuba diver.
For the trash can.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.455
Love it.
On it.

09:40.538 --> 09:41.831
Cynthia didn't count on me

09:41.915 --> 09:44.542
having an unlimited number
of trash can ideas.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.086
-You do?
-No, I'm running out.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.962
That took me 20 minutes to think of.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.756
Look at these flippers.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.300
Look at this mask.
You guys are geniuses.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.718
Don't listen to them at that school.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.387
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.098
And then I said, "I'm running
for reelection, not jogging.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.307
-(gasps)
-And you're fired."

09:59.391 --> 10:01.393
-(whispers): Crap. Hide.
-(laughter)

10:03.311 --> 10:05.563
Well, Cynthia, the space looks gorgeous.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.482
Right?
The Pretzel Kingdom people

10:07.565 --> 10:09.818
would be morons not to sign the lease.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.571
I cannot wait for us to finally
be a Pretzel Kingdom town.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.241
-We deserve it.
-Great job, Mrs. Bush.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.992
Thanks, Mr. Bush.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.578
-Dr. Mr. Bush.
-Right, well, it helps to know

10:20.662 --> 10:23.957
the entire city council
is as jazzed as I am.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.042
What?
Those are the city council people?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.711
And as far as voting

10:27.794 --> 10:30.088
on that anti-trash can
"decorating" resolution

10:30.171 --> 10:32.799
that my city councilperson
husband proposed...

10:32.882 --> 10:34.676
Dr. Mr. City Councilperson.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.428
Franklin, we have your vote?

10:36.511 --> 10:38.013
-Yes, you do.
-And mine.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.056
And hubby's.
Your little Tom Tom.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.558
BOTH:
Ah, ha, ha.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.102
Anyway, see everybody
at the meeting Friday.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.147
And you'll see me tonight
'cause it's you-know-what night.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.524
-Tom, please.
-What? It's <i>Scrabble</i> night.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.151
What the hell? Cynthia's getting

10:51.234 --> 10:53.278
an anti-trash can decorating thing passed?

10:53.361 --> 10:55.613
-Damn, she's good at this.
-Really good.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.240
Do you think they'd let
us come to <i>Scrabble</i> night

10:57.323 --> 10:58.491
if we asked nicely?

10:58.575 --> 11:00.160
Wait, is that the thing with the letters?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.579
Never mind.
I'm thinking of "scramble."

11:04.664 --> 11:06.082
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>Ugh! I can't believe</i>

11:06.166 --> 11:07.959
Cynthia's gonna
get the city council

11:08.043 --> 11:10.420
to vote on an anti-trash can
decorating resolution.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.380
I didn't even know our city had a council.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.299
Yeah, I felt like I was on <i>West Wing.</i>

11:14.382 --> 11:17.427
Should I, I don't know, do something?
Talk to people?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.012
See if they would go to the meeting?

11:19.095 --> 11:21.306
I mean, people love
being asked to go to meetings.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.350
Yeah.
They're fun, right?

11:23.433 --> 11:25.935
Okay, so I'll go make
some flyers and hit the streets.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.688
A flyer about a meeting?
Delightful.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.732
Uh-huh.
♪ <i>Flyers.</i> ♪

11:30.815 --> 11:34.027
Gene, Tina, can you help me
fold some socks in my room?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.195
Okay, but I'm not a folder.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.447
-I'm more of a baller.
-Yeah, you are.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.948
All right, after we do your socks,

11:39.032 --> 11:40.283
you guys want to come into my room

11:40.367 --> 11:41.785
-and help me sort my shorts?
-No.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.038
Listen, what would be
the best Mother's Day gift ever?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.623
If you actually did fold your own socks?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.124
Forget about the socks.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.418
Well, now all I can think about
is the socks.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.128
Guys, Mom's plan is not gonna work.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.590
But what if we surprise her
with a city council victory?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.550
What if we do a little city council recon?

11:57.634 --> 11:59.260
We figure out where they can be found,

11:59.344 --> 12:00.553
and we pay 'em a little visit

12:00.637 --> 12:02.180
and convince them to vote Mom's way.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.182
Bing, bang, boom, Mother's Day present.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.558
And if we succeed,

12:05.642 --> 12:07.602
it's a kid's day present for us kids

12:07.686 --> 12:09.396
because we get to keep doing vandalism

12:09.479 --> 12:12.023
that's somehow parent-approved,
so it's a win-win.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.817
-Sounds "winderful."
-Gene's in.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.111
-Tina?
-Well, we do need a Mother's Day present

12:16.194 --> 12:17.696
'cause we got nothing,

12:17.779 --> 12:19.614
and I've been off my game
in the homemade card department.

12:19.698 --> 12:20.949
I know you guys have felt it.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.826
No...

12:22.909 --> 12:25.120
Hi.
Do you care about things?

12:25.203 --> 12:27.080
Okay, you're not slowing down.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.165
Sir, how do you feel about fun trash?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.501
Hi.
Do you like to smile?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.795
Would you be willing
to go to a city council meeting

12:33.878 --> 12:36.589
Friday at 5:00
to speak up against a resolu...

12:36.673 --> 12:38.341
Oh, you're walking away.
Okay.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.428
LOUISE: All right,
let's find city council big shot

12:41.511 --> 12:42.762
and tennis lover Heather Rockway.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.515
Or as I call her, Tennis the Menace.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.100
-(Heather laughs)
-Okay.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.644
That's definitely Heather
right behind me. Tina, go.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.731
(clears throat)
Well, uh, it's hard to argue

12:52.814 --> 12:55.358
with the results of this new research

12:55.442 --> 12:58.069
from our child think tank
that's totally respected

12:58.153 --> 12:59.529
in the child think tank community.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.990
-And the child tank top community.
-Yeah.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.201
Who knew the number one way
to increase soft pretzel sales

13:05.285 --> 13:07.829
was to have a fun
and festive trash can nearby?

13:07.912 --> 13:11.499
It's a damn good thing our town
has some decorative trash cans.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.501
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you heard about this?

13:13.585 --> 13:16.629
About the cutting-edge trash
can-pretzel synergy research?

13:16.713 --> 13:19.049
Are you kids even members here?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.842
How did that not work?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.969
I mean, the numbers were there.
You can't argue with the data.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.929
It's pronounced "dah-ta."

13:25.013 --> 13:27.223
First it's just a prickly little thing,

13:27.307 --> 13:29.559
-and then it's a vegetable.
-In the guy's basement.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.437
He-he wanted to grow food,
and he didn't have a yard,

13:32.520 --> 13:34.105
and he grew it anyway.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.815
It's like anything is possible.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.817
I'm sorry I didn't see what you saw.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.903
Yeah.
So, that's all his old posts.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.864
But the weird thing
is he stopped posting a few days ago.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.201
No! I need to know what happens.
What do we do till then?

13:46.284 --> 13:48.244
We just try and live, Teddy.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.413
We just try and live.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.123
Well, well, well.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.918
Honorable City Councilman
Franklin Wilmington.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.296
Illegally feeding pigeons in the park.
Tsk, tsk.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.298
It's not illegal.
Is it?

14:00.382 --> 14:02.425
Let me pass the bar real quick,
and I'll get back to you.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.052
Nobody has to know about this.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.720
It can stay between us and the pigeons.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.931

14:10.684 --> 14:13.186
They were finally starting to trust me.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.273
-Still no posts.
-Ah, what do I do? What do I do?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.150
Maybe I should decorate a trash can

14:19.234 --> 14:21.027
to look like Cynthia.
That would show her.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.779
I mean, probably not?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.199
Uh, you don't want to use
your trash can powers for evil,

14:26.282 --> 14:28.827
-do you?
-Yeah, maybe you're right.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.667
That's so impressive.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.918
I'll just check real quick.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.810
No. It's way better
that we're on the same page.

One time, I briefly considered
getting a tattoo

14:56.104 --> 14:59.691
of my favorite band, 311,
and it was unpleasant at home.

-Ugh!
-Uh, I don't want you guys to leave empty-handed.

-Mom, just sit.
-CYNTHIA: Hmm.

-Meh. -Good one, Mom.

-Eh, I don't want to.

This isn't a court, but sure.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.981
-Aw, what's the point?
-Because we got to beat the buzzkills.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.233
-Yeah. -Come on, Mom.
-All right, fine.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.528
Um, is there a microphone
somewhere or... What do I do?

17:08.611 --> 17:11.906
You can just stay where you are
and use your mouth for talking.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.867
Okay, look, I know you don't think much

17:13.950 --> 17:15.368
of the trash can decoration.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.704
And yeah, at first,
I thought it was just dumb fun.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.081
But you know what?
We need dumb fun.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.791
Especially if things are crappy.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.169
And if one dumb thing
that's not hurting anybody

17:24.252 --> 17:26.129
can put a smile on one person's face,

17:26.212 --> 17:27.839
then it's worth it, I think.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.466
And who wants a fancy chain restaurant

17:29.549 --> 17:30.925
-on that corner, anyway?
-Me!

17:31.009 --> 17:32.927
-Sorry. Sorry. I don't.
-Thank you.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.721
I yield the rest of my time.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.806
There's no time...
Never mind.

17:36.890 --> 17:37.974
-That was great.
-Nice. -Good job, Mom.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.142
-Way to go.
-CYNTHIA: Thank you,

17:39.225 --> 17:41.728
Linda.
That was totally unnecessary.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.021
Can we vote now?

17:43.104 --> 17:45.190
Yes, we can.
On the matter

17:45.273 --> 17:47.192
of the trash can decorating resolution...

17:47.275 --> 17:48.860
-(door opens)
-Oh.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.029
Hello. Welcome.
Oh.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.030
-(door closes)
-Hi there. This cou...

17:53.114 --> 17:54.616
Wow.
This is a record crowd.

17:54.699 --> 17:57.118
Look, they're coming.
It's working.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.204
Okay.
Um, back to the voting.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.331
-But before you do...
-Oh, come on.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.999
...let's look at all these people, huh?

18:03.083 --> 18:05.460
They're here 'cause they love
the trash can thing.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.088
I was told there would be
free moving boxes?

18:08.171 --> 18:10.382
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you
love that trash can?

18:10.465 --> 18:13.051
The one on Harbor Road?
That gets decorated sometimes?

18:13.134 --> 18:14.928
I mean, sure.
I guess.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.805
She loves the can!

18:16.888 --> 18:18.807
And I'm assuming all these people vote.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.016
Tell me you all vote.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.851
-Uh, all the time.
-I love to vote.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.853
-It's been a while, to be honest.
-Okay, okay.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.022
And you city council members,
you all get voted in?

18:26.106 --> 18:27.982
Or is this a monarch system?

18:28.066 --> 18:30.235
Hey, wait.
According to the signs around town,

18:30.318 --> 18:32.153
an election is coming up pretty soon, eh?

18:32.237 --> 18:34.698
Yes.
We're all up for reelection next month.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.575
Vote Rockway!

18:37.659 --> 18:39.202
Uh-huh.
And is there a big turnout

18:39.285 --> 18:40.995
for a city council election?

18:41.079 --> 18:43.123
(chuckles): Oh, God, no.
I think each of us

18:43.206 --> 18:45.166
won by a couple votes?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.335
So you'd probably want
to listen to this crowd

18:47.419 --> 18:50.630
of several trash can
decorating-loving voters, then.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.466
-Right, huge crowd of voters?
-I mean, yeah, sure.

18:53.550 --> 18:56.594
That trash can is fun.
So are moving boxes.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.347
-Are we gonna be getting those now or...
-Shush, shush, shush.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.849
You kids are so smart.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.475
So, before you vote

19:02.559 --> 19:05.770
to never have any decorations
on any trash cans ever,

19:05.854 --> 19:07.480
maybe ask yourselves this:

19:07.564 --> 19:09.774
do you want to stay in office or not?

19:09.858 --> 19:11.484
Ha!
Nice try.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.361
Can we get back to the voting
on this thing?

19:13.445 --> 19:16.489
-Yes. Heather?
-I...

19:16.573 --> 19:20.285
uh... always like
to keep my constituents happy.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.038
So I-I'm on Team Fun Trash Can.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.165
I vote against the resolution.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.708
-Ah? Ah?
-What?!

19:26.791 --> 19:28.543
Franklin, how are you voting?

19:28.626 --> 19:31.546
I vote for the resolution
against the fun trash can.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.548
I don't really like fun.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.342
One yes, one no.
Tom?

19:35.425 --> 19:37.552
Bring it home, honey.
Bring it home.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.804
-Uh...
-Tom?

19:39.888 --> 19:43.141
I mean, fun trash cans <i>are</i> fun.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.060
-What?!
-Uh, I'm all mixed-up.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.269
I don't know what to do.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.188
But I've got to trust my instincts

19:48.271 --> 19:49.564
and let go of regret.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.441
I vote against the resolution,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.068
<i>with</i> the fun trash can.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.111
And I'm getting that 311 tattoo!

19:55.195 --> 19:57.530
No!
You killed our Pretzel Kingdom!

19:57.614 --> 19:59.199
I'm sorry!
I love you.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.700
The resolution fails.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.619
And I retroactively vote with the winners.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.954
Reelect Franklin Wilmington.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.040
Oh, my God, what?
We won. We won!

20:07.123 --> 20:09.459
-Ugh! Come on, Tom, let's go.
-To the tattoo parlor?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.419
I don't know. Maybe.
We'll talk about it.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.089
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.
This is the best gift.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.715
-We nailed it.
-(Linda groaning)

20:15.799 --> 20:16.966
(grunts)
Congratulations, Lin.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.511
I love my fun, trashy family.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.304
This gift is also your card, by the way.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.515
So, is whoever posted that message

20:23.598 --> 20:25.642
gonna give us free moving boxes or...

20:25.725 --> 20:28.687
Dad, we probably have some boxes
at the restaurant, right?

20:28.770 --> 20:32.107
Uh, I mean, they might have
some tomatoes in them, but sure.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.441
I'll take whatever you got, man.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.777
(gasps) Oh, my God.
Are you the cucumber guy?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.696
(chuckles)
Yes, I guess that's me.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.156
I-I can't believe I'm meeting you. Uh,

20:40.240 --> 20:42.117
y-you haven't been posting.
Is everything okay?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.993
Oh, I've been busy 'cause we're moving,

20:44.077 --> 20:46.329
but the cucumber's still going strong.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.456
Geez.
I hope you post a few more pictures.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.417
Well, you can come by
and see it if you want.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.086
Really? Oh, wow.
Uh, can I bring someone?

20:53.169 --> 20:54.379
Sure.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.631
Teddy?
You're not gonna believe this.

20:56.715 --> 20:59.050
<i>You're going</i>
<i>to the cucumber guy's basement.</i>

20:59.134 --> 21:00.844
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>What? What?!</i>
