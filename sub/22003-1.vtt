09:43.625 --> 09:45.792
You know 'cause of...
'Cause of the nails.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.458
-Would you stop talking?
It's not what this is about.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.625
-My arms are burning!
-Okay, yeah, okay!

09:50.667 --> 09:52.792
That's 'cause you're weak,
Judas.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.959
Strength. Jesus strength.
-[Lucas]: Still doesn't make
sense.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.166
-You know what else was hard?
Speaking of Jesus.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.834
Being Jesus was hard and he did
a damn good job of it.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.000
Imagine having your birthday on
Christmas?

10:03.041 --> 10:05.250
You're excited it's
Christmas day...

10:05.291 --> 10:07.667
But it's your birthday.
Everywhere he went...

10:07.709 --> 10:11.583
Merry Christmas Jesus.
How about Happy Birthday Jesus?

10:11.625 --> 10:13.542
No, he never got that.

10:13.583 --> 10:16.709
It was Merry Christmas, Merry
Christmas, Merry Christmas,
that's hard.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.834
Take all the stuff you had with
Miss Galka and chuck it.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.792
'Cause her Five Mark system is
done.

10:21.834 --> 10:24.709
Now we're going with my Five
Mark system and it's simple.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.917
You get five marks for being
great at something...

10:26.959 --> 10:30.375
You get three if you're good and
you get zero if you suck at it.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.291
Jesus will get five out of
five...

10:32.333 --> 10:36.542
If Jesus was in this class
he'd get whatever he wants,
'cause he's Jesus.

10:36.583 --> 10:39.208
And I don't want to deal with
his mom and dad coming in
here saying...

10:39.250 --> 10:41.667
Do you know who that is?
That's my son, Jesus.

10:41.709 --> 10:46.083
Six out of five Mr. Christ.
Six out of five.

10:46.125 --> 10:49.750
Nice job. Terrible.
-[♪ Music]

10:49.792 --> 10:51.959
-[Girls talking amongst
themselves]

10:52.000 --> 10:54.625
-Hey! What is up with my
girl crew?

10:54.667 --> 10:58.625
What's up squad?
-Um...We're fine, Miss Corcoran.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.250
-Cool. Um, listen, I get it.

11:01.291 --> 11:04.709
And you girls were absolutely
right. Even though we were
counsellors together,

11:04.750 --> 11:08.875
we have got to keep this best
friendship under wraps for
optics sake.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.417
Okay? Chicks are jealous!

11:11.458 --> 11:15.583
Um, but...We can still be
besties privately.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.625
No bracelets.
Yes bracelets!

11:18.667 --> 11:21.291
I'm secretly wearing them in my
pocket of my pants...

11:21.333 --> 11:24.083
That have stretch fabric!
[Laughs]

11:24.125 --> 11:26.041
Who cares!?
[Laughs]

11:26.083 --> 11:29.583
So, what is everybody up to
tonight? What are we sayin'?
What are we doin'?

11:29.625 --> 11:32.500
-Miss Corcoran, we can't be
besties with you anymore.

11:32.542 --> 11:36.583
-What? Why not?
-Because you're our teacher.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.125
Sure, we had the most insane
time working together this
summer,

11:39.166 --> 11:41.333
but we're not at camp anymore.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.792
-Which means we probably
shouldn't be hanging out,

11:43.834 --> 11:46.792
or like, going to the Kanawak
Girls' reunion together.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.375
-There's a reunion?
-You didn't know?

11:51.417 --> 11:53.834
-Probably better that way.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.125
-Goodbye Miss Corcoran.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.125
-But...We don't...

11:59.166 --> 12:03.250
God...You know what?
I don't need you!

12:03.291 --> 12:05.834
I don't need any of you.
-[Girls giggle]

12:05.875 --> 12:10.166
-What am I doing?
The sisterhood's forever.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.625
Wait! Wait!

12:12.667 --> 12:17.542
I do need you! I miss you
already. Don't go.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.709
Well, look who it is.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.625
-This is precisely what we
talked about.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.041
If you're too soft on them,
they will reoffend.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.375
Note. Hand. Now.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.625
Oh, roughhousing.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.875
Remember what we talked about.
You need to break him.
Get in there.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.875
-[Alex]: Excuse me?
-I got this.

12:34.917 --> 12:37.792
-The stare down...
It's a good opener.
-Alex, listen up!

12:41.375 --> 12:44.542
Don't do it again.
-Fine.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.291
-Look what I found.
-Great, thanks.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.458
-Now get outta here.
-That'll teach ya.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.667
-No, no, no, no.
Hold the weddin'.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.750
You listen to me and
you listen good.

12:55.792 --> 12:59.166
If you're in here for
roughhousing again, I will show
you a house that's really rough.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.333
Do you understand?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.625
Oh, you think this is funny,
do you? Ha.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.792
Let me tell you something,
this is no joke.

13:05.834 --> 13:09.709
My house of pain is open for
business and I would love to
make you jump around.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.458
Jump, jump. Different bands,
but you get the idea.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.417
Do I make myself clear?
Is that what you want?

13:14.458 --> 13:17.959
-No, no thanks...
-Didn't think so! Detention
for a month, get!

13:21.625 --> 13:23.583
And that's how you discipline.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.291
-Pshhoooo.
-[Robert]: Gerry.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.000
-Yeah?
-Kyle, Dwane and Sunita,

13:29.041 --> 13:31.250
have been exceptional
students for years. Agreed?
-Yeah.

13:31.291 --> 13:35.917
-So, what is this I'm hearing
about them suddenly being
terrified of failing...

13:35.959 --> 13:37.834
Gym?

13:37.875 --> 13:40.041
-Okay, Phys Ed. We call it
Phys Ed first of all.
-Whatever.

13:40.083 --> 13:43.625
-Look, the fact that those three
had a 90 average with Bobbi
all these years is ridiculous.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.792
Just a pure eye test
shows their gonna fail.

13:45.834 --> 13:47.709
-That's not how it works
in Gym anymore.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.875
You don't award marks just
based on athletic ability.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.333
-Please stop calling it Gym,
it's disrespectful.

13:52.375 --> 13:54.542
It's Phys Ed or Physical
Education, thank you.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.625
And secondly...Hey, Stephan.
Come here, a little experiment.

13:57.667 --> 14:00.542
What's eleven times twelve?
-Ahh...

14:00.583 --> 14:02.750
It's hard to do without a
calculator.
-[Gerry]: Yeah.

14:02.792 --> 14:04.959
-But, I know it's gonna
be a big number.
-[Gerry]: Yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.458
You see? Giving those three
a 90 in Phys Ed is like giving
Stephan, here, a 90 in math.

14:09.500 --> 14:13.291
Just 'cause he tried or thought
about the answer and his shirt
was tucked in.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.667
-I'll take it.
-No, no. No.

14:15.709 --> 14:17.709
-[Gerry]: Go.
-Not the same thing and
you know it.

14:17.750 --> 14:20.959
-It is, you don't get nineties
in Phys Ed 'cause you tried
to bounce a ball.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.625
Or you knew the weight of a
ball. What are we teaching
these kids by doing that?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.333
Are we starting to reward
inferiority?

14:27.375 --> 14:29.291
Oh, speak of the devil!
Hi, Sunita.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.458
-Um, excuse me, sir. I was
wondering if you could
tutor me in basketball?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.667
-Yeah, no, I don't tutor in
Phys Ed.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.667
That's not...That's not a
subject you get tutoring.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.083
-Isn't there? 'Cause
what I'm hearing is...

14:39.125 --> 14:43.709
A student asking for help in a
course that you teach them.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.250
-Okay, so then you're admitting
that you need help in Phys Ed?
-Yes.

14:47.291 --> 14:50.333
-Yeah, so I guess someone that
needs help in Phys Education

14:50.375 --> 14:54.792
probably should never have had a
96 in Physical Education, right?
-Yeah.

14:54.834 --> 14:58.125
-Yeah, 'cause when it comes
to basketball or any sport
you really are...

14:58.166 --> 15:00.083
-Gar...bage?
-[Robert gasps]

15:00.125 --> 15:03.750
-Okay, garbage, that's harsh.
But garbage, you said it, so...

15:03.792 --> 15:05.917
-But, I really want to stop
being garbage.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.875
-So, then I will tutor you...
As crazy as that sounds...

15:08.917 --> 15:11.333
In Physical Education.
-There you go.

15:11.375 --> 15:15.333
Can't believe I'm saying this,
but, ah, great job.
-Okay.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.667

-There you go.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.750

15:21.792 --> 15:23.917
-Let's try it again, see if
we can get it this time.

15:23.959 --> 15:26.625
Try to score, get by me. Okay.
That's what I thought.
-[Sunita]: Okay.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.792
-[Ball crashes into bleachers]
-[Gerry]: Okay.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.792
-[Sunita]: Oh, shoot!
-[Gerry]: Yup. [Sighs]

15:31.834 --> 15:34.500
Okay Sunita, how about
we call it a day.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.667
-But, there's still fifteen
minutes left.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.583
Can we please work on some
layups next?

15:38.625 --> 15:41.291
-What's the point, Sunita?
You're not, you're not gettin'
this.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.500
This is just too hard for you...
What?

15:43.542 --> 15:46.291
-We heard you were tutoring
basketball, sir?

15:46.333 --> 15:48.792
-Come on, who's talking
about this?

15:48.834 --> 15:50.834
Yes, okay. Fine.
Go get changed.

15:50.875 --> 15:53.792
But I'm only doing this for
fifteen more minutes and
I'm not staying a minute later.

15:53.834 --> 15:56.959
-I can't right now. I'm LARPing
in five minutes.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.333
-Oh.
-But, I could do tomorrow
after school.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.625
-I can do lunch hours every day!
But I have chemistry club
after school.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.333
-Yeah, lunch hours,
not a chance...

16:05.375 --> 16:07.709
'Cause I like to have a little
nap, like most teachers.

16:07.750 --> 16:11.500
I'm not doin' this tomorrow.
This is a one day a week thing.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.667
-Is this where we sign up
for the Gym tutoring?

16:13.709 --> 16:15.583
Dibs on Thursdays.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.709

not called Gym.

I can't do this guys.

16:21.709 --> 16:25.166
Okay? I can't make you athletes.
You're born an athlete.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.709

17:35.792 --> 17:38.750
I lied right to your faces.
I apologize, but...

17:40.208 --> 17:42.959
Sometimes you're not good
at stuff, it doesn't matter
how hard you try,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.667
or the effort you're puttin' in,
you're just not good at it.

17:45.709 --> 17:48.667
You're still gonna fail.
And right now...

17:48.709 --> 17:50.583
You're failing.

17:50.625 --> 17:53.959
So, I can't have you scrimmage,
when we play games.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.792
-How will we get a
good mark then?

17:56.834 --> 17:58.959
-Good question, just 'cause
you're not good at sports

17:59.000 --> 18:01.250
doesn't mean you can't
be involved in sports.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.792
Sunita, you're gonna be a
doctor. Well, what happens
in Phys Ed?

18:03.834 --> 18:07.667
People get hurt, so I need
you every day, to be my
First Aid specialist.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.834
If any thing goes wrong with
any students, you jump in.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.000
You're not gonna play,
you're not gonna touch anything.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.208
Just sit there, in case
someone gets hurt.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.834

I need a scorekeeper every
scrimmage.

-Awesome!
-Dwayne, I know you're on
the debating team.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.750
Start learning all the
rules of all the sports

18:22.792 --> 18:24.917
'cause every time we play,
you're gonna be my referee.

18:24.959 --> 18:27.750
-What about me, sir?
-[Clears throat]: Yeah.

18:27.792 --> 18:31.125
Yeah, Paul, Stanley like,
I don't know what to say guys.

18:31.166 --> 18:34.750
You're just bad at everything.
So, here's what you're gonna do.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.625
You've got two jobs...
You can be fans...

18:37.667 --> 18:40.959

pants back together when
I take 'em off.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.875
[Gerry claps]: Alright?
Everybody's got a job now.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.750

Phys Ed mark back where
they want it.

-I've been lookin' for you.
-Aren't you supposed to
be in detention?

19:05.834 --> 19:09.125
-My stepmom said I didn't
have to go.
-Oh, you're stepmom...

19:09.166 --> 19:11.667
Ha, said you don't have to go to
detention?

19:11.709 --> 19:13.834
-Yeah. She, ah, actually wants a
word with you.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.083
-Well guess what? I'd like a
word with her too.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.250
Because it would be a good
chance to remind her...

19:18.291 --> 19:21.750
That the stepmom's of the
