all dogs know each other

with poodles.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.443
No. Look, I want
to keep Ollie, too,

every night.

{\an1}Well, you heard
what Raymundo said.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.494
{\an1}He'll never give Ollie
a chance.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.331
There's no other dog anywhere
like Ollie.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.750
If only we could show him that.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.002
Yeah! Like if there was
some kind of

we could put him in.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.966
Ollie would
totally win

and Raymundo would have
to give him props.

if we entered him

{\an1}You know, I could've
probably told you

I guess we're just going to have
to show Ollie to Raymundo

10:46.562 --> 10:48.189
(<i> sneezes</i> )

10:48.272 --> 10:50.775
See ya, Ollie.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.736
Don't be sad, my new friends.

10:53.819 --> 10:57.990
Mommy takes me to the beach
every Tuesday.

10:58.074 --> 11:04.538
You're welcome to come find me
and <i> play</i> with me.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.123
Bye-bye now.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.127
(<i> tires squealing</i> )

11:11.170 --> 11:12.963
(<i> whimpering</i> )

11:13.047 --> 11:14.590
{\an1}Hey...

11:14.673 --> 11:18.594
if you ever see my puppy,
tell him I said, "Hi."

11:19.428 --> 11:21.430
Dude, so bogus.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.183
Well, at least we know
where to find him every Tuesday.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.519
And who knows...

11:26.602 --> 11:28.979
maybe we'll even get
an Ollie of our own soon.

11:29.063 --> 11:29.939
Really? Sweet.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.399
{\an3}Yeah.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.399
Cool.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.692
{\an1}Yeah.

11:32.775 --> 11:36.987
That woman seemed kind of odd,
though, don't you think?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.280
Yeah, Raymundo.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.117
{\an1}In fact, it almost looked
like a case of...

11:41.200 --> 11:43.494
poodle mind control.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.621
Poodle mind control?

11:45.704 --> 11:47.373
(<i> yelling</i> )

11:47.456 --> 11:50.501
(<i> yelling continues</i> )

11:57.258 --> 11:58.300
{\an8}(<i> zapping</i> )

11:58.384 --> 12:00.636
{\an8}(<i> tumbling</i> )

12:00.719 --> 12:01.762
{\an8}(<i> metal clanking</i> )

12:01.846 --> 12:03.472
{\an8}(<i> metal creaking</i> )

12:03.556 --> 12:06.308
{\an8}(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

12:06.392 --> 12:07.810
{\an8}(<i> metal clanking</i> )

12:07.893 --> 12:09.812
{\an8}(<i> zapping</i> )

12:09.895 --> 12:11.397
{\an8}Go, Zagron!

12:12.064 --> 12:15.651
{\an8}(<i> thudding</i> )

12:18.529 --> 12:22.450
{\an8}Oh, the enemies are vanquished!

12:22.533 --> 12:24.910
{\an8}Go, Zagron, go, Zagron.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.996
{\an8}It's your birthday.
It's your birthday.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.873
{\an8}(<i> buzzer sounding</i> )

12:28.956 --> 12:29.832
Oh, no.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.418
Not Oliver, the Rovanator.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.712
Young gully, prepare
to be rovanated.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.881
(<i> fiendish laughter</i> )

12:36.964 --> 12:39.091
No!

12:39.175 --> 12:40.301
(<i> screaming</i> )

12:40.384 --> 12:41.177
Oh, what? Oh, oh.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.179
Just a...

12:43.262 --> 12:44.722
Just a bad dream.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.059
{\an5}Ah.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.059
{\an1}Mother:
Sammy...

12:49.143 --> 12:50.352
wake up.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.353
Your little friends are here
to play.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.647
Tell them I can't.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.065
{\an1}Otto:
It's okay, Mrs. D.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.110
We've already seen Sam
in his jammies.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.195
Come on, Squid.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.446
The waves are waiting.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.572
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Oh.

13:01.655 --> 13:02.698
You know what?

13:02.781 --> 13:03.824
I'd love to go

13:03.908 --> 13:06.118
but I have some
stuff I need to do.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.871
{\an3}Whoa!

13:08.954 --> 13:12.249
"Robotic Organized Battle
of Technical Skills."

13:12.333 --> 13:15.044
Geez, they might as
well call it Nerd Fest

13:15.127 --> 13:16.295
and make it easier
for everybody.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.422
(<i> laughter</i> )

13:18.506 --> 13:19.715
Hey, come on, Otto.

13:19.798 --> 13:20.674
{\an3}Lay off.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.675
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

13:21.759 --> 13:22.760
Hey, I can't help it

13:22.843 --> 13:24.136
{\an1}if he wants to do some dumb
robot thing.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.679
It's not dumb.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.390
Each team designs
their own robot

13:28.474 --> 13:29.683
with a special weapon.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.893
And they battle
by remote control.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.771
I enter every year,
but every year

13:33.854 --> 13:36.482
{\an5}Oliver and his
genius team always
seems to win.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.525
I really want to go for it
this time.

13:37.608 --> 13:40.486
Yeah. Sounds like
a real blast.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.695
Can we surf now?

13:41.779 --> 13:42.863
Sure thing.

13:42.947 --> 13:45.366
After Sam shows
us his robot.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.832
I want you to meet--

13:53.916 --> 13:55.834
Zagron!

13:57.002 --> 14:00.506
Just wait until you see
what he can do.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.841
(<i> metal creaking</i> )

14:07.555 --> 14:09.848
(<i> thudding</i> )

14:12.351 --> 14:15.729
Oh, scary!

14:15.813 --> 14:17.773
It's still in the
planning stages.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.275
Then maybe you should <i> plan</i>
a new name.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.611
Like Wevot.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.239
(<i> laughs</i> )

14:29.743 --> 14:32.288
If I connect
the computer check in...

14:32.371 --> 14:33.122
{\an5}And that...

14:32.371 --> 14:33.122
(<i> Sam muttering to himself</i> )

14:33.205 --> 14:35.207
In!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.459
{\an1}Maybe you should tell
your little friend

14:37.543 --> 14:40.421
that the goalie's job is
to try and stop the puck.

14:40.504 --> 14:41.463
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

14:41.547 --> 14:43.757
Later, dorks.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.467
What gives, Sammo?

14:45.551 --> 14:46.302
You could have blocked it clean.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.262
Sorry.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.805
I got kind of distracted.

14:49.888 --> 14:52.224
I got to figure out
what to do with Zagron.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.475
{\an3}Yeah?

14:53.559 --> 14:55.144
{\an5}We're trying
to win a
hockey game.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.147
Maybe we should have had <i> Zagron</i>
play goalie for us instead.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.149
Oliver: It wouldn't
have helped you.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.360
Hey, Oliver.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.863
I thought you'd like to see
my engineering masterpiece

15:05.946 --> 15:07.656
before it pounds you into
the ground in public defeat.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.826
This is the Rovanator!

15:10.909 --> 15:12.828
(<i> computer voice</i> ):
Hello, Loser.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.788
Whoa, how did he know?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.665
I haven't lost yet.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.625
Only a matter of time.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.753
Is this your robattle crew?

15:20.836 --> 15:22.004
No way.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.797
{\an5}Because if
you <i> were</i>
helping out

15:23.881 --> 15:25.966
I'd have to program
the Rovanator to say

15:26.050 --> 15:27.301
"Losers."

15:27.384 --> 15:28.761
Nobody calls <i> me</i> a loser!

15:28.844 --> 15:29.803
And if we we're on Sam's crew

15:29.887 --> 15:33.098
we'd show you brainiacs
how it's done.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.850
I'd like to
see you try.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.060
Oh, really?

15:36.143 --> 15:36.685
Then count me in.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.937
Really? You mean it?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.774
{\an1}Reggie and Twist are
with me, too. Right, guys?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.359
Right!

15:43.442 --> 15:47.112
Time to get Zagron rocking!

15:48.489 --> 15:51.325
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

15:56.664 --> 16:00.042
{\an1}Dude, Zagron's moves are
severely weak.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.796
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

16:04.588 --> 16:05.047
(<i> metal screeching</i> )

16:07.007 --> 16:07.800
(<i> metal screeching</i> )

16:07.883 --> 16:11.720
Zagron's been Otto-sized!

16:11.804 --> 16:14.765
Yeah! Check out
the radical moves.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.727
(<i> screeching</i> )

16:18.811 --> 16:20.604
Zagron's going to need eyes
in the back of his head

16:20.688 --> 16:23.273
to keep up with me.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.860
(<i> screeching</i> )

16:32.616 --> 16:35.536
(<i> swivel whirring</i> )

16:35.619 --> 16:37.287
{\an5}Sam:
This is awesome!

16:37.371 --> 16:38.580
{\an5}I can track the Rovanator
from all angles.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.249
Great idea, Twist!

16:40.332 --> 16:42.209
{\an1}I know.

16:42.292 --> 16:42.835
I think it's my first.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.837
We got the speed.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.296
We got the video target.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.506
All we need is the...

16:47.589 --> 16:49.425
(<i> electric whirring</i> )

16:49.508 --> 16:51.760
...weapon.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.848
Let's get ready to robattle!

16:55.931 --> 17:00.060
(<i> metal clanking</i> )

17:00.936 --> 17:03.564
(<i> electronic buzzing</i> )

17:03.647 --> 17:05.315
(<i> metal thudding</i> )

17:05.398 --> 17:07.734
Huh?

17:07.818 --> 17:08.944
(<i> catching breath</i> )

17:09.028 --> 17:10.319
Safe.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.320
Oh.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.948
Busted.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.532
Woo-hoo!

17:14.616 --> 17:19.163
Zagron, I think
this is going to be the year!

17:22.708 --> 17:27.378
(<i> cheering</i> )

17:33.802 --> 17:34.970
Oh, I'm so nervous.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.764
I just can't bare
to watch.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.724
Come on, Sammy.

17:38.807 --> 17:39.725
Uh, just relax.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.684
Get into it.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.727
Have a good time.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.646
Take it to the junkyard,
baby!

17:44.730 --> 17:47.232
My boy's going to kick
some ro-butt!

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
Oh, my.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.652
Did that come
out of me?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.821
(<i> thudding</i> )

17:52.905 --> 17:54.156
(<i> whirring</i> )

17:54.239 --> 17:55.574
(<i> electronic pulsing</i> )

17:55.657 --> 18:00.287
(<i> thudding</i> )

18:11.131 --> 18:14.343
No! No! No!

18:14.426 --> 18:17.930
There, there, Murphy-Boo,
you put up a good fight.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.185
(<i> thudding</i> )

18:23.268 --> 18:24.853
(<i> electronic buzzing</i> )

18:24.937 --> 18:28.273
(<i> hinges creaking</i> )

18:32.069 --> 18:34.863
(<i> applause and cheering</i> )

18:34.947 --> 18:39.117
(<i> saw buzzing</i> )

18:39.201 --> 18:40.327
{\an1}All right!

18:40.410 --> 18:41.286
{\an5}They made the finals!

18:40.410 --> 18:41.286
(<i> buzzer ringing</i> )

18:41.370 --> 18:43.038
(<i> chanting</i> ):
Who's the man?

18:43.121 --> 18:45.290
Who's the man?
Who's the man?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.959
{\an3}Sammy is!

18:47.042 --> 18:47.626
Yeah, Sam!

18:47.709 --> 18:50.254
I can't believe it!

18:50.337 --> 18:52.089
{\an5}Announcer:
Ladies and Gentlemen,

18:52.172 --> 18:54.424
{\an5}a short break
before the ultimate battle--

18:54.508 --> 18:56.009
The Rovanator

18:56.093 --> 18:57.636
versus Zagron!

18:57.719 --> 19:00.222
It's you and me again,
in the finals, Dullard.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.057
Just like all the other times.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.016
Good luck.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.059
Thank you,
Oliver.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.060
You, too.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.728
(<i> rhythmic clapping</i> )

19:06.812 --> 19:09.147
Ladies and Gentlemen

19:09.231 --> 19:10.941
{\an5}the moment
you've all been waiting for.

19:11.024 --> 19:14.695
It's Rovanator versus Zagron

19:14.778 --> 19:16.113
in a fight to the finish.

19:16.196 --> 19:22.035
And... roll battle!

19:22.119 --> 19:24.371
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

19:24.454 --> 19:26.331
(<i> thudding</i> )

19:26.415 --> 19:27.583
(<i> metal creaking</i> )

19:27.666 --> 19:29.626
I can't look!

19:29.710 --> 19:30.919
Tell me when
it's over.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.506
(<i> buzzer sounding</i> )

19:38.260 --> 19:42.431
Oh! He almost
had me there.

19:42.514 --> 19:45.267
{\an1}You're going to have
to make the first move.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.228
You let me know
when you're thirsty, Zag.

19:48.312 --> 19:51.773
{\an5}Robots, take your places
for round two!

19:51.857 --> 19:52.816
(<i> buzzer sounds</i> )

19:52.900 --> 19:56.028
{\an1}Oh, boy!

19:56.111 --> 20:00.115
(<i> cheering</i> )

20:00.198 --> 20:04.786
(<i> thudding</i> )

20:16.882 --> 20:18.342
(<i> buzzer ringing</i> )

20:18.425 --> 20:20.552
Prepare for the next round!

20:20.636 --> 20:24.556
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

20:24.640 --> 20:27.392
Oh, man, it's hopeless.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.187
I better signal
Zagron's surrender.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.940
Sorry, pal.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.733
You can't give up now.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.818
You never do.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.320
Remember when we took you
snowboarding

20:38.403 --> 20:39.571
for the first time?

20:39.655 --> 20:40.489
You kept falling
and falling,

20:40.572 --> 20:42.783
but you always
got back up.

20:42.866 --> 20:43.867
Yeah, you always
do something lame,

20:43.951 --> 20:46.286
but that doesn't stop you.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.580
(<i> laughs</i> )

20:48.664 --> 20:49.915
Sorry.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.669
Well... maybe
I can't outsmart Oliver.

20:53.752 --> 20:54.836
But I can out-guts him!

20:54.920 --> 20:57.839
{\an5}All right!

20:54.920 --> 20:57.839
Oh, yeah!

20:57.923 --> 21:01.426
Let the games begin.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.302
(<i> cheering</i> )

21:06.098 --> 21:07.849
