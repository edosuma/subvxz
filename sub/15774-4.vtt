WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.480
Give me a wrench.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.445
- Porky!
- Huh?

00:06.564 --> 00:08.066
Oh, sorry, I was studying.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.434
Studying?

00:09.468 --> 00:11.536
[Stuttering] Yeah,
I went back to school.

00:11.570 --> 00:13.071
Oh, boy.

00:13.105 --> 00:16.036
I figured the catering business
can be such a roller coaster.

00:16.072 --> 00:17.731
It's good to keep your options open.

00:17.765 --> 00:20.283
Besides, I've always loved school.

00:20.317 --> 00:21.717
You know, for two people

00:21.751 --> 00:23.283
that spend a lot of time together,

00:23.317 --> 00:25.485
we really have nothing in common.

00:25.519 --> 00:27.292
Ah, that should do it.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.863
What were you fixing?

00:28.897 --> 00:32.897
Nothing. But women love
a guy who works on his car.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.766
Are those Bugs' gloves?

00:37.800 --> 00:39.906
Gotta protect my delicate hands.

00:39.940 --> 00:43.842
Women love a man with a soft touch.

00:43.877 --> 00:48.782
What you winkin' at?
Don't you wave at me!

00:48.817 --> 00:51.018
Well, most women.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.114
Daffy!

01:21.148 --> 01:23.583
- What's up?
- Where are my gloves?

01:23.618 --> 01:25.019
Oh, I washed them.

01:25.053 --> 01:26.453
Why would you wash them?!

01:26.488 --> 01:28.622
Because they were covered
in grease and oil.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.694
You're welcome!

01:32.729 --> 01:34.929
My gloves are dry clean only!

01:34.963 --> 01:37.831
- I said I was sorry.
- No, you didn't.

01:37.866 --> 01:41.804
Look, let's not split hairs.
Why do you even wear gloves?

01:41.838 --> 01:44.441
Because, I've always
worn them. It's who I am.

01:44.475 --> 01:47.544
Why do you wear that thing
around your neck?

01:55.321 --> 01:59.057
Grand mummy, one day when I'm grown,

01:59.091 --> 02:02.026
will you give me your pearls?

02:04.230 --> 02:06.698
I wear this for medical reasons.

02:06.733 --> 02:09.800
They've shrunk!

02:09.836 --> 02:13.472
You shrunk my gloves!

02:13.506 --> 02:16.775
But what would I expect
from someone named "Daffy"?

02:16.810 --> 02:18.510
What's that supposed to mean?!

02:18.545 --> 02:21.213
I got to have some gloves
in here somewhere.

02:21.248 --> 02:22.849
What's wrong with my name?

02:22.883 --> 02:25.551
Look it up.

02:25.585 --> 02:28.554
[Typing]

02:28.588 --> 02:30.823
"Daffy--adjective.

02:30.858 --> 02:35.294
Foolish, insane,
brainless, crazy."

02:35.328 --> 02:38.597
[Gasps] This explains so much!

02:38.631 --> 02:42.668
No wonder I've always been
treated with such disdain;

02:42.702 --> 02:45.804
why no one's given me
the respect I deserve!

02:45.838 --> 02:48.373
It certainly can't be
because of my manner

02:48.407 --> 02:50.307
or anything I've done.

02:50.342 --> 02:52.076
It's because of my name.

02:52.110 --> 02:54.945
I have to change my name!

02:57.949 --> 02:59.583
Good-bye, Daffy!

02:59.618 --> 03:00.985
Hello...

03:01.019 --> 03:04.922
Ah, well, I'll think of something.

03:04.957 --> 03:06.858
Do these gloves look weird?

03:06.892 --> 03:08.793
Daffy?

03:11.697 --> 03:14.399
How do you say "taco" in Spanish?

03:14.433 --> 03:15.934
Taco.

03:15.968 --> 03:18.470
Ta... co.

03:18.505 --> 03:21.641
How do you say, uh, burrito?

03:21.675 --> 03:23.976
- Burrito.
- What?!

03:24.010 --> 03:26.512
So Spanish and English
are the same? That's crazy.

03:26.546 --> 03:29.148
Ehh.

03:33.653 --> 03:37.189
I, uh, I think you push it.

03:37.224 --> 03:40.026
Hey, Bugs, where you been?

03:40.060 --> 03:41.727
I've been waiting a half an hour.

03:41.762 --> 03:43.530
I got lost.

03:43.564 --> 03:45.598
What do you mean you got lost?
You come here all the time.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.501
I know, uh, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

03:48.536 --> 03:51.104
Oh, you poor thing.
Let me get you a glass of water.

03:51.138 --> 03:52.972
Or, as they say in Spanish,

03:53.007 --> 03:57.043
a glass of water.

03:57.077 --> 03:59.545
Hola, senor Bugs.
Can I get you the usual?

03:59.580 --> 04:01.815
Huh? Oh, yeah, sure.

04:01.849 --> 04:04.651
The usual.
What's my usual?

04:04.685 --> 04:06.286
A personal carrot pizza.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.620
Carrot pizza?

04:07.655 --> 04:09.722
Who puts carrots on pizza?

04:09.757 --> 04:11.724
Are you ok?
You seem strange.

04:11.759 --> 04:13.493
I just don't feel like myself.

04:13.527 --> 04:15.428
I--I don't know what it is.

04:15.462 --> 04:19.464
Here you go, bun bun.
Where are your gloves?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.134
[Gasps] My gloves!

04:21.168 --> 04:24.337
I'm not myself
because I don't have my gloves!

04:24.371 --> 04:26.105
Oh. Well, I have
an extra pair in my purse

04:26.140 --> 04:27.674
if you want to borrow mine.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.375
What are these?

04:30.511 --> 04:32.045
Pearls.

04:32.079 --> 04:34.481
- Pretty, huh?
- I can't wear these!

04:34.515 --> 04:36.950
I've gotta get my gloves back.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.019
Ooh, maybe Daffy will want these.

04:39.053 --> 04:41.021
They'll match his necklace.

04:41.956 --> 04:43.557
Eh, can I help you?

04:43.591 --> 04:45.959
This isn't the parking lot.

04:45.994 --> 04:49.296
I've gotta get my gloves back.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.532
[Panting]

04:56.871 --> 04:58.572
These are all baby names.

04:58.606 --> 05:00.908
I don't want people
thinking I'm a baby.

05:00.942 --> 05:02.943
They're not just for babies.

05:02.977 --> 05:05.045
That's usually when
people get their names.

05:05.079 --> 05:08.315
Let me see.
What about John?

05:08.349 --> 05:10.517
John? John Duck?

05:10.551 --> 05:12.119
That sounds like jaundice!

05:12.153 --> 05:14.054
Like I'm all yellow and sickly.

05:14.089 --> 05:15.789
How about William?

05:15.824 --> 05:17.524
William? Willie?

05:17.558 --> 05:19.827
Silly-Willie-daffa-dillie?

05:19.861 --> 05:21.328
Who would say that?

05:21.362 --> 05:23.597
All the kids on the playground.

05:23.631 --> 05:26.100
What playground are you on?

05:26.134 --> 05:28.903
I don't know why
you're making such a big deal

05:28.937 --> 05:30.404
out of your name, anyway.

05:30.438 --> 05:32.539
[Scoffs] Easy for you to say!

05:32.574 --> 05:34.241
You don't know what it's like
to have your name

05:34.276 --> 05:37.745
be a source of ridicule
and embarrassment.

05:37.780 --> 05:41.047
You've got it easy!
Your name's Porky--

05:42.250 --> 05:44.151
Well, you'd make a good John.

05:44.185 --> 05:46.353
John pig.

05:46.387 --> 05:49.055
Strong.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.760
Oh, there's my political
science teacher.

05:53.794 --> 05:56.563
Professor Johnson!

05:56.597 --> 05:57.864
Professor.

05:57.898 --> 06:00.233
Professor Duck.

06:00.268 --> 06:02.135
You've got to respect that.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.911
I'm afraid we don't carry
white gloves for men anymore.

06:10.945 --> 06:12.179
What? Why?

06:12.213 --> 06:15.516
Well, because it's not the 1800s.

06:15.550 --> 06:17.084
But I need them!

06:17.118 --> 06:19.587
We can special order them,
but it might take a while.

06:19.621 --> 06:22.356
Do you have any other gloves?
I really need a pair of gloves!

06:22.390 --> 06:25.826
Well, it's summer, so we don't
have that many options.

06:25.861 --> 06:28.062
Just get me a pair of gloves!

06:31.300 --> 06:34.135
[Chuckles]

06:36.606 --> 06:40.009
Where are the fingers?

06:40.043 --> 06:42.611
It's all they had.

06:42.646 --> 06:45.648
Now, thanks to you, I'm this guy.

06:45.682 --> 06:47.917
Daffy, where's the remote?

06:47.952 --> 06:51.087
Daffy. Hello, Daffy!

06:51.121 --> 06:54.123
Ohoh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

06:54.158 --> 06:57.326
Because if you were,
my name's not Daffy.

06:57.361 --> 06:59.329
Check this out.

06:59.363 --> 07:00.797
You got a wallet?

07:00.831 --> 07:03.065
Not that. This.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.067
- Porky's credit card?
- What?

07:05.102 --> 07:07.503
No, not that. This.

07:07.537 --> 07:10.973
Professor Duck?

07:11.007 --> 07:12.674
I changed my name.

07:12.709 --> 07:15.111
Daffy, Professor is not a name.

07:15.145 --> 07:17.546
It's a title--
that you have to earn!

07:17.580 --> 07:19.748
I did earn it.
By going down to the courthouse

07:19.783 --> 07:21.650
and paying 14 bucks.

07:21.685 --> 07:24.653
Well, I used Porky's credit
card. So what do you think?

07:26.189 --> 07:28.291
I think I'm gonna get a tattoo.

07:28.325 --> 07:29.559
What? Why?

07:29.593 --> 07:33.263
I don't know.
I just feel like it.

07:33.297 --> 07:35.565
Sorry if that hurts.

07:35.599 --> 07:38.100
I didn't know you started.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.291
Thanks for driving me to class.

07:45.411 --> 07:47.936
I didn't know how I was going to
get the cake there in one piece.

07:47.970 --> 07:49.170
Who's it for?

07:49.205 --> 07:50.505
My teacher.

07:50.539 --> 07:52.673
Each tier represents
a branch of government.

07:52.708 --> 07:55.609
This tier represents
the legislative branch,

07:55.643 --> 07:57.611
this tier is executive branch,

07:57.645 --> 08:00.447
and this is the judiciary branch.

08:00.481 --> 08:05.018
Again. We have
nothing in common.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.856
Professor Johnson!

08:09.890 --> 08:12.459
I've got a surprise for you.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.561
Is it another cake
that somehow represents

08:14.596 --> 08:16.897
whatever we talked about
in the last class?

08:16.932 --> 08:19.833
The nine gumdrops
are the supreme court justices.

08:19.868 --> 08:21.301
Even their gavels are edible.

08:21.336 --> 08:22.736
Ooh, I better get inside

08:22.770 --> 08:25.172
before someone gets the
seat closest to your desk.

08:25.206 --> 08:27.574
Oh, thanks for the ride, Professor!

08:30.077 --> 08:33.113
- You're a Professor.
- That's what they call me.

08:33.147 --> 08:35.347
How would you
like to take over my class?

08:35.381 --> 08:37.582
- What?
- That pig is driving me crazy.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.251
Please! There are only
a few classes left.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.455
All you've got to do
is follow the lesson plan.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.490
You'll figure it out.
You're a Professor.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.526
Professor Johnson!

08:46.560 --> 08:49.863
Don't forget about our pop quiz today!

08:49.897 --> 08:51.698
I'm begging you.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.373
Beat it.
You're in my chair.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.876
- But I was just--
- Leaving.

09:05.612 --> 09:10.016
Ain't nobody heard
of service around here?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.650
Hey, senor Bunny!

09:11.685 --> 09:13.452
What's with the shouting
and the double negatives?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.887
Cool it, pops.

09:14.921 --> 09:16.955
I'm just blowing off some steam.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.957
Pops?! Who you calling pops?

09:18.991 --> 09:20.992
Just bring me a slice, old man.

09:21.026 --> 09:22.293
I'm not bringing you anything.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.961
You know what, get out of here.

09:23.996 --> 09:27.098
I reserve the right
to refuse service to anybody.

09:27.133 --> 09:32.070
I don't want your stupid pizza anyway!

09:32.104 --> 09:35.674
Hey, watch where you're a'goin'!

09:35.708 --> 09:37.643
Or what?

09:37.677 --> 09:38.944
Uh... nthin'.

09:38.979 --> 09:42.715
Anyone else?

09:44.318 --> 09:46.519
That's what I thought!

09:49.490 --> 09:51.224
[Door opens]

09:51.259 --> 09:53.727
Huh? What?

09:55.830 --> 09:59.567
All right, class, settle down.

09:59.601 --> 10:00.901
[Groaning]

10:00.936 --> 10:03.003
My name is...

10:03.038 --> 10:05.473
Professor Duck.

10:05.507 --> 10:07.642
That doesn't look right.

10:07.676 --> 10:10.044
Ah, one "F", two "S".

10:10.079 --> 10:12.313
That's weird.
I've got to memorize this.

10:12.348 --> 10:15.483
Professor Johnson has asked me
to take over your class.

10:15.517 --> 10:18.319
So for the next few weeks,
I will be your guide

10:18.353 --> 10:24.926
as we journey to a wonderful
place known as...

10:24.960 --> 10:27.829
Political science.

10:27.863 --> 10:31.066
No, you may not use the restroom.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.168
Let's see what we're learning today.

10:33.202 --> 10:34.736
What are you doing?!

10:34.771 --> 10:36.371
I'm teaching your class!

10:36.406 --> 10:37.773
You're not a teacher.

10:37.807 --> 10:41.343
Excuse us for a moment.

10:41.377 --> 10:43.411
Now just because you changed your name

10:43.446 --> 10:44.913
doesn't make you a Professor.

10:44.947 --> 10:47.015
Then why do I have
a classroom full of students

10:47.049 --> 10:49.551
waiting for me to go back
in there and teach them?

10:49.585 --> 10:51.719
Because I shouted your name
across the parking lot

10:51.754 --> 10:54.488
and my teacher must have thought
you were a real Professor.

10:54.523 --> 10:57.491
- Professor.
- Professor.

10:57.525 --> 10:59.426
Please don't blow this for me!

10:59.460 --> 11:03.697
You don't understand. Things like
this don't happen to Daffy Duck.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.366
But Professor Duck has a chalkboard.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.368
Elbow patches!

11:08.403 --> 11:10.437
Glasses!

11:10.471 --> 11:13.741
I don't know.
It's unethical.

11:13.775 --> 11:15.509
- I'll give you an "A".
- Deal.

11:16.645 --> 11:20.782
I can't see out of these things.

11:20.816 --> 11:23.284
[Revving motor]

11:23.318 --> 11:25.253
I'll take it!

11:25.287 --> 11:27.522
[Tires squealing]

11:46.610 --> 11:49.345
Meep meep!

11:52.783 --> 11:55.519
Meep meep!

12:09.299 --> 12:10.878
All right, class.

12:10.998 --> 12:14.937
Today we'll be focusing
on the executive branch,

12:14.971 --> 12:18.273
specifically the presidential cabinet.

12:18.308 --> 12:20.743
Now, as we all know,

12:20.777 --> 12:23.780
the president
is a very important person.

12:23.814 --> 12:26.716
So it would only be fitting
that his cabinet

12:26.751 --> 12:30.220
would be made of very expensive wood.

12:30.254 --> 12:32.956
Probably a mahogany or a cedar.

12:32.991 --> 12:34.358
Definitely not pine.

12:34.392 --> 12:37.495
Pine would be more
for a vice president cabinet.

12:37.529 --> 12:41.632
Now, what's the president
got in there?

12:41.667 --> 12:45.670
This is one of the greatest mysteries

12:45.704 --> 12:48.739
in all of political science.

12:48.774 --> 12:51.910
And though it remains unsolved,

12:51.944 --> 12:54.912
I have a theory!

12:54.947 --> 12:57.181
It's not a cabinet at all.
It's a portal.

12:57.216 --> 12:59.651
A portal that transports the president

12:59.685 --> 13:02.053
wherever he wants to go.

13:02.087 --> 13:03.788
The grocery store, the gym,

13:03.822 --> 13:06.424
maybe his favorite
frozen yogurt place.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.660
[Engine revving]

13:08.694 --> 13:11.563
What on earth is going on out there?!

13:11.598 --> 13:14.633
[Tires squealing]

13:18.138 --> 13:20.039
What has gotten into him?

13:20.074 --> 13:22.776
Hey, hey! Get out of here!

13:22.810 --> 13:25.178
My kids are trying to learn!

13:25.213 --> 13:29.616
You want to throw your life
away? That's your prerogative!

13:36.290 --> 13:38.959
That's what happens
when you don't stay in school.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.155
Thanks for letting me
do my laundry over here, mom.

13:49.252 --> 13:52.488
Don't they have a washer/dryer
at your apartment building?

13:52.522 --> 13:53.856
They do, but it takes coins.

13:53.890 --> 13:56.058
And I used up all my coins
making this shirt.

13:58.662 --> 14:02.164
Oh, mom, I think something's
wrong with your dryer.

14:02.199 --> 14:04.867
Who is that?

14:04.901 --> 14:08.004
[Vehicle approaching]

14:08.038 --> 14:09.706
[Tires squealing]

14:09.741 --> 14:11.942
[Engine revving]

14:15.680 --> 14:17.481
[Gasps] It's Bugs!

14:17.515 --> 14:19.216
That's not the Bugs I know.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.518
That's not the Bugs I know, either.

14:21.552 --> 14:24.121
But I kinda like it.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.257
Where do you think
you're going, young lady?

14:27.291 --> 14:28.458
Wherever he'll take me!

14:28.493 --> 14:30.894
I forbid you to go out
with that hoodlum.

14:30.929 --> 14:32.529
But daddy, I love him!

14:32.564 --> 14:34.498
Go to your room!

14:34.532 --> 14:36.500
I don't even live here anymore!

14:36.534 --> 14:39.236
Well, then, go to your old room

14:39.270 --> 14:41.505
that your mother turned into
her scrapbooking room!

14:41.540 --> 14:44.275
[Sobbing]

14:44.309 --> 14:46.644
[Door opens and closes]

14:46.678 --> 14:50.948
Get off my property, Thugs Bunny!

14:50.982 --> 14:52.716
Bun bun!

14:52.751 --> 14:55.452
I'll come back for ya.

15:01.025 --> 15:05.162
You know, we were young once.

15:07.231 --> 15:09.433
[Crying]

[Crickets chirping]

15:13.471 --> 15:16.106
[Classical music playing]

15:19.576 --> 15:22.078
That doesn't look like
it's got enough red marks.

15:22.112 --> 15:23.980
Maybe I'll circle this,

15:24.015 --> 15:26.283
maybe three question marks here.

15:26.317 --> 15:30.921
"X" this out, underline
this real aggressively.

15:30.955 --> 15:33.357
What do I do here?

15:33.391 --> 15:35.692
Oh!

15:35.727 --> 15:37.361
Frowny face.

15:37.395 --> 15:41.265
Better luck next time, Melanie.

15:41.299 --> 15:43.701
[Motorcycle approaching]

[Music stops]

16:22.475 --> 16:25.143
How about a little respect?

16:25.178 --> 16:26.545
You're not the boss of me.

16:26.579 --> 16:29.481
Go ahead, run away.

16:29.516 --> 16:31.383
You don't understand me!

16:31.417 --> 16:34.353
No one understands me!

16:40.293 --> 16:41.626
[Engine revving]

16:41.661 --> 16:43.562
You're not gonna find

16:43.596 --> 16:46.164
what you're looking for on the streak.

16:46.199 --> 16:47.766
How do you know?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.936
Because I used to be just like you.

16:51.971 --> 16:56.608
I wasn't always
a respected member of society.

16:56.642 --> 17:00.278
In fact, I used to be
so wild and crazy,

17:00.312 --> 17:01.913
they actually called me "Daffy".

17:01.947 --> 17:04.015
Why should I trust you?

17:04.050 --> 17:06.718
Maybe you shouldn't.
But give me the chance.

17:06.752 --> 17:09.087
Come to class tomorrow,
8:00 A.M.

[Clock ticking]

17:25.003 --> 17:27.372
[Bell ringing]

17:27.406 --> 17:31.309
All right, class.
I guess that's everyone.

17:31.343 --> 17:36.380
Today we're gonna talk
about checks and balances.

17:39.917 --> 17:43.086
Room for one more?

17:43.120 --> 17:46.289
Always.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.598
Ok.

17:54.633 --> 17:58.302
Checks. Money. Balances.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.705
Balancing on a tight rope.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.607
He makes it, gets a check.

18:03.642 --> 18:05.743
These are high buildings,
probably for a million dollars.

18:05.777 --> 18:08.378
[Cheers and applause]

18:10.915 --> 18:12.650
I learned a lot in there today.

18:12.684 --> 18:14.385
Well, you've got a bright future.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.488
And don't ever let anyone
tell you different.

18:16.522 --> 18:18.490
Thanks again...

18:18.524 --> 18:19.992
Professor.

18:20.026 --> 18:21.994
Hey. You promise me
you'll keep up

18:22.028 --> 18:23.228
with your studies.

18:23.262 --> 18:26.031
He doesn't even go to school here!

18:26.065 --> 18:29.768
You promise me
you'll keep making a difference.

18:29.802 --> 18:32.404
He's not a real Professor!

18:32.438 --> 18:33.672
You know, it's funny.

18:33.706 --> 18:36.041
You dedicate
your whole life to academia,

18:36.075 --> 18:37.910
and you never imagine that one day,

18:37.944 --> 18:40.812
a student will walk into your class

18:40.846 --> 18:44.182
and teach you
the greatest lesson of all--

18:44.216 --> 18:46.017
Trust.

18:46.051 --> 18:47.985
Trust.

18:49.187 --> 18:51.255

18:52.925 --> 18:55.826
Give me those.

What are they talking about?

19:06.605 --> 19:09.774
Is that a flaming carrot?

19:14.380 --> 19:17.315
Where do you think you're going?

19:17.350 --> 19:18.616
Bugs is picking me up.

19:18.651 --> 19:20.384
You'll probably never see us again.

19:20.419 --> 19:21.952
We're probably going to join
a motorcycle gang

19:21.987 --> 19:23.754
and have a bunch of motorcycle babies.

19:23.789 --> 19:26.390
So... later!

finally arrived.

19:46.579 --> 19:48.913
What happened to your bike?

19:48.948 --> 19:50.815
Oh, I sold it.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.922
[Tires squealing]

19:59.826 --> 20:01.693
Be right down.

20:01.728 --> 20:03.829
Almost ready.

20:06.232 --> 20:09.368
Thanks, grand mummy.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.641
And thank you, Lola.

20:18.512 --> 20:20.246
Ooh, don't go too fast!

20:20.281 --> 20:22.182
[Tires squealing]
Ooh!

20:27.855 --> 20:30.056
You gave me an "F"?!

20:30.091 --> 20:32.726
You said you'd give me an "A"!

20:32.760 --> 20:34.729
I wanted to.
I really did.

20:34.763 --> 20:38.366
But I just didn't think you had
a firm grasp of the material.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.568
Thanks a lot, Professor.

20:40.602 --> 20:43.103
- Oh, I'm back to Daffy.
- How come?

20:43.138 --> 20:45.572
Professor's too hard to spell.
Daffy's simple.

20:45.606 --> 20:48.942
D-a-f-y. Boom. Easy.

20:49.844 --> 20:51.578
Oh, here you go.

20:51.612 --> 20:53.279
My credit card?

20:53.313 --> 20:55.114
You're gonna notice
two $14.00 charges

20:55.149 --> 20:56.549
on there to the courthouse.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.552
Oh, and one $700 charge
to contemporary male.
