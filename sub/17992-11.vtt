{\an8}Bitch!

00:07.307 --> 00:10.110
{\an8}I brought you your [bleep]
back, Monistate, I'm tripping.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.612
{\an8}I feel like I'm owed
an apology, too.

00:12.679 --> 00:13.680
{\an8}Well, you're never
going to get it.

00:13.747 --> 00:14.914
{\an8}What's it I'm
hearing about Teairra?

00:14.981 --> 00:15.882
{\an8}She came to lunch.

00:15.949 --> 00:16.816
{\an8}You work for me, right?

00:16.883 --> 00:18.651
{\an8}You cannot talk to Teairra.

00:18.718 --> 00:20.186
{\an8}Why are you turning up
so much on me right now?

00:20.253 --> 00:21.755
{\an8}Loyalty is everything.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.056
{\an8}You're going to say I'm not?

00:23.123 --> 00:24.057
{\an8}You're working with Teairra.

00:24.124 --> 00:24.891
{\an8}Who, my boo?

00:24.958 --> 00:26.292
{\an8}That's your boo now?

00:26.359 --> 00:27.494
{\an8}She's probably going to be mad.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.495
{\an8}I don't care.

00:28.561 --> 00:29.863
{\an8}Me and you, we're nothing.

00:29.929 --> 00:30.730
{\an8}We're friends.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.026
{\an8}I cannot do it anymore.

01:00.093 --> 01:03.730
{\an8}The things I did to Teairra
was out of me being spiteful.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.132
{\an8}I believe you really
owe her an apology.

01:06.199 --> 01:08.868
{\an8}Some of the things I did to
you, I apologize for that.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.003
{\an8}That's some [bleep].

{\an8}Do you not want me and
Princess to be together?

nothing private we talk about.

{\an8}Do you think that's cool?

01:22.148 --> 01:23.283
{\an8}It's janky as [bleep].

01:23.349 --> 01:24.284
{\an8}So are you.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.518
{\an8}Okay.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.085

wants me to hook you up with

{\an5}might be broken up.

02:08.161 --> 02:11.364
{\an5}We only got to talk one time on
Skype and I didn't even get to

02:11.431 --> 02:13.299
{\an5}tell him I was pregnant.

02:13.366 --> 02:16.769
Then I had a miscarriage and
I had to text him the news.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.671
Hey, hi, baby.

02:18.738 --> 02:19.806
Hi.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.140
I did text him that I
didn't think he cared.

02:21.207 --> 02:24.911
I guess he got mad and I got
blocked off to an Instagram.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.946
At this point I can't
even cry anymore,

02:27.013 --> 02:28.515
I just need a friend to talk to.

02:28.581 --> 02:29.315
I'm mad at you.

02:29.382 --> 02:30.650
Why are you mad at me?

02:30.717 --> 02:32.952
Because I'm worried about you.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.922
{\an5}Nia told me she was
pregnant and hadn't told Soulja.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.991
{\an5}I'm kind of dying to
know how he took the news.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.225
Are you okay though?

02:39.292 --> 02:40.293
What happened?

02:40.360 --> 02:45.098
I ended up having a miscarriage.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.232
For real.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.167
I really don't know.

02:48.234 --> 02:51.004
One minute I'm fine and
then the next I'm crying.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.573
I don't know if I was really
ready to have a baby with him.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.874
I don't know really.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.009
It was still your baby.

02:56.075 --> 02:57.110
Exactly.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.578
I don't know what I
really would have done.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.046
So, what did Soulja say?

03:00.113 --> 03:03.016
It's just weird, we're in a
really weird place right now.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.486
He even went to
blocking me on Instagram.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.788
Like just mad at me.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.689
For what?

03:09.756 --> 03:11.524
Because I was upset with him.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.727
Dre and I have always had
problems with our communication

03:14.794 --> 03:16.396
and that's why we broke up so
many times within

03:16.462 --> 03:17.964
this eight years.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.801
He doesn't like having serious
conversations and he shuts down.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.203
I need him to just grow up for
ten minutes and have an adult

03:24.270 --> 03:26.839
conversation with me
about what just happened.

03:26.906 --> 03:27.974
Because I'm not over it.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.842
I'm in and out with my emotions.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.044
I get it.

Losing a baby is
not something small.

Our situation is similar,
so I understand where

08:14.126 --> 08:15.761
you're coming from.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.964
Okay, so she's had her
own trouble in the romance

08:18.030 --> 08:21.767
department, let's see if she
can understand my struggle.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.470
I heard she's like a spoiled,
little rich girl running her

08:24.537 --> 08:25.738
mom and dad's strip club.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.674
But after dealing with Amanda
and all her cheating, I can deal

08:28.741 --> 08:30.576
with a pampered princess.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.078
You gotta learn how to just move
forward and let go,

08:33.145 --> 08:34.981
forgive and forget.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.549
I went to Yung Berg's
all white party, and lo

08:37.616 --> 08:39.118
and behold Ray's there.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.921
And he comes up to
me and he apologizes.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.722
I don't know if I want
to forgive him or not.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.124
Threw you off, huh?

08:45.191 --> 08:47.827
The way he's been treating me
has been so horrible that I'm

08:47.894 --> 08:52.965
just like there's no way he
wants to apologize sincerely.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.634
Well, let's toast
to the single life.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.735
Cheers to that.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.336
Two beautiful single
ladies next to me.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.371
Yes.

08:58.437 --> 08:59.372
Hopefully.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.573
A single lady that you
should take out again.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.807
Oh, well.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.942
I don't want to get excited.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.443
That might be you.

09:04.510 --> 09:05.611
[laughter]

09:05.678 --> 09:06.612
This is actually
a great picture.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.314
Is it?

09:08.381 --> 09:09.515
I just want to see
your arm around her.

09:09.582 --> 09:11.417
He hasn't even asked
me out on a date yet.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.853
Are you trying to
ask me out ever?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.121
I'm gonna ask.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.790
I'm just going to tell you when
I'm coming to pick you up then.

09:17.857 --> 09:18.958
Where are we going to go?

09:19.025 --> 09:20.026
Where do you want to go?

09:20.092 --> 09:21.494
You have to surprise me.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.796
I love it.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.032
This is a match made in heaven.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.467
{\an8}My relationship
consists of me and Princess.

09:28.534 --> 09:29.669
{\an8}The only person who's really
trying to [bleep] it

09:29.735 --> 09:30.937
{\an8}up is Morgan.

09:31.003 --> 09:34.073
{\an8}All the women in your
life, you can't trust nobody.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.141
{\an8}To new beginnings?

09:35.207 --> 09:38.210
{\an8}Yeah.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.413
{\an8}We both took a
loss, not just you.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.814
{\an8}[crying]

09:41.881 --> 09:45.651
{\an8}You got all this beef over this
[bleep] who's not even your man.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.186
{\an8}You have called me out my
name and you have

09:47.253 --> 09:48.421
{\an8}talked disrespectfully.

09:48.487 --> 09:50.556
{\an8}Yes, I have and you've also
told me to [bleep] you, bitch.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.891
{\an8}And you've done that online.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.726
{\an8}Morgan told me some
foul [bleep] that you did.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.294
{\an8}I consider Morgan as family.

09:55.361 --> 10:00.232
{\an8}I don't want Morgan
having your [bleep] number.

I haven't really spoken to Drew
since our last screaming

10:20.119 --> 10:21.120
{\an5}match over Amanda.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.722
{\an5}And I heard they're broken up.

10:22.788 --> 10:23.856
I don't give a [bleep].

10:23.923 --> 10:25.458
I have my own
[bleep] to worry about.

10:25.524 --> 10:28.260
I spent the last year of my
life sacrificing everything,

10:28.327 --> 10:31.230
including time with my son while
I put all my energy and money

10:31.297 --> 10:32.631
into my sex toy line.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.601
But I guess you can say
before that I was a singer.

10:35.668 --> 10:38.537
I'm still a singer, but it
stopped paying the bills,

10:38.604 --> 10:41.040
so I had to put it on the
shelf to make money.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.242
But when I'm feeling defeated
the only thing that

10:43.309 --> 10:45.144
lifts my spirits is singing.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.413
So, my cousin is bare none,
hands down one of

10:47.480 --> 10:49.348
the best vocalists ever.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.450
And aside from working on the
voice, he's known for working

10:51.517 --> 10:54.086
with some of the most A-list
celebrities and singers

10:54.153 --> 10:56.122
that we know today.

10:56.188 --> 11:00.259
But thank God he works
with family for the free 99.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.827
You have a lot on your mind.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.630
I can hear everything when
people sing and you sound good,

11:04.697 --> 11:06.632
{\an5}but you sound all over
the place at the same time.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.935
It's just that at this moment
everything is topsy turvy.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.439
I thought things were going
to go one way, they went left.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.041
What happened with your company.

11:15.107 --> 11:18.144
Designer and investor
didn't see eye to eye.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.812
So, I made the decision to
let go of the investors,

11:19.879 --> 11:21.280
so I'm back to square one.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.315
Tragedy struck a ho.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.886
I had this amazing
record deal, things went bad.

11:26.952 --> 11:30.122
I had to move back home with my
parents, I had to give up most

11:30.189 --> 11:34.260
of my physical custody with my
son, allow his dad to take him

11:34.326 --> 11:36.862
while I got back on my feet.

11:36.929 --> 11:37.930
What's going on with you?

11:37.997 --> 11:41.000
What's up with you Cam
and your living situation?

11:41.067 --> 11:45.538
We decided that he would go and
live with Drew during the week

11:45.604 --> 11:47.540
and I would take weekends while
I get back on my feet,

11:47.606 --> 11:49.375
find a new place.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.645
And Drew, what he's saying is
because I don't get along with

11:52.711 --> 11:55.314
my roommate, Cameron
shouldn't be there.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.283
After I moved out of my parent's
house, my living situation

11:57.349 --> 11:59.085
was definitely not ideal.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.354
I decided to roommate with a
guy and it is strictly platonic.

12:02.421 --> 12:07.460
Unfortunately he's a [bleep] and
I've been saving up my money to

12:07.526 --> 12:10.296
get my own place and I bought
myself a car so that I could get

12:10.362 --> 12:14.166
around and spend more time
with my muffin, baby steps.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.236
Drew likes to flex his power
in terms of using Cameron

12:17.303 --> 12:18.771
as a pawn.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.540
When I'm at my weakest point is
when he seems to set the

12:21.607 --> 12:23.943
bar sky freaking high.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.779
We have to let people be
what they are and focus

12:26.846 --> 12:28.781
on our mission.

12:28.848 --> 12:32.451
You gotta focus on your
first love, this is music.

12:32.518 --> 12:36.489
I have a goal in mind, and right
now my first step is getting out

12:36.555 --> 12:37.957
of the situation
with my roommate.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.024
Okay.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.192
Okay, and getting a place.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.627
You should be singing about
not having your own place.

12:41.694 --> 12:42.695
♪ I ain't got my own place ♪

12:42.761 --> 12:44.130
[laughter]

12:44.196 --> 12:46.632
You should be singing about
everything that's going on.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.502
You can't put singing aside
and say, "Hold on, singing,

12:49.568 --> 12:50.603
I'm going to do this."

12:50.669 --> 12:53.105
Singing comes along
with whatever happens.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.508
Bring your crazy, bring your
life, bring every piece of it

12:55.574 --> 12:57.243
into your music.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.678
I do want to sing, but there are
a few things that I have to get

12:59.745 --> 13:01.881
in order first before I can
completely submerge

13:01.947 --> 13:03.482
myself back in the studio.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.252
Fret not, I do
have a master plan.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.854
So, in five years this is
what I want to see for myself.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.856
Dildo sales, I'm not
trying to be funny.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.826
I want to see album sales.

13:13.893 --> 13:20.132
I want to see touring and mostly
importantly co-parenting and

13:20.199 --> 13:23.068
rebuilding the foundation
between Drew and I

13:23.135 --> 13:25.404
so we can be amicable.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.274
I want you to believe in
yourself as much as I believe

13:28.340 --> 13:29.742
in you, because I really do.

13:29.808 --> 13:30.743
I believe.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.545
♪ I believe in you. ♪

13:32.611 --> 13:37.149

13:37.216 --> 13:39.852
You know what, messy ass Morgan
is out of my life for good.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.654
I know she been gossiping,
telling Princess

13:41.720 --> 13:43.155
all my business.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.458
{\an5}And I know she's been telling
Teairra about my [bleep] too.

13:46.525 --> 13:50.763
But now Morgan's got me
questioning Princess's loyalty.

13:50.829 --> 13:53.365
And that bothers me because
she's supposed to be my girl.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.302
But there's been one person
that's been loyal to me from

13:56.368 --> 13:58.504
day one, and will always be.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.705
Good to see you, B.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.107
Brandy's been out of town
working, so we really haven't

14:02.174 --> 14:04.076
got a chance to talk about
everything that's been

14:04.143 --> 14:06.045
happening in my life.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.846
{\an8}How are you doing,
for real, for real?

14:07.913 --> 14:09.381
{\an8}It's been rough.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.917
It's so many people trying to
make people feel a certain

14:11.984 --> 14:13.953
way inside and they can't.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.454
Like everything
bad start happening.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.256
Can I just be
completely honest with you?

14:17.323 --> 14:19.358
It's you.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.559
It's your choices.

14:20.626 --> 14:24.997
You put yourself in positions
where the worst comes out.

14:25.064 --> 14:26.365
I talked to mom.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.701
What'd she say?

14:28.767 --> 14:33.405
She was just like
concerned about my environment.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.808
She was talking about
how she liked Teairra.

14:35.874 --> 14:40.279
It was just weird because it
was like I ain't even with her.

14:40.346 --> 14:44.116
Moms is just worried
about who I got around.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.551
I don't like your
environment either,

14:45.618 --> 14:46.885
I don't think it's healthy.

14:46.952 --> 14:49.188
See, my mom and Brandy can talk
about my environment

14:49.255 --> 14:50.756
all the want.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.591
I know they talking about
Princess and I know they

14:52.658 --> 14:54.526
some Teairra lovers.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.495
And guess what, I'm man
enough to admit that

14:56.562 --> 14:58.063
I love Teairra too.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.934
But we got to a place where
we just couldn't get it right.

15:02.001 --> 15:05.337
And before things got
too heated, it had to end.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.806
I'm putting all this on you
because I feel like the only

15:07.873 --> 15:10.743
way we can change is
taking full responsibility.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.811
I'm starting to
make my adjustments.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.014
I'm going back a little bit and
make sure I deal with certain

15:15.080 --> 15:17.850
things, like the way I did with
Teairra, all the crazy [bleep]

15:17.916 --> 15:18.817
I did to her.

15:18.884 --> 15:19.585
You apologized.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.387
What happened?

15:21.453 --> 15:22.788
I seen her at the
Yung Berg party.

15:22.855 --> 15:27.126
She just didn't take it well and
she started talking about how

15:27.192 --> 15:31.263
I'm not happy and how people
telling me about me and Princess

15:31.330 --> 15:32.965
and what me and
her got going on.

15:33.032 --> 15:34.667
And I'm like, what
is you talking about?

15:34.733 --> 15:35.768
You love Princess?

15:35.834 --> 15:37.403
Of course I love Princess.

15:37.469 --> 15:41.874
I know you love her, but do you
love her like on this is someone

15:41.940 --> 15:44.677
you want to spend
your life with?

15:44.743 --> 15:47.446
Yeah, we straight like this.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.615
And B, when you're in a
relationship, you gotta

15:49.682 --> 15:51.917
work out the kinks.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.285
If you can't go through the
ups and downs,

15:53.352 --> 15:55.220
then you can't be together.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.221
The only person that's really
trying to [bleep] it

15:56.288 --> 15:57.423
up is Morgan.

15:57.489 --> 16:00.259
I don't want Morgan
talking to Princess.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.527
Why is Morgan like in
everybody's business,

16:01.593 --> 16:02.995
that's what I don't
get, but why?

16:03.062 --> 16:04.296
But Morgan is messy as [bleep].

16:04.363 --> 16:05.931
But she's your assistant.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.700
This ain't my assistant.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.001
Morgan's been fired.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.269
Since when?

16:10.336 --> 16:12.271
Morgan's been
fired for weeks now.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.573
Let me just tell you right now.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.577
All the women in your life from
Princess to Morgan,

16:18.644 --> 16:21.613
all of them are talking
to all of them.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.148
You can't trust nobody.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.551
Princess is
listening to somebody.

16:25.617 --> 16:28.153
What Princess is allowing is
going to break you guys apart

16:28.220 --> 16:30.255
and it's going to be
a public shenanigan.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.725
That's my word for
your experience.

16:32.791 --> 16:33.959
You know what, it's
not going to be that.

16:34.026 --> 16:34.927
You know why?

16:34.993 --> 16:36.695
Because as long as I can
make my adjustments,

16:36.762 --> 16:38.197
it's going to be cool.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.233
With these relationships that's
going on, everybody trying to

16:41.300 --> 16:44.169

painful as it is for you,

25:41.806 --> 25:43.041
just as hard as it is for you.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.109
It's hard for me.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.011
I really don't want
to talk about this.

25:46.077 --> 25:52.550
We both took a loss,
not just you, me too.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.953
Just get your [bleep] together.

25:55.020 --> 26:08.166
♪♪

26:08.233 --> 26:08.867
Hi.

26:08.934 --> 26:09.968
Hi.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.770
I brought us some iced
coffee as a peace offering?

26:11.836 --> 26:12.737
Thank you.

26:12.804 --> 26:13.872
What's in them, poison?

26:13.939 --> 26:14.773
No.

26:14.839 --> 26:15.974
I'm just kidding.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.209
{\an5}So, I would love to squash
the beef with me and TT.

26:18.276 --> 26:21.780
{\an5}I reached out and surprisingly
she agreed to link up.

26:21.846 --> 26:22.814
The other night was crazy.

26:22.881 --> 26:26.284
Yeah, with all the
Berg stuff going on.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.720
{\an8}He want to take records
back, do all the fraud stuff.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.422
That my friends warned me about.

26:30.488 --> 26:33.825
That's why at his party I don't
even know why I'm mad at these

26:33.892 --> 26:35.627
bitches because you're the
worst [bleep] of them all.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.762
You know he ain't
never been your man, ever.

26:37.829 --> 26:40.432
He was definitely filling my
head with the dreams and

26:40.498 --> 26:41.833
the sun and moon and the stars.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.736
And everybody want to act like
I'm so delusional about Berg.

26:44.803 --> 26:47.472
Berg plays a part
in my delusion.

26:47.539 --> 26:48.840
Yeah.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.776
You know, when I saw you at
Masika's little strip club

26:51.843 --> 26:55.714
billboard situation, you know, I
already went there to holler

26:55.780 --> 26:59.050
at her about this
Instagram and stuff with Berg.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.618
So, I was already turned up.

27:00.685 --> 27:03.755
Things went from 0 to 100
real quick like they always do.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.358
You know, we gotta figure this
thing out because at the end of

27:06.424 --> 27:12.497
the day we're both hurt, we've
both done [bleep] up things.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.299
Every time we got around each
other, I just felt like we was

27:14.366 --> 27:17.969
going to kill each other,
every single time we met.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.605
And you know what, we probably
just need some space

27:20.672 --> 27:21.806
from each other.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.209
Up until me moving out,
things was just crazy.

27:24.275 --> 27:28.313
And that's why I say I will, you
know, apologize for how I did

27:28.380 --> 27:31.850
things and how, you know,
I left the situation without

27:31.916 --> 27:33.318
giving notice.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.720
I would have been happy for
you to move out on your own.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.789
But you just left.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.291
And if you were having
issues with me,

27:40.358 --> 27:42.260
you should have addressed
me and just told me,

27:42.327 --> 27:44.829
"TT, this is not
healthy for me."

27:44.896 --> 27:48.333
I just felt like on top of you
moving out, everybody is coming

27:48.400 --> 27:51.970
to me telling me that you're
saying certain things about me.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.039
At the time my
feelings were hurt.

27:54.105 --> 27:57.542
I was like damn, she be knacking
in the studio with you,

27:57.609 --> 27:59.344
his boo and stuff.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.779
If he said that, he
said that to piss you of.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.147
And you got pissed off.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.349
And you got pissed off,
it worked.

28:04.416 --> 28:08.920
You got all this beef over this
[bleep] who's not even your man

28:08.987 --> 28:10.155
and he don't give a [bleep].

28:10.221 --> 28:11.689
And I told you from
the beginning that.

28:11.756 --> 28:14.025
Yeah, I could have listened to
my bitches, but you know me,

28:14.092 --> 28:15.427
I wear my heart on my sleeve.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.830
And I just wanted my friend
just to have my back

28:18.897 --> 28:20.231
a little bit more.

28:20.298 --> 28:26.905
I apologize if, you know what
I'm saying, if I hurt you from

28:26.971 --> 28:29.941
talking, you know what I'm
saying, to Masika, or venting.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.976
Yeah, you did.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.313
But I still needed you to be a
friend to me, you know

28:35.380 --> 28:36.314
what I'm saying.

28:36.381 --> 28:41.119
I also want you to know
that you hurt me too.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.720
Like, I'm not made of steel.

28:42.787 --> 28:45.123
I don't know if you want
to repair this friendship.

28:45.190 --> 28:52.330
But it's like I want you to not
even do the record with Berg.

28:52.397 --> 28:56.101
I know it's like
almost an ultimatum to say.

28:56.167 --> 28:59.537
And that's absolutely absurd to
me, you know what I'm saying.

28:59.604 --> 29:02.841
And if you were my friend
and I have a hot record,

29:02.907 --> 29:04.209
you should support that.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.077
But that record was
like out of spite.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.178
How was it out of spite?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.513
That record is speaking.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.048
It wasn't out of spite for
you, it was out of spite for me.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.249
I don't care.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.685
That record is speaking to
something inside of me, okay.

29:13.751 --> 29:17.622
And if that's what you want,
that's not going to happen.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.023
I would do it for you.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.792
That's the difference
between me and you, Hazel.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.360
I wouldn't ask you to do.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.330
It's done, it's signed, it's
sealed and it's delivered,

29:25.396 --> 29:26.231
Hazel.

29:26.297 --> 29:27.499
I'm not going to take that back.

29:27.565 --> 29:31.736
I hate that you would base
us moving on off of that.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.204
That's [bleep] up to me.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.639
You didn't think about me when
you moved out and left

29:34.706 --> 29:36.174
me high and dry.

29:36.241 --> 29:39.210
And if those are your conditions
for us to move forward,

29:39.277 --> 29:41.012
honey, bye.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.573
So, Drew, AKA my baby daddy, who
takes every opportunity to avoid

30:08.640 --> 30:11.676
{\an5}me, has text me and said
we need to meet up ASAP.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.279
And I'm pretty sure I
know what it is about.

30:14.345 --> 30:17.949
So, a few blogs reached out to
me about my relationship to Drew

30:18.016 --> 30:20.818
and I said somethings that
looking back in hindsight I

30:20.885 --> 30:22.120
probably shouldn't have said.

30:22.187 --> 30:23.621
But I was in my feelings.

30:23.688 --> 30:25.890
And in the moment I just want
the world to know that I'm not

30:25.957 --> 30:30.562
the despicable mother that
Drew paints me out to be.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.630
What's going on, baby daddy?

30:32.697 --> 30:35.633
So, Moniece has been talking
to the blogs and doing these

30:35.700 --> 30:38.970
{\an5}interviews saying that, you
know, I put hands on her,

30:39.037 --> 30:40.672
that I try to keep her
away from my son.

30:40.738 --> 30:44.809
Just ridiculous, outlandish
[bleep] that's not true.

30:44.876 --> 30:48.213
I'm here today because she needs
to shut that down immediately.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.715
I'm going to try to keep my calm
because I know how Moniece

30:50.782 --> 30:53.384
can go from 0 to 100.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.587
And in order to get her to do
what I need her to do,

30:55.653 --> 30:58.957
I'm going to have to approach
her a little bit differently.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.558
I brought you a piece offering.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.860
And I left your little
paper on your straw.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.028
You don't have no
poison in it do you?

31:04.095 --> 31:05.029
No.

31:05.096 --> 31:06.831
So, for whatever reason,
including Drew,

31:06.898 --> 31:09.200
seems to think I'm the only
reason for our breakup.

31:09.267 --> 31:12.670
But Drew played a significant
role in the messiness.

31:12.737 --> 31:15.940
And I feel like the root of our
problem is we never got a chance

31:16.007 --> 31:18.176
to talk about how we ended.

31:18.243 --> 31:19.611
And I feel like if we can
get on the same page,

31:19.677 --> 31:21.613
we can both be better
parents for Cam.

31:21.679 --> 31:26.217
I've been like trying to make a
little life change of my own.

31:26.284 --> 31:31.256
I stay in therapy, as you know,
so it can help me deal with you,

31:31.322 --> 31:33.458
so that we can get along better.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.561
We were already on the rocks
when I found out I was pregnant.

31:36.628 --> 31:40.565
And me deciding to keep Cameron
wasn't like to keep you,

31:40.632 --> 31:44.102
it was just something I
had always wanted.

31:44.168 --> 31:46.037
I think things just fell apart,
but we've never actually

31:46.104 --> 31:48.006
had a discussion where
it was like, okay, Drew,

31:48.072 --> 31:49.474
this is what hurt me.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.976
Okay, Moniece, I'm sorry,
this is what you did to hurt me.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.912
At the end of the day we are a
family, and we are a

31:54.979 --> 31:56.514
family for Cameron.

31:56.581 --> 32:00.218
Here goes Moniece again trying
to take a trip down memory lane.

32:00.285 --> 32:01.653
I'm not your therapist.

32:01.719 --> 32:04.055
All I want to do is make a
safe environment for our son

32:04.122 --> 32:06.257
and dampen this online [bleep].

32:06.324 --> 32:07.725
We are a family.

32:07.792 --> 32:09.727
Us three are always
going to be connected.

32:09.794 --> 32:12.263
So, to go online and try to
portray me a certain

32:12.330 --> 32:13.665
way is wrong.

32:13.731 --> 32:15.500
You put these certain lies
out that we know are lies.

32:15.566 --> 32:18.102
You know I've never abused you.

32:18.169 --> 32:22.507
You know I've never tried to
keep Cameron away from you.

32:22.573 --> 32:25.176
I feel like you try to portray
yourself as the victim and

32:25.243 --> 32:26.577
then put it all on me.

32:26.644 --> 32:29.514
It's one thing for you to defend
yourself when you feel provoked,

32:29.580 --> 32:32.216
but when I move to defend
myself when I'm provoked,

32:32.283 --> 32:33.985
I'm the problem child.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.386
I'm not always
the problem child.

32:35.453 --> 32:36.988
And when I start speaking
on the truth,

32:37.055 --> 32:39.023
bum boy here can't handle it.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.024
Let's keep it real.

32:40.091 --> 32:41.359
You're making [bleep] bad.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.161
You're making me look bad,
you're making yourself look bad.

32:43.227 --> 32:44.228
No, I'm defending myself.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.296
And you're making
things worse for Cam.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.364
I'm defending myself.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.700
Well, that's not what
everybody else was saying.

32:48.766 --> 32:49.967
I don't give a [bleep] about
what everybody says,

32:50.034 --> 32:51.002
I give a [bleep] about
what you say.

32:51.069 --> 32:52.337
I say you were
communicating with me.

32:52.403 --> 32:54.605
Communicating with you
has been a dead end.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.974
Because look at
how you communicate.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.276
You have called me out on
my name and you have

32:58.343 --> 32:59.043
talked disrespectfully.

32:59.110 --> 32:59.844
Yes, I did.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.012
And you do that online.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.213
You have, and you've also
told me [bleep] you, bitch.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.381
You stupid bitch.

33:03.448 --> 33:04.015
I have way more respect for
you than you have for me.

33:04.082 --> 33:04.849
That's a lie.

33:04.916 --> 33:05.683
And it's sad to say.

33:05.750 --> 33:06.617
I should have way less respect.

33:06.684 --> 33:07.685
That's sad.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.088
I'm the [bleep] that's
actually doing everything.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.789
Do you want a cookie?

33:11.856 --> 33:13.391
If you did some --
yeah, I want a cookie.

33:13.458 --> 33:14.392
Where's it at?

33:14.459 --> 33:15.626
I don't know.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.563
Exactly, you don't have the
cookie, you don't have the time,

33:18.629 --> 33:19.297
you don't have a job,
you don't have the house,

33:19.364 --> 33:21.232
you don't have nothing.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.434
I'm not asking for the
mom of the year award.

33:23.501 --> 33:26.371
I'm asking for
some [bleep] respect.

33:26.437 --> 33:29.107
He's going to make me look like
I'm a deadbeat and a bum when

33:29.173 --> 33:31.209
in all reality this
arrangement of Cameron

33:31.275 --> 33:33.878
living with him has only
been since June.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.413
So, why the [bleep] do you
deserve a cookie for doing

33:35.480 --> 33:38.783
what you're supposed to
do when I fall short?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.752
You're constantly
pointing out what's not there.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.353
You're constantly
pointing out what's wrong.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.554
Because that's
the stuff he needs.

33:43.621 --> 33:45.223
You're not ever
offering a solution.

33:45.289 --> 33:47.425
Moniece is a pathological liar.

33:47.492 --> 33:49.227
Let's take it all the way
back since we want to

33:49.293 --> 33:51.129
get to the facts.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.797
Since he was seven
or eight-months-old,

33:52.864 --> 33:55.767
a situation happened where
the courts granted me

33:55.833 --> 33:58.169
sole custody of our child.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.738
Of course, it required Moniece
to meet certain criteria.

34:00.805 --> 34:04.142
She wasn't even granted
joint custody until 2012.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.577
Our son was
two-years-old by that time.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.880
Three months into
that she gave up.

34:08.946 --> 34:10.882
He's been living
with me ever since.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.418
I'm going to always
be the mother if I have

34:13.484 --> 34:15.353
to be the mother.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.054
I don't care because that's what
a real young, black father

34:18.121 --> 34:19.724
would do for his son.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.893
Every time you get ten seconds
with Cameron, all you do is say,

34:21.958 --> 34:24.128
"Take a selfie with me, Cam."

34:24.195 --> 34:25.196
