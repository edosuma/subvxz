00:00.166 --> 00:02.083
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives:

00:02.166 --> 00:05.500
The police showed me your rap sheet.
You killed a man.

00:05.583 --> 00:08.166
- Want to hear what happened?
- It doesn't matter.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.166
I will never believe
anything you say ever again.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.500
<i>Unexpected visitors...</i>

00:13.583 --> 00:15.709
- She's cheating on you?
- I think so.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.834
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you, Mama.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.417
<i>...lead to unexpected consequences.</i>

00:20.500 --> 00:23.291
Andrew, you almost killed
another human being.

00:23.375 --> 00:25.000
She's lived her life.

00:25.083 --> 00:28.625
I have my whole life ahead of me
and now it might be screwed up.

00:34.875 --> 00:38.583
<i>In the coma ward</i>
<i>at Sacred Heart Hospital,</i>

00:38.667 --> 00:42.834
<i>the dreams begin just after midnight.</i>

00:42.917 --> 00:46.125
<i>The pitch black of night</i>
<i>gives way to vivid images</i>

00:46.208 --> 00:48.792
<i>that comfort the dreamer</i>
<i>until the morning.</i>

00:50.625 --> 00:52.291
<i>Gus, the custodian,</i>

00:52.375 --> 00:55.750
<i>dreams of some day winning the lottery</i>

00:55.834 --> 00:59.000
<i>and quitting his thankless job.</i>

01:01.750 --> 01:03.834
<i>Howard, the security guard,</i>

01:03.917 --> 01:09.583
<i>envisions a luxurious retirement</i>
<i>in the tropics.</i>

01:09.667 --> 01:12.583
<i>Ruth Ann, the night nurse,</i>

01:12.667 --> 01:15.875
<i>fantasizes about leaving her husband.</i>

01:19.333 --> 01:26.166
<i>But the most vivid dreams of all</i>
<i>belong to the patient in Room 312.</i>

01:26.250 --> 01:32.083
<i>Yes, Juanita Solis had been</i>
<i>dreaming steadily for five months.</i>

01:32.166 --> 01:37.667
<i>Sometimes, of the shocking secret</i>
<i>she had uncovered.</i>

01:39.875 --> 01:45.125
<i>Other times, she dreamt of the accident</i>
<i>that had put her in the hospital.</i>

01:47.250 --> 01:49.458
<i>But her most common dream</i>

01:50.542 --> 01:55.709
<i>was the one in which</i>
<i>she finally told her son the truth.</i>

01:57.875 --> 01:59.959
<i>And then one night,</i>

02:00.041 --> 02:04.250
<i>Juanita Solis decided it was time</i>

02:04.333 --> 02:06.083
<i>to wake up.</i>

02:11.917 --> 02:13.458
Hello?

02:14.834 --> 02:17.083
Is anybody here?

02:25.792 --> 02:27.792
I have to call my son.

03:03.959 --> 03:08.667
<i>Even though she knew she was</i>
<i>about to die, Juanita didn't care.</i>

03:08.750 --> 03:11.875
<i>The truth was finally going to come out.</i>

03:11.959 --> 03:15.041
Tell my son his wife is cheating on him.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.625
Oh, my God.

03:16.709 --> 03:21.959
<i>Sadly for Juanita, this was</i>
<i>one dream that would never come true.</i>

04:09.375 --> 04:12.750
<i>We all honor heroes</i>
<i>for different reasons.</i>

04:12.834 --> 04:15.375
<i>Sometimes for their bravery,</i>

04:15.458 --> 04:18.458
<i>sometimes for their daring,</i>

04:18.542 --> 04:22.166
<i>sometimes for their goodness.</i>

04:22.250 --> 04:28.166
<i>But mostly we honor heroes</i>
<i>because, at one point or another,</i>

04:28.250 --> 04:31.750
<i>we all dream of being rescued.</i>

04:37.375 --> 04:40.917
Susan, I know you're in there.
We have to talk.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.625
This is crazy.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.083
I know.

04:50.917 --> 04:54.041
Everything the cop said is true.
I did kill somebody.

04:54.125 --> 04:57.959
But there's one thing they didn't
tell you. I killed for you, Susan.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.875
Susan, if I can't have you,
no one else can.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.500
Shut up.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.583
Susan, are you home?

05:25.291 --> 05:28.583
Susan? Your car's here.
I know you're in there.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.667
I was hoping we could talk for a minute.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.083
Susan, maybe you should have waited
till I left to do that.

05:47.083 --> 05:50.667
I know you don't want to see me
right now but I owe you an explanation,

05:50.750 --> 05:54.709
and it's all in there, everything
you ever wanted to know about my past,

05:54.792 --> 05:56.500
my reasons for doing what I did.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.792
It's all there.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.375
Hey.

06:20.458 --> 06:23.166
Guys, come on. What are you doing?

06:25.208 --> 06:28.291
You know, just bonding,
discussing current events...

06:28.917 --> 06:32.709
Seriously, if you'd just parked across
the street I could have let you go.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.417
Why don't you just pretend like we did?

06:36.333 --> 06:38.792
Get out of the car.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.500
- Get this.
- Hey.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.750
Stop the car.

06:47.917 --> 06:51.625
I can't believe it. Two months
from graduation and he's expelled.

06:51.709 --> 06:55.709
We are just lucky that security guard
did not press charges.

06:55.792 --> 07:00.333
- So what are we going to do?
- I'm glad that you asked.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.709
- What are these?
- Brochures for youth detention centers.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.166
How long have you had these?

07:13.250 --> 07:17.000
They've been in the drawer a few months.
I had a feeling we might need them.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.709
Bree, I don't know.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.792
We have to admit that we need help.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.834
If we can't get through to Andrew,
we need someone who can.

07:24.917 --> 07:27.542
You want to send our son
away to some prison camp?

07:27.625 --> 07:31.375
Don't be so dramatic.
Some of these places actually look fun.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.917
Look. Camp Hennessey.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.792
"Teaches kids respect for authority
and boundaries

07:36.917 --> 07:39.291
in a summer camp atmosphere."

07:39.375 --> 07:42.667
The perimeter is surrounded by
an electrified fence.

07:42.750 --> 07:46.917
You have to admit that's an efficient
way to teach respect for boundaries.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.125
OK, how about this one?
It's perfect for Andrew.

07:50.208 --> 07:54.709
It's a ranch in Montana. It has lots
of fresh air and plenty of open spaces.

07:54.792 --> 07:58.583
- And daily classes on anger management.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

07:58.667 --> 08:02.709
All right, how about this one? It's
in the desert and it's very reasonable.

08:02.792 --> 08:07.458
The barracks are a little bit bleak
but that recidivism rate is to die for.

08:07.542 --> 08:11.083
Bree, I'm not doing it.
I'm not sending my son away.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.542
It's easy for you, isn't it?

08:13.625 --> 08:16.959
You're not the one he's rude to,
the one he challenges every day.

08:18.625 --> 08:22.667
- You're not the one he hates.
- I'll talk to him. All right?

08:22.750 --> 08:26.583
I'll sit him down for a little
old-fashioned heart-to-heart.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.166
You talk to him all you want.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.500
I'm gonna check out
the place with the electrified fence.

08:35.125 --> 08:38.542
Listen, my children, and you shall hear

08:38.625 --> 08:40.792
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere

08:40.875 --> 08:44.917
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch

08:45.000 --> 08:47.041
Of the North Church tower

08:47.125 --> 08:49.542
One if by land, two if by sea

08:49.625 --> 08:52.458
And I on the opposite shore will be

08:57.750 --> 09:02.291
Hi, I wanted to introduce myself
to your mom. I'm Lynette Scavo.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.625
Hi, Lynette. I'm Alisa Stevens.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.417
I'm sorry. I thought...

09:06.500 --> 09:08.834
I read lips.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.417
A lot of the time,
signing is just easier.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.583
I don't like to misunderstand,
or to be misunderstood.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.917
- And I'm Lily.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.291
Hi, Mom.

09:20.375 --> 09:23.583
- That's my son, Matt.
- My twins talk about Matt all the time.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.166
- We should set up a play date.
- Sounds great.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.000
- Let's have dinner too.
- I'd love to.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.959
- The British are coming.
- Giddy-up.

09:33.333 --> 09:36.291
Even better, let's just keep it adults.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.792
Babe, they blinked.

09:38.875 --> 09:42.125
- We got 'em by the short hairs.
- Who blinked?

09:42.208 --> 09:44.583
The DA. I just spoke with the lawyers.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.458
- They offered a plea bargain.
- And that's good?

09:47.542 --> 09:51.667
It means they know they got a weak case.
They don't think they can win.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.375
- It's over.
- Oh, my God.

09:54.458 --> 09:58.542
- That means we can keep the house.
- No, we still have to sell the house.

09:58.625 --> 10:01.959
- I gotta pay the lawyers.
- You said they offered a plea bargain.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.125
Yeah, but we're not gonna take that.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.417
Put me down.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.375
Honey, it would mean
me going to jail for eight months.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.709
I think that's pretty reasonable,
as you're guilty as sin.

10:13.792 --> 10:15.625
You were fine with selling.

10:15.709 --> 10:19.500
Before I knew we could trade
a couple of months in prison to keep it.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.000
What?

10:22.083 --> 10:24.458
No, this is her daughter-in-law.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.750
Is it the hospital? Is it Mama?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.709
Thank you. Yes.

10:38.875 --> 10:39.875
Gabby?

10:39.959 --> 10:42.709
I'm sorry, Carlos.

10:56.709 --> 11:01.000
<i>Some believe people</i>
<i>are judged by the way they live life,</i>

11:01.083 --> 11:04.000
<i>and others by the way they leave it.</i>

11:04.083 --> 11:07.875
I like the Lexington mahogany
with gold leaf.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.458
It has a pink velvet interior
and drapes,

11:10.542 --> 11:14.208
plus it's hand-engraved so
in case of a flood or earthquake,

11:14.291 --> 11:16.417
they'll at least know which one is hers.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.917
Don't you think
that's a little over the top?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.500
Only the best for Mama.

11:20.583 --> 11:24.834
These funeral homes make a fortune
trying to convince people to overspend.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.750
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was sensible.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.834
She wouldn't be comfortable
with bells and whistles.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.959
Maybe this one. Wood veneer.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.375
- What?
- You never liked Mama.

11:38.458 --> 11:42.083
It's awfully hard to like someone
who actively hates your guts.

11:42.166 --> 11:45.000
She thought you married beneath you
and let me know it.

11:45.083 --> 11:48.083
- She loved you.
- She treated me like trash.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.417
God rest her soul.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.333
I'm putting my mother in the grave.
Now is not the time to pinch pennies.

11:53.417 --> 11:56.542
Carlos, we're not exactly
flush with cash right now.

11:56.625 --> 12:00.542
Let her be true to her roots.
She was born humble.

12:00.625 --> 12:04.458
- And barefoot.
- She was a queen.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.959
What did Mike say
when he gave you the letter?

12:11.041 --> 12:13.625
- That it explains everything.
- Does it?

12:13.709 --> 12:15.458
- I haven't read it.
- Why not?

12:15.542 --> 12:19.375
- I just can't.
- I'd have ripped it open with my teeth.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.709
Aren't you dying to know what he wrote?

12:21.792 --> 12:24.875
Yes. But what if it's just
a bunch of far-fetched stories?

12:24.959 --> 12:27.792
- You should assume that it is.
- Why?

12:27.875 --> 12:30.500
Think how good men are
at lying on the spot.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.166
God forbid you should
give them time and a pen.

12:36.291 --> 12:40.834
Edie, could you stop by the site?
I've blueprints of the master bath.

12:40.917 --> 12:43.250
I'll see you in a few, Bill.

12:47.959 --> 12:51.250
My new contractor.
We're sort of dating.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.667
Didn't you once say you never mix
business with pleasure?

12:54.750 --> 12:58.333
No, I said never mix pleasure
with commitment.

12:58.417 --> 12:59.875
Right.

12:59.959 --> 13:04.125
- What are you gonna do with the letter?
- Would you open it up already?

13:06.917 --> 13:08.792
No, I won't.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.583
I don't trust Mike any more
and without trust...

13:12.667 --> 13:15.917
No. I'm just gonna go in
and rip it up and throw it in the trash.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.083
- Why don't we rip it up now?
- No.

13:18.166 --> 13:21.500
That's OK. I don't wanna,
you know, litter.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
She is so opening that letter.

13:31.333 --> 13:35.083
<i>While Carlos was making</i>
<i>arrangements to bury his mother,</i>

13:35.166 --> 13:39.583
<i>Gabrielle was making sure</i>
<i>she'd be taking her secret to the grave.</i>

13:39.667 --> 13:42.041
Hi, I'm Gabrielle Solis.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.000
You're Nurse Hisel?

13:44.083 --> 13:47.917
Yes. Hi.
When you said you were coming,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.166
I collected all the personal things
your husband brought in

13:51.250 --> 13:53.625
during Juanita's stay with us.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.834
I assume that's why you're stopping by?

13:56.917 --> 14:00.834
That's so thoughtful of you
but, actually, no.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.542
No?

14:03.625 --> 14:06.834
No, you see my husband and I
still don't have a clear account

14:06.917 --> 14:09.417
as to how Juanita passed.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.041
How?

14:11.125 --> 14:15.417
Yes, did she die quietly,
in her sleep...?

14:15.500 --> 14:18.625
Yeah, that's usually how it happens.

14:19.792 --> 14:22.542
I'm pretty sure that's how it happened.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.041
Pretty sure?

14:24.125 --> 14:28.000
I don't know exactly
because I wasn't with her at that time.

14:29.917 --> 14:33.250
Was anyone with her?

14:33.333 --> 14:37.375
An orderly, candy striper, anyone?

14:40.625 --> 14:43.834
No. She was alone.

14:46.667 --> 14:49.583
Thank you so much.
That's all I needed to hear.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.375
Mrs. Solis.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.333
You can just toss that.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.583
Great. Just great.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.667
I think this is yours.

15:22.750 --> 15:27.583
Yeah. I've been looking for this one.
Thanks.

15:27.667 --> 15:30.917
I don't suppose you have
any idea where I found it?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.208
Those little suckers
are drawn to bare feet and car tires.

15:34.291 --> 15:37.250
Since you're not limping or bleeding...

15:39.041 --> 15:42.208
This is only temporary.
You need to get it fixed.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.750
- Thanks, I will.
- Seriously, it's not safe.

15:44.834 --> 15:47.041
You'll only get
20 or 30 miles out of it.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.041
All right, I promise.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.750
Hey, listen.
I'm about to break for lunch.

15:51.834 --> 15:53.959
- How would you like to join me?
- Lunch?

15:54.041 --> 15:55.917
Yeah, lunch.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.709
Are you asking me out on a date?

15:59.792 --> 16:05.792
That sounds kinda formal for a burrito
and a can of soda, but I guess I am.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.500
Aren't you dating Edie?

16:07.583 --> 16:10.834
We went out on a date. We're not dating.

16:10.917 --> 16:13.083
So how about it? I'm buying.

16:13.166 --> 16:16.417
I just got out of this relationship
with this guy, Mike.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.375
It's kind of complicated.

16:18.458 --> 16:22.834
Anyway, I'm not sure where I am right
now, emotionally. I'm all jumbled up.

16:22.917 --> 16:26.417
I can't leap into something new,
relationship-wise, at the moment.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.959
Again, just a burrito.

16:30.792 --> 16:33.333
- I'm sorry.
- OK, I understand.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.750
Sounds like you need time
to reflect and heal.

16:35.834 --> 16:38.250
- I do, I really do.
- OK.

16:38.333 --> 16:41.375
I'll check back with you again tomorrow.

16:42.917 --> 16:45.667
This is so delicious.

16:45.750 --> 16:48.959
I don't know how you find the time,
with four kids.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.875
Only for first-time guests.

16:50.959 --> 16:55.083
Normally, you'd be having chicken
fingers and cartoon-shaped macaroni.

16:55.166 --> 16:57.875
- If that.
- Hey, shut up.

16:57.959 --> 17:01.792
Tom, you're in advertising, right?

17:01.875 --> 17:05.333
I worked five years at Simon and Scott.

17:05.417 --> 17:07.792
I started at Simon and Scott.

17:09.417 --> 17:12.208
I hated those guys.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.375
- We have to talk.
- Yes...

17:15.458 --> 17:17.542
Who do you know there now?

17:17.625 --> 17:21.542
It's all over now. They'll be
talking shop for the rest of the night.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.750
Alisa loves talking about Alisa.

17:24.834 --> 17:27.500
Well, Lynette loves
talking about Lynette too.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.458
I don't believe that for a second.

17:29.542 --> 17:33.250
You and your husband seem pretty solid.

17:33.333 --> 17:37.250
We're going through some tough stuff.
We're in counseling.

17:38.709 --> 17:42.000
- Really? More steak?
- It's her idea.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.917
It's not the most pleasant way
to spend an hour.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.417
Basically, I look at the clock
and she blames me for everything.

17:48.500 --> 17:53.625
I don't think you should be talking
about Alisa with her so...

17:53.709 --> 17:56.792
It's OK, it's not like she can hear.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.959
Maybe I will have some more
of that potato stuff.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.667
He actually said those things,
with her sitting right there?

18:06.750 --> 18:10.417
It was really nasty,
and he wouldn't shut up, either.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.709
I can't believe you said
we'd play tennis.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.792
That was before I knew he was a jerk.
She was great.

18:15.875 --> 18:17.542
Look what she taught me.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.583
It means "I love you."

18:21.667 --> 18:24.458
That's great. What am I gonna do?

18:26.291 --> 18:28.917
- What do you mean?
- Obviously she needs to be told.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.250
No, she doesn't.
This is between Dennis and Alisa.

18:32.333 --> 18:36.291
How can I ignore this? And I quote:
"It's not like she can hear."

18:36.375 --> 18:40.959
Lynette, you're starting to ramp up
into that whole meddling thing you do.

18:41.041 --> 18:42.792
- Excuse me?
- Let me handle it.

18:42.875 --> 18:45.000
Let's avoid a big thing.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.834
Are you saying I can't be tactful?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.625
If he says something at tennis,

18:48.709 --> 18:51.792
I will take him aside, man to man,
and say, "That's not cool."

18:51.875 --> 18:53.917
Are you saying I'm not tactful?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.083
Andrew, I need you
to take out the trash.

19:17.834 --> 19:21.250
- Sure.
- Now, not five hours from now.

19:22.417 --> 19:25.667
I'm going. God...

19:27.458 --> 19:31.291
I'm meeting Justin at the mall tonight
so I'm gonna need 40 bucks.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.083
No.

19:33.166 --> 19:36.291
- What?
- You no longer get an allowance.

19:37.917 --> 19:41.125
Fine. I'm not taking out the trash.

19:41.208 --> 19:42.208
Andrew.

19:42.291 --> 19:45.500
What are you gonna do? Torture me?
Go ahead, I can take it.

19:46.583 --> 19:50.458
What I want, what I have always wanted,
is for you to be happy.

19:50.542 --> 19:54.083
And you're not,
and I have no idea how to help you.

19:54.166 --> 19:57.083
You could start
by getting out of the way.

19:57.166 --> 20:00.208
I will not.
We're gonna talk about this now.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.667
I said, get out of the way.

20:07.083 --> 20:10.458
Next time you touch your mother,
I'll throw you through this wall.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.625
You understand me?

20:35.542 --> 20:38.500
Edie, wait up.
I wanna ask you something.

20:38.583 --> 20:41.250
I can't stop.
I gotta keep my heart rate up.

20:41.333 --> 20:45.542
I was just wondering how you'd feel
if I went out with Bill.

20:45.625 --> 20:48.458
- What?
- Bill asked me out.

20:48.542 --> 20:51.625
- Bill? My Bill?
- See, that's the thing.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.792
He doesn't think of himself
as your Bill.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.125
He said that date
was just a one-time thing.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.083
Which I know,
because when he asked me out

20:59.166 --> 21:01.792
I told him I thought
you guys were involved.

21:01.875 --> 21:06.208
- You haven't agreed to go out with him?
- No, I wanted to check with you first.

21:06.291 --> 21:09.208
Wow, that's nice of you.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.500
- So, can I?
- No.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.500
Edie, why can't I go out with him?

21:15.583 --> 21:17.542
Because I saw him first.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.291
That's a really
third-grade thing to say.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.709
You asked my permission, I said no.
That should be the end of it.

21:24.792 --> 21:27.417
Technically,
I don't need your permission.

21:30.583 --> 21:35.417
I so much wanna like you,
but you just won't let me.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.625
I try. I try to look past your flaws.

21:40.709 --> 21:45.667
Your klutziness.
That faux vulnerability. Your hair.

21:45.750 --> 21:49.458
But you look for ways
to push my buttons.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.041
He just wants to buy me a burrito.

21:52.125 --> 21:55.792
Susan, please. Let me like you.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.125
OK. I won't go out with him.

22:00.208 --> 22:03.291
I mean, obviously,
you have feelings for him.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.750
No, I don't. I really don't.

22:06.709 --> 22:11.000
So what, then?
If you can't have him, nobody can?

22:11.083 --> 22:14.083
See? Now you're thinking like a friend.

22:27.291 --> 22:28.875
What a voice.

22:28.959 --> 22:32.750
You have to hand it to the Catholics.
They do grief better than anyone.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.750
How much did that horse and buggy
set us back?

22:39.834 --> 22:42.625
- Do you mind?
- Being poor? A little.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.166
Eyes front, Padre.

22:54.208 --> 22:58.542
I can't believe Edie. She doesn't have
dibs on every man on the planet.

22:58.625 --> 23:01.417
If I want to go out with Bill,
I should be able to.

23:01.500 --> 23:04.333
- I thought you weren't even into him.
- Neither is she.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.834
If she's not into him,
why can't I not be into him?

23:09.166 --> 23:11.166
I'm gonna mourn now.

23:15.709 --> 23:19.792
- Why are we slowing down?
- Because we're almost there.

23:24.041 --> 23:25.083
What is that?

23:25.166 --> 23:29.375
The family who owned it couldn't afford
the maintenance. I got an amazing deal.

23:29.458 --> 23:33.041
- You bought your mother a crypt?
- Quiet. You're making a scene.

23:33.125 --> 23:36.625
That's it.
I cannot be a part of this.

23:36.709 --> 23:39.125
- I can't do it.
- Gabrielle.

23:40.667 --> 23:43.125
Stop acting like a child.

23:47.125 --> 23:50.125
Are we supposed to be following them?

23:50.208 --> 23:52.959
I don't know.
Maybe it's part of the ritual.

23:53.041 --> 23:55.333
Go to hell, Carlos.

23:57.125 --> 23:59.834
All right, people,
we're going to follow the body.

23:59.917 --> 24:01.959
This way, please. Come along.

24:03.417 --> 24:06.250
This is too much.
I agreed to give up the house

24:06.333 --> 24:09.291
because I thought I'd get
a gorgeous little apartment.

24:09.375 --> 24:12.625
- Now I won't even get that.
- What do you want me to do?

24:12.709 --> 24:15.291
- Take the plea.
- What?

24:15.375 --> 24:17.834
You did the crime.
Why should I pay the price?

24:17.917 --> 24:20.417
Just suck it up,
be a man and do the time.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.375
- You're being ridiculous.
- Am I?

24:22.458 --> 24:25.709
All I want is the same respect
you gave your dead mother.

24:25.792 --> 24:29.291
- Gabby, please.
- At least she has a roof over her head.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.834
Fifteen all.

24:46.083 --> 24:48.375
Was that in?

24:48.458 --> 24:52.250
- Nice try.
- Alisa, you're deaf, not blind.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.208
It was a close call.

24:56.291 --> 24:58.250
That's telling him.

24:58.333 --> 25:00.583
I'm waiting for my moment.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.709
Think her tennis stinks?
You should try her cooking.

25:06.208 --> 25:08.917
Fifteen thirty.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.291
Sorry.

25:16.417 --> 25:20.417
I should have mentioned that my tennis
is much better than my cooking.

25:25.667 --> 25:26.750
Hey.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.875
That was fun. You play really well.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.041
Thank you.

25:30.125 --> 25:33.834
Gimme a break.
She serves underhand, for God's sake.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.667
- What's your problem?
- Excuse me?

25:41.750 --> 25:44.792
Do you have
any bottled water over there?

25:44.875 --> 25:48.375
My electrolytes get all wacky
when I sweat.

25:48.458 --> 25:51.125
She's your wife.
How can you talk about her like that?

25:51.208 --> 25:55.625
Let me tell you what St Alisa is saying
with that phony smile on her face.

25:55.709 --> 26:00.250
"Move your ass, Dennis."
"Nice love handles, Dennis."

26:00.333 --> 26:02.333
"Try switching deodorant, Dennis."

26:02.417 --> 26:05.250
Enough. If you've got issues
with your wife, tell her.

26:05.333 --> 26:09.291
- We're in counseling.
- It's not working too well, is it?

26:09.375 --> 26:12.375
If you're unhappy,
do something instead of complaining.

26:12.458 --> 26:14.875
'Cause, frankly,
I don't want to hear it.

26:14.959 --> 26:18.166
Hey, let's trade partners.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.583
- Sure.
- Great.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.667
Thanks.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.875
I'll play with you.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.792
Hey.

26:28.875 --> 26:31.542
Hey. You did not take this in.

26:31.625 --> 26:35.291
This should hold,
but you've got to take it in.

26:35.375 --> 26:39.083
Thank you. I know. I'm going to.
It's on the top of my list.

26:41.250 --> 26:42.917
That was hard work.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.959
Would you like a glass of water

26:45.041 --> 26:47.709
and maybe an excuse
to come in and talk to me?

26:47.792 --> 26:49.291
Sounds great.

26:52.375 --> 26:54.250
So, it's tomorrow.

26:54.333 --> 26:57.000
I told you
I'd check back in on that date.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.667
Bill...

26:59.750 --> 27:02.291
I have my reasons.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.834
Am I hideous?

27:05.917 --> 27:07.500
Oh, God, no.

27:07.583 --> 27:11.959
No, you are just
so incredibly not hideous.

27:12.041 --> 27:14.500
Thank you. I think.

27:14.583 --> 27:17.834
See, maybe it's the word "date"
that's throwing me off.

27:17.917 --> 27:21.500
Look, I just want to have some fun,
you know? Dinner, drinks...

27:23.667 --> 27:26.166
No strings attached.

27:31.625 --> 27:33.375
OK, I'll go out with you.

27:33.458 --> 27:37.667
Great. I know this little place
out of the way. You're gonna love it.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.709
What are you doing?

27:44.792 --> 27:47.041
Making an emergency list for you.

27:47.125 --> 27:51.250
So you'll know who to call in case the
roof leaks, or the power goes out...

27:51.333 --> 27:52.792
Why?

27:54.750 --> 27:57.458
I'm taking the plea bargain.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.250
So you can keep the house.

28:03.417 --> 28:09.041
I buried my mother with respect,
and I don't regret a single penny.

28:09.125 --> 28:14.166
But I got us into the position we're in,
and the moment I did,

28:14.250 --> 28:16.250
I stopped respecting you.

28:19.875 --> 28:23.583
- And that's not right.
- You're so brave.

28:27.083 --> 28:29.709
It's not without strings.

28:32.125 --> 28:35.750
I need you to promise
you're gonna be here when I get out.

28:35.834 --> 28:39.083
That's a ridiculous thing to say.
I'm not going anywhere.

28:39.166 --> 28:43.208
And I need you to promise
that you'll be faithful while I'm gone.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.250
Yeah. Of course.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.834
Gabrielle, I'm no fool.

28:49.291 --> 28:52.250
You're a beautiful woman
and I understand you have needs.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.375
But I'm a very jealous
and possessive man.

28:55.458 --> 28:59.000
And I need to hear you say it.

29:00.542 --> 29:02.709
I promise.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.166
OK, then.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.959
Tomorrow morning,
we'll go and see the lawyers.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.917
I love you.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.041
I love you too.

29:24.542 --> 29:29.291
And just so you know,
I'm gonna hold you to that promise.

29:37.041 --> 29:40.417
What's going on? Did Grandma die?

29:40.500 --> 29:44.375
No, she's fine. Listen, Andrew...

29:44.458 --> 29:48.709
Sweetheart, it's been clear to us for
some time now that you've been unhappy.

29:48.792 --> 29:52.000
- All this acting out.
- The pot smoking, the violence...

29:52.083 --> 29:56.000
It just isn't you. And we feel
that you need to spend some quality time

29:56.083 --> 29:59.291
thinking about the goals in your life

29:59.375 --> 30:02.375
and what kind of person you want to be.

30:02.458 --> 30:05.583
What the hell are you talking about?

30:06.375 --> 30:09.000
There's this place
called Camp Hennessey.

30:09.083 --> 30:13.500
It's designed for teenagers
like yourself who've lost their way.

30:13.583 --> 30:15.000
You gotta be kidding.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.959
They emphasize
discipline and responsibility,

30:18.041 --> 30:20.083
two things you're sorely in need of.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.333
You'll only be there a few weeks.

30:22.417 --> 30:26.458
You can stop this now. I'm not going to
a stupid camp for juvenile delinquents.

30:30.333 --> 30:34.125
- We're ready.
- Sorry, honey, you don't have a choice.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.125
- Get your hands off of me.
- Take it easy.

30:46.208 --> 30:47.959
It's no use fighting.

30:48.041 --> 30:51.166
These gentlemen will help you dress
and drive you to the camp.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.709
- We can take it from here.
- Wait.

30:54.792 --> 30:58.709
- Mom, wait. Please, I'm sorry.
- Honey, it's gonna be OK, I promise.

31:00.709 --> 31:02.709
- This was your idea.
- Why, you...

31:02.792 --> 31:04.792
Stop it.

31:05.583 --> 31:10.625
Honey, no matter what you say or do,
I will always love you.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.041
Let's go. Come on.

31:21.542 --> 31:24.000
What's that for?

31:24.083 --> 31:27.041
For being here.

31:27.125 --> 31:30.542
For standing by me through this.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.834
You don't know what it means to me, Rex.

31:35.083 --> 31:39.709
It's been a long time
since I felt like I had a real partner.

31:39.792 --> 31:43.417
And it really helps, especially
on a horrible morning like this.

31:52.542 --> 31:55.583
Hey, Alisa. Hey, Lily. How are you guys?

31:55.667 --> 31:57.709
May I speak to you, please?

31:57.792 --> 32:00.208
Sure. Boys, here.

32:00.291 --> 32:02.041
Stay right there.

32:02.125 --> 32:03.375
Yes, Mom.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.500
- So how are you?
- Dennis left me.

32:07.583 --> 32:08.917
What?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.500
Dennis left me.

32:11.583 --> 32:12.834
Why?

32:12.917 --> 32:15.000
You told him to, you moron.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.542
- I'm sorry?
- You talked about our marriage.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.458
- It's none of your business.
- Stop.

32:19.542 --> 32:23.041
I can't understand you.
You're gonna have to talk slower.

32:36.083 --> 32:41.000
Dennis said you yelled at him
for saying stuff behind my back.

32:41.083 --> 32:43.083
Well, yeah.

32:43.166 --> 32:47.000
And he said you told him
our counseling wasn't working.

32:47.083 --> 32:49.959
That's not exactly what I...

32:50.041 --> 32:53.667
Where the hell do you come off
telling people to stop counseling?

32:53.750 --> 32:56.125
- I didn't mean...
- Sure,

32:56.208 --> 33:01.375
we have our share of problems,
financial, emotional, sexual.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.542
But we were solving them.

33:06.208 --> 33:07.583
Alisa, come here.

33:11.583 --> 33:17.333
Are you sure you wanna be saying
these things in front of your daughter?

33:17.417 --> 33:20.333
Now you're telling me
how to raise my daughter?

33:21.542 --> 33:23.834
Lily, we're coming back.

33:24.959 --> 33:29.041
Alisa, I am so sorry
if I caused a problem.

33:29.125 --> 33:31.250
I just wanted to help.

33:31.333 --> 33:33.333
Why? Why did you want to help?

33:33.417 --> 33:36.667
- Well, because...
- Because I was deaf?

33:36.750 --> 33:40.125
No. Because your husband
was being a total jerk.

33:42.709 --> 33:47.583
And you've just gotta come in on your
white horse and come to the rescue.

33:47.667 --> 33:51.583
Well, guess what?
I didn't need to be rescued. Got that?

33:51.667 --> 33:53.959
I didn't need to be rescued.

33:59.917 --> 34:01.500
Bitch.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.834
She said...

34:04.917 --> 34:07.125
Yes, thank you.
I know what she just said.

34:10.625 --> 34:13.875
One minute we're making out
in his truck and next thing I know,

34:13.959 --> 34:17.583
we're at the hospital and the doctor's
digging a bullet out of him.

34:17.667 --> 34:21.291
When I started dating Mike,
he seemed like such a normal guy.

34:21.375 --> 34:24.583
They always do.
You wanna get some nachos?

34:24.667 --> 34:27.250
Obviously,
I am not going to read the letter.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.917
At some point,
you've just gotta let it go, right?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.083
Right.

34:31.166 --> 34:34.583
Mind if we leave off the jalapenos?
I'm not good with spicy things.

34:34.667 --> 34:37.000
I don't mean to babble.
It's complicated.

34:37.083 --> 34:40.834
And there is so much about Mike
you don't even know.

34:40.917 --> 34:44.041
That would surprise me at this point.

34:46.750 --> 34:47.917
Edie.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.625
Your foreman said you were
on a date with a hottie.

34:50.709 --> 34:52.709
Evidently, someone needs Lasik.

34:52.792 --> 34:56.625
- You tracked us down?
- It wasn't hard.

34:56.709 --> 34:59.917
I just followed the stench of betrayal.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.792
- We had an agreement, Susan.
- No, we didn't.

35:02.875 --> 35:06.125
I said what you wanted to hear
because you guilted me into it.

35:06.208 --> 35:09.500
I was trying to protect
our already fragile friendship.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.333
- Am I in the middle of something here?
- Not any more.

35:12.417 --> 35:16.041
You, I will hate forever.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.083
And you are fired.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.166
Edie.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.667
You're firing me
for going out with Susan?

35:21.750 --> 35:26.709
Yes. And before you start whining
that dating her is punishment enough,

35:26.792 --> 35:29.083
save it.

35:35.250 --> 35:38.750
I suppose I could tell her
you threw yourself at me.

35:38.834 --> 35:41.750
You were lonely, begged to have dinner.
I took pity on you.

35:41.834 --> 35:46.834
Well, excuse me, but that kinda
makes it sound like it was my fault.

35:46.917 --> 35:50.333
You can't possibly blame me.
I'm not the one who fired you.

35:50.417 --> 35:54.750
You just chose not to tell me Edie would
be insanely mad if I went out with you.

35:54.834 --> 35:58.542
- Slow down. You're driving too fast.
- This is between you and Edie.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.458
I just got sucked into the drama.

36:00.542 --> 36:04.083
- Yeah. I bet you say that all the time.
- What does that mean?

36:04.166 --> 36:07.041
You didn't get sucked into the drama.
You invited it in.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.375
That's not true.

36:08.458 --> 36:11.583
You've spent an hour
obsessing over your ex-boyfriend,

36:11.667 --> 36:15.458
even though he's an ex-con who
very possibly strangled your neighbor.

36:15.542 --> 36:16.667
No, he didn't.

36:16.750 --> 36:20.542
And Edie told you not to go out with me,
but did you listen? No.

36:20.625 --> 36:24.333
You saw the potential for disaster
and couldn't resist getting in there.

36:24.417 --> 36:28.667
OK, Mr-let's-just-have-fun-
because-I'm-the-casual-contractor-man,

36:28.750 --> 36:31.041
you chased me, so own it, my friend.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.875
You didn't get that tire fixed,
did you?

36:52.875 --> 36:55.125
I was meaning to.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.166
I guess I do invite the drama in.

37:00.250 --> 37:02.333
Just a little.

37:07.709 --> 37:10.375
<i>Stocks closed up yesterday,</i>
<i>with investor...</i>

37:10.458 --> 37:13.667
Tom, am I a bad person?

37:17.625 --> 37:20.166
No. Why would you say that?

37:20.250 --> 37:22.917
I don't know. I guess
I just have it in my head

37:23.000 --> 37:27.750
that only bad people break up marriages
and offend the handicapped.

37:27.834 --> 37:31.250
- I did try to warn you.
- You did.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.792
Why do I do it?

37:33.875 --> 37:37.667
This compulsion to stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

37:37.750 --> 37:41.000
Honey, you were just
looking out for your friend.

37:41.083 --> 37:43.375
A lot of good it did her.

37:43.458 --> 37:46.625
At least you tried.
I admire you for that.

37:46.709 --> 37:48.208
Oh, please.

37:48.291 --> 37:51.542
Hey, I'm the guy
who let Dennis bad-mouth his wife

37:51.625 --> 37:53.792
because I was afraid of making a scene.

37:53.875 --> 37:56.291
You knew it was wrong
and you let him have it.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.917
That's me.
I'm never afraid to create a scene.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.792
Honey, my point is, you have
a strong sense of what is right

38:04.875 --> 38:07.709
and you're not afraid to act on it.

38:07.792 --> 38:10.250
And I admire you for that.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.750
You know what I admire you for?

38:14.458 --> 38:20.417
You find a way to compliment me
when you could say, "I told you so."

38:28.083 --> 38:30.875
You just signed "I told you so,"
didn't you?

38:30.959 --> 38:33.917
You'll never prove it.

38:38.458 --> 38:42.375
Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Solis.
I believe you've met Nurse Hisel?

38:42.458 --> 38:45.166
Yes. Hello. Again.

38:46.583 --> 38:50.166
Nurse Hisel became quite attached
to your mother-in-law.

38:50.250 --> 38:52.709
That's why I asked her
to be here for this.

38:52.792 --> 38:54.834
First, I want you to understand that

38:54.917 --> 38:57.959
we consider our commitment
to our patients a sacred trust.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
OK.

39:03.083 --> 39:08.417
Having said that, it appears
that there may, and I stress may,

39:08.500 --> 39:11.959
have been a breakdown
in our chain of care.

39:12.041 --> 39:16.375
I can assure you we hold our staff to
the highest standards in the industry.

39:16.458 --> 39:18.917
But we are only human after all.

39:21.083 --> 39:23.333
Honey, are you OK?

39:23.417 --> 39:26.333
Nurse Hisel, why don't you step out?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.125
I'm so sorry.

39:36.667 --> 39:39.166
We all share in your grief.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.959
Apparently.

39:42.041 --> 39:45.083
And we're hoping
to alleviate any further pain

39:45.166 --> 39:52.083
your family may suffer by offering
some monetary compensation.

39:53.834 --> 39:58.583
Provided you and your husband waive any
future right to litigation, of course.

39:58.667 --> 40:03.667
Monetary compensation?
You're trying to buy us off?

40:03.750 --> 40:07.000
Let's not get tangled up in legalese.

40:07.083 --> 40:11.041
We like to think of it
as an extension of our caring.

40:13.083 --> 40:16.709
Well, in that case, care away.

40:20.875 --> 40:24.542
Mr. Hartley, I have
a hypothetical legal question for you.

40:24.625 --> 40:28.667
I like to play the lottery and I...

40:28.750 --> 40:34.500
Yes, I know what the odds are
but I just love those scratch-offs.

40:34.583 --> 40:37.333
Say I were to win, I don't know,

40:37.417 --> 40:41.291
a million, six hundred thousand dollars.

40:41.375 --> 40:47.208
Would the government be able to take it
like they took everything else?

40:50.041 --> 40:52.750
That's what I thought. The bastards.

40:54.542 --> 40:59.166
So what if we won the lottery
after Carlos went to jail?

40:59.250 --> 41:02.709
Could the government
touch the money then? Hypothetically.

41:03.667 --> 41:05.834
I see.

41:05.917 --> 41:08.083
And we could keep the house.

41:14.583 --> 41:18.875
No, I'm just at the grocery store,
wondering if I should buy a ticket.

41:18.959 --> 41:21.792
Thanks a bunch, Mr. Hartley.

41:21.875 --> 41:25.625
So what time should I bring Carlos
to the DA's office tomorrow?

41:26.625 --> 41:28.041
Great.

41:33.792 --> 41:37.667
<i>We all honor heroes</i>
<i>for different reasons.</i>

41:37.750 --> 41:41.125
<i>Sometimes for their daring.</i>

41:46.125 --> 41:49.875
<i>Sometimes for their bravery.</i>

41:53.500 --> 41:56.875
<i>Sometimes for their goodness.</i>

41:56.959 --> 41:59.875
I love you.

42:05.125 --> 42:08.458
<i>But mostly, we honor heroes</i>

42:10.041 --> 42:13.083
<i>because at one point or another,</i>

42:13.166 --> 42:17.000
<i>we all dream of being rescued.</i>

42:23.333 --> 42:25.250
<i>Of course,</i>

42:25.333 --> 42:28.959
<i>if the right hero doesn't come along,</i>

42:29.041 --> 42:33.959
<i>sometimes,</i>
<i>we just have to rescue ourselves.</i>
