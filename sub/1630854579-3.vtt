[dramatic music]

00:58.161 --> 00:59.128
[dramatic music continues]

00:59.128 --> 01:00.646
- Acute radiation syndrome.

01:02.165 --> 01:04.961
That's the term the coroner
will use on his report.

01:04.961 --> 01:06.169
Just after the bit
where he calls this

01:06.169 --> 01:07.446
the most dangerous post-mortem

01:07.446 --> 01:09.241
ever undertaken in
the western world.

01:10.622 --> 01:12.658
You'll need a lead coffin
is the other thing.

01:12.658 --> 01:13.625
For the radiation.

01:15.316 --> 01:18.008
- So polonium poisoning?

01:18.008 --> 01:18.871
- Essentially.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.080
Pharyngeal damage,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.496
confirming the fact it
was ingested orally.

01:22.496 --> 01:23.911
Liver and kidneys
were worse affected,

01:23.911 --> 01:25.844
but all his organs
suffered severe atrophy

01:25.844 --> 01:30.090
resulting in an almost total
state of internal, you know...

01:31.194 --> 01:32.264
- No.

01:32.264 --> 01:33.093
- Well,

01:35.854 --> 01:36.682
sludge.

01:39.823 --> 01:41.273
- Right.

01:41.273 --> 01:42.102
Thank you.

01:47.797 --> 01:49.143
So what did they do it with?

01:49.143 --> 01:51.007
[dramatic music]

01:51.007 --> 01:52.664
- Sorry?

01:52.664 --> 01:54.459
- What did they use
to administer it?

01:55.391 --> 01:56.357
Or was it a bottle?

01:56.357 --> 01:58.670
Some sort of food stuff or...

01:58.670 --> 02:00.568
Probably none of our business.

02:00.568 --> 02:01.362
Sorry.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.089
- No, no, it's okay.

02:07.334 --> 02:08.266
It's more than okay.

02:08.266 --> 02:09.129
Thank you.

02:17.067 --> 02:20.554
[Geiger counter clicking]

02:24.765 --> 02:28.527
[speaking foreign language]

02:56.141 --> 02:58.764
- A guilty man
would never do that.

02:58.764 --> 03:00.041
- No.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.526
- Not unless he's
got a sick mind.

03:02.906 --> 03:04.149
- Exactly.

03:04.149 --> 03:05.288
- So, like I said, we're
gonna change the locks

03:05.288 --> 03:06.496
and the landline number.

03:06.496 --> 03:07.808
Not because anything
to worry about,

03:07.808 --> 03:09.016
it's more just
for peace of mind.

03:09.016 --> 03:10.914
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

03:10.914 --> 03:12.295
- And the name of the landlord?

03:12.295 --> 03:15.298
- Boris Berezovsky, he's
a friend of the family.

03:17.576 --> 03:20.269
- They can't get to you
here. Mrs. Litvinenko.

03:20.269 --> 03:21.822
- He's right.

03:21.822 --> 03:24.721
The people who did it are
thousands of miles away.

03:26.378 --> 03:29.243
[horns honking]

03:29.243 --> 03:31.901
- Olly, how long 'til
we get to the hotel?

03:31.901 --> 03:35.939
[speaking foreign language]

03:35.939 --> 03:36.768
[phone beeping]

03:36.768 --> 03:37.596
- Nearly there.

03:38.942 --> 03:40.496
- Oh, hang on, wrong phone.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.333
Right our contact
is Ingrid Campbell.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.749
She wants to meet
at noon tomorrow.

03:52.749 --> 03:54.579
- Funny place to
keep your mobile.

03:54.579 --> 03:56.443
- No, we've all got one.

03:56.443 --> 03:59.169
It's everything on these.

03:59.169 --> 04:01.241
Find two numbers
saved in the contacts.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.656
One's mine, the
other's each other's.

04:02.656 --> 04:04.002
That's all we'll ever need.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.556
Yeah, Campbell's
gonna introduce us

04:06.556 --> 04:08.178
to someone from the
prosecutor's office.

04:08.178 --> 04:11.354
- And they'll connect us
with Lugovoy and Kovtun?

04:11.354 --> 04:12.286
- Maybe.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.839
- Or at least someone who will.

04:13.839 --> 04:15.531
- Maybe, not necessarily.

04:15.531 --> 04:16.773
- Right.

04:16.773 --> 04:17.843
- Well we do know
where they are.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.605
Well, how we gonna
know they'll talk?

04:21.571 --> 04:22.848
- We don't.

04:22.848 --> 04:25.161
- You said the Russians
had agreed to cooperate.

04:25.161 --> 04:25.989
- They have.

04:25.989 --> 04:26.956
Whatever that means.

04:29.096 --> 04:31.685
Look, we are here
in their country

04:31.685 --> 04:33.549
asking for their help to prove

04:33.549 --> 04:36.103
that their people killed
someone on our patch.

04:36.103 --> 04:38.312
And we've got no guarantees
of getting anything.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.039
We're here purely and simply
because there's a chance.

04:42.523 --> 04:43.352
Okay?

04:45.250 --> 04:48.011
[dramatic music]

04:52.050 --> 04:53.707
- [Jim] Olly was saying
they've got all kinds here.

04:53.707 --> 04:56.019
They've got Top Shop, Body
Shop, they've got M&S.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.469
He's been here before.

04:57.469 --> 04:58.988
- [Tarpey] It's globalization.

04:58.988 --> 05:00.817
- Yeah but those are all the
things that we've given them.

05:00.817 --> 05:02.060
I mean, you tell me one thing

05:02.060 --> 05:03.510
the Russians have put
on our high street.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.374
- What, apart from
polonium you mean?

05:05.374 --> 05:06.996
You know, state
sponsored assassination

05:06.996 --> 05:09.309
coming soon to a
high street near you.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.069
That's proper globalization.

05:12.139 --> 05:15.901
[speaking foreign language]

05:25.221 --> 05:26.049
Hmm.

05:36.888 --> 05:40.132
[phone line crackling]

05:47.277 --> 05:49.901
[phone ringing]

05:49.901 --> 05:50.936
Hello?

05:50.936 --> 05:52.697
- [Jim] My burner's not working.

05:52.697 --> 05:53.525
Nor's Gadney's.

05:53.525 --> 05:54.423
- Nor's mine.

05:55.424 --> 05:56.597
- [Jim] You think it's them?

05:56.597 --> 05:58.358
- Oh, it's probably us.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.876
Us and our shitty phones.

06:00.843 --> 06:02.085
- [Jim] I didn't like the look

06:02.085 --> 06:03.570
of that bloke who
checked this in.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.330
- Well, the Russian
prosecutor knows we're here

06:05.330 --> 06:06.814
but that's it.

06:06.814 --> 06:10.335
Anyone else, this whole trip's
totally under the radar.

06:12.786 --> 06:13.649
You get some kip.

06:20.932 --> 06:23.417
- Moscow, MI6, radiation.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.938
Strip it all away
and what we've got

06:26.938 --> 06:30.390
is something that
everyone in this room

06:30.390 --> 06:32.875
has worked on dozens
of times before,

06:34.083 --> 06:34.911
a murder.

06:37.362 --> 06:41.504
We've got victim, crime scene,
we've even got suspects.

06:41.504 --> 06:45.577
But what we don't
have is a weapon.

06:45.577 --> 06:46.682
That's what's missing.

06:48.097 --> 06:51.134
You know we've got Colonel
Mustard, the ballroom,

06:51.134 --> 06:53.551
but using what, we don't know.

06:53.551 --> 06:54.897
- Yeah, we do though, don't we?

06:54.897 --> 06:55.829
It's polonium-210.

06:55.829 --> 06:57.106
- No, no, no.

06:57.106 --> 06:58.418
You see, hat's what
I've been thinking.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.040
But polonium's not the weapon.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.904
Polonium is just the
thing that killed him

07:01.904 --> 07:03.423
after they put it in his tea.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.391
- But we can link polonium
to Lugovoy and Kovtun

07:06.391 --> 07:07.357
because of the plane.

07:07.357 --> 07:09.152
- Yeah, but is that enough?

07:09.152 --> 07:11.741
That plane has been
in and out of Russia,

07:11.741 --> 07:14.744
the home of polonium,
since this happened.

07:15.918 --> 07:18.092
What's to stop the
Russians attributing

07:18.092 --> 07:19.818
polonium we found on the plane

07:19.818 --> 07:21.717
to any other person
on that plane

07:21.717 --> 07:23.960
who's come into contact with it?

07:23.960 --> 07:26.929
Look, we all agree that
polonium was in the tea.

07:26.929 --> 07:30.484
What we need to do is
find the item or items

07:30.484 --> 07:33.176
that the polonium was held in

07:33.176 --> 07:36.041
and we need to link
that to these two,

07:36.041 --> 07:40.390
Dmitry Kovtun and, most
importantly, Andrey Lugovoy.

07:40.390 --> 07:44.912
That way, anything they tell
Tarpey and the team in Moscow

07:44.912 --> 07:46.466
can be directly contradicted.

07:49.192 --> 07:50.262
Think of it this way,

07:51.471 --> 07:53.507
if polonium-210 is the bullet,

07:54.404 --> 07:56.165
what we need to find is the gun.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.893
- I want to lead on
the weapon search.

07:59.893 --> 08:02.482
Or whatever we're calling it.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.828
You had Tarpey lead on Moscow,

08:03.828 --> 08:05.761
despite him not
knowing the case.

08:05.761 --> 08:07.625
I can see how you
arrived at that decision,

08:07.625 --> 08:09.799
you two go way back and he's
trusted and what have you

08:09.799 --> 08:13.251
but I made a personal promise
to Marina Litvinenko and-

08:13.251 --> 08:14.079
- Great.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.600
I was gonna ask you anyway,

08:23.261 --> 08:24.193
Martin Svensson.

08:25.090 --> 08:26.367
- [Brent] Who?

08:26.367 --> 08:27.921
- He's the manager of
the Millennium Motel.

08:29.681 --> 08:30.510
Give him a ring.

08:31.718 --> 08:34.065
Tell him we're paying
him another visit.

08:34.065 --> 08:37.206
[dramatic music]

08:37.206 --> 08:40.865
[speaking foreign language]

08:48.597 --> 08:51.185
[door buzzing]

09:05.268 --> 09:07.857
[door buzzing]

09:10.929 --> 09:12.413
- Ms. Campbell.
- You're early.

09:12.413 --> 09:13.691
- Sorry.
- No, it's good.

09:13.691 --> 09:15.831
The Russian prosecutor
got here an hour ago.

09:15.831 --> 09:17.971
All the usual cliches
apply I'm afraid.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.386
If you're early,
they're earlier.

09:19.386 --> 09:21.250
If you're on time,
they'll keep you waiting.

09:21.250 --> 09:24.736
Your phones don't work but
is it them or is it you?

09:24.736 --> 09:25.565
- And.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.427
- I'm sorry.

09:26.427 --> 09:27.981
- Which is it?

09:27.981 --> 09:29.465
- Them, probably.

09:29.465 --> 09:30.880
As my predecessor used to say,

09:30.880 --> 09:32.848
if they'd included mind
games in the Moscow Olympics,

09:32.848 --> 09:34.263
they'd have swept the board.

09:44.445 --> 09:48.001
Gentlemen, Nika Privalova
from the prosecutor's office.

09:48.001 --> 09:51.763
[speaking foreign language]

09:54.421 --> 09:56.112
- Then let's do it in English.

09:57.597 --> 10:01.497
You want to interview Andrey
Lugovoy y Dmitri Kovtun, da?

10:01.497 --> 10:02.705
- That is correct.

10:02.705 --> 10:05.570
And we thank you for
your help in this.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.780
- You have list of questions?

10:08.780 --> 10:10.333
- Well, there are certain things

10:10.333 --> 10:12.715
we'll be looking to talk
to them about, certainly.

10:12.715 --> 10:14.337
- You need list of questions.

10:14.337 --> 10:16.063
You give questions to me.

10:16.063 --> 10:18.307
After this, we arrange.

10:18.307 --> 10:20.033
- So you know where they are?

10:20.033 --> 10:21.137
- Yes.

10:21.137 --> 10:23.139
- And we can definitely
talk to them?

10:23.139 --> 10:24.796
- Lugovoy, yes, no problem.

10:25.797 --> 10:27.212
- And Kovtun?

10:27.212 --> 10:28.628
- Kovtun

10:28.628 --> 10:29.629
Yes.

10:30.733 --> 10:34.150
But Kovtun, you have
to be very fast.

10:34.150 --> 10:36.118
Kovtun is serious.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.639
- How do you mean, serious?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.400
- Kovtun is sick.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.401
From polonium.

10:44.713 --> 10:46.266
- Just to be clear,

10:46.266 --> 10:50.166
you're saying that Kovtun
has also been poisoned?

10:50.166 --> 10:51.685
- Yes.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.895
- As in, he's ingested
some polonium accidentally?

10:54.895 --> 10:56.690
- No.
[dramatic music]

10:56.690 --> 10:59.589
Kovtun is a victim of poison.

10:59.589 --> 11:00.418
- By whom?

11:00.418 --> 11:02.247
By Lugovoy?

11:02.247 --> 11:03.835
- No.

11:03.835 --> 11:05.837
By Alexander Litvinenko.

11:12.775 --> 11:15.053
- Number four,
describe the reasons

11:15.053 --> 11:16.158
for your meetings
with Litvinenko

11:16.158 --> 11:17.677
in October, November this year.

11:18.781 --> 11:19.955
Number five,

11:19.955 --> 11:21.611
can you give an account
for your movements

11:21.611 --> 11:23.234
on the afternoon
of November 1st?

11:23.234 --> 11:24.407
- All right, that's the one.

11:24.407 --> 11:26.340
That's the one we
definitely need to ask.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.273
That's our best chance
to trip them up.

11:28.273 --> 11:29.102
- Yeah.

11:30.759 --> 11:34.141
[keypad beeping]

11:34.141 --> 11:36.661
- So the plan is
to meet Privalova,

11:36.661 --> 11:38.732
give her the questions
and following in convoy

11:38.732 --> 11:40.907
to the hospital to
see Dmitri Kovtun.

11:43.841 --> 11:45.532
You need to make a phone call.

11:45.532 --> 11:46.706
- Yeah.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.017
- The one on the
right, the red phone.

11:48.017 --> 11:49.087
That's secure.
[dramatic music]

11:49.087 --> 11:49.881
- Thank you.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.025
- Nice one, this is huge.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.270
Just remember Tarpey,
it's worth nothing

11:59.270 --> 12:00.305
unless it's on tape.

12:02.549 --> 12:04.033
- I know you know.

12:04.033 --> 12:07.312
It's just good to remind
ourselves of these things.

12:09.418 --> 12:10.730
Right, good man.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.424
Kovtun, they're
interviewing him tonight.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.082
Finally we're getting somewhere.

12:20.325 --> 12:22.258
- Certainly sir, if
you don't mind waiting.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.781
- Guess they want me
to wait in the bar.

12:31.371 --> 12:32.752
- This is the one.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.339
This was the table.

12:35.996 --> 12:37.998
- So this was Litvinenko's seat?

12:37.998 --> 12:39.206
- No, this is.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.691
You're in Lugovoy's.

12:42.623 --> 12:44.039
He was sitting where you are.

12:45.143 --> 12:47.214
Confident, relaxed.

12:47.214 --> 12:49.423
Eyes on the door, waiting.

12:49.423 --> 12:51.978
Then I'd have come
in, hurried in,

12:51.978 --> 12:53.634
'cause you brought
the meeting forward.

12:53.634 --> 12:56.706
Sat down to find the
tea already here.

12:56.706 --> 12:58.018
Already ordered.

12:58.018 --> 12:59.848
Already getting cold.

12:59.848 --> 13:01.021
- So why drink it?

13:02.402 --> 13:04.611
You knew the risks, you
didn't consume anything

13:04.611 --> 13:05.957
you hadn't bought yourself

13:05.957 --> 13:08.788
at your lunch with Scaramella
a few hours before.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.479
So why, why,

13:10.479 --> 13:13.585
in here, did you drink?

13:13.585 --> 13:15.173
- Cause you're my boss.

13:15.173 --> 13:16.761
- No Lugovoy wasn't
Litvinenko's boss.

13:16.761 --> 13:19.660
- Not boss but,
you know, superior.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.491
An alpha male.

13:22.491 --> 13:25.805
You exert a certain level of
social control over others.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.047
Men your own age.

13:28.531 --> 13:32.950
And when you ask people to do
things, they tend to do them.

13:36.091 --> 13:38.300
- Are we still talking
about Lugovoy, Brent?

13:41.648 --> 13:43.650
- Can I get you
gentlemen a drink?

13:43.650 --> 13:45.376
- No, thank you.
- I'll have...

13:45.376 --> 13:49.069
We're actually
waiting for someone.

13:49.069 --> 13:51.623
In fact, here he is look.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.281
[horn sounding]

14:11.436 --> 14:12.852
- [Tarpey] You all right?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.232
- Well if he has been poisoned,
he's in the right place.

14:14.232 --> 14:15.475
Hospital No. 6 is where

14:15.475 --> 14:17.373
they treated the
victims of Chernobyl.

14:17.373 --> 14:19.203
Oh, she also told me
that, under Russian law,

14:19.203 --> 14:21.826
all police interviews must
be completed by 10:00 PM.

14:23.069 --> 14:24.553
- Why is that even a rule?

14:24.553 --> 14:26.417
- Get in Tarps.
- Fine.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.661
- Can't get through tonight,
we'll come back tomorrow.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.560
- Not an option either.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.113
His health's getting
worse apparently.

14:33.113 --> 14:35.702
They're making it very
clear this is a one off.

14:35.702 --> 14:37.842
You're lucky to be
seeing you at all.

14:37.842 --> 14:39.085
- Come on!

14:39.085 --> 14:40.880
They wanna help or not?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.260
It's nearly seven.

14:42.260 --> 14:44.297
Cutting it a bit fine.

14:44.297 --> 14:45.505
Could you ask him

14:45.505 --> 14:46.713
how long it's gonna take
to get there please?

14:46.713 --> 14:50.441
[speaking foreign language]

14:51.925 --> 14:53.444
- 20 minutes, apparently.

14:55.446 --> 14:59.174
[speaking foreign language]

15:00.900 --> 15:02.108
- What?

15:02.108 --> 15:03.109
What does that mean?

15:06.319 --> 15:09.011
- Every guest has one glass
and one cup in their room

15:09.011 --> 15:11.807
to make tea or coffee
or whatever they like.

15:11.807 --> 15:13.533
- And these are the
same cups and glasses

15:13.533 --> 15:14.914
you use in the restaurant?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.330
- Same as restaurant,
same as Pine Bar.

15:18.676 --> 15:20.160
- So, how many are we talking?

15:26.166 --> 15:27.754
- And these are
just a clean ones?

15:30.757 --> 15:32.414
Well, you asked for it Brent.

15:34.174 --> 15:35.106
Let's get cracking.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.839
- It's taking forever.

15:43.839 --> 15:46.152
This is a joke.

15:46.152 --> 15:47.429
20 minutes?

15:47.429 --> 15:49.500
It's been two hours!

15:49.500 --> 15:52.779
[speaking foreign language]

15:52.779 --> 15:53.814
- It's just up ahead.

15:54.884 --> 15:56.956
Okay, listen.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.509
Obviously they're running
the clock out on us

15:58.509 --> 16:01.098
so, when we get in there, we're
not gonna ask any questions,

16:01.098 --> 16:03.065
we're not gonna
complain about delays.

16:03.065 --> 16:05.171
That'll only cause more delays.

16:05.171 --> 16:08.139
So we just do as we're
told and we get on with it.

16:08.139 --> 16:09.313
- Apparently the hospital

16:09.313 --> 16:11.280
are providing hazmat
suits for you.

16:12.316 --> 16:13.144
- Okay.

16:16.113 --> 16:18.149
- I thought this was supposed
to be under the radar.

16:18.149 --> 16:19.047
[indistinct shouting]

16:19.047 --> 16:20.427
Ignore them.

16:20.427 --> 16:22.464
Let's push past the bullshit

16:22.464 --> 16:23.465
and get this done.

16:25.294 --> 16:30.299
[speaking foreign language]
[dramatic music]

16:46.867 --> 16:47.696
- Here.

16:47.696 --> 16:48.524
You change.

16:49.594 --> 16:52.045
But please, keep these outside.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.736
- We need to record
the interview.

16:53.736 --> 16:56.222
- We will record,
it's all prepared.

16:56.222 --> 16:57.154
- Okay.

16:57.154 --> 16:58.431
Then, after it's finished,

16:58.431 --> 16:59.363
we're gonna need a
copy of the tape.

16:59.363 --> 17:00.295
- [Privalova] No problem.

17:00.295 --> 17:01.330
- I need your guarantee on that.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.780
- No problem.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.955
But please, only two persons
inside the interview.

17:05.955 --> 17:06.887
- Two.

17:06.887 --> 17:08.096
- [Privalova] Two, it's a rule.

17:08.096 --> 17:09.062
- Whose rule, whose
rule is that now?

17:09.062 --> 17:10.029
- Tarps.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.789
Remember what you said.

17:11.789 --> 17:12.617
- Okay.

17:12.617 --> 17:13.860
Then, in that case,

17:13.860 --> 17:16.035
it will be DC Oliver
Gadney for his Russian

17:16.035 --> 17:19.348
and myself, DI Brian Tarpey.

17:19.348 --> 17:20.177
Thank you.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.943
Fast as we can boys.

17:39.679 --> 17:42.923
[indistinct muttering]

17:47.790 --> 17:48.791
- [Jim] Questions.

17:48.791 --> 17:49.896
- Thanks.

17:49.896 --> 17:52.071
Right, let's get in there.

18:21.928 --> 18:24.724
- Gentlemen, this
is Dmitry Kovtun.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.563
This is Dmitri Kovtun?

18:36.563 --> 18:38.151
- This is Dmitri Kovtun.

18:40.947 --> 18:42.121
- [Olly] Okay.

18:44.468 --> 18:48.196
[speaking foreign language]

18:53.925 --> 18:55.375
- If it was green tea,

18:55.375 --> 18:59.828
we can rule out the espresso
cups and the milk jugs.

18:59.828 --> 19:02.071
And the sugar bowls and
the sauce are unlikely

19:02.071 --> 19:05.937
to have had any direct contact
with any liquid, right?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.146
So what does that leave?

19:08.733 --> 19:11.046
- Tea pots, cups?

19:11.046 --> 19:13.531
- Does this mean we must
stop using these items?

19:13.531 --> 19:14.912
- It would be wise.

19:14.912 --> 19:17.259
- But we have been using
them all this time.

19:17.259 --> 19:18.847
- He's got a point.

19:18.847 --> 19:20.262
The poisoning took place when?

19:20.262 --> 19:21.574
November 1st?

19:21.574 --> 19:23.334
And what's the date today?

19:23.334 --> 19:25.164
- December 5th.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.132
- So during all that time, this
stuff's been in constant use

19:28.132 --> 19:30.548
and every time a cup gets
used, it gets washed?

19:31.998 --> 19:33.793
So, even if that's once a day,

19:33.793 --> 19:35.381
they'll still all
have been put through

19:35.381 --> 19:37.935
an industrial
strength dishwasher

19:37.935 --> 19:40.317
over 30 times since the
poisoning took place.

19:42.146 --> 19:44.976
And nobody who has drunk
from any of these cups

19:44.976 --> 19:46.875
has suffered any ill effects?

19:46.875 --> 19:48.394
- That we know of.

19:48.394 --> 19:49.981
- I'm thinking the chances of us

19:49.981 --> 19:52.812
getting any kind of
reading here are,

19:52.812 --> 19:55.366
well, ludicrously small.

19:56.471 --> 19:58.645
Feels like a waste of time.

19:58.645 --> 19:59.474
I'm sorry.

20:01.130 --> 20:04.789
[speaking foreign language]

21:10.752 --> 21:13.133
- [Jim] What a
total waste of time.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.239
- It's the bandages I don't get.

21:15.239 --> 21:16.378
- What the hell have bandages

21:16.378 --> 21:17.897
got to do with
polonium poisoning?

21:17.897 --> 21:19.381
- Well, Privalova says
she'll get us the tapes.

21:19.381 --> 21:22.281
She gave me her word,
whatever that means.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.593
Says she'll keep us
up to date on Lugovoy.

21:24.593 --> 21:26.630
- Oh, who's playing
him, Al Pacino?

21:28.873 --> 21:30.668
Lugovoy's the important one.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.119
He's the killer.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.362
I mean there.

21:34.362 --> 21:37.606
Physically there, at the
table, making it happen.

21:37.606 --> 21:40.402
If we can get him, and
I mean the real him,

21:40.402 --> 21:43.302
we get a statement, they
can't stop us using it.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.786
For all their f-ing about

21:44.786 --> 21:46.512
they can't stop us doing that
and using it against him.

21:46.512 --> 21:47.306
They just can't.

21:53.173 --> 21:55.175
[Tarpey groaning]
[dramatic music]

21:55.175 --> 21:56.694
- You alright mate?

21:56.694 --> 21:58.006
- What you want?

21:58.006 --> 22:00.733
You want a beer or a
water or something?

22:00.733 --> 22:01.665
- I'm fine.

22:03.839 --> 22:04.668
You guys carry on.

22:04.668 --> 22:05.496
I'll...

22:07.326 --> 22:08.499
Just get hold of Clive.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.434
All right mate, sleep well.

22:48.159 --> 22:51.093
[Tarpey vomiting]

22:54.890 --> 22:56.444
- [Radio] We'll be
examining the impact

22:56.444 --> 22:59.101
of Mr. Litvinenko's death
on relations with Russia.

22:59.101 --> 23:01.069
Britain's former
ambassador to Moscow

23:01.069 --> 23:02.760
tells us the
political relationship

23:02.760 --> 23:05.591
between Russia and the
West is at its lowest point

23:05.591 --> 23:07.662
since the collapse
of the Soviet Union.

23:10.009 --> 23:11.666
- Can you leave that?

23:11.666 --> 23:13.875
- It's a table, it's not a desk.

23:13.875 --> 23:15.497
Last time I checked.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.016
- I work from home Brent.

23:17.016 --> 23:17.844
- I know.

23:19.018 --> 23:20.985
- We don't have an office.

23:20.985 --> 23:23.816
- No we don't, we could.

23:23.816 --> 23:25.231
- That's the nursery.

23:25.231 --> 23:28.993
- Yeah but it's not
a nursery is it?

23:28.993 --> 23:31.133
- We said while there's
a chance it might be,

23:31.133 --> 23:35.034
even if it's only a tiny
chance, we should wait.

23:35.034 --> 23:36.104
- Yes, while-

23:36.104 --> 23:37.830
- As long as it takes.

23:38.693 --> 23:40.280
That's what we said.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.627
You promised.

23:41.627 --> 23:43.249
- [TV] Absolutely, yes.

23:43.249 --> 23:45.734
But I mean as President
Putin himself said yesterday,

23:45.734 --> 23:47.426
so far, there isn't any...

23:53.604 --> 23:55.157
- Everything all right?

23:55.157 --> 23:57.332
- I've been trying to
get a hold of Brian.

23:57.332 --> 24:00.369
[phone line beeping]

24:01.750 --> 24:06.410
- Just give me a sec.

24:06.410 --> 24:09.171
[dramatic music]

24:19.043 --> 24:21.321
[knocking]

24:27.396 --> 24:28.639
Tarps!

24:28.639 --> 24:32.471
Tarps, it's me mate,
it's time to get up.

24:45.863 --> 24:46.692
All right?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.765
- [Ingrid] It won't be polonium.

24:50.765 --> 24:52.214
- [Tarpey] Yeah, you still
think it was deliberate.

24:52.214 --> 24:53.422
- If it was, it's just their way

24:53.422 --> 24:55.010
of putting the shits up you.

24:55.010 --> 24:58.980
- Well, without oversharing,
it did the direct opposite.

24:58.980 --> 24:59.808
I can tell you.

25:00.913 --> 25:01.810
Thank you.

25:05.573 --> 25:09.093
Anyway, why were you at the
hotel in the first place?

25:09.093 --> 25:10.370
- I couldn't reach you by phone.

25:10.370 --> 25:11.510
- Why were you
trying to ring me?

25:11.510 --> 25:12.994
- Because Privalova's
contacted me.

25:12.994 --> 25:14.582
She's been in
touch with Lugovoy.

25:14.582 --> 25:15.859
- And?

25:15.859 --> 25:17.101
- [Ingrid] He'll see
you later on today.

25:17.101 --> 25:18.827
Apparently he's
very keen to help.

25:18.827 --> 25:21.658
[dramatic music]

25:23.211 --> 25:24.143
- I've gotta get
back to the hotel,

25:24.143 --> 25:26.317
start prepping the questions.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.803
First, I need to
use the red phone.

25:33.601 --> 25:36.293
[phone ringing]

25:38.364 --> 25:39.296
- Timmons.

25:39.296 --> 25:40.539
- We've got him, Lugovoy.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.988
He's talking to
us five, our time.

25:41.988 --> 25:43.576
The interview with Kovtum
was a complete farce.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.233
He turned up
covered in bandages.

25:45.233 --> 25:46.268
I'm not sure it was even him.

25:46.268 --> 25:47.442
- How's this any different?

25:47.442 --> 25:48.719
- He's asked to speak to us.

25:48.719 --> 25:49.720
- Oh right.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.550
Well, you know what to do.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.930
Get down there and get him

25:52.930 --> 25:54.656
on everything that
happened that day.

25:54.656 --> 25:55.623
And what else?

25:55.623 --> 25:56.520
- Get it all on tape.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.280
- Get it all on tape.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.074
Exactly.

25:59.074 --> 25:59.903
- On it guv.

26:09.395 --> 26:10.569
- It's about to go public

26:10.569 --> 26:13.123
that we're treating this
as a murder inquiry.

26:13.123 --> 26:14.193
- But we're not.

26:14.193 --> 26:15.574
- Internally we have been.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.541
- Yeah, but
externally we're not.

26:17.541 --> 26:18.818
We made sure not to do that

26:18.818 --> 26:20.924
because it would damage
our chances in Moscow.

26:20.924 --> 26:22.201
- I know.

26:22.201 --> 26:24.203
- We're asking for
their help, Peter.

26:24.203 --> 26:26.032
We're not accusing them,
well, not officially.

26:26.032 --> 26:27.413
- Clive, I know.

26:27.413 --> 26:30.416
- My lot are about
to question Lugovoy

26:30.416 --> 26:32.521
without knowing the
rest of the world

26:32.521 --> 26:34.765
thinks they're there
under false pretenses.

26:34.765 --> 26:36.008
I mean, who announced this?

26:36.008 --> 26:37.423
- [Peter] Nobody, it's a leak.

26:37.423 --> 26:38.597
- From who?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.357
Not everyone wants
us doing this.

26:40.357 --> 26:41.185
- Like who?

26:41.185 --> 26:42.670
- Does it matter?

26:42.670 --> 26:44.395
The fact is it's going out
on the news this afternoon.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.569
- Is it?

26:45.569 --> 26:46.984
How do you know?

26:46.984 --> 26:48.848
- Because ITN just called
me for confirmation.

26:48.848 --> 26:49.677
- Friggin...

26:56.822 --> 26:59.514
[phone ringing]

27:11.491 --> 27:14.494
[phoneline beeping]

27:16.358 --> 27:17.877
Tarpey's burner number.

27:17.877 --> 27:18.844
- Burners are broken.

27:18.844 --> 27:20.362
- What a...

27:20.362 --> 27:23.331
I need the number of the
Hotel Belorusskaya Duncan.

27:23.331 --> 27:24.850
Give me a minute.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.886
- The last email I sent you,
the hotel number's on there.

27:26.886 --> 27:27.715
- Right.

27:29.682 --> 27:30.579
- [Tarpey] Sorry.

27:32.616 --> 27:34.963
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

27:34.963 --> 27:36.447
Lugovoy,

27:36.447 --> 27:37.276
he's on.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.217
- We think they've
got Lugovoy but

27:47.217 --> 27:49.909
only if the media
don't screw it up.

27:52.532 --> 27:54.431
[phone ringing]

27:54.431 --> 27:55.674
[speaking foreign language]

27:55.674 --> 27:57.883
- Yeah, Brian Tarpey
please, room 614.

27:57.883 --> 28:00.644
Failing that, Jim Dawson or...

28:00.644 --> 28:01.749
Gadney?
- Oliver Gadney.

28:01.749 --> 28:02.681
- Oliver Gadney.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.096
- I'm sorry.

28:04.096 --> 28:05.338
I'm afraid none of those
guests are currently with us.

28:05.338 --> 28:06.823
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

28:06.823 --> 28:07.996
- No, no.

28:07.996 --> 28:08.790
Thank you.

28:16.039 --> 28:17.626
- Have you got a minute?

28:17.626 --> 28:18.420
- You know what?

28:20.871 --> 28:21.976
Suddenly I do.

28:25.048 --> 28:27.671
- "The chances of us
finding our weapon

28:27.671 --> 28:31.537
or getting any kind of a
reading are ludicrously small."

28:31.537 --> 28:34.678
That's the phrase the
woman from the HPA used.

28:34.678 --> 28:37.612
Then I was thinking,
ludicrously small,

28:37.612 --> 28:39.096
it's not zero, is it?

28:40.235 --> 28:44.446
And sometimes,
sometimes in life,

28:44.446 --> 28:47.726
just because the chances of
a positive outcome are small

28:47.726 --> 28:52.454
or take time does not mean
it's not worth trying, does it?

28:54.802 --> 28:56.458
- Okay.

28:56.458 --> 28:59.220
But let's have them
start with the teapots.

28:59.220 --> 29:02.879
The green tea was served in a
pot, that's what he told you.

29:02.879 --> 29:05.088
And there ain't
as many of those.

29:05.088 --> 29:06.365
- Guv, it's starting.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.098
- [TV] At around noon today,

29:15.098 --> 29:18.480
the Taliban in Southern
Helmand province.

29:19.827 --> 29:22.899
- Now, it was being treated
as a suspicious death.

29:22.899 --> 29:25.798
But in the last half hour,
Scotland Yard have confirmed

29:25.798 --> 29:27.282
that they are now
treating the poisoning

29:27.282 --> 29:29.250
of Alexander
Litvinenko as murder.

29:29.250 --> 29:30.907
- There you go, you see

29:30.907 --> 29:33.772
Russians ain't gonna like that.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.981
Brent, dind me that teapot.

29:39.916 --> 29:42.125
- The interview is off.
- Off?

29:42.125 --> 29:43.057
What do you mean off?

29:43.057 --> 29:44.955
- You said, "Unexplained death."

29:44.955 --> 29:45.956
- It is unexplained.

29:45.956 --> 29:47.578
- Now you're saying murder.

29:47.578 --> 29:48.856
- We're not calling it that.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.409
- Yes, you.

29:50.409 --> 29:51.859
British government.

29:51.859 --> 29:53.930
- Even if we did think that,
it makes no difference.

29:53.930 --> 29:55.207
Not to Lugovoy.

29:55.207 --> 29:57.243
- Mr. Lugovoy does
not do interview.

29:57.243 --> 30:00.522
- Mr. Lugovoy
denies murder, yeah?

30:00.522 --> 30:01.696
- Of course.

30:01.696 --> 30:03.663
- Mr. Lugovoy is
friend of Litvinenko?

30:03.663 --> 30:04.768
- Yes.

30:04.768 --> 30:05.942
- Then what difference
does it make

30:05.942 --> 30:06.770
what the British
government calls it?

30:06.770 --> 30:07.806
What anyone calls it?

30:07.806 --> 30:08.979
He can tell us what happened.

30:08.979 --> 30:10.809
He can set us straight.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.431
Or has he got something to hide?

30:16.538 --> 30:19.334
- Okay, you get changed.

30:19.334 --> 30:20.680
And wait.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.407
And please, two people only.

30:23.407 --> 30:25.099
- No, this time I need three.

30:25.099 --> 30:27.929
- If police wants to talk
to the patient, two only.

30:27.929 --> 30:28.896
- We didn't ask him.

30:28.896 --> 30:30.967
- It is a rule.
- He asked us.

30:43.082 --> 30:44.912
We're gonna need a
copy of that tape.

30:45.947 --> 30:47.259
- You will have.

31:23.709 --> 31:27.471
[speaking foreign language]

32:11.826 --> 32:14.553
- He recalls little
about the meeting.

32:16.348 --> 32:17.487
Not very memorable.

32:20.317 --> 32:22.147
- That's not true
is it Mr. Lugovoy?

32:23.044 --> 32:24.321
- I mean, this is the meeting

32:24.321 --> 32:26.082
where you were poisoned
by Alexander Litvinenko.

32:26.082 --> 32:29.844
[speaking foreign language]

32:29.844 --> 32:31.639
- You arranged the meeting.

32:31.639 --> 32:33.917
[speaking foreign language]

32:33.917 --> 32:35.919
- You ordered tea in advance.

32:35.919 --> 32:37.645
[speaking foreign language]

32:37.645 --> 32:39.923
- He sat down, he drank it.

32:39.923 --> 32:42.512
[speaking foreign language]

32:42.512 --> 32:46.619
- Yet, somehow, he's the one
who's ended up poisoning you.

32:47.862 --> 32:50.830
And with the most lethal
substance known to man.

32:50.830 --> 32:54.834
[speaking foreign language]

32:54.834 --> 32:57.147
- [Tarpey] A substance
only available in Russia.

32:57.147 --> 33:01.048
[speaking foreign language]

33:01.048 --> 33:02.981
- Where he hadn't
been for six years.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.948
[speaking foreign language]

33:04.948 --> 33:06.639
- I mean, I could think of more

33:09.539 --> 33:11.437
forgettable encounters.

33:11.437 --> 33:15.200
[speaking foreign language]

34:06.182 --> 34:09.599
- [Olly] He maintains
it came from Sasha.

34:09.599 --> 34:12.153
That Sasha requested
the meeting,

34:12.153 --> 34:14.983
that polonium does
nothing to him.

34:16.813 --> 34:17.986
[speaking foreign language]

34:17.986 --> 34:19.195
- [Olly] Next question.

34:20.886 --> 34:22.163
- You could ask him
why it's taken a month

34:22.163 --> 34:23.578
for polonium to take effect.

34:41.907 --> 34:43.564
- Here's a question,

34:45.117 --> 34:46.394
why, if he's gonna be like this,

34:46.394 --> 34:48.707
did he ask to meet with
us in the first place?

34:50.053 --> 34:52.366
- I came here because
I wanted to wish you

34:52.366 --> 34:54.022
good luck with your inquiry.

34:59.580 --> 35:03.618
Trust me, Brian, you're
going to need it.

35:10.798 --> 35:13.214
- [Tarpey] That's one
lie after another.

35:13.214 --> 35:14.836
- He didn't deny buying the tea.

35:14.836 --> 35:16.355
That's another thing.

35:16.355 --> 35:18.357
I mean, you know, he pretty
much denied everything else.

35:18.357 --> 35:19.841
- And he also got a time wrong.

35:19.841 --> 35:21.464
He said they got back
to the hotel at four.

35:21.464 --> 35:22.637
- [Jim] When it
was off past three.

35:22.637 --> 35:23.914
- And those were the 30 minutes

35:23.914 --> 35:25.330
they used to get
the polonium ready.

35:25.330 --> 35:27.332
- Yep, old Lugovoy's
really put his foot in it.

35:27.332 --> 35:28.850
- Privalova's got the tapes.

35:30.231 --> 35:33.269
They've also done transcripts,
you can have those today.

35:33.269 --> 35:34.684
- The catch being...

35:34.684 --> 35:35.754
- No catch.

35:35.754 --> 35:37.238
Just one stipulation.

35:37.238 --> 35:39.309
They want you to collect
them from their officers,

35:39.309 --> 35:40.414
hand them over
officially and mark

35:40.414 --> 35:41.622
the end of the visit and so on.

35:41.622 --> 35:42.588
Which I thought
sounded reasonable.

35:42.588 --> 35:45.143
So, if we're open to that chaps,

35:45.143 --> 35:47.386
you could be on a plane
home early evening.

35:51.632 --> 35:54.359
[dramatic music]

36:26.045 --> 36:29.601
[speaking foreign language]

36:29.601 --> 36:31.189
- Just keep moving.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.299
[speaking foreign language]

36:38.299 --> 36:42.372
- You ever get the feeling
you're being followed?

36:52.900 --> 36:55.316
- On behalf of the
Prosecutor General

36:55.316 --> 36:56.835
of the Russian Federation,

36:59.562 --> 37:01.495
tapes of your conversation,

37:09.261 --> 37:11.919
transcripts from
your conversation.

37:15.750 --> 37:20.203
Is there anything more we can
do to assist your inquiry?

37:22.067 --> 37:22.861
- No.

37:33.354 --> 37:34.252
- Thank you gents.

37:36.806 --> 37:38.256
- Look.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.982
The photographers, every
last one of them have gone.

37:42.329 --> 37:44.572
- They wanted it all on record

37:44.572 --> 37:46.056
how helpful they've all been.

37:47.713 --> 37:50.544
[dramatic music]

37:55.134 --> 37:56.377
- What's goodbye again?

37:57.413 --> 37:59.173
[speaking foreign language]

37:59.173 --> 38:00.485
- Yeah

38:00.485 --> 38:05.490
that.

38:29.030 --> 38:30.722
- [Tippon] Well,
welcome back fellas.

38:30.722 --> 38:33.207
- So who do you want
first, Kovtun or Lugovoy?

38:33.207 --> 38:35.140
- Well, according to you,
Kovtun wasn't even Kovtun.

38:35.140 --> 38:36.866
So let's have Lugovoy.

38:36.866 --> 38:38.316
- Yeah.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.972
Claimed he'd been poisoned
then strolls in there

38:39.972 --> 38:42.527
like he'd just been watching
the Monaco grand prix.

38:46.634 --> 38:47.463
- Okay.

38:51.639 --> 38:52.640
- Press play.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.124
- It's playing.
- Oh.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.299
[silence]

39:00.027 --> 39:02.650
[chuckling]

39:02.650 --> 39:05.343
- There's always a bit of
blank, start of the tape.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.551
- [Tippon] Oh is there?

39:06.551 --> 39:08.069
- Usually yeah, before it...

39:08.069 --> 39:09.139
- Right.
- You know?

39:22.912 --> 39:23.844
- How much blank we talking?

39:23.844 --> 39:25.570
- Try forwarding it a bit.

39:30.885 --> 39:33.060
[silence]

39:55.358 --> 39:56.186
It's...

40:00.328 --> 40:01.157
Excuse me.

40:11.719 --> 40:13.549
- At least we have
the transcript.

40:13.549 --> 40:14.826
- Yeah, it means nothing.

40:16.759 --> 40:19.071
You could have written
it for all anyone knows.

40:27.252 --> 40:30.669
Listen, you did what I asked.

40:31.912 --> 40:34.742
You went there, you
got the interviews,

40:34.742 --> 40:37.055
you got the tapes
like I asked you.

40:38.366 --> 40:39.609
And think of it this way,

40:39.609 --> 40:42.647
that blank tape
proves they're guilty.

40:42.647 --> 40:44.234
Proves we're on the right track.

40:45.615 --> 40:47.168
Otherwise why would they do it?

40:48.929 --> 40:50.620
- Yeah.
- Now you go home.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.104
Get yourself some rest mate.

40:52.104 --> 40:52.864
Alight?

40:54.521 --> 40:56.730
[dramatic music]
- Yeah.

40:56.730 --> 40:57.524
Thanks.

42:16.257 --> 42:19.088
[thunder rolling]

42:22.609 --> 42:25.301
[bells tolling]

43:12.072 --> 43:13.832
- You went to Moscow.

43:14.764 --> 43:15.696
- We went.

43:15.696 --> 43:18.181
It was a productive trip.

43:19.838 --> 43:22.116
We all now agree
who's responsible.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.122
I wish I had better news.

43:33.231 --> 43:34.404
- Do you know this man?

43:35.613 --> 43:37.235
Boris Berezovsky.

43:37.235 --> 43:40.272
He turned his back on Russia.

43:42.136 --> 43:43.137
He helped Sasha.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.692
He help Anatoly and me.

43:47.935 --> 43:49.212
Today he tell me,

43:50.317 --> 43:54.839
"Marina, they
murder your husband.

43:56.047 --> 44:00.430
They call you, they
try to frighten you.

44:00.430 --> 44:01.569
They go back to Russia.

44:02.570 --> 44:03.813
They're never coming back.

44:05.401 --> 44:08.335
To get justice, it
is almost impossible.

44:11.269 --> 44:16.101
Maybe it's time to
join your country.

44:18.828 --> 44:23.350
Sasha give you and your
wife a better life.

44:23.350 --> 44:26.422
Go forward and
enjoy, for Sasha."

44:26.422 --> 44:30.046
[dramatic music]

44:30.046 --> 44:32.670
- And what did you say to that?

44:38.296 --> 44:39.884
- I think about it.

44:41.057 --> 44:41.886
Of course.

44:45.821 --> 44:47.167
I think about it

44:49.687 --> 44:51.136
and then I say, "No,

44:54.795 --> 44:55.934
we keep fighting.

44:59.558 --> 45:03.493
There is chance,
even tiny chance.

45:05.944 --> 45:07.808
This is what we do for Sasha."

45:32.212 --> 45:35.042
[machine beeping]

45:48.055 --> 45:50.817
[dramatic music]

46:18.776 --> 46:21.468
[gentle music]
