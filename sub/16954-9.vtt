08:42.154 --> 08:43.756
{\an3}She's always doing something,
and I'm thinking,

08:43.823 --> 08:44.690
"Why aren't you
going to aftercare?"

08:44.757 --> 08:46.626
- Right.
- I just see things

08:46.692 --> 08:48.194
slipping back
into the same routine,

08:48.261 --> 08:51.898
and I'm--and I don't
know how to approach her.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.132
- Perfect. Thank you so much.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.934
This is on--thanks.
- Awesome. Thanks.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.003
I guess my whole thing is I
don't see her

08:57.069 --> 08:58.671
trying to help herself.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.940
- Right.
- I don't see it.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.143
{\an3}It's kind of irritating to me,
to be honest with you.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.045
- You're telling me, Mom.
- Oh, I know. I'm just saying

09:06.112 --> 09:08.247
{\an3}because--only because
you're trying to do

09:08.314 --> 09:11.050
all these things for her,

09:11.117 --> 09:14.053
{\an3}and I feel like she's not
trying to do it for herself.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.989
{\an3}Like--I'm kind of like you.
Like, I just want to just go--

09:17.056 --> 09:19.558
- "What the [bleep]?"
- Yeah. "Come on.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.560
Do something, something."

09:21.627 --> 09:23.963
{\an3}As time goes on, I get, like,
pissed off, because I think

09:24.030 --> 09:26.933
that she's not trying to do
anything to better herself.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.901
- I feel like people
don't understand,

09:28.968 --> 09:32.071
and I don't think--even
think Cate understands

09:32.138 --> 09:34.707
how damaged she really is...

09:34.774 --> 09:36.008
- Yeah.
- How abused, and how that

09:36.075 --> 09:37.877
damage is just really,

09:37.944 --> 09:40.279
{\an1}really, like,
life-affecting and just--

09:40.346 --> 09:43.182
- What is it gonna take?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.751
- Therapy.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.720
{\an1}- And Cate does know
how important it is to you.

09:47.787 --> 09:48.721
You might get to the point
where you might say,

09:48.788 --> 09:49.755
"Listen," and talk about it.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.692
- Yeah,
I guess so.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.087
{\an3}Okay. So Michael,
the only job position

that you can really have
is being Coba the Boba.

{\an3}I will probably give you

11:04.363 --> 11:07.833
I don't think it's too healthy
for our personal relationship.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.435
- Okay. Well, what if I don't
have anyone for the mascot?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.903
- I'll do it.
- Should I just hire a talent?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.271
- I'll--no, no. I'll do it.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.672

other stuff

11:13.739 --> 11:15.674
as you get things going.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.043
{\an3}- Tomorrow morning, the health
inspector's gonna be here,

11:17.109 --> 11:18.778
meeting with people.
- Job interviews.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.246
- People--
- About time.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.181
- So tonight, we're cleaning
and organizing things.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.350
7:00 a.m., I'll be here. Okay?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.052
- So the only other thing I'd
like to bring to your attention

11:26.118 --> 11:27.253
is the big, three-door
freezer--I mean fridge.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.888
- Okay. What? Yes.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.057
{\an1}- We need to get
the temperature up to about 42

11:31.123 --> 11:33.993
{\an1}so the thing can be thawing,
because it was at 35 back there,

11:34.060 --> 11:35.361
{\an1}and you need it
a little bit warmer.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.695
{\an3}- You don't put it
in the freezer.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.064
You put it in the refrigerator.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.865
{\an1}- That's what I said.
The refrigerator.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.367
- Oh, my God.
- The refrigerator.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.369
- Well, the refrigerator should
be at the regular temperature.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.337
Is anyone checking it?

11:45.404 --> 11:46.939
- This is 40.
- Yeah.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.240
- This one I could not get
to move.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.242
- Okay.
You don't put the stuff in there

11:50.309 --> 11:52.011
when it should be over there.
Where is the stuff at?

11:52.078 --> 11:53.779
- Michael put the stuff in here,
okay?

11:53.846 --> 11:55.281
- All right. Michael?
- What?

11:55.347 --> 11:58.317
- We need all of
this stuff de-thawed.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.287
First of all, why is the freezer
warmer than the refrigerator?

12:01.353 --> 12:03.022
{\an1}- You ask her.
I didn't touch those.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.357
- I set--
- This is a refrigerator.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.760
- I'm telling you, this--
- Put it up.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.929
{\an3}- I don't know how to get
this one to work.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.298
- Okay. Excuse me.
Set to--there we go.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.801
- I got this one--
I got this one up,

12:15.868 --> 12:17.203
but I couldn't work that one,

12:17.269 --> 12:19.338
{\an1}and he told me that these are
all refrigerators.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.340
{\an1}The only freezer
we have is this one.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.375
It says "freezer" on it.

12:23.442 --> 12:26.512
- So that is a refrigerator,
then. Then put this in there.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.347
- I will put it--
- What's so difficult?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.949
- I'm just saying that you need
to figure out how to set that.

12:30.015 --> 12:31.884
- We didn't know.
We didn't know.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.819
This is a fridge.
- I am setting it. All right?

12:33.886 --> 12:35.254
So great.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.456
{\an3}- So do you need this stuff
moved out of here?

12:37.523 --> 12:38.524
- Yeah. Just move it over there.
- Yes, because it's too cold.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.826
{\an3}- Okay, Mom.
Now that--thank you.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.095
{\an3}You can stare at a door when
there's many other things to do.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.363
{\an1}- You asked me to be here.
Get off my ass.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.198
- If everyone--
- Get off my ass.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.900

16:21.814 --> 16:24.483
{\an1}You drink that instead

to do for dinner tonight?

16:50.109 --> 16:51.377

16:51.443 --> 16:55.180
- Well, I can only have
three ounces of a meat.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.548
So I'm thinking chicken.

16:56.615 --> 16:59.251
- How are the bars?
- The bars are good,

16:59.318 --> 17:01.520

of it's kind of chalky.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.355

17:14.299 --> 17:16.300
- Bleh.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.536
It's really good.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.739
- Ooh, chalky.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.641

about myself

17:22.708 --> 17:24.576

17:24.643 --> 17:26.578
{\an1}That's probably another reason

It's a little worrying. Yeah.

I was getting resentment,

I'd hear her walk upstairs,

28:32.043 --> 28:33.778

28:33.845 --> 28:34.446

{\an3}- And you don't want it to

- Yeah. I don't want to do that.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.419
- Okay.
- But I also feel like

28:41.486 --> 28:43.755
my resentment got to a point
where I boiled over,

28:43.822 --> 28:46.724
told her she needed to do
something and figure this out,

28:46.791 --> 28:48.460
and then she went
to treatment and,

28:48.526 --> 28:50.228
you know, did all these things.
So then, I think about it.

28:50.295 --> 28:52.097
"Oh, my God. Well, she didn't
go to treatment because

28:52.163 --> 28:53.798
she wanted to go to treatment
or she felt she needed it.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.066
She went to treatment probably
because I went up there

28:55.133 --> 28:56.201
and said something
to her about it."

28:56.267 --> 28:58.169
- Okay.
- You know,

28:58.236 --> 28:59.771
"Who are you doing it for?"
- But it doesn't mean that you

28:59.838 --> 29:01.306
cannot talk to her about these
things, okay?

29:01.372 --> 29:03.208
How you say it is not,

29:03.274 --> 29:05.310
{\an3}"How come
you're not doing that?"

29:05.376 --> 29:09.114
{\an3}It's more of, "You know,
it's really making me wonder

29:09.180 --> 29:11.249
"about my relationship
with you,

29:11.316 --> 29:13.952
{\an3}"you know, that you're not
following through with this.

29:14.018 --> 29:16.788

29:20.592 --> 29:23.761
But I also love myself
unconditionally."

29:23.828 --> 29:27.031
{\an3}So if it's starting to interfere
in your relationship with her,

29:27.098 --> 29:28.299
{\an3}I don't think there's
anything wrong with you saying,

29:28.366 --> 29:29.801
"I'm scared you're gonna go back

29:29.868 --> 29:31.503
to the person
that you were before."

29:31.569 --> 29:33.972

what I'm saying and say,

29:34.038 --> 29:35.540
"Oh, my God.
If I don't do this, X, Y,

29:35.607 --> 29:37.775
and Z, he's not gonna be happy,
and he might leave me."

29:37.842 --> 29:39.344
{\an3}- That's how you think she's
gonna, like,

29:39.410 --> 29:41.045
interpret it, right?
- I feel like she's gonna

29:41.112 --> 29:41.913
internalize it that way,
like, "Oh, my God. Well--"

29:41.980 --> 29:42.881
{\an3}- Will she tell you
if she does it?

29:42.947 --> 29:45.150
- No, no. She won't.
She won't tell me.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.317
{\an3}- See, that's the part that's
hard, because her recovery

29:46.384 --> 29:47.952

it's important for her

29:52.423 --> 29:54.259
to find her own self.

29:54.325 --> 29:55.860
Maybe I need to make
