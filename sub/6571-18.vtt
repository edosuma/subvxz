<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.019 --> 00:23.422
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth was working</i>
<i>at home when he noticed something unusual.</i>

00:23.523 --> 00:25.491
<i>[Rattling]</i>

00:27.627 --> 00:29.527
That can't be good.

00:29.629 --> 00:33.030
Okay, I checked underneath,
and there is a problem.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.601
- You know this isn't a real house?
- It's a model house.

00:35.702 --> 00:39.103
Well, the drain pipes aren't hooked up.
Just empty under the house.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.402
- <i>Plus, there's a lot ofblue paint down there.</i>
- And some pieces of denim?

00:42.509 --> 00:44.409
- Yeah.
- We've got a guy like that here.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.706
<i>Well, that's why</i>
<i>your living room is sinking.</i>

00:46.813 --> 00:49.543
And I think the city's
gonna have to red-tag it.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.412
The city is sending out an inspector.

00:51.518 --> 00:54.316
They're gonna be crawling over every inch
of this place. You're going to need to leave.

00:54.421 --> 00:57.720
Where the hell do you want me to go?
Back to your mother's?

00:57.824 --> 01:01.260
I believe there's a freeloading loser
in my bed.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.386
Buster just lost a hand.
He's going through a lot.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.396
I'm talking about Oscar.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.126
Oh, yes. Your brother.
I can see why that would bug you.

01:08.234 --> 01:13.001
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Oscar had stayed with</i>
<i>Lucille primarily to reconnect with Buster...</i>

01:13.106 --> 01:16.974
- <i>whom he secretly believed to be his natural son.</i>
- Hey, Uncle.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.806
I feel so responsible for that.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.245
<i>Oscar had gotten injured on a shoddy device</i>
<i>George Sr. Had invented...</i>

01:22.348 --> 01:26.079
- <i>when he forgot Buster</i>
<i>was wearing a prosthetic hand.</i>
- Buster! The Cornballer!

01:26.186 --> 01:28.586
- [Both Screaming]
- <i>[Sizzling]</i>

01:28.688 --> 01:30.952
- It's my father's fault!
- My fault?

01:31.057 --> 01:34.220
I was trying to keep you
from burning yourself, you idiot!

01:34.327 --> 01:37.763
I mean, yes, yes.
George Sr. Sure rushed this to market.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.458
<i>The only reason she likes him</i>
<i>is he has hair.</i>

01:40.567 --> 01:43.900
And the only reason he has any
is because he's never had any stress.

01:44.003 --> 01:47.370
Yeah? Well, you could save me
a lot of stress if you just turned yourself in.

01:47.474 --> 01:51.672
No, never. I can't go back to the joint.
No, I cannot go back there.

01:55.081 --> 01:59.279
- Hey, man!

01:59.385 --> 02:01.785
Yeah!

02:04.557 --> 02:07.822
- It's a hell-hole.
- I finally got the court to try you in absentia.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.395
Which means we're not supposed to
have any idea where you are.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.955
So you don't have to go to prison,
but you can't stay here.

02:14.067 --> 02:18.401
Remember that French movie we tried to
sneak into once- <i>Dangerous Cousins?</i>

02:18.505 --> 02:20.700
No, l-Why? Did we-

02:20.807 --> 02:24.243
[Stammering]
I don't remember that, no.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.403
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>George Michael remembered very well.</i>

02:26.513 --> 02:31.212
<i>In fact, he currently had a copy of the DVD</i>
<i>hidden in his sock drawer.</i>

02:31.317 --> 02:33.046
Kind of.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.212
Why do you ask?

02:35.321 --> 02:38.984
I got passes to the premiere of the American
remake. Supposed to be great.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.185
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>It wasn't great, and Maeby knew it.</i>

02:41.294 --> 02:46.197
<i>The studio at which she'd finagled a job</i>
<i>had hoped to avoid controversy...</i>

02:46.299 --> 02:49.928
<i>by artlessly explaining that the two leads</i>
<i>weren't biological cousins.</i>

02:50.036 --> 02:52.231
<i>[Woman On Film]</i>
<i>Shut up and kiss me!</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:55.608
- Where is everybody?
- They've been fired.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.609
And you gotta fix this,
or you're gonna be fired too.

02:58.711 --> 03:02.078
- Cut it down if you have to.
- But it's only 71 minutes long.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.174
And it's only, like, 63 minutes long.
So bring Ann.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.480
No, that's not her kind of thing.

03:07.587 --> 03:11.887
I mean, if it maintains any of the complex
eroticism of the French original anyway.

03:11.991 --> 03:14.585
I like the way they think.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.162
<i>[Narrator] And later, at the office,</i>
<i>Michael had another surprise.</i>

03:17.263 --> 03:19.163
This can't be good.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.291
"Michael, it saddens me
greatly to say to you...

03:22.402 --> 03:25.394
"that I can no longer work
at the Bluth Company.

03:25.505 --> 03:28.372
- You've been a great boss"-
- I'm sorry, Tobias. Do you work here?

03:28.474 --> 03:32.774
Do I work- I developed an eating disorder
being your assistant, Michael.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.870
I never saw you at the desk.

03:34.981 --> 03:37.916
Well, excuse me if I was too busy
on my knees in front of the toilet, Michael.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.452
"I have a tremendous opportunity...

03:41.554 --> 03:43.454
"now that the Blue Man Group
has dropped their cease-and-desist...

03:43.556 --> 03:45.490
"and invited me to audition in Las Vegas.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.423
Also, I've developed
some issues with food"-

03:47.527 --> 03:50.963
I'm sorry to interrupt one more time.
Is this the real Blue Man Group this time?

03:51.064 --> 03:54.795
<i>[Narrator] Tobias had recently been asked</i>
<i>to address a group of depressed men...</i>

03:54.901 --> 03:57.563
<i>who had been described</i>
<i>over the phone as blue.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:06.401
I feel like a- [Bleeps] idiot.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.948
<i>Fortunately, I found a wonderful circle</i>
<i>of men to get me through that.</i>

04:10.049 --> 04:14.247
Oh, before I forget, your old secretary,
Kitty Sanchez, called...

04:14.354 --> 04:15.844
and wanted to meet with you.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.083
- I penciled her in for 4:00 today.
- Why didn't you tell me?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.921
Oh, this is my fault too?

04:21.027 --> 04:24.258
Everything- No. No!
I will not let this make me eat!

04:24.364 --> 04:26.332
[Sobbing]

04:26.432 --> 04:29.367
<i>So get this. Tomorrow I gotta go on record</i>
<i>and say I don't know where Dad is.</i>

04:29.469 --> 04:32.495
And now Kitty Sanchez
wants to meet with me.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.039
<i>[Narrator] And meetings with Kitty</i>
<i>had never ended well.</i>

04:35.141 --> 04:37.803
- Say good-bye to these.
- Spring break! Whoo!

04:37.910 --> 04:40.208
- Perhaps this'll jog your memory.
<i>- [Cal] Oh! They're crooked!</i>

04:40.313 --> 04:42.838
Plus, Dad will not leave the attic,
which means he's gonna get caught...

04:42.949 --> 04:44.849
which means I'm gonna
get caught for hiding him.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.681
Well, why don't you get Gob
to do your dirty work for you?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.688
<i>Shall I knock Dad out</i>
<i>and chain him to a pipe somewhere?</i>

04:50.790 --> 04:53.224
Or should I risk another
herpes outbreak with Kitty?

04:53.326 --> 04:56.454
- Which is it this time?
- <i>Definitely not one of those two things.</i>

04:56.562 --> 04:58.462
But are you upset about something, Gob?

04:58.564 --> 05:02.523
<i>I made you a thank-you gift last week</i>
<i>about which you haven't said word one.</i>

05:02.635 --> 05:06.196
Come on.
You asked me for $5,000...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.831
so that you could invest
in a Franklin CD.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.967
Now, I assumed that you were
talking about the mutual fund...

05:12.078 --> 05:14.239
and not a compact disc
of you singing to your hand.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.407
<i>[Narrator] Gob had recently made</i>
<i>a recording ofhis ventriloquism act.</i>

05:17.517 --> 05:19.747
"Franklin Comes Alive." Take one.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.514
<i>He hoped it would break down racial</i>
<i>barriers and maybe be a crossover hit.</i>

05:22.622 --> 05:25.648
It ain't easy bein' white

05:25.758 --> 05:28.693
It ain't easy bein' brown

05:28.795 --> 05:32.231
<i>All this pressure to be bright</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:35.893
I got childrens all over town

05:36.002 --> 05:39.165
Sometimes-
Hey, where'd the guy go?

05:39.272 --> 05:42.503
I tried to express something to you
in a couple of those numbers...

05:42.608 --> 05:45.338
and maybe, just maybe,
heal this country a little bit.

05:45.445 --> 05:48.073
<i>But you, you didn't even</i>
<i>bother to listen to it.</i>

05:48.181 --> 05:52.675
I did listen to it.
L-l-l-I am listening to it. Gob. Hey.

05:52.785 --> 05:56.346
Maybe the reason I didn't say anything
is 'cause I didn't want to embarrass you.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.549
It's my favorite, favorite record.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.751
Well, then you-
you- [Bleeps] up.

06:01.894 --> 06:04.419
[Sobbing]
Because I am so embarrassed.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.226
It's a good CD.
It's a really good CD.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.530
- I can't believe that you love it.
- I love it so much.

06:10.636 --> 06:14.299
Oh, God. Oh, God, look at us.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.773
Crying like a couple of girls.

06:16.876 --> 06:21.245
Aw, you're the only one crying.
But I love the music.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.372
- <i>And the card with your face on it?</i>
- And the healing.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.383
Home run!

06:27.653 --> 06:30.087
We'll do your dirty work
for you, Mikey.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.825
- You leave the rough stuff to Franklin and me.
- Now I gotta listen to that CD.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.623
- <i>Hi, Dad.</i>
- Right.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.221
You remember Franklin.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.893
- Hey, Franklin.
<i>- My man!</i>

06:43.002 --> 06:45.994
- How 'bout some tongue?
- Wha- Oh-

06:46.105 --> 06:48.733
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>But Franklin didn't want to kiss at all.</i>

06:48.841 --> 06:51.275
<i>Gob had soaked</i>
<i>the puppet's mouth in ether.</i>

06:51.377 --> 06:55.609
- <i>And downstairs, Tobias shared</i>
<i>his good news with Lindsay.</i>
- [Water Running]

06:55.715 --> 06:57.979
"...once in a lifetime."

06:58.084 --> 07:00.985
Tobias, I am not uprooting my life
and moving to Vegas.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.352
Maybe this is a sign that our relationship
isn't working, and we should split again.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.984
<i>Wait a second. I thought we</i> were <i>split up,</i>
<i>and this would bring us back together.</i>

07:08.094 --> 07:11.552
Well, maybe the fact that we don't know
if we're together or not...

07:11.664 --> 07:14.030
is a sign that we should split again.

07:14.133 --> 07:16.124
<i>Or stay split up.</i>

07:16.235 --> 07:19.534
Okay, forget about Vegas.
We'll stay here and get back together.

07:19.639 --> 07:24.633
- Or stay together and either
rekindle or fan this fire.
- [House Creaking]

07:24.744 --> 07:29.010
<i>[Narrator] And soon, Gob was on his way to</i>
<i>dump his father on the police station steps.</i>

07:29.115 --> 07:30.742
Do you forgive me?

07:30.850 --> 07:34.616
<i>And he decided to let himself off the hook</i>
<i>using his ventriloquist skills.</i>

07:34.720 --> 07:38.315
[Imitating George Sr.] I cherish you, Gob.
Come here and give me a kiss.

07:38.424 --> 07:41.621
I'm driving, Dad.
[As George Sr.] Now!

07:41.727 --> 07:44.161
- <i>[Narrator] It was weird.</i>
- [Kiss]

07:44.263 --> 07:49.200
<i>And that's when Gob noticed the CD</i>
<i>and card that he'd made for Michael.</i>

07:49.302 --> 07:52.635
It's not even open. Michael!

07:52.738 --> 07:57.471
<i>Meanwhile, Michael's meeting with Kitty</i>
<i>wasn't as distressing as he'd thought.</i>

07:57.577 --> 08:02.014
The program has changed my life. And I have
a sponsor now. [Whispers] He's famous.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.173
- That's great.
- <i>I can't tell you who he is.</i>

08:04.283 --> 08:08.413
But let's just say that
he was on <i>Night Court.</i>

08:08.521 --> 08:10.648
- Well, you look great.
- I can tell you who it's not.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.656
<i>It's not Bull.</i>
<i>It's not Harry Anderson.</i>

08:12.758 --> 08:13.850
- I got it.
- He's white.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.258
I know who it is.

08:16.362 --> 08:20.423
What happens is, when I don't have
a man in my life, I tend to go a little crazy.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.330
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>But I'm keeping it together now.</i>

08:22.435 --> 08:27.532
And I wanted to tell you I'm not gonna
try to hurt you guys anymore.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.905
- Don't suppose I can get that in writing.
- You did try to blow me up.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.604
- Sorry about that.
- Just don't piss me off again.

08:33.712 --> 08:36.682
- [Cackles]
- [Chuckling]

08:36.782 --> 08:38.443
You all right?

08:38.551 --> 08:41.918
"Oftentimes the heart acts
without consulting the head, and thusly"-

08:42.020 --> 08:45.684
Oh, I see you wasted no time
in filling my seat hole.

08:45.791 --> 08:50.421
Oh, no, no. I just came by so that you
could say good-bye to these.

08:50.530 --> 08:54.830
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- It's the last time you're going to be seeing these.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.129
<i>How ironic.</i>
<i>I just found out I'm staying.</i>

08:57.236 --> 09:00.433
- Will you take these back?
- Okay, let's just all put our tops down.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.030
Just put 'em on down.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.109
You're not goin' to Vegas?

09:04.210 --> 09:07.111
Sadly, my wife said no to my dream.

09:07.213 --> 09:11.877
So I shall continue
to toil through this waking life.

09:11.984 --> 09:16.011
Wow, you are so real.
Why can't I meet someone like you?

09:16.122 --> 09:19.683
<i>[Narrator] And Michael decided that he</i>
<i>better keep Kitty occupied with a man.</i>

09:19.792 --> 09:21.692
<i>At least until after his meeting.</i>

09:21.794 --> 09:26.322
Hey, gang, I got an idea. Tobias, why don't
you take Kitty out for the afternoon?

09:26.432 --> 09:28.332
- [Stammering]
- Huh?

09:28.434 --> 09:31.460
Are you trying to set up your former
assistant with your current assistant?

09:31.571 --> 09:35.473
What a great idea for a
Hugh Grant-Julia Roberts type movie.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.069
I recently heard that the actor, John Larroquette,
was looking for a meaty character piece.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.976
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And so, free of obstacles...</i>

09:42.081 --> 09:44.777
<i>Michael prepared</i>
<i>to sign the affidavit...</i>

09:44.884 --> 09:47.614
<i>maintaining he had no idea</i>
<i>where his father was.</i>

09:47.720 --> 09:50.450
You have not been in contact with him.

Officers!

10:06.906 --> 10:09.204
Michael, these men are here-
just a little bit early-

10:09.308 --> 10:10.707
because we have
photographic evidence...

10:10.810 --> 10:12.835
which discredits
the affidavit you just signed.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.709
Are those balls? 'Cause the last time
we were here, they were balls.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.113
These are not balls. This was taken
with a traffic camera.

10:18.217 --> 10:23.780
<i>It shows you in your car with your father</i>
<i>within the last 24 hours.</i>

10:25.625 --> 10:27.957
I wish they were balls.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.159
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael was in police custody...</i>

10:34.266 --> 10:37.360
<i>after a photo ofhim helping</i>
<i>his father escape had turned up.</i>

10:37.470 --> 10:39.529
Did you see that picture?
That's you, right?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.800
Were you holdin' up
a photo of me or somethin'?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.966
Of course you don't recognize it.

10:44.076 --> 10:48.069
- It's the card from the CD you didn't even open.
- <i>You found that, did you?</i>

10:48.180 --> 10:50.842
Right between the gearbox
and the "pull back from aircraft" lever.

10:50.950 --> 10:53.817
So this is how you repay me
for how I repay you?

10:53.919 --> 10:55.944
I actually did not get
a chance to listen to it yet.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.353
Probably should've told you,
but I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

10:58.457 --> 11:00.254
Oh, you're so sensitive.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.157
Just like when you whipped up those tears
talking about how much you loved it.

11:03.262 --> 11:07.494
I will listen to it, I promise. But I'm
in a lot of trouble here. Where is Dad?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.500
I've got him stashed away
somewhere safe now.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.332
- Get him, quickly,
otherwise I'm gonna be stuck in here.
- Good!

11:12.438 --> 11:14.235
- I hope you rot in here!
- What-

11:14.340 --> 11:16.740
And guess what else?
Dad kissed me.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.174
How? He looked pretty unconscious
in that picture.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.044
I didn't say he was totally into it.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.749
<i>[Narrator] And George Michael</i>
<i>tried to break up with Ann.</i>

11:27.853 --> 11:31.084
I can't go out tomorrow night,
'cause there's this movie premiere at-

11:31.190 --> 11:32.987
It's kinda racy, but-

11:33.092 --> 11:36.528
Oh, the cousin one? I can't believe it.
I was just gonna ask you to go.

11:36.629 --> 11:40.395
- You want to see that?
- No, I want to get
the whole church group together.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.399
We're gonna picket those bastards.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.561
<i>[Narrator] George Michael</i>
<i>had only heard Ann swear once before...</i>

11:45.671 --> 11:50.267
<i>when hejoined some ofher youth group</i>
<i>to protest the home of Marc Cherry...</i>

11:50.376 --> 11:52.708
<i>executive producer</i>
<i>of the hit show</i> Desperate Housewives.

11:52.812 --> 11:56.976
- It's a satire!
<i>- There's nothing funny about fornication!</i>

11:57.083 --> 11:58.983
The bastard saw us!

11:59.085 --> 12:03.078
<i>[Narrator] And the promise of another kiss</i>
<i>was too enticing to turn down.</i>

12:03.189 --> 12:05.350
<i>Well, yes. The bastards.</i>

12:05.458 --> 12:09.053
<i>Oscar, meanwhile,</i>
<i>checked in on Buster.</i>

12:09.161 --> 12:12.130
[Gasps]
Buster! Buster! Be careful!

12:12.231 --> 12:15.325
- It's not a real hand, remember?
- I'm so forgetful.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.629
- I hope you don't get that from me.
- <i>Get that from you?</i>

12:17.737 --> 12:19.398
Do you feel okay?

12:19.505 --> 12:22.497
- [Sizzling]
- [Screams] Just forget it!

12:22.608 --> 12:26.942
I wanted to share my Pop Secret with you.
Oh, but forget it!

12:27.046 --> 12:28.843
Pop secret?

12:30.116 --> 12:33.916
Pop se- Is Oscar my real father?

12:34.019 --> 12:37.011
<i>[Narrator] Lucille, meanwhile,</i>
<i>was on the phone with Michael.</i>

12:37.123 --> 12:40.684
They're keeping me overnight.
Could you tell my son I'm on a business trip?

12:40.793 --> 12:43.261
- Why can't the girl at work do it?
- Tobias?

12:43.362 --> 12:46.092
I sent him on a date with Kitty
to keep her off our backs.

12:46.198 --> 12:49.133
You better hope Lindsay doesn't find out.
She'll be devastated.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.102
- Find out what?
- Your husband's dating Kitty the whore.

12:52.204 --> 12:55.765
<i>He is? That's</i>- <i>That's horrible.</i>

12:55.875 --> 12:57.843
Do I know my daughter?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.934
She only wants what she can't have.

13:00.045 --> 13:01.444
Since you're devastating people...

13:01.547 --> 13:03.913
tell Gob I'll be telling the cops
it was him in the truck...

13:04.016 --> 13:05.916
so he'll be joining me here.

13:06.018 --> 13:08.509
I've got a nice, hard cot
with his name on it.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.455
- You'd do that to your own brother?
- I said "cot."

13:12.558 --> 13:14.788
Where's Mother?

13:14.894 --> 13:19.092
You lied to me. You said my father
was my father, but my uncle is my father.

13:19.198 --> 13:22.656
My father is my uncle!

13:22.768 --> 13:27.296
<i>[Narrator] At that moment, the guards</i>
<i>played a CD they'd recently confiscated.</i>

13:27.406 --> 13:30.705
[Gob] Now I got a special thank you
to the brother who made this happen.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.607
Is that Franklin?

13:47.026 --> 13:50.518
<i>- Michael realized that</i>
<i>he could never turn his brother in.</i>
<i>- [Gob] Michael!</i>

13:50.629 --> 13:53.530
- <i>Gob, meanwhile, was having a similar epiphany.</i>

14:02.474 --> 14:06.376
Barry, it's Gob.
Tell Michael not to testify.

14:06.478 --> 14:09.174
I'm bringing in Dad.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.351
Franklin.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.683
[British Accent]
You've ruined the act, Gob.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.917
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Lucille confronted Oscar.</i>

14:20.025 --> 14:23.722
- You told him you were his father?
- I did no such thing!

14:23.829 --> 14:25.421
- You're high!
- You're drunk!

14:25.531 --> 14:27.965
Not this time.
I've had enough of you.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.695
So say good-bye to these,
because it's the last time-

14:32.872 --> 14:35.204
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Ann in a protest at the theater.</i>

14:35.307 --> 14:38.037
George Michael?
Are you protesting this?

14:38.143 --> 14:41.078
- This isn't the line?
- Yes, he is protesting this.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.114
He even helped me make the signs.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.241
Well, only mine and the one that says,
"This is a tricky, gray area."

14:46.352 --> 14:48.377
- What are you guys protesting?
- It's a disgusting movie...

14:48.487 --> 14:50.580
about cousins
who are into each other.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.316
Are there any more seats?

14:52.424 --> 14:55.791
Yeah. It's the best 52 minutes
you'll spend all day.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.090
[Ann]
Oh, no. We're making it worse.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.995
Prepare to be swallowed
into the depths of hell!

15:01.100 --> 15:04.501
- I guess that means no kiss?
- I'm not really in the mood for a kiss.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.833
This isn't Marc Cherry's house.

15:13.512 --> 15:16.310
- Where's your dad?
- I don't know. I just got here.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.747
Oh, that's right.
Mother told me he went to jail.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.115
- I'm so mad at her.
- [Creaking]

15:21.220 --> 15:23.415
- Guess who I just found out my father is?
- Jail?

15:23.522 --> 15:26.082
Oscar! He didn't mean to tell me,
but I figured it out.

15:26.191 --> 15:29.854
- No, I mean, my dad is in jail?
- I wouldn't worry about it. Barry's very good.

15:29.962 --> 15:35.093
<i>I'm going to take a long shower. I don't</i>
<i>even want to smell like Mother anymore.</i>

15:35.200 --> 15:37.191
I don't think we're supposed
to shower right now, Bus-

15:37.303 --> 15:38.964
- Tobias back yet?
- No.

15:39.071 --> 15:41.198
Oh, my God. He's really out with her.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.968
- Are you drunk?
- Not enough.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.942
I pushed him right into
someone else's skanky, bony arms.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.013
Well, let me tell you something,
George Michael.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.014
You have to grab love while you have it.
Don't let it get away.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.447
Oh, there you are.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.782
Oh, Maeby, everything's fine.
Your daddy's just out.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.617
Yeah, we're doing great.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.317
Mommy's gonna take a bath
with a bottle of wine.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.326
- I don't know if we're supposed to use-
- So get this.

16:02.428 --> 16:06.694
All the press actually made the premiere a hit.
There's lines for the next show.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.290
Thanks, buddy.

16:09.401 --> 16:13.394
- Hey, look at that.
We didn't get swallowed up into hell.
- [Chuckles]

16:16.442 --> 16:19.900
<i>[Narrator] And that's when George Michael</i>
<i>finally got close to Maeby...</i>

16:20.012 --> 16:23.038
<i>who, by the way, might not</i>
<i>be his biological cousin.</i>

16:23.148 --> 16:27.642
<i>Just then, Gob came home to retrieve</i>
<i>his father from where he'd stashed him.</i>

16:27.753 --> 16:30.551
- Dad's gonna be crushed.
- You don't have to tell him!

16:30.656 --> 16:33.318
<i>But Gob was referring</i>
<i>to his own father...</i>

16:33.425 --> 16:36.588
<i>who he had hidden under the house.</i>

16:36.695 --> 16:38.560
Uh-oh.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.330
<i>[Narrator] Gob had hidden his father</i>
<i>under a house that hadjust collapsed.</i>

16:45.437 --> 16:47.997
Children, you're small.
Crawl under there.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.507
- <i>We don't want to go under there.</i>
- He's not under there.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.509
He got away. Thank God.

16:52.611 --> 16:56.843
<i>But then Gob remembered that this meant</i>
<i>Michael would have to go to prison.</i>

16:58.150 --> 17:00.618
- We-
- l-

17:02.154 --> 17:05.180
<i>And Michael and Barry</i>
<i>made their way to the arraignment.</i>

17:05.290 --> 17:07.849
Gob is bringing your father.
Everything is going to work out fine.

17:07.960 --> 17:12.226
I wish they'd hurry up.
But I gotta tell you, I am a little torn.

17:12.330 --> 17:16.426
My father, he has created
a lot of problems for the family...

17:16.535 --> 17:20.300
and by staying in the attic he was insuring
I would go to jail with him, but-

17:22.273 --> 17:24.174
Well, maybe I'm not so torn.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.039
- Michael. Barry.
- Hey, Gob.

17:26.145 --> 17:29.308
- Where's Dad?
- Great news. Dad wasn't crushed to death.

17:29.415 --> 17:31.076
- Was there risk of that?
- <i>Yes.</i>

17:31.183 --> 17:32.741
Well, I handcuffed him
under the house.

17:32.851 --> 17:35.979
But he got free- the pipes I chained him
to weren't connected to anything.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.148
- Oh, I'm not prepared for this case.
- Are you insane?

17:39.258 --> 17:44.628
- No "thank you" for trying?
- I'm sick of you needing constant
validation for screwing up.

17:44.730 --> 17:49.224
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna tell them it was you in the stair car.

17:49.334 --> 17:52.303
Well, let me tell you
what's gonna happen.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.737
First, I'm gonna beat the crap out of you,
then I'm gonna call an ambulance.

17:55.841 --> 17:58.742
Then knowing you, I'm gonna have
to wait for some kind of an apology.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.747
- [Grunts]
- Come here!

18:05.184 --> 18:09.086
<i>[Narrator] As the boys set to once again</i>
<i>fighting in front of the courthouse</i>- 

18:09.188 --> 18:11.952
- Stop it! Stop it!
- <i>the family began to show up for the arraignment.</i>

18:12.057 --> 18:16.357
<i>I know you're in the middle of something,</i>
<i>but I'm afraid I can't work for you today.</i>

18:16.462 --> 18:18.487
I'm going to Vegas with Kitty.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.293
<i>[Narrator] But Lindsay wasn't</i>
<i>about to lose her man without a fight.</i>

18:21.400 --> 18:23.425
Over my dead body!

18:23.535 --> 18:25.765
<i>[Tobias]</i>
<i>Oh, my</i>- 

18:25.871 --> 18:30.137
Hey! Hey! I said- I said enough!

18:30.242 --> 18:32.005
Now, stop it.

18:32.111 --> 18:36.309
I am so tired of this family fighting.
The anger ends now.

18:36.415 --> 18:40.818
You're brothers, and brothers
stick together no matter what.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.854
<i>Families stick together.</i>

18:43.956 --> 18:47.687
I have torn this family apart
with my lies and my cowardice...

18:47.793 --> 18:50.523
but that comes to an end now.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.187
<i>So I'm turning myself in.</i>

18:52.297 --> 18:55.789
I don't want you to come
and visit me in prison this time.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.330
'Cause you deserve Oscar now.

19:06.945 --> 19:09.345
<i>Tobias, I actually fought for you.</i>

19:09.448 --> 19:11.348
I can't believe it.
[Chuckles]

19:11.450 --> 19:15.250
- I'm going to Vegas with Kitty.
- <i>Huh?</i>

19:22.327 --> 19:24.989
Oh, George, I've lost you again.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.531
Take back Oscar, Mother.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.533
I think I lost him too.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.661
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Oscar</i>
<i>was on his way out of town...</i>

19:32.771 --> 19:35.171
<i>when he was approached by George Sr...</i>

19:35.274 --> 19:37.242
<i>who hadjust escaped</i>
<i>from under the house.</i>

19:37.342 --> 19:41.369
I want you to turn me in so you can
get the reward, take care of the family.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.675
Why would you do that for me?

19:43.782 --> 19:45.409
Because we're brothers.

19:47.085 --> 19:51.044
<i>Later, while George Sr. Was shaving</i>
<i>his unconscious brother's head...</i>

19:51.156 --> 19:55.559
<i>he wondered whether there really was</i>
<i>a reward, and ifhe could get it.</i>

19:55.661 --> 20:00.496
<i>But there was no time, and getting even</i>
<i>with his brother was reward enough.</i>

20:03.335 --> 20:07.135
<i>So it was Oscar who was going to be</i>
<i>spending a little time alone in prison.</i>

20:07.239 --> 20:10.697
I guess Dad finally came through for us.
He actually made a sacrifice.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.970
Although who knows
what he's up to.

20:13.078 --> 20:16.878
We should just stay away from him,
let him have a little time alone in prison.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.780
He is right about one thing, though.
We're brothers. We shouldn't be fighting.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.217
- We cannot afford to lose each other.
- I can't.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.085
- I already lost a brother today.
- Franklin?

20:25.190 --> 20:27.954
Well, I didn't lose him.
But he's all puckered and white.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.893
On the plus side, you can take him
to lunch at the club now.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.396
That's the kind of joke
he would have loved.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.398
Oh, man!

20:35.500 --> 20:37.559
[Sighs]

20:39.404 --> 20:42.965
- Please don't do this.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.236
- All right.
