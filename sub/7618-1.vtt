01:29.590 --> 01:33.708
Hey, Ma, look. An airplane.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.298
- What?
- Airplane.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.614
Oh, yeah.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.304
Who was TV's Kojak?

01:43.404 --> 01:45.486
Darren McGavin.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.056
Kojak, not Kolchak.

01:51.612 --> 01:54.548
- How many letters?
- Seven.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.984
Do you have any letters already?

01:57.084 --> 02:00.120
Yeah. The third letter is a V, I think.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.589
I'm not sure.

02:01.689 --> 02:05.593
Blank-blank-blank-V-
blank-blank-blank. Right?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.528
Yes, I think.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.229
It's a bald guy, right?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.666
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as we start our descent,</i>

02:11.766 --> 02:15.736
<i>please make sure your seat backs
and tray tables are in full upright position,</i>

02:15.836 --> 02:18.970
<i>make sure your seat belt is fastened
securely and all carry-on luggage</i>

02:19.070 --> 02:23.244
<i>is stowed beneath the seat in front
of you or in the overhead bins.</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:27.247
<i>Please turn off all electronic devices
until we are safely parked at the gate.</i>

02:27.347 --> 02:29.396
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:58.445 --> 03:00.681
<i>November 12th, 1995.</i>

03:00.781 --> 03:04.318
<i>Dear Michael. Fuck you. Just fuck you.</i>

03:04.418 --> 03:07.292
<i>You just walk away?
After all you said to me?</i>

03:07.392 --> 03:10.558
<i>After all we did?
After all those fucking promises?</i>

03:10.658 --> 03:13.435
<i>After all that fucking fucking?</i>

03:30.044 --> 03:34.315
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to be
the first to welcome you to Cincinnati,</i>

03:34.415 --> 03:37.418
<i>where the local time is 7:43 p.m.,</i>

03:37.518 --> 03:40.321
<i>and the temperature
is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

03:40.421 --> 03:42.643
<i>We will be taxiing for a while,
so please...</i>

03:42.743 --> 03:47.175
<i>stay seated until the pilot turns off
the "fasten seat belt" light.</i>

03:49.563 --> 03:52.947
- Sorry I grabbed your hand.
- It's okay.

03:54.721 --> 03:56.854
It's a reflex.

03:56.954 --> 03:59.686
I'm usually sitting next to my wife.

04:01.809 --> 04:05.184
- I don't like to fly.
- I said it's okay.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.357
You can let go now, though.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.095
<i>Robert Hernandez, please pick up
the white courtesy phone.</i>

04:21.195 --> 04:24.837
<i>Please, Robert Hernandez
to the white courtesy phone, please.</i>

04:26.500 --> 04:31.310
<i>Welcome to Cincinnati/North
Kentucky International Airport.</i>

04:31.705 --> 04:35.147
<i>While on the moving sidewalk,
please stand to the...</i>

05:00.734 --> 05:03.187
- Hello.
- Hi.

05:03.287 --> 05:06.746
I need to go to The Fregoli.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.290
- Downtown.
- Yup.

05:12.506 --> 05:16.484
<i>...your attention, please.
No parking or waiting allowed.</i>

05:16.584 --> 05:18.752
<i>Unattended vehicles
in this area will be towed.</i>

05:18.852 --> 05:21.560
- Thanks.
- Yup.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.479
- Can I smoke in here?
- You see that sign?

05:59.226 --> 06:02.226
- You're from England, right?
- Yeah, I'm from England.

06:02.326 --> 06:06.633
I can tell by your accent.
And the whistling, that's British Airways.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.742
It's <i>Lakme,</i> actually.

06:10.971 --> 06:14.547
Nah, that's British Airways.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.619
Anyway, I have an ear for accents.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.526
How's the weather there now? Good?

06:28.189 --> 06:33.093
Well, I'm from there originally.
I live here now.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.809
In Sin-Sin City, you know, as I call it?

06:35.909 --> 06:37.731
Not here. The States.

06:37.831 --> 06:41.769
"The States." I like that.

06:41.869 --> 06:45.406
"Across the pond. The States. The trolley.
Cheerio. Put another shrimp on the Barbie."

06:45.506 --> 06:48.008
I like all that English stuff.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.578
- Whereabout in "The States"?
- Los Angeles.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.981
Oh, La, La. Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah. Tinseltown.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.270
Well, Cincinnati's a great city, too.
Don't knock it.

06:56.370 --> 07:00.459
- I wasn't. I'm sure it is.
- Damn straight.

07:01.137 --> 07:03.374
- First time?
- Once before.

07:03.474 --> 07:07.528
It's changed since then. You ought to
check it out, you know, while you're here.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.881
- Yeah, I will. Thanks.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

07:10.981 --> 07:13.655
Fuck you, asshole!

07:15.302 --> 07:17.571
Yeah, you oughta check it out.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.012
Check it out.

07:20.674 --> 07:24.318
The zoo is great. World-class, they say.

07:24.418 --> 07:28.782
Many, many important, you know,
whatchamacallit, endangered species,

07:28.882 --> 07:33.926
breeding programs, you know.
It's famous for it. Pandas. Other things.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.659
- Owls.
- That sounds fascinating.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.033
Damn straight.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.867
Yeah, you should check it out.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.338
And you gotta try the Cincinnati chili.
It's chili like you never had. Trust me.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.475
LA chili? England chili? Forget about it.

07:54.575 --> 07:58.378
They make it here with cinnamon and
chocolate and they serve it over pasta.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.249
- Imagine that if you can.
- I'll try to, yeah. Thanks.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.719
Is there a toy store near the hotel?

08:06.475 --> 08:09.189
A toy store? You mean, a "toy" store?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.258
Yeah, toy store.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.595
Yeah, there's a "toy" store
about two blocks up.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.514
It's open all night. Real class place.

08:17.614 --> 08:20.251
<i>I have a pickup call at 16th and Lincoln.
Anybody in the area?</i>

08:20.351 --> 08:23.319
Anyway, there's a lot to see in the city.
Revitalized downtown...

08:23.419 --> 08:25.518
- I'm only here for a day.
- What?

08:25.618 --> 08:28.063
I'm just here for a day.

08:30.411 --> 08:33.981
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm not getting that. The accent.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.918
I'm just here for a day.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.453
Well, the zoo then.

08:40.554 --> 08:44.057
You don't need more than a day
for the zoo. It's just zoo-sized.

08:44.157 --> 08:48.333
And the chili. You only need,
like, an hour for the chili.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.500
Hey, that's Michael Stone.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.304
- Michael Stone.
- Harris, can you get these bags, please?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.979
That's Michael Stone.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.943
Hello. Welcome to The Fregoli.

09:03.043 --> 09:07.012
- Hi, I'm checking in. Stone.
- Welcome, Mr. Stone.

09:07.112 --> 09:11.685
Oh, there we go. Michael Stone.
Smoking, king-sized bed.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.087
And you'll be with us
for just one night, sir?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.806
One night. Yes.

09:15.906 --> 09:18.725
I'll just need to make an imprint
of your credit card, for incidentals,

09:18.825 --> 09:22.229
- and we'll be all set.
- I'd like a quiet room, if you have one.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.937
Yes, sir. Of course.

09:39.513 --> 09:42.291
I have a charming deluxe smoking
junior suite on the tenth floor

09:42.391 --> 09:45.619
with a king-sized bed.
Far above the street noise.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.255
- That sounds good.
- Great.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.796
So it's all set then.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.959
- Dennis here will show you to your room.
- Thank you.

09:56.059 --> 09:58.083
Right this way, sir. My name is Dennis.

09:58.183 --> 10:00.053
Hi.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.422
After you, sir.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.758
- So how was your trip in?
- It was fine, thanks.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.732
Good.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.570
- Bumpy? At all?
- No.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.035
- I'm sorry?
- No.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.238
Oh, well, you're safe now.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.480
I think the room
will be to your liking, sir.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.749
Just up here to the left, sir.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.190
There you go, after you.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.994
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yeah.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.029
- What?
- Yes.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.170
Yes, the weather is very good.

11:05.432 --> 11:10.837
Very, very, very, very good.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.640
Sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.948
And here we are.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.524
After you, sir.

11:31.658 --> 11:35.529
It's the bathroom.
Air conditioning and heat controls here.

11:35.629 --> 11:40.606
TV, remote control. Mini-bar.
All self-explanatory, I think.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.106
Ice machine down the hall. And would you
like me to get you some ice before I leave?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.276
No, I'm okay, thanks. Here you go.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.779
Oh. Thank you very much, sir.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.881
If you need anything at all,
please just give us a ring.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.384
- My name's Dennis.
- Thanks.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.325
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:53.507 --> 12:56.877
<i>Touch the door to the room.
If it feels hot, do not open it.</i>

12:56.977 --> 12:58.912
<i>Fill the tub with water, soak a towel,</i>

12:59.012 --> 13:01.849
<i>and place it in the space
at the bottom of the door.</i>

13:01.949 --> 13:05.753
<i>If the door is not hot, you may leave
the room, but bring your room key with you</i>

13:05.853 --> 13:09.452
<i>in case exits are blocked
and you need to get back in.</i>

13:37.784 --> 13:41.121
<i>Room service.
How may I help you, Mr. Stone?</i>

13:41.221 --> 13:44.791
- I'd like to order some room service.
- <i>Yes.</i>

13:44.891 --> 13:48.161
I'll have the bibb lettuce salad
and the salmon.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.831
<i>Yes, sir. Would you like
anything to drink tonight?</i>

13:50.931 --> 13:53.066
No. I'll find something in the mini-bar.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.702
<i>Very good. Dessert? We have a...</i>

13:55.802 --> 13:59.786
- No, no, no, thanks.
- <i>Very good, sir.</i>

14:00.286 --> 14:02.142
<i>So that's a bibb lettuce, gorgonzola,</i>

14:02.242 --> 14:03.944
- <i>prosciutto, and walnut salad.</i>
- Yes.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.209
- <i>With honey raspberry vinaigrette dressing.</i>
- Yes.

14:06.309 --> 14:09.082
<i>And the wild-caught copper river
Alaska salmon amandine.</i>

14:09.182 --> 14:10.884
- Yes.
- <i>With baby asparagus...</i>

14:10.984 --> 14:13.119
- Yes.
- <i>...and the black truffle broth.</i>

14:13.219 --> 14:15.422
- Yes.
- <i>Very good.</i>

14:15.522 --> 14:18.759
- <i>And that's for room 1007?</i>
- Yes.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.896
<i>Very good. It's 9:13 now.</i>

14:22.996 --> 14:26.432
<i>It should be there within 35 minutes,
which will make it 9:48.</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:29.599
- Thank you.
- <i>Thank...</i>

14:44.450 --> 14:46.419
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.122
<i>Oh, hi. You just get in?</i>

14:49.222 --> 14:51.424
I'm at the hotel. How are you?

14:51.524 --> 14:54.628
<i>Pre-menstrual. How was the flight?</i>

14:54.728 --> 14:58.931
- It was okay. A little bumpy.
- <i>Oh, I hate that.</i>

14:59.031 --> 15:03.170
<i>Just a minute, Henry!
No, I'm on the phone!</i>

15:03.270 --> 15:05.405
<i>Just a minute!</i>

15:05.505 --> 15:08.275
- <i>What? No, it's daddy!</i>
- Donna.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.076
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Donna.

15:10.176 --> 15:13.030
- <i>Daddy!</i>
- Donna!

15:13.130 --> 15:16.086
- <i>He wants to say hi.</i>
- Okay. Donna, I don't want to...

15:16.186 --> 15:20.587
<i>Hold on. He's coming downstairs.
He's in his pirate suit.</i>

15:20.687 --> 15:24.324
<i>Come on, Henry. Daddy's waiting.</i>

15:24.424 --> 15:26.893
<i>Yes. It's long-distance!</i>

15:26.993 --> 15:29.059
<i>Jesus.</i>

15:29.329 --> 15:31.531
- <i>Here he is.</i>
- Okay.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.863
Hi, slugger.

15:34.768 --> 15:38.071
<i>Say something. It's long-distance.</i>

15:38.171 --> 15:40.973
<i>Hi, Daddy. I'm a pirate.</i>

15:41.073 --> 15:45.111
Are you? That's great.
I'm glad to hear your voice.

15:45.211 --> 15:49.449
- <i>Did you buy me something?</i>
- Not yet. But I will. I just got here.

15:49.549 --> 15:53.016
<i>Okay, I love you. Take care. Bye.</i>

15:53.454 --> 15:56.889
- <i>Well, he gets right to the point.</i>
- Yeah.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.222
<i>So...</i>

16:00.320 --> 16:02.095
<i>What else? I mean, how's your room?</i>

16:02.195 --> 16:05.298
It's... you know, it's a room.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.068
It's nice, I guess. Big bed.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.891
<i>Oh, that's good.
You can thrash about all you like.</i>

16:10.991 --> 16:14.307
Okay, Donna, it's not that I like it.
It's restlessness.

16:14.407 --> 16:18.708
<i>Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

16:19.512 --> 16:22.567
- <i>You doing anything tonight?</i>
- No.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.051
I ordered room service.

16:25.151 --> 16:30.458
I'll watch a movie or something.
I don't know. I should get some sleep.

16:30.558 --> 16:32.425
<i>Okay.</i>

16:32.525 --> 16:35.228
<i>Well, I better go.</i>

16:35.328 --> 16:39.932
- <i>I've got to get dinner together for Hen.</i>
- Okay. Have a good night.

16:40.032 --> 16:44.270
- <i>Okay. Good luck tomorrow.</i>
- Yeah, thanks.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.404
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

17:39.225 --> 17:44.130
"Thank you. It is my privilege today
to talk to you about customer service,

- Then why are you still here?
- I'm leaving. I just need to find my wallet.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.061
Why don't you find your balls

18:32.161 --> 18:34.064
You knew I didn't want to get married.

Yeah. Well, you agreed to it.
You're a grownup.

Yeah, I'm a grownup.
You remind me of that every day.

18:55.446 --> 19:00.156
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

19:00.256 --> 19:02.492
- Why don't you fuck off, bitch?
- You fuck off.

19:02.592 --> 19:04.260
My mother was right
when she said you're a bitch.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.068
- Fuck you. Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.534
Thank you.

19:44.634 --> 19:48.504
It is my privilege today to talk
to you about customer service.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.345
What it is and why...

19:52.074 --> 19:53.882
Shit.

19:57.380 --> 20:01.617
I mean, what the fuck did I do, Michael?

20:01.717 --> 20:05.455
It's a goddamn mystery.
It's like the goddamn mystery of the ages.

20:05.555 --> 20:07.795
Oh, shit.

20:08.928 --> 20:11.552
One minute, we were going to spend
the rest of our lives together,

20:11.652 --> 20:14.068
and the next...

20:15.097 --> 20:17.471
Amarossi. Okay.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.776
Hi, Bella. It's Michael.

20:35.851 --> 20:37.754
Shit.

20:37.854 --> 20:41.023
Hi, Bella, it's Michael. Hi, Bella...

20:41.123 --> 20:43.698
Hi, Bella, it's Michael.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.335
Fuck.

20:51.968 --> 20:53.842
Six...

21:05.781 --> 21:07.689
<i>Hello?</i>

21:10.219 --> 21:13.256
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

21:13.756 --> 21:17.693
May I speak to Bella Amarossi, please?

21:18.093 --> 21:20.931
- <i>This is Bella.</i>
- Bella?

21:21.431 --> 21:25.135
Hi, I wasn't sure... Hi... I...

21:26.235 --> 21:29.389
- It's... It's Michael.
- <i>Who is this?</i>

21:29.489 --> 21:32.709
I didn't recognize your voice.

21:32.809 --> 21:36.779
- <i>Michael?</i>
- Michael Stone. Michael Stone. From...

21:36.879 --> 21:39.782
<i>Oh, my God! Michael?</i>

21:39.882 --> 21:42.123
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

21:43.085 --> 21:46.656
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm in Cincinnati on business and I...

21:46.756 --> 21:49.425
thought of you and I looked you up
in the phone book

21:49.525 --> 21:53.101
and there you were, so...

21:54.096 --> 21:56.232
<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>

21:56.332 --> 21:58.534
Yours, too.

21:59.355 --> 22:01.442
<i>I'm shaking.</i>

22:01.937 --> 22:05.908
- <i>Jesus, how long has it been?</i>
- Ten years.

22:06.008 --> 22:07.743
<i>Eleven.</i>

22:07.843 --> 22:09.918
Oh, right.

22:11.113 --> 22:13.383
I'm married.

22:13.683 --> 22:15.785
I have a kid.

22:17.486 --> 22:19.593
<i>That's great.</i>

22:20.056 --> 22:23.659
- <i>Congratulations.</i>
- Thanks. You?

22:23.759 --> 22:25.633
<i>No.</i>

22:27.830 --> 22:30.032
I've missed you.

22:30.132 --> 22:32.006
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:33.135 --> 22:36.739
- <i>That's a weird thing to say.</i>
- I know. I'm sorry.

22:36.839 --> 22:38.508
<i>Well...</i>

22:38.608 --> 22:41.944
<i>it doesn't matter.
It's all water under the fucking bridge.</i>

22:42.044 --> 22:43.579
<i>The fucking bridge.</i>

22:43.679 --> 22:48.784
Yeah. Well, I am sorry.
I do think about you a lot.

22:48.884 --> 22:53.122
<i>Yeah. I guess the postcards
must've gotten lost in the mail.</i>

22:55.425 --> 22:58.594
Do you want to maybe get a drink, Bella?

23:00.997 --> 23:03.265
<i>I don't know, Michael.</i>

23:03.365 --> 23:05.668
<i>This is all very intense.</i>

23:05.768 --> 23:07.704
<i>It's like out of the blue.</i>

23:07.804 --> 23:11.708
<i>I just came out of this stupid relationship
with a psycho. And I just...</i>

23:11.808 --> 23:13.881
<i>I don't know, I'm not sure
you want to be the victim</i>

23:13.981 --> 23:17.580
<i>to my current emotional imbalance tonight.</i>

23:17.880 --> 23:22.958
Yeah. Well, I understand.

23:24.086 --> 23:27.590
<i>I mean, I could, I guess. I don't know.</i>

23:27.690 --> 23:30.159
<i>Jesus, Michael, it's been so fucking long.</i>

23:30.259 --> 23:33.929
- <i>And you just call? Out of nowhere?</i>
- I'm sorry. It was stupid.

23:34.029 --> 23:38.439
Everything's just screwed-up.
I'm not thinking straight.

23:41.787 --> 23:44.377
There's something wrong with me.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.410
<i>Well, where are you staying?</i>

23:48.510 --> 23:50.312
The Fregoli.

23:50.412 --> 23:52.648
<i>La-di-da, you're doing well.</i>

23:52.748 --> 23:57.291
You know. It's boring.
Everything's boring.

23:58.988 --> 24:01.266
<i>Okay, I could meet you there.</i>

24:01.366 --> 24:05.728
<i>At the bar. I have to go to work early,
so... I can't stay very long.</i>

24:05.828 --> 24:07.930
Yeah, that sounds great.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.638
It'll be lovely to see you.

24:11.133 --> 24:13.908
<i>This is really weird.</i>

24:15.605 --> 24:16.814
<i>I've gained some weight.</i>

24:16.914 --> 24:20.406
<i>Not terrible or anything, but... so you
don't look at me freaked-out or something,</i>

24:20.506 --> 24:23.079
- <i>because I just couldn't handle that.</i>
- I wouldn't do that.

24:23.179 --> 24:25.019
<i>Okay.</i>

24:25.948 --> 24:30.319
<i>And I have a fake tooth in the front because
I fell and hit a cement bench with my mouth.</i>

24:30.419 --> 24:33.889
<i>But I don't think you can tell.
They matched it pretty well.</i>

24:33.989 --> 24:35.864
Okay.

24:37.092 --> 24:39.867
I look forward to seeing you.

24:41.030 --> 24:44.472
- <i>Bye, Michael.</i>
- Bye, Bella.

24:59.982 --> 25:03.024
<i>Soak a towel, and place it in the space...</i>

25:03.950 --> 25:05.545
<i>What is the meaning of this, may I ask?</i>

25:05.645 --> 25:07.840
<i>Mother, Godfrey loves me.
He put me in the shower.</i>

25:07.940 --> 25:10.678
- <i>What ever are you talking about?</i>
- <i>Godfrey loves me. Godfrey loves me.</i>

25:10.778 --> 25:12.229
<i>I demand an explanation.</i>

25:12.329 --> 25:15.563
- <i>I think, perhaps, that I had better resign.</i>
- Yes, I think you'd better.

25:15.663 --> 25:18.067
<i>That's a very good idea. What do you think
your father would say to all this?</i>

25:18.167 --> 25:20.136
<i>I don't care what anybody says.
Godfrey loves me.</i>

25:20.236 --> 25:22.470
<i>Now see here, young lady, you take
a bath and put on some dry clothes.</i>

25:22.570 --> 25:24.519
<i>And come downstairs immediately.
Do you hear?</i>

25:24.619 --> 25:27.488
<i>I've never heard of anything
like this in my life.</i>

25:35.117 --> 25:37.359
There you are. Hey.

25:51.533 --> 25:53.402
Michael?

25:53.702 --> 25:55.543
Bella!

26:00.009 --> 26:01.911
You look great.

26:02.011 --> 26:04.013
Thank you.

26:04.113 --> 26:05.953
You, too.

26:06.449 --> 26:08.990
Have a seat. Please.

26:12.521 --> 26:16.392
It's really lovely to see you.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.270
Thanks.

26:19.762 --> 26:22.665
Let me get the waitress' attention.

26:22.765 --> 26:26.073
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:27.169 --> 26:30.411
It's busier here than I would've thought.

26:31.407 --> 26:34.548
Hi. Do you know what you want?

26:36.077 --> 26:40.216
- I... what are you having, Michael?
- A Belvedere martini with a twist.

26:40.316 --> 26:43.419
Same old Michael. I'll have one of those.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.628
- Make it two.
- Back in a minute.

26:48.157 --> 26:49.959
So...

26:50.659 --> 26:53.129
You look good.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.669
Tell me what's going on.

26:55.831 --> 26:59.869
Not too much. I'm embarrassed to say.

26:59.969 --> 27:03.859
I'm working for the state,
doing graphics for the health department.

27:03.959 --> 27:06.309
- Graphics?
- Yeah, I design pamphlets.

27:06.409 --> 27:11.047
You know, teen pregnancy, STDs, diabetes.

27:11.147 --> 27:13.782
I see. Well, that sounds interesting.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.951
It's okay.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.288
My boss is a dick.

27:18.388 --> 27:23.330
I guess that fits right in
with the teen pregnancy and the STDs.

27:27.497 --> 27:31.495
- Do I look bad? I look bad, don't I?
- No, you look good.

27:39.341 --> 27:41.915
Why did you go, Michael?

27:43.545 --> 27:45.815
I don't know.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.151
I can't explain.

27:48.251 --> 27:52.321
Here we are. Two Belvedere
martinis straight-up with twists.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.724
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:54.824 --> 27:57.293
You're welcome. Enjoy.

27:57.393 --> 27:59.495
Old times.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.868
Old times.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.061
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

28:11.206 --> 28:13.948
- I've missed you.
- Me, too.

28:16.846 --> 28:20.282
- Try to.
- Try to what?

28:20.382 --> 28:22.690
Try to explain.

28:25.521 --> 28:29.458
I think I might have...

28:29.558 --> 28:31.928
psychological problems.

28:32.428 --> 28:35.000
Oh, good. That clears things up. Thanks.

28:35.100 --> 28:39.428
It's hard to explain.
I've been running for a long time now.

28:39.768 --> 28:41.804
Running?

28:41.904 --> 28:45.240
We were special together.
That's what I thought.

28:45.340 --> 28:49.211
Yeah. I agree. But things kind of shifted.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.814
But just like completely suddenly?

28:51.914 --> 28:55.589
I was so pissed at you.
I was so fucking hurt.

28:57.086 --> 29:00.055
I didn't get out of bed for a year.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.424
Do you realize that?

29:02.524 --> 29:04.332
Jesus.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.202
I'm sorry.

29:11.233 --> 29:13.802
God, you drank that fast.

29:13.902 --> 29:16.477
I get a lot of practice.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.676
Listen, do you feel that you changed?

29:20.776 --> 29:24.180
- I mean, do you feel that you changed?
- What are you talking about?

29:24.280 --> 29:28.384
I don't know. I don't know. Like, in any way?
Like, in any way did you change?

29:28.484 --> 29:32.121
Like, while we were together.
Like, did I change you? Did you change?

29:32.221 --> 29:35.091
Did anything change?
Did a change occur? Did a...

29:35.191 --> 29:39.261
Michael, you're freaking me out. I can't
take being more freaked out right now.

29:39.361 --> 29:42.103
I'm sorry. I'm a mess. I'm just...

29:45.001 --> 29:48.237
Do you want to maybe go up
to my room for another drink?

29:48.337 --> 29:50.806
We could talk more privately.

29:50.906 --> 29:53.402
What? We're not going to fuck, Michael.

29:53.502 --> 29:56.617
I wasn't... I just...

29:57.146 --> 30:00.583
I'm just really bloody lonely,
and we had something.

30:00.683 --> 30:03.385
- And I thought maybe we could figure out...
- You've got to be kidding.

30:03.485 --> 30:05.354
This isn't going well.
I'll just get the check then. Miss?

30:05.454 --> 30:07.423
- Jesus. What?
- Miss?

30:07.523 --> 30:10.392
I can't... I can't believe you.

30:10.492 --> 30:15.231
- Fuck you, Michael. Fuck off.
- Bella! I'm just trying to understand!

30:15.331 --> 30:18.805
- Isn't that Michael Stone?
- It's Michael Stone, yes.

30:23.372 --> 30:27.309
...and the next minute you're out the door
with barely a goodbye.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.916
Have a good fucking life, Michael.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.121
Love, Bella.

30:55.737 --> 30:58.474
Hello. May I help you?

30:59.174 --> 31:04.213
Hello there.
I am looking for a toy for my son, Henry.

31:04.313 --> 31:07.554
Perhaps you've heard of him,
he's a pirate.

31:15.324 --> 31:19.695
Oh, dear, this is not quite
the store I expected.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.297
No, I suppose not those kind of toys.

31:22.397 --> 31:24.672
It's not my night.

31:25.601 --> 31:28.454
What's... what's that behind you?

31:28.804 --> 31:32.174
Oh, that? That's an antique.
It's Japanese.

31:32.274 --> 31:34.715
It's quite unusual.

31:35.510 --> 31:37.585
It's pretty.

31:51.627 --> 31:54.062
Hot. Hot.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.970
Hot!

31:57.844 --> 32:00.903
Fuck! Fuck!

32:01.003 --> 32:03.772
Cold! Fuck you! Fuck!

32:03.872 --> 32:05.908
Fuck you!

32:06.008 --> 32:07.810
Fuck!

32:09.215 --> 32:12.721
Okay. There we go.

33:25.955 --> 33:29.688
Anyway, I can't wait to see you
when I get back. How's Thursday?

33:29.788 --> 33:32.161
No, it's super-fancy.

33:32.261 --> 33:35.497
- Oh, my God. Is he cute?
- Jesus.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.908
Someone else.

33:43.372 --> 33:45.941
Where are my fucking pants?

33:46.041 --> 33:47.881
Fuck!

34:11.867 --> 34:16.177
Hello, miss? Shit. Shit!

34:24.012 --> 34:24.914
Yes?

34:25.014 --> 34:27.583
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was just looking for my friend's room.

34:27.683 --> 34:28.884
- Not here.
- I'm sorry.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.058
It's okay.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.929
Hi!

34:41.030 --> 34:43.264
Hello. Can I help you?
I thought you were someone else.

34:43.364 --> 34:46.034
No, sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

34:46.134 --> 34:48.208
That's okay.

34:51.973 --> 34:54.243
Yes? Yes?

34:54.342 --> 34:57.045
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for...

34:57.145 --> 35:01.016
- Who is it?
- My name's Michael Stone.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.491
Hold on!

35:04.720 --> 35:07.989
Hi! Oh, my God! It's you.

35:08.089 --> 35:11.827
- Hi, I'm sorry to bother you...
- No. Not at all!

35:11.927 --> 35:14.196
Do you want to come in?

35:14.296 --> 35:17.532
I was just looking for someone.
I think I've got the wrong...

35:17.632 --> 35:20.802
- Who's there, Em?
- It's Mr. Stone! Michael Stone!

35:20.902 --> 35:22.571
Really?

35:22.671 --> 35:24.606
Oh, my God.

35:24.706 --> 35:27.776
Oh, my God. Hello.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.878
Do I look awful?
I was just taking my makeup off.

35:29.978 --> 35:33.215
- Oh, my God. Don't look at me.
- Hello.

35:33.315 --> 35:35.217
No, you look lovely.

35:35.317 --> 35:37.753
I can't believe you're in our room.

35:37.853 --> 35:41.390
We came here from Akron
just to hear you speak.

35:41.490 --> 35:45.327
- Oh, my God. Please don't look at me.
- Well, I'm certainly very flattered.

35:45.427 --> 35:47.496
- You can look at me.
- Emily.

35:47.596 --> 35:49.398
Is there something we can do for you?

35:49.498 --> 35:53.502
I mean... I don't mean that in a weird way.
Although... No, I'm kidding!

35:53.702 --> 35:57.389
- I'm just... Oh, my God.
- I was...

35:57.489 --> 36:00.976
I was trying to find my friend.
I thought this was his room. And...

36:01.076 --> 36:05.247
Oh, nope. Nope.
Unless he's hiding under the bed!

36:05.347 --> 36:09.256
We think you're super-brilliant.
We both read your book.

36:10.051 --> 36:12.715
Yay for your book!

36:13.255 --> 36:15.262
Thank you.

36:15.624 --> 36:18.077
Are you ladies in customer services?

36:18.177 --> 36:21.496
Well, yes, as a matter of fact,
we're both team leaders in a phone room.

36:21.596 --> 36:26.668
We read your book and productivity
went up 90% in our department.

36:26.768 --> 36:30.672
You're so smart. I'm not sure I should
even say words in front of you,

36:30.772 --> 36:33.475
because you'll see how dumb I am.
Shut up, Lisa.

36:33.575 --> 36:38.280
No, don't. Don't shut up, Lisa.
You have a miraculous voice.

36:38.580 --> 36:41.817
Oh, God, no! Yick. Me?

36:41.917 --> 36:44.853
Yick. No way. No way.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.389
Lisa, you're being nuts.

36:47.489 --> 36:51.059
Say, would you ladies like to get
a drink at the bar, maybe?

36:51.159 --> 36:57.148
We could chat.
Talk about phone system innovations.

36:59.401 --> 37:03.705
Yeah. I think we could manage that.
Right, Lisa?

37:03.805 --> 37:07.762
- Do you need to find your friend, though?
- No.

37:08.177 --> 37:12.581
Two beautiful ladies trumps my friend.

37:12.681 --> 37:16.618
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much. I'm blushing.

37:16.718 --> 37:20.021
Yes, thank you so much.

37:20.421 --> 37:23.063
I'm blushing, too.

37:24.726 --> 37:26.995
I can't believe we bumped into you.

37:27.095 --> 37:31.132
You know, we sprung for this hotel
because this is like a mini-vacation for us.

37:31.232 --> 37:34.503
We can't even afford it.
But look what happened.

37:34.603 --> 37:36.871
It's so worth it.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.791
I love this song.

37:39.891 --> 37:45.401
<i># How I long to be near... #</i>

37:49.384 --> 37:51.303
Shut up, Lisa.

37:51.403 --> 37:54.110
I even got a massage tonight in the room.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.565
It's good to splurge every now and again.

37:56.825 --> 37:59.578
Emily and I work for Tessman in Akron.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.747
We're only customer service reps,
so you can imagine our salaries.

38:02.847 --> 38:05.234
- Tessman?
- Tessman Foods.

38:05.334 --> 38:09.070
We make packaged bakery items
shipped all over the Midwest.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.973
Nibble-O's, Choco-bricks,

38:12.073 --> 38:16.628
Apple-Flats, Strawberry Trifles,
Knick-Knacks, Scroochies?

38:16.728 --> 38:20.365
Oh, yes. Yes. Splendid. I'm familiar.

38:20.465 --> 38:24.019
- Brownie Balls, don't forget.
- Brownie Balls. Yeah, they're new.

38:24.119 --> 38:28.139
- Hello again. What can I get you?
- Oh, hi.

38:28.239 --> 38:31.242
Do you ladies know what you want?

38:31.342 --> 38:34.929
I'll have an apple mojito, please.
Can you make those with apple schnapps?

38:35.029 --> 38:37.366
- Yum. Yum. Yum.
- I think probably.

38:37.466 --> 38:40.635
That sounds really, really good.
I'll have the same.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.472
- And for you, sir?
- Belvedere martini,

38:43.572 --> 38:47.826
- dry, straight-up, twist.
- I'll be back in a minute.

38:47.976 --> 38:51.012
So, what do you ladies do for fun?

38:51.112 --> 38:54.616
- Besides drinking?
- Emily, stop! God!

38:54.716 --> 38:59.454
- Well, I like to drink.
- I do, too. But we do lots of other things.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.556
- We hike and bike ride.
- Yeah.

39:01.656 --> 39:06.561
I love to read. Go to the movies.
I'm pretty good at Scrabble.

39:06.661 --> 39:09.631
- Strip poker...
- Emily!

39:09.731 --> 39:13.302
- Have you two been friends long?
- Since junior high.

39:13.402 --> 39:16.443
Oh, I play the Jew's harp a little.

39:17.773 --> 39:21.415
I don't like to say "Jew's harp"
because it's offensive to Jews.

39:22.844 --> 39:25.981
Anyway, I bought one of those...
self-teaching...

39:26.081 --> 39:28.249
Self-teaching?

39:28.349 --> 39:31.378
Is that right? Or is it self-learning?

39:31.478 --> 39:33.705
The Jew's harp
is an underrated instrument.

39:33.805 --> 39:38.165
I know! People think of it
as just this thing, you know?

39:39.628 --> 39:42.097
Here we are, folks. Two apple mojitos.

39:42.197 --> 39:43.465
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

39:43.565 --> 39:45.900
You're welcome. And one more Belvedere
martini for the gentleman.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.836
Thanks.

39:47.936 --> 39:50.543
To... us.

39:51.707 --> 39:55.176
Hurry, hurry. We're gonna miss
the elevator. Go. Go, go, go!

39:55.276 --> 39:59.914
Emily, stop it. What floor are we, anyway?

40:00.014 --> 40:02.517
- Ten.
- Are you sure? I think...

40:02.617 --> 40:06.021
No, I want to press it! Darn it.

40:06.121 --> 40:07.923
Sorry. My hand just jumped.

40:08.023 --> 40:10.759
- I love pressing the buttons.
- I'm sorry.

40:10.859 --> 40:13.294
You always get to press it, Lisa.
Don't be greedy.

40:13.394 --> 40:16.898
I know. 'Cause I love it.
It's so... I don't know...

40:16.998 --> 40:20.001
Buttony. No, that's not it.

40:20.101 --> 40:22.309
Buttonish?

40:23.972 --> 40:26.775
Is it stupid to like to press buttons?

40:26.875 --> 40:28.610
Shut up, Lisa.

40:28.710 --> 40:31.546
Pressing buttons is good clean fun.

40:31.646 --> 40:35.384
Exactly! That's exactly right. See, Em?

40:35.484 --> 40:39.754
- It was nice getting to meet you ladies.
- It was an honor spending time with you.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.123
- Thank you for all those mojitos!
- My pleasure.

40:42.223 --> 40:44.459
Yes, thank you kindly.

40:44.559 --> 40:48.263
Mojitos. Mojitos. What a funny word.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.831
You're welcome.

40:50.231 --> 40:55.042
Mojitos.

41:00.176 --> 41:01.691
Well...

41:01.791 --> 41:05.377
I go this way, so I'll say good night.

41:05.480 --> 41:09.818
- Oh, pooh.
- Yeah, pooh on you. Pooh, pooh, pooh.

41:09.918 --> 41:12.158
Good night, Michael.

41:13.688 --> 41:17.017
- Say good night, Lisa.
- Good night, Michael.

41:17.117 --> 41:19.750
- Pooh.
- Good night.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.735
Oh, Lisa?

41:27.035 --> 41:28.409
Yes?

41:31.239 --> 41:36.611
I was wondering if maybe you'd want
to come to my room for a little nightcap.

41:38.146 --> 41:40.949
I feel odd asking in front of you, Emily.
But I didn't know how else...

41:41.049 --> 41:43.651
No, no. That's okay.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.754
I understand.

41:46.154 --> 41:48.423
You sure you don't mean Emily?

41:48.523 --> 41:51.065
Everyone always likes Emily better.

41:54.695 --> 41:56.498
This is awkward.

41:56.598 --> 41:59.668
I'm going to the room, Lisa.
I'll see you later maybe. Have fun.

41:59.768 --> 42:03.171
Em, I came here with you.
I'm not going to just abandon you.

42:03.271 --> 42:07.015
Oh, don't be an idiot, Lisa.
He's gorgeous.

42:09.778 --> 42:12.046
Yeah, it's okay?

42:12.146 --> 42:14.987
Have fun. Good night.

42:17.786 --> 42:20.755
So, I'm over this way.

42:20.855 --> 42:22.729
Okay.

42:24.426 --> 42:26.728
- Have fun.
- Good night.

42:26.828 --> 42:28.930
Oh, Jesus!

42:29.330 --> 42:31.566
Are you okay?

42:31.666 --> 42:35.942
I'm okay, I'm okay.
It happens all the time.

43:29.758 --> 43:31.660
Look how neat you left your room,

43:31.760 --> 43:33.828
with the little slippers
laid out next to the bed

43:33.928 --> 43:37.332
and the blanket turned down
all ready for sleepy time.

43:37.932 --> 43:40.935
No, the maid did that.
They come and fix it up at night.

43:41.035 --> 43:45.707
- It's called turn-down service.
- Oh, God. I'm so embarrassed.

43:45.807 --> 43:49.010
Lisa the moron. I don't...
I don't stay in hotels like this.

43:49.110 --> 43:52.306
Emily and I splurged, because
it's like a vacation. I'm an idiot.

43:52.406 --> 43:54.649
No, you're not.

43:54.749 --> 43:59.354
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please. I would really like a drink.

43:59.454 --> 44:03.091
I don't think I can make an apple mojito.
I can order one.

44:03.191 --> 44:07.735
No, that's okay.
I'll just have a glass of wine, please.

44:10.131 --> 44:12.867
I'm glad to get you alone for a while.

44:12.967 --> 44:15.475
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:16.671 --> 44:20.608
You don't like Emily?
Everybody likes Emily.

44:20.708 --> 44:23.945
Emily's a prince... ess.

44:24.045 --> 44:27.382
- Emily's a princess.
- She's very nice.

44:27.482 --> 44:32.020
I just felt...
a sort of special thing with you.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.956
Really?

44:34.956 --> 44:37.964
Most people like Emily.

44:38.927 --> 44:41.129
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

44:41.229 --> 44:43.184
Thank you.

44:53.008 --> 44:57.384
Most people don't really like to look
at me too much because, you know...

45:00.248 --> 45:03.384
I think you're lovely.

45:03.484 --> 45:06.059
No, you don't.

45:06.655 --> 45:09.825
I've always done phone work because
I'd never get hired to work in a store

45:09.925 --> 45:12.232
or a restaurant or...

45:13.361 --> 45:16.765
How did it happen?

45:16.865 --> 45:19.885
If it's okay for me to ask?

45:20.235 --> 45:22.037
I don't...

45:22.137 --> 45:24.711
I don't like to talk about it.

45:26.474 --> 45:29.015
May I kiss you there?

45:29.577 --> 45:31.784
Oh, my God.

45:32.113 --> 45:35.638
Oh, my God. No. Oh, God.

45:35.738 --> 45:37.717
S... sorry.

45:40.372 --> 45:44.325
You're not like a pervert or something?
Like some weird version of a chubby chaser?

45:44.425 --> 45:46.266
No.

45:47.028 --> 45:50.837
I just don't understand
why you would want to kiss me there.

45:51.265 --> 45:55.586
Because... because I like you.

45:57.638 --> 45:59.446
Why?

46:00.108 --> 46:03.378
I mean, I'm not smart like Emily.
And I'm ugly.

46:03.478 --> 46:06.381
You're a really smart guy.
You should like Emily.

46:06.481 --> 46:10.118
I don't even understand a lot of the words
in your book. I sat there with a dictionary.

46:10.218 --> 46:14.489
I try to learn. But I'm never going
to be smart. And I'm ugly.

46:14.589 --> 46:19.632
I find it enormously charming that you read
any book with a dictionary next to you.

46:48.456 --> 46:53.461
My last boyfriend was eight years ago.
And he wasn't even my boyfriend.

46:53.561 --> 46:57.933
He was almost 60 and fat
and he worked in Human Resources

46:58.033 --> 47:01.770
and he had a wife
and his daughter was older than me.

47:01.870 --> 47:06.240
And the only reason he pursued me was
because he thought he'd have a good shot.

47:06.340 --> 47:08.414
Which he did.

47:10.311 --> 47:12.985
I think you're extraordinary.

47:20.187 --> 47:21.994
Why?

47:22.757 --> 47:24.626
I don't know yet.

47:24.926 --> 47:27.695
It's just obvious to me that you are.

47:27.795 --> 47:29.698
I never went to college.

47:29.798 --> 47:33.001
I've never even made it past
team leader in my department.

47:33.101 --> 47:36.437
Your voice is like...

47:36.837 --> 47:38.278
magic.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.114
Oh, really?

47:44.763 --> 47:49.651
Well, you know, I have been doing
phone work for a really long time now,

47:49.751 --> 47:53.755
so I pride myself on sounding
pleasant and professional,

47:53.855 --> 47:56.991
and having a pleasing
phone voice and manner.

47:57.091 --> 47:59.327
It works. Do you sing?

48:00.827 --> 48:03.331
What? No.

48:03.431 --> 48:06.935
No! God! You're weird!

48:07.035 --> 48:10.104
I mean, I sing. Everybody sings.
I just don't sing well.

48:10.204 --> 48:12.607
I sometimes sing along with the radio.

48:12.707 --> 48:14.876
I love Cyndi Lauper.

48:14.976 --> 48:18.647
Because she's got such a great voice and she
doesn't care what people think about her.

48:18.747 --> 48:22.507
She's just herself, and that takes
a lot of courage. I admire that.

48:22.607 --> 48:25.687
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. I think so.

48:25.787 --> 48:28.200
Would you sing one of her songs for me?

48:28.300 --> 48:30.759
- No!
- Come on.

48:30.859 --> 48:33.748
Come on. It'd make me so happy
to hear you sing.

48:34.028 --> 48:38.539
- You're being weird.
- Please. It'll make me happy.

48:40.701 --> 48:42.742
I don't know.

48:47.842 --> 48:50.578
Okay, crazy man.

48:50.678 --> 48:52.919
Just a little.

48:53.214 --> 48:55.667
Okay, here goes.

48:55.767 --> 48:58.090
Don't laugh at me.

49:03.825 --> 49:07.362
<i># I come home in the morning light</i>

49:07.462 --> 49:13.568
<i># My mother says
when you gonna live your life right</i>

49:13.668 --> 49:17.672
<i># Oh, mother, dear,
we're not the fortunate ones</i>

49:17.772 --> 49:21.842
<i># And girls, they wanna have fun</i>

49:21.942 --> 49:27.048
<i># Oh, girls just wanna have fun</i>

49:27.148 --> 49:30.285
<i># Some boys take a beautiful girl</i>

49:30.385 --> 49:35.590
<i># And hide her away
from the rest of the world</i>

49:35.690 --> 49:40.361
<i># I want to be the one to walk in the sun</i>

49:40.461 --> 49:44.198
<i># And girls, they wanna have fun</i>

49:44.298 --> 49:47.668
<i># Oh, girls just wanna have</i>

49:47.768 --> 49:51.806
<i># That's all they really want</i>

49:51.906 --> 49:55.176
<i># Some fun</i>

49:55.276 --> 49:58.813
<i># When the working day is done</i>

49:58.913 --> 50:02.717
<i># Oh, girls, they wanna have fun</i>

50:02.817 --> 50:08.523
<i># Oh, girls just wanna have fun #</i>

50:08.723 --> 50:10.391
That's beautiful...

50:10.491 --> 50:12.960
<i># Girls, they want</i>

50:13.060 --> 50:16.530
<i># Wanna have fun, girls</i>

50:16.630 --> 50:18.266
<i># They wanna have</i>

50:18.366 --> 50:22.036
<i># Just wanna, they just wanna</i>

50:22.136 --> 50:25.373
<i># Just wanna, they just wanna</i>

50:25.473 --> 50:28.609
<i># Oh, girls just wanna</i>

50:28.709 --> 50:31.879
<i># Just wanna have fun #</i>

50:31.979 --> 50:35.483
Okay. That's it. Happy?

50:35.583 --> 50:38.787
- That was so beautiful.
- No, it was...

50:39.287 --> 50:42.295
Oh, my God, are those tears?

50:42.923 --> 50:45.379
It was beautiful.

50:45.479 --> 50:49.898
It's such a great song. "I want to
be the one who walks in the sun."

50:49.998 --> 50:53.640
That describes so perfectly
who I want to be.

50:54.369 --> 50:57.872
You're so sensitive, Michael.
It's incredibly sweet.

50:57.972 --> 51:00.609
It's your voice, Lisa.

51:01.209 --> 51:05.353
- Keep talking. Tell me everything.
- You're, like, amazing.

51:05.453 --> 51:07.648
Why are you doing this?
Are you making fun of me?

51:07.748 --> 51:10.623
No. No.

51:15.022 --> 51:18.676
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

51:18.776 --> 51:21.339
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

51:22.363 --> 51:26.551
Will you... will you kiss me again?

51:27.351 --> 51:29.387
I hope to.

51:29.487 --> 51:32.911
I hope you do, too. Sometime.

52:04.188 --> 52:08.081
I haven't been with anybody
in eight years.

52:10.428 --> 52:15.171
Let's just lie together
and you can tell me about your day.

52:16.934 --> 52:19.101
Yes. Okay.

52:24.042 --> 52:28.412
Well, Em picked me up at, like, 7:00
this morning so we could drive down here.

52:28.512 --> 52:32.917
We stopped at Starbucks
and I got a Grande Mocha Frappuccino.

52:33.017 --> 52:34.685
Emily got a Grande Chai.

52:34.785 --> 52:37.555
I looked at the road atlas and figured
it's a little over 200 miles,

52:37.655 --> 52:39.991
so at 60 miles an hour,
we could do it in under four hours

52:40.091 --> 52:42.660
with bathroom breaks and whatever.

52:42.760 --> 52:48.499
The 71 goes pretty much
straight here, so it was easy.

52:48.599 --> 52:51.436
We listened to a lot of No Doubt,
which Em likes.

52:51.536 --> 52:54.072
And I brought my Sarah Brightman CDs.

52:54.172 --> 52:59.907
She sings this beautiful version of
<i>Girls Just Want to Have Fun</i> in Italian.

53:00.007 --> 53:04.486
It's called <i>Le Ragazze Vogliono Meglio.</i>

53:05.716 --> 53:07.718
Do you want to hear it?

53:07.818 --> 53:09.659
Please.

53:35.813 --> 53:38.929
- Very pretty.
- Oh, my God, it is.

53:39.029 --> 53:41.986
I want to learn Italian someday.
It's so wonderful.

53:42.086 --> 53:44.927
It's just so romantic.

53:45.856 --> 53:48.097
Keep talking.

53:49.493 --> 53:51.595
I like different languages.

53:51.695 --> 53:54.465
I love French and Italian the most.

53:54.565 --> 53:57.301
I don't like German. It sounds mean to me.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.809
All those "ach's."

54:00.304 --> 54:02.573
And I love Japanese, obviously.

54:02.673 --> 54:07.778
Oh, I love Portuguese.
I love to listen to Brazilian singers.

54:07.878 --> 54:13.351
They sing in Portuguese in Brazil,
a little-known fact.

54:13.451 --> 54:17.227
It's kind of weird because
it's the only country in South America

54:17.327 --> 54:19.724
where they sing in Portuguese.

54:19.824 --> 54:22.398
It's an anomaly, right?

54:23.327 --> 54:25.904
I learned that word in your book.

54:26.004 --> 54:27.632
I like that word.

54:27.732 --> 54:31.769
Anomaly. I like the way it sounds
and I like what it means.

54:31.869 --> 54:33.905
I feel like an anomaly.

54:34.005 --> 54:37.181
Before I used to know there was
a word for it, it made me

54:37.281 --> 54:42.546
feel bad to be different.
Now I kind of like it. Sometimes.

54:42.646 --> 54:46.083
I mean, not a lot, but sometimes.

54:46.183 --> 54:48.452
It makes me special, sort of.

54:48.552 --> 54:50.860
You know what I mean?

54:52.756 --> 54:55.225
Anomalisa.

54:55.325 --> 54:58.496
Oh, I love that!

54:58.596 --> 55:02.471
It's like "anomaly" plus my name.

55:03.301 --> 55:06.570
Will you call me that all the time?
I guess it's long to say "all the time."

55:06.670 --> 55:10.019
I mean, I guess I'm assuming
there is going to be an "all the time."

55:10.119 --> 55:12.443
There's not going to be
an "all the time," is there?

55:12.543 --> 55:16.617
It's just now.
Some weird thing for just now.

55:16.717 --> 55:20.940
It's okay, though.
It's really nice for just now.

55:21.485 --> 55:23.926
It's an anomaly.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.986
- Sorry. What? Did I tickle you?
- Just a little.

55:46.086 --> 55:47.678
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

55:47.778 --> 55:51.349
- Just right there I'm a little ticklish.
- Okay. I won't touch you there.

55:51.449 --> 55:53.588
- No, you can. It's okay.
- No. It's okay.

55:53.688 --> 55:55.891
No, it's okay.

56:01.392 --> 56:05.801
Do you talk during sex?

56:06.430 --> 56:09.766
God! I don't know! It's been a long time.

56:09.866 --> 56:12.836
Do you want me to?
Or not? I could do either.

56:12.936 --> 56:14.772
If you could.

56:14.872 --> 56:18.842
Or just, you know...

56:18.942 --> 56:21.750
make some noises.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.715
- Noises?
- Like moaning or something.

56:24.815 --> 56:28.558
Oh. Okay. I could do that.

56:34.024 --> 56:36.065
That's nice.

56:37.261 --> 56:40.731
- Does this feel okay?
- Yes. Sorry. I'm just... I'm a little shy.

56:40.831 --> 56:43.100
Oh, it's fine.

56:44.301 --> 56:45.669
- My hair.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

56:45.769 --> 56:48.272
- It's okay. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

56:48.372 --> 56:51.491
Maybe if we can just turn
a little bit like this?

56:51.591 --> 56:53.465
Sure.

56:56.780 --> 56:58.515
- Is that better?
- Much.

56:58.615 --> 57:00.427
Good.

57:07.390 --> 57:10.260
You feel so good.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.696
You do, too.

57:15.099 --> 57:17.017
What? You don't want that?

57:17.117 --> 57:20.555
No, I'm just...
I'm kind of shy about that, too.

57:20.655 --> 57:24.289
Don't be shy. It'll be good.
I really want to.

57:25.008 --> 57:26.844
Okay.

57:27.244 --> 57:29.485
Okay, go ahead.

57:57.341 --> 57:59.577
You're being quiet. Is it not good?

57:59.677 --> 58:02.585
No, it's fine. It's good. It's...

58:03.181 --> 58:07.101
Just a little bit more gentle maybe.
At first, maybe.

58:07.201 --> 58:10.075
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

58:19.629 --> 58:22.725
- Better?
- Yes.

58:38.782 --> 58:41.757
Could you come up here, please?

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:35.203
That was really nice.

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:46.877
I don't want to lose you.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:49.551
I lose everyone.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:52.554
What do you mean?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.858
I don't know.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:01:00.162
It doesn't matter.

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:55.579
Hello?

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:57.848
<i>Hello, Mr. Stone?</i>

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.650
- Yes.
- It's early. Who is it?

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.585
<i>Good morning, sir.
My name is Lawrence Gill</i>

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:04.688
- <i>and I'm the General Manager of the hotel.</i>
- Yes?

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:07.825
<i>I have a matter of some delicacy
I need to talk to you about.</i>

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:09.727
- What's going on?
- Who is it?

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:14.636
<i>Would it be possible for you to come down
to my office to chat for a few moments?</i>

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.336
- I suppose.
- <i>I'd greatly appreciate it.</i>

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:22.806
<i>If you take the elevator to the basement
level and turn left when you get off,</i>

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:26.843
<i>you'll see the administrative offices.
You can just ask for me.</i>

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:30.519
- <i>My name is Lawrence Gill.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:43.765
Who was that?

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.171
Lawrence Gill.

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.781
Hello. Lawrence Gill's office.
May I help you?

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.884
At 2:30 today.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.319
Hello, I'm here to see Mr. Gill.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.922
Yes, of course, one moment.

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:14.363
- Mr. Gill, a Mr....
- Stone.

01:03:14.463 --> 01:03:16.894
A Mr. Stone is here to see you.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:19.917
Yes, sir. You can go right in.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:34.244
Thank you for coming, Mr. Stone.
It's over here.

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:36.280
It's big, I know.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:39.849
They offered me 300 square
on the fifth floor or this down here.

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.319
Not a hard decision, right?

01:03:42.419 --> 01:03:45.495
Take the golf cart. That's what it's for.

01:04:02.706 --> 01:04:05.548
Watch out for the sunken meeting area.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:09.213
No, no, you can just go around those.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.920
No, don't try to drive through.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.829
There. There you are.

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.336
Have a seat.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:34.771
Do you like the fish?
I just had them put in.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.940
Salt water tanks.
They're hard to maintain.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.381
Those are leprechaun fish.
The ones with the sort of Irish faces.

01:04:41.481 --> 01:04:44.148
Is there some problem?

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:48.435
- No, sir. It's nothing like that.
- What then?

01:04:48.535 --> 01:04:51.621
- Nothing.
- Excuse me?

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.461
It's just...

01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:56.535
What?

01:04:56.635 --> 01:04:58.408
Well...

01:04:58.508 --> 01:05:00.698
Please, I have a conference to attend.

01:05:00.798 --> 01:05:03.934
Oh, yes, of course. "Customer Service."

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:09.273
And I've read your book myself.
Hotel productivity up 90%.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:12.910
You and I are in the same business,
really, when you come down to it.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:16.913
- Service. Wouldn't you agree?
- Yes.

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.016
Yes.

01:05:19.116 --> 01:05:22.753
Anyway, I don't know
how to put this, so I'll just put it.

01:05:22.853 --> 01:05:26.419
I understand that you had a guest
in your room last night.

01:05:26.519 --> 01:05:30.260
- Is that a crime?
- No, not at all.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.706
Certainly, hoteliers are in the business
of being discreet about our guests'...

01:05:33.806 --> 01:05:37.038
- philandering.
- Philandering?

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:42.102
No, it isn't that. My choice of words...
It's not about that at all.

01:05:42.202 --> 01:05:45.208
How do you even know that, anyway?

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.783
Well, I...

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:50.819
Mr. Stone, may I be candid with you?

01:05:50.919 --> 01:05:53.983
I guess. I don't know
what the hell you're getting at.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.658
Well, I...

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.362
I love you.

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:03.986
- Right, I'm leaving.
- No, no. Look.

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:07.464
I've never talked to you like this before.
It has not been appropriate.

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:11.134
Perhaps it's not still, but I've been unable
to contain myself this morning.

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:13.337
I love you.
And I want what's best for you.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:17.274
And if you need to have an affair,
I understand, but have it with me.

01:06:17.374 --> 01:06:18.876
Goodbye.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:23.619
Have it with anyone at all,
anybody, just not Lisa.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:29.453
No. Wait!

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:33.742
We're all here for you.
We're all one for you. Come back!

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:44.535
Do you like any of these here?
They're very pretty.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:47.871
That one's Stephanie.
Stephanie, say hello to Mr. Stone.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:51.746
Hello. You can fuck me
if you want, Mr. Stone.

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.978
Or me.

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:57.681
- Any of us.
- Just not Lisa.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:59.388
Not Lisa!

01:06:59.488 --> 01:07:01.289
Lisa.

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:10.627
Lisa!

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:13.268
Here's your breakfast, Mr. Stone.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.801
Lisa!

01:07:31.915 --> 01:07:35.690
Lisa! Lisa!

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.555
Yes? Oh, hello, Michael.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.490
Where...

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.739
- Where is she, Emily?
- She's not here.

01:07:42.839 --> 01:07:45.163
- Michael?
- Lisa, let's go!

01:07:45.263 --> 01:07:47.197
- What?
- Lisa, don't go with him. He's insane.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:48.198
What's going on?

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:50.600
I don't have the time to tell you.
Just come!

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.570
Where are you taking me?
Em, what's going on?

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:55.773
Oh, for God's sake.
Lisa, pull free from him and come back here.

01:07:55.873 --> 01:08:00.187
Where are you going to go, Michael?
Be reasonable. There's nowhere to go.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:04.119
- You're hurting me.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:15.192
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had to get you away. You weren't safe.

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:18.395
Safe from what?
What are you talking about?

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:22.899
They don't want us to be together.
I think they'll kill you if they need to.

01:08:22.999 --> 01:08:24.667
- Michael?
- They explained it to me.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:28.872
The hotel manager, he explained it to me.
They're all one person and they love me.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.774
Everyone is one person, but you and me.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.916
You're the only other person in the world!

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.486
Really?

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.122
That's so beautiful.

01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:45.738
- I'm going to cry.
- No.

01:08:45.839 --> 01:08:48.558
We need to stay together. Forever.

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:51.495
To protect each other,
to nurture each other.

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:55.398
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's...
Are you sure?

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.468
Yes.

01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:03.340
Yes. Finally. Finally, I've found you.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:06.943
I've waited so long for someone to...

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.746
- And you're so smart.
- We have to get out of here.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.731
- My clothes. My stuff.
- We'll get new.

01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:15.953
- Your wife and son.
- They don't exist. They're just them.

01:09:16.053 --> 01:09:18.350
Michael? Michael?

01:09:18.451 --> 01:09:22.397
Michael? Michael? Michael?

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:26.962
Michael! You're having
a nightmare or something.

01:09:27.063 --> 01:09:30.767
- Oh, man.
- You were thrashing.

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:33.890
- You hit me in the face with your elbow.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:39.413
Oh, it's okay. I kind of liked it.
It's kind of intimate.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.745
Oh, okay, then. Stick around.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:44.932
I'm sure you'll get more of those.
I'm a sloppy sleeper.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.924
You're all sweaty.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:52.754
- What was the dream?
- I don't know.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:57.899
Something about the hotel manager.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.671
Are you hungry? We could order breakfast.

01:10:07.771 --> 01:10:10.540
I have to get ready for this speech.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.477
- Can I have scrambled eggs?
- Sure.

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:18.214
I love eggs.
Scrambled is my favorite egg style.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.655
What about yours?

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:27.197
These eggs are delicious.
They're scrambled perfectly.

01:10:27.297 --> 01:10:30.660
- Do you want to try some?
- No. Now here's what I'm thinking.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.730
- Yes?
- I want to be with you.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.165
What do you mean?

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:39.202
I need to be with you.
I want to leave my wife.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:42.555
Really? Michael,
that's a big decision. I don't...

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:47.282
No, no, no, it's something I have to do.
I mean, if you're interested.

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:52.334
I mean, yeah. I mean, it's awfully sudden.
I mean, I don't...

01:10:52.434 --> 01:10:56.433
want to be responsible for breaking up
a marriage. Do we need to decide now?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:59.789
It's been years
since I've felt anything like this.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:02.668
It's like a floodgate has opened.
I can't close it. I don't want to.

01:11:02.768 --> 01:11:05.033
I love you.

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.497
Okay.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:10.767
I don't know. It seems so big and...

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:14.641
Oh, gosh, okay. Yeah, let's do it.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.575
Great! This is so great!

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:20.644
Anomalisa.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:24.882
So, I'll call Donna and tell her.

01:11:25.182 --> 01:11:29.352
- No, maybe I should go and see her, right?
- Yeah, that sounds right.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.789
- I think that's such an important...
- Could you not...

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:35.658
You're clicking your fork against
your teeth. Could you not do that?

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:38.395
Oh, sorry.
People have told me that before.

01:11:38.495 --> 01:11:42.966
- I know, it's a stupid unconscious habit.
- It's okay. Anyway, you were saying?

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.202
Just that I think it's more respectful.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:48.395
And you need to speak to Henry
and explain that this isn't about him.

01:11:48.495 --> 01:11:50.824
But it is. It's about him, too.

01:11:52.576 --> 01:11:55.028
Well, don't tell him that.
He's just a little boy.

01:11:55.128 --> 01:11:58.203
Yeah. You're right.

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:03.453
You're being a little controlling,
don't you think?

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:05.789
- I don't mean to. I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:07.391
Good. I'm glad...

01:12:07.491 --> 01:12:10.460
Please don't talk with food
hanging out of your mouth.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.931
- Oh, sorry. I'm a pig. Sorry.
- No. No, no, no. It's okay.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:18.101
So, will you live in Los Angeles,
or do you need to stay in Ohio?

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.943
I'm sorry. Hold on.

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:34.217
I can move to Los Angeles.
I could do that.

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:36.186
Good.

01:12:36.286 --> 01:12:39.989
We should go to the zoo today after
your speech. I hear it's really good.

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:44.228
They have breeding programs
for all these endangered species.

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:47.497
I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:50.867
They have breeding programs
for all these endangered species.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:55.338
So you get to see things like pandas,
which I think are awfully cute.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:59.109
They're not really bears, I read.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:00.718
Yeah.

01:13:00.818 --> 01:13:04.450
Sure. That sounds fine.

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:09.801
- What is it?
- Nothing. The zoo sounds good.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.530
My stomach hurts.
It feels empty. It's clenched.

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.700
Well, eat some more waffle maybe?

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:24.172
Did I do something wrong?

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.804
I'm sorry. Darling.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.978
It's okay.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.309
I'm anxious about my speech, I suppose.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:37.803
Of course. Well, we'll have fun after.
We don't have to go to the zoo.

01:13:37.903 --> 01:13:41.448
We can just hang out here. I have the whole
weekend till I have to get back to work.

01:13:41.548 --> 01:13:43.353
That's great.

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:45.755
I'm so happy, Michael.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:49.264
I've waited for someone
like you my whole life.

01:13:50.059 --> 01:13:52.467
I've waited, too.

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:56.097
- We'll work it all out, right?
- Yes.

01:13:56.197 --> 01:13:59.769
Who would've thunk it?
It's just so beautiful.

01:13:59.869 --> 01:14:02.105
Life can be.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:05.079
Things can work out. That's the lesson.

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:09.921
Sometimes there's no lesson.
That's a lesson in itself.

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:13.454
I guess so.

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:19.172
I feel anxious, Michael. I feel something.
Like you're different-acting.

01:14:19.272 --> 01:14:22.225
Me? No, no, no.
Everything's fine. I'm just...

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:24.261
I know.

01:14:24.361 --> 01:14:26.458
I'm not great to look at
in bright sunlight.

01:14:26.558 --> 01:14:29.332
No, you're very pretty.

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:31.267
Okay.

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:33.970
So, we could maybe go out for a walk

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:37.345
- and talk or something.
- Yes.

01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:41.115
- So I'll see you after?
- Of course.

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.054
And...

01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:52.841
Always remember,
the customer is an individual.

01:14:53.793 --> 01:14:56.078
Just like you.

01:14:56.430 --> 01:15:00.197
Each person you speak to has had a day.

01:15:00.297 --> 01:15:02.675
Some of their days have been good,

01:15:02.775 --> 01:15:06.274
some bad, but they've all had one.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:10.607
Each person you speak to
has had a childhood.

01:15:10.707 --> 01:15:13.209
Each has a body.

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:17.252
Each body has aches.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.752
What is it to be human?

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.226
What is it to ache?

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:30.631
What is it to be alive?

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.431
I don't know.

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:40.441
What is it to ache? I don't know.
What is it to be alive? I don't know.

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:47.677
Yes. "How do I talk to a customer?"
How do I talk to a customer?

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:51.681
These are the important questions
for a customer service representative.

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:55.251
What do I say?
Do I smile while I'm on the phone?

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:59.055
Well, they can tell if you're smiling
even if they can't see you.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:03.559
Did you know that? Try it as an experiment
on the phone with a friend.

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:06.500
Try it, go ahead. Watch.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.639
I'm lost.

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:18.213
You see, I was smiling when I said that.
I've lost my love.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:23.713
She's an unmoored ship drifting off
to sea. And I have no one to talk to.

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:28.222
I have no one to talk to.
I have no one to talk to.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:34.205
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to burden you with that.

01:16:34.305 --> 01:16:38.376
I just don't know
what else to do because...

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:41.769
I have no one to talk to.

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:48.919
Be friendly to the customer.
Think of the customer as a friend.

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:58.081
I want to cry, but I can't.

01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:00.583
Is it the Zoloft, Dr. Horowitz?

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:02.957
Is it the Zoloft?

01:17:11.528 --> 01:17:14.430
My face squeezes into that crying contortion
you all know so well

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:18.148
but nothing comes out. I need tears.

01:17:18.701 --> 01:17:21.642
It's like not being able to come.

01:17:23.173 --> 01:17:28.289
I need tears to tear me in two
and let this nightmare escape, but...

01:17:33.249 --> 01:17:36.546
Anyway, yes, don't forget to smile.
It makes a person's day.

01:17:36.646 --> 01:17:39.638
And what does it cost you?
A smile is free.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:44.461
This is not working. This is not working.
This is not working.

01:17:44.561 --> 01:17:47.463
The world is falling apart.

01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:50.066
The president is a war criminal.

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:56.459
America is going down the tubes and you're
talking about goddamn intelligent design.

01:17:56.559 --> 01:18:00.009
They've intentionally destroyed
the public education system

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:04.314
because it's easier to manipulate
dumb workers and soldiers.

01:18:04.414 --> 01:18:07.722
There's no need for that!
Support our troops!

01:18:13.923 --> 01:18:17.794
- I thought this was about customer service.
- Be personable.

01:18:17.894 --> 01:18:21.347
Remember to believe in yourself.
Believe in your company.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.822
And your products or services.

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:29.410
I sweat onto my pillow every night.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:33.714
I think there's something
very, very wrong with me.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.756
Be friendly.

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:48.257
Yes, what does it cost you? Look for
what is special about each individual.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:51.865
Focus on that during your conversation.

01:18:56.098 --> 01:19:00.536
Our time is limited. We forget that.

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:02.839
Death comes, that's it.

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:05.680
Soon it's as if we never existed.

01:19:06.609 --> 01:19:09.651
So, remember to smile.

01:19:11.948 --> 01:19:15.217
Remember there is someone
out there for everyone.

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:19.755
Someone to love. Remember every
person you speak to needs love.

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:22.129
Remember to...

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.437
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
- Slugger!

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:36.293
- What'd you bring me?
- In the bag.

01:19:36.393 --> 01:19:39.275
- Let me look! Let me look!
- He gets right to the point.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.061
- Hi, honey.
- Is this it?

01:19:41.161 --> 01:19:42.101
- Yup.
- What is it?

01:19:42.201 --> 01:19:45.601
- A toy.
- It's... it's a doll.

01:19:45.701 --> 01:19:48.785
- It's for girls. It's a girls' doll.
- No. It's a toy, an antique. It moves.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:52.567
- It's stupid, and the face is broken.
- It's an antique. That's part of its charm.

01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:55.091
I don't get it. I don't get it.
What are these words here?

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:58.795
I don't know. It's in Japanese.
Press some buttons. It moves.

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:01.497
- What else did you get me?
- I didn't get you anything else...

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:04.433
- Surprise!
- Jesus! That scared me!

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:06.535
Welcome home, honey.
It's a surprise party.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.505
I don't... Who are all these people?

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:13.202
- Michael, it's great to see you.
- Yeah. Oh, thanks. Who are they?

01:20:13.302 --> 01:20:15.544
- It's everybody, honey.
- What's it doing now, Daddy?

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.583
- I don't recognize any of them.
- Michael, how are you?

01:20:17.683 --> 01:20:19.937
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, how are you?
- Daddy, what's coming out of the toy?

01:20:20.037 --> 01:20:22.485
- I don't know.
- God, Michael, it looks like semen.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:25.087
I don't know. I just got it at a store.
I don't know.

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:26.455
What's semen, Mommy?

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:29.964
It's just a liquid, Henry.
It's just a liquid.

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:33.929
Michael, do you realize that we love you?

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:35.903
Henry.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:38.873
Me.

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:42.476
All of us here.

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:49.578
Who are you, Donna?

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.797
Who are you, really?

01:20:51.897 --> 01:20:54.316
Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:58.257
I'm sorry, Henry. Mommy said a bad word.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:00.823
But for fuck's sake, Michael.
I don't know who I am.

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:04.580
I mean, who are you? Who is anyone?

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:07.135
Who could answer that question?

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:12.986
I don't want you to leave.

01:21:13.086 --> 01:21:15.738
- Donna, I'm not leaving.
- Is Daddy leaving?

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:18.441
Of course not, slugger.

01:21:18.741 --> 01:21:20.657
Where would I go?

01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:28.489
- Donna?
- I'm sorry.

01:21:31.403 --> 01:21:34.140
Well, good to see you.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.832
Thanks very much.

01:21:39.003 --> 01:21:42.656
- Daddy, what's it doing now?
- Singing, slugger.

01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:48.004
Can I go out and play?

01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:52.838
Yeah, sure. I'll stay here
and listen to it till it's over.

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:22.868
<i>September 16th, 2005.</i>

01:22:23.572 --> 01:22:28.411
<i>Dear Michael, I'm sorry
to see you go, but I understand.</i>

01:22:28.511 --> 01:22:30.580
<i>Well, I don't understand, but I accept it.</i>

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.783
<i>I'm so glad we had this time together.</i>

01:22:33.883 --> 01:22:38.705
<i>I don't think I ever felt
love like this was.</i>

01:22:43.226 --> 01:22:46.763
<i>Maybe someday we'll meet again
under better circumstances.</i>

01:22:46.863 --> 01:22:51.906
<i>Love, Lisa "Anomalisa" Hesselman.</i>

01:22:58.007 --> 01:22:59.776
<i>P.S.</i>

01:22:59.876 --> 01:23:03.179
<i>I looked up "Anomarisa"
in my Japanese-English dictionary.</i>

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:07.280
<i>It turns out it means "Goddess of Heaven."</i>

01:23:08.785 --> 01:23:11.926
<i>Not that I think of myself
that way, of course.</i>

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.864
<i>It's just interesting.</i>

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.411
<i># When I see a face</i>

01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:55.982
<i># Or hear a name</i>

01:23:56.082 --> 01:24:00.820
<i># Or am introduced to someone new</i>

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:07.164
<i># It doesn't matter, they're all the same</i>

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:11.530
<i># And none of them is you</i>

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:14.700
<i># When I go to work</i>

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.037
<i># Or take a walk</i>

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:23.175
<i># And watch what other people do</i>

01:24:23.275 --> 01:24:29.153
<i># I'll listen to their idle talk</i>

01:24:30.082 --> 01:24:34.486
<i># And none of them is you</i>

01:24:34.586 --> 01:24:37.256
<i># Where are you</i>

01:24:37.356 --> 01:24:40.092
<i># My dear?</i>

01:24:40.192 --> 01:24:45.131
<i># Why can't I hear you?</i>

01:24:45.231 --> 01:24:51.670
<i># How I wish that you were here</i>

01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:54.440
<i># How I long</i>

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:57.910
<i># To be near</i>

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:00.575
<i># You</i>

01:25:04.616 --> 01:25:07.353
<i># Sometimes at night</i>

01:25:07.453 --> 01:25:11.128
<i># I'll pass the time</i>

01:25:11.657 --> 01:25:16.128
<i># Those endless, sleepless hours in bed</i>

01:25:16.228 --> 01:25:22.172
<i># I'll try to reconstruct your voice</i>

01:25:23.169 --> 01:25:27.273
<i># But only hear their voice instead</i>

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:29.775
<i># They talk, they yell</i>

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.945
<i># In that other voice</i>

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:38.551
<i># They flirt and whisper, too</i>

01:25:38.651 --> 01:25:44.728
<i># I'd love them if I had the choice</i>

01:25:45.424 --> 01:25:49.928
<i># But none of them is you</i>

01:25:50.028 --> 01:25:52.598
<i># Where are you</i>

01:25:52.698 --> 01:25:55.667
<i># My dear?</i>

01:25:55.767 --> 01:26:00.506
<i># Why can't I hear you?</i>

01:26:00.606 --> 01:26:03.909
<i># How I wish that you</i>

01:26:04.009 --> 01:26:07.045
<i># Were here</i>

01:26:07.145 --> 01:26:09.648
<i># How I long</i>

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:13.452
<i># To be near</i>

01:26:13.552 --> 01:26:15.610
<i># You</i>

01:26:20.192 --> 01:26:23.161
<i># In a dream you came</i>

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.964
<i># And held my hand</i>

01:26:26.064 --> 01:26:29.067
<i># Our love was perfect</i>

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:31.570
<i># In that sphere</i>

01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:37.648
<i># The breeze was your whisper in that land</i>

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:42.615
<i># While the air stands still right here</i>

01:26:42.715 --> 01:26:48.887
<i># No, I've never met you, my sweet dear</i>

01:26:48.987 --> 01:26:53.859
<i># And my friends, they say you don't exist</i>

01:26:53.959 --> 01:27:00.203
<i># But friends are cowards full of fear</i>

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.070
<i># Afraid to look at what they've missed</i>

01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:11.281
<i># One day I'll be walking on the street</i>

01:27:11.744 --> 01:27:16.148
<i># That crowded, bustling, faceless spread</i>

01:27:16.248 --> 01:27:22.259
<i># I'll turn the corner and we'll meet</i>

01:27:23.255 --> 01:27:28.027
<i># And I will be no longer dead</i>

01:27:28.627 --> 01:27:33.871
<i># And I will be no longer dead</i>

01:27:35.967 --> 01:27:38.504
<i># Where are you</i>

01:27:38.604 --> 01:27:41.607
<i># My dear?</i>

01:27:41.707 --> 01:27:46.212
<i># Why can't I hear you?</i>

01:27:46.612 --> 01:27:53.018
<i># How I wish that you were here</i>

01:27:53.118 --> 01:27:55.687
<i># How I long</i>

01:27:56.087 --> 01:27:59.825
<i># To be near</i>

01:27:59.925 --> 01:28:01.981
<i># You #</i>
