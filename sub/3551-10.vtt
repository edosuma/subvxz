WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.273
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.273 --> 00:04.705
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THIS GREAT GUY FROM MY PAST.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.438
AN EVENING OF DRINKING
LED TO A CONFESSION.

00:07.438 --> 00:09.610
(yawns) TOM.
 (whispers) TOM SCAVO?

00:09.610 --> 00:11.442
(yawns) LOVE OF MY LIFE.

00:11.442 --> 00:14.185
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:14.185 --> 00:16.447
DID ANYONE ORDER
A SHRIMP COCKTAIL

00:16.447 --> 00:19.150
WITH A PUNY ENGAGEMENT RING
ON THE SIDE?

00:19.150 --> 00:21.552
KEITH'S PLAN TO PROPOSE
WAS THWARTED.

00:21.552 --> 00:24.295
I REALLY DO LOVE YOUR SON.

00:24.295 --> 00:27.158
YEAH, I SEE YOU WITH SOMEONE...
MORE YOUR OWN AGE.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.560
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 MEMORIZING YOUR FACE.

00:29.560 --> 00:34.034
GABY SAID GOOD-BYE TO
HER BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER GRACE.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.707
A HALFWAY HOUSE FOR CONVICTS
ON OUR STREET?

00:36.707 --> 00:39.039
I NOW OWN SEVEN HOUSES
ON WISTERIA LANE.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.143
AND PAUL NEEDED
ONE MORE HOUSE...

00:42.143 --> 00:44.245
I CAN OFFER YOU
WELL ABOVE MARKET VALUE.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.718
HOW MUCH ABOVE MARKET VALUE?
 WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.580
TO ACHIEVE HIS GOAL.

00:56.527 --> 01:00.060
(Mary Alice)
WE KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

01:01.762 --> 01:05.196
WE KNOW HOW THEY DRESS...

01:05.196 --> 01:09.640
AND WE KNOW HOW THEY BEHAVE.

01:11.542 --> 01:17.178
YES, WE CAN ALL RECOGNIZE
THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.510
AND WHEN WE SEE THEM COMING,

01:19.510 --> 01:22.253
WE DO WHAT WE HAVE TO
TO PROTECT OURSELVES.

01:22.253 --> 01:23.554
LYNETTE!

01:23.554 --> 01:25.556
HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE DAY?

01:25.556 --> 01:27.288
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

01:27.288 --> 01:29.620
OLD FRIENDS.
 EX-CON FRIENDS?

01:29.620 --> 01:31.862
MM.
 UH... AREN'T YOU JUMPING
THE GUN?

01:31.862 --> 01:33.694
UNTIL THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION
VOTES,

01:33.694 --> 01:35.696
YOU DON'T HAVE APPROVAL
FOR YOUR PROJECT.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.629
THESE MEN HAVE VOLUNTEERED
TO GET MY HALFWAY HOUSE READY.

01:38.629 --> 01:41.872
MOST OF THEM LIVE IN A DREADFUL
FACILITY ON SKID ROW.

01:41.872 --> 01:44.575
I TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY
PARTICIPATED IN THE REMODEL,

01:44.575 --> 01:46.577
I COULD GET THEM
TRANSFERRED HERE.

01:46.577 --> 01:48.179
YOU'RE WASTING THEIR TIME,

01:48.179 --> 01:50.881
BECAUSE THIS PLACE
IS NEVER GOING TO OPEN.

01:50.881 --> 01:54.185
OH, I THINK IT WILL.

01:54.185 --> 01:57.188
AND WON'T IT BE NICE FOR
THESE MEN TO LIVE ON A STREET

01:57.188 --> 01:59.350
WHERE CHILDREN PLAY
IN THEIR FRONT YARDS

01:59.350 --> 02:02.623
AND PEOPLE DON'T LOCK
THEIR DOORS AT NIGHT?

02:06.857 --> 02:09.560
WHY IS PAUL SO SURE
THE HOUSE WILL OPEN?

02:09.560 --> 02:11.562
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES.

02:11.562 --> 02:14.465
HE'S GOT SOMETHING UP HIS
SLEEVE. WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW.

02:14.465 --> 02:16.467
ARE WE POSITIVE
NO ONE'S PLANNING ON

02:16.467 --> 02:17.768
SELLING HIM THEIR HOME?

02:17.768 --> 02:19.770
WE CAN'T TAKE ANYONE
FOR GRANTED.

02:19.770 --> 02:21.872
WE NEED TO TALK
TO EVERYONE ON THE STREET.

02:21.872 --> 02:24.345
GOOD IDEA.
WE'LL SHORE UP SUPPORT.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.218
AND IF WE SENSE ANYONE
STARTING TO WAVER...
 HOW COULD THEY?

02:27.218 --> 02:29.380
EVERYONE KNOWS
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.382
I PRAY THEY DO.

02:31.382 --> 02:33.854
I LOVE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
AND I DON'T WANT IT TO CHANGE.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.826
LET'S GO.

02:35.826 --> 02:38.389
AND WITH THAT,

02:38.389 --> 02:42.793
MY FRIENDS WENT TO WORK
TRYING TO STOP PAUL YOUNG.

02:42.793 --> 02:46.737
HE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE UP TO.

02:46.737 --> 02:50.801
BUT HE DIDN'T CARE.

02:50.801 --> 02:53.844
HE SHOULD HAVE.

02:53.844 --> 02:56.547
PAUL HAD FORGOTTEN
WHAT ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN

02:56.547 --> 02:59.850
WILL DO
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES...

02:59.850 --> 03:15.796
FROM THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE.

03:15.796 --> 03:21.272
IT WAS JUST BEFORE SUNRISE
ON WISTERIA LANE...

03:21.272 --> 03:24.235
WHEN A CAB ARRIVED...

03:24.235 --> 03:28.639
AND A WOMAN DEPARTED.

03:28.639 --> 03:32.313
SHE LEFT THE STREET QUIETLY.

03:32.313 --> 03:36.647
BUT NEWS OF HER DISAPPEARANCE
WOULD SOON SPREAD.

03:36.647 --> 03:41.422
AND THE SOUND
WOULD BE DEAFENING.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.759
BUT FIRST...

03:48.759 --> 03:52.703
A YOUNG MAN IN LOVE

03:52.703 --> 03:58.238
HAD PLANS TO MAKE SOME NOISE
OF HIS OWN.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.810
(door squeaks)

04:06.246 --> 04:09.249
(panting) BREE, I LOVE YOU,
AND I WANT THIS TO BE

04:09.249 --> 04:12.252
THE LAST MORNING YOU WAKE UP
WITHOUT ME NEXT TO YOU.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.756
IT'S 6:00! HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN KNEELING THERE?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.458
I DON'T KNOW,

04:17.458 --> 04:19.630
BUT AFTER YOU ANSWER
THIS QUESTION,

04:19.630 --> 04:22.262
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO HELP ME UP.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.595
BREE...

04:24.595 --> 04:26.497
WILL YOU DO ME THE HONOR...

04:26.497 --> 04:28.639
MAY I SAY SOMETHING FIRST?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.643
AFTER THAT EMBARRASSING NIGHT
IN THE RESTAURANT,

04:32.643 --> 04:35.676
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING
ANOTHER STAB AT THIS, BUT...

04:37.908 --> 04:39.780
THAT'S A LONG "BUT."
I'M GETTING UP.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.653
HOLD ON.
I'M NOT SAYING NO...

04:42.653 --> 04:44.855
EXACTLY.

04:44.855 --> 04:48.319
IT'S JUST SO SOON TO BE
TALKING ABOUT MARRIAGE.

04:48.319 --> 04:52.593
MAYBE I CAN USE THIS
AS A TINY NAPKIN RING.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.725
WAIT!

04:58.399 --> 05:00.601
I HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR YOU.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.535
I LOVE YOU, TOO,

05:04.535 --> 05:06.637
KEITH WATSON,

05:06.637 --> 05:10.381
AND I ALSO WANT THIS TO BE
THE LAST MORNING I WAKE UP

05:10.381 --> 05:13.083
WITHOUT YOU NEXT TO ME.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.516
SO I'M ASKING YOU,

05:15.516 --> 05:18.949
WILL YOU DO ME
THE HONOR OF...

05:20.551 --> 05:24.355
MOVING IN WITH ME?

05:24.355 --> 05:26.597
(chuckles)

05:26.597 --> 05:28.098
FOR THE THIRD TIME, NO.

05:28.098 --> 05:30.631
I'M NOT GONNA SELL
MY HOUSE TO PAUL YOUNG.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.564
I'M SORRY. I JUST HAD TO
MAKE SURE. THE VOTE IS TODAY.

05:33.564 --> 05:36.567
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
I WOULD LET DANGEROUS EX-CONS

05:36.567 --> 05:38.709
MOVE IN
NEXT TO MY OWN MOTHER?

05:38.709 --> 05:42.042
I DON'T KNOW. AS A TEENAGER,
YOU WERE PRETTY NASTY.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.546
BUT YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP NOW
AND SO VERY NICE.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.479
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

05:48.479 --> 05:50.551
EXCUSE ME.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.052
LYNETTE SCAVO?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.554
YEAH?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.055
BRENT FERGUSON, PRESIDENT

05:55.055 --> 05:57.027
OF THE HYDRANGEA CIRCLE
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION.

05:57.027 --> 05:58.559
OHH.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.631
WE'VE ALL HEARD
ABOUT YOUR SITUATION.

06:00.631 --> 06:02.132
WE'D LOVE TO HELP.

06:02.132 --> 06:05.596
REALLY?
 SURE. LAST YEAR WE HAD
A SIMILAR SCARE ON OUR STREET.

06:05.596 --> 06:08.499
SOME OLD HIPPIE WANTED
TO OPEN UP A DRUG REHAB CENTER

06:08.499 --> 06:10.501
ON OUR BLOCK.
 I REMEMBER.

06:10.501 --> 06:13.504
DIDN'T THAT OLD HIPPIE
GET BEAT UP BY A NEIGHBOR?

06:13.504 --> 06:15.806
(laughs) HE MADE THE MISTAKE
OF MOUTHING OFF

06:15.806 --> 06:18.509
TO ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS
WHO'S AN EX-GREEN BERET.

06:18.509 --> 06:21.512
NEWSPAPER MADE IT SOUND
WAY WORSE THAN IT WAS.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.514
WELL, NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.015
YOU SAY THE WORD,

06:25.015 --> 06:27.017
AND I WILL HAVE
THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

06:27.017 --> 06:29.520
OF TEN DIFFERENT STREETS
HERE TO BACK YOU FOLKS UP.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.663
WHOEVER'S TRYING TO OPEN UP
THIS HALFWAY HOUSE,

06:32.663 --> 06:36.627
WE COULD REALLY SCARE
THE HELL OUT OF 'EM.
 WELL, I APPRECIATE YOUR OFFER,

06:36.627 --> 06:39.129
BUT I THINK WE'D PREFER
TO HANDLE OUR SITUATION

06:39.129 --> 06:40.801
IN A MORE... (sighs)

06:40.801 --> 06:43.504
CIVILIZED MANNER.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.075
OKAY. WELL,

06:45.075 --> 06:48.078
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.810
"HYDRANGEA CIRCLE,"
GOT IT.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.116
SO WE'RE AT DINNER, AND RENEE IS
GOING ON AND ON ABOUT THIS GUY

06:56.116 --> 06:59.119
SHE ONCE HAD A FLING WITH
AND SHE STILL HAS FEELINGS FOR,

06:59.119 --> 07:03.624
AND SHE GETS SO DRUNK THAT
SHE TELLS ME IT WAS TOM SCAVO.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.126
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THAT?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.799
You look so hot right now.

07:08.799 --> 07:13.504
MIKE, FOCUS. I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN IN ALASKA FOR A MONTH.

07:13.504 --> 07:16.467
A month, 19 days,
and 7 hours.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.969
Yesterday I put boobs
on a snowman.

07:18.969 --> 07:20.671
I need to come home.

07:20.671 --> 07:22.813
I MISS YOU, TOO.

07:22.813 --> 07:25.516
SO AM I MAKING
TOO MUCH OUT OF THIS?

07:25.516 --> 07:27.518
I MEAN, IT HAPPENED
20 YEARS AGO,

07:27.518 --> 07:29.520
AND TOM'S A GOOD GUY, RIGHT?

07:29.520 --> 07:30.821
Yeah, he is, but...

07:30.821 --> 07:34.084
EVEN GOOD GUYS MAKE MISTAKES
IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE RIGHT.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.187
Interesting point.
Wish you hadn't made it

07:37.187 --> 07:39.890
while you were 2,000 miles away
and clearly horny.

07:39.890 --> 07:43.894
(laughs) SUSAN, I AM
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

07:43.894 --> 07:46.597
THE ONLY FEMALE I'VE SEEN
HAS ANTLERS.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.671
SO SHOULD I TELL LYNETTE?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.242
Well, not just yet.

07:52.242 --> 07:54.775
MAYBE JUST KEEP AN EYE
ON THE SITUATION.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.206
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

07:56.206 --> 07:58.909
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU COME HOME,

07:58.909 --> 08:02.983
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU FORGET
ALL ABOUT THAT SNOWMAN.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.055
Her name is Carol.

08:05.055 --> 08:09.159
OKAY, YOU REALLY
NEED TO COME HOME.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.197
(sniffles)

08:17.197 --> 08:19.770
MOMMY?

08:19.770 --> 08:21.271
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

08:23.534 --> 08:25.776
OH... JUST...

08:25.776 --> 08:28.278
HAVING A SAD DAY.

08:28.278 --> 08:32.582
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF SAD
DAYS. IS IT BECAUSE GRACE LEFT?

08:32.582 --> 08:35.245
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
(sniffles)

08:35.245 --> 08:40.120
THAT WAS WHEN YOU STARTED BEING
SAD--THE DAY SHE WENT AWAY.

08:42.192 --> 08:44.193
NO, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW...

08:44.193 --> 08:47.197
I GOT REALLY CLOSE
TO THAT WHOLE FAMILY, AND...

08:47.197 --> 08:50.260
I KNEW I WAS GONNA MISS
CARMEN AND HECTOR.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.603
AND GRACE?

08:54.665 --> 08:56.266
(sighs)

08:56.266 --> 08:58.268
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
MY NECKLACE?

08:58.268 --> 09:00.741
I'M PLAYING DRESS-UP.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.944
NOT WITH REAL DIAMONDS.
HAND IT OVER!

09:03.944 --> 09:06.276
FINE. HERE.

09:06.276 --> 09:09.149
TAKE IT. JEESH.
 (jewels tinkle)

09:09.149 --> 09:12.923
AND I DON'T WANT YOU PLAYING IN
MY ROOM ANYMORE. YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:12.923 --> 09:16.887
I LIKED YOU BETTER
WHEN YOU WERE CRYING.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.094
MITZI!

09:24.094 --> 09:26.166
IT'S LYNETTE SCAVO!

09:26.166 --> 09:27.668
IF YOU'RE IN THERE,

09:27.668 --> 09:29.169
PLEASE OPEN UP!

09:29.169 --> 09:31.041
(vehicle approaches)

09:31.041 --> 09:33.273
(sighs)

09:35.345 --> 09:38.849
(car door slams)

09:38.849 --> 09:40.150
HEY, LEE.
 HEY.

09:40.150 --> 09:42.783
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHERE MITZI KINSKY IS,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.184
WOULD YOU?
 NO. WHY WOULD I?

09:44.184 --> 09:47.187
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU AND PAUL
CONVINCED HER TO SELL HER HOUSE

09:47.187 --> 09:50.160
AND THEN STASHED HER AWAY
SOMEPLACE FOR SAFEKEEPING.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.023
LYNETTE, I HAVE TO SAY,
I'M OFFENDED.
 I HAVE TO SAY,
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

09:53.023 --> 09:54.294
YOU KNOW...

09:54.294 --> 09:58.268
FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME,
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS UP TO!

09:58.268 --> 10:01.271
YOU WERE HIS REAL ESTATE AGENT!
YOU DIDN'T THINK IT ODD--

10:01.271 --> 10:04.705
HIM BUYING ALL THESE HOUSES
ON ONE STREET?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.738
HE WAS PAYING ME COMMISSIONS.
WHAT--WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:07.738 --> 10:09.740
COMPLAIN?
 MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

10:09.740 --> 10:12.743
AND IF PAUL IS VOTED DOWN
AT TONIGHT'S MEETING, I'M SURE

10:12.743 --> 10:15.115
IN TIME PEOPLE WILL FORGET YOU
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS--

10:15.115 --> 10:18.118
I--
 BUT, LEE, IF HE FINDS
A WAY TO OPEN THAT HOUSE,

10:18.118 --> 10:21.151
I DON'T THINK ANYONE ON THIS
STREET WILL EVER FORGIVE YOU.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.133
(cell phone rings)

10:33.133 --> 10:34.634
HELLO?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.036
Look out your window.

10:39.970 --> 10:42.072
Oh, it's you.
I'm hanging up now.

10:42.072 --> 10:44.775
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE ANNOYED WITH ME.

10:44.775 --> 10:47.317
I FEEL AWFUL.
 WELL, YOU SHOULD.

10:47.317 --> 10:50.020
BECAUSE OF YOU, EVERYONE
ON THIS STREET HATES ME NOW.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.321
THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING.

10:51.321 --> 10:54.855
I PUT YOU IN AN AWFUL POSITION.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.087
AND HOW ARE YOU GONNA
DO THAT?

10:57.087 --> 10:59.860
WELL, FIRST, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT MITZI KINSKY

10:59.860 --> 11:02.392
AGREED TO SELL ME
HER HOUSE YESTERDAY.

11:02.392 --> 11:04.064
WHAT?

11:04.064 --> 11:06.266
I suggested she leave
the lane for a while.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.969
The taxi picked her up
this morning.

11:08.969 --> 11:12.072
OH, MY GOD. SO WHY--
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.374
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LITTLE PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.377
AND GIVEN HOW THE NEIGHBORS
FEEL ABOUT YOU THESE DAYS,

11:17.377 --> 11:20.180
I SUGGEST YOU LISTEN.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.265
HEY, MITZI, IT'S LYNETTE. UM,
STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU.

11:35.265 --> 11:38.268
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE

11:38.268 --> 11:42.002
FOR TONIGHT'S MEETING.
CALL ME BACK. AY. HEY.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.475
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY BUSY. I
REALLY NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

11:45.475 --> 11:47.477
I WOULD LOVE TO,
BUT THE MEETING'S TONIGHT.

11:47.477 --> 11:49.709
I GOT A BUNCH
OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.843
CAN'T YOU TALK
TO SUSAN OR BREE?
 NO. IT'S GOTTA BE YOU.

11:52.843 --> 11:54.284
(chuckles) WHY?

11:54.284 --> 11:58.148
YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN I KNOW
WHO'S LOST A CHILD.

12:02.853 --> 12:05.155
AND EVER SINCE GRACE LEFT,
I CAN'T STOP CRYING.

12:05.155 --> 12:07.858
I BREAK DOWN AT THE MALL,
AT THE MARKET.

12:07.858 --> 12:09.930
I'M STARTING
TO FREAK MYSELF OUT.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.933
I WAS THE SAME WAY
AFTER I LOST THE BABY.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.965
I FINALLY WENT
TO A THERAPIST.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.967
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
 YEAH.

12:16.967 --> 12:20.911
DID IT HELP?
 IT DID.

12:20.911 --> 12:24.514
IN FACT, SHE HAD ME DO SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY.

12:24.514 --> 12:27.377
(Lynette)
WRITE GRACE A LETTER.

12:27.377 --> 12:29.079
(Gabrielle) A LETTER?

12:29.079 --> 12:30.380
YOU DON'T SEND IT.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.353
YOU JUST POUR OUT
YOUR FEELINGS.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.356
TELL GRACE HOW HAPPY YOU ARE
TO HAVE FOUND HER

12:36.356 --> 12:38.388
AND HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HER.

12:38.388 --> 12:40.090
TRUST ME.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.392
AFTER YOU'VE WRITTEN IT,
YOU'LL FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

12:42.392 --> 12:44.494
(sighs)

12:46.997 --> 12:48.498
(gasps)

12:48.498 --> 12:51.001
(Carlos, in distance)
GABY! WHERE ARE MY KEYS?

12:51.001 --> 12:52.903
UH, I HAVE THEM!

12:52.903 --> 12:54.905
WAIT. I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN!

12:54.905 --> 12:58.048
(sniffles, sighs)

13:00.450 --> 13:03.954
(sniffles, sighs)

13:31.081 --> 13:32.382
YOU'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER?

13:32.382 --> 13:35.085
(sighs) NO ONE'S
MORE SURPRISED THAN I AM.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.087
SO YOU DID PROPOSE TO HER?

13:37.087 --> 13:39.950
I TRIED. (sighs) BREE SAID
SHE'S NOT READY FOR THAT YET.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.952
THIS WAS THE COMPROMISE.

13:41.952 --> 13:45.395
I FIGURE WE'LL DO THIS FOR
A WHILE, THEN IN A COUPLE MONTHS

13:45.395 --> 13:47.297
WE'LL START TALKING
ABOUT A WEDDING.

13:47.297 --> 13:49.399
YEAH, I-I GUESS
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.301
(chuckles) YOU "GUESS"?

13:51.301 --> 13:53.303
IT'S JUST...

13:55.305 --> 13:58.308
IF BREE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU,
SEEMS SHE'D WANT TO...

13:58.308 --> 14:00.210
LOCK IT DOWN. THAT'S ALL.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.212
DAD, I GET WHERE
SHE'S COMING FROM.

14:02.212 --> 14:04.214
SHE JUST DIVORCED A GUY.

14:04.214 --> 14:06.016
THAT'S MY POINT.

14:06.016 --> 14:09.219
SHE'S READY FOR SOME FUN,
NOT SOMETHING SERIOUS.

14:09.219 --> 14:12.552
SHE MAY BE LOOKING AT YOU
AS A DIVERSION.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.055
NO, BREE LOVES ME.
THIS IS GOING SOMEWHERE.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.387
JUST MAKE SURE.

14:17.387 --> 14:20.030
IF BREE'S NOT WILLING TO MAKE
SOME SORT OF A COMMITMENT,

14:20.030 --> 14:23.163
THEN MAYBE--
 DAD, YOU'RE STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.235
I HOPE I'M WRONG.
I REALLY DO.

14:25.235 --> 14:27.397
AND IF I AM...

14:27.397 --> 14:32.202
YOU LET ME KNOW WHEN TO RENT
THE TUX FOR THE WEDDING.

14:35.906 --> 14:38.909
(indistinct conversations)

14:42.953 --> 14:44.354
OKAY.

14:44.354 --> 14:46.656
ANY SIGN OF MITZI?
 OH, NOT YET.

14:46.656 --> 14:48.358
GOD, WHERE COULD SHE BE?

14:48.358 --> 14:51.361
IF SHE SOLD HER HOUSE TO PAUL,
SHE BETTER BE ON THE RUN.

14:51.361 --> 14:53.363
NOT THAT IT'LL DO ANY GOOD.

14:53.363 --> 14:55.425
I'LL STILL HUNT HER DOWN
AND KILL HER.
 UH-HUH.

14:55.425 --> 14:59.669
(door closes)
 LYNETTE? WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR 20 MINUTES.

14:59.669 --> 15:04.334
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME YOU STARTED?
 RELAX, PAUL. WE'RE NOT TAKING
THE VOTE UNTIL EVERYONE'S HERE.

15:04.334 --> 15:07.007
WELL, WHILE WE'RE WAITING,
MAY I MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT?

15:07.007 --> 15:10.040
I SUPPOSE.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.383
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

15:13.383 --> 15:15.685
(clears throat)

15:15.685 --> 15:17.687
I WANTED YOU ALL TO KNOW

15:17.687 --> 15:20.690
THAT THE MAYOR OF FAIRVIEW
WILL BE HERE FRIDAY

15:20.690 --> 15:23.693
TO PRESENT ME WITH AN AWARD
FOR OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVICE.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.957
WHAT?
 WHAT?

15:26.957 --> 15:29.459
YES, IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S SORT OF A BIG DEAL,

15:29.459 --> 15:32.232
AND I WOULD LOVE IT IF
ALL OF MY FRIENDS WOULD ATTEND.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.135
IF YOU'D INVITE YOUR ENEMIES,
YOU'D GET A BIGGER CROWD.
 (laughter)

15:35.135 --> 15:38.638
AH, I LOVE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR,
MRS. McCLUSKEY.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.012
HOW WE'LL ALL MISS IT
AFTER YOU'RE GONE.
 HMM.

15:42.012 --> 15:45.675
HOLD IT. NOW, WHAT KIND OF
PUBLIC SERVICE DID YOU DO?

15:45.675 --> 15:47.677
THE HALFWAY HOUSE, OF COURSE.

15:47.677 --> 15:50.380
OH, SHOOT.
DID--DID I BURY THE LEAD?

15:50.380 --> 15:53.423
I NOW HAVE ALL THE VOTES
I NEED TO OPEN IT.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.687
HOW DO YOU HAVE THE VOTES?

15:57.687 --> 16:01.231
SOMEONE SOLD YOU THEIR HOUSE?

16:01.231 --> 16:03.733
OH, YES.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.235
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE SOLD.

16:05.235 --> 16:07.237
WE SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE UNDER

16:07.237 --> 16:09.239
WITH THE REST
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:09.239 --> 16:12.272
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
VERY NOBLE AND VERY STUPID.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.274
MITZI SOLD.
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE AROUND

16:14.274 --> 16:16.276
FOR EVERYBODY ON THIS STREET
TO PUMMEL,

16:16.276 --> 16:19.279
WHICH MEANS THEY WOULD HAVE
TAKEN THEIR ANGER OUT ON YOU.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.580
DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.582
(brakes squeal, car doors slam)

16:22.582 --> 16:24.584
WHAT THE HELL?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.486
(crickets chirping)

16:26.486 --> 16:29.219
MITZI, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:29.219 --> 16:31.521
(cab departs)
 I LIVE HERE. OH, I GUESS
YOU WOULD HAVE NOTICED,

16:31.521 --> 16:34.294
IF I WAS A HOT GUY WITH ABS.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.366
BUT WE THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.368
WEIRDEST THING.
GET THIS CALL?

16:38.368 --> 16:41.531
THIS GUY SAYS HE HAS
A JOB FOR ME IN THE CITY.

16:41.531 --> 16:44.534
PUTS ME UP IN A NICE HOTEL,
AND THEN HE NEVER SHOWED.

16:44.534 --> 16:47.637
HUH, AND I GOT STUCK
WITH THE MINIBAR CHARGES.

16:47.637 --> 16:50.510
SO, WAIT. YOU DIDN'T
 SELL YOUR HOUSE TO PAUL YOUNG?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.212
WHAT? (scoffs)

16:52.212 --> 16:55.785
PLEASE. I'M NOT GONNA
SCREW OVER MY NEIGHBORS.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.292
(footsteps approach)

17:02.292 --> 17:03.753
(Lynette) LEE?

17:03.753 --> 17:07.057
WHAT THE HELL
HAVE YOU DONE TO US?

17:19.509 --> 17:21.741
(doorbell ringing)
 NO, I'M SORRY.
LYNETTE IS NOT HERE.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.444
SHE'S TRYING TO DEAL WITH
THIS WHOLE PAUL YOUNG MESS.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.746
(doorbell rings)
 YES, I WILL HAVE HER
GET BACK TO YOU.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.479
OK-OKAY.
 (beep)

17:29.479 --> 17:31.481
WHAT IS HAPPENING
TO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

17:31.481 --> 17:33.483
SOME VAN JUST PULLED UP,

17:33.483 --> 17:36.586
AND THESE CREEPY CHARACTERS
ARE GETTING OUT.

17:36.586 --> 17:39.689
THAT IS A SCHOOL BUS, RENEE.
THOSE ARE CHILDREN.

17:39.689 --> 17:42.692
WELL, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME.

17:42.692 --> 17:45.695
CAN YOU COME OVER AND INSTALL
A DEAD BOLT ON MY DOOR?

17:45.695 --> 17:47.697
SURE.
I WILL BE RIGHT OVER,

17:47.697 --> 17:50.400
AS SOON AS I FIND WHERE
LYNETTE KEEPS THE TOOLBOX.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.702
GREAT.
I HAVE TO JUMP IN THE SHOWER.

17:52.702 --> 17:56.176
I WILL LEAVE THE KEY
UNDER THE MAT.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.083
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO USE
THAT KEY THE OTHER NIGHT.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.585
YEAH?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.718
YEAH. WE WENT OUT,
AND RENEE GOT HAMMERED,

18:08.718 --> 18:12.222
SO I HAD TO TAKE HER IN
AND PUT HER TO BED.

18:12.222 --> 18:14.364
WELL, THAT WAS NICE OF YOU.

18:14.364 --> 18:15.665
YEAH...

18:15.665 --> 18:18.368
AND SHE TOLD ME
THIS FASCINATING STORY

18:18.368 --> 18:21.501
ABOUT THIS GUY THAT SHE HAD
A FLING WITH 20 YEARS AGO.

18:21.501 --> 18:25.175
W-W-WHY--WHY--WHY
WAS THAT FASCINATING?

18:27.237 --> 18:29.539
WELL, APPARENTLY THE ONE
WEEKEND THEY SPENT TOGETHER

18:29.539 --> 18:31.681
MADE QUITE AN IMPACT ON HER.

18:31.681 --> 18:33.383
(chuckles nervously)

18:33.383 --> 18:36.546
W--DID SHE SAY ANY... THING...
 (splash)

18:36.546 --> 18:39.249
ELSE A-ABOUT THAT GUY?

18:39.249 --> 18:40.750
NO, NOT REALLY.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.393
HMM.

18:43.393 --> 18:46.456
ONLY THAT HIS NAME
WAS TOM SCAVO.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.731
OKAY, LOOK...
(breathes deeply)

18:51.731 --> 18:55.505
THIS HAPPENED BEFORE
 LYNETTE AND I WERE MARRIED.

18:55.505 --> 18:57.607
IT MEANT NOTHING.

18:57.607 --> 19:00.470
WELL, IT MEANT
SOMETHING TO RENEE.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.512
SHE'S STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:02.512 --> 19:06.516
SHE SAID THAT?
 SHE SLURRED IT.

19:06.516 --> 19:09.219
LOOK, THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING I WANTED TO KNOW,

19:09.219 --> 19:12.452
BUT NOW THAT I DO,
I AM IN A HORRIBLE POSITION.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.754
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T TELL LYNETTE!

19:14.754 --> 19:17.687
SH-SHE WOULD FREAK OUT!
 I DON'T WANT TO TELL HER,
BUT SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,

19:17.687 --> 19:20.390
AND I'M FREAKING OUT
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE AT RENEE'S

19:20.390 --> 19:22.692
FIXING HER DEAD BOLT
WHILE SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

19:22.692 --> 19:24.694
LOOK, THIS WAS FOREVER AGO,

19:24.694 --> 19:27.467
AND I DON'T FEEL
 ANYTHING FOR HER.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.769
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
WHO STILL WANTS YOU

19:29.769 --> 19:31.771
IS LIVING 100 YARDS AWAY,

19:31.771 --> 19:34.474
AND HER BREASTS
ARE 95 YARDS AWAY.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.406
WHY DO YOU WANT
THAT TEMPTATION?

19:36.406 --> 19:38.408
HEY, I DIDN'T ASK HER
TO MOVE HERE.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.410
WELL...

19:40.410 --> 19:45.315
MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU ASK HER TO LEAVE.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.523
SO THE WHOLE RIGHT SIDE
OF THE CLOSET IS YOURS,

19:53.523 --> 19:56.526
AND I EMPTIED OUT
THE TOP DRAWERS OF THE BUREAU

19:56.526 --> 20:00.430
FOR YOUR SOCKS AND THOSE CUTE
LITTLE BOXER BRIEFS YOU WEAR.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.432
THANK YOU.

20:02.432 --> 20:04.434
AND AFTER WE'VE
GOTTEN YOU SETTLED,

20:04.434 --> 20:06.936
I WANT US TO GO OVER
AND TELL THE GIRLS.

20:06.936 --> 20:10.680
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE.
BREE VAN DE KAMP LIVING IN SIN.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.382
COME HERE.

20:12.382 --> 20:14.884
WHAT IS IT?

20:14.884 --> 20:17.817
WE LOVE EACH OTHER, RIGHT?
 MM-HMM.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.490
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO AHEAD AND WEAR THIS?

20:22.852 --> 20:25.625
KEITH.
 NO, IF--IF--IF MARRIAGE
IS WHERE WE'RE HEADED,

20:25.625 --> 20:27.957
I JUST KEEP THINKING,
WHAT'S THE HARM?

20:27.957 --> 20:30.360
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.336
(sighs) LOOK, I'M NOT
TRYING TO RUSH YOU,

20:36.336 --> 20:38.338
BUT I NEED
A BIGGER COMMITMENT

20:38.338 --> 20:41.411
THAN JUST THE TOP COUPLE
DRAWERS IN YOUR BUREAU.

20:41.411 --> 20:42.712
(chuckles)

20:42.712 --> 20:44.414
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

20:44.414 --> 20:48.348
I'M NOT READY TO MAKE
THAT KIND OF PROMISE.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.520
MMM.

20:52.382 --> 20:53.683
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.257
BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA
WAKE UP ONE DAY

20:58.257 --> 21:00.560
AND FIND OUT THAT I WAS
JUST SOME DIVERSION

21:00.560 --> 21:02.562
THAT, UH, YOU NEEDED
TO AMUSE YOURSELF

21:02.562 --> 21:04.534
WHILE GETTING THROUGH
YOUR DIVORCE.

21:04.534 --> 21:07.036
IF YOU REALLY THINK
I FEEL THAT WAY,

21:07.036 --> 21:09.799
THEN WHY ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

21:09.799 --> 21:13.373
I'M--I'M STARTING
TO WONDER THAT MYSELF.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.806
(scoffs)

21:16.806 --> 21:20.510
DO YOU THINK US LIVING TOGETHER
IS A MISTAKE?

21:22.582 --> 21:25.915
NO. NO, I THINK US
IS A MISTAKE.

21:32.662 --> 21:35.895
I WISH WE HAD BEEN
NICER TO PAUL.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.898
I WISH WE HAD STOOD BY HIM
WHEN HE WAS ON TRIAL.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.901
I THINK ABOUT WHAT HE MUST HAVE
GONE THROUGH IN PRISON,

21:41.901 --> 21:45.304
AND I UNDERSTAND HIS RAGE.
I DO.

21:45.304 --> 21:49.379
BUT I WON'T ALLOW HIM
TO DESTROY THIS STREET.

21:49.379 --> 21:51.981
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

21:51.981 --> 21:54.313
DON'T WORRY.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.586
WE WILL STOP
THIS SON OF A BITCH.

21:58.588 --> 22:01.351
THAT'S A PROMISE.

22:11.361 --> 22:13.903
DON'T LIE. (chuckles)

22:15.034 --> 22:17.737
HEY. M.J.'s SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE,

22:17.737 --> 22:20.740
SO I DON'T CARE IF
THIS PROTEST GOES ALL NIGHT.

22:20.740 --> 22:24.013
I'M HERE TO THE BITTER END.
HOW CAN I HELP?
 WE NEED MORE SIGNS PAINTED.

22:24.013 --> 22:25.515
OKAY.
 HEY, SUSAN.

22:25.515 --> 22:30.420
LOOK ON THAT PAPER. WE CAME UP
WITH A WHOLE LIST OF SLOGANS.

22:30.420 --> 22:33.122
JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE GOT PLENTY
OF "THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN,"

22:33.122 --> 22:35.925
AND WE NEED A LOT MORE
"WHO LET THE CONS OUT?"

22:35.925 --> 22:37.457
(chuckles)

22:37.457 --> 22:41.360
SO, WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE HOPING
TO ACCOMPLISH WITH ALL THIS?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.863
THE MAYOR IS IN A CLOSE RACE
FOR RE-ELECTION.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.365
HE NEEDS EVERY VOTE HE CAN GET.
IF WE CAN MAKE

22:46.365 --> 22:48.868
A BIG ENOUGH STINK IN FRONT
OF THE NEWS CAMERAS,

22:48.868 --> 22:51.971
MAYBE WE CAN EMBARRASS HIM
INTO SHUTTING THAT PLACE DOWN.

22:51.971 --> 22:56.876
SO IF THIS PROTEST WORKS,
AND THE PLACE DOESN'T OPEN,

22:56.876 --> 22:59.048
WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL THOSE EX-CONS?

22:59.048 --> 23:02.151
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM?

23:02.151 --> 23:05.014
I MEAN, I-IF THEY DON'T GET TO
STAY HERE, WHERE WILL THEY GO?

23:05.014 --> 23:07.156
THEY'LL JUST GO BACK TO WHERE
THEY CAME FROM,

23:07.156 --> 23:09.088
OR SOME HOUSE
IN ANOTHER NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.021
BUT WHAT IF THAT NEIGHBORHOOD
DOESN'T WANT THEM EITHER?
 WELL--

23:12.021 --> 23:14.023
I MEAN,
IF THEY'VE DONE THEIR TIME,

23:14.023 --> 23:17.126
AND THEY NEED A SECOND CHANCE,
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER FOR THEM

23:17.126 --> 23:19.128
TO BE IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD?

23:19.128 --> 23:22.131
IN THEORY, YES, BUT THAT'S NOT
THE WAY THE WORLD WORKS.

23:22.131 --> 23:25.074
WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, OUR CHILDREN.

23:25.074 --> 23:27.637
OURSELVES?

23:27.637 --> 23:31.110
DON'T BE CUTE. SOME OF THESE MEN
MAY HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS,

23:31.110 --> 23:34.484
BUT SOME OF THEM COULD
STILL BE REALLY BAD GUYS.

23:34.484 --> 23:36.986
BUT IF WE DON'T EVEN TRY
TO HELP THEM,

23:36.986 --> 23:39.719
ARE WE SO SURE
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS?

23:52.031 --> 23:54.604
(doorbell rings)
 (sighs)

23:54.604 --> 23:56.606
(door squeaks)

23:56.606 --> 23:58.107
RICHARD.

23:58.107 --> 24:00.970
KEITH TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.
I'M SO SORRY.

24:00.970 --> 24:03.112
THANK YOU.

24:04.814 --> 24:07.076
SO, UH, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

24:07.076 --> 24:10.980
(laughs) HE ALSO MENTIONED ALL
THAT WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

24:10.980 --> 24:15.124
IN YOUR BACKYARD. LUCKILY, I
TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

24:15.124 --> 24:18.057
UH, WAIT. UH, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

24:18.057 --> 24:22.031
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. I'LL HAVE
IT DONE BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

24:22.031 --> 24:24.033
BUT IF YOU WANNA THANK ME,

24:24.033 --> 24:28.067
THINK YOU COULD FIND ME
SOMETHING COLD TO DRINK?

24:33.843 --> 24:36.075
(car door closes)

24:36.075 --> 24:38.608
MAYOR FRANKLIN. WHAT AN HONOR.
PAUL YOUNG.

24:38.608 --> 24:41.911
YOU MUST BE THE GOOD SAMARITAN
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.
 THIS IS MY WIFE BETH.

24:41.911 --> 24:44.954
I'VE NEVER MET
A CELEBRITY BEFORE.
 WELL, NOW YOU HAVE.

24:44.954 --> 24:46.786
THE MEDIA WILL BE
ARRIVING SHORTLY,

24:46.786 --> 24:48.788
AS WELL AS SOME OF
THE MAYOR'S SUPPORTERS.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.060
UH, WITH THE ELECTION
JUST A FEW DAYS AWAY,

24:51.060 --> 24:53.893
WE THOUGHT THIS COULD BE
A TERRIFIC PHOTO OP.
 NO PROBLEM.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.065
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING, WOULD YOU
LIKE A TOUR OF THE FACILITY?

24:56.065 --> 24:58.928
ABSOLUTELY. I MUST SAY, I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU GOT YOUR NEIGHBORS

24:58.928 --> 25:01.631
TO AGREE TO A HALFWAY HOUSE
ON THEIR STREET,

25:01.631 --> 25:03.633
BUT THEY MUST THINK
A LOT OF YOU.

25:03.633 --> 25:06.636
HONESTLY, THIS IS ALL HAPPENING
BECAUSE OF WHAT I THINK OF THEM.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.243
(door opens)
 RICHARD? IS THAT YOU?

25:14.243 --> 25:19.849
(door closes)
 THE LEMONADE'S NOT QUITE
READY YET.

25:19.849 --> 25:22.992
RICHARD, WOULD YOU LIKE
A SANDWICH WITH THAT--

25:27.056 --> 25:29.629
WHO ARE YOU?

25:29.629 --> 25:32.932
THIS THE HALFWAY HOUSE?

25:32.932 --> 25:36.736
UH, NO. THAT'S NEXT DOOR.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.708
AH.

25:38.708 --> 25:41.641
SO I GUESS
WE'RE GONNA BE NEIGHBORS.

25:43.713 --> 25:45.715
WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'RE IN A HURRY

25:45.715 --> 25:48.718
TO GET SETTLED IN
OVER THERE, SO...

25:50.950 --> 25:54.553
I'M IN NO HURRY.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.331
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

26:02.331 --> 26:07.967
UH, THIS, UM, GENTLEMAN JUST,
UH, WANDERED INTO MY HOME.

26:11.340 --> 26:15.945
I MADE A MISTAKE.

26:15.945 --> 26:18.778
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.579
IT BETTER NOT.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.887
(door opens)
 (exhales deeply)

26:27.887 --> 26:30.159
(door closes)
 YOU OKAY?

26:30.159 --> 26:33.623
YEAH, I'M FINE, I WAS JUST,
UH, TAKEN BY SURPRISE.

26:33.623 --> 26:34.964
(breathes deeply)

26:34.964 --> 26:36.966
YOU'RE SHAKING.
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.

26:36.966 --> 26:39.068
NO, REALLY... REALLY,
I'M FINE, JUST, UM...

26:39.068 --> 26:41.070
THANK YOU FOR
TAKING CARE OF THAT.

26:41.070 --> 26:42.802
(chuckles)

26:46.135 --> 26:48.908
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:48.908 --> 26:51.941
SOMETHING I'VE WANTED TO DO
FOR A LONG TIME.

26:57.687 --> 27:00.019
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.695
OKAY. MAYBE I MISREAD
SOME SIGNALS.

27:05.695 --> 27:08.858
THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNALS.
I WAS DATING YOUR SON.

27:08.858 --> 27:12.331
OKAY. IF THAT'S
THE WAY YOU FEEL,

27:12.331 --> 27:14.633
THEN I'LL FINISH UP
OUT BACK AND GO.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.908
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE NOW.
 LOOK, I MADE AN ERROR
IN JUDGMENT. I'M--I'M SORRY.

27:18.908 --> 27:22.211
PLEASE LET ME FINISH THE WORK.
 (whispers) I SAID NOW.

27:22.211 --> 27:26.816
I WILL LEAVE
WHEN I'M FINISHED.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.085
(man) OKAY.
YEAH, YEAH, HERE WE ARE.

27:38.357 --> 27:42.061
(indistinct conversations)

27:42.061 --> 27:44.794
WELL, HERE'S TROUBLE.

27:44.794 --> 27:47.096
BUNCH OF GEEKS WITH
"VOTE FRANKLIN" SIGNS

27:47.096 --> 27:48.798
JUST SHOWED UP.

27:48.798 --> 27:51.801
LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE OUTNUMBERED NOW.

27:55.204 --> 27:58.948
OH, I'M NOT WORRIED.

28:02.051 --> 28:04.854
WHO THE HELL ARE THEY?

28:04.854 --> 28:07.717
THE CAVALRY.

28:16.425 --> 28:20.069
HEY, GUYS. GUYS!

28:20.069 --> 28:21.931
I'M NOT TOO LATE, AM I?
 NOPE.

28:21.931 --> 28:24.974
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

28:24.974 --> 28:27.006
(clatter)

28:27.006 --> 28:29.739
(whispers) OH, YEAH.

28:39.889 --> 28:41.791
(indistinct conversations)

28:41.791 --> 28:44.924
OKAY! HERE'S THE PLAN.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.927
ONCE THE MAYOR
BEGINS HIS SPEECH,

28:47.927 --> 28:50.099
I'LL GIVE THE SIGNAL.

28:50.099 --> 28:52.401
THAT'S WHEN WE ALL BEGIN
CHANTING, OKAY? YOU GOT IT?

28:52.401 --> 28:54.764
ALL RIGHT! LET'S GO!

29:08.377 --> 29:10.379
WE NEED TO TALK NOW.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.525
QUITE A TURNOUT.
 (chuckles)

29:16.525 --> 29:18.527
LOOK AT THOSE NEWS CAMERAS.

29:18.527 --> 29:22.061
UH, DO I NEED A LITTLE BASE?
HI-DEF IS KILLING ME.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.362
UNH-UNH.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.296
(man) HEY, FRANKLIN!

29:27.296 --> 29:30.299
(indistinct conversations)

29:35.805 --> 29:37.947
WHERE DID ALL THESE PEOPLE
COME FROM?

29:37.947 --> 29:39.508
I DON'T KNOW.

29:39.508 --> 29:42.511
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE
ABOUT TO GET VERY INTERESTING.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.460
NO, NO, NO!
HOW DID SHE FIND OUT?

29:51.460 --> 29:53.562
YOU TOLD HER
THE OTHER NIGHT!

29:53.562 --> 29:55.164
(sighs)

29:55.164 --> 29:57.496
OH, WHILE WE WERE DRINKING.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.099
YOU WERE DRINKING.
 SHE WAS LISTENING!

30:00.099 --> 30:02.571
OH, MY GOD.
 YEAH, THIS IS BAD.

30:02.571 --> 30:04.333
WHAT ELSE DID YOU SAY TO HER?

30:04.333 --> 30:07.336
I MEAN, SHE THINKS THAT YOU
STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.411
OH, WELL,
THAT'S JUST... RIDICULOUS.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.044
SHE'S NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING
TO LYNETTE, IS SHE?

30:15.044 --> 30:16.585
NO.

30:16.585 --> 30:19.088
DOES SHE WANT YOU
 TO TELL LYNETTE?

30:19.088 --> 30:22.421
NO, SHE HAD
A DIFFERENT SUGGESTION.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.454
AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE.

30:27.396 --> 30:29.528
I'M GOING OUTSIDE
TO WATCH THE PROTEST.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.161
STAY IN YOUR ROOM
AND LOOK AFTER YOUR SISTER.

30:32.161 --> 30:34.463
OH! DON'T GET
INTO THOSE COOKIES I MADE.

30:34.463 --> 30:37.436
THOSE ARE FOR AFTER SUPPER,
AND YES, I COUNTED THEM.

30:39.468 --> 30:42.041
JUANITA, WHAT'S WRONG?

30:42.041 --> 30:44.473
WHAT IS THAT?

30:46.275 --> 30:49.378
THE LETTER
YOU WROTE TO GRACE.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.382
OKAY.

30:53.382 --> 30:55.454
OKAY.

30:57.186 --> 31:02.461
HONEY, YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE READ THIS...

31:04.063 --> 31:05.965
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.397
GRACE IS YOUR DAUGHTER,
ISN'T SHE?

31:08.397 --> 31:11.540
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN CRYING
SINCE SHE LEFT.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.402
YOU LOVE HER MORE THAN ME.

31:13.402 --> 31:16.275
NO. NO, NO, NO!

31:16.275 --> 31:17.606
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

31:17.606 --> 31:21.610
YOU ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THIS WORLD TO ME.

31:21.610 --> 31:26.085
YOU BELIEVE MOMMY,
DON'T YOU?

31:26.085 --> 31:27.386
OH...

31:29.058 --> 31:30.889
YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.891
JUANITA!

31:32.891 --> 31:35.164
COME BACK HERE!
 (door opens)

31:35.164 --> 31:36.895
JUANITA!
 (crowd shouting)

31:36.895 --> 31:40.069
JUANITA!

31:44.203 --> 31:47.306
JUANITA!

31:47.306 --> 31:50.139
(man, amplified voice)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU

31:50.139 --> 31:53.512
MAYOR HAROLD FRANKLIN!

31:53.512 --> 31:57.416
(cheering and whistling)

31:57.416 --> 31:59.918
(microphone feedback whines)

31:59.918 --> 32:01.690
(crowd) SAVE OUR STREET!

32:01.690 --> 32:05.424
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

32:05.424 --> 32:09.398
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

32:09.398 --> 32:11.600
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

32:11.600 --> 32:14.003
SAVE OUR STREET!

32:14.003 --> 32:16.335
(amplified voice)
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.267
IT'S A PLEASURE AND AN HONOR
TO BE HERE...

32:18.267 --> 32:19.568
I THOUGHT YOU SAID

32:19.568 --> 32:22.171
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WAS BEHIND THIS.

32:22.171 --> 32:24.373
DID I?
I APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN WRONG.

32:24.373 --> 32:26.045
...WITH A TROUBLED PAST THAT'S
IS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.548
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

32:29.548 --> 32:31.480
...INVENTORY OF COMPASSIONATE,
UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE!

32:31.480 --> 32:34.353
IF I EVER GET MY HANDS
ON PAUL YOUNG, I WILL KILL HIM.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.455
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
IN THE HOTEL?

32:36.455 --> 32:39.158
THERE'S A LOT
OF ANGRY PEOPLE OUT THERE.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.529
I KNOW.

32:42.361 --> 32:47.336
(crowd) SAVE OUR STREET! SAVE
OUR STREET! SAVE OUR STREET!

32:47.336 --> 32:49.598
(Franklin)
YOUR ACTIONS ARE A BLUEPRINT

32:49.598 --> 32:51.670
FOR OTHERS TO EMULATE.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.303
AND THAT CERTAINLY DESCRIBES
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE...
 SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

32:54.303 --> 32:57.576
ON WISTERIA LANE.
 HEY! I TALKED TO TOM.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.549
THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME
TO DISCUSS THIS.

33:00.549 --> 33:03.282
SAVE OUR STREET!
 HEY, WE ARE DISCUSSING IT.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.284
TOM TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR LITTLE,
UH, SUGGESTION

33:05.284 --> 33:07.586
THAT I NEED TO MOVE
OFF THE LANE.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.488
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
THAT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.620
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE REALLY
LYNETTE'S FRIEND,

33:11.620 --> 33:13.492
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT YOU
CANNOT LIVE TWO DOORS DOWN

33:13.492 --> 33:15.724
FROM HER HUSBAND--
A MAN YOU STILL LOVE.

33:15.724 --> 33:18.527
THAT IS NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.
 REALLY?

33:18.527 --> 33:22.000
'CAUSE I AM LYNETTE'S FRIEND,
AND I'M NOT GONNA STAND BY

33:22.000 --> 33:24.002
AND WATCH YOU
SCREW UP HER MARRIAGE.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.576
SO HELP ME, SUSAN--
 HEY, GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

33:27.576 --> 33:30.008
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

33:30.008 --> 33:32.010
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

33:32.010 --> 33:34.213
SAVE OUR STREET! SAVE
OUR STREET! SAVE OUR STREET!

33:34.213 --> 33:38.617
(chanting continues)

33:38.617 --> 33:41.620
I'M PARKED THREE BLOCKS AWAY.
IT'S CRAZY OUT HERE.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.552
DID YOU FINISH UP EVERYTHING?

33:43.552 --> 33:47.656
OH, YEAH. I'M DONE.

33:47.656 --> 33:49.228
...BLUEPRINT FOR OTHERS
TO EMULATE.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.759
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE GONNA HAVE...

33:50.759 --> 33:53.532
(door squeaks)

33:53.532 --> 33:55.704
HEY. I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

33:55.704 --> 33:57.506
WHAT'S WRONG?

33:57.506 --> 33:59.508
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW

33:59.508 --> 34:02.411
THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT
WITH YOUR FATHER.

34:04.173 --> 34:06.645
SAVE OUR STREET!
SAVE OUR STREET!

34:06.645 --> 34:09.378
IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS ONE MAN,
PAUL YOUNG...

34:09.378 --> 34:13.222
(crowd booing)

34:13.222 --> 34:18.226
TH-THOUGH HE WAS
UNFAIRLY INCARCERATED,

34:18.226 --> 34:21.159
HE HAS CHOSEN...

34:21.159 --> 34:23.692
CARLOS!
I CAN'T FIND JUANITA.

34:23.692 --> 34:26.364
YOU LET HER OUTSIDE
WITH ALL THIS GOING ON?

34:26.364 --> 34:29.768
NO, SHE RAN AWAY!
SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT GRACE!
 HOW?

34:31.670 --> 34:34.672
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
JUST HELP ME FIND HER!

34:34.672 --> 34:37.246
(sighs) JUANITA!

34:37.246 --> 34:39.348
JUANITA, WHERE ARE YOU?

34:39.348 --> 34:41.210
JUANITA!

34:41.210 --> 34:42.710
JUANITA!

34:42.710 --> 34:45.184
CAN'T I GO BACK
AND GET IT?
 IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT, LEE.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.786
SHE SIGNED THAT PROGRAM AFTER
HER CONCERT AT CARNEGIE HALL.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.688
SHE WAS A DRUG ADDICT.
LET IT GO.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.690
(chanting continues)

34:52.690 --> 34:56.795
(Franklin continues
speaking indistinctly)

34:56.795 --> 34:58.567
(engine starts)

35:00.269 --> 35:05.134
(horn honks)
 CAN YOU MOVE, PLEASE?!

35:05.134 --> 35:06.275
(sighs)

35:06.275 --> 35:07.706
COME ON!

35:07.706 --> 35:09.708
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.110
COME HERE. (grunts)

35:12.110 --> 35:13.542
HEY.

35:13.542 --> 35:17.846
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
 LOOK,
I MADE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

35:17.846 --> 35:20.349
HEY, DON'T PUSH ME.
OH!

35:20.349 --> 35:24.293
HEY, ONE OF THOSE CONS
IS BEATING UP A GUY.

35:24.293 --> 35:26.295
GET HIM!
 (grunts)

35:26.295 --> 35:28.257
KEITH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 COME ON!

35:28.257 --> 35:29.628
GET HIM!

35:29.628 --> 35:32.431
OH!
 SAVE OUR STREET!

35:32.431 --> 35:35.133
(Franklin)
...THROUGH HIS GENEROSITY.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.237
HE HAS CHOSEN NOT
TO BE ANGRY OR BITTER...

35:38.237 --> 35:40.869
(grunting)

35:40.869 --> 35:42.471
GET OFF OF HIM!

35:42.471 --> 35:44.173
LADY, TAKE IT EASY!
 UHH!

35:44.173 --> 35:48.547
(Keith grunting,
punches landing)

35:48.547 --> 35:50.179
...WHO WERE ONCE
HIS PRISON MATES.

35:50.179 --> 35:52.881
AND I'M HONORED
TO PRESENT THIS MEDALLION

35:52.881 --> 35:54.783
TO A MAN--

35:54.783 --> 35:57.756
(booing)

35:57.756 --> 35:59.228
(indistinct shouting)

35:59.228 --> 36:02.461
AND IN CONCLUSION,
LOVE THY NEIGHBOR!

36:02.461 --> 36:04.693
SUSAN!

36:04.693 --> 36:07.196
LISTEN TO ME! IF YOU
DON'T CARE ABOUT MY LIFE,

36:07.196 --> 36:09.868
THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO LYNETTE!
 I AM THINKING ABOUT LYNETTE!

36:09.868 --> 36:11.440
THIS WOULD DESTROY HER!

36:11.440 --> 36:13.872
(grunting)

36:15.704 --> 36:17.206
GET OFF OF HIM!

36:17.206 --> 36:18.877
(gun cocks, gunshot)

36:18.877 --> 36:20.749
(shouting stops)

36:22.251 --> 36:27.656
(screaming)

36:38.967 --> 36:42.931
JUANITA!

36:42.931 --> 36:45.674
OW! OW! (grunts)

36:45.674 --> 36:50.279
AAH!

36:51.880 --> 36:54.843
YOU'RE PUSHING! (grunts)

36:54.843 --> 36:56.485
SUSAN.

36:56.485 --> 36:58.947
(grunts) STOP PUSHING!

36:58.947 --> 37:00.419
SUSAN!

37:00.419 --> 37:02.451
(screaming)

37:02.451 --> 37:04.323
SUSAN!

37:04.323 --> 37:05.824
OHH! OW! OW!

37:21.810 --> 37:24.242
(horn honks)
 GO AROUND THEM! GO AROUND!

37:24.242 --> 37:26.275
I CAN'T!
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE!

37:26.275 --> 37:29.878
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO BACK
IN THE HOUSE.

37:29.878 --> 37:33.852
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.886
(shouting indistinctly)

37:37.886 --> 37:42.030

37:42.030 --> 37:44.032
HEY!

37:47.936 --> 37:50.939
HEY! FRANK, WAIT! WAIT!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

37:50.939 --> 37:53.372
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THIS
HALFWAY HOUSE NEVER OPENS.
 OH, MY GOD!

37:53.372 --> 37:56.345
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT,
ISN'T IT?
 NO, NO! NOT LIKE THIS!
GIVE ME THE BAT! PLEASE!

37:56.345 --> 37:59.348
YOU KNOW WHAT? GO HANG OUT
WITH THE REST OF THE KIDDIES.

37:59.348 --> 38:01.950
FRANK! FRANK, WAIT!

38:01.950 --> 38:04.583
LYNETTE! LYNETTE!

38:14.923 --> 38:17.866
JUST DRIVE. THEY'LL MOVE.

38:38.347 --> 38:40.719
I'M LOOKING FOR SUSAN!

38:40.719 --> 38:42.421
IT'S NOT SAFE! GET DOWN!

38:42.421 --> 38:45.394
I SAW HER FALL!
I THINK SHE'S HURT!

38:45.394 --> 38:47.756
(shouting and pounding continue)
 (cries)

38:50.459 --> 38:53.902
GET OUT OF THE CAR! NOW!

38:53.902 --> 38:56.535

GO INSIDE, DARLING.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.957

ME? THOSE ARE YOUR FRIENDS
OUT THERE, LYNETTE--

39:51.990 --> 39:53.992
THE SOLID CITIZENS
OF FAIRVIEW.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.694
TELL ME AGAIN

39:55.694 --> 39:58.867
WHY YOU THINK THEY'RE BETTER
THAN A BUNCH OF EX-CONS?

40:22.521 --> 40:24.523
OW!

40:26.655 --> 40:28.897
HEY!

40:28.897 --> 40:30.629

LEAVE HIM ALONE! STOP!

40:33.702 --> 40:35.504
HE'S MY NEIGHBOR!

40:37.435 --> 40:39.968
(grunts)
 STOP IT!

40:39.968 --> 40:42.140
TAKE HIM OVER!
GET HIM OVER HERE!

40:42.140 --> 40:43.872
COME ON!

41:28.156 --> 41:30.659
THANK YOU.

41:40.529 --> 41:43.171
(Mary Alice)
IT WAS JUST BEFORE SUNRISE

41:43.171 --> 41:45.173
ON WISTERIA LANE.

41:49.077 --> 41:51.079
YOU COULD NO LONGER HEAR

41:51.079 --> 41:54.643
THE SCREAMS
OF FRIGHTENED BYSTANDERS...

41:54.643 --> 41:57.916
OR THE ANGRY CHANTING
OF PROTESTORS...

41:57.916 --> 42:02.120
OR THE CRIES FOR HELP
FROM THE INJURED.

42:02.120 --> 42:06.124
THERE WERE JUST
THE FOOTSTEPS OF A MAN

42:06.124 --> 42:10.799
WHO HAD FINALLY PUNISHED
THOSE WHO HAD BETRAYED HIM.

42:14.202 --> 42:15.964
(clatter)

42:17.706 --> 42:20.038
THE SILENCE WAS BROKEN

42:20.038 --> 42:25.043
BY SOMETHING THE NEIGHBORS
WOULD LATER SAY...

42:25.043 --> 42:26.214
(gunshot)

42:26.214 --> 42:28.877
SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT.

42:28.877 --> 42:31.880
BUT PAUL KNEW

42:31.880 --> 42:35.553
IT WAS THE SOUND OF REVENGE.
