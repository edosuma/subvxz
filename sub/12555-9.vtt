YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.526

04:05.620 --> 04:07.827

HE CALLED ME.

04:36.902 --> 04:37.892

04:37.986 --> 04:39.192

05:07.974 --> 05:09.635

WILL DO YOU ANY GOOD?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.644
<i>NOW DON'T
GET ME WRONG.</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:17.564
<i>SOMETIMES RUNNING AWAY
IS THE BEST ANSWER.</i>

05:17.651 --> 05:20.268
<i>BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT YOURS
IS THAT SORT OF PROBLEM.</i>

05:20.362 --> 05:24.572
MAYBE IT IS,
MAYBE IT ISN'T.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.529
YOU DO WHAT YOU LIKE.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.997
YOU PROMISE YOU VVON'T PUT
ME IN A STRAITJACKET?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.825
I DON'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.661
OKAY.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.167
OKAY. IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.968
[sighs]

05:47.055 --> 05:49.171
CAN I OPEN THIS?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.055
QUITE A DROP.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.484
UH, MR. HALL,
I'LL, UH--

06:03.572 --> 06:07.531
I'LL HAVE TO CLOSE
THE WINDOW.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.869
I ONLY
WANTED SOME AIR.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.568
WELL, I'LL, UH,

06:10.662 --> 06:12.152
TURN THE CONDITIONER UP.

06:12.247 --> 06:15.160
IT WORKS BEST
WITH THE WINDOWS CLOSED.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.582
DID YOU THINK
I'D JUMP?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.000
YOU MIGHT HAVE.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.998
NOT A CHANCE.
I WANT TO LIVE.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.591
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.210
OH?

06:24.301 --> 06:27.714
ALL RIGHT, MR. HALL,
SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME

06:27.804 --> 06:30.387
ALL ABOUT IT. EVERYTHING.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.975
START ANYWHERE.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.550
OKAY, BUT I'M
WARNING YOU

06:34.644 --> 06:36.601
YOU'RE GONNA THINK
I LOST MY MARBLES.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.806
NO. MARBLES
CAN BE FOUND, MR. HALL.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.107
GO ON.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.740
DID YOU EVER LOOK
AT THIS PICTURE?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.617
I MEAN,
REALLY LOOK AT IT?

06:56.708 --> 07:00.622
<i>(Doctor)
I THINK So, WHY?</i>

07:00.712 --> 07:03.545
HAS IT EVER MOVED?

07:03.632 --> 07:04.918
NO.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.590
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, ANYWAY.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.088
I CAN MAKE IT MOVE.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.341
CAN YOU?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.421
<i>YES.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:16.725
BUT NOT REALLY.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.724
VVHEN I VVAS A KID, VVE HAD A
PICTURE LIKE THIS IN OUR HOUSE.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.192
NOT THE SAME THING EXACTLY,
BUT PRETTY CLOSE.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.391
A BOAT.

07:24.486 --> 07:27.069
<i>(Hall) M Y MO THER USED TO
TELL ME TO I OOK A T IT.</i>

07:27.155 --> 07:30.398
<i>SHE SAID IF I LOOKED AT IT
LONG ENOUGH IT WOULD MOVE.</i>

07:30.492 --> 07:33.530
<i>ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS KEEP LOOKING AT IT.</i>

07:33.620 --> 07:37.158
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER,
BUT THE IDEA FASCINATED ME.

07:37.248 --> 07:41.537
ONE NIGHT I SPENT A VVHOLE HOUR
JUST STARING AT THAT SILLY BOAT.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.416
<i>AND DID IT MOVE?</i>

07:44.506 --> 07:46.417
YES.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.466
NOVV, YOU UNDERSTAND, THERE'S
NOTHING STRANGE ABOUT THAT.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.963
IT WAS AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.795
<i>YEAH, I KNOW.</i>

07:52.889 --> 07:56.177
EXCEPT THAT AFTER A WHILE,
I COULDN'T CONTROL IT.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.975
EVERY TIME I LOOKED AT THAT
BOAT, THE SAILS VVOULD FILL,

07:59.062 --> 08:00.678
AND THEY WOULD BEGIN TO DIP.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.514
I JUST COULDN'T STOP IT.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.225
IMAGINATION IS STRONG
IN A GROWING BOY.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.605
YEAH, I REALIZE THAT.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.404
I REALIZED IT
EVEN THEN.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.481
BUT THE POINT IS,

08:12.575 --> 08:15.738
I GOT JUST AS SCARED AS IF
IT VVERE REALLY HAPPENING.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.490
THE MIND IS EVERYTHING.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.617
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT
A PAIN IN YOUR ARM,

08:19.708 --> 08:21.699
AND THERE'S NO
PHYSICAL REASON FOR IT,

08:21.793 --> 08:24.080
IT HURTS JUST THE
SAME, DOESN'T IT?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.086
GRANTED.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.634
IS THAT HOW YOU MANAGE
TO STAY AWAKE?

08:40.729 --> 08:43.015
HOW ELSE?

08:43.106 --> 08:44.221
HOW MANY GRAINS A DAY?

08:44.315 --> 08:45.692
<i>I DON'T KNOW.</i>

08:45.775 --> 08:47.607
I HAVEN'T GOT
MUCH LONGER ANYWAY.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.560
YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE REST OR NOT?

08:49.654 --> 08:51.395
YES.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.945
VVHEN I VVAS 15, I DEVELOPED
A RHEUMATIC HEART.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.700
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
REALLY GET WELL.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.371
THAT I'D HAVE
TO TAKE IT EASY.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.869
NO STRENUOUS EXERCISE.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.870
NO LONG WALKS,

09:04.961 --> 09:07.077
NO STAIRS, NO SHOCKS.

09:07.172 --> 09:12.667
AVOID ANY KIND
OF SHOCK, THEY SAID.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.002
THEY FORGOT
ABOUT MY IMAGINATION.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.009
THREE YEARS AGO,
A WOMAN WAS KILLED BY A MAN

09:18.099 --> 09:20.386
WHO WAS HIDDEN
IN THE BACKSEAT OF HER CAR.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.344
YOU MAY HAVE
READ ABOUT IT. I DID.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.725
ANYWAY, IT STARTED
ME THINKING.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.728
MAYBE SOMEBODY WAS HIDING
IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY CAR.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.071
MAYBE ONE NIGHT DRIVING
OVER LAUREL CANYON,

09:31.154 --> 09:32.940
I'D LOOK UP IN
THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.863
AND I'D SEE SOMEBODY
OR SOMETHING

09:34.949 --> 09:39.364
COMING UP
OUT OF THE DARKNESS.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.946
<i>I HAD TO DRIVE
THE CANYON TWICE A DA Y.</i>

09:42.040 --> 09:44.077
<i>IT'S A ROUGH ROAD.</i>

09:44.167 --> 09:46.283
<i>ONE SLIP
AND YOU'RE OVER THE EDGE.</i>

09:46.377 --> 09:49.039
<i>ONE NIGHT, LIKE EVERY OTHER
NIGHT, I HEADED FOR HOME.</i>

09:49.130 --> 09:51.212
<i>SUDDENLY, I
FELT UNCOMFORTABLE,</i>

09:51.299 --> 09:53.461
<i>AS IF I WEREN'T ALONE
IN THE CAR.</i>

09:53.551 --> 09:56.760
<i>IT WAS RIDICULOUS, BUT I
COULDN'T SHAKE THE SENSATION.</i>

09:56.846 --> 10:00.009
<i>I KEPT THINKING
THERE'S SOMEBODY BACK THERE.</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:02.888
<i>I'LL LOOK IN THE REAR-VIEW
MIRROR AND I'LL SEE HIS FACE.</i>

10:02.977 --> 10:05.890
<i>THEN I'LL SEE
HIS HANDS REACHING UP,</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:08.722
<i>HERE'S THE IMPORTANT
THING, DOCTOR.</i>

10:08.817 --> 10:11.104
<i>I KNEW INTELLECTUALLY
THAT I WAS ALONE.</i>

10:11.194 --> 10:13.481
<i>BUT I ALSO KNEW
THAT MY IMAGINATION</i>

10:13.571 --> 10:17.530
<i>WOULD MAKE ME SEE SOMETHING IF I
THOUGHT ABOUT IT LONG ENOUGH.</i>

10:17.575 --> 10:19.407
<i>[eerie music]</i>

10:31.005 --> 10:32.541
<i>[honking horn]</i>

10:34.467 --> 10:35.844
[brakes screech]

10:38.847 --> 10:41.384
OF COURSE, THERE WASN'T
ANYONE ELSE IN THE CAR.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.011
IT WAS ALL IN MY MIND.

10:44.102 --> 10:47.595
VVHAT DIFFERENCE DID THAT MAKE?
I CRASHED ANYVVAY.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.054
I WAS LUCKY.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.265
THE SHOCK SHOULD
HAVE KILLED ME.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.942
I COULDN'T SURVIVE ANOTHER
ONE, THE DOCTOR SAID.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.359
I COULD BE SURE
OF THAT.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.279
AND HAS THERE
BEEN ANOTHER ONE?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.152
NO.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.951
BUT THERE VVILL BE, JUST
AS SOON AS I FALL ASLEEP.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.994
THE GIRL WILL BE
IN THIS DREAM AGAIN.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.324
AND lT'LL BE THE LAST SHOCK.

11:22.807 --> 11:26.550
VVHEN I VVAS A KID, I USED
TO DREAM IN SEQUENCE.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.511
REMEMBER
THE ADVENTURE SERIALS

11:29.606 --> 11:31.438
THEY USED TO HAVE
IN MOVIE THEATERS?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.764
IT WAS LIKE THAT.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.193
EVERY DREAM
WAS A CHAPTER.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.486
I'D ALWAYS REMEMBER
BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP,

11:38.573 --> 11:40.063
I'D WRITE DOWN
WHAT HAPPENED.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.106
IT'S CRAZY, HUH?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.158
NOT NECESSARILY.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.236
IT COULD SIMPLY BE THAT THE
DREAMS CONFORMED TO THE NOTES,

11:46.331 --> 11:48.242
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.200
THEN YOU DON'T THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE TO DREAM IN EPISODES?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.126
I DON'T SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.797
IT ISN'T. BELIEVE ME.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.750
FOR A LONG TIME,
I DIDN'T DREAM AT ALL.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.006
THEN A WEEK AGO,
IT STARTED.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.555
I WENT TO BED
AT AROUND 11:30.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.101
I VVASN'T TOO TIRED, BUT I NEEDED
THE REST BECAUSE OF MY HEART.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.770
I DON'T KNOVV VVHEN I FELL
ASLEEP, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN,

12:11.856 --> 12:13.767
I WASN'T AT HOME ANYMORE.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.394
I WAS AT
AN AMUSEMENT PARK.
