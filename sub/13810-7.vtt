It's a beautiful day

{\an5}THAT WE GOT
SOME DUDE NAMED MR. B.
AS OUR TEACHER.

02:38.658 --> 02:43.746
{\an5}FOR ALL I KNOW, THIS MR. B.
COULD BE THE TOUGHEST DUDE
TO EVER TEACH IN OCEAN SHORES.

WERE LEAVING YOUR HANDPRINTS
AT MADTOWN

03:38.551 --> 03:41.721

FOR MY TEACHING DEGREE!

03:41.804 --> 03:43.932

NO WAY!

WAY.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.311
AND DON'T WORRY.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.606
MY TEACHING HERE DOES NOT MEAN
THAT MADTOWN WILL BE CLOSED.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.317
I WILL STILL COACH
THE SCHOOL SKATEBOARD TEAM.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.861
SO, WHEN DO WE
START SKATING?

03:56.945 --> 03:58.655
AFTER SCHOOL.

03:58.738 --> 04:03.868

THAT IS SO COOL.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.194

MY TEACHER, TOO.

04:38.277 --> 04:38.820
YOU GUYS ARE SO LUCKY.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.863
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

04:40.947 --> 04:41.906
HE BAGGED HOMEWORK
ON THE FIRST DAY

04:41.990 --> 04:43.116
SO WE COULD SKATE.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.743
{\an1}MAYBE HE WON'T <i> EVER</i>
GIVE US HOMEWORK!

04:45.827 --> 04:47.996

04:48.079 --> 04:49.831
CONROY'S OUR BUD.
HE'S ONE OF US.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.876
{\an5}HE KNOWS THAT NAILING
ALL THESE FAKIE FLIPS
OFF AERIALS

04:53.960 --> 04:55.461
IS A LOT COOLER THAN...

04:55.545 --> 04:58.256
BOOK THINGS.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.217
{\an1}BESIDES, WE'RE THE TWO BEST
SKATEBOARDERS ON THE SKATE TEAM

05:01.300 --> 05:05.221
AND WE'VE GOT OUR FIRST
BIG CONTEST COMING UP.

05:05.304 --> 05:08.057

THE MORE TIME WE HAVE
TO PRACTICE. DUH!

{\an1}FOR THE BIG FREESTYLE
CONTEST TOMORROW.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.469
{\an1}I WAS THINKING OF
STARTING OFF WITH, UH...

06:26.552 --> 06:28.846
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
SKATEBOARDING, TWISTER!

06:28.930 --> 06:30.807
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR BEHAVIOR IN SCHOOL.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.225
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:32.308 --> 06:35.103
DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

06:35.186 --> 06:40.149
{\an5}WOW, YOU SOUND LIKE MY MOM...
EXCEPT YOUR VOICE IS DEEPER
AND YOUR ACCENT IS DIFFERENT.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.652
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU'RE MAD?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.403
NO, I'M VERY FRUSTRATED!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.656
I KNOW YOU BOYS KNOW BETTER.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.118
NOW, IF YOU DON'T SHAPE UP,
I'LL BE FORCED TO TAKE ACTION.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.160
WHAT DO U MEAN?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.287
DETENTION,
SUSPENSION

06:53.371 --> 06:54.872
GETTING CUT
FROM THE SKATEBOARD TEAM

06:54.956 --> 06:57.375
IS WHAT I MEAN!

06:57.458 --> 06:59.669
WOW, WE'RE SORRY.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.254
SORRY, DUDE.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.964
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS
AND YOU'RE ON THE TEAM

07:03.047 --> 07:07.051
{\an5}I DON'T WANT
OTHER STUDENTS THINKING
YOU GET SPECIAL TREATMENT.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.554
SPECIAL TREATMENT?

07:09.637 --> 07:11.430
OTHER STUDENTS?

07:11.514 --> 07:15.184
I READ YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR, MR. B.

07:15.268 --> 07:19.939
GOOD! WE CAN PUT ALL THIS BEHIND
US IF YOU JUST DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.149
CLEAR?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.567
CRYSTAL.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.652
YOU GOT IT, CONROY.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.242
THOSE GUYS ARE
ASKING FOR IT.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.093
DUDE, SHOULDN'T WE BE
DOING OUR HOMEWORK?

07:49.177 --> 07:51.637
CONROY WAS PRETTY HARSH TODAY.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.055
DON'T YOU GET IT, TWIST?

07:53.139 --> 07:56.350
CONROY JUST DOESN'T WANT
THE OTHER KIDS TO GET JEALOUS

07:56.434 --> 07:58.477
BECAUSE THE THREE OF US
ARE BROS.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.395
REALLY?

07:59.478 --> 08:00.688
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY:

08:00.771 --> 08:02.982
{\an1}WHAT REALLY MATTERS
IS THE SKATE CONTEST.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.483
SO IT'S LIKE WE <i> ARE</i>
DOING OUR HOMEWORK.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.697
OH, YEAH...!

HUH?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.954
CONROY, MY MAN.

08:17.038 --> 08:17.914
OTTO, TWISTER.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.249
I CAN CALL YOU CONROY NOW,
CAN'T I?

08:20.333 --> 08:23.920
{\an5}THAT DEPENDS.
I STOP BEING YOUR TEACHER
WHEN YOUR HOMEWORK IS DONE.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.256
RELAX, CONROY, WE'RE DOING IT
RIGHT NOW. LOOK.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.051
THIS IS NO GOOD!

08:30.134 --> 08:34.472
{\an5}IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME
THAT YOU HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR ME AS YOUR TEACHER!

08:34.554 --> 08:36.849
WE RESPECT YOU
AS OUR TEAM COACH.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.102
{\an1}YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR MADTOWN SKATE BRO?

08:40.186 --> 08:44.148
HE GOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
BY SOME FRIENDS OF HIS!

08:44.232 --> 08:47.777
I CLEARLY WARNED YOU BOYS.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.363
NO HOMEWORK, NO CONTEST.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.907
BUT, BUT, BUT...

08:52.990 --> 08:55.910
WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING
FOR THE CONTEST FOR WEEKS.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.620
YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

08:57.703 --> 08:58.996
WHEN YOU DECIDED
NOT TO LISTEN IN SCHOOL.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.623
I WARNED YOU.

09:00.706 --> 09:05.503
NOW, INSTEAD OF COMPETITION,
YOU GET DETENTION.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.800
THERE'S NO WAY MY MOM'S
GOING TO UNDERSTAND THIS.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.682
AAH... AAH...

09:17.765 --> 09:19.767
AAH...!

09:19.850 --> 09:20.685
OOEY!

09:20.768 --> 09:21.811
{\an1}OW...

09:21.894 --> 09:24.021
(<i> deep voice</i> ):
THE DARK SORCERESS

09:24.105 --> 09:25.648
MUST TEND TO MY WOUNDS.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.567
(<i> normal voice, crying</i> ):
MOMMY, I NEED A BAND-AID!

09:29.277 --> 09:32.280
WE'RE GETTING CREAMED!

09:32.363 --> 09:36.659
Next up for Team Madtown,
Oliver Van Rossum!

09:38.661 --> 09:39.787
AAH... OH, NO!

09:39.870 --> 09:40.830
(<i> grunts</i> )

09:40.913 --> 09:43.249
OH...

09:43.332 --> 09:46.168
FEELS LIKE WE'VE
BEEN HERE FOREVER!

09:46.252 --> 09:49.171
I CAN'T BELIEVE CONROY
TURNED ON US LIKE THAT.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.339
SOME FRIEND.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.174
I LIKE THE OLD CONROY.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.469
REMEMBER WHEN HE LET US IN
BEFORE MADTOWN OPENED THAT DAY

09:55.553 --> 09:56.596
AND TAUGHT US THE FAKIE SUPREMO?

09:56.679 --> 09:59.765
YEAH, HE REALLY
HELPED US THAT DAY.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.643
YOU KNOW, TWIST, MAYBE WE
SHOULD HELP CONROY FOR A CHANGE.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.813
WE KIND OF BEEN ACTING
LIKE JERKS.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.648
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.

10:07.732 --> 10:08.774
LET'S DO IT.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.526
(<i> bell rings</i> )

10:10.609 --> 10:14.697
(<i> kids cheering in distance</i> )

10:14.780 --> 10:16.741
{\an1}CAN'T WE JUST WATCH
ONE ROUND?

10:18.117 --> 10:21.287
OKAY, OKAY!

10:21.370 --> 10:22.705
(<i> kids cheering</i> )

10:25.625 --> 10:28.753
Otto:
CAN WE TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

10:28.836 --> 10:31.047
WHAT'S THIS?

10:31.130 --> 10:34.967
WE MADE UP ALL THE HOMEWORK
ASSIGNMENTS WE BLEW OFF.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.011
WE EVEN DID THE EXTRA WORK.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.846
IT'S CALLED EXTRA CREDIT.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.056
{\an1}I KNOW WHAT EXTRA CREDIT IS,
TWISTER.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.725
THANK YOU.

10:42.808 --> 10:47.063
AH... THIS IS...
VERY NICE, GUYS.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.481
SORRY WE WERE JERKS.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.734

10:56.781 --> 10:59.533
NOW LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I HAVE PLANNED

10:59.617 --> 11:01.827
FOR NEXT WEEK'S
SCIENCE LAB!

11:06.165 --> 11:08.042
WHOA!

11:08.876 --> 11:12.046
NOW, CLASS,
NOTICE THAT OLIVER

11:12.129 --> 11:14.382
GOT SOME BIG AIR
ON THAT RUN

11:14.465 --> 11:17.385
{\an5}ONLY TO RUDELY COME
CRASHING DOWN TO EARTH
ON THE LANDING.

11:17.468 --> 11:21.097
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE
OF THE LAWS OF GRAVITY AT WORK.

11:21.180 --> 11:21.931
YOU SEE, CLASS...

11:22.014 --> 11:23.099
YEAH!

11:23.182 --> 11:25.559
DUDE, HOW COOL IS THIS?

11:25.643 --> 11:29.230
WOW, ALL OF THESE YEARS
SHREDDING ON THE RAMP

11:29.313 --> 11:31.857

I WAS SO SCIENTIFIC.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.943
{\an1}MR. B.'s NOT ONLY
A GREAT GUY

11:34.026 --> 11:36.070
{\an1}HE'S THE BEST TEACHER

OH... OH, NO!

12:27.955 --> 12:27.997
WHOA!

12:29.290 --> 12:30.166
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M EVER GOING TO DO THAT.

12:30.249 --> 12:30.416
I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.418
Reggie:
BE CAREFUL, ROCKET BOY.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.169
YOU'VE BROKEN
TWO BOARDS THIS MONTH!

12:33.252 --> 12:34.295
DON'T GET TOO MUCH AIR!

12:34.378 --> 12:36.797
NO SUCH THING

12:36.881 --> 12:38.507
AS TOO MUCH AIR!

12:39.425 --> 12:41.844
WHOA...!

12:41.927 --> 12:43.929
THAT'S TOO MUCH AIR, ISN'T IT?

12:45.848 --> 12:46.474
OHH...!

BETTER THAN I DO.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.354
(<i> groaning</i> )

12:52.438 --> 12:54.023
I REALLY ATE IT.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.567
LOOKS LIKE YOU ATE
YOUR BOARD, TOO.

12:56.650 --> 12:57.276
HUH?

12:57.359 --> 13:00.488
OH, MAN, NOT AGAIN!

13:00.571 --> 13:02.114
WHAT ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.365
YOUR DAD OWNS
A SURF SHOP.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.618
OH, DON'T REMIND ME.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.786
{\an1}Ray:
THAT'S UPSIDE DOWN!

13:07.870 --> 13:10.080
{\an1}YOU CAN'T PUT THAT PIECE
TO THAT PIECE.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.832
{\an5}I DON'T THINK
ALL THE FIBERGLASS
IN THE WORLD'S

13:11.916 --> 13:15.044
GOING TO BRING THIS MESS
TOGETHER, BROTHER.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.338
SO... WHAT KIND OF BOARD
AM I GETTING THIS TIME, DAD?

13:17.421 --> 13:19.715
HOLD ON, ROCKET BOY.

13:19.798 --> 13:22.259
{\an5}WE NEED TO DISCUSS
YOUR HABIT OF
BREAKING BOARDS

13:22.343 --> 13:23.886
BEFORE WE TALK
ABOUT A NEW ONE.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.013
THE WAVES BREAK
THE BOARD, DAD.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.557
{\an1}I JUST HAPPEN TO BE THERE
AT THE TIME.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.142
GOOD ONE, LITTLE BROTHER.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.227
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE TIME

13:31.310 --> 13:33.729
I PADDLED OUT
IN 50-FOOT <i> PAKAHA...</i>

13:33.812 --> 13:35.481
SPARE US, BRO, OKAY?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.400
{\an1}I'M TRYING TO TEACH
RESPONSIBILITY OVER HERE.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.401
OH, IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.237
(<i> humming...</i> )

13:41.320 --> 13:43.489
NOW LISTEN, OTTO.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.908
WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION
A THOUSAND TIMES BEFORE.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.410
{\an1}YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO
TAKE CARE OF YOUR THINGS.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.205
I WON'T ALWAYS BE THERE
TO GET YOU A NEW BOARD...

13:51.288 --> 13:53.249

EVERY TIME...

14:12.810 --> 14:17.106
AND YOU THOUGHT MY STORY
WOULDN'T HOLD HIS ATTENTION.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.400
OTTO, SNAP OUT OF IT.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.944
YOU ACT LIKE BOARDS
GROW ON TREES.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.362
ACTUALLY, BROTHER

14:23.445 --> 14:26.782
SURFBOARDS HAVE A LONG HISTORY
OF GROWING ON TREES.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.326
<i>SEE, MY GRANDFATHER</i>
<i>PLANTED A WILIWILI TREE</i>

14:29.410 --> 14:30.786
<i>WHEN I WAS A BOY.</i>

14:30.869 --> 14:35.165
<i>BY THE TIME IT HAD GROWN</i>
<i>BIG AND STRONG, I HAD, TOO.</i>

14:35.249 --> 14:38.669
<i>PERFECT FOR A TRADITIONAL</i>

14:39.962 --> 14:41.213
<i>ONLY I NEVER ASKED</i>
<i>MY GRANDFATHER</i>

14:41.297 --> 14:45.551
<i>IF IT WAS COOL TO CUT DOWN</i>
<i>THAT OLD WILIWILI TREE.</i>

14:47.553 --> 14:50.222
{\an1}WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID YOUR GRANDFATHER SAY?

14:50.306 --> 14:53.642
ONLY ONE THING: "THE SEAGULL
THAT FLIES A CROOKED PATH

14:53.726 --> 14:57.146
HAS A TOUGH TIME
RETURNING HOME."

14:57.229 --> 14:59.064
{\an1}SOUNDS LIKE YOU
GOT OFF EASY.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.234
NO, I WAS GROUNDED
TILL I FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.360
{\an1}OH...

15:03.444 --> 15:04.361
ARE YOU FINISHED?!

15:04.445 --> 15:06.989
LISTEN, OTTO,
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.907
YOU KEEP BREAKING YOUR BOARDS

15:08.991 --> 15:10.409
I WON'T
KEEP BUYING THEM.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.202
YOU GOT TO BE
MORE RESPONSIBLE.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.246
{\an1}DAD, I HAVE TO HAVE
A NEW BOARD.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.625
{\an1}YOU OWN THE STORE--
CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE ONE TO ME?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.001
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.753
YOU COULD WORK IT OFF
BY WASHING DISHES

15:20.836 --> 15:22.921
IN THE SHORE SHACK
FOR ONE WEEK.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.759
COULDN'T YOU JUST RAISE
MY ALLOWANCE?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.093
NO.

15:28.177 --> 15:31.347
{\an1}OH...

15:31.430 --> 15:33.349
OKAY, DAD, YOU'RE ON.

15:34.933 --> 15:36.101
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

15:36.185 --> 15:38.062
{\an1}THAT BOARD DOESN'T
TOUCH THE WATER

15:38.145 --> 15:40.356
UNTIL YOU LEARN
THE VALUE OF HARD WORK.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.149
WHEN WILL THAT BE?

15:42.232 --> 15:45.861
LIKE I SAID, ONE WEEK.

15:45.944 --> 15:47.404
THAT'S A LOT
OF DISHES, CUZ.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.782
(<i> sighs</i> )

15:51.742 --> 15:54.703
I FIGURE
WITH THIS BOARD

15:54.787 --> 15:56.580
I CAN GO PRO
BEFORE THE EIGHTH GRADE.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.831
HEY, YOU GUYS

15:57.915 --> 15:59.708
I THINK YOU'LL WANT
TO SEE THIS SATELLITE IMAGE

15:59.792 --> 16:02.044
I DOWNLOADED OFF THE NET.

16:02.127 --> 16:02.753
WHAT'S THAT GLOB
RIGHT THERE?

16:02.836 --> 16:05.923
THAT'S FROM A JELLY DONUT.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.842
BUT <i> THAT</i> GLOB
IS A BIG SOUTH SWELL.

16:08.926 --> 16:12.221
{\an4}THEY'RE PREDICTING
THE BIGGEST WAVES
OF THE SEASON!

16:12.304 --> 16:16.016
{\an5}PEOPLE OF OTTO,
WE GOT WAVES TO SURF!
COME ON!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.310
GOING SOMEWHERE,
ROCKET BOY?

16:18.394 --> 16:22.898
A BIG SOUTH SWELL IS GOING TO
HIT AND I... WAS... GOING TO...

16:22.981 --> 16:25.901
FINISH THE DISHES, ROCKET BOY.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.445
REMEMBER OUR DEAL... ROCKET BOY.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.406
{\an1}DAD... I'M GOING TO
DO THE WORK.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.533
I'M JUST WAITING
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.911
SAM'S COMPUTER
SAYS I GOT TO GO SURFING!

16:35.994 --> 16:38.038
I HAVE TO! IT'S SCIENCE!

16:38.122 --> 16:39.289
SCIENCE, HUH?

16:39.373 --> 16:43.794
WHY NOT TRY A LITTLE EXPERIMENT
WITH SOAP ON DISHES?!

16:43.877 --> 16:46.213
NO CLEAN DISHES, NO NEW BOARD.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.757
OH, MAN!

16:54.179 --> 16:55.764
ALL RIGHT.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.850
YOU GUYS GO HAVE FUN.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.561
I'LL SEE <i> YOU</i>
IN THE KITCHEN.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.479
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.231
TOUGH BREAK, OTTOMAN.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.942
DON'T EVEN TALK
TO ME, TWISTER.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.069
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.905
WHAT?! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

17:11.989 --> 17:13.991
YEAH? IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE
TO GET BIGGER AIR

17:14.074 --> 17:17.327
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BROKEN
MY BOARD!

17:17.411 --> 17:19.454
THAT'S NOT FAIR, OTTO.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.955
OH, REALLY?

17:21.039 --> 17:23.125
WELL, NEITHER IS ME
HAVING TO DO THE DISHES

17:38.724 --> 17:41.477
{\an1}WHY ARE YOU STACKING
THE DIRTY DISHES?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.979
THEY'RE NOT DIRTY--
I WASHED THEM!

17:44.062 --> 17:45.647

{\an1}OH, MAN!

17:58.076 --> 18:00.996

18:28.315 --> 18:31.151
YEAH, YOU HAVEN'T CALLED ME
SQUID IN OVER AN HOUR.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.987
IT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN
WITHOUT ROCKET BOY.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.322
IT'S STILL FUN.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.490
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.659
I JUST WISH OTTO WAS HERE.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.202
{\an1}I'LL BET HE'S WORKING HARD
RIGHT NOW.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.789

20:47.663 --> 20:49.039
KNOW ABOUT THIS, OTTO?

20:49.122 --> 20:51.333
THE DEAL WAS
I WASH THE DISHES

20:51.416 --> 20:52.542
I GET THE BOARD.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.462
I SAY ONE CLEAN
STACK OF DISHES

20:55.545 --> 20:57.464
GIVES ME ONE HOUR
OF SURF TIME.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.841
{\an5}I LIKE HOW YOUR MIND
WORKS, ROCKET BOY.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.218
{\an1}DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE IT'S WORKING TO ME.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.180
RAYMUNDO'S NOT
GOING TO LIKE THIS.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.182
{\an1}HEY! WHAT'S
A LITTLE SHRIMP LIKE YOU

21:07.265 --> 21:09.476
{\an1}DOING WITH AN EXCELLENT
BOARD LIKE THIS?

21:09.559 --> 21:13.438
IT HAPPENS TO BE THE ONLY BOARD
THAT CAN HANDLE MY MOVES.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.774
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
YOU CAN'T FINISH

21:15.857 --> 21:17.693
ANY OF THOSE
SO-CALLED MOVES!

21:17.776 --> 21:19.403
YEAH? WATCH AND LEARN, LARS.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.114
{\an5}Reggie:
NO, OTTO,
TAKE THE BOARD BACK!

21:23.615 --> 21:26.076
DON'T LET ME DOWN, BABY.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.537
Twister:
THAT WAVE IS HUGE!

21:28.620 --> 21:29.579
HOO...

21:29.663 --> 21:30.706
LOOK HOW FAST HE'S GOING!

21:30.789 --> 21:34.001
All:

21:34.084 --> 21:36.545

THE ALLEY-OOP!

21:36.628 --> 21:38.588
{\an1}WITH A TAIL SLIDE
ON THE SIDE!

21:40.924 --> 21:42.884
HE'S GOING TO WIPE!

21:42.968 --> 21:45.137
WHOA... WHOA...

21:45.220 --> 21:47.889
PLEASE DON'T BREAK THE BOARD.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.101
UH! NOT AGAIN, NOT AGAIN!

21:51.184 --> 21:52.394
YEAH!

21:52.477 --> 21:54.730
(<i> cheering</i> )

21:54.813 --> 21:56.732
HMM, NOT BAD.

21:57.899 --> 22:01.069
{\an5}BET YOU CAN'T WAIT
TO TELL RAYMUNDO,
HUH, OTTO?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.571
(<i> gulps</i> )

22:02.654 --> 22:05.574
RAYMUNDO?

22:05.657 --> 22:07.409
{\an1}WHERE YOU GOING,
ROCKET BOY?

22:07.492 --> 22:08.326
(<i> caws</i> )

22:14.624 --> 22:16.835
THAT IS THE MARCH

22:16.918 --> 22:18.003
OF A CROOKED SEAGULL.

22:18.086 --> 22:18.837
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, OTTO?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.256
I WENT SURFING, DAD.

22:21.339 --> 22:22.924
I'M SORRY.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.093
I'D LIKE TO FINISH
THOSE DISHES NOW

22:25.177 --> 22:26.928
AND <i> EARN</i> THIS NEW BOARD.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.889
I MADE TITO DO THOSE DISHES.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.308
BUT I'M SURE WE COULD
DIRTY SOME UP

22:31.391 --> 22:31.808
FOR YOU TO WASH.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.101
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

22:33.185 --> 22:37.147
(<i> cheering and applause</i> )

22:38.690 --> 22:42.277
AND YOU'LL HAVE <i> TWO</i> WEEKS OF
DISHWASHING TO THINK ABOUT IT.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.445
(<i> yelps</i> )

22:45.363 --> 22:47.157
UH... UH,
LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND

22:47.240 --> 22:49.284
{\an1}WITH THOSE DISHES,
LITTLE BROTHER.

22:49.367 --> 22:50.118
THANKS, TITO.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.205
{\an1}SO, CUZ,
