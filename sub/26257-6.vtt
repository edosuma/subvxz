WEBVTT

00:34.868 --> 00:37.537
I am not a zookeeper.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.706
I am...

01:17.869 --> 01:18.995
Why...

03:15.820 --> 03:19.782
Does the Blue Impulse Custard
Castella Manju go well with coffee?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.993
Or perhaps black tea?

03:23.119 --> 03:25.788
Hasn't that man been coming here
every day?

03:25.872 --> 03:29.042
He always buys local sweets.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.170
They have quite a decent selection.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.432
So the first is cancelled, ey?

03:45.975 --> 03:48.561
I wonder if they're doing well...

03:49.395 --> 03:53.399
Welp, there's nothing I can do
for them anyway.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.484
Here you go.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.903
Have a drink.

03:56.986 --> 03:57.904
Really?

03:58.029 --> 04:00.615
Ooh, the limited hand-picked kiwi flavor!

04:00.823 --> 04:01.783
Did you know

04:02.367 --> 04:06.537
that it is said kiwifruit tastes better
with the skin left on?

04:06.829 --> 04:09.499
Huh? Shouldn't you peel it off?

04:09.958 --> 04:13.836
They say the skin tastes sweeter.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.760
The skin's sweeter, eh?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.182
Wait a moment. Just wait a moment.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.980
Miss, would you so kindly give
that kiwi-flavored Joa to me?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.232
-Huh?
-Not for free of course.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.736
Would you consider trading it for this
Blue Impulse Custard Castella Manju?

04:40.571 --> 04:44.075
Sorry. I'm not a fan of custard.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.620
Nooooo!

04:52.166 --> 04:53.543
I got one!

04:53.710 --> 04:56.004
That's amazing, Amakasu!

04:56.087 --> 05:00.466
Our first catch of protein,
only five days into our survival training.

05:01.676 --> 05:06.139
Just two more days
until we leave our lives here behind.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.475
They've become fast friends.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.228
It doesn't seem like
they want to go home just yet.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.396
But,

05:13.813 --> 05:16.024
F-2 won't play with them.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.234
Just like its pilot.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.862
Even though
the sun's not shining much today,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.948
it must be hot wearing that armor
this whole time, right?

05:24.032 --> 05:26.492
Surely it's burning up.

05:26.701 --> 05:31.205
Wearing that armor is the same
as being cooked on a teppan grill.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.417
Ah!

05:35.043 --> 05:37.045
F-2!

05:38.504 --> 05:40.256
I'm sorry, F-2!

05:40.381 --> 05:42.925
For not realizing it sooner!

05:43.509 --> 05:44.344
Huh?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.096
It's not as hot as I thought.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.639
Wow, you're right.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.726
I wonder if it's some sort
of special metal.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.480
It endures the scorching heat
as if inside a Brazen Bull.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.150
This awkward manliness
is just like that of Ken.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.526
Who is Ken?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.904
Ah, don't mind me.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.448
I'm not sure why,

06:05.531 --> 06:10.411
but it feels like "Ken" would be
a much nicer name than F-2.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.372
Ken,

06:12.497 --> 06:16.501
Hoshino doesn't give you love,
but you still work hard.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.795
It's just so admirable!

06:18.920 --> 06:22.173
I'll lick you in Hoshino's place!

06:26.344 --> 06:27.428
What's wrong?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.138
It's nothing, but...

06:29.263 --> 06:32.225
Morris and Jimmy, could you lick him, too?

06:32.350 --> 06:34.310
You're suddenly calling us
by our TAC names?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.603
Ah! I'm exposed.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.063
Exposed?

06:37.313 --> 06:40.191
We've been together
ever since we came to this island,

06:40.358 --> 06:43.945
so I thought maybe,
since we've gotten a little closer,

06:44.529 --> 06:48.574
it would be okay to be less formal
and use your casual names...

06:48.783 --> 06:50.701
Please, refrain from using my TAC name.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.746
I believe work and private lives
should be separate.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.206
Y-Yeah, you're right...

06:55.373 --> 06:57.125
Please call me Lilikos.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.209
Huh?

06:58.334 --> 07:01.421
R-Really?! I can go straight to
using your nickname?!

07:01.587 --> 07:04.257
So can I be informal
with you, too, Hitomi?!

07:04.340 --> 07:06.092
Uh, yeah.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.012
Okay, okay,
since I enjoy intimacy at work,

07:10.096 --> 07:11.639
please, call me by my TAC name,

07:11.764 --> 07:12.723
Hisone!

07:12.890 --> 07:14.767
There's no difference from before...

07:16.853 --> 07:19.313
It's quite calm down there, isn't it?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.859
Temperature and pressure are dropping,
and thunderclouds are forming.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.277
Everything is on schedule.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.656
Like the yellowtail migration preceding
the winter thunder, as said in Hokuriku.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.869
Hopefully, the girls will become enriched,
as the yellowtail do in winter.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.707
That all depends on what
Senior Master Sergeant Hoshino will do.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.333
Right, Vice-Minister Iiboshi?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.003
I don't like seafood.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.672
Well then, what is your favorite food?

07:44.755 --> 07:47.925
-What's with the easygoing question?
-Right now, it's kiwi.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.015
Looks like it's going to rain.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.559
Aside from that,
what exactly is this place?

07:56.642 --> 08:00.104
For a deserted island,
someone built a pretty fancy torii gate.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.565
What do you think, Nao?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.608
Hisone!

08:04.192 --> 08:06.027
Please take a look at this.

08:07.904 --> 08:08.905
A miniature shrine?

08:09.030 --> 08:12.033
And there is a picture drawn
on that wall over there.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.785
Is that... Masotan?

08:15.161 --> 08:21.375
I thought this island was chosen
for training because it was deserted,

08:21.542 --> 08:23.920
but perhaps there is a different reason.

08:26.964 --> 08:30.218
-There you are.
-What's wrong, Hitomi?

08:30.301 --> 08:33.304
Hitomi? Oh, that's me.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.682
Oh! We have a problem!

08:43.272 --> 08:45.608
She finally finished the raft!

08:45.775 --> 08:48.653
But trying to get past those waves
is madness...

08:49.946 --> 08:53.199
Hoshino! Let's stop for today!

08:53.449 --> 08:55.493
Please come back to shore!

08:58.621 --> 09:02.833
She truly intends to leave Ken behind.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.464
Hoshino!

09:14.095 --> 09:17.139
Hoshino, let's stop, okay?

09:18.474 --> 09:19.392
Leave me alone!

09:21.561 --> 09:22.895
Hoshino...

09:40.496 --> 09:42.498
I guess it won't lit...

09:42.748 --> 09:46.127
We might not be able
to sleep here tonight.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.463
I wonder if Hoshino is okay.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.048
You know...

09:52.300 --> 09:54.302
about Hoshino,

09:54.552 --> 09:57.054
I think she's doing something awful.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.974
Poor Ken.

10:00.474 --> 10:01.309
Hitomi...

10:01.601 --> 10:04.186
And yet, somehow,

10:04.895 --> 10:09.567
I feel bad for Hoshino, too.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.113
I'm going to check on her.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.073
Please wait a moment, Hitomi.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.576
There is a torrential downpour outside.

10:18.659 --> 10:22.288
You'll be entirely soaked
before you know it and catch a cold.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.331
Therefore...

10:24.332 --> 10:25.458
Ba-bam!

10:25.958 --> 10:27.793
Oh, I get it!

10:27.877 --> 10:29.503
Good thinking, Lilikos!

10:29.587 --> 10:32.340
Even if we're soaked,
we'll be fine wearing the suit!

10:38.095 --> 10:40.097
I've never felt so cold!

10:40.181 --> 10:42.975
Thermal conductivity
and osmotic pressure is alarming.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.522
Did you see something on the water?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.399
You don't think that Hoshino...

10:50.900 --> 10:52.568
was washed away?!

10:52.985 --> 10:53.944
Nao!

10:54.862 --> 10:56.072
Nao!

10:56.781 --> 10:58.991
-Hisone!
-Please, let me go!

10:59.075 --> 11:02.078
I just misplaced Nao for a moment!

11:02.620 --> 11:04.121
It's too dangerous!

11:04.413 --> 11:07.249
She's just going back, where she belongs!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.210
Please, Hitomi!

11:09.293 --> 11:12.171
Let me go to her!

11:14.090 --> 11:14.924
Nao...

11:15.466 --> 11:16.467
Nao!

11:16.842 --> 11:18.886
Nao!!

11:23.641 --> 11:25.518
This isn't the time to be crying.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.187
We still haven't found Hoshino.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.523
O-Oh, yeah!

11:30.606 --> 11:33.401
To be worthy,
rescuing survivors comes first!

11:37.530 --> 11:38.656
What's that sound?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.909
This is... an afterburner?

11:42.827 --> 11:44.286
Which means...

11:50.793 --> 11:51.919
Ken?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.308
<i>I've always admired them.</i>

12:07.768 --> 12:09.437
GRADUATION CEREMONY

12:13.357 --> 12:15.109
Wait for me, F-2!

12:23.367 --> 12:26.704
<i>I want to prove to everyone</i>
<i>that I will be an F-2 pilot.</i>

12:27.037 --> 12:28.080
<i>That is the...</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:30.374
<i>reason I am here.</i>

12:56.650 --> 12:57.943
An OTF?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.070
<i>Become one with him.</i>

13:00.529 --> 13:02.364
<i>Fly with him.</i>

13:03.240 --> 13:04.116
<i>That alone is...</i>

13:05.242 --> 13:07.244
<i>the reason why, I was born.</i>

13:14.168 --> 13:15.836
You both saw it too?!

13:15.920 --> 13:16.837
Yes!

13:17.087 --> 13:20.132
There was a cute girl

13:20.257 --> 13:24.553
dressed in old aviation gear
and riding an OTF.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.765
-I can't believe we had the same dream!
-I find it a little creepy.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.642
Hmm? Hoshino!

13:30.392 --> 13:33.145
It's best not to strain yourself.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.648
But the color of your face
looks much better.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.943
Did you guys save me?

13:40.194 --> 13:41.028
Nope.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.864
It wasn't us.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.415
Yesterday, in the pouring rain,

13:54.124 --> 13:57.378
you had been pinned
beneath a pile of wood.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.922
You couldn't move a muscle.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.550
But Ken found you,

14:03.175 --> 14:07.221
and urgently alerted us
about your whereabouts.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.641
Ken is such a good boy.

14:11.100 --> 14:15.479
I felt the roar of the afterburner
reverberate like a punch in the stomach.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.522
That's right.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.648
Who is Ken?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.733
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.318
We're talking about F-2.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.070
He is the manliest of the men.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.991
Don't call him some random name!
You sound like fools!

14:27.074 --> 14:30.661
I didn't join the Air Self-Defense Force
just to babysit an OTF.

14:30.828 --> 14:31.662
Um, Hoshino--

14:31.912 --> 14:34.999
You're satisfied as Dragon Pilots
so you wouldn't understand,

14:35.291 --> 14:38.544
what it means, as a woman,
to dream of being a fighter pilot.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.754
The smallest mistakes aren't forgiven.

14:40.838 --> 14:44.550
Complain just a bit, and behind your back
they'll say women really are limited.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.469
Even so, the reason I could get this far

14:47.636 --> 14:50.639
is because I was determined
to become an F-2 pilot.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.891
And yet...

14:53.767 --> 14:55.102
Why?!

14:55.644 --> 14:58.981
I've tried so hard, so why him?!

14:59.648 --> 15:00.649
I...

15:01.233 --> 15:02.151
wanted to fly...

15:02.359 --> 15:04.862
a real F-2!

15:14.872 --> 15:16.040
Ken!

15:21.420 --> 15:22.713
-It's hot!
-What?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.089
No way. Why?

15:24.632 --> 15:27.134
The heat hasn't been released at all.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.969
It's the afterburner.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.847
To tell us about Hoshino,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.515
he fired it up on the surface.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.896
What can we do?
He might die if this keeps up.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.648
Hurry and take him into the ocean!

15:40.731 --> 15:43.150
Y-Yeah! Ken, change into
Hotel mode quickly!

15:44.693 --> 15:47.655
He won't move, at all!

15:47.738 --> 15:50.282
Hoshino, please say something to Ken!

15:51.742 --> 15:54.662
Ken will only listen
to what you have to say!

15:56.330 --> 15:57.164
He...

15:58.040 --> 16:00.292
doesn't listen to what I say.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.419
That's not true!

16:02.503 --> 16:04.296
-Ken is--
-During the joint training,

16:05.506 --> 16:08.217
he... disregarded my orders,

16:08.759 --> 16:10.761
and embarrassed me.

16:11.512 --> 16:12.763
That's it!

16:13.347 --> 16:14.390
Hisone?

16:14.473 --> 16:15.933
What's with the innocent voice?

16:16.016 --> 16:19.520
So that's why he forces himself
to stay as a fighter jet.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.646
Huh?

16:20.729 --> 16:22.606
W-What are you talking about?

16:22.690 --> 16:27.194
It's Ken's answer to Hoshino's wish
to become the first penguin.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.156
That's the reason he's been like that.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.117
I see!

16:33.242 --> 16:35.411
It seems there's some truth to that.

16:35.536 --> 16:40.416
But even on this deserted island,
he maintains his constricted Foxtrot mode.

16:40.916 --> 16:44.336
If OTF do not release their heat,
they cannot live.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.713
That's why Ken...

16:46.338 --> 16:50.968
secretly swam in the ocean
when no one was watching.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.221
How did you know that?

16:54.346 --> 16:57.307
When I licked Ken, he was salty.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.184
It was seawater!

17:00.019 --> 17:02.938
You went that far, Ken?

17:03.814 --> 17:04.690
Hoshino!

17:05.190 --> 17:06.442
Even during the training,

17:06.525 --> 17:10.612
Ken probably overheated
from working too hard!

17:11.071 --> 17:12.865
No matter what happens to Ken,

17:12.948 --> 17:15.117
he just wants to be
what you want, Hoshino!

17:15.200 --> 17:16.535
That's all it is!

17:17.119 --> 17:19.538
Please persuade him, Hoshino!

17:19.747 --> 17:21.040
-Ken is--
-Shut up!

17:22.583 --> 17:24.293
Don't make me say it over and over.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.046
Do not call him Ken!

17:27.379 --> 17:29.339
You're still saying that?

17:50.152 --> 17:50.986
Hoshino!

17:51.070 --> 17:53.197
Oh no! You'll get burned!

17:53.280 --> 17:54.782
You fool.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.535
You are not a plane.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.703
You're a dragon.

18:00.704 --> 18:04.041
You don't need to look like this for me.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.586
You don't need to strain yourself anymore.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.215
It's okay to show your true self.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.008
So...

18:14.468 --> 18:15.344
don't die,

18:15.469 --> 18:16.303
Norma!

18:50.045 --> 18:51.296
<i>It's warm in here...</i>

18:54.299 --> 18:57.469
<i>even though it was</i>
<i>burning on the outside.</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:06.061
<i>The first time Norma</i>
<i>swallowed me and we flew,</i>

19:06.311 --> 19:07.521
<i>I was bewildered.</i>

19:08.522 --> 19:09.523
<i>But...</i>

19:12.943 --> 19:14.319
<i>my heart was dancing.</i>

19:14.736 --> 19:16.321
<i>It was beating out of my chest,</i>

19:16.405 --> 19:19.032
<i>enough to make me forget</i>
<i>my fixation on becoming a pilot.</i>

19:20.409 --> 19:21.827
<i>It was just delightful.</i>

19:24.204 --> 19:25.038
<i>That's right.</i>

19:25.622 --> 19:27.416
<i>You aren't an F-2.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:30.002
<i>I knew that from the start.</i>

19:32.504 --> 19:34.173
<i>Will you still...</i>

19:35.007 --> 19:36.300
<i>fly for me?</i>

19:41.138 --> 19:43.307
<i>Thank you... Norma.</i>

20:13.128 --> 20:14.838
What's gotten into you?

20:14.922 --> 20:16.757
They seem happy.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.760
Masotan, do you want to fly too?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.514
Magnificent!

20:24.973 --> 20:28.644
El Hoshino has flipped on
the last switch for us after all.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.521
By realizing their love toward the OTF,

20:31.647 --> 20:33.523
the White Lovers have become as one.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.068
This is good indeed.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.529
It seems the Vice-Minister has gotten
the bounce in his step back.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.325
This has also produced another outcome.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.001
It's beautiful, isn't it, Norma?

20:54.044 --> 20:55.837
<i>Um, Hoshino.</i>

20:56.338 --> 21:00.509
<i>Is it possible that Norma is</i>
<i>Ken's real name?</i>

21:00.592 --> 21:01.927
<i>Why did you choose that name?</i>

21:02.678 --> 21:04.304
-<i>Because it's an F-2.</i>
<i>-</i>Huh?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.724
F-2, eff-two, <i>futsu.</i>

21:08.016 --> 21:10.686
<i>Futsu</i> means "normal" in English.
Hence the name Norma.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.691
<i>That wordplay is way too cool</i>
<i>to be a dad joke.</i>

21:15.816 --> 21:18.443
<i>Norma is such a lovely name.</i>

21:18.777 --> 21:20.654
<i>It fits perfectly.</i>

21:20.737 --> 21:26.159
<i>So does that mean that in your heart,</i>
<i>you called it Norma instead of F-2?</i>

21:27.995 --> 21:29.788
<i>Let's go, Norma!</i>

21:30.497 --> 21:32.499
<i>Ah! She's flying away!</i>

21:41.633 --> 21:43.218
They're back.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.346
Thank goodness.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.865
With this, we can now set our sights
on the incoming government,

22:05.157 --> 22:08.493
and take our first step into training.

22:09.328 --> 22:14.624
From now on, I would like your cooperation
in reporting any information.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.542
Huh?

22:15.625 --> 22:18.170
We have not tried to conceal
anything from you, sir.

22:18.962 --> 22:19.796
No.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.966
You concealed a very important
piece of information...

22:26.094 --> 22:28.180
the presence of the Joa lady.

22:39.107 --> 22:42.319
Seeing their smug little faces
pisses me off...

22:43.403 --> 22:45.530
Hey! Give me back my head!

22:45.614 --> 22:46.907
Nao!

22:47.199 --> 22:49.910
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.500 --> 24:21.501
<i>Love.</i>

24:22.711 --> 24:24.045
<i>Love.</i>

24:25.338 --> 24:26.173
<i>Love.</i>

24:30.385 --> 24:31.303
<i>It's delicious!</i>

24:41.813 --> 24:44.900
