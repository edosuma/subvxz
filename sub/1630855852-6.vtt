00:03.873 --> 00:05.657
<i>Previously on "Quantum Leap"...</i>

00:05.657 --> 00:08.138
I found something seriously
wrong with the quantum

00:08.138 --> 00:09.748
processing chip
that your boss built for me.

00:09.748 --> 00:13.143
The chip is transmitting
Ziggy's code out of HQ,

00:13.143 --> 00:14.275
presumably back to him.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.493
You're with someone else.

00:15.493 --> 00:16.886
<i>We'll get through
it together.</i>

00:16.886 --> 00:19.019
You're Agent Robert Cook
from Project Sign.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.324
Hannah, is it?

00:20.324 --> 00:22.065
I believe in all kinds
of impossible things.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.936
You try explaining a yo-yo
to somebody

00:23.936 --> 00:25.112
who doesn't know what they are.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.201
Centrifugal force,
angular momentum,

00:27.201 --> 00:28.767
that would have been
considered witchcraft

00:28.767 --> 00:31.553
a hundred years ago.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.297
Henry!

00:36.297 --> 00:39.082
It's me, Lawrence.

00:39.082 --> 00:42.172
Thank God.
Thank God you're here.

00:42.172 --> 00:43.869
You're bleeding.
What happened?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.092
Someone found me.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.746
They thought I had the formula.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.791
You're going to be OK.
Just breathe.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.141
He had cold blue eyes.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.577
Help!

00:55.577 --> 00:56.882
We need help!

00:56.882 --> 00:58.362
Henry, it's real.

00:58.362 --> 01:02.105
You have to find it
before they can.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.499
We're going
to find it together, OK?

01:04.499 --> 01:06.892
Just hold on.
Hold on, Lawrence.

01:06.892 --> 01:10.113
Path... finder.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.114
Lawrence.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.768
Lawrence!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.945
Lawrence!

01:15.945 --> 01:18.382
Has anybody seen Magic?
He's not in his office.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.123
Uh, he's taking
a personal day.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.646
Magic doesn't
take personal days.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.083
Maybe that last leap
shook him up.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.128
I mean, after everything
he's been through, you know?

01:25.128 --> 01:27.391
I spoke to him.
He's doing fine.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.219
In the meantime,
we need a schedule to decide

01:29.219 --> 01:31.047
who's next on hologram duty.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.831
One, two, three.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.181
- Yes!
- God, dang it!

01:34.181 --> 01:36.008
Why do I keep losing?
- Ian, always go paper.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.923
That's not how statistical
probability works.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.534
- Eh.
- It's not.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.883
Oh, look, I got him.

01:40.883 --> 01:42.624
I got him.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.454
What happened?

01:46.454 --> 01:49.196
I don't--I don't know.
I just had a signal.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.980
Ian, did we lose him?

01:50.980 --> 01:53.243
Like "lose him" lose him?
No, no, no, no.

01:53.243 --> 01:56.159
This looks like it's
an internal system error.

02:00.511 --> 02:05.429
Uh, I am going to go
and check the backup servers.

02:05.429 --> 02:08.737
But I will be right back.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.652
<i>You move fast
when you want to.</i>

02:10.652 --> 02:12.436
So will security
once I tell them.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.829
<i>You're not going
to do that, Ian,</i>

02:13.829 --> 02:15.265
not when I'm your
only chance of getting

02:15.265 --> 02:16.440
your system back online.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.963
Look, what do you want?

02:17.963 --> 02:20.227
My employer provided
a prototype under the condition

02:20.227 --> 02:23.578
that you would share any data
you collected while using it.

02:23.578 --> 02:26.407
I will deliver
what I promised, OK?

02:26.407 --> 02:29.192
But right now I need
that quantum chip reactivated.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.367
It is an emergency.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.716
<i>I'd love to help,</i>

02:31.716 --> 02:33.544
but the chip requires
authorization codes

02:33.544 --> 02:35.329
every 24 hours to stay active.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.069
And seeing as how
you locked us out--

02:37.069 --> 02:38.767
You were stealing data.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.464
No, we were
collecting that which

02:40.464 --> 02:42.292
we were entitled to collect.

02:42.292 --> 02:45.730
<i>You made the deal, Ian.</i>

02:45.730 --> 02:46.992
<i>How about this?</i>

02:46.992 --> 02:49.081
Tell me we have an agreement.

02:49.081 --> 02:52.172
And as a show of good faith,
I'll reactivate the chip

02:52.172 --> 02:54.826
for the rest of the day.

02:54.826 --> 02:58.265
Well, you're a long way from
California, Professor McCoy.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.049
You're also the last one
to see the victim alive.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.138
I told you,
Professor Lawrence had already

03:02.138 --> 03:03.531
been attacked when I got here.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.489
He said the killer
had cold blue eyes.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.665
Oh, they were cold.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.232
Well, that helps
narrow it down.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.147
See, what I still
don't understand is what you

03:11.147 --> 03:13.976
were doing on campus alone
at 4:00 in the morning.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.021
Sorry I'm late.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.284
Technical difficulties.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.547
Mr. McCoy,
you got any communist ties?

03:19.547 --> 03:21.157
What?

03:21.157 --> 03:23.246
Oh, uh...

03:23.246 --> 03:25.379
Oh, he's barking up
the wrong tree.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.511
Before he became a professor,
Sergeant McCoy

03:27.511 --> 03:29.078
served in the Eighth
Airborne Division

03:29.078 --> 03:31.428
during World War II,
multiple tours in Normandy.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.690
Mr. McCoy--

03:32.690 --> 03:34.692
You can address me
as Sergeant.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.999
I earned that distinction
after serving in Normandy.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.567
Where did you serve?
- Dairy Queen, apparently.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.959
We appreciate your service.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.613
But that doesn't change
the fact that you're

03:42.613 --> 03:44.354
a material witness
to a homicide.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.356
I'm gonna ask you
not to leave town.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.358
- Is that all?
- For now.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.884
Ooh.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.190
Normandy.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.800
Huh.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.976
Welcome
to Princeton, New Jersey.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.500
It's 1955.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.198
You're a visiting physics
professor and already a suspect

04:02.198 --> 04:03.243
in an unsolved murder.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.420
Wait a minute.
Princeton, 1955?

04:06.420 --> 04:08.813
Jenn, we are
in the most exciting place

04:08.813 --> 04:11.860
at the most exciting time
in American scientific history.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.557
All of the greatest minds
are working

04:13.557 --> 04:15.298
here right now, including--

04:16.734 --> 04:18.606
Albert Einstein, your hero.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.042
We know.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.913
You've ruined many a lunch
with your dissertations

04:21.913 --> 04:23.480
on the Father of Space--

04:23.480 --> 04:25.787
Spacetime, relativity,
quantum entanglement.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.050
Einstein is the reason
I fell in love with physics

04:28.050 --> 04:29.356
in the first place.

04:29.356 --> 04:32.272
And I have a chance
to meet him.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.012
Oh, I'm sorry, Ben.

04:34.012 --> 04:37.320
It's May 15th.
Einstein died a month ago.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.756
Oh.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.758
Hold up,
that might be related

04:40.758 --> 04:41.977
to the reason why you're here.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.587
Einstein's death?

04:43.587 --> 04:45.372
It seems the late
Professor Lawrence wrote

04:45.372 --> 04:46.895
several letters
to Professor McCoy--

04:46.895 --> 04:48.766
that's you--
asking you to help him

04:48.766 --> 04:50.899
look for a missing formula
that was created

04:50.899 --> 04:52.770
by Albert Einstein.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.251
Jenn, no,
I've read every single paper

04:55.251 --> 04:57.471
published by Albert Einstein,
every historical record,

04:57.471 --> 04:58.950
every biography.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.952
And there's nothing
about some missing formula.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.041
Maybe he was working
on a top-secret project.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.348
- Come on, what are the ch--
- Professor McCoy?

05:05.348 --> 05:08.351
We're with the Atomic
Energy Commission.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.266
Would you come with us, please?

05:10.266 --> 05:11.441
Am I under arrest?

05:11.441 --> 05:13.400
Quite the opposite.

05:15.140 --> 05:18.448
We need your help.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.363
Is that who I think it is?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.149
Yeah.

05:35.465 --> 05:38.207
Is she another leaper?
Like Martinez?

05:38.207 --> 05:41.079
We're not detecting
a quantum anomaly, no.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.343
That's Hannah Carson,
the woman you met in New Mexico

05:43.343 --> 05:46.128
six years ago, the one you told
to come here to Princeton.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.608
What are the odds
of me crossing paths

05:47.608 --> 05:49.653
with the same person
in two different leaps?

05:49.653 --> 05:51.612
I mean, I'm not Ian,
so I don't have, like,

05:51.612 --> 05:52.961
a weirdly exact number for you.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.659
But I'd say the odds
are crazy slim.

05:55.659 --> 05:59.359
Maybe the accelerator just
decided you needed a friend.

06:00.534 --> 06:03.014
We'll take it from here.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.321
Professor Lawrence
said we could trust you.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.018
It goes without saying,
everything you see here

06:07.018 --> 06:09.978
is highly classified.

06:09.978 --> 06:12.459
Jenn, this is
project Matterhorn,

06:12.459 --> 06:14.678
the government program
that conducted top-secret

06:14.678 --> 06:16.158
thermonuclear research.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.855
I was just about to tell
you that.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.466
Wait, why am I whispering?

06:19.466 --> 06:22.817
Professor, ready
for a glimpse of the future?

06:28.300 --> 06:31.782
The future's
a steampunk hamster maze?

06:33.697 --> 06:35.960
The stellarator.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.050
I remember reading about this.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.617
In letters.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.706
Lawrence told me you were
working on the cutting edge

06:42.706 --> 06:44.273
of nuclear fusion.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.492
Yes.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.668
These twisting magnetic coils
allow us

06:47.668 --> 06:50.497
to stimulate plasma particles
that could,

06:50.497 --> 06:53.587
in theory, generate limitless
clean energy one day.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.547
Do you have the time?

06:57.547 --> 06:58.853
Yeah.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.768
Oh.

07:00.768 --> 07:01.943
Ah.

07:04.249 --> 07:05.816
Sorry, that never gets old.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.296
No, this is--oh.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.385
You'll have to excuse
my research assistant.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.953
She is a kid in a candy store.

07:11.953 --> 07:15.696
I'm Dr. Karl Donovan, project
supervisor here at Matterhorn.

07:15.696 --> 07:19.395
Thank you for coming under
such trying circumstances,

07:19.395 --> 07:20.527
Professor McCoy.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.006
Professor Lawrence
was a good man.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.834
I'm so sorry for your loss.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.836
Sit, please.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.712
That will be all, Ms. Carson.

07:35.411 --> 07:38.675
I'm under the impression
Lawrence confided

07:38.675 --> 07:42.026
in you a great deal,
including his search

07:42.026 --> 07:43.419
for Einstein's formula.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.943
- Told you so.
- He did mention it to me.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.119
But he was vague on specifics.

07:48.119 --> 07:51.688
Before he died,
Einstein had thrown himself

07:51.688 --> 07:55.431
into solving the problems
of nuclear fusion.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.347
- Of which there are many.
- And he solved them.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.957
He did?

07:59.957 --> 08:04.179
Yes, Einstein sketched out
a formula days before he died.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.921
But it was thought
this work perished with him.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.531
Until Lawrence
found the clue,

08:08.531 --> 08:10.533
which is when he
reached out to me.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.449
Whatever it was,
Lawrence never shared it

08:13.449 --> 08:15.320
with any of us at Matterhorn.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.409
He was waiting for you.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.629
Unfortunately,
someone else got to him first.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.544
"They thought
I had the formula."

08:21.544 --> 08:23.111
That's what he said
before he died.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.417
Professor McCoy,
the public at large

08:25.417 --> 08:29.465
may not know what we
do here at Matterhorn.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.555
But I assure you
our enemies do.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.297
Soviet spies have been
circling this project

08:35.297 --> 08:36.777
for quite some time.

08:36.777 --> 08:39.301
I don't have to tell
you that if the Soviets

08:39.301 --> 08:42.870
find that formula,
they will gain

08:42.870 --> 08:44.654
limitless power overnight.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.004
And the United States
will be quite

08:47.004 --> 08:49.093
literally left in the dark.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.139
Do you think you can locate it?

08:51.139 --> 08:53.054
McCoy failed
in the original timeline.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.230
But Ziggy says
there's a 97% chance

08:55.230 --> 08:56.797
you're here to finish the job.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.189
Lawrence was my friend.

08:58.189 --> 09:01.279
And Einstein has
been my obsession.

09:04.587 --> 09:08.069
If that formula's here,
I'll find it.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.648
You can't do that.
Fellows only.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.695
Relax.
I just saved you a day's work.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.567
What was that about?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.264
NAS fellowships.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.005
It's a total boys' club.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.572
They sit around
all day pretending

09:32.572 --> 09:35.139
to be brilliant and collect
fat research grants.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.620
Right,
National Academy of Sciences.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.361
I'm guessing women
like yourself are--

09:39.361 --> 09:41.842
Passed over repeatedly.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.278
But my day will come.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.845
In the meantime,
if you need any help getting

09:44.845 --> 09:46.673
around campus, I am available.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.979
I'm finishing a paper,
but otherwise.

09:48.979 --> 09:50.372
Huh.
What are you researching?

09:50.372 --> 09:52.679
Untangling the theory
of quantum entanglement.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.289
Donovan's going to help me
get it published

09:54.289 --> 09:55.464
at the end of this quarter.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.727
Bye-bye, boys' club.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.555
That's great, Hannah.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.646
Did I tell you my name?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.865
Hm?

10:04.865 --> 10:06.693
Uh, I--

10:06.693 --> 10:10.610
Professor Lawrence wrote
about you in his letters.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.221
He said you were
quite brilliant.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.049
Apparently,
you're from New Mexico?

10:15.049 --> 10:20.097
Yeah,
it's a crazy story actually.

10:20.097 --> 10:24.232
Um, anyway,
I'm here if you need me.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.713
Good luck, Professor McCoy.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.279
Thanks.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.807
Ben, I'm looking
at that paper she mentioned.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.243
Hannah's name isn't on it.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.158
In fact, it's not on anything
that was published.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.507
She works for Donovan
for years,

10:38.507 --> 10:39.813
and he just keeps
taking the credit.

10:39.813 --> 10:42.032
To hell with that.

10:42.032 --> 10:43.599
Come again?

10:43.599 --> 10:47.298
I said I could use your help
with that--this,

10:47.298 --> 10:50.127
my search
for Einstein's formula.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.042
It would be
in an official capacity.

10:52.042 --> 10:55.742
We would share the credit
for any discoveries made 50/50.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.700
Two birds, one stone.
I like this plan.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.485
You want to share
credit with me?

11:00.485 --> 11:01.835
You don't even know me.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.054
Well, fair is fair.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.622
And like I said,
Lawrence was a fan.

11:06.622 --> 11:09.843
So I figure it might
help open some doors.

11:11.192 --> 11:14.238
Yeah, it would
open every door.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.675
Thank you.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.415
I, uh...

11:17.415 --> 11:20.462
I just--Professor,
this is going to sound strange.

11:20.462 --> 11:23.247
But have we met before?

11:25.075 --> 11:27.469
No, no.

11:27.469 --> 11:30.690
No, just one of those faces.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.303
OK then.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.740
This formula,
where do you want to start?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.351
Lawrence wrote to me
that he found a clue

11:40.351 --> 11:41.831
about the formula's location.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.834
But I have no idea
where this clue could be.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.663
Hm, you want
my scientific opinion?

11:47.663 --> 11:50.622
- Please.
- We search his apartment.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.625
Genius.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.627
Uh, is anybody else's
brain melting

11:55.627 --> 11:57.107
with the possibilities here?

11:57.107 --> 11:59.936
I mean, if Ben discovers
the secret to fusion in 1955,

11:59.936 --> 12:02.591
won't that massively change
the course of the 20th century?

12:02.591 --> 12:05.376
No more gas pumps.
No more global warming.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.987
Magic picked a hell
of a day to take off.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.511
This is the butterfly effect
to end all butterfly effects.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.339
Our cars could be flying
by the time this is over.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.819
Let's forget
the flying cars and focus

12:12.819 --> 12:15.430
on helping Ben, starting with,
who else is looking

12:15.430 --> 12:17.345
for that formula in 1955?

12:17.345 --> 12:19.695
Where's Ian?

12:19.695 --> 12:21.392
They're trying
to figure out what caused

12:21.392 --> 12:23.003
that glitch this morning.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.005
OK, OK, I can do this.

12:25.005 --> 12:28.704
I will start looking through
the old intelligence archives

12:28.704 --> 12:34.797
and see what I can find
on Russian spies at Princeton.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.408
Is it weird seeing
your old stomping grounds?

12:37.408 --> 12:39.671
I didn't go
until 50 years later.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.804
A lot had changed by then.

12:41.804 --> 12:45.242
Yeah, but, I mean, it's still
got to bring back memories.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.462
Let me know
if Ben finds anything.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.604
Someone's a step ahead of us.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.781
Well, if Lawrence found
something important,

13:01.781 --> 13:02.956
he would have
hidden it somewhere

13:02.956 --> 13:04.392
only you could find it.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.829
Any ideas?

13:11.834 --> 13:16.230
We served together.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.101
Lawrence talked about you.

13:18.101 --> 13:21.148
He told me you saved his life.

13:21.148 --> 13:24.412
Is that how you were injured?

13:24.412 --> 13:26.588
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

13:26.588 --> 13:29.721
That was none of my business.

13:29.721 --> 13:32.463
Ben, I'm looking at Lawrence
and McCoy's military records.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.771
The Eighth Airborne Division
had a code name.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.947
Path... finder.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.428
Pathfinder.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.525
That's German for "solitude."

13:50.525 --> 13:52.788
And that's Al's handwriting.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.398
Hang on, did you just refer

13:54.398 --> 13:56.357
to the Father of Relativity
as "Al"?

13:56.357 --> 13:57.749
You knew him?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.751
Well, we only met
a few times, but yes.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.537
He was quite fun actually.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.801
Wait, I recognize this window.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.324
Oh, no, Ben.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.326
It's in the physics library.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.546
Einstein's telling us
where to look.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.895
Hannah, this is fantastic.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.723
Opposite.
Opposite of fantastic.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.638
Finding that clue just
altered the entire timeline.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.379
Come on, I'll take you there.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.120
Ben, Hannah's
going to die tonight.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.949
Professor, you coming?

14:30.347 --> 14:33.568
Well,
we're in the right place.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.787
Maybe the formula
is in one of the books?

14:35.787 --> 14:37.441
No wonder Lawrence
needed my help.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.617
Needle, meet haystack.

14:39.617 --> 14:43.230
I'm sorry, this section
of the library is closed.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.449
Oh, Professor McCoy is...

14:45.449 --> 14:46.886
Ben?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.452
Here on behalf of
the Atomic Energy Commission.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.845
If you could just
give us 15 minutes?

14:49.845 --> 14:51.281
How does she die?

14:51.281 --> 14:52.935
Apparently, there's,
like, a freak lab accident

14:52.935 --> 14:54.719
at project Matterhorn tonight.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.113
The reports indicate
that Hannah was conducting

14:57.113 --> 14:58.549
some kind of experiment.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.203
The entire building
went up in flames.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.509
Then I'm calling
off the search.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.771
No, you can't.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.164
Ziggy says our best chances
of you leaping

15:04.164 --> 15:05.817
are to find that formula.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.210
Besides,
you call off the search now,

15:07.210 --> 15:08.820
and Hannah still dies
in the accident.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.475
Tell Ziggy
that makes no sense.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.738
I asked for her help.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.306
So whatever happens
to her is my responsibility.

15:16.306 --> 15:19.135
Ben, hey,
it's going to be OK.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.659
We'll fix this.
You know that, right?

15:23.879 --> 15:25.315
What's going on?

15:25.315 --> 15:27.361
I think she
remembers me, Jenn.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.276
I know I'm in a different body.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.975
But when she looks at me,
it's like she knows who I am.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.979
You brought your phone in here?

15:36.979 --> 15:40.548
Yeah, I need to,
uh, step out for a bit.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.724
Just find that formula.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.508
And keep Hannah away
from the building tonight, OK?

15:44.508 --> 15:45.857
I'll be back
before you know it.

15:45.857 --> 15:46.989
Jenn--

15:46.989 --> 15:48.556
There you are.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.993
OK, I bought us some time.
Where do you want to start?

15:50.993 --> 15:52.995
Uh, alphabetically?

15:54.779 --> 15:57.043
OK, let's go.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.047
Jenn?

16:01.047 --> 16:03.179
Is everything OK?

16:03.179 --> 16:04.789
There's a security issue.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.313
Not even an issue, really--
a thing.

16:06.313 --> 16:09.881
Let's call it a thing
I need to attend to.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.709
I might be a second.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.898
So I take it that wasn't
a random glitch this morning.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.639
No, we are
in serious trouble.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.163
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's setting

16:30.163 --> 16:31.294
off my security alarms.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.948
I know, OK?
I'm freaking out.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.037
I don't know what to do.
- Hey.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.908
You can't fix this on your own.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.693
You don't have to.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.739
You know who you need
to talk to, right?

16:41.739 --> 16:43.915
Yeah.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.830
I know.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.746
<i>♪ Papa loves mambo</i>

16:48.746 --> 16:51.967
<i>♪ Mama loves mambo</i>

16:51.967 --> 16:54.926
<i>♪ Look at 'em sway with it,
getting so gay with it ♪</i>

16:54.926 --> 16:57.581
<i>♪ Shouting olé with it, wow</i>

16:57.581 --> 16:59.279
Nothing.

16:59.279 --> 17:03.500
Come on, Albert,
where did you hide this thing?

17:03.500 --> 17:06.025
Professor,
we're running out of time.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.766
OK, you went there.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.421
Do you have any idea where
they should be looking?

17:11.421 --> 17:12.988
Actually, yes.

17:12.988 --> 17:15.730
Tell them to search
the second floor.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.254
I can't go back in there.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.952
Ben made it very clear
that he does not want me

17:20.952 --> 17:23.520
as his hologram right now.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.608
Magic's gone.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.002
Ian's busy,
and Jenn's doing--

17:27.002 --> 17:29.483
something, so...

17:32.790 --> 17:33.878
No, bad idea.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.446
No, it's a terrible idea.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.797
Do you have a better one?

17:47.675 --> 17:48.763
Hi, Ben.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.983
Tom Westfall,
Department of Defense.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.989
Right, sorry.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.513
I'm pinch-hitting for Jenn.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.558
She's tied up.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.219
Thank you, but no thank you.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.481
I don't need your help.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.136
You can send anyone,
literally anyone else.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.572
We don't have anyone else.

18:15.572 --> 18:18.314
Look, I know
this is awkward as hell.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.924
But I was a student here.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.883
I think I can help you find
what you're looking for.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.102
Oh, really?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.668
Did you find
a 50-year-old formula

18:24.668 --> 18:26.714
while you and your friends
were playing beer pong in here?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.107
No.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.719
But I did find a secret room
on the second floor.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.156
I'm going to hate it
if you're right.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.376
What are we looking for?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.682
Legend has it
that back in the 1800s,

18:38.682 --> 18:40.293
there were secret
societies who would

18:40.293 --> 18:42.425
meet inside this library.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.167
Apparently, they built a hidden
chamber into the foundation.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.474
And Al wrote "solitude"
under his sketch.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.084
So maybe he was
working somewhere

18:49.084 --> 18:50.216
no one could find him.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.043
This is it.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.572
Let's try pulling some
of these books.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.578
Wait, was it this wall?

19:06.275 --> 19:07.320
It's up here somewhere.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.235
Maybe we should split up.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.890
How do you forget
a secret room?

19:12.890 --> 19:15.545
It was college.
We weren't in our right minds.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.374
<i>Oh, you mean
you were up here getting high</i>

19:18.374 --> 19:19.854
<i>with your frat buddies.</i>

19:19.854 --> 19:22.683
<i>No, I was getting high
with my future wife.</i>

19:22.683 --> 19:24.815
<i>What?
Wait, you're married?</i>

19:24.815 --> 19:26.208
OK, false alarm.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.123
We're all goo--whoa.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.473
Is Tom in with Ben?

19:30.473 --> 19:31.605
I thought you
were with Addison.

19:31.605 --> 19:35.913
Yeah, and it is
going great so far.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.046
My wife died six years ago.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.874
Cancer.

19:39.874 --> 19:44.095
Do you mind if we get back
to trying to find this formula?

19:44.095 --> 19:46.185
Professor?

19:48.709 --> 19:52.452
Now we're looking
in the right place.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.932
Let me try something.

19:59.110 --> 20:01.504
It's on the other side.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.593
The access point must change
in the next 50 years.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.116
That's why I couldn't find it.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.423
OK, if I were
Albert Einstein,

20:07.423 --> 20:09.773
how would I open a secret door?

20:13.603 --> 20:14.909
Hannah, what time do you have?

20:14.909 --> 20:15.953
4:30.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.259
Me too.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.956
This clock is
three minutes fast.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.828
Time is relative.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.275
After you.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.763
Cozy.

20:42.763 --> 20:45.635
Wait, that's Al's.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.898
He used to bring it
into the Matterhorn offices.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.204
It's in German.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.510
But I can translate it.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.338
Can I get some more light?
- Yeah.

21:00.346 --> 21:01.912
What does it say?

21:01.912 --> 21:03.479
Ben, I've got
a blue-eyed Caucasian male

21:03.479 --> 21:05.002
coming this way,
and he has a knife.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.526
- Someone's coming.
- How do you know that?

21:06.526 --> 21:08.528
When he comes through
the door, grab his wrist,

21:08.528 --> 21:09.964
and redirect the knife
into his shoulder.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.400
I don't know how
to do that, remember?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.662
I'm not a soldier.
- Yes, you are.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.055
Why are you saying that?
- Ben, look out.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.713
Ah!

21:22.324 --> 21:25.022
Give me the book,
or you both die.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.459
OK.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.121
McCoy!

21:54.835 --> 21:56.184
You OK?

21:56.184 --> 21:57.968
Yeah.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.622
We have to get out of here.
Grab his legs.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.102
Ben?

22:01.102 --> 22:03.539
The journal.
- Oh, the journal.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.374
OK.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.375
Call 911.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.637
9-1-what?

22:14.637 --> 22:16.030
Dial the operator.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.728
Tell them we need police
and fire here immediately.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.556
How did you know
he was coming?

22:20.556 --> 22:22.471
My Army training.

22:22.471 --> 22:26.257
I could hear his boots
coming from a mile away.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.781
OK.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.614
Looks like old blue eyes
here might be

22:34.614 --> 22:37.268
the man who killed Lawrence.

22:37.268 --> 22:40.533
Ben, I'm not sure
you're dealing with Russians.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.058
- You did great.
- Really?

22:44.058 --> 22:46.408
The timeline just updated.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.063
Thanks to Ben and Hannah,
Klaus Erickson

22:49.063 --> 22:50.499
was charged and convicted
in the murder

22:50.499 --> 22:51.674
of Professor Lawrence.

22:51.674 --> 22:52.980
A lifetime sentence.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.547
Klaus Erickson,
what do we know about him?

22:54.547 --> 22:55.939
He's German.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.811
Came from Berlin
to the U.S. on a chemical

22:57.811 --> 22:59.856
engineering scholarship.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.423
Any tattoos?

23:01.423 --> 23:02.816
Yeah, actually.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.341
That is a Nazi symbol.

23:06.341 --> 23:09.649
Wait, the Nazis
are after this formula?

23:09.649 --> 23:11.085
Aren't we
in the wrong decade?

23:11.085 --> 23:12.913
Do a deep dive
on Operation Paperclip.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.436
I'm going to call the DOD.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.699
And I'll get everything declassified.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.093
Operation Paperclip?

23:19.093 --> 23:22.444
After World War II, the
United States went to Germany

23:22.444 --> 23:26.100
and recruited thousands
of scientists and engineers

23:26.100 --> 23:27.971
to serve American interests.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.712
We gave the Nazis jobs?

23:29.712 --> 23:31.105
On U.S. soil.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.760
Hang on.
You said there were thousands.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.719
That means we have no idea
how many Ben is up against.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.462
Yes, sir.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.290
Thank you, General.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.118
We should have access
to the files soon.

23:44.118 --> 23:47.034
Hey, I heard you
tell Ben about Kate.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.515
I'm so sorry.

23:49.515 --> 23:52.126
I did not think
about that when

23:52.126 --> 23:53.083
I asked you to go in there.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.258
It was the right call.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.870
Besides, it's just a place.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.699
Hey.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.484
Look, when I lost Ben,

24:02.484 --> 24:04.704
hearing
about your grieving process

24:04.704 --> 24:09.099
really helped me
through my own.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.927
But since we've been together,

24:10.927 --> 24:14.496
you've stopped talking
about Kate.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.585
I want you
to know that you can,

24:16.585 --> 24:19.632
especially when you're
walking around the place

24:19.632 --> 24:21.111
where you two met.

24:21.111 --> 24:24.158
I appreciate that.

24:24.158 --> 24:28.467
But if I don't, it's just
because we're on mission.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.339
And it doesn't help me
to focus on the past right now.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.385
OK.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.524
Mind if I fix myself a drink?

24:42.524 --> 24:44.787
It's not every day
someone tries to kill me.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.529
Can you make that two?

24:47.529 --> 24:50.140
Sure.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.533
How's the German coming?

24:51.533 --> 24:53.709
Oh, it's incredible.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.626
Einstein's writing
about his dreams, his fears.

24:57.626 --> 25:01.543
It's like being inside that
big, beautiful brain of his.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.677
God, I wanted
to be just like him.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.243
Me too.

25:12.511 --> 25:16.558
To Al.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.910
Read me something
from the journal.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.564
OK.

25:22.564 --> 25:26.263
Well, Al was wrestling
with some premonitions.

25:26.263 --> 25:30.354
"Mankind's innovations,
absent of conscience,

25:30.354 --> 25:33.314
only brings us closer
to catastrophe."

25:33.314 --> 25:35.882
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

25:35.882 --> 25:38.014
Hmm.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.407
That's funny.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.714
This entire page
is written in Greek.

25:41.714 --> 25:42.932
Oh.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.586
Looks like it's
some kind of poem?

25:44.586 --> 25:45.761
No.

25:45.761 --> 25:46.936
I studied Greek.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.547
This poem doesn't
make any sense.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.549
May I?
- Yeah.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.466
We need to translate this.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.034
Wait, don't you
need the journal?

25:58.034 --> 25:59.906
I have photographic memory.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.255
Take another look.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.780
The ancient
Greek word "tritos,"

26:04.780 --> 26:08.741
meaning the third,
and "deuteros," the second,

26:08.741 --> 26:10.786
what if they're code?

26:10.786 --> 26:14.529
For isotopes,
it's tritium and deuterium.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.836
He's using code
to hide the formula.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.272
Hannah, you found it!

26:18.272 --> 26:21.014
Now all we have left
to do is decrypt it.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.450
I would kiss you, Professor,

26:22.450 --> 26:24.757
but we're too busy
making history.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.106
If this works--

26:26.106 --> 26:28.108
It'll change the world.

26:30.632 --> 26:34.462
Ben, she needs
to stop translating.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.943
Ziggy already decrypted
the rest of the formula.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.161
It's dangerous.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.772
It makes the stellarator
highly unstable--

26:39.772 --> 26:42.513
a fusion reaction that could
destroy entire buildings.

26:42.513 --> 26:45.691
That's why he didn't
give it to Lawrence.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.127
It's not for clean energy.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.651
It's a bomb.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.131
I beg your pardon?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.046
Ziggy says if you
finish the translation

26:53.046 --> 26:55.831
and the Nazis get
hold of it, well--

26:55.831 --> 26:57.964
Hannah, we can't finish this.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.487
It's too dangerous.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.445
Those dreams
Einstein wrote about,

27:01.445 --> 27:03.317
fears of calamity and disaster,

27:03.317 --> 27:05.232
he was writing
about this formula.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.408
30 seconds ago, you were
asking me to decrypt this.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.627
Now you want me
to abandon ship?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.193
Look, I know
this sounds crazy.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.717
But please give me the journal.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.154
I can't do that.
It's too important.

27:14.154 --> 27:15.329
Hannah, if you leave here

27:15.329 --> 27:16.635
with that formula,
you will die.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.723
OK.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.985
There's going
to be an explosion

27:18.985 --> 27:20.813
that changes
the course of history.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.642
Professor, I don't know
what's happening to you.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.904
But I think I should go.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.253
Ben, you need to stop her.
She can't leave.

27:26.253 --> 27:29.038
Agent Robert Cook!

27:29.038 --> 27:31.562
He's the one
who told you to come here.

27:33.173 --> 27:35.001
You met him in a diner.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.264
You talked about Einstein

27:37.264 --> 27:41.485
and angular momentum
and yo-yos.

27:41.485 --> 27:45.098
And you helped him
save a young girl.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.361
And you told him not
to say goodbye,

27:47.361 --> 27:50.712
just see you later.

27:53.933 --> 27:57.110
How do you know all that?

27:57.110 --> 28:00.548
I know it the same way I know
what will happen to you

28:00.548 --> 28:03.029
if you leave here
with that formula.

28:05.161 --> 28:07.729
I'm a time traveler.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.170
You're a time traveler?

28:14.170 --> 28:16.303
Ben, this is
a complete violation

28:16.303 --> 28:17.739
of Quantum Leap protocol.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.610
Anything you tell her
will have major ramifications

28:19.610 --> 28:20.829
in the timeline.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.396
Will you please
leave me alone?

28:22.396 --> 28:25.791
Who are you talking to?

28:25.791 --> 28:28.968
A hologram from the future.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.839
Look, I know this sounds crazy.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.537
But you once told me
you believed in the impossible.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.760
I once misquoted Einstein

28:38.760 --> 28:41.110
because I knew
you'd correct me.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.898
Oh, my God.

28:46.812 --> 28:49.510
It's you, isn't it?

28:49.510 --> 28:52.252
You're Robert Cook.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.907
I was for a few days.

28:54.907 --> 28:58.214
And now I'm Professor McCoy.

28:58.214 --> 29:01.783
When I travel through time,
I leap into other people

29:01.783 --> 29:04.655
to change history
for the better.

29:06.353 --> 29:10.313
That's...

29:10.313 --> 29:12.402
incredible.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.708
Whoa!

29:13.708 --> 29:15.666
A guardian angel
sent from the future?

29:15.666 --> 29:18.582
That's got to be the most--the
most romantic bit of physics

29:18.582 --> 29:19.670
I've ever heard.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.107
That's it?

29:21.107 --> 29:23.500
You're on board
with the time traveler thing?

29:23.500 --> 29:27.287
Look, this is going to sound
crazy, but I recognized you.

29:27.287 --> 29:31.204
Not the outside of course,
but something inside you today.

29:31.204 --> 29:34.511
It didn't make any sense
to me then, but it does now.

29:34.511 --> 29:36.426
Trust me, my mind is racing.

29:36.426 --> 29:40.517
But I guess my heart kind
of already knew in a weird way.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.606
Wow, I--

29:42.606 --> 29:43.825
How long are you here for?

29:43.825 --> 29:46.045
It's different every time.

29:46.045 --> 29:48.525
Well, let's not
waste it then.

29:48.525 --> 29:52.094
So you're here in 1955

29:52.094 --> 29:55.445
to find Einstein's formula
and destroy it.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.838
Well, I thought it was that.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.535
But now I'm thinking maybe
I'm here to help you.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.929
Help me?

30:00.929 --> 30:02.713
Why?

30:04.106 --> 30:05.847
Oh.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.287
It's Donovan, isn't it?

30:11.287 --> 30:14.334
He's never going
to publish my work.

30:14.334 --> 30:18.468
I'm going to talk to Donovan,
explain everything we found.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.993
But in the meantime,
I need you to stay here

30:20.993 --> 30:24.257
because if I know you're here,
I know you're safe.

30:24.257 --> 30:27.651
You're asking me
to do nothing.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.436
I'm no good at that.

30:29.436 --> 30:33.875
I'm asking you to trust me

30:33.875 --> 30:37.226
because I'm trusting you.

30:39.489 --> 30:43.406
I'll be back soon, I promise.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.213
Hi.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.563
Hon, what are you doing here?

31:09.563 --> 31:14.046
Look, you know how
I put up too many walls

31:14.046 --> 31:17.832
and I keep secrets
and I don't let people in

31:17.832 --> 31:19.225
even when I need help?

31:19.225 --> 31:22.837
Well, this is me coming
to you right now because--

31:22.837 --> 31:24.708
I need your help.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.667
OK.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.712
The people
that you are working for

31:28.712 --> 31:30.540
are holding
Quantum Leap hostage.

31:30.540 --> 31:34.936
If I don't give them what
they want, then I lose Ben.

31:34.936 --> 31:38.070
And if I do give them
what they want,

31:38.070 --> 31:39.723
I don't even want
to think about what

31:39.723 --> 31:42.117
that would look like.

31:43.597 --> 31:47.818
I'm glad you're telling me.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.516
What do you need?

31:49.516 --> 31:52.954
I need you to rewrite
the firmware on the chip.

31:55.087 --> 31:58.394
So just to be clear,
you're asking me

31:58.394 --> 32:02.746
to work against my own boss
to jailbreak his tech,

32:02.746 --> 32:06.750
after which
he won't just fire me,

32:06.750 --> 32:07.882
he'll destroy my career.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.058
It's not a fair thing to ask.

32:10.058 --> 32:11.930
I know, I get that, but--

32:11.930 --> 32:14.236
My answer is yes.

32:16.630 --> 32:20.590
Of course I'll help you, Ian.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.769
I love you.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.250
I love you too.

32:37.390 --> 32:39.087
Anything
in the Paperclip files?

32:39.087 --> 32:41.960
Oh, only the names and
aliases of the most disgusting

32:41.960 --> 32:44.788
human beings to ever live.

32:44.788 --> 32:47.791
Whoa, are those fencing scars?

32:47.791 --> 32:50.925
Apparently it was a badge of
honor amongst the Nazi elite.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.579
The U.S. gave them
new identities,

32:52.579 --> 32:55.364
but scars told the real story.

32:55.364 --> 32:58.889
Didn't Donovan have a pair
of fencing swords on his wall?

32:58.889 --> 33:00.413
Sabers.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.284
Yes, he did.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.767
Donovan's not his real name.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.557
Oh, my God.

33:14.557 --> 33:17.038
I know it's not
the outcome we wanted.

33:17.038 --> 33:20.172
But the journal
is still a major discovery.

33:20.172 --> 33:23.392
I expect Ms. Carson to get
recognition for her find.

33:23.392 --> 33:24.741
And the formula?

33:24.741 --> 33:25.916
I had to destroy it.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.528
Einstein said
as much in his journals.

33:28.528 --> 33:29.833
It's too dangerous.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.835
But you did see the formula.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.012
Do you think
you could recreate it?

33:34.012 --> 33:36.101
Ben, Donovan's a Nazi.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.537
He's behind everything.

33:37.537 --> 33:39.060
You need to get out of here.

33:40.453 --> 33:43.586
My memory's not
what it used to be.

33:44.892 --> 33:48.939
Well, fortunately,

33:48.939 --> 33:51.072
Ms. Carson's
is quite remarkable.

33:53.292 --> 33:57.470
Donovan,
what the hell is going on?

33:57.470 --> 33:59.341
Not another step.

33:59.341 --> 34:04.129
Now, Hannah's going
to recreate the formula,

34:04.129 --> 34:06.740
or I'll kill you
where you stand.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.272
I don't understand.

34:17.272 --> 34:19.013
Why would you want the formula
when you know what it can do?

34:19.013 --> 34:21.929
He's a Nazi working
for the U.S. government.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.671
There's a certain
irony to it.

34:24.671 --> 34:27.978
You and your American brothers
flew across the channel

34:27.978 --> 34:31.634
to fight men like me,
only for your own government

34:31.634 --> 34:33.854
to bring us back together.

34:33.854 --> 34:37.858
But this time, I expect
the outcome to be different.

34:37.858 --> 34:39.599
He's going
to weaponize the machine.

34:39.599 --> 34:42.645
I told the Americans
I was being a good German,

34:42.645 --> 34:44.908
just following orders.

34:44.908 --> 34:48.129
But I have never stopped
believing in the cause.

34:48.129 --> 34:50.000
And with this technology,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.525
we can strike back
from the inside.

34:52.525 --> 34:54.396
You rat-faced son of a bitch.

34:54.396 --> 34:55.615
I'm not gonna
help you build a bomb!

34:55.615 --> 34:57.573
Ben, listen to me.
He has two targets.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.009
That gives us
a tactical advantage.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.663
Don't test me.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.536
Things could get very
unpleasant for both of you.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.277
You need to redirect the gun.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.800
Grab the barrel when he moves.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.324
Twist it downward as fast
as you can, and then attack.

35:09.324 --> 35:12.806
Recreate the formula, or I--

35:15.069 --> 35:17.245
Hannah, get down!

35:35.263 --> 35:37.178
Oh, crap.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.228
Ah!

35:56.458 --> 35:59.505
Auf wiedersehen, McCoy.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.775
- You all right?
- Yeah.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.516
Never punched a Nazi before.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.648
It felt pretty good.

36:15.651 --> 36:18.611
Never gets old.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.700
Watch your head
there, Adolph.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.972
So this is usually
the part where

36:31.972 --> 36:35.280
the hologram tells me that
everything's going to be OK.

36:35.280 --> 36:39.240
Oh, um, let's see.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.982
The Atomic Energy Commission
finally acknowledges

36:41.982 --> 36:45.899
Hannah's work, publishing it
all under her name.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.858
Donovan and his Aryan
buddies all go to prison.

36:48.858 --> 36:53.428
And Professor McCoy
gets another medal.

36:53.428 --> 36:57.432
Everybody ends up...

36:57.432 --> 36:59.304
Tom, you OK?

37:01.915 --> 37:04.657
Tom?

37:04.657 --> 37:07.181
Those kids over there,
carving their initials

37:07.181 --> 37:10.576
in the tree, Kate and I used
to sit under that same tree

37:10.576 --> 37:12.752
at lunch and look
at those same initials

37:12.752 --> 37:15.494
they're carving right now.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.974
It's strange.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.020
You think your whole
life's ahead of you,

37:20.020 --> 37:22.327
and then 50 years later,
someone else is sitting

37:22.327 --> 37:26.156
under the same tree,
thinking the exact same thing.

37:27.941 --> 37:31.814
Our future is just
someone else's past, isn't it?

37:33.163 --> 37:35.427
I'm so sorry.

37:35.427 --> 37:37.646
About your wife.

37:37.646 --> 37:40.562
Thanks, but--

37:40.562 --> 37:42.782
I'm sorry for your loss too.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.355
Right.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:00.321 --> 38:04.107
I missed my wife today.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.240
I know.

38:10.853 --> 38:15.771
This whole thing,
me and Kate, you and Ben--

38:15.771 --> 38:18.252
It's complicated.

38:18.252 --> 38:20.254
And it is messy.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.780
And it's OK.

38:27.827 --> 38:32.832
Look, it's OK to still
have those feelings, Tom.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.535
It doesn't take away
from what we have.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.988
Ian Wright in the flesh.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.773
Funny, I never got your name.

39:00.773 --> 39:02.296
We're not there yet.

39:02.296 --> 39:04.037
First, you need
to give me what I want.

39:04.037 --> 39:07.040
You mean, highly classified
government property.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.216
Yeah, that's not
going to happen.

39:09.216 --> 39:13.002
Simone, meet Jenn,
our head of security.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.482
So you do know my name.

39:14.482 --> 39:17.616
We also know where you work,
where you live,

39:17.616 --> 39:19.269
and what you've done.

39:19.269 --> 39:22.011
You blackmailed a federal
employee this morning.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.144
That was not a good move.

39:24.144 --> 39:28.453
This whole conversation's
being recorded, by the way.

39:28.453 --> 39:33.980
Well, look at the two of you,
all proud of yourselves.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.635
In the meantime,
that quantum chip will remain

39:36.635 --> 39:41.030
offline for, well, forever.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.730
We'll take our chances.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.438
So this is
the part where you leap?

39:57.438 --> 40:00.136
It feels like it.

40:00.136 --> 40:03.836
Oh, and when McCoy gets back,
he won't remember anything.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.446
So--
- Don't worry.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.405
I'll tell him
he suffered a concussion.

40:09.494 --> 40:12.148
But he didn't change my life.

40:12.148 --> 40:15.456
You did.

40:15.456 --> 40:18.372
I really wish we had more time.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.722
Me too.

40:20.722 --> 40:23.029
There's just so
much I want to know

40:23.029 --> 40:26.162
about time travel
and the future,

40:26.162 --> 40:31.298
but mostly
about you and your life.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.257
This is my life.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.434
I can't get home.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.610
I just keep leaping.

40:38.610 --> 40:42.483
And I meet all these
amazing people through time.

40:42.483 --> 40:47.270
But I never see them again.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.403
Except me.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.013
You don't really think
this is the last time

40:51.013 --> 40:52.798
you're going to see me, do you?

40:54.669 --> 40:59.413
OK, I want to know one thing,
future boy, just one.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.980
Oh, come on.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.286
All right, OK.

41:03.286 --> 41:04.810
One question.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.899
Go.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.814
What's your name?

41:11.077 --> 41:15.211
You could ask me any
question about the future

41:15.211 --> 41:20.521
of human history,
and you want to know my name?

41:21.653 --> 41:23.524
Correct.

41:25.004 --> 41:28.181
It's Ben.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.835
Ben Song.

41:29.835 --> 41:34.970
Well, Ben Song,
I'll see you later.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.624
I like your confidence.

41:36.624 --> 41:39.148
It's my theory, electromagnetism

41:39.148 --> 41:41.150
between two polarities.

41:41.150 --> 41:44.371
I'm moving forward in time,
and you're moving backward,

41:44.371 --> 41:47.330
creating a magnetic field
that brings us--
