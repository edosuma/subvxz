00:01.819 --> 00:04.221
Mother, Father,

00:04.256 --> 00:06.389
the beautiful giants on whose shoulders

00:06.425 --> 00:09.392
- I'm privileged to...
- What do you want?

00:09.428 --> 00:12.262
The Morelands need a new
babysitter for their triplets.

00:12.297 --> 00:14.598
Their old babysitter
just left for college.

00:14.633 --> 00:17.534
Girlfriend's sleeping on a stack
of cash instead of a bed.

00:17.569 --> 00:20.370
Three kindergarteners
are a lot to handle.

00:20.405 --> 00:22.572
I've babysat Lewie, Beast and Daphne.

00:22.608 --> 00:26.443
It's time for me to take those
skills and go professional.

00:26.478 --> 00:28.578
You've only watched the Terror
Trio for a couple of hours.

00:28.614 --> 00:29.614
Never all evening.

00:29.648 --> 00:31.515
You're welcome, by the way.

00:31.550 --> 00:33.316
And just because you wanna do something

00:33.352 --> 00:35.552
doesn't mean you're ready to do it.

00:35.587 --> 00:37.487
I need to borrow the car
to go to a bonfire party.

00:37.523 --> 00:39.623
Don't worry, it's on the beach,

00:39.658 --> 00:41.018
so if it gets out of hand,

00:41.043 --> 00:42.765
there'll be plenty of water to put it out.

00:42.789 --> 00:44.428
Exhibit A.

00:44.429 --> 00:46.263
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:46.298 --> 00:49.499
Right. Can you kick me down
a 20 for gas?

00:49.535 --> 00:51.434
You're babysitting the littles tonight.

00:51.470 --> 00:52.736
Your dad and I actually got invited to

00:52.771 --> 00:55.639
the neighborhood association meeting.

00:55.674 --> 00:57.474
Maybe that last big rain convinced 'em

00:57.509 --> 00:58.608
that we finally washed our car.

00:58.644 --> 01:00.577
It's a pot luck.

01:00.612 --> 01:03.613
They say the food at those
meetings is phenomenal.

01:03.649 --> 01:05.515
One time, I looked
through a hole in the fence.

01:05.551 --> 01:08.418
I thought I saw a nine-layer dip.

01:08.453 --> 01:10.420
That's two more layers
than I knew existed.

01:10.455 --> 01:12.355
And I can't say I'm thrilled

01:12.391 --> 01:14.658
about you going to a party where
fire is the central theme.

01:14.693 --> 01:16.459
Wait, wait.

01:16.495 --> 01:18.361
You're going to Ann Donovan's bonfire?

01:18.397 --> 01:19.462
How'd you get invited to that?

01:19.498 --> 01:20.664
Because I'm not you guys.

01:20.699 --> 01:22.532
It doesn't matter.

01:22.568 --> 01:23.633
Rachel's not going alone.

01:23.669 --> 01:25.502
The buddy system will keep her safe.

01:25.537 --> 01:27.488
Georgie and I can go
to the party with her.

01:27.513 --> 01:30.440
Yeah, we'll buddy up,
as is the way of the system.

01:30.475 --> 01:32.609
And I'll babysit Lewie, Beast and Daphne

01:32.644 --> 01:33.643
while the buddies go to the party.

01:33.679 --> 01:35.512
Buddies, no.

01:35.547 --> 01:36.680
Harley babysitting, yes.

01:36.715 --> 01:40.283
See? Even Rachel agrees with me.

01:40.319 --> 01:42.319
Well, kind of.

01:42.354 --> 01:44.454
Please give me this one shot.

01:44.489 --> 01:46.323
If I can wrangle the Terror Trio,

01:46.358 --> 01:48.592
I'm qualified to babysit anyone.

01:48.627 --> 01:50.560
And if anything goes wrong,

01:50.596 --> 01:51.661
you're right next door.

01:54.499 --> 01:57.367
- Okay.
- Yes!

01:57.402 --> 02:00.470
But only because I am very
excited about this buffet.

02:00.505 --> 02:02.539
I promise I won't let you down.

02:02.574 --> 02:04.641
<i>I had no idea this was coming.</i>

02:04.676 --> 02:07.277
- Now I take a left?
- GEORGIE: A left, right. [CRASHING]

03:13.612 --> 03:14.695
PLEASE NOTE:

03:14.720 --> 03:17.480
The home was delivered to me
with a chip in the coffee table,

03:17.516 --> 03:20.417
- a bite mark on the chair.
- What are you doing?

03:20.452 --> 03:22.619
If I'm being judged
on my babysitting tonight,

03:22.654 --> 03:24.454
it's important I return the house

03:24.489 --> 03:26.423
in the condition it was given.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.324
Grape juice stain on the rug.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.593
I thought that was part of the pattern.

03:30.629 --> 03:32.262
You're really bumming me out.

03:32.297 --> 03:34.230
Now if you'll follow me upstairs,

03:34.266 --> 03:35.665
I'd like to point out
several troubling smells

03:35.701 --> 03:37.500
I'm also not responsible for.

03:37.536 --> 03:39.436
I'll take your word for it.

03:39.471 --> 03:41.438
I'm trying not to kill my
appetite before this dinner.

03:41.473 --> 03:42.672
Honey, the dip is getting cold.

03:42.708 --> 03:45.341
Or warm. I have no idea
how they serve it.

03:46.378 --> 03:48.278
Wait. Where are my house key?

03:48.313 --> 03:49.379
Oh, allow me.

03:52.751 --> 03:55.518
I've been working on something
for such an emergency.

03:55.554 --> 03:59.456
No one should have to stick their
hands down our couch cushions.

03:59.491 --> 04:01.524
Dad was taking a nap
on the couch earlier, so...

04:08.500 --> 04:11.201
What's happening? Are you a witch?

04:11.236 --> 04:13.470
Don't be a witch on the one
night we get to go out.

04:13.538 --> 04:16.606
I'm calling it the Magna-Wow.

04:16.641 --> 04:19.375
And this is it on its weakest setting.

04:19.411 --> 04:22.212
If I reverse the polarity, well...

04:22.247 --> 04:24.347
Check it.

04:30.589 --> 04:34.257
Whoa. Neat trick.

04:34.292 --> 04:36.392
But no tinkering with potentially
dangerous inventions

04:36.428 --> 04:38.228
on the job.

04:38.263 --> 04:40.363
Focus on the potentially
dangerous humans.

04:40.398 --> 04:41.631
I'll be fine.

04:41.666 --> 04:45.301
With me, the Terror Trio
will be Harley's Angels.

04:49.407 --> 04:53.443
Time to break out all the fun
stuff Mom and Dad say no to.

04:53.478 --> 04:55.678
And Harley says yes.

04:55.714 --> 04:58.414
I can't believe she's babysitting
us for the whole night.

04:58.450 --> 05:01.217
She lets us do whatever we want.

05:01.253 --> 05:03.186
So, what are you feeling?

05:03.221 --> 05:05.622
Vacuum cleaner rodeo?

05:05.657 --> 05:08.491
I was more in a strawberry
cannon type of mood.

05:08.527 --> 05:10.393
Excellent choice.

05:10.428 --> 05:12.562
You know, for a babysitter,

05:12.597 --> 05:15.331
Harley really knows how to have fun.

05:15.367 --> 05:17.567
It's like she just gets us.

05:17.602 --> 05:19.335
It's like she's family.

05:21.673 --> 05:23.573
Did you hear Harley's babysitting?

05:23.608 --> 05:26.342
I'd love to sneak in some freeze tag.

05:26.378 --> 05:28.211
I've got a ton of ice ready to go.

05:29.447 --> 05:30.580
Isn't that kind of a big purse?

05:30.615 --> 05:32.215
We're just going next door.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.317
It's for leftovers.

05:34.352 --> 05:37.487
Hot and cold sections.

05:37.522 --> 05:39.422
So I lined my pockets
with tin foil for nothing.

05:39.457 --> 05:41.291
You'll thank me later.

05:44.329 --> 05:46.296
So good to see you, Bethany.

05:46.331 --> 05:49.232
- Thanks for the invite.
- Of course.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.568
What neighborhood topic
are we discussing tonight?

05:51.603 --> 05:53.503
Your family.

06:01.279 --> 06:02.645
I wish this was a daytime beach party,

06:02.681 --> 06:06.216
'cause I did, like,
30 pushups yesterday.

06:06.251 --> 06:07.584
Don't say that to anyone.

06:07.619 --> 06:10.587
See, this is why I don't
wanna babysit you two.

06:10.622 --> 06:13.623
You wouldn't even be going to this thing

06:13.658 --> 06:15.491
if it weren't for us.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.327
Pfft. Babysitting.

06:17.362 --> 06:20.230
Ooh, a juice box! It's goofy grape.

06:20.265 --> 06:22.332
Don't say that either.

06:22.367 --> 06:24.567
Don't worry. Having us along

06:24.603 --> 06:26.536
is going to be better than you think.

06:26.571 --> 06:28.338
Look, I found us a shortcut.

06:28.373 --> 06:29.606
Uh, let's see. At this street,

06:29.641 --> 06:31.441
you're gonna wanna take a right.

06:31.476 --> 06:33.243
Or is it a left?

06:33.278 --> 06:34.611
Georgie, it's coming up.

06:34.646 --> 06:36.479
Sorry, the reception's not great.

06:36.514 --> 06:38.414
I think it's a left,
but the little dotty thing

06:38.450 --> 06:40.316
that's supposed to be us
keeps jumping all over the map.

06:40.352 --> 06:42.352
Stay on the road, little dotty thing.

06:42.387 --> 06:43.686
You're a little dotty thing.

06:43.722 --> 06:45.688
- Now I take a left?
- Right. Right.

06:45.724 --> 06:47.523
[CRASHING]

06:47.559 --> 06:50.226
ETHAN: You hit the curb!

06:51.496 --> 06:53.630
I meant right as in correct.

06:53.665 --> 06:56.633
Yeah, left was the way to go.

07:01.239 --> 07:03.606
LEWIE: What should we play with first?

07:05.510 --> 07:08.411
Uh-oh. They're expecting
fun-time babysitter Harley.

07:08.446 --> 07:12.448
But tonight,
I've got something to prove.

07:12.484 --> 07:15.618
I'm going to have to hide
professional Harley

07:15.654 --> 07:18.521
in a fun-time wrapper.

07:18.556 --> 07:20.657
So what cool thing we gonna do?

07:20.692 --> 07:22.625
Nunchaku baseball?

07:22.661 --> 07:24.427
Beast, the blindfolded barber?

07:24.462 --> 07:28.298
Today, I'm ready to cut some bangs.

07:31.536 --> 07:33.603
Great ideas, guys.

07:33.638 --> 07:36.406
But since tonight's
more of a practice run

07:36.441 --> 07:38.441
for the Moreland triplets,

07:38.476 --> 07:40.643
I've got some new moves.

07:40.679 --> 07:43.546
First stop, whoo whoo! Dinner junction.

07:43.581 --> 07:45.682
- Are we gonna do blue dinner again?
- BOTH: Yeah!

07:47.385 --> 07:50.286
BEAST: That was an awesome blue mess.

07:50.322 --> 07:52.388
HARLEY: We are going
to kick it up a notch.

07:52.424 --> 07:55.224
White dinner!

07:55.260 --> 07:56.459
Underrated and super clean.

07:56.494 --> 07:58.494
Did you peel these chicken nuggets?

07:58.530 --> 08:02.198
Who needs that messy bread coating
when you can get quicker to the fun?

08:02.233 --> 08:04.634
- And what's more fun than...
- Can we have our toys back?

08:04.669 --> 08:07.270
Guys, Harley wouldn't just serve us

08:07.305 --> 08:10.340
boring old chicken nuggets.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.442
I bet you chew the top off
one of these bad boys,

08:12.477 --> 08:14.644
and your mouth turns frog green.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.383
Anything?

08:20.418 --> 08:22.385
Nope. Just the same old bad breath.

08:23.521 --> 08:25.421
Come on, give me a little credit.

08:25.457 --> 08:28.491
When do I not have a cool
activity or two up my sleeve?

08:28.526 --> 08:30.460
Who do you think I am... Ethan?

08:33.264 --> 08:35.298
Hey, what if we grab
our strawberry cannons

08:35.332 --> 08:36.499
and go play Beast Hunt?

08:36.534 --> 08:39.277
Last time we played that,
it was awesome.

08:39.703 --> 08:42.505
LEWIE: There he is! Hurry! Get him!

08:42.539 --> 08:44.474
It's jammed!

08:46.344 --> 08:48.211
Yeah, hit it!

08:48.246 --> 08:51.280
HARLEY: If you liked
Beast Hunt, you're gonna love...

08:51.316 --> 08:54.217
Beast hunts for laundry,
and everybody else helps, too.

08:56.688 --> 08:59.322
Go on, shoot it in.

08:59.357 --> 09:02.425
Oh, two points! One for each sock.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.396
Harley, I don't wanna
point out the obvious here,

09:06.431 --> 09:08.431
but you are clearly losing the room.

09:08.466 --> 09:11.334
Who says there isn't
anything hidden in the laundry?

09:11.369 --> 09:13.636
I found something hidden in the laundry.

09:13.671 --> 09:15.538
I don't wanna talk about it.

09:15.573 --> 09:18.174
Hey, what about your super magnet?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.575
We could tie a couple of golf clubs

09:19.611 --> 09:21.244
to the bottom of our skim boards,

09:21.279 --> 09:22.512
and skim around like space pilots.

09:22.547 --> 09:24.514
Or you could quietly

09:24.549 --> 09:26.482
skim through some books
and get ready for bed.

09:26.518 --> 09:28.217
Quietly?!

09:28.253 --> 09:29.519
Books?!

09:29.554 --> 09:30.586
Bed?!

09:33.291 --> 09:35.591
This toothpaste only tastes like mint.

09:35.627 --> 09:39.395
Remember the days she'd make it taste
like nacho cheese or cotton candy?

09:39.431 --> 09:41.464
I think she's trying to trick us.

09:41.499 --> 09:44.333
I bet she's saving the blue dinners

09:44.369 --> 09:47.603
and strawberry cannons
and magnetic whatever-it-is

09:47.639 --> 09:51.307
for those snot-nosed Moreland triplets.

09:51.342 --> 09:53.276
Let's face it.

09:53.311 --> 09:55.545
The Harley we know and love is gone.

09:55.580 --> 09:58.247
And whoever this phony is...

09:58.283 --> 10:00.283
is gonna pay.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.113
DAPHNE: Harley!

10:07.148 --> 10:09.746
I don't feel good.

10:13.588 --> 10:16.389
I hope it wasn't the chicken nuggets.

10:16.424 --> 10:18.458
At least, I think
they were chicken nuggets.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.426
Our white food supply was low.

10:20.462 --> 10:22.328
I found them in a plastic bag

10:22.364 --> 10:24.364
I had to chip out of the freezer.

10:26.468 --> 10:28.301
ETHAN: This has been a fun few hours.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.136
RACHEL: Thanks for the shortcut.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.537
I wouldn't have been able
to find the fastest route

10:31.573 --> 10:34.207
to a flat tire on my own.

10:34.242 --> 10:37.377
Much like in any game she plays,
Georgie has dropped the ball.

10:37.412 --> 10:40.246
But Ethan's here to scoop
up her fumble and score.

10:40.281 --> 10:42.281
Wow. From everything you're saying,

10:42.317 --> 10:44.217
you'd think you'd been
to more of my games.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.219
Do you even know how to change a tire?

10:46.254 --> 10:48.294
All that body spray
doesn't exactly scream pit crew.

10:48.323 --> 10:50.523
One, that's my natural scent.

10:50.558 --> 10:53.192
- And two, Dad showed me.
- Hmm.

10:59.601 --> 11:02.135
Funny. When I dropped the ball,

11:02.170 --> 11:03.569
at least it wasn't down a storm drain.

11:03.605 --> 11:05.471
No worries.

11:05.507 --> 11:08.307
It's perfectly safe to drive
with one missing lug nut.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.381
Okay, two is a different story,

11:15.417 --> 11:18.151
but one that can
still have a great ending.

11:18.186 --> 11:20.119
The only great ending

11:20.155 --> 11:21.354
is if this is a dream,

11:21.389 --> 11:23.423
and I wake up at the
party without you two.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.391
So close.

11:25.427 --> 11:28.127
Maybe if I can kick the closer.

11:30.365 --> 11:32.265

11:32.300 --> 11:34.534

We're leaving Ethan
for the wild animals.

with America's heroes,

country team for nothing.

So in summary, we're asking your family

12:09.604 --> 12:11.471

bowling in the street,

12:11.506 --> 12:13.439
breaking people's windows,

12:13.475 --> 12:15.174

televisions with the remote

12:15.210 --> 12:16.476

12:16.511 --> 12:19.245
A lot on this list dealing with windows.

farting through a megaphone.

at parties" to the list.

out of body parts,

They're already in bed.

get out the stain" mustard?

seriously as a babysitter,

to set some boundaries.

14:57.472 --> 15:00.106

to be taken for a walk.
