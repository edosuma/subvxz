MY BEST FRIEND.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.400
I WILL BE
IN ANTARCTICA.

08:13.433 --> 08:16.733
THAT'S HOW FAR AWAY I WILL BE
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

08:16.767 --> 08:19.433

08:27.167 --> 08:29.267
I WANT TO HAVE MY PENIS,
ALRIGHT ?

08:29.300 --> 08:31.600
AND MY TESTICLES INTACT.

08:31.633 --> 08:32.767

08:32.800 --> 08:36.367
SHE'S STARTING A WHOLE
NEW LIFE WITH SOME GUY--

08:36.400 --> 08:37.967
THIS IS MY LIFE
AND I'D LIKE TO LIVE IT

08:38.067 --> 08:40.333
BY NOT GOING
INTO HANDICAPPED PARKING.

08:42.767 --> 08:46.967
HEY, TOMORROW,
THE RESHOOT

08:47.067 --> 08:48.900

WANTED YOU TO BRING THE JACKET.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.200

09:00.833 --> 09:02.067
ALRIGHT, GOOD.

09:02.067 --> 09:03.833

A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS.

09:03.867 --> 09:05.867

09:05.900 --> 09:07.233
OH, WHAT DID
I DO NOW ?

09:07.267 --> 09:10.133
IT WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED YOU

09:10.167 --> 09:13.933
I FEEL VERY QUEER
TAKING HOUSE TOURS.

09:13.967 --> 09:15.733
WHAT QUEER, MY WIFE

09:15.767 --> 09:17.800

09:17.833 --> 09:19.967
DID YOU HAVE

09:20.067 --> 09:20.700

09:20.733 --> 09:22.233

09:22.267 --> 09:26.467
HEY, LOOK AT THAT CLOSET HOLE,

09:26.500 --> 09:27.367
I LIKE THOSE BEAMS.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.300
WHEN YOU MOVED
INTO YOUR HOUSE--

09:28.333 --> 09:31.667
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THAT ARCHITECT ?

09:34.867 --> 09:36.733
GOOD COFFEE.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.367

GOOD COFFEE.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.767
PRETEND THIS IS

10:07.467 --> 10:08.767
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.967
WHAT ARE YOU
SCREAMING ABOUT ?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.333
I'M TIRED OF LISTENING
TO THESE THINGS POP ALL OVER.

10:12.367 --> 10:13.600
I JUST FOUND THESE.

10:13.633 --> 10:18.700
I-I-I'LL POP 'EM TODAY
AND I'LL BE DONE WITH IT.

10:18.733 --> 10:22.033
WHAT'S...
WHAT'S WRONG, WHAT'S ?

10:22.067 --> 10:25.633
WHERE'S THAT CREAM-COLORED
JACKET WITH THE BLUE STITCHING ?

10:25.667 --> 10:30.133
OH, THE REALLY UGLY ONE
WITH THE HOLE IN IT ?

10:30.167 --> 10:31.300
YEAH, THE ONE
FROM THE MOVIE.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.033
I THREW IT AWAY.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.000
YOU THREW IT AWAY ?

10:34.033 --> 10:35.167
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU THREW IT AWAY ?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.067
YOU'RE WEREN'T
GONNA WEAR IT,

10:36.100 --> 10:37.733
IT HAD A HOLE IN IT,
IT'S HIDEOUS.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.800
OF COURSE IT HAD A HOLE IN IT,
THAT'S WHERE I GOT SHOT.

10:40.833 --> 10:44.433
I NEEDED IT
FOR THE RESHOOT.

10:44.467 --> 10:46.567
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE GONNA NEED IT.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.067
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS ?

10:48.100 --> 10:50.200
I MEAN, ALL KINDS OF
PROBLEMS THIS IS CAUSING

10:50.233 --> 10:52.367
BECAUSE THERE'S
A RESHOOT NOW,

10:52.400 --> 10:55.100
AND THIS JACKET'S
BEEN ESTABLISHED
IN OTHER SCENES AND...

10:55.133 --> 10:56.833
I THINK IT WAS
FROM MITCHELL'S.

10:56.867 --> 10:59.100
I SAW THE TAG,
MITCHELL'S ON MELROSE.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.767
MITCHELL'S ON MELROSE.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.967
OKAY.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.333
THAT'S NOT WORKING.

11:08.633 --> 11:09.867
THIS REALLY WORKS.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.067
YEAH, WELL,
IT LOOKS GREAT.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.533
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
STILL HAD THIS THING.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.067
OH, YEAH, WELL, THIS ACTUALLY,
THAT'S THE LAST ONE WE'VE GOT.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.700
OH, MAN,
YOU ARE SAVING ME.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.700
'CAUSE I DESPERATELY
NEEDED THIS

11:18.733 --> 11:20.633
TO DO THIS RESHOOT
ON THIS MOVIE.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.367
WELL, GREAT,
YOU'RE IN LUCK.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.700

11:30.367 --> 11:31.600
OH, THIS IS
AN EXTRA LARGE.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.800
LET ME SEE,
IT MIGHT NOT FIT.

11:33.833 --> 11:34.967
IT'S A GREAT
SWEATER TOO.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.233
AH, AH, WAY TOO BIG.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.067

11:44.767 --> 11:45.633
THAT'S OKAY,

11:45.667 --> 11:46.833
NO, I CAN TAKE
CARE OF IT.

11:46.867 --> 11:47.900
NO, NO PROBLEM.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.667

COMPLICATED, I CAN DO IT.

11:57.267 --> 11:58.467
IT'S NOT
THAT COMPLICATED ?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.800
ACTUALLY IT IS KIND OF
A LITTLE COMPLICATED.

12:00.833 --> 12:01.933
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
COMPLICATED.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.500

12:03.533 --> 12:05.633
CAN YOU LET GO OF,

GET IT DOWN, OKAY ?

12:20.367 --> 12:22.733
OH, I NEVER COULD HAVE
DONE THAT, THAT'S SO HARD TO DO.

12:22.767 --> 12:23.933
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA
ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

12:23.967 --> 12:26.067
I DON'T NEED TO BE INSULTED
IN MY OWN STORE.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.367
I'M GONNA ASK YOU

12:27.400 --> 12:28.333
ALRIGHT, I'LL JUST

12:28.367 --> 12:29.667
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,

12:38.067 --> 12:40.167
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE COME IN

12:40.200 --> 12:42.233
NO ONE REALLY DOES
ACTUALLY, AND IT'S GOOD.

12:42.267 --> 12:43.467
'CAUSE NO ONE'S CONSIDERATE
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.933
I'M CONSIDERATE
ENOUGH TO DO IT.

12:44.967 --> 12:46.767
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF
CONSIDERATION, OKAY ?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.067
IT'S ACTUALLY
YOU'RE INSULTING ME

12:48.067 --> 12:49.233

NOT GETTING THE JACKET.

12:49.267 --> 12:51.067

I WAS TRYING TO HELP YOU.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.067

16:21.967 --> 16:23.600
THE BED'S A LOT SMALLER

16:23.633 --> 16:25.633
YEAH, MAYBE I WILL
GET A BIGGER BED.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.233
YOU KNOW, I'LL HAVE THREE
OR FOUR MOTHERFUCKERS IN THERE.

16:27.267 --> 16:28.400

MOTHERFUCKERS IN THERE.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.467

AIN'T YOU ?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.133

16:41.400 --> 16:43.200
I GOT SOMEONE TO CLEAN UP AFTER,
GO AHEAD, THROW IT.

16:43.233 --> 16:44.067

16:56.633 --> 16:57.267
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING,

16:57.300 --> 16:58.433
NO, THANK YOU.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.900

17:06.433 --> 17:07.933

17:07.967 --> 17:12.067
I HAVE THE EXACT

17:12.100 --> 17:14.067
BUT, I MEAN,
I LOST IT, BUT I...

17:14.067 --> 17:15.167
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.400

17:16.433 --> 17:17.833

17:21.567 --> 17:24.867

BECAUSE I LOST THE JACKET.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.267
TRY THE FUCKING

17:26.300 --> 17:29.600
HOLY SHIT, I CAN'T

17:29.633 --> 17:31.367
I'M THINKING ABOUT
PUTTING A PLASMA SCREEN

17:31.400 --> 17:32.667

17:47.800 --> 17:49.233
I GOT PLENTY OF SHIT

17:49.267 --> 17:50.467
KRAZEE-EYEZ, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.467
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY SHIT.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.067
WE ROLL LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?

17:53.067 --> 17:54.067
ARE YOU MY CAUCASIAN ?

17:54.067 --> 17:55.500
I'M YOUR, MAN.

17:56.733 --> 17:57.767

17:58.800 --> 17:59.467
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.767
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

18:00.800 --> 18:01.767
HONEST TO GOD.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.167
I LOVE THE CRIB,
IT'S FANTASTIC.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.400
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

18:05.433 --> 18:07.733
MY WIFE'S GONNA KICK MY ASS,
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

18:07.767 --> 18:08.867
OH, SHIT,

18:11.233 --> 18:12.500
I KNOW HOW

18:12.533 --> 18:13.700
DON'T LET HER
FUCK WITH YOU.

18:13.733 --> 18:15.067

18:15.067 --> 18:17.067

YO DELICIOUS, GET A TISSUE,
MY MAN'S GONNA SNEEZE.

18:19.233 --> 18:20.533
DELICIOUS !

18:35.900 --> 18:37.867
THERE'S
NO DISCUSSION...

18:37.900 --> 18:39.833
NO DISCUSSIONS.

18:39.867 --> 18:41.567
HEY.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.233
HI BARBARA.

18:44.267 --> 18:45.700
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

18:45.733 --> 18:48.400
JUST CAME TO SEE YOU,
YOU KNOW.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.067
WHY ?

18:50.067 --> 18:50.933
HI WANDA.

18:50.967 --> 18:52.933
HEY LARRY.

18:52.967 --> 18:56.500
WELL, I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY
THINGS ENDED WITH US EARLIER...

18:56.533 --> 18:58.333
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE WERE HERE ?

18:58.367 --> 19:02.633
I WENT TO KRAZEE-EYEZ
AND HE TOLD ME.

19:02.667 --> 19:05.067
YOU WENT TO THAT
SONOFABITCH'S HOUSE.

19:05.067 --> 19:06.600
DO YOU KNOW
HE'S CHEATING ON ME ?

19:06.633 --> 19:10.533
THAT NO GOOD COCK-EYED BASTARD,
CHEATING, I KNOW.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.567
HE'S FUCKING AROUND,
LARRY.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.067
MY HUSBAND IS DEAD
AND I WOULDN'T FUCK AROUND.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.467
DID YOU INTERRUPT THOSE BUNCH OF
SLUTS UP THERE AND EVERYTHING ?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.067
A BIG FUCK FEST
GOING ON, LARRY ?

19:21.100 --> 19:22.967
NO, NO FUCK FEST,
NO FUCK FEST.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.333
JUST DELICIOUS,
THAT'S ALL.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.333
HE'S CHEATING
ON ME, LARRY.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.400
HAVE YOU TOLD HIM YET
THAT YOU KNOW ?

19:30.433 --> 19:31.767
NO, BUT I'M GOING TO.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.400
I'M GONNA TELL HIM THAT
AND A FEW OTHER THINGS TOO.

19:34.433 --> 19:37.067
WHEN HE ASKS YOU HOW YOU KNOW,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY ?

19:37.067 --> 19:38.900
I'M GONNA
TELL HIM I HEARD.

19:38.933 --> 19:40.900
HEARD FROM WHO ?

19:40.933 --> 19:43.400
UH, JUST, I HEARD
FROM SOMEBODY, I JUST...

19:43.433 --> 19:44.533
SOMEBODY ?

19:44.567 --> 19:46.600
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
BE A LITTLE SPECIFIC ?

19:46.633 --> 19:48.833
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE,
WHY DO YOU GIVE A SHIT ?

19:48.867 --> 19:51.067
WELL, I THINK YOU NEED TO
TELL HIM WHO YOU HEARD IT FROM,

19:51.067 --> 19:53.400
OTHERWISE HE COULD THINK
THE WRONG PERSON TOLD YOU,

19:53.433 --> 19:54.700
AND THAT WOULD BE BAD.

19:54.733 --> 19:56.233
BAD FOR WHO ?

19:56.267 --> 19:58.233
FOR THAT WRONG PERSON.

19:58.267 --> 20:00.733
LARRY, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
ABOUT THE WRONG PERSON.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.067
I THINK, THIS DOESN'T
EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE--

20:02.100 --> 20:05.033
NO, YOU GOT TO CARE
ABOUT THE WRONG PERSON.

20:05.067 --> 20:07.900
THE WRONG PERSON IS
AN INNOCENT PERSON.

20:07.933 --> 20:10.567
HE'S THE WRONG PERSON FOR
CHEATING ON ME, ALRIGHT ?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.367
ALRIGHT, THAT'S THE WRONG
MOTHERFUCKER RIGHT THERE, OKAY ?

20:13.400 --> 20:16.600
MAYBE WE SHOULD DANCE,
YOU WANT TO DANCE ?

20:16.633 --> 20:17.633
IT'S A SLOW SONG.

20:17.667 --> 20:22.067
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

20:22.100 --> 20:22.967
WHY ?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
BUT WE NEVER
GET TO DANCE.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.133
YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO.

20:26.167 --> 20:27.967
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.600
I CAN'T.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.100
YOU DUMB ASS, CAN'T YOU SEE
SHE IS LIQUORED UP, HORNY.

20:32.133 --> 20:33.367
THANK YOU.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.900
AND YOU, OH,
I DON'T WANT TO.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.033
I DON'T WANT TO DANCE
WITH MY WIFE.

20:37.067 --> 20:38.000
SORRY.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.033
FUCK THIS, I'M GOING
OVER THERE NOW.

20:40.067 --> 20:40.933
I'M NOT SITTING HERE
JABBERING WITH--

20:40.967 --> 20:42.133
GO !

20:42.167 --> 20:45.800
DON'T TELL HIM WHO TOLD YOU
AND JUST KICK HIS ASS.

20:45.833 --> 20:49.200
MY FRIEND
SO-AND-SO TOLD ME.

20:49.233 --> 20:50.700
I'M GONNA TELL HIM
I HEARD.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.667
... SO-AND-SO.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.100
YOU KNOW, HE THINKS
HE CAN GO AROUND L.A.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.067
JUST EATING PUSSY
LEFT AND RIGHT.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.000
NO, UH-UH, YOU DON'T
DO THAT TO ME.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.833
HEY, I'M OUT OF HERE.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.233
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, LARRY,
WALK WANDA OUT TO HER CAR.

21:03.267 --> 21:03.967
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.800
WHAT AM I,
A DETERRENT ?

21:05.833 --> 21:07.567
IT'S A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.133
SO, WHAT AM
I GONNA DO ?

21:10.700 --> 21:12.400
LARRY ?

21:12.433 --> 21:13.733
I'M IN HERE.

21:13.767 --> 21:16.667
OH.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.267
BARBARA IS A TALKER.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.433
HAVE YOU
NOTICED THAT ?

21:20.467 --> 21:21.667
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.933
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
DANCE WITH ME ?

21:24.967 --> 21:27.233
YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET THE WIDOW.

21:27.267 --> 21:29.967
WELL, WHAT ABOUT UPSETTING
YOUR WIFE, ONE DANCE ?

21:30.067 --> 21:32.367
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THE LOOK ON A WIDOW'S FACE

21:32.400 --> 21:34.367
WHEN COUPLES ARE DANCING.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.100
THEY'RE WITH A FRIEND
AND THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN

21:36.133 --> 21:37.067
THE FRIEND
STARTS DANCING--

21:37.100 --> 21:38.233
AND THEN
WHAT'S THE LOOK ?

21:38.267 --> 21:38.833
WHAT'S THE LOOK ?

21:38.867 --> 21:40.633
THEY GET DEPRESSED.

21:40.667 --> 21:44.367
I THINK JUST ONE DANCE
SHE WOULD'VE BEEN OKAY.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.733
YOU'RE REALLY DRUNK,
AREN'T YOU ?

21:45.767 --> 21:47.100
NO.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.500
LISTEN TO YOU, YOU'RE
COMPLETELY SLURRING YOUR WORDS.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.400
NO, I'M NOT.

21:51.433 --> 21:52.867
I HAVE A QUESTION.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.667
YEAH, I GOT A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS MYSELF.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.100
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DIDN'T, YOU DIDN'T,

21:57.133 --> 21:59.300
YOU DIDN'T
TELL HER, RIGHT ?

21:59.333 --> 22:00.300
WANDA ?

22:00.333 --> 22:01.800
I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

22:01.833 --> 22:03.067
I KNOW, I KNOW.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.167
UH, THE DAVID PROMISE.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.267
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

22:06.300 --> 22:08.233
YEAH, A DAVID PROMISE
IS WORTHLESS.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.533
THAT'S REALLY
NO GOOD.

22:09.567 --> 22:10.433
THIS DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

22:10.467 --> 22:11.667
I HAVE A QUESTION,

22:11.700 --> 22:14.267
WHAT DID YOU TELL KRAZEE-EYEZ
ABOUT ORAL SEX ?

22:16.867 --> 22:19.100
YEAH.
OH.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.067
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

22:22.067 --> 22:24.567
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

22:24.600 --> 22:25.433
WHY ARE YOU TALKING...

22:25.467 --> 22:26.833
I JUST CAN'T EVEN
BELIEVE THAT.

22:26.867 --> 22:29.733
BOY, THAT GUY.

22:29.767 --> 22:30.900
THAT GUY ?!

22:30.933 --> 22:34.133
YEAH, WHAT IS HE TALKING
TO WANDA ABOUT THAT FOR ?

22:34.167 --> 22:36.333
WE WERE HAVING
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

22:36.367 --> 22:37.233
WHY ?

22:37.267 --> 22:38.767
WHAT DID
WANDA TELL YOU ?

22:38.800 --> 22:41.700
WHAT DID YOU TELL
KRAZEE-EYEZ ?

22:41.733 --> 22:44.467
I DON'T, YOU KNOW,
DO WE NEED TO DISCUSS THIS ?

22:44.500 --> 22:46.067
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

22:46.067 --> 22:49.667
WELL, WE WERE JUST...

22:49.700 --> 22:51.167
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO IT ?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.367
NO, IT HURTS MY NECK SOMETIMES,
THAT'S ALL, THAT'S ALL I SAID.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.467
IT HURTS YOUR NECK ?

22:54.500 --> 22:56.733
SOMETIMES, IT HURTS MY NECK,
THAT'S ALL I SAID.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.900
CAN I ASK YOU IF YOU THINK
THAT'S APPROPRIATE TALK

22:58.933 --> 23:01.067
AT A PARTY WITH SOMEONE
THAT YOU HARDLY EVEN KNOW ?

23:01.100 --> 23:02.700
HE STARTED IT.

23:02.733 --> 23:04.300
IS THAT APPROPRIATE ?

23:04.333 --> 23:06.767
WELL, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,
SAY IT'S INAPPROPRIATE ?

23:06.800 --> 23:08.867
KRAZEE-EYEZ, I THINK
THAT SUBJECT'S

23:08.900 --> 23:10.633
A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE
FOR ME, I'M SORRY.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.067
( knocking )

23:14.367 --> 23:16.700
HOLY SHIT,
WHAT IS THAT ?

23:16.733 --> 23:18.233
WHO IS THAT ?

23:18.267 --> 23:19.767
ASK WHO IT IS ?

23:19.800 --> 23:20.867
WHO IS IT ?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.133
IT'S KILLA.

23:24.733 --> 23:26.700
UM, HOLD ON A SECOND.

23:26.733 --> 23:28.067
COME ON.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.700
HEY, WHERE'S LARRY AT ?

23:29.733 --> 23:31.133

23:50.200 --> 23:50.967
WHAT THE FUCK YOU SAY ?

23:51.067 --> 23:51.967
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:52.067 --> 23:53.100
I KNOW YOU SAID SOMETHING,
MOTHERFUCKER.

23:53.133 --> 23:55.067

MOTHERFUCKER.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.333

23:56.367 --> 23:57.167

23:57.200 --> 23:58.067
NO, I SWEAR TO GOD.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.167
I THOUGHT WE WERE
COOL DE LA, MAN.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.133
I'M COOL DE LA.

24:00.167 --> 24:01.067
WE AIN'T COOL DE LA ?

24:01.100 --> 24:02.333
NO, WE ARE COOL DE LA.

24:02.367 --> 24:04.533
MOTHERFUCKER, GET MY JACKET,
GET MY MOTHERFUCKING JACKET.

24:04.567 --> 24:06.333
KRAZEE-EYEZ--

24:06.367 --> 24:08.933

24:10.867 --> 24:13.833

24:15.233 --> 24:16.900
KRAZEE.

24:16.933 --> 24:20.900
HOW YOU GONNA THROW THE JACKET

24:20.933 --> 24:22.933
HOW YOU GONNA THROW
THE JACKET AT ME ?

24:22.967 --> 24:24.200
YOU AIN'T GOT NO ETIQUETTE,
MOTHERFUCKER.

24:24.233 --> 24:25.300

24:25.333 --> 24:26.100
KRAZEE-EYEZ, I--

24:26.133 --> 24:27.433
I LOVE THAT GIRL, MAN.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.233
I'M SORRY.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.433
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
ACT LIKE IT.

24:29.467 --> 24:30.067
HUH ?

24:30.100 --> 24:30.867
HE DOESN'T TREAT--

24:30.900 --> 24:32.367
YOU DON'T KNOW.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.433
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU
TREAT SOMEBODY YOU LOVE.

24:33.467 --> 24:34.600
DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO HER.

24:34.633 --> 24:37.200
LISTEN, THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU TREAT SOMEBODY YOU LOVE.

24:37.233 --> 24:39.067
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY NIGGA,
YOU AIN'T MY NIGGA.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.667
I'M YOUR NIGGA.
YOU AIN'T SHIT.

24:40.700 --> 24:41.533
KRAZEE-EYEZ.

24:41.567 --> 24:42.667
NO, NO, NO,
FUCK THAT SHIT.

24:48.767 --> 24:51.667
I HAVE NO JACKET FOR TOMORROW,
THAT'S GREAT.

24:51.700 --> 24:56.733
BUT MY NECK IS
FEELING PRETTY GOOD.

25:17.600 --> 25:21.567
( clearing throat )

25:21.600 --> 25:24.967
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

25:27.667 --> 25:29.500
WHAT IS, WAIT,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

25:29.533 --> 25:33.267
I THINK I SWALLOWED
A PUBIC HAIR.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.333
( clearing throat )

25:37.367 --> 25:39.067
OH, GOD.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.967
YEAH, JUMP IN,
ANY TIME.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.867
HEY, LARRY.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.233
HI, HOW ARE YOU ?

25:47.267 --> 25:47.967
GOOD.

25:48.067 --> 25:49.067
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:49.067 --> 25:50.200
WELCOME TO L.A.

25:50.233 --> 25:51.667
LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
I LIVED HERE FOR A WHILE,

25:51.700 --> 25:54.133
BUT I WAS ASKED
TO LEAVE.

25:54.167 --> 25:56.433
HEY, UM, I GOT
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

25:56.467 --> 26:00.067
WHAT'S THE MATTER ?

26:00.100 --> 26:04.200
I DON'T HAVE THE JACKET
FOR THE SCENE, YOU KNOW.

26:04.233 --> 26:07.933
THE ONE WITH THE LIGHT,
THE LIGHT WITH...

26:07.967 --> 26:09.067
THE BLUE SQUARES.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.633
THE WINDOW BOX DESIGNS,
YOU DON'T HAVE IT ?

26:10.667 --> 26:11.800
YEAH, YEAH,
THE BEIGE ONE, YEAH.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.100
MY WIFE THREW IT OUT.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.933
YOUR WIFE
THREW IT OUT.

26:14.967 --> 26:18.700
WELL, HOW, EXCUSE ME, BUT HOW
DID YOUR WIFE GET THE JACKET ?

26:18.733 --> 26:20.800
THE WARDROBE WOMAN MUST'VE
SOMEHOW MISPLACED IT--

26:20.833 --> 26:22.600
NO, I'M JUST, I MEAN,
THE THING IS OBVIOUSLY,

26:22.633 --> 26:23.800
I CAN'T RESHOOT
THE WHOLE SCENE.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.500
I JUST CAN'T DO THAT,
IT'D BE A KILLING.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.133
THE STUDIO WOULD SAY IT'S ONE,
I DON'T THINK, JOE, WHAT DO--

26:28.167 --> 26:29.667
IT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY, MARTY.

26:29.700 --> 26:30.800
I HAVE
A BACK-UP JACKET.

26:30.833 --> 26:34.067
PERFECT, OKAY, HERE WE ARE,
BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT.

26:34.067 --> 26:35.133
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

26:35.167 --> 26:36.300
HOW DID THIS
GET HERE ?

26:36.333 --> 26:38.067
I HAVE BACK-UP
FOR ALL MY WARDROBE.

26:38.067 --> 26:42.167
WELL, WHY DID YOU
TELL ME TO...

26:42.200 --> 26:44.267
TO MAKE SURE
TO BRING MY JACKET ?

26:44.300 --> 26:45.967
BECAUSE IT'S PART
OF MY WARDROBE.

26:46.067 --> 26:47.833
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TAKE ANY WARDROBE HOME.

26:47.867 --> 26:51.067
WELL, THEN HOW DID YOU
GET IT, UH...

26:51.067 --> 26:52.667
YOU TOOK IT HOME.

26:52.700 --> 26:55.533
I WANTED YOU
TO BRING IT BACK.

26:55.567 --> 26:57.633
BUT I HAVE ONE,
I HAVE AN EXTRA ONE.

26:57.667 --> 26:58.733
GOOD, OKAY.

26:58.767 --> 27:00.400
THANK YOU, WENDY,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

27:00.433 --> 27:02.633
ALRIGHT, WE GOT
THE JACKET, THAT'S IT.

27:02.667 --> 27:03.733
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS WOMAN,

27:03.767 --> 27:05.433
THE AGGRAVATION
THIS WOMAN CAUSED ME ?

27:05.467 --> 27:06.900
WHAT SHE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THE HELL SHE COULD'VE

27:06.933 --> 27:08.933
GIVEN YOU A JACKET TO TAKE HOME
NUMBER ONE, I DON'T GET IT.

27:08.967 --> 27:11.267
WELL, THEN SHE GAVE ME
THE IMPRESSION THAT

27:11.300 --> 27:12.333
THAT WAS
THE ONLY JACKET.

27:12.367 --> 27:14.067
THAT I WAS IN POSSESSION
OF THE ONLY JACKET.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.500
SHE MADE ME THINK IT
WAS THE ONLY ONE.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.700
ALRIGHT, WE GOT
THE JACKET.

27:16.733 --> 27:17.500
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING ?

27:17.533 --> 27:18.533
I UNDERSTAND,
I UNDERSTAND.

27:18.567 --> 27:19.533
WE GOT THE JACKET,
LET'S FORGET IT.

27:19.567 --> 27:21.600
WE GO, GET IT
TO MAKE-UP, WE GO.

27:21.633 --> 27:22.667
THAT'S IT.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.133
WHY DID SHE PUT IT
IN WITH MY STUFF ?

27:25.167 --> 27:27.100
HE'S GONNA
KILL ME THIS GUY.

27:27.133 --> 27:30.400
UNBELIEVABLE, WHAT DOES HE MEAN,
SHE GAVE HIM THE JACKET

27:30.433 --> 27:31.600
TO PUT IN THE,
WHAT IS THIS ?

27:31.633 --> 27:33.067
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT,
IT'LL BE ALRIGHT.

27:33.067 --> 27:34.400
WHICH WAY, DO I MAKE
A LEFT OVER HERE ?

27:34.433 --> 27:39.067
JUST, YEAH, JUST DOWN
THE CORNER TO THE LEFT.

27:39.067 --> 27:41.333
HOW MANY MORE SCENES
DO WE HAVE WITH HIM ?

27:41.367 --> 27:43.733
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THAT COCKSUCKER'S FACE

27:43.767 --> 27:45.067
WHEN I TOOK OUT
THAT KNIFE.

27:45.067 --> 27:47.533
HE SAID TO ME,

27:47.567 --> 27:50.333
HE SAID, YOU DON'T
GOT NO CALL.

27:50.367 --> 27:51.933
IMAGINE THAT ?

27:51.967 --> 27:53.700
YOU DON'T GOT NO CALL.

27:53.733 --> 27:57.667
I SAID I HAD
CALL YESTERDAY.

27:57.700 --> 27:59.467
I GOT CALL TODAY.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.900
AND I'LL HAVE
CALL TOMORROW.

28:01.933 --> 28:05.367
( clearing throat )

28:07.467 --> 28:08.867
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ?

28:08.900 --> 28:10.200
HE'S CHOKING.

28:10.233 --> 28:11.600
CUT IT, CUT !

28:11.633 --> 28:15.400
( clearing throat )
