WEBVTT

00:06.680 --> 00:09.120
When we've desired something
for a long time,

00:09.200 --> 00:12.120
it's only natural that once we get it,
we let ourselves go,

00:12.840 --> 00:16.480
without feeling guilty
about what we've done.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.040
But deep down,
we're only deceiving ourselves.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.960
Guilt is an infinitely powerful feeling,

00:30.160 --> 00:33.680
and one way or another,
it always comes back to you.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.520
I called you because,
the night of the auction,

00:37.600 --> 00:39.600
Mario was seen leaving in his car.

00:41.440 --> 00:45.160
He was with another woman.
I suppose it was his mistress.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.760
Who told you they saw him?

00:50.440 --> 00:51.880
Carlos Cifuentes.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.000
I'm so stupid.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.720
Mario's been cheating on me
all these years, and yet it still hurts.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.320
Hello?

01:20.800 --> 01:22.560
Yes, operator. Put him through.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.240
Yes, Commissioner. He's here.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.920
I'll put him on.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.760
It's the police station.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.760
Yes.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.560
I understand, sir.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.840
I'll go right away.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.200
It seems I've got news for you, too.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.800
They've found your husband's car.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:58.240 --> 03:02.160
Can you explain what's going on?
Why are you dressed like that?

03:03.360 --> 03:05.000
And who is Óscar Ruiz?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.280
I'm Óscar Ruiz.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.040
What are you talking about?

03:16.960 --> 03:18.720
I like feeling like I'm someone else.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.880
The other day, when I dressed up as Mario,

03:22.960 --> 03:25.560
I relived a part of my life
I've tried to erase.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.040
When I was little...

03:35.320 --> 03:39.520
I used to borrow my brothers' clothes
and go out on the street dressed as a boy.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.560
CHAPTER 12: GUILT

03:41.640 --> 03:45.720
One day my father saw me,
but he didn't make anything of it.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.040
What he thought
was an isolated incident...

03:52.720 --> 03:54.480
was something I did over and over.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.640
He threatened me to make me stop.
People were starting to talk.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.080
But I didn't listen to him.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.400
One day, I stood up to him.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.320
I told him how I felt.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.000
A man trapped in a woman's body.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.160
He gave me a terrible beating.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.800
He told me I was sick,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.560
and he made me swear
I'd never do it again.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.800
I managed to control my impulses
out of fear of my father,

04:38.600 --> 04:39.960
but now he isn't here.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.640
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.120
-If I hadn't asked for your help--
-No, none of it is your fault.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.680
I always knew
there was something different in me...

04:55.440 --> 04:57.720
something that was messed up.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.400
And no matter how much I try to,
I can't control it.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.240
Every time I look at myself
in the mirror, naked,

05:10.800 --> 05:12.320
I don't like what I see.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.800
I feel ashamed.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.320
Carlota, please, you have to help me.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.000
Did you see anyone
near the car that night?

05:32.080 --> 05:34.080
-Yes, I saw a woman.
-What was she like?

05:34.160 --> 05:37.640
Good-looking. You know what I mean.
A real looker.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.440
It was odd to see her alone in the woods.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.920
Was it her?

05:43.400 --> 05:44.320
No.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.320
It was dark and she was far away,
but she wasn't blonde.

05:49.400 --> 05:54.680
-She was dark-haired. I'm sure of that.
-Thank you. You've been a great help.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.560
At your service.

05:59.560 --> 06:03.040
Mario's mistress, Carolina,
is dark-haired.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.880
Maybe she lied to us that first time.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.320
I'll see to her.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.160
Take a good look at the car.
It may hold more surprises.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.200
You look really tired.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.760
I didn't sleep a wink.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.920
Carlos.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.000
You'd better go.
I don't want to complicate things.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.480
Good morning.

07:05.960 --> 07:06.880
Now what is it?

07:09.200 --> 07:11.720
I wanted to talk to you.
I saw you kissing Lidia.

07:12.240 --> 07:16.120
You could be a bit more careful
and go somewhere more discreet.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.360
Remember, we are still married.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.200
And what does my brother Carlos
say about all this?

07:21.520 --> 07:22.960
Is it part of the plan,

07:23.040 --> 07:25.880
or are sparks flying
between you two again?

07:25.960 --> 07:27.920
I'm in no mood for games, Elisa.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.240
What do you want?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.400
To talk you... but not here.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.000
You're Ángeles, aren't you?

08:03.840 --> 08:07.000
You look like a first-timer.
What can I do for you?

08:08.320 --> 08:09.880
I need information.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.080
About a policeman.

08:12.640 --> 08:17.120
I know in the past, Lidia came to you
for matters like this.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.200
Yes. That's right.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.120
Your friend Lidia still owes me one

08:26.200 --> 08:29.320
for some shady business
with a despicable policeman.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.200
No, thank you.
I don't want to put you in danger.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.039
You all say that.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.000
Why do you want me
to investigate that policeman?

08:42.480 --> 08:43.960
My husband has disappeared,

08:45.520 --> 08:48.640
and I'd like to have information

08:49.120 --> 08:51.160
about the inspector in charge of the case.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.360
I want to know
if he has children, a wife...

08:55.440 --> 08:57.520
I want to know
all about his personal life.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.480
I think that he's...

09:01.360 --> 09:03.000
a little attracted to me,

09:04.840 --> 09:07.160
and I want to know if I can seduce him.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.560
Very well.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.400
I suppose you know
that information has a price.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.920
-I'll give you what you ask.
-Good.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.520
What's the inspector's name?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.480
I missed Madrid so much
while I was locked up.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.120
-Its streets, its theaters--
-This isn't a date, Elisa.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
What do you want?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.480
My family is stealing from the foundation.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.120
How do they do it?

09:48.440 --> 09:52.520
At the end of every fundraiser,
your mother pockets part of the money.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.800
For the family.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.000
It's money that your brother uses,
of course.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.160
Embezzlement is a tradition
in the Cifuentes family.

10:01.240 --> 10:03.000
I want proof of that theft.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.800
I know that my father
always kept duplicate documents.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.040
Give them to me,
and your secret is safe with me.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.560
Lidia will never know
you’re betraying her, nor will Carlos.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.840
You think you can blackmail me with that?

10:26.520 --> 10:28.120
Your brother doesn't trust you.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.000
You destroyed his trust
when you told Lidia about our alliance.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.160
So don't count on me.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.480
Your mother is a dangerous enemy.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.560
Aren't you sick of her
always getting her way?

10:43.240 --> 10:46.840
She removed you from my father's will,
she threw you out of our home...

10:48.080 --> 10:50.160
I can't believe you don't hold a grudge.

10:52.520 --> 10:53.360
Please...

10:55.200 --> 10:58.200
Get me those documents
and we'll teach her a lesson.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.720
Very well.

11:11.360 --> 11:16.560
But this has a price,
and one day, I'll want to be paid.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.160
I have to take these to Switchboard 1.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.720
Thank you.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.360
This makes no sense.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.000
No, it doesn't.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.280
Where is Ángeles?
She should be here by now.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.240
Girls, I have to tell you something.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.560
I broke up with Pablo yesterday.
I didn't know where to go.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.800
-What happened?
-Nothing.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.240
Men are fickle.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.560
Today they love you, tomorrow their ex...

11:48.640 --> 11:51.000
-It's not worth talking about.
-Are you okay?

11:53.320 --> 11:55.400
-Marga? These are from Pablo.
-Yes.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.240
-Why couldn't he bring them?
-With the new security rules,

12:00.320 --> 12:02.800
only the messengers
are free to move around.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.120
He gave me this, too.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.920
Goodbye.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.520
My grandmother's engagement ring.

12:10.600 --> 12:15.240
You should talk to him
about what's happening to you two.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.840
Martín.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.360
Martín, wait!

12:26.880 --> 12:29.720
Good morning. I wanted to hand in my CV,

12:29.800 --> 12:32.080
in case they need telephone operators.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.400
Thank you.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.440
Marisol?

12:43.040 --> 12:44.640
What are you doing here?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.720
I wanted to know if you got the ring.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.120
Yes, I got it.
Why on earth did you put it on?

12:49.200 --> 12:51.280
Pablo, I couldn't help it.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.280
It looked so pretty, so shiny.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.600
You're like a magpie.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.840
From Marga.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.080
I'm sorry.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.760
You don't know how sorry I am.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.960
No, I don't.
I don't know how sorry you are.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.960
Do you know what I do know?

13:11.800 --> 13:14.920
Since you showed up,
everything's gone wrong with Marga!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.800
I won't take it anymore.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.240
It's over. No more lies.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.120
I'm going to tell your father
we're not together.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.200
No!

13:23.280 --> 13:26.680
I mean, I came to tell you
that my father is much better,

13:26.760 --> 13:28.920
and they've found a treatment for him.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Really?

13:30.080 --> 13:33.000
As soon as he's released,
I'll tell him myself.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.000
Is that okay?

13:35.840 --> 13:37.000
Yes, that's okay.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.080
That's best for everyone.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.680
Mrs. Vidal,

13:44.760 --> 13:47.480
Mr. Uribe wants you see you.
He's waiting on the roof.

13:47.840 --> 13:48.920
On the roof?

14:04.440 --> 14:05.720
Mr. Uribe.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.080
Good morning, Mrs. Vidal.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.040
-How can I help you?
-Just a moment. Pass me that bat, please.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.240
Mrs. Vidal, are you all right?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.400
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.160
-Are you sure?
-Yes, yes.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.640
Well, how can I help you?

14:40.720 --> 14:46.360
As you know, we are making
adjustments to the company rules,

14:46.440 --> 14:50.520
and I need you
in a position of responsibility.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.560
I want you to be
the switchboard controller.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.120
But my contract
is as a telephone operator.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.840
Think of it as a promotion.
With a higher salary, of course.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.840
And Sara?

15:03.920 --> 15:07.000
Yes, well,
it isn't that position, exactly.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.640
It's one that meets our new needs.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.480
Forgive me, but I remind you
that you're the wife of a criminal.

15:18.080 --> 15:20.360
You were disgraced
before the whole country.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.920
You think it's going to be easy for you
to get a job now?

15:26.640 --> 15:29.800
You have to support your daughter,
take care of her needs,

15:30.600 --> 15:32.080
but if that doesn't worry you...

15:32.160 --> 15:33.640
Of course it does.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.680
I'd do anything for her.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.000
So can I count on you?

15:41.400 --> 15:42.440
Ladies,

15:43.440 --> 15:46.880
I'd like you
to welcome Ángeles back again.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.920
Starting today, she will be supervising
your work on the switchboards.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.480
I think there's been a mistake.
That's my position.

15:54.560 --> 15:58.080
There's no mistake.
Ángeles will be the new controller

15:58.160 --> 16:02.120
in charge of implementing the new rules
for security and harmony.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.400
More rules? This is too much...

16:04.480 --> 16:07.200
Miss Carlota,
we'll do whatever is necessary

16:07.280 --> 16:09.360
to maintain order in the company,

16:09.760 --> 16:12.800
and until we feel safe,
the monitoring will be comprehensive.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.800
Ángeles has received express instructions

16:16.360 --> 16:18.520
enabling her to dismiss anyone

16:18.600 --> 16:21.000
who does not comply with the guidelines.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.960
As of today,
it is forbidden to make personal calls.

16:26.560 --> 16:30.040
In addition, any worker
wishing to leave her post

16:30.120 --> 16:32.560
must first ask for permission.

16:32.640 --> 16:33.600
Any questions?

16:33.680 --> 16:36.000
Can Carlota and I
come back to the switchboard?

16:37.480 --> 16:40.400
Here, disobedience has a price, ladies.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.680
Of course you can't come back yet.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.640
All right. Back to work, everyone.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.120
We've lost enough time already.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.120
Congratulations on your promotion.
You just became the Uribes' watchdog.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.480
Carlota, it was that or losing my job.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.760
And let me remind you,
I have a daughter to take care of.

17:04.839 --> 17:08.800
And if one of the girls breaks the rules,
what will you do? Fire her?

17:08.880 --> 17:10.360
Ángeles would never do that.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.800
Right?

17:13.359 --> 17:15.720
That doesn't need to happen.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.200
Respect the rules,
and there won't be a problem.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.119
Do you hear yourself? Do you hear her?

17:22.200 --> 17:24.839
-She's already talking like one of them.
-Let's calm down.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.680
Ángeles needed this job.
She had no choice.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.880
She didn't invent the rules,
so we shouldn't make her feel guilty.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.400
Better her than someone else, right?

17:44.440 --> 17:45.520
Are you all right?

17:45.600 --> 17:46.920
No, I'm not all right!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.960
The Uribes' attitude is unfair,
it's outrageous, it's...

17:50.040 --> 17:52.160
Carlota, it's not just that.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.360
This isn't just because of the rules.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.680
Is this about what I told you?

18:05.520 --> 18:06.480
Yes.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.240
Sara, I can't stop thinking about it.
I don't know what to do or say.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.320
I want to be with you.
But this is too much for me.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.840
And I feel it's my fault
for having asked you to help

18:17.920 --> 18:19.480
to dress like Mario.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.760
I opened Pandora's box
and let the demons out.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.600
No, none of this is your fault.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.560
None of it.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.360
I'm glad you saw me
in that boarding house,

18:29.080 --> 18:31.160
because it was something
I needed to get out.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.080
Now I feel much better.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.680
I feel relieved, I feel...

18:36.720 --> 18:37.960
closer to you.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.640
Now what do we do?

18:41.440 --> 18:44.480
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want you to push me away.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.760
That won't happen.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.120
How do you know?

18:51.560 --> 18:52.960
I can't lose you either.

19:00.200 --> 19:04.440
Yes, yes. And please,
I'm asking for absolute discretion.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.880
This must not be made public
under any circumstance.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.360
Of course, yes, yes.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.000
Thank you. Ciao.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.960
-Who were you talking to?
-What?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.360
Who were you talking to?

19:19.000 --> 19:23.800
Just an old friend from the country club.
You don't know him.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.640
How are things downstairs?

19:25.720 --> 19:28.680
They don't seem very happy
about the new rules,

19:28.760 --> 19:31.880
but they'll keep everyone
from causing trouble.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.480
You're ruthless, Alex.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.360
I wouldn't like to have you as a boss.

19:36.440 --> 19:41.360
I just want to show you that I'd be
an excellent director for this company.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.360
You didn't let me do it in New York.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.320
-I don't want to talk about New York.
-But I do.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.280
This has been going on for years,
and I'm still waiting.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.640
My patience is running out.
If we don't talk--

19:51.720 --> 19:54.080
-I don't want to talk today.
-Very well.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.040
Do you mind if I stay?
I want to make a call.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.520
-Here?
-Yes.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.160
The place is full of telephones.
Do you have to use this one?

20:04.080 --> 20:05.880
Do whatever you want.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.400
What are you doing?

20:25.560 --> 20:26.880
None of your business.

20:28.040 --> 20:31.440
Miss Lidia, you behave as if
this was your company.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.640
It's not yours, either.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.200
And you shouldn't touch that safe.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.320
Are you always this rude,
or is it just with me?

20:41.760 --> 20:44.560
When I met you,
I thought we could be friends.

20:45.560 --> 20:49.400
-But clearly, you have it out for me.
-I could say the same about you.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.240
What have you got against the operators?

20:52.320 --> 20:55.040
It seems you enjoy imposing
harsher and harsher rules.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.680
Your friends asked for it.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.480
Maybe they'll see for once
who's in charge here.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.520
I don't think
you have that straight either.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.560
Let me remind you
that you are not the director.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.440
I'm just here to look out
for my brother's interests.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.080
That makes two of us.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.600
So, please, stop snooping around
Mr. Uribe's things.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.680
Because next time I see you,
I won't hesitate to tell your brother.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.800
From what I heard, you and Alex Uribe
haven't exactly hit it off.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.600
You shouldn't listen to conversations
that don't concern you.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.000
That didn't concern me?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.640
I had something to do with that argument.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.720
Carlos, if you have something
to say to me, say it.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.960
I've got no time for nonsense.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.680
Come on, admit it...

22:06.720 --> 22:08.520
You can't stand my thing with her.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.640
Not everything revolves around you.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.960
Are you sure?

22:13.040 --> 22:16.040
If you're not jealous,
why do you have it in for her?

22:18.640 --> 22:22.400
If you stopped acting like a child,
you could learn a lot from Alex.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.760
She's an exceptional woman.

22:25.760 --> 22:28.640
She's interesting, modern,

22:29.280 --> 22:31.600
and she puts passion
into everything she does.

22:34.240 --> 22:37.640
I'm glad you finally found someone
who makes you happy.

22:39.320 --> 22:43.640
After all, we both deserve to move on.
Don't we?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.080
I don't know what else you want.
I told you everything I know.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.640
Tell me the truth.

22:57.640 --> 23:01.120
Mario's wife says he and his lover
were seen leaving in his car that night.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.800
We found his car in a ravine

23:03.880 --> 23:06.000
where a witness
saw a woman prowling around.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.520
A dark-haired woman. His lover.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.840
He got you pregnant
and paid you to forget the child.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.000
I think you had enough motive--

23:13.080 --> 23:14.520
Inspector, you're very wrong.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.040
Want me to tell you where I was?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.520
I was in the hospital,

23:21.360 --> 23:23.200
I started to bleed. I lost the baby.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.440
I'm sorry.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.280
Now you know.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.520
I gave back the money
because I don't need it.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.760
Ángeles had a miscarriage, too,

23:42.480 --> 23:44.320
because Mario beat her.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.160
Once, he gave her such a beating,
they lost the baby.

23:48.800 --> 23:52.200
So, Inspector, you might have to consider,
every time you question her,

23:52.280 --> 23:55.520
she has more reason to lie to you
than I do.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.840
Even to go as far as to try to kill
her husband, as you're insinuating.

23:59.320 --> 24:03.480
And if you don't believe me,
look at the medical reports.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.680
Francisco, last night
changed a lot of things for me.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.080
I finally feel
that I can move on... with you.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.600
Thanks for being so patient,

24:28.680 --> 24:30.960
for waiting so long.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.520
-Lidia...
-What's wrong?

24:36.840 --> 24:39.440
I haven't done things right
this whole time either.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.080
What does that matter now?

24:42.360 --> 24:45.400
Let's make the most of the chance
we have to be together.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.760
We'll truly love each other.

25:00.880 --> 25:02.760
I assure you, they're genuine.

25:03.480 --> 25:07.760
Irrefutable proof that my mother's been
stealing from the foundation for years.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.360
Where'd you get this?

25:10.160 --> 25:13.400
-It doesn't matter.
-Its value as evidence does matter.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.360
What do you want
in exchange for this, Elisa?

25:18.440 --> 25:22.400
Well, it's rather a delicate matter.

25:22.480 --> 25:27.480
All this time,
I haven't been recovering from vertigo.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.520
No, you were in a mental sanatorium.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.680
Your mother's not the only one
who can play dumb.

25:35.760 --> 25:40.240
Mr. Uribe, my family will have me
institutionalized unless you

25:40.320 --> 25:43.240
or one of your contacts
does something to stop it.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.680
You want your medical release.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.960
Are you sure it's the best thing for you?

25:52.920 --> 25:58.880
Going against the Cifuenteses puts you
in the situation I'm in now, but...

26:00.560 --> 26:01.760
Look at me.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.520
Do you think I'm crazy?

26:08.040 --> 26:11.400
I think you have yourself
a new ally, Elisa.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.520
Are you listening to yourself?
You and I are going to have trouble.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
What's going on?

26:23.000 --> 26:26.480
Maria José's mother is in the hospital
and Ángeles won't let her go see her.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.240
Girls, please.
Mario's theft has put my job in danger.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.280
I have no choice, really.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.360
I can't break the rules.
Don't you understand?

26:36.440 --> 26:38.120
No, I don't understand!

26:38.200 --> 26:40.240
Stop yelling
or I'll have to discipline you!

26:40.320 --> 26:42.240
Listen, girls, please...

26:42.320 --> 26:45.960
I'll take responsibility as supervisor.
Maria José, you can go.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.040
It's all right.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.240
No, it isn't...

26:49.280 --> 26:51.440
Maria José, please go. You'll be fine.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.600
-Sure.
-If you have to report it, do so.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.320
I'll face the consequences.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.880
I'm to blame for letting her go.
Punish me, not her.

27:03.960 --> 27:06.600
I agree. You are to blame.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.080
You disobeyed a superior, broke the rules

27:10.160 --> 27:12.560
and won't keep quiet when you're told to.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.800
You're fired.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.160
Excuse me? You can't do that, Miss Uribe.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.920
I'm sorry. There's no going back.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.280
You can't fire her.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.000
Great.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.920
Now you're eavesdropping.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.440
You're a paragon of virtue, Miss Aguilar.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.280
Sara's been a model worker for years.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.200
Firing her would be unfair
and have repercussions.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.000
The employees are discontented.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.000
That sounds like a threat.

27:39.080 --> 27:41.720
I remind you that
you don't make the decisions here.

27:41.800 --> 27:45.480
True. A decision this big
should be made by the director.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.480
Yes, but this is my decision,
and it's been made.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.120
Miss Millán, please get your things.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.440
Let's go!

27:58.560 --> 28:01.920
Miss Uribe, I must speak to you.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.400
-I have matters to attend to.
-It's important.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.400
You have more news for me?

28:06.480 --> 28:08.520
I resign from the post of controller.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.720
When I signed on, I didn't know
you'd fire Sara because of me.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.720
It wasn't your fault. She asked for it.

28:14.440 --> 28:15.480
But...

28:15.960 --> 28:18.400
I don't care. I'm no good at this job.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.960
I'm very grateful, but I resign.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.360
If you resign,

28:23.440 --> 28:26.960
we'll take you to court
for the 5,000 your husband stole.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.360
-What?
-Yes, you heard.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.680
And believe me, you'd lose.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.080
Sure, that's why you chose me.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.720
You know I'm at your mercy.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.760
It's up to you,

28:42.840 --> 28:45.560
but think about your daughter,
her future...

28:46.440 --> 28:47.680
Take it or leave it.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.560
We won't let them fire you.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.040
Carlota, leave things the way they are.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.280
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:02.360 --> 30:05.640
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:05.720 --> 30:08.640
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:08.720 --> 30:12.240
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:12.520 --> 30:15.800
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:16.120 --> 30:19.080
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:19.520 --> 30:22.720
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:22.800 --> 30:26.080
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:26.160 --> 30:29.160
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:29.800 --> 30:32.800
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:33.280 --> 30:36.480
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

30:37.080 --> 30:38.520
No more repression--

30:38.600 --> 30:41.120
Girls! Stop, girls!

30:41.200 --> 30:44.040
We, the company's operators,

30:44.120 --> 30:47.120
are here to assert our rights,
which are being trampled on.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.680
-Strike!
-Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

30:50.760 --> 30:54.680
-Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
-What's all this about?

30:55.400 --> 30:57.280
-Stop!
-We're not going to stop!

30:57.360 --> 30:58.520
You can't stop all of us.

30:58.600 --> 31:03.640
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
Strike! Strike!

31:12.760 --> 31:13.840
What's going on?

31:13.920 --> 31:16.640
The operators are going on strike
in the lobby.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.320
-Marga and Carlota, too?
-Yes, they started it all.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.840
-Why are the switchboards off?
-Is no one taking calls?

31:22.920 --> 31:25.200
-I don't know.
-What's going on here?

31:26.040 --> 31:27.520
What is this uproar?

31:29.080 --> 31:31.680
It's best to pretend
it was an electrical failure.

31:31.760 --> 31:35.560
I'll tell the few operators left
to stop taking calls.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.200
-Word of the strike shouldn't get out.
-A strike!

31:38.600 --> 31:39.760
How did it come to this?

31:39.840 --> 31:43.200
I told you people have been upset
since those rules were imposed.

31:43.280 --> 31:47.360
It's a long way from that to insurrection.
How long have they been preparing this?

31:47.440 --> 31:51.360
This morning, they met in the bar
to complain about the new situation,

31:51.440 --> 31:54.280
but firing Sara Millán was the last straw.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.000
You fired Miss Millán?

31:56.600 --> 31:58.400
Fine, come with me.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.760
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

32:05.320 --> 32:08.400
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

32:08.480 --> 32:09.680
Please!

32:09.760 --> 32:12.840
Please! What is this? Quiet!

32:12.920 --> 32:14.600
Quiet, please!

32:15.000 --> 32:17.960
Silence, I said! Please!

32:18.640 --> 32:19.960
What is this?

32:20.520 --> 32:22.440
You left your posts unattended.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.000
For God's sake!

32:25.080 --> 32:28.240
It's all your fault.
We'll return when Sara's rehired,

32:28.320 --> 32:31.640
and you do away
with management's new rules.

32:32.640 --> 32:36.600
What are you saying?
Don't be ridiculous, please.

32:36.680 --> 32:40.280
Don't you see that one call to the police
and you'll all be arrested?

32:40.360 --> 32:41.560
Really? Do it.

32:42.160 --> 32:46.040
Because we're not going to stop fighting
for our rights. We're not afraid of you.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.040
-You're not afraid of me?
-No.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.320
Then I won't need to call the police.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.800
I see you're the leader of all this.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.280
You'll go the way of Miss Millán.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.120
-You're fired!
-No!

33:00.160 --> 33:01.560
You can't fire her...

33:02.400 --> 33:06.080
because it was me.
I'm the ringleader.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.160
-No, I am!
-I am!

33:08.800 --> 33:10.880
The operators aren't alone.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.920
We're all suffering under your rules.
So if they're fired...

33:16.000 --> 33:17.360
we're leaving, too.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.240
And the clerks have something to say, too.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.400
God.

33:26.400 --> 33:30.080
If in one hour this company
hasn't returned to normal,

33:30.800 --> 33:33.040
you're all fired!

33:33.880 --> 33:35.080
You will be fired!

33:37.960 --> 33:39.080
Don't be so hasty.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.480
Let me negotiate. I'm sure
I can reach a deal to benefit everyone.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.280
You have half an hour.

33:50.400 --> 33:53.680
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

33:53.760 --> 33:57.240
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

33:57.320 --> 34:00.440
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

34:00.520 --> 34:03.800
No more repression, Uribe's resignation!

34:03.880 --> 34:05.520
No more repression!

34:09.639 --> 34:12.840
How could you let a strike
break out in the company?

34:12.920 --> 34:15.040
You should start reining in the staff--

34:15.120 --> 34:18.080
Yes, the staff!

34:19.960 --> 34:22.880
And I'll be reining in my partners, too.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.679
This evidence shows

34:30.760 --> 34:31.960
that you...

34:33.040 --> 34:37.440
have been dipping into
the foundation's coffers for years.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.719
What will you tell me now?
That they're fake?

34:42.400 --> 34:44.280
They have nothing to do with you?

34:45.639 --> 34:48.679
I always own up to what I've done.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.960
Then you admit it.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.120
You're incredible, Doña Carmen.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.560
This is much better.
It makes it easier for me.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.880
As of now, you're no longer
director of the foundation.

35:02.280 --> 35:07.200
However,
you will still be the public face,

35:07.280 --> 35:10.600
organizing parties for your friends,
auctions...

35:11.440 --> 35:15.520
But forget about having
any executive capacity.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.800
You need me. You know the legislation.

35:18.400 --> 35:23.400
The only reason the king allowed
a foreigner to run such a major company,

35:23.480 --> 35:27.000
is because he believes the Cifuenteses
are the senior partners.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.000
I advise you to not threaten me.

35:30.080 --> 35:35.320
You crush the strike,
I'll carry on with my foundation.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.960
It was you! I know it was!

35:49.040 --> 35:51.720
You gave Uribe
proof of the embezzlement.

35:51.800 --> 35:52.960
I was right about you!

35:54.040 --> 35:56.320
Mother, he didn't do it.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.880
I did.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.600
I took those documents to Uribe.
Francisco had nothing to do with it.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.160
Elisa, you're my flesh and blood.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.000
You didn't care about that
when you locked me up for six months,

36:11.080 --> 36:14.480
or when you tried to declare me unfit.
But it doesn't matter.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.920
I have my release, Mother.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.040
Elisa, you're making a mistake.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.040
Maybe.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.640
But don't you think
my freedom is worth it?

36:25.560 --> 36:29.600
You ruined my life,
and I'm paying you back in kind.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.520
Your family might hurt you...

36:35.600 --> 36:37.120
but it's still your family.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.400
Are you all right?

36:57.040 --> 37:00.600
"Pregnant patient with blood loss.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.480
Patient has received blow after fall.
Blood tests performed."

37:05.560 --> 37:09.200
Cuevas, the boys have finished
inspecting Mario Pérez's car.

37:09.280 --> 37:10.880
-And?
-They found blood.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.000
An injured man could've been
transported in the vehicle.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.960
This keeps getting worse.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.160
Especially since it was found
in the rear of the car.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.680
Ángeles, I was looking for you.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.320
This came for you.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.600
Thank you.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.680
"Be careful what you do. Victoria."

37:54.760 --> 37:56.960
"Inspector Cuevas. Born in Madrid...

37:57.040 --> 37:59.600
Clean record,

37:59.680 --> 38:01.880
except for one incident in 1927,

38:01.960 --> 38:03.880
in which he blamed a witness...

38:04.680 --> 38:06.400
who turned out to be innocent.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.240
The woman finally committed suicide,
jumping off a roof."

38:20.400 --> 38:21.640
That's it.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.160
Good luck.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.720
-How did it go?
-Fine.

38:32.800 --> 38:36.360
Now we wait and cross our fingers
that Lidia gets a good deal.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.520
After all he's done for you today,
you doubt that he loves you?

38:54.800 --> 38:56.080
Hello, Pablo.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.880
Hello, Marga.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.960
I never expected you to do that.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.640
Neither did I.
It's not something I usually do.

39:05.160 --> 39:07.760
But I saw you there
and I thought you were crazy...

39:07.840 --> 39:09.920
-Are you calling me crazy?
-No, not you.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.760
The whole thing was crazy.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.680
How could I work
in this company without you?

39:20.040 --> 39:22.280
Without seeing you
every day in the hallways?

39:24.560 --> 39:27.000
With you not being my Operator 47?

39:27.400 --> 39:29.480
Even if we're not together now.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.280
So I said to myself,

39:34.680 --> 39:38.680
"Pablo, have some guts for once
in your life and jump into the ring!"

39:39.320 --> 39:40.400
I mean, the lobby.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.200
-Marga.
-What?

39:55.680 --> 39:56.960
I...

39:58.560 --> 40:01.760
I want to have a fresh start with you...

40:05.000 --> 40:07.600
and be able to tell you every day
that I love you.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.440
And that I will always love you.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.720
-But Pablo...
-I don't care, let them all see.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.200
-María Inmaculada.
-Yes?

40:33.560 --> 40:34.920
Will you marry me?

40:36.040 --> 40:37.040
Yes!

40:38.120 --> 40:39.760
Wait! The ring...

40:42.000 --> 40:43.640
-I'll put it on you.
-Yes.

41:16.760 --> 41:19.800
-It's only a proposal, but...
-That's enough!

41:19.880 --> 41:23.920
I'm sure you knew about all this.
I can see the plan, Sebastián.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.160
"I feign ignorance, they go on strike
and I offer to act as mediator."

41:28.240 --> 41:31.400
-Those are just assumptions.
-Assumptions that make no sense.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.880
Now you'll say you knew nothing

41:33.960 --> 41:36.880
about the meeting that led to this,
that you weren't even there.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.400
You said it yourself,

41:38.480 --> 41:41.280
I wasn't at the meeting
because no one told me about it.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.440
If I had known,
who knows what I would've done?

41:44.520 --> 41:47.800
-Can you prove you weren't there?
-I arrived late for my shift.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.040
Why?

41:53.600 --> 41:55.200
I spent the night with someone.

41:56.960 --> 42:01.080
If you expect me to believe you,
you'd better be more precise.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.800
I was with a man.

42:06.800 --> 42:10.400
What man? Do you think
that's enough of an alibi?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.360
I'm not divulging my private life.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.600
And don't pry, because you have
more things to hide than I do.

42:15.680 --> 42:18.600
You defend yourself by attacking.
You're hiding something.

42:18.680 --> 42:21.080
-I'm not hiding anything.
-She was with me.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.080
We spent the night together.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.440
Well, and this morning.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.720
Lidia wasn't at the meeting
that incited the strike.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.320
Very well.

42:39.080 --> 42:42.920
I'll eliminate
the new switchboard security measures

42:43.000 --> 42:45.480
and rehire Miss Millán, but...

42:46.480 --> 42:49.280
as a simple operator, not as a supervisor.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.440
And free access?

42:54.240 --> 42:55.600
That ban will be lifted, too,

42:55.680 --> 42:59.560
but the searches will continue
on entry and exit.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.320
No one else is stealing from me here.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.480
-Is that enough?
-Yes, that's enough.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.720
Very well. Miss Aguilar,
go down and inform the strikers.

43:20.280 --> 43:21.280
Lidia...

43:22.800 --> 43:23.840
You did it.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.800
Thanks to you.
You said it in front of everyone.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.920
I wanted everyone to know.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.280
Hurry, they're waiting for you.
I'll see you later.

43:53.640 --> 43:58.280
I tried to betray her,
with all my might, Carlos, but I can't.

43:58.360 --> 44:00.800
It's over. Count me out.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.160
I love her.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.600
I love her too much.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.680
You miserable wretch!
How could I have trusted you?

44:26.240 --> 44:27.280
Mrs. Vidal.

44:28.600 --> 44:32.480
-Inspector, what are you doing here?
-I went to your place.

44:32.560 --> 44:35.400
Your neighbor said you had come back
to work for the company.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.720
Can we talk somewhere?
The bar across the street?

44:37.800 --> 44:38.640
No.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.280
No, not the bar. I know a better place.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.960
We won't be disturbed there.

44:46.040 --> 44:47.400
-Perfect.
-Follow me.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.680
Why didn't you tell me
your husband beat you,

45:02.400 --> 45:05.120
and that you had a miscarriage
a little over six months ago?

45:06.160 --> 45:08.200
I didn't think it was relevant
to the case.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.880
Or you thought it wasn't a good idea.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.040
We found blood in the car.

45:15.760 --> 45:19.200
And you had plenty of motive
to get rid of him.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.720
I didn't kill my husband.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.000
You didn't?

45:31.160 --> 45:33.000
Ángeles, get down from there!

45:33.080 --> 45:35.400
You have no idea
of what I've been through.

45:35.480 --> 45:37.720
Ángeles, give me your hand.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.800
Nothing... nothing makes sense.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.000
Please, take me home.

45:52.600 --> 45:53.720
Please.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.560
We did it!

46:01.560 --> 46:04.240
When you reveal
what you've been hiding,

46:04.320 --> 46:05.720
the guilt finally vanishes.

46:07.400 --> 46:11.160
Until someone comes along and reminds you
that all your actions have consequences.

46:12.720 --> 46:15.800
And sometimes,
the consequences are unexpected.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.720
Carlos, we have nothing
to talk about. Not anymore!

46:20.800 --> 46:23.560
As of now, you go your way
and I'll go mine.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.200
I don't have to hide it anymore.

46:26.800 --> 46:28.400
I'm in love with Francisco.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.640
Carlos, please, let go of me.

46:31.720 --> 46:35.240
It's your fault, you hear?
You drove me crazy.

46:35.320 --> 46:38.680
I'm going to make you pay
for all the damage you’ve done!

46:41.040 --> 46:42.040
Lidia!

46:43.760 --> 46:46.760
Lidia. Lidia! Call a doctor!

46:48.040 --> 46:49.280
Lidia, what's wrong?
