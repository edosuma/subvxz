WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.337
- In the beginning,
everyone wants to send you

00:04.338 --> 00:06.964
flowers and donate to,
like, a foundation

00:06.965 --> 00:09.800
for your dead person.
And they stop calling

00:09.801 --> 00:11.427
and writing because
they're over it,

00:11.428 --> 00:13.221
and they expect you
to be over it.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.889
- When's the last time you went
to your apartment?

00:14.890 --> 00:16.599
- A little before the funeral.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.768
- So, like, three months?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.686
This is our apartment.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.564
- This is our home.
- This is our home.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.234
- There's gotta be some things
you want to keep.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.777
Think about what
makes you happy.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.529
- Well, nothing makes me happy.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.031
- You think you knew him,
but you really didn't know him

00:32.032 --> 00:34.034
as well as you thought.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.541
- "I keep replaying
the day we met.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.167
"I couldn't believe it

00:43.168 --> 00:45.169
"when we realized
'Shawshank Redemption'

00:45.170 --> 00:48.464
"was both our favorite movie.
And 'Catcher in the Rye'

00:48.465 --> 00:50.258
"was our favorite book.

00:50.259 --> 00:54.262
"I came home and pinched myself
until my arm bruised

00:54.263 --> 00:57.683
"to make sure this day
wasn't a dream.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.435
"We're soul mates, Becca.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.938
We were made for each other."

01:06.775 --> 01:08.985
Griffin was in Kandahar.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.737
He was setting up
a field hospital

01:11.738 --> 01:13.781
when he killed by an IED.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.997
- Thank you for your sacrifice.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.001
Thank you for
your sacrifice.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.878
- Thank you for your sacrifice.

01:26.879 --> 01:31.174
- Being new to LA,
it just means so much to me

01:31.175 --> 01:33.301
to have found this community.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.386
I just feel so connected

01:35.387 --> 01:37.389
to each and every one of you.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.601
You feel like my family.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.145
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.120
- Leigh. Hi.
- Hey.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.039
- Claire mentioned
you're a widow too.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.750
Was your husband
in the military also? Or wife?

02:05.751 --> 02:07.376
- No, neither.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.794
- I just moved here
from Pendleton

02:08.795 --> 02:10.338
so I'm literally driving
around going

02:10.339 --> 02:11.923
"This is so beautiful."
- Yeah.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.382
- Venice Beach, Disneyland...

02:13.383 --> 02:15.676
- I know. It's a great city.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.720
Sorry, I've got to...
I teach at a class.

02:17.721 --> 02:19.138
- Oh, I love kids.
What grade?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.140
- No, it's an exercise...
it's like

02:21.141 --> 02:22.767
a ballet, yoga, pilates
combo thing.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.936
- Wow, that sounds amazing.
- Yeah.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.646
- I haven't worked out once
since Griffin died.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.439
I'm such a blob.
- Well...

02:28.440 --> 02:29.941
- What's the name
of the studio?

02:29.942 --> 02:31.859
- It's called Beautiful Beast.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.071
- Great name.
- Yeah.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.822
- Well, you have my number on
the roster.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.324
You know, I'm totally around.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.909
See, you know, maybe we could
hang out...

02:39.910 --> 02:41.369
- Sure, yeah. Running late.
- Okay.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.579
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.122
- I called her six times.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.624
- She's not calling
anyone back, Richard.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.376
- Okay, but I'm her father.

02:48.377 --> 02:49.961
- She just became a widow

02:49.962 --> 02:51.671
50 years sooner
than she expected.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.089
Could you maybe not make this
about you?

02:53.090 --> 02:54.799
Where's my tea?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.676
- I just know the power
that you have over her.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.636
- "Power"?

02:58.637 --> 03:00.763
Why does someone always have
to be in charge in your mind?

03:00.764 --> 03:02.431
Why is one of us
always winning?

03:02.432 --> 03:04.393
Where is my tea?
- It's coming.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.353
What's going on?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.230
- I'm just worried about her.
That's all.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.441
So am I.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.152
How could something
like this happen

03:14.153 --> 03:16.029
to someone who's just
so alive?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.992
- I go over it
and over it in my head.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.077
Sabrina thought that maybe
we'd make a donation

03:23.078 --> 03:24.912
in his name to the school
where he taught.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.372
- She's a class act, your wife.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.958
How's Evie?

03:29.084 --> 03:31.752
- Loving school in Ojai.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.296
Varsity equestrian.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.258
- How's business?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.635
- I was hoping to buy
the whole building.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.679
Fingers crossed
it's still in the cards.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.890
- But don't you make
your own hand?

03:43.891 --> 03:47.768
I mean, aren't your cards
something that you control?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.395
Here you go, ma'am.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.272
- Thank you.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.108
I have to go.
I have a delivery at 9:00.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.486
- Oh, come on.
- Thank you for the tea.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.199
- I would really like
to see my daughter.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.492
If you could...

04:03.493 --> 04:08.372
empower her to return my calls,
I would really appreciate it.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.961
I will try.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.556
That's a sexy face.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.975
- "Nothing is impossible.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.187
The word itself
says I'm possible."

04:31.188 --> 04:32.730
- Ew.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.607
- I know, this Nicholas Sparks
widow group

04:34.608 --> 04:36.734
keeps sending me
inspirational quotes

04:36.735 --> 04:39.028
that make me want to burn
the world down.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.780
- How's that different from
normal you?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.449
- I'm serious. She put on
the most spectacular show.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.119
She had this little tear
hanging on her perfect eyelash

04:47.120 --> 04:49.455
for the entire hour

04:49.456 --> 04:51.123
and everyone was obsessed
with her.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.708
- Sounds like she's got it
figured out.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.502
- Like she's got what
figured out?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.504
- How to make tragedy
glamorous.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.047
Like Jackie O.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.259
- Jules, normal people don't
envy tragedy.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.052
- Of course they do.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.054
For the rest of your life,
you're deep.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.181
It's like you've touched
the edge.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.767
I mean, obviously,
I don't think like that,

05:09.768 --> 05:12.645
but people milk their stories
for a reason.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.313
You should come to a meeting.
- No. No, thank you.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.024
- You'll see.
We're good at sharing.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.609
I tell the best stories.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.444
I have this one
about how I partied so hard

05:20.445 --> 05:23.447
I puked on Questlove.
Always kills.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.616
- You shouldn't
be proud of that.

05:24.617 --> 05:26.158
- It's my best story.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.869
- Leigh, would you please
call your father

05:27.870 --> 05:30.413
so that he stops bothering me?

05:30.414 --> 05:32.164
Texting doesn't count.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.750
- I don't want
to call him or anyone.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.794
- She's got an ironclad excuse.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.462
- Feel like I get
at least six months.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.756
- I'd say more.
- One call. Ten minutes.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.884
- If dad wanted to have
a better relationship with me,

05:42.885 --> 05:44.886
he could have been nicer to
Matt when he was alive.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.470
- Your father loved Matt.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.973
- Okay, I'm sorry,
were you not at my wedding

05:48.974 --> 05:51.809
when he came up to me
20 minutes before the ceremony

05:51.810 --> 05:53.020
to let me know that it was okay

05:53.021 --> 05:54.395
if I were having
second thoughts?

05:54.396 --> 05:55.564
- He would have done
that with anyone.

05:55.565 --> 05:57.190
That's what dads do.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.983
- Whatever, we can pretend
like that's reality.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.694
- So we're starting
class pass today.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.863
We don't make any money
from these people.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.948
We just want to hook 'em in
so that they buy a package,

06:05.949 --> 06:08.910
which we need big time,
so be extra nice.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.453
Okay?
Everybody got that?

06:10.454 --> 06:11.996
Nice with a cherry on top.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.414
- She's talking to you.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.790
- Pretty sure
she's talking to you.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.627
- Feels like
I'm talking to myself.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.795
Put your phones down.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.049
Go and get some sun.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.859
- Hi! I made it.

06:41.860 --> 06:45.029
- You did.
Jules, this...

06:45.030 --> 06:46.906
- Oh, I know.
Yeah, we've been hanging.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.408
Becca's so excited
to take your class.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.160
- This place is amazing.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.828
The light and the colors.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.039
Griff and I painted
our entire house warm colors

06:55.040 --> 06:56.707
so it always felt so cozy.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.876
- Wait, oh, my God.
Leigh's obsessed with color.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.879
She's always talking my ear off
about the power of chartreuse.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.215
You guys are like
the same person.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.716
- Hi, Mia Powell.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.468
It's my first time.
I'm on class pass.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.928
- Hey, Mia.
What's up?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.263
Let's get you set up.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.348
- It's my first time too.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.559
Don't go easy on me though.
Kick my ass.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.229
I'm ready to sweat.

07:20.983 --> 07:24.736
- 18, 19, 20.
Inhale, down.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.780
And exhale into boat.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.198
Come on, ladies,
I want to see you

07:29.199 --> 07:31.034
holding the position.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.621
And we're moving into
plank leg raises.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.373
20 reps, right leg.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.711
And leg up. And in. Leg up.
And in.

07:41.712 --> 07:44.172
If anyone planks, we will
start counting again.

07:44.173 --> 07:47.925
And up. And in. Six up. And in.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.344
Don't be the one
who lets everyone down.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.471
Or I'll start over again.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.807
And up. And in.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.186
No one gives up.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.860
- What the hell
happened in there?

08:05.861 --> 08:07.820
- I just wanted everyone
to give it their all.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.405
- Well, you certainly
got that, didn't you?

08:09.406 --> 08:10.948
- Yeah.
- It wasn't Leigh's fault.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.366
She told us to listen
to our bodies.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.993
- I did. I said that.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.745
- Do you want to grab a juice?
It's my treat.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.039
- Can't.
I've got a class at 2:00.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.042
- No, you don't.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.219
- I feel amazing.
It's the endorphins.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.595
You're lucky it's your job
to create endorphins

08:32.596 --> 08:34.138
three times a day.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.642
- Yeah, I don't feel
particularly lucky.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.894
- Are you a person of faith?

08:39.895 --> 08:41.729
- N-not... no.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.273
- Well, it helps.
Going to church every week.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.983
Checking in with God.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.528
- I mean, I still wonder why
he did this to me,

08:48.529 --> 08:51.447
but then I realize there's
a purpose to my life now.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.742
That's what my pastor says.

08:54.743 --> 08:58.412
- Your pastor thinks
that God made your husband die

08:58.413 --> 09:00.122
so that you can have a purpose?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.666
- I think he just means

09:01.667 --> 09:03.918
God doesn't give us
anything we can't handle.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.504
- I hear that a lot,
but I'm not quite sure

09:06.505 --> 09:08.756
what it means.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.342
- I think it means
we all have wells of strength

09:11.343 --> 09:12.677
we didn't realize we had.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.017
- Wasn't that interesting
what Claire was saying?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.061
About how self care
is so important

09:22.062 --> 09:24.230
and how we need to take care
of ourselves right now.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.148
- I was actually kind of
spacing out at group.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.526
Well, she was talking about

09:28.527 --> 09:30.653
this thing called skin hunger.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.239
- There were these studies
on monkeys and orphans

09:33.240 --> 09:35.700
who were never touched
and it made them go crazy.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.286
Griffin was deployed
for five months before he died.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.414
I don't even know the last time
I was touched that way.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.499
I think it's so important
to listen to Claire.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.418
I think we need
to take care of ourselves

09:45.419 --> 09:47.253
right now,
even though we don't want to...

09:50.757 --> 09:54.719
Korean spa on Western
where you can get massages

09:54.720 --> 09:56.429
and dip into
these little pools.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.930
And it's two for one Tuesdays

09:57.931 --> 09:59.724
so I made an appointment
for us at 8:00.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.058
And then I thought...

10:01.059 --> 10:03.311
- Sorry,
can I ask you something?

10:03.312 --> 10:05.062
- Yeah.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.231
- Do you know your husband's
passcode to his phone?

10:07.232 --> 10:10.610
- Of course, doesn't everyone?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.278
I mean,
otherwise I'd wonder

10:12.279 --> 10:14.406
who he was texting
that he didn't want me to see.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.617
I mean, but I also think
it's so important

10:17.618 --> 10:20.077
to have our own lives
and be independent.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.121
- Look, um...

10:22.122 --> 10:24.415
I know that...

10:24.416 --> 10:25.958
you think we have
a lot in common

10:25.959 --> 10:28.377
because we're both widows
and not 70,

10:28.378 --> 10:30.922
but to be honest

10:30.923 --> 10:34.426
I-I really don't
want new friends.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.553
I don't want to feel pressured
to respond to messages,

10:37.554 --> 10:39.889
and say yes to plans,
and hear your stories that,

10:39.890 --> 10:42.850
frankly, make me feel terrible
about my life.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.979
And I would rather be
angry and mean

10:46.980 --> 10:49.398
when I feel like it because
that's what I need right now.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.442
- I didn't...
- No, I'm... so...

10:51.443 --> 10:55.488
You are Jackie O
and I am Courtney Love.

10:55.489 --> 10:59.200
And Jackie O and Courtney Love
are not friends.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.828
Not in any universe.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.297
- What do I want to manifest?

11:13.298 --> 11:16.759
I am a successful
businesswoman.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.804
My daughters are independent
and thriving.

11:19.805 --> 11:23.266
I have a wonderful partner
who fulfills all of my needs,

11:23.267 --> 11:26.060
emotional, spiritual...

11:26.061 --> 11:28.729
sexual.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.606
- Mom.
You have to read this review.

11:30.607 --> 11:31.900
- What?

11:31.901 --> 11:33.526
- Kay, "The teacher went mental

11:33.527 --> 11:36.529
and screamed at us so much
I literally puked."

11:36.530 --> 11:38.781
We should put that on a sign.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.033
Classes so tough
we'll make you puke.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.579
- No. No. No.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.335
If this is the first review
that comes up,

11:51.336 --> 11:52.920
I mean,
we'll just go out of business.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.714
- Mom, it's fine.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.340
Tons of people love us.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.801
- Those people
don't write reviews.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.845
Maybe I should just take her
off the schedule.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.889
Lacey keeps asking
for more classes.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.599
- Okay, Leigh's hardly doing
any already.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.100
It's not fair.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.644
- Jules, how do you not get
how bad this is?

12:08.645 --> 12:11.522
- Why are you yelling at me?
It's her fault.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.983
I'm the good child for
the first time ever.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.361
- This review,
it can't stay up.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.406
Oh, God.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.255
- Can I get you started
with something to drink?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.549
- Hey.
Didn't...

12:38.550 --> 12:40.384
Were you at Beautiful Beast
yesterday?

12:40.385 --> 12:42.136
- Were you in that class?

12:42.137 --> 12:43.638
The teacher was
a total psychopath.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.808
My mom actually owns
that place.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.228
- Oh, right, I remember you.

12:50.229 --> 12:51.896
She should really fire
that girl.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.606
You guys are gonna have
a lawsuit or something.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.901
- Yeah. I'll tell her.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.861
Hey, I'd love to comp
you some classes.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.822
- Yeah,
I'm never going back there.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.282
- Yeah.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.118
We're a small studio,
women-owned,

13:06.119 --> 13:07.662
and even one review
like that can really

13:07.663 --> 13:09.414
take a dump on our ratings.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.251
Is there any way
you could take it down?

13:12.252 --> 13:14.169
- Are you serious right now?

13:15.379 --> 13:18.047
It wasn't just that girl.
The music sucked.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.924
And the ladies
were all Lulu Lemmings.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.135
And the photos in the lobby
were body-shaming propaganda.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.637
I workout to feel better
about myself

13:24.638 --> 13:26.431
and I left feeling worse.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.893
You read my review.
What did you do? Stalk me?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.979
- Of course not.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.398
But if I wanted to,
I could talk about

13:35.399 --> 13:39.569
how dirty my fork is
or how rude my server Mia was.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.945
Oh but, you know,
that wouldn't be fair

13:40.946 --> 13:42.447
to someone who depends
on her tips.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.366
- You know what?

13:45.367 --> 13:48.244
Just so you don't key my car,
fine.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.037
I'll take it down.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.207
Happy?
- Thank you.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.711
Thank you.
- Yep.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.755
- No, I swear, if
you were to cut her open

13:59.756 --> 14:01.132
she would bleed glitter.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.050
- Oh, my God. Block her.
Block her number.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.095
- Yeah, I know.
- Do it.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.764
- God.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.058
- So I have some news.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.439
- Ryan and I are engaged.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.691
- Wow.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.693
Congratulations.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.403
- We're actually looking
at venues right now.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.739
There's this cool place
downtown

14:24.740 --> 14:26.282
that has an opening in, like,
a month.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.992
- Ooh, that's fast.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.953
And you guys,
you got engaged last night?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.997
- Um... No.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.918
It was late June.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.504
- So just after Matt...
- Yeah.

14:42.633 --> 14:45.259
- Actually that was sort of
part of it.

14:45.260 --> 14:48.554
We both realized
that life is short.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.848
Why wait?
You know, why not

14:50.849 --> 14:53.684
become each other's person now?

14:53.685 --> 14:55.728
I haven't, like,
posted about it or anything

14:55.729 --> 14:58.272
because I didn't want you
to feel pressure.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.900
Like, you, you know,
had to be happy for me.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.818
- Of course I'm happy for you.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.195
- Thanks, lady.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.863
- But what about...

15:05.864 --> 15:08.659
when he was texting
that pastry chef?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.953
- That was, like,
nine months ago.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.121
- But aren't you afraid that
that's gonna happen again?

15:14.122 --> 15:16.207
- No,
because we worked through that.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.625
- So you're saying
that you trust him enough

15:17.626 --> 15:19.001
in order to pledge eternal...

15:19.002 --> 15:20.503
- Yes.
- Okay.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.381
- Because we worked through it.
- Okay.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.886
Look, I know that you're going
through a hard time right now,

15:28.887 --> 15:30.805
but the best friend
code of conduct

15:30.806 --> 15:33.516
is to at least pretend
to be excited for me

15:33.517 --> 15:35.810
and maybe not trash my fiancé

15:35.811 --> 15:37.687
because he made one mistake
one time.

15:37.688 --> 15:39.730
- So are you just...
you're leaving?

15:39.731 --> 15:41.858
- I've like 20 pieces to edit
before the end of the day.

15:41.859 --> 15:45.028
- Okay.
- I'll catch you later, okay?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.242
- So I'm in my office,

15:51.243 --> 15:53.744
and this is, like,
six or seven months ago, right.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.581
And, uh...
and Tamara Shue walks in.

15:56.582 --> 15:58.291
You guys know who she is,
right?

15:58.292 --> 16:00.334
- She's the CEO of Cerberus.
- I know who she is...

16:00.335 --> 16:01.919
- Shh. Shh. Go.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.630
- So she asks if I can help her

16:04.631 --> 16:06.299
debug her program.
I'm serious.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.261
I'm serious.
- Debug the program.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.221
- Debug her program
is what she said.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.931
So she's sitting right across
from me

16:13.932 --> 16:16.058
and, I swear to God,
she just, like,

16:16.059 --> 16:17.643
starts "Basic Instincting" me.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.770
What?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.022
- That did not happen.

16:20.023 --> 16:21.814
- Yes, it did happen.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.192
- Daniel, you're supposed
to be telling a truth or a lie.

16:24.193 --> 16:25.943
- Yeah, not some seventh grade
fantasy.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.362
- You've got such a tell.
You just can't stop grinning.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.281
Which is why you can never
go to Vegas.

16:33.577 --> 16:37.330
- My turn.
- Okay.

16:37.331 --> 16:39.707
Truth or lie.
Truth or lie.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.542
Truth or lie.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.962
Truth or...

16:45.631 --> 16:47.298
- Okay.

16:47.299 --> 16:50.927
So when I was
a junior in high school.

16:50.928 --> 16:53.137
Danny and I...

16:53.138 --> 16:56.390
had this SAT tutor
named Cassie.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.100
- Cassie!
- Yeah.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.354
She was probably around,
I don't know, 27, 28.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.649
And it was the night before
the SATS

17:04.650 --> 17:06.734
and I was nervous.

17:06.735 --> 17:08.528
Super nervous.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.696
And Cassie says, "The only
thing to do tonight

17:10.697 --> 17:12.240
is to relax."
And I'm like,

17:12.241 --> 17:13.658
"I can't."
Because I'm me.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.910
And she says,

17:15.911 --> 17:17.995
"Come with me."

17:17.996 --> 17:21.040
- So we drive
to Bridgeburn Park,

17:21.041 --> 17:23.835
back behind the restrooms,
you know.

17:23.836 --> 17:26.587
There's this red-haired mom
and her baby on the swings

17:26.588 --> 17:30.174
and she looked at us and...

17:30.175 --> 17:33.344
they left like they knew
we were up to something.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.097
And Cassie pulls out a joint

17:36.098 --> 17:38.266
and takes a drag...
- Nice.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.017
- And leans over

17:40.018 --> 17:43.479
and blows smoke into my mouth.

17:45.399 --> 17:46.899
- And as she does this

17:46.900 --> 17:49.986
she licks my lips just
the tiniest bit.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.615
- It was the hottest thing
that ever happened to me.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.367
- Yeah.

17:56.368 --> 17:59.036
- Little did I know
how much hotness I had to come.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.709
- Lucky man.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.170
- You... you never,
you never told me that.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.213
- Yeah, that's 'cause
it never happened.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.466
- Come on, man.

18:16.263 --> 18:19.682
- Leigh, you're in trouble.
- Why?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.392
- That was way too good.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.687
- Planned it.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.282
- Did you see this?

18:36.283 --> 18:38.910
What she said.
- What who said?

18:38.911 --> 18:41.537
- That girl.
Jules, she updated her review

18:41.538 --> 18:43.372
to say that
"One of the teachers

18:43.373 --> 18:46.084
followed me to my place
of business and threatened me."

18:47.044 --> 18:48.711
- I was trying
to fix Leigh's mess.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.546
She's the one
that made her puke.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.840
It's one bad review.
Who cares?

18:52.841 --> 18:55.301
There's a margin for error
in running a business.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.011
You always tell me that.

18:57.012 --> 19:00.056
- No. No. Jules, there is
no margin for error anymore.

19:00.057 --> 19:03.143
The margin for error
got spent on rehab.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.566
- Why didn't you tell me that?

19:13.403 --> 19:15.655
- I was glad to do it
and you're in recovery,

19:15.656 --> 19:17.198
and that's what's important.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.450
But, Jules,
you're getting too old

19:19.451 --> 19:21.285
to be pulling
these kind of stunts.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.913
- Of course,
it was me that messed up.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.706
- Jules!
- It always comes back to me.

19:25.707 --> 19:30.169
- You cannot follow our clients
to their workplaces.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.964
I would have thought
that was obvious.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.258
And I am plenty mad
at your sister.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.593
But in case you hadn't noticed,
her husband...

19:37.594 --> 19:39.513
- Just died.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.599
I know.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.518
Jules, I'm s...

20:08.667 --> 20:11.377
- Look, we go in.
Have a nice pleasant dinner.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.588
Ask your dad about the wine.

20:13.589 --> 20:16.507
- We ask Evie
some horse questions.

20:16.508 --> 20:20.970
We ask Sabrina about
the landing probe on Mars,

20:20.971 --> 20:22.597
or whatever she's working on.

20:22.598 --> 20:25.016
And that's it.
We go home.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.018
And I'll be there
the whole time, pretending

20:27.019 --> 20:29.478
this is exactly where I want
to be on a Tuesday night.

20:29.479 --> 20:31.063
- Emphasis on "pretend."
- So what?

20:31.064 --> 20:33.108
We all pretend all the time.
- We do?

20:35.027 --> 20:37.695
What do you pretend?
- I don't know.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.238
- Like what?

20:39.239 --> 20:41.115
- All right,
I pretend I love teaching.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.159
On a lot of days I don't.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.037
I pretend I...

20:46.038 --> 20:48.457
I don't notice when people
stare at us at restaurants.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.627
I pretend...

20:52.628 --> 20:55.379
getting up in the morning
isn't as hard it is some days.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.633
I...

20:58.884 --> 21:00.843
I pretend I'm totally cool
with having sex with one person

21:00.844 --> 21:02.595
for the rest of my life.
Should I go on?

21:02.596 --> 21:04.972
- No, definitely not.
- Well, you pretend too.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.933
That's marriage.
That's being a person.

21:06.934 --> 21:10.186
- I guess, but I just don't
feel like pretending right now.

21:10.187 --> 21:12.063
- Leigh.

21:12.064 --> 21:14.273
Got to let that go.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.776
- Okay, that's easy for you to
say 'cause he's not your dad.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.903
- No, my dad never wanted
to be in the same room as me,

21:18.904 --> 21:21.072
and now that he's dead,
he never has to ever again.

21:21.073 --> 21:22.532
- Okay.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.408
- Richard's not perfect,
but he's trying.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.661
He wants to spend time
with you.

21:25.662 --> 21:27.495
That's something.

21:34.253 --> 21:36.462
- Seriously?
We're going home?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.256
- Yeah.

21:38.257 --> 21:39.757
I'll just send him
a text message

21:39.758 --> 21:41.843
that something came up.

21:41.844 --> 21:44.637
- You hold people to
impossibly high standards.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.890
No one's ever gonna pass
your test.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.998
How are you?

22:11.999 --> 22:14.542
Um...

22:14.543 --> 22:16.752
I think I'm stuck in
whatever stage it is

22:16.753 --> 22:18.296
when you're a raging bitch
to everyone

22:18.297 --> 22:20.131
within a ten mile radius.

22:20.132 --> 22:21.549
- Apparently that whole

22:21.550 --> 22:23.634
Kubler-Ross stages
of grief thing...

22:23.635 --> 22:25.344
Bullshit.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.930
- Yeah.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.975
- I, um...

22:32.019 --> 22:33.896
I actually came
to ask you something.

22:34.897 --> 22:36.190
- Shoot.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.485
- Why did you cheat on Mom?

22:42.946 --> 22:44.990
Just tell me the truth.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.284
- Talked about it enough in
therapy by now.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.078
I got it down.

22:52.206 --> 22:54.166
Started when I got fired.

22:55.334 --> 22:58.378
It was the first time anything
like that ever happened to me.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.465
And it was...

23:02.466 --> 23:04.675
it was unfair.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.470
Also humiliating.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.765
I...

23:10.766 --> 23:13.477
I had no idea something like
that could happen.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.438
For me, it was just...

23:18.398 --> 23:20.609
Well, it was a huge loss.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.946
And I lashed out.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.199
Hard.

23:29.284 --> 23:32.370
- And people say
I take after Mom.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.875
Sometimes when a person drowns,
they thrash around so much,

23:37.876 --> 23:41.045
they bring down anyone
trying to rescue 'em.

23:41.046 --> 23:43.257
Even if they don't mean to.

23:46.510 --> 23:49.137
So why you asking
me this now?

23:50.806 --> 23:52.933
- I just needed to know.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.121
- I'm calling the cops.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.540
- No, I just need, like,
two minutes.

24:17.541 --> 24:19.585
Okay. Two.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.756
My brother-in-law died
3 1/2 months ago.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.176
Matt was the glue
that held us together.

24:28.177 --> 24:30.303
I mean, everyone was just
better when he was around.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.389
And that girl, the teacher,

24:33.390 --> 24:35.808
she's my sister.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.895
Matt was her husband.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.688
Look, I don't know

24:40.689 --> 24:42.773
if you've ever
lost anyone suddenly

24:42.774 --> 24:45.360
and had your entire worldview
just fall apart over night.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.659
So you get it?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.828
Like, you lose this person

24:55.829 --> 24:57.580
who meant so much to you

24:57.581 --> 25:00.708
and you start spinning out
in all these weird ways

25:00.709 --> 25:02.628
because you don't even know
who you are anymore.

25:09.968 --> 25:12.512
My sister's in freefall.

25:12.513 --> 25:15.389
And she just needs some time

25:15.390 --> 25:17.893
to turn everything
right side up again.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.729
I know you think
basically everyone

25:21.730 --> 25:24.649
in my family is crazy
at this point,

25:24.650 --> 25:27.109
but if you could
just give us a break

25:27.110 --> 25:30.781
and take down that review...

25:33.033 --> 25:35.661
I can do that.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.209
Thank you.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.961
- Hi.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.267
You had this perfect marriage

26:41.268 --> 26:44.062
and your husband died a hero.

26:44.980 --> 26:49.359
And mine died for nothing.

26:52.571 --> 26:55.365
And I'm beginning to think
I didn't even know him.

27:00.329 --> 27:03.206
I shouldn't have yelled
at you.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.000
I'm sorry.

27:07.252 --> 27:11.840
I'm just mad all the time.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.389
- That letter that I read.

27:21.183 --> 27:23.727
He wrote it after I told him
I wanted a divorce.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.064
But nobody wants to hear that.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.651
People just want to hear about
this amazing marriage

27:31.652 --> 27:33.612
that I didn't actually have.

27:35.155 --> 27:37.156
And I'm trying to stay positive

27:37.157 --> 27:39.408
because people like me
better that way,

27:39.409 --> 27:41.410
but I just feel like
such a fake all the time.

27:41.411 --> 27:44.121
And you're so honest
about everything,

27:44.122 --> 27:47.668
and I just,
I wish I could be like you.

27:48.877 --> 27:51.128
- Shaw and Urwin?

27:51.129 --> 27:53.257
Tables six and seven.

29:12.294 --> 29:14.879
- I can't believe that
you're already dating again.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.173
- Ugh, I know.
It all happened so fast.

29:17.174 --> 29:19.842
I think I'm in love.
- Seriously, you got a dog?

29:19.843 --> 29:23.638
- Jules, get in here?
- Oh, that's not good.

29:23.639 --> 29:25.556
- You were supposed to watch
him while I took a shower.

29:25.557 --> 29:27.141
- I got distracted
for like a second.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.935
- But this is what I mean
by not responsible enough

29:28.936 --> 29:31.103
to own a dog.
- I'd like to talk to you

29:31.104 --> 29:34.273
about something.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.067
- Mm-kay.

29:36.068 --> 29:38.027
- What they told me in rehab
is the hardest part

29:38.028 --> 29:40.196
about staying sober
is the fact that

29:40.197 --> 29:43.115
the people in your life don't
believe you can change.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.327
But I didn't think
that'd be you guys.
