17:22.919 --> 17:24.545
BULLET: But Leroy said that uh...

17:24.753 --> 17:27.339
Kane has something big
going down in the A.M.

17:27.548 --> 17:30.843
So it looks like we'll
be doing an all-nighter.

17:31.052 --> 17:34.055

art studio downtown.

17:34.263 --> 17:39.310

gorilla, not the monkey.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.021
One animal at a time, Captain.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.649
CAPTAIN BLANCHE: (LAUGHS)

17:47.902 --> 17:50.446
ESTES: Man, yöu really had Leroy
snitchin' like a little bitch.

17:50.655 --> 17:52.073
BULLET: All day, brother.

17:52.281 --> 17:54.617
(MEN LAUGH)

18:06.045 --> 18:07.880
Detective, I want to see
what my client just signed.

18:08.089 --> 18:09.590
Wait a minute.
What'd yöu just say?

18:09.799 --> 18:13.511
I said I want to see what
my client just signed.

18:13.719 --> 18:17.181
Wow. Leroy must be doing
pretty well for himself.

18:17.390 --> 18:18.266
Pricey lawyer like yöu...

18:18.474 --> 18:20.101
Don't fuck with me, Marasco.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.520
Yöu had no business having
him sign an affidavit

18:22.728 --> 18:23.771
without me there.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.982
He signed it on his own.

18:26.190 --> 18:30.111
Look, the affidavit is on file
at the clerk's office.

18:30.319 --> 18:33.114
Yöu want a copy, I'm sure
they'll give it to yöu.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.241
But as for me...

18:36.492 --> 18:38.703
I'm running late, sweetheart.

18:38.911 --> 18:40.830
Merde!

18:45.793 --> 18:47.878
Special Agent Daehn.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.843
So what can we do for yöu,
Special Agent Daehn?

18:54.051 --> 18:56.012
I'm here to talk about
the ongoing investigation

18:56.220 --> 18:58.514
of the Kane cartel.

18:58.723 --> 19:00.766
BULLET: What, the feds need our help?

19:00.975 --> 19:04.061
Usually us local cops
are in the way.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.397
Well, actually the Attorney
General wants to investigate

19:06.605 --> 19:09.984
new evidence that might lead
to Manuel Kane's innocence.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.819
Yöu took him down, detective.

19:12.028 --> 19:13.988
Do yöu have any idea what
this evidence could be?

19:14.196 --> 19:15.323
Sure...

19:15.531 --> 19:17.199
Non-existent.

19:17.408 --> 19:20.870
I caught Kane red-handed.
He's guilty as hell.

19:21.078 --> 19:26.208
And the men he killed...
were good cops and friends.

19:26.417 --> 19:30.755
Okay, well, this could just be a
last-ditch legal effort, but...

19:30.963 --> 19:34.550
...we'd still like to review any
files yöu may have on Kane.

19:34.759 --> 19:39.138
All my files on Kane...
they're all up here. Heh.

19:39.347 --> 19:43.184
And no psych in his right mind
would go in there unarmed.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.478
Okay, well um...

19:45.686 --> 19:49.106
Would yöu mind if I shadowed
him on the investigation?

19:49.315 --> 19:53.027
I hear yöu have quite
the reputation, detective.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.363
Look, shadow me all yöu want.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.866
But when I turn a corner,
my shadow disappears.

19:59.075 --> 20:00.910
And I ain't no
fuckin' babysitter.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.579
So, we're on then at twelve.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.165
Stay in yöur own lane, Agent.

20:06.374 --> 20:08.292
Special Agent.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.842
Is he always this grumpy?

20:17.051 --> 20:21.806
Grumpy? He was
actually in a good mood.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.307
Great.

20:23.516 --> 20:24.683
Well, thank yöu.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.387
I'd like to speak to
this man privately, please.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.103
Yöu listen to me clearly.

21:10.646 --> 21:12.898
Yöu can tell yöur father

21:13.107 --> 21:16.068
that if anything
happens to my daughter,

21:16.277 --> 21:19.780
I will personally
escort yöu both to hell.

21:19.989 --> 21:25.828
I will track yöu down using
my last penny to the last day.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.705
Like the dogs that yöu are.

21:27.913 --> 21:31.584
And I don't care if
they have to execute me.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.545
I've accepted my fate.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.672
Have yöu, Governor?

21:36.881 --> 21:40.926
My daughter... is my
whole world to me.

21:41.135 --> 21:42.511
It's a dangerous man,

21:42.720 --> 21:47.433
whose very meaning for
existence is threatened.

21:47.641 --> 21:49.018
Remember that.

21:53.189 --> 21:55.316
Yes, Governor.

21:55.524 --> 21:58.194
And yöu remember...

21:58.402 --> 22:00.613
My father and I...

22:00.821 --> 22:03.782
We're the only bloodline
left in this shit world.

22:03.991 --> 22:08.662
Yöu do yöur part,
we all get what we want.

22:10.623 --> 22:12.750

22:13.792 --> 22:15.377
Yes.

22:16.879 --> 22:19.173
MANUEL: Good.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.343
Soon yöu'll get the information
yöu need to release me.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.887
Guards! Get me out of here.

22:38.943 --> 22:42.196
Great art claims
to understand death.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.697
But, y'know...

22:43.906 --> 22:48.619
It's not until yöu've looked
down the barrel of a gun...

22:48.827 --> 22:53.040
...that yöu truly understand
the meaning of death.

22:53.249 --> 22:55.918
This country was founded
by thieves and murderers,

22:56.126 --> 22:58.420
religious fanatics..
social misfits.

22:58.629 --> 23:02.216
But yöu know what those misfits
did, the first chance they got?

23:02.424 --> 23:05.970
They dumped their Bible
and picked up a gun.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.430
This country is built
on the barrel of a gun,

23:08.639 --> 23:10.975
not a fucking constitution.

23:11.183 --> 23:14.937
There shouldn't be stars on
the flag, there should be guns.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.648
We are the poor with guns.

23:17.856 --> 23:23.487

and we will fuck yöu up!
