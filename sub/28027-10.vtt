LAST WEEK TONIGHT
WITH JOHN OLIVER

00:25.230 --> 00:27.170
SEASON VI
EPISODE 10

00:30.010 --> 00:33.020
Welcome to Last Week Tonight.

00:33.060 --> 00:36.000
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you for joining us.

00:36.020 --> 00:39.100
A quick recap of the week.
We begin in Washington,

00:39.120 --> 00:43.120
where Bill Barr failed to turn up
to a congressional hearing,

00:43.140 --> 00:46.210
an act that prompted
this prop comedy.

00:47.170 --> 00:51.180
Congressman Steve Cohen munched
on a bucket of fried chicken

00:51.210 --> 00:55.200
and flaunted a ceramic chicken
to drive his point home.

00:56.030 --> 00:58.120
What is the message
you're trying to send?

00:58.140 --> 01:00.080
Bill Barr is a chicken.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.410
Yeah, we get it.
You've made that painfully obvious.

01:06.330 --> 01:09.470
It gets more pathetic, because
the hearing was at 9:30 A.M.

01:09.510 --> 01:14.540
The nearest KFC didn't open until
10:30 and Cohen admitted

01:14.560 --> 01:19.320
he bought the chicken the night
before and kept it in his fridge.

01:19.370 --> 01:25.320
Which is just tragic.
He's biting into leftover KFC

01:25.340 --> 01:27.500
or, as it's more commonly
known, trash.

01:28.370 --> 01:32.420
That means this adult man
probably laid in bed all night

01:32.440 --> 01:36.460
thinking about how awesome
his joke was going to be.

01:36.540 --> 01:41.450
He was wrong about that.
The grandstanding nonsense didn't stop,

01:41.470 --> 01:44.550
because Republican Thom Tillis
decided to go on the attack.

01:45.370 --> 01:49.370
This guy didn't even have good enough
sense to have Bojangles' chicken.

01:49.390 --> 01:53.350
They've got the chair and others
letting him have that kind of theater

01:53.380 --> 01:55.510
in a House Committee room.

01:56.420 --> 02:01.500
It's pathetic theater to eat KFC.
But not to rush to Kinko's

02:02.070 --> 02:06.070
and laminate a poster image
of someone eating KFC.

02:06.110 --> 02:10.100
I do realize we've just shown
a lot of KFC on our show,

02:10.120 --> 02:12.220
which might encourage them
to send us some.

02:12.240 --> 02:15.190
Please do not send us anything.

02:16.050 --> 02:19.050
We do not want your weird
fried pigeon parts,

02:19.200 --> 02:24.220
nor your bowls of whatever someone
shit out after they ate the pigeon.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.200
Your items are not welcome.
Let's not focus on U.S. politics.

02:29.220 --> 02:33.280
Let's turn to Australia, the country
that brought you Yellow Tail wine,

02:34.060 --> 02:35.160
the party gift that says:

02:35.210 --> 02:39.150
"Thanks for the invite, but your
friendship is not reciprocated."

02:40.140 --> 02:43.040
Australia has a federal election
on May 18th

02:43.070 --> 02:46.080
and their campaign
is less than a month old,

02:46.110 --> 02:49.150
but there's already been a
ridiculous amount of scandals.

02:49.190 --> 02:53.130
Steve Dickson, a leader in the far
right One Nation Party,

02:53.150 --> 02:56.280
got in trouble when footage
surfaced of him at a U.S. strip club.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.210
The secret video shows
the happily married politician

03:00.230 --> 03:03.240
groping dancers and asking them
to come home with him.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.850
It's a bad look and very
bad judgment from a man

03:06.870 --> 03:08.970
who campaigns on family values.

03:09.930 --> 03:12.950
I love the fact that she mentioned
that this was a bad look

03:12.970 --> 03:15.050
because he campaigned
on family values,

03:15.840 --> 03:18.910
as if the worst part of groping people
in a strip club

03:18.930 --> 03:21.000
was that he wasn't behaving
"on brand".

03:21.060 --> 03:24.930
Sure, he's a married man at
a strip club, groping the dancers,

03:24.950 --> 03:29.850
but why wasn't his wife and children
with him in a sticky booth?

03:29.880 --> 03:31.940
That would have made
all this fine.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.040
Sexual Harassment Dundee here
is by no means

03:36.060 --> 03:39.860
the only spectacular implosion
of this campaign.

03:39.890 --> 03:42.840
A shocking number of candidates
have got in trouble

03:42.870 --> 03:46.060
over offensive social media posts:
this one for anti-Muslim posts,

03:46.080 --> 03:49.030
for anti-Semitic posts,
for homophobic remarks,

03:49.060 --> 03:52.060
this one for a rape joke,
and this one, Ross MacDonald,

03:52.080 --> 03:55.980
for a plethora of lewd photos
he posted to his own Facebook,

03:56.000 --> 04:00.030
including a photo of himself grabbing
a woman's breasts in a Thailand bar.

04:00.050 --> 04:03.070
Which I'd say is the grossest
thing on his Facebook page,

04:03.860 --> 04:06.940
were it not for a post labeled
"MMMM! Interesting thoughts"

04:06.960 --> 04:12.870
attached to this photo of a woman
Photoshopped to look like a horse.

04:12.940 --> 04:17.040
I do not think she should have been
disqualified from the Kentucky Derby.

04:17.920 --> 04:22.019
You ran a good race, sexy naked horse
lady. On to the Preakness for you.

04:23.070 --> 04:26.930
The most eye-catching candidate
is Clive Palmer,

04:26.950 --> 04:29.060
head of his own
"United Australia Party".

04:29.080 --> 04:33.060
A brash businessman with a populist,
anti-establishment platform.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.850
If that's reminding you of someone,

04:35.870 --> 04:38.080
wait till you hear him yelling
at a news anchor.

04:38.990 --> 04:43.860
We've gotta stop about the fake news,
people attacking individuals.

04:43.890 --> 04:46.960
My wealth's $4000 million,
do you think I give a stuff

04:47.030 --> 04:49.990
about what you personally think
or anyone else?

04:50.030 --> 04:51.930
I care about this country!

04:51.950 --> 04:54.860
God bless Australia.
Put Australians first!

04:55.020 --> 04:58.920
That's all pretty Trumpy.
Arrogance? Check.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.850
Red tie? Check. He even has
billboards with his campaign slogan

05:02.870 --> 05:04.010
"Make Australia Great".

05:04.550 --> 05:08.560
Which notably doesn't say
"Make Australia Great Again".

05:09.540 --> 05:12.660
Let's not rewrite history here.
We are, and have always been,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.540
a big baking rock full
of huge spiders.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.520
We're looking to go up from here.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.580
Make Australia great
for the first time.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.650
Palmer has positioned
himself as a political outsider,

05:24.670 --> 05:27.600
despite the fact he was elected
before, in 2013,

05:27.620 --> 05:30.620
and became a joke for being
the most absent politician

05:30.650 --> 05:34.640
and for this moment, where
he either fell asleep in Parliament,

05:34.660 --> 05:37.530
or realized he had to govern,

05:37.550 --> 05:40.590
and so just played possum
until the next election cycle.

05:40.620 --> 05:44.530
All you really need to know
about Clive Palmer

05:44.550 --> 05:46.740
is two of his most
eye-catching business ideas:

05:47.520 --> 05:51.640
his failed Jurassic Park-inspired
dinosaur park, "Palmersaurus".

05:51.680 --> 05:55.560
And then there's this idea that
he's been working on for years.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.570
The Titanic II will be
a ship of peace.

05:58.710 --> 06:01.660
It will sail from China
to South Hampton,

06:01.750 --> 06:05.620
from South Hampton to New York,
from New York to South Hampton.

06:05.940 --> 06:09.140
By learning from the lessons of
the past, the spirit of Rose and Jack,

06:09.160 --> 06:12.100
Romeo and Juliet
lives in all of us.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.960
The spirit of life, the spirit of love,
to dream the impossible dream.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.980
All of us live in time.
This is our moment,

06:20.040 --> 06:22.930
it's our turn
to board Titanic II.

06:23.030 --> 06:25.010
Titanic was the ship of dreams.

06:25.070 --> 06:28.150
Titanic II is the ship
where dreams will come true.

06:29.920 --> 06:34.150
That's an incredible idea,
coherently expressed. Pure gold.

06:34.950 --> 06:38.160
Except, I do have a few notes.
First, the Titanic, as a boat brand,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.110
is famous for two things:
being big and sinking.

06:41.130 --> 06:45.020
We have cruise ships that are
five times the size the Titanic was,

06:45.040 --> 06:47.060
so that just leaves
the sinking part.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.110
I'm not sure how Titanic II constitutes
"learning the lessons of the past",

06:51.130 --> 06:55.120
when one of those lessons is sitting
at the bottom of the North Atlantic.

06:55.140 --> 06:57.980
Why is one of those lessons
"Jack and Rose",

06:58.000 --> 07:01.040
not historical figures,
neither are "Romeo and Juliet",

07:01.060 --> 07:03.110
which have as much
to do with the Titanic

07:03.130 --> 07:05.940
as the Titanic has to do
with Australia?

07:06.030 --> 07:09.210
Their spirits don't live in anyone.
Had they lived, they'd be dead,

07:09.230 --> 07:12.060
along with everyone else
on the Titanic.

07:12.090 --> 07:16.210
And fifth, the Titanic II.
That's your name?

07:17.010 --> 07:19.160
The Titanic had
two identical sister ships

07:19.190 --> 07:21.190
and do you know
what they were called?

07:21.220 --> 07:23.200
Something a lot better than that!

07:24.020 --> 07:29.110
Clive Palmer's Titanic II project
is representative

07:29.130 --> 07:32.100
of his entire political
platform in this election.

07:32.120 --> 07:36.040
He's unlikely to win many seats,
his pitch seems to be:

07:36.060 --> 07:40.120
"Let's take a historic disaster
and for some reason, do it again,"

07:40.140 --> 07:43.220
"only somehow dumber, worse,
and in Australia this time."

07:44.210 --> 07:46.100
And now, this.

07:47.130 --> 07:51.020
If You Live In Texas,
Lawyer Jim Adler

07:51.040 --> 07:53.160
Would Like A Perfectly Normal
Word With You.

07:55.010 --> 07:58.060
Greedy insurance companies
play dirty. Bring it on.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.080
I'm Jim Adler.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.240
Their lawyers will do their
tricky best to give you zero.

08:04.060 --> 08:07.090
Unacceptable!
I'm Jim Adler, the Texas Hammer

08:07.400 --> 08:09.430
and I do my best
to bring 'em down!

08:09.490 --> 08:14.370
I get angrier than a junkyard dog!
I stand tough and carry a big hammer.

08:14.390 --> 08:15.450
I growl and bark.

08:15.470 --> 08:17.430
- Wake up!
- It's Hammer-time!

08:17.450 --> 08:19.440
I'm Jim Adler,
the Texas Hammer.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.470
And I'm Bill Adler,
the Texas Hammer!

08:21.490 --> 08:23.380
Smash 'em with two hammers.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.440
Double down.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.520
Double the hammers,
double the justice.

08:26.550 --> 08:30.430
I fight for your medical bills,
paychecks, pain and suffering.

08:30.450 --> 08:33.500
- Jim Adler, Texas Hammer.
- Bill Adler, Texas Hammer.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.520
- We stand tough.
- And carry a big, big hammer.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.470
I thought so.

08:45.470 --> 08:51.360
Moving on. Our main story tonight
concerns the desert rain frog.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.420
If you think: "I don't
care about the desert rain frog",

08:54.440 --> 08:56.410
maybe this
will change your mind.

08:56.490 --> 09:02.380
This desert rain frog sounds
like a dog toy but actually,

09:02.400 --> 09:08.540
this is the sonorous war cry
of a very angry frog.

09:11.240 --> 09:15.250
How fucking great is that? That's
what it sounds like when it's mad!

09:15.280 --> 09:18.290
How does it sound when it's
happy? What a frog!

09:19.310 --> 09:22.220
Won't it be fun to learn
more about that tonight?

09:22.240 --> 09:24.210
We're not gonna be able to do that,

09:24.230 --> 09:27.270
because our actual main story
is about lethal injection.

09:27.290 --> 09:31.240
That's right, only three more episodes
with the greatest lead-in

09:31.260 --> 09:35.260
in modern television history and
I'm burning one on lethal injections.

09:36.180 --> 09:40.090
It's a subject that doesn't
come up very much

09:40.110 --> 09:42.130
because, frankly,
no one wants it to.

09:42.150 --> 09:45.280
Lethal injections aren't something
people want to think about.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.320
They happen frequently in America.

09:48.090 --> 09:50.180
There was one in Georgia
three nights ago.

09:50.210 --> 09:54.140
I know that there are differing
views on the death penalty.

09:54.170 --> 09:58.170
Some believe it's a deterrent to crime.
Some believe it's justice.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.190
And some, like Wyoming State
Senator Lynn Hutchings,

10:01.210 --> 10:04.160
believe it's justified for
the weirdest reason.

10:04.280 --> 10:10.180
The greatest man who ever lived
died via the death penalty

10:10.500 --> 10:11.720
for you and for me.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.480
I'm grateful to him for future
hope because of this.

10:16.620 --> 10:20.510
If it wasn't for Jesus dying
via the death penalty,

10:20.600 --> 10:22.580
we would all have no hope.

10:24.530 --> 10:27.560
Your argument for the death penalty

10:27.590 --> 10:30.630
is that it got us a Jesus once,
maybe one day,

10:30.650 --> 10:33.550
if we kill enough people,
we'll get another one?

10:33.690 --> 10:37.690
We'll get a bonus Jesus?
Let's keep rolling the dice,

10:37.710 --> 10:39.710
Papa needs
a new pair of Jesuses.

10:40.720 --> 10:45.570
My personal view on the death penalty
is different to that,

10:45.590 --> 10:47.630
I don't think
it should exist.

10:47.670 --> 10:50.700
There's no proof it has an effect
on bringing down crime,

10:50.720 --> 10:54.690
it's more expensive to execute
than to keep them in prison for life,

10:54.710 --> 10:56.640
and it's wrong.

10:56.700 --> 11:00.510
It's a bad thing the government
should not be able to do.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.720
Which makes my first two
points irrelevant there.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
Listing reasons
you don't support it

11:05.520 --> 11:07.680
is like listing reasons
you'll not fuck your mom.

11:07.700 --> 11:12.670
We don't have much chemistry,
she lives 300 miles away,

11:13.280 --> 11:15.390
and, yeah, she's my mom.

11:16.460 --> 11:21.360
I understand it can be hard
to sympathize

11:21.380 --> 11:23.470
with people convicted
of heinous crimes.

11:24.240 --> 11:25.450
According to one study,

11:25.470 --> 11:29.260
4 percent of people sentenced
to death are innocent,

11:29.280 --> 11:32.420
which in itself should give us pause
about the whole enterprise.

11:32.440 --> 11:36.380
It's the equivalent of "it would make
things pretty weird with Dad."

11:36.400 --> 11:38.480
Not the main reason not to do
it, and yet,

11:39.250 --> 11:41.400
it should be disqualifying enough
on its own.

11:41.440 --> 11:47.260
Let's say that you don't care
and you support the death penalty.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.370
There's still the question
of how you do it.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.360
Lethal injection came into vogue

11:51.380 --> 11:54.350
because it was seen as a humane
and painless method.

11:54.370 --> 11:56.430
It gained popularity
four decades ago,

11:56.450 --> 12:00.470
as states started getting queasy about
the horrors of the electric chair.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.270
One senator from Louisiana
explained his vote to switch

12:04.290 --> 12:06.420
to lethal injection back then
pretty nicely.

12:06.460 --> 12:11.270
I am for capital punishment,
but there is a more humane way.

12:11.290 --> 12:13.440
I have seen evidence
in my committee this year.

12:14.060 --> 12:17.040
I've seen photos of persons
that were electrocuted

12:17.060 --> 12:19.200
and it is, I guess you would say,
kind of gross.

12:19.240 --> 12:23.150
This is probably a step
in the right direction.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.120
"Kind of gross?"

12:26.070 --> 12:29.160
The electric chair set some
people's heads on fire,

12:29.200 --> 12:32.040
so that's "kind of"
an understatement.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.240
Putting mayonnaise on pizza
is kind of gross.

12:35.190 --> 12:38.280
Otherwise cute dogs with large
erections are kind of gross.

12:39.210 --> 12:42.240
Frying a human being until
their body's a smoking husk

12:43.060 --> 12:44.130
is horrifying.

12:44.200 --> 12:48.190
Lethal injection was sold
as something akin to surgery,

12:48.210 --> 12:52.220
a medical procedure in which
a doctor helps a person go to sleep

12:52.240 --> 12:54.200
and then
they just don't wake up.

12:54.230 --> 13:00.040
However much we want that
to be the case, it just isn't.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.230
Let's start with the idea
it's medical.

13:02.270 --> 13:04.270
That is more than
a bit of a stretch.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.250
Injections aren't performed
by medical personnel,

13:07.280 --> 13:09.180
for a pretty obvious reason.

13:10.060 --> 13:14.230
In the US it violates ethical codes
for physicians to be involved.

13:14.870 --> 13:17.940
So usually the people who are
involved in the executions

13:17.960 --> 13:21.000
are not physicians, and they
are not properly trained

13:21.040 --> 13:23.990
to do an IV insertion,
much less an execution.

13:24.900 --> 13:28.010
Yeah, of course!
Anyone who's been properly trained

13:28.030 --> 13:30.920
to perform a procedure
like a lethal injection

13:30.940 --> 13:32.970
has also been trained
never to do that.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.870
Hippocrates didn't say:

13:34.890 --> 13:37.900
"First, do no harm.
Second do some harm."

13:38.930 --> 13:42.010
The exclusion of medical personnel
extends to the design

13:42.040 --> 13:44.810
of our lethal-injection process.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.950
It wasn't developed
by scientists in a lab.

13:46.980 --> 13:50.830
It came about when legislators
in Oklahoma tried to figure out

13:50.850 --> 13:54.040
how to do it, and couldn't get
any doctors to work with them.

13:54.820 --> 13:57.960
They turned to the state's
medical examiner Jay Chapman,

13:57.980 --> 14:00.970
who warned them that:
"He was an expert in dead bodies"

14:00.990 --> 14:03.860
"but not an expert in getting
them that way."

14:04.010 --> 14:07.000
But he did helped them anyway!
So he wasn't an expert,

14:07.020 --> 14:10.890
just an enthusiast with
a can-do attitude for killing people.

14:11.030 --> 14:16.860
Lethal injection is being
administered by amateurs.

14:17.060 --> 14:21.090
We're very much not under
the best of circumstances.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.100
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to understand

14:24.120 --> 14:27.140
some of the specifics
of how lethal injections work.

14:27.180 --> 14:30.040
While the actual
protocol varies,

14:30.080 --> 14:32.190
most administer
drugs in three steps:

14:32.230 --> 14:36.060
first, they give an anesthetic
to put the inmate to sleep.

14:36.090 --> 14:39.240
A paralytic to stop the limbs
from moving around.

14:39.270 --> 14:43.250
There's no medical reason, it's for
the benefit of the people watching,

14:43.280 --> 14:49.040
so that they won't see a body flail as
the 3rd drug initiates cardiac arrest.

14:49.080 --> 14:54.260
The second and third drug
in this procedure are both,

14:54.280 --> 14:56.210
in their own ways,
horrifying.

14:57.040 --> 15:01.060
The third drug apparently feels like
"fire being poured into your veins."

15:01.080 --> 15:04.200
And even the second drug,
for the benefit of onlookers,

15:04.220 --> 15:07.280
is nightmarish, if you are
not completely knocked out.

15:08.160 --> 15:12.220
If the inmate is not unconscious and
the inmate receives a second drug

15:12.270 --> 15:17.110
that paralyzes the muscles,
that is a horrible situation

15:17.340 --> 15:21.550
where you are awake but you can
not move, you cannot breathe.

15:22.430 --> 15:25.320
So you have the sensation
of suffocating

15:25.350 --> 15:29.350
and you can't communicate
to anybody.

15:29.530 --> 15:33.410
You could be fully aware,
feel like you're suffocating,

15:33.430 --> 15:35.420
but unable to move
or communicate,

15:35.440 --> 15:38.390
while fire is about to be injected
into your veins.

15:38.430 --> 15:42.510
This qualifies as more humane
than an electric chair.

15:42.550 --> 15:48.490
It's like saying: "Which movie
has sexier CGI characters?"

15:48.520 --> 15:50.500
"Zootopia" or "Monsters, Inc.?"

15:50.540 --> 15:54.460
Probably "Monsters, Inc.,"
but it's not clear-cut,

15:55.350 --> 15:57.540
and the question in and of itself
is disturbing.

15:58.380 --> 16:01.340
If steps two
and three are torture,

16:01.370 --> 16:04.490
the first drug becomes
critically important.

16:04.540 --> 16:08.430
In theory, it's supposed to keep
you from feeling the other two.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.420
We used to use a drug for this
called sodium thiopental.

16:12.470 --> 16:14.560
But it stopped being made
here in 2011

16:15.340 --> 16:18.420
and it's no longer approved
by the FDA for import.

16:18.750 --> 16:22.720
Although some states have tried
to weasel around that restriction.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.880
Five years ago, when Arizona
needed drugs to execute

16:25.900 --> 16:29.810
an inmate named Jeffrey Landrigan,
it purchased them illegally

16:29.830 --> 16:33.790
from a supplier operating out
of this driving school in London.

16:33.920 --> 16:39.890
That is the most lethal thing
to come out of a British driving school

16:39.910 --> 16:41.750
since Prince Phillip.

16:42.870 --> 16:47.770
Even when that supply got cut off,
states didn't give up.

16:47.790 --> 16:50.930
They looked for replacement drugs.
Texas tried buying them

16:50.950 --> 16:54.940
from both a supplier in India
that also made illegal party pills,

16:55.730 --> 16:58.820
and having them custom-made
by a small independent pharmacy

16:58.840 --> 17:00.890
which also operated
as a gift shop.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.829
Which is just perfect if you
want to pick up execution drugs,

17:04.859 --> 17:07.770
but also give the inmate
a goodbye gift.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.960
An oven mitt with googly eyes?
You shouldn't have, Barbara.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.920
You really shouldn't have.
What is wrong with you?

17:17.770 --> 17:20.890
Most states have given up
on sodium thiopental,

17:21.420 --> 17:25.430
and instead they use
a drug called midazolam,

17:25.470 --> 17:29.450
which is a sedative,
not a general anesthetic.

17:29.490 --> 17:32.610
So it relaxes you, but doesn't
do anything to stop pain.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.420
One expert has called it
a "martini in a syringe",

17:36.510 --> 17:39.410
which sounds like A:
James bond's rock bottom,

17:39.480 --> 17:43.630
and B: not nearly enough if
I'm about to feel suffocated

17:44.400 --> 17:45.560
with fire in my veins.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.530
When called upon in court to
justify using a sedative

17:49.550 --> 17:55.420
during a procedure this painful,
states have relied exclusively

17:55.450 --> 17:57.550
on this man:
Dr. Roswell Lee Evans.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.470
He's testified as the key expert
witness in favor of midazolam

18:01.490 --> 18:06.430
on behalf of six different states,
even though he's not a doctor.

18:06.450 --> 18:09.620
He got his pharmacy doctorate
after 18 months of post-grad study,

18:10.400 --> 18:12.460
before midazolam even existed

18:12.500 --> 18:15.630
and has been working as a college
administrator since 1994.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.470
And if you're thinking:
"How do you know

18:18.490 --> 18:22.590
he's not been researching midazolam
since then?"

18:23.210 --> 18:27.200
Watch this sequence of questions
he answered during a deposition.

18:27.390 --> 18:32.190
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of midazolam?

18:33.230 --> 18:34.250
No.

18:34.350 --> 18:38.250
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of diazepam?

18:38.380 --> 18:39.390
No.

18:40.170 --> 18:43.340
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of lorazepam?

18:44.250 --> 18:45.260
No.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.360
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of propofol?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.320
No.

18:51.340 --> 18:56.390
Have you been involved in research
involving the use of pentobarbital?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.390
No.

18:59.160 --> 19:03.170
In research regarding
the use of sodium thiopental?

19:03.390 --> 19:04.400
No.

19:05.200 --> 19:10.180
Have you been involved in research
regarding the use of halothane gas?

19:10.360 --> 19:11.380
No.

19:12.160 --> 19:17.330
Have you been involved in research
regarding anesthetics of any sort?

19:17.350 --> 19:18.370
No.

19:19.330 --> 19:23.190
Two things are clear:
one, that guy is not an expert

19:23.300 --> 19:25.420
on anything he's supposed
to be an expert on.

19:25.450 --> 19:29.320
And two: there's a lot of overlap
between the names of sedatives

19:29.350 --> 19:32.440
and the names of alien races
in selfpublished sci-fi novels.

19:32.460 --> 19:36.320
I could imagine a book in which
Midazolam unite with Lorazepam

19:36.340 --> 19:39.500
to fight the evil Halothane and
their minions the Pentobarbital.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.450
I might not have to imagine that,
it's probably been optioned by HBO

19:43.470 --> 19:46.330
in their upcoming
"Game of Space-Thrones."

19:46.450 --> 19:51.330
In two weeks time,
this network is so deeply fucked.

19:52.370 --> 19:58.490
It gets even worse: because
when this shaved Santa testified

19:58.510 --> 20:01.330
in support of using midazolam

20:01.360 --> 20:04.280
in a case that went before
the Supreme Court,

20:04.320 --> 20:08.420
a full half of his 300-page expert
witness report consisted

20:08.440 --> 20:10.470
of printouts from Drugs.com.

20:11.310 --> 20:15.370
Drugs.com is a highly useful
resource for information.

20:15.390 --> 20:18.360
Specifically, information
like this disclaimer:

20:18.380 --> 20:22.450
"This is not intended for medical
advice, diagnosis or treatment."

20:23.290 --> 20:28.450
No wonder that many inmates
do not want midazolam to be used.

20:28.470 --> 20:31.510
In Arizona, some of them
sued over exactly this

20:32.290 --> 20:35.430
and the Department of Corrections
hit on an ingenious solution,

20:35.450 --> 20:39.520
saying that inmates could bring
their own execution drugs.

20:40.410 --> 20:44.340
Which is pretty difficult,
with those drugs being restricted

20:44.360 --> 20:46.470
and those prisoners
being in prison.

20:47.510 --> 20:51.400
It's telling a one-year-old
to provide his own birthday cake.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.470
How the fuck
am I supposed to do that?

20:54.360 --> 20:56.390
I don't have the money.
I can't drive.

20:56.410 --> 20:59.460
I can't even get out of this chair.
And I'm somehow supposed

20:59.480 --> 21:02.320
to obtain my own fucking
Fudgie the Whale?

21:02.450 --> 21:09.290
This is the worst birthday
I've ever had. Unbelievable!

21:11.420 --> 21:15.340
When the head of Arizona's
Department of Corrections

21:15.360 --> 21:19.350
was pressed on that plan,
he identified the problem.

21:19.490 --> 21:22.490
You've never heard of a prisoner
on death row in Arizona

21:22.510 --> 21:27.330
purchasing federally regulated drugs
for use in their own execution!

21:28.570 --> 21:29.600
No.

21:29.690 --> 21:32.600
Have you heard of any prisoner
ever doing that?

21:33.580 --> 21:34.590
Not yet.

21:35.670 --> 21:39.520
Not yet! No one in the history
of America has ever done this,

21:39.540 --> 21:41.580
but I think our inmates
can pull it off!

21:41.680 --> 21:46.500
It is sweet how much he believes in
the people he's putting to death.

21:46.590 --> 21:51.660
I've held off on describing
specific cases to you.

21:51.680 --> 21:56.570
But there are many examples
that show how terribly things can go

21:56.590 --> 21:59.580
when all the factors you've
seen come together.

21:59.610 --> 22:03.560
The list of botched executions
is long, and it is horrendous,

22:03.590 --> 22:06.620
but let's take just one of them:
Clayton Lockett.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.720
In 2014, Oklahoma made him

22:09.500 --> 22:12.520
one of the first to be executed
using midazolam.

22:12.590 --> 22:15.610
Right from the start,
things did not go as planned.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.620
Executing Clayton Lockett with
a new three-drug combination

22:19.640 --> 22:20.710
took 43 minutes.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.700
A phlebotomist tried inserting
needles into Lockett's forearms,

22:24.720 --> 22:26.690
neck, foot, groin and buttocks.

22:26.710 --> 22:31.510
Minutes after the execution began,
Lockett's attorney, there as a witness,

22:31.620 --> 22:34.630
says his client kept trying
to raise up and even said:

22:34.660 --> 22:35.790
"Something's wrong."

22:36.630 --> 22:40.840
They wanted to hurry up with
as little transparency as possible.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.740
This is what they get.

22:43.620 --> 22:44.830
Yeah, that attorney is right.

22:45.610 --> 22:49.640
He's late for a gig as a Penn Jillette
impersonator, but he's right.

22:49.720 --> 22:53.840
What happened in that room was
incredibly gruesome

22:54.620 --> 22:57.720
and the investigation revealed
how ill-prepared

22:57.740 --> 23:00.750
the people administering
the injection really were.

23:00.770 --> 23:05.740
The drugs were not delivered into
his vein. They went into the tissue.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.830
There were no backup drugs.
There was no emergency plan.

23:11.810 --> 23:13.790
Regarding the use of midazolam,

23:13.840 --> 23:16.790
Mike Oakley from the Corrections
Department said:

23:16.820 --> 23:21.640
"I looked on-line. Went past the
key Wiki leaks or whatever it is,"

23:21.660 --> 23:25.630
"and I did find out midazolam would
render a person unconscious."

23:25.700 --> 23:27.620
"So we thought it was okay."

23:28.630 --> 23:32.740
They looked up midazolam
on "Wiki leaks or whatever".

23:33.240 --> 23:37.300
Which is just not ideal, is it?
To make sure that doesn't happen again,

23:37.320 --> 23:40.160
we bought
"Wikileaksorwhatever.com",

23:40.210 --> 23:42.210
which is now a large banner reading

23:42.230 --> 23:44.400
"Midazolam Doesn't Keep You
From Feeling Pain."

23:45.180 --> 23:47.200
"Please Stop Using It
In Executions."

23:47.270 --> 23:53.190
We also added that frog.
Just to cut the tension a little bit.

23:53.230 --> 23:56.210
If you click on him,
he squeaks! See?

23:56.380 --> 24:01.310
He's angry about executions
as he well should be. What a frog!

24:03.240 --> 24:08.240
Lethal injection actually has
the highest botch rate of any method.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.340
Last year, two inmates
in Tennessee requested

24:11.360 --> 24:15.210
and were executed by
the electric chair

24:15.270 --> 24:18.180
because they believed
it would be less painful.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.160
In our desire to find
a more humane method,

24:21.180 --> 24:25.380
we've let amateurs invent and
administer an unpredictable torture.

24:26.200 --> 24:30.330
Even ardent supporters of the death
penalty, like this federal judge,

24:30.360 --> 24:34.390
will acknowledge that lethal injection
isn't what we'd like to think it is.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.170
Use of lethal injection is a way
of lying to ourselves

24:40.100 --> 24:44.090
to make it look like execution's
a peaceful, a benign,

24:44.250 --> 24:49.130
sort of like going to sleep,
and they're not.

24:49.200 --> 24:54.260
You have proposed alternatives.
You prefer firing squad.

24:54.280 --> 24:59.090
- Never fails.
- But you also said the guillotine?

24:59.150 --> 25:01.310
- That's right.
- Really? The guillotine?

25:02.260 --> 25:05.130
It's 100 percent effective.

25:05.300 --> 25:10.310
Sure, but...
First of all there:

25:11.100 --> 25:14.320
I wish that Lesley Stahl had been
around during the French Revolution.

25:15.090 --> 25:17.080
Really? The guillotine?
Come on.

25:17.270 --> 25:21.180
Robespierre, look at me.
Look at your old friend Lesley.

25:22.210 --> 25:24.260
Come on.

25:25.180 --> 25:28.140
If hearing a federal
judge endorse the guillotine

25:28.160 --> 25:30.320
makes you uncomfortable,
wait until you find out

25:31.090 --> 25:34.130
he stepped down in the wake of
sexual misconduct claims.

25:34.150 --> 25:37.080
Leaving me in the unenviable
position of saying:

25:37.100 --> 25:40.270
that MeToo'ed judge who thinks
we should be cutting off more heads

25:40.290 --> 25:43.100
makes some pretty
interesting points.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.230
The hard truth here is:

25:44.280 --> 25:48.200
there is no perfect way for
the government to kill people.

25:48.260 --> 25:51.110
You're probably thinking
of alternatives.

25:51.130 --> 25:55.150
What about assisted suicide? Can't
we do the same thing with executions?

25:55.170 --> 25:58.250
It's harder to kill a healthy person
than someone near death.

25:58.280 --> 26:02.120
Doctors and drug companies won't
be involved in executions.

26:02.140 --> 26:05.210
What about overdosing
them on opioids?

26:05.250 --> 26:08.250
We've tried that
and one execution took two hours,

26:08.270 --> 26:11.190
with the inmate gulping
like a fish out of water.

26:11.210 --> 26:14.290
What about cyanide?
We tried cyanide gas in 1992,

26:14.320 --> 26:18.210
the attorney general vomited
and the prison warden claimed

26:18.230 --> 26:21.120
he'd resign if forced
to conduct another one.

26:21.140 --> 26:25.200
I could list methods all night long.
The latest idea is nitrogen gas,

26:25.230 --> 26:29.190
which seems like it's got problems
of its own, but at the end of the day,

26:29.210 --> 26:33.080
coming up with different ideas
to do this, is a bit like coming up

26:33.100 --> 26:36.270
with positions in which you'd feel
least guilty fucking your mom.

26:36.290 --> 26:40.250
Missionary? That's good for her
hips, but you're looking right at her.

26:40.780 --> 26:43.800
Standing up? Mom hates
standing for any length of time.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.790
Reverse cowmom?
That's probably your best bet,

26:46.810 --> 26:50.840
but it's appalling and you shouldn't
be fucking doing it In the first place!

26:50.860 --> 26:53.780
There's no way to do this
and make it okay!

26:55.830 --> 27:00.910
If the thing that's making you
comfortable with lethal injection

27:00.940 --> 27:03.790
is that it's humane,
it isn't.

27:03.980 --> 27:07.870
The fundamental fact to understand
is, it is a show.

27:08.770 --> 27:11.920
It is designed not to minimize
the pain of people being executed,

27:11.940 --> 27:15.950
but to maximize the comfort of those
who want to support the death penalty,

27:15.970 --> 27:18.770
without confronting
the reality of it.

27:18.830 --> 27:22.940
It's violent, brutal and will never be
anything other than that.

27:23.760 --> 27:26.890
You might say: "I don't care what
happens to death row inmates."

27:26.910 --> 27:27.990
"They're bad people."

27:28.770 --> 27:31.990
Lethal injection isn't about who
they are. It's about who we are.

27:32.890 --> 27:36.860
If, after everything you've heard,
you still think we should be

27:36.880 --> 27:40.770
the kind of society that tortures
people to death in this manner,

27:40.820 --> 27:42.930
we should be
like someone who looks at the list

27:42.960 --> 27:45.930
of reasons not to fuck their mom
and does it anyway.

27:46.030 --> 27:50.840
Which is a long way of me saying,
if we keep executing people

27:50.860 --> 27:55.890
by lethal injections or any other
method, we are real motherfuckers.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.830
And now this.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.960
If You Think Jim Adler Didn't Also
Do His Ads In Spanish,

28:05.000 --> 28:06.950
You Are Sorely Mistaken.

28:46.860 --> 28:50.810
That's our show, thanks for watching.
See you next week. Good night.

28:51.910 --> 28:54.020
