00:35.758 --> 00:38.655
Delivery boy, Philip J. Fry,
reporting for duty.

00:38.723 --> 00:41.137
Dr. Zoidberg,
soaking in brine.

00:41.206 --> 00:42.655
[ contented sigh]

00:46.826 --> 00:47.930
What is the meaning of this?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.171
We've got a delivery, people.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.171
Let's move, let's move.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.792
Woo, woo, woo, woo.

00:51.862 --> 00:53.103
Amy, mission profile.

00:54.826 --> 00:55.862
Interesting.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.517
Interesting.

00:58.585 --> 01:00.206
Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?

01:00.274 --> 01:01.689
Packed and ready, sir.

01:02.826 --> 01:04.000
What's this?

01:04.067 --> 01:05.448
This is the same toy
surprise I got last time.

01:05.516 --> 01:06.516
[ grunts]

01:06.585 --> 01:08.585
I can't work
under these conditions.

01:08.655 --> 01:10.585
And without me,
there is no mission.

01:10.655 --> 01:11.930
I amthe mission.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.481
We're back
from the mission.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.620
Wha-wha... you
went without me?

01:15.688 --> 01:18.171
You were looking up curse
words in the dictionary.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.688
It seemed like
a better use of your time.

01:20.757 --> 01:23.275
But... but I'm the delivery boy.

01:23.343 --> 01:25.481
Don't worry,
everything went fine.

01:25.551 --> 01:26.826
Better than usual.

01:26.896 --> 01:28.793
We got medals.

01:28.861 --> 01:29.930
Good work, team.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
We really pulled together
on this one.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.171
Whoo-hoo!

01:33.240 --> 01:34.171
[ clanks]

01:34.240 --> 01:36.793
They got medals.

01:45.448 --> 01:47.310
I'm real sorry
I missed the mission.

01:47.378 --> 01:48.412
I wasn't there

01:48.481 --> 01:49.516
and you might have needed me.

01:49.585 --> 01:50.551
Nope.

01:50.620 --> 01:51.516
But if I had
been there...

01:51.585 --> 01:52.516
Nope.

01:52.585 --> 01:53.861
Li...
Nope.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.171
Bender's great.
Nope.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.343
[ groans]

01:56.412 --> 01:57.723
Listen, Leela,
let me make it up

01:57.793 --> 01:59.585
by taking you out
for dinner tonight.

01:59.655 --> 02:00.620
Nope.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.275
I've got a date with Chaz.

02:02.343 --> 02:03.551
Chaz?!

02:03.620 --> 02:05.793
I met him at that
charity cockfight last week.

02:05.861 --> 02:07.310
He's the Mayor's aide.

02:07.379 --> 02:08.723
Ooh, you go, mutant girl.

02:08.793 --> 02:09.896
[ towel snaps]

02:09.965 --> 02:10.931
I do go.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.481
He's a very
important man.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.620
So? I'm just
as important as him.

02:16.965 --> 02:19.137
It's just that,
the kind of importance I have

02:19.205 --> 02:21.378
it doesn't matter
if I don't do it.

02:26.620 --> 02:27.758
[ purring]

02:27.826 --> 02:29.655
[ cooing]

02:29.723 --> 02:30.655
[ sighs]

02:30.723 --> 02:31.896
I'm nobody.

02:31.965 --> 02:33.343
There are guys
in the background

02:33.413 --> 02:35.826
of Mary Worth comics who
are more important than me.

02:35.896 --> 02:37.550
Aw, buck up, meatloaf.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.620
Bender will take you out
tonight and cheer you up.

02:39.688 --> 02:40.550
What do you want to do?

02:40.620 --> 02:41.620
And I mean anything.

02:41.688 --> 02:42.896
You have the power.

02:42.965 --> 02:44.413
Name it and I'm there.

02:44.481 --> 02:45.723
You the man.

02:45.793 --> 02:47.171
Well... okay.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.310
Let's go bowling.

02:48.378 --> 02:50.171
Nah.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.688
Table for two?

02:56.758 --> 02:57.930
Step right
this way.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.655
I'm afraid we don't have
a reservation

02:59.723 --> 03:01.310
but, um, as you can see

03:01.378 --> 03:02.826
I'm the Mayor's aide.

03:02.895 --> 03:04.620
Table for two, please.

03:04.688 --> 03:06.965
Okay then.

03:15.275 --> 03:16.343
Bam!

03:16.413 --> 03:17.793
It's okay, my man.

03:17.861 --> 03:20.620
I got you covered on your
next health inspection.

03:20.688 --> 03:23.343
Aw, I really appreciate that,
Mr. Mayor's aide.

03:23.413 --> 03:24.965
Here you go.

03:25.033 --> 03:26.550
Compliments of the house.

03:26.620 --> 03:29.688
Wow, free bread
at a restaurant.

03:29.758 --> 03:31.688
Is there anything
you can'tdo?

03:31.758 --> 03:33.481
I can't fail the Mayor.

03:33.550 --> 03:35.310
Not ever.

03:35.378 --> 03:36.930
Oh...

03:43.930 --> 03:45.448
[ bells clinking]

03:46.620 --> 03:48.240
Oh, geez,
better not let Leela see me.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.378
Hey, I hear Fry.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.688
Boy, am I glad
you're here.

03:52.758 --> 03:54.103
You are? So things
aren't working out

03:54.171 --> 03:55.343
with what's-his-name?

03:55.413 --> 03:57.620
Actually... they are.

03:57.688 --> 03:59.550
Confidentially,
I might not make it back

03:59.620 --> 04:00.895
to my apartment tonight.

04:00.965 --> 04:02.793
Could you walk Nibbler
for me?

04:02.861 --> 04:04.931
Uh... eh... mm... ah.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.240
And bring a baggie
in case he drops a steamer.

04:07.310 --> 04:08.826
Have a great night.

Wait, I'm trying.

It weighs as much
as a thousand suns.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.379
[ straining]

04:44.033 --> 04:45.000
Don't worry, Fry.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.172
I'll pull some strings

04:46.240 --> 04:47.930
see if I can't get
you tried as a juvenile.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.274
Oh, Chaz.

04:49.343 --> 04:53.000
[ both giggling]

04:53.757 --> 04:56.067
[ sighs]

04:58.793 --> 05:01.310
I'm as worthless
as this trash can.

05:03.240 --> 05:05.137
You think
I'm as worthless as you?

05:05.206 --> 05:07.033
Try catching garbage
in your head

05:07.103 --> 05:09.343
and raising six kids,
you dumb townie.

05:14.793 --> 05:17.689
Oh, Nibbler,
at least I'm important to you.

05:17.757 --> 05:20.343
Even if it's only
'cause I clean up your poop.

05:20.413 --> 05:24.103
The poop eradication is but
one aspect of your importance.

05:26.481 --> 05:27.723
[ shrieks]

05:27.793 --> 05:30.067
D-D-Did you just talk?

05:30.137 --> 05:31.310
Indeed.

05:31.379 --> 05:33.620
And I have other
amazing powers as well.

Welcome, Lord Nibbler.

At last, our centuries
upon centuries of waiting

have achieved fruition.

by a bunch of guinea pigs.

He does not know.

He knows not?

Knows not does he.

06:42.343 --> 06:44.033
Not he knows...
Enough!

06:44.103 --> 06:46.067
Fry, it is my duty
to inform you

06:46.137 --> 06:49.274
that the fate of humanity,
the fate of our race...

06:49.343 --> 06:53.586
indeed, the fate of all that
exists and ever will exist

06:53.654 --> 06:54.896
rests with you.

06:54.965 --> 06:57.481
You are the single
most important person

in the universe.

[ rumbling]

07:33.862 --> 07:35.103
The time has come

07:35.172 --> 07:38.137
to discuss matters
of the gravest importance.

07:39.206 --> 07:41.137
Fry, do you remember
some months ago

07:41.206 --> 07:43.447
when Earth was attacked
by flying brains?

07:43.516 --> 07:44.757
Hmm...

07:44.826 --> 07:46.447
I remember
the square-dancing stomachs--

07:46.516 --> 07:48.620
although that might have been
a Mylanta commercial.

07:48.689 --> 07:49.862
Wait, the brains.

07:49.930 --> 07:50.896
I doremember.

07:50.965 --> 07:51.965
But no one
else does.

07:52.033 --> 07:53.274
They said
I was crazy.

07:53.343 --> 07:54.723
On the contrary.

07:54.793 --> 07:56.896
You remember because
you were the only one immune

07:56.965 --> 07:58.413
to the brains' mental attack.

07:58.481 --> 07:59.481
Because I'm so smart?

07:59.550 --> 08:01.757
[ all laughing]

08:01.826 --> 08:03.274
Oh, my.

08:03.343 --> 08:05.896
Anyway, your immunity
is due to the fact

08:05.964 --> 08:08.240
that you lack
the delta brain wave.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.964
[ grunting]

08:10.033 --> 08:12.343
It's a genetic abnormality
which resulted

08:12.413 --> 08:15.654
when you went back in time
and performed certain actions

08:15.723 --> 08:17.793
which made you
your own grandfather.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.930
I did do the nasty
in the past-y.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.964
Verily.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.620
And that past-nastification

08:22.689 --> 08:24.757
is what shields you
from the brains.

08:24.826 --> 08:27.964
You are the last hope
of the universe.

08:28.033 --> 08:29.516
So I really am important?

08:29.586 --> 08:31.413
How I feel when I'm drunk
is correct?

08:31.481 --> 08:32.481
Yes.

For a thousand years

08:42.102 --> 08:45.136
the evil brains have been  constructing the "Info-Sphere"

a giant memory bank

08:46.481 --> 08:49.517
twice the size
of three ordinary memory banks.

08:49.586 --> 08:51.136
What's so evil
about that?

08:51.206 --> 08:53.931
They plan to collect all
the information in the universe

08:54.000 --> 08:55.551
and store it
within the sphere.

08:55.620 --> 08:56.758
So they're trying
to learn things?

08:56.826 --> 08:57.724
Right.

08:57.793 --> 08:58.931
Those bastards!

08:59.000 --> 09:00.240

to know everything.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.758
I'm as mad as I've ever been!

09:05.826 --> 09:07.447
Once their task is complete

09:07.517 --> 09:10.274
they will ensure that
no new information arises

in the only way possible--

09:11.931 --> 09:13.931

intense thinking.

09:56.758 --> 09:57.654
Sorry, what?

09:57.724 --> 09:58.826
I wasn't paying attention.

That is most wise.

19:42.586 --> 19:44.448
[ slurps]Ten...

19:44.517 --> 19:47.654
You really think I would've
had a chance with Leela?

19:47.723 --> 19:49.309
You must choose:...seven... six...

19:49.378 --> 19:51.136
the present
or the future.

19:51.205 --> 19:54.344
To save yourself
or save Leela.

19:54.413 --> 19:55.550
...two, one.

19:55.619 --> 19:57.517
[ tooting]

19:57.586 --> 19:59.172
[ blowing]

19:59.240 --> 20:00.413
[ Fry yelling]

20:00.481 --> 20:01.619
[ door slams]

20:01.689 --> 20:03.136
[ rapid beeping, single beep]

20:03.205 --> 20:04.240
[ electronic hiss]

20:04.309 --> 20:05.136
Yes!

20:05.205 --> 20:06.067
Here I come, future.

20:06.136 --> 20:07.378
Oh, no. Wait!

20:07.448 --> 20:09.964
I'm going to get trapped
in the Info-Sphere again.

20:10.034 --> 20:13.586
Just remember that
Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks...!

20:13.654 --> 20:16.172
[ voice fading]

20:16.240 --> 20:18.723
In a thousand years,
I'll get right on it.

20:18.792 --> 20:21.413
NARRATOR:
And so, a thousand years later

20:21.481 --> 20:24.344
Fry once again infiltrated
the Info-Sphere

20:24.413 --> 20:26.448
and set off his amazing bomb.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.448
Only this time...

20:28.517 --> 20:30.103
[ sucking hiss]

20:30.172 --> 20:31.654
[ whiny blip]

20:31.723 --> 20:34.000
[ heroic music plays]

20:37.895 --> 20:40.000
[ whooshing]

20:43.413 --> 20:47.103
Thank you for saving
the universe, Fry.

20:47.172 --> 20:48.240
Here.

20:48.309 --> 20:49.862
Oh, thanks.

20:49.931 --> 20:52.344
If you ever need a savior again,
just ask.

20:52.413 --> 20:54.586
[ squeaking]:Oh, we will.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.240
We will.

20:59.172 --> 21:02.067
Man, I can't wait to tell
everyone what happened.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.448
Yes.

21:03.517 --> 21:06.000
Incidentally,
I need to remain undercover

21:06.067 --> 21:07.792
so I'm blanking your memory.

21:07.862 --> 21:09.000
[ puff]

21:10.240 --> 21:12.413
Huh. Did everything
just taste purple

21:12.481 --> 21:13.378
for a second?

21:13.448 --> 21:14.654
Oh, well.

21:14.723 --> 21:17.103
Let's go home,
you dumb poop machine.

21:17.172 --> 21:19.550
[ jabbering]

21:21.654 --> 21:23.931
Bender, would you do
the honors?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.205
With gusto.

21:25.275 --> 21:26.862
[ burping]

21:30.826 --> 21:32.586
Hey, Leela.

21:32.654 --> 21:34.517
I guess I got
this for you.

21:34.586 --> 21:37.826
Oh. Thank you.

21:37.895 --> 21:38.862
You know what, Fry.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.172
I don't care
if you're not

21:40.240 --> 21:42.517
the most important person
in the universe.

21:42.586 --> 21:45.103
It really makes me happy
to see you right now.

21:45.172 --> 21:47.240
Then I amthe most
important person

21:47.309 --> 21:49.136
in the universe.

21:53.550 --> 21:55.205
FRY:
Yes!
