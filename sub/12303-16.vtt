00:09.924 --> 00:12.757
Let's get him!

00:15.258 --> 00:16.957
Get him! Get him!

00:17.024 --> 00:18.323
<i>You better run.</i>

00:18.390 --> 00:19.757
Head him off!
Head him off!

00:19.824 --> 00:21.124
Over there!

00:22.258 --> 00:23.690
We got him now.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.423
You can't
run forever!

00:29.423 --> 00:32.791
We're going to get you!

00:34.857 --> 00:36.757
He's trapped.

00:36.824 --> 00:38.258
Get him! Get him!

00:38.323 --> 00:39.624
We've got him!
We've got him, man!

00:56.957 --> 00:58.224
Who is he, Frank?

00:58.290 --> 00:59.590
According
to his I.D.,

00:59.657 --> 01:01.457
our victim's name
is Philip Gordon.

01:01.524 --> 01:03.857
Witness saw four men
chasing him.

01:03.924 --> 01:06.057
CAINE:
Four men.

01:06.124 --> 01:09.757
Philip certainly knows how
to draw a crowd, doesn't he?

01:09.824 --> 01:11.791
Yeah. I ran him.

01:11.857 --> 01:13.891
Turns out he's a registered
sex offender.

01:13.957 --> 01:16.624
Released from Westgate State
Prison less than a month ago.

01:16.690 --> 01:18.891
Well, that will
do it, won't it?

01:18.957 --> 01:20.590
Dead child molester.

01:20.657 --> 01:22.191
Some people might say
that's a problem

01:22.258 --> 01:23.624
that took care of itself.

01:23.690 --> 01:26.757
So he went from child molester
to murder victim.

01:26.824 --> 01:27.891
Alexx, you
know the area.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.557
Too well, Horatio.

01:29.624 --> 01:30.857
My kids play in this park.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.290
Did you know
you had

01:32.357 --> 01:34.158
a registered sex offender
in your neighborhood?

01:34.224 --> 01:35.891
Everybody did.
His face has been

01:35.957 --> 01:37.991
all over the Websites.

01:38.057 --> 01:40.457
The entire neighborhood
was up in arms over it.

01:40.524 --> 01:43.124
That certainly increases
the suspect pool, doesn't it?

01:43.191 --> 01:45.423
And the number of killers.

01:45.490 --> 01:47.590
This body is
badly beaten.

01:47.657 --> 01:50.158
I'm expecting to find
several more injuries

01:50.224 --> 01:52.124
<i>and broken bones.</i>

01:52.191 --> 01:55.258
Mob mentality can turn
a Boy Scout into a killer.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.557
And makes it hard to determine
which man killed him.

02:00.258 --> 02:02.124
Or maybe not.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.390
That's a stab wound.

02:05.457 --> 02:10.423
Alexx, that just narrowed us
down to one.

03:06.951 --> 03:08.417
Wait. Wait. Stop, guys.

03:08.484 --> 03:09.751
Hold on a second.

03:09.817 --> 03:11.851
Those are perfectly
round drops of blood.

03:11.917 --> 03:13.684
They're gravitational.

03:13.751 --> 03:16.017
Means he bled while
he was still standing, Alexx.

03:16.084 --> 03:18.751
<i>So he was stabbed
before he ran.</i>

03:22.151 --> 03:25.017
It also means
he left a blood trail.

03:25.084 --> 03:27.517
Thanks, guys.

04:35.450 --> 04:39.484
Eric, got anything?

04:39.550 --> 04:43.051
Yeah. I found this at the start
of the blood trail.

04:43.118 --> 04:44.984
Cell phone for kids.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.383
He wasn't supposed to be
within 100 feet of those kids.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.151
It doesn't look good
for him right now.

04:49.218 --> 04:51.517
That could explain
the attack, too.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.717
That should be easy
to find out.

04:53.784 --> 04:57.118
These phones, they speed dial
911 and the kids' parents.

04:57.184 --> 05:00.218
Let's do a reverse directory
on the parents.

05:01.684 --> 05:04.383
Name is Victor Terraza.

05:04.450 --> 05:07.218
And, uh... he lives
right around the corner.

05:08.717 --> 05:11.517
Some man tried to
grab my daughter.

05:11.584 --> 05:13.484
I yelled at the guy
to get him away from her,

05:13.550 --> 05:15.017
and I guess somebody heard me

05:15.084 --> 05:16.517
because a few guys
took off after him.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.017
I just grabbed Isabel
and ran home.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.218
Did you recognize
the man?

05:20.283 --> 05:23.417
No. I was just focused
on Isabel, you know?

05:23.484 --> 05:24.684
Would you mind
if I spoke to her?

05:24.751 --> 05:27.250
No. Go ahead.

05:32.584 --> 05:34.650
Isabel...

05:34.717 --> 05:37.184
hi.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.784
You want

05:38.851 --> 05:40.184
to tell me what happened?

05:40.250 --> 05:43.951
My tights got ripped.

05:44.017 --> 05:45.951
That's too bad,
isn't it?

05:46.017 --> 05:48.784
I told my dad I don't like
to wear dresses.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.218
I understand.

05:57.151 --> 06:00.584
Isabel, did
the man hurt you?

06:00.650 --> 06:03.984
Yeah. He made me fall down.

06:06.184 --> 06:08.084
Who brought you here?
What?

06:08.151 --> 06:09.817
Who did you
come here with?

06:09.884 --> 06:11.584
My daddy.

06:11.650 --> 06:14.118
<i>Where... where
is your daddy?</i>

06:14.184 --> 06:16.218
I don't know.

06:16.283 --> 06:19.151
Daddy, where are you?

06:20.484 --> 06:23.717
I screamed really loud
like Daddy taught me.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.417
And then he ran away?

06:29.118 --> 06:31.283
Thank you very much.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.851
I like your elephant.

06:36.051 --> 06:39.751
Mr. Terraza,

06:39.817 --> 06:42.717
how much time did
he spend with her?

06:43.951 --> 06:47.617
A few minutes? I don't know.

06:47.684 --> 06:50.851
I'm going to need to,
uh... process her.

06:50.917 --> 06:52.184
Process?

06:52.250 --> 06:54.417
She's got, as you
may have noticed,

06:54.484 --> 06:55.951
some blood on her dress.

07:07.517 --> 07:09.617
Boy, this guy
really took a beating.

07:09.684 --> 07:12.751
Yeah. But it was the running
that got him.

07:12.817 --> 07:14.283
The running?

07:14.350 --> 07:18.517
Yeah. The stab wound caused
massive internal bleeding,

07:18.584 --> 07:21.517
but the fatty tissue
sealed the laceration,

07:21.584 --> 07:23.250
containing the bleeding.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.517
<i>Now, this guy was going
to die either way,</i>

07:27.584 --> 07:29.317
<i>but the running sped it up.</i>

07:29.383 --> 07:32.450
<i>The physical exertion
accelerated his heart rate,</i>

07:32.517 --> 07:34.751
<i>filling his peritoneum
with blood.</i>

07:36.383 --> 07:38.851
Now, I also found some

07:38.917 --> 07:40.784
green material in his hair--

07:40.851 --> 07:43.717
like fibers.

07:43.784 --> 07:45.383
Yeah. The little girl
had that on her, too.

07:45.450 --> 07:48.817
When I processed her,
I sent it to Trace.

07:48.884 --> 07:50.817
Alexx, what is that

07:50.884 --> 07:52.383
on his cheek?

07:52.450 --> 07:54.884
Some kind of pattern.

07:54.951 --> 07:56.717
Like a shoeprint.

08:00.051 --> 08:01.550
Hey.

08:01.617 --> 08:02.817
Hey. What's up?

08:02.884 --> 08:04.317
Just dropping this off.

08:04.383 --> 08:06.650
It's a mysterious green fiber
from Philip's clothes.

08:06.717 --> 08:08.817
It's not a fiber.

08:08.884 --> 08:11.550
It's acrylamide polymer,
a.k.a. fertilizer.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.584
Wow. You're good.

08:13.950 --> 08:16.151
Not that good.
Calleigh found the
same stuff earlier.

08:16.217 --> 08:20.284
Fertilizer. Must have
gotten it during the fall?

08:20.351 --> 08:22.384
It's not just
any fertilizer.

08:22.451 --> 08:24.184
It's hydromulch
a mix of wood fibers

08:24.251 --> 08:26.451
and bonding agents used
to keep grass growing

08:26.518 --> 08:28.351
in areas with lots
of foot traffic.

08:28.418 --> 08:30.084
Well, all that tells us
is that Philip died in the park,

08:30.151 --> 08:31.650
which is something
we already knew.

08:31.717 --> 08:34.017
Park manager said they sprayed
for the first time this morning.

08:34.083 --> 08:36.984
So, we find the suspects
with mulch,

08:37.051 --> 08:39.549
we find the mob.

08:39.616 --> 08:42.150
Now all you need
is a few suspects.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.484
I think Calleigh can help
with that.

08:44.550 --> 08:47.251
She just paged me
from Layout. See ya.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.750
So somebody stepped
on Philip's face.

08:50.817 --> 08:53.217
Let's see what kind
of shoes that
somebody had on.

08:53.284 --> 08:55.750
Give me
the class characteristics.

08:55.817 --> 08:58.251
Okay. The majority of the sole
is a chevron pattern.

08:58.317 --> 08:59.518
The treads are
approximately

08:59.583 --> 09:00.784
one centimeter
in width

09:00.850 --> 09:01.884
at two-centimeter
intervals.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.217
And the border

09:03.284 --> 09:04.583
is single-lined continuous.

09:04.650 --> 09:06.084
Let me see.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.583
The latest
Transverse Five Stars.

09:15.017 --> 09:16.917
Lieutenant Caine.
What's the news?

09:16.984 --> 09:19.683
The news is,
you lied to me.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.850
What?

09:20.917 --> 09:22.117
You didn't rush

09:22.184 --> 09:24.017
your daughter home
this morning.

09:24.084 --> 09:26.717
Your shoeprints were found
all over Philip Gordon's face.

09:31.717 --> 09:35.151
Well, what would you do if some
pervert came after your kid?

09:35.217 --> 09:38.284
<i>Why don't you tell me
what you did, Victor?</i>

09:38.351 --> 09:42.117
Look, I was talking
to some of the other dads.

09:42.184 --> 09:44.617
I thought I was keeping an eye
on Isabel the whole time.

09:44.683 --> 09:45.917
Then, all of a sudden,
I hear her crying.

09:49.384 --> 09:50.583
Daddy!

09:50.650 --> 09:51.418
Where are you,

09:51.484 --> 09:52.617
Daddy?!

09:52.683 --> 09:53.984
That's that pervert.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.384
Let's get him.

09:56.650 --> 09:58.284
Get him!
Get him!
Got him!

10:07.017 --> 10:09.317
And then you stabbed
him to protect
your daughter.

10:09.384 --> 10:12.917
Stabbed...?
Hey, I didn't stab anybody.

10:12.984 --> 10:15.418
Look. Like I said,
I chased the guy,

10:15.484 --> 10:17.317
and then I gave him
a good whaling. That's it.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.950
This morning, you told us
you didn't recognize him.

10:20.017 --> 10:21.917
Everybody knew that freak.

10:21.984 --> 10:22.850
From the Website?

10:22.917 --> 10:24.717
No. The posters.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.317
They're all over my street.

10:27.384 --> 10:29.284
Posters.

10:29.351 --> 10:30.784
Excuse me, Frank.

10:30.850 --> 10:35.384
Eric, get Mr. Wolfe, and go back
to that neighborhood.

10:35.451 --> 10:36.850
Thank you.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.550
Hey, check this out.

10:51.617 --> 10:53.650
There were posters here,

10:53.717 --> 10:55.484
now there are just
staples and corners.

10:55.550 --> 10:56.884
Somebody took them all down.

10:56.950 --> 10:59.518
Yeah. Guilty conscience.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.750
Or it's a consciousness
of guilt.

11:01.817 --> 11:04.217
You keep your kids
on a short leash?

11:04.284 --> 11:05.817
I don't have kids.

11:05.884 --> 11:09.550
Oh, I just figured with all the
"dating" you do...

11:09.617 --> 11:11.151
Yeah, well, I'm very careful.

11:11.217 --> 11:13.384
Well, better safe than sorry.

11:13.451 --> 11:16.418
What about you,
you been dating?

11:16.484 --> 11:18.884
Taking a little bit
of a break right now.

11:18.950 --> 11:21.583
<i>( chuckles ):
A break-- that's
what they call it?</i>

11:21.650 --> 11:24.418
Look, why don't you go
to that side of the street,

11:24.484 --> 11:28.884
take a look, and I'll stay
on this side of the street
and take a look.
Yeah, sure.

11:56.418 --> 11:59.084
I got one.

12:15.017 --> 12:17.650
Wow, somebody really
had it out for him.

12:17.717 --> 12:19.384
Yeah.

12:19.451 --> 12:21.251
Let's find out who.

13:03.644 --> 13:05.577
Of course I put them up.

13:05.644 --> 13:07.544
I also went to PTA meetings

13:07.611 --> 13:10.143
and signed up
for Neighborhood Watch.

13:10.210 --> 13:11.444
When did you
post them, Alexx?

13:11.511 --> 13:13.244
It wasn't like
I was targeting Philip.

13:13.310 --> 13:16.944
I look at the F.D.L.E.
website all the time.

13:25.010 --> 13:28.611
<i>When I saw this guy
was only a few blocks away,</i>

13:28.677 --> 13:31.043
<i>I put up a few posters.</i>

13:31.110 --> 13:34.844
Come on, Horatio,
you know the recidivism rate

13:34.911 --> 13:38.611
for sex offenders
is huge.
And there is no known cure.

13:38.677 --> 13:40.043
Exactly.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.043
I just wanted the parents
to be informed

13:42.110 --> 13:44.911
so they could protect
their chil...

13:44.978 --> 13:46.210
Wait a minute.

13:48.344 --> 13:51.844
Can I be charged criminally
with this?
An aggressive attorney

13:51.911 --> 13:54.010
might move for a civil suit.

13:54.077 --> 13:57.377
Horatio, I was protecting
my children.

14:17.344 --> 14:20.544
Oh, my Lord,
there's one on my block.

14:20.611 --> 14:22.377
Are you gonna move?

14:22.444 --> 14:25.344
I'm gonna move my gun safe
into my bedroom.

14:25.410 --> 14:27.077
But you wouldn't put
a poster up.

14:27.143 --> 14:29.744
It's not illegal.

14:29.811 --> 14:32.577
But I mean as
a county employee, right?

14:32.644 --> 14:34.177
Alexx should've known better.

14:34.244 --> 14:35.577
Well,

14:35.644 --> 14:37.244
she has two kids.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.277
<i>And as a county employee,
she has every right.</i>

14:39.344 --> 14:42.244
We have firsthand knowledge of
how dangerous these guys can be.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.577
She also has firsthand knowledge

14:43.644 --> 14:45.444
of how quickly people escalate
to violence.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.010
She should've thought of that.

14:47.077 --> 14:49.310
Would you rather her little girl
end up on her table instead?

14:51.310 --> 14:54.444
I would rather no one end up
on her table.

14:54.511 --> 14:56.377
That's not always an option
in the real world.

14:56.444 --> 14:59.043
I work patrol--
I think I know

14:59.110 --> 15:01.177
a little something
about the real world.

15:01.244 --> 15:02.444
DELKO:
Guys?

15:03.644 --> 15:05.344
Is there going to be
a rumble here?

15:05.410 --> 15:07.077
We were just discussing
the case.

15:07.143 --> 15:09.110
What's up?
Phil Gordon's
residence,

15:09.177 --> 15:10.577
that's what's up--
it turns out

15:10.644 --> 15:12.477
he wasn't the only one
that lives there.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.310
Who would live
with a sex offender?

15:14.377 --> 15:17.077
Someone with the same
last name-- Gordon.

15:17.143 --> 15:18.577
Sounds like family.
Yeah.

15:18.644 --> 15:20.210
I'm on my way over there
with Tripp to check it out.

15:20.277 --> 15:22.777
Take it easy on each
other, all right?

15:35.978 --> 15:38.210
WOMAN:
We were just letting
Philip stay here

15:38.277 --> 15:40.077
while he got back
on his feet.

15:40.143 --> 15:42.344
So, he was your brother?

15:42.410 --> 15:47.377
MAN:
Yeah, nobody else would
give him a break.

15:50.377 --> 15:52.811
You took these posters down?

15:52.878 --> 15:54.277
You bet I did.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.978
They were like neon arrows
to our front door.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.477
Hayley and I were
being harassed.

15:59.544 --> 16:01.811
That rock through the
window was the last straw.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.344
So why let him live here?

16:03.410 --> 16:05.811
'Cause he's my brother.

16:05.878 --> 16:07.677
Couldn't say no.

16:07.744 --> 16:09.677
How'd you feel about that,
Mrs. Gordon?

16:09.744 --> 16:11.310
I understood.

16:11.377 --> 16:13.077
But it hasn't been easy.

16:13.143 --> 16:15.444
I mean, I've been getting
these migraines

16:15.511 --> 16:17.777
ever since he moved in.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.477
Why don't you go
lie down, honey, okay?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.177
<i>( softly ):
Okay.</i>

16:25.911 --> 16:27.344
<i>( sighs )</i>

16:27.410 --> 16:29.277
This has been hard on her.

16:29.344 --> 16:31.277
Since the
vandalism started,

16:31.344 --> 16:32.878
we can't go out anymore.

16:32.944 --> 16:34.477
One of us has
to stay home

16:34.544 --> 16:36.477
at all times
just to protect the house.

16:36.544 --> 16:41.143
So you were home all morning?
I was working;
Hayley was here, sick in bed.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.544
We're gonna need that projectile
that came through the window.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.377
Okay. I threw it in the trash.

16:45.444 --> 16:46.944
All right, well,
then we're gonna need

16:47.010 --> 16:48.210
to confiscate the trash.

16:48.277 --> 16:50.511
It's all yours.
TRIPP:
You want to, uh,

16:50.577 --> 16:51.878
show us Philip's room?

16:51.944 --> 16:54.911
Okay. It's this way.

17:08.844 --> 17:10.444
Is this his?

17:10.511 --> 17:11.844
Yeah.

17:16.944 --> 17:19.176
Lots of death threats.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.511
<i>( groans ):
Smells like ammonia.</i>

17:27.577 --> 17:30.444
Was he using that
to get high?
No, no,

17:30.511 --> 17:31.611
nothing like that.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.110
Philip said he
would inhale those

17:33.177 --> 17:34.777
anytime he had an
unhealthy thought.

17:34.844 --> 17:37.244
Like a reverse Pavlov.

17:46.444 --> 17:48.377
So he was self-correcting?

17:48.444 --> 17:50.744
Yeah. He really wanted
to get better.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.077
Looks like he had
a long way to go.

18:00.143 --> 18:02.010
Yeah.

18:06.277 --> 18:09.210
That kiddie porn on
Philip's computer? Wasn't his.

18:09.277 --> 18:11.210
How could that be?
It's his laptop.

18:11.277 --> 18:13.410
Someone sent him a "pornado."

18:13.477 --> 18:17.277
<i>Philip got an e-mail that said
he won a free trip to Hawaii,</i>

18:17.344 --> 18:19.143
<i>but when he clicked on the link
to collect</i>

18:19.210 --> 18:20.577
<i>his prize,
there was no free tickets,</i>

18:20.644 --> 18:22.010
<i>and there was no hula girls,</i>

18:22.077 --> 18:25.077
<i>there was only porn,
porn and more porn.</i>

18:25.143 --> 18:28.177
<i>Trying to stop it
only makes it worse.</i>

18:31.010 --> 18:32.844
Virtual porn bomb.

18:32.911 --> 18:35.577
I don't get why someone would
send porn to a child molester.

18:35.644 --> 18:37.644
Because somebody wanted him
to look guilty.

18:37.711 --> 18:39.310
Can we find out who?

18:39.377 --> 18:41.077
MDPD's running on the address.

18:41.143 --> 18:43.077
Okay, good. I'm there.

18:43.143 --> 18:46.377
Thanks.

18:54.210 --> 18:57.677
Lieutenant Caine.

18:57.744 --> 18:59.744
We meet again, Ned.

18:59.811 --> 19:01.911
I haven't done anything.

19:01.978 --> 19:03.978
<i>I wouldn't say
you haven't done anything, Ned.</i>

19:04.043 --> 19:06.711
You, uh, sent a virus
to Philip Gordon's computer.

19:06.777 --> 19:08.611
Well, yeah.

19:08.677 --> 19:11.677
And now
Philip Gordon's dead, Ned.

19:11.744 --> 19:14.644
Dead? I-I had nothing
to do with that.

19:14.711 --> 19:16.644
I've been home all day.
Ned,

19:16.711 --> 19:19.711
you wanted Philip gone,
and you got your wish.

19:19.777 --> 19:22.177
Yeah, but I didn't
want him dead.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.244
I just wanted him to move.

19:24.310 --> 19:26.811
I thought if he got caught
with the porn,

19:26.878 --> 19:29.310
it would violate
his terms of release,

19:29.377 --> 19:31.544
and-and-and they'd send him
back to prison.

19:31.611 --> 19:33.377
Why did you care?

19:33.444 --> 19:35.511
Ever since he moved
to the Gables,

19:35.577 --> 19:36.878
I've been getting harassed.

19:36.944 --> 19:39.143
By who?
Neighbors.

19:39.210 --> 19:42.477
It was bad enough you
caught me for peeping
on Ashley Anders.

19:42.544 --> 19:45.077
People hear a guy like that
is moving in,

19:45.143 --> 19:47.143
and-and-and they check out
the Web sites,

19:47.210 --> 19:48.811
and then my picture pops up,

19:48.878 --> 19:51.043
and they think
I'm the same as him.

19:51.110 --> 19:53.177
But you are a
sex offender, Ned.

19:53.244 --> 19:55.110
But I'm not a predator.

19:55.177 --> 19:56.878
And I'm not a pedophile.

19:56.944 --> 19:59.477
I-I would never hurt a child.

19:59.544 --> 20:02.177
I just... like adult actresses.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.644
A little too much.

20:04.711 --> 20:06.544
But you have bigger problems
that that--

20:06.611 --> 20:08.511
distributing child pornography
is a felony, Ned.

20:08.577 --> 20:10.844
It's not like I looked at it.

20:10.911 --> 20:12.043
You don't have to.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.277
This the trash from
the brother's place?

20:18.344 --> 20:22.110
Yep. Delko said the
object that went through
their window's in here.

20:23.811 --> 20:25.644
You gonna help?

20:29.077 --> 20:33.010
So, hey, uh, what
happened between you
and Calleigh? Big fight?

20:33.077 --> 20:36.744
It's not really my place to
discuss Calleigh's business.

20:36.811 --> 20:38.377
It's your business, too.

20:38.444 --> 20:40.110
It's not yours.

20:42.177 --> 20:45.477
You know Calleigh will just
tell me later anyway.
Good.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.177
She'll probably
tell it better.

20:57.777 --> 21:00.410
This looks like it
could do some damage.

21:00.477 --> 21:03.944
There's some writing on it.
What's it say?

21:04.010 --> 21:06.377
"You ruined everything."

21:06.444 --> 21:08.210
That sounds personal.

21:08.277 --> 21:10.644
Yeah, maybe it was Ned,
the porn stalker.

21:10.711 --> 21:12.477
Or one of Philip's victims.

21:12.544 --> 21:15.777
I'll run its DNA.

21:15.844 --> 21:18.344
To run against the old cases?
Yeah, it's worth a try.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.677
See if you can find
anything else here.

21:19.744 --> 21:21.477
Yeah.

21:33.010 --> 21:33.944
Hey, Natalia.

21:34.010 --> 21:35.277
Hey.

21:35.344 --> 21:38.511
So, do you want the good news
or the bad news?

21:38.577 --> 21:40.177
Always the good news.

21:40.244 --> 21:41.811
You're invited
to my party.

21:41.878 --> 21:43.777
Thank you very much.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.344
That's great.

21:45.410 --> 21:46.611
Uh, what about the bad news?

21:46.677 --> 21:48.744
The bad news
is the epis from the rock

21:48.811 --> 21:49.978
don't match
any of Philip Gordon's

21:50.077 --> 21:51.978
molested victims.

21:52.043 --> 21:53.711
Maybe it was Ned.

21:53.777 --> 21:55.210
Mm-mm, amelogenin is XX.

21:55.277 --> 21:57.611
It was a girl
that threw that rock.

22:00.010 --> 22:03.010
Let's look at all of
Philip's previous victims.

22:04.577 --> 22:06.110
Did she check
Hannah Brooks in '91?

22:06.177 --> 22:07.143
Yeah.

22:07.210 --> 22:09.544
Uh,

22:09.611 --> 22:11.811
what about Amanda Clarkston,
'93?

22:11.878 --> 22:13.077
Yes.

22:13.143 --> 22:14.477
Mary Pressman?

22:14.544 --> 22:16.978
Ryan, Valera assured me

22:17.043 --> 22:18.878
that she checked all of
Philip Gordon's victims.

22:22.077 --> 22:23.544
This just doesn't make sense.

22:26.677 --> 22:28.077
Oh, wow.

22:28.143 --> 22:30.410
Now this really
doesn't make sense.

22:30.477 --> 22:33.143
According
to his rap sheet,

22:33.210 --> 22:35.711
Philip went from breaking
and entering

22:35.777 --> 22:37.711
to sexual assault
ten years ago.

22:37.777 --> 22:40.477
Sure. The classic escalation
of a sexual predator.

22:40.544 --> 22:41.611
Yeah, exactly.

22:41.677 --> 22:43.878
Except at the height
of his sex crimes,

22:43.944 --> 22:46.010
he committed one more burglary.

22:46.077 --> 22:47.744
These guys don't go backwards.

22:58.344 --> 23:01.944
Burglary? That was over
ten years ago.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.677
Yeah, it was.

23:03.744 --> 23:08.010
But yesterday, someone
threw one of these rocks

23:08.077 --> 23:09.210
through that
burglar's window.

23:09.277 --> 23:11.277
They're out there
for anyone to take.

23:11.344 --> 23:13.477
DUQUESNE:
Can you tell us about that
night ten years ago?

23:13.544 --> 23:14.677
Where was your daughter?

23:14.744 --> 23:16.544
What does that have
to do with anything?

23:16.611 --> 23:18.043
Philip Gordon wasn't
just a burglar.

23:18.110 --> 23:19.644
He was also
a sexual predator.

23:19.711 --> 23:21.844
More than a burglary happened
that night, didn't it?

23:21.911 --> 23:24.611
You're wrong.

23:24.677 --> 23:27.377
Criminals like Philip Gordon
have a progressiveisorder.

23:27.444 --> 23:29.377
That means they don't revert
from sexual assault

23:29.444 --> 23:30.911
back to nonviolent crime.

23:30.978 --> 23:32.777
There's a first time
for everything.

23:32.844 --> 23:33.811
No, they're right.

23:33.878 --> 23:36.944
Julia, don't say another word.

23:37.010 --> 23:39.477
You wouldn't let me talk
back then,

23:39.544 --> 23:40.944
but you can't stop me now.

23:43.010 --> 23:44.444
What happened?

23:44.511 --> 23:48.143
I woke up,
and he was in my bedroom.

24:00.944 --> 24:02.878
My mother, she wouldn't let me
say anything.

24:02.944 --> 24:05.577
She said that the court case
would be too hard

24:05.644 --> 24:08.177
and that it would follow
me forever.

24:08.244 --> 24:10.043
Well, guess what, Mom.

24:11.377 --> 24:13.110
It did anyway.

24:13.177 --> 24:16.143
I was only trying
to protect you.

24:16.210 --> 24:17.310
But you couldn't.

24:18.611 --> 24:21.010
So you decided to get
your own revenge.

24:21.077 --> 24:23.177
I saw those posters.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.944
I couldn't believe

24:25.010 --> 24:26.811
that he would move
into our neighborhood.

24:26.878 --> 24:29.210
I wanted him to know
that I remembered.

24:39.444 --> 24:42.310
I was still so angry.

24:42.377 --> 24:44.277
I'm afraid you're going
to have to come with us

24:44.344 --> 24:45.711
to the station
and make a statement.

24:55.444 --> 24:56.544
Dr. Halliwell?

24:56.611 --> 24:59.878
Alexx, have a seat.

25:03.577 --> 25:04.711
I understand
you were being questioned

25:04.777 --> 25:06.010
in relation to a murder.

25:06.077 --> 25:09.444
Gary, I put up posters,
that's it.

25:09.511 --> 25:11.577
Hey, I'm on your side, Alexx.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.911
So what's the problem?

25:13.978 --> 25:15.811
I just think
it would be a good thing

25:15.878 --> 25:17.811
for you to take a break
from the day shift,

25:17.878 --> 25:20.344
Lieutenant Caine
and his team.

25:20.410 --> 25:21.978
This won't affect my work.

25:22.043 --> 25:23.577
It already has.

25:23.644 --> 25:26.444
Today you were being questioned
about a murder, Alexx,

25:26.511 --> 25:29.143
and a few months ago
you wrote a prescription
for CSI Wolfe.

25:29.210 --> 25:30.677
Ryan needed antibiotics.

25:30.744 --> 25:32.477
He should've seen his doctor.

25:32.544 --> 25:35.010
I was helping a friend.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.344
They're your friends,
I am your boss.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.611
So you're punishing me.

25:39.677 --> 25:40.911
I'm helping you.

25:42.644 --> 25:45.711
You're an excellent
forensic pathologist, Alexx.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.277
Thank you, Doctor.

25:47.344 --> 25:48.377
As you know,

25:48.444 --> 25:50.377
I make the deputy chief
appointment.

25:50.444 --> 25:53.344
I see no reason
why it shouldn't be you someday.

25:53.410 --> 25:55.010
I'm flattered.

25:55.077 --> 25:58.677
But that appointment is based
on politics as much as merit.

25:58.744 --> 26:00.043
Meaning?

26:00.110 --> 26:02.677
I'm looking out
for your reputation.

26:02.744 --> 26:05.210
I want you to switch
to night shift.

26:05.277 --> 26:07.277
Working with
an unfamiliar crew

26:07.344 --> 26:09.511
will help
keep you objective.

26:12.010 --> 26:14.110
Okay.

26:17.477 --> 26:19.210
Well,

26:19.277 --> 26:21.911
you're making a good decision.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.410
So you think
the young girl did it?

26:37.477 --> 26:39.177
No. There's no
hydromulch

26:39.244 --> 26:40.511
on her clothes
or shoes.

26:40.577 --> 26:43.244
Eh, doesn't mean
she wasn't involved.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.210
Yeah, we're checking
her story.

26:46.277 --> 26:48.110
Walk all the way over
here for this?

26:48.177 --> 26:49.611
You're taking a real
interest in this case.

26:49.677 --> 26:53.344
Yeah. And I also wanted
to make sure

26:53.410 --> 26:55.110
your eye infection
has cleared.

26:55.177 --> 26:57.143
Yeah, it's all good.

26:57.210 --> 26:58.577
My doctor is looking
into nerve damage.

26:58.644 --> 27:00.511
Nerve damage?

27:00.577 --> 27:01.811
I can't help you
anymore.

27:01.878 --> 27:03.277
I have my own
doctor now.

27:03.344 --> 27:07.110
Ryan, who did you tell
I wrote you that prescription?

27:07.177 --> 27:09.110
No one.

27:09.177 --> 27:11.577
Well, the news traveled
all the way

27:11.644 --> 27:13.644
to the chief medical
examiner's office.

27:13.711 --> 27:16.244
Well, Alexx, you know
there's a mole in the lab.

27:16.310 --> 27:19.143
Which is why I can't do
any more favors.

27:19.210 --> 27:21.677
I really put myself out
on a limb for you, baby.

27:21.744 --> 27:23.511
I got it.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.110
I don't know if I can
keep this up, H.

27:34.177 --> 27:36.844
Mr. Wolfe, I understand,
but I need you to trust me.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.574
Did you page me?

27:56.640 --> 27:58.574
Yeah. I went through
the rest of the trash

27:58.640 --> 27:59.941
from Philip's house.

28:00.007 --> 28:02.373
Check this out.

28:02.440 --> 28:05.141
WOLFE:
Yeah, that's hydromulch
from the park.

28:12.707 --> 28:14.841
This is a failed delivery notice
from WorldSend.

28:14.907 --> 28:17.041
Are you telling me
the WorldSend man killed Philip?

28:17.107 --> 28:18.874
No, the wife said she was home
all morning.

28:18.941 --> 28:21.208
But according to this, WorldSend
tried to deliver a notice

28:21.274 --> 28:23.574
at 10:10 and no one was there.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.774
So it blows her alibi.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.208
Yep, sure does.

28:36.373 --> 28:38.907
It must have been hard
to let Philip into your home.

28:38.974 --> 28:41.241
Like Robert said,
he's family.

28:41.308 --> 28:44.674
He's not your family.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.707
I consider him
to be.

28:46.774 --> 28:48.208
Look, what is this about?

28:48.274 --> 28:51.941
You weren't home all day
like you said you were.

28:52.007 --> 28:54.007
WorldSend tried
to deliver a package

28:54.074 --> 28:55.841
and no one was there.

28:55.907 --> 28:58.774
I did go out
for a bit.

28:58.841 --> 29:01.974
I went to the doctor,
since I wasn't feeling well.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.241
Like I told
the detective,

29:03.308 --> 29:04.874
I've been getting
migraines.

29:04.941 --> 29:06.841
We found evidence from the park
on that note.

29:06.907 --> 29:09.807
I walked to the appointment.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.174
I thought fresh air might help.

29:12.241 --> 29:14.107
Look, call my doctor.
He'll tell you.

29:14.174 --> 29:16.041
We will.

29:21.074 --> 29:23.041
Hey, Tripp.
Yeah?

29:23.107 --> 29:24.574
Anything on the wife?

29:24.640 --> 29:26.941
Yeah, her alibi
checks out.

29:27.007 --> 29:29.440
Doctor's office called
and confirmed an appointment.

29:29.507 --> 29:31.274
So why was she
acting so weird?

29:31.340 --> 29:32.941
Probably conflicted;

29:33.007 --> 29:34.274
didn't want to live
with Philip,

29:34.340 --> 29:35.540
but she's married
to his brother.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.574
And people think
you're a tough guy.

29:41.107 --> 29:43.907
I need to see Lieutenant Caine
A.S.A.P.!

29:43.974 --> 29:45.473
What's going on?

29:45.540 --> 29:46.974
Oh, no, no, no.

29:47.041 --> 29:49.473
I will only speak
to Horatio Caine.

29:49.540 --> 29:52.407
Okay, we'll take you to him.

29:52.473 --> 29:54.141
No, this is important!

29:54.208 --> 29:55.807
Someone just tried
to kill me!

29:57.308 --> 29:58.807
Thought I was a child molester.

30:00.308 --> 30:05.241
I know. I know I shouldn't
have done the pornado.

30:05.308 --> 30:08.774
But Lieutenant,
my life's in danger.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.274
Who attacked you, Ned?

30:10.340 --> 30:13.308
I don't know.
I couldn't see his face.

30:13.373 --> 30:16.007
So, tell me exactly
what happened.

30:16.074 --> 30:19.941
I never, never should have
opened the door.

30:22.174 --> 30:24.507
You touch any kid
in this neighborhood...

30:24.574 --> 30:27.574
Please, don't!
I'm not like that!

30:30.974 --> 30:32.974
Can you describe him, Ned?

30:33.041 --> 30:35.874
Male, six feet,

30:35.941 --> 30:38.473
average size.

30:38.540 --> 30:42.274
Hey, when you catch him,
can I sue?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.674
Ned, first I need
to catch him.

30:46.107 --> 30:47.707
Why the camera?

30:47.774 --> 30:49.274
I have to take a photograph
of your bruise.

30:49.340 --> 30:50.807
I don't have a bruise.

30:50.874 --> 30:52.707
Not that you can see.
Can you stand up, please?

30:54.941 --> 30:56.674
Pull your shirt aside.

30:56.740 --> 31:00.841
When you get a bruise, blood
vessels break under your skin.

31:00.907 --> 31:03.640
It can take a few days
for the bruise to visibly form.

31:03.707 --> 31:07.974
UV light penetrates the skin
deeper than visible light,

31:08.041 --> 31:10.774
so this camera can figure out
what's going on underneath.

31:10.841 --> 31:12.507
You can see
under my skin?

31:12.574 --> 31:14.074
I'm about to.

31:18.540 --> 31:22.740
Whoa, you, uh... you planning
on going postal?

31:22.807 --> 31:24.807
I'm planning on catching
the vigilante.

31:24.874 --> 31:26.473
Okay.

31:26.540 --> 31:29.407
I measured that photograph
that Ryan took of Ned's bruise,

31:29.473 --> 31:31.440
and I've determined
that the mark was made

31:31.507 --> 31:33.974
by either a .45
or a nine-millimeter.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.874
Great. Well,
that narrows it down

31:35.941 --> 31:37.407
to half the population
of Miami.

31:37.473 --> 31:39.740
Well, this actually narrows it
down a bit more.

31:39.807 --> 31:42.774
Two Colts and a Smith are the
only models that make

31:42.841 --> 31:44.407
this figure-eight barrel.

31:44.473 --> 31:46.274
So what now?

31:46.340 --> 31:48.574
Play the match game.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.574
This barrel plug ratio
is not proportional.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.241
Muzzle diameter is a few
millimeters short.

31:58.740 --> 32:00.041
We got it.

32:06.407 --> 32:09.208
This is the barrel
that made the impression.

32:09.274 --> 32:11.540
Colt nine-mill, 19-11.

32:11.607 --> 32:13.107
All right. I'm going
to check the computer,

32:13.174 --> 32:15.340
see if anyone in Ned's
neighborhood owns one.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.974
Yeah, got several names.

32:24.041 --> 32:28.607
Michael Cohen, Milo Jenkins,
Keith Gretson, Victor Terraza...

32:28.674 --> 32:29.807
Victor Terraza.

32:30.841 --> 32:33.041
That name keeps popping up.

32:33.107 --> 32:34.540
I'm going to let Horatio know.

32:34.607 --> 32:36.473
This morning,
you left the part out

32:36.540 --> 32:38.540
about your sex-offender
welcome wagon.

32:38.607 --> 32:42.308
I just like to scare
punks like Ned.

32:42.373 --> 32:43.574
CAINE:
Then how can you

32:43.640 --> 32:44.841
explain to me, Victor,

32:44.907 --> 32:47.407
that Philip
ended up dead?

32:47.473 --> 32:49.241
That guy was a threat.

32:49.308 --> 32:50.974
Hanging around that park
every morning?

32:51.041 --> 32:52.607
It was only a matter of time

32:52.674 --> 32:54.274
before he snatched up some
little girl.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.241
You knew Philip
was going to be at the park,

32:56.308 --> 32:57.407
and yet you took Isabel anyway.

32:57.473 --> 32:58.974
I can protect her.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.274
You have

33:00.340 --> 33:03.941
a swing set in your own
backyard, yet you chose

33:04.007 --> 33:06.241
to go to the park.

33:06.308 --> 33:08.074
Isabel likes it.

33:08.141 --> 33:09.607
I don't think
that's what happened, Victor.

33:09.674 --> 33:11.974
I think that you
targeted Philip.

33:12.041 --> 33:13.174
You think a lot of things.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.174
And I also think

33:14.241 --> 33:17.507
that you used Isabel as bait.

33:17.574 --> 33:19.841
All right.

33:19.907 --> 33:21.607
You play here, baby.

33:21.674 --> 33:23.041
Papi has something
he has to do.

33:23.107 --> 33:26.340
If any man comes up to
you, you scream, okay?

33:26.407 --> 33:27.507
Okay, Daddy.

33:27.574 --> 33:29.774
Okay, go ahead.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.074
You dressed her up
and took her to the park,

33:40.141 --> 33:41.674
knowing there was a sexual
predator there.

33:44.774 --> 33:48.707
I still didn't stab the guy,
so... I'm out of here.

33:48.774 --> 33:50.174
Hold up.

33:50.241 --> 33:52.540
Actually...
that's not true.

33:52.607 --> 33:54.340
You're not going anywhere.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.373
Raise your
arms up.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.841
You assaulted Ned Ostroff.

33:56.907 --> 33:58.740
You'll be sticking around
here for a little while.

34:01.674 --> 34:03.707
Well, what do
we have here?

34:10.007 --> 34:11.241
Wow, that's sharp.

34:11.308 --> 34:12.574
You take this
to the park this morning?

34:12.639 --> 34:13.841
No comment.

34:13.907 --> 34:15.873
Arrest him, Frank.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.141
Let's go.

34:21.340 --> 34:24.174
Horatio wants us to compare
the wounds on the victim

34:24.241 --> 34:26.308
to the knife we found
on Victor Terraza.

34:26.373 --> 34:27.739
Double-edge blade.

34:27.806 --> 34:31.007
A knife like this leaves
a clean, symmetrical wound.

34:31.074 --> 34:33.507
Philip's wound was ragged.

34:33.574 --> 34:35.774
Meaning that the murder
weapon would have to be

34:35.841 --> 34:37.208
a single-edge
serrated knife,

34:37.274 --> 34:38.674
so that is not
the murder weapon.

34:38.739 --> 34:39.974
Afraid not.

34:40.041 --> 34:42.107
The only other
bleeder...

34:43.373 --> 34:44.540
...is this.

34:44.607 --> 34:47.340
Look at this
laceration.

34:47.407 --> 34:49.574
I thought he got it
from the fence.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.208
But the edges are curved.

34:51.274 --> 34:53.107
From a serrated knife.

34:56.041 --> 34:57.208
It's not torn.

34:57.274 --> 34:58.807
So?

34:58.874 --> 35:00.473
Philip had a knife wound
on his back.

35:00.540 --> 35:01.707
Well, how'd that happen?

35:11.308 --> 35:13.041
He was carrying the knife
in his belt.

35:13.107 --> 35:15.440
And he got the scratch when
the killer pulled it out.

35:18.674 --> 35:21.241
Which means he brought
the murder weapon with him,

35:21.308 --> 35:24.274
either for protection
or... who knows?

35:24.340 --> 35:26.473
Philip was killed
with his own knife.

35:46.323 --> 35:48.290
HALLIWELL:
What's this about?

35:48.357 --> 35:51.891
Dr. Warner is gonna trade
shifts with me next month.

35:51.957 --> 35:53.490
I'm back on days.

35:53.557 --> 35:55.524
That's my decision,
not yours.

35:55.590 --> 35:59.490
This team treats me like family,

35:59.557 --> 36:03.791
and Horatio Caine is personally
responsible for saving my life.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.091
You don't owe him anything.

36:05.158 --> 36:06.557
Yes, I do.

36:07.824 --> 36:09.724
And I want to work
with people I respect.

36:09.791 --> 36:11.223
Excuse me?

36:11.290 --> 36:12.857
Dr. Halliwell,

36:12.924 --> 36:16.024
Lieutenant Caine and his team
are at the top of their field.

36:16.091 --> 36:17.724
and I want to work
with the best.

36:17.791 --> 36:19.824
Now, if that
blocks my chance

36:19.891 --> 36:23.891
at having a corner office
and a few extra bucks a week,

36:23.957 --> 36:25.223
so be it.

36:25.290 --> 36:27.124
You realize what
you're giving up.

36:28.757 --> 36:30.891
My decision is made.

36:30.957 --> 36:32.891
And now you have
to live with it.

36:45.824 --> 36:47.691
W-What do you want
with my kitchen?

36:47.757 --> 36:49.290
CAINE:
Philip was found
with a knife

36:49.357 --> 36:50.590
on him this
morning, ma'am,

36:50.657 --> 36:52.924
and it may turn out
to be the murder weapon.

36:52.991 --> 36:54.991
HAYLEY:
But all of my
knives are here.

36:55.058 --> 36:56.158
It couldn't be
one of mine.

36:56.223 --> 36:57.424
Unless somebody
put it back.

36:57.490 --> 36:58.991
We'll know as soon
as we find it.

37:06.323 --> 37:07.924
This one tested positive

37:07.991 --> 37:09.624
for blood.
We've got our murder weapon.

37:09.691 --> 37:12.190
So someone in this house

37:12.257 --> 37:13.223
killed Philip.

37:13.290 --> 37:16.290
I did it.

37:16.357 --> 37:17.657
No, you didn't.

37:17.724 --> 37:19.524
You were at the doctor,
just like you said.

37:19.590 --> 37:21.590
No. No, I'm confessing.

37:21.657 --> 37:22.824
Arrest me.

37:22.891 --> 37:24.190
After what you've been through,

37:24.257 --> 37:26.691
I doubt very much you could
have overpowered Philip.

37:28.557 --> 37:31.791
Want to tell me what happened?

37:33.290 --> 37:36.024
We've been trying
to get pregnant

37:36.091 --> 37:37.323
for three years.

37:37.390 --> 37:39.557
All we wanted was

37:39.624 --> 37:41.891
our own family.

37:41.957 --> 37:45.490
And then Philip...

37:45.557 --> 37:47.557
got out of prison.

37:49.757 --> 37:53.590
I... I came home
and I saw the graffiti

37:53.657 --> 37:55.590
and the broken window.

37:55.657 --> 37:58.124
The stress...

38:00.124 --> 38:03.524
I started bleeding, and...

38:03.590 --> 38:05.091
I lost the baby.

38:08.657 --> 38:11.657
So you blamed Philip.

38:13.791 --> 38:17.691
The doctor said there could be
a million reasons why.

38:17.757 --> 38:20.457
I couldn't help
but think that maybe

38:20.524 --> 38:22.223
if he hadn't moved in...

38:22.290 --> 38:25.091
I'd still be pregnant.

38:25.158 --> 38:29.857
And at what point, Hayley,
did you inform Robert?

38:29.924 --> 38:32.924
Robert...

38:32.991 --> 38:36.557
Um...

38:36.624 --> 38:38.957
As soon as it happened.

38:39.024 --> 38:40.190
Thank you, ma'am.

38:47.991 --> 38:51.590
My parents taught us
that family was everything.

38:51.657 --> 38:56.158
I wanted to believe
that Philip could get better.

38:56.223 --> 38:59.891
Yes, because Philip
was your brother, right?

38:59.957 --> 39:02.257
But then Hayley told me
about the miscarriage.

39:02.323 --> 39:04.390
And that's when you
went over the edge.

39:04.457 --> 39:05.724
I was just gonna tell him

39:05.791 --> 39:08.524
that he had to move out.

39:08.590 --> 39:11.190
So you went to look
for him at the park.

39:15.991 --> 39:17.791
What is this?

39:17.857 --> 39:19.223
A knife?

39:19.290 --> 39:22.091
It's nothing. I-I need...
I need protection.

39:22.158 --> 39:24.724
When I saw that knife,

39:24.791 --> 39:27.624
I knew he was never
going to be normal.

39:27.691 --> 39:29.624
Why are you even
at this playground?

39:29.691 --> 39:33.024
You are not supposed to be
within a hundred feet.

39:33.091 --> 39:34.223
I'm just testing myself.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.857
I won't do anything, I promise.

39:35.924 --> 39:37.158
You need to stop.

39:37.223 --> 39:41.524
I-I don't think that I can.

40:08.657 --> 40:12.257
And I thought
I was the good brother.

40:12.323 --> 40:13.490
I stood up for him.

40:13.557 --> 40:16.290
You stood up for him
by killing him.

40:16.357 --> 40:18.657
I had to do it.

40:20.991 --> 40:23.757
He was gonna hurt someone else.

40:23.824 --> 40:27.024
He already hurt my family.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.991
No, you did that.

40:29.058 --> 40:31.524
You hurt your family.

40:31.590 --> 40:34.024
Officer.

41:13.657 --> 41:15.924
I feel bad
for that guy.

41:15.991 --> 41:18.791
I hope the jury
takes it easy on him.

41:18.857 --> 41:20.223
A killer is a killer.

41:20.290 --> 41:22.457
You believe that?

41:24.323 --> 41:27.190
Personally? No.

41:27.257 --> 41:28.290
Professionally, yeah.

41:28.357 --> 41:29.757
And I'm still on the clock.

41:29.824 --> 41:32.290
You want to ask me again
in about an hour over a beer?

41:32.357 --> 41:34.590
Oh, you're not mad at me?

41:34.657 --> 41:37.691
'Cause, um, I heard we got
in a really big fight today.

41:37.757 --> 41:40.791
Don't believe
everything you hear.
