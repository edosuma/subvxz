00:04.421 --> 00:06.423
{\an1}You're not on
the list. Sorry.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.090
Could you check
again, please?

00:08.173 --> 00:11.052
Like it's going
to appear by magic?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.804
Hey, what's the problem?

00:12.887 --> 00:14.097
Hi, I'm Rob Andrews.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.598
I'm supposed to be
meeting people here.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.434
{\an3}He says he's a member
of the Tarantino party.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.936
{\an3}But he's not on
the list, Valerie.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.646
No, look, never mind.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.107
I didn't want to come here
in the first place.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.400
Thanks anyway.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.819
Good night.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.784
Uh, hey, Rob.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.619
{\an3}Listen, if you're supposed
to be meeting Quentin,

00:36.703 --> 00:37.662
I could go ask him.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.997
Thanks, but please don't.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.124
{\an1}This whole thing was
my manager's idea.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.168
{\an1}Let him figure out
why I didn't make it.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.128
{\an5}MAN:
Hey, Rob, over here.
Good night.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.880
(people clamoring)

00:50.383 --> 00:53.094
Um, excuse me, who is that?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.179
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Rob Andrews.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.472
{\an1}VALERIE:
Yeah, I know his name.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.765
{\an1}Who is he?

00:56.848 --> 00:58.349
He's coming out in
some hot new movie.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.977
{\an3}They say he's gonna
be the next James Dean.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.032
Well, I must not have
a mom bone in my body

01:14.115 --> 01:16.326
because I still think you panic.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.329
No, I'm fine.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.790
Great. Have fun.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.666
I love you, too. Bye.

01:34.427 --> 01:35.345
Hey.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.930
Hey.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.731
{\an1}No, it's okay,
you don't have to run away.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.066
Who said I was running away?

01:48.149 --> 01:50.652
Just taking a quick nap?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.403
Yeah.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.863
Where are your parents?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.699
My mom was supposed
to pick me up at the beach.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.535
She never showed.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.704
So you've been here
alone all night?

02:03.665 --> 02:04.707
{\an3}Hey, hey,

02:04.791 --> 02:05.875
where do you live?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.377
I'm not allowed to
talk to strangers.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.713
Me, neither.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.549
My name's Kelly.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.217
What's your name?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.343
Joey.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.887
Are you hungry, Joey?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.722
{\an3}Yeah.
Well, why don't you

02:19.806 --> 02:21.724
come on in, and I'll make you
something to eat.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.686
{\an6}Then you can call
home and tell them
where you are, okay?

02:28.147 --> 02:30.608

02:57.093 --> 02:59.095

04:23.429 --> 04:24.722
What's the matter?

04:24.806 --> 04:26.182
I just, I can't figure out

04:26.265 --> 04:27.809
{\an3}what I'm going to do
about your mother.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.186
We're almost to
San Luis Obispo.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.522
{\an1}Why are you even talking
about my mother?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.691
Because I know she hates me.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.734
I just, I can't figure out
if it's because I'm crazy

04:36.818 --> 04:38.611
or because I'm Jewish.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.446
Why are you doing this
to yourself now?

04:40.530 --> 04:41.864
It bugs me, okay?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.533
And you're not doing
anything to help.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.742
{\an1}Me?
She's your mother.

04:44.826 --> 04:48.413
David, look, even
if she loved you,

04:48.496 --> 04:51.082
she's still gonna think we're
way too young to be so serious.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.337
You're right. I'm sorry.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.047
It's, it's just frustrating.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.925
Well, at least my grandmother's
looking forward to meeting you.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.386
(chuckles)

05:03.469 --> 05:04.929
Yeah, that's because
she's your father's mother.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.222
David.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.182
How come I never
met her before?

05:08.266 --> 05:11.394
I mean she's never come down
for holidays or anything.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.188
Because when she lived in
Seattle, she wouldn't fly.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.441
She, she won't even step foot
on an airplane.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.359
At least now she's
in driving distance.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.694
What about your grandfather?

05:19.777 --> 05:20.903
{\an3}You never talk
about him.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.697
He was a pilot in World War II.

05:22.780 --> 05:23.906
But he didn't make it.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.075
That's probably why
she doesn't fly.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.452
I don't know.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.996
The whole subject is
some big family taboo.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.414
Just don't bring it up, okay?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.416
You don't have to ask me twice.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.876
Believe me,
I need as many allies

05:34.959 --> 05:36.627
in your family as I can get.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.005
(sighs)

05:41.758 --> 05:43.968
Bran, come on, before
breakfast gets cold.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.387
Sorry man, I couldn't get off
the phone with Tracy.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.097
{\an1}I thought things were going
very well with you two.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.599
{\an3}Yeah, they are.
They're fine.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.933
{\an3}It's just, you know, she
thinks we're in a rut.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.602
We do the same thing
every weekend, bro.

05:52.685 --> 05:53.436
That's easy.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.438
Do something different.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.481
Thanks for the
advice, Steve.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.940
Why did you make me breakfast?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.734
Because I care.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.613
You don't care that much.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.489
What do you want?

06:04.572 --> 06:06.657
(nervous chuckle)

06:06.741 --> 06:08.576
Bran, it's Saturday, right?

06:08.659 --> 06:09.619
The TV studio is empty, right?

06:09.702 --> 06:12.580
Do you think I could get
the keys for a little bit?

06:12.663 --> 06:15.124
What for?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.795
I have a marketing project
I need a demo tape for.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.464
I was just thinking it'll take
a few hours, come on.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.592
I can't just hand you the keys
to the TV station.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.260
We'll do it next week.
I'll help you.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.137
Yeah, uh, it's due Monday.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.764
Oh, man.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.933
How-how's the omelet?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.476
(sighs)

06:33.559 --> 06:36.312
Fine. I'll help you,
but we have to be done by 7:00.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.480
I got plans with Tracy.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.107
No problem.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.608
More juice, dear?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.569
(phone ringing)

06:44.570 --> 06:46.364
Hello.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.533
Hi, um, do you remember me?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.326
Yeah, sure, from
the club last night.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.786
How'd you find me?

06:51.869 --> 06:54.997
Well, a little perseverance
and a lot of know-how

06:55.081 --> 06:58.334
and a couple of free passes
to my club for your desk clerk.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.461
Wow. I didn't realize I was
worth that kind of effort.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.340
Well, listen, I just wanted
to apologize for last night.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.967
Why didn't you tell me
who you were?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.301
I did.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.512
Right, you did.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.014
Listen, well, now you have
my personal invitation

07:12.098 --> 07:14.350
to come to the club
any night of the week.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.643
On the house.

07:15.726 --> 07:17.103
Tell you the truth,

07:17.186 --> 07:18.688
I really don't hang out
at clubs here much.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.856
Yeah, well, me either.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.190
You own one.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.359
Well, that's no reason
to hang out there.

07:23.442 --> 07:25.695
Um, listen, um, why don't we
meet tonight?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.155
You know, somewhere else.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.948
I'd really like
to make it up to you.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.826
I'll tell you what,
I've got a better idea.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.203
Have you ever been on a
motion picture dubbing stage?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.246
No.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.497
Neither was I till today.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.416
You know, I'm halfway through
a looping session right now.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.667
Why don't you come over here.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.335
I think you might get
a kick out of it.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.378
Sounds great.

07:42.461 --> 07:45.381
{\an3}I think we're ready for you.
Okay.

07:45.464 --> 07:48.551
Um, uh, it's in Hollywood

07:48.634 --> 07:51.387
on Cahuenga and Willoughby.
I'm on stage six.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.680
Okay, I'll see you soon.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.473
All right, I'll see you later.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.442
Can I have some more?

08:04.525 --> 08:09.197
That's all the cereal we have,
but I could make you some eggs.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.490
Hey, why don't you try
calling your mom again.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.743
Nah, I'm almost 12.
She trusts me.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.953
I'll talk to her later.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.123
Well, from what I know about
moms, they're big on worrying.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.249
She's used to it.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.626
Well, I'm not.

08:21.709 --> 08:26.380
So, why don't you
give it another try?

08:27.381 --> 08:28.257
Hey.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.092
Hi.

08:32.135 --> 08:34.889
Is that a little boy?

08:34.972 --> 08:36.097
{\an3}KELLY: Yeah, that's
a little boy.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.265
Maybe a runaway.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.808
His name is Joey.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.270
{\an3}And I have no idea
what to do with him.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.230
Where'd you find him?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.940
Sleeping on our deck.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.316
Nobody home.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.276
I'll try later.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.195
Okay, great.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.281
{\an3}Um, this is
my roommate Clare.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.116
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.284
Hi.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.827
{\an1}Kel, can I talk
to you for a sec?

08:56.911 --> 08:58.162
Sure. One sec.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.873
Call the police.

09:02.875 --> 09:03.834
Are you going to?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.128
Am I going to what?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.129
Call the cops?

09:07.213 --> 09:10.299
Joey, I don't really know

09:10.383 --> 09:11.842
what else I'm supposed to do.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.094
You can't, you can't!

09:13.177 --> 09:15.054
If you do, you'll get
my mom in trouble.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.639
Please, we've got
it all worked out.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.015
She'll pick me up later.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.101
I can't just let you leave.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.104
Well, why don't you come
to the beach with me, then?

09:23.187 --> 09:24.522
There's supposed to be
great waves today.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.649
Where do you live, exactly?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.276
L.A., like you.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.443
I'd better go.

09:34.573 --> 09:37.868
Okay, I'll go with you.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.621
Your mom's probably out there
looking for you right now.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.164
She could be.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.355
Well...
Mm-hmm.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.398
(doorbell chiming)

10:07.481 --> 10:08.524
Oh, I'll get it.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.318
{\an3}Oh, no, no, no, no,
I'll get it.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.320
It's my granddaughter.
Oh!

10:12.403 --> 10:14.947
(chuckling):
Coming.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.160
Oh, my darling, Donna!

10:19.243 --> 10:20.995
I'm so glad to see you.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.038
Oh, come on in.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.205
{\an3}What are you doing
with a cane?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.665
Oh, it's nothing.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.500
{\an3}My arthritis is acting up
a little, that's all.

10:26.584 --> 10:27.835
Sarah's been helping me.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.503
And you didn't tell us,
Dad doesn't know.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.049
Well, there's lots of things
I don't tell your father.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.884
And even more
that I don't tell your mother.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.721
{\an3}Oh, I see you know
Donna's mother.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.930
Yeah, I do.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.599
I'm David Silver.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.851
Oh, David, I'm so glad
to meet you, finally.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.561
{\an1}Yeah, nice to meet you,
too, Mrs. Martin.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.396
Donna's been saying some
wonderful things about you.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.358
I hope they're all true.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.734
Well, I have my moments.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.277
We all have had
our moments.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.695
(laughs)

10:54.779 --> 10:56.906
Well, now come on,
come in, sit down, sit down.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.907
Tea is ready.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.326
{\an1}And I am teaching
Sarah to bake.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.244

She sure is.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.246

11:04.330 --> 11:07.917
{\an1}David, you know, you remind me
of someone I once knew.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.043
{\an1}I do?
Mm-hmm.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.419
Who, Grandma?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.046
Your grandfather.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.632
Sarah, show them that
photograph, will you,

11:14.715 --> 11:15.966
on the mantle?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.134
You and the Captain, ma'am?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.844
{\an1}Uh-huh.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.933
{\an3}Oh, thanks.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.768
Oh, I remember
this picture.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.937
Wow, look at that.

11:28.020 --> 11:28.938
Grandma, you're right.

11:29.021 --> 11:29.897
I never thought of that.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.774
{\an6}BRANDON:
You think?
Yeah.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.608
I don't know.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.151
{\an1}I say if anybody
looks like anybody,

11:34.235 --> 11:35.277
Donna looks a lot like you.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.154
{\an1}DONNA:
Mm, I always have.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.282
And I can't think of anyone
more beautiful to look like.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.283
(chuckles)

11:41.367 --> 11:42.618
Thank you, my darling.

11:42.701 --> 11:43.953
David, um,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.955
Donna tells me
that she loves you.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.039
Do you love her?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.625
Yeah, I do.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.626
Good.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.961
(oven bell dings)
Ah.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.421
{\an3}Mrs. Martin, the
cookies are ready.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.422
All right, good.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.174
Now, you guys just settle in.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.926
And when I get back,

11:59.009 --> 12:00.469
I've got a story to tell you

12:00.553 --> 12:02.179
about Donna's grandfather
and me.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.558
I hope you like gingersnaps.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.643
{\an3}(laughs)

12:09.895 --> 12:13.107
I thought you said she didn't
like to talk about the past.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.483
Well, I guess
I didn't know

12:14.567 --> 12:17.319
{\an3}as much about my family
as I thought I did.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.904
Hmm.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.828
Wait.

12:25.911 --> 12:26.912
Don't...

12:28.747 --> 12:30.791
ROB (as Cain):
Don't answer yet.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.880
Don't let your father
come between us.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.506
(steady beeping)

12:37.590 --> 12:38.966
You know, I've always loved you.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.569
(steady beeping)

12:58.652 --> 13:00.863
You can answer now.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.365
All right, great.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.408
That's it, Rob.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.534
I think we got it.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.746
{\an3}Um, you have a
guest back here.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.333
Um, can I go back?

13:12.416 --> 13:13.792
{\an6}Yeah, just
walk around.
Okay.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.047
Hi.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.758
{\an3}Valerie, I'm glad
you made it.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.219
Yeah, me, too.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.679
{\an1}This is really interesting,
how they put a movie together.

13:25.763 --> 13:26.972
Uh, yeah.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.351
So, how about some lunch?

13:30.434 --> 13:31.519
Sounds good.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.603
Rob, just hang

13:32.686 --> 13:33.687
for another minute, will you?

13:33.771 --> 13:34.730
I want to make sure
we got it all.

13:34.813 --> 13:35.898
Sure, man.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.816
So, what is this movie?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.528
{\an3}Uh, it's called
<i>Adam's Children.</i>

13:40.611 --> 13:42.321
{\an3}Opens in
about a month.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.739
Yeah, I've read about it.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.075
Supposed to star
this amazing, young actor.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.076
You know him?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.953
I used to.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.621
He was a carpenter,
not an actor.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.414
{\an3}You know, this is
my first film,

13:52.498 --> 13:54.083
but the way everyone
in this town treats me,

13:54.166 --> 13:55.543
you'd think I was
some kind of star.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.545
Well, the paparazzi
seemed to know who you were.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.629
Yeah, exactly.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.214
I've only been
in town a few weeks.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.758
How we doing, Chris?

14:02.841 --> 14:04.593
That's a wrap, Rob.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.594
Thanks a lot.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.596
Sure, man.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.597
So, you hungry?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.724
Yeah.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.399
I met your grandfather

14:18.482 --> 14:21.068
at a USO dance
in Hollywood.

14:21.151 --> 14:25.072
{\an1}It was Saturday night,
December 6, 1941.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.074
(big band jazz music playing)

14:27.157 --> 14:29.159
(people chattering, laughing)

14:37.084 --> 14:39.795
<i>I guess you could</i>
<i>blame it on the times...</i>

14:41.839 --> 14:44.133
<i>or the music or the way</i>

14:44.216 --> 14:46.635
<i>he looked in his uniform.</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:52.057
<i>But I guess it was</i>
<i>love at first sight.</i>

15:02.318 --> 15:06.488
And the next day,
the whole world changed forever.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.327
December 7, 1941.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.536
That-that was Pearl Harbor.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.288
Mm-hmm.

15:14.371 --> 15:17.499
But that night,
we danced until dawn.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.417
(sighs)

15:18.500 --> 15:21.503
And then within a week,
we were married.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.839
You only knew him a week?

15:23.922 --> 15:24.381
Mm-hmm.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.799
Oh, my parents were

15:25.883 --> 15:26.925
terribly concerned.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.845
Of course, in those days,
people did marry younger,

15:29.928 --> 15:32.181
but they thought
we were caught up in a fever.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.724
They did not approve.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.226
Maybe they were right.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.521
But we felt we didn't
have much time left.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.732
Your parents didn't understand

15:41.815 --> 15:43.692
the way you guys felt
about each other, did they?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.237
No.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.199
My daughter in law doesn't
approve of you, does she, David?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.493
{\an3}(sighs)

15:54.286 --> 15:56.288
No, she doesn't.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.890
{\an3}You're sure this is the corner
where your mom meets you?

16:14.973 --> 16:15.891
Yeah.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.101
She's probably not coming.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.645
Let's go back to the beach.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.566
{\an3}Joey, why don't you
tell me your address now?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.734
{\an1}What for?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.070
My mom's not gonna be home.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.071
She's probably at work.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.781
{\an3}Okay. Where
does she work?

16:30.864 --> 16:32.074
I-I don't know.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.242
It's a new place.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.368
I forget.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.872
Okay, let's go.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.124
Where're you taking me?

16:40.207 --> 16:41.250
Not to the police.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.293
No, to the Peach Pit--

16:43.377 --> 16:45.129
where I'm going to
buy you a milk shake

16:45.212 --> 16:46.922
and you're going to start
telling me the truth.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.590
No more stories.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.135
{\an3}Let's go.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.469
You sound like a mom.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.888
Don't tell my mom.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.266
{\an3}So we were working
as carpenters,

16:57.349 --> 16:58.767
{\an3}salvaging this big old
farmhouse outside Bloomington.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.603
{\an3}That's where Indiana
University is.

17:01.687 --> 17:04.606
Then when they started filming,
we picked up work as extras.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.692
I got along with the
director real good,

17:06.775 --> 17:09.111
and he gave me a line.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.363
{\an3}Next thing you know,
the star winds up in rehab,

17:11.446 --> 17:13.115
{\an3}and the director
gives me the lead role.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.907
Well, from what I'm seeing,
it seems like

17:14.992 --> 17:16.535
you've been doing it
your whole life.

17:16.617 --> 17:18.619
All you saw was one kiss.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.788
That's all I needed to see.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.791
So, what are you feeling
when you're kissing like that,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.294
you know, with the cameras
and everything?

17:25.377 --> 17:28.422
Uh, actually, I was
feeling pretty stupid.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.257
{\an3}Really?
Yeah.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.634
The director told me
the best way to go about it was

17:32.718 --> 17:35.471
to hear some music in my head
and just let myself go.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.473
{\an3}So I keep trying
to think of

17:37.556 --> 17:40.476
something romantic, like, uh,
the theme from <i> Romeo and Juliet,</i>

17:40.559 --> 17:42.686
{\an3}but all I kept
hearing was

17:42.770 --> 17:43.395
the theme from <i> Love Boat.</i>

17:43.479 --> 17:45.314
{\an3}Well, it worked.
Yeah, well,

17:45.397 --> 17:47.441
Janette was really nice
to work with.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.154
You know, they say that
amateurs can only do it once,

17:52.237 --> 17:55.657
and professionals can do it
over and over again.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.382
You're good.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.675
You're aggressive.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.844
Well, I'm just acting.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.970
Yeah.

all right?

18:39.743 --> 18:41.036

thank you.

of the story now?

21:32.874 --> 21:34.209
Bran, what do we do now?

21:34.292 --> 21:35.377
I don't know, Steve.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.378
This is your infomercial.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.921
You do have a script, don't you?

21:38.005 --> 21:39.464
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I just wrote one.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.424
(chuckles)

21:40.507 --> 21:43.218
{\an1}Sandershine, huh?
Sandershine.

21:43.301 --> 21:45.053
{\an1}Sandershine is
a remarkable result

21:45.137 --> 21:48.015
of a new discovery in wood
maintenance and restoration.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.725
Available only through
our limited time offer,

21:49.808 --> 21:51.059
Sandershine is a product

21:51.143 --> 21:53.562
of an advanced carnauba formula

21:53.645 --> 21:56.565
exclusively available
through our toll-free number.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.566
(laughs)

21:57.649 --> 21:58.734
What do you think?

21:58.817 --> 22:01.111
{\an3}I'll go get the
camera ready.

22:01.194 --> 22:03.905
Bran, what do you think?

22:03.989 --> 22:05.574
Brilliant, Steve.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.868
Absolutely brilliant.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.454
See?

22:10.537 --> 22:12.080
{\an1}I told you
I'm gonna ace this class.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.208
{\an3}And now,
an actor prepares.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.712
So, you think he's gonna fail?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.255
Miserably.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.093
(slurping)

22:25.177 --> 22:27.137
How's your shake?

22:27.220 --> 22:27.971
Good.

22:28.055 --> 22:28.930
You want another one?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.015
Yeah.

22:30.098 --> 22:34.061
Okay, just as soon as you
tell me why you ran away.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.730
{\an3}I told you
I didn't run away.

22:36.813 --> 22:37.773
See, this is the part

22:37.856 --> 22:39.691
{\an1}where you start
telling me the truth.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.906
Okay, but you promise
not to tell the cops.

22:45.989 --> 22:46.948
Promise.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.200
{\an3}Okay,

22:48.283 --> 22:50.410
I did run away,
and I'm never going back.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.953
Why?

22:52.037 --> 22:54.122
Was somebody hurting you?

22:54.206 --> 22:55.290
No way.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.584
I'm born to surf.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.960
Life's a beach, right?

22:59.044 --> 23:02.422
{\an3}Uh, could I have a quarter
for the jukebox?

23:02.506 --> 23:03.799
Sure.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.300
But we're not done talking.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.176
I know.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.972
Oops, sorry.

23:11.056 --> 23:13.058
{\an1}Uh, little young for you,
don't you think, Kel?

23:17.854 --> 23:18.939
Friend of yours?

23:19.022 --> 23:21.149
Uh, hardly. She's
the kind of woman

23:21.233 --> 23:22.818
{\an3}you gotta watch out
for in this town.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.820
Oh, what kind is that?

23:24.903 --> 23:28.156
{\an3}Mm, blonde, sweet smile,
fangs well-hidden.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.032
{\an1}NAT:
Hi, Val.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.284
{\an3}Hey, Nat, I want you
to meet somebody.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.286
{\an3}This is Rob Andrews
and this is Nat Bussichio.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.496
{\an3}Nice to meet you.
Hi.

23:34.579 --> 23:35.997
{\an3}He's got a big movie
coming out soon.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.499
Really? Good luck, pal.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.501
{\an6}Thanks.
Listen, can we get
a couple of coffees?

23:39.584 --> 23:41.044
{\an1}Sure. You got it.
Great. Thanks.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.005
We'll sit here and then I'll
show you the club afterwards.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.633
{\an3}Okay, let's look
at that book.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.385
{\an1}Right.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.678
{\an3}All right.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.179
{\an1}I'm really getting tired
of that hotel.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.056
{\an1}Well, we'll find you
something.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.349
Where's Toluca Lake?

23:54.432 --> 23:56.518
Uh, not for a single guy.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.145
{\an3}You should be
in the canyons.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.187
And why is that?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.565
Well, uh, greenery,

24:01.648 --> 24:04.526
that country-funky feel and
you're still close to town.

24:04.609 --> 24:05.735
You could have a house.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.028
With a garage?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.823
You could have a two-car
garage if you wanted to.

24:09.906 --> 24:14.035
{\an1}It's not for my car.
It's for my tools.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.996
And I'd love to get a porch.

24:16.079 --> 24:16.663
Watch the sun go down.

24:16.746 --> 24:18.707
Well, I'd like nothing more

24:18.790 --> 24:21.126
than to help you find
your first L.A. home.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.137
{\an1}Look at this.
Wait. Come here.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.183
{\an1}It's a picture of my
grandfather and his crew.

24:36.266 --> 24:40.228
(both chuckle)

24:40.312 --> 24:44.524
Oh. And look here.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.944
{\an1}Here's a picture
of my dad as a baby.

24:48.987 --> 24:49.738
It's in this letter

24:49.821 --> 24:54.409
that my grandmother
sent my grandfather.

24:54.492 --> 24:56.286
"My darling John,

24:56.369 --> 25:01.416
"The war brought us together
and the war keeps us apart.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.252
<i>"Everyone is being so kind.</i>

25:04.336 --> 25:07.756
<i>"Your parents and my parents</i>
<i>are all taking care of us.</i>

25:07.839 --> 25:11.092
<i>"Your son is beautiful</i>
<i>and happy.</i>

25:11.176 --> 25:13.595
<i>"Together we wait</i>
<i>for your return.</i>

25:13.678 --> 25:16.765
<i>All of our love flies</i>
<i>with you."</i>

25:33.865 --> 25:36.409
(airplane roars overhead,
men shouting indistinctly)

25:40.497 --> 25:42.290
{\an4}MAN:
All right,
let's go, flyboys!

25:42.374 --> 25:44.292
{\an1}There's a briefing
in five minutes.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.418
{\an1}On the double.
Let's go!

25:45.502 --> 25:47.170
{\an1}MAN 2:
Yes, sir.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.470
{\an4}MAN 3:
Let's go! You're going to be
late! Gotta make the briefing.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.765
(plane engines idling)

26:10.568 --> 26:13.321
{\an1}They sure had
to grow up fast.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.115
{\an3}Yeah.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.618
What's that?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.495
{\an3}Uh, it's a letter from
your grandfather's copilot.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.414
Oh, will you read it?

26:25.709 --> 26:29.671
(clears throat)
"Dear Mrs. Martin,

26:29.754 --> 26:32.173
"It is with great sadness
that I write to you

26:32.257 --> 26:34.843
"of the incidents
of April 4, 1943.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.012
"I feel compelled to tell you,

26:37.095 --> 26:39.681
"for without the courage
and final sacrifice

26:39.764 --> 26:40.890
"of Captain John Martin,

26:40.974 --> 26:44.352
"neither myself nor any of the
crew would be alive today.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.022
"Although it can be
of little solace to you now,

26:47.105 --> 26:48.189
your husband died a hero."

26:50.942 --> 26:52.027
You want me to stop?

26:52.110 --> 26:56.489
No, I want to hear it.

27:02.787 --> 27:03.663
"We were over Antwerp,

27:03.747 --> 27:06.624
"and a burst of flack shattered
our cockpit,

27:06.708 --> 27:09.419
"severely wounding John and me
and crippling the plane.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.047
"But he flew us back to England.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.716
"When they pulled us
from the plane, John was dead.

27:14.799 --> 27:18.428
"I still do not know to this day
how he did it.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.514
"I only know they found your
cross held tightly in his fist.

27:23.433 --> 27:27.145
Yours in eternal respect,
Lieutenant Ralph Hurzack."

27:52.170 --> 27:54.422
(water running)

27:54.506 --> 27:56.925
Are you okay in there?

27:57.008 --> 27:58.218
You need anything?

27:58.301 --> 27:59.761
{\an3}JOEY:
I'm okay.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.262
Great shower.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.264
Take your time.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.810
Don't forget
to wash behind your ears.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.637
{\an5}BRANDON:
All right, Steve, Clare,
let's try one for real.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.932
You're on in three, two...

28:46.015 --> 28:47.934
STEVE:
Ah! (laughs) Hello!

28:48.017 --> 28:50.520
I'm Steve Sanders.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.440
You know,
as a successful student,

28:53.523 --> 28:56.776
I realize the importance of
proper study tool maintenance.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.321
And nothing is more important
than that bedrock of learning--

29:00.405 --> 29:01.865
your desk.

29:01.948 --> 29:05.660
Now, if your desk is made
out of wood, metal,

29:05.743 --> 29:06.828
or some space-age plastic,

29:06.911 --> 29:08.830
it doesn't matter.

29:08.913 --> 29:12.000
{\an1}If it gets dirty, your papers
will get dirty, too.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.169
{\an1}Clarette?

29:14.252 --> 29:15.670
{\an3}That's not the way
we rehearsed it.

29:15.753 --> 29:18.006
{\an1}Just go with it.
I'm on a roll.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.007
{\an1}Clarette?

29:19.090 --> 29:21.009
<i>Oui, monsieur?</i>

29:21.092 --> 29:22.719
{\an1}Ooh, I love
when you speak French.

29:22.802 --> 29:23.803
Nice touch.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.472
{\an1}Oh, God.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.474
Now Clarette has prepared
some desk mess for us.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.851
Does that look familiar?

29:29.934 --> 29:31.352
How many times
have you tried

29:31.436 --> 29:32.562
to hand in one of those?

29:32.645 --> 29:36.483
That's why I invented
Sandershine.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.651
I wanted something fast,

29:38.735 --> 29:40.862
and I wanted something easy.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.531
{\an3}That's it.
Out of here.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.782
Okay, okay, okay, I'll give you
a different reading.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.367
{\an1}We can cut that out,
right, Bran?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.870
Yep.
STEVE: Okay, ready?

29:48.953 --> 29:51.414
{\an1}Now let's see
how Sandershine works.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.917
I tried to tell you.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.168
Oh, it's not so bad.

29:55.251 --> 29:57.378
{\an5}We'll be out
of here soon.
I hope so.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.547
{\an3}I don't want to be in the
Sanderzone all night.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.216
It's not so bad.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.425
Usually I'm out there on camera.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.385
I never get to be in here
with you.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.096
It's kind of cozy.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.389
{\an5}CLARE:
It takes just a matter
of minutes...

30:08.473 --> 30:10.058
Mm-hmm.

30:10.141 --> 30:13.895
{\an5}STEVE:
Now let's see Sandershine
at work, all right?

30:16.105 --> 30:18.024
{\an1}Very good.
Isn't she lovely, folks?

30:18.107 --> 30:19.526
Hmm.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.320
(grunting):
Okay.

30:22.403 --> 30:25.031
(Steve chuckling)

30:25.114 --> 30:26.407
(grunting with exertion)

30:26.491 --> 30:28.576
Uh, Mr. Sanders,

30:28.660 --> 30:30.411
I think we have a problem.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.412
Hmm. What's the matter?

30:31.496 --> 30:32.580
Cleaning too fast, Clarette?

30:32.664 --> 30:35.416
{\an5}(chuckles)
I don't think this
is furniture polish.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.710
{\an1}Of course not.
It's Sandershine!

30:37.794 --> 30:38.545
{\an1}(laughs)

30:38.628 --> 30:41.923
Steve, the rag is stuck
to the desk.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.259
{\an3}My hand is stuck
to the rag.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.094
{\an1}Cut. Cut.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.637
Clare, what happened?
You ruined the take!

30:47.720 --> 30:49.305
{\an3}I'm stuck!

30:49.389 --> 30:50.890
I don't get it, okay?

30:50.974 --> 30:52.225
{\an3}This is cleaner,
not adhesive.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.226
Yeah, it is cleaner.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.978
I just added some stuff
from the janitor closet

30:55.061 --> 30:56.729
so it would look good
from the camera.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.439
What do you mean
you added stuff?

30:58.523 --> 30:59.440
What did you add?

30:59.524 --> 31:01.109
Just some stuff.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.694
Prop people do it all the time.

31:02.777 --> 31:06.447
Steve, you made glue!

31:06.531 --> 31:07.907
Cut.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.909
STEVE:
Cut. Cut.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.786
Brandon,
the red light's still on. Cut.

31:11.869 --> 31:13.162
{\an3}CLARE:
What a joke.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.581
{\an3}Cut...
What the...

31:14.664 --> 31:17.584
Hello, mission control,
we have a problem.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.835
(groans)

31:18.918 --> 31:20.962

crickets chirping)

31:38.271 --> 31:39.480
<i>"Dear Celia.</i>

31:39.564 --> 31:43.776

33:07.652 --> 33:10.780
So, uh, maybe tomorrow
we can hit the surf.

33:10.863 --> 33:13.032
{\an1}I'm not so sure
about that.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.243
{\an3}Why, have you got
a date or something?

33:15.326 --> 33:17.537
{\an3}No.
I'll be quiet.

33:17.620 --> 33:19.414
{\an3}You won't even notice
me tagging along.

33:19.497 --> 33:23.042
I don't have a date or anything,
believe me.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.460
But you must have a boyfriend.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.463
A husband?

33:27.547 --> 33:29.090
Nope.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.051
{\an3}But you're so
pretty, and nice.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.053
Don't you want to have kids?

33:34.137 --> 33:36.931
{\an1}Get back to me
in a couple years on that one.

33:37.014 --> 33:39.350
{\an3}That's right,
because you have me.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.603
Joey, you can't stay here.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.772
I can't take care of you.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.107
Yes, you can.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.984
{\an3}Kelly, you'd make
a great mom.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.236
I-I'd be real good.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.321
(knock at door)

34:01.372 --> 34:03.291
Hi. Are you Kelly Taylor?

34:03.374 --> 34:04.709
Yes.

34:04.792 --> 34:05.793
I'm Chuck Grant.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.128
I'm from L.A. County
Social Services.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.755
This is Officer Surjik.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.966
Sorry we're so late--
we had an emergency.

34:12.049 --> 34:13.842
He's eating right now.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.844
I feel really bad about this.
Yeah.

34:15.928 --> 34:19.014
Let me assure you, though,
you did the right thing.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.683
{\an3}Hundreds of kids
just like him

34:20.766 --> 34:22.435
{\an3}find their way
here every month.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.270
I'm sure he's just confused.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.730
{\an3}We'll find
his parents.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.940
In the majority
of these cases,

34:28.024 --> 34:29.609
everything turns out just fine.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.360
I hope so.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.447
Come on in.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.492
Joey...

34:37.574 --> 34:41.120
{\an1}this is Mr. Grant
and Officer Surjik.

34:41.204 --> 34:42.288
{\an1}They're from
County Social Services.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.371
Hi, Joey.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.458
{\an1}They're gonna help you
find your parents.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.293
{\an1}What?!
I didn't know

34:48.377 --> 34:49.712
what else to do, Joey.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.172
You liar!

34:51.255 --> 34:52.672
You're a liar!

34:52.757 --> 34:54.509
{\an1}KELLY:
Joey...

34:54.592 --> 34:55.802
{\an3}You're not
my friend!

34:55.885 --> 34:56.969
Yes, I am.

34:57.053 --> 34:57.720
I could've stayed here.

34:57.804 --> 34:58.971
I would've been good.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.848
You'll see--
this is for the best.

35:00.932 --> 35:01.849
No, it's not.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.017
I hate you.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.685
I hate you!

35:04.769 --> 35:05.853
{\an3}GRANT:
Joey,

35:05.937 --> 35:07.980
I'm gonna take care of you.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.983
{\an1}It's gonna be all right,
okay?

35:11.067 --> 35:13.528
{\an1}Come on let's go.
Come on.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.677
Watch this.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.220
{\an5}STEVE:
You've been waiting
years for it,

35:39.303 --> 35:41.222
and now, now it's here!

35:41.305 --> 35:43.224
You know how disappointing
conventional glue can be.

35:43.307 --> 35:47.228
When you need something to
stick,<i> really</i> stick, you need...

35:47.311 --> 35:49.355
(imitates fanfare):
♪ Nyah, ha-ha-ha! ♪

35:49.438 --> 35:50.731
Sanderstick!

35:50.815 --> 35:51.983
Available for the first time

35:52.066 --> 35:53.860
through this special
television offer.

35:53.943 --> 35:54.777
It's the amazing
new Sanderstick.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.530
It takes a licking
and keeps on sticking.

35:57.613 --> 35:59.282
(crazed laughter)

36:00.658 --> 36:02.410
Is that Sanderstick
or Sanderschtick?

36:02.493 --> 36:03.870
Dude, this is really bad.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.746
Give it a chance, will you?

36:05.830 --> 36:07.456
Repairs leather, glue,
glass, china,

36:07.540 --> 36:09.250
plastic, wood, even human flesh.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.585
Flesh, even!

36:10.668 --> 36:12.086
Sanderstick sticks
to everything,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.922
and it sticks
and sticks and...<i> sticks.</i>

36:15.006 --> 36:16.549
Yeah, until you add hot water.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.466
Nothing else will do,
you'll need the new glue,

36:17.550 --> 36:18.926
the one that does the trick,

36:19.010 --> 36:21.012
the amazing new Sanderstick.

36:23.681 --> 36:25.558
What do you think? Huh?

36:25.641 --> 36:27.310
{\an3}Uh, C.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.603
Maybe a C-minus.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.354
Those are passing grades;
I'll take those.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.439
What do you think, baby?

36:31.522 --> 36:33.900
Uh, I'd give you an A.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.735
For effort. Come on.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.612
Let's go celebrate.
Cool. Bye.

36:39.488 --> 36:40.740
Well...

36:40.823 --> 36:43.117
here we are, Sunday afternoon,
I'm all yours.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.619
What do you want to do?

36:44.702 --> 36:45.995
(door closes)

36:46.078 --> 36:48.331
{\an3}Well, there <i> is</i>
something I want to do,

36:48.414 --> 36:50.458
{\an3}but I don't know if
you'd be into it.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.336
{\an3}It's... kind of
my fantasy.

36:53.419 --> 36:54.754
A fantasy?

36:54.837 --> 36:56.464
What is it?

36:56.547 --> 37:00.301
Why don't we just...
swing by the TV station?

37:00.384 --> 37:02.261
The TV station?
What's at the TV station?

37:02.345 --> 37:04.138
We could finish off
what we started yesterday

37:04.221 --> 37:05.765
in the control booth.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.975
Finished what
we started yesterday.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.977
We're coming back in three, two,

37:10.061 --> 37:11.938
{\an3}one.
(laughs)

37:14.941 --> 37:16.984
(sighs):
Well...

37:17.068 --> 37:19.153
it needs a lot of work.

37:19.236 --> 37:20.613
Yeah.

37:20.696 --> 37:22.531
{\an3}It's okay--
I like to work.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.784
{\an1}Well, we can find
something else.

37:24.867 --> 37:26.494
Nah, this is perfect.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.371
This place'll
keep me busy.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.374
{\an4}(laughs):
Well, that doesn't
sound like much fun.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.793
{\an3}Why don't we go back
up to that store

37:33.876 --> 37:35.503
and, uh, get a
bottle of wine

37:35.586 --> 37:37.463
{\an3}and drink a toast
to my new digs.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.674
{\an1}Well, that sounds great,
but I thought you had

37:39.757 --> 37:41.842
{\an1}a meeting with
your manager at 6:00.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.719
{\an3}Ah, that's nothing.
I'll cancel.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.305
{\an3}Let's sit.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.307
{\an3}(sighs):
He wants to drag me

37:48.391 --> 37:50.184
to some restaurant
so we can schmooze tonight.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.185
I hate schmoozing.

37:51.268 --> 37:54.689
{\an1}Well, I still think you
should go to the meeting.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.692
You're not gonna be a good
influence on me, are you?

37:57.775 --> 38:00.403
Well, that depends
on what you consider good.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.364
Valerie?

38:03.447 --> 38:06.367
What is it?

38:06.450 --> 38:09.328
{\an3}It's been tough
on me being here.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.372
It's not my kind of place.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.083
{\an3}It's not my
kind of people.

38:15.584 --> 38:18.587
{\an3}Everybody seems to want
something from me.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.135
{\an3}I really could use
someone I can trust.

38:25.302 --> 38:27.430
You can trust me.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.117
(doorbell chimes)

38:48.200 --> 38:50.119
{\an5}(door opens)
DONNA:
<i>Good morning, Grandma.</i>

38:50.202 --> 38:51.245
{\an1}Ah, hello,
my darlings.

38:51.328 --> 38:52.371
I'm so glad you're here.

38:52.455 --> 38:56.250
{\an3}Just, uh, just put the things
over there on the table.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.587
{\an3}Well...

38:59.670 --> 39:02.089
did you, uh...

39:02.173 --> 39:04.258
{\an5}well, did you read the letters?
DONNA:
Yes.

39:04.341 --> 39:05.176
They were so beautiful.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.428
I just can't imagine
the way things were.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.221
You went through
so much so young.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.681
Well, times change.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.100
But love doesn't;
it's always unpredictable.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.977
{\an3}(chuckles):
It seldom,

39:15.061 --> 39:17.938
uh, obeys our expectations.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.066
Or our parents' expectations.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.777
That's why you told us
this story, isn't it?

39:22.860 --> 39:23.944
{\an3}(chuckles):
Yes,

39:24.028 --> 39:27.490
it is-- but if you tell Felice,
I'll have to deny it.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.242
I'm so glad you told us.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.952
{\an3}So am I.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.081
You know, people
have felt sorry for me

39:35.164 --> 39:37.625
because I... I was alone,

39:37.708 --> 39:39.960
{\an3}but I've never
felt sorry.

39:40.044 --> 39:44.298
John left me a love that
has sustained me a lifetime.

39:44.381 --> 39:47.343
Not one day goes by that
I don't think about him.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.136
And, darling,

39:49.220 --> 39:50.930
that cross you wear,

39:51.013 --> 39:54.642
{\an3}that was your
grandfather's cross.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.978
This cross that you gave me

39:58.062 --> 40:00.856
{\an3}for my confirmation?
Yes.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.984
{\an3}Mom never told me.
(chuckles)

40:04.068 --> 40:05.402
She didn't know.

40:06.987 --> 40:09.115
{\an3}I hope it gives you
the same courage.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.033
It already has.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.162
Thanks for everything,
Mrs. Martin.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.705
{\an3}Oh, well, are-are
you sure you,

40:16.789 --> 40:18.874
uh, don't want to stay
for some tea?

40:18.958 --> 40:20.376
No, we have to get going.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.795
Thanks, Grandma, this
has been such an amazing trip.

40:22.878 --> 40:25.339
{\an1}Oh, my darling,
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.969
Bye-bye, my dear.
Oh... take care.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.887
Do come again soon,
now, won't you?

40:31.971 --> 40:33.806
{\an1}Thank you.
Ah, David.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.808
{\an1}Nice to meet you.
Bye.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.184
Bye-bye, my darling.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.352
(sighs)

40:38.435 --> 40:40.146
{\an3}You know, when
I got this cross,

40:40.229 --> 40:43.190
{\an3}I thought it was a reminder
to be a good girl,

40:43.274 --> 40:46.485
{\an3}respect my parents,
do all the right things.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.486
(sighs)

40:47.570 --> 40:49.697
And now?

40:49.780 --> 40:51.615
{\an1}And now...

40:51.699 --> 40:53.868
{\an1}maybe I realize
that it's up to me

40:53.951 --> 40:56.203
{\an1}to decide what those
right things are.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.581
That's what she
was telling me.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.792
Loud and clear.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.379
I love you.

41:05.462 --> 41:08.257
I love you, too.

41:14.972 --> 41:16.182
Good-bye, darling.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.017
Bye, Grandma.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.226
(knock at door)

41:19.310 --> 41:20.477
(seagulls calling)

41:20.561 --> 41:23.189
{\an5}(door opens)
<i>Hello, Miss Taylor.</i>
<i>Chuck Grant.</i>

41:23.272 --> 41:25.274
<i>We met last night.</i>

41:25.357 --> 41:26.525
{\an3}Come on in.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.903
Is everything okay?
We were wondering

41:28.986 --> 41:31.405
{\an3}if you could help us out
with some more information.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.573
Sure.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.783
Anything on any
of Joey's family?

41:34.867 --> 41:37.244
{\an3}Names? People in L.A.
he might contact?

41:37.328 --> 41:39.580
I told you,
I think he's from Phoenix.

41:39.663 --> 41:40.706
We checked Phoenix.

41:40.789 --> 41:42.750
There are no boys missing
who fit his description.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.084
Oh, that's strange.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.753
What about the bus ticket?

41:45.836 --> 41:47.129
{\an3}Might've been
changing buses.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.048
Did he say why he chose L.A.?

41:49.131 --> 41:51.759
He likes to think he's a surfer.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.427
{\an4}(laughs):
He wouldn't talk
to you at all?

41:53.510 --> 41:56.263
We, uh, really never had the
chance to get into it with him.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.806
Why not?

41:57.890 --> 42:01.268
Kelly, Joey ran away
from the shelter this morning.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.978
What?

42:03.062 --> 42:07.983
How could you let that happen?

42:08.067 --> 42:09.610
It's not a jail.

42:09.693 --> 42:10.778
He just slipped away.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.613
Believe me,
we all feel terrible.

42:12.696 --> 42:13.948
You should!

42:14.031 --> 42:16.784
{\an3}He could be in trouble now.
I know.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.786
But we think there's a chance
he might come back here.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.412
Why is that?

42:20.496 --> 42:21.622
He trusts you.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.457
He did until
I turned him in to you.

42:23.540 --> 42:24.833
Now he's got nowhere to go.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.254
I can't believe this.

42:28.337 --> 42:30.756
He probably
would have been better off

42:30.839 --> 42:31.840
if I just let him stay here.

42:31.924 --> 42:33.008
{\an3}I'm sorry.

42:33.092 --> 42:36.762
Just call us if he tries
to contact you or comes back,

42:36.845 --> 42:38.722
{\an3}and I'll do
the same for you.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.724
Please?

42:41.725 --> 42:43.644
Fine.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.313
{\an3}Look, I know how
you must feel,

42:46.397 --> 42:48.107
but you did the right thing.

42:51.568 --> 42:52.987
Fine.
