WEBVTT

00:12.600 --> 00:14.000
I'm Fred Sirieix.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.800
I've worked in
the restaurant industry
for 25 years.

00:16.840 --> 00:21.200
Right now, the UK's restaurant
scene is the envy of the world.

00:21.240 --> 00:25.920
And all it takes is
one great idea to make
a fortune on the high street.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.920
But has the next generation
of restaurants

00:29.960 --> 00:33.280
got what it takes to become
a multi-million pound business?

00:34.080 --> 00:35.520
Over the next six weeks,

00:35.560 --> 00:38.840
here in Manchester,
the food capital of the North,

00:38.880 --> 00:41.640
twelve of the most exciting
new restaurant ideas

00:41.680 --> 00:44.480
are in with a chance
of a life-changing investment

00:44.520 --> 00:47.120
from some of the UK's
most respected investors.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.600
These are the men and women

00:49.640 --> 00:52.840
who can turn an idea
into a national brand.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.680
[Darrel]
We're looking at putting
a lot of money

00:54.720 --> 00:56.840
into the absolute
best concepts.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.240
This is the kind of model
that you dream of.

00:59.280 --> 01:02.960
If I find the right operator,
I'll be fighting for it.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.960
[Fred] Each week,
the investors will give

01:07.000 --> 01:09.560
the people behind
two great new food ideas

01:09.600 --> 01:10.960
a unique opportunity.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.240
Ah, this is brilliant.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.960
[Fred] Their own
pop-up restaurant.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.920
-[dings]
-[man] Right.
Rock and roll, man.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.040
[Fred] They'll have just
three days to prove...

01:18.080 --> 01:20.280
Nobody seems to know
the table numbers.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.440
[Fred]
...they've got what it takes...

01:21.480 --> 01:22.760
That's a disaster.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.040
[Fred]
...to make it
on the high street.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.680
When you start to rush,
that's when you start

01:25.720 --> 01:27.680
-to make more mistakes.
-[clattering]

01:27.720 --> 01:30.040
There's a big backlog
of customers at the door.
What are you gonna do about it?

01:30.080 --> 01:34.840
If I was to invest, it'll take
half a million to £750,000.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.040
Time to make some dough.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.880
[Fred] After the three days,

01:38.920 --> 01:41.480
will the investors
walk back
into the restaurants...

01:41.520 --> 01:42.640
[deep sigh]

01:42.680 --> 01:44.560
[Fred]
...and make them and offer?

01:44.600 --> 01:46.560
It's a £600,000 lunch.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.200
We are not gonna leave
without an investment.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.400
I'm sorry. The time is up.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.080
The doors are
open for business.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.800
Welcome to Million Pound Menu.

02:03.360 --> 02:06.280
[Fred]
Every year, we spend
over thirty-three billion pound

02:06.320 --> 02:08.480
in the UK, eating out.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.120
No wonder the investors are
looking for the next big thing.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.360
A new idea could
make them a fortune.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.760
[narrator] Times might be
challenging on the high street,

02:15.800 --> 02:18.640
but chains based on
strong, simple concepts

02:18.680 --> 02:20.960
are still making money
in towns and cities

02:21.000 --> 02:22.960
across the UK.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.440
So what is the next big idea
to get us queuing for a table?

02:26.480 --> 02:30.080
Well, we might be
about to find out.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.680
Hi, I'm Paul Mason,
I'm the founder
of the Fruit Tailor.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.360
[narrator] The men and women
behind some of the most
successful businesses

02:35.400 --> 02:37.120
on the high street...

02:37.160 --> 02:39.960
At the end of day,
what you do get is a truly
delicious cheese toasty.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.280
[narrator]
...have met to hear ideas
from the next generation

02:42.320 --> 02:44.120
of restaurant entrepreneurs...

02:44.160 --> 02:45.720
You know, we do
wanna be the best.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.040
To make the best burger
they've ever had,

02:48.080 --> 02:50.760
[narrator]
...who think their concept
is worth big money.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.320
There's an explosion
of these... these concepts.
They're really successful.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.200
[narrator]
Over 400 people competed
for the chance to run

02:58.240 --> 02:59.480
a trial pop-up,

02:59.520 --> 03:01.800
to prove their idea
was worth investment.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.920
Conceptually, it's
very simple to do,

03:03.960 --> 03:05.480
it's very Instagramable.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.920
[narrator]
The panel chose the two ideas

03:06.960 --> 03:09.840
with the strongest food,
brand, and business plan.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.480
FINCA is a Cuban
street food concept

03:14.520 --> 03:17.640
based in Liverpool, which
has been trading there
for the past 18 months.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.920
[narrator]
The first idea to be selected,

03:19.960 --> 03:22.960
a group of friends,
who think Britain's
high street is ready

03:23.000 --> 03:24.720
for a Cuban food revolution.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.680
[man] The reason
why we chose
Cuban street food,

03:26.720 --> 03:29.280
is because we believe
it's a cuisine that hasn't
really been delved into.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.920
There's also a huge opportunity
for drink sales
in our restaurant.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.280
We have trialed
our Cuban cocktail menu

03:34.320 --> 03:35.880
at some of the pop-up events
that we've done.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.520
It has been very,
very successful.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.760
[narrator]
The young team at FINCA
are asking for £150,000

03:43.800 --> 03:46.320
to open their first,
proper place.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.720
I think this business is
very much of the moment.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.920
Great team, great brand,
great product.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.240
[Lydia]
I think they're fantastic.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.880
Such a cool new concept.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.160
In Berlin,

03:55.200 --> 03:57.080
we've got this rooftop bar
on top of our hotel

03:57.120 --> 03:59.720
to roam there which I think
would just be amazing.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.240
I couldn't see a Cuban
surname in the four owners.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.520
They looked authentic.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.800
They also did say
their take on Cuban food.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.480
Just raising a point.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.960
They've got a great brand,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.680
they seem
incredibly passionate.

04:11.720 --> 04:15.200
There was nothing I saw
that didn't tick
pretty much all the boxes.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.480
Food offer's really strong.
It screams fun, and I'd love
to see it in Manchester.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.640
My name is Jeremy Roberts,

04:20.680 --> 04:22.560
I am the CEO
of Living Ventures,

04:22.600 --> 04:25.600
which is a group of
45 or so restaurants.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.680
FINCA excites me.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.120
It's... It's sexy.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.400
I think it's a great name.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.280
That gives you a huge
amount of potential

04:31.320 --> 04:33.800
for the...
the booze side of things,
the bar element to it.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.520
I think this has definitely
got the opportunity
to be a national brand,

04:36.560 --> 04:39.520
you know, in 10, 15 sites
across the UK, unquestionably.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.480
My name's Darrel,
I'm a partner at Imbiba.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.960
We're ultimately looking
to build these businesses

04:44.000 --> 04:45.800
to 10, 15 units.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.240
And that requires investment
of up to five, six,
seven million.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.160
If there's a chemistry,
if there's a spark there,

04:52.200 --> 04:53.680
we will push you hard.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.720
Hi, my name's Chelsea.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.240
And I love, love,
love, love, food.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.040
[narrator] Next,
a 27-year old who wants
to sell vegan food

05:02.080 --> 05:04.520
that appeals to everyone.

05:04.560 --> 05:05.800
[Chelsea] Wholesome Junkies

05:05.840 --> 05:08.200
is vegan junk food
with a wholesome taste.

05:08.240 --> 05:11.760
It is an exciting new way
of looking at eating
vegan food.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.800
[narrator]
Chelsea's after £95,000
to start her first restaurant.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.280
[Chelsea] I want to take
Wholesome Junkies
to the next level

05:18.320 --> 05:19.840
and that means
having my own unit,

05:19.880 --> 05:22.640
and to work
with a really nice
big, lovely team

05:22.680 --> 05:24.160
Thank you so much for watching.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.560
And I really hope you share
the same vision as I see.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.560
[Lydia] I thought she was
super enthusiastic,
which is great,

05:31.600 --> 05:34.200
but I have to say that
I thought the branding sucked.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.760
I'm trying to think of

05:35.800 --> 05:38.320
somebody who'd want to go
and have an unhealthy, fried,

05:38.360 --> 05:39.640
but a vegan food.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.720
I don't mind the idea
of vegan junk food.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.160
My name's Chris Miller.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.400
She's trying to do
vegan junk food.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.600
The junk food burger
market in the UK is

05:50.640 --> 05:53.000
a three billion pound market.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.480
So, if she can take
a fraction of that market,

05:55.520 --> 05:58.000
then it will be a very exciting
investment opportunity.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.640
I'd like to be able to see
one of these in every

06:00.680 --> 06:03.480
university, town across the UK.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.600
[narrator]
The ideas have been chosen.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.880
There's just
one person interested
in Wholesome Junkies.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.560
But four investors
could end up
fighting over FINCA.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.280
[Fred]
Wholesome Junkies and FINCA

06:29.320 --> 06:31.600
are open today
for business in Manchester.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.720
They are here to prove
they've got what it takes

06:33.760 --> 06:35.080
to take over the high street.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.560
Get it right,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.240
and they could
secure an investment

06:38.280 --> 06:41.280
that will change
their lives forever.

06:41.320 --> 06:45.480
[narrator] The two ideas
will take over identical
existing restaurant sites,

06:45.520 --> 06:48.000
just 100 yards apart.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.560
Today, Chelsea,
and the FINCA team

06:50.600 --> 06:54.520
are about to see
their new restaurants
for the first time.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.280
[Joe] This opportunity's
absolutely huge.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.560
We're gonna be meeting
some of the biggest investors

06:59.120 --> 07:00.080
in the UK.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.280
Looking good, that.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.440
Nice menu, that.

07:03.480 --> 07:04.560
-Let's get going.
-Let's do it.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.920
Hey-yo.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
Yes, laddie.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.800
[narrator]
Over the last month, they've
been working with a designer

07:11.840 --> 07:13.600
to bring their
restaurant to life.

07:14.440 --> 07:15.720
[chuckling] This is class.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.880
This is superb.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.480
We're not gonna stop
fighting for this.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.800
We're gonna work
as hard as we can

07:20.840 --> 07:22.600
to make sure that
everything goes well.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.960
This opportunity is huge,
and if we get there,
that'll be amazing. Yeah.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.840
No, not "if we get there,"
when we get there.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.440
[narrator]
FINCA was born
18 months ago.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.360
as a Cuban-inspired
pop-up in Liverpool.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.920
I'm Joe. Uh, I look after
the PR and marketing.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.520
And I will buzz for you
when it's ready.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.200
Hi, I'm Michael, I'm one
of the directors here at FINCA.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.600
I also help plan the food,
the menus.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.280
My name is Oli,
and I'm also the head chef
alongside Michael.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.240
[narrator]
Thirty-four-year-old Michael
went on holiday to Cuba,

07:53.280 --> 07:54.960
and fell in love with the food.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.400
A lot of people come,
they've never tried
Cuban food before.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.240
Hi, guys.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.920
[Joe] It's nice
when they come back.
and say they like, "The food,

08:00.960 --> 08:02.240
"it changed my life."

08:02.280 --> 08:04.040
[laughing]

08:04.080 --> 08:07.120
Would love to get
the first FINCA open.
But we're ambitious,

08:07.160 --> 08:10.360
so we're looking
at five FINCAs
in the first five years.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.920
[narrator]
Opposite FINCA,
Manchester local, Chelsea,

08:16.960 --> 08:20.120
is also about to see
her restaurant
for the first time.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.600
Being here, and doing this
is the most exciting thing
I've ever done in my life.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.920
Oh, I love it.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.560
I'm a bit of a tree hugger.
[laughing] So...

08:31.120 --> 08:33.760
Perfect. An actual kitchen.

08:33.800 --> 08:36.440
I'm used to working off this.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.640
[Fred] After ten years
of working front of housing
restaurants,

08:42.680 --> 08:44.720
Chelsea took
a gamble last year,

08:44.760 --> 08:47.520
and set-up a vegan food stall.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.440
[Chelsea]
The first event that I did,
I did really, really well

08:50.480 --> 08:52.960
that I thought, "This is easy,
this is how it works."

08:53.400 --> 08:54.400
No.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.640
The next five markets,
I had nothing,

08:57.680 --> 09:00.440
I lost money, I carried on
and persevered.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.600
I'm finally getting there now
where I'm making good money
on each event.

09:04.640 --> 09:08.680
[narrator] There are now
nearly two million vegans
and vegetarians in the UK.

09:08.720 --> 09:15.320
Chelsea wants £95,000
to set up a restaurant
to help her capture the market.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.960
Veganism is becoming
really popular, and it's sort
of peaking at the moment.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.680
And it was now
or never, really.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.400
It was either miss the boat,
or catch the wave.

09:26.480 --> 09:31.000
Tomorrow, in just 24 hours,
the investors will be
arriving for lunch.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.160
We need to get started,
like, ASAP,

09:33.200 --> 09:35.240
because there's
quite a bit to do.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.680
[narrator] So this evening,
both restaurants will open
to the Manchester public

09:38.720 --> 09:40.920
for their one and
only practice run.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.280
Tonight will be
their soft launch.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.280
They will be serving
real customers at just
half the price.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.240
It's a standard
industry practice,

09:49.280 --> 09:52.480
and it's their one chance
to get it right
before the investors come.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.200
The bag's here.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.080
[narrator] Both restaurants
have brought their own teams

09:57.120 --> 10:00.640
to help in the kitchen,
and with front-of-house.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.680
including Chelsea's
best friend, Faye.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.680
When she first made me, like,
try something, I was like,

10:06.720 --> 10:08.160
Uh...

10:08.200 --> 10:11.560
And then I was like,
"Oh, my God, mate,
this is amazing!"

10:13.680 --> 10:15.360
[all greeting each other]

10:15.400 --> 10:16.720
[Fred] How are you?

10:16.760 --> 10:21.480
So, you're talking about
a healthy, junk, vegan food.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.720
-Yes.
-Isn't it a contradiction?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.280
Yeah, exactly.
It's a little bit whacky,

10:26.320 --> 10:27.880
which kinda just goes with me.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.560
So it's a little bit
of what everybody loves,
the naughty food,

10:30.600 --> 10:34.480
the fried foods, but sort of
making it a little bit healthy
at the same time.

10:34.520 --> 10:38.120
What is the actual USP
of your... of your brand?

10:38.160 --> 10:40.440
The demand for meat
can't keep up

10:40.480 --> 10:42.560
with the population
that's every growing,

10:42.600 --> 10:45.680
so we need to find new ways
to be sustainable.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.800
I mean, I love meat.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.280
-[Chelsea] Yeah.
-Would I love your food?

10:48.320 --> 10:50.320
I reckon we'll
win you over, Fred.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.800
-Yeah?
-[laughing] Yeah.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.600
All right. Listen, good luck.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.280
-Enjoy. Bye-bye. See you later.
-[Chelsea] Thank you so much.
Thank you.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.600
-Thank you, Fred.
-[Faye] Bye.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.160
Can you slice the apples
into wedges, please?

11:01.200 --> 11:04.760
[narrator] Almost a third
of the UK say they ate
less meat last year.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.240
So, Chelsea's hoping
her junk food approach
has mass appeal.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.240
[Chelsea] So I need 'em
about a centimeter thick.

11:10.280 --> 11:14.040
[narrator] Her shrooms,
breaded mushrooms,
sell for £5.00

11:14.080 --> 11:16.760
and super sprouts
with Parmesan and aioli

11:16.800 --> 11:18.760
sell for £3.00 a dish.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.640
but for £6.50, you could
have a bite of her bestseller.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.640
This one dish that
I could get the investment on

11:25.680 --> 11:29.360
is my battered
cauliflower burger.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.200
It's called no-plucky
fried chicken,

11:31.240 --> 11:32.840
'cause no chickens are harmed.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.640
And it's, uh, definitely
the most popular dish.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.160
Hello, how are you?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.680
-Hey. How are we?
-Hello. I'm Fred.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.920
-Good.
-I'm Joe.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.440
Nice to meet you, Joe.
How are you?

11:46.480 --> 11:49.360
-Bonjour.
-[Fred] I have no idea
what Cuban food is.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.800
I mean, I know Fidel Castro,
I love Cuban cigars,

11:51.840 --> 11:53.720
I have no idea what to expect.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.880
It's very centered around
the Cuban sandwich, the Cubano.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.960
So, is it like the ham
and cheeseburger in France?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.920
It's got the, um, gammon,
and pork shoulder.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.360
Ah! It's got gammon as well.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.360
So it is like
the ham and cheese.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.840
Well, look, I can't wait
to try the food.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.800
And I've got some very,
very good news.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.760
We don't have one,
or two, or three,

12:10.800 --> 12:13.840
-but four, four investors...
-Yeah?

12:13.880 --> 12:16.760
-[Joe] What good, that.
-...really interested
in your concept.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.360
-Amazing.
-So, tomorrow
they'll be here.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.760
-I'm nervous now, though.
-[laughter]

12:20.800 --> 12:22.280
-[Fred] Good.
-Kicking in. Kicking in.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.480
[Fred] Enjoy.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.240
-Thank you, see you later.
-Bye-bye.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.560
-Come on.
-[Michael] Let's back to work.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.280
Yeah, yeah,
let's get cracking now.
Come on.

12:31.240 --> 12:35.640
[narrator]
FINCA's menu features a range
of Central American delicacies.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.440
Their twice-fried
plantain fritters
sell for £4.00.

12:39.480 --> 12:44.360
Their Cuban fried chicken
with picked watermelon
is £7.00.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.720
Their signature dish,
the Cubano,

12:46.760 --> 12:49.960
is a thick, grilled sandwich
that Cubans love.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.600
It's £7.00.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.200
[Michael]
It does take a bit of time
in the building of it,

12:53.240 --> 12:55.000
and the cooking time, so,

12:55.040 --> 12:57.520
I reckon that's probably
the most challenging.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.040
[woman] So who's
in charge of that?

12:59.080 --> 13:00.640
Me. [laughs]

13:08.280 --> 13:09.840
[narrator] It's 6:00 p.m.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.480
In an hour, FINCA,
and Wholesome Junkies

13:12.520 --> 13:15.360
will open as restaurants
for the first time.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.480
We are about to open the doors.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.120
Um, are we all excited?

13:20.160 --> 13:21.480
-[man] Yes.
-Are you excited?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.200
I am nearly excited.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.480
[all laughing]

13:25.520 --> 13:28.760
In my own restaurant,
I love that feeling
before service.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.160
It's the anticipation.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.880
Everything must be ready.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.280
Once the first customers
walk through the door,

13:36.320 --> 13:38.360
the battle is on.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.480
[man] Hello there.
Is it Charlotte?
[Charlotte] It's me, yes.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.600
The server's gonna
take you to the table now,
show you where to go.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.200
[narrator]
With food at half price,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.920
tonight's soft launch
is popular.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.520
So, both restaurants face
two full sittings.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.680
First check's on.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.280
It's all go.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.920
The sweet potato fries.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.640
Tostones, FINCA fries,

14:01.680 --> 14:03.280
and then empanadas?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.840
Good stuff.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.160
[narrator] Half an hour in,
FINCA are at full stretch.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.640
One veg Cubano,
one meat Cubano,
three portions of fries...

14:11.680 --> 14:14.160
Cubano and tostones,
please, mate.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.360
Just been icy at
the first few orders out
and just

14:16.400 --> 14:18.160
get in a bit of rhythm
of things like that.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.520
[woman] The sweet potato fries

14:21.560 --> 14:23.000
are possibly the nicest
sweet potato fries
I've ever had.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.560
It's really good.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.240
It's really tasty
and interesting
with lots of new flavors.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.920
I ordered the Cuban sandwich,
and it's massive, but
it's really, really delicious.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.280
-Wow, what an atmosphere.
-[Joe] I know.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.480
[Fred] This is full.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.600
-[Joe] What can I get
for you, Fred?
-I must try your,

14:39.640 --> 14:40.920
-er, Cubanos.
-Thank you very much.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.040
Thank you.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.920
We've got one sea bass,
one Cubano

14:46.960 --> 14:48.320
sweet potato fries,

14:48.360 --> 14:50.520
some croquetas,
and empanadas, please.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.680
Chased our tail
a little bit,
but it's soft launch,

14:52.720 --> 14:54.840
so it's how
we thought it'd be.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.760
Hey, check on,
we've got one Cubano,

14:56.800 --> 14:58.600
one sea bass, one fries...

14:58.640 --> 15:00.440
[Joe] Is table two ready to go?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.720
[Oli] One Cubano, and each one
sea bass, and each one
sweet potato fries

15:02.760 --> 15:03.800
and each one croquetas...

15:03.840 --> 15:06.560
And then we have,
uh, cha-cha-cha.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.600
Do you know how long
my food is going to be, please?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.800
Yeah, it won't be
too much longer.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.240
Fred's next up, isn't he, Oli?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.760
[Oli] Yeah, I'll take,
er, two minutes.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.320
-Two minutes.
-Thank you very much.
Thank you.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.440
I love the atmosphere
of the restaurant.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.960
The thing that worries me
is that the service is slow.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.920
The food takes a long time
to come out of the kitchen.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.320
I've ordered Cubanos,
and I still haven't got it.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.760
[Michael]
This Cubano's done.
It'll be 30 seconds.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.760
[bell dings]

15:34.240 --> 15:35.400
At last.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.520
[Fred] The food is absolutely
delicious at FINCA.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.240
Very good.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.080
The thing is, it took
at least 15 minutes
for me to get my Cubanos,

15:46.120 --> 15:48.720
which is basically a ham
and cheese sandwich.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.720
I really don't understand
how this can be possible.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.560
They've got so many
staff in there.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.320
Their staff ratio is
just as high as the Ritz.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.080
How are they gonna
do that in the high street?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.080
[Chelsea]
Everything altogether, yeah?

16:02.120 --> 16:03.480
Okay, perfect.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.880
[narrator]
At Wholesome Junkies,

16:05.920 --> 16:08.560
the half price offer is
also drawing in the customers.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.120
The chips, you can use,
the end ones are gluten-free.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.600
I'm a bit just sort of,
in shock, I think.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.200
Everyone's coming in,
and they're ordering
one of everything,

16:17.240 --> 16:21.640
-So, what, two covers
in, uh, ten orders.
-[laughs]

16:21.680 --> 16:24.640
[narrator] And Chelsea's
got a problem just
ten minutes into service.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.520
I will have to go, Faye.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.480
-You have to go?
-I have to go.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.840
[narrator] Anna, who's
in-charge of starters,
has to leave.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.200
Her boyfriend's been
rushed to hospital.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.480
[indistinct chatter]

16:38.520 --> 16:40.000
Go. Go, go, go.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.400
[narrator] So, Faye will
have to take her place.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.160
[Faye] I mean, I feel like
I can do this.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.360
Yeah, you're on that.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.160
Yeah, you need some
parmesan on the side.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.200
Chelsea's unlucky. One
of the chefs had to go home.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.720
I'm afraid this is the reality
of the restaurant business.

16:54.760 --> 16:56.840
You never know
what's going to happen.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.480
This is a real test
for Chelsea.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.200
How well can she
cope with struggle?

17:01.240 --> 17:03.800
[Chelsea] Oh shit,
the, uh, fires are off.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.920
One minute.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.120
The fire's off.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.480
Er, yeah.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.440
I'm fine.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.560
[Faye] Have we got
the sprouts and the fries? No?

17:17.600 --> 17:20.160
Sprouts are in, fries,
just waiting for electricity.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.600
You are booked in for...

17:23.160 --> 17:24.800
What time? Now.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.680
Um, we are running
a little bit behind.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.480
Um, hi there, guys,

17:28.520 --> 17:30.680
um, we are running
a little bit behind.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.800
Yeah, mate, don't cry.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.840
-No, I'm not.
-No.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.440
[Chelsea] I'm not.
[Faye] Yeah. Don't.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.240
[narrator] Despite the wait,
the meat-free food is a hit

17:37.280 --> 17:38.720
when it reaches the tables.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.320
This is so, so tasty.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.080
You're not thinking that
you're eating vegan food.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.560
It's just so nice.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.200
You'd never think
this was vegetarian,
uh, vegan. Never.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.400
No. You'd think there
was actually meat in it.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.120
[indistinct chatter]

17:53.160 --> 17:54.480
[Fred] Excuse me?
[man] Yes?

17:54.520 --> 17:55.960
Do you know what's happening
with all these people?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.560
-They're all waiting, or...
-Yeah, they're all waiting.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.040
[Fred] So how many more
people have you got?

17:59.080 --> 18:00.720
It's five tables.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.600
Five tables?

18:02.640 --> 18:05.000
Chelsea, I'm sorry
to trouble you.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.760
I'm sure you've seen
there's a big backlog

18:06.800 --> 18:08.520
-of customers at the door.
-[Chelsea] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.920
What are you gonna do about it?

18:09.960 --> 18:12.240
I was just sort of explaining
to everybody coming in

18:12.280 --> 18:14.040
that I'm having a little bit
of trouble in the kitchen.

18:14.080 --> 18:17.760
And just check with them,
see if they're okay
to wait a little bit.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.040
I'll leave it with you.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.280
[Fred] Right now,
in Wholesome Junkies,

18:23.320 --> 18:24.880
it's mayhem.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.360
Customers are coming in,
people don't get served,

18:27.400 --> 18:29.200
the food doesn't get
out of the kitchen.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.480
In restaurant terms,
this is called going down.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.520
And Chelsea has gone down.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.400
There're a few things
that she could do.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.200
She could, for example,
offer take away
to the people who are waiting,

18:38.240 --> 18:39.480
she could reduce her menu,

18:39.520 --> 18:41.040
she could stop serving dessert.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.120
What I want to know
is if she's going
to take any actions.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.760
Everyone's who's finished,
I'm really sorry, guys,

18:48.800 --> 18:50.040
we need the tables back.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.480
I'll get you a bill.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.480
-Oh, yeah.
-Was the food okay, though?

18:53.520 --> 18:55.960
If it's more than two hours,
just be really polite,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.120
say we've got a queue.

18:58.160 --> 19:01.400
[narrator] Slowly, but surely,
Chelsea's plan
to turn the tables

19:01.440 --> 19:02.480
starts to work.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.800
Thank you so much for waiting.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.480
[Faye] It would have been me
and Chelsea alone

19:06.520 --> 19:09.520
[laughing] if, like,
it went smooth sailing.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.920
[laughing]

19:12.960 --> 19:14.840
But hopefully,
everyone's had a nice time.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.960
It's the morning
after the night before.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.480
Wholesome Junkies and FINCA
are recovering
after a bruising service,

19:34.520 --> 19:36.440
but there is no time to relax.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.440
In just about three hours time,

19:38.480 --> 19:41.680
the people who could
change their life
are coming to lunch.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.840
Good morning, guys.
So, are you ready for today?

19:49.880 --> 19:51.360
Just getting set now, yeah.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.320
You've got four
of the biggest investors

19:54.360 --> 19:55.640
coming for lunch today.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.880
It's not about
getting one offer.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.200
-What you need to start
is a bidding war.
-Yeah.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.000
And you can go
for the best offer.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.040
-I don't think we really
thought about it.
-[laughter]

20:04.080 --> 20:05.560
[exhales]
My heart's beating.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.600
Wanna feel my heart?
Yeah? Bup-bup-bup-bup.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.240
All right. Good luck, guys.
See you later.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.640
-Thanks a lot. Catch you later.
-Some pressure now, ain't it?

20:11.680 --> 20:12.760
[laughing]

20:12.800 --> 20:14.200
[Oli] Get them pitching to us.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.200
Imagine that. Ha!

20:19.400 --> 20:21.160
[narrator]
Over the next two days,

20:21.200 --> 20:25.040
the investors will test
the restaurant's business plans
in service.

20:25.080 --> 20:28.480
But today's private lunch
is all about one thing.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.560
The food.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.360
First to arrive,
two of the main partners

20:35.400 --> 20:37.240
of investment group, Imbiba,

20:37.280 --> 20:39.440
Darrel Connell,
and Simon Wheeler.

20:39.480 --> 20:44.080
They've invested
over £50 million pounds
in Handpicked Partners.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.360
The biggest part of
any investment decision
for us at Imbiba

20:47.400 --> 20:50.160
is the quality of the team
that we are backing

20:50.200 --> 20:52.840
to execute
on the business plan.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.680
The FINCA concept,
and the FINCA brand,

20:55.720 --> 20:57.360
there's something
special there.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.320
The question is

20:59.360 --> 21:03.560
whether that can translate
into a real business
that can be on the high street.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.800
[narrator] Joining them,
Lydia Forte

21:06.840 --> 21:09.840
of luxury hotel group,
Rocco Forte.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.960
It's her job to develop
new bar and restaurant ideas

21:13.000 --> 21:14.880
for the five star business.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.440
Realistically,
you could easily spend
up to half a million,

21:18.480 --> 21:20.640
uh, doing a site,
and launching it.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.920
If the quality isn't there,
it's gonna be really difficult

21:23.960 --> 21:26.200
to commit the funds
that we need to commit to it.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.600
[narrator] Next, Tim Gee,
a property developer,
Allied London,

21:31.640 --> 21:36.120
Their inner city developments
cost hundreds of millions
of pounds.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.680
You can't just build
boring boxes anymore

21:38.720 --> 21:40.760
if you want to be
a successful
property developer.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.320
You've got to actually
put the heart and soul into it.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.760
As important as any part
of any property development

21:47.800 --> 21:49.120
in any district,

21:49.160 --> 21:50.680
is making sure
that you give people

21:50.720 --> 21:52.800
places they want go,
and eat and drink.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.800
[narrator] And finally,
Jeremy Roberts.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.960
CEO of Living Ventures.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.080
His string of businesses
features cocktail bars
as well as restaurants.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.440
Bar element's important,

22:06.480 --> 22:08.240
because it adds a certain
level of excitement,

22:08.280 --> 22:10.200
it gives you another
strength to the boat.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.360
Uh, people coming for a meal,
are coming for a meal,

22:12.400 --> 22:15.480
they come for a few drinks
first or a few drinks after,

22:15.520 --> 22:17.080
then... then you've got

22:17.120 --> 22:19.720
a really wide range
of opportunity
to increase revenue.

22:19.760 --> 22:23.600
It's always great to see
a business that's got
an equal focus.

22:29.280 --> 22:34.000
[Lydia]
I love the idea of FINCA
that is cocktails and food.

22:34.040 --> 22:38.400
It's a great,
really lively atmosphere,
attracting a younger audience.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.480
[Darrel] Great ideas come
from great entrepreneurs
across the country.

22:41.520 --> 22:44.960
FINCA look like they've...
they've captured something
very special,

22:45.000 --> 22:49.600
and I really can't wait to see
that the product lives up to
the quality of the proposition.

22:53.360 --> 22:54.600
-Hi.
-Hello.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.120
-How you doing?
-Hello, I'm Joe.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.960
Let's get this, er,
nice big table there.

23:02.200 --> 23:05.080
Um, we've got the...
the food menus here.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.440
-Couple of drinks menu here
for you guys.
-Thank you.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.440
I'll let you guys have a look,
and I'll, uh, be back
to get your drinks.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.160
-All right.
-Cheers. Thank you.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.560
[Lydia] So I was hoping
that there was gonna be
cocktails on here.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.240
[Jeremy] So did I.
I mean, that's exactly
the same thing...

23:19.200 --> 23:21.240
Hey, guys, can I get
some, uh, drinks orders?

23:21.280 --> 23:22.920
Not getting cocktails
today, then?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.280
I'm afraid not today. No, no.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.400
Erm...

23:26.520 --> 23:27.560
Just, just, er...

23:28.280 --> 23:29.880
wanted to get... Well...

23:29.920 --> 23:32.560
It was... It was a lot safer.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.000
-But it is part
of the final concept?
-It's a huge part.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.240
It's a huge part.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.960
I think on the food side--

23:39.000 --> 23:40.240
Yeah, we kinda
wanna try everything.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.040
-[Lydia] Yeah.
-So you wanna go for a...

23:42.080 --> 23:43.440
One of everything, yeah?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.360
I like their t-shirts.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.720
Yeah, I think the image is,
just generally speaking,
is very, very good.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.000
This, this feels...
feels real at the moment,
yeah?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.840
Just wanna go,
get everything right.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.160
[narrator]
On FINCA's menu today,

24:01.200 --> 24:04.960
their signature Cubano,
Cuban fried chicken
with pickled watermelon,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.720
and spring onion croquetas.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.960
So, guys, we've
got the croquetas.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.160
[Darrel]
For a new food concept,
people need to be blown away.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.640
Mediocrity is not good enough.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.360
[crunch]

24:23.360 --> 24:24.560
[narrator]
In Wholesome Junkies,

24:24.600 --> 24:26.480
Chelsea's perfecting
her dishes.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.160
No, that's great, guys,
let's not worry about it.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.240
Yeah, okay.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.120
[narrator] And she's hoping
today might be the next step
in her dream

24:33.160 --> 24:35.080
to be her own boss.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.280
I was an only child
up until about,

24:37.760 --> 24:39.160
sort of, 15.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.560
And then I've got a couple of
half brothers and sisters now.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.880
Learned to be very independent
from a young age.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.080
But I've never been

24:47.120 --> 24:49.600
content with working
for somebody else.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.920
I've always wanted
to do my own thing.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.480
And then I realized,
I'll do what I love
and that's cooking.

24:55.520 --> 24:59.280
I know how to be really
creative, and if I could
combine the two together,

24:59.320 --> 25:03.160
then I'm gonna be
onto a winner,
because that's me. [laughs]

25:03.200 --> 25:05.320
-You can do it. Okay?
-[sighs] Yeah.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.880
-Right. We're gonna
smash it, right?
-Yeah.

25:12.520 --> 25:16.200
[narrator] Chelsea's one shot
at investment rides
on Chris Miller.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.960
He runs the White Rabbit
investment vehicle.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.040
This multi million pound fund
has backed four new ideas

25:22.080 --> 25:23.360
in the last year.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.560
[Chris]
Having the best quality product

25:27.600 --> 25:30.720
does not mean
you're gonna make
the most successful business.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.760
In fact, the ability
for the management team,

25:33.800 --> 25:36.320
and the founder
to actually scale that business

25:36.360 --> 25:39.280
is almost as important
as the food.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.360
There are many places
that I absolutely love

25:42.400 --> 25:44.200
for the quality,
but the management team

25:44.240 --> 25:46.600
just hasn't been able
to execute a roll-out plan.

25:46.640 --> 25:51.440
So, backing the right person
is fundamental to
an investment decision.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.760
-Hello. Hi.
-Hello. Hi.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.320
-Chris.
-Nice to meet you, Chris.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.560
My hands have got very soggy.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.840
Er, that's all right.
[laughs]

25:59.880 --> 26:01.280
-Took my glove off as well.
-Don't worry.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.160
-How are you?
-A little bit nervous.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.080
-But good nervous though.
-Good.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.840
I'll give you a little tour.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.040
-Yes, please.
-Just start you around, so,

26:09.080 --> 26:10.760
-yeah, this is me.
-This is you? [laughing]

26:10.800 --> 26:13.720
This is me, like, if I could
put myself in art form.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.480
-Yeah.
-I mean I'm already
half-way there

26:15.520 --> 26:16.840
with the hair,
and the flowers...

26:16.880 --> 26:18.360
[Chris] And the...
the ears.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.560
This is like a permanent
addition to my

26:20.600 --> 26:22.960
-everyday attire. [laughing]
-Okay.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.800
And then I made a lot of things
like this as well,

26:24.840 --> 26:26.560
which I just absolutely love.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.720
[narrator] Chelsea's chosen
to serve Chris three starters.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.760
Mac and cheese balls
with a cashew nut sauce,

26:37.800 --> 26:40.840
her fried sprouts,
and then breaded mushrooms.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.320
[Chris] I'm so excited
for the concept.

26:45.360 --> 26:49.240
I don't think she should
be looking at
the vegan-vegetarian market.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.440
I think her competitor
should be McDonald's,

26:51.480 --> 26:53.360
or Byron, or GBK.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.320
But the food has
gotta be great.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.400
[Chris]
Had a taste of everything.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.760
-So the crispy mushrooms--
-Yeah?

26:58.800 --> 27:00.440
-...is a brilliant dish.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.560
That is phenomenal, and, um...

27:03.600 --> 27:05.160
I could see that
doing very well.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.680
The sprouts is definitely
something in there.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.320
Yeah, yeah.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.320
The mac and cheese ball,

27:12.360 --> 27:14.560
-bit too stodgy for me.
-Yeah, yeah.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.720
So let's get some, uh,
mains on the go for you.

27:18.760 --> 27:23.040
[narrator] For mains, Chelsea
is serving her signature
battered cauliflower burger.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.200
[Chris] This is the star dish.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.120
Her hero dish is her burger.

27:27.160 --> 27:30.480
and in reality, if you
put a burger onto any menu,

27:30.520 --> 27:32.920
that would be
the biggest selling item.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.400
So, if that first burger
is great,

27:36.440 --> 27:38.960
it'll be a pretty quick
yes from me.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.160
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.880
[narrator] In FINCA,
the investors have a verdict.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.920
That's excellent, isn't it?

28:00.960 --> 28:03.160
Well, I thought about
all the component parts,

28:03.200 --> 28:06.480
the bread's right,
the pickles are right,
the meat's good quality.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.080
It's absolutely delicious.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.880
It's really, really good.

28:09.920 --> 28:13.320
What they've come up with
is really, really interesting,
and really good,

28:13.360 --> 28:15.520
and tasty, but I just wonder if

28:15.560 --> 28:17.800
-is it Cuban?
-[exhales]

28:17.840 --> 28:19.520
[Darrel] 'Cause to me,
this isn't obviously Cuban,

28:19.560 --> 28:21.120
this isn't the kinda...

28:21.160 --> 28:22.880
-This is a different thing.
-Cuban-inspired,
as they said.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.560
Maybe this is the best way
for Cuban food to be.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.600
Not, er, Cuban,
but yeah, yummy.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.640
[Lydia] Joe, you do all
the marketing side and
the branding and everything.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.480
And what... What are
your main roles, and--

28:35.520 --> 28:39.160
Chef role. We play the part
of creating the food.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.200
So when you open
your first restaurant,

28:41.240 --> 28:42.880
and you've got
a general manager.

28:42.920 --> 28:45.680
Who do they report to?
Who's looking after...

28:45.720 --> 28:49.640
We're, sort of, ready to
take on them roles ourselves
if it needs be.

28:54.920 --> 28:57.640
You can tell that they
enjoy working together.

28:57.680 --> 29:02.080
And that they've come up
with a great idea,
and they believe in themselves.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.120
[Jeremy] The Cubano sandwich,
certainly very tasty,

29:04.160 --> 29:07.200
but I think the surprise
for me were some of the,
er, the peripheral dishes

29:07.240 --> 29:10.480
which, um, which I wouldn't
have expected to be
as good as they were,

29:10.520 --> 29:11.680
which is a really good sign.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.240
I think it needs more drinks.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.880
For whatever reason,
they only had beer,

29:14.920 --> 29:17.120
but it will actually do
really well with cocktails.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.720
And certainly,
if I was to invest,
I could help them with that.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.600
The food, from
a consumer proposition,
is strong enough.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.640
It's definitely got
the scalability, it's got
the dynamism about it.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.880
As a team, they clearly
get on with each other,

29:29.920 --> 29:31.680
they enjoy each
other's company,

29:31.720 --> 29:34.720
but it's just not clear
who's gonna be
in-charge of operations,

29:34.760 --> 29:36.080
who's the real leader.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.080
[Lydia] Normally,
when I look at doing a concept,

29:39.120 --> 29:40.600
I really do want it
to be authentic.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.560
I want it to mean
that it has a history,

29:43.600 --> 29:45.800
and, you know, the chef
has an understanding
of the culture.

29:45.840 --> 29:50.160
So, I'm just a little bit
worried that this isn't
actually a Cuban sandwich,

29:50.200 --> 29:54.640
and some Caribbean,
and some Latin American
dishes thrown in.

30:02.320 --> 30:06.560
[Chris] The crunch to this,
is better than most
fried chicken that I've had.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.720
It falls apart great.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.800
And very tasty.
Yeah, it's a great dish.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.680
I just realized I'm probably
giving you everything
fried on the menu.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.040
Should've given you
something else.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.400
I think that's... My...

30:17.440 --> 30:22.040
That so far is some
really exceptional parts of it.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.400
Yeah, yeah.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.520
It's about balancing it out.
It feels quite heavy.

30:26.560 --> 30:30.800
By virtue of it being vegan,

30:30.840 --> 30:33.440
I think having a...

30:33.480 --> 30:36.160
Um, a couple of dishes
which do feel
a little bit healthier...

30:36.200 --> 30:38.040
Yeah.

30:38.080 --> 30:41.840
I think she's great.
Uh, she's... She's got
a hell of a lot of character.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.000
There were a couple of
exceptional dishes in there.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.160
The fried mushroom was...
was brilliant.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.800
There's one thing,

30:49.840 --> 30:54.880
Vegan food already
has quite a stigma
of the kind of hippy...

30:54.920 --> 30:57.360
hippy lifestyle around it.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.400
I'm not sure
her tie-dye uniforms

31:00.440 --> 31:02.200
really help that.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.600
But I think there could be
a very interesting
lifestyle brand in there.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.360
[Chris] I think you've got
a lot of potential.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.680
So, yeah.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.560
-[Chelsea] Thank you.
-Thanks very much for lunch.

31:10.600 --> 31:14.400
I think she's... she's quite
happily doing a nice, local,
vegan restaurant.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.080
Amazing. Thank you
so much, Chris.

31:16.120 --> 31:22.560
But it should be going up
against a McDonald's
as a choice

31:22.600 --> 31:24.800
once or twice a week,
and we just need to

31:24.840 --> 31:26.280
help it a bit with that.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.720
-Oh, man!
-I don't know. How was it?

31:27.760 --> 31:29.400
-That was really positive.
-Ugh!

31:29.440 --> 31:31.760
-How can you not think
that that was positive?
-[exclaims] Ah!

31:31.800 --> 31:33.920
-Come here.
-[exclaiming]

31:33.960 --> 31:35.280
[both laughing]

31:41.960 --> 31:45.200
[narrator] Tomorrow lunch-time,
the pressure continues.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.320
The investors will
get to see how well
the restaurants cope

31:48.360 --> 31:50.480
when they're full
of paying customers.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.440
But today isn't over.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.440
Chelsea and the FINCA team
still have private meetings
with the investors...

31:57.480 --> 31:58.680
How are you, guys?

31:58.720 --> 32:01.800
...to talk business
later this evening.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.360
You have four
business plan meetings.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.640
You've gotta perform in
each and every one of them.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.480
-Yeah.
-[Joe] We need to get
in our zone now, don't we?

32:09.520 --> 32:12.680
And get our heads back...
back into our business plans,

32:12.720 --> 32:14.560
and we've got the figures
where we think they should be,

32:14.600 --> 32:17.160
and we've got the...
the concept where we
think we should be.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.480
[Fred] Who's gonna do
most of the talking?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.200
[Michael] That'd be Joe.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.560
-[laughing]
-[Joe] All three of us will
be chipping in, and, uh...

32:22.600 --> 32:25.240
It's gonna be like
going to 12 rounds
with Anthony Joshua, no?

32:25.280 --> 32:26.640
[all laughing]

32:26.680 --> 32:28.200
I wish you all the best.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.320
Really proud of you,
and really...
Really excited for you.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.360
I can't wait
to see what happens.
See you later. Take care.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.120
-Thanks a lot. Bye.
-See you later. Bye.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.520
[narrator] 5:30.
Chelsea's meeting is first.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.520
Five minutes. Let's go.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.240
[narrator] Chris has one hour
to grill her on every aspect
of her operation,

32:47.280 --> 32:51.040
and to see if they can make
an all-important connection.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.840
In this business,
50% of what you're backing
is... is the food.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.400
-Good to see you
-Non-sweaty hand now.

32:57.440 --> 32:58.800
-[laughing]
-Right.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.080
And about 50% of it
is the person.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.880
From what I saw today, and...
How do I put this?

33:07.600 --> 33:09.720
-Um--
-Nice. [laughing]

33:09.760 --> 33:11.240
But nicely crazy--

33:11.280 --> 33:12.360
[laughing]

33:12.400 --> 33:15.000
But my fear is the stigma of

33:15.040 --> 33:16.720
vegan, vegetarian restaurants.

33:16.760 --> 33:17.800
Yeah.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.800
There's this, sort of,
hippy, lentils...

33:21.200 --> 33:22.280
Yeah.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.200
And would you be open to

33:25.240 --> 33:28.080
I guess, making it
more accessible to...

33:28.120 --> 33:31.720
to people who aren't
vegans or vegetarians already.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.560
So branding is one thing.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.840
On the menu, it's a bit
rough around the edges
at the moment.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.040
-Yeah.
-Um...

33:38.080 --> 33:39.280
It can't all be fried.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.000
There's gotta be
a slightly more of...

33:41.040 --> 33:43.320
a few more levels on the menu.

33:46.040 --> 33:48.160
[narrator]
During the meeting,
the investors can choose

33:48.200 --> 33:49.720
to spell out the offer
they'll make

33:49.760 --> 33:52.480
if, and only if
they decide to invest.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.240
Should tomorrow impress,

33:56.280 --> 34:00.280
the offer would be
closer to, um,

34:00.320 --> 34:02.960
-spending time
on the branding...
-Yeah.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.640
Getting you in with
my development chefs,

34:05.680 --> 34:09.440
to actually help you structure
that menu to do it en masse

34:09.480 --> 34:12.520
with the ultimate goal
of putting it
into a standalone site,

34:12.560 --> 34:17.000
that will be way more
than the money
that you've asked for,

34:17.040 --> 34:19.040
it would be closer to £400,000.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.440
-There's a lot of
work to be done.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:22.480 --> 34:26.400
But I do think there
could be something
quite interesting in this...

34:26.440 --> 34:28.720
-Okay.
-...if it's packaged right.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.840
-Interesting.
-Without tie-dye.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.480
[Chelsea laughing]

34:32.520 --> 34:34.720
[Chris] She's a bit rough
around the edges.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.400
The business acumen
needs a bit of work.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.120
But it's got potential
to turn into something...
Into something big.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.200
He just said that
it's gonna need
about £400,000 investment,

34:48.240 --> 34:51.280
which is just like
next level crazy.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.440
This meeting tomorrow is
a hell of a lot scarier

34:54.480 --> 34:57.760
because it needs
to be shipshape perfect.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.920
[narrator]
Now, it's FINCA's turn.

35:07.640 --> 35:11.800
As all four investors
see FINCA as a serious
business opportunity,

35:11.840 --> 35:16.480
they'll each have their
own hour alone with
Oli, Joe and Michael.

35:16.520 --> 35:20.280
The boys are asking
for a £150,000 investment.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.680
My biggest concern, personally,

35:28.720 --> 35:31.480
is the authenticity
of the concept.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.760
Yeah, it isn't authentic
Cuban street food,

35:36.800 --> 35:38.680
'cause we're not Cuban. Um...

35:38.720 --> 35:42.080
We were inspired by them,
ultimately, we were inspired
by the place, you know,

35:42.120 --> 35:45.920
-inspired by the food.
-But you've been to Cuba
once ten years ago,

35:45.960 --> 35:47.480
-you guys haven't.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.360
None of you are Cuban.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.480
Perhaps, um,

35:52.520 --> 35:56.520
you know, addressing that
once we get more
of a full time...

35:56.560 --> 35:58.560
Well, not full-time operation,
but a bigger operation--

35:58.600 --> 36:01.320
Or even if it's you guys,
um, going to Cuba.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.640
Yeah.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.360
When I do something
in one of our hotels,

36:07.400 --> 36:08.680
I always want it

36:08.720 --> 36:13.280
to be the best possible version
of that cuisine.

36:13.320 --> 36:18.480
And so, it's... It's hard
for me to sell a concept
which is Cuban-inspired,

36:18.520 --> 36:21.520
but there's no
real story behind it.

36:26.080 --> 36:30.520
[Lydia] The problem
is the authenticity of
the Cuban-inspired concept.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.560
If I'm going to be
totally honest,

36:34.680 --> 36:37.040
after today, I think

36:37.080 --> 36:39.800
that you're gonna
have a great future,

36:39.840 --> 36:43.080
but I think, maybe,
it's not the best thing for us.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.240
Okay, that's fair enough.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.080
[Lydia] Going into
the meeting with them,

36:48.120 --> 36:50.120
I wanted to give them
a chance to tell me

36:50.160 --> 36:55.080
that there was
a little bit more depth
to the Cuban inspiration,

36:55.120 --> 36:58.520
um, and it just... Yeah,
it was clear that
there really wasn't,

36:58.560 --> 37:00.800
and I think, that was
the moment when I thought,

37:01.760 --> 37:02.920
better let them move on.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.080
It was a major blow, like,

37:04.120 --> 37:06.000
you know, we were
going in there,

37:06.040 --> 37:09.360
being really positive and then
it was a bit of a, like,
comeback to answer with,

37:09.400 --> 37:10.600
and reality check.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.040
[narrator] Lydia Forte
has pulled out.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.440
The other investors
have strong views, too.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.280
Um, first thing
I'd like to say is, um,

37:21.320 --> 37:23.760
yeah, food wise, I thought
it was really good.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.840
What I was displeased about
was it kind of

37:25.880 --> 37:29.880
just feels to me
like it's crying out
for cocktails.

37:29.920 --> 37:34.080
There was a reason behind
deciding to leave them
off the menu today.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.160
Erm, mainly due to the fact
that we...

37:36.200 --> 37:40.360
That it's not an area
we are directly experienced in.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.240
In terms of profitability,
yeah, bars are more profitable,

37:43.280 --> 37:46.000
because you don't need
as many people
to deliver the product.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.680
A plate of food needs chefs,
it needs waiters.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.160
A bar, you really
only need a bartender.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.960
Simple economics.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.240
To me, the most
directly comparable brand
in the market is Turtle Bay.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.040
They've got a huge bar area,

37:59.080 --> 38:02.000
and it's full of students,
spending boat loads
of money on cocktails.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.720
Yeah, we probably should
have gone bigger on that
side on the business plan

38:04.760 --> 38:06.560
to get that across.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.920
You know, it's gotta be
really important, upfront
and center in your brand.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.080
Yeah.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.080
So who's the boss?

38:16.120 --> 38:19.880
Um, I guess we all
take control of our
different areas.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.640
-Mmm-hmm.
-It might sound
a bit of a...

38:22.680 --> 38:23.720
Cop-out.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.320
When you're leading a business,
you need someone to lead it.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.480
And at some point in time,
you have to decide
who that person is.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.560
-Yeah.
-[Joe] Yeah.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.720
'Cause it can't be
all three of you.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.600
So, you're obviously
committing a lot of your time,

38:37.640 --> 38:41.960
but what are you
planning to invest
in that first permanent unit?

38:42.000 --> 38:45.120
We're willing
to look at raising
finance individually,

38:45.160 --> 38:47.040
aren't we,
if we're needed to.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.520
You know, we've spoke
about this before
this process started,

38:50.560 --> 38:53.800
like, could that be something
that might come up.

38:53.840 --> 38:57.000
I think, from our perspective,
once you've got confidence
in the people,

38:57.040 --> 38:59.480
the next level of reassurance
we expect to see is actually,

38:59.520 --> 39:01.120
you're putting your money
where your mouth is.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.320
[Joe] Yes.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.680
[narrator] At the end
of their session,

39:07.720 --> 39:10.760
it's the investors' turn
to lay out their
potential offers.

39:14.320 --> 39:17.480
The flaw in the plan
at the minute,
for the first project

39:17.520 --> 39:20.560
is that your budget's too small
to hit the potential
to include the drinks.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.600
It's probably two and half
to three times

39:27.800 --> 39:29.920
lower than it needs to be.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.280
In their business plan,
they're asking for £150,000.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.480
What they need,
based on the evidence
I've had so far,

39:34.520 --> 39:36.720
it probably needs
around a half a million.

39:36.760 --> 39:41.360
We would offer a restaurant,
a space for you to open
your restaurant

39:41.400 --> 39:43.080
within our estate.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.280
-We would assist, obviously,
with the fit out and build...
-Yeah.

39:45.320 --> 39:46.680
...and initial overheads.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.200
-That's how we would
like to invest.
-Mmm-hmm.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.000
[Tim] Tomorrow's service
is incredibly important.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.760
Tomorrow illustrates
their ability to...
to run a restaurant.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.960
So, we need to see it
well-managed.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.720
It's key. It's a make or break
seeing them in
that environment tomorrow.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.560
[narrator] And finally,
Imbiba's vision for FINCA.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.840
In the event we do decide
to make an investment,

40:06.880 --> 40:09.080
it would be larger
than what is in here.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.480
Somewhere in the region
of £250,000 to £300,000.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.240
I think the other thing
to add to that is

40:14.280 --> 40:16.600
this is the case of, all right,
we're really getting behind you

40:16.640 --> 40:18.240
with the full might of Imbiba.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.680
And trying to grow this,
and make it a national brand.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.880
We do not see this
as a one restaurant business.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.840
[Darrel] It's very,
very important tomorrow.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.480
The number one thing
I'll be looking at,
how are the customers reacting,

40:30.520 --> 40:32.800
how are the guys reacting
to a busy restaurant?

40:35.880 --> 40:38.480
This... It's been a long
couple of days, hasn't it?

40:38.520 --> 40:40.320
And that is just madness.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.760
Potentially three... Three
offers coming in tomorrow.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.520
We've got another day to go.
We've got to impress
them tomorrow.

40:45.560 --> 40:46.640
[laughs]

40:46.680 --> 40:48.560
-Well, it's good. It is.
-Yeah. I think so.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.760
It's the final day
for Wholesome Junkies,
and FINCA.

41:06.800 --> 41:09.360
They are now getting ready
for their last service

41:09.400 --> 41:11.280
in a fully booked restaurant.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.160
The investors will be
watching their every move.

41:14.200 --> 41:17.000
[narrator] There are nearly
700 restaurants
in Manchester.

41:17.040 --> 41:19.680
Today, two more
are open for lunch.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.120
[Michael] Today is
back on to reality.

41:22.160 --> 41:27.440
Back to work, and,
you know, we gotta impress
these people again.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.560
[narrator] Two nights ago,
the Cubano slowed down service.

41:30.600 --> 41:34.200
So, Michael's getting
everything prepped and ready.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.320
[Oli]
Essentially, the biggest meal
that we've ever had to cook.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.680
We'll just... We'll be
over the moon
if we got this investment.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.480
[Fred] How are you?
[Chelsea] Hi, Fred.

41:41.520 --> 41:42.880
-Are you okay, Chelsea?
-[Chelsea] I'm good.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.080
-Hi, guys, how are you?
-[all staff greeting]

41:45.120 --> 41:46.920
[Fred] How did it go
with Chris yesterday?

41:46.960 --> 41:50.240
Um, he said some
good points yesterday
that I took on board.

41:50.280 --> 41:52.520
One thing was the tie-dye,
lose the tie-dye.

41:52.560 --> 41:55.200
He said it's got
a bad stigma,
it's too hippy.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.200
So, I went straight out,
I bought all new T-shirts.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.960
We're gonna change
the restaurant slightly,
just strip it back.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.240
[Fred] Yeah, I agree with that.
[Chelsea] A bit more
casual dining.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.440
[Fred] Simple.
[Chelsea] Simple. And also,

42:05.480 --> 42:08.640
he said that he could
probably do with a bit more
variety on the menu.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.920
Maybe a little less
fried food options.

42:10.960 --> 42:14.160
So, last night I went out,
and we've got three
new specials on

42:14.200 --> 42:15.720
and a dessert for him,

42:15.760 --> 42:19.840
that are all non-fried,
just to show him
what we can do.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.880
Um, a bit of versatility,
a bit of on-the-spot thinking.

42:23.920 --> 42:27.920
Well, but you know
that everything is down
to that lunch today.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.320
-[Chelsea] Everything.
-You've got three hours

42:30.360 --> 42:32.080
to prove him what you can do.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.400
Yeah, we're on it.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.960
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.320
-Good luck, guys.
-Thank you. Bye.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.880
See you later.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.240
Let's do this. Team Junkies!

42:41.280 --> 42:42.880
-[applause]
-Whoo! [chuckles]

42:46.400 --> 42:48.040
[narrator] 12:30. Lunch time.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.520
[Joe] Hello, is it Victoria?

42:49.560 --> 42:51.200
-[woman] Yes, it is.
-Yeah, good stuff.
Come with me.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.000
[narrator] And FINCA is open.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.200
Cubano, CFC, empanadas,
and croqueta.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.240
I'm in the zone.
I'm in the zone.

42:57.280 --> 43:00.440
[narrator] The investors
will expect to see
a front of the house operation

43:00.480 --> 43:02.560
as convincing as the food.

43:06.560 --> 43:09.960
Jeremy Roberts is first in.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Hello, Jeremy,
how is it going?
Are you okay?

43:12.040 --> 43:14.120
[Jeremy] The conclusion
that I came to last night,

43:14.160 --> 43:17.160
was essentially that
the investment that
the guys are looking for

43:17.200 --> 43:20.840
is not what it's gonna take to
get a first restaurant going.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.920
To their flaw,
the risk profile goes up.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.280
[narrator] Next, Imbiba.

43:26.320 --> 43:29.200
Third partner, Fraser Bradshaw
has joined them.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.640
The full board
needs to be together
to agree a major deal.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.360
Yeah, we're still good.
Thank you.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.640
Yesterday, we had
a very good day.
The guys really delivered.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.640
But it was a small,
dining environment.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.920
Today, busy,
bustling restaurant.

43:40.960 --> 43:42.040
It's all to play for.

43:43.440 --> 43:46.200
[narrator] And finally,
Allied London's Tim Gee.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.480
[Michael] Veg Cubano,
no pickle,

43:55.520 --> 43:57.720
one sea bass,
one sweet potato fries.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.240
Hello. How are we?

44:16.280 --> 44:18.360
-Are you waiting to be seated?
-Yes, I am.

44:18.400 --> 44:19.640
Fantastic. Very sorry.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.560
-What's your, uh...
What's your name?
-Tim.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.200
[man] Uh, drinks menu?

44:26.240 --> 44:28.720
I'll probably go
with a Diet Coke actually,

44:28.760 --> 44:30.480
and can I get some
tap water as well?

44:30.520 --> 44:31.960
-Tap water as well. No problem.
-Thank you.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.600
-And the menu's just there.
-Yeah.

44:33.640 --> 44:34.680
Thanks.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.400
[narrator] Chris Miller's
booked in at Wholesome Junkies.

44:43.440 --> 44:45.240
[Chelsea] Hello, Chris.

44:45.280 --> 44:48.120
It's Chelsea's
last chance to impress.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.840
I hope you've noticed
we've kinda stripped
everything back

44:50.880 --> 44:53.520
to sort of how it would be,
and it looks so much
better as well.

44:53.560 --> 44:54.760
[Chris] Yeah.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.160
[Chelsea] So, I'll send
the dish over to you.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.720
-Thanks very much.
-No problem.

44:58.760 --> 45:02.560
[Chris] The colorful,
floral table-cloths
have disappeared.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.880
And the tie-dye
T-shirts are also gone.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.240
So, she's definitely taken
a few things on board.

45:08.280 --> 45:11.560
When we met yesterday,
she was very excited,
but a little bit silly.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.000
In the kitchen, she's clearly
actually running the show.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.760
I've got your two
cheesy balls, and you've
got two sprouts there,

45:16.800 --> 45:19.320
you've got one Kung Pao here,
you've got one more
Kung Pao on the way.

45:19.360 --> 45:22.120
I wasn't expecting her to be

45:22.160 --> 45:26.040
as commanding in the kitchen
as... as she clearly is.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.400
[narrator] Chelsea's lined
Chris up with three dishes,

45:28.440 --> 45:30.760
including her new,
healthy specials.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.520
[Chelsea] Uh, so this is
a Mexican chipotle-spiced
jack fruit.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.040
This is your grilled
tandoori cauliflower.

45:37.080 --> 45:38.560
Yeah, dig in, see
what you think.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.640
Thank you very much.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.120
[Chris] Yesterday,
a lot of it was fried,

45:49.160 --> 45:52.680
so it's nice to see
a bit of a difference
from big burgers.

45:52.720 --> 45:55.680
So, the jack fruit salad
was a lot fresher,

45:55.720 --> 45:57.160
so that was really nice.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.280
Same thing with the tandoori
cauliflower wings.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.560
[narrator] The third dish,
cheesy bites.

46:04.880 --> 46:10.200
So it's a lump of vegan cheese
with bacon frazzles on it.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.840
That's a disaster.

46:21.560 --> 46:25.160
[narrator] Over at FINCA,
the investors' orders
have arrived.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.040
All right. Nice presentation,
Instagram-friendly.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.360
Thumping-big eat.

46:33.160 --> 46:35.000
Plenty of clean plates.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.880
I like the Cubano, boys.
What's it like
behind there? Okay?

46:37.920 --> 46:39.760
Yeah, it's good. It's, uh...

46:39.800 --> 46:41.680
Yeah, it's calm.
The kitchen's always calm.

46:41.720 --> 46:43.040
It feels really calm.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.280
Very consistent with yesterday.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.280
So the quality was
still extremely high.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.520
It's good. I'm impressed.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.560
[narrator]
Half-way through service,
Jeremy Roberts moves in

46:53.600 --> 46:54.800
for a closer look.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.360
Fancy a change of scenery?

46:56.400 --> 46:58.880
I'd like a Cubano coming to
table one and two as well.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.480
[narrator] And there's
confusion over an order

47:01.520 --> 47:02.720
[Oli] We're missing a Cubano.

47:02.760 --> 47:04.080
We're missing one now?

47:04.440 --> 47:06.000
Oli?

47:06.040 --> 47:08.000
I've got one on. I've got one
on the bill right now.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.280
-Yeah.
-You need it now, yeah?

47:11.640 --> 47:13.160
Do we need
an extra Cubano over here?

47:13.200 --> 47:14.760
-Er, no.
-No. Is that all right?

47:14.800 --> 47:16.360
I think you should
take that off.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.640
That's quite interesting
seeing how it translates

47:18.680 --> 47:21.200
from the street food
to the restaurant.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.080
And I can see
quite a big gap, really.

47:23.120 --> 47:26.920
There's no real
front of house experience
in the team.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.440
And that...
that's really a shame.

47:29.480 --> 47:34.760
And, um, the concerns,
you know, are forming
slightly in my mind.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.160
-See you later.
-[woman] Bye-bye.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.480
-[Michael] Thanks, Tim.
-Thanks, mate.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.160
[Tim] It was good.

47:39.200 --> 47:41.120
Yeah, there were
a few challenges, but
that's to be expected.

47:41.160 --> 47:44.040
There are few
other people involved
in the decision-making process

47:44.080 --> 47:47.640
who are waiting
for my feedback,
and we'll take it from there.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.200
Thanks, guys, it's great.

47:49.240 --> 47:51.800
There's lots that we like,
there's lots that
needs to be done.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.920
It's what they need
to do now going forward

47:53.960 --> 47:55.600
to go from a pop-up format,

47:55.640 --> 47:57.720
very different
to actually getting into
running a business.

47:57.760 --> 48:00.080
And then running a business
that scales and then rolls out.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.960
And I think we need to go,
and have a long conversation

48:02.000 --> 48:04.120
about that, just to see
how we want to
play it going forward.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.720
It's been a long three days,
ain't it, bud?

48:05.760 --> 48:07.440
Hopefully, we get
some good news.

48:10.920 --> 48:12.200
[narrator] Lunch is over.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.560
Thanks for lunch again. Thanks.

48:13.600 --> 48:14.920
Good to see you, Chris.
Thank you.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.800
[narrator] Now the pressure
is on the investors.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.280
See you.

48:19.320 --> 48:22.280
[narrator] They have to decide
whether the idea
is worth their money.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.800
I think that went well.

48:23.840 --> 48:26.760
I've looked at 300 restaurants
in the last year and a half,

48:26.800 --> 48:29.640
and I've only invested
in four of them.

48:29.680 --> 48:32.800
The pressure now is for me
to have a think about

48:32.840 --> 48:35.480
where I see her business

48:35.520 --> 48:38.920
in the next three,
five years' time.

48:38.960 --> 48:42.240
[narrator] And Imbiba also have
a difficult decision to make,

48:42.280 --> 48:44.880
whether FINCA is worth
backing to the tune

48:44.920 --> 48:46.560
of $400,000.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.400
They're a really,
really nice team,

48:49.440 --> 48:52.480
and I think they have
grown in character

48:52.520 --> 48:54.640
and in confidence
over the last 48 hours.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.920
How it gets
from where it is now

48:56.960 --> 48:58.680
into a restaurant
and a roll-out

48:58.720 --> 49:03.480
I think there's a lot of
missing links that need...
That need support.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.680
All of that adds up to
a lot of investment of time.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.480
Do you feel
they're in a position

49:09.520 --> 49:12.120
where we feel we could
move towards and investment?

49:12.160 --> 49:13.920
Do you feel they are...

49:13.960 --> 49:18.920
Could they roll out to six,
seven, eight, nine sites
across the country

49:18.960 --> 49:21.080
over the next four
or five years?

49:21.120 --> 49:22.400
That is a big question.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.480
-How are you?
-Hi, Fred.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.000
Oh, you've got a nice smile.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.480
-I'm nervous.
-Are you?

49:36.520 --> 49:38.200
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-Well, look.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.200
Chris now has a deadline.

49:40.240 --> 49:43.320
-Okay.
-He has one hour
to make you an offer.

49:43.360 --> 49:44.520
Wow. Okay. [laughs]

49:44.560 --> 49:46.560
If he comes back,
he will make you an offer,

49:46.600 --> 49:48.520
if he doesn't,
then the game is off.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.560
This is gonna be
the worst hour of my life.
[laughs]

50:04.560 --> 50:07.680
[narrator] Chelsea came here
looking for £95,000.

50:10.360 --> 50:13.960
If Chris Miller doesn't
return with an offer
of investment by 6:30,

50:14.840 --> 50:16.680
she'll walk away with nothing.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.520
The suspense is killing me.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.520
How do you feel?

50:34.560 --> 50:36.240
I just want it to be over.
[laughing]

50:38.520 --> 50:41.320
It... It's... It's, uh...

50:43.080 --> 50:44.520
a horrible weekend.
[chuckles]

50:50.760 --> 50:54.120
But it's not about
the hard work only.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.000
It's about the opinion
of somebody,

50:56.040 --> 50:58.120
and whether he believes...

50:58.880 --> 51:00.480
[Chelsea] The business...

51:01.240 --> 51:03.880
[ticking]

51:19.640 --> 51:21.480
-Hello.
-[Fred] Chris.

51:21.520 --> 51:23.160
You're nearly late. [chuckles]

51:23.200 --> 51:25.280
[Chris] Sorry, running
a bit behind.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.560
Um, how are you?

51:27.600 --> 51:29.720
-[Chelsea] I'm good.
How are you?
-Very well.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.520
[Fred] How are you?
[Chris] Good.

51:33.400 --> 51:34.720
Don't get too excited...

51:34.760 --> 51:35.800
[Chelsea] No, I'm not.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.480
...before you hear
what I have to say.

51:38.520 --> 51:42.200
-Mmm-hmm.
-So, can I ask you
to give us your offer?

51:42.240 --> 51:43.720
Right now,

51:43.760 --> 51:47.640
I don't think you are ready
to open a 50-seat restaurant.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.160
Okay.

51:49.200 --> 51:52.040
So, actually, what I would
like to offer you

51:52.080 --> 51:53.920
is support.

51:53.960 --> 51:58.480
I have some extremely
talented development chefs.

51:58.520 --> 52:00.720
I would like them
to work with you.

52:00.760 --> 52:03.480
I want you to bring
the creativity to it.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.400
-Yeah.
-But have them support you

52:05.440 --> 52:07.960
in turning it into
a more complete,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.880
-and a more balanced menu.
-Polished. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:10.920 --> 52:15.880
At the same time,
I have a branding agency.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.160
We can turn it into a brand

52:18.200 --> 52:21.000
-that is a bit more
accessible to people.
-Yeah.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.720
And so, that's
really the offer.

52:22.760 --> 52:26.120
If you're happy,
then I'd like some time
working together with you,

52:26.160 --> 52:27.680
and see where it goes.

52:27.720 --> 52:29.760
I would love to.
Thank you so much.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.160
[Chris] Very welcome.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.640
I am super happy.
Super, super happy.

52:34.680 --> 52:38.160
It's so nice, I have somebody
to give me the help
and the knowledge

52:38.200 --> 52:40.360
that I really, really,
really need.

52:40.400 --> 52:44.560
There's no value on that.
It's just, um... I'm really
really happy with it.

52:44.600 --> 52:45.800
Is it vegan?

52:45.840 --> 52:47.080
It is not vegan.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.480
-[Chris laughing]
-[Chelsea] Oh, no.

52:48.520 --> 52:49.880
[Fred] It is the full fat.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.080
Just a few fish guts in there.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.840
[laughing] Lovely.

52:53.880 --> 52:56.360
That's what is in the wine
that makes it non-vegan.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.400
There's a lot to learn
from my side.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.480
I think she's, um...
She's got a lot of potential.

53:01.520 --> 53:04.280
Uh, there's a lot of
raw talent there,

53:04.320 --> 53:06.440
that, um, needs
to be worked on.

53:06.480 --> 53:09.120
Yeah, hopefully we'll
end up with something
that we can turn into

53:09.160 --> 53:11.040
a really great project
for the future.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.560
-Cheers.
-Well done.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.280
-Well done, Chelsea.
-[Chelsea] Thank you so much.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.520
[narrator]
Now it's FINCA's turn.

53:24.560 --> 53:28.120
They came here
looking for £150,000.

53:28.160 --> 53:30.640
The deadline is eight o'clock.

53:30.680 --> 53:33.760
Will one or more investors
walk through the door?

53:33.800 --> 53:35.360
[Fred] This is it.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.480
God, this will decide
what we do with
the rest of our lives.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.240
Mmm-hmm.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.600
[Michael] It's not easy, this.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.480
It feels...

53:53.520 --> 53:55.520
Um, we just don't know
really, you know?

54:00.480 --> 54:02.680
[ticking]

54:02.720 --> 54:03.880
[Joe] Getting closer.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.560
Hello. Here you are.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.000
-Hi. Hi, Fred.
-[Fred] How are you?

54:26.040 --> 54:27.680
-Yeah, I'm very, very well.
-How's it going?

54:27.720 --> 54:28.800
[Tim] Hi, Joe.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.200
-[Fred] Yeah. Yes.
-I'm good.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.440
[Fred] Tim, we still have
about ten minutes.

54:33.480 --> 54:37.080
We have to wait
until the other investors come
if they do come.

54:37.120 --> 54:38.360
So, we have ten minutes.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.480
[Jeremy] Good evening.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.360
-[Fred] How are you?
-Doing well. Good to see you.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.480
Hello, Jeremy.

55:01.520 --> 55:02.560
[Jeremy] Good to see you.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.720
[Fred] We're still waiting
for one more investor.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.880
The clock is still ticking.

55:29.240 --> 55:33.200
If we were backing FINCA just
to open one single restaurant
in Liverpool or Manchester,

55:33.240 --> 55:34.560
I'd back them to be a success.

55:34.600 --> 55:37.600
But can they run six, seven,
eight, nine sites

55:37.640 --> 55:40.120
across the UK on a three
or four year view,

55:40.160 --> 55:42.840
Don't know. We agonized,
you know, long and
hard over it,

55:42.880 --> 55:45.000
we just couldn't get over
that final question.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.760
Have they got what it takes,
in their experience bucket,

55:47.800 --> 55:50.280
to do that? We just
couldn't get there.

55:50.320 --> 55:53.840
[narrator] FINCA will
have to choose
between two investors.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.680
But first, they have to hear
what's on the table.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.320
Tim, you were
the first to come in.

55:58.360 --> 56:01.280
Our offer is to set you up
in a restaurant,

56:01.320 --> 56:03.240
fully kitted out,

56:03.280 --> 56:07.360
and it will be FINCA branded,
and you will have that
for a year, at our cost.

56:07.400 --> 56:10.040
Our intention would be
to support you
with the business

56:10.080 --> 56:12.040
to see what could happen next.

56:12.080 --> 56:15.800
And then we could see, perhaps,
further locations off that.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.520
Thank you, Tim.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.200
Jeremy, your turn.

56:19.240 --> 56:21.960
When I saw you all today,
I consolidated my thoughts
on the business.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.360
It does need to be
something of a bit more,
um, complete.

56:26.400 --> 56:30.000
What I am keen
to put on the table

56:30.040 --> 56:33.080
is a commitment to £150,000

56:34.320 --> 56:38.920
in order to continue
your development

56:38.960 --> 56:42.480
so that you are in a position
to roll it forward.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.360
[narrator] On the table,
two offers.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.520
From Allied London,
a ready-made
restaurant premises

56:47.560 --> 56:49.400
with costs covered
for one year,

56:49.440 --> 56:51.440
with potential
for further growth.

56:51.480 --> 56:55.800
Well, I think you, maybe,
have to think about it
for a couple of moments.

56:55.840 --> 57:00.440
[narrator] And from
Jeremy Roberts, an initial
investment of £150,000

57:00.480 --> 57:02.360
to develop the FINCA concept,

57:02.400 --> 57:04.200
and open their
first restaurant.

57:04.240 --> 57:07.880
We know which way
we're leaning here.

57:07.920 --> 57:09.760
[Michael speaking]

57:09.800 --> 57:11.200
-[Oli] Yeah.
-This... This...

57:13.080 --> 57:15.200
-[Oli] Yeah.
-[Michael speaking]

57:15.240 --> 57:16.680
[Joe] Yeah.
[Oli] Yeah.

57:16.720 --> 57:17.760
[Joe] Well, good stuff.

57:21.400 --> 57:24.600
So, have you made a decision?

57:24.640 --> 57:26.120
We have, yeah. Yeah.

57:28.400 --> 57:29.680
Let's hear it.

57:29.720 --> 57:31.840
[Joe] Um, so thank you
for coming down.

57:31.880 --> 57:34.040
This is what we came here for.

57:34.920 --> 57:36.480
Jeremy, um,

57:37.320 --> 57:39.000
I think we'd be a great fit,

57:39.040 --> 57:41.080
we'd like to take you up
on your offering.

57:41.120 --> 57:42.560
-Fantastic.
-[Joe] Yeah.

57:43.240 --> 57:44.400
Fantastic.

57:44.440 --> 57:45.600
Cheers. Thank you.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.680
-Well done, guys. Well done.
-Thanks a lot.

57:48.720 --> 57:53.320
We want someone like Jeremy
that believes in FINCA
as a concept and a brand.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.800
Yeah, enormously.

57:55.480 --> 57:56.680
It's not sinking, is it?

57:56.720 --> 57:58.880
Do you know, it was a pleasure.

57:58.920 --> 58:01.360
[Tim] Congratulations
to Jeremy and FINCA.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.080
I hate losing,
I'll be perfectly honest.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.880
But I wish them all the best.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.920
Yeah, I'm delighted.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.920
I see a real potential
in these guys,

58:11.960 --> 58:14.160
and I see huge
amount of passion.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.920
And I think those two things,
as I said right at the start,
are the most important things.

58:16.960 --> 58:19.320
[all cheering]

58:19.360 --> 58:21.600
I hope to make some
money out of it, bottom line.

58:21.640 --> 58:22.880
That's what it's all about.

58:22.920 --> 58:25.480
[Joe] Cheers, cheers.
[Fred] Cheers. Good luck.

58:25.520 --> 58:28.040
I'm blown away.
I'm blown away right now.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.120
We're ready now.
The journey starts.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.160
I can't get rid
of this stupid grin.

58:32.200 --> 58:33.800
[laughing]

58:35.960 --> 58:37.480
Got a difficult
table over there.

58:37.520 --> 58:40.040
[waiter] Are you not feeling
the chicken burger?

58:40.080 --> 58:43.440
[Atul] I heard that
your food didn't go well,
so apologies on the house.

58:43.480 --> 58:46.280
For you, Ronnie, especially,
being a chef and a very
confident chef,

58:46.320 --> 58:47.760
I felt that you were
a little arrogant.

58:47.800 --> 58:49.600
[man] I need two fettuccines
straight in, Chef.

58:49.640 --> 58:51.240
We've got
no more cream left.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.080
-[woman] What's happened?
-Uh, we ran out
of white-wine cream

58:53.120 --> 58:54.440
[sighing]
