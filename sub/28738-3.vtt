that we did.

34:35.824 --> 34:36.940
Those things are private.

34:37.033 --> 34:38.469
That's because you
don't want to know.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.405
Because none
of it matters.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.042
Look at you,

34:49.045 --> 34:50.877
all the gifts
you've been given.

34:52.007 --> 34:55.876
But you need everything
to be exactly how you want.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.545
A spoiled little girl.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.685
I'm sorry.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.982
You know there's no place
in this world for you without Fred.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.314
(CRYING)

35:31.379 --> 35:34.372
You need to take a deep breath
and see things.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.423
You're a beautiful woman.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.135
And Fred,

35:38.219 --> 35:41.587
you and Fred together,
the Waterfords?

35:42.182 --> 35:43.218
(CHUCKLES)

35:44.267 --> 35:45.383
What a fine couple.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.389
That doesn't mean anything.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.890
PAMELA: It can.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.519
It can mean everything,
if you let it.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.941
(SOBBING) Oh, God.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.148
Stop, Serena.
Enough drama!

35:57.238 --> 35:58.570
(SERENA CONTINUES SOBBING)

35:59.866 --> 36:02.984
It's the worst thing in the world
to watch your child in pain.

The worst pain
any mother could bear.

No, it isn't.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.042
What?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.124
It's not the worst.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.800
It might help you to stop indulging
those feelings.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.552
The self-pity.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.688
You gave
that baby away.

a hot bath.

You're not here for me.

How did this happen?

37:51.853 --> 37:52.969
It was my due.

37:53.730 --> 37:57.474
So you're a Commander now, and you can
go get Hannah. You can get me out.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.192
I'm sorry.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.775
Why? Why can't you?

38:03.865 --> 38:05.481
Is there something wrong
with Lawrence?

38:05.575 --> 38:07.032
Lawrence is
a psychopath.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.611
What do you
know about him?

38:10.205 --> 38:11.205
I don't know anything.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.289
Can you find out?

38:12.791 --> 38:15.124
Not really.
He's too high up.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.496
What can you do?

38:18.379 --> 38:19.836
Can you do anything?

38:20.715 --> 38:22.297
What are you good for?

38:23.885 --> 38:25.296
I'm getting deployed.

Chicago.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.477
You'll get killed.

I think she gets
that from you.

She isn't mine.

Serena,

only a mother could do
what you did.
