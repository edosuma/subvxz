00:02.135 --> 00:04.865
<i>When something begins,</i>

00:04.904 --> 00:09.068
<i>you generally have no idea</i>
<i>how it's going to end.</i>

00:09.109 --> 00:11.600
<i>The house you were going to sell</i>
<i>becomes your home.</i>

00:13.213 --> 00:16.148
<i>The roommates you were forced to take in</i>
<i>become your family.</i>

00:17.083 --> 00:20.052
<i>And the one-night stand</i>
<i>you were determined to forget</i>

00:20.086 --> 00:22.816
<i>becomes the love of your life.</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:26.849
- Hey. How long have you been up?
- All night.

00:26.893 --> 00:30.090
I was trying to figure out how to get
the tumor out of Izzie's brain.

00:31.231 --> 00:34.325
- Then why are you smiling?
- 'Cause I figured out how to do it.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.892
Once Izzie's in the clear,
we go to the Bahamas,

00:36.936 --> 00:39.803
and have our wedding on the beach.
The One & Only Beach Club.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.569
You're gonna actually have drinks
during the ceremony.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.808
Sure you're OK to be up and around?

00:48.848 --> 00:51.339
Yes. I have good days and bad days.

00:51.851 --> 00:55.719
Plus, I don't want to spend our entire
honeymoon in a hospital bed.

00:55.755 --> 00:58.349
- This is not our honeymoon.
- It totally is.

00:59.192 --> 01:02.127
- I want you to meet my friends.
- I know all your friends.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.686
You know all my doctor friends.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.665
I'm a patient now.
You gotta meet my patient friends.

01:06.699 --> 01:08.564
And they are gonna love my new husband.

01:08.601 --> 01:11.092
- Don't make a big deal.
- I'm not gonna make a big deal.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.804
I'm a bride!

01:14.941 --> 01:17.239
Iz, come on. I'm getting her a real one.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.939
I love this one.
That makes it a real one.

01:19.979 --> 01:24.211
- Everybody, this is Alex. My husband.
- Hi.

01:24.250 --> 01:28.949
Husband, this is Austin, Star,
Meg, Miguel and Alison.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.456
Can you turn him around
so we can see the butt?

01:32.025 --> 01:34.721
- Yes. Alex?
- What, are you kidding me?

01:36.463 --> 01:39.364
Oh! A big trauma just came in. That's...

01:40.633 --> 01:42.225
- That's quality booty.
- Right?

01:42.268 --> 01:44.463
- Congratulations, Izzie.
- Thank you.

01:48.508 --> 01:52.376
So, uh, I had a good session
with my shrink this morning.

01:53.646 --> 01:55.477
Did you talk to her about your mom?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.582
Have you seen your mom yet?

02:00.620 --> 02:03.589
'Cause she lives a few miles away,
and she thinks you're in Iraq.

02:03.623 --> 02:07.491
- I am planning to see her.
- When?

02:13.633 --> 02:17.626
- Dr. Hunt? I'm not on trauma today?
- Follow me, O'Malley.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.168
Lieutenant Lowell, I'm Dr. Hunt,
we spoke on the phone.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.575
Major Hunt, it's good to finally meet
you. My CO's told me a lot about you.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.137
You shouldn't believe anything
Steve Mason tells you.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.342
This is Dr. O'Malley,
you've met Dr. Torres.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.580
I'm looking at Charlie's scans,
but not finding anything

02:33.620 --> 02:38.023
- functionally wrong with the leg.
- Except I can't walk or run or move,

02:38.057 --> 02:40.685
really, without serious pain.
I've tried everything.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.218
Medications, physical therapy,
nothing works.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.357
- Which could indicate nerve damage.
- Or chronic pain syndrome.

02:46.399 --> 02:50.233
And we can look into pain
management, but surgically,

02:50.270 --> 02:52.204
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.264
Actually, there is.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.207
You could cut it off.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.770
You can cut it off,

02:59.812 --> 03:03.680
replace it with a prosthetic leg so I
can get back to Iraq, where I'm needed.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.294
- Did you know why he was here?
- No.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.234
- Is it such an unreasonable request?
- Unreasonable?

03:23.269 --> 03:27.205
- Cutting off a limb is dismemberment.
- That kid made lieutenant at 19.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.538
He was planning on spending
his life in the military.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.271
They'll take him back with one leg?

03:31.311 --> 03:35.042
There have been amputees who've
returned to duty with prosthetics.

03:35.081 --> 03:37.072
- Voluntary amputees?
- Maybe, I don't know.

03:37.116 --> 03:41.644
I have to turn this kid away? His CO
sent him here because he trusts me.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.953
We could get another set of scans
and then try an epidural for the pain.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.691
Dr. Torres?

03:49.062 --> 03:52.031
Fine. Do an MRl and an epidural.
I'll take a look at the scans,

03:52.065 --> 03:54.590
but if the leg is healthy,
I'm not cutting it off.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.673
- Dr. Bailey, you busy today?
- That depends.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.974
You got any dying children you
want me to become overly attached to

04:06.012 --> 04:08.572
- before they expire?
- I have an eight-year-old

04:08.615 --> 04:11.550
neuroblastoma patient and he's
gonna live. I feel it in my bones.

04:11.584 --> 04:16.920
- So scrub in with me and see the joy.
- Dr. Bailey, may I borrow you?

04:18.658 --> 04:21.627
- Who is Santa Claus?
- An old, white man

04:21.661 --> 04:25.028
who lives at the North Pole and enters
people's homes inappropriately?

04:25.064 --> 04:26.395
No.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.328
I'm Santa Claus.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.469
<i>All systems ready.</i>

04:34.507 --> 04:37.738
Oh, no, you did not!

04:37.777 --> 04:42.942
Oh, yes, I did.
The Da Vinci S-I HD Surgical System.

04:42.982 --> 04:47.612
Tell me you didn't wait until I'd all
but left the general surgery program

04:47.654 --> 04:50.987
- to buy the Da Vinci.
- Care to take it out for a spin?

04:52.191 --> 04:55.786
Santa!

04:56.362 --> 05:00.799
Hey. I was thinking, you know,
with Derek and Meredith getting married,

05:00.833 --> 05:03.859
they probably don't want us hanging out
in the attic much longer.

05:03.903 --> 05:07.600
So I was thinking
I'd start looking for a condo.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.336
Perfect. Then you'd finally have
a place of your own.

05:10.376 --> 05:14.870
Actually, I was, you know,
thinking maybe you'd, uh...

05:14.914 --> 05:18.350
- ...you'd come with me.
- Absolutely. I'd love to see it.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.749
I am so happy for you.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.256
How much of that did you hear?

05:27.293 --> 05:31.161
The part where you asked her to move in
with you or where she shot you down?

05:31.197 --> 05:33.995
I was here for both. And, by the way,

05:34.033 --> 05:36.866
it's just way too early for you
to be moving in with Lexie.

05:36.903 --> 05:40.168
- You don't have to do everything I do.
- This is not about you.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.902
I have my own future to think about.
Life is short.

05:42.942 --> 05:46.139
- Look at what's going on with Stevens.
- Don't worry about Stevens.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.646
I got a plan.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.478
- You want to remove her hippocampus?
- One of them.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.949
It's a common procedure.

05:51.984 --> 05:55.317
Removing her hippocampus could
compromise her memory, her speech.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.653
She wouldn't be able
to practice medicine.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.318
- I've performed this hundreds of times.
- On cancer patients?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.227
- No, but it's...
- If you do it, I could lose my memory?

06:05.765 --> 06:07.665
It's unlikely, but it's possible.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.531
And if you don't do
the surgery...

06:09.569 --> 06:11.434
We could shrink
the tumor with IL2.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.996
- If the tumor doesn't kill me first.
- Why take the chance?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.531
- Have you done a Wada test?
- Putting her brain to sleep

06:16.576 --> 06:19.807
and asking her to remember flash cards
is not an accurate...

06:19.846 --> 06:22.747
But it would tell us whether or not
she could function after.

06:22.782 --> 06:25.216
- As her physician...
- I'll do it. It's unnecessary.

06:25.251 --> 06:28.516
- The surgery is unnecessary.
- She's having hallucinations.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.259
Nice ring.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.463
Alex outdid himself.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.106
We're gonna have beautiful kids,
don't you think?

06:50.109 --> 06:53.442
- Is four too many?
- Four is perfect.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.581
Ideally, it would be
two boys and two girls.

06:56.616 --> 06:59.813
One of which
will definitely be a tomboy.

06:59.852 --> 07:03.253
And I should have them close together,
though that might be stupid.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.257
- Why wait?
- Exactly.

07:06.292 --> 07:10.319
That way, if I'm not able
to practice medicine anymore...

07:10.363 --> 07:13.457
- You won't want to.
- You don't think?

07:13.499 --> 07:15.990
- Do you?
- I'm asking you.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.970
Why do you keep agreeing
with everything I say?

07:19.572 --> 07:22.439
Because I am you. I'm your tumor.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.069
You're talking to yourself.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.239
- Right.
- At least until you have surgery.

07:29.282 --> 07:34.276
If you have surgery.
Are you gonna have surgery?

07:50.603 --> 07:55.006
If Derek cuts the tumor out,
I could lose my memory.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.135
And if he doesn't, I could die.
I don't know what to do.

07:58.945 --> 08:02.244
- Alex, tell me what to do.
- I can't tell you what to do.

08:02.281 --> 08:06.081
Of course. You're my husband. That's
what husbands do. They stomp around

08:06.118 --> 08:09.019
telling their wives what to do.
It's your job.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.320
- My job is to support you.
- I don't know what I want to do.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.383
That's why I'm asking you.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.791
OK, I have an idea.
Let's put it to a vote.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.825
- All in favor of the surgery.
- We're not voting. No one's voting.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.805
- Opposed?
- I'm opposed.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.867
- To voting.
- Just decide for me. Please?

08:31.911 --> 08:35.142
You don't have to know right now.
Think about it.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.172
I don't have time.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.591
Captain Mason told me you saved his life
four times in the field.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.822
A couple in the canteen,
but don't tell Mace I told you that.

08:48.861 --> 08:51.261
So you think I'll get to go back?

08:53.432 --> 08:58.563
Are you sure you want to? I mean,
why do you want to cut off your leg

08:58.604 --> 09:02.370
just to go back to the war?
Don't you have family?

09:02.408 --> 09:07.812
You know what it's like to have family
who don't know you, don't get you,

09:07.847 --> 09:11.681
- maybe don't even like you?
- Yeah, actually, I have brothers.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.309
Me too.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.745
So there's that family,
the guys I grew up with,

09:16.789 --> 09:20.850
and we've got nothing in common.
And then there's my guys in Iraq.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.459
My real family.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.129
Whatever we got into,
we were in it together.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.897
But here, I'm alone. I'm nobody.

09:32.939 --> 09:38.172
And I've tried. I've tried fitting in
here. I've tried being a regular person.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.678
I've tried getting a job,
but there aren't any.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.682
There are a lot of things I wanted to be
in my life, things I wanted to do.

09:46.485 --> 09:48.476
But none of 'em's here.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.992
This is Alison Clark. She was
referred to me two years ago.

09:57.029 --> 10:01.466
- Mets in her brain, liver, kidney.
- She ended up having five surgeries

10:01.500 --> 10:03.400
and extensive chemo, which worked.

10:03.803 --> 10:04.895
But then...

10:08.507 --> 10:13.240
- The mets came back.
- That's when I started her IL2 therapy.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.980
And now, after three treatments
in as many months...

10:22.121 --> 10:25.454
- The mets are gone?
- The mets are gone.

10:26.192 --> 10:30.720
Dr. Stevens should be patient.
She should give her therapies a chance.

10:31.163 --> 10:36.567
As surgeons, we like to cut.
But sometimes there's a better way.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.233
Let me retract
that small bowel

10:44.276 --> 10:46.107
so you'll have better visualization.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.309
You know what, chief?
Thanks to Leo, you don't have to.

10:50.349 --> 10:54.547
- Leo?
- Leonardo. Da Vinci.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.385
Watch this. See?

10:57.890 --> 11:02.520
Five hundred and forty degrees
of wristed movement.

11:03.562 --> 11:06.827
- Can't do that with a laparoscope.
- Or in open surgery.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.993
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

11:15.174 --> 11:18.905
Dr. Bailey?
Are you making lightsaber noises?

11:19.278 --> 11:22.770
Uh, not anymore, sir.

11:23.816 --> 11:27.047
You know, Dr. Chalikonda
at Cleveland Clinic is doing

11:27.086 --> 11:30.886
single-incision gallbladder removal
through the belly button.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.754
We can try that on the next one.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.691
- If you're up to it.
- Don't tease me, sir.

11:38.731 --> 11:42.792
I'm not. Why should Dr. Chalikonda
have all the fun?

11:52.144 --> 11:55.671
It's impressive, but it took
two years to get these results.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.242
- These were three months apart.
- Izzie may not have three months.

11:59.285 --> 12:02.516
That tumor could start bleeding
in three days. Or three seconds.

12:03.255 --> 12:07.282
- Since when are you not about cutting?
- It may not be in the best interest.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.886
Derek's not acting
in Izzie's best interests?

12:13.432 --> 12:15.332
They're ready for us in radiology.

12:31.550 --> 12:35.919
- OK, Iz, I'm going to show you...
- ...a series of images you want me

12:35.955 --> 12:39.652
to try to remember once Derek puts
the right side of my brain to sleep.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.716
Mm-hm.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.092
- Hit me. Show me what you got.
- OK.

12:43.796 --> 12:47.425
Is that a schnauzer or a Scottie?
How specific do I need to be?

12:47.466 --> 12:48.763
Dog is fine.

12:50.002 --> 12:54.200
- It's either a 727 or a 747.
- Plane.

12:56.542 --> 13:00.911
- Ooh. A two-story Victorian mansion.
- We would also accept the word house.

13:00.946 --> 13:05.007
Schnauzer, 747, mansion,
schnauzer, 747, mansion.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.883
Or dog, plane, house.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.151
I'm putting the right hemisphere
of your brain to sleep now, OK?

13:11.190 --> 13:14.057
Dog, plane, house,
dog, plane, house...

13:15.895 --> 13:18.921
Dog, plane, house, dog, plane, house...

13:18.964 --> 13:22.229
Dog, plane, house, dog, plane, house,
dog, plane, house...

13:22.268 --> 13:25.965
OK. And now we wait for the
brain activity in that area to stop.

13:27.873 --> 13:31.331
Dog, plane, house, dog, plane...

13:42.221 --> 13:44.917
OK, Iz, are you gonna tell me
what you saw?

13:51.697 --> 13:53.062
Show her the cards.

13:54.266 --> 13:55.358
What's this?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.399
Dog. Can you say "dog"?

14:07.279 --> 14:10.271
- What's my name?
- Just stick to the cards, Meredith.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.353
Meredith.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.983
You know my name.
You can say my name.

14:23.796 --> 14:27.425
- This is what I was afraid of.
- OK. Who's Alex?

14:29.802 --> 14:33.067
Iz, you don't have to speak.
Just nod your head for me

14:33.105 --> 14:35.733
if you know who Alex Karev is.

14:49.788 --> 14:53.383
The test impaired your memory to such
a degree that I strongly recommend

14:53.425 --> 14:55.017
you don't have the surgery.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.187
Izzie, it was
the worst-case scenario.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.255
- It has nothing to do with the surgery.
- We don't know that.

15:00.299 --> 15:04.065
I do know that not operating
is every bit as risky, if not more so.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.161
But it's up to you.

15:08.474 --> 15:12.308
- What do you think?
- I think he's talking to you, not me.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.845
- I'll leave you two alone to discuss.
- I'll come with you.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.906
- I have a couple of questions.
- Alex.

15:17.950 --> 15:21.613
Think about what you want to do
for a second, OK? I'll be right back.

15:32.197 --> 15:34.961
You are not having the surgery.

15:37.036 --> 15:41.564
I need you to not talk medicine to me.
Talk to me like I'm your friend,

15:41.607 --> 15:45.839
like I'm the guy whose cereal you eat
in the morning, and tell me what to do.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.038
- Karev...
- Please.

15:47.079 --> 15:50.480
- Karev, I can't tell you what to do.
- What if it was Meredith?

15:51.450 --> 15:54.317
What would you do if you had to choose

15:54.353 --> 15:58.949
between spending a few more months
with Meredith knowing she was gonna die,

15:58.991 --> 16:01.824
watching her hurt, watching her sick...

16:02.928 --> 16:06.591
...or spending the rest of your life
with someone who looked like Meredith,

16:06.632 --> 16:07.792
but wasn't her anymore.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.597
She's the one good thing that ever
happened to me. The one good thing.

16:13.339 --> 16:16.433
So I need to know what to do.
I need you to tell me,

16:16.475 --> 16:18.306
what if it was Meredith?

16:21.347 --> 16:23.713
I would ask her to have the surgery.

16:27.720 --> 16:31.986
You couldn't remember
anything. You didn't know my name.

16:32.024 --> 16:35.824
You didn't know who Derek was,
you didn't know who Alex was.

16:35.861 --> 16:39.319
- You couldn't remember how to speak.
- Why don't I remember this?

16:39.365 --> 16:42.960
The tumor is sitting right in the middle
of everything that makes you you.

16:43.836 --> 16:48.500
I was standing there talking to you
exactly like I am now,

16:48.540 --> 16:53.000
only you weren't there.
You weren't you.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.979
You were gone.

16:56.248 --> 16:59.581
- So what do I do?
- Swender has a patient,

16:59.618 --> 17:03.247
female, 22 years old,
metastatic melanoma.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.051
- Alison Clark?
- After three months of IL2,

17:06.090 --> 17:08.252
her mets were gone. All of them.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.424
You're not having this surgery.

17:15.267 --> 17:18.828
Don't do it. That's my vote.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.308
Don't have the surgery. I didn't.
I freakin' hate surgery.

17:25.277 --> 17:28.473
I'm hallucinating, Alison.

17:28.513 --> 17:31.005
I have really long conversations
with dead people,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.245
and I see things that aren't...

17:34.319 --> 17:39.951
Right now, I'm pretty certain there
aren't birds flying over your head,

17:39.992 --> 17:42.688
because this is a hospital
and that would be weird,

17:42.728 --> 17:46.562
but that's what I'm seeing.
I have a brain tumor.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.066
Am I really not gonna
let them cut it out?

17:49.101 --> 17:51.831
I didn't let them cut out mine.

17:51.870 --> 17:56.466
It's like, OK,
one minute I'm this college kid,

17:56.508 --> 18:00.535
rowing crew and being an idiot
and forgetting my sunscreen

18:00.579 --> 18:03.548
and thinking it doesn't matter
because I'm me,

18:03.582 --> 18:06.380
and life has worked out
pretty well for me.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.718
And then, the next minute they're
cutting into my body every other week.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.185
I had 15 surgeries.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.188
And then I said enough.

18:18.997 --> 18:23.457
Forget it.
I'll row crew in heaven, or whatever.

18:24.736 --> 18:29.639
And then the IL2 worked. It worked.

18:29.675 --> 18:34.476
I come here every three weeks,
I get my medicine, and...

18:34.980 --> 18:37.414
...I don't have a brain tumor anymore.

18:42.421 --> 18:45.788
Charlie, if we admit you,
if we do what you're asking us to do,

18:45.824 --> 18:50.158
the pain in your leg, there's no way
of knowing if amputation will cure it.

18:50.195 --> 18:52.095
- But it might.
- Yes, it might.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.032
- And once I get the prosthetic...
- It will be months

18:55.067 --> 18:57.592
before I can even begin
fitting you with a prosthetic.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.070
Which won't feel anything
like a new leg, by the way.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.165
It'll feel like five pounds
of metal that hurts and pinches.

19:03.208 --> 19:06.302
And what if the Army says no,
what if they don't take you back?

19:06.345 --> 19:09.371
- They will. Chances are...
- You really want to take that chance?

19:09.414 --> 19:12.474
You're asking me
to remove one of your limbs.

19:12.518 --> 19:15.976
You think I don't know that, you think
I want to cut my leg off? Of course not.

19:16.021 --> 19:20.321
Am I sure about this? No. The only thing
I'm sure about is I'm in hell right now.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.384
That I'm sure of.

19:23.295 --> 19:27.129
I've lost everything. Everything I've
worked for, everything I care about,

19:27.166 --> 19:30.693
and I traded it in for a six-times-a-day
pain pill habit that doesn't work.

19:30.736 --> 19:36.231
So don't waste both our time trying to
scare me, because you don't scare me.

19:36.275 --> 19:39.540
After everything I've been through,
nothing scares me.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.373
So are we gonna do this or not?

19:50.355 --> 19:54.587
Dr. Robbins, Dr. Bailey
just performed Seattle Grace's

19:54.626 --> 19:57.026
first single-incision
gallbladder removal.

19:57.062 --> 20:00.225
- Oh, wow! Cool!
- Through the patient's belly button.

20:00.265 --> 20:03.598
- And now it's kind of creepy.
- No, you should've seen it.

20:03.635 --> 20:06.103
No scars, no bleeding,
and about half the time

20:06.138 --> 20:09.437
- it would've taken laparascopically.
- You want to do one after lunch?

20:09.474 --> 20:11.567
- I've got another colon.
- You don't mind?

20:11.610 --> 20:15.740
Oh... So I guess I'm on my own
for this afternoon?

20:15.781 --> 20:19.239
My neuroblastoma?
No, don't worry. You don't have to.

20:19.284 --> 20:22.481
You'll have the rest of your life
to do neuroblastomas.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.388
- Then I'll see you after lunch, sir.
- OK.

20:27.292 --> 20:30.489
- Chief?
- Yes, Dr. Robbins?

20:33.265 --> 20:37.292
- Chief...
- Did you want to tell me something?

20:37.336 --> 20:42.774
I am going to cry. I just want you to
know that I know it's going to happen,

20:42.808 --> 20:45.470
and I just want you to ignore it.

20:45.510 --> 20:49.344
And I'm not crying because I'm upset.
It's just what happens when I get mad

20:49.381 --> 20:51.611
- at people of authority.
- You're mad at me?

20:52.918 --> 20:56.979
I am mad at you. And I'm crying
because you're the boss, my boss,

20:57.022 --> 21:00.480
which brings up issues with authority
and my dad, who you remind me of.

21:00.525 --> 21:03.619
Not that you're old. But you
command respect. People respect you.

21:03.662 --> 21:07.063
I mean, I know I do. I know Bailey does.
Which is why I am mad.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.967
Because it's wrong, sir,
it's wrong and mean

21:11.003 --> 21:14.700
to use a robot to lure Bailey back to
general surgery. I don't have a robot.

21:14.740 --> 21:18.676
All I have are little kids.
They're not as fun as a robot.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.168
And they're not shiny
and new and silver,

21:22.214 --> 21:25.672
and they don't have things coming out
of their belly buttons but...

21:25.717 --> 21:28.311
I will fight you. And I will win.

21:28.887 --> 21:33.187
- Sir.
- You think you can fight me and win?

21:34.626 --> 21:39.120
- Yes.
- Good luck.

21:40.132 --> 21:45.001
Because I have something you don't have.
I have joy! Sir.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.301
<i>Dr. Toretto, pathology.</i>
<i>Dr. Toretto, pathology.</i>

21:55.247 --> 21:58.876
- What's going on?
- We're going over Izzie's IL2 schedule.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.179
Oh, for after the surgery?

22:06.558 --> 22:08.651
I decided not to have the surgery.

22:09.728 --> 22:13.323
- What?
- Maybe we should come back.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.559
Dr. Yang.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.167
- You're having the surgery.
- What?

22:21.206 --> 22:23.674
- Shepherd said this is your last shot.
- But I just...

22:23.709 --> 22:26.701
I am your husband,
I say that you are having the surgery!

22:27.346 --> 22:29.576
What happened to,
"This is your decision..."

22:29.614 --> 22:32.276
That was when I thought
you were gonna make the right one!

22:32.317 --> 22:36.014
You chose wrong, so you don't make this
decision on your own, you married me!

22:36.455 --> 22:39.822
It's not just your life at stake
anymore! It's my life, too!

22:39.858 --> 22:41.382
My life with you!

22:42.761 --> 22:46.720
You can tell Swender whatever you want,
but I'm telling Shepherd, and you,

22:46.765 --> 22:48.960
you are having the surgery!

23:05.617 --> 23:08.984
She's your friend, but that
doesn't give the right to talk her out

23:09.020 --> 23:12.183
of a surgery you know nothing about.
You're Swender's resident.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.819
What you did was inappropriate, it is
unprofessional. You crossed a line!

23:15.861 --> 23:19.854
No, she didn't. I did. I'm the one who
convinced Izzie not to have surgery.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.957
I'm the one you should be
yelling at right now.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.838
Well, I'm gonna go now.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.634
Unless you wanna apologize... OK.

23:38.817 --> 23:42.218
My mother disappeared
right in front of me.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.781
Everything she had, everything she was,
her dignity, her memory.

23:45.824 --> 23:49.453
- In the end, she wasn't even my mother.
- Izzie is not your mother.

23:49.494 --> 23:53.225
She doesn't have an untreatable
brain condition. She has a tumor.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.257
And it can be treated.
Don't make this personal.

23:56.301 --> 23:59.099
- I wasn't.
- You went to Izzie, as her friend,

23:59.137 --> 24:03.039
and you made up her mind for her. As my
resident, go back there and change it.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.838
Because this tumor will kill her.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.650
Quick consult, Dr. Yang?

24:15.253 --> 24:16.777
What are you doing?

24:19.658 --> 24:23.526
The reason I haven't told my mother
I'm back is part of me is still there.

24:23.562 --> 24:26.122
I made a commitment to the Army
I wasn't able to fulfill.

24:26.164 --> 24:31.796
If my unit hadn't been destroyed, I'd be
there. No wonder I can't sleep at night,

24:31.837 --> 24:34.829
or look my mother in the eye.
You and I can't move forward.

24:34.873 --> 24:39.867
My work there isn't done. And until
it is, I have no business being here.

24:42.581 --> 24:45.812
So... I've decided to go back.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.517
I have to go.

24:50.055 --> 24:52.990
- Cristina, come on.
- What? What am I supposed to say?

24:54.025 --> 24:58.792
- I could use your support.
- You don't have it.

25:06.104 --> 25:10.370
Dr. Torres? Dr. O'Malley?

25:10.408 --> 25:13.400
I just wanted to apologize.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.140
- It's OK.
- You don't have to.

25:15.180 --> 25:19.913
I do. 'Cause you were trying
to do your job in there,

25:19.951 --> 25:23.717
your job is to put people back together,
not take 'em apart. I get that.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.722
I know it doesn't make sense to you
that I want to go back to a place

25:28.760 --> 25:30.591
where people get hurt and die,

25:30.629 --> 25:34.531
but we're there
because we're trying to help people.

25:34.566 --> 25:38.696
Save people. The same as you.
It's my job. It's who I am. It's...

25:40.605 --> 25:44.507
If something happened and suddenly
you couldn't be a doctor anymore,

25:44.543 --> 25:47.376
if someone told you
you couldn't do it anymore,

25:47.412 --> 25:51.246
wouldn't you wanna do everything you
could possibly do to be a doctor again?

25:56.488 --> 26:01.255
We haven't been married 24
hours, and we've had our first fight.

26:01.293 --> 26:05.286
That's a good sign.
Fighting leads to good make-up sex.

26:07.999 --> 26:11.059
Are you watching birds fly
around my head again?

26:11.102 --> 26:13.536
Am I, like,
totally Snow White right now?

26:15.507 --> 26:19.238
- I just don't want to hurt him.
- He'll come around.

26:19.277 --> 26:22.906
It might take a while,
but once that tumor disappears,

26:22.948 --> 26:27.282
once you're back at work cutting open
other people, he'll come around.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.252
Is it hummingbirds at least?

26:34.960 --> 26:37.394
I really like hummingbirds.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.565
- We need to talk to Izzie.
- We are not talking Izzie

26:45.604 --> 26:48.664
into having surgery because
your future husband is mad at you.

26:48.707 --> 26:52.143
He has a right to be mad. We didn't talk
Izzie out of the surgery as doctors,

26:52.177 --> 26:56.011
- we did it as her friends.
- Our job as doctors is to present the

26:56.047 --> 26:59.778
options, answer questions and let the
patient decide the course of treatment.

26:59.818 --> 27:03.413
- That's what we did.
- Right. Except I may have

27:03.455 --> 27:07.858
presented her options as, "You're
having this surgery over my dead body."

27:11.062 --> 27:14.361
He has a right to be mad.

27:14.399 --> 27:16.060
- Crap.
- Who is it?

27:16.101 --> 27:17.261
Come on.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.798
- Izzie, what...?
- What happened?

27:20.839 --> 27:23.467
- I don't know. Where's Swender!
- Izzie, let me take over.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.476
Yeah, Izzie, come sit down.

27:37.188 --> 27:39.520
The vessels
and nerves are separated.

27:39.557 --> 27:40.990
Skin flap is done.

27:41.026 --> 27:45.554
Remind me again why I'm doing this.
Someone remind me again.

27:49.367 --> 27:53.804
You don't know what's gonna happen to
this kid, how many fights he could win,

27:53.838 --> 27:56.739
how many lives he could save.

27:58.376 --> 28:02.870
If you don't do this,
he's never gonna get the chance.

28:02.914 --> 28:07.010
We're not doing harm. We're not
hurting him. We're saving him.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.747
We're doing what he wants.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.618
It's what he wants.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.347
- BP's still dropping.
- We need more blood.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.910
- We need to move faster.
- I'm done. I'm at the end.

28:42.954 --> 28:46.583
- I didn't see any bowel perforation.
- It's there somewhere. Run it again.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.489
- Dr...
- Run it again.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.257
Yes, ma'am.

28:53.631 --> 28:55.326
So much for IL2.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.897
You think this is my fault?

28:59.871 --> 29:03.432
- You think I did this to her?
- No, ma'am.

29:03.475 --> 29:08.572
There is no cure for cancer, Dr. Yang.
There's only us, the two of us,

29:08.613 --> 29:12.549
right here, fighting this thing
as aggressively as we know how.

29:12.584 --> 29:16.486
And sometimes that means pumping toxins
into the patient to kill the cancer.

29:16.521 --> 29:22.153
And, yes, sometimes, not very often,
those toxins kill the patient as well.

29:23.228 --> 29:26.459
But Alison had three months to live
when she first came to see me,

29:26.498 --> 29:29.058
and I have managed
to keep her alive for two years.

29:29.968 --> 29:34.996
So I am not about to give up on her,
or the IL2, anytime soon,

29:35.039 --> 29:36.700
and neither are you.

29:45.283 --> 29:50.277
I wasn't asking you to see the condo.
I was asking you to move in with me.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.751
If that's what you want.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.395
- I do.
- You do?

29:58.429 --> 30:02.695
- Yeah. Not right away.
- No, of course not. In like...

30:02.734 --> 30:05.225
- ...a year. I'm sorry, what, now?
- Ten years. Oh.

30:05.270 --> 30:09.673
Well, because I'll still be a resident
for, like, six more years,

30:09.707 --> 30:12.972
and then I'd want to get
my practice up and running, so...

30:13.611 --> 30:15.875
- How about seven?
- How about five years?

30:15.914 --> 30:19.441
- I'll still be a resident.
- So? Stevens and Karev are residents.

30:19.484 --> 30:23.545
Meredith's a resident. Bailey's a
resident. All married, or soon to be.

30:23.588 --> 30:25.920
And happily. Or whatever.

30:27.692 --> 30:32.220
I'm sorry, are you asking me
to marry you?

30:32.263 --> 30:34.754
No!

30:35.333 --> 30:36.891
- Why? Would you?
- Um...

30:36.935 --> 30:40.063
- Should we be having this conversation?
- No, probably not.

30:40.104 --> 30:41.833
OK...

30:41.873 --> 30:45.809
- Impressive work today, Dr. Bailey.
- Thank you, sir. It was fun.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.608
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

30:56.354 --> 31:01.485
- Sounds like you guys had a good day.
- How'd the neuroblastoma kid do?

31:01.526 --> 31:05.018
Oh. He was awesome. The surgery was
easy, he gonna make a full recovery.

31:05.063 --> 31:06.928
That's kinda why I wanted you there.

31:06.965 --> 31:10.765
Because the kids you can save
almost make up for the ones you can't.

31:10.802 --> 31:13.396
Anyways, I'm gonna go monitor
him at post-op,

31:13.438 --> 31:17.875
and then I'll tell his family the
good news. Stop by, come see the joy.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.144
OK.

31:45.203 --> 31:50.266
We had to resect
part of her bowel.

31:50.308 --> 31:53.300
Unfortunately, we weren't
able to finish the surgery

31:53.344 --> 31:55.278
because she was too unstable.

31:56.347 --> 32:00.613
Right now, she's on a ventilator
because she can't breathe on her own.

32:02.954 --> 32:05.479
But you'll be able
to finish the surgery, right?

32:07.659 --> 32:10.321
Yes, if she stabilizes.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.921
And then she'll be able
to breathe on her own again?

32:20.071 --> 32:23.768
Your daughter's heart stopped
during the surgery,

32:23.808 --> 32:26.276
which means her brain
wasn't getting oxygen.

32:29.147 --> 32:32.241
So it's unlikely she'll
be able to come off a ventilator.

33:15.193 --> 33:16.353
Izzie?

33:17.362 --> 33:20.331
Izzie. Izzie.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.663
- You're paging me. Are you OK?
- No.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.829
I don't know what to do.

33:26.871 --> 33:30.432
I don't know if I should have
the surgery. I'm gonna die either way.

33:30.475 --> 33:31.999
You gotta tell me what to do.

33:33.077 --> 33:35.671
- You know what to do.
- No, I don't.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.613
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

33:41.386 --> 33:45.755
You're just scared to do it.
All this back and forth, it's just fear.

33:46.357 --> 33:49.758
But... you've already made the decision.

33:51.996 --> 33:55.432
You made it. You made it the second
you decided to fight this thing.

33:58.436 --> 34:01.803
Just look... look where you started.

34:03.307 --> 34:05.138
Look where you are now.

34:05.977 --> 34:10.676
I mean, now you're this
incredible surgeon...

34:12.382 --> 34:14.112
...and teacher.

34:16.754 --> 34:19.188
You're a doer, remember?

34:26.164 --> 34:29.065
You know exactly what you have to do.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.036
Come in.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.777
You can do it.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.752
You can cut into my brain again.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.083
OK.

34:56.393 --> 35:00.455
You can do it, but I don't
want to end up a vegetable.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.489
- Izzie, you won't...
- No, just listen.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.803
I want the surgery right now.
But, if something goes wrong,

35:07.839 --> 35:09.830
I don't want to end up on a ventilator.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.302
So I'm signing a DNR.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.752
- Please.
- Alex...

35:27.792 --> 35:31.455
You went crazy. When Denny signed that
DNR, you went crazy. That what you want?

35:31.496 --> 35:34.590
You want me cutting LVADs? You want
to wreck my career? 'Cause I will.

35:34.632 --> 35:38.864
I will freakin' cut LVADs
before I let you just... Wait! Stop!

35:39.403 --> 35:43.066
You don't get to quit.
You don't get to quit on me.

35:43.808 --> 35:49.075
Please. Tear it up. The DNR. Tear it up!

35:52.183 --> 35:55.675
Where your eyes are supposed to be
right now,

35:55.720 --> 35:58.086
I see white, sandy beaches.

35:59.357 --> 36:04.021
And there's an ocean behind your head
and ghosts wandering in and out.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.827
I can't live like this.

36:07.865 --> 36:10.026
And I can't live...

36:12.737 --> 36:17.140
If something goes wrong in that surgery,
I don't want any extraordinary measures

36:17.175 --> 36:21.703
taken to keep me alive.
It's not what I want.

36:21.746 --> 36:26.740
I went crazy when Denny signed the DNR
because I didn't understand.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.082
I didn't understand, but now I do.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.351
And I need you to understand.

36:33.357 --> 36:37.521
I don't want you to go crazy.
I want you to have a brilliant career.

36:37.562 --> 36:40.793
And I hope I get to be here for it.
But if I can't,

36:40.831 --> 36:43.823
I just want to go to the other side.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.701
I don't know what's there,
but it's gotta be better

36:46.737 --> 36:50.332
than hospital beds
and tubes down my throat. So please.

36:50.374 --> 36:54.037
Please don't cut LVADs.

36:54.078 --> 36:55.943
Just...

36:57.114 --> 37:01.414
...if it comes down to it,

37:01.452 --> 37:03.215
just let me go.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.794
And right now, kiss me.

37:15.199 --> 37:17.963
Please just kiss me and close your eyes,

37:18.002 --> 37:20.402
because the beach is so distracting.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.755
I always thought it would be me.

37:48.532 --> 37:51.626
I'd get Alzheimer's, like my mother,
and forget everyone.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.843
Let's go to city hall tomorrow.

38:01.679 --> 38:04.944
I don't want to spend another day
not being married to you.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.280
OK.

38:30.107 --> 38:32.632
It doesn't matter how good you are.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.138
Or how hard you work.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.614
You can do all the research,

38:37.648 --> 38:41.049
you can master
all the latest techniques,

38:41.085 --> 38:45.021
I mean, you can be the best... you can
be the best surgeon in the world...

38:46.824 --> 38:49.292
...but your patients
are still gonna die.

38:52.263 --> 38:57.098
Because the next day
or the next month or the next year,

38:57.134 --> 39:02.504
you know, they're just gonna get hit
by a car or find a mole on their back.

39:06.310 --> 39:08.676
And there's nothing you can do about it.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.882
I don't want you to die.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.726
You OK?

39:33.771 --> 39:35.739
I cut off a healthy leg.

39:36.273 --> 39:38.264
I just cut it off.

39:39.110 --> 39:43.012
It was for the patient's own good.
But still, I feel like a butcher.

39:43.047 --> 39:48.110
My miracle case is on life support.
I thought I had one.

39:49.186 --> 39:53.054
One miracle.

39:53.090 --> 39:57.117
I hate this job sometimes.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.994
I don't know why we do this.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.100
Come on. Come with me.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.469
OK. What are we doing here?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.375
We came to see that.

40:18.416 --> 40:22.284
- What?
- The joy.

40:23.721 --> 40:29.250
It comes around rarely.
So rarely, we forget it can happen.

40:30.995 --> 40:34.863
But that... That's why we do this.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.029
The joy.

40:49.613 --> 40:54.050
<i>We spend our whole lives</i>
<i>worrying about the future,</i>

40:54.084 --> 40:57.747
<i>planning for the future,</i>

40:57.788 --> 41:00.552
<i>trying to predict the future.</i>

41:00.925 --> 41:02.654
Will you come with me?

41:08.866 --> 41:12.302
<i>As if figuring it out</i>
<i>will somehow cushion the blow.</i>

41:13.838 --> 41:16.432
<i>But the future is always changing.</i>

41:17.575 --> 41:21.909
We've got one more. He's a doctor.
He says he needs to do it today.

41:29.086 --> 41:30.610
Come in.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.384
<i>The future is the home</i>
<i>of our deepest fears...</i>

41:37.328 --> 41:38.852
Owen?

41:40.431 --> 41:42.262
Hey, Mom.

41:45.636 --> 41:47.194
I'm home.

41:49.406 --> 41:51.397
<i>...and our wildest hopes.</i>

42:00.117 --> 42:02.312
<i>But one thing is certain:</i>

42:03.721 --> 42:06.189
<i>When it finally reveals itself...</i>

42:06.223 --> 42:09.989
Congratulations, doctor.
Welcome to the Army.

42:10.027 --> 42:12.427
- <i>...the future...</i>
- Thank you.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.829
<i>...is never</i>
<i>the way we imagined it.</i>
