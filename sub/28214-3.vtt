19:00.748 --> 19:02.141

Why do they hate us?

Good job.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.656

going with this?

21:08.397 --> 21:11.618
Oh, no. No, winners,
they work in here.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.884
LUCCA:
Mr. Boseman and Ms. Reddick
both swear

21:17.014 --> 21:20.104
that there were no sexual
relations after their divorce,

21:20.235 --> 21:23.151
so I believe this court
can easily decide in favor

21:23.282 --> 21:25.327
of the respondent.Unfortunately, for Ms. Quinn,

21:25.458 --> 21:27.764
my client would
like to call a witness.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.767
[chuckles] Your Honor, Mr.
Payton was interviewed for a job

21:30.898 --> 21:32.856
by our firm and
we rejected him,

21:32.987 --> 21:34.858
so he has a chip on his
shoulder about our firm.

21:34.989 --> 21:38.558
My guess is that's why the
petitioner hired this lawyer.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.560
He had an added incentive?

21:40.690 --> 21:42.344
Is that right?It is.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.128
JUDGE:Okay, do you
have a witness

21:44.259 --> 21:45.826
who can refute these
affidavits, Counselor?

21:45.956 --> 21:47.784
We do, Your Honor.Then let's go.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.960
I'm all ears.

21:53.529 --> 21:57.664
You are going to make
a great federal judge, Julius,

21:57.794 --> 21:59.274

21:59.405 --> 22:01.842
And the best way
to campaign: op-eds.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.714
All we need
is the right topic.

22:04.845 --> 22:07.630
Hot, but not too hot.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.121
he was shot during the
commission of a hate crime.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.080
We were being
cautious.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.735
Could you take us through
the events of that night?I saw

23:08.865 --> 23:12.173
Mr. Boseman and Mrs. Lawrence
pull out of the parking garage

23:12.303 --> 23:16.090
of their office
building at 8:45 p.m.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.787
They drove to Mr. Boseman's
apartment building

23:17.918 --> 23:19.398
on Lake Shore Drive

23:19.528 --> 23:21.051
at approximately 9:10.

23:21.182 --> 23:23.227
And approximately
what time did they leave?

23:23.358 --> 23:25.708
They didn't.

23:25.839 --> 23:29.277
Mrs. Lawrence alone
left at 12:20.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.931
That would
place them together

23:31.061 --> 23:34.413
at Adrian Boseman's apartment
for three hours?

23:34.543 --> 23:37.851
I'm just curious, who was with
the child during all this time?

23:39.113 --> 23:40.680
My son was with my husband.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.333
The current one.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.987
Correct.

23:44.118 --> 23:46.599
Ms. Quinn,
anything from you?

23:46.729 --> 23:48.252
Yes.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.254
Um, Detective,
I assume it was

23:50.385 --> 23:52.082
your C.O.,
Commander Lawrence,

23:52.213 --> 23:54.476
who gave you the assignment
to spy on his wife?

23:54.607 --> 23:56.609
Objection as to "spy,"
Your Honor.Sustained.

23:56.739 --> 23:59.699
Doesn't it strike you as odd
that your protective detail

23:59.829 --> 24:01.352
was assigned the day after

24:01.483 --> 24:03.354
Mr. Boseman's assailant
was arrested?

24:03.485 --> 24:04.834
I'm gonna interrupt you
right there.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.706
I understand what you're
trying to do, Counselor.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.751
But the reasons for Captain
Lawrence's surveillance

24:08.882 --> 24:11.928
has no bearing on whether what
was discovered was true or not.

24:12.059 --> 24:14.540
What was the reason for the
three hours in the apartment?

24:14.670 --> 24:17.107
I'd like to hear from both
on that question.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.981
So, unfortunately,
now you two have to testify.

24:21.111 --> 24:26.160
It was caretaking,
you guys, not sex.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.378
For three hours?

24:27.509 --> 24:30.164
I'd just been released
from the hospital.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.209
I needed help at home.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.647
What help?
What did Liz do?

24:34.777 --> 24:35.735
Laundry.

24:35.865 --> 24:36.910
Well, how many loads?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.564
[groans]Oh, for Christ's sake.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.087
Okay, okay.
Jay will look into this.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.915
[sighs]
My guess is

24:42.045 --> 24:45.527
Geoffrey will try to dig up
inconsistencies in your stories,

24:45.658 --> 24:48.878
so I'm afraid I'll have
to witness prep you, both.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.054
Tomorrow.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.276
[sighs]

24:55.406 --> 24:57.278
Our clients did it.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.019
Did you have any doubts?

24:59.149 --> 25:00.411
Yeah, I guess I did.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.065
Clients always do it.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.154
The only difference is
some are easier to get off.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.808
Well, I didn't expect
your client to open

25:05.939 --> 25:07.288
a Cayman account for my client

25:07.418 --> 25:09.769
and pay him 50,000
for the murder.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.164
That's not what
that evidence says.

25:14.295 --> 25:17.124
Roland, it's just the two of us.

25:17.254 --> 25:20.040
It is what it says.
They have us.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.824
No, that is a, um...

25:21.955 --> 25:23.434
[snaps fingers]

25:23.565 --> 25:27.308
Yes, it is a record
for a Cayman account.

25:27.438 --> 25:30.616
To my client, for $50,000.Yes, but it's not for a murder.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.968
To pay for an escort
in the Caymans

25:35.098 --> 25:36.796
when my client
planned to go there.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.886
That's why it was so secretive.
It was about sex.

25:40.016 --> 25:42.541
Not about murder.Ugh, you make my brain hurt.

25:42.671 --> 25:45.282
You tell a competing story.
You make the climax bigger.

25:45.413 --> 25:47.154
When they talk about
a payoff for murder,

25:47.284 --> 25:49.809
you talk about a payoff
for three-way sex!

25:49.939 --> 25:51.680
'Cause that's
what it's about: sex.

25:51.811 --> 25:57.556
Unprotected anal intercourse
with underage Cambodians.

25:57.686 --> 26:01.734
Two sad, stunted men, both
abused when they were children

26:01.864 --> 26:06.347

of defiling childlike innocence

26:06.477 --> 26:09.872
just as they themselves
were once defiled.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.746
This is not gonna work.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.574
Don't tell me
what's gonna work, princess.

We tell the story,
uh, they buy the story.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.148
Okay.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.976
Okay, tomorrow in court.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.333

The problem is Trump's base.

26:36.464 --> 26:37.726
It's solid.
You'll never get it

26:37.857 --> 26:39.728
below 38%.Because of the religious right.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.556
And the Midwesternsupport.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.906
Even the midterms
didn't undercut

26:44.037 --> 26:46.300
the electoral college
superiority.So, what do we do?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.694
You need to hit his
online infrastructure.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.478
What do you mean?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.132
He has troll farms
in several cities.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.874
Every time there's the slightest
drop in Trump's polls,

26:55.004 --> 26:56.440
the farms pump up the fake news.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.877
She's right. Almost every bit

26:58.007 --> 26:59.748
of the fake news

About being your mentor.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.893
DIANE:
Put it in the mouth of P-Anon.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.243
Fuck, yeah, you're right.

34:31.373 --> 34:32.461
Who's P-Anon?

34:32.592 --> 34:34.507
POLLY:
Our version of QAnon.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.900
We'll make him a senior official
in the Trump administration

34:37.031 --> 34:38.685
who has access
to confidential documents

34:38.815 --> 34:40.600
and wants to share it on 4chan.[laughter]

34:40.730 --> 34:44.386
Hey! We got to get
P-Anon T-shirts.

34:44.517 --> 34:45.996
Okay. It's in four waves.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.911
First, a fake news story
on a raid

34:48.042 --> 34:49.652
on the day trader on Randolph.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.741
The results of the raid
were kept secret.Yes.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.613
Good.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.442
And a Facebook account
of a mother who can't find

34:56.572 --> 34:58.183
her ten-year-old and thinks
she's in that building.

34:58.313 --> 34:59.314
[laughter]Oh!

35:02.100 --> 35:04.580
I got to tell you,
this is really satisfying.

35:04.711 --> 35:05.755
We need beers.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.931
[laughter]

35:08.062 --> 35:10.412
Well, this is all
very impressive, Lanny.

35:10.543 --> 35:11.805
Thank you, Julius.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.763
I think you'd make
a great judge,

35:13.894 --> 35:16.549
so I can't wait to get started.
[chuckles]

35:16.679 --> 35:18.725
MARISSA:
Just a few questions.

35:18.855 --> 35:22.381
You have the Judge Richmond
campaign listed on your resume?

35:22.511 --> 35:24.339
Uh, I do. Yes.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.385
Nice guy.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.127
But I thought Gene Kloves
ran that campaign.

35:34.175 --> 35:35.263
[clears throat]

35:35.394 --> 35:38.353
Well, that
leaves just one.

35:38.484 --> 35:40.007
Melissa Long.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.400
She's probably
the best, honestly.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.228
I'd go with her.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.446
Uh, Marissa.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.796
Thanks.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.756
Oh, no problem.
It's just what I do.

35:52.846 --> 35:55.065
LUCCA:
On the night in question,
Ms. Reddick took you home?

35:55.196 --> 35:57.590
Yes. She was helping me as
a friend and a colleague.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.461
I couldn't have gotten
through it without her.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.071
Does any of that
"helping" involve

36:01.202 --> 36:02.682
having her in your bedroom?

36:03.770 --> 36:05.598
Not in the way that you mean.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.600
Tell me what way I mean.

36:07.730 --> 36:11.952
So you're the tough questioner?

36:12.082 --> 36:14.128
Tell me what I mean.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.565
ADRIAN:You're implying there
was some sexual contact.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.132
But there wasn't?

36:21.004 --> 36:23.964
I helped him place pillows
and put things within reach.

36:24.094 --> 36:25.792
What things?

36:25.922 --> 36:29.448
Uh, small things, like
his cell phone, water,

36:29.578 --> 36:30.623
pain pills.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.059
And how long did that take?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.365
Ten minutes.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.105
You were in the bathroom
for only ten minutes?

36:35.236 --> 36:36.846
No.Then how long?

36:36.977 --> 36:38.892
I-I don't know.
Uh, he was exhausted,

36:39.022 --> 36:40.546
so probably most of the time.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.331
You talked about work
for two hours and 50 minutes?

36:46.029 --> 36:48.380
And our marriage.
And why it didn't work out.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.077
And why didn't it?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.384
Listen, I don't think they're
gonna ask me that, so we can...

36:52.514 --> 36:54.473
If it makes you
uncomfortable, they will.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.000
We were trying to
remember the last time

37:00.130 --> 37:01.610
that we were
in a hospital together.

37:01.741 --> 37:05.353
Um, and it was in the last
year of our marriage.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.137
I had ruptured my appendix,

37:07.268 --> 37:08.922
and Adrian was
in the hospital with me.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.445
He stayed with me night and day.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.142
He's very good

37:12.273 --> 37:13.579
in emergency situations.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.842
So, this was your chance
to return the favor?

37:15.972 --> 37:17.278
Yes.

37:17.409 --> 37:19.715
JAY: And what did
"returning the favor" entail?

37:19.846 --> 37:22.849
What did Liz say?

37:22.979 --> 37:24.894
Well, we'd rather
get your memory.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.341
The painkillers
hadn't kicked in yet,

37:36.471 --> 37:39.953
so Liz started humming a song
to me that I had hummed to her.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.563
LUCCA:
What song was that?

37:45.263 --> 37:49.092

38:30.090 --> 38:32.048
Good.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.835
I think you're both ready.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.924
[door opens]

38:40.709 --> 38:43.016
We can't wait anymore.[door closes]

38:43.146 --> 38:45.192
Yes, I know, Your Honor.
I think Mr. Blum might have had

38:45.323 --> 38:47.194
a dental appointment
that went too long.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.328
Well, get him in here.
Get him in here this afternoon!

38:55.158 --> 38:57.160
Mr. Blum, where are you?!
You missed court!

38:57.291 --> 38:58.945
Mr....

38:59.075 --> 39:00.381
Where's Mr. Blum?

39:00.512 --> 39:02.252
Did you bring granola?

39:02.383 --> 39:04.864
What? No.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.607
Roland?

39:08.737 --> 39:10.522
Roland.

39:10.652 --> 39:12.219
Roland, wake up.[snoring]

39:12.350 --> 39:14.526
Wake-- I got us a delay
until this afternoon,

39:14.656 --> 39:17.180
but I need you to wake up, okay?
You got to get dressed.

39:17.311 --> 39:18.921

Hi. Uh, this is Roland Blum's
assistant... Bambi.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.958
Uh, I believe
we missed your call.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.308
Will he know
what this is regarding?

39:58.439 --> 40:00.702
SPENCER:
What this is regarding
is a plea deal

40:00.833 --> 40:02.400
I was making
with Roland Blum.

40:02.530 --> 40:05.054
I couldn't get ahold of Blum.

40:05.185 --> 40:06.534
So here I am.

40:06.665 --> 40:07.840
What's the offer?

40:07.970 --> 40:10.364
The same I offered Blum.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.453
You get your client to testify
against Avery Ward,

40:12.584 --> 40:13.889
we'll give him 18 months.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.370
[sighs, thunder rumbles softly]

40:16.501 --> 40:17.676
No.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.547
You want to go back to court?

40:19.678 --> 40:21.070
I wouldn't mind that.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.811
What's that about?

40:23.682 --> 40:25.335
MAIA:Honesty.

40:25.466 --> 40:29.470
Make it six months,
and I'll take it to my client.

40:29.601 --> 40:31.472
Six months for murder?

40:31.603 --> 40:33.735
Six months,
and you get a conviction

40:33.866 --> 40:35.911
of the real person responsible.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.436
Face it, you want
one big conviction,

40:38.566 --> 40:40.133
not two small ones.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.569
Done.

40:45.181 --> 40:47.401
I hope you've got a gun.

40:47.532 --> 40:48.620
Why?

40:48.750 --> 40:51.797
You just screwed over
Roland Blum.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.282
I had a ruptured appendix
when we were married,

40:59.413 --> 41:01.154
and Adrian stayed with me
in the hospital

41:01.284 --> 41:03.373
and sang
"I'll Fly Away" to me.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.550
I was returning
the favor.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.334
For three hours?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.292
I wanted to wait
till he was asleep.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.991
Makes sense to me.
Anything else, Counselor?

41:12.121 --> 41:14.167
One more thing,
Your Honor.

41:14.297 --> 41:16.778
I have an affidavit from
Detective Hedren.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.998
When you left Mr. Boseman's
residence that night,

41:19.128 --> 41:20.826
he followed you
to a Rite Aid.

41:20.956 --> 41:23.350
Uh, objection, Your Honor.
[chuckles] This is crazy.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.438
He followed her?

41:24.569 --> 41:25.831
Why was he following her

41:25.961 --> 41:27.354
when he was there
to protect Mr. Boseman?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.705
Because he was actually
there to spy, obviously.

41:30.836 --> 41:31.837
But...

41:31.967 --> 41:33.969
what did he find?He saw you purchasing

41:34.100 --> 41:35.188
in that Rite Aid
a nonprescription

41:35.318 --> 41:36.363
morning-after pill.

Did he have that correct,
Ms. Reddick?

41:42.717 --> 41:46.808
Your Honor, I'd like a recess
to review this affidavit.

41:46.939 --> 41:50.116

for this?You're not gonna like it.

on how the rumor started,

up there,

she's gone.

clown video, is it?

45:29.465 --> 45:31.772
Then why
did you buy it?

45:31.903 --> 45:34.079
My husband had wanted us
to have another child

45:34.209 --> 45:36.864
in order to save our marriage,
and we had been trying.

45:36.995 --> 45:38.474
And I-I...

45:38.605 --> 45:41.651
[sighs] I was talking
to Mr. Boseman that night

45:41.782 --> 45:44.567
about ourmarriage
and why it had failed.

45:44.698 --> 45:46.831
And I realized
that I did not want

45:46.961 --> 45:48.441
to bring up
another child with Ian.

45:48.571 --> 45:50.312
Horseshit.JUDGE: Captain.

45:50.443 --> 45:54.142
No. Your attorney can put you
on the stand if he wants.

45:54.273 --> 45:55.753
So this has
nothing to do

45:55.883 --> 45:57.624
with sleeping
with Mr. Boseman?No.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.843
Not at all.

45:58.973 --> 46:00.845
Okay. Any questions, Counselor?

46:00.975 --> 46:03.369
No.

46:03.499 --> 46:05.110
But I do for
Mr. Boseman.

46:07.590 --> 46:09.288
[thunder rumbling]JUDGE: You've been quite

46:09.418 --> 46:11.072
the subject of interest
in here, sir.

46:11.203 --> 46:13.379
That's my understanding.

46:13.509 --> 46:16.251
I'm ready to answer
any question.

46:16.382 --> 46:19.559
Well, I'm sure I have
a dozen, but let's let

46:19.689 --> 46:21.604
Mr. Payton start.

46:21.735 --> 46:23.606
Hi.

46:23.737 --> 46:24.999
Hi.

46:25.130 --> 46:26.958
Have you...

46:27.088 --> 46:28.698
found a job yet, sir?

46:28.829 --> 46:31.353
[laughs]Not yet.

46:31.484 --> 46:33.399
But thank you
for your concern.

46:33.529 --> 46:35.183
Let's see.

46:41.581 --> 46:43.278
[clears throat]

46:44.758 --> 46:47.108
What have I given
you, Mr. Boseman?

46:47.239 --> 46:48.936
Well...

46:49.067 --> 46:52.200
I'm not sure
how you acquired these, sir,

46:52.331 --> 46:54.115
but they look to be
statements of accounts

46:54.246 --> 46:56.683
for our firm,
Reddick/Boseman.
Do you see

46:56.814 --> 46:58.728
the highlighted payments
made in March of this year?

46:58.859 --> 47:00.034
I do.

47:00.165 --> 47:01.993
Could you read their
description aloud, please?

47:03.124 --> 47:06.040
Each one says,
"Reddick, payment."

47:07.085 --> 47:09.043
Other than your ex-wife,

47:09.174 --> 47:10.828
was there anyone else
working at your law firm

47:10.958 --> 47:13.178
in March of this year
with the last name Reddick?

47:14.440 --> 47:16.094
No.
Your Honor, I'd like

47:16.224 --> 47:17.922
to submit these statements
into evidence.

47:18.052 --> 47:19.880
They show payments
of over $400,000

47:20.011 --> 47:23.666
to Liz Reddick that she has not
disclosed to her husband.

47:23.797 --> 47:26.756
Would you care to explain
these payments, Mr. Boseman?

47:30.195 --> 47:31.979
JUDGE:
My guess is

47:32.110 --> 47:34.764
you'd like to take
a recess, Ms. Quinn?

47:36.331 --> 47:38.507
I know I'm not a partner,
so I'm not privy

47:38.638 --> 47:40.683
to the firm's finances,
but I cannot be your attorney

47:40.814 --> 47:42.250
if you keep me
in the dark.

47:42.381 --> 47:44.731
You have to
tell me everything.

47:44.862 --> 47:48.126
So what are
those Reddick payments?

47:48.256 --> 47:50.215
You're under oath;
it's gonna come out

47:50.345 --> 47:51.999
when you go
back into court.

47:52.130 --> 47:55.568
Has the firm been paying you
for some kind of tax dodge?

47:55.698 --> 47:56.830
LIZ:
No, no.

47:56.961 --> 47:58.440
LUCCA: Adrian?ADRIAN: No, no, no, no, no.

47:58.571 --> 48:00.703
So what are
these payments?They're for your father?

48:00.834 --> 48:02.923
For Carl?

48:03.054 --> 48:04.664
But they continued
after he died.

48:04.794 --> 48:06.448
Some are
just a month ago.

48:08.494 --> 48:09.930
To pay off the women.

48:10.061 --> 48:11.714
To keep them quiet.

48:13.934 --> 48:15.849
[chuckles]

48:15.980 --> 48:17.764
There are women?

48:17.895 --> 48:20.419
Yeah, we have
NDAs with four.

48:20.549 --> 48:22.247
Oh, my God.

48:22.377 --> 48:24.292
What a nightmare.

48:25.815 --> 48:28.340
I came to this firm
because of him.

48:28.470 --> 48:30.124
Because of his reputation.

48:30.255 --> 48:33.084
Which we would
like to preserve.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.175
What do you want to do?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.483
Liz?

48:43.094 --> 48:45.052
Give him what
he wants, Liz. Liz.Oh, no...

48:45.183 --> 48:47.359
Liz, give him what he wants.

48:47.489 --> 48:49.839
He doesn't want
full custody.

48:49.970 --> 48:52.190
Okay? He's just using
that to get back at me.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.191
[sighs]

48:53.321 --> 48:56.150
No. I get full custody.

49:01.590 --> 49:03.810
We'll just void the prenup.

49:12.688 --> 49:13.994
[sighs]

49:14.125 --> 49:16.040
I hate that he wins
'cause of this.

49:16.170 --> 49:18.477
So do I.

49:31.403 --> 49:35.059
Let's talk.
She's ready to make a deal.

49:35.189 --> 49:36.060
[elevator bell dings]

49:36.190 --> 49:37.539
JUDGE:
Hold the elevator.

49:37.670 --> 49:38.976
Oh. Hey.

49:39.106 --> 49:41.152
Hey.
Hi.

49:41.282 --> 49:43.284
[door closes]

49:46.505 --> 49:48.811
I thought you judges
had your own elevator.

49:48.942 --> 49:51.510
Nope, we ride
with the unwashed.

49:51.640 --> 49:54.382
Mm. Good thing I wash.

49:54.513 --> 49:55.949
Good thing you do.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.169
[chuckles]

49:58.299 --> 50:01.433
So you're
settling, right?

50:01.563 --> 50:03.478
The case?

50:03.609 --> 50:05.480
Yeah. Yeah.

50:07.439 --> 50:09.571
Why?

50:09.702 --> 50:12.357
I don't date witnesses
in my court.

50:12.487 --> 50:14.489
[elevator bell dings]

50:21.888 --> 50:24.630
Yeah.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.501
Irresistible.

50:26.632 --> 50:29.069
The troll farm is gone.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.637
[cheering]

50:31.767 --> 50:35.119
May be temporary,
but it's great news.

50:35.249 --> 50:38.339
So where's Valerie?

50:38.470 --> 50:41.212
[applause stops]I don't know.

50:41.342 --> 50:43.866
I tried calling her.
Her phone is disconnected.

50:43.997 --> 50:45.390
And I texted.

50:48.915 --> 50:51.004
We should watch the phones
and texts to each other.

50:51.135 --> 50:53.224
On 4chan, they talk about
Trump using the NSA

50:53.354 --> 50:54.747
to go after his enemies.

50:54.877 --> 50:57.228
Are we really at that point?

50:57.358 --> 50:59.273
Arresting political enemies?

50:59.404 --> 51:01.406
No, but Nixon had
his enemies lists.

51:01.536 --> 51:03.277
Do we think Trump doesn't?

51:03.408 --> 51:04.496
So what are you saying?

51:04.626 --> 51:06.411
That there are black sites
and kidnappings?

51:06.541 --> 51:07.977
I don't know what
we're talking about.

51:08.108 --> 51:10.241
We have a private
investigator at my firm.

51:10.371 --> 51:13.026
I'll ask him to look
into what happened.

51:13.157 --> 51:16.334
But let's not let
paranoia eat away at us.

51:16.464 --> 51:18.423
We're not in a
banana republic here.

51:18.553 --> 51:21.600
[distorted growling]

51:21.730 --> 51:23.906

It's me. [laughing]

51:28.302 --> 51:29.912
[mouse clicks, video stops]

51:30.043 --> 51:33.046
She's writing a text.What does it say?

51:33.177 --> 51:36.354
STEPHEN:
"Need you to find the
whereabouts of Valerie Peyser.

51:36.484 --> 51:39.705
No more texts.
Just talk in person."

51:39.835 --> 51:42.925
Ah, Diane is onto us.

51:43.056 --> 51:44.666
Who is the text to?

51:44.797 --> 51:47.104
No idea. Someone
else at the firm.

51:50.063 --> 51:51.412
[typing]

51:51.543 --> 51:53.675
"Jay Dipersia."

51:53.806 --> 51:56.069
There we go,
that's a new name.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.202
Well, don't add him in.

51:58.332 --> 52:00.117
What do you mean? Why not?
It sounds foreign.

52:00.247 --> 52:02.684
I don't know.

52:02.815 --> 52:04.817
Makes me feel like
we're the bad guys.

52:04.947 --> 52:07.036
We're not the bad guys.
We're just doing our job.

52:07.167 --> 52:08.777
We're just... observers.

52:08.908 --> 52:11.563
I don't think we are.Oh, God.

52:11.693 --> 52:13.304
You've gotten philosophical.

52:13.434 --> 52:15.871
Don't fall in love, okay?

52:16.002 --> 52:17.482
I'm sending him upstairs.

52:17.612 --> 52:20.180
[typing]

52:23.357 --> 52:25.359
Good luck,
Jay Dipersia.

52:27.492 --> 52:29.711
Maia Rindell!

52:29.842 --> 52:31.452
Where are you?

52:31.583 --> 52:33.237
You mousy little viper.

52:33.367 --> 52:35.195
MARISSA:All right, sir, I'm
gonna need you to...

52:35.326 --> 52:37.893
Ah, you got an office!

52:38.024 --> 52:40.809
You fucking
backstabbing bitch!

52:40.940 --> 52:44.900
You fucked over my client
and you violated my trust.

52:45.031 --> 52:46.815
Have you no decency?!

52:46.946 --> 52:48.730
[scoffs]
Are you serious?

52:48.861 --> 52:50.254
You do this after

52:50.384 --> 52:52.821
the love I showed you?!

52:52.952 --> 52:55.128
[yelling]

52:57.304 --> 52:58.740
[growls]

52:58.871 --> 53:02.004
See, is that
supposed to scare me?

53:03.571 --> 53:05.791
Am I supposed to beg
your forgiveness?

53:05.921 --> 53:08.576
No, I beat you
at your own game,

53:08.707 --> 53:10.665
and it wasn't
difficult because

53:10.796 --> 53:14.147
you were stoned and sloppy
and you left me an opening.

53:14.278 --> 53:15.670
I don't need

53:15.801 --> 53:20.675
the "love" of a, of a
sick, washed-up fuck

53:20.806 --> 53:24.070
who's pretending that he can
cut it when he fucking can't!

[onlookers murmuring]

53:26.507 --> 53:28.640
[panting]

53:31.860 --> 53:34.123

[thunder rumbling]

53:45.831 --> 53:48.399
The fuck are you looking at?

53:56.885 --> 53:59.018
I have news
on Valerie Peyser.

53:59.148 --> 54:00.802
That was fast.

54:00.933 --> 54:03.588
Where did you find her?

54:04.850 --> 54:06.982
In New York.
Good.

54:07.113 --> 54:10.290
She said she was going there
to confer with Obama's people.

54:10.421 --> 54:12.074
When will she be back?

54:12.205 --> 54:14.599
Not for a while.

54:14.729 --> 54:17.297
But she's alive?Yes.

54:19.299 --> 54:21.562
Do you, uh, have
her contact info?

54:21.693 --> 54:23.999
I do.

54:24.130 --> 54:26.524
Did you pay her any money?

54:26.654 --> 54:29.440
Did I... Why?

54:29.570 --> 54:33.182
Valerie Peyser
is a made-up name.

54:33.313 --> 54:34.619
Valerie Underhill

54:34.749 --> 54:36.795
is from Elk Creek,
Wisconsin.

54:36.925 --> 54:38.623
She's currently serving
eight months in Rikers

54:38.753 --> 54:40.842
for bilking
three SoHo hotels.

54:40.973 --> 54:43.541
In 2014, she was arrested
for check-kiting.

54:43.671 --> 54:46.283
In 2016, for
identity theft.

54:47.936 --> 54:49.982
[sighs softly]

54:52.680 --> 54:55.988
She befriends wealthy women,
gains their confidence,

54:56.118 --> 54:57.772
acquires their
credit card numbers,

54:57.903 --> 55:00.166
and uses their identity
to con the next person.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.038
Been doing this for the last
decade, in L.A., Chicago,

55:03.169 --> 55:06.041
Miami and New York.

55:06.172 --> 55:09.306
[whispers]:
Oh, my God.

55:09.436 --> 55:11.699
But there was never
any money involved.

55:11.830 --> 55:13.962
My guess is she would've
asked for the contributions

55:14.093 --> 55:16.095
at the next meeting until
the PAC money arrived.

55:16.225 --> 55:19.272
Luckily for you, she returned
to New York to gather her things

55:19.403 --> 55:21.927
from the W Hotel
and was arrested.

55:24.930 --> 55:27.106
Oh, my God.

55:27.236 --> 55:28.760
Here's her
arrest record

55:28.890 --> 55:32.590
and my interview with
the New York detective.

55:32.720 --> 55:36.071
Do you want me to go with you
to brief them?

55:36.202 --> 55:38.073
Them?

55:39.640 --> 55:41.860
Oh.

55:41.990 --> 55:43.992
No, um, I will.
