Hurry, Lady!

00:49.330 --> 00:51.276
Oh, it's happening again.

00:51.332 --> 00:53.278
That's right, Finn.

00:53.334 --> 00:54.438
Princess!

00:54.501 --> 00:56.344
The zombie infection has spread

00:56.403 --> 00:58.383
across the kingdom once again.

00:58.439 --> 01:02.046
And once again,
it's all my fault.

01:02.109 --> 01:04.953
I was testing a sample of the
zombie flesh I had saved

01:05.012 --> 01:07.515
when Cinnamon Bun
came into the lab.

01:07.581 --> 01:09.561
He said he was hungry.

01:09.617 --> 01:11.221
I'm hungry-

01:11.285 --> 01:13.925
Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy.

01:13.988 --> 01:16.195
And that's when I
made my mistake.

01:16.257 --> 01:19.170
I should have paid more
attention to that poor fool.

01:19.226 --> 01:20.226
Huh?

01:21.295 --> 01:22.706
Mmm!

01:26.200 --> 01:28.146
The candy-zombie
flesh he ingested

01:28.202 --> 01:30.341
was highly contagious.

01:36.343 --> 01:37.788
Cinnamon Bun?

01:37.845 --> 01:40.257
Where did you... eeek!

01:40.314 --> 01:42.624
Sugar!

01:42.683 --> 01:45.823
I escaped, but I wasn't
able to stop Cinnamon Bun

01:45.886 --> 01:48.389
from infecting the
rest of the kingdom.

01:48.455 --> 01:50.901
The good news is I still
have all my notes

01:50.958 --> 01:52.904
for making the antidote formula.

01:52.960 --> 01:53.961
Oh, sweet!

01:54.028 --> 01:55.473
Let's board up the windows,

01:55.529 --> 01:57.065
then we can get started.

01:57.131 --> 01:59.509
Owww! Aaaah!

01:59.566 --> 02:00.840
Princess!

02:00.901 --> 02:02.380
Don't worry, Finn.

02:02.436 --> 02:04.177
You have the notes
for my formula.

02:04.238 --> 02:06.718
Just let Science do the work.

02:06.774 --> 02:08.878
Science... is...

02:08.943 --> 02:12.914
mmmmoraaaah!

02:12.980 --> 02:14.323
Noooo!

02:14.381 --> 02:15.860
Get that zombie out of here!

02:17.818 --> 02:18.888
Oh, no.

02:18.953 --> 02:21.900
I am not getting eaten
by zombies tonight.

02:24.325 --> 02:27.932
Get the lump out of here!

02:27.995 --> 02:29.372
Oh, Princess!

02:29.430 --> 02:31.034
These notes make no sense.

02:31.098 --> 02:32.702
It's all gobbledy gak.

02:32.766 --> 02:35.337
We'll each make our own
version of the formula.

02:35.402 --> 02:37.882
One of us is bound
to get it right.

02:50.918 --> 02:53.057
Hmm?

02:53.120 --> 02:55.691
Hey, Princess Bubblegulm
trained her rat to dance.

02:55.756 --> 02:57.258
Neat!

03:10.337 --> 03:12.180
Ah! All right!

03:12.239 --> 03:15.049
Ahh. Oh, yes!

03:16.176 --> 03:17.917
Done!

03:17.978 --> 03:19.082
Done!

03:19.146 --> 03:20.090
Done!

03:20.147 --> 03:24.061
Bubblegum, I'm coming for you!

03:29.089 --> 03:30.898
Mine first.

03:39.666 --> 03:42.237
Aah!

03:48.876 --> 03:49.980
Rarr!

03:50.044 --> 03:52.046
Sugar!

03:57.518 --> 03:59.520
Cram!

04:01.088 --> 04:02.192
Oh, my!

04:02.256 --> 04:04.202
That's a lot of
zombies down there.

04:04.258 --> 04:06.295
Starchy's glad he's up here,

04:06.360 --> 04:08.033
♪ Doot do-do-doo ♪

04:08.095 --> 04:11.804
Aah! Daaaaaaang itttttttttt!

04:11.865 --> 04:14.607
- Aah!
- Let's get out of here!

04:14.668 --> 04:15.840
Upstairs!

04:19.005 --> 04:20.781
Jake, try yours and Lady's next.

04:20.841 --> 04:22.115
Move out of the way!

04:22.176 --> 04:24.247
My formula is going
to cure the zombies

04:24.311 --> 04:28.054
because I made the
prettiest formula.

04:30.317 --> 04:31.523
Aah!

04:34.588 --> 04:36.727
Ohm my... glob!

04:36.790 --> 04:38.633
Look at those luscious lips!

04:38.692 --> 04:40.831
I got to go lick up the
rest of that formula.

04:40.894 --> 04:42.601
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

04:42.663 --> 04:44.006
My formula!

04:47.067 --> 04:50.446
Formula! Oh, my glob! Yes!

04:50.504 --> 04:52.108
I'm gonna be so hot!

04:52.172 --> 04:54.812
So freaking hot!

04:54.875 --> 04:57.651
Yeah!

04:57.711 --> 04:59.190
LSP, look out!

04:59.246 --> 05:00.520
Huh?

05:00.581 --> 05:03.494
I know you want this body,
but you can't have it!

05:03.550 --> 05:05.154
You can't have it!

05:07.721 --> 05:09.394
Oww!

05:13.494 --> 05:15.405
Aah! LSP!

05:15.462 --> 05:16.532
Dang it, Jake.

05:16.597 --> 05:17.940
We only got one formula left.

05:17.998 --> 05:19.272
Try yours and Lady's.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.676
Right.

05:20.734 --> 05:23.908
Let's hope this works.

05:33.447 --> 05:37.520
Aah!

05:37.584 --> 05:39.154
Whe... where now?

05:39.219 --> 05:41.199
We can barricade
ourselves in the lab.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.873
Did anyone get bit?

05:48.929 --> 05:50.374
I think we're good.

05:50.430 --> 05:53.968
That door's made out
of candy steel.

05:54.034 --> 05:56.640
- Aaah!
- What's the matter?

06:02.776 --> 06:06.087
Jake! Did he get you?

06:06.146 --> 06:09.650
I think I'm okay. It's
just a little bite.

06:09.716 --> 06:11.127
Uh...

06:11.185 --> 06:13.256
Aah!

06:17.357 --> 06:19.303
- Jake!
- It's all good, sweetie.

06:19.359 --> 06:21.032
I can stretch forever.

06:22.596 --> 06:26.134
Hey, let's hurry up with
that antidote, huh, pal?

06:27.701 --> 06:30.181
Oooooooooooohhhhhhh.

06:30.237 --> 06:32.080
Okay, let's see here.

06:32.139 --> 06:35.018
Nyah, nyah, nyah.

06:35.075 --> 06:37.749
Try one of them books
over by the lab rat.

06:37.811 --> 06:39.722
Ha! Yeah, okay!

06:39.780 --> 06:40.724
Yes!

06:40.781 --> 06:42.590
This book is a
glossary of symbols.

06:42.649 --> 06:45.425
That's great, buddy.

06:49.523 --> 06:52.766
Jake, I think this little guy's
got serious dance fever.

07:01.735 --> 07:03.146
Don't come near me, sweetie.

07:04.638 --> 07:05.742
Oh, man. I'm out of shape.

07:05.806 --> 07:07.410
I think I should
just stay in here.

07:07.474 --> 07:09.215
You know... just in case.

07:09.276 --> 07:11.278
Uh-oh!

07:14.615 --> 07:16.561
Hurry, dude! - I am!

07:16.617 --> 07:18.563
Okay, Jake's probably
gonna turn into a zombie,

07:18.619 --> 07:19.996
which is okay.

07:20.053 --> 07:21.964
I just have to figure
out this formula.

07:22.022 --> 07:24.024
Jake?

07:25.192 --> 07:26.262
Jake?

07:30.564 --> 07:31.599
Jake!

07:31.665 --> 07:34.271
Hang on, Lady. I'll
have the antidote soon.

07:34.334 --> 07:36.314
But whatever you do,
just don't let him out.

07:36.370 --> 07:38.316
He might look like the
Jake that once loved you,

07:38.372 --> 07:40.682
but he's just a zombie.

07:54.187 --> 07:55.632
Hey, Lady.

07:55.689 --> 07:56.963
Aah!

08:28.055 --> 08:29.056
The book!

08:34.660 --> 08:36.197
Sorry, everybody.

08:36.263 --> 08:39.607
Sorry, LSP, P.B., Jake,

08:39.666 --> 08:43.044
L.R., Peepee, Poopoo, Doodoo.

08:44.538 --> 08:46.381
You know, it's funny.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.818
I don't even know your name.

08:49.843 --> 08:50.753
Yeah?

08:50.811 --> 08:51.846
What is it, girl?

08:51.912 --> 08:53.858
Sci... ence?

08:53.914 --> 08:55.689
Your name is Science?

08:55.749 --> 08:57.524
Could it be?

08:57.584 --> 09:00.190
Just let Science do the work.

09:00.253 --> 09:02.130
Science... is...

09:02.189 --> 09:07.002
mmmmoraaaah!

09:07.060 --> 09:09.370
Hmm.

09:36.423 --> 09:37.458
Is that it'?

09:40.627 --> 09:42.766
Here goes nothing.

09:46.032 --> 09:46.942
Finn!

09:47.000 --> 09:47.944
Jake!

09:48.001 --> 09:49.207
You did it!

09:49.269 --> 09:50.805
I... huh? Uh-oh.

09:50.871 --> 09:52.282
Aaah!

10:04.117 --> 10:06.927
Don't worry, Science. I've
got a disgusting idea.

10:11.958 --> 10:14.199
Oh, my glob!

10:19.032 --> 10:20.807
I'm sorry about the
whole biting thing.

10:20.867 --> 10:22.278
No, you weren't yourself.

10:22.335 --> 10:24.781
It was really nothing personal.

10:26.306 --> 10:27.808
Sorry about biting you, sugar.

10:32.846 --> 10:34.086
Oh!

10:34.147 --> 10:36.753
And so the royal
day of apologizing

10:36.817 --> 10:39.821
has come to an end.

10:41.855 --> 10:45.325
And now I shall present
the royal medal

10:45.392 --> 10:47.338
for heroic bravery.

10:47.394 --> 10:50.000
Finn the human! - Yes?

10:50.063 --> 10:53.567
Would you please
move out of the way?

10:53.633 --> 10:55.909
Science the rat,

10:55.969 --> 10:59.212
you have served
your kingdom well.

10:59.272 --> 11:03.721
Citizens of Candy
Kingdom, rejoice!

11:05.512 --> 11:06.786
Rejoice!

11:08.248 --> 11:09.522
Rejoice!
