12:14.024 --> 12:16.110
No, you don't. You have no clue.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.611
And this is A Capella.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.281
-It me.
-That's your superpower? You can sing?

12:20.364 --> 12:22.658
Yep, but I have an unusual range.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.619
I can go low… [sings very low]

12:25.703 --> 12:29.457
or I can go high! [sings very high]

12:29.540 --> 12:31.292
I can even go really…

12:31.375 --> 12:32.293

12:32.918 --> 12:34.211
I don't hear anything.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.088
It's beyond human hearing.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.089

12:37.173 --> 12:38.841
[Granada] Miss A Capella Vox,

12:38.924 --> 12:41.135
please refrain from using your high voice.

12:41.218 --> 12:45.181
Every dog in the neighborhood
has surrounded our building.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.849
[laughter]

12:46.932 --> 12:50.186
And she can sing so low
that she moves objects.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.229
Show her how you make things float!

12:53.272 --> 12:54.690
[sings very low]

13:11.540 --> 13:12.708

13:27.097 --> 13:29.725
All righty, let's see who's left.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.228
That's Blinding Fast's kid, Slo-Mo.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.650
[Wheels] He's actually moving very fast,

13:37.733 --> 13:40.528
but somehow,
his powers have him stuck in a time warp.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.072
[slowly] Hi.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.991
That kid over there…

13:46.575 --> 13:48.786
Two packs of candy for crossing our eyes.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.037
…is Facemaker.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.580
Okay.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.668
Beat that.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.003
He makes the craziest faces.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.468
It's impossible!

14:04.552 --> 14:07.096
I can even change my face
to look like you.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.682
[crunching]

14:10.683 --> 14:13.143
He's cheating! I can't compete with that!

14:15.771 --> 14:17.106
Oh, dude!

14:17.606 --> 14:19.483
Rewind, clean up on aisle two.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.821
That's Rewind.
He can rewind time but just a few seconds.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.156
[winding back]

14:32.329 --> 14:33.789
[Facemaker screams]

14:38.210 --> 14:40.337
They're twins. It's crazy, right?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.965
What twins? What are you talking about?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.634
Fast Forward, are you at it again?

14:45.718 --> 14:49.346
You were taking so long, I skipped you
forward a bit. Sorry, not sorry.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.223
She and Rewind are twins.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.683
Opposite powers.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.769
The only thing they agree on
is they don't like each other.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.229
-At all.
-At all.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.315
They're twins. It's crazy, right?

15:00.524 --> 15:02.943
And then,
there's our fearless leader, Wild Card.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.196
There's not a power
in the world he doesn't have.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.656
True.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.992
Sure, he has every power imaginable,

15:10.075 --> 15:13.579
but since he can't focus his energy,
they show up randomly.

15:13.662 --> 15:14.622
Also true…

15:15.122 --> 15:16.624
until now that is.

Guppy.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.846
How are you making that?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.807
My mommy is Lavagirl,
but my daddy is Sharkboy.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.727
So instead of lava, I move water.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.063
[sizzling]

15:39.146 --> 15:42.107
I need hydration for my powers to work.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.831
-[Missy] That's really cool.
-[giggling] Thanks.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.960
So, new girl, what's your superpower?

16:01.043 --> 16:04.129
Yeah, uh, so with the whole powers thing--

16:04.213 --> 16:05.297
Wait a second.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.674
I remember you.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.425
You're Marcus Moreno's kid.

16:08.509 --> 16:11.178
Yeah, my dad hasn't gone
on any missions for a while,

16:11.261 --> 16:14.556
so I've been chilling
with the normal kids.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.227
Why would they put a kid with superpowers
in with normal kids?

16:18.852 --> 16:20.270
Oh, I get it.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.065
You don't have any powers.

16:23.983 --> 16:24.984
You're powerless?

16:25.567 --> 16:27.695
Whatever. Can we put on the TV?

16:28.362 --> 16:31.198
[sighs] I want to see
if there's news about our parents.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.241
[beeps]

16:33.325 --> 16:37.705
You know this is
an epic Heroic smackdown event

16:37.788 --> 16:39.915
when they've called in Sharkboy!

16:39.999 --> 16:41.208
-[cheering]
-Yeah!

16:42.292 --> 16:45.796
[male anchor] Earlier today,
Sharkboy appeared from the ocean depths,

16:45.879 --> 16:48.924
landing on the beach
of South Padre Island.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.260
And moments later, Lavagirl

16:51.343 --> 16:54.555
blasted up from inside an active volcano.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.099
Go Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

16:57.182 --> 16:59.268
[female anchor]
She's from the Earth's core.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.103
And here's Mayor Doolittle

17:01.186 --> 17:04.356
at today's ribbon cutting
for his new city hall,

17:04.440 --> 17:07.943
rebuilt after the last time
the Heroics went into action.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.571

-[gasping]

17:10.654 --> 17:11.697
Did you see that?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.449
Of course you didn't.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.326
That means
it's none other than Blinding Fast,

17:16.410 --> 17:18.829
the fastest Heroic on the planet.

17:18.912 --> 17:22.416
[slowly] Go, Dad!

17:22.499 --> 17:24.626

17:24.710 --> 17:26.628
[screaming on TV]

17:27.463 --> 17:30.841
And there goes the mayor's new building
in record time.

17:30.924 --> 17:34.386
These battles are insanely expensive
for taxpayers,

17:34.470 --> 17:36.597
but so entertaining.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.099
Pass the popcorn.
This battle's gonna be epic!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.686
[female anchor] This is unprecedented.

17:42.770 --> 17:47.316
All of the Heroics have been called
into action against the alien threat.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.488
We're getting some live footage now.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.573
And look who's back in action.

17:54.656 --> 17:55.949
It's Miracle Guy.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.203
You didn't expect him
to actually lose, did you?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.581
[smoldering]

18:06.251 --> 18:09.379

18:14.927 --> 18:16.553

18:31.652 --> 18:33.028
Oh my God!

18:33.112 --> 18:35.697
No way!
No one's ever taken down Miracle Guy!

Oh no.
I'm just getting some terrible news.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.784
It's almost unimaginable,
but two of our heroes

19:20.868 --> 19:23.287
have been captured by the intruders.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.831
I thought the Heroics were unbeatable.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.416
They are unbeatable.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.542
It's not over yet.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.004
It looks like our heroes are fighting
amongst themselves again.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.801

-I don't need your dated chivalry.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.326
I want to see it again.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.161
And I don't want to see it again.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.663
[female anchor]
And here comes Mrs. Vox to the rescue.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.957
She'll get those aliens
singing a different tune.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.584
[Mrs. Vox sings]

20:14.713 --> 20:16.340

Dad, we had a deal.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.244
I know.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.163
I promised I wouldn't be a hero anymore.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.377
But I'm still the leader of the Heroics.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.422

22:08.452 --> 22:10.412
[somber music plays]

22:14.124 --> 22:18.295
We're getting word that the president
would like to address the nation.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.255
People of America,

22:20.339 --> 22:21.673
as you have witnessed,

22:22.174 --> 22:24.343
the Heroics have been captured.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.636
Military forces are stepping in,

22:26.720 --> 22:29.264
mobilizing to bring our heroes back.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.184
But while it looks rather hopeless…

22:32.809 --> 22:33.810
it's bad, it--

22:34.770 --> 22:35.937
It's hopelessly bad.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.190
How did this guy get to be president?

22:38.273 --> 22:40.359
He can't even put two sentences together.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.362
We have just received a message

22:43.445 --> 22:46.198
from the supreme commander of the aliens

22:46.281 --> 22:47.991
that has been decoded.

22:48.492 --> 22:52.079
It reads, "We are from the planet Ogima.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.664
Unfortunately, we have no choice

22:54.748 --> 22:56.458
but to prepare you for…

22:57.167 --> 22:58.168
takeover.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.461
Please comply,

23:00.087 --> 23:02.381
or else Earth will be destroyed.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.092
You have three hours."

23:05.842 --> 23:07.844
I'm afraid that was the entire message.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.430
There are no heroes left.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.392
God save us all.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.024
Children, for your own safety,

23:21.108 --> 23:23.193
we're going into full lockdown.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.362
No one leave your seats.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.324
As long as you stay where you are,
you are all safe.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.371
Yeah, right. They can't protect us
from that. We just saw it.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.664
You got a better idea?

23:35.747 --> 23:38.875
We should probably do
what Miss Granada says.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.710
Uh, pardon me, but--

23:40.794 --> 23:43.463
The last look on my dad's face
will haunt me forever.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.009
-What do they want from us?
-Do you think our parents are okay?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.345
-Uh, excuse me?
-What?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.722
We need to leave this room right now.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.182
Why?

23:54.266 --> 23:58.770
Because the aliens know where we are,
and they're coming for us next.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.566
[scoffs] How could you possibly know that?

24:06.611 --> 24:07.821
Can I borrow this a minute?

24:10.115 --> 24:11.074
Ojo drew these.

of the floating chairs,

24:16.621 --> 24:18.415
She draws what she sees, big deal.

24:18.498 --> 24:22.377
She drew these things five minutes
before they happened.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.380
Ojo's superpower isn't that she can draw,

24:25.464 --> 24:26.840
she can draw the future.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.341
[Wild Card] Okay, cool.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.594
Good for Ojo. What's your point?

24:30.677 --> 24:35.015
She also drew these alien creatures
breaking into this very room.

24:35.599 --> 24:36.558
There.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.144
[Noodle] Whoa!

24:39.227 --> 24:41.271
You're saying they'll come through there?

24:41.354 --> 24:44.441
She's right. All these drawings
suddenly make perfect sense.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.485
Ojo can see the future.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.153
Let me get this straight.

24:48.236 --> 24:51.865
Some new girl shows up
with absolutely zero powers,

24:51.948 --> 24:54.367
and suddenly
we're gonna do what she says?

24:54.451 --> 24:55.994
Seems like she's got a point.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.705
A moment ago, you agreed
that we weren't safe here.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.709
We're safer in here than running around
outside with you playing captain.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.753

Does anybody else hear that?

51:43.266 --> 51:44.309
What is that?

51:45.018 --> 51:46.353
It's below us.

51:51.817 --> 51:52.901
I can feel it.

51:53.693 --> 51:55.403
[rattling]

51:56.363 --> 51:57.739
[revving]

52:00.367 --> 52:01.368
[Wild Card] Uh!

52:06.915 --> 52:08.250
[screaming]

52:10.377 --> 52:11.336
[screaming]

52:18.677 --> 52:19.803
[chittering]

52:22.097 --> 52:23.348
[Facemaker] Which way?

52:25.183 --> 52:26.226
That way!

52:31.064 --> 52:33.066
-[snarling]
-[screaming]

52:33.150 --> 52:35.777
[vocalizes]

52:47.038 --> 52:48.206
Look at that thing.

52:51.668 --> 52:52.961
[door opening]

52:58.550 --> 53:00.760
What the heck
is the president doing here?

53:02.971 --> 53:05.640
So they're inside this thing?
All of them?

53:06.224 --> 53:09.603
-[man] That's correct.
-How long before the takeover begins?

53:10.187 --> 53:13.273
According to the supreme commander,
less than an hour.

53:13.356 --> 53:14.399
[president] So soon?

53:14.482 --> 53:16.985
[man] That's what she says,
and she's never wrong.

53:17.068 --> 53:18.612
You don't have to remind me.

53:19.279 --> 53:21.239
Ever wonder why we bother with all this

53:21.323 --> 53:23.825
when she already knows
how it's gonna turn out?

53:23.909 --> 53:26.119
All part of the process, I suppose.

53:30.040 --> 53:30.999
What is that thing?

53:31.583 --> 53:34.961
You heard him. It's a rocket
stuffed to the gills with aliens.

53:35.045 --> 53:38.798
In less than an hour, they'll send it
down to Earth and start the takeover.

53:39.591 --> 53:42.344
Well, then we have to stop them. Let's go.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.225
Do you children have any idea
what you've done?

53:48.808 --> 53:50.352
Stealing one of our trains?

53:50.435 --> 53:52.312
Turning headquarters upside down?

53:52.938 --> 53:55.857
Flying an alien shuttle
into outer space. Hmm?

53:58.360 --> 54:00.195
[squeals] Well done!

54:01.988 --> 54:04.741
Looks like
we underestimated your abilities

54:04.824 --> 54:06.493
and your leadership qualities.

54:06.576 --> 54:09.537
You took a huge risk,
but it was the right risk.

54:09.621 --> 54:12.540
Headquarters was attacked
just minutes after you escaped.

54:12.624 --> 54:15.919
If you hadn't broken out,
you would have all been captured.

54:16.002 --> 54:19.673
And now you've managed to lead us
into the heart of this alien mother ship?

54:19.756 --> 54:21.383
[gasps] Mm.

54:22.384 --> 54:23.551
So proud!

54:23.635 --> 54:26.388
Wait, so we're not in trouble?

54:26.471 --> 54:28.014
Of course not.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.808
You are heroes.

54:30.433 --> 54:31.768
-Yeah!
-[cheering]

54:32.352 --> 54:33.770
Yes! [chuckles]

54:33.853 --> 54:34.980
[Wheels] Missy!

54:35.522 --> 54:37.774
Her vital signs are all over the place.

54:43.947 --> 54:45.323
Save your breath, Granada.

54:46.241 --> 54:47.284
They know.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.329
Uh-oh!

54:51.413 --> 54:52.914
[slithering sound]

54:55.583 --> 54:56.710
Hmm…

54:56.793 --> 54:58.628
Well, then… round them up!

54:59.796 --> 55:01.214
[kids grunt]

55:08.388 --> 55:09.973
[chittering]

55:11.308 --> 55:12.434
[Facemaker] Watch it!

55:23.236 --> 55:24.321
[grunts]

55:26.614 --> 55:28.366
Quit the pantomime, Slo-Mo.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.493
-You didn't even scrape a knee.
-Mm-hmm.

55:30.577 --> 55:31.870
[Granada] Oh, good.

55:31.953 --> 55:35.707
Just the kind of divisive attitude
I've been counting on.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.544
You kids are just like your parents.

55:39.627 --> 55:40.670
The same in-fighting.

55:41.629 --> 55:42.964
The same bickering.

55:43.923 --> 55:46.843
Putting your own egos ahead of your team.

55:47.510 --> 55:49.429
-Take away her water.
-[gasps]

55:50.221 --> 55:51.389
[gasps]

55:54.100 --> 55:55.602
They're too powerful together.

56:01.149 --> 56:02.942
Oh, don't worry.

56:03.026 --> 56:05.487
I won't take away your little toy.

56:05.570 --> 56:08.114
I already know what your future is.

56:09.657 --> 56:11.284
Imprisonment.

56:12.369 --> 56:13.828
Life long.

56:16.164 --> 56:17.123
Hmm.

56:18.875 --> 56:19.876
[chuckles]

56:23.171 --> 56:24.214
[beeping]

56:26.758 --> 56:28.510
[clunking]

56:30.261 --> 56:32.180
How are we getting out of here?

56:37.560 --> 56:38.603
I…

56:40.230 --> 56:41.272
don't know.

56:43.149 --> 56:44.150
[sighs]

56:44.901 --> 56:47.070
What do you mean you don't know?

56:47.862 --> 56:48.863
I mean…

56:49.572 --> 56:50.824
[sighs] I don't know.

56:51.741 --> 56:53.618
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

56:53.701 --> 56:54.786
Enough thinking.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.372
I'm gonna punch my way out of here.

56:59.457 --> 57:01.334
I have to save my son.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.503
[grunting]

57:04.629 --> 57:05.713
That's not gonna work.

57:06.631 --> 57:08.133
How do you know?

57:08.216 --> 57:11.886
While you were blinking your eyes,
I went around and tried everything.

57:11.970 --> 57:13.012
[mocks]

57:16.474 --> 57:18.601
Uh, you were saying?

57:22.689 --> 57:23.731
[snarling]

57:26.443 --> 57:28.486
What are you? An alien spy?

57:29.446 --> 57:31.197
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

57:31.281 --> 57:32.991
I just want to see what it is.

57:33.074 --> 57:35.285
Don't worry.
It won't even know I touched it.

57:38.163 --> 57:39.414
[snarls]

57:40.331 --> 57:41.249
[snarls]

57:41.332 --> 57:42.208
[grunts]

57:43.209 --> 57:44.419
[hisses]

57:44.878 --> 57:45.837
[snarls]

57:49.132 --> 57:50.884
[snarls]

57:51.342 --> 57:53.094
A-ha!

57:53.178 --> 57:54.554
Anita Moreno?

57:54.637 --> 57:55.555
Hmm!

57:56.389 --> 57:57.390
Hi, Mom.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.809
No, no, no, don't "Hi, Mom" me.

57:59.893 --> 58:02.187
-[exhales sharply]
-That was pathetic.

58:02.854 --> 58:06.983
You stop training for a year
and look what happens. Eh?

58:07.066 --> 58:08.902
You… dropped your guard.

58:08.985 --> 58:12.155
And you…
attacked when you should have blocked.

58:12.238 --> 58:17.327
And you rushed
when you should've calculated. Eh?

58:17.410 --> 58:21.789
I hope your kids
paid more attention to me than you did.

58:22.665 --> 58:23.666
Thanks, Mom.

58:28.004 --> 58:30.798
I bet Miss Granada's
been working there for years.

58:31.382 --> 58:35.220
They must have hacked the elections
and put their own alien in as president

58:35.303 --> 58:37.514
so they could set a trap for the Heroics.

58:38.348 --> 58:39.807
I'm such an idiot.

58:41.601 --> 58:43.228
President Neil Anami.

58:43.853 --> 58:45.939
Spell Neil Anami backwards and you have…

58:46.731 --> 58:49.067
"I'm an alien."

58:50.026 --> 58:53.154
Everyone thinks that the aliens
only invaded this morning,

58:53.738 --> 58:55.823
but they've been here for years,

58:55.907 --> 58:58.117
planning this takeover the whole time.

58:58.201 --> 59:00.537
And now we're locked in this stupid cell

59:00.620 --> 59:01.955
with no way out.

59:02.664 --> 59:03.706
You're welcome.

59:04.207 --> 59:05.083
Any luck?

59:05.166 --> 59:06.251
[grunting]

59:08.044 --> 59:09.003
[groans]

59:09.504 --> 59:12.924
I need water.
Without water, I can't use my powers.

59:13.883 --> 59:16.594
I need food. My stomach hurts.

59:17.178 --> 59:19.764
-My arm hurts.
-My ears hurt!

59:20.390 --> 59:22.850
We never should have come.
You led us here.

59:22.934 --> 59:25.562
You think I wanted to get locked up
in an alien ship?

59:25.645 --> 59:26.896
It was all of us.

59:28.565 --> 59:29.816
We did it together.

59:29.899 --> 59:31.192
I wanna go home.

59:31.693 --> 59:33.069
[Twins in unison] Me too!

59:33.152 --> 59:34.445
We all want to go home.

59:34.529 --> 59:37.031
The key is figuring out
how to get out of this room

59:37.115 --> 59:39.534
so we can make sure
there's a home to go back to.

59:39.617 --> 59:40.618
Wait a second.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.162
What did you just say?

59:43.246 --> 59:46.416
-He said we all want to go home.
-Not that, the second part.

59:46.499 --> 59:48.251
"Figure out how to get out of this room

59:48.334 --> 59:50.378
so we can make sure
there's a home to go back to"?

59:50.461 --> 59:52.088
Stop saying that.

59:52.171 --> 59:53.548
Keep it together.

59:54.549 --> 59:55.717
Guys…

59:56.968 --> 1:00:00.054
maybe it's time to admit
we're never getting out of here.

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:02.932
-What?
-I mean, let's get real.

1:00:03.016 --> 1:00:06.352
These walls and this door
must be, like, two-feet thick.

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:08.187
It's totally impossible.

1:00:08.271 --> 1:00:10.982
-Wow, great attitude.
-[Missy] Yep.

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:13.568
We're never getting out of here,

1:00:13.651 --> 1:00:17.030
and we're certainly never seeing
our parents again, that's for sure.

1:00:19.907 --> 1:00:23.578
She's right. Pretty soon
we'll forget what they even look like.

1:00:24.162 --> 1:00:25.288
The way they smelled…

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:27.624
It'll all just be…

1:00:27.707 --> 1:00:29.000
gone.

1:00:29.584 --> 1:00:32.253
Jeez, you guys are really bumming me out.

1:00:34.005 --> 1:00:35.298
But I guess…

1:00:35.882 --> 1:00:38.926
this really is the end.

1:00:39.802 --> 1:00:42.221
-But I'm not ready for the end.
-[sniffles]

1:00:42.305 --> 1:00:44.015
I was just starting to think…

1:00:44.599 --> 1:00:46.351
maybe my sister didn't hate me.

1:00:47.018 --> 1:00:48.144
I don't hate you.

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:50.063
[both] I love you.

1:00:50.605 --> 1:00:51.981
That love we feel…

1:00:52.065 --> 1:00:53.232
is real.

1:00:54.525 --> 1:00:55.360
And…

1:00:55.860 --> 1:00:57.153
it's that love…

1:00:58.363 --> 1:00:59.697
that'll get us out of here.

1:00:59.781 --> 1:01:03.785
Why are guys saying all this stuff?
It's almost like you want everyone to cry…

1:01:04.494 --> 1:01:06.245
Oh!

1:01:06.329 --> 1:01:08.373
Guppy, quick, gather all the tears.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:28.601
What are you making?

1:01:28.685 --> 1:01:30.103
I'm making a key.

1:01:35.066 --> 1:01:36.150
Little Miss Guppy,

1:01:36.901 --> 1:01:38.236
you just saved us.

1:01:41.364 --> 1:01:42.782
[lock opens]

1:01:44.659 --> 1:01:46.160
[Missy] Come on, let's go!

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:51.207
[clunking]

1:01:52.917 --> 1:01:53.835
[sighs]

1:01:53.918 --> 1:01:55.670
How long has it been this bad?

1:01:56.337 --> 1:01:57.964
-You should've come to me.
-You?

1:01:58.047 --> 1:01:59.215
-Yup.
-Hmm!

1:02:00.591 --> 1:02:03.720
Don't you remember what your generation
was like when we took over?

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:04.887
-Good point.
-Mm-hmm.

1:02:05.513 --> 1:02:08.182
Well, I guess it's up to the kids.

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:10.977
The next generation is always more…

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:12.895
powerful, more…

1:02:13.604 --> 1:02:14.564
Evolved?

1:02:16.441 --> 1:02:17.442
I got it!

1:02:18.860 --> 1:02:20.903
What? You figure a way out of here?

1:02:21.779 --> 1:02:25.074
Oh… no. I figured out how to switch on
these security monitors.

1:02:27.076 --> 1:02:28.286
Surprisingly intuitive.

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:29.579
What?

1:02:29.662 --> 1:02:31.414
At least now we can watch something

1:02:31.497 --> 1:02:33.875
instead of sitting around
yelling at each other.

1:02:36.419 --> 1:02:37.795
Wait, what's this?

1:02:38.921 --> 1:02:39.922
A Capella?

1:02:40.006 --> 1:02:41.340
-Rewind?
-Fast Forward?

1:02:43.092 --> 1:02:44.302
Are those our children?

1:02:45.344 --> 1:02:47.096
Wheels, how much time do we have?

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:48.264
Eighteen minutes.

1:02:48.347 --> 1:02:50.850
Then we need to hurry
if we want to stop the takeover.

1:02:50.933 --> 1:02:52.852
Us? Are you nuts?

1:02:53.352 --> 1:02:56.022
We have to go free our parents
and let them handle it.

1:02:56.105 --> 1:02:59.192
No! There's no time for that!
By the time we get there, they--

1:02:59.275 --> 1:03:01.486
No! I'm through listening to you.

1:03:01.569 --> 1:03:03.529
When I woke up,
everything was perfect,

1:03:03.613 --> 1:03:05.656
then you come along
and everything's a mess.

1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:08.326
If Little Miss No-Powers
is who you want as a leader,

1:03:08.409 --> 1:03:10.995
fine, follow her straight into Alienville.

1:03:11.078 --> 1:03:13.915
But Facemaker and I
are gonna go get our parents.

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:16.501
-We are?
-Yes. Right now.

1:03:16.584 --> 1:03:19.086
Guys, we have to stick together.

1:03:21.297 --> 1:03:22.298
Guys!

1:03:25.051 --> 1:03:26.135
What can you do?

1:03:26.719 --> 1:03:29.013
-Some people are just--
-[Wheels] Forget him.

1:03:29.096 --> 1:03:32.475
We need to get to the rocket
so I can stop it before it launches.

1:03:32.558 --> 1:03:34.727
How are you so sure you can do that?

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:37.772
Because everything the aliens build
is super intuitive to use,

1:03:37.855 --> 1:03:40.525
almost like it was designed
for children to operate.

1:03:43.110 --> 1:03:45.238
Get me close. I'll turn it off.

1:03:47.281 --> 1:03:49.575
I don't understand. Why did we split up?
