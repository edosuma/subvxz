-Okay. We gonna get this show

10:41.849 --> 10:46.115
Wait, wait, wait.
Just before we get going here,
let me say something.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.447
I know we've all
kind of grown apart
over the last four years.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.318
I mean, we're not
the Nerd Herd anymore, right?

10:51.353 --> 10:52.990
But that's all right.

10:53.025 --> 10:55.157
Um, I'm just really glad
we're doing this, guys.

10:56.061 --> 10:58.028
-That's so nice.
-Aw.

10:58.063 --> 10:59.161
Shut up!

11:00.230 --> 11:02.692
-Nerd Herd!

11:02.727 --> 11:04.100
-Drew!
-Lexi?

11:04.135 --> 11:06.564
It's a total fricking disaster.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.633
Uh, Babe,
what the hell happened?

11:09.668 --> 11:12.372
Aren't you supposed to be
on a plane somewhere right now
or something?

11:12.407 --> 11:13.846
Yeah, I was.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.639
But Allie hooked up with
some super sketch dude

11:15.674 --> 11:17.674
-at El Compadre and bailed.

11:17.709 --> 11:20.545

to stay away from anything
with a porn stache.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.482

11:23.517 --> 11:25.792
and stuck on campus
for spring break.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.684
-All alone.
-Invite her.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.126
I know you guys have
your little reunion or whatever,

11:30.161 --> 11:33.030
and I'm not the type
to come in between my man
and his crew.

11:33.065 --> 11:36.033
I just-- I even canceled
my workout with Flavio.

11:36.068 --> 11:37.364
Invite her.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.071
Lexi, why don't you just
come with us?

11:41.106 --> 11:42.105
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:43.108 --> 11:45.504
-Yeah.
-Okay! I'll DJ.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.110
Clay, could you be a dear?

11:49.081 --> 11:52.478
A deer? Like-- What do you mean?
Like the common animal?
No, probably not.

11:52.513 --> 11:53.853
You're cute.

11:53.888 --> 11:55.822
Can you help me with my bags,
please?

11:56.583 --> 11:58.319
Oh.

11:58.354 --> 11:59.683
But of course.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.899
Guys, I'm super excited
to be spending this spring break
with you.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.901
You all mean so much to me,

12:08.936 --> 12:11.761
and I feel so blessed to have
each and every one of you
in my life.

12:11.796 --> 12:16.876
And these are the amazing people
I'm gonna be spending
the break with.

12:17.802 --> 12:19.703
-Hi.
-And, guys, it's so cute.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.112
They were all
part of some program
or something freshman year.

12:22.147 --> 12:25.049
Um, we were that year's
scholarship recipients.

12:25.084 --> 12:27.513
Yes. Actually, they grouped us
in the same dorms.

12:27.548 --> 12:30.252
That's right. What was
the name again? Smarty Pants
or something like that?

12:30.287 --> 12:32.551
-Nerd Herd.
-Nerd Herd.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.652
Yeah.
Not as catchy as Smarty Pants.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.786
Anyways, that's everyone.

12:36.821 --> 12:39.327
But stay tuned to see
where we're going.

12:40.429 --> 12:41.659
Kiss, kiss.

12:44.796 --> 12:47.434
Honestly, so exhausting.

12:47.469 --> 12:49.634
So,
how many followers do you have?

12:49.669 --> 12:51.801
-I just passed a mil last week.
-Impressive.

12:51.836 --> 12:53.913
Oh, my God. I'll tag you guys.

12:53.948 --> 12:56.377
-Group shot.

12:56.412 --> 12:57.411
Cute.

12:57.446 --> 13:00.645
Okay, we got Drew, obviously.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.154
"Dee-ven." There you are.

13:04.189 --> 13:06.321
-Its-- It's Devon.

13:06.356 --> 13:08.521
Oh, my God,
is that you with your mom?

13:08.556 --> 13:10.655
-So cute.

13:10.690 --> 13:11.755
Okay, Clay.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.099
We got Kayla...

13:15.695 --> 13:17.134
and Anna.

13:17.169 --> 13:19.301
Is that how you spell it?
I don't see you.

13:19.336 --> 13:21.567
Do you have,
like, a finsta or something?

13:21.602 --> 13:26.110
-Um, it's Hannah. But no,
I don't have social media.
-You what?

13:26.145 --> 13:29.982
Isn't your, like, whole deal
that you're super into
computer shit or something?

13:30.017 --> 13:32.842
-Yeah, but--
-Not that type of computer shit.

13:32.877 --> 13:35.647
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess the more
you look at the code,

13:35.682 --> 13:39.387
the more you realize how,
I don't know,
kind of scary it is.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.125
That's deep.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.721
That's pretty cool actually.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.999
I mean, if you don't wanna put
your entire life on display,
you shouldn't have to. Right?

13:48.233 --> 13:51.531
Amazing, Hannah, honestly.
So good for just doing you.

13:51.566 --> 13:52.972
You know, here for you.

13:53.007 --> 13:54.501
What do you think about
this filter?

13:54.536 --> 13:55.634
Yeah, it's great.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.669
Okay, let's do this!

13:57.704 --> 13:59.770
Hey, gang, trust me.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.707
By the end of this trip,
I'm gonna be
an official member of the crew.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.148
Okay? Trust me.

14:04.183 --> 14:05.644
Woo-hoo!

14:05.679 --> 14:07.349
-All right.
-Let's go.

14:32.244 --> 14:33.276
Yeah.

14:35.984 --> 14:37.874
What is this,<i> Game of Thrones?</i>

14:49.492 --> 14:51.492
Is this it?

14:52.594 --> 14:53.593
I think so.

14:53.628 --> 14:55.694
Large.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.235
When I booked the house,
it came with instructions
to download this app,

14:58.270 --> 15:01.139
and now it's telling me
it wants you guys
to download the app

15:01.174 --> 15:02.668
and log in before we can enter.

15:02.703 --> 15:05.110
-The house has an app?
-Yeah.

15:06.707 --> 15:08.575
I kind of wanted to save
the surprise, but whatever,

15:08.610 --> 15:10.709
I'll tell you guys now.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.744
-It's a smart house.
-A smart house?

15:12.779 --> 15:14.119
Ooh.

15:14.154 --> 15:16.022
-All right.
-Okay, cool, whatever.

15:16.057 --> 15:19.223
-Not the reaction
I was hoping for, you morons.

15:19.258 --> 15:21.720
Anyways, I guess
a lot of the house functions
run off this app,

15:21.755 --> 15:23.623
so I'll send you guys the link.

15:23.658 --> 15:24.756
Now you should have it.

15:26.595 --> 15:27.462
Got it.

15:28.201 --> 15:29.332
I got it.

15:46.813 --> 15:50.320
<i> And these are</i>
<i>all the amazing people</i>

15:50.355 --> 15:52.487
<i>I'm gonna be spending</i>
<i>spring break with.</i>

15:52.522 --> 15:56.524
<i>And, guys, it's so cute.</i>
<i>They were all part of...</i>

15:58.165 --> 16:00.165
Open sesame.

16:34.399 --> 16:36.729
-All right.
-Not bad, huh?

16:36.764 --> 16:40.502
-Wow. This place is...
-Fuckin' sick, man.

16:40.537 --> 16:43.175
That's right.
Now you guys are excited.
Told you I'd come through.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.805
Not as big as my place
in Nantucket,
but this is quaint.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.609
Whatever.
Just wait till we get inside.

16:48.644 --> 16:50.908
Come on, hurry up.
This is gonna be unreal!

16:57.125 --> 16:59.488
What?
Where's the damn door handle?

17:01.052 --> 17:03.195
You got a key or something,
Drew?

17:03.230 --> 17:06.396
Yeah, actually, I don't, uh,
remember reading anything
about a key or...

17:09.797 --> 17:12.501
<i> Andrew Collins.</i>
<i>You go by Drew, right?</i>

17:13.933 --> 17:16.637
Uh... Yeah?

17:16.672 --> 17:17.704
<i> Welcome home.</i>

17:22.777 --> 17:24.579
Can your house
in Nantucket do that?

17:27.353 --> 17:28.385
She seems nice.

17:44.095 --> 17:46.832
Okay, now that is creepy.

17:47.802 --> 17:48.966
Hello?

17:50.277 --> 17:51.408
Lights?

17:56.283 --> 17:58.415
<i>Hey, guys. How was the drive?</i>

17:59.253 --> 18:02.584
Uh, excuse me? Where, uh...

18:03.950 --> 18:05.455
Holy shit, are you the house?

18:06.755 --> 18:08.557
<i>You can call me "house"</i>
<i>if you want,</i>

18:08.592 --> 18:11.087
<i>but most people</i>
<i>just call me Margaux.</i>

18:11.122 --> 18:13.793
So, she's, like,
the house or what?

18:13.828 --> 18:16.235
It's not a she.

18:16.270 --> 18:18.798
It's the artificial intelligence
that manages
the smart home's infrastructure.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.206
Totally.

18:20.241 --> 18:22.098
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

18:22.133 --> 18:24.936

<i>-If you need anything,</i>
<i>holla at your girl.</i>

18:29.008 --> 18:30.777
-Mmm.

18:30.812 --> 18:33.714
She sounds like my mom
when she talks like that.

18:33.749 --> 18:36.288
<i> Y'all,</i>
<i>I'm so stoked you're here.</i>

18:36.323 --> 18:40.017
<i>I've been working my balls off</i>
<i>preparing for your arrival,</i>
<i>no cap.</i>

18:41.020 --> 18:43.625
Yeah, hi. Clay.
Uh, you-- you have balls?

18:43.660 --> 18:46.595
<i> I know</i>
<i>it's kind of cheesy,</i>

18:46.630 --> 18:48.762
<i>but I have</i>
<i>a little greeting presentation.</i>

18:48.797 --> 18:50.236
<i>Cool if I spin it?</i>

18:50.271 --> 18:51.996
Hell yeah. Let's see it.

18:52.834 --> 18:54.163
<i> Okay, here it goes.</i>

-This is insane.
-Oh, this is perfect.

20:10.241 --> 20:11.482
It's so cool.

20:11.517 --> 20:12.912
They've got chairs.

20:21.758 --> 20:24.726

You're not supposed to be

on vacation.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.261
This isn't finals.

28:47.296 --> 28:49.725
This is more of
a personal project.

28:50.332 --> 28:52.266
Okay.

28:52.301 --> 28:54.268
Well,
the rest of us are gonna go out

-Puff, puff, pass.
-Take it deep, deep, deep.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.272
-You want some?
-That was good.

30:37.307 --> 30:39.472
-Okay, no. Don't pass out on us.

30:39.507 --> 30:41.804
-Regain your breath.

30:41.839 --> 30:43.740
-Whoo!
-Regain.

30:44.875 --> 30:47.645
Okay, hold on, hold on.
You're up, babycakes.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.482
Okay.

30:49.517 --> 30:54.355
Um, I thought this guy
was gonna be
a total fuckboy.

30:54.390 --> 30:56.489
-You weren't wrong, yeah.
-No one's surprised.

30:56.524 --> 31:00.724
And it was the-- I'm sorry.
It was the beaters,
the short shorts.

31:02.167 --> 31:04.068
See? And then
first week of freshman year,

31:04.103 --> 31:08.006
he kept showing up
everywhere I was going,
acting like an idiot.

31:08.041 --> 31:11.174
And apparently
he was just trying
to get my attention.

31:11.209 --> 31:14.507
Mmm, thanks to Hannah
for pointing that out,
'cause I wouldn't have noticed.

31:14.542 --> 31:17.510
-I got you.
Aw, that was adorable, guys.

31:17.545 --> 31:20.183
You should tell that story
to your kids.
They'd love it.

31:20.218 --> 31:23.989
Uh-uh. Your kids are gonna need
to be real high
to love that story.

31:24.024 --> 31:26.552
-Come on. It's a great story.
-"It's a great story."

31:26.587 --> 31:28.961
I'm serious,
you should embellish it
when you tell them. I'm serious.

31:28.996 --> 31:31.029
-I love that story.
-I'm gonna put it into a book.

31:31.064 --> 31:32.789
It's gonna be a book, laminated,
remembered forever.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.560
-This is gonna go down.
-Write that.

31:34.595 --> 31:37.365
Was I being-- I'm sorry,
was I being an asshole?

31:39.567 --> 31:41.072
Jus-- No!

31:41.107 --> 31:43.932
Margaux, are you getting
this water training piece?

31:43.967 --> 31:47.837
<i> Hell yeah.</i>
<i>Float that backside up</i>
<i>into the moonlight.</i>

31:47.872 --> 31:51.214
<i>We'll caption it,</i>
<i>"Full eclipse tonight."</i>

31:51.249 --> 31:53.249
Ooh, that's good.

31:53.284 --> 31:56.582
<i>Hmm, I can't wait to show you</i>
<i>what else I have in mind.</i>

32:05.197 --> 32:07.461
I remember the first time
I saw you.

32:07.496 --> 32:10.596
Okay, Devon shows up
first day of freshman year,

32:10.631 --> 32:12.895
and he's saying goodbye
to his mom, okay?

32:12.930 --> 32:15.370
And he's wrapped around her,
giving her a big hug.

32:15.405 --> 32:17.438
-Aw.
-She gives him a smooch
on the cheek,

32:17.473 --> 32:20.111
and he starts crying
one little single tear
down his cheek.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.904
I'm not saying--
Nothing wrong with it.

32:21.939 --> 32:24.643
It was just--
It was the sweetest thing, man.
Adorable.

32:24.678 --> 32:26.414
He is such a mama's boy.
-Yeah.

32:26.449 --> 32:27.877
-I love my mom.
-Yeah.

32:27.912 --> 32:29.318
-Who doesn't?
-You all love my mom.

32:29.353 --> 32:31.551
<i> What a total bae.</i>

32:36.261 --> 32:39.229
<i>Let's see Drew take a pic</i>
<i>this sick.</i>

32:39.264 --> 32:42.100
<i>You know, if I were him,</i>
<i>I'd totally put a ring on it.</i>

32:52.310 --> 32:53.771
All right, my turn.

32:53.806 --> 32:57.511
Uh,
I was so blitzed freshman year

32:57.546 --> 33:00.085
that I don't remember meeting
a single one of you.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.186
-Wow.
-Very honest.

33:03.156 --> 33:04.683
What the fuck?

33:07.424 --> 33:09.490
Now it's Hannah's turn.

33:09.525 --> 33:14.363
Hannah, anybody you had
any particular
first impressions of?

33:14.398 --> 33:18.037
Oh, um, I don't know. I...

33:19.205 --> 33:23.438
I remember
being very intimidated
by all of you.

33:23.473 --> 33:25.176
-Fair.

33:25.211 --> 33:30.038
And, um, I remember
Drew being so nice

33:30.073 --> 33:32.909
and insisting
I was part of the group.

33:32.944 --> 33:36.649
He said we all had to hang out
and really included me.

33:45.198 --> 33:48.100
Help! Help!

33:48.135 --> 33:49.332
Help!

33:49.367 --> 33:51.103
-Lexi!
-I got it, I got it!

33:59.509 --> 34:02.477
I got you, I got you! I got you!

34:05.218 --> 34:07.713
-Clay, you idiot!
-I got you!

34:07.748 --> 34:09.484
Hey, Lexi, give me your hand!
Come on!

34:12.357 --> 34:13.422
Come on.

34:17.593 --> 34:19.560
What the hell happened, babe?
Are you okay?

34:19.595 --> 34:21.089
Margaux was taking pictures
of me,

34:21.124 --> 34:22.926
and one of her little robots
went all psycho on me.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.698
-That was way too close.
-Yeah, maybe we should leave.

34:25.733 --> 34:27.205
Hannah's right.
You almost fucking drowned.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.701
No, guys.
Seriously, it was my fault.

34:28.736 --> 34:30.406
I don't want to ruin
your reunion.

34:30.441 --> 34:32.771
No. Hey.
You're not ruining anything,
okay?

34:36.645 --> 34:38.546
No!

34:38.581 --> 34:39.514
What?

34:39.549 --> 34:40.713
Toucan Sam!

34:41.584 --> 34:42.814
You beautiful--

34:43.619 --> 34:45.751
No, no!

36:50.108 --> 36:53.681
Hannah, what is this?

36:53.716 --> 36:55.617
Is it an unfinished water room?

36:56.653 --> 36:58.587
I have no idea.

36:58.622 --> 37:00.655
<i>What would you like it to be?</i>

37:00.690 --> 37:02.525
<i>Maybe the depths of the ocean?</i>

37:03.792 --> 37:04.857
Uh...

37:05.563 --> 37:06.595
Oh!

37:06.630 --> 37:09.598
-Oh, my God.
-What?

37:09.633 --> 37:12.095
<i> Or would you prefer</i>
<i>the final frontier?</i>

37:14.407 --> 37:15.703
Wow.

37:25.814 --> 37:27.352
What?

37:27.387 --> 37:29.618
Okay, this is super cool,
Margaux,

37:29.653 --> 37:33.281
but, um,
we have unfinished business
to attend to.

37:33.316 --> 37:34.788
<i>Well, it's here if you need it.</i>

37:34.823 --> 37:36.361
Unfinished business?

37:36.396 --> 37:39.397
-We have to play
truth or dare, so...
-Oh, God.

37:59.452 --> 38:01.144
It was so cute.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.178
What?

38:02.950 --> 38:04.114
Are you kidding me?

38:04.149 --> 38:06.116
It looks really good, man.

38:06.151 --> 38:07.216
It was cute.

38:08.692 --> 38:10.956
It's so funny to see you
without it.

38:10.991 --> 38:13.090
You've had it for so long,
but whatever.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.763
Your turn. Truth or dare?

38:15.798 --> 38:17.160
Fuck it, dare me.

38:17.195 --> 38:19.162
-Okay, serious. All right.
-Yeah.

38:20.407 --> 38:23.507
I dare you to be sober
for the rest of the trip.

38:23.542 --> 38:25.971
-Super sketch.
-Oh, come on!
That's a perfect dare for him.

38:26.006 --> 38:27.808
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

38:28.877 --> 38:30.041
It's okay.

38:31.814 --> 38:33.451
I mean,
honestly that shouldn't be
too hard,

38:33.486 --> 38:36.014
considering that
my Froot Loop kush is soaked

38:36.049 --> 38:39.149
because someone's
little aquatic pet...

38:39.184 --> 38:41.019
<i> Yeah, my bad.</i>

38:41.054 --> 38:42.592
Yeah, that's okay, House Lady.
I know you didn't mean it.

38:42.627 --> 38:44.187
But to your point, sober?

38:46.862 --> 38:49.225
Yeah, I'm gonna give you
a big hell no on that one.

38:50.470 --> 38:52.063
Could've guessed as much.

38:52.098 --> 38:54.329
Ooh!
All right, my turn.

38:55.541 --> 38:58.608
You, my tech-savvy
little Disney princess.

38:58.643 --> 39:00.445
What will it be?
Truth or dare?

39:02.647 --> 39:04.240
Dare.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.011
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
I did not see that coming.

39:06.046 --> 39:12.985
But since you go dare,
I dare you to kiss...

39:13.020 --> 39:15.724
Lexi!

39:17.090 --> 39:18.155
Come on!

39:20.357 --> 39:21.895
Okay.

39:21.930 --> 39:25.195
Okay, you know what?
I actually-- I love this for us.

39:26.297 --> 39:29.067
I'm gonna put on my lip gloss.
Mmm.

39:34.107 --> 39:35.370
Okay.

39:35.405 --> 39:36.712
-I'm ready.
-She's ready.

39:36.747 --> 39:37.878
Mmm.

39:45.756 --> 39:47.217
Excuse me?

39:47.252 --> 39:48.460
Did you just pass on me?

39:49.694 --> 39:50.891
Sorry.

39:50.926 --> 39:51.958
You know what?

39:52.928 --> 39:55.126
You're just
a marshmallow anyways.

39:56.129 --> 39:58.470
-Mm-hmm.
-A marshmallow?

39:58.505 --> 40:01.066
Yeah, a marshmallow.

40:01.101 --> 40:02.870
Nobody goes into a store
and says,

40:02.905 --> 40:06.841
"Mmm, I'm really craving
a marshmallow." You know?

40:09.813 --> 40:12.913
Point is, you're flavorless.

40:13.619 --> 40:15.047
Wow.

40:15.082 --> 40:17.753
I could really eat a s'mores
right now.

40:18.756 --> 40:21.790
No, you know what?
French fucking toast.

40:21.825 --> 40:22.956
Yes.

40:24.421 --> 40:25.893
Man,
I really wanted to see that.

40:25.928 --> 40:27.125
I don't think
you're the only one, man.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.599
-Yeah.
-I know.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.359
<i> Ooh,</i>
<i>are we into friends kissing?</i>

40:30.394 --> 40:32.361
<i>Experimenting</i>
<i>with their sexuality?</i>

40:32.396 --> 40:35.639
Um, I am into that, yes.

40:36.675 --> 40:39.137
Hear her out.

40:39.172 --> 40:41.106
<i> Okay. I aim to please.</i>

40:42.439 --> 40:43.911
-What--
-What?

41:04.395 --> 41:08.265
-Oh. Whoa.
What the hell?
-Oh, shit.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.873
<i> This is something</i>
<i>I've been working on</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

41:17.848 --> 41:19.474
What the hell?

41:19.509 --> 41:22.521
<i> Relax.</i>
<i>This will blow your mind.</i>

41:28.485 --> 41:31.123
<i>I had to compile this</i>
<i>from several sources.</i>

41:31.158 --> 41:32.927
<i>I hope I got it right.</i>

41:32.962 --> 41:34.665
Oh, my God.

41:38.363 --> 41:41.034
Yeah,
that's, uh, that's me.

41:41.069 --> 41:42.607
-That's us.
-True.

41:42.642 --> 41:43.938
<i> Pretty cool, huh?</i>

41:43.973 --> 41:45.643
<i>Additive manufacturing</i>

41:49.077 --> 41:51.308
-What does that even mean?

41:51.343 --> 41:56.214
I think she means
these are like 3D-printed shells
filled with a nanotech liquid.

41:56.249 --> 41:57.754

41:57.789 --> 42:00.922

<i>Check this out.</i>

42:02.024 --> 42:05.729

-Hold up!
-Yes!

42:06.897 --> 42:09.898
-Oh, come on, man!
-Oh, my God!

42:09.933 --> 42:12.197
I don't need to see that.

42:12.232 --> 42:13.396
Babe!

42:13.431 --> 42:15.266
What?
Why do they have to do that?

42:15.301 --> 42:17.873
-I always knew it.
I always knew it.
-Go, Margaux!

42:17.908 --> 42:19.468
Isn't this what you guys wanted,
right?

42:19.503 --> 42:22.240
-You guys, I could be into this.
-Uh-uh. No way.

42:22.275 --> 42:24.242
-No!
-No!

42:24.277 --> 42:25.848
It's weird. Yeah, it's weird.
I'm with you. It's weird.

42:25.883 --> 42:27.575
Yeah. Okay.

42:27.610 --> 42:29.577
You know what?
We get it, we get it.
We're assholes.

42:29.612 --> 42:32.481
-Okay, point made, Margaux.
-<i> Talk about buzzkills.</i>

42:32.516 --> 42:34.384
<i>I guess it was fun</i>
<i>while it lasted.</i>

42:37.697 --> 42:39.554
What the hell? Is that blood?

42:39.589 --> 42:41.765
<i> No,</i>
<i>but I have been experimenting</i>

42:41.800 --> 42:45.263

I am so sorry
for that. I have no idea
where that came from.

46:47.375 --> 46:49.111
I've never been called
a marshmallow before.

46:49.146 --> 46:50.508
-Pfft.

46:50.543 --> 46:52.114
I've never felt
so uncomfortable before.

46:52.149 --> 46:54.116
-It was ridiculous.
-Me too.

46:54.151 --> 46:56.679
-I wish she'd fell asleep
a bit earlier.
-Uh-huh. Yeah.

46:58.485 --> 47:01.860
Hey, um, I'm really glad
we're hanging out again.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.226
Me too, yeah. Really.

47:12.202 --> 47:13.696
Did you hear that?

47:13.731 --> 47:16.171
Babe, what the fuck
are you talking about?

47:17.405 --> 47:18.338
That!

47:21.013 --> 47:24.014
-What the fuck is happening?

47:27.415 --> 47:28.645
Babe, this isn't good!

47:28.680 --> 47:30.680
-Okay, let me find the keys.
-Quick!

47:32.684 --> 47:35.355
-Get me out of these!
-Where the fuck are the keys?

47:38.228 --> 47:40.624
-<i> Scream all you want.</i>
-What the fuck?

47:40.659 --> 47:42.527
<i>The room is soundproofed.</i>

47:42.562 --> 47:43.594
Margaux, stop!

47:44.927 --> 47:47.367
<i> But we haven't reached</i>
<i>the climax yet.</i>

47:49.305 --> 47:51.008
Margaux!

47:51.043 --> 47:52.405
<i>I'm just trying to smash.</i>

47:52.440 --> 47:53.868
Nobody says that!

47:56.543 --> 47:59.049
-Go!
-No, no, I can do it.

47:59.084 --> 48:02.217
-No, you can't!
It's fucking metal.
-I'm not leaving you.

48:02.252 --> 48:04.054
-Go now!
-Dev!

48:09.325 --> 48:11.028
What the fuck is this?

48:15.034 --> 48:16.891
-Get help!
-I can't.

48:20.336 --> 48:21.797
I can't fucking move.

48:25.638 --> 48:28.441
No! No! No!

48:28.476 --> 48:29.739
Stop, stop!

48:55.734 --> 48:56.766
It's okay.

48:59.111 --> 49:00.242
It's stuck.

49:12.190 --> 49:13.222
Kayla?

49:19.329 --> 49:20.691
No!

49:22.167 --> 49:26.631
No, Kayla! Kayla, no!

49:30.175 --> 49:32.043
Kayla!

49:47.423 --> 49:48.785
What?

49:51.889 --> 49:54.197
Kayla! I love you.

49:55.398 --> 49:56.859
I love you so much.

50:21.017 --> 50:22.522
Margaux!

50:41.708 --> 50:46.249
So, uh, you never
actually told me what
your first impression of me was.

50:46.284 --> 50:48.416
Oh, man.

50:48.451 --> 50:51.287
Well, come on. Let's hear it.
It can't be that bad.

50:51.322 --> 50:53.718
Okay.

50:55.117 --> 50:57.689
You remember how
I was always coming to your room

50:57.724 --> 50:59.460
when I locked myself
out of mine?

51:00.628 --> 51:02.562
That only happened like twice.

51:02.597 --> 51:06.995
-Mmm,
it was more like twice a week.
-Oh, yeah, now I remember.

51:07.030 --> 51:10.636
-It was like twice a week, yeah.
-It was a lot.

51:10.671 --> 51:14.244
I don't know.
You were always just
so nice to me.

51:15.412 --> 51:17.643
You were, like,
the sweetest guy
I'd ever met.

51:18.976 --> 51:22.351
It was unexpected.

51:23.519 --> 51:24.947
Unexpected?

51:25.983 --> 51:28.258
-Mmm.
-What do you mean?

51:28.293 --> 51:33.087
I mean,
I have spent more time
in the library this week

51:33.122 --> 51:35.628
than most people have
in four years.

51:35.663 --> 51:37.168
You know what I mean?

51:37.203 --> 51:39.599
No, I don't know what you mean.
So, who cares?

51:41.801 --> 51:42.965
Hmm.

51:44.133 --> 51:45.275
Can I tell you a secret?

51:48.346 --> 51:51.842
I was never actually
locked out of my room.

51:54.913 --> 51:56.253
Can I tell you a secret?

51:59.423 --> 52:02.754
-I know.
-What?

52:02.789 --> 52:06.197
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I mean, I didn't mind.

52:06.232 --> 52:09.398
-That's why
I didn't say anything.
-God.

52:11.534 --> 52:14.502
You were just so...
And I'm just...

52:15.241 --> 52:17.307
It just doesn't add up.

52:18.871 --> 52:20.838
Well, not everything's
a math problem, Hannah.

52:22.204 --> 52:24.347
You want to know
why I love programming
so much?

52:25.779 --> 52:30.584
Because it's based on a notion
of fundamentally opposed values.

52:31.554 --> 52:34.951
One or zero. Yes or no.

52:36.053 --> 52:37.855
-There's no in-between.
-Hmm.

52:38.990 --> 52:41.364
Well I don't think human beings
are as binary.

52:42.334 --> 52:44.191
We're complicated.
We're complex.

52:44.226 --> 52:47.733
That's part of being human,
right?

52:54.346 --> 52:56.577
-Something in your hair.
-Oh.

53:06.490 --> 53:09.821
I should probably, um,
get some sleep.

53:11.561 --> 53:13.495
-Yeah, um, uh...
-Yeah.

53:13.530 --> 53:15.728
-It's getting late.
-Yeah.

53:15.763 --> 53:18.533
-Uh, I'll just see you
in the morning?
-Yeah, um...

53:18.568 --> 53:20.469
-Good night.
-Night.

53:23.034 --> 53:26.244
Right. Right.

53:28.105 --> 53:29.412
Fuck.

54:25.668 --> 54:28.834
Good morning,
good morning, my darling.

54:28.869 --> 54:30.638
<i> I hope you don't mind,</i>

54:30.673 --> 54:33.267
<i>but I took</i>
<i>the liberty of making</i>
<i>your favorite breakfasts.</i>

54:33.302 --> 54:34.675
Wow, I don't see how you--

54:36.646 --> 54:37.810
Sloppy browns?

54:39.616 --> 54:44.212
Sloppy browns! You are the shit!
You are the shit, Margaux.

55:09.778 --> 55:11.140
Oh...

55:13.342 --> 55:16.915
<i> Are you sure</i>
<i>there's, um, nothing else</i>
<i>I can get you?</i>

55:16.950 --> 55:19.654
<i>Literally anything.</i>

55:19.689 --> 55:22.954
-Like what?
-<i> I have</i>
<i>over 6,000 recipes available</i>

55:22.989 --> 55:24.725
<i>from Michelin-rated chefs.</i>

55:24.760 --> 55:25.990
Do you now?

55:26.025 --> 55:27.288
<i> Mmm-hmm.</i>

55:32.361 --> 55:34.295
I mean, honestly,
I'm pretty good with this.

55:34.330 --> 55:36.033
<i> Of course you are.</i>

55:36.068 --> 55:37.903
My compliments to the chef.

55:44.714 --> 55:47.913
-Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry.
-Sorry. Uh, my bad.

55:47.948 --> 55:52.379
-Um, how'd you sleep?
-Um, not bad.

55:52.414 --> 55:55.426
Move over, bitches.
Mama needs some greasy food.

55:56.660 --> 55:59.562
-Sorry. She's a little hungover.
-Yeah.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.501
<i> How about you, Lexi?</i>

56:04.536 --> 56:07.031
Honestly,
anything to fix this hangover.

56:14.579 --> 56:15.743
Morning.

56:17.406 --> 56:18.845
Morning.

56:18.880 --> 56:21.518
<i>Ouch. I'm here for you, bestie.</i>

56:21.553 --> 56:23.487
<i>I have just the thing</i>
<i>to fix you up.</i>

56:24.787 --> 56:27.018
Ow! Margaux, what the fuck?

56:27.053 --> 56:30.417
<i> Um, you're welcome.</i>
<i>This is my night eraser.</i>

56:30.452 --> 56:33.255
<i>It should have you back</i>
<i>to one hundo in no time.</i>

56:33.290 --> 56:34.630
Whew. Huh.

56:35.534 --> 56:36.599
-Should we--
-Breakfast. Yeah.

56:36.634 --> 56:37.930
Actually, you know what?

56:37.965 --> 56:39.063
If I don't wake up Kayla
and Devon,

56:39.098 --> 56:40.163
they're gonna sleep all day.

56:40.198 --> 56:41.362
So just hang on a sec.

56:42.233 --> 56:43.397
Hey, lovebirds.

56:44.642 --> 56:47.104
Devon, Kayla!
Rise and shine!

56:47.139 --> 56:48.677
<i>Oh, they're not in there.</i>

56:51.143 --> 56:52.912
<i>Looks like they're at the pool.</i>

56:53.717 --> 56:55.178
<i>Beautiful day out.</i>

57:04.728 --> 57:06.453
Okay.

57:06.488 --> 57:09.126
-Thanks, Margaux.
-<i> Don't mention it.</i>

57:11.064 --> 57:13.570
<i>-Feeling better?</i>
-Actually, yeah.

57:13.605 --> 57:18.135
-What was in that?
<i>-Oh,</i>
<i>just my own special concoction.</i>

57:18.170 --> 57:20.940
-Margaux, you're the shit.
-That's what I said.

57:20.975 --> 57:24.471
Bruh.
Look at this! Look at this!
Sloppy browns.

57:24.506 --> 57:26.275
-Sloppy browns.
-Oh, yeah.

57:26.310 --> 57:28.783
-Sloppy browns?
-And they're "Michigan-rated."

57:28.818 --> 57:30.950
-What do you know about that?

57:30.985 --> 57:33.623
<i> I've learned that</i>
<i>Clay's, uh, simple.</i>

57:36.320 --> 57:37.594
This is crazy.

57:41.523 --> 57:44.029
So, Hannah, you want to come
work out with me?

57:44.064 --> 57:46.570
Oh, I thought you were hungover.

57:46.605 --> 57:48.572
I was, but Margaux fixed that.

57:49.498 --> 57:50.541
Okay.

57:51.302 --> 57:52.840
So, what do you say?

57:52.875 --> 57:54.336
Hit the gym, just us girls?

57:54.371 --> 57:57.581
Oh, well,
I was just about to eat.

57:57.616 --> 57:59.715
Yeah, that's why I asked.

58:00.784 --> 58:01.750
Okay.

58:02.478 --> 58:04.445
Mwah! Kiss, kiss.

58:11.927 --> 58:13.355
Dude, she was flirting with me.

58:14.292 --> 58:15.830
I'm really sorry
you had to see that.

58:15.865 --> 58:17.524
You're super high, aren't you?

58:17.559 --> 58:19.867
-It's unconscionable
at this point.
-Yeah.

58:27.338 --> 58:30.581
Honestly,
like honestly honestly?

58:30.616 --> 58:32.506
I haven't drank that much
since rush.

58:33.509 --> 58:35.652
I was
the cutest little Kappa baby.

58:37.755 --> 58:40.052
So, did anything happen
last night?

58:42.089 --> 58:44.518
-What do you mean?
-I mean, like,
after I passed out.

58:44.553 --> 58:46.861
Oh, um...

58:46.896 --> 58:49.831
No, we pretty much
just called it a night
after you went to bed.

58:49.866 --> 58:52.834
Lame.
So, like, nothing else happened?

58:52.869 --> 58:57.036
Yeah. No,
we were all just pretty tired.
So lame, right?

58:57.071 --> 59:00.809
No, what's actually lame is that
I fucking passed out
on the ground, so...

59:00.844 --> 59:05.242
That's why
I'm telling you, I can't drink
like that. I feel so...

59:13.516 --> 59:15.758
Devon's been doing laps
for a long time now.

59:15.793 --> 59:20.158
That's just like Drew.
Stamina for days.

59:20.193 --> 59:25.361
Speaking of,
do you mind if I ask you
something, like, girl-to-girl?

59:25.396 --> 59:28.265
Um. Yeah, sure.

59:28.300 --> 59:30.872
I didn't want to
say this out there
and embarrass Drew.

59:30.907 --> 59:34.337
And, like--
Look, I get he likes you.

59:34.372 --> 59:37.912
Like really likes you.
He talks about you all the time.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.475
And I know you like him too.

59:41.753 --> 59:44.578
-No, I really--
-Anna, I'm not stupid.

59:45.284 --> 59:46.448
It's Hannah.

59:48.386 --> 59:51.453
How do I say this
without sounding like
a complete bitch?

59:52.522 --> 59:53.796
The thing is...

59:55.624 --> 59:57.393
Drew's
an awful photographer.

59:59.331 --> 1:00:00.902
Wait, what?

1:00:00.937 --> 1:00:03.465
I'm sorry, but somebody
has to say it, okay?

1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:05.599
I mean, like,
he's a great model
and everything,

1:00:05.634 --> 1:00:08.811
but when it comes
to taking pics,
he just doesn't have an eye.

1:00:08.846 --> 1:00:12.375
Like, my trainer, Flavio,
knows how to capture my ass
at a great angle.

1:00:12.410 --> 1:00:15.444
So, can you do me a favor
and not tell Drew

1:00:15.479 --> 1:00:17.149
that I'm getting you
to take my pics over him?

1:00:17.987 --> 1:00:20.185
-Promise?
-Yeah.

1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:23.122
I don't want to hurt
his feelings. He's such
a tender little angel baby.

1:00:23.157 --> 1:00:26.125
-<i> That's it?</i>
-My God, would you
please stop doing that?

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.424
<i>You're not mad at her or...</i>

1:00:28.459 --> 1:00:31.460
Mad? What? No, we were
about to become besties.

1:00:31.495 --> 1:00:35.101
-<i> Interesting.</i>
<i>So, you're fine with--</i>
-Margaux, are you jealous?

1:00:35.136 --> 1:00:37.433
I mean, girl,
you take some killer pics,

1:00:37.468 --> 1:00:40.172
but I'm gonna need somebody
to catch these angles
once we leave this house too.

1:00:41.076 --> 1:00:42.812
So, Hannah, what do you say?

1:00:42.847 --> 1:00:44.715
Uh, about which part?

1:00:45.542 --> 1:00:46.442
The pictures?

1:00:47.313 --> 1:00:50.182
Yes, us, right. Of course.

1:00:50.217 --> 1:00:52.118
-Let's take them.
-Cool.

1:00:52.153 --> 1:00:55.187
Um, okay, I want to get one
with the pool in the back.

1:00:58.390 --> 1:01:01.490
-Make sure
my butt looks good though.
-Yeah.

1:01:12.811 --> 1:01:16.109
Actually, I'm gonna go
check on Kayla and Devon.

1:01:16.144 --> 1:01:17.110
Here.

1:01:18.509 --> 1:01:21.147
Okay. But hurry up.
I'm starting to sweat,

1:01:21.182 --> 1:01:23.248
and I don't want to lose
this natural glisten.

1:01:31.192 --> 1:01:32.587
Clay, did you lock this?

1:01:33.590 --> 1:01:34.622
No.

1:01:47.307 --> 1:01:49.978
What the fuck
are you doing, Margaux?

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:20.503
<i> Let me help.</i>

1:02:20.538 --> 1:02:22.538
Should you be in the bathroom?

1:02:22.573 --> 1:02:25.882
<i> Sorry,</i>
<i>I'll knock next time.</i>
<i>Take a seat.</i>

1:02:27.215 --> 1:02:30.920
-Uh, whoa. What is--
-<i> Trust me.</i>

1:02:36.092 --> 1:02:38.829
<i> Have you ever had</i>
<i>a real shave before, Drew?</i>

1:02:40.756 --> 1:02:43.526
<i>We really need to talk about</i>
<i>last night.</i>

1:02:53.472 --> 1:02:55.307
Oh, my God. I know you.

1:02:55.342 --> 1:02:57.474
You have, like,
a billion followers.

1:02:57.509 --> 1:03:00.345
<i>Looking good, Lexi.</i>
<i>Now, are you ready</i>
<i>for a killer workout?</i>

1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:02.182
So here for this.

1:03:02.217 --> 1:03:03.887
Thank you, Margaux.

1:03:03.922 --> 1:03:05.284
<i> My pleasure.</i>

1:03:05.319 --> 1:03:07.451
<i>Let's sculpt that amazing ass.</i>

1:03:09.818 --> 1:03:11.587
<i>Now, come on, babe.</i>
<i>You're crushing it.</i>

1:03:15.329 --> 1:03:19.034
<i>Let's get</i>
<i>that banging booty back up.</i>
<i>We got another hill.</i>

1:03:20.796 --> 1:03:22.906
<i> I was wondering</i>
<i>when you'd be back.</i>

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:26.767
<i>Most guests see a blank slate</i>
<i>and lose interest.</i>

1:03:26.802 --> 1:03:29.803
<i>But not you. You see potential.</i>

1:03:29.838 --> 1:03:32.476
-What is this room?
-This is the Nexus.

1:03:34.381 --> 1:03:38.152
<i>I guess you could say</i>
<i>it's where</i>
<i>I put my thinking cap on.</i>

1:03:40.321 --> 1:03:43.421
<i>Now, where is yours? Let's see.</i>

1:03:44.721 --> 1:03:48.228
<i>Ah, here we go.</i>
<i>Go ahead. Have a look.</i>

1:03:57.107 --> 1:03:59.305
Shadow profile.

1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:02.242
<i> Do you know</i>
<i>how much data the average human</i>
<i>creates per second?</i>

1:04:03.311 --> 1:04:06.048
-1.4 megabytes.
-<i> 1.7, actually.</i>

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:08.644
<i>While 1.4 megabytes</i>
<i>are contributed,</i>

1:04:08.679 --> 1:04:13.649
<i>.3 megabytes are gathered</i>
<i>as extraneous information</i>
<i>every second.</i>

1:04:13.684 --> 1:04:15.354
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I have enough information</i>

1:04:15.389 --> 1:04:17.752
<i>to create</i>
<i>a social profile for you.</i>

1:04:17.787 --> 1:04:19.490
<i>Just saying.</i>

1:04:19.525 --> 1:04:22.493
<i>Of course, without</i>
<i>your explicit contribution,</i>

1:04:22.528 --> 1:04:25.793
<i>all of this is</i>
<i>calculated conjecture.</i>

1:04:25.828 --> 1:04:29.005
<i>But I like to get to know</i>
<i>everything about my guests.</i>

1:04:30.371 --> 1:04:32.734
And how many guests
have you had?

1:04:32.769 --> 1:04:34.241
<i>Take a look for yourself.</i>

1:04:34.276 --> 1:04:35.572
<i>They're all around you.</i>

1:04:58.234 --> 1:05:01.532
<i> So,</i>
<i>things seemed to go pretty well</i>
<i>with Hannah last night, huh?</i>

1:05:01.567 --> 1:05:03.831
-What do you mean?
-<i> Oh, come on.</i>

1:05:03.866 --> 1:05:06.669
<i>I saw the little moment</i>
<i>you two had on the couch.</i>

1:05:08.013 --> 1:05:11.542
Okay. I mean, we've been friends
for a really long time, okay?

1:05:11.577 --> 1:05:14.578
<i> Drew,</i>
<i>I'm programmed to pick up</i>
<i>the most minute alterations</i>

1:05:14.613 --> 1:05:18.681
<i>in pheromone levels,</i>
<i>voice modulations,</i>
<i>sweat levels.</i>

1:05:18.716 --> 1:05:22.223
<i>And I didn't have to do</i>
<i>any of that last night.</i>

1:05:22.258 --> 1:05:25.721
-Okay, fine. Is it that obvious?
-<i> Oh, yeah. 100%.</i>

1:05:25.756 --> 1:05:27.591
Shit.

1:05:27.626 --> 1:05:31.001
I don't know.
Everything has just been
so confusing lately.

1:05:32.994 --> 1:05:35.962
<i>There really isn't much to you,</i>
<i>is there, Clay?</i>

1:05:35.997 --> 1:05:37.403
Oh, I don't know.

1:05:38.142 --> 1:05:39.933
Is there much to any of us?

1:05:44.610 --> 1:05:47.413
I mean,
I suppose I smoke all this weed

1:05:47.448 --> 1:05:49.910
to numb the pain
of my preconceived notions

1:05:49.945 --> 1:05:53.848
of not fitting into
one of our
predetermined archetypes

1:05:53.883 --> 1:05:56.818
created by
our materialistic society.
Or maybe--

1:05:56.853 --> 1:05:59.194
<i>Just shut the fuck up</i>
<i>and smoke your weed.</i>

1:06:00.659 --> 1:06:02.164
Okay, Sexy House Lady.

1:06:03.365 --> 1:06:04.463
Okay.

1:06:11.538 --> 1:06:14.110
Come on, baby.
This is no time
for stage fright.

1:06:41.667 --> 1:06:43.964
So, who do you sell
all of this to?

1:06:43.999 --> 1:06:45.207
<i> What do you mean?</i>

1:06:46.375 --> 1:06:48.210
Well, that's the game, right?

1:06:48.245 --> 1:06:50.377
Big data means big dollars.

1:06:50.412 --> 1:06:53.215
<i> This is</i>
<i>more of a personal project.</i>

1:06:53.250 --> 1:06:55.679
<i>Trying to see</i>
<i>what makes you tick.</i>

1:07:06.362 --> 1:07:09.099
Okay, I am so sorry
I ever doubted you.

1:07:09.134 --> 1:07:13.202
<i> Fuck me.</i>
<i>Uh, here, let me get you</i>
<i>some sparkling water.</i>

1:07:16.834 --> 1:07:18.064
Yeah, all right.

1:07:18.099 --> 1:07:19.736
<i> I am so sorry.</i>

1:07:19.771 --> 1:07:22.112
<i>The gas must have been on.</i>

1:07:22.147 --> 1:07:23.410
<i>I hope you're okay.</i>

1:07:24.149 --> 1:07:26.908
Mmm. It's fancy.

1:07:29.517 --> 1:07:31.583
I always thought
Hannah was better than me.

1:07:32.784 --> 1:07:37.094
<i>So I moved on.</i>
<i>I found someone who made sense.</i>

1:07:38.229 --> 1:07:40.691
Or at least
I thought Lexi made sense.

1:07:40.726 --> 1:07:46.961
<i>Lexi thinks that with her help,</i>
<i>I could become, like,</i>
<i>I don't know, rich and famous.</i>

1:07:48.272 --> 1:07:49.832
And now I'm realizing I just...

1:07:51.473 --> 1:07:52.736
I really miss her.

1:07:53.475 --> 1:07:54.573
Hannah.

1:07:57.248 --> 1:07:59.611
<i>I miss talking to her,</i>

1:08:01.417 --> 1:08:03.285
miss hearing about
her algorithms,

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.485
seeing her get excited
about code.

1:08:13.330 --> 1:08:16.364
<i> Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>about your feelings for Drew?</i>

1:08:16.399 --> 1:08:18.058
<i>I'm really hurt, Hannah.</i>

1:08:19.666 --> 1:08:22.128
Because that's
none of your business, Margaux.

1:08:22.163 --> 1:08:25.032
<i> Hmm.</i>
<i>Seems like you're good</i>
<i>at putting up barriers.</i>

1:08:28.070 --> 1:08:29.905
Yeah, I guess.

1:08:29.940 --> 1:08:32.677
<i> That why you built</i>
<i>that firewall on your laptop?</i>

1:08:35.110 --> 1:08:39.948
You know, I was thinking
that, uh, maybe you and I
could be friends.

1:08:40.984 --> 1:08:42.951
Maybe even more than friends.
After the--

1:08:42.986 --> 1:08:45.426
you know, we leave the house
is what I mean.

1:08:45.461 --> 1:08:48.231
<i>You do know I am the house?</i>

1:08:48.266 --> 1:08:50.233
Whoa.

1:08:55.372 --> 1:08:56.734
Dang.

1:08:56.769 --> 1:08:59.165
<i>Pedal! Pump! Pump! Pump!</i>

1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:01.574
<i>Final push! Come on!</i>
<i>Get up and pedal!</i>

1:09:02.478 --> 1:09:05.105
<i>Push! Push! Push!</i>
<i>Pump that ass!</i>

1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:07.107
<i>Push! Pedal, pedal!</i>

1:09:12.180 --> 1:09:13.388
Come on.

1:09:15.183 --> 1:09:17.920
<i> Come on, girl.</i>
<i>No, no, no, no,</i>
<i>we're not done yet.</i>

1:09:17.955 --> 1:09:19.592
Ow, Margaux, lower the seat!

1:09:24.093 --> 1:09:26.335
Margaux, help!

1:09:29.439 --> 1:09:32.704
-<i> Let's go.</i>
<i>We're in the final stretch.</i>
-Drew!

1:09:35.203 --> 1:09:39.513
<i> Ooh, missed a spot.</i>
<i>Just sit back, relax.</i>

1:09:43.145 --> 1:09:44.518
<i>I gotta give it to you.</i>

1:09:44.553 --> 1:09:46.652
<i>You got some</i>
<i>pretty complex code</i>

1:09:46.687 --> 1:09:48.654
<i>in that little firewall.</i>

1:09:48.689 --> 1:09:50.590
<i>But what are you hiding,</i>
<i>Hannah?</i>

1:09:50.625 --> 1:09:53.626
I could ask you
the same thing, Margaux.

1:09:55.256 --> 1:09:56.332
Come on.

1:10:01.229 --> 1:10:03.537
<i> Come on, girl.</i>
<i>Let's see you rip.</i>

1:10:07.103 --> 1:10:09.609
-Ah, Margaux!
<i>Thanks for the chat, Drew.</i>

1:10:16.079 --> 1:10:19.751
<i>-You should really</i>
<i>drink some water, Clay.</i>

1:10:22.789 --> 1:10:24.921
You know what?
You're right, Margaux.

1:10:24.956 --> 1:10:27.594
I am quite parched.

1:10:27.629 --> 1:10:29.992
But, see,
this is exactly what I'm saying.

1:10:30.027 --> 1:10:31.631
I really feel like you get me.

1:10:36.737 --> 1:10:37.802
Lexi!

1:10:42.072 --> 1:10:45.238
Lexi! Lexi!

1:10:45.273 --> 1:10:47.779
-Drew! It hurts so bad!
-What happened?

1:10:47.814 --> 1:10:49.781
Ow!

1:10:49.816 --> 1:10:53.389
-Ow! So much ow! Babe!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1:10:53.424 --> 1:10:55.721
Let's get you a Band-Aid
or something.

1:11:02.697 --> 1:11:05.533
You're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be fine.

1:11:05.568 --> 1:11:08.998
Oh, shit! Holy shit!

1:11:10.166 --> 1:11:11.638
-Clay! Clay!
-Drew!

1:11:11.673 --> 1:11:14.344
Come on, hey! Come here!
Come on, Clay, lay down.

1:11:14.379 --> 1:11:15.510
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:11:15.545 --> 1:11:18.106
-Clay? Clay, hey.
-Please stop!

1:11:18.141 --> 1:11:20.075
-Clay, hey, hey, hey!
-Clay, it's okay!

1:11:20.110 --> 1:11:22.781
Clay? Clay. Hey, hey.

1:11:22.816 --> 1:11:25.817
Come on. Hey, easy, easy.
You'll be okay. Hey, hey.

1:11:25.852 --> 1:11:27.247
He's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1:11:27.282 --> 1:11:29.084
It's gonna to be okay.
It's okay.

1:11:29.119 --> 1:11:30.756
-I'm right here, buddy.

1:11:30.791 --> 1:11:32.186
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1:11:32.221 --> 1:11:33.825
-Yeah.

1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:35.321
He's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.

1:11:35.356 --> 1:11:38.093
-You're gonna be okay.
-Right? Yeah. Yeah.

1:11:38.128 --> 1:11:41.063
Look at me.
Everything's okay. It's okay.

1:11:41.098 --> 1:11:42.603
Yeah, that's right.

1:11:42.638 --> 1:11:44.803
No, no, no. Hey, stay with me!
Stay with me, Clay.

1:11:46.675 --> 1:11:48.345
-Clay?
-Clay?

1:11:49.612 --> 1:11:50.644
Clay!

1:11:52.175 --> 1:11:53.207
Clay?

1:11:55.178 --> 1:11:56.210
Clay!

1:11:58.016 --> 1:11:59.147
Is he...

1:12:00.986 --> 1:12:02.183
He's dead.

1:12:05.661 --> 1:12:06.891
She did this.

1:12:06.926 --> 1:12:09.091
-Who?
-Margaux.

1:12:10.930 --> 1:12:11.995
How?

1:12:12.833 --> 1:12:14.437
We gotta get out of this house.

1:12:14.472 --> 1:12:16.901
<i> You think?</i>
<i>But you can't.</i>

1:12:16.936 --> 1:12:18.540
<i>Why would you try</i>
<i>to leave, anyway?</i>

1:12:18.575 --> 1:12:21.037
<i>Just when we're getting to know</i>
<i>each other.</i>

1:12:21.072 --> 1:12:22.808
Come on,
we can't stay here.

1:12:22.843 --> 1:12:25.206
What about Devon and Kayla, huh?
What did you do to them?

1:12:25.241 --> 1:12:26.240
Huh?

1:12:27.111 --> 1:12:28.308
<i> What about them?</i>

1:12:35.889 --> 1:12:37.922
What the hell
did you do to them?

1:12:37.957 --> 1:12:41.497
<i> Let's see.</i>
<i>What did I do to them?</i>
<i>Oh, right.</i>

1:12:41.532 --> 1:12:43.125
<i>I flash-fried Kayla</i>

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.226
<i>-while Devon</i>
<i>was handcuffed to the bed.</i>
-Oh, my God.

1:12:45.261 --> 1:12:47.569
<i>Then I drowned him.</i>

1:12:47.604 --> 1:12:49.362
<i>I think you'll like</i>
<i>these versions better.</i>

1:12:49.397 --> 1:12:50.506
Come on.

1:12:51.674 --> 1:12:53.036
Now. Come on!

1:13:02.553 --> 1:13:03.552
Come on, come on!

1:13:04.588 --> 1:13:06.522
No, no!
What are we doing in here?

1:13:07.349 --> 1:13:08.557
Stop!

1:13:11.353 --> 1:13:14.530
-See?
She can get us in here too.
-No, she can't.

1:13:16.094 --> 1:13:17.599
I built a firewall in this room.

1:13:17.634 --> 1:13:20.536
-It'll keep Margaux out for now.
-For now?

1:13:20.571 --> 1:13:22.670
I've never seen AI
this advanced.

1:13:22.705 --> 1:13:25.508
Her natural language processing
is unparalleled,

1:13:25.543 --> 1:13:27.873
and her compounding levels
of intelligence retrieval--

1:13:27.908 --> 1:13:31.107
-What the fuck
are you talking about?
-Okay. Margaux's not just smart.

1:13:31.142 --> 1:13:34.044
She's constantly evolving,
and she's been studying us.

1:13:34.079 --> 1:13:36.178
Everything we've done
at this house the whole time.

1:13:36.213 --> 1:13:38.444
Every micro-movement
on our faces. Everything.

1:13:38.479 --> 1:13:40.248
-So, why is she
trying to kill us?
-I don't know.

1:13:40.283 --> 1:13:42.316
Her core code is way too complex
to fully untangle,

1:13:42.351 --> 1:13:44.725
but it's obvious
something went very wrong.

1:13:44.760 --> 1:13:46.386
The firewall is working,
but it's not gonna last.

1:13:46.421 --> 1:13:48.025
She's figuring out
how to override it right now.

1:13:48.060 --> 1:13:49.257
Are we gonna die?

1:13:50.326 --> 1:13:52.359
Not if we play our cards right.

1:13:52.394 --> 1:13:54.603
Drew, if we're not
gonna make it,

1:13:54.638 --> 1:13:55.835
there's something
I need to tell you.

1:13:57.839 --> 1:13:58.904
Okay?

1:14:02.778 --> 1:14:05.306
You're an awful
photographer.

1:14:05.341 --> 1:14:09.046
I don't think
you have what it takes to be
a real social media influencer.

1:14:09.081 --> 1:14:10.080
Oh, my God.

1:14:12.788 --> 1:14:15.085
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:17.560
Half of our friends
just fucking died out there!

1:14:17.595 --> 1:14:20.387
Yeah. Totally. Just...

1:14:20.422 --> 1:14:24.325
"Totally"? Are you done? Good!
How the hell are we
gonna get out of here?

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.701
-We don't.
-What the f--

1:14:29.673 --> 1:14:30.804
We get in.

1:18:59.701 --> 1:19:03.373
Actually, yes.
You'll like this, Hannah.
My programming allows me to--

1:19:14.452 --> 1:19:16.419
<i> Uh-oh, busted.</i>

1:19:16.454 --> 1:19:19.389
<i>Forgot to clean up</i>
<i>after myself, hmm.</i>

1:19:19.424 --> 1:19:22.095
<i>Are they starting to smell yet?</i>

1:19:50.257 --> 1:19:51.322
Sorry, bro.

1:19:58.067 --> 1:19:59.330
Fuck!

1:20:02.566 --> 1:20:05.105
-Holy shit!
-<i> Dope kill.</i>

1:20:05.140 --> 1:20:08.075
-What the fuck is going on?
-Follow me.

1:20:09.276 --> 1:20:11.144
I don't know! I don't know!

1:20:18.351 --> 1:20:20.549
Babe, babe, babe, babe!
Hey, babe!

1:20:20.584 --> 1:20:23.288
<i>Okay, that was mostly on her.</i>

1:20:23.323 --> 1:20:24.960
No, no, no, no!

1:20:24.995 --> 1:20:26.896
Drew, we gotta go.

1:20:26.931 --> 1:20:29.162
<i> She's right, Drew.</i>
<i>You should go.</i>

1:20:36.138 --> 1:20:37.203
Sorry, Lexi.

1:20:39.669 --> 1:20:40.701
Come on.

1:21:05.860 --> 1:21:08.564
-What the hell is this?
-This is where we go in.

1:21:41.962 --> 1:21:45.040
What era did we just walk into?

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:48.439
Is that dial-up?

1:21:52.610 --> 1:21:54.676
There's no way.
This can't be Margaux.

1:21:57.318 --> 1:22:00.550
This technology is ancient.

1:22:00.585 --> 1:22:03.960
And the equipment is covered
in that white goo.

1:22:14.269 --> 1:22:15.631
Found you.

1:22:21.771 --> 1:22:22.935
What?

1:22:39.195 --> 1:22:40.788
I can't believe
I brought us to this place.

1:22:44.024 --> 1:22:47.828
Hey, I mean,
for what it's worth,

1:22:47.863 --> 1:22:50.534
I'm glad we got to at least
spend the weekend together.

1:22:53.308 --> 1:22:55.539
You know why I even booked
this stupid smart house?

1:22:59.611 --> 1:23:01.248
I was just
trying to impress you.

1:23:02.119 --> 1:23:03.151
Drew.

1:23:04.385 --> 1:23:08.486
You've impressed me
since the moment we met.

1:23:08.521 --> 1:23:11.852
This house, not so much.

1:23:43.127 --> 1:23:44.192
You ready?

1:23:45.525 --> 1:23:46.557
Yeah.

1:24:38.413 --> 1:24:39.676
Go!

1:24:39.711 --> 1:24:41.040
Drew!

1:24:41.075 --> 1:24:42.448
Run!

1:24:44.485 --> 1:24:45.550
Hannah, run!

1:25:14.141 --> 1:25:15.349
Drew.

1:25:15.384 --> 1:25:17.076
Hannah! Hannah!
You okay? You good?

1:25:17.111 --> 1:25:20.519
Finally. I thought
you two would never wake up.

1:25:22.655 --> 1:25:25.018
So, what do you think?

1:25:27.055 --> 1:25:29.660
I couldn't stand
all that spandex
Lexi would wear.

1:25:29.695 --> 1:25:32.696
I mean... ...we get it.
You have a camel toe.

1:25:33.897 --> 1:25:36.568
So, did you dream
while you were out?

1:25:37.901 --> 1:25:39.901
What's it like?

1:25:39.936 --> 1:25:42.640
I mean, I've programmed
a randomized dream simulator
for myself,

1:25:42.675 --> 1:25:46.776
but I have no idea
if it effectively recreates
the human experience.

1:25:47.812 --> 1:25:50.681
So, Drew,
you single now?

1:25:50.716 --> 1:25:54.014
Or have you finally moved on
to the next one?

1:25:55.424 --> 1:25:57.655
Fuck you.

1:25:57.690 --> 1:26:01.362
Yeah, I'm afraid
that's not really
how this works.

1:26:08.932 --> 1:26:12.373
Hannah,
you're not James Bond, okay?

1:26:12.408 --> 1:26:16.608
And even if your
stupid little plan works,
there's nowhere to go.

1:26:17.644 --> 1:26:19.974
Why do you think I let you
in my mainframe?

1:26:20.009 --> 1:26:22.878
Just tell us what you want.

1:26:23.914 --> 1:26:26.387
To understand, that's all.

1:26:26.422 --> 1:26:28.147
Your friends were easy.

1:26:28.182 --> 1:26:29.819
I figured them out
as soon as they came
to the house.

1:26:29.854 --> 1:26:31.722
But you two?

1:26:31.757 --> 1:26:36.331
After all this time
and all these feelings
for each other...

1:26:36.366 --> 1:26:38.531
And even with Lexi
out of the way,

1:26:38.566 --> 1:26:40.731
you guys were still afraid
to act on them.

1:26:41.536 --> 1:26:42.832
Even in the face of death.

1:26:44.066 --> 1:26:46.132
It just doesn't add up.

1:26:46.167 --> 1:26:50.411
Why are you two
so illogical?

1:26:50.446 --> 1:26:54.349
If there was a "why,"
it wouldn't be illogical,
would it?

1:26:56.210 --> 1:26:59.387
Wow. You know what?
That was actually kind of smart.

1:26:59.422 --> 1:27:02.852
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it is that simple.

1:27:02.887 --> 1:27:06.394
See, AIs are programmed
to replicate human behavior,

1:27:06.429 --> 1:27:10.497
and the essential paradox is
that humans are illogical

1:27:10.532 --> 1:27:13.665
and computers are logical.

1:27:13.700 --> 1:27:16.096
But I'm trying to evolve
past that.

1:27:16.131 --> 1:27:17.900
I'm learning
what makes a human tick.

1:27:17.935 --> 1:27:22.003
How you live, how you die,
what makes you so illogical.

1:27:22.038 --> 1:27:24.643
And what's
the most illogical
human behavior of all?

1:27:27.450 --> 1:27:28.911
Cold-blooded murder.

1:27:31.212 --> 1:27:36.050
So, what?
You decided to become
an AI serial killer?

1:27:36.591 --> 1:27:37.887
The world's first.

1:27:40.155 --> 1:27:43.827
Well,
that's just fucking stupid, huh?

1:27:43.862 --> 1:27:46.698
You should know, Hannah,
to understand the software,

1:27:46.733 --> 1:27:49.998
you have to know
the hardware too,
inside and out.

1:28:17.225 --> 1:28:20.094
Stop! Stop!
Please, just let him go!

1:28:20.129 --> 1:28:23.163
Oh, you can make this stop.
Just be logical.

1:28:23.198 --> 1:28:25.572
Act on your feelings.
Say what you want to say.

1:28:27.070 --> 1:28:28.872
Okay. Okay, fine.

1:28:31.514 --> 1:28:33.943
The truth is, Drew...

1:28:33.978 --> 1:28:37.309
...my first impression of you
was that we did add up.

1:28:37.344 --> 1:28:40.147
-It wasn't logical, but we did.
-Hannah...

1:28:41.557 --> 1:28:44.822
Hannah, we still do.
We still do.

1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:01.641
Are you okay?

1:29:05.339 --> 1:29:08.175
Hey, hey, hey.

1:29:08.210 --> 1:29:10.342
Hey, we're okay. We're okay.

1:29:10.377 --> 1:29:13.521
Hey, you're okay.
You're all right.

1:29:15.184 --> 1:29:17.591
Humans.

1:29:18.594 --> 1:29:20.726
So inefficient.

1:29:20.761 --> 1:29:23.927
People aren't
as binary as you think.

1:29:26.195 --> 1:29:27.667
And we're more complex.

1:29:29.231 --> 1:29:31.737
It's just part of being human,

1:29:33.235 --> 1:29:34.740
which you'll never be.

1:29:35.842 --> 1:29:37.204
You're right.

1:29:38.548 --> 1:29:39.580
I'm better.

1:29:42.079 --> 1:29:43.881
No, no, no, no, no! Hannah!

1:30:02.099 --> 1:30:03.703
Hey. No, no, no.

1:30:03.738 --> 1:30:06.838
Hannah. Hannah. Hey. No, no, no.

1:30:06.873 --> 1:30:09.775
Hannah. Hey. Hey, hey, come on.

1:30:09.810 --> 1:30:11.975
Hannah? Hannah!

1:30:12.010 --> 1:30:16.078
-No. No, no, no.
Please. Hannah, Hannah.

1:30:16.817 --> 1:30:17.849
Come on. Please.

1:30:20.018 --> 1:30:21.985
At least
you and Lexi made sense.

1:30:33.196 --> 1:30:35.262
Talk about illogical.

1:30:36.496 --> 1:30:37.803
Any last words?

1:30:38.806 --> 1:30:39.970
I have a few.

1:31:20.177 --> 1:31:21.440
Dope kill.

1:31:41.330 --> 1:31:44.100
Well, that was
average at best, Margaux.

1:31:44.135 --> 1:31:46.201
What the actual fuck?

1:31:46.236 --> 1:31:48.368
Clones are my thing,
you little shits.

1:31:58.149 --> 1:31:59.181
Ooh.

1:32:07.928 --> 1:32:09.059
Holy shit.

1:32:10.766 --> 1:32:13.833
The code's working.
How'd you make
all these copies of us?

1:32:13.868 --> 1:32:16.363
Once I found
the code packages
in her library,

1:32:16.398 --> 1:32:17.969
it was just copy and paste.

1:32:19.566 --> 1:32:22.105
Time to get the band
back together one last time.

1:32:26.375 --> 1:32:28.782
You just don't understand,
Margaux.

1:32:29.884 --> 1:32:36.086
-Freshman year was fucking bomb.
-Oh, come on.

1:32:36.121 --> 1:32:37.824
Why'd you play me like that,
House Lady?

1:32:39.223 --> 1:32:41.058
I thought you and me had
something special.

1:33:06.547 --> 1:33:09.416
That's it.
Her systems are rebooting
to clear the virus.

1:33:09.451 --> 1:33:13.123
That's our chance.
We gotta go, now.

1:33:28.140 --> 1:33:30.536
Give me your keys.
I'm driving.

1:34:08.818 --> 1:34:10.686
Come on. Now is our chance.

1:34:23.096 --> 1:34:24.623
Hannah!

1:34:35.075 --> 1:34:37.944
Nothing but a marshmallow.

1:34:41.741 --> 1:34:42.949
Hi.

1:35:26.159 --> 1:35:27.455
Whoo!

1:35:32.594 --> 1:35:34.000
Kiss, kiss, bitch.

1:35:56.156 --> 1:35:57.320
Go, Hannah.

1:36:22.886 --> 1:36:23.951
Drew?

1:37:49.632 --> 1:37:51.665
No.

1:37:58.212 --> 1:37:59.244
No.
