01:04.824 --> 01:06.824
The story so far.

01:06.824 --> 01:09.540
We've seen an old enemy
bring Becky down.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.382
Better luck in your next life.

01:11.384 --> 01:14.820
And we've seen a new friend
raise her up until... Dear.

01:14.822 --> 01:18.824
Becky's secret marriage made
rich aunt Matilda rather cross.

01:18.824 --> 01:21.638
Treasure hunter. Revolutionary.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.824
Our second wedding
united a pair of lovers

01:23.824 --> 01:25.824
in defiance of both their families.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.824
I will do as my honour demands.

01:27.824 --> 01:31.824
And four happy honeymooners
left one lonely hero behind.

01:31.824 --> 01:35.824
Tonight, Becky finds
a new use for old friends,

01:35.824 --> 01:37.824
and why not?

01:37.830 --> 01:41.463
This is Vanity Fair, a world
where everyone is striving

01:41.824 --> 01:44.195
for what is not worth having.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.504
Shout when you need me.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.824
What I need is a valet.

02:19.824 --> 02:23.504
In our temporary embarrassment
in the financing of servants...

02:23.504 --> 02:25.824
And grocers and landlords. Damn it.

02:28.024 --> 02:30.344
You'll just have
to make do with me.

02:35.824 --> 02:38.824
Maybe I'll leave tomorrow instead.

02:38.824 --> 02:40.864
Tomorrow the rent collector comes
and we can't pay him.

02:40.864 --> 02:43.824
Darling, you rather urgently
need to make some money,

02:43.824 --> 02:46.824
because if I'm to be a camp follower
on a glorious battlefield...

02:46.824 --> 02:48.824
Officers do not have camp followers.

02:48.824 --> 02:50.824
If I'm going to be an officer's wife

02:50.824 --> 02:52.864
drinking fine wine
in crystal goblets,

02:52.864 --> 02:56.824
either way, I must have
pretty underthings.

03:00.824 --> 03:03.024
How shall I concentrate
on soldiering?

03:15.824 --> 03:17.824
Coast is clear.
No angry rent collectors,

03:17.824 --> 03:21.864
no disappointed grocers.
Routed by superior forces.

03:45.824 --> 03:47.824
Shall I take Mr George's plate, sir?

03:48.864 --> 03:52.824
Take it away...
and lay it again tomorrow.

03:52.824 --> 03:54.824
And every day.

03:55.824 --> 03:57.824
Till the damn fool runs out of money

03:57.824 --> 03:59.824
and comes crawling back.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.824
Father...

04:01.824 --> 04:04.824
please don't let my brother
go to war unforgiven.

04:04.824 --> 04:07.824
I have nothing to apologise for.

04:10.024 --> 04:11.824
Why should I say sorry to him?

04:11.824 --> 04:13.824
Because Napoleon will be upon us

04:13.824 --> 04:15.824
horse and foot
before three weeks are over,

04:15.824 --> 04:17.824
and give us such a dance as to make

04:17.824 --> 04:19.824
the war up until now
seem like child's play.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.344
We are only going
to Brussels, Dobbin.

04:22.344 --> 04:24.864
Famously full of fine people
and ladies of fashion.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.824
Well, I hope
you will represent our destination

04:27.824 --> 04:30.664
in that kindly light to Mrs Osborne.

04:30.664 --> 04:32.824
Amelia will enjoy the party.

04:32.824 --> 04:34.824
Half of London society
is already there.

04:34.824 --> 04:37.824
Dobbin...it's an adventure.

04:37.824 --> 04:39.824
Smile.

04:44.824 --> 04:46.344
Now, what's this, crybaby?

04:46.344 --> 04:49.824
I'm...I'm just writing
a letter to my mother, sir.

04:49.824 --> 04:51.824
Gad.

04:53.664 --> 04:55.824
The poor lady
is just so damned kind to me.

04:55.824 --> 04:57.824
Now, you be a good soldier,
Ensign Stubble.

04:57.824 --> 04:59.824
Just think, sir,

05:00.824 --> 05:02.824
all the men here, sir,

05:02.824 --> 05:05.824
all their mothers
and all their sweethearts...

05:07.824 --> 05:09.824
..how many of us will come home
again?

05:17.664 --> 05:19.824
Make her proud.

05:37.824 --> 05:40.824
I could not leave England
without coming here,

05:40.824 --> 05:44.864
without taking...
possibly my last chance

05:44.864 --> 05:49.824
of saying something to you
of truly vital importance

05:49.824 --> 05:51.824
for myself and...

05:51.824 --> 05:54.824
and-and I hope, Miss Osborne,
for you, too.

06:02.824 --> 06:05.824
Captain Dobbin, I'm quite overcome.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.864
God. No, I'm so sorry.

06:08.864 --> 06:11.024
I...

06:11.024 --> 06:13.824
I've failed to make myself clear.

06:13.824 --> 06:17.024
I've come with someone else's
happiness in mind, not my own.

06:17.024 --> 06:20.824
Captain Dobbin.
Off to war, is it?

06:20.824 --> 06:23.824
Show them all we are not afraid
of any damned Frenchman, what.

06:25.824 --> 06:28.664
Is the quarrel of my making?

06:28.664 --> 06:31.824
What did I ever seek but his good?

06:33.824 --> 06:37.344
For which I've been toiling like
a convict since the day he was born.

06:37.344 --> 06:40.824
Still, should anything
happen to him, I think...

06:40.824 --> 06:42.824
I think
you would never forgive yourself

06:42.824 --> 06:44.824
if you hadn't parted in charity.

06:44.824 --> 06:47.824
George has had three times
as much money from me

06:47.824 --> 06:49.824
as I warrant
your father ever gave you.

06:49.824 --> 06:52.824
My father was a grocer, sir,

06:52.824 --> 06:54.824
and I a scholarship boy.

06:54.824 --> 06:57.824
And he never found you
a West Indian bride

06:57.824 --> 07:00.184
to keep you in wealth
all your long days.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.664
I am a self-made man,

07:05.664 --> 07:07.824
but I raised my son a gentleman.

07:07.824 --> 07:09.824
And he repays me

07:09.824 --> 07:11.824
by marrying in the gutter.

07:11.824 --> 07:14.824
Mrs Osborne
is the best creature in the world.

07:14.824 --> 07:17.864
And no man shall insult her
in my presence.

07:22.864 --> 07:25.824
Pistols at dawn, is it?

07:28.824 --> 07:30.824
Good work, Captain Dobbin.

07:30.824 --> 07:33.824
I hope you can live with yourself.

07:52.824 --> 07:54.824
In a few days we'll set sail

07:54.824 --> 07:56.824
and nobody is going to send bailiffs
all the way to Belgium.

07:56.824 --> 08:00.824
I might if some scallywag
owed me three months' rent.

08:00.824 --> 08:03.824
But in the grand scheme of things,

08:03.824 --> 08:05.864
our little debts are nothing.

08:05.864 --> 08:08.024
There's a grand scheme of things.

08:08.024 --> 08:09.824
Some of the men marching today

08:09.824 --> 08:12.824
have been fighting this war
for more than 20 years.

08:13.824 --> 08:15.864
Survivors like you.

08:17.344 --> 08:19.824
Someone has to win,
and why shouldn't it be us?

08:19.824 --> 08:22.824
Do we not emerge the victors
from every challenge?

08:22.824 --> 08:25.024
How are we going to pay
for this hotel?

08:25.024 --> 08:28.824
All you have to do, my love,
for my plan to work out

08:28.824 --> 08:30.824
is play your cards right.

08:38.664 --> 08:39.823
Point of four.
Making.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.024
39.
Not good.

08:42.024 --> 08:44.183
I've got 40.

08:44.183 --> 08:48.824
I believe your Rawdon is widely
famed for his skills as a player.

08:50.824 --> 08:53.184
Everyone has to be good at
something.

08:54.824 --> 08:56.824
I think of it as
a useful way of keeping

08:56.824 --> 08:58.824
all foolish gentlemen
out of trouble.

09:01.344 --> 09:03.504
Becky,

09:03.504 --> 09:05.824
we leave all our troubles behind.

09:05.824 --> 09:07.824
Full house.

09:07.824 --> 09:10.824
I think that's a hundred down,
Osborne.

10:01.824 --> 10:03.824
And sway.

10:03.824 --> 10:05.824
And cast off.

10:05.824 --> 10:06.824
Right foot first.

10:06.824 --> 10:09.824
You never used to complain
about my dancing before.

10:11.824 --> 10:13.824
Come on.
No, no.

10:13.824 --> 10:15.824
No, no.

10:16.824 --> 10:19.344
Becky is always so lively.

10:19.344 --> 10:21.824
She has a light heart,
it's a good thing in a woman.

10:21.824 --> 10:24.824
You like her better now, I'm glad.

10:26.824 --> 10:28.824
Captain Dobbin,
we've missed you.

10:28.824 --> 10:31.824
Mrs Osborne,
very glad to have found you both.

10:32.824 --> 10:35.824
I have a letter from home
for George.

10:35.824 --> 10:37.824
Has the old monster relented?
Becky, shh.

10:37.824 --> 10:39.824
It's not father's handwriting,
it's odd.

10:41.824 --> 10:42.824
It's from his lawyer.

10:44.824 --> 10:46.824
"I am commissioned by Mr Osborne

10:46.824 --> 10:48.824
"to inform you
that in consequence of the marriage

10:48.824 --> 10:50.824
"which you have been
pleased to contract,

10:50.824 --> 10:52.824
"he ceases
to consider you henceforth

10:52.824 --> 10:54.824
"as a member of his family.

10:56.024 --> 10:58.184
"This determination is final and...

10:58.184 --> 11:00.504
"irrevocable...

11:01.824 --> 11:03.824
"..as is this settlement."

11:09.664 --> 11:11.824
£2,000.

11:12.824 --> 11:14.824
Dearest love.
This is all your fault.

11:14.824 --> 11:16.824
Don't speak to her like that.

11:16.824 --> 11:18.824
He means me, not Amelia.

11:18.824 --> 11:19.824
George!

11:19.824 --> 11:21.184
George.

11:21.184 --> 11:25.824
Is not £2,000
an immense deal of money?

11:25.824 --> 11:28.824
To a common foot soldier
it's a fortune.

11:30.344 --> 11:33.824
On and on at me, never shut up
until you had me married,

11:33.824 --> 11:35.824
and ruined, and now...

11:35.824 --> 11:38.824
I'm a beggar, and a married beggar,
too, and it's your fault.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.824
But you are still the luckiest man
in the world.

11:40.824 --> 11:42.864
How can you not see that?
He doesn't even write himself.

11:42.864 --> 11:45.024
He gets his lawyer to do it.

11:45.024 --> 11:46.824
And what the devil
am I to do with £2,000?

11:46.824 --> 11:49.824
I lost £140
to Rawdon Crawley yesterday.

11:49.824 --> 11:52.184
Well, George, I imagine
you'll have to live on your pay.

11:52.184 --> 11:54.824
How can a man like me do that?

11:54.824 --> 11:57.824
How am I supposed to keep up
my position in the world?

11:57.824 --> 11:59.824
And, no, do not say
I could live as you do,

11:59.824 --> 12:01.824
with no fun and no entertainment.

12:01.824 --> 12:04.824
Or do you want my wife
to take in soldiers' washing?

12:04.824 --> 12:06.824
Control yourself, George.
She's here.

12:10.824 --> 12:13.024
She's cost me dearer
than I ever imagined, Dobbin.

12:16.824 --> 12:19.824
A fine manager of a gentleman's
affairs you've turned out to be.

12:23.824 --> 12:25.824
Darling?
All is well. Yeah.

12:37.344 --> 12:38.824
They'll set sail tomorrow
so the minute

12:38.824 --> 12:41.824
you set eyes on Captain Osborne
in the morning

12:41.824 --> 12:44.664
make sure to ask him for the money
before he gets on that boat.

12:46.024 --> 12:48.344
Ship, not boat.

12:50.344 --> 12:53.344
I correct you
and you don't like it?

12:53.344 --> 12:54.864
Nonsense, I love it, just...

12:54.864 --> 12:57.024
don't make a habit of it.

12:58.824 --> 13:00.824
So, what's our plan?

13:00.824 --> 13:02.824
Once we get to Belgium,

13:02.824 --> 13:04.824
I'm going to look for
new gaming partners for you.

13:05.824 --> 13:08.344
Very good.
And new friends.

13:08.344 --> 13:10.824
Useful people
with more reliable pockets

13:10.824 --> 13:12.824
who are generally just...
less annoying.

13:14.824 --> 13:16.824
In your spare time, Becks,

13:16.824 --> 13:19.824
can you also win us the war?

13:20.824 --> 13:22.824
Do you doubt it?

13:58.266 --> 14:01.266
Non, that is trop cher, madame,
trop...

14:01.266 --> 14:03.266
much money.
Tant pis.

14:03.266 --> 14:05.266
I wish Becky were here.

14:05.266 --> 14:07.266
She'd know how to make
a pretty bargain.

14:07.266 --> 14:09.266
I hope she joins us soon.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.106
If you want female company
even on our honeymoon,

14:12.106 --> 14:14.266
your wish has sadly come true.

14:14.266 --> 14:17.266
Sure, it's Captain Osborne,
and this...

14:17.266 --> 14:19.266
your new lady wife?

14:19.266 --> 14:22.266
Amelia, may I present
Major O'Dowd of ours.

14:22.266 --> 14:24.266
And his lady wife,
which is to say me,

14:24.266 --> 14:26.266
Peggy O'Dowd of Glenmaloney.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.266
And now, shoo, Major O'Dowd,

14:28.266 --> 14:31.266
and you, too, Captain Osborne.

14:31.266 --> 14:33.266
Away to the mess wit' you now. Men!

14:33.266 --> 14:35.266
Always in the way.

14:37.266 --> 14:40.266
Would you ever think
there was a war on, Mrs Osborne?

14:40.266 --> 14:42.266
To see all these flowers.

14:42.266 --> 14:45.466
So many soldiers, Mrs O'Dowd.
Lord love 'em.

14:45.466 --> 14:49.266
Does your husband expect
an actual battle very soon?

14:49.266 --> 14:52.266
Now, we are army wives, my dear.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.626
Our sacred duty
is to keep our men cheerful

14:54.626 --> 14:58.266
and try not to think about all that
till the last minute.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.266
Look around you, Amelia.

15:17.266 --> 15:19.786
Observe the quality,
these are exactly the sort of people

15:19.786 --> 15:21.946
we should be moving amongst.

15:21.946 --> 15:24.266
Such an opportunity to shine.

15:25.266 --> 15:27.266
My Lady Bareacres,

15:27.266 --> 15:30.106
how marvellous it is to see you
and how charming you look.

15:30.106 --> 15:32.266
Do I know this young man?

15:32.266 --> 15:34.266
Captain Osborne, Mama.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.266
Famous for flirting.

15:36.266 --> 15:38.266
Flirting, gambling,

15:38.266 --> 15:40.266
charming all the ladies

15:40.266 --> 15:43.266
and riding into war
with the King's army,

15:43.266 --> 15:45.266
at your service, my lady.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.266
Faintly delicious whiskers.

15:48.266 --> 15:50.266
Inferior regiment.

15:50.266 --> 15:52.266
And married.

15:54.306 --> 15:56.266
Fading already.

16:01.266 --> 16:03.266
That is the quality?
I shall invite them to dinner.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.266
No.

16:05.266 --> 16:06.306
Why the great ladies of quality

16:06.306 --> 16:09.266
should leave your pretty side
for that ugly owd fellow...

16:09.266 --> 16:12.266
That is General Tufto
of the Household Cavalry.

16:12.266 --> 16:14.786
I do know that, young man.

16:14.786 --> 16:16.946
Does he have me for an utter fool?

16:16.946 --> 16:19.466
Ach, no, Peggy.
And there's his aide-de-camp.

16:21.266 --> 16:24.266
Thank heavens.
That means Becky must have arrived.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.306
Gentlemen.

16:40.306 --> 16:43.266
My dear Mrs Crawley.

16:43.266 --> 16:45.266
Mon generale.

16:45.266 --> 16:47.266
You naughty man.

16:47.266 --> 16:51.266
For the prettiest lady
in the regiment, Crawley?

16:51.266 --> 16:52.946
You lucky devil.

16:52.946 --> 16:55.266
Famous frontal development.

17:06.266 --> 17:08.266
She is changed.

17:08.266 --> 17:11.266
George, how beautiful she looks.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.626
All the other ladies have a bouquet.

17:15.626 --> 17:17.465
Emmy, why didn't you have a bouquet?

17:17.465 --> 17:19.626
Might that be
because you didn't buy her one?

17:19.626 --> 17:21.306
Would you stand down, old girl?

18:33.266 --> 18:35.306
I shall be quite safe, darling.

18:42.266 --> 18:44.266
At last we are alone, Mrs Crawley.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.266
Enter.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.466
Captain George.

18:58.466 --> 19:01.266
So nice of you to join us.

19:05.266 --> 19:08.266
The general and I were rather
moping in here, all alone.

19:08.266 --> 19:10.266
Infantryman?
Yes, sir.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.266
Hmph.
Excuse me.

19:15.266 --> 19:17.266
She's my dearest friend.

19:18.946 --> 19:21.266
No better than she should be.

19:23.306 --> 19:25.466
Dear me, what an old fool.

19:25.466 --> 19:28.266
Thank you for being
my knight in shining armour.

19:30.266 --> 19:33.106
Mrs Crawley, you look ravishing.

19:34.266 --> 19:36.786
All eyes are on you tonight.

19:36.786 --> 19:38.946
Then all eyes are blind,

19:38.946 --> 19:43.266
for there is not a woman in Belgium
prettier than your lady wife.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.266
I don't know
where everyone gets this idea

19:45.266 --> 19:47.266
that I don't appreciate her.

19:47.266 --> 19:49.266
She is a treasure,

19:49.266 --> 19:51.266
and you, naughty man,

19:51.266 --> 19:53.266
are not worthy of her.

19:55.266 --> 19:57.266
Bring her to me
and I'll tell her myself.

20:03.266 --> 20:05.266
Come tomorrow.

20:05.266 --> 20:08.626
You may get revenge for that 140.

20:12.266 --> 20:14.266
Indeed.

20:38.626 --> 20:40.786
Please.

20:40.786 --> 20:43.266
Imagine, Amelia,

20:43.266 --> 20:46.266
our general dines this evening
with the Duke of Wellington.

20:46.266 --> 20:48.266
He is honoured.

20:48.266 --> 20:51.266
The commander-in-chief gives
at least four grand dinners a week.

20:51.266 --> 20:53.266
He ordered an entire wagon
of silver plate from London,

20:53.266 --> 20:56.266
and every day is seen in the park
with a different lady on his arm.

20:56.266 --> 20:59.266
He makes very sure we can all see
that no Englishman

20:59.266 --> 21:01.266
shall lose a wink of sleep
over a little Corsican.

21:05.266 --> 21:08.266
I'm told the French
have crossed the frontier.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.626
That's more than anyone's told me.

21:10.626 --> 21:14.266
Though I am only an officer,
whereas you...

21:14.266 --> 21:16.266
Whereas we are on the staff

21:16.266 --> 21:18.306
and General Tufto is a great flirt
of mine, isn't he, Rawdon?

21:18.306 --> 21:22.266
Shame he doesn't play,
for he is made of money.

21:22.266 --> 21:25.266
Come on, Osborne,
wipe the floor with me.

21:30.106 --> 21:33.466
Becky, where are his rooms,
the general's rooms, I mean.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.306
Next to ours, of course.

21:35.306 --> 21:37.466
Rawdon is his aide-de-camp.

21:39.266 --> 21:41.266
So close? Won't people talk?

21:42.266 --> 21:46.266
My dear little creature, how can we,
with our means, live at all

21:46.266 --> 21:48.266
but for a friend to share expenses?

21:50.266 --> 21:51.266
Well...

21:53.946 --> 21:55.106
What?

21:56.266 --> 21:59.266
Do you suppose Rawdon is not big
enough to take care of my honour?

21:59.266 --> 22:01.266
No.

22:03.266 --> 22:05.266
I did not mean to cause offence.

22:07.266 --> 22:09.266
None is taken.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.266
I'm sorry.

22:11.266 --> 22:14.786
I do find having to be charming
and flirt all day and half the night

22:14.786 --> 22:17.266
gets rather wearing.

22:19.626 --> 22:22.266
Now, what are those
naughty men of ours up to?

22:24.266 --> 22:25.786
Point of four.
Good.

22:25.786 --> 22:27.946
I've got 40. Four points.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.266
May I light it for you?

22:33.266 --> 22:35.106
You're too kind.

22:41.266 --> 22:43.266
Lord, how I love that smell.

22:55.266 --> 22:56.266
Play on.

23:07.011 --> 23:10.051
Perhaps we should
raise a toast to new friendships?

23:14.256 --> 23:16.416
Enjoying your meringue,
Lady Bareacres?

23:17.337 --> 23:20.337
Meringue, my lord,
that's what it's supposed to be.

23:20.337 --> 23:21.337
Meringue?

23:22.537 --> 23:25.537
Mama, my digestion
is possibly too refined

23:25.537 --> 23:27.857
for le continent.

23:27.857 --> 23:30.337
It's probably not le continent
that is at fault, darling.

23:30.337 --> 23:32.337
But the societe.

23:32.337 --> 23:35.337
The society.

23:35.337 --> 23:37.337
And how brilliant it is.

23:37.337 --> 23:39.337
And all on display tomorrow night.

23:39.337 --> 23:41.337
Lady Blanche,
I hope I shall have the pleasure

23:41.337 --> 23:44.017
of appearing on your card
more than once.

23:44.017 --> 23:46.177
Dance with you?

23:49.337 --> 23:51.377
As long as you save
the quadrille for me, George.

23:51.377 --> 23:54.337
Well, surely she's not invited?

23:59.337 --> 24:01.337
'How could they be so rude?'

24:01.337 --> 24:03.337
How can they think they are
so much better than us?

24:03.337 --> 24:04.857
Because they are better than us.

24:04.857 --> 24:06.337
They are Lord and Lady Bareacres.

24:06.337 --> 24:08.537
Their daughter is promised
to a duke of the blood.

24:08.537 --> 24:11.337
How much did last night cost us,
George?

24:15.337 --> 24:18.177
The trembling lip and the constantly
on the verge of tears,

24:18.177 --> 24:20.337
it's enough to drive a man mad.

24:20.337 --> 24:22.337
Why can't you be more like...
Like Becky?

24:23.337 --> 24:26.337
She lives off her wits,
as we must learn to do.

24:26.337 --> 24:29.537
You never liked her before she
learned to flirt and toss her hair.

24:29.537 --> 24:31.857
For God's sake.
Let us not quarrel.

24:31.857 --> 24:33.337
Please, God, let us not.

24:33.337 --> 24:35.377
George. George, please don't go.

24:42.337 --> 24:44.337
Sorry, sir.

24:50.017 --> 24:52.177
The flower, monsieur?

24:52.177 --> 24:54.337
Can I have those, please?

24:54.337 --> 24:56.337
Oui, bien sur.

24:57.337 --> 24:58.337
It's quite simple, darling.

24:58.337 --> 25:00.337
If I don't flirt with them,
they don't visit.

25:00.337 --> 25:03.337
If they don't visit, you don't play
and if you don't play, we starve.

25:03.337 --> 25:05.337
You're just a little too good at it,
Becks.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.337
Osborne has convinced himself
that you are in love with him.

25:09.377 --> 25:14.337
Captain Osborne,
so handsome, so dangerous,

25:14.337 --> 25:16.337
can I light you another cigar?

25:17.337 --> 25:21.337
If I shan't be
the finest lady at the ball,

25:21.337 --> 25:23.537
I shall be the most charming.

25:23.537 --> 25:25.337
So everyone will want to meet us

25:25.337 --> 25:27.337
and all the wealthy gentlemen
will want to play you

25:27.337 --> 25:29.337
and they will all have to form
an orderly queue

25:29.337 --> 25:31.537
with foolish George Osborne
firmly in the rear.

25:31.537 --> 25:34.337
Now, that is what I call a plan.

25:43.337 --> 25:47.337
Seems that the general
does not give up so easily.

25:54.857 --> 25:57.337
They're not from the general.

25:59.377 --> 26:02.337
They're from Captain George Osborne.

26:03.337 --> 26:06.337
Pfft!
Darling, no, I mean it.

26:06.337 --> 26:08.337
I mean it. Not if he were
the last man on earth.

26:33.337 --> 26:35.337
Non, non, Isidor. Careful, man.

26:53.337 --> 26:56.377
Mr Joseph!
How utterly delightful.

26:56.377 --> 26:58.537
Miss Sharp.

26:58.537 --> 27:02.337
My dear, are we going to a ball?
Do I have time to change?

27:02.337 --> 27:04.337
Isidor, careful.

27:04.337 --> 27:06.337
Merde! Idiot!

27:07.337 --> 27:10.337
It's Mrs Crawley now.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.337
This is my husband,
Captain Crawley of the Life Guards.

27:12.337 --> 27:16.337
Rawdon, may I introduce
Amelia's brother, Mr Sedley?

27:16.337 --> 27:19.857
You've had a truly dreadful journey,
you poor thing.

27:19.857 --> 27:22.337
Madam,
the collector of Boggley Wallah

27:22.337 --> 27:24.337
was not intended by his maker
for sea travel.

27:24.337 --> 27:26.337
But how could I miss the excitement?

27:26.337 --> 27:28.337
And how do I get a ticket?

27:28.337 --> 27:30.337
Hen's teeth, old boy, sorry.

27:30.337 --> 27:32.337
Mrs Crawley!

27:32.337 --> 27:34.337
General Tufto.

27:34.337 --> 27:36.337
Radiant.

27:36.337 --> 27:38.337
But poor show.

27:38.337 --> 27:41.337
The lady deserves better, Crawley.

27:42.337 --> 27:44.337
Gosh.

27:44.337 --> 27:46.337
This way, my dear.

27:53.337 --> 27:57.337
Gosh, are you going to have
to fight that man in a duel now?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.337
Moustaches
are strictly for soldiers.

28:01.337 --> 28:03.337
Continental soldiers.

28:03.337 --> 28:06.337
For God's sake, man, shave them off.

28:31.337 --> 28:34.177
Sorry.

28:34.177 --> 28:36.337
Sorry.

28:38.017 --> 28:40.177
I'm so sorry.

28:44.337 --> 28:47.337
My Lady Bareacres,
may I request a place on your card?

28:47.337 --> 28:49.337
Shall we?

28:51.337 --> 28:53.337
We needn't know them in England.

29:04.337 --> 29:07.537
General Tufto,
Captain Rawdon Crawley,

29:07.537 --> 29:09.697
and Mrs Crawley!

29:45.337 --> 29:48.337
You wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway,
Mick, you owd fool.

29:48.337 --> 29:50.337
Much happier in here

29:50.337 --> 29:52.377
writing your orders.

29:55.697 --> 29:58.337
There'll be such a ball
danced tomorrow

29:58.337 --> 30:00.537
as some of 'em
has never heard the tune of.

30:14.337 --> 30:17.337
Dearest,
why do you sit here all alone

30:17.337 --> 30:19.337
and dismally unhappy?

30:19.337 --> 30:21.337
Where's your naughty Captain George?

30:23.337 --> 30:26.337
Becky, I wish
our friendship was as before.

30:26.337 --> 30:29.337
Alas, we are married women now.

30:33.337 --> 30:35.017
George is very poor now...

30:35.017 --> 30:37.337
If you don't want George to gamble
with Rawdon, then just stop him.

30:37.337 --> 30:39.337
How can I? I promised to obey him.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.857
That stuff is just make-believe,
the things you say in church.

30:44.337 --> 30:46.337
Amelia, the days are gone
when it was possible

30:46.337 --> 30:48.337
for a woman to live
her whole life as a girl.

30:50.377 --> 30:52.337
I seek a partner for the waltz.

30:54.017 --> 30:56.337
Go on, Amelia,
please your husband.

31:04.337 --> 31:06.537
You are the dancer.

31:38.337 --> 31:40.337
He's so brave,

31:40.337 --> 31:43.337
so clever, so handsome.

31:43.337 --> 31:46.337
It's not his fault
I make him unhappy.

31:46.337 --> 31:48.337
No, no, don't say such things.

31:48.337 --> 31:50.337
I've cost him his father...

31:50.337 --> 31:52.337
and his fortune.

31:53.337 --> 31:55.337
Alas, Mrs Crawley is leaving.

31:57.697 --> 32:01.337
Everybody was looking at my wife.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.337
Everybody was dancing with my wife.

32:05.337 --> 32:07.337
But she shall dance home with you.

32:16.337 --> 32:18.337
What? When?

32:18.337 --> 32:21.337
You never used to like her at all.

32:21.337 --> 32:23.697
"Sharp by name, sharp by nature."

32:23.697 --> 32:25.857
Rebecca...

32:25.857 --> 32:28.017
Read it.

32:28.017 --> 32:30.337
I mean every word.

32:37.337 --> 32:39.337
William... May I call you William?

32:39.337 --> 32:42.337
You've always been very kind to me.
Please take me home.

32:48.017 --> 32:50.337
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

32:50.337 --> 32:52.337
it is my sorry duty
to have to tell you

32:52.337 --> 32:57.337
that Napoleon is reported
marching on Brussels.

32:59.337 --> 33:01.537
God save the King.
God save the King!

33:03.337 --> 33:05.337
All officers to report
to their regiments immediately.

33:05.337 --> 33:07.337
Battle begins.

33:14.648 --> 33:16.808
Come on, let's get you back to base.

33:19.808 --> 33:21.808
Sorry, sir.

33:21.808 --> 33:25.808
The Duke of Wellington himself
calls them the scum of the earth.

33:25.808 --> 33:27.808
But on the battlefield?
Lions.

33:28.808 --> 33:30.808
You will bring George home to me?

33:30.808 --> 33:32.808
For God knows,
I cannot live without him.

33:33.808 --> 33:35.008
I will.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.848
Let's get you inside.

33:38.848 --> 33:41.808
My double barrel,
let's say 40 guineas.

33:41.808 --> 33:44.808
My driving cloak, sable lining,
you'll get £50 for that.

33:44.808 --> 33:46.848
Duelling pistols.

33:46.848 --> 33:49.808
My two horses, down in the stables.

33:52.808 --> 33:54.808
Never fear.

33:54.808 --> 33:56.808
We're not done with your aunt yet.

33:56.808 --> 33:59.808
Come back a hero,

33:59.808 --> 34:01.808
and we'll rattle your medals
in her face.

34:01.808 --> 34:05.168
Dearest, I have calculated
my current worth at £600 or £700.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.808
Taking into account the jewellery
General Tufto has given me.

34:09.808 --> 34:12.808
I'm relieved to hear
that even now you have a plan.

34:12.808 --> 34:15.808
If the worst comes to the worst,
do not fear for me.

34:15.808 --> 34:18.808
I shall flatter Jos Sedley into
giving me a seat in his carriage.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.808
But when I'm leaving a wife
at home...

34:24.808 --> 34:26.808
..maybe somebody else, too...

34:28.808 --> 34:30.808
Good Lord, I hope not.

34:30.808 --> 34:34.808
..I should like
to provide for my family.

34:34.808 --> 34:36.808
As a gentleman.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.848
That is no laughing matter, Mrs C.

34:44.808 --> 34:46.808
Don't cry, little woman.

34:48.808 --> 34:50.808
I may live to vex you yet.

34:57.808 --> 34:59.328
I must go.

35:05.328 --> 35:07.808
You know,
I'm a thousand times happier,

35:07.808 --> 35:09.808
married to you...

35:09.808 --> 35:12.808
than I ever thought
I could be in this world.

35:38.648 --> 35:40.808
Let's go!

35:53.808 --> 35:55.808
Becky!

36:08.808 --> 36:10.648
Ooh.

36:18.488 --> 36:20.808
"Becky, you have captured my heart.

36:20.808 --> 36:23.488
"I know you feel the same.

36:23.488 --> 36:25.648
"We must be together.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.808
"Let us fly tonight.

36:27.808 --> 36:29.808
"Yours, George,"

36:47.328 --> 36:49.488
George!

36:49.488 --> 36:51.648
Don't drink any more.

36:51.648 --> 36:53.808
Drink? There's nothing like it.
Have some yourself.

36:53.808 --> 36:54.808
Loosen up that lantern jaw.

36:54.808 --> 36:57.808
The enemy has crossed the river.
Can you not hear the bugles?

36:57.808 --> 36:59.808
They're just drunk, the lot of them.

36:59.808 --> 37:02.648
Drunk or sober, they march
with us in three hours, George.

37:04.808 --> 37:06.808
Three hours?

37:09.808 --> 37:11.808
I confess, I never thought
it would actually happen.

37:11.808 --> 37:13.808
Well, it is happening!
It's happening now.

37:17.808 --> 37:18.808
Emmy.

37:19.808 --> 37:21.808
She's safe in your rooms.

37:24.168 --> 37:26.008
I'm leaving her with nothing.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.808
I have no money for her.
I've ruined her life and mine.

37:29.808 --> 37:31.808
I'm not fit to be a married man.
Go to her.

37:31.808 --> 37:33.808
Go to her.

37:33.808 --> 37:35.808
There's still time
to put things right.

37:38.808 --> 37:39.808
Yes.

38:14.808 --> 38:16.808
Thank you, Peggy.

38:16.808 --> 38:18.808
I've packed you a pint of brandy.

38:25.808 --> 38:28.808
All the years I've served
as an army wife...

38:29.808 --> 38:31.808
..and I've never got used to this.

38:56.808 --> 38:58.808
I don't deserve you.

39:02.488 --> 39:04.808
Please, just hold me close.

39:17.808 --> 39:18.808
We march in 15 minutes, Sedley,

39:18.808 --> 39:20.808
and neither George nor I
may ever come back.

39:20.808 --> 39:22.808
You'll be fine.
You are not to stir from this town,

39:22.808 --> 39:25.808
do you hear me? You will stay here
and watch over your sister,

39:25.808 --> 39:27.808
and see that no harm comes to her.
They're miles away.

39:27.808 --> 39:29.848
Jos, if anything should happen
to George, remember,

39:29.848 --> 39:33.008
she has no-one in the world but you.

39:33.008 --> 39:35.808
You'll see her safely out of
Brussels in the event of a defeat.

39:35.808 --> 39:37.808
Defeat? No, impossible.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.648
You're just trying
to frighten me now.

39:41.808 --> 39:43.808
I'm ready.

39:43.808 --> 39:46.168
dear, is she ill?

39:46.168 --> 39:48.328
Hurry, before she collapses again.

40:01.477 --> 40:03.477
So, here we are, boys.

40:03.477 --> 40:05.477
For crown and country.

40:21.477 --> 40:23.517
Halt!

40:58.369 --> 41:00.409
Gentlemen, shall we?

41:51.157 --> 41:53.477
Stuff and nonsense!
We are two to one, sir,

41:53.477 --> 41:55.477
against any force Boney
can bring into the field.

41:55.477 --> 41:57.677
The Prussians
were two to one at Jena,

41:57.677 --> 42:01.477
and Napoleon took their army
and their kingdom in a week.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.477
The Duke shall crush him.

42:03.477 --> 42:05.477
They say that Wellington
is fled already, my lord,

42:05.477 --> 42:09.477
and that his quarters got ready
for the Duke of Dalmatia.

42:09.477 --> 42:11.477
I have it from his own maitre-d.

42:13.477 --> 42:16.477
Rumours.
Get me my coat and cap, sir.

42:16.477 --> 42:18.517
I shall go out and learn the truth.

42:24.477 --> 42:26.477
Do it myself.

42:27.477 --> 42:29.477
Not in that military coat.

42:29.477 --> 42:31.477
You want to get caught by the French
and eaten?

42:35.517 --> 42:37.477
Gad.

42:37.477 --> 42:39.477
Are you joining the army, too,
Mr Jos?

42:39.477 --> 42:43.477
Is there to be nobody left in
Brussels to protect us poor women?

42:44.477 --> 42:46.477
I should like to see the action.

42:46.477 --> 42:48.477
Any man of any spirit would.

42:48.477 --> 42:50.477
You men.

42:50.477 --> 42:52.997
Parting and danger
are nothing to you.

42:52.997 --> 42:54.477
Captain Crawley left me this morning

42:54.477 --> 42:57.477
as gay as if he was going
to a hunting party.

43:05.477 --> 43:07.477
Admit it.

43:07.477 --> 43:11.477
You were going to join the army
and leave us to our fate.

43:12.477 --> 43:14.477
My dear madam,

43:14.477 --> 43:16.477
my duty keeps me here.

43:16.477 --> 43:19.477
I can't leave that poor creature,
my sister.

43:20.477 --> 43:22.517
I hope I, too,

43:22.517 --> 43:24.677
may appeal to you

43:24.677 --> 43:27.477
for comfort and for shelter...

43:30.677 --> 43:32.677
..when the time comes.

43:46.477 --> 43:48.477
I imagine you'll be the one
doing the looking after,

43:48.477 --> 43:50.477
as Jos is so hopeless.

43:52.477 --> 43:54.477
Why are you here, Rebecca?

43:54.477 --> 43:57.477
I came to see how you are.

44:00.477 --> 44:02.477
You don't love your husband.

44:04.477 --> 44:07.477
You would not stand there
with dry eyes if you did.

44:10.317 --> 44:11.477
Tell me.

44:12.477 --> 44:15.477
Did I ever do you
anything but kindness?

44:17.477 --> 44:19.477
Indeed no.
When you were poor...

44:20.477 --> 44:22.477
..who befriended you?

44:22.477 --> 44:24.477
You did.
Was I not...

44:24.477 --> 44:26.477
a sister to you?

44:28.477 --> 44:29.477
You were, but...

44:29.477 --> 44:32.477
Then who sent you to separate
those whom God has joined together?

44:32.477 --> 44:34.477
Amelia, I protest before God...

44:34.477 --> 44:36.477
His love was everything to me.

44:36.477 --> 44:38.477
You knew it.

44:38.477 --> 44:40.477
You wanted to rob me of it.

44:40.477 --> 44:42.477
For shame, Rebecca!

44:42.477 --> 44:46.477
Bad and wicked woman,
false friend and false wife!

44:47.477 --> 44:49.477
I have not betrayed my husband.

44:49.477 --> 44:52.477
Have you not betrayed me?

44:53.477 --> 44:56.477
What have I done to you that you
should try and take him from me?

44:56.477 --> 44:58.477
I did nothing to encourage him.

44:58.477 --> 45:00.477
I had him for six weeks.

45:00.477 --> 45:02.477
It was tomfoolery, it was vanity,

45:02.477 --> 45:05.317
you know how he prevented
my marriage to Jos.

45:05.317 --> 45:06.477
I couldn't resist playing him along,

45:06.477 --> 45:08.477
but nothing really happened,
I swear.

45:08.477 --> 45:10.477
Don't you dare sit there! Get up!

45:10.477 --> 45:12.477
We sat there.

45:12.477 --> 45:14.997
My husband and I.

45:14.997 --> 45:17.477
And I was on his knee,
and his arm around my neck,

45:17.477 --> 45:19.477
and we said
Our Father Who Art In Heaven,

45:19.477 --> 45:21.477
and they came and took him away.

45:21.477 --> 45:24.477
But he promised me to come back.

45:28.477 --> 45:30.477
He will come back, my dear.
Leave me.

45:31.997 --> 45:34.157
I cannot bear the sight of you.

45:55.477 --> 45:56.477
Mrs O'Dowd.

45:56.477 --> 46:01.477
Mrs O'Dowd, poor little Mrs Osborne
is in a desperate condition.

46:01.477 --> 46:04.157
I've cares of my own enough today.
She's mad with grief.

46:04.157 --> 46:06.317
What, she doesn't want you?

46:06.317 --> 46:08.477
Who used to be so fond of her. No.

46:11.477 --> 46:13.477
Dear God, already.

46:13.477 --> 46:15.477
What is it?
Heaven defend us from all fools,

46:15.477 --> 46:17.517
it's cannon fire.

46:19.317 --> 46:20.477
God in heaven,

46:20.916 --> 46:23.675
please bring our menfolk safe home.
