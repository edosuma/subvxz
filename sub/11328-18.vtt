WEBVTT

00:03.051 --> 00:06.186
Why do you want the condom? I thought it
would be nice to have a condom in my purse

00:06.220 --> 00:09.089
like any other responsible
teenager going out on a date.

00:09.123 --> 00:11.191
Take it to her. How many
times can I drive up there

00:11.225 --> 00:12.392
just to get rejected?

00:12.427 --> 00:13.960
As many times as it takes.

00:13.995 --> 00:15.128
You still have feelings for Ricky?

00:15.163 --> 00:16.596
No. What about Ben?

00:16.631 --> 00:18.532
Nope. Did you have sex with him?

00:18.566 --> 00:19.533
No.

00:19.567 --> 00:20.867
Wow. Wow what?

00:20.902 --> 00:22.936
Griffin was right. I think I might like you.

00:22.970 --> 00:25.472
Ben, come in.

00:25.506 --> 00:26.807
I want to get married.

00:26.841 --> 00:28.041
Me, too.

00:28.076 --> 00:29.109
I never slept with her.

00:29.143 --> 00:31.278
You slept with her in Chicago. I did not.

00:34.916 --> 00:37.584
Some guy outside said to give this to you.

00:37.618 --> 00:39.486
Why did he not bring in my purse?

00:41.422 --> 00:44.224
If you're going to be with Madison,
Jack, just be with Madison,

00:44.258 --> 00:46.126
because nobody respects a cheater.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.461
We could have been good together.

00:47.495 --> 00:49.162
I'm not taking the job in New York.

00:49.197 --> 00:52.099
Because we're getting married.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.568
Oh, my God! Mom!

00:54.602 --> 00:56.837
So you're back?

00:56.871 --> 00:58.738
I was thinking about it, but I don't think

00:58.773 --> 01:00.774
that it's a good time for me to come back.

01:04.212 --> 01:06.313
She's home, but she's not staying

01:06.347 --> 01:08.515
unless Dad agrees to go to counseling.

01:08.549 --> 01:10.183
Well, that sounds reasonable.

01:10.218 --> 01:13.520
Are you kidding? Mr.
Juergens in a shrink's office?

01:13.554 --> 01:15.422
That's not happening, is it, Amy?

01:15.456 --> 01:17.858
I thought maybe it was until you said that.

01:18.893 --> 01:22.129
So, um, did he call you? Jimmy?

01:22.163 --> 01:25.165
No, but we agreed we're not going
to call each other every day.

01:25.199 --> 01:26.700
We're two hours apart,

01:26.734 --> 01:29.169
and you know how lon
g-distance relationships are.

01:29.203 --> 01:30.303
They just don't work.

01:31.372 --> 01:32.606
So he hasn't called?

01:32.640 --> 01:33.773
Has Jesse called you?

01:33.808 --> 01:38.178
Oh, yeah. Every two hours.

01:38.212 --> 01:40.514
Jack calls me.
You know, not every two hours,

01:40.548 --> 01:43.183
but every day.

01:43.217 --> 01:45.352
But we're not in a lon
g-distance relationship.

01:45.386 --> 01:47.254
Are you in a relationship?

01:47.288 --> 01:48.855
You know what they're doing.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.991
So yes. Madison.

01:51.025 --> 01:52.859
Look, it's not that bad.

01:52.894 --> 01:55.529
I like it for now.

01:55.563 --> 01:57.497
Are you doing anything with Jimmy?

01:57.532 --> 01:59.199
No, not really.

01:59.233 --> 02:01.368
We did make out for a couple of hours.

02:01.402 --> 02:04.471
And he didn't call you? Okay, that's weird.

02:04.505 --> 02:05.872
Is he a bad kisser?

02:05.907 --> 02:07.040
No.

02:07.074 --> 02:09.142
Uh-oh.

02:09.176 --> 02:10.243
What?

02:10.277 --> 02:11.978
Nothing. Madison...

02:12.013 --> 02:13.813
I am not a bad kisser.

02:13.848 --> 02:16.750
If I were a bad kisser,
we wouldn't have made out for two hours.

02:16.784 --> 02:18.518
Maybe he was trying to teach you something.

02:18.553 --> 02:19.653
Did he seem bored?

02:19.687 --> 02:21.655
No.

02:26.527 --> 02:27.827
I can't believe he didn't call her.

02:27.862 --> 02:29.362
Something's wrong.

02:30.364 --> 02:31.998
Hey, girlfriend. Did he call?

02:32.033 --> 02:33.833
No, he did not call.

02:33.868 --> 02:35.302
He does not have to call me.

02:35.336 --> 02:37.170
He can call me if he feels like calling me.

02:37.205 --> 02:39.839
Yeah, that's right. Or you can
call him if you feel like calling--

02:39.874 --> 02:41.508
I don't feel like calling him.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.510
Oh, right. There's a lot
going on at your house.

02:43.544 --> 02:44.544
Goodbye, Adrian.

02:46.214 --> 02:47.581
Oh, hey. Good morning.

02:47.615 --> 02:49.883
Yeah, I'll see you later.

02:49.917 --> 02:52.185
Wait, did you ask them?

02:52.220 --> 02:54.521
Did you ask your parents to
come over and meet my parents?

02:54.555 --> 02:57.190
They can do it any time.
Well, any time my mom's not working.

02:57.225 --> 02:59.025
No, I didn't get a chance.

02:59.060 --> 03:00.427
Oh, come on. Please?

03:00.461 --> 03:01.962
Adrian, my mom does not like the fact

03:01.996 --> 03:04.564
that I moved out of the house
and you and I are having sex.

03:04.599 --> 03:05.832
That doesn't mean they won't like me.

03:05.866 --> 03:07.033
Yes, it does.

03:07.068 --> 03:09.703
Look, my parents want to meet your parents.

03:09.737 --> 03:11.805
Why? Your parents are getting married.
We're not getting married.

03:11.839 --> 03:13.673
I have to go. I'll talk to you later.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.486 --> 03:27.621
Hey.

03:30.491 --> 03:31.558
What's wrong?

03:33.828 --> 03:34.928
Your parents?

03:34.962 --> 03:36.496
No.

03:36.530 --> 03:38.565
Well, yeah. That too.

03:40.701 --> 03:42.402
You think I'm a good kisser?

03:42.436 --> 03:43.903
Why do you ask?

03:43.938 --> 03:45.839
Couldn't you have just said yes?

03:45.873 --> 03:47.574
Of course you're a good kisser.

03:48.943 --> 03:51.411
Oh, geez. He didn't call you?

03:52.413 --> 03:53.680
No.

03:53.714 --> 03:55.515
It's not because you're not a good kisser.

03:55.549 --> 03:57.851
Everyone's a good kisser.

03:59.453 --> 04:01.721
Of course, anyone could become
a better kisser with practice.

04:01.756 --> 04:03.023
Is that true?

04:03.057 --> 04:05.225
Doesn't everything get better with practice?

04:05.259 --> 04:08.295
I don't know.

04:08.329 --> 04:09.729
You want to practice?

04:10.998 --> 04:12.799
I could practice with you.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.368
You know, just as a friend.

04:15.403 --> 04:19.139
Really, after everything
we've been through together,

04:19.173 --> 04:21.641
we can't kiss each other just
so you can get some practice?

04:23.311 --> 04:26.479
I'm sure you didn't learn anything from Ben,

04:26.514 --> 04:28.248
other than maybe some bad habits.

04:28.282 --> 04:30.150
Think about it.

04:30.184 --> 04:33.486
I'm coming by to see John tonight anyway,

04:33.521 --> 04:36.356
and no one has to know.

04:43.197 --> 04:45.598
<i>* Falling in love *</i>

04:45.633 --> 04:48.868
<i>* Is such an easy thing to do *</i>

04:48.903 --> 04:51.504
<i>* Birds can do it We can do it *</i>

04:51.539 --> 04:54.040
<i>* Let's stop talking
Let's get to it *</i>

04:54.075 --> 04:56.242
<i>* Let's fall in love *</i>

05:04.085 --> 05:05.785
I need a late slip. I'm late.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.155
I noticed. What's going on?
Could I just have a late slip?

05:09.190 --> 05:10.924
You never get something for nothing.
Tell me what's going on.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.258
What is that?

05:12.293 --> 05:13.727
It's a poster. I made it myself.

05:13.761 --> 05:15.228
It's for the Mother Daughter Dance.

05:15.262 --> 05:17.464
It's sort of a ritual I like
to do in the springtime.

05:17.498 --> 05:19.466
We always have a father-daughter dance.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.234
I know there's usually a fathe
r-daughter dance,

05:21.268 --> 05:22.702
but mother-daughter dances

05:22.737 --> 05:25.171
are always interesting and usually fun.

05:25.206 --> 05:28.608
I started switching our dads with moms,
oh, I don't know, years--

05:28.642 --> 05:30.410
Can I just have a late slip? Maybe.

05:30.444 --> 05:32.412
Something going on with your mom?
The new boyfriend?

05:32.446 --> 05:33.913
He's not a boyfriend.

05:33.948 --> 05:36.416
He's just some younger man
she's seeing to embarrass me.

05:36.450 --> 05:38.184
Her husband, my father,

05:38.219 --> 05:39.953
hasn't even been dead for a year.

05:39.987 --> 05:42.288
It's a year of mourning
with the Protestants?

05:42.323 --> 05:44.090
I don't think there's any rule.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.993
Oh. So it just hurts?

05:48.562 --> 05:50.029
Life is for the living.

05:50.064 --> 05:51.664
Not without respect for the dead.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.100
That's kind of what this is abou
t- the Mother Daughter Dance.

05:54.135 --> 05:55.268
I don't know what that means,

05:55.302 --> 05:57.103
but I don't want to be a participant in it.

05:57.138 --> 05:58.605
I don't want to dance with my mother.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.173
I don't even want to be around my mother.

06:00.207 --> 06:01.708
Yes, but you could be with your mother

06:01.742 --> 06:04.043
instead of with a guy or your friends

06:04.078 --> 06:05.378
or one of your friends' mothers

06:05.413 --> 06:07.380
who you may like better
than your own at this age.

06:07.415 --> 06:09.149
That's why I do this every year.

06:09.183 --> 06:11.050
Forget about the late slip.
I'll just write it myself.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.754
You're still going to need me to sign it.

06:18.092 --> 06:20.059
Hello.

06:20.094 --> 06:21.194
We need to talk.

06:21.228 --> 06:23.062
About? This Mother Daughter Dance.

06:23.097 --> 06:26.866
You know, some of us don't have mothers.

06:26.901 --> 06:28.168
I know.

06:28.202 --> 06:31.404
Yeah, and it's wrong. It's just wrong.

06:31.439 --> 06:32.839
It's awkward for me

06:32.873 --> 06:35.074
and for anyone else who's lost a mother

06:35.109 --> 06:40.880
to death or divorce or career or whatever.

06:40.915 --> 06:42.081
Your mom passed away?

06:42.116 --> 06:43.216
Yeah. Five years ago.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.384
Did your dad remarry?

06:44.418 --> 06:45.652
What does that have to do with anything?

06:45.686 --> 06:46.653
She's not my mother.

06:46.687 --> 06:47.887
What's her name?

06:47.922 --> 06:49.589
I call her my wicked stepmother.

06:49.623 --> 06:51.524
He calls her Emily.

06:51.559 --> 06:52.859
I don't want to dance with her.

06:52.893 --> 06:54.894
Bad dancer? Bad everything.

06:54.929 --> 06:57.764
Yeah, I don't do anything with her, ever,

06:57.798 --> 06:59.265
so I don't want to start now.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.500
So you're close?

07:00.534 --> 07:01.734
Are you mocking me?

07:01.769 --> 07:04.037
Just testing your sense of humor about this.

07:04.071 --> 07:05.538
I figured if you're in
the Dead Parents Club,

07:05.573 --> 07:06.840
you must have a sense of humor.

07:06.874 --> 07:10.210
How long has your dad been married to her?

07:10.244 --> 07:11.377
Three years.

07:11.412 --> 07:13.713
And they dated a year before that.

07:13.747 --> 07:15.715
Just a year after my mom died.

07:15.749 --> 07:17.050
At least, I think it was a year.

07:17.084 --> 07:18.751
They could have been going out longer.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.054
Might be time for you to
get to know each other.

07:21.088 --> 07:22.388
My father and I have an agreement--

07:22.423 --> 07:24.991
I don't have to know her,
as long as I'm not rude.

07:25.025 --> 07:26.192
Tell me about her.

07:26.227 --> 07:27.560
She flirted with my dad,

07:27.595 --> 07:30.063
and she conned him into marrying her,

07:30.097 --> 07:34.701
and then she took over everything
in the house and she ruined my life.

07:34.735 --> 07:37.070
Oh, I don't think I'd let
anyone have that kind of power--

07:37.104 --> 07:38.605
power to ruin my life.

07:38.639 --> 07:40.874
Didn't that kid you went to
the dance with ruin your life?

07:40.908 --> 07:44.077
I made the decision to go,
and it didn't ruin my life.

07:44.111 --> 07:46.145
And it made his better.

07:46.180 --> 07:47.981
Why are you always dancing?

07:48.015 --> 07:50.416
Like I've said, life is for the living.

07:50.451 --> 07:51.918
Dancing is living.

07:51.952 --> 07:53.586
It's a celebration of life.

07:53.621 --> 07:54.754
I'm celebrating.

07:54.788 --> 07:56.122
Well, I'm not celebrating.

07:56.156 --> 07:58.091
Okay, suit yourself. It's just a dance.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.125
It's not a requirement.

07:59.159 --> 08:02.996
But why don't you tell me--

08:03.030 --> 08:05.298
What's really going on here?

08:05.332 --> 08:09.802
Wow. Where were you trained?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.804
I went to undergraduate school in France.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.406
That's where I really honed my skills.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.376
The advanced degree from an American
university was just a requirement.

08:16.410 --> 08:17.844
I'd offer you wine and a cigarette,

08:17.878 --> 08:19.245
but it's not good for you.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.513
Hi.

08:20.548 --> 08:22.015
Hello. Is everything okay?

08:22.049 --> 08:24.717
She didn't come back from the bathroom.

08:24.752 --> 08:27.687
We have bathroom passes, so Ms. Johnson
sent me to find out if she was okay.

08:27.721 --> 08:30.356
I'm okay. Chocolate?

08:30.391 --> 08:32.558
Is it a bribe? Because I'm not
going to that dance, either.

08:32.592 --> 08:33.993
Because?

08:34.028 --> 08:36.062
Because my mom and dad are divorced,

08:36.096 --> 08:37.730
and my dad would be totally jealous

08:37.765 --> 08:39.899
if I spent any more time with my mom.

08:39.933 --> 08:41.400
I already live with her and her husband,

08:41.434 --> 08:44.070
so I can't have some special night with her.

08:44.104 --> 08:46.072
She's already getting me and
my brother for spring break,

08:46.106 --> 08:48.608
so this would totally
put my dad over the top.

08:48.642 --> 08:51.411
Your dad, the psychologist slash
family counselor extraordinaire

08:51.445 --> 08:52.445
and best-selling author?

08:52.479 --> 08:54.080
Best-selling?

08:54.114 --> 08:56.082
Duh.

08:56.116 --> 08:57.417
I didn't know.

08:57.451 --> 08:59.085
I'm not into non-fiction.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.020
I guess people really read that stuff, huh?

09:01.055 --> 09:02.155
Lots of people.

09:04.491 --> 09:07.527
Hello. Ms. Johnson sent me to get you two.

09:07.561 --> 09:09.696
We have to go. We have a pop quiz.

09:09.730 --> 09:11.030
Oh. Chocolate?

09:11.065 --> 09:13.366
This is really good. It's from France.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.034
France.

09:15.069 --> 09:16.936
Pop quiz? She knows we weren't there.

09:16.971 --> 09:18.204
It's on last night's homework.

09:18.238 --> 09:19.672
Coming to the Mother Daughter Dance?

09:19.707 --> 09:22.041
I don't know, but I might use it

09:22.076 --> 09:24.010
to get my mom to stick
around a little longer.

09:24.044 --> 09:25.378
Oh, is she going to Mimsy's?

09:25.412 --> 09:27.547
That's her grandmother.

09:27.581 --> 09:29.983
If Dad doesn't-- You know.

09:30.017 --> 09:31.517
Go to therapy.

09:31.552 --> 09:34.153
Madison, private information.

09:34.188 --> 09:36.723
That's all right. There's a cone
of silence around the office here.

09:38.092 --> 09:39.559
Couldn't he go to Lauren's dad,

09:39.593 --> 09:41.227
or are they close friends?

09:41.261 --> 09:42.395
That's a great idea.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.230
Yeah, maybe.

09:44.264 --> 09:46.666
I don't want Lauren's dad to
know what's going on in our home.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.168
He already knows.
Lauren tells him everything.

09:49.203 --> 09:51.404
I don't know everything.

09:51.438 --> 09:53.172
And besides, my dad is a professional.

09:53.207 --> 09:55.174
He wouldn't repeat anything
he hears in counseling.

09:55.209 --> 09:56.743
He'll just write a bes
t-selling book about it.

09:56.777 --> 09:58.511
He changes the names.

09:58.545 --> 09:59.912
These are good.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.815
Hi. I have to get this late slip signed.

10:02.850 --> 10:05.251
I tried to get it from the office,
but they don't do that anymore.

10:05.285 --> 10:06.653
I know. Candy?

10:06.687 --> 10:07.854
No, thank you.

10:07.888 --> 10:08.921
Dark chocolate's good for you.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.323
Medical fact. I'm a doctor.

10:10.357 --> 10:12.258
So is red wine, but she can't give us any.

10:12.292 --> 10:14.927
I just really need the late slip.

10:14.962 --> 10:17.430
Is everything okay?
Is everything okay with you?

10:17.464 --> 10:18.898
Or you or you or you

10:18.932 --> 10:20.299
or anyone else, for that matter?

10:25.372 --> 10:27.106
Grace, Grace.

10:27.141 --> 10:28.341
Where are you going?

10:28.375 --> 10:30.777
Leave me alone.
I looked for you before school.

10:30.811 --> 10:32.945
I have to get to class.
I don't want to talk to you.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.747
I wish I'd never talked to you about it.

10:34.782 --> 10:36.916
I didn't say anything to anyone.

10:36.950 --> 10:38.551
Wait, Grace. Leave me alone.

10:43.624 --> 10:46.759
What's going on with Grace?

10:46.794 --> 10:47.794
I don't know.

10:56.316 --> 10:58.283
Grace, I didn't say when
we were getting married.

10:58.318 --> 11:00.218
I said we were thinking about it.

11:00.253 --> 11:02.220
I hope you do that.
I hope you think about it.

11:02.255 --> 11:05.223
And when you do,
I hope you realize it's too soon.

11:05.258 --> 11:06.892
It is soon, I admit it,

11:06.926 --> 11:08.093
but not too soon.

11:08.127 --> 11:09.895
They say that couples
who are happily married

11:09.929 --> 11:12.331
and then lose a partner,
they remarry quickly.

11:12.365 --> 11:14.566
Oh, so now you're some sort of statistic?

11:14.600 --> 11:16.068
I don't know where you got that,

11:16.102 --> 11:18.403
but maybe you should go back and
see if the children are happy

11:18.438 --> 11:19.905
when the parent who's left
behind gets remarried.

11:19.939 --> 11:21.773
Why don't you see how the
children feel about it?

11:21.808 --> 11:25.243
Honey, you are hardly a child.
And Tom isn't a child, either.

11:25.278 --> 11:27.512
No, because we had to grow
up really fast this year

11:27.547 --> 11:28.847
because you're being a child.

11:28.881 --> 11:30.582
You can't just get married

11:30.616 --> 11:32.584
because you're in love and want to have sex.

11:32.618 --> 11:35.654
Grace, we haven't even talked about a date.
We're just talking.

11:35.688 --> 11:38.123
I wish you'd stop talking.
I don't want to talk to you.

11:44.297 --> 11:45.630
I can't really help her.

11:45.665 --> 11:47.265
She hates this guy her mom's marrying,

11:47.300 --> 11:48.934
and she's taking it out on me.

11:48.968 --> 11:51.703
What's wrong with him?
Maybe there is something wrong with him.

11:51.738 --> 11:54.106
You got me out of some bad relationships.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.541
He's younger than her mother,
and he's a doctor.

11:56.576 --> 11:58.777
Mm. Good for Kathleen.

11:58.811 --> 12:02.781
Yeah, he sounds good, but it is a
little too soon, don't you think?

12:02.815 --> 12:05.550
I think I don't have any
judgment about that.

12:05.585 --> 12:07.886
I certainly wouldn't want
anybody saying anything

12:07.920 --> 12:10.522
about your father and me getting married.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.858
Is that why you want a small wedding? No.
I want a small wedding

12:12.892 --> 12:15.894
because I want it to be intimate.

12:15.928 --> 12:19.231
And yes, I think I don't want to know

12:19.265 --> 12:21.233
what Ruben's family and
friends think about it.

12:21.267 --> 12:24.236
And he feels the same way
about my family and friends.

12:24.270 --> 12:27.572
We just don't want anybody
to ruin this moment for us--

12:27.607 --> 12:28.974
Get us off to a bad start.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.977
We've waited a long time for this.

12:32.011 --> 12:35.580
So did you ask Ricky about
meeting his parents?

12:35.615 --> 12:37.916
Because I'm fine with them being witnesses,
if that's what you want.

12:37.950 --> 12:41.920
I asked him, but he seemed
a little weird about it.

12:41.954 --> 12:44.589
I don't think he wants
them to meet you and Ruben.

12:50.129 --> 12:51.897
So you didn't ask me to come by

12:51.931 --> 12:53.732
just to give me a couple of free steaks?

12:53.766 --> 12:55.267
Nope.

12:55.301 --> 12:57.936
I would love to meet Adrian's parents.

12:57.970 --> 13:01.273
I think it's a wonderful idea.
I love meeting new people.

13:01.307 --> 13:03.208
And I would love to go to the wedding.

13:03.242 --> 13:07.546
And I'd love to spend time with Adrian
and her family. And you, of course.

13:07.580 --> 13:08.880
Why's that?

13:08.915 --> 13:11.616
Well, it sounds as if you
and Adrian are really close,

13:11.651 --> 13:15.687
and I'm happy that it's more than
just a physical relationship.

13:15.721 --> 13:17.222
Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.224
I'm just doing this because
she asked me to do this.

13:19.258 --> 13:21.059
I don't really care if you
meet her parents or not.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.894
I don't care if you go
to the wedding or not.

13:22.929 --> 13:24.896
I'd completely understand if you say no.

13:24.931 --> 13:27.566
But we're not saying no. At least, I'm not.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.901
I'll talk to Shaker.
Thank you for the steaks.

13:29.936 --> 13:31.937
Thanks for coming over here to get them.

13:31.971 --> 13:34.139
I came over here to see you.

13:34.173 --> 13:35.941
I have to get back to work.

13:35.975 --> 13:37.342
Of course. Now, just let me know

13:37.376 --> 13:40.612
where and when you want us to show up.

13:40.646 --> 13:42.981
And bring John by.
We haven't see him in weeks.

13:43.015 --> 13:45.684
Sorry. I've been busy. But I will.

13:45.718 --> 13:46.952
I'll see you, okay?

13:46.986 --> 13:48.954
Okay.

13:48.988 --> 13:51.289
Ricky. What?

13:51.324 --> 13:53.959
I know how you get when people get close,

13:53.993 --> 13:55.994
but it's going to be fine, okay?

13:56.028 --> 13:58.263
Yeah. It is.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.297
Bye.

14:02.068 --> 14:03.535
Everything okay?

14:03.569 --> 14:05.203
Yeah. Everything's fine.

14:05.238 --> 14:06.538
Unhappy customer?

14:06.572 --> 14:08.540
What? No, that's my mom.

14:08.574 --> 14:09.541
She's my foster mom.

14:09.575 --> 14:10.542
She's my mom.

14:10.576 --> 14:12.544
Oh. Never met her.

14:12.578 --> 14:14.212
You didn't want to introduce us?

14:14.247 --> 14:15.247
No.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.116
Why not?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.885
I don't like people getting in my business.

14:19.919 --> 14:21.553
When they do start getting in my business,

14:21.587 --> 14:23.221
I have a tendency to cut them off

14:23.256 --> 14:24.890
and never go near them again.

14:24.924 --> 14:27.158
So I'm hoping that as long as we're friends,

14:27.193 --> 14:28.793
you don't do anything stupid

14:28.828 --> 14:30.829
like trying to get to know me or my family.

14:30.863 --> 14:32.564
Okay? You know my family.

14:32.598 --> 14:33.798
You know my dad. You're friends.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.233
No, not friends. He's my boss.

14:35.268 --> 14:36.868
I have a reason to know him.

14:36.903 --> 14:38.236
Okay.

14:38.271 --> 14:39.938
Why does everyone want to
meet my parents, anyway?

14:39.972 --> 14:40.939
Everyone, who?

14:40.973 --> 14:43.074
You. Adrian.

14:43.109 --> 14:45.477
I wanted to meet your mom
because she was here,

14:45.511 --> 14:48.046
and it seemed like the thing to do.
I don't know.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.147
Adrian's never met your parents?

14:49.181 --> 14:50.882
No. Why would she have met them?

14:50.917 --> 14:53.318
I don't know. Why is she meeting them now?

14:53.352 --> 14:54.586
Her stupid parents are getting married,

14:54.620 --> 14:56.254
and they thought it would be nice

14:56.289 --> 14:57.422
if my parents were the witnesses.

14:57.456 --> 15:00.692
That way, it would be their
family and my family.

15:00.726 --> 15:03.228
I don't know how I got myself into this.

15:03.262 --> 15:04.796
Okay, I do. I just don't know

15:04.830 --> 15:06.998
if I want more than sex
out of a relationship.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.034
Is it a relationship if
you're just having sex

15:09.068 --> 15:10.835
and you're not involved in any other way?

15:10.870 --> 15:12.003
Your point?

15:12.038 --> 15:13.872
I don't have a point, I guess.

15:13.906 --> 15:15.473
Good.

15:15.508 --> 15:17.342
How's Grace?

15:17.376 --> 15:19.544
She's okay.

15:19.579 --> 15:20.845
We're just getting to know each other.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.213
How's that going?

15:22.248 --> 15:23.882
Slowly.

15:23.916 --> 15:27.252
We seemed to hit it off,
and then...I don't know.

15:27.286 --> 15:29.220
She's probably got a lot on her mind,

15:29.255 --> 15:30.889
with her mom getting engaged.

15:30.923 --> 15:32.891
I don't know why everyone
wants to get married.

15:32.925 --> 15:34.726
What?

15:34.760 --> 15:35.860
Oh, she didn't tell me.

15:35.895 --> 15:38.096
She didn't tell me, either. Adrian told me.

15:39.765 --> 15:42.167
Don't go getting all weird
because I knew and you didn't.

15:42.201 --> 15:45.904
No, I was just surprised that
she hasn't called to tell me.

15:45.938 --> 15:47.572
Then again, I haven't called her, either,

15:47.607 --> 15:50.241
but I've been busy with my dad and Betty

15:50.276 --> 15:52.177
and helping plan their wedding.

15:52.211 --> 15:53.645
You've been too busy to call Grace,

15:53.679 --> 15:55.580
or is that just an excuse for not calling?

15:55.615 --> 15:56.848
You like her, right?

15:56.882 --> 16:00.251
Yeah, I like her. I really like her.

16:00.286 --> 16:01.486
I mean, who would have thought

16:01.520 --> 16:02.988
that Grace Bowman would go out with me?

16:03.022 --> 16:05.023
But now that she will go out with you,

16:05.057 --> 16:07.225
the challenge is gone,
and so is the interest, right?

16:07.259 --> 16:11.196
You might want to call her,
because it works both ways.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.965
Now that Jack's got somebody,
she might get interested in him.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.401
She's okay with that, with Jack and Madison.

16:27.817 --> 16:30.085
There he is. There's my boy.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.053
Hey, give me night's report.

16:32.088 --> 16:33.421
What am I walking into?

16:33.456 --> 16:34.456
I'm not sure.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.091
Mom's cooking and freezing some meals

16:36.125 --> 16:38.126
so we'll have something
to eat when she leaves.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.761
And Amy's trying to get her

16:39.795 --> 16:41.763
to go to a mother-daughter dance at school

16:41.797 --> 16:44.099
so she'll stick around a little longer

16:44.133 --> 16:45.967
and you'll have a chance
to go to counseling.

16:46.001 --> 16:48.103
I don't really have anything
to talk about to a stranger.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.304
That's not going to happen.

16:49.338 --> 16:51.106
No kidding. What a surprise.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.540
That's sarcasm.

16:52.575 --> 16:55.443
Ashley's the queen of sarcasm.
She got it from me.

16:55.478 --> 16:58.113
Hopefully you'll get it from me, too.
Then you can be on our team.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.715
That's something you could
talk to a stranger about--

17:00.750 --> 17:04.385
Teams. Do families usually
divide into teams?

17:04.420 --> 17:06.387
Sure, but it's usually the
parents against the children--

17:06.422 --> 17:07.521
In the good families.

17:07.556 --> 17:09.190
Where do you get this stuff?

17:09.224 --> 17:11.992
Life. Experience. Life experience.

17:12.027 --> 17:14.729
Okay, well, maybe that's what I need--

17:14.763 --> 17:16.330
More life experience.

17:16.365 --> 17:19.400
But it would seem to me, child that I am,

17:19.435 --> 17:22.237
that if you really wanted your
wife back and our family united,

17:22.271 --> 17:25.073
and all you had to do to get
that was talk to a stranger,

17:25.107 --> 17:26.406
then you'd do it.

17:26.442 --> 17:29.210
What is it, an hour or two
of your time for a few weeks?

17:29.245 --> 17:30.678
Whatever it is, an hour, two hours,

17:30.713 --> 17:32.413
40 hours, it's a waste of time.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.182
No one knows me better than me,

17:34.216 --> 17:36.751
and no one knows your mother
better than her, and then me,

17:36.786 --> 17:39.921
so if we can't work out our issues
on our own, just the two of us,

17:39.955 --> 17:41.122
we can't work out our issues.

17:41.157 --> 17:42.423
Can you work out your issues?

17:42.458 --> 17:44.225
You have some gigantic issues.

17:44.260 --> 17:45.693
We're not going to work them out

17:45.728 --> 17:47.095
in a few weeks or months or even years.

17:47.129 --> 17:49.164
It's going to take a
lifetime to work them out,

17:49.198 --> 17:50.932
and we're not going to a marriage
counselor for a lifetime.

17:50.966 --> 17:54.402
On the way home, Amy told Mom that
you could give Lauren's dad a call.

17:54.436 --> 17:57.772
Yeah? For what? He's a family therapist.

17:57.807 --> 17:59.174
He's one of those strangers

17:59.208 --> 18:01.075
who talks to people who
need someone to talk to.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.710
Yeah. Like Ricky.

18:02.745 --> 18:04.712
I'm not a kid. I'm a grown man.

18:04.747 --> 18:06.915
I don't need to talk to another grown man.

18:06.949 --> 18:08.950
Dad.

18:08.984 --> 18:11.719
I just need to talk to your mother.

18:11.754 --> 18:12.720
And your mother.

18:12.755 --> 18:14.389
And she needs to talk to me.

18:14.423 --> 18:16.057
She'll talk to me, eventually.

18:16.091 --> 18:17.258
It's all going to be fine.

18:26.268 --> 18:29.070
Hey, where's your mom?

18:29.104 --> 18:31.406
She's grabbing a shower
while she has the chance.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.408
Uh-huh. She left you in the kitchen

18:33.442 --> 18:36.077
so you could ask if I'd like to give
your friend Lauren's dad a call.

18:36.111 --> 18:37.412
Yeah.

18:37.446 --> 18:40.415
Okay. 1, I hate that
Ashley tells you everything

18:40.449 --> 18:43.418
before I get the chance
to tell you or before Mom,

18:43.452 --> 18:46.087
and 2, would it kill you to call him?

18:46.121 --> 18:48.122
You know him, kind of.

18:48.157 --> 18:51.392
Come on, Dad. You and Mom are not going
to work everything out on your own.

18:51.427 --> 18:54.429
Ã­!ere'd you get that from? Your mom,
by any chance? It's true.

18:54.463 --> 18:57.799
Ames, it's not something I do,
therapy. I'm against it.

18:57.833 --> 19:02.203
Okay. What if you call Lauren's
dad and have dinner with him?

19:02.238 --> 19:05.039
Having dinner with a therapist
doesn't count, does it?

19:05.074 --> 19:06.541
I don't know, but it's a start.

19:06.575 --> 19:08.042
And Mom doesn't have to
know that it's dinner.

19:08.077 --> 19:10.111
All she has to know is that
you're making an effort,

19:10.145 --> 19:11.713
so make an effort.

19:11.747 --> 19:14.382
If you have a problem, and fixing
it would make your life better,

19:14.416 --> 19:16.885
then fix it. Do whatever
you have to do to fix it.

19:16.919 --> 19:18.620
You talking to me, or you talking to you?

19:20.422 --> 19:23.458
I think someone needs a diaper change

19:23.492 --> 19:26.060
because someone has been
with his sister Ashley

19:26.095 --> 19:28.429
and sister Ashley doesn't
always change diapers.

19:30.766 --> 19:33.268
Call him. His number's on the counter.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.736
You don't want to eat here.

19:34.770 --> 19:36.905
The worst part of the day
is eating in our rooms

19:36.939 --> 19:39.841
as if we all don't remember what it
was like eating in the dining room.

19:44.713 --> 19:47.181
And Amy can't take any more rejection.

19:47.216 --> 19:48.416
First the boyfriend doesn't call,

19:48.450 --> 19:50.084
and now her mom is
threatening to leave again

19:50.119 --> 19:51.419
unless her dad sees a therapist,

19:51.453 --> 19:53.087
and he's not going to see a therapist,

19:53.122 --> 19:55.089
unless you could just have dinner with him.

19:55.124 --> 19:56.557
I'd go, but Amy's not going,

19:56.592 --> 19:58.192
and besides, I want to go out with Jesse.

19:58.227 --> 20:00.762
So this is the emergency?

20:00.796 --> 20:02.430
Having dinner with Amy's dad?

20:02.464 --> 20:05.033
He can't just call and make an appointment?

20:05.067 --> 20:07.302
Oh, answer it.

20:09.471 --> 20:10.471
Hello?

20:10.506 --> 20:12.307
Hi, George. How are you?

20:12.341 --> 20:14.575
You gave him this cell?

20:16.045 --> 20:17.779
No, I'd love to grab a bite.

20:17.813 --> 20:19.714
But Lauren isn't available,

20:19.748 --> 20:21.783
and I know Amy's probably busy.

20:21.817 --> 20:23.251
Amy's got to stick around

20:23.285 --> 20:24.786
because Ricky's coming over to see John.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.121
I just thought the two of us
could duck out on our own.

20:27.156 --> 20:28.623
I need to get out for a bit.

20:28.657 --> 20:31.459
I know the feeling, but if this
is about a family issue, George,

20:31.493 --> 20:34.662
maybe you'd rather just meet
me at the office. Dad, no.

20:34.697 --> 20:35.797
No, it's nothing like that.

20:35.831 --> 20:37.465
I just need to get out of the house,

20:37.499 --> 20:39.801
and Amy said that Lauren said you
need someone to hang out with.

20:39.835 --> 20:40.802
Girls, huh?

20:40.836 --> 20:43.471
All right, I'll meet you.

20:43.505 --> 20:44.706
All right, great.

20:44.740 --> 20:47.008
Say, Jeff's Restaurant, in an hour?

20:47.042 --> 20:48.676
All right. I'll see you there.

20:49.678 --> 20:50.745
Thanks, Dad.

20:50.779 --> 20:52.146
You're welcome.

20:52.181 --> 20:53.815
This probably is not a good idea.

20:53.849 --> 20:55.183
I know how it's going to work out.

20:55.217 --> 20:58.486
You never really know how
things are going to turn out,

20:58.520 --> 21:01.589
and even if you think you do,
just try and stay open.

21:01.623 --> 21:03.691
It's another father reaching out to you.

21:03.726 --> 21:07.695
I know what it is. And by the way,
this isn't an emergency.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.664
Sometimes, your daughter should
come before everything else.

21:09.698 --> 21:13.668
She and my son always come
before everything else.

21:13.702 --> 21:15.069
And we appreciate that,

21:15.104 --> 21:17.739
but right now, I have to
get ready for my date,

21:17.773 --> 21:19.040
so I'll leave you two to argue.

21:20.376 --> 21:22.443
I mean talk.

21:26.448 --> 21:28.750
You look like you got
something on your mind,

21:28.784 --> 21:32.420
and I know you know talking
to George is not an emergency.

21:32.454 --> 21:34.622
What's up? Why'd you really want me here?

21:34.656 --> 21:36.424
We need to switch some weekends around.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.892
Lauren needs me to go with her

21:37.926 --> 21:39.427
to the Mother Daughter Dance next weekend,

21:39.461 --> 21:42.430
and I know that's supposed
to be her weekend with you.

21:42.464 --> 21:43.931
But this is important.

21:43.966 --> 21:46.100
Mother Daughter Dance? What's that?

21:46.135 --> 21:48.102
What happened to the father-daughter dance?

21:48.137 --> 21:49.404
I have no idea.

21:49.438 --> 21:51.806
All right. Shouldn't be a problem.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.241
Good.

21:55.244 --> 21:56.677
Having dinner with Lauren's dad

21:56.712 --> 21:58.112
does not count as therapy.

21:58.147 --> 22:00.548
Who said it did, huh? Not me.

22:00.582 --> 22:02.383
I'm just getting together
with Amy's friend's dad

22:02.418 --> 22:04.218
because neither of us has
anywhere to go tonight.

22:04.253 --> 22:07.388
What's his name again? It's Ken.
Dr. Ken Fields.

22:07.423 --> 22:08.689
Why don't you schedule an appointment

22:08.724 --> 22:10.391
for the two of us to talk to him together

22:10.426 --> 22:12.060
instead of putting him
on the spot at dinner?

22:12.094 --> 22:14.562
I could, but I don't want to.
I just want to have dinner.

22:14.596 --> 22:16.731
If the subject of you and
me comes up, it comes up.

22:16.765 --> 22:19.267
but for all I know, the guy just
needs another guy to talk to.

22:19.301 --> 22:20.902
Don't you get it, George?

22:20.936 --> 22:23.738
Don't you get why I want not
just you, but both of us,

22:23.772 --> 22:25.740
to talk to someone together?

22:25.774 --> 22:27.241
It's too big, George.

22:27.276 --> 22:28.709
It's just too big.

22:28.744 --> 22:30.078
It's almost too big to comprehend

22:30.112 --> 22:32.080
how we got ourselves into this situation.

22:32.114 --> 22:34.749
We need some help sorting it out.

22:34.783 --> 22:36.384
We need to make some decisions.

22:36.418 --> 22:38.419
Like what? Like what?

22:38.454 --> 22:41.289
Like, I don't know, like whether
or not I should stay here.

22:41.323 --> 22:43.424
Amy wants you to go to
that Mother Daughter Dance.

22:43.459 --> 22:44.992
Yeah, I know. She told me.

22:45.027 --> 22:46.094
What about Ashley?

22:46.128 --> 22:47.395
Doesn't matter what Ashley thinks.

22:47.429 --> 22:48.863
Stay. Decided. Next.

22:48.897 --> 22:50.731
Not decided.

22:50.766 --> 22:52.467
What, Ashley doesn't want me to stay?

22:52.501 --> 22:54.635
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
I want you to stay.

22:54.670 --> 22:56.237
If I do stay, we have to decide

22:56.271 --> 22:58.072
whether or not we're going to stay divorced

22:58.107 --> 22:59.507
or if you're going to move out again

22:59.541 --> 23:00.842
or if we're going to get married again.

23:00.876 --> 23:02.176
Get married again. Decided.

23:02.211 --> 23:04.245
Next. What else?
What else do we have to decide?

23:04.279 --> 23:06.347
Whether or not we love each other,

23:06.381 --> 23:09.016
and are committed to each other
and our marriage and our family

23:09.051 --> 23:10.918
enough to stay together
for the rest of our lives.

23:10.953 --> 23:13.821
Can't be decided.
We just see how it goes. Next.

23:13.856 --> 23:15.356
George, listen to me.

23:15.390 --> 23:18.359
Please. I want what I wanted

23:18.393 --> 23:20.361
when I married you in the first place.

23:20.395 --> 23:22.697
I want us to want each other.

23:22.731 --> 23:24.031
I want you to want me,

23:24.066 --> 23:26.033
and I want to want you.

23:26.068 --> 23:28.369
I want us to want to be together,

23:28.403 --> 23:31.706
to miss each other when we're apart.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.374
I want us to raise our children together,

23:33.408 --> 23:35.143
and to grow old together.

23:35.177 --> 23:38.045
I want to forget everything
that's happened before,

23:38.080 --> 23:40.047
and start all over again,

23:40.082 --> 23:44.051
and to make everything
better than it's ever been.

23:44.086 --> 23:47.188
But how are we going to do that,
George? How?

23:47.222 --> 23:49.423
Anne, you have my word

23:49.458 --> 23:50.858
that I'm going to do the best I can do

23:50.893 --> 23:52.426
to give you everything you want.

23:52.461 --> 23:54.128
But this is real life.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.397
I can't promise a happy ending.

23:56.431 --> 23:58.733
All we can do is try.
There are no guarantees,

23:58.767 --> 24:00.535
but I'm willing to take a chance if you are.

24:02.371 --> 24:03.971
Do you really love me, Anne?

24:04.006 --> 24:06.007
Because right now, I get the feeling

24:06.041 --> 24:07.341
you're looking for me to say something,

24:07.376 --> 24:09.510
whether it's in this kitchen or therapy,

24:09.545 --> 24:11.679
that gives you an excuse to leave again.

24:11.713 --> 24:15.349
I'm just looking for you
or for Amy or Ashley

24:15.384 --> 24:17.318
or for someone to say something

24:17.352 --> 24:18.953
to make me want to stay.

24:23.827 --> 24:25.160
Thank you. I owe you so much.

24:25.795 --> 24:28.029
Don't make a big deal out of it. Just don't.

24:28.464 --> 24:30.264
It is a big deal, meeting your parents.

24:30.299 --> 24:31.766
I don't want it to be a big deal.

24:32.801 --> 24:33.768
Okay.

24:33.802 --> 24:35.036
This doesn't mean anything

24:35.070 --> 24:36.871
other than our parents are meeting

24:36.905 --> 24:39.440
so that my parents can be the
witnesses at your parents' wedding.

24:39.475 --> 24:41.108
Yeah, I said okay.

24:41.143 --> 24:43.044
I just want to make sure you know that.

24:43.078 --> 24:46.047
Nothing's going to change just because
everyone gets to know everyone.

24:46.081 --> 24:48.749
I know that. It's not some
kind of commitment on my part.

24:48.784 --> 24:51.586
Doesn't mean we're going
to get married some day.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.054
I know, Ricky, okay?

24:53.088 --> 24:55.122
It's just nice that it's
going to be our families.

24:55.157 --> 24:57.725
It's nice. My family is also with John.

24:57.759 --> 24:58.893
And Amy.

24:58.927 --> 25:01.395
And Amy? And Amy.

25:01.430 --> 25:03.764
Don't you go and ruin this, all right?

25:03.799 --> 25:06.901
I'm just saying, don't forget my
family goes beyond my mom and dad.

25:06.935 --> 25:08.135
All right. Good night.

25:08.170 --> 25:09.237
I'm going over to Amy's.

25:09.271 --> 25:10.571
I'll talk to you in the morning.

25:10.606 --> 25:13.040
It's almost 9:00, and John's asleep by now.

25:13.075 --> 25:15.543
I thought you went ove before you came here.

25:15.577 --> 25:17.378
I didn't. Amy wanted to talk to me,

25:17.412 --> 25:20.281
so she told me to come over
after she got John to bed.

25:20.315 --> 25:21.315
About what?

25:21.350 --> 25:22.450
I don't know.

25:22.484 --> 25:25.052
Her new boyfriend hasn't called her.

25:25.087 --> 25:27.088
Yeah, so?

25:27.122 --> 25:30.024
So I guess she's out there all
by herself, looking again.

25:30.058 --> 25:33.461
Yeah. I imagine at's going to
happen over and over again,

25:33.495 --> 25:36.631
for, like, the next 10 years,
until she finds a guy

25:36.665 --> 25:37.965
who wants to be in a relationship

25:38.000 --> 25:39.934
with a woman who has a
baby with another guy.

25:39.968 --> 25:42.203
Just don't you feel sorry for her, okay?

25:42.237 --> 25:43.971
Please.

25:44.006 --> 25:45.306
Good night.

25:45.340 --> 25:46.474
Night.

26:11.033 --> 26:12.633
What's up?

26:12.668 --> 26:15.636
You have any idea why Amy's new
boyfriend hasn't called her?

26:15.671 --> 26:17.071
Don't know, don't care.

26:17.105 --> 26:19.006
I personally had a date the same night

26:19.041 --> 26:21.842
and never heard from him again either.

26:21.877 --> 26:24.679
<i>It happens. Yeah, but you're strong,
Ashley. You're young.</i>

26:24.713 --> 26:26.514
Yeah, I'm, what, a year younger than Amy

26:26.548 --> 26:28.482
and two years younger than you?

26:28.517 --> 26:31.352
Amy's been through a lot,
and she doesn't need more rejection.

26:31.386 --> 26:33.988
There has to be a reason why
that Jimmy hasn't called her.

26:34.022 --> 26:36.424
Probably. That doesn't mean
we'll ever know that reason.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.292
That means we have to call and ask him.

26:38.327 --> 26:41.128
If Amy's not going to call,
then we have to call.

26:41.163 --> 26:43.297
Geez, are you that insecure?

26:43.332 --> 26:45.633
Do you really think Ricky's
going to dash over here

26:45.667 --> 26:46.968
and throw himself at Amy

26:47.002 --> 26:48.836
because she doesn't have a boyfriend again?

26:48.870 --> 26:50.204
Yes.

26:50.238 --> 26:51.639
Look, I don't have Jimmy's number,

26:51.673 --> 26:54.308
and even if I did,
I wouldn't give it to you,

26:54.343 --> 26:55.443
and I wouldn't call him.

26:55.477 --> 26:58.980
She had to have done something or--

26:59.014 --> 27:01.148
<i>Wait. She said she left her
purse in the car,</i>

27:01.183 --> 27:03.317
and instead of him bringing it back to her,

27:03.352 --> 27:04.785
he sent it in with your friend.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.554
<i>What was in that purse?</i>

27:06.588 --> 27:07.989
Something must have been in that purse

27:08.023 --> 27:09.290
that changed his mind about her.

27:16.698 --> 27:18.733
We just wanted to say good night.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.635
Oh. Good night.

27:20.669 --> 27:22.003
Studying hard, or hardly studying?

27:22.037 --> 27:23.337
Morgan, of course she's studying.

27:23.372 --> 27:25.006
Madison's a very good student.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.008
You should know. You're a smart woman.

27:27.042 --> 27:28.843
You know, Madison,
if you ever need any help--

27:28.877 --> 27:30.011
She doesn't need any help.

27:30.045 --> 27:31.345
I might.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.180
I'm having some trouble with algebra.

27:33.215 --> 27:34.515
Are you good at algebra?

27:34.549 --> 27:36.283
You kidding? She's a business manager.

27:36.318 --> 27:37.718
She manages businesses.

27:37.753 --> 27:40.287
Of course Emily can do algebra.

27:40.322 --> 27:42.289
Oh, yeah. Of course.

27:42.324 --> 27:44.625
So great, great. Go ahead, honey.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.660
Help her.

27:49.464 --> 27:51.298
I don't know that much about algebra.

27:51.333 --> 27:54.669
I haven't found it too practical.

27:54.703 --> 27:57.638
I was just so desperate to
have a conversation with you,

27:57.673 --> 28:01.242
any conversation with you,
Madison, that I lied.

28:01.276 --> 28:03.944
Me, too. I don't have any
trouble with algebra.

28:05.881 --> 28:08.382
Just Jack.

28:08.417 --> 28:12.753
Just? Well, truthfully,
I need some help with guys.

28:12.788 --> 28:16.323
Oh. Well, guys like Jack?

28:16.358 --> 28:18.325
Jack, and guys like Jack.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.995
It just seems that guys only want one thing.

28:21.029 --> 28:25.666
Yeah. Then again, not all guys. Not really.

28:25.701 --> 28:27.668
And those that do want one thing,

28:27.703 --> 28:31.706
they will sometimes
settle for something else.

28:32.974 --> 28:35.943
I'm sorry, I heard you and Lauren

28:35.977 --> 28:38.946
talking about Jack a few
weeks ago. Oh, my God.

28:38.980 --> 28:41.449
You didn't tell my dad,
did you? God, no. Of course not.

28:41.483 --> 28:43.951
Madison, I've been a daughter.

28:43.985 --> 28:45.619
Just never a stepmother.

28:45.654 --> 28:47.455
Well, except for the past three years.

28:47.489 --> 28:50.291
Oh, God, how did we go from
talking about algebra to this?

28:50.325 --> 28:51.959
I don't know, but believe me,

28:51.993 --> 28:54.962
it's a heck of a lot more
interesting than algebra.

28:54.996 --> 28:56.964
Is this what you wanted to talk to me about?

28:56.998 --> 28:58.632
No, not really.

28:58.667 --> 29:02.236
I just wanted to talk to you
about guys and boyfriends.

29:02.270 --> 29:05.306
Here I go lying again.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.774
I do that in awkward situations.

29:06.808 --> 29:09.643
It's just, I've kind of
been leading up to something

29:09.678 --> 29:12.313
that has been bothering me
for the last four years,

29:12.347 --> 29:14.982
and it's just that I thought
that maybe you'd been

29:15.016 --> 29:17.151
dating my dad before my mom died,

29:17.185 --> 29:20.154
and I just figured I would
try to find a way to ask you,

29:20.188 --> 29:23.924
because I didn't think I could
go any longer without asking you.

29:23.959 --> 29:27.995
I'm happy you only let four
years go by before you did,

29:28.029 --> 29:29.997
because the answer is no.

29:30.031 --> 29:31.999
I met him after, after your mother died.

29:32.033 --> 29:33.534
That's such a relief.

29:33.568 --> 29:35.536
That's why you've hated me
for the last four years?

29:35.570 --> 29:37.371
Oh, no, there's lots of reasons.

29:37.405 --> 29:39.006
Okay.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.509
Uh, well, you don't have to
tell me if you don't want.

29:41.543 --> 29:43.511
Oh, no, I want. No, if it's a way to avoid

29:43.545 --> 29:45.513
talking about what I overheard
you and Lauren talking about--

29:45.547 --> 29:47.214
No, I want to tell you.

29:47.249 --> 29:49.650
All right.

29:59.394 --> 30:02.696
Okay. I tried telling her,
but she's not picking up.

30:02.731 --> 30:04.298
Well, then you tell her when you see her.

30:04.332 --> 30:06.033
I don't think I have to tell her, Dad.

30:06.067 --> 30:07.835
That's not how people my age do things.

30:07.869 --> 30:11.038
How do you do things? What do you
think is the right thing to do here?

30:11.072 --> 30:13.040
Don't call her, don't text her,

30:13.074 --> 30:14.341
and she'll get the message

30:14.376 --> 30:16.177
without me having to say it
to her and hurt her feelings.

30:16.211 --> 30:17.912
But her feelings are
going to be hurt anyway.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.246
Yeah, exactly.

30:20.415 --> 30:22.516
What are we doing now?

30:22.551 --> 30:24.485
Now we're just going over
to Grace's house to talk.

30:24.519 --> 30:25.886
Just talk? Really?

30:25.921 --> 30:27.054
You and Grace?

30:29.591 --> 30:32.426
I vote Madison. I like Madison.
Don't go back with Grace.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.995
Mom. What? Madison is fun.

30:35.030 --> 30:37.164
Grace is so serious.

30:37.199 --> 30:38.799
And why should you break up with Madison

30:38.834 --> 30:40.134
and go running back torace

30:40.168 --> 30:41.702
just because she needs you?

30:41.736 --> 30:44.471
Because of that. She needs me,
and Madison doesn't need me.

30:44.506 --> 30:48.609
Don't go with needy. Go with fun. You're 17.

30:48.643 --> 30:50.778
I don't know why I asked
either of you about this.

30:50.812 --> 30:53.180
Because we're your parents,
and you want to do the right thing.

30:54.683 --> 30:58.319
Darling, he's choosing between
oral sex from a fun redhead

30:58.353 --> 31:00.654
or the chance to go all the way
again with a mixed-up blonde.

31:00.689 --> 31:03.157
He's not concerned about the right thing.

31:03.191 --> 31:05.025
We should talk about this some more.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.995
No, we've talked too much already.

31:08.029 --> 31:11.332
It's never a good idea when parents
get involved in relationships.

31:11.366 --> 31:13.434
I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked.

31:13.468 --> 31:14.568
But you did.

31:14.603 --> 31:16.604
I shouldn't have. You did.

31:21.042 --> 31:23.344
Hey, just letting you
know we're going to bed.

31:23.378 --> 31:24.378
Good night.

31:26.781 --> 31:28.349
Thought you were going to bed.

31:28.383 --> 31:31.018
I am, I am. Just thought I'd
spend a few minutes talking

31:31.052 --> 31:33.721
before I go off to my lovely bride-to-be.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.291
It's great being in love.

31:37.325 --> 31:38.859
I can't wait to get married.

31:38.894 --> 31:40.961
Yeah, it'll be nice to make it official.

31:40.996 --> 31:42.930
And you're okay with the big wedding?

31:42.964 --> 31:44.632
Of course. Whatever Betty wants.

31:44.666 --> 31:46.800
And we never had a party at the house,

31:46.835 --> 31:49.303
so we could put that garden to good use.

31:49.337 --> 31:51.338
So yeah, I can't wait.

31:52.674 --> 31:54.708
Who you going to be bringing
to the wedding? Grace?

31:54.743 --> 31:55.876
I don't know, actually.

31:55.911 --> 31:57.378
I heard that she's got some stuff

31:57.412 --> 31:58.579
going on with her family,

31:58.613 --> 32:00.014
so now may not be the best time

32:00.048 --> 32:01.148
to bring her to a wedding.

32:01.182 --> 32:02.549
I think Betty has her

32:02.584 --> 32:04.251
and her brother and her mom on the list.

32:04.286 --> 32:05.619
Really? Yeah.

32:05.654 --> 32:06.987
She and Tom met before.

32:07.022 --> 32:09.323
They didn't do anything, they just met.

32:09.357 --> 32:11.325
So they stay in contact.

32:11.359 --> 32:12.393
I see.

32:12.427 --> 32:13.994
Well, then I guess he'll want to go,

32:14.029 --> 32:16.330
and maybe Grace and her mom, too,

32:16.364 --> 32:19.333
but I think Grace's mom just got engaged,

32:19.367 --> 32:21.001
or she's thinking about getting engaged,

32:21.036 --> 32:23.671
and I don't think Grace
is too happy about it.

32:23.705 --> 32:24.972
At least, that's what I heard.

32:25.006 --> 32:26.407
And she didn't tell you?

32:27.809 --> 32:30.210
She told Ricky.

32:30.245 --> 32:32.313
When are you going to
stop competing with Ricky?

32:32.347 --> 32:33.948
You two are friends.

32:33.982 --> 32:38.285
No, it's just that I'm so confused.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.287
I like Grace. I do.

32:40.322 --> 32:42.957
She's easy to talk to,
and we have so much in common,

32:42.991 --> 32:47.227
and she's beautiful, but...

32:47.262 --> 32:49.196
Can't stop thinking about Amy?

32:51.366 --> 32:54.802
Give it some time.
Don't rush back into anything.

32:54.836 --> 32:56.003
See how it goes.

33:00.108 --> 33:03.310
Amy's mom and dad were already
thinking about getting a divorce,

33:03.345 --> 33:05.312
and then she found out
that he cheated on her,

33:05.347 --> 33:07.648
so she made him think that
she was cheating on him,

33:07.682 --> 33:10.317
and then she got pregnant, so he thought
it was the new boyfriend's baby,

33:10.352 --> 33:13.320
and they got divorced, but then
he found out that it was his baby,

33:13.355 --> 33:15.155
and he wanted to get back together,

33:15.190 --> 33:17.157
but we don't know how they're
going to get back together,

33:17.192 --> 33:19.159
so Amy and Lauren got Lauren's dad

33:19.194 --> 33:21.829
to go to dinner with him. With George?

33:21.863 --> 33:23.097
Well, yeah, because he'd never go

33:23.131 --> 33:25.332
to an actual therapy session.

33:25.367 --> 33:28.335
And Lauren's dad is who
Ricky sees, and Adrian.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.671
I think they go together,
but Ricky's the one who needs it.

33:30.705 --> 33:33.007
I mean, come on, because he's Ricky.

33:33.041 --> 33:35.943
Do you want to go to
that dance next weekend?

33:35.977 --> 33:40.280
Oh, of course. Not that I can dance.

33:40.315 --> 33:43.951
It's okay. I already told everybody
that you're a horrible dancer.

33:43.985 --> 33:46.620
You know who's a really great dancer,
though, is Jack.

33:46.654 --> 33:49.289
I thought you weren't
going to see Jack anymore.

33:49.324 --> 33:51.959
Yeah. I'm not going to do that anymore--

33:51.993 --> 33:54.294
Not unless he really gets
away from Grace this time.

33:54.329 --> 33:56.296
There's no guarantee of that.

33:56.331 --> 33:58.799
Sorry, go on.

33:58.833 --> 34:00.634
Well, there's no guarantee of anything.

34:00.668 --> 34:02.302
I could get hit by a bus tomorrow,

34:02.337 --> 34:04.638
or I could choke to death in
the cafeteria on a fruit cup.

34:04.672 --> 34:07.307
I think about these things.
I've always been kind of an existentialist.

34:07.342 --> 34:08.976
Like, even when I was a kid, I was thinking,

34:09.010 --> 34:10.978
"Wow, this is fun, but why is it a sandbox?"

34:11.012 --> 34:12.312
It's like gender roles in America.

34:12.347 --> 34:14.648
After that, it was never the same,

34:14.681 --> 34:15.983
and it's never going to be the same

34:16.016 --> 34:18.318
because now she's got
that idiot in our lives.

34:18.353 --> 34:20.987
I'm still angry that my wife-- Ex-wife.

34:21.022 --> 34:24.658
Would ever be attracted to
a guy like that. Surgeon.

34:24.692 --> 34:27.327
I know it's necessary for a
surgeon to have a strong ego,

34:27.362 --> 34:29.329
but this guy thinks he's God.

34:29.364 --> 34:31.498
And there he is with my children

34:31.533 --> 34:33.667
in my house with my wife.

34:33.701 --> 34:34.967
Ex-wife.

34:35.003 --> 34:36.603
I can't believe that that's the guy.

34:36.638 --> 34:38.605
Out of all the guys in
the world to choose from,

34:38.639 --> 34:40.940
that that's who she'd choose.

34:40.975 --> 34:43.342
I mean, you can't choose
your wife's husband.

34:43.378 --> 34:45.112
Ex-wife.

34:45.146 --> 34:50.617
But this guy? And now he has Jason
convinced he should be a doctor.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.953
I'm a doctor. A medical doctor.

34:52.987 --> 34:54.955
That's not a Ph.D. after my name.

34:54.989 --> 34:59.159
I'm a psychiatrist,
which my wife seems to forget.

34:59.194 --> 35:00.627
Ex-wife.

35:00.662 --> 35:05.299
Ex-nothing. Once a wife,
always a wife, married or not.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.234
You can't just forget you slept with a woman

35:07.268 --> 35:08.635
for 20 years and had two children.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.771
No, no, she is still my wife.

35:14.676 --> 35:17.644
Geez.

35:17.679 --> 35:20.647
I really am angry. Still angry.

35:20.682 --> 35:25.652
I still can't let it go.

35:25.687 --> 35:27.955
But even married,
she can't let it go, either.

35:27.989 --> 35:29.123
Your wife?

35:29.157 --> 35:30.124
Ex-wife.

35:30.158 --> 35:31.925
There you go.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.928
You got a long road ahead of you, my friend.

35:34.963 --> 35:37.931
When you have children together,
you're together.

35:37.966 --> 35:40.667
Like it or not, for life.

35:44.205 --> 35:47.608
I don't know. This is awkward.

35:47.642 --> 35:49.209
I don't think it's going to help.

35:49.244 --> 35:52.513
You're just too self-conscious. Relax.

35:52.547 --> 35:54.581
I can't kiss you.

35:54.616 --> 35:56.283
You kissed me before we had a baby.

35:56.317 --> 35:58.619
I think you can kiss me again.

35:58.653 --> 36:00.154
Just close your eyes.

36:01.589 --> 36:03.790
I'll do all the hard stuff.

36:03.825 --> 36:05.959
Believe me, it's nothing to either of us.

36:05.994 --> 36:07.728
We're just friends.

36:07.762 --> 36:09.730
Friends with a baby.

36:09.764 --> 36:11.532
Just close your eyes.

36:19.340 --> 36:20.707
Well?

36:37.951 --> 36:38.918
Who is it?

36:38.952 --> 36:41.921
It's me, Mrs. Bowman. Ben Boykevich.

36:41.955 --> 36:43.489
Oh.

36:43.524 --> 36:45.892
Hi, Ben. It's kind of late.

36:45.926 --> 36:48.261
I know, but I just thought I'd stop by.

36:48.295 --> 36:49.829
I texted Grace.

36:49.863 --> 36:51.697
Oh. I didn't realize. Come on in.

36:53.634 --> 36:56.135
I apologize. I should have waited

36:56.170 --> 36:57.303
until Grace texted me back.

36:57.337 --> 37:00.406
But, um, is that Jack's car out front?

37:00.441 --> 37:03.776
I don't think so. Let me just go get Grace.

37:03.811 --> 37:05.611
Hi, Mrs. Bowman.

37:05.646 --> 37:06.679
Jack.

37:06.713 --> 37:07.947
You were upstairs?

37:07.981 --> 37:09.582
Yeah, Grace let me in the back.

37:09.616 --> 37:12.718
And then the two of you quietly
snuck up to her bedroom?

37:12.753 --> 37:14.220
We were just talking.

37:14.254 --> 37:15.755
About me?

37:15.789 --> 37:17.256
I think I'll be going.

37:17.291 --> 37:19.525
Suit yourself, Ben.
I'm going to talk to Grace.

37:25.332 --> 37:26.799
You saw my car out front?

37:26.834 --> 37:30.503
Yeah. I tried to text Grace a few times.

37:30.537 --> 37:31.504
Can't you take a hint?

37:31.538 --> 37:33.573
Yes, I can normally,

37:33.607 --> 37:35.741
but I like talking to Grace,

37:35.776 --> 37:37.477
and I really wanted someone to talk to.

37:37.511 --> 37:38.744
Why didn't you call Adrian?

37:38.779 --> 37:40.580
I like to talk to Adrian, too,

37:40.614 --> 37:42.748
but I thought that Adrian
might be with Ricky,

37:42.783 --> 37:45.251
and Ricky doesn't particularly
like me calling Adrian,

37:45.285 --> 37:47.320
so I'm trying to quit.

37:47.354 --> 37:49.589
I guess I should stop calling Grace, too.

37:49.623 --> 37:53.259
I will stop calling or texting Grace, too.

37:53.293 --> 37:54.827
We're not getting back together.

37:54.862 --> 37:57.096
She called me because she
wanted someone to talk to,

37:57.130 --> 37:58.664
and she didn't want to call you

37:58.699 --> 38:00.066
because she doesn't want you to know

38:00.100 --> 38:01.300
how screwed up her family is

38:01.335 --> 38:04.570
because she likes you.

38:04.605 --> 38:06.772
She thinks of me as just a friend now,

38:06.807 --> 38:10.276
and she likes you as more than a friend.

38:10.310 --> 38:12.011
Just in case you're still interested.

38:12.045 --> 38:13.513
Really? Yeah.

38:13.547 --> 38:18.284
And when she called, I thought
it was something else, but...

38:18.318 --> 38:20.620
Grace and her mother may
be up there for a while.

38:20.654 --> 38:22.522
They're kind of in a bad place right now.

38:22.556 --> 38:25.291
This was a stupid idea.

38:25.325 --> 38:27.260
When I couldn't get Grace, I--

38:27.294 --> 38:30.296
Texted me, and when you didn't get me,

38:30.330 --> 38:33.666
you thought I'd be over here,
so you came over. Been there.

38:34.902 --> 38:36.235
And you did call Adrian,

38:36.270 --> 38:39.238
and she told you that
Ricky was over at Amy's.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.907
She called Grace.

38:40.941 --> 38:42.508
They really are friends.

38:42.543 --> 38:44.477
They fight, but they're friends.

38:44.511 --> 38:47.580
Yeah, I did talk to Adrian.

38:47.614 --> 38:48.915
And then I talked to Ashley,

38:48.949 --> 38:51.918
because Adrian wanted me to talk to Ashley.

38:51.952 --> 38:53.953
I really wish I hadn't talked to Ashley.

38:55.689 --> 38:57.623
How'd everything get so screwed up?

38:57.658 --> 39:00.192
I don't know. Sex?

39:06.833 --> 39:09.602
You don't want Ben to know
how screwed up our family is?

39:09.636 --> 39:12.438
Honey, his dad is marrying Betty,

39:12.472 --> 39:13.606
Tom's internet hooker.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.275
Yeah, but his mom's been dead for years.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.044
Like, over five years.

39:18.078 --> 39:22.949
Sweetie, everyone's family is screwed
up in some way or another, okay?

39:22.983 --> 39:26.786
We're not the only ones.
Look at Adrian and her family.

39:26.820 --> 39:29.622
This is her dad's fourth marriage.

39:29.656 --> 39:31.958
And look at Amy and her family.

39:31.992 --> 39:33.793
Honey, look at anyone's family.

39:33.827 --> 39:37.630
No one is perfect. No one.

39:37.664 --> 39:40.066
Not you and certainly not me.

39:40.100 --> 39:43.970
Yeah, but if anyone was close to perfect...

39:44.004 --> 39:48.307
Yeah. If anyone was close to perfect,

39:48.342 --> 39:50.743
it was your dad.

39:52.446 --> 39:54.447
It was Marshall.

39:56.683 --> 39:59.986
So there's this dance next week,

40:00.020 --> 40:02.655
this Mother Daughter Dance.

40:02.689 --> 40:04.090
If you want to go with me...

40:04.124 --> 40:06.792
Of course. Honey, I would love to go.

40:06.827 --> 40:09.795
I mean, it's not the day you're
getting married or anything.

40:09.830 --> 40:11.163
If it's the day I'm getting married,

40:11.198 --> 40:13.232
I would change the date to go with you.

40:13.266 --> 40:14.667
No, you won't. I wouldn't let you.

40:14.701 --> 40:16.836
I love you, sweetie.

40:16.870 --> 40:18.337
I love you, too.

40:19.539 --> 40:21.340
Guess what.

40:21.375 --> 40:25.211
I love Tammy, and I asked her to marry me.

40:25.245 --> 40:27.546
And she said?

40:27.581 --> 40:29.482
Just kidding.

40:30.484 --> 40:33.919
I am not getting married to Tammy.

40:33.954 --> 40:37.923
I'm going to wait for Adrian.

40:43.296 --> 40:46.766
Oh, there you are.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.568
I was just with Robbie,
and I thought you might be in there.

40:49.603 --> 40:51.070
No, I'm right here.

40:51.104 --> 40:52.505
Yeah.

40:52.539 --> 40:54.073
So you wanted to talk to me?

40:54.107 --> 40:55.841
Kind of.

40:55.876 --> 40:57.009
Really?

40:57.044 --> 40:59.278
You know, he's a great guy-- Dad.

41:00.514 --> 41:03.282
And he's made some mistakes.

41:03.316 --> 41:05.851
A lot of mistakes.

41:05.886 --> 41:07.953
Okay, let's face it, he's full of mistakes.

41:07.988 --> 41:09.622
But he loves you.

41:10.857 --> 41:12.625
He loves all of us,

41:12.659 --> 41:14.460
and he's not going to go to therapy.

41:14.494 --> 41:17.263
And I think this dinner's the
best you're going to get,

41:17.297 --> 41:20.866
so I was just thinking...

41:22.302 --> 41:24.270
could you just see how things go

41:24.304 --> 41:26.272
for the next few weeks?

41:26.306 --> 41:28.808
You know, just stick around a little longer.

41:28.842 --> 41:30.810
Because?

41:30.844 --> 41:34.413
Because-- Look, I know it
seems as if I love Dad best,

41:34.448 --> 41:37.083
just like it seems as if you love Amy best,

41:37.117 --> 41:40.219
but you and I both know that
Dad and Amy need the most help,

41:40.253 --> 41:42.555
so you help her and I help him,

41:42.589 --> 41:44.523
and that's just the way it's worked out.

41:44.558 --> 41:45.658
That's how you see it?

41:45.692 --> 41:48.227
That's how I see it.

41:48.261 --> 41:51.230
Which doesn't mean that we
don't all need each other.

41:51.264 --> 41:53.065
We're all kind of dazed and confused,

41:53.100 --> 41:55.134
and maybe with some time,

41:55.168 --> 41:58.370
things will just work
themselves out. Or not.

41:58.405 --> 42:01.574
I mean, you know how it is with babies.

42:01.608 --> 42:02.875
They either push you together,

42:02.909 --> 42:04.443
like tonight with Amy and Ricky,

42:04.478 --> 42:06.412
or they pull you apart,

42:06.446 --> 42:09.582
like tonight with you and Dad.

42:09.616 --> 42:11.450
Life is kind of a push and pull, isn't it?

42:11.485 --> 42:13.119
I guess you could say that.

42:13.153 --> 42:17.089
So could you stay a little longer, Mom?

42:17.124 --> 42:19.658
I'm thinking about it, Ashley. I don't know.

42:19.693 --> 42:23.062
What was it you said tonight
about Amy and Ricky?

42:23.096 --> 42:24.997
I didn't say-- It was nothing.

42:25.031 --> 42:26.999
Look, Amy really, really needs you

42:27.033 --> 42:29.902
to go to this Mother
Daughter Dance with her.

42:29.936 --> 42:31.937
She's got some serious issues.

42:31.972 --> 42:34.507
You're my daughter too, Ashley.

42:34.541 --> 42:35.941
Do you need me to go?

42:35.976 --> 42:39.512
Mom, I don't know if I need
you to go to a dance, ever,

42:39.546 --> 42:45.518
but I would love it if you would go,

42:45.552 --> 42:50.890
because I love you, Mom.

42:55.228 --> 42:57.496
I love you, too, Ashley.
