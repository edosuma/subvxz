00:00.856 --> 00:02.140
<i>Nine years ago,</i>

00:02.306 --> 00:04.723
I witnessed my mother's murder.

00:04.725 --> 00:07.926
I would have been killed, too,
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:07.928 --> 00:09.794
<i>I was part of an experimental</i>

00:09.796 --> 00:11.513
<i>special forces group.</i>

00:11.633 --> 00:14.718
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:14.720 --> 00:17.037
<i>They made us stronger,</i>
<i>faster, better.</i>

00:17.039 --> 00:18.938
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:18.940 --> 00:21.024
<i>They gave orders</i>
<i>to kill us all.</i>

00:21.026 --> 00:23.727
<i>Somehow, I survived and have</i>
<i>been in hiding ever since.</i>

00:23.729 --> 00:25.645
<i>Until a case</i>
<i>brought me back to him.</i>

00:25.647 --> 00:28.898
<i>But also alerted the group</i>
<i>that experimented on him.</i>

00:28.900 --> 00:31.818
<i>Now we're both in danger.</i>

00:31.820 --> 00:33.420
And our best chance at survival

00:33.422 --> 00:36.089
<i>is if we save each other.</i>

That's why you came home
so late, isn't it?

01:27.843 --> 01:29.175
You were with her.

01:31.045 --> 01:33.096
For a little bit, yeah.

01:33.098 --> 01:36.433
I know what you're

01:46.861 --> 01:49.062
Seriously,
where are you going?

01:49.064 --> 01:51.364
For a walk.

01:51.366 --> 01:53.566
Stick to rooftops
where it's safe.

01:53.568 --> 01:55.618
I'll be back soon.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.487
If you're going out,
I'm coming with.

01:57.489 --> 01:59.572
No, no,
that is a bad idea.

01:59.574 --> 02:01.207
That makes us even.

02:03.928 --> 02:06.863
So that's why you want to ask
that Sara girl out, right?

02:06.865 --> 02:08.798
Delicate stomach?

02:08.800 --> 02:11.167

who happens to be

02:11.169 --> 02:13.253
the Associate Chair of
the Earth Sciences Department.

02:13.255 --> 02:15.588
And I'm not asking her out
because I live in

02:15.590 --> 02:16.706
an abandoned warehouse

02:16.708 --> 02:18.541
with a complicated
roommate.

02:18.543 --> 02:20.877
You're afraid
she's gonna say no.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.230
Maybe I'm misinterpreting

02:24.232 --> 02:27.183
our eye contact
at department meetings.

02:27.185 --> 02:29.102
I mean, I think
she's staring at me, but...

02:29.104 --> 02:31.938
Please, please don't shoot me.

02:31.940 --> 02:33.857

Because you were not in bed
when I came home.

04:13.008 --> 04:16.325
Uh, yeah, I was on a case.

04:16.327 --> 04:19.829
So why'd you leave
your badge here?

04:21.632 --> 04:25.885

No, but being your curious

like having a party this year.

04:47.042 --> 04:48.357
I do not get it.

04:48.359 --> 04:50.860
I mean, what is so different
about this year?

04:50.862 --> 04:53.212

05:53.224 --> 05:54.474
Excuse me, Detectives?

05:54.476 --> 05:56.142
The front desk
directed me to you.

05:56.144 --> 05:57.860
I'm Michael Walters.

05:57.862 --> 05:59.145
How can we help, Michael?

05:59.147 --> 06:00.763
Have a seat.

06:02.533 --> 06:07.269
My fiancée, Amy, she was
at the apartment and, uh...

06:07.271 --> 06:08.938
she's missing.

06:08.940 --> 06:11.290
Uh, um...

06:11.292 --> 06:13.743
This is her.

06:13.745 --> 06:14.911
Here.

06:14.913 --> 06:17.497
How long has she
been gone for?

06:17.499 --> 06:19.415
About three hours, I think.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.283
I came home from
an all night ER rotation,

06:21.285 --> 06:22.502
and I made her breakfast.

06:22.504 --> 06:24.453
Then I went
to Café Vermeer to get

06:24.455 --> 06:26.472
our favorite coffee,
and when I came back,

06:26.474 --> 06:28.290
maybe 20 minutes later,
she was gone.

06:28.292 --> 06:30.176
When you got
home, were there

06:30.178 --> 06:31.644
any suspicious circumstances?

06:31.646 --> 06:32.795
Door kicked in?

06:32.797 --> 06:34.296
No.

06:34.298 --> 06:36.816
I just found her engagement ring
left on the table.

06:38.435 --> 06:41.303
Was there anything else
out of the ordinary?

06:41.305 --> 06:42.655
Maybe some stuff missing?

06:42.657 --> 06:44.407
I don't know.

06:44.409 --> 06:45.975
The bedroom closet
was open, but...

06:45.977 --> 06:47.744
I hate to break it to you,

06:47.746 --> 06:49.812
but I think
she left you.

06:49.814 --> 06:51.497
You don't know her.

06:51.499 --> 06:54.083
Look, we're about
to get married.

06:54.085 --> 06:55.535
She would never leave me.

06:55.537 --> 06:56.953
It's not possible.

06:56.955 --> 06:59.122
Michael, we have
to wait 48 hours

06:59.124 --> 07:01.040
to open an official
investigation.

07:06.965 --> 07:08.464
Oh, I see.

07:08.466 --> 07:12.135
Look, um, maybe we can
swing by the apartment,

07:12.137 --> 07:14.336
see if there's anything
that catches our attention.

07:14.338 --> 07:15.638
We can?

07:15.640 --> 07:17.390
Thank you so much.
I really...

07:17.392 --> 07:20.359
Thank you,
Detectives.

07:20.361 --> 07:22.845
Heartbreaking.

07:22.847 --> 07:25.014
Pathetic.

07:38.599 --> 07:40.383
That's you, isn't it?
That's your jacket.

07:40.385 --> 07:42.218
No one could recognize me
from that jacket.

07:42.220 --> 07:43.937
Who knows what else is on
that surveillance tape?

07:44.339 --> 07:45.954
What were you
thinking?

07:45.956 --> 07:47.923
What was I supposed to do,
let the guy shoot the clerk?

07:47.925 --> 07:49.308
You guys have to be
more careful.

07:49.310 --> 07:50.976
Me, choir.

07:50.978 --> 07:54.146
But seems that since he met you,
Vincent feels alive.

07:54.148 --> 07:56.816
He thinks he can
have a normal life

07:56.818 --> 07:57.950
and walk on
sidewalks and stuff.

07:57.952 --> 07:59.101
You know
who can't do that?

07:59.103 --> 08:01.320
Guys with death certificates.

08:02.989 --> 08:04.807
You know what we should do.

08:04.809 --> 08:06.141
Not we, me. It's the benefit

08:06.143 --> 08:07.727
of having someone
on the inside.

08:07.729 --> 08:09.111
I'll call the
local precinct

08:09.113 --> 08:10.479
and make sure
there's nothing else

08:10.481 --> 08:11.480
on that surveillance tape.

08:11.482 --> 08:12.915
That would be great,

08:12.917 --> 08:14.533
but I think
he's talking about Phase B.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.152
You seriously have
something called "Phase B"?

08:17.154 --> 08:18.371
What if she's right?

08:18.373 --> 08:19.955
What if someone
catches on to that photo?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.540
We've never taken
the precautions

08:21.542 --> 08:22.991
we should around here.

08:22.993 --> 08:24.827
And if you're gonna
go for walks,

08:24.829 --> 08:26.095
we need better security,

08:26.097 --> 08:27.713
in case someone
follows you home.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.165
Great. As if my life
isn't walled up enough already.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.467
I'll start the inventory of what
we need to steal from campus.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.270
I didn't hear that.

08:34.272 --> 08:35.604
I didn't say it.

08:37.140 --> 08:40.726
Is it too late
for "happy birthday"?

08:42.562 --> 08:44.397
How did you know?

08:44.399 --> 08:47.182
I've been watching
over you, remember?

08:47.184 --> 08:49.685
Your birthday
was just always

08:49.687 --> 08:53.205
a good marker each year to
check in, make sure you're okay.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.491
Here.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.025
Thank you.

08:57.027 --> 08:58.461
Having a party?

08:58.463 --> 09:01.080
You always have a party.

09:02.466 --> 09:05.584
Uh, yeah-- no,
not this year.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.471
I don't feel like it.

09:08.473 --> 09:12.057
As I got older, I thought that
I understood more about life.

09:12.059 --> 09:14.760
And now, it's like
I've crossed this line,

09:14.762 --> 09:17.763
and the world doesn't
make sense to me anymore.

09:21.852 --> 09:26.689
You know, my birthday
used to be so simple.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.692
My mom-- she'd make me
pancakes for dinner.

09:31.245 --> 09:32.778
And she'd buy me

09:32.780 --> 09:34.396
a new pair of flannel pajamas,

09:34.398 --> 09:38.334
and... we'd just
watch old movies.

09:38.336 --> 09:41.086
Like I say, I'm
not in the mood

09:41.088 --> 09:43.622
to play truth or dare
with my friends,

09:43.624 --> 09:47.593
when I spend most of my days
lying to them.

09:47.595 --> 09:51.831
About where I've been,
who I've been with.

09:56.136 --> 09:57.603
I should, uh...

09:57.605 --> 09:59.472
I should probably go.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.806
My-my partner's
waiting for me.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.691
I told her I left
something at home.

10:02.693 --> 10:05.427
Another lie.

10:05.429 --> 10:07.613
Thank you.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.604
Thanks for coming by.

10:15.606 --> 10:18.123
Have you heard from
Amy's family or friends at all?

10:18.125 --> 10:22.110
Oh, well, her parents died
in a car accident years ago.

10:22.112 --> 10:25.798
She doesn't have any siblings
or close friends, really.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.416
She was kind of shy
and quiet.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.168
She left her
engagement ring on the table.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.836
That seems kind of loud.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.389
I wanted to surprise her with
breakfast and the announcement.

10:33.391 --> 10:35.674
I sent it into the paper.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.511
I thought
she'd find it romantic.

10:40.430 --> 10:43.649
We planned a quiet wedding
in Rockland County,

10:43.651 --> 10:46.185
just us and the justice.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.987
How long did Amy live here?

10:47.989 --> 10:50.689
Um...

10:50.691 --> 10:55.160
she moved in with me
about a year ago.

10:55.162 --> 10:57.112
No photos of you two?

10:57.114 --> 10:58.364
She's a Virgo.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.466
Liked to keep our place
super clean.

11:00.468 --> 11:02.618
You have anything
with her name on it?

11:02.620 --> 11:03.752
Uh...

11:03.754 --> 11:05.421
I'll take a look.

11:07.257 --> 11:09.174
Do you think it's strange
that there's absolutely no sign

11:09.176 --> 11:11.210
of a woman living here?

11:12.963 --> 11:15.297
How could she pack up a year's
worth of life in 20 minutes?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.332
Yeah, it took me
five weeks to pack up

11:17.334 --> 11:19.885
my studio apartment
last time I moved.

11:29.846 --> 11:33.065
This place makes it seem
like she never existed at all.

11:34.534 --> 11:36.518
I'll check the bedroom.

11:51.167 --> 11:52.918
Uh... sorry,
I couldn't

11:52.920 --> 11:54.336
find anything
with her name on it.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.839
I usually keep my bleach
by the laundry.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.224
Oh, well, she must've
been cleaning in here.

11:59.226 --> 12:00.726
She does that a lot,

12:00.728 --> 12:02.728
- but it didn't bother me.
- Hey, Cat.

12:02.730 --> 12:04.013
Phone for you.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.181
Just give me a second,
okay, Michael?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.366
Mm-hmm.

12:08.217 --> 12:09.935
Closet.

12:34.427 --> 12:35.844
Mind if I use
your bathroom?

12:35.846 --> 12:37.930
It's a long drive back
to the precinct.

12:37.932 --> 12:40.182
Of course.

12:40.184 --> 12:42.417
Thanks.

13:15.785 --> 13:18.303
<i>What are we looking at?</i>
<i>Murder? Missing persons?</i>

13:18.305 --> 13:19.638
We found a woman's hair.
We're checking to see

13:19.640 --> 13:21.289
if its DNA gets a hit
on that Amy woman,

13:21.291 --> 13:23.008
if the DNA matches the blood
found in the closet.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.226
Why would he report her

13:24.228 --> 13:25.460
if he's the one
that killed her?

13:25.462 --> 13:26.679
Throw off suspicion with tears.

13:26.681 --> 13:27.846
You know, she sees
the announcement,

13:27.848 --> 13:29.348
realizes she's
making a mistake,

13:29.350 --> 13:31.650
and then gives the ring back.
He flips out,

13:31.652 --> 13:33.736
kills her, cleans it
up and then realizes

13:33.738 --> 13:35.521
someone's gonna
report her missing.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.106
He could be a flight risk.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.191
Okay, I'll put
undercovers on him.

13:39.193 --> 13:42.361
You two, pull warrants
and start to dig quietly.

13:44.814 --> 13:46.198
Let's see if we can
find a friend,

13:46.200 --> 13:47.366
someone she complained
about Michael to.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.618
Someone she told everything to.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.453
Is that what friends
are for? I wouldn't know.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.989
The flowers are from my dad.

13:53.991 --> 13:55.991
There is no secret guy.

13:55.993 --> 13:57.259
I swear.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.598
Is she gone?
Uh,

14:02.600 --> 14:04.383
I don't know. Is she invisible
and I'm the only one

14:04.385 --> 14:06.051
who can't see her?

14:06.053 --> 14:07.970
- So, keep her out until 9:00.
- Detective.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.337
And could you pick up

14:09.339 --> 14:11.306
the margarita machine
on the way over?

14:11.308 --> 14:14.059
Uh-huh. And just
how do you expect me

14:14.061 --> 14:16.862
to explain picking up
a margarita machine to Cat

14:16.864 --> 14:19.514
on the way to her apartment
on her birthday,

14:19.516 --> 14:22.367
which supposedly you promised
not to throw a party for?

14:22.369 --> 14:23.852
Good point.

14:23.854 --> 14:26.572
It's a match--
DNA of the hair and blood

14:26.574 --> 14:28.323
from a woman mid-to-late 20s.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.993
Sounds like Amy. What about
the prints from the newspaper?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.112
Yeah, I ran the prints through
the system, but they're smudged.

14:33.114 --> 14:35.297
I'll try and clean them up
and run them through again.

14:35.299 --> 14:37.533
Okay, mind if I print this?
No.

14:38.368 --> 14:39.802
Wait.

14:41.137 --> 14:43.422
The most eligible
bachelor with his

14:43.424 --> 14:45.207
I-can-bag-anyone-in-this-
bar-because-I-have-a-sexy-

14:45.209 --> 14:48.376
accent has reverted
to online dating?

14:48.378 --> 14:50.028
I didn't know you thought
my accent was sexy.

14:50.030 --> 14:53.515
Okay, so who is
this buxomly bimbo

14:53.517 --> 14:55.067
you've stooped to?

14:55.069 --> 14:57.436
Claire Sinclair?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.271
Really?
Is that her screen name?

14:59.273 --> 15:00.856
Likes hiking

15:00.858 --> 15:03.408
and reading. How original.

15:04.527 --> 15:05.911
Oh.

15:05.913 --> 15:08.147
A masters in poli sci...

15:08.149 --> 15:10.616
and a PhD in economics.

15:11.868 --> 15:13.552
Climbed Mount Everest?

15:13.554 --> 15:15.454
Well, maybe you should
open yourself up

15:15.456 --> 15:17.506
to the possibilities
of the World Wide Web, Cat.

15:17.508 --> 15:19.407
I'm not the one that's gone stag
to the Police Ball

15:19.409 --> 15:20.843
three years running.

15:21.928 --> 15:23.578
Evan.

15:23.580 --> 15:24.412
Heather.

15:24.414 --> 15:25.430
Cat.

15:25.432 --> 15:27.282
Now that everyone's met...

15:27.284 --> 15:29.251
What are you doing here?
I...

15:29.253 --> 15:31.770
um, well, Tess said
you were down here.

15:31.772 --> 15:33.305
I... locked

15:33.307 --> 15:34.890
myself out.
 Again.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.775
Could I borrow your spare?
I need

15:36.777 --> 15:38.927
to get you a set of keys
to wear as earrings.

15:38.929 --> 15:40.279
Seriously.

15:40.281 --> 15:41.530
Okay, come on.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.285
Margarita machine.

15:48.571 --> 15:50.455
Detective Chandler.
Here you go.

15:50.457 --> 15:52.107
From Precinct 86?
Yeah.

15:52.109 --> 15:53.942
Thanks.
No problem.

16:06.372 --> 16:08.640
♪

16:44.475 --> 16:46.945
Good news. No frame
of that video footage

16:46.947 --> 16:48.246
can clearly peg you.

16:48.248 --> 16:49.981
Your identity is safe.

16:52.485 --> 16:55.003
"Blocking analog"?
Shuts down any wireless devices

16:55.005 --> 16:56.505
in the perimeter.

16:56.507 --> 16:58.673
Thank you, JT.

16:59.675 --> 17:01.659
Your isolated prison

17:01.661 --> 17:04.930
is starting to feel
like my escape these days.

17:04.932 --> 17:07.516
You're not spending your
birthday on your own, are you?

17:08.519 --> 17:09.718
You at least need a pizza

17:09.720 --> 17:12.170
or a movie
or something.

17:12.172 --> 17:13.637
Are you buying?

17:13.640 --> 17:15.674
Theoretically? Yes.

17:15.675 --> 17:17.509
Technically?
No, that would be JT.

17:17.511 --> 17:19.027
The one with the paycheck.

17:20.113 --> 17:21.980
You're offering me
an entire night

17:21.982 --> 17:24.633
where I don't have
to make up lies?

17:24.635 --> 17:26.300
Yeah, I figured you could
use a break from it.

17:26.303 --> 17:28.502
I'll see you at 8:00.
It's a date.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.422
Not a...
not a...

17:30.424 --> 17:32.090
date-date.

17:35.828 --> 17:38.330
What is it with guys?
You could put up

17:38.332 --> 17:40.582
a picture or something.
It would make the place

17:40.584 --> 17:41.917
feel less like a prison.

17:41.919 --> 17:43.752
Why, is there something wrong?

17:49.492 --> 17:51.243
No pictures.
Nothing personal.

17:51.245 --> 17:53.311
It's part of
the To Go Plan.

17:54.647 --> 17:57.149
We can get everything out
of here that links to us

17:57.151 --> 18:00.519
in 14 minutes and be on our way
to the safe haven.

18:00.521 --> 18:02.554
Right, because you're
on the run,

18:02.556 --> 18:03.855
someone's after you.

18:03.857 --> 18:06.024
Did you say "safe haven"?

18:06.026 --> 18:08.610
Yeah, it's...

18:08.612 --> 18:10.895
JT's name.
I think it's kind of goofy.

18:10.897 --> 18:14.332
It's just a place we know
how to get around in, but...

18:14.334 --> 18:16.818
where no one would ever think
to look for us.

18:18.087 --> 18:19.721
What if no one was erasing Amy?

18:19.723 --> 18:21.840
What if she was
erasing herself?

18:21.842 --> 18:23.675
And she made herself disappear
in less than 20 minutes?

18:23.677 --> 18:24.843
That might explain
what the system kicked up

18:24.845 --> 18:26.595
when I reran the prints.

18:27.713 --> 18:29.631
Her name's not Amy.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.483
<i>Amy's real name is</i>

18:31.485 --> 18:33.768
Lily Carter.
Besides this driver's license,

18:33.770 --> 18:35.370
there's no other record
of Lily's existence

18:35.372 --> 18:37.389
before the age of 18--
no birth certificate,

18:37.391 --> 18:38.723
no Social Security number,

18:38.725 --> 18:40.925
no school records.

18:40.927 --> 18:44.029
You know, if we're keeping you
from your hot date...

18:44.031 --> 18:45.096
Oh, it's not a problem.

18:45.098 --> 18:46.364
She's waiting for me.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.750
Chandler, Vargas.

19:05.918 --> 19:07.385
JT Forbes!

19:10.623 --> 19:12.457
Sara. Hey.

19:12.459 --> 19:14.226
I, uh...

19:14.228 --> 19:16.628
I'm...

19:16.630 --> 19:18.780
sure you're wondering what I'm doing.
Yeah,

19:18.782 --> 19:21.116
you've been staring at me
during staff meetings.

19:22.318 --> 19:23.818
Uh... I-I...

19:23.820 --> 19:26.154
I... wouldn't...
I wouldn't call it staring.

19:26.156 --> 19:27.405
I'm...

19:27.407 --> 19:29.157
I'm farsighted, so...
Oh,

19:29.159 --> 19:30.909
yeah, well, uh,
I've asked around

19:30.911 --> 19:33.028
and apparently
you don't have a girlfriend

19:33.030 --> 19:34.579
or any kind of life.

19:34.581 --> 19:35.864
Supposedly you show up

19:35.866 --> 19:37.699
to faculty functions alone.

19:37.701 --> 19:39.817
I'm so glad everyone's noticed.
Yeah,

19:39.819 --> 19:42.871
well, I kept waiting, but...

19:42.873 --> 19:45.257
Do you want to go out
for coffee sometime?

19:46.342 --> 19:48.593
I, uh...

19:48.595 --> 19:50.211
I, um...

19:50.213 --> 19:51.546
I...

19:51.548 --> 19:53.181
I got to go.

19:56.018 --> 19:58.436
<i>Well, what was</i>
<i>I supposed to say?</i>

19:58.438 --> 20:00.355
Uh, how about "yes"?

20:00.357 --> 20:01.673
Wake up, Vincent.

20:01.675 --> 20:03.108
Uh, finger.

20:05.511 --> 20:07.729
Coffee leads to lunch,
lunch leads to dinner,

20:07.731 --> 20:09.064
dinner leads to drinks, and...

20:09.066 --> 20:10.365
we all know where that leads.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.033
Exactly. And you could do

20:12.035 --> 20:13.618
with some of that.
And what am I

20:13.620 --> 20:15.353
supposed to say
after three months of dodging?

20:15.355 --> 20:17.455
She can't come see my house
because...?

20:17.457 --> 20:19.857
I don't know. Because...
you live with your parents.

20:19.859 --> 20:22.494
Oh, that's studly.
That'll get me laid. Thanks.

20:22.496 --> 20:23.695
Okay,

20:23.697 --> 20:25.997
what if she was trustworthy?

20:25.999 --> 20:27.699
Okay, if she was...

20:27.701 --> 20:30.919
someone special that knew
about us and understood.

20:30.921 --> 20:32.671
I did that. Remember?

20:32.673 --> 20:34.639
I was that trustworthy friend.

20:34.641 --> 20:36.808
Lasted about a year.
JT...

20:36.810 --> 20:38.176
I had roommates and

20:38.178 --> 20:39.678
a girlfriend.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.763
They start asking questions
and you get caught

20:41.765 --> 20:43.932
lying to people
you love about where you've been

20:43.934 --> 20:45.200
and what you've been doing.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.152
It's not a choice.
You can never

20:47.154 --> 20:48.903
leave this secret behind.

20:48.905 --> 20:50.905
It's a lot easier
to leave your life.

20:53.776 --> 20:56.060
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

20:56.062 --> 20:57.579
But...

20:57.581 --> 21:00.749
bringing someone else in
like Sara...

21:02.268 --> 21:04.252
She might understand.

21:04.254 --> 21:06.871
First she'll tell
the little lies,

21:06.873 --> 21:08.239
then she'll...

21:08.241 --> 21:10.125
start brushing off a friend
here and there.

21:11.260 --> 21:13.128
It's impossible
to avoid. You know that.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.512
If we actually

21:14.514 --> 21:16.047
care about someone,
we can't let them

21:16.049 --> 21:18.850
give up their world to live
like this in ours.

21:23.189 --> 21:25.106
Witness Protection.

21:25.108 --> 21:26.941
Amy witnessed the murder
of her parents.

21:26.943 --> 21:29.361
The man who killed them got away
but his accomplice was caught.

21:29.363 --> 21:30.595
She testified and helped
put him behind bars.

21:30.597 --> 21:32.230
Then she was assigned
to WITSEC.

21:32.232 --> 21:33.431
That's why she
didn't leave any

21:33.433 --> 21:34.983
trace of herself
at that apartment.

21:34.985 --> 21:36.568
Marshal Gibson
here set up

21:36.570 --> 21:37.769
Amy's identity.
He's been her handler

21:37.771 --> 21:38.787
for the past three years.

21:38.789 --> 21:39.871
I'm taking those undercovers

21:39.873 --> 21:41.406
off Michael.
She saw

21:41.408 --> 21:43.158
the engagement photo
in the paper and ran,

21:43.160 --> 21:45.293
afraid her identity
had been compromised.

21:45.295 --> 21:47.078
That's when she called us.
Is she safe?

21:47.080 --> 21:48.213
Is she with you?

21:48.215 --> 21:50.331
I'm not at
liberty to say.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.584
But we will have to
touch base with anyone

21:52.586 --> 21:54.135
you contacted.
Any person who...

21:54.137 --> 21:56.638
gets onto her identity
could put her in danger.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.122
Thanks for your help.

21:58.124 --> 21:59.224
Walk you out.

21:59.226 --> 22:01.309
Well, it's 8:00.

22:01.311 --> 22:02.977
We're off the case.

22:02.979 --> 22:05.180
How about a
birthday beer, bud?

22:05.182 --> 22:06.765
Seriously?

22:06.767 --> 22:09.317
Grade school pageants
could act rings around you.

22:09.319 --> 22:11.820
Please don't tell me
it's a surprise party.

22:13.155 --> 22:15.857
Heather promised
that she wouldn't.

22:16.826 --> 22:18.193
Fine. What time?

22:18.195 --> 22:20.361
9:00. Act surprised.
Mm.

22:25.522 --> 22:26.747
You're early.

22:26.748 --> 22:30.017
I'm barely in the door.

22:31.199 --> 22:32.749
Uh, Phillips head?

22:32.751 --> 22:33.917
Yeah.

22:35.152 --> 22:38.488
Thing is, um,
I'm going to be late.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.357
Heather, against my wishes,

22:40.359 --> 22:43.126
is throwing me
this surprise party, so

22:43.128 --> 22:45.729
I thought I could stop by after,
if that's okay.

22:45.731 --> 22:49.232
Yeah, um, but you
don't have to.

22:49.234 --> 22:52.936
No, I, I know I don't <i>have</i> to,

22:52.938 --> 22:56.139
but I thought when the party was
over, we could still hang out.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.508
There's no reason
why I can't have

22:58.510 --> 23:00.861
one foot in both worlds.

23:04.315 --> 23:08.618
You know, that's what
JT said nine years ago.

23:09.403 --> 23:11.855
Um, look,
Catherine.

23:12.690 --> 23:15.542
Keeping a secret like this--

23:15.544 --> 23:17.878
it really takes
a toll on a life.

23:17.880 --> 23:21.414
I mean, we didn't know what we
were getting into back then,

23:21.416 --> 23:23.834
but, um, we really do now.
Vincent...

23:23.836 --> 23:25.302
I didn't save you
all those years ago

23:25.304 --> 23:27.921
for you to hide out
in a dusty warehouse.

23:27.923 --> 23:30.173
You know, JT and I
haven't celebrated

23:30.175 --> 23:32.826
a birthday
in ten years.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.563
I mean, who would
we invite anyway?

23:36.565 --> 23:38.882
Go to your party.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.067
You're lucky to have one.

23:42.219 --> 23:46.106
Vincent, I just wish
you could be there.

23:46.108 --> 23:48.725
You have a life.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.829
Go on, go live it.

24:21.943 --> 24:25.362
Surprise!

24:30.434 --> 24:33.453
Happy birthday,
big sis.

24:33.455 --> 24:34.788
Surprised,
pissed, or both?

24:34.790 --> 24:36.439
Ah, totally surprised.

24:36.441 --> 24:38.441
You look surprised.

24:38.443 --> 24:39.543
You shouldn't have done this.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.795
It's your Saturn returns.

24:41.797 --> 24:43.129
Okay, what else
would you have done--

24:43.131 --> 24:45.281
sat around and wished
you had a party?

24:45.283 --> 24:46.833
Hey, happy
birthday, Chandler.

24:46.835 --> 24:48.585
Thanks, boss.

24:48.587 --> 24:49.786
Hey, Cat.

24:51.121 --> 24:52.789
This is Claire.
Yes, I know.

24:52.791 --> 24:53.974
Nice to see you.

24:53.976 --> 24:55.058
Oh, have we met?

24:55.060 --> 24:57.727
No, but, um, I
feel like we have

24:57.729 --> 24:59.646
'cause Evan's been
talking about you a lot.

24:59.648 --> 25:01.481
That makes me sound
like a stalker.

25:01.483 --> 25:04.434
I've been appropriately
conversant about you.

25:04.436 --> 25:05.685
Margaritas?

25:05.687 --> 25:08.137
Mm-hmm, sure.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.073
So, uh,

25:10.075 --> 25:12.158
is it true that you climbed Everest?
Yeah, twice,

25:12.160 --> 25:14.444
but I had to stop
a lot to pee.

25:14.446 --> 25:16.479
In fact, I need to use
the girls' room now.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.147
Is it...?

25:18.149 --> 25:19.148
Oh, it's that way.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.333
Do you need a Sherpa?

25:20.335 --> 25:22.669
No, thanks, I keep
a spare in my bag.

25:25.507 --> 25:26.506
Why?

25:26.508 --> 25:27.991
Gorgeous,

25:27.993 --> 25:31.127
a mountain climber,
yet funny and down-to-earth.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.328
Obviously put on Earth to make

25:32.330 --> 25:34.598
all other women feel inferior.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.634
And those pumps--
I'd kill for those pumps.

25:37.636 --> 25:39.302
Am I allowed
to shoot her?

25:39.304 --> 25:40.971
It is my birthday
after all.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.389
Can we get drunk now?

25:42.391 --> 25:44.841
Yes, that's the spirit.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.893
You know,
Tess did help decorate.

25:46.895 --> 25:49.279
You did?
Shh.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.897
There's Saturn.

25:50.899 --> 25:53.650
Yes, I kind of figured.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.151
And do you know
what that one is?

25:55.153 --> 25:59.456
Um, Uranus hasn't been
funny since fifth grade.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.325
It's a star... for Mom.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.862
I figured she should be here
for your big party, too.

26:07.698 --> 26:09.799
Thanks, sis.
You're welcome.

26:09.801 --> 26:12.535
And thank you, Tess, for
completely ignoring my wishes.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.370
It's what we're here for.

26:14.372 --> 26:16.222
Where's Claire?

26:16.224 --> 26:18.475
Tightrope walking
across rooftops?

26:18.477 --> 26:21.878
- Here we go-- lime, strawberry, and shots.
- Ooh, yay.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.813
All right.

26:23.815 --> 26:25.214
To Catherine.

26:25.216 --> 26:26.716
Happy birthday.

26:26.718 --> 26:28.718
Cheers.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.437
Yay.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.607

Your ability to leave me
speechless is unparalleled.

29:42.926 --> 29:45.126
No one saw me, JT.

29:46.128 --> 29:49.014
Did she like it-- her present?

29:49.016 --> 29:51.049
I don't know,
she never got to open it.

29:51.051 --> 29:52.968
She was kissing some guy.

29:52.970 --> 29:54.603
What?

29:54.605 --> 29:56.337
Yeah.

29:57.558 --> 29:58.907
I can't blame her, though.

29:58.909 --> 30:00.809
I mean, I told her
to go live her life,

30:00.811 --> 30:02.677
and that is what she did.

30:02.679 --> 30:05.447
But I...
I don't really want to talk about it.

30:13.739 --> 30:14.906
Vincent?

30:18.027 --> 30:19.961
Vincent, you all right?

30:21.530 --> 30:23.798
Vincent, you all right?

30:23.800 --> 30:27.669

30:27.671 --> 30:30.422
It's nothing, I'm just tired.

30:30.424 --> 30:32.591
It's been a long night.

30:43.686 --> 30:45.053
Michael Walters?

30:45.055 --> 30:46.187
Marshal Chuck Gibson.

30:46.189 --> 30:47.689
It's about Amy.

30:53.228 --> 30:54.779
May I come in?

30:54.781 --> 30:56.748
I believe I'll be able
to answer all your questions.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.950
Please do.

31:09.712 --> 31:12.464
Hey, I got your call.

31:12.466 --> 31:13.632
What happened here?

31:13.634 --> 31:15.634
Neighbors called in
a disturbance.

31:15.636 --> 31:19.304
Signs of a violent struggle,
originates in the living room.

31:19.306 --> 31:20.605
Is this Michael's blood?

31:20.607 --> 31:22.023
It could be,
they're testing it.

31:22.025 --> 31:24.559
Looks like Michael put up
quite a struggle.

31:24.561 --> 31:26.260
Let's just hope he's alive
when we find him.

31:26.262 --> 31:29.397
Okay, so, when I touched base
with WITSEC last night,

31:29.399 --> 31:31.616
I wasn't actually talking
to WITSEC.

31:31.618 --> 31:34.202
My phone was wirelessly
hijacked for 20 minutes,

31:34.204 --> 31:36.905
so when I called WITSEC
to check Gibson's credentials,

31:36.907 --> 31:38.974
I was actually talking
to somebody in Jersey.

31:38.976 --> 31:40.041
If you were rerouted,
then where's

31:40.043 --> 31:41.826
the real Marshal Gibson?

31:41.828 --> 31:43.294
His body washed up
on shore yesterday.

31:43.296 --> 31:44.379
So, who the hell

31:44.381 --> 31:45.497
was in your office?

31:45.499 --> 31:46.881
James Mason.

31:46.883 --> 31:48.800
Wanted for the murder
of Amy's--

31:48.802 --> 31:50.785
aka Lily Carter's-- parents.

31:50.787 --> 31:52.303
Amy is the only one
who can I.D. Mason

31:52.305 --> 31:53.888
as the killer
and put him away for life.

31:53.890 --> 31:55.924
So, why take Michael?
Well, he assumes

31:55.926 --> 31:58.059
Michael is so close to her,
he knows all her secrets,

31:58.061 --> 31:59.761
like where she'd go.

31:59.763 --> 32:01.262
Mason will probably
keep Michael alive

32:01.264 --> 32:02.731
until he finds Amy.

32:02.733 --> 32:04.899
Question is, where
is Amy's safe haven?

32:04.901 --> 32:06.467
Safe haven?
Yeah, she lives her life on the run.

32:06.469 --> 32:07.969
There must be some
familiar place

32:07.971 --> 32:10.438
for her to fall back on
when she gets scared.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.990
Didn't Michael say
they were going

32:11.992 --> 32:13.608
on a honeymoon
in Rockland County?

32:13.610 --> 32:15.527
Um, according
to Amy's real file,

32:15.529 --> 32:17.112
she went to camp there
in grade school.

32:17.114 --> 32:18.279
Rockland County?

32:18.281 --> 32:19.531
What do you have?

32:19.533 --> 32:20.749
When we tapped

32:20.751 --> 32:22.167
Michael's cell,
there is a message

32:22.169 --> 32:23.752
from his credit card company

32:23.754 --> 32:27.005
saying some woman alerted them
to a fraudulent charge.

32:27.007 --> 32:29.340
It was made from
a Rockland County gas station.

32:29.342 --> 32:31.826
Amy was sending
him a message.

32:31.828 --> 32:33.878
When you can't call
someone directly,

32:33.880 --> 32:35.830
you have to find another
way to get to them.

32:35.832 --> 32:38.183
Amy was trying to tell Michael
where to find her.

32:38.185 --> 32:40.168
Okay, Rockland's 30 away,
we can't lose any more time.

32:40.170 --> 32:41.936
Let's get a full list of
those hotels and split 'em up.

32:41.938 --> 32:44.773
All right.
Okay.

32:57.454 --> 33:00.288
Tess, I'm at the Belmont Hotel.
I think I have a possible match.

33:00.290 --> 33:03.625
Unknown young woman in room six,
so, get here fast.

33:12.635 --> 33:14.919
Amy?

33:14.921 --> 33:17.922
My name's
Catherine Chandler, NYPD.

33:17.924 --> 33:21.509
I know you're scared,
and I know about James Mason.

33:21.511 --> 33:23.645
Please open the door.

33:23.647 --> 33:25.096
I want to help you
and Michael.

33:25.098 --> 33:26.681
I think he's in trouble.

33:35.024 --> 33:38.193
Maybe this is
hard to understand,

33:38.195 --> 33:42.013
but for years, I was living
with a secret identity,

33:42.015 --> 33:45.250
holed up in my
apartment, just terrified

33:45.252 --> 33:48.937
that someone would
come into my life.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.756
And when Michael
did, I got scared,

33:51.758 --> 33:54.843
and I tried pushing him away.

33:55.795 --> 33:59.798
Does that sound silly?
No.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.599
I knew I shouldn't
get involved with him,

34:01.601 --> 34:03.501
but I couldn't
help myself.

34:03.503 --> 34:05.937
I was drawn to him.

34:05.939 --> 34:09.274
And then I moved in,
and we got engaged,

34:09.275 --> 34:12.694
and I wanted that
life so badly...

34:14.563 --> 34:17.899
...that I forgot I'll
always be on the run.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.734
When I saw our
photo in the paper,

34:19.735 --> 34:21.402
I knew that I
had to leave.

34:21.404 --> 34:24.339
Leave him.

34:24.341 --> 34:27.275
Maybe this time,
Michael will run with you.

34:27.277 --> 34:29.377
He could never be himself again.

34:29.379 --> 34:30.844
Not a doctor.

34:30.847 --> 34:33.248
It's just too
easy to track.

34:34.917 --> 34:38.052
I could never ask someone
to make that sacrifice for me.

34:38.054 --> 34:42.623
You can't assume
what's right for him.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.392
Get back in!

36:10.636 --> 36:12.136
So what will
happen to them?

36:12.138 --> 36:14.021
They get
to come out of hiding.

36:14.023 --> 36:15.823
They're lucky.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.942
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

36:17.944 --> 36:19.660
It wouldn't
have been fair for you.

36:19.662 --> 36:21.579
Well, that should
have been my choice.

36:21.581 --> 36:24.449
I'd go anywhere
with you.

36:34.376 --> 36:37.211
Thank you for the gift.

36:37.213 --> 36:39.046
I found it on
the fire escape,

36:39.048 --> 36:41.665
but I wanted to wait
and open it with you.

36:43.385 --> 36:46.003
How was your birthday?

36:49.558 --> 36:51.943
Actually, it was horrible.

36:51.945 --> 36:53.945
I was standing there
with my sister

36:53.947 --> 36:56.614
and all of my friends

36:56.616 --> 36:59.066
and all of these people
who supposedly know me,

36:59.068 --> 37:01.185
and they don't... know me.

37:01.187 --> 37:05.640
They don't...
really know me anymore.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.367
Your life isn't here, Catherine.

37:16.369 --> 37:18.719
Half of it isn't.

37:18.721 --> 37:21.889
And I know,
because in the other half,

37:21.891 --> 37:23.641
I have to lie to everyone.

37:23.643 --> 37:25.593
Act like
I'm doing things I'm not,

37:25.595 --> 37:29.013
watch every word I say.

37:29.015 --> 37:32.934
Put up walls and then remember
where I've put them.

37:32.936 --> 37:35.353
Hmm.

37:35.355 --> 37:39.490
I realized that what I wanted
for my birthday was

37:39.492 --> 37:43.578
to sit across from someone that
I don't have to pretend with.

37:43.580 --> 37:46.080
That's you.

37:46.082 --> 37:48.399
No, I can't ask...
You are not.

37:48.401 --> 37:50.451
Vincent, I want to have you over
for dinner.

37:50.453 --> 37:53.737
Pull down the blinds, just
sit down, have a glass of wine,

37:53.739 --> 37:57.758
not have to...
watch my every move.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.011
Just... be.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.963
The only reason

38:01.965 --> 38:05.249
you have to watch your
every move is because of me.

38:07.469 --> 38:09.520
Besides,
I'm not the guy for that.

38:09.522 --> 38:10.972
You need the, uh, normal guy

38:10.974 --> 38:13.024
that can show up
to the birthday party.

38:13.026 --> 38:16.760
What makes you think
I want a normal life?

38:16.762 --> 38:18.896
What I do-- it isn't up to you.

38:18.898 --> 38:20.648
It's my choice, not yours.

38:23.268 --> 38:25.319
My sister's going out.

38:25.321 --> 38:27.071
I'll have dinner ready by 8:00.

38:27.073 --> 38:29.273
And unless there's...

38:29.275 --> 38:32.326
something else holding you back,

38:32.328 --> 38:34.912
I hope to see you there.
