00:12.045 --> 00:13.584
I have the Sagansky file.

00:13.652 --> 00:16.801
And, um, I refreshed
your candy bowl--

00:16.868 --> 00:18.839
just Ikes, no Mikes.

00:18.906 --> 00:21.917
Anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Newman?

00:21.985 --> 00:24.489
Oh. Genevieve, you-you
don't have to call me that.

00:24.557 --> 00:25.717
You've know me my whole life.

00:25.758 --> 00:27.059
I know, that's true.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.900
You know, once
I gave you a bath.

00:28.967 --> 00:31.804
Oh, just a reminder-- I'm
gonna be late tomorrow,

00:31.871 --> 00:34.509
so, uh-- I'm gonna be
visiting my uncle.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.444
Again?

00:35.512 --> 00:37.247
Every month for 30 years,

00:37.315 --> 00:39.718
ever since I started
working with your father.

00:39.786 --> 00:42.123
30 years? I...
Hmm.

00:42.191 --> 00:43.963
I didn't know it was that long.

00:44.031 --> 00:45.600
Well, have a good...
You know,

00:45.668 --> 00:47.402
back then...

00:47.470 --> 00:49.977
it was just your dad and I.

00:50.045 --> 00:53.785
I mean, it was <i> way</i>
before Ms. Goldsmith.

00:53.853 --> 00:57.496
He used to always call me
his "original partner."

00:59.037 --> 01:00.573
"Partner"?

01:00.640 --> 01:02.842
Oh, oh,
you've got work to do.

01:02.910 --> 01:05.748
Well, have a good
evening, Mr. Newman.

01:11.262 --> 01:13.903
Wilfred?

01:13.971 --> 01:15.741
Wilfred?

01:15.808 --> 01:17.712
Have you seen Wilfred?

01:17.779 --> 01:19.918
This is the second time
he's run away this week.

01:19.986 --> 01:22.125
You know Wilfred--
he always comes back.

01:22.193 --> 01:26.334
Yeah. I'm just nervous he'll get
picked up by animal control.

01:26.402 --> 01:28.806
Listen, can we talk?

01:28.874 --> 01:30.343
I-I kind of have
someplace to be.

01:30.411 --> 01:31.547
I'm sorry, Ryan.

01:31.615 --> 01:33.518
I shouldn't have blamed you.

01:33.586 --> 01:36.591
I mean, I was the one who
kissed you-- it was my fault.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.463
Hey, maybe we could have dinner
Friday night.

01:42.531 --> 01:44.904
Dinner?
Yeah.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.710
I need to get out
and start socializing.

01:46.778 --> 01:49.548
I've been cooped up in my house
for way too long.

01:49.615 --> 01:51.252
Plus...

01:51.320 --> 01:53.856
it'd be nice to,
you know, reconnect.

01:59.667 --> 02:02.638
Yeah, that-that...
sounds fun.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.810
Great. Now, if I could
only find Wilfred.

02:04.878 --> 02:08.215
I swear, I need to get him one
of those GPS tracking collars.

02:08.282 --> 02:09.550
I'll keep an eye out.

02:09.619 --> 02:11.089
Thanks.

02:17.302 --> 02:19.941
Oh, hey, mate.
What are you doing here?

02:20.008 --> 02:21.476
I was pretty clear about
needing some space.

02:21.543 --> 02:22.811
Just tinting your windows.

02:22.879 --> 02:24.613
Thought I'd do
something nice for you.

02:24.681 --> 02:27.084
As in, the opposite
of "ruining your life."

02:27.151 --> 02:29.322
Well, it's disgusting.
You can't even see out of them.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.092
Or... into them.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.261
Why are you hiding from Jenna?

02:33.329 --> 02:34.797
Dude, she's driving me crazy.

02:34.865 --> 02:36.700
Ever since she came back
Drew-less from Wisconsin,

02:36.769 --> 02:38.705
she's just so clingy.

02:38.773 --> 02:40.240
I don't get a moment's peace.

02:40.308 --> 02:41.809
Do you know what it's like

02:41.877 --> 02:43.578
to have someone constantly
demanding your attention?

02:43.646 --> 02:44.680
Ryan? Do you?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.282
Ryan, look at me.

02:46.350 --> 02:47.650
Ryan! Ryan!

02:47.718 --> 02:49.285
I just need a break.

02:49.353 --> 02:50.721
Well, you'll get one Friday.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.358
I'm going out to dinner
with her.

02:52.425 --> 02:54.126
Makes sense.

02:54.193 --> 02:56.361
Things are rocky with Drew,
so you're swooping in,

02:56.428 --> 02:57.868
hoping that it's
finally your chance,

02:57.932 --> 02:59.835
just like old times.
No, it's not.

02:59.903 --> 03:02.101
This is different.
I'm just helping out a friend.

03:02.168 --> 03:04.003
Camera?

03:04.071 --> 03:05.937
Binoculars?

03:06.004 --> 03:08.238
What's up, Nancy Drew?

03:08.306 --> 03:10.107
Nothing.
Ryan, if this

03:10.175 --> 03:11.775
has to do with binoculars,
I'm in.

03:11.842 --> 03:13.576
I love binoculars.
Everyone knows that.

03:13.644 --> 03:15.245
Come on, tell me
what's going on.

03:17.214 --> 03:20.046
Remember that guy from the woods
who called me a while ago?

03:20.113 --> 03:22.046
Yeah. He wanted you
to tell your dad's partner

03:22.114 --> 03:23.681
that the price
had doubled, right?

03:23.749 --> 03:26.216
I think I know
who my dad's partner is.

03:26.283 --> 03:28.282
So it's not that lawyer chick?

03:28.350 --> 03:31.185
I've already told you too much.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.821
Aw, come on, Ryan,
stop shutting me out!

03:32.889 --> 03:35.591
For the last time,
I'm not a trickster god

03:35.659 --> 03:37.425
trying to ruin your life;
I'm not Krungel.

03:37.493 --> 03:39.492
There is no Krungel!

03:39.560 --> 03:41.796
Come on, mate,
I'm just hanging out with you.

03:41.864 --> 03:43.733
Just let me tag along.

03:43.802 --> 03:45.936
I'm sorry,
this is too important.

03:46.004 --> 03:47.737
Come on, get out.

03:47.805 --> 03:51.175
No. I'm going, and there's
nothing you can do to stop me.

03:55.346 --> 03:58.318
Hey, Jenna!
I found Wilfred!

03:58.385 --> 04:00.420
You treacherous bastard!

04:00.487 --> 04:01.454
Wilfred?

04:01.522 --> 04:03.323
Wilfred, come!

04:03.390 --> 04:05.291
Goddamn it, Wilfred!

04:05.359 --> 04:07.193
Wilfred!
Get back here!

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:37.840 --> 04:38.906
Hey!

04:38.974 --> 04:39.840
Hey, you!

04:57.775 --> 04:59.277
Hey!

05:06.621 --> 05:08.356
You got me, Ryan.

05:09.725 --> 05:10.825
How you been?

05:11.994 --> 05:13.628
Bruce?

05:16.156 --> 05:19.389
You look different.
I did a cleanse.

05:19.654 --> 05:20.814
I feel fantastic.

05:21.101 --> 05:23.102
I don't want to gross you out
with all the details,

05:23.222 --> 05:24.902
but they take this huge hose
and they snake it right up...

05:25.142 --> 05:26.910
How do you know Genevieve?

05:27.426 --> 05:29.027
Who's Genevieve?

05:29.095 --> 05:30.496
My secretary-- the one
who made the drop.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.499
Damn. This latex itches.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.468
Why are you wearing makeup?

05:34.536 --> 05:35.969
What the hell is going on?

05:36.037 --> 05:37.834
It's called "prosthetics."

05:37.902 --> 05:39.968
And why do you think
I'm wearing it?

05:40.035 --> 05:41.969
Another game.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.337
Exactly.

05:43.405 --> 05:44.968
Did Wilfred put you up to this?

05:45.036 --> 05:46.601
Is he here right now?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:46.666 --> 05:48.866
That's the master bedroom;
no reason to go back there

05:48.934 --> 05:50.666
unless you're gonna be
sleepin' or sexin'.

05:50.734 --> 05:52.033
Wilfred's not here,
but he called this morning.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.869
Said he was bored
and wanted to get a game going

05:53.937 --> 05:55.939
'cause you wouldn't
hang out with him.

05:56.006 --> 05:58.237
Also, he wanted to get you back
for snitching on him

05:58.305 --> 06:00.373
to that hot little
blond chick, who...

06:00.440 --> 06:02.108
I hear is single,
so I was thinking

06:02.176 --> 06:04.477
maybe you could put in
a good word for me.

06:04.545 --> 06:05.478
Ugh.

06:05.546 --> 06:07.012
Hey, where are you going?

06:07.080 --> 06:09.112
Game's not over.
I'm not playing.

06:09.180 --> 06:10.581
I'm never playing
your stupid games again.

06:10.649 --> 06:12.352
I was supposed to meet someone.

06:12.419 --> 06:14.288
Maybe I'm not too late.
You forfeit?

06:14.355 --> 06:15.721
Whoo-hoo!

06:15.789 --> 06:17.289
I win, I win, I win!

06:38.475 --> 06:39.941
Figures you'd be here,

06:40.009 --> 06:41.908
exactly where
I told you not to be.

06:41.976 --> 06:43.577
Is there a problem, mate?

06:43.645 --> 06:45.081
I had a chance to find out

06:45.148 --> 06:47.250
who my dad's been paying
off all these years,

06:47.318 --> 06:48.351
and you ruined it.

06:48.418 --> 06:49.950
Well, I'm sorry,

06:50.018 --> 06:52.218
but you shouldn't have
ditched me with Jenna.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.754
Do you know what this is?
It's a GPS collar.

06:54.822 --> 06:56.655
Jenna wants to put it on my body

06:56.723 --> 06:58.222
so she can know my every move.

06:58.289 --> 07:00.452
That would make it impossible
for me to sneak away

07:00.520 --> 07:02.251
and hang out with you.
Well...

07:02.319 --> 07:03.818
maybe that's for the best.

07:04.987 --> 07:06.820
What does that mean?

07:06.887 --> 07:08.854
It means I still
can't trust you;

07:08.921 --> 07:10.987
and today is a
perfect example why.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.122
This was important to me,
and you mess it up

07:13.190 --> 07:14.630
with your ridiculous
game with Bruce.

07:14.657 --> 07:16.691
And now you're dribbling
all over the floor.

07:16.759 --> 07:17.892
Every time.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.459
Why do dogs do that?

07:19.527 --> 07:21.258
Ryan, what do I have to do?!

07:21.326 --> 07:23.191
How can I prove
my loyalty to you?

07:23.259 --> 07:24.890
I-I'll do anything.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.525
Well, for starters, you can
stop playing games with Bruce.

07:27.593 --> 07:30.793
Hmm. How about I send you one
of those fancy gift baskets?

07:30.861 --> 07:32.427
That's the deal, Wilfred.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.063
I'm tired of your games
messing with my life.

07:35.131 --> 07:36.731
Ryan...

07:36.799 --> 07:38.696
what you're asking...

07:38.764 --> 07:40.396
What, no more games?

07:40.464 --> 07:42.264
At all?

07:42.332 --> 07:43.764
All right.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.131
Promise.

07:46.795 --> 07:48.496
No more games.

07:48.564 --> 07:49.964
Now, wait just a minute.

07:50.032 --> 07:51.499
What are you doing here?

07:51.566 --> 07:53.165
Did you know he...
No.

07:53.232 --> 07:55.331
Spying?

07:55.399 --> 07:57.335
On my home turf?!

07:59.238 --> 08:00.504
Respect.

08:00.572 --> 08:02.736
You can't end the games now.

08:02.804 --> 08:04.636
Score's all tied up.

08:04.704 --> 08:06.036
Since when?

08:06.104 --> 08:07.768
Since today.

08:09.137 --> 08:11.639
Jesus.

08:11.706 --> 08:14.208
Did you crawl through
a window this afternoon?

08:16.143 --> 08:18.042
And you were bitching
about me messing up your life?

08:18.110 --> 08:19.979
Now, if you want to end this,

08:20.046 --> 08:22.282
that's fine,
but there ain't no way

08:22.350 --> 08:24.216
this ends in a tie.

08:24.284 --> 08:26.750
Mm, what are you saying?

08:26.818 --> 08:28.353
We play the endgame.

08:32.828 --> 08:34.227
Sorry, Bruce.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.897
No more games.

08:35.965 --> 08:39.437
Wilfred giving up games. Ha!

08:39.505 --> 08:41.905
Now, that's a joke.

08:41.972 --> 08:43.239
Get out.

08:43.306 --> 08:45.407
And stay out.

08:48.881 --> 08:51.480
You don't want to play,
don't play.

08:54.318 --> 08:56.088
But there will be an endgame.

09:01.427 --> 09:03.729
Oh, did you want
to see me, Mr...

09:03.797 --> 09:04.730
Oh, dear.

09:04.798 --> 09:05.831
Close the door.

09:08.270 --> 09:10.439
I don't know what that is.

09:10.506 --> 09:11.841
I saw you make the drop.
No.

09:11.909 --> 09:13.477
I mean, I don't know
what it's for.

09:13.545 --> 09:15.312
It's just something
I did for your father.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.948
How long have you been doing it?

09:17.015 --> 09:19.183
Every month for 30 years.

09:19.251 --> 09:20.951
And you never asked him why?

09:21.018 --> 09:24.320
Ryan, your father
trusted me completely.

09:24.388 --> 09:26.491
He told me everything.

09:26.558 --> 09:29.525
He even told me
about the black women.

09:29.593 --> 09:31.828
But this is something
he didn't tell me about,

09:31.896 --> 09:34.430
so he must have <i> really</i>
wanted it to be a secret.

09:34.497 --> 09:36.098
Who's your contact?

09:36.165 --> 09:37.969
I don't even know his name.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.873
He called this morning;
he was really angry.

09:41.941 --> 09:44.444
Whatever happened
totally spooked him.

09:44.511 --> 09:46.380
He wants the rest
of his money now,

09:46.448 --> 09:47.880
in one final drop.

09:47.948 --> 09:49.347
When?

09:49.415 --> 09:50.851
Uh, today, 2:00.

09:52.421 --> 09:54.422
Get the rest
of the money together

09:54.490 --> 09:56.122
and make the drop.

09:57.892 --> 10:00.894
Ryan, Wilfred ran away again.

10:00.961 --> 10:03.030
He's been gone for hours.
Again?

10:03.098 --> 10:04.565
Yeah, I don't understand it.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.133
One minute we're taking
a little snuggle nap,

10:06.201 --> 10:07.468
and the next minute he's gone.

10:07.536 --> 10:08.804
What about that GPS collar?

10:08.872 --> 10:10.606
I misplaced it before
I could put it on him.

10:10.675 --> 10:13.311
And after everything I have
been though, I don't think

10:13.379 --> 10:14.980
I could handle it if
anything happened to him.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.081
I-I have someplace
I really need to be.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.251
Otherwise, I'd blow it
off and help you look.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.587
Y-Yeah, okay.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.223
I'm... I'm sure he's fine.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.560
I-I'll see you later.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.631
Jenna, wait.

10:32.034 --> 10:33.500
I'll look for him.

10:33.568 --> 10:35.837
Thank you so much, Ryan.

10:35.904 --> 10:38.305
As usual, you're
always there for me.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.078
Hey!

10:49.381 --> 10:50.717
Geez, Ryan.

10:50.785 --> 10:52.651
I thought that was the cops.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.618
I can't afford
another pissing ticket.

10:54.686 --> 10:57.189
Look, I don't have a lot of
time, so let's cut to the chase.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.492
Are you and
Wilfred playing another game?

10:58.560 --> 11:01.329
We ain't playing no game.

11:01.397 --> 11:03.364
So you have no idea
where Wilfred is?

11:03.432 --> 11:04.767
I didn't say that.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.570
I got a pretty good idea.

11:06.638 --> 11:09.305
But if you want the info,
you're gonna have to outsmart me

11:09.373 --> 11:11.241
in a battle of wits.

11:11.309 --> 11:13.980
Oh, yeah.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.749
This is a little game they call

11:15.817 --> 11:17.784
"Moonlight Falling
on the Egret's Feathers."

11:17.852 --> 11:20.053
Don't ask me why
they call it that.

11:20.121 --> 11:24.393
It just boils down to whoever
eats a Post-it note faster wins.

11:24.461 --> 11:25.793
I told you, no more games.

11:25.861 --> 11:27.196
Suit yourself.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.301
Fine.

11:32.902 --> 11:35.271
I got to warn you,

11:35.339 --> 11:37.042
I'm pretty good at this game.

11:37.110 --> 11:38.344
All right, come on.

11:38.411 --> 11:39.679
On three.

11:39.747 --> 11:41.281
One...

11:41.349 --> 11:42.916
two...

11:51.329 --> 11:52.863
Oh!

11:52.931 --> 11:54.598
Ah, damn it!
That's not fair.

11:54.666 --> 11:55.900
I didn't have enough saliva.

11:55.968 --> 11:57.000
Where is he?

11:57.067 --> 11:58.800
He's down at the beach.

11:58.867 --> 12:02.273
Said he was gonna take
a leak on tower 24.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.898
Shit.

12:43.778 --> 12:45.478
Wilfred!

12:48.224 --> 12:50.051
Where the hell is Wilfred?
I just saw him

12:50.119 --> 12:51.453
through the window.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.787
I told you he was at the beach.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.389
Bullshit! I was just there.

12:54.457 --> 12:55.657
Where'd you park?

12:55.725 --> 12:57.725
I don't know.
Lot six.

12:57.793 --> 12:59.495
Lot six!

12:59.563 --> 13:02.264
Goddamn it to hell, that's it!

13:02.331 --> 13:03.565
That's the ball game.

13:03.632 --> 13:05.468
You two <i> were</i> playing a game.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.938
Not just a game, the endgame!

13:08.006 --> 13:09.610
And because your stupid ass

13:09.677 --> 13:13.317
couldn't just park in
lot seven, Wilfred won.

13:13.384 --> 13:14.586
I need a drink.

13:14.654 --> 13:16.254
I knew I couldn't trust him.

13:16.322 --> 13:17.754
Wilfred?

13:17.821 --> 13:20.324
Get out here!
If you screw up

13:20.391 --> 13:22.161
this second, I swear I'll...

13:24.329 --> 13:27.030
You're dribbling.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.067
Shit.

13:29.135 --> 13:31.235
I hate when that happens.

13:37.811 --> 13:39.577
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:39.645 --> 13:41.279
I already told you,

13:41.346 --> 13:42.914
that's off-limits.

13:42.981 --> 13:44.984
This is your bedroom, huh?

13:45.052 --> 13:48.355
What? I took in a stray and let
him sleep in my room for now.

13:48.423 --> 13:50.625
I thought it would be
nice to have a dog

13:50.693 --> 13:52.054
that didn't talk back
all the time.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.235
Wh-What are you
doing with that?

13:57.303 --> 14:00.336
That's, uh...
that's not yours.

14:00.404 --> 14:03.273
You know, I'm starting to think
that it wasn't Wilfred

14:03.341 --> 14:04.840
I saw through the window.

14:08.549 --> 14:10.586
Go get it!

14:15.123 --> 14:17.224
Stop!

14:19.093 --> 14:21.463
That's so good.
Oh...

14:21.531 --> 14:24.168
Oh, do it again!

14:24.236 --> 14:26.173
Chin!

14:26.240 --> 14:28.308
You're... you're a dog.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.009
That's crazy.

14:31.076 --> 14:32.873
Oh, you want more?

14:32.941 --> 14:35.574
I'll bop you on the nose if I have to.
No! No!

14:37.243 --> 14:39.146
All right.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.919
All right, Ryan.

14:41.986 --> 14:43.888
I guess the jig is up.

14:45.057 --> 14:47.755
Stand back.

14:47.823 --> 14:50.760
You ain't never seen
a dog shed like this.

14:59.906 --> 15:02.040
Bet you didn't
see that coming, huh?

15:02.108 --> 15:03.875
Holy shit.

15:03.942 --> 15:05.510
You're...

15:05.577 --> 15:07.479
y-you're...
Krungel's the name.

15:07.547 --> 15:09.381
So y-you're
the trickster god?

15:09.449 --> 15:11.950
You're out to ruin my life?
Yeah.

15:12.018 --> 15:14.419
And the damndest thing is,
I don't even know why I do it.

15:14.487 --> 15:16.688
It's just do it.
It's what I do.

15:16.756 --> 15:20.036
- Where's Wilfred? - Don't you have to get
over to your precious little money drop?

15:20.092 --> 15:21.025
What did you do?

15:21.093 --> 15:22.994
Well, I kind of drugged him,

15:23.061 --> 15:25.863
and took him to the
9th Street kill shelter.

15:25.931 --> 15:28.768
He's there now, and he
could go at any minute.

15:28.836 --> 15:30.369
Wilfred was microchipped
years ago.

15:30.436 --> 15:32.501
You mean this?

15:32.569 --> 15:34.705
Time to make a choice, Ryan.

15:34.773 --> 15:37.376
Either solve your mystery
or save your friend.

15:37.444 --> 15:39.713
It don't really matter,
'cause either way,

15:39.781 --> 15:40.681
you lose.

15:47.820 --> 15:49.721
Yeah!

16:04.068 --> 16:05.169
Shit!

16:05.237 --> 16:06.472
I missed him.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.642
For a good cause though,
right, mate?

16:12.048 --> 16:13.681
He was just here.

16:13.749 --> 16:16.050
He was Krungel-- I saw
it with my own eyes.

16:16.118 --> 16:18.982
I know you saw it, mate, but
if Bruce can wear prosthetics,

16:19.050 --> 16:21.583
who's to say he couldn't
also wear a dog costume?

16:21.651 --> 16:23.284
Are you sure it wasn't just
another one of his tricks?

16:23.352 --> 16:25.085
He brought up Krungel, not me.

16:25.153 --> 16:26.486
I told him about Krungel.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.086
He knows about all
that god stuff.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.987
God, I hate this!

16:31.055 --> 16:33.323
I'm afraid it gets worse.

16:33.391 --> 16:35.088
How can this be worse?

16:35.156 --> 16:38.692
You parked under the sign
at the kill shelter.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.760
So?

16:42.864 --> 16:44.197
That was a game, too?

16:44.265 --> 16:45.798
It was the real endgame.

16:45.866 --> 16:47.967
And Bruce won.

16:48.035 --> 16:50.368
Game, set and match.

16:50.435 --> 16:52.835
I doubt we'll be
seeing him again.

16:52.902 --> 16:55.370
I'm gonna miss him.

16:55.438 --> 16:58.238
You're gonna miss him?

16:58.305 --> 17:00.036
He drugged you and took
you to a kill shelter.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.837
Bruce plays hard.

17:01.904 --> 17:03.673
Tough competitor.

17:09.641 --> 17:11.309
You okay, mate?

17:11.377 --> 17:13.579
I'm just pissed at myself.

17:13.647 --> 17:16.617
I swore I wouldn't get caught
up in your games with Bruce.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.689
And that's exactly
what happened.

17:19.757 --> 17:23.361
I keep doing the same stupid
things over and over again.

17:23.429 --> 17:26.532
And I wonder why I'm in the
same place as I started.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.835
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Ryan.

17:28.903 --> 17:32.305
The first step in stopping
a bad pattern is...

17:32.373 --> 17:35.207
recognizing it.

17:35.275 --> 17:36.843
Wilfy!

17:38.280 --> 17:40.319
Wilfy!

17:42.289 --> 17:43.688
Oh...

17:43.755 --> 17:44.788
Ah...

17:47.427 --> 17:49.962
Thanks, Ryan.

17:50.030 --> 17:52.129
I don't know
what I would do without you.

17:53.397 --> 17:54.697
And you, mister,

17:54.765 --> 17:56.799
why do you keep running away?

17:58.469 --> 18:01.205
Do you want to come in
for a glass of wine

18:01.272 --> 18:02.672
to... celebrate?

18:02.740 --> 18:06.075
Uh, thanks,
but I'm really tired.

18:06.143 --> 18:07.842
Okay.

18:07.910 --> 18:10.577
But we're still on
for Friday night, right? Dinner?

18:10.645 --> 18:12.447
You know, I-I totally forgot.

18:12.516 --> 18:14.250
I've got a work thing
Friday night.

18:15.986 --> 18:19.088
Okay. Well, uh,
well, thanks again, Ryan.

18:19.156 --> 18:22.059
I... I can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.

18:22.127 --> 18:24.125
I'm just glad he's okay.

18:39.340 --> 18:41.506
Look, I know how
important it was

18:41.574 --> 18:44.709
for you to find out who
was blackmailing your dad,

18:44.777 --> 18:49.183
and I wanted to thank you
for saving my life instead.

18:49.251 --> 18:50.751
Of course, Wilfred.

18:50.818 --> 18:52.851
You're more important
to me than anything.

18:52.919 --> 18:55.252
And whether or not Bruce
is the trickster god,

18:55.320 --> 18:57.387
I trust you.

19:03.593 --> 19:04.926
Goddamn it!

19:04.994 --> 19:06.594
What?

19:06.662 --> 19:09.030
I know how to
find the blackmailer.

19:09.098 --> 19:11.602
What? How?

19:11.670 --> 19:13.807
Remember that GPS collar
I nicked off Jenna?

19:13.875 --> 19:16.910
Well... I slipped it
into that bag of money,

19:16.978 --> 19:18.879
and you can track him
on your phone.

19:18.946 --> 19:20.307
Oh, my God,
Wilfred, that's genius.

19:20.348 --> 19:22.018
Thanks, buddy.

19:22.086 --> 19:24.788
Wait. Why did you wait
until now to tell me?

19:24.856 --> 19:26.323
Well, because I was
gonna steal the money

19:26.391 --> 19:27.792
to buy some binoculars.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.394
You know how much
I love binoculars.

19:29.462 --> 19:30.929
And you needed thousands
of dollars to buy them?

19:30.997 --> 19:32.898
You know, they only
cost a hundred bucks.

19:35.404 --> 19:38.406
I'll never understand money.

19:49.944 --> 19:52.277
Hey. Hey!

19:52.345 --> 19:54.445
What the hell are you up to?

19:55.914 --> 19:57.581
I'm done with you, kid.

19:57.649 --> 19:59.718
Stay the hell away from me.

19:59.786 --> 20:01.519
Not until you tell me
what you're up to, Bruce.

20:01.586 --> 20:04.087
Bruce? Who the hell is Bruce?

20:04.155 --> 20:05.422
Don't bullshit me.

20:05.490 --> 20:07.391
Take off that disguise.

20:07.459 --> 20:08.860
Give it.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.301
Keep your hands off me, boy!

20:13.370 --> 20:15.373
You're crazier than your mother.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.344
Leave me alone.
