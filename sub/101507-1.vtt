00:21.931 --> 00:25.434
<i>Loves me, Loves me not,</i>
by Ali Silver.

00:25.467 --> 00:28.838
Once, I found a daisy
and I played a simple game.

00:28.871 --> 00:31.841
I picked off all the petals,
it didn't look the same.

00:31.874 --> 00:33.910
Loves me, loves me not.

00:33.943 --> 00:35.812
Was it really worth the sound

00:35.845 --> 00:38.681
to see all the little petals
like teardrops on the ground?

00:43.920 --> 00:46.188
Loves me not.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.201
Let me
get this door.

00:59.234 --> 01:03.673
Keep going, keep going, keep going, okay.

01:04.974 --> 01:05.875
Do you trust me?

01:06.809 --> 01:07.910
Yeah.

01:07.944 --> 01:09.244
Yeah?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.146
Okay, open your eyes.

01:14.717 --> 01:17.185
I must meet
your decorator.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.703
Uh...

01:33.736 --> 01:35.805
Might stain
your clothes, though.

01:35.838 --> 01:38.675
Well, we can't
have that, can we?

01:38.708 --> 01:39.609
No.

02:34.329 --> 02:35.530
Full moon tonight.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.432
Is that okay?

02:38.366 --> 02:39.736
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

02:39.769 --> 02:40.670
Aw.

02:46.042 --> 02:48.678
What's with the fake
beard and the crutches?

02:48.711 --> 02:51.546
Oh. Um...

02:51.581 --> 02:53.916
a buddy of mine needed a lift
to an audition the other day.

02:53.950 --> 02:57.352
- Oh.
- Left his stuff in my car in case he gets a call back.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.320
Oh.

03:00.790 --> 03:02.324
What is that on your windshield?

03:15.738 --> 03:18.373
I have no idea
how that got there.

03:19.809 --> 03:21.077
Aw.

03:21.110 --> 03:22.277
See you tonight?

03:36.692 --> 03:38.895
<i>Hi,
you've reached Eva Silver.</i>

03:38.928 --> 03:40.930
<i>Tip for the day:
write the bad things</i>

03:40.963 --> 03:42.665
<i>that happen to you in sand,</i>

03:42.698 --> 03:44.734
<i>carve the good things
that happen to you</i>

03:44.767 --> 03:46.602
<i>on a slab of marble,</i>

03:46.636 --> 03:49.571
<i>and leave a message at the beep.</i>

03:50.606 --> 03:52.875
Hi, Mom, it's me.

03:52.909 --> 03:55.477
How are you?
I was just calling to say hi,

03:55.510 --> 03:57.680
but I also wanted to tell you
that I spent another day

03:57.713 --> 03:59.749
with that guy
I was telling you about,

03:59.782 --> 04:01.951
and I think this one
is a keeper.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.020
I love you.

04:07.556 --> 04:08.591
Loves me.

04:10.860 --> 04:11.928
Loves me not.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.397
Loves me.

04:16.098 --> 04:17.566
<i>Loves me not.</i>

04:19.401 --> 04:20.435
<i>Loves me.</i>

04:22.004 --> 04:22.939
<i>Loves me not.</i>

04:24.539 --> 04:25.540
Loves me.

04:27.643 --> 04:28.811
<i>Loves me not.</i>

04:29.812 --> 04:30.813
<i>Loves me.</i>

04:32.648 --> 04:33.850
Loves me not.

04:36.118 --> 04:37.620
<i>Loves me.</i>

04:37.653 --> 04:38.654
<i>Loves me not.</i>

04:39.755 --> 04:41.023
<i>Loves me.</i>

04:41.958 --> 04:43.491
Loves me not.

04:45.027 --> 04:46.596
Give me the tennis bracelet.

04:48.064 --> 04:49.065
Loves me.

04:51.801 --> 04:53.401
Any one
in particular?

04:55.004 --> 04:56.939
All of them!
Let's go, all of them!

04:58.007 --> 04:58.975
Loves me not.

04:59.942 --> 05:01.077
Come on, all of them!

05:01.110 --> 05:02.444
Oh, shit, shit!

05:03.779 --> 05:04.747
Loves me.

05:07.650 --> 05:08.550
No. No, it's not...

05:13.823 --> 05:14.724
Loves me not.

05:34.877 --> 05:35.878
Loves me.

07:22.351 --> 07:25.021
Your name was
in his cell phone and photos

07:25.054 --> 07:27.790
that led me to believe
that you were his girlfriend.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.826
So I'm going to have to ask you
for whatever gifts he gave you

07:30.860 --> 07:33.662
to match them against police
reports of stolen items.

07:33.696 --> 07:35.898
Don't worry, you're not
going to get in any trouble.

07:35.931 --> 07:38.000
Also, you want
to check your credit cards,

07:38.034 --> 07:39.735
because he had
a rap sheet that included

07:39.769 --> 07:42.071
fraud and identity theft.

07:42.104 --> 07:44.572
I just wish life
would behave itself.

07:44.607 --> 07:45.875
And men.

07:45.908 --> 07:47.576
I don't have a rap sheet.

07:48.844 --> 07:49.812
Excuse me?

07:51.714 --> 07:53.749
You're sweet,
and you deserve better.

07:55.251 --> 07:57.753
Have you ever thought
about dating a police detective?

07:59.121 --> 08:01.057
You're asking me this now?

08:01.090 --> 08:03.659
I admit, it's
bad timing, but if,

08:03.692 --> 08:05.094
if I could have your number,

08:05.127 --> 08:07.663
after a couple of weeks,
maybe a cup of coffee?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.698
How do you know
I wasn't Bonnie to his Clyde?

08:09.732 --> 08:11.000
It's what I do for a living.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.205
Well, you already have my number

08:16.238 --> 08:19.141
on the cell phone,
and the pictures.

08:20.176 --> 08:22.211
I'll delete the ones
you're thinking of.

08:23.879 --> 08:24.780
Thanks.

08:26.115 --> 08:28.217
Babe, I got your 911
and came as fast

08:28.250 --> 08:30.886
- as I could.
- "Run, Forrest, Run Guy" is dead.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.790
- What?
- He got shot, 18 times, one shot missed.

08:34.824 --> 08:35.991
Holy fuck.

08:36.025 --> 08:37.993
I'm cursed.

08:38.027 --> 08:40.029
- You're not cursed.
- I ignore that little red flag voice

08:40.062 --> 08:41.864
because when we met
we were innocent kids.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.800
It felt like nine-year-old
Ali finally got a keeper.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.135
Come on, Ali.

08:46.168 --> 08:47.870
You find Brock
on Facebook and what?

08:47.903 --> 08:50.239
A month later you're going
through brides magazines?

08:50.272 --> 08:53.008
You were Phi Beta Kappa
and all that bull crapper.

08:53.042 --> 08:54.977
You should know how to navigate
this parade of men.

08:55.010 --> 08:55.911
Charade of men.

08:56.812 --> 08:58.914
You will do better, I know it.

08:58.948 --> 09:00.249
You're just
saying that to be nice.

09:00.282 --> 09:02.251
Does that
sound like me?

09:02.284 --> 09:05.654
Do you realize that there are
days I wish I was in your shoes?

09:05.688 --> 09:06.889
Mine?

09:06.922 --> 09:08.991
Yes, even though
you're a hot mess.

09:09.024 --> 09:11.293
My picker has just broken.

09:11.327 --> 09:13.129
You have freedom.

09:13.162 --> 09:14.830
I suppose.

09:14.864 --> 09:16.232
Thanks for not saying
I told you so.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.667
So you do remember?

09:18.701 --> 09:21.203
After the first time you met him you
said, "Run like he's a house on fire."

09:21.237 --> 09:22.705
But he wasn't a house on fire,

09:22.738 --> 09:25.274
he was more like
a candy store on fire.

09:25.307 --> 09:27.877
You know you should flee,
but it just...

09:27.910 --> 09:29.044
smells too good.

09:30.079 --> 09:31.847
Sorry, bestie.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.082
I love you, Veronica.

09:34.850 --> 09:38.888
So, I guess "Run, Forrest,
Run Guy" is "Dead Guy" now?

09:40.756 --> 09:41.657
Too soon?

09:43.392 --> 09:45.361
I'm sorry, come here.

09:46.262 --> 09:47.163
You got it.

09:50.032 --> 09:51.734
<i>We were supposed
to be surfing tonight.</i>

10:35.244 --> 10:37.513
I haven't discussed this before

10:37.546 --> 10:39.915
because, if I start
from the beginning,

10:39.949 --> 10:42.051
it'll take freaking forever.

10:42.084 --> 10:44.220
Remember, we're working
on naming our feelings,

10:44.253 --> 10:45.521
about our problem?

10:45.554 --> 10:47.923
Like we've done before
in single words.

10:50.826 --> 10:52.061
Humiliated.

10:53.262 --> 10:54.196
Unlovable.

10:56.031 --> 10:57.299
Worthless.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.934
Let's start with humiliated.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.370
It involves Dylan.

11:02.338 --> 11:04.273
Dylan from our group?

11:04.306 --> 11:05.374
We used to go out...

11:07.142 --> 11:09.845
but I wouldn't go
all the way like the others.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.881
I'd let him do
everything else, but...

11:12.915 --> 11:15.217
then he stopped
hanging out with me and...

11:15.251 --> 11:16.986
told me I was a cock tease.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.022
Come to find out

11:20.055 --> 11:22.157
he's actually been
throwing shit on me

11:22.191 --> 11:23.926
about certain private parts.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.130
Do you want to know
what he's been saying?

11:28.163 --> 11:29.798
Only if you think
it's important.

11:30.566 --> 11:31.533
I want to say it.

11:34.303 --> 11:37.172
He's been telling people
that I have really long lips.

11:40.843 --> 11:41.844
Oh.

11:42.945 --> 11:44.280
They call me "Lily long lips."

11:45.514 --> 11:48.851
I have no control
over what it looks like.

11:48.884 --> 11:50.819
Of course not.

11:50.853 --> 11:52.187
And it's bull anyway.

11:52.221 --> 11:54.423
We all come in different
shapes and sizes.

11:54.456 --> 11:56.525
Seriously, there is
no right or wrong

11:56.558 --> 11:58.193
when it comes to private parts.

12:00.129 --> 12:02.131
I read about
this operation online,

12:02.164 --> 12:03.365
labiaplasty.

12:04.466 --> 12:07.503
The important thing to think
about is to avoid anyone

12:07.536 --> 12:09.438
who would shame you
over anything.

12:12.408 --> 12:15.844
Do you want to know
the really messed up thing?

12:16.646 --> 12:18.480
The thing I want most
to happen now.

12:19.481 --> 12:20.449
What is that?

12:21.584 --> 12:22.985
I want to fuck Dylan.

12:24.353 --> 12:25.421
And I want him to love it.

12:28.490 --> 12:32.294
Many of us will pick
the worst ways to feel loved,

12:32.328 --> 12:34.163
desired, worthy.

12:35.931 --> 12:37.566
Now, I want you to read
this out loud every day:

12:38.467 --> 12:39.835
"I love and accept myself.

12:42.605 --> 12:44.006
Where I am right now.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.477
I am safe."

12:52.181 --> 12:53.949
I want you to read it,

12:53.982 --> 12:55.250
and practice believing it.

12:57.019 --> 12:58.220
And I'll see you on Wednesday.

13:03.325 --> 13:07.429
You know, I wish I could be
just like you, Miss Silver.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.132
You really have
your act together.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.066
Thank you.

13:16.405 --> 13:20.677
Meet the denizens of the Sandpiper
Apartment Complex in Malibu.

13:20.710 --> 13:24.980
Trust fund babies, models,
alcoholics, the lost people.

13:25.013 --> 13:29.251
Everyone looks toned, tanned,
and deceptively healthy.

13:29.284 --> 13:32.454
But I loved him,
he was so sweet.

13:33.455 --> 13:35.324
Should have known
he wasn't a bond trader,

13:35.357 --> 13:37.594
he couldn't figure out
the tip at a restaurant.

13:37.627 --> 13:40.329
He figured out
how to max out your Visa.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.531
Fashion show!

13:42.564 --> 13:46.603
Watch out when an Iranian
and a Russian joined forces.

13:46.636 --> 13:50.372
Everyone, I've had an epiphany.

13:50.406 --> 13:54.209
From this day forward,
I am done with all men.

13:54.243 --> 13:57.379
- You need a chick?
- I'd probably end up with a nightmare like you.

13:57.413 --> 13:58.347
Right.

13:59.481 --> 14:01.618
I love you too,
my green-eyed angel.

14:01.651 --> 14:04.987
I'm serious, abstinence
from this day forward.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.221
There's a Persian saying.

14:06.255 --> 14:09.258
Of course there is.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.494
You don't quit drinking water
because a glass once broke.

14:12.528 --> 14:15.130
You already know what
I think: Mr. Nice Guy.

14:15.164 --> 14:16.565
Ugh, too nice.

14:16.599 --> 14:18.233
But I thought you said
he was good in bed?

14:18.267 --> 14:19.636
That was Stalker Guy number two,

14:19.669 --> 14:21.403
not buying that horse again.

14:21.437 --> 14:25.007
Nice Guy had sex with about
as much improvisation

14:25.040 --> 14:28.243
as the formula
for the isosceles triangle.

14:28.277 --> 14:29.646
Will Finnegan begin again?

14:29.679 --> 14:31.346
I saw him in <i>US Magazine,</i>

14:31.380 --> 14:34.016
roundhouse kicking
his own father in the nuts.

14:34.049 --> 14:36.118
But I saw on <i>TMZ</i>
that he was clean and sober.

14:36.151 --> 14:39.087
I doubt that, all those years
in and out of rehab.

14:39.121 --> 14:41.323
Plus, you know how
shitty he treated me.

14:41.356 --> 14:42.257
Who is Finnegan?

14:42.291 --> 14:44.159
He devirginized Ali.

14:44.193 --> 14:47.095
You think that would be
vodka under the bridge by now.

14:47.129 --> 14:49.699
Some rotten experiences
you carry with you forever.

14:49.732 --> 14:50.999
Life is not fair.

14:51.033 --> 14:52.635
Women can fake orgasms,

14:52.669 --> 14:55.304
but men can fake love.

14:55.337 --> 14:56.773
- Poor me.
- Poor you.

14:56.806 --> 14:58.373
Pour her a drink.

14:58.407 --> 14:59.341
Mm.

15:03.345 --> 15:05.314
There goes another potato!

15:12.789 --> 15:14.022
Oh, shit.

15:14.056 --> 15:16.225
I'm not a narc, losers.

15:16.258 --> 15:18.460
We just assumed you
didn't want to participate.

15:18.494 --> 15:20.062
It's all right, dude,
you want a bump?

15:22.498 --> 15:24.233
- I'm good.
- I'm in.

15:24.266 --> 15:25.167
Me too.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.070
- Righty or lefty?
- Righty.

15:31.406 --> 15:33.208
There you go.

15:33.242 --> 15:34.142
Boom.

15:42.217 --> 15:44.052
Ali?

15:44.086 --> 15:46.623
Yes, trust fund baby whose
first words were room service?

15:47.556 --> 15:50.693
Stop bottom beating.
Give Mr. Nice Guy another shot.

15:50.727 --> 15:52.528
Have you been banging him?

15:52.561 --> 15:55.564
Not since I've
been seeing Dead Guy.

15:55.598 --> 15:58.233
- Rest in peace.
- Wake up, Ali.

15:58.267 --> 16:00.737
You're running out of runway,
and he's Nice Guy.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.111
When I forage for my food,

16:09.144 --> 16:11.648
it allows me to focus
on flavor and ideas.

16:13.282 --> 16:16.084
To reconnect into the world
that existed before we got...

16:17.820 --> 16:19.087
little too fast.

16:20.623 --> 16:22.625
In a really superficial world,

16:22.659 --> 16:24.794
it's hard to get
something that is real.

16:24.827 --> 16:27.362
So Instagramable.

16:27.396 --> 16:29.264
Can't have that level
of uniqueness of flavor

16:29.298 --> 16:31.466
unless you diversify
what you're using.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.235
Um, I'm all for diversity.

16:36.138 --> 16:37.640
Um...

16:37.674 --> 16:39.508
Get out, so good!

16:40.777 --> 16:42.077
Um!

16:44.479 --> 16:45.648
- Want more?
- Yeah.

16:54.924 --> 16:57.392
Ali, I'm not sure
why you shut me out,

16:57.426 --> 16:59.328
but I really missed you.

17:00.663 --> 17:03.700
I missed you too,
I'm glad I called.

17:03.733 --> 17:04.867
How about you move in with me?

17:05.902 --> 17:07.569
Whoa, no way.

17:07.604 --> 17:09.137
I know, I know it's fast,

17:09.171 --> 17:10.740
but you would love it here.

17:12.207 --> 17:15.210
Right from the first time we met
at that foster home fundraiser,

17:15.243 --> 17:18.146
you said that being a mom
was your greatest hope.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.783
My specific hope
was to be a parent

17:20.817 --> 17:22.919
to a child who needed a home.

17:22.952 --> 17:24.754
I figured
if you're okay to fostering

17:24.787 --> 17:26.555
you'd be open to the whole...

17:26.589 --> 17:28.190
nuclear thing as well.

17:28.223 --> 17:29.524
I think we're
getting ahead of ourselves.

17:29.558 --> 17:31.894
Cart before the horse
and all that.

17:31.928 --> 17:33.696
Listen, if you
didn't like living here,

17:33.730 --> 17:35.765
you could always leave.
No drama.

17:38.567 --> 17:39.534
Baby...

17:41.203 --> 17:42.337
when it comes to you...

17:43.940 --> 17:44.841
I'm all in.

17:48.611 --> 17:51.714
So what do you say
we get all in the pool?

17:52.715 --> 17:53.916
Charming segue.

17:55.517 --> 17:58.186
- It's beckoning.
- Oh, is it now?

18:15.805 --> 18:17.272
I have a surprise for you.

18:18.373 --> 18:20.242
Something that
I hope will turn you on.

18:22.612 --> 18:25.247
I always thought that maybe
you felt I was uptight in bed.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.916
No, Jake, not at all.

18:28.584 --> 18:30.419
It mean we need to be
more adventurous together.

18:32.354 --> 18:34.389
Meaning?

18:34.423 --> 18:36.759
Uh, I think it's time
to explore our fantasies a bit.

18:38.695 --> 18:40.328
I asked someone to come over.

18:41.396 --> 18:43.700
There is no romantic connection,

18:43.733 --> 18:45.467
so, if you're interested...

18:45.500 --> 18:47.704
Well, aren't you
the unpredictable one?

18:50.539 --> 18:53.910
When the hedges get trimmed,
the tree stands taller.

19:04.587 --> 19:05.988
And here she is right now.

19:06.022 --> 19:08.390
Ali, this is Jazmine.
Jazmine, Ali.

19:08.423 --> 19:09.524
My pleasure.

19:09.558 --> 19:11.493
Hi. Hi there.

19:14.496 --> 19:17.232
Why don't you, uh,
join us in the water?

19:33.683 --> 19:35.685
And there it is.

19:35.718 --> 19:37.787
You did say you're all
for diversity.

19:54.604 --> 19:55.872
Hey.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.707
I'm so sorry,
I should've told you

19:57.740 --> 19:58.808
before I sprang that on you.

19:59.776 --> 20:01.978
- You think?
- I wanted to be real with you.

20:02.879 --> 20:04.546
Doesn't mean I'm gay.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.015
<i>Not that there is
anything wrong with it.</i>

20:06.048 --> 20:08.383
I just think I need
some time to wrap

20:08.416 --> 20:10.887
- <i>my head around this.</i>
- Don't let this change things between us.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.623
Uh, I got another call, I got to bounce.

20:13.656 --> 20:15.892
Hey, will you still
think about moving in...

20:15.925 --> 20:18.393
Ah, shit.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.328
- Hello?
- <i>Hi.</i>

20:20.362 --> 20:21.496
This is Chris Perley.

20:22.932 --> 20:25.768
<i>Detective Perley, from the,
from the whole shooting thing.</i>

20:25.802 --> 20:28.403
You said that
I could give you a call.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.404
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

20:31.506 --> 20:33.776
<i>Eight-year-old
Margaret needs the stability</i>

20:33.810 --> 20:36.012
<i>and love of a forever family.</i>

20:36.045 --> 20:39.782
<i>In today's</i> Foster Friday's,
<i>we meet this resilient girl.</i>

20:44.954 --> 20:45.988
Dylan.

20:46.889 --> 20:48.891
- Hi, Miss Silver.
- Hi.

20:48.925 --> 20:51.560
I just wanted to make sure
you were handling this well.

20:51.594 --> 20:52.662
What?

20:52.695 --> 20:54.730
You know, the talk.

20:54.764 --> 20:56.032
It can be hard
hearing about things

20:56.065 --> 20:57.566
that are beyond your control.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.801
What are
you talking about?

20:59.936 --> 21:03.673
That they're calling anything
unusually small a "Dylan dick."

21:04.707 --> 21:06.508
High schoolers can be so mean.

21:06.541 --> 21:08.778
If you want to talk about it,
my door is always open.

21:40.109 --> 21:42.011
Miss Silver.

21:42.044 --> 21:43.913
Finnegan.

21:43.946 --> 21:45.547
I knew you'd still be in Malibu.

21:46.883 --> 21:49.051
You don't look
surprised or pleased.

21:50.052 --> 21:51.988
Uh. It's...

21:52.922 --> 21:54.422
- Can I come in?
- Uh.

21:56.592 --> 21:57.860
- Please?
- Uh.

22:02.198 --> 22:04.532
They let you
have animals in rehab?

22:05.835 --> 22:07.870
I'm in outpatient
sober living now.

22:08.804 --> 22:09.839
The dog is for you.

22:09.872 --> 22:11.040
I'm allergic.

22:11.073 --> 22:13.441
Oh, uh, oh.

22:13.475 --> 22:15.443
I guess I'll keep him
for myself.

22:15.477 --> 22:16.178
Um.

22:18.648 --> 22:21.017
So, uh, maybe you read

22:21.050 --> 22:22.785
that my dad and me
were in jail together,

22:23.853 --> 22:25.121
for assaulting each other.

22:25.154 --> 22:26.622
I may have seen
something about it

22:26.656 --> 22:27.957
in the rags
at the checkout line.

22:27.990 --> 22:29.725
What a perfect
Shanksgiving that was.

22:32.261 --> 22:34.462
That is when you spend
Thanksgiving behind bars.

22:35.197 --> 22:36.866
- Good to know.
- Yeah.

22:38.267 --> 22:40.036
Ali, uh...

22:41.536 --> 22:44.106
this is the longest
that I've been sober.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.741
I've gone through
most of the steps

22:45.775 --> 22:48.144
and you are on my amends list.

22:48.177 --> 22:49.645
About time.

22:49.679 --> 22:51.147
Why do so many of my exes

22:51.180 --> 22:53.182
wind up in rehab,
but never make amends to me?

22:53.215 --> 22:54.984
I'm trying to now.

22:55.017 --> 22:56.585
I saw the dog and some old guy

22:56.619 --> 22:58.087
was giving him away
across the street.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.555
I figured, that was a sign

23:00.589 --> 23:02.725
to tell you that
I'm really sorry.

23:02.758 --> 23:04.760
Aren't you supposed to take into
account that it might hurt me more

23:04.794 --> 23:06.128
to have to deal with you again?

23:06.162 --> 23:07.663
I'm pretty sure
it won't go like that.

23:08.764 --> 23:12.101
Listen, I have thought
about this for many years,

23:12.134 --> 23:14.170
and stayed away since
I was a mess for so long.

23:15.204 --> 23:17.974
I was an idiot back then.
Be glad I disappeared.

23:18.007 --> 23:19.875
Just because it was
a long time ago

23:19.909 --> 23:21.677
doesn't mean I forgot.

23:21.711 --> 23:25.247
You slept with me
knowing that I loved you,

23:25.281 --> 23:27.183
and left me waiting
for the call that never came.

23:28.317 --> 23:30.720
You simply vanished
like a guilty thought.

23:30.753 --> 23:34.123
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No, even that dog knows the difference between

23:34.156 --> 23:35.958
being stumbled over
and being kicked.

23:35.992 --> 23:38.194
I want to make it up to you.
I really do.

23:38.227 --> 23:39.895
Can you give me
my virginity back?

23:41.130 --> 23:44.300
Let me set things right. Please.

23:44.333 --> 23:48.137
At least let me try to help you
understand the why of it all.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.839
God willing, you'll, uh...

23:51.107 --> 23:52.808
give me a second chance.

23:52.842 --> 23:54.542
The last guy I gave
a second chance to

23:54.577 --> 23:56.746
ended up like Tony Montana.

23:56.779 --> 23:58.080
"Say hello to my little friend."

23:59.315 --> 24:01.684
You were always good
at imitating other characters,

24:01.717 --> 24:04.086
how are you doing
at being yourself?

24:04.120 --> 24:04.954
Ali.

24:07.089 --> 24:09.191
Is it really
a dog allergy or is it me?

24:11.327 --> 24:12.895
We'll see.

24:12.928 --> 24:14.897
You can call me
on my school line,

24:14.930 --> 24:17.133
and no stalking.

24:17.166 --> 24:20.302
Oh, uh, that, that is
good enough for me.

24:20.336 --> 24:21.971
- Bye for now. Bye.
- Bye.

24:24.306 --> 24:26.075
You checking me out?

24:26.108 --> 24:28.711
You may have changed, but you're
still full of yourself.

24:28.744 --> 24:30.246
Or full of something.

24:30.279 --> 24:31.814
I'll take that as a yes.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.582
Bye.

24:33.616 --> 24:35.651
And now he wants to take
you out to spread his bullshit

24:35.684 --> 24:37.887
as if it's the peanut butter
choosy mothers choose.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.723
And you'll fall for it,
hook, line and sinker.

24:40.756 --> 24:43.359
I do have a sweet tooth
for second chances.

24:43.392 --> 24:45.327
And third, and fourth.

24:45.361 --> 24:47.196
You've been on this merry-go-round
too many times, Ali.

24:47.229 --> 24:48.998
So what would you
have me tell him?

24:49.031 --> 24:51.267
I'd say what Clark Gable
never quite said:

24:51.300 --> 24:53.602
"Frankly, my duck,
I don't give a fuck."

24:53.636 --> 24:54.904
And ghost that douche nozzle.

24:54.937 --> 24:57.807
We were both only 16.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.843
Needless to say I didn't write
about it in the virginity box.

25:00.876 --> 25:03.379
But, maybe I could use
some closure.

25:03.412 --> 25:04.613
Maybe that'll work.

25:04.647 --> 25:06.782
Damn, I forgot about that.

25:06.816 --> 25:08.918
- What?
- Our virginity box.

25:08.951 --> 25:11.754
Oh, yeah! We painted
cherries all over it,

25:11.787 --> 25:13.823
and promised when either
one of us lost our cherry...

25:13.856 --> 25:15.257
We'd leave
a note in the box!

25:16.859 --> 25:18.861
I think I know
where it is.

25:18.894 --> 25:21.130
I can't believe you
still had it squared away.

25:23.299 --> 25:24.800
Now that is some dusty weed.

25:24.834 --> 25:27.336
Swiped from my mom's
secret stash.

25:27.369 --> 25:29.939
I can't believe we didn't
smoke or drink this all.

25:29.972 --> 25:32.041
No, we were saving some
in case of an earthquake

25:32.074 --> 25:33.409
or a nuclear fallout.

25:33.442 --> 25:35.277
Remember the first time
we got wasted?

25:35.311 --> 25:38.180
- It was like, 14, I think.
- Thirteen.

25:38.214 --> 25:40.916
Oh, and we tried to roll
a joint with a tampon wrapper.

25:40.950 --> 25:43.419
And you had this bright idea
of using notebook paper.

25:43.452 --> 25:45.321
Fuck off, that was your idea.

25:45.354 --> 25:47.857
"Qualities of a devirginizer."

25:47.890 --> 25:50.326
He must be hilarious.

25:50.359 --> 25:52.828
- Oh, ride gnarly waves.
- Love movies.

25:52.862 --> 25:53.996
Be humble.

25:54.029 --> 25:56.065
Wear boxers.

25:57.133 --> 25:58.367
Great dancer.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.835
Luscious lips.

26:01.003 --> 26:05.975
He must not be embarrassed
to make valentines with us.

26:06.008 --> 26:08.644
- Be a Scorpio.
- Be a Taurus.

26:09.879 --> 26:10.913
Um, look at this.

26:11.847 --> 26:14.216
And they lived
happily ever after.

26:15.151 --> 26:16.752
Now there is
some wishful thinking.

26:18.154 --> 26:21.123
- And the dog?
- Turns out he has leukemia.

26:21.157 --> 26:22.958
Started to take him
to chemo twice a week.

26:24.059 --> 26:25.828
There is a reason
he ended up in my hands,

26:25.861 --> 26:26.962
so I could take care of him.

26:27.930 --> 26:29.732
I really am allergic.

26:29.765 --> 26:30.666
Mm-hmm.

26:31.767 --> 26:33.936
So, do you like this place?

26:34.870 --> 26:38.807
It's just like the surf shop
we used to hang out on the PCH.

26:40.075 --> 26:41.777
Good times.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.145
I own it.

26:43.179 --> 26:44.813
Get out!

26:44.847 --> 26:46.715
My crew thinks that
I should put up posters

26:46.749 --> 26:49.051
of my father rocking
out on stage or something.

26:50.186 --> 26:51.453
The old school surfers
would love it,

26:51.487 --> 26:53.255
but I wanted this
to be the one thing

26:53.289 --> 26:55.090
that I did without
his shadow over it.

26:55.124 --> 26:56.825
So, I used the money
from that train wreck

26:56.859 --> 26:58.260
reality show to buy this place.

26:59.261 --> 27:00.296
None of it was his money.

27:03.232 --> 27:06.001
We used to talk about owning
a place like this one day.

27:06.035 --> 27:06.936
We did?

27:08.137 --> 27:09.972
Ali, I can't remember
all the things

27:10.005 --> 27:11.740
that I did to hurt you.

27:11.774 --> 27:13.509
A, you were
so coked up after prom

27:13.542 --> 27:15.811
you couldn't keep it
hard enough to finish.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.279
Then maybe it doesn't count.

27:17.313 --> 27:18.380
You made me bleed.

27:19.915 --> 27:21.383
It counts.

27:21.417 --> 27:23.452
And you lied to me
that it was your first time,

27:23.485 --> 27:25.821
but then I found out
about your devirginizing spree

27:25.854 --> 27:27.823
and that I was
just number whatever.

27:27.856 --> 27:28.958
I wished you were my first.

27:30.059 --> 27:32.394
Not some random who
really wanted to screw my dad.

27:33.462 --> 27:36.031
I was a consolation prize,
but good enough so that she could boast

27:36.065 --> 27:38.000
that she got it on
with the son of a rock god.

27:38.033 --> 27:38.968
I was 13.

27:40.903 --> 27:43.772
Ali, I went through all those women
knowing that you were different.

27:43.806 --> 27:45.507
That you were like an angel,
way too good for me.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.943
- Hardly an angel.
- Well, I made a pact with myself

27:47.977 --> 27:49.178
to stay far away to protect you.

27:51.013 --> 27:54.316
I have no excuses,
but I have my reasons.

27:54.350 --> 27:57.152
Did you have a reason
that you left me right after?

27:57.186 --> 27:58.320
Not a word.

27:59.822 --> 28:01.123
Where the hell
did you go, anyway?

28:03.092 --> 28:04.026
I went to a dealer.

28:05.127 --> 28:06.562
My father's dealer, actually,

28:06.596 --> 28:08.497
and the three of us
smoked crack all night.

28:09.498 --> 28:11.133
The start of a week-long bender.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.169
You chose drugs over me.

28:14.203 --> 28:17.239
Back then, and for many years,

28:17.273 --> 28:19.341
I would choose drugs
over anything.

28:20.976 --> 28:22.344
But not anymore?

28:22.378 --> 28:25.080
No, no, no, no.

28:25.114 --> 28:26.548
I'm alive.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.017
And I'm glad to be right here.

28:29.551 --> 28:30.452
Me too.

28:31.621 --> 28:33.355
I loved you then, Ali.

28:33.389 --> 28:35.524
I messed up
and I haven't forgotten it.

28:36.992 --> 28:38.360
I'm not asking
for your forgiveness,

28:38.394 --> 28:39.461
but maybe someday...

28:41.163 --> 28:44.199
Well, I admit, I,
I've been selfish

28:44.233 --> 28:46.235
to make assumptions
about your life

28:46.268 --> 28:50.239
and been blaming you
for all the loser men in mine,

28:50.272 --> 28:53.042
even though I've heard about
your troubles in the tabloids,

28:53.075 --> 28:55.477
and reading
your brother's memoir.

28:55.511 --> 28:58.180
Well, that gave you some idea of
the shit show that I went through.

29:00.149 --> 29:01.216
What do you say to a truce?

29:06.055 --> 29:07.556
Sounds good.

29:07.590 --> 29:10.125
Better yet, how about a do-over?

29:11.460 --> 29:13.128
Did you do
your homework, Billy?

29:14.930 --> 29:18.233
"Fears of a teen with
sitophobia and numerophobia."

29:18.267 --> 29:20.002
You got the names down pat.

29:20.035 --> 29:21.638
Yeah, I remember sitophobia

29:21.671 --> 29:24.039
because it sounds
like shitaphobia,

29:24.073 --> 29:27.309
- without the H.
- Okay, go on.

29:27.343 --> 29:29.445
"All of my fears come
down to the same thing:

29:29.478 --> 29:31.013
If I don't do things my way,

29:31.046 --> 29:32.649
then something
dreadful will happen.

29:32.682 --> 29:35.384
If the TV volume
isn't an odd number,

29:35.417 --> 29:38.153
then something terrible will happen.
If the TV channel isn't odd,

29:38.187 --> 29:40.189
then something terrible
will happen."

29:40.222 --> 29:41.624
So much for watching
<i>Bojack Horseman.</i>

29:42.524 --> 29:45.294
"If I choose a candy
from your box of them,

29:45.327 --> 29:47.262
then it has to be three candies
over and three down.

29:48.263 --> 29:50.132
Or I'll get a dreadful disease."

29:50.165 --> 29:51.533
You know what, Billy?

29:51.567 --> 29:53.502
Thoughts are just thoughts,
not threats.

29:55.337 --> 29:58.907
I, I can't go back on the meds.

29:58.941 --> 30:00.242
I already told my psychiatrist,

30:00.275 --> 30:01.644
they make me feel dopey all day.

30:01.678 --> 30:04.980
Okay, you know what?
Let's talk progress.

30:05.013 --> 30:06.315
Like the exposure therapy.

30:07.950 --> 30:09.084
Well, my mom couldn't believe

30:09.118 --> 30:11.086
that I only put my clothes

30:11.120 --> 30:13.355
in the washer once
instead of three or five times.

30:13.389 --> 30:14.624
See?

30:14.657 --> 30:16.325
That's terrific.

30:16.358 --> 30:17.594
You know, I think
you're ready for this one,

30:17.627 --> 30:19.194
otherwise I wouldn't offer it.

30:26.468 --> 30:28.270
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

30:29.571 --> 30:30.572
I, I'm not hungry.

30:30.607 --> 30:32.241
- Billy.
- No.

30:32.274 --> 30:34.677
My friend Veronica
makes these chocolates.

30:34.711 --> 30:36.311
I've seen her little factory,

30:36.345 --> 30:39.014
it's so clean,
you could eat off the floor.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.983
- Ali.
- Okay, okay, maybe you wouldn't,

30:41.016 --> 30:42.551
but let me just tell
you something, these chocolates

30:42.585 --> 30:44.420
are not going to
give you a disease.

30:44.453 --> 30:46.321
I can promise you that.
And you want to know what?

30:46.355 --> 30:48.490
They're really delicious.

30:48.524 --> 30:51.560
You can do it,
just close your eyes,

30:51.594 --> 30:54.029
anchor your positive thoughts,

30:54.062 --> 30:55.998
and pick a random piece.

31:19.589 --> 31:21.490
I bet I know what this is.

31:23.025 --> 31:25.160
Two free tickets
to that deprivation tank

31:25.194 --> 31:26.596
I was telling you about.

31:26.629 --> 31:29.264
- You should come with me.
- Oh, I'm claustrophobic.

31:29.298 --> 31:32.067
Two hours floating
in water in total blackness?

31:32.100 --> 31:34.269
It's also in blackness
that we see the light.

31:35.270 --> 31:38.373
Is that one of those
wise Persian sayings?

31:38.407 --> 31:39.308
Think about it.

31:48.283 --> 31:49.652
My lady.

31:49.686 --> 31:51.520
I see you wore
your best bib and tucker.

31:52.488 --> 31:55.524
And you look like a waiter
in a 1980's luau.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.328
Our carriage awaits.

32:03.432 --> 32:05.267
We're making
such an effort to find out

32:05.300 --> 32:07.670
if there's intelligent life
out there on other planets,

32:07.704 --> 32:10.272
but did we ever think that,
if it existed,

32:10.305 --> 32:12.140
they would be doing
the same thing?

32:12.174 --> 32:14.611
Trying to find us.
Think about it.

32:14.644 --> 32:16.779
The most important evidence
that we're alone,

32:17.680 --> 32:19.481
is that we are alone.

32:26.154 --> 32:28.190
We should go to church sometime.

32:28.223 --> 32:30.125
You do know I'm Jewish.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.327
Only half,
your mom is Christian.

32:32.361 --> 32:35.464
She married four Jewish guys,
Jewish by injection.

32:37.132 --> 32:38.367
Sorry, that was crass.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.669
You'll, you'll figure it out.

32:42.104 --> 32:43.539
Well, how about this Sunday?

32:43.572 --> 32:45.507
There is a potluck
and there is a band, and...

32:45.541 --> 32:47.543
You don't
have to try so hard.

32:49.278 --> 32:51.146
I'm sorry, I'm not used
to doing this sober.

32:52.147 --> 32:55.818
I'm just worried. Driver, turn this
thing around and let's get home and...

32:55.852 --> 32:57.754
Do you know why
we have this spot here?

32:58.855 --> 33:00.623
This indentation.

33:00.657 --> 33:02.524
Tell me.

33:02.558 --> 33:04.727
I was at this meditation retreat
and there was a shaman there.

33:04.761 --> 33:07.229
You believe in that stuff?

33:07.262 --> 33:08.263
I'm always searching.

33:09.431 --> 33:11.801
So, he was talking about angels
and I couldn't relate,

33:11.834 --> 33:14.303
so he said this thing
that rang true to me.

33:14.336 --> 33:17.674
He said, "Before we come
into this world as a baby,

33:17.707 --> 33:19.341
we already know everything

33:19.374 --> 33:21.543
about our past,
present and future.

33:22.812 --> 33:26.583
But, at the exact
moment of birth,

33:26.616 --> 33:30.319
an angel comes down
and goes: 'Shh...'

33:31.588 --> 33:33.155
So we spend our whole lives

33:33.188 --> 33:35.090
trying to remember
what we already know."

33:39.227 --> 33:41.129
Finn, you made your mark on me.

33:42.765 --> 33:43.666
Permanent.

33:44.634 --> 33:45.635
Like a tattoo.

33:46.568 --> 33:50.339
Bad tattoo, but hey, we were 16.

33:52.609 --> 33:54.543
And I'm ready for our do-over.

35:33.508 --> 35:34.677
I have a condom.

35:36.445 --> 35:37.680
We don't need it.

35:37.714 --> 35:39.314
Oh, I insist.

35:41.751 --> 35:45.655
We can mess around,
but not all the way.

35:46.789 --> 35:48.591
Okay.

35:48.624 --> 35:49.558
Why not?

35:53.996 --> 35:55.198
When I hit bottom...

35:56.565 --> 35:57.700
I found Jesus.

35:59.736 --> 36:01.938
Was he playing hide and seek?

36:03.973 --> 36:06.776
He came to me, he spoke to me.

36:06.809 --> 36:10.545
Oh. Eight billion people
and he spoke to you?

36:10.580 --> 36:11.714
He speaks to many.

36:13.916 --> 36:15.818
He showed me the way
and it's the path I've taken.

36:17.419 --> 36:18.386
I'm celibate.

36:19.521 --> 36:22.592
As in "you'll sell-a-bit"
and give the rest for free?

36:23.793 --> 36:24.694
I mean it.

36:26.528 --> 36:28.530
I know this is weird
coming from me.

36:31.868 --> 36:32.802
Finn?

36:34.369 --> 36:36.471
You said this was our do-over,

36:36.505 --> 36:39.776
like as in you'd make love to me

36:39.809 --> 36:42.477
on high thread count linens.

36:42.511 --> 36:44.046
As in you wouldn't
kick me to the curb.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.882
As in you wouldn't
disappear without a trace.

36:45.915 --> 36:47.516
I don't want to disappear.

36:48.584 --> 36:51.621
Ali, we definitely
have a connection.

36:51.654 --> 36:53.522
We could start
going to church together.

36:53.555 --> 36:55.457
There is a lot of cool
born-again couples.

36:55.490 --> 36:58.928
Two weeks ago, I suddenly found
myself speaking in tongues.

37:04.734 --> 37:06.669
We can still be naked.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.071
I'll even go down on you.

37:09.105 --> 37:11.107
Oh, how generous.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.543
I just can't go further
until you're truly committed.

37:14.577 --> 37:17.914
- To?
- Accepting Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.

37:19.414 --> 37:22.450
Sex is only for married couples
to create babies.

37:22.484 --> 37:24.620
I want us to go
to heaven together,

37:24.654 --> 37:25.888
but I'm worried about you.

37:25.922 --> 37:27.455
About me?

37:27.489 --> 37:29.725
Hanging out with sinners.

37:29.759 --> 37:32.028
Didn't Jesus hang out
with a prostitute?

37:33.029 --> 37:34.764
Hell is real.

37:34.797 --> 37:37.633
Ali, you can't compromise God,
it's in Revelation.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.735
God said, "Because you're
neither hot nor cold,

37:39.769 --> 37:40.903
I spit you out of my mouth."

37:44.974 --> 37:47.944
I don't want you to end up
in eternal damnation.

38:33.488 --> 38:38.060
Friends, lovers, losers,
lend me your ears.

38:38.094 --> 38:40.963
I come not to praise men,
but to bury them.

38:40.997 --> 38:43.465
New name for Finnegan, anybody?

38:43.498 --> 38:45.001
"Jesus of Malibu."

38:45.034 --> 38:47.603
- "Born again Finnegan."
- "Christ on a soft core."

38:47.637 --> 38:50.538
Oh, oh, Finnegan
won't put it in again.

38:52.775 --> 38:53.976
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

38:54.010 --> 38:55.945
I have something to praise to.

38:55.978 --> 38:59.481
Guess who has
the best dick in Malibu?

39:01.083 --> 39:02.885
Ali's brother, John!

39:02.919 --> 39:04.519
No!

39:04.552 --> 39:05.955
You didn't, oh.

39:05.988 --> 39:08.024
I gave him a grain job.

39:08.057 --> 39:09.524
What is a grain job?

39:09.557 --> 39:12.161
A blow job in a hybrid.

39:12.194 --> 39:14.730
That is so disgusting
on so many levels.

39:15.798 --> 39:19.201
I present to you my one
faithful girlfriend:

39:21.237 --> 39:22.204
Molly.

39:27.610 --> 39:28.911
Darling.

39:28.945 --> 39:30.512
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:35.251 --> 39:36.719
I'm happy where I am.

39:38.254 --> 39:40.923
Fuck it, I want to be
somewhere else, I'm in.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.061
I'm out.

39:46.028 --> 39:47.830
Oh, don't do me like that.

39:48.798 --> 39:50.900
Yeah, you're really ready
to be a mom.

40:12.254 --> 40:16.258
You'd have to be Rosetta Stone
to understand that.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.902
You want to try some things?

40:28.570 --> 40:29.872
Kiss me.

40:32.641 --> 40:34.944
So you can go to prison
for doing this?

40:34.977 --> 40:37.213
Oh, yeah, nothing
that can seem like dancing

40:37.246 --> 40:39.115
between man and woman.

40:39.148 --> 40:40.616
Between two men.

40:47.590 --> 40:49.125
No wonder you white tailed it.

40:49.158 --> 40:52.762
Yeah, the moment I got out
of Iranian air space,

40:52.795 --> 40:54.630
I tossed my hijab

40:54.663 --> 40:56.298
and I ordered champagne

40:56.332 --> 40:58.634
on my way to USA.

40:58.667 --> 41:00.302
God bless America.

41:01.837 --> 41:04.965
How long have I known you, Joe?

41:05.007 --> 41:07.968
Time is relative.

41:08.010 --> 41:10.637
And in all of that time,

41:10.679 --> 41:12.890
Have I ever asked if you can...

41:12.931 --> 41:15.017
You never asked.

41:15.559 --> 41:17.978
Are you able to have sex?

41:19.813 --> 41:22.524
Yes, why do you ask?

41:23.859 --> 41:27.029
Cause I'm diggng you hella heavy...

41:30.366 --> 41:33.803
You're not doing this
because you feel sorry for me?

41:33.836 --> 41:35.271
Because I don't
want anybody's pity.

41:35.304 --> 41:36.705
No, I'm doing this because

41:36.739 --> 41:38.941
it makes me feel good right now.

41:38.974 --> 41:41.877
I think we have a connection.

41:41.911 --> 41:44.113
Don't you think
we have a connection?

41:46.816 --> 41:48.651
Fuck, yeah.

42:20.983 --> 42:22.051
Hello?

42:22.084 --> 42:23.652
Hi, this is Detective Perley

42:23.686 --> 42:25.054
from the Malibu
Sheriff's Department.

42:25.087 --> 42:27.022
I hope I'm not
calling too early.

42:27.056 --> 42:29.391
No. Um,

42:29.425 --> 42:32.862
I'm sorry about
not calling you back. I, um.

42:32.895 --> 42:34.430
No problem, no problem.
I'm actually phoning

42:34.463 --> 42:35.898
regarding Brock Sheridan.

42:35.931 --> 42:37.266
I have something
that I think you'd want.

42:38.367 --> 42:40.870
- Oh, what's that?
- <i>Um.</i>

42:40.903 --> 42:42.404
Well, I thought
it must have been stolen,

42:42.438 --> 42:44.740
but it wasn't reported,
so I took a closer look

42:44.773 --> 42:46.275
and it was engraved.

42:46.308 --> 42:48.344
<i>Ali and Brock forever.</i>

42:49.845 --> 42:50.913
<i>It's an engagement ring.</i>

42:51.814 --> 42:52.715
Oh.

42:55.417 --> 42:57.119
It's, uh, here at the station,

42:57.153 --> 42:58.654
if you want to come by
and pick it up.

42:59.388 --> 43:01.056
Or I could bring it to you.

43:02.458 --> 43:04.727
Uh, could I call you back?

43:04.760 --> 43:06.896
There's somebody at the door.

43:06.929 --> 43:08.164
Bad timing again, okay.

43:08.197 --> 43:09.999
Um, well, it's
under lock and key

43:10.032 --> 43:12.134
so come by whenever you can...

43:13.235 --> 43:14.136
Hello?

43:20.209 --> 43:21.210
Ugh.

43:22.311 --> 43:24.213
What happened to you?

43:24.246 --> 43:29.185
Let's just say my party
went from ecstasy to agony.

43:29.218 --> 43:30.819
Consequences.

43:30.853 --> 43:33.389
Well, don't gloat
just because you were right.

43:33.422 --> 43:34.857
Plus, it was
a shitty thing to say,

43:34.890 --> 43:36.992
about me not
being ready to be a mom.

43:37.026 --> 43:39.361
Yeah, I thought
about that, wasn't cool.

43:39.395 --> 43:40.863
You're supposed
to be on my side,

43:40.896 --> 43:42.064
even when you know I'm wrong.

43:42.097 --> 43:43.365
I'm sorry.

43:43.399 --> 43:45.100
And I need a favor.

43:45.134 --> 43:49.471
I expect to see
some groveling first.

43:49.505 --> 43:51.273
Pick up Chloe
from school tomorrow?

43:51.307 --> 43:52.474
I have a convention.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.110
- I'd love to.
- Great.

43:56.345 --> 43:58.514
You know what, Ali,
what I should have said was

43:58.547 --> 44:00.449
you don't need a man
to complete you.

44:00.482 --> 44:02.851
You don't even need
a man to raise a child.

44:02.885 --> 44:04.086
I guess.

44:04.119 --> 44:05.988
- Guess?
- Suppose.

44:06.021 --> 44:08.757
- Suppose?
- All right, I know!

44:08.791 --> 44:10.092
Well then, pull your head
out of your butt

44:10.125 --> 44:11.160
and do something about it.

44:12.161 --> 44:14.797
You can handle it, I think.

44:14.830 --> 44:18.133
You know, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for a pity party.

44:18.167 --> 44:19.535
What else is wrong?

44:19.568 --> 44:21.804
Let's see, my goody
two-shoes doctor

44:21.837 --> 44:23.405
won't prescribe me
enough pain pills,

44:23.439 --> 44:25.841
my neck is killing me.

44:25.874 --> 44:29.111
And I got a marriage proposal
from beyond the grave.

44:29.144 --> 44:31.880
Dead Guy's ghost? Damn.

44:31.914 --> 44:33.816
Stay with me, V?

44:33.849 --> 44:36.452
I got Haagen-Dazs
and I don't want to be alone.

44:36.485 --> 44:38.120
You know I would if I could.

44:38.153 --> 44:40.322
I got to pick up Chloe
from a birthday party.

44:40.356 --> 44:41.257
Got to bolt.

44:43.058 --> 44:43.993
Love you.

44:53.535 --> 44:54.903
Aw!

44:55.605 --> 44:56.805
Baby.

44:58.340 --> 44:59.441
Got your message.

45:00.509 --> 45:02.878
I have solutions
to all your troubles.

45:05.848 --> 45:08.250
Ex-girlfriend is
an anesthesiologist.

45:08.284 --> 45:10.486
Still writes me
as many scripts as I want.

45:10.519 --> 45:12.554
We'll begin with OxyContin

45:12.589 --> 45:14.857
and Adderall,

45:14.890 --> 45:16.892
maybe some pot.

45:16.925 --> 45:18.927
Keeps everything smooth.

45:22.431 --> 45:24.066
Oh!

45:59.335 --> 46:01.103
<i>We party all life!</i>

46:05.608 --> 46:08.310
Hey dude, check it out. This is what
she was like for my appointment.

46:10.580 --> 46:12.147
Oh, my gosh.

46:14.651 --> 46:17.052
Oh, out for the count.

46:58.394 --> 47:01.563
Oh, fuck. Shit, shit, shit.

47:01.598 --> 47:03.499
- How could you flake on this?
- <i>I just...</i>

47:03.532 --> 47:05.300
I, I, I fell, I fell asleep.

47:05.334 --> 47:07.670
- I totally spaced. Is she okay?
- If it was just me.

47:07.704 --> 47:09.606
<i>But my child, your goddaughter.</i>

47:09.639 --> 47:11.573
- <i>But, but, but Chloe's okay?</i>
- I told you I couldn't be there.

47:11.608 --> 47:13.342
I know, I know.

47:13.375 --> 47:15.511
I, I'm so sorry.

47:15.544 --> 47:16.579
But is she okay?

47:16.613 --> 47:18.581
For fucks sake, yes, she's okay.

47:18.615 --> 47:20.382
<i>My ex mother-in-law was able</i>

47:20.416 --> 47:22.117
<i>to pick her up from school
before it closed.</i>

47:22.151 --> 47:23.452
She waited two hours.

47:23.485 --> 47:24.553
Anything could
have happened to her.

47:24.587 --> 47:26.288
Why didn't she call somebody?

47:26.321 --> 47:29.224
She fucking did call someone,
she called you!

47:29.258 --> 47:30.593
Check your damn messages.

47:30.627 --> 47:32.294
<i>I'm never going to
forget this one.</i>

47:32.327 --> 47:34.463
Veronica, I get it.

47:34.496 --> 47:36.165
<i>I said I was sorry.</i>

47:36.198 --> 47:37.299
<i>But you're making this</i>

47:37.332 --> 47:38.635
<i>something worse that it is.</i>

47:38.668 --> 47:40.402
The school wouldn't have
left her there,

47:40.436 --> 47:42.171
- they know shit happens...
- Are you seriously

47:42.204 --> 47:44.106
rationalizing your behavior?

47:44.139 --> 47:45.574
<i>You're selfish and delusional.</i>

47:45.608 --> 47:47.744
I get that you're upset,
but your coming at me

47:47.777 --> 47:50.078
loaded for a bear
with your barrage of insults

47:50.112 --> 47:52.014
- <i>isn't going to...</i>
- You want to hear a barrage of insults?

47:52.047 --> 47:54.016
Ali, look, I know you've
been through a shit load,

47:54.049 --> 47:56.051
<i>but the drama
and the drugs are getting stale.</i>

47:56.084 --> 47:58.187
You're acting like some
rebelling self-centered teenager.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.389
And you're acting
like a hysterical bitch!

48:01.356 --> 48:02.592
I don't want to be around you.

48:02.625 --> 48:04.526
<i>Are you serious?</i>

48:04.560 --> 48:06.328
After everything
I've done for you.

48:06.361 --> 48:08.330
And now to see how
insignificant I am to you.

48:08.363 --> 48:11.467
<i>How unimportant your
goddaughter has become to you.</i>

48:11.500 --> 48:13.035
Why don't you
and your Russian model

48:13.068 --> 48:14.269
just crash and burn without me?

48:14.303 --> 48:16.371
Ugh, you are being so extra.

48:16.405 --> 48:18.006
You wouldn't understand,

48:18.040 --> 48:19.174
<i>you don't have children.</i>

48:52.441 --> 48:53.743
You idiot.

49:08.257 --> 49:10.359
Detective, you scared
the bejesus out of me.

49:10.392 --> 49:12.094
Sorry, what happened
to your neck?

49:12.127 --> 49:14.096
Ugh, hard to explain.

49:14.864 --> 49:16.666
You came to the station
for the ring.

49:16.699 --> 49:18.735
I thought if I had you bring it
to me, it would be weird,

49:18.768 --> 49:20.135
like you were proposing to me.

49:20.837 --> 49:21.738
Yeah.

49:23.238 --> 49:24.506
I figure I'll sell the ring.

49:24.540 --> 49:26.709
Make sense. Dollars and sense.

49:28.443 --> 49:32.314
- Anyways, uh, thanks for the extra effort.
- Can I call you, Ali?

49:32.347 --> 49:33.850
That is my name.

49:33.883 --> 49:35.117
On the phone.

49:35.150 --> 49:36.518
Ugh, no.

49:38.788 --> 49:40.690
I mean, all right already.

49:40.723 --> 49:42.257
You can come by Friday at eight

49:42.291 --> 49:44.526
and try not to dress
like a detective.

49:44.560 --> 49:46.261
I'll come undercover.

49:46.295 --> 49:49.131
Or you'll cum under my covers.

49:49.164 --> 49:50.700
Oh, Ali, Jesus.

49:50.733 --> 49:52.835
Sometimes I have
diarrhea of the mouth.

49:52.869 --> 49:55.170
Sometimes I have
constipation of the brain,

49:55.203 --> 49:57.272
so, makes for a good couple.

49:57.306 --> 49:59.341
I'll, I'll see you Friday,
feel better.

50:17.860 --> 50:21.296
Hey, don't I know you from...

50:21.330 --> 50:23.532
well, I like to call
him Mr. Nice Guy.

50:23.565 --> 50:24.667
That he is.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.869
Looks painful.

50:26.903 --> 50:29.271
Oh, long story.

50:29.304 --> 50:30.272
Have a seat.

50:35.344 --> 50:37.446
- I'm sorry.
- For?

50:37.479 --> 50:38.615
For bolting like that.

50:38.648 --> 50:39.849
Only you left in such a rush

50:39.882 --> 50:41.550
you forgot your bag of weed.

50:41.584 --> 50:42.819
I finished it.

50:42.852 --> 50:44.486
Finders keepers.

50:44.519 --> 50:47.422
Jazmine, it has
nothing to do with you.

50:47.456 --> 50:49.726
I have kids at my school
who are gender fluid

50:49.759 --> 50:52.260
and every other combination.

50:52.294 --> 50:54.196
It was just that I,

50:54.229 --> 50:56.331
I realized that I didn't want
to share my man with anybody.

50:57.332 --> 50:58.333
It's just not who I am.

50:59.368 --> 51:00.903
But you're beautiful, Jazmine,

51:00.937 --> 51:04.439
and I love how you're
so comfortable with who you are.

51:04.473 --> 51:06.743
I wish there was somebody
as amazing as you are

51:06.776 --> 51:08.711
when I was back in high school.

51:08.745 --> 51:10.479
It would have saved me
a lot of shame, my...

51:11.446 --> 51:15.183
my dad, he was okay with it all,
but my mom... Jesus.

51:15.985 --> 51:17.687
When was the last time
you talked to her?

51:18.588 --> 51:19.956
It's been a while.

51:19.989 --> 51:23.258
I call mine, leave messages.

51:23.291 --> 51:25.494
I get to hear her voice,
even though it's just

51:25.527 --> 51:27.562
a recording
that will expire soon.

51:28.497 --> 51:30.667
How long has it been
since she passed away?

51:30.700 --> 51:31.668
Nine months.

51:32.969 --> 51:35.672
She's getting your message
in some kind of way.

51:35.705 --> 51:36.706
I miss her.

51:36.739 --> 51:38.340
Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie.

51:42.244 --> 51:44.212
Oh, my gosh, I got to go, hun.

51:44.246 --> 51:47.917
I can't be late for
my laser lady at Luscious Legs.

51:47.950 --> 51:49.752
Try saying that four times fast.

51:51.319 --> 51:52.822
Take care of yourself,

51:52.855 --> 51:56.291
uh, and if you see Nice Guy,
tell him I say, hey.

51:56.324 --> 51:58.695
And no hard feelings, seriously.

51:58.728 --> 51:59.962
Will do.

52:03.465 --> 52:04.466
Take care, okay.

52:14.509 --> 52:16.244
Those are
from the Ebigee Tribe.

52:16.278 --> 52:18.413
I got those when
I was traveling in Nigeria.

52:18.447 --> 52:20.315
It was a crazy trip.

52:20.348 --> 52:21.851
Do you, do you like to travel?

52:21.884 --> 52:25.353
Um, I don't get out much.

52:26.956 --> 52:28.858
Um, who is that?

52:28.891 --> 52:31.359
Oh, yeah, that's my father.

52:31.393 --> 52:32.929
He is so serious.

52:32.962 --> 52:35.397
He was a painter, composer.

52:35.430 --> 52:37.867
Needless to say I didn't
really take after him.

52:37.900 --> 52:40.268
But I love art,
and the symphony.

52:40.302 --> 52:44.774
Oh, he, um, was right in the
middle of this when he passed away.

52:44.807 --> 52:47.375
He always said:
"Art is a race against death."

52:48.543 --> 52:49.444
Um.

52:50.378 --> 52:52.815
Looks like he lost
the race right there.

52:56.586 --> 52:59.055
- Okay, you ready?
- Uh, maybe.

53:01.356 --> 53:03.492
Which would you choose,

53:03.525 --> 53:05.360
be alone for the rest
of your life,

53:05.393 --> 53:07.930
or surrounded
by annoying people?

53:07.964 --> 53:10.700
I am surrounded
by annoying people.

53:10.733 --> 53:13.468
- Present company excepted.
- Thank you.

53:13.502 --> 53:14.904
And I am alone.

53:14.937 --> 53:16.471
Present company excepted.

53:18.074 --> 53:19.574
My turn.

53:19.609 --> 53:21.010
Which would you choose...

53:22.344 --> 53:24.513
to smoke 50 cigarettes in a row

53:24.546 --> 53:27.449
or drink 12 beers in a row?

53:27.482 --> 53:31.353
That's going to be tough, because
I've never had a cigarette or a beer.

53:31.386 --> 53:32.088
Shut up.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.523
No beer, no pot.

53:34.556 --> 53:36.859
Never had a cup
of coffee, an aspirin.

53:36.893 --> 53:38.795
And I've never missed
a morning run.

53:38.828 --> 53:41.798
- Um, Clean Marine.
- Yeah.

53:41.831 --> 53:44.033
I bet my wine
was a big fail then.

53:44.066 --> 53:46.903
Uh, no, it's just,

53:46.936 --> 53:49.639
see, my mom was addicted
to all of them.

53:49.672 --> 53:51.941
So I swore to myself I'd never
let anything control me.

53:54.677 --> 53:57.013
Okay, um, next.

53:58.848 --> 54:00.716
Which would you choose,

54:00.750 --> 54:02.585
have your best friend
catch you lying

54:02.618 --> 54:04.720
or lie to your best friend?

54:04.754 --> 54:06.454
Um.

54:06.488 --> 54:07.957
I'd hate to be caught lying, so,

54:07.990 --> 54:10.092
assuming that is the worst.

54:10.126 --> 54:11.594
I've never lied
to my best friend,

54:11.627 --> 54:13.129
but I have lied for her.

54:13.162 --> 54:14.462
I sense a story coming on.

54:14.496 --> 54:15.798
No, no, I mean,

54:15.832 --> 54:17.499
I haven't told anybody about it,

54:17.532 --> 54:19.135
except my best friend,
because she was there.

54:19.168 --> 54:20.502
But top secret.

54:20.535 --> 54:21.804
It's okay.

54:21.838 --> 54:23.105
All good,
you don't have to tell me.

54:24.173 --> 54:27.844
I mean, I opened up
about my mom and everything.

54:27.877 --> 54:30.378
- It's okay, I mean, it's okay.
- Fine, I'll tell you.

54:30.412 --> 54:31.914
- Okay.
- Don't say anything.

54:32.949 --> 54:35.585
I was hanging out by the pool
with my best friend

54:35.618 --> 54:38.621
and her daughter Chloe,
we're just chilling.

54:38.654 --> 54:40.857
And I went inside
to use the bathroom

54:40.890 --> 54:44.126
and when I came out,
my best friend was asleep

54:44.160 --> 54:47.930
and her daughter was
face down in the pool.

54:48.931 --> 54:51.133
I had to do mouth
to mouth and everything,

54:51.167 --> 54:52.467
it was really bad.

54:52.500 --> 54:53.836
And how is the kid?

54:53.870 --> 54:55.905
She's good,
but it was a close call.

54:55.938 --> 54:58.040
- You did good.
- Thank you.

54:58.074 --> 55:00.142
But then, her husband came home

55:00.176 --> 55:02.011
and their marriage
was already on the rocks,

55:02.044 --> 55:04.080
and I knew if he found out
he would hold it against her,

55:04.113 --> 55:07.449
so I lied to him
and said that I fell asleep

55:07.482 --> 55:10.552
and that she saved her kid.

55:10.586 --> 55:13.555
You took the fall,
I mean, that's a good friend.

55:13.589 --> 55:15.958
Thanks, I love her.

55:15.992 --> 55:18.961
Can I ask you, do you ever
want to have children?

55:18.995 --> 55:21.163
I, I can't.

55:21.197 --> 55:24.100
Thank you,
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome.

55:28.704 --> 55:31.473
Um, if you want to have some
wine, it's fine with me. I'm...

55:31.506 --> 55:33.209
- It's okay, it's fine. It's okay.
- No, no, no.

55:33.242 --> 55:34.944
If you can go
your whole life without it,

55:34.977 --> 55:37.046
I don't need to have
a glass of wine.

55:37.079 --> 55:38.614
I'm curious about something.

55:40.016 --> 55:42.184
You know what
that did to the cat.

55:43.753 --> 55:45.621
From what I've seen,
your choice in suitors

55:45.655 --> 55:47.657
is not to be relied on.

55:49.491 --> 55:50.425
Why is that?

55:54.096 --> 55:56.799
As Princess Leia said
in the garbage compactor scene,

55:56.832 --> 55:57.833
"It's not over yet."

55:57.867 --> 55:59.936
Oh, that's good,

55:59.969 --> 56:01.871
because I can be relied on.

56:06.108 --> 56:08.443
- No crap, Kojak?
- No, no crap.

56:19.956 --> 56:21.657
I never thought I would actually

56:21.691 --> 56:24.160
get to say this literally,

56:24.193 --> 56:26.696
but is there a gun
in your pocket

56:26.729 --> 56:28.698
or are you just happy with me?

56:28.731 --> 56:29.832
Which would you choose?

56:37.707 --> 56:38.607
Ali?

56:39.608 --> 56:41.043
I never sleep with a woman
on the first date.

56:42.278 --> 56:44.512
I'm really hoping
there is going to be a second.

56:47.083 --> 56:48.851
You really do have self-control.

56:55.557 --> 56:56.926
Yeah, dude,
check it out,

56:56.959 --> 56:58.661
this is what she was
like for my appointment.

56:59.962 --> 57:02.231
Oh, out for the count.

57:10.106 --> 57:12.041
Someone linked it up
to the school home page.

57:17.213 --> 57:18.114
No comment?

57:19.982 --> 57:21.183
Maybe I did hire you too young.

57:21.217 --> 57:23.019
I'm processing.

57:24.920 --> 57:26.822
Look, we both know
nothing happens on this campus

57:26.856 --> 57:28.591
without me being aware of it.

57:28.624 --> 57:30.659
This is what I do,
I'm here, I'm present.

57:30.693 --> 57:31.827
25 years sober.

57:33.262 --> 57:34.797
And here is the rub.

57:34.830 --> 57:36.564
It's out of my hands now.

57:36.599 --> 57:38.267
Now that everybody's seen it,

57:38.300 --> 57:39.969
I'm going to have to explain it
to the school board

57:40.002 --> 57:41.569
and to Supervisor Gibbs.

57:44.974 --> 57:47.243
You know it's guilty until proven
innocent with that bunch of piranhas.

57:47.276 --> 57:50.780
- Am I on trial for napping?
- No.

57:50.813 --> 57:52.948
But you will be
for taking this too lightly.

57:52.982 --> 57:54.817
How in the hell did
you get yourself caught up

57:54.850 --> 57:56.852
in such an awkward
situation in the first place?

57:56.886 --> 57:59.088
I fell asleep in my office.

57:59.121 --> 58:02.091
I was in a lot of pain,
and I needed a quick cat nap.

58:02.124 --> 58:05.661
And you didn't notice somebody
filming you from head to toe?

58:05.694 --> 58:07.029
That is not some kind
of safe napping.

58:08.097 --> 58:09.598
And what happened to your neck?

58:09.632 --> 58:11.067
I don't feel that is pertinent.

58:11.100 --> 58:12.668
Incorrect!

58:12.701 --> 58:14.103
If you're under medication
while on the job,

58:14.136 --> 58:15.704
you must log in with the nurse,

58:15.738 --> 58:17.206
along with the doctor's
prescription.

58:17.239 --> 58:18.974
And that is pertinent.

58:19.008 --> 58:20.810
Do you realize the legalities
I have to go through

58:20.843 --> 58:22.144
on a daily basis
with the parents here?

58:37.760 --> 58:38.994
Principal Davis?

58:41.330 --> 58:43.599
Once you've seen
somebody run over by a bus...

58:44.667 --> 58:46.869
it's hard to figure out what to
do with the rest of your day.

58:46.902 --> 58:48.304
My God, you did?

58:51.941 --> 58:54.677
I saw her on the sidewalk
with her walker.

58:56.378 --> 58:58.681
I guess the bus driver didn't.

58:58.714 --> 58:59.715
And just like that,

59:00.416 --> 59:01.350
game over.

59:02.685 --> 59:05.321
I think you should go home,

59:05.354 --> 59:08.357
I think you're
in a mild state of shock.

59:08.390 --> 59:09.892
I got to shake this off.

59:10.926 --> 59:12.294
Do the best I can for my kids.

59:14.130 --> 59:17.433
Well, I assure you
this will not happen again.

59:17.466 --> 59:19.034
See that old lady
run over by a bus?

59:19.068 --> 59:20.302
My situation.

59:20.336 --> 59:21.937
I, I promise, Principal Davis,

59:21.971 --> 59:23.906
I, I will make sure to log

59:23.939 --> 59:26.108
all medication in
with the nurse.

59:27.776 --> 59:30.179
Maybe it's time
you took inventory,

59:30.212 --> 59:32.314
and figure out your part
in this fiasco.

59:34.150 --> 59:35.851
Meaning what?

59:37.353 --> 59:39.088
Meaning that, if you got
kittens in the oven,

59:39.121 --> 59:40.055
you don't call them muffins.

59:44.126 --> 59:47.930
If it's not dark chocolate,
there's no point.

59:47.963 --> 59:49.398
What?

59:49.431 --> 59:52.401
I finally found
my Clean Marine's "oholic,"

59:52.434 --> 59:54.470
as in chocoholic.

59:54.503 --> 59:58.040
Buyer beware, life won't
be worth living in 2021.

59:58.073 --> 59:59.742
Oh, why is that?

59:59.775 --> 1:00:01.143
It's when the world's supply

1:00:01.177 --> 1:00:03.345
of sustainable cocoa
will be devastated.

1:00:03.379 --> 1:00:05.748
There will be a global
chocolate drought.

1:00:05.781 --> 1:00:07.349
Um, the clock is ticking.

1:00:10.186 --> 1:00:11.787
You got to get it while you can.

1:00:26.869 --> 1:00:28.704
- Chocolatey.
- Very.

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:40.149
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Oh.

1:00:42.251 --> 1:00:44.420
I don't know, can you?

1:00:44.453 --> 1:00:47.056
I hated when my teacher
would say that to me.

1:00:47.089 --> 1:00:49.491
- Right. It's so evil.
- Yeah. The worst.

1:00:50.826 --> 1:00:52.161
- It's just down the hall.
- Okay.

1:01:21.523 --> 1:01:22.424
Ali.

1:01:23.593 --> 1:01:24.793
Is everything okay?

1:01:24.827 --> 1:01:25.794
Um.

1:01:29.565 --> 1:01:31.867
Okay, whatever you have
to say, just say it.

1:01:31.900 --> 1:01:33.869
Okay, um.

1:01:36.171 --> 1:01:38.107
Ali, what we've started
can't last.

1:01:38.140 --> 1:01:40.075
Your world is just too crazy,

1:01:40.109 --> 1:01:42.811
and if there's one thing I've
learned from my past marriages...

1:01:42.845 --> 1:01:45.414
Marriages? You didn't
tell me there were two.

1:01:45.447 --> 1:01:47.249
- Or more?
- One thing I've learned

1:01:47.283 --> 1:01:49.285
is I have to stop
trying to rescue women.

1:01:51.153 --> 1:01:54.156
So that's your conclusion
based on your snooping?

1:01:54.189 --> 1:01:57.226
You have a bottle of Oxy in
someone else's name, Adderall...

1:01:57.259 --> 1:01:59.161
You know, I don't appreciate
people going through my shit.

1:01:59.194 --> 1:02:00.496
Well then, if you
have nothing to hide...

1:02:00.529 --> 1:02:01.830
You know, you're
the biggest fucking

1:02:01.864 --> 1:02:03.198
control freak in the world.

1:02:03.232 --> 1:02:04.433
I'm done trying
to catch a falling knife.

1:02:04.466 --> 1:02:06.068
Well, I don't need rescuing.

1:02:06.101 --> 1:02:07.870
Good, because I'm not
a lifeguard anymore.

1:02:07.903 --> 1:02:09.471
No, you're just a fucking guy

1:02:09.505 --> 1:02:11.807
with a badge
and a stick up his ass.

1:02:14.877 --> 1:02:16.178
The door is
right over there, Ali.

1:02:17.580 --> 1:02:19.281
Don't forget your Oxy.

1:02:21.651 --> 1:02:23.218
I had a fucking neck injury.

1:02:27.990 --> 1:02:28.957
Fuck you.

1:02:29.958 --> 1:02:31.327
Mature.

1:03:28.050 --> 1:03:29.652
<i>In the last month,</i>

1:03:29.686 --> 1:03:32.020
we've had formal complaints
from Dylan and his parents

1:03:32.054 --> 1:03:35.592
and Lily and her parents about your
poor judgment, inappropriate behavior,

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:37.660
and unethical choices.

1:03:37.694 --> 1:03:41.096
Dylan, can you share with us
what Miss Silver said to you?

1:03:41.130 --> 1:03:43.031
She told me that
all the other students

1:03:43.065 --> 1:03:44.400
were calling anything small...

1:03:45.367 --> 1:03:46.703
a Dylan dick.

1:03:46.736 --> 1:03:48.437
They weren't, she was just

1:03:48.470 --> 1:03:49.972
trying to freak me out.

1:03:50.005 --> 1:03:51.173
Lily, would you mind telling us

1:03:51.206 --> 1:03:52.474
what made you feel uncomfortable

1:03:52.508 --> 1:03:53.942
about your sessions
with Miss Silver?

1:03:55.077 --> 1:03:56.178
She was just...

1:03:57.580 --> 1:03:59.148
I'm pretty sure she hates men.

1:03:59.181 --> 1:04:00.583
Lily, why are you doing this?

1:04:00.617 --> 1:04:02.918
We're the ones
asking the questions here.

1:04:03.653 --> 1:04:04.621
You two may go now.

1:04:05.789 --> 1:04:09.558
You have also been caught
on video sleeping seductively.

1:04:09.592 --> 1:04:11.293
Seductively?

1:04:11.326 --> 1:04:13.028
Are you joking?

1:04:13.061 --> 1:04:14.563
I, I don't know
who took that video,

1:04:14.597 --> 1:04:16.532
but, um, I felt violated.

1:04:16.565 --> 1:04:19.034
You also have admitted
on being on a medication

1:04:19.067 --> 1:04:21.370
without informing
the school nurse as required.

1:04:21.403 --> 1:04:23.572
And now, we have
a star athlete parent's

1:04:23.606 --> 1:04:25.541
- threatening to sue the school.
- Hmm.

1:04:26.442 --> 1:04:28.343
Due to
your erratic behavior,

1:04:28.377 --> 1:04:30.245
I'm asking that you take
a drug test immediately.

1:04:31.180 --> 1:04:34.183
And if you fail to do so,
I must ask for your resignation.

1:04:34.216 --> 1:04:36.218
And if you do not
want to comply with this,

1:04:36.251 --> 1:04:39.021
I will terminate your work here,
effective immediately.

1:04:43.726 --> 1:04:45.728
Well, I guess I was wrong.

1:04:48.665 --> 1:04:51.033
You did get to see another
woman get run over again.

1:05:16.124 --> 1:05:17.025
Stop it.

1:05:18.728 --> 1:05:19.762
Stop it!

1:05:25.133 --> 1:05:26.168
Fuck off!

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:45.688
Tell me, baby.

1:05:48.791 --> 1:05:50.760
I was fired.

1:05:50.793 --> 1:05:51.761
Oh.

1:05:53.128 --> 1:05:54.329
What can I do to help?

1:05:57.266 --> 1:05:58.668
Take me away.

1:05:58.701 --> 1:06:00.135
Far, far away.

1:06:02.639 --> 1:06:04.239
I thought you might say that.

1:06:06.809 --> 1:06:08.477
What am I, in kindergarten?

1:06:09.846 --> 1:06:11.079
Just wait.

1:06:22.859 --> 1:06:24.226
How do you feel?

1:06:27.630 --> 1:06:32.501
Like I'm swimming in a pool
of warm marshmallows.

1:06:35.304 --> 1:06:36.806
That's fent, all right.

1:06:39.809 --> 1:06:41.611
Close your eyes, my beauty.

1:07:11.674 --> 1:07:13.475
Have you ever kissed Veronica?

1:07:15.177 --> 1:07:17.212
I've never kissed any girl.

1:07:35.364 --> 1:07:37.265
Ali? Ali!

1:07:39.869 --> 1:07:41.671
<i>Wake up, wake up.</i>

1:07:43.873 --> 1:07:45.608
<i>Ali, wake up.</i>

1:07:50.445 --> 1:07:52.649
<i>Hi,
you've reached Eva Silver.</i>

1:07:52.682 --> 1:07:54.684
<i>Tip for the day:
write the bad things</i>

1:07:54.717 --> 1:07:56.518
<i>that happen to you in sand,</i>

1:07:56.551 --> 1:07:58.520
<i>carve the good things
that happen to you</i>

1:07:58.553 --> 1:08:00.355
<i>on a slab of marble,</i>

1:08:00.389 --> 1:08:03.291
<i>and leave a message at the beep.</i>

1:08:03.325 --> 1:08:06.461
<i>The mailbox is full and cannot accept</i>

1:08:06.495 --> 1:08:08.463
<i>any messages at this time.
Goodbye.</i>

1:08:11.701 --> 1:08:12.635
<i>Mommy.</i>

1:08:15.470 --> 1:08:17.506
<i>I must be such
a disappointment to you.</i>

1:08:18.741 --> 1:08:20.943
<i>This is not what
you'd want for me.</i>

1:08:26.783 --> 1:08:29.551
<i>I wish I could hear you tell me
that one day I'll get it right.</i>

1:08:33.455 --> 1:08:35.457
<i>That this is just
the end of what you taught me</i>

1:08:35.490 --> 1:08:37.827
<i>was an</i> annus horribilis,

1:08:37.860 --> 1:08:41.430
<i>a horrible year,
written in sand.</i>

1:09:09.892 --> 1:09:10.893
Love yourself.

1:09:42.491 --> 1:09:44.727
<i>It's like
this thing I was told,</i>

1:09:44.761 --> 1:09:47.462
it's in total blackness
that you can see the light.

1:09:47.496 --> 1:09:50.733
In the tank, images
and memories flow in and out,

1:09:50.767 --> 1:09:52.702
and it gave me
a safe place to process

1:09:52.735 --> 1:09:55.071
and to get honest with myself.

1:09:55.104 --> 1:09:57.405
Move through
the ridiculousness of it all.

1:09:57.439 --> 1:09:59.474
I didn't know what
you'd been going through.

1:09:59.508 --> 1:10:00.910
As in fired from my job,

1:10:00.943 --> 1:10:03.411
not living an authentic
grown-up life,

1:10:03.445 --> 1:10:06.816
my first and last ride
in the back of an ambulance.

1:10:07.717 --> 1:10:10.019
Wow, I'm glad you're safe.

1:10:10.052 --> 1:10:12.354
It was a real wake up call.

1:10:12.387 --> 1:10:14.791
I'm going to start back with
the foster parenting classes.

1:10:14.824 --> 1:10:16.424
Get back to what is important.

1:10:16.458 --> 1:10:18.060
So, you're cool
doing it on your own?

1:10:19.394 --> 1:10:21.363
Yeah, I am.

1:10:21.396 --> 1:10:23.699
But I can't be a foster parent
until I get a job,

1:10:23.733 --> 1:10:25.835
so it's a whole process.

1:10:27.502 --> 1:10:28.938
I may be able
to help you out with that.

1:10:30.740 --> 1:10:33.475
I know one of the board
of directors of Promises Rehab,

1:10:33.508 --> 1:10:35.011
right here in Malibu.

1:10:35.044 --> 1:10:36.879
They're looking
for another therapist.

1:10:38.047 --> 1:10:41.083
Past drug use isn't a detriment,
it's a requirement.

1:10:43.119 --> 1:10:44.854
That would be incredible.

1:10:45.755 --> 1:10:48.991
So, how is your girlfriend,
what did you say her name was?

1:10:49.025 --> 1:10:50.693
Carmen.

1:10:50.726 --> 1:10:54.597
- We're engaged.
- Oh, I forgot, you move fast.

1:10:55.631 --> 1:10:57.700
What did you say about, uh...

1:10:59.068 --> 1:11:01.369
I told Carmen
that I'm from Kansas,

1:11:01.403 --> 1:11:03.039
that I forage for my own food,

1:11:03.072 --> 1:11:05.641
and I like threesomes
with women like Jazmine.

1:11:05.675 --> 1:11:06.809
And?

1:11:06.843 --> 1:11:07.777
She said:

1:11:08.778 --> 1:11:11.681
"I've never met anybody
from Kansas before."

1:11:14.917 --> 1:11:15.852
Right?

1:11:17.987 --> 1:11:21.090
- It's good to see you.
- Um, it's good to see you.

1:11:21.123 --> 1:11:23.092
- I'm glad you're doing well.
- Thank you.

1:11:24.594 --> 1:11:25.895
Shit.

1:11:25.928 --> 1:11:27.797
It's supposed to be here
somewhere.

1:11:27.830 --> 1:11:29.431
How could I get a zit at my age?

1:11:29.464 --> 1:11:30.633
I'm supposed to be
worried about wrinkles

1:11:30.666 --> 1:11:32.467
and sun damage, not zits.

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:34.670
Can you relax?
You got this.

1:11:34.704 --> 1:11:37.173
That's what Nice Guy said,
I wouldn't win this interview without him.

1:11:37.206 --> 1:11:39.041
Nice Guy has really
been living up to his name.

1:11:39.075 --> 1:11:40.910
And I wouldn't
be here without you.

1:11:40.943 --> 1:11:43.145
The hospital visits,
the rest of it.

1:11:43.179 --> 1:11:45.081
I couldn't lose my best friend.

1:11:45.114 --> 1:11:46.849
Even if she was
being a dumb ass.

1:11:48.918 --> 1:11:50.186
Just put toothpaste on it.

1:11:50.219 --> 1:11:52.755
That is blue, I need a conceal.

1:11:52.788 --> 1:11:55.191
Ugh, there is
so much shit in here.

1:11:55.224 --> 1:11:58.828
- Dress or pants?
- Um, wear pants, uh, the purple sweater set

1:11:58.861 --> 1:12:01.797
with the gold and porcelain
buttons or whatever.

1:12:01.831 --> 1:12:03.799
Oh, what about
that pink turtleneck?

1:12:05.567 --> 1:12:08.403
Or maybe a red dress or something, you don't
want to show too much skin, never mind.

1:12:09.205 --> 1:12:10.773
- OxyContin?
- Really?

1:12:13.075 --> 1:12:14.110
Pot?

1:12:16.178 --> 1:12:17.445
Condoms.

1:12:19.715 --> 1:12:20.917
You're a superstar.

1:12:20.950 --> 1:12:22.919
Who am I kidding
about the condoms?

1:12:24.687 --> 1:12:26.756
You got <i>Foster Friday's</i> on?

1:12:26.789 --> 1:12:27.890
As always.

1:12:29.258 --> 1:12:31.160
Ah, I'm still fixing my face.

1:12:31.193 --> 1:12:33.495
I feel like I'm 13.

1:12:33.528 --> 1:12:36.498
Hey, yo, you remember
that kid from last year, Leo?

1:12:36.531 --> 1:12:38.134
The one who tripped
the cameraman and got

1:12:38.167 --> 1:12:39.669
paint all over
the anchor's hair and stuff?

1:12:40.803 --> 1:12:42.470
Yeah, we loved him.

1:12:42.504 --> 1:12:44.206
Not the hair!

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:45.608
Well, he is back.

1:12:46.709 --> 1:12:48.611
I thought he had
his forever home.

1:12:48.644 --> 1:12:50.246
Apparently not.

1:12:50.279 --> 1:12:53.582
It's going to be tough for him,
though, his being so old.

1:12:53.616 --> 1:12:55.483
He is special.

1:12:55.517 --> 1:12:58.587
Expressive eyes.
Wise old soul, right?

1:12:58.621 --> 1:13:00.488
Yeah, but he's
a handful, though.

1:13:01.590 --> 1:13:03.793
Remember last year I said it?

1:13:03.826 --> 1:13:05.161
I told you, I said this guy,

1:13:05.194 --> 1:13:07.562
this kid would be
a good match for me.

1:13:07.596 --> 1:13:08.731
But you couldn't commit.

1:13:10.967 --> 1:13:13.970
Hold on, are we
seriously talking about this?

1:13:23.846 --> 1:13:25.948
I'll imagine it
carved in marble.

1:13:27.216 --> 1:13:28.217
Are you okay, Mom?

1:13:29.385 --> 1:13:32.788
Yeah, it's just the first time
you've called me "mom."

1:13:32.822 --> 1:13:34.824
At first, I thought
you were stuck with me

1:13:34.857 --> 1:13:37.259
being the oldest one
at the foster home.

1:13:37.293 --> 1:13:40.562
Know this, you were
my first and only choice,

1:13:40.596 --> 1:13:43.299
so, now you're stuck with me.

1:14:32.681 --> 1:14:34.083
Welcome back to the 'bu.

1:14:34.116 --> 1:14:36.685
Sure we lost Ali,
one of our boldest soldiers,

1:14:36.719 --> 1:14:40.623
but don't worry, no fire,
mudslide, earthquake,

1:14:40.656 --> 1:14:43.292
or fallen soldier is going to
stop us from doing what we do.

1:14:43.325 --> 1:14:45.594
Mojito sipping,
night time surfing,

1:14:45.628 --> 1:14:47.029
living it up in paradise.
