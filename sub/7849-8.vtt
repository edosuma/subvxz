10:09.100 --> 10:11.467
THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
AND YOU'RE GOING TO FIX IT!

10:11.467 --> 10:14.367
WHO AM I KIDDING?
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT!

10:16.000 --> 10:17.734
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH SPENCER?

10:17.734 --> 10:20.500
HE LOOKS
A LITTLE LOW--
I MEAN, DOWN.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.133
SAD.

10:23.133 --> 10:26.033
TURNS OUT THAT
SPENCER IS BROKE.

10:26.033 --> 10:29.467
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE HIM A JOB
AT THE HOTEL?

10:29.467 --> 10:32.367
SPLENDID IDEA.
HOW ABOUT CANDY COUNTER
GIRL?

10:32.367 --> 10:35.967
HOW ABOUT WE NEVER
HAD THIS CONVERSATION?

10:35.967 --> 10:36.967
AHEM...AHEM.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.100
YES?

10:39.100 --> 10:40.667
ANY LUCK GETTING
THE LOAN FROM THE BANK,

10:40.667 --> 10:42.900
HE SAID HOPEFULLY.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.500
NO, HE ANSWERED SADLY.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.133
WAIT, LITTLE BRO MOSEBY.

10:50.133 --> 10:53.567
IRENE THE CONCIERGE
IS HOME WITH LARYNGITIS.

10:53.567 --> 10:55.834
MAYBE BIG BRO MOSEBY
CAN FILL IN FOR HER.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.967
ESTEBAN,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.800
SPENCER WOULD NEVER
TAKE THAT JOB.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.233
YES, SPENCER WOULD.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.233
BUT THAT JOB REQUIRES
A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE

11:04.233 --> 11:06.400
OF THE CITY
AND THE RESTAURANTS
AND ATTRACTIONS--

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
EXCUSE ME.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.300
I NEED RESERVATIONS
FOR 10 PEOPLE

11:09.300 --> 11:12.934
FOR 8:00 TONIGHT
AT LUIGI'S RESTAURANTE.

11:12.934 --> 11:15.867
OH, I'M SO SORRY,
BUT LUIGI'S RESTAURANTE
BOOKS UP--

11:15.867 --> 11:20.400
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

11:20.400 --> 11:21.500
IT'S ALL SET.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.500
OH...OH!

11:23.500 --> 11:25.400
OH, THANK YOU!

11:25.400 --> 11:27.300
WONDERFUL CONCIERGE.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.033
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE HIM.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.033
OK, SPENCER,
LET'S GO TALK ABOUT
YOUR NEW JOB.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.700
GREAT. I'M GOING TO NEED
A SIZABLE ADVANCE.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.400
OH, YOU WOULD.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.133
I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE
FOR THE TWO MR. MOSEBYS

11:42.133 --> 11:43.734
TO SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

11:43.734 --> 11:47.200
YOU ALSO THINK
THAT HAT MAKES YOU LOOK COOL.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.300
OH, SO YOU SEE IT,
TOO, HUH?

11:50.300 --> 11:51.800
SPEAKING OF LOOKING COOL,

11:51.800 --> 11:54.300
GUESS WHAT LONDON'S HOROSCOPE
TOLD HER WHAT TO WEAR TODAY.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.800
CAN I STILL GUESS
EVEN THOUGH I'M
LOOKING AT HER?

12:02.800 --> 12:04.233
NICE OUTFIT.

12:04.233 --> 12:07.767
DID A MAGICIAN JUST
PULL YOU OUT OF HIS HAT?

12:07.767 --> 12:09.967
NO. AND I KNOW
THIS LOOKS SILLY,

12:09.967 --> 12:11.934
BUT MY HOROSCOPE SAID
IF I DIDN'T WEAR THIS

12:11.934 --> 12:13.767
BAD THINGS WOULD HAPPEN.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.900
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT
TO TEMPT FATE.

12:16.900 --> 12:20.100
NOW HIPPITY-HOP OFF
DOWN THE BUNNY TRAIL.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.467
AND REMEMBER,
IF YOU NEED EXTRA LUCK,

12:23.467 --> 12:26.100
YOU CAN ALWAYS RUB
YOUR OWN FOOT.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.500
OH, PLEASE.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.200
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
LOOK SILLY.

12:34.700 --> 12:38.233
HEY...
WE DID A GOOD JOB.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.967
OH, I GET IT.
THE SILENT TREATMENT.

12:46.467 --> 12:49.300
OK, TWO CAN PLAY
AT THAT GAME.

12:51.667 --> 12:55.500
ALL RIGHT,
ONLY ONE CAN--
YOU WIN.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.500
WELL, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THE TIME?

13:00.500 --> 13:01.834
IT'S AFTER 2:00.

13:01.834 --> 13:03.300
MY TURN
TO RIDE OUR BIKE.

13:03.300 --> 13:08.400
DON'T...TOUCH...THAT...BIKE.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.200
OOH, IT SPEAKS.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.700
YEAH,
AND IT ANGRY!

13:14.700 --> 13:17.900
UH-UH-UH--
SCHEDULE RULES.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.700
HEY, FIXING TIME
IS A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN RIDING TIME,

13:22.700 --> 13:25.200
SO, TECHNICALLY,
IT'S MY TURN!

13:25.200 --> 13:27.567
TECHNICALLY, TOUGH.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.934
ONE MINUTE.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.300
EXCUSE ME, SPENCER,

13:34.300 --> 13:36.100
BUT THESE PEOPLE
NEED YOUR ATTENTION.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.100
NOT NOW, MARION.
I'M ON A BUSINESS CALL.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.934
RUNNING THE CONCIERGE DESK
IS YOUR BUSINESS.

13:40.934 --> 13:43.600
ARE YOU BELITTLING ME?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.900
NO, NO, NO--
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.400
WHAT I WAS SAYING WAS--

13:49.400 --> 13:50.600
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.100
NOW,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

13:52.100 --> 13:53.400
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO MY CALL.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.000
MY LITTLE BRO
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.200
WHICH ONE'S FIRST?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.600
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

13:59.600 --> 14:01.400
LONDON, HOW DID
THE BUNNY SUIT GO OVER
YESTERDAY?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.033
NOT SO WELL.

14:03.033 --> 14:04.567
PEOPLE LAUGHED AT ME.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.867
OHH...

14:06.867 --> 14:09.600
SO, LONDON,
ARE YOU GOING TO
THE FIREMEN'S BALL?

14:09.600 --> 14:12.233
I HEAR
IT'S THE HOTTEST PARTY
OF THE YEAR.

14:12.233 --> 14:15.967
'CAUSE IT'S HOT
WITH THE FIRE...

14:15.967 --> 14:18.200
I KNOW,
BUT MY HOROSCOPE SAYS

14:18.200 --> 14:20.300
THAT TODAY IS A BAD DAY
TO GO OUTSIDE.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.233
NO.

14:21.233 --> 14:22.800
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.100
AND I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BRING A GUEST.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.600
HEY, DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO GO?

14:28.567 --> 14:30.200
US?
US?

14:31.600 --> 14:34.200
WELL,
IF YOU INSIST.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.500
GREAT. THE LIMOUSINE
WILL PICK YOU UP AT 7:00.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
OHH!

14:38.500 --> 14:40.233
YEAH!

14:41.200 --> 14:43.400
AND THEN HE JUST
TOOK THE BIKE.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.133
IT'S SO NOT FAIR.

14:45.133 --> 14:46.667
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO HIM?

14:46.667 --> 14:49.600
NO, I WAS GIVING HIM
THE SILENT TREATMENT.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.133
HOW'D THAT
WORK OUT FOR YOU?

14:51.133 --> 14:54.133
MY POINT IS,
ZACK IS HOGGING THE BIKE,

14:54.133 --> 14:57.800
AND HE'S CLEVERLY
USING MY SCHEDULE
AGAINST ME.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.600
SHARING IS TOUGH.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.000
WHEN I WAS A KID
I TRIED SHARING A BOYFRIEND
WITH NIKKI MALDONADO.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.400
IT WAS A DISASTER.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.667
SHE GOT THE GUY?

15:06.667 --> 15:10.133
NO, I DID.
AND THEN HE ATE
ALL MY ANIMAL CRACKERS.

15:10.133 --> 15:12.800
OH, YOU WERE
IN KINDERGARTEN.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.200
NO, HIGH SCHOOL.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.100
GOT A MESSAGE
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.300
THE MICROPHONE STAND
IS BROKEN...AGAIN.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.567
MOM, I'VE GOT
BROTHER PROBLEMS
HERE.

15:21.567 --> 15:23.767
PLEASE, DO NOT
TALK TO ME ABOUT BROTHERS.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.600
SPENCER IS GIVING ME
SUCH A MIGRAINE.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.567
ZACK IS SELFISH.

15:26.567 --> 15:27.600
SPENCER'S A BULLY.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.000
HE DOESN'T LISTEN.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.400
HE HAS
NO CONSIDERATION FOR ME.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.500
AND HE STINKS.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.000
PERSONALITY-WISE,
AND FRANKLY,
HIS BODY ODOR.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.500
[BOTH ARGUING]

15:36.500 --> 15:39.767
STOP! SIT.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.033
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY
BEING A YOUNGER SIBLING.

15:42.033 --> 15:44.100
I REMEMBER TORTURING
MY YOUNGER SISTER.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.600
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A YOUNGER SISTER.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.800
SHE DOESN'T
TALK TO ME ANYMORE.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.467
MY POINT IS,
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SOLVE ANYTHING

15:50.467 --> 15:51.667
BY COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.000
YOU GOT TO STAND UP
TO YOUR BIG BROTHER.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
BUT, MOM--

15:54.000 --> 15:55.700
THIS IS ONE BATTLE
I CAN'T FIGHT FOR YOU.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.500
AND MOSEBY,
YOU AND SPENCER SHOULD HAVE
HAD THIS BATTLE

15:57.500 --> 15:59.100
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.100
I'M GOING TO DO
THE MATURE THING

16:03.100 --> 16:04.400
AND GO CALL MY SISTER.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.600
WITH ANY LUCK,
SHE'S STILL AT WORK

16:06.600 --> 16:08.834
AND I CAN LEAVE
A MESSAGE.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.200
YOU KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.867
WHY ARE WE SO INTIMIDATED
BY OUR BROTHERS?

16:14.867 --> 16:16.767
WELL,
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,

16:16.767 --> 16:19.033
ZACK ONCE NOOGIED ME
SO HARD

16:19.033 --> 16:21.900
I LOST 5 I.Q. POINTS.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.133
SPENCER MAY BE SHORT,

16:24.133 --> 16:25.767
BUY HE POUNCES
LIKE A CAT.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.867
PLUS, HE BITES.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.967
OK, WE'RE PATHETIC.

16:30.934 --> 16:32.367
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.734
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.200
I'M GOING
TO MARCH RIGHT UPSTAIRS

16:37.200 --> 16:38.400
AND STAND UP TO SPENCER.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.200
AND I'LL GIVE ZACK
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.700
YOU FIRST.
YOU FIRST.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.600
I APPRECIATE THE CALL.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.300
SPENCER, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU IMMEDIATELY.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.400
OK, BUT BEFORE YOU DO,

16:59.400 --> 17:00.567
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.900
NO, YOU ARE GOING
TO LISTEN TO ME
FOR ONCE.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.100
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER
TREATED ME

17:06.100 --> 17:07.500
WITH RESPECT
AS YOUR BROTHER,

17:07.500 --> 17:09.300
BUT NOW
YOU'RE MY EMPLOYEE

17:09.300 --> 17:11.033
AND YOU'RE STILL
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF ME.

17:11.033 --> 17:12.900
SO, I'M CONSISTENT.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.100
YOU'RE CONSISTENTLY
A JERK!

17:15.100 --> 17:17.500
OH, NOT YOU, SIR.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.767
YOU'RE CONSISTENTLY
A JERK!

17:20.767 --> 17:22.400
I--

17:22.400 --> 17:23.867
NO, NO--
NONE OF YOUR BACKTALK!

17:23.867 --> 17:26.200
FROM NOW ON,
YOU WILL SPEAK TO ME
WITH RESPECT

17:26.200 --> 17:29.667
OR WE WON'T SPEAK
AT ALL.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.500
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
AND ANOTHER THING!

17:32.500 --> 17:34.800
I--SAY WHAT?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.867
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I HAVE MISTREATED YOU.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.967
ESPECIALLY NOW,
BECAUSE YOU HELPED ME

17:39.967 --> 17:41.300
WHEN I REALLY NEEDED IT.

17:41.300 --> 17:44.500
WELL, AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE MY BIG BROTHER,
AND...

17:46.300 --> 17:49.033
I LOVE YOU.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.500
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MARION.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.567
SEE YA.

17:52.567 --> 17:53.567
WHAT? WHOA!

17:53.567 --> 17:55.567
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.033
THAT PHONE CALL
YOU INTERRUPTED

17:57.033 --> 17:58.934
WAS MY BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.

17:58.934 --> 18:00.400
HE CAME THROUGH
WITH MY FUNDING.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.233
I'M GOING TO BE RICH AGAIN!

18:02.233 --> 18:05.033
A FEELING
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW!

18:05.033 --> 18:07.567
THAT WAS ALMOST
A NICE MOMENT.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.834
OH, AND SINCE
I'M APOLOGIZING,

18:09.834 --> 18:13.600
I'M SORRY I SHAVED
"DORK" IN YOUR HAIR
WHEN YOU WERE 5.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.867
YOU SAID THAT
WAS THE HAIR GREMLIN.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.600
I LIED.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.500
WHAT?

18:22.200 --> 18:27.000
PEOPLE CALLED ME
"DORK HAIR" FOR YEARS!

18:27.000 --> 18:29.967
INCLUDING MOM.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.367
DON'T BE MAD JUST BECAUSE
MOM LIKED ME BEST.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.233
SHE DID NOT.

18:34.233 --> 18:36.233
YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY
SHE TREATED YOU BETTER.

18:36.233 --> 18:37.300
DON'T GO THERE.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.734
DON'T GO THERE.
OH, YEAH.

18:38.734 --> 18:43.133
BECAUSE YOU WERE
LACTOSE INTOLERANT!

18:43.133 --> 18:46.767
OOOH, YOU WENT THERE!

18:46.767 --> 18:48.000
HA HA HA HA!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.667
♪ WHO'S AFRAID OF CHEESE,
WHO'S AFRAID OF CHEESE? ♪

18:50.667 --> 18:52.200
OW!

18:52.200 --> 18:54.734
THAT'S IT!
I GOT YOU!

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
OH, NO, NO, NO!

18:59.000 --> 19:00.567
HE KICKED ME FIRST.

19:00.567 --> 19:01.567
HE STARTED IT!

19:01.567 --> 19:02.600
OW! SEE?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.800
I'M GOING TO GET YOU!

19:08.600 --> 19:12.000
OH, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT,
LITTLE ONE?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.600
HUH?
CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR--

19:13.600 --> 19:15.133
AAH!

19:16.600 --> 19:18.033
OH, THAT HURTS!

19:18.033 --> 19:20.000
SPENCER, PLEASE,
THIS IS A LOBBY,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.133
NOT A WRESTLING MAT!

19:22.667 --> 19:23.934
THERE YOU ARE.

19:23.934 --> 19:25.400
I NEED
TO SPEAK TO YOU.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.700
CAN YOU MAKE IT QUICK?

19:26.700 --> 19:28.400
YOU'RE CUTTING INTO
MY BIKE TIME.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.100
EXACTLY. HOW COME
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY TIME
WITH OUR BIKE?

19:32.100 --> 19:33.133
I PAID
FOR MOST OF IT.

19:33.133 --> 19:34.133
NOW GET OFF!

19:34.133 --> 19:35.667
OK, FINE.

19:35.667 --> 19:36.900
IF YOU WANT
TO BREAK OUR DEAL

19:36.900 --> 19:38.400
AND FORGET ABOUT
YOUR SCHEDULE,

19:38.400 --> 19:39.834
GO AHEAD,
TAKE THE BIKE.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.500
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.700
OH, GREAT.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.900
IT'S ABOUT ME
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK

19:46.900 --> 19:48.200
AND CLEANING OUR ROOM

19:48.200 --> 19:49.500
AND EATING
YOUR BROCCOLI FOR YOU

19:49.500 --> 19:50.834
WHEN MOM'S NOT LOOKING.

19:50.834 --> 19:53.000
YOU OFFERED
TO DO ALL THAT STUFF.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
BROTHERS DO FOR EACH OTHER.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.367
BUT IT'S NEVER RECIPROCAL.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.734
WHAT?

19:59.734 --> 20:02.500
RECIPROCAL MEANS
IT WOULD BE NICE

20:02.500 --> 20:05.133
IF ONCE IN AWHILE
YOU DID SOMETHING FOR ME.

20:05.133 --> 20:09.033
I DID.
YOU OFFERED ME MONEY
AND I TOOK IT.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.600
HA HA! VERY FUNNY.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.400
WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

20:14.400 --> 20:15.800
IT'S NOT ALL OF A SUDDEN.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.200
IT'S BEEN 13 YEARS
IN THE MAKING.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.667
AND I DON'T WANT US
TO END UP LIKE

20:19.667 --> 20:21.567
MR. MOSEBY
AND HIS BROTHER.

20:21.567 --> 20:24.834
[YELLING AND STRUGGLING]

20:26.700 --> 20:28.600
IF WE DO,
CAN I BE SPENCER?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.200
HE'S RICH,
HE GETS ALL THE BABES,

20:30.200 --> 20:32.233
AND HE'S WINNING.

20:32.233 --> 20:33.667
GET OFF MY BACK!

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
[CHOMP]

20:37.000 --> 20:39.867
AAH! MY FOOT! OW!

20:42.133 --> 20:44.133
THIS IS WHAT I MEAN.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.300
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP
EVERYTHING BOTTLED UP INSIDE

20:46.300 --> 20:47.500
FOR 30 YEARS,

20:47.500 --> 20:48.967
THEN WIND UP HATING YOU.

20:48.967 --> 20:50.500
YOU'D HATE ME?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
EVENTUALLY.

20:56.300 --> 20:59.033
LIKE NOW,
IF I DON'T GET THIS BIKE.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.767
IT'S YOURS.

21:00.767 --> 21:01.967
GOOD,
AND FROM NOW ON,

21:01.967 --> 21:04.300
I EXPECT YOU
TO THINK OF ME
AS YOUR EQUAL.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.467
EXCEPT IN SCHOOL,
WHERE I'M CLEARLY BETTER.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.400
CAN YOU DO THAT?

21:08.400 --> 21:10.233
FOR YOU, OF COURSE.

21:10.233 --> 21:14.867
LET'S HUG IT OUT,
YOU OVERLY-SENSITIVE LUG.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.233
SORRY, MAN, HOT BABE.

21:21.233 --> 21:24.934
THANKS FOR
POINTING HER OUT.

21:25.834 --> 21:26.967
HEY, BABE,

21:26.967 --> 21:29.600
WANT TO RIDE
ON MY HANDLEBARS?

21:31.367 --> 21:34.934
HE'S SO IN
OVER HIS HEAD.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GET TO GO
TO THE FIREMEN'S BALL

21:41.000 --> 21:42.400
AND RIDE IN A LIMO.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.800
IN MY COUNTRY,
A LIMO IS A CART
PULLED BY LLAMA.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.400
IT'S CALLED A "LLAMO."

21:48.300 --> 21:50.600
I WONDER WHERE IT IS.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.000
RIGHT HERE.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:53.400 --> 21:56.500
I'M DRESSED AS A FIREMAN,
AND I'M HAVING A BALL.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.967
AAH! AAH!

22:01.300 --> 22:03.200
YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE
READ YOUR HOROSCOPE.

22:03.200 --> 22:05.600
MESS WITH A FRIEND,
AND YOU'LL BE COVERED
IN FOAM.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.800
THAT HOROSCOPE
WAS BIZARRELY ACCURATE.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.767
HOW'D YOU CATCH ON?

22:10.767 --> 22:13.734
IT WAS EASY.
I USED LOGIC, CUNNING,

22:13.734 --> 22:16.400
AND I OVERHEARD
YOU AND ESTEBAN
LAUGHING ABOUT IT.

22:16.400 --> 22:19.967
SO, CAN WE STILL
RIDE IN THE LIMO?
