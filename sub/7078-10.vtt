WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.711
Something for the committee
to put on the radar: Insurance.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.881
- What about it?
- School needs some.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.591
- I can ask on the street.
- What?

00:07.883 --> 00:10.427
Oh, too cool for street insurance?
Must be nice.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.722
My sister wants to know what I'm
bringing to my grandson's birthday.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.808
I'm sensing an emergency
collage situation.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.478
I wasn't invited.
My son had a kid three years ago.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.147
I barely get to see him
on major holidays.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.983
I mean,
who in the hell does he think he is?

00:25.275 --> 00:28.737
- You saw your son at his wedding.
- No, that's Furio, my gay son. Him, I get.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.240
Hank's a knob,
doesn't have any hobbies, interests.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.410
All he does is play... What do you call
that crap with dungeons and dragons?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.663
- "Dungeons and Dragons"?
- That's the crap.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.165
- I know that game.
- We play "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:40.457 --> 00:45.003
Guys, let's play "D&D"
to help Hickey reconnect with his son.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.966
Was everyone's takeaway last time that
we use "D&D" to reprogram brains?

00:49.258 --> 00:50.698
Not that we almost caused a suicide?

00:50.926 --> 00:55.013
We prevented one.
Fa... bulous Neil felt like a nobody.

00:55.305 --> 00:59.142
And thanks to us, he's still out there,
doing this and that in the background.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.727
Satisfying sequel's difficult.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.188
Many geniuses defeated themselves
through hubris.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.607
Making this a chance to prove
I'm better. I'm in!

01:05.899 --> 01:08.360
All in favour of a game
of "Dungeons and Dragons"...

01:08.652 --> 01:10.946
to reunite Hickey
and his son tomorrow night?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.489
Aye!

01:12.781 --> 01:17.869
Well, okay. It's short notice,
but I think it'll be good for me.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:29.798 --> 01:30.841
So, Dad...

01:31.133 --> 01:32.384
I'm just curious.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.469
What is it
about "Dungeons and Dragons"...

01:34.761 --> 01:37.347
that suddenly leapt out at you
at age 60?

01:38.974 --> 01:40.976
Dungeons. It'd be the dungeons.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.268
Let's begin.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.897
A blood orange sunrise crests
the peaks of Rage Mountain...

01:46.189 --> 01:48.233
as you arrive
at the troubled Galindor.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.235
Ahead to the north, a bridged ravine.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.488
Beyond that, a mysterious black tower
where, rumour has it...

01:53.780 --> 01:55.949
an evil necromancer dwells.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.827
Your goal: Reach the top
and destroy the necromancer...

01:59.119 --> 02:01.872
freeing the realm from his evil magic.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.583
Oh, that's just what I love
about role-playing games...

02:04.875 --> 02:07.419
is being told exactly what to do.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.588
- Me too.
- You should introduce yourselves.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.922
I am...

02:11.214 --> 02:14.509
Oh, boy. Joseph Gordon Diehard.
Really?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.219
Son of Sir Riggs Diehard.

02:16.511 --> 02:20.265
Well, I'm Sir Riggs Diehard, so I guess
I'm your dad in the game too.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.060
- Oh, my God, so cool.
- Isn't that weird?

02:23.352 --> 02:25.270
Oh, boy. Guys, I don't suppose...

02:25.562 --> 02:28.106
this is some contrived
paint-by-numbers adventure...

02:28.398 --> 02:30.567
that's designed to force
an emotional bond...

02:30.859 --> 02:34.154
between me and my emotionally
stunted father, is it?

02:34.446 --> 02:37.366
- No way, Jose.
- What?

02:37.658 --> 02:41.036
I got an idea. Why don't we just
sort of reshuffle all these...

02:41.328 --> 02:43.622
redistribute them.
Yeah, just mix them up a bit.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.123
I don't think...

02:45.415 --> 02:46.583
And here we go.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.253
Hello, everyone.
I am Tristram Steelheart.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.215
I'm a holy cleric with a mace
and a dumb name.

02:54.841 --> 02:59.554
I'm Tiny Nuggins, a thief,
and the rest is gibberish.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.100
Greetings, I am Fibrosis the Ranger.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.144
I'm Crouton, the half-orc Druid.
Druid?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.562
Oh, Crouton.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.648
Hector the Well-Endowed? Again?

03:09.940 --> 03:13.568
You think that's a weird coincidence?
I'm a troll named Dingleberry.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.612
That's my mom's nickname for me.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.698
I'm who Hickey was,
Sir Riggs Diehard.

03:17.989 --> 03:23.620
I am Joseph Gordon, son of Riggs.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.747
"I protect the blade of Diehard..."

03:26.039 --> 03:28.875
a family sword whose power
knows no equal.

03:29.167 --> 03:33.255
In our clan, the leader carries the hilt,
his eldest heir, the blade...

03:33.547 --> 03:36.550
for we believe
man's greatest weapon against evil...

03:36.842 --> 03:38.468
is the bond...

03:39.386 --> 03:41.847
"Is the bond between father and son."

03:44.391 --> 03:45.851
What would you guys like to do?

03:46.143 --> 03:49.646
We should cross the bridge
and head for the black tower. Huzzah?

03:49.938 --> 03:51.314
- Huzzah?
- Huzzah.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.859
I don't know if I'm gonna head
across the bridge.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.695
What else is out there?
What's south or east or west?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.363
How about it, Aziz?

03:58.655 --> 04:01.199
I walk too far south,
do I fall off your graph paper there?

04:01.491 --> 04:02.491
You can head south.

04:02.743 --> 04:05.370
I've generated some details
about the surrounding area.

04:05.662 --> 04:09.082
You know, for God's sakes, Hank,
it's been five seconds.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.626
- Can you not do this?
- Hey, you tell me.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.211
Are we losing?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.882
No. It's not a competition.
The only winner is fun.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.966
We're having fun.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.679
I go to Tristram, and I'm laughing...

04:22.971 --> 04:27.058
and I pick him up,
and I carry him to the bridge. It's fun.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.727
Hector is trying to lift you.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.229
I cast "Torvin's Flesh of Fire."

04:33.982 --> 04:35.817
Tristram murmurs an incantation.

04:36.109 --> 04:40.697
His body becomes wreathed in white
hot flame, burning Hector for...

04:40.989 --> 04:41.989
Six damage.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.576
- Hey!
- Hector, that's called self-defence.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.370
Tristram's spell
has caught the bridge on fire.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.706
The ropes snap
causing the bridge to twist.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.417
I'm rolling dexterity checks
to see if you all hold on.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.003
Abed, considering the bigger picture...

04:55.295 --> 04:59.716
you think it might be possible you
miscalculated the bridge strength?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.344
Would've been constructed
in the third age by goblins.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.179
They used primitive iron anchors.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.724
Ropes are yanked on both sides and
you all plummet into the ravine below.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.226
- Abed!
- Oh, no.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.186
- What?
- Abed!

05:11.478 --> 05:14.105
You plunge into the icy,
raging waters of Skull River.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.608
- What?
- You know, what's your problem?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.193
- What?
- You didn't invite me...

05:18.485 --> 05:20.278
- to Sebastian's birthday.
- I knew it!

05:20.570 --> 05:21.905
Who hoards a man's grandson?

05:22.197 --> 05:24.157
He's not your grandson. He's my son.

05:24.449 --> 05:28.453
And I didn't invite you to the birthday
party because I wanted to enjoy it.

05:30.247 --> 05:34.417
You know, fathers and sons,
there is a lot of power between them.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.253
- Yes.
- Stop it.

05:36.545 --> 05:40.298
And I spent a long time
letting that power...

05:40.590 --> 05:43.468
push me away from my dad,
and I regret it.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.262
So, what's ever between you guys...

05:45.554 --> 05:47.556
will only get fixed
when you're together.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.974
They're not together.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.309
- Not helping!
- Be a bad Dungeon Master if I was.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.771
Jeff, Hickey, Annie, Shirley,
washed down the left fork of the river...

05:55.063 --> 05:56.147
others to the right.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.149
Father!

05:58.441 --> 06:01.152
If you're gonna continue,
Hank, Britta, Chang, Dean Pelton...

06:01.444 --> 06:04.030
- go into a different room.
- We're not going to continue.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.658
Thank you very much, guys.
This was just awesome.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.327
Yeah, wait, wait.
I'll play your dragon game with you.

06:09.619 --> 06:13.832
But let's make it interesting.
If I kill the necrophile before you do...

06:14.124 --> 06:17.294
I come to my grandson's birthday.
We'll settle it like men.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.754
Or whatever you call the guys
that play this.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.756
Okay.

06:22.048 --> 06:27.679
But if I kill the necromancer
before you do...

06:27.971 --> 06:31.099
then you don't go to Christmas
or Thanksgiving at Aunt Rachel's.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.851
You don't even go to that.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.686
Yeah, but I will if you don't.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.023
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.524
Let the real game begin.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.703
I will find you!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.876
Well, I'm assuming
you guys can help me beat him...

06:58.168 --> 07:01.046
because if we lose, I'm gonna punch
each of you in the heart.

07:06.051 --> 07:09.387
You awaken on a riverbank, surrounded
by treacherous, godforsaken...

07:09.679 --> 07:11.014
non-zip line vacation jungle.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.142
I build a fire
and construct a crude wooden rack...

07:14.434 --> 07:16.353
to dry my boots
and oversized codpiece.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.732
And I can make some s'mores out of
horse meat and s'more horse meat.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.068
Build a fire? Horse s'mores?
Screw this.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.655
- The river runs east. I head west.
- Tiny Nuggins scampers into the jungle.

07:26.947 --> 07:31.534
Hey, I didn't scamper in the jungles
of Nicaragua and I won't do it now.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.620
- Wait, come back. I follow him.
- Me too.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.498
Tiny Nuggins, if we rest,
we'll regain our strength.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.832
And lose my family.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.002
I'll imaginary sleep
when I'm imaginary dead.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.672
In the distance,
you notice a patrol of hobgoblins.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.591
- Hobgoblins?
- Larger, stronger, and worth more...

07:46.883 --> 07:49.219
- in Scrabble than regular goblins.
- Get down.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.222
I punch him in the heart
and I keep running.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.849
There are no women with them,
are there? I got class.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.977
You charge,
alerting them to your presence.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.020
You attack the nearest one
in the chest.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.772
- You miss and fall down.
- What?

08:01.064 --> 08:03.233
Hobgoblins are heading toward
Nuggins with spears.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.277
Oh, no. I cast "Entangle" on them.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.154
Crouton the Druid waves her arms...

08:08.446 --> 08:12.575
causing grass, vines and branches
to entangle the limbs of...

08:13.535 --> 08:14.619
Four hobgoblins.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.123
The two free hobgoblins fire arrows
at Crouton.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.791
One pierces her shoulder.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.376
The other her chest.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.211
I fire an arrow at them.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.422
Hit.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.300
Hobgoblins don't like their odds.
They bolt into the jungle.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.760
Yeah, you better run.

08:31.052 --> 08:35.390
Go find a name that's not just
another creature's name plus "hob."

08:37.892 --> 08:40.145
- Crouton?
- I'm here.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.398
She was badly wounded
from her fall in the Skull River...

08:43.690 --> 08:46.276
and the arrows were just too much.
I'm sorry.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.945
That's it? Is she dead?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.655
Yes, that's it, Hickey.

08:50.947 --> 08:51.948
I'm dead.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.491
But it's okay.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.035
I'm on your side.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.078
Which is why I'm dead.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.455
And I may be gone...

08:58.747 --> 09:01.958
but just remember whenever
the wind whispers through the woods...

09:02.459 --> 09:04.502
you got me killed.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.509
Now, you listen to me, young man.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.179
I've punched about a thousand hearts
in my life.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.141
- I never, never missed.
- You ever been a 3-foot tall halfiing...

09:18.433 --> 09:21.978
running through 2-foot high vines
trying to punch a 7-foot monster?

09:22.604 --> 09:24.814
I'm gonna check the others.
Check your character.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.026
Or just kind of generally take this game
seriously. Your son does.

09:29.778 --> 09:34.282
I take a moment of silence
to mourn my fallen comrade, Crouton...

09:34.574 --> 09:37.535
before rifling through her belongings.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.999
- My father?
- No way to know where the others are.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.752
You're still travelling north
along narrow cliff edges...

09:46.044 --> 09:48.296
of Hawthorne Mountains.
I'll roll for encounters.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.007
I'd like to cast a healing spell
on Fibrosis.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.051
Thank you.

09:53.343 --> 09:56.221
But I'm not gonna help you
kick your dad out of your life.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.389
I don't think
this competition is healthy.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.809
I don't think what you did back there
was cool.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.729
You think I'm the bad guy because
I didn't invite him to my son's birthday.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.397
But you know where he was...

10:06.689 --> 10:08.399
for most of my birthdays?

10:08.691 --> 10:11.528
Little place that rhymes
with "not there."

10:11.820 --> 10:13.530
Times Square?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.282
You hear an ominous screeching.

10:16.574 --> 10:21.371
Moving upward into view, three huge,
white arachnids with eagle wings.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.705
Sky Spiders.

10:23.998 --> 10:28.253
I draw my sword, and I cry out,
"Back, eight-legged demons!

10:28.545 --> 10:32.590
I will not scoop you up with a catalogue
and let you outside on this day!"

10:32.882 --> 10:35.093
Stay your blade, Joseph Gordon.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.346
Sky Spiders are as frightened of us
as we are of them.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.265
Plus, they eat all the sky mosquitoes.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.768
I cast "Speak with Monsters,"
and I say:

10:44.727 --> 10:47.689
"Hello. You're looking well."

10:49.065 --> 10:52.193
The lead spider bends four knees
and twitches its hairy ovipositor...

10:52.485 --> 10:55.446
rhythmically secreting
and retracting a giant droplet...

10:55.738 --> 10:57.115
Or drop... of silk.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.783
Fibrosis, as a ranger...

10:59.075 --> 11:01.619
you recognise this as the arachnid
signal of submission.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.538
Nice work, Tristram.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.083
Damn, you made that Sky Spider
your bitch, yo!

11:10.295 --> 11:12.213
You've tracked the hobgoblins
to this shack.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.632
One guard hob-guards.
What they call guarding.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.384
- Go.
- Sniper arrow on the guard.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.802
Strikes true. Guard drops.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.930
- I move to the doorway, detect traps.
- None detected.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.307
- I enter.
- Left flank.

11:22.599 --> 11:23.808
- Right!
- One, facing east.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.310
- Backstab.
- Double damage.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.979
He's dead.
Footsteps behind the door to the north.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.397
I notch two arrows.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.775
- Climb the walls, get above the door.
- Goblins enter from the north.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.235
- I fire.
- Both arrows hit.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.321
- Cleave!
- You kill one and wound another.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.281
I drop on the last one and grapple.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.700
- You got a hold of him.
- This one is for Crouton.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.410
With his dying breath, he utters:

11:42.702 --> 11:46.581
"The dark lord will kill you all."

11:46.873 --> 11:48.374
Wait, these things can talk?

11:48.666 --> 11:50.043
I want two taken alive.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.419
I wanna try something.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.921
Hi.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.298
I'm Tiny Nuggins.

11:55.590 --> 11:59.469
I'm gonna put my dagger down
right here, so we can just talk.

11:59.761 --> 12:00.762
Human trash.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.431
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.058
We're looking for a necromancer.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.143
We don't need two goblins to find him.

12:07.435 --> 12:11.356
So between you and your friend,
who do you think's the most useful?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.359
Man, your friend sure can talk.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.194
Liar. He'll never turn.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.738
Oh, yeah,
because of that famous goblin loyalty.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.242
I could never drive a wedge
between you and some guy from work.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.787
I was best man at that guy's wedding.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.206
Your friend says you just got married.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.541
Congratulations.
Too bad about the food.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.294
I hope your flesh rots in... Wait.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.629
What about the food?

12:34.921 --> 12:37.090
Oh, I guess he didn't like
your wedding toast.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.633
Golbak said that?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.177
Klang doesn't approve of you and Lisa,
Golbak...

12:41.469 --> 12:45.515
and I don't get the sense
it's because of his feelings for you.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.602
I think about Lisa, sitting in that hole
in Darktooth Canyon...

12:49.894 --> 12:54.232
with that little Frimrok and Grignog
rolling about on the wolf pelts.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.360
Come on, between you and me,
which one do you think is yours?

12:57.652 --> 12:59.696
No!

13:02.740 --> 13:05.076
I know where the tower is.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.515
Sky Spiders have flown you
as far as their complex religion allows.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.518
They set you down and express,
through intricate prancing...

13:30.810 --> 13:32.937
- directions to the tower.
- Yes.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.774
Father, forgive me.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.152
I have travelled so far from you.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.613
How many game days
since the Skull River ripped us apart?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.616
How many real hours
since I've gone pee?

13:45.908 --> 13:47.118
We seek this necromancer.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.871
Why? Why?

13:50.163 --> 13:53.499
Our reasons are dreams,
our dreams, dust.

13:53.875 --> 13:57.337
I send word on wings of sparrows...

13:58.171 --> 14:00.798
in hopes they might find you.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.635
Abed says the odds
are near impossible.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.138
That's enough for me.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.977
Should you receive this message,
I know of a way to reunite.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.771
According to my character sheet...

14:15.063 --> 14:18.316
if I rub the blade of our magic
family sword while you rub the hilt...

14:18.608 --> 14:22.236
twin beacons of light
will reveal our locations to each other.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.573
Each night,
I will think of you and rub...

14:25.948 --> 14:30.578
praying for the night
fate will find us rubbing together.

14:30.870 --> 14:35.750
Your son, Joseph Gordon Diehard.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.008
Something strange has happened.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.761
A sparrow lands
on Riggs Diehard's shoulder.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.304
It carries a note.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.566
"Abed, I rub my sword's hilt"?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.819
Beam of light shoots up
from your location...

15:03.111 --> 15:04.862
as the hilt of Diehard
seeks its blade.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.574
The beam arcs and meets an equal
beam in the woods to the north.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.118
Is that where the others are?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.453
Yes, 10 miles away, same as you.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.539
So we'll be arriving at the tower...

15:14.831 --> 15:16.374
At the same time tomorrow morning.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.209
This began as a race.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.837
But it may end in war.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.630
Does anybody have a toothpick?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.174
I got a piece of popcorn
stuck in my tooth.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.386
Like, right under the gum.
I've been trying like for 15 minutes...

15:28.678 --> 15:31.889
with, you know, my tooth
and then with my tongue and my finger.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.642
I'm always one tooth off,
and I just can't seem to...

15:34.934 --> 15:37.103
Oh, hello, there we go. Anyway...

15:37.395 --> 15:40.022
But it may end in war.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.325
Maybe after all we've been through...

15:51.617 --> 15:53.703
we should just call this thing off.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.746
What, you think that's up to us?

15:56.038 --> 15:59.417
You've seen the way he talks to me,
doesn't want his father in his life.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.420
He'll do anything to win,
and that includes attacking you.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.339
And you best believe
that your little friends in there...

16:05.631 --> 16:07.091
are drinking up his Kool-Aid.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.511
This is a man who thinks
of grandchildren like trophies.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.224
Which is why he'll play to win.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.268
And why I can't let him.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.693
Rise, brave, sweet Dingleberry.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.403
Rise.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.114
Both parties have arrived
at the black tower.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.325
Hi, guys.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.536
- Father.
- Joseph Gordon.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.000
We are here so Tristram Steelheart,
Lord of the Sky Spiders...

16:41.292 --> 16:44.420
can slay the necromancer. You cool
or are we gonna have to get red?

16:44.712 --> 16:47.798
Tiny Nuggins, Waterboarder of Goblins,
will do the slaying...

16:48.090 --> 16:51.260
because every man has the right
to hang out with his grandson.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.720
Too bad you're outnumbered.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.388
No, they're not.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.599
I'm not part of this.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.518
I am Joseph Gordon Diehard...

16:58.809 --> 17:01.729
and I am only here to hug my father,
which I now do.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.021
It's a trick!

17:03.272 --> 17:05.566
- I'm not letting him hug me.
- I hug my father!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.486
- He has gunpowder in his pants.
- I draw my sword. Stay back!

17:08.778 --> 17:10.154
- I draw an arrow.
- So do I!

17:10.445 --> 17:11.821
Troll sound!

17:12.114 --> 17:13.156
- Lower your sword?
- No!

17:13.449 --> 17:15.826
- Dean, are you...?
- I hug my father!

17:16.117 --> 17:17.578
You're impaled.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.135
Worth it.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.679
Good Lord.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.097
Son slayer!

17:36.389 --> 17:37.848
- I attack Jeff!
- Arrow at Chang!

17:38.140 --> 17:40.184
- Arrow at Annie!
- I head for the door.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.978
So do I!

17:42.270 --> 17:43.854
- Taste the blade of Diehard!
- I run!

17:44.146 --> 17:45.773
- Turn a snake into a rope!
- Two arrows!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.817
- Spear, spear!
- I take the kid, pop him.

17:48.109 --> 17:51.153
- Three damage.
- Lightning bolt, lightning bolt!

17:51.445 --> 17:53.531
Heal our moderate wounds!

17:53.823 --> 17:57.618
- I spray all over them.
- I hold Britta's face in a puddle.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.704
- Seven damage.
- Cleave, cleave, cleave!

18:00.162 --> 18:03.958
- I fire two arrows.
- I drink from the Chalice of Knowing.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.169
Dingleberry smash!

18:07.461 --> 18:11.716
- Plus three, demonic eye look.
- Pull and shove it up them!

18:12.008 --> 18:14.010
After that,
I put one right behind the ear.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.053
I fire two...

18:17.138 --> 18:18.723
Sir Riggs, hand in character sheet.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.735
- Top floor, one door.
- I open it.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.528
- "Flame Strike."
- You did already.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.863
- Mace!
- Okay. Missed.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.657
- Hit him with a throwing dagger.
- Used all your knives.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.035
What?
Will one of you guys take care...?

18:39.327 --> 18:41.662
- What? You're all dead? I keep going.
- I follow.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.748
You've reached
the necromancer's workshop.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.751
You see his bed, bottles of goop,
some necromancing crap...

18:47.043 --> 18:48.252
but no necromancer.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.213
I search. Can I search
or are you gonna stab me in the back?

18:51.505 --> 18:53.883
Hey, I am a thief, not a wuss.
I search too.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.261
You find a secret door.
It's easy, already open.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.681
It leads to a ladder which goes
straight down to another open door...

19:00.973 --> 19:03.601
- on the back of the tower.
- Man. Way to go.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.353
That's great. He just got away.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.189
Hey, you can't just say he's gone.
You owe us an ending.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.983
I owe you nothing.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.652
I am a Dungeon Master.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.529
I create a boundless world,
and I bind it by rules.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.698
Too heavy for a bridge? It breaks.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.951
Get hit? Take damage. Spend an hour
outside someone's front door...

19:21.243 --> 19:24.372
fighting over who gets to kill him?
He leaves through the back.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.625
He's out there. You might find him,
if you get your crap together.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.127
Hey, guys.
Take it from a bunch of ghosts.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.837
This is no kind of life.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.256
You need fresh air and frozen yogurt.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.634
It's on me. Hug it out.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.636
- Gag me.
- Who even uses that phrase?

19:38.928 --> 19:40.304
I'm climbing down the ladder.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.265
- I'm gonna find this guy.
- I stay and search the workshop.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.143
- Any stuff there that can heal me?
- Some potions.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.812
Okay, well, I get half of that.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.480
You just went down the ladder.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.649
I can...
Can I hear him looting upstairs?

19:51.941 --> 19:53.317
Not if I move about silently.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.904
Fine, fine. If I heal you,
can we divide the potions?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.657
Okay, but I decide who gets what.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.659
Fine, but we've gotta be wary of traps.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.119
- Wand of Orcus.
- I don't...

20:03.411 --> 20:04.453
What's going on?

20:04.745 --> 20:09.125
- Give me a... I'm up to here with you.
- Want to get the necromancer or not?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.001
Do they like each other now?

20:11.293 --> 20:14.255
Are you kidding me? They can't stand
being in the same room.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.799
I also don't think
they can handle being apart.

20:17.091 --> 20:23.180
And I think they just found a way
to avoid doing either.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.854
And that's the best
most fathers and sons can do.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.440
You've made me so proud today.

20:34.275 --> 20:38.070
- Know where we can buy a real sword?
- Oh, Jeffrey.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.497
You're still at the entrance
to the Chamber of Grief.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.376
Your move, Mr. Tickles.

20:55.629 --> 20:59.216
You successfully pour more tea
into Count Frogula's cup.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.219
That puts it at Hillary Rodham Kitten.

21:02.511 --> 21:06.390
Okay, you attempt to pass crumpets.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.685
You fail.

21:09.977 --> 21:13.606
I'm getting frustrated. If you take a look
at your inventories, you'll see...

21:13.898 --> 21:15.191
Abed, are you almost done?

21:15.483 --> 21:17.026
I can't sleep without my stuffies.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.986
Fine. Hold on.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.823
Oh, a goblin notices you
and murders you all. You're dead.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.533
They're all yours.
