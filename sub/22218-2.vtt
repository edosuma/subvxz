This season on <i> Ink Master...</i>

00:04.754 --> 00:07.257
18 artists are battling it out

00:07.340 --> 00:09.426
to prove they're the best.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.555
It's master versus apprentice.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.515
{\an5}(Oliver)
The master-apprentice
relationship

00:15.598 --> 00:17.809
is a very sacred thing.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.436
(announcer)
On the last episode,

00:19.519 --> 00:21.938
masters tattooed head-to-head

00:22.021 --> 00:24.107
against their apprentices.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.276
{\an5}(Kito)
You want to beat the person
who taught you.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.902
It's my time to shine.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.571
I don't think that my tattoo
lost to his tattoo.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.572
This is bull[bleep].

00:30.655 --> 00:31.281
I'm a known artist.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.115
I've been around for 18 years.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.118
I can't go home
losing to Tyler Nolan.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.244
{\an1}We're gonna have to
go at it.

00:37.579 --> 00:41.249
{\an5}(announcer)
The losing artists had to
fight for their lives

00:41.332 --> 00:42.709
in the elimination tattoo.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.835
Ow.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.795
{\an5}(Duffy)
There is no way I'm gonna
let this bitch

00:45.879 --> 00:48.173
be the reason I'm going home.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.048
[groans]

00:49.132 --> 00:50.925

And a shocking twist

00:51.009 --> 00:52.886
rocks the competition.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.138
{\an5}(Dave)
This season,
the human canvas jury

00:55.221 --> 00:55.847
has even more power.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.224
The canvas wearing the tattoo

00:58.308 --> 00:59.809
that is voted the worst

00:59.893 --> 01:02.812
will come to the elimination
in person.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.563
That's horrible.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.732
[knuckles crack]

01:05.815 --> 01:06.941
(announcer)
In the elimination,

01:07.025 --> 01:08.777
Ryan, Chris, Brian, and Duffy

01:08.860 --> 01:11.196
were the bottom four.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.280
(Dave)
I got to ask.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.157
Why did the human canvas jury

01:14.240 --> 01:14.532
vote Duffy to the bottom?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.326
I didn't.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.577
It's things I asked for

01:17.660 --> 01:19.037
that they found
as imperfections.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.333
{\an5}(Chris)
It's shocking to me that a
cutesy little bug-eyed squirrel

01:23.416 --> 01:26.544
took out Odin, a phoenix,
and a devilish portrait.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.837
I disagree completely.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.340
{\an3}I don't believe
I should be down here.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.133
The amount of blowouts
you have in this outline

01:32.217 --> 01:33.551
and then putting that lavender
border around it.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.553
(Dave)
Ryan.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.013
First tattoo,
the main critique was,

01:37.096 --> 01:37.931
it was messy.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.224
Second tattoo, same thing.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.183
(Dave)
Brian.

01:40.266 --> 01:40.683
(Oliver)
When I get down to it,

01:40.767 --> 01:42.519
the fundamentals,

01:42.602 --> 01:44.062
this lettering
doesn't do it, man.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.940
{\an5}(Dave)
Brian, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.695
(announcer)
17 artists remain,

01:52.779 --> 01:57.742
but only one will
earn a $100,000 prize

01:57.826 --> 02:01.037
and the title of Ink Master.

02:04.123 --> 02:11.214
♪ ♪

02:55.758 --> 02:56.676
So how'd it go down there?

02:56.759 --> 02:57.719
{\an3}(Ryan)
It was rough.

02:57.802 --> 02:58.803
I took a lashing.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.013
{\an3}But now that I got that
first day out of the way,

03:00.096 --> 03:02.932
{\an1}I think I'm the one
to worry about.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.225
(Craig)
Badasses don't have to tell you

03:04.309 --> 03:05.184
that they're a badass.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.728
(Ryan)
It's confidence.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.730
There's a difference between
having confidence

03:08.813 --> 03:10.231
and stepping on your own dick.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.358
{\an8}(Ryan)
It's intimidation
that's coming out.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.192
{\an8}That's all I can [bleep] see.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.819
Like a dog,
you can smell fear,

03:14.903 --> 03:15.778
and it's all over them.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.822
I'm not gonna settle, though.

03:17.906 --> 03:18.948
The best of the best I know,

03:19.032 --> 03:19.991
we don't do that.

03:20.074 --> 03:20.950
[laughs]

03:21.034 --> 03:21.910
That's still your problem.

03:21.993 --> 03:22.785
{\an3}Because you said,
"The best of the best,

03:22.869 --> 03:25.330
<i>we</i> don't do that,"

03:25.413 --> 03:26.831
claiming that you're
the best of the best.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.041
That's your problem, dude.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.460
{\an3}You're not the best
of the best.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.879
I just want you to be
a normal human being

03:32.962 --> 03:34.380
and a cool tattooer, man,

03:34.464 --> 03:35.673

to tattooing.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.060
- Damn.
- Whoa.

03:47.143 --> 03:47.268
(man)
Wow.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.813
{\an3}This is gonna
be interesting.

{\an5}(Dave)
Welcome,
and congratulations

03:52.815 --> 03:55.818
on surviving your first week
in this competition.

03:55.902 --> 04:00.323
Remember, only one artist will
walk away with $100,000

04:00.406 --> 04:02.241
a feature in
<i>Inked</i> magazine,

04:02.325 --> 04:04.202

04:04.285 --> 04:05.662
[bleep] yeah.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.331
{\an5}(Dave)
This week, we have
a very special guest judge.

04:08.414 --> 04:12.126
The owner of Paradise Tattoo
in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

04:12.210 --> 04:15.838
he's been tattooing
for 35 years,

04:15.922 --> 04:18.675
and Oliver here
was his apprentice.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.468
Mr. Richard Stell.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.138
Awesome.

04:24.222 --> 04:24.973
(Katie voice-over)
Richard Stell is a pioneer.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.810
{\an8}I am both excited
and so nervous.

04:28.893 --> 04:29.769
All right, big buddy.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.646
{\an8}(Richard voice-over)
I taught Oliver Peck

04:31.729 --> 04:32.814
{\an8}how to tattoo.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.274
{\an8}He was kind of a pain
in the ass.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.942
I tried to steer him
in the right direction.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.402
He's taken it
and ran with it.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.528
What's up, mother[bleep]?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.029
[both laugh]

04:40.113 --> 04:42.407
{\an5}(Oliver voice-over)
I've been critiqued
by Richard Stell

04:42.490 --> 04:43.366
for years and years,

04:43.449 --> 04:44.367
leaning over my shoulder,

04:44.450 --> 04:45.952
cursing me out
at every wrong turn.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.704
{\an8}And it's helped me to be
a stronger tattoo artist.

04:47.787 --> 04:52.166
{\an5}(Dave)
This week, we're going directly
into an elimination tattoo.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.252
{\an1}Whoa.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.004
{\an5}(Dave)
You are being tested
on legibility.

04:56.087 --> 05:00.383
{\an8}(Earl voice-over)
If you cannot register what a
tattoo is within three seconds,

05:00.466 --> 05:02.218
{\an8}technically, it's wrong.

05:02.301 --> 05:04.095
You must tattoo a style

05:04.178 --> 05:06.139
that every master
should excel at

05:06.222 --> 05:07.432
and every apprentice
must conquer...

05:11.310 --> 05:13.187
American traditional.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.149
(Earl voice-over)
I didn't teach Dave

05:16.232 --> 05:18.151
anything to do with
American traditional.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.318
I'm not well versed in it.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.737
I surely do not feel like

05:20.820 --> 05:21.821
the master in this situation.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.824
{\an5}(Dave)
We are surrounded by authentic
airplanes

05:24.907 --> 05:27.076
from World War I
and World War II.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.287
During that time,
the American traditional style

05:29.370 --> 05:31.247
became increasingly popular.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.331
Colors were limited,

05:32.415 --> 05:34.917
so tattooers relied
on heavy use of black

05:35.001 --> 05:36.627
to create strong contrast.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.088
{\an8}(Kruseman)
This is what I've been doing
for the past 20 years,

05:39.172 --> 05:40.089
{\an8}and I'm really good at it.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.758
Richard Stell
is a tattoo legend,

05:41.841 --> 05:43.760
and I'm the only one
in this group

05:43.843 --> 05:46.095
that's gonna give him
what he wants to see.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.181
{\an5}(Dave)
Once again,
for this elimination tattoo,

05:48.264 --> 05:50.099
you will be competing
head-to-head

05:50.183 --> 05:51.976
with your master or apprentice,

05:52.060 --> 05:54.729
tattooing the same subject.

05:54.812 --> 05:55.688
{\an8}(Duffy)
Here I am,

05:55.772 --> 05:56.606
{\an8}head-to-head with Kruseman,

05:56.689 --> 05:59.025
{\an8}doing an American traditional
tattoo,

05:59.108 --> 06:00.026
{\an8}his comfort zone.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.778
I am freaking out.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.528
Let's bring out your canvases.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.494
The canvases are paired based on
what tattoo they want,

06:09.577 --> 06:10.745
and as a pair,
they will pick a skull.

06:10.828 --> 06:14.082
The master and apprentice's name
on the bottom of the skull

06:14.165 --> 06:15.458
will be their artists.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.751
As an added advantage,

06:16.834 --> 06:18.920
if you won your head-to-head
competition last week,

06:19.003 --> 06:21.297
you get to choose which canvas
you tattoo out of your pair.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.508
{\an8}(Tyler voice-over)
I'm super happy

06:23.591 --> 06:24.634
{\an8}that I have the advantage.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.427
Get to pick and choose
which one I want to do.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.639
Having a [bleep] canvas
in this competition

06:29.722 --> 06:32.517
can definitely
get you sent home.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.727
{\an5}(Dave)
Canvases who want
horseshoe tattoos,

06:34.811 --> 06:36.270
please choose a skull.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.149
Miami and Craig.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.945
{\an1}What do you want to
get done?

06:44.028 --> 06:45.196
{\an3}I want a horseshoe
on my thigh.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.489
{\an3}(man)
A horseshoe on my chest.

06:46.572 --> 06:46.989
{\an1}Any elements
you want added in?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.534
A dream catcher.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.576
Um...

06:50.660 --> 06:51.619
A what?

06:51.702 --> 06:52.912
{\an8}(Craig voice-over)
That has nothing to do

06:52.995 --> 06:54.038
{\an8}with American traditional.

06:54.122 --> 06:54.872
{\an8}Sorry, Miami.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.498
I'm going to pick
the young lady.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.545
Canvases who want mermaids,
you're up.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.672
Kruseman and Duffy.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.215
Anything particular with it
or just a mermaid?

07:04.298 --> 07:05.299
I'm open to interpretation.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.093
I would like her to be
on an anchor.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.094
I'm gonna pick the gentleman.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.471
{\an5}(Dave)
Canvases who want
a compass rose,

07:10.555 --> 07:11.472
choose a skull.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.224
Big Ceeze and Kito.

07:13.307 --> 07:15.434
Where do you want
your tattoo at?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.477
On my right forearm.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.979
Thigh area.

07:18.062 --> 07:18.771
I'm gonna go with the lady.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.190
(Dave)
Canvases who want anchors.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.233
Tyler and Chris.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.442
{\an1}Nice.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.694
So where do y'all
want to get 'em?

07:24.777 --> 07:25.820
{\an1}Arm?

07:25.903 --> 07:26.821
Left rib.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.197
[bleep].

07:28.281 --> 07:30.283
(Chris voice-over)
The skin on ribs stretches.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.577
That makes it really easy
to blow out lines.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.412
{\an8}This is not one I want at all.

07:36.581 --> 07:40.877
(Tyler)
Um...

07:40.960 --> 07:41.961
I'll go for the ribs.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.840
(Tyler voice-over)
I do traditional all the time,

07:45.923 --> 07:47.717
going head-to-head with somebody
that does realism.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.468
{\an8}So I'm not worried
about [bleep].

07:49.552 --> 07:52.430
Canvases who want gypsy girls,
you're up next.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.557
Matt and Katie.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.143
Where are you wanting to
put your tattoo.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.686
- Shoulder.
- Chest.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.479
(Katie)
I choose the young lady as well.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.524
Canvases who want a skull
and dagger.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.235
St. Marq and Ryan.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.236
Where do you want to go
with your tattoo?

08:07.320 --> 08:09.530
- On my right thigh.
- Left calf.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.907
I'm gonna choose the calf.

08:12.074 --> 08:12.909
(Dave)
Canvases who want snakes.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.411
Earl and Dave.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.372
Where you would
both like snakes.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.540
{\an3}Mine on my right
upper arm?

08:19.624 --> 08:20.958
I want mine
on my right calf,

08:21.042 --> 08:22.668
a snake wrapped around
a base guitar.

08:22.752 --> 08:23.669
Ooh, okay.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.088
- I'll take the right upper arm.
- All right.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.007
{\an8}(Dave voice-over)
I want to keep beating Earl,

08:28.090 --> 08:29.008
{\an8}so I'm taking the easy canvas.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.638
{\an8}Canvases who want
a clipper ship, you're up.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.143
Where at?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.477
- Upper arm.
- My thigh.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.313

I think I'll choose
the gentleman.

08:42.395 --> 08:45.399
{\an5}(Dave)
MV, last week, your apprentice
was eliminated.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.818
You've been assigned
an open canvas,

08:47.902 --> 08:49.111
and now you get to choose

08:49.195 --> 08:51.656
which pair of artists
you want to tattoo against.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.452
Only one of you will win,
and two of you will lose.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.665
{\an8}(MV voice-over)
I'm thinking more

09:00.748 --> 09:02.375
{\an8}about the subject matter
than who I'm going against.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.627
I'll tattoo the gypsy
against Matt and Katie.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.255
{\an8}(Katie voice-over)
MV going up against
Matt and myself

09:07.338 --> 09:07.964
{\an8}is the biggest mistake
he could've made

09:08.047 --> 09:10.383
{\an8}in this competition.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.467
Traditional is my [bleep].

09:11.550 --> 09:14.178
{\an5}(Dave)
The head-to-head battles
are set.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.764
Remember,
after the elimination tattoo,

09:16.847 --> 09:19.016
the human canvas jury
will vote on the tattoo

09:19.100 --> 09:19.934
that they think is the worst

09:20.017 --> 09:22.395
and put one artist up
for elimination.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.274
Head back to the shop
and get ready to tattoo.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.159
Okay, artists.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.328
You have five hours to do

09:39.412 --> 09:42.456
an American traditional tattoo,

09:42.540 --> 09:46.043
and your time begins now.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.837
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.046
{\an3}Lie down.

09:49.130 --> 09:49.672
Yeah, stand just like that.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.339
Get ready for battle.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.841
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.468
{\an8}(Oliver voice-over)
In these head-to-head challenges

09:54.552 --> 09:56.053
{\an8}where it's master
versus apprentice,

09:56.137 --> 09:57.179
if the master does well
and the apprentice does not,

09:57.263 --> 09:59.807
it's gonna show that they didn't
really do their job

09:59.890 --> 10:02.184
teaching this person everything
they should have known.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.728
If the apprentice does better
than the master,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.187
then it's gonna show that
that apprentice

10:05.271 --> 10:06.230
went above and beyond

10:06.314 --> 10:08.441
and learned more than
the master had to offer.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.445
I did not expect her skin

10:12.528 --> 10:13.612
to be as bad as it is.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.572
There are so many stretch marks.

10:14.655 --> 10:18.701
{\an8}It is so uneven
that I am scared to death

10:18.784 --> 10:19.744
{\an8}to have to put this tattoo here.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.957
{\an8}There's nothing
to do about it.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.667
{\an8}Going up against Marisa,
I'm gonna win again.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.211
She does more traditional stuff
back home than I do,

10:29.295 --> 10:30.546
but I'm not concerned.

10:30.629 --> 10:30.713
Let's do it.

Hey, at least he's
going through with it.

10:36.969 --> 10:37.928

On the chance that you can't
pull it off,

10:40.431 --> 10:41.349
I can't deal with that.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.392
Whoo!

10:43.476 --> 10:44.560
When I drew it up,
he's like,

10:44.644 --> 10:45.936
"Man, I don't know.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.521
I really don't know if you can
pull this one off."

10:47.605 --> 10:48.647
That sucks.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.232
{\an8}(Kito voice-over)
I need to prove to everyone

10:50.316 --> 10:51.984
{\an8}that I can do an American
traditional tattoo.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.235
- Let's get it poppin', baby.
- Let's do it.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.154
{\an8}This is definitely not

10:55.237 --> 10:56.405
{\an8}the work that I do back home.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.990
I've beaten Kito before,

10:58.074 --> 11:00.701
and I'm confident that I'm
still gonna beat Kito.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.244
All right, Craig,
what do you got going over here?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.081
Horseshoe and rose.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.876
{\an8}(Oliver voice-over)
Craig's just blatantly not
understanding the challenge.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.379
He's doing a new school tattoo

11:11.462 --> 11:14.215
with all these realistic
color saturations.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.633
Gonna leave some skin breaks.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.177
{\an3}And I'm just trying to leave
a lot of openings in it.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.261
(Oliver)
If you can't do the challenge,

11:19.345 --> 11:20.388
get the [bleep] out.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.515
Three more hours, guys.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.891
Three more hours.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.065

Oh, man.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.650
Look at how deliberate he is
all of a sudden.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.110
- Look at that, man.
- Look at this guy.

11:34.193 --> 11:38.280
{\an8}(Ryan voice-over)
The tattoo that I'm doing
is straight sarcasm.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.198
- That's some nice lines there.
- Thank you.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.241
It's what they asked for.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.284
It's protocol, buddy.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.620
Judges want black,
they want [bleep] lines,

11:44.703 --> 11:45.830
they're getting a lot of
Goddamned lines

11:45.913 --> 11:48.791
and a lot of Goddamned black
on top of black.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.380
{\an5}(Oliver)
It even sounds like
a traditional tattoo.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.256

I like this.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.007
It's going
in the right direction.

11:57.091 --> 11:57.925
Thank you very much.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.468
{\an1}I appreciate that
more than you know.

How do you think Duffy's doing
over there?

12:01.220 --> 12:04.181

She's definitely doing better
than some people in here are.

in [bleep] himself.

you go against

12:16.026 --> 12:17.153
for this particular challenge.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.614
This is the one area where
they're the most comfortable.

12:20.698 --> 12:24.577
I know that Matt can pull
some really clean lines,

12:24.660 --> 12:26.495
and Katie beat him last time.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.539

this is a game?

MV is playing the game badly.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.713
We're getting there.

One hour to go, guys.

the challenge was, you know?

{\an8}(Earl voice-over)
Not only is it a snake,

12:45.973 --> 12:46.849
{\an8}but I have to tattoo a guitar,

12:46.932 --> 12:49.518
{\an8}which is a bunch of
straight-ass lines.

more to me

on a daily basis

Everything's really smooth,
really stylized,

16:19.478 --> 16:21.814
{\an8}clearly meet the legibility part
of this challenge,

16:21.897 --> 16:23.607
{\an8}but Matt's is a little bit
more of a classic look.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.943
- Matt for the win.
- Matt.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.236
{\an8}(Dave)
The judges have decided.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.321
{\an8}Matt, you have won
your head-to-head competition.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.241
{\an3}Miami.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.243
{\an1}You went head-to-head
with Craig.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.244
I don't like it.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.453
This is basically new school.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.162
The horseshoe's grounded.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.164
It's balloony;
it's cartoony.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.749
Packed wall-to-wall,
solid color.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
There's really no contrast.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.002
10, 11 feet back,

16:44.086 --> 16:46.296
I don't know if I could tell
what this was.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.757
Craig.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.758
{\an5}(Oliver)
You did a cute
new school tattoo,

16:49.842 --> 16:52.136
but it's [bleep] wrong.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.470
Baby blue?
Neon green?

16:53.554 --> 16:55.431
It's insane.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.598
I'm a new school tattoo artist.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.558
It's a fight.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.977
Your brain wants to do
wall-to-wall color.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.520
(Oliver)
To win this competition,

17:01.603 --> 17:02.813
you have to do the challenges.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.940
A simple rose,
five petals.

17:05.022 --> 17:05.858
Boom, black, red, done.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.318
Showed y'all fools
that I can do it.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.945
Prove to everybody
that you're not just that guy

17:11.029 --> 17:13.031
that's trapped
in a new school bubble.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.160
(Dave)
All right, judges,

17:16.242 --> 17:18.787
let's debate a win
between Miami and Craig.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.664
{\an8}(Oliver)
I got problems
with both these tattoos,

17:20.748 --> 17:21.915
{\an8}but they're the same problems.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.459
I want to give Miami the win

17:23.541 --> 17:25.127
so that Craig
has to prove himself.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.297
{\an8}(Chris)
Craig's has less problems
in composition.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.339
{\an8}I'm going with Craig.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.091
(Dave)
Keyword today is "legibility."

17:31.175 --> 17:32.676
My vote is for Craig.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.261
Me too.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.971
{\an8}(Dave)
Craig, you have won

17:36.054 --> 17:37.389
{\an8}the head-to-head competition.

17:39.266 --> 17:40.851
Chris.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.145
You went head-to-head
with Tyler.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.938
The way the banners
kind of dribble off

17:45.022 --> 17:46.148
kind of bugs me.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.483
Banners should rise from
left to right, the other way.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.652
{\an5}(Oliver)
I will say that it does have
a traditional feel.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.363
It is bright,
and it's a striking tattoo.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.282
Tyler.

17:57.076 --> 17:57.868
I would've put
some more black shading

17:57.951 --> 17:59.953
in the bottom of that crossbeam,

18:00.037 --> 18:01.205
where it's the wood.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.332
Black it from the bottom,
give it a bit more depth.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.043
The weight of this outline
and how black the outline is

18:06.126 --> 18:07.252
and how solid it is,

18:07.336 --> 18:08.837
it just doesn't hit
the challenge.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.757
It's drawn as what would be
a traditional tattoo,

18:11.840 --> 18:13.425
but it's missing the strength.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.847
(Oliver)
The master and apprentice

18:18.931 --> 18:19.973
both have a lot of the same
strong attributes.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.683
{\an8}If I go strictly on legibility,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.852
{\an8}I'm gonna go for Tyler.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.354
{\an8}If I'm gonna go for
tough traditional,

18:25.437 --> 18:26.438
{\an8}I'm gonna go for Chris.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.023
It's legibility
as far as I'm concerned.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.191
My vote's for Tyler.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.984
I got to vote for Chris.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.569
- Chris.
- Chris.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.114
{\an8}(Dave)
The winner of this head-to-head
challenge is Chris.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.408
Erik.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.409
{\an1}You went head-to-head
with Marisa.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.620
{\an5}(Chris)
The overall appearance
of the ship

18:41.703 --> 18:42.329
is just very static.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.581
The water is very, very rigid.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.291
(Dave)
It's certainly a legible ship.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.043
There's a lot of majesty
to these things,

18:48.126 --> 18:51.797
and this design
is lacking in that area.

18:53.715 --> 18:54.800
{\an3}Marisa.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.678
(Oliver)
The ship looks like it's parked.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.720
It doesn't really have the feel

18:58.804 --> 18:59.388
that it's in the water.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.806
Doesn't really have the feel

19:00.889 --> 19:01.974
that it's going with the wind.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.976
The problem with these flowers
that attempt to be roses

19:04.059 --> 19:06.854
is that they just don't
look like a rose.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.021
Looks like an angry little dude

19:08.105 --> 19:09.731
with white eyebrows
and a mustache.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.984
(Oliver)
It's really crazy.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.653
{\an8}Neither one of these two

19:14.736 --> 19:16.738
{\an8}really excel
in the American traditional.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.615
Erik's tattoo being
so much cleaner,

19:18.699 --> 19:20.409
I'm gonna vote for Erik.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.618
- Erik.
- Erik.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.578
{\an8}(Dave)
Erik, you've won

19:22.661 --> 19:23.912
{\an8}the head-to-head competition.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.039
Kruseman.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.125
You went head-to-head
with Duffy.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.126
I really like the mermaid.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.377
Very nice black shading.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.920
Color saturation here is great.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.297
Color palette is great.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.883
But you don't just blanket
someone's entire arm

19:35.966 --> 19:37.217
with little stars and dots.

19:37.301 --> 19:41.305
Stars and dots are filler
in between tattoos.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.432
I just went for it.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.808
You [bleep] ruined
this guy's arm

19:44.892 --> 19:45.225
with these [bleep] stars
and dots.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.521
Duffy.

19:50.814 --> 19:51.940
I like the overall layout of it.

19:52.024 --> 19:52.691
That face will hold
up over the years.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.776
I like it.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.445
The rope, where it's shaded
with the black,

19:56.528 --> 19:58.196
looks so much nicer than
where it's not.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.865
It shows why black is important.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.910
It shows why being able to pull
a subtle little trick

20:02.993 --> 20:05.037
gives the tattoo more power.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.915
(Dave)
Time to be debate winner.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.708
{\an8}- It's the closest battle
- I agree.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.126
{\an8}(Richard)
I like both of them.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.045
{\an8}(Chris)
For me, Kruseman's tattoo
is deliberate.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.338
I'm going with Kruseman.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.673
Kruseman, I'm giving you a pass
on these stars and dots.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.008
The judges have decided.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.218
{\an8}Kruseman, you've won
the head-to-head competition.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.513
{\an3}St. Marq.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.806
You went head-to-head with Ryan.

20:24.890 --> 20:28.310
{\an5}(Chris)
The skull, it's very stylized
and kind of rocky.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.311
It's just not heavy.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.062
(Richard)
The dagger seems overdone

20:30.145 --> 20:32.230
while the skull seems underdone.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.067
It just doesn't smack of
traditional.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.778
{\an3}Ryan.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.491
This thing is just
[bleep] weird, man.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.452
Where I think you went
totally haywire on this tattoo

20:45.535 --> 20:48.538
is basically just coloring
this thing solid black.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.748
Just trying to take things down

20:49.831 --> 20:51.583
quite a few notches
from what I normally do.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.502
Not put style into it,
just go simple.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.046
From a distance, you literally
have a big black silhouette.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.381
(Richard)
Everything is black,

20:57.464 --> 20:59.091
and it's gonna get blacker
as it gets older.

20:59.174 --> 20:59.341
It's got nowhere to go.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.804
{\an8}The two things
we're judging for today,

21:03.887 --> 21:05.514
{\an8}traditional and legibility,

21:05.597 --> 21:08.183
{\an8}St. Marq's is far and above
on both those points.

21:08.266 --> 21:08.684
St. Marq.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.644
Same here.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.645
{\an8}(Dave)
The winner of this

21:11.728 --> 21:13.438
{\an8}head-to-head challenge
is St. Marq.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.608
Big Ceeze.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.151
You went head-to-head with Kito.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.278
(Oliver)
From a distance,

21:19.361 --> 21:20.612
this thing is legible,

21:20.696 --> 21:22.823
but up close, it's got
a lot of sloppiness to it.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.074
There's a lot of hiccups
in these pearl beads.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.660
Where that rose
meets the compass,

21:26.743 --> 21:28.370
there's just
a clear white streak

21:28.453 --> 21:29.538
where the red didn't go
all the way to the line.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.707
{\an5}(Big Ceeze)
I thought I got to the line,
but--

21:31.790 --> 21:33.000
{\an5}(Oliver)
Everything you do
in this competition

21:33.083 --> 21:34.710
is under a microscope.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.295
{\an3}Kito.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.842
{\an5}(Chris)
The tattoo looks heavy,
but not in a good way.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.802
And you didn't let the details

21:43.885 --> 21:45.929
that you have in the bird itself
stand out.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.305
It looks like you were trying to
hide something somewhere

21:47.389 --> 21:49.433
and the background on this thing
makes no sense.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.227
{\an3}I thought about that minute
after I did it.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.729
It seemed like a good idea
at first.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.313
(Chris)
Red on red is camouflage.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.109
{\an8}For me, legibility-wise,

21:59.192 --> 22:01.945
{\an8}Big Ceeze takes this down
without question.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.363
I vote for Ceeze.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.114
- Big Ceeze.
- Big Ceeze.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.449
{\an8}(Dave)
The judges have decided.

22:05.532 --> 22:11.413
{\an8}Big Ceeze, you've won
the head-to-head competition.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.164
Earl.

22:12.247 --> 22:15.459
You went head-to-head with Dave.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.878
I don't understand
what's happening with the snake.

22:17.961 --> 22:18.795
There's no belly.
There's no belly scales.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.756
There's no teeth.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.007
(Oliver)
Is that little look

22:22.090 --> 22:23.633
that you just realized
you forgot teeth?

22:23.717 --> 22:25.302
I totally did not
put teeth in it.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.846
(Oliver)
I think it's pretty [bleep] up.

22:27.929 --> 22:29.347
They obviously have
belly scales.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.224
And if they're gonna turn
and twist,

22:31.308 --> 22:33.268
at some point, you're gonna see
the belly scale.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.897
You missed the mark from
conception to completion.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.648
- You look shook.
- I am.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.608
This one got you.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.360
{\an3}Dave.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.280
{\an5}(Chris)
Aesthetically, I wish you
would've put

22:45.363 --> 22:47.616
a little more time
into this drawing

22:47.699 --> 22:48.158
to make it more interesting.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.160
Your whip shading,

22:50.243 --> 22:52.788
where you take the black
and pepper it out into nothing,

22:52.871 --> 22:53.955
looks strong.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.916
It's some of the strongest
whip shading we've seen.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.125
Very much on point.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.128
{\an8}(Oliver)
There's really
not much debate for me

23:00.212 --> 23:01.296
{\an8}on this one at all.

23:01.379 --> 23:02.255
{\an1}Earl, man,

23:02.339 --> 23:03.715
this snake is just bad.

23:03.799 --> 23:04.424
{\an1}(Richard)
It's a rattlesnake

23:04.508 --> 23:06.093
that ain't got no teeth, man.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.594
Y'all like beating
a dead horse, man.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.056
{\an3}Give him the lesson
that he needs to be told,

23:11.139 --> 23:13.433
and then [bleep] move on.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.810
[knuckles crack]

23:14.893 --> 23:16.686
{\an5}(Chris)
Well, let me explain
one thing to you.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.146
What you just got 30 seconds of,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.774
this is what it was
for us as apprentices.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.150
I got slapped out of the chair.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.944
I got called everything
under the sun.

23:24.027 --> 23:26.154
I wouldn't change the way
I grew up for anything.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.155
This is my friend here.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.200
He gave me lessons
that I needed to evolve,

23:30.283 --> 23:32.202
and it's tough seeing somebody
that you care about

23:32.285 --> 23:33.453
getting bashed like that.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.663
I know it seems harsh.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.623
These tattoos are looked at
under a microscope,

23:36.706 --> 23:37.707
and there's 16 other people

23:37.791 --> 23:39.251
that are fighting
to kick you out of here.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.669
You've got to tighten it up.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.963
Nothing's 100%, but that's what
you got to strive for.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.550
{\an3}So, let's get
a final decision here.

23:46.633 --> 23:47.134
{\an8}(Oliver)
I'm going with Dave.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.552
{\an8}- Dave.
- Dave.

23:48.635 --> 23:52.430
{\an8}The winner of this head-to-head
competition is Dave.

23:54.474 --> 23:57.018
Congratulations to
the eight of you

23:57.102 --> 23:58.645
who won your
head-to-head battles.

23:58.728 --> 24:02.023
You are safe from elimination.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.567
However...

24:03.650 --> 24:06.653
you now have a very important
decision to make

24:06.736 --> 24:10.031
about the fate
of your competitors.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.658
The eight of you,
as a group,

24:11.741 --> 24:13.451
will have a heavy hand
in determining

24:13.535 --> 24:15.287
who is eliminated this week.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.547
{\an5}(Dave)
For the eight of you that won
your head-to-head competition,

24:25.630 --> 24:26.590
you are safe from elimination.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.846
However, you now have a very
important decision to make

24:32.929 --> 24:34.639
about the fate
of your competitors.

24:38.810 --> 24:42.647
The eight of you will form
a jury of peers.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.065
Based on the tattoos today,

24:44.149 --> 24:48.153
you will pick two artists
to put up for elimination.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.822
The human canvas jury will
also pick one artist

24:50.906 --> 24:52.073
to put up for elimination.

24:52.157 --> 24:55.118
The three artists nominated
must face off

24:55.202 --> 24:57.245
tattooing an American
traditional design

24:57.329 --> 24:59.748
to avoid elimination.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.042
The power is in the hands
of the jury.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.381
Head back to the loft
and get ready.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.845
{\an8}All right,
we're here to figure out

25:13.929 --> 25:15.639
{\an8}who has the worst tattoo
of the day.

25:16.806 --> 25:19.643
This is my tattoo,
and my artist was Earl.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.686
(woman)
I think it's really busy,

25:21.770 --> 25:24.606
and frankly,
the snake is terrible.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.650
{\an5}(woman)
That way that the snake
is shaped,

25:26.733 --> 25:27.317
feel like it looks like
a ribbon.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.068
- Like a ribbon.
- Yeah.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.695
(woman)
It's so flat.

25:30.779 --> 25:31.821
Don't look right.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.282
This is my tattoo,

25:34.366 --> 25:35.325
and my artist was Kito.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.118
Supposed to be a compass rose
as the subject.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.453
We added the crow in.

25:38.536 --> 25:42.791
It doesn't even read
as a compass rose though.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.000
You can barely tell what it is.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.044
(woman)
The random red spots from behind

25:46.127 --> 25:47.337
takes away from the rose.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.047
{\an5}(man)
From a distance, it's gonna
look like a black spot

25:49.130 --> 25:51.299
with a rash underneath.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.009
{\an5}(woman)
It should have more skin breaks
in it

25:53.093 --> 25:54.886
to try to break up that heavy,
heavy black.

25:54.970 --> 25:55.929
The rose I like.

25:56.012 --> 25:56.972
I like the crow too.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.348
(woman)
But, still, the bottom line is,

25:58.431 --> 25:59.432
he didn't do the challenge.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.518
It's not American traditional.

26:03.270 --> 26:06.439
{\an5}(woman)
This is my tattoo,
and it's done by Ryan.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.692
It's really dark,
and the only thing

26:08.775 --> 26:09.776
that I can honestly appreciate
on it

26:09.859 --> 26:11.611
is the gold tooth
and the handle of the dagger.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.322
{\an5}(woman)
It doesn't look like
a human skull.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.448
It looks like a bowling ball.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.784
(man)
That skull should be cracked.

26:17.867 --> 26:18.952
It looks like a flesh wound.

26:19.035 --> 26:19.911
I'm upset about that,

26:19.995 --> 26:20.787
and I'm also upset about

26:20.870 --> 26:23.707
the dagger being
completely crooked.

26:25.125 --> 26:26.251
I'm bummed.

26:29.921 --> 26:30.839
{\an1}(Big Ceeze)
So, Earl,

26:30.922 --> 26:31.840
what'd you think about Dave

26:31.923 --> 26:33.508
speaking up for you like that,
man?

26:33.591 --> 26:34.509
I didn't flinch.

26:34.592 --> 26:35.468
I never flinch.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.678
{\an3}I take everything
with respect.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.180
You didn't have to
[bleep] speak for me.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.099
I can speak
for my [bleep] self.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.351
It's a rattlesnake
that ain't got no teeth, man.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.102
Y'all like beating
a dead horse, man.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.354
[bleep] move on.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.356
He was pissed off
because they were mad at you.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.567
{\an4}(Dave)
It's just the way
they [bleep] made fun of it.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.612
{\an8}(Dave voice-over)
I joined the army
at 19 years old.

26:54.696 --> 26:55.530
I'm a fighter.

26:55.613 --> 26:56.906
We don't surrender in the army,

26:56.990 --> 26:58.658
and we don't leave
anybody behind.

26:58.742 --> 26:59.617
Bottom line.

26:59.701 --> 27:00.744
For Christ's sake,

27:00.827 --> 27:03.204
{\an3}don't [bleep] keep beating
a person down.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.205
That's their job.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.206
They're the judges.

27:05.290 --> 27:08.418
Just drop it, dude.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.045
(Kruseman)
They're gonna beat all of us up.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.088
You can't suck it up
and take it like a man,

27:12.172 --> 27:12.672
you're in the wrong place.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.341
Back the [bleep] up

27:14.424 --> 27:15.342
right the [bleep] now

27:15.425 --> 27:16.968
before I lose it.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.065
We're here as the jury of peers

27:30.148 --> 27:31.524
to put two artists up
for elimination.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.110
{\an5}(Matt)
You guys, this isn't
gonna be easy.

27:34.194 --> 27:37.238
{\an1}Let's do this as just and fair
as possible

27:37.322 --> 27:39.949
so nobody is shortchanged.

27:40.033 --> 27:40.950
Let's just get rolling.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.285
I think it should be Ryan,

27:42.369 --> 27:43.536
because I know he wants to
go down there and challenge.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.081
(Matt)
This is my absolute bottom.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.791
It just looks like
not give a [bleep]

27:47.874 --> 27:49.793
from the minute he sat down
with a pencil

27:49.876 --> 27:52.170
all the way to the finish
of the tattoo.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.630
{\an5}(Kruseman)
Ryan knocked
traditional tattooing.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.508
He made fun of it
through the whole drawing,

27:56.591 --> 27:58.093
and he made a fool of himself
by doing that.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.095
{\an5}(St. Marq)
Honestly, I don't know where
his head was at at all.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.180
Ryan is not the most likeable
person on the planet,

28:02.263 --> 28:04.891
but this one is not my least
favorite one of the day.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.560
{\an5}(Dave)
The bottom in my book
would be Kito.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.146
It's just a little
too dark overall.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.439
(St. Marq)
I don't agree about Kito.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.316
I'm leaning more towards Earl's.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.609
{\an5}(Kruseman)
There's not teeth;
there's no belly.

28:14.692 --> 28:17.112
{\an5}(Dave)
See, I don't agree
with that one,

28:17.195 --> 28:19.406
because Kito's bird
is killing me.

28:19.489 --> 28:20.448
You can add teeth,

28:20.532 --> 28:21.991
but you can't [bleep]
fix that bird.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.618
You can't put a belly on it;
it's a ribbon.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.036
They're both jacked up.

28:25.120 --> 28:25.912
You can't tell
it's a rattlesnake.

28:25.995 --> 28:27.747
That's a low blow,
and you know it.

28:27.831 --> 28:28.832
I agree with
St. Marq.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.583
Look at the snake;
it looks like a ribbon.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.586
Still, we got to take in
consideration execution too.

28:33.670 --> 28:34.796
Definitely MV.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.673
He missed the mark
quite heavily.

28:36.756 --> 28:37.799
{\an5}(Matt)
That earring is hanging
from an ear

28:37.882 --> 28:40.635
that would have to be
on top of her head.

28:40.718 --> 28:42.220
(Kruseman)
Did it look a little wonky?

28:42.303 --> 28:43.096
Sure.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.681
But he didn't leave
her lips out.

28:44.764 --> 28:45.849
There was an eye.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.350
I mean, everything that was
supposed to be there

28:47.434 --> 28:48.184
was supposed to be there.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.520
I'm gonna completely say
hell no,

28:50.603 --> 28:52.021
because MV's tattoos,

28:52.105 --> 28:54.232
they [bleep] chewed his ass up
on the line.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.817
You look at Earl's black,

28:55.900 --> 28:56.484
it's solid as can be.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.362
Go back to MV's, blotchy.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.489
Back to the line work,
solid and clean.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.366
MV's had some shaky lines.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.033
So there you go.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.994
'Nuff said.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.665
(Kruseman)
I want that kid out of here.

29:10.748 --> 29:11.833
I hate cocky sons of bitches,

29:11.916 --> 29:12.792
and I'm not gonna [bleep]
put up with him.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.086
You don't think it was
[bleep] sabotage?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.838
{\an1}The only person that could
beat you would be me.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.632
[bleep], did your brain fall out
of your ass[bleep]?

29:21.468 --> 29:24.971
[dramatic music]

29:25.054 --> 29:26.973
[rock music]

♪ ♪

29:30.185 --> 29:31.269
Today,

29:31.352 --> 29:32.729
three artists will face off,

29:32.812 --> 29:36.357
fighting for their survival
in this competition.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.818
Let's find out who the human
canvas jury determined

29:38.902 --> 29:41.279
had the worst tattoo of the day.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.243
Kito, the human canvas jury

29:47.327 --> 29:49.329
{\an1}determined that you had
the worst tattoo of the day.

29:49.412 --> 29:51.623
I don't think so.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.125
{\an5}(Dave)
Gavin, why did the jury
vote Kito to the bottom?

29:54.209 --> 29:57.837
The jury determined that
the tattoo was not legible

29:57.921 --> 30:01.633
and that the background
with the red shading

30:01.716 --> 30:03.551
made it very unreadable.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.720
{\an5}(Dave)
Did you share the opinions
of the jury?

30:05.803 --> 30:08.264
I don't love the red background,

30:08.348 --> 30:09.516
But I'm very happy
with the tattoo.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.101
Which one were you voting for?

30:12.185 --> 30:14.437
I voted for Earl's tattoo,
the snake with the guitar.

30:14.521 --> 30:17.232
The other one that we discussed

30:17.315 --> 30:19.776
was the skull
that was very, very black.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.945
Everything in the tattoo
just was really oversaturated

30:22.028 --> 30:22.904
and hard to read.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.406
Thank you for coming
and joining us.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.574
Thanks, guys.

30:27.825 --> 30:28.910
{\an1}(Dave)
Kito.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.912
That means you're
the first artist

30:30.995 --> 30:31.871
facing off today.

30:31.955 --> 30:35.083
Jury of peers,
step over to this side.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.464
Eight of you won
your head-to-head battle.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.509
It was up to you to determine
which of the artists

30:44.592 --> 30:47.595
must face off with Kito.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.056
Who is the first artist

30:50.139 --> 30:51.891
that you're putting up
for elimination.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.480
We've all decided Ryan.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.315
The skull's just black.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.609
It's not really legible
from a distance.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.946
I'm always up
to redeem myself again.

31:05.029 --> 31:05.947
I ain't giving up.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.407
Who's the second artist

31:07.490 --> 31:09.117
you are putting up
for elimination?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.369
The second artist is...

31:11.452 --> 31:14.038
Earl.

31:14.122 --> 31:14.747
Mainly because of the snake,

31:14.831 --> 31:16.541
and it was a little cluttered.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.627
It [bleep] sucks,
but I got it.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.170
I'm always up for the challenge.

31:24.215 --> 31:24.716
The decision has been made.

31:24.799 --> 31:28.261
Ryan, Earl, and Kito,

31:28.344 --> 31:31.889
{\an3}the three of you must face off
to avoid elimination.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.808
Fail, and one of you
will lose your shot

31:33.891 --> 31:38.354
at $100,000
and the title of Ink Master.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.649
Grab your machines.

31:53.077 --> 31:56.289
{\an8}(Earl)
I am definitely not used to
[bleep] losing.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.583
{\an8}It sucks.

31:58.666 --> 32:02.420
{\an8}I feel a bit lost,
and I feel a bit insulted.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.838
(Kito)
Right now, I got the opportunity

32:03.921 --> 32:04.714
to do a lot of
proving people wrong.

32:04.797 --> 32:07.008
They think I'm the underdog.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.345
{\an8}That's the type of pressure
I take and use as fuel.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.387
{\an8}(Ryan)
Coming off the last tattoo
I did,

32:11.471 --> 32:13.806
{\an8}I went way too overboard,
'cause I'm a smartass.

32:13.890 --> 32:14.766
It bit me in the ass.

32:14.849 --> 32:15.725
So I'm gonna show 'em today

32:15.808 --> 32:17.185
that this is why I need to
be here.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.066
The three of you...

32:24.609 --> 32:25.568
have been put up for elimination

32:25.652 --> 32:28.780
by the jury of peers
and the human canvas jury.

32:28.863 --> 32:32.075
You've each been randomly
assigned a human canvas,

32:32.158 --> 32:35.912
and you will have four hours
to complete your tattoo.

32:35.995 --> 32:39.624
For this face-off,
you must tattoo an eagle

32:39.707 --> 32:41.501
created by Richard Stell.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.338
{\an5}(Ryan)
Richard Stell original drawing
of an eagle.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.464
Looks very flat.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.424
I don't like it.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.467
Do it nice, do it clean.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.760
Don't get tricky with it.

32:50.843 --> 32:51.511
Don't get all colorful with it.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.721
Traditional standards.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.556
{\an5}(Earl)
Richard Stell
is very intimidating.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.392
If you do not live up to
his standards,

32:57.475 --> 32:58.601
you're just going to be
eliminated.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.937
Let's bring in your canvases.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.647
Hey, I'm Jack.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.023
- What's going on, man?
- Brett.

33:04.107 --> 33:04.941
(Dave)
Artists,

33:05.024 --> 33:06.484
now is the time
to prove yourselves.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.736
If you can't create
a legible tattoo,

33:08.820 --> 33:10.947
you'll be packing your machines,

33:11.030 --> 33:14.283
and your time begins now.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.036
{\an5}(Earl)
Let's put that stencil on,
brother.

33:17.120 --> 33:17.662
{\an1}I don't want to, like,
roll over too far

33:17.745 --> 33:19.747
to where you can't see it.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.249
{\an8}(Oliver)
There's hard things
and easy things

33:21.332 --> 33:22.500
{\an8}about this face-off.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.460
You know you have a good, solid
eagle to work from.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.753
(Earl)
Yeah, feel good about that.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.130
(Oliver)
The hard part,

33:27.213 --> 33:29.215
if you don't know how this is
supposed to be shaded,

33:29.298 --> 33:29.924
and how it's
supposed to be colored,

33:30.007 --> 33:32.427
you could do it totally wrong

33:32.510 --> 33:33.845
and get sent home.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.809
I do not do
American traditional.

33:39.892 --> 33:40.727
Every line's got to be perfect.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.937
(Earl)
It's just a lot of pressure.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.106
Dave does American traditional
all the time.

33:45.189 --> 33:48.484
I'm taking every piece of advice
he gives me.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.986
(Dave)
Nice, thick, heavy black,

33:50.069 --> 33:51.362
and then whip off of it.

33:51.446 --> 33:51.738
Just trying to breathe.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.573
[laughs]

33:53.656 --> 33:55.241
(Earl voice-over)
To be at the bottom of this

33:55.324 --> 33:57.118
is probably one of the most
embarrassing [bleep] things

33:57.201 --> 33:58.119
that I've ever dealt with.

33:58.202 --> 33:59.162
I'm stuck in a [bleep] hole,

33:59.245 --> 34:00.496
and I have to get
the [bleep] up.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.080
That's a two-hour outline.

34:01.164 --> 34:01.706
Taking his time on it.

34:01.789 --> 34:02.623
{\an1}(Earl)
I got to make sure

34:02.707 --> 34:04.917
it's right for you guys.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.377
(St. Marq)
Just keep your pace up,

34:06.461 --> 34:07.670
and you'll have time to nitpick.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.257
{\an1}You ain't putting on color,
right?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.300
(Kito)
Mm-mm.

34:12.382 --> 34:13.842
My strategy is to make it
dark and bold.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.636
Make it to where it's gonna hold

34:15.719 --> 34:16.596
for the next 20, 30 years
at least.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.556
Trying to make sure I got

34:18.639 --> 34:20.266
{\an3}the same line weight
on everything.

34:20.349 --> 34:21.768
I'm about to bust
this [bleep] down.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.311
Two hours to go, everybody.

34:23.393 --> 34:24.603
(Oliver)
In the first tattoo,

34:24.687 --> 34:27.482
these artists had
nothing but problems.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.442
Looking at all three of these
tattoos in progress,

34:29.525 --> 34:30.650
I'm impressed.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.779
All three have really strong
line work.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.489
(Kruseman)
Focus on that leg.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.283
Don't let yourself get
too carried away.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.494
{\an8}(Kruseman voice-over)
There's certain people
that I want to help.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.204
{\an8}And there's certain people
that I don't want to help.

34:41.286 --> 34:42.038
I'm not gonna give
one piece of advice,

34:42.121 --> 34:44.123
'cause I want that kid
out of here.

34:44.206 --> 34:45.666
I hate cocky sons of bitches,

34:45.750 --> 34:47.251
and I'm not gonna [bleep]
put up with him.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.960
Do black in there.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.545
{\an3}Set that back,
and when you do just--

34:51.922 --> 34:53.757
St. Marq is breathing down
the back of my neck.

34:53.841 --> 34:54.759
Make sure you get that.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.803
Dude will not back off.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.304
Yellow, yellow, yellow.

34:58.387 --> 34:59.972
{\an5}(Ryan)
Do this, do that.
Do this, do that.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.015
It's messing with my mind.

35:01.098 --> 35:03.392
(St. Marq)
You got to put yellow there.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.311
{\an3}I'd brush through that
and get rid of that.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.313
{\an8}Ryan isn't listening to
a [bleep] thing that I say.

35:07.396 --> 35:10.316
You can't just put yellow
straight with black, dude.

35:10.399 --> 35:11.400
It turns green.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.318
(St. Marq)
I'm not sure if he thinks

35:12.401 --> 35:14.362
that I'm trying to misguide him.
I'm not.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.781
If you want to be arrogant,
that's fine.

35:16.864 --> 35:17.990
He's gonna be going home.

35:18.074 --> 35:18.533
(Dave)
Five...

35:18.616 --> 35:20.368
Four...

35:20.451 --> 35:21.619
Three...

35:21.702 --> 35:22.620
Two...

35:22.703 --> 35:23.704
One.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.373
That's it.
Machines down.

35:25.456 --> 35:25.706
Time is up.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.333
{\an1}I'm good.

35:27.416 --> 35:28.292
(Dave)
No more ink.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.085
It was really stressful, bro.

35:29.168 --> 35:31.462
(Kito)
Looking at Earl's tattoo,

35:31.546 --> 35:33.005
the line work is not solid.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.216
The red spots in the tail
shouldn't be there.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.467
Earl, you not listening, man?

35:36.551 --> 35:36.884
Like, what are you doing?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.469
[Earl sighs]

35:39.554 --> 35:43.140
[rock music]

35:46.185 --> 35:47.895
{\an3}(St. Marq)
I'm [bleep] pissed at you.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.064
{\an3}I wanted you to annihilate
these [bleep] two guys.

35:50.147 --> 35:51.065
(Ryan)
I was in my groove

35:51.148 --> 35:52.316
before you came in
and started saying,

35:52.400 --> 35:53.901
"You need to do this,
you need to do that,

35:53.985 --> 35:54.902
you need to do that."

35:54.986 --> 35:55.903
You haven't won.

35:55.987 --> 35:56.863
I told you.

35:56.946 --> 35:58.406
{\an3}All you got to do
is [bleep] leave it.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.991
I mean, what the [bleep]
are you doing?

36:00.074 --> 36:01.200
Your arms were just in my way.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.994
I was trying to save you
from yourself.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.412
You were between my canvas
and me.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.913
I don't want you
to overcomplicate it.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.248
Hold on, whoa, wait.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.418
You don't think it was
[bleep] sabotage?

36:10.501 --> 36:11.919
Did your brain fall out of
your ass[bleep]?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.921
{\an3}You think I'm
trying to, like,

36:14.005 --> 36:14.922
guide you the wrong way?

36:15.006 --> 36:16.507
Think I'm trying to
[bleep] you up?

36:16.591 --> 36:16.924
- Yeah.
- No, really?

36:17.008 --> 36:18.759
Really, why?

36:18.843 --> 36:20.052
(Ryan)
When it comes down to it,

36:20.136 --> 36:22.555
the only person that could
beat you would be me.

36:22.638 --> 36:25.099
You're not even gonna be there
to [bleep] try.

36:25.182 --> 36:25.308
We'll see.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.277
Kito...

36:36.360 --> 36:37.278
Earl...

36:37.361 --> 36:38.446
and Ryan.

36:38.529 --> 36:41.157
You faced off tattooing
an American traditional design

36:41.240 --> 36:42.867
by Richard Stell.

36:42.950 --> 36:47.038
Today, one of you will be
packing your machine.

36:47.872 --> 36:48.873
First of all,
guys, I want to say,

36:48.956 --> 36:52.543
you came out with three
really strong tattoos.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.921
This is definitely the
best three tattoos we've seen

36:55.004 --> 36:57.173
on American traditional day

36:57.256 --> 36:59.258
in probably the history
of <i> Ink Master.</i>

36:59.342 --> 37:01.177
Good job, guys.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.345
(Dave)
Kito, let's start with you.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.808
(Oliver)
Kito's is very strong.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.436
It's got the right proportion
of bold line

37:10.519 --> 37:12.146
to black shading to open skin.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.189
{\an5}(Richard)
The only thing that bugs me
about it is,

37:13.272 --> 37:15.900
the little feathers
shaded individually

37:15.983 --> 37:16.859
kind of gives it
that scale look,

37:16.943 --> 37:18.653
draws your eye away
from the rest of it.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.905
If you would have shaded
those scales instead,

37:20.988 --> 37:21.948
then it wouldn't be
so noticeable

37:22.031 --> 37:24.659
that the wing isn't as black
as it should be.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.869
{\an5}(Kito)
I was just being self-conscious
about overdoing it.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.162
Because it's so simple,

37:28.245 --> 37:31.165
it's very simple
to [bleep] it up.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.502
Earl.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.923
{\an5}(Oliver)
The outline is great
on this one.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.675
You really sunk it in there,

37:40.758 --> 37:42.051
but from the neck to the wing,

37:42.134 --> 37:44.512
where you left that
little highlight,

37:44.595 --> 37:45.763
could've just been filled in.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.682
Not necessarily the right way
to do it,

37:47.765 --> 37:49.767
but in this tattoo,
I think it works.

37:49.850 --> 37:50.935
Thank you.

37:51.018 --> 37:51.894
It looks great.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.479
The shading in the claws.

37:53.562 --> 37:54.689
I like the shading in the head.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.940
I really can't complain.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.483
- I like it.
- Thank you.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.487
Ryan.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.906
(Chris)
The quality of this tattoo

38:03.990 --> 38:05.825
is the best craftsmanship
I've seen you do

38:05.908 --> 38:07.284
since you got here.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.869
The shoulders and crests
of the wings are my favorite.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.246
The shading down the center

38:10.329 --> 38:12.748
as opposed to one side
or the other,

38:12.832 --> 38:14.709
this looks like
it's actually the crest.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.712
But the stippling dot work
in the eagle's head,

38:17.795 --> 38:20.798
that's not the best choice.

38:20.881 --> 38:21.549
It's a mistake.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.634
It makes it, like, overly dark,

38:23.718 --> 38:24.218
makes it look like it's dirty.

38:24.301 --> 38:24.969
It's not traditional.

38:25.052 --> 38:27.054
(Ryan)
I took in my critiques

38:27.138 --> 38:29.890
from my master here.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.934
I think if I would've just
left it as it was...

38:32.018 --> 38:32.977
So it's St. Marq's fault.

38:33.060 --> 38:33.978
It's every man for himself.

38:34.061 --> 38:34.979
Why you pointing the finger?

38:35.062 --> 38:36.230
I ain't pointing
any fingers here.

38:36.313 --> 38:37.231
He didn't grab the machine out
your hand

38:37.315 --> 38:38.441
to do the tattoo;
you did it.

38:38.524 --> 38:41.235
You always got somebody
to blame, every time, man.

38:41.318 --> 38:41.902
[bleep], no,
I ain't blaming anybody.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.863
I'm just saying, like--

38:43.946 --> 38:44.822
I got something to prove,

38:44.905 --> 38:46.073
but the homie over here,

38:46.157 --> 38:47.116
he just dodging the bullet.

38:47.199 --> 38:48.576
I should've just
listened to myself

38:48.659 --> 38:51.328
and just stayed with
what I was doing.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.584
(Dave)
Time to debate this thing out.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.586
{\an8}Three badass, bold tattoos here.

38:58.669 --> 38:59.503
{\an8}Do you have a favorite
of the day?

38:59.587 --> 39:01.589
{\an8}(Oliver)
If I walked in off the street

39:01.672 --> 39:03.090
{\an8}and got any one of these
three tattoos,

39:03.174 --> 39:04.341
{\an8}I'd be stoked with it.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.926
If I had to pick,
I'd personally pick Earl.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.471
I think it's very tough.

39:08.554 --> 39:09.930
{\an5}(Richard)
The shading over the
little feathers of the legs,

39:10.014 --> 39:10.931
the back, you got it.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.267
I'd stick with Earl.

39:13.350 --> 39:13.768
Earl, you're not
going anywhere.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.644
[sighs]

39:15.728 --> 39:16.979
This is between
Kito and Ryan.

39:17.063 --> 39:20.149
One of those two dudes
is going home.

39:20.232 --> 39:22.443
{\an8}Looking at these two,

39:22.526 --> 39:23.527
{\an8}there's things I don't like
about both of 'em,

39:23.611 --> 39:26.405
{\an8}but there's more things
I don't like about Ryan's.

39:26.489 --> 39:30.326
It's the speckles in the head
and that blacked out tail.

39:30.409 --> 39:31.911
(Oliver)
All three good tattoos,

39:31.994 --> 39:35.956
but an artist's got to go home
over some minute details.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.708
My pick is Ryan.

39:37.792 --> 39:38.834
Ryan.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.128
(Dave)
The judges have decided.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.963
Ryan...

39:43.047 --> 39:45.299
you do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.886
{\an5}(Chris)
Tattooing with people
yapping at you

39:48.969 --> 39:50.930
and us giving you [bleep]
about what you're doing,

39:51.013 --> 39:52.431
some people can handle
this pressure,

39:52.515 --> 39:54.475
and some people can't.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.393
It's not easy.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.770
(Dave)
Please pack your machines

39:57.853 --> 39:59.021
and close shop.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.610
{\an5}(Ryan voice-over)
You know if I didn't listen
to St. Marq,

40:04.693 --> 40:05.903
I would not be going home today.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.154
I was the one to beat,

40:07.238 --> 40:10.116
and he [bleep] sabotaged
my ass.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.659
It feels like Cain and Abel.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.077
Cain can't take the win.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.749
{\an5}(announcer)
On the next episode
of <i> Ink Master...</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:20.209
(Dave)
It's sink or swim.

40:20.292 --> 40:21.418
(Oliver)
Holy mackerel.

40:21.502 --> 40:22.753
(St. Marq)
Now I'm the lone wolf,

40:22.837 --> 40:24.088
and I'm going to take it out
on everyone here.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.757
{\an5}(Chris)
This is the way to find out
who's full of [bleep].

40:26.841 --> 40:29.426
{\an5}(Miami)
My canvas came in
with a million ideas.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.012
God blessed almighty,
what a struggle.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.431
(Big Ceeze)
If it was between you and I,

40:33.514 --> 40:35.307
they may as well just cut me
a check right now.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.852
{\an5}(Tyler)
Big Ceeze, you're [bleep]
shooting yourself in the head.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.228
{\an5}(Miami)
You know, I come here to [bleep]
prove a point,

40:39.311 --> 40:40.980
and I ain't proved [bleep].

40:41.063 --> 40:42.148
(Oliver)
You gave yourself

40:42.231 --> 40:43.190
this tough battle.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.942
I did whatever it took
to keep him in that seat.

40:45.025 --> 40:46.861
Set yourself up for greatness,
not for failure.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.195
You drop me off in the jungle,
baby.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.446
I adjust in a day.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.656
If you can't meet the challenge,

40:50.739 --> 40:52.283
you can be the best tattooer
in the world,

40:52.366 --> 40:53.492
but you're going home.
