Oh, well, if a mother knows. Right.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.130
Well, just out of curiosity,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.407
how does a secret meet-up
like that end?

12:37.880 --> 12:41.805
Huh?
With a sad but loving farewell blowjob?

12:42.440 --> 12:44.568
Look, I-- I don't know
what else to say to you.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.011
Look, I came here hoping to,

12:47.360 --> 12:49.522
I don't know,
make some kind of amends.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.166
Yeah, so when you're ready
for that, you know, let me know.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.401
How you doing?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.967
Hey, listen.
I just wanted to remind you that, um,

13:15.040 --> 13:16.451
Andre's suspension is over,

13:16.520 --> 13:18.488
so he's gonna be back in school tomorrow.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.369
I'm sure he'll be on his best behavior,

13:21.480 --> 13:24.802
but if he bothers you in any way,
just let me know, okay?

13:25.640 --> 13:26.926
All right, go grab a taco.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.567
Probably way better
than the school lunch, right?

Where the hell did you--

14:15.560 --> 14:17.767
I cannot believe Patras stood there and--

14:17.840 --> 14:19.604
- Where are you going?
- To find that prick

14:19.680 --> 14:22.365
and teach him what happens
to someone who does something like this.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.920
That prick is the father of my baby.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.290

14:37.480 --> 14:39.881
Are you kidding me, Marisa?
How the hell could you--

14:39.960 --> 14:43.885
When he was my client,
[sighs] we became involved.

14:47.560 --> 14:50.643
Does your client intend
to become involved as a father?

14:50.720 --> 14:52.324
I don't know, and I don't care.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.641
I played you this recording
so that you would finally

14:54.720 --> 14:56.609
back off this insane vendetta
that you have

14:56.680 --> 14:59.047
against Patrick Woichik,
as you promised me you would.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.646
Hey, you don't like the way
I handle my business, just look away.

15:01.720 --> 15:02.767
Okay, yeah.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.206
That's great advice, Dad.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.484
I'll just look away when you get
the father of my child murdered.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.090
I'll just look away when Patrick Woichik
puts a bullet in your head.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.081
And when my child asks what happened
to his father

15:15.280 --> 15:18.284
and his grandfather, I won't answer.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.050
I'll just look away.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.247
you are gonna do
whatever you want to do,

15:33.080 --> 15:35.048
and nothing is gonna stop you,

15:35.440 --> 15:37.761
even if it destroys your own family.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.087
[Marisa] So just go...

all right?

16:12.840 --> 16:15.411

- It's off.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.687

16:17.880 --> 16:19.405
Don't call Patrick.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.162
When you were six months old...

16:46.040 --> 16:47.644
I held you in my arms,

16:48.520 --> 16:50.841
I looked into your beautiful face,

16:52.600 --> 16:53.681
and made a vow;

16:55.040 --> 16:57.566
I will never make this person cry.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.886
And I blew it.

I am sorry, pumpkin.

- Hey.
- Hey.

You're not gonna totally blow off
grief group, are you?

17:38.200 --> 17:39.770
No, what are you talking about?

17:39.920 --> 17:42.241
In fact, I thought tomorrow,
we can go together.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.846
It was today, and you missed it.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.006
It's Thursday?

17:48.960 --> 17:50.166
Shit.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.290
All day, I-- I been thinking
it's Wednesday.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.807
Well, you know what?

17:55.080 --> 17:56.650
Maybe grief group is not something

17:56.760 --> 17:57.921
I need right now, anyway.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.731
I mean, I-- I really don't see the point.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.365
Tommy, it's not possible.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.001
What?

Tommy, you and Dion
are very different people.

18:31.520 --> 18:32.601
Yeah.

Okay, a-- after everything
T.J.'s been through,

18:36.280 --> 18:39.727

Well, since I'm being honest,

18:53.640 --> 18:55.210
there's something I need to tell you.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.607
What?

19:00.560 --> 19:01.925
It's about Oscar.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.361
Yeah?

19:04.600 --> 19:06.090
And the truth is...

19:06.320 --> 19:08.527
[soft music plays]

19:12.760 --> 19:14.842

19:24.840 --> 19:29.129
Plus, if you hadn't lied,
you and I wouldn't be able

19:29.200 --> 19:31.851
to be spending all this time together,
right?

19:33.680 --> 19:36.081
So thank you for being a...

19:36.640 --> 19:38.210

Look, maybe if you weren't
joking around so much earlier.

We'll need a third of what you owe us,

26:14.480 --> 26:15.970
starting with the next payment.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.724
Oh, come on. A third?

Yeah, a loyalty to your friend.

Tell me, what is it about Tommy Moran

26:48.080 --> 26:49.127
What?

I'm not enamored.

Yo, Mr. Moran.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.166
What do you mean it's missing?

28:56.560 --> 29:00.360
Because I'm staring at the lock box
where I keep it and it's not there.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.407
It's a cherry-handled .38.
I think the kid took it.

What, T.J.?
W-- why would he take that?
