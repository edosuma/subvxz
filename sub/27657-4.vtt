WEBVTT

00:57.125 --> 00:57.965
{\an8}Mum?

01:10.165 --> 01:11.125
{\an8}Ow!

01:15.645 --> 01:17.165
{\an8}-Oh!
-What?

01:17.925 --> 01:19.285
Where did you come from?

01:21.325 --> 01:22.325
Mildred.

01:22.405 --> 01:25.165
I asked her to transport me outside.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.445
You know what her aim's like.

01:35.765 --> 01:40.885
It is a spoon, not a whisk, Mabel Tapioca.

01:41.605 --> 01:45.805
You are not in your mother's kitchen now.

01:51.165 --> 01:53.405
Don't worry, she's like that
with everyone.

01:54.765 --> 01:57.885
The teachers at Amulet's were worse.
Believe me.

01:58.485 --> 01:59.885
Worse than Miss Hardbroom?

01:59.965 --> 02:01.125
Quiet!

02:02.125 --> 02:07.685
For tomorrow's lesson I would like you all
to bring in your own translation potions.

02:07.765 --> 02:09.884
Extra points will be awarded

02:09.965 --> 02:13.764
for each additional language
achieved with the same spell.

02:14.245 --> 02:18.205
The current record is 24.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.925
Twenty-four? Who managed that?

02:21.925 --> 02:22.765
Ethel.

02:25.525 --> 02:29.285
But I expect you will put your sister's
total to shame.

02:29.365 --> 02:32.765
Won't you, Sybil Hallow?

02:37.005 --> 02:38.205
Clarice?

02:38.285 --> 02:40.685
Ethel, can you help me
with my translation spells? I--

02:40.765 --> 02:41.605
No time.

02:41.685 --> 02:43.965
Go and ask Mildred.
I thought she was your favorite.

02:44.885 --> 02:48.205
Oh wait, I forgot,
she's a liar and a cheat.

02:52.325 --> 02:54.285
Still want to be the best witch
at Cackle's?

02:55.085 --> 02:57.125
I'll give you one more chance.

02:59.885 --> 03:01.445
Are you sure Ethel
doesn't suspect anything?

03:01.525 --> 03:04.365
Positive. I told her it was
one of your spells that had gone wrong.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.925
Very believable to be fair.

03:06.805 --> 03:09.325
She'll probably still try
and get me sacked, regardless.

03:12.565 --> 03:14.965
You'll have to teach me
how to transport myself properly.

03:16.165 --> 03:18.565
Be lovely not to have to get
the number seven bus anymore.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.605
Mum?

03:20.445 --> 03:21.725
You know this can't carry on.

03:22.525 --> 03:23.565
Why not?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.965
I don't have to give it up,
as long as I can learn to control it.

03:27.045 --> 03:29.045
Transportation spells are very
difficult.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.205
We've only just got the hang of them.

03:31.285 --> 03:32.925
Well, no time to waste then.

03:33.405 --> 03:34.805
When can we get started?

03:45.765 --> 03:48.765
You're not going to ask me
to steal for you again, are you?

03:49.925 --> 03:52.285
No, but you can help me look for clues.

03:52.685 --> 03:55.685
What makes you so sure that
Mildred and her mum are up to something?

03:55.765 --> 03:59.325
Because, Ms Hubble
was acting shifty earlier,

03:59.405 --> 04:03.485
and this lie about dropping
the wishing star was so far-fetched.

04:04.205 --> 04:06.925
Trust me, this school
will be a lot better off

04:07.005 --> 04:08.765
once we've got rid of the Hubbles.

04:10.765 --> 04:11.765
Where are you going?

04:12.925 --> 04:14.845
I admire your intellect, Ethel.

04:14.925 --> 04:16.365
But for someone who is very smart,

04:16.445 --> 04:18.565
you're prone to extreme lapses
in judgement,

04:18.644 --> 04:20.404
and I don't want to help you anymore.

04:22.084 --> 04:23.005
Ugh!

04:26.205 --> 04:27.365
Uh!

04:40.565 --> 04:41.685
What's all this then?

04:42.725 --> 04:44.805
Cackle's annual chanting contest.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.605
It's being held next week.

04:46.685 --> 04:49.565
The girls perform their own chants,
with a prize going to the winner.

04:49.645 --> 04:52.325
We used to struggle
to fill the hall.

04:52.405 --> 04:55.525
Brooms crossed the whole school
will show up this time.

04:56.085 --> 04:59.325
The outfits for the show are over here.
Prepare to be dazzled.

05:04.525 --> 05:05.525
Oh.

05:06.285 --> 05:09.245
They're a bit dull for a concert,
aren't they?

05:09.325 --> 05:10.205
Who designed these?

05:10.285 --> 05:12.085
-I'll give you three guesses.
-I did.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.405
And what would you have them wear?

05:14.485 --> 05:15.525
Glitter?

05:16.205 --> 05:18.725
I just thought
that maybe the girls could

05:18.805 --> 05:21.805
express themselves at the concert,
Miss Cackle?

05:22.085 --> 05:25.365
Perhaps, design their own outfits.
I could oversee it in class.

05:25.445 --> 05:26.485
I do not think

05:26.565 --> 05:29.925
it would be appropriate for our girls
to be gallivanting around in--

05:30.005 --> 05:31.645
Actually, Miss Hardbroom,

05:31.725 --> 05:36.045
I think this is exactly what we need
to get the students excited.

05:36.725 --> 05:40.245
I can't wait to see what you come up with,
Ms Hubble.

05:50.645 --> 05:52.245
Just imagine your dream outfit,

05:52.325 --> 05:54.325
and if you're entering
the chanting contest,

05:54.405 --> 05:56.805
then I'll help you
make your costumes for real.

05:59.005 --> 06:01.765
I preferred it when we were working on
our self-portraits.

06:01.845 --> 06:03.085
Of course you would say that.

06:03.525 --> 06:05.965
But I'm going to look amazing
when I pick up my trophy.

06:06.045 --> 06:07.765
Ms Hubble is the best.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.085
No magical incidents since yesterday.

06:11.325 --> 06:13.885
This new mission
is really keeping mum focused.

06:13.965 --> 06:14.965
Yes, for now.

06:15.045 --> 06:17.525
But you know what she needs to do
before anyone finds out.

06:17.605 --> 06:18.525
I know.

06:18.925 --> 06:20.085
But it's not that easy.

06:20.845 --> 06:22.525
Mum likes being a witch now.

06:22.605 --> 06:23.805
She doesn't want to give it up.

06:26.685 --> 06:29.885
Talk me through the idea
behind your design.

06:29.965 --> 06:31.965
The theme is tradition.

06:32.045 --> 06:35.925
Okay. I was hoping for something
a bit more exciting.

06:36.605 --> 06:39.445
Traditions exist for a reason, Ms Hubble.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.525
So that everyone knows
the natural order of things.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.805
What does and doesn't belong.

06:46.085 --> 06:50.485
Well, I can tell you where that attitude
belongs, and it's not in my classroom.

06:51.165 --> 06:52.605
Ignore her, Ms Hubble.

06:53.525 --> 06:57.405
Ethel's just upset because no-one
will sit next to her horrible hand.

06:59.565 --> 07:00.645
Ethel Hallow!

07:01.525 --> 07:02.445
Right.

07:03.085 --> 07:06.405
I have put up with a lot from you,
but you have crossed the line this time.

07:06.485 --> 07:07.485
And?

07:07.565 --> 07:09.005
What are you going to do?

07:10.325 --> 07:14.245
Oh, you'll find that I can be
very creative with my punishments.

07:16.605 --> 07:17.845
What's wrong with your arm?

07:18.205 --> 07:20.205
Oh, it's nothing, it's just...

07:29.085 --> 07:32.645
Ethel? Are you okay?
I heard you were poorly.

07:33.325 --> 07:34.165
I'm fine.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.085
What do you want?

07:40.125 --> 07:44.685
I can't get my translation spell to work
and I have to beat your record.

07:46.165 --> 07:47.205
Can you help me?

07:47.285 --> 07:48.485
Seriously?

07:48.565 --> 07:50.445
I'm the laughing stock of the school,

07:51.085 --> 07:53.005
and you want me to help you

07:53.085 --> 07:54.845
beat my own record?

07:56.765 --> 07:57.605
Out!

07:58.925 --> 08:00.685
What happened to your hand?

08:01.325 --> 08:04.405
Ms Hubble threatened
to punish me creatively.

08:05.525 --> 08:07.805
I think somehow
she put Mildred up to this.

08:08.685 --> 08:10.165
Now I'm going to prove it.

08:17.485 --> 08:18.725
What do you think of the color?

08:18.805 --> 08:20.485
How did you make it so quickly?

08:20.565 --> 08:22.165
Do you even have a sewing machine?

08:24.325 --> 08:25.205
Tell me you didn't.

08:25.285 --> 08:26.805
I just used a few little spells.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.845
I found them in here, look.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.565
<i>Miss Stitches Magical Fashion Fixes</i>,
<i>Volume One.</i>

08:33.684 --> 08:34.565
You're not mad, are you?

08:35.284 --> 08:37.645
Mum, I should never have made you
into a witch.

08:38.525 --> 08:40.205
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.

08:40.405 --> 08:42.205
You can't control your magic.

08:42.284 --> 08:43.885
Well, could you three years ago?

08:44.445 --> 08:46.765
You've given me the most wonderful gift.

08:47.285 --> 08:49.605
There's no limit to my creativity now.

08:49.685 --> 08:51.805
Just give me a chance to learn the ropes,
yeah?

09:00.605 --> 09:02.485
Hide among my enemies,

09:02.565 --> 09:04.485
become my unseen eye,

09:04.565 --> 09:07.205
snoop out their greatest secrets,

09:07.285 --> 09:09.325
serve me, loyal spy.

09:12.045 --> 09:13.765
Who would you like me to spy on?

09:16.805 --> 09:19.605
Millie, why are you wearing a tent?

09:20.045 --> 09:20.925
It's a dress.

09:21.005 --> 09:22.285
I can fix the size.

09:27.205 --> 09:30.005
"What is big, turn it small.

09:31.325 --> 09:35.085
Make this size fit one and all."

09:39.605 --> 09:40.525
Oh, no!

09:41.165 --> 09:42.805
Oh, love, I'm so sorry.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.445
Don't you dare laugh.

09:45.965 --> 09:47.765
It's not very big of us.

09:48.725 --> 09:50.765
Just put me back to normal, please.

09:50.845 --> 09:52.325
We need the reversal spell.

09:52.405 --> 09:53.245
Yes, yes, uh...

09:53.325 --> 09:55.085
I think it's in volume two.

09:56.245 --> 09:57.405
No! Argh!

09:58.565 --> 09:59.605
I don't know what went wrong.

09:59.685 --> 10:01.765
I said the words perfectly.

10:01.845 --> 10:04.805
There's more to spells than saying words.
It's about your intent too.

10:04.885 --> 10:07.645
You have to be incredibly focused
or they can go badly wrong.

10:07.725 --> 10:08.925
Oh, thanks, Maud.

10:09.005 --> 10:10.685
I'll bear that in mind for next time.

10:10.765 --> 10:13.325
I don't think the book's in here
after all.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.405
Maybe it's in my room.

10:20.365 --> 10:21.685
What now?

10:24.485 --> 10:27.285
We ran out of knotweed
for our translation potions.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.085
Can we borrow some of yours?

10:29.645 --> 10:31.565
Actually, yes, come in.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.085
I want to show you all something.

10:33.965 --> 10:35.445
You brought your portrait
to life.

10:35.525 --> 10:36.885
Would no-one else talk to you?

10:39.085 --> 10:41.365
Go ahead. You can tell them too.

10:42.605 --> 10:46.205
Maud Spellbody and Julie Hubble
came running into the art room.

10:51.205 --> 10:53.765
I think I put too much in. Sorry.

10:56.325 --> 10:57.325
Please continue.

10:58.525 --> 11:02.405
<i> Maud e Julie stavano</i>
<i>cercando un libro degli incantesimi.</i>

11:02.485 --> 11:05.365
<i>Julie ha detto che aveva lanciato</i>
<i>un incantesimo</i>

11:05.445 --> 11:08.085
<i>e non ha capito come fosse andata male.</i>

11:08.725 --> 11:10.525
You made her Italian!

11:10.605 --> 11:11.685
I didn't mean to!

11:11.765 --> 11:13.925
Do you have any idea what you've done?

11:14.005 --> 11:14.965
Go to your room!

11:15.045 --> 11:16.325
-But--
-Now!

11:20.525 --> 11:21.885
Where do you think you two are going?

11:21.965 --> 11:23.965
I need you to help me
fix this.

11:37.685 --> 11:39.205
What is all this?

11:43.925 --> 11:45.125
It cannot be!

11:51.445 --> 11:53.805
Ms Hubble, maybe I should
cast the spell this time?

11:53.885 --> 11:55.205
Don't be silly, I can fix it.

11:55.285 --> 11:57.645
Please, Mum,
we can't go on like this.

11:58.165 --> 11:59.765
You have to give up your magic.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.205
We'll talk about that in a minute.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.605
Now, I've found the spell.

12:02.965 --> 12:04.285
Right.

12:04.365 --> 12:08.485
"With this spell, I shall undo,
the shrinking that was done to you."

12:08.565 --> 12:10.805
"With my will and with my might,

12:10.885 --> 12:14.285
I free you from this doll-sized plight."

12:21.725 --> 12:23.445
At least it can't get any worse.

12:26.445 --> 12:27.285
Star!

12:47.685 --> 12:48.725
Who's there?

12:52.565 --> 12:53.405
No.

12:54.005 --> 12:56.525
No, no, please, no!

12:58.605 --> 13:02.445
Ethel was in there, just before
the swamp troll came out of her room.

13:02.525 --> 13:04.165
You must be mistaken, Beatrice.

13:04.245 --> 13:06.925
There's no such thing as a swamp troll.

13:07.005 --> 13:10.565
I do not believe in folk tales either,
Miss Cackle,

13:10.645 --> 13:12.205
but that creature was real.

13:12.685 --> 13:16.205
Which is why I sent it out into the forest
before it could cause any more damage.

13:16.285 --> 13:19.205
Where's Ethel?
I heard she went missing.

13:20.085 --> 13:21.965
They think the troll kidnapped her.

13:22.645 --> 13:23.685
The...

13:23.765 --> 13:25.005
The what?

13:25.085 --> 13:26.685
Try not to worry, Sybil.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.285
I've organized a search party.

13:28.365 --> 13:29.685
In the meantime,

13:29.765 --> 13:32.245
do not imagine this is an excuse for you

13:32.325 --> 13:35.405
not to prepare for your potions test
this afternoon.

13:35.485 --> 13:37.165
But, Miss Hardbroom!

13:37.245 --> 13:39.765
She's right, Sybil.
Worrying won't do you any good.

13:40.165 --> 13:42.525
Let us take care of that for you.

13:48.525 --> 13:52.645
We need to secure the grounds.
I suspect this creature will be back.

13:52.725 --> 13:53.845
But this time...

13:54.925 --> 13:56.005
we'll be waiting.

14:11.605 --> 14:12.725
Star!

14:23.805 --> 14:24.725
Star!

14:25.485 --> 14:26.325
Star?

14:31.405 --> 14:35.085
A chanting contest?
That really is music to my ears.

14:35.525 --> 14:37.845
As if you'd have a chance.
You can't sing a note.

14:38.485 --> 14:39.965
Why-- what are you plotting?

14:40.605 --> 14:44.005
Come on, Mum.
You know I can't resist a large crowd.

14:44.765 --> 14:46.525
Sorry I'm late, Miss Tapioca.

14:46.605 --> 14:48.085
Is it true what I've heard?

14:48.165 --> 14:50.605
Is there really a swamp troll at Cackle's?

14:50.685 --> 14:52.365
Yeah. I saw it.

14:52.445 --> 14:53.845
I didn't think they were real.

14:54.525 --> 14:57.365
Oh, I used to love that old folk tale.

14:57.445 --> 15:00.605
The one about the witch who cast
too many spells in anger

15:00.685 --> 15:02.605
and turned into a hideous troll.

15:02.885 --> 15:06.325
And the only way she could undo the curse
was with an act of true kindness.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.525
Yeah, my dad told me that one as well.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.085
<i> Casting too many spells</i>
<i>in anger?</i>

15:16.005 --> 15:17.965
<i>Is that what happened to me?</i>

15:20.965 --> 15:22.965
We've been walking around in circles.

15:24.045 --> 15:25.445
I don't know what happened.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.685
My locating spell should have worked,
but all it did was take us outside.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.245
I couldn't see Star anywhere.

15:30.325 --> 15:32.165
We need to think of something else
to find Mildred,

15:32.245 --> 15:33.965
before anyone realizes she's gone.

15:35.005 --> 15:36.485
Or that she's a doll?

15:36.565 --> 15:37.445
I'm just saying.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.285
Knew Mildred was up to something.

15:42.965 --> 15:46.645
And if it only takes an act of kindness
to undo this curse,

15:47.085 --> 15:52.525
then I'm sure showing Miss Cackle
the truth will be a very kind thing to do.

15:54.045 --> 15:56.645
Hubble bubble, toil and trouble,

15:57.885 --> 16:00.285
take us both to Mildred Hubble.

16:25.925 --> 16:27.565
I don't think
Ethel's been kidnapped.

16:27.645 --> 16:30.245
If you ask me,
she's doing all of this for attention.

16:30.845 --> 16:33.005
It wouldn't surprise me
if she's gone after the troll herself,

16:33.085 --> 16:34.405
just to look like some hero.

16:35.165 --> 16:39.005
Personally, I'd rather take my chances
with a troll than with an angry Ethel.

16:55.285 --> 16:56.605
Clarice!

16:56.965 --> 16:58.645
Clarice, shut up, it's me.

17:01.965 --> 17:04.204
You can't understand me, can you?

17:11.045 --> 17:12.724
Uh! Stay where you are.

17:19.124 --> 17:21.045
Where's it gone?

17:21.124 --> 17:23.244
- How can we have lost it?
- I don't know.

17:30.725 --> 17:32.685
I haven't had much time to work on these.

17:32.765 --> 17:35.925
So far I've managed to translate French
into French-Canadian.

17:36.005 --> 17:36.885
Do you think that counts?

17:36.965 --> 17:39.325
I don't know how
I'm supposed to concentrate.

17:39.405 --> 17:41.085
I should be out there looking for Ethel.

17:41.965 --> 17:43.325
Even after what she did to you?

17:43.845 --> 17:46.005
I've been especially horrid
to her this term too.

17:46.445 --> 17:49.445
When we were younger,
Ethel would always look after me.

17:50.325 --> 17:53.125
When I was upset, I would run and tell her

17:53.205 --> 17:55.005
and she would make everything okay.

17:56.245 --> 17:57.885
I know she's changed a bit lately,

17:57.965 --> 17:59.365
but she's still my sister

17:59.445 --> 18:01.605
and I don't want anything bad
to happen to her.

18:01.925 --> 18:06.005
Look, you can't do a lot about Ethel,
but you can pass this potion test.

18:07.005 --> 18:08.565
I just wish Ethel was here.

18:08.645 --> 18:10.005
She would know what to do.

18:23.205 --> 18:24.725
I am here, Sybil.

18:25.685 --> 18:26.725
Don't worry.

18:36.485 --> 18:39.365
Star! Where have you been? Bad boy.

18:44.045 --> 18:47.365
No Mildred. Just dirt and drool.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.245
Oh, my little girl.

18:50.325 --> 18:53.365
Maybe we should just face the music
and tell Miss Cackle the truth?

18:53.445 --> 18:56.685
You'd be confessing to breaking the code.
Mildred will be expelled.

18:56.765 --> 18:57.765
Let's split up again.

19:00.845 --> 19:02.365
Oh, I should have never taken this job.

19:02.445 --> 19:03.885
The job isn't the problem, Ms Hubble.

19:03.965 --> 19:05.245
It's the magic.

19:23.525 --> 19:25.285
Help! Troll!

19:30.325 --> 19:31.245
Sybil.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.005
"Translation potions for Sybil"?

19:51.765 --> 19:54.245
Who... are...

19:58.125 --> 19:58.965
you?

19:59.045 --> 20:00.765
You are late.

20:01.805 --> 20:04.125
And it is time for your test.

20:04.205 --> 20:08.405
Let us see if you can beat
your sister's record.

20:21.485 --> 20:22.525
I can't see it.

20:22.605 --> 20:23.965
Ah! Oh!

20:24.045 --> 20:25.885
It's over here!

20:31.165 --> 20:33.245
I'm right behind it!

20:40.125 --> 20:45.525
<i>A dwi'n meddwl bod hyn</i>
<i>yn Gymraeg?</i>

20:46.685 --> 20:48.405
Twenty-five!

20:48.485 --> 20:50.645
A new school record.

20:53.525 --> 20:54.605
Congratulations.

20:56.085 --> 20:59.125
The troll's been spotted.
It's headed towards the Great Hall.

20:59.885 --> 21:00.925
Stay where you are everyone.

21:01.605 --> 21:03.365
This will all be over soon.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.285
Come on. We have to help the troll.

21:08.965 --> 21:09.845
What?

21:15.325 --> 21:17.165
There's no need
to be alarmed.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.605
We simply want to know what you've done
with Ethel Hallow.

21:24.045 --> 21:27.605
Fail to cooperate
and I will turn you into a toad.

21:28.165 --> 21:30.925
There are worse things in my opinion.

21:31.005 --> 21:31.885
Please!

21:32.765 --> 21:33.605
Stop!

21:34.605 --> 21:35.725
Don't hurt the troll.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.245
I don't think it's dangerous.

21:41.045 --> 21:45.885
It helped me, and it was friendly
with Nightstar and Sparkle.

21:50.845 --> 21:53.885
It's too late,
they're not going to believe you.

21:53.965 --> 21:54.885
They might.

21:56.725 --> 21:58.005
I can understand you.

21:59.365 --> 22:00.725
The translation potion.

22:01.965 --> 22:03.525
Sybil, it's me!

22:03.605 --> 22:04.925
It's, it's Ethel.

22:05.005 --> 22:06.005
I'm Ethel!

22:08.485 --> 22:09.605
What is it saying?

22:10.565 --> 22:12.885
It says it's Ethel.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.085
Careful, Sybil.

22:14.165 --> 22:15.245
It might be a trick.

22:15.325 --> 22:17.765
We can't take any chances with this thing.

22:23.285 --> 22:24.405
Sybil, I'm sorry.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.885
I should have helped you with your potion,
and I shouldn't have snapped at you.

22:46.405 --> 22:47.885
Mildred Hubble.

23:00.405 --> 23:02.325
You're going to have to cope
without me from now on.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.725
But remember...

23:11.205 --> 23:14.285
you are braver and smarter
than you think you are.

23:15.685 --> 23:16.685
How do you know?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.285
You're talking to a troll for one thing.

23:26.925 --> 23:29.005
Only a Hallow would be
brave enough to do that.

23:31.365 --> 23:32.245
Ethel?

23:45.365 --> 23:46.405
What?

23:47.205 --> 23:49.405
At least I only look like a troll
on a bad day.

23:52.525 --> 23:54.485
You lot are stuck like that all the time.

24:01.365 --> 24:03.725
It's not been your year, has it, Ethel?

24:05.005 --> 24:08.085
Why don't we draw a line under things.

24:08.165 --> 24:09.725
Consider this a fresh start.

24:10.845 --> 24:13.245
Yes, Miss Cackle. Thank you.

24:18.645 --> 24:22.445
Interesting looking toy we have here,
Ms Hubble,

24:22.525 --> 24:24.725
bearing a striking resemblance
to your daughter,

24:24.805 --> 24:27.125
who is conspicuous by her absence.

24:28.245 --> 24:33.085
Undo the curse upon this toy,
reveal to me your secret ploy.

24:33.165 --> 24:35.565
With my will, with my might,

24:35.645 --> 24:40.125
return now to your own true height.

24:42.765 --> 24:43.605
Miss Hardbroom.

24:45.285 --> 24:46.125
Mum.

24:47.325 --> 24:48.365
Hi.

24:48.445 --> 24:52.045
Who is responsible for this?

24:53.085 --> 24:54.405
I, um--

24:54.485 --> 24:57.565
No, it was me. Um, yeah.

24:57.645 --> 24:59.925
Mum was modelling this dress on me,
but it was too big,

25:00.005 --> 25:04.045
so I tried to fix it with magic,
but it didn't work.

25:04.445 --> 25:05.285
Sorry.

25:06.485 --> 25:11.645
I knew allowing your fashion experiments
would be a grave mistake.

25:12.045 --> 25:14.685
As deputy head,
I am dutybound to punish

25:14.765 --> 25:17.645
student... and staff.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.525
Actually, Miss Hardbroom,
it was my spell that went wrong.

25:20.605 --> 25:22.405
Mildred was just covering for me.

25:23.085 --> 25:25.165
Actually, it was my spell, Miss Hardbroom.

25:25.245 --> 25:27.125
You should punish me not Ms Hubble.

25:27.205 --> 25:28.965
She's the best art teacher ever.

25:29.045 --> 25:33.205
Anyone else care to confess?

25:35.605 --> 25:36.885
-Me.
-Me.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.405
-Me.
-Me.

25:39.565 --> 25:42.005
No thanks. I'll pass.

25:45.005 --> 25:48.885
Popularity will not save you every time.

26:04.765 --> 26:06.885
Are you sure you want
to give up your magic?

26:07.725 --> 26:09.405
It has to be your choice.

26:09.485 --> 26:10.365
I'm sure.

26:11.285 --> 26:14.285
I nearly lost you today,
and nothing's worth that.

26:15.805 --> 26:18.365
I'll just stick to being
the best art teacher ever.

26:19.205 --> 26:20.245
Ready?

26:22.045 --> 26:23.365
Here's the reversal spell.

26:23.845 --> 26:25.885
And remember, concentrate.

26:31.845 --> 26:35.005
"Take away this precious gift,

26:35.885 --> 26:39.045
the magic which I cast adrift.

26:39.405 --> 26:42.045
I freely end my enchanted hours

26:42.925 --> 26:47.085
and relinquish now my witching powers."

26:57.285 --> 27:01.645
Haven't you got lantern duty to do?
Come on. I didn't raise a slacker.

27:02.645 --> 27:03.685
How do you feel?

27:03.765 --> 27:07.885
Oh, you know, just like your ordinary,
boring old mum again.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.365
Normal as can be.
