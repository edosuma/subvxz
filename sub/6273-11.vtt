00:00.066 --> 00:02.434
Libby:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:02.436 --> 00:02.968
Herb spleeb.

00:02.970 --> 00:05.571
"when life kicks
you to the kerb,
call herb."

00:05.573 --> 00:06.672
Herb's a divorce lawyer.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.907
Very interested
in renting office space.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.309
I'm offering
you an opportunity

00:10.311 --> 00:13.312
To participate in the work.
As a subject.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.115
I can bring men
back to life.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.250
I was wondering
if you could use my help.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.518
I would like
to contribute.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.320
I have secondary
impotence.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.088
I can function
when I'm by myself.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.457
It's when
I'm with a partner...

00:25.459 --> 00:26.291
I'm good at this job.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.761
I know how to make women
feel good about themselves.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.095
So do that for me.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.430
Make me feel good.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.365
Mr. Tally is a partner

00:33.367 --> 00:36.068
At williams and kulick
public relations.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.770
The two of you come on,

00:37.772 --> 00:39.304
Both scientists
and yet looking

00:39.306 --> 00:41.640
Like the nice couple
next door,

00:41.642 --> 00:43.809
And suddenly I trust you.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.411
Us on tv?

00:45.413 --> 00:46.412
Our father was a monster.

00:46.414 --> 00:50.349
But our monster
was a sick alcoholic.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.984
You've always been weak.

00:51.986 --> 00:55.154
A gutless, pathetic man.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.789
(both grunting)

00:56.791 --> 00:58.357
(coughing)

01:03.163 --> 01:05.831
(theme music playing)

01:50.310 --> 01:52.978
Virginia:
It's healing nicely.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.446
Makeup will cover that.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.747
Makeup?

01:55.749 --> 01:58.050
I'm not gonna walk around
wearing makeup.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.352
No, for the shoot
tomorrow.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.188
Cover it, so you can't
see it on camera.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.794
Have you spoken to him since?

02:08.796 --> 02:09.795
Your brother?

02:09.797 --> 02:12.197
I... I wrote him.

02:12.199 --> 02:12.898
Wrote?

02:12.900 --> 02:16.301
I intend
to write to him.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.537
He left town,
didn't I tell you?

02:18.539 --> 02:21.907
He and pauline
went back to kansas city.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.743
No, you didn't
mention that.

02:25.211 --> 02:28.747
I'm going to make
it right with him.

02:29.782 --> 02:33.418
Do you think
that's what made
the difference that night?

02:33.420 --> 02:34.119
You were so...

02:34.121 --> 02:38.390
Everything.
Upset, angry, repentant.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.226
That you could feel.
I mean, really feel...

02:41.228 --> 02:44.897
You were so charged up,
blood pumping and...

02:44.899 --> 02:46.665
Virginia, please.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.569
Can we not analyze it?

02:50.637 --> 02:55.607
Yes. Yes, of course.
We don't have
to talk at all.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.743
Is that what you'd like?

02:57.844 --> 03:02.247
I'd like you to tell me
how it was the other night.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.216
For you.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.752
To see you hurt like that,
you mean?

03:06.754 --> 03:10.689
No, what happened
after that.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.560
The sex.

03:16.663 --> 03:18.897
It was good.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.601
Tell me.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.740
It was very good.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.277
How did I...

03:32.478 --> 03:35.714
How did I feel
inside you?

03:38.284 --> 03:40.586
Hard.
(grunts)

03:54.601 --> 03:56.702
It's all right, bill.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.937
It'll happen
next time.
How do you know?

03:58.939 --> 04:00.505
Because it happened before.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.108
It wasn't the beginning
of an upward trend.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.844
It was a blip.
An anomaly.
Bill.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.614
(sighs)

04:08.616 --> 04:11.617
Bill, it's all right.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.953
Really. It's all...

04:17.423 --> 04:18.757
(sighs)

04:38.811 --> 04:40.345
(sighs)

05:17.417 --> 05:20.052
She's got you
wrapped around her finger.

05:20.054 --> 05:20.919
She said she was nervous

05:20.921 --> 05:24.089
About taking her
eiffel tower on the bus.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.424
Daddy.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.025
(gasps) wow!

05:27.027 --> 05:29.561
Would you look
at that masterpiece?

05:29.563 --> 05:32.564
Your french presentation's
today, bug?

05:32.566 --> 05:34.766
I told you. Twice.

05:34.934 --> 05:35.834
(sighs)
I'm so sorry, tessy.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.004
I've had a lot on my mind.
(george chuckles)

05:39.006 --> 05:41.073
Do you have my barrette?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.708
Beret.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.942
And I sure do,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.010
Audrey picked it out.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.479
I'll trade you.
Go try it on in the car.

05:47.481 --> 05:50.215
Have a good day, sweetie.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.350
(tessa singing)

05:51.352 --> 05:54.586
Listen, if I could
grab you for a minute...

05:54.588 --> 05:56.355
(henry groaning)

05:56.357 --> 05:57.856
You got to make her stop

05:57.858 --> 05:59.324
With that stupid song, dad.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.693
Help me out, sport,
put that in the back seat.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.395
I need a word
with your mom.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.431
If you'll let me
start the engine?

06:06.433 --> 06:08.333
(chuckles)

06:11.337 --> 06:12.771
Have a good day, henry.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.874
He told me
you let him drive on Sunday.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.008
It was in a parking lot.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.877
No. I wasn't going
to scold you.

06:18.879 --> 06:23.181
I think it's nice you're
spending so much time
with them.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.152
It's audrey's doing.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.019
She's really encouraged me.

06:28.021 --> 06:33.658
Well, please be sure
to tell your wife
how grateful I am to her.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.359
(car horn honking)

06:34.361 --> 06:37.429
Better go.
The natives are
getting restless.

06:37.431 --> 06:41.700
Actually, gini,
if you have a sec...
I don't.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.035
Cbs is sending
a camera crew

06:44.037 --> 06:45.837
To interview bill
and me today,

06:45.839 --> 06:46.605
So we can talk later,

06:46.607 --> 06:50.909
When I drop the kids
off at your place
this weekend?

06:51.043 --> 06:52.544
(sighs)

06:52.546 --> 06:55.447
So, what made you
choose keys?

06:55.449 --> 06:58.817
Why not a magic shop
or a watch repair
or something?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.452
It's a business
with a lot of
foot traffic.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.787
Everyone needs keys,
right?
Yeah.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.889
And on average,
it takes four minutes
to make one,

07:03.891 --> 07:05.257
Which is pretty much
the time it takes

07:05.259 --> 07:07.793
To put down ten bucks
on the third race
at fairmont park.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.595
(laughs)
cbs.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.496
Cbs is here?

07:11.498 --> 07:14.199
They're filming
a piece today.

07:14.400 --> 07:14.966
On what?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.001
Don't get your knickers
in a knot.

07:16.003 --> 07:20.405
They're way more
interested in nookie
than in a bookie.

07:20.407 --> 07:22.808
That rhymes.
(chuckles)

07:25.945 --> 07:27.045
How's it going?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.046
That's quite
a lighting package.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.781
I'm not really sure
the building's
electrical system's

07:29.783 --> 07:30.916
Has got the juice
to support it.

07:30.918 --> 07:34.119
We got our own generator.
It's downstairs.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.924
They picked up
a local crew
from the cbs affiliate.

07:38.926 --> 07:41.960
Roger's bringing
his own cameraman
from new york.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.762
Oh, we were hoping...

07:43.764 --> 07:46.798
Is there
a role for lester
in all of this?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.233
Absolutely. Student.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.702
He's going to be learning
from some real pros.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.638
Roger corwin came up
the ranks at the network,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.006
Worked with
all the big guns.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.008
He really knows
what he's doing.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.510
I'm not sure
I can say the same.

07:58.512 --> 08:03.248
I'm sure that you've
had to explain the work
dozens of times before.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.851
Yes, my colleagues
in the medical profession

08:05.853 --> 08:08.487
Who have
a basic understanding
of the science.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.388
Bill, to be fair,
also to members
of the board,

08:10.390 --> 08:12.424
Who needed things
spelled out
in layman's terms.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.794
That was your forte,
not mine.
We did it together.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.330
Well, the task here
is much the same,

08:18.332 --> 08:20.398
Capture the layman's
interest.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.399
You have to be
personable enough

08:21.401 --> 08:25.270
To make the audience
want to invite you
into their home.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.137
Like fuller brush men.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.974
They're not the only ones
who know that a smile

08:28.976 --> 08:32.244
And some direct eye contact
make all the difference.

08:32.246 --> 08:35.981
Ask anybody
who heard the first debate
on the radio,

08:35.983 --> 08:39.117
And they'll tell you
nixon took it on substance.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.986
But the polls of
television viewers

08:40.988 --> 08:43.421
Shows that kennedy
came out ahead.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.657
Why? Because of
that smile,

08:45.659 --> 08:47.826
That confidence,
that twinkle in his eye.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.196
Wouldn't you rather
spend the next four years
looking at him

08:51.198 --> 08:54.699
Than some sweaty dick nix...

08:55.034 --> 08:56.968
What is that on your cheek?

08:56.970 --> 09:00.672
Oh, I got into
a scrape.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.941
Are you
wearing concealer?
Um...

09:02.943 --> 09:07.445
Okay, never mind.
We'll have the makeup man
take a look at it later.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.514
And may I ask...

09:10.182 --> 09:15.153
Would you be open
to wearing a different tie?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.489
What's wrong
with this one?

09:17.491 --> 09:18.757
Bill always wears
a bow tie.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.958
It's not
a fashion choice.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.593
It's a matter
of practicality,

09:21.595 --> 09:23.762
So it stays out of the way
during exams.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.462
Shep: Well, of course.

09:24.464 --> 09:28.033
But you're not performing
any exams today, are you?

09:28.035 --> 09:30.435
I just wonder
if a straight tie

09:30.437 --> 09:35.473
Might look a little less,
uh...Academic.

09:36.709 --> 09:40.045
I could see if libby
would bring one by.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.547
Bill's wife.

09:42.549 --> 09:43.214
Oh, yes, of course.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.918
And that's a great plan
getting her on camera
as well.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.353
Viewers willl be
more receptive

09:48.355 --> 09:49.754
To the sexual nature
of the work

09:49.756 --> 09:52.457
If they understand
that it was conducted
by a doctor

09:52.459 --> 09:55.660
Who's also
a real family man.

09:55.662 --> 09:56.761
Uh... Oh!

09:56.763 --> 09:58.196
There's roger.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.898
Excuse me.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.805
I am not a salesman.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.673
(sighs)

10:11.744 --> 10:14.245
Woman: Good morning, doctor.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.748
Jefferson city
was a bust.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.450
Twenty-six women
showed up.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.785
I've seen more fat
in a can of pork
and beans.

10:20.787 --> 10:24.422
They took my last brochure,
so I'm here to load up.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.358
The king is dying.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.059
Long live the queen?

10:28.861 --> 10:30.061
The king of hollywood.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.298
Clark gable had
a heart attack yesterday.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.966
Changing a goddamn tire.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.502
What was clark gable doing
changing his own tire?

10:37.504 --> 10:42.440
Because we're not talking
some namby-pamby cary grant.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.642
He's gable.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.745
He's got a set of balls
between his legs,

10:46.747 --> 10:48.380
Not a strip of goose fat.

10:48.382 --> 10:49.948
(chuckles)

10:50.483 --> 10:53.051
I was 22 when I saw
<i>gone with the wind.</i>

10:53.053 --> 10:56.121
Ended up going back
the next day and the next,

10:56.123 --> 10:57.689
Then twice a week later.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.424
Me and every other girl
in town.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.227
(scoffs)
gable. What was it?
The mustache?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.862
Mustaches don't
look good...

11:03.864 --> 11:06.865
It was the scene
on the staircase,

11:06.867 --> 11:09.901
Where rhett carries scarlett
up to bed,

11:09.903 --> 11:12.103
Against her will?

11:12.405 --> 11:12.904
Never saw it.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.007
You've never seen
<i>gone with the wind?</i>

11:16.009 --> 11:17.275
"this is one night, scarlett,

11:17.277 --> 11:20.145
"you're not turning me
out of your bed."

11:20.147 --> 11:20.545
(scoffs)

11:20.547 --> 11:24.683
He wanted her so much
that he just took her.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.952
God! So sexy.

11:27.954 --> 11:28.586
Yeah.

11:28.588 --> 11:29.988
And every girl
in that theater...

11:29.990 --> 11:31.990
Well, we watched it
over and over,

11:31.992 --> 11:34.626
Trying to get every detail
to fix in our brains

11:34.628 --> 11:38.596
Because we
instinctively knew

11:38.598 --> 11:39.364
That was the fantasy

11:39.366 --> 11:43.334
That was gonna carry us
through many lonely nights.

11:43.336 --> 11:46.905
You want to get
carried up a staircase?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.674
For a guy
who dips his wick
as much as you do,

11:49.676 --> 11:52.644
You really
don't get women at all.

11:52.646 --> 11:54.446
Um... (chuckles)

11:54.448 --> 11:57.716
I think there may be
a couple dozen
satisfied ladies out there

11:57.718 --> 12:03.321
Who would say that
I am every bit a real man
as your gable.

12:03.989 --> 12:07.358
How many pairs of slippers
you own?

12:07.360 --> 12:08.460
Two.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.929
That'll be all, ladies.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.765
You don't think
I'm a man's man?

12:14.600 --> 12:17.769
I'd be interested
in seeing you prove it.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.905
Um...

12:21.907 --> 12:23.775
Jeez, flo...

12:23.909 --> 12:25.410
I got an early morning,

12:25.412 --> 12:29.147
And you and I did it
two times last week.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.784
Tonight, you're going
to enter my house
uninvited,

12:32.786 --> 12:35.120
And over my strenuous
objections,

12:35.122 --> 12:38.523
You're going to have
your way with me.

12:39.191 --> 12:40.458
You want me to break in?

12:40.460 --> 12:43.828
You couldn't maybe
leave the door open?

12:44.764 --> 12:48.666
I'm just saying,
it would be easier.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.872
Okay, that's about it.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.441
That's good.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.678
Now, try and
reformulate the question
in your answers.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.147
So, for example,
if I say,

13:02.149 --> 13:04.649
"what initially led you
to this work, dr. Masters?"

13:04.651 --> 13:07.485
You'd say,
"what initially led me
to this work was..."

13:07.487 --> 13:08.419
That way,
in the final piece

13:08.421 --> 13:09.988
You won't have
to listen to me
off-camera,

13:09.990 --> 13:11.623
Feeding you
all the questions.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.090
Got it?

13:12.092 --> 13:13.958
What initially led me
to this work was...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.727
Not now...
Not now, dr. Masters.

13:15.729 --> 13:16.628
We're still setting up
some lights,

13:16.630 --> 13:18.396
And we have to adjust
some sound levels.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.965
And I understand
we're waiting on a tie.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.468
Do we have that tie?

13:23.736 --> 13:25.503
Anyone?

13:26.972 --> 13:30.175
(indistinct conversation)

13:30.709 --> 13:32.277
You heard?

13:32.511 --> 13:33.344
So sad.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.013
I heard
he may not make it.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.381
Who said
he's not gonna make it?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.082
I just heard it
on the radio coming in.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.119
Did something
happen to him
after the arrest?

13:41.121 --> 13:42.320
Clark gable was arrested?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.356
Martin luther king
was arrested down
at atlanta yesterday,

13:45.358 --> 13:47.258
At a sit-in,
at a lunch counter,

13:47.260 --> 13:48.526
Along with 52 other people.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.728
I didn't realize.
That's terrible.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.063
Yeah, it's going
to be busy today.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.966
Lots of people calling
to find out what we know.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.467
You coming?

13:56.469 --> 13:57.168
I can't today.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.805
I have to do
something upstairs,
for my husband.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.507
I'm sorry.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.848
Roger:
Okay, why don't we begin
by you telling us

14:09.850 --> 14:12.116
How you two first met?

14:12.718 --> 14:13.418
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.119
Glenn, I think we're
going to want to go

14:15.121 --> 14:17.522
A smidge tighter
on the day.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.358
Dr. Masters and I met
when he was on the faculty

14:20.360 --> 14:24.262
Of washington university
school of medicine.

14:26.398 --> 14:31.002
And I was working
at the hospital
as a secretary.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.706
Uh, it's okay if
you want to smile,
dr. Masters.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.643
Dr. Masters was then
in the early stages

14:38.645 --> 14:42.213
Of observing
subjects engaged
in sexual behavior,

14:42.215 --> 14:45.149
Monitoring their
physical responses,

14:45.151 --> 14:46.117
And he felt

14:46.119 --> 14:50.321
The process of interviewing
potential participants

14:50.323 --> 14:52.090
Might be well served

14:52.092 --> 14:55.894
By having a woman
working alongside of him.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.429
Isn't that right, bill?

14:59.531 --> 15:01.900
Okay, when you say
"sexual behavior,"

15:01.902 --> 15:02.734
What exactly do you mean?

15:02.736 --> 15:06.938
And I think we should
have dr. Masters
field this one.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.009
Well, masturbation,
for one.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.444
Can't say "masturbation".

15:13.512 --> 15:14.879
Auto-manipulation, then.
Mmm-mmm.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.948
I think we want
to leave out anything

15:16.950 --> 15:20.218
That suggests
solo behavior.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.388
So, ulysses is a dildo?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.389
What did you think?

15:24.391 --> 15:26.257
Our females subjects
were having intercourse

15:26.259 --> 15:28.526
With a greek leader
in the trojan war?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.694
Cbs doesn't like dildos.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.896
Cbs doesn't have
to use a dildo.

15:31.898 --> 15:35.466
But dr. Masters
and mrs. Johnson's
participants did.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.000
Do.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.437
So, all of this is footage
of women using dildos?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.072
A significant portion
of it.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.707
It's not like we were
shooting footage

15:42.709 --> 15:45.877
To promote hand washing
or good oral hygiene.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.245
Frankly, I don't know
how you propose

15:47.247 --> 15:49.280
We cut together
an overview of their work,

15:49.282 --> 15:50.381
Without the suggestion...

15:50.383 --> 15:51.916
Actually,
I wasn't proposing

15:51.918 --> 15:53.584
You and I do
anything together.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.086
Roger:
In addition to individuals,

15:55.088 --> 15:57.789
Uh, you also observed
married couples

15:57.791 --> 16:00.058
Engaging in
physical relations,
didn't you?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.492
They weren't
always married.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.528
Well, often they were,
remember?

16:03.530 --> 16:04.429
Roger:
Look, if you say "couples",

16:04.431 --> 16:06.965
Then the natural assumption
is that they were married.

16:06.967 --> 16:07.865
And what exactly
were you doing

16:07.867 --> 16:10.568
During these sessions
with these couples?

16:11.370 --> 16:12.403
During these sessions,

16:12.405 --> 16:16.274
We monitored and
tracked all changes

16:16.276 --> 16:17.875
In both subjects' bodies,

16:17.877 --> 16:19.310
And in so doing,

16:19.312 --> 16:22.413
We were able
to identify four stages

16:22.415 --> 16:24.482
Of sexual response.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.551
Bill.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.454
(bill clears throat)

16:29.456 --> 16:31.122
Arousal,

16:31.124 --> 16:32.857
Plateau,

16:33.492 --> 16:34.892
Orgasm and...

16:34.894 --> 16:36.561
Sorry to stop you
again, doctor.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.529
But orgasm's a problem.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.497
For some people, yes.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.265
No, I mean
for the censors.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.468
It's one of
the four stages.

16:43.470 --> 16:46.904
You're gonna
have to call it
something different.

16:46.906 --> 16:47.372
"climax?"

16:47.374 --> 16:50.208
No, "climax" is not
one of the stages.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.378
(sighs)
"climax" won't work anyway.

16:53.545 --> 16:54.746
"peak", maybe?

16:54.748 --> 16:56.514
"peak" could be good.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.119
You know
what I could use?

17:01.121 --> 17:02.120
Do you have any shots

17:02.122 --> 17:03.588
Of patients coming
into the exam room,

17:03.590 --> 17:06.524
Maybe he
unbuttons his shirt,

17:06.526 --> 17:07.291
She unzips her dress,

17:07.293 --> 17:08.593
Maybe they
smile at each other?

17:08.595 --> 17:11.929
And then you
pan over to that
geiger counter thing,

17:11.931 --> 17:14.832
With the needle jumping
all over the place.

17:14.834 --> 17:15.433
Innuendo.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.934
Innuendo,
I can get away with.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.836
I wasn't making
<i>from here to eternity.</i>

17:18.838 --> 17:21.172
Although it is
an excellent movie.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.875
I was filming the truth
of people being sexual.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.477
If you sanitize it,
you're completely
undercutting

17:26.479 --> 17:29.247
Dr. Masters and
mrs. Johnson's intentions,

17:29.249 --> 17:31.416
Which are to encourage
an honest discussion

17:31.418 --> 17:34.419
About what happens
to the body during sex.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.820
Look.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.855
You're close to it.

17:37.857 --> 17:38.856
I respect that.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.358
You're invested.
Good for you.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.893
But if can be honest
with you,

17:41.895 --> 17:46.197
You're not the best guy
to say how to put
this stuff on tv.

17:48.300 --> 17:52.270
Ridiculous, this nonsense
with the censor.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.738
It's like having
to explain a recipe

17:53.740 --> 17:56.841
Without mentioning
a single ingredient.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.177
I don't even think
this belongs to me.

17:59.179 --> 17:59.777
It doesn't.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.913
Someone must've
left it behind
at a dinner party.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.349
There weren't
any to choose from.
(sighs)

18:05.684 --> 18:07.718
Oh, your shirt
is soaked through, bill.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.620
It's hot in front
of those lights.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.457
If I can't use
the correct
scientific terminology,

18:12.459 --> 18:16.527
I'm just going
to come off like
a sweaty degenerate,

18:16.529 --> 18:19.130
Groping for
sexual euphemisms.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.667
Well, you can't see it
with the jacket on.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.572
What do you
think they'll ask me?

18:27.574 --> 18:28.973
You?

18:29.308 --> 18:33.511
Yes, they're supposed
to interview me.
Oh, that's right.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.745
I'm sure they'll
want you to tell them

18:34.747 --> 18:36.714
I don't touch
myself at the table

18:36.716 --> 18:39.217
Or wire you
up to machines
when we make love.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.252
Do you expect
them to ask about
our private life?

18:41.254 --> 18:44.388
No, that was...
Of course they won't.

18:44.723 --> 18:45.890
I'm... I'm sorry.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.459
Look, lib, you don't
have to go through this.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.129
I don't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.364
I don't feel uncomfortable.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.433
I might be good at it.

18:57.002 --> 18:57.435
Libby!

18:57.437 --> 18:59.003
Uh, they're wondering
if you're ready.

18:59.005 --> 19:03.107
Well, it certainly is
a different look for you.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.542
As henry david thoreau said,

19:04.544 --> 19:07.879
"beware of all enterprises
that require new clothes."

19:07.881 --> 19:09.180
Why don't you
wait in here, libby?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.715
They'll come get you
when you're ready.

19:10.717 --> 19:14.252
Oh! We're wearing
the same color,
you and I.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.355
Do you think
it'll look like a uniform?
(chuckles)

19:17.357 --> 19:19.157
What all of bill masters'
women wear?

19:19.159 --> 19:22.960
Not to worry.
They're shooting
in black and white.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.068
Man: Speeding.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.937
Take one.

19:33.172 --> 19:33.571
Action.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.106
Roger:
<i>Why don't you talk</i>
<i>a bit about the reaction</i>

19:35.108 --> 19:37.241
<i>When people find out</i>
<i>this is the work you do?</i>

19:37.243 --> 19:40.011
<i>The reactions to our work</i>
<i>really run the gamut,</i>

19:40.013 --> 19:42.880
<i>From outrage</i>
<i>and indignation</i>

19:42.882 --> 19:44.949
<i>To intense curiosity.</i>

19:44.951 --> 19:47.151
<i>Often in</i>
<i>the same person.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

19:47.153 --> 19:50.321
<i>I do find that</i>
<i>I'm very popular</i>
<i>at dinner parties</i>

19:50.323 --> 19:51.856
<i>Once everyone learns</i>
<i>what it is I do.</i>

19:51.858 --> 19:56.594
<i>Don't you find that</i>
<i>everyone wants the seat</i>
<i>next to yours, bill?</i>

19:57.462 --> 19:59.197
<i>No.</i>

20:01.366 --> 20:02.700
Um, I...

20:02.968 --> 20:04.902
I'd like to make clear
that the, uh...

20:04.904 --> 20:08.372
(clears throat)
...Prurient angle of the work
holds no interest to us.

20:08.374 --> 20:12.143
The goal is to
provoke conversations
about human sexuality

20:12.145 --> 20:15.546
That are not conducted
in hushed whispers.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.182
The vocabulary of sex,

20:18.184 --> 20:22.553
Words this broadcast,
uh, won't permit,

20:22.854 --> 20:24.088
Should be commonplace,

20:24.090 --> 20:28.192
Spoken as you
would refer to, say, um...

20:28.194 --> 20:32.563
A sneeze or a hiccup.
Yes, exactly.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.399
Censorship
perpetuates shame,

20:35.401 --> 20:37.168
<i>Which in turn</i>
<i>fosters ignorance</i>

20:37.170 --> 20:39.103
<i>And ignorance</i>
<i>prevents change.</i>

20:39.105 --> 20:40.972
<i>So you see,</i>
<i>it's a dangerous trajectory</i>

20:40.974 --> 20:43.374
<i>To shy away</i>
<i>from the language</i>
<i>of the body.</i>

20:43.376 --> 20:45.009
<i>While this</i>
<i>program may have...</i>

20:45.011 --> 20:47.945
I believe we have spoken
on the phone before.

20:47.947 --> 20:51.682
"mrs. Johnson is
unavailable at the moment.
May I take a message?"

20:51.684 --> 20:52.316
That's me.

20:52.318 --> 20:54.252
I thought
I recognized your voice.
Hmm.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.886
Listen, if I could just grab
a minute with her.

20:55.888 --> 21:00.424
It's kind of
a crazy day around here,
as you can see.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.961
Can I ask you something?
Off the record?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.596
Did she tell you
to take a message

21:05.598 --> 21:07.465
Automatically
every time I call?

21:07.467 --> 21:09.500
Because I almost
never reach her.

21:09.502 --> 21:13.337
Oh, no, she owes calls
to nearly everyone.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.605
Best chance
of getting through
is saying

21:14.607 --> 21:18.476
You can orgasm listening
to the traffic report
on the radio.

21:18.478 --> 21:22.246
She never stops working,
that one, round the clock.

21:22.248 --> 21:26.217
Well, good to know
it's nothing personal.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.853
I'll let her know
you're here.

21:29.554 --> 21:33.257
Dr. Masters:
...Pretense that procreation
is our only goal.

21:33.259 --> 21:34.425
Pleasure is a human need.

21:34.427 --> 21:37.194
It drives us
the way hunger does.
Yes.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.262
Or fear.
It can blind us,

21:38.264 --> 21:40.498
Or sustain us,
it can be a frustration.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.134
Or a source of
tremendous relief.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.137
Roger:
And the benefit of being
a male/female team?

21:46.139 --> 21:47.805
Can you speak to that?

21:48.473 --> 21:51.409
Uh, well, it's
an advantage, obviously.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.578
Try to incorporate
the question, bill.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.880
<i>Oh! Um...</i>

21:55.882 --> 22:01.152
<i>Mrs. Johnson and I</i>
<i>are tremendously</i>
<i>advantaged by the fact</i>

22:01.154 --> 22:02.486
<i>That she's a man</i>
<i>and I'm a woman.</i>

22:02.488 --> 22:04.355
(laughs)
the other way around.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.090
Yes, of course.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.525
Well, you can see
the benefit.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.227
We have tendency
to finish each
others sentences.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.563
When we see eye to eye,
which is not always.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.931
We have
different strengths.

22:13.933 --> 22:18.336
Certain patients might be
more comfortable with her
than me.

22:18.338 --> 22:18.903
Or vice versa.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.138
It doesn't always
break down by gender
as one might expect.

22:21.140 --> 22:26.544
Roger: And what of
the common misperception
that you two are a couple?

22:26.546 --> 22:31.315
Well, we tell people
we're married to the work.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.351
Just not each other.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.854
Roger: Okay, that's good.

22:41.593 --> 22:42.626
Betty around?

22:42.628 --> 22:46.030
The girl who
sounds like wisconsin?

22:46.032 --> 22:49.400
She had to go downstairs
for something.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.970
My key to the washroom
doesn't work,
which is ironic,

22:52.972 --> 22:55.439
'cause keys
are my business.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.174
I see, you're reading
the sports page there.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.477
You like the ponies?
(chuckles)

22:59.479 --> 23:01.112
Used to.

23:01.114 --> 23:02.780
I'm reformed.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.116
My wife won't stand
for it.

23:05.283 --> 23:06.117
And why is that?

23:06.119 --> 23:08.419
You don't want your man
to have a little fun?

23:08.421 --> 23:11.055
Oh, he's...
I'm not his wife.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.791
No, I'm waiting
for my husband.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.960
He's the subject of...

23:16.561 --> 23:18.429
All of this.

23:18.697 --> 23:20.865
So, you're
dr. Masters' wife?

23:22.200 --> 23:23.534
You're a patient?

23:23.536 --> 23:25.403
I'm virginia's ex.

23:26.171 --> 23:29.840
Funny, I didn't expect you
to look the way you do.

23:29.975 --> 23:30.508
Oh!

23:30.510 --> 23:32.410
I'm just saying,
you're a looker.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.578
They should put you
on the camera.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.813
(chuckles)

23:35.815 --> 23:38.983
Yes, well,
that's why I'm here.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.117
They wanted a few words

23:40.119 --> 23:42.520
With the woman
behind the man.

23:44.656 --> 23:46.724
Well, the woman
behind the man

23:46.726 --> 23:49.393
Behind the woman
behind the man.

23:51.029 --> 23:52.830
Sweetheart,
if that were a race,

23:52.832 --> 23:55.866
No way would you be
finishing in the money.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.507
You are very right, sir.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.079
When betty comes back,

24:09.081 --> 24:12.917
Will you tell her
that dr. Masters' wife
decided to go home.

24:14.586 --> 24:15.753
Nice to meet you.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.288
Likewise.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.104
Try 500 klrt.

24:34.106 --> 24:38.042
Man on radio:
<i>...Was fired today</i>
<i>after piloting the yankees</i>

24:38.044 --> 24:40.177
<i>To 10 american</i>
<i>league championships</i>

24:40.179 --> 24:42.213
<i>And seven</i>
<i>world championships.</i>

24:42.215 --> 24:43.547
Okay.

24:43.549 --> 24:45.483
Thank you.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.485
Glenn:
I can't find anything.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.587
Is there any news?

24:49.589 --> 24:50.354
That was tom.

24:50.356 --> 24:53.224
The police are dropping
charges on a dozen of them,

24:53.226 --> 24:54.792
But they're gonna
hold dr. King and the rest.

24:54.794 --> 24:58.729
He's still got
that trumped-up charge
hanging over his head.

24:58.731 --> 25:02.066
That "driving without
a license" bullshit.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.834
I'm sorry.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.003
You can swear
in front of her.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.839
We're waiting on
a statement from atlanta.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.208
Do you know
when you'll hear?

25:11.210 --> 25:13.410
Yeah. Could be late.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.583
(phone ringing)

25:23.855 --> 25:26.991
Congress of
racial equality.

25:28.593 --> 25:29.393
No, nothing I'm afraid.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.462
We're still waiting
for news from atlanta.

25:31.464 --> 25:34.031
Lester: I said to him,
"no, I didn't shoot

25:34.033 --> 25:36.534
"because that's when
dr. Masters and mrs. Johnson

25:36.536 --> 25:38.068
"were deciding
whether a participant

25:38.070 --> 25:39.637
"fit the criteria
for a particular study.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.973
"it was only
once they did that
I turned the camera on."

25:42.975 --> 25:45.876
He said,
"is there anything
I could cut together

25:45.878 --> 25:47.811
"to suggest
an intake interview?"

25:47.813 --> 25:49.980
Which is offensive
on three levels.

25:49.982 --> 25:53.584
First of all,
he's going to cut
my footage?

25:53.586 --> 25:55.085
Second,
isn't it misleading?

25:55.087 --> 25:57.755
And third of all,
third of all...

25:57.757 --> 26:01.125
Maybe they know
what they're doing.
What?

26:01.127 --> 26:02.693
You really believe that?

26:02.695 --> 26:05.162
I hired shep
to do a job

26:05.164 --> 26:07.097
We're not capable
of doing ourselves.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.466
Last time I tried
to explain the work,

26:09.468 --> 26:11.769
I got my hat
handed to me, literally.

26:11.771 --> 26:15.339
And if their methods
aren't exactly what
ours might be,

26:15.341 --> 26:20.077
Well, then,
we push back
when we can,

26:20.079 --> 26:21.579
But we allow them
enough latitude

26:21.581 --> 26:24.114
To do the job
we brought them in
to do.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.184
So, the end
justifies the means.

26:27.186 --> 26:32.356
I know you, dr. Masters,
as well as I think
anyone can.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.592
That doesn't sound like
something you believe.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.093
It's easy to be idealistic

26:36.095 --> 26:37.795
When your life's work
isn't at stake.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.830
Isn't that exactly
the time to be idealistic?

26:39.832 --> 26:43.033
To hold on
to your principles?
Be true to yourself?

26:43.035 --> 26:46.403
I don't need a lecture
from you, lester.

26:47.205 --> 26:48.839
Maybe you do.

26:49.407 --> 26:52.543
Maybe you need someone
who will tell you,

26:52.545 --> 26:55.346
You look very
weird in that tie.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.216
I've given you my time.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.384
Whatever talent I have.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.986
I've given every bit
of myself to this.

27:01.988 --> 27:05.389
Even my body,
as humiliating as
that experience was.

27:05.391 --> 27:10.160
So don't tell me
I don't have a stake
in how this turns out.

27:12.163 --> 27:13.263
(door opens)

27:13.265 --> 27:15.466
(door closes)

27:15.967 --> 27:17.635
Virginia:  <i>It's not</i>
<i>a good time, george.</i>

27:17.637 --> 27:19.269
I told you that
this morning.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.437
They need me
back in there.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.540
Well, I've been
trying for a week.
It's never a good time.

27:23.542 --> 27:27.578
You're afraid I'm gonna
ask you for money
or something.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.079
Are you?

27:29.280 --> 27:30.080
No.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.583
I'm flesh.
I got a gig.

27:33.084 --> 27:36.620
Six weeks
backing floyd desouza.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.189
Floyd desouza?

27:39.191 --> 27:42.426
<i>â™ª it's not the heat,</i>
<i>it's the humidity? â™ª</i>
<i>(sighs)</i>

27:42.428 --> 27:44.294
It's a very big hit
overseas.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.763
Which is where
the tour's headed.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.898
Well, that is
wonderful, george.
Yup.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.300
London, paris,
rome, madrid.

27:50.302 --> 27:54.271
And audrey's
going with you?
She is.

27:54.906 --> 27:57.574
We want the kids
to come, too.
(laughing)

27:59.544 --> 28:01.311
I'm serious.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.247
To europe?

28:03.249 --> 28:04.648
For six weeks?

28:04.650 --> 28:07.351
Uh-uh. Absolutely not.
Why not?

28:07.353 --> 28:08.886
Why not?

28:08.888 --> 28:10.888
Because it's...
It's crazy, george.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.791
Because they've never
been on a plane before

28:13.793 --> 28:14.692
Or to a big city

28:14.694 --> 28:16.860
Or even with you
for more than three
consecutive nights,

28:16.862 --> 28:19.863
But now you want
to trot them off
to europe for six weeks.

28:19.865 --> 28:20.964
You'll take them
out of school?

28:20.966 --> 28:24.435
Well, they get a week
off at thanksgiving,
three at christmas.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.270
So they'd be
missing two weeks,

28:26.272 --> 28:28.038
And they get
a chance to see europe.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.607
Tessa could see
the eiffel tower
in person.

28:30.609 --> 28:31.875
You mentioned this
to them?

28:31.877 --> 28:35.245
No, I wanted to discuss it
with you first.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.815
Well, thank you
for that, at least.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.249
But, no.
My answer is no.

28:39.251 --> 28:43.887
So you'd rather they
come home from school
to a babysitter.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.456
They love pam.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.056
A babysitter

28:46.058 --> 28:49.660
And hope that they can
stay up late enough
to see their mother.

28:50.161 --> 28:51.328
I know the hours
you're keeping.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.431
I know that you're working
around the clock.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.066
But there's no
good argument that says

28:56.068 --> 28:57.301
Waiting for their mother
to get home from work

28:57.303 --> 29:00.370
Is better for them
than being with their father
for six weeks

29:00.372 --> 29:04.007
And letting him show them
a little piece of the world.

29:12.183 --> 29:14.284
Flo: Who's there?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.487
It's me, austin.

29:16.489 --> 29:19.123
You're not the man
from across the street,
are you?

29:19.125 --> 29:21.091
The one I've seen
watching me

29:21.093 --> 29:23.060
Through the curtains?

29:23.062 --> 29:25.062
Yes, that's me.

29:25.530 --> 29:30.067
I can see
into your bathroom.
Not the bathroom.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.368
The bedroom.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.138
I can see
into your bedroom.

29:34.205 --> 29:36.340
(footsteps pattering)

29:36.407 --> 29:39.176
Promise me you're not
going to hurt me.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.779
Of course
I'm not gonna...

29:44.549 --> 29:45.682
Grab me by the hair.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.851
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.787
Like this?
Harder.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.288
You sure?
Mmm-hmm.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.523
Drag me up the stairs.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.857
Drag you
up the stairs?

29:53.859 --> 29:54.758
If you do, I'll scream.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.227
Someone'll hear you
and they'll call the police,

29:57.229 --> 30:00.230
And they'll take
you away to jail.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.734
Any time you want
to jump in here.

30:03.736 --> 30:05.702
Uh, but I'll be
acquitted.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.206
When the jury sees you,
they'll understand

30:09.208 --> 30:11.842
Why I couldn't
control myself.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.211
Well, I'm not gonna
let you take me upstairs.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.613
Okay, so you want
to do it here?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.916
Even though I know
you want me in that bed,

30:18.918 --> 30:21.919
The bed you've watched me
make love in.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.153
So wait, we do go upstairs?

30:23.155 --> 30:25.289
Not if I have
any say in it.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.324
I'm confused.

30:27.458 --> 30:30.460
I'm going upstairs,
locking the door
behind me

30:30.462 --> 30:31.762
And calling the police.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.030
You just try
to kick it down.

30:33.032 --> 30:36.300
Even if you get in,
I'll never give in to you.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.946
Are you coming?

30:54.919 --> 30:58.088
Oh! Bill and virginia,
bernadette and kyle.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.424
Bernadette and kyle,
bill and virginia.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.725
Hello, nice to meet you.

31:01.727 --> 31:02.426
It's dr. Masters.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.795
I'm not sure exactly
how this is going to work.

31:04.797 --> 31:08.265
Oh, well, dwight says
that your cameraman
didn't get footage

31:08.267 --> 31:10.601
Of you conducting
any intake interviews.

31:10.603 --> 31:12.336
So we're gonna
have them sit in,

31:12.338 --> 31:15.205
As if they're a couple
coming to you for help.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.139
Help with what?

31:16.141 --> 31:17.941
Roger:
With their sex life.

31:17.943 --> 31:20.110
We don't help couples
have sex,

31:20.112 --> 31:22.246
We observe them
having sex.

31:22.248 --> 31:22.946
In that whole process,

31:22.948 --> 31:25.048
That's definitely gonna
be part of the story,
certainly.

31:25.050 --> 31:28.752
Um, but I think
the centerpiece
is the work you're doing

31:28.754 --> 31:30.754
That goes beyond
educating the public

31:30.756 --> 31:31.488
As to how the body works

31:31.490 --> 31:34.858
And puts that knowledge
to practical use
with treatment.

31:34.860 --> 31:35.626
We talked about this.

31:35.628 --> 31:37.828
We haven't gotten
to treating dysfunction.

31:37.830 --> 31:40.130
We're still in
the very early stages
of that.

31:40.132 --> 31:44.101
All we really need is
a few shots of you two
taking to a couple.

31:44.103 --> 31:47.304
And over that
we're gonna hear
something like,

31:47.306 --> 31:50.374
"masters and
johnson's study

31:50.376 --> 31:52.242
"is poised to break
new ground

31:52.244 --> 31:54.578
"in the treatment
of sexual dysfunction."

31:54.580 --> 31:55.212
And you are poised,

31:55.214 --> 31:58.048
So we're not saying
anything that isn't true.
Exactly.

31:58.050 --> 32:02.753
Roger: This will amount to
no more than 15 seconds
of screen time.

32:02.755 --> 32:03.420
It's just a visual.

32:03.422 --> 32:08.725
Frankly, we can't use
the footage you already have,
it's just...

32:08.727 --> 32:09.927
It's too graphic.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.261
I'd never allow it
anyway.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.396
The understanding
with patients

32:12.398 --> 32:14.865
Is that footage
is confidential,

32:14.867 --> 32:16.500
For research
purposes only,

32:16.502 --> 32:17.434
Not as a calling card

32:17.436 --> 32:19.403
For services
we don't provide.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.471
Roger: That's the case
for working with a couple

32:21.473 --> 32:24.241
Whose privacy
you're not
actually violating,

32:24.243 --> 32:27.277
Who've actually signed up
to be filmed.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.880
And are you a couple?

32:29.882 --> 32:31.682
We met just now
in the lobby.

32:31.684 --> 32:34.084
Turns out, we went
to the same high school.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.118
So you've hired actors?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.086
Virginia:
Will you excuse me?

32:36.088 --> 32:38.488
Where are you going?
Just for a moment.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.190
Virginia.

32:40.658 --> 32:42.960
Bill, what is
the problem here?

32:42.962 --> 32:46.330
If your own patients
won't participate...

32:46.332 --> 32:47.397
But they're led to believe

32:47.399 --> 32:49.566
I exploit other patients
for my own purposes?

32:49.568 --> 32:52.703
Really? You don't see that
as a problem?

32:52.904 --> 32:54.237
Well...

32:54.239 --> 32:56.039
You've never
been to court?

32:56.041 --> 32:59.509
Had any reason
to modify his visitation?
No.

32:59.511 --> 33:03.480
And he's been responsible
while they've been
in his custody?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.782
For the most part.

33:06.384 --> 33:06.783
(sighs)

33:06.785 --> 33:10.187
Yes, he has
been responsible.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.322
Any reason to think
that might change?

33:12.324 --> 33:17.260
That they wouldn't
be safe with him
or with the new wife?

33:17.262 --> 33:17.861
No.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.697
You offering them
something better?

33:20.898 --> 33:23.367
Well, we always spend
the holidays together.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.569
We have a lot
of christmas traditions.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.338
They would be
missing all of that.

33:28.406 --> 33:33.243
So they swap one christmas
for six weeks in europe?

33:34.245 --> 33:37.748
I think they'd
come out ahead,
don't you?

33:38.416 --> 33:41.651
And would it be
such an awful thing
for you?

33:41.653 --> 33:44.755
I see the way you
run around here,
the hours you keep.

33:44.757 --> 33:48.658
The second you're through,
the way you bolt
for the elevator,

33:48.660 --> 33:50.527
Probably racing
straight home

33:50.529 --> 33:52.829
For tuck-in time,
am I right?

33:52.831 --> 33:55.866
Of course I'm right.
You're a mother.

33:55.868 --> 33:56.700
I know mothers.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.670
Most of them could
use a little break
every now and then.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.273
Maybe one way
to look at this is that

34:03.275 --> 34:06.843
Your ex is offering you
a little vacation, too.

34:06.845 --> 34:09.880
Uh, I... I don't
want a vacation

34:09.882 --> 34:12.349
From my children,
mr. Spleeb.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.318
Look, you could say no.

34:15.420 --> 34:16.620
I could?
Yeah.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.855
Technically,
you have the right.

34:18.857 --> 34:22.159
But I would
caution you against it.

34:22.161 --> 34:25.996
Why give him reason
to revisit, uh,
a custody arrangement,

34:25.998 --> 34:29.366
Which, on the whole,
is working for both of you?

34:29.368 --> 34:34.504
You push back on this,
on a reasonable request,

34:34.506 --> 34:38.341
Something your kids
are gonna derive
benefit from,

34:38.476 --> 34:42.279
You could be opening up
a whole can of worms.

34:42.513 --> 34:45.615
I don't think
you wanna do that.

34:51.355 --> 34:54.791
Maryanne said
we're out of formula.

34:55.526 --> 34:56.726
Go.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.595
You, too, donner.
And harlan.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.731
Not gonna hear anything.
See you in the morning.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.200
Good night.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.801
Night.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.271
There's no point
in you staying either.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.240
Oh, I don't mind.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.109
I'm leaving myself.

35:13.077 --> 35:15.345
Oh! Well...

35:15.446 --> 35:19.483
I was expecting to go home
with my husband,
so I got a lift in.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.818
I need to call a cab.

35:27.058 --> 35:31.161
Next, he'll have us
pretending to wire them up.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.195
Actors!

35:32.197 --> 35:33.296
He needs cutaways.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.799
The entirety of your story
cannot be told

35:35.801 --> 35:37.968
With the two of you
sitting behind a table,

35:37.970 --> 35:40.804
Talking about things
that can't be shown on tv.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.806
A re-enactment
is a happy medium.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.708
I'm not happy
about any of this.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.043
It's fake, all of it,

35:47.045 --> 35:47.811
What I'm pretending to be,

35:47.813 --> 35:51.715
The fact
I'm selling something
that doesn't even exist.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.849
I am not a salesman, shep.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.819
Well, then, bill,
you're the only one,

35:55.821 --> 35:57.821
Because we are all
selling something.

35:57.823 --> 36:01.458
I sold you on me,
on what I could do for you.

36:01.460 --> 36:05.095
John rock sold more
than the birth control pill,

36:05.097 --> 36:06.463
He sold an idea,

36:06.465 --> 36:09.366
Of pleasure without
permanent consequence.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.867
He kicked open
the door for you,

36:10.869 --> 36:12.836
But you've got
to walk through it,

36:12.838 --> 36:14.638
Stake your claim
and say,

36:14.640 --> 36:15.872
"I'm in
the pleasure business, too."

36:15.874 --> 36:19.709
That is not my business.
I don't have a business.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.411
I have a study,
a practice,

36:21.413 --> 36:25.649
And I haven't
cured one single case
of sexual dysfunction.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.651
Yet, yet.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.286
But you will.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.655
And if you don't,
you tried.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.456
You got to reach
for it, bill,

36:33.458 --> 36:35.358
Even if it's
outside your grasp.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.195
It's the reaching
that people respect.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.996
Look, these two
presidential candidates,

36:39.998 --> 36:44.067
They may not
deliver a single thing
that they promise.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.369
I guarantee you
history will judge them

36:46.371 --> 36:49.139
Just as much
for the nobility
of their goals

36:49.141 --> 36:51.308
As for what
they actually achieved.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.643
But before any of that
can happen,

36:53.645 --> 36:56.513
One of them
has to come in first.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.315
You gotta be first, bill.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.351
That's what all of this
is about.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.360
Libby: There's usually news
at the top of the hour.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.362
(static over radio)

37:12.364 --> 37:14.731
(soft music playing)

37:17.902 --> 37:21.137
This is the station
you listen to?

37:21.572 --> 37:25.242
There won't be
any martin news
on this station.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.476
(changes station)

37:26.478 --> 37:29.479
It'll be here,
if anywhere.

37:31.616 --> 37:33.550
He's not going to get out.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.720
They want to make
an example of him,
is that it?

37:36.722 --> 37:39.456
No, they'll
likely offer him a deal

37:39.458 --> 37:41.391
'cause they'll realize
all they're doing

37:41.393 --> 37:44.461
Is shining a spotlight
on the cause.

37:45.796 --> 37:48.498
But dr. King won't take it.

37:49.033 --> 37:52.202
He said, "let us not fear
going to jail.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.537
"if the officials
threaten to arrest us

37:54.539 --> 37:56.706
"for standing up
for our rights,

37:56.708 --> 37:58.008
"we must show
we are willing

37:58.010 --> 38:01.278
"and prepared
to fill up the jails
of the south."

38:02.079 --> 38:03.380
He said that tonight?

38:03.382 --> 38:06.483
In durham,
back in February.

38:06.485 --> 38:09.786
At a sit-in
organized by the sclc.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.421
Oh.

38:13.224 --> 38:16.359
You know what
the sclc is, right?

38:16.661 --> 38:18.495
Of course, the...

38:18.596 --> 38:20.897
The south
carolina liberation...

38:20.899 --> 38:24.834
Southern christian
leadership conference.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.805
(scoffs)

38:29.740 --> 38:32.142
Do you enjoy that?

38:32.144 --> 38:33.977
Testing me?

38:33.979 --> 38:36.413
Because you do it a lot.

38:37.248 --> 38:42.352
Sometimes I can't tell
if you're hoping
I'll pass or fail.

38:42.453 --> 38:45.255
Why would I
want you to fail?

38:46.357 --> 38:50.327
Maybe because
it'd make it easier
for you to chalk me up

38:50.329 --> 38:54.597
To being some silly,
fly-by-night do-gooder.

38:55.266 --> 38:57.434
It's like you're
hoping to discover

38:57.436 --> 39:02.672
Underneath it all,
I'm really just
a dilettante.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.107
A militant?

39:04.109 --> 39:05.375
A dilettante.

39:05.377 --> 39:08.278
You don't know
what a dilettante is?

39:08.280 --> 39:09.779
I don't.

39:09.781 --> 39:14.417
Well, I, for one,
don't think that
makes you stupid.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.619
I don't think
you're stupid.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.954
I think you're uninformed.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.255
On some of
the specifics, yes.

39:19.257 --> 39:24.994
But I understand
what the fight is about,
and I believe in it.

39:25.229 --> 39:26.796
Why?

39:26.798 --> 39:29.065
I want to hear
your reasons.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.368
Another test.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.635
You know what I think?

39:32.637 --> 39:36.439
I think you don't want
to say "thank you" to me

39:36.441 --> 39:39.209
And seem like you mean it.

39:39.910 --> 39:42.579
What is he doing?

39:50.654 --> 39:54.424
Hey, boy,
what business you got
in this neighborhood?

39:54.426 --> 39:55.759
We're fine, officer.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.228
Let me see your license
and registration.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.362
I break
some kind of law?

39:59.364 --> 40:00.864
It's really
not necessary, officer.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.500
I know this gentleman.
He's with me.

40:03.502 --> 40:04.601
What do you mean,
"with you"?

40:04.603 --> 40:10.407
He's a co-worker of mine,
and he was kind enough
to drive me home.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.341
If that's the case,

40:11.343 --> 40:13.843
Why don't you head on in,
and he can be on his way?

40:13.845 --> 40:17.814
Because I've
invited him inside,
that's why?

40:17.816 --> 40:21.151
Are you coming,
mr. Franklin?

40:32.129 --> 40:33.463
Get that
out of my face.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.931
You better
watch yourself, boy.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.900
Stop it. Stop it.
Let him go.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.169
You have no cause, officer.

40:41.572 --> 40:44.407
Mr. Franklin,
are you coming?

40:57.087 --> 40:59.589
(indistinct conversations)

41:12.303 --> 41:13.303
You're not eating?

41:13.305 --> 41:16.539
These sesame noodles
aren't half bad.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.174
You mind me
asking you something?

41:18.176 --> 41:21.177
The boys and I
were kind of wondering.

41:21.179 --> 41:24.347
What it's like
watching folks
go at it all day long?

41:24.349 --> 41:24.914
I'm sorry?

41:24.916 --> 41:28.618
Maxine and I
once saw two chimps
doing it at the zoo,

41:28.620 --> 41:30.520
Had to go home to bed,
we were hot and bothered.

41:30.522 --> 41:35.191
And watching it
all alongside a woman
like virginia...

41:35.193 --> 41:38.695
Mrs. Johnson is
my professional colleague,

41:38.697 --> 41:40.330
Despite what
people assume.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.130
We explained that.

41:41.132 --> 41:45.034
Honestly, I don't think
people assume it.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.870
No offense.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.939
But a girl like that,
a guy like you...

41:49.941 --> 41:51.441
Excuse me?

41:51.443 --> 41:52.609
I know how it is.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.544
My maxine is a real dish.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.479
I get "the beauty
and the beast" constantly.

41:56.481 --> 41:58.047
Roger: Okay, everyone,
break's over.

41:58.049 --> 42:00.717
Back in the conference room
in 10.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.686
Make sure jeremy
powders you up.

42:03.688 --> 42:06.155
You got a real shine
going there.

42:07.892 --> 42:11.027
I know bill keeps a box
of extra shirt buttons
in here somewhere.

42:11.029 --> 42:14.230
Robert:
What do you reckon
that babysitter thought?

42:14.232 --> 42:17.267
You bringing a negro man
into your house?

42:17.701 --> 42:19.068
Well, she's not...

42:19.070 --> 42:21.504
She's a neighbor,
just helping out
for today.

42:21.506 --> 42:24.574
You heard
what I told her.
We work together.

42:24.576 --> 42:27.076
A negro man
in a torn shirt?

42:27.078 --> 42:29.245
Elaine is not a gossip.

42:30.614 --> 42:34.017
Her daughter sissy
married a mexican man.

42:35.219 --> 42:39.088
Here, we go.
Shirt, please.

42:40.157 --> 42:42.025
It'll make this easier.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.293
No, ma'am.

42:43.295 --> 42:46.696
Fine, I will sew
with you in it.

42:46.698 --> 42:49.399
Go sit by the light.

42:50.301 --> 42:53.736
Not in this room.
Not there.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.205
Virginia: Now, doesn't
that sound exciting?

42:56.207 --> 42:58.608
We miss school
on top of it?

42:58.610 --> 42:59.275
No spinning, henry.

42:59.277 --> 43:01.811
Yes, we'll have to
check with ms. Braddock
and mrs. Alexander,

43:01.813 --> 43:05.748
And you have to promise
you'll do homework
on the plane.

43:05.750 --> 43:06.683
We get to go
on a plane, too?

43:06.685 --> 43:09.152
How else do you think
we'd get there,
ding-dong?

43:09.154 --> 43:12.689
What did I say about
calling your sister names,
henry?

43:12.691 --> 43:15.792
This is a special treat,
dinner here with your mom,

43:15.794 --> 43:16.859
So you behave, okay?

43:16.861 --> 43:20.463
Pam, do you mind
giving us a few minutes?

43:20.465 --> 43:21.931
Oh, sure, no problem.

43:21.933 --> 43:23.967
What if I find
some crispy green beans?

43:23.969 --> 43:25.969
No almond cookies
for you, tessy,

43:25.971 --> 43:27.403
Until you eat your greens.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.339
You know the rules.

43:31.842 --> 43:35.478
Now you know,
six weeks is a long time,

43:35.480 --> 43:39.716
So you both
have to promise me
you'll be responsible.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.218
Because you know
how sometimes

43:42.220 --> 43:44.587
Daddy forgets to feed you
dinner on time.

43:44.589 --> 43:45.455
Tessa: Audrey remembers.

43:45.457 --> 43:47.857
She makes us eat
vegetables all the time.

43:47.859 --> 43:51.894
Henry: Mom, can you tell her
I get to stay up till 10:00
on the trip?

43:51.896 --> 43:53.596
She's so strict
about bedtimes.

43:53.598 --> 43:56.199
But she lets you watch
<i>have gun - will travel.</i>

43:56.201 --> 43:58.267
That's because
she likes it, too.

43:58.269 --> 44:00.603
She was a gunfighter
in a past life.

44:00.605 --> 44:01.270
And an opera singer.

44:01.272 --> 44:04.107
Even though she has
the worst voice.

44:04.109 --> 44:04.974
You should
hear her, mom.

44:04.976 --> 44:08.311
She and dad
sing in the car,
and it sounds awful.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.647
You think she told
me to pick France
for my project

44:10.649 --> 44:13.516
Because she knew
we were going there?

44:15.919 --> 44:16.986
Could be.

44:16.988 --> 44:19.022
What are you
doing for christmas?

44:19.024 --> 44:20.089
You're gonna have a tree?

44:20.091 --> 44:22.759
Oh, I don't know, goosey.

44:22.761 --> 44:25.294
We will have christmas
when you're back.

44:25.296 --> 44:27.630
Who's going to
give you presents?

44:30.000 --> 44:34.904
You will send me letters
and postcards,

44:34.906 --> 44:35.772
From every place you go,

44:35.774 --> 44:40.777
And you'll tell me
everything you're seeing
and doing,

44:42.279 --> 44:44.480
And that will be
my present.

44:53.390 --> 44:56.159
There you go. Try it.

45:00.597 --> 45:03.733
Button's too big.
It won't fit in the holes.

45:03.735 --> 45:05.635
Are you sure?

45:06.003 --> 45:09.439
I should go.
I have smaller ones.

45:09.441 --> 45:11.908
I got a momma
three doors down
from mine

45:11.910 --> 45:13.342
Who can fix it.

45:13.344 --> 45:16.012
What would she think
of you being here?

45:16.014 --> 45:17.747
She wouldn't
like it very much.

45:17.749 --> 45:23.086
She'd say I was just
looking for trouble,
which I'm not.

45:23.088 --> 45:25.588
You've gone
looking for it before.

45:25.889 --> 45:28.691
That time you stole
those tires.

45:29.093 --> 45:30.493
What did that
feel like?

45:30.495 --> 45:32.795
To put a brick through
a plate glass window?

45:32.797 --> 45:36.265
That was a long time ago.
I know better now.

45:36.267 --> 45:40.036
Those are
the mistakes you make
when you're a dumb kid.

45:40.671 --> 45:43.072
I never got to be that.

45:43.074 --> 45:47.677
Dumb, maybe,
but never a kid.

45:48.679 --> 45:51.714
They called me
the little grown-up,

45:51.716 --> 45:53.149
And I was so proud of that,

45:53.151 --> 45:57.520
Being good
and following the rules.

45:57.522 --> 45:59.956
Anything to be
the teacher's pet.

46:00.124 --> 46:04.227
But you then grow up,
and there's no teacher
to please.

46:04.229 --> 46:08.965
Just some idea
of what people expect
from a pretty girl.

46:08.967 --> 46:13.903
Make a nice home,
you raise well-behaved
children.

46:13.905 --> 46:18.040
Don't make waves,
don't make trouble,

46:18.342 --> 46:20.843
And keep your voice down.

46:21.979 --> 46:23.546
And you go
along like that,

46:23.548 --> 46:28.551
And your wanting to be good
makes you quiet,

46:29.386 --> 46:33.289
So quiet that you forget
the sound of your own voice.

46:34.992 --> 46:38.127
People forget
that you're there.

46:38.996 --> 46:42.031
Your husband forgets
that you're there.

46:44.368 --> 46:47.036
Maybe you aren't.

46:49.006 --> 46:51.440
Then you meet someone
who doesn't like you
very much,

46:51.442 --> 46:57.113
Who doesn't think
that you're kind or good,

46:57.314 --> 47:00.683
Who thinks that
you're ignorant,

47:00.685 --> 47:02.518
Prejudiced, even.

47:03.086 --> 47:06.923
Which maybe,
deep down, you are.

47:08.959 --> 47:14.130
And this thing
that you've been
afraid of forever,

47:14.132 --> 47:17.433
Someone thinking ill
of you, it is...

47:19.269 --> 47:21.704
It is almost a relief.

47:21.706 --> 47:24.674
Because at least
someone is seeing you.

47:24.676 --> 47:26.876
You're not invisible.

47:31.615 --> 47:32.715
You got nerve.

47:32.717 --> 47:35.985
Making an argument
that being discounted
makes you feel alive.

47:35.987 --> 47:38.387
I can tell you
it doesn't.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

47:38.389 --> 47:40.656
There are white women
who want colored men

47:40.658 --> 47:43.559
Because they don't like
themselves very much,

47:43.561 --> 47:47.129
Like they're
lowering themselves.

47:47.131 --> 47:50.399
Do you think
I'm like that?

47:51.034 --> 47:53.069
Are you?

47:54.104 --> 47:56.472
I don't know.

47:57.307 --> 47:59.742
I don't know who I am.

47:59.744 --> 48:00.810
I don't know what I am.

48:00.812 --> 48:04.213
I don't know
why I want what I want,

48:04.815 --> 48:06.849
But I just think...

48:08.852 --> 48:10.720
What?

48:11.455 --> 48:13.923
If you would...

48:14.625 --> 48:18.728
Kiss me, then maybe
I could figure it out.

48:21.632 --> 48:25.234
You've got a neighbor
across the street,

48:25.236 --> 48:27.570
A policeman
down the block,

48:27.572 --> 48:31.140
And two little ones
sleeping down the hall.

48:33.310 --> 48:34.877
And you,

48:34.879 --> 48:38.214
On the other side
of that plate glass window.

49:00.537 --> 49:02.571
(music playing)

49:06.710 --> 49:09.045
So you enjoyed that?

49:09.047 --> 49:11.347
It kind of ruins it
when I have to tell you

49:11.349 --> 49:13.249
What to do every second.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.718
Don't I get points
for not knowing
the right way

49:15.720 --> 49:17.987
To take advantage
of a woman?

49:29.099 --> 49:31.701
Oh, lighten up, austin.

49:31.703 --> 49:35.438
You've never played games
in the bedroom before?

49:36.073 --> 49:38.307
Mmm. Sure.

49:39.676 --> 49:41.277
Sleeping beauty.

49:41.279 --> 49:43.946
The milkmaid
and the stable boy.

49:44.281 --> 49:45.448
(laughing)

49:45.450 --> 49:48.985
The professor
and the foreign
exchange student.

49:48.987 --> 49:54.957
But I just don't understand
playing at this.

49:56.293 --> 50:00.563
You haven't always
been this good-looking,
have you?

50:00.565 --> 50:04.166
Weren't you ever
a pimply-faced beanpole?

50:04.168 --> 50:05.668
Didn't you want
to smack some girl

50:05.670 --> 50:07.503
For looking
right through you?

50:07.505 --> 50:08.838
Screw the indifference
out of her

50:08.840 --> 50:12.575
By making her want you
in spite of herself?

50:14.111 --> 50:17.046
I think maybe...

50:17.714 --> 50:20.282
That's your story.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.252
Huh!

50:24.388 --> 50:27.023
Maybe it is.

50:29.192 --> 50:32.661
Maybe I want
to be scarlett
for a change of pace

50:32.663 --> 50:37.366
Because I've been rhett
for a very long time.

50:37.868 --> 50:42.371
Waiting to be wanted,
not wanting to be ignored.

50:42.906 --> 50:46.308
It makes you do
the damndest things.

50:46.310 --> 50:50.980
Well, now that
you realized that
about yourself...

50:52.516 --> 50:53.382
When has self-awareness

50:53.384 --> 50:56.786
Ever changed a person's
behavior, huh?

50:58.021 --> 51:01.123
Has it ever changed yours?

51:01.358 --> 51:02.958
Nope.

51:03.026 --> 51:04.693
Sorry.

51:05.328 --> 51:07.963
I'm not ready
for this to be over.

51:07.965 --> 51:11.500
So, you can
keep coming.

51:12.636 --> 51:14.036
Even if the game
is pretending

51:14.038 --> 51:17.273
It's about more than
just job security.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.144
Although I have to say,

51:25.282 --> 51:28.851
It would be nice
if you gave a damn.

52:22.272 --> 52:23.873
Bill?

52:30.480 --> 52:32.314
Bill.

52:33.850 --> 52:35.284
What're you doing?

52:35.286 --> 52:36.886
They gone?

52:38.522 --> 52:42.124
I had to get that
goddamn thing off.

52:42.492 --> 52:44.927
The shirt, too.

52:45.762 --> 52:47.863
Soaked through.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.234
We cannot
present ourselves

52:52.236 --> 52:54.336
As the saviors of
the sexually dysfunctional

52:54.338 --> 52:57.673
Without having cured
a single patient first.

52:58.475 --> 53:00.676
Including me.

53:02.379 --> 53:06.015
Virginia, where are you?

53:07.250 --> 53:09.185
What do you mean?

53:09.187 --> 53:11.053
I'm here.

53:16.326 --> 53:17.927
I'm sorry.

53:17.929 --> 53:19.328
(sighs)

53:19.330 --> 53:21.664
It's been a long day.

53:22.999 --> 53:27.503
You think people
are gonna welcome us
into their living rooms?

53:28.705 --> 53:31.574
You, certainly, but me?

53:31.576 --> 53:33.676
You did well, bill.

53:33.678 --> 53:34.743
Roger said so.

53:34.745 --> 53:37.046
I don't have a twinkle.

53:39.282 --> 53:40.049
What?

53:40.051 --> 53:43.118
What shep said
about jack kennedy.

53:43.120 --> 53:47.356
The twinkle in his eye
that wins people over,

53:47.591 --> 53:49.592
Gets them
to invite him in.

53:49.594 --> 53:52.461
I'm not personable.
I don't smile.

53:52.463 --> 53:55.998
You smile, bill.
I've seen you smile.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.900
I'm the guy
with sweat on his brow,

53:57.902 --> 53:59.268
With makeup
stains on his collar.

53:59.270 --> 54:02.538
I'm the one
who's uncomfortable
in his own skin.

54:02.540 --> 54:03.405
Stop, please.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.873
Why would people
wanna watch me?

54:04.875 --> 54:08.510
Because you have
something important
to say.

54:08.512 --> 54:11.080
But they have to
wanna look at me first,

54:11.082 --> 54:14.116
Find something
attractive in me.

54:14.118 --> 54:17.186
You don't think that
you're attractive?

54:19.990 --> 54:22.558
I find you attractive.

54:22.560 --> 54:23.192
Why?

54:23.194 --> 54:24.126
What is it that
you want me to say?

54:24.128 --> 54:26.962
What do you want?
What do you want to hear?

54:26.964 --> 54:29.131
What more reassurance
can I give you?

54:29.133 --> 54:29.765
I'm here.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.934
I'm here.
I'm not at home.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.802
I'm not putting
my kids to bed.

54:33.804 --> 54:35.137
I'm here with you.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.272
Maybe you should.

54:36.274 --> 54:37.273
(sighs)
no, I'd understand.

54:37.275 --> 54:40.542
How can you possibly
want to be with me?

54:40.544 --> 54:41.210
With... With this?

54:41.212 --> 54:42.611
Someone who looks
like this?

54:42.613 --> 54:44.546
All the makeup
in the world...

54:44.548 --> 54:46.515
I'm the guy
who doesn't smile!

54:46.517 --> 54:47.783
I can't twinkle!

54:47.785 --> 54:49.318
I can't fuck!

54:49.552 --> 54:51.153
(breathing heavily)

54:57.894 --> 54:59.862
No, just...

55:05.835 --> 55:07.236
Shh.

55:08.538 --> 55:11.307
I'm here.
(sobbing)

55:11.941 --> 55:13.208
Shh.

55:15.645 --> 55:17.279
Shh.

55:36.866 --> 55:39.735
It's all right.

55:41.905 --> 55:44.506
It's all right.
