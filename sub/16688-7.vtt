WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:13.100
47, 48, 49.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.200
( Telephone rings )
( Groans )

00:15.920 --> 00:16.940
Rawls speaking.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.540
What's that?

00:18.640 --> 00:20.860
Meteor? Headed right towards
the Space Tree?

00:20.960 --> 00:23.600
Activate space binoculars!

00:26.320 --> 00:27.460
What in the ââ?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.560
Decrease magnification.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.660
Got you again, Rawls!

00:32.760 --> 00:34.340
( Laughs )

00:34.440 --> 00:37.840
( Groans ) Space Bush!

00:38.400 --> 00:40.400
Do you know why I brought
you here, Muscle Man?

00:40.240 --> 00:41.940
If this is about
the quantum toilet,

00:42.040 --> 00:43.660
it was backed up
when I got there.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.860
What? No.
This is way bigger than that.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.740
I'm talking
serious stuff here.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.220
I'm talking pranks.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.700
Sir?
Allow me to explain.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.940
This is Carlton Tanner
of the Space Bush station,

00:56.040 --> 00:57.420
our longtime rivals.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.180
He's been pranking me
since our days in the academy.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.340
So many stink bombs,
so many wet willies.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.780
I can still feel them in there
squirming around.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.540
What does that
have to do with me?

01:08.640 --> 01:11.340
I've tried to get back at Tanner
for years,

01:11.440 --> 01:12.820
but he's just too good.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.340
Muscle Man, I believe
you're the greatest prankster

01:15.440 --> 01:16.380
in the galaxy.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.140
I need you
to prank Tanner.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.980
What's in it for me,
Rawls?

01:21.080 --> 01:21.940
What's in it for you?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.340
Equipment, personnel,

01:23.440 --> 01:26.940
the power of the Space Tree
at your disposal, and...

01:27.040 --> 01:29.140
the opportunity to pull off

01:29.240 --> 01:32.140
the biggest prank
in space history.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.900
Pranking in space...

01:35.000 --> 01:36.500
I'm in.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.660
Whoa.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.140
Oh, yeah,
we don't mess around.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.360
How's everything coming,
Professor Prankenstein?

01:42.440 --> 01:45.980
I told you it's pronounced
"Pronkâenâsteen"!

01:46.080 --> 01:48.080
Here,
have a look for yourself.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.940
Ugh! It's puke.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.180
Correction ââ fake puke!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.900
It looks real to
the untrained eye, does it not?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.380
It even smells like
the real thing.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.940
( Inhales deeply )

02:00.040 --> 02:02.040
( Gags )

02:02.360 --> 02:04.380
This is
my latest creation.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.740
It may not look like much,

02:05.840 --> 02:08.340
but once combined with
an average dinner mint,

02:08.440 --> 02:11.180
it becomes so much more.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.300
Textured. ( Grunts )

02:22.400 --> 02:23.860
Does he always do this?

02:23.960 --> 02:25.960
Shh! Don't break
his concentration.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.420
I got a plan.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.460
But I'm gonna need my team
to pull it off.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.440
( Heroic music plays )

02:52.080 --> 02:54.500
Okay, bros,
as you may or may not know,

02:54.600 --> 02:56.300
the Space Tree
has fallen victim

02:56.400 --> 02:59.220
to a ruthless prank
by the Space Bush.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.900
We've been mooned.

03:01.000 --> 03:01.860
( All gasp )

03:01.960 --> 03:02.980
( Both chuckle )

03:03.080 --> 03:04.780
Hey!
You wouldn't be laughing

03:04.880 --> 03:06.940
if you had a butt
staring you in the face!

03:07.040 --> 03:09.940
Luckily, I have devised
an elaborate prank

03:10.040 --> 03:12.960
that will put Space Bush
in their place.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.420
I present to you
Operation Slime Bomb.

03:18.520 --> 03:21.140
Props to Mordecai
for the sweet graphic.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.820
First, we will
infiltrate the Space Bush

03:23.920 --> 03:26.860
and shut down their force field
from the inside,

03:26.960 --> 03:28.780
allowing us to easily
board their ship.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.340
Then we'll go in
with these bad boys ââ

03:31.440 --> 03:35.260
55âgallon drums filled
with Dr. Prankenstein's
secret formula.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.360
Each drum
is rigged with a timer

03:36.800 --> 03:38.260
set to give us
just enough time

03:38.360 --> 03:40.400
to drop them off at key points
throughout the ship.

03:40.480 --> 03:43.580
Then we'll make our escape,
and boom!

03:43.680 --> 03:45.820
Total slime coverage.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.900
And then we celebrate
like champs.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.940
Any questions?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.620
Uh, that seems pretty
complicated.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.720
Can't we just
moon them back?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.020
Who's in charge
of this operation?

03:54.120 --> 03:55.460
Me! That's who!

03:55.560 --> 03:57.560
And if you don't agree
with my methods,

03:56.800 --> 03:58.800
then you can walk.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.800
Hi Five: Everything is in order,
Muscle Man.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.280
Good. Systems check.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.300
Keep stirring, Pops.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
We got to get
the right consistency here.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.060
( Crash! )

04:10.160 --> 04:11.340
Aah!

04:11.440 --> 04:13.580
Benson, I thought you knew
how to drive this thing!

04:13.680 --> 04:14.980
Why?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.060
Why would I know how to drive
a space forklift?

04:17.160 --> 04:18.660
Read the manual!

04:18.760 --> 04:20.940
I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.560
The timer mechanisms
are installed as you requested.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.060
Hmm.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.900
Not level.
Start over.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
( Groans )
( Beeping )

04:31.080 --> 04:32.220
Commander Rawls?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.700
Muscle Man,
it's the Space Bush!

04:34.800 --> 04:36.060
They're at it again.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.780
Look.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.740
( Laughs )

04:41.840 --> 04:46.180
How could their bare butts
withstand the vacuum of space?

04:46.280 --> 04:48.780
There's no more time,
Muscle Man.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.660
No time to spare, guys.
Time to do this now.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.980
Dude, this could be
a good look for me.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.620
Sergeant Tanner,

05:04.720 --> 05:06.720
we have an unknown spacecraft
approaching the ââ

05:05.600 --> 05:06.700
Aah!

05:06.800 --> 05:08.220
( Laughs )

05:08.320 --> 05:09.460
Ah, don't worry.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.660
They won't get past
the force field.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.540
( Warbles )

05:13.640 --> 05:14.700
This better work.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.060
Man:
<i>Welcome, courier ship.</i>

05:16.160 --> 05:19.240
<i>Please state your purpose.</i>
Uh, we're, uh ââ

05:18.600 --> 05:20.220
Congratulations!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.740
You just won
a free flatscreen TV!

05:22.840 --> 05:24.840
<i>No, thanks.</i>
<i>We've got more flatscreens</i>

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
<i>than we know</i>
<i>what to do with here.</i>

05:26.000 --> 05:28.100
Are they ultra HD?
<i>Of course.</i>

05:28.200 --> 05:29.700
Intergalactic
channel access?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.220
<i>Duh. We're in space.</i>

05:31.320 --> 05:33.320
This TV makes pancakes.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.560
HmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHm!
HmâHmâHmâHmâHmâHm!

05:42.600 --> 05:44.420
( Both whistling )

05:44.520 --> 05:46.520
What do you two think
you're doing?

05:45.920 --> 05:47.920
Only Space Bush personnel
past this point.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.840
We'll take it from here.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.980
Muscle Man,
the package is in the pen.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.220
I repeat,
the package is in the pen.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.140
Phase 1 complete.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.240
Standby.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.100
( Grunts )

06:04.200 --> 06:06.200
I'm in.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.060
Recap, I'm sending the code
your way.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.160
You take it from here.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.340
Code received.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.260
Now hacking security system
mainframe.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.260
( Warbles )

06:24.360 --> 06:26.460
Force field down.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.900
Surveillance system down.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.420
Phase 2 complete.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.520
Let's roll.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.420
Muscle Man: All right,
we got about 60 seconds

06:37.520 --> 06:39.540
before they get
their systems back online.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.740
Everybody head to
your assigned drop point.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.500
The sooner
we dump the slime,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.600
the sooner we get
to celebration time.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.040
( Grunts )
Now let's move.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.140
( Alarm blaring )

06:54.240 --> 06:56.140
An alarm? But how?

06:56.240 --> 06:58.780
Woman: <i>Space Bush security</i>
<i>compromised.</i>

06:58.880 --> 07:00.780
<i>Comb the bush</i>
<i>for intruders.</i>

07:00.880 --> 07:02.880
Muscle Man,
they're on to us.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.020
You got to hurry.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.020
Copy.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.420
Come on.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.700
( Beeps )
What?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.660
Benson,
what's the hold up?

07:09.760 --> 07:11.760
( Grunts )

07:12.440 --> 07:15.180
No! Sureshot,
give me your status.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.260
Sureshot?
Sureshot!

07:17.360 --> 07:19.360
( Grunts )
Hey, watch the hair.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.440
Aah!

07:25.520 --> 07:27.780
I've got to
set this thing off manually.

07:27.880 --> 07:28.980
( Grunts )

07:29.080 --> 07:31.400
( Grunts )

07:34.280 --> 07:35.540
Well, well.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.940
Tanner: So, this is
the infamous Muscle Man.

07:39.040 --> 07:42.020
I got to say,
I expected more from Rawls.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.300
Looks to me like

07:43.400 --> 07:46.540
he got an amateur
to run this operation.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.820
Don't be
so sure of yourself.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.880
You may find
that I'm full of surprises.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.740
( Beeps )

07:54.840 --> 07:58.220
In a few seconds,
you and your whole Space Bush

07:58.320 --> 08:01.060
are gonna be covered
headâtoâtoe in slime.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.740
Oh, did you hear that,
everyone?

08:03.840 --> 08:06.620
Muscle Man is going to
slime the Space Bush.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.100
What are we gonna do?!

08:08.200 --> 08:09.740
( Cries sarcastically )

08:09.840 --> 08:11.960
I'm so scared!

08:13.800 --> 08:14.940
( Beeps )

08:15.040 --> 08:16.620
( All gasp )
You can do that?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.140
( Laughs )

08:18.240 --> 08:20.540
Aw, don't be so glum.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.140
It's not like
the whole Space Tree

08:22.240 --> 08:24.240
was counting on you
or anything.

08:23.640 --> 08:24.500
( Chuckles )

08:24.600 --> 08:26.820
Now you have two choices.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.100
You and your friends

08:28.200 --> 08:30.720
can either rot
in the Space Bush jail...

08:31.400 --> 08:33.540
...Or you can admit that

08:33.640 --> 08:36.580
<i>Iam the best prankster</i>
in the galaxy.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.960
What's it gonna be?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.420
( Groans )

08:44.520 --> 08:46.520
( Mumbling )
You're the greatest.

08:45.640 --> 08:46.940
What was that?

08:47.040 --> 08:48.460
You're the greatest
prankster.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.380
I can't hear you.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.660
You're the greatest prankster
in the galaxy!

08:54.760 --> 08:55.940
( Sobs )

08:56.040 --> 08:57.860
( Chuckles ) Well, then,

08:57.960 --> 09:00.980
as the greatest prankster
in the galaxy,

09:01.080 --> 09:04.400
I feel like I owe myself
a little reward.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.220
Now, get these Space Tree hacks
off my bush.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.060
Yes, sir,
off your bush, sir!

09:11.160 --> 09:13.160
Oh, and Muscle Man.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Cheers.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.500
Unacceptable!

09:22.600 --> 09:23.780
Do you realize how much

09:23.880 --> 09:25.740
I invested
into this operation?

09:25.840 --> 09:29.620
I thought you were
a master prankster.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.100
( Cheers and applause )

09:31.200 --> 09:33.180
And now, we toast

09:33.280 --> 09:35.980
to the best prankster
in the galaxy.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.220
Me!

09:37.320 --> 09:38.700
( Laughs )

09:38.800 --> 09:41.340
Now crack this baby open
so we can celebrate!

09:41.440 --> 09:43.940
( Cheers and applause )

09:44.040 --> 09:45.780
I hope
you're proud of yourself,

09:45.880 --> 09:47.900
because
you're a failure!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.380
Am I?

09:49.480 --> 09:51.220
( All cheering )

09:51.320 --> 09:53.320
( Beeping )
Uh, sir?

09:54.640 --> 09:55.420
Oh, no.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.420
( Beeps )

09:57.520 --> 09:59.540
( Explosion )

09:59.640 --> 10:00.740
We got 'em!

10:00.840 --> 10:02.380
( All cheering )

10:02.480 --> 10:03.980
Well, I'll be darned.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.260
Muscle Man,
you sneaky so and so.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.980
I never
should've doubted you.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.780
You're right,
you shouldn't have.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.380
