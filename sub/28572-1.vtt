01:11.279 --> 01:12.112
Yes.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.193
Thank you.

01:19.145 --> 01:21.233
I'm just gonna grab this one right here.

01:21.235 --> 01:23.960
Oh, thanks, save me
the heavy one.

01:23.962 --> 01:26.666
Of course.

01:26.668 --> 01:29.183
I told you we should've
had a garage sale.

01:29.185 --> 01:31.149
You'll be fine.

01:31.151 --> 01:31.982
What do you got in here?

01:31.984 --> 01:33.993
- Is this your rock collection?
- Maybe.

01:40.605 --> 01:41.438
Hey, no!

01:42.545 --> 01:43.376
Let me.

01:43.378 --> 01:44.753
I saw it first.

01:44.755 --> 01:47.118
So, this one's mine.

01:49.199 --> 01:50.983
I hope you don't throw your back out.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.708
Why, you wanna give me a massage?

01:55.045 --> 01:57.305
She's a little
young for you pinhead.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.374
Mom, tell Kristen to do something.

02:01.376 --> 02:02.863
She's just standing around.

02:02.865 --> 02:04.752
I'm not just standing around.

04:17.843 --> 04:19.403
Dad!

04:25.938 --> 04:27.744
- Dad!
- Maddy?

04:27.746 --> 04:29.625
The door is stuck!

04:29.627 --> 04:30.911
Maddy?

04:31.746 --> 04:32.893
Get away from the door, Maddy.

04:49.885 --> 04:51.543
Here you go.

04:51.545 --> 04:54.693
Thanks Mrs. Ryan, but, this
is more than we agreed on.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.033
I know but you guys did an amazing job.

04:58.035 --> 04:59.613
All righty well thank you.

04:59.615 --> 05:01.933
Yes, and thank you, Mrs. R.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.298
We also do home repair.

05:04.395 --> 05:05.813
Basement door.

05:05.815 --> 05:08.415
We also do free home
inspections and pest removal.

05:10.915 --> 05:12.333
Thank you.

05:12.335 --> 05:13.608
Good to know, fellas.

05:22.225 --> 05:23.425
I'll be in the garage.

05:35.605 --> 05:38.003
Well hi there neighbor.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.233
Welcome to the neighborhood.

05:39.235 --> 05:40.068
Hi.

05:41.755 --> 05:44.253
I'm Bill Lawford, this
here is my wife Penny.

05:44.255 --> 05:46.603
Some handshake you've got there.

05:46.605 --> 05:48.713
I hope your family likes
chocolate chip cookies.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.238
It's our favorite recipe.

05:51.405 --> 05:53.523
Knowing my family,
they'll never see sunrise.

05:56.015 --> 05:57.943
So uh, that's a real shame about the

05:57.945 --> 05:59.893
previous owners, huh?

05:59.895 --> 06:02.443
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.623
Uh well, you know, the
missus and her breakdown?

06:05.625 --> 06:07.253
Well I guess that's what it was.

06:07.255 --> 06:08.503
Penny, don't stop with
all that gossipy stuff.

06:08.505 --> 06:10.983
The Harris's were such
a lovely couple, you know,

06:10.985 --> 06:13.483
and she was always outside gardening.

06:13.485 --> 06:15.849
And then little by little
she stopped coming outside.

06:15.851 --> 06:16.682
That's enough, Penny.

06:16.684 --> 06:17.515
She didn't even get the mail.

06:17.517 --> 06:18.348
- That's enough.
- Oh wow.

06:18.350 --> 06:19.690
Something sure happened to her.

06:19.692 --> 06:21.883
I thought they moved 'cause Mr. Harris

06:21.885 --> 06:22.863
got a job transfer.

06:22.865 --> 06:24.893
Oh, that is partially true, he did get a

06:24.895 --> 06:28.998
job transfer, however, that
was after the missus moved out.

06:29.000 --> 06:29.831
Dad?

06:29.833 --> 06:30.694
Mom needs ya.

06:32.085 --> 06:32.916
It was a pleasure meeting both of you.

06:32.918 --> 06:33.923
- Oh yeah.
- Thanks for the cookies.

06:33.925 --> 06:35.063
Yeah, you're welcome,
I have plenty more.

06:35.065 --> 06:35.896
Oh you know what?

06:35.898 --> 06:36.729
I have an idea.

06:36.731 --> 06:38.993
Why don't they come for
a barbecue next Sunday

06:38.995 --> 06:41.293
and this was we can meet
your wife and your daughter.

06:41.295 --> 06:42.473
Hey.

06:42.475 --> 06:43.821
I'll check with the wife.

06:43.823 --> 06:48.013
You're a smart man, Michael.

06:48.015 --> 06:49.463
You talk too damn much.

06:49.465 --> 06:50.883
Oh psh.

06:50.885 --> 06:51.838
Don't psh me.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.498
Well, wait for me.

06:56.425 --> 06:57.258
Hang on.

07:12.945 --> 07:14.465
Where have you been?

07:14.467 --> 07:16.363
Met the new neighbors.

07:16.365 --> 07:17.415
Wife made us cookies.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.173
That's nice.

07:20.175 --> 07:21.128
What are they like?

07:22.015 --> 07:23.083
The cookies?

07:23.085 --> 07:26.083
No silly, the neighbors.

07:26.085 --> 07:26.918
Seem fine.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.635
Hey, what's wrong with you?

07:34.518 --> 07:38.169
I hope the neighbors aren't,
like, Rosemary's Baby.

07:38.171 --> 07:39.471
Very funny.

07:42.615 --> 07:44.903
The Harris's were
selling this place 'cause

07:44.905 --> 07:46.993
he got a job transfer, right?

07:46.995 --> 07:49.541
Yeah, that's what the realtor said.

07:49.543 --> 07:51.333
Hm.

07:51.335 --> 07:53.403
The wife said that, uh,
Mrs. Harris was already

07:53.405 --> 07:54.255
out of the house.

07:55.495 --> 07:56.563
Really?

07:56.565 --> 07:57.988
Well, what happened to her?

07:59.005 --> 08:00.053
Don't know.

08:00.055 --> 08:00.905
Didn't get to it.

08:02.365 --> 08:04.673
Well at least we got some
cookies out of the deal.

08:04.675 --> 08:06.173
That's the most important
part of the whole deal,

08:06.175 --> 08:07.006
don't you think?

08:07.008 --> 08:09.373
Yep.

08:09.375 --> 08:14.345
Michael, you forgot to go
set this out for the mailman.

08:14.347 --> 08:16.313
Hm, geez.

08:16.315 --> 08:17.436
You're sure right.

08:17.438 --> 08:18.973
I'll go do it right now.

08:18.975 --> 08:19.808
Thank you.

08:26.685 --> 08:27.518
Excuse me.

08:28.885 --> 08:30.988
I'm Michael Ryan, your new neighbor.

08:33.135 --> 08:34.684
Yep, I noticed you moving in.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.832
I have to tell you,
we sure like it here.

08:38.835 --> 08:39.835
You lived here long?

08:40.759 --> 08:42.159
I'm an original homeowner.

08:44.575 --> 08:45.878
You don't see that often.

08:47.575 --> 08:50.153
Real shame what happened
to Mrs. Harris, huh?

08:50.155 --> 08:51.308
Sure as hell was.

08:52.505 --> 08:55.728
Don't end up in a state
hospital, that's for damn sure.

08:58.475 --> 08:59.308
Don Archer.

09:06.605 --> 09:07.855
State hospital, huh?

09:19.535 --> 09:20.898
Wow, somebody's been busy.

09:24.904 --> 09:25.933
Oh, bless you.

09:25.935 --> 09:26.838
How'd you know?

09:37.215 --> 09:39.032
Did you sleep okay last night?

09:39.034 --> 09:40.433
You were moving around a lot.

09:40.435 --> 09:42.363
No, not great.

09:42.365 --> 09:44.183
I had the same stupid
nightmare that someone

09:44.185 --> 09:45.258
was chasing me.

09:48.095 --> 09:50.363
Well there's a happy camper.

09:50.365 --> 09:52.213
Dad, don't start.

09:52.215 --> 09:54.133
I'm not in the mood, all right?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.358
Barely slept last night.

09:57.075 --> 09:59.580
Why couldn't
you sleep sweetheart?

09:59.582 --> 10:02.013
I kept hearing something in the walls.

10:02.015 --> 10:03.663
Dad, we have rats.

10:03.665 --> 10:05.363
Kristen, we don't have rats.

10:05.365 --> 10:07.993
You know what, I thought
I heard something too.

10:07.995 --> 10:09.973
I'll call Adam the mover to come over

10:09.975 --> 10:11.103
and check it out.

10:11.105 --> 10:14.813
He did say they do free pest inspections.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.243
Fine.

10:16.245 --> 10:17.195
I'm gonna go shave.

10:22.055 --> 10:22.888
Mom?

10:23.935 --> 10:25.385
Something doesn't seem right.

10:26.755 --> 10:28.153
Oh nonsense.

10:28.155 --> 10:30.713
There's nothing wrong with this house.

10:30.715 --> 10:32.338
Good morning Ryan family.

10:35.245 --> 10:36.193
Where's dad?

10:36.195 --> 10:37.923
He's upstairs.

10:37.925 --> 10:40.983
Mom, Brittany's coming
over after school today.

10:40.985 --> 10:42.035
What's for breakfast?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.058
Bagels.

10:47.225 --> 10:49.860
Mom, that's not funny.

12:27.455 --> 12:30.495
Maddy, you left the
basement a mess yesterday.

12:30.912 --> 12:33.910
No I didn't,
everything was fine, honest.

12:33.912 --> 12:34.743
Dad, it's Maddy.

12:34.745 --> 12:36.507
I haven't been in the basement.

12:36.509 --> 12:38.043
It wasn't me, Kristen.

12:38.045 --> 12:40.793
Well somebody left it a
mess and whose box is that

12:40.795 --> 12:42.262
with the Ouija board?

12:42.264 --> 12:43.551
What Ouija board?

12:43.553 --> 12:45.783
The one I just found in the basement.

12:45.785 --> 12:48.253
It's probably the Harris's.

12:48.255 --> 12:49.603
Well you need to call the realtor.

12:49.605 --> 12:52.073
I don't want that kind
of stuff in our house,

12:52.075 --> 12:53.588
and call the damn rat guy.

12:58.285 --> 12:59.703
This stupid thing is broken.

12:59.705 --> 13:00.723
Not so loud.

13:00.725 --> 13:03.223
You know we're not
supposed to be down here.

13:03.225 --> 13:04.398
How can it be broken?

13:05.845 --> 13:07.408
Duh, because it doesn't move.

13:09.215 --> 13:10.048
Madison.

13:11.518 --> 13:14.083
What do you two think
you're doing down here?

13:14.085 --> 13:15.963
We were just playing
with it, that's all.

13:15.965 --> 13:17.743
Well both of you guys know better than

13:17.745 --> 13:19.245
to be playing with this thing.

13:20.145 --> 13:22.603
It's supposed to be possessed, right?

13:22.605 --> 13:25.128
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

13:26.115 --> 13:28.758
Now both of you guys, get upstairs.

13:31.074 --> 13:31.907
Now!

13:48.060 --> 13:49.560
Are you possessed?

15:45.677 --> 15:46.510
Maddy?

16:14.457 --> 16:17.138
Madison, this isn't funny.

16:29.821 --> 16:32.821
What are you looking for, Kristen?

16:33.995 --> 16:36.843
I heard some sounds from upstairs.

16:36.845 --> 16:38.645
Thought it was Maddy running around.

16:41.191 --> 16:42.078
Don't be silly.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.388
Everything's fine.

16:45.615 --> 16:47.065
It was just your imagination.

16:51.575 --> 16:54.658
Large houses tend to have a
life of their own at night.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.623
Surprised
to see you up so early.

17:13.625 --> 17:14.678
I know, right?

17:15.895 --> 17:17.373
Where's mom?

17:17.375 --> 17:19.026
She's always the first one up.

17:19.028 --> 17:21.272
Still sleepin', I guess.

17:21.275 --> 17:23.703
I don't think she slept
very well last night.

17:23.704 --> 17:24.598
Sleeping in?

17:25.444 --> 17:26.788
Mom never sleeps in.

17:29.365 --> 17:32.603
Dad, can I ask you something?

17:32.605 --> 17:33.630
Maybe.

17:33.632 --> 17:34.648
You seem so serious.

17:38.255 --> 17:41.362
Does mom seem okay to you?

17:42.624 --> 17:44.784
Of course she does, why?

17:44.786 --> 17:48.113
Well, when I got home last night I was

17:48.115 --> 17:50.583
- in the kitchen and...
- Oh, isn't this nice?

17:50.585 --> 17:52.728
A little father-daughter time.

17:56.531 --> 17:58.481
So what's for breakfast?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.793
A normal human would
just make themselves

18:01.795 --> 18:04.693
something to eat, you little brat.

18:04.695 --> 18:05.528
Kristen.

18:06.885 --> 18:08.388
Geez, what's her problem?

18:10.585 --> 18:12.603
We'll finish our chat later, okay?

18:12.605 --> 18:14.483
Whatever.

18:14.485 --> 18:16.418
Maddy, you know better.

18:26.331 --> 18:28.727
How about we go on a family hike today?

18:28.729 --> 18:30.079
A regular family adventure.

18:32.415 --> 18:34.665
- Gonna be a beautiful day...
- Michael, don't.

18:35.675 --> 18:37.525
It'll make it way too bright in here.

18:46.835 --> 18:48.203
You feelin' okay?

18:48.205 --> 18:49.038
Yeah.

18:50.235 --> 18:52.523
I think it'd be nice for you and the girls

18:52.525 --> 18:54.358
to spend some quality time together.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.593
Besides, I still have so many things to do

18:58.595 --> 19:00.213
around this house.

19:00.215 --> 19:02.433
Come on Katie, that stuff can wait.

19:02.435 --> 19:03.698
We'll do it later.

19:08.295 --> 19:11.078
No Michael, I said I needed to stay.

19:18.545 --> 19:19.963
Fine.

19:19.965 --> 19:20.798
Stay here then.

19:26.755 --> 19:28.823
What'd you mean this
morning about your mom?

19:28.825 --> 19:30.263
It's nothing.

19:30.265 --> 19:32.223
Don't nothing me, young lady.

19:32.225 --> 19:34.043
You're forgetting who you're talking to?

19:34.045 --> 19:37.013
No, I'm not forgetting
who I'm talking to.

19:37.015 --> 19:38.896
It's just weird dad, all right?

19:38.898 --> 19:41.533
When I got home from work,
I was in the kitchen.

19:41.535 --> 19:44.133
I thought I heard something
running down the hall,

19:44.135 --> 19:45.703
and up the stairs.

19:45.705 --> 19:48.203
What do you mean running down
the hall and up the stairs?

19:48.205 --> 19:50.803
Just like footsteps and voices,

19:50.805 --> 19:53.196
and someone running around upstairs.

19:53.198 --> 19:56.163
I thought it was Maddy, so I
went to check on her, right?

19:56.165 --> 19:57.493
And she was asleep.

19:57.495 --> 19:59.793
I turned around, and bam, mom was standing

19:59.795 --> 20:01.008
right in front of me.

20:03.525 --> 20:05.093
Well it was late and you were tired.

20:05.095 --> 20:06.983
I mean, you probably
just thought you heard

20:06.985 --> 20:08.193
something and, and...

20:08.195 --> 20:10.593
See, this is exactly why
I didn't wanna say anything.

20:10.595 --> 20:13.123
I knew you would just blow
this off like you always do,

20:13.125 --> 20:15.233
making me look like I'm crazy.

20:15.235 --> 20:16.135
That's not true.

20:20.496 --> 20:21.944
You okay?

20:21.946 --> 20:23.680
Enough of this family hike dad, okay?

20:23.682 --> 20:25.593
Can we go home now?

20:25.595 --> 20:26.808
I'm tired and thirsty.

20:28.905 --> 20:29.738
Yeah.

20:30.905 --> 20:33.118
I think we're all over
this family hike thing.

20:36.092 --> 20:38.925
Can you put a little weight on it?

20:46.936 --> 20:48.223
Now watch your step.

20:48.225 --> 20:49.058
Careful.

20:50.335 --> 20:52.938
Kristen, go tell your
mom we're back, please.

20:54.915 --> 20:56.303
It's all right, I'll get you to the couch

20:56.305 --> 20:57.628
and you can put your leg up.

21:00.475 --> 21:01.308
Mom?

21:03.565 --> 21:04.418
Mom?

21:06.485 --> 21:07.438
I can't find mom.

21:09.015 --> 21:09.846
Hm.

21:09.848 --> 21:10.685
Help your sister.

21:41.963 --> 21:42.796
Katie?

21:43.923 --> 21:44.923
Katie you down here?

21:48.538 --> 21:49.369
What the hell are you doin'?

21:49.371 --> 21:50.204
Come here.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.095
Let's play with this tonight
after the girls go to bed.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.518
Hell no.

22:00.745 --> 22:02.155
Michael, stop being...

22:02.157 --> 22:03.156
I want you to get
rid of this damn thing.

22:03.158 --> 22:04.833
Stop being such a pussy.

22:04.835 --> 22:06.703
What's gotten into you?

22:06.705 --> 22:08.218
It'll be fun.

22:09.055 --> 22:10.805
Then maybe you'll get some tonight.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.548
Dad, Kristen needs you.

22:18.485 --> 22:20.183
I'll be right there.

22:20.185 --> 22:21.423
That's enough of this.

22:21.425 --> 22:23.258
Come on, let's get out of here.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.911
You need to come to bed.

24:57.995 --> 24:59.084
Good morning you all.

24:59.086 --> 25:01.919
Good morning sweetheart.

25:05.205 --> 25:06.973
Hurry up slowpoke.

25:06.975 --> 25:07.806
Nicole's waiting.

25:07.808 --> 25:08.823
You're gonna make us late.

25:08.825 --> 25:10.375
You're not the boss, Kristen.

25:16.135 --> 25:16.968
Bye girls.

25:28.035 --> 25:28.868
Thanks.

25:33.045 --> 25:34.595
Sorry if I woke you last night.

25:35.555 --> 25:36.513
What are you talking about?

25:36.515 --> 25:37.928
I slept like a log.

25:40.015 --> 25:42.423
You don't remember
visiting me last night?

25:42.425 --> 25:43.825
What do you mean visiting?

25:44.885 --> 25:47.329
Visiting me,
at the top of the stairs.

25:48.685 --> 25:52.523
Michael, I did no such thing.

25:52.525 --> 25:54.123
You certainly did.

25:54.125 --> 25:55.625
You scared the hell out of me.

25:57.575 --> 25:59.718
What in the world are you talking about?

26:02.765 --> 26:06.683
Maybe you were dreaming.

26:06.685 --> 26:08.585
And what were you doing up last night?

26:11.380 --> 26:15.258
Well I wasn't dreaming.

26:20.755 --> 26:22.211
Maybe you're right.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.963
Maybe it was a dream.

26:25.305 --> 26:27.380
I gotta scoot, I got a 9:30 board meeting.

26:56.432 --> 26:57.765
Excuse me, Bill?

27:08.115 --> 27:08.948
Bill?

27:10.855 --> 27:11.688
Hey neighbor.

27:13.075 --> 27:14.033
How are you doin'?

27:14.035 --> 27:15.843
All right.

27:15.845 --> 27:16.815
Good seeing you Michael.

27:16.817 --> 27:18.673
Okay.

27:18.675 --> 27:19.803
All right.

27:19.805 --> 27:23.113
Hey, um, I was wondering
if you might know

27:23.115 --> 27:25.465
how Mrs. Harris ended up
in the state hospital.

27:26.675 --> 27:29.243
Not really, other than
I know she'd seen a priest

27:29.245 --> 27:30.808
for some mental issues, a um,

27:31.955 --> 27:34.664
what the hell is his
name, Michael, it's uh,

27:34.666 --> 27:36.973
oh, hold on.

27:36.975 --> 27:38.216
Hold on.

27:38.218 --> 27:42.113
He's a father, father, Father Bob.

27:42.115 --> 27:43.913
I forgot to give this to you.

27:43.915 --> 27:45.160
He said, "Be sure to give that to whoever

27:45.162 --> 27:47.193
"takes over the house."

27:47.195 --> 27:48.488
Whoever takes over the house?

27:48.490 --> 27:49.321
I know.

27:49.323 --> 27:50.503
It made no sense to me.

27:50.505 --> 27:53.183
I thought he was makin'
a joke or something.

27:53.185 --> 27:54.018
Oh.

27:55.470 --> 27:56.343
You mind if I keep this?

27:56.345 --> 27:58.068
No, have it, it's yours.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.074
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:01.076 --> 28:02.553
- See ya.
- Good seein' ya, pal.

28:02.555 --> 28:03.388
You, too.

28:16.685 --> 28:18.248
Mom, we're home.

28:22.815 --> 28:24.138
Mom, we're home.

28:34.775 --> 28:36.763
Go tell mom we're home.

28:36.765 --> 28:38.115
Well why can't you do it?

28:43.995 --> 28:45.260
Maddy?

28:45.262 --> 28:47.340
Fine, Kristen.

28:47.342 --> 28:48.478
Make me do everything.

28:55.825 --> 28:56.948
Mom, are you awake?

28:58.945 --> 28:59.778
Mom?

29:00.863 --> 29:01.696
Mom.

29:03.009 --> 29:03.842
Mom.

29:17.765 --> 29:19.318
So you're just gonna sit there?

29:20.235 --> 29:21.268
She's sleeping.

29:22.215 --> 29:23.483
Sleeping?

29:23.485 --> 29:25.288
It's in the middle of the afternoon.

29:26.285 --> 29:27.917
Is she sick?

29:27.919 --> 29:29.373
I don't know, Kristen.

29:29.375 --> 29:32.068
Why don't you go check yourself
if you're so interested?

29:38.953 --> 29:40.953
How was school, girls?

29:42.205 --> 29:43.038
Fine.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.875
I'm going to go do my homework.

29:47.945 --> 29:49.533
Earth to Maddy.

29:49.535 --> 29:50.938
How was school?

29:52.662 --> 29:53.812
It was okay, I guess.

29:56.625 --> 29:57.765
I'm going outside.

30:40.209 --> 30:41.042
Mom?

30:57.494 --> 30:58.327
What?

31:00.009 --> 31:02.813
You look like you've just seen a ghost.

31:02.815 --> 31:06.293
I thought I heard someone,
talking in the kitchen.

31:06.295 --> 31:08.463
Well obviously there isn't anybody

31:08.465 --> 31:11.538
talking in the kitchen.

31:14.070 --> 31:15.723
Help me peel some potatoes.

31:15.725 --> 31:16.758
It'll be fun.

31:17.595 --> 31:19.658
I want potatoes for dinner tonight.

31:21.175 --> 31:23.095
Potatoes?

31:23.097 --> 31:24.458
We never have potatoes.

31:45.745 --> 31:47.295
What's with all the potatoes?

31:48.455 --> 31:50.055
Mom wants potatoes for dinner.

31:52.085 --> 31:53.417
Potatoes?

31:53.419 --> 31:54.569
Gross, I hate potatoes.

31:58.543 --> 32:00.343
I need to go upstairs for a while.

32:01.185 --> 32:02.535
You two can finish peeling.

32:09.815 --> 32:11.178
Kristen, what's with mom?

32:12.135 --> 32:13.638
She's starting to scare me.

32:14.626 --> 32:15.753
I think we need to talk to dad.

32:15.755 --> 32:17.588
I heard that young lady!

32:19.655 --> 32:21.972
I'll talk to dad when he gets home.

32:35.495 --> 32:36.328
Hey girls.

32:39.885 --> 32:41.673
What's with the potatoes?

32:41.675 --> 32:43.738
- Mom.
- Yummy, right?

32:45.115 --> 32:45.965
I don't get it.

32:47.385 --> 32:49.443
Mom wanted us
to peel all those stupid

32:49.445 --> 32:50.608
potatoes for dinner.

32:51.505 --> 32:52.336
Why?

32:52.338 --> 32:55.773
Dad, I don't know,
but you need to do something.

32:55.775 --> 32:57.388
She's acting really weird.

32:58.655 --> 32:59.763
Where is she?

32:59.765 --> 33:01.333
Upstairs.

33:01.335 --> 33:03.268
She's been up there for a long time.

33:06.095 --> 33:07.158
I'll go check on her.

33:18.765 --> 33:21.718
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it's not polite to eavesdrop?

33:22.901 --> 33:25.213
I wasn't eavesdropping.

33:25.215 --> 33:29.178
Sure you were you silly goat.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.853
Don't ever lie to me, Michael.

33:35.855 --> 33:38.723
You never know what I might do.

33:38.725 --> 33:41.828
Besides lying doesn't suit you.

33:43.645 --> 33:45.968
Hurry up, I'm starving.

34:18.545 --> 34:22.402
Why is there so many potatoes?

34:22.405 --> 34:24.668
Because you
asked us to peel them.

34:26.435 --> 34:29.138
No, I asked you to peel a few.

34:30.225 --> 34:33.612
You went way beyond peeling, missy.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.958
Mom you said to peel the potatoes.

34:37.824 --> 34:39.858
Sweetheart, how was your day?

34:41.445 --> 34:42.408
It was good.

34:45.002 --> 34:46.938
What's a good day look
like in my wife's world?

34:51.445 --> 34:53.953
What's a day look like in my world?

34:53.955 --> 34:55.447
Are you kidding me?

34:56.585 --> 34:58.233
Well I don't sit on my ass all day

34:58.235 --> 35:00.898
if that's what you're insinuating, mister.

35:16.415 --> 35:19.283
You guys should've seen the
look on all of your faces.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.128
You, you, and you.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.312
Priceless.

35:25.314 --> 35:27.868
Absolutely priceless.

35:47.005 --> 35:48.408
I need to go to the neighbor's.

35:49.455 --> 35:50.842
Finish up, you know,

35:52.365 --> 35:54.298
you can text me if you need me.

36:14.355 --> 36:15.993
Well I'm sure you've met Don.

36:15.995 --> 36:18.853
Everyone around here
knows him as a professor.

36:18.855 --> 36:21.453
Yeah, I'm just a little
surprised to see him here.

36:21.455 --> 36:23.513
There's a lot of surprises
in this neighborhood.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.143
Hi, Michael.

36:25.145 --> 36:26.423
Can I get you something to drink?

36:26.425 --> 36:27.860
Oh no thanks.

36:27.862 --> 36:28.693
Oh.

36:28.695 --> 36:29.765
Have a seat Michael.

36:39.175 --> 36:41.175
So Michael, what do we owe the pleasure?

36:43.705 --> 36:45.733
You know what, this is
not really a good time.

36:45.735 --> 36:48.163
- I should just come back later.
- Oh, Michael, don't be silly.

36:48.165 --> 36:49.373
You're amongst friends.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.703
Have a seat.

36:50.705 --> 36:52.505
Have a drink, you're gonna need it.

36:58.875 --> 37:01.118
So Michael, what's on your mind?

37:04.745 --> 37:07.293
Actually it's about the Harris's.

37:07.295 --> 37:09.863
Oh this is gonna be good.

37:09.865 --> 37:11.938
Sure, go ahead.

37:13.585 --> 37:15.298
Well it's about Miss Harris.

37:16.735 --> 37:20.543
You said that she was
very social at first and,

37:20.545 --> 37:22.178
she changed over time.

37:24.025 --> 37:24.858
Why?

37:25.765 --> 37:27.215
Why do you think she changed?

37:30.215 --> 37:31.333
Honestly Michael?

37:31.335 --> 37:33.343
I think it has something
to do with your house.

37:33.345 --> 37:35.872
Oh dammit Penny, don't
start with that house stuff.

37:35.874 --> 37:36.705
- Well...
- She's right.

37:36.707 --> 37:38.218
And that goes for you too.

37:38.220 --> 37:39.051
It's okay, Bill,

37:39.053 --> 37:40.470
what do you mean?

37:41.755 --> 37:44.107
Don't look at me, you
got yourself into this.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.253
At the risk of sounding like a wacko,

37:47.255 --> 37:51.005
I'm just gonna say it: Michael,
your house creeps me out.

37:52.415 --> 37:53.533
It wasn't always that way.

37:53.535 --> 37:55.763
The original owners, the
Russells, they were a truly,

37:55.765 --> 37:58.993
lovely elder couple, and
they bought the house

37:58.995 --> 38:02.603
but they tore it down, left the basement,

38:02.605 --> 38:04.853
and then built another
one for their grandkids

38:04.855 --> 38:06.305
to come visit for the summer.

38:07.195 --> 38:10.453
But Mr. Russell died within
the first year of moving in.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.343
He died?

38:11.345 --> 38:12.463
Yeah.

38:12.465 --> 38:14.723
It was so sad.

38:14.725 --> 38:16.883
He fell down the basement stairs.

38:16.885 --> 38:18.503
Or was pushed.

38:18.505 --> 38:19.643
I'm sorry.

38:19.645 --> 38:21.478
- What was that?
- Eh, nevermind.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.748
Anyway, yeah.

38:26.385 --> 38:29.233
He fell down the basement
stairs, broke his neck, and died,

38:29.235 --> 38:32.162
and it was shortly thereafter
the missus sold the house.

38:34.755 --> 38:38.373
Now, it was the next
couple that moved in when

38:38.375 --> 38:40.333
things started getting strange.

38:40.335 --> 38:42.508
Uh, what do you mean getting strange?

38:43.405 --> 38:44.498
It was a couple.

38:45.435 --> 38:47.054
Don, what was their name again?

38:47.056 --> 38:47.970
Devlin.

38:47.972 --> 38:50.073
- Ah.
- Devlin was the family name.

38:50.075 --> 38:51.668
That's it, Devlin.

38:57.725 --> 39:01.113
Cathy, Don's departed wife,
my best friend, mind you,

39:01.115 --> 39:05.043
well because of her he knows
some dirty little secrets

39:05.045 --> 39:06.743
if you know what I mean.

39:06.745 --> 39:08.473
I mean, I remember a time
when the three of his

39:08.475 --> 39:11.074
- and he was...
- Oh come on Penny.

39:11.076 --> 39:11.964
Let her talk.

39:11.966 --> 39:12.797
All right.

39:12.799 --> 39:15.018
- You, too.
- All right, both of you.

39:17.525 --> 39:19.763
They kept to themselves,
and I thought it was kind

39:19.765 --> 39:21.523
of strange that they
bought such a big house

39:21.525 --> 39:23.013
because they had no kids.

39:23.015 --> 39:24.423
They were antisocial.

39:24.425 --> 39:28.043
The best you could get out
of them was a nod or a wave

39:28.045 --> 39:30.248
and that was if you made eye contact.

39:31.505 --> 39:35.933
Anyway, on the weekends,
they would have what looked

39:35.935 --> 39:39.113
like these parties

39:39.115 --> 39:40.713
that consisted of about, I don't know,

39:40.715 --> 39:42.503
- six to eight people.
- Penny, for God sakes.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.507
Michael doesn't have all
night for this stuff.

39:45.342 --> 39:46.173
Let her talk.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.006
And that goes for you too.

39:47.008 --> 39:48.548
Both of you, excuse me.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.423
The Martins that live to the right of you?

39:53.425 --> 39:56.383
Well Mrs. Martin, Cathy,
Don's wife, and myself,

39:56.385 --> 39:59.833
we wanted to know what was
happening in those parties.

39:59.835 --> 40:04.835
Um, and I'm not very proud
of this, but, one night

40:05.995 --> 40:08.913
we were looking out through
the main bedroom window.

40:08.915 --> 40:11.923
As God is my witness, we
saw a circle of people

40:11.925 --> 40:14.623
wearing black robes with hoods on them

40:14.625 --> 40:18.633
and they were having what
appeared to be a seance.

40:18.635 --> 40:21.503
And at one point, one of
them looked dead on at me.

40:21.505 --> 40:23.514
Penny will you just
get to the damn point?

40:23.516 --> 40:25.182
Just tell him.

40:25.184 --> 40:26.015
Tell him.

40:26.017 --> 40:26.850
I am.

40:29.365 --> 40:31.153
There was no way they
could've seen us because we

40:31.155 --> 40:33.493
were in the dark, but
that was enough to get us

40:33.495 --> 40:34.833
to stop doing that.

40:34.835 --> 40:38.133
Anyway, shortly, they sold the house.

40:38.135 --> 40:41.463
That's when the Harris's moved in.

40:41.465 --> 40:46.465
Now Michael, for the really
freaky part, let me tell you,

40:47.965 --> 40:50.043
the day that they moved in...

40:50.045 --> 40:51.133
- As soon as...
- I'll get it.

40:51.135 --> 40:52.403
Oh.

40:52.405 --> 40:53.873
I wonder who that could be.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.535
More surprises probably, huh?

41:04.635 --> 41:07.085
- Penny, look who's here.
- Yeah?

41:10.095 --> 41:12.193
Hi, I'm Penny,

41:12.195 --> 41:16.345
and, um, well with were, um...

41:17.565 --> 41:20.373
Your husband here was saying
so many lovely things about you

41:20.375 --> 41:21.763
I was beginning to think maybe you could

41:21.765 --> 41:24.143
walk on water.

41:24.145 --> 41:26.313
I think you may have me
confused for somebody else.

41:26.315 --> 41:28.103
There's definitely a problem.

41:28.105 --> 41:28.936
Sorry.

41:28.938 --> 41:30.263
Well this is Don.

41:30.265 --> 41:31.813
He's one of our neighbors.

41:31.815 --> 41:34.223
He used to teach theology
at the university.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.743
Sweetheart, is everything okay?

41:36.745 --> 41:37.983
Yeah.

41:37.985 --> 41:40.203
Maddy's toilet is stopped
up, and I think it's

41:40.205 --> 41:41.823
going to overflow.

41:41.825 --> 41:44.978
I thought that's why
we had Craigslist.

41:46.283 --> 41:48.893
Oh anyway, we were asking
your plumber here if perhaps

41:48.895 --> 41:50.083
maybe sometime next week you'd like

41:50.085 --> 41:51.572
to come to dinner, and...

42:08.455 --> 42:11.943
Uh, so, Friday maybe?

42:11.945 --> 42:13.858
Okay, six o'clock?

43:12.374 --> 43:14.707
So did you fix the toilet?

43:16.865 --> 43:18.882
Toilet's fine.

43:18.884 --> 43:20.134
Wasn't clogged.

43:21.574 --> 43:23.512
Oh you must have a magic touch.

43:28.585 --> 43:31.485
Did you know that the original
owner died in this house?

43:58.605 --> 43:59.438
Hey.

44:05.105 --> 44:06.228
Hi Mrs. Ryan.

44:07.915 --> 44:09.928
Hi Nic, how are you this evening?

44:12.415 --> 44:14.015
What's with your mom?

44:15.299 --> 44:16.148
What do you mean?

44:17.285 --> 44:20.023
Well your mom called me Nic,
she's never called me that.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.298
And she was rude.

44:23.885 --> 44:26.928
Remember when I told you
she hasn't been acting right?

44:28.005 --> 44:28.838
Yeah.

44:29.852 --> 44:32.243
And I'm sorry I sort of blew you off.

44:32.245 --> 44:33.803
It's okay.

44:33.805 --> 44:35.655
But this is what I was talking about.

44:37.425 --> 44:40.393
Well what does your
dad say about all this?

44:40.395 --> 44:42.033
Oh I don't know.

44:42.035 --> 44:43.188
You know my dad.

44:47.715 --> 44:49.087
Do you think this has anything to do

44:49.089 --> 44:52.083
with the Ouija board your
dad found in the basement?

44:52.085 --> 44:53.273
No.

44:53.275 --> 44:55.873
Why would you say that?

44:55.875 --> 44:58.498
Well, spirits,

45:00.465 --> 45:03.753
or rather demons, they
attach to Ouija boards.

45:03.755 --> 45:06.083
Have you been playing with it?

45:06.085 --> 45:07.513
Hell no.

45:07.515 --> 45:10.128
- Well what about your sister?
- How would I know?

45:13.458 --> 45:15.533
Well what about your mom?

45:15.535 --> 45:16.983
No.

45:16.985 --> 45:18.773
My mom wouldn't do that.

45:18.775 --> 45:21.973
- Are you sure?
- Yes Nicole, I'm sure.

45:21.975 --> 45:24.583
Stop asking me about that
stupid board, all right?

45:24.585 --> 45:27.088
You're supposed to be here
for homework, remember?

45:28.615 --> 45:31.346
Okay, I was just trying to help.

45:31.348 --> 45:33.298
Well that kind of help, I don't need.

49:04.242 --> 49:05.075
Mom?

49:07.699 --> 49:08.532
Dad?

50:56.655 --> 50:57.926
Maddy, honey, are you okay?

50:57.928 --> 51:01.883
It's okay, Maddy.

51:01.885 --> 51:03.708
I could hear you all the way in my room.

51:05.765 --> 51:07.272
Did you have another nightmare?

51:07.274 --> 51:08.980
I wasn't having a nightmare.

51:08.982 --> 51:10.668
- I was, I...
- Yes, Maddy,

51:12.475 --> 51:13.538
what was it?

51:15.335 --> 51:18.285
I think she probably had one
of her silly nightmares again.

51:20.175 --> 51:22.276
It's okay, honey.

51:22.278 --> 51:23.878
Please don't leave me, daddy,

51:23.880 --> 51:26.373
please don't leave me.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.023
I'm right here, it's okay.

51:28.025 --> 51:29.175
I'm not going anywhere.

51:30.435 --> 51:32.615
I'm here as long as you need me.

51:39.345 --> 51:40.178
Where were you?

51:46.665 --> 51:50.778
You need to go back to bed.

52:35.395 --> 52:36.863
Yeah?

52:36.865 --> 52:40.943
Hello, um, is this um,
Father Robert Crespin

52:40.945 --> 52:42.663
Yes, Father Bob.

52:42.665 --> 52:43.968
Father Bob, yes.

52:45.075 --> 52:46.447
My neighbor gave me your card...

52:46.449 --> 52:49.349
Bill Lawford?

52:49.351 --> 52:51.163
How did you know it was Bill?

52:51.165 --> 52:54.223
I asked him to give it to the new owner.

52:54.225 --> 52:56.903
I'd like to come bless
your house, meet your wife.

52:56.905 --> 52:58.923
Yes, um, Katie.

52:58.925 --> 53:00.423
How is your wife?

53:00.425 --> 53:03.063
I don't know, um, she hasn't
really been herself lately.

53:03.065 --> 53:03.898
Um...

53:05.915 --> 53:08.393
Can you come over for
dinner tomorrow night?

53:08.395 --> 53:10.403
I suppose
tomorrow's soon enough.

53:10.405 --> 53:11.548
Let's say seven?

53:12.671 --> 53:14.019
Seven?

53:14.021 --> 53:14.854
All right.

53:54.995 --> 53:56.745
Trying to give me a heart attack?

53:59.875 --> 54:03.823
I forgot to tell you, Father
Bob from the local dioses

54:03.825 --> 54:05.875
is coming over for dinner tomorrow night.

54:08.305 --> 54:09.533
Why?

54:09.535 --> 54:11.263
What business does he have here?

54:11.265 --> 54:13.508
He's coming over to
give the house a blessing.

54:16.037 --> 54:17.128
What's with the attitude?

54:17.965 --> 54:19.393
A blessing?

54:19.395 --> 54:20.668
We don't need a blessing.

54:21.555 --> 54:24.273
This house is fine as is,
and I'm pretty sure that

54:24.275 --> 54:26.673
this Father Bob character
has better things

54:26.675 --> 54:29.453
to do with his time.

54:29.455 --> 54:31.696
What are you talking about?

54:31.698 --> 54:33.228
This is what priests do.

55:44.965 --> 55:47.373
Geez, dad,
it's Saturday morning.

55:47.375 --> 55:49.128
Why are you up so early?

55:50.169 --> 55:52.292
Could say the same thing about you.

55:53.402 --> 55:55.468
I decided we needed a road trip.

55:56.415 --> 55:57.963
Oh joy.

55:57.965 --> 55:59.813
Don't sound so excited.

55:59.815 --> 56:02.328
Who is making all the noise down here?

56:03.515 --> 56:06.353
Dad's planning a family road trip.

56:06.355 --> 56:07.623
Great.

56:07.625 --> 56:09.453
Last time I got car sick
and threw up all over

56:09.455 --> 56:10.830
the back seat.

56:10.832 --> 56:12.933
Ugh, don't remind me.

56:12.935 --> 56:15.453
I got stuck having to
clean it up, remember?

56:15.455 --> 56:17.105
Dad, do I have to go?

56:18.415 --> 56:20.303
Of course, why wouldn't you?

56:20.305 --> 56:22.643
I woke up with terrible cramps,

56:22.645 --> 56:24.973
and I have to, you know,
work on this homework project

56:24.975 --> 56:26.408
that's due Monday.

56:27.245 --> 56:28.403
Seriously Kristen?

56:28.405 --> 56:29.698
Yeah, seriously.

56:30.995 --> 56:31.826
Fine.

56:31.828 --> 56:33.133
Dad, that's not fair.

56:33.135 --> 56:35.220
It's totally fair.

56:40.145 --> 56:42.333
- What's wrong sweetheart?
- Talk with dad.

56:42.335 --> 56:43.985
He's planning a family road trip.

56:46.175 --> 56:50.443
Michael, what in the
world is going on in here?

56:50.445 --> 56:54.023
We are long overdue
for a family outing, so,

56:54.025 --> 56:55.875
thought I'd put some snacks together,

56:57.245 --> 57:00.228
and we would take a road
trip up to San Diego.

57:01.837 --> 57:06.263
Oh, but I've got so many
things to do in this house.

57:06.265 --> 57:07.983
No buts about it.

57:07.985 --> 57:10.408
The car leaves in an
hour, and you're with it.

57:12.885 --> 57:14.123
All right.

57:14.125 --> 57:15.423
All right.

57:15.425 --> 57:16.325
I'll go get ready.

57:30.735 --> 57:32.043
Maddy, do me a favor.

57:32.045 --> 57:33.713
Will you go tell your
mom we're ready to go?

57:33.715 --> 57:34.548
Yeah.

57:40.535 --> 57:41.368
Mom?

57:51.845 --> 57:54.158
Um, dad said we're ready to go.

57:57.345 --> 57:58.548
I need to stay here.

58:14.595 --> 58:16.583
Dad, you need to talk to mom.

58:16.585 --> 58:17.473
Why?

58:17.475 --> 58:20.298
She said she can't
go, she needs to stay.

58:21.505 --> 58:25.425
What the hell?

58:28.403 --> 58:31.633
What the hell is going on here?

58:32.468 --> 58:33.788
How about a little privacy?

58:35.623 --> 58:38.318
I'm gettin' real sick
and tired of this bullshit!

58:38.320 --> 58:40.758
You have 10 minutes to
get your ass downstairs!

58:41.945 --> 58:46.113
Kristen!

58:46.115 --> 58:47.703
We're gettin' ready to leave.

58:47.705 --> 58:49.603
Get the downstairs organized!

58:49.605 --> 58:51.943
Father Bob's coming over for dinner.

58:51.945 --> 58:54.008
I thought you canceled that appointment.

58:55.607 --> 58:56.883
Of course I didn't.

58:56.885 --> 58:58.535
That'd be the height of rudeness.

59:26.995 --> 59:27.855
So...

59:29.205 --> 59:31.768
Why isn't Kristen coming again?

59:32.655 --> 59:33.873
Uh, she has cramps.

59:33.875 --> 59:35.708
She has a homework
assignment due on Monday.

01:00:03.387 --> 01:00:05.603
You know what, turn around.

01:00:05.605 --> 01:00:08.843
We need to go back, I need my phone.

01:00:08.845 --> 01:00:10.463
Are you kidding, it's Saturday.

01:00:10.465 --> 01:00:11.738
You'll be fine without it.

01:00:12.945 --> 01:00:13.778
Michael.

01:00:15.432 --> 01:00:18.208
I said I need my cell phone.

01:00:41.482 --> 01:00:43.110
It's okay.

01:00:43.112 --> 01:00:44.712
You can use mine if you need to.

01:00:47.405 --> 01:00:48.238
Michael.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:52.568
I said I needed to get my cell phone.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:12.568
Michael.

01:01:13.562 --> 01:01:15.088
I said I need my phone.

01:01:39.772 --> 01:01:42.383
I said I need my cell phone, Michael!

01:01:42.385 --> 01:01:43.835
Fucking turn this car around.

01:01:51.655 --> 01:01:52.842
Okay.

01:01:52.844 --> 01:01:53.677
Okay.

01:01:54.675 --> 01:01:56.896
Just stay off me.

01:03:30.305 --> 01:03:34.173
You should know better than to be going

01:03:34.175 --> 01:03:35.725
through my personal belongings.

01:04:07.115 --> 01:04:09.573
Holy cow, somebody's been busy.

01:04:09.575 --> 01:04:10.453
Boy I'll say.

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:12.313
This looks terrific.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.303
Thanks.

01:04:13.305 --> 01:04:15.673
Well, I figured you guys
would be running late,

01:04:15.675 --> 01:04:17.773
and I know mom would start stressing out,

01:04:17.775 --> 01:04:19.343
so I thought why not?

01:04:19.345 --> 01:04:21.393
Well thank you.

01:04:21.395 --> 01:04:23.503
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

01:04:23.505 --> 01:04:24.336
Nothing really.

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.733
I've already made the
pasta, the marinara sauce,

01:04:26.735 --> 01:04:29.143
and the last thing to do was the salad.

01:04:29.145 --> 01:04:32.795
Okay well, I'm gonna go
upstairs and take a shower

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.563
and change and get ready.

01:04:35.565 --> 01:04:39.053
Michael, be sure to get some wine.

01:04:39.055 --> 01:04:41.423
You know how much priests love their wine.

01:04:41.425 --> 01:04:42.258
Will do.

01:04:50.715 --> 01:04:52.613
Father Bob, welcome.

01:04:52.615 --> 01:04:54.030
Hello.

01:04:54.032 --> 01:04:54.863
Nice to meet you.

01:04:54.865 --> 01:04:57.313
Glad it worked out,
us having you come over.

01:04:57.315 --> 01:05:00.574
Me too, I uh, look forward to tonight.

01:05:00.576 --> 01:05:02.178
Look forward to meeting your wife.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:04.913
- Did you find us okay?
- Oh yeah.

01:05:04.915 --> 01:05:05.908
Yeah, easy.

01:05:06.895 --> 01:05:08.703
Knew where you were.

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:10.733
Father Bob, this is my wife Katie.

01:05:10.735 --> 01:05:11.566
Hello.

01:05:11.568 --> 01:05:13.083
Our daughters Kristen, Maddy.

01:05:13.085 --> 01:05:14.243
Hello.

01:05:14.245 --> 01:05:17.263
Oh, your home looks so
comfortable.

01:05:17.265 --> 01:05:18.373
Lived in.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:19.462
I love it.

01:05:19.464 --> 01:05:20.482
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:05:21.515 --> 01:05:24.468
Please, make yourself at home.

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:25.301
I will.

01:05:25.303 --> 01:05:26.723
Can I get you a glass of wine?

01:05:26.725 --> 01:05:28.363
Yes, that'd be nice.

01:05:28.365 --> 01:05:30.013
Thanks.

01:05:30.015 --> 01:05:32.183
You know, I've been here
once before when the

01:05:32.185 --> 01:05:33.198
Harris's owned it.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.023
Did you know that?

01:05:36.025 --> 01:05:37.173
Really?

01:05:37.175 --> 01:05:40.223
Uh no, um, but I understand that you did.

01:05:40.225 --> 01:05:41.298
Yes, I did.

01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:45.163
I spent some time counseling Mrs. Harris.

01:05:45.165 --> 01:05:46.813
- May I ask what...
- Dinner's ready.

01:05:46.815 --> 01:05:48.738
Let's not let the food get cold.

01:05:49.775 --> 01:05:50.608
Oh thank you.

01:05:52.555 --> 01:05:53.743
Please.

01:05:53.745 --> 01:05:55.283
Feel free to serve yourselves.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.628
Oh, okay.

01:05:57.984 --> 01:06:00.234
Well it all looks so
nice here, look at this.

01:06:01.495 --> 01:06:03.903
Father Bob, will you
please bless the food?

01:06:03.905 --> 01:06:05.128
Sure, Michael.

01:06:11.965 --> 01:06:15.965
Uh, in the Father, the
son, and the Holy Spirit.

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:20.513
Bless us, oh Lord, in these thy gifts,

01:06:20.515 --> 01:06:22.883
which we are about to receive.

01:06:22.885 --> 01:06:26.538
From thy bounty, to Christ our Lord, amen.

01:06:29.735 --> 01:06:32.358
Well, everything looks so delicious.

01:06:34.045 --> 01:06:35.893
Uh please, help yourself.

01:06:35.895 --> 01:06:36.728
Thank you.

01:06:37.655 --> 01:06:39.503
Kristen deserves all the credit.

01:06:39.505 --> 01:06:41.433
She put all this together.

01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:44.183
Oh, you did a great job.

01:06:44.185 --> 01:06:47.518
Let me guess, you take
after your mother, right?

01:06:48.575 --> 01:06:49.408
Thanks.

01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:53.458
Katie?

01:06:54.639 --> 01:06:57.139
It's so nice of you and
Michael to invite me over.

01:06:57.995 --> 01:07:00.888
I'd like to invite you to church.

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:11.623
Oh well, I've just been
busy working on this house

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:15.158
so much I haven't had
time for anything else.

01:07:16.834 --> 01:07:20.828
Well, everything looks
terrific around here.

01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:22.793
Hm.

01:07:22.795 --> 01:07:27.358
Hopefully it means we'll see you soon.

01:07:31.975 --> 01:07:33.473
Oh I don't know.

01:07:33.475 --> 01:07:35.338
It seems something's always going on.

01:07:36.615 --> 01:07:37.448
Really?

01:07:38.415 --> 01:07:39.248
Like what?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.800
What do you mean, Katie?

01:07:47.175 --> 01:07:52.003
Well, like I already said,

01:07:52.005 --> 01:07:53.038
this house.

01:07:54.895 --> 01:07:55.818
Can't you see?

01:07:56.765 --> 01:07:58.608
It requires all of my attention.

01:08:00.765 --> 01:08:01.598
Of course.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.108
Besides the house,

01:08:07.195 --> 01:08:11.068
what else do you do?

01:08:12.058 --> 01:08:13.928
What do you mean what else do I do?

01:08:15.145 --> 01:08:17.247
And why so many questions directed at me?

01:08:18.564 --> 01:08:21.415
There are three other people
sitting here in plain sight.

01:08:24.948 --> 01:08:26.020
Well, my apologies, I
didn't mean to offend you...

01:08:26.022 --> 01:08:27.828
I'm just busy, all right?

01:08:30.015 --> 01:08:32.287
Why is that so hard for you to understand?

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:54.518
Dad, may I be excused?

01:08:55.607 --> 01:08:56.439
Me, too?

01:08:57.462 --> 01:08:58.295
All right.

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:12.365
Why did you take so
long to call me Michael?

01:09:15.366 --> 01:09:16.973
I don't know.

01:09:16.975 --> 01:09:18.375
Just sort of crept up on me.

01:09:20.215 --> 01:09:22.165
Well the main thing is you called me.

01:09:23.314 --> 01:09:24.148
Right.

01:09:26.984 --> 01:09:27.817
So now what?

01:09:29.245 --> 01:09:31.545
Well I'm not gonna try
to scare you Michael.

01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:34.718
What do you mean try to scare me?

01:09:36.285 --> 01:09:40.423
Let me explain a little
bit to you about demons.

01:09:40.425 --> 01:09:42.714
Demons?

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:44.466
I never said anything about demons.

01:09:45.545 --> 01:09:46.377
Michael.

01:09:47.365 --> 01:09:50.398
In instances where an
oppressive feeling is present,

01:09:51.635 --> 01:09:56.143
it's suggests that there may
be some type of involvement

01:09:56.145 --> 01:09:57.188
with a demon.

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:02.673
Are you trying to tell
me that you think that

01:10:02.675 --> 01:10:05.418
my wife is possessed by a demon?

01:10:11.495 --> 01:10:13.043
There is no way Katie's possessed.

01:10:13.045 --> 01:10:13.878
No way.

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:16.513
I'm gonna go check on her.

01:10:16.515 --> 01:10:17.565
Mind if I join you?

01:10:23.535 --> 01:10:24.368
Katie?

01:10:25.236 --> 01:10:26.069
You all right?

01:10:27.235 --> 01:10:29.043
Who were you talking to?

01:10:29.045 --> 01:10:29.958
A friend.

01:10:31.495 --> 01:10:32.523
I don't see anybody here.

01:10:32.525 --> 01:10:33.358
What friend?

01:10:36.215 --> 01:10:37.698
Where is your friend, Katie?

01:10:39.255 --> 01:10:40.088
Everywhere.

01:10:43.515 --> 01:10:45.188
Oh please.

01:10:46.395 --> 01:10:48.545
Don't act like you're so surprised

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:53.523
Okay.

01:10:53.525 --> 01:10:55.703
How would you like for me to act?

01:10:55.705 --> 01:10:58.918
We both know you're in
over your head, don't we?

01:11:00.075 --> 01:11:03.593
You have that same goofy
blank look on your face

01:11:03.595 --> 01:11:04.568
when you were 12.

01:11:06.052 --> 01:11:06.885
Remember?

01:11:08.255 --> 01:11:10.528
I'm no longer that 12-year-old boy.

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.112
Sure you are.

01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:20.973
Inside you're every bit
that scared little boy,

01:11:20.975 --> 01:11:22.398
that wets his pants.

01:11:23.835 --> 01:11:25.235
That's where you're wrong.

01:11:27.215 --> 01:11:28.638
Who's inside you Katie?

01:11:31.355 --> 01:11:33.405
You know who's inside me, preacher boy.

01:11:45.985 --> 01:11:48.188
So you think you're a
grown man now, Bobby?

01:11:54.195 --> 01:11:55.648
Is it just be, boys?

01:11:56.855 --> 01:12:00.708
But who else is ready for some cake?

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:06.488
Cake.

01:12:07.825 --> 01:12:08.698
Cake.

01:12:10.285 --> 01:12:11.118
Cake.

01:12:18.615 --> 01:12:20.393
Where have you two been?

01:12:20.395 --> 01:12:21.988
I've bee waiting and waiting.

01:12:23.345 --> 01:12:26.353
Well Michael took me on
a lovely tour of your home

01:12:26.355 --> 01:12:30.643
and somewhere along the
way, we must've got lost.

01:12:30.645 --> 01:12:32.753
Yeah, we just seemed to
lose track of time, didn't we?

01:12:32.755 --> 01:12:35.488
Yes, speaking of time,
it is getting a bit late.

01:12:37.015 --> 01:12:39.163
I think it's about time I get goin'.

01:12:39.165 --> 01:12:40.203
So soon?

01:12:40.205 --> 01:12:41.923
You haven't had any cake.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:46.093
Well, no thank you, I'll
take a rain check on the cake.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:46.928
Good night.

01:12:48.455 --> 01:12:50.855
Michael, thank you so
much for inviting me over.

01:12:52.502 --> 01:12:54.133
It was lovely to meet your family.

01:12:54.135 --> 01:12:55.235
You're most welcome.

01:12:56.424 --> 01:12:57.563
You have a good night.

01:12:57.565 --> 01:13:01.473
Mrs. Ryan, I look forward
to seeing you again.

01:13:01.475 --> 01:13:02.308
Good night.

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:17.858
So.

01:13:19.485 --> 01:13:22.795
Did we pass your stupid, little test?

01:14:30.252 --> 01:14:31.085
Katie?

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:19.083
Katie?

01:15:29.329 --> 01:15:30.162
Katie.

01:15:39.576 --> 01:15:40.409
Katie?

01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:47.232
Katie!

01:15:55.204 --> 01:15:56.037
Katie.

01:17:22.845 --> 01:17:24.863
It's about time you got up.

01:17:24.865 --> 01:17:26.883
I was afraid I was gonna
have to get a search party

01:17:26.885 --> 01:17:28.393
out for you.

01:17:28.395 --> 01:17:30.593
Come and join us with
some blueberry pancakes.

01:17:30.595 --> 01:17:32.633
Super yummy daddy-o.

01:17:32.635 --> 01:17:34.485
Yeah, mom outdid herself.

01:17:40.475 --> 01:17:41.338
Excuse me.

01:17:43.045 --> 01:17:43.878
Yeah, me too.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:06.915
I need to talk to you.

01:18:08.265 --> 01:18:09.948
Okay, what's up?

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.300
What do you remember about last night?

01:18:17.915 --> 01:18:19.733
Is this a joke?

01:18:19.735 --> 01:18:21.818
No, it's not a joke.

01:18:28.435 --> 01:18:30.748
If you wanna ask me something, Michael,

01:18:32.146 --> 01:18:33.468
then just ask me.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.445
All right.

01:18:39.322 --> 01:18:42.063
Do you remember me finding you last night

01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:43.848
on the basement stairs?

01:18:46.575 --> 01:18:47.438
Michael.

01:18:48.585 --> 01:18:50.583
Quit playing around.

01:18:50.585 --> 01:18:51.988
It's not a bit funny.

01:18:54.865 --> 01:18:55.698
Katie.

01:18:56.805 --> 01:19:00.108
I'm not playing around.

01:19:02.495 --> 01:19:03.405
What do you mean

01:19:05.145 --> 01:19:08.393
finding me downstairs?

01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:10.938
I mean exactly what I said.

01:19:12.235 --> 01:19:15.423
I found you at 2:30 in the morning

01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:17.988
standing guard on the basement stairs.

01:19:20.521 --> 01:19:24.713
You're making this up.

01:19:24.715 --> 01:19:27.203
Like hell I am!

01:19:27.205 --> 01:19:30.223
Geez, are you both deaf?

01:19:30.225 --> 01:19:31.408
- Are we what?
- Deaf.

01:19:34.265 --> 01:19:36.298
No, Kristen, we're not deaf.

01:19:40.285 --> 01:19:41.585
I need to ask you favor.

01:19:43.885 --> 01:19:45.018
Can I interview you?

01:19:46.595 --> 01:19:47.426
Interview me?

01:19:47.428 --> 01:19:48.259
Why?

01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.933
It's for my econ class.

01:19:49.935 --> 01:19:51.848
I need to interview a business person.

01:19:54.985 --> 01:19:55.818
Fine.

01:19:58.765 --> 01:20:00.915
I gotta take care of
a couple emails first.

01:20:10.725 --> 01:20:11.625
What's with dad?

01:20:20.925 --> 01:20:23.103
Hope you like your coffee black.

01:20:23.105 --> 01:20:24.253
I do.

01:20:24.255 --> 01:20:25.088
Thanks.

01:20:31.174 --> 01:20:32.007
No thanks.

01:20:37.765 --> 01:20:38.598
So...

01:20:41.661 --> 01:20:43.813
I need to talk to about last night.

01:20:43.815 --> 01:20:45.463
After you left.

01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:47.065
That's not gonna be necessary.

01:20:48.185 --> 01:20:50.783
Your suspicions and concerns with Katie

01:20:50.785 --> 01:20:52.972
are not unfounded.

01:20:53.825 --> 01:20:55.432
Last night was really somethin'.

01:21:00.525 --> 01:21:01.445
What do I do?

01:21:05.135 --> 01:21:07.185
Have you heard of deliverance ministry?

01:21:08.559 --> 01:21:10.233
Deliverance what?

01:21:10.235 --> 01:21:12.485
That's not surprising,
most people haven't.

01:21:14.285 --> 01:21:16.673
They focus on chasing demons.

01:21:16.675 --> 01:21:19.578
Demons, father, not this again.

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:20.828
I don't know about demons.

01:21:24.985 --> 01:21:26.103
Michael.

01:21:26.105 --> 01:21:28.468
You know there's something
going on here, right?

01:21:43.375 --> 01:21:46.755
Look, I have a homework
assignment for you.

01:21:47.762 --> 01:21:50.208
I want you to read up
on deliverance ministry.

01:21:52.035 --> 01:21:52.868
All right.

01:21:54.816 --> 01:21:57.706
I'm gonna have to see
Katie one more time.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:59.858
I don't know how I'm
gonna pull that off.

01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:09.643
It's Kristen, my daughter.

01:22:09.645 --> 01:22:10.863
It's about Katie.

01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:12.365
- I gotta take this.
- Michael.

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:15.025
Don't forget to do your homework.

01:22:47.015 --> 01:22:48.215
Where's mom?

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:51.663
Upstairs, I guess.

01:22:51.665 --> 01:22:52.498
Or in her room.

01:22:55.985 --> 01:22:57.040
What did you want to talk to me about?

01:22:57.042 --> 01:23:00.268
You know yesterday,
when you guys were gone?

01:23:01.805 --> 01:23:04.533
- When we went to San Diego?
- Yes.

01:23:04.535 --> 01:23:06.903
Well, I'm not proud of what I did,

01:23:06.905 --> 01:23:09.353
and I don't want you to overreact,

01:23:09.355 --> 01:23:11.355
but I went through some of mom's things.

01:23:12.815 --> 01:23:14.357
Kristen, you know better.

01:23:14.359 --> 01:23:16.243
I know, I know it was wrong.

01:23:16.245 --> 01:23:18.033
But I had to know.

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.553
Know what?

01:23:19.555 --> 01:23:22.673
Dad, mom was using the Ouija board,

01:23:22.675 --> 01:23:24.298
and I found a bottle of vodka.

01:23:26.665 --> 01:23:28.153
I know.

01:23:28.155 --> 01:23:29.643
Well about the Ouija board.

01:23:29.645 --> 01:23:30.478
You do?

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:33.303
I found her with it, the other day.

01:23:33.305 --> 01:23:35.033
She was using it.

01:23:35.035 --> 01:23:37.598
And then when I went to
throw it out, it was gone.

01:23:38.675 --> 01:23:39.508
So now what?

01:23:43.325 --> 01:23:45.823
Father Bob needs to see her again, but,

01:23:45.825 --> 01:23:47.488
I'm not sure how to work that out.

01:23:48.625 --> 01:23:51.813
What if I get Nicole to
come over with the idea

01:23:51.815 --> 01:23:54.023
of Father Bob helping her with some sort

01:23:54.025 --> 01:23:55.208
of personal problem?

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:02.253
What are you
two so busy talking about?

01:24:02.255 --> 01:24:05.063
Kristen was just telling me that um,

01:24:05.065 --> 01:24:07.758
her friend Nicole wants
to talk with Father Bob.

01:24:11.145 --> 01:24:11.978
Oh really?

01:24:16.795 --> 01:24:17.626
What's wrong?

01:24:17.628 --> 01:24:20.168
I promised her I wouldn't say anything.

01:24:22.335 --> 01:24:24.003
She better not be pregnant.

01:24:24.005 --> 01:24:25.288
Mom, please.

01:24:26.965 --> 01:24:28.723
So what time were you thinking?

01:24:28.725 --> 01:24:31.720
Tonight, if Father Bob can make it work.

01:24:31.722 --> 01:24:33.022
But the sooner the better.

01:24:37.265 --> 01:24:38.843
You know what I've been thinking?

01:24:38.845 --> 01:24:40.033
What's that?

01:24:40.035 --> 01:24:42.298
I think we need to get away.

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:45.533
- Just the two of us.
- Really?

01:24:45.535 --> 01:24:47.123
Yes.

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:47.958
I do.

01:24:49.425 --> 01:24:50.338
This weekend?

01:24:51.365 --> 01:24:52.265
What do you think?

01:24:53.406 --> 01:24:54.239
Sure.

01:24:55.119 --> 01:24:57.260
That'd be great.

01:25:14.085 --> 01:25:14.916
Hi.

01:25:14.918 --> 01:25:16.313
Hey.

01:25:16.315 --> 01:25:19.293
So did you come back to
help us move more boxes?

01:25:19.295 --> 01:25:22.008
Actually no, I'm here about the rats.

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:24.763
Your mom called us.

01:25:24.765 --> 01:25:26.183
Oh, okay.

01:25:26.185 --> 01:25:27.573
I'll get my dad.

01:25:27.575 --> 01:25:28.538
Dad!

01:25:29.765 --> 01:25:32.123
I'm sorry, what was your name?

01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:33.873
Adam.

01:25:33.875 --> 01:25:35.768
Dad, Adam's here.

01:25:37.155 --> 01:25:37.988
Who's here?

01:25:39.445 --> 01:25:41.433
Oh, hi.

01:25:41.435 --> 01:25:42.485
What a nice surprise.

01:25:43.975 --> 01:25:47.543
Our apologies, your wife called us, uh,

01:25:47.545 --> 01:25:50.195
like a while back, but it
slipped through the cracks.

01:25:51.175 --> 01:25:52.683
- About the rats.
- Oh.

01:25:52.685 --> 01:25:55.773
So I'm here, woo, for
the free inspection.

01:25:55.775 --> 01:25:56.606
Oh.

01:25:56.608 --> 01:25:58.443
Well, where would you like to start?

01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:00.398
I'd like to start
low and work my way up.

01:26:02.075 --> 01:26:02.935
Okay then.

01:26:04.645 --> 01:26:07.348
Well, um, here's our dungeon.

01:26:08.728 --> 01:26:09.578
I mean, basement.

01:26:11.595 --> 01:26:13.695
I really don't like basements, Mr. Ryan.

01:26:15.195 --> 01:26:16.373
That was a joke.

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:20.015
I'll take it from here.

01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:27.490
Like what you see?

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:31.531
Hey, I know what it is.

01:27:31.533 --> 01:27:33.083
- How'd it go?
- Oh well good, you know what?

01:27:33.085 --> 01:27:35.423
Uh, I got no write ups but I
gotta go do another inspection.

01:27:35.425 --> 01:27:36.964
Watch your step.

01:27:36.966 --> 01:27:39.093
You know, it's all right Mr. Ryan

01:27:39.095 --> 01:27:40.568
don't worry about it, it's fine.

01:27:49.045 --> 01:27:50.018
That was Adam.

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:54.098
The mover who gave us
a free rat inspection.

01:27:58.515 --> 01:27:59.913
Where were ya?

01:27:59.915 --> 01:28:02.798
Oh I was in the kitchen,
eating strawberries.

01:28:05.567 --> 01:28:06.528
What's that on your lip?

01:28:07.795 --> 01:28:11.388
Oh, that's probably
some ripened strawberries.

01:28:12.677 --> 01:28:13.510
Mm.

01:28:17.515 --> 01:28:18.608
Father Bob called.

01:28:20.165 --> 01:28:22.678
He's okay to meet Nicole here at eight.

01:28:33.345 --> 01:28:36.768
I know it sounds crazy when
you say it out loud like that.

01:28:39.535 --> 01:28:40.368
Like what?

01:28:42.055 --> 01:28:44.793
Just get here at eight, and
use the outside staircase.

01:28:44.795 --> 01:28:45.628
Okay?

01:28:57.768 --> 01:28:58.951
Father Bob.

01:28:58.953 --> 01:28:59.786
Come in.

01:29:07.195 --> 01:29:08.626
So, how are you going to do this?

01:29:08.628 --> 01:29:10.813
Did you do your
homework like I asked you?

01:29:10.815 --> 01:29:12.093
Yeah, I did.

01:29:12.095 --> 01:29:13.473
Do you want me to get Nicole?

01:29:13.475 --> 01:29:14.793
No, no, that won't be necessary.

01:29:14.795 --> 01:29:16.403
I would suggest you have Kristen take

01:29:16.405 --> 01:29:19.593
Nicole and Maddy out the house
and you'll call 'em later.

01:29:19.595 --> 01:29:20.935
- Okay.
- All right.

01:29:31.705 --> 01:29:33.505
Nice collection, isn't it?

01:29:35.645 --> 01:29:36.498
Yes it is.

01:29:39.449 --> 01:29:41.233
You look tired Father.

01:29:41.235 --> 01:29:42.098
Do you mind if I sit?

01:29:42.935 --> 01:29:44.078
Suit yourself.

01:29:45.978 --> 01:29:47.395
Please join me.

01:29:54.625 --> 01:29:56.493
What's bothering you?

01:29:56.495 --> 01:29:57.648
Bothering me?

01:29:59.815 --> 01:30:02.033
Shouldn't you be asking Nicole?

01:30:02.035 --> 01:30:02.988
Soon enough.

01:30:04.815 --> 01:30:05.655
You just seem

01:30:07.925 --> 01:30:09.803
sort of agitated.

01:30:09.805 --> 01:30:12.163
I'd prefer to be left alone.

01:30:12.165 --> 01:30:13.538
I'm here to help you.

01:30:14.739 --> 01:30:15.572
Help me?

01:30:16.852 --> 01:30:20.103
You can by leaving us alone.

01:30:20.105 --> 01:30:21.018
You should go.

01:30:25.845 --> 01:30:27.093
Who's us Katie?

01:30:27.095 --> 01:30:29.293
Stop playing games.

01:30:29.295 --> 01:30:31.843
Just because you're all religious

01:30:31.845 --> 01:30:36.073
doesn't give you the right
to try to change our lives.

01:30:36.075 --> 01:30:37.613
We're fine.

01:30:37.615 --> 01:30:40.888
Every evil spirit that hears my voice,

01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:45.239
I command you, in the name
of Jesus, to tell the truth.

01:30:45.241 --> 01:30:46.074
Who is us?

01:30:47.745 --> 01:30:52.333
I command you, in the name of
Jesus, to tell me your name.

01:30:52.335 --> 01:30:53.548
Who's us, Katie?

01:30:55.190 --> 01:30:57.238
You know quite well who us is.

01:30:59.355 --> 01:31:01.172
Is the Holy Spirit with you?

01:31:02.765 --> 01:31:06.023
I come against every unclean spirit,

01:31:06.025 --> 01:31:07.388
by the blood of the lamb.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.048
You're a child of God, Katie.

01:31:14.075 --> 01:31:18.808
Your body has been sanctified
by the blood of Jesus.

01:31:20.021 --> 01:31:20.854
Katie.

01:31:29.535 --> 01:31:31.538
Oh please, Bobby.

01:31:32.422 --> 01:31:34.993
You don't mind if I call you Bobby, do ya?

01:31:34.995 --> 01:31:36.293
It's kind of sexy.

01:31:36.295 --> 01:31:37.903
I know you like it.

01:31:37.905 --> 01:31:40.343
Or are you gonna tell me that
you got turned out in prison?

01:31:40.345 --> 01:31:42.209
I bet you still appreciate
a nice pair of - -

01:31:42.211 --> 01:31:44.953
- I said I'm talking to Katie.

01:31:44.955 --> 01:31:47.533
Katie's kind of busy
right now, preacher boy.

01:31:47.535 --> 01:31:49.776
I said I'm talking to Katie.

01:31:49.778 --> 01:31:53.223
I remove every unclean spirit
from this person's soul.

01:31:53.225 --> 01:31:56.037
Oh don't go preacher-like on me.

01:31:56.039 --> 01:31:57.533
And I will save Katie from your hell.

01:31:57.535 --> 01:32:00.690
Who do you think you are, God?

01:32:00.692 --> 01:32:02.351
Jesus I know.

01:32:02.353 --> 01:32:04.382
Judas, I really.

01:32:04.384 --> 01:32:05.344
John.

01:32:05.346 --> 01:32:06.883
I'm a servant of the
alpha and the omega,

01:32:06.885 --> 01:32:09.423
the God of this world and all worlds.

01:32:09.425 --> 01:32:13.243
- I'm not leaving!
- Like hell you're not!

01:32:13.245 --> 01:32:16.773
The gospel says that we will arm ourselves

01:32:16.775 --> 01:32:20.233
against spiritual wickedness
with the spirit of God.

01:32:20.235 --> 01:32:23.743
You Katie, you can resist the demon.

01:32:23.745 --> 01:32:26.313
Resist the demon, Katie, I command you,

01:32:26.315 --> 01:32:27.913
in the name of God.

01:32:27.915 --> 01:32:30.783
In the name of God,
Katie, resist the demon.

01:32:30.785 --> 01:32:33.008
Resist him, you can do this Katie.

01:32:34.545 --> 01:32:35.768
Katie, you're all right.

01:32:36.937 --> 01:32:37.776
- I'm so sorry.
- You're alive,

01:32:37.778 --> 01:32:39.493
it's okay Katie.

01:32:39.495 --> 01:32:40.408
It's okay.

01:32:44.555 --> 01:32:46.643
Come on guys, let's go.

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:48.173
Need to step on it.

01:32:48.175 --> 01:32:50.872
Surprise,
surprise, we're always late.

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:56.193
You're not wearing those
shoes to church, young lady.

01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:57.026
But mom...

01:32:57.028 --> 01:32:59.048
Uh uh, no if, ands, or buts.

01:33:00.166 --> 01:33:02.773
- Okay, come on.
- Fine, I'll go change.

01:33:02.775 --> 01:33:04.703
I'll meet you guys in the car.

01:33:04.705 --> 01:33:05.905
We're right behind ya.

01:33:07.435 --> 01:33:08.738
- Michael?
- Yeah?

01:33:09.855 --> 01:33:11.355
- Thank you.
- For what?

01:33:12.945 --> 01:33:14.245
For not giving up on me.

01:33:17.955 --> 01:33:18.788
Of course.

01:33:19.785 --> 01:33:20.928
Love never quits.

01:33:23.055 --> 01:33:25.193
Ugh, we don't have
time for that remember?

01:33:25.195 --> 01:33:26.168
We're in a hurry.

01:34:41.288 --> 01:34:46.288
