WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.041
(opening theme playing)

00:08.000 --> 00:10.041
I mean, as parents,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.041
I think we can all agree

00:10.125 --> 00:13.750
that, you know, two 18-year-olds

00:10.125 --> 00:13.750
getting married is a huge mistake.

00:13.834 --> 00:18.375
Not as big a mistake as me trying parkour,

00:13.834 --> 00:18.375
but, uh, a mistake nonetheless.

00:18.458 --> 00:20.917
We think it's great

00:18.458 --> 00:20.917
these kids got hitched.

00:21.041 --> 00:23.542
Thank you, it means a lot

00:21.041 --> 00:23.542
that someone believes in us.

00:23.625 --> 00:26.125
Who are we to say what makes a family?

00:26.208 --> 00:28.166
I mean, people told us

00:26.208 --> 00:28.166
we would never work,

00:28.250 --> 00:29.625
but they were wrong.

00:29.709 --> 00:30.750
WOMAN: So wrong.

00:30.834 --> 00:32.291
Just because we're brother and sister

00:32.375 --> 00:34.583
doesn't mean that we can't raise

00:32.375 --> 00:34.583
a family together.

00:36.125 --> 00:36.959
You're, uh...

00:37.041 --> 00:39.750
I know what you're thinking.

00:37.041 --> 00:39.750
We don't look anything alike.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.875
Yeah, that's what we're thinking.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.875
Well, when Clementine's dad left me,

00:45.417 --> 00:49.583
Spencer vowed to help me raise the kids,

00:45.417 --> 00:49.583
and he's been there for us ever since.

00:49.667 --> 00:50.875
SPENCER: That's what family does.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.917
When your sister needs you,

00:50.959 --> 00:53.917
you step up and fill the hole.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.041
Oh, and he fills it. And then some.

00:57.709 --> 00:58.959
I love you, Uncle-Dad.

00:59.333 --> 01:02.375
Oh... (laughs) This is so sweet.

01:02.834 --> 01:04.125
Uh, but they're just kids,

01:04.542 --> 01:07.375
so there's no reason

01:04.542 --> 01:07.375
for them to be married.

01:07.709 --> 01:08.625
There is a big reason.

01:08.709 --> 01:10.959
And it's getting bigger every day.

01:11.041 --> 01:11.875
Oh, my God.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.583
-We're in love!

01:11.959 --> 01:13.583
-(both giggling)

01:13.667 --> 01:15.208
Why would you phrase it like that?

01:15.291 --> 01:17.375
I am in no way ready to be a grandmother.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.250
Oh, I say, bring it on.

01:19.333 --> 01:21.625
I am ready for babies, babies,

01:19.333 --> 01:21.625
and more babies.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.875
Me, too, I would love

01:21.709 --> 01:23.875
a little grand-niece-daughter.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.041
-Oh, look at her there...

01:23.959 --> 01:25.041
-A little...

01:25.125 --> 01:26.500
-sweet something looking up at you.

01:25.125 --> 01:26.500
-...with the little freckles.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.542
-With the little feetsies!

01:26.583 --> 01:28.542
-Little freckles. Look at her.

01:28.625 --> 01:31.250
None of this is going to happen, okay?

01:31.333 --> 01:34.083
Because I made an appointment

01:31.333 --> 01:34.083
for you tomorrow

01:34.375 --> 01:35.834
so that you can get

01:34.375 --> 01:35.834
your marriage annulled.

01:35.917 --> 01:37.792
You can't tell us what to do anymore, Mom.

01:37.875 --> 01:38.792
We're adults.

01:38.875 --> 01:42.625
Now if you'll excuse us, we have to go

01:38.875 --> 01:42.625
meet our friends at the food court.

01:43.291 --> 01:44.458
Thanks for your support.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.083
Thanks for nothing.

01:47.417 --> 01:48.625
HEATHER (muttering): Nothing...

01:49.667 --> 01:51.041
-(door opens)

01:49.667 --> 01:51.041
-So how does this work?

01:51.125 --> 01:52.458
Separate bedrooms, or...

01:52.542 --> 01:55.166
-(door closes)

01:52.542 --> 01:55.166
-Same bedroom, twin beds, yeah.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.583
Just like when we were kids.

01:56.667 --> 01:57.583
(Heather groans)

01:59.875 --> 02:01.709
We failed as parents.

02:01.792 --> 02:03.792
(scoffs) I don't even call my sister.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.917
Tim, how are you not upset about this?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.208
I want to be, for you,

02:07.291 --> 02:10.083
but look, we raised

02:07.291 --> 02:10.083
a smart, responsible kid.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.625
And he found a beautiful girl

02:10.166 --> 02:12.625
and locked that down.

02:12.959 --> 02:15.709
Now, I did the same thing, not much older.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.917
I can't believe I'm alone here.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.583
And I can't believe you're not

02:18.000 --> 02:20.583
more curious about our in-laws.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.166
Now that you've kicked Tyler out,

02:22.250 --> 02:24.458
can we finally turn his room

02:22.250 --> 02:24.458
into a homeless shelter?

02:24.542 --> 02:26.125
We didn't kick Tyler out.

02:26.208 --> 02:29.000
Well, his action figures are gone,

02:26.208 --> 02:29.000
and there's a note on the door saying,

02:29.083 --> 02:31.375
"I'm not a child," written in crayon.

02:35.417 --> 02:37.041
So they didn't come back here?

02:37.125 --> 02:38.417
There's no room.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.750
They'd have to share a bunk bed

02:38.500 --> 02:40.750
with Clemmy's little sister,

02:40.834 --> 02:42.583
-and that would be super weird.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.583
-(laughs)

02:42.667 --> 02:44.333
Now why would<i> that </i>be weird?

02:44.709 --> 02:45.625
That was our childhood bed.

02:45.709 --> 02:48.375
Oh, God, how we used to love

02:45.709 --> 02:48.375
to make that thing shake.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.583
-Oh, boy.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.583
-We'd play Earthquake in it.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.041
"Oh, no, here comes the big one!"

02:52.125 --> 02:54.792
Okay, so you have my number

02:52.125 --> 02:54.792
in case you hear from them.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.917
Okay, come on, Tim, let's go.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.583
No, you go ahead, I'll parkour home.

02:57.667 --> 02:58.959
I have some follow-up questions.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.041
-No, come on, I need you to...

02:59.041 --> 03:01.041
-Hey, do you...

03:01.125 --> 03:04.625
Oh! I did this, I drove him away!

03:05.583 --> 03:07.542
I'm having a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

03:07.625 --> 03:08.875
Would you like some?

03:08.959 --> 03:10.000
No.

03:12.208 --> 03:14.083
I-I can get you a little dish.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.125
It's okay.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.834
He's gone forever, Mom.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.375
H-Here's a dish!

03:18.458 --> 03:20.500
I mean,

03:18.458 --> 03:20.500
what could I have done differently?

03:20.583 --> 03:23.041
Uh, you could have supported him.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.583
What?

03:25.667 --> 03:28.166
And let him make

03:25.667 --> 03:28.166
the biggest mistake of his life?

03:28.250 --> 03:29.500
No, that's called enabling,

03:29.583 --> 03:32.417
and that's why Greg wore pull-ups

03:29.583 --> 03:32.417
till he was 12.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.834
And now, you see him get

03:32.500 --> 03:35.834
on international flights with confidence.

03:35.917 --> 03:38.875
Mom-Mom, can Pop-Pop take

03:35.917 --> 03:38.875
his creepy puppets out of the garage?

03:39.375 --> 03:41.417
Oh,<i> you're </i>here.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.417
You've been harboring them

03:41.500 --> 03:44.417
this entire time?

03:44.500 --> 03:46.041
Excuse me, um,

03:46.125 --> 03:48.667
I'll be in the other room,

03:46.125 --> 03:48.667
uh, listening through the wall.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.959
Okay, so-so this is your life now?

03:53.041 --> 03:55.083
You're living

03:53.041 --> 03:55.083
in your grandparents' garage?

03:55.166 --> 03:57.500
It's better than living with somebody

03:55.166 --> 03:57.500
who's rooting against me.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.834
I am not rooting against you, I just...

04:02.333 --> 04:05.417
I don't want to see you do something

04:02.333 --> 04:05.417
that you're gonna regret.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.041
Mom, you still see me

04:05.500 --> 04:08.041
as an eight-year-old boy.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.417
But I am a man now, okay?

04:10.500 --> 04:12.083
And I can make my own decisions.

04:12.417 --> 04:15.709
And, yeah, I know

04:12.417 --> 04:15.709
that ten percent of marriages fail.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.625
But we're not gonna be one of them.

04:21.917 --> 04:22.750
Yeah.

04:23.208 --> 04:24.041
All right.

04:24.834 --> 04:26.417
Get your stuff and let's go home.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.667
Both of us?

04:27.750 --> 04:29.750
Yes, both of you.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.875
You guys are gonna have

04:29.834 --> 04:32.875
plenty of challenges.

04:32.959 --> 04:35.125
I am not gonna be one of them. Come here.

04:36.208 --> 04:37.500
Hey, and just so you know...

04:38.208 --> 04:40.709
it's 50 percent of marriages that fail.

04:42.542 --> 04:43.375
For real?

04:46.083 --> 04:47.000
(barking)

04:47.083 --> 04:48.834
All right, fiancée number two!

04:49.709 --> 04:50.834
-COLLEEN: Oh!

04:49.709 --> 04:50.834
-Let's do this!

04:51.208 --> 04:52.959
I can't believe I get to live

04:51.208 --> 04:52.959
with my best friend.

04:53.041 --> 04:55.542
I can't believe I'm officially out

04:53.041 --> 04:55.542
of my parents' garage.

04:56.166 --> 04:57.000
Hey!

04:58.041 --> 05:00.667
Whose moving truck is blocking my scooter?

05:01.834 --> 05:02.917
Oh...

05:03.000 --> 05:04.792
-I'm just kidding, ha-ha!

05:03.000 --> 05:04.792
-(laughter)

05:04.875 --> 05:07.667
Oh, I'm so pumped about our new roomie!

05:07.750 --> 05:08.625
Oh, yeah.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.792
Oh, it'll be great to have

05:08.709 --> 05:11.792
some masculine energy around here.

05:12.542 --> 05:13.417
Um...

05:13.917 --> 05:16.375
Hello? You wrestled?

05:16.458 --> 05:19.333
Uh, yup, yeah, I was, uh,

05:16.458 --> 05:19.333
undefeated in high school.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.125
Hello?

05:21.208 --> 05:22.667
So was I!

05:22.750 --> 05:24.291
They called me the Tackle Box,

05:24.375 --> 05:25.709
'cause I could take you down

05:24.375 --> 05:25.709
with my tackle,

05:25.792 --> 05:27.500
or I could take you down with my box...

05:27.583 --> 05:28.792
of wrestling moves.

05:28.875 --> 05:29.959
-Mm.

05:28.875 --> 05:29.959
-(slaps)

05:30.542 --> 05:31.458
-Whoo!

05:30.542 --> 05:31.458
-(slaps)

05:31.542 --> 05:33.333
(grunting)

05:33.709 --> 05:34.542
I forgot about Dougie.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.792
We've gone through worse obstacles.

05:36.875 --> 05:37.792
Yay.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.000
-Yay!

05:39.083 --> 05:39.917
It's a big condo.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.709
-We won't even notice she's here.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.709
-Yeah.

05:48.667 --> 05:49.834
You're in the splash zone.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.083
Want a spoon?

05:51.500 --> 05:52.959
I've got the king spoon.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.083
Yay.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.542
-(smooching)

05:55.583 --> 05:57.542
-(Dougie grunting)

05:57.625 --> 05:58.458
Um...

05:58.542 --> 06:00.291
-(Dougie continues grunting)

05:58.542 --> 06:00.291
-Do you hear that?

06:00.375 --> 06:02.834
Oh, yeah, that's the same thing I hear

06:00.375 --> 06:02.834
every night at this time.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.041
-What is she doing?

06:02.917 --> 06:05.041
-I don't know.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.458
I asked her, she said flossing.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.959
-No, no, no, Colleen.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.959
-What?

06:09.041 --> 06:10.709
This is not living together.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.000
This is dying together.

06:13.083 --> 06:13.917
(sighs)

06:15.166 --> 06:16.959
-You have to tell her to move out.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.959
-But I...

06:17.417 --> 06:18.250
Why me?

06:18.333 --> 06:19.458
Because it's your place.

06:19.542 --> 06:21.583
And I don't want to create

06:19.542 --> 06:21.583
some sexist dynamic

06:21.667 --> 06:22.834
where I fight your battles for you.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.500
And besides, I said "not it." Not it.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.000
Fine. I'll do it

06:24.583 --> 06:27.000
right after the music stops.

06:27.625 --> 06:28.458
What music?

06:28.542 --> 06:32.083
-(heavy metal music playing)

06:28.542 --> 06:32.083
-DOUGIE: Ooh, yeah! Yeah.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.208
-Huh.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.208
-DOUGIE: Ha-ha!

06:35.083 --> 06:36.000
Knock knock!

06:37.709 --> 06:39.166
Hi!

06:39.250 --> 06:42.375
Um, I wanted to have a little roomie chat.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.959
The thing is, since Matt's moved in

06:42.750 --> 06:44.959
and we're getting married

06:45.041 --> 06:46.458
that maybe you could move out

06:45.041 --> 06:46.458
and you could find an...

06:47.917 --> 06:48.750
(door opens)

06:49.625 --> 06:52.291
All right, she's not taking the hint.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.875
-It's because you're too nice.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.875
-Aw, thank you.

06:54.959 --> 06:58.041
-And you are too handsome.

06:54.959 --> 06:58.041
-Yeah, that's not what we're doing.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.166
-I know.

06:58.125 --> 06:59.166
-Okay.

06:59.583 --> 07:00.417
All right.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.417
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.333
You want me to move out?

07:06.000 --> 07:06.834
Wrestle me.

07:07.166 --> 07:08.917
If you win, I'll leave.

07:09.959 --> 07:11.208
You can't be serious.

07:11.291 --> 07:13.208
Oh, yeah, I am.

07:13.291 --> 07:14.500
Oh, don't do that.

07:15.542 --> 07:16.417
(clatters)

07:16.500 --> 07:17.625
Oops.

07:17.709 --> 07:20.667
Looks like Tackle Box

07:17.709 --> 07:20.667
just chummed the waters.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.333
Fine. I think my dad's still got

07:20.750 --> 07:23.333
a practice mat up in the attic.

07:23.417 --> 07:24.291
We'll use their garage.

07:24.375 --> 07:28.250
Good, because you're gonna become

07:24.375 --> 07:28.250
my practice mat, Matt!

07:28.750 --> 07:31.083
Also, I'm gonna need

07:28.750 --> 07:31.083
your parents' address.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.417
I'll text it to you.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.542
Do they like wine?

07:33.625 --> 07:35.542
'Cause it's rude to show up empty-handed.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.875
Don't spend too much money, though.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.875
It'll make them uncomfortable.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.583
-How about $30?

07:37.959 --> 07:40.583
-That's fine.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.917
-Good.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.917
-My mom's got a thing for Napa Valley.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.625
Who doesn't?

07:46.709 --> 07:49.417
(garage door opening)

07:49.500 --> 07:51.125
I can't believe you're doing this.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.041
MATT: Have to.

07:52.125 --> 07:55.041
Our whole relationship's been

07:52.125 --> 07:55.041
one obstacle after another, you know?

07:55.542 --> 07:58.000
I'm not afraid to fight for us.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.000
I'm gonna stand up like a man.

07:58.959 --> 08:02.917
-(laughing)

07:58.959 --> 08:02.917
-What are you guys doing here?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.458
You think I'm gonna miss you

08:03.000 --> 08:05.458
wrestling a girl?

08:05.542 --> 08:06.959

Whoo!

08:40.959 --> 08:41.959
(whistle blows)

08:42.083 --> 08:45.667
All right, first one

08:42.083 --> 08:45.667
to pin his opponent wins.

08:45.750 --> 08:46.583

09:02.125 --> 09:03.291
I'm doing this for us.

09:37.709 --> 09:39.583
Oh, she was like a big yellow blur.

I'm just gonna examine

09:47.417 --> 09:50.333
your erection, Mr. Short.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.625
In this case, call me John.

(EKG monitor beeping)

(John groaning)

09:59.417 --> 10:02.083

09:59.417 --> 10:02.083
and it won't go down.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.542
What if it stays like this forever?

10:04.625 --> 10:05.500
I don't know!

10:05.583 --> 10:06.667
I don't know, I...

10:06.750 --> 10:08.792
I wish you'd tell me

10:06.750 --> 10:08.792
the next time you take a pill.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.125
I thought it would be a nice surprise.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.417
Oh, I'm definitely surprised.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.250
I may need you to punch it.

10:14.709 --> 10:15.792
I'm not gonna punch it.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.166
-Oh...

10:15.875 --> 10:17.166
-(cell phone rings)

10:17.250 --> 10:18.542
-(cell phone beeps)

10:17.250 --> 10:18.542
-Hello?

10:18.625 --> 10:19.458
Mom, hey, where are you?

10:19.542 --> 10:21.375
I thought you want to go shopping

10:19.542 --> 10:21.375
for Jen's baby shower.

10:21.458 --> 10:24.333
Oh, honey, I-I had to take

10:21.458 --> 10:24.333
your dad to St. Fran's.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.667
Don't tell her.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.083
It's so humiliating.

10:27.166 --> 10:28.625
Dad's in the hospital? What is it?

10:28.709 --> 10:30.000
<i>It's not serious, is it?</i>

10:30.083 --> 10:32.166
Um, I-I-I can't discuss it, dear.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.625
I'm calling everyone.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.625
I'm coming down there right now.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.417
No! Heather?

10:37.834 --> 10:39.709
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

10:41.709 --> 10:43.166
Is Pop-Pop gonna die?

10:43.250 --> 10:45.667
You know, we're all gonna die someday,

10:43.250 --> 10:45.667
Sophia, so maybe take comfort in that.

10:45.750 --> 10:46.709
Matt, hey, listen.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.417
Dad is at St. Fran's.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.417
I'm on my way there right now.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.792
I'm just gonna examine

10:49.917 --> 10:52.792
your erection, Mr. Short.

10:53.291 --> 10:57.083
In this case, call me John. (grunting)

10:57.166 --> 10:58.750
Let's just give the epinephrine

10:57.166 --> 10:58.750
a chance to work.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.125
If it doesn't,

10:59.291 --> 11:01.125
we're gonna have to drain the blood.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.250
-Pop-Pop!

11:03.041 --> 11:04.250
-Oh!

11:04.333 --> 11:05.709
-JOHN: Oh, no!

11:04.333 --> 11:05.709
-Kids, no!

11:05.792 --> 11:06.625
-(Samantha gasps)

11:05.792 --> 11:06.625
-JOAN: No, kids.

11:06.709 --> 11:07.750
What? What's the big deal?

11:07.834 --> 11:08.667
Oh, oh, oh!

11:08.750 --> 11:10.792
-Ooh, not a good time to hop on Pop-Pop.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.792
-JOHN: Uh...

11:10.875 --> 11:12.458
-Hop off Pop! Hop off Pop!

11:10.875 --> 11:12.458
-JOAN: Mm-hm.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.792
You make me stay off the Internet,

11:12.542 --> 11:14.792
but you let me see that?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.792
-I know, I...

11:14.875 --> 11:16.792
-JOAN: Uh, come on, kids.

11:16.875 --> 11:20.458
Let's go play What's That Smell:

11:16.875 --> 11:20.458
Hospital Edition.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.291
Mom, they can't unsee that.

11:22.375 --> 11:23.333
(groans)

11:23.417 --> 11:24.542
I'm so sorry.

11:24.625 --> 11:25.834
-Dad?

11:24.625 --> 11:25.834
-Oh, no! No.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.250
-How you do...

11:25.917 --> 11:27.250
-(John groaning)

11:29.250 --> 11:30.250
Feel better.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.125
We came as soon as we heard.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.417
Are you okay, Pop-Pop?

11:38.917 --> 11:40.125
(groaning)

11:40.208 --> 11:41.291
-You should go.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.291
-You're not helping.

11:42.709 --> 11:45.333
Just pull the plug.

11:42.709 --> 11:45.333
I don't want to live anymore.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.542
Now I can't see.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.291
So, did you, uh...

11:53.583 --> 11:54.417
see it?

11:55.458 --> 11:56.291
Yeah.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.458
Yeah, I saw it.

11:59.083 --> 12:00.041
You get one of those?

12:00.333 --> 12:01.417
No, Greg, I did not.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.250
-Did you?

12:03.917 --> 12:05.250
-No, man.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.041
I did not.

12:07.458 --> 12:08.583
I got his cholesterol.

12:08.917 --> 12:10.083
He passed that along.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.166
-Oh, I'm so glad Dad's gonna be okay.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.166
-Pfft.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.417
Yeah, from what we saw,

12:16.250 --> 12:18.417
he's doing better than okay.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.500
Really? You thought that was big?

12:20.583 --> 12:21.417
Hey, guys.

12:37.458 --> 12:40.375
I'm so sorry I took this stupid pill.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.959
You didn't need it.

12:42.041 --> 12:45.125
Yeah, but you know how we like

12:42.041 --> 12:45.125
to watch<i> 60 Minutes </i>each Sunday,

12:45.208 --> 12:47.542
but sometimes, we wish it were<i> 80 Minutes?</i>

12:47.625 --> 12:50.709
Yeah, I know,

12:47.625 --> 12:50.709
but you really didn't need it,

12:50.792 --> 12:56.291
because I was already giving you a pill

12:50.792 --> 12:56.291
crushed up in your smoothie every morning.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.542
And that's why this happened.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.917
Why would you do that?

13:00.000 --> 13:04.208
Last year, when you had a problem,

13:00.000 --> 13:04.208
you went out and bought a boat.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.208
My life is a lie.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.166
Just end it.

13:09.542 --> 13:10.750
Just end it!

13:12.959 --> 13:14.959
Hm. Now I'm hot.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.083
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.542
I-I-I'm supposed to be

13:17.166 --> 13:19.542
the head of the family.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.500
Our kids are supposed to look up to me.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.959
But how can they do that when I-I have...

13:25.041 --> 13:27.083
Have nothing but a soggy breadstick?

13:27.166 --> 13:30.000
But honey, they love you.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.000
That's why they're all here.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.917
And they'll look up to you no matter what.

13:33.917 --> 13:34.959
What about you?

13:35.041 --> 13:36.709
Well, I don't care

13:35.041 --> 13:36.709
if we have to prop it up

13:36.792 --> 13:39.166
with two Popsicle sticks

13:36.792 --> 13:39.166
and some duct tape.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.625
So, you want me to stop doing it?

13:43.709 --> 13:45.834
Yes, I want you to stop doing it.

13:47.375 --> 13:51.250
Okay, I'm going to stop doing it.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.166
Now I'm confused.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.834
A toast to Jen!

13:59.166 --> 14:01.917
So did the hospital say

13:59.166 --> 14:01.917
that you could mix alcohol

14:02.000 --> 14:03.625
with the drugs they gave you?

14:04.208 --> 14:05.625
They didn't say I couldn't.

14:11.625 --> 14:12.458
Greg?

14:12.792 --> 14:14.750
Lark is filthy. What happened?

14:14.834 --> 14:17.500
Did you, like, go mud wrestling

14:14.834 --> 14:17.500
down a ravine?

14:17.583 --> 14:20.333
I accidentally spilled coffee on her

14:17.583 --> 14:20.333
when I put her in the car seat.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.583
I spilled some on me, too,

14:21.667 --> 14:23.959
but I figured since I have less

14:21.667 --> 14:23.959
of a meltdown when I change outfits,

14:24.041 --> 14:25.542
I took the easier way out, so...

14:28.709 --> 14:29.542
It's good coffee.

14:29.625 --> 14:30.583
Yeah.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.625
As helpful as you've been this morning,

14:32.709 --> 14:34.583
I feel like maybe I'll change her

14:34.667 --> 14:36.417
and you can just go in to the brunch.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.542
-You're gonna drive away, aren't you?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.542
-No.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.208
Take my keys just in case.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.458
(car door closes)

14:42.542 --> 14:44.458
(indistinct chattering)

14:44.542 --> 14:46.291
-Hey!

14:44.542 --> 14:46.291
-(door closes)

14:46.375 --> 14:49.000
ALL: Hey!

14:49.083 --> 14:49.917
What's this?

14:50.000 --> 14:53.959
We're all still buzzing

14:50.000 --> 14:53.959
from the news of Jen's pregnancy,

14:54.041 --> 14:57.917
so we thought it'd be wonderful

14:54.041 --> 14:57.917
to shower you with gifts.

14:58.000 --> 14:58.875
Uh, Mom...

14:58.959 --> 15:01.000
No, no, it's just a few. Just a few.

15:01.083 --> 15:04.583
I know it's a little early,

15:01.083 --> 15:04.583
but like my washer-dryer says,

15:04.667 --> 15:06.041
front-load the fun.

15:06.125 --> 15:06.959
Mom...

15:07.834 --> 15:08.667
What?

15:13.041 --> 15:16.041
-(paper rustling)

15:13.041 --> 15:16.041
-(people clamoring)

15:17.667 --> 15:18.709
Three weeks ago?

15:19.083 --> 15:20.583
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

15:20.959 --> 15:22.583
And I feel so stupid.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.333
Oh, Mom, no, no. It's-It's my fault.

15:24.417 --> 15:27.041
I'm the one who blurted out

15:24.417 --> 15:27.041
she was pregnant. It was way too early.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.125
Look, she's getting through it.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.250
She just doesn't really want

15:28.208 --> 15:30.250
to talk about it.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.083
-Yeah, like Heather with her hairy mole.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.083
-Tim! Hey!

15:33.709 --> 15:35.500
Sorry, I'm just trying

15:33.709 --> 15:35.500
to break the tension!

15:35.583 --> 15:37.750
Okay, look, I know

15:35.583 --> 15:37.750
this is not the family strong suit,

15:37.834 --> 15:39.834
but can we just try to act normal,

15:39.917 --> 15:43.458
all right, and just-just have, uh,

15:39.917 --> 15:43.458
a-a completely normal brunch

15:43.542 --> 15:45.750
and I'll just go and stall her?

15:47.625 --> 15:49.208
-How's it going?

15:47.625 --> 15:49.208
-(Lark crying)

15:49.291 --> 15:51.291
-It's good.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.291
-Aw...

15:51.375 --> 15:53.041
Oh! Ooh. Oops.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.417
Oh, sorry.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.000
-Oh...

15:54.500 --> 15:57.000
-Dude, honestly.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.583
Okay, well, uh, let's just throw on

15:57.083 --> 15:59.583
a new outfit,

15:59.667 --> 16:02.792
and let's just do it slow, uh,

15:59.667 --> 16:02.792
so I can watch how you do it.

16:04.875 --> 16:05.917
Hi.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.125
-Hi!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.125
-(door closes)

16:07.208 --> 16:10.041
Sorry, we had

16:07.208 --> 16:10.041
a little wardrobe malfunction.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.917
Lark's onesie is now officially donesie.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.709
Oh! (laughs)

16:14.792 --> 16:16.250
How you rhyme!

16:16.333 --> 16:18.875
I could listen to it all the time.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.834
Oh, listen to me, I'm doing it, too!

16:22.458 --> 16:24.625
Your talent's contagious, Jen.

16:24.709 --> 16:25.542
May I?

16:25.875 --> 16:27.166
Oh. Yeah, sure.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.166
(Lark cooing)

16:29.250 --> 16:30.417
Hi.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.959
BOTH: Oh, hi!

16:37.208 --> 16:38.875
-We were discussing the gold standard.

16:37.208 --> 16:38.875
-Mm.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.792
-Ah.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.792
-I wish gold was standard for me.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.208
-(both laughing)

16:41.875 --> 16:44.208
-So dumb.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.583
-COLLEEN: Yeah.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.583
-(mouthing)

16:45.667 --> 16:48.083
(clears throat)

16:45.667 --> 16:48.083
I was recently beat up by a girl.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.000
Yep, that checks out for me.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.250
-Yeah.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.250
-I'm gonna go...

16:51.333 --> 16:52.583
-JEN: Yeah, I think that's a good move.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.583
-Yeah. Yeah, babe.

16:52.667 --> 16:53.667
-MATT: Oop.

16:52.667 --> 16:53.667
-This way.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.583
JEN: Hey, guys, how's it going?

16:59.625 --> 17:00.583
Hey!

17:01.417 --> 17:02.959
Hey!

17:05.750 --> 17:07.917
Oh! Oh, so good!

17:08.166 --> 17:10.583
Oh, this frosting! Oh, that is so good.

17:10.667 --> 17:11.875
So good! Do you want some?

17:11.959 --> 17:14.500
Uh, no, I generally prefer a-a plate...

17:14.583 --> 17:15.959
-to a human hand.

17:14.583 --> 17:15.959
-HEATHER: Mm.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.000
Oh, huh. Fancy.

17:17.083 --> 17:18.667
-Really?

17:17.083 --> 17:18.667
-Yeah.

17:18.750 --> 17:19.959
Uh, you know what, I'll have some.

17:20.041 --> 17:20.875
-It's so good.

17:20.041 --> 17:20.875
-GREG: Yeah?

17:20.959 --> 17:22.917
-HEATHER: Yeah, get in there.

17:20.959 --> 17:22.917
-Oh, my God, Greg, please.

17:23.583 --> 17:24.583
HEATHER: Just get in there.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.625
Um, honey, I'll just be in the...

17:26.709 --> 17:28.834
-GREG (muffled): Mm-hm, okay. Love you.

17:26.709 --> 17:28.834
-Okay, okay.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.083
What are you doing?

17:33.458 --> 17:34.625
Just act normal!

17:34.709 --> 17:36.709
You know, just people at brunch.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.458
I mean, we do it every weekend.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.834
Oh, a toast to Jen.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.375
-Uh, Dad...

17:47.500 --> 17:49.375
-To me? Me?

17:49.458 --> 17:51.417
Uh, er, um...

17:51.959 --> 17:53.083
What can I say? Uh...

17:53.458 --> 17:55.166
you're a national treasure.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.500
Wow, that's so nice.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.375
So did the hospital say

17:57.583 --> 18:00.375
that you could mix alcohol

18:00.458 --> 18:02.083
with the drugs they gave you?

18:02.667 --> 18:04.041
They didn't say I couldn't.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.291
-Right.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.291
-Hey, Jen, where's the diaper bag?

18:07.375 --> 18:09.125
Her tushy got a little mushy.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.291
Oh, listen to me, I'm rhyming again!

18:11.375 --> 18:12.709
(laughs) I'm on a roll.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.166
Clearly. Uh, the only problem

18:12.792 --> 18:16.166
is that we-we are out of outfits.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.208
-You know what?

18:16.250 --> 18:17.208
-So...

18:17.625 --> 18:20.792
Why don't we just take her home

18:17.625 --> 18:20.792
and change her there? Huh?

18:20.875 --> 18:22.166
SOPHIE: I got Lark an outfit.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.166
You did?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.959
-(chuckles) Thanks.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.959
-SOPHIE: Mm-hm.

18:34.583 --> 18:35.667
Oh, that's not for Lark.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.625
I'm sorry.

18:39.333 --> 18:41.792
Will you just, um, excuse me?

18:44.458 --> 18:46.291
(indistinct whispering)

18:46.375 --> 18:48.667
No, honey, I'll go.

18:56.834 --> 18:57.959
Hi. (sniffles)

18:58.750 --> 18:59.583
Sorry.

19:00.458 --> 19:03.667
I wanted to wait to talk about it

19:00.458 --> 19:03.667
until I knew I wouldn't... (sniffles)

19:03.750 --> 19:04.834
uh, do this.

19:04.917 --> 19:09.458
You do whatever it is that you need to do,

19:04.917 --> 19:09.458
and to hell with everybody else.

19:10.542 --> 19:13.792
Um, sometimes it-it helps

19:10.542 --> 19:13.792
to talk about it.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.458
When I had my miscarriage,

19:16.417 --> 19:19.709
people acted as though it were

19:16.417 --> 19:19.709
some kind of a shameful secret,

19:19.792 --> 19:21.500
and I felt really alone.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.542
I-I didn't know that you had had one.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.875
Yeah, after Matt.

19:25.959 --> 19:26.959
Oh.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.667
Yeah, I still think about it.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.417
But you know what else I think about?

19:32.792 --> 19:36.667
If I hadn't lost that baby,

19:32.792 --> 19:36.667
I wouldn't have had Greg.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.792
And you wouldn't have Lark.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.250
And we wouldn't have you.

19:46.417 --> 19:47.250
Thank you.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.333
("Shelter from the Storm" playing)

19:54.625 --> 19:55.458
Now...

19:56.583 --> 19:58.083
You know, there's a back door.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.208
(laughs)

19:59.291 --> 20:00.500
And you can sneak out,

20:00.583 --> 20:02.667
and you can face the gang

20:00.583 --> 20:02.667
when you feel ready.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.291
I actually think I'm ready now.
