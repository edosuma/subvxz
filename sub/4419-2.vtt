SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.495
MAN, THIS FEELS LIKE
THE LONGEST MINUTE
OF MY LIFE.

00:57.497 --> 00:59.397
OH, HI KENNY.

00:59.399 --> 01:00.965
GENTLEMEN,
THE FATHER IS...

01:00.967 --> 01:04.135
( Mr. Garrison )
HEY, WHAT THE
HELL'S GOING ON?

01:04.137 --> 01:06.070
( Jimbo )
IT'S A POWER
OUTAGE.

01:06.072 --> 01:07.872
( gunshots )

01:07.874 --> 01:10.174
IS EVERYBODY
OKAY?

01:10.176 --> 01:12.143
THAT SOUNDED
LIKE A GUNSHOT.

01:12.145 --> 01:14.178
OH MY GOD, LOOK!

01:15.214 --> 01:17.348
( mumbling )

01:17.350 --> 01:18.582
YOU BASTARDS!

01:18.584 --> 01:20.351
MOFESTO'S BEEN SHOT!

01:20.353 --> 01:21.819
IS HE... DEAD?

01:21.821 --> 01:23.254
HEY, THIS WINDOW
IS SHOT OUT, TOO.

01:23.256 --> 01:26.457
THAT MEANS THE KILLER WAS
NOT SOMEBODY IN THIS ROOM.

01:26.459 --> 01:27.491
THEN WHO WAS IT?

01:27.493 --> 01:29.293
( narrator )
WHO SHOT MOFESTO?

01:29.295 --> 01:30.928
WAS IT THE
SCHOOL COUNSELOR?

01:30.930 --> 01:33.264
OR WAS IT
MISS CRABTREE...?

01:33.266 --> 01:34.131
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

01:34.133 --> 01:35.766
I DIDN'T FIND OUT
WHO MY FATHER WAS!

01:35.768 --> 01:37.068
OR WAS IT
MISS BROSLOVSKI?

01:37.070 --> 01:39.503
WAIT, HE'S STILL BREATHING,
HE'S NOT DEAD.

01:39.505 --> 01:41.272
GODAMMIT,
WHO'S MY FATHER?

01:41.274 --> 01:42.640
WE HAVE TO GET HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:42.642 --> 01:44.208
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME!

01:44.210 --> 01:46.410
COME ON CHILDREN.

01:47.180 --> 01:48.079
THAT POOR KID.

01:48.081 --> 01:50.648
IT MUST BE HELL FOR HIM
GOING THROUGH ALL THIS.

01:51.918 --> 01:54.151
THERE'S A MURDERER
FREE IN SOUTH PARK!

01:54.153 --> 01:55.820
WE HAVE TO FIND
OUT WHO IT IS

01:55.822 --> 01:56.854
BEFORE THEY
KILL AGAIN!

01:56.856 --> 01:59.023
YEAH, GOD ONLY KNOWS WHO
THEY'LL KILL NEXT.

01:59.025 --> 02:01.158
( narrator )
WHO WILL THEY KILL NEXT?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.461
WILL IT BE JIMBO,
BARBRADY,

02:03.463 --> 02:05.463
THE DENVER BRONCOS?

02:06.532 --> 02:07.498
IS HE AWAKE YET?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.666
HE'S BLEEDING PRETTY
BAD BACK HERE.

02:08.668 --> 02:11.002
DON'T LET HIM BLEED
ON MY<i> MEREDITH BAXTER-BIRNEY</i>

02:11.004 --> 02:11.869
MEMORIAL TOWEL!

02:11.871 --> 02:13.504
WHAT'S A
MEREDITH BAXTER-BIRNEY
MEMORIAL TOWEL?

02:13.506 --> 02:15.740
I WAS ACTUALLY WITH
MEREDITH BAXTER-BIRNEY

02:15.742 --> 02:16.607
IN THIS VERY CAR.

02:16.609 --> 02:18.442
AND AFTERWARDS
WE USED THAT TOWEL TO...

02:18.444 --> 02:20.644
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHY AM I TELLING
YOU THIS?

02:20.646 --> 02:22.179
COULD YOU PULL OVER
SO I CAN GET OUT?

02:22.181 --> 02:24.115
WHAT, WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE HOSPITAL.

02:24.117 --> 02:25.082
I HAVE TO
GET OUT FIRST.

02:25.084 --> 02:27.118
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT,
I CAN'T STAND HOSPITALS.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.952
SORRY STAN,

02:27.954 --> 02:29.186
WE JUST GOT
TO DROP MOFESTO

02:29.188 --> 02:30.755
AND THEN WE CAN GET
OUT OF THERE, ALRIGHT?

02:30.757 --> 02:32.456
MAN, IT'S REALLY
STARTING TO SNOW.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.025
I HOPE THEY DON'T
CLOSE THE ROADS.

02:34.027 --> 02:35.726
THEY CAN'T,
MOFESTO CAN'T DIE.

02:35.728 --> 02:38.496
MAYBE IT'S BETTER YOU DON'T
KNOW WHO YOUR FATHER IS.

02:38.498 --> 02:39.230
NO WAY DUDE,

02:39.232 --> 02:40.431
I CAN'T STAND TO
LEAVE THINGS UNFINISHED.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.067
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU HEAR
THE FIRST PART OF THAT SONG,

02:43.069 --> 02:44.802
"COME SAIL AWAY"
BY STYX.

02:44.804 --> 02:46.604
I HEAR THE FIRST
PART OF THAT SONG,

02:46.606 --> 02:48.005
I HAVE TO FINISH IT.

02:48.007 --> 02:48.672
REALLY?

02:48.674 --> 02:51.308
YEAH, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
UNTIL IT'S DONE.

02:52.578 --> 02:56.313
♪ I'M SAILING AWAY ♪

02:56.315 --> 02:57.148
NO, DON'T!

02:57.150 --> 03:00.651

03:05.191 --> 03:09.160
( singing fast )

03:27.013 --> 03:30.114
( still singing )

03:33.686 --> 03:34.618
WHOA DUDE!

03:34.620 --> 03:36.220
WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO, MAYOR?

03:36.222 --> 03:37.655
THIS KILLER IS
ON THE LOOSE.

03:37.657 --> 03:39.256
WE CAN'T EVEN
LEAVE OUR HOMES

03:39.258 --> 03:41.492
FOR FEAR OF OUR
CHILDREN'S SAFETY!

03:41.494 --> 03:44.728
UHH, WHERE ARE
OUR CHILDREN?

03:45.531 --> 03:46.430
OFFICER BARBRADY,

03:46.432 --> 03:47.631
LET'S PRETEND
FOR ONE SECOND

03:47.633 --> 03:50.701
THAT WE HAD A COMPETENT
LAW ENFORCER IN THIS TOWN,

03:50.703 --> 03:52.203
WHAT WOULD HE DO?

03:52.205 --> 03:55.039
HMM, THAT'S A GOOD
QUESTION, MAYOR.

03:55.041 --> 03:58.509
LET ME GET RIGHT ON
THAT WITH THINKING.

03:59.612 --> 04:00.678
MAYOR, MAYOR!

04:00.680 --> 04:02.513
THE PRESS IS HERE.

04:02.515 --> 04:03.714
MY NAME IS
SID GREENFIELD,

04:03.716 --> 04:05.416
I'M THE DIRECTOR
FROM LOS ANGELES

04:05.418 --> 04:06.650
FOR "AMERICA'S
MOST WANTED".

04:06.652 --> 04:09.386
YOU CERTAINLY MADE IT
UP HERE QUICKLY.

04:09.388 --> 04:11.122
WE'RE DESPERATE
FOR STORIES.

04:11.124 --> 04:13.624
AND THIS ONE
IS SO COMPELLING.

04:13.626 --> 04:14.558
REALLY?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.127
SURE, THIS STORY
HAS EVERYTHING--

04:16.129 --> 04:20.364
PEOPLE, FURNITURE, TALKING,
IT'S A REAL AMERICAN STORY.

04:20.366 --> 04:21.732
I THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING.

04:21.734 --> 04:24.869
NO, THAT'S
SUBTRACTION.

04:24.871 --> 04:26.070
MR. DIRECTOR PERSON,

04:26.072 --> 04:27.972
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT TO DO?

04:27.974 --> 04:29.907
MAYOR, SHOULDN'T
WE BE FOCUSING...

04:29.909 --> 04:30.541
SHH.

04:30.543 --> 04:31.675
WE JUST WANT TO
DO A RE-CREATION

04:31.677 --> 04:32.843
OF THE STORY
FOR OUR SHOW.

04:32.845 --> 04:34.078
THEN WE'LL FLASH
A NUMBER ON THE SCREEN

04:34.080 --> 04:36.013
THAT PEOPLE CAN CALL
IF THEY HAVE ANY INFORMATION

04:36.015 --> 04:38.582
REGARDING THE IDENTITY
OR LOCATION OF THE SHOOTER.

04:38.584 --> 04:39.316
THAT'S IT.

04:39.318 --> 04:40.718
YOU WIN, WE WIN,
AMERICA WINS.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.254
ARE YOU SURE THIS WOULDN'T
MAKE OUR LITTLE TOWN

04:43.256 --> 04:44.455
LOOK DANGEROUS?

04:44.457 --> 04:45.356
DON'T WORRY, MAYOR.

04:45.358 --> 04:47.825
"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED"
IS NOT ABOUT VIOLENCE,

04:47.827 --> 04:49.727
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY.

04:49.729 --> 04:50.461
IT IS?

04:50.463 --> 04:52.897
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

04:52.899 --> 04:55.466
GREAT, WE'LL GET STARTED
WITH AUDITIONS IMMEDIATELY.

04:55.468 --> 04:56.934
WHAT PART SHOULD
WE CAST FIRST?

04:56.936 --> 04:59.436
( narrator )
WHO WILL THE DIRECTOR
CAST FIRST?

04:59.438 --> 05:03.440
WILL IT BE MR. GARRISON,
OFFICER BARBRADY, CHEF?

05:03.442 --> 05:06.744
( Miss Cartman )
I WANT TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

05:06.746 --> 05:07.811
WELL, WE CAN DO THAT.

05:07.813 --> 05:10.181
THIS MUST BE
A VERY DIFFICULT
TIME FOR YOU, MRS...

05:10.183 --> 05:13.851
CARTMAN, YES, IT'S
SUCH A HARD DECISION BUT,

05:13.853 --> 05:16.720
I JUST DON'T FEEL
LIKE I CAN RAISE A CHILD

05:16.722 --> 05:18.322
IN THIS SCREWY WORLD.

05:18.324 --> 05:19.256
YES MISS CARTMAN,

05:19.258 --> 05:20.824
IF YOU DON'T FEEL FIT
TO RAISE A CHILD,

05:20.826 --> 05:22.393
AN ABORTION IS
PROBABLY THE ANSWER.

05:22.395 --> 05:24.795
DO YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL
TIME OF CONCEPTION?

05:24.797 --> 05:26.797
ABOUT EIGHT-YEARS-AGO.

05:26.799 --> 05:30.601
I SEE, SO
THE FETUS IS...?

05:30.603 --> 05:32.336
EIGHT-YEARS-OLD.

05:32.338 --> 05:33.170
MISS CARTMAN,

05:33.172 --> 05:35.039
EIGHT-YEARS-OLD
IS A LITTLE LATE

05:35.041 --> 05:36.840
TO BE CONSIDERING
ABORTION.

05:36.842 --> 05:37.508
REALLY?

05:37.510 --> 05:39.076
YES, THIS IS WHAT
WE WOULD REFER TO

05:39.078 --> 05:40.711
AS THE 40th TRIMESTER!

05:40.713 --> 05:42.646
I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M A FIT MOTHER.

05:42.648 --> 05:45.816
WE PREFER TO ABORT BABIES
A LITTLE EARLIER ON.

05:45.818 --> 05:47.751
IN FACT, THERE'S
A LAW AGAINST ABORTIONS

05:47.753 --> 05:48.986
AFTER THE
SECOND TRIMESTER.

05:48.988 --> 05:51.956
WELL, I THINK YOU
NEED TO KEEP YOUR LAWS

05:51.958 --> 05:52.890
OFF OF MY BODY!

05:52.892 --> 05:56.093
HMM, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
HELP YOU, MISS CARTMAN.

05:56.095 --> 05:57.261
IF YOU WANT TO
CHANGE THE LAW

05:57.263 --> 05:58.862
YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK
WITH YOUR CONGRESSMAN.

05:58.864 --> 06:01.565
WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I INTEND TO DO.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.734
GOOD DAY!

06:03.869 --> 06:06.503
COME ON CHILDREN,
WE GOTTA FIND A DOCTOR.

06:06.505 --> 06:08.072
I CAN'T
DO IT DUDE.

06:08.074 --> 06:09.006
COME ON STAN,

06:09.008 --> 06:10.174
HOSPITALS AREN'T
ALL THAT BAD.

06:10.176 --> 06:11.875
YEAH, STOP
BEING A WUSS.

06:11.877 --> 06:13.077
DOCTOR!

06:13.079 --> 06:14.078
ONE MINUTE,
PLEASE.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.781
NURSE, I NEED 20 CCs
OF SODIUM PENTATHOL, STAT!

06:17.917 --> 06:19.250
WHOA DUDE, SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY ARMS.

06:19.252 --> 06:21.085
WE'RE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
EMPLOYER HERE, SON.

06:21.087 --> 06:24.488
DOCTOR, WE'VE GOT
A SHOT CRACKER OUTSIDE.

06:24.490 --> 06:25.522
I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU

06:25.524 --> 06:27.458
AFTER I INJECT THIS MAN
WITH A LONG NEEDLE.

06:27.460 --> 06:28.726
OH MAN, I'M
GONNA BE SICK.

06:28.728 --> 06:29.827
THERE, THERE,
YOUNG MAN,

06:29.829 --> 06:31.428
MEDICAL SCIENCE IS
NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

06:31.430 --> 06:34.331
I THINK YOU'RE
HITTING THE BONE.

06:34.333 --> 06:37.568
YES, I CAN HEAR
THE NEEDLE SCRAPING

06:37.570 --> 06:39.136
AGAINST THE BONE INSIDE.

06:39.138 --> 06:41.105
OOPS, HE'S
HEMORRHAGING.

06:41.107 --> 06:43.774
OOPS, HIS HEAD
FELL OFF.

06:43.776 --> 06:45.409
I'M GETTING
OUT OF HERE.

06:45.411 --> 06:46.043
STAN!

06:46.045 --> 06:48.912
SOME PEOPLE JUST
HAVE A WEAK STOMACH.

06:49.715 --> 06:51.749
AND THE FATHER OF
ERIC CARTMAN IS...

06:51.751 --> 06:52.950
BANG, OH!

06:52.952 --> 06:53.851
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

06:53.853 --> 06:55.886
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

06:55.888 --> 06:58.322
I THINK I'VE SEEN
ENOUGH GENETIC ENGINEERS.

06:58.324 --> 06:59.823
LET'S MOVE ON
TO THE AUDITIONS

06:59.825 --> 07:01.859
FOR THE PART
OF MR. GARRISON.

07:01.861 --> 07:03.594
CALL THE
MR. GARRISON
AUDITIONS.

07:03.596 --> 07:07.564
I SURE HOPE I'M NOT
ERIC CARTMAN'S FATHER, MR. HAT.

07:07.566 --> 07:10.134
YOU CAN SAY THAT
AGAIN, MR. GARRISON.

07:10.136 --> 07:11.101
ALRIGHT, NOT BAD.

07:11.103 --> 07:13.304
LET'S KEEP THEM
ON THE TOP PILE, NEXT!

07:13.306 --> 07:16.607
I SURE HOPE I'M NOT
ERIC CARTMAN'S FATHER, MR. HAT.

07:16.609 --> 07:19.276
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN,
MR. GARRISON.

07:19.278 --> 07:21.145
THANK YOU, NEXT!

07:21.147 --> 07:22.413
WHAT?

07:22.415 --> 07:23.080
NEXT!

07:23.082 --> 07:26.550
I SURE HOPE I'M NOT ERIC
CARTMAN'S FATHER, MR. HAT.

07:26.552 --> 07:28.686
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN,
MR. GARRISON.

07:28.688 --> 07:30.054
PERFECT, YOU GOT IT.

07:30.056 --> 07:31.388
LET'S MOVE ON
TO THE CHEFS.

07:31.390 --> 07:33.791
AND SO YOU SEE
CONGRESSMAN O'REILLY,

07:33.793 --> 07:35.426
THAT'S WHY
I THINK

07:35.428 --> 07:37.561
ABORTION LAWS
SHOULD BE CHANGED.

07:37.563 --> 07:38.595
WELL, ALL
I KNOW IS THAT

07:38.597 --> 07:40.297
THIRD TRIMESTER
ABORTIONS ARE ILLEGAL.

07:40.299 --> 07:42.166
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT 40th.

07:42.168 --> 07:44.134
BUT THE PERSON AT
"UNPLANNED PARENTHOOD"

07:44.136 --> 07:46.437
SAID YOU WERE WHO
I HAD TO TALK TO

07:46.439 --> 07:47.671
ABOUT CHANGING
THE LAW.

07:47.673 --> 07:50.174
NO, I THINK YOU'VE
GOT TO TALK TO THE GOVERNOR

07:50.176 --> 07:51.675
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

07:51.677 --> 07:52.643
OH, DEAR.

07:52.645 --> 07:54.912
WELL, THIS IS ABOUT
ALL I CAN DO FOR HIM.

07:54.914 --> 07:56.080
CAN'T YOU GET
HIM TO TALK?

07:56.082 --> 07:57.314
I HAVE TO KNOW
WHO MY FATHER IS!

07:57.316 --> 07:58.882
SORRY SON,
IT MIGHT BE A WHILE.

07:58.884 --> 08:00.851
WAKE UP,
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH!

08:00.853 --> 08:01.518
WHOA!

08:01.520 --> 08:02.686
NOW SON, THAT'S NOT
GONNA DO HIM ANY GOOD.

08:02.688 --> 08:05.022
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF THERE'S
A CHANGE IN HIS CONDITION.

08:05.024 --> 08:06.123
I CAN'T WAIT
ANYMORE.

08:06.125 --> 08:07.791
WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:07.793 --> 08:08.992
HEY CARTMAN!

08:08.994 --> 08:09.727
WHAT?

08:09.729 --> 08:11.962
♪ I'M SAILING... ♪

08:11.964 --> 08:13.997
♪ AWAY ♪

08:13.999 --> 08:16.967
( singing fast )

08:17.970 --> 08:19.570
OKAY, LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE, NOW.

08:19.572 --> 08:21.038
I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S GONNA BE TOO EASY.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.374
( doctor )
MY GOD, THAT'S
A HELLUVA STORM.

08:23.376 --> 08:24.708
WEAK.

08:24.710 --> 08:28.011
( still singing )

08:28.681 --> 08:29.813
GOD, I HATE
MOUNTAINS.

08:29.815 --> 08:31.815
THIS BETTER NOT PUSH BACK
OUR SHOOTING SCHEDULE.

08:31.817 --> 08:34.685
OKAY PEOPLE, LET'S
REHEARSE THE REENACTMENT

08:34.687 --> 08:36.487
FROM THE TOP
BEFORE WE SHOOT IT.

08:36.489 --> 08:37.254
WHO'S THAT?

08:37.256 --> 08:38.689
THAT'S TVs<i> ERIC ROBERTS.</i>

08:38.691 --> 08:40.457
WE WERE ABLE TO GET
HIM TO PLAY THE PART

08:40.459 --> 08:41.825
OF THE LITTLE
MONKEY GUY.

08:41.827 --> 08:44.094
TALK ABOUT
WASHED UP, HUH?

08:44.096 --> 08:45.629
GREAT TO HAVE
YOU, ERIC.

08:45.631 --> 08:48.265
HERE WE GO
AND ACTION!

08:48.267 --> 08:50.601
I WANT TO ANNOUNCE
WHO THE FATHER IS.

08:50.603 --> 08:51.368
BANG.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.403
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

08:52.405 --> 08:54.338
NOBODY MOVE,
I'M A LAW OFFICER.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.507
I THINK HE'S GONE
INTO CARDIAC ARREST.

08:56.509 --> 08:59.042
YOU SEEM SOMEWHAT
UNNERVED BY THIS CHEF.

08:59.044 --> 09:00.444
ARE YOU ACCUSING
ME BARBRADY?

09:00.446 --> 09:01.712
BECAUSE
IF YOU ARE, ACCUSE,

09:01.714 --> 09:03.280
DON'T HIDE BEHIND
YOUR CLEVER RIDDLES!

09:03.282 --> 09:06.250
OUR DIFFERENCES MUST BE SET
ASIDE FOR NOW, MR. CHEF.

09:06.252 --> 09:07.418
I'M SIMPLY A MAN,

09:07.420 --> 09:08.819
A MAN TRYING
TO DO MY JOB.

09:08.821 --> 09:11.989
WOW, THIS IS
A GOOD MOVIE.

09:12.825 --> 09:16.160
( Cartman singing )

09:19.765 --> 09:21.765
DUDE, WHEN CAN WE
GET OUT OF HERE?

09:21.767 --> 09:24.101
DOCTOR,
I CAN'T FOCUS.

09:24.103 --> 09:25.669
WE'RE DOING THE BEST
WE CAN, MA'AM.

09:25.671 --> 09:26.603
THEY'VE CLOSED
THE PASS

09:26.605 --> 09:27.805
SO NONE OF THE OTHER DOCTORS
CAN GET THROUGH.

09:27.807 --> 09:29.406
FOR NOW, IT'S JUST
ME AND NURSE GOODLY.

09:29.408 --> 09:32.176
WAIT A SECOND,
THEY'VE CLOSED THE PASS?

09:32.178 --> 09:34.678
YES, I'M AFRAID WE'RE
CRITICALLY UNDERSTAFFED.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.746
UNLESS WE
GET HELP SOON,

09:35.748 --> 09:38.849
ALL THESE PEOPLE IN HERE
ARE COMPLETELY!@#$%

09:38.851 --> 09:39.950
( deep gasps )

09:39.952 --> 09:41.752
METAPHORICALLY
SPEAKING, THAT IS.

09:41.754 --> 09:42.786
WHAT ABOUT
MOFESTO?

09:42.788 --> 09:43.921
ARE YOU TAKING
CARE OF HIM?

09:43.923 --> 09:45.656
HE'S ON FULL LIFE-SUPPORT
AND BREATHING FINE.

09:45.658 --> 09:46.790
HE SHOULDN'T
NEED ANY HELP.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.459
SO LONG AS THE POWER
DOESN'T GO OUT.

09:48.461 --> 09:53.831
WHO DIDN'T SEE THAT
COMING A MILE AWAY, HUH?

09:53.833 --> 09:55.799
TONIGHT ON
"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED",

09:55.801 --> 09:58.402
A SHOOTER IS ON
THE LOOSE ON COLORADO,

09:58.404 --> 10:00.103
AND THE RESIDENTS
ARE UP IN ARMS!

10:00.105 --> 10:01.338
HERE'S YOUR HOST
JOHN WALSH.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.774
GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME
TO "AMERICA'S MOST WANTED".

10:03.776 --> 10:06.443
TONIGHT, TERROR INVADED
THE SMALL MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY

10:06.445 --> 10:07.544
OF SOUTH PARK, COLORADO.

10:07.546 --> 10:10.314
WHEN DR. ALFONSE MOFESTO
WAS GUNNED DOWN

10:10.316 --> 10:11.181
IN HIS LABORATORY,

10:11.183 --> 10:13.350
"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED"
HAS RECONSTRUCTED THIS CRIME

10:13.352 --> 10:16.320
IN HOPES THAT YOUR CALLS
CAN HELP SOLVE THE CASE.

10:16.322 --> 10:17.855
I'VE BEEN SHOT.

10:17.857 --> 10:20.190
MY GOD MR. HAT,
GET SOME HELP!

10:20.192 --> 10:21.191
RIGHT AWAY,
MR. GARRISON!

10:21.193 --> 10:24.228
NO, NO, MY LIFETIME
PARTNER AND FRIEND,

10:24.230 --> 10:27.598
GONE, TAKEN AWAY
IN THE WINK OF AN EYE...

10:27.600 --> 10:28.432
WHAT THE...

10:28.434 --> 10:30.200
ERIC ROBERTS IS
<i>IMPROV-ING</i> LINES AGAIN.

10:30.202 --> 10:32.169
I'M GONNA GET
THE MAN TO A HOSPITAL.

10:32.171 --> 10:33.036
WHO WILL HELP ME?

10:33.038 --> 10:36.039
THIS IS NOT A WORLD
I WANT TO LIVE IN...

10:38.744 --> 10:40.210
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

10:40.212 --> 10:41.545
WE'VE LOST
THE FEED TO L.A.

10:41.547 --> 10:44.648
UH, WE SEEM TO HAVE
LOST OUR LINK UP

10:44.650 --> 10:45.649
TO THE SOUTH PARK CREW.

10:45.651 --> 10:48.385
SO I GUESS WE'LL BE GOING
TO OUR FEATURE MOVIE.

10:48.387 --> 10:50.153
"WHO FRAMED
ROGER RABBIT?"

10:50.155 --> 10:52.256
( narrator )
WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?

10:52.258 --> 10:55.225
WAS IT JIMBO,
MR. GARRISON, CHEF?

10:55.227 --> 10:57.661
SOMEBODY GO SEE WHY
WE LOST THE HOOK UP.

10:57.663 --> 11:02.199
HOLY SMOKES,
THAT BLIZZARD
IS GETTING CRAZY.

11:03.369 --> 11:04.501
( screams )

11:04.503 --> 11:06.003
( nurse )
DON'T PANIC EVERYBODY,

11:06.005 --> 11:06.970
THE POWER LINES ARE DOWN

11:06.972 --> 11:09.506
BUT THE BACK-UP GENERATOR
IS RUNNING JUST FINE.

11:09.508 --> 11:11.708
NURSE, I COULD USE
SOME HELP IN HERE.

11:11.710 --> 11:12.609
COMING.

11:12.611 --> 11:14.711
LADY, IS MOFESTO
GONNA BE OKAY?

11:14.713 --> 11:15.579
YES, FOR NOW,

11:15.581 --> 11:18.015
BUT I'M AFRAID
THE GENERATOR WON'T
RUN FOR LONG.

11:18.017 --> 11:20.784
THE BATTERIES RUN OUT
IN HALF AN HOUR.

11:20.786 --> 11:21.752
TIME IS VERY SHORT.

11:21.754 --> 11:25.622
NURSE, PLEASE,
I NEED ANOTHER PAIR
OF HANDS IN HERE.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.624
SORRY.

11:27.626 --> 11:29.059
DON'T YOU SEE
GOVERNOR,

11:29.061 --> 11:31.929
I SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT
TO HAVE AN ABORTION

11:31.931 --> 11:33.196
IF I WANT ONE.

11:33.198 --> 11:34.598
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.733
I MIGHT NEED SOME
MORE CONVINCING.

11:36.735 --> 11:38.936
I MEAN, WHAT
RIGHT DO I HAVE

11:38.938 --> 11:40.237
BRINGING
ANOTHER CHILD

11:40.239 --> 11:41.872
INTO THIS
OVER-POPULATED
WORLD?

11:41.874 --> 11:43.740
THEN AGAIN I SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT

11:43.742 --> 11:44.942
BEFORE
HAVING SEX.

11:44.944 --> 11:46.677
OH, I JUST
DON'T KNOW.

11:46.679 --> 11:47.544
PLEASE MR. CHEF.

11:47.546 --> 11:49.112
I HAVE OVER 100 PEOPLE
TO TEND TO HERE.

11:49.114 --> 11:50.881
AND ONLY MYSELF
AND NURSE GOODLY.

11:50.883 --> 11:51.915
WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

11:51.917 --> 11:53.483
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SURGERY?

11:53.485 --> 11:54.518
I USED TO
WATCH "QUINCY".

11:54.520 --> 11:56.553
WHAT, WHY THE HELL
DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

11:56.555 --> 11:57.454
PUT ON SOME SCRUBS!

11:57.456 --> 11:59.590
BOYS, I'M MAKING YOU
ALL HONORARY DOCTORS.

11:59.592 --> 12:02.125
YOU CAN HELP US SAVE
THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

12:02.127 --> 12:04.161
NO WAY DUDE!

12:04.997 --> 12:08.365
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE FOR A LONG TIME.

12:08.367 --> 12:09.666
WE'RE
SNOWED IN?

12:09.668 --> 12:11.134
YES, WE'RE TRAPPED.

12:11.136 --> 12:13.070
LIKE SAILORS
ON A SUBMARINE.

12:13.072 --> 12:16.974
MY GOD, THIS IS THE WORSE
STORM I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:16.976 --> 12:18.609
I HAVE TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

12:18.611 --> 12:20.210
I HAVEN'T EATEN
SINCE BREAKFAST.

12:20.212 --> 12:22.412
YEAH, I'M GETTING
HUNGRY TOO.

12:22.414 --> 12:23.447
I HOPE YOU
ALL REALIZE

12:23.449 --> 12:24.781
WHAT WE MIGHT
BE FACING HERE.

12:24.783 --> 12:28.485
OUR ONLY OPTION MIGHT BE
TO EAT EACH OTHER

12:28.487 --> 12:30.387
TO STAY ALIVE.

12:31.156 --> 12:33.590
IT'S ONLY BEEN
LIKE FOUR HOURS.

12:33.592 --> 12:35.659
AREN'T YOU RESORTING
TO CANNIBALISM

12:35.661 --> 12:36.827
A LITTLE QUICKLY?

12:36.829 --> 12:37.861
THAT'S
THE LAW OF LAND.

12:37.863 --> 12:39.896
IT AIN'T PRETTY BUT IF
A FEW OF US MUST DIE

12:39.898 --> 12:42.299
SO THE REST CAN STAY ALIVE,
SO BE IT.

12:42.301 --> 12:45.002
BUT HOW DO
WE DECIDE WHO?

12:45.004 --> 12:45.969
WE DRAW STRAWS.

12:45.971 --> 12:47.804
WAIT A MINUTE,
WE ALL HAD A
BIG BREAKFAST.

12:47.806 --> 12:50.574
CAN'T YOU PEOPLE GO WITHOUT
EATING FOR A LITTLE WHILE?!

12:50.576 --> 12:51.575
CALM DOWN,
SOLDIER!

12:51.577 --> 12:53.644
WE NEED EVERY PERSON
HERE TO KEEP HIS HEAD.

12:53.646 --> 12:55.212
BARBRADY,
FETCH SOME STRAWS.

12:55.214 --> 12:57.648
WELL WHO THE HELL
MADE YOU THE BOSS ANYWAY?

12:57.650 --> 13:00.450
( narrator )
WHO THE HELL
MADE JIMBO BOSS?

13:00.452 --> 13:04.021
WAS IT BARBRADY,
CHEF, MR...

13:04.156 --> 13:05.522
THIS MAN'S
APPENDIX HAS BURST!

13:05.524 --> 13:07.157
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO OPERATE NOW

13:07.159 --> 13:08.158
WITH OUR
LIMITED POWER.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.693
I NEED YOU ALL
TO BE STRONG FOR ME.

13:09.695 --> 13:12.062
NURSE GOODLY WILL
TAKE CARE OF THE ANESTHESIA.

13:12.064 --> 13:13.397
CHEF, YOU ACT
AS HER ARMS.

13:13.399 --> 13:16.199
BOYS, YOU HAVE TO HELP
WITH SUCTION AND BANDAGES.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.100
READY?

13:17.102 --> 13:17.668
NO.

13:17.670 --> 13:21.038
I'LL MAKE AN INCISION
OVER THE HEART.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.407
OH, BOY.

13:26.078 --> 13:28.211
YOU BARFED
INTO THE INCISION.

13:28.213 --> 13:29.112
SWEET!

13:29.114 --> 13:31.014
SUCTION!

13:31.717 --> 13:33.684
HEY, THEY'RE SCREWING
WITH THE LIGHTS.

13:33.686 --> 13:35.952
( narrator )
WHO IS SCREWING
WITH THE LIGHTS?

13:35.954 --> 13:38.188
IS IT BARBRADY,
OR JIMBO,

13:38.190 --> 13:40.724
OR THE 1991
DENVER BRONCOS?

13:40.726 --> 13:43.627
THAT IS REALLY STARTING
TO PISS ME OFF.

13:44.630 --> 13:45.662
ALRIGHT, SO FAR,

13:45.664 --> 13:47.864
EVERYBODY HAS
A LONG PIECE OF STRAW.

13:47.866 --> 13:49.332
WE'LL KEEP DRAWING.

13:49.334 --> 13:50.867
WHEW!

13:51.203 --> 13:52.736
WHEW!

13:53.772 --> 13:54.905
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:54.907 --> 13:56.673
WHERE THE HELL
IS THE SHORT ONE?

13:56.675 --> 13:58.041
THE SHORT WHAT?

13:58.043 --> 13:59.209
DAMMIT, BARBRADY!

13:59.211 --> 14:00.143
WHEN YOU
DRAW STRAWS

14:00.145 --> 14:01.712
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE ONE OF THEM SHORT!

14:01.714 --> 14:03.413
THAT'S HOW
YOU DECIDE WHO LOSES.

14:03.415 --> 14:05.082
THAT'S NOT
HOW I PLAYED IT.

14:05.084 --> 14:09.352
HURRY THIS UP, MY
STOMACH IS GROWLING.

14:09.922 --> 14:11.955
I FOUND A MAP THAT
SHOWS THE LOCATION

14:11.957 --> 14:12.956
OF A BACK-UP GENERATOR.

14:12.958 --> 14:15.025
APPARENTLY THEY BUILT
SELF SUSTAINING GENERATOR

14:15.027 --> 14:16.827
FOR JUST THIS KIND
OF EMERGENCY.

14:16.829 --> 14:18.862
BUT IT'S OUT AND
AWAY FROM THE HOSPITAL.

14:18.864 --> 14:20.130
SO HOW DO
WE GET TO IT?

14:20.132 --> 14:21.965
WE MUST SPLIT UP
INTO TWO TEAMS.

14:21.967 --> 14:23.033
TEAM "A" AND TEAM "B".

14:23.035 --> 14:26.036
TEAM "A" WILL CONSIST
OF MYSELF, STAN, KYLE,

14:26.038 --> 14:28.038
ERIC, CHEF
AND NURSE GOODLY.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.474
TEAM "B" WILL
CONSIST OF KENNY.

14:30.476 --> 14:31.608
NOW LISTEN
CLOSELY TEAM "B".

14:31.610 --> 14:34.077
YOUR GOAL WILL BE TO TURN ON
THE BACK-UP GENERATOR.

14:34.079 --> 14:36.113
TO DO THIS YOU MUST
BRAVE THE STORM OUTSIDE

14:36.115 --> 14:37.180
AND GET INTO
THIS SEWAGE DUCT.

14:37.182 --> 14:39.382
MEANWHILE, TEAM "A" WILL
GO TO THE HOLDING AREA HERE

14:39.384 --> 14:41.518
WHERE THIS IS A TELEVISION
AND SOME COCOA.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.653
WE WILL DRINK THE COCOA AND
WATCH FAMILY PROGRAMMING

14:43.655 --> 14:46.389
UNTIL TEAM "B" MAKES IT
THROUGH THE SEWAGE DUCT.

14:46.391 --> 14:47.958
BY THAT TIME,
TEAM "B",

14:47.960 --> 14:49.059
REMEMBER,
THAT'S YOU KENNY,

14:49.061 --> 14:50.727
SHOULD REACH THE OUTER
CORE OF THE GENERATOR.

14:50.729 --> 14:52.629
IT WILL BE A COLD AND
DANGEROUS CLIMB TO THE TOP.

14:52.631 --> 14:54.998
AND THERE COULD
<i>VELOCIRAPTORS</i> HERE.

14:55.000 --> 14:55.999
ONCE YOU
REACH THE TOP

14:56.001 --> 14:57.534
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GET A CLEAR VIEW

14:57.536 --> 14:58.668
THROUGH
THIS WINDOW OF US,

14:58.670 --> 15:00.036
DRINKING COCOA AND
WATCHING TELEVISION.

15:00.038 --> 15:02.739
THEN YOU CAN PROCEED
DOWN INTO THE GENERATOR

15:02.741 --> 15:03.740
AND POWER IT ON.

15:03.742 --> 15:04.908
ARE THERE ANY
QUESTIONS?

15:04.910 --> 15:07.110
NO, THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY SWEET TO ME.

15:07.112 --> 15:08.678
RIGHT, THEN
LET'S DO IT.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.113
GO TEAM.

15:12.384 --> 15:14.818
I CAN'T GO ON...

15:14.820 --> 15:16.486
...SO HUNGRY.

15:16.488 --> 15:19.923
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE
IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE.

15:19.925 --> 15:23.593
WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ENERGY
TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.

15:23.595 --> 15:24.995
WE HAVE TO EAT.

15:24.997 --> 15:25.796
HOW CAN WE?

15:25.798 --> 15:27.497
HOW CAN WE LIVE
WITH OURSELVES?

15:27.499 --> 15:29.366
THERE'S ONLY
ONE ANSWER.

15:29.368 --> 15:31.601
EAT ERIC ROBERTS!

15:32.304 --> 15:33.503
YES, OF COURSE,

15:33.505 --> 15:36.239
NOBODY GIVES A!@#$%
ABOUT ERIC ROBERTS.

15:36.241 --> 15:38.441
EAT ERIC ROBERTS!

15:39.278 --> 15:43.280
NO, NO PLEASE!

15:43.282 --> 15:44.614
( buzzing )

15:44.616 --> 15:47.517
WELL, THERE'S NO
GOING BACK NOW,

15:47.519 --> 15:50.687
WE'RE CANNIBALS,
GOD SAVE US.

15:50.689 --> 15:53.356
GOD WANTS YOU TO
LIVE, MAYOR, FIGHT.

15:53.358 --> 15:54.724
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
ERIC ROBERTS

15:54.726 --> 15:56.593
WAS MUCH JUICIER
THAN I EXPECTED.

15:56.595 --> 15:58.929
THIS SNOW JUST
ISN'T LETTING UP.

15:58.931 --> 16:01.131
WE'RE GONNA DIE
HERE, I KNOW IT!

16:01.133 --> 16:02.632
WHAT TIME IS IT,
BARBRADY?

16:02.634 --> 16:04.401
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.

16:04.403 --> 16:06.937
I CAN'T GO ON.

16:06.939 --> 16:08.438
WE'LL GIVE THE STORM
ANOTHER HOUR.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.441
AFTER THAT WE MIGHT
HAVE TO EAT AGAIN.

16:11.443 --> 16:12.142
WHAT?

16:12.144 --> 16:14.678
ARE YOU PEOPLE
DIABETIC OR SOMETHING?

16:17.049 --> 16:19.883
Team "b",
come in team "b".

16:19.885 --> 16:21.218
( mumbling )

16:21.220 --> 16:22.052
LISTEN TEAM "B",

16:22.054 --> 16:23.420
WE FOUND ANOTHER
PATH TO THE GENERATOR.

16:23.422 --> 16:25.622
There's actually a nice
heated walkway to it,

16:25.624 --> 16:29.059
SO YOU DON'T NEED TO WALK
THROUGH ALL THAT SEWAGE.

16:29.995 --> 16:32.229
( mumbling )

16:32.231 --> 16:34.297
OH, WELL FORGET
I SAID THAT THEN.

16:34.299 --> 16:36.199
LISTEN TEAM "B",
YOU SHOULD BE SEEING

16:36.201 --> 16:37.834
a large drift of snow
with some metal

16:37.836 --> 16:40.103
sticking out of it
just to your left.

16:40.105 --> 16:41.037
( mumbling )

16:41.039 --> 16:43.073
GOOD, HEAD
TOWARDS IT.

16:43.075 --> 16:44.140
TEAM "A" OUT.

16:44.142 --> 16:45.942
WHAT IF MOFESTO
NEVER WAKES UP?

16:45.944 --> 16:48.979
AND I NEVER FIND OUT
WHO MY FATHER IS?

16:50.582 --> 16:52.782
( growling )

16:55.854 --> 16:57.621
MY GOD, WHAT A
HARROWING TALE

16:57.623 --> 16:59.155
OF HUMAN DRAMA
THIS IS!

16:59.157 --> 17:01.925
ALL OF US DOING WHAT
WE MUST TO SURVIVE.

17:01.927 --> 17:04.961
IT IS AMAZING WHAT PEOPLE
CAN DO UNDER STRESS.

17:04.963 --> 17:06.229
JUST LOOK AT
THE PYRAMIDS.

17:06.231 --> 17:08.164
NOBODY KNOWS HOW
THEY BUILT THOSE,

17:08.166 --> 17:08.999
OR WHO.

17:09.001 --> 17:10.834
( narrator )
WHO BUILT THE PYRAMIDS?

17:10.836 --> 17:12.736
WAS IT
THE BABYLONIANS?

17:12.738 --> 17:14.004
OFFICER BARBRADY?

17:14.006 --> 17:15.238
SAMARITANS?

17:15.240 --> 17:17.407
( mumbling )

17:17.409 --> 17:18.275
ROGER TEAM "B".

17:18.277 --> 17:19.476
HE'S REACHED
THE BACK-UP
GENERATOR.

17:19.478 --> 17:22.579
TEAM "B", CAN YOU SEE
THE TWO COPPER NODES?

17:22.581 --> 17:23.546
GOOD.

17:23.548 --> 17:25.682
NOW IS THERE A
WIRE CONNECTING THEM?

17:25.684 --> 17:27.350
( mumbling )

17:27.352 --> 17:29.386
DAMN, THE WIRE CONNECTING
THE NODES IS GONE.

17:29.388 --> 17:31.521
WE NEED TO COMPLETE
THE CIRCUIT BETWEEN THEM

17:31.523 --> 17:32.455
OR WE'RE SCREWED.

17:32.457 --> 17:33.623
DO YOU HAVE
ANY WIRE HERE?

17:33.625 --> 17:34.491
THERE'S NO TIME.

17:34.493 --> 17:35.625
ONCE THESE LIGHTS
FLICKER OUT

17:35.627 --> 17:38.161
ALL THESE PATIENTS ON
LIFE SUPPORT ARE GONNA DIE.

17:38.163 --> 17:39.629
( mumbling )

17:39.631 --> 17:40.931
NO KENNY,
YOU CAN'T.

17:40.933 --> 17:42.299
THERE MUST BE
SOME OTHER WAY.

17:42.301 --> 17:43.667
HE'S GONNA MAKE
THE CONNECTION

17:43.669 --> 17:45.201
HIMSELF WITH
HIS HANDS.

17:45.203 --> 17:46.469
NO, HE'LL DIE.

17:46.471 --> 17:47.337
GO KENNY!

17:47.339 --> 17:49.940
KENNY, NO!

17:51.910 --> 17:54.077
OH MY GOD,
THEY'VE KILLED KENNY.

17:54.079 --> 17:55.512
YOU BASTARDS!

17:55.514 --> 17:57.113
THE POWER!

17:57.115 --> 17:59.316
QUICKLY, GET
THE SCANNER
RUNNING AGAIN.

17:59.318 --> 18:02.519
WE'VE GOT
A CHANCE NOW.

18:02.955 --> 18:05.155
WELL OKAY
MRS. CARTMAN,

18:05.157 --> 18:08.425
I'LL LEGALIZE 40TH
TRIMESTER ABORTIONS FOR YOU.

18:08.427 --> 18:10.293
OH, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

18:10.295 --> 18:13.263
WE'LL HAVE THE PREGNANCY
TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY.

18:13.265 --> 18:14.631
TERMINATED?

18:14.633 --> 18:16.700
YES, THAT'S WHAT
AN ABORTION IS.

18:16.702 --> 18:18.368
NO, I DIDN'T
MEAN THAT.

18:18.370 --> 18:20.737
I MEANT THE OTHER
THING YOU CAN DO.

18:20.739 --> 18:22.672
WHAT'S THAT
OTHER "A" WORD?

18:22.674 --> 18:23.673
ADOPTION?

18:23.675 --> 18:25.642
YES, THAT'S
WHAT I MEAN,

18:25.644 --> 18:26.443
ADOPTION.

18:26.445 --> 18:28.078
WELL, THAT'S
PRETTY DIFFERENT.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.946
I SHOULD JUST
TELL MY SON THE TRUTH

18:29.948 --> 18:31.548
ABOUT EVERYTHING MYSELF.

18:31.550 --> 18:33.216
GOOD DAY
MR. PRESIDENT.

18:36.655 --> 18:37.587
WELL, WE MADE IT.

18:37.589 --> 18:39.389
THE POWER IS ON
THE SNOW IS MELTING,

18:39.391 --> 18:41.691
YOUR FRIEND MOFESTO
IS DOING FINE.

18:41.693 --> 18:43.626
WHERE, WHERE AM I?

18:43.628 --> 18:45.996
YOU'RE AT
THE HOSPITAL, MOFESTO.

18:45.998 --> 18:46.796
YOU WERE SHOT.

18:46.798 --> 18:48.898
WE DON'T KNOW WHO
TRIED TO SHOOT YOU.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.167
I'M SURE IT WAS
MY BROTHER AGAIN.

18:51.169 --> 18:53.370
HE TRIES TO SHOOT
ME EVERY MONTH.

18:53.372 --> 18:53.970
OH.

18:53.972 --> 18:54.971
WHERE'S THE
LITTLE FAT BOY?

18:54.973 --> 18:56.339
HE'LL BE DELIGHTED
THAT MOFESTO IS AWAKE.

18:56.341 --> 18:57.841
HE WENT OFF LOOKING
FOR MR. KENNY.

18:57.843 --> 19:00.510
HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND
AND I'LL MISS HIM.

19:00.512 --> 19:01.411
HE WAS VERY BRAVE.

19:01.413 --> 19:03.146
HE RISKED HIS LIFE
SO THAT MOFESTO CAN LIVE.

19:03.148 --> 19:06.583
YEAH AND NOW HE'S
A FREEZY-POP.

19:07.319 --> 19:09.886
DUDE, DO YOU THINK
IF WE HIT HIM WITH A SHOVEL

19:09.888 --> 19:10.653
HE'D SHATTER?

19:10.655 --> 19:13.056
I DON'T KNOW
LET'S FIND OUT.

19:18.296 --> 19:20.330
IT'S OVER.

19:20.332 --> 19:21.164
WE'RE FREE.

19:21.166 --> 19:23.900
YES, BUT AT WHAT COST,
MR. GARRISON?

19:23.902 --> 19:25.335
AT WHAT COST?

19:25.337 --> 19:26.436
LISTEN
EVERYBODY,

19:26.438 --> 19:28.104
WE DID WHAT WE
HAD TO IN THERE.

19:28.106 --> 19:31.474
BUT, HOW WILL LIVE
WITH OURSELVES NOW?

19:31.476 --> 19:33.943
ONE DAY AT
A TIME, MAYOR,

19:33.945 --> 19:36.212
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

19:36.214 --> 19:45.922
♪ AVA MARIA ♪

19:45.924 --> 19:48.725
I'M BRINGING HOME
SOME ERIC ROBERTS
IN A DOGGIE BAG.

19:48.727 --> 19:51.961
DOES ANYBODY
ELSE WANT SOME?

19:51.963 --> 19:53.496
I'M GLAD YOU
COULD ALL COME.

19:53.498 --> 19:54.364
I CAN FINALLY REVEAL

19:54.366 --> 19:55.932
WHO THE FATHER OF
ERIC CARTMAN IS.

19:55.934 --> 19:58.401
BUT FIRST I WANT TO
THANK KENNY McCORMICK

19:58.403 --> 19:59.936
FOR SACRIFICING
HIS LIFE...

19:59.938 --> 20:01.404
JUST TELL US,
ALREADY!

20:01.406 --> 20:02.305
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

20:02.307 --> 20:04.274
THE FATHER OF
ERIC CARTMAN IS...

20:04.276 --> 20:05.308
SAY DID ANYBODY
SEE THAT

20:05.310 --> 20:07.077
"TERRANCE AND PHILLIP SPECIAL"
LAST MONTH?

20:07.079 --> 20:08.244
WASN'T THAT
JUST THE FUNNIEST...

20:08.246 --> 20:10.580
STOP IT, TELL ME
WHO MY FATHER IS!!!

20:10.582 --> 20:11.714
AS I SAID BEFORE,

20:11.716 --> 20:14.484
THE FATHER IS
SOMEBODY IN THIS ROOM.

20:14.486 --> 20:16.986
THE FATHER IS...

20:16.988 --> 20:18.721
MRS. CARTMAN.

20:18.723 --> 20:20.023
WHAT?

20:20.025 --> 20:21.157
YES, IT'S TRUE.

20:21.159 --> 20:23.493
NO, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

20:23.495 --> 20:25.395
YES, IT TOOK QUITE
A WHILE FOR ME

20:25.397 --> 20:26.362
TO UNDERSTAND
AS WELL.

20:26.364 --> 20:29.766
YOU SEE MRS. CARTMAN
IS A HERMAPHRODITE.

20:29.768 --> 20:31.101
MEANING WHAT?

20:31.103 --> 20:35.438
MEANING THAT SHE HAS BOTH
MALE AND FEMALE GENITALS.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.573
IT'S TRUE.

20:36.575 --> 20:37.807
YOU MEAN AT
THE DRUNKEN BARN DANCE

20:37.809 --> 20:40.176
WHEN WE ALL GOT
TOGETHER WITH HER,

20:40.178 --> 20:41.945
SHE WAS A HE?

20:41.947 --> 20:45.882
NO, NO, NOT EXACTLY,
BUT SHE DID HAVE A PENIS.

20:46.585 --> 20:48.785
THE FACT OF THE MATTER
IS HERMAPHRODITES

20:48.787 --> 20:50.086
CANNOT BEAR CHILDREN,

20:50.088 --> 20:51.855
SO MISS CARTMAN'S
DNA MATCH WITH ERIC

20:51.857 --> 20:53.923
CAN ONLY MEAN THAT
SHE IS HIS FATHER

20:53.925 --> 20:56.025
AND SHE GOT
ANOTHER WOMAN PREGNANT

20:56.027 --> 20:57.727
AT THE DRUNKEN
BARN DANCE.

20:57.729 --> 21:00.263
MAN, THIS
IS!@#$% WEAK.

21:00.265 --> 21:01.731
DUDE, YOU'RE
A BIG FAT ASS

21:01.733 --> 21:03.266
AND YOUR MOM'S
A HERMAPHRODITE.

21:03.268 --> 21:05.335
I'M SORRY, I NEVER
TOLD YOU'RE ERIC.

21:05.337 --> 21:06.269
I JUST THOUGHT

21:06.271 --> 21:08.505
MAYBE IT WOULD BE
A LITTLE SHOCKING TO YOU.

21:08.507 --> 21:10.573
OH WOW, GEE,
YOU THINK SO MOM?

21:10.575 --> 21:12.976
WELL, THAT'S THAT,
THANK YOU ALL FOR PLAYING.

21:12.978 --> 21:14.077
NO, NO,
WAIT A MINUTE.

21:14.079 --> 21:17.213
IF SHE'S MY DAD,
THEN WHO'S MY MOM?

21:17.215 --> 21:19.983
( narrator )
WHO IS ERIC CARTMAN'S MOTHER?

21:19.985 --> 21:21.751
IS IT MRS. CRABTREE?

21:21.753 --> 21:23.019
SHEILA BROSLOVSKI?

21:23.021 --> 21:24.053
THE MAYOR?

21:24.055 --> 21:26.856
OH, FORGET IT!
