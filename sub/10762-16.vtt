WEBVTT

00:08.074 --> 00:11.077
Gosh, it's been such fun

00:11.077 --> 00:13.079
talking about
psychopharmacological solutions

00:13.079 --> 00:15.081
to maladaptive
personality traits

00:15.081 --> 00:17.984
that I can't believe
the three hours is almost gone.

00:17.984 --> 00:20.420
Up next is the news
followed by...

00:20.920 --> 00:23.690
Oh... Roz is reminding me

00:23.690 --> 00:28.895
that next Saturday is the first
annual KACL AIDS Bike-a-thon.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.463
It's bound to be an afternoon

00:30.964 --> 00:33.466
of family, fun
and lots of surprises.

00:33.967 --> 00:39.439
So dust off your velocipedes,
and I'll see you there.

00:39.439 --> 00:40.940
Great pitch, Doc.

00:40.940 --> 00:42.308
So what are the surprises?

00:42.776 --> 00:45.845
Well, first and foremost, I'm not going.

00:45.845 --> 00:47.747
But you just told them
you'd see them there.

00:48.114 --> 00:50.183
Roz, I'm merely getting
the rubes into the tent.

00:50.683 --> 00:51.684
I will gladly give my money,

00:51.684 --> 00:53.686
but spending the afternoon
riding bicycles

00:53.686 --> 00:55.989
with a bunch of hooligans
is not my idea of fun.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.091
It's just kids and families.

00:58.324 --> 01:00.894
Yes, well, so was the KACL
family picnic at the zoo,

01:00.894 --> 01:04.798
until those urchins jostled me
into the orangutan grove.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.699
Let me tell you,

01:06.699 --> 01:10.670
orangutans are not the playful
gentlemen of the trees

01:10.670 --> 01:12.672
the nature shows claim.

01:12.672 --> 01:13.640
Hello.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.175
Hey, Julia.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.177
You're going to
the Bike-a-thon, right?

01:17.177 --> 01:19.012
Oh, don't embarrass her, Kenny.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.848
It's got to be tough
finding a comfortable bike seat

01:21.848 --> 01:24.184
when you're such a tight-ass
.

01:24.184 --> 01:29.289
This from a woman who peddles
her ass all over town.

01:29.289 --> 01:30.523
Okay, lady...
Yes, all right
Stalemate.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.493
Well done, well done, keep moving, come on.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.562
So, Bike-a-thon--
you're in, right?

01:35.562 --> 01:36.996
Nah, I can't be bothered.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.532
I'll just send a check.

01:39.532 --> 01:41.468
Aw, cheese and rice,
what's wrong with you people?

01:41.468 --> 01:43.436
Relax, Kenny,
I'm just pulling your leg.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.938
How can I not go?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.740
This is funding AIDS research,
for God's sake.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.075
I know you think
I'm heartless

01:49.075 --> 01:50.376
and self-centered,

01:50.376 --> 01:52.576
but at least give me credit
for being human.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.883
What?

01:56.883 --> 01:58.885
Kenny... (chuckles)

01:58.885 --> 02:00.353
Come on.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.255
I was pulling your leg, too.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.090
(laughs):
Come on.

02:04.090 --> 02:04.891
I'll tell you what.

02:05.391 --> 02:08.728
We should have a fund-raiser
for your sense of humor.

02:08.728 --> 02:09.596
(guffaws)

02:09.596 --> 02:12.599
All right, I'll see you there.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.566
You're pathetic.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.068
I know

02:19.706 --> 02:21.207
Hold it!

02:26.713 --> 02:27.714
Cora, hi.

02:28.214 --> 02:29.015
Marty.

02:35.288 --> 02:36.789
Visiting your son?

02:36.789 --> 02:37.790
Yes.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.730
Cora, I'm sorry,
but I got to ask you.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.665
What happened?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.667
I thought we had
a pretty nice thing,

02:47.667 --> 02:49.102
but then you stopped
returning my calls.

02:49.469 --> 02:52.005
Why don't you ask
your other girlfriend?

02:52.438 --> 02:54.007
What other girlfriend?

02:54.440 --> 02:57.977
That bizarre English lady who
told me to leave you alone...

02:59.779 --> 03:01.848
...because she was in
the British Secret Service

03:01.848 --> 03:03.783
and had a license to kill.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.686
Here's your stop.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.689
Oh, geez!
That was Daphne's mother.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.059
She had a thing for me,
but it was never mutual.

03:13.059 --> 03:14.460
Did she show you a badge?

03:14.460 --> 03:17.397
Always ask to see a badge.

03:17.397 --> 03:20.366
I knew she wasn't
a secret agent.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.670
But she was pretty convincing
about the two of you.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.471
Oh, Cora, I'm so sorry.

03:25.471 --> 03:28.241
It's not true.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.477
I'm sorry, too.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.514
I should have
asked about her.

03:34.514 --> 03:37.016
Well, hey,
it's cleared up now.

03:37.016 --> 03:40.019
Maybe we could pick up
where we left off.

03:40.019 --> 03:43.356
Or skip ahead.
Your choice.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.158
That would've been nice

03:45.658 --> 03:47.460
but I've been
seeing someone lately.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.761
Oh, well, sure.
Of course you have.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.196
Stupid of me.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.665
But I'm very
 glad to see you again.

03:52.665 --> 03:54.167
Please give Eddie my love.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.668
Oh, yeah.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.470
He'll be sorry
he missed you.

03:57.470 --> 04:00.206
He liked your ankles.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:13.219 --> 04:15.221
Oh, sorry for
the holdup, guys.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.723
Listen, I think it's best

04:16.723 --> 04:18.725
if we take separate cars
to the flower show.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.560
Later, I have to go
buy a bicycle.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.328
NILES:
For whom?

04:22.328 --> 04:24.197
Well, for me.

04:24.197 --> 04:28.134
I've beendragooned into riding
for the KACL AIDS Bike-a-thon.

04:28.134 --> 04:31.070
Poor devil.
Spending a day on a bike.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.073
I don't envy you.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.408
DAPHNE:
Niles...

04:35.808 --> 04:38.211
why don't we enter
the Bike-a-thon.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.750
You had to see that coming.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.419
We can all go to the shop
together after the flower show.

04:46.686 --> 04:47.754
Sure, why not?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.756
You two would look so cute

04:50.256 --> 04:51.257
on matching bicycles.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.259
Well, I guess it would be
a kick, eh, Frasier?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.261
Not you two, you nit.

04:55.261 --> 04:56.663
You and Daphne.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.434
You!

05:01.434 --> 05:02.769
Hello.

05:02.769 --> 05:03.770
I just had
a very interesting

05:03.770 --> 05:05.772
conversation with Cora Winston.

05:05.772 --> 05:09.242
Seems someone claiming to be
my girlfriend scared her off.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.677
Oh, dear.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.145
Is she the woman
from the bookstore?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.147
No.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.649
The bookstore?!

05:16.649 --> 05:18.117
Mum, is this true?

05:18.618 --> 05:21.421
Well, I'm sure I don't
 know what Marty's talking about

05:21.421 --> 05:23.556
but it was probably back
when we were an item.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.958
We were never an item!

05:25.958 --> 05:26.959
Now I would like for you
to leave.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.361
Now, Dad, calm down.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.763
Listen, I'm sure you can talk this over with Cora

05:30.763 --> 05:32.265
and have a good laugh after it.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.067
Ha, ha.
Very funny.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.302
Now that she's practically married to this guy.

05:36.302 --> 05:37.804
Oh, Martin, I'm sorry.

05:38.304 --> 05:39.305
I guess I didn't realize..

05:39.305 --> 05:40.807
Apology not accepted.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.109
You went too far.
We are no longer speaking.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.445
Marty...
No, no, Mrs. Moon,
Mrs. Moon...

05:45.445 --> 05:46.946
shut up.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.352
Uh, Dad, we're leaving now

05:52.752 --> 05:54.120
We're going over
to the flower show,

05:54.120 --> 05:55.388
then, after that,
we're gonna go

05:55.388 --> 05:56.889
to a sporting goods store
and buy a couple of bikes.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.892
Nice try, Frasier,
but I'm too mad to laugh

06:06.065 --> 06:07.633
Uh, well, this one
has good lines.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.469
You have any
without this bar here?

06:12.338 --> 06:14.240
You mean girls' bikes? Sure.

06:14.574 --> 06:18.511
Good. 'Cause my wifeâ€™s a girl and she'll need one of those.

06:18.845 --> 06:19.912
Right.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.347
Maybe I'll go see
how she's doing.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.418
Niles, we can't stall much longer.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.920
I mean, one seems
as good as the next.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.888
Is there anything else we need?

06:29.288 --> 06:31.357
Hmm, let me see...
Oh, yes, I know.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.859
We need to know
how to ride them!

06:32.859 --> 06:34.761
Shh! Shh! Shh!

06:35.128 --> 06:36.462
We will learn.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.663
Oh, as easy as that?

06:38.030 --> 06:39.098
Look at these machines,
Frasier.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.467
These are bicycles.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.336
There's nothing between
you and the ground
but the ground itself.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.670
Yes.

06:44.937 --> 06:47.707
And if a child of four
can ride one, then so can we.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.977
That's what we said
when we were six.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.413
If Daphne finds out,
she'll probably...

06:54.414 --> 06:57.350
Metal spokes.
I like that.

06:57.717 --> 06:59.786
Guess you buy the horn
separately.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.892
That was close.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.928
Niles, I am not going to look like an idiot

07:08.928 --> 07:10.196
at that Bike-a-thon.

07:10.396 --> 07:12.465
Tonight, I'm going to a parking lot

07:12.465 --> 07:13.966
and come hell or high water,

07:14.467 --> 07:16.969
I am going
to master cycling.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.938
You're welcome to join me.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.441
I guess I could sneak out.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.409
Perhaps it's time
to slay the dragon.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.877
That's the stuff, brother.

07:25.244 --> 07:29.749
Call me crazy,
but I like a bouncy tire.

07:29.749 --> 07:34.220
Two bouncy tires and a taut chain.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.989
That's good ridin'.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.759
Where did you
learn all that?

07:40.259 --> 07:42.762
That was really good.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.263
It's a matter
of confidence, Niles.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.199
Hmm!

07:47.633 --> 07:49.101
(groans)

07:50.603 --> 07:53.039
All a matter of
confidence, he says.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.442
Well, perhaps two people who
don't know how to ride bikes

07:56.442 --> 07:59.479
shouldn't try
to teach each other.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.380
A good teacher doesn't
yell at his student.

08:01.380 --> 08:05.117
Nor does a good teacher
throw a stick at his student.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.420
I thought it would
make you try harder.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.122
Oh, you're going to make
a hell of a dad.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.958
What are we going to do?

08:11.958 --> 08:13.292
Let's not panic.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.294
We still have two days
before the Bike-a-thon.

08:15.294 --> 08:19.198
Surely the library has shelves
devoted to this topic.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.600
I don't have time for that

08:20.600 --> 08:23.369
Daphne wants to go biking
tomorrow afternoon.

08:23.369 --> 08:27.206
Then you'll just have to tell
her you don't know how to ride

08:27.206 --> 08:28.207
If I was going to do that,

08:28.207 --> 08:29.709
I should've done it
at the bike store.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.711
But no...!

08:31.711 --> 08:33.078
You...!

08:33.078 --> 08:34.981
You said we could teach
ourselves.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.948
You said no one
would be the wiser.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.284
Niles...
Two bouncy tires

08:38.284 --> 08:39.619
and a taut chain, you said.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.120
And now look!

08:41.120 --> 08:43.589
My spokes are bent,
my pants are stuck,

08:43.589 --> 08:44.991
there's blood
on the headlight!

08:44.991 --> 08:45.825
There's blood everywhere!

08:45.825 --> 08:48.794
Niles, Niles, Niles.

08:48.794 --> 08:52.798
Niles, that wasn't your fault.

08:52.798 --> 08:57.703
That jogger should've
been wearing a reflective vest.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.639
Come on... come and sit down.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.641
I'm going to get you a nice sherry.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.185
Hi, Frasier.
Oh, hi, Roz.

09:13.185 --> 09:15.187
You're welcome
to join me and Niles.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.188
Oh, I can't.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.691
I'm on my way to meet Alice and her sitter

09:18.691 --> 09:21.694
Alice wants to practice riding her bicycle for Saturday.

09:21.694 --> 09:22.628
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.030
She loves it.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.032
She had that bike one day

09:26.032 --> 09:29.535
before she made me
take her training wheels off.

09:29.969 --> 09:32.538
Tell me, does she ever
find that she feels

09:33.039 --> 09:37.043
as though her feet
are frozen to the pedals...

09:37.043 --> 09:40.046
stuck in a confused,
arrhythmic battle

09:40.046 --> 09:42.048
between forward
and reverse,

09:42.048 --> 09:45.051
until finally,
with no locomotive
momentum whatsoever,

09:45.551 --> 09:47.420
she keels over
like a felled tree?

09:47.753 --> 09:49.322
I don't think so.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.823
Oh, good, good,

09:50.823 --> 09:52.825
because that's
a real thing

09:52.825 --> 09:54.260
that happens
to some kids.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.763
DAPHNE:
Hey, Frasier.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.765
Oh, hi, Daph.
Mrs. Moon.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.267
Niles, darling

10:01.267 --> 10:03.269
I'm afraid I
 have some bad news.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.103
NILES:
What is it?

10:04.103 --> 10:07.707
Someone stole our new bikes.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.509
My God, are you sure?

10:10.509 --> 10:11.377
Can I get a refill?

10:11.377 --> 10:14.747
That's terrible.

10:14.747 --> 10:15.615
That's curious, Niles.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.949
Didn't that salesman say

10:16.949 --> 10:19.852
that nothing could break
those titanium locks?

10:19.852 --> 10:21.287
You're right.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.289
I must not have locked them
properly.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.126
Foolish Niles.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.462
You know, I spotted
a couple of bikes

10:29.462 --> 10:31.464
in the storage room
behind the furnace.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.466
Perhaps you could borrow those.

10:33.899 --> 10:34.967
No, I don't think so.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.436
The theft has soured me
on the whole bike experience.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.438
And what were you doing
behind the furnace, anyway?

10:39.872 --> 10:42.141
Drinking.

10:42.408 --> 10:45.478
Hello, Daphne,
Niles, Frasier.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.479
Hello, Martin.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.481
How are the three
of you doing?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.483
Mind if I join you?

10:50.483 --> 10:51.384
NILES:
Sure.

10:51.717 --> 10:54.153
Oh, you're not still angry,
are you?

10:54.553 --> 10:57.623
Coffee, please.

10:57.623 --> 11:01.127
Hi. Well, everybody's
here today.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.028
Yeah.

11:02.028 --> 11:02.828
Grab a seat.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.331
I'd love to have
a lady sit next to me.

11:05.765 --> 11:06.332
ROZ:
Well, thanks. I can't.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.733
I'm on my way to the park.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.669
I just got a call
from the baby-sitter.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.170
Alice did a wheelie!

11:11.170 --> 11:13.673
(all exclaiming)

11:13.673 --> 11:15.675
Well, I'll see you guys later.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.009
That's great, Roz.
Bye-bye.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.279
Well, someone's raising
a real little showoff.

11:20.279 --> 11:23.716
Now, now, not everyone
was meant to ride a bike.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.217
What does that mean?

11:25.217 --> 11:27.219
Well, I'm just saying
that my boys

11:27.219 --> 11:28.721
are good at other things.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.156
Indoor things.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.894
Oh, no.

11:34.894 --> 11:35.861
You don't mean...

11:36.295 --> 11:37.363
Yes, Daphne.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.131
Frasier doesn't know
how to ride a bike.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.967
Well, neither do you!

11:42.168 --> 11:42.735
Frasier!

11:43.235 --> 11:45.204
Well, she was bound
to find out!

11:45.604 --> 11:47.039
We never learned.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.374
I tried teaching them,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.376
but I had to take them to
the hospital so many times

11:50.376 --> 11:53.813
Social Services starte
d sniffing around.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.917
All these years,
it's been our secret shame.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.386
Yes, and it hasn't been easy concealing it, either.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.887
People are always saying,
in conversation,

12:01.887 --> 12:03.322
"It's just like riding a bike."

12:04.623 --> 12:07.526
I can smile and nod...

12:07.526 --> 12:11.397
but I only understand it
in theory.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.067
We tried to teach ourselves
to ride last night.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.069
Oh, can you imagine
a sadder tableau?

12:17.069 --> 12:19.071
Two grown men
trying to gain mastery

12:19.071 --> 12:20.840
over a child's toy

12:20.840 --> 12:22.141
and failing miserably.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.509
Even more pathetic

12:23.509 --> 12:25.377
a grown man
faking the theft

12:25.377 --> 12:27.379
of his and his
wife's bicycles.

12:27.379 --> 12:30.883
I disgust myself!

12:30.883 --> 12:32.384
I'm so sorry, Daphne.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.386
Niles, you've no
 need to apologize.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.888
Lots of people
don't know how to ride.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.156
Really?

12:37.156 --> 12:38.257
Who?

12:38.257 --> 12:40.559
It doesn't matter.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.995
I can take you to the park
and teach you.

12:42.995 --> 12:43.896
I'll teach you both.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.731
Yeah.
Really, Daphne?

12:45.731 --> 12:47.600
Daphne, I adore you!

12:47.600 --> 12:50.536
No, seriously. Who?

12:51.937 --> 12:52.938
Thank you, Daphne.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.440
You know
I'm afraid my bike

12:54.440 --> 12:55.941
may be too
damaged to ride.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.844
Oh, so we'll borrow one from someone in the building.

12:58.844 --> 13:00.246
I promise you,

13:00.246 --> 13:02.748
you two are going to
learn how to ride bikes.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.583
MARTIN:
You're a good wife,
Daphne.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.452
And I'll bet you
 were a good daughter

13:06.452 --> 13:07.953
when your mother
was alive.

13:20.833 --> 13:21.834
Helmet

13:21.834 --> 13:23.335
Check.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.303
Pads.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.304
Check.

13:26.839 --> 13:27.807
Cup.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.141
Check.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.444
All right, now, remember,
keep your eyes open

13:32.444 --> 13:34.713
and pedal quickly.

13:34.914 --> 13:35.981
I just want to get an idea

13:35.981 --> 13:37.483
of your individual skill levels.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.785
DAPHNE:
All right,
everyone ready,

13:40.085 --> 13:41.987
and... go!

13:43.823 --> 13:45.991
Okay... good start.

13:46.392 --> 13:46.959
Now, let's try again.

13:47.459 --> 13:48.794
But this time further apart.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.134
Okay.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.436
I-I think... this is going
to be all right.

13:57.770 --> 13:58.838
Yeah, yeah, this isn't so bad.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.605
DAPHNE: All right,

13:59.805 --> 14:01.874
and... go.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.847
Yes, very... yes!

14:08.380 --> 14:09.882
(Niles screams)

14:09.882 --> 14:12.885
(bikes clattering)

14:12.885 --> 14:14.353
FRASIER:
Ow!

14:16.188 --> 14:22.795
(classical music playing)

14:52.157 --> 14:56.061
â™ªâ™ª â™ªâ™ª

15:16.215 --> 15:18.284
It's that
damn sycamore.

15:18.717 --> 15:21.120
It's got a magnetic
hold on me.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.922
That's because
you're focusing on it.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.390
Whatever you do,
put it out of your mind.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.863
You're a cloud
scudding across
a clear blue

15:31.163 --> 15:32.731
I'm a cloud.
You're a cloud.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.233
I'm a cloud.
You're a cloud.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.469
I'm a cloud... I'm a cloud

15:38.771 --> 15:43.275
I am a cloud!
I'm flying!

15:43.275 --> 15:44.777
Look, I'm riding a bike!

15:46.278 --> 15:47.279
(bell rings)

15:57.656 --> 15:59.658
(doorbell rings)

16:00.659 --> 16:02.127
(doorbell rings)

16:02.127 --> 16:03.629
I heard you. I'm coming.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.632
Hello.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.635
(loud knocking)

16:09.635 --> 16:11.637
Oh, geez.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.009
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm still ticked.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.845
I'm not proud of it, but I have to do the right thing,

16:19.845 --> 16:21.347
and that means hold this grudge.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.315
Ha! You're talking to me

16:23.315 --> 16:24.583
I knew you would.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.456
Oh, you're here to see Marty?

16:30.456 --> 16:31.957
Actually, I think not.

16:31.957 --> 16:35.260
No, no, this isn't what it looks like

16:35.494 --> 16:37.997
I'm here to apologize.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.999
But since he's not
talking to me,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.500
I guess
I can say my piece to you.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.003
Now, first of all, don't be scared.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.005
I'm not a secret agent

16:46.005 --> 16:48.340
and I don't have
a license to kill.

16:49.975 --> 16:52.011
Back when I said
all that to you,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.546
I wasn't really in
my right mind, anyway.

16:54.546 --> 16:57.516
I mean, I'd just separated from my husband,

16:57.516 --> 16:59.018
and well, maybe I hoped Marty

16:59.518 --> 17:03.022
would be some kind
of knight in shining armor.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.858
But we were never
a couple, though.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.727
It was a pretty rotten
thing you did.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.194
Yes, I know, dear.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.230
Just awful.

17:11.230 --> 17:15.034
In my defense,
I've done much worse.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.872
And besides, between you and
the girl at the bookstore,

17:19.872 --> 17:24.209
I liked you better

17:24.209 --> 17:25.577
(doorbell ringing)

17:25.577 --> 17:27.546
Son of a bitch.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.852
Cora.

17:33.852 --> 17:35.621
Hi. Come on in

17:35.621 --> 17:36.555
Hi.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.624
I ran into a friend
of yours.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.059
She's no friend of mine.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.128
Well, she had
some nice things
to say about you.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.130
Maybe we could talk
about it

17:45.130 --> 17:47.666
at dinner tomorrow.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.436
I don't see him here.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.271
I guess not.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.139
Pick you up at 7:00?

17:54.139 --> 17:56.041
7:00 it is.

17:56.041 --> 17:59.978
So, uh, who's this girl
from the bookstore?

17:59.978 --> 18:01.413
See you tomorrow.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.991
Never thought
I'd see the day.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.493
This is really something.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.994
That's right.

18:15.994 --> 18:16.995
You've faced
your fears

18:17.496 --> 18:18.497
and you've
bested them.

18:18.497 --> 18:19.398
Yeah, thanks
to you.

18:19.698 --> 18:21.767
And who knows, maybe this
is just the beginning.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.769
There are still
mountains to conquer.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.270
The diving board,
for instance.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.772
Or cartwheels.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.273
Be careful out there, son.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.274
I will, Dad.
Thanks.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.776
Guess I better
 go take my place, huh?

18:30.776 --> 18:31.610
Okay.
All right.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.915
Kenny, Julia.

18:36.915 --> 18:37.916
Hey, Doc.
Hi.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.384
Have a good ride.

18:39.384 --> 18:40.686
Not gonna happen.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.455
These shorts are already
bunching me something fierce.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.957
Excuse me.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.627
Pretty exciting.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.028
Thrilling.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.864
You don't mind if we don't ride together, do you?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.365
I like to go
at my own pace

18:53.866 --> 18:55.367
No, not at all.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.735
You don't have to feel like
you have to keep up.

18:57.035 --> 18:59.104
(chuckles)

18:59.104 --> 19:01.440
Right. Well, what do you
say we make it interesting?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.108
What do you
have in mind?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.377
Last one to cross the finish line

19:05.377 --> 19:08.447
doubles the
other's pledges.

19:08.447 --> 19:12.651
And I look forward
to watching you write
that big fat check.

19:12.651 --> 19:13.886
NILES:
Frasier.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.287
Remember, keep
your eye on the road

19:15.787 --> 19:17.656
and don't fixate on anything you
can crash into.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.524
Right.

19:18.524 --> 19:19.925
Good luck.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.360
(starting gun fires)

19:23.328 --> 19:25.297
Boy, I hope I can
steer around

19:25.797 --> 19:27.166
that big mailbox right there.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.134
Ciao.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.814
Frasier?

19:42.814 --> 19:44.316
Are you okay?

19:44.316 --> 19:45.817
I'll be all right.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.319
Why don't you guys
go on ahead.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.587
I'll catch up to you.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.855
Okay.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.696
Oh, Lord.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.697
Pardon me.
Beep, beep.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.698
(nervous laughter)

19:59.698 --> 20:01.700
Oh...
oh, gosh... oh...

20:01.700 --> 20:04.203
Oh, no, no...
Oh, dear God!

20:13.946 --> 20:16.448
â™ªâ™ª Hey, baby,
I hear the blues a-calling â™ª
â™ª

20:16.448 --> 20:18.951
â™ªâ™ª Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs â™ªâ™ª

20:19.451 --> 20:20.452
â™ªâ™ª Quite stylish â™ªâ™ª

20:20.953 --> 20:24.122
â™ªâ™ª And maybe I seem
a bit confused â™ªâ™ª

20:24.122 --> 20:26.391
â™ªâ™ª Yeah, maybe,
but I got you pegged â™ªâ™ª

20:26.391 --> 20:28.527
(laughs)

20:28.527 --> 20:29.962
â™ªâ™ª But I don'â€™â€™t know what to do
 â™ªâ™ª

20:29.962 --> 20:33.465
â™ªâ™ª With those tossed salad
s and scrambled eggs â™ªâ™ª

20:35.467 --> 20:38.470
â™ªâ™ª They'â€™â€™re calling again
. â™ªâ™ª

20:38.470 --> 20:40.973
Scrambled eggs
all over my face.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.474
What is a boy to do?

20:44.476 --> 20:46.478
Good night, everybody!
