00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.971 --> 00:06.872
(theme song playing)

00:08.943 --> 00:12.111
<i> ¶ I got the wind in my hair</i>
<i> and a fire within ¶</i>

00:12.113 --> 00:14.446
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's</i>
<i> something beginning ¶</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:20.019
<i> ¶ I got a mystery to solve</i>
<i> and excitement to spare ¶</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.955
<i> ¶ That beautiful breeze</i>
<i> blowing through ¶</i>

00:22.957 --> 00:27.826
<i> ¶ I'm ready to follow it</i>
<i> who knows where ¶</i>

00:27.828 --> 00:30.796
<i>¶ And I'll get there, I swear ¶</i>

00:30.798 --> 00:36.235
<i> ¶ With the wind in my hair ¶</i>

00:45.880 --> 00:47.246
(muttering) Don't see why
the lady-in-waiting

00:47.248 --> 00:49.648
has to help set up
for this thing.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.220
Dumb science expo's
for dorks, anyway.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.389
Who's ready
for the expo?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.924
(groans)

00:58.926 --> 01:01.093
Hey, Cassie!
Hey, you wanna
see my new invention?

01:01.095 --> 01:03.762
Rumor has it
it is a shoo-in
for the first prize

01:03.764 --> 01:05.064
in the contest.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.999
(whispers) I started the rumor.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.934
Oh. Hey, Varian.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.336
First off, it's Cass,
not Cassie.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.172
Secondly, I'm slammed, so--

01:13.174 --> 01:14.373
Oh, yeah, I-- I hear ya.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.541
Hey, so did I tell you
that my invention

01:15.543 --> 01:18.410
can create an entirely
new element? I call it--

01:18.412 --> 01:20.512
Cassandra, I thought
you should know,

01:20.514 --> 01:23.082
the Captain is short on guards
for the expo.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.650
This could be your big chance!

01:26.387 --> 01:28.087
Come on, let's go!

01:29.924 --> 01:32.858
(hooting)

01:36.797 --> 01:39.398
Cassandra!
Lookin' good!

01:39.400 --> 01:41.467
You should see
some of the inventions
on display!

01:41.469 --> 01:43.268
Look at these crazy goggles!

01:43.270 --> 01:45.804
Oh. Hi, Varian!

01:45.806 --> 01:48.073
I haven't seen you
since we--

01:48.075 --> 01:50.375
Since your last invention
almost killed us.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.410
So glad you're here.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.245
With what looks like
another invention.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.546
Please, I wouldn't miss
a chance

01:54.548 --> 01:56.615
to promote the merits
of alchemy.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.750
And wait until you see
my invention.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.620
I think, uh,
everyone at the expo
will be impressed.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.822
(chuckles) Cassandra's
gonna be here, right?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.724
Not that I'm doing this
for Cassandra!

02:05.726 --> 02:08.494
(chuckles) But, yes, she's
gonna be there, right?

02:11.398 --> 02:14.233
No, no, no!
We'll need men here!

02:14.235 --> 02:17.035
We'll put guards here,
and...

02:18.472 --> 02:20.639
Does this mean
we're out of real guards, too?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.275
-Um...
-Blasted!

02:23.277 --> 02:26.745
This exposition of science
is just spreading our ranks
too thin.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.080
(harrumphs)

02:28.082 --> 02:30.015
We need more guards!

02:30.017 --> 02:32.084
-(clears throat)
-(door closes)

02:33.354 --> 02:34.419
(nickers)

02:34.421 --> 02:36.522
I'll need the room.

02:37.691 --> 02:41.527
So, you want your first
guard assignment.

02:41.529 --> 02:45.264
We've talked about this,
Cassandra. I just don't know
that you're ready.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.599
Dad, I've been training
with the guards
since I was six.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.536
I know castle procedures
and protocol better
than anyone,

02:50.538 --> 02:54.973
so if there's any other reason
why you feel I'm not ready
besides me being your daughter,

02:54.975 --> 02:56.508
I'm all ears.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.480
Very well.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.782
-But...
-There's always a but.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.485
Your lady-in-waiting duties
come first.

03:06.487 --> 03:11.623
Only after you've finished
those, including setting up
for the expo, may you help.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.658
Are we clear?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.026
Crystal.

03:18.132 --> 03:20.299
(groans)

03:20.301 --> 03:22.000
Come on, come on,
come on, come on,
come on!

03:22.002 --> 03:23.569
(gasps) Ooh.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.404
Oh, whoa.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.639
Rapunzel: Wow.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.678
Whoa!

03:32.679 --> 03:34.980
That makes
flipping flapjacks
look like a piece of cake!

03:34.982 --> 03:38.016
(laughs)
Or should I say pancake?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.418
I wouldn't.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.688
Ladies and gentlemen,
forget everything you know

03:42.690 --> 03:45.190
about spring-loaded stilts!

03:45.192 --> 03:47.593
-Rapunzel: Done!
-Uh... Great?

03:47.595 --> 03:48.560
(goat bleats)

03:52.933 --> 03:57.369
Mmm! Fresh from this goat's body
and into my tummy.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.504
(gags, groans)

03:59.506 --> 04:01.273
(groans, gags)

04:02.209 --> 04:03.609
(gas hissing)

04:03.611 --> 04:05.577
Woman:
Attention, science lovers!

04:05.579 --> 04:08.447
I am the one and only
Fernanda Pizazzo!

04:08.449 --> 04:10.215
-(applause)
-Yes. Thank you, thank you.

04:10.217 --> 04:13.619
You may ask yourselves
what revolutionabilly,

04:13.621 --> 04:17.022
stupendimonious invention
lies behind this veil?

04:17.024 --> 04:20.292
You're about to find out
when revered master scientist,

04:20.294 --> 04:23.595
and handsome morsel,
Dr. Alcott St. Croix

04:23.597 --> 04:28.400
arrives to name my entry
into this contest first prize!

04:28.402 --> 04:31.036
-(audience exclaims)
-(gasps) This is
all so inspiring!

04:31.038 --> 04:34.039
I'm gonna go invent
something right now!
(squeals)

04:34.041 --> 04:35.474
Should've seen that comin'!

04:41.482 --> 04:43.415
Varian:
There you are,
Cass-not-Cassie.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.585
We, uh, we didn't
finish our conversation
from earlier. (chuckles)

04:46.587 --> 04:50.656
-I did.
-(chuckles) Oh, you!

04:50.658 --> 04:52.557
Seriously, I'm getting ready
for the expo, and I think

04:52.559 --> 04:54.726
you'll be pretty impressed
with my invention, yeah.

04:54.728 --> 04:58.130
The only thing is,
when I present it
to Master Dr. St. Croix,

04:58.132 --> 05:00.766
it's gonna take two people
to operate it.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.435
Hey! Wanna be the assistant
for my demonstration?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.737
Assistant? What?
Assis-- N-- No.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.408
Look. (gasps) No!
I can't catch a break today.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.149
Varian, thanks for stopping by,
but I wha--?

05:17.151 --> 05:20.018
The stain. It's gone!
But how?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.654
Oh, simple.
Grapes are acidic,
by combining the alkalinity

05:22.656 --> 05:24.356
from the flowers' barley grass
with rock salt,

05:24.358 --> 05:26.825
I was able to stop
the stain's adhesion. Alchemy!

05:26.827 --> 05:30.796
So, you've got a knack
for this kind of thing!

05:30.798 --> 05:34.299
-Any chance you'd want to...
-Help you? Yes!

05:34.301 --> 05:35.801
I-- I mean,
I'd-- I'd love to.

05:35.803 --> 05:39.271
Hey! If-- If I help you,
you can help me
and be my assistant!

05:39.273 --> 05:42.374
-It'll only take a minute!
-Um... deal.

05:42.376 --> 05:46.178
Great! We-- We can be,
uh, co-ladies-in-waiting.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.679
Aha!

05:47.681 --> 05:49.614
Let's not put
a label on it.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.520
(clattering)

06:20.547 --> 06:22.214
Aah! Ah! Yah!

06:33.327 --> 06:34.693
Okay, so for my first invention,

06:34.695 --> 06:37.562
I wanted to start off
with something small and simple.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.598
Uh, can he take his tiny
little claws off my eyes now?

06:39.600 --> 06:43.101
-Rapunzel:
Oh! Yeah! Pascal?
-(squeaking)

06:43.103 --> 06:46.004
I give you the Hey-Hey!

06:46.006 --> 06:49.608
When I was in the tower,
I devised a way to play catch
by myself

06:49.610 --> 06:51.510
using a ball and string.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.413
Now, I believe,
I've perfected that design.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.914
How does it work?
Glad you asked.

06:55.916 --> 06:59.451
It's powered by potential
and kinetic energy.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.786
Science.

07:00.788 --> 07:01.620
Hey-Hey!

07:04.691 --> 07:06.458
Hey-Hey!

07:06.459 --> 07:08.226
Huh. Rapunzel, that's
really amazing, but it's
already been invented.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.795
Hmm. Okay.

07:09.797 --> 07:13.565
I guess I'll chalk that up
to being locked in a tower
for 18 years.

07:13.567 --> 07:17.636
Good thing I have
lots more amazing ideas
where that came from.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.073
Cassandra:
Huh, look at that.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.544
You make a pretty good
co-lady-in-waiting after all.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.780
Oh, really?
You sure you wanna
put a label on it?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.616
Okay, so I could've
been a little nicer earlier.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.786
It's just, today's kind
of a big deal for me.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.658
Oh, you're talking
about getting that
guard assignment

07:39.660 --> 07:41.259
from your dad.
Aren't you?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.662
No matter how much
I want it or how hard I work,

07:43.664 --> 07:46.631
his standards for me are
higher than they are
for anyone else.

07:46.633 --> 07:51.436
Yeah. My dad's...
kind of hard to impress too.

07:51.438 --> 07:53.839
Dads. Am I right? Huh!

07:55.008 --> 07:57.175
(bell chimes)

07:57.177 --> 08:00.111
(growls) Who am I kidding?
None of it matters anyway.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.848
It's already noon
and I still have to make up
all the guest rooms.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.251
Hey! I-- I have an idea.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.821
I'll finish your chores
for you, so then you can
do your guard duty,

08:09.823 --> 08:13.658
and then maybe you
can take a few minutes
to be my assistant?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.627
You sure you can
get all this done?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.028
Yeah. No problem.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.297
It's the kind of thing
friends do, right?

08:19.299 --> 08:22.167
Right! Friends.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.137
(Pascal exclaims)

08:26.139 --> 08:29.641
Rapunzel:
Carrots, celery, cucumbers.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.776
What do these
have in common?

08:31.778 --> 08:32.711
Uh, I don't eat them.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.880
No, wait.
Don't tell me. (grunts)

08:36.016 --> 08:37.482
(chitters)

08:37.484 --> 08:40.852
We chop them!
But knives can be
really dangerous!

08:40.854 --> 08:44.189
That's why I invented
the Safety Slicer!

08:46.293 --> 08:48.593
Just load it up, and...

08:49.663 --> 08:52.731
Slice! Voila!

08:52.733 --> 08:55.901
Ooh! That seems
a little extreme, right?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.302
I mean, for produce?

08:57.304 --> 09:00.238
Besides, I think
they have something
like that already.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.240
Really? This too?

09:02.242 --> 09:05.844
Oh! How am I supposed to know
everything that's ever
been invented?

09:05.846 --> 09:09.314
I don't know,
maybe something
a little more practical?

09:09.316 --> 09:12.717
Practical. Okay. Sure.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.854
Rapunzel:
Automatic laundry cart?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.290
Now that
I have not seen.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.727
-(shrieks)
-(chitters)

09:22.729 --> 09:26.264
(Varian grunting)

09:26.266 --> 09:28.533
-Uh, Varian? Ugh!
-Hey, Princess.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.569
What are you doing?

09:30.571 --> 09:33.238
I'm helping Cass with her work
so she can pull guard duty.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.907
But shouldn't you
be setting up your exhibit?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.842
Oh, theoretically,
but I am presenting
second to last,

09:37.844 --> 09:40.078
so I figure that'll give me
a few extra minutes
to get ready.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.414
(laughs) Plus, I just have
that one room left right there.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.750
Oh, and that room.
Oh, that-- that one, too.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.185
Also-- Also that one.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.889
Look, Varian, I know you
really like Cass, but I think--

09:50.891 --> 09:54.292
Don't worry. Cass agreed
to be my assistant
during my presentation,

09:54.294 --> 09:56.962
so, ya know, I got
everything under control.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.898
-On to the next room!
-Oh, Varian, that is
not a room, that's a...

09:59.900 --> 10:02.500
-Oh, that's
a... (yelling)
-(thudding)

10:04.237 --> 10:06.404
...staircase.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.174
(crowd cheering, applauding)

10:16.149 --> 10:18.783
Master Dr. St. Croix,
welcome!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.952
It is a pleasure
to have you with us!

10:20.954 --> 10:23.888
I imagine it would be.

10:23.890 --> 10:28.593
I assume you are
to be my personal
security detail.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.796
Um, unfortunately, no,
but I have chosen

10:31.798 --> 10:33.999
my very best man
for the job.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.367
Mm-hmm.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.670
(grunts, sighs)

10:38.672 --> 10:40.105
Cassandra:
Wiped out?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.773
Who? Me?
No. Just fainted.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.942
Uh, I mean, fin--
I finished. Finished.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.911
Finished? Wow.
Varian, I'm impressed.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.913
Oh, it was no big deal.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.017
Now, um, if you'll
excuse me, I have
a contest to win.

10:52.019 --> 10:55.654
-Assistant?
-Remember, you said it would
only take a minute, I'm on duty.

10:55.656 --> 10:59.024
-(shattering)
-Ow! My back!

10:59.026 --> 11:02.260
I went to get Master St. Croix
a drink and slipped
on the floor!

11:02.262 --> 11:06.498
What kind of monster
would leave a wet floor
where people could slip on it?

11:07.467 --> 11:08.933
Uh, Stan,
what happened?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.835
-(bones crack)
-Oh! My back!

11:10.837 --> 11:12.537
We need someone
to replace him

11:12.539 --> 11:14.339
as Master St. Croix's
security detail.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.774
Pete! On the double!

11:15.776 --> 11:19.644
On my way! Whoa!
(thuds) Ow! My back!

11:19.646 --> 11:21.880
Why is the floor
so slippery?

11:21.882 --> 11:25.383
Guard:
Hey, Pete, are you okay--
Whoa! (thuds) My back!

11:25.385 --> 11:28.153
(sighs) Cassandra,
are you up for this?

11:28.155 --> 11:30.221
Uh, Cassandra,
don't you have

11:30.223 --> 11:32.557
somewhere to be
during the judging?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.229
I'll do it.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.366
One of you will walk away

11:41.368 --> 11:44.035
with the greatest prize
in all of sciences:

11:44.037 --> 11:46.971
my approval.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.240
As for the rest of you,

11:49.242 --> 11:52.477
may the universe show mercy...

11:52.479 --> 11:55.814
-(crowd gasps)
-...on your wretched souls.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.384
-Good luck.
-(crowd murmuring)

11:59.386 --> 12:01.986
(scattered applause)

12:01.988 --> 12:05.757
You ready?
Because a certain alchemist
could use his assistant.

12:05.759 --> 12:09.694
Listen, Varian, I'm really
sorry, but things have changed.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.196
I can't help you anymore.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.231
-I'm St. Croix's
personal--
-Hello?

12:13.233 --> 12:18.002
Security detail?
I have moved my person
in this direction.

12:18.004 --> 12:18.903
(grunts)

12:20.507 --> 12:24.509
A personal security detail.
Must be a big deal.

12:24.511 --> 12:29.047
Don't worry about me.
I am sure I can find
another assistant

12:29.049 --> 12:32.016
in the next five minutes.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.487
(sighs)

12:39.092 --> 12:41.926
Let the judgment begin!

12:41.928 --> 12:44.129
(cheers, applause)

12:44.131 --> 12:45.730
(goat bleats)

12:45.732 --> 12:48.466
Can it milk a cow?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.068
-No, sir!
-Next!

12:50.070 --> 12:51.169
(goat bleats)

12:52.773 --> 12:55.039
Okay, Pascal,
we've had some missteps, sure,

12:55.041 --> 12:58.576
but I think this one
is the winner.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.279
You've got it
in the bag, Blondie.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.480
Showtime!

13:04.217 --> 13:05.683
Next!

13:08.588 --> 13:09.754
(cheers and applause)

13:09.756 --> 13:11.256
Dangerously wet hallways.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.158
Cold, wet clothes.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.128
Wet hair that takes forever,
and I mean, forever, to dry.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.098
All of those things
are yesterday's problems.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.368
Say hello to the Mega Dry!

13:25.305 --> 13:26.971
Assistant?

13:28.074 --> 13:30.275
I'm all about the wet look.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.178
The Mega Dry uses
cutting-edge equine technology

13:33.180 --> 13:36.147
to release a powerful,
focused stream of air.

13:36.149 --> 13:40.118
The result?
What used to take hours to dry,
now takes seconds.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.686
-(audience exclaims)
-Well, hello.

13:41.688 --> 13:44.122
-(laughter)
-Aah!

13:44.124 --> 13:46.090
-(stammers)
-Oops.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.760
I think I still had it
calibrated for my hair.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.595
(laughing)

13:50.597 --> 13:51.863
(clears throat)

13:51.865 --> 13:52.997
Next.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.270
(sighs)

14:00.473 --> 14:03.508
Behold! The power of alchemy!

14:03.510 --> 14:05.176
(audience laughs)

14:05.178 --> 14:06.945
Shorty:
Hey, where's the opening?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.947
Aha! Oh-ho!

14:08.949 --> 14:11.115
The power of ag, uh...

14:11.117 --> 14:13.318
of, uh, that guy!

14:13.320 --> 14:15.553
(quietly)
Go. Do the thing.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.655
(clears throat)

14:17.657 --> 14:18.790
Oh, yeah!

14:18.792 --> 14:23.061
I give you,
the Elemental Remogrifier!

14:23.063 --> 14:25.163
(gasping)

14:25.165 --> 14:27.365
(cheers and applause)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.633
Assistant?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.371
Here we go.

14:36.142 --> 14:39.177
The rotation causes friction,
which heats the sand,

14:39.179 --> 14:42.647
while the counter-centrifigual
force promotes particle
compression.

14:42.649 --> 14:48.186
The end result?
Fifty pounds of sand
turns into...

14:48.188 --> 14:51.089
-this.
-(crowd exclaims)

14:51.091 --> 14:53.057
-I call this new element...
-(Shorty snoring)

14:53.059 --> 14:54.592
...Cassandrium.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.762
-(gasps)
-(cheers and applause)

14:57.764 --> 15:00.331
(snores, gasps)

15:00.333 --> 15:01.466
(goat bleats)

15:03.169 --> 15:05.103
(crowd gasps)

15:06.539 --> 15:10.675
Despite its lack of flair
and panache,

15:10.677 --> 15:16.247
I was almost inclined
to give your device
a mediocre assessment.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.182
Flair? What does
that have to do with--

15:18.184 --> 15:19.918
However,

15:19.920 --> 15:26.090
considering your assistant
nearly lanced my nasal cavity,

15:26.092 --> 15:30.194
I've no choice
but to disqualify you. Next!

15:30.196 --> 15:32.130
(crowd groans)

15:33.700 --> 15:38.036
Sir, with all due respect,
you can't disqualify him
because of his assistant.

15:38.038 --> 15:42.974
You stick to guarding,
I will stick to sciencing.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.076
Got it? Hmm?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.111
(gas hissing)

15:48.715 --> 15:52.450
Everybody at this expo
make some noise!

15:52.452 --> 15:56.254
This is the momensational moment
you've all been waiting for.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.588
But first!

15:57.590 --> 15:59.290
(booming)

15:59.292 --> 16:01.726
I give you... chocolate!

16:01.728 --> 16:06.264
-(crowd cheering)
-Now this is science!

16:06.266 --> 16:10.101
Jaws, prepare to drop.
Larynxes, get ready to scream,

16:10.103 --> 16:13.071
and eyeballs, how about
you take a good look around,

16:13.073 --> 16:16.441
because once I unveil
my marveltacular creation,

16:16.443 --> 16:19.978
the world will never
look the same!

16:19.980 --> 16:23.281
I give you... the Fantasphere!

16:23.283 --> 16:24.482
(crowd gasps)

16:24.484 --> 16:27.018
(gasps)
How'd she do it?

16:27.020 --> 16:28.453
Oh my gosh!

16:28.455 --> 16:29.854
It's awesome!

16:29.856 --> 16:31.255
(gasping)

16:31.257 --> 16:33.091
(cheers, applause)

16:33.093 --> 16:34.859
But what does it do?

16:34.861 --> 16:38.997
Uh-- The real question, kid,
is, what doesn't it do?

16:38.999 --> 16:40.798
Now, here, have some chocolate
and shut up.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.167
Dr. St. Croix:
Its luster is glorious!

16:43.169 --> 16:47.905
-(gasps)
-I see no need
to continue this contest!

16:49.109 --> 16:50.274
(gasps)

16:50.276 --> 16:53.678
-(cheers)
-(cheers applause)

17:01.287 --> 17:03.888
-You should've won.
-It doesn't matter.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.391
The truth is, all I really
wanted to do was impress you.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.726
I thought if I showed you
what I was capable of,

17:08.728 --> 17:10.895
you might see something in me.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.364
Something special.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.732
I was just being dumb.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.234
But you did impress me.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.069
Varian, you're a great kid.

17:18.071 --> 17:21.372
You're smart.
You're compassionate.
You're unique.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.241
Thanks, for saying that.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.244
Oh, it looks like
St. Croix liked your
invention after all.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.315
Master St. Croix! No!

17:31.317 --> 17:33.151
No! Don't!

17:33.153 --> 17:35.520
You're-- You're building
too much pressure!

17:35.522 --> 17:39.257
Back off, boy!
I'm a scientist.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.726
-Don't!
-(grunts)

17:46.366 --> 17:48.433
Somebody do something!

17:50.070 --> 17:51.769
Double disqualified!

17:53.873 --> 17:55.239
You chose me!

17:55.241 --> 17:57.175
Don't flatter yourself, kid.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.609
Now come on,
we've got a job to do!

17:59.879 --> 18:02.547
-Oh, this is bad.
-How bad?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.615
Introducing
counter-centrifugation
to the magnetism

18:04.617 --> 18:07.251
could result in...
well, that!

18:07.253 --> 18:10.955
Its angular momentum
is rapidly approaching
critical velocity.

18:10.957 --> 18:14.392
Once that happens,
it'll suck up everything
in sight. Us! The castle!

18:14.394 --> 18:15.860
Everything!

18:17.363 --> 18:19.130
(screaming)

18:19.132 --> 18:21.232
(zapping)

18:21.234 --> 18:22.266
-(explosion)
-Ooh!

18:22.268 --> 18:24.435
-Aah!
-You're welcome.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.271
Okay, so, very bad.
How do we stop it?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.307
There's only
one way to stop it.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.276
I gotta get close enough
to pull the hand brake!

18:32.278 --> 18:34.912
Where do you think
you're going?

18:34.914 --> 18:37.315
You're gonna need an assistant!

18:37.317 --> 18:39.283
(chuckles)

18:39.285 --> 18:42.487
Whoa! Cassandra! Help!

18:42.489 --> 18:44.088
(grunting)

18:44.090 --> 18:45.323
(zapping)

18:47.560 --> 18:49.293
(grunting)

18:49.295 --> 18:52.463
I can't get close enough!
The vortex has gotten
too strong.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.433
We need an equally powerful
wind source to counteract it!

18:55.435 --> 18:56.734
The Mega Dry!

18:56.736 --> 18:59.170
The Mega Dry can generate
that kind of wind speed

18:59.172 --> 19:00.571
and blow against
the vortex!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.173
Yes!

19:04.277 --> 19:06.677
He needs to create
a counterpole

19:06.679 --> 19:10.081
to the vortex's
critical velocity!

19:10.083 --> 19:12.517
Max, he means
you have to run backwards!

19:12.519 --> 19:13.818
(nickers)

19:18.358 --> 19:21.526
(grunts) It's working!

19:21.528 --> 19:23.494
Hold on, Cass!

19:23.496 --> 19:24.829
(grunts)

19:26.799 --> 19:28.166
Rapunzel:
Woo-hoo!

19:28.168 --> 19:29.834
(panting)

19:29.836 --> 19:32.470
-Yeah!
-We did it!

19:32.472 --> 19:36.207
Blondie, hands down,
your best invention yet!

19:36.209 --> 19:37.808
(kisses)

19:37.810 --> 19:40.912
Shorty (muffled):
Pardon me, I believe
I've been folded in half.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.916
(St. Croix groans)

19:46.452 --> 19:51.122
You! (whimpers)
Neck... hurts. Ooh!

19:51.124 --> 19:53.457
Master St. Croix,
this still counts
as a win, right?

19:53.459 --> 19:54.892
No take back-sies?

20:02.502 --> 20:05.203
I believe
this was meant for you.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.774
And, um,
this was meant for you.

20:11.477 --> 20:14.478
Thanks. And, Varian,
about putting my own ambition

20:14.480 --> 20:17.048
in front of our friendship,
I'm sorry.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.183
It's-- It's okay,
Cassandra.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.319
Hey, call me Cassie.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.090
Well, I guess I should
start cleaning this mess up.

20:27.994 --> 20:32.563
Cassandra, you helped prevent
what could've been a disaster
for all of us.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.898
Well done.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.367
And I have another
assignment for you.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.535
You know what, Dad?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.704
I'm gonna set
this aside for now.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.305
I think my friend
needs my help.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.610
Well, as Captain of the Guard,
turning down an assignment

20:45.612 --> 20:47.511
doesn't bode well.

20:47.513 --> 20:50.514
But as your dad,
I'm proud of you.

20:55.221 --> 20:58.055
Wow, you turned
your dad down for me?

20:58.057 --> 20:59.857
I'll find a way
to make it up to him.

20:59.859 --> 21:03.861
Besides, it's not every day
you get an element
named after you.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.931
I actually got the idea
after discovering a cluster

21:06.933 --> 21:09.600
of these strange,
black rocks by my village.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.935
Both:
Black rocks?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.538
Varian:
It was amazing.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.441
They just kind of sprouted up
a couple weeks ago.

21:17.443 --> 21:21.045
I have never seen
anything like it.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.614
(chitters, squeaks)

21:28.988 --> 21:30.288
Fascinating.

21:30.290 --> 21:34.058
The rocks are demonstrating
an actual physical response.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.727
To you.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.664
Shh! Varian.

21:39.666 --> 21:43.801
I need you to promise to keep
this between you and me, okay?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.670
And them.

21:45.672 --> 21:49.473
-Wh-- Why?
-Because my dad
has forbidden me

21:49.475 --> 21:52.176
from talking about these rocks
to anyone.

21:52.178 --> 21:54.979
We collectively
are going to figure it out.

21:54.981 --> 21:58.182
But I need to know
that I can trust you.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.151
You can count on me.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.427
(theme music playing)

22:10.797 --> 22:13.631
<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes</i>
<i> opening wide ¶</i>

22:13.633 --> 22:16.167
<i> ¶ My heart burnin' like fire ¶</i>

22:16.169 --> 22:18.536
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.538 --> 22:20.271
<i> ¶ I'm never goin' back ¶</i>

22:20.273 --> 22:22.940
<i> ¶ Whatever I want now</i>
<i> I'm gonna chase ¶</i>

22:22.942 --> 22:25.609
<i> ¶ Who I am</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.611 --> 22:28.979
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:28.981 --> 22:32.616
<i> ¶ 'Cause there's more of me</i>
<i> to give ¶</i>

22:32.618 --> 22:35.686
<i> ¶ Oh yeah</i>
<i>There's more of me to give ¶</i>
