Original Air Date on April 14, 2013

00:53.304 --> 00:57.804
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

00:57.964 --> 00:59.456
What do women want?

00:59.481 --> 01:00.923
Throughout their herstory...

01:00.948 --> 01:02.496
That's right, I said herstory.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.763
Of plant Earth, men have
attempted to answer that

01:05.788 --> 01:07.632
question, and failed.

01:07.753 --> 01:09.928
Or should I say, "maled".

01:10.066 --> 01:11.352
Ha, ha, ha...

01:11.377 --> 01:13.217
Keep it under your
head guys.

01:13.242 --> 01:16.422
That I've got a date
with a married woman.

01:16.447 --> 01:18.184
So let me guess.
Is it Marge?

01:18.943 --> 01:21.017
Her husband's
gonna be there too.

01:21.042 --> 01:22.457
Got it.
You and Marge.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.166
Give up?
It's Marge.

01:24.487 --> 01:26.888
I'm having a lunch date
with my wife

01:26.889 --> 01:28.907
Good one.
Yeah. You got us man.

01:28.932 --> 01:31.103
Ha, ha.
A date with my wife.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.034
Yeah, well I got plans
for lunch too.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.634
I'm lying under a tree.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.735
Hmm. Everybody's got something.

01:37.977 --> 01:41.713
Ooh... this is the coolest
sushi restaurant in town.

01:41.748 --> 01:45.350
It got three and a half stars
in the Springfield Tire Guide.

01:45.385 --> 01:46.718
When we got married,

01:46.753 --> 01:48.954
I promised you a life
full of romance.

01:48.988 --> 01:50.222
Now here it is.

01:50.256 --> 01:51.523
(Marge grumbles)

01:52.492 --> 01:54.626
(Marge and Homer gasp)

01:56.646 --> 01:59.231
Not fresh enough.

01:59.265 --> 02:01.666
Can we get some
soy sauce?

02:01.701 --> 02:05.954
We do not recommend soy sauce
with that particular roll.

02:09.324 --> 02:10.942
No soy sauce!

02:10.977 --> 02:13.111
You and all
your ancestors...

02:13.146 --> 02:14.379
banned!

02:16.115 --> 02:17.249
But-but I... but...

02:17.283 --> 02:20.235
<i>Edamame</i> them away!

02:20.253 --> 02:22.337
You really think that's
going to get rid of us?

02:22.372 --> 02:25.374
How you like this soy sauce?

02:25.408 --> 02:27.876
The customer is
never right!

02:27.910 --> 02:31.313
If they can be that rude,
the food must be great.

02:32.682 --> 02:34.866
I was just leaving a tip.

02:34.901 --> 02:36.601
Tip included!

02:37.987 --> 02:39.471
Oh, Marge,
this is amazing!

02:39.505 --> 02:40.906
I never realized

02:40.940 --> 02:43.542
some restaurants are better
than others.

02:43.576 --> 02:46.211
I hope you are
enjoying your sushi.

02:46.245 --> 02:47.646
It's as yummy

02:47.680 --> 02:50.749
as your poorly produced
local commercial said.

02:50.783 --> 02:53.819
I argued against
that cowboy hat,

02:53.853 --> 02:55.821
but in the end, it worked.

02:56.789 --> 02:58.457
So, without the kids,

02:58.491 --> 03:00.492
we can have sophisticated
grown-up talk.

03:00.526 --> 03:02.594
Oh, yeah. Mmm!

03:02.628 --> 03:05.330
And I'm thinking of getting
Maggie swimming lessons.

03:05.364 --> 03:06.331
Beats drowning.

03:06.365 --> 03:08.900
When God rested on
the seventh day,

03:08.935 --> 03:12.604
did he take a nap or
do a hobby he enjoyed?

03:14.307 --> 03:15.807
<i>I</i> think I'm interesting!

03:15.842 --> 03:17.242
What?! What?!

03:17.276 --> 03:20.078
You're interesting!
Why would you say that?!

03:20.113 --> 03:22.247
Can you chew with
your mouth closed?

03:22.281 --> 03:25.150
It's like looking into
a garbage disposal.

03:25.184 --> 03:28.286
(swallows)
Words hurt, you know?

03:28.321 --> 03:29.688
(sobs)

03:29.722 --> 03:31.823
(slurping)

03:31.858 --> 03:34.092
(blows nose)

03:34.127 --> 03:37.762
The most romantic part
of this was the hold music

03:37.797 --> 03:39.598
when I made
the reservation.

03:39.632 --> 03:41.633
Maybe it's time
for a visit

03:41.667 --> 03:44.469
from Wally
the Kissing Walrus.

03:44.504 --> 03:48.373
(smacking lips loudly)

03:48.407 --> 03:50.642
NARRATOR: <i>Everything has</i>
<i>its breaking point.</i>

03:50.676 --> 03:52.777
<i>Even the strongest substance</i>
<i>in the universe...</i>

03:52.812 --> 03:55.046
<i>a married mother of three.</i>

03:55.081 --> 03:57.949
That usually works,
but not today.

03:57.984 --> 03:59.117
Uh-oh.

03:59.152 --> 04:02.020
Marge, I thought
this was an innocuous lunch,

04:02.054 --> 04:04.289
but it's become terribly ocuous!

04:04.323 --> 04:06.558
Uh, conversation,
conversation...

04:06.592 --> 04:07.826
You look great.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.327
And, uh,
how was your day?

04:09.362 --> 04:10.962
Lousy.

04:10.997 --> 04:12.531
You can't spell
"lousy" without "us."

04:12.565 --> 04:14.332
I'm going to take a cab.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.402
Marge, wait!

04:18.538 --> 04:20.704
Listen, we swore
we'd never go to sleep

04:20.740 --> 04:22.340
angry at each other.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.842
I'm not going to sleep.

04:23.876 --> 04:27.045
Well, you didn't have
two beers with your lunch.

04:27.079 --> 04:29.181
(yawns)

04:31.050 --> 04:32.984
Oh, my God.
A marriage so perfect

04:33.019 --> 04:35.187
that I could take it
for granted for years

04:35.221 --> 04:36.521
suddenly explodes.

04:36.556 --> 04:38.890
What do I do? What do I do?

04:38.925 --> 04:41.226
NARRATOR: <i>For a man confronted</i>
<i>with danger,</i>

04:41.260 --> 04:43.695
<i>two responses</i>
<i>immediately come to mind.</i>

04:43.729 --> 04:46.364
HOMER: <i>I like that picture</i>
<i>of the sneaker with the wings.</i>

04:46.399 --> 04:48.600
<i>I'm gonna flee!</i>

04:48.634 --> 04:52.170
(panting)

04:52.205 --> 04:55.207
Where's an electric sidewalk
when you need one?

04:55.241 --> 04:56.575
Fleeing didn't work.

04:56.609 --> 04:57.943
I have no choice.

04:57.977 --> 04:59.377
I will have to...

04:59.412 --> 05:02.714
do whatever the other thing was!

05:02.748 --> 05:05.050
<i>As Homer prepares</i>
<i>to fight for his marriage,</i>

05:05.084 --> 05:07.686
<i>another battle</i>
<i>between the sexes begins...</i>

05:07.720 --> 05:10.956
<i>on the other side</i>
<i>of Springfield.</i>

05:12.959 --> 05:14.626
(groans)

05:14.660 --> 05:16.962
MILHOUSE: <i>Just once, I wish</i>
<i>Lisa would get up,</i>

05:16.996 --> 05:19.030
<i>come over and sit next to me.</i>

05:19.065 --> 05:22.033
<i>She's getting up!</i>
<i>She's coming over!</i>

05:22.068 --> 05:23.768
<i>This is a nightmare!</i>

05:23.803 --> 05:26.271
I think our lunches
got mixed up.

05:26.305 --> 05:28.473
Oh, I'm sorry.
That means I threw yours out.

05:28.507 --> 05:31.076
But I still have a couple
of your mini carrots.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.244
Mm-hmm.

05:33.279 --> 05:34.913
What's the matter?
Not a vegetarian?

05:34.947 --> 05:37.048
Milhouse, got
anything good?

05:37.083 --> 05:41.920
Sure. I've got goulash,
schnitzel, salmagundi...

05:41.954 --> 05:43.922
Ooh, a cupcake.

05:43.956 --> 05:45.590
Oh, yeah...

05:45.625 --> 05:47.726
Um... do you want it?

05:47.760 --> 05:49.294
Mm-hmm.

05:49.328 --> 05:52.397
<i>I'm gonna give up my cupcake</i>
<i>for a second of attention?</i>

05:52.431 --> 05:55.533
<i>Isn't there a better way</i>
<i>to relate to a girl?</i>

05:59.338 --> 06:01.306
Go wash up and help me
clear the table.

06:02.942 --> 06:05.977
Now, that's how
I clear the table!

06:06.012 --> 06:08.246
He could board my
streetcar any time.

06:08.281 --> 06:09.614
(both laugh)

06:14.120 --> 06:15.487
Why doesn't Blanche go

06:15.521 --> 06:17.255
for that delightful
Karl Malden?

06:17.290 --> 06:19.924
NELSON:
Who, Potato Nose? Forget it.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.761
For some stupid reason,
chicks dig Brando.

06:22.795 --> 06:25.030
Sweaty clothes and mumbling?
(sighs)

06:25.064 --> 06:28.633
I've been wasting my time
with this sophisticated act.

06:35.374 --> 06:38.710
Lisa, you can't have my cupcake.

06:38.744 --> 06:41.012
Wha...?
You heard me, Duchess.

06:41.047 --> 06:43.214
It's mine,
and I'm saving it.

06:43.249 --> 06:45.450
Oh, okay.
If you'll excuse me,

06:45.484 --> 06:48.887
I have to go think of you
in a different light.

06:48.921 --> 06:52.324
Great. She's never gonna talk
to me again.

06:52.358 --> 06:55.477
I'm sorry I was
inconsiderate, Milhouse.

06:55.511 --> 06:58.980
And furthermore, I respect
you more for saying no.

06:59.015 --> 07:00.482
(chuckles)

07:00.516 --> 07:01.883
Tell you what, babe.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.919
Why don't you get me a milk?
(scoffs)

07:04.954 --> 07:07.055
Milhouse, where
are you going with this?

07:07.089 --> 07:09.891
Playing the biggest
hunch of my life.

07:09.925 --> 07:12.093
I just have one
thing to say:

07:12.128 --> 07:13.428
chocolate or regular?

07:13.462 --> 07:14.696
Huh?

07:14.730 --> 07:17.432
Why am I doing this?

07:17.466 --> 07:20.568
(à la Marlon Brando): What are you doing,
going to Wisconsin for the milk?

07:20.603 --> 07:23.738
I've seen cafeteria ketchup
move faster!

07:23.773 --> 07:26.374
(sighs)

07:26.409 --> 07:27.642
(both laugh)

07:29.812 --> 07:32.514
Who knew having a backbone
was attractive?

07:32.548 --> 07:33.848
Certainly not I.

07:33.883 --> 07:35.850
It would change the way
my suits fit.

07:35.885 --> 07:38.453
Milhouse, you'll probably
think this is lame,

07:38.487 --> 07:41.222
but I was gonna go for
a nature walk after school,

07:41.257 --> 07:43.091
and I thought maybe
you'd like to...

07:43.125 --> 07:44.926
Just start nature-walking.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.895
See if I show up.

07:46.929 --> 07:48.697
NARRATOR:
<i>Milhouse has made his choice,</i>

07:48.731 --> 07:51.466
<i>and if there's any justice,</i>
<i>he's doomed.</i>

07:51.500 --> 07:53.968
<i>Now let's see</i>
<i>what Maggie's up to.</i>

07:55.004 --> 07:56.571
<i>Moving on...</i>

07:56.605 --> 08:00.575
Why are all his laundry-basket
shots three point attempts?

08:03.846 --> 08:07.048
What are you doing
home from work?

08:07.083 --> 08:08.450
I'm fighting
for you, babe.

08:08.484 --> 08:09.784
Fighting like I would

08:09.819 --> 08:12.287
for the last slice
of cold pizza in the box.

08:12.321 --> 08:14.723
And to show you
how serious I am...

08:14.757 --> 08:16.791
From the gas station?

08:16.826 --> 08:19.961
From the place <i>beside</i>
the gas station.

08:19.995 --> 08:21.229
Hmm.

08:21.263 --> 08:23.932
Well, that does sound good.

08:23.966 --> 08:27.402
I'll just stick this
in your apology card drawer.

08:27.436 --> 08:29.571
(grunting)

08:30.639 --> 08:31.740
(gasps)

08:33.808 --> 08:36.811
No. I'm tired
of your broken promises.

08:36.846 --> 08:39.114
"Marge, I'm gonna
lose ten pounds."

08:39.148 --> 08:41.448
"Sweetie, I'll be
home at 8:00 p.m."

08:41.484 --> 08:43.451
"Sweetie, I'll be home
at 8:00 a.m."

08:43.486 --> 08:45.120
"I'll take you out

08:45.154 --> 08:48.223
to the most romantic lunch
of your life." I'm done!

08:50.726 --> 08:54.162
Marge was so happy
when I made those promises.

08:54.196 --> 08:55.597
What changed?

09:03.716 --> 09:04.999
(gasps)

09:05.034 --> 09:07.085
Milhouse,
seeing you there

09:07.119 --> 09:08.186
saying nothing...

09:08.220 --> 09:10.021
it's the cutest
you've ever been.

09:10.055 --> 09:11.356
Uh...

09:11.390 --> 09:12.690
Hush, sweet boy.

09:12.725 --> 09:15.159
Let me get lost
in the blue of your eyebrows.

09:15.194 --> 09:16.861
Whatever.

09:16.896 --> 09:19.998
Did you bring me that sandwich
what I sent you out for?

09:20.032 --> 09:22.000
It came with fries
or salad.

09:22.034 --> 09:23.868
Whichever you picked,
you picked wrong.

09:23.903 --> 09:25.837
Well, I wasn't sure,
so I got both.

09:25.871 --> 09:28.439
(chuckles)
Who knows her little Milhouse?

09:28.474 --> 09:30.875
<i>I'm acting like a jerk,</i>
<i>and Lisa's eating it up.</i>

09:30.910 --> 09:32.477
<i>Why don't I feel good?</i>

09:32.511 --> 09:36.548
<i>I need advice from the most</i>
<i>important woman in my life.</i>

09:36.582 --> 09:39.067
So everything was going great,

09:39.101 --> 09:43.404
and then I wondered if the me
she likes is the real me.

09:43.439 --> 09:45.907
Well, let me say
this is the first time

09:45.941 --> 09:47.809
you've been brave enough
to sit in this office

09:47.843 --> 09:49.477
without a bunny in your lap.

09:49.511 --> 09:50.845
Where is the bunny?!

09:50.880 --> 09:53.214
He's in the closet.
He's fine.

09:53.249 --> 09:56.751
I'm over here,
Milhouse. Focus.

09:56.785 --> 09:58.052
You got to help me, Doc.

09:58.087 --> 10:00.655
I just don't know
what to do.

10:00.689 --> 10:02.323
Don't worry,
I'm here for you,

10:02.358 --> 10:05.026
and I'll be here
for as long as it takes.

10:05.060 --> 10:07.328
(phone rings)
I'm fired?

10:07.363 --> 10:08.730
You're on your own.

10:08.764 --> 10:10.999
I'll clean out my
office immediately.

10:11.033 --> 10:14.002
I'll show you
how to clean out an office!

10:15.387 --> 10:19.657
I don't usually say this
to kids, but don't be yourself.

10:19.692 --> 10:21.726
Because yourself is not working.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.595
Be that guy you just were.

10:23.629 --> 10:24.629
Gotcha.

10:31.537 --> 10:34.789
Oh, I love you, Fluffy Fella.

10:34.823 --> 10:37.358
I just got fired!
I need it more than you.

10:37.393 --> 10:38.893
Fluffy Fella!

10:38.928 --> 10:41.429
Fella...!

10:41.463 --> 10:43.765
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, Homer</i>
<i>was doing something</i>

10:43.799 --> 10:46.618
<i>very difficult for him--</i>
<i>thinking.</i>

10:46.652 --> 10:49.087
How do I win Marge over?

10:49.121 --> 10:51.089
I could get her kids to like me.

10:51.123 --> 10:53.024
No, that ship has sailed.

10:53.058 --> 10:55.293
Hmm.

10:55.327 --> 10:58.863
NARRATOR: <i>Fortunately, the modern man</i>
<i>has a third alternative.</i>

10:58.897 --> 11:01.199
Hmm.
Would it make a woman happy

11:01.233 --> 11:04.018
to do the things
she asked you to do?

11:05.304 --> 11:07.171
I think it would.

11:07.206 --> 11:10.108
Searchy, where can I
find brake fluid?

11:10.142 --> 11:13.878
There are 14 Taco Joes
in your area.

11:13.912 --> 11:15.680
That was yesterday.

11:15.714 --> 11:18.816
"Yesterday" by John Lennon
and Paul McCartney.

11:18.851 --> 11:21.452
Where can I find a better
voice-activated search machine?

11:21.487 --> 11:22.820
(groans)

11:22.855 --> 11:25.156
Oh, I can't please any woman.

11:25.190 --> 11:26.858
(groans)

11:28.460 --> 11:29.794
(Bart and Milhouse giggling)

11:29.828 --> 11:31.279
Milhouse, I'm not sure why

11:31.313 --> 11:34.015
you left me in the forest,
so I made cookies.

11:34.049 --> 11:35.350
But I didn't know
what kind you liked,

11:35.384 --> 11:36.985
so I made seven kinds.

11:37.019 --> 11:37.986
(gasps)

11:38.020 --> 11:39.554
I've become my mother.

11:39.588 --> 11:42.757
Well, common sense never
goes out of style. (groans)

11:42.791 --> 11:44.759
(shrieks)
That was too easy.

11:44.793 --> 11:45.893
Lisa!

11:45.928 --> 11:47.695
Did you see Marlon Brando

11:47.730 --> 11:49.564
in "Mutiny on the Bounty"?

11:49.598 --> 11:51.499
No, nobody did.

11:51.533 --> 11:53.534
Then this is just me.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.788
(yells)

11:58.624 --> 11:59.841
Ta-da.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.159
(groans)
(grunts)

12:01.193 --> 12:02.543
Bart! Milhouse!

12:04.413 --> 12:05.446
Hmm.

12:08.150 --> 12:09.150
(chuckling)

12:14.637 --> 12:17.138
Okay, let's see
how straight it is.

12:17.139 --> 12:19.174
(grunts)

12:19.208 --> 12:20.742
Guess who's
coming to dinner.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.428
What have I told you
about comical entrances?

12:23.446 --> 12:24.696
Sorry.

12:24.730 --> 12:27.065
But you never said anything
about comical exits.

12:31.070 --> 12:32.420
Homie, what are you doing?

12:32.455 --> 12:34.189
I'm planing down that door

12:34.223 --> 12:35.624
that always sticks.

12:35.658 --> 12:37.542
I put training wheels
on Bart's bike,

12:37.577 --> 12:40.078
and made an appointment
with the dermatologist

12:40.112 --> 12:42.814
to see about my slowly
receding hairline.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.382
Oh, Homer.

12:44.417 --> 12:45.967
Yes, my love?

12:46.002 --> 12:48.653
This list
is from six years ago.

12:48.688 --> 12:49.955
Oh, well,

12:49.989 --> 12:51.590
you know how,
in the Special Olympics,

12:51.624 --> 12:53.792
they give medals
just for showing up?

12:53.826 --> 12:56.478
How many times do I
have to tell you to quit

12:56.512 --> 12:59.681
comparing our relationship
to the Special Olympics?

12:59.732 --> 13:01.316
NARRATOR:
<i>When all is lost,</i>

13:01.350 --> 13:03.785
<i>a man's mind turns to one thing</i>

13:03.819 --> 13:05.837
<i>and one thing only.</i>

13:05.872 --> 13:08.806
What fish may I deplete
from our oceans

13:08.824 --> 13:10.492
for your passing pleasure?

13:10.526 --> 13:12.794
Perhaps some shark fin soup?

13:12.828 --> 13:14.079
Whale tonsils?

13:14.113 --> 13:15.764
Baby dolphin blowhole?

13:15.798 --> 13:16.965
Turtle smile?

13:16.999 --> 13:18.934
I'd like a lot of food,

13:18.968 --> 13:21.119
and for this to be the last
decision I have to make.

13:21.153 --> 13:23.321
Aye, you want <i>omakase--</i>

13:23.356 --> 13:24.356
chef's choice.

13:24.390 --> 13:26.024
You're all I have left.

13:26.058 --> 13:28.026
I trust you completely.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.361
And I you.

13:29.395 --> 13:30.962
Let me run your credit card

13:30.997 --> 13:32.664
to celebrate that trust.

13:32.698 --> 13:34.532
Okay.

13:34.567 --> 13:35.800
This should do it.

13:35.835 --> 13:38.670
Thank you, Mr. Franders.

13:38.704 --> 13:39.938
(grunts)

13:39.972 --> 13:42.207
Lis, you saved us.

13:42.241 --> 13:44.109
Milhouse, are you okay?

13:44.143 --> 13:46.094
Milhouse, for <i>Superman II,</i>

13:46.128 --> 13:48.597
I got $5 million
for three days work,

13:48.631 --> 13:53.184
so don't expect any more
free advice from me.

13:53.219 --> 13:56.054
How about me,
Potato Nose?

13:57.223 --> 13:59.257
Uh... later.

14:03.329 --> 14:04.996
(sighs)

14:05.031 --> 14:07.198
I see tears in your <i>toro.</i>

14:07.233 --> 14:09.134
Marriage is so tough.

14:09.168 --> 14:12.304
Every second, it could
explode catastrophically.

14:12.338 --> 14:14.205
Makes me not want to
come home from my job

14:14.240 --> 14:15.507
at the nuclear plant.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.876
I say marriage is like fish.

14:17.910 --> 14:19.894
There are parts so delicious

14:19.929 --> 14:22.697
they could've been sliced
from angels...

14:22.732 --> 14:24.866
...and parts we make
into <i>omakase.</i>

14:24.900 --> 14:26.701
<i>Omakase...</i>

14:26.736 --> 14:29.004
Where have I heard
that word before?

14:29.038 --> 14:31.306
You haven't--
now, finish your <i>omakase.</i>

14:31.340 --> 14:33.908
Although we have but one ocean,

14:33.943 --> 14:36.845
it offers many special delights.

14:39.181 --> 14:40.148
(screams)

14:40.182 --> 14:43.018
Wow.

14:43.052 --> 14:46.154
Wow, this is the most delicious
analogy I've ever eaten.

14:46.188 --> 14:48.556
I need to share
this insight with Marge.

14:48.591 --> 14:51.159
Put this
in your finest Styrofoam.

14:51.193 --> 14:53.211
(clamoring)

14:54.246 --> 14:56.581
Once again, by eating alone,

14:56.615 --> 14:58.283
I have saved my marriage.

14:58.317 --> 15:00.885
Please enjoy,
with my compliments.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.922
You can even eat the eyes.

15:03.956 --> 15:06.024
Hmm.

15:06.058 --> 15:08.259
He ate the eye.
(laughs)

15:09.795 --> 15:12.697
HOMER:
Marge?

15:12.732 --> 15:15.050
For reasons I forgot
in the car,

15:15.084 --> 15:17.535
this sushi represents
our marriage.

15:17.570 --> 15:20.905
But what I know for sure is that
I want to share it with you.

15:24.293 --> 15:25.527
MARGE:
<i>He's taken a step.</i>

15:25.561 --> 15:27.562
<i>He's really close.</i>

15:27.596 --> 15:30.899
<i>All he has to do is not eat</i>
<i>a piece before I do.</i>

15:34.937 --> 15:36.604
<i>Okay.</i>

15:36.639 --> 15:39.207
<i>But every man deserves</i>
<i>a second chance.</i>

15:39.241 --> 15:40.675
<i>As long as he doesn't...</i>

15:41.761 --> 15:43.228
I'm not hungry.

15:43.262 --> 15:44.529
Good night.

15:47.750 --> 15:51.886
Well, at least you don't
have to suffer, boy.

15:51.921 --> 15:53.455
(gasps)

15:53.489 --> 15:56.825
Someone fed my
sushi to a dog!

15:56.859 --> 16:00.228
You didn't get so mad when I
told you I was fired today.

16:00.262 --> 16:01.963
Blessing in disguise.

16:01.997 --> 16:04.099
Now you can get your PhD.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.901
I don't want a PhD.
I want a baby.

16:06.936 --> 16:08.803
(groans)
Here we go again.

16:15.368 --> 16:18.253
Lisa, I could be
anyone for you.

16:18.288 --> 16:20.389
Except someone
who's mean to you.

16:20.423 --> 16:24.109
So I'm just gonna cave in
and give you the cupcake.

16:24.143 --> 16:26.228
I don't know...
it's four days old,

16:26.262 --> 16:27.829
I just ate...

16:27.864 --> 16:29.698
Who are you, the Queen of Siam?

16:29.732 --> 16:31.400
Just take the cupcake.

16:31.434 --> 16:33.568
Okay.

16:34.787 --> 16:37.539
I wonder
if Brando liked cupcakes.

16:37.573 --> 16:41.076
I'm down to two a day, but
I've been dead for ten years.

16:41.110 --> 16:42.210
HOMER:
<i>Aw, Moe.</i>

16:42.245 --> 16:43.712
Can you think of a way

16:43.746 --> 16:45.447
to please a woman
that starts with "F"?

16:45.481 --> 16:47.441
Hey, you know, it's funny
you should mention that.

16:47.450 --> 16:49.885
I've been reading that, uh,
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey,</i>

16:49.919 --> 16:52.454
and it turns out that what
chicks want now is a guy

16:52.488 --> 16:54.790
to give them what for
in the bedroom there.

16:54.824 --> 16:57.726
Whoo-hoo! I'll woo
her with whoo-hoo.

17:00.146 --> 17:01.980
Ah, you know,
if this is what women like,

17:02.015 --> 17:03.949
I should be a lot more popular.

17:03.983 --> 17:07.285
But it does inspire me
to work on my fan fiction.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.756
"Sheriff Andy took Barney
in his arms

17:10.790 --> 17:13.290
"and kissed him deeply,
then said,

17:13.326 --> 17:15.160
"'Now, if Aunt Bee asks,

17:15.194 --> 17:16.778
we were down
at the fishin' hole.'"

17:16.813 --> 17:19.564
I-I can't be the only one
who likes this.

17:24.671 --> 17:26.637
Hello, there.

17:28.441 --> 17:29.975
(gasps)

17:30.009 --> 17:31.493
The minister's wife--
what are you doing here?

17:31.527 --> 17:33.562
Um... protesting.

17:33.596 --> 17:35.997
Is this dominating enough
for you, sweetheart?

17:36.032 --> 17:38.700
Go back to the cowboy thing
and wait in the car.

17:38.735 --> 17:39.901
Help me out here, Homer.

17:39.936 --> 17:42.204
(nervous laugh)

17:42.238 --> 17:44.072
Listenpal,

17:44.107 --> 17:45.574
this may sound kind of kinky,

17:45.608 --> 17:48.543
but, uh, I would like to, uh,

17:48.578 --> 17:50.545
please my wife.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.814
Well, are you comfortable
with role play?

17:52.849 --> 17:56.251
(Cockney accent): I think I could give it
a shot what-what, governor.

17:56.285 --> 17:57.419
Bob's your uncle.

17:57.453 --> 17:58.787
Okay, no role play.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.155
(groans)

18:01.424 --> 18:03.725
HOMER (singsongy):
Oh, Marge.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.028
Come to the garage.

18:07.063 --> 18:09.998
You know it'll be good
'cause I'm saying it

18:10.032 --> 18:13.001
in a singsong fashion.

18:13.035 --> 18:15.036
(gasps)

18:15.071 --> 18:17.372
It's a snuggle dungeon.

18:17.407 --> 18:18.974
Hey, Homer,
can I get back my...

18:19.008 --> 18:20.392
(screams)

18:21.427 --> 18:23.161
What does this do?

18:23.196 --> 18:24.479
Now, just relax.

18:24.514 --> 18:25.463
Sit down...

18:25.481 --> 18:26.464
Not in that chair!

18:26.482 --> 18:27.833
It has no bottom!

18:27.867 --> 18:30.068
This is not putting
me in the mood.

18:30.103 --> 18:31.436
Anger's a mood.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.655
Why would you think
I'd like this?

18:33.689 --> 18:34.689
I don't know.

18:34.741 --> 18:36.108
It's just that you always say

18:36.142 --> 18:37.826
we should try new things.

18:37.860 --> 18:42.314
But I thought snuggle clamps
just might rekindle...

18:42.348 --> 18:45.133
(screaming)

18:45.168 --> 18:47.669
Quick, call the
Procter & Gamble help line!

18:47.703 --> 18:48.837
Really?

18:48.871 --> 18:50.539
Geez, they make
everything.

18:50.573 --> 18:52.841
(pained sigh)

18:54.744 --> 18:56.278
Huh?

18:56.312 --> 18:58.480
HOMER:
<i>Oh, my God, Marge is here.</i>

18:58.514 --> 19:00.348
<i>What is she thinking now?</i>

19:00.383 --> 19:02.551
I'm glad you're okay.

19:02.585 --> 19:03.819
Mmm?

19:03.853 --> 19:05.654
Now, I'm going to give you

19:05.688 --> 19:07.689
a powerful muscle relaxant.

19:09.826 --> 19:12.144
Hmm, that was
just a placebo.

19:12.211 --> 19:13.211
What does that mean?

19:13.246 --> 19:14.729
Powerful drug.

19:14.764 --> 19:16.381
(chuckles)

19:16.415 --> 19:18.884
Homer, I'm glad
that you tried,

19:18.918 --> 19:21.920
even though now I can't
find the washing machine.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.338
It's behind the Dingle Swing.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.406
Oh...

19:24.440 --> 19:26.558
So you forgive me?

19:26.592 --> 19:28.360
Not because of
what you bought,

19:28.394 --> 19:31.029
but because I realized
that no matter what,

19:31.063 --> 19:33.598
you will never stop trying,

19:33.633 --> 19:37.035
and there's nothing a woman
loves more than that.

19:37.069 --> 19:39.404
Aw, thanks, honey.

19:39.438 --> 19:42.374
So, uh, you're not cool

19:42.441 --> 19:44.176
with any of the toys?

19:44.210 --> 19:47.012
Actually, I'm cool
with one of them.

19:47.046 --> 19:48.146
Which one?

19:48.181 --> 19:49.414
Not gonna say.

19:49.448 --> 19:50.448
What size batteries?

19:50.483 --> 19:51.416
D.

19:51.450 --> 19:52.584
Ooh, how many?

19:52.618 --> 19:53.685
Sixteen.

19:53.719 --> 19:54.953
Holy moly.

20:01.861 --> 20:04.729
NARRATOR: <i>And so Homer</i>
<i>and Marge's marriage</i>

20:04.747 --> 20:06.965
<i>was saved for another week.</i>

20:06.999 --> 20:09.000
<i>As for Milhouse and Lisa...</i>

20:12.305 --> 20:14.639
Aw, that's sweet.

20:14.674 --> 20:17.843
And those are the only two
