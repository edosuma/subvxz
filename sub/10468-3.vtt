THE EXTRA COOKIE DOUGH?

09:16.904 --> 09:18.079
HMM. I DON'T KNOW.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.168
AND WE DROPPED THE BOWL,

09:20.168 --> 09:21.952
AND IT SMASHED
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

09:21.952 --> 09:26.000
OH, MAN. YEAH. THAT TIME.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.567
OH, DAD, HE--
RIGHT.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.917
HE WENT BALLISTIC.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.832
TOTALLY FREAKED.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.094
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
OF THAT?

09:33.094 --> 09:35.226
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT MOM DID?

09:35.226 --> 09:38.403
SHE MADE US RUN UP
TO HIM AND SAY THAT
WE WERE SORRY

09:38.403 --> 09:40.492
AND TELL HIM WE
LOVED HIM AND HUG HIM.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.669
SHE DID?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.671
YEAH. AND IT WORKED
LIKE A CHARM.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.672
LIKE IT ALWAYS DID.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
KIND OF SMART,
I GUESS, HUH?

09:47.282 --> 09:50.328
Julia: YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.

09:50.328 --> 09:51.895
'CAUSE HIS TEMPER
NEVER CHANGED.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.375
IT NEVER
GOT ANY BETTER.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.944
AND ALL OF THAT TIME,
I NEVER HEARD HER SAY STOP.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.250
JUST STOP BEING
ANGRY.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.905
JULIA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:01.905 --> 10:03.341
NOTHING.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.560
OWEN IS SITTING RIGHT
OVER THERE,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.170
LISTENING TO EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SAYING.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.519
WHAT AM I SAYING?

10:07.519 --> 10:09.826
THAT HIS PARENTS WERE FIGHTING
ALL THE TIME.

10:09.826 --> 10:12.960
THAT MOM--WHAT,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.701
THAT MOM NEVER
BACKED US UP?

10:14.701 --> 10:17.007
NEVER STOOD UP
AGAINST HORRIBLE, ANGRY DAD?

10:17.007 --> 10:18.574
Julia:
BAILEY, COME ON, NO.
I'M JUST--

10:18.574 --> 10:20.141
I'M TAKING A LOOK
AT THE FAMILY,

10:20.141 --> 10:21.446
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
MOM AND DAD--

10:21.446 --> 10:23.274
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.973
WHATEVER YOU'RE TRASHING
THEM FOR--FOR YOUR BOOK
OR WHATEVER--

10:25.973 --> 10:28.236
JUST LEAVE US OUT OF IT.

10:28.236 --> 10:31.892
CLAUDIA DOESN'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, DO YOU?

10:31.892 --> 10:33.241
I MEAN, NOT REALLY.

10:33.241 --> 10:37.854
NO. AND NEITHER DO I, AND
NEITHER DOES OWEN.

10:37.854 --> 10:41.684
Bailey: HEY, BUD,
WE'RE GONNA WORK
UPSTAIRS, OK? COME ON.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.346
SHE WAS A WILD GIRL,
YOUR MOM.

10:51.346 --> 10:55.393
HA HA. I REMEMBER ONCE-- SHE GOT
ARRESTED FOR SKINNY DIPPING

10:55.393 --> 10:58.135
IN A FOUNTAIN
IN CENTRAL PARK.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.050
THE ARRESTING OFFICER
ASKED HER OUT.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.053
THAT'S HOW IT WAS.
I MEAN, SHE HAD GUYS
LINED UP AROUND THE BLOCK.

11:03.053 --> 11:06.317
SO, THERE WERE
A LOT OF MEN.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.580
OH, NO. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SAY THAT SHE WAS...
SHE'S NOT...

11:08.580 --> 11:10.191
NO, NO. THAT'S OK.

11:10.191 --> 11:13.977
REALLY. YOU KNOW, I WANT TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.501
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN, SARAH.

11:16.501 --> 11:19.069
AND A REALLY GOOD ACTRESS.

11:19.069 --> 11:20.680
SHE WAS IRRESISTIBLE.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.204
LEADING MEN,
STAGE MANAGERS...

11:23.204 --> 11:26.424
GOD, I THINK THERE WAS EVEN
AN USHER WHO PROPOSED.

11:26.424 --> 11:30.428
OH, SHE SENT ME A PLAYBILL

11:30.428 --> 11:33.214
FROM HER FIRST REAL SHOW.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.346
AND I THINK IT'S IN HERE.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.741
HERE IT IS.

11:38.741 --> 11:39.742
CYRANO.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.962
SHE PLAYED ROXANNE.

11:41.962 --> 11:44.921
AND OPPOSITE HER, THE GUY...
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

11:44.921 --> 11:47.750
OH, UM...
WILLIAM LANFORD.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.231
RIGHT. SHE SAID
HE WAS WONDERFUL.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.667
AND THAT THEY WERE
WONDERFUL TOGETHER.

11:51.667 --> 11:55.453
WAIT! WAIT, WHAT IS
THIS? SHE--SHE
SIGNED IT.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.630
"MINDY, IT FEELS
LIKE EVERYTHING

11:58.630 --> 12:00.676
IN MY LIFE
IS ABOUT TO CHANGE."

12:02.286 --> 12:03.984
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE MEANS?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.813
I THINK THAT PROGRAM
WAS THE LAST CONTACT
I HAD WITH HER.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.510
WE LOST TOUCH AFTER THAT.

12:08.510 --> 12:11.165
BUT YOU KNEW HER,
SO--SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK SHE MEANT?

12:11.165 --> 12:13.254
UM,WAS SHE TALKING
ABOUT HER CAREER?

12:13.254 --> 12:16.953
IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO, SARAH.

12:16.953 --> 12:19.173
MAYBE SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.354
THANKS FOR TAKING TIME
OUT OF YOUR DAY.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.273
[SIGHS]WELL...

12:32.273 --> 12:33.840
UHH.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.755
THAT WAS SUCH A JOKE.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.060
OH, DAPHNE,
I'M SORRY.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.672
I KNOW. WHAT AM I
GONNA DO NOW?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.674
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL--WE'LL
THINK OF SOMETHING.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.067
WE'LL--WE'LL
DO SOMETHING.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.634
YEAH, WE BETTER, BECAUSE
DR. FRANKLIN WANTS ME

12:45.634 --> 12:47.288
TO START, LIKE, TODAY.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.289
HE DOES?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.507
UH-HUH.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.813
YOU'RE DR. FRANKLIN'S
NEW ASSISTANT?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.162
YEAH.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.642
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO
CARE ABOUT YOUR UTTER LACK

12:53.642 --> 12:55.122
OF PROFESSIONAL
EXPERIENCE?

12:55.122 --> 12:57.080
YEAH, HE DID.
THAT'S WHY I LIED.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.081
YOU LIED?!

12:58.081 --> 12:59.126
WELL, HOW ELSE WAS

12:59.126 --> 13:00.475
I GONNA GET
THE JOB, KIRSTEN?

13:00.475 --> 13:02.042
YOU LIED.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.652
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TEACH ME, LIKE, EVERYTHING.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.349
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING
I KNOW HOW TO DO

13:05.349 --> 13:07.090
IS MAKE LONG-DISTANCE PHONE
CALLS AND STEAL OFFICE SUPPLIES.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.222
YOU LIED.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.093
YEAH, HONEY.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.313
WE COVERED THAT.
[SIGHS]

13:12.313 --> 13:16.273
NOW SHOW ME.
WHAT IS IT THAT
WE ACTUALLY DO HERE?

13:16.273 --> 13:17.927
[WHISTLE BLOWS]

13:20.016 --> 13:21.539
HEY.
HEY.

13:21.539 --> 13:22.802
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

13:24.455 --> 13:27.415
OK, THE THING IS,
I READ THAT WEB PAGE AGAIN.

13:27.415 --> 13:31.375
IT SAYS THAT
RUDY BAYLOR'S A CLOSET NERD
WHO'S SO GOOD AT MATH

13:31.375 --> 13:33.769
HE TESTED OUT OF TRIG.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.815
AND THE ONLY GUY
WHO PLAYS BASKETBALL
WITH RUDY

13:35.815 --> 13:38.208
AND TAKES MR. BAUM'S
TRIG CLASS IS...

13:39.340 --> 13:40.341
WELL, YOU.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.560
SO?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.040
SO YOU KNEW
ALL THAT STUFF

13:44.040 --> 13:45.825
ABOUT LEX
AND RHIANNON AND RUDY.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.000
I DON'T FOLLOW.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.523
NO, NEITHER DO I,
'CAUSE...

13:48.523 --> 13:51.221
I FEEL LIKE THE STORY
THAT SHOULD BE ONLINE

13:51.221 --> 13:53.571
IS WHATEVER THE HECK
THEY DID TO YOU.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.443
'CAUSE IT MUST HAVE
BEEN SOMETHING.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.880
I GOTTA GET GOING.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.143
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT?

14:00.143 --> 14:02.450
YOU'RE TRASHING YOUR FRIENDS
BECAUSE YOU THINK
THAT THEY DO ANYTHING

14:02.450 --> 14:03.930
TO FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THEMSELVES,

14:03.930 --> 14:07.194
BUT, I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
JUST WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

14:14.549 --> 14:17.073
HEY. JULIA, RIGHT?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.032
I--I'M ISABELLE.
HOW'S IT GOING?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.642
UH, LISTEN,
BEFORE YOU SPEAK,

14:20.642 --> 14:22.383
I JUST HAVE TO SAY
I'M SORRY.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.776
I HAVE BEEN
A TOTAL BITCH.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.170
EVER SINCE YOU
TRANSFERRED IN,
ALL I COULD THINK

14:27.170 --> 14:30.913
WAS PLEASE, SHE HAS
THE PUBLISHING
CONTRACT I DESERVE,

14:30.913 --> 14:32.393
JUST LET HER DIE,

14:32.393 --> 14:35.135
BUT HOW UNORIGINAL,
YOU KNOW?

14:35.135 --> 14:38.225
WHEN EVERYONE
IN CLASS ALREADY
HATES YOU?

14:38.225 --> 14:43.708
OH, SO JUST...YOU
LOOK REALLY SAD,

14:43.708 --> 14:45.319
AND IF TALKING
MIGHT HELP...

14:47.147 --> 14:51.629
OHH. ALL RIGHT,
WELL, UM...

14:51.629 --> 14:53.980
MY EDITOR KEEPS TELLING ME
I'M NOT BEING HONEST

14:53.980 --> 14:57.070
IF I DON'T BLAME
MY PARENTS IN SOME WAY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.898
MY SIBLINGS, THEY HEAR THIS,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.290
AND THEY'RE LIKE
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?

15:00.290 --> 15:02.423
AND THE TRUTH IS
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.946
BUT HOW ELSE
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHO YOU ARE

15:03.946 --> 15:05.992
WITHOUT AT LEAST LOOKING
AT YOUR PARENTS FIRST?

15:05.992 --> 15:09.473
YEAH. PLEASE.
YOU THINK I CAME OUT
OF THE WOMB THIS WAY?

15:09.473 --> 15:13.086
UM...I'M GONNA NEED
SOME COFFEE.

15:15.131 --> 15:17.568
OK.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.745
HEY. I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.360
HERE.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.756
THAT IS YOUR NEW
FURNITURE PROJECT.

15:31.756 --> 15:32.932
A GUILLOTINE?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
YEAH. HA HA HA.

15:34.411 --> 15:36.326
SOMETHING ABOUT IT
JUST SCREAMED OUT MYRA.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.633
LOOK, MR. SALINGER,
LET'S BE HONEST.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.765
YOU DON'T KNOW ME ENOUGH
TO ACTUALLY CARE,

15:40.765 --> 15:43.943
AND I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
TO BE SOME TEACHER'S
GOOD DEED FOR THE DAY.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.339
SO WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM, MYRA?

15:49.339 --> 15:51.385
YOU BORED?

15:51.385 --> 15:54.301
'CAUSE WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
THAT I'M BORED, TOO?

15:54.301 --> 15:55.955
WHAT IF I SAID
THAT I'LL--I'LL DIE

15:55.955 --> 15:58.870
IF I HAVE TO SEE ONE MORE
PINE BRANCH FOOTSTOOL?

15:58.870 --> 16:02.396
OH, THE "I'M
JUST ANOTHER OUTSIDER
LIKE YOU" TRICK?

16:02.396 --> 16:04.659
BE CAREFUL.
YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO PIERCE YOUR TONGUE

16:04.659 --> 16:05.790
TO PROVE IT TO ME.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.578
MYRA.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.667
HAVE I TOLD YOU THE SECRET
TO HIGH SCHOOL?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.235
THE REASON WHY
IT'S SUCH A NIGHTMARE?

16:15.235 --> 16:17.759
IT'S SO KIDS'LL WORK REALLY,
REALLY HARD TO LEAVE,

16:17.759 --> 16:19.456
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE ONES WHO DON'T?

16:19.456 --> 16:21.023
THEY TURN INTO ME.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.767
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

16:25.767 --> 16:29.466
TO HAVE TO TEACH SHOP
TO PUT FOOD ON YOUR TABLE?

16:29.466 --> 16:32.382
TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
MAKING SPEECHES LIKE THIS?

16:43.089 --> 16:45.265
Kirsten: OK. PATIENT'S NAME,
KATHLEEN O'NEILL.

16:45.265 --> 16:49.399
GOOD. EXCEPT THAT,
UM, THE LAST NAME
HAS TO GO FIRST,

16:49.399 --> 16:51.749
AND THE MIDDLE INITIAL
GOES HERE, NOT HERE.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.751
AND IT NEEDS TO BE
IN BLOCK PRINT.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.319
IT'S JUST A COUPLE
OF THE DOCTOR'S PET PEEVES.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.758
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
WHY DON'T I FINISH THESE UP,

17:00.758 --> 17:02.760
AND THEN WE CAN GO
OVER THEM LATER?

17:02.760 --> 17:03.761
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

17:03.761 --> 17:07.504
FANTASTIC, KIRSTEN.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.812
SHE'S ALMOST
GOT IT.

17:10.812 --> 17:14.076
HEY, MUFFIN-HEAD.
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.

17:14.076 --> 17:18.602
THE SQUARE SHAPE GOES
IN THE SQUARE HOLE.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.952
LIKE THAT. GOOD!

17:20.952 --> 17:22.432
Kirsten: HEY,
DAPH.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.781
MAYBE IT'S
BETTER

17:23.781 --> 17:25.261
IF SHE
FIGURES IT OUT
FOR HERSELF.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.568
OH, RIGHT. SORRY.

17:27.568 --> 17:30.484
Victor: YEAH,
'CAUSE OTHERWISE,
HOW WILL SHE LEARN?

17:31.659 --> 17:32.834
RIGHT, KIRSTEN?

17:37.143 --> 17:38.100
RIGHT.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.842
Daphne:
THANK YOU, VICTOR.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.545
[CLICK]

17:48.545 --> 17:50.243
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN
YOUR EYES.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.506
HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.204
"I FOR YOUR JOY WOULD
GLADLY LAY MINE DOWN,

17:55.204 --> 17:56.814
"THOUGH YOU WERE NEVER
TO KNOW IT.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.861
"TOO FAIR THE NIGHT,
THAT I SHOULD
SPEAK THUS,

17:59.861 --> 18:01.558
THAT YOU SHOULD
HEAR ME."

18:02.951 --> 18:04.518
IT'S FROM CYRANO.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.216
EVERY NIGHT HE WOULD
LOOK INTO HER EYES,

18:07.216 --> 18:08.609
AND SHE WOULD LOOK
INTO HIS.

18:08.609 --> 18:12.482
YOUR MOM AND THAT--
THAT WILLIAM GUY?

18:12.482 --> 18:14.832
WILLIAM LANFORD.

18:14.832 --> 18:18.314
I MEAN, HOW COULD
THEY SAY THESE WORDS
TO EACH OTHER

18:18.314 --> 18:20.621
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
AND NOT FALL IN LOVE?

18:20.621 --> 18:23.232
OH, COME ON, SARAH.
THEY WERE ACTING.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.757
NO. ROBIN TOLD MINDY
THEY WERE WONDERFUL
TOGETHER.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.063
OK, BUT THAT STILL
DOESN'T MEAN--

18:28.063 --> 18:30.196
AND I WAS BORN A
LITTLE MORE THAN 9 MONTHS

18:30.196 --> 18:31.893
AFTER THE PLAY
OPENED.

18:31.893 --> 18:34.025
WHAT?

18:34.025 --> 18:37.507
PRODUCTION STARTED
FEBRUARY '78
AND ENDED IN MAY.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.990
THIS MAN COULD BE
MY FATHER, BAILEY.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.340
I MEAN,
IT'S POSSIBLE.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.430
OK.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.258
I DID
AN INTERNET SEARCH.

18:49.258 --> 18:53.871
AND IT CAME UP
WILLIAM LANFORD STUDIO,
COLUMBUS AVENUE.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.831
HE'S STILL THERE,
BAILEY. IN NEW YORK.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.876
DID YOU GET
A PHONE NUMBER?

18:58.876 --> 19:02.837
INSTEAD OF CALLING,
I THOUGHT I'D GO.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.752
TO NEW YORK?

19:04.752 --> 19:07.798
WELL, IT'S A LOT
HARDER TO SLAM A DOOR
IN SOMEBODY'S FACE

19:07.798 --> 19:09.539
THAN TO JUST SLAM
DOWN A TELEPHONE.

19:09.539 --> 19:12.063
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
CONSIDERING FLYING
ALL THE WAY TO NEW YORK?

19:12.063 --> 19:14.457
I'M NOT CONSIDERING
IT, BAILEY.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.679
I ALREADY BOUGHT
THE TICKET.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.483
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

19:40.483 --> 19:43.660
I'M JUST LOOKING
AT PICTURES, TRYING
TO JOG MY MEMORY.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.227
MM-HMM.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.363
"ELBOW CROOKED,
PULLING HER HEAD TO HIM.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.583
HIS HAND ON HER ARM,
HIS HAND ON HER NECK..."

19:53.583 --> 19:55.759
BAILEY.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.849
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, JULE?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.982
WHAT--WHAT POINT
ARE YOU MAKING THERE?

20:00.982 --> 20:02.549
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE STUFF OUT.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.594
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT HE LIKED
TO CONTROL HER?

20:04.594 --> 20:05.552
IS THAT RIGHT?

20:05.552 --> 20:07.162
I'M WRITING
WHAT I SEE.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.991
SO THAT'S
THE BIG ANGLE HERE

20:09.991 --> 20:11.384
FOR THIS BOOK.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.907
THAT DAD WAS LIKE NED,
AND MOM WAS LIKE YOU,

20:12.907 --> 20:14.213
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU GOT ABUSED.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.953
WHAT IF IT
IS? WHAT IF THAT'S A PART OF IT?

20:15.953 --> 20:19.957
JULIA, YOU ARE PUTTING
ALL OF THESE WHAT-IFS
INTO A BOOK.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.873
YOU'RE MAKING MOM AND DAD
OUT TO BE THESE VILLAINS

20:22.873 --> 20:24.179
TO THOUSANDS OF STRANGERS.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.572
NO ONE IS A VILLAIN,
BAILEY.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.790
THAT IS THE POINT!

20:26.790 --> 20:28.270
NOT MOM, NOT DAD,
NOT EVEN NED.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.315
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

20:29.315 --> 20:30.664
JULIA, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

20:30.664 --> 20:32.100
I THINK THIS IS
A REALLY NICE WAY FOR YOU

20:32.100 --> 20:33.623
TO LET YOURSELF
OFF THE HOOK.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.538
I THINK IT'S
REALLY NICE WAY

20:35.538 --> 20:37.018
FOR YOU TO MAKE IT OK
THAT YOU'RE BLAMING

20:37.018 --> 20:38.498
EVERYONE ELSE FOR THIS
BUT YOURSELF.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.673
I AM
JUST TRYING--

20:39.673 --> 20:41.501
I AM TRYING
REALLY HARD

20:41.501 --> 20:42.850
TO MAKE SENSE
OF ALL OF THIS.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.504
SO FINE THEN, JULIA,
MAKE SENSE OF IT.

20:44.504 --> 20:47.985
JUST DON'T PILE IT
ALL ON MOM AND DAD, OK?

20:47.985 --> 20:51.554
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STOP DIGGING AROUND
IN THE PAST

20:51.554 --> 20:53.252
FOR ALL YOUR ANSWERS
AND START LOOKING
FOR THE ONES

20:53.252 --> 20:55.993
THAT ARE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

21:04.175 --> 21:08.223
SO, HOW HEAVY
AM I SUPPOSED
TO MAKE THIS THING?

21:08.223 --> 21:10.747
HOW HEAVY?

21:10.747 --> 21:12.314
YEAH, THE PART THAT
CHOPS OFF THEIR HEADS.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.534
THE BLADE--HOW HEAVY?

21:14.534 --> 21:16.971
I DON'T KNOW.

21:16.971 --> 21:22.672
UM, HEAVY ENOUGH
TO CUT THE TIPS OFF
YOUR OLD MAN'S CIGARS?

21:22.672 --> 21:24.718
IF I HAD
AN OLD MAN.

21:24.718 --> 21:29.766
OR IF I STARTED
SMOKING CIGARS.

21:29.766 --> 21:33.204
JUST YOU
AND YOUR MOM, HUH?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.771
MOST OF THE TIME
IT'S JUST ME.

21:34.771 --> 21:37.078
SO, YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
HOW TO USE THIS THING,

21:37.078 --> 21:40.821
OR SHOULD I JUST
CUT MY THUMB OFF?

21:43.650 --> 21:46.305
ALL RIGHT, LET ME
GET IN THERE.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.619
OK, ACCORDING
TO THE SAUNDERS REVIEW,

21:56.619 --> 21:58.273
THE IVYS WON'T EVEN
LET US ON CAMPUS

21:58.273 --> 22:02.495
UNLESS WE HAVE
3 SYNONYMS FOR WORDS
LIKE, UH, ISCARIOT.

22:02.495 --> 22:06.237
APOSTATE, QUISLING--
OH, AND HERE'S
AN APPROPRIATE ONE--

22:06.237 --> 22:08.283
TRAITOR.

22:08.283 --> 22:10.981
WHAT?

22:10.981 --> 22:12.592
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:12.592 --> 22:14.463
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT ONE
OF THE HARDEST THINGS

22:14.463 --> 22:16.422
WAS KNOWING
WHO YOUR REAL
FRIENDS ARE.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.728
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN?

22:18.728 --> 22:21.035
A LITTLE GIRL-TALK
AT THE GYM

22:21.035 --> 22:22.993
GOES A LONG WAY,
HUH, CLAUDIA?

22:24.299 --> 22:25.561
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE HOW YOU USE

22:25.561 --> 22:27.128
THE REST OF THE STUFF
I TOLD YOU.

22:27.128 --> 22:30.174
OK, WAIT, YOU GUYS--
WHY WOULD I DO THIS?

22:30.174 --> 22:31.219
NOBODY STARTED
TRASHING US

22:31.219 --> 22:32.612
TILL WE HUNG OUT
WITH YOU.

22:32.612 --> 22:35.919
I MEAN, WHO ELSE KNOWS
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT US?

22:35.919 --> 22:37.181
IT WASN'T ME.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.444
WELL, WHO WAS IT,
THEN?

22:38.444 --> 22:39.880
AND WHY WOULD
THEY DO THIS?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.883
I REALLY
HAVE NO IDEA.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.851
OH, HERE WE GO.

22:54.851 --> 22:57.463
HEY.HI!

22:57.463 --> 22:59.421
OK, IT'S
YOUR TURN.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.641
I'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.077
HI.
HI.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.818
ARE YOU--YOU
TAKING OFF?

23:04.818 --> 23:08.865
UHH, WELL, I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.650
I JUST QUIT.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.480
YOU QUIT?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.395
LOOK, I AM SORRY--
I AM, I'M SORRY,

23:16.395 --> 23:18.309
BUT I CAN'T,
I CAN'T DO THIS.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.920
DAPHNE, YOU'RE
DOING FINE,

23:19.920 --> 23:22.009
WHICH, FRANKLY,
I WASN'T EVEN SURE
THAT YOU COULD.

23:22.009 --> 23:24.011
KIRSTEN, I'M
WORKING MY ASS OFF!

23:24.011 --> 23:25.621
AND YOU'RE
MAKING IT!

23:25.621 --> 23:27.362
NO, I AM HATING IT!

23:27.362 --> 23:29.364
I AM NOT
THE KIND OF PERSON

23:29.364 --> 23:33.281
THAT CAN DO
THE SAME THING
EVERY DAY

23:33.281 --> 23:34.630
AND CALL
THAT "LIVING."

23:34.630 --> 23:37.938
I CAN'T--I CAN'T BE--
I CAN'T BE LIKE--

23:37.938 --> 23:39.418
LIKE ME?

23:41.158 --> 23:43.378
LIKE ME,
YOU MEAN?

23:43.378 --> 23:46.294
NO, I DIDN'T
SAY THAT.

23:46.294 --> 23:49.253
DAPHNE...

23:49.253 --> 23:51.560
THIS IS THE WAY
THE WORLD WORKS, OK?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.606
YOU DON'T JUST
GET TO DO WHAT YOU WANT.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.042
YOU DO WHAT
YOU HAVE TO.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.739
LOOK, KIRSTEN,
IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE--

23:56.739 --> 23:58.219
YOU THINK THAT
I WANT TO BE DOING
EXACTLY THIS

23:58.219 --> 23:59.481
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE?

23:59.481 --> 24:00.526
'CAUSE I DON'T.

24:00.526 --> 24:04.051
YOU CAN QUIT
THIS JOB, DAPHNE,

24:04.051 --> 24:06.706
BUT NEXT TIME,
BE CAREFUL.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.447
BECAUSE BY THE TIME
YOU FIGURE OUT

24:08.447 --> 24:09.665
WHAT YOU DOWANT TO DO

24:09.665 --> 24:11.232
WITH YOUR RESUME...

24:12.799 --> 24:14.975
THEY MIGHT NOT
HIRE YOU.

24:21.329 --> 24:22.722
CLASSIFIEDS?

24:22.722 --> 24:24.724
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR,
CHAPTER 3?

24:24.724 --> 24:26.639
TRYING TO FIND
AN APARTMENT.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.597
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LIVING AT HOME.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.120
WELL, I WAS GOING
TO FIND MY OWN PLACE,

24:30.120 --> 24:31.513
AND THEN I THOUGHT
I'D STAY AT HOME,

24:31.513 --> 24:33.036
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.385
FAMILIES...

24:34.385 --> 24:35.909
CAN'T LIVE
WITH THEM,

24:35.909 --> 24:37.258
CAN'T DISPOSE
OF THEIR LIMBS

24:37.258 --> 24:38.389
WITHOUT
DRAWING ATTENTION.

24:38.389 --> 24:39.956
YEAH.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.916
BUT IT'S--IT'S NOT
JUST MY FAMILY.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.788
EVAN STILMAN.
THE GUY KEEPS
PUSHING ME

24:45.788 --> 24:48.356
AND IT'S
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.184
THE WAY
HE JUST SITS THERE,

24:50.184 --> 24:51.402
TELLING ME
WHAT TO THINK,

24:51.402 --> 24:53.317
LIKE WHAT I'VE WRITTEN
ARE JUST WORDS,

24:53.317 --> 24:56.451
WHEN THIS STUFF,
IT--IT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED TO ME.

24:56.451 --> 24:59.715
WELL, OK, BUT YOU
GOTTA EXPECT HIM

24:59.715 --> 25:02.065
TO BE KIND OF FROSTY,
CONSIDERING.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.546
CONSIDERING WHAT?

25:04.546 --> 25:06.287
WELL, DUH, HIS WIFE
OFFED HERSELF.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.636
WHO WOULDN'T
GET COLD

25:07.636 --> 25:09.333
AFTER SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

25:11.292 --> 25:12.641
I'M SORRY,
"OFFED HERSELF"?

25:12.641 --> 25:14.991
OH, YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT?

25:21.955 --> 25:23.609
HEY, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING

25:23.609 --> 25:25.001
I SHOULD STAY
SOMEPLACE NICE,

25:25.001 --> 25:27.395
IN CASE THINGS
DON'T PAN OUT.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.092
OH, THAT'S PROBABLY
STUPID, RIGHT?

25:29.092 --> 25:32.356
MAYBE TOO EXPENSIVE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:32.356 --> 25:35.272
I THINK IT'S YOUR TRIP,
IT'S UP TO YOU.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.536
OK, THANK YOU.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.713
WELL, THEN DON'T ASK
WHAT I THINK.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.412
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST 5 DAYS

25:44.412 --> 25:46.153
LOOKING FOR MY DAD,
BAILEY.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.198
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

25:48.198 --> 25:50.984
AND THEN WHAT?

25:52.507 --> 25:53.987
AND THEN
I COME BACK.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.816
AND THEN WHAT?

25:56.816 --> 25:59.993
AND THEN--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:59.993 --> 26:05.259
THEN...ALL YOUR
QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED?

26:05.259 --> 26:07.740
I JUST WANT
TO MEET MY FATHER.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.785
BAILEY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THIS.

26:09.785 --> 26:12.832
IT IS NATURAL FOR YOU
TO WANT TO MEET HIM.

26:12.832 --> 26:16.792
I WANTYOU TO MEET HIM.
IT'S JUST--

26:16.792 --> 26:18.185
MAYBE HE AND YOUR MOM

26:18.185 --> 26:19.839
WERE TOGETHER
AT SOME POINT.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.015
BUT YOU KNOW THAT THEY WEREN'T
TOGETHER WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

26:22.015 --> 26:25.714
AND YET, YOU'RE RACING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY
TO SEE THIS GUY,

26:25.714 --> 26:27.977
LIKE--LIKE SEEING HIM

26:27.977 --> 26:31.764
IS GOING TO ANSWER
SOME DESPERATE QUESTION
FOR YOU.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.551
AND YOU THINK
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

26:36.551 --> 26:40.337
AND US, AND THE PROBLEMS
THAT WE'RE HAVING.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.776
I THINK IT IS.

26:45.255 --> 26:47.344
BUT, IF I'M WRONG...

26:48.911 --> 26:50.478
IF YOU TELL ME
THAT IT'S NOT,

26:50.478 --> 26:53.568
THEN I WILL STOP,
I PROMISE YOU.

26:53.568 --> 26:56.484
IF YOU TELL ME
THAT IT'S NOT.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.079
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:26.079 --> 27:28.081
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:28.081 --> 27:30.953
WHAT HAPPENED
TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

27:30.953 --> 27:33.434
ABOUT YOU TAKING
A HARDER LOOK
AT YOUR MOTHER.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.525
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST--I, UH,

27:37.525 --> 27:40.528
I DECIDED IT
WASN'T THE STORY.

27:40.528 --> 27:41.834
WHY NOT?

27:41.834 --> 27:44.488
LOOK, THIS BOOK
IS ABOUT ME, RIGHT?

27:44.488 --> 27:46.142
ABOUT MY STATE OF MIND.

27:46.142 --> 27:48.144
MY STATE OF MIND
ABOUT MY MOM IS NOT
WHAT YOU--

27:48.144 --> 27:50.277
JULIA, LISTEN,
I UNDERSTAND.

27:50.277 --> 27:53.149
ALL RIGHT, SHE'S GONE,
YOU DON'T WANT
TO JUDGE HER.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.282
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU CAN'T
BE HONEST.

27:56.239 --> 27:57.240
HONEST?

27:57.240 --> 27:58.633
UM-HMM.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.509
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT I SHOULD BE SAYING,

28:05.509 --> 28:08.469
'CAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME
YOU HAVE A PRETTY SPECIFIC
IDEA IN YOUR HEAD.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.558
JULIA, I'M--
NO, I GET
THE FEELING

28:10.558 --> 28:12.168
THAT THIS MATTERS
A LOT TO YOU.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.344
LIKE IT'S PERSONAL,
SOMEHOW.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.129
PERSONAL?

28:16.129 --> 28:20.481
YEAH. LIKE IT'S SOMETHING
YOU WENT THROUGH, TOO.

28:20.481 --> 28:23.832
LIKE SOMEONE DID
SOMETHING TO YOU,

28:23.832 --> 28:25.486
AND THERE'S STUFF
THAT YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT,

28:25.486 --> 28:28.750
LIKE THERE'S SOMEONE
YOU WANT TO BLAME.

28:31.840 --> 28:36.105
YOU'RE TALKING, UM,
ABOUT MY WIFE?

28:36.105 --> 28:39.413
I DON'T KNOW,
AM I?

28:39.413 --> 28:41.981
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT HER.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.985
YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T,

28:45.985 --> 28:49.075
SO I WOULD NEVER PRESUME
TO TELL YOU HOW YOU FEEL.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.946
I--

28:50.946 --> 28:52.948
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNCALLED FOR, JULIA.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.515
COMPLETELY.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

28:54.515 --> 28:56.560
LISTEN, EVAN,
I'M SORRY IF THIS
UPSETS YOU, BUT--

28:56.560 --> 28:59.041
WE'LL TAKE
THIS UP LATER.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.870
WE'RE DONE HERE.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.753
CLAUDIA! HOLD ON.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.972
OK, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY,
AND JUST BECAUSE I--

29:16.972 --> 29:18.147
NO, NO, WAIT--

29:18.147 --> 29:19.801
"AND WHAT ABOUT
CLAUDIA SALINGER?

29:19.801 --> 29:23.022
"BIG MOUTH,
BIG AMBITIONS,
BIG PHONY.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.372
"A DESPERATE CLIMBER
IN DISCOUNT BOOTS.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.895
"WHO'S SHE TRYING
TO FOOL?

29:26.895 --> 29:28.592
"HELLO,
IDENTITY WANTED.

29:28.592 --> 29:31.900
"CLAUDIA, IF YOU WANT
TO FIT IN SOMEWHERE...

29:31.900 --> 29:34.511
TRY K-MART."

29:34.511 --> 29:35.643
WHAT?

29:35.643 --> 29:37.471
I AM SO SORRY.

29:37.471 --> 29:40.909
WHY? YOU DIDN'T
WRITE IT.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.042
Alexa: I AM SUCH
A LOSER, CLAUDIA.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.565
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
IT WASN'T YOU.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.654
CAN I SEE THIS?

29:49.570 --> 29:52.007
CAMERON, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE IN HERE, TOO.

29:52.007 --> 29:56.055
YEAH, HE, LIKE,
EVISCERATED
BOTH OF YOU.

29:56.055 --> 29:59.449
"AND HERE, FROM
THE MAKING-US-PUKE
DEPARTMENT,

29:59.449 --> 30:01.147
"IT'S CAMERON WOLCOTT.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.062
"THERE'S SOMETHING
PATHETIC ABOUT A GUY

30:03.062 --> 30:04.803
"WHO'S HAD EVERYTHING
HANDED TO HIM

30:04.803 --> 30:08.545
"BUT CAN'T FEEL
GOOD ABOUT IT.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.417
"IF IT'S ALL
JUST TOO MUCH,
THEN TRY THIS:

30:10.417 --> 30:12.811
"RETURN YOUR CAR,
YOUR JET SKI--

30:12.811 --> 30:16.684
BUT KEEP THE RICH-BOY
GUILT, AS OUR GIFT."

30:18.251 --> 30:19.643
OUCH.

30:20.731 --> 30:23.299
GUESS HE NAILED YOU,
HUH?

30:23.299 --> 30:25.432
I THINK HE WAS
PRETTY KIND.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.833
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

30:34.833 --> 30:37.183
JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP
ON SOME OF THESE BILLS.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.141
I'VE BEEN PUTTING
THEM OFF

30:39.141 --> 30:41.404
BUT THEY DON'T
GO AWAY.

30:43.537 --> 30:49.935
I NEED TO...
FEEL SPONTANEOUS,
YOU KNOW?

30:49.935 --> 30:52.415
FIND MY FATHER,
IF I CAN,

30:52.415 --> 30:56.898
MAYBE EVEN FIND OUT
HE'S A WORLD-FAMOUS
CIRCUS ACROBAT,

30:56.898 --> 31:03.513
AND THAT I'VE BEEN GIVEN
A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION
TO DO TRIPLE SOMERSAULTS.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.776
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
JUST AN EXAMPLE.

31:09.215 --> 31:17.832
I JUST...
NEED TO FEEL 20
FOR A FEW DAYS.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.227
TO LOOK AT THE WORLD

31:21.227 --> 31:23.882
LIKE I DON'T LIVE
IN A 3-BEDROOM HOUSE

31:23.882 --> 31:27.929
WITH A GRAND PIANO
AND A VIEW OF THE BAY.

31:29.496 --> 31:33.369
LIKE I DON'T HAVE
KIND-OF A HUSBAND

31:33.369 --> 31:36.459
WHO GOES TO WORK
EVERY DAY

31:36.459 --> 31:39.419
AND COMES HOME,
WHERE I'M WAITING.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.118
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS TRIP IS ABOUT?

31:43.118 --> 31:44.903
YES.

31:47.122 --> 31:51.257
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU THINK MAKES IT
FOOLISH

31:51.257 --> 31:54.347
IS KIND OF
THE POINT.

31:54.347 --> 31:57.350
IT'S LIKE
I LEFT MY I.D.--

31:57.350 --> 31:58.742
YOU KNOW,
MY PASSPORT--

31:58.742 --> 32:00.222
IN THE MIDDLE
OF NEW YORK CITY,

32:00.222 --> 32:02.703
AND I HAVE TO
GO AND GET IT

32:02.703 --> 32:04.618
AND BRING IT
BACK HOME,

32:04.618 --> 32:06.837
SO THAT
THE TWO OF US

32:06.837 --> 32:10.754
CAN GO ANYWHERE
TOGETHER.

32:13.975 --> 32:16.717
PLEASE.

32:16.717 --> 32:21.330
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT
SUCH A SCARY THOUGHT,
IS IT?

32:28.033 --> 32:29.121
NO.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.792
HEY.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.011
LISTEN, JULIA, THE REASON THAT
I'M HERE--

32:50.011 --> 32:51.752
IF YOU CAME HERE
TO YELL AT ME,

32:51.752 --> 32:54.102
I WAS WAY
OUT OF LINE.

32:54.102 --> 32:56.278
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
TRYING TO PUT
ALL THAT STUFF

32:56.278 --> 32:57.453
ABOUT YOUR WIFE
IN MY BOOK.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.282
I'M JUST--
I'M REALLY NOT COMFORTABLE

33:00.282 --> 33:02.806
BLAMING MY PARENTS,
I'M REALLY NOT.
SO, I'M SORRY.

33:02.806 --> 33:05.461
NO, NO--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.550
YOU KNOW,
I GO THROUGH
THE SAME THING,

33:07.550 --> 33:09.030
EVERY DAY.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.076
I--I TRY TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF WHAT SHE DID,

33:11.076 --> 33:14.644
AND IT MAKES ME MAD,
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES ME
BLAME HER FOR LEAVING.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.430
BUT, I MEAN--

33:17.430 --> 33:19.649
HOW CAN I NOT
FORGIVE HER?

33:20.911 --> 33:23.305
I HAVE TO.

33:23.305 --> 33:26.134
YOU KNOW,
I MISS HER.

33:28.354 --> 33:29.790
WHICH IS JUST
TO SAY--

33:29.790 --> 33:32.836
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THE WAYS

33:32.836 --> 33:34.621
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE
LET YOU DOWN.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.798
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
TRYING TO BLAME THEM,

33:37.798 --> 33:40.627
YOU'RE TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND.

33:40.627 --> 33:41.845
AND YOU CAN BE
DISAPPOINTED

33:41.845 --> 33:44.631
AND STILL GO ON
LOVING THEM, JULIA.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.156
JUST LIKE YOU DID
WHEN THEY WERE HERE.

33:58.471 --> 33:59.776
HEY.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.997
HI. YOU'RE LEAVING.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.955
YEAH, YEAH,
I WAS HEADED HOME.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.219
WHY, DO YOU--
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

34:07.219 --> 34:10.178
NO.

34:10.178 --> 34:12.311
WELL, ACTUALLY...

34:12.311 --> 34:13.834
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT, LIKE,

34:13.834 --> 34:19.492
SINE AND COSINE
AND...THE OTHER ONE?

34:19.492 --> 34:20.667
TANGENT?

34:20.667 --> 34:23.626
HIM.

34:23.626 --> 34:26.281
IF YOU'RE LEAVING,
THOUGH, WHATEVER--
I CAN BLOW IT OFF.

34:26.281 --> 34:27.543
NO--NO--NO--NO,
NO, NO, NO.

34:27.543 --> 34:31.373
I MEAN, I CAN--
I CAN TAKE A LOOK.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.769
UM...

34:35.769 --> 34:36.900
WHEN WE'RE DONE
WITH THAT,

34:36.900 --> 34:38.380
DO YOU SPEAK FRENCH?

34:38.380 --> 34:41.166
'CAUSE,
MY FRENCH HOMEWORK,

34:41.166 --> 34:42.384
LIKE,
IT'S IN FRENCH,

34:42.384 --> 34:46.084
BUT IT'S COMPLETELY
GREEK TO ME.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.790
PACKING UP
ALL YOUR STUFF?

34:56.790 --> 35:00.010
YEAH, MY FRIEND ISABEL
SAID I COULD CRASH
AT HER PLACE

35:00.010 --> 35:01.838
TILL I FIND
AN APARTMENT.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.623
DOES BAILEY KNOW?

35:03.623 --> 35:06.756
OH, BELIEVE ME,
IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM
WHEN HE FINDS OUT.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.541
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.934
HE IS SONOT INTO
THIS BOOK I'M WRITING.

35:10.934 --> 35:13.067
I GUESS.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.677
TALK TO HIM, SARAH,
HE'LL TELL YOU.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.897
OH, I KNOW.

35:16.897 --> 35:20.379
BUT I ALSO KNOW
THAT NOBODY
WORKS HARDER

35:20.379 --> 35:21.902
TO KEEP THIS FAMILY
TOGETHER.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.644
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY HE WANTS ME
GONE RIGHT NOW,

35:24.644 --> 35:27.342
'CAUSE THIS BOOK--
WHICH I AM
GOING TO WRITE,

35:27.342 --> 35:28.604
NO MATTER
WHAT HE THINKS--

35:28.604 --> 35:31.651
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT'S TRUE, THOUGH?

35:31.651 --> 35:35.089
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE CARES ABOUT
YOU GUYS SO MUCH?

35:35.089 --> 35:38.745
IT'S BECAUSE BAILEY
NEEDS STUFF AROUND HIM
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.443
WHICH IS WHY HE LIVES
IN THIS HOUSE STILL,

35:41.443 --> 35:45.534
AND...LET'S FACE IT,

35:45.534 --> 35:47.536
WHY HE PROPOSED.

35:49.451 --> 35:52.672
AND WHY YOU
SHOULD STAY.

35:52.672 --> 35:55.544
HE REALLY NEEDS
YOU GUYS AROUND,
JULIA.

35:57.111 --> 35:59.635
HE REALLY
NEEDS YOU AROUND.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.384
BOY, BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US,

36:09.384 --> 36:10.907
WE HAVE
ABOUT 100 KIDS.

36:10.907 --> 36:12.909
I MEAN,
WITH MY CLINIC--

36:12.909 --> 36:16.435
MY STUDENTS.
DIANA.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.654
HER MOTHER.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.700
[LAUGHING]

36:22.832 --> 36:24.530
IT FEELS GOOD,
THOUGH, ACTUALLY.

36:24.530 --> 36:26.140
DON'T YOU THINK?

36:26.140 --> 36:29.709
ASK ME WHEN MY FEET
STOP THROBBING.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.761
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD,
THOUGH, CHARLIE?

36:39.936 --> 36:42.156
I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME

36:42.156 --> 36:44.506
BELIEVING I'D NEVER
HAVE KIDS--

36:44.506 --> 36:46.726
OF MY OWN, I MEAN...

36:49.642 --> 36:52.340
I'VE BASICALLY JUST
LEARNED TO ACCEPT THAT.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.212
YEAH?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.518
YOU KNOW, FIRST WITH
MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS,

36:56.518 --> 37:01.088
THEN MARRYING SOMEONE
WHO DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

37:01.088 --> 37:04.309
BUT THE TRUTH IS,

37:04.309 --> 37:06.528
MAYBE I COULD.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.313
I DON'T HAVE
TO ACCEPT THAT.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.662
KIRSTEN,
WHAT ARE YOU--

37:09.662 --> 37:11.185
I LOVE
ALL OF THE KIDS

37:11.185 --> 37:15.668
THAT WE HAVE
IN OUR LIVES,
CHARLIE, I DO.

37:15.668 --> 37:18.018
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING,
AND...

37:18.018 --> 37:21.500
AND REALLY--
IT DOESN'T COMPARE

37:21.500 --> 37:24.329
TO THE FEELING
OF HAVING OUR OWN.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.069
OUR OWN.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.683
YOU MEAN--

37:30.683 --> 37:34.687
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
BY ADOPTING?

37:34.687 --> 37:38.908
I DON'T KNOW.

37:38.908 --> 37:42.172
I DON'T KNOW, BUT JUST
SAYING THE WORDS NOW--

37:42.172 --> 37:47.265
THE CONCEPT OF HAVING
A BABY WITH YOU...

37:49.658 --> 37:51.312
I WANT THAT.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.445
I WANT THAT
SO BADLY.

37:53.445 --> 37:58.058
HEY, COME HERE.

37:58.058 --> 38:02.497
JUST THE IDEA OF IT,
CHARLIE...

38:12.507 --> 38:15.162
OK, I'M GONNA PUT
THE MILK IN NOW,

38:15.162 --> 38:16.555
AND IF YOU
KEEP STIRRING

38:16.555 --> 38:19.340
YOU'LL GET ALL
THE LUMPS OUT, OK?

38:19.340 --> 38:20.515
THERE YOU GO.

38:20.515 --> 38:23.170
OK, WE'RE HEADED
TO THE AIRPORT.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.650
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
IN A COUPLE HOURS,
ALL RIGHT?

38:24.650 --> 38:26.260
OK, BAILEY,
BEFORE YOU GO,

38:26.260 --> 38:27.696
I MIGHT MISS YOU
TOMORROW, SO--

38:27.696 --> 38:28.915
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

38:28.915 --> 38:31.265
THAT I'VE DECIDED
I'M NOT GONNA MOVE.

38:31.265 --> 38:34.007
I'M NOT GONNA
FIND MY OWN PLACE.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.882
REALLY?

38:39.882 --> 38:41.928
YEAH.

38:41.928 --> 38:43.799
I AM STILL GONNA
WRITE THIS BOOK, THOUGH,

38:43.799 --> 38:45.932
AND I WANT YOU
TO KNOW

38:45.932 --> 38:49.065
THAT IF YOU THINK
THIS IS EASY FOR ME,

38:49.065 --> 38:52.155
ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS
ABOUT MOM AND DAD,

38:52.155 --> 38:54.854
YOU'RE SO WRONG.

38:57.378 --> 39:00.381
BUT I ALSO--
DOING THIS,

39:00.381 --> 39:02.296
LETTING THEM BE
SOMETHING ELSE--

39:02.296 --> 39:04.385
IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME
FEEL CLOSER TO THEM.

39:04.385 --> 39:08.476
LIKE, MAYBE
I KNOW THEM BETTER.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.870
LIKE NOW, THEY CAN
ACTUALLY BE WHO THEY WERE,

39:10.870 --> 39:13.089
NOT WHO I WANT
THEM TO BE.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.442
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHAT
I WANTED TO SAY.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.834
THAT'S ALL.

39:30.890 --> 39:33.893
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
STAYING, JULE.

39:33.893 --> 39:35.808
I REALLY AM.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.775
Woman on P.A.:
NOW BOARDING
ROWS 30 TO 40

39:46.775 --> 39:50.910
ON FLIGHT 425
TO NEW YORK'S
KENNEDY AIRPORT.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.215
THAT'S ME.

39:53.652 --> 39:56.089
I SHOULD PROBABLY--

39:56.089 --> 39:57.220
WAIT--

40:02.487 --> 40:04.140
I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE GOING.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.665
BAILEY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

40:06.665 --> 40:08.449
NO, I REALLY DO.

40:08.449 --> 40:12.105
BUT EVEN
IF I DIDN'T,
YOU WANT THIS,

40:12.105 --> 40:13.323
AND I WOULD NEVER
STAND IN THE WAY

40:13.323 --> 40:15.761
OF SOMETHING THAT
YOU WANTED, EVER.

40:17.806 --> 40:19.678
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME?

40:20.679 --> 40:23.203
THE FLIGHT'S
NOT FULL.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.031
I CAN'T.

40:25.031 --> 40:27.337
I CAN'T, I'VE GOT
OWEN AT HOME,

40:27.337 --> 40:28.861
AND THE RESTAURANT--

40:28.861 --> 40:30.253
ANYWAY,

40:30.253 --> 40:33.256
YOU NEED TO TAKE
THIS TRIP ALONE.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.258
I MEAN, THAT'S PART
OF THE POINT, RIGHT?

40:37.783 --> 40:40.612
SAY HELLO
TO YOUR FATHER
FOR ME.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.660
HEY, HEY, NO--

40:47.357 --> 40:48.750
DON'T YOU BE SAD.

40:48.750 --> 40:52.145
YOU SHOULD SMILE.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.583
SMILE.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.283
YOU SHOW THAT
TO YOUR FATHER.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.721
IF THERE'S A HEART
IN THE MAN'S CHEST,

41:02.721 --> 41:03.809
YOU WILL OWN IT.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.245
BELIEVE ME.

41:05.245 --> 41:06.855
Woman on P.A.:
FINAL BOARDING,
ALL ROWS

41:06.855 --> 41:11.338
ON FLIGHT 425
TO NEW YORK'S
KENNEDY AIRPORT.

41:11.338 --> 41:12.948
ALL RIGHT.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.297
IT'S ONLY 5 DAYS,

41:14.297 --> 41:16.735
AND I WILL CALL YOU
EVERY MINUTE TILL THEN.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.954
YOU FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,

41:18.954 --> 41:21.435
SARAH,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.393
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

41:23.393 --> 41:26.788
I LOVE YOU,
YOU KNOW THAT.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.877
I KNOW IT.

41:28.877 --> 41:31.358
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

42:14.183 --> 42:15.663
GOOD-BYE.
