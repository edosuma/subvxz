WEBVTT

00:22.064 --> 00:24.771
( motorcycle approaching )

00:46.756 --> 00:48.496
Fever's gone down.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.425
Baby?

00:56.140 --> 00:58.426
Carl?

00:59.936 --> 01:01.676
Sophia?

01:01.854 --> 01:03.765
Is she okay?

01:03.940 --> 01:06.306
Fine.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.896
- She's fine.
- Lori: Rest.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.561
We'll be right here, okay?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.821
Okay.

01:22.708 --> 01:25.666
They're here.

01:40.351 --> 01:41.682
How is he?

01:41.852 --> 01:44.264
He'll pull through,

01:44.438 --> 01:46.554
thanks to Hershel
and his people.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.270
We'd have lost Carl
if not for him.

01:57.368 --> 02:00.075
Thank God.

02:00.246 --> 02:01.952
We were so worried.

02:02.123 --> 02:04.079
- How'd it happen?
- Hunting accident.

02:04.250 --> 02:08.038
That's all--
just a stupid accident.

02:15.094 --> 02:17.005
Blessed be God,

02:17.179 --> 02:20.967
Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.345
Praise be to Him

02:24.520 --> 02:27.387
for the gift
of our brother Otis,

02:28.816 --> 02:30.522
for his span of years,

02:30.693 --> 02:32.934
for his abundance
of character;

02:33.112 --> 02:36.275
Otis, who gave his life
to save a child's,

02:36.449 --> 02:39.612
now more than ever,
our most precious asset.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.949
We thank You, God, for the peace
he enjoys in Your embrace.

02:44.123 --> 02:46.739
He died as he lived,

02:46.917 --> 02:48.873
in grace.

02:51.464 --> 02:55.423
Shane, will you speak
for Otis?

02:55.593 --> 02:57.458
I'm not good at it.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.922
I'm sorry.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.928
Patricia:
You were the last one with him.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.636
You shared
his final moments.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.311
Please.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.060
I need to hear.

03:08.230 --> 03:12.018
I need to know
his death had meaning.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.726
Meaning.

03:19.784 --> 03:22.241
We were about done.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.652
Almost out of ammo.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.695
We were down
to pistols by then.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.957
lwas limping.
It was bad.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.664
Ankle all swollen up.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.959
"We've got to save the boy."

03:37.718 --> 03:39.549
See, that's what he said.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.551
- ( growling)
- ( gunshot)

03:43.224 --> 03:45.135
He gave me his backpack.
He shoved me ahead.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.549
(screaming )

03:46.727 --> 03:48.592
"Run," he said.

03:48.771 --> 03:52.309
He said, "I'll take the rear.
l'll cover you."

03:52.483 --> 03:54.019
(screaming )

03:54.193 --> 03:56.559
And when I looked back...

04:08.541 --> 04:10.657
If not for Otis,

04:13.337 --> 04:15.202
I'd have never
made it out alive.

04:15.381 --> 04:18.464
And that goes for Carl, too.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.501
It was Otis.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.589
He saved us both.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.930
If any death
ever had meaning,

04:34.108 --> 04:35.348
it was his.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.117
(theme music playing )

05:23.449 --> 05:25.110
How long has this girl
been lost?

05:25.284 --> 05:27.366
This'll be day three.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.822
County survey map.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.079
Shows terrain and elevations.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.534
This is perfect. We can finally
get this thing organized.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.998
We'll grid the whole area,
start searching in teams.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.004
Not you. Not today.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.040
You gave three units
of blood.

05:43.219 --> 05:47.132
You wouldn't be hiking five minutes
in this heat before passing out.

05:47.306 --> 05:50.389
And your ankle-- push it now,
you'll be laid up a month,

05:50.559 --> 05:52.220
no good to anybody.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.895
Guess it's just me.

05:54.063 --> 05:56.679
I'm gonna head back to the creek,
work my way from there.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.393
I can still be useful.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.559
l'll drive up to the interstate,
see if Sophia wandered back.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.944
All right, tomorrow then.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.900
We'll start doing this right.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.316
That means we can't have
our people out there with just knives.

06:08.494 --> 06:11.827
They need the gun training
we've been promising them.

06:11.997 --> 06:16.286
I'd prefer you not carrying
guns on my property.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.829
We've managed so far without
turning this into an armed camp.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.669
All due respect, you get a crowd
of those things wandering in here...

06:24.843 --> 06:26.674
Rick:
Look, we're guests here.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.006
This is your property

06:29.181 --> 06:31.467
and we will respect that.

06:41.110 --> 06:44.602
First things first:
set camp, find Sophia.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.317
I hate to be the one to ask,
but somebody's got to.

06:47.491 --> 06:49.447
What happens if we find her
and she's bit?

06:49.618 --> 06:52.109
I think we should all be
clear on how we handle that.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.704
You do what has to be done.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.739
And her mother?
What do you tell her?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.295
The truth.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.202
Shane: l'll gather and secure
all the weapons.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.251
I do request
one rifleman on lookout.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.886
Dale's got experience.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.258
Our people
would feel safer,

07:15.436 --> 07:17.677
lessincHned
to carry a gun.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.732
Thank you.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.154
That stuff you brought,

07:26.322 --> 07:28.654
got more antibiotics,
bandages, anything like that?

07:30.326 --> 07:32.282
Just what you've seen.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.910
We're running short already.
I should make a run into town.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.490
Not the place Shane went?

07:36.665 --> 07:39.202
No, there's a pharmacy
just a mile down the road.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.082
I've done it before.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.665
See our man there
in the baseball cap?

07:44.840 --> 07:46.296
That's Glenn,

07:46.467 --> 07:48.879
our go-to-town expert.

07:49.053 --> 07:51.294
I'd ask him along
just to be cautious.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.183
I hear he woke up.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.978
Yeah. He's in
and out, but yeah.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.319
He'll be all right.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.109
That's good.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.743
Did you mean it?

08:20.918 --> 08:23.000
What?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.627
You said stay.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.663
Did you mean it?

08:28.759 --> 08:31.501
Look, if you didn't
just say so.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.421
But do it now.
I need to know.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.216
I meant it.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.937
All right then.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.575
I hear you're fast on your feet
and know how to get in and out.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.617
Got a pharmacy run.
You in?

09:04.795 --> 09:07.628
Uh...

09:07.798 --> 09:10.210
Miss, what's the water
situation here?

09:10.384 --> 09:11.999
Got five wells on our land.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.554
House draws directly
from number one.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.337
Number-two well
is right over there.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.052
We use it for the cattle
but it's just as pure.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.512
Take what you need.
There's a cart and containers

09:21.687 --> 09:23.769
in the generator shed
behind the house.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.850
I'll go saddle
your horse then.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.691
Horse?

09:34.366 --> 09:35.822
Give up our guns?

09:35.993 --> 09:37.699
You heard Rick.
We're guests here.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.280
And you're okay with it?

09:39.455 --> 09:41.616
I don't recall being asked.
Now lay down your weapon.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.951
You may like rolling over,
I don't.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.616
Look, l have to strip and clean
them anyway.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.170
You still want to learn?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.662
Go on.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.837
All right.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.626
Sit down.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.261
Unload your weapon.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.844
Hey, hey.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.555
Check the chamber.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.765
Pull it back.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.100
Push that lever out.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.607
It'll slide off.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.028
You're halfway there.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.823
Daryl.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.458
You okay on your own?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.119
I'm better on my own.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.662
Don't worry,
I'll be back before dark.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.831
Hey.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.170
We got a base.

10:36.345 --> 10:39.337
We can get this search
properly organized now.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.255
You got a point
or are we just chatting?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.719
My point is it lets
you off the hook.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.761
You don't owe us anything.

10:46.939 --> 10:49.521
My other plans fell through.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.365
We could give you
more space.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.367
Set up over by the barn.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.870
No, no need for that.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.406
Better you stay close
to the house.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.666
I don't say
this easily, Rick.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.043
We don't normally
take in strangers.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.377
We don't normally
take in strangers.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.711
I can't have your people
thinking this is permanent.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.342
Once you find this girl
and your boy's fit for travel,

11:19.513 --> 11:21.879
I expect you'll move on.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.173
We need to be clear on that.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.284
Hello, farmer's daughter.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.702
Hi.
Here's your list.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.916
And, um,

11:55.090 --> 11:57.923
there's one other item.
I wrote it down separately.

11:58.093 --> 12:01.130
lt's personal. If we could be real
discreet about that, okay?

12:01.305 --> 12:02.886
Sure.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.967
Thank you.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.633
Uh, what is it?

12:07.811 --> 12:09.927
Kind of missing the point
of the whole discreet thing, Glenn.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.767
Oh, right. Um...

12:14.818 --> 12:17.150
ljust need to know
where to find it.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.151
Try the feminine
hygiene section.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.281
Oh.
Enough said.

12:23.452 --> 12:25.408
Consider it done.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.914
I'm not weak
and I'm not a coward.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.668
I never said you were.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.626
No, what I said
on the highway--

12:38.800 --> 12:40.961
I don't know
what that was,

12:41.136 --> 12:43.092
where it came from.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.800
That wasn't me.

12:47.809 --> 12:51.677
If it's okay, I'd rather you never told
anybody about that stuff I said.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.813
What stuff?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.850
I couldn't get a word
out of you all day.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.484
Say, man, you think
there's a snowball's chance

13:06.662 --> 13:07.947
we'll actually find
that little girl?

13:08.121 --> 13:11.454
For the first time in my life
I'm betting on the snowball.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.490
Yeah.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.455
Me, too.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.166
Do whatever we have to.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.798
I don't care if I have to
comb the woods like Rambo

13:21.969 --> 13:24.005
or fetch a pail of water.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.886
Everyone kicks in,
does their part.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.224
Am I right?

13:31.395 --> 13:34.762
Do your part,
don't complain.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.181
That's what I always--

13:38.527 --> 13:40.768
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.996
(hissing, growling)

13:57.170 --> 13:59.286
Looks like we've got us
a swimmer.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.211
Glenn: How long do you think
it's been down there?

14:07.389 --> 14:09.095
Andrea:
Long enough to grow gills.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.632
Lori: We can't leave it in there.
God knows what it's doing to the water.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.516
Shane:
We got to get it out.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.144
Easy.
Put a bullet in its head.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.020
I'll get a rope.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
Whoa, whoa, guys. No.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.313
Why not?
It's a good plan.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.943
It's a stupid plan.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.650
If that thing hasn't
contaminated the water yet,

14:25.824 --> 14:28.736
blowing its brains out
will finish the job.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.652
She's right.
Can't risk it.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.195
So it has to come out alive?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.329
So to speak.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.752
How do we do that?

14:39.463 --> 14:42.580
The interstate where you
broke down is here.

14:42.758 --> 14:44.714
There's your creek.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.466
My farm is here.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.048
We're looking out that way,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.053
south-southeast.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.681
We missed this branch
of the creek entirely.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.513
If she went
that direction,

14:55.687 --> 14:57.769
she'd be miles
from where we looked.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.430
Rick, take a moment.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.474
Come look.

15:13.497 --> 15:17.035
It's good to pause
for an occasional reminder.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.450
Of what?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.459
Whatever comes to mind.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.996
For me it's often God.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.756
No thoughts on that?

15:26.927 --> 15:29.714
Last time | asked God for a favor
and stopped to admire a view

15:29.888 --> 15:32.095
my son got shot.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.132
I try not to mix it up
with the Almighty anymore.

15:36.394 --> 15:40.307
Best we stay out
of each other's way.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.186
Lori told me your story--

15:43.360 --> 15:45.476
how you were shot,
the coma.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.485
Yet you came
out of it somehow.

15:47.656 --> 15:49.738
You did not feel
God's hand in yours?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.651
At that moment?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.821
No, I did not.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.375
In all the chaos you
found your wife and boy.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.501
Then he was shot
and he survived.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.286
That tells you nothing?

16:06.341 --> 16:09.378
It tells me God's got
a strange sense of humor.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.102
He's not going for it.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.362
Maybe 'cause a canned ham
don't kick and scream

16:30.532 --> 16:31.863
when you try to eat it.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.201
He's right. There's a reason the dead
didn't come back to life

16:37.372 --> 16:38.987
and start raiding
our cupboards.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.157
We need live bait.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.129
Have I mentioned that I really like
your new haircut?

16:52.304 --> 16:54.215
You have
a nice shaped head.

16:54.389 --> 16:56.220
Don't worry about it, bud.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.097
We're gonna get you out
of here in one piece.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.681
Living piece.
The living part is important.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.313
( exhales )

17:06.735 --> 17:09.067
- Nice and slow, please.
- We got you.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.319
Oh, you people are crazy.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.070
You want to get it out
of your well or not?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.323
Give us an eye
there, Maggie.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.454
( breathing heavily )

17:31.509 --> 17:33.249
Doing okay?

17:33.428 --> 17:35.293
Yup, doing great.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.588
Living the dream.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.237
Maggie:
Little lower. Little more.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.318
(snarling )

18:01.081 --> 18:02.821
( screams )

18:02.999 --> 18:04.705
- Get it! Get it!
- Grab it!

18:04.876 --> 18:06.582
- Grab it!
- ( screams )

18:09.172 --> 18:12.289
( screaming )
Get me out of here!

18:12.467 --> 18:14.549
(groaning)

18:14.719 --> 18:16.801
- ( snarling)
- ( whimpering)

18:16.972 --> 18:19.008
Get it off.
Get off.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.719
Get off!
Get me out!

18:21.893 --> 18:23.975
(straining)

18:24.145 --> 18:25.726
Hang on, Glenn!

18:25.897 --> 18:27.728
Glenn:
Get off me!

18:27.899 --> 18:29.560
This is bad.
Oh, my God.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.476
Guys, get me out!

18:32.654 --> 18:35.771
Come on, you guys.
Get me out of here!

18:38.159 --> 18:40.696
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.997
Get me out of here!

18:43.164 --> 18:44.950
- Pull!
- Pull! Pull!

18:45.125 --> 18:46.661
- Pull! Pull!
- Let's go, pull.

18:46.835 --> 18:49.668
Get me up.
Get me up.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.875
Come on, guys.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.586
- Glenn!
- Pu|| him up!

18:56.845 --> 18:58.460
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

18:58.638 --> 19:01.175
Pull me up!
Pull me up!

19:01.349 --> 19:03.965
Get me out of here!

19:06.187 --> 19:09.315
Are you okay?

19:09.482 --> 19:12.189
( panting )

19:14.988 --> 19:16.819
Back to the drawing board.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.696
Says you.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.826
(walker snarling )

20:54.337 --> 20:56.669
( sniffs )

20:56.840 --> 20:59.081
( liquid splatters)

21:29.122 --> 21:31.204
Sophia!

21:38.673 --> 21:41.005
Sophia!

21:57.275 --> 21:59.607
(snarling )

22:04.407 --> 22:06.819
- T-Dog: Come on, guys, pull.
- Shane: Come on, y'all.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.858
T-Dog: Almost there.
Come on, pull, guys.

22:09.037 --> 22:11.244
Come on.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.952
Come on, y'all.
Together.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.707
Almost there. Come on, pull.
Keep it coming.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.459
Shane: Come on, pull.
Watch out, Dog.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.292
Nice and easy.
Just a little more.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.582
(snarling )

22:23.760 --> 22:25.500
Come on, almost there.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.543
You've got to pull it, guys.

22:27.722 --> 22:30.008
lt's stuck!
Come on.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.686
- ( all straining)
- Pull!

22:55.416 --> 22:57.828
( groans )

22:58.002 --> 23:00.618
We should seal off
this well.

23:00.797 --> 23:03.880
Yeah, might be
a good idea.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.881
- So what do we do about--
- ( grunting )

23:17.355 --> 23:20.688
Good thing we didn't do
anything stupid like shoot it.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.499
We'll come again tomorrow.

23:44.674 --> 23:47.131
You know there's
always the chance--

23:47.302 --> 23:50.886
Don't. I really don't need
to hear it anymore, Andrea.

23:51.055 --> 23:54.013
Save the thoughts
and prayers.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.224
You never know, Carol.

24:16.205 --> 24:19.242
We can hang targets along
that fence line there.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.874
That rise, it gives
a natural backstop.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.294
It's a good idea.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.080
Thanks.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.169
So how long
before I can carry?

24:29.344 --> 24:31.551
( chuckles )
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

24:31.721 --> 24:34.428
I'm not in a very patient
frame of mind these days, Shane.

24:34.599 --> 24:36.840
- You might have noticed that.
- No shit.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.509
Look, I ain't worried
about you offing yourself,

24:39.687 --> 24:43.396
even though you got old Dale
pissing his pants lately.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.306
(Shane chuckles)

24:45.485 --> 24:47.692
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

24:47.862 --> 24:50.854
He did come within a minute
or so of being blown to hell

24:51.032 --> 24:52.613
because of me,
to be fair.

24:52.784 --> 24:56.368
Look, | see you have
the desire for gun work

24:56.537 --> 24:58.152
and desire will take
you a long way.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.868
But something you need to know,
so file this carefully.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.704
- I'm listening.
- Paper targets is one thing.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.459
Easy to hit
what ain't moving.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.621
But taking down
an assailant,

25:07.799 --> 25:09.630
one that's trying
to kill you,

25:09.801 --> 25:11.883
it's different.

25:14.097 --> 25:17.055
They say in that
kind of situation

25:17.225 --> 25:19.841
things slow down.
That's crap.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.101
They speed up.
Adrenalin, ha.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.648
lt'll cripple you
if you let it.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.556
You need to use
your instinct.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.225
You got to rule it out.

25:29.404 --> 25:32.362
Because somebody
is going to die

25:32.532 --> 25:35.194
and you'd better hope that you're
the one who's making that decision.

25:35.368 --> 25:38.826
How?
I mean, how do you do that?

25:38.996 --> 25:41.783
Turn off a switch.

25:43.418 --> 25:44.999
The switch.

25:45.169 --> 25:48.753
The one that makes
you scared or angry,

25:48.923 --> 25:50.754
sympathetic, whatever.

25:50.925 --> 25:54.509
You don't think.
You just-- you act.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.929
'Cause odds are somebody else
is counting on you.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.762
That's your partner.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.892
That's your friend.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.060
There ain't nothing easy
about taking a man's life

26:08.234 --> 26:11.692
no matter how little
value it may have.

26:11.863 --> 26:15.196
But when you get it done,

26:15.366 --> 26:17.743
you have to forget it.

26:19.287 --> 26:22.120
( chuckles )

26:22.290 --> 26:25.498
I guess I haven't quite
got that last part down yet.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.915
But you're getting there?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.956
I hope so.

26:37.221 --> 26:38.882
It's a good spot.

26:40.725 --> 26:42.306
It'll do.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.228
You know, normally

26:51.402 --> 26:53.188
this is the kind of thing
I'd do on my own.

26:53.362 --> 26:55.694
Solo.
( chuckles )

26:55.865 --> 26:58.197
It's sort of my thing,
you know?

26:58.367 --> 27:01.154
I'm a loner.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.497
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

27:08.961 --> 27:13.079
I saw the look on your face
back at the well.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.634
Never seen one
killed up close before?

27:18.012 --> 27:19.843
Guess it's kind
of a shock.

27:22.225 --> 27:25.012
You know, being out on
the road, we've seen a lot.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.928
Guess we've gotten
a little numb to it.

27:29.941 --> 27:33.433
Whoa.
I guess so.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.502
I'll go see what
antibiotics are left.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.254
What else is on the list?

27:55.424 --> 27:57.551
Uh...

27:57.718 --> 27:59.049
why don't you get started?

27:59.220 --> 28:01.552
What about you?

28:01.722 --> 28:04.555
I'm gonna look around,
see what's worth grabbing.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.182
Just some general stuff.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.678
What do you got?

28:41.846 --> 28:43.632
Uh... um...

28:43.806 --> 28:45.387
nothing.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.674
Just, like I said,
general stuff.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.638
Condoms?

28:49.812 --> 28:51.268
( gasps )

28:51.439 --> 28:53.430
You got a girlfriend
I don't know about?

28:53.608 --> 28:55.599
Me? No. No.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.438
Then you're a pretty
conﬁdentguy.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.025
No.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.281
No, no, no.
l-l-l wasn't--

29:04.452 --> 29:06.192
- I would never--
- Something wrong with me?

29:06.370 --> 29:08.110
No.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.075
No, |--

29:10.249 --> 29:12.035
( chuckles nervously )

29:12.209 --> 29:13.870
I would never have sex--

29:14.045 --> 29:17.458
Uh, l'm-- I'm lost.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.126
I'll have sex with you.

29:25.348 --> 29:27.634
Really?

29:27.808 --> 29:29.548
Why?

29:29.727 --> 29:31.058
You're asking questions?

29:31.228 --> 29:33.810
Okay, I can't help
wondering.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.472
It's not like our options
are vast these days.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.747
And you're not the only one
that's lonely.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.477
Wow.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.971
You need to reconsider.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.306
I beg your pardon?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.220
Asking us to leave.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.141
You need to reconsider.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.979
If you saw how it is
out there you wouldn't ask.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.985
You're a man of belief.

31:09.160 --> 31:11.651
If you believe anything,
believe that.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.319
You're putting me
on the spot.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.204
Well, I mean to.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.991
Those people look to me
for answers.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.081
| wish they didn't,
but they do.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.088
But I'm not asking
for them or myself.

31:24.258 --> 31:26.544
I'm asking for my boy.

31:26.719 --> 31:29.335
After the price
your friend Otis paid,

31:29.513 --> 31:31.378
the least you can do
is give it some thought.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.889
You're a plainspoken man.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.016
I'm a father.

31:36.187 --> 31:39.679
He's the one thing
I don't want to fail.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.610
lfeel like I do every day.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.491
I lied to him this morning.

31:51.202 --> 31:54.945
It wasn't a big lie,
but it was enough.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.698
My father didn't bother
with comforting lies.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.457
He used his fist.

32:00.628 --> 32:03.665
He was a loveless,
violent drunk

32:03.839 --> 32:05.454
and no good to anybody.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.420
He drove me from home
when l was 15.

32:08.594 --> 32:12.086
Didn't lay eyes on this place
again for many years.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.801
l was not
at his deathbed, Rick.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.636
I would not grant him that

32:16.811 --> 32:19.723
and to this day
do not regret it.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.389
Some men do not earn
the love of their sons.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.153
I don't see you
having that problem.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.197
Will you consider
my request?

32:39.375 --> 32:43.835
There are aspects to this,

32:44.004 --> 32:48.873
things that I can't
and won't discuss.

32:49.051 --> 32:52.214
But if you and your people
respect my rules,

32:52.388 --> 32:56.097
no promises,
but I will consider it.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.383
You have my word.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.271
You have mine.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.940
( footsteps )

33:12.408 --> 33:14.444
Hey.

33:19.248 --> 33:21.113
|'|| sit with him.

33:24.086 --> 33:26.077
He was awake earlier
when you were gone.

33:26.255 --> 33:28.166
He asked for you.

33:43.814 --> 33:46.351
_ |__
- Don't spoil it.

33:48.903 --> 33:50.609
So it was good.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.735
It was a one-time thing.

33:58.204 --> 34:01.037
- Everything go okay?
- Fine.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.407
Nothing happened.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.507
Did you find it?

34:49.922 --> 34:51.708
I cleaned up.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.463
Wanted it to be
nice for her.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.008
For a second I thought
I was in the wrong place.

35:06.355 --> 35:08.095
A flower?

35:09.733 --> 35:11.985
It's a Cherokee rose.

35:14.738 --> 35:18.196
The story is that
when American soldiers

35:18.367 --> 35:22.451
were moving lndians
off their land on the Trail of Tears

35:22.621 --> 35:26.580
the Cherokee mothers were
grieving and crying so much

35:26.750 --> 35:28.957
'cause they were losing their
little ones along the way

35:29.128 --> 35:32.746
from exposure and disease

35:32.923 --> 35:35.084
and starvation.

35:37.303 --> 35:40.636
A lot of them
just disappeared.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.764
So the elders,
they said a prayer;

35:43.934 --> 35:47.426
asked for a sign to uplift
the mothers' spirits,

35:47.604 --> 35:50.687
give them strength

35:50.858 --> 35:52.689
and hope.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.066
The next day this rose

35:58.240 --> 36:01.107
started to grow right where
the mothers' tears fell.

36:02.703 --> 36:05.285
I'm not fool enough

36:05.456 --> 36:09.369
to think there's any flowers
blooming for my brother.

36:12.796 --> 36:16.254
But I believe this one

36:16.425 --> 36:20.338
bloomed for your little girl.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.971
( laughs)

36:37.071 --> 36:38.857
She's gonna really
like it in here.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.046
Hey, Dad.

37:00.219 --> 37:01.550
Hey.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.093
( clears throat )

37:09.728 --> 37:11.468
Carl,

37:13.190 --> 37:15.351
I told you something earlier
today about Sophia--

37:15.526 --> 37:18.393
I know.
Mom told me.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.614
Here l was getting ready
to confess.

37:26.203 --> 37:29.115
I didn't mean to lie.
I just didn't want to worry you.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.780
It's a stupid excuse

37:31.959 --> 37:33.369
but it's all I got.

37:33.544 --> 37:35.409
It's okay.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.500
Do you think
we'll find her?

37:39.675 --> 37:41.666
I know we will.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.755
Well...

37:44.930 --> 37:46.511
(sighs)

37:46.682 --> 37:49.719
I don't know.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.681
But I truly believe it.

37:53.856 --> 37:56.518
You look tired.

37:56.692 --> 38:00.310
( chuckles )
I am tired.

38:00.487 --> 38:03.479
Hey, I'm like you now.

38:03.657 --> 38:06.069
We've both been shot.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.537
Isn't that weird?

38:09.705 --> 38:12.742
Yeah, I think your mother would
rather hear we got the same eyes.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.247
So let's keep that
between us.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.296
Since you're in
the club now,

38:20.466 --> 38:22.081
you get to wear the hat.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.545
Didn't you know?

38:34.229 --> 38:36.390
We'll pad the rim tomorrow
so it sits better.

38:36.565 --> 38:39.056
Won't you miss it?

38:41.278 --> 38:43.564
Maybe you'll let me borrow
it from time to time.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.695
We can share it.

38:45.866 --> 38:47.777
Okay.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.452
Sleep now.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.485
Okay.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.870
I love you, Dad.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.203
I love you.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.956
Are you putting them away?

40:42.774 --> 40:44.355
Stay with him
a while longer.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.938
I'll wait up.

42:05.899 --> 42:08.811
(urinating)

42:29.840 --> 42:32.547
( muffled sob )

42:45.605 --> 42:48.438
(theme music playing )
