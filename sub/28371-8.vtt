WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:03.003
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.308
GAIA: SHEIDHEDA,
THE DARK COMMANDER,

00:04.352 --> 00:06.354
HE'S GETTING
TOO STRONG.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.879
ECHO: BELLAMY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:09.922 --> 00:11.315
CLARKE'S DEAD.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.708
JOSEPHINE?

00:12.751 --> 00:14.405
THIS BODY'S NOT BIG
ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.624
TWO MINDS, ONE BRAIN.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.756
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING,
THIS BODY DIES.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.325
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT PRIMES
HAD A WAY TO SAVE KANE?

00:21.369 --> 00:22.500
TEACH THEM HOW
TO MAKE NIGHTBLOOD,

00:22.544 --> 00:24.198
AND THEN
THAT'S YOURS.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.287
HIS MIND IS GONNA GO
IN ANOTHER PERSON'S BODY?

00:26.330 --> 00:28.202
I'M AFRAID OF WHAT
WILL HAPPEN TO YOU

00:28.245 --> 00:29.899
-IF YOU LOSE HIM.
-I'LL DO IT.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.728
BELLAMY: JOSEPHINE WAS TAPPING
MORSE CODE ON HER ARM.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.730
IT MEANS
CLARKE'S ALIVE.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.427
DON'T TRY TO
CONTROL YOUR HAND.

00:36.471 --> 00:37.950
JUST LET IT MOVE.
TAKE A LOOK.

00:37.994 --> 00:39.561
-THE SHAPE OF THE ANOMALY.
-WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.041
THE ANOMALY
IS CALLING YOU

00:41.084 --> 00:42.477
JUST LIKE IT
CALLED ME.

00:42.520 --> 00:46.307
I GUESS WE BETTER SEE WHAT
THE HELL THIS ANOMALY WANTS.

01:06.718 --> 01:10.113
XAVIER: WELCOME
TO THE VERGE.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.814
DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL NEVER
GET USED TO THE SOUND.

01:18.382 --> 01:20.906
IS HE HERE?

01:23.822 --> 01:26.086
XAVIER: I GOT TO GET
THE POWER ON.

01:27.522 --> 01:30.351
FIRST, THE OLD MAN
CURES YOU.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.484
AND THEN YOU PUT
A BULLET IN HIS BRAIN.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.531
LOOK AT US FINISHING
EACH OTHER'S THOUGHTS.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.926
WHO'D HAVE THUNK WE'D TURN
INTO AN OLD, MARRIED COUPLE?

01:57.987 --> 02:00.381
DIYOZA: THOUGHT YOU SAID
RADIOS WERE NO GOOD HERE.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.470
XAVIER:
THEY'RE NOT.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.908
UH! NNGH...

02:05.951 --> 02:09.129
ALL SIGNALS GET
SUCKED UP BY THE ANOMALY.

02:09.172 --> 02:13.437
YOU PICK THEM UP HERE IN
ENDLESS, REPEATING WAVES

02:13.481 --> 02:15.570
OR SOMETHING.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.795
DIYOZA:
WHO'S THE GIRL?

02:23.839 --> 02:26.450
XAVIER:
PUT THAT DOWN.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.802
HE LOVED HER, DIDN'T HE?

02:30.846 --> 02:33.414
YOU CAN TELL
BY THE PICTURE.

02:33.457 --> 02:37.374
SHE WAS JUST LOOKING
TO GET LAID.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.507
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.901
YOU CAN ASK GABRIEL YOURSELF
WHEN WE GET TO THE ANOMALY.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.295
WEAPONS STAY HERE.

02:46.383 --> 02:48.646
-THAT'S FUNNY.
-IS IT?

02:48.690 --> 02:50.953
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
DURING THE RED SUN?

02:50.996 --> 02:52.520
HEARD ABOUT IT--

02:52.563 --> 02:56.219
TREE TOXINS,
MASS HYSTERIA,

02:56.263 --> 02:57.394
SOUNDS
LIKE A PARTY.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.179
IT'S NOT.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.572
THE ANOMALY HAS A SIMILAR
EFFECT ON THE PLANTS HERE,

03:01.616 --> 03:03.008
ONLY IT'S CONSTANT
AND WEIRDER.

03:03.052 --> 03:06.534
TRUST ME, YOU DO NOT
WANT TO BE ARMED.

03:06.577 --> 03:09.972
I WON'T TAKE YOU
IF YOU ARE.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.516
WHAT ABOUT THESE?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.257
BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT
50 DIFFERENT WAYS

03:34.301 --> 03:37.129
I CAN KILL YOU
WITH THEM.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.530
WHO ARE YOU?

03:46.574 --> 03:49.577
OCTAVIA. OCTAVIA.
OCTAVIA.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.449
OCTAVIA, IT'S OK.
OK. SHH SHH SHH.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.886
IT'S STARTING
TO REACH HER BRAIN.

03:54.930 --> 03:58.542
HEY, IT'S ME--

03:58.586 --> 04:01.676
DIYOZA, HMM?

04:03.634 --> 04:07.551
TWO SERPENTS,
ONE GARDEN.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.684
YEAH. GOOD GIRL.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.817
XAVIER: MOVE OVER.
I NEED TO SEE HER ARM.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.342
NNGH!

04:16.995 --> 04:18.127
UH...

04:18.170 --> 04:21.348
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
I'M CURIOUS.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.132
YOU EXPERIENCING
MEMORIES,

04:23.175 --> 04:27.397
THINGS YOU DON'T
QUITE UNDERSTAND?

04:35.623 --> 04:39.496
YOU LOOK PRETTY GOOD
FOR AN OLD MAN.

04:41.629 --> 04:44.284
SAY HI TO GABRIEL.

04:45.676 --> 04:49.767
YOU SAW THE SCAR.
HEH.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.030
I WOULD ASK ABOUT YOURS,
BUT THE STORY

04:52.074 --> 04:53.641
OF HOW YOU SLASHED
YOUR OWN THROAT

04:53.684 --> 04:56.948
WAS BIG NEWS
BEFORE WE LEFT EARTH.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.604
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

05:00.648 --> 05:03.912
TO THE ANOMALY
AS PLANNED.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.567
TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT
IT WANTS WITH YOU.

05:06.610 --> 05:09.439
OH, ABOUT THE GUN,
IF YOU BRING IT,

05:09.483 --> 05:11.485
YOU'LL MOST LIKELY
KILL ALL OF US,

05:11.528 --> 05:14.052
YOURSELF AND BABY
INCLUDED.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.490
IT'S UP TO YOU.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.060
COME ON.

05:25.629 --> 05:30.199
UH! HUH! UH...

05:30.242 --> 05:32.462
UGH...

05:32.506 --> 05:35.117
I GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.115
GAVIN...

06:17.159 --> 06:20.118
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.599
FOR THE GLORY AND
GRACE OF THE PRIMES.

06:22.643 --> 06:25.036
FOR THE GLORY AND
GRACE OF THE PRIMES.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.043
MAN: CONGRATULATIONS, GAVIN.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.568
YOUR SPIRIT SHALL LIVE
ETERNALLY.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.023
ABBY: I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS  IS.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.807
I JUST KNOW
THAT IT WORKS.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.983
NIYLAH: ABBY, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT ERASING A PERSON'S MIND.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.595
I KNOW WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT, HONEY.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.295
RAVEN: CAN I TALK
TO ABBY ALONE, PLEASE?

07:15.609 --> 07:18.655
YOU SAID WE CAME HERE
TO SAVE KANE,

07:18.699 --> 07:21.266
BUT YOU LEFT OUT HOW.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.967
THAT'S BECCA'S
SERUM, ISN'T IT?

07:27.098 --> 07:29.405
YES. IT IS.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.929
I SHOW THEM HOW TO MAKE
NIGHTBLOOD, THEY SAVE MARCUS.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.627
BUT BY TURNING HIM
INTO ONE OF THEM,

07:33.670 --> 07:35.367
BY MURDERING
THAT MAN OUT THERE

07:35.411 --> 07:36.499
AND KEEPING
KANE IN...

07:36.543 --> 07:38.719
GAVIN, COME WITH ME.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.547
ABBY--

07:40.590 --> 07:42.810
EXCUSE ME
FOR INTERRUPTING.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.682
IT'S NOT MURDER,
RAVEN.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.597
IT'S SACRIFICE.

07:47.641 --> 07:50.774
GAVIN WANTS THIS,
DON'T YOU, GAVIN?

07:50.818 --> 07:54.517
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD.

07:56.824 --> 07:59.043
YOU CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT HIM.

07:59.087 --> 08:02.830
DO YOU MIND?
ABBY, LOOK AT HIM.

08:02.873 --> 08:06.355
MA'AM,
IT'S OK.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.662
YOU'RE GIVING
ME A GIFT.

08:08.705 --> 08:11.360
AS A NULL, I COULD
NEVER DREAM

08:11.403 --> 08:12.622
OF A MOMENT
LIKE THIS.

08:12.666 --> 08:16.060
YOUR OFFERING IS ACCEPTED
WITH LOVE AND LIGHT.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.767
OH!

08:26.810 --> 08:29.030
NICE CATCH.

08:29.944 --> 08:33.513
DON'T WORRY.
HE FELT NO PAIN.

08:33.556 --> 08:38.605
SO MUCH FOR,
"FIRST, DO NO HARM."

08:43.000 --> 08:45.133
SO...

08:46.700 --> 08:49.137
HOW DO WE DO IT?

08:53.750 --> 08:54.969
JOSEPHINE: WELL?
ANY SIGN OF STROKE?

08:55.012 --> 08:56.971
HOW LONG UNTIL
OUR BRAIN MELTS?

08:57.014 --> 09:01.628
BEST GUESS--
36 HOURS,

09:01.671 --> 09:03.847
LESS IF YOU CAN'T KEEP
ON HER SIDE OF THE DIVIDE.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.894
OH, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.
SHE'S BACK IN HER CAGE.

09:06.937 --> 09:09.766
I JUST NEED TO STAY
AWAKE LONG ENOUGH

09:09.810 --> 09:11.376
FOR PRIYA
TO BUILD SOMETHING

09:11.420 --> 09:12.595
TO GENERATE THE EMP.

09:12.639 --> 09:13.901
YOU CAN'T TELL PRIYA
OR ANYONE ELSE,

09:13.944 --> 09:15.598
NOT UNTIL YOUR MOTHER
IS BACK AND WE'RE SURE

09:15.642 --> 09:18.732
WE CAN MAKE ENOUGH HOSTS
FOR YOU AND THE OTHERS.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.691
I'M CONFUSED.
I ALREADY HAVE A HOST.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.998
I JUST NEED YOU TO FINISH
WHAT YOU STARTED.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.695
WE TAKE OUT
MY MIND DRIVE,

09:25.739 --> 09:27.697
WE NUKE THE NEURAL
MESH WITH THE EMP,

09:27.741 --> 09:28.742
AND THEN WE
PUT IT BACK IN.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.221
PROBLEM SOLVED.

09:30.265 --> 09:33.790
JOSIE, WE HAVE A CHANCE
TO ERASE THIS SIN,

09:33.834 --> 09:35.487
TO GIVE CLARKE
HER BODY BACK,

09:35.531 --> 09:37.881
TO PUT YOU IN
A WILLING HOST.

09:37.925 --> 09:41.232
UH, ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

09:41.276 --> 09:44.105
-UH...
-OHH...

09:44.148 --> 09:46.063
UH, LOOK, DAD.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.370
I'VE SEEN INSIDE
THIS GIRL'S HEAD.

09:48.413 --> 09:49.893
I KNOW WHAT
SHE'S DONE.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.679
TRUST ME, IF WE
BRING HER BACK,

09:52.722 --> 09:55.595
SHE'LL KILL US ALL.

09:55.638 --> 09:58.119
I DON'T THINK
SHE WILL,

09:58.162 --> 10:01.383
NOT IF WE DO
THE RIGHT THING.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.558
STAY HERE.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.995
I'LL HAVE JADE FETCH YOU
CLARKE'S CLOTHES.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.827
SWEETHEART...

10:10.871 --> 10:13.395
WHEN THE UNIVERSE
GIVES YOU A SECOND CHANCE,

10:13.438 --> 10:15.832
YOU TAKE IT.

10:15.876 --> 10:19.270
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.
YOU'LL SEE.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.545
JACKSON: THANK GOD
SHE'S STILL IN THERE.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.069
IT WOULD HAVE
DESTROYED ABBY.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.419
BELLAMY: QUESTION IS,
HOW DO WE GET JOSEPHINE OUT?

10:37.462 --> 10:39.813
ECHO: WE NEED RAVEN.
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.771
MADI:
RAVEN'S NOT HERE.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.948
HEY, WE'RE GONNA
GET HER BACK.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.471
WHEN THE TRANSPORT
SHIP LANDS,

10:46.515 --> 10:48.386
WE'LL BE WAITING
IN THE FIELD WITH JOSEPHINE.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.301
ONCE WE'RE ALL BACK
ON THE MOTHERSHIP,

10:50.345 --> 10:52.782
ABBY, RAVEN, AND JACKSON
WILL GO TO WORK.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.697
WHAT IF THEY DON'T OPEN
THE SHIELD AND LET US OUT?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.220
ECHO: IF THEY DON'T,
JOSEPHINE DIES.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.614
-THAT'S WHY THEY WILL.
-WHAT ABOUT DELILAH?

10:58.658 --> 11:02.966
IF CLARKE'S STILL ALIVE,
THEN SHE COULD BE, TOO.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.229
YOU ONLY CARE
ABOUT CLARKE.

11:05.273 --> 11:08.406
THAT'S NOT TRUE, BUT WORRY
ABOUT CLARKE FOR NOW.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.844
WE START ASKING QUESTIONS
AND THE PRIMES FIGURE OUT WHY--

11:10.887 --> 11:14.282
THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT
OUT IF THEY'RE DEAD.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.069
ONCE WE KILL THE PRIMES,
WE TAKE OVER SANCTUM.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.724
WE SAVE CLARKE HERE IN THE LAB
THAT WAS BUILT FOR IT.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.422
IS THAT YOUR IDEA
OR SHEIDHEDA'S?

11:24.466 --> 11:26.294
WHO CARES
IF IT WORKS?

11:26.337 --> 11:28.775
I'VE BEEN SURVEILLING
THE ONE NAMED MIRANDA.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.820
WE KILL HER AND LET
THEM FIND THE BODY.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.517
THEY'LL THINK IT'S
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL

11:32.561 --> 11:34.955
AND PANIC, LOCKING THEMSELVES
INSIDE THE PALACE,

11:34.998 --> 11:36.739
PROBABLY THE GREAT HALL,
AND THAT'S WHERE

11:36.783 --> 11:38.741
WE'LL BE WAITING
TO TAKE OUT THE REST.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.612
WE'RE NOT
KILLING DELILAH.

11:40.656 --> 11:41.962
DELILAH'S ALREADY DEAD.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.746
WE DON'T KNOW
THAT FOR SURE.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.792
YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS,

11:45.835 --> 11:48.795
I'M THE COMMANDER.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.755
ECHO THINKS
IT'S A GOOD PLAN,

11:52.799 --> 11:55.497
DON'T YOU, SPY?

11:57.847 --> 12:00.371
A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE
FOR THE SITUATION,

12:00.415 --> 12:04.027
BUT IT COULD WORK
IF WE WERE WILLING

12:04.071 --> 12:06.377
TO KILL ALL OF THEIR
PEOPLE ALONG WITH THEM

12:06.421 --> 12:09.380
WHEN THEY COME AFTER US
FOR KILLING THEIR GODS.

12:14.995 --> 12:18.607
-WE ARE.
-NO, WE'RE NOT.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.957
GAIA WOULD TELL YOU
THE SAME THING IF SHE WERE HERE.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.872
WE HAVE UNTIL THE SHIP LANDS
TO COME UP

12:22.916 --> 12:25.092
WITH A QUIET WAY
TO GET CLARKE ON IT.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.703
WHAT ABOUT MURPHY
AND EMORI?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.357
FOR NOW,
WE TELL THEM NOTHING.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.750
EMORI, TOO?

12:30.793 --> 12:31.751
BELLAMY: WE HAVE TO ASSUME
THAT SHE'S WITH HIM.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.404
DON'T WORRY.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.015
WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO,
WE'RE TAKING THEM WITH US,

12:35.058 --> 12:38.801
EVEN IF WE HAVE
TO DO IT BY FORCE.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.899
-HEY...
-HMM.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.162
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
MORNING.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.730
COME ON OUTSIDE. I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.646
-DON'T DO THAT.
-DO WHAT?

12:57.689 --> 12:59.866
ACT LIKE
NOTHING'S WRONG.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.868
THEY KILLED CLARKE.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.392
HOW CAN YOU BE
OK WITH THAT?

13:04.435 --> 13:06.220
I'M NOT.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.222
LET ME GUESS.
YOU TALKED TO BELLAMY.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.181
ECHO. SHE SAID YOU
MADE A DEAL WITH THEM.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.096
WE DON'T GO TO WAR
OVER CLARKE,

13:13.140 --> 13:15.577
THE BUILD US
ANOTHER SANCTUM.

13:15.620 --> 13:20.582
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.544
ONLY IMMORTALITY.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.851
WHAT?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.070
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
WANTED TO DO THIS

13:30.113 --> 13:32.072
ON A BALCONY OVERLOOKING
OUR BRAND-NEW WORLD,

13:32.115 --> 13:36.728
BUT I GUESS IT IS
HAS TO BE HERE,

13:36.772 --> 13:40.558
IT HAS TO BE HERE.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.344
JOHN?

13:43.387 --> 13:45.868
WHAT IS THIS?

13:45.912 --> 13:48.392
EMORI, I LOVE YOU,

13:48.436 --> 13:51.221
AND--LOOK--I KNOW
I'VE NEVER BEEN PERFECT

13:51.265 --> 13:53.876
OR EVEN CLOSE,
FOR THAT MATTER,

13:53.920 --> 13:57.532
BUT YOU MAKE ME
WANT TO BE,

13:57.575 --> 14:01.753
AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SO MUCH AND SURVIVED SO MUCH.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.808
WHAT ARE THOSE?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.071
MIND DRIVES,

14:15.115 --> 14:17.857
ONE FOR EACH OF US.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.728
FIRST, THEY MAKE US
NIGHTBLOODS.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.948
THEN THEY
MAKE US PRIMES.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.994
WE'LL NEVER DIE.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.564
WELL, NOW, THAT'S
A SURVIVOR'S MOVE.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.305
OH, THE ULTIMATE.
HA HA!

14:34.961 --> 14:37.311
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:37.354 --> 14:41.010
THINK YOU CAN
LOVE ME FOREVER?

14:44.709 --> 14:46.929
JOSEPHINE: ADORABLE.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.497
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
WHERE'S RYKER?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.542
RYKER?

14:51.586 --> 14:54.415
RYKER,
GET DOWN HERE.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.548
JOSEPHINE, EMORI.
EMORI, JOSEPHINE.

14:57.592 --> 15:02.466
HELLO.

15:02.510 --> 15:05.339
BET YOU CAN'T WAIT TO
GET RID OF THAT THING.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.907
UH-UH-UH-UH,
HURRICANE JOSIE,

15:07.950 --> 15:10.518
YOU OWE HER
AN APOLOGY.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.521
RYKER!

15:15.436 --> 15:17.133
WHAT IS IT?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.701
-OR NOT.
-WHAT'S WRONG?

15:19.744 --> 15:21.355
NOT SURE WHERE
TO START.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.009
HOW ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE LIVING

15:23.052 --> 15:25.837
IN THE MACHINE SHOP
AND NOT THE PALACE?

15:25.881 --> 15:28.362
IT'S CLARKE,
RIGHT?

15:28.405 --> 15:30.059
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE ANSWER TO THAT

15:30.103 --> 15:32.583
IS NOT
A STRAIGHT UP NO.

15:32.627 --> 15:36.674
SORRY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT'S NOT A STRAIGHT UP NO?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.981
IS SHE WITH US?

15:39.025 --> 15:41.723
-I'M WITH YOU.
-GOOD.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.855
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

15:43.899 --> 15:45.814
BUT FIRST,
I NEED YOUR HELP

15:45.857 --> 15:50.819
GETTING YOUR FRIEND
OUT OF, WELL, HER OWN HEAD.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.173
JOSEPHINE?

15:57.217 --> 15:59.523
WELCOME TO THE PARTY.

15:59.567 --> 16:02.048
MURPHY: WAIT A MINUTE.
CLARKE'S ALIVE?

16:02.091 --> 16:05.225
GREAT. WE'RE ALL
ON THE SAME PAGE.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.924
WOW. I FEEL US
COMING TOGETHER

16:08.968 --> 16:13.015
AS A TEAM ALREADY,
DON'T YOU?

16:26.594 --> 16:29.989
HOW DO WE KNOW WHEN THIS STUFF
STARTS GETTING TO US?

16:30.032 --> 16:32.643
JOSEPHINE:
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY...

16:32.687 --> 16:35.472
DIYOZA: YOU OK THERE, GRANDPA?
I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.822
JOSEPHINE:
WHAT DO YOU THINK, GABRIEL?

16:37.866 --> 16:39.476
DIYOZA: ARE WE BORING YOU?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.088
HOW ABOUT WE PASS THE TIME
BY YOU TELLING US

16:42.131 --> 16:44.090
HOW SOMEONE DEDICATED
TO THE DESTRUCTION

16:44.133 --> 16:47.354
OF THE IMMORTAL PRIMES
TOOK A NEW BODY?

16:47.397 --> 16:49.269
I MEAN, DYING SUCKS--
I GET IT--

16:49.312 --> 16:51.271
BUT NOT BEING WILLING
TO DIE FOR YOUR CAUSE

16:51.314 --> 16:53.882
MAKES YOU A COWARD
WHERE I COME FROM.

16:53.925 --> 16:57.799
I LEFT SANCTUM, BUT
SANCTUM DIDN'T LEAVE ME.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.279
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

16:59.322 --> 17:01.063
IT MEANS I STILL HAVE
THE DRIVE IN MY HEAD

17:01.107 --> 17:03.239
BUT NO ONE
TO REMOVE IT.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.894
I EVENTUALLY TAUGHT
SOMEONE--EDUARDO,

17:05.937 --> 17:09.767
A NULL INFANT RESCUED
FROM THE OFFERING GROVE.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.466
I LOVED HIM
LIKE A SON.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.555
UNFORTUNATELY,
ONCE HE LEARNED

17:14.598 --> 17:16.861
TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE,
HE REFUSED.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.907
DIYOZA: WHY?

17:18.950 --> 17:22.041
BY THEN, XAVIER WAS BORN.
HE HAD THE BLOOD.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
EDUARDO BELIEVED
IT WAS A SIGN,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.045
A FREEBORN HOST.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.437
I THOUGHT I CONVINCED
HIM OTHERWISE,

17:27.481 --> 17:28.960
BUT WHEN MY LAST BODY
DIED, HE FINALLY

17:29.004 --> 17:31.441
WIPED XAVIER
AND BROUGHT ME BACK.

17:31.485 --> 17:35.184
JOSEPHINE: HE LOVED YOU
TOO MUCH TO LOSE YOU.

17:35.228 --> 17:40.102
I KNOW THE FEELING.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.712
ONCE I RESURRECTED

17:41.756 --> 17:44.237
AND REALIZED
WHAT HE DID,

17:44.280 --> 17:47.283
I KILLED HIM
IN A FIT OF RAGE

17:47.327 --> 17:50.112
AND ASSUMED XAVIER'S
IDENTITY OUT OF SHAME.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.071
NO ONE ELSE KNEW.

17:52.114 --> 17:55.378
THAT'S WHY THEY THINK
YOU ABANDONED THEM.

17:55.422 --> 17:59.730
THEY WERE RIGHT.
HE'S A COWARD.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.125
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

18:03.169 --> 18:05.910
GABRIEL: HEY, HEY.

18:05.954 --> 18:09.436
YOU DIDN'T
ABANDON YOUR PEOPLE.

18:09.479 --> 18:13.962
YOU WERE JUST AFRAID
TO LEAD THEM.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.530
I WAS TRYING TO
TAKE DOWN A SYSTEM

18:16.573 --> 18:19.098
DEDICATED TO THE WORSHIP
OF FALSE GODS.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.361
JOSEPHINE: A SYSTEM
YOU HELPED CREATE.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.799
I BECAME A FALSE GOD
ALL OVER AGAIN.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.409
UNDERSTAND?

18:27.497 --> 18:28.629
HMM.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.804
GOOD. COME ON.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.110
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH LONGER,

18:31.153 --> 18:33.242
AND WE STILL GOT
A WAYS TO GO.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.119
OHH!

18:40.162 --> 18:41.946
HEY. HEY, HEY.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.166
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FREAK OUT
ON MY AGAIN, ARE YOU?

18:44.210 --> 18:47.996
-OH...
-HEY, COME ON.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.607
COME ON.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.924
-WHAT?
-WHAT?

19:02.967 --> 19:04.665
NOTHING.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.797
IT'S JUST, UH,

19:06.841 --> 19:08.756
CAN SHE SEE ME, OR...

19:10.975 --> 19:13.935
YES. SHE CAN, JOHN,

19:13.978 --> 19:16.155
AND SHE KNOWS THAT
YOU BETRAYED HER

19:16.198 --> 19:17.808
AND THAT YOU'RE
GONNA HELP ME

19:17.852 --> 19:19.941
KILL HER ONCE
AND FOR ALL.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.986
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

19:22.030 --> 19:23.640
RYKER: SHE'S LYING.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.207
BY THE TIME BOTH MINDS
ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSCIOUS,

19:25.251 --> 19:28.079
SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO SPEAK,
LET ALONE STAND.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.169
JOSEPHINE: NOT QUITE RIGHT.

19:30.212 --> 19:34.216
IT DOES SUCK, THOUGH,
WHICH IS WHY IT ENDS TODAY.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.788
I KNOW WHY I'M DOING THIS.
WHY ARE YOU?

19:40.831 --> 19:43.617
JOSEPHINE: BECAUSE SHE WANTS
WHAT YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED.

19:43.660 --> 19:47.490
SHALL WE TELL HER
WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS?

19:47.534 --> 19:49.884
DIDN'T THINK SO.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.583
SO WHAT DO WE USE TO CHANNEL
THE PULSE TO HER BRAIN?

19:56.282 --> 19:59.850
WAIT.
THE WRISTBAND.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.635
I SAW IT
IN CLARKE'S MIND.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.289
THEY CLAMPED IT
ON RAVEN'S WRIST

20:03.332 --> 20:06.030
BEFORE BLASTING
HER WITH THE EMP.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.118
THE TELEMETRIC CUFFS
THEY USED

20:07.162 --> 20:08.903
TO MONITOR YOU
FROM THE ARK.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.297
IT MADE CONTACT WITH
THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.300
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT HERE.

20:14.343 --> 20:18.739
ACTUALLY, WE DO.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:21.872 --> 20:24.223
I LIKE YOU, EMORI.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.748
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
BE GREAT FRIENDS.

20:33.754 --> 20:36.931
HMM. I APPROVE.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.284
LET'S PREP
FOR SURGERY.

20:42.328 --> 20:45.940
ONE ELIGIUS SHOCK COLLAR.
WHAT DO YOU NEED IT FOR?

20:45.983 --> 20:47.637
THIS CIRCUITRY
WILL BE USEFUL

20:47.681 --> 20:50.901
IN BUILDING OUR
RADIATION SHIELD.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.393
YOU OK?

21:04.437 --> 21:07.266
MM.

21:07.309 --> 21:11.357
THANKS FOR THIS.
SEE YOU.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.497
BELLAMY...

21:26.023 --> 21:28.199
CLARKE'S ALIVE.

21:30.506 --> 21:34.336
YOU ALREADY KNEW.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

21:36.295 --> 21:39.863
OH, BECAUSE
I'M WITH JOHN.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.388
-EMORI, I--
-NEVER MIND.

21:42.431 --> 21:45.478
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ABOUT IT?

21:45.521 --> 21:47.349
YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TIME?

21:47.393 --> 21:51.179
BELLAMY, THEY'RE
WIPING HER TODAY.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.181
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS FOR.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.317
I TAKE IT
IT'S GO TIME.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.536
YEAH. WE NEED A PLAN
TO GET CLARKE NOW,

22:00.580 --> 22:02.973
SOMETHING OTHER
THAN KILLING THEM.

22:03.017 --> 22:05.411
WHERE THE HELL'S MADI?

22:15.899 --> 22:18.337
SORRY TO KEEP
YOU WAITING.

22:28.608 --> 22:31.959
FOR THE GLORY AND GRACE
OF THE PRIMES.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.068
OHH...

23:04.861 --> 23:06.341
IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE
TO BRING BACK

23:06.385 --> 23:12.216
SOMEONE YOU LOVE,
WOULD YOU?

23:12.260 --> 23:15.524
NOT IF I HAD TO KILL
SOMEONE TO DO IT.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.787
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO DEBATE THIS.

23:17.831 --> 23:20.616
NO. YOU CAME HERE TO ASK ME
TO TAKE A SPACEWALK

23:20.660 --> 23:23.445
BECAUSE BECCA'S SERUM
ONLY COMBINES IN ZERO G.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.142
IT'S WHAT WE FIGURED OUT
BEFORE YOU WENT

23:25.186 --> 23:27.101
FULL MOUNT WEATHER
ON LUNA,

23:27.144 --> 23:30.278
TURNING HER
INTO A MONSTER.

23:30.321 --> 23:33.542
NOW I GUESS
IT'S YOUR TURN.

23:33.586 --> 23:36.023
RAVEN, IF WE DON'T DO
THIS, MARCUS DIES, TOO.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.764
THEN THAT MAN
WHO SACRIFICED

23:37.807 --> 23:39.287
HIS LIFE
FOR HIM IS--

23:39.330 --> 23:40.680
OH, STOP.

23:40.723 --> 23:44.248
DO YOU HONESTLY THINK THIS
IS WHAT KANE WOULD WANT?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.860
I DON'T KNOW...

23:49.253 --> 23:52.126
BUT NO,
PROBABLY NOT.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.694
HE'LL HATE YOU
FOR IT.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.394
MAYBE.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.962
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.399
I MIGHT LOSE HIM,

24:04.443 --> 24:07.097
BUT AT LEAST HE GETS
A CHANCE TO LIVE.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.885
I AM NOT DOING
THIS FOR ME.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.322
NEITHER AM I.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.367
GET OUT.

24:16.411 --> 24:18.631
-RAVEN, PLEASE.
-I SAID GO.

24:18.674 --> 24:24.158
FINE. I'LL TAKE THE
SPACEWALK MYSELF.

24:24.201 --> 24:27.727
GO FOR IT.
MY SUIT'S IN THE CARGO BAY.

24:29.555 --> 24:32.775
AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE
A NICE VIEW WHEN YOU DIE.

24:38.433 --> 24:42.481
OH, BRAIN SURGERY
IN A MACHINE SHOP.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.395
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

24:44.439 --> 24:47.573
IT'S VERY CLARKE,
ACTUALLY.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.792
YEAH.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.013
HEY...

24:55.058 --> 24:57.147
YOU'LL BE
A GOD, JOHN.

24:57.191 --> 25:00.368
THEY'LL WRITE
SONGS ABOUT YOU.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.370
THEY'LL PRAY TO YOU.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.111
YOU'LL ONLY GET OLD
IF YOU WANT TO,

25:04.154 --> 25:06.200
AND YOU'LL
NEVER DIE.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.511
HOW ARE WE DOING
OVER THERE?

25:12.554 --> 25:15.470
YEAH. ALL SET,
ACTUALLY.

25:17.298 --> 25:19.039
JOSEPHINE:

25:19.082 --> 25:22.608
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
IN CASE ANYONE GETS ANY IDEAS...

25:24.392 --> 25:26.220
IF I DON'T COME BACK,

25:26.263 --> 25:29.049
JADE HAS A LETTER
FOR MY FATHER

25:29.092 --> 25:31.312
ABOUT HOW YOU
LET GABRIEL GO.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.488
THAT MAKES YOU A FOUNDER
OF THE TERRORISTS

25:33.532 --> 25:35.272
TRYING TO
WIPE US OUT.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.188
MY GUESS--YOU'LL GET
FED TO THE FOREST...

25:41.017 --> 25:42.802
-AND YOU...
-MM-HMM?

25:44.368 --> 25:47.197
IN CASE YOU HAVE
ANY SECOND THOUGHTS,

25:47.241 --> 25:49.199
SHE HAS ORDERS
TO KILL YOU

25:49.243 --> 25:52.202
AND YOUR ADORABLE--

25:55.815 --> 25:57.599
EMORI.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.082
SHE TOOK
THE EMP.

26:31.241 --> 26:34.070
EMORI, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

26:34.114 --> 26:37.726
LET'S GO BACK,
BE IMMORTALS.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.510
THE OFFER STILL STANDS
FOR THE NEXT 10 SECONDS.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.165
PLEASE, JUST LET ME
TALK TO HER, OK?

26:47.693 --> 26:49.477
I LOVE YOU.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.392
I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD,

26:51.435 --> 26:52.349
BUT CLARKE WAS WILLING
TO PUT YOU IN AN OVEN.

26:52.393 --> 26:54.613
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

26:54.656 --> 26:57.224
OH, JOHN,

26:57.267 --> 26:59.879
I AM SO SORRY IT HAD
TO BE LIKE THIS.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.316
LIKE WHAT?

27:02.359 --> 27:03.622
EMORI, NOTHING
NEEDS TO CHANGE.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.493
WE CAN GO BACK
RIGHT NOW.

27:05.536 --> 27:07.582
I TOLD THEM NOT TO TELL
THE GUARDS ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

27:10.367 --> 27:13.588
BELLAMY: THAT'S WHAT
WE WERE COUNTING ON.

27:15.938 --> 27:19.202
OH, PERFECT.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.335
YOU KNOW, I
ADMIRE YOU GUYS.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.250
I REALLY DO.

27:23.293 --> 27:25.426
IF THE OTHER PRIMES
HAD HALF YOUR BALLS,

27:25.469 --> 27:26.732
WE'D BE SWIMMING
IN HOSTS,

27:26.775 --> 27:28.255
AND NONE OF THIS
WOULD BE NECESSARY,

27:28.298 --> 27:30.387
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
IT IS,

27:30.431 --> 27:31.475
SO I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU THE FACTS

27:31.519 --> 27:33.086
BECAUSE I REALLY
DON'T THINK

27:33.129 --> 27:34.304
YOU THOUGHT
THIS THROUGH.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.566
YES, CLARKE'S ALIVE,
BUT THE BRAIN

27:35.610 --> 27:37.525
WE NOW SHARE
IS DYING,

27:37.568 --> 27:39.788
SO UNLESS ONE OF YOU
IS A NEUROSURGEON,

27:39.832 --> 27:43.270
THIS BODY WILL DIE
IN HOURS, NOT DAYS.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.185
MY MIND WILL
BE BACKED UP,
AND HERS WON'T.

27:45.228 --> 27:48.928
ECHO: ACTUALLY,
OUR NEUROSURGEON'S ON HIS WAY.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.976
JACKSON.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.762
HUH. OK.
SURE.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.633
LET'S SAY THAT HE
FIGURES IT OUT.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.679
HE WON'T, BUT,
JUST FOR FUN,

28:00.722 --> 28:02.202
WHERE YOU
GONNA OPERATE,

28:02.245 --> 28:03.812
HERE IN
A JOBERRY FIELD?

28:03.856 --> 28:05.466
BELLAMY: ACTUALLY, WE'RE
THINKING ABOUT USING

28:05.509 --> 28:07.381
ONE OF THE 14
RESEARCH OUTPOSTS

28:07.424 --> 28:09.339
MARKED ON THE MAP
YOUR FATHER GAVE US.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.559
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU CAN'T GET PAST

28:11.602 --> 28:13.343
THE RADIATION
SHIELD.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.694
OH, THAT'S WHERE
THE EMP COMES IN.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.308
EMORI...

28:21.351 --> 28:23.310
-UH UH!
-AH! UH!

28:23.353 --> 28:25.399
-ALL RIGHT.
-I'M SORRY, JOHN.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.707
STEP AWAY FROM
THE DEVICE.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.014
BELLAMY: YOU THINK WE
CARE ABOUT THAT TRAITOR?

28:32.058 --> 28:34.277
JOSEPHINE: UH, LORD KNOWS
YOU SHOULDN'T,

28:34.321 --> 28:36.018
BUT, YEAH, I DO,
WHICH BRINGS US

28:36.062 --> 28:39.456
TO YET ANOTHER EPISODE
OF "NO GOOD CHOICES."

28:39.500 --> 28:41.328
CLARKE WOULD LOVE THIS.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.287
EITHER YOU LET MURPHY DIE
IN A DOOMED ATTEMPT TO SAVE HER,

28:44.331 --> 28:46.333
STARTING A WAR
WITH MY FATHER

28:46.376 --> 28:50.337
OR WE STAY FRIENDS AND LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.906
TAKE A MINUTE
TO THINK IT OVER.

29:01.391 --> 29:02.784
MADI?

29:02.828 --> 29:04.177
NOT ON ANY OF
THE LOWER LEVELS.

29:04.220 --> 29:05.395
WHERE'S JORDAN?

29:05.439 --> 29:06.701
I THOUGHT
HE WAS WITH YOU.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.615
NO. WE SPLIT UP
TO COVER MORE GROUND.

29:07.658 --> 29:08.747
I'LL FIND HIM, TOO,

29:08.790 --> 29:10.009
BUT YOU NEED
TO GO NOW.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.533
WHAT? NO. I'M NOT
LEAVING WITHOUT YOU.

29:12.576 --> 29:17.146
MAN: MIRANDA PRIME
IS DEAD!

29:17.190 --> 29:19.583
THE CHILDREN OF GABRIEL
ARE HERE.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.456
-OH, HOW COULD THAT BE?
-NO.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.806
-IT'S MADI'S PLAN.
-SHE'S IN THE GREAT HALL.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.677
JACKSON: WE GOT TO FIND HER
BEFORE SHE KILLS SOMEONE ELSE.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.331
CASSIUS: THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL ARE HERE.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.420
LET US GET YOU
INSIDE.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.987
IT WASN'T THE
CHILDREN OF GABRIEL.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.423
BRING ME THE PEOPLE
FROM EARTH.

29:33.467 --> 29:34.424
GET PRIYA AND RYKER
INTO THE GREAT HALL

29:34.468 --> 29:36.035
AND SOUND THE ALARM.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.733
CASSIUS: SOUND THE ALARM
RIGHT NOW!

29:38.777 --> 29:40.474
WHERE THE HELL
IS JOSEPHINE?

29:45.218 --> 29:48.134
HUH. THAT CAN'T
BE GOOD FOR YOU.

29:48.177 --> 29:53.052
STAND DOWN NOW,
AND THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.097
WE CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT JACKSON.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.317
MURPHY: YOU
DON'T NEED HIM.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.492
FIND GABRIEL.

29:58.535 --> 29:59.580
HE WAS ONE OF THEM,
BUT THEN HE BAILED.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.016
RYKER HELPED
HIM ESCAPE.

30:01.060 --> 30:03.192
GABRIEL LEFT
70 YEARS AGO.

30:03.236 --> 30:07.022
HE'D BE 106 BY NOW,
ALSO KNOWN AS DEAD.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.676
WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO CONCERNED?

30:10.809 --> 30:14.073
JOSEPHINE:
HERE THEY COME.

30:18.381 --> 30:21.210
SET THE EMP.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.561
JOSEPHINE: SO MUCH
FOR FOREVER.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.826
-AAGH!
-NO! JOHN!

30:27.869 --> 30:31.481
-NO.
-OH! JOHN! JOHN...

30:31.525 --> 30:34.354
-UH!
-UGH! AGH! UHH...

30:34.397 --> 30:35.877
EMORI: JUST PUT IT
NEAR THE PYLON,

30:35.921 --> 30:37.705
PLUG IT IN, AND
PRESS THE BUTTON.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.533
MAKE SURE CLARKE
IS OUT OF THE WAY.

30:39.576 --> 30:40.621
YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS
TO GET OUT

30:40.664 --> 30:41.622
BEFORE IT REBOOTS.

30:41.665 --> 30:42.841
YOU TAKE CLARKE.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.233
I'LL STAY AND KEEP
THE OTHERS SAFE.

30:44.277 --> 30:47.323
WHEN THE SHIP GETS BACK,
WE'LL FIND YOU.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.282
THIS IS A REALLY
STUPID PLAN, YOU KNOW.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.893
IF YOU DO THIS, THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL WILL KILL US BOTH,

30:51.937 --> 30:53.939
AND MY FATHER WILL
KILL THE REST OF YOU.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.942
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

30:58.944 --> 31:02.469
-WE GOT THIS.
-YOU SO DON'T.

31:04.384 --> 31:07.126
ECHO: IT'S DOWN. GO NOW.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.302
UH!

31:22.663 --> 31:24.447
STAY SAFE.

31:24.491 --> 31:27.059
SAVE CLARKE.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.974
HUH! UH!

31:29.017 --> 31:31.454
-OK.
-EMORI, COME ON.

31:31.498 --> 31:32.499
HE'S WITH THEM NOW.

31:32.542 --> 31:33.935
NO. I'M STAYING
WITH HIM.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.155
GO FIND
OUR FRIENDS.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.461
OK. OK.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.333
YOU HAVE TO GO.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.639
SHUT UP, JOHN.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.946
MY ANSWER'S YES.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.470
I WILL LOVE YOU
FOREVER,

31:47.514 --> 31:50.430
EVEN IF
WE DIE TODAY.

31:52.388 --> 31:53.868
STAY WITH ME.
JOHN!

31:56.653 --> 31:57.785
EVERYONE OUT.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.526
PRIME PROTECTION PROTOCOL
IN EFFECT.

31:59.569 --> 32:02.964
-MOVE OUT.
-LET'S GO.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.717
-NO!
-AAH!

32:16.760 --> 32:19.024
-NO.
-JORDAN?

32:19.067 --> 32:20.590
CASSIUS: LOCK THE CHILD UP
WITH THE OTHERS

32:20.634 --> 32:22.157
AND CALL THE DOCTORS.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.637
-I'LL STAY WITH PRIYA. MOVE!
-LET ME THROUGH!

32:23.680 --> 32:25.552
JACKSON: I'M A DOCTOR!

32:38.826 --> 32:40.001
BE CAREFUL
WITH THAT.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.047
I CAN'T MAKE
ANOTHER BATCH.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.874
SORRY.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.792
DID YOU PREBREATHE PURE
O2 BEFORE SUITING UP?

32:48.836 --> 32:50.664
IF NOT, THE NITROGEN
IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM

32:50.707 --> 32:52.448
COULD KILL YOU.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.494
I'LL DO THAT NOW.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.368
TAKE OFF
THE SUIT, ABBY.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.066
RAVEN,
I'M DOING THIS.

33:01.109 --> 33:04.112
RAVEN:
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

33:04.156 --> 33:05.809
I AM.

33:05.853 --> 33:08.029
YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.771
AN INNOCENT MAN IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.468
THE WAY I SEE IT,
LETTING YOU DIE, TOO,

33:12.512 --> 33:14.688
WOULD ONLY
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.519
I COULDN'T SAVE
MY MOTHER,

33:19.562 --> 33:22.522
BUT I CAN SAVE YOU.

33:22.565 --> 33:27.266
NOW TAKE OFF THE DAMN SUIT
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.751
JOSEPHINE: COME ON. SPEAK.

33:34.795 --> 33:37.754
WE BOTH KNOW YOU ONLY
COME HERE TO SEE ME.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.408
NOT THIS TIME.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.757
YOU SAY
SOMETHING, DOC?

33:40.801 --> 33:42.977
NO. YOU MUST BE
HEARING THINGS.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.675
THE ANOMALY
WILL DO THAT.

33:45.719 --> 33:48.026
SOMETIMES IT'S
YOUR DARKEST FEAR...

33:48.983 --> 33:51.942
SOMETIMES YOUR
DEEPEST DESIRE.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.339
SOMETIMES IT'S
BOTH AT ONCE.

34:07.523 --> 34:11.136
GIRL: MOMMY! MOMMY!

34:11.179 --> 34:13.486
HOPE.

34:13.529 --> 34:16.532
MOMMY, PLEASE HELP!

34:18.708 --> 34:20.101
HELP!

34:20.145 --> 34:22.408
JOSEPHINE: HER CHILD.
OF COURSE.

34:22.451 --> 34:26.934
PRIMAL, TOUGH TO RESIST.
10 TO ONE, SHE GOES IN.

34:26.977 --> 34:29.763
YOU MAY FINALLY GET
YOUR ANSWERS, GABRIEL.

34:31.982 --> 34:33.723
GABRIEL: LONG IS
THE WAY AND HARD

34:33.767 --> 34:35.508
THAT OUT OF HELL
LEADS UP TO LIGHT.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.926
WOW.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.975
GABRIEL: WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.630
NO ONE'S WHO'S GONE IN
HAS EVER COME OUT.

35:12.762 --> 35:16.766
WAIT.
SHE'S NOT THERE.

35:20.944 --> 35:24.165
OCTAVIA: WHATEVER YOU SEE,
IT ISN'T REAL.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.603
IF YOU GO IN THERE,
YOU'LL DIE.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.562
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS

35:29.605 --> 35:31.651
OR IF IT'S REAL.

35:31.694 --> 35:33.870
I JUST KNOW
I HAVE TO GO.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.837
OH...

35:48.363 --> 35:51.323
NO.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.716
DIYOZA! WAIT!

36:06.251 --> 36:07.948
HUH!

36:17.479 --> 36:20.395
YOU'RE HEALED. OH...

36:31.189 --> 36:34.235
RUSSELL:
5 DEAD PRIMES IN 5 DAYS.

36:34.279 --> 36:37.325
THIS IS MY FAULT
FOR LETTING THEM STAY.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.849
OH, I'M SURE YOU
HAD YOUR REASONS.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.938
THEY'RE NOT ALL BAD,
RUSSELL.

36:41.982 --> 36:45.768
DELILAH'S BOYFRIEND
SAVED MY LIFE.

36:45.812 --> 36:49.685
AND FOR THAT, WE'LL DO
WHAT WE CAN TO SAVE HIS,

36:49.729 --> 36:51.600
BUT THE OTHERS
WILL STAND TRIAL

36:51.644 --> 36:53.211
FOR WHAT
THEY'VE DONE.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.561
TRIAL?

36:55.604 --> 36:58.564
HUH. GOOD.

36:58.607 --> 37:01.523
WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THEIR MOTIVE.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.396
WHAT MOTIVE COULD
POSSIBLY EXPLAIN--

37:04.439 --> 37:06.702
MOTHER, PLEASE.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.879
ZEUS LOOKS LIKE HE
HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.754
SHE CAME TO YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

37:14.797 --> 37:17.452
YES. SHE DID.

37:19.193 --> 37:21.630
SHE WHO?

37:23.328 --> 37:24.894
JOSEPHINE.

37:29.464 --> 37:33.512
THE ONE WITH THE BLOOD--
CLARKE.

37:36.384 --> 37:39.431
RUSSELL AND SIMONE
MURDERED HER...

37:42.260 --> 37:44.653
ONLY IT DIDN'T
QUITE TAKE, DID IT?

37:44.697 --> 37:49.615
RUSSELL, IT WASN'T
YOUR TURN.

37:49.658 --> 37:51.704
YOU JUMPED THE LINE.

37:51.747 --> 37:53.140
MAN: MOVE.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.839
RUSSELL:
WHERE IS SHE?

37:56.883 --> 37:59.494
THEY GOT THROUGH
THE SHIELD MOVING EAST

37:59.538 --> 38:03.455
TOWARD CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL TERRITORY.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.587
UHH...

38:11.376 --> 38:14.030
HOW MANY ARE
WITH JOSEPHINE?

38:14.074 --> 38:17.817
JADE: THEY'RE NOT
TALKING, SIR.

38:17.860 --> 38:21.037
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

38:21.081 --> 38:23.823
PUT THEM
WITH THE OTHERS.

38:23.866 --> 38:25.564
AAGH!

38:25.607 --> 38:26.956
UH...

38:27.000 --> 38:30.133
RRGH! RRGH!

38:30.177 --> 38:32.135
UGH!

38:40.405 --> 38:42.276
GET THEIR GUNS.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.191
DISTRIBUTE THEM
TO THE GUARDS.

38:44.234 --> 38:47.281
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO BRING MY DAUGHTER HOME.

38:51.851 --> 38:55.289
AS THE PRIMES ARE MY WITNESS,
I'LL BRING THEM BACK.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.479
HERE HE COMES.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.670
I'LL LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.541
ABBY.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.546
MARCUS?

40:20.548 --> 40:23.159
HUH. OHH...

40:42.178 --> 40:45.834
WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING?

41:00.632 --> 41:02.808
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

41:08.901 --> 41:11.338
I SAVED YOU.
