14:31.071 --> 14:32.139
>> COOL, YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.140
SO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?

14:33.140 --> 14:34.207
>> A LOT.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.142
I WORK FOR MY FATHER NOW.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.376
SO I'M THE DIRECTOR OF

14:36.376 --> 14:37.277
COMMUNICATIONS OVER AT THE

14:37.277 --> 14:38.311
ATLANTA DUNKS.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.512
BUT DON'T LET THE TITLE FOOL

14:39.512 --> 14:40.380
YOU.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.448
I STILL LIKE TO PARTY HARD.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.682
>> [laughs] GOOD TO KNOW.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.917
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN MIX SOME

14:43.917 --> 14:44.952
BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE BECAUSE

14:44.952 --> 14:45.452
I'M A PROMOTER.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.153
>> NO!

14:46.153 --> 14:47.054
>> YEAH, SO WE CAN GET YOUR

14:47.054 --> 14:47.587
PLAYERS TO COME AND MAKE

14:47.587 --> 14:49.156
APPEARANCES AT THE CLUBS I HOST.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.023
>> SURE, WHATEVER.

14:50.023 --> 14:50.557
JUST LET ME KNOW.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.159
>> SO I THINK THAT GUY OVER

14:52.159 --> 14:53.160
THERE IS FEELING YOU.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.094
HE'S BEEN CHECKING YOU OUT THIS

14:54.094 --> 14:56.129
ENTIRE TIME WE'VE BEEN TALKING.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.430
>> THAT'S JAMES.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.932
HE'S MY BOO.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.500
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR TEN

15:00.500 --> 15:01.935
MONTHS NOW.

15:01.935 --> 15:02.936
AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE HE DOES

15:02.936 --> 15:04.037
NOT PLAY PRO BALL?

15:04.037 --> 15:04.938
>> OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A

15:04.938 --> 15:05.939
REQUIREMENT.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.174
>> GIRL, PLEASE, ATHLETE IS A

15:07.174 --> 15:08.241
BONUS.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.142
USUALLY I'M ATTRACTED TO BAD

15:09.142 --> 15:10.443
BOYS, BUT JAMES IS SQUEAKY

15:10.443 --> 15:11.411
CLEAN.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.012
IT TRIPS ME OUT HOW CRAZY I AM

15:12.012 --> 15:13.046
ABOUT HIM.

15:13.046 --> 15:13.981
>> WHAT DOES HE DO?

15:13.981 --> 15:14.647
>> HE'S TRYING TO BE THE NEXT

15:14.647 --> 15:15.515
BARACK.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.717
>> OH, MY GOD! SHELLY!

15:17.717 --> 15:18.551
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE DATING

15:18.551 --> 15:19.319
JAMES.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.453
YOU KNOW, HE USED TO LIVE TWO

15:20.453 --> 15:21.688
BLOCKS OVER FROM ME.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.323
HOW'S YOUR SISTER?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.191
>> SHE'S GREAT.

15:24.191 --> 15:24.657
>> HEY.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.325
>> YOU KNOW KENNEDY.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.193
>> BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.

15:26.193 --> 15:26.793
>> SHE'S GOT, LIKE, FOUR KIDS

15:26.793 --> 15:27.427
NOW.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.395
>> NO WONDER SHE HASN'T CALLED

15:28.395 --> 15:29.196
ME.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.163
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

15:30.163 --> 15:30.797
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE IN COLLEGE

15:30.797 --> 15:31.664
WHO WANTED HER OWN LITTLE SOCCER

15:31.664 --> 15:33.366
TEAM.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.334
>> HI, HOW ARE YOU?

15:34.334 --> 15:35.468
I'M JAMES BLACKWELL.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.203
>> HI, I'M APRIL.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.204
NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.238
>> YOU TOO.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.139
WELL, I HATE TO STEAL THIS

15:39.139 --> 15:40.473
PRETTY LADY AWAY, BUT I HAVE TO

15:40.473 --> 15:42.042
INTRODUCE HER TO MY BROTHERS

15:42.042 --> 15:43.210
AND A FEW COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.111
>> AND THAT IS WHY I BROUGHT MY

15:44.111 --> 15:45.979
HAND SANITIZER.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.347
I'M GONNA GO GET MY MICHELLE ON.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.049
ALWAYS SO GOOD SEEING YOU.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.583
>> GOOD SEEING YOU.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.751
>> APRIL, BEFORE YOU LEAVE,

15:51.751 --> 15:52.619
MAKE SURE YOU GET MY NUMBER.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.353
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.254
>> OKAY, SEE YOU.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.022
>> BYE.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.991
>> NICE MEETING YOU.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.299
>> BRACE YOURSELF, RAQUEL.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.234
HERE COMES YOUR EX.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.435
>> YOU'VE GOT THIS, GIRL.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.404
COOL AS ICE.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.443
>> RAQUEL.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.411
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.681
>> I AM WELL, VICTOR, THANK YOU.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.316
>> SO HOW'S IT BEEN GOING?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.217
I'VE HEARD YOU'VE BEEN DOING

16:24.217 --> 16:24.851
SOME DIFFERENT THINGS WITH YOUR

16:24.851 --> 16:25.518
CAREER NOW.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.021
>> YEAH, CHANGE IS GOOD.

16:28.021 --> 16:28.721
>> SO HAVE YOU FOUND THE MAN OF

16:28.721 --> 16:30.390
YOUR DREAMS YET?

16:30.390 --> 16:33.260
>> NO.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.261
DOES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?

16:34.261 --> 16:35.262
>> I'D LIKE TO THINK IT WOULD

16:35.262 --> 16:36.096
TAKE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF

16:36.096 --> 16:37.030
MONTHS TO ERASE ALL OF OUR YEARS

16:37.030 --> 16:38.265
TOGETHER, SO YEAH.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.166
>> VICTOR, WE'VE KNOWN EACH

16:39.166 --> 16:40.667
OTHER ALL OF OUR LIVES.

16:40.667 --> 16:41.801
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO ERASE

16:41.801 --> 16:43.070
YOU.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.337
BUT ONCE THE DUST SETTLES, WHO

16:44.337 --> 16:45.338
KNOWS?

16:45.338 --> 16:46.273
THERE MIGHT BE A CHANCE FOR US

16:46.273 --> 16:47.174
TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.808
>> WELL, I HOPE SO.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.543
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN REELING SINCE

16:50.543 --> 16:51.511
WE BROKE UP.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.113
I KNOW WE HAD OUR PROBLEMS,

16:53.113 --> 16:54.747
BUT...

16:54.747 --> 16:57.584
YOU REALLY TORE MY HEART OUT.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.352
>> I'M SORRY IT'S BEEN TOUGH ON

16:59.352 --> 17:01.254
YOU.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.624
>> BABE.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.060
HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE STAYING?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.695
>> [scoffs] WOW.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.497
REALLY, VICTOR?

17:10.497 --> 17:12.299
TO THINK THERE WAS A TINY PART

17:12.299 --> 17:14.401
OF ME THAT WAS FEELING BAD AND

17:14.401 --> 17:16.403
ACTUALLY MISSED OUR FRIENDSHIP.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.206
JUST GO. [scoffs]

17:22.575 --> 17:25.278
>> MY GIRL, THAT'S EXACTLY HOW

17:25.278 --> 17:25.845
YOU HANDLE THEM.

17:25.845 --> 17:26.746
I MEAN, YOU SOFTENED A LITTLE

17:26.746 --> 17:28.315
TOO MUCH FOR MY TASTE IN THE

17:28.315 --> 17:29.782
MIDDLE, BUT YOU GOT YOURS IN THE

17:29.782 --> 17:30.483
END.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.086
NEVER LET YOUR EX SEE YOU SWEAT.

17:33.086 --> 17:33.620
>> MM-MM.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.754
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

17:34.754 --> 17:37.690
KAPPA BOULE'S ATLANTA CHAPTER

FRANKS.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.375
[applause]

18:01.414 --> 18:02.415
[The Four Tops'

18:02.415 --> 18:03.416
When She Was My Girl]

18:03.416 --> 18:05.352
>> * SHE USED TO BE

18:05.352 --> 18:09.322
* EVERYTHING TO ME

18:12.425 --> 18:14.627
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

18:14.627 --> 18:17.397
>> YES. YES. [scoffs]

18:17.397 --> 18:18.865
MALCOLM AND I BROKE UP TWO

18:18.865 --> 18:19.632
MONTHS AGO.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.268
WE'VE BOTH MOVED ON.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.503
IN FACT, I'M GOING TO MINGLE

18:23.503 --> 18:25.505
RIGHT NOW.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.440
OH, I SEE A CUTE GUY I WANT TO

18:27.440 --> 18:30.410
MEET.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.481
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN STARING SO

18:34.481 --> 18:36.383
HARD, I THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU A

18:36.383 --> 18:37.317
CLOSE-UP.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.385
>> [chuckles] I'M SORRY.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.352
I HOPE I DIDN'T COME ACROSS AS

18:39.352 --> 18:40.220
BEING RUDE.

18:40.220 --> 18:40.920
I FEEL LIKE I'VE SEEN YOU

18:40.920 --> 18:41.721
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.622
AND I SWEAR THAT'S NOT A PICKUP

18:42.622 --> 18:43.490
LINE.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.158
>> [laughs] DO YOU WORK OUT AT

18:45.158 --> 18:45.692
BALLY'S?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.294
>> NO, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU HAD

18:47.294 --> 18:48.161
COME INTO MY BANK.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.529
>> OH, YOU WORK OVER AT

18:49.529 --> 18:51.431
CITIZENS TRUST.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.532
>> YOU COULD SAY THAT I WORK

18:52.532 --> 18:53.333
THERE.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.567
BUT ACTUALLY MY FAMILY OWNS IT.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.568
I'M RANDALL SMITH.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.536
>> KEISHA GREENE.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.504
AND WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE

18:57.504 --> 18:58.638
LONG LINES AND A FEW OTHER

18:58.638 --> 18:59.706
THINGS AT YOUR BANK.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.341
YOU GOT A PEN?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.410
>> SURE.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.677
>> * FINGERPRINTS

19:04.677 --> 19:05.878
* ON MY HEART

19:05.878 --> 19:08.581
* OH, I FOUND THAT

19:08.581 --> 19:11.418
* YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE

19:11.418 --> 19:13.420
* OH-OH-OH

19:13.420 --> 19:14.687
* JUST LIKE A SERIAL KILLER

19:14.687 --> 19:16.189
>> HEY!

19:16.189 --> 19:17.424
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WAY OVER

19:17.424 --> 19:18.658
HERE?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.560
>> YOU KNOW, EXCEPT FOR YOUR

19:20.560 --> 19:22.462
PARENTS, THESE SOCIETY PEOPLE

19:22.462 --> 19:23.530
ARE REALLY SNOBBY AND

19:23.530 --> 19:24.497
STANDOFFISH.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.766
>> YES, A LOT OF THEM ARE.

19:26.766 --> 19:27.867
I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT HAVING A

19:27.867 --> 19:28.568
GOOD TIME.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.536
>> AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A

19:29.536 --> 19:30.537
RACIAL THING, BUT EVEN THE WHITE

19:30.537 --> 19:31.971
PEOPLE SCOOTED AWAY FROM ME LIKE

19:31.971 --> 19:32.872
I'M CONTAGIOUS.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.307
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.508
I'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF COLD

19:35.508 --> 19:36.709
SHOULDERS MYSELF TONIGHT.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.477
>> BUT WHY?

19:37.477 --> 19:38.478
YOUR BLOOD IS JUST AS BLUE AS

19:38.478 --> 19:38.945
THEIRS.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.480
>> YEAH.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.914
BUT I DARED TO PUBLICLY BREAK UP

19:41.914 --> 19:43.250
WITH ONE OF OUR OWN--

19:43.250 --> 19:45.552
DR. VICTOR BARRINGTON.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.254
IT IS SHOCKING HOW UPSET SOME

19:47.254 --> 19:47.920
PEOPLE ARE.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.389
IT'S LIKE THEY SEE IT AS AN ACT

19:49.389 --> 19:50.590
OF REBELLION AGAINST THEIR VERY

19:50.590 --> 19:51.524
WAY OF LIFE.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.494
>> WASN'T IT?

20:00.267 --> 20:00.700
>> [laughs]

20:00.700 --> 20:02.302
AND I HAVE ANOTHER BONE TO

20:02.302 --> 20:03.470
PICK WITH YOU, RANDALL.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.937
YOU GUYS HAVE TO EASE UP ON YOUR

20:04.937 --> 20:06.273
LENDING CRITERIA.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.340
YOU'RE LETTING A LOT OF BUSINESS

20:07.340 --> 20:07.940
GET AWAY FROM YOU.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.808
>> WELL, WE GOT SINGED PRETTY

20:08.808 --> 20:09.742
BAD IN THE MELTDOWN.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.810
GONNA TAKE A WHILE BEFORE WE

20:10.810 --> 20:11.911
FIND OUR WAY.

20:11.911 --> 20:12.879
BUT NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TROUBLE,

20:12.879 --> 20:14.281
ASK FOR ME.

20:14.281 --> 20:14.881
>> OH, WELL, LET ME HAVE YOUR

20:14.881 --> 20:15.782
CARD.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.650
MAYBE I CAN STEER SOME CUSTOMERS

20:17.650 --> 20:18.518
YOUR WAY, AND YOU CAN STEER SOME

20:18.518 --> 20:19.286
MINE.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.620
>> IF WE DON'T HELP EACH OTHER,

20:20.620 --> 20:21.488
WHO WILL?

20:21.488 --> 20:24.391
>> THANK YOU.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.294
>> KEISHA.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.461
HEY.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.430
>> HEY.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.334
>> HOW DO YOU TWO KNOW EACH

20:34.334 --> 20:35.268
OTHER?

20:35.268 --> 20:36.736
>> UM, KEISHA'S MY

20:36.736 --> 20:38.438
EX-GIRLFRIEND.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.541
>> OH, HOW FUN! [giggles]

20:41.541 --> 20:43.042
KEISHA, WILL YOU BE MAKING A

20:43.042 --> 20:43.910
DONATION TO THE BOULE

20:43.910 --> 20:45.345
FOUNDATION?

20:45.345 --> 20:46.846
THE USUAL PLEDGE IS $10,000.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.382
BUT ANY AMOUNT, NO MATTER HOW

20:49.382 --> 20:50.717
TINY, IS APPRECIATED.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.885
>> OH, IN THAT CASE, PUT ME DOWN

20:52.885 --> 20:54.487
FOR $15,000.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.522
>> WHOA.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.589
>> REALLY?

20:56.589 --> 20:59.559
>> REALLY.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.032
[upbeat music]

21:06.032 --> 21:12.405
