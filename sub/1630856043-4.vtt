WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:03.545
Now I done stayed in
some fucked up places before,

00:03.628 --> 00:05.880
but this by far takes the cake.

00:05.964 --> 00:08.675
Bruh, you got us staying in
the hotel MLK got shot at.

00:08.758 --> 00:09.676
The fuck is that smell?

00:09.759 --> 00:11.803
This gotta be the nastiest
place in Oakland.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.014
What the fuck is this,
left behind dick lotion?

00:14.556 --> 00:15.682
No, don't touch it.

00:15.765 --> 00:16.766
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.851
They didn't even clean this bitch.

00:18.893 --> 00:19.894
It's in my mouth.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.190
Get up! Get up!
Please. Oh, my God.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.485
Man, I can deal with some dust, nigga.
I can even fuck with some roaches,

00:27.569 --> 00:29.988
but what the fuck is this shit?

00:30.071 --> 00:31.031
That's nasty as fuck.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.742
Bruh, please tell me you don't know
this where they got us?

00:33.825 --> 00:34.743
Please.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.038
Shit! Oh, shit!

00:38.121 --> 00:40.040
R.I.P.! R.I.P.!

00:40.123 --> 00:41.583
Yeah, mud, I'm still clean

00:41.666 --> 00:43.209
And I came from the mud

01:02.187 --> 01:03.355
You got the Wi-Fi?

01:03.438 --> 01:06.232
Weak-ass,
raggedy-ass passcode ain't working.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.651
No. I don't believe this place
actually has Wi-Fi.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.363
But I got connected on my phone
to the Burger King next door.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.447
Here. Let me hook you up.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.533
Here you go.
Have it your way.

01:22.414 --> 01:24.292
Okay. I know you don't fuck with me.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.335
Girl

01:26.711 --> 01:28.963
I fuck with you, okay?

01:30.006 --> 01:32.217
You just aggravating sometimes,
you know that.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.051
I know that. I do know that.

01:34.134 --> 01:37.597
Besides, it's too dirty in this bitch
to be holding grudges, so.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.890
Yeah, I feel like we are
actually in the trenches.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.602
Now we can say
we got out the mud together,

01:42.686 --> 01:43.812
you know?

01:43.895 --> 01:45.021
Definitely accurate.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.190
Damn.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.777
I was just in Atlanta
with Ca$h Chaser the GOAT,

01:50.860 --> 01:54.239
living a life of luxury.
I'm talking about, bitch, everything.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.700
I done went from bidets to...

01:56.783 --> 01:58.451
-Bi-don'ts.
-Bi-fucking-don'ts.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.411
Bi-don'ts.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.871
Okay, so he flew you out,
and then what happened?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.249
I think I fumbled that shit.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.167
I accidentally sent him this.

02:08.086 --> 02:08.961
I know.

02:09.044 --> 02:12.007
Oh, damn.
Okay, he hasn't responded.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.049
Not all day.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.426
-Now I'm anxious.
-Shit.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.803
So in relationships, there can be,

02:16.886 --> 02:19.556
like, avoidant people,
and there can be anxious people.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.685
And it sounds like he's being avoidant.
And it's making you anxious.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.062
You know? So I just think that
you need to just chill.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.313
He knows what he's doing.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.275
Francois ain't answer.
But it's cool.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.277
I'ma holler at him
when we get to the hotel.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.695
Y'all just get dressed here.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.780
But don't unpack shit,
'cause we ain't sleeping here.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.823
Okay.

02:36.906 --> 02:37.781
Alright.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.829
-Oh, shit.
-What?

02:42.912 --> 02:45.665
Reina got a feature on "Complex".

02:46.374 --> 02:47.292
What?

02:47.876 --> 02:48.918
Pretty cool.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.005
"Tongue" remix is killing it right now.

02:52.088 --> 02:53.798
Congratulations on that song's success.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.924
Periodt. Scream that.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.677
But you got two new artists on there.
How'd you get connected with them?

02:57.761 --> 02:59.971
Well, first of all,
Shout out to Francois Boom.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.766
Okay? For creating
such a fire motherfucking track.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.225
-What are their names again?
-Oh, you know,

03:04.309 --> 03:05.602
they're just some local talent.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.687
You know? Some artists that I found.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.565
I just wanted to give them a shot.
Support women.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.905
She ain't even tag us,
mention us, or nothing?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.824
I've never heard her say our name.
Does she know our names?

03:19.908 --> 03:22.369
Man, fuck her. Fuck her.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.579
Y'all got to think of it
like mac and cheese.

03:25.079 --> 03:25.997
Why?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.041
Because I'm hungry and I miss home.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.542
Hear me out, though.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.295
Y'all like the mac and cheese
my grandmama used to make.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.838
Five cheese blend

03:34.214 --> 03:36.091
perfectly thick noodles,

03:36.174 --> 03:39.010
sprinkle the cheese on top,
throw that bitch in the oven

03:39.094 --> 03:41.471
it come out all gooey and crispy and shit.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.098
-Chastity, what the hell?
-Yeah.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.683
Stay with me now, alright?

03:44.766 --> 03:45.892
-I'm trying.
-Now Reina,

03:46.351 --> 03:47.852
she that blue box Kraft shit.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.814
Put a little water in that hoe,
throw the bitch in the microwave,

03:50.897 --> 03:52.107
and it's talking 'bout it's ready.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.276
Yeah,
some childish niggas gonna like that.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.987
But niggas with taste, real taste,

03:58.488 --> 03:59.739
they going to know the difference.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.200
-You might have a point.
-Yeah.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.202
-Y'all that ooey-gooey.
-And speaking of taste,

04:04.285 --> 04:06.079
I got some cute shit in my bag.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.331
-Yeah, get ready.
-Now, move over, roaches! I'm coming in.

04:09.874 --> 04:10.875
I need a hot boy

04:10.959 --> 04:11.835
Six foot with six figures

04:11.918 --> 04:12.794
And a big toy

04:12.877 --> 04:13.753
Heard he movin weight...

04:13.837 --> 04:15.630
Welcome, ladies.

04:15.714 --> 04:16.839
Damn.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.468
So this is where they staying at.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.137
-Of course.
-Shit.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.513
I could sleep in the lobby!

04:23.596 --> 04:24.848
They got a bellman and everything.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.307
Look at all these empty couches.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.686
Look, let's just wait and talk to him,
see what he's got to say about it.

04:30.979 --> 04:31.980
The fuck?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.066
She look like she going
to a vodka tasting.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.943
What is this bitch the queen of, Utah?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.738
What's up, y'all?
It's Reina Reign in this bitch,

04:39.821 --> 04:42.032
and we just touched down in the town.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.743
I heard the west needed a little rain.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.784
Drip, drip.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.996
That's not cool. We're in a drought.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.123
Hey, yo, what's up, superstars?

04:50.206 --> 04:52.207
-How y'all feeling?
-Hey, you get the video I sent you?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.336
I did. I did. It was a little grainy.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.795
What was that, a iPhone 6?

04:55.879 --> 04:57.505
My nigga, you got us at the Worst Western.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.466
Yeah. And we already not getting paid.
Okay?

04:59.549 --> 05:01.593
No hair, no makeup, no wardrobe.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.262
How do you want me to perform, to rap,
if I have asbestos of the lung?

05:04.346 --> 05:05.930
I could have slept on the fucking bus.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.098
That's still an option.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.850
Nigga, what?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.435
-Chastity, let me talk to you. Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.686
I'ma handle this.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.231
I know you haven't done this before,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.400
so I'm gonna just, like,
break down how it goes.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.402
Usually, there's a budget.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.363
You're only allowed
a certain amount for rooms.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.657
So some cities just gon' be
a little rougher than others.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.950
A little rougher.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.786
That's just how it goes, okay?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.330
It's a difference between rough and "SVU."

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
This shit not good for morale.

05:32.540 --> 05:36.002
And I'm paying for shit out of my pocket
with money I don't have.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.962
So you're broke and it's my problem?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.092
Go make them some money
and stop making me look like the bad guy.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.804
Chastity says she's gon' take care of it.
So we are good.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.013
Y'all voices warmed up?

05:47.847 --> 05:48.807
You memorize the freestyle?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.975
Yes, and I'm gonna perform it
like it's a real freestyle.

05:51.058 --> 05:52.977
And that's why I love you.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.397
Alright, y'all, we are headed
to Regulars Only.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.109
Some super exclusive shit
where the real people from the city go

05:59.192 --> 06:03.363
and some of the hottest artists
and tastemakers come to party.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.074
You already know

06:06.157 --> 06:08.535
Reina and the girls
gon' mash up the stage.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.787
Ah, big tings we, uh, do.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.207
I hope y'all got y'all caskets out

06:14.290 --> 06:15.250
-Dead.
-Kill it.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.334
Murdera!

06:16.918 --> 06:17.794
Dirty wine!

06:17.877 --> 06:18.795
Blood guts.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.423
I got some money in my turban

06:21.506 --> 06:22.674
Layaway, bitch

06:22.757 --> 06:23.925
Put some money on your Birkin

06:26.302 --> 06:28.555
Ooh, let me see you rub it in
like it's Jergens

06:28.930 --> 06:30.932
Yeah, I like a bitch
with some money on it

06:31.391 --> 06:33.560
I've been searching for that
pussy like a bounty hunter

06:33.643 --> 06:34.978
I just wanna see you flip like a...

06:35.061 --> 06:37.105

06:38.398 --> 06:39.733
Niggas looking real regular.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.318
God, the one time
I don't wear a fucking hoodie.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.195
Man.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.906
Niggas did not put that shit on.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.452
Yo, y'all filming a reality
TV show or something?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.121
Cool, they think we from Zeus TV.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.706
Y'all look good. Don't trip.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.374
Guys, they're gonna kill us.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.251
They're gonna eat us alive.
This is not gonna be good.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.296
I'm gonna see if I can go find y'all
something to eat or a snack.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.757
Hey, yo! I got us a section.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.133
Yeah. Thank you.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.012

07:53.390 --> 07:55.016
You over here with the scarcity mindset.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.727
You need to have an abundance mindset.
Okay?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.771
Do you know how many niggas
there are that want you?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.398

08:27.841 --> 08:29.384
They ain't got shit to eat.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.136
Shout out to Guapdad in the house.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.513
Real town biz. Let's go!

08:33.596 --> 08:34.514

08:40.061 --> 08:41.395
Man, fuck that nigga.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.952
-Yeah.
-What you doing out here?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.287
Shit, I'm managing now.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.331
I'm actually on tour with one
of my acts, Shawna and Mia.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.084
They performing with
Reina Reign tomorrow night.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.461
-Okay, okay.
-That's tight.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.962
You opening up for Lord AK?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.297
-Yes.
-Oh, my God.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.299
-You on the come up.
-You know how I do.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.135
I told you, we'd take care of you
when you in The Town.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.386
-That's love.
-You know.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.637
What you doing after this?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.264
I'm on what y'all on. Where the money at?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.683
-Come on, it's over here.
-I know y'all got it.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.060
I know y'all got it.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.522
Y'all having a good time?
Give it up for my bro, LaRussell!

09:27.025 --> 09:30.111
Huh, Black boy, go get your shine on

09:30.195 --> 09:32.322
Could do anything you put your mind on

09:32.405 --> 09:35.075
They probably can't do it
if they ain't do it

09:35.158 --> 09:36.993
Trying to convince a nigga
who done did it

09:37.452 --> 09:38.453
Yo. What's up?

09:38.536 --> 09:39.954
-Hey.
-Feeling good?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.833
Okay. I knew you would fuck with this.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.544
This reminds me
of the open mic at Jazmin's.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.213
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.548
You know, real hip-hop head types.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.301
Sorry. I don't know. I'm just worried

09:53.385 --> 09:54.719
because I don't know if
this is the type of crowd

09:54.803 --> 09:56.262
that, like, fucks with us, you know?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.890
Shawna, it's three bad bitches.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.350
What's not to fuck with?

10:00.433 --> 10:04.479
No, it's two bad bitches
and a old bottle of Pepto Bismol.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.773
Well, somebody gonna have a tummy ache.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.024
-Whatever.
-Bet.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.317
Looking at her make me want to shit.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.284
Yo, what's this?

10:18.368 --> 10:19.703
It's called Regulars Only.

10:19.786 --> 10:23.039
It's like a bunch of local artists,
you know, like some low-key shit

10:23.123 --> 10:25.125
but not real low-key at the same time.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.543
Oh, bet. That shit hard.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.086
So what, you like it out there?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.212
Yeah.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.048
I wish you could see it
for yourself, though.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.466
You'll like it.

10:33.550 --> 10:37.637
Yeah. I've been wanting to go out there
and meet new people and shit, but...

10:37.721 --> 10:41.433
Well, we going to LA next,
so we might be able to get some time off.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.268
So what are you saying?

10:43.351 --> 10:46.312
I mean, I'm saying
you say you want to come to LA?

10:46.688 --> 10:49.065
Yeah? That's surprising.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
How? You trying to come down?

10:51.234 --> 10:53.653
I got to tell your moms
to kind of watch Melissa

10:53.737 --> 10:54.821
for a little bit longer.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.239
But, I mean, that shit doable.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.033
I know she gonna have attitude.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.284
Nah, she in a good mood.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.162
O'Shay was over there
when I had dropped off Melissa,

11:02.245 --> 11:03.621
-so we should be straight.
-What?

11:03.705 --> 11:05.290
Wait, so she swapped Gerard out?

11:06.708 --> 11:08.376
One thing about Robyn,
she gon' chase behind a nigga

11:08.460 --> 11:09.586
to get him to do something for her.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.212
She definitely committed.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.465
Look, I'm gonna make a few calls, alright?

11:15.550 --> 11:17.177
-I mean...
-I'ma hit you back.

11:19.012 --> 11:19.971
Girl, what just happened?

11:20.055 --> 11:23.475
Girl, take my phone.
I think I just invited Lamont to LA.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.643
-Why?
-I don't fucking know.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.021
Hey, man, make some noise
for my brother, LaRussell.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.398
-707 in the building, you know what it is.
-Yeah!

11:30.482 --> 11:32.942

11:39.282 --> 11:43.119
Hey, y'all ain't ready for
the motherfucking stuff.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.456
I can't wait for this bullshit.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.957
What is she doing?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.460
No, no, no. I can't do this.
I can't. I can't.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.003
I can't do this. I can't.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.588
-I can't go on the stage.
-You ain't got to. I got this.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.298
Hell wrong with y'all?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.050
-Y'all good?
-We're not doing this.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.177
Say less.
Ain't like we getting paid for this.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.929
And it's your day off.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.931
Francois? Francois, let me holla at you!

12:03.014 --> 12:04.599
-Thank you.
-Fo' sho'.

Yo.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.352
What's up? How y'all feeling?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.521
Good, good. But look,
they don't want to perform no more.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.315
-Yeah.
-Wait, wait.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.525
What are you talking about?

12:13.608 --> 12:15.276
We just gonna let her have the spotlight.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.070
Yeah. Yeah.
And if we perform with her,

12:17.153 --> 12:19.030
how are we going to stand out on our own,
you know?

12:19.114 --> 12:22.033
Right. And shit, we don't want to confuse
the audience anymore.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.160
She already got a fur coat on in summer.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.287
The people are lost.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.957
-You got that?
-Yeah, that part, that way,

12:29.040 --> 12:30.750
that selection, that direction.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.628
We got Reina Reign coming up
to the stage next, y'all.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.338
Just make sure you get your drinks.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.550
Alright, look, though, Guapdad said
he got a play for me at the club

12:38.633 --> 12:40.969

12:51.271 --> 12:53.273
Nah. Freddie just had a baby, bro.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.525
Hey, we could introduce her
to Rolo, though.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.568

Yo, they killed that shit, right?

19:23.955 --> 19:27.208
I want my fish fried hard
and I want it thick.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.045
I want people to wonder
if my fish got a BBL.

19:30.128 --> 19:35.425
I want the ass on my fish
to look like two Ethiopian foreheads

19:35.508 --> 19:37.635
just pootin' his way
through the Atlantic current.

19:37.719 --> 19:41.348
I want it thick like Kelly Price
lips and Cardi B ass.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.059
Don't give me a red snapper.
I want some red clapper.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.519

19:47.479 --> 19:48.938

-Hey, what you want?

20:48.957 --> 20:50.125
To say the least.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.961
And how long y'all been working
with Reina?

20:53.461 --> 20:55.714
That's new. That's very, very recent.

20:56.214 --> 20:59.300
I go way back with her producer,
and he just set us up on the tour

20:59.384 --> 21:01.219

Yeah. That nigga is relentless.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.182

21:06.266 --> 21:09.185
I didn't even know who she was,
but her team kept hitting us up,

21:09.269 --> 21:11.229
and next thing I know, she's on the tour.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.358
You know, these record labels don't give
a fuck about artistic integrity.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.987
Just try and keep y'all shit pure.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.780
-Yeah. We're trying.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.503
I'm sure you is.

21:50.769 --> 21:51.728
You wanna hit this?

21:53.897 --> 21:55.774
-Maybe.
-Sit down.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.151
Miyaki.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.368
So I've been listening to Dochie.
Really good TD artist.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.660
I know Dochie.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.037
Shit, and then TiaCorine.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.330
Yeah. We love Tia.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.248
It's really good. It's really good.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.501
-Yeah.
-Yeah, but this is crazy.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.419
Is this Cody?

22:16.503 --> 22:19.047
Yeah, this is new shit.
Unmixed, but...

22:19.130 --> 22:20.131
You just have the demos?

22:20.215 --> 22:24.969
Yo, this chord progression is so simple,
but it's so good.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.388
You be knowing the chords and shit.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.806
I do. I be knowing the chords.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.350
Yeah, my mama put me in piano lessons
when I was like three.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.520
And then I went to college,
I studied music.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.065
I really just thought I was Mozart
to these bitches for real.

22:37.732 --> 22:40.318
-I was doing the most.
-What you mean?

22:40.402 --> 22:42.195
I'm not ready to get into that with you.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.322
-Oh, okay.
-It's still painful for me.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.616
But thank God for Mia.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.120
She made this shit fun for me again.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.872
Yeah, y'all was crazy.

22:54.457 --> 22:57.502
Just felt really natural between you two.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.046
Yeah.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.340
It reminds me of my brother Brixx.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.384
Yeah, I heard about that.

23:05.635 --> 23:06.803
I'm really sorry.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.056
Yeah.

23:10.140 --> 23:14.811
I still listen to y'all's early mix tapes.
It's crazy. Like, that shit is legendary.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.021
For real.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.647
I miss that energy.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.608
Music's just...

23:21.901 --> 23:22.902
not the same.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.280
Yeah.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.492
But, you know,
maybe it's not supposed to be the same.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.705
It would be a disservice to you
and your artistry if,

23:34.456 --> 23:37.250
you know,
it didn't shift with you in your life.

23:39.169 --> 23:43.465
And I watch you from the audience
every chance that I can.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.216
I think everybody feels your energy.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.552
I mean, I feel it.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.680
I mean, if Mozart feels it, then...

23:53.308 --> 23:54.476
You ain't never been to LA?

23:55.518 --> 23:56.853
No.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.482
But I want to take a picture
in front of the Hollywood sign.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.859
And I want to go to
the Nipsey Hussle store.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.320
And I want to see Gucci Mane,

24:05.403 --> 24:07.864
if he got a star on
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.116
'Cause one day,
I'ma have a star on the Walk of Fame.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.619
You're cute.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.498
I got a session when we get to LA.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.501
Playing some of Lamont's music.

24:22.504 --> 24:25.006
Yeah, that's what's up.

24:26.174 --> 24:27.467
That's your nigga, right?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.386
No, that's my child's father.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.720
Is he anything else?

24:32.681 --> 24:33.848
No, I'm single.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.061
Where are you staying tonight?

24:40.105 --> 24:41.106
The R--

24:44.776 --> 24:46.986
I don't-- I forgot.

24:48.446 --> 24:49.447
Somewhere, though.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.533
Yeah.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.451
I'm at the Four Seasons.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.246
Nice.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.792
Let's go.

25:01.209 --> 25:02.085
Like, right now?

25:02.168 --> 25:03.378
Yeah.

25:05.255 --> 25:06.339
Let's go.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.391
This is cute. Is it Nefertiti?

25:16.474 --> 25:17.934

25:21.646 --> 25:22.939
so just let me know, nigga.

25:23.023 --> 25:24.899
-Nah, man.
-Oh, I see, I see.

25:26.526 --> 25:29.988
Oh, shit. Is that you, Shirley?

25:31.781 --> 25:34.159
Shirley! What's good, girl?

25:34.242 --> 25:36.244
It's good to see you
finally made it to AK.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.370
Congratulations.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.749
You know, you could have met my nigga
days ago and stayed dry

25:40.832 --> 25:42.334
if you had just played the game right.

25:42.417 --> 25:43.668
-You was tryin' to cheat!
-I think you have me mistaken

25:43.752 --> 25:45.170
-for another person.
-Nah, you was definitely tryin' to cheat.

25:45.253 --> 25:46.212
My nigga!

25:47.047 --> 25:48.715
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of something?

25:48.798 --> 25:50.842
Isn't there something else you can go do?

25:53.928 --> 25:56.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you.

25:56.639 --> 26:00.060
Yeah, don't trip.
I'll be over here if you need me. Yeah.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.937
Please ignore that nigga.

26:04.189 --> 26:05.857
You know what? I think I should go.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.359
My girl left.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.651
This was great.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.196
I really liked that we both love music

26:11.279 --> 26:12.572
and we share that.

26:12.655 --> 26:17.035
And I will see you at work.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.412
-Get home safe.
-Yep. Yeah. Bye.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.094
Let's go, let's go

-Fuck that plan

26:44.854 --> 26:47.732

26:47.816 --> 26:50.527

26:54.280 --> 26:55.990

27:19.973 --> 27:21.057
Can I get you anything?

27:30.984 --> 27:35.113
I want to be around you every day

27:37.157 --> 27:40.785
This feeling in my body's not the same

27:40.869 --> 27:42.412
Same

27:43.496 --> 27:46.583
Are you still down?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.384
The mirror's on my ceiling

27:56.468 --> 27:58.136
Ha-hah-hah

28:00.263 --> 28:01.264
You hungry?

28:02.265 --> 28:03.433
No, I'm...

28:04.100 --> 28:05.352
I'm fine.

28:06.144 --> 28:07.354
I'm fine.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.605
So right

28:08.688 --> 28:11.149
'Cause every day and every night

28:11.232 --> 28:12.650
I do, I do

28:12.734 --> 28:13.985
I can't get rid of you

28:16.071 --> 28:18.031
Yeah, let me get you some food.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.117
It's okay. For real.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.416
This is embarrassing.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.584
Why?

28:30.377 --> 28:31.878
Look, we got all night.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.799
Yeah, let me order something
off the hotel app.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.686
You know,
I ain't wanna tell you, but

28:49.187 --> 28:51.147
we staying at the Motel Express.

28:53.817 --> 28:57.529
Nah, it's all good.
I stayed at many Motel Expresses.

28:57.612 --> 28:58.571
When?

28:58.655 --> 28:59.656
Like a year ago.

29:00.865 --> 29:03.159
But you got to give off that
Four Seasons energy, though.

29:04.661 --> 29:05.912
Fake it till you make it, right?

29:06.788 --> 29:08.373
You don't seem like you do that.

29:08.456 --> 29:09.749
I mean, ain't everybody doing it?

29:09.833 --> 29:11.626
Maybe the ones who don't
believe in themselves.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.712
But I feel like you know
exactly who you are,

29:14.421 --> 29:15.338
and what you want,

29:15.839 --> 29:16.840
and you take it.

29:17.632 --> 29:19.134
It wasn't always like that, though.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.553
If you would have told me six months ago

29:21.636 --> 29:23.179
I would have been sitting right here,
right now,

29:23.972 --> 29:25.015
I wouldn't have believed it.

29:25.098 --> 29:26.725
Yeah, well, it really happens that fast.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.269
Before this, I was selling
brake pads at AutoZone

29:30.228 --> 29:31.438
trying to upsell antifreeze.

29:31.521 --> 29:32.689
-No.
-Yeah.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.526
But see, that's that hustler shit, though.
Sacrifice, I know all about it.

29:38.069 --> 29:39.070
But lately,

29:40.238 --> 29:41.781
I've been being more selfish.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.117
I told you you know what you want.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.583
You know, sausage good,
but this shit is ugly, though.

29:51.666 --> 29:54.294
Nigga, we get it, you don't like sausage.
We get it.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.339
I hear you.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.466
Good morning.

29:59.549 --> 30:01.343
Okay, come on, tell me about the dick.
How was it?

30:01.426 --> 30:04.429
I mean, I wouldn't know.
We just ended up talking.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.556
Talking?

30:06.639 --> 30:10.352
I had a good time with him, though.
What about you and Lord AK?

30:12.187 --> 30:13.396
What the fuck happened?

30:13.480 --> 30:14.856
Fucking Gat happened.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.274
He was over there
trying to make me look like

30:16.358 --> 30:17.609
some plotting-ass groupie.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.277
So I got my shit and I got out.

30:20.945 --> 30:22.614
-But you didn't wanna fuck him?
-Of course I wanted to fuck him.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.240
-Okay.
-I wanted to fuck him.

30:25.867 --> 30:26.910
Yeah.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.203
Chastity, you did all this?

30:28.828 --> 30:31.164
-Hell yeah.
-Oh, my God.

30:32.165 --> 30:33.041
Here you go.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.167
I'm hungry.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.960
We done taking scraps.

30:36.044 --> 30:36.920
-Yes.
-From here on out,

30:37.003 --> 30:40.882
it's go big or go home.
And we come too damn far to go home.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.300
So shit, let's eat.

30:42.384 --> 30:43.426
-Amen.
-Amen.

30:43.510 --> 30:44.928
Let's eat up, all this shit.

30:49.724 --> 30:53.228
I put my eggs in my pancakes
and, like, fold it like a little sandwich.

30:53.311 --> 30:54.604
And I put this in here like this.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.981
That's nasty.
You playing with your food?

30:57.065 --> 30:58.024
I had a toothpick.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.192
You ain't got a fork?

31:00.694 --> 31:01.945
Now, that's fucked up.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.405
Are you okay?

31:04.906 --> 31:06.241
Why the fuck would he post this?

31:09.077 --> 31:10.328
Oh, shit.

31:10.412 --> 31:12.330
Man, fuck that nigga. What the fuck?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.917
She rollin', she rollin'

31:16.001 --> 31:17.544
She climbin' that pole

31:17.627 --> 31:19.379
And I'm in love with a stripper

31:19.462 --> 31:21.881
She trippin', she playin', she playin'

31:21.965 --> 31:24.342
I'm not goin' nowhere, girl,
I'm stayin'

31:24.426 --> 31:26.052
I'm in love with a stripper

31:26.136 --> 31:27.512
She's every man's dream

31:27.595 --> 31:29.139
She's God's gift to Earth

31:29.222 --> 31:30.473
Women they love 'em too

31:30.557 --> 31:32.475
That's what you call a women's worth

31:32.559 --> 31:33.852
See I love all the strippers

31:33.935 --> 31:35.603
Because they show me love

31:35.687 --> 31:37.063
They know I never pay

31:37.147 --> 31:39.065
It's free whenever I hit the club

31:39.149 --> 31:42.360
But I can't even lie,
the girls out here so fly

31:42.444 --> 31:44.237
She slidin' up and down that pole

31:44.320 --> 31:45.697
Got me mesmerized

31:45.780 --> 31:47.282
Mike Jones don't ever trick

31:47.365 --> 31:48.992
But goddamn she thick

31:49.075 --> 31:50.869
I can't lie, I must admit

31:50.952 --> 31:52.579
I'm in love with a stripper

31:52.662 --> 31:55.248
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'

31:55.707 --> 31:57.208
She climbin' that pole

31:57.292 --> 31:59.210
And I'm in love with a stripper

31:59.294 --> 32:01.629
She trippin', she playin', she playin'

32:01.713 --> 32:04.090
I'm not goin nowhere, girl,
I'm stayin'

32:04.174 --> 32:05.800
I'm in love with a stripper

32:05.884 --> 32:08.428
She poppin', she rollin', she rollin'

32:09.054 --> 32:10.472
She climbin' that pole

32:10.555 --> 32:12.390
And I'm in love with a stripper

32:12.474 --> 32:14.851
She trippin', she playin', she playin'

32:14.934 --> 32:17.312
I'm not goin nowhere, girl,
I'm stayin'

32:17.395 --> 32:19.356
I'm in love with a stripper

32:19.439 --> 32:22.233
Out of all the girls
she be the hottest

32:22.317 --> 32:23.943
Like in the way she break it down

32:24.027 --> 32:26.279
I see u girl...
