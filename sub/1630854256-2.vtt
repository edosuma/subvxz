hilarious.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.532
May I pass by you?

Hey! Leave

00:41.942 --> 00:43.844
that thing alone.
It's not bothering you.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.546
Yo, pipe down, old man.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.881
Put some respect in your tone
when you talk to me.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.084
Why you always
got a problem, huh?

01:00.861 --> 01:02.196
Whoa!

01:02.296 --> 01:03.897
Stop that van!

01:05.633 --> 01:09.337
Thanks for your order.
Have a nice day.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.406
Thanks for your order.
Have a nice day.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.295
Mmm, big relief.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.929
Huge relief.

01:36.029 --> 01:36.997
What's that?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.499
This coffee's excellent.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.801
See, I must have
a great coffee shop

01:40.901 --> 01:42.603
within walking distance
of my new home.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.638
It's a deal breaker.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.006
Um...

01:46.106 --> 01:48.142
you do realize that we've
already moved in, correct?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.478
So, you're saying I should have
checked out the coffee shops

01:50.578 --> 01:52.079
before we signed
the lease?

01:52.180 --> 01:54.014
Yes, yes, yes, that
would've been a good idea.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.549
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.520
I have a meeting today at
the Surfrider Foundation.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.890
They have an opening on
their Blue Water Task Force.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.725
So you've made
your decision, huh?

02:04.825 --> 02:07.428
You're gonna leave
law enforcement?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.197
Yeah.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.931
Well, at least for now.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.334
And, I mean, I've always
loved the outdoors

02:13.434 --> 02:15.102
and I love
helping out, so...

02:15.203 --> 02:17.471
Yes, you've been so interested,
in fact, that you once

02:17.571 --> 02:19.573
made up a fake story
about cleaning up a town

02:19.673 --> 02:21.542
after wildfires when,
in fact, you were

02:21.642 --> 02:23.444
chasing down
a rogue Russian spy.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.279
I did do that.
Uh-huh.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.281
I still can't believe
you drove

02:27.381 --> 02:30.017
all the way out there
to surprise me.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.526
So...

02:38.626 --> 02:40.794
what can I help you with today?

02:40.894 --> 02:43.163
Callen?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.099
Good morning.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.504
Morning.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.075
Is everything okay?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.977
Sorry, what?

02:57.077 --> 02:58.446
Nothing.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.881
Nothing, the coffee's great.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.082
Hi, baby.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.817
So, the headline is Rosa is

03:03.917 --> 03:06.854
doing great,
and if you take into account

03:06.954 --> 03:09.189
the turmoil she's had
in her life the last six months,

03:09.290 --> 03:10.791
she's actually doing
better than great.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.192
Well, that's amazing.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.495
Did they say how she did
on her English essay?

03:14.595 --> 03:15.996
Oddly, she got an A.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.131
What do you mean "oddly"?
I helped her with that.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.132
Oh,

03:19.233 --> 03:20.401
I know, sweetheart.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.336
I also know that
you don't use commas

03:22.436 --> 03:23.504
in your speech or your writing.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.738
Okay, touché. Well played.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.206
Oh, and her teacher also said

03:26.307 --> 03:28.208
that she could use
some outside help for math.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.811
Did you say "outside help,"
like a-like a, like a tutor?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.480
Yeah.
No, she doesn't need a tutor.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.647
That's like a way
for us to shirk

03:33.747 --> 03:35.182
our parental responsibilities.

03:35.283 --> 03:36.617
No, she needs to see

03:36.717 --> 03:38.586
that if there's
obstacles at school,

03:38.686 --> 03:39.953
we are the first line
of assistance.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.154
Perfect.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.556
I will order
the calculus textbook

03:42.656 --> 03:44.157
and you can get right on that.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.293
Did you say calculus?

03:45.393 --> 03:46.460
I sure did.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.628
Oh, yeah, well,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.530
I mean, who are we

03:49.630 --> 03:51.098
to, in this economy,

03:51.198 --> 03:54.468
take away employment
from a hard-working...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.036
And qualified.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.405
...and qualified

03:57.505 --> 03:58.506
tutor.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.608
Bye, sugar bear.
I love you. Bye.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.510
You know what, Deeks?

04:02.610 --> 04:05.078
Tutors are people, too.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.150
Hey.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.452
Morning.
Morning.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.053
Where is everybody?

04:13.153 --> 04:15.022
Sam's gonna be out.
He's taking his dad

04:15.122 --> 04:16.924
to see a specialist
in Orange County.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.092
And last I saw heard,
Kilbride and Rountree

04:19.192 --> 04:22.029
were arguing about the outcome
of some college football game.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.497
Ooh, which game?

04:23.597 --> 04:24.932
I have no idea. As soon as
I heard the word "football,"

04:25.032 --> 04:26.934
the AirPods went
straight in.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.502
I thought you said
you liked sports.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.103
I like the Lakers.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.139
Specifically, Laker
games with my dad.

04:32.239 --> 04:35.042
Oh. Hey, uh,

04:35.142 --> 04:36.477
how is your mom doing?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.278
Well, she's... she's good.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.614
Her foot's healed, she's
done with physical therapy.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.282
But now that
she doesn't have anything

04:42.383 --> 04:43.917
to complain about or focus on...

04:44.017 --> 04:46.286
She can turn all her attention
back onto you.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.688
Exactly.
Oh.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.923
So we had a lovely
family brunch on Sunday

04:50.023 --> 04:52.159
where we all learned
that I am using

04:52.259 --> 04:54.328
the entirely wrong
skin care products.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.931
And I would do well if I
hired a personal trainer.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.801
Well, your family brunches
sound like a lot of fun.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.671
Yeah, you should see them
in person, live and in HD.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.673
I'd like that.
Really?

05:05.773 --> 05:07.641
Sure.
Okay.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.510
I'm gonna hold you to that.
All right.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.279
Rountree wants us upstairs.
We just caught a case.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.248
What do we got?

05:15.349 --> 05:17.785
This morning a husband
and wife architect team,

05:17.885 --> 05:19.553
Emmett and Linsey Sandhagen,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.722
were kidnapped
from their home in Westwood.

05:21.822 --> 05:22.990
Any witnesses?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.792
Yeah, the couple's nanny,
Mila Curren,

05:24.892 --> 05:26.627
she saw
the whole thing go down.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.195
Wait, they have kids?
Yeah.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.863
One daughter, one son.
Eight and ten.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.365
Mm. How are they doing?

05:31.465 --> 05:32.600
Luckily, they didn't
see anything.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.901
They're with the nanny now.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.135
Kilbride sent Castor
to pick them up

05:35.235 --> 05:36.336
and bring them back
to the boatshed.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.638
Why did we pull this case?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.139
The Sandhagens'
architecture firm--

05:39.239 --> 05:42.075
they specialize in designing
secure facilities.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.977
They've been working closely
with the Seabees

05:44.077 --> 05:46.179
as, uh, civilian
DoD contractors.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.716
And the Navy wants to know if
any of these secured facilities

05:48.816 --> 05:50.117
are now vulnerable.
You got it.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.153
LAPD CSU is processing
the crime scene.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.188
I'll let you guys know
if they find anything.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.057
Okay, Fatima, why
don't you meet Kensi,

05:57.157 --> 05:59.427
head up to Port Hueneme,
talk to the Seabees.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.728
Copy that.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.162
You and I will
head to the boatshed,

06:02.262 --> 06:03.731
speak with the nanny, huh?
Can I drive the Benzo?

06:03.831 --> 06:06.033
Uh, I don't think so.
Shotgun!

06:09.269 --> 06:11.371
So, where were you when
the intruders entered?

06:11.472 --> 06:15.443
I was upstairs, getting
the kids ready for school,

06:15.543 --> 06:17.545
when I heard Emmett yell.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.846
And did you actually

06:18.946 --> 06:21.682
see the Sandhagens
get abducted?

06:22.483 --> 06:24.585
I saw three guys in ski masks

06:24.685 --> 06:26.787
grab them in the kitchen.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.722
All I could think about
were the kids,

06:28.822 --> 06:30.824
so I went back upstairs

06:30.924 --> 06:33.360
and put them into one of
the Sandhagens' secured rooms.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.262
And the three men never
followed you upstairs

06:35.362 --> 06:37.064
or tried to breach
the secured door?

06:37.164 --> 06:40.267
It was like they only cared
about Emmett and Linsey.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.735
There's a lot of art

06:41.835 --> 06:43.937
a-and expensive things
around the house.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.305
It's all still there.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.675
And you saw them
escape in a van?
Yeah.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.644
I heard Linsey yelling
when they threw her in the van.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.345
Did you notice
any stress points

06:52.446 --> 06:55.182
in the Sandhagens' life,
any colleagues or friends,

06:55.282 --> 06:57.017
anybody, that they
would argue with?

06:57.117 --> 07:00.053
No. Nothing like that.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.056
This doesn't make any sense.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.359
The Sandhagens
are the best parents

07:06.460 --> 07:09.630
and just the nicest people.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.365
They took me to Hanalei
with them and...

07:12.466 --> 07:14.167
we had the best time.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.769
I'm sorry.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.838
It's okay.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.207
You never heard them
talk about being in debt,

07:20.307 --> 07:22.075
owing anyone money--
anything like that?

07:22.175 --> 07:25.312
No, money never seemed like
something they were short on.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.718
Those kids have no idea
what's happening.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.304
Admiral.
As you were.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.941
Kensi and Fatima
arrived at Hueneme yet?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.910
20 minutes out. Ah.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.315
Bring up Colonel
Jackson Ladd, please.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.851
Yes, sir.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.887
Coming up on
the big screen now.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.492
This address current?
I don't think so.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.528
His name was taken
off the utilities

08:14.628 --> 08:16.463
about six and a
half months ago.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.599
Look into his whereabouts,
will you?
Yes, sir.

08:18.699 --> 08:22.002
Uh, Admiral, if you
don't mind me asking,

08:22.102 --> 08:23.403
who's Colonel Ladd?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.238
He's one of the best
to ever put on a uniform.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.541
Served over 25 years
in the Army.

08:27.641 --> 08:31.411
Every conflict from
Desert Storm to Iraqi Freedom.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.549
His last deployment,
he lost both of his legs

08:35.649 --> 08:38.418
in a door breach explosion.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.654
Damn.
Yeah.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.257
He's had a rough go of it.
Trying to figure out

08:44.357 --> 08:46.860
where he fits in the world now.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.762
Hmm.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.566
Hell of a thing to be

08:52.666 --> 08:54.968
elite at something,

08:55.068 --> 08:58.438
to be defined by that thing...

08:58.538 --> 09:01.341
and then just have it all
taken away in an instant.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.311
Yeah.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.648
Keep me posted on Colonel Ladd.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.349
Yes, sir.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.585
<i>Bet the Sandhagens
never even envisioned</i>

09:11.685 --> 09:13.053
this as a possibility

09:13.153 --> 09:15.022
when they took their first
military contract.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.790
Yeah, I can't imagine
how they're feeling

09:16.890 --> 09:18.458
or worried they are
about their kids.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.293
Mm. Hopefully, the Seabees
can help us figure out

09:20.393 --> 09:22.996
a motive for the kidnapping.
Mm-hmm.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.198
Hey, where were you
coming from

09:25.298 --> 09:26.533
when you picked me up
this morning?

09:26.634 --> 09:28.702
Oh, I was at
Rosa's school.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.238
I had a meeting with
her academic advisor.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.706
Deeks had to log
his range hours,

09:32.806 --> 09:34.541
so it was just me. Mm.

09:34.642 --> 09:38.211
So, uh, how's the whole
parenting thing going?

09:38.311 --> 09:40.313
Is it, like, easier or, uh,

09:40.413 --> 09:41.448
harder than
you thought it would be?

09:41.548 --> 09:44.084
Um... it is not

09:44.184 --> 09:45.285
harder or easier.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.820
I think it's
just different.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.521
I mean, I was worried about
her emotional health,

09:48.622 --> 09:50.590
but she's made an amazing
group of friends

09:50.691 --> 09:52.826
and she seems really happy,
which is such a relief.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.095
Oh, man. How are you?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.631
I just realized I've been
wrapped up in all my own stuff

09:57.731 --> 09:58.832
that I haven't asked you
about Akhil or anything.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.567
What's happening with that?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.671
We've gone on a few dates.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.806
Okay. A few dates
is good. And?

10:05.906 --> 10:09.376
And we are now solidly
locked in the friend zone.

10:09.476 --> 10:12.279
Huh.
Yeah.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.981
Is that what you want?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.349
I don't know, maybe?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.819
Probably.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.488
I don't know, maybe I want more?
Okay.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.056
Oh, my gosh.
What is happening?

10:23.156 --> 10:24.692
What is happening with
all of this right now?

10:24.792 --> 10:27.494
Kens, I mean,
the last time I dated a guy,

10:27.594 --> 10:30.163
everything about me
was different.
Mm-hmm.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.631
I was acting.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.334
I was partying a lot,
I was going out every night.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.703
All night.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.838
That's just not
you anymore.
Not at all.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.973
I don't know.
After the accident,

10:40.073 --> 10:43.476
I changed everything
about myself.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.913
Literally, everything.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.848
Except for my family. Yeah.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.417
To be honest, I don't think
that that's a bad thing.

10:50.517 --> 10:51.584
It's not.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.754
But with Akhil...

10:53.854 --> 10:55.188
I don't know,
this is gonna sound crazy,

10:55.288 --> 10:58.158
but I have no idea
how this new version of me

10:58.258 --> 10:59.827
is supposed to be on a date

10:59.927 --> 11:02.195
and, like,
in a real relationship.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.164
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, forget it.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.036
I didn't know the old Fatima.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.073
But I know the new one.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.108
She is somebody
that I admire

11:15.208 --> 11:19.012
and I am really, really
proud to call you my friend.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.883
It honestly means a lot to me
coming from you,

11:22.983 --> 11:25.652
'cause I've always
looked up to you

11:25.753 --> 11:26.987
as sort of a... Stop.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.789
Before you call me
an older sister.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.391
No, no, no.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.126
I was gonna say,
like, a favorite aunt.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.361
Oh, my gosh!

11:34.461 --> 11:37.230
Get out.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.099
Aunt.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.403
It's a tough one.
Two great kids.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.105
And we need to find
their parents fast.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.007
All right, take Mila,
Ty and Sophia

11:47.107 --> 11:48.776
to the Naval Weapons
Station Seal Beach.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.277
We'll have an NCIS agent
look after them

11:50.377 --> 11:51.511
until we can get
a handle on this.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.213
Copy that.
I'll do it right now.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.316
Hey, guys, I just checked the
Sandhagens' personal accounts.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.719
All their cars are paid off,
no credit card debt,

11:59.820 --> 12:02.355
hefty retirement
and savings accounts

12:02.455 --> 12:03.991
and a second home in Hawaii.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.127
So, exactly like Kensi and I.
Minus the house in Hawaii,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.797
the retirement accounts
and the, you know, money. Yeah.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
All right, if there's nothing
that we can work with, why don't

12:11.398 --> 12:14.034
you look into their architecture
company and employees.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.469
Maybe there's some financial
motive buried in there.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.038
All right, on it.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.909
Admiral.
Where are we
with Colonel Ladd?

12:22.709 --> 12:23.977
His phone's offline

12:24.077 --> 12:26.113
and there's no credit card
or ATM activity

12:26.213 --> 12:27.480
in the last 30 hours.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.317
All right. Have LAPD
do a welfare check

12:30.417 --> 12:31.852
at the colonel's home.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.787
Yes, sir.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.158
I'm Commander Cheng.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.927
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting.
No problem.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.228
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye,

12:41.328 --> 12:42.729
this is Special Agent
Fatima Namazi.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.064
Commander.
It's good to
meet you both.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.665
Yeah.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.236
I supervised the projects that
Emmett and Linsey Sandhagen

12:49.336 --> 12:50.938
worked on with the Seabees.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.840
I've got to say, the Sandhagens
are well-liked around here.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.474
Uh, could you fill us in on

12:54.574 --> 12:56.243
exactly what they did
for the Seabees?

12:56.343 --> 12:57.644
Of course.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.613
But first, may I ask,
are their children okay?

13:00.713 --> 13:03.516
Yes, we have them
and they're safe.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.919
Good.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.988
So, the Sandhagens
were brilliant.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.990
They acted as
civilian contractors

13:10.090 --> 13:12.625
on three of our latest
and most important projects.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.095
So, we know Admiral Kilbride
has been in contact

13:15.195 --> 13:17.898
with the office of SECNAV
and that they've upped security

13:17.998 --> 13:19.466
at those three properties,

13:19.566 --> 13:23.070
but could you tell us exactly
what these projects were?

13:23.170 --> 13:25.238
The first was a weapons
and ordnance depot

13:25.338 --> 13:26.739
at Camp Pendleton.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.608
The second was an underground
drone control base

13:28.708 --> 13:30.077
in the Mojave.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.946
But the third project
was their masterpiece.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.982
That was the project
that wasn't in our briefing.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.850
Uh, we were told we needed
to speak with you directly

13:36.950 --> 13:38.952
to get more details.
The project was

13:39.052 --> 13:40.787
a fortified and secured
command center

13:40.888 --> 13:42.722
built directly into
the side of a mountain,

13:42.822 --> 13:45.725
location classified.
What kind of command center?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.027
A multiservice
missile deterrence

13:47.127 --> 13:48.561
command and
control center.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.731
And what does
this center control?

13:51.831 --> 13:55.535
Over 300 missiles
located on U.S. soil.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.504
Three hundred?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.172
Yeah.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.341
If the Sandhagens
were taken by

14:01.441 --> 14:02.876
a foreign interest
looking for control

14:02.976 --> 14:05.245
of that command center,
they can take out

14:05.345 --> 14:07.580
most of our domestic
military operations

14:07.680 --> 14:09.649
with those ballistic missiles.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.523
Hey, guys.
What do you got, Rountree?

14:16.623 --> 14:18.025
The Sandhagens
architecture firm

14:18.125 --> 14:20.160
has a third partner.
His name's Paul Figueiredo.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.861
Oh, let me take
a flyer here.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.363
Mr. Figueiredo is just
as rich as the Sandhagens?

14:23.463 --> 14:25.966
That's the thing, he's not.
He's doing well,

14:26.066 --> 14:27.767
but his home's worth a quarter

14:27.867 --> 14:29.536
of what one of the Sandhagens'
properties is.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.405
And he has credit card debt
and nowhere near the savings.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.741
And all three of them are
equal partners in the firm?

14:34.841 --> 14:35.808
Yeah, looks that way.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.011
Maybe the Sandhagens are

14:38.111 --> 14:39.512
funneling money
from the corporation.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.847
Maybe they're stealing from him.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.615
And Paul finds out
and goes after them.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.616
Maybe.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.118
Or maybe the Sandhagens

14:45.218 --> 14:46.686
are selling their classified
knowledge of properties

14:46.786 --> 14:48.021
like the ballistic
missile command center

14:48.121 --> 14:49.289
to the highest bidder.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.224
About a half a dozen
foreign countries

14:51.324 --> 14:53.293
would be interested in the plans
for those properties.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.263
Not to mention
terrorist organizations.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.540
Thank you for coming
down here with Agent Castor.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.009
I'm Special Agent Callen.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.377
This is Investigator Deeks.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.979
Hi, good to meet you.
No problem at all.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.613
I've been sick about this.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.515
If there's anything
I can do to help, I will. Great,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.184
that's great, 'cause we do
have some questions for you.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.418
For sure. First,

15:18.518 --> 15:19.919
can I ask-- Ty
and, uh, Sophia--

15:20.020 --> 15:21.554
how are they?
Are they with Mila?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.523
They are.
And they're all
at a secured location.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.093
Have a seat. Yeah.

15:26.193 --> 15:29.529
So, you and the Sandhagens
are equal partners

15:29.629 --> 15:31.664
in their military contracting
business, correct?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.333
We are. Yeah,
I own a third,

15:33.433 --> 15:35.002
Linsey owns a third,
Emmett owns a third.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.436
That means the profits
are distributed equally

15:36.536 --> 15:37.437
between the three of you?

15:37.537 --> 15:38.538
That it does, yeah.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.173
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

15:40.273 --> 15:42.575
but when we were looking into
the Sandhagens' finances,

15:42.675 --> 15:45.578
we realized that...
they have substantially

15:45.678 --> 15:47.780
more capital and
savings than you do.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.018
You-you guys looked
into my finances.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.686
We did.
'Cause I wasn't
expecting that.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.723
But, uh... you saw
I've got nothing to hide.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.391
And the reason
for your different

15:58.491 --> 15:59.592
financial situation is?

15:59.692 --> 16:00.927
Simple.
I'm a partner

16:01.028 --> 16:02.729
in the military
contracting business.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.797
Six years ago, they started
a separate business

16:04.897 --> 16:07.600
dealing with, uh, civilian jobs.
I'm not a part of that firm.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.536
We didn't see
any other companies

16:09.636 --> 16:11.104
listed under their name.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.074
Yeah, they were very careful
to incorporate using trusts

16:14.174 --> 16:15.475
instead of their names

16:15.575 --> 16:18.011
to make sure this exact thing
wouldn't happen.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.312
So, what kind of civilian jobs

16:19.412 --> 16:20.447
are they taking
under this company?

16:20.547 --> 16:21.981
Safe rooms
in mansions,

16:22.082 --> 16:25.085
secured bug out cabins in
the mountains, specialty vaults.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.453
I mean, in this
day and age,

16:26.553 --> 16:28.255
this types projects
have become very popular

16:28.355 --> 16:29.756
among people with means.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.624
I mean, you look at the cash
they're pulling in,

16:31.724 --> 16:33.426
I'd say it's profitable.
Yeah, well,

16:33.526 --> 16:34.861
second homes are overrated.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.064
You got the property taxes
and the maintenance and...

16:37.164 --> 16:38.298
I'll stop talking.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.899
Well, anyway,
they asked me to

16:39.999 --> 16:41.168
partner with them in the private
sector business back then,

16:41.268 --> 16:42.769
but I turned them down.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.072
Why was that?
I love working with
the Sandhagens,

16:45.172 --> 16:48.575
but don't get me wrong,
I don-I-I don't live to work.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.878
Work for me is a means
to camp, hunt,

16:51.978 --> 16:54.347
surf, do jiujitsu.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.982
Basically just be
a human being.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.717
Did you regret your decision
once you saw how much money

16:57.817 --> 16:59.652
they were making?
Not at all. Are you kidding?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.321
They worked on that business
around the clock,

17:01.421 --> 17:02.789
24/7 to get it done.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.158
That was a...
that was a huge accomplishment.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.327
It's just not the life I want.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.229
I can respect that.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.798
You wouldn't happen
to have a list of their

17:11.898 --> 17:13.433
private sector clients,
would you?
I don't

17:13.533 --> 17:14.934
have access to that
because it's not part

17:15.034 --> 17:16.703
of the military
contracting business.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.972
But if I were you guys,
I'd check out their home office.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.575
That's where they ran
that business out of.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.180
Our ETA from
Port Hueneme is...

17:27.280 --> 17:28.415
about 40 minutes, sir.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.782
Copy that.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.685
We should have a list
of the Sandhagens'

17:32.785 --> 17:35.655
private sector projects
sent to your phones soon.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.024
A private sector motive
for the kidnappings makes sense.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.692
If they were targeting
a military facility,

17:39.792 --> 17:41.561
then they'd have to know
that the first step

17:41.661 --> 17:44.030
in our playbook is to up
security at any property

17:44.131 --> 17:45.365
the Sandhagens designed.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.500
And if they're in it
for profit over terrorism,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.969
then private sector assets
are way easier

17:50.069 --> 17:52.172
to offload and fence
than military tech.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.706
All valid points.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.643
But SECNAV is coordinating
with the purple suiters

17:56.743 --> 17:59.879
to keep that ballistic
missile command center safe.

17:59.979 --> 18:00.880
Keep me posted.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.449
Copy that, sir.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.084
Thanks.
All right.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.555
Evidently, architecture pays.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.291
I wanted to be an architect
when I was a kid.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.959
Yeah, honestly, it seems
to be a cool job

18:13.059 --> 18:14.527
minus the math
and engineering part.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.296
What kind of architect?
Uh, I don't know.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.232
I liked hotels, train stations,
airports, that sort of thing.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.934
Uh-huh, lots to unpack
with that statement.
Mm-hmm.

18:22.034 --> 18:26.105
Taken from their own home.
You know,

18:26.206 --> 18:28.841
at least the kids
didn't see it happen. Yeah.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.143
Hey, how's, uh,

18:30.243 --> 18:31.978
how's Rosa adjusting
to her new life here in LA?

18:32.078 --> 18:34.581
Oh, she's a champ.
So strong and resilient.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.449
Although I think
she's tired of me asking

18:36.549 --> 18:38.418
if there's anything
she wants to talk about.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.520
Well, I think we all are,
at this point.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.455
That just means I care.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.656
That's what love looks like.

18:43.756 --> 18:44.957
Speaking of caring
and loving,

18:45.057 --> 18:46.359
how's, uh, engagement
treating you?

18:46.459 --> 18:47.560
It's good.
Yeah? Good?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.329
Good. Good.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.865
She's trying to figure out what
her life will look like in LA

18:52.965 --> 18:55.001
when she's married and not
working in law enforcement.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.836
Well, she's an incredible
law enforcement officer.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.538
ATF would be lucky
to have her back,

18:58.638 --> 18:59.806
but I do get the reluctance

18:59.906 --> 19:01.741
of being a two-badge
family. Man, do I.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.843
I'm sure you do.
And if you do decide

19:03.943 --> 19:05.312
to have children...
Kids?

19:05.412 --> 19:07.480
We just got engaged.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.115
Okay?
We are not even close to that.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.751
I'm just saying if and/or when,
it's a big decision to make.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.454
Uh-huh.
And here is the home office.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.656
Good talk.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.759
Rountree,

19:19.859 --> 19:21.294
we got a desktop
in the home office.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.464
Should have a signal for you
in just a couple minutes here.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.166
Copy that.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.470
All right.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.904
Boom.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.173
Got access to the computer.
Thanks, Callen.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.743
Starting the search
protocol now.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.980
Sitrep, Agent Rountree.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.217
So, Callen and Deeks
were able to gain access

19:44.317 --> 19:47.320
to the Sandhagens' private
sector business computer.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.488
And?

19:48.588 --> 19:50.089
And...

19:50.189 --> 19:51.958
judging by all these
client files,

19:52.058 --> 19:55.094
there's a lot of banks,
stores and high net worth

19:55.194 --> 19:57.364
individuals' homes
to go through.

19:57.464 --> 20:00.767
Okay, bring LAPD up to speed

20:00.867 --> 20:02.769
and have them notify
these clients

20:02.869 --> 20:05.972
of a possible security breach
and to stay vigilant.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.274
Will do. Also,

20:07.374 --> 20:10.477
have both teams check out
any high-value targets

20:10.577 --> 20:11.678
that are near them.

20:11.778 --> 20:16.115
I'll also bring FBI HRT on.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.917
Yes, sir.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.152
Oh, um...

20:20.253 --> 20:23.890
LAPD wasn't able to
locate Colonel Ladd

20:23.990 --> 20:25.892
during the welfare check
at his apartment.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.528
Ah.
I figured as much.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.096
Yeah.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.998
Oh, and there was
something else.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.505
They found a few
empty whiskey bottles

20:38.605 --> 20:41.007
and a bunch of empty beer cans.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.109
And what else?

20:43.209 --> 20:45.878
Uh... nothing else.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.582
Geez, you had me
worried for a second.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.919
Uh...
Let me give you a little
history lesson, Agent Rountree.

20:53.019 --> 20:56.556
Before your generation
unleashed mindfulness

20:56.656 --> 20:57.824
and-and meditation on the world,

20:57.924 --> 21:00.960
many, many
generations before you

21:01.060 --> 21:03.730
achieved the exact same result

21:03.830 --> 21:07.199
utilizing the combination
of whiskey and beer.

21:12.539 --> 21:15.842
Whiskey and beer.
Got it.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.209
That armored truck depot
was locked up tighter

21:17.310 --> 21:18.378
than Fort Knox.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.779
And with every security guard

21:19.879 --> 21:21.481
in that Beverly Hills
watch store strapped,

21:21.581 --> 21:24.016
it's like they're kind of hoping
that they're gonna get robbed.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.217
What's next?

21:25.318 --> 21:27.119
We have a bank on
Santa Monica Boulevard.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.356
Mm-hmm.
A place called Even Mavrik,

21:29.456 --> 21:31.724
a high-end cigar
and wine store...
Hold on, what's that?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.093
Even Mavrik?

21:34.193 --> 21:36.396
<i>Even Mavrik.</i>
That's Hebrew.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.897
That means brilliant stone.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.299
Oh, could be a diamond broker. Okay.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.001
It's close, .3 miles away.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.203
Let's go check out some
<i>avanim mavrikot.</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:45.572
<i>What you got, Rountree?</i>

21:45.672 --> 21:47.407
I just got an alert

21:47.507 --> 21:48.641
on a system check I was running

21:48.741 --> 21:50.176
on the Sandhagens'
home computer.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.812
That list of private sector
clients that I sent you--

21:52.912 --> 21:54.347
it was downloaded last month.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.383
Maybe they needed it
for quarterly taxes?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.017
Maybe, but I checked.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.387
At the time it was downloaded
at their home in Westwood,

22:00.487 --> 22:02.889
both Sandhagens
were up at Port Hueneme

22:02.989 --> 22:05.257
working with the Seabees
on a new project.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.427
And you verified that?

22:07.527 --> 22:08.961
Yup. I just got

22:09.061 --> 22:10.963
off the phone with Commander
Cheng up at Port Hueneme.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.231
Sounds like
we're gonna have to

22:12.331 --> 22:14.767
have another talk
with Mila the nanny.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.680
Thank you, Castor.
You can leave the door open.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.916
Go ahead and take a seat. Oh...

22:31.017 --> 22:33.085
This room's a little more
cramped than the one out there.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.287
Yeah, well...

22:35.388 --> 22:37.023
this is our
interrogation room.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.726
Oh.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.360
Sounds official.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.096
Hopefully, you're making
some progress...

22:44.196 --> 22:46.466
Absolutely.
Just to clarify,

22:46.566 --> 22:48.300
so, you've been working
with the Sandhagen kids

22:48.401 --> 22:50.737
since you graduated college
at Harvey Mudd?

22:50.837 --> 22:51.871
Yes.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.306
It took me a little
longer to finish.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.242
I didn't have rich
parents paying for me.

22:56.342 --> 23:00.279
But you managed to graduate
with a computer science degree.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.015
It was tough,
but I'm glad I stuck it out.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.719
You also picked up
$230,000 in college debt.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.187
Yeah.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.556
How did you know...
And although
the Sandhagens

23:09.656 --> 23:11.691
pay you a generous salary,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.926
after your-your rent, your
food, your car payments...

23:14.026 --> 23:16.162
Wi-Fi, cell phone, random lattes

23:16.262 --> 23:19.331
at Alfred's...
It doesn't leave you
with enough to cover

23:19.432 --> 23:21.267
those monthly
student loan payments,

23:21.367 --> 23:25.004
but somehow you seem
to have managed.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.674
Even without rich parents.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.778
It's been difficult,
but I work...
I can imagine.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.313
Every single month,
coming up with that spare cash

23:34.413 --> 23:37.316
to go down to the 7-Eleven
by your apartment

23:37.416 --> 23:41.420
and buy a money order for those
very expensive student loans.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.123
Okay. I mean,

23:44.223 --> 23:46.025
is there anything
wrong with that?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.094
Nothing.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.395
As long as you have records

23:49.496 --> 23:50.897
for the incoming cash,
of course.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.132
Records?

23:53.232 --> 23:55.001
Hmm. Records.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.505
I mean,

23:58.605 --> 24:01.107
I sell some of my clothes
to Buffalo Exchange

24:01.207 --> 24:02.374
and they pay in cash.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.076
Seems like
a lot of extra clothes.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.377
That's okay.
We'll subpoena

24:05.478 --> 24:06.713
Buffalo Exchange's records.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.015
Anything else
you want to tell us?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.486
My parents were s-so excited

24:13.586 --> 24:15.788
when I got into Harvey Mudd.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.357
We just didn't realize
how much debt

24:18.457 --> 24:19.792
it would put me in.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.629
Believe it or not, I can
make more being a nanny

24:22.729 --> 24:25.364
than working a job
with my degree.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.935
My mom is sick,
so I have to be in LA,

24:29.035 --> 24:31.904
and there's no way to live here
under debt like I have.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.406
So, who did you
borrow money from?

24:36.643 --> 24:38.077
Mila,

24:38.177 --> 24:40.312
we know you don't want to see
the Sandhagens get hurt.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.849
And we know you want those kids
to see their parents again.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.752
Just help us,
and we'll make that happen.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.894
I met him at a restaurant.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.296
He was so nice.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.798
I owe him

24:58.898 --> 25:02.869
so much, and there's no way
that I can pay him back.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.137
He said he wanted
to rob some place

25:05.237 --> 25:06.505
the Sandhagens designed.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.708
He wasn't supposed
to kidnap them. No one

25:08.808 --> 25:11.377
was supposed to get hurt.
What is his name?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.446
His name's McCall.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.948
Josh McCall.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.318
Rountree, I need you
to locate Josh McCall.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.854
He told you he'd clear the debt

25:21.954 --> 25:24.390
if you gave him
that list of properties.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.595
No one was supposed to get hurt.

25:32.031 --> 25:35.234
Looks pretty empty.
Yeah, looks like it's under
renovation or something.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.769
Half of LA
is being renovated.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.104
You're telling me.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.505
I've lived here my whole life

25:39.606 --> 25:42.541
and I don't recognize
the skyline anymore.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.544
Looks like nobody's
working today.

25:47.013 --> 25:50.016
Hey, check it out.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.555
Someone went in
through the vent.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.998
<i>So, this guy Josh McCall--</i>

26:06.098 --> 26:09.101
uh, he's been in and out
of the system his entire life.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.837
His greatest hits include

26:10.937 --> 26:14.173
grand theft auto,
battery, assault,

26:14.273 --> 26:15.474
DUI and forgery.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.276
What's he doing now?
LAPD RHD believes

26:17.376 --> 26:20.146
that he's an associate
of a guy named Chito Aldana.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.749
Aldana is suspected
of running an elite heist crew.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.684
The same guys that were
suspected of hitting

26:24.784 --> 26:26.085
the art gallery in Beverly Hills

26:26.185 --> 26:28.254
and that bank off
of Wilshire Boulevard last year.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.256
Yeah, I heard about those.
In and out. They're pros.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.490
Yeah.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.992
Well, if he's running
with a heist crew,

26:33.092 --> 26:35.194
it makes sense that he'd
tell them about the Sandhagens.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.528
Send us McCall's address

26:36.629 --> 26:38.064
and call in an emergency
search warrant.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.766
All right. Copy that.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.816
What the hell's taking
so long up there?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.450
The minute they saw us coming,

26:58.550 --> 27:00.787
they locked themselves in their
own vault with the diamonds.

27:00.887 --> 27:01.988
Son of a bitch.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.622
You should have
planned for this.

27:03.723 --> 27:04.924
I did, Chito.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.458
That's why we
grabbed the couple.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.027
They built and
designed this vault.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.128
They can get us in.

27:09.228 --> 27:10.830
You sure as hell
better hope they do.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.765
And they better
do it fast.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.541
Shoot, I got
no cell service, do you?

27:23.776 --> 27:25.077
Nothing.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.113
They must be using
a local signal jammer.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.314
Well, it seems like
the Sandhagens

27:28.414 --> 27:29.849
are on the floor above us.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.483
We need to get to them
before they open that vault.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.685
Once that happens...

27:32.785 --> 27:34.153
They become dispensable.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.088
We got to do this
quickly and quietly.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.290
Don't want to risk gunfire
giving up our positions.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.994
So we might be outgunned,
we have no backup,

27:42.094 --> 27:43.730
we don't know how many guys
we're up against

27:43.830 --> 27:45.865
or where they are.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.234
What could possibly go wrong?
Mm.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.016
Clear.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.517
Clear.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.920
Ah, this dude McCall certainly
ain't gonna be saying

28:08.020 --> 28:11.824
"Hey, AD, welcome to my house!"
anytime soon.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.059
What are you talking about?

28:13.159 --> 28:15.694
AD home tours.
AD home tours.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.563
Those words mean nothing to me.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.031
And you telling me
you don't watch

28:19.131 --> 28:20.900
<i>Architectural Digest</i>
Home Tours?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.568
Yeah, I can think of
about a million things

28:22.668 --> 28:25.004
I'd rather do with my time
than to sit around and watch...

28:25.104 --> 28:28.374
Kendall Jenner tell you
how she styled her foyer

28:28.474 --> 28:29.675
around a James Turrell?

28:29.776 --> 28:31.210
I think not.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.711
I think I miss Sam.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.713
You definitely
don't mean that.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.316
It's hurtful, and
I don't receive it.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.717
Here we go.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.888
Looks like our boy
McCall plays the lotto.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.756
Wonder if you can
collect that from prison.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.828
You don't really
miss Sam, do you?

28:49.829 --> 28:50.830
<i>What do you got?</i>

28:50.930 --> 28:52.999
So, I couldn't
reach Kensi and Fatima

28:53.099 --> 28:56.135
even though their location
has full strength cell signals.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.470
So you think that somebody's
using a cell jammer

28:58.570 --> 29:00.172
to take their phones out.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.809
Yeah, so I decided
to go back and figure out

29:02.909 --> 29:04.543
when was the last time
we had connection

29:04.643 --> 29:06.378
to their phones, and watch this.

29:06.478 --> 29:07.646
I went back and...

29:07.746 --> 29:09.348
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.750
What was that movement?
Yeah, 17 minutes ago,

29:11.851 --> 29:13.786
their location went
from Thousand Oaks

29:13.886 --> 29:17.023
to Van Nuys and Studio City,
all within five minutes.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.290
It ain't just a cell blocker.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.826
Somebody is using
some sort of device

29:19.926 --> 29:21.627
that actually throws the signal.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.162
And it falsifies
their location.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.298
It's pretty glitchy.
It's not military strength.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.435
Probably some cheap setup
bought online.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.870
I hate the Internet.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.704
I want to know where
Agents Blye and Namazi are,

29:32.805 --> 29:34.040
right now.
Yes, sir.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.878
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.058
Red, where you at?

30:17.950 --> 30:19.718
Go, go, go, go, go.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.921
I got it, I got it.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.721
They got the Sandhagens.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.389
And we got...
McCALL: Hey, Chito.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.625
Red and Bobby are gone.

30:59.725 --> 31:00.993
They're not at their posts.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.229
Where the hell are they?
They get scared and run?

31:03.329 --> 31:05.464
No, I don't think so,
I found this.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.899
It's Red's hat.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.835
Someone's in here.
Someone took them out.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.471
It's got to be guards
for the diamond brokers.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.273
We must have just missed them.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.042
What if they already
called the cops?

31:16.142 --> 31:18.510
Find these guys now.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.214
Get that vault open!

31:22.314 --> 31:25.952
I know you can hear me.
We're coming for you!

31:26.052 --> 31:29.788
You won't leave
this building alive.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.735
What do we got, Rountree?

31:43.835 --> 31:45.437
The lotto tickets you guys found

31:45.537 --> 31:47.239
at McCall's place were
purchased at a gas station

31:47.339 --> 31:49.075
right down the street
from one of the Sandhagens'

31:49.175 --> 31:50.509
private sector projects.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.677
Who were the clients?

31:51.777 --> 31:52.979
A group of diamond brokers.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.413
They hired them
to design and build

31:54.513 --> 31:56.315
a hidden inventory vault
and a safe room.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.583
That's got to be it.

31:57.683 --> 31:58.817
Yeah, I'm sending you
the address now.

31:58.917 --> 31:59.785
Kensi and Fatima en route?

32:00.786 --> 32:01.853
We don't know where they are.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.289
I'm sorry, what?
Wherever they are,

32:03.389 --> 32:04.856
there's a signal
thrower running.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.593
If McCall is at that address,
there's a good chance

32:07.693 --> 32:09.996
that that's where Kensi
and Fatima are. Rountree,

32:10.096 --> 32:11.430
find 'em.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.233
I'm gonna drop a bullet
into one of your heads

32:14.333 --> 32:16.202
if you don't get
that vault open now.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.936
We're working as fast as we can.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.605
We have to go through
each lock manually.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.707
It's gonna take
as long as it takes.

32:21.807 --> 32:24.043
No!
Maybe I just end you now

32:24.143 --> 32:26.278
and we see if she can
get it done without you.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.114
No.

32:28.214 --> 32:30.649
He won't hurt the Sandhagens
until they open the vault.

32:37.889 --> 32:38.624
Hey, Chito.

32:38.724 --> 32:39.992
I swept the first floor,

32:40.092 --> 32:42.394
bathrooms, nothing.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.930
Maybe they are the cops.
Shut up and man up.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.933
All right, let's check
this floor, then.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.068
You, stay here with them.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.669
Get that vault open!

32:50.769 --> 32:52.838
You better hope to God
there's someone else here,

32:52.938 --> 32:54.873
because if your guys
ghosted us,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.243
I'm gonna kill them both
before the day's over.
They're not like that.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.478
I found Red's hat,
you know?
Shut up about

32:59.578 --> 33:00.846
the damn hat already.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.349
All right, look.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.451
I'm gonna go down to the first
floor and draw them to me.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.153
That should give you a window
to take out the guard

33:07.253 --> 33:08.320
and secure the Sandhagens.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.955
You good on your own?
You know it.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.957
Let's do this, sister.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.014
First floor.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.349
<i>We're five minutes out.</i>

33:37.449 --> 33:39.218
Have we made contact yet?

33:39.318 --> 33:40.786
No. Not-not yet.

33:40.886 --> 33:41.987
Damn it.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.637
What the hell?

33:58.737 --> 33:59.971
Federal agent.

35:49.681 --> 35:50.916
Are you guys okay?
Yeah.

35:51.016 --> 35:51.917
You're safe now.
Thank you.
We're good.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.051
All right.
Thank you.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.820
Our kids?
How are they?

35:54.920 --> 35:56.355
They're safe.
We have them.

35:56.455 --> 35:58.957
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.995
Hey. You good?

36:17.943 --> 36:19.010
When are you coming home, Mom?

36:19.110 --> 36:20.646
We'll be there
soon, sweetie.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.081
Agent Castor bought
us ice cream.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.818
That's great, buddy.
Can't wait to see you.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.820
Love you.
Love you.

36:28.920 --> 36:29.888
I love you.

36:29.988 --> 36:32.391
I love you, guys.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.762
I don't know how we'll ever
be able to thank you.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.397
It was our pleasure.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.432
LAPD will give you
a ride home.
Thank you.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.067
Yeah.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.972
Whew. You guys
did great. Thanks.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.807
So, Mila was the one
behind all of this?

36:48.907 --> 36:50.276
Yep, getting crushed by debt,

36:50.376 --> 36:52.578
didn't know what to do
and made herself a bad decision.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.846
She almost orphaned
two kids today.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.082
Yeah.
Well, I think,
all things considered,

36:57.182 --> 36:58.950
it ended pretty well
for the Sandhagens.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.520
And those diamond brokers. Hmm.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.655
I could really use
a cold drink.

37:03.755 --> 37:04.856
Ooh.
Well, you know what,

there's an amazing

37:06.525 --> 37:07.793
right around the corner.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.428
Ooh, I could definitely eat.
I could eat.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.729

Even better.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.715
I didn't.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.451
Walked in and saw the place.

38:05.551 --> 38:08.153
Look, I appreciate what you
and the guys are trying to do

38:08.253 --> 38:09.154

38:09.254 --> 38:10.889
but I'd rather do
a deep dive

38:10.989 --> 38:13.392
with a weight belt and no tank

38:13.492 --> 38:17.763
than to work in some cubicle
doing phone sales.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.732
Scotch. Neat.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.713

Then I moved to Intel,

where I protected and led
some of the toughest,

38:37.683 --> 38:40.552

38:40.652 --> 38:42.521

what happened on Sunday?

38:42.621 --> 38:43.889
I'm walking into the store.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.492
Old lady runs ahead of me,
opens the door,

38:46.592 --> 38:48.794
looks at me with those eyes.

38:48.894 --> 38:51.863
Like I was less than.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.866
I was a damn
super hero, Hollace.
