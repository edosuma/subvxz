00:01.043 --> 00:02.875
[Aaron] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.789
This is a dangerous moment.

00:04.922 --> 00:08.540
Our goal must be to create
lasting peace for both countries.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.257
There's nothing about
your father's nuclear program.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.466
That's why we brought you in here.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.802
He's not developing nuclear weapons.

00:13.931 --> 00:16.093
He already has them.

00:16.225 --> 00:19.468
Per the new agreement, you're responsible
for dismantling the missiles.

00:19.603 --> 00:23.267
Don't comply and my country
will see that as a declaration of war.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.775
[Emily] Thank you for coming in, Simon.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.938
You have been reporting
confidential information.

00:28.070 --> 00:28.980
It's called journalism.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.649
| need phone records on a reporter
named Simon Day.

00:31.782 --> 00:34.240
Don't go through a phone company
or leave a trail.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.735
-I need a warrant--
-This is a time-sensitive issue, Chuck.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.327
This intel is reliable?

00:39.456 --> 00:41.493
Chatter started right after
the treaty was signed.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.582
So somewhere here in the US,
there's a dirty bomb?

00:43.710 --> 00:45.963
-Yes, sir.
-Then we damn well better find it.

00:49.633 --> 00:53.342
-[Kim] Mr. President--
-Chairman Kim, I'll talk. You'll listen.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.178
Since we last spoke,
we've gotten credible information

00:56.306 --> 00:58.297
that there's a dirty bomb on US soil.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.344
Chatter we've been monitoring
about missing nuclear waste

01:00.477 --> 01:02.184
that's made its way to US shores.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.519
It was probably used to make the bomb.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.480
What does that have to do with me?

01:06.608 --> 01:09.521
The time stamp on the intelligence
pertaining to the bomb

01:09.653 --> 01:12.862
coincides with the execution
of your treaty with West Hun Chiu.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.028
A treaty you publicly criticized
before the ink was dry.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.490
Yes,

01:17.619 --> 01:20.702
because it was the result of
naked American coercion.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.038
But my country honors
its international agreements.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.033
Yes, now that the chairman
has given his word,

01:26.169 --> 01:31.585
he considers this unfounded accusation
a grave insult to him and to his country.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.720
Mr. Chairman, when we trace
this bomb back to East Hun Chiu,

01:37.848 --> 01:40.306
an insult will be your last concern.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.558
Fabricated intelligence. Threats.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.728
| think I've had enough
of this American hospitality.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.603
Unfortunately, your departing flight
has been delayed indefinitely.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.646
On what grounds?

01:55.782 --> 02:00.071
Safety. Once the threat has been
neutralized and you're no longer at risk,

02:00.203 --> 02:01.659
you and your delegation are free to go.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.372
Until then, your security
is of paramount importance to us.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.288
Secret Service will escort you
back to your cars.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.289
[speaks Hun Chiuese]

02:17.220 --> 02:18.255
Think he's lying?

02:18.388 --> 02:21.255
Hard to say, sir.
Lying is his resting position.

02:21.391 --> 02:25.259
Making him stay reduces the risk
he detonates anything while he's here.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.932
It reduces, not eliminates.
The bomb could be anywhere.

02:28.065 --> 02:31.854
When it explodes, we'll have no way
to conclusively tie him to it.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.611
[stutters] If it explodes, sir.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.571
Sir, Director Foerstel's here.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.484
Aaron...

02:42.037 --> 02:45.405
Sir, about the First Lady,
| wanna express my condolences.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.032
- I deeply regret--
-What do you have for me?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.119
The principal concern is terror.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.873
A dirty bomb's designed to maximize
that by using conventional explosives

02:56.009 --> 02:57.591
to disperse nuclear waste.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.212
Knowing we aren't dealing with a live nuke
isn't making me feel any better.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.430
-What's the blast radius?
-Depends on the ordnance.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.970
Several square blocks in a major American city

03:06.103 --> 03:07.969
could have to be cordoned off
for the foreseeable future.

03:08.105 --> 03:11.143
| don't need to tell you what an unprecedented
catastrophe that would be.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.562
So we've deployed
every asset at our disposal to stop it.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.982
| checked with the NRC
about spent domestic fissile material.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.730
Not a microgram is unaccounted for,

03:18.865 --> 03:22.153
which means that any radioactive waste
would likely be of foreign origin.

03:22.285 --> 03:26.620
Airport security is too tight. No way
a package like that gets across DHS.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.284
We need to look at harbors.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.829
Our west coast
is our closest port of entry to Asia.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.953
But sanctions restrict trade with East
Hun Chiu to medical aid and foodstuffs.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.672
All that trade is monitored
and happens in three places.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.258
Port of Charleston. Port of New York.
Baltimore Harbor.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.753
So we can narrow to search
to the eastern seaboard.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.845
Yes. I know time is of the essence.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.591
We could really use some assistance
from the private sector with data mining.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.640
We anticipated that for you.
Where's Dr. Frost?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.682
-Roosevelt Room, sir.
-Let's go.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.772
[indistinct chatter]

03:58.989 --> 04:02.152
Dr. Andrea Frost.
John Foerstel, director of the FBI.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.194
[Foerstel] Nice to meet you.

04:03.326 --> 04:07.194
Dr. Frost was kind enough to let us use
her platform, Lyra, to help find the bomb.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.948
We appreciate that. I know
what a robust investigative tool you have.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.748
-May I have a moment?
-Of course. Excuse us. Please.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.337
| didn't know I'd be working for the FBI.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.220
Not for them, you're working with them.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.480
Given the threat, we need
as much synergy as possible.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.849
| understand. But I already refused
to sell this technology to the government.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.817
I'm aware of that.
| give you my word.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.983
That we will not violate a single one
of your trademarks or patents.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.527
| have Fourth Amendment concerns, too.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.151
This technology can be deeply invasive.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.618
Andrea...

04:49.956 --> 04:52.573
Bombs do not have constitutional rights.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.040
We need...

04:56.046 --> 04:58.788
| need you to help me find this one.

05:01.009 --> 05:01.840
Yes, sir.

05:05.055 --> 05:09.094
[Joon] No. I don't believe
my father would do that.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.934
He hid nuclear weapons from the world
and lied about it.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.894
Why wouldn't he detonate a bomb
on US soil?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.729
Because he's not suicidal.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.234
[Blakey] But he is homicidal.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.602
-Isn't that why you wanted sanctuary?
-Yes.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.775
And he hates this treaty.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.775
But enough to attack America and plunge
East Hun Chiu into a war he can't win?

05:27.911 --> 05:31.029
You're assuming he thinks
he wouldn't get caught.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.247
He's smart enough to know
he'd be a suspect.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.118
The chairman is obsessed with survival.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.541
Attacking America
does not make that more likely.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.663
[Foerstel] Hannah?

05:44.427 --> 05:46.134
How's the kid look?

05:46.263 --> 05:49.096
Like he doesn't know more
than what he told us.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.556
We've got a lead, thanks to Andrea Frost.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.054
Lyra?

05:53.186 --> 05:56.804
Frost ascertained that spent nuclear fuel
has gone missing in Slovakia.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.898
She tracked a Bratislavan container ship
to Baltimore Harbor yesterday

06:00.026 --> 06:03.735
-containing cesium. Nuclear waste.
-Wait a minute.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.151
We've narrowed it down
to the DC metro area?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.149
Worse. I talked to the harbormaster.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.198
-The containers are adjacent to--
-East Hun Chiu shipping containers.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.661
East Hun Chiu could have offloaded
the material to its own container

06:13.790 --> 06:15.997
after the Bratislavan container
was already inspected.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.616
-[thuds]
-[Blakey] Hannah!

06:19.921 --> 06:21.503
-[Hannah] What happened?
-He just collapsed.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.340
-Did you see him take anything?
-No, but I went to check my email.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.596
Intel says the bomb may be
in the Port of Baltimore.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.507
Follow that.
I'll go with him to the hospital.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.471
| need an ambulance.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.806
Joon?

06:33.435 --> 06:34.846
[sighs] Damn it.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.766
[Kendra] If Moss leaked
classified information,

06:37.898 --> 06:39.013
he may have committed a crime.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.062
Then the president would like to consider
appointing a special prosecutor.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.685
| can't make that recommendation yet.

06:44.821 --> 06:48.940
-You said we might have a case.
-We might. The problem is the evidence.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.112
-I need to know its provenance.
-Meaning what?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.076
How'd you get it, Emily?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.446
Moss may have
endangered national security.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.665
-Does it matter how we obtained the evidence?
-Unfortunately, it does.

06:58.793 --> 07:03.538
Moss will fight back with every tool
at his disposal. We have to be scrupulous.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.507
Let's connect the dots and we can talk
about taking the next step.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.175
[indistinct chatter]

07:20.023 --> 07:21.855
[Geiger counter clicking]

07:25.362 --> 07:27.854
Joon Kim's in stable condition at Walter Reed.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.070
What'd he ingest?

07:29.199 --> 07:33.193
We'll know after his stomach is pumped.
Contents'll go to the lab.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.074
We can't assume it was self-administered.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.743
Better hope it was,
because we were protecting him.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.583
If he was poisoned or injected,
one of our own may have done it.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.088
[clicking]

07:43.213 --> 07:44.749
[bomb tech] We're getting
a radioactive signature

07:44.881 --> 07:46.667
from this East Hun Chiu container.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.584
This intel is based
solely on computer calculation?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.337
| don't care how we got it.
Only if it's right. Open it.

08:02.649 --> 08:03.889
[Geiger counter clicking]

08:04.025 --> 08:05.231
[bomb tech] 900 CPMs.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.521
Meaning what?

08:07.195 --> 08:09.857
[bomb tech] A significant radiation source
was just here, Agent Wells.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.409
What kind?

08:12.534 --> 08:15.071
[bomb tech] The kind
biological organisms shouldn't be near.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.198
[line ringing]

08:17.330 --> 08:18.286
Get me the president.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.406
[theme music playing]

08:31.594 --> 08:33.301
We don't know what this is.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.296
Correct. So you need to get to the bunker.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.592
What are we looking at?

08:36.725 --> 08:41.265
Proof of spent nuclear fuel in the DC area
that could be used to make a dirty bomb.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.102
All essential personnel are en route
to Command Ops.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.642
| need to talk to my kids.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.766
They're safe in Yellowstone
with your brother. Call when you're safe.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.893
| have to address
the White House staff first.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.443
Respectfully, sir, move your feet now,
or I'll pick you up and carry you.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.616
[Mike] Phoenix is leaving the nest.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.206
Come on.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.132
Trey, thank you
for taking the kids on this trip.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.847
When you get this message,
tell them I called.

09:18.975 --> 09:22.058
I'll try again before they go to bed.
Thanks again.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.803
Mike.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.441
[indistinct chatter]

09:26.566 --> 09:29.183
-[Tom] General, what've you got?
-[Covell] Since news of the dirty bomb,

09:29.319 --> 09:32.937
East Hun Chiu has redeployed a large
portion of its troops from the DMZ,

09:33.073 --> 09:34.438
dispersing them to its borders.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.942
-They're protecting their coastline.
-Against possible invasion.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.786
We've also detected movement
of mobile missile batteries

09:40.914 --> 09:43.872
-away from West Hun Chiu.
-Can they reach American shores?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.583
[Covell] Their long-range missiles
have the capacity, Madam Vice President.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.543
We just aren't sure what the payload will be.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.003
They won't do anything
as long as Chairman Kim's here.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.668
He stays till we find the bomb.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.008
-We should go.
-Thank you.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.384
-[Tom] Where's Seth?
-Standing by.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.054
You need to decide what
to tell the public and when.

10:03.186 --> 10:06.554
Circumstantial evidence of
a threat doesn't require disclosure.

10:06.689 --> 10:10.307
No, but hunkering in a bunker
with your cabinet and senior staff

10:10.443 --> 10:13.561
-might interest Americans.
-This wasn't my choice.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.983
It was demanded by the Secret Service.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.653
And if we let the terrorist know
he's been discovered,

10:18.785 --> 10:20.241
he'll likely detonate the bomb early.

10:20.370 --> 10:24.489
If we follow this path, we could
stop this without any loss of life.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.865
Either way you cut it, sir,
it's a calculated risk.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.867
A risk I'm willing to take.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.836
-Tell Seth to run interference.
-Yes, sir.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.925
Huh. Dying of radiation poisoning
interferes with my grand plan.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.670
-Which is?
-Living to 130.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.552
The president has tabled his
meeting with House leadership

10:42.684 --> 10:44.470
to talk about the energy bill
until next week.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.933
Wasn't an agreement struck?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.724
The White House wanted more time
to dot all the I's.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.097
The schedule changed.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.519
The president will not attend

10:51.651 --> 10:54.518
tonight's performance of Richard 11
at the Kennedy Center.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.110
Why not?

10:56.239 --> 10:58.731
Uh, I guess he just likes plays in which

10:58.867 --> 11:01.404
the head of state
isn't deposed or murdered.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.118
-[all laugh]
-[Seth] Yeah.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.487
| noticed the Speaker canceled
his weekly radio address.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.364
| don't work for the Speaker.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.288
And the FAA logs show
the Speaker's in Michigan.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.127
But Congress is still in session.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.791
Seems something's going around.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.293
| only talk
about the president's schedule.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.884
You can reach out to the Speaker's office
to talk about his.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.004
-More soon, everybody. Thanks.
-[reporters clamoring]

11:23.099 --> 11:24.806
-[Tom] Hey.
-Hey...

11:24.934 --> 11:26.345
-How you doing?
-[Andrea sighs]

11:27.103 --> 11:30.095
I'm terrified my last meal
is gonna be a stale bear claw.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.892
It won't be. This is precautionary.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.690
Tom, they won't even let me tell my mom
what's going on.

11:34.819 --> 11:38.778
The moratorium applies to all of us
till this is under control.

11:38.907 --> 11:39.863
[Kendra] Mr. President.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.653
This is the White House counsel,
Kendra Daynes.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.992
-Nice to meet you, Dr. Frost.
-Yes, you as well.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.785
You helped us find the bomb.
Now help us find the bomber.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.749
There's a difference
between crunching metadata

11:51.878 --> 11:55.041
to find missing nuclear waste
and hunting someone down.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.413
I'm aware of that.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.588
Then you're also aware I'm gonna need
access to private information.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.337
Information that's
constitutionally protected.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.635
I've acquired a FISA warrant for you to probe

12:05.767 --> 12:10.557
whatever confidential or proprietary databases
you need to help locate the bomber.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.641
We don't have a lot of time.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.854
Hey. I came to grab a few things.
Chop-chop.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.153
| need to finish this press release,
send it to the word processing pool.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.026
Fine, you tempt fate.
I'm going back down.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.494
Give me 30 seconds.
I'll be right there.

12:31.209 --> 12:34.668
Does it bother you that all the folks up here
could be incinerated, but we won't?

12:35.505 --> 12:36.836
It does now.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.172
Culling of the herd.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.798
If we're down there long enough,
we'll be culled, too.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.548
Food and water will eventually grow scarce.
The weak will be eaten.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.678
Most of us will succumb to microbes
before then. It's an awful way to die.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.396
Huh. A swift end might be preferable.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.809
Go ahead. I'll see you down there.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.061
Suit yourself.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.655
-Hey, do you mind?
-Go for it.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.490
[breathes deeply]

13:09.622 --> 13:10.862
[knock at door]

13:10.999 --> 13:12.910
[Seth] I know you took the bat, Lyor.
It's fine.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.874
You got a second?

13:16.087 --> 13:18.374
-Half a second. What's up?
-[Simon] Something interesting.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.586
The president's incommunicado,
so I was reassigned to the EEOB.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.177
Know who else cleared her decks today?
The VP.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.761
None of that is interesting.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.672
Well, this might be.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.221
A source saw Darby in the East Wing
a few hours ago. So I played a hunch.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.434
Rest of the cabinet...

13:33.563 --> 13:34.849
Everyone's suddenly off the grid.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.392
Do you have a question?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.269
Why is the nation's command structure

13:38.401 --> 13:40.267
secretly meeting the president
at the White House?

13:40.403 --> 13:43.612
-I can neither confirm nor deny that.
-You just did.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.980
This is newsworthy, Seth.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.357
Along with the fact
that the Speaker's 500 miles away.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.568
You'll find out how newsworthy

13:49.704 --> 13:52.241
if you don't get back to me
before the end of the hour.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.869
Frost gave us a lead.
An ex-con named Arturo Rojas.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.747
He was posting under different handles
on dark web forums

14:01.883 --> 14:02.998
in support of East Hun Chiu.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.795
Guess what he did time for?

14:04.927 --> 14:07.669
-Explosives.
-Six years at Hazelton.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.048
He took a flight to Dulles from Miami
two days ago and went off the grid.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.720
He got reason to be here?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.354
No contacts. No family.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.471
He rented a van at the airport,
hasn't returned it yet.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.723
We have an APB out
for him and the vehicle.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.102
[cell phone ringing] I'll follow up.
That's Blakey calling from the hospital.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.363
Yeah, I'll hold.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.604
-[cell phone beeps]
-How's Joon?

14:26.616 --> 14:30.484
[exhales] Better than we thought.
He ingested baking powder, Hannah.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.735
What?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.453
He played us.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.244
And now, he's in the wind.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.951
[sighs]

14:40.088 --> 14:41.453
-All right, thanks.
-[cell phone beeps]

14:41.589 --> 14:43.830
Aaron? We have a big problem.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.347
-[Aaron] Sir.
-[Tom] What are we looking at?

14:52.475 --> 14:53.931
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Tom] Hold on.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.596
One at a time, one at a time.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.685
We have missing radioactive waste,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.976
a defector in the wind,
and still can't find the bomb.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.395
-Assuming it exists.
-Which looks more and more likely.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.770
We need to get ahead of this story
before the press to control the message.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.942
We control it by saying
there is no dirty bomb.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.360
-[Seth] Lie?
-You're a quick study.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.982
It's a public safety issue.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.453
We shouldn't admit there's a threat
until we can get our hands around it.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.698
We don't know how long that will take.
How long can we mislead this community?

15:17.834 --> 15:20.667
And there's misleading Congress.
The leadership will crucify you.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.627
I'm not lying to anyone.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.999
We can play this another way:
Address it without directly addressing it.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.710
A quick public appearance?

15:29.846 --> 15:30.881
Don't take any questions.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.801
They can't report an emergency
if it's business as usual.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.552
Mike?

15:36.269 --> 15:40.058
I'm sorry, sir, but until we ascertain the
precise scope of the threat, we keep you here.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.226
Mike, this is a balancing act.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.066
We have a potential new threat. Panic.
If this gets out...

15:46.279 --> 15:47.314
You can control my appearance.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.530
Make it as short as you want
as long as the press can clock it.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.532
Let me do my job.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.573
| can give you 5 minutes.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.163
That's all we need. The Interfaith
Coalition is already in the building.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.873
A photo op is the perfect cover.

16:00.001 --> 16:00.832
Madam Vice President?

16:01.502 --> 16:02.583
I'll stand by, sir.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.874
Let's do this.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.551
Phoenix is returning to the nest.

16:09.969 --> 16:14.133
In closing, I would like to thank
Rabbi Greenblatt, Cardinal Bender

16:14.265 --> 16:18.054
of the Interfaith Coalition
for taking time to discuss with me

16:18.186 --> 16:20.393
our campaign for religious tolerance.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.567
-You think he bought it?
-Oh, he has to, right?

16:31.699 --> 16:34.111
Facts on the ground say the president's
in the West Wing.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.031
-But you know who's not? Me.
-Who?

16:38.748 --> 16:40.705
-[Kendra] Hey, Emily.
-Hey.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.951
Your affidavit says you authorized Chuck
to use any means necessary

16:44.086 --> 16:46.123
including accessing private phone records

16:46.255 --> 16:47.416
-to learn the leaker's ID.
-Correct.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.415
Why didn't Chuck provide
a supporting affidavit?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.631
We were trying to stop the leak
of classified information.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.346
He did what I asked.
I'm responsible.

16:56.474 --> 16:59.762
Based on how he may have obtained
the phone records,

16:59.894 --> 17:01.430
this evidence is inadmissible.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.974
Admissibility's usually a question
for the special prosecutor, isn't it?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.814
Usually, yes. But I can't advise
the president to suggest one

17:06.943 --> 17:08.934
-based on what you've given me.
-Why not?

17:09.612 --> 17:13.606
Because Moss is a formidable adversary.
He's going to defend himself.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.482
So let him. We've got you.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.952
| appreciate that. But unfortunately,
he's got the Constitution.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.784
| say we put Moss on the defensive.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.248
We're in a bunker,
our boss is taking shots from all sides,

17:24.377 --> 17:27.915
-and we have a duty to protect him.
-We will. But let's do it the right way.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.458
Thank you.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.343
[Hannah] Why would Joon double-cross us

17:35.471 --> 17:38.463
after he gave us the location
of his father's nukes?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.924
[Chuck] Maybe he was
trying to earn our trust.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.885
Wait till our guard was down
before playing us.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.012
It seems like a really long con.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.526
And to what end?
We still don't know what he's up to.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.609
-Joon's girlfriend is on the I am now, too.
-What?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.319
She wasn't a high-value asset.

17:53.447 --> 17:55.279
She was staying with friends
in Silver Springs,

17:55.408 --> 17:57.490
went for a walk this morning, disappeared.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.450
Maybe they're not up to anything.
They just wanna be together.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.792
And cut the country out of the loop
that gave them sanctuary? I don't think so.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.332
-[computer beeping]
-Frost just sent me something.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.544
[typing]

18:15.011 --> 18:18.720
This is sat video from yesterday morning.
Maximum magnification.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.589
Just a blurry face in a van.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.639
Lyra's got
an advanced facial recognition feature.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.564
Arturo Rojas. Our bomber.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.188
[Chuck] Lyra cross-references every pixel
on the suspect's face

18:36.324 --> 18:39.862
with her databank of billions of images.
Comes up with an identity.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.406
-Hot damn.
-Did she give you an address?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.746
[Chuck] Actually, yeah.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.913
Lyra says the contours of the structure
match an abandoned building

18:49.045 --> 18:51.707
-at 2642 Belmont Southeast.
-[Hannah] Let's go.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.759
Our scanners detect
no radiological signature.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.177
You'll want to see this, though.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.600
[Hannah] Joon.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.219
-Flat on the ground!
-Agent Wells...

19:08.356 --> 19:11.519
Flat on the ground or I shoot you. Now!

19:20.076 --> 19:22.067
Mr. President, we've located Joon Kim, sir.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.740
-Did we get anything from him?
-They're still interrogating him.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.454
| want a full debrief when they finish.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.118
-Absolutely.
-Where are we at with the bomb?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.116
We're still chasing it down, sir.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.538
Okay, thank you.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.040
[sighs]

19:40.179 --> 19:41.544
[exhales sharply]

19:41.681 --> 19:43.888
You look like you need a distraction.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.058
[Darby chuckles]

19:47.186 --> 19:50.224
[Tom] You know what usually does the trick
for me? [sighs]

19:50.356 --> 19:52.017
Good old chess game.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.064
I'll let you in on a little secret.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.733
One of the many reasons I wanted you
as my vice president

19:59.865 --> 20:02.698
-was that I heard you played.
-[Darby] Mmm.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.574
The other reason you picked me is
because you knew you could beat me.

20:08.791 --> 20:09.952
[Tom] We'll see.

20:14.630 --> 20:18.669
You surprised me when you left the bunker
this morning, Mr. President.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.838
It kind of threw me.

20:20.970 --> 20:21.835
How so?

20:24.432 --> 20:29.017
When you went
to the photo op this morning,

20:29.145 --> 20:32.308
it meant I was
the designated survivor, right?

20:32.565 --> 20:33.851
Yes, that's correct.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.935
-I'm not ready to be president.
-I wasn't either.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.939
But apparently, a lack of preparedness
is not a disqualifier.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.657
What I meant, sir,

20:44.785 --> 20:48.028
is I don't think I want to be president.

20:48.998 --> 20:49.829
| know.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.656
I'm sorry?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.416
| know that you don't.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.372
That was one of the main reasons I picked you.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.048
Becoming president of the United States

21:01.177 --> 21:03.464
makes you the most powerful person
in the world.

21:04.847 --> 21:09.307
If you're overly ambitious,
it'll go to your head. Compromise you.

21:09.435 --> 21:14.054
But if you're sitting in that Oval Office
out of a sense of obligation,

21:14.190 --> 21:16.056
no one can question your priorities.

21:16.192 --> 21:19.901
-To the American people.
-That's right.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.485
They're who we serve.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.575
You've been served, too, Mr. President.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.654
Checkmate.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.538
[both chuckle]

21:32.666 --> 21:34.202
Two out of three.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.164
| told you. I don't know anything.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.254
No, you don't know anything.
You just faked a medical emergency

21:40.382 --> 21:42.544
to escape
because you were punking us, right?

21:42.676 --> 21:45.384
| wasn't a prisoner, so I didn't escape.

21:45.513 --> 21:48.505
Nice distinction, except it was obvious
you were trying to shake your minders.

21:48.641 --> 21:49.847
We have a theory about that.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.636
You hate your father, so you defect.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.056
Bring him to justice by telling us
where his nukes are.

21:54.188 --> 21:58.056
But you can never go home again
because Daddy will be there forever.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.058
Clinging to power is what he does.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.356
Unless someone like us takes him out.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.774
None of that is true.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.614
So you plant a dirty bomb,
knowing we're gonna blame him.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.858
And you know what? You were right.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.985
He does have the motive to scuttle the deal.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.954
And he did tell our president
he wanted to take revenge.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.075
Once we remove him,
you're the prince-in-waiting.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.202
Here's the problem, Joon.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.421
The evidence doesn't point to your father.
It points to you.

22:22.550 --> 22:26.418
[Blakey] Not sure what you did today.
Tying loose ends, paying the bomber?

22:26.554 --> 22:30.764
-But we know you're behind this.
-You are wrong about everything.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.976
-Where's your girlfriend?
- I don't know.

22:35.104 --> 22:37.971
-[Blakey] Why'd you run?
- I didn't. I wasn't.

22:38.107 --> 22:41.475
Why did we find you at the warehouse
the bomber visited yesterday?

22:44.655 --> 22:46.316
Tell us, damn it!

22:49.535 --> 22:51.242
I'm sorry. I can't.

22:51.871 --> 22:52.986
Wrong answer.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.336
Did I catch you a bad time?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.304
Nope. Just, uh, going out to get some lunch.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.344
Must be a hell of a lunch.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.433
You shouldn't be wandering around
the White House like this.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.849
Accessibility has never been a problem.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.188
Seems like today's different
in a lot of ways.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.479
Beginning with the fact
that you're lying to the press corps.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.023
I've never said anything to the press
that wasn't true.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.614
If you didn't lie, you walked the line.
But I can read the tea leaves.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.029
Obfuscation.
Administration unavailability.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.573
Everything points to a crisis. A threat.

23:34.705 --> 23:37.197
Hmm. If you've got the story,
you should go to press.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.165
| can't, not without corroboration.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.534
Maybe I'm not giving that to you for a reason.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.005
You threw me a bone, Seth.
A big one.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.919
But that doesn't square things.
I'll still pursue this.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.008
What bone?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.173
The anonymous email.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.843
You might wanna stop playing dumb.
You can't sell it.

23:59.521 --> 24:00.511
[computer beeping]

24:02.566 --> 24:03.522
[typing]

24:05.694 --> 24:07.196
-Hey.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.904
How's it going?

24:12.826 --> 24:14.988
Lyra's searching for the bomber now.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.737
May I ask you a question?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.580
Sure.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.373
| was on my way home from Camp David
when I got your summons.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.045
Why ask me to come here?

24:29.551 --> 24:30.586
Because you're brilliant.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.383
Everybody's talking about
this new platform you've developed.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.886
| honestly believed you could help.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.264
[computer beeps]

24:43.190 --> 24:44.021
[Andrea] All right...

24:44.858 --> 24:49.523
Lyra's pinpointed Rojas's location based
on his web searches and ATM withdrawal.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.608
| got it.

24:53.409 --> 24:54.399
The Brandt metro.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.159
Thousands of commuters. Mike!

24:57.287 --> 24:59.415
-Get me Aaron.
-[Mike] Yes, sir.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.368
[man] Move! Move! Let's go!

25:05.504 --> 25:07.620
[Hannah] Let's get everyone
from this station evacuated.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.747
Everyone out of this area. Let's move.

25:09.883 --> 25:11.135
[Blakey] Move!

25:11.260 --> 25:13.251
[indistinct chatter]

25:13.387 --> 25:15.048
[Hannah] Go, go, go!

25:20.519 --> 25:22.931
[bomb tech] I think I got something.
We should get the robot.

25:23.772 --> 25:24.887
No, we don't have time.

25:25.774 --> 25:26.730
You good?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.202
[bomb tech exhales]

25:45.419 --> 25:48.878
-[bomb beeping]
-[bomb tech] We got a live one.

25:49.006 --> 25:51.589
-Can you defuse it?
-I'm going to try.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.106
Nice job.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.529
Yeah. Here's the weird thing.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.119
It's basically just a pipe bomb.
It's amateur stuff.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.659
-What about the radioactive material?
-Uh...

26:25.292 --> 26:27.033
[clicking]

26:28.504 --> 26:29.835
212 CPMs.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.208
Too low to cause biological damage.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.207
Doesn't match the reading we were getting
from the containers.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.836
-We're missing radioactive waste?
-Cesium is tricky to move.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.633
There could have been spillage
in transport of radioactive material.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.803
Especially if our bomber wasn't a pro.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.221
Where are we with the bombmaker?

26:44.353 --> 26:46.970
Still in the wind. We'll find him.
Get him to identify Joon Kim.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.560
-Keep me posted.
-Yes, sir.

26:52.694 --> 26:53.525
Hannah?

26:59.034 --> 27:00.820
| think we've got some unfinished business.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.409
That's one way to put it.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.697
| understand how things might have looked
from your vantage point,

27:05.833 --> 27:08.165
like I was on some sort of crusade
to get the Kirkmans.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.751
-You were.
-Because I thought something was there.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.998
That's the thing about crusades, John.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.375
They do start with the best intentions,

27:17.511 --> 27:20.253
then all you're left with
is collateral damage.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.339
It was never personal.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.432
-Tell the president that.
-I've tried.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.518
Try again.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.887
The least you owe him is a little persistence.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.197
"Dirty bomb" is an inaccurate description.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.568
This was actually a pipe bomb
with trace radioactive elements.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.866
Not enough to cause
any significant environmental

27:45.998 --> 27:48.205
or biological damage
even if it had detonated.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.956
Do we have a suspect?

27:50.085 --> 27:53.953
[Seth] Yes, in custody,
and we are searching for an accomplice.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.922
East Hun Chiu claimed it executed
the peace accords under duress.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.336
That makes them more likely suspects?

27:58.468 --> 28:00.596
No, we have no evidence of that...
[continues indistinctly]

28:00.721 --> 28:02.928
What are you wearing?

28:03.056 --> 28:06.139
Oh, it detects ionizing radiation.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.134
| also have it in red and blue.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.261
Hmm. For the fashionable hypochondriac.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.899
No, for the surviving one.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.480
[reporters clamoring]

28:13.609 --> 28:16.317
What about reports that
President Moss is being investigated

28:16.445 --> 28:19.358
for leaking classified information
during the Hun Chiu negotiations?

28:19.489 --> 28:20.775
| have no comment.

28:20.908 --> 28:24.401
Or that President Moss is the source
of a number of leaks to different news outlets

28:24.536 --> 28:25.571
during the past three months?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.866
No comment.
That's all I have for now.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.239
-[reporters clamoring]
-[Seth] Stay tuned for more.

28:34.922 --> 28:38.040
-You tipped Simon Day off about Moss.
-What are you talking about?

28:38.175 --> 28:40.837
| said I couldn't recommend a
special prosecutor because I was concerned

28:40.969 --> 28:43.256
how the evidence
of Moss's misconduct was obtained.

28:43.388 --> 28:46.597
So you slipped it to a reporter
to neutralize my objections.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.389
Once the information's public,
there's no fruit of the poisonous tree.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.976
You laundered evidence.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.015
It's not that simple.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.890
Leaking to make a case against a leaker.
You don't see the irony?

28:56.026 --> 28:58.688
Moss has been undermining our president
for months.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.107
Icarus Astrotech.
The First Lady's subpoena.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.483
The ethics review. Hun Chiu negotiations.
He spilled it all.

29:04.618 --> 29:05.824
And I'm not defending him.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.695
I'm defending the rule of law.
The Fourth Amendment.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.821
You're missing the big picture here, Kendra.

29:10.958 --> 29:15.043
Our guy is out there bleeding
and he needs our help.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.628
If we get hemmed in
by procedural niceties--

29:17.756 --> 29:19.667
Hemmed in? Procedural niceties?

29:22.511 --> 29:25.219
| don't think I'm not the one
missing the big picture here.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.062
[knock at door]

29:35.983 --> 29:36.973
Mr. President?

29:37.109 --> 29:38.520
| only have a minute.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.434
[Foerstel] I understand.

29:41.697 --> 29:42.812
I'll be brief.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.996
| want to apologize, sir.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.073
Apologize for what?

29:54.876 --> 29:55.866
Everything.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.204
[exhales sharply]

30:01.550 --> 30:04.008
Mr. Director, at any time,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.719
did you behave in a manner
that you thought was inconsistent

30:06.847 --> 30:08.929
with what you thought
was best for this country?

30:11.727 --> 30:12.637
No, sir.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.055
And during your investigation,

30:14.187 --> 30:16.770
you believed you followed
a thread of wrongdoing

30:16.898 --> 30:18.229
that led to the White House?

30:19.192 --> 30:22.025
-Yes, sir.
-Then you have nothing to apologize for.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.395
You were doing your job.
You did your best.

30:25.073 --> 30:28.566
[scoffs] My best put me in conflict
with my commander-in-chief.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.284
[scoffs]

30:31.913 --> 30:36.248
Come hell or high water, both of our jobs
have similar requirements.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.581
And I expect you to continue doing yours.

30:41.423 --> 30:42.413
Yes, sir.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.925
The press is monitoring my guys,
watching them work.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.761
| should get back there and fly the flag.

30:48.889 --> 30:51.551
-Reassure the public.
-Carry on.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.185
Thank you, sir.

30:55.145 --> 30:56.351
[sighs]

30:57.356 --> 30:59.643
The press has tripped
to our Moss investigation.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.061
How the hell did that happen?

31:01.193 --> 31:03.901
-It doesn't matter. We need a response.
-[sighs] I agree.

31:04.029 --> 31:05.986
[Lyor] But there's
a more important matter to attend to.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.107
We found a radioactive bomb.
We defused it.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.451
Seth did a good job at downplaying it,
but the public's still on edge.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.156
Should I address the nation?

31:14.289 --> 31:16.621
No. They don't need to hear you,
they need to see you.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.582
Out and about. Reassuring them.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.542
Let's do it.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.711
[indistinct chatter]

31:27.636 --> 31:29.172
[Tom] Thank you for doing this.

31:29.304 --> 31:33.593
Seeing the president stepping out
with a prominent person like yourself

31:33.725 --> 31:35.307
is very notable.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.927
No problem.
I'm a sucker for a free lunch.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.851
I'll have a hot dog. And you?

31:41.983 --> 31:43.599
May |7?

31:43.735 --> 31:44.566
Sure.

31:44.694 --> 31:45.855
Two original half-smokes,

31:45.987 --> 31:48.115
two chili bowls,
sweet potato fries with cheese,

31:48.240 --> 31:50.322
and two strawberry banana shakes, please.

31:50.450 --> 31:55.035
-Wow. What just happened?
-You're riding with the king.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.244
[Tom chuckles]

31:56.373 --> 32:00.037
[Blakey] We got video of Rojas at a Grub-N-go
in Alexandria yesterday morning.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.875
[Hannah] But not after?

32:02.003 --> 32:02.868
Uh, guys.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.382
We know he left his van at Brandt station.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.545
DC Metro video doesn't show him
getting on the subway.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.884
-Guys.
-Could have had a confederate pick him up.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.594
-[Chuck] Guys...
-Or hailed a taxi.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.464
[Blakey] He has no accounts
with ride-sharing services.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.133
Guys!

32:20.188 --> 32:23.397
Sorry. I was able to hack into the van's GPS.

32:23.525 --> 32:24.936
| thought the GPS was off.

32:25.068 --> 32:28.732
It was, but this GPS records
the car's movements.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.901
[computer beeping]

32:31.032 --> 32:32.113
Spyware.

32:32.242 --> 32:33.198
Yeah.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.533
All rental companies are using it
to prevent car theft.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.199
All I had to do was hack into it.

32:38.331 --> 32:43.371
Rojas made multiple stops at one location
before abandoning the van at the metro.

32:43.503 --> 32:46.746
2263 Briarview Northeast.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.214
-An industrial facility in Eckington.
-Nice job.

32:53.346 --> 32:54.336
Suck it, Lyra.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.062
[Hannah] Put your hands up!

33:09.154 --> 33:10.019
Hands!

33:25.170 --> 33:27.787
-Arturo Rojas.
-That's radiation poisoning.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.415
[Blakey] There wasn't enough cesium
in that bomb to cause this.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.922
Lots of high-end
bomb-making equipment here.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.139
Blast caps. Digital fuses.
Weapons-grade ammonium nitrate.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.383
None of that stuff was in that contraption.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.604
It was a decoy.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.442
[Foerstel] We got lucky today.
How I like to look at it is...

33:51.071 --> 33:53.153
-[cell phone ringing]
-Excuse me.

33:53.281 --> 33:54.897
-Foerstel.
-[Hannah] John, it's a decoy.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.320
The van, the bomb.
There's another one!

33:57.452 --> 34:00.114
-Hannah, slow down.
-They wanted camera crews,

34:00.247 --> 34:03.330
us to have our guard down,
a big civilian target.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.574
-It's in the subway.
-Oh, my God.

34:05.710 --> 34:06.541
The subway...

34:06.670 --> 34:08.206
I've still got men down there!

34:08.338 --> 34:09.418
[shouting] Everybody, back!

34:09.547 --> 34:11.789
Get back! Get everybody back!

34:13.467 --> 34:15.675
[people shouting]

34:16.513 --> 34:17.799
John?

34:21.643 --> 34:22.599
John?

34:44.165 --> 34:45.326
[Seth] Mr. President.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.995
[Tom sighs]

34:53.842 --> 34:55.674
My fellow Americans,

34:55.802 --> 34:57.839
today at 7:43 p.m.,

34:57.971 --> 35:02.340
a dirty bomb was detonated at the Brandt
metro station in our nation's capital.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.476
Because of the heroic work of the FBI,

35:05.604 --> 35:08.892
the Department of Homeland Security
and the Capitol Police,

35:09.024 --> 35:11.015
there were no civilian casualties.

35:11.151 --> 35:14.519
And while the Brandt metro station will
be closed for the foreseeable future,

35:14.654 --> 35:17.567
radioactive waste did not escape.

35:17.699 --> 35:20.031
And there's no ongoing danger to the public.

35:21.703 --> 35:24.320
But it is with a heavy heart
that I inform you

35:24.456 --> 35:29.246
that six federal agents gave their lives
to protect us from this terrible attack,

35:30.211 --> 35:33.124
including John Foerstel,
the director of the FBI.

35:34.132 --> 35:38.672
I make a solemn promise to their families,
and the American people,

35:38.803 --> 35:41.386
that their sacrifices will not be in vain.

35:42.182 --> 35:45.595
We will hunt down the perpetrators
of this terrorist attack.

35:45.727 --> 35:47.559
And bring them to justice.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.099
Swiftly, and without mercy.

35:50.231 --> 35:55.397
God bless you. And God bless
these United States of America.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.326
[Seth] You're clear.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.321
| want answers now.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.244
-You're lying, you son of a bitch!
-I'm not.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.372
Neither am I when I promise you
that you will be charged

36:16.508 --> 36:19.091
with the premeditated murder
of six federal agents!

36:19.219 --> 36:21.711
That carries a death sentence,
which you'll get.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.099
I'll be there when they strap you
to that gurney,

36:24.224 --> 36:26.807
| will watch when they put that needle
in your arm!

36:26.935 --> 36:28.767
| swear I didn't do anything!

36:28.895 --> 36:32.433
This is your last chance.
Or you're going to die.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.733
Let's go.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.410
They told me they'd kill her
if I said anything!

36:44.202 --> 36:45.317
Who did?

36:46.287 --> 36:47.368
| don't know.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.579
Were you working with Arturo Rojas?

36:49.708 --> 36:51.073
[sobbing] I never met him.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.747
| just got email yesterday
saying Jung-Min had been taken.

36:55.422 --> 36:59.256
A man in baseball cap told me what to do.
| didn't get a good look at his face.

36:59.384 --> 37:00.624
Where did you meet him?

37:00.760 --> 37:01.750
[exhales sharply]

37:02.804 --> 37:05.796
A park on Wisconsin and 24th.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.145
That's across from the Kunami Embassy.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.850
[Tom] Kunami?

37:17.986 --> 37:21.695
We tracked payments to Arturo Rojas
from a Kunami government account.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.030
We found evidence
he visited the Baltimore Harbor

37:24.159 --> 37:26.366
and spiked that Hun Chiu
shipping container with cesium.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.531
The warehouse Joon Kim was found in

37:28.663 --> 37:30.745
was rented by
a Kunami government shell company.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.115
Just like the storage unit Rojas was using.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.334
Wait a second,
Kunami set up Chairman Kim's son?

37:36.463 --> 37:37.953
Everything points to that, sir.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.875
His girlfriend was tied up
in an abandoned apartment...

37:40.008 --> 37:43.296
Which was rented
by a Kunami government shell company.

37:43.428 --> 37:46.011
Tell the Kunami ambassador
to be here in 15 minutes.

37:46.139 --> 37:47.345
Yes, sir.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.012
Mr. Ambassador, you've got exactly
five minutes to explain yourself.

37:55.148 --> 37:58.516
When your time is up, you, sir, will have
decided your country's fate.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.734
The first explanation owed is to me.
What is this about?

38:01.863 --> 38:06.198
We have evidence your country was behind
the bombing that killed six Americans.

38:06.326 --> 38:09.739
-Six federal agents!
-That is an outrageous allegation.

38:09.871 --> 38:13.330
Bank transfers.
From Kunami state accounts to the bomber.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.574
Titles to facilities
in the name of a corporation

38:15.710 --> 38:17.542
that traces back to Kunami state actors.

38:17.670 --> 38:18.796
-Fabrications.
-[Tom] No, sir!

38:18.922 --> 38:20.162
Try again!

38:21.216 --> 38:24.083
Mr. President,
why would my government do this?

38:24.219 --> 38:27.211
The same reason your government
does anything. Money.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.588
$16 billion in black market weapons

38:29.724 --> 38:31.840
illegally smuggled
into East Hun Chiu this year alone.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.719
An income at jeopardy if the Hun Chius are
at peace, which is why you want them at war.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.768
You tried to make it look like East Hun Chiu
was sabotaging the peace deal

38:38.900 --> 38:40.390
by attacking the country that brokered it.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.110
You're right,
$16 billion is a lot of money.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.230
Not enough for the emir
to risk war against the US.

38:46.366 --> 38:50.485
You've already done that.
Or have you forgotten about the USS Verona?

38:50.620 --> 38:53.078
A diplomatic misunderstanding.
You got your sailors back.

38:53.206 --> 38:55.994
At the point of a spear!
Your country had no choice.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.627
Mr. President...

38:58.336 --> 39:01.454
| know relations between our countries
have been strained.

39:01.589 --> 39:06.299
And we have a lot of differences.
But I swear to you, we did not do this.

39:06.427 --> 39:09.135
Then explain this evidence. Now!

39:10.682 --> 39:12.264
| can't. [sighs]

39:13.268 --> 39:15.054
Not yet, but give me time--

39:15.186 --> 39:19.601
I'm sorry, but you are out of time
and so is your emir. Goodbye.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.984
Get me Secretary Wooster
and the Joint Chiefs now.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.069
[Emily] Yes, sir.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.194
[indistinct chatter over PA]

39:35.957 --> 39:38.164
-What've we got?
-[Wooster] General?

39:38.293 --> 39:41.126
The first salvo will take out their
missile installations and airfields.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.120
The second targets bridges and oil fields.

39:43.256 --> 39:45.247
Secretary Krantz is consulting with NATO.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.090
Trying to build a consensus
for a military policy--

39:47.218 --> 39:49.050
We don't need a consensus.
We were attacked.

39:49.178 --> 39:51.636
But moving without advising our allies...

39:51.764 --> 39:55.257
Does anyone deny
our right to defend ourselves?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.349
No, sir.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.889
Then why get bogged down
in diplomatic discussion?

39:59.022 --> 40:00.308
[Lyor] Sir...

40:00.440 --> 40:02.772
At a minimum, we should reach out
to congressional leadership.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.608
Why? What good would that do?

40:04.736 --> 40:08.024
More meetings, further delays
and an insistence on building a coalition.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.614
Mr. President, Lyor's right.
There's a protocol here.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.860
We were attacked!
The protocol is strike back!

40:13.995 --> 40:17.909
Correct, sir.
The question is how and when we retaliate.

40:18.041 --> 40:22.535
After the Capitol was bombed,
it took 18 months to find Patrick Lloyd.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.708
Eighteen months
where the dead had no justice.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.626
Because we didn't know
where the perpetrator was.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.500
We know where the emir is!

40:29.636 --> 40:32.173
Sitting in his palace, taunting us.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.888
If I balk and fail to strike
given what I know,

40:35.016 --> 40:37.223
| am not worthy of my office.

40:37.352 --> 40:39.184
And neither are any of you.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.858
-At your command, sir.
-Do it.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.778
-Engage.
-[man] Yes, sir. Engage.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.319
[indistinct chatter over PA]
