00:13.000 --> 00:18.279
<i>Riddle me this: When is</i>
<i>a door not a door?</i>

00:18.280 --> 00:20.519
<i>It feels like drowning, doesn't it?</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:26.879
<i>When the answer is at the edge of your</i>
<i>cortex, but you can't seem to grasp it.</i>

00:26.880 --> 00:28.759
<i>You're trying my patience.</i>

00:28.760 --> 00:30.159
<i>The answer?</i>

00:30.160 --> 00:32.959
When it's ajar.

00:32.960 --> 00:38.764
Here's an easy one. What runs
around a city but never moves?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.926
No? A wall.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.963
<i>What do you want, Nigma?</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:48.439
I'm in charge, so I'll
ask the questions.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.999
Try to keep up, won't you?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.039
Riddle me this: What belongs to you
but others use it more than you do?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.359
<i>Your name.</i>

00:56.360 --> 00:57.919
Huh?

00:57.920 --> 00:59.719
- You've heard that one.
- No.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.886
I have Google like the
rest of the world.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.759
<i>Why do you talk to</i>
<i>me like this, Waller?</i>

01:06.760 --> 01:11.519
Simple. I needed to keep you babbling
long enough to pinpoint your position.

01:11.520 --> 01:14.002
My... what?

01:19.800 --> 01:22.726
Hands in the air where
we can see them.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.559
<i>Take him out.</i>

01:26.560 --> 01:28.803
Make it hurt.

01:31.320 --> 01:35.519
Riddle me this: Why didn't
I quit when I was ahead?

01:40.120 --> 01:41.885
What is it? Report.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.399
The Riddler is mine.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.768
Switch to night vision.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.008
Secure the perimeter.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.719
Holy crap, it's Batman.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.891
Unh.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.439
I know you helped him, Nigma.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.605
Tell me where it is.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.079
I'm invoking priority
level ultraviolet.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.919
Assemble Task Force X.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.051
We have another suicide mission.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.241
Ugh.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.279
Strewth, I got the hangover,
but I don't recall the party.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.079
Aah, crap, not this again.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.479
You too?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.919
It's like a bloody
recurring nightmare.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.519
Looks like we got rookies.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.239
Who are you people?

07:10.240 --> 07:12.319
And why am I in uniform?

07:12.320 --> 07:15.359
No bars, no chains.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.079
Time for meat.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.439
You try it, fish-fingers, and I'll
show you the meaning of cold-blooded.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.399
You're feisty.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.399
Everybody, shut up.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.199
I've been here before.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.679
Ah!

07:38.680 --> 07:40.159
I am leaving.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.483
Stop.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.765
Sit down.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.199
I'm Amanda Waller.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.679
I'm here to indoctrinate you
convicts into our special forces.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.889
Pass.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.159
I killed to keep degenerates
off the streets.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.159
I won't work alongside them.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.439
Fresh air and time off my sentence?

08:08.440 --> 08:11.199
Feel free to keep
calling me up, love.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.999
Task Force X is an off-the-books
government strike team...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.759
made up of convicts with
no hope for release...

08:17.760 --> 08:22.802
serving as expendable agents
for impossible missions.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.279
Succeed and I'll shave
time off your sentences.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.966
If we don't?

08:29.280 --> 08:30.559
You'll be dead.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.159
Any other stupid questions?

08:33.159 --> 08:36.359
Yeah, what's in my neck? A tracker?

08:36.360 --> 08:40.318
Yes. And a powerful
nanotech explosive.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.599
Run away, get yourself
captured, disobey an order...

08:44.600 --> 08:51.406
hell, give me a right answer too slowly,
and I'll blow your head clean off.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.483
You lie.

08:55.920 --> 09:00.325
You would not take all of
this trouble just to kill us.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.927
Try me.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.922
Anyone else?

09:33.440 --> 09:36.127
I didn't think so.

09:36.280 --> 09:40.401
What's so dangerous this time that
you had to send in the newbies?

09:40.920 --> 09:44.799
You're going to break
into Arkham Asylum.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.639
- That's insane.
- Don't want much?

09:46.640 --> 09:48.959
- Screw that.
- I don't do freaky-deakies.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.759
Yahtzee!

09:50.760 --> 09:52.924
How do we start?

09:53.600 --> 09:56.799
Oh. I like you, cowboy.

09:56.800 --> 10:02.119
You're loco and me likey
your loco-motion.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.839
- Aah!
- What's the plan?

10:03.840 --> 10:08.119
A week ago, while in my employ,
a lowlife calling himself the Riddler...

10:08.120 --> 10:10.999
managed to gain access
to my computer system.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.439
He downloaded a file containing
the identities and histories...

10:14.440 --> 10:19.079
of every current, past and potential
member of the suicide squad.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.919
Including ours.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.119
That's right.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.239
He's threatening to release
them all on the Internet.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.679
You're going to get it back.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.719
Riddler's got one copy and it's
on a thumb drive in his cane...

10:31.720 --> 10:35.319
which is currently locked away
in the Arkham property room.

10:35.320 --> 10:40.199
In the intensive treatment building, right
under the solitary confinement cells.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.639
Good times.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.159
So we get someone inside.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.087
Is it me? Can it be me? Dibs!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.039
She's a wild card.

10:49.040 --> 10:51.599
Harley Quinn has an
encyclopedic knowledge...

10:51.600 --> 10:54.039
of Arkham's layout
and its logistics.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.319
She gonna be okay that
close to the Joker?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.999
I'm fine. We're done.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.679
He's a jerk.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.809
Whatever.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.321
Well, I'm convinced.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.599
You'll be snuck into Gotham.

11:09.600 --> 11:13.482
You'll rendezvous with a power broker
who will set you up for the break-in.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.479
This is as off-the-grid as it gets, so
let's keep the body count to a minimum.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.962
Deadshot, rubber bullets only.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.643
What about The Bat?

11:27.240 --> 11:29.719
He has his hands full
on another case.

11:29.720 --> 11:34.489
In fact, we work it right, we might
be able to take advantage of him.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.639
Waller.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.041
What, Lawton?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.719
Play fair and I'll shoot straight.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.090
Jerk me around and I'll kill you.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.482
Be a good convict, Lawton.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.919
Don't make me blow you up.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.679
I'm clear.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.959
Gas them.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.930
What them?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.884
Huh.

12:13.560 --> 12:16.159
I'm getting tired of this trick.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.919
You and me both, cowboy.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.839
Maybe when we get into Gotham,
I can show you around.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.919
I know some tight places.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.799
- Not interested.
- Hmph.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.239
I told you, Harley.

12:30.240 --> 12:34.279
If you're giving it out,
heave a chunk my way, eh?

12:34.280 --> 12:36.199
Ah. You wish.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.679
Shake your boomer-wang
at the shark guy.

12:38.680 --> 12:42.243
- Dc it, and I'll bite it off.
- Ha, ha.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.446
Come on, Harl. For old time's sake?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.119
Are we gonna have a
problem this time around?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.799
I think we might, mate.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.719
No.

12:56.720 --> 12:57.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.719
I don't trust vermin.

12:59.720 --> 13:03.399
Honorless, rudderless,
undisciplined.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.719
They'll never find your body.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.044
Oh, ninjas are awesome.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.211
You think that means we're there?

13:30.280 --> 13:33.639
I hate heights!

13:42.720 --> 13:44.439
Whoo!

13:44.440 --> 13:45.759
We're not gonna make it.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.039
Waller, please!

13:51.240 --> 13:55.599
<i>Remember this feeling, convicts.</i>
<i>I hold your lives in my hands.</i>

13:55.600 --> 13:57.679
You crazy bitch.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.119
Open the damn chutes.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.851
Do it. Now!

14:08.240 --> 14:10.961
Unh. Aah!

14:29.320 --> 14:30.759
Good one.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.924
Good shark.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.405
Gross.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.730
Where's Harley?

14:39.560 --> 14:43.681
Don't worry, I fell on my head.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.969
Great. How do we get to
the rendezvous unseen?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.999
A few more miles.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.999
Keep moving then.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.399
Aah! This is flipping bonkers.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.959
Sloshing through sewage so a guy
dressed like a bat won't spot us?

15:13.960 --> 15:18.445
You wanna head topside,
slick, be my guest.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.049
No, we're practically there.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.764
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.565
Cobblepot.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.359
We're closed. Private party.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.519
Yeah, we're the private party.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.479
This way. He's waiting on you.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.479
Your guests have
arrived, Mr. Cobblepot.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.530
Right, right. Come in.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.199
Welcome to the Iceberg Lounge.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.126
I'm just finishing my supper.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.523
Pardon me, Mr. Cobblepot.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.079
Lawton? Oh, I never pegged
Deadshot for a team player.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.006
Oh, things are tough all over, sir.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.044
That's a good one. Ha, ha.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.439
This man is the best
assassin I've ever seen.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.159
And I only work with the best.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.279
I aim to please, Mr. Cobblepot.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.839
I was told you can
get us into Arkham?

16:38.840 --> 16:40.279
I can indeed.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.519
I've made arrangements to sneak
you into the crazy farm.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.799
Follow them to...

16:44.800 --> 16:46.119
You.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.285
Clown!

16:49.560 --> 16:53.079
You're not still mad about
that truck, are you, Pengy?

16:54.520 --> 16:57.439
Wah-wah.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.279
It feels like you are.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.959
You cost me money, funny girl.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.709
Her and her looney boyfriend
nicked my truck of cigarettes

17:05.734 --> 17:09.325
and drove it into the river.
Just for a laugh.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.878
Does it matter that Mr. J and
I aren't together anymore?

17:12.880 --> 17:15.319
Nobody steals from
me and walks away.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.290
It's bad business, love.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.519
You're right, you should kill her.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.279
Hell, I'll kill her for you.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.118
Aw, come on.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.887
Except you know what else
is bad for business, sir?

17:29.280 --> 17:32.319
Double-crossing your clients.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.891
And I would hate for folks to say
Mr. Cobblepot takes your money

17:35.917 --> 17:38.573
and kills your operatives.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.441
Get her out of my sight, Lawton.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.879
There's your files.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.318
Memorize the contents.

17:48.319 --> 17:50.679
You can grab some shuteye
in the rooms above.

17:50.680 --> 17:54.439
You deploy tomorrow night
under the cover of darkness...

17:54.440 --> 17:59.519
and then I never want to see
any of you on my turf again.

17:59.520 --> 18:02.924
Now get the hell out of here.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.719
Ever the charmer, ain't you?

18:06.720 --> 18:08.610
Bite me, Boomer.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.081
Ah. Oi, Lawton.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.999
Nice shave, mate.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.839
We got off on the wrong foot
at the start of this mission.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.730
Hoist a pint with us.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.919
Can't. It's a school night.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.159
Ehh, suit yourself.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.483
How about a friendly
game of darts, then?

19:26.320 --> 19:28.051
Lucky shot.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.679
Right. Let's see you do it.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.923
Yeah! Come on!

19:36.160 --> 19:37.639
Sorry, mate.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.008
Looks like that one
took a bad bounce.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.811
Oh!

19:47.520 --> 19:51.208
Let's call it even, mate.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.759
<i>Louise? It's Amanda.</i>

20:00.760 --> 20:03.319
<i>I have a special</i>
<i>assignment for you.</i>

20:03.320 --> 20:06.679
<i>Something I'd rather keep</i>
<i>between the two of us.</i>

20:06.680 --> 20:08.525
I'm listening.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.399
Welcome back.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.723
- Did you miss me?
- What do you want?

20:28.680 --> 20:33.881
I got an itch I thought you
could help me scratch, cowboy.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.919
Wow!

20:35.920 --> 20:38.846
Oh. Good start.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.720
Ah, what the hell.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.049
Yahtzee!

21:04.080 --> 21:05.639
Here's my stop.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.486
Wish me luck, cowboy.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.571
There's gotta be one
here somewhere.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.799
You know where he
put it, don't you?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.359
Uh-oh.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.171
Where is it, Harley?

21:33.840 --> 21:37.279
No idea what you're talking about.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.119
Answers.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.726
- Now.
- Ugh!

21:44.560 --> 21:46.644
Back off, Bats.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.004
<i>Where is it?</i>

22:04.080 --> 22:06.359
What's he talking about?

22:06.360 --> 22:09.759
Who knows what these wankers
get worked up about.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.079
<i>I don't know. I swear.</i>

22:13.080 --> 22:15.719
I'm not firing blind
against The Bat.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.279
Waller, what the devil's going on?

22:19.600 --> 22:22.959
<i>You don't get to call me up</i>
<i>and demand answers, Deadshot.</i>

22:22.960 --> 22:25.169
What are they talking about?

22:25.560 --> 22:28.799
<i>Joker stole a dirty bomb and</i>
<i>hid it somewhere in Gotham.</i>

22:28.800 --> 22:33.959
<i>Apparently it's large enough that the</i>
<i>radiation would kill half the population.</i>

22:33.960 --> 22:36.799
<i>Batman's torn the city</i>
<i>apart trying to find it.</i>

22:36.800 --> 22:39.806
<i>At one point he thought</i>
<i>Riddler might know.</i>

22:39.840 --> 22:42.959
The Joker has a dirty bomb?

22:42.960 --> 22:45.647
That gives me the chills.

22:46.480 --> 22:50.009
Ice puns? Really?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.639
Waller, this is crap.

22:52.640 --> 22:57.443
<i>I don't care, convict, do your job.</i>

22:58.040 --> 23:03.162
Honestly, B-man, I don't know
where Mr. J puts half of his stuff.

23:04.960 --> 23:09.445
I just wanted a Chatty Boo-Boo doll
before they went on sale tomorrow.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.241
Get her back to Arkham.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.159
Will do, Batman.

23:22.160 --> 23:25.040
Get in there, you nutty broad.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.484
Mwah.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.803
I'm in the middle of lunch, now I
gotta process this dizzy dame?

24:35.320 --> 24:38.087
Crazy, huh?

24:38.560 --> 24:41.964
Why don't I just toss her in
her old cell and come back?

24:42.520 --> 24:43.512
Yeah, right.

24:43.538 --> 24:47.479
I got, like, half a dozen new forms to
fill out before you can even come in.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.491
We've got 10 minutes
to plant the device.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.530
Where should I dump her?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.527
Put it through the x-ray machine.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.559
Heh. Don't get much
deader than that.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.689
This one's cold as ice.

25:30.040 --> 25:34.684
Hey, buddy, I got nothing in the
system about accepting a new body.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.562
Yeah. Ha, ha.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.679
It says, uh, "Not found."

26:05.680 --> 26:09.209
I came from inside. Run it again.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.399
No, somethings wrong.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.121
I'm gonna have to get security.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.599
The junction box is up
ahead so move your ass.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.799
- Harley?
- Huh!

26:23.800 --> 26:26.965
Is it really you?

26:27.640 --> 26:29.079
Shit.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.050
Don't screw this up.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.279
Aren't you even going
to say hello? Heh, heh.

26:37.080 --> 26:41.519
Aw, guys, you gotta see this.
Joker just spotted Harley.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.079
Keep walking.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.799
Tell him to shut up.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.759
Aw, I can tell you're still sore.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.359
At least the bruises
cleared up nicely.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.882
What's your hurry, Harl?

27:01.800 --> 27:03.439
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

27:05.520 --> 27:07.319
Damn it.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.563
Let's move.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.439
Maybe she'll kill him.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.683
I hate you, you bastard!

27:15.400 --> 27:16.679
I'll kill him!

27:16.680 --> 27:20.880
I'll kill him myself for
what he's done to me.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.069
Women. Am I right, officer?

27:28.095 --> 27:32.646
Can't live with them, can't
kick them out of a moving car.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.559
You know the rules, buddy.
I gotta phone it in.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.610
She's dead.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.159
How much trouble could she be?

27:48.160 --> 27:51.719
Nothing goes in or out of
Arkham without being OK'd.

27:51.720 --> 27:57.809
But give me a sec, I'll try to get
ahold of the watch commander.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.919
- Run it again.
- I've tried twice, sir.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.721
I can't lose this job because
your system is down.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.479
Come on, you amateurs.

28:23.520 --> 28:27.527
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sorry,
hon. Bulletproof.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.919
Even better.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.924
Pudding.

28:39.840 --> 28:44.519
Why, Harley, if I didn't know better,
I'd say you're trying to kill me.

28:44.520 --> 28:46.684
We're finished, you and me.

28:46.960 --> 28:51.079
I got someone new
now. Someone better.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.919
Oh, hell. This'll have to do.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.079
Never mind. Just came through.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.448
About time.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.319
Sorry, it's an old system.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.563
No problem.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.282
Let's see what goodies we've got.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.201
Oh, shit!

29:51.120 --> 29:53.329
How...? Oh!

29:55.400 --> 29:57.799
Aah! Me goalies.

29:57.800 --> 30:01.124
- That's payback, you dumb-ass.
- Unh.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.479
Walk it off, Captain Kangaroo.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.439
Come on, we're out of time.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.919
- New guy?
- That's right.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.051
You're not jealous, are you?

30:51.480 --> 30:53.405
That's him.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.679
I know you.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.639
We worked together once.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.611
No, wait, don't tell me,
don't tell me. Hmm...

31:02.000 --> 31:03.759
Deadhead, hmm?

31:03.760 --> 31:06.119
Buckshot? Ha, ha!

31:08.080 --> 31:10.479
Hmph. Aah!

31:10.480 --> 31:12.450
I got her.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.719
You can have her.

31:14.720 --> 31:19.039
Bet you buy your shirts
second-hand too. Ha!

31:35.080 --> 31:37.562
Sir, we've got an
explosion on Level E.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.599
He's still secure, sir.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.279
Is that room service?

31:41.280 --> 31:44.159
Tell them I never got my calzone.

31:44.160 --> 31:48.079
Good. I need every available
security down in the kitchen, stat.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.039
We're on yellow alert.

31:56.120 --> 31:59.569
- You're late.
- Ran into her ex. Grab hold.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.401
Put your back into it.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.559
Hey. Nobody's supposed
to be down there.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.919
We just snuck down
here for a little party.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.199
What kind of party?

32:20.920 --> 32:22.599
Crap, you're Harley Quinn!

32:22.600 --> 32:24.439
Don't move, you crazy bit...

32:43.720 --> 32:47.169
I hate Italian food.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.359
Has that kitchen
fire been contained?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.679
Yes, sir.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.484
<i>- Lawton.</i>
- What?

33:25.720 --> 33:28.479
<i>GPS has you in the</i>
<i>main security hub.</i>

33:28.480 --> 33:30.079
<i>What's going on?</i>

33:30.080 --> 33:31.559
We own it, that's what.

33:31.560 --> 33:32.879
Now we grab the cane.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.519
<i>Don't get too cocky, Lawton.</i>

33:34.520 --> 33:38.919
<i>You're at the point of no return.</i>
<i>You best keep that in mind.</i>

33:38.920 --> 33:42.079
That gas explosion put the whole
bloody asylum on yellow alert.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.439
If the security cameras
make us, we're toast.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.999
So shut down all the security cams.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.639
That's a surefire way
to alert The Bat.

33:49.640 --> 33:52.999
What then? Let him watch
us run around like idiots?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.131
Play yesterday's footage.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.119
Aw. Shark Week had
his first thought.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.329
Shut it, Boomer. Say it again.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.639
Play yesterday's footage
at the same time.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.199
I can do that.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.159
And we can operate
without eyes on us.

34:08.159 --> 34:12.281
- You mean Batman's or Waller's?
- Both.

34:14.480 --> 34:18.639
The intensive treatment building
is there, just across the yard.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.918
Let's move.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.607
Low profile.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.290
Frost. Move your ass.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.478
Top priority are those towers.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.998
I can scale them.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.686
No time.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.279
You do two, I'll do two.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.127
Fine. On my mark. Now.

35:10.880 --> 35:13.328
- You missed.
- Wait for it.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.841
Patrol, I need a sweep
of the yard. Ugh!

35:22.280 --> 35:25.599
Boom! In your face.

35:25.600 --> 35:29.679
He got to his walkie. I'd score
that a miss. You two-bit C-lister.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.844
That's it!

35:35.840 --> 35:37.479
U.S.A!

35:37.480 --> 35:39.370
U.S.A!

35:39.480 --> 35:42.531
Boys, we got company.

35:44.760 --> 35:48.642
- Shark, no.
- Finally, some action.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.399
So much for low profile.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.299
Status report. I've got
you in the exercise yard,

36:07.325 --> 36:09.567
but you don't show
up on the cameras.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.999
Must be something wrong
with the system.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.079
Damn it. We're a
little busy right now.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.999
I'll call you back.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.529
Don't yank me around, convict.
Get the cane. Get out.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.247
Yahtzee.

36:40.680 --> 36:43.159
Victor Zsasz, we got
you surrounded.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.879
Please. Please don't hurt me.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.359
Let the girl go
before it gets ugly.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.719
The Zombie's mine to liberate.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.929
I have righteous work to do.

36:58.920 --> 37:02.449
I'm not in the mood tonight, Zsasz.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.159
<i>You seem troubled tonight, sir.</i>

37:18.160 --> 37:20.159
It's Harley, Alfred.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.679
She was acting odd.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.519
<i>Odder than usual, you mean?</i>

37:24.520 --> 37:27.359
Like she was happy to get caught.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.599
<i>Maybe she missed her, uh, pudding.</i>

37:30.600 --> 37:31.839
Maybe.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.919
More likely it's linked
to the Joker's bomb.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.005
Arkham had a yellow
alert this evening.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.046
<i>Everything looks to be in place.</i>

37:41.680 --> 37:43.479
Hmm.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.559
That's Moshell. He
doesn't work Fridays.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.238
Neither does Ferrick.
That's the Thursday crew.

37:49.239 --> 37:52.159
This isn't live. They're
broadcasting old footage.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.528
Somethings wrong at Arkham.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.922
No, no.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.519
Enough, Shark! Put him down!

38:10.880 --> 38:13.203
Ouch!

38:13.480 --> 38:16.279
Do I have your attention now?

38:16.280 --> 38:20.287
Don't break cover in the middle
of an operation unless I say so.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.719
Don't ever do that to me.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.805
Or what? You'll chew my head off?

38:29.520 --> 38:32.399
Do it. I'm begging you.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.725
You think any of you have a shot
of getting out alive without me?

38:39.720 --> 38:42.359
That's what I thought.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.439
We're just lucky
this was contained.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.879
Start following orders, all of you.

38:46.880 --> 38:50.999
Why don't you just
calm down, pudding?

38:51.000 --> 38:55.166
Don't call me pudding!

39:03.960 --> 39:05.279
Property room's here.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.767
- Locked.
- Not for long.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.444
Now that's just pathetic.

39:20.080 --> 39:24.439
The warden uses his birthday backwards
for practically all of his passwords.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.919
- How do you know that?
- I used to work here.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.919
Didn't I mention that?

39:30.920 --> 39:32.599
Come on. As what?

39:32.600 --> 39:35.319
As a psychiatrist, silly.

39:35.320 --> 39:40.282
And pal, anyone who throws boomerangs
has some real issues letting go.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.368
<i>Et voilà.</i>

39:52.880 --> 39:55.442
Where do we even begin?

39:56.040 --> 39:58.966
Everyone take a section.
Just start looking.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.045
Bloody hell.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.159
My acid playing cards.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.919
I knew I left them here.

40:17.920 --> 40:23.611
Here's that Batman costume
Mr. J used for the train heist.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.399
Aw.

40:26.400 --> 40:29.804
I've been looking
all over for this.

40:29.920 --> 40:32.402
Here's where it went.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.765
Bingo.

40:45.440 --> 40:46.839
Firefly.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.079
Killer Moth.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.599
Maxie Zeus.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.399
Never heard of any of these tools.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.279
Mr. Freeze's gun.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.011
Score.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.405
Ugh.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.759
Thanks.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.487
It's Batman.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.090
Huh?

43:47.840 --> 43:50.049
No way.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.119
The spoils of war.

43:56.120 --> 44:00.559
Black Spider just
kicked The Bat's ass?

44:00.560 --> 44:03.439
Mate, I'm a little choked up.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.842
Got the thumb drive.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.847
What?

44:09.640 --> 44:12.168
What the hell?

44:12.680 --> 44:15.162
We've been played.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.399
Where's Frosty?

44:18.400 --> 44:21.079
Frost? Damn it.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.130
Frost!

44:27.000 --> 44:28.239
Easy.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.649
I knew Waller would send someone.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.399
I'm too clever for
her to let me live.

44:38.400 --> 44:41.690
Nothing gets past you, genius.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.250
I'll make this fast.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.919
Do you even know why
you're assassinating me?

44:50.920 --> 44:55.039
The Wall says you screwed her and
to make an example out of you.

44:55.040 --> 44:58.649
And that satiated your curiosity?

44:59.240 --> 45:00.879
I don't ask questions.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.439
I don't believe that.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.119
The human mind always
has questions.

45:06.320 --> 45:11.719
My only question is why Waller didn't just
blow your head off with your nano bomb.

45:11.720 --> 45:16.159
It's the same reason
she needs me dead.

45:16.160 --> 45:20.884
Because I know how to diffuse them.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.719
Wait, what?

45:23.720 --> 45:25.759
How do you know she's
with the Riddler?

45:25.760 --> 45:28.128
She was eyeballing him
at the monitor room.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.639
So she's got herself a new guy.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.959
After everything I've done for her.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.959
Ooh, we'll see about that.

45:36.960 --> 45:39.319
I'll make five more just like her.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.959
I'll take her skin and
put someone else in it.

45:42.960 --> 45:47.119
Oh, that perfect creamy skin.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.999
Pull yourself together, man!

45:49.000 --> 45:51.119
She mocked you right to your face!

45:51.120 --> 45:54.046
Even dared to call you...

45:56.080 --> 45:57.839
pudding.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.279
Oh, that darling girl!

46:00.280 --> 46:02.125
She might even deserve me.

46:10.040 --> 46:13.719
Okay, babies, let's cook.

46:16.560 --> 46:21.363
Winner, winner, chicken
dinner. Ha-ha-ha.

46:22.200 --> 46:26.319
Oh, Harley, I take back half the
horrible things I've done to you.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.679
They're gone!

46:36.680 --> 46:39.199
Yeah, we can see that,
Harley, but where?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.519
It's Waller.

46:42.480 --> 46:44.919
<i>- I'm here.</i>
- What are you trying to pull, Deadshot?

46:44.920 --> 46:48.199
- You're not checking in.
- We had a bout with The Bat.

46:48.200 --> 46:50.799
But we're past it.
I got your cane, Waller.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.519
We're just looking for an exit.

46:52.520 --> 46:54.279
So you're all together?

46:54.280 --> 46:56.759
Of course. Why wouldn't we be?

46:56.760 --> 47:00.719
Then why has the Special Crimes unit been
called in to protect the medical center?

47:00.720 --> 47:03.999
<i>Maybe Two-Face got a</i>
<i>pair of hemorrhoids.</i>

47:04.000 --> 47:05.399
We're out of here.

47:05.400 --> 47:08.679
Please don't explode. Please don't
explode. Please don't explode.

47:08.680 --> 47:12.199
Shut up. Where's
that medical center?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.443
We're still on yellow alert.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.766
You hear something?

47:20.960 --> 47:23.089
Let me check.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.159
Hey, remember that time
when Mad Hatter...

47:27.920 --> 47:29.519
Smitty?

47:29.520 --> 47:31.919
- Smitty?
- Boo.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.890
Aah!

47:34.200 --> 47:35.519
Smitty!

47:35.520 --> 47:38.321
Put your hands in the air!

47:40.080 --> 47:42.847
- Aah!
- And boom.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.919
I'm just going to slip into
something more comfortable.

47:53.920 --> 47:57.324
So no peeking.

48:16.280 --> 48:18.559
This is the Special Crimes unit.

48:18.560 --> 48:21.042
Surrender and return to your cells.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.169
Light them up!

48:30.560 --> 48:32.839
That worked well.

48:32.840 --> 48:37.159
Then like the hanged man, we
are at the end of our rope.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.211
Wow, I hate you. Unh!

48:48.680 --> 48:51.082
You can thank us later, losers.

48:56.360 --> 48:59.279
- You all right?
- Somewhat.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.919
Glad you made it.

49:00.920 --> 49:03.119
This better be good.

49:03.120 --> 49:06.279
He knows how to turn off the bombs.

49:06.280 --> 49:08.359
Look familiar?

49:10.040 --> 49:13.119
I can do it, but you've got to
get me into the medical center.

49:13.120 --> 49:16.967
We got maybe five minutes before
Waller figures out what's what.

49:21.440 --> 49:23.559
We get to that room or we're dead.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.199
Should've brought a tank.

49:25.200 --> 49:26.840
We have one.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.959
No heights.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.759
- You're joking.
- I said, no heights!

49:40.760 --> 49:43.970
I'll guide you. Trust me.

49:53.080 --> 49:56.006
I'm crazy, but that's just nuts!

50:01.520 --> 50:03.001
Step on it.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.121
Go to the right.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.564
Let's move.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.689
Did we win?

51:02.160 --> 51:05.564
Let's see now. We'll need
this on. This for back-up.

51:06.280 --> 51:08.409
Grab a chair.

51:12.920 --> 51:15.319
Whee!

51:15.320 --> 51:17.961
How do you diffuse
this bomb, exactly?

51:19.080 --> 51:21.719
It's the electroshock.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.639
It's the what now?

51:23.640 --> 51:27.408
I'm gonna run 1000 volts through
your heads and fry your bombs.

51:27.800 --> 51:30.123
Oh.

51:30.320 --> 51:34.599
Good. Put the chairs in a
circle here around Old Sparky.

51:34.600 --> 51:40.599
Oh, I love electroshock! It's a
shiatsu massage for your brain.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.490
Lose those.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.889
I'll keep a lookout.

51:51.480 --> 51:55.771
More cops. Choppers too.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.319
This'll work?

52:00.320 --> 52:03.371
Or give you a grand mal seizure.

52:09.560 --> 52:13.719
I'm clamping you to the chairs
because you're going to wiggle.

52:13.720 --> 52:17.039
I don't trust this fruit loop.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.919
Hmm. A thousand
volts, five bodies...

52:18.920 --> 52:22.799
multiply by five, allowing for
absorption, three-second pulses...

52:22.800 --> 52:25.009
You know what you're doing, right?

52:28.460 --> 52:31.959
Damn it. Don't stop
working. Yeah, Waller?

52:31.960 --> 52:34.639
I am getting reports there's
a break-in at Arkham.

52:34.640 --> 52:37.119
- You're on red alert.
<i>- News to me.</i>

52:37.120 --> 52:40.759
What part of "off the books"
do you not understand?

52:40.760 --> 52:43.359
<i>Are you in the medical center?</i>

52:43.360 --> 52:45.171
We hit a snag.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.089
Batman again?

52:49.680 --> 52:52.447
Spider needed medical attention.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.999
Spider? But he's...

52:56.000 --> 52:59.165
No excuses, Lawton! You get that?

52:59.240 --> 53:01.563
Mm... Uh-huh.

53:01.600 --> 53:06.199
No more crap! No more time!
No more shenanigans!

53:06.200 --> 53:07.519
Uh-huh.

53:25.120 --> 53:28.039
Those scumbags are
trying to screw me.

54:00.920 --> 54:04.085
I never need to do that again.

54:04.800 --> 54:08.359
Are you kidding? I feel great!

54:08.360 --> 54:11.239
Nobody screws the Wall!

54:13.800 --> 54:17.839
- Uh, guys?
- Do it again.

54:17.840 --> 54:20.925
I don't know. Maybe his
skin is too thick?

54:39.840 --> 54:42.561
Best gun ever.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.719
Why'd his head explode?

54:46.720 --> 54:51.039
Because the bomb in his neck
didn't diffuse, you asshole.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.965
So what's his excuse?

54:57.840 --> 54:59.810
Oh, that's rich.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.205
Huh?

55:07.040 --> 55:11.959
Denzel! What have they done to you?

55:15.640 --> 55:18.839
Haven't you solved it yet?

55:18.840 --> 55:23.325
The Black Spider is Batman.

55:37.720 --> 55:39.599
I know that sound.

55:39.600 --> 55:42.970
Someone's flossing their brain.

55:50.760 --> 55:54.519
- Unh.
- Talk! Why are you here?

55:54.520 --> 55:57.685
Amanda Waller wanted
the Riddler dead.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.919
Waller? What's she got...?

56:05.360 --> 56:07.679
I'm here, bitches!

56:07.680 --> 56:10.845
And I brought favors for everybody!

56:23.440 --> 56:24.921
Whoop!

57:00.080 --> 57:02.403
Yahtzee!

57:12.040 --> 57:14.599
I think this was yours, Deadhead.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.445
Finders, keepers.

57:20.280 --> 57:22.719
Pudding! You're free.

57:25.800 --> 57:28.119
Don't you pudding me.

57:28.120 --> 57:33.359
I go away and suddenly you've got
new friends. Even picked a new guy.

57:33.360 --> 57:35.479
You got it all wrong, baby.

57:35.480 --> 57:38.239
I was using them to
help you escape.

57:38.240 --> 57:41.759
Who else would I break
into Arkham for?

57:41.760 --> 57:44.561
Nobody, that's who.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.999
It'll be just like old times.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.129
Oh.

57:59.360 --> 58:01.410
Hmm.

58:02.720 --> 58:08.763
You. New guy. I don't like
people touching my stuff.

58:14.800 --> 58:20.279
- Go ahead. You're out of bullets.
- I am not.

58:20.280 --> 58:23.799
You are. You're gonna pull the
trigger, and when nothing happens...

58:23.800 --> 58:27.679
I'm gonna punch you in the
throat and bash your brains out.

58:27.680 --> 58:29.844
Three.

58:31.760 --> 58:33.810
Two.

58:36.200 --> 58:38.079
- One.
- Hold on.

58:38.080 --> 58:41.962
Stop counting for a second.
I know there are bullets.

58:43.560 --> 58:44.919
See?

58:54.520 --> 58:59.289
Mate, you just
out-crazied the Joker.

59:04.440 --> 59:07.439
This place is crawling with cops.

59:07.440 --> 59:11.287
- I'm gonna kill Waller.
- Can we get out of here first?

59:23.280 --> 59:24.727
Mallet.

59:27.080 --> 59:28.599
It's right here, Mr. J.

59:28.600 --> 59:30.399
I was keeping it safe
for you the whole...

59:39.280 --> 59:43.321
It's time for a very big bang.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.639
Why the hell are we running?

59:52.640 --> 59:54.119
We're sitting ducks here.

59:54.120 --> 59:57.279
And whose fault is that,
do you suppose, leader?

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.279
I've been carrying this team
all night, you douche bag.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.679
- Uh, fellas?
- Really?

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.079
- Is that what you'd call it, eh?
- Guys.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.359
- Guys, listen.
- That's what I'd call it...

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.519
- you one-gimmick hack.
- Great, let's split up.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.129
- I'm better off on my own.
- Guys. Batman's here.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.159
Joker. Where did he go?

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.767
Don't owe you squat, Bats.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.199
Lawton? We can settle
our business later.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.648
Now, where's the Joker?

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.402
He and Harley took their
mallet and disappeared.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.919
That's where he's hidden the bomb.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.559
<i>Sibilance, testing. Sibilance.</i>

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.399
<i>I know you can see me, Bats.</i>

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.159
<i>Hope you brought protection because</i>
<i>I'm about to give Gotham...</i>

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.599
<i>a terminal case of tainted love...</i>

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.439
<i>and it's really gonna burn.</i>

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.199
<i>And just in case you were</i>
<i>thinking of stopping me...</i>

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.719
<i>I figured I'd invite some</i>
<i>friends to my big blow-out.</i>

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.599
Stop.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.126
Please?

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.439
I need to find Joker
and stop that bomb.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.642
Good luck with that, mate.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.279
Gotta get out of here.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.241
Yeah, but what'll get us far
enough to escape that blast?

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.448
Well, isn't that convenient?

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.361
Out of my way, loser.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.969
Mm.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.919
Mm.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.240
Oh, no, you don't, Lawton.
That's my ride.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.366
Aah!

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.083
Only one of us is getting out
of here and it ain't you.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.563
I'll get you for this, Lawton!

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.159
Get those gates closed.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.726
Where's our backup?

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.128
Now that's what I call backup.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.246
We've got it under control,
Batman. You can take...

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.239
And I'm talking to myself.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.971
Again.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.408
Going my way, handsome?

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.681
Cute kid.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.284
Hope she doesn't take
being an orphan too hard.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.041
Holy crap!

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.162
You know she's gonna
kill us, right?

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.883
Where's the fricking gas pedal?

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.199
Uh-oh. Ha!

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:21.638
Sure. He smacks me
around sometimes...

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.919
but you're the one who's
always hurting me.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.287
Now I'm gonna hurt you.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.962
Stop me if you've heard this one.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.169
Listen to me.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.319
Harley, the bomb.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.639
For someone who's not Batman...

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:04.443
you've been a real pain
in my ass. Ha-ha-ha.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.000
Deuces, new guy.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.201
- Have a seat, pudding.
- Aah!

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.767
Bang!

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.410
Waller.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.399
You knew when you sent your little suicide
squad into Arkham, they'd go off script.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.679
Oh, it's just you.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:33.926
When your bombs didn't ice them,
you figured the S.C.U. would.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.279
All that, just so you
could kill the Riddler.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.799
Let's just say I break a lot
of eggs to make an omelet.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.199
And because you're a messy cook,
the Riddler was able to escape.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.519
I got careless.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.879
- My men will get Nigma next time.
- There is no next time.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.839
No? We're the U.S. government.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.199
Who's going to blow the whistle on us?
The convicts? Who'd believe them?

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.839
You? Heh.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:07.839
You going to start a blog and
expose us? I don't think so.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.449
That's checkmate, Batman.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.319
I'm warning you.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.479
Enough.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.279
Don't they need you back
in your squalid little city?

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.242
They never did find the
Joker's body, did they?

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.770
Punk.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.124
Motherfu...

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.169
Bang.

01:12:53.305 --> 01:12:59.575
