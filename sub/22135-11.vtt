WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.237
Family is the ultimate power
on The Gifted.

00:03.271 --> 00:05.573
A lot of people
have been fighting this fight
for a long time,

00:05.606 --> 00:07.141
and now it's our turn.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Catch all-new episodes Mondays.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.711
And check out our other
Fox programs-- The Orville,

00:10.744 --> 00:12.546
Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.715
Gotham needs more people
who are willing
to fight for her.

00:14.748 --> 00:15.716
Only on Fox.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.321
There is a Sentinel robot
and armed teams in the building!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.889
-It's over. -No!
-Cait, no!

00:21.922 --> 00:23.424
CAITLIN: Those are
our children, Reed!

00:24.792 --> 00:26.927
CAMPBELL (over speaker):
Welcome to the testing room.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.762
We're not doing anything
for you.

00:28.796 --> 00:32.166
Doesn't have to be difficult.
Just show me what you can do.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.235
-Don't do what he...
-(gunshot)

00:34.268 --> 00:36.137
CAMPBELL (over speaker): Lauren,
Andrew, face the sensors.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.575
CAMPBELL: We've done it.
We now have a weapon

00:41.609 --> 00:43.411
that provides a solution
to our mutant problem.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.612
A permanent one.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.746
PAULA:
Jace, baby?

00:45.779 --> 00:48.082
Agent Turner, we need to talk.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.418
The program our children are in,
they pump the mutants

00:50.451 --> 00:51.685
full of drugs.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.421
They're given
mental conditioning,

00:53.454 --> 00:55.956
so they have to do
what they're told,

00:55.989 --> 00:58.526
and then they are sent to kill
everyone they love.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.929
Baby, what are you doing
in our little girl's name?

01:01.962 --> 01:04.465
Sentinel Services is at Trask
with a large transport vehicle.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.933
The Struckers did it.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.102
ECLIPSE: They brought more guys
than I thought.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.770
ESME: Oh, I think
it'll be all right.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.305
(Eclipse grunts)

01:11.339 --> 01:12.606
I've got my own plan.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.875
It's time to turn off
the collars.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.777
(echoing): ...time to
turn off the collars.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.446
(gunshots)

01:18.479 --> 01:19.980
-No!
-Man, what are you doing?!

01:20.013 --> 01:21.515
-Call it in right now.
-(gunshots)

01:22.650 --> 01:24.385
-No, no!
-(gunshot)

01:24.418 --> 01:25.453
-They're killing everyone.
-Who is "they"?

01:25.486 --> 01:27.054
FROST SISTERS:
Time to go, boys and girls.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.190
The fun's just starting.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.493
*

01:34.162 --> 01:36.130
So, basically,
I'm gonna buy a horse.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.132
(laughs) I think you'd look
great on a horse.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.968
-You think so?
-Yeah. (laughs)

01:41.001 --> 01:43.971
So, admit it, coming into town
wasn't all that bad.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.907
-It wasn't so bad
coming into town. -Mm.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.310
But next time,
I'm gonna pick the movie.

01:49.343 --> 01:53.147
Okay, one with less brooding and
whining about one's feelings.

01:53.181 --> 01:56.317
(laughs) I do have Die Hard
on Blu-ray back at my place.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.685
-Oh.
-You could come over.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.853
I have to work tomorrow morning.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.989
Those dishes aren't gonna
bus themselves.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.592
So bring a toothbrush
and some clothes.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.494
And turn it into
a regular thing?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.496
-No. I know exactly
what you're doing. -What?

02:08.529 --> 02:10.664
You're trying to make me pay
half your ridiculous rent.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.566
-That's not true.
-I'm not gonna fall for it.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.172
NATE:
Oh, my God.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.840
Are those...?

02:19.873 --> 02:22.042
Purifiers.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.011
We should go.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.847
Hey, what the hell
are you doing to my car?!

02:26.880 --> 02:28.216
(quietly):
Stop it.

02:28.249 --> 02:32.520
One of us saw you walk into
the movies a couple hours ago.

02:32.553 --> 02:35.356
You got no business being out
among innocent humans.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.557
Screw you!

02:36.590 --> 02:38.259
-Let's go, now.
-Are you one, too?

02:39.727 --> 02:41.729
Speak up, boy!

02:43.731 --> 02:46.734
No. No, I'm-I'm human.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.741
You're not gonna do anything?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.244
How can you be okay with this?

02:56.277 --> 02:59.580
How can any of you
be okay with this?!

02:59.613 --> 03:03.116
(quietly): Just go, okay?
Please. Run.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.919
No.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.225
PURIFIER:
Your kind isn't welcome here.

03:11.259 --> 03:14.428
Hey, girl, better run!

03:19.300 --> 03:21.302
*

03:26.874 --> 03:29.743
WILLIAM: Why don't you tell me
exactly what happened.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.179
SOPHIE:
The alarms were going off.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.781
-People were coming.
-We went one way.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.749
The Mutant Underground
went the other.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.919
They took the Struckers
without so much as a thank you.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.921
WILLIAM:
And in the two days since then,

03:40.954 --> 03:42.623
you've had no contact
of any kind?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.692
They felt a little used.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.460
We wanted to give them
some space.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.263
Our parting moments were...
heated.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.131
WILLIAM:
To say the least.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.439
This business
at the Trask lab... messy.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.808
Didn't see you put your ass
on the line.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.778
We barely got out of there
with our lives.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.281
Think about that the next time
you pat yourself on the back

04:07.315 --> 04:09.617
for taking down a hedge fund
from behind your desk.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.720
I was recruited to rebuild
the Hellfire Club with you.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.955
Activities like mine
make that possible,

04:14.988 --> 04:18.058
while indiscretions
like yours make that...

04:18.091 --> 04:20.294
difficult.

04:20.328 --> 04:23.497
You killed a dozen
Sentinel Services agents.

04:23.531 --> 04:25.466
Mm. It was unfortunate.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.468
It would've been more,
but we didn't have time.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.803
-To finish off the rest.
-A lot of noise,

04:29.837 --> 04:31.305
and the Hound program
is still running,

04:31.339 --> 04:33.307
stronger than ever,
from what our sources say.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.143
(chuckles) You don't need
to tell us there's a problem.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.244
We were there.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.646
-Most of us, anyway.
-Ugh.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.648
WILLIAM: Our associates
have made it clear to me

04:40.681 --> 04:42.983
that we need to act quickly,
but they're concerned

04:43.016 --> 04:46.186
we don't have the firepower to
take this program on-- not now.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.589
We can get help from
the same place we got it before.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.023
The Mutant Underground?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.693
Some of them will be grateful
we saved mutant lives.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.194
And as for the rest...

04:54.227 --> 04:57.230
we can be very convincing.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.672
A little something for expenses.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.375
Don't let us down.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.678
JACE:
Edward Weeks was a good man.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.347
He was a good agent...

05:13.381 --> 05:15.849
and he was my friend.

05:15.883 --> 05:19.620
He lived a life of service, and
he gave the ultimate sacrifice.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.188
POLARIS:
Everything Dreamer did,

05:21.221 --> 05:25.359
she did for everyone here,
up until the very end.

05:25.393 --> 05:29.897
She could've disguised herself
as a human forever,

05:29.930 --> 05:32.032
but she chose...

05:32.065 --> 05:35.202
to live here with us,
her true family.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.705
JACE: I grew up
in my granddad's church.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.039
There's a story
that I learned there

05:39.072 --> 05:41.709
that I think is relevant today.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.243
In the beginning,

05:43.276 --> 05:45.913
the Lord loved one angel
above all the others.

05:45.946 --> 05:50.317
To him, he gave special gifts.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.486
He made that angel beautiful

05:52.520 --> 05:54.087
and powerful.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.390
But one day, that angel
decided that he wanted

05:56.424 --> 05:57.391
to rule over Heaven.

05:57.425 --> 06:01.061
That angel disobeyed God.

06:01.094 --> 06:05.933
And for that, he was cast down
out of Heaven.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.902
That angel was Lucifer.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.238
We have, living among us,

06:11.271 --> 06:14.508
some who have been given
special gifts.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.611
Some who, like Lucifer,

06:17.645 --> 06:19.513
have followed their pride
into darkness.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.682
They ask for understanding.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.418
They ask for tolerance, but...

06:24.452 --> 06:29.122
I am done tolerating evil.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.025
ECLIPSE: It's days like today
that remind us we're up against

06:32.059 --> 06:33.961
people that don't
think of us as human.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.764
And they will point
to our differences.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.132
But the simple fact is this:

06:39.166 --> 06:41.735
We love like they do.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.641
We die like they do.

06:47.675 --> 06:49.443
We grieve like they do.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.945
We share that today.

06:51.979 --> 06:55.115
Sonya will not be forgotten.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.317
And I promise...

06:59.319 --> 07:01.288
...we will find justice for her.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.957
I promise you, we're gonna find
the mutants responsible for this

07:03.991 --> 07:05.258
and bring them to justice.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.064
And we will never,

07:11.098 --> 07:14.902
ever forget our friend.

07:14.935 --> 07:19.272
* Well, I've lost it all,
I'm just a silhouette *

07:21.274 --> 07:26.680
* I'm a lifeless face
that you'll soon forget *

07:26.714 --> 07:29.650
* My eyes are damp

07:29.683 --> 07:33.186
* From the words you left

07:33.220 --> 07:36.657
* Ringing in my head

07:36.690 --> 07:39.693
* When you broke my chest

07:39.727 --> 07:42.262
* Ringing in my head

07:42.295 --> 07:46.166
* When you broke my chest

07:46.199 --> 07:50.103
* And if you're in love

07:50.137 --> 07:54.007
* Then you are the lucky one

07:54.041 --> 07:57.177
* 'Cause most of us are bitter

07:57.210 --> 08:00.380
* Over someone

08:00.413 --> 08:04.017
* Setting fire to our insides

08:04.051 --> 08:06.854
* For fun

08:06.887 --> 08:11.224
* To distract our hearts
from ever missing them *

08:11.258 --> 08:14.862
* But I'm forever missing him.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.897
*

08:24.838 --> 08:26.840
*

08:46.426 --> 08:47.928
(sniffles)

08:53.533 --> 08:55.035
(sniffles)

09:03.443 --> 09:05.946
-Are you...?
-I'm-I'm all right.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.885
I know she meant a lot to you.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.624
She really loved you.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.462
If there's anything you need,
I, uh...

09:22.495 --> 09:25.966
Just say the word.
I want to help.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.806
(sighs)

09:34.642 --> 09:37.544
Things are so...
confused in there.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.546
This whole business
with Esme and her sisters,

09:39.579 --> 09:40.981
nobody can agree whether

09:41.014 --> 09:42.983
what they did was a disaster
or a miracle.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.491
So what do we do?

09:51.524 --> 09:54.294
Stay focused. We take down
the Hound program.

09:54.327 --> 09:57.497
-Do we have a game plan?
-Not yet.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.000
All I know is
I can't lose any more friends.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.313
-You want to talk about it?
-No.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.315
No, I-I really don't.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.651
Talking about it
only makes me feel worse.

10:17.685 --> 10:21.689
We understand this place is
full of difficult memories now.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.091
That's one of the reasons
that we've been thinking

10:24.124 --> 10:26.326
that maybe...
we should move on.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.495
-What?
-Move on?

10:28.528 --> 10:30.530
-You mean give up?
-CAITLIN: No one's giving up.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.033
We're gonna be part of this
fight no matter where we go.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.703
It's just, with everything
we've been through...

10:35.736 --> 10:37.838
The worst of it is already over.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.206
All right,
that-that psycho doctor's

10:39.239 --> 10:41.008
already done with
all his tests and...

10:41.041 --> 10:43.210
Guys, we almost lost you
a few days ago.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.112
CAITLIN:
There is so much tension between

10:45.145 --> 10:46.646
everyone right now.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.684
We can't get caught
in the middle.

10:50.718 --> 10:54.554
And maybe that means that we go
to Mexico, like we talked about.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.356
LAUREN:
So that's it?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.191
You've made up your mind, right?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.893
We're just gonna run away?

10:59.927 --> 11:01.895
Going to Mexico
isn't running away.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.631
There are refugees
that need help there, too.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.033
Maybe more than here.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.534
But here is where we can
make a difference.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.869
LAUREN:
He's right.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.437
I want to do something.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.473
REED: Right now,
I think we're gonna

11:13.506 --> 11:15.608
have to agree to disagree
on this.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.047
SHATTER:
Everybody! Everybody, listen up!

11:20.080 --> 11:22.415
We got incoming.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.087
Marcos, they're coming.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.522
-They got past
the perimeter guards. -Who did?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.332
What are they doing here?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.101
What the hell do you want?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.070
-Calm down.
-There's no need to get excited.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.905
We're just here to talk.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.273
Talk about what?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.308
We need your help.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.921
We'll get right to the point.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.256
We're here
about the Hound program.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.524
It's still going on.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.126
It's looking to expand, in fact.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.295
-We want your help to stop it.
-ECLIPSE: What?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.130
No, you came in here
and lied to us.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.432
(scoffs)
What, now you want our help?

12:12.465 --> 12:13.801
You used us so you could

12:13.834 --> 12:15.202
slaughter those agents
at the lab.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.772
We did what we had to do.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.440
I saved your children.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.775
Did I mislead you?

12:21.809 --> 12:24.444
Yes, so you would
do what had to be done.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.213
And as for your plan

12:26.246 --> 12:29.382
to ask the Sentinel Services
to give up nicely,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.651
that would have ended
with as many corpses.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.987
-But they would've been yours.
-Why do you need us?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.956
BLINK:
Yeah, I saw you three

12:35.989 --> 12:38.391
controlling people's minds.
You can handle this on your own.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.559
They know what we look like.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.294
And we can't take on
Sentinel Services

12:41.328 --> 12:42.562
by ourselves.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.298
But we have to act now.

12:45.332 --> 12:50.137
Make no mistake, the humans
will come for us all.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.139
We have information
about Campbell's plans,

12:52.172 --> 12:53.740
resources to share.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.176
-Meanwhile, you have...
-Muscle.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.345
(murmuring)

12:58.378 --> 12:59.579
CAITLIN:
Hang on.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.849
Are we seriously
considering this?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.151
No, we're not. We're not gonna
listen to this anymore.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.687
Enough. We're not debating this,
not here, not now.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.623
We heard what you had to say.
Now you need to leave.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.660
-Think it over.
-Don't take too long.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.195
We'll be back.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.310
(church bell tolling)

13:47.227 --> 13:50.964
That was a moving speech
you gave for Agent Weeks.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.966
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.035
What do you want?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.904
I admire what you did
at the lab.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.372
Taking those mutants
out of my cells,

13:59.406 --> 14:02.542
trying to spare them the trials
of the Hound program.

14:02.575 --> 14:05.412
It was good of you, decent.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.716
Yes, I'm not a monster,
Agent Turner.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.218
(chuckles)

14:11.251 --> 14:13.253
I'm aware that our program,

14:13.286 --> 14:16.223
while it is many things,
is not humane.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.558
Then why the hell
did you start it?

14:18.591 --> 14:21.895
Think of the men who dropped
the atom bombs in World War Two.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.731
They carried a great burden
to end a terrible conflict

14:24.764 --> 14:26.566
that threatened all humanity.

14:26.599 --> 14:31.838
This, unfortunately,
is a similar task.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.507
My point is I understand.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.576
You were simply trying
to be merciful.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.945
Yeah.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.280
My friend got killed because it.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.615
Well, the time
for mercy is over.

14:42.649 --> 14:46.954
The fact is
this is a crucial moment for us.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.423
What's that supposed to mean?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.926
The research at Trask has
entered an exciting new phase,

14:52.960 --> 14:54.962
but we want your support.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.466
Just hear me out on this.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.442
(sighs) There you are.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.777
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.313
Yep, well, here I am.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.782
Come on.
Supposed to be in school.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.218
You're serious?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.886
Now? I-I mean,
everybody's freaking out

15:19.919 --> 15:21.888
about those triplets,
and we have to go do algebra?

15:21.921 --> 15:24.124
I don't even know why Mom
made this stupid school

15:24.157 --> 15:26.459
if she's just gonna bail on it.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.229
Look, I've been thinking.

15:29.262 --> 15:33.233
I don't want to leave either,
but with everything going on,

15:33.266 --> 15:35.335
maybe it's best.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.704
-What are you talking about?
-(indistinct chatter)

15:41.208 --> 15:43.176
Don't pretend
like you didn't notice.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.179
Clarice didn't tell anyone
exactly what we did in that lab,

15:46.213 --> 15:49.482
but... people know
something happened.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.917
-Yeah, so what?
-Andy.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.519
All we have to do is hold hands,

15:52.552 --> 15:54.754
and we can bring down
an entire building.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.423
With Esme
and her sisters around,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.025
it's a bad time to be here.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.896
Maybe it's the best time.

16:12.872 --> 16:13.940
SAGE:
I did some digging.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.675
Couldn't find much out there,

16:15.708 --> 16:18.678
but there are three of them,
that we know of:

16:18.711 --> 16:21.448
-Esme, Sophie and Phoebe.
-Spunky.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.783
-Do they have a last name?
-Frost.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.785
But they use
new aliases every week.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.687
When Sophie and Phoebe
were arrested,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.356
they gave their last name
as "Cuckoo."

16:29.389 --> 16:31.024
Probably just
to piss off the cops.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.860
When you were in the lab,
they talk about themselves?

16:33.893 --> 16:36.396
It's not like we had a chat.
We were in a military transport.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.630
And then they got real busy

16:37.664 --> 16:39.132
turning the place
into a shooting gallery.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.202
Their police file says
they're some kind of hive mind.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.971
They're capable
of limited psychic control

16:45.004 --> 16:47.374
if they're close and the target
doesn't see it coming.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.210
They're politically connected,
wealthy. One of them...

16:50.243 --> 16:52.712
even infiltrated Senator
Montez's campaign last year.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.047
BLINK:
Montez?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.716
That jackass is
a straight-up Purifier.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.885
They've got the right enemies,
that's for damn sure.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.720
THUNDERBIRD:
Doesn't mean we can trust them.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.056
If we actually form an alliance
with these people,

17:03.090 --> 17:04.757
it's gonna tear
this place apart.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.826
This place is
already coming apart.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.895
There's no other options.
We have to fight.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.730
Those guys have been arguing
since this morning.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.065
(arguing continues)

17:12.099 --> 17:13.900
I'll deal with it.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.069
MAN: What I do know is those
triplets are on our side...

17:16.103 --> 17:18.171
Now, half these people
hate the Frosts.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.674
And the other half think they're
the only ones that can save us.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.077
How about you?

17:24.111 --> 17:26.079
Honestly?

17:26.113 --> 17:28.081
I don't know.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.251
What I do know is that I'm not
gonna run and hide anymore.

17:31.284 --> 17:34.454
I'm not going to worry
about why I feel what I feel.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.124
Doesn't really matter now,
does it?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.226
No.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.695
Not now.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.132
Hey, John.
Could you come over here?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.108
Okay, Lorna,
you can't be serious.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.111
Is that right?
'Cause I feel pretty serious.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.279
They turned us
against each other.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.613
I mean, we're nothing to them.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.048
-Okay, you're just upset
Esme tased you. -(scoffs)

18:02.081 --> 18:03.550
And I'm sorry,
but I'm not crying

18:03.583 --> 18:04.984
for the Sentinel Service agents.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.487
The point is is we're suppose
to be a team, babe.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.789
We're not chess pieces
to be moved on a board.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.624
I know I'm not.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.859
You all right?

18:14.261 --> 18:16.229
-Hey.
-Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.798
I'm just thinking.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.834
My bottom line is
that they got the job done.

18:21.868 --> 18:25.071
-Is that all that matters?
-Maybe.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.607
If it's a question of our
survival, maybe it has to be.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.512
Hey. Hey.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.248
(door opens, closes)

18:35.282 --> 18:37.684
(sighs)

18:37.717 --> 18:41.087
Hey. Hey, come on.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.489
ANDY:
I don't even know why

18:42.522 --> 18:44.691
you're asking
what I want to bring.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.959
You're just gonna make
the decision for me.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.463
What's going on?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.602
We're leaving.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.670
John said that you asked about
trying to get to Mexico,

18:57.704 --> 18:59.372
but I thought...
You're really doing this now?

18:59.406 --> 19:01.841
Yeah. We reached out
to the Fairburn station.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.211
We need you guys here.
The help you've been giving us,

19:04.244 --> 19:06.012
with the-the school
and the kids...

19:06.045 --> 19:09.682
It was a hard decision, but with
Esme and her sisters back...

19:09.716 --> 19:10.850
I don't want them here, either.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.018
That's why we have
to stick together.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.520
It's too late for that, Marcos.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.288
The last time she was here,

19:15.322 --> 19:16.389
Esme played us all
against each other.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.524
-If she does that again...
-She won't.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.459
We'll be on our guard next time.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.028
I-I wish that was enough,
but she's already turned

19:22.061 --> 19:23.896
some of the mutants here
against us.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.234
Just because we talked
to a Sentinel Service agent.

19:31.404 --> 19:35.208
Well, for what it is worth,
this mutant wants you here.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.809
REED:
I appreciate that.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.045
I do.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.080
Sorry, man.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.664
You'll want these when you get
to the Fairburn station.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.899
I'm warning you,
there's not a lot to it.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.934
-Less than here?
-Less and a lot worse.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.170
It's basically just a meeting
point for people headed south,

20:04.203 --> 20:05.405
nothing more.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.574
(trunk closes)

20:07.607 --> 20:09.276
REED:
Thank you.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.411
For everything.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.414
Yeah. Likewise.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.249
All right.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.084
Look, stay on the back roads.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.052
And stick to the speed limit.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.755
That's my superpower.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.856
(chuckles)

20:23.890 --> 20:25.892
We trained you well.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.929
Hey, where's your sister?

20:29.962 --> 20:31.531
Inside, I guess.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.766
Didn't you tell her
we were ready?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.702
Yeah. She said
she needed a minute.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.470
Maybe she didn't want to leave.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.971
(car door closes)

20:44.477 --> 20:45.778
Lauren.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.146
Hey.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.048
I hear your family's leaving.

20:49.081 --> 20:52.985
Yeah. We're going down
to Fairburn, then...

20:53.019 --> 20:54.987
I don't know, Mexico.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.623
My parents are freaked out

20:56.656 --> 20:58.458
because Esme and her sisters
came back.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.993
We're gonna have a real problem
here with or without them.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.562
Just leaving
isn't gonna solve anything.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.996
It wasn't my idea.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.798
They didn't give me
much of a choice.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.335
Listen, I get that you need
to go with your family.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.303
But take it from someone
who did lots of running.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.971
It's not gonna solve anything.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.807
At some point, you're gonna
have to take a stand.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.409
I tried that.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.745
You saw what happened.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.046
It got Sonya killed.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.318
That was not your fault. Okay?

21:25.352 --> 21:29.689
Look, I've learned the hard way
that hate feeds on fear.

21:29.722 --> 21:33.360
And if you run, hate wins.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.700
I got to go.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.876
CAMPBELL: Our test subjects
have been somewhat limited.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.011
You took most of them
with you, after all.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.446
We worked with what we have.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.047
Yeah, I've seen
Hounds before, Doctor.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.683
This isn't about
the individuals.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.185
We've learned how to combine
their abilities.

21:59.218 --> 22:02.188
Combine their abilities?
And this is legal?

22:02.221 --> 22:04.357
It's well within the mandate
of Trask Laboratories.

22:04.391 --> 22:06.025
No, no, I'm not talking
about your company memos.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.059
I'm talking about...

22:09.396 --> 22:11.364
I'm talking about dealing
with the Department of Justice.

22:11.398 --> 22:12.799
As far as they're concerned,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.534
we're already hanging
by a thread.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.569
Well, I'm confident
our political allies can handle

22:16.603 --> 22:18.705
the bureaucrats once they see
the program's potential.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.808
They know we have to take
bold steps to end this war.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.544
-And this program can do that?
-I believe it will.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.145
The mutant siblings
we've studied--

22:26.178 --> 22:27.880
the Struckers, the Frosts--
all have the ability

22:27.914 --> 22:32.051
to harness exponentially
more power together than apart.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.587
Take this one, for example.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.589
She has the ability
to manipulate

22:36.623 --> 22:39.426
intermittent bursts of inertia,
while this one...

22:41.694 --> 22:44.330
...influences gravity
in minor ways.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.734
Separately, the powers are
of limited use, but together...

22:47.767 --> 22:51.070
-that's another matter.
-Okay. If you say so.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.406
CAMPBELL: My description
won't do it justice, but...

22:53.440 --> 22:55.107
I was hoping
we could demonstrate

22:55.141 --> 22:56.743
the program in the field.

22:56.776 --> 23:00.012
Whatever our differences
in the past,

23:00.046 --> 23:02.348
I know you still want to take
down the Mutant Underground.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.917
And I want my program to expand.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.620
We can help each other here.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.963
Okay, yeah, I think I...
I think I have a couple leads

23:16.996 --> 23:19.732
-we can follow up on.
-Good.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.076
(birds chirping)

23:34.413 --> 23:37.584
I thought there were supposed
to be people here to meet us.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.556
WES: Just had to make sure
you were friendlies.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.458
Wes!

23:45.492 --> 23:47.460
Hey, is this your new job?

23:47.494 --> 23:49.328
Yeah. I've been
helping out security.

23:49.361 --> 23:53.332
I make sure no one sees who's
here unless we want them to.

23:56.368 --> 23:59.739
So, um, are you guys...?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.108
LAUREN: We're leaving.
We're heading to Mexico.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.812
We've got about 20 mutants.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.014
We're still arranging a ride.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.651
Let's get you all some dinner.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.452
It's good to see you, man.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.493
Look who's the cool dad
all of a sudden.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.530
It's just nice
to see Lauren smile again.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.574
(crickets chirping)

24:39.979 --> 24:41.981
(footsteps approaching)

24:44.216 --> 24:46.052
Can't sleep?

24:49.221 --> 24:51.190
What are you doing here?

24:51.223 --> 24:54.694
Are you... Esme?
Or which one?

24:54.727 --> 24:56.696
Oh. What's it matter?

24:56.729 --> 24:59.031
We're sort of...

24:59.065 --> 25:02.034
three in one.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.370
Heard about you and your family
running off here from Atlanta.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.873
What's that about?

25:06.906 --> 25:09.208
Uh, ask them.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.578
Guess they wanted
to protect us or something.

25:11.611 --> 25:15.247
-They really don't get it,
do they? -Get what?

25:16.849 --> 25:19.552
You're hardly someone
who needs protecting.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.220
You need to talk
to your parents.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.556
I tried.
They didn't listen.

25:23.590 --> 25:26.425
You have to speak to them
as Andrew von Strucker

25:26.458 --> 25:28.928
if you want to be
taken seriously.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.399
Surprised I know your real name?

25:33.432 --> 25:36.235
Um...

25:36.268 --> 25:38.605
I know all sorts of things--

25:38.638 --> 25:41.741
about what your family was,
about what you're meant to be.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.410
I got to go.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.246
You're not a child anymore.
We need you.

25:47.279 --> 25:50.717
Maybe we need you most of all.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.832
*

26:29.989 --> 26:31.457
Sorry to wake you.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.226
Ah. I wondered why
I suddenly had the urge

26:34.260 --> 26:36.328
to get some fresh air.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.997
Where's the rest of you?

26:38.030 --> 26:41.000
Off on... other errands.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.836
You know how it is.
Divide and conquer.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.906
Look, time is running out here.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.175
We need to know
if this is gonna happen.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.143
Why would I tell you that?

26:51.177 --> 26:55.047
Because... deep down,
you like the idea of teaming up.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.418
Telepath, remember?

26:59.451 --> 27:03.189
(chuckles)
You pissed a lot of people off.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.324
People don't like being puppets.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.326
You mean you and your boyfriend?

27:07.359 --> 27:10.262
Oh, he'll get over it.
They all will.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.665
I'm not so sure about that.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.001
There's a rumor about
some terrorist group

27:15.034 --> 27:17.336
you're a part of.
The Hellfire Club?

27:17.369 --> 27:19.706
-(laughs)
-Oh, I'm sorry, something funny?

27:19.739 --> 27:23.776
You... you have no idea, do you?

27:23.810 --> 27:25.544
-About your father.
-My father is

27:25.577 --> 27:27.346
a pilot who died
in a plane crash when...

27:27.379 --> 27:29.448
No, your real father--
not the poor sap

27:29.481 --> 27:31.050
-who married your mother.
-Oh, geez.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.885
-You must have heard stories.
-I don't want to talk about...

27:32.919 --> 27:35.354
But you should know that
your father was a member

27:35.387 --> 27:36.689
of the Hellfire Club.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.358
More than a member, a king.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.227
That makes you royalty.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.862
What, because he got
my mother pregnant?

27:42.895 --> 27:44.897
That has nothing to do with me.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.202
What about your pregnancy?

27:50.236 --> 27:51.938
It's changing you.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.207
You know it is.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.476
Want to protect the child?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.311
Join us.

27:59.345 --> 28:02.381
You think I can just make them
change their minds?

28:02.414 --> 28:04.550
A lot of people
in there hate you.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.053
This isn't a popularity contest.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.888
It's a war.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.656
You have to ask yourself:

28:10.689 --> 28:13.192
What matters most?

28:17.764 --> 28:19.766
*

28:46.458 --> 28:48.127
(Lauren sighs)

28:57.736 --> 29:00.372
You, uh, don't have to help.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.775
-If you want more sleep,
I'm good here. -No.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.476
I want to.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.613
Besides, it's hard
to sleep these days.

29:07.646 --> 29:10.149
Feels better
when I'm doing something.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.885
Yeah. I heard what happened.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.486
In the lab, with Sonya.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.788
Don't do what he...

29:15.822 --> 29:17.289
-(gunshot)
-No!

29:17.323 --> 29:19.291
LAUREN:
It was horrible.

29:19.325 --> 29:22.328
I kept thinking, what if
I had done something different?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.430
-Maybe Sonya would still...
-Hey, hey, hey.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.802
You can't take back
what happened.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.504
But you can let it
make you stronger.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.475
How do I do that?

29:36.508 --> 29:39.979
I like to think...

29:40.012 --> 29:42.481
a lot of bad stuff
happened to me,

29:42.514 --> 29:46.485
but it had to happen,
because it led me here.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.321
To this.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.323
Stacking boxes?

29:51.357 --> 29:52.925
-Hell yeah.
-(laughs)

29:52.959 --> 29:55.027
If I didn't have
this job stacking boxes,

29:55.061 --> 29:57.463
I would've never been here
when you showed up.

29:59.531 --> 30:02.634
Yeah, my family is supposed
to be going to Mexico.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.006
We might not be here
much longer.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.808
Yeah. That's okay.

30:11.543 --> 30:15.681
'Cause even if it was
just a day, five minutes...

30:15.714 --> 30:17.850
I would've wanted to be here.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.052
I couldn't not see you again.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.400
(birds chirping)

30:44.576 --> 30:46.812
-(echoing boom)
-(murmuring)

30:46.845 --> 30:50.082
Whoa. What was that about?

30:50.116 --> 30:52.885
I was just thinking.

30:52.919 --> 30:56.088
Well, those were some...
some strong thoughts.

30:56.122 --> 30:57.389
Yeah.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.158
That much metal,

30:59.191 --> 31:02.428
this distance, not even trying--
I could never do that before.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.063
No.

31:04.096 --> 31:07.399
-I think it's 'cause of
the baby. -Yeah?

31:07.433 --> 31:10.269
-Well, is it okay?
-It's fine.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.738
I feel amazing.

31:12.771 --> 31:16.008
Well, babe, the last time
you felt amazing...

31:16.042 --> 31:17.843
you know, you had one of your...

31:17.876 --> 31:20.412
Look, I know what
a bipolar episode feels like,

31:20.446 --> 31:23.015
-but this is different.
-Okay.

31:23.049 --> 31:26.052
-And you're sure?
-Never been more sure.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.121
I'm changing.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.293
Everything's changing.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.798
I know.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.134
Johnny's downstairs.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.612
THUNDERBIRD: The Frost sisters
will be here soon.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.481
We need to decide what to do.

31:55.514 --> 31:58.284
Far as I'm concerned,
the psychics are a nonstarter.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.953
-Because their tactics make you
uncomfortable? -Uncomfortable?

32:00.987 --> 32:03.155
They murdered a dozen people
without even blinking.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.157
We don't know
the first thing about them.

32:05.191 --> 32:07.393
We do know one thing about them.
They saved our asses.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.962
They saved themselves,
and pulled us right into

32:09.996 --> 32:11.463
an all-out war
with Sentinel Services.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.065
Congress could declare
martial law.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.967
So? They didn't need martial law

32:15.001 --> 32:17.069
-when they killed
my foster parents. -Exactly.

32:17.103 --> 32:20.672
Why should we fight with
one hand tied behind our backs?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.674
We need all the allies
we can get.

32:22.708 --> 32:23.976
Do you want to cling

32:24.010 --> 32:26.145
to your ideals
or do you want to survive?

32:26.178 --> 32:27.313
We can't just chuck
our principles

32:27.346 --> 32:28.914
because it's convenient.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.316
No, the X-Men
chose us for a reason,

32:30.349 --> 32:31.984
and it's not 'cause we can kill.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.153
If we wanted to kill people,
we would've done it

32:34.186 --> 32:36.422
a thousand times already,
but we didn't.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.924
We have to be better than that.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.360
Now, we need to take out
the Hound program,

32:41.393 --> 32:43.262
and we will, Lorna.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.998
But we have to do it our way.

32:46.032 --> 32:50.002
Listen up. I just got word
over the police radio.

32:50.036 --> 32:52.304
-Something big is
about to go down. -Where?

32:56.475 --> 32:59.511
Hey. I just checked in
with the transport people.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.680
-And? Any luck?
-There's a trucking company

33:01.713 --> 33:05.184
-that might be able to help us.
-"Might"?

33:05.217 --> 33:07.686
-So there's a chance
we could stay longer? -Maybe.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.021
I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.023
Yeah, but if we do
have some time off,

33:11.057 --> 33:12.291
I could go back
to Atlanta, right?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.226
The reason we came here
was to get away from Atlanta.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.861
-But I can help people there.
-CAITLIN: Okay, Andy.

33:15.894 --> 33:17.529
We've already talked about this.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.565
-I don't understand...
-No, you don't understand...

33:24.103 --> 33:25.404
REED:
Get down!

33:30.242 --> 33:32.711
-Oh, my God.
-(chuckles)

33:32.744 --> 33:34.713
-That kind of power, I've never
seen... -CAMPBELL: Exactly.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.482
This is a whole new level,
Agent Turner.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.151
We can flush the mutants out
safely without risking your men.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.520
And that's just the beginning.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.989
WES: I've got us covered.
Get out now!

33:44.022 --> 33:45.924
-ANDY: No, let's fight.
-Andy, no!

33:45.957 --> 33:47.826
Lauren, come on!

33:47.859 --> 33:50.229
Andy!

33:50.262 --> 33:51.997
Andy. Andy!

33:52.030 --> 33:53.732
Andy!

33:53.765 --> 33:56.468
CAITLIN: How are they
doing this? What's going on?

33:58.104 --> 34:00.439
Oh, my God.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.279
Reed. We're on our way,

34:07.313 --> 34:09.248
less than five minutes out.
What's going on?

34:09.281 --> 34:11.083
We're hiding out at
the south end of the building,

34:11.117 --> 34:12.418
but we can't get to an exit.

34:12.451 --> 34:15.121
-How many people are with you?
-Uh, just us and Wes.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.422
Uh, most of the refugees
have already surrendered.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.757
-Uh, Andy's hurt.
-How bad?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.293
He's unconscious,
but Cait is afraid to move him.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.629
Wes has put up a mirage
to hide us.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.197
I don't think
he can hold on forever.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.765
All right, we're almost there.
Just hold on.

34:26.798 --> 34:28.800
We'll portal in,
get you out of there.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.771
CAMPBELL:
I must say, Agent Turner,

34:32.804 --> 34:34.440
it's an excellent choice
in target.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.442
-Excellent choice, indeed.
-Well, we caught a break.

34:36.475 --> 34:37.876
Got a tip-off on a truck driver

34:37.909 --> 34:39.445
that ships mutants
south from here.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.779
(Hounds howling)

34:40.812 --> 34:42.981
We're still working
on the process,

34:43.014 --> 34:46.885
but you see the manacle
around their wrists there?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.121
That unit actually mingles
their bloodstreams,

34:49.155 --> 34:51.223
conjoining them
and their powers.

34:51.257 --> 34:54.260
With the right mutants,
possibilities are endless.

34:57.829 --> 35:01.633
(chuckles) That kind of
overwhelming force,

35:01.667 --> 35:03.469
ultimately, it's a kindness.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.571
Mutants might disagree.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.140
As long as they think
resistance works,

35:08.174 --> 35:10.509
the violence will continue.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.578
-(indistinct radio chatter)
-All units,

35:12.611 --> 35:14.346
prepare to move in,
surround the building.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.318
AGENT:
We're surrounding the building.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.819
AGENT 2:
Take the left side.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.188
AGENT 3:
Moving into position.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.190
AGENT 4: Move to the right side
of the building.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.325
Sentinel Services is setting up
around the building.

35:26.358 --> 35:29.328
-Can you get us in?
-Yeah, I think so.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.996
(explosion)

35:31.029 --> 35:32.764
What the hell was that?

35:32.798 --> 35:35.801
I'm pretty sure
we're gonna find out.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.014
(straining)

35:49.047 --> 35:51.283
REED:
Andy, wake up.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.018
-Andy, can you hear me?
-(Wes grunting)

35:53.051 --> 35:54.720
Andy, talk to us, son.

35:54.753 --> 35:58.190
-Come on.
-My head... it hurts.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.826
(shouting)

36:04.330 --> 36:06.832
-They're gonna tear
the building apart. -Yes.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.471
POLARIS:
John, where are they?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.406
THUNDERBIRD:
Go! Down the hall!

36:23.782 --> 36:25.317
(grunts)

36:25.351 --> 36:27.386
-I'm sorry.
-AGENT: Target spotted.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.588
-Open fire!
-They're coming!

36:33.592 --> 36:35.261
This way, come on!

36:40.299 --> 36:41.667
Come on!

36:41.700 --> 36:43.669
Hey, come on, we got to go.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.103
-Come on.
-We'll cover you!

37:04.122 --> 37:05.624
Lorna!

37:05.657 --> 37:07.092
I'm okay.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.427
-Lorna!
-I'm okay.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.761
THUNDERBIRD:
They're too powerful!

37:09.795 --> 37:10.962
Get us out of here now!

37:12.063 --> 37:14.032
AGENT (over radio):
Sir.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.468
-We've lost visual contact
with the mutants. -Damn.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.605
Whatever holdouts
are still in that building,

37:19.638 --> 37:21.239
I want them. Move out right now.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.611
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:25.644 --> 37:28.213
-We have to get out of here.
-Yeah.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.781
We can't take on those Hounds.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.783
We'll never make it
if they see us.

37:31.817 --> 37:32.984
(grunts)

37:39.758 --> 37:41.793
AGENT: Found a vehicle, sir.
Engine's still warm.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.629
We'll search the area.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.297
Ugh, they're all
through the woods.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.599
The car's blown.
They'll be on us soon.

37:52.838 --> 37:55.407
-Andy, what is it?
-We go that way.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.975
The woods are full of agents.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.477
-They said it was safe.
-Who said it was safe?

37:58.510 --> 38:00.746
I know how to get out of here,
okay? Just follow me.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.781
-Andy, wait!
-Andy!

38:04.850 --> 38:06.385
This way.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.492
This way.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.494
Ugh! Help!

38:15.527 --> 38:17.529
Let's go.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.267
What are you doing to them?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.336
We're just giving them
something to think about.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.171
I know you're squeamish
about killing.

38:26.204 --> 38:29.675
More agents coming this way.
Too many for us to handle.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.877
Well, then,
I guess you better get in.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.011
Come on!

38:33.044 --> 38:34.746
*

38:48.059 --> 38:50.729
Sir, I've seen this program
at full force.

38:50.762 --> 38:54.232
It's... it's more effective

38:54.265 --> 38:56.368
than anything we've ever
put in the field.

38:56.402 --> 38:58.370
-More effective than
the Sentinels? -Absolutely.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.805
I mean, the robots
are getting stronger,

38:59.838 --> 39:01.873
but in terms of raw power,
there's just,

39:01.907 --> 39:03.475
there's no comparison.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.877
CAMPBELL: Director,
this has unlimited potential.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.746
We're building on what we got
from the Strucker children,

39:07.779 --> 39:10.649
as well as their
grandfather's research.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.917
You're still talking
significant resources

39:11.950 --> 39:13.652
to get it off the ground.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.488
And not only that,
there's a reason we've kept

39:16.522 --> 39:19.157
-this kind of thing quiet.
-JACE: Sir, respectfully,

39:19.190 --> 39:20.726
we have lost too many people

39:20.759 --> 39:22.060
to be politically correct
about this.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.229
We're gonna get support
from Washington,

39:24.262 --> 39:25.731
but at the end of the day,

39:25.764 --> 39:28.299
people want results,
they want action.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.002
All right.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.738
Put together a demonstration.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.440
Benchmarks, timeline,
resources needed.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.742
We'll bring it
to Washington this week.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.077
Could we take this national?

39:39.110 --> 39:40.446
With the right support,

39:40.479 --> 39:42.681
we can make this
an international effort.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.651
With our friends around
the world, for the common good.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.287
That sounds like
a goal worth pursuing.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.538
Is he gonna be okay?

40:06.572 --> 40:09.374
He was using his powers
for a long time.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.376
His body's exhausted.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.779
Once he rehydrates,
he'll recover.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.114
BLINK:
Wes is a tough kid.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.783
So are you, by the way.

40:17.816 --> 40:19.451
Holding out like that?

40:19.485 --> 40:21.953
I don't know how you lasted
as long as you did.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.455
LAUREN:
I had to.

40:23.489 --> 40:26.124
Like you said,
hatred feeds on fear.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.959
Well, I'm glad you're here.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.261
We need all the help we can get.

40:37.335 --> 40:40.238
Hey, hey. You need to rest.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.973
Mom says you have a concussion.

40:42.007 --> 40:45.143
-I'm fine.
-No. You deserve to rest.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.379
-You saved us today, son.
-No, I didn't.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.818
They did.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.986
POLARIS: We might've not made it
out of there without you guys.

40:55.020 --> 40:57.155
-You're welcome.
-Don't mention it.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.825
We can't leave
with those Hounds out there.

40:59.858 --> 41:03.495
-You know that.
-For now, you may be right.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.296
Come on. Lie down for me.

41:12.538 --> 41:14.339
How did you even find us?

41:14.372 --> 41:16.875
We told you.
We have sources.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.844
THUNDERBIRD: So the mutants
that were attacking us,

41:18.877 --> 41:21.279
that's what you were
warning us about?

41:21.312 --> 41:23.114
That's what Campbell's
been working on at Trask?

41:23.148 --> 41:25.450
-That was just the start.
-It's going to get worse.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.286
Much worse.
That's why we need your help.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.055
POLARIS:
Okay.

41:30.088 --> 41:33.224
And you can get us to Campbell?
We can end this?

41:33.258 --> 41:36.061
We wouldn't be here
if we couldn't.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.499
-So?
-What's it going to be?

41:57.683 --> 41:59.685
(footsteps approaching)

42:08.026 --> 42:09.595
What the hell were you thinking?

42:09.628 --> 42:11.329
Hello to you, too.

42:11.362 --> 42:12.898
I've been taking calls
for hours.

42:12.931 --> 42:15.734
The Inner Circle is very unhappy
with your little stunt.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.002
Did those fossils
have a better plan?

42:17.035 --> 42:18.403
If so, they could've
shared it.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.838
Instead of hiding
behind their screens

42:19.871 --> 42:22.007
and their chess boards.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.076
You risked a lot
of important lives today.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.112
Tipping off Sentinel Services?

42:27.145 --> 42:30.448
Well, if you want to win,

42:30.481 --> 42:32.517
you have to sacrifice
a few pawns.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.753
They needed to understand
what we're up against.

42:34.786 --> 42:36.521
We're all fighting
for our survival.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.257
Nothing like a brush with death
to drive that home.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.526
We almost lost the Struckers.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.128
Oh, they're hardly lost.

42:43.161 --> 42:44.796
As you finance guys
always say...

42:44.830 --> 42:47.265
-No risk?
-No reward.

42:47.298 --> 42:49.768
Did you talk
to the Mutant Underground?

42:49.801 --> 42:51.770
Did you get the help
that we need?

42:51.803 --> 42:53.972
They're in.

43:02.648 --> 43:06.618
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:39.450 --> 43:43.321
Welcome,
fellow Homo sapiens.

43:43.354 --> 43:46.024
Welcome back. Sorry
I haven't posted in a while.

43:46.057 --> 43:50.862
I've been, you know... busy,
digging for the truth.

43:50.896 --> 43:55.466
And let me just say, what I
found is gonna blow your minds.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.536
The mutants-- they've been busy.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.338
First up, Prague.

44:00.371 --> 44:03.208
This is footage from a riot that
occurred there two days ago.

44:03.241 --> 44:04.943
For those of you
who flunked geography,

44:04.976 --> 44:06.678
Prague is in the Czech Republic.

44:06.712 --> 44:09.948
And then this, same day.
Argentina.
(all shouting)

44:09.981 --> 44:13.018
And boom-- Thailand.
Also the same day.

44:13.051 --> 44:15.353
So what's
the connection here, huh?

44:15.386 --> 44:17.622
You're not gonna get anyone
on the record about this,

44:17.655 --> 44:20.125
but my sources have told me
that this is definitely

44:20.158 --> 44:21.960
not a coincidence.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.863
A little thing
called the Hellfire Club.

44:24.896 --> 44:26.832
Secret society.
Dates way back.

44:26.865 --> 44:29.901
You'll find things--
rich people, politicians,
all a part of it.

44:29.935 --> 44:32.403
But what you will not find out
about is the inner circle,

44:32.437 --> 44:35.306
'cause that
is where the mutants are.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.575
Where are they?
Hiding in plain sight.

44:37.608 --> 44:40.311
Wall Street, high society.
That kind of stuff.

44:40.345 --> 44:43.048
People don't even know
that they're mutants,
but they're there

44:43.081 --> 44:45.516
behind the scenes,
working against us.

44:45.550 --> 44:47.685
There've been others,
back in the '60s,

44:47.719 --> 44:51.923
back when the Hellfire Club
was most powerful.

44:51.957 --> 44:54.192
And then poof-- nothing.

44:54.225 --> 44:56.161
They were gone.

44:56.194 --> 44:59.197
And now it looks like
they're back, people.

44:59.230 --> 45:00.999
And they're rebuilding.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.902
Look, just connect the dots.
Where does it start? Dallas.

45:03.935 --> 45:06.037
It links back to 7/15.

45:06.071 --> 45:09.174
We don't know how,
we don't know whose side
they're on,

45:09.207 --> 45:10.909
but what we know
is that they're out there,

45:10.942 --> 45:14.379
and we know they are working
to destroy us.

45:14.412 --> 45:17.248
It's time to wake up, people,

45:17.282 --> 45:19.450
or there won't be
any people left.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.286
Our species is on the v--
(banging on door)

45:21.319 --> 45:22.353
(crashing)

45:23.721 --> 45:25.757
You can't run from destiny
on The Gifted.

45:25.791 --> 45:28.193
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.230
People have been fighting
for a long time.

45:33.264 --> 45:34.833
And now it's our turn.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.602
Move!

45:39.604 --> 45:42.273
ANNOUNCER:
Critics agree, The Gifted...

45:44.509 --> 45:46.477
It's...

45:48.013 --> 45:49.614
These people need help.

45:50.148 --> 45:52.083
(shouting)

45:52.117 --> 45:55.821
ANNOUNCER:
The Gifted. Mondays on Fox.

45:55.854 --> 45:58.256
MAN (on phone):
We're in trouble.
We need you.
