WEBVTT

00:58.726 --> 01:00.728
I know. Trust me.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.230
I don't plan to be Nancy Drew,

01:02.230 --> 01:05.699
but I'm gonna blow this story
wide the fuck open.

01:05.699 --> 01:08.436
Her father's company literally
gets away with murder.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.037
And that is gonna change

01:10.037 --> 01:12.906
as long as you keep your balls
and go ahead with my story.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.910
Yeah.
Of course, I'm wearing the wire.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.547
Yeah. I'm at her office now.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.548
Wish me luck.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.105
It's a Carcano 91/38.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.943
This is the gun
that killed Kennedy.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.581
I thought the actual rifle
was on display

01:53.581 --> 01:55.616
at the Texas Book Depository.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.950
That would be a fake.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.321
And you have it, because...

02:03.624 --> 02:04.792
Please sit.

02:09.363 --> 02:13.167
I'm sorry if this comes off as
rude, but I'm just fascinated.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.437
Can I ask you what does
something like that even cost?

02:16.437 --> 02:17.638
It must be priceless.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.443
Well, I feel like you didn't
come here for a history lesson.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.777
So, why don't we just
skip all that,

02:23.777 --> 02:26.314
and you can hand me
that wire that you're wearing.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.350
I'm not wearing a wire.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.151
Ah, come on.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.152
Is it in your bra?

02:33.854 --> 02:35.356
Did they hide it in your skirt?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.659
Okay. This is absurd.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.128
Well, here's the thing.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.963
This is gonna go a lot smoother
if you don't treat me

02:42.963 --> 02:45.699
like I'm an idiot.
Right?

02:45.699 --> 02:47.968
This casino generates
billions of dollars.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.803
We have the top
anti-intelligence equipment

02:49.803 --> 02:51.505
in the world.

02:51.505 --> 02:56.310
Your microphone was screaming
frequencies from the second

02:56.310 --> 02:58.479
you parked your car.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.013
Can I have the wire now?

03:10.023 --> 03:12.025
It was in the bra.
It's always in the bra.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.062
Great. Why are you here?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.498
One word.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.699
Bakwas.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.871
Well, that's a myth.
Campfire stories.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.740
Well, what about
all the missing people

03:26.740 --> 03:29.176
on or near casino property?

03:29.176 --> 03:31.679
Could it have anything
to do with the undead slasher

03:31.679 --> 03:33.914
that's been stalking
these lands for years?

03:33.914 --> 03:36.350
A slasher that you now control?

03:36.350 --> 03:37.385
I'm sorry.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.220
Did you just listen to the
words that you said?

03:40.220 --> 03:44.057
Corporate slasher mind control?
It's hilarious Scooby Doo shit.

03:45.125 --> 03:48.262
Who do you work for again?
Is it National Enquirer?

03:48.262 --> 03:49.597
Daily Mail?

03:51.198 --> 03:53.033
Ms. Hart.

03:53.033 --> 03:57.037
This story is happening
with or without your consent.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.707
You can give me
your side of the story,

03:59.707 --> 04:01.241
or I can do it without you.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.913
Personally,
I'd much rather get your take.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.248
What do you say?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.388
I say, how's 2 million?

04:14.388 --> 04:15.423
2 million what?

04:16.490 --> 04:17.958
Dollars, of course.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.761
Wow.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.830
You really
are full of surprises.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.101
This...

04:29.269 --> 04:31.071
is an NDA.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.240
All you have to do is sign
on that line,

04:33.240 --> 04:35.275
and you walk out of here
with life-changing money.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.914
You can't buy
your way out of this one.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.350
I don't want your blood money.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.119
You don't?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.455
Are you sure?

04:47.455 --> 04:48.456
Positive.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.794
Okay.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.863
Well...

04:57.130 --> 04:57.931
I tried.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.047
Oh.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.352
- Hi.
<i>Yes, miss.</i>

05:18.352 --> 05:19.820
Uh, yeah.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.322
I'm gonna need a clean-up crew
and a body double.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.126

Ah.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.677
Can I help you with something?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.312
Yeah, please, and thank you.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.214
40 on one.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.717
40 on one.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.687
Uh, that'd be all?

08:44.091 --> 08:46.359
Have a safe ride back
to Rhode Island.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.034
What's your name, friend?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.506
J-- J-- J-- Jerry.

08:59.506 --> 09:03.711
Well, J-- J-- J-- Jerry,
I'm p-- p-- perplexed

09:05.412 --> 09:08.248
why you think
I'm going to Rhode Island.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.221
Oh, your-- your plates,
they say, "Rhode Island."

09:15.455 --> 09:16.423
Why would a man

09:16.423 --> 09:20.060
of such stature as yourself
give a fine fuck

09:21.061 --> 09:22.763
if I'm coming or going
to Rhode Island?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.735
Fuck off! We're closed!

09:31.739 --> 09:32.740
Now...

09:36.409 --> 09:40.614
I don't want to assume
anything here, Jerry.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.581
But, um,

09:43.116 --> 09:46.053
you must have people
coming and going

09:46.053 --> 09:47.587
all the time here.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.724
Do you ask every single one
of those people

09:50.724 --> 09:51.692
where they're going?

09:51.692 --> 09:54.227
I didn't-- I didn't--
I didn't ask where.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.562
You're right!

09:55.562 --> 09:59.599
Goddammit! You're right.
You didn't ask. You know why?

10:00.934 --> 10:03.070
'Cause you already fucking knew.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.137
N-- no.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.138
Your plates.
You've got Rhode Island--

10:05.138 --> 10:07.174
P-- p-- p-- p-- plates.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.748
Wait. What was that?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.116
What? What was what?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.086
The gun.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.453
You just-- you just looked
at my gun.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.289
No. I didn't.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.791
Oh, I fucking hate that.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.793
Hate what?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.129
You just did it again.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.598
N-- no, I...

10:31.598 --> 10:32.632
Pick it up.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.302
No.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.705
Pick it up.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.974
I'm not gonna ask you again!

10:40.974 --> 10:42.475
Pick it the fuck up!

10:43.510 --> 10:44.812
Ooh! Hey, Tex.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.118
Pull the trigger.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.487
Please just leave.
Just leave.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.491
Just l-- l-- go.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.196
Jerry.

11:03.196 --> 11:07.234
Some men,
they seek greatness

11:08.335 --> 11:11.739
while other men have greatness
thrust upon them.

11:13.841 --> 11:14.842
Do you feel that, Jerry?

11:16.343 --> 11:20.413
That's greatness thrusting
itself into your asshole.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.385
Now, pull the fucking trigger.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.693
Ooh! Oh. Jesus Christ, Jerry.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.528
- The safety's on.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.899
What, you think I'm some kind
of reckless fuck? Huh?

11:38.899 --> 11:41.568
That's a loaded firearm.
Gun safety is very important.

11:42.936 --> 11:43.871
Bye-bye now.

11:46.874 --> 11:47.741
Ooh!

11:51.411 --> 11:53.680
Sorry. I love these.

12:16.904 --> 12:20.207
You are one gorgeous bitch.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.277
You know, I love you.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.249
You ready to kick rocks, baby?

12:50.303 --> 12:51.404
Fuck you!

12:51.404 --> 12:52.572
My dad's a sheriff!

12:52.572 --> 12:54.241
He's gonna find you
and fucking kill you!

13:01.648 --> 13:02.916
You're being selfish.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.517
Ooh, you sound scared!

13:09.256 --> 13:11.291
Do me a favor.
Call up your daddy.

13:13.026 --> 13:13.827
Your face...

13:15.095 --> 13:16.596
Daddy!

13:20.133 --> 13:21.801
Daddy!

13:42.990 --> 13:44.324
It's okay. It's okay.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.548
<i>And we are gonna get
right on the scene.</i>

14:08.548 --> 14:10.984
<i>We have a breaking story
developing right now.</i>

14:10.984 --> 14:13.386
<i>We're gonna cut right
over to Jesse McPhee</i>

14:13.386 --> 14:14.687
<i>on the scene right now.</i>

14:14.687 --> 14:15.555
<i>Jesse.</i>

14:15.555 --> 14:17.157
<i>It is presently unknown</i>

14:17.157 --> 14:18.525
<i>why Johnny and Clyde</i>

14:18.525 --> 14:20.527
<i>have returned
to the ocean state.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.562
<i>Investigators can only speculate</i>

14:22.562 --> 14:24.998
<i>why after a year-long
crime spree</i>

14:24.998 --> 14:26.666
<i>of murder and rampage,</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:29.369
<i>spanning the entirety
of a nation.</i>

14:29.369 --> 14:30.703
<i>Police are baffled</i>

14:30.703 --> 14:32.872
<i>as to why the modern-day
Bonnie and Clyde</i>

14:32.872 --> 14:35.508
<i>have chosen to come back
to Rhode Island.</i>

14:35.508 --> 14:37.544
<i>We'll be actively following this
case and reporting</i>

14:37.544 --> 14:39.346
<i>all the action as it develops.</i>

14:40.380 --> 14:42.382
They're fuckin' back.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.030
Pick up, pick up.
Come on. Come on.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.600
Told your ass not to run.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.535
You bail-jumpin' motherfucker.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.576
Fuckin' bitch.

15:16.083 --> 15:16.749
Hello.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.051
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

15:18.051 --> 15:20.087
Oh, fuck, no, Lock. Uh-uh.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.722
<i>Your credits are gone.
You done used them shits up.</i>

15:22.722 --> 15:25.758
Please, pal.
You don't understand.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.893
Nah, man. You don't understand.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.728
You still owe me
from the last time.

15:28.728 --> 15:29.729
<i>You lost your badge</i>

15:29.729 --> 15:31.398
<i>and I lost my job,
because of you.</i>

15:31.398 --> 15:34.067
They're back.

15:34.067 --> 15:34.968
Shit.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.838
All right.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.907
What's the plan now?

15:40.907 --> 15:43.776
Oh, yes! My man!

15:44.811 --> 15:45.612
All right.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.749
I'll get back to you ASAP
with the details.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.251
<i>There ain't enough rocks
around here for them</i>

15:51.251 --> 15:52.152
<i>to crawl under.</i>

15:52.152 --> 15:53.420
<i>But I'll find 'em.</i>

15:56.123 --> 15:57.624
I will find them.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.462
All right. I got your back.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.597
You're a good man.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.147
Yeah.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.484
Yeah.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.459
Purrin' like a kitten.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.828
You are a remarkable woman.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.471
Tell me again how we first met.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.538
Oh, baby.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.474
I told you that story
a thousand times.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.343
Let's talk about our present
or our future.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.544
Tell me again!

16:54.013 --> 16:54.847
Well...

16:57.584 --> 16:59.886
when I turned 18,
and I could finally leave

16:59.886 --> 17:02.322
that damn foster home,
I went out.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.725
Saw a bit of the world.
Realized it wasn't for me.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.496
If I wasn't gonna be famous,
I was gonna be infamous.

17:09.496 --> 17:13.400
Well, my choice was obvious.
Serial murder.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.202
And then I met you.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.540
And you were the first girl
to make me feel special.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.544
So, I wanted to give you
something special.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.880
A piece of my heart,
you know?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.184
The knife I used
on my first kill.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.520
And you promised
you would keep it close

17:33.520 --> 17:34.721
to your heart...

17:37.056 --> 17:37.924
forever.

17:42.395 --> 17:42.895
Ooh!

17:48.768 --> 17:50.603
And then you told me

17:50.603 --> 17:53.072
about that mean,
old daddy of yours.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.544
And how he used to hurt you.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.441
What did my dad say?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.609
Who cares?

18:33.112 --> 18:35.815
I just knew I had to take care
of you.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.950
We'd be the darkest fairy tale
of all time.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.821
What would that fairy tale be?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.757
Oh, you know, boy meets girl.

18:44.757 --> 18:45.925
Girl meets boy.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.161
Boy and girl
fall desperately in love

18:48.161 --> 18:50.630
and kill as many people
as humanly possible.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.967
And live together
happily ever after in infamy.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.970
Johnny and Clyde forever.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.649
Okay.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.188
Good girl.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.696
Ah, fuck! You got my ear.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.699
Gee, goddammit!

20:03.236 --> 20:04.371
Again!

20:05.838 --> 20:07.740
- Oh, God!

20:09.208 --> 20:12.679
Baby, that's my ear.
You fucking caught my ear!

20:12.679 --> 20:14.414
- Aw!

20:16.383 --> 20:17.684
Kisses.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.519
Better?

20:19.519 --> 20:21.688
Mm. Mmhmm.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.889
Oh.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.891
Ooh.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.615
Again.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.270
Again.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.475
Where do we stand?

21:19.178 --> 21:22.782
Support team will land at 0800.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.817
Oh my God. Just give me
the fucking time, Guy.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.285
We're not on a naval ship.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.255
8:00 a.m., miss.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.189
Great.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.161
Miss.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.665
Yes?

21:38.665 --> 21:39.632
- Um...

21:39.632 --> 21:40.633
Don't you think that--

21:40.633 --> 21:42.101
You know what I hate, Guy?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.436
Do you know
what I fucking hate?

21:43.436 --> 21:47.139
Having to repeat myself.
Just make it happen.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.180
Why are you like that?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.516
Why do you look like that?
Are you nervous?

21:56.516 --> 21:58.351
No.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.285
Are you shaking?

21:59.285 --> 22:00.453
No.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.355
Are you scared?

22:02.355 --> 22:03.456
Of course, not.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.357
Okay.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.998
Honey Pot.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.301
Light up.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.044
Why are you still here?

22:26.413 --> 22:27.380
Why are you here?

22:27.380 --> 22:28.415
Forgive me, miss.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.922
Don't be such a baby!

22:38.725 --> 22:40.359
Fucking fun to do this.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.020
What the fuck is this?

23:16.429 --> 23:18.397
Hey, what's up, baby?
You need some help?

23:20.099 --> 23:21.734
Hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.302
What? What the fuck?
What are you doin'?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.072
Get back in the truck.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.441
We don't have time
for this bullshit.

23:28.441 --> 23:29.408
Hey, sweetie!

23:35.815 --> 23:37.550
Not the plan, El Ma!

23:37.550 --> 23:38.585
Not the plan at all.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.890
But you said
they both get out the car.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.224
I know, bubba. I'm sorry.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.893
- It's okay.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.095
It's okay.
The plan was to kill one.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.897
And have the other one
open the back for us,

23:50.897 --> 23:53.399
'cause it's probably locked.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.234
- Yeah?
- Oh!

23:55.234 --> 23:57.269
Let's see if the driver
has some keys, okay?

23:57.269 --> 23:57.937
Okay.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.472
Okay. Go on.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.415
Any keys, baby?

24:10.449 --> 24:11.918
Nada, babe.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.119
Goddammit!

24:16.623 --> 24:17.624
Just a quick little...

24:18.825 --> 24:19.959
idea here.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.934
Hey, guys!

24:27.934 --> 24:30.302
So, I got a bomb right here.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.371
What the fuck?

24:32.371 --> 24:34.106
Is that a fuckin' bomb?
Is that a fuckin' bomb?

24:34.106 --> 24:35.341
Now, you can either come out

24:35.341 --> 24:39.145
of the car or I can blow us
to kingdom fucking hell.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.980
Oh, what the fuck?

24:42.982 --> 24:43.983
I'm serious.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.119
It's okay-- Hey. No.
It's gonna work.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.121
It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.389
Come on. Okay? Look.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.394
Ooh!

25:14.380 --> 25:16.182
Jesus, fuck! Jesus, fuck!
Jesus, fuck! Jesus, fuck!

25:16.182 --> 25:18.017
No, no, no, no.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.556
You, on your knees.
On your knees, please.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.193
Please don't shoot him yet.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.198
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.666
Okay, what have we got here?

25:33.666 --> 25:34.567
Just fixing your hair.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.534
Okay.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.504
Motherfucker, no, no, no!

25:38.504 --> 25:39.505
Motherfucker!

25:39.505 --> 25:40.439
What is it, baby?

25:43.042 --> 25:47.079
Fuck! Fuck!

25:47.079 --> 25:48.915
- You think this is funny?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.720
It's just the fucking day drop.

25:56.522 --> 25:58.190
Shoot this unlucky fucker.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.558
No. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.427
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait!

26:03.529 --> 26:06.733
Don't--
don't you guys want money? Huh?

26:07.934 --> 26:09.535
Okay, yeah.
- I-- I can show you

26:09.535 --> 26:11.570
where all the fuckin' money
in the world is.

26:13.906 --> 26:14.874
I'm listening.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.876
But uh, you better
not fuck this up.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.377
It's gotta be some
Einstein-level shit.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.246
Okay, okay.
There is...

26:21.247 --> 26:23.482
a secret depository.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.452
It's called the cash room.

26:28.054 --> 26:31.724
It looks like a-- like a--
like a regular office building.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.059
It just happens to house

26:33.059 --> 26:35.561
the largest stash of cash
on the Eastern Seaboard.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.396
The casino transports
everything there.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.731
Everything.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.600
Um, anything off the books,
it goes there.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.070
- And the-- and the--

26:44.070 --> 26:45.437
...the funny thing is...

26:47.006 --> 26:48.641
It's--
it's not even that secure.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.077
Okay. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.646
Okay, that's--
that was actually interesting.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.783
So, uh, we're actually in a bit
of a compromising position

26:56.783 --> 26:59.819
here with all these dead bodies
on the side of the road,

26:59.819 --> 27:00.619
so, uh...

27:02.154 --> 27:03.289
get a toothbrush.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.291
What?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.834
You get the arms,
I get the legs.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.769
Just like we always do.

27:18.604 --> 27:19.638
Oh boy.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.293
Yes.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.662
There's a problem
with truck 84.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.466
Well, I don't know
what that means.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.836
So, you're gonna have to give me
more clarity than that, Guy.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.240
Do they have to be here?

27:55.341 --> 27:57.744
You know Honey Pot go
wherever I go.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.982
Truck 84 was ambushed.

28:02.982 --> 28:06.853
Failed robbery attempt.
Two men dead, one missing.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.356
Truck 84 had a coin delivery.

28:12.024 --> 28:16.262
I don't think we're dealing
with master criminals here.

28:17.864 --> 28:18.831
Okay.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.332
Well, what do you think
we're dealing with?

28:20.332 --> 28:22.334
Last night, Johnny and Clyde

28:22.334 --> 28:24.370
were seen traveling
up the interstate.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.206
Knocked over a gas station.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.542
Killed two men
less than an hour from here.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.613
Little too coincidental for me.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.218
I think it's romantic, no?

28:41.387 --> 28:44.891
Love and blood
lost on the open road.

28:46.258 --> 28:50.262
Two lunatics
on a cross-country kill tour,

28:54.733 --> 28:57.269
leaving behind a wake
of destroyed families

28:57.269 --> 28:59.371
and baffled lawmen,
only to return home

28:59.371 --> 29:02.574
for a victory lap.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.545
Very romantic, miss.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.747
Mm.
My team are all over it.

29:09.916 --> 29:10.783
No.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.420
Hey, get me my girl.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.056
Somebody,
get me my girl.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.290
Yes, miss.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.295
This could get messy.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.565
Messy is good for this.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.334
Messy is the opposite
of corporate

29:34.941 --> 29:38.444
Which means no one will suspect
that we're behind it.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.615
You catch on quick, Guy.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.688
Guy.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.627
I've been thinking about Bakwas.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.967
You don't want him on this.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.603
No.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.472
But keep him close just in case.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.463
<i>You have been a great audience.</i>

30:31.463 --> 30:34.666
<i>I have a very, very special item
for you.</i>

30:34.666 --> 30:36.468
<i>Lot 609.</i>

30:36.468 --> 30:40.139
<i>Undoubtedly, the only one
of its kind in the world,</i>

30:40.139 --> 30:42.141
<i>I'm offering to you tonight.</i>

30:42.141 --> 30:44.510
<i>Bidding will open at 500,000.</i>

30:44.510 --> 30:46.678
<i>500,000 is the bid.</i>

30:46.678 --> 30:48.647
5 million.

30:48.647 --> 30:49.848
<i>5 million?</i>

30:49.848 --> 30:52.518
<i>Thank you. 5 million.
5 million going once,</i>

30:52.518 --> 30:54.186
<i>5 million going twice.</i>

30:54.186 --> 30:57.856
Oh. Daddy likes. 9 million!

30:58.891 --> 31:00.726
<i>9 million on the table.</i>

31:00.726 --> 31:03.562
<i>9 million going once,
9 million going twice.</i>

31:04.563 --> 31:07.333
<i>9 million.
Sold to the gentleman.</i>

31:07.333 --> 31:09.168
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

31:09.168 --> 31:11.703
Oh, come to Papa.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.380
This is just marvelous.

31:37.696 --> 31:42.268
Get me my stone.
Get me my stone.

31:43.869 --> 31:47.706
I'll get you your fucking stone.
Get it?

31:47.706 --> 31:48.740
Shit!

31:55.747 --> 31:58.384
You crazy?
They have no magic!

31:58.384 --> 31:59.751
They're so ordinary.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.088
You're idiot.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.389
<i>What did you say?</i>

32:03.389 --> 32:04.223
Sorry, sorry I said that.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.424
I-- Just...

32:06.925 --> 32:09.428
I know you're the boss.
I listen to you, okay?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.596
Or maybe not!

32:11.763 --> 32:12.398
Fuck you.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.252
Wakey, wakey!

32:34.420 --> 32:35.621
Babe!

32:36.622 --> 32:37.956
Think you hit him too hard.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.292
Nah! He's all right. See.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.597
Can I try?

32:45.597 --> 32:47.599
Of course, El Ma.

32:47.599 --> 32:48.700
Give it a shot.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.140
She can fuckin' hit.

33:11.723 --> 33:12.858
Come on down here and hide.

33:12.858 --> 33:13.825
They're right over there.
I want you to see them.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.994
Come on. Shh! Keep it quiet!

33:17.829 --> 33:19.565
What's the deal
with the payment, Lock?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.634
I hate what this fucker
did to you.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.136
But like I told you in there...

33:24.136 --> 33:25.137
- Yeah.
- No more pro-bono.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.138
Yeah, I know.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.973
Here's 20 grand for now.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.508
Then you get to keep
whatever we find

33:29.508 --> 33:31.343
on Johnny's dead body,
all right,

33:31.343 --> 33:32.678
which should be a bundle.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.814
- All right.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.583
Well, you go yourself
a desperado.

33:39.518 --> 33:42.054
Are we waiting until
they come out and ice city,

33:42.054 --> 33:44.156
or we gonna bust in
and light the motherfuckers up?

33:44.156 --> 33:45.857
No, no, no, no. We wait.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.693
We knock on the door,
do something like that,

33:47.693 --> 33:49.027
it's gonna get all messy.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.001
So...

33:56.001 --> 33:59.004
all you have to do is tell me
everything that you know

33:59.004 --> 34:02.741
about this place and then--
Thank you, sweetheart.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.246
You get to go home,
to the nice, happy family

34:07.246 --> 34:08.414
in the photograph.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.183
Okay? Look at me.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.384
Careful.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.019
If, uh...

34:14.019 --> 34:17.689
If you make one little mistake,
forget to tell me something,

34:17.689 --> 34:21.593
or uh, make up some shit
that gets me fucked,

34:21.593 --> 34:24.230
me and Clyde here
are gonna go down

34:24.230 --> 34:27.899
to 85 Angel Briar and Cranston.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.103
We're going to
introduce ourselves

34:31.103 --> 34:32.538
to the family.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.039
- Okay?

34:34.039 --> 34:35.874
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.243
All right.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.244
So...

34:39.611 --> 34:40.746
here we go.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.217
Oh, oh, God. Oh, God.

34:46.885 --> 34:50.556
Oh, oh. Oh. Oh, no, no.

34:50.556 --> 34:51.890
That's disgusting, man.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.459
All I was gonna do
is free your hands,

34:53.459 --> 34:54.926
so you could draw us a map.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.729
I fuckin' hate pee-ers.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.435
You always get the pee-ers.

35:05.471 --> 35:06.638
It's disgusting.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.575
Stop being so dramatic.

35:09.575 --> 35:10.576
You animal!

35:16.114 --> 35:17.115
Okay.

35:18.284 --> 35:22.588
So, what happens now
is you are going to draw us

35:22.588 --> 35:24.256
a little map.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.791
With all little guards on it.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.829
Okay? If you do that,
I'm gonna let you live.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.431
Okay.
- That sound right?

35:32.431 --> 35:34.266
Y-- yes.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.100
Okay. Go on.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.203
Go on!

35:40.105 --> 35:41.773
Okay. Okay.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.008
- Come on, Cliff boy! Come on!

35:43.008 --> 35:45.110
Okay, okay. Fuck!

35:50.849 --> 35:52.318
Oh.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.654
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Go on then.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.656
There's, um...

36:00.526 --> 36:02.027
a safety deposit box.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.832
By the-- the inside gate.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.670
There's two in the cash room.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.174
And one guy, he's-- he's in--
he's in charge.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.876
He just-- he...

36:17.876 --> 36:21.913
walks around,
just doing perimeter checks.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.551
That's a lot of guys.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.487
Yeah.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.489
That is a lot of guys,
isn't it?

36:34.192 --> 36:38.163
Butcher, Baker,
and the Candlestick maker?

36:38.163 --> 36:39.731
Uh-huh!

36:41.367 --> 36:43.168
All right. On three.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.670
One.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.238
Two-- oh.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.008
Geez!

36:50.008 --> 36:51.343
Come on.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.345
- Come on.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.247
Move!

36:55.247 --> 36:56.682
Fuck! Shit!

37:08.059 --> 37:10.296
Funny, Johnny! Very funny!

37:13.732 --> 37:15.033
Hi, Lock!

37:16.702 --> 37:18.737
Come on, Johnny.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.238
Let's make this easy, huh?

37:21.740 --> 37:25.377
How about no prison? Yeah.
Fuck that!

37:25.377 --> 37:26.378
What do you say, huh?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.459
You gonna die no matter what.

37:55.674 --> 37:56.742
Who the hell is that?

37:56.742 --> 37:57.576
Does it matter?

37:57.576 --> 37:58.944
They're fuckin' shooting at us!

38:01.947 --> 38:02.914
Get in, baby.

38:09.955 --> 38:10.989
Get him!

38:17.629 --> 38:19.465
Who the hell was that?

38:19.465 --> 38:20.599
I have no idea.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.002
What?

38:57.002 --> 38:58.837
I'm afraid, uh, bad news.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.340
It's...

39:04.510 --> 39:05.544
it's Zhang.

39:45.551 --> 39:46.852
Hey, darling.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.857
They have no clue.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.892
The stone was very close.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.696
Shall we engage?

40:18.383 --> 40:19.384
Mm?

40:25.924 --> 40:26.892
Mm.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.610

Oh, Johnny!

41:23.148 --> 41:24.449
Hey, little fella!

41:24.449 --> 41:25.984
Great to see you.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.619
Hey, Clyde.

41:27.619 --> 41:28.820
Howdy.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.622
So...

41:30.622 --> 41:31.957
whatcha up to?

41:31.957 --> 41:34.025
Been gambling a lot.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.661
Well, it's funny
that you should say "gambling"

41:35.661 --> 41:38.830
because me and Clyde here,
we're gonna rip off a casino.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.998
You want in?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.500
Do I get to kill people?

41:44.002 --> 41:46.004
Honey,
I double-damn guarantee it.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.375
Oh, before I can commit,

41:50.375 --> 41:52.477
I need to ask you
a very important question.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.013
Left or right?

41:56.347 --> 41:57.883
Huh?

41:57.883 --> 41:59.585
Just real quick.
Left or right?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.989
Left.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.190
Okay.

42:22.407 --> 42:23.374
Okay, I'm in.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.710
Yay!
- Oh, great!

42:30.215 --> 42:31.416
Uh, hey, big guy?

42:32.751 --> 42:34.586
Seen much of Baker these days?

42:34.586 --> 42:36.855
Oh, shit. You didn't hear.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.537
<i>♪ I would rather be a pencil
than a pencil case ♪</i>

42:52.537 --> 42:55.473

42:58.409 --> 42:59.544
Oh.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.080
That's Baker.

43:26.071 --> 43:26.738
Whoo!

43:52.130 --> 43:53.765
No.

43:53.765 --> 43:57.268
This is so boring.
Who is picking this shit out?

43:57.268 --> 43:58.804
Who is doing this to me?

43:58.804 --> 44:01.139
Because this is my free time.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.308
I don't have time for this shit.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.109
No.

44:04.109 --> 44:05.443
Go, change.

44:05.443 --> 44:07.679
Let's make it worth it.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.614
I don't know what the fuck
you were so happy about.

44:09.614 --> 44:10.949
You should have known
when you looked in the mirror

44:10.949 --> 44:14.686
that that wasn't it.
Not a vibe. Next.

44:22.160 --> 44:25.296
Oh my God!

44:25.296 --> 44:28.166
Sweet Jesus!
This is what I'm talking about.

44:28.166 --> 44:31.336
Look at this. Holy shit, yes!
Mm.

44:34.539 --> 44:35.506
I love it.

44:36.674 --> 44:38.176
Uh, one second.

44:40.378 --> 44:41.679
Can you give us a minute?

44:44.182 --> 44:45.250
Did I say, leave?

44:46.517 --> 44:48.419
Or did I say,
"Give us a minute"?

44:52.824 --> 44:54.359
Okay. Let's do it.

44:55.260 --> 44:57.695
Daddy? I have great news.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.198
Make it fast. Daddy's busy.

45:00.198 --> 45:03.501
Well, profits
have never been better.

45:03.501 --> 45:06.037
And yes, we did hit
a few hiccups along the way,

45:06.037 --> 45:07.672
but that is all smoothed out now.

45:07.672 --> 45:11.342
<i>What did you do
about Johnny and Clyde?</i>

45:11.342 --> 45:13.278
Well, they're just zits
waiting to be popped.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.714
<i>Always something with you.</i>

45:18.616 --> 45:20.886
Daddy, sir, um...

45:22.287 --> 45:23.388
I was thinking...

45:24.890 --> 45:26.057
I've been here for a few years.

45:26.057 --> 45:29.194
And I have turned this dusty,
shit place

45:29.194 --> 45:32.263
into a world-class resort, and...

45:32.263 --> 45:35.233
maybe it's time
that I could come home,

45:35.233 --> 45:36.234
you know?

45:36.234 --> 45:39.404
I really miss you.
I miss Vegas.

45:39.404 --> 45:40.371
You made a mess.

45:40.371 --> 45:41.606
Now, clean it up.

45:41.606 --> 45:44.275
<i>And then, and only then
can you come home.</i>

45:44.275 --> 45:45.911
I won't let you down.

45:45.911 --> 45:47.078
<i>And Alana, darling?</i>

45:47.078 --> 45:48.279
Yes, Daddy?

45:48.279 --> 45:49.647
<i>I know everything.</i>

45:51.249 --> 45:53.051
Of course, you do.

45:53.051 --> 45:54.719
<i>No mistakes, right?</i>

45:54.719 --> 45:56.487
Bye, Daddy. I love-- oh.

45:59.925 --> 46:02.060
Get fucking dressed!

46:02.060 --> 46:03.328
What the fuck?

46:04.762 --> 46:05.630
Fucking work.

46:05.630 --> 46:06.597
I'm only the fucking person
that works

46:06.597 --> 46:08.766
in this goddamn
fucking bullshit.

46:14.906 --> 46:16.741
So...

46:16.741 --> 46:19.945
I think the word
I'm looking for...

46:23.114 --> 46:24.615
is respect.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.753
Or really
it's a lack thereof it.

46:30.621 --> 46:32.623
Now, one of you...

46:33.791 --> 46:35.961
has been stealing my newspaper.

46:37.963 --> 46:41.967
Now, I know it's been
a long three days.

46:41.967 --> 46:43.969
And two of you did nothin'.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.274
Now, you...

46:49.274 --> 46:50.842
you think I don't know.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.947
Oh, but I do. Oh, I do.

46:55.947 --> 46:59.550
And if you don't answer me,
all three of you get gutted.

47:00.485 --> 47:03.454
Now, can you please spare
your pals

47:03.454 --> 47:05.123
and cop to what you did?

47:06.524 --> 47:10.495
Sir, please look at him!
He's been dead for two days!

47:16.167 --> 47:17.502
So he is.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.139
But if this is some kind
of trick,

47:21.139 --> 47:22.640
I will fucking gut you.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.314
You're not even on my route!

47:29.314 --> 47:31.983
I don't even think
you're a subscriber.

47:39.690 --> 47:40.691
Shh!

47:51.402 --> 47:53.371
Well, no answer. Let's go.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.340
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.375
I think I hear some movement
around there.

47:59.710 --> 48:02.080
- Oh, God! Son of a bitch.
He's home.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.919
I told you,
if I saw you again,

48:09.054 --> 48:10.755
I'd--

48:10.755 --> 48:13.024
I'd give you the biggest
fricking hug.

48:16.261 --> 48:18.196
Oh, it's good to see you.
- Oh, there she is.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.866
Holy shit!
The whole gang's here.

48:21.866 --> 48:22.733
Baker, Butcher!

48:22.733 --> 48:23.868
- Now, what the hell

48:23.868 --> 48:25.603
in God's name
y'all doin' out here?

48:25.603 --> 48:28.373
Well, we got a little job
for you if you're interested.

48:28.373 --> 48:29.907
- It's a--
- Hell, yeah, papito. I'm in.

48:31.242 --> 48:32.543
Yeah. Well, I didn't even
get to tell you about--

48:32.543 --> 48:33.878
Well, fuck that shit, homes.

48:33.878 --> 48:35.280
I'm in. So, come on in.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.214
Hey!

48:38.083 --> 48:39.550
Whoa! You, uh-- you got---

48:39.550 --> 48:40.751
No, no, no, no, no, no.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.553
They just left. They just
left. No, no, no, no, amigo.

48:42.553 --> 48:43.554
Come on, please. Please.

48:45.056 --> 48:45.656
Come on. Come on.

48:45.656 --> 48:46.958
Oh, it's cool.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.901
What are we stealing?

49:00.105 --> 49:01.606
Who we killing?

49:01.606 --> 49:03.241
Hopefully, all of the above, chico.

49:03.241 --> 49:04.409
- Yes!
Yes!

49:05.910 --> 49:06.444
Chico!

49:15.486 --> 49:17.989
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

49:19.957 --> 49:22.593
Oh. Sheriff Lock.

49:22.593 --> 49:24.829
How nice to finally meet you
in person.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.464
It's just Lock.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.633
You know I'm not sheriff anymore.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.801
I do.

49:39.010 --> 49:41.979
Miss, are you okay?

49:41.979 --> 49:42.980
I'm fine, Guy.

49:42.980 --> 49:46.117
I'm pretty sure Mr. Lock
is gonna behave himself.

49:46.117 --> 49:48.053
Yeah, I'll be a good boy.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.557
We're good, Guy. Goodbye.

49:54.525 --> 49:55.726
Pick his ass up.

49:56.661 --> 49:57.628
You wanna sit down?

50:10.341 --> 50:11.576
Well?

50:12.510 --> 50:14.812
I'll be quick.

50:14.812 --> 50:18.849
Two years ago,
Johnny and Clyde killed my kid.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.985
My, uh...

50:20.985 --> 50:22.320
daughter.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.821
Mmhmm.

50:23.821 --> 50:26.857
And then your wife left.
And then you started drinking.

50:26.857 --> 50:27.825
A lot.

50:27.825 --> 50:29.160
Combination of that
and obsession

50:29.160 --> 50:31.496
with your daughter's killer,
abused some power,

50:31.496 --> 50:32.663
broke some rules,

50:32.663 --> 50:33.998
got booted
from the police department.

50:33.998 --> 50:35.666
It's a painfully tragic,

50:35.666 --> 50:38.069
weirdly common tale
of a wayward lawman.

50:40.538 --> 50:41.772
Point, please.

50:43.541 --> 50:44.842
Those two shitbums

50:44.842 --> 50:47.945
that killed my little girl
are gonna hit your safe.

50:51.749 --> 50:54.018
Well, that would be
awfully foolish,

50:54.018 --> 50:56.854
because we have the best
security in the world.

50:56.854 --> 50:59.924
Oh, no. Not that safe.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.561
The one no one knows about.

51:07.898 --> 51:08.533
Yeah!

51:10.868 --> 51:11.869
That one.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.742
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

51:19.410 --> 51:20.745
I'm sure you do.

51:24.449 --> 51:26.417
Are you alone, Mr. Lock?

51:26.417 --> 51:29.254
Hmm! Maybe.

51:38.163 --> 51:39.096
Maybe not.

51:46.271 --> 51:47.172
What do you want?

51:48.273 --> 51:49.940
How about a team-up?

51:49.940 --> 51:52.743
I can handle this
before it ever starts.

51:52.743 --> 51:54.579
Oh my God. That's super cute.

51:54.579 --> 51:56.147
You guys, he wants a job.

51:56.147 --> 51:58.249
No, no, no, no.
I don't want anything from you.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.285
Just first dibs
on doing Johnny and Clyde.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.020
That's my fee.

52:09.126 --> 52:10.795
Mm...

52:13.130 --> 52:14.632
okay.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.602
Oh, nice.

52:17.602 --> 52:18.936
I can get movin' on right away.

52:18.936 --> 52:20.605
- I'll get beatin' down
on those two pieces of shit.
- Guy.

52:20.605 --> 52:21.506
Guy.

52:21.506 --> 52:23.341
You have no idea
just how miserable

52:23.341 --> 52:24.609
I'm gonna make their lives.

52:24.609 --> 52:26.010
What are you doing?

52:26.010 --> 52:29.780
Oh, come on. Come on.
This is not necessary, is it?

52:29.780 --> 52:31.782
You don't have to--
You don't-- hey, hey, hey!

52:31.782 --> 52:33.618
Oh! Come on!

52:33.618 --> 52:35.186
Hey, fuck off!

52:37.655 --> 52:40.458
We don't use that kind
of language around here.

52:40.458 --> 52:41.792
Well, suck my dick, motherfucker.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.994
How's that for--

52:46.864 --> 52:49.300
All right. Leavin'.
I'm leavin'.

52:49.300 --> 52:50.335
Oh, shit.

52:52.337 --> 52:54.539
You got no fuckin' clue
what you're dealing with.

52:54.539 --> 52:55.806
All right?

52:55.806 --> 52:57.174
I think we'll be fine.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.177
Fuck me. Don't touch me, pal.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.851
We'll escort him
off the property.

53:07.718 --> 53:08.986
No.

53:08.986 --> 53:10.988
What you're gonna do is line
all these little shits up

53:10.988 --> 53:12.022
and flush.

53:14.525 --> 53:15.693
Of course, miss.

53:18.596 --> 53:19.697
Guy.

53:21.432 --> 53:22.367
Call the Elder.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.036
I want Bakwas.

53:33.744 --> 53:36.013
...In that casino
just so happens

53:36.013 --> 53:39.750
to be on the same grounds where
the Infernal Order of Light

53:39.750 --> 53:41.686
performed their mass suicide, bro,

53:41.686 --> 53:44.355
which means it's protected
by the Bakwas.

53:44.355 --> 53:45.856
Okay, what the fuck is a Bakwas?

53:45.856 --> 53:47.858
What the fuck
is the Infernal Order of Light?

53:47.858 --> 53:49.527
Yo!

53:49.527 --> 53:51.362
The Bakwas
and the Infernal Order

53:51.362 --> 53:53.398
are the first fuckin'
documented Satanists to land

53:53.398 --> 53:55.199
in America, bro.

53:55.199 --> 53:56.233
Uh-huh.

53:57.234 --> 53:59.704
And I love you,
but this is just a bullshit

53:59.704 --> 54:02.206
ghost story
to scare children, right?

54:02.206 --> 54:03.040
It's-- it's, uh--

54:03.040 --> 54:04.942
Completely fuckin' true, yo!

54:21.258 --> 54:22.560
Okay.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.161
He's gotten a little crazier
since the last time I saw him.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.231
The wig is new.

54:37.975 --> 54:39.143
What the fuck is he doing?

54:42.613 --> 54:44.315
I told y'all.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.793
Man, these cats were
into some dark shit.

54:57.628 --> 54:58.929
There's more to the story?

54:58.929 --> 55:00.431
BUTCHER, BAKER AND CLYDE:
Shh!

55:00.431 --> 55:02.132
All right. Fine. Fuck it.

55:04.869 --> 55:06.270
The pilgrims landed in Plymouth

55:06.270 --> 55:09.106
in 1620,
seeking religious freedom.

55:09.106 --> 55:13.277
But in 1625,
a different group came over,

55:13.277 --> 55:15.980
also seeking
some religious freedom.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.516
Hmm.

55:18.516 --> 55:20.117
A Satanic cult.

55:20.117 --> 55:21.452
Oh, fuck.

55:21.452 --> 55:23.020
Yeah.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.822
Now, the colonies
were fuckin' booming.

55:25.990 --> 55:28.626
Not knowing these crazy
fuckin' Satanists

55:28.626 --> 55:29.994
were just
a spittin' distance away.

55:34.064 --> 55:37.001
Well, the townspeople
figured it out.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.036
And they formed a posse

55:39.036 --> 55:40.671
to rid the order
from their lands.

55:43.207 --> 55:45.976
But The Infernal order
knew the people were coming.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.344
So, you know what they did?

55:47.344 --> 55:49.547
They lined 'em up, and they
burned 'em at the stake.

55:49.547 --> 55:51.315
They tried.

55:51.315 --> 55:52.349
Before they could...

55:53.418 --> 55:54.519
the entire cult...

55:57.021 --> 55:58.489
stood in a giant circle.

55:59.990 --> 56:02.092
And they all ceremoniously...

56:03.894 --> 56:05.563
slit their own throats.

56:05.563 --> 56:06.531
Oh.

56:08.265 --> 56:09.500
Wait.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.836
Why-- why did the whole cult
have to kill themselves?

56:11.836 --> 56:15.272
Suffering, pain, and hate!

56:17.708 --> 56:18.576
Blood...

56:19.777 --> 56:21.679
and the tears...

56:21.679 --> 56:22.880
of the fallen.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.918
It pooled,
and it created a massive death.

56:28.886 --> 56:30.087
A god they worshipped.

56:33.624 --> 56:34.559
Their god of death.

56:39.229 --> 56:41.699
Before you see him,
you can hear children...

56:43.534 --> 56:45.035
...weeping.

56:45.035 --> 56:46.537
You know, like a...

56:46.537 --> 56:48.038
like a warning.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.607
Okay. I'll be taking me
back to the nuthouse.

56:49.607 --> 56:51.375
No, no, no. Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Shh, shh.

56:51.375 --> 56:52.877
He's just a little...

56:52.877 --> 56:54.612
He's just--
he's just bein' fun, right?

56:55.980 --> 56:57.582
Shit's real, dude.

56:57.582 --> 56:58.583
I believe you.

56:58.583 --> 57:00.084
Me, too.

57:00.084 --> 57:02.419
- Yeah. Me fuckin' three,
which is why I'm out.
- All right.

57:04.922 --> 57:07.057
I'll live to blow shit up
another day.

57:07.057 --> 57:09.226
You talkin' about cameras,
armed guards,

57:09.226 --> 57:11.562
and fuckin' ghost killers
runnin' around here,

57:11.562 --> 57:14.732
I might be the fuck crazy,
but I'm not stupid.

57:14.732 --> 57:15.733
I'm-- I'm done.

57:15.733 --> 57:17.067
No, no, no. Look.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.235
Baker, Baker, Baker, Baker,
please, please, please.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.970
- I'm done.
- Please, please, please, please.

57:19.970 --> 57:22.507
Brother, brother, brother.
We need you.

57:24.742 --> 57:27.411
Trust me.
None of us want to die.

57:27.411 --> 57:28.579
I kinda do!

57:28.579 --> 57:30.447
- Will you please shh, shh, shh.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.316
Baker, Baker. Look at me.

57:32.316 --> 57:34.318
This is so fuckin' stupid, bro.

57:37.454 --> 57:38.756
So, you said

57:38.756 --> 57:41.458
you hear little kids crying
before he comes to kill you?

57:44.629 --> 57:47.131
It's enough to make you
piss your pants, huh.

57:47.131 --> 57:48.098
Shh.

57:48.098 --> 57:49.967
Well, this is so fucking stupid, man.

57:52.603 --> 57:54.471
- But?
And?

57:57.307 --> 57:58.609
- Fine, man.
- Hey!

58:02.112 --> 58:02.847
This guy's...

58:04.448 --> 58:06.483
What the fuck is he doing now?

58:09.954 --> 58:11.288
You guys want some drugs?

58:16.226 --> 58:16.994
Whoo!

59:13.183 --> 59:14.752
Oh, you got pumped too good
for you.

59:16.186 --> 59:17.387
Eat the cookie, homie.

1:00:17.782 --> 1:00:18.783
It is done.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:24.454
Bakwas will remain
until all are dead.

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:28.292
How long will Bakwas
be in my control?

1:00:31.295 --> 1:00:33.163
Uh, Bakwas will obey

1:00:34.364 --> 1:00:38.468
and cannot leave casino grounds
while you possess the stone.

1:00:39.970 --> 1:00:41.371
I feel I must warn you.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:46.443
Bakwas was our cult's
most ferocious

1:00:46.443 --> 1:00:48.112
and glorious warrior.

1:00:48.112 --> 1:00:51.481
But over time,
he has grown full of rage

1:00:53.150 --> 1:00:58.188
and has become erratic
and unpredictable.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:01.458
Have you told any of your people
that I have the stone?

1:01:01.458 --> 1:01:03.160
Of course, not.

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:07.798
My order would excommunicate me
if they knew

1:01:07.798 --> 1:01:09.867
I was talking to you
and not your father.

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:14.739
So, you're the only one
who knows?

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:17.174
It's our little secret.

1:01:19.009 --> 1:01:20.177
Mm, great.

1:01:24.381 --> 1:01:26.851
Two can keep a secret
if one of you is dead.

1:01:46.370 --> 1:01:47.537
Good morning, miss.

1:01:49.373 --> 1:01:51.541
Everything is in place
for today, miss.

1:01:53.077 --> 1:01:54.378
Wonderful.

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:57.214
It's just...

1:01:58.082 --> 1:01:59.716
I-- I just, uh...

1:02:01.118 --> 1:02:03.553
didn't see the stone.

1:02:05.956 --> 1:02:07.357
Okay.

1:02:07.357 --> 1:02:09.559
And why pray tell
were you looking for the stone?

1:02:11.295 --> 1:02:14.631
I just wanted to ensure
its safety.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:18.903
You just are very lucky
that I'm in a good mood today.

1:02:20.070 --> 1:02:21.738
The stone
is with me at all times.

1:02:24.274 --> 1:02:25.409
Of course.

1:02:26.911 --> 1:02:28.378
Please feel free.

1:02:28.378 --> 1:02:30.280
- Don't straighten up.
It's all good.
Uh, yes.

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:32.049
Please feel free
to find your way out.

1:02:32.049 --> 1:02:34.218
I just--
- Mmhmm.

1:02:42.259 --> 1:02:45.896
So, here is the basic idea.

1:02:45.896 --> 1:02:47.898
There are three floors.

1:02:47.898 --> 1:02:51.268
We're gonna get in,
we're gonna go to the basement,

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.070
and we're gonna get the money,

1:02:53.070 --> 1:02:55.806
and then we're gonna come back
out the way we came.

1:02:55.806 --> 1:02:57.407
That's it?

1:02:57.407 --> 1:02:59.309
- That's the fucking plan?
Yeah!

1:02:59.309 --> 1:03:00.744
- It sounds great, John.

1:03:00.744 --> 1:03:02.279
Yeah.

1:03:02.279 --> 1:03:03.580
That's a horrible fuckin' plan.

1:03:03.580 --> 1:03:05.249
What-- what about the guards?

1:03:05.249 --> 1:03:06.583
Oh, a few guards.

1:03:06.583 --> 1:03:10.988
One here, uh, here.
Yeah. Couple of guards.

1:03:10.988 --> 1:03:11.989
And?

1:03:11.989 --> 1:03:13.590
And...

1:03:13.590 --> 1:03:15.325
w-- what the fuck do you mean
"and"?

1:03:15.325 --> 1:03:16.927
- We gotta kill 'em.

1:03:18.162 --> 1:03:20.998
Listen, Baker. Relax, man.

1:03:20.998 --> 1:03:22.266
I'm not taking this lightly.

1:03:22.266 --> 1:03:24.768
It just so happens,
it's a very simple job.

1:03:24.768 --> 1:03:28.472
But just to clarify,
here it goes.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.977
Clyde and I quietly take out
the guards.

1:03:38.482 --> 1:03:41.318
And then Baker blows the doors.

1:03:43.487 --> 1:03:45.956
And that's when the guards
come in.

1:03:53.998 --> 1:03:56.833
And then Candle
is gonna crack the safe.

1:03:58.002 --> 1:03:59.503
Wait. Wait, wait. John.

1:03:59.503 --> 1:04:00.971
I don't know
how to crack a safe.

1:04:00.971 --> 1:04:02.006
Oh, that's okay, buddy.

1:04:02.006 --> 1:04:03.307
We're gonna work it out.
We're gonna work it out.

1:04:03.307 --> 1:04:05.509
- But I--
- He's gonna do fine, isn't he?

1:04:09.379 --> 1:04:10.680
We get the money.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:13.017
And we live happily ever after.

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:20.390
The fuckin' end.

1:04:22.759 --> 1:04:24.328
It's not remotely gonna go
like that.

1:04:24.328 --> 1:04:25.829
And you know that.

1:04:25.829 --> 1:04:28.498
It's called,
"positive manifestation", Baker.

1:04:28.498 --> 1:04:29.666
- You ain't never read
The Secret?

1:04:29.666 --> 1:04:30.734
Oh, you gotta read it.

1:04:30.734 --> 1:04:33.037
It's so empowering.
You gotta read it.

1:04:33.037 --> 1:04:34.838
Johnny,
do y'all even have guns?

1:04:34.838 --> 1:04:37.874
I've seen one pistol
this entire time.

1:04:40.677 --> 1:04:43.047
The fuck is so funny?

1:04:44.581 --> 1:04:46.583
Well, I don't know.

1:04:46.583 --> 1:04:50.387
Do we got guns,
or you got guns?

1:04:54.391 --> 1:04:57.094
- Oh, yeah.
Now, that'll do nicely.

1:04:57.094 --> 1:04:58.862
I love you, Johnny.

1:04:58.862 --> 1:05:00.364
Okay.

1:05:00.364 --> 1:05:03.033
We wait until they file in.
And then we go--

1:05:03.033 --> 1:05:04.034
Coming through

1:05:04.034 --> 1:05:06.703
the service entrance,
then we cut them off.

1:05:06.703 --> 1:05:08.538
I heard you the first time.

1:05:08.538 --> 1:05:10.540
- Yeah.
- I got you.

1:05:10.540 --> 1:05:12.076
All right. All right.

1:05:13.077 --> 1:05:14.411
Ooh!

1:05:15.479 --> 1:05:17.081
This is my joy!

1:05:18.282 --> 1:05:20.417
Ah!

1:05:21.585 --> 1:05:24.721
♪ We could be the future
together ♪

1:05:24.721 --> 1:05:26.056
Yeah.

1:05:26.056 --> 1:05:27.391
You hear that?

1:05:27.391 --> 1:05:29.293
Yeah, I can--

1:05:29.293 --> 1:05:30.727
- I feel it. Yeah.
- All right.

1:05:30.727 --> 1:05:32.296
Yeah.

1:05:32.296 --> 1:05:33.663
It's fight time.

1:05:34.431 --> 1:05:35.599
Yeah.

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:38.935
Let's go.

1:05:41.305 --> 1:05:45.009
♪ We could be the future
together ♪

1:05:46.143 --> 1:05:49.446
♪ Ridin' out

1:06:00.290 --> 1:06:01.925
No, no.

1:07:00.350 --> 1:07:02.586
I'm thinking we should leave.

1:07:11.261 --> 1:07:12.196
It's just...

1:07:13.863 --> 1:07:16.700
I only got room for one of you.
Here. Come, get a towel.

1:07:19.269 --> 1:07:20.704
The problem is...

1:07:21.905 --> 1:07:24.074
I can't decide
who's' gonna come,

1:07:24.074 --> 1:07:26.543
who's gonna stay.

1:07:27.877 --> 1:07:30.080
Uh, so, I think
I'll let you guys decide.

1:07:42.058 --> 1:07:43.227
Wow.

1:07:44.594 --> 1:07:48.031
I always knew
you were the strongest link.

1:07:48.031 --> 1:07:49.799
Good job, baby girl.

1:08:00.444 --> 1:08:02.912
Hi. Mm, yeah.

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:04.881
I'm gonna be needing
another pair.

1:08:04.881 --> 1:08:07.083
The last two you gave me...

1:08:08.285 --> 1:08:09.586
broke.

1:08:10.754 --> 1:08:12.722
Yeah, it's just that you got me
blonde last time.

1:08:12.722 --> 1:08:15.259
I don't-- okay, yeah.
Surprise me.

1:08:16.260 --> 1:08:17.394
Great.

1:08:17.394 --> 1:08:19.963
I'll let you know
where to ship them when I land.

1:08:36.146 --> 1:08:38.081
Okay. Just as we planned.

1:08:38.081 --> 1:08:39.949
Honey, I'm gonna need you to go
over there

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:41.918
and strut ass
as a distraction.

1:08:41.918 --> 1:08:43.753
I'm sorry,
it's very disrespectful.

1:08:43.753 --> 1:08:45.422
I apologize.

1:08:45.422 --> 1:08:46.290
It's for the money.

1:08:47.457 --> 1:08:48.592
That's right, baby.

1:08:48.592 --> 1:08:49.959
Where's Candle?

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:00.437
See, a fuckin' liability.

1:09:00.437 --> 1:09:02.639
Oh, stop. He's fun.

1:09:02.639 --> 1:09:04.107
Hey, John!

1:09:04.107 --> 1:09:06.109
I got the first two.

1:09:06.109 --> 1:09:07.344
All clear, buddy!

1:09:08.345 --> 1:09:09.713
Yeah, you did.

1:09:11.681 --> 1:09:13.116
- Okay, Baker.

1:09:13.116 --> 1:09:14.318
You're up.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.127
Okay.

1:09:24.127 --> 1:09:25.128
Blow this shit up.

1:09:25.128 --> 1:09:27.197
All right.
Let me just take a look.

1:09:32.836 --> 1:09:34.338
Steel door hinges.

1:09:35.505 --> 1:09:36.806
Now, that's cute.

1:09:36.806 --> 1:09:39.142
Nothing I can't get through, though.

1:09:39.142 --> 1:09:40.644
Hey, I put together
a little combo.

1:09:40.644 --> 1:09:42.846
A little, uh, gasoline,
black powder mix.

1:09:42.846 --> 1:09:44.648
Should definitely do the trick.

1:09:44.648 --> 1:09:46.683
Ah, fuse is too long.

1:09:49.819 --> 1:09:51.655
Yeah, you might wanna back up
at least 20 feet.

1:09:51.655 --> 1:09:53.690
And cover your ears.

1:09:57.894 --> 1:09:59.028
Hey, Baker.

1:10:00.297 --> 1:10:03.567
- You think that wick
might be a little too short?
- Mmhmm.

1:10:03.567 --> 1:10:04.834
Johnny.

1:10:04.834 --> 1:10:06.169
I've been doing this
for a while.

1:10:06.169 --> 1:10:08.104
Of course,
the wick is long enough.

1:10:12.376 --> 1:10:13.677
Okay.

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:29.526
Babe. This doesn't look
anything like your map.

1:10:29.526 --> 1:10:31.395
You know, I can't draw, baby.

1:10:33.229 --> 1:10:35.064
Drop it!

1:10:37.233 --> 1:10:38.868
Everybody's dying today.

1:10:38.868 --> 1:10:40.404
Fuck, yeah!

1:10:43.239 --> 1:10:45.241
- Hey, Butcher.
- Tell me that's your fucking girlfriend

1:10:45.241 --> 1:10:46.743
behind us right there.

1:10:46.743 --> 1:10:49.746
<i>Security lockdown enforced.</i>

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:54.551
<i>Hiya, folks!</i>

1:10:54.551 --> 1:10:55.885
<i>Eyes up here, please.</i>

1:10:55.885 --> 1:10:57.887
Sorry, you--
you're interrupting.

1:10:57.887 --> 1:10:59.889
Who the fuck are you?

1:10:59.889 --> 1:11:00.924
<i>The biggest mistake</i>

1:11:00.924 --> 1:11:03.460
<i>of your little shitty life, John.</i>

1:11:04.928 --> 1:11:06.129
- That's kinda hurtful.
- Mmhmm.

1:11:06.129 --> 1:11:07.564
I feel like that's
kinda hurtful.

1:11:07.564 --> 1:11:09.232
<i>Some of you came here for money.</i>

1:11:09.232 --> 1:11:11.067
<i>Some of you came here for glory.</i>

1:11:11.067 --> 1:11:13.069
<i>And some of you
came here for revenge.</i>

1:11:13.069 --> 1:11:14.771
But now, you're all trapped.

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:17.807
<i>You're all dead by sunrise.</i>

1:11:18.942 --> 1:11:19.909
Yay!

1:11:22.646 --> 1:11:25.114
<i>Now, because I'm a good sport</i>

1:11:25.114 --> 1:11:27.283
<i>and I wanna see
an even playing field,</i>

1:11:27.283 --> 1:11:29.586
<i>I'm gonna let you know
that the bottom floor</i>

1:11:29.586 --> 1:11:30.920
<i>is what you want.</i>

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.256
<i>There's more money there
than you will ever see</i>

1:11:33.256 --> 1:11:35.825
<i>in all of your combined lifetimes.</i>

1:11:35.825 --> 1:11:38.962
<i>If you can get to it,
it's all yours.</i>

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:41.798
Great! Thank you.

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:44.100
That sounds easy enough.

1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:45.769
<i>Well, you might not feel</i>

1:11:45.769 --> 1:11:48.304
<i>that way after you meet
our surprise guest.</i>

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:50.974
<i>Everybody, meet Bakwas.</i>

1:11:52.141 --> 1:11:53.377
Oh, shit.

1:12:00.817 --> 1:12:02.285
He's...

1:12:02.285 --> 1:12:03.620
Fucking...

1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:04.821
Real?

1:12:08.024 --> 1:12:10.293
All right, guys.
Let's kick rocks, kids!

1:12:10.293 --> 1:12:12.161
You're a dead man, Johnny!

1:12:23.507 --> 1:12:24.841
Shoot him!

1:12:26.543 --> 1:12:28.211
Shoot him again!

1:12:32.015 --> 1:12:34.384
Blow its fuckin' head up!

1:12:34.384 --> 1:12:37.220
Headshot! Head!

1:12:38.321 --> 1:12:40.156
One Time!

1:12:43.593 --> 1:12:46.863
Goodbye. Stay away the hell,
motherfucker!

1:12:47.864 --> 1:12:50.534
Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go.

1:12:54.704 --> 1:12:56.506
Ah.

1:12:56.506 --> 1:12:57.874
Thanks, El Ma.

1:13:07.083 --> 1:13:08.251
Hey guys, go, go.

1:13:09.419 --> 1:13:11.220
I got you.

1:13:17.561 --> 1:13:19.028
First floor, blue team.

1:13:19.028 --> 1:13:20.229
Targets are close.

1:13:21.565 --> 1:13:23.700
Soften them up.

1:13:23.700 --> 1:13:24.934
Copy that.

1:13:27.937 --> 1:13:29.573
Last seen in corridor C.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.542
We're at the last
point of entry, sir.

1:13:34.878 --> 1:13:36.713
Okay. I'm up.

1:13:38.214 --> 1:13:40.717
- Uh-huh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:13:40.717 --> 1:13:42.218
Let the boy do his thing.

1:13:44.821 --> 1:13:47.123
It's okay. It's okay.

1:13:52.428 --> 1:13:53.329
Hey, guys.

1:13:54.297 --> 1:13:58.568
Well, what are you waitin' for?

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:07.911
Oh!

1:14:21.024 --> 1:14:22.425
Look at me,
you son of a bitch.

1:14:49.886 --> 1:14:51.788
Hey, guys. We're good.

1:14:51.788 --> 1:14:53.657
Really great work, buddy.

1:14:53.657 --> 1:14:54.958
Yeah, wow.

1:14:54.958 --> 1:14:56.960
Butcher, I love you, too.

1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.294
I love you, too, man.

1:15:04.868 --> 1:15:06.335
Kill the scums.

1:15:09.338 --> 1:15:11.474
Okay, wow. All right. Gunfire.

1:15:11.474 --> 1:15:13.342
I got you.
We got a gunfight.

1:15:14.811 --> 1:15:16.479
Ah, come on, you fuckers.

1:15:16.479 --> 1:15:19.482
I'm open to suggestions
if anyone has any.

1:15:19.482 --> 1:15:20.516
You got a grenade?

1:15:22.686 --> 1:15:23.653
Nope.

1:15:38.001 --> 1:15:39.836
Oh, John, look. Holy shit.

1:16:09.599 --> 1:16:11.567
That guy's fuckin' sick.

1:16:13.903 --> 1:16:15.872
Wait, guys. Let's fuckin' go!

1:16:15.872 --> 1:16:17.707
Sick. Okay, let's go.

1:16:17.707 --> 1:16:18.608
Oh, shit.

1:16:25.581 --> 1:16:26.582
<i>Guy.</i>

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:33.256
Miss. Thank God you're okay.

1:16:34.123 --> 1:16:35.224
Well, Guy.

1:16:35.224 --> 1:16:36.893
I can hear
that you're out of breath.

1:16:36.893 --> 1:16:38.394
And I don't like that.

1:16:38.394 --> 1:16:40.563
<i>Are you fucking this up?</i>

1:16:40.563 --> 1:16:42.231
It's Bakwas.

1:16:42.231 --> 1:16:44.634
He's killing everyone
including our own men.

1:16:46.803 --> 1:16:48.772
This isn't the way
it was supposed to go down.

1:16:49.939 --> 1:16:52.075
<i>I'm beginning
to be very concerned</i>

1:16:52.075 --> 1:16:54.077
<i>for my own safety.</i>

1:16:54.077 --> 1:16:55.411
Yes. Of course,
you're scared.

1:16:55.411 --> 1:16:57.480
There's a mythical
demonic slasher

1:16:57.480 --> 1:16:59.282
chasing you around,
you should be.

1:17:00.784 --> 1:17:02.285
Miss.

1:17:02.285 --> 1:17:05.621
I'm afraid abandoning my post
is my only chance of survival.

1:17:08.024 --> 1:17:10.293
<i>I mean, you can try.</i>

1:17:10.293 --> 1:17:11.695
<i>You'll just never make it out.</i>

1:17:14.297 --> 1:17:16.299
It's not you, Guy. It's me.

1:17:17.333 --> 1:17:19.135
Is that what you needed to hear?

1:17:22.638 --> 1:17:24.273
<i>I sent Bakwas in
to clean all of this up</i>

1:17:24.273 --> 1:17:26.609
<i>with no witnesses.</i>

1:17:26.609 --> 1:17:28.144
<i>And sadly...</i>

1:17:30.013 --> 1:17:33.316
you're kind of a witness.

1:17:33.316 --> 1:17:35.952
After all I've done for you
over the years?

1:17:35.952 --> 1:17:38.454
You ungrateful bitch!

1:17:38.454 --> 1:17:39.823
Guy.

1:17:39.823 --> 1:17:41.357
Die with some dignity, would ya?

1:17:42.325 --> 1:17:44.460
<i>You have done a wonderful job.</i>

1:17:44.460 --> 1:17:46.329
I just don't need you anymore.

1:17:47.831 --> 1:17:48.832
<i>This isn't over.</i>

1:17:49.899 --> 1:17:51.300
I promise you that.

1:17:58.207 --> 1:18:00.977
- One, two...
- One, two, three!

1:18:00.977 --> 1:18:02.378
- Whoo!

1:18:03.847 --> 1:18:04.814
Come on, bitch!

1:18:12.856 --> 1:18:13.890
Candle, cover!

1:18:23.199 --> 1:18:24.834
Oh, no.

1:18:24.834 --> 1:18:26.502
No, no, no, no, no. Fuck!

1:18:26.502 --> 1:18:28.171
Oh, shit!

1:18:30.606 --> 1:18:31.707
Hey, hey.

1:18:34.043 --> 1:18:35.211
Butcher.

1:18:36.045 --> 1:18:37.013
Leave one alive.

1:18:37.013 --> 1:18:38.181
Candle, cover me!

1:18:38.181 --> 1:18:39.015
I got you, go!

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:46.722
It's okay. It's okay.

1:19:09.278 --> 1:19:11.380
You killed my girlfriend.

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:13.049
That's the only girl
I ever loved.

1:19:13.049 --> 1:19:15.551
And the only girl
who'll ever love me.

1:19:15.551 --> 1:19:16.452
So...

1:19:17.921 --> 1:19:18.822
What the fuck?

1:19:24.928 --> 1:19:26.062
I'm gonna make you pay for that.

1:19:28.097 --> 1:19:29.265
I got a question for you.

1:19:30.834 --> 1:19:31.801
Hands or feet?

1:19:33.436 --> 1:19:36.105
Nah. I'll answer
that question for ya.

1:19:50.119 --> 1:19:51.287
Shut the fuck up.

1:19:53.990 --> 1:19:55.624
El Ma.

1:19:55.624 --> 1:19:57.460
I thought you--
I thought you were dead.

1:19:57.460 --> 1:19:59.295
- I swear to God you died.

1:20:00.196 --> 1:20:03.099
Well, uh, you saved my life.

1:20:10.639 --> 1:20:12.842
I didn't know
what I was gonna do without you.

1:20:15.778 --> 1:20:16.980
Aw!

1:20:21.050 --> 1:20:22.018
I love you, Johnny.

1:20:22.018 --> 1:20:22.986
I love you, man.

1:20:32.195 --> 1:20:33.329
Soldiers

1:20:35.164 --> 1:20:38.834
Men, if you are still alive, flee.

1:20:40.503 --> 1:20:41.537
All is lost.

1:20:43.873 --> 1:20:46.009
If you see Bakwas, run.

1:20:47.343 --> 1:20:49.512
Or this place will be your tomb.

1:20:52.248 --> 1:20:55.351
This is team leader signing off.

1:20:56.419 --> 1:20:57.686
May God help you.

1:20:59.889 --> 1:21:01.157
Because no one else will.

1:21:13.702 --> 1:21:15.004
The money!

1:21:17.406 --> 1:21:18.908
Hey, Johnny.

1:21:18.908 --> 1:21:21.377
I'm gonna donate my portion
to the abused animals

1:21:21.377 --> 1:21:22.511
uh, foundation.

1:21:22.511 --> 1:21:24.613
That's so good.
- What?

1:21:37.460 --> 1:21:40.696
Well, I haven't felt that one.

1:21:40.696 --> 1:21:42.098
What's that, little guy?

1:21:42.098 --> 1:21:43.066
Fear.

1:21:46.535 --> 1:21:47.736
I got you.

1:21:47.736 --> 1:21:49.205
Can y'all stop fuckin' around?

1:21:49.205 --> 1:21:50.739
It's a little slippery
back here.

1:22:08.157 --> 1:22:09.092
What?

1:22:16.499 --> 1:22:18.101
The motherfucker's behind me, right?

1:22:22.605 --> 1:22:23.739
Go, go, go! Let's go!

1:22:23.739 --> 1:22:26.109
Candle! No!

1:22:38.621 --> 1:22:40.789
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Goodbye, my love.

1:22:40.789 --> 1:22:42.591
Come on, Butcher. Let's
go.

1:22:42.591 --> 1:22:45.794
Oh, come on. It's my time!

1:22:45.794 --> 1:22:48.464
- We're rich!
Let's kick rocks! Let's go!

1:22:57.473 --> 1:22:58.774
Okay.

1:22:58.774 --> 1:23:00.143
That should hold him
for a minute at least.

1:23:01.810 --> 1:23:02.845
Fuck.

1:23:02.845 --> 1:23:03.679
No. Come on, man.
You're fucking coming with us.

1:23:03.679 --> 1:23:05.148
No, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

1:23:06.815 --> 1:23:08.951
I don't like the world
very much, I never have.

1:23:09.785 --> 1:23:11.987
I'm just killin' time.

1:23:11.987 --> 1:23:12.855
When you guys came over,

1:23:12.855 --> 1:23:15.324
I was about to fucking kill myself

1:23:15.324 --> 1:23:16.825
out of shit fucking boredom.

1:23:17.993 --> 1:23:19.828
You gave me a purpose.

1:23:19.828 --> 1:23:21.497
Fucking quest!

1:23:21.497 --> 1:23:23.466
It was never about the money.

1:23:23.466 --> 1:23:28.137
It's about one last adventure
with my friends.

1:23:28.137 --> 1:23:29.172
And you gave me that.

1:23:30.539 --> 1:23:31.674
Thanks.

1:23:35.178 --> 1:23:37.146
You're welcome, man.

1:23:37.146 --> 1:23:38.181
Don't be sad.

1:23:39.582 --> 1:23:43.186
'Cause tonight,
I dine in Valhalla.

1:23:48.557 --> 1:23:51.660
Fuck! Go! Just go!

1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:52.728
And Johnny.

1:23:54.530 --> 1:23:56.499
Try not to be such an asshole.

1:23:56.499 --> 1:23:58.334
I'll try my best.

1:23:58.334 --> 1:23:59.502
I'll see you in Valhalla.

1:24:00.403 --> 1:24:02.238
Go. Clyde, take care of him.

1:24:02.238 --> 1:24:03.506
Okay.
- Let's go.

1:24:15.618 --> 1:24:17.786
There's always somebody better.

1:24:36.105 --> 1:24:37.240
You going easy on me?

1:25:36.999 --> 1:25:39.602
I think my time here is done, Father.

1:25:39.602 --> 1:25:42.037
Everything is wrapped up
and delivered as promised.

1:25:43.138 --> 1:25:44.507
Of course.

1:25:44.507 --> 1:25:45.441
That was all removed

1:25:45.441 --> 1:25:46.975
before those two clowns
got here.

1:25:49.712 --> 1:25:51.280
I took all the real money.

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:52.815
All that's left
is the counterfeit cash

1:25:52.815 --> 1:25:54.149
to buy us some time.

1:25:55.718 --> 1:25:59.988
♪ Oh my God, you're delicious

1:26:02.225 --> 1:26:06.229
♪ Paris, Monte Carlo
yum, yum, yum, yum, yum ♪

1:26:11.734 --> 1:26:13.135
See you in Vegas.

1:27:01.950 --> 1:27:04.353
So, you're just
not gonna kill us?

1:27:04.353 --> 1:27:05.921
I worked for Alana's father.

1:27:07.055 --> 1:27:07.856
Cool.

1:27:07.856 --> 1:27:09.358
Who the fuck's Alana?

1:27:09.358 --> 1:27:10.359
You don't remember?

1:27:10.359 --> 1:27:14.530
On big screen, the lady
who was telling you

1:27:14.530 --> 1:27:16.532
you're gonna die.

1:27:16.532 --> 1:27:18.701
Oh, yeah. I hated her.

1:27:18.701 --> 1:27:20.068
She was so rude.
Yeah.

1:27:20.068 --> 1:27:21.870
What's that crazy bitch's dad
gotta do with us?

1:27:21.870 --> 1:27:23.406
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

1:27:26.609 --> 1:27:28.377
He was watching
you two for a while.

1:27:28.377 --> 1:27:31.547
He was impressed, but not me.

1:27:31.547 --> 1:27:35.718
There's no magic.
Only ordinary.

1:27:35.718 --> 1:27:39.087
If not for him,
you'd both be dead.

1:27:40.623 --> 1:27:42.558
Motherfucker, come this way!
Go, go, go!

1:27:42.558 --> 1:27:43.892
Hey, baby.

1:27:43.892 --> 1:27:45.894
Baby, I think
she just called you "ordinary".

1:27:45.894 --> 1:27:47.330
Am I ordinary?

1:27:52.768 --> 1:27:54.069
Come on, hurry!

1:27:54.069 --> 1:27:56.939
From now on, your fuckin' fate
is connected to--

1:28:03.646 --> 1:28:05.280
Fuck! Fuckin'--

1:28:07.450 --> 1:28:09.585
You maggot motherfucker!

1:28:09.585 --> 1:28:10.419
- Fuck!

1:28:10.419 --> 1:28:12.455
You killed my little girl!

1:28:12.455 --> 1:28:13.956
Piece of shit!

1:28:13.956 --> 1:28:15.658
I killed a lot of people.

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:20.429
Red-leather-pant-wearing
motherfucker!

1:28:23.966 --> 1:28:25.133
Don't you--

1:28:26.301 --> 1:28:29.472
don't you ever wonder
why your dad never called?

1:28:31.474 --> 1:28:33.141
Because he didn't care.

1:28:33.141 --> 1:28:34.142
No.

1:28:35.844 --> 1:28:37.980
It's not because he didn't care.

1:28:39.014 --> 1:28:41.316
It's because he's dead.

1:28:42.385 --> 1:28:43.852
Johnny killed him.

1:28:44.887 --> 1:28:46.489
Johnny killed your dad.

1:28:47.990 --> 1:28:50.826
He had his pal
clean up his mess.

1:28:54.497 --> 1:28:55.297
Hey, Butcher.

1:28:55.297 --> 1:28:56.965
Thank God you picked up.
Hey, listen.

1:28:56.965 --> 1:28:59.134
Uh, I'm gonna need a little
clean-up job.

1:28:59.134 --> 1:29:00.836
You're gonna want to bring
some bleach.

1:29:02.371 --> 1:29:03.639
And some tarps.

1:29:03.639 --> 1:29:04.840
Put it all together.

1:29:04.840 --> 1:29:06.341
You're smart.

1:29:08.010 --> 1:29:11.514
Clyde, give me the gun.
Come on, honey.

1:29:11.514 --> 1:29:13.148
Give me the gun.

1:29:22.525 --> 1:29:25.360
Thanks, baby.
He was really fuckin' me up.

1:29:27.730 --> 1:29:28.997
Did you...

1:29:28.997 --> 1:29:31.033
did you really kill my dad?

1:29:33.436 --> 1:29:34.503
Yeah.

1:29:34.503 --> 1:29:35.871
Sorry about that.

1:29:40.443 --> 1:29:41.610
Hey.

1:29:41.610 --> 1:29:45.514
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1:29:54.222 --> 1:29:56.391
No time for love, Dr. Jones.

1:29:57.460 --> 1:29:58.561
Oh, fuck.

1:30:06.068 --> 1:30:07.603
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:30:09.271 --> 1:30:12.040
He can't fuckin' move.
He's reached the, uh...

1:30:12.040 --> 1:30:14.276
cult city limits or some shit.

1:30:14.276 --> 1:30:16.044
- Johnny, we gotta go.
- No, look at him.

1:30:16.044 --> 1:30:18.413
He can't move. We beat you!

1:30:20.983 --> 1:30:22.918
You Grim-Reaper-lookin'
motherfucker

1:30:22.918 --> 1:30:24.787
with your fuckin' poncho!

1:30:24.787 --> 1:30:25.888
You crusty-ass bitch!

1:30:27.055 --> 1:30:28.423
- You dried-up piece of shit!

1:30:31.627 --> 1:30:35.464
You know, it's funny
how life turns out sometimes.

1:30:35.464 --> 1:30:36.465
Yeah.

1:31:38.994 --> 1:31:41.997
I met Murder on the way.

1:31:44.199 --> 1:31:48.170
He had a mask like Castlereagh.

1:31:49.204 --> 1:31:53.208
Very smooth he looked,
yet grim.

1:31:55.844 --> 1:31:58.180
Seven bloodhounds followed him.

1:31:59.848 --> 1:32:03.418
One by one and two by two...

1:32:05.588 --> 1:32:09.357
he then tossed them
human hearts to chew.

1:32:10.726 --> 1:32:12.561
And then Anarchy

1:32:14.229 --> 1:32:18.667
rode and came on a white horse,

1:32:18.667 --> 1:32:20.402
splashed with blood.

1:32:24.039 --> 1:32:25.440
Very pale.

1:32:26.775 --> 1:32:28.543
He was very pale.

1:32:31.113 --> 1:32:35.383
Like death in the apocalypse.

1:33:00.375 --> 1:33:02.077
Guy, you survived.

1:33:02.077 --> 1:33:03.712
How wonderful!

1:33:03.712 --> 1:33:05.948
I always had faith
that you would persevere.

1:33:13.789 --> 1:33:15.423
The stone.

1:33:17.259 --> 1:33:18.661
Give it to me!

1:33:21.764 --> 1:33:23.165
Oh, is that all you want?

1:33:24.099 --> 1:33:25.467
Here.

1:33:32.107 --> 1:33:33.642
Ah!

1:33:41.850 --> 1:33:45.453
- There's someone else
who wants to see you.

1:33:51.593 --> 1:33:53.628
I, uh...

1:33:54.963 --> 1:33:56.464
You know who.

1:33:57.866 --> 1:33:59.267
Bakwas works for me.

1:33:59.267 --> 1:34:02.304
He does what I say.
And I say, to kill him.

1:34:04.139 --> 1:34:06.508
I have the stone.

1:34:07.509 --> 1:34:10.545
You don't control him anymore.

1:34:11.646 --> 1:34:12.314
Oh, fuck you.

1:34:12.314 --> 1:34:14.149
I said to kill Guy now!

1:35:02.530 --> 1:35:06.769
Things will be different
when I am in charge.

1:35:08.536 --> 1:35:12.540
We will treat you
with respect, dignity.

1:35:14.542 --> 1:35:17.079
