Ladies and gentlemen,

[scissors snipping]

00:42.660 --> 00:45.709
This is the city. Los Ange/es, Cal/forn/e.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.912
L/ke other great cities,
it is home to all kinds of schools

00:50.000 --> 00:52.207
where you can get
most any kind of education.

00:53.050 --> 00:56.884
All these schools are accredited.
There ’5 one that is not.

00:57.550 --> 01:00.553
It holds its classes
in the cracks and crevices of the city.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.098
Because of it; I have a job.
I carry a badge.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.550
It was Wednesday, December 17th.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.311
We were working the day watch out

"No, there's nothing inconspicuous here.

02:11.170 --> 02:14.048
We're all just gonna walk in together.
Is that okay?"

02:14.130 --> 02:16.621
[indistinct conversation continues]

02:16.710 --> 02:17.540
"Oh.

02:18.260 --> 02:22.799

03:39.050 --> 03:40.711
[woman on laptop]
You heard his story.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.371
You can ’t arrest a man
just because he doesn ’t talk.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.505
[Friday]
I’m afraid that was the trouble.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.000
[woman]
What do you mean by that?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.590

This should get it done. What you doing?
0w! Owl What the fuck are you doing?

04:04.360 --> 04:07.238

I’m just trying to see
ifMarty Byrde has some feelings.

what the plan is with Byrde.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.439
[Ruth]
Dude, what’s your deal?

04:11.540 --> 04:15.169
[Russ]
My deal is I want to stop wrp/ng
other people ’5 asses, final/y.

04:16.170 --> 04:19.128
Wyatt is smart; you know.
He could go to college.

04:19.210 --> 04:21.166
You want him saddled with that debt?

04:21.260 --> 04:23.467
[Ruth]
You bare/y care
ifhe goes to high school.

04:23.550 --> 04:26.007
[Russ]
He can miss a few days
with that brain of his.

04:26.510 --> 04:29.343
[Ruth]
If you want that cash so bad
you do it.

04:29.430 --> 04:32.172
[Russ]
But you were the one
who learned to clean it.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.760
[Petty moans]
- That was the whole plan.

04:34.350 --> 04:35.180

-[ Ruth ]
Get out of my way.

You ’re acting fucking weird.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.601
[Russ]
I just wanna make sure
you ’re holding up your end.

05:23.530 --> 05:24.736
[sighs]

05:31.830 --> 05:33.229
What are you guys doing?

05:33.330 --> 05:35.036
Maybe they'll get hungry.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.612
You think PETA came here
and let them roam free? They were stolen.

05:38.710 --> 05:40.666
[Wyatt] Who's coming here
to steal bobcats?

05:40.750 --> 05:44.459
I don't know, maybe someone with male cats
that can actually breed them.

05:45.050 --> 05:47.257
They were Dad and Uncle Boyd's.
It's bullshit.

05:51.510 --> 05:54.308
[Sam] You might feel alone in the world.

05:55.140 --> 05:58.018
But you just gotta ask yourself,

05:58.640 --> 06:00.767
why do you feel depressed?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.100
Because I'm here.

06:02.190 --> 06:05.353
[Sam] Okay, sir, just bear with me, okay?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.947
Why do you feel like a loser?

06:10.240 --> 06:13.983
Well, you know what?
It's a one-word answer. You.

06:14.580 --> 06:17.743
See, all that self-pity,
it just doesn't exist.

06:17.830 --> 06:19.206
It's all in your head.

06:19.290 --> 06:20.996
Now, see, he left because he couldn't take

06:21.080 --> 06:24.049
reality hitting him
with a cold smack in the face.

06:24.130 --> 06:26.758
Well, I'm that cold, hard smack
in the face.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.216
You have really found your calling.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.381
-You think?
-[Wendy] Mm-hmm.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.801
Well, I don't know what Mom would say.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.930
Man, the audience is growing.

06:44.980 --> 06:49.064
Hey, sorry about that heckler jerk.
That's rare.

06:49.150 --> 06:50.230
[chuckles]

06:51.240 --> 06:53.982
[stammering] I know
your business is really growing,

06:54.080 --> 06:56.230
but I was just wondering
how you might feel

06:56.330 --> 06:57.945
about making some supplemental income.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.076
For when you take the show on the road.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.913
Well, I don't want to be a "no" person
without hearing the offer first.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.413
As you say, "no" people miss out.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.582
[chuckles] You've been reading
my pamphlet.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.211
Who's better? Biggie or Tupac?

07:17.890 --> 07:20.222
I don't know. Tupac, I guess.

07:20.850 --> 07:23.011
No, it's Biggie.

07:23.520 --> 07:29.777
Did you know his parents are from Jamaica,
and he didn't write down his raps?

07:30.860 --> 07:34.944
-How do you know this stuff?
-From Ruth and Wikipedia.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.877
[Rachel] What's Charlotte doing out there?

07:48.750 --> 07:50.798
Uh, she is working here again.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.087
-It's the off-season. Not much to do.
-Mm-hmm.

07:53.180 --> 07:55.922
Well, better than the alternative,

07:56.010 --> 07:59.013
which consisted
of her qUIttIng the SWlm team

07:59.100 --> 08:01.011
so she could smoke weed all day.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.977
So you thought it'd be better
to include her in your family business?

08:07.320 --> 08:10.357
-What are those? _ _
-It's for the gaming C0mmISS|0n.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.817
Everything's gotta be reviewed
before they can make a recommendation.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.026
You worried?

08:15.240 --> 08:16.309
Why should I?

08:16.990 --> 08:18.070
All right.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.405
How you doing?

08:26.420 --> 08:30.129
Can I get a Corona when you get a chance?
No lime.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.966
Did you know he was coming in
this morning?

08:39.760 --> 08:40.761
No.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.641
From now on,
you're wearing a wire all the time.

08:47.230 --> 08:49.141
-What?
-Yeah.

08:49.230 --> 08:50.857
I need verbal evidence
that he's laundering

08:50.940 --> 08:52.237
so I can get a search warrant.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.529
-And have no privacy? Fuck that.
-Fuck you and your privacy.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.197
I'm coming at him from all sides.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.498
So if you're not part of the solution,
you got big fucking problems.

09:02.580 --> 09:05.037
So don't stand there
and pretend like you have any choices.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.120
What are you doing? What the hell's that?

09:15.220 --> 09:17.791
It's a bug detector.
Charlie gave it to me.

09:18.390 --> 09:19.505
[Marty] Charlie, huh?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.171
Yeah. He thinks it's the feds
that are shutting down our businesses.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.637
The feds? It could be any number
of senators or special interests.

09:25.730 --> 09:26.879
Why would he lie?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.140
Maybe because he's attracted to you, and he wants to keep
the stench off himself?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.389
Oh, please.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.187
Yeah, well, I mean, how do you know
it's not Wilkes talking to the feds?

09:35.030 --> 09:37.658
How do you know he didn't just
give you a device with a bug in it?

09:37.740 --> 09:41.153
Look, all I know is the person
who planted that bug Ruth found is still out there.
I don't think we should trust anyone.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.899
But if what he says is true,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.571
what is the endgame
of shutting down our businesses?

09:53.630 --> 09:56.542
And how did your partners
acquire their assets?

09:57.130 --> 10:02.500
A ceramic tiling business, initially.
And then they were contracted

10:02.600 --> 10:05.592
for nearly half the condominium projects
in Chicago.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.089
[Wendy] And real estate.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.398
Mm-hmm. They made a killing
near Wrigleyville.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.550
-Ugh. Cubs fans.
-[Marty] Mmm-hmm.

10:11.650 --> 10:12.765
Well, to each his own. I have to say,

10:14.730 --> 10:18.734
it doesn't look good that all of your
operations were cited on the same day.

10:20.240 --> 10:24.688
Well, I can't imagine that everyone's
happy about us opening a casino.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.996
It's not open yet.

10:27.750 --> 10:32.449
All right. A Ms. Rachel Garrison
runs the Blue Cat.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.545
As for the Lickety Splitz,
who's in charge there?

10:40.720 --> 10:43.792
Might as well get Mr. fucking Rogers
to play the boss.

10:43.890 --> 10:47.269
-You ever even been in a strip club?
-A couple times.

10:47.350 --> 10:50.558
-[scoffs] You ever tend bar?
-Well, no.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.390
[Ruth] So then, what did you do?

10:53.060 --> 10:57.019
Well, I was a real estate agent,
and now I give motivational speeches.

10:57.610 --> 11:01.273
Can you say something
to motivate me to train your ass?

11:01.360 --> 11:02.315
Um...

11:03.160 --> 11:05.572
-Oh, okay. Uh...
-I'm kidding. Please don't.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.786
So, here's the register.

11:07.870 --> 11:10.498
And we just got
a new computer system installed,

11:10.580 --> 11:13.037
so we're not stuck in the Stone Ages.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.245
Who's the cutie?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.757
-You working here now?
-I'm Sam.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.159
Jade.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.251
I'm sorry. Is it break time?

11:22.340 --> 11:25.173
Because that stage
looks fucking empty to me.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.608
You like her, don't you?

11:36.190 --> 11:37.976
-Yeah, she seems nice.
-Hmm.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.060
[inhales deeply]

11:55.670 --> 11:58.127
[humming]

12:02.840 --> 12:05.582
[strumming continues] [Russ] That chord change
always did fuck with you.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.340
[Wyatt] Just the opening.

12:15.730 --> 12:16.765
[Russ] Here.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.816
[clears throat]

12:23.950 --> 12:25.065
It was D minor...

12:26.490 --> 12:27.525
to A...

12:28.910 --> 12:29.899
to F.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.037
We passed upon the stair

12:39.250 --> 12:41.627
We spoke of was and when

12:42.970 --> 12:46.133
Although I wasn ’t there

12:47.300 --> 12:49.803
He said I was his friend

12:50.930 --> 12:53.979
Which came as some surprise

12:54.810 --> 12:57.392
I spoke into his eyes

12:57.480 --> 13:00.438
I thought you dr'ed alone

13:01.320 --> 13:04.858
A long, long t/me ago

13:07.160 --> 13:10.482
Oh, no, not me

13:10.990 --> 13:14.369
I never lost control

13:16.620 --> 13:17.700
You try.

13:26.880 --> 13:27.710
[Wyatt] Fuck, man.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.511
I really wish you were here.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.267
[Russ] Yeah, me, too.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.436
How's Three doing?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.146
[sighs] Okay.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.027
Better than me, probably.

13:45.780 --> 13:48.351
You always did kind of let shit fester.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.657
With Three, you give him a Ho Ho
and a firecracker and send him on his way.

13:52.740 --> 13:55.152
[both chuckle]

13:58.040 --> 13:59.826
I'm here now, dude. Okay?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.915
I wanted to ask you something.

14:07.130 --> 14:08.210
[Russ] Shoot.

14:11.140 --> 14:12.255
That night,

14:13.470 --> 14:16.598
when you were going to the Blue Cat
with Boyd...

14:19.440 --> 14:21.897
Were we going to hurt Charlotte's clad?

14:25.320 --> 14:26.355
No, sir.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.316
I'm not in the business of hurting people.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.906
So what happened, then?

14:35.910 --> 14:37.150
I don't know.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.491
I grabbed the thing, and...

14:40.830 --> 14:42.832
Maybe somebody was out to get us.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.086
Maybe it's like you said in your paper.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.678
We're just fucking cursed.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.307
Jesus Christ, ever heard of knocking?

15:00.810 --> 15:04.359
Just drink it.
[sighs] I had a shitty day.

15:14.410 --> 15:18.653
You really think that what happened
to Dad and Uncle Boyd was an accident?

15:23.540 --> 15:27.203
Yeah, a shitty fucking accident.

15:33.220 --> 15:34.756
I reread your essay.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.420
[sighs and scoffs]

15:36.510 --> 15:39.968
Oh, yeah? To throw out more criticisms?

15:40.480 --> 15:43.187
First of all, I don't know fuck shit

15:43.270 --> 15:47.183
about what constitutes a good essay
from a bad essay.

15:47.270 --> 15:50.683
It's your story.
Just tell it how you want.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.771
Just get some rec letters and send it.

15:54.450 --> 15:55.360
Wait.

15:59.870 --> 16:00.950
This.

16:02.370 --> 16:05.373
-[grunts] This.
-What is it?

16:06.540 --> 16:08.542
Don't need rec letters to go there.

16:09.420 --> 16:10.751
Well, no shit.

16:11.800 --> 16:12.926
What about Mizzou?

16:13.010 --> 16:14.420
Fuck Mizzou.

16:14.510 --> 16:17.752
Besides, when I went to my counselor
to get a rec, she gave me those.

16:18.180 --> 16:19.420
It's easier, I guess.

16:42.620 --> 16:43.450
[horn honks]

16:57.470 --> 16:59.506
-Hey!
-Hey.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.728
-Thanks again for accommodating Charlotte.
-Oh.

17:05.390 --> 17:06.470
You bet.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.857
So...

17:12.110 --> 17:13.646
where'd you end up going?

17:15.320 --> 17:19.108
New Orleans for a bit. Then Vegas, Keys.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.231
Wow. Back and forth.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.740
What made you come back?

17:26.330 --> 17:30.414
[Rachel]
You know why I came back.
Marty called me.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.740
Business was in trouble.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.718
Hey, look. I get that you're pissed
I took your money, okay?

17:35.800 --> 17:37.711
I was scared when that guy came.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.381
No, I'm not mad about anything.

17:40.430 --> 17:44.969
But, you know, Marty must have
called you 30 times to come back.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.635
So, why now?

17:48.230 --> 17:49.936
[Rachel]
I felt bad abandoning Tuck.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.772
[Wendy]
Oh, oh. Of course.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.317
But you didn't feel bad
about that when you left.

17:56.860 --> 17:59.408
I guess people are entitled
to a change of heart.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.613
Like, at first, I thought you
and your husband were cool.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.031
And now I think you're pieces of shit.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.917
Oh, God-fucking-damn it.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.332
[Wendy]
took, I know the feds are the ones
that are shutting us down. I know that.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.203
And it just... I don't know. It just...

18:15.300 --> 18:19.293
It feels coincidental...

18:21.010 --> 18:22.216
that you're back.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.010
Hmm.

18:27.730 --> 18:30.688
Do you want to get
into the litany of reasons

18:30.770 --> 18:33.182
why the cops might be messing with you?

18:36.400 --> 18:37.480
Charlotte!

18:41.370 --> 18:42.860
-Hi. Come on.
-[Charlotte] Bye.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.446
-See ya.
-[Rachel] Have a good one.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.495
[Wendy] Mm-hmm.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.166
[Charlotte] What was that?

18:53.040 --> 18:56.259
Rachel stole packs of money out
of the wall when she left.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.415
[Charlotte] How much?

19:00.470 --> 19:01.539
Six figures.

19:04.890 --> 19:06.676
[Charlotte] Do you want me
to keep an eye on her?

19:08.270 --> 19:09.305
Okay.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.970
[Rachel]
They are onto me.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.777
[Petty] She was fishing.
You're being paranoid.

19:17.860 --> 19:20.818
Look, I told you what he does, okay?

19:20.900 --> 19:24.028
He comes in every night
with his blue fucking mesh bag,

19:24.120 --> 19:27.908
he locks himself into the office,
and he doesn't say shit about anything.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.877
[Petty clears throat]

19:33.960 --> 19:35.837
What do you know about
the Byrdes' marriage?

19:35.920 --> 19:38.878
Not much. She had an affair.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.337
Well, that seems
like a vulnerability to me.

19:42.760 --> 19:43.715
So?

19:45.050 --> 19:46.597
So fuck him if you have to.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.511
Why? So you can listen?

19:49.430 --> 19:50.590
Is that your thing?

19:50.680 --> 19:53.979
You're some fucked up dude
who likes to listen to strangers? [Petty] Start to work Charlotte.
Be her confidant.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.891
Give her booze if you have to.
That usually works.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.575
You forgetting something?

20:24.840 --> 20:26.546
[Petty clears throat]

20:38.690 --> 20:43.059
Hey, I was just about to order a pizza
and watch the game. You hungry?

20:44.400 --> 20:45.856
[Rachel] You're a fucking dick.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.360
[Petty] Suit yourself.

20:59.540 --> 21:02.008
[woman] Well, I'm certain you'll excel
wherever you decide to go.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.579
[boy] Thanks, Miss Jacoby.

21:08.470 --> 21:12.133
Ruth. I never expected
to see you here again.

21:13.270 --> 21:15.306
I came here about Wyatt Langmore.

21:19.060 --> 21:24.350
Wyatt came to you for a rec,
and you just gave him this.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.270
Yes, I did.

21:28.660 --> 21:32.289
Look, I'm not one to tell someone how
to do their job,

21:32.830 --> 21:35.401
but it feels a little like a blow-off.

21:35.910 --> 21:38.879
I mean, it would be great
if you can write a letter for Mizzou.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.168
Well, I didn't blow him off at all.

21:42.250 --> 21:46.084
On the contrary, I was introducing Wyatt
to legitimate options.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.580
What does that mean?

21:47.680 --> 21:50.968
Well, especially since Wyatt's already
missed a number of days this year,

21:51.050 --> 21:53.268
which any university will take
into account.

21:53.350 --> 21:54.840
His dad died.

21:54.930 --> 21:57.637
What, is he supposed to miss the funeral?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.050
Look, I'm sorry. There's just been...

22:00.150 --> 22:02.562
There's been a lot going on.

22:03.690 --> 22:08.195
Could you just cut him a break this once
and write the letter?

22:09.200 --> 22:12.442
Mizzou only accepts
so many people from each school.

22:13.040 --> 22:18.615
Wyatt is better off at LOTC for two years
and, if he can handle it, transferring.

22:18.710 --> 22:21.873
Look, I get that being a puppet master
for kids' lives

22:21.960 --> 22:25.544
is doing wonders for your ego,
but put the bias aside.

22:25.630 --> 22:28.292
Wyatt isn't like the other Langmores.

22:28.380 --> 22:32.999
He's better than me, my daddy,
my daddy's daddy put together.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.887
He understands shit about the world

22:35.970 --> 22:38.473
that most people
never even have to think about.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.393
I think Wyatt has a chance for success
at LOTC.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.892
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I have another appointment.

22:43.980 --> 22:46.733
-Are you touched in the head or something?
-Excuse me?

22:47.240 --> 22:48.559
-Please leave. Now!
-[Ruth] No!

22:48.650 --> 22:50.732
I'm not leaving
without that fucking letter!

22:50.820 --> 22:53.983
It is my responsibility, MissLangmore,
to pick the winners.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.288
I'm not about to take advice from someone
who couldn't get past the tenth grade.

22:57.950 --> 22:59.156
[Jacoby gasps]

22:59.960 --> 23:03.669
[Ruth] Fuck. Fuck. Oh, fuck, fuck.

23:15.180 --> 23:18.388
[Buddy] So, you pick a spot
about 20, 30 feet away.

23:19.100 --> 23:23.309
Then you pick up the binoculars quickly
and try to hit that spot. See?

23:23.400 --> 23:26.187
-Where are you going?
-Studio 54.

23:26.270 --> 23:28.602
-What do you think?
-Just a walk, Mom.

23:28.690 --> 23:29.896
[Buddy chuckles]

23:30.700 --> 23:32.099
Do you understand what I'm saying?

23:32.740 --> 23:36.699
You take that spot, and then
you pick up the binoculars really...

23:38.870 --> 23:42.249
[Buddy groaning]

23:42.330 --> 23:43.376
[Jonah] Mom!

23:45.250 --> 23:46.205
Oh, my God.

23:49.510 --> 23:51.751
[Wyatt] I don't understand
why people tell you

23:51.840 --> 23:53.717
someone's "in a better place"
when they die.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.290
That's bullshit.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.844
People should just shake your hand
and say, "It fucking sucks." You know?

24:02.100 --> 24:04.148
What else is there to say
when someone dies, you know?

24:04.230 --> 24:05.390
It just fucking sucks.

24:08.900 --> 24:10.310
You know, I talk to him sometimes.

24:12.990 --> 24:14.867
-Your clad?
-Yeah.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.327
It's good that you talk to him.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.878
Sometimes, it's, like,
full-on conversations.

24:26.790 --> 24:30.123
It's so weird. Like, I'm so focused.
It's like he's actually there.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.507
I just can't stop thinking about...

24:36.720 --> 24:38.597
you know, if there was something I...

24:39.430 --> 24:41.978
Or anything I could have done
to help stop it.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.096
I'll never forget that night
at the Blue Cat,

24:47.860 --> 24:49.179
when the power went out.

24:51.650 --> 24:53.527
It really fucking sucks, Wyatt.

24:55.610 --> 24:56.656
Wait, you were there?

24:57.910 --> 25:00.652
Um, yeah, but I wasn't near the docks.

25:00.740 --> 25:02.571
I was with my dad, working.

25:11.380 --> 25:13.416
[heart rate monitor beeping]

25:13.510 --> 25:15.421
[breathing heavily]

25:18.890 --> 25:20.175
Stop staring.

25:21.640 --> 25:22.766
Sorry.

25:29.770 --> 25:30.976
Oh, fuck.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.770
[wheezes]

25:32.860 --> 25:36.398
You know what, Jonah?
Yeah, screw this place.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.696
I'm getting out of here.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.155
Take the bag.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.247
[panﬁng]

25:43.330 --> 25:44.319
The chair.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.536
[Marty] Well, how's Jonah?

25:46.620 --> 25:48.110
[Wendy on cellphone]
He’s okay,
all things considered.

25:48.210 --> 25:49.416
Can you get down here?

25:49.920 --> 25:51.911
I will get there as soon as I can, honey.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.456
Marty, I think you really need to be here.

25:53.550 --> 25:55.871
They say he could go at any second
Hold on.

25:55.970 --> 25:59.133
-What are you doing?
-I want to die in my bed.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.881
Get me the ftg‘k/ out of here/
- 0.
-Was that Buddy?

26:04.060 --> 26:06.301
Yeah, he's checking himself out,
apparently.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.130
It's a good thing
I didn't show up, then, huh?

26:08.230 --> 26:09.686
-[ Wendy]
lVot helpful.
-[line beeps]

26:10.230 --> 26:13.017
Honey, I'll be there as soon as I can.
I'm getting another call.

26:13.860 --> 26:15.771
Hello, Mr. Beecher. How are you?

26:15.860 --> 26:17.646
I'll make this brief, Mr. Byrde.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.277
I don't know that I'll be able
to make the recommendation for the bid.

26:21.910 --> 26:22.774
Why's that?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.155
[Beecher]
The application fee/s incomplete.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.288
If you can provide
any additional financial information,

26:28.870 --> 26:31.452
I'll be at the Golden Ridge. Goodbye.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.955
Now what?

26:36.720 --> 26:39.871
You do what you always do.
You take the bribe.

26:39.970 --> 26:42.040
Only this time,
it'll be to keep you out of jail.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.727
Hey, Wendy, so you know,

26:46.810 --> 26:51.930
Beecher said he needed more info
before he could recommend.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.396
Is that code for bribe?

26:54.480 --> 26:58.189
Yeah, I don't know,
but if it's not and we try to bribe him...

26:58.280 --> 27:00.601
Well, I'll call Charlie.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.689
How's Buddy?

27:04.700 --> 27:08.329
Stubborn as hell.
The doctor said he should not have left.

27:08.410 --> 27:10.742
He might not make it through the night.

27:11.370 --> 27:14.339
Jonah's down there with him now.
He asked him to read to him.

27:14.420 --> 27:17.207
Yeah, well, we knew this was gonna happen.

27:19.670 --> 27:20.921
Jesus, Marty.

27:22.430 --> 27:24.421
[Wendy sighs]

27:26.140 --> 27:28.927
"...and all the other stuff
she guzzled between times,

27:29.020 --> 27:29.918
what to warm herself,

27:30.020 --> 27:32.090
and what to summon up
strength and courage,

27:32.650 --> 27:34.891
but the fire of it penetrated her,

27:35.400 --> 27:38.984
it glowed down there between her legs
where women ought to glow..."

27:39.070 --> 27:40.230
[Buddy grunts]

27:40.320 --> 27:42.276
"...there was established that circuit

27:42.360 --> 27:44.942
which makes one feel the earth
under his legs again. When she lay there
with her legs apart and moaning,

27:48.330 --> 27:51.117
even if she did moan that way
for any and everybody,

27:51.210 --> 27:54.168
it was good,
it was a proper show of feeling.

27:54.830 --> 27:57.583
She didn't stare up at the ceiling
with a vacant |ook--"

27:57.670 --> 27:59.160
Jonah, what are you reading?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.791
I asked him to.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.838
Yeah, okay. It's time for bed.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.589
See you in the morning.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.446
Thanks.

28:24.030 --> 28:24.940
Well read.

28:27.160 --> 28:27.979
[Buddy chuckles]

28:29.950 --> 28:31.247
You're an asshole.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.787
What? I learned a lot from Henry Miller.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.870
Like how to get divorced?

28:37.380 --> 28:39.837
No, that was one of my regrets.

28:41.090 --> 28:45.129
And anyone who says they have no regrets
is saying, "I'm an asshole."

28:45.640 --> 28:48.757
But for the record,
literature frees the mind,

28:49.760 --> 28:55.221
but smut tethers you to the earth,
and don't you forget it.

28:55.310 --> 28:59.144
[laughing] Don't worry.
I don't think I could even if I wanted to.

28:59.230 --> 29:02.734
[Buddy coughs]

29:02.860 --> 29:03.815
You okay?

29:04.360 --> 29:07.659
[grunts] Well, no.

29:07.740 --> 29:09.321
[laughs and coughs]

29:09.410 --> 29:10.650
Don't make me laugh.

29:12.580 --> 29:13.569
[clears throat]

29:17.710 --> 29:19.120
Well, what about you?

29:21.340 --> 29:23.581
-You doing all right?
-Yeah.

29:25.970 --> 29:27.005
Yeah.

29:30.680 --> 29:33.387
"She didn't stare up at the ceiling
with a vacant look

29:33.480 --> 29:37.928
or count the bedbugs on the wallpaper.
She kept her mind on her business..."

29:38.020 --> 29:38.850
[Buddy] Mm-hmm.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.567
[indistinct chatter]

29:42.650 --> 29:45.107
They tried to make me go to rehab

29:45.200 --> 29:48.351
ButI said no, no, no

29:49.320 --> 29:52.153
Yes, I ’ve been black
But when I come back...

29:53.450 --> 29:56.908
Thank you.
The last guy played Smash Mouth.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.956
All I know,
this helps keep the bile out of my mouth.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.832
People think this song is played out,
but I say fuck 'em.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.677
You don't feel like someone who cares
too much what others think.

30:09.930 --> 30:13.923
I ’0' rather be at home with Ray

30:14.640 --> 30:15.880
Where you from?

30:17.020 --> 30:19.477
Dayton. I'm here for work.

30:21.150 --> 30:22.139
I'm John.

30:23.940 --> 30:24.895
Hi, John.

30:24.980 --> 30:27.483
I'm someone you want no part of.

30:28.530 --> 30:30.441
Come on, now I'm even more attracted.

30:31.410 --> 30:32.980
Oh, you're one of those, huh?

30:36.250 --> 30:39.208
Yes, I ’ve been black
But when I come back

30:39.290 --> 30:41.872
You 7/ know, know, know

30:43.290 --> 30:45.758
I ain ’t got the t/me

30:45.840 --> 30:48.217
- And ifmy daddy thinks I ’m fine. . .
-[Rachel panting]

30:49.430 --> 30:50.419
[knock on door]

30:50.510 --> 30:51.636
Fuck off!

30:54.720 --> 30:57.848
[chuckles] I'm falling into the sink!

30:59.100 --> 31:00.897
-[whispers] I'll call you "Marty."
-What?

31:00.980 --> 31:04.222
-[whispers] Your name is Marty.
-All right.

31:06.610 --> 31:09.647
Fuck me. Fuck, Marty.

31:09.740 --> 31:11.526
[both moaning]

31:11.610 --> 31:12.611
[Rachel] Oh, Marty.

31:14.580 --> 31:17.822
Fuck, Marty. You're so fucking good.

31:19.830 --> 31:22.458
[John grunting]

31:29.260 --> 31:35.756
This me, ”Yeah, baby, and the rest”

31:35.850 --> 31:41.379
They tried to make me go to rehab
ButI said no, no, no

31:41.850 --> 31:42.680
[John] Stupid door.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.352
Yes, I ’ve been black
But when I come back

31:45.440 --> 31:47.852
You 7/ know, know, know

31:49.650 --> 31:51.561
I don ’t ever wanna drink again. . .

31:51.650 --> 31:53.060
Did you get all that...

31:53.950 --> 31:55.406
you fuck-knob?

31:59.540 --> 32:04.660
[Petty] Yeah, sure, just hit the doorbell
and go right on without a search warrant.

32:05.170 --> 32:07.240
-[hip-hop music playing]
-Who the hell jumped my song?

32:07.880 --> 32:11.418
I did. That must have been
a hell of a shit.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.170
Were you the one knocking?

32:14.760 --> 32:17.923
It might be more sanitary
to fuck behind the dumpster out back.

32:18.430 --> 32:20.307
-Just saying.
-You know...

32:21.270 --> 32:24.091
you play badass bitch
all the fucking time.

32:24.190 --> 32:27.148
"Don't fuck with me. I'll cut you."
All that shit.

32:27.230 --> 32:30.063
-You think I'm playing?
-I think it's partly an act.

32:30.150 --> 32:31.139
Yes, I do.

32:31.650 --> 32:34.153
And I say more power to you.
Whatever works.

32:34.740 --> 32:38.858
-Well, then, you don't know shit.
-Okay. Well, I know that Tuck listens to
this rap shit all the fucking time,

32:43.160 --> 32:45.708
and you worked there, what, about a week?

32:45.790 --> 32:50.705
He thinks the sun rises for you,
so I'd say you can't be all that bad.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.678
That's 'cause Tuck is cool.

33:03.270 --> 33:04.589
You still working for Marty?

33:05.560 --> 33:08.768
[Ruth]
Managing the best fake tits
on this side of the lake.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.851
[Rachel]
You l/ke working for him?

33:12.070 --> 33:13.947
He has his moments sometimes.

33:15.070 --> 33:16.697
Yeah, I guess he's cool.

33:17.990 --> 33:19.730
But sometimes he can be...

33:21.870 --> 33:24.498
-A fucking prick?
-A fucking goddamn prick.

33:24.580 --> 33:28.414
So fucking particular
about every goddamn little thing.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.083
I bet, when he fucks, he just pulls out
a chart with the best positions and says,

33:32.170 --> 33:34.502
"These are what we need to do
for optimal success."

33:34.590 --> 33:36.376
[chuckles]

33:39.220 --> 33:43.634
"Wendy, I will predict a 30% chance

33:43.730 --> 33:46.551
that doggy style
will make you come this week."

33:46.640 --> 33:48.301
[both chuckle]

33:49.650 --> 33:52.722
-Hey, you want another round? On me.
-Sure.

33:54.780 --> 33:56.350
[Cade] What did Jesus say to the rednecks?

33:56.450 --> 33:57.348
-[Wyatt] What?
-[Three] What?

33:57.450 --> 33:59.236
[Cade] Don't do anything
till I come back.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.869
[laughs] Well, if it isn't Slappy McGee.

34:02.950 --> 34:05.077
[Three] Who you gonna hit next,
thelunchlady?

34:05.160 --> 34:07.071
-Shut up, Three.
-[|aughing]

34:07.170 --> 34:09.957
-Can I talk to you, Wyatt?
-You can talk right here.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.621
I fucked up, okay?

34:16.720 --> 34:19.507
Hey, it's cool.
Now I don't have to worry about it.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.251
[chuckles]

34:21.350 --> 34:22.419
Damn it, Wyatt. I just--

34:22.510 --> 34:25.593
[Cade] Ruthie. Him goin' to college
ain't gonna make up

34:25.680 --> 34:27.591
for all your failures at the titty bar.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.807
-What the fuck you talking about?
-I stopped by the club.

34:30.900 --> 34:34.222
They got some tweed-looking
motherfucker running things.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.857
Just the title's changed.
I'm still in charge.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.100
-[Cade] Yeah?
-Yeah.

34:38.200 --> 34:39.736
[Cade] Byrde tell you that?

34:40.740 --> 34:44.779
If he told you he shat gold bullion,
would you believe him? [laughing]

34:49.710 --> 34:50.574
[clears throat] Hey.

34:53.590 --> 34:55.660
You still hanging with blondie? [Wyatt] Yeah. You know, she...

34:59.760 --> 35:04.459
She told me that her family was
at the Blue Cat

35:04.560 --> 35:07.848
the night that my dad and Uncle Boyd died.

35:08.390 --> 35:11.439
[Cade] Yeah? If you got questions...

35:12.020 --> 35:13.647
you go get some answers.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.460
Hey, Wyatt, what's up?

35:43.550 --> 35:46.053
-Your clad here?
-For what?

35:46.140 --> 35:48.426
-[Wyatt] Is he?
-[Marty] Hey, Wyatt.

35:49.020 --> 35:51.557
Surprised to see you here.
Can I help you with something?

35:51.640 --> 35:54.643
You were, uh...
You were here the night it happened.

35:54.730 --> 35:58.063
Why wouldn't you talk to the police?
I read the report.

35:58.570 --> 35:59.525
Um...

36:00.360 --> 36:03.659
Uh, well, you know,
Rachel had it pretty much taken care of,

36:03.740 --> 36:06.652
and I wanted to get the family out of here
before they saw something, you know?

36:08.240 --> 36:09.741
So you saw the bodies?

36:12.210 --> 36:15.247
I saw the bodies, yeah.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.199
[Wyatt] What did you do with their guns?

36:20.090 --> 36:21.500
I don't know that they had any guns.

36:21.590 --> 36:23.501
-What do you mean?
-Look, were they...

36:24.890 --> 36:29.589
Did you give them a job to do
or something? Is that why they were here?

36:29.680 --> 36:31.636
Hey, I can't imagine
what you're going through,

36:31.730 --> 36:32.970
-but clearly--
-Just answer me!

36:33.060 --> 36:34.687
I don't have those answers.

36:34.770 --> 36:37.318
Um, can I talk to you
for one second real quick?

36:37.400 --> 36:40.938
Let me talk to Charlotte,
and we'll pick this back up, okay?

36:41.030 --> 36:42.520
JUSt EXCUSE US for one second.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.442
Hey, hey. What did you say?

36:47.530 --> 36:49.157
What? Nothing.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.538
Did you tell him
that we were here that night?

36:52.790 --> 36:54.917
-Yes, but it wasn't a big deal.
-Jesus.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.457
Charlotte, you can't see him anymore.
Do you understand me?

36:57.540 --> 36:58.666
Why?

36:58.750 --> 37:02.334
Why? He thinks that I killed his dad
because of something that you told him.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.968
Do you not see that as a problem?
It seems pretty clear to me.

37:05.050 --> 37:07.177
It's only a problem if you did it, right?

37:13.430 --> 37:15.648
Charlotte, do you think that I'm capable
of doing something like that?

37:17.560 --> 37:18.606
Do you?

37:20.070 --> 37:22.561
You can't physically stop me
from seeing anyone.

37:22.650 --> 37:25.653
Yes, I can. I can ship you off
to boarding school in China

37:25.740 --> 37:28.812
if that's what it takes.
Don't test me on that.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.071
Why the fuck did we come back?

37:34.710 --> 37:35.529
[knock on door]

37:37.120 --> 37:38.246
He's dirty.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.877
-At what price?
-50K.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.336
[Wendy scoffs]

37:43.300 --> 37:44.460
-Come in.
-Yeah.

37:44.550 --> 37:47.178
-Want a cup of coffee?
-I'd love one. Thanks.

37:50.550 --> 37:53.212
Oh, but it's not the money
that's the key to his heart.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.517
Or his recommendation, I should say.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.058
[chuckles] I'm almost afraid
to ask what it is.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.486
"Dead &amp; Company"?

38:05.570 --> 38:08.061
Mm-hmm. Members of the Grateful Dead.

38:08.570 --> 38:11.869
They have four shows upcoming
in Missouri and Nebraska. [chuckles]

38:11.950 --> 38:15.989
You are kidding me.
Tweedledum is a Deadhead.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.490
-Mmm-hmm.
-[Wendy laughs]

38:17.580 --> 38:20.834
Last four bribes he took
all included backstage passes.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.165
What were you and Marty gonna offer?

38:23.750 --> 38:27.538
-I wanted to talk to you about that first.
-Real|y? I'm flattered.

38:28.130 --> 38:31.133
Now, after he pockets them,
just leave the briefcase behind. Walk out.

38:31.220 --> 38:34.053
The passes are simply so he knows
you're there to play ball.

38:34.140 --> 38:37.132
Hmm. Kinda like visiting you
at the lake house.

38:37.230 --> 38:40.347
Yeah. Only difference is
I never told anyone that myself.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.398
Others do it for me,
so I'm not on the front lines.

38:43.900 --> 38:48.519
For you, who should be out running
gubernatorial campaigns, you're exposed.

38:51.570 --> 38:52.776
[Charlotte] Hey, Wyatt.

38:55.370 --> 38:59.989
I know you were pretty upset earlier.
I just wanted to talk to you about stuff.

39:02.750 --> 39:05.127
Call me back. Okay, bye.

39:06.420 --> 39:07.796
[Rachel] Hey, Charlotte.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.751
[sighs]
I know you got a lot of shit going on.

39:13.510 --> 39:16.559
And I just wanted to say
you can talk to me if you wanted to.

39:18.140 --> 39:19.095
Want a sip?

39:22.190 --> 39:23.976
Don't tell your dad. [chuckles]

39:26.360 --> 39:28.931
You know, I dated this guy in high school.

39:29.780 --> 39:31.486
My grandma forbid it.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.028
-So, naturally, I saw him more.
-I know you stole from us.

39:36.790 --> 39:37.688
[Rachel]
I ’m sorry.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.826
I took it ’cause of everything going on.

39:41.790 --> 39:44.122
I was scared _ _
about what your dad was Involved In.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.997
I don't care.
And I'm not talking to you about shit.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.881
[typing] I'm helping by being here.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.689
[Marty sighs]

40:13.240 --> 40:14.559
Yeah, I know.

40:15.410 --> 40:17.275
Want to tell that to your family?

40:18.160 --> 40:19.491
What are you talking about?

40:20.370 --> 40:22.998
Charlotte just basically told me
to get bent.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.339
Wendy came in here in interrogation mode
'cause the cops are in your shit.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.251
t/ke I might know anything about that.

40:29.340 --> 40:32.503
Like you guys didn't hijack my business
and almost get me killed.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.927
Well, you love to play the victim card,
don't you?

40:36.010 --> 40:37.136
Sorry, "the victim card"?

40:37.220 --> 40:39.927
Yeah, just a constant "woe is me."
It's the same old song, Rachel.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.305
Because I don't like your harpy wife

40:41.390 --> 40:44.223
and your fucking entitled daughter
treating me like I'm the enemy?

40:44.310 --> 40:48.428
Well, maybe they should be suspicious.
I mean, tell me. Why should we trust you?

40:48.520 --> 40:50.067
Are you fucking serious?

40:50.570 --> 40:51.889
After the businesses
were shut down,

40:51.990 --> 40:54.527
the only thing that changed
is you were back in the loop.

40:55.030 --> 40:57.521
-You remember who called who, right?
-Yeah, sure, I do.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.486
But can you honestly say
that your past actions

41:00.580 --> 41:03.208
give you any credibility
at all whatsoever?

41:03.290 --> 41:05.702
-Can yours?
-I'm not in question here.

41:05.790 --> 41:08.418
Right, because it is clear how fucked
your moral compass is.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.541
You think I ’m a rat.

41:14.010 --> 41:15.125
Are you?

41:18.050 --> 41:19.039
[exhales]

41:20.350 --> 41:24.468
You are a fucking first-class prick.
You know that?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.056
You're worried about me?

41:28.360 --> 41:31.648
You got Russ Langmore's fucking friend
hanging out,

41:31.730 --> 41:35.234
watching everything you're doing,
and you're worried about me?

41:35.320 --> 41:38.448
-What are you talking about?
-The guy, he's tall, brown hair.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.112
He was just sitting here yesterday
when you were getting your books.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.661
I didn't know that he knew Russ.
What are you talking about?

41:46.750 --> 41:48.456
Well, he was here the day after Russ died,

41:48.540 --> 41:50.087
and he was asking
a whole heap of questions.

41:50.670 --> 41:52.501
And then that Mexican guy, he was here.

41:52.590 --> 41:55.502
[stammering] And then this guy
was just fucking sitting in his car,

41:55.590 --> 41:57.217
chilling and watching
the whole fucking thing.

41:57.300 --> 41:58.540
And you're worried about me?

41:58.640 --> 42:00.790
You ’re trying to figure out
who the thin blue line is,

42:00.890 --> 42:02.801
and you ’re not th/nk/ng
about that fucking asshole?

42:05.100 --> 42:06.977
How come you never said
anything about this before?

42:07.060 --> 42:08.436
Because I left, Marty.

42:09.100 --> 42:12.069
Because I don't want to be dealing
with any of your fucking bullshit.

42:12.610 --> 42:16.819
I'm here to protect Tuck, and that is it.
I just want you out of my fucking hair.

42:30.420 --> 42:31.489
Shit.

42:32.290 --> 42:33.496
Shit!

42:34.090 --> 42:35.079
Fuck.

42:47.520 --> 42:48.839
[exhales]

42:59.110 --> 43:01.112
[Mason] Give your blood money
to somebody else.

43:04.450 --> 43:07.078
-Mason?
-There it is. Take it.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.787
I don't know what this is.

43:08.870 --> 43:11.668
Have you ever in your life
told the truth?

43:12.500 --> 43:16.288
I got a message saying someone started
a fund-raising page for me.

43:16.800 --> 43:19.291
And nobody in my congregation did it.
So who else does that leave?

43:19.380 --> 43:23.384
It wasn't me. But whoever did it,
this can help you, right?

43:23.470 --> 43:26.519
Are you deaf? I don't want it.

43:31.600 --> 43:35.639
-Ah, what about your son?
-Oh, my son is none of your business.

43:35.730 --> 43:38.142
-You got a lot of nerve bringing him up.
-Take it easy.

43:38.570 --> 43:40.811
Is this supposed
to resurrect his mom?

43:41.450 --> 43:43.156
No, but it can feed him.

43:43.740 --> 43:47.449
We'd rather die in the gutter
than live off of this money.

43:50.460 --> 43:53.827
The wage of sin is death. Remember that.

44:13.440 --> 44:17.149
And he decided heroin was more important
than our kids.

44:18.150 --> 44:19.981
-So...
-Jeez.

44:20.490 --> 44:23.903
Well, anybody who leaves you hanging
like that sounds like a real loser.

44:26.370 --> 44:31.535
Hey, um, if you're not working one night,
maybe I could take you out to dinner?

44:33.420 --> 44:36.207
And your kids. Or just you.

44:36.290 --> 44:38.417
[Cade] You gotta work
a little harder than that.

44:38.500 --> 44:39.580
[Sam] All right, I'll be right back.

44:39.670 --> 44:41.080
-[Cade] There it is.
-[Raven] Don't touch me.

44:41.170 --> 44:43.582
-[Cade] Look at that...
-[Raven] Pay me right now!

44:43.680 --> 44:45.295
[Cade] Then do something good.

44:45.390 --> 44:47.381
-Come here--
-He owes me 30 bucks.

44:47.470 --> 44:51.099
For that dead fish impersonation?
My pillow is far more arousing.

44:51.180 --> 44:53.341
Okay. Mr. Langmore, what's the problem?

44:53.440 --> 44:57.649
The problem is you need to eat a dick
and get the fuck out of my face.

44:59.440 --> 45:00.725
Now, where were we, honey?

45:01.320 --> 45:02.639
-No, don't touch me.
-[Cade chuckles]

45:05.110 --> 45:07.567
Hey, Ruth,
your dad's causing trouble.

45:07.660 --> 45:10.481
So? People think you're in charge.
Deal with it.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.155
[Sam sighs]

45:15.750 --> 45:17.957
-[Cade] Just do that twirly thing.
-[Raven] You know what? Just--

45:18.040 --> 45:22.204
Okay, I understand
you weren't satisfied with your dance.

45:23.340 --> 45:25.717
But I think we can both agree

45:25.800 --> 45:28.678
that sometimes our expectation
exceeds reality.

45:28.760 --> 45:29.590
[Raven] Fuck that!

45:29.680 --> 45:32.558
[Sam] So, when you look at it like that,
understanding that it's not personal,

45:33.430 --> 45:35.728
the anger can dissipate, and you can see

45:35.810 --> 45:38.358
that she deserves her money
for services rendered.

45:38.440 --> 45:40.852
That's mighty persuasive, I must say.

45:40.940 --> 45:44.649
But I think I'm gonna take a page
from my baby girl on this one.

45:44.740 --> 45:45.809
[Sam grunts]

45:45.900 --> 45:47.982
[Cade laughs]

45:48.070 --> 45:49.867
Okay, Dad, you gotta pay her and go.

45:49.950 --> 45:52.748
Yeah right. Look at him.
He's fine. It was funny. [laughing]

45:52.830 --> 45:54.070
No, I'm not joking.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.076
You don't think I'm in charge here?

45:59.170 --> 46:00.034
Mike!

46:01.800 --> 46:03.665
Make sure he finds his way out.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.910
[Cade] Back the fuck off, Mike. I'm going.

46:10.550 --> 46:11.505
Fuck off me.

46:12.100 --> 46:13.169
Thanks.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.636
You always have to cause some shit, huh?

46:16.730 --> 46:17.970
Do it somewhere else.

46:18.060 --> 46:19.937
I'm taking you off the fucking schedule.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.811
Get the fuck up.

46:31.910 --> 46:33.070
[tires screech]

46:33.200 --> 46:34.280
[Petty] Get in.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.747
Get in!

46:59.230 --> 47:00.219
[Petty] Hurry up.

47:03.270 --> 47:06.854
[Rachel] No. No, I'm not going.
Look, you gotta understand.

47:07.440 --> 47:11.524
-Please. Please. Oh, my gosh.
-[Petty] Start walking. Now!

47:12.740 --> 47:14.321
[Rachel] You don't understand.
Please don't.

47:14.410 --> 47:15.616
They thought I was a rat.

47:15.700 --> 47:18.658
If they knew for sure, I would be dead.
You know that that's true.

47:18.750 --> 47:20.206
You know that that's true. Please.

47:20.290 --> 47:24.283
-Please. I just wanted them to trust me.
-[Petty] Get the fuck up.

47:24.380 --> 47:26.291
[Rachel] Please. Please.

47:28.380 --> 47:31.634
-[grunts]
-I have been working this fucking case

47:31.720 --> 47:34.097
-for two years undercover.
-Please.

47:34.180 --> 47:37.058
-Two years of my life, you fucking CI!
-Please don't.

47:37.140 --> 47:39.552
-It's all blown now.
-He's gonna trust me now.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.642
I swear to God he's gonna trust me now!

47:41.730 --> 47:43.686
I have a target
on my back now, Rachel.

47:43.770 --> 47:47.558
I will get you something.
I will get you something. I swear to God.

47:47.650 --> 47:50.062
Oh, my God, please! Oh, my God, please!

47:50.150 --> 47:51.481
-I swear to God.
-[gun cocks]

47:52.070 --> 47:54.061
[sobbing] I swear to God, please.

47:58.870 --> 47:59.859
[sniffs]

48:01.710 --> 48:03.075
Goodbye, Rachel.

48:03.170 --> 48:06.242
[sobbing] Please. Please.

48:06.840 --> 48:07.738
[gun clicks]

48:10.590 --> 48:13.081
Next time,
there'll be a hole here waiting for you.

48:13.180 --> 48:15.171
[panﬁng]

48:26.320 --> 48:28.185
[sobs]

48:37.030 --> 48:38.657
-What's that?
-That's from Mason.

48:38.740 --> 48:41.743
While you were saying goodbye to Wilkes,
he threw that at me in the driveway.

48:41.830 --> 48:42.865
Oh, God.

48:43.370 --> 48:45.372
Why didn't you tell me
you were giving him money?

48:46.210 --> 48:48.041
Because you wouldn't have approved.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.120
Really?
You think I'm just heartless?

48:50.210 --> 48:52.417
No, no. But you can
put the blinders on sometimes.

48:52.510 --> 48:55.081
-You know that's true.
-I know that's true? That's not true.

48:55.180 --> 48:56.636
Have you been down to see Buddy? What did Wilkes want?

48:59.390 --> 49:02.553
-Wanted to talk about Beecher.
-Were you gonna tell me?

49:02.640 --> 49:04.938
It wasn't a secret.
Is that what this is about?

49:05.020 --> 49:07.762
It's about you
making unilateral decisions, Wendy.

49:07.860 --> 49:10.021
Well, that's a broad generalization.

49:10.530 --> 49:13.647
-What else, other than Mason?
-What about you questioning Rachel?

49:13.740 --> 49:14.650
I don't trust her.

49:14.740 --> 49:18.483
-And then you turned Charlotte into a spy?
-I asked her to keep an eye on things.

49:18.580 --> 49:19.695
Why do you trust Rachel?

49:19.790 --> 49:21.109
I don't think it's smart to alienate

49:21.200 --> 49:23.612
one of the very few people
that are helping us with this.

49:23.710 --> 49:26.281
-And plus, we screwed her over.
-Oh, please, we've screwed over everybody.

49:26.380 --> 49:27.278
Stop!

49:30.130 --> 49:32.451
-Why are you arguing?
-We're not, honey. We're not.

49:32.550 --> 49:33.369
[Marty] Everything's fine.

49:33.970 --> 49:34.834
We're okay.

49:35.630 --> 49:38.383
-Good night.
-Well, it's not good for Buddy.

49:47.020 --> 49:48.510
-I had a--
-[door closes]

49:48.610 --> 49:51.568
-I had a stressful day.
-So did I.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.020
Uh...

49:53.650 --> 49:56.403
Charlotte told Wyatt
that we were at the Blue Cat

49:56.490 --> 49:58.117
when the Langmores died.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.191
So I told Charlotte
she can't see Wyatt anymore.

50:00.780 --> 50:02.998
All right? So, there's that, too.

50:04.660 --> 50:06.116
I'll talk to her.

50:09.670 --> 50:10.739
Good night.

50:16.220 --> 50:20.133
I've heard they have a great spa here.
How long are you staying?

50:20.220 --> 50:22.256
Oh, just a couple days.

50:22.350 --> 50:24.261
[Marty] Wendy and I
heard through the grapevine

50:24.350 --> 50:26.557
that you are a Grateful Dead aficionado,

50:26.640 --> 50:27.880
and we are, as well.

50:27.980 --> 50:31.268
We've got a couple of tickets
to their upcoming show,

50:31.360 --> 50:33.476
with two backstage passes,

50:34.070 --> 50:36.026
and unfortunately, we can't use them.

50:36.110 --> 50:40.524
And we were wondering if you can.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.116
Would you like to go to that?

50:51.080 --> 50:52.377
Oh, yeah, sure.

50:54.550 --> 50:58.338
Dynamite. That's great. Great. Um...

50:58.930 --> 51:04.129
Let us comb through our records,
and we will get right back to you.

51:07.600 --> 51:10.182
-[Marty] Uh, Wendy?
-So nice seeing you, Mr. Beecher.

51:10.270 --> 51:12.056
-Thank you so much.
-[Marty] Honey. Honey.

51:18.650 --> 51:22.029
Gotta go. You enjoy that.

51:32.880 --> 51:33.949
[Marty] What was that?

51:35.050 --> 51:36.950
I had a bad feeling.

51:37.050 --> 51:38.165
[Marty] "A bad feeling"?

51:38.920 --> 51:40.831
That room, it was too clean.

51:40.930 --> 51:43.137
It was immaculate.
There was no luggage anywhere.

51:43.220 --> 51:45.632
-He was acting very nervous.
-The room was too clean?

51:45.720 --> 51:48.052
Maybe the guy's luggage was in the closet.

51:48.140 --> 51:51.724
Did you ever think about that?
And so he's not Mr. Gregarious.

51:52.230 --> 51:55.108
Didn't Wilkes tell you this guy's
taken bribes, like, multiple times?

51:55.190 --> 51:57.431
-Yes.
-Okay. Why is today different?

51:57.530 --> 52:00.067
I know you think
I made a unilateral decision here.

52:00.150 --> 52:02.812
But with everything going on,
I'm not willing to take the chance.

52:06.370 --> 52:09.362
Well, I hope you're right, Wendy, because
without his recommendation, we're fucked.

52:11.790 --> 52:13.371
You starting a trend?

52:16.290 --> 52:20.408
So, what's the word? Other than the end
to another shitty fucking week.

52:21.340 --> 52:23.922
[Ruth]
Kinda getting sick of it;
to be honest.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.169
[Rachel]
Can I try my luck?

52:28.100 --> 52:29.306
[metal clanking]

52:29.390 --> 52:32.518
Fucking hell. This fucking cunt.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.433
So, how'd you get involved with Byrde
in the first place?

52:37.400 --> 52:42.940
Easy. I just stole some of his cash,
and he wanted me to keep quiet.

52:44.530 --> 52:46.657
Who knew we had so much in common?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.400
I wonder if it's the same cash he hid
in my wall.

52:55.040 --> 52:56.325
At the Blue Cat?

52:57.540 --> 52:59.167
It's gone, though, now.

53:01.010 --> 53:05.219
[Ruth]
Has he ever tried to fuck you
with his overt-act shit?

53:05.800 --> 53:07.131
[Rachel] Yep. Fucker.

53:07.220 --> 53:09.176
Does he roll in
with that lame blue mesh bag,

53:09.260 --> 53:12.138
lock himself in the office like
he's working out or some shit?

53:12.230 --> 53:17.008
[Ruth]
No, not unless he ’s benching
a flash drive and a bulk of cash,

53:17.110 --> 53:20.102
lrke a cat burg/ar’s ut/lity bag.

53:20.190 --> 53:22.351
-[Petty] There you go.
-[Ruth]
Home to office, office to home.

53:22.440 --> 53:24.101
There you fucking go.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.599
There you fucking go!

53:25.700 --> 53:28.112
[Rachel]
We ’re his little worker bees
wh/le his ass gets rich.

53:32.450 --> 53:34.031
You're terrible at this.

53:35.210 --> 53:36.359
Yeah.

54:06.950 --> 54:08.065
[Marty] Buddy. [whispers] Buddy.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.801
Boo.

54:34.270 --> 54:35.385
That's not funny.

54:35.480 --> 54:36.765
[Buddy chuckles]

54:37.600 --> 54:39.340
[coughs]

54:41.520 --> 54:43.977
[breathing heavily]

54:44.820 --> 54:48.028
You're kind of a dick. You know that?

54:48.110 --> 54:49.156
I love you, too.

54:50.990 --> 54:53.026
[Buddy grunts]

54:54.240 --> 54:55.116
[exhales]

54:55.870 --> 54:57.155
May I help?

55:01.540 --> 55:05.124
Sit down. [exhales]

55:06.090 --> 55:08.672
I understand why you didn't come down.

55:10.760 --> 55:11.715
Yeah?

55:12.760 --> 55:14.842
Everyone handles it differently.

55:20.350 --> 55:22.602
Well, Jonah says you're gonna live,
so... -You know, well, I figured...
-[chuckles]

55:26.940 --> 55:30.023
You know, he gets that from me.
I did the same thing when my dad died.

55:31.950 --> 55:33.611
It was pancreatitis, too.

55:37.290 --> 55:42.205
We weren't even that close. _ _
I knew the percentages of pancreatitis.

55:43.290 --> 55:44.336
Stop.

55:44.960 --> 55:45.870
[Marty] Hmm?

55:46.340 --> 55:49.468
Analyzing. You're exhausting.

55:50.430 --> 55:51.465
Sorry.

55:52.800 --> 55:56.304
[sighs] It is what it is.

55:58.350 --> 56:03.299
It's like watching
the Detroit Lions sucking.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.487
My fucking beard...

56:11.490 --> 56:12.650
it itches.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.576
[Marty] It's gonna feel better.

56:45.770 --> 56:46.930
[Buddy grunts]

56:49.570 --> 56:52.107
Shit. Sorry.

56:56.120 --> 56:57.109
It's fine. Maybe, uh...

57:04.870 --> 57:06.417
Leave the mustache.

57:07.380 --> 57:08.540
[Marty] Good idea.

57:32.440 --> 57:34.271
[alarm blaring]

57:35.780 --> 57:38.692
[man] FBI! We have a search warrant!
Coming in!

58:36.260 --> 58:37.500
Good morning.
