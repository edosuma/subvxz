WEBVTT

01:37.511 --> 01:38.615
I'm going in.

02:27.077 --> 02:29.770
Oh!

04:09.594 --> 04:11.009
<i>There is</i>

04:11.009 --> 04:13.529
<i>an impossibly fine line</i>

04:13.529 --> 04:16.152
<i>between sanity and madness.</i>

04:16.152 --> 04:18.430
<i>And it's not always
possible to know</i>

04:18.430 --> 04:21.261
which side
of that line we
are standing on.

04:22.089 --> 04:24.781
The violence
between disparate sides

04:24.781 --> 04:27.232
is not endemic
to this culture.

04:27.232 --> 04:30.131
it is endemic
to all cultures.

04:32.099 --> 04:33.445
We are again

04:33.445 --> 04:34.722
tribes.

04:35.654 --> 04:37.863
But defining

04:37.863 --> 04:39.934
our tribe
is not as simple

04:39.934 --> 04:41.902
as the black people
born under the sun,

04:41.902 --> 04:43.731
or the white people
born under the moon.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.597
Our division is,

04:47.597 --> 04:48.702
wrong others

04:49.219 --> 04:52.292
against right self.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.708
And this division
does not rest

04:54.708 --> 04:57.676
simply on
an unfamiliarity

04:57.676 --> 04:59.747
with a tribe
other than our own.

04:59.747 --> 05:01.197
It's deeper
than that.

05:01.197 --> 05:02.232
Sir?

05:02.612 --> 05:03.648
Yes?

05:04.649 --> 05:06.996
It's the 21st century,
Dr. Mackles.

05:06.996 --> 05:08.480
With my phone,
I can learn about

05:08.480 --> 05:10.068
any culture
on the planet.

05:10.068 --> 05:11.794
I'm a Google search away
from knowing

05:11.794 --> 05:13.865
everything about
a belief system
in 20 minutes.

05:15.073 --> 05:16.557
Let me ask you a question.

05:18.835 --> 05:21.493
What if that
belief system
you Googled

05:21.493 --> 05:24.289
was so antithetical
to your own,

05:24.289 --> 05:27.568
that would seem,
for lack of a better word,

05:27.568 --> 05:28.845
insane?

05:29.915 --> 05:31.400
Like what?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.194
Well, like, uh,

05:33.194 --> 05:34.230
take medicine.

05:35.990 --> 05:39.166
Here,
medicine is

05:39.166 --> 05:41.858
all pharmaceutical compounds

05:41.858 --> 05:43.619
created
in laboratories,

05:43.619 --> 05:47.001
sold by faceless corporations
to millions.

05:48.244 --> 05:50.073
In other parts
of the world,

05:50.833 --> 05:53.491
medicine
is a plant.

05:55.976 --> 05:57.736
A bit of bark,
a root,

05:58.634 --> 05:59.600
or a mineral.

06:00.705 --> 06:03.121
Or a combination
of all of them.

06:03.121 --> 06:04.605
Administered
to one man

06:05.572 --> 06:07.159
by another man

06:08.091 --> 06:11.440
who is believed
to channel powers

06:11.440 --> 06:15.064
that you could not
begin to comprehend.

06:17.273 --> 06:20.345
This medical knowledge
is based on ancient beliefs.

06:21.450 --> 06:23.866
The tenets of which
in this country,

06:23.866 --> 06:25.454
it would just make
your blood run cold.

06:27.490 --> 06:31.874
Metaphysical
beliefs in healing
and humanity.

06:32.599 --> 06:34.083
That would seem, um,

06:34.083 --> 06:35.498
insane to you,

06:35.498 --> 06:38.363
no matter how hard
you tried to understand them.

06:38.363 --> 06:40.917
But it is
the very belief
in such things

06:40.917 --> 06:42.540
that gives
this medicine
it's power.

06:43.886 --> 06:45.163
Looks like we're
out of time.

06:46.129 --> 06:48.373
So, we'll take this
up again
next week.

06:51.376 --> 06:52.377
Thank you.

06:57.762 --> 06:58.832
Mr. Hobbs.

07:00.350 --> 07:02.111
I want you
to do something
for me.

07:03.388 --> 07:04.907
A little extra credit,
if you will.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.289
I want you to take
that phone
in your pocket

07:08.289 --> 07:11.983
and find me
a culture that is so
inverse to your own

07:11.983 --> 07:14.986
that the idea
of it taking root
here, in this city,

07:14.986 --> 07:17.057
would scare
the bejesus
out of you.

07:17.954 --> 07:18.955
Yes, sir.

07:51.988 --> 07:52.955
Get the fuck
in there!

07:53.990 --> 07:55.129
Don't fucking move.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.236
No! Wait!

07:58.236 --> 07:59.409
- Hey!
Stop!

07:59.409 --> 08:00.480
What are you doing
in there?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.550
I'm Detective Boyd.

08:01.550 --> 08:02.620
Get away from me!

08:02.620 --> 08:04.276
- Calm down, it's okay.
I don't wanna go.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.381
Please?

08:05.381 --> 08:07.245
No. What's he
doing with her?
That's mine!

08:07.245 --> 08:08.833
Shut the fuck up!

08:08.833 --> 08:10.213
You can't take her!

08:10.213 --> 08:11.352
I'm Detective Boyd.

08:11.352 --> 08:13.044
- She's mine!
Don't talk to her!

08:15.011 --> 08:16.150
Come on, give me you hand.

08:16.150 --> 08:17.289
What are you
doing with her?

08:18.325 --> 08:19.360
Keep your hands up!

08:22.502 --> 08:24.158
Look, I'm gonna get you
outta here. Come on.

08:24.158 --> 08:25.401
- Maria?
- Hey, where are you going?

08:25.401 --> 08:26.782
- Maria?
- Where you going?

08:27.368 --> 08:28.369
You can't take her!

08:30.510 --> 08:31.545
Hey, man.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.615
Get on your fucking--She stays with me, pal.

08:32.615 --> 08:33.892
Get down on your feet now.

08:33.892 --> 08:35.687
I didn't do
anything wrong, man.

08:35.687 --> 08:37.620
- Yeah?
- She came willingly
with me.

08:37.620 --> 08:39.139
I told you, get on
your fucking feet!

08:39.139 --> 08:40.520
Nah! You go
to hell, bitch.

08:41.728 --> 08:43.108
You first.

09:36.955 --> 09:38.957
No, no, no, no!

09:44.584 --> 09:45.585
We need him alive!

11:32.553 --> 11:33.727
Medics are on the way.

13:04.473 --> 13:05.957
Then go to hell!

13:05.957 --> 13:07.476
You first.

13:39.197 --> 13:40.958
Mr. Farner.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.718
Mr. Randoku.
It is an honor, sir.

13:44.133 --> 13:47.240
A man like you,
who is so powerful.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.726
Tell me, why do you
want to do this?

13:51.313 --> 13:52.521
Who is interviewing who?

13:52.521 --> 13:53.729
I am interviewing
you, sir.

13:54.523 --> 13:57.664
I do not do business
with anyone,

13:57.664 --> 13:59.804
I do not know
everything about.

13:59.804 --> 14:02.186
Neither do I.

14:02.186 --> 14:04.291
Mr. Randoku,
I'm a man who
explores options

14:05.189 --> 14:06.328
of power,
as you say.

14:06.742 --> 14:08.571
It is elusive.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.263
You are a man
who harvests power,

14:10.815 --> 14:12.472
and bottles it even.

14:12.472 --> 14:15.924
You're also a man
with a lot of eyes
on you right now.

14:15.924 --> 14:17.684
I have a plane
that can take you
anywhere you like.

14:23.552 --> 14:25.071
Appreciate
the kind words, sir.

14:26.072 --> 14:27.556
I do not
need your help.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.110
You... need me.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.738
Let me know
when you are ready.

14:45.091 --> 14:47.714
Think of the souls
you could've harvested
there, Mr. Randoku.

14:53.996 --> 14:56.930
Detective Boyd,
did you feel
any sense of vindication

14:56.930 --> 14:58.276
when you fired
at the suspect?

14:59.450 --> 15:01.417
Other than it was
him or me? No.

15:03.109 --> 15:05.835
Did the death of your
own daughter in any way

15:05.835 --> 15:08.148
affect your decision
to fire on Mr. Preston?

15:09.011 --> 15:10.185
No.

15:11.807 --> 15:13.913
Let's be honest, Ms. Cannon.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.260
Mr. Preston was clearly
leaning forward

15:16.260 --> 15:17.468
at the time
of the shooting,

15:17.468 --> 15:18.952
reaching for a gun.

15:20.609 --> 15:21.679
Any more questions?

15:37.522 --> 15:38.489
<i>You okay?</i>

15:42.079 --> 15:43.080
Yeah.

15:46.048 --> 15:47.739
That's not convincing.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.950
No, I'm okay.

15:56.265 --> 15:57.818
I had another bad dream.

16:00.511 --> 16:01.581
Do you want
to talk about it?

16:04.653 --> 16:05.792
No. Not really.

17:46.686 --> 17:48.239
<i>Hello?</i>

17:48.239 --> 17:49.275
Yes, it' s me.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.174
Let's move forward.

17:54.142 --> 17:55.798
I'll wire
what we agreed upon.

18:58.344 --> 19:00.311
Go, go, go, go, go!

19:10.942 --> 19:12.806
You got it!

19:43.561 --> 19:45.667
All right,
you go first.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.220
I'm just kidding. Yeah.

19:48.152 --> 19:49.429
What's going on?

19:50.603 --> 19:53.640
You might have fooled
the review board,

19:53.640 --> 19:55.194
but don't you think
you can fool me.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.264
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:56.264 --> 19:57.955
Now, you get your ass

19:57.955 --> 20:01.027
over to the shrink
and see if you can fool her.

20:01.027 --> 20:02.580
I think I'm having
a hard time hearing you

20:02.580 --> 20:04.203
'cause all I can hear
are the voices.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
You know?

20:07.136 --> 20:08.207
Fuckers... You having fun?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.208
Yeah, loads.

20:24.913 --> 20:26.777
<i>I was thinking maybe
you should take a vacation.</i>

20:26.777 --> 20:27.881
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:27.881 --> 20:29.780
I'm just curious.
Where would you send me?

20:29.780 --> 20:31.022
Anywhere but here.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.093
And do what?

20:33.093 --> 20:35.095
I don't know. Fish.

20:35.095 --> 20:36.856
Go out on
- a charter boat.
- Fish?

20:36.856 --> 20:38.927
Drop a line
in the water.

20:38.927 --> 20:40.239
Maria, that sounds
fucking horrible.

20:41.930 --> 20:42.965
Well, you need it.

20:48.350 --> 20:50.525
Between you and I
- and just us.
- Yeah?

20:50.525 --> 20:51.871
Was he really
going for his gun?

20:54.080 --> 20:56.255
Maria, let me ask
you a question.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.980
Do you think anybody
misses Ted Bundy?

20:57.980 --> 20:59.430
That's not an answer.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.605
No. It is,
if you're listening.

21:01.605 --> 21:03.434
Fuck that.

21:03.434 --> 21:04.884
You want me to get that?

21:04.884 --> 21:06.817
- Yeah, you get that.
- This is 130 reporting.

21:19.485 --> 21:21.590
What do we got, Jimmy?

21:21.590 --> 21:24.248
A floater.
Caucasian female.

21:24.248 --> 21:26.146
She's been dead,
maybe 6 hours.

21:30.392 --> 21:31.393
Oh, fuck.

21:32.739 --> 21:33.775
Any ID?

21:33.775 --> 21:34.948
No. Nothing.

21:34.948 --> 21:36.778
Age?

21:36.778 --> 21:38.297
Maybe 14, 15.

21:42.231 --> 21:43.854
Somebody did
a real number on her.

21:45.269 --> 21:48.307
Her hands, genitals
have been removed.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.756
You mean,
crabs got to her?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.484
You don't lose the parts
she's missing to wildlife.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.694
She was cut
before she was dumped.

22:06.808 --> 22:09.638
If it wasn't a scalpel,
it was something
just as sharp.

22:10.777 --> 22:13.021
Eyes, eyelids.

22:13.021 --> 22:14.194
Yeah.

22:14.194 --> 22:16.231
Left hand, missing.

22:16.714 --> 22:17.853
Gone.

22:18.751 --> 22:20.269
You think that's what
killed her, Bill?

22:21.201 --> 22:23.169
No. Death was
a courtesy of this.

22:23.894 --> 22:27.138
Throat cut. Bled out.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.968
Her veins are
full of river silt.

22:30.038 --> 22:32.627
The only DNA we found
was that of hers.

22:33.766 --> 22:35.181
And these marks.

22:35.802 --> 22:37.666
Look at these.

22:37.666 --> 22:39.219
It's like
some kind of rope.

22:40.082 --> 22:41.256
Hung by her feet.

22:41.808 --> 22:43.016
Like a side of beef.

22:45.225 --> 22:46.330
Goddamn.

22:51.646 --> 22:53.510
This isn't
getting any better.

22:53.510 --> 22:56.133
I'll know more later.
All right.

22:56.133 --> 22:58.342
Thanks, doc.
Can you send it
upstairs for me?

22:58.342 --> 22:59.930
Yeah.
Thank you.

23:01.897 --> 23:03.451
- You okay?
- Hmm?

23:03.451 --> 23:05.142
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

23:07.938 --> 23:08.904
Just give me a second.

23:38.762 --> 23:41.247
All right, gang related or...

23:41.247 --> 23:43.180
No, no, no, no.
This ain't gang related.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.284
No?

23:44.284 --> 23:46.045
It's more methodical.
Somebody with a purpose.

23:46.045 --> 23:48.599
Yeah. With a purpose, right?

23:48.599 --> 23:50.463
Come on, Boyd.
You don't know that yet.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.914
What if he's right?

23:52.914 --> 23:54.985
About what?

23:54.985 --> 23:57.470
You have other cases
with so much better leads.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.024
Now just do your job.
Get the hell out of here.

24:00.024 --> 24:01.612
Captain?
- Yeah?

24:01.612 --> 24:03.442
You didn't see
what she looked like.

24:09.378 --> 24:10.828
What are you thinking?

24:10.828 --> 24:13.866
I'm thinking
another good cop
became a bureaucrat.

24:13.866 --> 24:15.523
Well, how about
I buy you a drink?

24:15.523 --> 24:16.662
Sounds great.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.940
Ooh!

24:19.975 --> 24:21.287
Yo! That's a brick!

24:21.287 --> 24:23.289
Oh, come on, dude!
Hit me! I'm open! I'm open!

24:23.289 --> 24:24.359
Air ball!

24:25.325 --> 24:27.051
Shoot it! Shoot it!

24:27.051 --> 24:28.052
I think that's a foul!

24:30.986 --> 24:32.298
Oh, you suck, bro.

24:33.023 --> 24:34.403
Hey, pass it to me.

24:34.852 --> 24:36.475
Yes! Yes!

24:36.475 --> 24:37.855
He did it!

24:43.240 --> 24:45.104
Why didn't you
let me play?

24:45.104 --> 24:47.002
You know Jamie shoots
nothing but bricks.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.073
It's time to go,
little bro.

24:49.073 --> 24:50.143
Wait. Where am I going?

24:52.905 --> 24:54.147
Well, you're
going home.

24:54.147 --> 24:55.804
But I wanna
play with you.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.599
You're going home.
It's getting late.

24:57.599 --> 24:59.601
Mom's gonna be worried.
You know, you got homework.

24:59.601 --> 25:01.500
But you never did
your homework.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.949
I'm not
as smart as you.

25:02.949 --> 25:04.364
You got a brain.
You can use it.

25:04.364 --> 25:05.504
You need
to go study.

25:06.332 --> 25:07.333
Come on.

25:14.374 --> 25:15.583
Dunk it up your ass.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.591
Whoo!

25:41.194 --> 25:44.163
No, let me go!

25:44.163 --> 25:46.096
Let me out of here!

25:47.304 --> 25:48.857
This kid is great.

25:48.857 --> 25:50.341
That is fucking,
it's true and he--

25:50.341 --> 25:53.344
He continuously just
does not run the ball.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.520
You know, you don't
have to be dealing

25:56.520 --> 25:58.177
with something
like this, after...

25:59.212 --> 26:00.420
After what?
What do you mean?

26:00.420 --> 26:01.698
You know, Lucas.

26:04.355 --> 26:05.909
Oh, Christ.

26:05.909 --> 26:07.600
Are you talking
about my daughter?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.740
Well, yeah. And...

26:09.740 --> 26:12.605
Maria, I'm dealing with it
the best way I know how.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.676
I'm just saying,
if it were me,

26:14.676 --> 26:15.884
I'd be gone in a heartbeat.

26:15.884 --> 26:17.817
Well, it ain't you.
And I'm not you.

26:18.611 --> 26:19.647
Come on now.

26:21.683 --> 26:23.305
I'm no shrink.

26:25.342 --> 26:27.309
That's for fucking sure,
you aren't a shrink.

26:31.659 --> 26:32.625
What?

26:35.248 --> 26:36.940
- I'm just gonna be your friend.
- Thank you.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.355
Okay.

26:38.355 --> 26:39.977
Be great.
You know what friends do?

26:39.977 --> 26:41.082
They order shots.

26:41.082 --> 26:43.256
Why don't you
- buy me a shot?
- Okay.

26:43.256 --> 26:44.982
Get us
- a couple of shots.
- Okay.

26:44.982 --> 26:46.708
Okay? Come on. Fine.

26:54.785 --> 26:57.616
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

26:57.616 --> 26:59.928
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

27:01.758 --> 27:03.794
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

27:06.141 --> 27:08.557
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

27:15.047 --> 27:17.359
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

27:19.499 --> 27:21.674
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

27:23.572 --> 27:25.505
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

27:27.438 --> 27:29.889
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

27:31.408 --> 27:33.513
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

27:35.826 --> 27:37.448
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

27:38.898 --> 27:40.797
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

27:43.385 --> 27:45.940
Humu mimi nitakamata tani.

27:47.527 --> 27:49.322
Humu mimi kuwa tani.

29:21.173 --> 29:23.934
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

29:23.934 --> 29:26.419
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

29:28.594 --> 29:30.769
He was called in
missing about one a.m.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.909
Some kids found him here.

29:32.909 --> 29:36.084
Wife said,
he goes out fishing,
but never out past 10:00.

29:36.084 --> 29:37.741
My guess is that
he came upon something

29:37.741 --> 29:39.087
he wasn't supposed to see.

29:39.087 --> 29:40.537
Yeah.
Anything else?

29:40.537 --> 29:41.987
Oh, yeah.
There's more.

29:41.987 --> 29:43.436
You're gonna
wanna see this.

29:50.754 --> 29:53.619
<i>Mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

29:53.619 --> 29:55.586
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

29:56.484 --> 29:57.657
What do we got, Nick?

29:57.657 --> 30:00.005
Hispanic male,
about 10 years old.

30:00.005 --> 30:02.628
Looks exactly like
what we saw
at the river yesterday.

30:02.628 --> 30:03.663
Shit.

30:42.288 --> 30:43.842
Nick, make sure
I get a picture
of that, please.

30:43.842 --> 30:44.877
Okay.

30:50.262 --> 30:51.815
<i>The old man
would've died anyway</i>

30:51.815 --> 30:53.748
from his throat
being cut,

30:53.748 --> 30:56.475
if he'd had a heart left
to pump the blood out.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.890
What?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.927
His heart had been
sliced out clean,

30:59.927 --> 31:02.343
and there was no blood
in his throat.

31:02.343 --> 31:05.484
So whoever did this,
it was awfully quick.

31:05.484 --> 31:07.382
I mean, when you say
quick, like, how quick?

31:07.382 --> 31:09.453
I mean, like his heart
might've still been beating.

31:09.453 --> 31:10.938
But what about
the heart? Did you find it?

31:10.938 --> 31:12.146
No.

31:12.146 --> 31:13.664
No?
- No. Didn't find it.

31:15.770 --> 31:17.737
What about the boy?

31:17.737 --> 31:19.774
Well, the boy
was like the first girl.

31:19.774 --> 31:21.534
- Yeah?
- Mutilated.

31:21.534 --> 31:24.952
Parts cut off. Missing.

31:24.952 --> 31:29.025
One thing. Whatever
this guy is using,

31:29.025 --> 31:30.302
is sharp as hell.

31:30.302 --> 31:31.855
Okay.

31:31.855 --> 31:33.615
Want a little snoot?

31:33.615 --> 31:34.927
Got some
good whiskey here.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.204
Yeah, I'll take
a little snoot.

31:37.033 --> 31:38.275
And there's
another, uh...

31:39.173 --> 31:40.726
another thing interesting.

31:40.726 --> 31:41.969
Yeah?

31:41.969 --> 31:44.557
Remember those things
you brought from the altar?

31:44.557 --> 31:45.765
Yes, sir.

31:46.697 --> 31:47.975
Well...

31:50.805 --> 31:51.840
Cheers.

31:55.534 --> 31:56.776
This one...

31:59.193 --> 32:00.988
It's finely
powdered gold.

32:02.299 --> 32:03.369
What do you
mean, gold?

32:03.369 --> 32:05.578
Like Fort Knox Gold.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.166
No shit.

32:08.478 --> 32:09.513
And these...

32:11.136 --> 32:13.586
These are some
- herbs you brought.
- Yeah?

32:13.586 --> 32:15.657
I've been able
to ID one of 'em.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.246
And it's, uh,

32:18.246 --> 32:19.834
something called rooibos.

32:20.317 --> 32:22.181
What's that?

32:22.181 --> 32:23.976
Well, there's been
some research on it.

32:23.976 --> 32:26.565
It's from Africa.
It's a red tea.

32:26.565 --> 32:28.670
Mmm. It ain't
that kinda tea though.

32:30.258 --> 32:31.294
Thanks, Bill.

32:31.294 --> 32:32.502
Not like you drink.

32:53.316 --> 32:55.007
Shit. Excuse me.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.733
Do you know where
Dr. Mackles' office is?

32:56.733 --> 32:58.252
- That way.
- It's back this way?

32:58.252 --> 32:59.253
- Yeah.
- Gosh.

33:16.511 --> 33:17.685
Come in.

33:22.138 --> 33:23.932
May I help you?

33:23.932 --> 33:25.003
Well, I hope so.

33:26.521 --> 33:27.695
Are you Dr. Mackles?

33:28.109 --> 33:29.179
Yes.

33:29.179 --> 33:30.939
I'm homicide
detective Lucas Boyd.

33:32.562 --> 33:33.597
Do you mind if I sit?

33:36.428 --> 33:39.810
So, you teach
African studies,
is that right?

33:39.810 --> 33:41.433
Yes.

33:42.434 --> 33:43.573
Are you
from Africa?

33:44.470 --> 33:46.438
Yes. Lesotho.

33:47.508 --> 33:49.268
Where is that at?

33:49.268 --> 33:51.822
It's a small country
in the heart of South Africa.

33:51.822 --> 33:52.858
Oh.

33:53.617 --> 33:56.689
Is my being African
important?

33:56.689 --> 33:58.346
Well, again,
I hope so.

33:58.346 --> 34:00.452
Do you, uh, know
what rooibos is?

34:02.454 --> 34:04.663
Yes. It's tea.

34:05.215 --> 34:06.182
Just tea?

34:08.184 --> 34:10.738
Well, it's sometimes
used medicinally.

34:10.738 --> 34:11.808
Mmm-hmm.

34:17.676 --> 34:20.989
Um, smell this,
and tell me what
it is, will you?

34:38.006 --> 34:39.077
Where did you get this?

34:40.871 --> 34:43.150
Why? What is it?

34:47.602 --> 34:50.398
Dr. Mackles.
What is it?

34:52.124 --> 34:54.885
It's... herbs.

34:56.956 --> 34:58.889
Mmm-hmm.
Just any kind of herbs?

35:00.581 --> 35:02.997
Well, I would say
yohimbe bark

35:02.997 --> 35:08.106
and, uh, some other
fermented tree roots.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.590
Hmm.

35:09.590 --> 35:10.936
Where'd you get it?

35:11.937 --> 35:13.111
I found it
at a crime scene.

35:21.049 --> 35:22.499
What kind of crime?

35:25.053 --> 35:26.676
Well, I'm a homicide
detective, sir.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.584
Can you tell me
what these writings are?

35:44.072 --> 35:46.040
You could easily
google this, Detective.

35:46.040 --> 35:48.076
I know. I know.
And I actually did.

35:48.076 --> 35:49.181
It didn't
make sense to me.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.253
But then I did Google

35:52.253 --> 35:55.291
leading scholars
in African culture,
and your name came up,

35:55.291 --> 35:56.775
as the best
and brightest.

35:57.431 --> 35:59.916
So, here I am.

36:04.438 --> 36:07.682
I'm sorry.
I cannot help you.

36:11.272 --> 36:14.965
Well, I appreciate
your time, sir.

37:06.293 --> 37:08.018
I'm just looking
for someone.

37:09.088 --> 37:10.124
A ghost.

37:12.989 --> 37:14.439
I need to put a name
to this face.

37:17.718 --> 37:18.788
I've seen him around.

37:18.788 --> 37:19.892
Great.

37:21.135 --> 37:23.275
He's my main suspect
in some strange killings.

37:25.553 --> 37:26.554
We found an altar.

37:26.554 --> 37:28.349
Blood.

37:28.349 --> 37:29.833
I don't really know
what it means.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.425
He's a Sangoma.

37:37.565 --> 37:38.601
Sangoma?

37:39.947 --> 37:40.982
Touched by God.

37:41.638 --> 37:42.812
A witch doctor.

37:43.606 --> 37:44.917
He works for clients.

37:46.781 --> 37:47.851
What kind of clients?

37:49.922 --> 37:51.372
Rich and powerful ones.

37:54.375 --> 37:56.170
May I give you
a word of advice?

37:56.791 --> 37:57.999
Mmm-hmm.

37:58.793 --> 38:00.036
Be careful.

38:01.313 --> 38:02.694
He could be
coming for you.

38:13.808 --> 38:14.809
Thank you.

38:17.881 --> 38:18.917
Is everything okay?

38:45.012 --> 38:46.979
Dr. Mackles,
I need your help.

38:48.049 --> 38:50.258
God dam it,
two kids are dead.

38:50.258 --> 38:52.053
They were
butchered like hogs.

38:53.227 --> 38:55.125
You know what these
writings are, don't you?

38:56.679 --> 38:57.990
Now, please,

38:58.922 --> 39:00.027
take another look.

39:02.719 --> 39:04.652
I cannot help you.

39:05.860 --> 39:06.896
Can't or won't?

39:16.043 --> 39:17.216
You're scared,
aren't you?

39:50.077 --> 39:51.596
Watch your step, doctor.

40:06.783 --> 40:07.784
Oh.

40:14.032 --> 40:15.274
What is it, doctor?

40:16.759 --> 40:18.726
It's Swahili.

40:19.555 --> 40:20.832
Zulu.

40:20.832 --> 40:22.040
Hmm.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.835
It identifies territory.

40:24.698 --> 40:26.113
Identifies how?

40:27.045 --> 40:29.012
Uh, centers
of power, or...

40:29.910 --> 40:32.740
ways to get access
to that power.

40:33.948 --> 40:36.641
Do me a favor. Can you
read that right there?

40:37.573 --> 40:40.507
Well, roughly.

40:45.684 --> 40:49.481
Uh, "Here
I take the power.

40:49.481 --> 40:52.104
"Here I become the power."

40:54.279 --> 40:56.074
Your man is a Sangoma.

40:57.178 --> 40:59.387
A medicine man.

40:59.387 --> 41:01.562
In your culture, you would
call him a witch doctor.

41:04.220 --> 41:06.153
The way he's killing,
that makes sense.

41:09.087 --> 41:11.503
You ever hear the term
<i>"Muti,"</i> Detective?

41:11.883 --> 41:12.987
No.

41:14.817 --> 41:17.060
It's Zulu.
It means medicine.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.062
But, Muti has
a dark side.

41:21.479 --> 41:26.035
So, are you saying
that he is using
the body parts for medicine?

41:26.898 --> 41:28.106
Exactly.

41:28.106 --> 41:29.279
- Right.
- Well,

41:29.279 --> 41:31.040
you know, pharmaceutical companies

41:31.040 --> 41:34.871
use stem cells from aborted
fetuses to create vaccines.

41:34.871 --> 41:35.976
Right.

41:35.976 --> 41:37.495
Well, this is just
a primitive version

41:37.495 --> 41:38.979
of that concept.

41:38.979 --> 41:40.359
I'm listening.

41:40.359 --> 41:42.051
Well, in
a metaphysical sense,

41:42.051 --> 41:45.917
<i>it can be tied to
what can be referred to</i>

41:45.917 --> 41:48.022
<i>as "the warrior tradition."</i>

41:48.022 --> 41:50.991
<i>Put simply, it's a ritual
performed to order.</i>

41:50.991 --> 41:52.682
<i>To make one a warrior,</i>

41:52.682 --> 41:55.927
<i>or to provide power
to that warrior.</i>

41:55.927 --> 42:00.000
<i>Sangomas have been
practicing</i> Muti <i>for centuries.</i>

42:04.832 --> 42:09.078
<i>Businessmen,
politicians, salesmen, you,</i>

42:09.078 --> 42:10.458
<i>anyone.</i>

42:11.356 --> 42:15.015
<i>People who pay for</i> Muti
<i>are seeking</i>

42:15.015 --> 42:16.775
<i>personal success,</i>

42:16.775 --> 42:17.880
<i>power,</i>

42:17.880 --> 42:19.571
<i>protection.</i>

42:19.571 --> 42:24.818
<i>They believe that</i> Muti
<i>strengthens their
personal force,</i>

42:24.818 --> 42:26.302
<i>gives them an edge.</i>

42:29.892 --> 42:33.896
In <i>Muti,</i>
specific body parts

42:33.896 --> 42:35.345
have a distinct effect.

42:35.345 --> 42:36.554
Mmm-hmm.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.384
Genitals,

42:39.384 --> 42:44.734
they bring virility,
good luck.

42:44.734 --> 42:48.220
Especially if
- they're virgin.
- Right.

42:48.220 --> 42:51.189
The eyes, farsightedness,

42:51.189 --> 42:52.639
clarity of vision.

42:53.053 --> 42:54.226
The brain,

42:55.089 --> 42:56.953
knowledge,
political power.

42:56.953 --> 42:58.196
Mmm-hmm.

42:58.196 --> 43:01.095
The Sangoma takes
whatever they need

43:01.095 --> 43:02.269
for a specific outcome.

43:05.030 --> 43:07.654
- Jesus Christ.
- But, there's more.

43:09.241 --> 43:14.384
A Sangoman must
take the flesh

43:14.384 --> 43:16.559
while the victim
is still alive...

43:16.559 --> 43:17.629
Right.

43:18.665 --> 43:20.874
In order to get
the power they seek...

43:20.874 --> 43:22.082
Mmm-hmm.

43:22.082 --> 43:24.118
...they must awaken
the gods to bestow it.

43:25.706 --> 43:27.052
Which means...

43:28.122 --> 43:29.883
the screams
of the victim...

43:29.883 --> 43:31.263
Right.

43:31.263 --> 43:32.299
...are critical.

43:33.680 --> 43:36.061
The more intense
the scream,

43:37.028 --> 43:39.168
the more powerful
the <i>Muti.</i>

43:40.583 --> 43:45.761
Then the body parts
are mixed with
the victim's blood,

43:46.624 --> 43:49.074
herbs, clay, gold,

43:49.074 --> 43:50.420
all of which is believed

43:50.420 --> 43:53.423
to attract and hold power.

43:55.322 --> 43:59.637
That elixir is drunk
by the client
or the Sangoma,

44:00.534 --> 44:04.158
in order to get
the power they seek.

44:06.609 --> 44:08.749
They believe
that it turns them
into a warrior.

44:08.749 --> 44:09.992
Makes them a warrior.

44:09.992 --> 44:11.614
And an undefeatable one.

44:13.340 --> 44:14.755
Sounds unbelievable
to me.

44:15.825 --> 44:18.241
Right. To you, Detective.

44:18.241 --> 44:22.521
To him,
it's simply business.
And very real.

44:23.177 --> 44:24.523
Very real.

44:27.319 --> 44:28.907
Whatever he's
about to do,

44:30.771 --> 44:32.911
it feels he needs
power to do it.

44:32.911 --> 44:33.912
Mmm-hmm.

44:35.293 --> 44:36.294
And understand this.

44:37.882 --> 44:38.952
These first two,

44:40.194 --> 44:41.748
they were just
him getting ready.

44:42.887 --> 44:44.371
He did them for himself.

44:46.994 --> 44:47.995
<i>Capisce?</i>

44:52.241 --> 44:53.898
Do you really
believe in this?

44:55.451 --> 44:58.385
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

45:01.629 --> 45:03.217
This is just
too sick.

45:04.460 --> 45:08.119
I mean, Maria,
it's sick enough
to be real, you know.

45:08.119 --> 45:10.362
I just wish I could see
this motherfucker's face.

45:13.849 --> 45:15.574
All I see right now
is a monster.

45:38.701 --> 45:41.566
I want one that's beautiful.
One with pretty eyes.

45:42.567 --> 45:47.158
One filled with
life and promise.

45:47.158 --> 45:49.367
Oh, I want her to have
a great deal of intelligence.

45:51.472 --> 45:54.544
And so much more
to live for.

46:34.032 --> 46:34.999
Welcome.

46:37.553 --> 46:39.348
What can I
- get for you?
- Tequila.

46:41.246 --> 46:42.661
Neat, or on the rocks?

46:42.661 --> 46:43.870
Neat. Okay.

46:48.322 --> 46:49.323
Are you
new in town?

46:50.600 --> 46:51.601
Yes.

46:52.395 --> 46:53.741
Vacation?

46:53.741 --> 46:55.398
- No, work.
- Mmm.

46:56.503 --> 46:57.504
That's a really
cool accent.

46:58.539 --> 46:59.575
I like it.
Where is it from?

47:00.507 --> 47:02.474
I've been
so many places.

47:02.474 --> 47:03.613
It is hard to say.

47:12.139 --> 47:13.451
May I be honest?

47:13.451 --> 47:14.486
Oh, sure.

47:15.902 --> 47:17.800
I like your eyes.

47:17.800 --> 47:18.939
Thank you.

47:20.389 --> 47:22.287
They are lovely.
Stop it.

47:25.773 --> 47:26.982
I mean it.

47:26.982 --> 47:27.983
I really like them.

47:28.569 --> 47:29.570
Thank you.

47:30.295 --> 47:31.296
I really mean it, too.

47:34.817 --> 47:35.818
Hey.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.858
I could use
eyes like that.

47:45.379 --> 47:46.449
My name is Randoku.

47:51.247 --> 47:52.214
What is your name?

47:53.387 --> 47:54.388
Randoku.

47:55.286 --> 47:56.287
I like that.

47:58.703 --> 47:59.704
I'm Terry.

48:02.534 --> 48:04.778
Tell me all
about yourself, Terry.

48:19.068 --> 48:20.828
This is just
a summer job for me.

48:21.968 --> 48:23.521
- You are in school?
- Yeah.

48:23.521 --> 48:25.178
Yeah. I'm pre-med
at the university.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.870
So, you are smart.

48:27.870 --> 48:29.907
I guess.

48:29.907 --> 48:33.117
This matches the van
that was reported stolen
two weeks ago.

48:33.117 --> 48:34.118
Clear here?

48:35.636 --> 48:36.810
Yeah,
it's clear here.

48:38.812 --> 48:41.470
Mmm, you wouldn't really
know it from meeting me
in this place,

48:41.470 --> 48:44.507
but, I'm in the top
one percent of my class.

48:44.507 --> 48:46.233
I like that.

48:46.233 --> 48:47.855
Let's see
if Terry knows anything.

48:56.450 --> 48:58.073
Hey, Terry.
- Hey.

49:00.489 --> 49:02.732
Either of you
wouldn't happen to know
anything about that van...

49:22.373 --> 49:23.684
<i>No, no. I get it.</i>

49:23.684 --> 49:26.239
It's a witch doctor
from Africa...

49:26.239 --> 49:27.619
Yeah,
- that's right.
- And I should

49:27.619 --> 49:29.345
believe this
because what?

49:29.345 --> 49:32.038
According to Dr. Mackles,
he's servicing a client.

49:33.832 --> 49:34.833
Hmm.

49:36.801 --> 49:38.078
You believe
in this shit?

49:38.078 --> 49:39.942
You know what,
I wanna go back to work.

49:39.942 --> 49:41.530
Hey, Boyd. Sit down.

49:41.530 --> 49:43.152
Boyd!

49:43.152 --> 49:44.395
I think he's
onto something.

49:44.878 --> 49:46.224
Yeah, like what?

49:46.224 --> 49:47.985
Captain, we have
two officers down.

49:49.434 --> 49:50.401
Get Boyd.

50:22.605 --> 50:23.606
Is your name Terry?

50:25.781 --> 50:27.093
Ma'am?

50:28.542 --> 50:29.854
Hey, it's okay.

50:31.269 --> 50:33.340
I need to ask you
a few questions, okay,

50:33.340 --> 50:36.136
and if you can
help me out with that,

50:36.136 --> 50:37.655
then maybe
we can find this guy.

50:37.655 --> 50:39.174
Are you gonna
help me out? Yeah?

50:39.174 --> 50:41.107
- Sure.
- Yeah? All right.

50:41.107 --> 50:43.074
So, tell me, what,
what did he look like?

50:43.902 --> 50:45.559
Was he big,
tall, or what?

50:45.559 --> 50:46.871
- He was big.
- Yeah?

50:46.871 --> 50:48.355
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

50:48.355 --> 50:50.978
When you say big,
like, over six feet,
or what?

50:50.978 --> 50:52.842
- I think so.
- Mm-hmm.

50:52.842 --> 50:54.396
Black? White?
Where?

50:55.673 --> 50:57.226
- He was a black guy.
- He was.

50:58.020 --> 51:00.022
He was kind of handsome.

51:00.022 --> 51:01.748
Yeah.

51:01.748 --> 51:06.097
And, he was covered
with scarification
on his face.

51:06.097 --> 51:07.409
He had scarring
on his face?

51:08.513 --> 51:11.482
Did you get a name
by any chance? Yeah?

51:11.482 --> 51:13.380
What was his name?

51:13.380 --> 51:15.037
Terry, what was his name?

51:15.520 --> 51:16.556
Randoku.

51:16.556 --> 51:18.592
- Randoku?
- Randoku.

51:18.592 --> 51:19.697
Okay.

51:19.697 --> 51:21.423
All right, come on.
Let me get you up.

51:21.423 --> 51:23.252
Come on.
Let me help you.

51:24.978 --> 51:25.979
Maria.

51:30.984 --> 51:33.814
We got a name. Randoku.

51:33.814 --> 51:35.299
Go on, let's sort
that out. Come on.

51:39.199 --> 51:40.166
Jimmy, anything?

51:41.408 --> 51:43.824
Yeah.
Lots of anythings.

51:43.824 --> 51:47.587
- Yeah?
- Got a thumb, forefinger,
ring finger.

51:47.587 --> 51:48.933
Okay.

51:48.933 --> 51:50.590
Good thing your boy
likes tequila.

51:51.970 --> 51:54.939
You're saying he's
about 6, 6'3", 6'4" maybe?6'4", I would say, yeah.

51:54.939 --> 51:57.390
Jimmy, give me a name
on these prints.

51:57.390 --> 51:59.012
These weird, uh,
scars on his face.

51:59.012 --> 52:00.807
Scars on his face.
Thank you.
Thank you. Boyd.

52:00.807 --> 52:02.567
This lady said she just seen
a black guy coming in and out

52:02.567 --> 52:03.948
of that unfinished
apartment building.

52:03.948 --> 52:05.674
Hadn't seen him around
until a few days ago.

52:05.674 --> 52:07.469
Said he has
scars on his face.

52:07.469 --> 52:08.780
That's our guy.
Come on, let's go.

52:08.780 --> 52:10.092
Hey, Keith.

52:10.092 --> 52:12.198
Watch the front.
Let's go. Come on.

52:12.198 --> 52:13.958
Come on.
Gotta go! Gotta go!

52:33.805 --> 52:35.117
I want everybody on two.

52:35.635 --> 52:36.774
And let's communicate.

52:36.774 --> 52:37.878
Roger that.

52:37.878 --> 52:39.708
Bobby,
- you stay here.
- Copy that.

54:31.682 --> 54:32.752
He's been here.

54:49.493 --> 54:50.459
Fuck.

55:02.402 --> 55:03.438
There he goes!

55:03.438 --> 55:05.232
Shit! He's coming back
on the third floor.

56:04.326 --> 56:06.363
Freeze!
Claussen get the fuck down!

56:08.123 --> 56:10.643
Officer down.
Officer down!

56:10.643 --> 56:11.851
Son of a bitch!

56:11.851 --> 56:13.197
<i>Backup. Hang in with me now.</i>

56:13.197 --> 56:15.510
Fuck!
We got officers down.
Go, go, go!

56:15.510 --> 56:17.063
<i>Officer down. He's injured.</i>

56:24.001 --> 56:25.796
Maria, let's get out of here.
Let's go.

56:30.904 --> 56:31.905
Maria, let's go.

56:34.494 --> 56:35.461
Yo, let's go.

56:38.878 --> 56:40.120
Jesus Christ.

56:42.053 --> 56:43.089
Okay, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

56:43.089 --> 56:44.401
Hey, give me
your fucking jacket!

56:48.163 --> 56:49.578
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go!

57:05.076 --> 57:06.664
I'm hoping
you see something
I wouldn't.

57:07.596 --> 57:08.563
I'll try.

57:13.878 --> 57:14.845
After you.

57:17.710 --> 57:19.056
So why'd you
come here
to America?

57:20.333 --> 57:21.748
New start, I guess.

57:21.748 --> 57:24.648
Yeah? You got
any family?

57:24.648 --> 57:27.374
No. My brothers
and sisters are
still back in Africa.

57:30.550 --> 57:31.655
Take a look
at this.

57:32.690 --> 57:35.106
My father
worked in medicine.

57:36.556 --> 57:37.902
He worked
with the tribes.

57:39.283 --> 57:40.595
My mother worked
with him.

57:41.837 --> 57:42.804
Mmm.

57:44.253 --> 57:45.289
Well,
for what it's worth,

57:45.289 --> 57:46.911
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this shit.

57:47.394 --> 57:48.395
No, you're not.

57:49.638 --> 57:50.605
You're right. I'm not.

57:52.020 --> 57:54.367
You know,
in certain cultures,

57:54.367 --> 57:57.474
I could have your head
or another body part.

57:58.336 --> 57:59.855
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

57:59.855 --> 58:01.788
As an apology
to make me feel better.

58:01.788 --> 58:02.927
Mmm.

58:02.927 --> 58:06.897
Greece, Asia,
certain African tribes.

58:06.897 --> 58:09.416
If a certain member
of a tribe offended
another member

58:09.416 --> 58:12.454
by delving too deeply
into his personal affairs,

58:12.454 --> 58:14.801
the chief could have
that person killed

58:14.801 --> 58:17.424
and the body part
delivered as a gift.

58:17.424 --> 58:18.460
Hmm.

58:19.254 --> 58:21.532
A way of saying,
problem solved.

58:24.052 --> 58:26.088
Well, thank God
that ain't legal
in this country.

58:26.088 --> 58:28.090
I'd be mailing out
body parts
all day long.

58:28.090 --> 58:29.333
Let me know
if you need anything.

59:23.801 --> 59:24.768
Nothing.

59:26.252 --> 59:27.253
Sorry, Detective.

59:32.914 --> 59:33.880
You're still here?

59:35.123 --> 59:36.849
This fucker killed
two of my men.

59:37.850 --> 59:38.816
You're okay?

59:41.923 --> 59:45.133
Ten children in Tanzania
kidnapped and killed
for body parts.

59:46.099 --> 59:48.585
A dozen children
in Spain.

59:48.585 --> 59:50.966
Thousand of children are
missing all across Europe.

59:50.966 --> 59:52.899
And you ask me
how I'm doing?

59:52.899 --> 59:53.969
You can't
let it get to you.

59:54.936 --> 59:56.593
That's what I keep
telling myself.

59:58.008 --> 1:00:00.251
But how hard does your heart
have to get in order to live?

1:00:01.977 --> 1:00:03.220
Maybe you
should go home.

1:00:04.117 --> 1:00:05.291
Be with your family.

1:00:06.223 --> 1:00:07.293
My family, yeah.

1:00:08.087 --> 1:00:09.606
You're right.

1:00:11.469 --> 1:00:14.611
I think
there comes a day
in everyone's life where

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:16.716
they realize
they don't really
matter much.

1:00:18.373 --> 1:00:20.030
Whatever their goals are

1:00:20.030 --> 1:00:21.445
really don't
amount to shit.

1:00:24.793 --> 1:00:26.381
And that is
a very sad day.

1:00:28.176 --> 1:00:29.177
Oh, thank you.

1:00:39.463 --> 1:00:41.189
You're a fucking
piece of work, Lucas.

1:00:44.261 --> 1:00:45.849
<i>You're a fucking...</i> LUCAS: <i>We're not doing this.</i>

1:00:45.849 --> 1:00:47.851
<i>We're not doing this again?
We're not doing this again?</i>

1:00:47.851 --> 1:00:48.921
<i>You know what
you're not gonna do it?</i>

1:00:48.921 --> 1:00:50.819
You fell asleep again!

1:00:50.819 --> 1:00:52.476
You're gonna go
sleep again, yeah?

1:00:52.476 --> 1:00:55.203
Yeah, like you did before?

1:00:55.203 --> 1:00:56.653
<i>Come on,
what do you want me to say?</i>

1:00:56.653 --> 1:00:57.895
<i>You fucking
piece of... LUCAS: Come on.</i>

1:00:57.895 --> 1:00:59.966
- Son of a bitch!
Come on, come on.

1:01:14.429 --> 1:01:15.913
I need some
of your brew.

1:01:17.432 --> 1:01:18.433
Come on in.

1:01:29.340 --> 1:01:30.687
What's going on?
You doing okay?

1:01:31.446 --> 1:01:32.447
Yeah.

1:01:35.208 --> 1:01:38.695
I take it you never saw
that shrink, did you?

1:01:40.835 --> 1:01:41.801
Mmm.

1:01:43.078 --> 1:01:44.735
There was something
that I wanted to show you,

1:01:44.735 --> 1:01:47.565
I found in Randoku's apartment
the other day.

1:01:47.565 --> 1:01:50.223
Look at this. It's, uh,
it's Farner Ltd.

1:01:50.223 --> 1:01:53.882
It's a multibillion dollar, multinational,
mega corporation.

1:01:53.882 --> 1:01:55.953
- Good one.
- Have you ever heard of...

1:01:55.953 --> 1:01:58.369
Farner company.
I know that asshole.

1:01:59.267 --> 1:02:01.787
Donates a lot of money.

1:02:01.787 --> 1:02:03.305
I don't know.
I guess the question
is though

1:02:03.305 --> 1:02:05.169
is what they're
talking about here
is that

1:02:05.169 --> 1:02:06.895
there's a big vote Tuesday.

1:02:06.895 --> 1:02:08.586
How important
do you think
this is to him?

1:02:11.762 --> 1:02:12.729
Hold.

1:02:14.213 --> 1:02:15.214
It's Lucas.

1:02:18.424 --> 1:02:21.323
They have something
in forensics.
We'll be right down. Thanks.

1:02:21.323 --> 1:02:23.463
I got this
from the bar.

1:02:23.463 --> 1:02:25.534
But there were
no matches
in US database,

1:02:25.534 --> 1:02:27.744
so, I checked Interpol,
and I got this.

1:02:28.330 --> 1:02:29.953
When I superimpose them,

1:02:30.712 --> 1:02:33.611
I give you one
M'Gushu Randoku.

1:02:33.611 --> 1:02:36.822
Born in South Africa,
Zulu heritage.

1:02:36.822 --> 1:02:39.445
Says he was
in Rome recently.

1:02:39.445 --> 1:02:41.412
What about
his port of entry?
Where was it?

1:02:41.412 --> 1:02:42.724
Uh...

1:02:44.346 --> 1:02:46.107
Came into New Orleans
a week ago.

1:02:46.107 --> 1:02:47.418
Anything else?

1:02:47.418 --> 1:02:50.042
Well, yeah.
Old M'Gushu here?

1:02:50.042 --> 1:02:51.595
Been dead for six years.

1:02:52.147 --> 1:02:54.218
Here's his

1:02:54.218 --> 1:02:56.876
death certificate signed
by a Sudanese General.

1:02:56.876 --> 1:02:58.429
That doesn't
mean he's dead.

1:02:58.429 --> 1:03:02.709
It might just mean
he has friends in high places
who can help him disappear.

1:03:02.709 --> 1:03:04.884
He ain't dead. Not yet.

1:03:09.095 --> 1:03:10.062
Hey, Lucas.

1:03:11.339 --> 1:03:12.340
Yeah?

1:03:12.996 --> 1:03:14.860
How's Kersch?

1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:16.723
She's fighting
for her life, Claussen.

1:03:17.794 --> 1:03:19.278
Check this out.

1:03:19.278 --> 1:03:21.280
This was
in Randoku's place.

1:03:23.765 --> 1:03:26.112
- Shit.
- Not sure
what it's about.

1:03:26.112 --> 1:03:27.527
You know what, I'll look
- into it, thanks.
- All right.

1:03:27.976 --> 1:03:28.943
You got it.

1:03:55.417 --> 1:03:56.971
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

1:03:56.971 --> 1:03:58.765
Yes.
Can I help you?

1:03:58.765 --> 1:04:01.527
<i>This is Detective Lucas Boyd.
I'm calling from America.</i>

1:04:01.527 --> 1:04:06.325
I need to speak to a uh,
I think it's
Inspector, uh, Mario Lavazzi?

1:04:06.325 --> 1:04:08.741
I'm sorry, but he's
left for the day, Detective.

1:04:08.741 --> 1:04:10.950
Okay, well,
you don't understand.
This is an emergency.

1:04:10.950 --> 1:04:13.263
I'm investigating a murder
of two children.

1:04:13.263 --> 1:04:15.368
Now, I'd love
if you could get him
on the cell phone or his home.

1:04:15.368 --> 1:04:17.370
I don't give a fuck
where he is.
Just call him.

1:04:17.370 --> 1:04:19.579
<i>Okay, okay.</i> Scusi.
<i>I find him.</i>

1:04:23.411 --> 1:04:25.068
<i>Si?</i> Inspector Lavazzi?

1:04:25.068 --> 1:04:27.380
<i>Yes.</i> LUCAS:
<i>I'm Detective Lucas Boyd.</i>

1:04:27.380 --> 1:04:29.589
<i>I'm investigating a murder
of two children.</i>

1:04:30.728 --> 1:04:33.110
Um, one of the suspects
that we're looking for

1:04:33.110 --> 1:04:35.872
is a man by the name of
M'Gushu Randoku.

1:04:36.907 --> 1:04:39.841
<i>He's killed two children
here in America.</i>

1:04:39.841 --> 1:04:43.120
The interesting thing
is we found your card
at his apartment.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:44.708
Is there
a reason for that?

1:04:44.708 --> 1:04:47.193
He was kidnapping young women
all throughout Europe.

1:04:47.884 --> 1:04:48.885
<i>Whoa, what'd you say?</i>

1:04:50.645 --> 1:04:54.891
He was kidnapping young women
all throughout Europe, Detective.

1:04:54.891 --> 1:04:57.445
I almost caught him
here in Rome a few weeks ago.

1:04:57.445 --> 1:04:59.757
But the son of a bitch
got away.

1:04:59.757 --> 1:05:01.311
Okay, well, is there anything
you can help me with?

1:05:01.311 --> 1:05:02.829
Because he's doing
the same thing here.

1:05:02.829 --> 1:05:04.003
I know who he works for.

1:05:04.417 --> 1:05:05.487
<i>Who?</i>

1:05:05.487 --> 1:05:07.558
I can't prove it.
I know it as a cop.

1:05:09.250 --> 1:05:12.011
Yeah, okay, well,
just talk to me
like a cop then.

1:05:12.011 --> 1:05:14.876
We found some CCTV footage
of Randoku meeting

1:05:14.876 --> 1:05:16.533
with a South African businessman.

1:05:17.396 --> 1:05:19.501
I later found out
his identity.

1:05:19.501 --> 1:05:21.572
His name is Shelby Farner.

1:05:22.332 --> 1:05:24.334
<i>F-A-R-N-E-R.</i>

1:05:24.990 --> 1:05:26.129
<i>Farner.</i>

1:05:26.129 --> 1:05:27.164
I appreciate it.

1:05:28.027 --> 1:05:30.029
Thank you.

1:05:32.307 --> 1:05:34.102
<i>Prego,</i> Detective. <i>Prego.</i>

1:05:59.334 --> 1:06:01.958
- Can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm Detective Boyd.

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:03.269
Is Shelby Farner around?

1:06:03.269 --> 1:06:04.339
Yes, he is.

1:06:04.339 --> 1:06:06.341
Go get him for me, please.
- All right.
- Okay.

1:06:21.908 --> 1:06:23.945
Mr. Farner?
- Yes.

1:06:23.945 --> 1:06:25.809
Detective Boyd.
Do you mind if
we have a word?

1:06:26.499 --> 1:06:27.811
Certainly. Uh...

1:06:27.811 --> 1:06:29.537
- Come with me.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1:06:31.815 --> 1:06:35.784
- What are you doing?
- You touch another
fucking kid in my city,

1:06:35.784 --> 1:06:37.683
and I'm gonna fucking
put a bullet in your head.

1:06:37.683 --> 1:06:40.513
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna put
a fucking bullet in your head.

1:06:41.411 --> 1:06:43.171
You hear me?

1:06:43.171 --> 1:06:46.002
Obviously,
you don't know
who you're talking to.

1:06:48.521 --> 1:06:50.316
You want
somebody strong?

1:06:50.316 --> 1:06:52.146
You want somebody strong,
you come get me.

1:06:52.905 --> 1:06:53.906
I'm right here.

1:06:55.321 --> 1:06:56.357
You know, I'm gonna
tell you something.

1:06:56.357 --> 1:06:58.497
After I get
your fucking partner,

1:06:58.497 --> 1:07:00.602
I'm coming after you.
And you know
what I'm gonna do?

1:07:00.602 --> 1:07:02.604
I'm gonna fucking
eat your liver.

1:07:59.005 --> 1:08:00.283
Exactly, yeah.

1:08:05.115 --> 1:08:07.255
All right, ladies.
Time to get ready.

1:08:07.255 --> 1:08:09.602
Get on your numbers.
Warm up.

1:08:09.602 --> 1:08:11.432
Ladies on the sideline,
warm up.

1:08:18.611 --> 1:08:19.612
Set!

1:08:34.386 --> 1:08:35.525
Whoo!

1:08:36.629 --> 1:08:38.597
- Good job, good job!
- Thank you.

1:08:39.253 --> 1:08:40.323
Whoo!

1:08:40.323 --> 1:08:41.669
Good job. High five!

1:08:42.497 --> 1:08:44.775
Good job.
Awesome.

1:08:59.652 --> 1:09:00.722
Hello.

1:09:02.517 --> 1:09:04.726
I just got threatened
by Mr. Randoku.

1:09:06.072 --> 1:09:07.867
I'm sorry to hear that,
Dr. Mackles.

1:09:08.420 --> 1:09:09.421
I'm not sorry.

1:09:10.801 --> 1:09:12.734
Fuck him.

1:09:12.734 --> 1:09:14.564
<i>Pick me up.</i> I'll be right there, yeah.

1:09:17.083 --> 1:09:19.810
I hear you're quite
the student athlete.

1:09:19.810 --> 1:09:21.260
I try my best, sir.

1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:22.951
Do you know that I have
a foundation

1:09:22.951 --> 1:09:26.403
Really?that offers scholarships
for girls like you?

1:09:26.403 --> 1:09:27.853
Well, do you
enjoy competition?

1:09:27.853 --> 1:09:29.579
- Oh, yeah.
- Always?

1:09:29.993 --> 1:09:32.202
Yeah, I mean,

1:09:32.202 --> 1:09:35.171
our coach tells us
that winning isn't everything,

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:37.863
but that giving it your best
is what it's all about.

1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:41.038
What's the point of
putting in all that work

1:09:41.038 --> 1:09:43.489
if you're not
trying to win?

1:09:43.489 --> 1:09:45.905
Ah, Katie,
you are just delightful.

1:09:45.905 --> 1:09:48.908
I'll bet you're
a straight A student.

1:09:48.908 --> 1:09:51.290
- Yes, sir. Straight A's.
- Delightful.

1:09:51.290 --> 1:09:54.776
And your favorite
subject is...

1:09:54.776 --> 1:09:56.778
A tie between
math and science.

1:09:58.504 --> 1:10:00.610
But I love music, too.

1:10:00.610 --> 1:10:04.165
And math is obviously
a big part of music, so...

1:10:04.165 --> 1:10:05.270
Obviously.

1:10:07.272 --> 1:10:09.584
So, how do you know
my parents?

1:10:09.584 --> 1:10:10.999
Oh, we've known
each other for ages.

1:10:11.655 --> 1:10:13.209
So weird.

1:10:13.209 --> 1:10:15.038
They never
mentioned you before.

1:10:15.038 --> 1:10:16.902
Well, I find
that difficult to believe.

1:10:16.902 --> 1:10:18.593
- They really haven't.
- Oh, come on!

1:10:18.593 --> 1:10:19.732
Really.

1:10:21.389 --> 1:10:25.428
Ah, Katie.
I can't tell you how
perfect you are.

1:10:26.256 --> 1:10:27.223
Thank you!

1:10:29.846 --> 1:10:30.847
Let's get Katie ready.

1:10:33.608 --> 1:10:34.816
Ready for what?

1:10:34.816 --> 1:10:35.955
Oh...

1:10:37.957 --> 1:10:39.235
It's a surprise.

1:11:03.328 --> 1:11:04.881
<i>Her name's Katie.</i>

1:11:04.881 --> 1:11:06.123
How are they
dealing with it?

1:11:06.123 --> 1:11:07.642
Well, usual.
Fed playbook.

1:11:08.643 --> 1:11:10.058
- No calls.
- Mm-hmm.

1:11:10.058 --> 1:11:11.163
No ransom demand.

1:11:12.544 --> 1:11:13.959
I need to tell them
about Randoku.

1:11:13.959 --> 1:11:16.306
Yeah. Well,
when you do,

1:11:16.306 --> 1:11:17.756
just take them
into the other room,
all right?

1:11:21.311 --> 1:11:22.278
It's him.

1:11:22.761 --> 1:11:23.762
Yeah, I know.

1:11:26.627 --> 1:11:28.594
Can I make
- a suggestion?
- Sure, yeah.

1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:33.289
If he is working
for Farner... Mm-hmm.

1:11:33.289 --> 1:11:36.464
...they're gonna want
to do the ceremony
at a very safe place.

1:11:38.121 --> 1:11:42.298
So I would look
for properties
owned by Farner.

1:11:42.298 --> 1:11:46.474
Especially
warehouse-type
near water.

1:11:46.474 --> 1:11:47.475
Mmm.

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:57.761
Give me some good news, Claussen.

1:11:57.761 --> 1:12:00.350
Farner Industries owns
a lot of property in town.

1:12:00.350 --> 1:12:01.834
They got one warehouse
by the river.

1:12:01.834 --> 1:12:03.249
I'm sending you
the address now.

1:12:04.181 --> 1:12:05.182
Got it. Thanks.

1:12:27.204 --> 1:12:28.344
You gotta stay here.

1:12:28.344 --> 1:12:29.345
Okay.

1:13:12.974 --> 1:13:15.425
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:13:16.288 --> 1:13:19.049
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

1:13:20.672 --> 1:13:22.674
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:13:24.469 --> 1:13:27.403
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:13:27.989 --> 1:13:30.509
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

1:13:32.925 --> 1:13:35.031
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:13:36.826 --> 1:13:38.828
<i>Humu kuwa tani.</i>

1:13:40.312 --> 1:13:43.073
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:13:43.073 --> 1:13:44.627
Please stop!

1:13:44.627 --> 1:13:46.491
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

1:13:48.734 --> 1:13:51.012
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:13:51.012 --> 1:13:52.151
No.

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:55.879
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

1:13:57.294 --> 1:13:59.918
<i>Humu mimi nitakamata tani.</i>

1:14:00.677 --> 1:14:02.610
<i>Humu mimi kuwa tani.</i>

1:14:02.610 --> 1:14:04.025
Drop the fucking knife!

1:14:04.854 --> 1:14:06.165
Do it now!

1:14:08.029 --> 1:14:10.031
Do it now
or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

1:14:12.689 --> 1:14:14.104
Good.

1:14:14.967 --> 1:14:16.452
Now put your hands
behind your head.

1:14:18.074 --> 1:14:19.351
No!

1:14:19.351 --> 1:14:20.939
Give up!

1:14:52.798 --> 1:14:54.766
I warned you.

1:15:28.869 --> 1:15:30.249
No.

1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:38.810
No.

1:15:40.743 --> 1:15:42.503
Please, no.

1:15:42.952 --> 1:15:44.022
No.

1:16:01.453 --> 1:16:02.454
No.

1:16:36.799 --> 1:16:38.076
Who's there?

1:16:38.076 --> 1:16:39.111
Detective Boyd.

1:16:50.985 --> 1:16:53.436
One white male
found dead on site.

1:16:53.436 --> 1:16:54.575
Shelby Farner.

1:16:58.855 --> 1:17:00.477
No trace of Randoku.

1:17:15.285 --> 1:17:16.666
<i>Detective Boyd.</i>

1:17:16.666 --> 1:17:18.357
This is Inspector Lavazzi.

1:17:18.357 --> 1:17:19.980
<i>Inspector Lavazzi.</i>

1:17:19.980 --> 1:17:22.016
I found something
that might be helpful.

1:17:22.016 --> 1:17:23.224
What?

1:17:23.224 --> 1:17:25.261
<i>Randoku was here
in Rome</i>

1:17:25.261 --> 1:17:27.988
<i>attending a lecture
from someone from your city.</i>

1:17:29.161 --> 1:17:31.992
A college professor
by the name of Mackles.

1:17:33.338 --> 1:17:36.203
All of this happened
nine months ago.

1:17:36.203 --> 1:17:38.964
<i>They also met several times
- after the lecture.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

1:17:38.964 --> 1:17:40.000
Right.

1:17:41.380 --> 1:17:42.761
Maybe this can
help you somehow.

1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:44.660
I appreciate the call.

1:18:17.209 --> 1:18:18.245
Aw, man.

1:18:19.384 --> 1:18:20.488
God damn it.

1:18:25.459 --> 1:18:26.460
All right.

1:18:29.152 --> 1:18:31.189
Detective?
- Mmm, yeah.

1:18:31.189 --> 1:18:33.536
Detective?
Are you okay?

1:18:35.503 --> 1:18:37.782
She was my partner.

1:18:37.782 --> 1:18:39.611
It's all right.
She's been transferred.

1:18:41.889 --> 1:18:43.063
What did you say?

1:18:43.063 --> 1:18:44.789
It's okay.
She's okay.

1:18:44.789 --> 1:18:47.515
I had her moved
- downstairs.
- No, no. What do you mean?

1:18:47.515 --> 1:18:50.208
It's okay.
I had her moved
downstairs, Detective.

1:18:53.349 --> 1:18:54.626
Oh, Jesus.

1:18:54.626 --> 1:18:56.248
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

1:18:56.248 --> 1:18:59.320
- Oh, thank you.
- You know, every once
in a while, there's a miracle.

1:19:02.082 --> 1:19:03.773
I guess so. Yeah.

1:19:03.773 --> 1:19:06.742
You know, a friend
of hers came by last night
and stayed for about an hour.

1:19:06.742 --> 1:19:07.984
And then I saw him leave.

1:19:11.401 --> 1:19:12.851
What do you mean?
What did he look like?

1:19:12.851 --> 1:19:15.474
Um, he was a tall,
greying black man.

1:19:15.474 --> 1:19:17.062
Probably about 70s.

1:19:17.062 --> 1:19:18.581
With very kind eyes.

1:19:19.789 --> 1:19:21.791
I think he prayed over her,
and then I saw him leave.

1:19:23.172 --> 1:19:24.725
What did he say?

1:19:24.725 --> 1:19:26.900
He just said
she was going
to be all right.

1:19:26.900 --> 1:19:29.316
And then he said a word
I didn't understand.

1:19:29.316 --> 1:19:30.524
Yeah, what was that?

1:19:30.524 --> 1:19:31.559
<i>Muti?</i>

1:19:33.389 --> 1:19:34.631
- I don't know.
- Thank you for
saving her, Doctor.

1:19:34.631 --> 1:19:36.841
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

1:19:36.841 --> 1:19:37.842
You bet.

1:20:06.491 --> 1:20:08.182
<i>Hello, you've reached
Dr. Mackles office.</i>

1:20:08.182 --> 1:20:11.323
<i>Dr. Mackles is on extended
leave until further notice.</i>

1:20:11.323 --> 1:20:12.531
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1:20:15.327 --> 1:20:16.328
Well played.

1:20:59.475 --> 1:21:01.235
You're a fucking
piece of work, Lucas.

1:21:04.238 --> 1:21:05.826
<i>You're fucking...</i> LUCAS: <i>We're not doing this.</i>

1:21:05.826 --> 1:21:07.932
<i>We're not doing this again?
We're not doing this again?</i>

1:21:07.932 --> 1:21:10.969
You know what
you're not gonna do it?
You fell asleep again!

1:21:10.969 --> 1:21:16.561
You know our daughter
has fucking seizures,
and you fell asleep!

1:21:16.561 --> 1:21:17.631
<i>What do I want?</i>

1:21:18.839 --> 1:21:19.875
<i>Fucking piece of...</i> LUCAS: <i>Come on.</i>

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:21.738
- Son of a bitch!
Come on, come on.

1:21:31.645 --> 1:21:32.749
I'm sorry.

1:21:32.749 --> 1:21:34.475
That's right,
- I'm fucking done!
- Go upstairs!

1:21:37.168 --> 1:21:41.241
<i>She was
the only thing in this
whole sick fucking world</i>

1:21:41.241 --> 1:21:44.830
<i>that was any good
and you took her away from me!</i>

1:21:55.255 --> 1:21:56.601
Deelie.

1:21:58.223 --> 1:21:59.293
Deelie!

1:22:02.124 --> 1:22:03.090
Deelie!

1:22:05.990 --> 1:22:07.577
I'm really sorry
for what I did.
