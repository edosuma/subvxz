Encoded by Deceit
@ YIFY Torrents.

02:29.729 --> 02:32.163
You seem as eager to meet
me on the battlefield...

02:32.164 --> 02:34.390
...as you once did in
the bedroom, Hippolyta.

02:34.391 --> 02:38.970
I only hope you prove more
skilled in this arena, Ares.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.575
You need not worry for me.

02:46.576 --> 02:48.473
This carnage feeds my soul.

02:48.948 --> 02:52.439
Every arrow shot and life
wasted strengthens me...

02:52.440 --> 02:56.611
...so that not even a woman scorned
will save mankind from my wrath.

03:02.295 --> 03:06.891
For you may be the queen of the
Amazons, but I am the God of war.

03:26.686 --> 03:30.486
You are most greedy on the
battlefield, Artemis.

03:31.991 --> 03:34.152
My sword is thirsty, Persephone.

03:34.153 --> 03:35.954
I intend she gets her fill.

04:03.456 --> 04:05.570
As a rock on the seashore
he standeth firm.

04:05.571 --> 04:07.615
The dashing of the waves
disturbeth him not.

04:07.616 --> 04:10.290
In danger, the courage of
his heart sustaineth him.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.895
And the steadiness of his
mind beareth him out.

04:12.896 --> 04:16.432
I assure you, Alexa, a sharp blade and
a strong arm will do more good...

04:16.433 --> 04:18.365
...than a quote from
some philosopher.

04:18.366 --> 04:20.870
I do not belong on this
killing field, sister.

04:20.870 --> 04:22.538
I am no warrior.

04:22.539 --> 04:24.137
That you are not.

04:24.138 --> 04:27.040
But if you cannot fight like an Amazon,
you will at least die like one.

04:34.187 --> 04:37.054
You truly are hopeless,
aren't you, little one?

04:51.704 --> 04:52.727
Persephone.

04:52.728 --> 04:55.081
She now wears her courage.

04:55.082 --> 04:57.366
Where is yours, Alexa?

05:07.186 --> 05:09.882
Listen to the song of
death Thrax plays.

05:10.857 --> 05:12.346
Is he not a virtuoso?

05:12.347 --> 05:16.256
I will forever be grateful to
you for this child you gave me.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.884
I gave you nothing.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.032
You forced him upon
me like a curse.

05:22.161 --> 05:24.633
Stay away from him, Hippolyta.
Stay away.

05:24.634 --> 05:27.603
He is your flesh and blood too.

06:05.478 --> 06:09.846
Allow me to reunite you
with your son in Tartarus.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.575
Yield, Hippolyta.

06:12.576 --> 06:14.582
Stay out of this, Zeus.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.104
You will spare my son's life.

06:17.105 --> 06:19.080
How dare you ask such a thing?

06:19.081 --> 06:20.986
Look on this battlefield...

06:20.987 --> 06:24.960
...stained red with the blood of my
sisters whom he enslaved for decades.

06:24.961 --> 06:27.656
Women who have long been
loyal servants to you.

06:27.657 --> 06:32.566
I am only carrying out the death sentence
he signed the day he betrayed me.

06:32.567 --> 06:35.537
Do not challenge me, child.

06:35.538 --> 06:37.142
My dear Hippolyta.

06:37.743 --> 06:39.824
Do not let my husband anger you.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.838
He can be a stubborn
fool sometimes.

06:42.982 --> 06:45.814
Even so, we must
respect his wishes.

06:45.815 --> 06:47.715
Ares will be allowed to live...

06:48.154 --> 06:50.802
...yet shall not go unpunished.

06:50.803 --> 06:53.382
You will keep him
as your prisoner.

06:56.862 --> 07:01.265
These bands will prevent him from drawing
upon the psychic energies of war...

07:01.266 --> 07:02.730
...that give him his power...

07:02.731 --> 07:05.392
...rendering him,
in effect, mortal.

07:05.393 --> 07:08.715
They can only be removed
by another God.

07:08.716 --> 07:11.968
But my people, Hera,
they have lost so much.

07:11.969 --> 07:15.738
Our men, our homes and now
our chance for retribution.

07:15.739 --> 07:20.181
Yes, but as I gave you the strength
to deliver yourselves from slavery...

07:20.182 --> 07:22.253
...I shall now give
you a new beginning.

07:22.254 --> 07:24.719
A new home on an
island paradise...

07:24.720 --> 07:29.418
<i>...where your people will be shielded
from the chaotic world of man,</i>

07:31.364 --> 07:34.925
<i>There, you will be protected
from the ravages of time...</i>

07:34.926 --> 07:37.534
<i>...and allowed to
create a utopia...</i>

07:37.535 --> 07:41.298
<i>...that you might reclaim
your purity of spirit,</i>

07:46.646 --> 07:50.879
<i>And then the time will come when
your ancient prayer for a child...</i>

07:50.880 --> 07:55.045
<i>...one not created through unholy
union, will finally be answered,</i>

09:00.052 --> 09:03.578
You know, Artemis, I found myself saying
a little prayer for you last night.

09:03.579 --> 09:06.156
Did you, Diana? How kind?

09:06.157 --> 09:08.485
Yes, I prayed that Apollo
would inspire you...

09:08.486 --> 09:12.995
...with a strategy that might end your
rather long string of defeats at my hand.

09:23.743 --> 09:25.802
Praise Apollo.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.607
Obviously I'm not
praying hard enough.

09:31.851 --> 09:34.080
If you were not the
queen's daughter.

09:34.081 --> 09:35.811
Well done, Diana.

09:35.812 --> 09:37.511
But be kind to Artemis.

09:37.512 --> 09:41.888
Believe it or not, there was a time when
she was the fiercest warrior among us.

09:41.889 --> 09:44.654
And still would be given the
chance in a real battle.

09:44.655 --> 09:46.808
Then forgive me, Artemis,
if I am grateful

09:46.809 --> 09:48.994
that you will never be
afforded that chance.

09:48.995 --> 09:52.832
If that is indeed true, Mother, then
what is the point of all this training?

09:52.833 --> 09:55.918
That is, other than to humble
Artemis from time to time.

09:55.919 --> 09:58.965
We train because we must
always remain vigilant, Diana.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.978
I once let my guard down
and paid a terrible price.

10:01.979 --> 10:03.137
But, my queen...

10:03.138 --> 10:07.012
...letting down our guard is
precisely what we must do.

10:07.013 --> 10:10.087
And now, before yet
another century passes...

10:10.088 --> 10:13.157
...is the time to reengage
ourselves with the old world.

10:13.158 --> 10:16.192
Even if only to add some new
material to our library.

10:16.193 --> 10:17.487
Perhaps Alexa's right.

10:17.488 --> 10:20.655
Is it not possible man's world
has changed for the better?

10:23.836 --> 10:26.066
Follow me, child.

10:33.179 --> 10:35.078
It is only within
this prison, Diana...

10:35.079 --> 10:39.013
...that you can glimpse the true darkness
that lurks in the hearts of all men.

10:51.764 --> 10:54.756
Ares, the God of war.

10:56.735 --> 10:57.792
Do not fear.

10:57.793 --> 11:00.335
She is right to be
scared, Hippolyta.

11:00.336 --> 11:03.270
You are a fool if you think
you can hold me forever.

11:03.271 --> 11:05.104
I am more than a God.

11:05.744 --> 11:07.540
I am a force of nature.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.340
You are but breath and shadow.

11:10.341 --> 11:14.247
This, Diana, is why we can never
reunite with the outside world.

11:14.248 --> 11:17.787
It is better if you can accept
the nature of man as it is.

11:17.788 --> 11:23.361
Wicked, disloyal and above
all, untrustworthy.

11:27.366 --> 11:30.597
So we ever decide what this
mission's pucker factor was?

11:30.598 --> 11:32.862
<i>Well, we're in the airspace
of an unfriendly...</i>

11:32.863 --> 11:36.063
<i>...who'd love the press that would
come with shooting Yankees,</i>

11:36.064 --> 11:39.939
I'd say we're dealing with a pucker
factor of eight. Maybe eight and a half.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.340
Pucker factor?

11:41.341 --> 11:45.074
<i>PF measures the severity of sphincter
constriction in times of peril,</i>

11:45.075 --> 11:46.240
Charming.

11:46.241 --> 11:50.445
Now, any further schooling you might need,
I'm happy to take you under my wing.

11:50.446 --> 11:51.714
Don't fall for it, rook.

11:51.715 --> 11:55.418
Zipper here is the kind of guy
mothers warn their daughters about.

11:58.931 --> 11:59.989
Bandit, 6 o'clock.

12:03.502 --> 12:07.734
You sure picked a hell of a
first mission, rook. Fangs up.

12:19.018 --> 12:22.818
There appears to be some
activity in the skies above us.

12:22.819 --> 12:24.922
It's strange, Artemis.

12:24.923 --> 12:27.523
This silver mirror
forged by Hephaestus...

12:27.524 --> 12:31.458
...has kept us hidden away from the
outside world for centuries now.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.144
And yet it's only when I
gaze through its frame...

12:34.145 --> 12:36.760
...that I feel any connection
to our past lives...

12:36.761 --> 12:40.895
...as if once again that world
is close enough to touch.

12:46.578 --> 12:49.775
For Gaea's sake, my queen,
have you lost your mind?

13:17.543 --> 13:22.037
<i>Hey, rook, it would be appreciated
if you could help me pick this tail,</i>

13:23.582 --> 13:25.483
<i>Rook, you copy?</i>

13:25.484 --> 13:27.317
<i>Do you copy?</i>

13:32.358 --> 13:33.825
<i>Damn it,</i>

13:34.226 --> 13:36.353
<i>PF just hit 10,</i>

13:42.201 --> 13:45.796
Perhaps you'd be better served by
a less restless mare, Princess.

13:45.797 --> 13:47.802
She'll be fine once I
run it out of her.

13:47.803 --> 13:50.463
She's just been cooped up
in the stable too long.

13:50.464 --> 13:55.101
I know just how you feel. We comb
you. We feed you till you're full.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.859
Give you everything you
could possibly need,

13:57.860 --> 14:00.650
and yet all you want is
to run free, isn't it?

14:00.651 --> 14:02.150
Off to explore?

14:02.151 --> 14:05.222
I doubt there's an inch of this
island left for me to explore.

14:05.223 --> 14:06.380
Care to join me?

14:06.381 --> 14:09.789
Thank you but you know I prefer
the excitement of a good book.

14:26.612 --> 14:28.909
<i>Two bandits on your tail,
Slick, I'll intercept him,</i>

14:28.910 --> 14:33.381
<i>Negative on the intercept, trooper, You
got your own plane pal to deal with,</i>

15:30.742 --> 15:31.902
<i>Slick!</i>

15:55.434 --> 15:56.924
<i>You're dead gone,</i>

16:04.510 --> 16:06.477
Radio command, this is
Zipper, do you read?

16:06.478 --> 16:09.546
I'm experiencing catastrophic
engine failure, punching out.

16:12.151 --> 16:13.550
Not good.

16:29.368 --> 16:32.929
What the...? Where did the
landing strip come from?

17:13.444 --> 17:14.776
Whew.

17:49.615 --> 17:51.514
Oh, man.

17:51.515 --> 17:54.413
This is too good to be true.

17:55.153 --> 17:57.178
And it is.

18:10.802 --> 18:13.361
Is it true, Artemis?
A man on the island?

18:13.362 --> 18:16.372
Go home, Princess.
That is an order.

18:16.373 --> 18:18.999
I'll take it under advisement.

18:47.639 --> 18:51.268
- An Angel.
- Surrender. You cannot escape.

18:51.269 --> 18:53.502
Oh, I don't know
about that, Angel.

18:53.503 --> 18:56.978
I've made a hobby out of
fleeing chasing women.

19:14.966 --> 19:17.560
Wow... ...I think I like you.

19:36.955 --> 19:40.158
Wow, haven't had this
dream since I was 13.

19:40.159 --> 19:43.328
- Aah. - You will speak
only when spoken to.

19:43.329 --> 19:44.952
That's enough, Artemis.

19:46.098 --> 19:48.062
Welcome to Themyscira.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.958
We are the Amazons.

19:49.959 --> 19:53.502
We live simple lives, and we
wish to keep it that way.

19:53.503 --> 19:56.266
There are a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

19:56.267 --> 19:59.137
Sorry, ma'am,
soldiers don't talk.

19:59.138 --> 20:01.870
Hey, I'm into the Kinky stuff
too, but if you think...

20:01.871 --> 20:03.947
...that's gonna make
me more cooperative...

20:03.948 --> 20:05.572
Identify yourself.

20:06.852 --> 20:10.720
United States Air Force. Colonel
Steven Rockwell Trevor.

20:11.590 --> 20:15.526
This lasso was designed to bypass
the untrustworthy nature of man.

20:15.527 --> 20:17.957
You cannot resist its powers.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.994
What interest does your
government have in our island?

20:20.995 --> 20:23.996
My government is unaware of
the existence of your island.

20:23.997 --> 20:26.161
I'm only here because
my plane was damaged.

20:27.566 --> 20:29.297
I don't have to put
up with this crap.

20:30.308 --> 20:33.709
We are unfamiliar with
this particular idiom.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.312
What does crap mean?

20:36.214 --> 20:37.977
No, forget I even said it.

20:39.951 --> 20:41.680
It's another word for excrement.

20:41.681 --> 20:43.215
You happy now, lady?

20:43.216 --> 20:44.680
What did he say?

20:44.681 --> 20:46.755
- Oh, my goodness.
- I can't believe this.

20:46.756 --> 20:48.358
What did he say?

20:48.359 --> 20:51.359
See, my child? Is it not
as I've always said?

20:51.360 --> 20:54.290
Here the true nature
of man is laid bare.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.900
What other depraved thoughts
must you be thinking?

20:58.103 --> 21:00.071
God, your daughter's
got a nice rack.

21:03.275 --> 21:06.005
Shall I kill him now, my queen?

21:09.014 --> 21:11.573
This pilot poses no
threat to our people.

21:11.574 --> 21:15.880
Therefore, it is our duty to see him
safely returned to the outside world.

21:15.881 --> 21:18.387
I wanna be the one to
take him back, Mother.

21:18.388 --> 21:19.546
Seconded.

21:19.547 --> 21:24.058
You do not have the experience
necessary to lead such an expedition.

21:24.059 --> 21:25.526
As in ancient times...

21:25.527 --> 21:29.064
...a contest will determine our
emissary to the outside world.

21:29.065 --> 21:32.534
Artemis, make the arrangements.

21:35.740 --> 21:36.933
This is not fair, Mother.

21:36.934 --> 21:40.653
I will always lack necessary experience
unless given the opportunity.

21:40.654 --> 21:44.338
Diana, you may resent my decisions
but there are evils in this world...

21:44.339 --> 21:48.749
...that I, as a mother, am
compelled to protect you against.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.878
I am a woman now. I no
longer need your protection.

21:51.879 --> 21:54.855
If the Princess will not be
participating in the contest...

21:54.856 --> 21:57.393
...perhaps she can
join me on guard duty.

21:57.394 --> 22:00.657
It appears you are
going to be busy.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.690
What?

22:14.813 --> 22:18.510
Alexa, are you covering
Persephone's guard duty?

22:18.511 --> 22:20.139
I am covering yours.

22:20.140 --> 22:22.616
Now, go, the contest
will begin shortly.

22:22.617 --> 22:24.152
I appreciate the gesture...

22:24.153 --> 22:27.951
...but you know that's the last place my
mother will allow me to show my face.

22:27.952 --> 22:31.153
Then perhaps you should hide
it under a combat helmet.

22:35.267 --> 22:37.462
You are my heart, sister.

22:42.173 --> 22:43.663
Where is the Princess?

22:45.610 --> 22:49.647
Why does she not understand her
mother knows what is best for her?

22:49.648 --> 22:53.617
The heart wants what the heart wants,
even that which is worst for it.

23:00.025 --> 23:03.028
This contest will determine
the most capable among you...

23:03.029 --> 23:06.494
...to be our emissary
to the outside world.

23:07.399 --> 23:08.764
Fight with honor.

23:49.941 --> 23:52.205
So the queen's kid, you
know, the hot Chick?

23:52.206 --> 23:54.277
Princess Diana.

23:54.278 --> 23:56.413
Yeah, her. So, what's her deal?

23:56.414 --> 23:59.880
Her deal is that I will
personally castrate you...

23:59.881 --> 24:02.714
...if you come within
five yards of her.

24:31.249 --> 24:35.549
Perhaps the arrival of this man will
bring forth a new Era for the Amazons.

24:35.550 --> 24:39.282
And perhaps it will only bring
a return to darker times.

24:39.283 --> 24:41.482
That is fear talking, sister.

24:41.483 --> 24:44.720
There's a quote in which I find
the courage to face the unknown.

24:44.721 --> 24:47.490
As a rock on the seashore,
he standeth firm.

24:47.491 --> 24:50.430
"And the dashing of the
waves disturbeth him not."

24:50.431 --> 24:51.592
In the instant...

24:54.939 --> 24:56.701
Yes, I know the quote well.

24:56.702 --> 24:59.275
It has aided me much
in recent days.

24:59.276 --> 25:01.071
Shall I finish it?

25:01.072 --> 25:03.975
In the instant of danger,
the courage of his heart...

25:03.976 --> 25:07.710
...sustaineth him and the steadiness
of his mind beareth him out.

25:09.087 --> 25:11.055
Forgive me.

25:12.657 --> 25:14.386
It's as you said.

25:15.894 --> 25:18.055
The heart wants what
the heart wants...

25:19.564 --> 25:22.863
...even that which
is worst for it.

25:34.679 --> 25:39.810
A century's long courtship
finally culminated in a kiss.

25:40.351 --> 25:43.809
I find my Joy is only tempered
by the fact that Diana lives.

25:44.289 --> 25:47.850
Still, our destruction
has worked. Come.

25:58.336 --> 26:00.326
We have a tie which
must be broken.

26:00.327 --> 26:03.099
She who is left standing
after this final event...

26:03.100 --> 26:04.367
...will be the Victor.

26:04.368 --> 26:06.409
Left standing?

26:44.682 --> 26:47.013
You fought with honor
and intelligence.

26:47.014 --> 26:51.121
The gods go with you with the
gifts I'm about to bestow.

26:51.122 --> 26:52.813
As is the custom...

26:52.814 --> 26:55.789
...our emissary will don the
colors of the foreign nation...

26:55.790 --> 26:59.454
...as a sign of
respect and peace.

27:00.765 --> 27:02.197
Amazon bracelets...

27:02.198 --> 27:05.962
...formed from shards of Zeus'
shield by Hephaestus himself.

27:05.963 --> 27:09.266
Finally, the Lasso of Truth...

27:09.267 --> 27:12.518
...bequeathed to us by
the goddess Hestia...

27:12.519 --> 27:15.736
...sent here by Eros
from Mount Olympus.

27:15.737 --> 27:17.926
Now reveal yourself, warrior...

27:17.927 --> 27:20.048
...so that we may
fully honor you.

27:36.334 --> 27:38.962
I have no doubt you
will serve us well...

27:39.571 --> 27:41.300
...my daughter.

27:42.674 --> 27:44.938
Alexa's dead.

27:50.381 --> 27:51.574
Ares has escaped.

27:51.575 --> 27:55.412
My sister has failed in her
duties to the Amazons.

27:56.020 --> 27:58.420
It is Persephone
who has failed us.

28:01.259 --> 28:04.456
It seems, daughter, your journey
will have a second purpose.

28:43.635 --> 28:46.432
- I am ready, Mother.
- Then go now.

28:46.433 --> 28:50.836
Follow the path of misery, of death and
destruction and you will find Ares.

28:50.837 --> 28:53.136
May Gaea be with you, Diana.

28:53.137 --> 28:54.835
All of Themyscira...

28:54.836 --> 28:57.811
...all of the world
depends on you.

29:06.624 --> 29:10.150
- We should not have let her go. - I
don't see how we could've stopped her.

29:10.151 --> 29:13.389
I could have shot her in the leg.
Not near an artery, of course.

29:13.390 --> 29:17.058
You are the soul of
thoughtfulness, Artemis.

29:26.511 --> 29:28.328
Welcome to New York, Angel.

29:28.329 --> 29:30.077
I think you're gonna like it.

29:42.193 --> 29:43.750
Hey, wait a minute.

29:43.751 --> 29:47.261
What is going...? Look at
that lady. What is it...?

29:56.931 --> 29:59.439
You can't catch me. Children.

29:59.440 --> 30:03.774
Steve, I've never seen
children before. I'm...

30:12.123 --> 30:13.555
What's wrong, little one?

30:13.556 --> 30:16.489
They won't let me play
pirates with them.

30:16.490 --> 30:17.650
And why not?

30:17.651 --> 30:21.287
Because I'm the girl, and
they need someone to save.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.823
It's okay.

30:23.824 --> 30:26.402
I don't even know
how to sword fight.

30:26.403 --> 30:27.560
Take that.

30:27.561 --> 30:28.966
Neither do they.

30:28.967 --> 30:32.132
In battle, they'd be
slaughtered instantly.

30:33.611 --> 30:36.671
Would you like me to teach
you how to sword fight?

30:41.419 --> 30:44.319
They're using the horizontal cut,
but in close like they are...

30:44.320 --> 30:47.959
...the thrust is a better move as it's
more likely to 'cause real injury...

30:47.960 --> 30:50.390
...and less likely to be
blocked by your opponent.

30:50.391 --> 30:53.156
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh.

30:53.157 --> 30:55.891
Now go. Unleash hell.

30:59.137 --> 31:03.130
That was sweet. Teaching her to
disembowel her playmates like that.

31:03.408 --> 31:06.343
Now we part ways, Steve Trevor.
I have work to do.

31:06.344 --> 31:08.467
Hold on, maybe I can help.

31:08.468 --> 31:11.740
My job allows me access to
sophisticated surveillance technology.

31:11.741 --> 31:13.077
It might help your search.

31:15.553 --> 31:17.817
I will see what your
technology has to offer.

31:18.523 --> 31:21.117
- What is she wearing?
- Wow.

31:22.693 --> 31:27.687
First, let's get you into something that
won't get me arrested for solicitation.

31:41.612 --> 31:43.773
Stevie.

31:44.382 --> 31:45.905
Everyone said you were dead.

31:45.906 --> 31:49.645
I even took a long lunch to buy this
cute little number for your funeral.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.617
Now, when am I gonna
get to wear it?

31:51.618 --> 31:53.847
I hear General Cookmeyer's
health is failing.

31:53.848 --> 31:58.519
Etta Candy, this is Diana. She's part
of the team that, uh, rescued me.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.494
Pleasure.

32:00.998 --> 32:03.523
I'm so glad you're here, Stevie.

32:04.669 --> 32:07.695
Would you mind moving this
heavy table for little old me?

32:07.696 --> 32:11.001
It's holding my
favorite pen hostage.

32:11.002 --> 32:14.201
I'm sorry, Etta Candy, but
what's wrong with you?

32:14.202 --> 32:15.504
Excuse me?

32:15.505 --> 32:19.810
You appear to be strong and in good health,
yet you can't move that table by yourself.

32:19.811 --> 32:22.453
I was wondering if there was
something wrong with you.

32:22.454 --> 32:24.748
Well, no one's complained yet.

32:31.496 --> 32:33.191
Is this what you
were looking for?

32:34.799 --> 32:37.700
We have some work to
do on the computers.

32:38.369 --> 32:40.496
I'll see you later, Etta.

32:42.907 --> 32:44.238
Hmph.

32:45.209 --> 32:46.266
Remarkable.

32:46.267 --> 32:48.035
The advanced brainwashing...

32:48.036 --> 32:51.078
...that has been perpetuated upon
the females of your culture.

32:51.079 --> 32:55.083
Raised from birth to believe they're not
strong enough to compete with the boys.

32:55.084 --> 32:58.416
And then as adults, taught to
trade on their very femininity.

32:58.417 --> 33:01.715
How about we stay focused on
that other social evil for now?

33:01.716 --> 33:03.792
God of war, remember?

33:03.793 --> 33:07.556
Tell me, what exactly are we
up against with this guy?

33:07.798 --> 33:10.562
Imagine a God whose sole mission
is to propagate terror...

33:10.563 --> 33:13.367
...to incite eternal war and
fan the flames of hate.

33:13.368 --> 33:16.103
A God who won't stop until
the Earth's populous...

33:16.104 --> 33:21.075
...Amazon and outsider alike, lies
murdered in a battlefield grave.

33:21.646 --> 33:23.203
You smell good.

33:23.204 --> 33:25.849
- Must you flirt?
- It's only natural.

33:25.850 --> 33:27.951
Suppress it.

33:28.853 --> 33:32.083
Now, this is interesting. Right
around the time of his escape...

33:32.084 --> 33:35.521
...the number of violent incidents
increased dramatically in the area.

33:35.522 --> 33:38.754
A car bomb in Turkey, a
workplace shooting in Greece...

33:38.755 --> 33:40.761
...a farmer kills his
family in Crete.

33:41.465 --> 33:44.468
Proximity to Ares literally
inspires acts of rage...

33:44.469 --> 33:46.695
...in those gripped
by fear and anger.

33:46.696 --> 33:48.326
This might be the break we need.

33:48.327 --> 33:52.340
Eventually a pattern will form that will
allow us to pinpoint his exact location.

33:52.341 --> 33:54.238
So for now, we wait.

33:54.239 --> 33:58.242
You know, since this could be the last
time you get to see the outside world...

33:58.243 --> 34:02.211
...maybe you should take in sights before
you return to Chastity Belt Island.

34:02.212 --> 34:03.649
Themyscira.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.448
What did you have in mind?

34:10.255 --> 34:11.621
I hope this is okay.

34:11.621 --> 34:15.322
So tell me, what do you think about
man in the outside world so far?

34:15.322 --> 34:16.955
I mean, I'm not so bad, am I?

34:16.956 --> 34:20.625
So now it's my turn to be
interrogated? Well, I'll never tell.

34:20.626 --> 34:25.299
You will, because while the Amazons
have the truth lasso, I've got Tequila.

34:29.679 --> 34:30.976
A toast...

34:31.882 --> 34:34.350
...to different cultures
finding common ground.

34:35.686 --> 34:38.587
A most Noble endeavor.

34:38.588 --> 34:41.420
That's me, Angel. Noble.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.656
Your mother and Ares? Really?

34:46.657 --> 34:49.822
The whole God of war thing
didn't raise any red flags?

34:51.402 --> 34:53.070
I guess it's not surprising.

34:53.071 --> 34:54.670
Women always go for the bad boy.

34:54.670 --> 34:57.238
If the God of dependability
was trying to get her...

34:57.239 --> 35:01.208
...she'd be like, "You're really sweet,
but I just think of you as a friend."

35:01.209 --> 35:04.940
God of war hits on her, it's
all, "Whoo. You're cute."

35:04.941 --> 35:06.105
You think that's bad?

35:06.106 --> 35:09.185
Zeus seduced one of my mom's
friends by turning into a swan.

35:09.787 --> 35:12.517
A swan. True story.

35:13.791 --> 35:17.158
As long as I can remember, I've
had dreams of being the one...

35:17.159 --> 35:20.059
...who reunited Themyscira
with the outside world.

35:20.060 --> 35:21.857
Of being that bridge.

35:21.858 --> 35:25.434
It just feels like so much
depends on me right now.

35:25.903 --> 35:28.806
Uh-huh. Right, I get that.
Totally.

35:28.807 --> 35:31.675
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

35:31.676 --> 35:33.276
Yeah?

35:34.312 --> 35:38.248
Which is why the concept of hubris is
such a staple of the Greek tragedies.

35:38.249 --> 35:40.501
<i>Ever read Oedipus Rex?</i>

35:40.502 --> 35:42.685
Pretty messed up, huh?

35:56.267 --> 35:58.497
God, you're pretty.

35:59.837 --> 36:00.587
Ow.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.301
Men.

36:07.211 --> 36:10.111
Hey, hey, what did I do?

36:10.112 --> 36:11.747
It's all true, isn't it, Steve?

36:11.748 --> 36:14.748
Everything my mother warned
me about man's world is true.

36:14.749 --> 36:16.852
She even told me you'd
try to seduce me...

36:16.853 --> 36:19.469
...and I, like a fool,
told her, "For now,

36:19.470 --> 36:22.118
let us only expect the
best from the pilot."

36:22.119 --> 36:24.317
You tried to get me drunk.

36:24.318 --> 36:27.123
As if you could outdrink an
Amazon, you lightweight.

36:27.124 --> 36:28.594
Oh, crap.

36:28.595 --> 36:30.927
Yes, I knew exactly what
you were trying to do.

36:30.928 --> 36:32.967
And don't use that
language around me.

36:32.968 --> 36:34.400
Evening, folks.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.665
Sorry to bother you, but we're
collecting stupidity fines.

36:37.666 --> 36:41.539
Well, bring your date into a
neighborhood this dangerous this late?

36:41.540 --> 36:44.169
Pretty fricking stupid.

36:44.170 --> 36:45.939
Is this man robbing us, Steve?

36:45.940 --> 36:50.349
Here, there's a gift certificate to
the Blue Crab in there too. Enjoy.

36:50.350 --> 36:51.512
Give him nothing.

36:52.656 --> 36:55.792
- The wallet. - No, we're
going to hold on to that.

36:55.793 --> 36:58.859
But there is something I
want from you. An apology.

36:58.860 --> 37:02.362
For contributing to my present
disillusionment with men in general.

37:03.033 --> 37:05.648
Can you believe
this crazy Chick?

37:05.649 --> 37:08.230
I'm not gonna ask again.
The wallet.

37:08.231 --> 37:10.165
Diana, he's got a gun.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.030
Someone could get hurt.

37:12.031 --> 37:14.370
Maybe I want someone
to get hurt.

37:35.766 --> 37:39.528
- Well? - Uh, uh... I'm sorry.

37:39.529 --> 37:41.193
Apology accepted.

37:45.476 --> 37:46.670
That was kind of hot.

37:48.779 --> 37:50.872
I got it this time.

37:53.284 --> 37:54.615
Buddy, go home...

37:59.423 --> 38:01.413
An agent of Ares, I presume.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.753
I don't think he's from
the Lower East Side.

38:04.462 --> 38:06.986
I am Deimos.

38:06.987 --> 38:11.746
I was sent to kill the Amazon
who returned the pilot.

38:11.747 --> 38:16.438
Ares will be most pleased when
I bring back your remains.

40:14.158 --> 40:16.888
Save your energy. You're not
going to break the lasso.

40:16.889 --> 40:19.051
So wanna tell me where Ares is?

40:19.052 --> 40:22.823
No, no, I will not
betray my master.

40:22.824 --> 40:26.868
Trust me, buddy, you don't have a choice.
Might as well answer the question.

40:26.869 --> 40:29.802
I answer only to Ares.

40:29.803 --> 40:32.238
- Aah!
- No.

40:39.617 --> 40:42.347
- What's this?
- The symbol of Tartarus.

40:42.348 --> 40:44.886
The Greek underworld.

40:57.167 --> 41:00.500
Oh, man. She was just
like a gift from the God.

41:01.933 --> 41:04.904
All the right reasons.

41:05.676 --> 41:07.666
The cult of Ares...

41:07.667 --> 41:09.937
...they existed in
ancient times...

41:09.938 --> 41:13.208
...and it seems they've been
waiting patiently for his return.

41:17.888 --> 41:20.288
- All right, see you later.
- So long.

41:20.289 --> 41:21.975
So, what happens after this?

41:21.976 --> 41:23.750
After you take down Ares?

41:23.751 --> 41:25.338
I return to Themyscira...

41:25.339 --> 41:26.857
...for good, I suppose.

41:36.540 --> 41:39.634
What about all that stuff about
bringing our two worlds together?

41:39.635 --> 41:42.041
Dreams of a naive girl.

42:21.518 --> 42:24.918
Soon, my love, these bands
will be but a memory...

42:24.919 --> 42:28.323
...and you will be free again
to summon the dark army...

42:28.324 --> 42:31.659
...that will allow us to rule
over this world together.

42:32.096 --> 42:35.088
You must thank your uncle for
agreeing to make this all possible.

42:35.733 --> 42:37.495
My uncle has agreed to nothing.

42:37.496 --> 42:41.297
In fact, I'd be quite surprised if
that miserable fool helps us at all.

42:41.298 --> 42:44.020
But there is no one
else to turn to.

42:44.021 --> 42:46.675
What if he does not
remove the bands?

42:47.111 --> 42:49.510
I can be very persuasive
when I need to be.

42:49.511 --> 42:53.446
I convinced you to turn your
back on your people, didn't I?

43:05.796 --> 43:08.263
Holy crap.

43:08.264 --> 43:10.991
Get over it. What's
he waiting for?

43:10.992 --> 43:12.192
The gates are sealed.

43:12.193 --> 43:15.200
He planned his escape to
coincide with the Blood Moon...

43:15.201 --> 43:18.140
...the one night of the year
the gates can be opened.

43:18.709 --> 43:23.373
But to do that, a sacrifice
must be made to Hades.

43:24.181 --> 43:27.548
Now, Persephone, I must call
upon your aid once again.

43:27.549 --> 43:30.084
How is it I can serve you?

43:31.321 --> 43:34.347
Your dagger, please.

43:36.293 --> 43:38.591
Of course, my King.

43:45.469 --> 43:47.027
Hey, wait.

43:58.215 --> 44:00.445
It is time.

44:01.385 --> 44:03.376
No, no, please, no.

44:14.131 --> 44:15.961
It's over, Ares.

44:15.962 --> 44:17.963
I'm taking you back
to Themyscira.

44:17.964 --> 44:22.469
On the bright side, you'll have
the company of a new cellmate.

44:23.273 --> 44:27.437
Surely you don't think a God can
be so easily defeated, do you?

44:37.788 --> 44:39.119
It's already done.

45:03.977 --> 45:06.672
Whatever happens, stop Ares
from opening the gates.

45:07.874 --> 45:10.747
No problem, Angel.
Leave it to me.

46:10.814 --> 46:11.534
Diana!

47:48.412 --> 47:50.642
God help us all.

48:03.693 --> 48:06.821
Easy, Cerberus. You
remember me, don't you?

48:06.822 --> 48:09.625
I'm here to see your master.

48:16.106 --> 48:18.631
Fine. She can stay here.

48:42.199 --> 48:43.460
You're early, nephew.

48:43.461 --> 48:46.830
Not that I don't Cherish your
company, my dear uncle...

48:46.831 --> 48:49.404
...but I'm afraid I'm
only visiting today.

48:50.674 --> 48:53.543
- You are here for a favor.
- I am.

48:53.544 --> 48:56.344
Perhaps then you can
enlighten me...

48:56.345 --> 48:59.106
...as to why you think I
would remove your bands.

48:59.107 --> 49:03.082
Is it because I've longed for a
return of your power-crazed ways?

49:03.083 --> 49:05.687
Or maybe, I wish to
see you act again...

49:05.688 --> 49:08.789
...without regard for your
divine brothers and sisters.

49:08.790 --> 49:11.856
Or is it simply because I
am so easily manipulated...

49:11.857 --> 49:14.793
...and like a dog,
will obey any command?

49:14.794 --> 49:17.057
It is simplicity itself.

49:17.058 --> 49:20.726
Once these bands are removed, I
will wage a war against humanity...

49:20.727 --> 49:23.396
...the likes of which this
world has never seen.

49:23.397 --> 49:25.598
Its populace will
choke on death.

49:25.599 --> 49:28.869
And you will be flooded with
more servants to glorify you...

49:28.870 --> 49:31.537
...than you will possibly
know what to do with.

49:33.517 --> 49:36.577
Very well. I will
accommodate your request.

49:36.578 --> 49:37.981
But I must confess.

49:37.982 --> 49:40.320
Upon your escape
from Themyscira...

49:40.321 --> 49:42.590
...your father came to me.
He asked...

49:42.591 --> 49:45.784
- Nay, begged me not
to help you. - Did he?

49:45.785 --> 49:48.991
Among his fears was that
your revitalized presence...

49:48.992 --> 49:52.128
...might threaten the delicate
power balance on Olympus.

49:52.129 --> 49:56.363
I'm not surprised that he who sanctioned
his own son's unjust bondage...

49:56.364 --> 49:58.667
...would put politics
above family.

49:58.668 --> 50:01.139
Excuse me one moment. Slave!

50:01.140 --> 50:06.408
That a father would treat his own son
in such a way fills me with sadness.

50:08.251 --> 50:09.775
Thrax, my son.

50:16.526 --> 50:18.356
Is everything all
right, dear nephew?

50:18.357 --> 50:20.894
The blood seems to have
rushed from your face.

50:21.965 --> 50:23.956
Yes. Of course.

50:24.401 --> 50:26.699
Where are my manners?

50:26.937 --> 50:31.340
Don't just stand there, you
pathetic twit. Attend to our guest.

50:31.341 --> 50:32.056
No.

50:38.848 --> 50:41.680
No further hospitality on
your part is required.

50:41.681 --> 50:45.480
You've been a most
magnanimous host.

50:45.481 --> 50:48.021
And you've waited too
long for this moment.

50:48.022 --> 50:50.149
Let's not extend
it another second.

50:52.495 --> 50:57.523
I shall never be able to repay
your gesture, dear uncle.

50:57.524 --> 51:00.158
And you will never need to.

51:01.204 --> 51:03.671
Like you, I Cherish family.

51:03.672 --> 51:06.069
So to assist you in this way...

51:06.070 --> 51:10.111
...well, it brings me
unconscionable amounts of Joy.

51:39.576 --> 51:40.633
Easy.

51:40.634 --> 51:44.507
You're lucky to be alive, so just
conserve your energy and rest.

51:44.508 --> 51:47.742
Did you...? Did you stop Ares?

51:49.619 --> 51:52.110
No, I didn't.

51:52.355 --> 51:54.357
- I couldn't.
- What?

51:54.358 --> 51:55.752
Why not?

51:55.753 --> 51:58.154
- I had to save you.
- Ow.

51:58.155 --> 52:01.794
I didn't need you to save me.
I needed you to stop Ares.

52:01.795 --> 52:05.364
Hey, if it weren't for me, you
wouldn't be here right now.

52:05.365 --> 52:09.061
I'm an Amazon, Steve. We're prepared
from birth to give our lives in battle.

52:09.062 --> 52:11.935
I knew what the consequences
were going in to this mission.

52:11.936 --> 52:14.441
You would have acted
differently, if I were a man.

52:14.442 --> 52:16.840
Oh, playing the card
again, are you?

52:16.841 --> 52:19.003
You know what? I've had
just about enough...

52:19.004 --> 52:21.776
...of listening to you go on
about how terrible men are.

52:21.777 --> 52:23.680
Does the truth hurt, Steve?

52:23.681 --> 52:26.980
News flash: The Amazons
ain't so perfect either.

52:26.981 --> 52:30.456
You act brave, but cutting yourselves
off from the world was cowardly.

52:30.457 --> 52:32.423
Not to mention stupid.

52:32.424 --> 52:35.894
Like less communication between men
and women is what the world needed.

52:35.895 --> 52:37.862
- How dare you?
- No! I'm not done.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.502
You met your first man,
what, like 15 minutes ago.

52:40.503 --> 52:42.536
And you think you have
us all figured out.

52:42.537 --> 52:45.004
Well, I'm sorry, but not
everything a man does...

52:45.005 --> 52:47.108
...is to further some
misogynistic agenda.

52:47.109 --> 52:49.802
We don't hold doors open or
pull out chairs for women...

52:49.803 --> 52:51.810
...because we're trying
to keep you down.

52:51.811 --> 52:55.212
I didn't save you because I thought
you were some damsel in distress.

52:55.213 --> 52:57.478
I saved you because...

52:57.479 --> 53:00.144
Because I care about you, Diana.

53:00.145 --> 53:04.760
And I'm not gonna abandon a
friend in need, man or woman.

53:08.164 --> 53:10.631
You should have saved the
world instead of me.

53:10.632 --> 53:14.566
Maybe I figured the world's not
worth saving if you're not in it.

53:21.745 --> 53:25.306
Ow! You crazy Amazonian
dragon lady.

53:26.049 --> 53:28.108
There's work to be done.

53:28.485 --> 53:31.852
By the way, you're starting
to sound like a woman.

53:34.290 --> 53:36.655
You've waited patiently,
my friends...

53:36.656 --> 53:41.490
...but the time has come once again
to spread my gospel of death.

53:41.491 --> 53:45.533
Now, let the natural state
of mistrust and betrayal...

53:45.534 --> 53:48.295
...run through the
soul of every man...

53:48.296 --> 53:55.035
...until I may walk across the Earth
on the backs of 5 billion corpses.

54:19.602 --> 54:22.070
Sorry I reacted the way
I did at the hospital.

54:22.672 --> 54:24.502
I'm sorry too.
Since we've met...

54:24.503 --> 54:28.542
...I don't think I've done the best job
of representing the masculine ideal.

54:28.543 --> 54:31.340
The truth is, I'm
really not such a pig.

54:32.482 --> 54:35.507
No, that's not the truth.
I am a pig.

54:35.508 --> 54:38.312
A womanizer. Been one
for a long time now.

54:38.313 --> 54:41.218
Sometimes I think it's all
because I don't wanna be hurt.

54:41.219 --> 54:42.414
Well, not again.

54:42.415 --> 54:45.322
This macho bravado,
it's all a facade.

54:45.323 --> 54:48.192
Wait, why am I telling you this?

54:50.200 --> 54:53.636
God, I hope you Amazons can't
mass produce this thing.

55:17.422 --> 55:19.623
They're messing with Lincoln.

55:19.624 --> 55:21.756
Nobody messes with Lincoln.

55:26.402 --> 55:29.894
Mr. President, we still don't know what
those things on our front lawn are.

55:29.895 --> 55:31.938
Every government we
have relations with...

55:31.939 --> 55:34.702
...has called to assure us
they aren't behind this.

55:34.703 --> 55:37.438
Well, someone has
to pay for this.

55:44.153 --> 55:48.089
Shall we? Mother tells me
you're a terrific dancer.

55:50.123 --> 55:53.094
Darn. Apparently someone
wants to cut in.

55:53.095 --> 55:56.031
You're not going to
conquer man, Ares.

55:56.032 --> 55:58.962
The Amazons will never let you.

55:58.963 --> 56:02.069
Now, who said I was
trying to conquer man?

56:02.070 --> 56:05.355
War is only the vehicle that
allows my soul to feed...

56:05.356 --> 56:08.571
...on the psychic energy
of fear, discord and hate.

56:08.572 --> 56:14.445
And already this modern world has given
me the kind of power I've never known.

56:14.446 --> 56:17.485
Power that will allow me
to conquer not man...

56:17.486 --> 56:20.122
...but the very gods of Olympus.

56:20.123 --> 56:21.347
Now, hold still.

56:21.348 --> 56:25.893
I wish to repay the kindness
your mother once showed my son.

56:46.950 --> 56:48.940
I must confess, my queen.

56:48.941 --> 56:51.449
It feels like the
first day of school.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.317
And yet you could not find
a bigger sword, Artemis?

56:54.318 --> 56:57.017
Sword? This is but my dagger.

56:57.994 --> 57:00.018
Hippolyta.

57:00.019 --> 57:02.460
Tear them apart.

57:24.687 --> 57:28.248
Looks like we'll have
that dance after all.

57:36.032 --> 57:37.328
Sir, we have intelligence...

57:37.329 --> 57:40.434
...that an island has appeared out
of nowhere in the Aegean Sea.

57:40.435 --> 57:43.970
If we're dealing with mystical forces,
this could be where they're from.

57:43.971 --> 57:47.572
Our military advisers are suggesting
we strike, and strike hard...

57:47.573 --> 57:51.105
...before they have a chance to
unleash who knows what else on us.

57:52.081 --> 57:53.275
Do it.

58:07.096 --> 58:10.360
How do you expect to defeat Zeus,
if you can't even beat a girl?

58:10.361 --> 58:13.900
You're optimistic, if you think I've
reached the height of my powers.

58:13.901 --> 58:15.560
You see, since I've been gone...

58:15.561 --> 58:19.401
...man has created a weapon of
such awesome destructive force...

58:19.402 --> 58:22.271
...that their use of only
one of these weapons...

58:22.272 --> 58:27.144
...feeds me with the psychic
energy of a thousand wars.

58:39.796 --> 58:41.593
Oh, crap.

59:17.166 --> 59:21.432
How will you stop me now that my
powers rival that of any God?

59:23.005 --> 59:25.132
I am as strong as Hercules.

59:28.211 --> 59:30.771
As fast as Hermes.

59:35.785 --> 59:40.346
And now, like Hades, I wield
dominion over the dead...

59:40.347 --> 59:44.994
...which allows me to unleash my
own worst curse upon your people.

59:44.995 --> 59:50.896
Amazon dead, I command you
to come to your Lord.

01:00:01.878 --> 01:00:04.142
Slaughter your sisters.

01:00:41.217 --> 01:00:45.153
Alexa, you bring yet more
disgrace to our family.

01:00:45.154 --> 01:00:47.950
This time I will ensure
that you stay dead.

01:00:57.533 --> 01:01:00.161
Now you fight without fear.

01:01:19.922 --> 01:01:22.720
What demon language
are you babbling?

01:01:26.462 --> 01:01:29.090
You're trying to tell me
something, aren't you?

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:05.196
An ancient incantation to release one
from another's unnatural control.

01:02:05.197 --> 01:02:07.767
Only I could not
administer it to myself.

01:02:07.768 --> 01:02:10.971
And from where did you learn
that little bit of magic?

01:02:10.972 --> 01:02:14.140
A book of mysticism written
by some dead philosopher.

01:02:14.141 --> 01:02:16.802
You always did live
in books, didn't you?

01:02:16.803 --> 01:02:18.139
Yes.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.477
But in death I am an Amazon.

01:02:40.836 --> 01:02:44.499
May we meet again in a
better place, sister.

01:03:08.698 --> 01:03:11.132
Your army continues to dwindle.

01:03:11.133 --> 01:03:12.699
As does yours.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:16.599
But the difference is I
no longer need an army.

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:37.856
Okay, one chance to
shoot this guy down.

01:03:47.737 --> 01:03:50.365
Come on. What's wrong? Why
isn't anything happening?

01:03:52.208 --> 01:03:54.199
No. No. No!

01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:07.283
Of course, invisible missiles.
Hardy flipping har.

01:04:30.312 --> 01:04:33.932
Have you not brought enough
death and misery upon us?

01:04:33.933 --> 01:04:37.484
I'm sorry, my queen. I never
meant to fall in love.

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.183
Love? The Amazons are warriors.

01:04:44.184 --> 01:04:46.850
You turned your back
on your sisters.

01:04:46.851 --> 01:04:51.432
No, it is you who did that when
you turned your back on mankind.

01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:58.955
You were given a life
of peace and beauty.

01:04:58.956 --> 01:05:02.865
And denied one of
families and children.

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:06.740
Yes, Hippolyta, the
Amazons are warriors...

01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:11.216
...but we are women too.

01:05:27.403 --> 01:05:30.235
Did your mother not warn you
this is how it would turn out?

01:05:30.236 --> 01:05:32.931
That you would suffer
at the wicked...

01:05:32.932 --> 01:05:34.201
...cruel...

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.809
...hands of man?

01:05:43.484 --> 01:05:45.118
You're no man.

01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:47.414
Not the kind I've come to know.

01:05:48.714 --> 01:05:51.325
Then you've learned
nothing, have you?

01:06:00.369 --> 01:06:03.134
Well, I have learned one thing.

01:06:03.135 --> 01:06:05.831
It's not polite to hit a lady.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.038
Zeus! Zeus!

01:07:06.335 --> 01:07:07.733
Mr. President.

01:07:07.734 --> 01:07:10.929
Mr. President, the threat
has been neutralized.

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:12.096
How?

01:07:12.097 --> 01:07:17.109
It seems by a group of
armored supermodels.

01:07:55.184 --> 01:07:58.778
<i>A tragedy, A terrible,
terrible tragedy,</i>

01:07:58.779 --> 01:08:01.444
How it weighs on my heart
to see you like this.

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:04.252
When my brother asked me not
to remove your bands...

01:08:04.253 --> 01:08:06.189
...he said I was
only dooming you...

01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:10.093
...that he could not save you
from yourself yet again.

01:08:10.866 --> 01:08:14.597
Perhaps I should have listened.

01:08:33.022 --> 01:08:35.183
Are you reading, dear sister?

01:08:35.724 --> 01:08:39.353
I am trying, my queen, but
it is fiercely boring.

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:43.286
So much has changed
in recent days.

01:08:48.703 --> 01:08:50.933
She misses the outside world.

01:08:50.934 --> 01:08:52.700
She misses him.

01:08:53.175 --> 01:08:54.801
Her task was completed.

01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:56.934
She had to return.

01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:04.544
What is this?

01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:06.015
It is your mission.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:09.212
It is why Hera delivered you
to us in the first place.

01:09:09.214 --> 01:09:14.362
It is time again to open the lines of
communication between man and woman.

01:09:14.363 --> 01:09:16.895
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

01:09:16.895 --> 01:09:21.434
And you, my daughter, will
serve as our ambassador.

01:09:21.435 --> 01:09:23.231
But there is one condition.

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:25.462
Yes?

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:28.769
You must visit home often.

01:09:43.492 --> 01:09:46.551
I lift cars. I can
lift car-door handles.

01:09:46.553 --> 01:09:48.321
We talked about this, Angel.

01:09:48.322 --> 01:09:50.055
I know. Sorry.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:54.601
Oh, thank you, Stevie.
You're such a gentleman.

01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:10.581
I guess I'll see you
at your apartment.

01:10:10.582 --> 01:10:14.621
Call if you're gonna be late. I
don't want dinner getting cold.

01:10:17.793 --> 01:10:20.284
Look, it's Wonder Woman.
