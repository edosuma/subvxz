00:02.271 --> 00:03.795
That was lovely.

00:03.873 --> 00:06.068
You know, it's obvious
you studied with culture.

00:06.809 --> 00:08.367
You seem to know
everything about me.

00:08.444 --> 00:09.934
No, l don't.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.480
l knew you
played the cello well.

00:14.517 --> 00:16.985
l didn't know
you serenaded eagles.

00:18.621 --> 00:21.089
l'm trying to get
her to trust me.

00:24.193 --> 00:25.285
To make her understand

00:25.361 --> 00:27.090
l won't hurt her
if she gets close.

(Dominic)
String,

01:44.039 --> 01:46.405
if you don't teach that mutt
to keep out of my way,

01:46.475 --> 01:48.204
so help me,
l'm gonna land on him!

01:48.277 --> 01:49.266
[panting]

01:49.445 --> 01:51.174
You know, l wouldn't
want to tell anyone

01:51.247 --> 01:52.271
where to land.

01:52.348 --> 01:54.282
And you could've
given me a hand.

01:54.350 --> 01:56.614
He's not big on
helping hands.

01:57.820 --> 01:59.117
But l am.

02:01.323 --> 02:02.722
Hey, let me take
one of those.

02:02.791 --> 02:03.849
No, no, no, no, no.

02:03.926 --> 02:05.860
l-- l don't
believe in women's lib.

02:06.095 --> 02:07.392
Excuse me?

02:07.463 --> 02:08.828
l-- l like, uh,

02:08.898 --> 02:11.833
l like the sexes
the way God intended them.

02:11.901 --> 02:13.926
The way
God intended them?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.800
l wouldn't press him,
Gabrielle.

02:15.938 --> 02:17.735
You won't like the answers.

02:19.275 --> 02:20.833
Well, l guess
l'm old-fashioned,

02:20.910 --> 02:23.470
but, uh,
that's my privilege, right?

02:23.545 --> 02:24.477
Right.

02:24.546 --> 02:26.537
So long as you've got
some red meat in there.

02:27.049 --> 02:31.110
Oh, l got steaks, and chops,
and burgers, and all of it.

02:31.186 --> 02:32.210
[chuckles]

02:32.288 --> 02:34.279
Well, Tet and l end up
eating most of them,

02:34.390 --> 02:36.324
but, uh,
we keep hopin'.

02:36.592 --> 02:37.616
Bless your heart.

02:37.693 --> 02:40.389
l haven't had anything
but vegetables for six days.

02:42.464 --> 02:44.091
Six days?

02:47.636 --> 02:48.625
Oh.

02:50.572 --> 02:51.596
Wow!

02:51.674 --> 02:54.302
l was beginning to
feel like a carrot.

02:54.476 --> 02:56.205
You could have been
a beautiful fish.

02:57.279 --> 02:59.008
Cute.

02:59.214 --> 03:02.308
Hey, Dom, l think
l found a canyon

03:02.384 --> 03:04.443
deep enough to do
that crop duster chase.

03:04.620 --> 03:05.609
Huh?

03:05.888 --> 03:07.788
For Bellisario's
film.

03:09.358 --> 03:10.347
Oh.

03:11.527 --> 03:12.858
lt will only
take an hour or so.

03:12.928 --> 03:14.259
You wanna
fix dinner?

03:14.430 --> 03:15.488
Sure.

03:16.365 --> 03:17.559
How do you like
your steak?

03:17.633 --> 03:18.895
Oh, no, no, no.
Count me out.

03:18.968 --> 03:21.630
l'm headin' for the field
just as soon as we get back.

03:21.904 --> 03:23.565
Just put on two.

03:24.106 --> 03:25.403
Two?

03:25.474 --> 03:27.305
Yeah, one for Tet
and one for you.

03:29.778 --> 03:31.109
Oh, yeah, and, uh,

03:32.314 --> 03:34.145
and catch me a trout.

03:34.850 --> 03:35.839
Ha!

03:37.886 --> 03:39.513
Nice meeting you,
Gabrielle.

03:39.655 --> 03:41.282
Yeah, you, too,
Mr. Santini.

03:41.457 --> 03:42.446
[chuckles]

03:43.258 --> 03:44.247
[door closes]

03:45.427 --> 03:47.725
Well, how do you like
your steak, Tet?

03:49.832 --> 03:50.821
[yelps]

03:51.100 --> 03:52.362
[helicopter whirring]

03:54.803 --> 03:56.293
(Dominic)
I Iike her, String.

03:56.672 --> 03:58.401
A IittIe SkinnY maYbe,
but I Iike her.

03:58.841 --> 04:01.207
(Hawke)
Yeah, She'II be thriIIed
to hear that.

04:01.443 --> 04:03.741
Yeah, but don't teII her
the SkinnY part.

04:04.847 --> 04:07.077
Did you get in
touch with Tony Boswick?

04:07.149 --> 04:08.275
Get in touch?

04:08.350 --> 04:10.113
He kept me on
the phone for over an hour.

04:10.185 --> 04:12.813
From England, yet.
And with me payin'.

04:14.923 --> 04:16.584
He remembered
the time

04:16.658 --> 04:19.387
that he and your dad
and l got drunk in Towbridge

04:19.461 --> 04:20.826
after the Schweinfurt raid,

04:20.896 --> 04:23.091
and we stole
a pig from a nunnery.

04:23.532 --> 04:24.692
[Dominic laughing]

04:26.602 --> 04:28.297
We took him
back to the field,

04:28.370 --> 04:30.634
fed him eight boxes
of prunes, and locked him

04:30.706 --> 04:31.730
in Gen. Baxter's office,

04:31.807 --> 04:33.866
[laughing]
overnight.

04:35.944 --> 04:38.811
Well, the next morning,
that office was...

04:38.881 --> 04:39.870
[laughing]

04:39.982 --> 04:41.313
[Dominic stops laughing]

04:43.719 --> 04:45.880
l guess you had to be there.

04:50.059 --> 04:51.856
When does Boswick's
charter fly to Libya?

04:51.927 --> 04:53.087
Every Friday.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.062
He's gonna have his
engineer call in sick

04:55.130 --> 04:57.064
at the last second
and l'll replace him.

04:57.232 --> 04:59.063
(Dominic)
But he can only
pull it off once.

04:59.134 --> 05:00.066
More than that,

05:00.135 --> 05:01.432
the Libyans will
get suspicious.

05:01.503 --> 05:03.403
(Hawke)
Once is all we'll need.

05:03.605 --> 05:06.403
l'll fly to Tripoli
a week from Wednesday.

05:06.475 --> 05:08.375
lf you come in
the Friday after that,

05:08.444 --> 05:10.810
it will give me
two days to set things up.

05:12.281 --> 05:15.216
l'll meet you in a club
called the Red Castle.

05:15.584 --> 05:17.245
The Red Castle. Okay.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.185
How long
till we get there?

05:19.922 --> 05:21.321
About an hour.

05:27.396 --> 05:29.762
(Dominic)
ThiS iS it.
VaIIeY of the GodS.

05:32.768 --> 05:34.827
Even the IndianS
don't come up here.

05:34.903 --> 05:37.371
Can you blame 'em?
lt's cold.

05:37.473 --> 05:38.497
[laughing]

05:38.574 --> 05:40.132
There's always
a little snow up here,

05:40.209 --> 05:41.198
even in summer.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.944
Sure would be
a bad place to go down.

05:44.012 --> 05:45.445
They'd never find you.

05:45.514 --> 05:47.209
That's just what
l'm looking for.

05:47.349 --> 05:49.078
Some place to get lost.

05:50.119 --> 05:51.984
Well, l've got that.

06:25.387 --> 06:27.252
How far down
does it go?

06:27.322 --> 06:30.291
l don't know. l never
hovered into it before.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.768
Thanks, Dom.
lt's perfect.

06:49.845 --> 06:52.040
Anytime, String,
anytime.

07:03.225 --> 07:04.214
(Hawke)
Hey, Tet.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.888
You tell her how
you want your steak?

07:10.732 --> 07:13.394
That smells so good,
l'm almost tempted to...

07:14.970 --> 07:16.164
Hope you don't mind.

07:16.238 --> 07:17.364
Since you don't eat meat,

07:17.439 --> 07:18.906
l didn't want it
to go to waste.

07:19.608 --> 07:20.768
Where's Gabrielle?

07:20.842 --> 07:21.900
l sent her ahead.

07:21.977 --> 07:23.444
We're moving up
the timetable.

07:23.979 --> 07:25.606
Four hours ago,
one of our destroyers

07:25.681 --> 07:27.478
went down in
the Gulf of Sirte.

07:27.549 --> 07:28.709
The press is being told

07:28.784 --> 07:30.547
that a missile went
off in the magazine.

07:30.619 --> 07:33.417
That it was an accident.
lt was Airwolf.

07:37.059 --> 07:38.356
Damn it.

07:38.694 --> 07:41.663
The President used
slightly stronger language.

07:41.763 --> 07:43.788
We've got 48 hours
to recover Airwolf

07:43.865 --> 07:45.628
or they're
sending in the Marines.

07:45.701 --> 07:47.828
(Archangel)
The Russians have
a missile task force

07:47.903 --> 07:50.201
shadowing our
carrier group in the Med.

07:50.706 --> 07:52.037
lf we invade Libya,

07:52.107 --> 07:53.938
chances are it'll
mean World War Three.

07:54.009 --> 07:54.998
[burping]

07:55.210 --> 07:57.337
Damn, that was a good steak.

08:02.084 --> 08:03.745
There's our ride.

08:03.819 --> 08:05.787
l've got 10 hours
to get you to Paris

08:05.854 --> 08:07.549
to catch a flight to Libya.

08:09.258 --> 08:11.556
l'll have someone stay here
to watch the place,

08:11.627 --> 08:13.686
take care of your dog.

08:13.762 --> 08:15.821
Tet takes care
of himself.

08:17.399 --> 08:19.629
Why'd you leave
Gabrielle here last week?

08:19.701 --> 08:21.430
To brief you.

08:22.704 --> 08:24.899
What about
my art collection?

08:25.674 --> 08:26.663
[sighs]

08:26.808 --> 08:28.742
l'm sorry about that,
Hawke.

08:28.810 --> 08:32.006
l told the committee
it was the wrong thing to do.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.475
l might have
taken it out on her.

08:35.851 --> 08:37.648
You didn't, did you?

08:38.687 --> 08:39.676
No.

08:45.193 --> 08:46.319
[cutlery crashing]

08:50.699 --> 08:52.496
l saved it for you.

08:52.801 --> 08:54.132
[airplane approaching]

09:06.682 --> 09:08.912
[man chattering
on P.A. SYStem in French]

09:14.489 --> 09:16.252
Stringfellow Hawke?

09:17.492 --> 09:18.481
Yeah.

09:19.394 --> 09:21.862
Strip out of your clothes,
please.

09:22.264 --> 09:23.959
(Faye)
Your flight suit,
take it off.

09:24.032 --> 09:25.727
We only have 16 minutes.

09:28.337 --> 09:30.567
Your name is
Michael Derrick.

09:30.639 --> 09:32.937
l was briefed as
Dr. Ted Burger.

09:33.008 --> 09:35.238
Dr. Burger was to go
to work next Wednesday.

09:35.310 --> 09:36.709
The Firm had to
pick another man

09:36.778 --> 09:38.143
on this flight.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.607
As near as
we can tell,

09:39.681 --> 09:41.376
Michael Derrick has
never gone to school

09:41.450 --> 09:43.384
or worked with any of
the other passengers.

09:44.486 --> 09:46.044
As near as
you can tell?

09:46.121 --> 09:49.090
Ten hours is rather
short notice, Mr. Hawke.

09:49.725 --> 09:51.420
Follow me, please.

09:52.060 --> 09:53.152
He's been working

09:53.228 --> 09:55.219
in a remote section
of Argentina for five years

09:55.297 --> 09:56.628
and went to
college in Australia.

09:56.698 --> 09:58.222
l don't think
you'll run into anybody

09:58.300 --> 09:59.289
who knows him.

09:59.368 --> 10:01.529
l've had his background
capsulized in story form.

10:01.603 --> 10:02.570
Chapter 10.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.935
Try to read it before you
speak to anyone on the plane.

10:05.006 --> 10:06.064
Latin LoverS?

10:06.141 --> 10:08.541
l told you,
l only had 10 hours.

10:09.578 --> 10:12.138
You've 40,000 francs,
a driver's license,

10:12.214 --> 10:14.944
girlfriend's photo,
love letter from her

10:15.016 --> 10:17.541
and 10 minutes to
catch your flight.

10:18.653 --> 10:20.018
Thank you.

10:20.088 --> 10:22.318
l was able to get
clothing in your sizes.

10:22.391 --> 10:23.517
Of course,
it's used.

10:23.592 --> 10:25.082
Even the underwear,
l'm afraid.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.094
l never
wear underwear.

10:27.162 --> 10:28.151
[men speaking French]

10:30.732 --> 10:33.098
You're on Air Libya,
Flight 2.

10:34.669 --> 10:36.261
One more thing.

10:36.605 --> 10:37.663
Angela is dead.

10:38.140 --> 10:39.107
How?

10:39.174 --> 10:41.199
We don't know.
Her family simply received

10:41.276 --> 10:43.369
a wire notifying
them of her death.

10:43.578 --> 10:44.875
We're hoping
it was an accident.

10:44.946 --> 10:46.004
Hoping?

10:46.081 --> 10:48.049
lf the Libyans made
her and she talked,

10:48.116 --> 10:49.242
they'll know
l'm coming.

10:49.317 --> 10:50.784
We don't think
they do.

10:50.919 --> 10:52.386
You don't think?

10:52.454 --> 10:53.853
There was
no time to check.

10:53.922 --> 10:55.981
All we could do was
to send in another operative

10:56.057 --> 10:58.082
who was familiar
with the situation.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.957
What other operative?

11:00.162 --> 11:01.390
¢Ü¢Ü[muSic pIaYing]

11:30.725 --> 11:32.659
ls this one
a spy, too?

11:33.595 --> 11:34.926
Probably.
She was supplied

11:34.996 --> 11:37.260
by the same
theatrical agency as Angela.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.536
(Moffet)
Angela was very fragile.

11:42.337 --> 11:45.568
This one appears to be
a little more substantial.

11:46.074 --> 11:47.769
Are you going to
be questioning her?

11:48.610 --> 11:50.339
Eventually.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.706
Perhaps l could be
of help.

12:34.990 --> 12:35.979
[panting]

13:11.393 --> 13:12.917
You all right?

13:15.497 --> 13:17.055
Yeah, l'm fine.

13:19.634 --> 13:22.068
What the hell
are you doin' here?

13:22.971 --> 13:24.199
My job.

13:27.409 --> 13:29.434
lt was Angela's job, too.

13:37.385 --> 13:38.613
l know.

13:40.555 --> 13:43.524
The girls said they
found her in the desert.

13:43.892 --> 13:45.382
He tortured
and killed her,

13:45.460 --> 13:47.087
the same as he did
to those other girls

13:47.162 --> 13:48.356
at White Sands.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.592
You were right
about Moffet.

13:53.668 --> 13:55.192
lt wasn't
the money.

13:55.737 --> 13:57.364
He stole Airwolf
so he could come here

13:57.439 --> 13:59.805
and do exactly what
he wanted with women.

14:04.746 --> 14:05.974

Where's
Airwolf?

14:30.538 --> 14:32.233
lt's at Kafir.

14:32.774 --> 14:34.139
That's Khadafy's
summer palace

14:34.209 --> 14:35.198
on the coast.

14:36.845 --> 14:38.437
Mirabelle has
an oil pumping station

14:38.513 --> 14:39.502

14:39.881 --> 14:42.247

Along the beach.

What do you mean ''l''?

15:04.706 --> 15:06.640
We're in this together.

You're on the next
Air Force flight out of here.

15:11.546 --> 15:13.070
The hell l am.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.180
l can fly Airwolf,
you can't.

15:17.686 --> 15:20.348
Either you're on
that flight, or l am.

15:24.259 --> 15:26.022
You're not serious?

15:30.131 --> 15:33.464
Stringfellow,
l'm not like the others.

15:34.436 --> 15:36.631
l'm not going to

15:46.247 --> 15:48.238

15:55.924 --> 15:57.289
Damn you.

Oh, l didn't mean that.

(Dominic)
Well, l caught the news
about that destroyer.

17:45.033 --> 17:47.627
l figured Airwolf
might be behind it,

17:47.702 --> 17:50.933
so l flew out to
the cabin and found Tet

17:51.005 --> 17:53.940
makin' eyes at some
cute little thing in white

17:54.008 --> 17:56.374
who said she was
housesittin' for you.

17:56.444 --> 17:57.570
Didn't take a genius

17:57.645 --> 17:59.306
to figure out
what happened, you know.

17:59.380 --> 18:00.938
How long
have you been here?

18:01.082 --> 18:02.640
Oh, a couple of hours.

18:02.717 --> 18:04.480
l hung around in
the club for a while,

18:04.552 --> 18:06.110
but too many guys
started asking

18:06.187 --> 18:07.313
too many questions.

18:07.388 --> 18:09.515
So l decided to
stay out in the alley.

18:09.591 --> 18:12.424
You always did like to take
the back way out of bars.

18:12.493 --> 18:14.688
lt's nice to
see you, too, Dom.

18:15.563 --> 18:17.861
You think you can
get this thing started?

18:17.932 --> 18:19.490
Hey, piece of cake.

18:20.368 --> 18:21.858
You sure are confident.

18:22.503 --> 18:24.027
The keys are in it.

18:30.511 --> 18:32.741
And you know
something, String?

18:32.814 --> 18:35.009
l could've sworn
one of those dancing girls

18:35.083 --> 18:36.448
was Gabrielle.

18:37.185 --> 18:38.379
lt was.

18:38.453 --> 18:40.785
Oh.
She going out with us?

Ahead of us.

18:42.657 --> 18:43.646
Oh.

18:45.059 --> 18:47.084
You know, girls

18:47.195 --> 18:48.184

Dom...

18:50.531 --> 18:53.762

18:55.703 --> 18:57.898

as a bug in a rug.

that--

19:01.809 --> 19:03.106
Dom, just

Huh?

she was the greatest thing
since peanut butter.

20:19.554 --> 20:20.543
Oh, God.

20:21.189 --> 20:22.952
You people, you are
really paranoid.

20:23.024 --> 20:24.252
Just because l'm American

20:24.325 --> 20:27.761

Then l'd like to see someone
who'll listen to reason.

33:36.083 --> 33:37.072
[trying to talk]

33:38.886 --> 33:41.821
l was going to call.
But Moffet...

33:42.756 --> 33:43.984
l know.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.118
l understand.

33:48.796 --> 33:50.286
l wanted to see
the eagle.

33:51.098 --> 33:52.588
You will.

33:54.802 --> 33:57.862
l remember you and
the eagle all the time.

33:58.939 --> 34:00.531
All the time.

34:06.647 --> 34:07.636
Gabrielle.

34:08.382 --> 34:09.371
Gabrielle.

34:10.384 --> 34:11.783
No.

34:14.788 --> 34:16.652
She promised me,
damn it!

34:16.790 --> 34:18.690
She promised me.

39:44.985 --> 39:47.920
String, it'S done.

40:15.048 --> 40:17.209
(Archangel)
l'm afraid we've lost him.

40:18.185 --> 40:20.415
He definitely
cleared Libyan airspace.

40:20.487 --> 40:23.320
Two F-1 4s from the EnterpriSe
were escorting him back

40:23.390 --> 40:25.221
when he disappeared.

40:25.358 --> 40:27.656
l don't give a damn
what the committee thinks.

40:27.727 --> 40:29.661
This time we're gonna
do it my way or you can

40:29.729 --> 40:31.754
kiss Airwolf
goodbye permanently.

40:32.199 --> 40:33.188
[slams phone]

40:34.701 --> 40:37.295
Could we borrow
one of your F-1 4s?

41:25.952 --> 41:26.941
[yelps]

41:33.893 --> 41:34.882
Yeah.

42:00.553 --> 42:03.147
(Archangel)
The committee
finally saw it my way.

42:05.225 --> 42:07.420
Where did you
hide it, Hawke?

42:07.527 --> 42:10.018
ln the mountains?
The desert?

42:11.898 --> 42:15.026
At that junkyard
Santini calls an airfield?

42:16.169 --> 42:18.034
l know he was
with you in Libya.

42:18.738 --> 42:20.638
lt'll be our little secret.

42:20.774 --> 42:22.799
But you've got to return it

42:22.876 --> 42:24.969
or they'll throw
you in a hole so deep,

42:25.045 --> 42:27.172
it'll take sunlight
a month to reach you.

42:29.449 --> 42:30.939
lt's wired.

42:32.152 --> 42:35.417
lf l don't make a phone call
every 24 hours, it's a goner.

42:37.957 --> 42:41.120
l told the committee
you'd do something like that.

42:41.194 --> 42:43.992
And l told you
l want Saint John.

42:47.367 --> 42:48.356
Yeah.

43:06.119 --> 43:08.417
(Archangel)
The President is very upset

43:08.755 --> 43:11.087
to say nothing of
the joint Chiefs of Staff,

43:11.157 --> 43:12.590
the Secretary of Defense,

43:12.659 --> 43:15.753
the FBl, the National
Security Council...

43:15.962 --> 43:18.294
Hell,
probably the Boy Scouts.

43:20.133 --> 43:23.466
But the only one
not upset is me.

43:26.873 --> 43:30.274
We built it,
lost it, recovered it.

43:30.977 --> 43:33.707
Well, sort of.
You were working for us.

43:34.180 --> 43:36.410
And now
we've lost it again.

43:38.017 --> 43:39.746
Hell, even if you were
to give it back,

43:39.819 --> 43:40.808
there's no way

43:40.887 --> 43:42.878
the President would ever
let the Firm use it.

43:48.061 --> 43:49.995
l'm not giving it back.

43:53.066 --> 43:55.057
At least, not for this.

43:57.003 --> 43:58.231
l know.

43:59.472 --> 44:01.030
But, Hawke,

44:01.474 --> 44:03.567
as long as
you've got Airwolf,

44:03.643 --> 44:05.133
Uncle Sam's minions

44:05.211 --> 44:06.803
have to keep looking
for your brother.

44:06.880 --> 44:09.474
They also have to try
to get it back from you.

44:09.649 --> 44:12.277
That's just the way
the game's played.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.142
[sighs]

44:15.655 --> 44:16.747
So?

44:17.390 --> 44:19.324
The Firm can help you,

44:19.492 --> 44:21.221
let you know what
the other agencies

44:21.294 --> 44:22.488
are doing to entrap you,

44:22.562 --> 44:26.191
supply you with funds,
lots of things.

44:26.633 --> 44:29.966
ln exchange for using Airwolf
on official business.

44:32.839 --> 44:35.307
Well, it's the only way
we're gonna get to use it.

44:35.375 --> 44:38.503
And probably the only way
you won't get caught.

44:48.922 --> 44:50.617
Here's your ride.

44:51.558 --> 44:52.547
[sighs]

44:54.294 --> 44:55.283
l always said

44:55.361 --> 44:57.829
you had better ears
than a snooper mike.

44:59.365 --> 45:00.354
Well,

45:01.734 --> 45:03.292
think about it.

45:09.509 --> 45:11.374
Then give me a call.

45:21.554 --> 45:23.317
Did she suffer?

45:28.394 --> 45:29.383
[sighs]

45:30.129 --> 45:31.426
What difference
does it make?

45:31.498 --> 45:32.465
Damn it!

45:32.532 --> 45:34.329
l sent her out there,
l want to know.

45:37.937 --> 45:39.097
No.

45:43.376 --> 45:45.344
No, she didn't suffer.

45:46.846 --> 45:48.643
Thank God
for that.
