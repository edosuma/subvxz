Nicky and Alex still hate me.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.067

08:47.027 --> 08:49.821
My, what a boney butt you have.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.908
I don't wanna go to school.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.205
- Mom, you shrunk.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.205
- Whoa!

09:00.581 --> 09:02.250
Well, you're finally up.

Next time, dragon breath

09:04.585 --> 09:06.754
I want to be notified.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.592
Rise and shine.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.592
It's a beautiful morning.

09:11.634 --> 09:16.181
Oh, somebody, turn down the sun.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.932
Have a pleasant night?

09:17.974 --> 09:20.894
Oh, it was awful.

09:20.935 --> 09:25.815
I had this horrible dream I was

09:20.935 --> 09:25.815
driving a white porcelain bus.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.775
That's because you spent

09:25.857 --> 09:27.775
the night with your head

09:27.817 --> 09:30.611
in the toilet, throwing up.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.988
Oh!

09:32.030 --> 09:34.032
No wonder every time

09:32.030 --> 09:34.032
I hit the turn signal

09:34.074 --> 09:36.034
I heard a flush.

09:37.869 --> 09:41.622
Do you have any memory

09:37.869 --> 09:41.622
of what happened last night?

09:41.664 --> 09:43.833
Yes, I do.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.753
You ruined the best night

09:43.875 --> 09:46.753
of my life.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.796
I ruined your night?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.173
Who do you think

09:48.838 --> 09:50.173
was holding your hair

09:50.215 --> 09:52.675
while you were driving

09:50.215 --> 09:52.675
that bus?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.594
Who-who let you sleep

09:52.717 --> 09:54.594
in their bed

09:54.635 --> 09:56.513
while they slept on a chair?

09:56.555 --> 09:59.140
Who called your parents

09:56.555 --> 09:59.140
and covered for you?

09:59.182 --> 10:02.143
You're just jealous because

09:59.182 --> 10:02.143
I was the life of the party.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.604
[scoffs]

10:02.185 --> 10:04.604
You are so off.

Oh, please.

10:04.645 --> 10:08.108

Kimmy, where have you been?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.668
You promised

10:26.000 --> 10:27.668
you wouldn't leave me alone.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.171
[English accent]

with these

10:30.213 --> 10:33.508
incredibly engaging young men.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.886
I hate this party. None of

10:33.550 --> 10:36.886
the cool guys will talk to me.

10:36.928 --> 10:41.266
<i>Au contraire.</i> I find

10:36.928 --> 10:41.266
the guests quite obliging.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.604
Oh, Kimmy, would you honor us

10:41.308 --> 10:45.604
with a poem?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.688
If you insist.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.609
This is one of my favorites.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.171
so clever and witty.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.423
Not to mention coordinated.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.591
And I hate it!

11:14.633 --> 11:16.384
We're going home

11:14.633 --> 11:16.384
and I'm driving.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.638
I'm tired of taking

11:16.426 --> 11:19.638
a back seat to you.

11:19.678 --> 11:23.475
No, don't take her from us.

11:19.678 --> 11:23.475
She's a national treasure.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.769
The party will die

11:23.517 --> 11:26.769
without her grace and charm.

Hello, news flash. I saved

11:33.527 --> 11:37.155

11:37.197 --> 11:40.408
You embarrassed my scrawny neck

11:37.197 --> 11:40.408
last night.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.327
I think it's time

11:40.450 --> 11:42.327
we went our separate ways.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.954
Oh, that's the first coherent

11:42.369 --> 11:44.954
thing you've said all day.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.541
Oh, good. We agree.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.541
This friendship is over.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.043
- Fine with me.

11:51.919 --> 11:54.130

17:54.615 --> 17:56.868
Kimmy along if you'd like.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.997
I wouldn't invite Kimmy to

17:56.910 --> 18:00.997
any place where humans gather.

18:01.039 --> 18:04.291
Oh, so I take it you two

18:01.039 --> 18:04.291
had a little argument.

18:04.333 --> 18:08.087
Little in the sense

18:04.333 --> 18:08.087
that we're never talking again.

18:08.128 --> 18:11.007
The truth is Kimmy slept here

18:08.128 --> 18:11.007
last night because she got drunk

18:11.049 --> 18:13.718
at that party,

18:11.049 --> 18:13.718
and couldn't go home.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.013
I hope you weren't drinking too.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.390
No, dad, don't worry.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.390
I-I wasn't drinking.

18:19.432 --> 18:23.853
And I drove home...

18:19.432 --> 18:23.853
after I fought her for the keys.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.439
Oh, man. It's a good thing

18:23.895 --> 18:26.439
you were there.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.608
Why didn't you tell me

18:26.480 --> 18:28.608
about this last night?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.484
I should have,

18:28.649 --> 18:30.484
but I was afraid

18:30.526 --> 18:32.486
you wouldn't

18:30.526 --> 18:32.486
let me see her again.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.782
But that's just fine

18:32.528 --> 18:35.782
with me.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.242
Well, Deej, I know I say

18:35.823 --> 18:38.242
a lot of things about Kimmy

18:38.284 --> 18:40.327
being an annoying,

18:38.284 --> 18:40.327
obnoxious nuisance

18:40.369 --> 18:42.872
and I mean every one of them..

18:42.914 --> 18:45.332
...but she's still

18:42.914 --> 18:45.332
your best friend.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.418
If somebody

18:45.374 --> 18:47.418
makes a wrong choice

18:47.460 --> 18:48.836
I don't think you can just

18:48.878 --> 18:51.631
walk away from them

18:48.878 --> 18:51.631
and ignore 'em.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.424
Yeah, well, I-I really

18:51.672 --> 18:53.424
don't wanna spend

18:53.466 --> 18:56.719
the rest of my life with Kimmy

18:53.466 --> 18:56.719
draped over my shoulder.

18:56.761 --> 18:59.430
She's just not the kind of

18:56.761 --> 18:59.430
person I wanna hang out with.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.726
Yeah, but you're the kind

19:00.848 --> 19:03.726
of person she needs.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.645
Especially now,

19:03.768 --> 19:05.645
don't you think?

19:12.902 --> 19:14.862
I thought you'd have

19:12.902 --> 19:14.862
made it home by now.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.906
I'm pacing myself.

19:16.948 --> 19:20.743
My objective

19:16.948 --> 19:20.743
is the fence by nightfall.

19:20.785 --> 19:24.413
- Kimmy, you're so hungover.

19:20.785 --> 19:24.413
- Oh, stop screamin'.

19:24.455 --> 19:26.874
I don't need to hear

19:24.455 --> 19:26.874
any more lectures from you.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.709
Well, what you need

19:26.916 --> 19:28.709
to hear is exactly

19:28.751 --> 19:30.544
what happened

19:28.751 --> 19:30.544
at that party last night.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.588
<i>I was actually</i>

19:30.586 --> 19:32.588
<i>having a good time.</i>

19:32.630 --> 19:34.632
<i>I was talking </i>

19:32.630 --> 19:34.632
<i>to these two nice guys.</i>

19:34.674 --> 19:36.258
<i>You were off</i>

19:34.674 --> 19:36.258
<i>somewhere getting drunk.</i>

19:36.300 --> 19:38.094
[indistinct chattering]

19:39.720 --> 19:42.807
- It's showtime.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.807
- 'Hey.'

19:42.849 --> 19:44.266
Kimmy, Kimmy, don't do this.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.269
Out of my way,

19:44.308 --> 19:47.269
Little Miss Perfect.

19:49.022 --> 19:53.192
Alright, attention,

19:49.022 --> 19:53.192
ladies and gentle-dudes.

19:53.233 --> 19:58.280
I would like to recite

19:53.233 --> 19:58.280
a little poem entitled Gas.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.199
[burps]

20:00.240 --> 20:01.659
[all groaning]

20:01.701 --> 20:04.162
Thank you.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.162
I wrote that one myself.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.707
And now for my encore.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.709
Hey, snacks.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.924
[shattering]

20:16.966 --> 20:18.425
Oh, dear.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.011
Who invited her?

20:20.053 --> 20:22.513
[coughing]

20:27.143 --> 20:30.688
Hey, hey, I want you to get

20:27.143 --> 20:30.688
your friend out of here now.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.439
Oh, sure, she's boring.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.401
That's no reason

20:32.481 --> 20:35.401
to kick her out of the party.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.528
We already kicked out the guys

20:35.442 --> 20:37.528
who brought the beer.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.613
If we get caught,

20:37.570 --> 20:39.613
we could lose our charter.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.948
I'm sorry. We're leaving.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.910
- Kimmy, give me the keys.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.910
- I think not.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.454
If you're making me leave,

20:43.951 --> 20:47.454
at least I can just drive home.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.416
Kimmy, you're in no condition

20:47.496 --> 20:50.416
to drive home.

20:50.457 --> 20:53.878
But if I walk,

20:50.457 --> 20:53.878
I might fall and hurt myself.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.379
Let's go.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.926
Oh, I told you so.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.762
<i>(D.J.)</i>

20:59.967 --> 21:02.762
<i>And that's what</i>

20:59.967 --> 21:02.762
<i>really happened.</i>

21:02.803 --> 21:04.764
You just can't admit

21:02.803 --> 21:04.764
you were jealous of me.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.850
You had to embarrass me

21:04.805 --> 21:07.850
and take my car keys like..

21:07.892 --> 21:09.435
...like I'm some kind of child.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.395
Kimmy, you could barely walk.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.607
It's my life.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.607
What do you care?

21:14.648 --> 21:17.193
I'm sorry. I do care.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.820
My mom died

21:17.235 --> 21:19.820
because of a drunk driver.

21:19.862 --> 21:22.698
I wasn't gonna lose

21:19.862 --> 21:22.698
my best friend the same way.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.626
Deej..

21:33.667 --> 21:35.419
...I'm sorry.

21:37.588 --> 21:41.217
I know. I made an idiot

21:37.588 --> 21:41.217
out of myself last night.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.720
I didn't know how

21:41.259 --> 21:44.720
to talk to those frat guys.

21:44.762 --> 21:48.933
But after a-a couple of drinks,

21:44.762 --> 21:48.933
I started to loosen up.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.145
For the first time in my life,

21:48.975 --> 21:52.145
I felt cool.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.190
Well, Kimmy, they called you

21:53.771 --> 21:56.190
a lot of things at that party

21:56.232 --> 21:59.735
but cool wasn't one of them.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.029
Well, Deej, how come

21:59.777 --> 22:02.029
you weren't nervous?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.573
Are you kidding?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.573
I was a wreck.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.408
I was talking

22:04.615 --> 22:06.408
to this really cute guy

22:06.450 --> 22:08.535
and-and he kept smiling at me.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.329
And then I-I looked down,

22:08.577 --> 22:10.329
and I realized

22:10.370 --> 22:13.373
that my elbow

22:10.370 --> 22:13.373
was in the clam dip.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.835
Oh, man, I would

22:13.415 --> 22:15.835
have been so humiliated.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.963
Yeah, well,

22:15.876 --> 22:18.963
it wasn't my finest moment.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.674
But in some weird way,

22:19.005 --> 22:21.674
it broke the ice

22:21.715 --> 22:24.802
and we were laughing about it.

22:24.844 --> 22:29.515
So, the trick to staying calm is

22:24.844 --> 22:29.515
to keep your elbow in the dip?

22:29.556 --> 22:33.102
The trick is to remember

22:29.556 --> 22:33.102
that everybody is nervous

22:33.144 --> 22:36.856
and it's a lot easier to handle

22:33.144 --> 22:36.856
if you stay in control.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.276
I'm glad one of us did.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.279
Thanks, D.J.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.543
