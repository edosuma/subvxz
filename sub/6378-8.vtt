00:11.678 --> 00:14.260
Godric, it's me.

00:21.772 --> 00:22.932
You should not have come.

00:25.901 --> 00:26.936
Bill.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.729
No.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.021
I'm here, my child. Down here.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.994
Godric.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.712
You were a fool
for sending humans after me.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.878
I had no other choice.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.759
These savages, they--

00:55.222 --> 00:57.304
They seek to destroy you.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.181
I'm aware
of what they have planned.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.594
This one betrayed you.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.137
He's with the Fellowship.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.146
They set a trap for us.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.651
-How long has it been since you've fed?
-I require very little blood anymore.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.485
Save the human.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.235
-Go on.
-I am not leaving your side until you--

01:19.413 --> 01:21.825
-I can take care of myself.
-Come on, we have to go.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.993
Spill no blood
on your way out.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.163
Go.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.601
I'm alive.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.444
Holy shit.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.741
God saved me.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.198
l'm saved.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.206
Oh, for heaven's sake,
grow a brain cell!

03:29.376 --> 03:31.958
-Paintballs!
-What's--?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.371
You crazy bitch.

03:36.758 --> 03:42.970
I let you into my house, into my bed
and into my heart.

03:43.140 --> 03:47.804
All I stood for, all I believed in,
l violated to be with you.

03:47.978 --> 03:52.768
-Okay.
-I gave you everything for a lie.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.809
-You're worse than Judas.
-Why? What did he do to you?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.235
Fuck you.

04:00.323 --> 04:04.657
Oh, sweet Jesus.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.036
Okay. I'm sorry, okay?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.583
Just tell me
what you want me to say.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.457
-Don't shoot again.
-You came to prey on me...

04:12.627 --> 04:15.835
...to ruin the sacred vow I made,
then like a coward, you ran.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.746
No, I didn't--

04:17.924 --> 04:20.666
Okay, I ran, but it wasn't from you.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.757
It was from your husband
and his crazy weapon collection.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.344
-Why'd you have to go and tell him?
-Tell him?

04:28.518 --> 04:31.009
ldidn't tell him anything.
He's the one who told me.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.938
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.144
Told you what?

04:37.903 --> 04:40.815
There are wolves in our henhouse.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.318
We must defend our flock.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.451
-Well, what's that got to do--?
-We have your sister.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.696
Sookie's in the church?

04:50.874 --> 04:53.991
She came in yesterday
spouting the same lies you told.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.540
You listen to me.
She's got nothing to do with this.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.581
You Stackhouses.

05:01.384 --> 05:04.968
You're nothing but a bunch of heartless...

05:05.138 --> 05:09.848
...two-faced vampire fuckers.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.723
Don't you ever talk about
my sister like that.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.433
And if I find out any of you
so much as touched her...

05:19.611 --> 05:22.148
...l'm gonna come back here...

05:22.447 --> 05:25.530
...and it won't be
with no fucking paint gun!

05:40.841 --> 05:43.423
Brothers and sisters,
we are on Iockdown.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.710
Women with children, please take them
to our classroom buildings.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.173
Men and able-bodied women...

05:48.348 --> 05:51.260
...security personnel will provide you
with stakes and silver...

05:51.434 --> 05:52.719
...just outside the chapel.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.886
Our Soldiers of the Sun are on their way
to protect our church...

05:56.064 --> 05:58.225
...but safely evacuate the building now.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.016
Brothers and sisters, the hour is upon us.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.856
-I could have you out in seconds.
-There's kids out there.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.112
Humans wouldn't think twice
about hurting us.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.939
Why didn't you bring Bill with you?

06:08.118 --> 06:11.576
His attachment to you is irrational.
lt clouds his judgment.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.742
He would kill every child
in this church to save you.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.032
Why aren't you?

06:17.794 --> 06:21.127
l'm following Godric's orders
and getting you out, that's all.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.788
He's your maker, isn't he?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.206
Don't use words you don't understand.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.800
You have a lot of love for him.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.134
Don't use words I don't understand.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.304
Let's lock it up.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.472
Keep quiet.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.900
All right, lock it up.
Nobody comes through here.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.105
Eric, no.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.909
Trust me.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.997
-You got your silver chain?
-ls it locked?

07:02.172 --> 07:05.084
-Did you check upstairs?
-Oh, hey, y'all. How's it going?

07:06.635 --> 07:09.422
Steve sent me over
to man the exit here.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.011
Think I can take it from here.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.843
-By yourself?
-Yeah.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.593
You're big and all,
but there's a vampire on the loose.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.640
Where's your stake?

07:21.358 --> 07:22.689
Dang.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.857
| forgot.

07:27.489 --> 07:30.572
Maybe I can borrow yours, if that's okay.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.988
I can't do that. Get your own.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.030
I very much would like
to borrow your stake.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.702
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be okay, I guess.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.207
Stake!

07:52.889 --> 07:56.381
Eric! You don't have to kill him.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.230
-Come on.
-Come on, gotta do this.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.732
Those arrows are wood.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.735
-You'll never make it through.
-Eric, through the sanctuary.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.862
-Where's the exit?
-Back that way.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.123
There are several exits, actually.

08:22.293 --> 08:26.707
For you, the easiest one
takes you straight to hell.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.593
Letusleave.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.927
Save yourselves.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.342
No one has to die.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.728
The war has begun,
you evil whore of Satan.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.765
You vampires cast the first stone
by killing my family.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.025
The lines have been drawn.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.779
You're either with us or against us.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.779
We are prepared for Armageddon.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.695
The vampire
you're holding prisoner got away.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.455
He's a sheriff.
He's bound to send for help.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.536
I'm not concerned with Godric.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.748
Any vampire will do
for our grand celebration...

09:07.922 --> 09:09.253
...and we got one right here.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.134
I'll be fine.

09:27.484 --> 09:33.730
Brothers and sisters,
there will be a holy bonfire at dawn.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.983
Look,dean

09:38.161 --> 09:39.992
Room Service sent a gift for us.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.870
No. No, I don't do any--

09:44.667 --> 09:46.077
Heart's pounding.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.458
So much tastier.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.168
How considerate of you.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.793
SooMe.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.462
That bothersome human.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.552
Just like an alarm clock
you can't switch off.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.759
Blah, blah, blah.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.345
And 10 minutes later, blah.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.352
I'll give you first bite.

10:06.523 --> 10:09.640
-I am not hungry.
-Oh, come now.

10:09.818 --> 10:15.154
As I recall,
your appetite was always insatiable.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.861
This human act you do for your girlfriend
is charming and all...

10:19.035 --> 10:20.775
...but we both know better.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.536
Don't we?

10:23.706 --> 10:27.039
-Please. I don't wanna die.
-Let him go.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.497
|wi||.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.837
Soon.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.508
No.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.010
This one's different.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.678
I've never tasted....

10:48.815 --> 10:50.305
What are you?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.793
You okay? You okay?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.583
-l'm not hurting you?
-No, not anymore.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.753
Oh, goodness.
Shut up. Keep going.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.675
Oh, |--

11:29.814 --> 11:34.934
I don't know what you heard,
but those were screams of pleasure.

11:35.111 --> 11:39.275
-Right?
-Oh, my God.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.442
If you truly care for her, you will take her
to your car this very moment...

11:43.620 --> 11:46.362
...and drive her back to Bon Temps
before the sun comes up.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.788
-Now?
-Now.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.244
Lovers.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.258
-Oh, shit, hooker.
-What?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.759
Isn't the lovers good?

12:01.930 --> 12:03.545
Not for you it ain't.

12:03.723 --> 12:08.262
In this position, it calls for a sacrifice
in matters of the heart.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.802
You gonna have to make a choice.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.561
But it might turn out well, right?

12:16.194 --> 12:17.900
You wanna see your future?

12:20.823 --> 12:22.324
Tara, help me.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.324
I need to talk to you.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.988
Yeah, sure.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.997
I'm gonna go and clean a grill
or something.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.176
Say something.
You're freaking me out.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.221
-What time is it?
-What?

12:51.396 --> 12:54.263
-What time is it?
-|t's 10 past 12. We just closed, why?

12:55.525 --> 12:58.062
Look, it happened again.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.692
I've lost the last couple hours.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.022
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.528
You don't remember anything?

13:02.699 --> 13:06.817
I mean, after I left you, I got in my car,
and, baby, next thing I know...

13:06.995 --> 13:10.533
...l'm over past Parish Road
and I'm over by the lake.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.662
And I wake up on the ground,
it's freezing cold...

13:16.212 --> 13:19.295
...and I don't even know how I got there.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.176
Tara, what the hell
is wrong with me?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.721
It's okay. It's okay.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.098
I'm here.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.055
Lafayette, you okay to close up?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.561
Yeah. Yeah, y'all go on ahead.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.101
Come on, let's get you home.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.860
Someone's coming.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.168
-Hey, hey. Who are you?
-|t's okay.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.873
I'm with the Fellowship.
You gotta let me in.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.790
Sorry, bro. We're in lockdown.
There's a vampire inside.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.002
Yeah.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.088
That's why they sent for me.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.925
I'm a cadet
with the Light of Day Institute.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.430
Came strapped.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.768
Honesty.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.265
Dude, honesty.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.234
-Come on.
-Let's move.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.354
Now, we got the vampire surrounded.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.909
He's got some f-ing
fangbanger chick with him.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.613
Now, I'm gonna take you to Steve.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.152
No. I got it.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.036
No, he needs you to--

14:34.207 --> 14:37.449
Hey, is that a paintball gun?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.294
Yeah, it is.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.877
Who is this?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.151
Hello.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.151
Jesus Christ.

17:36.681 --> 17:41.391
Renard Parish Sheriff's Department.
What's your emergency?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.392
-Sheriff's Department.
-ls anyone there?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.848
Anyone in there?

17:45.022 --> 17:47.729
This is the Sheriff’s Department.
Can / help you?

17:49.694 --> 17:51.150
Hello ?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.081
You see?

18:51.255 --> 18:55.043
Just as our lord, our savior,
was betrayed for 30 pieces of silver...

18:55.217 --> 18:58.880
...a few ounces of silver
can betray a child of Satan to the world!

18:59.055 --> 19:02.639
That doesn't make any sense.
How can you people listen to him?

19:05.353 --> 19:09.562
I offer myself
in exchange for Godric's freedom.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.395
And the girl's as well.

19:13.569 --> 19:17.983
That's noble,
but she's just as culpable as you are.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.565
She's a traitor to her race.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.900
The human race.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.411
She hardly deserves mercy.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.491
Maybe we should tie her to you
so you can meet the sun together.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.337
Bet this marshmallow
would roast up nicely.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.753
SooMe!

19:40.513 --> 19:43.220
One more step, vampire, and the girl dies.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.431
If you shoot her, everyone here will die.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.012
Let her go now.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.811
Honestly, what do they see in you?

19:50.981 --> 19:53.108
Soldiers, some silver chains
for our friend.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.561
-Don't. He's done nothing to you.
-I will be fine.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.442
Newlin!

20:01.242 --> 20:02.607
Let her go, fuckwad!

20:10.584 --> 20:11.790
Son of a bitch!

20:13.212 --> 20:15.203
SooMe.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.165
Let's go.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.301
-Eric, do not kill him.
-Kill him.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.636
Kill the motherfucker!

20:28.811 --> 20:30.642
Go ahead.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.813
Murder us.
Murder us before God.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.314
We are willing to die.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.236
Steve Newlin.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.073
You have pushed us too far.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.489
You expect us to sit on our thumbs...

20:52.668 --> 20:55.455
...while you round up your men
to come lynch us?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.245
We'll kill you first.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.010
-Same way we did your father.
-Oh, God, no.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.886
Murderer!

21:07.808 --> 21:10.845
Destroy them. All of them.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.474
-Bill, Eric, stop them!
-We have to go now!

21:20.070 --> 21:21.355
Enough.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.617
You came for me, I assume.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.453
Underling?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.456
Yeah, sheriff.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.163
These people have not harmed me.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.835
You see? We can coexist.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.628
Mr. Newlin...

21:46.388 --> 21:49.880
...I do not wish to create bloodshed
where none is called for.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.056
Help me set an example.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.851
If we leave you in peace,
will you do the same?

21:58.901 --> 22:03.861
I will not negotiate with subhumans.

22:05.199 --> 22:06.530
-Kill me.
-No!

22:06.700 --> 22:08.565
Do it.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.742
Jesus will protect me.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.072
I'm actually older than your Jesus.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.083
| wish I could have known him,
but I missed it.

22:22.550 --> 22:28.011
Good people, who of you is willing
to die for this man's madness?

22:31.308 --> 22:32.764
That's what I thought.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.009
Stand down, everyone.

22:36.939 --> 22:41.524
People, go home. It's over now.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.309
Oh, thank God, Bill.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.603
It's all right. You're safe now.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.613
You're safe.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.992
Please, don't leave me.

22:57.084 --> 23:01.578
l daresay my faith in humankind
is stronger than yours.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.548
Come.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.972
Sir, after what these humans
have done to you?

23:14.143 --> 23:15.474
I said, come.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.267
-Are you sure you're okay?
-She's fine.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.228
Go with your maker.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.148
Sookie. Sookie, come here.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.914
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Will you please forgive me?

23:36.081 --> 23:38.823
What were you doing with those people?
You out of your mind?

23:39.001 --> 23:41.083
Yeah, I was. Just....

23:43.339 --> 23:47.048
That son of a bitch sucked out my brain
and planted all his own babies in there.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.923
You know nothing.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.504
On the final day of reckoning...

23:52.681 --> 23:57.345
...we'll see who goes to heaven
and who goes to hell.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.604
I reckon I've already been to heaven.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.856
It was inside your wife.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.690
Jason, come on.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.230
What about that?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.991
-Come on.
-Take your ring.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.115
Honesty, my ass, shithead.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.621
White-suit motherfucker.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.788
Go home, preacher boy.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.003
Come on, Sam.
We can’t tell you that.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.221
That's why it's called
an anonymous tip.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.053
We can't tell you
who phoned it in.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.469
They wanted you to find me.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.980
Why would I keep a body
in my own refrigerator?

24:47.152 --> 24:49.234
-Was it a woman's voice?
-Sam.

24:49.405 --> 24:53.899
There's a rumor you were having
a relationship with the deceased. That true?

24:54.576 --> 24:56.862
-Yeah.
-We|l, you don't seem too beat up about it.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.823
Well, we--

24:59.581 --> 25:01.867
-I guess we kind of broke up.
-Were you angry?

25:02.042 --> 25:07.253
-Bound to be some hurt feelings.
-Listen, y'all have to trust me.

25:07.423 --> 25:11.086
This is bigger and crazier
than you can even imagine.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.876
I'll say.
This is the second time in two weeks...

25:14.054 --> 25:16.545
...a woman's found in your bar
with her heart missing.

25:16.724 --> 25:19.511
And the third time a waitress of yours
has ended up dead.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.803
Oh, come on. That was Rene Lenier.
You can't use that against me.

25:24.106 --> 25:27.223
Now, come on, Bud, Kenya.
Listen to yourselves.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.767
-You know me.
-l'm not sure we do.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.903
You got no birth records,
no Social Security number.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.530
We can't even find
where you went to high school.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.450
It's hard to explain.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.112
Save it, son.
Nothing about your past ever checks out.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.623
Why don't you just tell us
what happened tonight?

25:47.212 --> 25:48.372
What the--?

25:49.465 --> 25:51.751
Hold up. Bud, you don't think
it's Sam, do you?

25:51.925 --> 25:53.461
-Let me get him.
-Hold on, Kenya.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.635
You're on suspension.

25:56.805 --> 26:00.093
-How'd you hear about this?
-Still got my radio.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.679
I'm not here as a cop, okay?
I'm a witness.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.389
-You got the wrong guy.
-What?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.849
Sam's not the one you want.
He's a victim.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.265
I saw him nearly get killed last night.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.104
-By who?
-The bull.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.860
-The what?
-Oh, Andy.

26:14.031 --> 26:18.946
-He thinks he saw some kind of bull.
-With claws. A bull. In a dress.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.701
-With claws.
-Okay, Andy, you're babbling again.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.487
-I can shut him up.
-And your vic.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.496
That vic, she was part of this group...

26:25.667 --> 26:28.124
...of crazy people
that was trying to get him.

26:28.295 --> 26:32.629
I tried to fight them off, but--
War wound.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.509
l'm corroborating here, Sam.
Tell them. Help me.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.806
If I told you that's what happened,
would you believe me?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.971
Oh, shit.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.399
But you're not the only one.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.902
l blacked out last night,
Arlene blacked out....

26:56.073 --> 26:57.904
Maybe there's some kind of gas leak.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.361
But what about Andy Bellefleur?

27:00.536 --> 27:02.072
He said he saw all of us.

27:02.246 --> 27:06.159
Andy's the only one
we know is out his mind.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.206
Tara...

27:09.169 --> 27:12.878
...I got this sick feeling
I did something real bad.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.209
Knock, knock.

27:15.551 --> 27:17.416
Hope I'm not interrupting.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.803
No, we're just trying to piece together
everything we been doing past couple days.

27:24.393 --> 27:27.726
Sounds like somebody's been
enjoying himself a bit too much.

27:30.816 --> 27:34.559
Tell you what. Why don't we ease up
on the partying for a little while?

27:34.736 --> 27:36.476
Take it easy.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.073
Hey. Snack's ready.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.039
Hope you're hungry.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.248
Oh, my God.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.084
That looks amazing. What is it?

27:56.425 --> 27:58.086
Hunter's souffle.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.251
I didn't know hunters made souffles.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.545
Most don't. Dig in.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.417
Goddamn.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.962
What is in there?
Is that the rabbit you caught?

28:45.307 --> 28:46.638
Among other things.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.806
You have got to try this.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.819
Oh, my God.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.931
Thank you, sir.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.690
Welcome home, sheriff.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.602
We are all very relieved.

29:47.744 --> 29:52.363
Well, ljust want to say I'm real sorry
for what the Fellowship put you through.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.626
You helped save many lives today,
Mr. Stackhouse.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.214
Please know you have friends in this area
whenever you visit.

30:02.926 --> 30:07.044
Thanks, man, but I don't know if I'll be
wanting to come back anytime soon.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.724
God.

30:18.692 --> 30:20.808
Hail the conquering hero.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.439
Oh, no. I'm no hero.

30:23.613 --> 30:25.569
No, you are in this town.

30:25.741 --> 30:30.360
But in my area we know you well
as a buyer and user of vampire blood.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.073
And that's a very grave offense.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.659
Yeah, listen.
I don't do that no more.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.826
All things considered, however,
we'll call it even.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.372
But you won't be doing it again.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.254
-Yeah. No.
-No.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.090
No. Got it.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.095
Good boy. Run along.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.480
It's the best we could do.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.687
Thanks, this is great.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.942
You've avoided
being alone with me all night.

31:08.116 --> 31:10.778
Nonsense. With all the commotion,
there's hardly been time.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.409
Bill, l was in that basement
for two days.

31:13.580 --> 31:16.617
You don't even want to know
what almost happened to me down there.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.744
Where were you?

31:18.919 --> 31:23.083
-Sookie, it's--
-"|t's complicated" is not an answer.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.587
Every time I've needed you...

31:24.758 --> 31:28.421
...you've always come running,
even in broad daylight.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.586
What kept you?

31:32.724 --> 31:37.468
-l was held.
-Held? Like kidnapped?

31:37.979 --> 31:40.140
By who?

31:40.482 --> 31:42.598
By Eric?

31:44.194 --> 31:47.903
Heard my name.
I hope you were speaking well of me.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.815
Why should I?
You let me walk into a trap.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.449
I regret that.
If I had known it was a possibility--

31:53.620 --> 31:57.659
You did know. But because it was Godric,
you'd risk anything.

31:58.166 --> 32:02.785
The bond between a vampire and his maker
is stronger than you can imagine.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.832
Perhaps one day you'll find out.

32:22.649 --> 32:26.813
What's the matter?
What, you don't like me anymore?

32:29.156 --> 32:30.236
No, | just don't think--

32:30.407 --> 32:33.570
Bill might not like us
doing this stuff in his house.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.699
He'll never know.

32:35.871 --> 32:38.533
Come on, you drove so fast,
I know you want to again.

32:38.707 --> 32:43.041
Besides, we got two hours before dawn.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.969
I can't believe I waited so long.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.806
We are gonna do it every single night
whether you want to or not.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.556
-You still want to, don't you?
-We|l, sure, yeah.

33:05.734 --> 33:09.067
It's just that Sookie and Bill
might come in any minute.

33:10.071 --> 33:12.904
We got the house to ourselves.
I promise.

33:29.216 --> 33:32.424
I've never wanted anything
so bad in my life.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.925
Make love to me again.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.756
Please.

33:38.475 --> 33:41.933
Do me. Now.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.610
-Wait, stop, stop.
-Okay, okay.

33:59.788 --> 34:00.948
Sorry.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.114
-What happened?
-I don't know. It ju--

34:05.085 --> 34:06.450
I mean, it felt like--

34:09.923 --> 34:12.585
Is that blood again?

34:16.680 --> 34:19.467
Oh, my God.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.801
No.

34:20.976 --> 34:24.264
Oh, no, no, no.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.814
-What, Jessica, what?
-It grew back.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.474
-lt? What?
-My-- It fucking grew back.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.232
-Oh, jeez.
-I should have known.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.943
I mean, everything heals
when you're a goddamn vampire.

34:37.117 --> 34:40.109
Okay, come on. Come on.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.486
It's gonna be beautiful.

34:42.664 --> 34:46.373
-Every time will be like our first time.
-|t'|| hurt like hell.

34:46.835 --> 34:50.043
I'm a fucking deformity of nature.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.169
I'm gonna be a virgin forever.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.606
I don't like being touched.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.606
Well, believe me,
I do not like touching you.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.776
Your contact with Sookie
will cease this moment.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.527
Oh, that's hardly your decision.

35:16.698 --> 35:20.361
Calling in my maker because you couldn't
win Sookie for yourself...

35:20.535 --> 35:22.366
...is feeble and desperate even for you.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.529
Are you picking a fight?

35:28.001 --> 35:31.209
-|'d like to see you try.
-She will never be yours.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.290
And there is nothing you can do.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.335
In this you are powerless.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.128
Accept it.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.386
Here is the one who betrayed us.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.354
Hugo.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.816
-He's your human, is he not?
-Yes, he is.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.576
Do you love him?

36:13.922 --> 36:16.038
I thought I did.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.932
It appears you love him still.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.844
I do. I'm sorry.

36:30.021 --> 36:34.014
But you are my sheriff.
Do with him as you please.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.355
You are free to go.

36:41.783 --> 36:45.071
-What?
-The human is free to go.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.363
And do not return.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.082
I fear it is not safe for you here.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.870
-This is a travesty.
-This is my verdict.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.803
-Make sure he leaves unharmed.
-Yes, Godric.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.642
Thank you. Thank you, sheriff.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.322
What was that about?

37:25.493 --> 37:27.905
Godric is sheriff
and he has the authority to--

37:28.079 --> 37:31.321
I mean with Eric. Why are you
talking to him if he kidnapped you?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.240
It wasn't Eric.

37:33.793 --> 37:36.535
-Then who was it?
-Mr. Compton.

37:36.713 --> 37:39.705
Hey, Sook. Is there someplace
we can talk in private?

37:39.883 --> 37:43.842
-Jason, this really isn't the time to--
-If I don't say this now, I never will.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.503
Look, please, it'll only take a minute.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.512
Let's go out back.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.432
Thanks.

37:51.936 --> 37:56.771
Listen, I know everyone says it,
but I'm really not the guy you want.

37:56.941 --> 38:01.355
If it's like you said, that there's something
out there that's fixing to get you...

38:01.821 --> 38:05.029
...then jail's just about the safest place
to spend the night.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.440
Now come on.

38:07.869 --> 38:10.861
Hey, Sam. Join the party.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.664
-What the--?
-|'d come down and give you a hug...

38:14.834 --> 38:16.210
...but I lost my pants.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.369
Yeah, it's been a hell of a night.
Must be a full moon.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.083
Pretty sure it's not.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.542
Mike?

38:23.051 --> 38:25.838
-What'd they arrest you for?
-Sodomy.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.173
-What?
-Yeah, they say |--

38:29.140 --> 38:30.880
l sodomized a pine tree.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.471
-What'd you do that for?
-I don't know.

38:34.979 --> 38:39.018
Must've blacked out, but it's gotta be true.
My pecker's got all kinds of scratches on.

38:42.695 --> 38:46.563
What are you in for?
Worse than me?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.065
Leave him alone, Mike.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.699
Sam?

38:52.205 --> 38:54.036
What is it?

38:54.666 --> 38:57.078
I need you to forgive me.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.625
What?

39:00.713 --> 39:01.964
You love my sister...

39:02.131 --> 39:06.249
...and there ain't no reason
why you shouldn't be able to.

39:07.095 --> 39:12.590
All this time, I let my own
stupid ignorance stand in the way.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.227
Thank you.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.854
But I am also in your debt
for helping rescue Sookie.

39:24.279 --> 39:29.069
After all I did to fuck everything up,
that's the least I can do.

39:30.743 --> 39:35.112
I'm just sorry it took me so long
to wake up to it.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.623
Well, you did. Just in time.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.392
Was that okay for you?

39:59.147 --> 40:00.478
It was fine.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.784
Hugo has been dispatched.

40:15.955 --> 40:19.743
I told him not to stop driving
until he reaches the Mexican border.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.872
l've arranged
for an AB-negative human for you.

40:24.047 --> 40:26.333
Extremely rare.

40:26.799 --> 40:27.834
Thank you.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.886
I'm not hungry.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.090
You have to feed eventually.

40:34.015 --> 40:37.428
I doubt the Fellowship
had anything to offer.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.850
Why wouldn't you leave
when | first came for you?

40:47.028 --> 40:49.440
They didn't treat me badly.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.318
You'd be shocked at how ordinary
most of them are.

40:53.493 --> 40:56.860
They do nothing but fan
the flames of hatred for us.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.370
Let's be honest.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.373
We are frightening.

41:04.045 --> 41:07.003
After thousands of years,
we haven't evolved.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.791
We've only grown more brutal...

41:11.511 --> 41:13.718
...more predatory.

41:16.516 --> 41:20.054
I don't see the danger
in treating humans as equals.

41:21.104 --> 41:25.143
The Fellowship of the Sun arose
because we never did so.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.735
Is that why you wouldn't fight
when they took you?

41:32.365 --> 41:35.983
I could have killed
every last one of them within minutes.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.244
And what would that have proven?

41:52.427 --> 41:55.840
Oh, my God.
| inhaled that fucker.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.596
You know what?

41:59.767 --> 42:03.976
I didn't think it was possible,
but this is better than her pot.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.933
Way better.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.223
I gotta learn how to cook.

42:08.818 --> 42:12.402
You know,
I feel like a superhero. I mean....

42:12.572 --> 42:14.108
You look like one.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.988
Yeah?

42:17.160 --> 42:18.696
How about now?

42:22.415 --> 42:24.451
I mean, I feel invincible, you know?

42:24.625 --> 42:26.286
Like nobody could even hurt me.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.293
Yeah?

42:29.839 --> 42:31.545
I hate you.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.297
I fucking hate your guts.

42:34.802 --> 42:38.090
You fucking bitch,
I fucking hate you too.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.972
You're not even trying, are you?

42:58.576 --> 42:59.611
More.

43:07.210 --> 43:10.498
Is that all you got? I mean--

43:16.928 --> 43:20.671
Now, that feels so fucking good.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.186
Damn, boy.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.525
Do it again.

43:42.995 --> 43:44.656
Fuck, I want you so bad.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.834
That's great. Me too.

44:37.008 --> 44:41.092
Hello there. I'm Lorena.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.340
Nice to meet you. I'm Sookie.

44:44.807 --> 44:48.345
Yes. You are what all the fuss is about.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.094
Excuse me?

44:51.564 --> 44:53.429
Aren't you a morsel?

44:54.775 --> 44:57.061
I'm sorry. Who are you?

44:58.070 --> 45:01.062
Well, we have a mutual friend.

45:01.449 --> 45:03.110
-Bill?
-That's right.

45:03.618 --> 45:05.609
Funny he never mentioned me.

45:05.786 --> 45:09.119
l practically made him what he is today.

45:09.290 --> 45:12.703
-Lorena!
-Oh, hello, darling.

45:12.877 --> 45:15.584
l was just getting to know
your plaything.

45:15.755 --> 45:17.962
You always did like to prey
on the innocent.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.464
Bill, is this your maker?

45:20.635 --> 45:24.799
She released me years ago.
She no longer has any hold over me.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.054
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.136
We had two marvelous nights
in your room.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.299
What?

45:30.478 --> 45:32.969
Did you know your boyfriend
hit me over the head...

45:33.147 --> 45:37.060
...with a 52-inch plasma television
earlier tonight?

45:37.235 --> 45:40.193
Everyone says they're so thin and light,
but let me tell you...

45:40.363 --> 45:42.820
...when wielded properly,
it's quite a weapon.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.696
-You did?
-Lorena, you need to leave.

45:44.867 --> 45:48.155
I hope he doesn't pull the same
shenanigans with you.

45:48.329 --> 45:51.241
There's no excuse for domestic violence.

45:51.415 --> 45:55.909
What she has failed to mention
is that she was holding me prisoner.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.999
We were just catching up is all.

45:59.340 --> 46:03.333
You must have been worried sick,
wondering where he was.

46:04.637 --> 46:08.346
I admit it got a bit heated...

46:08.683 --> 46:11.299
...but you know how old lovers
can get sometimes.

46:11.477 --> 46:13.092
Do not touch him.

46:15.856 --> 46:19.440
My, we're feisty too.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.696
You're no more than a blood bag.

46:30.037 --> 46:33.746
-You cannot win this.
-|'ve already won.

46:33.916 --> 46:39.707
Bill chose me,
and yet you still won't give up.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.963
-Don't you have any shame?
-Sookie, stop.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.841
I'd listen to him.

46:46.721 --> 46:49.303
Run away, little girl.

46:49.849 --> 46:52.010
William and I love each other.

46:52.184 --> 46:54.391
You've gone mad. Now, get out now.

46:54.562 --> 46:56.894
Maybe you do love him.
Who am | to guess?

46:57.648 --> 47:02.358
But he doesn't love you.
He never has, and that we both know.

47:04.363 --> 47:07.355
Take those words back
or they shall be your last.

47:07.533 --> 47:10.149
-We're leaving.
-Go find someone else, you fucking bitch!

47:10.328 --> 47:12.034
You've lost this one!

47:20.588 --> 47:24.581
Retract your fangs.

47:26.052 --> 47:27.588
Now.

47:33.642 --> 47:39.182
l neither know nor care who you are...

47:39.732 --> 47:45.728
...but in this area, and certainly
in this nest, I am the authority.

47:47.656 --> 47:49.442
Do you understand?

47:50.534 --> 47:52.525
Yes, sheriff.

48:00.836 --> 48:02.292
This human has proven herself...

48:02.463 --> 48:07.924
...to be a courageous
and loyal friend to our kind.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.756
And yet you treat her
like a child does a dragonfly...

48:11.931 --> 48:14.422
...pulling off wings for sport.

48:15.476 --> 48:17.637
No wonder they hate us.

48:18.437 --> 48:20.052
She provoked me.

48:21.107 --> 48:23.393
And you provoke me.

48:23.651 --> 48:26.734
You disrupted the peace
in my own home.

48:27.530 --> 48:29.896
I could snap you like a twig.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.778
Yet I haven't.

48:34.787 --> 48:36.152
Now, why is that?

48:38.999 --> 48:42.127
It's your choice.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.080
Indeed it is.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.164
You're an old vampire. I can tell.

48:49.301 --> 48:53.465
You've had hundreds of years
to better yourself, yet you haven't.

48:54.223 --> 48:58.637
You are still a savage,
and I fear for all of us...

48:58.811 --> 49:02.099
...humans and vampires...

49:03.190 --> 49:05.101
...if this behavior persists.

49:06.152 --> 49:07.358
You.

49:08.362 --> 49:10.444
You seem to know her.

49:12.533 --> 49:14.524
Yes, sheriff.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.489
Escort her from the nest.

49:19.206 --> 49:21.822
Go ahead. I'm fine.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.330
| wish you out of my area before dawn.

49:36.182 --> 49:40.050
I don't know how it got this way.

49:40.227 --> 49:42.889
I can't help that I still love you.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.562
You know I do.

49:47.067 --> 49:53.734
But now it's become nothing
but a constant humiliation.

49:57.578 --> 50:01.696
The pain that you suffer
you've inflicted upon yourself.

50:04.877 --> 50:08.085
When will we see each other again?

50:13.636 --> 50:17.595
-Never.
-We're immortal.

50:18.307 --> 50:21.515
Our paths are bound to cross eventually.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.270
l have him by the neck, shaking.

50:27.066 --> 50:31.935
But it's kind of funny
you say that because...

50:53.759 --> 50:55.624
Luke?

50:56.136 --> 50:57.876
What the fuck, man?

50:58.639 --> 51:00.800
Stay away from me.
Got nothing to say to you.

51:00.975 --> 51:04.138
-What the hell you doing?
-Just go.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.522
Excuse me, everyone.

51:14.738 --> 51:16.774
If I could have your attention.

51:18.409 --> 51:21.071
My name is Luke McDonald.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.869
I'm a member of
the Fellowship of the Sun...

51:24.039 --> 51:28.749
...and l have a message for you all
from Reverend Steve Newlin.
