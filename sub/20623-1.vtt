WEBVTT

01:04.474 --> 01:05.905
Andy, are you ready?

01:05.911 --> 01:07.251
Get up here.

01:07.246 --> 01:09.536
I'm done with my boat, mom.

01:09.562 --> 01:13.022
We're gonna be
late to the airport.

01:13.018 --> 01:14.548
Please bring your bag down.

01:14.553 --> 01:17.263
I can't find it.

01:17.256 --> 01:20.986
Did you look under your bed?

01:21.892 --> 01:24.892
What are you doing up there?

01:27.965 --> 01:29.895
Babe you got the passports?

01:29.901 --> 01:32.671
Yeah, I got them.

01:34.605 --> 01:36.965
Daddy, daddy look.

01:37.975 --> 01:40.335
Yeah it looks good,
the sail looks great.

01:40.345 --> 01:44.775
You almost got it. That's good.

01:44.783 --> 01:48.693
I checked the weather,
not a drop of rain all week.

01:48.687 --> 01:50.427
I know, that's great. Hello.
Can you take the luggage out?

01:50.454 --> 01:52.024
Honey, can you guys take the
luggage outside, please?

01:52.024 --> 01:57.504
- Andy where's your bag?
- I was saying, he has to...

01:57.496 --> 02:00.796
Andy. Where's your bag, sweetie?

02:00.799 --> 02:03.069
Yeah, I saw the X-ray.

02:03.068 --> 02:05.698
Well, schedule an mri
and let's just wait

02:05.704 --> 02:07.344
to see what the results
of the blood test are

02:07.339 --> 02:10.439
and we'll talk next week, okay?
Email me his results.

02:10.442 --> 02:12.542
Yeah, thank you. All right.

02:12.544 --> 02:13.844
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

02:13.845 --> 02:15.375
Are we gonna go on jet skis?

02:15.380 --> 02:16.950
Because Colin said
he went on a lake

02:16.948 --> 02:18.848
and his dad let him
drive a jet ski.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.890
Six year old Colin rode
a jet ski by himself?

02:21.887 --> 02:23.787
He went 100 miles per hour.

02:23.789 --> 02:25.459
And he also said
that his dad can

02:25.457 --> 02:27.457
kick your ass because
you're a doctor.

02:27.459 --> 02:31.929
First of all do not repeat
bad words after Colin.

02:31.930 --> 02:36.330
Secondly, doctors are pretty
tough, you'd be surprised.

02:36.335 --> 02:39.795
And I highly doubt Colin
rode a jet ski by himself.

02:39.805 --> 02:42.335
Then promise me we
will go together then.

02:42.341 --> 02:43.641
I promise.

02:43.642 --> 02:47.382
Kevin, Andy,
so you're finally leaving.

02:47.379 --> 02:48.569
Lucas, yeah.

02:48.571 --> 02:52.051
Jules found a really
good deal in the Caribbean.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.350
We're gonna spend some
quality time with the family.

02:54.353 --> 02:56.123
That's what vacations are for.

02:56.121 --> 03:00.591
And only because of you, Margie and I were
able to spend our last vacation together.

03:00.592 --> 03:05.402
I know, I know, it's okay,
you don't have to thank me.

03:05.397 --> 03:08.377
By the way Julie mentioned you
can't start the lawnmower again.

03:08.404 --> 03:10.804
I'll tell you what, i could
show you how to fix it.

03:10.802 --> 03:12.602
It's simple,
it'll only take a second.

03:12.604 --> 03:14.814
It's a small engine,
and they're all the same.

03:14.806 --> 03:17.066
I'm... I'm on vacation.

03:17.075 --> 03:19.105
I'm not fixing
anything right now.

03:19.111 --> 03:22.111
Andy your father
can fix a human heart

03:22.114 --> 03:25.254
but he can't fix the lawnmower.

03:26.585 --> 03:31.085
Be careful, some areas are
not very safe out there.

03:31.089 --> 03:33.159
Thanks, Lucas,
I'll keep that in mind.

03:33.158 --> 03:35.488
- Toodle-loo.
- Have a nice week.

03:35.494 --> 03:38.704
Kevin, slip the
concierge a little

03:38.697 --> 03:41.467
something extra
he'll upgrade your room.

03:41.466 --> 03:46.436
Money... that's how
everything works down there.

03:47.438 --> 03:49.838
Okay. Thanks.

03:49.841 --> 03:51.081
Au revoir.

03:51.076 --> 03:55.036
Daddy, what's a concierge?

04:06.023 --> 04:09.163
Daddy, is treasure island real?

04:12.129 --> 04:16.539
Yeah, for sure, hundreds
of years ago pirates

04:16.569 --> 04:20.668
used to hide treasure
on deserted islands.

04:20.672 --> 04:23.042
Why?

04:23.041 --> 04:26.481
So no one else could
figure out where they hid it.

04:26.478 --> 04:29.578
Why didn't they keep their treasure
at home with their families?

04:29.581 --> 04:33.621
Pirates don't have,
homes, you know, or families.

04:33.618 --> 04:36.818
If they didn't
have homes or family

04:36.822 --> 04:39.862
why did they need treasure?

04:42.694 --> 04:45.434
That's a good question.

05:05.516 --> 05:08.576
Hey, come here.

05:10.221 --> 05:11.661
What do you think?

05:11.656 --> 05:12.956
It's pretty amazing.

05:12.958 --> 05:16.828
It is pretty good. Yeah.
Welcome. Hi.

05:16.828 --> 05:19.598
May I have your name and
reservation number please?

05:19.598 --> 05:21.428
Kevin Riley.

05:23.501 --> 05:25.701
I don't think I'm really
particularly good at this

05:25.704 --> 05:28.874
but if you were willing
to upgrade our room,

05:28.874 --> 05:35.114
I would be willing to compensate
you, personally, financially.

05:35.113 --> 05:37.653
Certainly, let's see
what we have available.

05:37.649 --> 05:39.379
Thanks, man.

05:40.718 --> 05:44.188
So what do you think
of the honeymoon suite?

05:44.189 --> 05:46.689
It's pretty great,
nice to finally see one.

05:46.691 --> 05:50.561
Come on.
Our honeymoon suite was nice.

05:50.562 --> 05:52.662
I'm sorry our honeymoon suite
did you just say?

05:52.664 --> 05:56.104
Our honeymoon suite was a tiny bed in
the back of an rv on the way to Mexico.

05:56.101 --> 05:58.241
So? That sounds like fun,
it was great.

05:58.236 --> 06:00.676
It was the worst trip
ever, that's what that is.

06:00.701 --> 06:02.001
I thought it was fun.

06:06.544 --> 06:10.684
I know you did. Love you.

06:32.636 --> 06:34.566
- Hi, there.
- Good morning, how are you doing?

06:34.573 --> 06:36.073
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

06:36.074 --> 06:37.174
How can I help you today? I
want to get a jet ski, please.

06:37.175 --> 06:44.245
Man, yep, I'm sorry
but we're all out for today.

06:44.249 --> 06:47.179
You know the list is full,
so sorry.

06:47.185 --> 06:49.645
Actually, if you can give me your
name I can book you for tomorrow.

06:49.654 --> 06:52.364
No I get it,
i get it, that's cool.

06:52.357 --> 06:55.327
Sir, sir we don't...
Sir, we don't have any jet skis.

06:55.327 --> 06:58.097
Okay, my son,
he's never been on one before

06:58.096 --> 07:00.056
and I swear to you
it's all he talks about.

07:00.065 --> 07:01.895
So if there's anything that
you could do it would be great.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.530
It would mean a lot to me.

07:04.201 --> 07:05.671
I'm not... you know what, I'm not
even supposed to tell you this

07:05.670 --> 07:10.310
but... but you can rent a
motorboat from one of the locals.

07:10.308 --> 07:12.778
A couple of kilometers down
you'll see a bunch of guys

07:12.777 --> 07:16.047
and they have all kinds
of boats, all right?

07:19.316 --> 07:20.616
Hey, mister.

07:20.619 --> 07:22.619
What you got there?

07:22.621 --> 07:26.921
- Five dollar fish.
- No, thanks, nice fish though.

07:26.925 --> 07:28.685
Yo, my friend, you need a boat?

07:28.693 --> 07:30.233
- Yeah.
- Only 300, bro.

07:30.228 --> 07:32.098
- Which one?
- Right there the white one.

07:32.097 --> 07:33.797
Right here, my man.
The fastest boat is right here.

07:33.798 --> 07:35.628
Yeah, right, give me 250.

07:35.634 --> 07:36.054
Three hours for $200.

07:36.072 --> 07:36.992
Give me 250. Come here,
you gonna like it.

07:36.992 --> 07:38.002
Right here, right here come on.
Just give me 250.

07:38.022 --> 07:38.902
Come on, come right here.
- He says 200.

07:38.903 --> 07:42.673
Fun boat, you're gonna love it.

07:42.674 --> 07:44.914
- Go ahead.
- Thanks, man.

07:44.909 --> 07:47.079
- I like this one.
- How you doing, sir?

07:47.078 --> 07:50.748
- I'm good, how are you?
- Fine, this is a good boat, man.

07:50.749 --> 07:52.419
- This is the fastest boat ever, okay?
- Okay.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.887
That engine right
there 60 horsepower.

07:54.886 --> 07:56.416
- Okay.
- It came from a old sport boat.

07:56.421 --> 08:00.861
- All right.
- Just $200 for three hours, cash please.

08:00.859 --> 08:03.009
Thank you very much.
- You need my license?

08:03.038 --> 08:06.198
Get in, come on, no man, i don't
need your license, come on.

08:06.197 --> 08:08.267
Okay. -What you gonna do,
you gonna steal my boat?

08:08.266 --> 08:11.296
Maybe. -You can take it,
I'll get insurance money.

08:13.938 --> 08:18.998
Don't worry, man, just bring it clean and I'm
not gonna charge you a cleaning fee, okay?

08:19.021 --> 08:22.181
So sit down, I'm gonna
show you how it works, okay?

08:22.180 --> 08:25.750
Okay, very simple okay,
put the gear in drive.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.720
And you're gonna put the throttle control
lever up and that's it you're ready to go.

08:27.719 --> 08:31.059
- Okay.
- You got the life vests right there, okay.

08:31.056 --> 08:32.716
And make sure if you got kids
put them on them. - Okay.

08:32.724 --> 08:36.764
And you got a full
tank of gas, be safe.

08:38.294 --> 08:39.995
Now remember if you go swimming,

08:39.998 --> 08:42.097
remember to drop
the anchor, okay?

08:42.100 --> 08:45.440
'Cause when you come back you're not
gonna see the boat again, okay.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.367
Have a good trip.

09:17.101 --> 09:18.801
You can steer it, here we go.

09:18.803 --> 09:21.213
- Babe.
- Yeah?

09:21.206 --> 09:22.766
Where did you find this thing?

09:22.774 --> 09:26.144
Well they didn't have any jet skis
but the good thing is this is safer

09:26.144 --> 09:30.484
and we're all together, right?

09:33.218 --> 09:35.388
I see how it is.

09:35.386 --> 09:39.786
These guys think
they can take us

09:39.791 --> 09:42.261
What do you say we show
them what we can do?

09:42.260 --> 09:43.890
- Buckle up.
- Do it.

09:43.895 --> 09:46.395
Yeah, faster, daddy, faster.

09:48.833 --> 09:52.233
Bet you Colin
never went this fast.

10:19.863 --> 10:22.973
Kevin. Kevin!

10:22.967 --> 10:25.437
- Yeah?
- Slow down.

10:25.436 --> 10:27.166
Okay.

10:27.172 --> 10:29.172
Babe, listen, I think
we should go back.

10:29.174 --> 10:31.014
We can't even see
the land anymore.

10:31.009 --> 10:35.579
- No.
- Yeah, we got two hours left, come on.

10:35.580 --> 10:39.050
I think it's gonna take us a while
to get back. We should turn around.

10:39.050 --> 10:40.880
All right, you know
what your mom is right.

10:40.885 --> 10:43.315
- Let's turn this baby around and we'll...
- Sorry.

10:43.321 --> 10:45.891
Cruise around closer
to shore, okay?

10:45.890 --> 10:47.930
- No.
- I know, buddy, I'm sorry.

10:47.926 --> 10:50.856
I don't mean to
be a party pooper.

10:50.862 --> 10:52.832
It's safer.

10:53.430 --> 10:56.170
Island, island,
i wanna see the island.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.897
Daddy, treasure island.

10:58.903 --> 11:00.203
I don't think it's a good idea.

11:00.205 --> 11:04.335
Mom, just for a minute,
can we see the island?

11:04.342 --> 11:05.912
What do you say, mom?

11:05.910 --> 11:08.480
It's not every day you get
to see a deserted island.

11:08.479 --> 11:11.249
Why don't we just check it out? And
we'll go home and have lunch after.

11:11.249 --> 11:13.319
Yeah!

11:14.017 --> 11:16.587
Mom, please, please, please?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.858
Okay.

11:18.857 --> 11:24.627
Yeah, full speed ahead!
Next stop treasure island!

11:42.112 --> 11:44.582
Daddy, look, palm trees.

11:44.582 --> 11:45.952
They're everywhere.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.450
Awesome.

11:47.452 --> 11:48.622
Come here your ears are red.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.490
Dad you think
there's treasure here?

11:50.488 --> 11:52.618
You never know.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.894
You guys wanna take a
walk around the island?

11:54.893 --> 11:58.903
I think I'm gonna sit down and read
for a little bit, you guys go ahead.

11:58.897 --> 12:00.027
All right.

12:00.031 --> 12:02.931
Let's look for a buried treasure.
All right, well, let's do it.

12:02.934 --> 12:04.534
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

12:04.535 --> 12:06.935
You boys have fun.

12:06.938 --> 12:10.368
Let's do it, come on,
let's find some treasure.

12:10.398 --> 12:12.018
What do you think?

12:12.044 --> 12:13.694
Awesome. Let's
go see this thing.

12:13.717 --> 12:16.207
Let's see if we can make
it all the way around.

12:16.214 --> 12:17.854
Cool.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.364
Whoa, a seashell.

12:28.292 --> 12:30.392
Dad, look.

12:30.395 --> 12:33.295
Wow, that's pretty cool.

12:33.298 --> 12:37.728
Take a look inside,
see if anybody's home.

12:56.086 --> 12:58.086
Hello, darlings.

12:59.423 --> 13:01.063
Look, mom, we found
a cool seashell.

13:01.059 --> 13:03.289
Ooh a conk shell,
it's good luck you know.

13:03.294 --> 13:06.564
- Conk, can you say conk?
- Conk.

13:06.564 --> 13:09.974
Conk shell,
it's good luck, you ready?

13:09.968 --> 13:13.698
- I'm hungry.
- Hungry, too.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.865
Let me help you up.

13:16.707 --> 13:19.707
- Who wants Sushi?
- I want Sushi.

13:19.711 --> 13:24.111
Okay, how about,

13:24.115 --> 13:28.145
what do you say we get
mom a caterpillar roll?

13:30.254 --> 13:32.524
Or a spider roll?

13:32.523 --> 13:33.993
What about a tarantula roll?

13:33.992 --> 13:37.462
What, no those are too hairy,
i don't like those.

13:37.462 --> 13:41.632
How about some,
start with some miso chorizo?

13:41.632 --> 13:43.632
Miso chorizo?

13:43.634 --> 13:46.174
Or some edamame salami?

13:51.008 --> 13:53.038
I don't think
there's a crab there.

13:53.044 --> 13:55.614
Yeah, probably not.
What's going on over there, hon?

14:04.087 --> 14:06.487
We run out of gas?

14:09.526 --> 14:13.156
- No, it's full.
- Okay.

14:15.766 --> 14:18.796
I think that's
supposed to be down.

14:21.438 --> 14:23.108
All right, come on.

14:29.813 --> 14:32.113
Come on, come on.

14:40.057 --> 14:42.087
I mean, anyways
if anything there's...

14:42.093 --> 14:45.163
There's got to be a bunch
of boats around.

14:59.109 --> 15:00.779
There we go.

15:03.647 --> 15:07.517
It's basically a
lawnmower engine.

15:15.092 --> 15:18.062
Fuck, come on, come on.

15:38.482 --> 15:40.922
It won't be much longer, honey.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.830
All right, so how long do you think
before they notice the boat is missing

15:52.830 --> 15:54.400
and they come looking for us?

15:54.398 --> 15:58.438
I don't know if they care
if the boat is missing.

15:58.436 --> 16:02.206
I rented it from a
local and paid in cash.

16:02.206 --> 16:07.176
He doesn't know my name
or where we're staying.

16:07.178 --> 16:12.548
And he wouldn't want to report
his missing boat to the police?

16:12.550 --> 16:14.580
I hope he does.

16:19.723 --> 16:22.893
Look, if it comes down to it,

16:22.894 --> 16:25.234
I'll put on a life vest
and I'll swim back.

16:25.229 --> 16:29.169
You can't swim back, it took us an hour going whatever
miles per hour we were doing to get out here.

16:29.167 --> 16:33.067
Can you even imagine
how far out we are?

16:38.241 --> 16:42.981
I'm gonna keep looking for
boats on the other side.

18:04.327 --> 18:06.657
You okay?

18:06.696 --> 18:08.626
Only battery's dead.

18:08.633 --> 18:11.333
I've been messing with the engine
all morning and it seems fine.

18:11.335 --> 18:12.735
The fuel line's good,
we got fuel.

18:12.737 --> 18:14.437
The engine's just... i
don't know.

18:14.438 --> 18:15.968
I think it's the
battery that's dead.

18:15.973 --> 18:21.413
I went around the island,
i didn't see any water.

18:23.046 --> 18:27.416
I did see a boat
a little while ago.

18:27.418 --> 18:31.288
Mommy, my head hurts
and I'm thirsty.

18:31.289 --> 18:34.519
I know, sweetheart, but you
have to stay out of the sun.

18:34.525 --> 18:36.885
Your father's asked you twice
to stay out of the sun.

18:36.894 --> 18:38.934
It's okay. It's okay.

18:39.863 --> 18:41.463
Hey, chief.

18:44.501 --> 18:47.541
Everything's gonna be fine.

18:47.538 --> 18:50.868
Just like in the pirate stories.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.405
Did you know that when they
used to sail these seas

18:53.411 --> 18:56.651
they would go for weeks
at a time without food?

18:56.647 --> 19:00.677
And they didn't mind because
it was... it was an adventure.

19:00.685 --> 19:02.045
Just like it is for us.

19:02.053 --> 19:06.793
So I want you to do what your mom says
and I want you to stay under that tree

19:06.817 --> 19:10.777
and stay out of the sun and I want
you to think about what you're

19:10.800 --> 19:14.880
gonna tell Colin about your big
adventure on treasure island, okay?

19:15.432 --> 19:17.402
Okay?

19:19.502 --> 19:25.342
Look, boat, boat.
Come on, boat. Hey!

19:25.343 --> 19:28.613
- Babe, boat, yo.
- Hey!

19:28.612 --> 19:31.052
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

19:31.048 --> 19:34.078
- Stop.
- Whoo, help!

19:34.085 --> 19:36.885
- Stop!
- Stop, help.

19:36.887 --> 19:38.387
- Help us.
- Hey!

19:38.389 --> 19:41.489
- We need help.
- Whoo, help!

19:41.492 --> 19:44.862
- See us!
- Help, hey!

19:44.862 --> 19:47.132
Look over here!

19:47.131 --> 19:50.971
Hey, whoo!

19:54.137 --> 19:56.807
Hey, come here, it's okay.

19:56.807 --> 19:59.377
There's gonna be plenty more.

19:59.377 --> 20:01.107
That's just one.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.752
A boat is gonna come along
and they're gonna get us okay?

20:03.748 --> 20:05.918
Now in the meantime,
you get under that palm tree.

20:05.916 --> 20:07.546
Stay out of the sun.

20:13.790 --> 20:16.830
What are we gonna do?

20:17.427 --> 20:21.027
Well, we can last a couple
of days without food.

20:21.031 --> 20:23.401
Someone's guaranteed
to come by then.

20:23.401 --> 20:27.041
How long can we
last without water?

21:03.006 --> 21:07.306
I can't believe,
this is actually happening.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.880
Hey.

21:17.687 --> 21:21.057
I know I've been
too hard on you.

21:22.992 --> 21:25.162
I'm sorry.

21:27.030 --> 21:29.930
Do you really think
we're gonna be okay?

21:29.934 --> 21:33.244
Of course we're gonna be okay.

21:35.905 --> 21:39.175
I will not let us die out here.

21:39.176 --> 21:41.506
That's a promise.

22:39.002 --> 22:40.972
Jules...

22:41.037 --> 22:44.937
Jules, Jules.

22:44.942 --> 22:46.982
Jules, you got to wake up.

22:46.977 --> 22:50.607
His heart is racing,
he's overcompensating

22:50.614 --> 22:52.224
'cause he can't pump
the blood properly.

22:52.216 --> 22:55.476
Andy, Andy!

22:57.887 --> 23:01.157
Damn it, goddamn it.

23:07.131 --> 23:12.131
Please don't let him die,
we have to do something.

23:13.736 --> 23:15.336
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:15.339 --> 23:18.939
Hey, we have to
get off the island.

23:18.943 --> 23:22.053
We have to get out on the water.

23:22.046 --> 23:23.776
<i>There are boats out there.</i>

23:23.781 --> 23:26.321
<i>Someone is gonna spot us.</i>

23:26.317 --> 23:29.747
<i>If we don't he's not
gonna wake up tomorrow.</i>

23:29.753 --> 23:32.023
<i>None of us will.</i>

23:39.295 --> 23:41.325
Baby, I'm sorry.

23:43.633 --> 23:44.873
I love you.

23:44.868 --> 23:47.368
I love you.

26:53.222 --> 26:57.232
Hello! Help!

26:57.227 --> 26:59.887
Help, help!

27:01.497 --> 27:05.497
Help, help, help!

27:05.502 --> 27:10.512
Help, help, help!

27:44.273 --> 27:47.513
My son and my wife
they need water.

27:47.511 --> 27:52.351
Here, here, wet their lips.

27:52.349 --> 27:53.879
With what?

27:53.884 --> 27:55.854
It's fresh water.

27:59.622 --> 28:01.762
Jules.

28:03.559 --> 28:05.629
Come here.

28:05.629 --> 28:07.629
Come here.

28:08.564 --> 28:10.974
I got water there.

28:12.001 --> 28:15.871
No, no, put it on her neck,
put it on her neck.

28:15.873 --> 28:19.143
The skin is thin there,
it'll suck in the moisture.

28:19.142 --> 28:21.312
I'm a doctor.

28:23.579 --> 28:26.919
Exactly. Okay.

28:26.917 --> 28:30.317
Now get her wrist,
get her wrist.

28:34.891 --> 28:37.991
Come on, water.

28:45.101 --> 28:48.741
We have water, we've got water.

28:53.943 --> 28:55.483
How long you been out here?

28:55.479 --> 28:56.549
A few days.

28:56.546 --> 28:58.246
- Days?
- Days.

28:58.248 --> 29:02.688
What happened? We're staying at
a resort and I rented this boat

29:02.686 --> 29:06.586
and then the engine
just wouldn't start.

29:06.590 --> 29:08.620
Drifted out to sea and...

29:08.625 --> 29:10.585
But my son I need to
get him to the hospital.

29:10.594 --> 29:14.104
He won't last much longer,
please.

29:14.097 --> 29:17.097
Let me take the kid.

29:30.413 --> 29:34.353
Come on, babe, we're going home.

30:30.206 --> 30:34.076
I'm... I'm Kevin,
this is my wife, Julie.

30:34.077 --> 30:39.477
And I just want to say we're gonna be forever
grateful for what you've done for us.

30:42.018 --> 30:43.788
What is your name?

30:43.787 --> 30:47.717
Listen, man, i want to help you.

30:47.724 --> 30:50.064
I want to save you
and your family, okay?

30:50.060 --> 30:51.230
Okay.

30:51.228 --> 30:52.658
But I would like
a reward, you know,

30:52.662 --> 30:55.262
a compensation for
saving your lives.

30:55.265 --> 30:58.725
Yes, of course, definitely.

30:58.735 --> 31:01.565
I swear to you
you'll be very happy.

31:01.571 --> 31:06.511
Yeah, but I would like to
agree on the price right now.

31:10.579 --> 31:14.019
Of... of course,
anything you want.

31:16.753 --> 31:24.753
Ten... thousand.

31:28.297 --> 31:31.697
Forty, forty, that's everything
that we have in our savings.

31:31.701 --> 31:34.171
I'll give you $40,000.

31:35.271 --> 31:39.141
How much is your
family's life worth?

31:40.409 --> 31:43.539
I want one million dollars.

31:45.214 --> 31:46.904
I don't... I don't
have a million dollars.

31:46.926 --> 31:48.116
But you're a doctor right?

31:48.118 --> 31:51.818
Yes, I'm a doctor but i
work at a county hospital.

31:51.822 --> 31:55.692
We don't even make
anything like that.

31:58.327 --> 32:01.657
Listen, man,
i have a family, too.

32:01.665 --> 32:06.535
Y'all come down here and
spend $10,000 on one vacation.

32:06.536 --> 32:11.766
That's more than I made this
whole year, for four people.

32:11.775 --> 32:13.475
I need a million
dollars or I'm leaving.

32:13.477 --> 32:16.807
- Make up your mind.
- No, no, you can't leave us.

32:16.813 --> 32:19.323
You can't leave us,
you can't be serious.

32:19.316 --> 32:20.546
We'll die out here.

32:20.575 --> 32:24.245
You said you have a family,
and I've offered you $40,000.

32:24.254 --> 32:26.624
$40,000, isn't that enough?

32:26.623 --> 32:29.163
Not for me. -Wait, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

32:29.159 --> 32:31.459
- Please don't go.
- One million dollars or no deal.

32:31.461 --> 32:34.481
Wait, wait, wait, you can't
leave my family here.

32:34.504 --> 32:36.234
One million
dollars or no deal.

32:36.233 --> 32:39.273
I don't have a million dollars.

32:39.269 --> 32:43.599
My son is six years
old you motherfucker.

32:55.351 --> 32:57.751
You can die here.

32:57.754 --> 33:00.194
Or we can go to town.

33:00.856 --> 33:04.326
Call one of your rich
friends get my money

33:04.327 --> 33:06.157
and your family lives.

33:06.163 --> 33:08.803
I'll get money,
just get us off the island

33:08.798 --> 33:10.168
and I'll get you
a million dollars.

33:10.167 --> 33:11.697
- You sure?
- Yeah.

33:11.701 --> 33:13.601
Good.

34:17.565 --> 34:19.726
Wake up.

34:35.484 --> 34:39.994
Where's my... where's my wife,
and my... and my son?

34:41.322 --> 34:43.163
My son?

34:45.293 --> 34:47.704
Back on the island.

34:48.764 --> 34:51.004
Why? We agreed.

34:51.001 --> 34:56.341
Listen to me. We have to go to
the bank and transfer the money.

34:56.339 --> 35:01.219
And then we go back to the island with the
second boat so you can get your family.

35:01.246 --> 35:03.276
But they don't have any water.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.720
They had enough water,
listen carefully.

35:07.717 --> 35:11.347
Think about your family,
your family is on the line.

35:11.354 --> 35:14.424
You do anything stupid your
family's gonna die okay?

35:14.424 --> 35:16.564
- Why are you doing this?
- By the morning they're gonna die.

35:16.559 --> 35:19.329
- Shut the fuck up.
- Don't do anything stupid.

35:19.329 --> 35:21.359
Don't tell the police
or anyone else,

35:21.364 --> 35:23.934
because if you do
i won't tell anyone anything.

35:23.933 --> 35:27.303
I will say this guy is a liar.

35:27.304 --> 35:29.574
Turn around go back, please.

35:29.572 --> 35:31.342
Turn around and go back, please.

35:31.341 --> 35:33.881
I swear to god,
I'll still pay you the money.

35:33.877 --> 35:37.377
Just take me back, please. I swear to
god I'll still give you the money.

35:37.380 --> 35:39.350
I'll give you the money!

35:39.349 --> 35:42.449
Let's make sure you do that.

36:13.048 --> 36:16.418
So I'm in town
and I'm coming right now.

36:16.419 --> 36:19.119
Okay, alright.

36:19.122 --> 36:23.362
Just make sure you text me
the account number right away.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.090
Yeah.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.764
Okay, good.

36:35.871 --> 36:40.541
All right, don't mess with me,
man, I'm on the way right now.

36:41.076 --> 36:42.976
Jorge!

36:45.080 --> 36:47.050
Bye.

36:56.959 --> 37:00.759
There are thousands
of islands back there.

37:00.764 --> 37:04.874
I am the only one
who knows where your family is.

37:04.868 --> 37:07.798
So don't do anything stupid.

37:11.740 --> 37:14.840
Here, clean up.

37:20.916 --> 37:22.176
Jimmy, it's Kevin.

37:22.185 --> 37:24.715
I'm in a lot of trouble,
i need money today.

37:24.721 --> 37:29.491
I don't even have time to talk about this right now
but you have to do something for me immediately.

37:29.492 --> 37:32.092
I can't tell you right now.
It's about Andy and Julie.

37:32.095 --> 37:33.925
Just wire it.

37:33.930 --> 37:38.270
You have my bank information,
just get it to me.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.507
Put me in with
Dr. zett's office, please.

37:44.507 --> 37:47.437
Can't talk about it right now,
I'm in a bad situation.

37:47.444 --> 37:52.214
What do you mean? Nine zero
five six four nine eight three.

37:52.215 --> 37:55.915
Hello, can you hear me?
I need money.

37:55.919 --> 38:00.219
No, no, no, no, not next week,
it has to be now.

38:00.223 --> 38:02.193
Richard, Richard, Richard,
I've been waiting

38:02.192 --> 38:04.632
on the phone for
you for ten minutes.

38:04.627 --> 38:06.557
Ten minutes I've been
sitting here waiting for you.

38:06.563 --> 38:10.233
No, no, no, no, no,
i cannot wait.

38:10.233 --> 38:11.533
I cannot wait!

38:11.534 --> 38:12.804
Yes!

38:12.802 --> 38:17.402
Get him on the phone,
get him on the phone!

38:18.607 --> 38:20.337
Fuck!

38:25.180 --> 38:29.180
Lucas, Lucas, it's... it's
Kevin, can you hear me?

38:29.185 --> 38:31.215
Listen, I know that
you always said that

38:31.221 --> 38:35.161
you wanted to repay me
for what I did for Margie.

38:35.158 --> 38:37.418
Well, now's the day.

38:39.194 --> 38:41.264
Take me to the bank.

38:54.877 --> 38:56.977
How can I help you?

38:56.980 --> 38:59.980
I need to check my account.

39:00.949 --> 39:02.149
Can I have your card?

39:02.151 --> 39:04.391
Thank you, Mr. Riley.

39:27.276 --> 39:31.346
Anything else I can
do for you today?

39:36.118 --> 39:38.048
Have a good day.

39:42.090 --> 39:43.330
This wasn't the deal.

39:43.326 --> 39:46.596
You can either take that money
now or you can take nothing!

39:46.596 --> 39:48.626
If you don't take my money,

39:48.631 --> 39:53.141
if you don't tell me where
my wife and my child are,

39:53.136 --> 39:56.146
you're gonna be looking over your
shoulder for the rest of your

39:56.176 --> 39:59.306
short, agonizing, miserable life,
because I'm gonna take your face

39:59.309 --> 40:00.939
and break it in half with my

40:00.944 --> 40:04.214
fucking hands you understand me?

40:13.722 --> 40:15.922
I need to know that
we have a deal.

40:15.925 --> 40:17.655
Transfer it.

40:17.660 --> 40:19.590
Anything else?

40:20.195 --> 40:22.055
Thank you.

40:23.865 --> 40:25.595
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

40:25.602 --> 40:28.102
I want to transfer to
that account number please.

40:28.104 --> 40:30.374
- The whole amount?
- The entire balance.

40:30.373 --> 40:32.143
Sure thing.

40:36.111 --> 40:41.521
Yeah. Wired two minutes ago,
you got it?

40:41.950 --> 40:45.290
Okay, okay, we're good.

40:45.621 --> 40:47.391
Okay, it's good.

40:53.696 --> 40:56.256
Okay, come.

41:29.698 --> 41:32.398
You can follow us in this one.

41:39.274 --> 41:42.314
Hey, why are you locking me in? Okay,
for your own safety and everyone's.

41:42.311 --> 41:43.851
Don't communicate with anyone.

41:43.846 --> 41:45.446
- Open... open the door!
- Listen, listen.

41:45.448 --> 41:47.678
When we get to the
island I will let you out

41:47.684 --> 41:49.384
but first you have
to wait one hour

41:49.385 --> 41:50.745
after we leave, then you leave.

41:50.753 --> 41:52.893
- No, open it up!
- Don't worry.

41:52.889 --> 41:56.829
Hey, hey, I don't know how to
get back, it's gonna be dark!

41:56.826 --> 41:59.626
Okay, Jorge, let's go.

44:29.244 --> 44:30.254
Hey, what are you doing?

44:30.246 --> 44:36.546
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

44:38.620 --> 44:40.460
I gave you all that money.

44:40.456 --> 44:44.926
I swear on my son's life I will
never tell anyone about this.

44:44.927 --> 44:46.987
You got the money.

44:50.633 --> 44:52.303
What are you doing?

44:52.969 --> 44:56.099
Jorge, back, back, go back!

44:56.105 --> 44:57.905
Back, back.

44:57.907 --> 45:00.607
I will tell you, stay back.

45:00.610 --> 45:02.040
Please!

45:03.144 --> 45:06.924
I paid you the money!
I gave you everything I have.

45:06.916 --> 45:09.416
Why are you doing this?

45:09.418 --> 45:11.148
Please just take me
back to my family.

45:11.153 --> 45:13.263
I swear to god
I'll never tell anybody.

45:13.256 --> 45:17.226
How do I know you won't tell your
government? I won't tell anybody, I swear.

45:17.226 --> 45:18.886
You'll tell your government
and they can

45:18.895 --> 45:21.025
look for me and arrest me,
you think I'm stupid?

45:21.030 --> 45:22.730
No.

45:23.432 --> 45:26.972
I'll never tell anybody, please!

45:26.969 --> 45:28.899
Don't let them die!

45:28.905 --> 45:32.035
Don't you let them die!

45:32.041 --> 45:33.841
Please!

45:35.076 --> 45:37.206
You've got the money!

45:37.213 --> 45:40.423
Do not leave my
family on that island!

45:40.416 --> 45:42.346
Please!

45:44.386 --> 45:47.016
Don't you let them die!

49:52.800 --> 49:56.240
Hey, grab
the lifesaver, grab it.

49:56.238 --> 49:57.838
Pull him in, pull him in now.

50:26.367 --> 50:30.337
Mr. Riley,
detective constable haagen.

50:30.339 --> 50:31.939
We spoke on the phone.

50:31.941 --> 50:34.581
The us embassy
has been notified,

50:34.577 --> 50:35.977
and the us coast guard captain

50:35.978 --> 50:40.818
will guide you through
the rescue plan.

50:40.816 --> 50:42.946
- How's your leg?
- I'll live.

50:42.952 --> 50:45.492
Now we're right here,
and these are the islands

50:45.487 --> 50:48.687
where you most likely made
your initial landfall,

50:48.691 --> 50:50.361
and then you drifted
at sea for at least

50:50.359 --> 50:53.289
one full day and night
more likely going

50:53.295 --> 50:56.525
north northeast following
the prevailing currents.

50:56.532 --> 50:59.432
They move at about four,
four and a half knots.

50:59.435 --> 51:02.775
That potentially takes us out another
150 nautical miles from these islands.

51:02.802 --> 51:04.342
We have an initial
search area.

51:04.340 --> 51:11.550
It's about 2,000 square miles, roughly
the same size as the state of Delaware.

51:11.547 --> 51:13.407
And inside that
search area there are

51:13.415 --> 51:15.645
hundreds of islands and keys.

51:15.651 --> 51:17.991
We can do this, it's just
gonna take some time.

51:17.987 --> 51:21.287
Okay, realistically how long
to search the entire area?

51:21.290 --> 51:25.860
A major search and rescue operation
like this can take weeks.

51:25.861 --> 51:29.761
Weeks? They're gonna be dead
before the sun rises, weeks?

51:29.765 --> 51:31.525
Mr. Riley,
the ships are in preparation

51:31.533 --> 51:33.643
to deploy in about three hours.

51:33.636 --> 51:35.296
And that's gonna
put us at this first

51:35.304 --> 51:37.044
chain of islands
just before dawn.

51:37.039 --> 51:39.469
Don't helicopters have lights?

51:39.475 --> 51:41.775
Yeah, but it's virtually
impossible to spot

51:41.777 --> 51:44.677
two unconscious people
on an unknown island

51:44.680 --> 51:46.910
in the dark,
even with night vision.

51:46.915 --> 51:50.675
There's nothing
we can do right now.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.550
What about the fisherman?

51:53.555 --> 51:56.655
We have to focus on your family and
then we'll find the fisherman.

51:56.659 --> 51:58.759
Why don't we go for
the fisherman right now?

51:58.761 --> 52:01.431
Let's talk alone, please.

52:04.732 --> 52:08.372
How do you suppose
we get this guy?

52:08.370 --> 52:09.470
You don't know his name,

52:09.471 --> 52:11.811
you don't know the
vessel hull number.

52:11.807 --> 52:14.477
I told you on the
phone his name is Jorge.

52:14.476 --> 52:15.876
Jorge.

52:19.013 --> 52:21.413
Mr. Riley, be realistic.

52:23.051 --> 52:27.091
Most likely, Jorge,
is a Cuban migrant.

52:27.089 --> 52:31.329
Most deckhands are immigrant
workers with no records at all.

52:31.327 --> 52:36.327
I bet the fisherman is a migrant
himself, probably Haitian.

52:36.332 --> 52:39.032
- What about the bank?
- We have the video.

52:39.034 --> 52:41.374
We're looking into
the wire transaction

52:41.370 --> 52:44.340
and the receiving account
as we speak.

52:44.340 --> 52:46.410
But this is the Caribbean.

52:46.408 --> 52:48.538
I'm sure you know
that there's a lot

52:48.544 --> 52:52.414
of shady stuff
going on in these banks.

52:55.350 --> 52:58.690
Have you had any arguments
with your wife lately?

52:58.687 --> 53:00.087
Why do you ask?

53:00.089 --> 53:05.959
Does your wife or your son
have life insurance?

53:07.795 --> 53:13.365
No...
Yes, with our credit union.

53:14.969 --> 53:19.069
Where did all the money
from your account come from?

53:19.074 --> 53:22.414
- What difference does it make?
- A big difference.

53:22.411 --> 53:26.811
You rented a boat from a
local man away from the resort.

53:26.815 --> 53:29.145
You don't have a
witness that saw

53:29.151 --> 53:32.491
your wife or your son
get onto that boat.

53:32.488 --> 53:35.988
Days later you show up at a bank

53:35.991 --> 53:41.501
to complete a wire transfer
to an offshore account

53:41.497 --> 53:47.497
accompanied by a
mysterious fisherman.

53:47.503 --> 53:52.943
Mr. Riley,
is there actually a fisherman?

53:52.941 --> 53:58.581
Is it possible that your family
was not on the boat as you said?

54:01.048 --> 54:03.078
Are you serious?

54:03.751 --> 54:06.121
You're wondering if I'm lying?

54:06.121 --> 54:07.821
You're wondering
if I would do something

54:07.823 --> 54:11.423
to harm my six year old son
and my wife?

54:12.827 --> 54:14.697
I don't know who
the fisherman is,

54:14.696 --> 54:19.896
but I know he left my wife
and my son on an island to die.

54:19.902 --> 54:23.442
Right now they are dying
of severe dehydration

54:23.439 --> 54:28.469
and thirst,
unless we go out and save them.

54:30.178 --> 54:32.448
You look exhausted.

54:32.448 --> 54:35.578
You need to get some rest before
the search starts tomorrow.

54:35.584 --> 54:38.954
I'll take you back to the hotel.

54:38.954 --> 54:41.894
We're going to find
your family, Mr. Riley.

54:41.890 --> 54:45.260
We're going to find them.

55:42.016 --> 55:43.976
I have a family, too.

55:46.721 --> 55:49.491
Text me the account number.

55:50.258 --> 55:54.228
There are dozens
of islands back there.

55:54.229 --> 55:59.269
I am the only one who
knows where your family is.

56:29.130 --> 56:32.270
- Damn it.
- Checking out the scores?

56:32.267 --> 56:36.597
Yeah me, too. I tell you, it's the
only thing that keeps me sane.

56:36.605 --> 56:40.805
Family has fun and whatnot
and we go to the beach, and...

56:40.809 --> 56:44.309
But I've been stuck, you know,
with my wife and the kids

56:44.313 --> 56:48.353
in the same hotel room for a
week now, you know what I mean?

56:48.350 --> 56:50.750
Don't get me wrong,
you know, it's a nice place.

56:50.752 --> 56:52.652
I like it here, the family does.

56:52.654 --> 56:53.924
You fish?

56:53.922 --> 56:57.332
Big game fishing,
one of my favorite sports.

56:57.326 --> 57:01.296
I placed third in this one.
You know, I also fish marlin...

57:01.296 --> 57:04.326
What do you do with the
fish after you catch them?

57:04.333 --> 57:07.643
Throw it back in, or sell it.

57:07.636 --> 57:09.096
Who do you sell it to?

57:09.104 --> 57:10.304
Fish suppliers.

57:10.305 --> 57:11.965
Thank you.

57:11.974 --> 57:14.374
Hey, anytime.

57:15.677 --> 57:19.377
Detective, if this guy's a fisherman
then he has to have a buyer.

57:19.381 --> 57:23.281
He's got to have somebody that he sells his fish to
regularly and I think we can track him that way.

57:23.285 --> 57:27.285
Do you know how much resources
it would take to do that?

57:27.289 --> 57:31.789
And if by some miracle we do track
him down through the buyer,

57:31.793 --> 57:35.633
there's no guarantee that the fisherman
will talk in time to save your family.

57:35.631 --> 57:38.801
- I'll make him talk.
- The plan is to search and rescue.

57:38.800 --> 57:42.140
We do not have all the resources
possible so you have to bear with us.

57:42.137 --> 57:44.867
Let me jump in here. Mr.
Riley, let me introduce myself.

57:44.891 --> 57:48.411
I'm Brian sweeney, I'm deputy chief
of mission United States embassy.

57:48.410 --> 57:51.280
- Can I have a word with you?
- We're on the case, okay?

57:51.279 --> 57:53.249
Look, I know the
detective personally.

57:53.248 --> 57:55.078
He's a good man, he's
been around the block.

57:55.109 --> 57:57.079
Let's let him find the
fisherman, all right?

57:57.085 --> 57:59.385
But in the meantime I need
every available resource

57:59.388 --> 58:02.388
out there searching for your
family and that includes you.

58:02.391 --> 58:07.401
You have the 100% cooperation and
backing of the United States embassy.

58:07.396 --> 58:08.656
- Let them do their job.
- Thank you.

58:08.664 --> 58:09.934
- Okay?
- Thank you.

58:09.931 --> 58:12.371
Hey, Mr. Riley.

58:12.367 --> 58:14.967
- Yeah.
- Don't go too far.

58:14.970 --> 58:17.670
They're expecting you
at the base in an hour.

58:17.673 --> 58:20.723
I'm just gonna go up to my
room, I'll be back in a minute.

58:20.741 --> 58:22.131
In an hour, Mr. Riley.

58:25.913 --> 58:27.383
Hey, can I get a taxi?

58:27.382 --> 58:28.452
Right away.

58:28.450 --> 58:30.580
Taxi.

58:31.852 --> 58:33.822
Thank you.

58:34.989 --> 58:36.919
Where to, boss?

58:36.925 --> 58:38.885
Where do fishermen sell
their fish around here?

58:38.918 --> 58:40.858
We can go to the market
if it's still open.

58:40.862 --> 58:43.202
- Let's go.
- All right.

59:30.478 --> 59:33.378
Excuse me, I'm looking for
a couple of fishermen

59:33.381 --> 59:36.781
that may be doing business here,
one is... Haitian.

59:36.785 --> 59:38.885
He's really thin,
he's probably 40 years old,

59:38.887 --> 59:40.747
average height, do you
know somebody like that?

59:40.775 --> 59:42.915
I don't know anybody,
there's this guy named Roger.

59:42.924 --> 59:43.684
He knows all of them.

59:43.709 --> 59:45.489
Maybe you can catch him
at the loading dock.

59:45.494 --> 59:49.404
- He drives a brown Van.
- Thank you. Thanks.

01:00:07.181 --> 01:00:10.451
Hey, stop the Van!

01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:12.651
Hey, stop!

01:00:13.254 --> 01:00:15.224
I'm sorry, man.

01:00:15.223 --> 01:00:17.533
I was told that you might be
able to help me with something.

01:00:17.559 --> 01:00:19.129
I'm looking for a
couple of fisherman

01:00:19.127 --> 01:00:20.527
who probably do business here.

01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:22.929
One is Haitian and he's
got a guy he works with.

01:00:22.931 --> 01:00:26.201
His name is Jorge, he's latino.
Does the name ring a bell or...?

01:00:26.201 --> 01:00:28.371
- No, man.
- What about the boat?

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.000
Pretty rusty antennas going...

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:32.405
I been doing this for
30 years, I would know.

01:00:32.407 --> 01:00:34.807
No one we deal
with comes to mind.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:36.880
How do you know those guys
are here at the market?

01:00:36.878 --> 01:00:39.878
There are hundreds of boats
and owners all over the islands.

01:00:39.881 --> 01:00:41.551
What if I were to hire
somebody like a deckhand,

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:44.050
you know, somebody to work
on my boat for me with me?

01:00:44.052 --> 01:00:46.922
You can try the...
The harbor in the morning.

01:00:46.922 --> 01:00:49.122
Okay, night fishing. What if i
wanted to hire someone tonight?

01:00:49.124 --> 01:00:51.464
How would I do that?

01:00:52.426 --> 01:00:56.126
If you are desperate
there's a bar by the harbor.

01:00:56.131 --> 01:00:59.401
They all hang out there, easy.

01:01:14.582 --> 01:01:16.552
Hey, man.

01:01:30.297 --> 01:01:31.627
Guys, excuse me.

01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:35.003
Hey, um, I'm looking for a guy
by the name of Jorge.

01:01:35.003 --> 01:01:37.173
- Do you by any chance know...
- What do you need?

01:01:37.172 --> 01:01:38.572
What do you need?

01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:39.973
Deck hand for my boat.

01:01:39.975 --> 01:01:41.605
Got a couple of
guys here you know?

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:43.880
No, no, it's okay, I just
want to hire the guy Jorge.

01:01:43.879 --> 01:01:47.879
- Do you know him?
- Yeah, that guy, blue shirt.

01:01:54.588 --> 01:01:55.918
Jorge.

01:01:55.924 --> 01:01:57.764
Yes?

01:02:00.027 --> 01:02:02.197
Sorry.
Haagen.

01:02:02.197 --> 01:02:05.067
Detective are there any
leads on the fisherman?

01:02:05.066 --> 01:02:06.166
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:02:06.167 --> 01:02:08.597
This is starting to look very suspicious.
What are you not telling me?

01:02:08.603 --> 01:02:12.213
I cannot just sit on my ass
and wait for the sun to come up.

01:02:12.207 --> 01:02:15.537
I need you to tell me
where you are, immediately.

01:02:15.543 --> 01:02:20.313
Okay, you know what, you call me if
there's any further developments.

01:02:20.948 --> 01:02:23.078
I'm telling you, my friend,
something's going on.

01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:26.294
From the first time I saw him
i know something was wrong.

01:02:26.288 --> 01:02:28.448
Yeah.

01:02:36.597 --> 01:02:40.367
What's up, boss, where to now?

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.870
I don't know.

01:02:45.706 --> 01:02:48.806
What you looking for, man?

01:02:49.643 --> 01:02:51.013
Do you want some girls?

01:02:51.012 --> 01:02:55.082
- No, no, girls.
- Okay.

01:02:55.083 --> 01:03:00.193
Here, you know what, I'm gonna
give you 100 bucks just to wait.

01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:02.958
- No problem, man.
- Where'd you get that scar?

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:06.028
Man, I was cooking some
swordfish and a bone sliced it,

01:03:06.027 --> 01:03:08.587
almost cut my finger off.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:11.130
Where did you get the sutures?

01:03:11.132 --> 01:03:14.272
- What?
- Stitches, who fixed you up?

01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:16.039
They did it
at the hospital, man.

01:03:16.037 --> 01:03:19.037
Which one, how many are there around here?
There's only one.

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:30.990
Excuse me, I have a leg wound

01:03:30.986 --> 01:03:32.716
that is showing
signs of infection.

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.991
- Please, first door.
- Thank you.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:36.790
Okay.

01:03:40.361 --> 01:03:41.661
Please, listen to me.

01:03:41.663 --> 01:03:44.103
A few days ago, I took a
boat ride with my family.

01:03:44.099 --> 01:03:47.999
We got stranded on an
island and a fisherman

01:03:48.003 --> 01:03:49.773
asked us for a lot
of money to save us.

01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:52.611
He took me back to
the shore and he left

01:03:52.607 --> 01:03:54.737
my wife and my child
on the island.

01:03:54.743 --> 01:03:56.743
After he received the money
he tried to drown me

01:03:56.745 --> 01:03:59.045
and then he just disappeared.

01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:01.777
My wife and my son
are still out on that island,

01:04:01.783 --> 01:04:05.323
and they have severe
dehydration right now.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.020
The fisherman is Haitian
about 40 years old.

01:04:09.024 --> 01:04:11.564
- He's very thin really, really thin.
- Sir, please.

01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:15.029
He's average height,
but he's got a deep laceration

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:18.170
on his inner tricep
and the sutures are fresh.

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.566
They can't be more
than a week old

01:04:19.567 --> 01:04:23.437
and I think that
he got them here.

01:04:24.405 --> 01:04:27.565
I need, I need his information.

01:04:29.143 --> 01:04:33.053
Look, look, I'm a doctor, too.

01:04:33.048 --> 01:04:37.178
Good, then you should know
i can't do that.

01:04:37.185 --> 01:04:38.425
I didn't come
here for treatment.

01:04:38.451 --> 01:04:41.061
That man is the only person who
knows where my wife and my son are.

01:04:41.056 --> 01:04:44.116
- Sorry, sir we can't...
- Listen to me, the only person...

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:47.055
Sir, we can't give out
any patient's information

01:04:47.062 --> 01:04:48.602
unless you're a police.

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:50.456
You should know that,
you're a doctor, right?

01:04:50.465 --> 01:04:51.725
He'll never talk to the police.

01:04:51.733 --> 01:04:54.773
The only person
he's gonna talk to is me.

01:04:54.769 --> 01:04:59.439
Look, that's my wife,
that's my wife.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:03.111
That's us,
that's my wife and my son.

01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:05.081
That's my wife and my son.

01:05:05.813 --> 01:05:08.183
That man is the only
person who knows

01:05:08.183 --> 01:05:10.223
where my wife and my son are.

01:05:10.218 --> 01:05:12.688
He's not gonna tell
the police anything.

01:05:12.687 --> 01:05:15.657
I need his
information for myself.

01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:17.417
- Sorry, sir.
- Please.

01:05:17.425 --> 01:05:19.785
I can't do that.

01:05:19.794 --> 01:05:22.834
Yes, you can.

01:05:22.831 --> 01:05:27.231
I can't do that but I'm going
to step out for a minute, okay?

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.840
<i>Dr. clergen,
we need your assistance.</i>

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:37.113
<i>Dr. clergen,
we need your assistance.</i>

01:05:37.112 --> 01:05:39.252
<i>Please dial in at once.</i>

01:06:12.913 --> 01:06:15.313
"Miguel kaba."

01:06:18.218 --> 01:06:21.148
I got you, you son of a bitch.

01:07:16.243 --> 01:07:18.953
I want you to wait here.

01:07:18.947 --> 01:07:20.947
A man is going to come with me.

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:25.179
If you don't ask any questions
I'm gonna give you another $100.

01:09:07.554 --> 01:09:09.993
Who's this?

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.060
I'm looking for Miguel.

01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:17.959
Who's this?

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:23.640
I need a man with a boat.

01:09:23.638 --> 01:09:25.837
I was told down in the
Marina by some guys

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.779
that he's good,
so I want to hire him.

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:40.557
Go away, go away now.

01:09:40.586 --> 01:09:41.566
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:44.488
Do not touch my daughter!
I just need to know where Miguel is.

01:09:44.492 --> 01:09:48.532
I don't know! -I swear to you, I'm
not gonna hurt your child or you.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:50.059
I just need to know,
where is Miguel?

01:09:50.064 --> 01:09:51.834
I don't know,
i say I don't know!

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:52.973
I know he lives here!

01:09:52.966 --> 01:09:55.467
- Get back!
- What about Jorge?

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.140
- I don't know.
- Where is Jorge?

01:09:57.138 --> 01:10:02.508
I know you know Jorge, where is he? I
don't know, i don't know, I don't know!

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.860
Where is he? Where is he?

01:10:24.664 --> 01:10:28.874
Gpc 9243.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.100
Take me back there.

01:10:55.096 --> 01:10:56.876
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.100
Take me back there right
this fucking second.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.030
You kidnapped my
wife and my son!

01:11:01.035 --> 01:11:02.425
Fuck you.

01:11:10.444 --> 01:11:12.484
- Take me back there!
- Fuck you!

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.750
You're fucking taking me back.
You have to take me back there.

01:11:16.751 --> 01:11:18.921
Take me back to my family!

01:11:20.221 --> 01:11:21.921
Take me back.

01:11:25.092 --> 01:11:29.632
Let him go, now, now!

01:11:35.535 --> 01:11:36.565
Papa.

01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.071
Go back, go back!

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:41.037
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:44.212
- Let her go!
- Put that thing down!

01:11:44.212 --> 01:11:45.552
How does it feel?

01:11:45.546 --> 01:11:47.576
Swear to god somebody's
gonna get hurt!

01:11:47.582 --> 01:11:49.152
Put it down!

01:11:51.652 --> 01:11:53.622
You put it down!

01:11:54.822 --> 01:11:58.022
No, no!

01:12:09.569 --> 01:12:11.269
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:16.641
I'm gonna kill you.

01:13:47.133 --> 01:13:49.703
It's a gruesome
scene at that house.

01:13:49.704 --> 01:13:51.304
That was self-defense.

01:13:51.305 --> 01:13:54.835
Listen to me,
i have the hull number.

01:13:54.842 --> 01:13:56.642
That means we can locate Jorge.

01:13:56.644 --> 01:14:00.254
Mr. Riley, you're responsible
for the murder of two people,

01:14:00.247 --> 01:14:01.647
including a little girl.

01:14:01.649 --> 01:14:03.149
- That was an accident.
- You're hereby

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:05.020
held into custody,
you held her at knife point

01:14:05.019 --> 01:14:07.389
before slitting her
father's throat.

01:14:07.388 --> 01:14:12.188
No, i... I didn't kill her,
i did not, I'm innocent.

01:14:12.193 --> 01:14:14.193
You transferred a
large amount of money

01:14:14.195 --> 01:14:17.295
and were implicated in a
double homicide after that.

01:14:17.298 --> 01:14:19.728
The fisherman made
me transfer the money.

01:14:19.734 --> 01:14:21.404
There's a boat sunk in the sea.

01:14:21.402 --> 01:14:23.072
What do you...
What do you think I did?

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:26.010
You think I tried to fake
drown myself in a boat?

01:14:26.007 --> 01:14:28.237
Well, it looks like
you were either involved

01:14:28.242 --> 01:14:29.782
in a money laundering scheme,

01:14:29.777 --> 01:14:32.377
or you paid the fisherman
to get rid of your family

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.850
and then you got rid of him.

01:14:33.848 --> 01:14:35.718
I'm not talking to you anymore.
I'm not talking...

01:14:35.716 --> 01:14:37.716
- I'm talking to him.
- Be my guest.

01:14:37.718 --> 01:14:40.088
Listen, I got the number for the boat.
You need to stop talking right now.

01:14:40.087 --> 01:14:44.257
All right, this no longer a
missing persons investigation.

01:14:44.258 --> 01:14:46.788
This is now a homicide,
you need to get a lawyer.

01:14:46.794 --> 01:14:48.364
- Gpc 9243.
- Are you listening to me?

01:14:48.362 --> 01:14:49.962
That means we can get to Jorge, we can make
him lead... -Our office can prevent...

01:14:49.964 --> 01:14:55.274
Forget Jorge, Mr. Riley,
the search has been called off.

01:14:55.269 --> 01:14:57.399
- Okay, the search is over.
- What, why?

01:14:57.405 --> 01:15:01.805
Why? Because you're an American citizen who is
in custody and they just think you murdered

01:15:01.809 --> 01:15:03.409
two of their nationals,
that's why.

01:15:03.411 --> 01:15:05.751
What are you gonna do, you gonna
leave them out there to die?!

01:15:05.746 --> 01:15:06.806
It's not what I'm gonna do.

01:15:06.814 --> 01:15:08.384
Mr. Riley,
there's nothing I can do.

01:15:08.382 --> 01:15:10.852
They no longer believe
that your story is credible

01:15:10.851 --> 01:15:12.751
so they are calling
off the search.

01:15:12.753 --> 01:15:15.613
Okay, you got to understand that
this is a tourist nation, all right?

01:15:15.631 --> 01:15:17.891
They rely heavily on tourists.
I don't give a fuck!

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:21.044
Okay, listen the last thing they
want is a media shit storm that

01:15:21.062 --> 01:15:24.062
they think is started by someone
who they consider a murderer.

01:15:24.065 --> 01:15:26.465
All right, so just take my
advice...

01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:28.197
What do you think I'm doing?
Why do you think I'm lying?

01:15:28.202 --> 01:15:29.472
You have got to
keep your mouth shut!

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:30.280
What makes you
think I'm lying?

01:15:30.304 --> 01:15:31.304
No we went to a hotel, we checked in, my
wife and son, then we went on a ride...

01:15:31.322 --> 01:15:35.342
Mr. Riley, I'm trying to help you. And then the fisherman...
I'm trying to help you. -Left my wife and my son...

01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:37.979
There's nothing else that i can do
for you, listen. - To die, to die!

01:15:37.978 --> 01:15:40.588
My hands are tied. I'm trying to help and
I am going to do... what if you're wrong?

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.669
What if you're wrong? It doesn't matter.
Mr. Riley listen to me.

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:44.050
You're gonna have blood
on your hands, man!

01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:46.131
Listen to me, you are
under investigation.

01:15:46.153 --> 01:15:49.413
You're gonna have two innocent people. You're
about to get transferred, you are gonna

01:15:49.432 --> 01:15:52.362
get transferred to a secure facility where
you will receive medical treatment.

01:15:52.359 --> 01:15:54.029
Just take him away, please.

01:15:54.028 --> 01:15:57.898
Mr. Riley, Mr. Riley calm down.

01:15:58.465 --> 01:16:00.565
Jesus Christ!

01:16:01.801 --> 01:16:04.201
- Get back, get back.
- I got back.

01:16:04.205 --> 01:16:07.735
Get back, uncuff me.

01:16:07.742 --> 01:16:09.112
- Uncuff him.
- Get back!

01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:10.240
Okay.

01:16:10.244 --> 01:16:13.014
I did not kill that girl!

01:16:13.013 --> 01:16:14.813
It was an accident!

01:16:14.815 --> 01:16:16.815
And my wife and my son
are out there!

01:16:16.817 --> 01:16:21.217
- I... Kevin, I believe you.
- No, you don't.

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:27.588
You follow me...

01:16:29.162 --> 01:16:30.802
I'll shoot.

01:16:30.798 --> 01:16:32.898
I'll shoot.

01:16:41.107 --> 01:16:43.707
He's armed and dangerous.

01:18:05.358 --> 01:18:07.488
Kevin!

01:19:09.355 --> 01:19:12.355
<i>All units on a high alert.</i>

01:20:22.462 --> 01:20:24.732
- Good morning, guys.
- Good morning.

01:20:24.732 --> 01:20:26.702
I don't mean to be rude,
I'm just in a real hurry.

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.270
- Yes?
- Last night, I was out with a couple guys

01:20:29.269 --> 01:20:32.609
and they told me they're going shark fishing
and I've actually never been before

01:20:32.606 --> 01:20:34.206
and I kind of missed
them this morning

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:36.008
and I don't know
where their boat is.

01:20:36.010 --> 01:20:38.380
So I kind of need to
know where it's docked.

01:20:38.379 --> 01:20:41.479
I can't help you without a
last name and a hull number.

01:20:41.482 --> 01:20:45.322
Miguel kaba is his name,
and he mentioned

01:20:45.319 --> 01:20:50.819
that the hull number
was gpc 9243.

01:21:00.466 --> 01:21:02.866
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:21:04.303 --> 01:21:08.213
Miguel kaba,
number c-four-four-zero-zero.

01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:10.738
- Slip 37, compass king.
- How do I get there?

01:21:10.744 --> 01:21:12.754
You have to
take the north ferry,

01:21:12.746 --> 01:21:15.576
- it's about an hour from here.
- Thank you.

01:21:16.049 --> 01:21:20.689
Wait. Actually, the lease was
terminated on the slip yesterday.

01:21:20.687 --> 01:21:22.657
Are you saying that
the boat isn't there?

01:21:22.656 --> 01:21:26.356
That's right, man. Sorry, but your
fishing trip might not happen after all.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.260
You know you can rent a boat

01:21:28.262 --> 01:21:31.132
from one of the locals
if you want.

01:22:00.561 --> 01:22:02.861
Everything
is coming, I promise you.

01:22:02.863 --> 01:22:05.233
We'll go over everything...

01:22:05.865 --> 01:22:10.165
I'll be back in the
office in a couple hours.

01:22:22.682 --> 01:22:24.252
United States embassy.

01:22:24.817 --> 01:22:27.817
Yes, sir, yes, please hold.

01:22:27.821 --> 01:22:31.161
Sir, sir. -This guy is on an
island with limited recourse.

01:22:31.158 --> 01:22:33.228
- Sir!
- Get his wife's credit card... what?

01:22:33.227 --> 01:22:34.657
It's him, line two.

01:22:34.661 --> 01:22:35.761
<i>Mr. Riley.</i>

01:22:35.762 --> 01:22:37.832
Jorge has a cell phone.

01:22:37.831 --> 01:22:39.771
Mr. Riley you have
got to understand...

01:22:39.766 --> 01:22:42.236
The fisherman called Jorge on his
phone when we left the bank.

01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:46.566
Being on the run, you are making
your case infinitely harder.

01:22:46.573 --> 01:22:50.773
Jorge definitely has a cell phone, so the only
way I'm gonna give myself up is if you...

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.849
you trace his calls, you get him,
you bring him to main square

01:22:53.878 --> 01:22:56.808
at noon, and you have yourself,
the police and a translator.

01:22:56.835 --> 01:22:59.145
That's the only way I'm gonna
give myself up, do you hear me?

01:22:59.153 --> 01:23:04.893
Mr. Riley, I promise you, i am gonna do
everything in my power to help you out

01:23:04.892 --> 01:23:07.292
<i>but I want you to
do me one favor.</i>

01:23:07.294 --> 01:23:09.934
Don't do anything rash, okay?

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:11.660
<i>Mr. Riley?</i>

01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:14.331
Mr. ri...

01:23:14.901 --> 01:23:16.601
Amber.

01:24:31.244 --> 01:24:32.954
<i>- Haagen.
- You think you can outsmart me?</i>

01:24:32.946 --> 01:24:34.576
I told you
i would give myself up

01:24:34.581 --> 01:24:36.281
but only if you
let me see Jorge.

01:24:36.283 --> 01:24:39.323
If you don't,
you're never gonna catch me.

01:24:39.319 --> 01:24:42.989
We called Jorge's number,
whoever picked up got spooked.

01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:44.590
<i>The signal disappeared.</i>

01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:46.631
If it was Jorge
then he's probably

01:24:46.627 --> 01:24:50.297
on his way
off the island for good.

01:24:50.297 --> 01:24:55.427
Kevin, I believe you,
but you're wanted for murder.

01:24:55.435 --> 01:24:59.735
In order to help you,
i need you to turn yourself in.

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.740
Otherwise you're gonna spend
the rest of your life running.

01:25:06.545 --> 01:25:08.345
<i>Kevin.</i>

01:25:09.382 --> 01:25:11.282
Kevin.

01:26:49.515 --> 01:26:51.415
Jorge?

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.420
- Jorge!
- What's going on?

01:26:56.423 --> 01:26:59.833
Stop the bus, stop,
stop the bus.

01:26:59.826 --> 01:27:01.886
Jorge, stop!

01:27:05.698 --> 01:27:09.128
Jorge, stop! Jorge!

01:27:09.502 --> 01:27:11.302
Stop!

01:27:11.972 --> 01:27:13.912
Stop!

01:27:14.473 --> 01:27:16.113
Stop!

01:27:18.411 --> 01:27:21.851
Jorge, Jorge, stop.

01:27:21.848 --> 01:27:24.878
My family, please.

01:27:29.855 --> 01:27:32.155
My family!

01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:38.929
<i>Familia, familia. Familia!</i>

01:27:40.499 --> 01:27:46.569
<i>Please, no...
No policia, no policia.</i>

01:27:46.573 --> 01:27:50.173
My family, where is my family?

01:27:50.443 --> 01:27:52.183
Please.

01:28:23.476 --> 01:28:25.976
Get back in your truck.

01:28:26.912 --> 01:28:29.612
Move it a few feet forward.

01:28:33.819 --> 01:28:36.349
Couple feet,
that's it, that's it.

01:28:55.608 --> 01:28:59.608
- Call for help.
- I don't have a phone.

01:29:18.531 --> 01:29:20.631
Jorge, Jorge.

01:29:21.567 --> 01:29:23.097
Jorge.

01:29:25.304 --> 01:29:27.974
Where is my family?

01:29:28.774 --> 01:29:33.114
Look, where is my family,
are they here?

01:29:33.279 --> 01:29:34.879
Are they here?

01:29:34.881 --> 01:29:36.981
Look on this map.

01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:40.720
Where is my family?

01:29:41.554 --> 01:29:44.164
Which island, which island?

01:29:44.157 --> 01:29:46.717
Jorge. Jorge.

01:29:46.859 --> 01:29:48.629
Jorge!

01:29:49.828 --> 01:29:51.728
You have to look!

01:29:52.264 --> 01:29:54.374
You have to look!

01:29:59.673 --> 01:30:01.673
Which one?

01:30:05.644 --> 01:30:10.154
Is it that one? Or is it
this one, which one is it?

01:30:18.157 --> 01:30:21.027
Where's the closest Marina?

01:30:22.194 --> 01:30:24.464
I'm taking your truck.

01:30:32.338 --> 01:30:34.708
Where's the hospital?

01:30:44.016 --> 01:30:48.446
Help me get him in the truck.
Take down the gate.

01:30:53.792 --> 01:30:57.832
Hey, hey, you take him
to the hospital.

01:30:57.831 --> 01:31:00.201
Drive fast or he's gonna die.

01:31:50.315 --> 01:31:51.775
Sir.

01:31:54.019 --> 01:31:56.549
Can you take me to this island?

01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:58.459
I'll pay you.

01:31:58.458 --> 01:31:59.788
How long will it take us?

01:31:59.793 --> 01:32:02.393
I have to take her
to fill up first.

01:32:02.395 --> 01:32:05.325
By nightfall, if we're lucky.

01:32:07.733 --> 01:32:09.503
All right?

01:32:21.848 --> 01:32:23.778
- Guys?
- - What's up, man, how can I help you?

01:32:23.783 --> 01:32:25.853
I'll pay you a lot of money if
you take me out to the island.

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:27.145
Nah, man, we're all
right, we're good.

01:32:27.153 --> 01:32:29.723
Shit for five grand
I'll take you anywhere, bro.

01:32:29.723 --> 01:32:31.363
- Fine.
- You got cash on you right now?

01:32:31.357 --> 01:32:32.887
I'll pay you in full tomorrow.

01:32:32.892 --> 01:32:35.962
I don't know you like that, man. Get the
fuck out of here, man, with that bullshit.

01:32:35.962 --> 01:32:37.802
You hear this dude?
Get in the back, babe.

01:32:37.797 --> 01:32:40.797
No, man... you get the fuck out of here.
Yo, calm down, brother.

01:32:40.824 --> 01:32:43.694
This is my dad's boat, all right.
Calm down, he's gonna kill me.

01:32:45.371 --> 01:32:48.411
Get out! Untie it untie it.

01:32:59.017 --> 01:33:00.447
Yeah, he just took my boat.

01:33:00.453 --> 01:33:03.823
Nah, some guy just got on with a gun and
took my dad's boat, you don't get it.

01:33:03.823 --> 01:33:08.393
He just ran off with it, he pulled a
gun on us. It's a yellow speedboat.

01:34:24.436 --> 01:34:26.236
<i>Stolen vessel description.</i>

01:34:26.239 --> 01:34:28.369
<i>I repeat, stolen.</i>

01:34:32.010 --> 01:34:34.080
<i>Yellow twin engine powerboat.</i>

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.950
<i>Suspect is white male, late 30s.</i>

01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:08.449
This is harbor patrol.
Shut off the engine.

01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:12.481
Shut off your
engine, immediately.

01:35:27.332 --> 01:35:28.632
This is harbor patrol.

01:35:28.635 --> 01:35:31.065
Shut off your engine,
immediately.

01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:33.070
We will open fire.

01:35:33.906 --> 01:35:36.866
This is your last warning.

01:36:00.699 --> 01:36:03.329
Engage, engage, engage.

01:38:39.858 --> 01:38:41.688
Julie!

01:38:43.762 --> 01:38:45.632
Jules!

01:38:48.667 --> 01:38:50.667
Jules!

01:39:23.135 --> 01:39:24.895
Baby, I'm here.

01:39:27.439 --> 01:39:30.209
Okay, let's get you some water.

01:39:30.209 --> 01:39:32.579
Just a little. Just a little.

01:39:32.578 --> 01:39:37.548
Just take it off my finger,
that's it that's it.

01:39:44.756 --> 01:39:47.556
Daddy's here, I'm here.

01:39:59.504 --> 01:40:02.444
Come on to daddy,
come on, come on, come on.

01:40:02.441 --> 01:40:05.411
Come on. Come on.

01:40:05.411 --> 01:40:08.581
Come on, Andy, come on, come on.

01:40:17.222 --> 01:40:20.562
Come on, boy, come on,
come on, come on.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.690
Come on, boy, come on, come on.

01:40:22.695 --> 01:40:25.095
Come to me, boy, come.

01:40:30.302 --> 01:40:32.542
Come to me, come to me.

01:40:32.538 --> 01:40:35.668
Come on.
That's it, that's it, that's it.

01:40:35.675 --> 01:40:40.335
I'm right here, boy. Good, okay.

01:40:54.326 --> 01:40:57.996
That's it my boy
that's it, that-a-boy.

01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:21.490
I told you everything
was gonna be okay, chief.

01:41:21.487 --> 01:41:24.287
We're going home.

01:41:49.748 --> 01:41:54.418
Baby, baby, let's go home.
