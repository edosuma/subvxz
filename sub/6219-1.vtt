if he gave us

21:07.225 --> 21:08.852
-Ellie.
-Max, get out!

21:08.935 --> 21:10.228
Listen, I don't see
what the problem is.

21:10.311 --> 21:11.855
Your dad's been showing
this place to tenants.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.648
Not this room.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.776
-Out.
-Sorry.

21:19.571 --> 21:22.907
MAX: I didn't...
Sorry, I didn't
mean to cause you any trouble.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.201
Just come in here.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.370
ELLIE: It's okay.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.547
How can you pretend like
nothing's happened?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.009
-What's wrong?
-You hire some idiot

21:41.092 --> 21:43.636
to give the place a makeover
and hope it'll all go away?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.972
Business is bad, Kate.
You know that.

21:46.056 --> 21:48.350
Is that why
we're renting out Jed's room?

21:51.436 --> 21:53.772
Jed's gone, love.
And I'm sorry about that.

21:53.855 --> 21:56.149
-This place killed him.
-It was an accident.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.655
I don't want to
stay here, Dad.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.116
I don't want you to
stay here, either.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.244
People were experimented on,

22:08.328 --> 22:11.414
abused, made to disappear.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.249
If I could have
stopped it, I would.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.544
I am asking you to
do the right thing.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.129
Walk away.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.548
Would it make any difference
to me and you if I did?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.217
It would be a start.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.972
Yeah, I didn't even
know she was back.

22:28.056 --> 22:32.227
She worked in,
uh, sales and PR here.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.270
Yeah. You could probably
tell from her...

22:44.698 --> 22:45.782
(GASPS)

22:48.827 --> 22:51.705
You were kind of
zoned out there for a minute.

22:52.664 --> 22:53.707
I'm fine.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.125
Look, you need to
sit down for a minute.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.251
No, I need to go.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.294
Where? Huh? Back to your car?

23:03.174 --> 23:05.343
-Why is that there?
-What?

23:09.305 --> 23:10.557
Who put that there?

23:12.434 --> 23:14.519
Now, that wasn't there before.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.438
I don't know
what's happening to me.

so we don't really
do guest bedding.

Look, I'm...

24:41.356 --> 24:44.526
I'm really
sorry about earlier.
I flew off the handle.

24:44.609 --> 24:47.404
-It wasn't fair on you.
-No, it's fine, I understand.

24:48.113 --> 24:49.656
Ellie knew Jed.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.331
Not very well. I just, um...

24:58.415 --> 25:01.876
I just met him
a couple of times
a few years ago.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.090
-Where?
-Just out and about.

25:09.175 --> 25:12.303
DAN: I have had
a nightmare day at work.

25:12.387 --> 25:15.515
Oh, God,
don't tell me you live here.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.392
Didn't Daddy mention it?

25:17.475 --> 25:19.060
You bought
own-brand beer again?

25:19.144 --> 25:20.729
Oh, mate, it's all beer!

25:22.313 --> 25:24.482
Be good.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.776
Really like to get
to know you better.

25:27.986 --> 25:28.987
Hey.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.698
-Ellie.
-Right.

25:32.866 --> 25:33.992
You made up your mind?

25:34.075 --> 25:36.411
Well, I don't think
I can really afford it.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.205
She's going to kip on the sofa
until she can sort
something else out.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.416
That's cool. We could do
a deal on the spare room.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.168
Or two of us could share.

25:43.251 --> 25:44.544
Max never thought I'd ask.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.921
The sofa's fine.
It's just for tonight.

25:50.550 --> 25:53.261
So... How was the big trip?

25:53.345 --> 25:55.638
-Turns out it was
just what I needed.
-I bet. Where'd you go?

25:55.722 --> 25:58.141
Cambodia, Nepal, Thailand...

25:58.224 --> 26:00.602
Ellie's just been to Thailand.

26:00.685 --> 26:03.730
-Bet it's amazing out there.
-Yeah. Totally.

26:03.813 --> 26:07.275
Really? I thought
the place was just full of
bloody Western hippies.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.902
And daddy's girls.

26:11.363 --> 26:13.448
But the diving in Ko Rang
was pretty cool.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.283
How about you?
Where did you go?

26:16.701 --> 26:18.953
Uh, I can't remember.

26:19.037 --> 26:21.623
-I wasn't there
for very long, so...
-Weren't you?

26:21.706 --> 26:24.167
DAN: I might go out there
for a few months.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.586
Oh, wait, your dad needs me.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.845
I know you think
you're quite the man,
swinging your balls around

26:35.929 --> 26:38.515
but you have no idea
what you're getting
yourself involved with.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.018
What is going on with you?

26:42.102 --> 26:45.188
-You heard about my cousin?
-Yeah. Accident, right?

26:45.271 --> 26:47.190
Was that Warren's fault?

26:48.316 --> 26:50.193
Why do you hate him so much?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.904
My family is none
of your business.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.072
I will find out.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.907
This is my family's building.

26:55.990 --> 26:59.077
And it's doing really well,
thanks, since your dad
gave me your job.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.788
I have a say in its future,
it's got nothing
to do with you.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.749
Yeah? Well, let's find out
who's Daddy's favorite,
shall we?

27:04.833 --> 27:07.377
Okay,
I'm going to go talk to him.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.630
-And I'm going
to have you fired.
-Go for it.

27:15.677 --> 27:18.888
Cocky little shit!
I can't believe you
employed him to...

27:18.972 --> 27:20.432
Oh, shit.

27:20.515 --> 27:23.810
Okay, so I was going to say
something earlier...

27:23.893 --> 27:25.020
Go.

27:25.103 --> 27:26.730
Oh, I can't believe
I've been so stupid!

27:26.813 --> 27:29.232
Don't over-react, okay?

27:29.315 --> 27:31.860
-I can't find my shoes.
-Kiera, just get out!

27:34.154 --> 27:37.824
-Just go, Kiera!
-Actually, I...
I do need my shoes.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.075
Okay.

27:41.745 --> 27:43.288
Well, if you're going to
walk in uninvited...

27:43.371 --> 27:45.331
She's just a vulnerable kid!

27:45.415 --> 27:47.500
She's an adult,
we like each other.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.169
And she was here for me
when you weren't.

27:49.252 --> 27:51.421
Ugh!
God, that is so screwed-up
on so many levels

27:51.504 --> 27:53.214
I don't even
know where to start!

27:53.298 --> 27:54.799
You just take
whatever you want,
don't you?

27:54.883 --> 27:58.970
Actually, she was the one
that made the first...

27:59.054 --> 28:02.766
This is silly.
Can we not just be
how we use to be?

28:04.059 --> 28:06.728
I came back to get
my share of this place.

28:06.811 --> 28:08.646
That's all.

28:08.730 --> 28:12.108
So if you won't sell, then
there's nothing
here that I want.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.527
Kate, don't say
things you might regret.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.613

It's ghosts.
You see ghosts, don't you?

I'm some sort of circus freak?

What do they look like?

38:29.351 --> 38:33.229
They look confused and lost.

38:33.313 --> 38:35.565
Out there, anyway.
But in here, it's different.

38:35.648 --> 38:37.525
-Different how?
-Hate and anger.

38:37.609 --> 38:38.943
I've never seen that before.

Look, I'm kind of an expert
at this stuff...

An expert whose
first question is,
"What do they look like?"

38:46.076 --> 38:49.162
Since I came here,
I keep having
like blackouts or something.

38:49.245 --> 38:50.997
It's like a dream
but I'm not asleep.

38:51.081 --> 38:54.250

seeing this same man
over and over again

38:54.334 --> 38:56.628

He hanged himself.

38:56.711 --> 38:59.339

the revenant died.

-The what?
-Revenant.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.558
Okay,
so I'm seeing how they died.

39:10.642 --> 39:13.603
-That's what
being a medium is.
-No, I'm not a medium.

39:13.687 --> 39:15.522
What do you think's
happening to you, Ellie?

39:15.605 --> 39:17.899
I mean, what do you think
happened to Jed?

39:17.982 --> 39:20.527
I know what
you're seeing is real.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.779
I know it.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.573
-And we can make it stop.
-All of it?

at a time, yeah?

39:28.993 --> 39:31.162
I don't know what
it wants from me.

39:31.246 --> 39:33.331
Okay.

39:33.415 --> 39:34.833
Where were you when
it first happened?

39:34.916 --> 39:36.584
I was just wandering around
the building,

39:36.668 --> 39:38.920
the old part
that's closed off.

39:39.004 --> 39:40.380
And there was
a loose board and...

39:40.463 --> 39:41.840
And something fell out,
like a...

39:48.596 --> 39:51.141
Like a skeleton.

39:51.224 --> 39:52.767
-A skeleton?
-That's it.

39:53.935 --> 39:55.895
That's when
the visions started.

39:55.979 --> 39:59.149
This patient,
he was being beaten up
and he was trying to get away.

40:01.067 --> 40:06.489
He finds this space,
it's dark and tiny,
but he's safe there.

40:06.573 --> 40:08.533
And he could see outside
through a small crack,

40:08.616 --> 40:10.326
he could see the sun again.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.454
And that's where he dies?

40:12.537 --> 40:13.955
With a smile on his face.

40:15.373 --> 40:18.668
Like it's the happiest
he's been in forever.

40:18.752 --> 40:23.381
So when you found these bones,
what did you do with them?

40:23.465 --> 40:25.050
Well, I just left
them where they fell.

40:26.718 --> 40:29.554
You don't think it might
be an idea to put them back?

40:41.232 --> 40:43.193
I don't think this
is a very good idea.

40:44.903 --> 40:47.614
You'd rather stay
in the apartment by yourself?

40:48.281 --> 40:50.241
Right.

40:50.325 --> 40:52.410
Now, this guy
that you've been seeing, yeah?

40:52.494 --> 40:54.454
They did bad things to him.

40:54.537 --> 40:57.582
I mean, maybe hanging himself
was his way out,

40:57.665 --> 40:59.417
his way of finding peace.

40:59.501 --> 41:01.711
Oh.
Mr. Happy, you, aren't you?

41:03.380 --> 41:05.048
You disturbed his peace.

41:06.174 --> 41:07.676
It's that way.

41:11.096 --> 41:12.514
Let's get this done.

41:20.730 --> 41:22.065
(SCREAMS)

41:22.148 --> 41:23.650
Ellie!

41:23.733 --> 41:25.527
The bones. Go!

41:32.158 --> 41:33.284
(GRUNTING)

41:58.435 --> 42:00.937
Ellie, you okay?

42:04.232 --> 42:05.442
It's done.

42:08.903 --> 42:11.448
What are you smiling at?

42:11.531 --> 42:14.367
Honestly, I had no idea
that was going to work.

42:17.037 --> 42:18.246
Come on.

42:23.168 --> 42:25.128
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

42:26.838 --> 42:29.966
Should really fix this lock.

42:30.050 --> 42:32.761
Dan said that Kate's moved on.
That means
there's a room going.

42:32.844 --> 42:35.889
-Even after today?
-Today is exactly
why I need to be here.

42:35.972 --> 42:37.640
See, I don't get you.

42:37.724 --> 42:39.809
Whatever's
happening to me, Max,
I think this place is why.

42:40.894 --> 42:42.145
What makes you think that?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.900
Just a feeling.
