00:00.001 --> 00:03.535
     (relaxed violin tones)

01:01.429 --> 01:05.230
   (soft country guitar music)

01:22.216 --> 01:26.285
      (machinery whirring)

01:29.356 --> 01:34.359
         (wind howling)

02:17.738 --> 02:21.573

03:18.832 --> 03:20.532

         new Bison hand?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.726
          That's right.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.361

      the back of the truck

03:49.363 --> 03:51.597

  ain't got all day, come on.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.399
        (engine humming)

03:57.938 --> 03:59.004
         YY Pucketts.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.408
          Jim McNeely.
     [YY] Good to meet you.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.846
       How long you been
       working for Bison?

04:08.816 --> 04:09.948
   Shit, I've been with these

04:09.950 --> 04:11.516
 son-bitches since they started.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.952
    Funded by some old rich
  outfit up there outta Dallas

04:13.954 --> 04:15.954
      that don't know shit
      between goddamn air.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.623
    Hell them son a bitches
   I've been doing this still

04:17.625 --> 04:20.492
  for forever started out just
  like where you're starting.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.828
          You a weevil?
          [Jim] A what?

04:22.830 --> 04:25.430
     A boll-weevil, somebody
      who don't know shit.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.033
    That's a fella that ain't
 never been out to an oil patch.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.569
        [Jim] What do you
      reckon I'll be doing?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.337
     The first thing they're
       gonna do is they're

04:32.339 --> 04:34.039
  gonna have your ass out there
    goddamn diggin' ditches.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.474
 The next thing they gonna have

04:35.476 --> 04:36.908
      you do is buckin'up
        four inch pipe.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.777
      You get ready to get
      a dose of that shit.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.680
  I used to have two nuts, now
   both of 'em's up my belly.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.484
    I'll tell you right now,
         you'll need to

04:45.486 --> 04:46.752
 the break quarter and lay down.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.019
      I've seen guys didn't
       bathe for four days

04:48.022 --> 04:51.390
      they was so god-dang
     tired to get in there.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.825
        Thank you kindly
        for the ride, YY.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.761
 You can thank me in two weeks.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.898
     Do me a favor son, you
      tell that Cap Bruner

04:59.900 --> 05:03.335
      that YY Pucketts said
       to go fuck himself!

05:03.337 --> 05:04.403
           (laughing)

05:05.639 --> 05:06.571
            Oh, wait.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.373
            Hold up!

05:19.386 --> 05:20.419
            (knocks)

05:20.421 --> 05:22.421
             Hello.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.689
         Name's McNeely.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.757
    Hell, I know who you are.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.859
  Another favor from corporate.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.998
      Well I'm Dent Paxton,
       a friend to all men

05:33.000 --> 05:35.600
      so long as they don't
       ask anything of me.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.903
  Well I'm here, what do I do?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.640
    You can write, I presume?

05:47.381 --> 05:52.451
   You'll be in bunkhouse 1,
  bunk number 3, you got that?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.754
       Okay, now it's time
      for the free lecture.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.123
 Welcome to jolly Camp Dead Lake

05:58.125 --> 06:01.526
     of that great octopus,
     the Bison Oil Company.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.929
    Our sole purpose out here
     is to get that stinkin'

06:03.931 --> 06:06.531
      crude oil out of the
   ground and move it on down

06:06.533 --> 06:09.935
  the pipeline where it can be
 made into gasoline and dollars.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.605
   You'll be assigned to Cap
  Bruner's gang, God help you.

06:13.607 --> 06:16.608
   That's the connection gang,
 they do the oil field plumbing.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.779
     It don't sound so bad.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.415
      Buddy, I don't know
     what you've been doing

06:23.417 --> 06:26.084
 but whatever it is, I guarantee
   you it's better than this.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.489
        My advice to you
        is run like hell

06:30.491 --> 06:32.391
      because you'll either
      get run off in a week

06:32.393 --> 06:33.792
     or what's worse, you'll
      want to prove you're

06:33.794 --> 06:36.862
   a real tough character and
    get indentured for life.

06:36.864 --> 06:40.866
     Look, I ain't planning
       on gettin' run off

06:40.868 --> 06:44.936
  or becoming anybody's slave,
     I got plans of my own.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.139
        Well tough titty
        buddy, all hopes

06:47.141 --> 06:49.541
    and illusions are blasted
       to pieces out here.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.843
      Fair warning, go back
     to where you came from.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.148
  I got no place to go back to.

07:03.624 --> 07:07.659
     (relaxed violin music)

07:08.695 --> 07:10.762
      [Mazie] Jim McNeely,
     you better wait for me.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.704
  [Madelon] I gather you think
  you are in love with Mazie.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.541
   It ain't a thinking matter
    Mrs. Wales, I know I am.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.379
           Listen Jim,

07:27.380 --> 07:28.012
 I don't think it's for the best

07:28.015 --> 07:30.182
       that you and Mazie
        see one another.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.824
    [Peaches] What the hell?

07:38.826 --> 07:41.092
      Who's that layin' up
      in your best, Buster?

07:41.094 --> 07:44.529
   Look, he's got his fucking
      shoes on in my bed.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.833
   You keep your goddamn dirty
   clodhoppers off my sheets.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.167
            (laughs)

07:49.169 --> 07:50.602
      Hey, what's the idea?

07:50.604 --> 07:53.038
     The clerk feller told
     me to take bunk three.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.973
   That queer don't know shit.

07:54.975 --> 07:59.044
  This boll-weevil must be one
   of them college athletes.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.613
     He looks like a little
     two-bit hotshot to me.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.982
        Ain't that right?

08:05.619 --> 08:07.252
        Hotshot, you got
       dirt in those ears?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.221
        [Jim] I answer to
        the name McNeely.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.058
   [Buster] Know your goddamn
     place, you stay down.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.660
          Get off him.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.261
       [Buster] You leave
     this bunk be, hotshot.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.001
             Go on.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.639
            Assholes.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.709
       (soft violin tones)

08:31.078 --> 08:32.143
     (rock hits sheet metal)

08:42.655 --> 08:44.523
       [Jim] I got plans.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.691
        [Mrs. Wales] Face
         the facts, Jim.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.794
      You're a checker in a
    grocery store and that is

08:49.796 --> 08:53.198
     all you're equipped by
 background or education to be.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.867
         Piece of shit.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.535
      [Mrs. Wales] I want
     you to see my husband.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.271
    He has important friends,

08:59.273 --> 09:01.273
         he'll get you a
       good job somewhere.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.010
 Perhaps out in the oil fields.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.011
            (screams)

09:08.282 --> 09:12.017
  (anxious music chord rising)

09:12.019 --> 09:15.220
         (men grunting)

09:23.997 --> 09:24.930
              Ort!

09:25.832 --> 09:26.998
      Take that boll-weevil

09:27.000 --> 09:29.801
     and get to piss-antin'
          them joints.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.004
       By God, you'd best
         keep up today.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.210
     Just hook your hand in
     the belt, do like I do.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.347
        When I say hump,
    heister-up and take off.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.683
Ain't nothin' but back and guts.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.284
           All right.
           Here we go.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.152
              Hump.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.286
            (grunts)

09:48.288 --> 09:49.354
           Step back!

09:53.360 --> 09:54.826
    Looks like hotshot's eyes

09:54.828 --> 09:57.362
        gonna bug out of
        his fucking head.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.297
     Why don't you go ahead
     and check him, Peaches?

10:01.301 --> 10:03.368
        Goddamn you sorry
        ass boll-weevil.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.771
       Are you trying to
      get somebody killed?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.013
            (grunts)

10:20.354 --> 10:21.286
           (grunting)

10:24.958 --> 10:25.890
           (grunting)

10:32.833 --> 10:34.899
     (anxious violin music)

10:34.901 --> 10:35.934
            (grunts)

10:37.104 --> 10:38.036
            (shrieks)

10:53.387 --> 10:57.656
       (crickets chirping)

11:14.775 --> 11:16.307
        [Jim] What gives,
         you little rat?

11:16.309 --> 11:18.243
 That's right, I'm a little rat

11:18.245 --> 11:20.311
 and this little rat'll bite ya.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.847
             (slap)

11:22.849 --> 11:24.983
            (grunts)

11:32.292 --> 11:35.860
      (mechanical creaking)

11:35.862 --> 11:39.164
     (relaxed violin music)

12:06.993 --> 12:09.194
   Move your ass, boll-weevil.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.267
         [Ort] Come on.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.268
            Come on.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.404
          There ya go.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.439
       All right everybody
          up, let's go.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.347
 (relaxed country guitar music)

12:58.411 --> 13:01.246
        [Cap] All right,
        that's breeeeak!

13:03.950 --> 13:05.850
     Yeah, not you McNeely.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.956
     (relaxed violin music)

13:47.360 --> 13:49.561
      Been expecting you,
     just didn't know when.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.397
            You win.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.599
    I win, do I get a trophy?

13:54.601 --> 13:57.335
          You said it,
      nothing here for me.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.653
          [Dent] Look.

13:58.654 --> 13:59.970
 Personally I don't give a damn.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.941
         It's completely
        immaterial to me.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.609
       But I hate to give
       those Neanderthal

14:04.611 --> 14:06.544
      bastards the pleasure
       of running you off.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.946
         I can't do it.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.614
      [Dent] You came here
    with something to prove.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.418
     Now I don't know to who

14:13.420 --> 14:15.086
     but I do see it in you.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.423
           Besides...

14:19.926 --> 14:21.926
         you don't have
     anything to go back to.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.268
            Sit down.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.557
       Can I get a raise?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.026
         (Dent chuckles)

14:55.028 --> 14:59.230
       (slow tempo country
          guitar tones)

15:02.002 --> 15:03.468
        [Cap] All right,
      puttin' you in pairs

15:03.470 --> 15:06.070
    today and see if we can't
      spread out the line.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.006
   Cotton, you go with Scrap.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.275
             Buster,

15:10.277 --> 15:11.542
         you've got Jim.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.088
   You're going down, hotshot.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.360
     (anxious guitar tones)

15:35.502 --> 15:37.235
   Buster, can I talk to you?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.945
         Hot damn, that
       must've stung good.

15:49.449 --> 15:54.085
   Somehow you've got the idea
   that you need to break me.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.087
    You're gonna leave me be

15:56.089 --> 15:59.424
       from here on out,
       if you wanna live.

15:59.426 --> 16:04.495
   Don't think I'm gonna fight
   you fair. That I won't do.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.166
      And you got something
          to say to me,

16:08.168 --> 16:12.236
        you call me by my
      name. That's McNeely.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.373
      (guttural screaming)

16:22.082 --> 16:26.217
(mid tempo country guitar music)

16:41.267 --> 16:42.200
             Buster!

16:44.137 --> 16:46.070
    Shut up, you little rat.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.739
    ¶ Call my black cat back

16:47.741 --> 16:50.375
            (laughs)

16:50.377 --> 16:55.446
  ¶ Well I get up on Monday and
   I call my black cat back ¶

16:57.717 --> 16:59.484
 ¶ My black cat comes a-running

16:59.486 --> 17:02.754
         ¶ And the hound
      dogs, they get back ¶

17:02.756 --> 17:06.391
      ¶ Get back, way back

17:19.705 --> 17:21.138
          Howdy fellas.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.473
       You a boll-weevil?

17:23.476 --> 17:26.109
        Nah, I'm Clayton
        LeMane the Third.

17:27.747 --> 17:28.713
          Jim McNeely.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.615
   Damn good to meet ya, Jim.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.418
     Quit your fraternizing
  Stabber and get back to work.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.554
     Just like I was saying
      Mr. LeMane, there's

17:36.556 --> 17:38.723
  a lot to gettin' a days work
    out of a bunch of hands.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.591
   [Clayton] That sure is good
        to know Captain,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.593
  seeing as I'm a hand now too.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.062
         I'll be sure to
          put in a word

17:44.064 --> 17:46.130
      with my uncle for how
      amiable you've been.

17:49.069 --> 17:52.670
   (soft country guitar music)

17:54.274 --> 17:57.475
     Pay up son, them beers
     don't buy themselves.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.514
        You know why I'm
       so poor and measly?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.716
    Because my daddy was such
   a tight old son of a bitch,

18:05.718 --> 18:08.853
      he used to pay me 10
    cents not to have supper.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.421
        Then that bastard
         would charge me

18:10.423 --> 18:12.824
      a dime every morning
         for breakfast.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.826
  Meanest man there ever were.

18:14.828 --> 18:16.494
 It's a wonder I growed at all.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.096
   Pity you did, you old liar.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.566
     No sir, I ain't lying,
       that there I know.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.435
        (horse neighing)

18:27.774 --> 18:29.841
    Oh Lord, here she comes.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.877
            Hi Dent.
             Ma'am.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.148
   Hey ma'am, what can I get?

18:37.150 --> 18:40.651
     Boy, I am in love with
     that engineer's wife.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.587
 You are just a randy old goat,

18:42.589 --> 18:44.155
  what do you know about love?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.723
      When you sack up with
     someone you still wanna

18:45.725 --> 18:48.459
  kiss her in the morning when
  you're through, that is it.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.827
   You better shut your trap.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.329
    If Clyde Montgomery hears
      you talking that way

18:51.331 --> 18:53.831
     about his wife, you'll
    be outta camp yesterday.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.234
        I bet she flangs
      that silly Montgomery

18:56.236 --> 18:59.270
      around 'til he don't
     know which way west is.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.606
        [Jim] She sure is
      something to look at.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.142
     Yeah but lookin' at it
  ain't getting it, now is it?

19:04.144 --> 19:05.543
    Which reminds me fellas,

19:05.545 --> 19:08.212
      I got some business
     to transact in Odessa.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.515
      Take the strain off.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.449
             Adios.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.186
         [Dent] If they
       cut his head open,

19:15.188 --> 19:18.156
   wouldn't nothing come out
   but a pile of cockroaches.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.657
      Ain't that the truth.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.697
        Excuse me, ma'am.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.832
            Bye Dent.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.766
             Ma'am.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.607
             Mm-mm.

19:38.211 --> 19:38.943
               Hm.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.449
      (machinery clanking)

19:45.451 --> 19:48.686
     (relaxed violin music)

19:51.391 --> 19:52.456
         [Jim] What are
       you doing out here

19:52.458 --> 19:54.525
   so far from the other rigs?

19:54.526 --> 19:56.593
   [Barry] I'm seeing if this
   wildcat's worth drilling.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.828
        The damn lease is
        about to expire,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.597
      so I gotta see what's
      going on underneath.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.833
   I'm a geologist for Bison,
      name's Barry Wakely.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.302
             Barry,

20:04.304 --> 20:05.636
        Jim, Jim McNeely.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.539
      We cut the damn hole.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.976
 Now it's time to see how smart
   or how dumb we really are.

20:11.978 --> 20:15.813
         We can pay more
      money to complete the
      well or shut her in.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.815
    Who makes that decision?

20:17.817 --> 20:19.350
         Me, that's who.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.651
     Me and this swab test.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.486
              Oou.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.266
            It's oil.
    [Barry] Yeah, that's oil.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.401
         Glad I checked.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.269
            (laughs)

20:39.806 --> 20:42.273
    [Jim] Ever thought about
     going out on your own?

20:43.476 --> 20:44.675
     I've thought about it.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.279
         Well if you run
       across an oil field

20:48.281 --> 20:51.315
    nobody's found yet, maybe
     you and I can grab it.

20:51.317 --> 20:51.949
          Coker field.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.287
        As in Coker City?

20:56.289 --> 20:58.422
         The old codger
       won't lease it out.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.558
      Convince him and your
       name will be known

21:00.560 --> 21:03.494
   for 14 counties, hell maybe
  all the way up to Fort Worth.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.896
 A couple broke bastards like us

21:05.898 --> 21:07.632
can't compete with the big boys.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.768
       Good thing I enjoy
      sniffin' them rocks.

21:13.039 --> 21:13.971
           (chuckles)

21:20.480 --> 21:21.912
        That damn Pluto's
         as worthless as

21:21.914 --> 21:24.915
     a one-legged man in an
      ass kicking contest.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.817
        Spent the entire
        day behind a bush

21:26.819 --> 21:29.420
       and Cap didn't do a
     goddamn thing about it.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.472
         Why should he?

21:31.473 --> 21:33.523
     He's the nephew of the
    Vice-President of Bison.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.326
          A blue blood
      through and through.

21:37.697 --> 21:41.032
      The luck lands on the
 sorriest, most worthless souls.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.833
Good work out there today, boys.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.869
      How much we got now?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.538
           I've got..

21:47.540 --> 21:51.042
             $3,221.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.443
              Oou.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.678
       Tell you what let's
       do, let's take that

21:53.680 --> 21:57.448
       3,221 and let's go
       down to old Mexico.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.484
  We'll get us a big old house
 with plenty of tequila and some

22:00.486 --> 22:03.721
   cute little muchachos and
   man, we'll have us a time.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.089
   And when we're cashed out?

22:05.091 --> 22:07.892
        Well then we come
      back here and save up

22:07.894 --> 22:11.395
      another 3,221 and do
       it all over again.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.097
       Oh goddamn, I like
        the sound of it.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.665
      It sure sounds sweet.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.437
     This here is my ticket
      outta here, fellas.

22:20.540 --> 22:24.375
      Indentured for life
      my ass, sweetie pie.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.696
        Where you headed?

22:28.697 --> 22:31.415
 [Jim] To town, you inquisitive
   little bastard, by myself.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.352
           To Mexico.

22:38.024 --> 22:42.093
     [YY] Tell Cap Bruner to
     kiss my ass, ha ha ha!

22:43.429 --> 22:47.631
       (slow tempo country
          guitar music)

23:08.688 --> 23:10.788
          [Lee] Hello.
          [Jim] Hello.

23:10.790 --> 23:14.558
 [Lee] It's a lovely afternoon.
[Jim] I hadn't noticed 'til now.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.928
   It must be the contrast, it
   was a real scorcher today.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.765
      Yeah it was, fella on
       the rig said he saw

23:20.767 --> 23:23.901
    a lizard crawl up a steam
     pipe just to cool off.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.136
             Really?

23:25.138 --> 23:27.571
     Fella said it, I can't
     say about the lizard.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.174
      I'm headed into town
      to get some candles.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.542
         My husband said
        the electricity's

23:31.544 --> 23:32.943
 going out for a while tonight?

23:32.945 --> 23:35.479
   [Jim] Yeah, they're cuttin'
      a new pumping station

23:35.481 --> 23:37.948
   into the power line but it
   shouldn't be out too long.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.084
       Is that why you're
      going into town too?

23:41.687 --> 23:43.087
          For candles?

23:43.089 --> 23:44.755
        And razorblades.

23:45.658 --> 23:46.757
       Do you want a ride?

23:49.762 --> 23:51.862
       Sure, thanks ma'am.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.109
      [Lee] I don't make a
     practice of picking up

24:05.110 --> 24:07.477
  strange men in the middle of
 the road but I recognized you.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.181
 [Jim] It's mighty kind of you.

24:10.183 --> 24:13.684
     (relaxed guitar music)

24:14.554 --> 24:16.720
   [Lee] Tell me Mr. McNeely,

24:16.722 --> 24:19.457
      how are you enjoying
     your stay in Dead Lake?

24:20.893 --> 24:21.959
      You can call me Jim.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.763
   But if I call you Jim, then
     you should call me Lee.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.534
  I'll call you Mrs. Montgomery
      like I'm supposed to.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.605
     I guess it wouldn't be
     proper, what a world.

24:35.942 --> 24:36.874
           It sure is.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.678
 Me being me and you being you.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.146
   I didn't mean it like that.

24:42.148 --> 24:46.550
     (pensive guitar music)

24:46.552 --> 24:47.818
       [Lee] Thanks Arnie.
        [Arnie] You bet.

24:47.820 --> 24:51.555
     Arnie, I'm gonna need
  another pack of razorblades.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.127
       Let me get a couple
         Schlitz to go.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.097
           Thank you.

25:02.668 --> 25:03.501
       Thanks for waiting.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.235
          [Lee] Mm hmm.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.875
     [Jim] How about a cold
     beer to ease us along?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.143
          [Lee] Are you
       offering me a beer?

25:14.614 --> 25:17.615
   No, I'm just trying to pay
    you for the ride is all.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.821
           Thank you.

25:24.657 --> 25:28.592
  (relaxed guitar, piano music)

25:36.035 --> 25:38.936
   I had almost forgotten how
    good a cold beer tastes.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.673
  If you had a million dollars,

25:42.675 --> 25:44.208
 you couldn't enjoy it any more.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.712
       I'll remember that.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.616
    [Jim] I'll tell you what,
      you can call me 'Hey'

25:53.920 --> 25:56.554
     and I'll call you 'Say'
   and then next time we meet,

25:56.556 --> 26:00.090
       you could say "Hey,
         how you doing?"

26:00.092 --> 26:03.827
     And I'll respond "Say,
       good to see you."

26:05.164 --> 26:06.096
          I like that.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.905
      [Lee] Thank you, you
      should get out here,

26:15.741 --> 26:17.074
          people talk.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.278
          Thanks again.

26:42.134 --> 26:45.936
   (tepid violin, piano music)

26:56.816 --> 27:00.784
          ¶ Da, da da ¶

27:00.786 --> 27:03.053
          ¶ Da da da ¶

27:05.291 --> 27:07.825
    [Jim] All right, turn it.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.792
            Come on.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.695
         ¶ I love you ¶

27:11.697 --> 27:14.064
  [Jim] One, two, three, snap!

27:14.066 --> 27:15.366
    [Cap] Come on, get it in.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.034
     [Jim] One, two, three.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.702
              Damn!

27:18.704 --> 27:20.137
        One, two, three.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.071
              Snap!

27:26.946 --> 27:32.016
    ¶ Of all the things that
   ever lived, I choose you ¶

27:34.320 --> 27:36.020
         ¶ To rue me, ¶

27:36.022 --> 27:41.091
      ¶ my Roooooosemary ¶

27:41.794 --> 27:43.694
          (shattering)

27:43.696 --> 27:45.696
        [Jim] All right
       boys, let's drink.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.266
  [Cap] Just a goddamn minute.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.136
 You ain't drawin' enough money

27:52.138 --> 27:54.438
        to be givin' the
      orders to these men.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.845
      A man don't live that
       makes enough money

28:01.847 --> 28:05.282
       to tell me when I
      can and won't drink.

28:17.997 --> 28:21.765
  [Cap] All right you scraps of
  nothing... get back to work!

28:29.408 --> 28:30.474
        [Lee] Thank you.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.945
          Razorblades?

28:35.815 --> 28:36.747
              Yeah.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.183
            Come on.

28:41.020 --> 28:42.986
 [Lee] Mazie's a beautiful name,
   you might still marry her.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.889
  I got pretty good instincts.
           [Jim] No.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.491
        All that's over
       and done with now.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.994
      Besides, she doesn't
    bother me anymore, only--

28:50.996 --> 28:51.962
        [Lee] Only what?

28:52.998 --> 28:54.965
    Say what you're thinking.

28:54.967 --> 28:58.235
     (relaxed violin music)

29:03.876 --> 29:06.510
   You should've just dropped
      me off at the gate.

29:08.948 --> 29:09.880
             I know.

29:22.795 --> 29:25.295
 You fill up my whole head, Lee.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.230
              What?

29:28.234 --> 29:29.299
           It's true.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.270
      Don't talk like that.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.409
    [Lee] What are you doing?

29:54.093 --> 29:55.025
           [Lee] Jim.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.401
     Oh God, Get off of me.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.473
            Get out!

30:09.475 --> 30:10.407
           I'm sorry.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.276
           I'm sorry.

30:13.512 --> 30:14.945
        I'm sorry, uh...

30:14.947 --> 30:16.914
 Please get out before I scream!

30:16.916 --> 30:18.382
  I'm sorry, I just thought...

30:31.096 --> 30:32.029
            You know,

30:32.932 --> 30:35.065
     I've got instincts too.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.903
       You don't love the
     man you're married to.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.006
    Stabber, come over here.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.207
          Jesus Christ.

31:18.143 --> 31:19.877
[Pluto] Tonight's my last night.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.347
     I'm saying sayonara to
     this shit hole manyana.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.286
    You'll be missed, Pluto.

31:29.288 --> 31:32.289
  Hey, what do you say me and
 you hit the town to celebrate?

31:32.291 --> 31:34.391
      I got some moolah...

31:34.393 --> 31:36.960
     They paid me off and it
     ain't even payday yet.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.429
     I don't think so, man.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.999
  Hey the next time you see me,

31:42.001 --> 31:43.934
  you'll be calling me El Jefe.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.672
        Or maybe I'll be
      calling you boss man

31:48.674 --> 31:50.474
         and you'll be
      running these gangs.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.345
     Come on, just a couple
        drinks, Stabber.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.682
           Okay then.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.684
 OK, that's what I like to hear.

32:00.686 --> 32:04.221
     (up tempo violin music)

32:05.557 --> 32:09.960
[Pluto] Don't you think that old
Pluto is gonna forget about you.

32:09.962 --> 32:14.364
    You oughta be Cap's boss
   and I got a toast to make.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.235
      Ladies and gentlemen,

32:19.171 --> 32:20.304
              here

32:20.306 --> 32:23.473
  is the best, damn pipe liner

32:23.475 --> 32:26.677
      in all of West Texas.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.378
    Sit your ass down, Pluto.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.614
       [Pluto] I give you

32:30.616 --> 32:33.717
        the one, the only

32:33.719 --> 32:34.584
             Jim...

32:34.586 --> 32:36.620
        Stabber McNeely.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.022
   ¶ Just a little more love,
     then I'd be dreaming ¶

32:39.024 --> 32:39.690
         (glass breaks)

32:39.692 --> 32:41.558
           (throws up)

32:41.560 --> 32:44.528
      ¶ I could do, yeah ¶

32:46.598 --> 32:49.399
      That's it Jim, you'll
        feel better now.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.371
   You're a bonafide drunkard
   now, welcome to the club.

32:54.373 --> 32:55.572
         [Cap] Move it!

33:07.753 --> 33:11.388
     (anxious violin tones)

33:11.390 --> 33:14.992
     Get up from there, you
  gold-bricking son of a bitch.

33:19.131 --> 33:22.065
 Think you're a little too smart
   to be laying pipe no more?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.235
      You're just asking to
      get your ass run off.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.608
    You need to get the drain
      plate off that tank.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.777
      It ain't bleeding the
   bullshit out of the bottom.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.780
 Maybe that'll wake your ass up.

33:39.385 --> 33:42.652
     (anxious violin tones)

33:59.038 --> 34:01.772
 - That Cap's a son of a bitch.
           - Yes sir.

34:16.355 --> 34:21.425
[Jim] (singing) Florina, Florina

34:22.293 --> 34:26.797
 ¶ Where'd you stay last night ¶

34:27.533 --> 34:32.202
     ¶ Florina, Flori--na! ¶

34:32.838 --> 34:36.840
 ¶ Where'd you go last night? ¶

34:36.842 --> 34:40.844
  ¶ Come home in the morning ¶

34:40.846 --> 34:44.414
   ¶ And the sun don't shine ¶

34:44.416 --> 34:49.319
    ¶ Florina, Floriiinaaa ¶

34:49.321 --> 34:53.223
 ¶ Where'd you stay last night ¶

34:53.225 --> 34:54.424
        [Jim] Florina...

34:54.426 --> 34:57.527
       That swamp gas is
      gettin' to his head.

34:57.529 --> 35:02.299
  It'll kill his ass unless we
   get him outta there quick.

35:02.301 --> 35:06.703
        ¶ Go home in the
      morning and the sun ¶

35:11.877 --> 35:15.145
       (metallic clanking)

35:16.281 --> 35:17.214
              Jim.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.753
              Jim?

35:27.326 --> 35:29.593
           (coughing)

35:35.300 --> 35:37.701
        Get up, you sorry
         son of a bitch.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.242
          Come on, Jim.
        Come on, get him.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.649
         (thuds, grunts)

35:53.852 --> 35:55.919
       [Men] Get him son.
            Come on.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.259
          [Men] Get up.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.930
      Yeah! That a boy Jim.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.269
 (anxious violin, guitar music)

36:13.438 --> 36:15.405
           (men cheer)

36:34.393 --> 36:35.659
           My boy Jim.

36:40.199 --> 36:42.499
       You piece of shit.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.952
  (soft piano and violin music)

37:54.840 --> 37:57.474
       (crickets chirping)

37:57.476 --> 38:00.477
       (soft piano music)

38:24.903 --> 38:25.835
              Hey.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.573
              Say.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.709
 I heard all about what you did.

38:38.317 --> 38:40.750
 You know I'm leaving for good.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.818
           I figured.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.998
        Where you headed?

39:00.005 --> 39:04.874
     (relaxed guitar music)

39:05.944 --> 39:09.446
         (birds singing)

39:25.364 --> 39:27.764
      [Jim] Dent, I did it.

39:27.766 --> 39:29.566
          I married her

39:31.670 --> 39:33.636
and now you and everyone in this

39:33.638 --> 39:37.774
     God-forsaken world can
     call her Lee McNeely.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.542
         How about that?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.977
          (Lee laughs)

39:43.949 --> 39:46.449
      You always asked what
        my money was for.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.755
    Well you'll be content to
  know I found some use for it.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.391
         And who knows?

39:54.393 --> 39:57.894
     Maybe someday I'll need
     some good, cheap labor

39:57.896 --> 40:00.597
      if you happen to know
       anyone interested.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.936
              Well?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.671
    It smells delicious, hon.

40:08.673 --> 40:11.841
       Don't gimme that,
       tell me something.

40:13.044 --> 40:17.147
     We are the sole owners
        of the sorriest,

40:17.149 --> 40:21.084
   oldest oil field servicing
  company in all of West Texas.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.787
         Ooh, I knew it.
     [Jim] Oh calm down now.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.555
       I made a bad deal.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.957
        I bought out Mrs.
      Sullivan on the worst

40:27.959 --> 40:31.060
       layaway plan known
       to man and maybe,

40:31.062 --> 40:35.198
        just maybe, if I
      work 18 hours a day,

40:35.200 --> 40:37.934
        seven days a week
      and give up breakfast

40:37.936 --> 40:41.938
   and chewing gum and picture
   shows and I get an amazing

40:41.940 --> 40:45.041
  string of luck, we might just
  be able to make the payments.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.643
          I don't care.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.978
    You will care when we're
    eating beans every night.

40:50.048 --> 40:53.049
          I love beans.
            [Jim] Oh!

40:53.051 --> 40:55.819
           (laughing)

40:55.821 --> 40:59.722
  (upbeat country guitar music)

41:17.576 --> 41:19.943
     You know, the surefire
       way to get through

41:19.945 --> 41:22.812
     to an old timer is to
     get down on his level.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.015
        Make him laugh.
     I know what I'm doing.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.519
  I know you do, big boss man.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.054
            Shut up.

41:43.702 --> 41:44.701
           Mr. Coker?

42:00.185 --> 42:02.118
     My name's Jim McNeely.

42:05.824 --> 42:09.592
That road you just come on in on

42:09.594 --> 42:12.762
       don't lead nowhere
        but right here.

42:12.764 --> 42:15.532
      Mr. Coker, I heard it
       said in Odessa that

42:15.534 --> 42:18.034
      you'd shoot the next
      fella that came out

42:18.036 --> 42:20.737
       here asking about
    leasing the Coker ranch.

42:21.940 --> 42:24.641
  I ain't a lease broker and I

42:24.643 --> 42:26.676
       damn sure don't aim
      to get shot, neither.

42:26.678 --> 42:29.178
     What in the confounded
       hell do you want?

42:29.180 --> 42:31.881
        Not a damn thing
        sir, unless you'd

42:33.218 --> 42:35.885
     spare a little of that
   Beechnut you're chewin' on.

42:46.831 --> 42:50.199
 They say you're a fool 'cause
 you refuse to lease your land.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.869
        You'd rather let
        'em rob you blind

42:52.871 --> 42:54.837
         than get what's
        rightfully yours.

43:01.146 --> 43:02.979
    Shit with what they say.

43:02.981 --> 43:06.349
     I don't agree with 'em
     or I wouldn't be here.

43:06.351 --> 43:09.619
    I just think you haven't
  been offered a fair deal yet.

43:10.689 --> 43:14.757
     You need a partner who
    can help you get the oil

43:15.760 --> 43:17.894
    out of the ground before
       they suck you dry.

43:28.607 --> 43:31.307
        (Coker laughing)

43:32.277 --> 43:34.243
    You're the worst goddamn

43:34.245 --> 43:36.946
        tobacco chewer I
      ever seen in my life.

43:36.948 --> 43:38.147
 I never claimed to be an expert

43:38.149 --> 43:39.949
       in chewing tobacco
       or anything else.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.886
       I'm just a poor boy
        trying to get by.

43:52.764 --> 43:56.933
(mid tempo country guitar music)

44:28.400 --> 44:31.668
        (metal clanking)

44:34.239 --> 44:37.040
         (bird chirping)

44:43.782 --> 44:45.048
       Take a look at it.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.918
         [Jim] Driller!
 Let's test this son of a bitch.

44:57.862 --> 44:59.829
            Goddamn.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.331
 Driller, give me two more feet.

45:17.882 --> 45:20.183
           (cheering)

45:26.758 --> 45:29.459
 [Barry] You did it, you did it.

45:32.764 --> 45:34.497
     [Jim] We're in the oil
      business now, sugar.

45:44.876 --> 45:47.176
          [Jim] Barry.
          What is this?

45:48.246 --> 45:50.413
    That's your 1% interest.

45:52.016 --> 45:55.151
      But Jim, I'm happy to
       help an old friend.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.320
         Hell with that.

45:57.322 --> 45:59.355
   I wouldn't have even known
  about this deal without you.

46:00.925 --> 46:01.991
         Thank you, Jim.

46:02.227 --> 46:06.362
     (relaxed violin music)

46:33.224 --> 46:38.094
     So you're telling me,
  you got no geological stats,

46:38.096 --> 46:43.166
  no geophysics, nothing but a
 lot of hot air and high hopes?

46:43.401 --> 46:45.134
     And cheap leases, sir.

46:45.403 --> 46:48.104
  $6 an acre, can't beat that.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.207
           Not a uh...

46:51.209 --> 46:54.210
    deal for the risk-averse,
        that's for sure.

46:56.381 --> 47:00.316
     Not exactly my idea of
   aggressive expansion, Dent.

47:00.318 --> 47:05.254
   Well I'm no geologist and
Scurry County's not oil country.

47:05.256 --> 47:08.257
      However, it's a shit
       load of cheap land

47:08.259 --> 47:10.259
          in West Texas
      without a hole in it.

47:11.262 --> 47:12.395
    I'm willing to give y'all

47:12.397 --> 47:15.031
     until tomorrow morning
        to consider it.

47:16.534 --> 47:20.336
    Otherwise I'm just gonna
    shop it on down the road.

47:30.615 --> 47:35.351
        (relaxed country
      guitar, violin music)

48:28.406 --> 48:30.673
    Santa Rita, gimme a sign.

48:48.426 --> 48:52.428
 (relaxed violin, guitar music)

48:56.701 --> 48:57.600
            Hot damn.

49:00.405 --> 49:01.304
            Hot damn.

49:09.147 --> 49:11.080
       To bet it all on a
       stupid horseshoe?

49:12.550 --> 49:13.482
           Goddammit.

49:19.557 --> 49:21.691
     Well, how did it look?

49:21.693 --> 49:23.960
       Hmm, like you said.

49:25.063 --> 49:26.529
  Cheap lease is for a reason.

49:28.032 --> 49:32.568
   You know I was thinking we
  could redo the guest bedroom.

49:33.705 --> 49:35.304
           Redo what?

49:35.306 --> 49:37.173
   We already got a bed and a
   dresser in there already.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.475
      What else do we need?

49:39.477 --> 49:41.510
       We haven't even had
       a guest over once.

49:42.380 --> 49:45.114
I don't know, maybe a kids room.

49:48.453 --> 49:50.152
            You know,

49:50.154 --> 49:51.087
            someday.

49:58.563 --> 50:00.229
              Hon,

50:00.231 --> 50:01.630
         we barely have
       time for you and I.

50:01.632 --> 50:04.000
       How the hell are we
    gonna have time for kids?

50:04.002 --> 50:06.502
      We make time, that's
         how it's done.

50:06.504 --> 50:10.106
      It won't be easy but
       I will have a son

50:10.108 --> 50:13.609
  so I can teach him how to be
  a real cowboy, work the land.

50:16.080 --> 50:16.746
     Cowboy huh, cowboy huh?

50:16.748 --> 50:17.680
            (laughs)

50:18.649 --> 50:19.582
         You want a son?

50:23.021 --> 50:24.320
         ¶ Hello walls ¶

50:24.322 --> 50:26.655
        ¶ Hello, hello ¶

50:26.657 --> 50:31.727
        ¶ How'd things go
         for you today ¶

50:32.430 --> 50:36.065
     ¶ Don't you miss her ¶

50:36.067 --> 50:40.803
¶ Since she up and walked away ¶

50:40.805 --> 50:44.673
       ¶ And I'll bet you
        dread to spend ¶

50:44.675 --> 50:49.712
¶ Another lonely night with me ¶

50:50.782 --> 50:55.284
       ¶ But lonely walls,
     I'll keep you company ¶

50:57.622 --> 50:58.487
              Ted.

50:58.489 --> 50:59.722
        ¶ Hello window ¶

50:59.724 --> 51:01.824
        ¶ Hello, hello ¶

51:01.826 --> 51:04.460
         ¶ Well I see ¶

51:04.462 --> 51:05.528
            Bob, Tom.
              Boss.

51:05.530 --> 51:10.266
    You know I bought a good
    lease with a bad title.

51:10.268 --> 51:11.600
 I got seven days to pay it off.

51:11.602 --> 51:13.536
      Two of the heirs are
       in court right now

51:13.538 --> 51:15.538
        feuding over the
       block that I want.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.807
       So renew the lease
        from both heirs,

51:17.809 --> 51:20.609
    drill it and the royalty
   money will go to the court.

51:20.611 --> 51:22.344
 Then when the suit is settled,

51:22.346 --> 51:24.313
     they'll give it to the
   rightful owner, easy-peasy.

51:24.315 --> 51:25.481
     Hell, I don't even have

51:25.483 --> 51:28.084
       the money to renew
       it from one of 'em.

51:28.086 --> 51:29.819
      Then drill it before
       the lease expires.

51:29.821 --> 51:31.120
         In seven days?

51:31.122 --> 51:34.557
     We need a partner and
    we needed one yesterday.

51:38.329 --> 51:39.528
         (mouths a name)

51:55.713 --> 51:58.848
     Mr. Naylor, my name's
     Jim McNeely, President

51:58.850 --> 52:02.218
     of McNeely Oil Company,
   can I have a word with you?

52:02.220 --> 52:03.385
     What's this all about?

52:03.387 --> 52:05.321
       Can't you see I'm
     having a meeting here?

52:08.226 --> 52:11.260
         Mr. Naylor, I'm
       about to move a rig

52:11.262 --> 52:14.797
     on the Turpin section,
  offsetting your Sheets lease.

52:14.799 --> 52:16.265
 I intend to be making a hole by

52:16.267 --> 52:18.234
 Monday unless someone stops me.

52:20.571 --> 52:22.738
        Hell, I've never
        heard of whatever

52:22.740 --> 52:25.508
    the hell company you're
  supposed to be President of.

52:28.346 --> 52:31.580
   Sir, would you like to hear
   what I have to say or not?

52:34.285 --> 52:36.452
    Guess he liked my speech.

52:41.425 --> 52:42.491
             Hello.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.260
            [Lee] Hi.

52:45.696 --> 52:50.366
    Just how much money are
   you drawing, Mrs. McNeely?

52:50.368 --> 52:53.636
   Not enough to put up with
  you clowns, that's for sure.

53:00.678 --> 53:01.677
          You're fired.

53:03.748 --> 53:05.214
              What?

53:05.216 --> 53:05.948
            Whaaaaat?

53:06.851 --> 53:07.783
          You're fired.

53:09.220 --> 53:09.952
            Oh yeah.

53:09.954 --> 53:14.723
       I'm trading you in
      for a full time wife.

53:14.725 --> 53:18.327
  You can paint up that little
 room you've been talking about.

53:18.329 --> 53:21.597
       Consul just bought
      a piece of our lease

53:21.599 --> 53:24.366
      and hired us to drill
     it, we start on Monday.

53:25.436 --> 53:27.870
       This sly son of a
      silver-tongued devil

53:27.872 --> 53:30.539
       walked over to the
       President of Consul

53:30.541 --> 53:33.209
   Petroleum and sold him the
    damn deal outta nowhere.

53:33.211 --> 53:34.977
             Ah ha.

53:34.979 --> 53:37.213
  I nailed that son of a bitch.

53:37.215 --> 53:38.614
          Yes you did.

53:38.616 --> 53:41.717
     (upbeat trumpet music)

53:41.719 --> 53:44.286
     I've got the prettiest
   girl in the state of Texas.

53:45.890 --> 53:50.960
¶ Cheers, here's to you and me ¶

53:51.762 --> 53:53.963
     ¶ Baby can't you see ¶

53:53.965 --> 53:56.865
y Jim, I've been looking at it..

53:56.867 --> 53:58.434
     It's a great prospect.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.338
           (cheering)

54:02.740 --> 54:07.343
     (upbeat big band music)

54:10.014 --> 54:12.348
            Yes Jim!

54:12.350 --> 54:13.415
           You did it!

54:29.033 --> 54:31.000
              Yes.

54:31.001 --> 54:32.968
 ¶ North, south, east or west ¶

54:32.970 --> 54:36.839
 ¶ We've got whatever it takes ¶

54:36.841 --> 54:40.542
        ¶ We'll make our
       own lucky breaks ¶

54:40.544 --> 54:44.346
         ¶ So clear the
       decks for action ¶

54:44.348 --> 54:47.683
   ¶ Guaranteed satisfaction ¶

54:47.685 --> 54:53.956
       ¶ We'll go all the
      way, stand or fall ¶

54:54.392 --> 54:57.359
          ¶ So cheers ¶

54:57.361 --> 55:00.029
       ¶ To one and all ¶

55:05.336 --> 55:08.837
        So soon, you pass
        me off that soon?

55:08.839 --> 55:12.041
      (upbeat guitar music)

55:18.949 --> 55:21.950
     (relaxed violin music)

55:50.648 --> 55:51.814
           Goddammit.

56:00.658 --> 56:02.891
   [Jim] There's only a rare
   few  of these to be found.

56:06.664 --> 56:07.930
      Now there's one less.

56:13.070 --> 56:15.938
   They'd offered it to me and
   I threw it out the window.

56:18.776 --> 56:21.944
      But you told me not
      to buy cheap leases.

56:21.946 --> 56:23.145
      So now it's my fault?

56:24.482 --> 56:26.582
       So what if you did
       buy Scurry County?

56:27.785 --> 56:29.952
   We'd be sloppy rich by now?

56:29.954 --> 56:32.554
    What would you have that
    you haven't already got?

56:32.556 --> 56:34.456
    A title like millionaire?

56:35.659 --> 56:38.660
      In case you haven't
   heard, I am a millionaire.

56:38.662 --> 56:39.595
           [Lee] Jim.

56:39.597 --> 56:44.166
      No wait, you add up
      the value of the oil

56:44.168 --> 56:47.503
     in the ground and the
     rig and the new office

56:47.505 --> 56:49.605
        building and this
     house that you live in,

56:49.607 --> 56:53.041
  subtract what I owe, there's
    a million dollars left.

56:53.043 --> 56:54.443
     And what does that do?

56:55.513 --> 56:57.112
       What are you gonna
       do with more money?

56:57.114 --> 56:59.815
       Where do you stop
         wanting, when?

57:00.885 --> 57:02.084
      When you really get
      to be a millionaire?

57:02.086 --> 57:04.153
 I am a millionaire, goddammit!

57:04.155 --> 57:05.521
      Well yippee for you.

57:17.668 --> 57:18.600
              Hey.

57:21.639 --> 57:22.571
              Say.

57:24.141 --> 57:26.108
       There's something I
       forgot to tell you.

57:27.878 --> 57:29.211
   We're moving to Fort Worth.

57:31.782 --> 57:32.714
         [Jim] Surprise.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.820
     I knew we were going, I
     just didn't know when.

57:41.158 --> 57:45.093
  (relaxed piano, violin music)

58:23.534 --> 58:26.134
    [Lee] My God, the houses
  just keep on gettin' bigger.

58:26.136 --> 58:29.071
    [Jim] Yeah and the jerks
     that live in 'em too.

58:29.073 --> 58:31.073
       Tomorrow I'm gonna
        show you the new

58:31.075 --> 58:33.609
      headquarters for the
      McNeely Oil Company.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.211
        I'm gonna kick my
       boots up on my desk

58:36.213 --> 58:38.614
       every day and make
       like a big oilman.

58:39.683 --> 58:41.083
       [Lee] When did this
         all come about?

58:41.085 --> 58:42.284
      Dent took care of it.

58:44.822 --> 58:46.822
        What do you think
         about this one?

58:46.824 --> 58:48.924
  It looks like a small castle.

58:48.926 --> 58:51.660
        They're having a
      party, there's music.

58:51.662 --> 58:52.594
               Oh.

58:53.931 --> 58:55.130
          It's for you.

58:55.132 --> 58:57.199
  But I don't know anyone here.

58:57.201 --> 58:58.667
              Yet.

58:58.669 --> 59:01.670
     This is a housewarming
     party honey, for you.

59:01.672 --> 59:04.340
              What?

59:04.341 --> 59:07.009
   This is your new castle and
  since you're the queen of it,

59:10.014 --> 59:11.280
         you get a key.

59:11.282 --> 59:13.282
    Jim, what have you done?

59:14.251 --> 59:15.651
      Don't worry about it.

59:16.620 --> 59:17.553
           We're home.

59:19.557 --> 59:22.791
     (upbeat trumpet music)

59:24.728 --> 59:27.829
        Hey y'all, howdy.

59:27.831 --> 59:29.965
     You traitorous bastard.

59:31.569 --> 59:32.668
      Lookin' great, honey.

59:35.105 --> 59:36.872
         [Jim] Charley.
           Jim, Lee.

59:37.708 --> 59:39.141
          Welcome home.

59:39.143 --> 59:41.276
  It took y'all long enough to
  get out of that dustbowl but

59:41.278 --> 59:43.712
      I trust you'll find
  yourselves comfortable here.

59:43.714 --> 59:46.048
     Excuse me gentlemen if
     I use the powder room.

59:49.753 --> 59:52.688
      Jim McNeely, welcome
      back to Fort Worth.

59:52.690 --> 59:54.823
   You sure have made quite a
   name for yourself out West.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.592
        He certainly has.

59:56.594 --> 59:58.226
   Yeah, I've done all right.

59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.295
     A far cry from the days
    on the schoolyard, right?

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:02.998
 That was a long time ago, Jim.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.233
  Charley here was just telling
  us about your latest streak.

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.970
       Well, Charley tell
       'em about our last

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:10.606
      deal that bought you
       that new Cadillac.

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:13.241
   Maybe we'll get y'all in on
   our Reeves County prospect.

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:16.278
     Sounds all right to me.
      [Jim] Excuse me boys,

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.046
    y'all get a drink or 10.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.618
    One well, one Cadillac,
   easiest money I ever made.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:37.899
You still think you can struggle

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:39.668
         along in this
      little old bungalow?

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:42.304
    Looks like a damn museum.

01:00:42.306 --> 01:00:45.107
      Everyone's impressed,
     repulsed but impressed.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.744
       But that's what you
        wanted, isn't it?

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.879
    You done good, Denty boy.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:52.681
        I even got you a
        little something.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:56.018
      Well open it, dammit.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.688
       Are you proposing?
        [Jim] You wish.

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:06.128
           Thank you.
         For everything.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.934
   Alright. Don't go gettin'
     all sentimental on me.

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:16.071
         I need a drink.

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:18.073
             Buster?

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:23.412
    [Mrs. Wales] Jim McNeely.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.814
        Hello Mrs. Wales.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.282
     You do look wonderful.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.451
         Why thank you.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:31.219
 You look mighty sharp yourself.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.388
   I'm so glad you invited me.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.857
      I just wish Dr. Wales
      had lived to see it.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:38.326
            Come on.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:40.429
           Let's walk.
           Yes ma'am.

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:44.232
    It's a lovely house, Jim.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:45.233
        It is, isn't it?

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:46.902
I remember it when I was a girl.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:50.305
 I remember a lot of things too.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:55.977
       Now Jim, the past
      is a long time gone.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:59.414
        You have done so
       magnificently well.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:01.883
      I'd like to think Dr.
     Wales and I were partly

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:05.387
 responsible for giving you the
  push in the right direction.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.322
        I'd say it was a
       pretty good shove.

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.759
  Now you know bitterness will

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:13.061
       suck the pleasure
      right out of things.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:17.666
          How's Mazie?

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:18.466
 I don't know how much you know.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:22.304
       It hasn't been all
       sunshine for Mazie.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.740
     I'm sorry to hear that.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.375
  I figured y'all had it made.

01:02:27.377 --> 01:02:31.213
    Pluto, I mean Clayton, he
   comes from such good stock.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.420
        Mrs. Wales, can I
        get you a drink?

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.790
  A scotch would be wonderful.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:43.925
      One scotch coming up.

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:47.229
    It is so good to see you,
    I'm so glad you're here.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:50.065
         Thank you, Jim.

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:53.869
           [Ort] Jim.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:56.371
      You old boll-weevil.
           [Jim] Ort.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:03:00.976
    Come here, you oughta be
   mighty proud, son 'a bitch.

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:03.011
         Save that kinda
       talk for the field.

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.780
I just come to congratulate you.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.548
    I know you did, you look
    great, I love this tie.

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:07.883
              Jim.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.151
          Here she is.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:13.922
        Has she changed?

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:16.191
        Just look at her.
           Mom, stop.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:18.927
     You sound like you're
 exhibited a registered heifer.

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.396
   It's good to see you, Jim.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.032
              Wow.

01:03:24.835 --> 01:03:26.067
 Little old Mazie Wales grew up

01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:29.104
    to be even more stunning
        than I remember.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.139
       You didn't turn out
        so bad yourself.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.009
     [Pluto] Where the hell
    did everyone get off to?

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:35.277
            Stabber,

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:37.512
        goddamn Stabber.

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.114
             Pluto.

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:42.884
   Me and this man, we had us
   some times didn't we Jim?

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:49.291
         I've had myself
       some bad luck, Jim.

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:53.295
   Hey, we gots to go and talk
     somewhere, huh brother?

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:56.898
    Let's all go get a drink.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.137
        Pluto, you still
       drinking, whiskey?

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.206
     [Pluto] I'm never not.

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:27.395
    [Mazie] I should've sent
    you a plant or something.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:29.598
      But I do have another
     little present for you.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:32.467
      I've been saving it.

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:36.271
   Don't open 'til Christmas.

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:38.206
        That Christmas is
        ancient history.

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:44.012
   I am so happy for you, Jim
    and I know that you have

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:46.882
    a wonderful wife now and
    I can't wait to meet her

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:49.618
   and do everything I can to
  make sure she likes it here.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.657
     You might as well start
      now, here she comes.

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.359
 Honey, come here for a minute.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.295
       I want you to meet
         a very special

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.897
friend of mine, this is Mazie...

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.450
             LeMane!

01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:07.668
     Hi Mazie, Lee McNeely,
     it's nice to meet you.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:09.471
It so nice to meet you too, Lee.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.306
     Welcome to Fort Worth.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:12.674
           Thank you.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:15.443
       Sorry to interrupt,
     there are two gentlemen

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.946
    who seem to have settled
       into an all night

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:21.483
   drinking game into what I
   presume to be our bedroom.

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:23.151
     Do you think they would
       mind terribly if I

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:26.288
      put on my pajamas and
    slipped quietly into bed?

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.089
         (Mazie laughs)

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.624
        She's funny too.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:31.159
           I like her.

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:33.094
  I'll take care of it, honey.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:36.097
   Jim, I think it's time you
    kicked us all out and I

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.500
 will get to know this wonderful
   wife of yours soon enough.

01:05:38.502 --> 01:05:40.001
    That's very nice of you.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.103
       I'll lead you out.

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:44.205
        [Jim] All right.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:46.441
 I'll be out there in a minute.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:47.642
       Good show, old man.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:50.011
      [Jim] Good to see ya.

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:02.057
     (festive trumpet music)

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.291
       [Lee] Two diamonds.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.360
 You gotta beat three, sweetie.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:06.695
      This country bumpkin
        here is used to

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:09.531
   throwin' dice with cowboys,
       not playing bridge.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:11.166
            Cowboys?

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:14.002
      Well that sounds fun.
            (laughs)

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.238
    [Woman] You kill me, Lee.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:24.713
          I admire you.

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:27.182
               Me?

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:28.249
          Why on earth?

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.753
      Havin' the courage to
    leave your first husband.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:35.190
   I mean weren't you worried
     about people talking?

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:39.327
   We didn't stick around to
 find out what people would say

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:42.063
 or do, it all happened so fast.

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:43.398
[Mazie] way you describe feeling

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.267
      back then, that's the
      way I feel right now.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:47.769
               Oh.

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:51.172
      Mazie, it was so much
        different for me.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.174
   Look at all that you have.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.744
 You live in a city, the people.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.679
     Pluto, I mean Clayton,

01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:01.583
     he is such a fine young
     man from a good family.

01:07:01.585 --> 01:07:03.485
    Look at this pity party.

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:08.289
    Shake it off, that's what
    I do and drink of course.

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:15.263
           Thank you.

01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:30.378
         It's strange to
        be served dinner.

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:36.084
         [Jim] Well get
       used to it, sugar.

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:39.320
     I don't know what to do
     in this big house, Jim.

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:40.722
 Can I come work in the office?

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.323
    How's your new accountant
    doing, does he need help?

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:46.361
        No, my wife's not
    working at a damn office.

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:49.731
    Besides, I thought you'd
  like to be a lady of leisure.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:52.567
      Leisure and boredom
    seem to go hand in hand.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:56.471
     Leisure and business,
   that's how deals are made.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:08:00.642
      Speaking of, Pluto's
     going to drop by later

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:04.212
   for a drink, says he's got
  an ace of a deal to show me.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:06.548
    I thought we could have
    some time alone tonight.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:07.682
            For once.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:09.684
      He's my old oil field
        buddy, you know?

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:13.088
  You get mighty close working
    on those gangs together.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.524
        Oh, and Mazie's
       tagging along too.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:20.528
               Oh?

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.698
  I have to say, I didn't know
    how I feel about Mazie.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:28.236
       But I do like her,
       she's down to earth

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:30.305
beneath all those fancy clothes.

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:32.372
  She's a good girl, harmless.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:36.144
        I'm glad you two
       are getting along.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:37.679
     (festive trumpet music)

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.346
          I win again.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:42.149
     Hey Lee, why don't you
     come over here and give

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:44.419
      a girl a hand taking
    down these knuckleheads?

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:50.125
     I gotta say it, I hate
   cards and I'm going to bed.

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:53.161
    Don't be so sour, sugar.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:56.531
       I'm not being sour,
         I'm just tired.

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:57.465
              Hey.

01:08:58.435 --> 01:08:59.367
              Hey.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:02.537
  I can send them home, honey.

01:09:03.874 --> 01:09:05.206
              Nah.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:07.207
        Y'all are having
      fun, I am being sour.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.376
      You enjoy yourselves.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:11.212
        Goodnight y'all.
    [Pluto] Goodnight, honey.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:12.881
        [Jim] Goodnight.
       All right Stabber,

01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:17.385
      come and deal 'em up
     you goddamn field hand.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.270
      Let's beat this girl.

01:09:19.272 --> 01:09:21.156
           Oh please.
     [Pluto] She's cheating.

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:24.792
       (telephone ringing)

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.295
             Hello.
      [Jim] Hey sweetheart.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:30.598
  Pack your bags, we're going
 to West Texas for the weekend.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.836
  West Texas, where, just you
  and me, what should I bring?

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:37.337
       [Jim] Oh hell, just
       bring a toothbrush.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:39.307
    Do some cowgirl shopping
       over at Lettie's.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.475
     I'll pick you up at 11.
        - Are you crazy?

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:43.444
       That's in an hour.
        [Jim] Yeah well,

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:45.747
        we'll arrive just
       in time for dinner.

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:46.613
              Jim!

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:49.917
     (country violin music)

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.196
        Upgrade us to the
       Presidential Suite.

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:02.697
        I mean if you're
       gonna do it right,

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.332
         you gotta do it
       right, right sugar?

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:05.667
        Sounds wonderful.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.602
        [Pluto] Stabber.

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.938
     [Mazie] What took y'all
      so long to get here?

01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:13.341
            Hey Lee.
     I should've warned you.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.310
         [Mazie] Hi Jim.
           [Lee] Jim,

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:17.445
    this is a business trip?

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:19.681
 Honey, it's an everything trip.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.551
  Let's go check out our suite.

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:32.293
         (gunshot booms)

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:38.733
 [Jim] Gentlemen, we've drilled
    nine prospects together.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:41.002
  Five were dry, four produced.

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:44.005
        The one in Reagan
      County is just so-so.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:46.007
      I wouldn't recommend
    drilling any more there.

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:48.743
    We'll just, we'll farm it
    out to another operator.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.546
         What we should
       all be thinking is

01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:53.348
   looking for something with
   a little more juice in it.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:54.482
  How long you think it's gonna

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:56.017
      take for that Reagan
        well to pay out?

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:58.953
  At current production rates,
  about three and a half years.

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:00.855
       Oh, well that don't
         sound too bad.

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:03.958
   Why can't we just drill the
  rest of that lease ourselves?

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.760
 The Reagan well's cuttin' water

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.963
      and history's taught
     me when you get water,

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.865
        that water's just
         gonna increase.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:14.802
    I don't make money if you
     boys don't make money.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:18.539
   Our oil in the ground today
   will produce hefty returns.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.942
      Hell, we might even
    find another East Texas.

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.410
        Or Scurry County.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.415
         I'm gonna drill
      these wells on my own

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.484
    or with other partners if
     y'all ain't interested.

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:32.754
  Hold on a minute Jim, nobody
  said we weren't interested.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.022
              Good.

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:37.292
     After this next string
       of wildcats, we'll

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:41.496
 take that safari trip courtesy
   of McNeely Oil of course.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:42.697
           All right.

01:11:42.699 --> 01:11:44.032
       I don't know if you
       gentlemen know this

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:45.833
      but one of my life's
        great ambitions

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.935
        is to kill every
      species that exists.

01:11:47.937 --> 01:11:49.570
 I got about 100 of 'em so far.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.508
    Let me know when you get
    around to homo sapiens,

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:56.377
         so I can hide.
         (men chuckle)

01:11:56.379 --> 01:11:57.812
     My wife's a comedienne.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:01.716
    Oh Jim, I have been dying
      to kill an elephant.

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:04.819
       Honey, I'll fix it
        so that you kill

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.488
        the biggest damn
       elephant in Africa.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.757
    You could mount his foot
     for an umbrella stand,

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.326
    paint his toenails gold.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:14.662
     Dent, line up a safari.

01:12:16.066 --> 01:12:18.933
   You should come too, we'll
  need somebody to mix drinks.

01:12:21.037 --> 01:12:21.969
           Yes B'wana.

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:28.576
   [Jim] Well boys, this next
  string's gonna be real nice.

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:33.581
   Don't worry too much about
   this circus, little buddy.

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.683
       There are very few
    people in this jolly new

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:39.053
  milieu of ours who live lives
    of any real significance.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:41.889
  All our new playmates seem to

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:44.359
     dedicate their lives to
     pleasuring themselves.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.362
       Sybarites, stay up
        late, drink deep

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:49.364
       from the laughing
      waters and burn your

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:51.899
       incense at sunset
       to the God of Fun.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:54.068
          Count me out.

01:12:55.638 --> 01:12:58.840
     (tepid ensemble music)

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:03.111
     The cabbie's loaded up.

01:13:04.147 --> 01:13:06.147
        I'm too close to
      home to not go see it

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.150
 and by golly, close that deal.

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:10.084
          I always do.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:14.389
      I got a good feeling
    about this next prospect.

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:15.890
It might be enough to retire on.

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.860
     Wouldn't that be nice?

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:21.763
      Someday we will, hon.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.498
              Hey.

01:13:27.637 --> 01:13:28.536
             I know.

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:34.675
       Drive safe sugar,
     I'll see you tomorrow.

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:35.710
          Tell dad hi.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:02.203
     This old knee's givin'
      me a little trouble.

01:14:02.205 --> 01:14:06.007
   But nothing an ice pack and
    a shot of rye can't fix.

01:14:08.812 --> 01:14:10.445
     Enough about my health.

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:13.648
            Spill it.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:15.750
          What's wrong?

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:17.952
  You didn't drive all the way

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.687
out here just to make me dinner.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:22.457
It's an empty life we're living.

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:27.028
    All these men he used to
   know now swarming around us

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:29.931
         just because he
       struck a few wells.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.100
     But he's trying to be a
     part of something that

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:38.072
    I just don't care about.
    - Oil men want respect.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.575
         It's a disease.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:45.646
       It makes most crazy
       and others crooked.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:48.082
    Breaks the hearts of the
    strong and rewards a few

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:53.154
   lucky ones with wealth and
  power beyond their deserving.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:55.656
       Jim thinks he lost
       his luck at Scurry.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:58.993
          Maybe he did.

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.696
Help him find his luck, darling.

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:07.602
   Do that and you'll both be
   necessary to one another.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:13.274
  (tepid piano, trumpet music)

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:29.156
       (singing in French)

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.211
           [Mazie] Oh.

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.145
              Jim.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.248
            (moaning)

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.624
         (Mazie screams)

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:20.107
            Nothing?

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:21.809
        What the hell do
      you mean by nothing?

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:23.210
   She doesn't want anything.

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:26.681
    Not the house, no money.

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:27.949
        Just the divorce.

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:30.284
        She's got a legal
      right to what's hers.

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:32.153
      She said she can work

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:37.091
     and you'll need all the
  money you have and then some.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.125
              What?

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:39.894
  What the hell does that mean?

01:16:39.896 --> 01:16:42.296
        Listen, you find
       out what I'm worth

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:44.231
      and she'll damn sure
       take half of that.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:46.267
    You go back and lay that
     on the line right now.

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:47.702
        Why don't you go?

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:50.004
  I sent word I wanted to meet.

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.606
 What else am I supposed to do?

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:54.141
  In the spot you're in buddy,
   you don't send emissaries.

01:16:54.143 --> 01:16:55.343
You get over there, you get down

01:16:55.345 --> 01:16:58.012
       on your knees and
      beg for forgiveness.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:00.047
      Unless of course you
       want this divorce.

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:13.094
       (soft violin tones)

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:32.413
           (knocking)

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.985
        [Lee] Who is it?

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.086
       [Jim] It's me, Lee.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:49.964
        What do you want?

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:51.098
      [Jim] I want to talk.

01:17:53.403 --> 01:17:55.102
  What do you wanna talk about?

01:17:56.873 --> 01:17:59.006
     I didn't mean to hurt
     you, it just happened.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:01.909
    It's just stupid drunken
     behavior, that's all.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.146
        You've loved her
       since she left you.

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:06.714
               No.

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:07.765
               No.

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:08.815
 [Lee] This is exactly what you

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:10.184
         wanted and you
       damn well know it.

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:13.821
    Just get outta here so we
     can get this over with.

01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:19.193
   I've suffered long enough,
      you son of a bitch.

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:23.898
      (somber violin music)

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:31.939
It's over now, I'm done with it.

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:37.044
       Please, I love you.
         [Lee] Go away.

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:39.180
         Leave me alone.

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:42.016
 I never want to see you again.

01:19:23.226 --> 01:19:26.427
      (somber violin music)

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:38.038
        (Mazie laughing)

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:53.420
      (mechanical creaking)

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.026
           Goddammit.

01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:04.498
    Shut this son of a bitch
  down right now, we're empty.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.333
   This is my eighth dry well

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.369
         in a row and it
       better be the last.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:11.405
  Shit Jim, you say that like
 I'm a rock-sniffin' geologist.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:14.508
  I ain't nothin' but a two-bit
   pie-playing son of a bitch.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.879
 I told you all not to eat that
  bone-in chicken on the rig.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:21.849
            Bad luck.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:24.385
            Bad luck.

01:20:24.387 --> 01:20:27.521
      (somber violin music)

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:31.258
      [Jim] You didn't wish
      me a happy birthday.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.893
      Happy birthday, Jim.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:36.864
             Happy.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:42.870
     It's a stupid word, it
     doesn't mean anything.

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:47.241
[Jim] You measure it by success.
  - Successful birthday then.

01:20:47.243 --> 01:20:49.844
A man who owes $3 million and is

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:52.213
only 36 has gotta be successful.

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:54.949
      I wouldn't ride that
        theory too long.

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:57.151
      So what if we hadn't
    found another East Texas,

01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:59.153
 we got reserves in the ground.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:02.556
 And our investors are starting
    to doubt those reserves.

01:21:02.558 --> 01:21:05.526
       Look, I like risks
     just as much as you do

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:07.261
      but sometimes I wish
     you'd let some of these

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:09.597
      deals pay out before
      we get in any deeper.

01:21:09.599 --> 01:21:11.999
     Stop being so neurotic.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:14.034
  We'll hit a sweet spot soon.

01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:16.570
    I'm just being realistic

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:20.074
        and I wish you'd
       take off that tire.

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:21.275
  It makes me feel like I'm one

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:23.410
         heartbeat away
       from unemployment.

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:27.014
   Ah hell Denty boy, I've had
   too much fun puttin' it on.

01:21:27.016 --> 01:21:30.017
     Besides, I got a heart

01:21:30.019 --> 01:21:32.353
      that's stronger than
      bull rhinoceros hide.

01:21:35.358 --> 01:21:38.025
      You know it's Lee's
   birthday in a couple days.

01:21:38.027 --> 01:21:40.361
     Send her some flowers,
   see if she needs anything.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.629
     Already taken care of.

01:21:45.034 --> 01:21:47.401
       Now there's a gift
        worth the wait.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:49.370
Isn't it lovely to be married to

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:52.306
        a man who buys me
    presents on his birthday?

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:55.476
    Are you boys ready to go?

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.378
           I'm ready.

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.547
   [Mazie] I love my bracelet.

01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:05.219
     (anxious violin tones)

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:10.991
  The Bison stock's done well.

01:22:12.194 --> 01:22:15.029
      It sounds like you've
      got a nice nest egg.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:17.631
  They don't care a damn about

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:20.434
a geologist who put in 20 years.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:23.037
   I'll be scratchin' by just
     to make my retirement.

01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:26.540
       Somebody somewhere
     must owe you something.

01:22:29.345 --> 01:22:31.478
        I'm standing here
        with my hand out,

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.113
  waiting for the mana to drop.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:35.950
   I got news for you, buddy.

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:37.685
        Mana don't drop.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:41.088
You gotta reach up and pluck it.

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:44.291
     I don't know how, Jim.

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:46.226
       Never been able to.

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:51.398
      This whole country's
    riddles with damn holes.

01:22:53.502 --> 01:22:55.602
Every time they drill a new one,

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:57.404
  that's one less place to try.

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:00.975
  I'm tired of drilling blind.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.578
     I got the rigs, I know
     where to get the money

01:23:06.048 --> 01:23:08.515
   and I can drill better than
  anyone in this goddamn state.

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:10.451
             But...

01:23:11.287 --> 01:23:12.686
  I gotta know where to drill.

01:23:17.193 --> 01:23:18.325
        You tell me where

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:23.230
    and you will never draw
   another poor breath again.

01:23:24.734 --> 01:23:26.734
      Am I being too subtle
         for you, Barry?

01:23:26.736 --> 01:23:27.668
               No.

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:31.005
  You're not being subtle, Jim.

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:34.241
     It sounds like you're
     talkin' about larceny.

01:23:37.713 --> 01:23:40.447
    [Jim] It's just a little
     map with a dot on it.

01:23:43.252 --> 01:23:47.187
  (anxious violin, piano music)

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:58.098
         (Lee laughing)

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:00.634
       Baby, are you okay?

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:04.071
          Never better.

01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:05.439
       I was beginning to
      look like a ragdoll,

01:24:05.441 --> 01:24:08.308
    so I had to go shopping.

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:11.345
 The Neiman's card was declined
    but I just paid in cash.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:13.814
 Buy whatever the hell you need.

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:16.517
              Jim.

01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:22.656
    This house is a far cry
  from Bowie Street, ain't it?

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.626
     Jim, what's wrong baby?

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:32.433
  (somber violin, piano music)

01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:51.618
     Good morning, sunshine.
      This won't wash, Jim.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.587
       Leave Barry Wakely
      out of your schemes.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.089
       You can do whatever
        the hell you want

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:57.291
         with Bison but
       leave Barry alone.

01:24:58.394 --> 01:25:00.394
       It's funny how it
       comes full circle.

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:02.763
      You feeling sorry for
       poor old Bison Oil

01:25:02.765 --> 01:25:04.665
     Company that's got more
     money than Uncle Sugar.

01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:06.166
 You can't wreck a man like that

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:08.569
     and get away with it,
     it will wreck you too.

01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:10.137
   I see you got your preacher
            suit on,

01:25:10.139 --> 01:25:11.305
          today, ready
        to give me hell.

01:25:11.307 --> 01:25:14.174
       Well Barry has got
      a retarded son who's

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:17.177
   gonna wreck his life is he
  doesn't get money somewhere.

01:25:18.214 --> 01:25:19.379
        You know you've
       gotten mighty damn

01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:22.349
       spoiled workin' for
        me livin' it up.

01:25:22.351 --> 01:25:25.519
      You're a real exotic
        little gentleman

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:27.354
  with mighty expensive tastes.

01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:29.857
  But if this outfit goes bust,

01:25:29.859 --> 01:25:33.160
     you're gonna be out on
   your ass starvin' to death.

01:25:33.162 --> 01:25:36.163
      So quit actin' like a
     goddamn neurotic woman.

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:37.831
        I'm trying to run
        an oil business.

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:40.567
       Jim, you can still
     undo what you started.

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:43.203
     We can go back to West
     Texas and run our rigs.

01:25:43.205 --> 01:25:44.738
        So what if we've
        crapped out here?

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.141
   At least we can look in the
   mirror without throwing up.

01:25:47.143 --> 01:25:48.308
         Get outta here.

01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:50.310
        Hey, don't make a
        crook outta him.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:53.180
 You can be a crook because you
  don't believe it's crooked.

01:25:56.218 --> 01:25:59.419
      Did you ever stop to
   think you're a sucker fish

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:04.324
  who's been living off a mean,
   mean shark all these years?

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.193
 This is Dent you're talking to.

01:26:06.195 --> 01:26:09.596
          Yes Dent, my
      pervert philosopher.

01:26:09.598 --> 01:26:12.933
    As far as I'm concerned,
    you're a useless queer.

01:26:15.171 --> 01:26:15.936
       Get outta my sight.

01:26:17.273 --> 01:26:19.940
      Get outta my life, I
      got a well to drill.

01:26:26.482 --> 01:26:28.215
  I've had to live with myself

01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:31.518
     the best way I could,
    but I never hurt anybody

01:26:32.588 --> 01:26:35.289
       so far as I know or
        corrupted anybody

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:38.192
     with my own corruption.

01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:41.662
    (soft somber piano tones)

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:54.608
          ¶ How many ¶

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:56.743
            ¶ Times ¶

01:26:56.745 --> 01:27:01.815
 ¶ Have you heard someone say ¶

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:06.887
     ¶ If I had his money ¶

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:11.558
  ¶ I could do things my way ¶

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:16.430
  ¶ But little did they know ¶

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:20.934
  ¶ That it's so hard to find ¶

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:25.672
     ¶ One rich man in 10 ¶

01:27:25.674 --> 01:27:30.811
    ¶ With a satisfied mind ¶

01:27:30.813 --> 01:27:34.948
     ¶ Once I was winning ¶

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:39.553

        ¶ Everything that

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:43.857
         [Scottie] Jim!

01:27:45.661 --> 01:27:46.593
              Shit.

01:27:50.266 --> 01:27:52.633
  Everything is about to blow.
         Let's hope so.

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.836
       Your investors and
       the New York Bank

01:27:55.838 --> 01:27:58.472
   both want certified audits,
      they're serious Jim.

01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:00.707
       The hell with them,
     I'm drilling a hellcat.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:05.846
   They want you to shut down
   and not spend another dime.

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:08.015
         Are they outta
      their fuckin' minds?

01:28:08.017 --> 01:28:11.685
  I'm drilling a well right now
  that will pay off everybody.

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:13.987
       They will force you
        into bankruptcy.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.790
       Well how long can
       you hold them off?

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.725
       Jim, I'm a lawyer.

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:21.361
         Not a shyster.
         - Jesus Christ!

01:28:21.363 --> 01:28:23.764
       When did everybody
      get so goddamn moral?

01:28:23.766 --> 01:28:27.968
     You lawyers will steal
    and lie for a rich client

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.770
 but you run like chickens when

01:28:29.772 --> 01:28:32.472
       it's a poor bastard
         who's in a jam.

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:35.609
     You no longer represent
     me, that's all Scottie.

01:28:35.611 --> 01:28:38.011
          (well booms)

01:28:40.749 --> 01:28:44.084
       (muffled shouting)

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:45.752
    What the hell's going on?

01:28:45.754 --> 01:28:47.054
     It's just a kink, boss.

01:28:47.056 --> 01:28:50.724
      [Jim] Then get back
      to drilling, dammit.

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:55.996
 Jim has been so damn irritable.

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.031
       I warned him if he
      kept deserting me for

01:28:58.033 --> 01:29:00.767
       a pile of clanking
   machinery that I was gonna

01:29:00.769 --> 01:29:04.104
   replace him with something
     a little more animate.

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:09.843
       I have to be honest
        with you, Mazie.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.913
   You're coming to the end of

01:29:12.915 --> 01:29:14.481
       the line with your
       pudgy old magnate.

01:29:15.951 --> 01:29:17.451
   He's in trouble, your Jim.

01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:27.494
  It's a funny thing, isn't it?

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:29.563
    What's that, sweetheart?

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:34.668
             I guess

01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:35.702
           eventually,

01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:37.838
         we all wash up.

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:39.873
              You?

01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:42.409
               Oh.

01:29:42.411 --> 01:29:44.010
        I would never say
         that about you.

01:29:45.514 --> 01:29:46.446
           No, not me.

01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:48.982
      Not if I can help it.

01:29:55.758 --> 01:29:57.691
             (slap)

01:29:57.693 --> 01:29:58.692
             I'm...

01:29:58.694 --> 01:29:59.626
              so...

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:19.579
     [Jim] Be better today.
           - Yes sir.

01:30:20.816 --> 01:30:24.951
     Need some tall guys do.
  - We need new daylight water.

01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:31.458
           (knocking)

01:30:34.563 --> 01:30:35.495
              What?

01:30:39.902 --> 01:30:41.168
    [Michael] James McNeely?

01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:44.104
        Who want to know?

01:30:44.106 --> 01:30:45.839
      [Michael] My name's
        Michael Arthur,

01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:47.908
Division Attorney for Bison Oil.

01:30:48.544 --> 01:30:52.045
 You sir are drilling on a lease
   that doesn't belong to you.

01:30:52.047 --> 01:30:53.547
 You acquired this lease through

01:30:53.549 --> 01:30:56.817
      the defalcation of a
     trusted Bison employee,

01:30:56.819 --> 01:30:58.952
       a geologist by the
      name of Barry Wakely.

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:02.823
  Those leases belong to Bison.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:07.894
        In order to save
     embarrassing yourself,

01:31:07.896 --> 01:31:09.729
my company is willing to pay any

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:11.231
       out of pocket costs
         you've incurred

01:31:11.233 --> 01:31:14.468
    provided you sign those
    leases right back to us.

01:31:15.604 --> 01:31:16.837
No charges will be filed against

01:31:16.839 --> 01:31:18.738
 you or Mr. Wakely if you do so.

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:22.576
      Did Barry Wakely tell
     you this bedtime story?

01:31:23.679 --> 01:31:24.744
       Wakely disappeared

01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:30.550
       and that is a clear
       admission of guilt.

01:31:30.552 --> 01:31:32.118
        We know he's been
        meeting with you.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.687
              Yeah?

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:35.088
              Yeah?

01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:36.022
              Yes.

01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:41.995
     I've known him for over
      15 years, on and off.

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:45.899
     He's a friend of mine.

01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:48.969
   We worked together at Bison

01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:51.838
    partnering while you were
     still making mud pies.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.608
        I know all about
      your record at Bison

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:56.710
         and I know I'm
       dealing with a pro.

01:31:57.813 --> 01:32:00.614
       But Bison has been
      unscrupulously looted

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:03.216
        and we'll spare
       no time or expense

01:32:03.218 --> 01:32:05.151
       getting back what's
        rightfully ours.

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:13.193
    Mister lawyer, you folks
      are way outta line.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:16.730
 So you just draw up your papers

01:32:17.799 --> 01:32:19.533
      and sue me, hotshot.

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.270
We'll see you in the courthouse.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.940
       If she's dry, I'll
        buy you a drink

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:30.310
       'cause nobody will
       give a shit but me.

01:32:30.312 --> 01:32:34.881
     If she comes roaring in
     like a wildcat oughta,

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:38.618
      well then we'll have
  something worth suing about.

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:44.958
      [Jim] I hope we both
        have work to do.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:51.298
     (anxious guitar tones)

01:32:56.004 --> 01:32:57.070
           [Ort] Jim!

01:32:58.974 --> 01:32:59.839
              What?

01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:00.774
        I'm running late.

01:33:00.776 --> 01:33:04.811
      It's the crew, we's
     two weeks late on pay.

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:08.682
     [Jim] I got it covered,
       just keep drilling.

01:33:32.641 --> 01:33:36.876
     Mr. McNeely, how about
 upgrading your Corvette today?

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:39.079
       Shit Red, how about
        buying her back?

01:33:39.081 --> 01:33:42.382
    Never did like the color
   my wife picked out anyhow.

01:33:42.384 --> 01:33:43.850
     But it's gotta be cash.

01:33:43.852 --> 01:33:45.285
    Cash will cost you, Jim.

01:33:46.688 --> 01:33:48.221
       But I'm sure we can
       work something out.

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:49.956
      Put it here, partner.
             Great.

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.159
 [Red] Come on let's go in here,

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.361
   I'll buy you a drink boy.
 [Jim] I can use a couple, Red.

01:33:56.098 --> 01:33:59.366
     (relaxed guitar tones)

01:34:00.702 --> 01:34:01.635
              Dent?

01:34:02.938 --> 01:34:06.106
     Dent Paxton, where have
    you been you naughty boy?

01:34:10.846 --> 01:34:12.379
        Mexico's changed.

01:34:13.248 --> 01:34:15.348
 The colors have faded and gone.

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:20.220
         I can't imagine
       that, how could it?

01:34:20.222 --> 01:34:24.057
It's true, they were vivid once.

01:34:24.059 --> 01:34:25.859
   Now they've all gone white.

01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:32.232
    So I came back home, home
     is where the heart is.

01:34:32.234 --> 01:34:33.433
      Isn't that touching?

01:34:36.038 --> 01:34:38.205
          I made it up.

01:34:38.206 --> 01:34:40.373
     Dent, whatever it is,
     it won't last forever.

01:34:41.977 --> 01:34:43.443
     Life is strange is all.

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:48.014
    You only need to breathe
    and to love to enjoy it.

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:52.318
  But we make it so complicated
  for no understandable reason.

01:34:55.323 --> 01:34:57.157
              Why?

01:34:57.159 --> 01:35:00.460
     (anxious violin music)

01:35:55.951 --> 01:35:57.016
           Goddammit.

01:35:58.286 --> 01:36:01.488
      (somber violin music)

01:37:07.255 --> 01:37:09.923
   Munson, can I get a goddamn
     drink in here or what?

01:37:10.859 --> 01:37:11.591
          Mr. McNeely,

01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:15.595
     I seen Mr. Paxton here
     just a few minutes ago.

01:37:16.865 --> 01:37:18.431
        I thought he was
      going for fresh air.

01:37:27.375 --> 01:37:29.075
  Where did he go, Mr. Munson?

01:37:31.146 --> 01:37:34.347
      (somber violin music)

01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:51.464
        (sirens blaring)

01:38:41.683 --> 01:38:43.683
      Best man I ever knew.

01:38:45.153 --> 01:38:46.085
              Yeah.

01:38:49.624 --> 01:38:51.691
    Too good for this world.

01:38:54.930 --> 01:38:57.363
     We hit 12,000 feet but
    we need to pull the bit.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.333
   We only got 400 feet to go,

01:39:00.335 --> 01:39:02.502
       can't you just keep
       turning her right?

01:39:04.005 --> 01:39:05.405
       It'll run the cone
        off if we don't

01:39:05.407 --> 01:39:07.407
         pull the bit up
        out of that hole.

01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:09.275
      Goddammit, just snake
      that pipe out of that

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:11.511
      hole and put the new
     drill bit on right now.

01:39:13.014 --> 01:39:14.080
           Do it, Ort.

01:39:17.352 --> 01:39:18.952
         All right, Jim.

01:39:26.127 --> 01:39:27.126
              Fuck.

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:30.396
     (anxious guitar music)

01:39:49.284 --> 01:39:51.985
    [Ort] Take the drill, you
     see that bit in there?

01:39:51.987 --> 01:39:53.152
        [Worker] Yes sir.
        - All right well

01:39:53.154 --> 01:39:56.022
       pitch it out, pull
    that son of a bitch off.

01:39:56.024 --> 01:39:57.390
         [Man] Yes sir.
 [Ort] How long that gonna take?

01:39:57.392 --> 01:40:00.760
      [Man] Couple hours.
 [Ort] Bullshit, let's move it.

01:40:04.466 --> 01:40:07.567
       Get that bit outta
       there before noon.

01:40:07.569 --> 01:40:09.035
         Let's go, boys.

01:40:10.305 --> 01:40:14.107
     Ain't got time here to
    dally, let's go, come on.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:18.644
         Move your ass!

01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:29.088
  [Ort] Shit, gas! Clear, gas!
      Everybody clear out!

01:40:30.425 --> 01:40:34.427
 (anxious violin, guitar tones)

01:41:17.272 --> 01:41:18.404
            Hey Jim.

01:41:19.441 --> 01:41:20.373
              Jim,

01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:22.508
         come on buddy.

01:41:24.479 --> 01:41:26.245
       Jim, you all right?

01:41:27.715 --> 01:41:31.617
  (soft somber ensemble music)

01:41:58.513 --> 01:42:01.314
          (Jim weeping)

01:42:01.316 --> 01:42:02.648
        You okay, buddy?

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:06.619
        [Nurse] He broke
       his arm and several

01:42:06.621 --> 01:42:08.254
       ribs but that's not
        the main trouble.

01:42:08.256 --> 01:42:10.756
       He's had a massive
      coronary thrombosis.

01:42:10.758 --> 01:42:13.793
He's sedated but he's conscious.

01:42:13.795 --> 01:42:16.329
      I'm glad you're here,
      you must be his wife.

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:19.599
              Um...

01:42:20.869 --> 01:42:22.468
              Yes.

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:23.669
     I thought so, he's been

01:42:23.671 --> 01:42:26.172
      saying your name all
       night. Lee, right?

01:42:31.179 --> 01:42:34.380
      (somber violin music)

01:42:58.740 --> 01:42:59.672
              Hey.

01:43:07.749 --> 01:43:08.681
              Say.

01:43:14.622 --> 01:43:17.290
 I had the worst damn nightmare.

01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:20.793
           You left me

01:43:23.464 --> 01:43:25.264
       and I married that
         grubber Mazie.

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:28.467
          It was awful.

01:43:33.741 --> 01:43:35.341
      Dent killed himself.

01:43:41.749 --> 01:43:42.682
           And Ort...

01:43:48.356 --> 01:43:50.823
I can still smell the swamp gas.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.561
      (somber violin music)

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:48.547
             Jimmy.

01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:56.789
     (relaxed violin music)

01:45:00.762 --> 01:45:01.694
               Hi.

01:45:15.043 --> 01:45:17.443
      [Boy] Are you daddy?
            - Yeah.

01:45:18.079 --> 01:45:20.513
      You a little cowboy?

01:45:20.515 --> 01:45:23.049
     [Boy] Did you see that?
     - Yeah, it's a chicken.

01:45:24.052 --> 01:45:25.584
     [Jimmy] It's a chicken.

01:45:29.924 --> 01:45:31.991
      [Lee] Come on, boys.

01:45:31.993 --> 01:45:36.662
        (relaxed country
      guitar, piano music)

01:46:31.486 --> 01:46:35.588
        (relaxed country
        music continues)
