18:20.976 --> 18:22.686
For Christmasland.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.563
- And now --
-[Grunts]

18:24.688 --> 18:27.441
[Groaniflg]

18:27.566 --> 18:30.527
You said I was special.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.029
CHARLIE MANX: You are, Bing.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.616
And the children need you.

18:35.741 --> 18:39.703
You know in your heart
Christmasland is for them.

18:39.828 --> 18:42.873
It's all I wanted.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.458
It's all -- It's all I had!

18:44.583 --> 18:45.459
CHARLIE MANX: N0.

18:45.584 --> 18:48.378
No, you had the mission.

18:48.503 --> 18:52.466
That's what you gave up
your life for, not for me.

18:52.591 --> 18:56.261
These children
are in danger, Bing.

18:56.386 --> 19:00.182
They need us to save them.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.727
We can still save Wayne.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.020
With the Wraith.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.231
Please, Bing.

19:08.357 --> 19:14.071
Let's give him
the happiness that we...

19:14.196 --> 19:16.114
can never have.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.412
No.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.456
You -- You --
You think I'm dumb.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.375
- CHARLIE MANX: No.
- Not special.

No.

[Groaniflg]

19:32.673 --> 19:34.216
YOUNG CHARLIE:
Think of it, Oscar --

19:34.341 --> 19:38.261
surrounded by toys,
sweets, fun...

19:38.387 --> 19:41.014
away from this stinking den
full of wanton women

19:41.139 --> 19:42.808
and faithless men.

19:42.933 --> 19:44.976
My morn is here. So's yours.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.604
Whores were hardly made
to be mothers.

19:47.729 --> 19:51.274
Fanny Manx and Trudy Holiday

19:51.400 --> 19:54.695
Mr. Tim pays able-bodied boys
to work at his store.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.905
You can save up and...

19:57.030 --> 20:00.242
maybe leave this rotten town
one day.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.743
And if you're
good enough a worker,

20:01.868 --> 20:05.789
Mr. Tim may even reward you with
a special trip to his house.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.166
What's there?

20:08.291 --> 20:11.294
Taffy, rock candy, gumdrops,

20:11.420 --> 20:14.131
yo-yos, clockwork toys,
tin soldiers --

20:14.256 --> 20:17.509
more fun
than a boy could imagine.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.556
Zi said Mr. Tim's a creep.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.057
The boys who go
to Mr. Tim's house --

20:24.182 --> 20:28.478
Zion is a jealous liar
and a bad worker.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.439
Not like you, Oscar.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.817
You'll earn every gift
Mr. Tim could give.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.728
Oh, what is that,
you smart little man?

21:09.853 --> 21:11.730
Oh, I'm helping Mr. Tim.

21:11.855 --> 21:15.275
Saving up for the sled
in his front window.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.361
Charlie, has he asked you
over to the store?

21:18.487 --> 21:21.072
My job is to send
the other boys.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.702
I don't want you
going over there.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.953
Alright, Charlie?

21:27.078 --> 21:29.664
But the sled...

21:29.790 --> 21:32.125
When you have enough nickels,
we'll go together.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.585
I promise.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.421
Alright, handsome, alright.
Come on.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.817
[Train whistle blows
in distance]

21:59.945 --> 22:02.531
You are special, Bing.

22:07.202 --> 22:10.997
It's because you're special...

22:11.122 --> 22:13.792
that you can't go
to Christmasland.

22:13.917 --> 22:17.671
Doesn't make any sense.

22:17.796 --> 22:20.757
I'm special, too...

22:20.882 --> 22:24.010
so I know.

22:24.135 --> 22:28.765
That's how I've always known.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.684
Stop it.

22:30.809 --> 22:33.186
Enough with your
sweetie sweet talk.

22:37.274 --> 22:42.821
My mother was
a loathsome whore...

22:45.031 --> 22:48.034
...who provided food...

22:48.159 --> 22:50.579
but starved us of dignity.

22:54.416 --> 22:59.963
There was a man.

23:00.088 --> 23:04.634
He was like a father to me.

23:04.759 --> 23:10.098
He tempted my hungry soul
with praise and work.

23:10.223 --> 23:12.434
[Coughing]

23:16.897 --> 23:18.690
With purpose.

23:24.237 --> 23:27.908
The man, this "father," used me.

23:28.033 --> 23:33.163
Mishandled me like
your father mishandled you.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.916
My mother, like your mother,

23:36.041 --> 23:40.503
did nothing to stop him.

23:40.629 --> 23:42.714
My mother said she loved rne.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.674
Yes.

23:44.799 --> 23:50.347
My mother said the same to me,
for all the good it did.

23:55.268 --> 23:59.522
That's how
we are special, Bing.

24:02.692 --> 24:05.403
We are children unsaved.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.281
Innocence stolen.

24:11.785 --> 24:16.373
What is our place
in Christmasland?

24:18.083 --> 24:20.919
A world of joy
and wonder?

24:23.838 --> 24:26.758
L-l don't know.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.551
We don't have one.

24:33.306 --> 24:36.434
But because it's too late
for us...

24:38.019 --> 24:43.108
...we know how important it is
to save those...

24:45.610 --> 24:47.737
...who still have time.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.037
The moment I got your letter,

24:56.162 --> 25:00.125
I knew you were more than
an assistant, like Peter Ives.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.960
I knew that you would be
my partner.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.058
'Cause we're both special?

Yes.

in our good work.

to hear it, Bing.

who like each other

go to a movie
or a fancy dress party.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.548

28:26.873 --> 28:29.834
It's to never leave.

Well, I'm leaving
the minute I turn 16.

I'm gonna be a great explorer,
just like her.

My husband, Duncan,
will stay home with the kids

28:42.096 --> 28:44.807
while I fly an airplane
or take a steamer ship

28:44.933 --> 28:47.227
to see the Pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

to be out there all alone?

keep us here?

to be like rne.

more than that.

Why would I grow up to be you?

29:52.458 --> 29:55.336

29:55.461 --> 30:00.091
Your father says he gave you
the gift of eternal childhood.

30:00.216 --> 30:01.843
But really he's imprisoned you

30:01.968 --> 30:05.013
and stolen your chance
to be a woman.

30:05.138 --> 30:07.432
Women are selfish and dangerous.

30:07.557 --> 30:08.891

If he's caught lying, cheating,
or killing,

30:12.353 --> 30:13.896
he'll pin the fault
on the closest woman

30:14.022 --> 30:15.398
and hide to escape the blame.

you will, too.

out of here.

find your own way.

to whisk Wayne away?

31:19.295 --> 31:22.548

Soon he will be crying cries.

31:40.149 --> 31:41.984
What?

31:42.110 --> 31:45.571
The Wraith is making him cry.

31:45.696 --> 31:50.284
Well, the process causes
some discomfort,

31:50.410 --> 31:54.163
but -- but you saw --
you saw your friend Michael,

31:54.288 --> 31:56.541
how happy he was in the end.

31:56.666 --> 32:01.462
You lie and you lie and you lie.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.090
I saw what happened to Mike.

32:06.634 --> 32:09.303
You get better...

32:09.429 --> 32:10.680
while they get sick.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.348
I must live to --

32:12.473 --> 32:14.851
to care for the children
and maintain the park.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.562
No, you use them,
like you use me.

32:17.687 --> 32:19.564
In turn, they live forever.

32:19.689 --> 32:23.526
Wayne doesn't want
to live forever.

32:23.651 --> 32:26.487
He just wants his morn.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.489
You know what, Mr. Manx?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.825
You're a bad father.
Like mine.

32:30.950 --> 32:35.121
But I taught Paul Demeter
how to be good dad.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.583
I can teach you, too.

32:42.336 --> 32:45.465
Paul knew just what
to do with his mouth.

32:47.717 --> 32:49.469
You'll learn to say,

32:49.594 --> 32:53.222
"l love you more than anything,
Bing Partridge."

32:53.347 --> 32:54.557
No.

32:54.682 --> 32:55.725
You'll see.

33:26.339 --> 33:31.093
Well, it wasn't a gift.
I earned it.

33:31.219 --> 33:34.972
You are an industrious one,
my beautiful boy.

33:36.933 --> 33:39.977
Everyone seems to be
enjoying a late morning.

33:40.102 --> 33:43.022
Well, it's --
it's a holiday, sir.

33:43.147 --> 33:44.649
I don't suppose
my best assistant

33:44.774 --> 33:46.943
would pour me a whiskey?

[Liquid pouring]

34:10.091 --> 34:12.927
Here's your drink.

34:13.052 --> 34:16.389
You're such a special boy,
Charlie.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.891
Let's play a game.

34:21.643 --> 34:22.895
I-I-I can find Oscar.

34:23.020 --> 34:27.400
Why when my best assistant

34:45.960 --> 34:49.797
What have you done
with the Wraith?

34:49.922 --> 34:52.842
I felt it move.

34:55.052 --> 34:57.013
You need me, Bing.

34:57.138 --> 35:00.558
You are all alone in this world.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.062
The police will send you
back to prison.

35:05.187 --> 35:08.524
I am all you have!

BINGI N0.

35:09.692 --> 35:13.195
I have the Gas Mask Man.

35:13.321 --> 35:15.698
I was just a janitor
in Haverhill,

35:15.823 --> 35:17.366
hiding from my past.

35:19.994 --> 35:23.706
But you -- you freed me.

- No.

35:28.669 --> 35:31.088

35:33.215 --> 35:34.884
Don't, Bing, please!

35:35.009 --> 35:38.888
Bitch, bitch, go to sleep.

35:39.013 --> 35:42.308

If I'm a monster, what are you?

35:53.944 --> 35:55.988
You -- You brought me
those children,

35:56.113 --> 35:59.533
including your dear,
sweet "friend," Michael.

35:59.659 --> 36:02.703
Nobody told you
Paul Demeter was a bad father.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.330
The Graveyard of What Might Be

36:04.455 --> 36:07.249
never showed that Michael
needed to be saved.

36:07.375 --> 36:14.006
You had no great purpose
to rape a man and steal his son.

36:14.131 --> 36:18.260
You used them to get
into Christmasland!

36:18.386 --> 36:20.304
You destroyed families

36:20.429 --> 36:22.848
to satisfy your depraved,
carnal urges.

36:22.973 --> 36:27.436
You are a degenerate,
murderous monster.

36:27.561 --> 36:31.899
You use children, anyone,
to get what you want.

36:32.024 --> 36:35.986
If I deserve death,
Mr. Partridge,

36:36.112 --> 36:41.492
then you deserve
much, much worse.

36:48.958 --> 36:50.084
You're right.

36:55.423 --> 36:57.299
We're both monsters.

No, no, Bing.

- Please.

38:29.183 --> 38:31.685
Did he hurt you?
We'll get you cleaned up.

38:31.811 --> 38:33.145
And then we'll go
find Boss Mitchell.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.355
L-l've got to get away
from here.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.232
No, no.

You knew, too.

38:51.831 --> 38:54.959
You helped him.

38:55.084 --> 38:57.336
Never mind.
It's not important now.

38:57.461 --> 38:59.171
I didn't do anything.

38:59.296 --> 39:00.297
You made me!

39:00.422 --> 39:02.049
Charlie, listen --

39:02.174 --> 39:03.592
You wanted money.

39:03.717 --> 39:07.263
You pranced around, throwing
yourself onto disgusting men

39:07.388 --> 39:08.556
so I would help you.

39:08.681 --> 39:09.932
I did not.

39:10.057 --> 39:13.310
You sickened me until I had
to do something, you whore.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.187
You made me do it!
