Check her.
Check she's okay.

Why did you want me
to see that?

Is that what
this is all about?

I told you,
I don't know.

<i>Heather is going</i>

31:19.647 --> 31:21.683
This is about money?

31:21.816 --> 31:23.150
You can get someone else.

31:23.283 --> 31:25.285
She doesn't deserve
to be mixed up in this.

31:25.419 --> 31:27.254
- What's going on?
- Not now, Zach.

31:27.388 --> 31:29.691

It's a matter
of life and death.

32:22.744 --> 32:24.378
<i>What's happened?</i>

32:24.512 --> 32:26.947
Christina, I don't have
time to explain.

They're fine.
I had to get you on the phone.

Listen to me.
Something's happened.

- Yes. Yes, he's fine.

Do you understand?

Right now, we just
have to do what he says.

And everything will be
fi-fine. Okay.

35:00.267 --> 35:02.870

I need you to go

It's Mom.
What are they waiting for?

01:00:52.587 --> 01:00:54.288
They think I'm the bomber.

01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:56.390
Then tell them you're not.
Tell them about the guy
on the phone.

01:00:56.525 --> 01:00:58.192
I'll try.

01:00:58.325 --> 01:00:59.561
Try? I'll tell them.

It's not there.
It's under our seats.

[loudly]
It's under our seats!

01:02:03.123 --> 01:02:05.726
- We have no time.
- [speaking indistinctly]

01:02:16.837 --> 01:02:19.240

No, we haven't got
the time for this.

Everyone okay?

My daughter's hurt.
She's lost a lot of blood.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:30.110
We need help. Now.

01:03:31.278 --> 01:03:33.347
How you doing,
sweetheart?

01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:36.718
Good girl.

We have EMTs right here.
We'll get her seen to
real soon.

Then bring them in now.

01:03:48.262 --> 01:03:50.264
You've got
everybody's attention, Matt.

01:03:51.365 --> 01:03:54.368
A lot of people here
are worried about you.

01:03:54.502 --> 01:03:55.869
Especially Heather.

01:03:57.104 --> 01:03:58.939
She just wants
to see her family again,

01:03:59.073 --> 01:04:00.542
and I want
to make sure she does.

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:03.911
I'm here to help you.

01:04:06.113 --> 01:04:08.148
I just need to know
you're not gonna,

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:10.685
you know,
do something crazy.

01:04:10.819 --> 01:04:13.487
I mean, you go, I go.

01:04:19.393 --> 01:04:21.995
- And I have a family too.
- [Zach] Hey...

01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:24.998
My Dad didn't do
any of this, okay?

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:26.433
There's this psycho
on the phone

01:04:26.568 --> 01:04:28.969
- talking into his ear.
- [Angela] Zach...

01:04:30.739 --> 01:04:32.306
You see all that?

01:04:33.307 --> 01:04:35.275
I have a lot going on here.

01:04:35.409 --> 01:04:37.978
I'm just gonna
talk to your dad here
for a minute, okay?

01:04:38.112 --> 01:04:40.881
I promise
I'll talk to you too.

01:04:41.014 --> 01:04:44.918
Zach, it's okay.
I... I didn't do this.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:46.387
I wouldn't.

01:04:46.521 --> 01:04:49.256
Matt. Can I call you Matt,
Mr. Turner?

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:50.891
Call me whatever you want.

01:04:51.024 --> 01:04:53.227
Just get us out of this car.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.262
Your children
can get out right now

01:04:55.396 --> 01:04:57.665
if that's all right, Matt.

01:04:57.799 --> 01:04:59.601
The car will explode.

01:05:00.702 --> 01:05:02.970
I see. If they get out,
the car explodes.

01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:15.717
Under our seats,
there are pressure triggers.

01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.452
Well, our friends here
are looking into that,
aren't they?

01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:21.455
You turned off the phones,
yeah?

01:05:31.599 --> 01:05:34.201
We've jammed cell signal
for five blocks.
You should be honored.

01:05:34.334 --> 01:05:35.770
They haven't interrupted

01:05:35.904 --> 01:05:39.339
the telephone service
in Berlin since 1945.

01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:42.610
Nice to unplug for a minute.

01:05:50.618 --> 01:05:52.119
[beeping]

01:05:54.722 --> 01:05:57.559
You say that he
called you on that?

01:05:58.793 --> 01:06:00.461
Do you know who he is?

01:06:00.595 --> 01:06:02.864
If I knew that,
I would tell you.

01:06:02.996 --> 01:06:04.866
Just get them out.

01:06:04.998 --> 01:06:06.668
Look at my daughter, please.

01:06:09.704 --> 01:06:12.105
Okay. [speaks German]

01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:15.710
They think
the doors are clear.

01:06:15.844 --> 01:06:17.211
We'd like to open them.

01:06:22.784 --> 01:06:24.017

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:43.370
[officer grunts]

01:06:45.974 --> 01:06:48.141
So, three colleagues
from your company

01:06:48.275 --> 01:06:50.043
die in one day,
but not you.

01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:53.681
I didn't do this.
I didn't set off
those bombs.

01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:55.382
Okay. Understood.

01:06:56.316 --> 01:06:57.785
[both chuckle]

01:06:58.553 --> 01:07:00.220
It's gonna be okay, okay?

01:07:00.354 --> 01:07:02.089
[Angela] But why would
someone do this to you?

01:07:02.222 --> 01:07:03.725
- I'll have a look
under your seat now.
- Why you, Matt?

01:07:03.858 --> 01:07:05.627
To punish you?

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.595
- [Matt] Money.
- You can get money
robbing a bank...

01:07:07.729 --> 01:07:12.734
- [whirring]
- ...or working
a fancy job like yours.

01:07:12.867 --> 01:07:14.167
Not this kind of money.

01:07:16.103 --> 01:07:17.639
What kind of money?

01:07:23.545 --> 01:07:26.446
Trust, Matt.
I need trust.

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:30.518
You've had a lot of losses
for your clients,

01:07:30.652 --> 01:07:32.085
but you still have
a nice car.

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:34.221
[scoffs] Do I?

01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.292
Well, I guess
you've had a tough day.

01:07:38.425 --> 01:07:40.662
A tough week?
A tough year?

01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:44.732
How much did your clients
lose this year?

01:07:44.866 --> 01:07:47.200
We all lost this year.

01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:51.405
Well, I know that you
and your recent colleagues

01:07:51.539 --> 01:07:53.841
lost a lot of money
for your trusting clients

01:07:53.975 --> 01:07:55.810
who invested in your fund,

01:07:55.944 --> 01:07:58.713
yet you kept
making promises.

01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:02.349
Promises
that profits would appear.

01:08:03.585 --> 01:08:05.352
Maybe he's an angry client.

01:08:05.485 --> 01:08:07.487
"An angry client." Mm.

01:08:07.622 --> 01:08:10.792
What kind of money
did you say he wanted?

01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:12.627
Just hurry up, please.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.828
What kind of money?

01:08:15.195 --> 01:08:17.765
208 million euros.

01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:22.804
All Nanite Capital accounts
have been frozen.

01:08:22.937 --> 01:08:26.506
So, how does he plan
to access this money?

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.343
The account's based
in Dubai.

01:08:29.475 --> 01:08:32.212
It's outside
your jurisdiction.

01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:34.214
Who knows
about this account?

01:08:35.148 --> 01:08:36.884
Partners in the firm.

01:08:37.018 --> 01:08:38.553
How many are still alive?

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:44.124
Just me.

01:08:44.256 --> 01:08:46.060
[officer] It's clear
back here. No device.

01:08:46.193 --> 01:08:47.862
No pressure plates
in the back.

01:08:47.996 --> 01:08:49.796
He said it was
under our seats.

01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:53.901
What are you waiting for?

01:08:54.035 --> 01:08:56.269
[indistinct conversation]

01:09:00.908 --> 01:09:03.343
We're getting your children
out now, but...

01:09:03.477 --> 01:09:04.879
Please, hurry.

01:09:05.013 --> 01:09:06.648
But the bomb under your seat

01:09:06.781 --> 01:09:09.550
is hardwired
to the seat sensors.

01:09:09.684 --> 01:09:11.151
Even if we take out
the car battery,

01:09:11.283 --> 01:09:12.953
shut down the car's CPI,

01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:16.323
you get up, it will
still trigger the bomb.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:17.759
[officer]
Grab my shoulder.

01:09:17.892 --> 01:09:20.728
There you go, Em.
Em, go. It's okay.

01:09:22.063 --> 01:09:24.363
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay, baby.

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:26.801
It's okay. I love you.

01:09:31.304 --> 01:09:32.740
Dad.

01:09:32.874 --> 01:09:35.175
[sighs deeply]

01:09:35.977 --> 01:09:38.513
Dad, I'm not gonna
leave you.

01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:43.283
- Uh, I'll be fine.
- If you stay, I stay.

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:45.586
- Go with your sister.
- Dad...

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.689
You just tell that girlfriend
of yours, um, Mila,

01:09:48.823 --> 01:09:51.893
I hope I can still meet her.
Yeah?

01:09:52.026 --> 01:09:53.359
- I hope so too.
- Yeah.

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.830
I made a promise
I'd get you out.

01:09:57.165 --> 01:09:59.232
I love you, Zach.
Go on.

01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:00.868
Love you too.

01:10:01.002 --> 01:10:02.737
I'm gonna fix this.

01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:06.273
Good boy.

01:10:15.683 --> 01:10:17.552
- [gasps]
- Mom.

01:10:19.352 --> 01:10:20.988
- I'm okay.
- Oh, sweetie.

01:10:29.597 --> 01:10:31.465
Can it be deactivated?

01:10:31.599 --> 01:10:32.967
We're still working on it.

01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:34.736
Can I talk to my wife?

01:10:34.869 --> 01:10:38.005
You will.
When we get you out.

01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:42.110
I need to talk
to her. Please.

01:10:42.242 --> 01:10:44.879
[soft music playing]

01:10:45.012 --> 01:10:46.246
[sighs]

01:10:49.150 --> 01:10:50.450
Okay.

01:10:56.657 --> 01:10:59.392
- Ma'am?
- Oh. Oh.

01:11:00.427 --> 01:11:02.329
Thank you.

01:11:04.198 --> 01:11:05.499
Matt?

01:11:06.366 --> 01:11:08.002
- Honey...
- [sighs]

01:11:08.136 --> 01:11:09.137
Are you okay?

01:11:09.269 --> 01:11:12.240
Uh, I've had better days.

01:11:12.372 --> 01:11:13.708
[chuckles]

01:11:15.977 --> 01:11:18.946
I didn't do this.
I want you to know that.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.583
Matt, just do whatever
the police say.

01:11:22.717 --> 01:11:25.318
<i>Just listen to them</i>
<i>and they'll get you out,</i>
<i>okay?</i>

01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:27.822
You have to do as they say.

01:11:29.056 --> 01:11:30.390
[Heather sobbing]

01:11:32.059 --> 01:11:33.393
<i>Matt?</i>

01:11:33.528 --> 01:11:35.930
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything.

01:11:37.165 --> 01:11:38.966
<i>I-I should've</i>
<i>been there for you.</i>

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.468
- [breathing shakily]
- For all of you.

01:11:41.602 --> 01:11:43.137
[Heather crying]

01:11:43.271 --> 01:11:44.972
Don't say that.

01:11:46.641 --> 01:11:48.776
I love you, baby.

01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:50.077
I always have.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.781
Just come home.

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:58.586
- <i>We'll be okay.</i>
- I will.

01:11:58.719 --> 01:12:00.621
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:12:04.525 --> 01:12:06.060
[ambulance engine starts]

01:12:07.094 --> 01:12:08.629
[ambulance siren wailing]

01:12:15.903 --> 01:12:17.138
[sniffles]

01:12:17.271 --> 01:12:19.507
You're all here
focused on me.

01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:22.543
And he is still out there.

01:12:22.677 --> 01:12:24.444
He's the one
that did this to me.

01:12:24.579 --> 01:12:26.747
You don't have
to worry about that.

01:12:26.881 --> 01:12:28.115
We'll find him.

01:12:30.718 --> 01:12:32.553
You don't believe me.

01:12:33.521 --> 01:12:36.958
What I believe right now
is irrelevant.

01:12:37.091 --> 01:12:38.526
I can find him.

01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:43.030
Matt, you go into custody.
We'll work through this.

01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:46.433
We'll walk through
every possibility.

01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:48.069
You have my word on that.

01:12:50.304 --> 01:12:51.672
No.

01:12:51.806 --> 01:12:53.341
[foreboding music plays]

01:12:53.473 --> 01:12:55.710
He set me up
and you all bought it.

01:12:57.444 --> 01:13:00.014
Right now, we're trying
to get you out of this car.

01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:02.149
That is my only objective.

01:13:02.283 --> 01:13:04.585
[foreboding music continues]

01:13:04.719 --> 01:13:07.021
You have your objective,
and I have mine.

01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:11.292
If you can't find him,
I will.

01:13:11.424 --> 01:13:12.360
Matt...

01:13:12.526 --> 01:13:14.595
Tell them to stand down.

01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:17.665
[foreboding music continues]

01:13:19.233 --> 01:13:20.635
Tell them to stand down.

01:13:20.768 --> 01:13:23.304
Matt, if you leave,
I cannot protect you.

01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:24.639
I want to be clear
about that.

01:13:24.772 --> 01:13:26.274
- [engine starts, revvs]
- Matt! Matt!

01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:28.643

I want my life back.

Face to face.
Or you get nothing.

01:14:29.537 --> 01:14:31.639
<i>I could end this right now.</i>

[brakes screech]

01:14:39.347 --> 01:14:41.816
So, what's it gonna be?

01:14:43.017 --> 01:14:44.018
End it!

01:14:45.586 --> 01:14:47.788
End it! End it!

01:14:49.457 --> 01:14:52.093

<i>Not you.</i>

<i>I said drive.</i>

01:17:11.765 --> 01:17:13.602
Where?

01:17:13.734 --> 01:17:15.836
<i>How about someplace</i>
<i>a little more quiet?</i>

Surprise. [chuckles]

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:44.798
[distorted]
I told you, Matt.

01:17:44.932 --> 01:17:47.234
You're not as smart
as you think.

01:17:47.368 --> 01:17:49.504
[laughs]

01:17:49.638 --> 01:17:52.072
- [sighs]
- Jesus Christ.

01:17:52.206 --> 01:17:55.709
[in normal voice] Well,
not quite water into wine,

01:17:55.843 --> 01:17:59.346
but I did just manage
to turn a few bodies

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.482
into 208 million euros.

01:18:01.616 --> 01:18:03.184
[laughs]

01:18:05.819 --> 01:18:07.188
I...

01:18:08.856 --> 01:18:12.259
I watched you die
in that explosion.

01:18:12.393 --> 01:18:16.764
Misdirection is at the heart
of all great magic tricks.

01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:19.166
I just needed
a little distraction.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.169
Thankfully,
German trains run on time.

01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:27.408
You know, that last blast
had a little more kick

01:18:27.542 --> 01:18:29.310
than I expected.

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:30.945
But with all that money...

01:18:33.781 --> 01:18:36.083
I'll just get myself
a new face.

01:18:37.652 --> 01:18:40.020
You did this all for money?

01:18:40.154 --> 01:18:41.623
Survival.

01:18:41.755 --> 01:18:44.124
Prison's no place
for a man with my taste.

01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:46.026
[sighs]

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.231
I gave you
18 years of my life,

01:18:50.364 --> 01:18:52.701
- you son of a bitch!
- [chuckles]

01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:57.338
This was all inevitable, Matt.
Don't take it personally.

01:18:57.471 --> 01:18:58.939
Inevitable?

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:03.645
If Cinderella's slipper
fit so perfectly,

01:19:03.777 --> 01:19:05.913
then why did it fall off?

01:19:08.583 --> 01:19:09.950
[quietly] Huh?

01:19:11.185 --> 01:19:14.589
Anders, what happened to you?

01:19:14.723 --> 01:19:16.658
You know the business
we're in, Matt.

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:20.461
It's kill or be killed.
Your words.

01:19:21.462 --> 01:19:24.198
Don't go thinking
you're different than me.

01:19:24.331 --> 01:19:26.834
You're the murderer,
not me.

01:19:30.672 --> 01:19:32.072
You really think so?

01:19:34.576 --> 01:19:36.110
Are you sure about that?

01:19:36.243 --> 01:19:39.913
[Matt, on recording]
<i>Anders, authorize liquidation,</i>

01:19:40.047 --> 01:19:41.448
<i>or I will...</i>

<i>Authorize liquidation,</i>
<i>or I will...</i>

01:19:45.119 --> 01:19:46.554
<i>kill you.</i>

01:19:47.988 --> 01:19:50.891
[Anders, on recording]
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

01:19:51.025 --> 01:19:52.960
<i>I'm doing what you want,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

01:19:53.093 --> 01:19:56.030
<i>I'm calling, Matt.</i>
<i>Just... hold on.</i>

01:19:56.163 --> 01:19:58.332
[Matt] <i>Do it.</i>

01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:04.038
[Matt, distorted]
<i>Anders, I will kill you.</i>

01:20:05.439 --> 01:20:07.041
[Anders laughing]

01:20:09.877 --> 01:20:12.946
All sounds
pretty convincing to me.

01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:18.952
The bombs, the money.
It all points to you.

01:20:19.086 --> 01:20:20.254
[Matt sighs]

01:20:20.387 --> 01:20:22.657
You know what was
the easiest thing?

[menacing music plays]

01:20:26.393 --> 01:20:28.929
You know
there's a bomb-making service
on the dark web?

01:20:29.063 --> 01:20:30.765
If you pay them a premium,

01:20:30.898 --> 01:20:33.434
they'll even install it
in the car.

01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:38.272
I'm five steps ahead
of everyone, Matt.

01:20:38.405 --> 01:20:39.574
Make no mistake.

01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:46.013
Now, if you'd be so kind
and complete the transaction.

01:20:46.146 --> 01:20:47.848
Transfer the money, Matt.

01:20:49.249 --> 01:20:54.421
The minute you try to withdraw
one cent of that money,

01:20:54.556 --> 01:20:56.056
they'll know you're alive.

01:20:56.890 --> 01:20:58.626
It's in a crypto account.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.628
Untraceable. Impregnable.

01:21:00.762 --> 01:21:01.995
You really think
I haven't thought

01:21:02.129 --> 01:21:04.599
of every single
possible permutation?

01:21:06.501 --> 01:21:09.504
When your kids
got in the car this morning,

01:21:09.637 --> 01:21:10.938
do you think I panicked?

01:21:11.706 --> 01:21:14.375
The one day that you decide
to be a good daddy

01:21:14.509 --> 01:21:17.645
and drive your kids
to school? No.

01:21:17.779 --> 01:21:20.981
I adapted. I overcame.

01:21:21.115 --> 01:21:22.550
Just like I did
when Pils Kroger

01:21:22.684 --> 01:21:25.085
was going to pull the rug
out from under us.

01:21:25.219 --> 01:21:28.055
He was going to destroy us.

01:21:28.188 --> 01:21:30.090
I wasn't gonna
let that happen.

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:34.428
He found out
you were siphoning money
from the offshore account.

01:21:34.562 --> 01:21:37.498
The FCA doesn't look kindly
on embezzlement.

01:21:37.632 --> 01:21:39.567
He...

01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:42.002
he did nothing to you.

01:21:43.337 --> 01:21:47.107
And what did you do
when you found out? Hmm?

01:21:48.442 --> 01:21:50.512
You did nothing.

01:21:50.645 --> 01:21:54.047
- You looked the other way.
- I didn't know
what you were doing.

01:21:54.181 --> 01:21:55.916
Don't be naive!

01:21:57.217 --> 01:21:58.986
It's always been about
the bottom line for us.

01:21:59.119 --> 01:22:02.256
Bullshit! Everything I did
was above board.

01:22:02.389 --> 01:22:04.726
You really do think
you're different, don't you?

01:22:04.859 --> 01:22:07.762
At least I accept who I am.

01:22:07.896 --> 01:22:10.230
You just lie to yourself
every day.

01:22:10.364 --> 01:22:12.466
You just let it
eat away at you

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.302
until your own family
doesn't recognize you.

01:22:16.403 --> 01:22:18.907
I'm not surprised
Heather wants to leave you.

01:22:19.039 --> 01:22:22.242
I'm just surprised
it took this long to do it.

01:22:22.376 --> 01:22:26.146
Now stop wasting time.
Call the bank!

01:22:28.148 --> 01:22:31.753
I said call the bank.
This is your last chance.

[tense music playing]

01:22:34.087 --> 01:22:36.123

[loudly] Call them!

01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:48.202
There's one thing
you didn't think of, Anders.

01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:55.777

when he's got nothing to lose.

01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.128
Stop!

01:23:15.964 --> 01:23:17.732
- Stop!
- No, no.

01:23:17.866 --> 01:23:19.166
- I said stop!
- No.

01:23:19.299 --> 01:23:21.034
Pull over
or I'll kill us both!

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:23.771
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Heather.
