00:20.270 --> 00:24.441
<i>The defective LH2 valve
which caused the Apollo 23 explosion</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:27.402
<i>has been remanufactured
by a new contractor</i>

00:27.486 --> 00:29.863
<i>and has passed all qual
and acceptance tests.</i>

00:29.947 --> 00:33.408
<i>We're ready to install it
in the second stage of Apollo 24.</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:37.079
<i>But in the process
of de-stacking the rocket,</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:40.874
<i>there was a mishap
in the Vertical Assembly Building</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:43.794
<i>and some damage was done
to the LOX vent lines</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:45.879
<i>and the liquid hydrogen fuel tank.</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:49.424
<i>That stage will have to be
completely rebuilt before it can fly.</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:52.511
<i>So we're replacing it
with the second stage</i>

00:52.594 --> 00:55.138
<i>originally targeted for Apollo 26.</i>

00:56.473 --> 00:59.351
<i>But that will take time.</i>

00:59.977 --> 01:04.565
<i>So I'm afraid that the launch of Apollo 24
will need to be delayed--</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:06.900
-Another two weeks.
-<i>Another two weeks.</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:08.318
BOHICA.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.028
<i>I'm sorry. We didn't get that last.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:13.657
<i>I did.
Just more navy squid gibberish, sir.</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:16.076
-<i>Don't pay it any attention.</i>
-Says the air force puke.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.204
How is the new job, Buzz?

01:19.288 --> 01:21.957
You enjoying flying a desk
around the astronaut office?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.251
<i>Just keeping it warm until Deke gets back.</i>

01:24.877 --> 01:28.130
<i>It's not the best job in the world,
but I do have a really good parking spot.</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:32.092
President Kennedy would like to extend
his personal apologies

01:32.176 --> 01:35.137
and to assure you that the administration
is doing everything we can

01:35.220 --> 01:37.389
to get you home just as soon as possible.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.100
<i>Well, please tell the president
that we appreciate the sentiment,</i>

01:40.184 --> 01:41.560
<i>but we're doing just fine.</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:43.103
<i>Jamestown Base is operational</i>

01:43.187 --> 01:45.606
<i>and will remain so
until we're properly relieved.</i>

01:45.689 --> 01:47.399
We got plenty of work to keep us busy.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.153
In fact, we're coming up
on a scheduled evolution right now.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.530
<i>Understood. Houston out.</i>

01:54.198 --> 01:55.199
Jamestown out.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.623
True American heroes doing God's work.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.376
I can only imagine
what it's like up there for them.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.723
<i>That's a really nice piece of equipment,
Dr. Hartley.</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:21.683
<i>Yeah, I have to get it hooked up.</i>

02:21.767 --> 02:25.687
<i>Why don't you let me do it for you?
I was a demolitions expert in the marines.</i>

02:26.688 --> 02:28.565
Guy is really familiar.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.485
Maybe 'cause we've probably seen this one
about 500 times.

02:31.568 --> 02:35.239
No, it's not that.
He's been on another TV show.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.658
John Fiedler. Character actor.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.826
Does a lot of TV.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.706
<i>Get Smart</i>,
<i>Courtship of Eddie's Father</i>, <i>Bewitched.</i>

02:44.790 --> 02:46.875
Anything about TV you don't know?

02:47.584 --> 02:49.002
No, there is not.

02:49.545 --> 02:53.090
Watched a lot of TV while my mama
cleaned white ladies' houses in Memphis.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.676
Hey, Dani, can you hand me that toolbox?

02:55.759 --> 02:56.760
Yeah.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.390
<i>I don't know if it'll stretch that far.
It comes in a little egg.</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:09.439
The ants are building their same tunnels.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.776
Same as they were yesterday
and the day before that.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.696
-Yeah.
-And the day before that...

03:15.779 --> 03:18.991
<i>I was afraid of my wife,
I was afraid of growing old.</i>

03:19.074 --> 03:20.909
-"I was afraid of geese."
-"I was afraid of geese."

03:22.661 --> 03:25.539
<i>If I remember correctly,
you were afraid to get in your car.</i>

03:25.622 --> 03:28.625
"Well, that was during the period
when I was afraid of upholstery."

03:29.960 --> 03:32.379
Was he ever on <i>Lost in Space</i>?

03:32.462 --> 03:33.463
<i>Star Trek</i>.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.549
Now you're just showing off.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.302
Showing off would be telling you
that he played Mr. Hengist.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.720
Still no signal.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.224
Dani, you sure you had a good connection
on the S-band leads

03:44.308 --> 03:45.976
-when you hooked up the line?
-Yep.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.353
Two green lights. Solid connection.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.106
<i>My gift is
you don't have to come here anymore.</i>

03:51.815 --> 03:56.236
<i>You're free to go out
and face your own problems without me.</i>

03:56.945 --> 03:59.072
No way that would ever happen.

03:59.948 --> 04:04.745
Once a shrink gets you in their clutches,
that's it. You never get better.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.956
Did they ever make y'all see a shrink
when you were testing for the program?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.584
Not "a" shrink.
We saw about five in those days.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.169
You ladies got off easy.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.923
Our shrink asked me if I ever dreamt
of having sex with my father.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.257
Oh, yeah.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.926
-They ask you that too?
-Sure.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.552
-Yeah.
-Except it was,

04:21.303 --> 04:23.805
"Have you ever dreamt
of having sex with your mother?"

04:23.889 --> 04:28.268
Yeah, the docs love asking the "Have you
had sex with a parent dream" question.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.437
They're just hoping someone's
gonna say yes one day.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.856
-Yeah. What would that tell them?
-Means you're gay.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.943
-Really?
-To shrinks, everything means you're gay.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.237
That's why you don't go voluntarily.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.321
Right, but--

04:42.157 --> 04:43.951
Shit! Shit.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.244
Don't mess up my deck.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.204
Don't kill any ants.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.375
Thanks for your help, guys.
Really. Appreciate it.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.293
<i>...sort of 2,000-mile checkup.</i>

04:54.962 --> 04:56.338
-<i>Hi, Bob.</i>
-"Hi, Bob."

04:56.421 --> 04:58.215
-"Hi, Bob."
-"Hi, Bob."

06:23.759 --> 06:26.094
How'd your interview go with Levi Strauss?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.932
<i>I didn't get it.</i>

06:33.310 --> 06:34.603
Had a bad day.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.314
Hand kept shaking.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.026
Probably thought I was a drug addict
or something.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.572
<i>What did Dr. Corey say?</i>

06:46.573 --> 06:47.783
Canceled that.

06:48.617 --> 06:51.870
I don't need someone
digging around in my head,

06:51.954 --> 06:53.580
tryin' to make it seem like I'm crazy.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.375
<i>That's not what it's about, honey.
He's just trying to help.</i>

06:56.458 --> 06:57.459
I don't need help.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.632
I need something besides bagging groceries
to make a living.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.260
<i>We're doing fine on my salary, Clay.</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:08.220
A man's not supposed to live off his wife.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.722
-Okay? It ain't right.
-<i>Times change, baby.</i>

07:10.806 --> 07:13.392
All right, I can do more
than bag groceries.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.476
<i>Of course you can.</i>

07:16.270 --> 07:18.230
I got a college degree.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.692
<i>I led a platoon in Vietnam.</i>

07:21.775 --> 07:24.319
<i>You know,
that man in that interview, he...</i>

07:27.489 --> 07:31.869
<i>He didn't even see me. He was just
looking at me sitting there, hand shaking.</i>

07:31.952 --> 07:33.412
You'll get the next one, Clay.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.080
<i>I know you will.</i>

07:35.163 --> 07:36.707
Couldn't even answer the questions.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.630
I kept getting confused.

07:43.714 --> 07:48.260
It was like my mind was slipping
into this hole, you know?

07:50.012 --> 07:53.515
It was this dark hole
that I could feel pulling me in.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.559
<i>Clayton?</i>

07:55.642 --> 07:58.979
Pulling me down, you know,
I could feel it pulling me down.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.106
<i>And I wanted to go.</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:04.568
<i>Like I was hoping
to get deep down in the dark.</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:07.487
<i>And at the same time,
I'm like, "Shit," you know?</i>

08:09.698 --> 08:13.243
<i>'Cause I know... I know something
is waiting down there for me.</i>

08:13.327 --> 08:15.746
-Clayton?
-<i>It's gonna get me the second I look away.</i>

08:15.829 --> 08:16.914
It's okay, honey.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.416
It is okay.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.877
There is no hole.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.671
There is nothing down there
waiting to get you.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.550
-You have to believe me.
-<i>Hey, look, baby.</i>

08:28.634 --> 08:31.470
<i>I gotta go, baby.
Okay? Look, I'm out of cigarettes.</i>

08:31.553 --> 08:33.679
-We still have more time.
-<i>I'll talk to you next week.</i>

08:33.764 --> 08:36.183
-<i>Okay, I love you.</i>
-Sit down, Clay. We--

08:45.317 --> 08:49.488
Your psych profile indicates
a predisposition toward claustrophobia.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.573
Odd thing to see in an astronaut.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.909
It was a childhood fear.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.494
I got over it.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.625
They told me my answers were confidential.

09:01.708 --> 09:06.004
In fact, they said my entire medical file
was highly confidential

09:06.088 --> 09:11.093
and not to worry about
anyone just flipping through it.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.803
Does this worry you?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.389
No, it annoys me.

09:15.931 --> 09:20.602
Well, the FBI certainly doesn't want
to annoy you, Miss Waverly.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.396
Too late.

09:24.690 --> 09:28.485
You're aware that I have the power
to yank your security clearance

09:28.569 --> 09:30.070
and bounce you out of the program.

09:30.153 --> 09:34.783
I'm aware that the only reason I'm here
is because you think my boyfriend is gay.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.328
Which I find both outrageous
and offensive.

09:39.246 --> 09:43.584
Larry is a red-blooded American man
with completely normal desires,

09:43.667 --> 09:46.920
and I won't sit here while
you cast aspersions on his character.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.800
We're not actually here to talk about
your boyfriend, Miss Waverly.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.468
We're here to talk about you.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.180
Me?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.890
I can't figure out your story.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.850
It's not that complicated.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.729
Your mother's New York old money.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.481
Your father becomes a pilot in the '20s.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.609
He knew Amelia Earhart, is that true?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.027
And Charles Lindbergh.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.487
He starts his own air freight company
in the '30s.

10:12.571 --> 10:15.073
After the war,
he's a self-made millionaire.

10:15.157 --> 10:19.119
Starts Cavalier Airlines in '48.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.830
He gives you the flying bug.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.875
You get a pilot license as a teenager.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.960
MIT, aeronautical engineering.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.712
Dad hires you at Cavalier,

10:28.795 --> 10:32.382
and you work there until
NASA starts looking for female astronauts.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.844
Doesn't make an ounce of sense.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.683
You can't understand
why a woman wants to be an astronaut?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.977
I can't understand why Ellen Waverly,

10:44.061 --> 10:48.607
heiress, aeronautical engineer,
pilot and now astronaut,

10:49.107 --> 10:50.359
is with Larry Wilson.

10:51.735 --> 10:52.945
He's a good man.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.029
He's a homosexual.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.697
-You're wrong.
-I doubt it.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.115
Why? Have you slept with him?

10:57.199 --> 10:58.951
No, have you?

10:59.034 --> 11:01.578
I don't think
that is any of your business.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.871
Tell me about your first kiss.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.456
-It was at the movies.
-What movie?

11:04.540 --> 11:06.250
-<i>Ryan's Daughter</i>.
-What part?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.544
When Rosy and Major Doryan make love
in the meadow.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.295
Odd time to take your eyes off the screen.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.547
We were caught up in the moment.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.382
I just don't know why you're doing this.

11:13.966 --> 11:16.093
I'm not doing anything.

11:16.176 --> 11:20.180
Except trying to keep you from
smearing the name of a perfectly good man.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.057
You're helping him hide a secret

11:22.140 --> 11:25.936
at great personal risk to yourself,
your reputation and your career.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.022
Why?

11:30.148 --> 11:31.275
I can't figure it.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.321
But I will.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.539
He didn't buy it.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.126
It was a worth a shot.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.254
Sometimes the aggressive tack
throws 'em off.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.340
How much longer is this crap gonna go on?

11:55.424 --> 11:58.302
No way to know yet.
But we shouldn't trust the phone.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.222
Don't they need a warrant
to tap our phones?

12:04.850 --> 12:06.101
J. Edgar Hoover may be dead,

12:06.185 --> 12:08.896
but the feds are still lawless pricks

12:08.979 --> 12:11.565
when it comes to protecting Americans
against sexual perverts,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.609
so don't trust the phones.

12:13.692 --> 12:14.776
Jesus.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.614
<i>And back in Washington,</i>

12:18.697 --> 12:23.076
<i>accusations of an extramarital affair
between President Ted Kennedy</i>

12:23.160 --> 12:26.663
<i>and a White House staffer
named Mary Jo Kopechne</i>

12:26.747 --> 12:29.166
<i>continue to roil the White House today.</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:32.669
<i>This follows last week's publication
of photographs</i>

12:32.753 --> 12:35.464
<i>which appear to show the president
and Miss Kopechne</i>

12:35.547 --> 12:37.758
<i>in Palm Beach, Florida, last winter...</i>

12:37.841 --> 12:40.594
Maybe the FBI should be
looking into his sex life.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.024
Is that the Russian carrier wave?

12:54.566 --> 12:57.528
It's not ours, so it's gotta be theirs.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.739
Could be Gordo's red blinky people.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.741
I never said they were blinky people.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.786
Just red lights.

13:05.869 --> 13:09.456
You also said you ain't been nipping
at that last bottle of Chivas, either.

13:10.249 --> 13:11.875
That bottle's been in my protection,

13:11.959 --> 13:15.379
and it has not been touched
by man or beast in weeks.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.466
It's transmitting again.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.261
What is that? Is that telemetry?

13:22.344 --> 13:25.556
No, it's a short-range VHF transmitter.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.685
The Russian telemetry
is on a different frequency.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.230
But it has to be voice,
and it's encrypted.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.066
Well, they're obviously doing something
they don't want us to know about.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.026
Like what?

13:38.443 --> 13:41.196
Installing surveillance materials.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.782
-Maybe weapons.
-Do you really believe that?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.911
Why would you want weapons on the moon?
Who you gonna be shooting at?

13:47.995 --> 13:50.205
You, me, Gordo.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.041
Well, everybody wants to shoot at Gordo.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.294
I heard that.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.300
-Holy shit!
-Shit.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.051
-Goddamn it.
-There's another one.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.637
-You okay?
-I saw at least two back behind the rack.

14:05.721 --> 14:09.224
-You talking about the ants?
-Yeah, I'm talking about the ants.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.688
We need eyes on that base.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.940
You wanna start spying on the Soviets?

14:17.816 --> 14:19.943
They're spying on us. I guarantee it.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.321
Pick up your feet.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.447
Pick 'em up.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.824
Shit.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.244
Tomorrow I want to take the rover
and head along Broadway.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.707
Swing around Mayberry and then
up the western slope of Mount Pilot.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.668
See if there's any sign the Russians
have been on our side of the crater.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.837
We're supposed to be gathering
ore samples tomorrow.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.590
Yeah, we're gonna take a little detour.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.675
You gonna tell Houston?

14:44.885 --> 14:46.386
We don't encrypt our communications,

14:46.470 --> 14:49.306
so we gotta assume the Russians
are listening to everything we say.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.099
Are you sure you wanna do this?

14:53.227 --> 14:54.853
Prep the rover for an extended run.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.231
Gordo, let it go, man.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.732
Can't just let 'em run around in here.

14:58.815 --> 15:02.319
What if they get in the circuitry
and short something out?

15:03.028 --> 15:04.530
What if they get in the food?

15:04.613 --> 15:07.157
Well, I could use
a little something crunchy in my oatmeal.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.617
This isn't funny.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.828
Those ants are NASA property,
and we're responsible for 'em.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.998
Easy there, sailor.
No one's making fun of your ants, okay?

15:15.082 --> 15:18.836
Fine. Let 'em run all over the place.
I don't give a shit.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.056
The damage estimate is $150

15:31.139 --> 15:33.225
to remove the offending words
and repaint the lockers.

15:33.308 --> 15:37.020
That's a bit much for a bucket of paint
and a brush, don't you think?

15:37.104 --> 15:39.815
Well, the cost is not really the issue,
Mrs. Stevens.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.901
I'd like to talk about
the relationship between the boys.

15:43.569 --> 15:46.238
My concern is that
it's becoming unhealthy and damaging--

15:46.321 --> 15:47.906
-They're friends.
-Best friends.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.449
Practically grew up together.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.285
And that's not us defending them.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.954
What they did is inappropriate and wrong,
and they'll be punished for it.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.290
Absolutely, but speaking of which,

15:56.373 --> 16:00.127
maybe that's part of the problem,
is a lack of discipline in this school.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.422
Is it true
you've stopped paddling students?

16:04.882 --> 16:07.467
Corporal punishment in schools
is becoming frowned on

16:07.551 --> 16:08.802
in modern educational circles.

16:08.886 --> 16:12.264
Well, spanking was not frowned upon
in my home,

16:12.347 --> 16:13.807
and now I'm an astronaut.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.559
So what does that tell you?

16:16.351 --> 16:18.187
I think we're getting
a little off-topic here.

16:18.854 --> 16:23.150
I think that the relationship,
the friendship, between Danny and Shane,

16:23.233 --> 16:25.110
while genuine and heartfelt...

16:26.153 --> 16:28.071
is becoming unhealthy,
particularly for Danny.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.784
-What?
-For Danny?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.661
Yes, Mrs. Stevens.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.831
The teachers all agree that your son
is the follower in this situation,

16:37.915 --> 16:39.791
and that if it were not
for the influence of Shane,

16:39.875 --> 16:42.669
he would probably not be participating
in activities like--

16:42.753 --> 16:44.588
-My son is a follower?
-No.

16:44.671 --> 16:48.008
-He's weak and he sucks up to his friends?
-Shane is the problem here? Huh? Yeah?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.718
-Is that what you're saying?
-Is that what you're saying?

16:52.513 --> 16:54.890
I'm saying there's a dynamic at play here.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.727
Shane is a natural leader,
Danny wants to please him,

16:58.810 --> 17:00.979
and the results are
toxic, antisocial behavior.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.315
I'm not listening to any more of this.
Let's go.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.902
This is outrageous. I will be contacting
Superintendent Jones about this.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.493
-What a jackass.
-He's...

17:18.497 --> 17:20.540
-I don't believe him.
-'Course not.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.844
Houston, we're back at the ranch now,

17:31.927 --> 17:36.139
so we'll be going off VOX,
and we'll talk to you after dinner.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.308
<i>Roger that. What's for dinner tonight?</i>

17:38.392 --> 17:40.769
I think Gordo's making beef stroganoff.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.646
Someone should tell the mess steward

17:42.729 --> 17:45.983
serving Russian food on an American base
isn't exactly kosher.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.735
<i>I'll send your note to the kitchen, Ed.
Houston out.</i>

18:03.917 --> 18:05.210
So you satisfied?

18:06.336 --> 18:09.756
We ran off 30 kilometers on the rover and
didn't see a single sign of the Russians.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.301
I'm satisfied in terms of what we saw,

18:13.010 --> 18:14.595
but the Soviets are crafty.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.806
I know. I fought these guys
and their stooges in Korea.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.185
They're always trying to gain an advantage
in any kind of situation.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.855
We didn't even come close
to covering our part of the crater today.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.940
So tomorrow,
we'll have to recon another sector.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.401
"Our part."

18:29.484 --> 18:32.988
I love that it's our part now,
like somehow we own it.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.407
Kind of it how it works, you know?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.536
Whoever plants the flag first, owns it.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.996
Ask the Pilgrims.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.332
And what if I ask the Indians?

18:44.124 --> 18:45.125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.795
Uh-oh.

18:52.841 --> 18:53.842
Shit.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.628
No one's been here before.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.632
No one's seen this before.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.469
Now I have.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.031
Hi, Bob.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.492
Don't fucking "Hi, Bob" me.

20:03.704 --> 20:04.705
What are you doing?

20:04.788 --> 20:06.957
Just a little apartment hunting.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.625
No one got hurt.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.044
We're out on the rover, and you go AWOL?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.173
We talked about this last time.

20:15.549 --> 20:18.719
You don't leave the base
without authorization, ever.

20:20.888 --> 20:24.766
Houston finds out about this, they'll
ground you the rest of your natural life.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.644
Well,
first they gotta get me off this rock,

20:28.437 --> 20:30.731
and they ain't doing
such a good job of that.

20:37.446 --> 20:40.324
What if you'd gotten into trouble,
and none of us knew where you were?

20:40.407 --> 20:43.660
I'm sorry, Mommy. Next time
I'll leave a note on the refrigerator.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.162
You think this is funny?

20:46.246 --> 20:48.916
I think this is
about 15 pounds of bullshit.

20:50.167 --> 20:54.296
You and Dani are cruising around
looking for commie spies that don't exist,

20:54.379 --> 20:57.049
and I'm pretty sure you didn't say squat
about that to Houston.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.510
No, 'cause we were
maintaining radio security

20:59.593 --> 21:01.470
while on a mission to protect this base.

21:01.553 --> 21:03.680
Protect this base? Protect what?

21:04.181 --> 21:05.474
This hunk of junk?

21:07.059 --> 21:10.145
I mean, the shower only works
half the time. The food is lousy.

21:10.229 --> 21:13.106
The toilet's backed up so much
you barely even notice the smell anymore.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.816
-The Soviets are out there.
-The Soviets.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.361
And they're a threat to this base.
You saw them yourself!

21:17.444 --> 21:20.948
I never said they were Soviets.
Just things.

21:21.031 --> 21:22.407
You said you saw red blinking lights.

21:22.491 --> 21:24.910
There's no other rational explanation
for that than the Soviets.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.703
Unless there wasn't anything
out there at all.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.622
-Dani. No.
-What are you trying to say, Dani? Huh?

21:28.705 --> 21:30.207
-What are you saying?
-Don't go yelling at me.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.416
-What are you trying to say?
-Gordo.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.627
You think I'm making this up?
See? That's what you do.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.838
You cut me down
to make me look like I don't belong.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.464
You're trying to make me look like a fool!

21:37.548 --> 21:38.549
I said stand down!

21:38.632 --> 21:39.925
You're on her side now?
You're both against me.

21:40.008 --> 21:43.136
-I said stand down.
-What do you wanna do? You wanna hit me?

21:43.220 --> 21:45.138
Give it your best shot.
You think you're man enough?

21:47.391 --> 21:49.977
Step back! Step back!

21:50.060 --> 21:52.354
Everybody, just calm down and step back!

22:08.579 --> 22:12.332
You're confined to this base
until further notice.

22:15.294 --> 22:16.753
Confined to the base?

22:19.131 --> 22:20.215
Confined?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.930
Oh, me, oh, my. What am I gonna do?

22:27.639 --> 22:29.391
Heavens to Betsy.

22:29.474 --> 22:31.018
I'm confined to the base.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.437
Jesus Christ. I don't need this bullshit.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.903
I'm confined.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.115
I'm telling you, Ed.
This is starting to get out of hand.

22:45.199 --> 22:46.533
Enough, Danielle.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.203
Yes, sir.

22:49.745 --> 22:52.623
I will just shut my mouth
like a good little girl

22:52.706 --> 22:54.041
and let you handle all of this.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.125
Thank you.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.900
How to put this?

23:22.778 --> 23:26.406
Well, Agent Donahue is of the opinion

23:26.490 --> 23:31.954
that Larry Wilson may have
certain tendencies

23:32.579 --> 23:35.624
which could pose a security risk
to the program.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.460
He thinks Larry's gay.

23:39.753 --> 23:40.754
Yes.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.924
And now he has voiced a theory

23:44.007 --> 23:49.721
that perhaps you may have
certain tendencies as well.

23:49.805 --> 23:50.931
That's absurd.

23:53.058 --> 23:56.103
This is not a good time

23:56.186 --> 23:59.273
for the administration to be forced
to deal with another scandal.

23:59.356 --> 24:00.899
Another sex scanda--

24:00.983 --> 24:03.986
Yeah, I understand
that Teddy's been a very bad boy.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.320
It's not funny.

24:06.405 --> 24:10.075
The attack on the president
is a debasement of the culture and nation.

24:11.201 --> 24:15.122
All the more reason why a NASA astronaut's
private what-have-yous

24:15.205 --> 24:17.207
should not be made public at this time.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.750
I'm not gay.

24:19.751 --> 24:23.755
But I can't control Gavin Donahue
or the Justice Department.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.007
No.

24:25.424 --> 24:27.217
But you could...

24:28.468 --> 24:31.180
you and Larry both could take a step.

24:32.723 --> 24:38.395
A step which would make these accusations
against the both of you seem ridiculous.

24:45.986 --> 24:49.448
I can assure you we're doing all we can
to get the relief crew up there.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.783
-I'm sure you are, Buzz.
-What's he saying?

24:51.867 --> 24:55.329
-You gotta watch the gears.
-Don't tell me what to do. I see it.

24:55.871 --> 24:56.914
Flashlight.

24:58.957 --> 25:04.171
<i>Our new estimate for the launch
of Apollo 24 is December 9.</i>

25:05.172 --> 25:07.966
-It's the damn ants, isn't it?
-It wasn't the ants. It's the tape.

25:08.050 --> 25:09.593
Two more weeks.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.677
Got it.

25:11.762 --> 25:13.055
BOHICA.

25:13.138 --> 25:16.433
<i>But the good news is the unmanned Titan
launched perfectly this morning</i>

25:16.517 --> 25:18.310
<i>and should be there in five days.</i>

25:18.769 --> 25:20.938
<i>And we have a little surprise
for you this time.</i>

25:21.021 --> 25:22.356
Love surprises.

25:22.439 --> 25:23.732
Needle-nose pliers.

25:25.526 --> 25:26.527
Okay.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.029
Here we go.

25:37.621 --> 25:40.249
I don't suppose you're sending us
a new batch of videotapes?

25:40.624 --> 25:42.835
<i>Of what? Oh, no. No.</i>

25:42.918 --> 25:45.420
<i>NASA's still having trouble
with the Hollywood studios.</i>

25:45.504 --> 25:48.799
<i>They don't want people thinking
they can just record their shows at home.</i>

25:48.882 --> 25:51.969
<i>It'd eat into their advertising revenue
if they skip the commercials.</i>

25:52.469 --> 25:56.306
<i>But we did manage to include a whole
new plumbing assembly for the shower.</i>

25:57.432 --> 25:59.977
Great. I'm looking forward to that.
Thank you.

26:00.894 --> 26:02.229
<i>How's Gordo's cold?</i>

26:04.898 --> 26:07.025
He's feeling better.

26:08.861 --> 26:10.696
Should be back to work real soon.

26:11.196 --> 26:12.698
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

26:12.781 --> 26:15.868
<i>I'll give you further updates on 24
as they become available.</i>

26:15.951 --> 26:17.035
<i>Houston out.</i>

26:17.119 --> 26:18.245
Jamestown out.

26:21.582 --> 26:22.916
Can it be saved?

26:37.723 --> 26:40.392
-<i>I'd like to introduce my second surprise.</i>
-There it is.

26:40.809 --> 26:44.479
<i>She's a new member to our group,
and she's also afraid of flying.</i>

26:44.563 --> 26:46.815
<i>Isn't that nice?</i>

26:49.318 --> 26:51.862
<i>Emily, do you want to explain
what led to your fear of flying?</i>

26:52.404 --> 26:55.199
<i>Well, I don't think
anybody would be interested in my story.</i>

26:55.282 --> 26:58.035
<i>I just thought I'd sit and listen tonight.</i>

26:59.661 --> 27:02.039
<i>I feel you have a lot of hostility
toward me.</i>

27:07.586 --> 27:08.962
<i>Why do you say that, Mr. Carlin?</i>

27:10.172 --> 27:12.049
No. No!

27:17.679 --> 27:20.641
Sorry, guys. That was the best I could do.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.854
What are we gonna do now?

27:37.241 --> 27:40.661
"I'd like to introduce my second surprise.
My wife, Emily.

27:40.744 --> 27:44.414
Emily is the newest member of our group
and also afraid of flying."

27:44.498 --> 27:46.500
"Isn't that nice?"

27:48.460 --> 27:52.256
"Emily, would you like to explain
what led to your fear of flying?"

27:52.339 --> 27:55.133
"I don't think
anybody would be interested in my story.

27:55.217 --> 27:57.177
I thought
I'd just sit and listen tonight."

27:57.261 --> 27:59.930
"I feel you have a lot of hostility
toward me."

28:02.516 --> 28:05.018
"Emily?
Why would you say that, Mr. Carlin?"

28:05.102 --> 28:07.688
"Because Emily,
by refusing to tell her story,

28:07.771 --> 28:10.524
is implying that
her fear is better than mine.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.110
I don't like it, I feel threatened by it,

28:13.527 --> 28:15.153
and I don't know how to deal with it."

28:16.655 --> 28:19.283
"Emily, do you have hostility
towards Mr. Carlin?"

28:19.366 --> 28:23.036
"No. I just didn't think
anybody would be interested in my story.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.455
I really just thought
I'd sit and listen tonight."

28:25.539 --> 28:27.541
"You know, I like you for saying that."

28:27.624 --> 28:30.711
"Thank you. I like you too, very much."

28:30.794 --> 28:31.962
"I don't believe you."

28:39.052 --> 28:40.888
-Okay. Let's go again.
-Let's keep going.

28:40.971 --> 28:42.764
Okay, okay.

28:47.603 --> 28:51.607
<i>Well, this is an embarrassment
to your entire family.</i>

28:52.107 --> 28:53.358
<i>Do you realize that?</i>

28:54.443 --> 28:55.986
-Yes, sir.
-<i>Speak up!</i>

28:56.945 --> 28:57.946
Yes, sir.

29:02.409 --> 29:04.912
<i>You're supposed to be
the man of the house while I'm away.</i>

29:06.830 --> 29:10.667
<i>Supposed to help your mother with all
the new responsibilities she's taken on.</i>

29:10.751 --> 29:13.837
<i>But, instead, you're running around,
acting like some kinda little punk?</i>

29:22.012 --> 29:23.597
And right before Thanksgiving.

29:29.186 --> 29:31.146
I'm very disappointed in you, Shane.

29:35.692 --> 29:36.860
And now the tears.

29:39.655 --> 29:42.658
You're 11 years old, Shane.

29:42.741 --> 29:46.662
<i>When are you gonna stop acting like
a little baby and start acting like a man?</i>

29:47.538 --> 29:48.830
-I don't know.
-Just stop.

29:48.914 --> 29:51.250
-<i>Stop the crying, all right? Cut it out.</i>
-I got work to do here.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.170
I don't have time
for your little baby shenanigans.

29:55.254 --> 29:57.589
<i>I'll handle it from here, Ed, okay?</i>

29:57.673 --> 29:59.174
<i>Shane, say goodbye to your father.</i>

30:00.676 --> 30:01.677
Bye.

30:02.636 --> 30:03.846
<i>Goodbye, Shane.</i>

30:10.477 --> 30:14.064
Houston, we're ascending
from the mining site with fresh samples.

30:14.523 --> 30:17.025
<i>Copy that, Ed.
Hope Gordo feels better soon.</i>

30:17.109 --> 30:19.987
<i>Bet you could use another pair of hands
processing the ice.</i>

30:20.070 --> 30:21.572
We surely could, Houston.

30:22.114 --> 30:25.117
And I'm sure Gordo's dying
to get back to work as well.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.994
<i>Copy that. Houston out.</i>

30:28.912 --> 30:32.708
Ed, how long you gonna keep Gordo
under house arrest?

30:33.208 --> 30:35.711
I think the flight surgeons are beginning
to get a little worried

30:35.794 --> 30:36.962
about his head cold.

30:37.045 --> 30:38.338
He's on the mend.

30:38.422 --> 30:40.132
He was almost back to his normal self
the other day,

30:40.215 --> 30:42.551
goofing around, acting out that episode.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.053
He just needs a break.

30:46.263 --> 30:48.974
I'm getting a bad vibe from him lately,

30:49.057 --> 30:53.061
like something just isn't computing
in his head anymore.

30:54.438 --> 30:55.689
Look, Gordo's tough.

30:56.857 --> 30:57.941
He'll be fine.

31:01.278 --> 31:03.197
After I got shot down in Korea,

31:03.280 --> 31:07.367
I had a few days back in Seoul
where the walls were closing in on me too.

31:08.452 --> 31:09.786
-You got shot down?
-Yeah.

31:10.412 --> 31:13.290
Supporting a strike mission
just north of the 38th parallel.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.756
There was another pilot that crash-landed,
and I was flying cover above him

31:20.839 --> 31:23.217
when I got clipped by antiaircraft fire.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.471
Two of us spent a week evading the enemy
before I made it back to our lines.

31:28.222 --> 31:29.681
Before you made it back?

31:32.684 --> 31:33.894
He didn't make it.

31:36.730 --> 31:37.731
I'm sorry, Ed.

31:38.232 --> 31:39.483
It was a long time ago.

31:40.025 --> 31:41.568
But the point of the story...

31:43.779 --> 31:48.534
is that when I got back to Seoul,
I was tightly wound.

31:50.327 --> 31:54.748
I even got short-tempered
with a couple of my superiors.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.041
Short-tempered?

31:56.667 --> 31:58.544
I took a swing at a colonel.

31:59.670 --> 32:02.256
They put me in a hotel room,
gave me a bottle of scotch and said,

32:02.339 --> 32:04.466
"Don't come back
until your head's straight."

32:07.177 --> 32:09.137
Locked myself in that room,

32:09.930 --> 32:14.309
resurfaced a few days later,
right as rain.

32:16.395 --> 32:17.813
Gordo needs a little time.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.648
Okay.

32:25.404 --> 32:29.533
Well, I used to think the same thing
about Clayton.

32:29.616 --> 32:33.120
-You know, that he just needed some time.
-Yeah.

32:33.203 --> 32:38.375
But now it's like
he's a different man altogether.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.794
A man I don't know anymore.

32:43.088 --> 32:44.590
Oh, shit.

32:56.727 --> 32:57.978
Oh, my God.

32:58.896 --> 33:01.773
<i>We shouldn't be talking about this
on an open channel, Commander.</i>

33:01.857 --> 33:04.693
Well, I agree with you, sir,
but I think the Soviets knew full well

33:04.776 --> 33:07.070
we'd find their tracks
and report back to NASA.

33:07.154 --> 33:09.281
<i>I'll inform the White House,</i>

33:09.364 --> 33:12.075
<i>and they'll summon the Soviet ambassador,</i>

33:12.159 --> 33:16.580
<i>and I'm sure that they will demand
some answers regarding this incident.</i>

33:18.123 --> 33:19.416
Copy that, sir.

33:19.499 --> 33:24.004
And how do you want us to...
proceed here on the moon?

33:26.131 --> 33:28.800
<i>Continue your normal operations,
Commander.</i>

33:30.010 --> 33:34.640
<i>Do nothing to provoke an incident
with the Russian cosmonauts.</i>

33:35.557 --> 33:39.770
<i>We will handle everything
through diplomatic channels from now on.</i>

33:41.146 --> 33:42.231
Aye, aye, sir.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.741
That's insane. I can't believe
he'd even suggest that to you.

33:52.824 --> 33:54.451
Do you think Weisner knows?

33:54.910 --> 33:56.245
He doesn't want to know.

33:58.455 --> 34:00.374
He's hoping
this whole thing just goes away.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.378
Teddy's little Palm Beach fling
has got them all squeamish

34:04.461 --> 34:06.171
about anything to do with sex right now.

34:06.255 --> 34:10.759
Last thing they need is a scandal
about a dyke astronaut and a fag engineer.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.678
I've told you before,
I don't like those terms.

34:12.761 --> 34:14.929
This gets out,
we're gonna be called much worse.

34:15.013 --> 34:16.514
Then we can't let it get out.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.936
You're not seriously considering this?

34:22.688 --> 34:26.525
I don't know. I think we have to put
all the options on the table.

34:27.650 --> 34:28.652
What?

34:28.735 --> 34:31.612
There is a certain simplicity to the idea.

34:32.906 --> 34:35.074
It would redefine us
in the eyes of the world.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.953
Much harder for anyone to question us
if we've taken that step.

34:38.036 --> 34:39.036
Right.

34:39.121 --> 34:42.583
Okay. I'm just gonna say this once,
and I want it on the record.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.003
You do this,
you actually go through with this,

34:46.085 --> 34:49.005
this thing that I can't even say out loud,

34:49.422 --> 34:52.926
you do this, then you and I, we're done.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.638
Pam, I'm just considering all the options.

34:56.722 --> 34:58.849
No, this isn't an option.
This isn't an idea.

34:58.932 --> 35:00.309
This isn't even a possibility.

35:00.976 --> 35:03.187
Hey, it wouldn't mean anything.

35:03.270 --> 35:04.438
It would to me.

35:05.314 --> 35:06.940
It would mean everything.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.068
I love you.

35:12.946 --> 35:14.448
-Okay?
-Okay.

35:16.325 --> 35:18.660
There. Now it's been said,
and I said it because it had to be said,

35:18.744 --> 35:20.162
and I know you never would.

35:27.044 --> 35:28.795
-I don't know, I--
-This...

35:30.339 --> 35:31.757
This is too big.

35:32.508 --> 35:36.553
What you guys are talking about doing,
it is important.

35:36.637 --> 35:37.930
It's deep.

35:38.764 --> 35:41.266
I know it may not be cool or hip
to say that these days,

35:41.350 --> 35:44.353
but it is how I feel,
and I feel it in my bones.

35:44.436 --> 35:45.646
So you do this...

35:47.898 --> 35:48.899
we're done.

37:02.389 --> 37:03.390
Ed.

37:04.892 --> 37:06.059
Dani. Up and at 'em.

37:06.143 --> 37:08.103
Come on, it's time. Let's go. It's time.

37:08.187 --> 37:09.188
It's time.

37:09.271 --> 37:11.607
Okay, Ed, this time
you're gonna play Mr. Carlin.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.650
Dani, you're gonna play
all the women, as usual.

37:13.734 --> 37:14.902
I'm gonna be Bob.

37:16.612 --> 37:18.906
-Gordo, what the hell are you--
-Let's go. Come on, Ed.

37:18.989 --> 37:20.032
What the hell is--

37:20.115 --> 37:21.158
And...

37:21.867 --> 37:23.994
"I'd like to introduce my second surprise.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.287
This is my wife, Emily.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.207
She's a new member to the group,
and she's also afraid of flying."

37:28.290 --> 37:30.250
What are you doing?
It's the middle of the night.

37:30.334 --> 37:32.002
Mrs. Bakerman has the next line.

37:33.212 --> 37:34.213
Mrs. Bakerman.

37:35.464 --> 37:36.507
That's you.

37:39.885 --> 37:41.678
"Isn't that nice?"

37:41.762 --> 37:45.432
"Emily, you wanna explain
what first led to your fear of flying?"

37:45.516 --> 37:48.143
Gordo, quit this horsing around.
We got a busy day tomorrow.

37:49.019 --> 37:50.020
Gordo.

37:50.812 --> 37:51.813
Get up.

37:52.773 --> 37:53.774
Get up.

37:57.277 --> 37:58.487
I'll do it.

38:01.782 --> 38:04.701
"I didn't think
anyone would be interested in my story.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.870
I just thought
I'd sit and listen tonight."

38:09.873 --> 38:12.793
"I feel you have a lot of hostility
toward me." Small laugh.

38:15.754 --> 38:17.381
"And why do you say that, Mr. Carlin?"

38:18.215 --> 38:20.717
"Because Emily,
by refusing to tell her story,

38:20.801 --> 38:22.886
is implying that
her fear is better than mine.

38:22.970 --> 38:26.515
I don't like it, I feel threatened by it,
and I don't know how to deal with it."

38:26.598 --> 38:27.599
Medium laugh.

38:27.683 --> 38:29.768
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm doing the first episode.

38:29.852 --> 38:33.021
"Fly the Unfriendly Skies."
Okay? You're getting in the way.

38:35.774 --> 38:39.111
"Emily, do you have hostility
to Mr. Carlin?"

38:40.112 --> 38:43.824
"No. I just didn't think
anyone would be interested in my story.

38:43.907 --> 38:46.034
-I just thought I'd and sit and listen--"
-The hell are you doing?

38:46.118 --> 38:49.246
You're stepping on the joke!
You're stepping on the joke. Stop.

38:51.373 --> 38:52.583
Where was I?

38:52.666 --> 38:53.667
Mr. Carlin.

38:55.878 --> 38:57.504
"You know, I like you for saying that."

38:58.839 --> 39:00.507
"Thank you."

39:00.591 --> 39:03.427
Ed, I think
maybe you need to call Houston.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.971
-"I don't believe you." Big laugh.
-No.

39:06.388 --> 39:08.348
Absolutely not. But you're right.

39:08.432 --> 39:12.269
He's been cooped up in here for too long.
He needs to get outside, clear his head.

39:12.352 --> 39:13.604
Okay.

39:13.687 --> 39:16.398
"Right. Well, I was in college.

39:16.481 --> 39:18.275
It was just a little thing.

39:18.358 --> 39:20.402
-A bunch of us were going to Ann Arbor--"
-Gordo.

39:20.485 --> 39:23.363
Gordo. Gordo. Hey.

39:24.865 --> 39:26.992
Let's go for a walk. Outside.

39:27.075 --> 39:28.535
Just the two of us.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.246
-A walk?
-Yeah.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.540
Do a little apartment hunting.

39:35.501 --> 39:38.212
And you can show me the great unknown
you're always talking about.

39:39.755 --> 39:41.006
What do you say?

39:43.133 --> 39:44.134
Come on, bud.

39:44.718 --> 39:46.345
Come on, buddy. Let's suit up.

40:20.629 --> 40:21.964
It's a beautiful area.

40:27.594 --> 40:28.971
We should take some pictures.

40:29.763 --> 40:30.764
No.

40:32.975 --> 40:34.309
I'll never do that.

40:36.562 --> 40:38.105
That'd spoil it.

40:38.689 --> 40:42.693
Reduce all this to just some chemicals
doing tricks on a piece of paper.

40:43.610 --> 40:46.989
No photo could ever really capture this.

40:48.282 --> 40:49.408
I know.

40:52.703 --> 40:54.204
So how you feeling?

40:56.039 --> 40:57.040
Okay.

40:58.417 --> 40:59.710
A little better, I guess.

41:00.252 --> 41:01.378
Yeah?

41:04.339 --> 41:05.632
Well, that's good.

41:08.343 --> 41:12.890
You wanna explain to me
what the hell was going on back there?

41:15.726 --> 41:16.894
I don't know.

41:17.978 --> 41:18.979
I just...

41:20.731 --> 41:22.357
I couldn't do it anymore.

41:24.026 --> 41:26.904
-Couldn't do what?
-Just stay in that room.

41:29.615 --> 41:32.576
Same walls, same lights.

41:33.243 --> 41:34.411
Same food.

41:35.579 --> 41:37.497
Fucking hell, I hate that food.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.003
I didn't sign up for this, Ed.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.632
I'm a naval aviator.

41:46.715 --> 41:50.427
Flying off carriers. Man,
I love a cat shot off a carrier at night.

41:51.762 --> 41:54.223
I got into this to push the envelope...

41:54.973 --> 41:58.352
and to fly the fastest, baddest,
hottest thing you could put a cockpit in.

41:58.435 --> 41:59.520
Flying.

42:04.399 --> 42:05.442
Yeah.

42:06.944 --> 42:09.780
We used to be
on the bleeding edge of things, you know?

42:10.948 --> 42:14.034
Go the highest. Fly the fastest.

42:16.370 --> 42:17.496
Pioneers.

42:17.829 --> 42:19.039
That's what we were.

42:23.085 --> 42:25.587
<i>Davy Crockett</i>, <i>Daniel Boone.</i>

42:26.380 --> 42:27.714
You remember those shows?

42:30.551 --> 42:31.844
Same guy played 'em both.

42:32.761 --> 42:34.972
Same coonskin cap and everything.

42:35.806 --> 42:37.307
I never understood that.

42:41.562 --> 42:44.356
Dani could probably explain it.

42:46.024 --> 42:47.067
Yeah.

42:48.318 --> 42:50.487
Davy Crockett, Daniel Boone.

42:52.030 --> 42:53.073
Pioneers.

42:54.783 --> 42:58.203
Going out into the wilderness
and blazing a trail

42:58.287 --> 43:00.664
to where no man has gone before.

43:02.374 --> 43:03.834
That's why I like it out here.

43:05.919 --> 43:07.337
No man's gone here.

43:09.423 --> 43:10.507
No man.

43:12.718 --> 43:13.760
Just me.

43:17.389 --> 43:20.601
But that's not the job anymore.
Not really.

43:21.768 --> 43:23.478
Now it's just homesteading.

43:23.562 --> 43:26.523
Build a cabin, plow the field,
put up fences to keep out the neighbors.

43:26.607 --> 43:29.902
I mean, look around you, Ed,
we're on the edge of the known universe.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.196
The frontier starts right here.

43:32.279 --> 43:35.032
A whole universe just waiting
to be explored, and what are we doing?

43:35.115 --> 43:36.283
Playing house.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.452
That's not what I signed up for.

43:39.161 --> 43:40.787
Not what I signed up for at all.

43:41.330 --> 43:43.081
I get where you're coming from.

43:43.165 --> 43:46.668
I really do, but I don't think
those days are really behind us.

43:46.752 --> 43:49.004
-The hell was that?
-You know, this is the beginning.

43:49.838 --> 43:52.132
-Hey, what--
-I saw one. Holy shit, I saw one.

43:52.216 --> 43:53.884
-What happened? You saw what?
-It's an ant.

43:53.967 --> 43:55.761
-There's an ant in my space suit.
-In your suit?

43:56.595 --> 43:57.763
I can feel him.

43:57.846 --> 43:59.723
He's crawling.
Crawling down the back of my neck.

43:59.806 --> 44:02.142
-Calm down.
-They're all over me.

44:02.226 --> 44:04.478
-Gordo. Calm down.
-They're all over me.

44:04.561 --> 44:06.146
-Just calm down.
-Get it off!

44:06.230 --> 44:07.606
Gotta get my helmet off!

44:07.689 --> 44:08.815
Get it off!

44:12.486 --> 44:14.363
-Gordo, calm down.
-Get it off!

44:14.446 --> 44:16.490
Calm down!

44:19.701 --> 44:21.245
Get it off me, man. Get it off me.

44:21.328 --> 44:24.498
No. Gordo, look at me.
Look at me. Hey, it's me.

44:27.042 --> 44:30.003
They ain't there.
Gordo, everything's gonna be all right.

44:30.087 --> 44:31.296
Just trust me.

44:32.798 --> 44:33.882
Calm down.

44:35.050 --> 44:37.678
It's all right.
Everything's gonna be okay.

44:38.470 --> 44:39.513
It's all right.

44:45.269 --> 44:46.520
I'm sorry, I'm...

44:48.105 --> 44:50.232
I don't know what happened out there.

44:50.315 --> 44:51.483
It's okay.

44:52.860 --> 44:53.986
You're fine now.

44:54.695 --> 44:56.113
What are you gonna do, skipper?

44:58.407 --> 45:00.284
It's the middle of the night in Houston.

45:02.536 --> 45:04.329
And I don't want to talk to Australia.

45:08.208 --> 45:09.501
Wait till the morning.

45:10.335 --> 45:11.587
Put the call through.

45:14.464 --> 45:15.757
What are you gonna tell 'em?

45:24.600 --> 45:25.642
The truth.

45:28.061 --> 45:29.771
We got a medical situation.

45:30.772 --> 45:32.065
We got to power up the lifeboat.

45:33.275 --> 45:34.610
Take Gordo home.

45:34.693 --> 45:35.944
I'll be okay.

45:36.653 --> 45:37.779
No, you won't.

45:38.822 --> 45:41.241
And I should've seen it a long time ago.
But...

45:44.453 --> 45:46.788
You tried to warn me, Dani,
but I didn't listen.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.794
We gotta face it.
I mean, you gotta go home, Gordo.

45:54.421 --> 45:55.631
Shit.

45:57.216 --> 45:58.634
If we abandon this base,

45:58.717 --> 46:01.303
the Russians are gonna be all over it
before we even break orbit.

46:01.386 --> 46:02.846
I'm not gonna abandon the base.

46:05.015 --> 46:06.058
What do you mean?

46:06.808 --> 46:10.270
I'm sending you and Gordo home without me.
I'm staying.

46:12.064 --> 46:13.065
Alone?

46:16.151 --> 46:18.111
I'm naming Dani commander
of the return mission.

46:19.112 --> 46:20.822
You'll fly second seat, Gordo.

46:20.906 --> 46:23.492
Follow her orders. Understood?

46:23.575 --> 46:24.576
Understood.

46:24.660 --> 46:27.204
But if we take the lifeboat,
you got no way home

46:27.287 --> 46:30.499
until Apollo 24 gets its shit together
and brings the next crew.

46:32.835 --> 46:34.253
Houston will never go for it.

46:35.045 --> 46:37.506
They'll never leave an astronaut
marooned on the moon.

46:37.589 --> 46:39.925
I understand all that,
but this is my command,

46:40.008 --> 46:42.970
and I'll decide what happens to it.

46:43.053 --> 46:46.849
I'm not going to abandon this base
or our mining operations to the Russians.

46:47.349 --> 46:51.186
They'd strip Jamestown of every piece of
technology they could get their hands on.

46:51.728 --> 46:55.691
I will stay until properly relieved
by the crew of Apollo 24.

46:55.774 --> 46:57.484
And that's my final decision.

47:02.656 --> 47:04.908
Too tired to argue anymore.

47:37.107 --> 47:38.400
What's gonna happen to him?

47:41.695 --> 47:44.072
Well, they're gonna send him
to the shrinks.

47:44.156 --> 47:45.199
Yeah.

47:47.117 --> 47:48.994
His career's over.

47:49.077 --> 47:50.245
I can tell you that.

47:52.164 --> 47:53.707
They'll never let him fly again.

47:57.085 --> 47:58.962
You mean in space, right?

47:59.713 --> 48:01.006
I mean in anything.

48:01.840 --> 48:03.675
They'll yank his pilot ticket.

48:04.801 --> 48:06.428
Military and civilian.

48:11.975 --> 48:13.143
That'll kill him.

48:18.273 --> 48:19.274
Yeah.

48:47.845 --> 48:48.971
What's going on?

48:49.054 --> 48:50.722
Need a little help here.

48:50.806 --> 48:51.932
What happened?

48:53.100 --> 48:54.184
You okay?

48:58.981 --> 49:00.232
What happened?

49:00.858 --> 49:04.653
I don't know. I was...
trying to change the battery,

49:04.736 --> 49:07.072
and then it fell on my arm.

49:07.906 --> 49:09.449
-Let me see.
-I think it's busted.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.870
-Let me see.
-Wait a minute. Think it's the whole arm.

49:12.953 --> 49:14.913
Had to change a battery
in the middle of the night?

49:14.997 --> 49:16.290
By yourself?

49:17.040 --> 49:18.750
Even on the moon,
those things weigh a ton.

49:20.544 --> 49:22.087
Hell's bells, Dani.

49:23.088 --> 49:26.216
I think you're right.
I think that's busted.

49:26.300 --> 49:28.093
Let me go find the medical kit.

49:36.101 --> 49:38.228
You just suddenly had to
change the battery?

49:38.312 --> 49:39.855
Couldn't wait till morning?

49:39.938 --> 49:43.984
Yeah. That's just exactly what happened.

49:45.861 --> 49:47.821
So you need to call Houston

49:48.322 --> 49:50.407
and let them know
that you have an astronaut

49:50.490 --> 49:54.620
who has had an accident
and needs to go home.

49:58.665 --> 50:00.000
You didn't have to do this.

50:02.753 --> 50:04.213
Clayton's lost, Ed.

50:06.798 --> 50:08.217
And he's not coming back.

50:09.593 --> 50:10.677
I know that.

50:12.346 --> 50:14.014
And if they ground Gordo...

50:15.265 --> 50:17.142
he's not coming back either.

50:19.144 --> 50:20.312
All right.

50:22.147 --> 50:23.899
Let me try and get this around your arm.

50:24.274 --> 50:27.194
Okay. Just... breathe.

50:30.113 --> 50:33.408
Just try to lift it up. There you go.

50:37.246 --> 50:39.748
<i>We've spoken to the Joint Chiefs
as well as the White House,</i>

50:39.831 --> 50:43.710
<i>and they all agree that to abandon
the Jamestown Base to the Soviets</i>

50:43.794 --> 50:46.296
<i>would threaten the vital
national security interests</i>

50:46.380 --> 50:47.881
<i>of the United States.</i>

50:47.965 --> 50:51.051
<i>So, they all support your decision
to remain at Jamestown</i>

50:51.134 --> 50:52.594
<i>until properly relieved,</i>

50:52.678 --> 50:55.180
<i>which should be in two weeks' time.</i>

50:56.098 --> 50:58.183
<i>Over my objections, for the record.</i>

50:58.267 --> 51:00.269
<i>Which were so noted in the record.</i>

51:01.228 --> 51:03.689
<i>The president has also decided
to promote you</i>

51:03.772 --> 51:06.567
<i>to the rank of captain
in the United States Navy.</i>

51:06.650 --> 51:08.485
<i>Backdated to the beginning
of this mission,</i>

51:08.569 --> 51:12.072
<i>with all pay and benefits
retroactive to that time.</i>

51:12.656 --> 51:14.074
<i>Congratulations, Captain.</i>

51:14.157 --> 51:15.242
Thank you, sir.

51:15.868 --> 51:18.161
I'm sure Karen will appreciate
the extra pay.

51:26.795 --> 51:29.798
We're all good in here.
Powered up and ready to burn home.

51:30.424 --> 51:31.466
Copy that.

51:34.303 --> 51:35.929
I guess this it, huh?

51:40.184 --> 51:43.437
Well, Godspeed and all that.

51:43.854 --> 51:44.855
Yeah.

51:46.732 --> 51:47.900
It won't be long.

51:49.109 --> 51:53.363
We'll kick some ass back there,
get those clowns on 24 moving.

51:53.447 --> 51:54.948
Probably be here in...

51:56.325 --> 51:58.035
In about two weeks.

51:59.453 --> 52:00.454
BOHICA.

52:02.831 --> 52:05.125
-BOHICA.
-All right, I give up.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.503
I've been pretending
I knew what that meant for months.

52:07.920 --> 52:09.421
Enough already. What does BOHICA mean?

52:09.505 --> 52:11.131
Just an old navy saying.

52:12.841 --> 52:15.219
-"Bend over..."
-"Here it comes again."

52:18.055 --> 52:19.181
BOHICA.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.641
BOHICA.

52:22.684 --> 52:25.020
Well, okay.

52:28.023 --> 52:29.066
Bye, Bob.

52:29.983 --> 52:30.984
Bye, Bob.

52:33.195 --> 52:34.196
Bye, Bob.

53:08.397 --> 53:09.731
Setting up for the burn.

53:10.691 --> 53:12.401
Everything's on track here, Houston.

53:13.694 --> 53:15.070
<i>Roger that, </i>Excalibur<i>.</i>

53:24.746 --> 53:25.789
Hey, Dani?

53:27.374 --> 53:28.458
Yeah, Gordo?

53:31.336 --> 53:32.337
Thank you.

53:56.862 --> 53:57.905
Hi, Bob.

54:25.182 --> 54:27.476
I cannot believe that you did this.

54:28.101 --> 54:29.603
After everything that's going on!

54:29.686 --> 54:32.272
-I'm sorry, okay?
-Don't take that tone with me.

54:34.107 --> 54:37.486
Your father is doing one of the bravest
things any man has ever done.

54:37.903 --> 54:40.155
He's alone on the moon.
And what are you doing?

54:40.239 --> 54:42.115
-Stealing?
-It was just some baseball cards!

54:42.199 --> 54:43.700
Doesn't matter what it is.

54:44.159 --> 54:45.536
It's still stealing.

54:49.540 --> 54:51.041
You know,
you're lucky I know Mr. Driscoll,

54:51.124 --> 54:53.502
because if he had called the police,
do you know what would've happened?

54:53.585 --> 54:54.628
Yeah.

54:54.711 --> 54:56.421
Don't you "yeah" me.

54:57.256 --> 54:58.257
Yes, ma'am.

54:58.340 --> 55:00.425
You go to your room,
and you do your homework.

55:00.509 --> 55:02.594
You're grounded until after Christmas.

55:04.263 --> 55:06.557
-But I have a basketball game.
-Not anymore.

55:09.268 --> 55:11.270
But Dad's always saying
I can't let the team down.

55:11.353 --> 55:12.479
Dad's not here.

55:13.647 --> 55:16.400
But I have to go!
I can't let the team down!

55:16.483 --> 55:18.777
No, Shane, you're not going
to your basketball game.

55:18.861 --> 55:20.112
That's enough!

55:21.864 --> 55:23.490
This is a bunch of crap!

55:27.786 --> 55:31.248
You go to your room and you don't come out
until I get home from the PTA meeting.

57:44.756 --> 57:45.757
Jesus.

58:00.105 --> 58:02.983
-Hi, can I help you?
-Ma'am, is this your house?

58:03.066 --> 58:04.860
Yes, I'm Karen Baldwin. What's going on?

58:05.444 --> 58:06.528
Is your son Shane Baldwin?

58:08.030 --> 58:10.115
Yes. What's he done?
