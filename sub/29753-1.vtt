WEBVTT

00:12.279 --> 00:15.414
(light sitar music)

00:20.154 --> 00:23.055
(peacock crying)

00:49.583 --> 00:53.585
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:37.398 --> 01:42.534
(water bubbling)
(singing in foreign language)

01:51.579 --> 01:53.145
(gasping)

01:53.147 --> 01:56.248
(breathing heavily)

02:24.211 --> 02:25.210
- Sure.

02:32.786 --> 02:37.923
(all clapping)
(light orchestral music)

02:41.762 --> 02:45.764
(singing in foreign language)

03:34.982 --> 03:39.251
- Going halfway, that's
farther than yesterday.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.793
(singing in foreign language)

03:47.795 --> 03:49.228
(grunting)

03:49.230 --> 03:51.697
Oh yeah that's fast, so fast.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.733
All right so move
forward, right there.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.567
Yeah.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.535
Superman!

03:58.239 --> 04:00.405
Wanna relax, like I showed you?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.540
Like your mom did?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.475
Open your legs, open your legs.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.943
Oh no, not like that.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.311
- Careful guys.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.247
- Relax, there we go.

04:10.517 --> 04:14.620
(singing in foreign language)

04:18.524 --> 04:19.992
- You could climb up,

04:19.994 --> 04:23.428
but Princess Nora
didn't know how to climb

04:23.430 --> 04:27.966
so she got the chair, she
pulled it close to the cupboard.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.970
(singing in foreign language)

04:38.512 --> 04:41.747
- She climbed on the
chair and tried to reach

04:41.749 --> 04:46.285
to the little door where
the chocolate was kept.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.637
But then--

04:48.638 --> 04:50.988
(singing in foreign language)

05:16.750 --> 05:17.616
- Mmm!

05:17.618 --> 05:18.617
Spicy!

05:21.588 --> 05:26.725
¶ At night, when
dreams grow tall ¶

05:27.728 --> 05:29.861
¶ In that land without
the usual laws ¶

05:29.863 --> 05:33.732
¶ I'll fall without moving ¶

05:33.734 --> 05:37.869
¶ I'll fly without wings ¶

05:37.871 --> 05:43.008
¶ With a truth, free
to change its shape ¶

05:46.347 --> 05:49.614
¶ I wake up every morning
to the music of my dreams ¶

05:49.616 --> 05:54.453
¶ Seeping into a
new day's light ¶

05:54.455 --> 05:58.457
(singing in foreign language)

06:25.719 --> 06:26.718
- Thanks.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.413
- She's abandoned in a forest,

06:54.415 --> 06:56.481
pregnant and vulnerable.

06:56.483 --> 06:59.584
That is not something you
do to the love of your life.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.186
She trusted Rama.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.555
(light orchestral music)

07:03.557 --> 07:06.892
- [Valli] She thinks it's
just a pleasure trip.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.460
- Imagine her agony

07:08.462 --> 07:11.630
when she finds out what
was about to happen!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.032
No wonder she throws
herself into the Ganga!

07:14.034 --> 07:15.834
- [Valli] But
Ganga protects her.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.803
Her children are
born in the river.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.471
- Lava and Kusha.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.173
Twin boys.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.142
- [Sabapathy] Marvelous!

07:24.143 --> 07:25.709
- [Parvathi] What's
so marvelous about it?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.612
- [Sabapathy] The
imagination of the writer.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.448
- [Parvathi] Then, he
should have imagined a story

07:29.450 --> 07:30.849
where Sita is treated better.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.983
- [Valli] A woman
would have written

07:31.985 --> 07:33.552
the Ramayana differently.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.120
- The audience will
not accept that.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.589
- Don't you see the irony of it?

07:37.591 --> 07:39.925
Rama exiled Sita to
satisfy his people

07:39.927 --> 07:42.060
and you want to
give our audience

07:42.062 --> 07:44.863
what you think they want?

07:44.865 --> 07:46.198
- The Ramayana works.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.699
Just stick with it!

07:47.701 --> 07:49.901
Where is the need
to get creative?

07:49.903 --> 07:53.805
- Rama had Sita pass through
the fire to test her purity.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.475
Where do we stand
with this story?

07:56.477 --> 07:59.611
We'll worry about
our audience later.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.248
- Hmmm?

08:03.249 --> 08:05.583
- [Valli] There's
someone at the back gate.

08:27.174 --> 08:31.176
(light acoustic guitar music)

08:42.688 --> 08:46.024
The main entrance is
on the other side.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.593
- It used to be on this side.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.862
I came through the forest.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.536
May I come in?

08:58.238 --> 08:59.538
- Of course.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.644
It would be easier
if you open the gate.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.580
- Hi.

09:10.551 --> 09:14.819
(light acoustic guitar music)

09:14.821 --> 09:18.957
- [Valli] I think you can
let go of my hand now.

09:29.636 --> 09:32.771
(light flute music)

09:35.776 --> 09:39.311
- What is it to belong
to Sita's Universe?

09:39.313 --> 09:40.812
Every dancer in our play

09:40.814 --> 09:43.982
must find an answer
to that question.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.288
Skanda?

09:52.125 --> 09:54.859
- [Kris] I am looking
for my father, Jon.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.963
- Skanda, you
don't recognize me?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.865
- [Kris] Where is my father?

10:00.867 --> 10:02.033
- You've grown so much!

10:02.035 --> 10:04.319
- Please.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.604
Will you tell me
where my father is?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.714
- Jon is not here.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.117
But he will return.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.956
- When?

10:28.895 --> 10:32.230
- Your father disappears
often, days on end.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.898
But he will return.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.000
Please stay.

10:38.238 --> 10:41.072
- Do you really want me to stay?

10:43.810 --> 10:46.177
- Skanda, this is your home.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.382
- [Valli] Kris.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.119
- Valli.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.124
- Valli, take him to Jon's room.

11:01.695 --> 11:05.096
- Would you like to
look around first?

11:05.098 --> 11:06.364
- [Kris] Sure.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.068
- You could leave your bag here.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.344
- I hope Jon comes back soon.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.812
- Yes.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.148
I wish he was already here.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.819
- We sell more tickets
when Jon's here.

11:28.822 --> 11:32.223
- Is that all you ever
think of, Sabapathi?

12:50.070 --> 12:52.337
- [Valli] That is Kausalya.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.305
Rama's mother.

12:54.307 --> 12:58.176
Pining for Sita,
her daughter-in-law.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.178
- [Kris] Rama's mother?

13:01.181 --> 13:05.283
- [Valli] She loved Sita
like her own daughter.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.118
- That is Janaka.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.386
Sita's father.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.290
Sad, and angry,
at the same time.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.073
- [Kris] Love the way it sounds!

14:02.075 --> 14:04.125
- Yes.

14:04.126 --> 14:06.176
Sanskrit is the
language of the Gods

14:57.631 --> 14:59.597
- What's the story?

14:59.599 --> 15:02.433
- It is the last
episode in the Ramayana.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.902
Remember?

15:03.904 --> 15:05.587
- Yeah.

15:05.588 --> 15:07.271
What's so special
about the last episode?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.908
- It is where Lava
meets his father.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.260
- Rama?

15:12.261 --> 15:14.611
- Yes, for the first
time since his birth.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.315
- How old is he?

15:17.317 --> 15:18.516
- [Valli] 12.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.084
(whistling)

15:20.086 --> 15:23.321
- Did his father send him away?

15:23.323 --> 15:25.323
- Something like that.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.927
- It's beginning to sound
a lot like my own story.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.195
(hissing)

15:34.067 --> 15:36.234
I have lost the habit.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.102
- It will come back.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.074
(bell ringing)

15:49.549 --> 15:51.015
This is Shiva.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.617
Parvathi

15:53.353 --> 15:54.452
and Skanda.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.387
- Skanda?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.289
- Yes.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.994
They have been here
for a few years now.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.138
- What happened to the house?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.308
- Termites!

16:17.310 --> 16:19.978
It was eaten from the inside.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.414
Jon was hardly ever there.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.416
It had to be re-built.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.522
- It's still here?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.025
- Yes.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.393
I drive it now.

16:44.270 --> 16:47.372
(car horn honking)

16:57.283 --> 17:00.351
(children laughing)

17:04.691 --> 17:06.290
- [Nagarajan] Look
at these kids!

17:06.291 --> 17:09.359
- They will play here
all the day long?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.762
- I did that too as a child.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.233
- Clay is good for the skin.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.666
- I'm sure it is.

17:16.669 --> 17:17.667
- Really?

17:19.271 --> 17:21.472
- [Nagarajan] The water
is warm on the surface

17:21.473 --> 17:23.473
and cool under it.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.576
We should join them some time.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.211
- How about now?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.311
- We could leave you here

17:28.314 --> 17:29.714
and pick you up on the way home.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.182
- Come on, it wouldn't be as fun

17:31.184 --> 17:33.317
without you and the kids!

17:33.319 --> 17:36.621
- Dad, can we build
a mud pool at home?

17:38.691 --> 17:39.590
- Sure, Kris.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.075
- [Valli] Yay!

17:41.076 --> 17:42.559
I would love that, Jon.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.066
(children laughing)

17:58.478 --> 18:00.611
- How did you meet Jon?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.213
- We met in Benares,

18:02.215 --> 18:04.282
on the Ghats of the river Ganga.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.085
My first trip to
India, with my parents.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.486
- Love at first sight?

18:08.488 --> 18:10.004
- Pretty much!

18:10.005 --> 18:11.521
I think the way he
told me the story

18:11.524 --> 18:14.392
of the Ganga, that
did it for me.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.561
- That's a beautiful story!

18:16.563 --> 18:18.629
- My parents went into
shock when I told them

18:18.631 --> 18:20.364
I want to marry him

18:20.366 --> 18:23.201
after being with him just a day.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.735
- You got married at Benares?

18:24.737 --> 18:27.305
- No, we never got married.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.573
- Of course, you did!

18:28.575 --> 18:31.309
We call it the Gandharva vivaha.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.343
- Gandhar what?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.211
(laughing)

18:33.213 --> 18:35.347
- Gandharva.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.482
That's when our
parents don't agree.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.756
(Kris screaming)

18:45.758 --> 18:49.660
- They will have to
accept Jon some day.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.396
He makes a great father!

18:52.398 --> 18:53.764
- Yes, he does.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.235
A father who can't say no.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.570
(chuckling)

19:00.673 --> 19:04.375
(Indian classical music)

19:05.678 --> 19:09.680
(singing in foreign language)

19:48.888 --> 19:51.455
(clapping)

20:00.200 --> 20:03.301
(light bell music)

21:04.797 --> 21:07.331
(laughing)

21:09.836 --> 21:10.801
- Nice!

21:10.803 --> 21:11.802
Thank you.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.274
- Hey.

21:18.544 --> 21:19.543
Bed time?

21:19.545 --> 21:21.345
- [Parvathi] Come.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.847
- [Jon] Say good night to Mamma.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.048
You guys have fun playing?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.349
- [Kris] Yeah.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.351
- [Jon] Let's go.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.352
(light sitar music)

21:49.042 --> 21:50.675
- What does it mean?

21:50.677 --> 21:52.677
- She is telling her lover

21:52.679 --> 21:55.646
paint a leaf design
on my breasts.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.762
- Put color on my cheeks.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.799
Lay a girdle on my hips.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.885
- Twine my heavy
braid with flowers.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.658
Fix a row of
bangles in my hands.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.502
- And jeweled anklets on my feet

22:51.504 --> 22:55.473
(singing in foreign language)

22:57.009 --> 22:58.442
- She is good!

22:59.011 --> 23:00.878
- My mother is Indian, you know.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.746
- Really?

23:01.748 --> 23:02.614
- Yes.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.481
- And your father?

23:05.818 --> 23:06.817
- Austrian.

23:06.818 --> 23:07.817
- Such a lovely combination!

23:07.820 --> 23:08.753
- Yes, it is, no?

23:08.755 --> 23:11.155
(chuckling)

23:31.077 --> 23:35.079
(singing in foreign language)

23:58.938 --> 24:02.907
(light acoustic guitar music)

24:07.480 --> 24:10.614
(children laughing)

24:24.130 --> 24:28.132
(singing in foreign language)

24:41.147 --> 24:42.546
- That's him?

24:44.517 --> 24:46.050
- That's not Appa.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.054
- I see him like that.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.055
- How?

24:51.057 --> 24:55.493
- With my imagination,
I make him my own.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.596
- Can you teach me?

24:58.598 --> 25:00.164
- Sure, Skanda.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.165
It's easy.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.269
But the imagination
is all yours.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.708
- He looks so different, Amma.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.679
- I like it!

25:17.283 --> 25:20.017
- Come, let me tie your dhoti.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.767
- Come.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.901
- I get a better view now!

25:56.689 --> 26:00.624
(singing in foreign language)

26:14.607 --> 26:18.609
(singing in foreign language)

26:28.621 --> 26:33.757
(singing in foreign language)
(light sitar music)

27:43.329 --> 27:45.195
- That's Jon's room.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.777
- [Kris] That portrait?

28:00.680 --> 28:01.712
- It's Jon.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.684
- [Kris] Yeah!

28:18.698 --> 28:22.700
(singing in foreign language)

29:14.019 --> 29:17.154
(light sitar music)

31:19.578 --> 31:20.577
You dance?

31:22.248 --> 31:23.247
- Yes.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.552
- You look familiar.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.187
Who are you?

31:30.189 --> 31:31.188
- Kris.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.091
- Kris?

31:36.095 --> 31:39.563
I could have guessed by
that mole on your cheek!

31:39.565 --> 31:41.899
How you have grown!

31:41.901 --> 31:42.933
Kris, wait!

31:51.110 --> 31:52.309
Welcome home.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.145
- [Kris] You were playing Rama.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.613
- Yes.

31:56.615 --> 32:00.150
- Were you just
pretending to miss Sita?

32:06.058 --> 32:08.458
- He looks so much like Jon.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.229
- I tried talking to him.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.432
But he is not the Kris I know.

32:15.434 --> 32:20.337
- [Parvathi] Who knows how
he has lived all these years?

32:20.339 --> 32:24.408
- [Nagarajan] His mother
cut us off completely.

32:26.278 --> 32:30.113
- I somehow feel
responsible for everything.

32:30.115 --> 32:34.117
(light acoustic guitar music)

32:35.654 --> 32:37.254
- [Jon] What's for dinner?

32:37.256 --> 32:38.722
- Chickpea salad.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.461
- [Jon] Mmm, Sundal.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.714
- Parvathi, they are not going

33:37.715 --> 33:39.181
to have any appetite
for my salad now.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.718
- It is an offering
from the Ganesha temple.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.120
It's delicious!

33:43.122 --> 33:45.789
- [Valli] It's very tasty, Amma.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.028
- Clara.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.264
(door slamming)

33:54.266 --> 33:56.033
- I have upset her.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.647
- Kris, I got a new song for you

34:10.649 --> 34:11.514
- Yeah?

34:11.516 --> 34:12.783
Show me.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.051
- It is simple.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.387
You see.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.722
(light acoustic guitar music)

34:25.364 --> 34:28.130
¶ You are to me ¶

34:28.132 --> 34:32.168
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

34:32.170 --> 34:35.539
¶ To find you near ¶

34:35.541 --> 34:38.775
¶ I close my eyes ¶

34:38.777 --> 34:39.775
Wanna try?

34:42.114 --> 34:45.614
¶ You are to me ¶

34:45.617 --> 34:50.286
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

34:50.289 --> 34:53.857
¶ To find you near ¶

34:53.859 --> 34:56.760
¶ I close my eyes ¶

34:56.762 --> 34:58.495
- Try Valli.

34:58.497 --> 35:02.432
¶ You are to me ¶

35:02.434 --> 35:07.270
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

35:07.272 --> 35:11.374
¶ To find you near ¶

35:11.376 --> 35:16.246
¶ I close my eyes ¶

35:16.248 --> 35:20.250
¶ And you are to me ¶

35:20.252 --> 35:23.386
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

35:24.256 --> 35:26.456
- Here we go.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.657
¶ To find you near ¶

35:28.660 --> 35:33.430
¶ I close my eyes ¶

35:33.432 --> 35:37.334
¶ A ball of thread
rolling on and on ¶

35:37.336 --> 35:41.805
¶ Connected from
beginning to end ¶

35:41.807 --> 35:45.575
¶ Never together
yet never apart ¶

35:45.577 --> 35:48.645
¶ It's my longing
that keeps me alive ¶

35:48.647 --> 35:53.783
¶ Like there's no tomorrow ¶

35:54.353 --> 35:55.819
¶ Tomorrow ¶

35:55.821 --> 35:56.686
Everybody!

35:56.688 --> 35:58.555
The beginning.

35:58.557 --> 36:02.359
¶ And you are to me ¶

36:02.361 --> 36:06.796
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

36:06.798 --> 36:10.734
¶ To find you near ¶

36:10.736 --> 36:15.405
¶ I close my eyes ¶

36:15.407 --> 36:19.376
¶ And you are to me ¶

36:19.378 --> 36:24.247
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

36:24.249 --> 36:27.951
¶ To find you near ¶

36:27.953 --> 36:32.756
¶ I close my eyes ¶

36:32.758 --> 36:37.194
¶ And you are to me ¶

36:37.196 --> 36:40.463
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

36:40.465 --> 36:42.999
- Everybody!

36:43.000 --> 36:45.534
¶ To find you near ¶

36:45.537 --> 36:47.370
¶ I close ¶

36:47.372 --> 36:49.739
(laughing)

36:50.876 --> 36:52.576
- And compassion.

36:53.912 --> 36:58.515
Please.
(speaking foreign language)

36:59.818 --> 37:01.785
- [Kris] Anger.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.920
- [Parvathi] Yes, anger.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.625
- Courage.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.759
Nice, Valli!

37:12.431 --> 37:13.964
- [Parvathi] Fear.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.300
Something you are afraid of.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.703
- Disgust!

37:21.540 --> 37:23.773
That bad smell and taste.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.777
- Astonishment, wonder!

37:28.814 --> 37:31.481
(speaking foreign language)

37:31.483 --> 37:32.616
It is peace.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.553
The balance of all the emotions.

37:38.857 --> 37:42.792
(speaking foreign language)

37:43.762 --> 37:44.694
- What is that again, Valli?

37:44.696 --> 37:46.563
- [Both] Compassion.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.569
(speaking foreign language)

37:52.571 --> 37:53.637
- Laughter.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.775
(laughing)

37:59.978 --> 38:03.947
(speaking foreign language)

38:17.496 --> 38:18.528
- Astonishment.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.896
Marvelous.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.765
- Kris, Valli, come.

38:23.568 --> 38:25.502
Time for your lesson.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.839
- Mom, can we practice
a bit more time?

38:32.778 --> 38:34.978
- Clara, we are done now.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.481
- [Clara] Come.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.482
- Go on.

38:58.470 --> 39:01.871
- These wind turbines
are built on high ridges,

39:01.873 --> 39:04.607
on the sea coast,
or open plains.

39:04.609 --> 39:07.110
That is because
there's a lot of space

39:07.112 --> 39:09.079
and much wind can come.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.380
- [Valli] Can't
we build one here?

39:10.382 --> 39:11.581
(laughing)

39:11.583 --> 39:13.116
- It'll be a little
bit expensive

39:13.118 --> 39:14.317
to do that.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.517
And it's huge, they are huge!

39:15.520 --> 39:16.886
They are most productive

39:16.888 --> 39:19.089
if there are many together.

39:19.091 --> 39:22.726
You see this little
small ladder here.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.761
Imagine a human being here.

39:24.763 --> 39:25.995
It's so huge!

39:25.997 --> 39:29.099
- [Valli] And it takes
a long time to climb it.

39:29.101 --> 39:30.834
- Very long time to climb.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.803
And it's much bigger than
the trees we have here.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.705
So, sometimes they go up here

39:35.707 --> 39:38.408
to actually clean or repair it.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.043
- Who wants to go to the beach?

39:40.045 --> 39:41.511
- [Both] Yeah!

39:43.148 --> 39:45.115
- Mom!

39:45.116 --> 39:47.083
We can study the
wind at the beach.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.653
- Okay, go on and change.

39:50.655 --> 39:51.721
- Come on

39:51.722 --> 39:52.788
- [Valli] Meet you at the gate!

39:52.791 --> 39:54.090
- Come with us.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.860
- [Kris] Yes mom, come with us!

39:56.862 --> 39:57.861
- Okay.

40:19.418 --> 40:22.118
(waves crashing)

40:52.717 --> 40:55.685
- [Nagarajan] Let
it go, Parvathi.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.925
- I know why my mother
chose you, for me.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.626
- Why?

41:03.628 --> 41:06.162
- Because she knew, I
would always love you,

41:06.164 --> 41:08.565
like she loved my father.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.835
- I think it is the
other way around.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.470
She knew

41:13.472 --> 41:15.839
I would always be with you.

41:23.148 --> 41:26.549
You think your father
is still alive?

41:27.752 --> 41:31.120
- That's what my mother
believed, till the very end.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.756
I choose to believe the same.

41:36.495 --> 41:39.896
- He wouldn't have let her
die, if he had been here.

41:39.898 --> 41:40.897
- Yes.

41:41.967 --> 41:44.067
She missed him a lot.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.735
Absence can kill.

41:52.777 --> 41:56.613
The only image I have
of him, is a picture.

41:56.615 --> 42:00.049
Sometimes, I will
his image to move

42:00.051 --> 42:02.652
and to say something to me.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.653
He speaks.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.123
I cannot hear his voice.

42:08.260 --> 42:10.293
All this for a father

42:10.295 --> 42:13.630
I haven't actually
known in my life.

42:14.633 --> 42:18.067
How much more terrible
it must be for Kris?

42:18.069 --> 42:20.203
I hope Jon returns soon.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.673
- I hope so too!

42:40.625 --> 42:43.693
(percussive music)

42:59.578 --> 43:01.344
- Lava is Rama's son!

43:03.048 --> 43:04.614
He has been blessed
with the power

43:04.616 --> 43:07.884
to invoke celestial
weapons at will.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.853
Play it with a
little more gusto!

43:10.855 --> 43:13.957
Look at how she's
playing Chandraketu!

43:13.959 --> 43:16.125
Try to match that energy.

43:20.865 --> 43:23.933
(percussive music)

43:31.743 --> 43:34.143
Vishwa, it's four, not five!

43:39.017 --> 43:40.650
Kris, you do it!

44:07.312 --> 44:10.380
(percussive music)

45:50.415 --> 45:51.781
- Nice, Kris!

45:53.184 --> 45:54.317
- Thank you.

45:57.989 --> 46:00.056
- That's how it is done.

46:08.199 --> 46:09.999
- [Valli] You did
a good job, Kris.

46:10.001 --> 46:11.400
- Valli, Skanda,

46:12.904 --> 46:14.504
come, walk with me.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.851
Lovely evening, isn't it?

46:29.554 --> 46:30.953
- Yes, it is.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.959
- I would like to
tell you a story

46:36.961 --> 46:38.561
about my parents,

46:38.563 --> 46:40.897
about your grandparents.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.966
A long time ago,

46:43.968 --> 46:47.870
when my mother Kannamma
was about your age,

46:47.872 --> 46:51.073
there was a terrible
drought in this village.

46:51.075 --> 46:54.210
Her teacher taught
her a composition

46:54.212 --> 46:57.480
imbued with the power
to make it rain.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.450
She prayed to the
Goddess Annapurna

47:01.452 --> 47:03.186
for her blessings.

47:04.222 --> 47:06.122
And the rain that
followed her dance

47:06.124 --> 47:08.558
made Kannamma famous.

47:08.560 --> 47:10.459
- Do you know the
composition, Amma?

47:10.461 --> 47:12.395
- Yes Valli, I do.

47:12.397 --> 47:15.031
I'll teach it to you some day.

47:15.033 --> 47:18.234
- I'd love to be
able to make it rain.

47:18.236 --> 47:19.402
- It's so cool.

47:19.404 --> 47:20.970
I'd like to learn it too.

47:20.972 --> 47:23.573
- I'll teach you both then.

47:23.575 --> 47:25.308
Now, for my story.

47:26.311 --> 47:29.212
Kannamma made a
vow to the Goddess

47:29.214 --> 47:31.848
to thank her for the rain.

47:31.850 --> 47:35.484
She would dance at her
temple, at Devaprayag.

47:35.486 --> 47:37.420
- Where's Devaprayag?

47:38.389 --> 47:40.389
- It is where
river Ganga begins,

47:40.391 --> 47:43.125
up there in the Himalayas.

47:43.127 --> 47:45.528
But she never made it there.

47:47.432 --> 47:49.031
- What happened?

47:52.170 --> 47:56.305
- Your grandfather was
with her on that journey.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.574
They reached Haridwar,

47:58.576 --> 48:01.644
100 kilometers
short of Devaprayag.

48:03.081 --> 48:05.281
He left her there
by the river bank

48:05.283 --> 48:07.350
to attend to a sick man

48:08.219 --> 48:10.019
and never returned.

48:11.222 --> 48:13.155
- He was doctor, wasn't he?

48:13.157 --> 48:14.156
- Yes.

48:15.293 --> 48:18.127
My mother was
pregnant with me then.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.929
But she didn't know it.

48:19.931 --> 48:21.297
Neither did he.

48:23.935 --> 48:26.269
- What could have happened?

48:27.205 --> 48:29.572
- Kannamma waited in Haridwar

48:29.574 --> 48:33.109
until she found out
she was pregnant.

48:33.111 --> 48:36.646
There was an epidemic of
Tuberculosis in that area

48:36.648 --> 48:41.250
and she didn't want to
get infected for my sake.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.519
And so, she returned home.

48:44.589 --> 48:47.123
- Did she go to Devaprayag?

48:47.125 --> 48:49.025
- No.

48:49.026 --> 48:50.926
How could she in that state?

48:50.929 --> 48:52.595
She returned home.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.330
- What about Dada?

48:56.467 --> 48:59.201
- Kannamma heard about a doctor

48:59.203 --> 49:01.637
working high up
in the mountains,

49:01.639 --> 49:03.940
trying to save a whole village

49:03.942 --> 49:06.342
affected by the disease.

49:06.344 --> 49:08.945
She believed it was him.

49:08.947 --> 49:11.948
She believed he would
come back to her

49:11.950 --> 49:13.649
once it was all over.

49:15.353 --> 49:16.953
- But he didn't.

49:19.724 --> 49:20.723
- No.

49:24.529 --> 49:28.030
Perhaps, he would
not have left her

49:28.032 --> 49:30.566
had he known she was pregnant.

49:48.753 --> 49:52.755
I know what it is to
grow up without a father.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.996
What made you come back?

50:03.134 --> 50:06.402
- Every night, for
the past few months

50:07.372 --> 50:10.139
I've been having this dream.

50:10.141 --> 50:12.108
In it, I am swimming,

50:13.578 --> 50:16.312
trying to reach my father.

50:16.314 --> 50:18.080
He's standing in the water,

50:18.082 --> 50:19.348
singing to me.

50:21.285 --> 50:24.420
But before I can
reach him, I drown.

50:27.225 --> 50:29.158
I wake up breathless.

50:31.696 --> 50:35.031
It's impossible to
sleep after that.

50:44.308 --> 50:46.642
Do we have to be cast in stone

50:46.644 --> 50:49.078
to keep smiling like that?

50:54.185 --> 50:57.286
(light piano music)

51:30.188 --> 51:31.620
We were so small!

51:45.336 --> 51:46.836
Your grandparents?

51:49.740 --> 51:53.642
- I feel strange looking
at this picture now.

51:54.412 --> 51:55.377
- Why?

51:56.714 --> 51:59.615
- It's only now I
know their story.

51:59.617 --> 52:02.651
Amma kept it from
me all these years.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.754
- I think she shared
it to help me.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.756
It's a deep pain.

52:07.758 --> 52:09.792
She didn't want you
to carry it as well.

52:09.794 --> 52:10.793
- I know.

52:15.266 --> 52:19.268
But I wonder how many
other secrets she keeps!

52:31.249 --> 52:33.582
- There's something
I haven't told you.

52:33.584 --> 52:34.583
- What?

52:36.654 --> 52:39.321
- I was afraid to dance
with you the other day.

52:39.323 --> 52:40.656
- Afraid?

52:40.658 --> 52:41.657
Why?

52:43.461 --> 52:44.527
- I freeze.

52:46.397 --> 52:51.534
Sometimes, it's as if my feet
get nailed to the ground.

52:52.203 --> 52:53.469
- What do you do?

52:53.471 --> 52:55.738
- It gets worse if I struggle.

52:55.740 --> 52:58.207
So, I try to do nothing.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.609
- And yet you danced with me.

53:02.380 --> 53:03.646
You are brave!

53:04.815 --> 53:07.416
- I just felt safe with you.

53:21.332 --> 53:23.465
- [Valli] It's a
strange coincidence.

53:23.467 --> 53:24.800
- What is?

53:24.802 --> 53:27.469
- You are returning
after 12 years.

53:27.471 --> 53:28.604
- [Kris] So?

53:28.606 --> 53:30.472
- That was Lava's age

53:30.474 --> 53:31.774
when he meets Rama

53:31.776 --> 53:34.376
for the very first time.

53:34.378 --> 53:37.446
- A father he'd
never seen before.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.782
- [Valli] But you know Jon.

53:42.687 --> 53:43.786
- Do I?

53:43.787 --> 53:44.886
He must have changed too.

53:53.798 --> 53:58.500
Sometimes I wonder about
Parvathi Akka and my father.

53:59.470 --> 54:01.570
- What do you mean?

54:01.572 --> 54:05.808
- I wonder if she's the
reason he decided to stay.

54:05.810 --> 54:08.344
- She cannot be the only reason.

54:08.346 --> 54:11.247
My father is like
a brother to him.

54:11.249 --> 54:12.915
- And Parvathi Akka?

54:24.662 --> 54:26.395
- [Valli] Go, yay!

54:30.601 --> 54:32.935
(laughing)

54:45.416 --> 54:47.283
- [Kris] Whoo!

54:47.285 --> 54:49.485
- So what did you guys
learn today in class?

54:49.487 --> 54:50.886
- We learned the
nine sentiments.

54:50.888 --> 54:51.754
- [Clara] Food!

54:51.756 --> 54:52.755
Ready.

54:53.724 --> 54:54.723
- Oooh.

54:56.027 --> 54:57.293
- Clara?

54:57.295 --> 54:57.960
- Yes, please.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.595
Thank you.

54:59.597 --> 55:00.696
- Valli.

55:00.698 --> 55:01.697
- Thank you.

55:01.699 --> 55:02.564
- A little more?

55:02.566 --> 55:03.432
- No.

55:03.434 --> 55:04.300
- Okay.

55:04.302 --> 55:05.501
Kris.

55:05.503 --> 55:06.769
A little more?

55:09.440 --> 55:10.572
Oops.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.007
- No, no, no.

55:12.009 --> 55:14.710
We don't eat noodles by hand.

55:15.513 --> 55:17.579
Come, I'll show you.

55:17.581 --> 55:19.848
Take the fork in your right hand

55:19.850 --> 55:22.584
and the spoon in your left.

55:22.586 --> 55:24.620
You take some on your fork.

55:24.622 --> 55:27.656
Yeah, and then you
roll it around.

55:27.658 --> 55:30.659
It is like dancing
with the noodle.

55:30.661 --> 55:33.996
Yeah, and then you
can eat them so nice

55:35.733 --> 55:38.467
without getting dirty fingers.

55:39.437 --> 55:40.436
- Tasty!

55:43.074 --> 55:44.073
Mmm.

55:44.975 --> 55:45.974
Yummy!

55:51.349 --> 55:53.382
- I'll make some more.

55:53.383 --> 55:55.416
I think it's not
going to be enough.

55:56.454 --> 55:58.987
(kids laughing)

55:58.989 --> 56:00.622
Jon!

56:00.624 --> 56:02.591
This is not funny!

56:02.593 --> 56:05.394
You are setting a bad example!

56:05.396 --> 56:06.395
- Sorry.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.072
(Jon humming)

56:38.763 --> 56:39.762
(kids laughing)

56:42.166 --> 56:43.582
- Jon, stop it!

56:43.583 --> 56:44.999
They need to learn
how to eat properly.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.435
- [Jon] Come on Clara,
it's not such a big deal.

56:46.437 --> 56:47.770
- It is for me!

57:14.565 --> 57:16.965
- Clara has become very strict.

57:16.967 --> 57:18.467
- Yeah.

57:18.469 --> 57:20.836
She's being so hard on Dad.

57:26.110 --> 57:28.510
- Jon is silly sometimes.

57:29.847 --> 57:32.448
- He likes to make us laugh.

57:44.762 --> 57:47.162
- It's hard to see them fight.

57:47.164 --> 57:48.163
- Yes.

57:48.999 --> 57:50.599
It makes me sad.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.903
- I am here for you, Kris.

57:56.807 --> 57:59.875
(light piano music)

58:20.698 --> 58:23.232
(Jon humming)

58:31.775 --> 58:34.743
- Honey, do we
have any biscuits?

58:41.051 --> 58:43.519
(humming)

58:53.898 --> 58:56.598
Why are they coming
after so long?

58:56.600 --> 58:57.666
- They want to
meet their grandson

58:57.668 --> 58:59.768
before they get too old.

59:10.814 --> 59:13.081
(sighing)

59:15.553 --> 59:16.785
- Why are you so stressed?

59:16.787 --> 59:18.253
Just be yourself.

59:18.255 --> 59:19.955
You are a grown woman.

59:19.957 --> 59:21.023
They'll just have
to learn to respect

59:21.025 --> 59:22.758
the choices you've made.

59:22.760 --> 59:25.227
- They still have to get
over my choice of you.

59:25.229 --> 59:26.562
Please be nice to them.

59:26.563 --> 59:27.896
It's not going to
be easy for them

59:27.897 --> 59:29.230
to see what you
put us all through.

59:29.233 --> 59:30.232
- What?

59:30.234 --> 59:32.301
Hey, that's not fair!

59:32.303 --> 59:34.836
When have I forced
you into anything?

59:34.838 --> 59:36.672
- I just want to
get away from here.

59:36.674 --> 59:38.707
You're always around Parvathi.

59:38.709 --> 59:40.175
I wonder sometimes if it's only

59:40.177 --> 59:43.011
about music between you both!

59:43.013 --> 59:44.713
You never want to go anywhere!

59:44.715 --> 59:45.581
- Shh!

59:45.583 --> 59:46.782
Keep it down.

59:51.255 --> 59:54.256
(water splashing)

59:55.192 --> 59:57.659
(sighing)

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:11.273
- You don't get it.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:12.274
Do you?

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:15.143
- No.

01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:19.748
No, I don't.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:40.002
Did you think about what I said?

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:41.770
- Yes.

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:44.172
My answer is no.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:47.009
- Why not?

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:50.312
- Because he's my son.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.014
- He's my son too.

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:58.253
I don't want to put
him through this.

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:05.093
Let Kris stay with Parvathi if
we are going to be fighting.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:08.997
- I am his mother, not Parvathi!

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:12.067
Just stop fighting with me!

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.236
- Nothing I say is right.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.073
What happened to us?

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:23.145
- I can't talk to you either.

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.218
- [Jon] Do you love me?

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:46.001
- [Clara] Switch off the light.

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:47.369
I need to sleep.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:24.272
(door sliding)

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:34.149
- [Valli] Kris.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:35.150
Kris!

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.519
Kris!

01:02:42.459 --> 01:02:44.326
- [Kris] Hey, Valli.

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:47.896
- [Valli] Your bed
is not comfortable?

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:48.964
- The water is warm.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:51.299
I must have dozed off.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.934
- You were a tree before.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.536
Now you are a fish.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:02.177
Come along now,
everybody is waiting.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.413
- Give me my clothes, Valli!

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:07.048
- Come and get them.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.450
- If you insist.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:12.053
Come a little closer,
Valli, please.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:14.055
- You must be feeling like
the Gopikas that Krishna

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:16.091
stole the clothes from.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.961
- So you want to see me naked?

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:23.098
(light piano music)

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:39.347
- Did you find Skanda?

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:40.482
- Yes, Amma.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:44.853
He was sleeping in the mud pond.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:45.921
- Mud pond?

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:49.991
- He was naked.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.059
(gasping)

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.195
- You saw him naked?

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:54.396
- [Valli] No, Amma.

01:03:54.398 --> 01:03:56.097
- Then?

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:58.834
- His clothes were by the pond.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.837
(sighing)

01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:08.276
Amma.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:09.277
- Yes.

01:04:09.279 --> 01:04:13.915
- Was Appa ever
jealous of you and Jon?

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:21.857
- There were moments.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:25.727
- So?

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:26.994
- What do you want to know?

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:28.964
- Nothing.

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:42.577
What are you writing?

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:43.879
- My diary.

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:46.448
- Could I look?

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:51.586
Oh, okay.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.675
(Jon humming)

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:26.054
- [Parvathi] I thought you
would be sleeping by now.

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:28.523
- Parvathi, I didn't see you.

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:33.328
I couldn't sleep.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.329
- Why not?

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:38.033
- I keep hearing this melody and

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:40.535
I can't figure out what it is.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.537
It's killing me.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:43.538
- Hum it.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.244
(Jon humming)

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.225
That is Hemavati.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.963
It is one of my favorite Ragas.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.299
(vocalizing)

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:40.996
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:06:47.404 --> 01:06:50.672
¶ You know as well as I do ¶

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.642
¶ Why we cannot sleep ¶

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:58.313
¶ Are we dying a
little every night ¶

01:06:58.315 --> 01:07:02.384
¶ In hopes of something more ¶

01:07:02.386 --> 01:07:06.521
¶ In this moment
of your longing ¶

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:10.658
¶ I am the one who burns ¶

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.627
¶ With you ¶

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:15.296
(vocalizing)

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:26.775
¶ Let go of all that's proper ¶

01:07:26.777 --> 01:07:30.345
¶ Cast aside all
that's ornament ¶

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:33.515
¶ Allow me to
explore your depths ¶

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:38.653
¶ Your fire with
my wetness burns ¶

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:42.624
¶ In this moment
of your longing ¶

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:46.194
¶ I'm the one who burns ¶

01:07:46.196 --> 01:07:51.332
¶ With you ¶

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.302
¶ The one who claims
your love is far ¶

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:57.405
¶ Here's the moment
we've been waiting for ¶

01:07:57.407 --> 01:08:00.308
¶ Let's stretch this
time and make it last ¶

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:05.447
¶ 1,000 years
before he returns ¶

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.518
¶ In this moment
of your longing ¶

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.722
¶ I'm the one who
burns with you ¶

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.296
(vocalizing)

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.285
¶ I'll clothe you with
my lingering eyes ¶

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:46.587
(vocalizing)

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.157
¶ All things covered
when I'm done ¶

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.459
(vocalizing)

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:54.529
¶ No saying where you
begin, where I end ¶

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:57.265
(vocalizing)

01:08:57.267 --> 01:09:00.368
¶ With languorous limbs,
in play and flow ¶

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.837
(vocalizing)

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:08.877
¶ There is nothing
more beautiful ¶

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:13.581
¶ Than love that's
naked, unadorned ¶

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:17.285
¶ In this moment
of your longing ¶

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:21.923
¶ I'm the one who burns ¶

01:09:21.925 --> 01:09:24.526
¶ With you ¶

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:47.582
- [Parvathi] Jon, stand here.

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:58.660
Remove your shirt.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:13.708
Let your hair down.

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:23.618
You are just as
naked when you sing.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.753
- What do you mean?

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:29.757
- [Parvathi] Your voice has
a quality of wild abandon,

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:32.260
passionate, without decorum

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:35.530
and all consuming,

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.535
claiming for itself, all
who chance to listen.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.575
- I have never received
a better compliment.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.950
(peacock crying)

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.325
Clara, stop!

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:40.361
Why are you doing this to us?

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:41.829
- To us?

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:43.698
There is no us!

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.699
Us is over!

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:47.969
- Kris needs me too.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:51.072
- Yes, he does, so come with us.

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.441
- You know I can't just leave.

01:11:53.443 --> 01:11:55.076
I have commitments here.

01:11:55.078 --> 01:11:56.811
We have programs.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:58.646
I'm their singer.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.316
- You decide, what's
more important to you.

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:04.485
Your son, or your
stupid commitments!

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.988
- This music is my life.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.723
How do you expect me
to leave all this?

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:10.391
- All this?

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:11.526
Or Parvathi?

01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:15.563
- She's my friend and teacher.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:18.866
You are blinded
by your jealousy.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.501
- I'm leaving.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.969
You make your choice now.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:23.638
I'm doing this for Kris.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.872
He needs to go to school!

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:27.608
- You're using
Kris to punish me.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.444
You don't love him.

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:30.745
You just love yourself.

01:12:30.747 --> 01:12:33.615
- So, why don't you come along

01:12:33.616 --> 01:12:36.484
and prove that you love
Kris more than yourself!

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:38.553
- I can't leave.

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.655
Just leave Kris and
go wherever you want.

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.590
I'll take care of him.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:44.926
- Like hell you will!

01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.461
She owns you.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.129
Don't you see that?

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:50.498
He will be running
around getting dirty

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.000
while you are waiting for her.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.903
I want a different future,

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:57.572
for Kris, for myself!

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:58.539
- Stop!

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:04.045
I'm begging you.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:05.513
Don't do this.

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:09.851
- It's too late.

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:33.708
- This is Rudraksha,

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.043
tear drop of Shiva.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:37.912
It will protect you.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:44.085
Wear it always, Skanda.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:47.088
- Why did Shiva cry?

01:13:48.825 --> 01:13:51.159
- Because his son was
going away from him,

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:52.160
far away!

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:01.102
- Come, Parvathi.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:04.172
We cannot make it
more difficult for him

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:05.973
than it already is.

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:42.043
- Dad, will you come visit me?

01:14:46.082 --> 01:14:47.215
- Yes, Kris.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.517
Yes, I promise.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:57.158
I love you.

01:15:17.113 --> 01:15:20.181
- [Valli] I won't
let you go, Kris.

01:15:59.155 --> 01:16:02.156
(engine rumbling)

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.357
(sobbing)

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:56.143
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:58.613
(sobbing)

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:20.801
(sobbing)

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:36.217
- Your father sings
with his soul.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:39.420
I don't always
understand the words.

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:41.322
But it never matters.

01:17:49.432 --> 01:17:50.782
- Why?

01:17:50.783 --> 01:17:52.133
- He listens to me singing.

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:56.270
Then he sings his own
song, using his own words.

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.841
- What's it like

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:04.345
to dance to his music?

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.217
- It's a part of our life.

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:15.122
So, when he disappears,
like right now,

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:16.724
there is a void.

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:22.146
- There's something of him

01:18:22.147 --> 01:18:24.164
in every song I've
ever danced to.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:31.338
- Did you take to
school in America?

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:38.045
- In the beginning

01:18:40.016 --> 01:18:41.749
it was really bad.

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.854
Everyone made fun of me.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:51.125
I didn't understand
anything of their,

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:52.259
their rules.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.397
I didn't speak to anyone.

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:58.899
I found it hard to breathe.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.738
I didn't understand
why all of a sudden

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.273
none of you were there for me.

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:10.778
That's what hurt the most.

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:16.851
I told myself that
I was to blame.

01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:19.520
That Dad didn't love me anymore.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:23.157
That you and Parvathi Akka,

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.259
you didn't care.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:28.062
- We were not able to reach you.

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:30.297
We tried for a long time!

01:19:31.901 --> 01:19:33.334
All the letters

01:19:33.336 --> 01:19:35.753
that Jon wrote to you,

01:19:35.754 --> 01:19:38.171
to your grandparents
address were returned.

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:39.473
Where were you?

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:43.444
- Everywhere!

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:49.116
We never stayed in a place
for more than two years.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.087
- That explains it.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.158
- I thought you
knew where we were!

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:08.803
- Kris.

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.205
Kris!

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:15.442
Go change, Kris.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:19.113
- [Nagarajan] Go on.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.120
(light piano music)

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:53.047
- [Valli] It is Jon who
showed me this place.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:55.416
- [Kris] It's so peaceful.

01:20:55.418 --> 01:20:56.517
- We used to come here

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.519
for our walk together.

01:21:00.456 --> 01:21:03.057
- [Kris] Did he think of me?

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:04.058
- Often!

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:18.906
Where did you go
when you left here?

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:20.958
- America.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.009
To live with my
grandparents in San Jose.

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:24.979
That was for the
first two years.

01:21:24.981 --> 01:21:28.182
After that, Mom got
a job in New York.

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:30.451
That was for a year, then,

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:34.021
London, and after that, Perth.

01:21:34.023 --> 01:21:35.022
- Wow!

01:21:35.024 --> 01:21:39.159
I would love to see
those places too.

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:41.896
Some day!

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:45.165
- Yeah.

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:47.101
But I missed Kaavadi.

01:21:48.004 --> 01:21:49.637
I missed all of you.

01:21:55.912 --> 01:21:59.613
- How did you stay in
touch with Bharatanatyam?

01:21:59.615 --> 01:22:00.915
- I was 18.

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:03.183
We had just moved to Perth.

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:05.019
There was a Kalakshetra teacher

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.221
staying in our neighborhood.

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:11.125
One day, I just really
wanted to dance.

01:22:11.127 --> 01:22:13.093
So I joined her classes

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:16.330
and I never stopped
going after that.

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:20.601
- Did it happen during practice?

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.972
- It happened in class too.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:27.708
- That's terrible.

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:31.345
- No, it was a good thing.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:35.449
My teacher saw me standing
there like that, you know,

01:22:35.451 --> 01:22:38.519
all of a sudden,
rooted to the ground.

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.154
We talked.

01:22:40.156 --> 01:22:41.588
I told her of my life in Kaavadi

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:44.325
and everything that
had happened since.

01:22:44.327 --> 01:22:46.844
She helped me understand

01:22:46.845 --> 01:22:49.362
that I needed to reconnect
with my father to dance again.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:52.099
She really helped me see that.

01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:01.976
- You'll be okay, Kris.

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:03.077
You'll see.

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:07.114
- [Sabapathy] There was
no one to protect Sita

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:08.382
in the forest.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:12.553
- Sita is the daughter
of Mother Earth.

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:15.255
She doesn't need protection.

01:23:15.257 --> 01:23:20.027
It is Rama who became vulnerable
when he sent her away.

01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:22.062
- It's so true what you say!

01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:26.300
Without Sita, life loses
its charm for Rama.

01:23:26.302 --> 01:23:28.068
- She accompanies
him into the forest

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:30.004
only to watch over him.

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:33.173
Ravana lost everything
when he offended her.

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.009
- Has Rama no role now?

01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:39.346
- If you ask me, the epic
should be named Sitayana.

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:41.415
- I agree.

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:45.285
- You are beginning to worry me.

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:47.254
The public will not like this.

01:23:47.256 --> 01:23:50.290
The story has to start
with Sita pregnant,

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:51.725
all alone in the forest.

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:54.028
- Why would she be alone?

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.330
I see the forest
deities worshiping her.

01:23:56.332 --> 01:24:00.701
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:02.436
- That is so true!

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.269
(light orchestral music)

01:27:37.953 --> 01:27:39.286
- Beautiful!

01:27:40.322 --> 01:27:41.822
- [Valli] Is that Sita?

01:27:41.824 --> 01:27:43.423
- [Parvathi] No.

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:47.394
- It's my mother.

01:27:48.631 --> 01:27:49.763
- Yes.

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:51.865
She was pregnant with you.

01:27:51.867 --> 01:27:54.368
We were celebrating.

01:27:54.370 --> 01:27:56.670
- That painting in my room,

01:27:56.672 --> 01:27:58.372
it's of my Dad.

01:27:58.374 --> 01:27:59.006
Isn't it?

01:27:59.008 --> 01:28:00.440
- Yes, Skanda.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:04.344
- You've painted him
like a guardian deity.

01:28:04.346 --> 01:28:06.480
- That is how I see him.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:12.686
- Kris, there's somewhere
I'd like to take you.

01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:14.821
- [Kris] Where?

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:16.556
- [Valli] Come on.

01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:28.735
- [Sabapathy] Your daughter
has a mind of her own.

01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:37.978
- Sita should hate Rama, right?

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:41.014
For what he did to her.

01:28:42.084 --> 01:28:43.950
- But she doesn't.

01:28:43.952 --> 01:28:46.353
How's that even possible?

01:28:47.389 --> 01:28:49.723
- Because she understands him.

01:28:49.725 --> 01:28:53.093
That what he had to
do, is what he did.

01:28:54.463 --> 01:28:57.998
Even though it is terrible
beyond imagination,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.735
it is love that
made her understand.

01:29:01.737 --> 01:29:05.739
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:29:07.343 --> 01:29:11.478
- Do you think my parents
understood each other?

01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:15.949
- The question is if
they loved each other.

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:20.454
- I don't know.

01:29:27.896 --> 01:29:31.365
- What is love,
without understanding?

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:36.036
- True.

01:29:57.159 --> 01:29:59.760
- [Valli] You see that name?

01:30:00.662 --> 01:30:02.729
- [Kris] Skanda Ashram.

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:06.700
- We missed you, Skanda.

01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:22.682
May I ask you something?

01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:23.850
- What is it?

01:30:23.852 --> 01:30:28.088
- Were you ever jealous
of Amma and Jon?

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:35.195
- Yes.

01:30:37.032 --> 01:30:40.100
But, only until I
saw the painting.

01:30:41.069 --> 01:30:44.938
- The one that's hanging
inside Jon's room?

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.906
- Yes.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.976
Then, I understood.

01:30:49.978 --> 01:30:52.712
I couldn't be jealous anymore.

01:31:41.864 --> 01:31:46.199
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:47.634
- Jon is back!

01:31:49.638 --> 01:31:52.706
¶ You are to me ¶

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:57.811
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

01:31:58.514 --> 01:32:01.748
¶ To find you near ¶

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:06.086
¶ I close my eyes ¶

01:32:06.088 --> 01:32:10.790
¶ A ball of thread
rolling on and on ¶

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:15.529
¶ Connected from
beginning to end ¶

01:32:15.531 --> 01:32:19.566
¶ Never together
yet never apart ¶

01:32:19.568 --> 01:32:22.836
¶ It's my longing
that keeps me alive ¶

01:32:22.838 --> 01:32:27.974
¶ Like there's no tomorrow ¶

01:32:28.544 --> 01:32:33.280
¶ Tomorrow ¶

01:32:37.119 --> 01:32:41.821
¶ It's my longing
that keeps me alive ¶

01:32:41.823 --> 01:32:43.807
(bell ringing)

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:45.792
¶ If I only could
find my voice ¶

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:48.929
(light sitar music)

01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:52.412
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:35:56.885 --> 01:36:00.053
¶ You are to me ¶

01:36:00.055 --> 01:36:04.791
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

01:36:04.793 --> 01:36:08.528
¶ To find you near ¶

01:36:08.530 --> 01:36:12.866
¶ I close my eyes ¶

01:36:12.868 --> 01:36:16.903
¶ A ball of thread
rolling on and on ¶

01:36:16.905 --> 01:36:21.174
¶ Connected from
beginning to end ¶

01:36:21.176 --> 01:36:24.811
¶ Never together
yet never apart ¶

01:36:24.813 --> 01:36:27.914
¶ It's my longing
that keeps me alive ¶

01:36:27.916 --> 01:36:33.052
¶ Like there's no tomorrow ¶

01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:35.421
¶ Tomorrow ¶

01:36:54.342 --> 01:36:58.077
¶ Where have you been ¶

01:36:58.079 --> 01:37:02.148
¶ All this while ¶

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:06.019
¶ To find you near ¶

01:37:06.021 --> 01:37:10.356
¶ I close my eyes ¶

01:37:10.358 --> 01:37:14.227
¶ Across the blazing sands ¶

01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:18.565
¶ Through the deep dark waters ¶

01:37:18.567 --> 01:37:22.168
¶ Every possible
pain I've survived ¶

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.138
¶ Because of my
longing for you ¶

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:30.276
¶ Like there's no tomorrow ¶

01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:33.079
¶ Tomorrow ¶

01:37:51.433 --> 01:37:56.169
¶ It's my longing
that keeps me alive ¶

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.640
(vocalizing)

01:38:07.649 --> 01:38:11.651
¶ It's my longing
that keeps me alive ¶

01:38:11.653 --> 01:38:16.289
¶ If I only could
find my voice ¶

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:19.893
¶ Lost somewhere
in all this noise ¶

01:38:19.895 --> 01:38:22.896
¶ I'd sing and you would dance ¶

01:38:22.898 --> 01:38:28.034
¶ Like there's no tomorrow ¶

01:38:28.436 --> 01:38:32.171
¶ Tomorrow ¶

01:38:32.173 --> 01:38:36.342
¶ Like there's no ¶

01:38:36.344 --> 01:38:40.446
¶ Tomorrow ¶

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:45.318
¶ Tomorrow ¶

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:48.454
¶ You are to me ¶

01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:53.092
¶ Both fire and ice ¶

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:56.996
¶ To find you near ¶

01:38:56.998 --> 01:38:59.933
¶ I close my eyes ¶

01:39:18.019 --> 01:39:20.954
(all applauding)

01:39:28.697 --> 01:39:31.564
We've always been together, Kris

01:39:32.634 --> 01:39:35.101
Nothing could separate us.

01:39:36.137 --> 01:39:38.071
Not all this time.

01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:40.073
Not all this distance.

01:39:41.242 --> 01:39:42.976
Every time I sang,

01:39:43.511 --> 01:39:45.378
I sang only for you.

01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:48.648
- [Kris] And every
time I danced,

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:51.184
I danced only for you, Dad.

01:39:59.127 --> 01:40:02.061
(all applauding)

01:40:14.275 --> 01:40:17.210
(all applauding)

01:40:23.318 --> 01:40:26.252
(all applauding)

01:40:33.328 --> 01:40:37.330
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:47.707
- [Valli] Will you come
with us to Devaprayag?

01:40:47.709 --> 01:40:49.275
- The Himalayas?

01:40:53.782 --> 01:40:54.747
Yes.

01:40:56.384 --> 01:40:59.619
- We'll fulfill your
grandmother's vow.

01:41:02.457 --> 01:41:06.459
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:12.198
(vocalizing)

01:41:20.642 --> 01:41:22.408
- [Sabapathy] You see,

01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:27.547
Jon is a success even when
he crashes a performance!

01:41:28.083 --> 01:41:30.183
(chuckling)

01:41:41.463 --> 01:41:45.465
(singing in foreign language)

01:43:16.324 --> 01:43:20.326
(singing in foreign language)

01:43:49.891 --> 01:43:51.624
¶ At night ¶

01:43:51.626 --> 01:43:54.293
¶ When dreams grow tall ¶

01:43:54.295 --> 01:43:57.863
¶ In that land without
the usual laws ¶

01:43:57.865 --> 01:44:01.467
¶ I'll fall without moving ¶

01:44:01.469 --> 01:44:05.471
¶ I'll fly without wings ¶

01:44:05.473 --> 01:44:07.840
¶ With the truth ¶

01:44:07.842 --> 01:44:10.810
¶ Free ¶

01:44:10.812 --> 01:44:13.713
¶ To change its shape ¶

01:44:13.715 --> 01:44:15.581
¶ I wake up every mornin' ¶

01:44:15.583 --> 01:44:17.683
¶ To the music of my dreams ¶

01:44:17.685 --> 01:44:21.887
¶ Seeping into a
new days light ¶

01:44:21.889 --> 01:44:25.891
(singing in foreign language)
