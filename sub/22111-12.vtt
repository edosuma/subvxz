WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.004
*

00:25.593 --> 00:27.595
*

00:38.839 --> 00:40.374
Ah.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.556
*

01:09.870 --> 01:12.440
All right, we're
all set. Fire away.
Too busy.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.841
You are not too busy.
I am too busy.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.844
This how we start
our morning?
Mm.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.347
Good morning.
Kens, you have the clue. Go.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.881
And, no, we're not fighting.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.783
Uh, well,
somebody is annoyed though.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.717
Yeah

01:23.751 --> 01:25.519
About a stupid game.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.787
It's not a stupid game.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.291
It is an educational activity to
hone your skills of deduction.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.659
Sounds interesting.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.194
Sounds like a waste of time.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.296
DEEKS: What?! Uh,
when soccer players

01:35.329 --> 01:36.830
run wind sprints,
is that a waste of time?

01:36.864 --> 01:39.500
When football players hit the
gym, is that a waste of time?

01:39.533 --> 01:42.503
No. And neither is this, because
it's gonna make all of us

01:42.536 --> 01:43.904
better special agents.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.640
All right.
Let the games begin.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.176
I love this attitude.
All right, I'm gonna give you

01:48.209 --> 01:50.478
an enigmatic statement.
You're gonna ask questions

01:50.511 --> 01:51.612
to ascertain
the truth.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.181
Why did the chicken
cross the road?

01:53.214 --> 01:54.915
Ignore this.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.785
A man pushes his car

01:57.818 --> 01:59.820
up to a hotel

01:59.853 --> 02:01.422
and says, "I have no money."

02:01.455 --> 02:02.490
Sam Dawg?

02:02.523 --> 02:03.924
Why is he pushing the car?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.859
No, you got to ask questions
that I can answer

02:05.893 --> 02:06.827
with yes or no.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.196
Did the car break down?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.263
No.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.232
Does the car have gas
in the tank?

02:11.265 --> 02:12.900
These are good questions. No.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.669
Is he trading the car for
a free room at the hotel?

02:15.703 --> 02:18.639
Well, that is
an interesting theory, but no.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.908
So the car's out of gas and...

02:20.941 --> 02:22.743
No, no. No.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.212
KENSI:
No

02:24.245 --> 02:26.880
You're contradicting yourself
now. I'm sorry,

02:26.914 --> 02:29.417
you said there was
no gas in the tank.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.319
Was the man
pushing the car

02:31.352 --> 02:33.387
wearing a kilt?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.656
Seriously?

02:35.689 --> 02:37.391
Yeah.
Was he?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.527
That is arguably
the most idiotic question

02:39.560 --> 02:40.661
I've ever heard.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.830
But, also, n-no, he was...

02:42.863 --> 02:43.964
he was not.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.800
Okay. Was it snowing outside?

02:46.834 --> 02:47.935
I got a question.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.870
Eric, why did you whistle?

02:49.903 --> 02:52.473
I whistled
because I love this game,

02:52.506 --> 02:54.608
and I think we have a case.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.444
You think or you know?

02:56.477 --> 02:57.978
Well, Mosley's up there,
and she's, uh,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.880
a little tight-lipped.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.250
KENSI:
Oh, what a shame.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.684
Game over!

03:03.717 --> 03:05.686
Is it

03:05.719 --> 03:09.690
Or has the game just begun?

03:09.723 --> 03:12.493
So, this morning,
at the crack of dawn,

03:12.526 --> 03:15.896
there was yet another brush fire
in the Los Padres foothills.

03:15.929 --> 03:16.797
SAM:
Any casualties?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.499
ERIC: One death. No
structural damage.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.800
100% contained.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.902
They I.D. the body?
MOSLEY: Not yet.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.971
But the arson investigators
have determined the cause

03:24.004 --> 03:25.973
of the blaze
as being next-generation,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.342
military-grade napalm.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.543
What

03:29.577 --> 03:30.878
That's what they use
in incendiary bombs.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.680
Didn't they ban that
after Vietnam?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.349
Banned it against civilians,
but the last time we used it

03:35.383 --> 03:38.252
in a military installation
was Iraq, '03.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.853
The Mark 77 weapons
are being stored

03:39.887 --> 03:42.423
at Fallbrook Naval
Weapons Station near Pendleton.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.893
Each carries 75 gallons
of fuel gel.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.995
Any of them missing?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.930
Still waiting for confirmation.

03:49.963 --> 03:50.864
DEEKS: So if one of
those were stolen...

03:50.898 --> 03:51.999
What would
the damage be?

03:52.032 --> 03:53.434
Dropped from a plane,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.836
2,500 square yards
of burns, asphyxiation,

03:55.869 --> 03:57.771
carbon monoxide poisoning.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.973
We'll check out
the arson site.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.975
Send us the GPS.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.644
Already did.
Already did.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.812
Oops.
Jinx.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.814
Oh, and, Deeks,

04:06.847 --> 04:10.284
did the guy who was pushing the
car know the owner of the hotel?

04:10.318 --> 04:11.485
Yes.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.020
Yes, he did.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.522
Nice work, Sam.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.923
We're gonna get this.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.626
I believe in you.
MOSLEY: Okay,

04:18.659 --> 04:21.395
you should have a chat with
the station's ordnance officer.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.030
All right, cool, if we're going
south, I know this place

04:23.063 --> 04:24.832
in Laguna; it's got
the best fish tacos in L.A.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.834
Deeks, not today.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.502
No, no, it's fine. It's
on the way. We just stop there.
Stop.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.037
We'll get it to go. Eat it in
the Audi. She spills everywhere.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.905
It's great.
Let's not do this.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.642
Fallbrook can be handled
remotely by you and Hidoko.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.944
You are being
called back to LAPD.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.413
What? Is this...
is this punishment

04:39.447 --> 04:41.682
because I asked
if "Mosley" was Irish?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.351
I wasn't the one
who made the request.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.853
There's a mandatory
active shooter course.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.655
I thought you did that course
last month.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.057
Listen, it's like playing
laser tag on a video screen,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.992
which I don't need,
because I have

04:52.025 --> 04:53.961
more real-world experience
than SWAT.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.830
Apparently, this is mandatory
if you want to keep your job,

04:56.864 --> 04:59.433
your benefits,
and your pension.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.101
We should go. Let's go.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.004
Let's go.
I do like that dental plan.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.011
They found the body
down the hill.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.614
Remains of the ride.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.082
We got lucky.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.917
There's no homes around here.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.119
Why would somebody
torch an empty field?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.788
Pyromaniac?

05:20.821 --> 05:21.955
Just for kicks?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.023
Yeah, with napalm?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.793
Well, could have been a test.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.060
For something bigger.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.063
Well, so much
for the license plate.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.133
Napalm burns at 1,200 degrees.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.468
Liquefied
the aluminum.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.969
Steel doesn't melt
until 1,500.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.605
And you know this because...?

05:37.638 --> 05:40.073
Because I do.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.142
The bike broke apart.

05:42.175 --> 05:46.914
Guess it's a good thing I
didn't wear my Yeezys today.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.516
What is that, a beer bottle?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.918
Glass melts at 1,250.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.520
How 'bout marshmallows?

05:52.553 --> 05:54.154
Really.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.823
It could be useful information.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.158
If we want to make
the-the perfect s'more.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.960
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.562
Gas tank.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.697
Yeah.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.132
Heyo.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.602
This survived pretty well.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.139
Steel VIN.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.075
Heat melted
the rivets.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.546
Wonder Twin powers activate.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.949
ERIC: Okay, we ran the VIN
with the DMV.

06:21.982 --> 06:25.953
So, the incinerated motorbike
is registered to a Zack Fuller,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.054
age 20.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.989
ERIC:
We have an address.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.024
All right, send
Kensi and Hidoko.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.627
Okay, they are
wrapping up Fallbrook,

06:33.661 --> 06:35.729
and you'll be
working with ATF.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.731
All right, we're gonna stay here
and poke around some more.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.832
ERIC:
Copy that.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.535
Kick some ash.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.539
He was a nice young man.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.174
It's a shame.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.176
I warned him about
motorcycles.

06:49.209 --> 06:53.113
When I gave up my license,
I offered him my Volvo.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.848
That's very kind of you.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.651
Did he ever have any friends
or relatives come by?

06:57.685 --> 06:59.853
I have rules for my renters.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.922
No overnight guests.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.557
He kept to himself.

07:03.591 --> 07:07.661
In two years, he never
even had a daytime guest.

07:07.695 --> 07:10.097
Oh, we're waiting
for a search warrant.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.867
The boy is dead.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.836
Do your job.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.038
Okay.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.774
Oh, wow.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.843
Certainly kept a tidy room.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.845
If you find
the next of kin,

07:24.878 --> 07:26.914
I'll refund
his cleaning deposit.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.216
It's the very least I can do.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.151
Did he have a fish tank?

07:31.184 --> 07:33.687
No, he had an aquarium
cleaning business.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.222
He made house calls.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.758
Do you mind if I take a look
at the closet?

07:37.791 --> 07:40.027
Knock yourself out.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.929
Thank you.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.937
Sorry, could I trouble you
for some water, please?

07:49.970 --> 07:50.938
Be right back, dear.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.040
Thank you so much.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.210
Empty containers
of benzene,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.079
kerosene, phosphorous,
nitric acid.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.881
If these are
the ingredients

08:00.914 --> 08:02.616
for napalm,
there's over 50 gallons here.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.618
It's enough to take down
the Staples Center,

08:04.652 --> 08:07.254
the Federal Building,
a terminal at LAX.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.122
Well, question is,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.124
who has it now

08:11.158 --> 08:13.193
and what are they planning?

08:23.303 --> 08:26.874
Okay, so it looks like Zack
Fuller's adoptive parents

08:26.907 --> 08:29.276
died two years ago
in a car crash.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.211
He has no known
living relatives.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.213
And aside from
his motorcycle registration,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.282
there's not even a pinky toe

08:35.315 --> 08:36.884
Everyone's got
a digital footprint.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.752
Au contraire.

08:38.786 --> 08:42.222
No credit card, bank account,
cell phone, or e-mail.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.290
What about
his income tax?

08:43.323 --> 08:45.959
NELL:
Paid in cash at a 7-Eleven.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.060
What?

08:47.094 --> 08:49.697
It takes a lot of effort
to live unplugged like that.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.331
Well, he had
to have had a reason.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.667
Well, we do know that, in 2015,

08:53.701 --> 08:57.070
he started Navy Boot Camp
at Great Lakes NTC.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.206
Without completing
basic training.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.309
Way to bury the lede.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.244
NELL: We call it saving
the best for last.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.046
Well, check his OMPF
in Tennessee.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.082
If a superior failed him, he
could have been seeking revenge.

09:10.283 --> 09:13.621
"Gavin & Sun.
Solar installation and service."

09:13.654 --> 09:16.089
MARTHA: That's right.
Zack took care of it.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.625
He wanted to save the planet.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.326
I just wanted to save
a few bucks.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.295
A price tag from
Caroline's Aquarium.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.297
KENSI:
We should pay them a visit.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.933
Yeah.
MARTHA: You can't.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.100
They went out of business.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.369
Oh. Well, then we should
find the owner.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.871
You're talking to her.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.039
Really?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.206
Who's Caroline?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.142
We named it
for the Caroline Islands,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.343
where my husband fought.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.212
Really

09:39.246 --> 09:41.114
First Marine division
at Peleliu.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.350
Wow, that was
a two-month battle.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.152
Took him ten years
to get over it.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.755
We opened up the shop in 1955.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.122
Mm, you had a long run.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.290
Hell, I'd still be in business

09:50.323 --> 09:52.292
if it weren't for Amazon
and Petco.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.294
Zack bought all this from you?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.362
He was a regular.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.364
I'd give him referrals
from folks

09:57.397 --> 10:00.300
who were too damn lazy
to clean their own tank.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.169
How did his clients
get in contact with him?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.303
He didn't have a cell phone.

10:03.336 --> 10:07.107
You can leave a message with me
or meet him for coffee.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.776
8:00 a.m. every morning.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.678
Borgese's Cafe.

10:10.711 --> 10:11.979
Hmm.
MOSLEY: Kensi.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.181
I'm so sorry.
A call from the office.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.016
Excuse us.

10:18.686 --> 10:22.656
Kensi, hazmat ETA
is five minutes.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.024
All right, we got
a couple leads.

10:24.057 --> 10:24.958
Yes.

10:24.992 --> 10:28.428
The solar contractor
and the coffee shop.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.864
How...
Hidoko filled me in.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.700
Okay.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.801
Where are Callen and Sam?

10:33.834 --> 10:37.104
They're looking into
Zack's connection to the Navy.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.939
He lasted two months
at basic training.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.173
I just got his reviews.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.308
Only two months?

10:41.341 --> 10:43.443
Okay, that must mean poor
performance or misconduct.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.380
No, actually,
he's got glowing reviews

10:47.414 --> 10:48.749
and an honorable discharge.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.117
KENSI:
So, why did he leave?

10:50.150 --> 10:53.086
He enlisted to work in the
Navy's Marine Mammal Program

10:53.120 --> 10:54.421
with mine-hunting dolphins.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.389
That fits.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.692
Yeah.
MOSLEY:
Which was eliminated

10:58.726 --> 11:01.328
and replaced
by an underwater drone program.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.262
ERIC:
Poor little dolphins.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.431
They can't catch a break, right?
I mean...

11:04.464 --> 11:05.632
first it's tuna nets,

11:05.665 --> 11:08.101
then they're being terminated
by a gang of evil fish-bots.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.437
Kensi, once hazmat arrives,

11:10.470 --> 11:12.405
you two can go check out
the solar company.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.174
Will do.

11:14.207 --> 11:17.010
Sam and Callen are headed
to the coffee shop.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.746
Oh, uh, hey,

11:18.779 --> 11:21.381
can I get a grande iced
sugar-free vanilla latte

11:21.414 --> 11:22.482
with almond milk?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.117
Why are you still here?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.253
Right.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.321
SAM: Like to ask you
a few questions.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.190
He look familiar?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.725
Why do you need to know?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.362
Because he's dead.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.264
From excessive police force?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.800
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear that.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.234
Do you know him?

11:41.268 --> 11:44.037
I'm not comfortable answering
without a lawyer present.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.505
You're not being arrested.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.874
You're not even
accused of anything.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.075
Well, not yet,
but in a minute,

11:48.108 --> 11:49.442
it's about to be
obstruction of justice.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.311
Yeah. It's five years
in prison.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.046
Really

11:53.080 --> 11:55.348
So predictable.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.517
Yeah, he looks familiar.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.853
Did he talk to you?

11:59.887 --> 12:02.489
No, he mostly kept to himself.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.390
"Mostly"?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.926
Sometimes he'd sit
with that girl, Amanda.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.828
The one with the purple laptop.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.364
SAM:
Thank you, Isaac.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.969
Amanda?

12:16.003 --> 12:18.038
Special Agent Callen.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.507
Special Agent
Sam Hanna. NCIS.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.342
No school today, huh?

12:22.375 --> 12:25.846
Oh, no, we can leave campus
for study period.

12:25.879 --> 12:29.382
Uh, the library's too rowdy
with all the gamers.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.151
What you working on?

12:31.184 --> 12:32.519
A philosophy paper.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.823
You know who this is?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.891
Zack.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.161
He died today.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.495
On his motorcycle.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.066
Oh, my God.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.868
Was he a friend?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.504
No. No, um, not at all.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.573
He tried to talk to me
a couple of times,

12:53.606 --> 12:55.175
but I shut him down.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.410
You know, I'm here
to do my homework.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.079
What'd he talk about?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.549
Uh, mostly about
how he hated technology.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.084
You know, he wanted people

13:04.117 --> 13:05.485
to have conversations
and connect,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.988
and, uh, definitely chose
the wrong place for that.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.091
SAM:
Hmm.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.325
He ever ask you out?

13:12.359 --> 13:15.462
No. No, um, I barely knew him.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.497
He seemed extremely shy.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.432
Well, if you hear
something else,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.201
give us a call.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.870
Okay.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.972
CALLEN:
Thanks for your time.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.941
Quite possibly the
world's worst liar.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.376
If you want the truth,

13:29.409 --> 13:31.912
it's right up there
on that wall.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.582
Okay, last one for the
east-facing array.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.585
Got it.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.587
Morning.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.389
Oh, hey.
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.291
Special Agent Harley Hidoko.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.526
NCIS.
Navy?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.562
Sorry, we can't install solar
on submarines.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.265
That's funny.
I'm Gavin. My son, Carson.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.967
Hey. Nice to meet you. Hey.
Nice to meet you.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.203
Do you guys remember
a client named Zack Fuller?

13:56.236 --> 13:57.905
Doesn't ring a bell.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.339
HIDOKO:
He rented a room

13:59.372 --> 14:01.608
from an elderly
woman, Martha Adams?

14:01.641 --> 14:04.144
Huh. I'm sorry.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.378
KENSI:
Does this help?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.015
Oh, yeah. Dad, uh...

14:08.048 --> 14:09.883
I don't think
you went out on that one.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.152
Did anyone visit Zack
during the installation?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.954
There was no installation.
He couldn't afford it.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.222
He did it himself.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.390
I just dropped off the panels.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.892
Did you notice anything unusual
at the house?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.062
Hmm.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.330
What?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.999
On his desk...

14:26.033 --> 14:27.901
there was a book.

14:27.935 --> 14:30.037
I think the title was in Arabic.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.438
It might have been the Koran.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.609
Thank you.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.180
This is Zack and Amanda
yesterday morning at 8:25 a.m.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.448
How long did they talk?

14:41.481 --> 14:43.150
NELL:
18 minutes.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.918
That definitely doesn't
fit her story.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.453
NELL:
Mm-hmm.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.156
CALLEN: Do we ever get a
good look at her computer?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.191
Not really.
Mm.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.225
Go back 24 hours.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.293
NELL:
Coming right up.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.365
SAM:
Two days in a row.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.367
There. Zoom in on that.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.935
Yeah.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.536
"Hot mirror."
NELL:
Hmm.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.337
You heard of it?

15:04.371 --> 15:05.572
Yeah, it's an anonymous
gossip site.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.541
Looks like there's a chat group
from Amanda's high school.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.178
Bringing up the URL now.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.547
Oh, man.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.419
They're ganging up on Amanda.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.420
It's vicious.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.622
It's cyberbullying.

15:22.655 --> 15:27.127
With all this abuse,
she may want to retaliate.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.096
If she asked Zack
to torch the school,

15:29.129 --> 15:31.198
all her bullies
would be in one place.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.434
Along with a thousand other
innocent kids and staff.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.597
WOMAN:  I'm coming.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.034
I'm coming.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.169
Tracey Delgado?
Yeah.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.637
Special Agent
Callen, NCIS.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.639
Special Agent Sam Hanna.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.407
Did we wake you up?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.143
Yeah. Sorry,
I just got off a 24.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.011
Oh, sorry about that.
You're a firefighter?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.412
Uh, paramedic.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.681
Is Amanda home?

16:21.714 --> 16:24.084
Should be soon.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.418
She's okay?

16:25.452 --> 16:27.254
She's fine. We, uh...

16:27.287 --> 16:29.556
are looking into someone she
may know from the coffee shop.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.591
Okay.
You mind if we wait?

16:31.624 --> 16:33.293
No, no, no. Come on in.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.468
So, did you get any
sleep last night?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.402
Oh, not much.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.637
And I've got an overtime
day shift tomorrow.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.273
That's how a single mom
saves for college.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.608
Hmm. She's lucky to have you.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.513
Look, we were wondering...

16:53.546 --> 16:56.249
what do you know about Amanda's
social media accounts?

16:56.283 --> 16:59.552
Everything.
I-I friend and follow her.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.454
I-I check her posts every night.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.589
Are you familiar
with Hot Mirror?

17:02.622 --> 17:03.623
No.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.558
It's an anonymous app...

17:05.592 --> 17:07.394
with a chat group

17:07.427 --> 17:09.696
from her high school.

17:09.729 --> 17:13.633
Seems that Amanda's
being bullied.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.136
Afraid these are kind of rough.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.174
"Amanda, you're a mistake

17:21.208 --> 17:22.642
that never
should have been born."

17:24.644 --> 17:26.713
"Why don't you kill yourself

17:26.746 --> 17:30.383
and make the world
a better place."

17:30.417 --> 17:32.719
"Yes, we should barbecue her

17:32.752 --> 17:35.355
and end world hunger."
Oh, my God.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.823
Does she talk to you
about this stuff?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.492
I mean, she-she told me

17:39.526 --> 17:41.794
that kids were teasing her
about her weight,

17:41.828 --> 17:44.831
but I told her to just ignore it
and it would go away.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.733
Why didn't she tell me?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.501
Well, she's a teenager.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.703
She wanted to handle it
on her own.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.772
How's she doing in school?

17:52.805 --> 17:56.343
Well, she used to get
straight As until last semester.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.312
I thought it was 'cause
classes were harder.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.747
Or it's from the bullying.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.116
Look, we're sensitive
to her situation,

18:03.150 --> 18:05.552
but our concern is that...

18:05.585 --> 18:08.788
Amanda might be thinking
about some sort of revenge.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.124
But you said the app
was anonymous.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.359
Who would she get back at?

18:12.392 --> 18:14.694
Maybe the whole school.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.763
The whole school?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.898
How?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.700
MAN:
Last one.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.170
That book title
the solar guy saw

18:23.203 --> 18:24.904
was Hindi, not Arabic.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.806
That's a discriminatory
assumption.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.677
Hmm.
Wait, did Zack study
eastern philosophy?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.512
Uh, no. Just a photo atlas

18:32.545 --> 18:33.813
showing reef fish
of the Indian Ocean.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.515
MOSLEY:
Okay, anything else

18:35.548 --> 18:37.484
hinting at a particular
ideology?

18:37.517 --> 18:40.587
No, not ideology,
just oceanography.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.754
NELL:
Okay, so...

18:41.788 --> 18:44.224
he's a lone wolf
with an unknown cause.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.626
Mmm.
Got something from
his recycling basket.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.829
It's a receipt for ten
cases of foam coffee cups.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.564
They're made of polystyrene.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.700
That's a key ingredient
in napalm.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.336
Yeah, you dissolve the cups
in a solvent

18:56.369 --> 18:58.405
to create a sticky compound.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.839
Can't be extinguished.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.242
Okay, well, he wouldn't
be able to transport ten boxes

19:02.275 --> 19:03.876
on his motorcycle;
he needed help.
Yeah.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.546
Okay, check the receipt
for the time and date.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.382
Not here.
It's torn off.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.485
Well, find it. That piece
of paper might solve the case.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.621
On it.
Yeah.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.793
Hello.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.695
Hey, love.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.667
What's going on?

19:27.700 --> 19:29.636
We have some more
questions for you.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.239
Take a seat, please.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.706
Okay.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.642
Thanks.

19:35.675 --> 19:39.512
Amanda, we saw video
with you and Zack

19:39.546 --> 19:42.815
having some rather
long conversations.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.585
I can lose track of time.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.854
It looked like you were
talking about Hot Mirror.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.957
I had no idea
kids could be so mean.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.326
Whatever.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.395
I've been teased about
how I look for so long

19:55.428 --> 19:56.829
that I don't let it
get to me.

19:56.863 --> 19:57.997
I don't pay attention.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.966
Well, it still hurts.

19:59.999 --> 20:03.970
SAM: I couldn't have dealt with
that when I was in high school.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.807
Did you talk to a teacher
about it?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.643
If they knew that
I'd ratted them out,

20:10.677 --> 20:12.379
it would get worse.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.347
You have no idea.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.816
Well, that can't be easy.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.353
Yeah.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.989
What's it like at school?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.595
What do you think?

20:28.628 --> 20:31.731
I know the minute
that I walk through the door,

20:31.764 --> 20:33.966
I get sick to my stomach.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.769
You know, every kid in class,

20:36.803 --> 20:38.405
every kid I pass in the hall,

20:38.438 --> 20:39.739
they all look at me

20:39.772 --> 20:42.041
and smirk like they've read
every single post

20:42.074 --> 20:43.510
and they all think that

20:43.543 --> 20:47.314
I'm just this
big fat pathetic loser.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.482
Well, that's not true.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.751
And you don't deserve
any of this.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.520
I love you.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.854
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

20:57.089 --> 21:00.560
We're gonna do everything
we can to help.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.962
Just have one question.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.901
Did Zack talk to you about
burning down the school?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.470
Are you crazy?

21:10.503 --> 21:12.939
He had a big supply of napalm.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.041
It's used in military bombs.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.978
What the hell?!

21:19.011 --> 21:21.047
So he never
said anything to you?

21:21.080 --> 21:23.816
No. No, never.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.487
Do you think Zack liked you?

21:28.521 --> 21:31.023
I mean, I guess.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.527
You know, no one else would ever
talk to him at coffee.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.629
Was Zack mad
that you were getting bullied?

21:37.997 --> 21:39.766
Yeah.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.835
Maybe he decided to burn down
the school by himself.

21:42.869 --> 21:45.572
Makes sense.

21:47.574 --> 21:50.443
Wanted to defend her
'cause no one else would help.

21:54.814 --> 21:59.619
Biodegradable bags of cans,
paper and bottles.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.622
Zack made her recycle
and compost everything.

22:02.655 --> 22:03.890
NELL:
So, any luck, you two?

22:03.923 --> 22:06.459
No. No sign of the receipt yet.

22:06.493 --> 22:07.660
Uh, good news here.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.028
We've accessed the
security hard drive

22:09.061 --> 22:10.563
at the Sharp and
Frugal parking lot.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.932
NELL: Yes, but it could take
several days to scan.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.767
Unless you get us
a date and time.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.102
Yeah. Okay.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.607
Why wasn't your receipt
thrown out with the rest of it?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.575
Well, it was stuck to the side
of the wastebasket.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.644
So maybe it was wet?

22:24.677 --> 22:27.614
Right. Check the bottles.
I'll check the cans.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.451
I feel so bad
for that girl.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.621
Yeah. High school
can be pretty tough.
Yeah.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.723
Cool kids made fun of me

22:36.756 --> 22:38.925
because I was in a program
for the gifted.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.394
I was a geek, a dweeb.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.396
No prom date.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.599
I was just really skinny
and tall during high school,

22:46.633 --> 22:49.702
and so, I got called
"Bag of Bones, Chicken Legs,"

22:49.736 --> 22:52.505
and, oh, my favorite--
"Olive Oil."

22:52.539 --> 22:54.407
She needs to hear
that it gets better.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.043
It's hard, but it does.
Yeah.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.116
Got it.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.986
January 2, 3:29 p.m.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.092
All right, nailed him.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.496
Okay, we have Zack walking out
with another young man.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.965
He is of medium build, wearing
a baseball cap and hoodie.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.132
Can you run facial rec?

23:20.166 --> 23:21.968
It's doubtful.
He's turned away.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.437
But we could look
for a reflection.

23:24.471 --> 23:27.139
All right, quickly. This could
be the guy with the napalm.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.575
LAPD will go after
the bullies.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.042
What they did
is a misdemeanor.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.078
You'll be protected
from retaliation.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.613
That's great.
I'll let 'em know.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.047
The school has
been informed.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.517
The chat group
has been shut down.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.719
Thank you.
Oh. Thank you so much.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.087
You're very welcome.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.188
Yeah. You keep
getting As.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.623
You're going places.

23:43.656 --> 23:44.857
Thanks.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.893
Take care of each other.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.597
My gosh.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.167
SAM: It's gonna take
some time to heal.

23:55.201 --> 23:57.003
Well, at least she's
talking about it.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.071
That's a pretty
good first step.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.674
I think we missed lunch.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.544
There's still 50 gallons
of napalm out there.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.146
I'll settle
for a drive-through.
Oh, now, that's

24:07.179 --> 24:09.048
music to my ears.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.157
Napalm doesn't explode.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.660
What the hell was that?

24:31.270 --> 24:32.338
It was an underground
natural gas leak.

24:32.371 --> 24:34.507
There was a big pocket
of methane under the patio.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.876
What, did the neighbor
have a leaky pipe?
FIREMAN: Not necessarily.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.045
The gas follows the path
of least resistance.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.047
Travels outside the pipes,
dissipates up into the air.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.282
Right. With a concrete
slab, it gets trapped,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.217
builds up until "boom."

24:45.251 --> 24:47.053
Did they find
the source?

24:47.086 --> 24:48.287
They will.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.558
Probably a corroded pipe,
could be blocks away.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.625
Is it still leaking?

24:52.659 --> 24:55.161
No. We cut off the gas
to the whole neighborhood.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.228
Oh. So much
for my shower.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.229
Plenty of hot water back

24:57.263 --> 24:58.030
at the station, Delgado.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.799
Yeah. Well, maybe
after my nap.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.067
This time with earplugs.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.869
Any more questions,

25:02.902 --> 25:05.071
I'll be next door.
Thanks, Captain.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.906
CALLEN:
Thank you.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.243
I'll be in in
a second, Mom.
Okay.

25:14.681 --> 25:18.217
Um... are you guys sure
it's safe?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.119
Well, they cut off
the gas, yeah.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.791
Did you want
to tell us something?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.995
CALLEN:
One, two, three.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.633
Okay. What are
we looking at?

25:33.666 --> 25:35.234
Fresh dirt in a hole?

25:35.267 --> 25:37.604
Last weekend,
Zack drilled down 30 feet

25:37.637 --> 25:38.771
with a water well-digger.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.740
You guys living
off the grid?

25:40.773 --> 25:43.009
He said it was how
to shut down my high school

25:43.042 --> 25:44.243
without hurting anyone.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.745
How does that work?

25:45.778 --> 25:47.847
Uh, there's a plugged oil well

25:47.880 --> 25:49.281
from the 1920s
under my back yard.

25:49.315 --> 25:52.251
And then it connects
to a natural gas field

25:52.284 --> 25:54.120
1,500 feet below.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.155
The old oil field
got pumped dry.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.725
They inject and withdraw
natural gas from the caverns.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.927
There's about a billion
cubic feet down there.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.228
He wanted to tap into that?

26:02.261 --> 26:03.630
Just a little bit.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.331
Just to shut down
the high school.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.000
He said he could make
a slow leak to feed into school.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.937
Instead he ended up blowing up
your neighbor's patio.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.705
Uh, he said he missed the well.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.373
He hit something.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.608
You helped him do this?

26:15.642 --> 26:17.710
No. No, it was all his idea.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.146
He said
there wouldn't be an explosion,

26:20.179 --> 26:23.315
just, you know, nausea
and headaches like Aliso Canyon?

26:25.217 --> 26:27.620
I just wanted
to stop the bullying.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.889
So earlier, you lied to us?
No.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.325
You asked me if I wanted
to burn down the school.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.361
I don't. I...

26:35.394 --> 26:37.630
I just need a break.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.198
You know, they'd have to

26:39.231 --> 26:41.200
shut down the school
for, like, a month.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.070
Look, Zack said he was going
to try a different location,

26:44.103 --> 26:45.638
a different well?

26:48.841 --> 26:50.710
Maybe Zack was planning
something bigger.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.745
AMANDA:
What do you mean?

26:55.314 --> 26:57.416
It's possible
that Zack was planning

26:57.449 --> 26:59.318
on pouring napalm
down the hole.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.153
Why?

27:01.187 --> 27:05.725
To turn your neighborhood
into a four-mile blast crater.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.161
He wouldn't do that.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.330
Who helped him move the drill?

27:11.363 --> 27:14.400
I don't know.
I wasn't here.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.635
I was at school.
My mom was working.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.243
I can't get anything
on this guy.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.679
No reflections,
never faces camera.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.849
Somebody's drilling down into
the Bayside natural gas field.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.417
What? That's ridiculous.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.686
You'd need
a 1,500-foot commercial drill.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.788
You don't. The oil wells

27:35.822 --> 27:38.424
in the 1920s were less
than 30 feet down.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.192
Right, but can you even
drill through them?

27:40.226 --> 27:43.696
Absolutely. They're capped with
cement and telephone poles.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.898
Yikes.
Come on, guys.
Tell me something good.

27:45.932 --> 27:46.999
Well, our mystery man

27:47.033 --> 27:48.234
could be barista Isaac

27:48.267 --> 27:50.102
from the coffee shop.
His height and build--

27:50.136 --> 27:52.038
pretty good match.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.040
NELL: Ooh. Light bulb.
Oh. Fresh idea?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.842
Uh, no.
Just security cam footage

27:55.875 --> 27:57.944
from the light bulb shop
next door. Check it out.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.012
Oh. We're on their backs.

28:00.046 --> 28:02.849
MOSLEY: Yeah, but look
where they're headed.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.417
That's the Gavin & Sun
solar truck.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.787
Zack was working with Carson,
the owner's son.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.289
Kensi and Hidoko spoke with him.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.425
All right, I'm gonna send Hidoko
and Kensi back to the work site.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.028
Hold up. Is that a well-driller
in the bed?

28:16.062 --> 28:18.430
ERIC:
Or are you just happy to see me?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.232
Don't make me
send you to HR.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.500
Inappropriate.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.268
Oh.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.403
Zack hit a
processed gas line.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.938
It smelled
like mercaptan.

28:25.972 --> 28:28.107
If he'd hit the well, it
would have been odorless.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.209
But he told Amanda he was going
to another location.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.478
We've I.D.'d Zack's accomplice.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.281
Carson Teed
from the solar company.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.282
He could be
drilling right now.

28:36.315 --> 28:40.152
We've got Kaleidoscope,
Kensi and Hidoko on it.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.287
SAM:
That's not enough.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.423
Fire department is doing
a methane sweep with detectors.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.158
That's 400 blocks.
It'll take forever.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.459
They're drilling in
an old oil well site.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.828
We need a map.

28:48.861 --> 28:49.962
MOSLEY:
We're working on that.

28:49.996 --> 28:53.499
I need you to get to the
Gavin & Sun office right now.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.371
Truck is gone.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.140
Homeowner said
they quit the job.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.209
They gave them the name of
another company to finish.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.944
Dad said there was
a family emergency.

29:04.977 --> 29:07.246
Carson's sister got into a
car accident and needs surgery.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.547
Can you verify that for us?

29:08.580 --> 29:12.484
Hey, guys,
does Carson have a sister?

29:15.988 --> 29:17.523
That would be a negative.

29:17.556 --> 29:20.292
In the words
of a great woman,

29:20.326 --> 29:22.528
"I sense
impending mayhem."

29:25.131 --> 29:27.133
Great. Out of business.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.006
Why would someone want

29:34.040 --> 29:36.175
to destroy thousands
of homes and lives?

29:36.208 --> 29:38.577
I haven't quite
figured that one out yet.

29:38.610 --> 29:41.080
I haven't seen one of those

29:41.113 --> 29:42.882
since high school.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.552
SAM:
It's a model rocket engine.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.254
Yeah.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.422
With a bunch of burnt fuses.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.593
You shoot a model rocket
down a gas well,

29:54.626 --> 29:57.096
you'll ignite the entire depth
in a few seconds.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.131
Even faster with napalm.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.401
Anything new on Carson?

30:02.434 --> 30:04.603
He's the poster child
for Earth Day.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.107
Recycling, solar power,
reduced ocean pollution.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.276
All good causes,
but we've learned

30:10.309 --> 30:12.244
that father Gavin
was arrested

30:12.278 --> 30:15.481
in 1985 for tree spiking
in Oregon.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.516
ERIC: He's, uh, more of
a radical, on the fringe.

30:17.549 --> 30:18.951
NELL:
Right.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.219
MOSLEY:
Zack partnered with them.

30:20.252 --> 30:22.521
Have Hidoko and
Kensi talk to Amanda

30:22.554 --> 30:24.356
and see if she
knows these guys.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.491
NELL: Yep.
We traced

30:25.524 --> 30:27.193
Carson and Gavin's
digital footprints.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.863
Both hit the same dead end at
a portal to a dark web site.

30:30.897 --> 30:33.900
Real environmentalists
don't need the dark web.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.434
Can you enter
the site?

30:35.467 --> 30:38.570
Well, it's practically
impossible.

30:38.604 --> 30:43.976
Unless... you purloin a copy
of the TOR key generator.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.012
You launch
a side channel attack

30:46.045 --> 30:48.347
using stochastic
cryptanalysis.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.649
And reconstruct
the secret key.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.985
Then you might
have a shot.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.486
Bingo.
MOSLEY:
Very nice.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.323
Whoa. They're
definitely not winning

30:57.356 --> 30:58.958
any Webby Awards.
Mm-mm.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.492
All right, topics.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.128
"Evils of Fossil Fuel,

31:02.161 --> 31:03.595
"Overpopulation Equals Death,

31:03.629 --> 31:06.432
Paris Accord-- Go to Hell, USA."

31:06.465 --> 31:09.268
"The idiots in Washington
can't accept the science

31:09.301 --> 31:11.403
"that global warming
is destroying us.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.172
Here's the congressional
hit list."

31:13.205 --> 31:15.908
Hit list? That's
figurative, right?

31:15.942 --> 31:17.977
Like, "Don't
reelect these guys"?
Hmm.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.478
I hope so.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.013
"911 Alert For Today."

31:21.047 --> 31:22.248
Click that link.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.952
"Since America's turning
a deaf ear to the crisis,

31:25.985 --> 31:28.287
we're taking a bold step
to send a message."

31:28.320 --> 31:31.390
Whoa. "If you live in L.A.
and value your life,

31:31.423 --> 31:34.460
stay away from Bayside
until after sunset."

31:34.493 --> 31:36.162
48,000 people live in Bayside.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.164
And sunset
is at 5:01 p.m.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.133
That gives us about an hour
before L.A. goes up in flames.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.434
Let's move this

31:42.468 --> 31:44.636
to the Roach Coach.
We're going in.

31:44.670 --> 31:45.704
To Bayside?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.006
All of us?

31:47.039 --> 31:48.174
All of us.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.541
Okay.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.356
ERIC: I've got every traffic cam
in Bayside.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.691
No hits yet on the solar guys.

32:05.724 --> 32:08.961
Maybe they
ditched the truck.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.563
You know what I can't stop
thinking about?
Hmm?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.265
Carson, the son,

32:13.299 --> 32:16.535
he wasn't born wanting
to hurt other people.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.637
He learned it
from his dad.

32:18.670 --> 32:22.274
Yep, unfortunately,
that's how it works.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.444
Okay, 50 blocks covered so far.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.114
350 to go.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.284
You know, if you want me to take
over, just-just let me know.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.486
No, I'm fine.
Think I got the drone covered.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.655
Are you sure? 'Cause,
you know, how about...

32:36.688 --> 32:38.757
you just let me know whenever
you want me to take over, okay?

32:38.790 --> 32:41.660
Well, maybe when you, uh,
can fly one of these things

32:41.693 --> 32:43.229
in the bullpen
without crashing,

32:43.262 --> 32:44.330
we'll talk about it.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.498
I think we need to stay focused.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.369
KENSI:
We got a problem.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.571
I'm all ears.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.006
We think
Amanda's missing.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.341
Her mom woke up
and she was gone.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.509
All right, stand by.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.445
I'll call Callen and Sam.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.750
No.
Thanks.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.785
Isaac says Amanda
hasn't been back.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.420
Maybe she did know
Gavin and Carson.

33:08.454 --> 33:09.355
She could be
helping them.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.589
She lied to us before.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.191
Did you find the map
of the old wells?

33:12.224 --> 33:14.226
Not yet.
Don't hold
your breath.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.794
There's no diagram of
their exact location.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.563
Well, it was the 1920s.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.432
NELL: Right, it's not like they
could scan and digitize them.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.734
The map's probably rotting away
somewhere in a giant warehouse

33:22.768 --> 33:24.636
right next to the
Ark of the Covenant.

33:26.672 --> 33:30.542
Eric, incoming.

33:30.576 --> 33:31.510
ERIC:
Are you kidding me?

33:31.543 --> 33:33.412
NELL: Oh, looks like
the map of your dreams.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.380
ERIC:
Oh, where'd you get this?

33:34.413 --> 33:36.582
My college friend works
at the L.A. Library.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.217
It was on microfiche.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.253
Microfiche. That's like
finding it on a cave painting.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.589
NELL: Okay, so,
according to this,

33:43.622 --> 33:46.658
I believe I'm flying over
an old oil well site

33:46.692 --> 33:48.594
now near the last solar job.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.430
MOSLEY:
All right, zoom in.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.665
NELL:
Okay. Got it.

33:53.699 --> 33:55.467
That's their truck.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.835
With a tank in the back.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.803
God.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.273
MOSLEY:
Now switch to thermal imaging.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.175
Thermal imaging? What
else does this drone do?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.276
NELL:
Oh, you know,

34:04.310 --> 34:05.811
3D mapping to
one centimeter,

34:05.844 --> 34:07.746
facial rec
from 1,500 feet.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.181
I think I'm in love.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.582
All right,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.451
I've got an empty house,

34:12.484 --> 34:15.454
but three warm bodies
in a detached garage.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.622
Send in the cavalry.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.358
MAN: All right,
ease it back.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.600
Sam and I will breach,
you two cover.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.068
Copy that.

34:33.872 --> 34:36.242
Drone saw a skylight
on the right.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.343
Maybe there's a window.

34:40.812 --> 34:41.680
HIDOKO:
We've got a ladder.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.614
Go.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.465
Federal agents!

34:59.498 --> 35:00.632
Hands on your head.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.603
That would not
be a good idea.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.505
Drop everything now.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.574
If you want to
be burnt alive.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.509
Dead man's switch.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.344
Ah, correct.

35:12.378 --> 35:14.513
I can tell this isn't
your first barbecue.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.481
Oh, you're very funny.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.815
Some just can't

35:16.848 --> 35:18.584
appreciate gallows humor.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.418
Don't move.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.621
Carson, what happens
if they shoot?

35:22.654 --> 35:25.491
Joystick pops back,
lights the fuse;

35:25.524 --> 35:27.226
the rocket engine
ignites the napalm;

35:27.259 --> 35:29.295
burns through the well cap
down to the gas field.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.330
Creating four miles
of devastation.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.564
You've done
your homework.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.932
We have.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.634
KENSI:
Guys, stall for a minute.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.670
Why are you doing this?

35:38.704 --> 35:40.539
To save the planet.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.608
Sounds to me like
you're destroying it.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.943
If we wipe out L.A.'s
natural gas supply,

35:44.976 --> 35:47.546
they'll have to convert
to solar and wind.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.315
Thousands of people will die.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.617
It's less demand
for natural resources.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.352
It's called
thinning the herd.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.254
You can't get
away with this.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.556
We knew that was a possibility.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.359
That's why we're staying here.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.860
We'll die as martyrs.

36:01.893 --> 36:04.430
Inspiring others to take action.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.565
What's she doing here?

36:08.267 --> 36:09.735
GAVIN: Zack told her
about our plans.

36:09.768 --> 36:12.404
She obviously
tipped you guys off.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.873
Zack never told her anything.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.476
She didn't even know
about the napalm.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.246
Look, let's let her go.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.447
Okay?

36:21.480 --> 36:23.715
She'll stay here
and die with us.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.784
Let's go.

36:25.817 --> 36:29.221
Check to see if the
guide wire's tightened.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.589
KENSI:
Take them out on my count.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.424
W

36:32.458 --> 36:34.260
Ah. My insurance policy.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.927
In case you were smart enough
to find us.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.429
KENSI: We know about
the dead man's switch.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.664
If you're on board, say "okay."

36:38.697 --> 36:39.631
Okay.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.666
Okay, what?

36:40.699 --> 36:42.401
KENSI:
Three...

36:42.434 --> 36:43.569
two...

36:43.602 --> 36:45.471
CARSON: I'm lighting it!
KENSI: ...one.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.649
Shut it off.
Shut it off!

37:01.587 --> 37:03.689
You boys okay?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.857
We're good.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.793
You doused the rocket
and capped the hole.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.895
The napalm can't ignite.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.367
Amanda, are you
all right?

37:15.401 --> 37:18.270
Take that out.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.576
I thought I was gonna die.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.278
Not on our watch.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.347
Slow down.
Slow down and breathe.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.881
All my fault.
No.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.617
You were an innocent bystander.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.385
They're the bad guys.
It's their fault.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.388
I can't stop shaking.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.727
Okay. You got through this,
you can get through anything.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.729
It only gets better.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.696
:
Thank you.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.865
Yeah. Okay.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.834
Thank you.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.643
Oh, you boys clean up nice.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.911
I had to say good-bye to my
very favorite pair of boots.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.079
Aw.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.681
These are keepers.

38:02.714 --> 38:03.649
Cement shoes.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.518
Mess with your boat,
sleep with the fishes.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.553
Where's Hidoko?

38:07.586 --> 38:09.521
KENSI:
Oh, well, Hidoko

38:09.555 --> 38:11.423
went to a spinning class
because she is literally

38:11.457 --> 38:12.558
the Energizer Bunny.

38:12.591 --> 38:13.992
Wow, must have been an easy day

38:14.025 --> 38:15.427
if you guys
are already chillin'.

38:15.461 --> 38:16.562
Did you crack that case?

38:16.595 --> 38:18.464
We did.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.531
How'd you find the napalm?

38:21.733 --> 38:23.635
It's actually a long story,
so why don't you just tell us

38:23.669 --> 38:24.803
how your active shooter
training went?

38:24.836 --> 38:28.006
Amazing, you know,
rigorous, brutal.

38:28.039 --> 38:31.109
Yeah, those laser tag
things can be tough.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.378
Oh, no, I was wrong.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.379
Wasn't a video game at all.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.682
Went to this, um, uh,
abandoned shopping mall.

38:36.715 --> 38:37.816
It was pitch-black; we breached

38:37.849 --> 38:40.752
in a stack and then we
got lit up by all the bad guys,

38:40.786 --> 38:42.688
ambushed with
the semi-automatic sims.

38:42.721 --> 38:43.889
Check it.
SAM: Wow, ow.

38:43.922 --> 38:44.990
Oh, my gosh.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.792
Airsoft pellet
contusions.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.794
It stings even more when I flex.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.662
Airsoft.

38:50.696 --> 38:51.730
I can't even imagine.
Hmm.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.865
KENSI:
Ibuprofen?

38:53.899 --> 38:54.800
I love you.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.668
So, you solved
your case,

38:56.702 --> 38:57.603
but did you
solve the mystery

38:57.636 --> 39:00.105
of the man pushing his
car up to the hotel?

39:00.138 --> 39:01.773
You know what,
we were talking about that

39:01.807 --> 39:02.808
all day.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.809
Did you really?
Mm-hmm.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.976
You have any more questions?

39:05.010 --> 39:07.679
Yeah, um, was the guy
driving a race car

39:07.713 --> 39:10.449
about, oh, that big?

39:10.482 --> 39:12.117
Yes, he was.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.786
And was the hotel red,
and made of plastic?

39:14.820 --> 39:16.988
Yes, it was.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.256
He was playing Monopoly.

39:18.289 --> 39:21.793
He pushed the car to the hotel
on Boardwalk and went bankrupt.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.829
I am not gonna lie,
I'm very impressed right now.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.063
And this is what
I was talking about,

39:25.096 --> 39:27.799
it's a team coming together,
using their powers of deduction.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.435
Nice work.
How long did it take ya?

39:29.468 --> 39:30.536
I don't know,

39:30.569 --> 39:32.838
.087 seconds, I think.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.606
Yeah. We googled it.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.775
You googled it?

39:36.808 --> 39:38.076
You cheated?

39:38.109 --> 39:39.445
You took the shortcut.

39:39.478 --> 39:40.879
You know what,
this is what's wrong

39:40.912 --> 39:41.947
with your whole generation.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.683
Every great investigation
starts with the Internet.

39:44.716 --> 39:45.584
It's okay.
How 'bout this?

39:45.617 --> 39:46.485
How 'bout I just give you
another one.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.787
How about we take you out
for a drink

39:48.820 --> 39:49.821
so you can nurse those wounds.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.790
Beer, shuffleboard at Boomtown?

39:51.823 --> 39:53.625
Actually, that sounds
much more fun.

39:53.659 --> 39:54.893
Awesome.

39:58.229 --> 40:00.799
What do you think about
inviting Mosley?

40:00.832 --> 40:03.001
Mm, she looks busy to me.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.169
Well, she did good today.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.838
The drone, microfiche.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.039
Maybe next time.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.407
You coming?

40:10.942 --> 40:12.010
I'll meet you there.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.845
All right,
we're taking the Audi.

40:13.879 --> 40:14.880
Shotgun!

40:14.913 --> 40:15.847
I'm picking the music.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.415
I'm picking the earplugs.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.829
Kam...

40:30.862 --> 40:34.099
No, I'm just calling
to say hello.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.934
And...

40:35.967 --> 40:38.637
You know you can call me
to talk anytime, right?

40:38.670 --> 40:39.971
You know that, right?

40:41.907 --> 40:44.910
Yeah, even when
I'm shooting at the bad guys.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.914
No, it's not a problem,
we could still talk.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.717
I would put you
on speakerphone.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.752
