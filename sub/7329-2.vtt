00:06.407 --> 00:09.653
# My girl's ready
to take control #

00:09.677 --> 00:11.521
# She just blows my mind #

00:11.545 --> 00:15.926
# She only listens
to the radio #

00:15.950 --> 00:17.727
# To see who's alive #

00:17.751 --> 00:19.629
# They said,
hey, there, girl... #

00:19.653 --> 00:21.231
You're under arrest!

00:21.255 --> 00:23.780
You bad, bad boy...

01:04.297 --> 01:07.176
Morning, Agent Fillmore.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.277
Ten-hut.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.512
Like the Army greens.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.581
We do investigate crimes
of the Navy here, though.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.851
Nice smile. Good thing I have
a strong ego, or I'd think

01:14.875 --> 01:16.775
you didn't like me.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.122
What?

01:19.146 --> 01:20.723
Ziva... did she call?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.625
You haven't spoken
to her either, huh?

01:22.649 --> 01:24.961
Tried talking to her
on the plane, but, uh...

01:24.985 --> 01:26.129
I don't know.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.331
Things got...

01:28.355 --> 01:30.733
These details are classified.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.019
Thank you.

01:33.393 --> 01:34.937
- No, they're not.
- They should be.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.272
What's going on
around here anyway?

01:36.296 --> 01:37.640
I had to sign an autograph
going through security.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.075
I know what you mean.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.943
You know Janice
in Psych Services?

01:40.967 --> 01:42.378
Man hands? Great eyes.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.580
Yeah. She asked me out
for drinks tomorrow night.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.949
That's not bad for a guy
who spent half the last mission

01:46.973 --> 01:48.317
- sleeping on the floor.
- Was not sleeping

01:48.341 --> 01:49.886
- on the floor.
- Could have fooled me.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.287
She'll call when she's ready.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.422
Last time I said that,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.457
I ended up tied
to a chair in North Africa.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.992
She's coming back, right?

01:56.016 --> 01:57.994
Ah, she's coming back.

01:58.018 --> 02:00.620
Course I don't know
where she's gonna sit.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.334
20 bucks says that desk gonna be
empty by the end of next month.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.602
Hate to disappoint you.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.150
My letter of resignation.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.074
Well, that's, uh, very long.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.676
I had a hard time
choosing the right adjectives.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.478
I couldn't decide
between "childish,"

02:15.502 --> 02:18.335
"juvenile," and just
plain old "annoying."

02:19.439 --> 02:20.483
It's true.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.618
And you... you know better,

02:22.642 --> 02:24.420
but you're so busy
playing the faithful sidekick,

02:24.444 --> 02:25.955
you just go along for the ride.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.023
Well, I've had enough.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.616
Make sure that
Agent Gibbs gets that.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.983
- Annoying?
- Sidekick?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.134
Hello, Gibbs.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.103
Your door was open.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.594
Usually is.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.842
I, uh, apologize for being late.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.044
The Navy lodge I was staying
at ran a surprise drill

02:48.068 --> 02:51.047
this morning, so I just...

02:51.071 --> 02:53.665
It's not important.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.375
How are you?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.958
I am fine... Gibbs.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.960
That is what I wished

03:03.984 --> 03:06.629
to speak to you about,
among other things.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.865
First of all, I...

03:08.889 --> 03:11.634
wanted to say...

03:11.658 --> 03:13.803
thank you.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.740
Which hardly seems sufficient.

03:17.764 --> 03:21.244
Considering so, I...
It just called, um...

03:21.268 --> 03:23.079
It's an old Buck mortise chisel.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.480
That is not for rescuing me.

03:24.504 --> 03:26.048
That is for leaving me
in Israel.

03:26.072 --> 03:28.584
You're probably wondering,

03:28.608 --> 03:31.020
perhaps I rigged it
to explode...

03:31.044 --> 03:32.655
No.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.147
I was thinking
this is a really nice chisel.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.397
When, uh...

03:41.421 --> 03:43.199
you left me in Israel,

03:43.223 --> 03:46.556
I... I felt betrayed.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.808
But I...

03:51.832 --> 03:54.744
I had a long time
to think about things.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.013
Very, very, very

03:57.037 --> 03:59.028
long time.

04:01.975 --> 04:04.587
And you were right
to leave me there.

04:04.611 --> 04:05.888
I know.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.312
Well, the point is,
now I do, too.

04:10.116 --> 04:14.297
I had forgotten
who I could trust.

04:14.321 --> 04:18.257
We were a team,
and I would like that again.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.106
You need to talk
to the director.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.791
It is your blessing I came for.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.017
Yeah.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.252
DiNozzo, what do you got?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.654
Uh-huh. Where?

04:38.678 --> 04:40.669
Meet you there.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.726
Triple homicide.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.662
You need to talk to Leon Vance.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.018
I already told him
to expect you.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.654
And he's not the only one
you need to talk to.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.985
Hey, you missed a shot
there, sidekick.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.253
I'm not your sidekick, Tony.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.388
And yet, you are.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.024
No, I am not,
because you're not the boss.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.692
When Gibbs isn't here,
I'm the boss.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.794
Gibbs is here.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.996
Hey, boss.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.998
Uh, Marine Staff Sergeant
Jeff Ross.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.866
He's the one
who booked the room.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.768
Said it was for
a buddy's bachelor party.

05:25.792 --> 05:26.936
Local LEOs identified him.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.104
Then they called us.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.305
Haven't identified
the other two yet.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.506
Still waiting on the Duck Man.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.975
Who found him?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.210
That would be the stripper.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.202
She's in the next room
with her manager.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.298
Where is Fillmore?

05:49.249 --> 05:52.395
Finally. I've been here
since 3:00 a.m.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.797
You have some place else
you have to be?

05:54.821 --> 05:56.299
Not me, but her.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.067
Scorpio's my best dancer.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.735
Listen, I got here
as soon as I heard.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.671
Hector Stuckey.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.424
I'm in show biz.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.316
Okay... let me hear it.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.350
Start at the beginning.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.651
Take your time.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.153
Uh, Hector gave me the address.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.256
These guys regular customers?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.257
No. First-timers.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.325
I do a lot of business here.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.726
I got a deal with the hotel.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.019
Look.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.532
My own cologne.
It's got my number.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.599
Keep it.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.101
Yeah, it's okay. I'm gonna pass.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.103
I... I met with him

06:34.127 --> 06:36.706
in the lobby in the afternoon.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.076
He said he wanted
to surprise his friends, so...

06:40.100 --> 06:42.125
so he gave me a key.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.915
I came in through that door

06:45.939 --> 06:48.117
and spotted them
the way they are now,

06:48.141 --> 06:49.476
except...

06:52.879 --> 06:54.369
Except what?

06:56.783 --> 06:59.684
I'm pretty sure he had hair
when I first met him.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.251
Take it off.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.442
Yeah.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.877
Duck?

07:14.901 --> 07:18.147
Even the sharpest of razors,
on a-on a shave this close

07:18.171 --> 07:22.151
would cause pseudofolliculitis
barbae, aka...

07:22.175 --> 07:23.152
Razor burn.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.320
Yeah.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.621
However,

07:25.645 --> 07:28.657
note the complete lack
of dermabrasive disruption.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.660
Whoever did this did so

07:31.684 --> 07:33.879
after they were dead.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.541
Bachelor number one is
Marine Staff Sergeant Jeff Ross,

07:45.565 --> 07:48.911
a mechanic on leave
from Camp Muchuk in South Korea.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.881
Eric Jurel, a civilian.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.884
Runs an auctioneering
school in D.C.

07:54.908 --> 07:55.952
Guest of honor:

07:55.976 --> 07:58.654
Alan Sandich,
a low-level file clerk

07:58.678 --> 07:59.822
at the Pentagon.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.390
Talk to the fiancÃ©e?

08:01.414 --> 08:02.825
Uh, she's out of town,

08:02.849 --> 08:05.185
but we are working
on getting a hold of her now.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.798
No criminal records

08:08.822 --> 08:10.266
across the board,
unless you count

08:10.290 --> 08:12.835
egging a church
freshman year of high school.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.071
These guys have known
each other for a while.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.039
Why would you egg a church?

08:17.063 --> 08:18.875
Find out.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.476
You got it, boss.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.012
Tony, let's go.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.247
Follow me.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.148
No, no, no. You follow me.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.184
Don't fight
your inner sidekick, McGee.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.352
It's unbecoming.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.387
I could say
the same thing to you.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.456
No, you can't because

08:33.480 --> 08:36.025
everyone knows that sidekicks
are shorter, and you...

08:36.049 --> 08:38.039
Are exactly
the same height as you.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.834
Look, you're not gonna
make me say it, are you?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.436
You think you're too
good-looking to be the sidekick?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.138
No. People think
I'm too good-looking.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.840
Specifically, the women people.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.855
Actually, I find McGee
to be the more handsome.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.479
Nothing personal.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.980
Hi.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.016
Hello.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.184
So, what are you doing here?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.972
David... with me.

09:06.646 --> 09:07.957
That answers that question.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.778
I have to go.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.361
Agent Gibbs already briefed me.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.596
You want back.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.498
Is that right?

09:15.522 --> 09:16.832
That is correct.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.687
Have you discussed this
with your father?

09:20.694 --> 09:24.130
I am not sure
how his opinion is relevant.

09:25.131 --> 09:26.375
We rescued you.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.411
Not Mossad, not your father.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.446
I think it would be
very relevant.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.815
Have I not been
a valuable asset to NCIS?

09:32.839 --> 09:34.350
Without question.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.618
Then what is the problem?

09:35.642 --> 09:37.186
David, you were never an agent.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.755
You were the Mossad
liaison officer,

09:39.779 --> 09:41.357
which, by definition,
requires you

09:41.381 --> 09:43.259
to have a relationship
with Mossad.

09:43.283 --> 09:47.063
Have you even spoken
to your father?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.952
No.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.668
You're damaged goods.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.104
How damaged I need to know

09:55.128 --> 09:57.961
before I can even begin to
figure out what to do with you.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.891
You pass a psych evaluation
battery, and we'll talk.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.382
Thank you.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.917
David.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.774
No promises.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.424
The auction chant...

10:15.448 --> 10:17.693
to most of the public,
it's gibberish.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.596
But it's actually
carefully crafted to avoid

10:20.620 --> 10:22.922
giving people time to think.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.036
Thoughtful people spend less,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.972
and spending is the name
of the proverbial game.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.140
Any questions?

10:31.164 --> 10:32.608
Yeah. I have some.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.411
I have a question, as well.

10:35.435 --> 10:39.098
Break down into teams of two
and practice.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.252
Is this about Eric Jurel?

10:43.276 --> 10:44.620
I already heard.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.489
Good news travels fast.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.590
Good news?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.091
Well, he's dead, isn't he?

10:49.115 --> 10:51.927
Did you wake up this morning
wanting to be the prime suspect

10:51.951 --> 10:53.195
in a murder investigation?

10:53.219 --> 10:55.865
If wishing Eric Jurel dead
makes me a suspect,

10:55.889 --> 10:59.001
then so is every employee
of this auction school.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.071
Eric took pleasure
in making others miserable.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.689
No one is shedding any tears
for that man.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.511
You sure about that?

11:08.535 --> 11:12.581
Ugh, that's Elaina,
our miscellaneous items broker.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.483
She could sell sand to a Bedouin

11:14.507 --> 11:17.486
and then bore him to death
about her latest crush.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.687
Pay her no heed.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.189
It's our job to heed.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.625
You agreed
to the purchase price.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.428
Fine, if you don't want it,
I know 20 people who will

11:25.452 --> 11:28.388
and a lawyer
who will have your head.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.534
Can I help you?

11:31.558 --> 11:33.002
Yes, um,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.472
we'd like to ask you a few
questions about your boss.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.840
You're Elaina, right?

11:37.864 --> 11:40.643
I assume you've heard the news?

11:40.667 --> 11:42.411
Yes.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.680
It's terrible.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.817
Were you two...

11:47.841 --> 11:49.819
No.

11:49.843 --> 11:53.279
I mean, I was...

11:54.881 --> 11:56.508
He wasn't...

11:58.084 --> 11:59.361
No, we weren't.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.297
You know, it's not that
there wasn't a spark.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.119
It's just that he...

12:05.325 --> 12:06.735
Any reason that you can think of

12:06.759 --> 12:08.039
why someone would want him dead?

12:09.629 --> 12:12.575
Well, a lot of people
misunderstood him.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.978
But Eric was a good man,
deep down.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.872
I can't see anyone
wanting to hurt him.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.050
But...

12:21.074 --> 12:22.074
But what?

12:24.244 --> 12:28.023
I... overheard him...

12:28.047 --> 12:30.259
on the phone in the office.

12:30.283 --> 12:34.413
That he said he thought
someone was following him.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.033
I have never been
to a bachelor party.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.201
Really?

12:39.225 --> 12:40.369
How sad.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.071
Well, I've been invited.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.572
It's just, one time I was sick

12:43.596 --> 12:46.075
and then another time
I had a, uh, broken leg.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.411
Well, I could tell you stories
that would make your hair curl.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.347
- Well, go on.
- No.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.848
- It's better he doesn't. Duck.
- Oh, Jethro.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.284
Can't I tell him
about the time when...

12:55.308 --> 12:57.219
Better I don't.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.755
Uh, I called you down here
because liver pathology

12:59.779 --> 13:03.392
suggested... and Abby
later confirmed...

13:03.416 --> 13:05.961
that all three men were drugged
prior to their deaths.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.263
The champagne.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.300
And while semi-conscious,
one was drowned,

13:11.324 --> 13:15.604
one suffocated,
and Sergeant Ross here

13:15.628 --> 13:18.607
died of a massive
alcohol poisoning.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.810
Likely ingested under duress.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.479
Semi-conscious?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.481
Very astute, Jethro.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.550
- The killer...
- Wanted them

13:27.574 --> 13:29.885
awake when they died.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.520
Which implies a deeper meaning

13:31.544 --> 13:33.656
to the ritualistic manner
of their deaths.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.926
Mr. Palmer here
discovered something.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.962
I found an inconsistency
in Ross's military file.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.997
The record states
that he sustained an injury

13:42.021 --> 13:43.599
during a work-related accident

13:43.623 --> 13:45.734
on base in Korea,
but Dr. Mallard

13:45.758 --> 13:48.871
found evidence
of a gunshot wound.

13:48.895 --> 13:53.642
Not something I'd expect to see
in a work-related injury.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.911
Falsified the report.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.835
It's a good assumption.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.369
Hey, boss.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.072
Uh, ATM and traffic cameras...

14:23.096 --> 14:24.940
we got a tip
that one of our victims

14:24.964 --> 14:26.642
was, uh, being followed.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.577
Thought I'd check on
some of the routes he was on.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.379
See if we could find out
who the tail was.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.680
Yeah, the swiping thing was...

14:31.704 --> 14:33.849
Need to talk to
Sergeant Ross's C.O.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.150
- in South Korea.
- I'll set it up and...

14:35.174 --> 14:36.619
- Where's DiNozzo?
- On an interview.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.687
Alan Sandich's fiancÃ©e's
back in town.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.856
And she's already reengaged.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.291
Does it remind you
of anyone, boss?

14:42.315 --> 14:44.627
How long are you gonna keep
making those jokes, DiNozzo?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.262
I think that was
actually the last time

14:46.286 --> 14:47.529
I'm ever gonna make that joke.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.231
Sorry.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.232
She's engaged already?

14:50.256 --> 14:52.534
It's only been 24 hours.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.535
Not exactly.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.559
Check this out.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.678
Wow.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.747
That's illegal in most states.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.549
There's parts of Europe
you can...

15:07.573 --> 15:08.741
It's bad behavior.

15:09.876 --> 15:11.053
This is from Sandich's
bachelor party.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.271
Turn it off.

15:15.281 --> 15:18.427
Yeah, it's his real
bachelor party.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.561
Five months ago.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.063
When Sandich's fiancÃ©e

15:21.087 --> 15:22.531
found the tape,
she called off the engagement.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.033
She hasn't seen him since.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.501
Which means...

15:25.525 --> 15:27.403
They were all still single.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.338
Second bachelor party
was just a cover.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.353
Cover for what?

15:40.139 --> 15:42.384
I've heard of a cover
story for a bachelor party,

15:42.408 --> 15:45.487
but I've never heard of one
being the cover story.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.990
What do you think
they were really up to?

15:48.014 --> 15:49.558
The usual.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.947
No good.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.131
Any luck on whoever's
following Eric Jurel,

15:56.155 --> 15:57.266
our auction house owner?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.768
No, and it was over a week ago.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.137
Could try to recreate
your victim's daily route

16:02.161 --> 16:04.640
by using his cell's GPS history.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.110
Then see if there are any other
cell phones consistently

16:08.134 --> 16:09.278
in the same area.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.412
If so...

16:10.436 --> 16:11.947
We've got Jurel's tail.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.816
I'm sorry.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.617
I overheard you two talking.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.153
No, thank you, 'cause
that is extremely helpful.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.873
I mean, we can pull the GPS
history and look at the logs.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.829
And I'm gonna go do that

16:26.853 --> 16:30.755
after I get a Nutter Butter.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.906
Taking the tour?

16:37.930 --> 16:41.510
I have my first
psych evaluation.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.245
Oh, yeah, I always love those.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.646
I'm sure.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.672
You get to talk about
yourself the entire time.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.251
I'm sorry, I meant, um...

16:49.275 --> 16:51.754
No, no, no, that's okay.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.042
No one's ever accused you
of having tact.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.283
Sorry.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.462
Sorry, I gotta take this.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.264
It's work.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.365
DiNozzo.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.099
Listen, I've got...

17:05.124 --> 17:06.853
For you.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.305
Hello.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.340
Ziva, you said you were
coming down to the lab.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.342
Yes, sorry, Abby.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.444
- I know I said I would.
- Come now.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.232
All right, I will be right down.

17:20.138 --> 17:23.117
Haven't had your private
Abby welcome yet, huh?

17:23.142 --> 17:25.521
Careful, she might
give you a 21-gun salute.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.891
I will, um...

17:28.915 --> 17:31.160
see you later.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.378
I will be right here.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.654
Hello, Abby.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.348
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

17:53.372 --> 17:54.583
How could you have doubted Tony

17:54.607 --> 17:56.218
after everything you've
been through together?

17:56.242 --> 17:58.420
You really think
that Tony killed Rivkin

17:58.444 --> 17:59.755
because he was jealous?

17:59.779 --> 18:02.090
- Abby, please calm...
- You weren't thinking.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.525
That's right.
You weren't thinking.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.160
Although I suppose
I could understand

18:05.184 --> 18:06.962
your initial reaction.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.866
You were in an emotional time
for you, and people act rashly.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.368
But to tell Gibbs
that you didn't trust Tony?!

18:13.392 --> 18:16.572
Which I guess I also could
understand, you know.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.607
I mean, he did just
shoot your boyfriend.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.209
In your living room.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.977
To death.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.412
All right,
I'll give you that one.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.447
But this is Tony
we're talking about here!

18:25.471 --> 18:27.382
All... all soft and goofy
on the outside

18:27.406 --> 18:29.351
and 100% rock on the inside.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.786
And after everything
you accused him of,

18:30.810 --> 18:33.188
he risked his life
to go save you!

18:33.212 --> 18:35.257
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

18:35.281 --> 18:36.892
Even though, in hindsight,

18:36.916 --> 18:38.794
it is starting to make
a little bit more sense now.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.597
But either way,
the ball is in your court.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.399
It is Tony one and Ziva zilch.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.901
This is your move.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.688
And it better be a good one.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.498
God, I was so worried about you.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.929
I know.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.755
Nice to speak to you
in person, Agent Gibbs.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.991
I'm sure I'm not the first
to say, "ooh-rah."

19:09.015 --> 19:11.484
Quite a feat your team
pulled off in North Africa.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.230
Love to hear the details.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.666
Come on, Gunny.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.135
We don't get a lot of action
in South Korea.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.252
Sergeant Ross... you know him?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.307
He's a good man.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.409
How can I help?

19:27.433 --> 19:30.078
Accident report you signed
said he hurt himself on base?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.713
He was a flight mechanic.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.248
Got his arm
caught in a hydraulic.

19:33.272 --> 19:34.783
Really?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.852
My M.E. here says
it was a gunshot wound.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.954
He's pretty smart.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.156
You care to revise your report?

19:41.180 --> 19:44.326
Guess I have to.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.395
Starting with the fact
Ross was actually

19:46.419 --> 19:47.930
the biggest bastard
I'd ever met.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.831
Why would you falsify a report?

19:49.855 --> 19:52.267
Was trying to avoid
an international incident.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.902
Ross took two days of leave.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.537
Said he was visiting
his girl in Seoul.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.839
When he came back,
he'd been shot.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.174
Husband?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.276
That's what he said.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.512
I gave him a verbal reprimand
and buried it.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.881
Geopolitics here are dicey.

20:05.905 --> 20:09.217
Not gonna win hearts and minds
going after another man's tail.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.286
I'm gonna need a revised report.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.689
I'll have it on your desk
at 0800 tomorrow.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.191
I got something for you to sign.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.526
Ziva's reinstatement.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.095
She passed her first psych eval?

20:20.119 --> 20:21.964
She didn't fail;
Let's put it that way.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.199
Saleem's men put
a world of hurt on her,

20:24.223 --> 20:25.701
but I think she's viable.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.870
What's Eli David think?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.807
I got some details to work out.

20:31.831 --> 20:35.310
Not gonna try
if you don't want her.

20:35.334 --> 20:38.347
Or were you hoping that I
couldn't work out the details

20:38.371 --> 20:40.549
so you wouldn't even
have to make that call?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.851
I already told you, Leon.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.219
We need Ziva.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.906
Yeah... I remember.

20:49.749 --> 20:54.209
Well, that should
make it easy for you.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.334
Sergeant Ross went MIA during
a two-day leave last month.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.369
Find out where he went.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.503
In South Korea?

21:01.527 --> 21:04.706
Okay, I'll just
make some phone calls.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.208
Order me some Berlitz CDs.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.010
Hey, boss, I think
we've got a way to find out

21:08.034 --> 21:09.611
who was tailing Jurel,
the auction house guy.

21:09.635 --> 21:13.015
The red line was Jurel's
daily drive before he died.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.950
We're looking for cell signals
that were shadowing him.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.339
It was actually Ziva's idea.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.588
We weren't discussing the case.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.024
She just walked by.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.059
I got a hit.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.228
It's a cell phone.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.530
Shows up close
to Jurel's car several times.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.798
You got a name?

21:29.822 --> 21:31.400
That is odd.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.035
Well, cell doesn't have
a valid ESN number.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.436
It's not registered
with any carrier.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.937
Could be black market.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.706
It's a burn phone, Tim.
Just say burn phone.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.107
Can you trace it?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.251
I can do better than that;
I can take you right to it.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.374
It's inside.

21:53.379 --> 21:56.280
With me, McGee.

21:58.284 --> 22:00.729
In position.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.531
On my mark.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.749
Go.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.268
Baltimore Police.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.836
Got two suspects.

22:07.860 --> 22:08.860
NCIS.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.373
Shots fired.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.058
Partner's got one suspect
in the alley.

22:14.700 --> 22:15.711
DiNozzo.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.512
Gibbs.

22:17.536 --> 22:19.715
Shelley.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.859
Guessing he's in charge now.

22:22.742 --> 22:23.868
Good guess.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.226
Is Friendly still on the force?

22:31.250 --> 22:33.628
Retired last year.

22:33.652 --> 22:36.198
DiNozzo...
Wait, are you Tony DiNozzo?

22:36.222 --> 22:37.699
Only if I don't owe you money.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.267
You don't.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.759
Just glad to have you
at my back, sir.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.833
Clear.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.379
Clear.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.815
Jurel's tail was here.
He's gone now.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.484
This guy...

22:55.508 --> 22:57.635
Officer Shelley?

22:59.779 --> 23:02.348
It's locked.

23:13.459 --> 23:15.704
There's nothing in back.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.705
Alley was empty.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.607
Couldn't find the partner.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.155
That's because
he was never here.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.359
This is Shelley's house.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.924
There are three men murdered

23:35.948 --> 23:37.025
at a fake bachelor party.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.360
What were they
really doing there?

23:38.384 --> 23:40.061
No one knows.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.631
This is definitely the cell
that was tailing Jurel.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.099
If Shelley was working a case,

23:44.123 --> 23:45.534
Baltimore PD
doesn't know about it.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.259
Still, no one knows.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.071
What we do know is

23:50.095 --> 23:51.740
that Shelley
was tailing the victims.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.909
Uh, found those under his bed.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.211
Not tailing... targeting.

23:56.235 --> 23:58.246
Spending a lot of time
at airports.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.681
Well, there's nothing useful
on the cell itself,

23:59.705 --> 24:01.817
but the model retails
for over a grand.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.152
Yeah, that's not bad
on a cop's salary.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.543
We found this on his computer.

24:10.482 --> 24:12.260
- Suicide note.
- Rambling.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.830
Says, uh, he's sorry;
Doesn't say why.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.299
We interrupted the second half
of a murder-suicide?

24:17.323 --> 24:19.167
Well, let's not hang around
and find out. DiNozzo.

24:19.191 --> 24:22.838
I will, uh, contact my buddies
at the Baltimore PD,

24:22.862 --> 24:24.606
- see if they know where Shelley was headed.
- McGee.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.107
I'll look into
Shelley's background,

24:26.131 --> 24:28.412
see if there's any connection
between him and the victims.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.197
Thanks.

24:42.681 --> 24:44.649
Hey.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.129
McGee.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.632
You taking a break?

24:50.656 --> 24:52.033
I was on my way to the office,

24:52.057 --> 24:53.869
came to get a coffee,
saw you sitting here,

24:53.893 --> 24:55.087
thought I'd come say hello.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.653
I was actually coming
to look for you.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.877
I wanted to say...

25:01.901 --> 25:04.597
thank you.

25:07.640 --> 25:11.519
Did you come to the navy yard
just to say thanks or?

25:11.543 --> 25:14.823
I am, uh, finishing my psych
evaluation with

25:14.847 --> 25:17.859
Dr. Bracco today.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.861
Janice Bracco, with the?

25:19.885 --> 25:24.032
Man hands
and the pretty eyes, yes.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.033
Why?

25:25.057 --> 25:27.252
Um, nothing, no.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.957
So how's it going?

25:36.835 --> 25:38.847
I will not deny

25:38.871 --> 25:40.862
these past three months
have been...

25:43.809 --> 25:46.254
a challenge.

25:46.278 --> 25:50.759
But that was all in the past,
and the past is the past.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.751
Is it?

25:54.787 --> 25:57.756
Yes.

25:59.758 --> 26:02.226
So why are you avoiding Tony?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.845
Hey, boss,
when did you get back?

26:10.869 --> 26:12.614
Ten minutes ago.

26:12.638 --> 26:13.615
Just, uh, taking a...

26:13.639 --> 26:14.799
Coffee break?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.185
Yeah.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.286
Hey, I found a connection

26:18.310 --> 26:19.554
between Officer Shelley
and our dead guys.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.189
They went to
the same high school.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.578
Yeah, how'd you know?

26:23.749 --> 26:25.760
Uh, there is more.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.495
The records say
that our dead guys

26:27.519 --> 26:28.697
had a history of bullying.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.698
Shelley was
their favorite target.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.733
Mm, they brutalized him.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.901
Gives us motive,

26:32.925 --> 26:34.769
assuming that he held a grudge
all these years.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.504
And if he didn't,
it recently got a refresh,

26:36.528 --> 26:38.440
and I'm going to explain that
after I hit the head.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.375
DiNozzo.

26:40.399 --> 26:41.400
It can wait.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.645
I spoke to a buddy
from Homicide,

26:43.669 --> 26:45.747
and he said that Shelley
pulled over Sergeant Ross

26:45.771 --> 26:48.350
about a month ago
and gave him a ticket,

26:48.374 --> 26:50.051
and then ended up
giving him three tickets

26:50.075 --> 26:52.721
once he realized it was his
old high school tormentor.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.189
Oh, I bet that felt good.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.957
You would think that.

26:55.981 --> 26:57.025
Fun didn't last long.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.329
Why don't you check your e-mail.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.464
Ross got payback.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.932
E-mailed an old
high school video

27:03.956 --> 27:06.117
of Shelley to everyone
in Shelley's precinct.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.970
Turn that off! Turn that off!

27:08.994 --> 27:10.994
Not the sort of thing
you want your buddies to see.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.167
Oh, yeah.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.214
Hold on.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.949
Smile for the camera, baby.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.650
He looks like a monk.

27:22.674 --> 27:23.952
I've seen that before.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.387
Yeah, at our murder scene.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.821
Boss, I think Shelley
was recreating

27:26.845 --> 27:28.390
incidents from his past.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.725
Look at our dead guy
with the head in the toilet.

27:30.749 --> 27:31.960
- Toilet.
- Was a weekly occurrence

27:31.984 --> 27:33.061
for Shelley.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.096
Jurel and his buddies at prom

27:35.120 --> 27:38.666
forced Shelley to drink until he
got sick, same as Sergeant Ross.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.336
But their favorite pastime
was stuffing Shelley's head

27:41.360 --> 27:42.670
into his backpack.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.806
Yeah, I'd say.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.975
Shelley held a grudge
all these years.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.777
- We got motive.
- And opportunity.

27:48.801 --> 27:49.911
Be nice to have Shelley.

27:49.935 --> 27:50.945
McGee,

27:50.969 --> 27:52.903
- bank statements, credit cards.
- Yeah.

27:59.478 --> 28:01.489
DiNozzo.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.590
Yes, boss?

28:02.614 --> 28:04.426
- Shake it.
- Thank you, boss.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.281
Oh, God.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.664
# Which my father bought #

28:09.688 --> 28:13.101
# For two zuzim #

28:13.125 --> 28:15.094
# Chad gadya... #

28:19.665 --> 28:22.177
How long you been
standing there?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.212
Long enough to see
that you are well hydrated

28:24.236 --> 28:25.947
after your time in the desert.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.451
And the thinking
behind surprising me?

28:28.340 --> 28:29.551
I was not sure what to say.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.219
But you were sure it had to be

28:31.243 --> 28:32.301
said in the men's room.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.608
I'm sure it had to be said.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.365
When you shot Michael,

28:44.389 --> 28:46.134
I almost killed you
where you stood.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.669
I wasn't standing.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.071
No, you weren't.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.372
You were lying on the ground

28:51.396 --> 28:54.275
without adequate backup,
completely violating protocol.

28:54.299 --> 28:55.977
And double-parked.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.469
Yes, I noticed.

29:02.207 --> 29:05.253
But that does not matter.

29:05.277 --> 29:09.145
Just like it does not matter
how it worked out for Michael.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.844
So what does?

29:18.323 --> 29:20.723
That you had my back.

29:23.328 --> 29:27.308
That you have always had my back

29:27.332 --> 29:30.111
and that I was...

29:30.135 --> 29:34.883
wrong... to question
your motives.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.898
So why did you?

29:37.943 --> 29:40.855
I trusted my brother Ari.

29:40.879 --> 29:43.291
I trusted Michael.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.079
I could not afford to trust you.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.369
I thought you weren't sure
what to say.

29:54.393 --> 29:58.955
Guess I had a long time
to think about things.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.379
I'm sorry, Ziva.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.462
No.

30:08.540 --> 30:11.771
It is I who am sorry.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.463
Your instincts were right.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.300
You were a cop,

30:25.324 --> 30:27.605
and I should have never faulted
you for thinking like one.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.725
I'm a cop.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.175
I think like a cop.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.360
Genius.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.798
I know how to find
Officer Shelley.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.284
Track his burn phone.

30:43.308 --> 30:44.485
Well, we already know
where it is.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.853
It's in the evidence garage.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.255
He's got another one.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.489
Well, that's great,

30:48.513 --> 30:49.791
but without
the cells' ESN numbers,

30:49.815 --> 30:51.025
we can't track any of 'em.

30:51.049 --> 30:52.026
Think, McSidekick.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.494
Use the leading man.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.696
Harness those powers.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.498
Okay.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.513
It was an unregistered phone.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.337
It was pricey

31:02.361 --> 31:03.671
- for a cop.
- Bingo.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.506
Shelley took it from a bust.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.507
Happens all the time.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.409
An extra Rolex

31:08.433 --> 31:10.378
or laptop disappears
from the evidence locker,

31:10.402 --> 31:12.013
not that I've ever done
anything like that.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.216
Officer Shelley busted
a black-market cell phone ring

31:15.240 --> 31:16.798
last year, and...

31:19.344 --> 31:21.522
the impounded cells'
ESN numbers are all logged.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.157
If he's got one,
we can track it.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.375
See if any are active.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.544
We got one of 'em.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.326
Making a call right now.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.567
Boss, you may want
to answer that.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.314
Yeah. Gibbs.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.150
Let me talk to DiNozzo.

31:49.174 --> 31:50.351
I'm here.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.686
I know how it looks.

31:51.710 --> 31:52.687
I shouldn't have run,

31:52.711 --> 31:54.689
but I didn't kill those guys.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.824
You draw the line
at criminal stalking?

31:56.848 --> 31:58.259
I was following 'em, yeah.

31:58.283 --> 32:00.728
Some kind of deal was going
down; I wanted the details.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.996
You wanted payback.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.531
The plan was just
to take their pot of gold,

32:03.555 --> 32:04.565
hit 'em where it hurts.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.800
I didn't kill anybody.

32:05.824 --> 32:06.801
I was set up.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.236
Well, then,

32:08.260 --> 32:10.238
why don't you just come on in?
I'm a good listener.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.939
I assume you got my location

32:11.963 --> 32:13.089
by now.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.377
Yeah.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.746
Phone booth

32:18.770 --> 32:20.114
by the news stand on K Street.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.265
Come alone.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.927
Thing belongs in a museum.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.195
McGee.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.244
Yeah, ready.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.425
Oh, boy.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.137
All right, hop out of there.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.796
I got to use the phone.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.149
Here they come,

32:55.173 --> 32:56.173
DiNozzo.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.612
Oh, yeah, yeah, I see 'em.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.160
Come on, we got to go.

33:06.184 --> 33:07.995
Come on!

33:08.019 --> 33:09.688
Here we go, now!

33:13.792 --> 33:14.802
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.870
I got something wet in my hands,

33:15.894 --> 33:17.254
but I don't want
to think about it.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.163
Shooter was pretty close.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.198
- Point-blank range.
- Witness saw

33:44.222 --> 33:46.868
someone approach the car, heard
the shot, shooter took off.

33:46.892 --> 33:49.704
Which suggests that Officer
Shelley knew his attacker.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.038
Said he was set up.

33:51.062 --> 33:53.808
Well, his presence here
would tend to confirm that.

33:53.832 --> 33:54.842
But set up by who?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.844
Someone who knew his past.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.679
Making it appear

33:58.703 --> 34:02.016
that he stalked and murdered
his tormenters.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.551
Hey.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.820
We got a lead on the mystery
deal Shelley was tracking.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.155
It's from Sergeant Ross's
C.O. in Korea.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.257
It's a report of a shooting

34:09.281 --> 34:12.427
near the DMZ at an airstrip
used by smugglers.

34:12.451 --> 34:13.895
C.O. thinks that's where Ross

34:13.918 --> 34:15.396
went on his two-day leave.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.831
After the shooting, SATCOM
tracked the plane leaving,

34:17.856 --> 34:18.933
lost contact.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.333
Think Ross had a package
on that plane?

34:20.358 --> 34:21.803
He had something.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.137
We want to find out what,

34:23.161 --> 34:24.929
we need to find out
who killed Officer...

34:26.431 --> 34:28.342
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.244
Shelley. Officer Shelley.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.713
I think it's something
on the body.

34:32.737 --> 34:33.781
Yes, cologne.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.016
He must have come into contact

34:35.040 --> 34:38.018
recently with an overcologner.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.121
I was just about
to take a sample

34:40.145 --> 34:41.956
up to Abby for analysis.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.208
We...

34:45.449 --> 34:47.094
So I advertise
on cologne bottles.

34:47.118 --> 34:48.429
Is that a crime?

34:48.453 --> 34:49.931
- Should be.
- Can't believe this.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.032
Amateur hour here.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.065
I looked into Hector's records.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.067
Turns out

34:53.091 --> 34:54.558
he is a man of many...

34:56.328 --> 34:58.239
A man of many talents.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.874
Sorry, boss.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.142
Strippers are just his cover.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.477
He's actually a fence.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.744
Never been convicted

35:03.768 --> 35:06.514
but suspected of fencing
everything from bootleg DVDs

35:06.538 --> 35:08.216
to SCUD missile parts.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.071
What's he fencing now?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.871
How'd you get the shiner?

35:16.915 --> 35:18.906
I cut myself shaving.

35:20.986 --> 35:22.977
Your DNA underneath
his fingernails.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.934
He came by this morning,
then he left.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.958
End of story.

35:29.094 --> 35:30.605
One body not good enough

35:30.629 --> 35:31.806
for you, tough guy? 'Cause I got

35:31.830 --> 35:34.242
three more right here!

35:34.266 --> 35:35.676
I had nothing to do with this

35:35.700 --> 35:37.011
and I told the cop
the same thing.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.127
Why was he asking you?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.751
You've got the right
to remain silent.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.753
Anything you say will be used
against you

35:45.777 --> 35:48.905
- in a court...
- Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.294
Jurel came to me
with something big.

35:53.318 --> 35:57.832
The plane out of Korea...
it had a package on it.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.120
The package was the plane.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.472
Jurel's buddies fudged
some paperwork,

36:04.496 --> 36:06.107
got their hands
on a military cargo plane

36:06.131 --> 36:07.542
scheduled for decommissioning.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.143
Jurel wanted me to fence it.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.645
Worth a couple million.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.580
They went to the hotel
to celebrate.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.615
My girl shows up.
She's only supposed to do

36:14.639 --> 36:17.618
her dance as a token
of my appreciation

36:17.642 --> 36:19.153
and pick up a package.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.489
The lock codes for the plane.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.505
And then you know
what she found instead.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.361
Officer Shelley.

36:27.385 --> 36:30.197
Next thing I know,
cop shows up at my door.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.365
Roughs me up

36:31.389 --> 36:33.401
and accuses me of setting him up
for murder.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.403
And he just lets you go?

36:35.427 --> 36:38.239
Yeah, after I told him
exactly what I'm telling you.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.807
He got the wrong guy.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.709
And I got

36:41.733 --> 36:44.378
about 50 people at Club Pubis

36:44.402 --> 36:46.881
that can testify to that.

36:46.905 --> 36:50.251
Well, it's not quite 50,
but, uh, close enough.

36:50.275 --> 36:51.852
Club Pubis is a strip club.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.020
Hector MCs there
on Thursday nights.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.056
There's at least a dozen people

36:55.080 --> 36:57.325
that can put him there
at the time of the murders.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.393
Who killed the cop?

36:59.417 --> 37:01.395
And...

37:01.419 --> 37:04.832
why they used an antique
percussion cap pistol to do it.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.702
I ran ballistics on the bullet
that killed Officer Shelley.

37:07.726 --> 37:11.505
- It was a new bullet fired from an old gun.
- How old?

37:11.529 --> 37:16.091
It was from a 19th century
VR tower pistol.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.422
I know a shooting range nearby

37:28.446 --> 37:30.024
- where you can take that for a spin.
- What?

37:30.048 --> 37:31.192
Spin?

37:31.216 --> 37:32.560
This is a fine antique,

37:32.584 --> 37:34.295
not some cheap revolver.

37:34.319 --> 37:36.464
Keep all your fine antiques
in the trunk?

37:36.488 --> 37:38.065
No.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.234
I recently discovered it
missing from inventory.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.736
I suspected it was stolen.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.438
And... I've been looking for it.

37:44.462 --> 37:45.906
And there it is.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.642
Yeah, it works out nicely for us

37:47.666 --> 37:49.367
since that gun was used
in a murder.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.114
- This isn't my car.
- Yeah, we know that.

37:53.138 --> 37:54.115
It's Elaina's.

37:54.139 --> 37:55.549
Where is she?

37:55.573 --> 37:56.651
I-I just called her.

37:56.675 --> 37:59.654
I said to meet me out here
to explain this.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.089
She hasn't had time
to dump it yet.

38:02.113 --> 38:06.209
Look who's here, boss.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.030
See, you run away like that,

38:09.054 --> 38:10.464
it kind of makes you
look guilty,

38:10.488 --> 38:12.299
Miss Marcus.

38:12.323 --> 38:13.467
Guilty of what?

38:13.491 --> 38:15.603
- Murder.
- Always said she was trouble.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.596
She found out about a deal
your boss had going down.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.777
You partnered
with Officer Shelley.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.045
Then you double-crossed him

38:24.069 --> 38:26.847
and kept the payday
for yourself.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.640
Set Shelley up for murder.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.986
What's so funny?

38:32.010 --> 38:34.488
You haven't arrested me.

38:34.512 --> 38:36.157
Means you don't have any proof.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.191
McProof.

38:37.215 --> 38:38.926
Fake suicide note

38:38.950 --> 38:40.294
we found on Shelley's computer...

38:40.318 --> 38:42.663
we traced the worm that planted
that back to your laptop.

38:42.687 --> 38:45.156
Proves you killed Jurel,
his buddies, and Shelley.

38:46.491 --> 38:49.470
You know what that means.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.863
- You're under arrest.
- You're under arrest.

38:53.898 --> 38:56.143
You're a bad little putty tat.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.345
Where'd boss go?

38:58.369 --> 39:00.360
I don't know.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.306
We need to talk.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.317
Sit down.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.474
When I came to see you and said

39:26.498 --> 39:28.976
I wanted back...

39:29.000 --> 39:31.992
you said it was
the director's call.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.531
But I sensed your hesitation.

39:39.744 --> 39:41.507
I sense it now.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.992
Even though I...

39:45.016 --> 39:48.247
thought I made myself clear.

39:49.287 --> 39:50.865
I understand

39:50.889 --> 39:52.666
- what you did in Israel...
- Your brother

39:52.690 --> 39:54.749
Ari.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.788
You know what happened
that night.

40:05.537 --> 40:08.282
It was here.

40:08.306 --> 40:10.035
I want to hear it from you.

40:13.278 --> 40:16.611
You had orders to kill
your brother to earn my trust?

40:18.650 --> 40:21.414
Yes.

40:22.453 --> 40:24.231
That's a problem.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.066
You don't understand.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.568
You're damn right
I don't understand.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.637
- When I volunteered for that mission...
- You killed

40:29.661 --> 40:31.238
your own brother, Ziva!

40:31.262 --> 40:34.241
It was because I hoped
my father was wrong about Ari

40:34.265 --> 40:36.911
and I did not want someone else
blindly following orders.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.546
I volunteered to protect him,
Gibbs.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.548
- You lied to me.
- No, when I told you

40:40.572 --> 40:42.631
Ari was innocent, I believed it.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.574
But yes.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.490
I would have lied to you.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.506
He was my brother.

40:54.752 --> 40:56.743
And you were nothing.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.970
But I was wrong about Ari.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.005
And you.

41:05.029 --> 41:08.809
When I pulled the trigger
to save your life,

41:08.833 --> 41:11.512
I was not following orders.

41:11.536 --> 41:13.561
I mean, how could you
even think?

41:15.607 --> 41:18.804
He was my brother.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.858
And now he is gone.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.161
Eli is all but dead to me.

41:27.185 --> 41:30.177
And the closest thing I have...

41:31.189 --> 41:34.181
to a father...

41:35.193 --> 41:37.184
is accusing me.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.223
Okay.

41:48.239 --> 41:50.217
Headed straight to the airport.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.486
Yeah, well, that's why
they call it a go bag, honey,

41:52.510 --> 41:54.488
and I keep it in the trunk
of my car.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.490
Yeah, all right.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.359
I'll-I'll call you
as soon as I land.

41:58.383 --> 41:59.393
Yeah, uh...

41:59.417 --> 42:00.850
I love you.

42:02.086 --> 42:03.898
I love you, too.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.733
Bye.

42:05.757 --> 42:07.759
All right.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.070
Moving on.

42:10.094 --> 42:11.238
So how was your date

42:11.262 --> 42:12.907
with the, uh, shrink
last night, McRomeo?

42:12.931 --> 42:14.475
Think I'm gonna tell you?

42:14.499 --> 42:15.976
Tells me everything
I need to know.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.211
It's actually
pretty complicated.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.113
Dr. Bracco is Ziva's...

42:19.137 --> 42:21.128
Ziva's what?

42:23.174 --> 42:25.165
Ziva's here.
