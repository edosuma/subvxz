00:20.594 --> 00:22.460
And now I present my history project

00:22.485 --> 00:24.045
about ancient Greece.

00:24.252 --> 00:26.202
I, uh, had some big plans.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.227
There was gonna be a musical component,

00:28.313 --> 00:30.256
there was a graphic novel in the works,

00:30.281 --> 00:31.731
and, well, what can I say?

00:31.816 --> 00:34.100
Some projects just, uh,
don't get off the ground.

00:34.185 --> 00:35.768
So, without further ado,

00:35.854 --> 00:39.522
I present the Acropolis,
made out of Popsicle sticks.

00:39.574 --> 00:40.990
The A-popsicol-is!

00:41.026 --> 00:44.797
Oh... wow!

00:46.698 --> 00:48.414
Who's Miss Twitchell to accuse me

00:48.500 --> 00:50.116
of giving up when things get hard?

00:50.201 --> 00:52.811
She's the divorcée, not me... not yet.

00:52.836 --> 00:55.538
Well, you do give up,
like, all the time.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.373
I mean, you're a
starter, not a finisher.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.841
Which the world needs.

00:58.877 --> 01:00.960
Without starters, how would we, um...

01:01.046 --> 01:02.845
- Finish anything?
- Exactly.

01:02.881 --> 01:05.381
You know what I need? A
little chocolate pick-me-up.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.111
Fortunately, I think
I might have some candy

01:07.135 --> 01:08.384
in my backpack.

01:08.470 --> 01:10.019
What? That's impossible.

01:10.055 --> 01:11.721
No, he probably does.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.000
Uh-oh, last one.

01:14.025 --> 01:15.586
All right, little Chunky Blast Off,

01:15.610 --> 01:17.110
a lot of pressure on you.

01:17.195 --> 01:19.278
Come on, now, do what you do to me.

01:19.364 --> 01:21.695
Don't be nervous. You're gonna be great.

01:23.068 --> 01:24.534
Ready to blast off?

01:24.569 --> 01:25.844
Uh, yeah.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.538
Ooh...

01:28.573 --> 01:31.624
Aah...

01:31.710 --> 01:33.076
Sisters, won't you join me

01:33.161 --> 01:34.922
as I stop at the store to purchase

01:34.947 --> 01:36.879
another box of this timeless classic?

01:36.904 --> 01:39.187
You get so charming
when you eat chocolate.

01:40.023 --> 01:41.250
What the... ?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.336
New look, "new great taste"?

01:43.421 --> 01:45.756
They put sunglasses
on the astronaut guy!

01:45.781 --> 01:47.673
And gave him frosted tips!

01:47.759 --> 01:51.422
- What about the "new great taste" part?
- I'm so scared. Here goes.

01:51.896 --> 01:54.597
No, no, no, eh, eh, bleh...

01:54.682 --> 01:56.933
Why?! Why, why, why, why, why?!

01:57.018 --> 01:58.684
- So... not great?
- Bleh! Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!

01:58.770 --> 02:00.186
Or what's the verdict?

02:00.271 --> 02:02.772
Hey, hey, hey, hey, kid,
you got to pay for that.

02:02.824 --> 02:04.323
Why would they do this to me?

02:04.348 --> 02:05.886
Why would they change Chunky Blast Offs?

02:05.910 --> 02:07.276
And where's Ronnie?

02:07.362 --> 02:09.862
I want my usual convenience
store checkout guy!

02:09.948 --> 02:11.164
Ronnie joined the Peace Corps.

02:11.249 --> 02:12.782
No!

02:12.867 --> 02:14.450
Hey, guys.

02:14.536 --> 02:15.835
How you doing?

02:15.920 --> 02:17.648
You mind if I use your
dishwasher? Mine's busted.

02:17.672 --> 02:20.089
Uh, yes. 'Cause we're a restaurant.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.257
Great.

02:21.292 --> 02:22.959
Teddy, those are golf balls.

02:23.011 --> 02:24.427
Good eye, Bob. Good eye.

02:24.462 --> 02:26.095
Why are you washing golf balls?

02:26.131 --> 02:27.131
'Cause they're dirty.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.275
I got 'em at the bottom of the lake

02:28.299 --> 02:29.882
at the municipal golf course.

02:29.968 --> 02:31.746
I clean 'em and then I sell
'em back to the golfers.

02:31.770 --> 02:33.052
I make a quarter each.

02:33.138 --> 02:35.054
That's about, uh, 75 bucks in there.

02:35.140 --> 02:36.806
Wow, that's sort of impressive.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.057
But keep that to yourself.

02:38.143 --> 02:39.358
I'm not exactly on good terms

02:39.444 --> 02:40.955
with management at the course right now.

02:40.979 --> 02:42.395
Okay. Wait, why?

02:42.480 --> 02:43.813
Guys at the pro shop wanted a cut.

02:43.865 --> 02:45.648
But I'm the one risking my life, right?

02:45.700 --> 02:47.200
Diving into a murky lake at night

02:47.285 --> 02:49.035
with nothing but a garden hose for air.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.319
I've said too much.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.715
I can trust you, right, Bob? Right?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.406
I don't got to worry about you, right?

02:53.491 --> 02:54.969
- Just, take it...
- You're not gonna tell anyone, right?

02:54.993 --> 02:56.520
- Take it easy.
- Just keep it to yourself, okay?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.439
- I-I won't tell anybody.
- Just... I know how you get.

02:58.463 --> 02:59.974
- I... Run out of things to talk about,
- They're just golf balls.

02:59.998 --> 03:01.275
and then next thing you're telling

03:01.299 --> 03:02.610
everybody that comes in here about...

03:02.634 --> 03:04.250
Teddy, there's no reason to insult me

03:04.335 --> 03:05.885
when you're using my dishwasher.

03:05.970 --> 03:07.136
Here, you know what?

03:07.172 --> 03:08.449
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?

03:08.473 --> 03:09.513
Uh, here's a little taste.

03:09.591 --> 03:11.057
Buy something nice for yourself.

03:11.827 --> 03:14.477
They changed Chunky Blast Offs!
They changed Chunky Blast Offs!

03:14.512 --> 03:16.479
What?! What happened? What happened?

03:16.514 --> 03:18.181
They changed Chunky Blast Offs.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.765
What are Chunky Blast Offs?

03:19.851 --> 03:23.186
The best thing this country's
produced since ankle socks.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.022
They messed with Gene's candy,
and now he's a big old mess.

03:26.074 --> 03:28.691
Aw, I hate it when they change candies.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.026
I hate it!

03:30.078 --> 03:31.527
So now I'm gonna get the geniuses

03:31.613 --> 03:33.863
at Spratt's Sweets to change it back.

03:33.915 --> 03:37.166
Spratt's Sweets dot com, and click.

03:37.202 --> 03:39.118
Live chat? Sure.

03:39.204 --> 03:40.786
"What can we help you with today?"

03:40.872 --> 03:43.923
Hmm. Change Chunky Blast
Offs back, you idiots.

03:44.008 --> 03:45.909
Sorry for the "you idiots" part.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.260
Margaret is typing.

03:47.345 --> 03:50.546
"Currently there are no
plans to change the formula

03:50.632 --> 03:52.048
"of Chunky Blast Offs,

03:52.100 --> 03:53.715
"but your comments have been noted.

03:53.740 --> 03:55.051
Have a delicious day"?!

03:55.136 --> 03:57.053
Well, I'm shocked that didn't work.

03:57.138 --> 03:59.772
Aw, I gave it a shot. Time to give up.

03:59.858 --> 04:00.890
That's the spirit.

04:00.942 --> 04:02.391
No.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.193
Time to Un-give up.

04:04.229 --> 04:05.278
The factory tour!

04:05.363 --> 04:06.629
Factory tour?

04:06.654 --> 04:08.030
They have free factory tours

04:08.066 --> 04:09.543
every day except
Christmas, which is fine,

04:09.567 --> 04:11.234
because I'm busy on Christmas.

04:11.286 --> 04:13.369
We'll go to the Spratt's factory tour,

04:13.404 --> 04:15.288
and I'll get my day in candy court!

04:15.373 --> 04:16.906
You're talking crazy, Gene.

04:16.958 --> 04:17.990
No, I'm not!

04:18.076 --> 04:19.575
I'll take you on the tour.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.910
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.879
I'm proud of Gene for taking a stand.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.747
You little Erin Choco-vich, you.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.069
But they're probably not
gonna listen to a kid, Lin.

04:27.094 --> 04:28.167
Of course, I know.

04:28.253 --> 04:29.669
But we should support Gene's cause.

04:29.754 --> 04:32.505
- Oh, it's a cause now?
- It's a cause. Support it.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.423
I think you just want to go on the tour.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.425
What? I don't even like candy.

04:36.511 --> 04:39.145
Ach! Ptuh! Cavities. Cavity creeps. Ech.

04:40.765 --> 04:42.765
As you can see, we still make our candy

04:42.850 --> 04:45.601
the same way that our
founder, Ferdinand Spratt, did

04:45.687 --> 04:48.020
over 80 years ago, but with robots.

04:48.098 --> 04:49.510
Excuse me, Michelle.

04:49.535 --> 04:51.213
Is there gonna be, like, a Q & A

04:51.238 --> 04:54.144
with the boss man or boss woman of
this place at the end of the tour?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.675
Yeah, my brother's got
some Qs that need As.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.545
Spratt's Sweets is governed
by its board of directors.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.551
And unless you're a
stockholder, little fella,

05:01.576 --> 05:03.832
they're just a bit too
busy to answer questions.

05:03.857 --> 05:05.946
But we came all this
way so my brother could

05:05.970 --> 05:07.090
talk to someone in charge.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.223
Hey, anyone ever wonder how we keep

05:09.317 --> 05:10.950
all the wrappers organized?

05:10.985 --> 05:13.202
- Kinda.
- Sorry, Gene.

05:13.287 --> 05:15.087
We'll get you something
nice at the gift shop.

05:15.156 --> 05:16.488
Unless you're too sad to enjoy it,

05:16.574 --> 05:17.968
and then we'll just get me something.

05:19.410 --> 05:20.876
At the end of this hall,

05:20.962 --> 05:23.329
we'll all take turns
looking through a window

05:23.414 --> 05:25.148
into the accounting office.

05:26.445 --> 05:27.967
The Ferdinand Spratt?

05:29.670 --> 05:32.004
Are you Ferdinand Spratt,
as in Spratt's Sweets?

05:32.089 --> 05:34.279
Yeah, you're talking to
the last living Spratt.

05:34.304 --> 05:37.021
- Who are you?
- My name's Gene, and I'm a huge fan

05:37.046 --> 05:38.310
of Spratt's Sweets.

05:38.346 --> 05:40.262
Did you peel off from the factory tour?

05:40.348 --> 05:43.265
- How'd you know? Hair net?
- Yep. It's an awful tour.

05:43.351 --> 05:45.017
- So awful!
- Who's your tour guide?

05:45.102 --> 05:46.235
- Michelle?
- Yup.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.820
Figures. She's the only one.

05:47.855 --> 05:50.406
Look, I came all this way
to talk to someone in charge.

05:50.491 --> 05:52.941
But now I've met you,
the most in-charge person

05:52.966 --> 05:54.276
in the whole place.

05:54.362 --> 05:56.111
Technically speaking, yeah.

05:56.197 --> 05:57.367
So what can I do for you?

05:57.392 --> 06:00.032
Your company changed Chunky Blast Offs,

06:00.084 --> 06:02.418
and I really, really, really want you

06:02.503 --> 06:03.702
to change them back.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.287
Let's say by Monday at the latest.

06:05.373 --> 06:06.538
- That's it?
- That's it.

06:06.590 --> 06:07.923
- Done.
- Wait, really?

06:08.009 --> 06:10.042
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow, great. So it's done?

06:10.127 --> 06:11.510
Well, not done. It's gonna be,

06:11.545 --> 06:13.045
like, a whole thing with the suits,

06:13.130 --> 06:15.381
but from one mega
Spratt's fan to another,

06:15.433 --> 06:16.632
I promise to help.

06:16.717 --> 06:18.300
Yes! Thank you, Ferdie!

06:18.386 --> 06:19.885
But first, I need your help.

06:19.970 --> 06:21.970
I want to tie licorice
whips to the ceiling fan

06:22.056 --> 06:23.389
to make a licorice tornado,

06:23.474 --> 06:25.234
but I'm scared to go
to the top of the ladder

06:25.276 --> 06:26.392
without someone holding it.

06:26.444 --> 06:28.644
Uh, licorice tornado? Yeah.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.267
So while we're stuck
on the tour learning

06:35.292 --> 06:37.181
about how humidity affects nougat,

06:37.206 --> 06:38.805
Gene sneaks off and becomes BFFs

06:38.874 --> 06:40.407
with the founder's grandson.

06:40.476 --> 06:42.593
And if you thought nougat
likes lots of humidity,

06:42.661 --> 06:44.361
you'd be wrong... dead wrong.

06:44.430 --> 06:45.807
And we're all sure this guy's actually

06:45.831 --> 06:47.097
who he says he is?

06:47.166 --> 06:48.765
I'm just saying, he is a stranger

06:48.834 --> 06:50.334
giving Gene candy.

06:50.402 --> 06:52.169
The best kind of stranger.

06:52.238 --> 06:55.231
And he's gonna put the old
Chunky Blast Offs back in orbit.

06:55.256 --> 06:58.030
- Because it's... space?
- I get it.

06:58.055 --> 07:00.744
Well, Ferdie said it's
not entirely up to him.

07:00.813 --> 07:03.513
He has to convince someone
called the "board of directors."

07:03.582 --> 07:05.616
So how is he going to do that?

07:05.684 --> 07:08.285
That's what Ferdie and I are
gonna figure out tomorrow.

07:08.354 --> 07:10.006
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, I'm going back

07:10.031 --> 07:12.222
there after school to work on our plan.

07:12.274 --> 07:14.775
Really? Lin, you're gonna
take him there again?

07:14.860 --> 07:17.194
Yeah. He's fighting for
something he believes in.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.313
And he could put it down
on his résumé someday.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.310
"Fought the Man, saved
candy, cute as a button."

07:22.335 --> 07:24.401
Th-That's not a great résumé.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.904
Is there any other reason
you want to take him?

07:26.956 --> 07:28.405
You didn't want to maybe

07:28.457 --> 07:30.657
buy more candy in the gift shop, Lin?

07:30.743 --> 07:32.743
What? There's a gift shop?

07:32.828 --> 07:34.244
Okay, let's see,

07:34.296 --> 07:36.052
how are we gonna get
those suits upstairs

07:36.077 --> 07:37.047
to listen to us?

07:37.082 --> 07:38.916
Good question. Oh, hey,

07:39.001 --> 07:40.751
I haven't given you the cool tour.

07:40.803 --> 07:42.849
Want to do that before we get crackin'?

07:42.874 --> 07:44.054
Uh...

07:44.089 --> 07:46.056
So I get to drive these whenever I want.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.091
They go up and down, back and forth.

07:48.143 --> 07:49.927
- Whatever you're into.
- Yeah, cool.

07:49.979 --> 07:52.012
So should we start coming up with ideas?

07:52.097 --> 07:54.648
I feel like our meeting
got a little sidetracked.

07:54.733 --> 07:56.817
Okay, yeah, let's brainstorm real quick.

07:56.902 --> 07:59.403
Uh, hmm. Oh, hey!

07:59.438 --> 08:00.904
So they just let me come in here

08:00.940 --> 08:02.489
and throw these up against the glass.

08:02.574 --> 08:04.860
They love it. Wanted to
make sure I showed you this.

08:05.744 --> 08:07.244
What a tour. Thank you.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.029
But now let's figure out

08:09.114 --> 08:11.615
how you're gonna talk to
your office business people.

08:11.667 --> 08:14.835
Well, nowadays, business
isn't done in offices.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.954
Business is done walking really fast

08:17.006 --> 08:18.895
down long hallways and at urinals.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.290
Haven't you seen Entourage?

08:20.342 --> 08:23.427
Is it a show about people
peeing and getting stuff done?

08:23.462 --> 08:26.129
- Yeah, more or less.
- Then do that. Do the urinal plan.

08:26.181 --> 08:28.215
Uh, but what about
the lady board members?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.550
We'll have to convince
them to use the urinals.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.302
Leave that to me.

08:32.388 --> 08:34.855
All right, how's this
for a urinal opener?

08:34.940 --> 08:37.357
"Look what's coming out of
the business end of that thing!

08:37.443 --> 08:38.725
Speaking of business... "

08:38.811 --> 08:40.051
And then you speak of business.

08:40.111 --> 08:41.561
I like it. It's good.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.980
Hey, call it a day?

08:43.065 --> 08:44.815
Okay, but we haven't
really figured out much

08:44.900 --> 08:46.700
besides my great opening line.

08:46.785 --> 08:49.036
Yeah, I know, but I usually try

08:49.121 --> 08:51.071
to knock out a nap around this time,

08:51.156 --> 08:53.434
and so I just feel like, you know,

08:53.459 --> 08:54.791
it's the right time to do it.

08:55.084 --> 08:57.828
And, wow, you are going to sleep.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.473
I will show myself out

08:59.498 --> 09:01.665
after taking one Uncle
Nuts bar off your desk.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.884
So, you come up with your plan?

09:03.969 --> 09:05.335
Sort of. It seems like Ferdie

09:05.387 --> 09:07.322
doesn't really want to put in the work.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.506
Like, at all. Wow, it's weird to hear

09:09.558 --> 09:10.902
those words coming out of my mouth.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.393
He says we'll nail it down tomorrow.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.145
Sure, sure, you'll get it tomorrow.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.680
Hey, this'll be our after-school

09:16.732 --> 09:18.515
snack-tivity this week.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.485
So you sold all your balls?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.854
- Sold all the balls.
- You don't sound happy.

09:23.906 --> 09:25.706
I just keep thinking
about the sunken treasure

09:25.741 --> 09:27.741
that I left behind in the deeps.

09:27.826 --> 09:29.359
- In the what?
- The deeps.

09:29.445 --> 09:31.006
It's what I call the
deep part of the lake.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.579
- Nine feet deep.
- Mm-hmm.

09:32.664 --> 09:35.233
No light. No life. No sound.

09:35.258 --> 09:37.054
Man's alone with his
thoughts down there, Bobby.

09:37.079 --> 09:38.285
Except for some tadpoles.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.731
There's plenty of tadpoles down there.

09:39.755 --> 09:41.038
What's the sunken treasure?

09:41.090 --> 09:43.874
Thousands of balls, but,
uh, I can't get to 'em.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.043
I'd be diving deeper
than I'd ever gone before.

09:46.095 --> 09:48.345
I need someone to feed me
the hose, keep a lookout.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.880
But, uh, who could I get, you know?

09:49.965 --> 09:51.181
What do I do? What do I do?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.549
♪ Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup. ♪

09:52.634 --> 09:54.434
Probably never go back, call it quits.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.969
- Right. Team up!
- No.

09:56.055 --> 09:57.721
- It'd be you and me!
- No, not team up.

09:57.773 --> 09:59.556
Yeah, come on, Bob, one last score,

09:59.608 --> 10:01.608
and then we're done, we're
out, we're set for life.

10:01.693 --> 10:03.121
- Teddy, I-I...
- Right? No looking back.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.622
- I don't think so.
- What do you want to do, Bob?

10:04.646 --> 10:06.730
Work in this dead-end
job the rest of your life,

10:06.782 --> 10:08.231
- flipping burgers?
- Teddy...

10:08.317 --> 10:10.131
You didn't exactly light
the world on fire, Bob.

10:10.369 --> 10:12.047
- Wait, what? What? No.
- You know what I mean?

10:12.071 --> 10:13.765
It's great, you got a
restaurant here, but come on.

10:13.789 --> 10:15.826
- All right, I'll do it.
- What? Really?

10:15.851 --> 10:17.764
I don't have to go in, right? You go in.

10:17.789 --> 10:19.220
- What?
- I just have to hold the thing.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.794
Sure, if that's all you want to do.

10:20.879 --> 10:22.996
I mean, if you only want
to live life that much,

10:23.082 --> 10:25.215
you just could hold
the thing, I suppose.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.850
You really don't want
to go in the water?

10:26.919 --> 10:28.251
No, I will not go in the water.

10:28.303 --> 10:29.447
I thought that's why
you were gonna do it.

10:29.471 --> 10:30.921
You want to go in the water with me.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.067
- No, I don't want to dive...
- I thought we would be

10:32.091 --> 10:33.473
fighting over the hose. No?

10:33.498 --> 10:34.975
I don't want to dive into a scummy pond.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.984
Really? You got no Jacques
Cousteau in you, huh, Bobby?

10:40.694 --> 10:43.433
I've eaten you, I've eaten
you, I've eaten you...

10:43.485 --> 10:46.103
Oh, you're new. What's your situation?

10:46.188 --> 10:47.771
Beatrice, loving the new 'do.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.906
N-Nothing's changed. It's the same 'do.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.702
Mm. It's different.
Maybe you didn't wash it.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.660
Ferdie? Gene's here.

10:53.745 --> 10:54.861
- Again.
- Hey, Gene.

10:54.947 --> 10:57.781
Hey, Ferdie. Ready to brainstorm?
Perfect our pee pee pitch?

10:57.833 --> 10:59.783
Yeah, listen, I've been thinking.

10:59.835 --> 11:02.536
I'm not so sure the
urinal plan is gonna work.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.274
Why not?

11:03.299 --> 11:05.646
Because I almost tried it,
and it was, like, awkward.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.902
I couldn't even tell you if
that guy was a board member.

11:07.926 --> 11:09.459
I mean, he had a suit on,

11:09.545 --> 11:11.962
he had a penis, he looked familiar.

11:12.014 --> 11:13.964
Okay, we'll come up with another plan.

11:14.016 --> 11:18.203
I don't know. We've already
put, like, a ton of work into it.

11:18.228 --> 11:20.854
Let's face it, it's gonna be way
too hard to convince the board

11:20.939 --> 11:22.772
to change Chunky Blast Offs back.

11:22.808 --> 11:25.358
- Wait, you're giving up?
- Not exactly.

11:25.444 --> 11:26.893
Wait, yes. Exactly.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.375
First your company
betrays me and now you!

11:29.400 --> 11:30.897
What is it with this place?!

11:30.983 --> 11:32.816
Maybe the next candy
you make should be called

11:32.901 --> 11:35.819
"Betrayal Brittle," or something
that has the word betrayal in it

11:35.904 --> 11:38.488
'cause you're all experts at
betrayal! Betrayal mix!

11:38.540 --> 11:40.207
- You're the betrayer!
- What?!

11:40.292 --> 11:43.326
- Beatrice, who's betraying who?
- Sorry, what's going on?

11:43.412 --> 11:45.412
That's right. She's on my side.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.913
I think Gene needs to go.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.299
And he's not allowed
in my office anymore.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.834
So you want me to call security?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.503
That won't be necessary. I'm leaving.

11:53.589 --> 11:56.187
Beatrice, please page
my mom in the gift shop,

11:56.212 --> 11:59.142
tell her I'll be by the car
and that I'm not crying at all!

12:05.501 --> 12:08.352
I'm sorry Ferdinand turned
out to be such a turd-inand.

12:08.421 --> 12:11.255
But, Gene, we're proud of you.
You gave it your best shot.

12:11.324 --> 12:14.024
Yeah, Gene, you got closer than
any of us thought you would.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.595
Okay, we'll leave you alone

12:17.663 --> 12:20.080
and let you have farty
time on the couchies.

12:20.116 --> 12:23.667
If Ferdie had just stuck to the
urinal plan, it would've worked.

12:23.753 --> 12:25.812
Well, maybe someone else
needs to step up now.

12:25.837 --> 12:28.280
You started this crazy candy ride,

12:28.305 --> 12:30.791
now finish it, you son of a bitch!

12:30.877 --> 12:33.567
Wow! I love motivational speeches.

12:33.592 --> 12:36.013
Now I know what it must
be like to play basketball.

12:36.098 --> 12:37.895
Here's what you're
gonna do: you're gonna go

12:37.920 --> 12:40.017
into the board room and
convince them yourself.

12:40.102 --> 12:41.435
But I can't get in there!

12:41.470 --> 12:43.687
I'm not allowed on the executive floors.

12:43.773 --> 12:46.974
But you can still take the factory tour.

12:47.026 --> 12:49.143
Why would I want to do
that? It was terrible.

12:49.228 --> 12:50.444
The mail room was nice.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.062
No, the tour is just our cover.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.480
We'll peel off from the group

12:53.566 --> 12:55.566
and sneak Gene into the board meeting.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.575
Really? You'd do that for me?

12:57.600 --> 12:59.213
If it means watching you barge into

12:59.238 --> 13:02.440
a board of directors meeting
half-cocked, then yes I will.

13:04.293 --> 13:05.626
- I think we're good, Bobby.
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.661 --> 13:07.161
- I think we're finally good to go.
- Mm.

13:07.213 --> 13:09.663
We'll enter by the 16th
and then we'll cut across.

13:09.749 --> 13:11.832
- Did you bring your ski mask?
- No. Did you?

13:11.918 --> 13:13.362
Uh... You brought gloves though, right?

13:13.386 --> 13:14.335
- No.
- No?

13:14.387 --> 13:15.970
- No!
- Did I not say this?

13:16.005 --> 13:17.282
- I... No, you didn't...
- I told you to bring a ski mask!

13:17.306 --> 13:19.390
- I told you to bring gloves, no?
- No. You d-definitely didn't.

13:19.475 --> 13:22.037
- I definitely didn't say that?
- Oh, my God.

13:22.062 --> 13:25.346
Okay. You're frustrated, you're scared.
That's okay. But listen.

13:25.398 --> 13:27.314
Don't let the dogs
smell that fear on you.

13:27.350 --> 13:29.266
- You know?
- Dogs? What dogs?

13:29.352 --> 13:31.402
Wait, you have padding on your arms?

13:31.487 --> 13:33.354
- Yeah, but, uh...
- Is that for the dogs?

13:33.439 --> 13:35.689
No, it's just from, uh, another thing.

13:35.741 --> 13:38.609
From Rollerblading. But,
yeah, no, now that you say it,

13:38.694 --> 13:40.806
it's probably gonna help with
the dogs. You're probably right.

13:40.830 --> 13:42.863
Wait, have you been
bitten by these dogs?

13:42.915 --> 13:46.200
No. I mean, yes, once, but
that's why I got the padding.

13:46.252 --> 13:47.612
- Yeah, but I don't have the padding.
- No.

13:47.670 --> 13:48.990
You didn't say bring padding.

13:49.038 --> 13:51.183
No, but I also didn't tell
you that I got bit by a dog.

13:51.207 --> 13:53.318
Oh, my God. Why did I do this?

13:54.710 --> 13:57.094
- All right, light me up.
- Here you go.

13:59.932 --> 14:02.049
You okay?

14:02.101 --> 14:03.384
Oh!

14:03.436 --> 14:04.969
- I'm gonna be fine.
- You were just...

14:05.054 --> 14:06.414
This always happens the first time.

14:06.472 --> 14:08.200
I know, but you were,
like, down there for, like,

14:08.224 --> 14:09.607
just, like, two seconds.

14:09.692 --> 14:11.525
- You barely went down.
- I just got scared.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.560
Okay.

14:12.645 --> 14:14.395
Are you okay? You're choking?

14:14.480 --> 14:17.231
- Breathe in through the hose.
- I am. I'm using the hose.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.156
- I'm trying to...
- Teddy, you're vomiting.

14:19.201 --> 14:21.118
It's making me g...

14:21.203 --> 14:23.181
You said you've done this
before. It's making me gag.

14:23.205 --> 14:25.489
- Maybe I try it once without the hose.
- No, you can't go...

14:25.574 --> 14:27.541
That's why I'm here. Just go down.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.076
I'm ch... Oh, my God.

14:29.128 --> 14:30.472
I'm gagging every time I try it, Bobby.

14:30.496 --> 14:31.662
Dive down, Teddy.

14:33.549 --> 14:35.833
- All right.
- Did you get any?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.218
Yeah, I got, like, three
and a couple in my pocket.

14:38.254 --> 14:39.753
Well, go back down.

14:39.805 --> 14:41.255
Don't tell me what to do, Bobby!

14:41.340 --> 14:43.173
I'm not leaving here with three balls!

14:43.259 --> 14:44.758
I can't get that extra foot.

14:44.810 --> 14:46.510
That's why they call it the deeps.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.762
Teddy, go back down and get more.

14:48.848 --> 14:51.765
All right I'm going, I'm going.
Just, uh, give me a second.

14:51.817 --> 14:54.001
Teddy, you said there were
a thousand balls down there.

14:54.070 --> 14:56.181
All right, I'm going down
one more t... one more time.

14:56.205 --> 14:57.321
Great. Go.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.325
Ugh.

15:01.410 --> 15:04.078
- So, how you gonna spend your share?
- Teddy, shh.

15:04.113 --> 15:05.279
- SkyMall?
- Shh.

15:05.364 --> 15:07.448
Why? We can be loud at this point.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.832
Hey! Who's over there?!

15:08.918 --> 15:10.095
Go, go, go, go, go,
go! Go, go, go, go, go!

15:11.837 --> 15:13.432
Oh, my God. You hear that?

15:13.456 --> 15:14.838
Dogs! Oh, my God!

15:14.924 --> 15:17.177
Aah! Golf cart.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.428
- Uh...
- St-Stairs!

15:21.464 --> 15:23.097
- Stairs!
- I got to take 'em!

15:23.132 --> 15:25.182
- No, no, no, no!
- I got to take 'em, Bobby!

15:25.267 --> 15:26.800
If we don't make it, I love you.

15:26.852 --> 15:27.968
I friggin' love you.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.603
- I love you, too.
- Yeah!

15:29.638 --> 15:30.721
Let's do it!

15:32.141 --> 15:34.692
Aah! We're losing all the golf balls!

15:34.777 --> 15:36.810
- Bobby, hold on to them!
- Oh, oh, oh!

15:36.862 --> 15:39.947
That was great!

15:39.982 --> 15:41.453
We did it!

15:42.651 --> 15:45.152
Good luck breaking into
the candy board room.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.132
I'm gonna break into a
giant bag of deformed candy

15:47.156 --> 15:48.238
that only costs a buck.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.076
Hey, you three look familiar.

15:52.161 --> 15:53.805
Didn't you just take
the tour last weekend?

15:53.829 --> 15:55.379
We're kids; we like candy.

15:55.464 --> 15:57.965
- Now tour us.
- Whoa!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.833
Now let's go have a look at

15:59.885 --> 16:03.087
the candy-making equipment
getting cleaned and dried.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.421
Okay, so where's this display

16:04.507 --> 16:06.256
we're gonna Trojan horse you in with?

16:06.342 --> 16:08.892
There's a room full of those
dumb new Chunky Blast Offs

16:08.978 --> 16:10.775
displays right through here.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.278
All right, just get me in the

16:14.303 --> 16:15.790
elevator and up into the board room.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.017
The meeting's about to start.

16:17.069 --> 16:19.069
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.

16:19.155 --> 16:21.155
- Busted.
- Oh, no.

16:21.190 --> 16:24.324
We got separated from the
super interesting factory tour.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.943
It happens. Come on, I'll get you back

16:26.028 --> 16:27.694
before you miss too much.

16:27.747 --> 16:29.279
Oh, no. You don't have to do that.

16:29.365 --> 16:31.365
Yeah, you probably have to patrol.

16:31.450 --> 16:33.367
No, no. It's no trouble at all.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.347
- Sounds like a lot of trouble.
- No, you know what? Yeah, it does.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.065
- It's really not.
- We don't want to bother you.

16:37.089 --> 16:39.173
Hey, did you see how
they print the boxes yet?

16:39.208 --> 16:40.340
We did not.

16:40.376 --> 16:42.042
- Uh, we did, and...
- We did.

16:42.094 --> 16:43.321
Believe me, if you saw
it, you'd remember it.

16:43.345 --> 16:44.511
That's for sure.

16:44.547 --> 16:46.296
You got your hairnets?
Where's your hairnet?

16:46.382 --> 16:48.348
Uh... I got a couple in my pocket here.

16:48.384 --> 16:50.050
Here you go. You can
keep those, you know.

16:50.136 --> 16:52.136
- What? No.
- Come on, let's go.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.415
Oh, no, it's... please.

16:53.439 --> 16:56.056
- Come on.
- All right, all right, all right!

16:56.142 --> 16:57.057
What's happening?

16:57.143 --> 16:58.370
You got to get to the board room.

16:58.394 --> 16:59.560
We'll meet you there.

16:59.612 --> 17:01.395
Oh, sure, that'll be easy.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.443
Well, here goes nothing...

17:13.516 --> 17:15.432
Bringing their promotion
items down here, huh?

17:15.467 --> 17:17.800
Well, they're always coming
up with new things, those guys.

17:19.388 --> 17:21.583
And the peanut blight in Puerto Rico

17:21.608 --> 17:23.775
really was a blight on
this fiscal quarter...

17:23.861 --> 17:25.204
... as you can see from that...

17:25.229 --> 17:27.279
What? I don't get it.

17:27.364 --> 17:29.397
Why is that rocket coming in here?

17:29.450 --> 17:30.699
Oh.

17:30.734 --> 17:32.200
What's going on?

17:32.236 --> 17:33.568
Is it someone's birthday?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.036
- Ugh!
- Gene?

17:35.072 --> 17:36.955
Give me a sec.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.657
What are you doing here?

17:38.742 --> 17:40.909
I came here to say the
stuff that needs saying

17:40.961 --> 17:43.378
that you didn't have the
guts to say so I'm gonna!

17:43.413 --> 17:46.465
I know he's just a little
boy, but I'm calling 9-1-1.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.250
- No.
- Hey.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.918
You are gonna listen to him.

17:49.970 --> 17:52.220
Gene's my friend, and I betrayed him.

17:52.256 --> 17:54.806
And he's gonna talk, and
we're all gonna listen.

17:54.892 --> 17:56.758
And if I tune out a
little, it's only because

17:56.810 --> 17:58.477
I know most of what he's about to say.

17:58.562 --> 18:01.062
All right, fine,
you-you've got two minutes.

18:01.098 --> 18:04.649
Thanks, Ferdie. Look, I really
care about Chunky Blast Offs.

18:04.735 --> 18:07.435
And you people changed them,
and now they taste gross

18:07.488 --> 18:09.604
and the astronaut guy looks creepy.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.940
I'm sure you have your dumb reasons,

18:12.025 --> 18:15.327
but the original Chunky Blast
Offs used to taste so good

18:15.412 --> 18:17.112
and meant so much to me.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.591
And now that they're gone, I feel like

18:18.615 --> 18:20.282
a part of me went with them.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.868
Are you trying to say a part
of your childhood went away?

18:22.953 --> 18:25.787
Huh? Oh, uh, I don't know...
Hey, man, I was on a roll.

18:25.873 --> 18:27.455
All right, sorry, sorry. Just continue.

18:27.541 --> 18:31.376
You people bring happiness 
to millions of kids.

18:31.461 --> 18:33.461
But then it's like you gave up on us.

18:33.514 --> 18:35.630
And I know a little
something about giving up.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.967
Until a few days ago, I was
known as a chronic giver-upper.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.468
Are you trying to say "quitter"?

18:40.554 --> 18:41.686
Please!

18:41.772 --> 18:43.638
Don't you people remember what it's like

18:43.690 --> 18:45.807
to care about your favorite candy?

18:45.859 --> 18:47.859
Or have you been dressing
up in business suits

18:47.945 --> 18:50.061
and drinking business water for so long

18:50.147 --> 18:51.479
that you don't even remember?

18:51.565 --> 18:53.315
This is just water, just normal...

18:53.367 --> 18:55.400
I don't know what "business water" is.

18:55.485 --> 18:57.652
- You, guy with the glasses.
- Huh? Hey.

18:57.704 --> 19:01.039
When was the last time you even
ate one of the candies you make?

19:01.124 --> 19:03.658
I-I don't know, a year? Maybe two?

19:03.710 --> 19:05.327
A year? That's crazy!

19:05.379 --> 19:07.162
What about you, lady
with the turtle pin?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.247
Oh. Uh, a couple months ago, maybe?

19:09.333 --> 19:11.166
- What's your favorite candy?
- I don't know.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.812
- I haven't given it any thought.
- Come on, come on!

19:12.836 --> 19:14.236
Just think back when you were a kid,

19:14.304 --> 19:16.087
before you were this soulless...

19:16.173 --> 19:17.005
Watch it.

19:17.057 --> 19:18.557
Come on, you know the answer.

19:18.642 --> 19:20.675
- A Goshdarnit Bar!
- Ah! Good!

19:20.761 --> 19:21.843
What about you?

19:21.929 --> 19:22.978
Sp-Sprickle-Sprackles.

19:23.013 --> 19:24.512
Go on, dig in!

19:24.598 --> 19:26.097
- Whoa.
- Wow. This is really different

19:26.183 --> 19:27.649
than the accounting office.

19:27.684 --> 19:29.100
- Come on, be a kid again!
- Ow.

19:29.186 --> 19:30.852
Sorry, I just hit someone in the head.

19:30.938 --> 19:33.238
It was me. It's fine. 
It's not a big deal.

19:33.323 --> 19:35.323
- Your eye is bleeding.
- So, who's with me?!

19:35.359 --> 19:37.409
Let's change Chunky Blast Offs back!

19:37.494 --> 19:39.361
- I second it.
- I third.

19:39.413 --> 19:40.912
- Hooray!
- You changed my opinion.

19:40.998 --> 19:43.365
All right. Well, it looks like we'll be

19:43.450 --> 19:46.167
changing back to the original
Chunky Blast Offs after all.

19:46.203 --> 19:47.535
It's unanimous.

19:47.588 --> 19:49.120
Yes.

19:49.206 --> 19:51.373
Yes! Ha-ha! I can't believe it!

19:51.425 --> 19:53.375
- Atta-way, Gene!
- Hoorah. Huzzah.

19:53.427 --> 19:55.710
- Did Gene really just do that?
- Looks like it.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.773
Al, get me a cost
breakdown and a timeline

19:57.798 --> 20:01.216
for putting the old formula
and the packaging back online.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.268
Uh, sure. I can estimate that.

20:03.353 --> 20:05.103
It's gonna be, uh, somewhere between

20:05.188 --> 20:07.472
15 and 20 million dollars.

20:07.557 --> 20:09.140
Oh, then forget it.

20:09.226 --> 20:10.892
- That's... no.
- All right.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.895
You did great in there,
Gene. You should feel proud.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.614
You saw it through. You kept with it.

20:15.699 --> 20:16.699
Yeah, but we failed.

20:16.733 --> 20:18.316
No, Gene, you failed.

20:18.402 --> 20:19.618
- Huh.
- No, no.

20:19.703 --> 20:20.819
You totally nailed it.

20:20.904 --> 20:22.621
You reminded those suit-bags

20:22.706 --> 20:25.801
what really matters to
a candy company: kids.

20:25.826 --> 20:27.409
- And money.
- And money.

20:27.461 --> 20:29.911
Hey, we've got, like,
20, 30,000 old formula

20:29.963 --> 20:31.379
Chunky Blast Offs in the warehouse.

20:31.415 --> 20:32.497
You want 'em?

20:32.582 --> 20:35.250
Ah, yeah.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.918
I feel good. Do you guys feel good?

20:36.970 --> 20:38.564
Oh, my heart's beating like crazy.

20:38.588 --> 20:39.983
I'm sure it's fine.
Let's go. I'll drive.

20:40.007 --> 20:42.757
Look at that thing. It's
gonna last you into your 20s.

20:42.843 --> 20:44.843
- I give it a month.
- I give it a week.

20:44.928 --> 20:46.928
And I will spend that week in this box.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.563
Please forward my mail to this address.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.434
- Gene, give me one. Give me one.
- No! No.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.985
- Give it! Give it to me!
- No.
