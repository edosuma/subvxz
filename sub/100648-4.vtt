00:04.134 --> 00:06.093
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

00:06.136 --> 00:07.181
- Guess we're
back in business.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.487
Lemonade?
We have an employee, okay?

00:09.531 --> 00:10.662
- Where did this guy
go to prison?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.490
- He's gonna wash in ways
that we can't.

00:12.534 --> 00:13.709
- So he just showed up
with all of it?

00:13.752 --> 00:15.276
- Minus his cut, yeah.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.581
- So your sister
was trying to protect you?

00:16.625 --> 00:18.018
- Who's gonna protect her?

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
- You know what
they call this in the biz?

00:19.367 --> 00:21.195
A breakthrough.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.110
- Your principal says that you
and some girls shoplifted this.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.676
- Like mother,
like daughter, I guess.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.504
- We're not bad people.

00:26.548 --> 00:29.812
- No, baby, we're good people
who do bad things.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.596
- I gotta show you something.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.163
- Lung...

00:33.207 --> 00:36.079
Spleen.
Shoulder.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.472
Yeah, we both know
how this ends.

00:37.515 --> 00:38.777
- I'm pregnant.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.345
- So you have
a nine-month solution

00:41.389 --> 00:43.130
to a permanent problem.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.262
- Three months.
Maybe four.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.611
- Congratulations.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.526
- Paternity test.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.485
- Oh, you can do that
in about a month.

00:50.528 --> 00:51.790
- Tried telling him to leave.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.358
Says his boss needs him
to keep an eye on you.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.707
Who's his boss?

00:55.751 --> 00:58.188
- There's something
I have to tell you.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.592
- Are we going to school today?

01:14.683 --> 01:17.207
- Uh--
- We're already late.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.889
- 'Cause it's not the gun
that does the damage.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.282
It's the caliber of the bullet.

03:15.325 --> 03:16.979
- Mm-hmm.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.329
- So just depends
on your needs.

you can or can't say
when buying a gun.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.428
- Mm, right.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.517
- And, uh,

03:33.561 --> 03:35.737
well, you just said
the only thing you can't say.

03:35.780 --> 03:39.480
- What if I'm dealing

03:39.523 --> 03:42.700
with a really aggressive moose.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.616
- Oh, like an Alaska Yukon or--

03:45.660 --> 03:47.270
- The kind that attacks you.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.445
- That'd be the Shiras.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.969
- Now, this moose--

03:51.013 --> 03:53.276
he also has a thing
for my wife.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.019
- Wait, what exactly
are we talking about here?

03:57.062 --> 03:59.500
- We're talking about a moose,
Sean, who breaks into my house.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.589
He threatens my kids,
has his way with my wife,

04:01.632 --> 04:03.895
and I can't seem to ever
do anything about it.

04:06.942 --> 04:09.292
- All right, well, that will...

04:09.336 --> 04:11.903
Narrow your selection
down to the Prairie Hawk,

04:11.947 --> 04:13.383
the Liberty single-shot--

04:13.427 --> 04:14.732
- Whichever's your favorite.

04:14.776 --> 04:18.823
- Uh, just a few
easy questions for you,

04:18.867 --> 04:22.740
like have you ever been
convicted of a violent crime?

04:22.784 --> 04:25.395
- No.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.745
- Ever get a not guilty verdict
by reason of insanity?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.399
- No.

04:29.443 --> 04:30.922
- Okay, well, just check "no"
for the rest of these,

04:30.966 --> 04:33.360
and we'll get back to you
in a few days, maybe a week.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.407
- Well, what if I need it
sooner?

04:37.451 --> 04:39.496
- Well, with this type
of firearm,

04:39.540 --> 04:41.324
they require us
to do a background check.

04:44.806 --> 04:48.070
- What could I walk out
with today?

04:48.113 --> 04:50.420
- He reads?

04:50.464 --> 04:52.640
- Is that an "US Weekly"?

04:52.683 --> 04:54.337
- "In Touch."

04:54.381 --> 04:55.773
Mrs. Karpinski gave it to him

04:55.817 --> 04:58.515
after he brought in
her recycling bins.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.952
- Jesus.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.519
- How does he even
go to the bathroom?

05:02.563 --> 05:04.478
- Mrs. Karpinski.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.914
- That bitch.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.482
- You guys,
I can't live like this.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.834
- Okay.
Okay, here's what we do.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.966
We go to Canada and get a baby.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.447
- Get a baby?

05:17.491 --> 05:19.536
- Well, she said
she's having his baby.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.885
We're gonna need a baby.
- What are you gonna do?

05:20.929 --> 05:22.974
pick one up with a cruller
from Tim Horton's?

05:23.018 --> 05:24.411
- Oh, my God.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.847
- That's where we got
that fake cash.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.109
I mean, who knows what else
they're hiding up there?

05:27.152 --> 05:28.850
Although we could just
pay for one.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.982
I mean, the cash exchange rate
right now up there

05:31.026 --> 05:33.115
is actually--
- You wanna buy a baby?

05:33.158 --> 05:35.683
- I want my sister to not die.

05:35.726 --> 05:36.858
- I wanna go to bed.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.516
- Nuh-uh.
- What?

05:42.559 --> 05:45.736
- You cannot be serious,
Mrs. Karpinski.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.999
- Oh, dude.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.480
- It's like she wants him
to use her bathroom.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.874
- Oh, look at this.
She got snacks on snacks now.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.140
We'll figure
something out, okay?

06:02.884 --> 06:06.061
I'm sorry.
Am I in the wrong house?

06:08.716 --> 06:11.066
What is happening?
- Dad's mad.

06:11.109 --> 06:12.894
- About what?

06:12.937 --> 06:15.026
- I got fired from tutoring.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.376
- Tell her why.

06:18.726 --> 06:21.598
- They said
I took their stupid pen.

06:21.642 --> 06:24.384
- We gave you a backpack
full of school supplies.

06:24.427 --> 06:28.518
- Mm-mm.
It's not like that.

06:28.562 --> 06:31.042
- Was it used to sign the
Declaration of Independence?

06:31.086 --> 06:33.436
- Maybe.
- What?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.656
- Yeah, they said it's some
platinum engraved fountain deal

06:35.699 --> 06:38.876
that costs as much as a car.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.487
- I didn't do it.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.836
- Hm, where have we heard
that one before?

06:41.879 --> 06:42.967
- How about their own daughter

06:43.011 --> 06:44.882
who's always vaping
and skipping class?

06:49.539 --> 06:50.801
- Okay, why don't you go
to your room

06:50.845 --> 06:53.108
so I can talk to your daddy?

06:58.200 --> 07:01.464
- You don't know she did it.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.118
- And you don't know
she didn't.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.731
- Okay, well,

07:07.775 --> 07:09.907
what do we do from here?

07:09.951 --> 07:11.779
- Oh, it's a "we"
situation now?

07:11.822 --> 07:13.824
- And that means what?

07:23.878 --> 07:26.533
- You're the resident
crime lord.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.266
- Can't sleep?
- Oh, God.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.707
Give me a ride.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.683
- What's good?

08:47.570 --> 08:50.094
- Can I get a shot of tequila?

08:50.138 --> 08:54.011
- You might wanna
slow down, yeah?

08:54.055 --> 08:57.188
- We never got to toast.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.756
One for my baby daddy here too.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.676
- What are you doing,
Elizabeth?

09:08.983 --> 09:10.941
- I lost it.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.562
- When?

09:25.303 --> 09:28.002
- Does it matter?

09:31.614 --> 09:33.311
- All right, then.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.330
- So what comes next?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.944
- Nothing good.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.383
- How much would it cost?

10:01.426 --> 10:03.124
- For what?
- My life.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.343
- Ah, nah, too late for that.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.000
- You haven't been in the game
for, what, two months?

10:10.044 --> 10:11.611
- Don't worry about it.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.091
- No pills, no cars, no cash?
It's gotta hurt.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.963
- You don't know my interests.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.971
- I know they need capital.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.277
And your guy could chop me up
in a million pieces

10:26.321 --> 10:30.107
whenever you want,
so what do you got to lose?

10:35.373 --> 10:38.986
- How much am I worth?

10:39.029 --> 10:41.162
- You couldn't afford it.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.646
- What if I could?

10:50.084 --> 10:53.827
- Okay, pros and cons.

10:57.134 --> 11:00.050
- Pro.
You're not dead yet.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.010
- How are we gonna get
100 grand?

11:03.053 --> 11:05.969
- Another pro.
- How is that a pro?

11:07.579 --> 11:09.233
- Well, he could have said,
like, 100 bucks,

11:09.277 --> 11:10.800
which would have been
way easier,

11:10.844 --> 11:13.237
but said a lot less
about you as a person.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.412
- Do you know how many ones
we're gonna have to get

11:14.456 --> 11:15.762
to print that much?

11:15.805 --> 11:17.285
- Con.
- Thank you.

11:17.328 --> 11:20.288
- It's a lot.
- Not to mention washing it.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.464
- Con.

11:22.507 --> 11:25.249
- Okay, there are gonna
be a lot more cons than pros.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.297
- How firm was he
on this number?

11:34.868 --> 11:37.479
- Hey, ladies.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.231
- What is going on?

11:50.274 --> 11:52.015
- I got floss.

11:52.059 --> 11:54.801
- Oh?
- We were out.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.454
- What else did you get, Dean?

11:56.498 --> 11:59.414
- Hm, got some razors,
deodorant.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.068
I'm gonna try these

12:01.111 --> 12:02.460
Breathe Right
nose strip thingies--

12:02.504 --> 12:04.811
- Why is there a shotgun
on our bed?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.464
- It's the only gun I can get
without a waiting period.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.815
- What if the kids find it?

12:08.858 --> 12:11.905
- I'll hide the ammo.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.169
- And what if they find that?
- They won't.

12:15.212 --> 12:16.474
- Kenny's found every one
of his Christmas gifts

12:16.518 --> 12:17.867
for the past five years.

12:17.911 --> 12:20.522
- That's 'cause you hide them.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.350
- I know you're upset--

12:22.393 --> 12:26.267
- No.
I'm terrified.

12:26.310 --> 12:30.271
- And I get that.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.273
But this isn't gonna
make him go away.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.449
- Then tell me what will.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.019
- I don't want a gun
in my house.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.585
- And I don't want the tweaker
on the front lawn

12:40.629 --> 12:44.372
reporting back to the guy who
emptied a clip in me, but hey,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.417
that's the world
we're living in.

12:50.117 --> 12:53.120
- Hmm, uh...

12:53.163 --> 12:54.382
Time.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.688
- 9 minutes, 38 seconds.
- Mm.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.299
Not bad.

12:58.342 --> 13:02.216
- Yeah, it's for preschoolers,
but congrats.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.261
- What else you got
around here?

13:06.698 --> 13:09.614
- We could talk about stuff.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.491
- How do you talk
about something

13:16.534 --> 13:18.580
that you can't talk about?

13:18.623 --> 13:21.191
- Well, just start.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.587
- I'm really worried
about my sister.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.284
- Okay.

13:30.026 --> 13:34.944
- She's dealing with something
that's very life-threatening.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.380
- Well, they say
when someone gets sick,

13:36.424 --> 13:39.427
it might as well be
the whole family.

13:39.470 --> 13:43.257
- It's just that we thought
that it was gone,

13:43.300 --> 13:45.128
and now it's back.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.913
- The big C huh?

13:46.956 --> 13:48.262
- Mmm.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.525
- What kind?

13:50.568 --> 13:53.615
- It's super rare.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.617
- I lost my mum the same way.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.662
- Oh, God.

13:57.706 --> 14:01.057
- So I've been down the road.

14:01.101 --> 14:04.278
- Yeah, it's just--it's not,
you know, one of the--

14:04.321 --> 14:08.282
like a breast cancer
or a lung--

14:08.325 --> 14:11.459
not one of
the super popular ones, so--

14:11.502 --> 14:12.982
- Try me.

14:13.026 --> 14:17.204
I-I just--

14:17.247 --> 14:19.467
I--

14:19.510 --> 14:21.948
Eye...

14:21.991 --> 14:24.080
ball...

14:24.124 --> 14:26.300
cancer.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.128
It's eyeball cancer.

14:28.171 --> 14:31.653
Just the, uh--just the one.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.524
Left one.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.004
- Retinoblastoma?

14:37.528 --> 14:40.009
- If I never hear
that word again...

14:40.053 --> 14:42.229
- That's how my mum died.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.144
- Oh, no.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.277
- Has she--
has she lost her vision yet?

14:47.321 --> 14:48.583
- Ish?

14:57.548 --> 15:01.509
- Mum always wanted to see
the Grand Canyon.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.338
I planned a whole thing.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.166
We'd stay at the lodge
on the valley floor.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.645
- It's supposed to be great.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.430
- Yeah, but, um,

15:09.473 --> 15:11.823
I got this cat 'cause I was
having a hard time dealing,

15:11.867 --> 15:14.522
and it wouldn't sleep,

15:14.565 --> 15:18.830
so I pushed the trip by a week.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.311
She went completely blind
the night before our flight.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.750
- Did you still go?

15:25.794 --> 15:27.535
- I mean,
she said it smelled amazing.

15:27.578 --> 15:31.321
That's just who she was.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.411
Um...

15:34.455 --> 15:37.545
This made me
wanna be a therapist.

15:37.588 --> 15:41.201
- "The Eye in Survivor."

15:43.464 --> 15:46.858
- You're gonna make it whether
your sister does or not.

16:02.787 --> 16:06.095
- Okay, I feel much better.
Thank you.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.705
Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:07.749 --> 16:11.753
- Same time,
same place next week.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.755
I'm gonna grab Timmy.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.757
Timmy!

16:15.800 --> 16:18.064
Timothy, come on in.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.155
- Add 350 to that.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.376
- You know you don't have to
put the dot zero zero, right?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.074
- I'm aware.
Thank you.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.772
- Plus 200.
Stan's working a bachelor party.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.729
- And I get time and a half
for nights,

16:31.773 --> 16:34.123
so put half--like, another--

16:34.167 --> 16:37.431
For, like, another hundred.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.259
No dot zero zero.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.261
- Okay, I like to see
the whole number, all right?

16:41.304 --> 16:42.610
- Where we at?

16:42.653 --> 16:46.396
- So that puts us at--
still way off.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.531
- If we didn't hit
Fine and Frugal,

16:50.574 --> 16:53.838
I had another plan.

16:53.882 --> 16:57.320
Okay, this general attitude
is why I keep things to myself.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.238
- What?

17:02.282 --> 17:03.500
- You remember when
that Kardashian got, like,

17:03.544 --> 17:05.633
a bazillion-carat
diamond necklace

17:05.676 --> 17:07.156
stolen from her hotel room
in Paris?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.811
- All right, I gotta pee.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.945
- Do you still wanna hear it?

17:26.349 --> 17:27.829
- Ooh.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.296
- The hardest part is finding
the right width because

18:00.340 --> 18:01.689
I think it has to be
of a certain quality that--

18:01.732 --> 18:03.256
- Let's go.
We gotta go.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.866
- Okay, you gotta
listen to this.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.390
It's insane, but,

18:07.434 --> 18:09.436
if we had explosives,

18:09.479 --> 18:11.916
a hypnotist,
and a military helicopter,

18:11.960 --> 18:15.224
we might be able
to pull this off.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.226
- Hang on.
Did you--did you change?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.880
- Yeah.
I got our money.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.925
- What?

18:20.969 --> 18:22.710
- It's Gordie Howe's.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.538
- That means nothing to me.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.627
- From the 1955 Stanley Cup.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.368
- Even less.

18:28.411 --> 18:31.327
- ♪ Can I have a taste
of your ice cream? ♪

18:31.371 --> 18:32.720
♪ Can I lick the crumbs
from your table? ♪

18:32.763 --> 18:35.375
- Oh, we gotta go.
- Let's go.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.377
Let's go.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.813
- ♪ Can I interfere
in your crisis? ♪

18:38.856 --> 18:42.382
♪ No, mind your own business

18:42.425 --> 18:45.428
♪ No, mind your own business

18:45.472 --> 18:47.604
- Oof!

18:58.049 --> 19:01.357
- Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

19:03.272 --> 19:05.535
- It's okay.
It's old.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.411
- I grabbed the only thing
I could think of.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.021
- What was that?

19:13.064 --> 19:14.631
- A toilet plunger.
- Smart.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.981
- But I had to use
the wood part

19:17.025 --> 19:19.462
to break the glass.

19:19.506 --> 19:23.466
- Uh, but,
what'd you hold on to?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.120
- Toothbrush.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.513
- You didn't.
- I did.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.124
- Vinegar, baking soda,
lemon juice.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.564
- Did you at least wrap some
toilet paper around it?

19:34.608 --> 19:37.306
- There was so much pressure
from the knocking.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.439
- Plunger's seen some things.

19:39.482 --> 19:43.138
- There's a volcano burger
on that menu.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.186
- Double bison patty
smothered in habanero sauce.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.449
- It comes with
bottomless chili fries.

19:49.492 --> 19:52.452
- Oh.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.497
-  Okay.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.414
- Now what?

19:58.458 --> 20:02.070
- We wait.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.767
It's gonna be worth it.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.175
- Hey.
How we doing tonight?

20:20.219 --> 20:23.439
- How do you think we're doing?

20:23.483 --> 20:25.615
- How do you even know
what this thing looks like?

20:28.444 --> 20:32.405
- The guy sent me, like,
four different angles of it.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.276
Hm?

20:34.320 --> 20:36.583
Apparently, it belonged
to his grandfather.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.156
- At what point
are we taking this too far?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.680
- This is our job, Ruby.

20:46.723 --> 20:49.291
- She's a straight A student.
- Yeah, smart like a fox.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.293
- She tutors, volunteers--

20:51.337 --> 20:54.514
- Good cover.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.342
- The other day,
I watched her bring in

20:56.385 --> 20:59.083
the Connor's trash cans
without even being asked.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.303
- Casing the joint.

21:01.347 --> 21:04.219
- She's a perfect kid.
- Yeah, and so were you.

21:16.231 --> 21:19.713
- She's not me.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.852
I need to get in there.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.425
Please.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.628
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.195
- What are you doing here?

22:07.238 --> 22:09.458
- Um, uh,

22:09.502 --> 22:11.591
I read it, so...

22:11.634 --> 22:13.767
- Already?

22:13.810 --> 22:15.421
- It's a--

22:15.464 --> 22:18.641
it's a real page turner.

22:18.685 --> 22:21.470
- Kay.

22:21.514 --> 22:25.300
- Um, hey,
can I ask you something?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.346
- Now?
- Yeah.

22:29.348 --> 22:33.395
What's going on

22:33.439 --> 22:36.659
with--with us?

22:36.703 --> 22:40.359
- What do you mean?

22:40.402 --> 22:43.884
- Well, you hugged me...

22:43.927 --> 22:45.799
- Okay.

22:45.842 --> 22:48.802
- With both arms.

22:48.845 --> 22:52.240
- That's how I hug.

22:52.283 --> 22:56.418
- It felt a little...

22:56.462 --> 22:58.899
long.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.423
- Ah, right, um,

23:01.467 --> 23:04.644
maybe I overstepped.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.429
- Maybe--

23:07.473 --> 23:09.649
maybe I liked it.

23:13.696 --> 23:17.483
- Um, I know
you're going through a lot.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.267
- Oh, no.

23:19.310 --> 23:21.443
No, no.
- There is still a line here.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.358
- Oh, come on.
Grow a pair.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.925
- We shouldn't cross it.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.710
- And where is that line,
just so I'm aware?

23:31.627 --> 23:33.455
- And to paraphrase Freud--

23:33.499 --> 23:37.459
- Don't you need
a real degree to do that?

23:37.503 --> 23:40.593
- Sometimes a hug is just a hug.

23:40.636 --> 23:44.423
- Mm.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.251
Okay.
Thank you so much, Dr. Cohen.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.217
- I'm gonna go back
to the office and count to 50.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.917
- Little spot
of something red here.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.919
- I think it's blood.

24:45.962 --> 24:49.575
- Probably from that brawl
in the third period.

24:49.618 --> 24:50.924
- Cool.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.450
- So are we good?

24:55.494 --> 24:57.757
- Let me run it past my guy.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.897
- Late night?
- Couldn't sleep.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.638
- Weren't you wearing
that yesterday?

25:09.682 --> 25:11.901
- Okay,
I can see where this is going,

25:11.945 --> 25:14.338
so just gonna cut it off
at the pass.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.515
I tried to seduce
my therapist, okay?

25:16.558 --> 25:19.561
Like, sexually.
Bone town.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.521
He straight up rejected me,
so I went home alone,

25:22.564 --> 25:24.087
drank a lethal amount
of Goldschlaeger,

25:24.131 --> 25:26.002
and fell asleep in a pile
of my own Cheetos dust.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.961
So if you wanna
rip me a new one

25:28.004 --> 25:29.789
for being four minutes late,
you go right ahead,

25:29.832 --> 25:32.574
but I'm not gonna feel
any worse than I already do.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.576
- You're in therapy?

25:34.620 --> 25:36.665
- Like, physical therapy?

25:36.709 --> 25:38.798
- Why would I be
in physical therapy?

25:38.841 --> 25:41.061
- I don't know.
'Cause of how you run?

25:41.104 --> 25:43.672
- What's wrong with how I run?

25:43.716 --> 25:46.588
- All right, ladies.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.372
Where'd y'all say you got this?

25:48.416 --> 25:50.984
- Oh, it's been in my family
for many generations.

25:51.027 --> 25:53.334
- Yeah, our grandfather
taught him how to skate.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.423
- Our great-great...
- Great-great-great...

25:55.466 --> 25:57.991
- Grandfather.
- Hm.

25:58.034 --> 26:01.124
Was he Chinese?

26:01.168 --> 26:02.648
- Huh?

26:02.691 --> 26:04.040
- 'Cause that's where
this jersey was made,

26:04.084 --> 26:05.651
like, two years ago.

26:05.694 --> 26:08.523
- Excuse me--
- Wait, it's a fake?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.525
- How much for it?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.396
- 20 bucks.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.485
- 20 bucks?

26:14.529 --> 26:15.791
- All right, 25.

26:15.835 --> 26:18.446
- Excuse me.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.448
Where did you get this?
- Limited edition.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.843
Solid platinum barrel.
18 carat nib.

26:23.886 --> 26:27.020
- Who brought it in?
- Some girl.

26:27.063 --> 26:28.717
- Like, a little blonde
druggie type?

26:28.761 --> 26:30.110
- What is going on?

26:30.153 --> 26:32.373
- Okay, I'm not interested.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.157
- Fine, we'll take the 20.

26:34.201 --> 26:37.073
- I'd like you to leave.
- Was it her?

26:40.424 --> 26:41.774
- You guys cops?

26:53.699 --> 26:55.657
- Guess what.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.137
Jesus.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.529
- Language.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.749
- You're home early.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.577
- Got some good news.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.144
- What's that?

27:04.187 --> 27:06.233
- They found the pen.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.670
- Wow.

27:08.714 --> 27:11.194
- Yeah, so I made you these.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.588
I know you've been worked up.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.377
- How is it?

27:20.421 --> 27:23.554
- Awesome.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.078
- Jesus.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.688
- What?

27:26.732 --> 27:28.690
- How do you do that?

27:28.734 --> 27:31.171
- What?
- Eat that like you deserve it.

27:38.526 --> 27:41.529
Where's the money?

27:41.572 --> 27:43.096
- Does Dad know?

27:43.139 --> 27:45.315
- Where did you hide it?

27:45.359 --> 27:48.710
- I don't have--
- Where?

27:48.754 --> 27:50.581
- Same place you hide yours.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.326
I don't know what you do,

27:56.370 --> 27:59.286
but it doesn't come
from painting nails.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.356
- What do you talk about?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.489
- Just stuff.

28:28.532 --> 28:31.318
- Like what kind of stuff?

28:31.361 --> 28:34.060
- More lo mein anyone?
Mmm, mm-hmm.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.584
- Like me?

28:36.627 --> 28:38.064
- I'm probably gonna stop going.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.848
- Oh, my God.
It's 100% me.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.589
- Okay, you know what?
Let's do fortunes.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.204
- Well, mine doesn't have one,
so that's probably not good.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.598
- Huh, let's see.

28:50.641 --> 28:54.080
"You are smarter, prettier,

28:54.123 --> 28:56.169
and much cooler
than your sibling."

28:56.212 --> 28:57.518
Wow, hm.
- That's not what it says.

28:57.561 --> 28:58.737
Show me.
- No, it does.

28:58.780 --> 28:59.694
No, it does.
Says it right here.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.174
- Give it to me.
- No!

29:01.217 --> 29:02.262
That's like telling you
my birthday wish.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.567
Fortune wants what it wants.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.484
And now it shall
be written forever.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.312
- You're the worst.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.623
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.234
Thank you.
- Thank my derelict daughter.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.583
- What are you gonna do to her?

29:19.627 --> 29:21.498
- Um, I haven't devised it yet,

29:21.542 --> 29:24.545
but it is definitely
gonna be illegal.

29:24.588 --> 29:28.288
- Okay,
let's bring home some bacon.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.875

32:12.452 --> 32:13.975
So here's the thing, man.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.324
If you wanna move

32:15.368 --> 32:16.717
your funny money
through my guys,

32:16.760 --> 32:18.284
we gotta get some stuff
straight, yeah?

32:18.327 --> 32:19.459
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

32:19.502 --> 32:20.895
- Mm-hmm!

32:20.939 --> 32:24.638
- All right, for starters,
there is a licensing fee,

32:24.681 --> 32:25.987
but, you know, if that's
gonna be an issue for you,

32:26.031 --> 32:27.075
We can just--
- Mm-mm!

32:28.555 --> 32:29.817
- No problem?
- Mm-hmm.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.297
- Good.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.734
Good, good, good,
good, good, man, good.

32:33.777 --> 32:34.996
I was hoping you'd say that.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.998
- Mm-hmm.

32:37.042 --> 32:41.002
- Now, I need to know
who your employer is

32:41.046 --> 32:43.570
'cause I don't know you.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.006
And you don't know me.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.051
I feel like
I should know everybody

32:46.094 --> 32:47.052
that I work with, right?

32:47.095 --> 32:48.357
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

32:48.401 --> 32:49.619
- Mm-hmm.

32:51.491 --> 32:54.363
- What's that now?

32:54.407 --> 32:55.974
I--

33:25.786 --> 33:27.788
- So who made your money?

33:34.055 --> 33:35.448
- I'm home.

33:35.491 --> 33:36.971
- Hey, babe.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.668
I got your food
warming in the oven.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.888
- Ah, okay.

33:40.931 --> 33:42.629
You got a test tomorrow?

33:42.672 --> 33:44.544
- Algebra.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.677
- Hm.

33:50.550 --> 33:52.900
So your mama told me
what happened.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.822
So what now?

34:01.865 --> 34:03.432
Stevensons gonna give her
that job back?

34:03.476 --> 34:05.086
- Ooh.
It's up to her.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.048
- I mean, either way,
they owe our family an apology.

34:12.398 --> 34:15.096
All right,
gotta wash this day off first.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.663
I love you.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.110
- Why didn't you tell him?

34:29.154 --> 34:32.113
- Because it would
break his heart.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.898
- What if he runs into
Mr. Stevenson somewhere?

34:34.942 --> 34:37.640
- Well,
that's the problem, isn't it?

34:37.684 --> 34:39.077
You make up one story,

34:39.120 --> 34:41.166
then you gotta make up
another to cover that story.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.863
Before you know it,

34:42.906 --> 34:44.604
you can't keep
any of them straight.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.084
- Am I grounded?

34:46.127 --> 34:48.521
- That's for kids.

34:48.564 --> 34:51.698
You're big-time now.
You're a criminal.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.572
- So what's that mean?

34:56.616 --> 34:58.574
- You're gonna owe me.

35:07.540 --> 35:09.933
- Hey, need a hand?

35:09.977 --> 35:13.111
- Well, aren't you full service?

35:13.154 --> 35:14.764
- You've missed two sessions.

35:14.808 --> 35:17.115
- Stalking included.
- I got worried.

35:19.856 --> 35:22.120
- Look, there's no point, okay?
I made it weird.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.165
- We should talk about that.
- And make it weirder?

35:24.209 --> 35:26.863
- It's called transference.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.952
When people make progress
in therapy,

35:28.996 --> 35:31.868
it's not uncommon to,

35:31.912 --> 35:34.915
you know, develop, like, a crush
on the person helping them.

35:34.958 --> 35:38.614
- Okay, well, this right now
is definitely not helping,

35:38.658 --> 35:41.051
and I have stuff to do, so...

35:45.143 --> 35:48.189
- All right.
See you.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.192
- I'll, uh,
go back in my apartment,

35:51.236 --> 35:54.978
count to 50.

35:55.022 --> 35:56.719
- You know what I think?

35:59.244 --> 36:01.811
You have a storied history

36:01.855 --> 36:04.858
of pursuing inaccessible men,

36:04.901 --> 36:08.818
which is a defense mechanism
to protect you from rejection.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.908
In fact, you do that
with a lot in your life.

36:11.952 --> 36:14.607
I mean, why pursue anything
that would make you happy

36:14.650 --> 36:17.827
when there's a chance
you might not get it, right?

36:17.871 --> 36:20.090
And you put all that
under a nice thick layer

36:20.134 --> 36:22.136
of sex and sarcasm

36:22.180 --> 36:24.660
that makes you bulletproof
to any real emotion.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.275
But, uh, you know, hey.
What do I know?

36:30.318 --> 36:32.842
I graduated
bottom of my class online.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.979
- You can't charge me for that.

36:39.022 --> 36:42.635
- If you don't come back,
I've gotta fill your spot.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.211
- Hey, have you seen my purse?

36:53.254 --> 36:56.692
- The, um--
the ammo's in the office.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.695
The gun is in the garage

36:59.739 --> 37:02.045
with the lawn stuff.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.265
- How would you ever get to it?

37:04.309 --> 37:07.181
- I just like knowing
it's there.

37:11.229 --> 37:14.057
- Okay.

37:14.101 --> 37:16.712
- We were so good
with him gone.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.146
Purse is on the couch.

38:07.241 --> 38:09.765
- I'll be right with you.

38:11.898 --> 38:13.813
- Hey, now.

38:21.995 --> 38:24.606
- I don't have it all
right now, okay?

38:24.650 --> 38:27.130
- I'm not here for that.

38:27.174 --> 38:30.003
I'm just here for some
custom printing.

38:30.046 --> 38:33.311
Word is you do the best work.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.663
I'd like to see how it's done.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.142
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:39.186 --> 38:42.232
- Oh, no?

38:42.276 --> 38:44.931
'Cause your friend
says you do.

38:49.196 --> 38:51.241
I wanna see.

38:53.461 --> 38:56.769
- Well, he's got it wrong.
