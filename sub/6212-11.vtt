WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:04.435
Ooh...hold it right there!

00:07.571 --> 00:08.405
Ah, beautiful.

00:08.639 --> 00:09.640
Easy for you to say.

00:09.974 --> 00:11.609
You can't see what's
in the bottom of this.

00:11.675 --> 00:14.879
I think I'll call that one,
"Girl With Cup."

00:17.181 --> 00:18.582
I've got a better
picture for you...

00:18.816 --> 00:20.251
"Girl Doing Job."

00:20.851 --> 00:22.853
You know, I could shoot
a whole series on this.

00:23.821 --> 00:25.623
"A day in the life of
a minimum-wage slave."

00:26.624 --> 00:28.025
Oh, I'm flattered,
yet oddly put off.

00:28.592 --> 00:30.594
You must be pretty
jazzed about this
whole photography thing.

00:31.262 --> 00:32.296
I'm loving it.

00:32.296 --> 00:34.498
After three years
of just bouncing around

00:34.498 --> 00:35.900
and shelling out tuition

00:35.900 --> 00:37.668
I found the secret
to enjoying a major.

00:37.668 --> 00:39.270
Not changing it
every two weeks?

00:39.270 --> 00:41.772
No, picking something
you're totally
excited about.

00:41.772 --> 00:43.340
I mean, this is
the first class

00:43.340 --> 00:45.609
where I actually enjoy
doing the assignments.

00:45.609 --> 00:47.478
Well, maybe you'd enjoy
doing mine.

00:47.478 --> 00:48.479
I'm serious.

00:48.479 --> 00:50.181
I think I could
turn this into a career.

00:50.181 --> 00:51.916
That's great.
That's awesome.

00:51.916 --> 00:53.317
It's amazing you
found something

00:53.317 --> 00:54.685
to be passionate
about.

00:54.685 --> 00:57.254
Yeah, for a while I was afraid
I'd be making espressos

00:57.254 --> 00:59.657
and scrubbing coffee pots
the rest of my life.

00:59.657 --> 01:03.394
I'd be happy if
you just did it
the rest of the day.

01:03.394 --> 01:06.030
Yikes, I wonder what I should
call that photo.

01:06.030 --> 01:09.967
Oh, how about "Boss's Brilliance
Eclipsed Only By Her Beauty."

01:09.967 --> 01:12.636
Make me double prints.

01:17.541 --> 01:24.348
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:24.348 --> 01:30.221
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:30.221 --> 01:33.691
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:33.691 --> 01:39.864

01:53.644 --> 01:55.446
( <i>Doorbell rings</i> )

01:55.446 --> 01:56.480
It can't be the Avon lady.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.481
She's gone dot-com.

01:57.481 --> 01:59.049
You expecting anyone?

01:59.049 --> 02:01.385
No, but if it's G-men,
last you heard

02:01.385 --> 02:05.489
Miles Goodman is a towel boy,
Club Med Pakistan.

02:07.358 --> 02:08.459
Oh, no G-men

02:08.459 --> 02:09.593
but we got the J-man.

02:09.593 --> 02:10.794
What's going on, Josh?

02:10.794 --> 02:13.464
Oh, nothing major,
just my whole
world crumbling.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.332
That doesn't sound
good. Come on in.

02:15.332 --> 02:16.734
Thanks, Sabrina.

02:16.734 --> 02:18.702
You know, it's a good thing
I have someone

02:18.702 --> 02:21.071
who's sensitive, caring,
and always there for me.

02:21.071 --> 02:22.373
Thanks.

02:22.373 --> 02:23.374
I meant Morgan.

02:23.374 --> 02:24.742
Could you go tell her
I'm here?

02:24.742 --> 02:26.911
I would, but she's
in New York shopping.

02:26.911 --> 02:29.513
Apparently your
sensitive girlfriend
forgot to tell you.

02:29.513 --> 02:30.981
Oh, man!

02:30.981 --> 02:32.516
Why does Morgan
have to be gone

02:32.516 --> 02:34.752
on the same day
I find out I have no talent.

02:34.752 --> 02:36.120
Who said you
have no talent?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.955
My professor.

02:37.955 --> 02:39.056
I showed him some
of the photographs I took

02:39.056 --> 02:40.424
and he said
they were "ho-hum."

02:40.424 --> 02:42.526
Big deal! What does
that bozo know anyway?

02:42.526 --> 02:44.995
That bozo spent 20 years
at <i>Life</i> magazine

02:44.995 --> 02:46.497
and shot over 50 covers.

02:46.497 --> 02:47.765
So, who reads
<i>Life</i> magazine?

02:47.765 --> 02:49.266
People only look
at it for the...

02:49.266 --> 02:50.200
The pictures!

02:50.200 --> 02:52.736
Obviously, I don't have
what it takes

02:52.736 --> 02:54.204
to be a photographer.

02:54.204 --> 02:55.839
I can't believe
you're calling it quits

02:55.839 --> 02:57.274
after one off-the-cuff comment.

02:57.274 --> 02:59.476
He must've said something
encouraging about your work.

02:59.476 --> 03:02.413
Yeah, sure, he said
I had some potential.

03:02.413 --> 03:05.316
But he called my pictures
"pedestrian."

03:05.316 --> 03:07.318
But "potential" is good.

03:07.318 --> 03:09.153
And "pedestrian"
isn't so bad either.

03:09.153 --> 03:10.821
I mean,
whenever I cross the street

03:10.821 --> 03:12.589
I am proud
to be a pedestrian...whoo!

03:12.589 --> 03:16.360
Nice try, but I'm seeing
a lot of lattes
in my future.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.728
You know,
nobody's an expert

03:17.728 --> 03:19.096
when they start out.

03:19.096 --> 03:21.799
You think Mozart just plopped
himself down in front of a piano

03:21.799 --> 03:23.667
and started
playing concertos?

03:23.667 --> 03:27.304
Okay, bad example.

03:27.304 --> 03:28.072
Look, the point is

03:28.072 --> 03:29.740
it takes years
to develop a craft.

03:29.740 --> 03:30.708
Look at my
Aunts Hilda and Zelda.

03:30.708 --> 03:31.976
Which craft
did they develop?

03:31.976 --> 03:33.744
Witchcraft, who
said anything

03:33.744 --> 03:34.678
about
witchcraft?

03:34.678 --> 03:35.913
I like
your pictures.

03:35.913 --> 03:37.314
Well, some of the students

03:37.314 --> 03:39.683
did say nice things
about "Bird on a Stoop."

03:39.683 --> 03:41.218
Well, then, get out there.

03:41.218 --> 03:42.720
Shoot more birds,
more stoops.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.787
This is your passion.

03:43.787 --> 03:45.022
You have to go after it!

03:45.022 --> 03:46.056
You really think so?

03:46.056 --> 03:47.057
I know so.

03:47.057 --> 03:48.459
And you heard it

03:48.459 --> 03:52.096
from one of the world's
greatest pedestrians.

03:52.096 --> 03:52.930
Hey, Aunt Hilda

03:52.930 --> 03:54.565
you know how you're always
looking for new ways

03:54.565 --> 03:56.233
to bring in people
to the coffeehouse?

03:56.233 --> 03:56.834
You mean, like last week

03:56.834 --> 04:00.671
when I started that rumor
that Brad Pitt
had been spotted here?

04:00.671 --> 04:01.972
That was a rumor?

04:01.972 --> 04:03.207
I worked extra shifts!

04:03.207 --> 04:05.109
Wow!

04:05.109 --> 04:06.777
There really is one born
every minute.

04:06.777 --> 04:09.179
Anyway, I thought
of a great new idea
to bring in business.

04:09.179 --> 04:11.448
Let local artists
display their work here.

04:11.448 --> 04:13.650
I'm not exactly
bouncing off the walls.

04:13.650 --> 04:19.356
You get a percentage
of whatever they sell.

04:19.356 --> 04:21.091
I'll take that
as a "yes."

04:21.091 --> 04:22.826
And you know,
it's not just
about money.

04:22.826 --> 04:25.729
The coffeehouse could
become a famous
watering hole for artists.

04:25.729 --> 04:28.799
Like the great salons
of gay Paree.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.601
I could be a patron
of the arts...

04:30.601 --> 04:33.103
An inspiration
to young talent...

04:36.106 --> 04:53.390
( <i>speaks French</i> )

04:53.390 --> 04:53.991
<i>Great!</i>

04:53.991 --> 04:55.859
so where do we find
our first artist
to sponge off?

04:55.859 --> 04:57.594
What a coincidence.

04:57.594 --> 04:58.495
I think I see one now.

04:58.495 --> 04:59.496
Josh?

04:59.496 --> 05:00.898
He can't even draw the blinds.

05:00.898 --> 05:02.399
He's a really
talented photographer.

05:02.399 --> 05:03.400
Hey, guess what!

05:03.400 --> 05:04.668
My aunt wants you
to display

05:04.668 --> 05:06.070
some of your
photographs here.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.571
Are you serious?

05:07.571 --> 05:08.338
Absolutely.

05:08.338 --> 05:11.108
My <i>raison d'etra is</i>
to encourage creativity

05:11.108 --> 05:12.609
enlightenment, vision...

05:12.609 --> 05:15.946
Cash only. All sales are final.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.883
Very powerful imagery.

05:19.883 --> 05:20.551
Thank you.

05:20.551 --> 05:22.119
I love the way
the oak tree's beauty

05:22.119 --> 05:25.422
is juxtaposed against the
hideousness of acid rain.

05:25.422 --> 05:27.357
Oh, that's an iced mocha

05:27.357 --> 05:29.059
someone splashed on it.

05:29.059 --> 05:31.395
Oh.

05:32.096 --> 05:35.032
I love it-- the perfect
melding of art
and menial labor.

05:35.032 --> 05:36.967
Sabrina, nobody's liking
my stuff.

05:36.967 --> 05:39.002
I think this whole idea
was a bust.

05:39.002 --> 05:41.063
Oh, that's not true. Its
going great!

05:41.063 --> 05:41.841
I mean, look...

05:41.841 --> 05:43.006
that woman is checking
out your work.

05:43.006 --> 05:46.510
She's checking for spinach
in her teeth.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.816
Remind me again, what is
ten percent of <i>nothing?</i>

05:52.816 --> 05:55.319
Aunt Hilda, you've got
to have a little patience.

05:55.319 --> 05:56.487
I mean, you know the saying:

05:56.487 --> 05:58.355
"Moulin Rouge
wasn't built in a day."

05:58.355 --> 05:59.656
That was Rome.

05:59.656 --> 06:02.092
And if they had listened
to me instead of
that dufus Caesar

06:02.092 --> 06:03.460
it would've been
done by noon.

06:05.129 --> 06:06.797
Look, Sabrina,
I know you meant well

06:06.797 --> 06:08.599
but the public has spoken.

06:08.599 --> 06:10.300
My photos stink.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.536
Wait, Josh, wait...

06:12.536 --> 06:13.704
Brilliant!

06:13.704 --> 06:14.605
Look over there.

06:14.605 --> 06:15.497
Excuse me,

06:15.497 --> 06:16.406
Who do I talk to
about buying this?

06:16.406 --> 06:17.407
Me.

06:17.407 --> 06:18.475
Did you hear that?

06:18.475 --> 06:19.643
Someone wants
to buy my photo!

06:19.643 --> 06:22.479
No kidding,that's great!

06:22.479 --> 06:24.314
Exquisite, isn't it?

06:24.314 --> 06:25.716
We'd like to purchase
this piece.

06:25.716 --> 06:28.018
Sorry, this gentleman
already asked about it.

06:28.018 --> 06:29.887
I'll give you $800 for it.

06:29.887 --> 06:32.189
However, no deal is final until
the check clears.

06:32.189 --> 06:34.024
$800? Did you
hear that?

06:34.024 --> 06:35.559
I'm willing to pay $1,000.

06:35.559 --> 06:37.761
$1,000 for that?

06:37.761 --> 06:39.296
He'll take it!

06:39.296 --> 06:42.299
Congratulations, you are now
the proud owner
of "Cat Without Shame."

06:42.299 --> 06:44.701
My wife's going to love it.

06:44.701 --> 06:47.471
Apparently he's married
to "Wife Without Taste."

06:47.471 --> 06:49.206
Whoo-hoo...you sold
your first photograph!

06:49.206 --> 06:51.475
Yeah, for 1,000 bucks.

06:51.475 --> 06:52.910
Not so fast,
Ansel Adams.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.111
One of those C-notes

06:54.111 --> 06:56.547
is mine.

06:56.547 --> 06:59.950
Someone actually paid money
for a picture of you?

06:59.950 --> 07:01.518
That's right, toots.

07:01.518 --> 07:05.255
1,000 smackeroos
for Saberhagen in the buff.

07:05.255 --> 07:07.758
You're sure it wasn't
pesos or lira?

07:07.758 --> 07:10.260
Face it,
I'm a natural-born star.

07:10.260 --> 07:13.230
Zellie,
I'm ready for my close-up.

07:13.230 --> 07:16.333
Trust me, you have no future
in show business.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.468
I've already got one paw
in the door.

07:18.468 --> 07:20.304
Read this.

07:20.304 --> 07:24.174
Hmm, "Open auditions for Little
Wussies Cat Food commercial."

07:24.174 --> 07:25.976
I faxed my head shot
this morning.

07:25.976 --> 07:28.512
The one
with the "come hither" look.

07:28.512 --> 07:31.014
Just how do you plan
to get to this audition?

07:31.014 --> 07:32.783
Purr, I love you...

07:32.783 --> 07:35.319
I assure you, that is not
helping your case.

07:35.319 --> 07:38.055
Please, Zelda,
let me follow my dream!

07:38.055 --> 07:39.356
I'm a college professor.

07:39.356 --> 07:41.325
I don't have time
to be your chauffeur.

07:41.325 --> 07:42.526
How about my co-star?

07:42.526 --> 07:43.627
They want real pets

07:43.627 --> 07:45.329
and real owners
in the commercial.

07:45.329 --> 07:47.564
Oh, Salem,
I'm not an actress.

07:47.564 --> 07:50.801
Are you interested in what is
or what could be?

07:50.801 --> 07:55.305
Just look at that face.

07:55.305 --> 07:58.842
Well, it is uncommonly
symmetrical.

07:58.842 --> 08:01.245
You want to hide
those perfect cheekbones

08:01.245 --> 08:02.546
behind a physics book

08:02.546 --> 08:05.115
or share them with those
who weren't as blessed?

08:05.115 --> 08:08.018
Well, I wouldn't want
to be selfish.

08:08.018 --> 08:09.419
That's my girl.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.824
Oh, I'm good.

08:13.824 --> 08:16.260
I'm real good.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.862
Josh, didn't my aunt tell
you to clean up the back?

08:18.862 --> 08:20.264
Uh, yeah, I'll get to it.

08:20.264 --> 08:21.398
Hey, I'm thinking of shooting

08:21.398 --> 08:23.467
a whole series
on asphalt driveways.

08:23.467 --> 08:25.202
Wouldn't that be
a huge seller?

08:25.202 --> 08:27.271
Me, I'm more of
a cement kind of gal.

08:27.271 --> 08:28.672
But let's face it, you know

08:28.672 --> 08:30.874
selling art is a hit-
or-miss kind of thing.

08:30.874 --> 08:32.709
Some artists go years
between sales.

08:32.709 --> 08:34.611
Well, maybe you
didn't hear me.

08:34.611 --> 08:35.746
I said asphalt.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.215
Josh, I don't mean
to be, um...

08:38.215 --> 08:39.549
oh, what is it called...

08:39.549 --> 08:40.684
your boss?

08:40.684 --> 08:41.818
But would you mind

08:41.818 --> 08:43.387
reacquainting
yourself with a broom?

08:43.387 --> 08:45.155
Hilda, relax.

08:45.155 --> 08:47.124
I'm the guy that's
turning your coffeehouse

08:47.124 --> 08:48.859
into one of the world's
great salons.

08:48.859 --> 08:52.195
And everybody loves
a clean salon.

08:52.195 --> 08:54.665
That's a beautiful cat.

08:54.665 --> 08:55.832
Oh, thanks.

08:55.832 --> 08:58.702
We just had Mandy's
highlights done.

08:58.702 --> 09:00.871
Your cat gets highlights?

09:00.871 --> 09:02.939
Oh, they're worth
every penny.

09:02.939 --> 09:05.042
Mandy's been raking in
the magazine work

09:05.042 --> 09:07.177
since we gave her
the silver weave.

09:07.177 --> 09:09.980
You know, you might
want to do something

09:09.980 --> 09:11.948
with your little alley cat.

09:11.948 --> 09:14.484
His coat does look a bit dull.

09:14.484 --> 09:17.220
( <i>hissing</i> )

09:17.220 --> 09:19.089
Miss Spellman,
we're ready for you and Salem.

09:19.089 --> 09:21.358
Well, come on, Salem.

09:21.358 --> 09:23.360
I mean, here, kitty, kitty.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.729
Here, kitty, kitty.

09:25.729 --> 09:30.200
Mandy, what happened to
your diamond collar?

09:30.200 --> 09:34.071
WOMAN:
This is Zelda Spellman
and Salem.

09:34.638 --> 09:36.940
-Simply
beautiful...
-Oh...

09:36.940 --> 09:38.709
Cat's a little scruffy, though.

09:38.709 --> 09:39.910
WOMAN:
Now, Zelda--

09:39.910 --> 09:41.978
you'll say your line

09:41.978 --> 09:44.514
then you put down
the bowl of Little Wussies

09:44.514 --> 09:46.383
and Salem will
come running to eat it.

09:46.383 --> 09:47.150
Got it.

09:47.150 --> 09:50.020
Ready... and action.

09:50.020 --> 09:53.156
Fluffy is such a picky eater.

09:53.156 --> 09:55.992
I've tried 40 kinds
of cat food

09:55.992 --> 09:59.329
and he turned up his nose
at all of them.

09:59.329 --> 10:02.599
I sure hope he likes
Little Wussies.

10:02.599 --> 10:04.201
MAN:
Excellent.

10:04.201 --> 10:06.570
We'll see you at
callbacks on Friday.

10:06.570 --> 10:07.838
Did you hear that, Salem?

10:07.838 --> 10:09.005
We made the final cut.

10:09.005 --> 10:11.174
But you'll need to work
with the cat.

10:11.174 --> 10:12.509
He's way over the top.

10:12.509 --> 10:13.410
Well...

10:13.410 --> 10:16.613
I'm sure he'll get it
right next time.

10:16.613 --> 10:19.750
After all, he is
a natural-born star.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.651
And a diamond thief!

10:21.651 --> 10:23.987
Excuse me, Miss,
how much is this photo?

10:23.987 --> 10:25.589
You mean you want to buy it?

10:25.589 --> 10:27.190
Like, of your own free will?

10:27.190 --> 10:28.458
It is for sale, isn't it?

10:28.458 --> 10:30.260
You bet it is, let's go
talk to the artist.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.796
Hey, Josh, great news.

10:32.796 --> 10:35.565
This customer is interested in
"Dog on Credenza with Cat."

10:35.565 --> 10:36.800
I work for a vet.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.202
It'd be perfect
in the office.

10:39.202 --> 10:41.938
I'll give you $50 for it.

10:41.938 --> 10:43.473
( <i>laughing</i> ):
$50!

10:43.473 --> 10:46.143
Buddy, that won't even
cover the sales tax.

10:46.143 --> 10:49.780
Josh, that's more than you
make in a day's tips

10:49.780 --> 10:51.815
and more important, he
appreciates your work.

10:51.815 --> 10:53.049
Sabrina

10:53.049 --> 10:56.420
my photograph of your cat
sold for $1,000.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.221
This shot has
a cat and a dog so

10:58.221 --> 10:59.689
it's worth
at least 2,000.

10:59.689 --> 11:01.391
That's too rich for my blood.

11:01.391 --> 11:04.094
You know, they say an artist's
body of work

11:04.094 --> 11:06.396
actually quadruples
after he's dead.

11:06.396 --> 11:07.431
Your point being?

11:07.431 --> 11:09.065
If you're not
behind that counter

11:09.065 --> 11:09.966
in 30 seconds,
you're going to be

11:09.966 --> 11:11.601
one rich stiff.

11:11.601 --> 11:12.936
Hey, don't talk to me like that.

11:12.936 --> 11:14.604
You're $100 richer
because of me.

11:14.604 --> 11:15.906
A hundred dollars!

11:15.906 --> 11:17.307
I'm going to Prada!

11:17.307 --> 11:19.443
Okay, I think we all need
to take a deep breath

11:19.443 --> 11:21.244
calm down, and
remember why we're here.

11:21.244 --> 11:23.413
To get America hopped up
on caffeine.

11:23.413 --> 11:24.448
Thank you.

11:24.448 --> 11:25.782
Maybe you'll listen to her.

11:25.782 --> 11:26.917
Okay, all right.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.085
I think I see
what's going on here

11:29.085 --> 11:30.921
and Hilda, I'm sorry.

11:30.921 --> 11:31.988
Thank you.

11:31.988 --> 11:33.323
What are you sorry for?

11:33.323 --> 11:35.992
I feel bad that
I have the talent

11:35.992 --> 11:38.295
to develop this
exciting new career

11:38.295 --> 11:40.363
and you're going to
be stuck grinding beans

11:40.363 --> 11:41.198
the rest of your life.

11:41.198 --> 11:41.832
Josh!

11:41.832 --> 11:44.334
Actually, grinding beans
is the employees' job

11:44.334 --> 11:46.703
which at this point,
is hanging by a thread.

11:46.703 --> 11:47.804
Is that a threat?

11:47.804 --> 11:49.739
Ooh! Talented
<i>and</i> smart.

11:49.739 --> 11:51.441
Okay, you can save
the witty repartee.

11:51.441 --> 11:54.177
Oh, did you hear that,
he called you witty.

11:54.177 --> 11:54.945
I quit.

11:54.945 --> 11:57.214
Josh, wait.

11:58.248 --> 11:59.649
Aunt Hilda,
it's not his fault.

11:59.649 --> 12:00.984
Of course it's his fault.

12:00.984 --> 12:02.319
Who else inflated his ego?

12:02.319 --> 12:04.387
Thought he was God's
gift to photography?

12:04.387 --> 12:05.922
Made him think he was
too good to do his job?

12:05.922 --> 12:08.692
Can I get back to you on that?

12:13.463 --> 12:15.265
It is still
inconceivable to me

12:15.265 --> 12:17.434
to think that someone
paid Josh 1,000 bucks

12:17.434 --> 12:19.402
for a picture of Salem.

12:19.402 --> 12:20.437
Would it be more
conceivable

12:20.437 --> 12:23.006
if that someone
were under a spell?

12:23.006 --> 12:24.774
You didn't?

12:24.774 --> 12:26.076
Josh just seemed
so depressed

12:26.076 --> 12:27.677
when he wasn't
selling any pictures

12:27.677 --> 12:29.546
so I thought I'd
give him a little
confidence booster.

12:29.546 --> 12:31.181
You boosted his confidence
all right.

12:31.181 --> 12:32.682
It's amazing his body
can still support

12:32.682 --> 12:34.217
that beach ball of a head.

12:34.217 --> 12:35.051
Do you know of any spells

12:35.051 --> 12:36.520
that can help deflate
a guy's ego?

12:37.087 --> 12:40.156
Only Mother Nature's remedy--
male-pattern baldness.

12:40.524 --> 12:42.192
Great. Now what
am I going to do?

12:42.192 --> 12:44.127
Oh, you won't have
to do anything.

12:44.127 --> 12:47.397
The real world will pummel
that poor kid down to size.

12:47.397 --> 12:50.934
Before you know it,
he'll come crawling
through those doors.

12:50.934 --> 12:53.737
I'll save a space
for that picture right here.

12:53.737 --> 12:57.474
I'll call it "Employee Comes
Back With Tail Between Legs

12:57.474 --> 12:59.709
"Begging for Job
While Boss Tries

12:59.709 --> 13:02.178
to Find Shorter Name
for Picture."

13:02.178 --> 13:03.246
Titles are tough.

13:07.551 --> 13:09.886
Hey, Miles, did
anyone call?

13:09.886 --> 13:11.488
Yes, an unidentified source

13:11.488 --> 13:13.256
made contact on
my gamma scan.

13:13.256 --> 13:14.824
No, I meant for me.

13:14.824 --> 13:16.726
Oh, Josh called.

13:16.726 --> 13:18.862
Oh, great. Did he happen
to say what a big mistake it was

13:18.862 --> 13:20.530
for him to just up and quit
the coffeehouse?

13:20.530 --> 13:22.432
Close. He said he's
never setting foot

13:22.432 --> 13:23.600
in the Java Jam again.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.634
Great.

13:24.634 --> 13:25.902
And... oh, yeah.

13:25.902 --> 13:28.338
He took the money he made
and rented gallery space

13:28.338 --> 13:30.607
to have a showing
of his work on Friday.

13:30.607 --> 13:32.475
He sells one photograph
and he's going

13:32.475 --> 13:34.311
to give himself a
gallery exhibition?

13:34.311 --> 13:35.478
Who's going to show up?

13:35.478 --> 13:37.547
I'll go. I think his stuff
is pretty good.

13:37.547 --> 13:38.582
You do?

13:38.582 --> 13:40.450
Yeah, but I also
like to lick the tops

13:40.450 --> 13:41.751
of nine-volt
batteries.

13:41.751 --> 13:44.454
Well, if you think he's good
and I think he's good

13:44.454 --> 13:46.723
there's no reason
we can't get other people
to come see his work.

13:46.723 --> 13:48.592
We just have to get out there
and spread the word.

13:48.592 --> 13:49.593
Tell all your friends.

13:49.593 --> 13:51.194
You already
know, and Roxie's

13:51.194 --> 13:53.263
out of town at
her family reunion.

13:53.263 --> 13:54.965
That was easy.

13:54.965 --> 13:56.066
Miles, I'm desperate.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.400
Get anybody-- your shrink

13:57.400 --> 13:59.636
the head
of your Dungeon & Dragons club.

13:59.636 --> 14:04.374
Wait. Your shrink is the head
of your Dungeons & Dragons club.

14:04.374 --> 14:07.143
( <i>imitating Marlon Brando</i> ):
I could've been someone.

14:07.143 --> 14:08.345
I could've had class.

14:08.345 --> 14:10.747
I could've been
a contender.

14:10.747 --> 14:12.115
Salem, what are you doing?

14:12.115 --> 14:13.149
You're the cat.

14:13.149 --> 14:14.384
The cat doesn't have lines.

14:14.384 --> 14:16.786
I know. I'm getting
into character.

14:16.786 --> 14:18.221
I'm a method actor.

14:18.221 --> 14:20.156
What you are
is a bad actor.

14:20.156 --> 14:21.224
Oh, yeah?

14:21.224 --> 14:23.627
Have you ever tasted
Little Wussies?

14:23.627 --> 14:25.261
I'm acting my tail off.

14:25.261 --> 14:28.832
If only I had someone
decent feeding me lines.

14:28.832 --> 14:30.200
May I remind you

14:30.200 --> 14:32.669
that I'm the one the
director complimented.

14:32.669 --> 14:33.937
May I remind <i>you</i>

14:33.937 --> 14:36.373
that your skirt was
hiked up to your nostrils.

14:36.373 --> 14:38.842
If that's how my generosity
is going to be rewarded

14:38.842 --> 14:41.344
you can just find yourself
another quantum physicist

14:41.344 --> 14:42.545
to help you push kibble.

14:42.545 --> 14:43.680
Zelda, don't go.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.081
This is my process.

14:45.081 --> 14:46.316
I'm a temperamental actor.

14:46.316 --> 14:48.585
I have pictures of you
with the Brothers Grimm.

14:48.585 --> 14:51.655
All right, let's
take it from the top.

14:51.655 --> 14:53.189
Hey, thanks for coming.

14:53.189 --> 14:55.892
Hey, free cheese and
crackers? I'm there.

14:55.892 --> 14:56.893
JOSH:
Oh, hey guys.

14:56.893 --> 15:00.196
Oh, hey, Josh.
Great turnout.

15:00.196 --> 15:02.599
Guess you got your money's worth
out of that <i>Pennysaver</i> ad.

15:02.599 --> 15:03.967
Oh, it wasn't just the ad.

15:03.967 --> 15:06.503
Obviously the guy who bought
"Cat Without Shame"

15:06.503 --> 15:07.937
was so blown away
by my work

15:07.937 --> 15:10.807
that he spread the word
to his friends
in the art community.

15:10.807 --> 15:12.642
Uh-huh. Works for me.

15:12.642 --> 15:15.078
Excuse me. Are you
the photographer?

15:15.078 --> 15:17.113
Well, I've taken
a few photos.

15:17.113 --> 15:20.517
But my subjects can't
be seen with the naked eye.

15:20.517 --> 15:21.584
I think this is the gentleman

15:21.584 --> 15:22.852
you wanted
to speak to right here.

15:22.852 --> 15:23.887
It's his show.

15:23.887 --> 15:25.955
Great. Maybe you can
help us settle a debate.

15:25.955 --> 15:27.023
I'd love to.

15:27.023 --> 15:28.858
Is this longhorn
cheddar or Vermont?

15:28.858 --> 15:29.893
Oh, I'll look into that.

15:29.893 --> 15:31.795
Um, Josh, why don't you
go introduce yourself

15:31.795 --> 15:34.264
to that person over there
admiring that picture?

15:36.032 --> 15:37.734
Well, I see I'm not
the only one

15:37.734 --> 15:39.302
who likes to stop
and smell the roses.

15:39.302 --> 15:40.837
Pretty cool, huh?

15:40.837 --> 15:42.238
Beyond cool.

15:42.238 --> 15:44.340
You can totally
feel the vibe

15:44.340 --> 15:47.043
of the extraterrestrial
hiding in this unopened bud.

15:47.043 --> 15:48.144
Friend of Miles'?

15:48.144 --> 15:51.481
As far as I know, he's
still in Pakistan.

15:51.481 --> 15:54.050
Uh, Josh, this is Ethan
from <i>Photo Op</i> Magazine.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.719
He says they're always looking

15:55.719 --> 15:57.854
for interesting new artists
to publish.

15:57.854 --> 15:59.889
Well, I'm new
and interesting.

15:59.889 --> 16:02.392
I think the real question
is whether your magazine

16:02.392 --> 16:04.260
is hip and cutting-edge enough
for me.

16:04.260 --> 16:08.264
Uh, all that talent
and a sense of humor.

16:08.264 --> 16:09.733
My pieces concentrate

16:09.733 --> 16:12.402
on the intent
behind an artist's work.

16:12.402 --> 16:15.705
Was "Bird on Stool"
a visual metaphor

16:15.705 --> 16:17.574
for Man's isolation

16:17.574 --> 16:21.778
in a soulless,
technology-driven world?

16:21.778 --> 16:23.646
Actually, I was just waiting
for the bus

16:23.646 --> 16:26.583
and I wanted to get a picture
of the bird before he flew away.

16:26.583 --> 16:27.650
And?

16:27.650 --> 16:29.419
And there's the picture.

16:29.419 --> 16:30.520
So there was no

16:30.520 --> 16:32.722
aesthetic vision
behind the piece?

16:32.722 --> 16:35.859
I just liked the bird.

16:35.859 --> 16:38.561
Photography is more
than just pointing a camera

16:38.561 --> 16:40.330
at whatever crosses your path.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.398
A good photographer
should be trying

16:42.398 --> 16:46.503
to convey an emotion
or a point of view

16:46.503 --> 16:48.805
through his pictures.

16:48.805 --> 16:52.242
As opposed to me, who's just
a ho-hum pedestrian?

16:52.242 --> 16:53.209
Excuse me?

16:53.209 --> 16:54.911
Uh, cheese?

16:54.911 --> 16:57.080
We've been having
an interesting debate.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.048
Is this longhorn cheddar
or Vermont?

16:59.048 --> 17:01.851
I think that more thought
went into the cheese platters

17:01.851 --> 17:03.887
than the photographs
hanging on the wall.

17:03.887 --> 17:05.054
That's not true.

17:05.054 --> 17:08.124
These came ready-made
from Costco.

17:08.124 --> 17:10.026
Well, you blew it.

17:10.026 --> 17:12.195
Not only did you race
through your lines

17:12.195 --> 17:13.863
but on the day
of our callback

17:13.863 --> 17:15.298
you dressed like
Bea Arthur.

17:15.298 --> 17:16.299
It's a look.

17:16.299 --> 17:18.001
Would you quit panicking?

17:18.001 --> 17:19.569
I'm sure we did fine.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.504
Why else would they
have asked us to stay?

17:21.504 --> 17:22.872
Hello.

17:22.872 --> 17:26.576
Isn't that skirt a little
drafty for January?

17:26.576 --> 17:29.979
The director seemed
to warm right up to it.

17:29.979 --> 17:31.548
Congratulations
Miss Spellman.

17:31.548 --> 17:32.715
You've got the part.

17:32.715 --> 17:34.551
Really? Oh,
that's fantastic.

17:34.551 --> 17:37.253
Hope you saved the
receipt for that skirt.

17:37.253 --> 17:39.355
Oh, obviously, they
decided to go

17:39.355 --> 17:41.291
for the frumpy
housewife look.

17:41.291 --> 17:42.959
You'll be perfect.

17:42.959 --> 17:44.027
I've got some
good news

17:44.027 --> 17:45.795
for you, too, Mrs. Scott.

17:45.795 --> 17:48.198
The role of the cat
goes to Mandy.

17:48.198 --> 17:51.434
( <i>muffled protest</i> )

17:51.434 --> 17:53.570
Well, it's a good thing
the party broke up.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.405
We're all out of
crackers and cheese.

17:55.405 --> 17:57.674
Sabrina, that's why
the party broke up.

17:57.674 --> 18:00.043
It's the only reason
those people came.

18:00.043 --> 18:01.244
Let's face it.

18:01.244 --> 18:03.947
I'm never going
to sell another photograph.

18:03.947 --> 18:05.348
I'm a one-trick pony.

18:05.348 --> 18:07.517
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you're not
cut out for this.

18:07.517 --> 18:08.685
Is that
what you really think?

18:08.685 --> 18:09.686
Of course not.

18:09.686 --> 18:11.888
But it doesn't
matter what I think.

18:11.888 --> 18:14.958
Do you like this picture?

18:14.958 --> 18:16.593
Well, yeah, I do

18:16.593 --> 18:17.861
but other people
don't seem to...

18:17.861 --> 18:18.995
Oh, forget about
other people.

18:18.995 --> 18:20.163
This isn't about
other people.

18:20.163 --> 18:22.198
This is about you
believing in yourself.

18:22.198 --> 18:23.466
And if you measure
your talent

18:23.466 --> 18:25.401
based on other
people's approval

18:25.401 --> 18:27.203
your self-esteem is
going to go up and down

18:27.203 --> 18:28.972
faster than a jackrabbit
on a pogo stick.

18:28.972 --> 18:31.140
Why are you suddenly talking
like Jed Clampett?

18:31.140 --> 18:32.609
I'm trying to
make a point.

18:32.609 --> 18:34.477
You told me you
loved photography.

18:34.477 --> 18:35.478
Yeah, I <i>do.</i>

18:35.478 --> 18:37.547
Well, then you got
to stick with it.

18:37.547 --> 18:39.015
Persistence
is everything.

18:39.015 --> 18:40.316
You're never going
to get better

18:40.316 --> 18:41.784
unless you fail
every now and then.

18:41.784 --> 18:43.119
Someone forgot to invite me

18:43.119 --> 18:44.554
to their gallery show.

18:44.554 --> 18:46.089
So when does
the party start?

18:46.089 --> 18:47.423
It's over.

18:47.423 --> 18:49.659
And you'll be happy to know
I didn't sell a thing.

18:49.659 --> 18:52.795
Josh, I didn't come here because
I wanted to see you fail.

18:52.795 --> 18:55.431
Sure, you neglected
your responsibilities at work

18:55.431 --> 18:56.799
and treated me like dirt

18:56.799 --> 18:57.967
but I wasn't
going to miss

18:57.967 --> 18:59.636
your first exhibition.

18:59.636 --> 19:01.404
Now, where's that
free cheese?

19:01.404 --> 19:03.539
Hilda, look, I owe you
a big apology.

19:03.539 --> 19:05.909
My behavior at
the coffee shop was
totally out of line.

19:05.909 --> 19:08.544
It's okay. Sometimes
people get carried away

19:08.544 --> 19:10.313
and do things
without thinking

19:10.313 --> 19:11.814
about the repercussions.

19:11.814 --> 19:13.750
Isn't that right, Sabrina?

19:13.750 --> 19:15.018
Absolutely.

19:15.018 --> 19:17.787
Look, I don't know what kind
of photographer you are

19:17.787 --> 19:20.623
but when you pay attention
you're a heck of a manager.

19:20.623 --> 19:21.724
So what do you say?

19:21.724 --> 19:23.159
I'd love to.

19:23.159 --> 19:25.395
Great. Well, I'm going
to look around for a while

19:25.395 --> 19:26.596
and, uh, if you find
any of that cheese

19:26.596 --> 19:28.464
give me a holler.

19:28.464 --> 19:30.466
Hey, look, it's that guy
that wanted to buy

19:30.466 --> 19:34.037
the picture
at the coffeehouse.

19:34.037 --> 19:35.204
Hey, I know you.

19:35.204 --> 19:36.940
You're the guy
who couldn't afford

19:36.940 --> 19:38.508
"Dog on Credenza with Cat."

19:38.508 --> 19:40.944
Yes. Just because I
can't afford your work

19:40.944 --> 19:42.679
doesn't mean I
can't enjoy it.

19:42.679 --> 19:44.514
Aw, who says
you can't afford it?

19:44.514 --> 19:45.581
You did.

19:45.581 --> 19:47.517
That was before.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.152
Here you go.

19:49.152 --> 19:51.421
It's yours,
on the house.

19:51.421 --> 19:53.389
I couldn't just
take it for free.

19:53.389 --> 19:54.657
Well, sure you can.

19:54.657 --> 19:55.892
Between you and me

19:55.892 --> 19:57.527
I've still got
a little work to do

19:57.527 --> 19:58.962
on my aesthetic vision.

19:58.962 --> 20:01.464
At least let me give you
the $50 I offered you before.

20:01.464 --> 20:04.200
Then I wouldn't feel so guilty
about the names I called you

20:04.200 --> 20:08.738
after I was laughed out
of the coffeehouse.

20:08.738 --> 20:10.506
Wow, so you got
your job back

20:10.506 --> 20:11.841
and sold a picture?

20:11.841 --> 20:13.343
Must be your lucky day.

20:13.343 --> 20:14.510
Yes, it is.

20:14.510 --> 20:15.712
Thanks, Sabrina.

20:15.712 --> 20:17.714
If it weren't for you,
I never would have had

20:17.714 --> 20:18.815
the courage to try this.

20:18.815 --> 20:20.683
Well, it's the least
I could do.

20:20.683 --> 20:21.718
Trust me on that.

20:21.718 --> 20:23.853
What do you say we
take this 50 bucks

20:23.853 --> 20:26.489
get crazy and blow it
on a brick of Velveeta?

20:26.489 --> 20:27.490
Keep your money.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.425
I saved us
a little private stash.

20:34.063 --> 20:35.465
Monsieur.

20:35.465 --> 20:37.367
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

20:37.367 --> 20:40.036
Oh... say cheese.

20:40.036 --> 20:41.237
Did I hear cheese?

20:49.278 --> 20:50.279
Oh! Hilda!

20:50.279 --> 20:52.015
The commercial's
coming on. Hurry.

20:52.015 --> 20:54.617
Oh, I can't believe
you're going to be
on television.

20:54.617 --> 20:55.952
I can't believe they hired

20:55.952 --> 20:58.688
that no-talent,
silver-tipped fur ball over me.

20:58.688 --> 20:59.789
That's show biz.

20:59.789 --> 21:02.091
You tried, you lost,
get over it.

21:02.091 --> 21:03.393
( <i>snarling</i> )

21:03.393 --> 21:05.795
Shh. Here comes
my big entrance.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.931
I've tried 40 different kinds
of cat foods

21:08.931 --> 21:12.101
and Fluffy has turned
her nose up at all of them.

21:12.101 --> 21:13.836
I sure hope she likes
Little Wussies.

21:13.836 --> 21:15.872
There's my leg.

21:15.872 --> 21:17.073
My arms, my arms.

21:17.073 --> 21:18.408
Where's your head?

21:18.408 --> 21:20.743
Little Wussies,
you're a lifesaver.

21:20.743 --> 21:21.844
ZELDA:
That's it?

21:21.844 --> 21:24.080
Three and a half hours
in hair and makeup

21:24.080 --> 21:25.882
and they don't even
show my face?

21:25.882 --> 21:27.116
That's show biz, babe.

21:27.116 --> 21:29.552
You tried, you lost,
get over it.

21:29.552 --> 21:30.887
( <i>snarling</i> )
