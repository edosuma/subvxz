<i>Joan of Arc is like,</i>

00:02.953 --> 00:04.364
<i>we are going to just</i>

00:04.454 --> 00:06.026
<i>freaking... Ugh.</i>

00:06.103 --> 00:07.868
<i>I hate it
when people say "freaking."</i>

00:07.945 --> 00:09.581
God, the Middle Ages.

00:09.658 --> 00:11.305
I'm glad
we're not in them.

00:11.382 --> 00:13.787
<i>They sort of are co-ruling
in this time.</i>

00:13.864 --> 00:15.490
<i>Temujin and Jamukha</i>

00:15.567 --> 00:17.082
<i>they're at odds.</i>

00:17.171 --> 00:19.192
Man, this must be so hard.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.089
<i>Mansa Musa
spends so much gold</i>

00:21.166 --> 00:23.951
<i>that it has caused inflation.
This is the richest man</i>

00:24.028 --> 00:25.305
<i>that has ever walked the Earth,</i>

00:25.382 --> 00:26.667
<i>and you've never heard of him.</i>

00:26.744 --> 00:29.367
It sucks, being the king,
sometimes.

Tonight we're drinking
old fashioneds.

00:46.871 --> 00:49.005
Do you ever do
the orange slices?

00:49.073 --> 00:50.111
No.

00:50.179 --> 00:51.942
- There's an onion. Would that be...
- No,

00:52.010 --> 00:53.366
- no you don't want to do that.
- Okay.

00:53.434 --> 00:54.499
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:54.576 --> 00:55.671
To Joan.

00:55.739 --> 00:56.856
To Joan.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.953
You don't like it.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.226
No.

01:05.381 --> 01:06.382
Oh, sorry.

01:06.459 --> 01:07.481
Okay.

01:07.558 --> 01:09.716
Hello.
I'm Hillary Anne Matthews,

01:09.793 --> 01:13.839
and today, we're going
to talk about Joan of Arc.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.788
<i>Our story begins in France,</i>

01:16.865 --> 01:19.569
<i>in... the year 1412.</i>

01:19.646 --> 01:22.884
<i>The Hundred Years' War
is raging in Europe</i>

01:22.961 --> 01:24.573
<i>in between
France and England.</i>

01:24.650 --> 01:27.634
<i>So Joan of Arc
was a peasant girl.</i>

01:27.711 --> 01:30.389
<i>She's 13 years old,
she's in a field,</i>

01:30.466 --> 01:33.472
<i>but then, all of a sudden,
she hears voices.</i>

01:33.569 --> 01:35.342
<i>We have a mission for you.</i>

01:35.419 --> 01:36.606
<i>And she was like...</i>

01:36.683 --> 01:37.716
<i>What?</i>

01:37.784 --> 01:39.128
<i>Who even are you guys?</i>

01:39.205 --> 01:41.413
<i>And they were like,
I'm St. Michael,</i>

01:41.490 --> 01:42.946
<i>I'm St. Margaret,</i>

01:43.023 --> 01:44.561
<i>and I'm St. Catherine,</i>

01:44.638 --> 01:45.690
<i>and they're like,</i>

01:45.767 --> 01:48.470
<i>all we want
is for you to go to church</i>

01:48.547 --> 01:50.884
<i>and just, like,
be cool and chill and obedient.</i>

01:50.961 --> 01:52.086
<i>She's like, that's it?</i>

01:52.163 --> 01:54.083
<i>And they're like,
yeah, that's it.</i>

01:54.160 --> 01:57.345
<i>The King of France
was King Charles VI.</i>

01:57.422 --> 02:00.187
<i>People around him get him
to sign a peace treaty</i>

02:00.264 --> 02:02.329
<i>that will end
the Hundred Years' War.</i>

02:02.406 --> 02:05.321
<i>He... has a son,
also named Charles...</i>

02:05.398 --> 02:06.596
<i>Charles of Valois...</i>

02:06.673 --> 02:09.066
<i>also called "the Dauphin."</i>

02:09.198 --> 02:11.706
<i>So when his father</i>

02:11.809 --> 02:14.003
<i>signed this peace treaty,</i>

02:14.125 --> 02:16.891
<i>it was disinheriting him
from the throne.</i>

02:17.701 --> 02:18.939
Gosh darn it!

02:19.016 --> 02:20.381
It's just one little drop.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.261
It's been happening this whole time.

02:22.766 --> 02:27.621
Okay. So, Joan is now a
16-year-old girl in a 16...

02:29.144 --> 02:31.269
In a 16-year-old world

02:31.507 --> 02:34.254
<i>and these voices, they're like,</i>

02:34.331 --> 02:36.964
<i>hey, girl, you need to
lead France to victory</i>

02:37.041 --> 02:41.390
<i>and get
Charles Valois crowned</i>

02:41.467 --> 02:44.051
<i>as the rightful King of France,</i>

02:44.128 --> 02:46.081
<i>and she was like, ha!</i>

02:46.265 --> 02:48.331
<i>You guys!</i>

02:48.592 --> 02:51.924
<i>That's not what you told me
the first time, you guys.</i>

02:52.013 --> 02:54.483
<i>They're like, you need to
go to this lord gentleman</i>

02:54.560 --> 02:55.780
<i>named Baudricourt.</i>

02:55.857 --> 02:58.207
<i>He's gonna help you
get Charles crowned.</i>

02:58.284 --> 03:00.084
<i>Then she runs away from home</i>

03:00.161 --> 03:02.217
<i>to Lord Baudricourt.</i>

03:02.361 --> 03:06.231
<i>She arrives, and Joan's like,
hello, I am Joan,</i>

03:06.308 --> 03:08.188
<i>and I am here because</i>

03:08.265 --> 03:10.067
<i>saints talked to me
in my head</i>

03:10.144 --> 03:13.626
<i>and it is God's will
to have Charles of Valois</i>

03:13.703 --> 03:16.011
<i>crowned the rightful King of France.</i>

03:16.187 --> 03:18.657
<i>And Lord Baudricourt
is straight-up like,</i>

03:18.734 --> 03:21.703
<i>Get this crazy girl</i>

03:21.780 --> 03:23.428
<i>back to her home,</i>

03:23.505 --> 03:25.261
<i>but like then,
what happens is that</i>

03:25.338 --> 03:27.145
<i>she gets, kind of like,
a following.</i>

03:27.222 --> 03:29.325
<i>People have heard
about Joan of Arc,</i>

03:29.402 --> 03:30.802
<i>and they are on board.</i>

03:30.879 --> 03:33.160
<i>Lord Baudricourt is like,</i>

03:33.279 --> 03:36.447
<i>okay, well, actually,
we can work with this,</i>

03:36.524 --> 03:37.952
<i>and Joan's like,</i>

03:38.029 --> 03:39.994
<i>cut off my hair and
dress me in men's clothes</i>

03:40.071 --> 03:42.954
<i>so I don't get raped,
and he's like, okay.</i>

03:43.031 --> 03:44.782
<i>Because
it was really dangerous</i>

03:44.859 --> 03:45.923
<i>'cause she's a woman.</i>

03:45.991 --> 03:48.223
Ugh. God,
the Middle Ages.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.123
I'm glad we're not in them.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.264
Amen.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.042
Too harsh to women,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.730
and the breath was bad.

03:56.753 --> 04:00.403
<i>So they arrive at Chinon, and
Charles of Valois is like,</i>

04:00.480 --> 04:02.858
<i>um, wait,
who's here?</i>

04:02.935 --> 04:04.804
<i>And they're like,
a 16-year-old girl</i>

04:04.881 --> 04:06.855
<i>who hears the voices of saints,</i>

04:06.932 --> 04:09.119
<i>and he's like, okay,
you know what?</i>

04:09.196 --> 04:10.622
<i>Here's what I'm gonna do.</i>

04:10.699 --> 04:13.608
<i>I'm gonna put on
this big goofy mustache</i>

04:13.685 --> 04:15.403
<i>and this big floppy hat</i>

04:15.480 --> 04:17.207
<i>and I'm gonna trick her</i>

04:17.284 --> 04:19.137
<i>and I'm gonna see
if she knows what's up.</i>

04:19.214 --> 04:20.708
<i>And so, he's just, like,</i>

04:20.785 --> 04:22.722
<i>I'm just a courtier,</i>

04:22.810 --> 04:25.332
<i>I'm just a regular old courtier,</i>

04:25.409 --> 04:27.394
<i>and she walks in,
and she's like...</i>

04:28.101 --> 04:29.709
<i>You're Charles of Valois.</i>

04:29.786 --> 04:31.578
<i>You are my rightful king.</i>

04:31.660 --> 04:33.253
<i>He's like, wow.</i>

04:35.666 --> 04:36.967
Slow clap.

04:37.379 --> 04:38.624
He slow claps her.

04:38.701 --> 04:40.694
Can you believe that
he slow claps her?

04:40.771 --> 04:41.801
The first slow clap.

04:41.878 --> 04:43.669
Yeah,
it was the first slow clap.

04:43.746 --> 04:45.927
<i>And so, he's like, great!</i>

04:46.004 --> 04:48.117
<i>Because
we want the same thing,</i>

04:48.194 --> 04:50.261
<i>which is for me
to be King of France.</i>

04:50.428 --> 04:52.229
<i>So Joan was like,</i>

04:52.306 --> 04:55.061
<i>okay, dude,
give me an army.</i>

04:55.138 --> 04:56.678
<i>I want that army.</i>

04:56.755 --> 04:57.911
<i>Ooh, give me that army!</i>

04:57.988 --> 05:00.574
<i>And he's like,
okay, guess what?</i>

05:00.708 --> 05:02.470
<i>Army bestowed.</i>

05:03.566 --> 05:07.011
<i>She sets out
with this army to Orleans.</i>

05:07.154 --> 05:08.577
<i>So they get there</i>

05:08.654 --> 05:10.864
<i>and they were like,
okay, here's what's up.</i>

05:10.941 --> 05:12.048
<i>We have to strategize.</i>

05:12.125 --> 05:13.939
<i>We have to think about
this logically.</i>

05:14.016 --> 05:15.804
<i>We have to make plans,
and Joan was like,</i>

05:15.881 --> 05:17.628
<i>Guess the *** what?</i>

05:17.744 --> 05:20.039
<i>No!</i>

05:20.315 --> 05:23.255
<i>We got to just go for it,
you guys!</i>

05:23.332 --> 05:26.561
<i>Only 'cause
God wants us to do it.</i>

05:26.638 --> 05:28.413
<i>And they're like,
oh, my gosh, God?</i>

05:28.490 --> 05:29.629
<i>Yeah, he's the tops.</i>

05:29.706 --> 05:31.153
<i>We are going to just</i>

05:31.230 --> 05:32.694
<i>freaking... Ugh.</i>

05:32.771 --> 05:34.891
<i>I hate it
when people say "freaking."</i>

05:34.968 --> 05:36.213
<i>Then say it differently.</i>

05:36.290 --> 05:37.807
So then they just *** ing

05:37.884 --> 05:39.016
go for it

05:39.099 --> 05:41.593
and they are like,
attacking and attacking,

05:41.670 --> 05:43.245
<i>and attacking the English,</i>

05:43.322 --> 05:45.189
<i>and Joan is in the thick of it,</i>

05:45.266 --> 05:47.785
<i>and she is not shying away,</i>

05:47.862 --> 05:49.116
<i>and then thwup!</i>

05:49.193 --> 05:52.860
<i>She gets hit in the
shoulder with an arrow.</i>

05:52.937 --> 05:56.655
<i>But here's what's amazing,
the English surrender,</i>

05:56.732 --> 05:58.322
<i>and they're like, fine!</i>

05:58.399 --> 05:59.906
<i>White handkerchief.</i>

05:59.983 --> 06:01.425
<i>White handkerchief.</i>

06:01.502 --> 06:03.637
<i>You do "handkercheef"
instead of "handkerchif."</i>

06:03.714 --> 06:04.731
<i>Yes.</i>

06:04.808 --> 06:06.257
<i>- Hm.
- Handkercheef. Handkerchief.</i>

06:06.334 --> 06:07.342
Yeah, I do.

06:07.419 --> 06:09.573
- Okay.
- <i>And everyone's like, we did it!</i>

06:09.650 --> 06:11.145
<i>And we did it
because Joan of Arc</i>

06:11.222 --> 06:13.081
<i>led us to this point!</i>

06:14.931 --> 06:16.749
<i>Charles of Valois, the Dauphin,</i>

06:16.826 --> 06:18.863
<i>is crowned King of France</i>

06:18.940 --> 06:21.269
<i>and everyone's like, yay.</i>

06:24.870 --> 06:28.055
Then, Charles of Valois is like,

06:28.132 --> 06:30.597
<i>now I want you to go to
Paris and take Paris.</i>

06:30.689 --> 06:32.116
<i>She's like, cool, I'll do it!</i>

06:32.193 --> 06:33.574
So Joan goes to Paris

06:33.651 --> 06:36.527
<i>and she shoots a bunch of arrows</i>

06:36.731 --> 06:39.324
<i>- Waa!
- Waa!</i>

06:39.533 --> 06:41.727
<i>So in the midst of this battle,</i>

06:41.804 --> 06:44.564
<i>Joan is captured,
and they're like,</i>

06:44.685 --> 06:45.819
<i>we got you!</i>

06:45.896 --> 06:47.729
<i>Ooh, did we ever get you!</i>

06:47.806 --> 06:49.785
<i>You are marins wen's clo...</i>

06:49.912 --> 06:54.243
<i>You are wearing men's
clothes, and now, girlfriend,</i>

06:54.320 --> 06:57.298
<i>that means you got to
be burned at the stake,</i>

06:57.375 --> 06:58.667
<i>and she's like,</i>

06:59.903 --> 07:01.362
<i>***</i>

07:01.632 --> 07:07.163
<i>Joan of Arc, 19 years old,
is put onto a wooden stake,</i>

07:07.240 --> 07:09.753
and then, um,
they light it on fire.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.195
Phew!

07:11.397 --> 07:13.644
<i>And then she starts
calling out for her saints,</i>

07:13.721 --> 07:15.333
<i>and she's like, St. Michael,</i>

07:15.410 --> 07:18.121
<i>the big kahuna of saints,
St. Michael!</i>

07:18.329 --> 07:20.233
<i>St. Margaret!</i>

07:20.310 --> 07:21.620
<i>Okay, St. Catherine!</i>

07:21.697 --> 07:23.055
<i>St. Catherine, St. Margaret,</i>

07:23.123 --> 07:24.781
<i>St. Catherine, 
St. Michael, St. Margaret,</i>

07:24.849 --> 07:25.930
<i>St. Catherine!</i>

07:26.704 --> 07:29.902
<i>It's like, cricket, cricket, cricket,</i>

07:29.999 --> 07:32.934
<i>and everybody's just watching
this 19-year-old woman</i>

07:33.011 --> 07:36.072
<i>just get burnt alive at the stake.</i>

07:36.213 --> 07:38.575
<i>So then Joan... she dies.</i>

07:40.561 --> 07:42.367
The end.

07:43.193 --> 07:46.917
Is it redundant to believe
in your own beliefs?

07:47.042 --> 07:49.507
I don't care,
and neither did Joan.

07:49.584 --> 07:51.602
Here's the thing
about 17-year-olds.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.969
At that time,

07:53.046 --> 07:55.011
standing in a field, blinking.

07:55.765 --> 07:56.991
At this time,

07:57.068 --> 07:58.972
<i>looking at Instagram, blinking.</i>

07:59.353 --> 08:00.917
Joan of Arc,

08:01.479 --> 08:03.769
<i>leading an army!</i>

08:05.240 --> 08:08.271
I'm not saying you
need to aspire to more,

08:08.348 --> 08:10.699
but, like, maybe aspire to more.

08:10.879 --> 08:12.936
Like, maybe lead an army or two

08:13.013 --> 08:14.316
or one or two.

08:20.504 --> 08:21.964
How do you feel you would be

08:22.041 --> 08:23.077
in the Middle Ages?

08:23.154 --> 08:24.803
I would be pretty bad,
I think.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.236
I don't think
I could survive.

08:26.313 --> 08:28.062
I think I have the mind
to survive,

08:28.139 --> 08:30.161
but I don't think
Ihave the physical body

08:30.238 --> 08:31.784
to survive the Middle Ages.

08:31.861 --> 08:32.950
- Yeah.
- Like, I don't think

08:33.027 --> 08:34.606
I could ride a horse

08:34.683 --> 08:38.530
or shoot an arrow,
or even pick up a heavy sword.

08:38.607 --> 08:39.746
Probably that'd be problem.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.075
But that's how to survive.

08:41.152 --> 08:42.466
- That's everything.
- So don't you think, like,

08:42.534 --> 08:44.058
- you would force yourself.
- Maybe I'd figure it out.

08:44.135 --> 08:45.614
You would just have to do it.

08:45.722 --> 08:46.748
Well...

08:46.816 --> 08:47.847
I don't know, man.

08:47.924 --> 08:50.217
I really... I get a lot of delivery.

08:50.294 --> 08:51.874
You do a lot of Postmates?

08:51.951 --> 08:53.722
I do a lot of Postmates.

08:54.489 --> 08:57.605
Hi, I'm Shaun Diston,
and today,

08:57.704 --> 09:00.542
we're gonna be talking about Temujin.

09:00.788 --> 09:02.710
You might not know
that name right now,

09:02.787 --> 09:05.340
but, ooh, listen... listen
forward, and you will

09:05.417 --> 09:07.408
get to know it a little bit later.

09:07.521 --> 09:08.789
Mm.

09:08.974 --> 09:10.923
<i>So our story begins with</i>

09:11.000 --> 09:13.741
<i>a young child
whose name is Temujin.</i>

09:13.818 --> 09:16.184
<i>He was born
in a mid-level clan</i>

09:16.261 --> 09:17.850
<i>in the Mongol tribe,</i>

09:17.959 --> 09:20.791
<i>and very early
on in Temujin's life,</i>

09:20.868 --> 09:22.688
<i>he meets this kid
named Jamukha</i>

09:22.765 --> 09:23.917
<i>who he grew up with</i>

09:23.994 --> 09:26.298
<i>and is like,
we live in the same place</i>

09:26.375 --> 09:28.249
<i>we're
at the same station in life.</i>

09:28.326 --> 09:30.459
<i>Let's be blood brothers.</i>

09:30.651 --> 09:34.015
<i>So they become blood
brothers and eventually</i>

09:34.092 --> 09:35.517
<i>Temujin and Jamukha</i>

09:35.594 --> 09:37.679
<i>both become, like,
tribal leaders,</i>

09:37.756 --> 09:39.667
<i>and they sort of rise to power</i>

09:39.744 --> 09:43.053
<i>from those ashes of poverty
that they came out of before,</i>

09:43.142 --> 09:44.807
and at age 16,

09:44.884 --> 09:47.353
Temujin marries Borte,

09:47.430 --> 09:49.790
<i>who he was betrothed
to by his father,</i>

09:49.867 --> 09:51.488
<i>but very quickly after that,</i>

09:51.565 --> 09:53.905
<i>she gets kidnapped
by the Merkit tribe.</i>

09:53.982 --> 09:56.628
<i>So Temujin asks Jamukha for help,</i>

09:56.705 --> 09:58.868
<i>and he says, hey, I need you</i>

09:58.945 --> 10:01.931
<i>because the Merkit
have kidnapped my wife,</i>

10:02.008 --> 10:04.053
<i>and Jamukha's like, yeah,
we're blood brothers,</i>

10:04.130 --> 10:06.795
<i>and I'm going to help you
get your wife.</i>

10:08.848 --> 10:10.409
<i>It takes, like, months and months...</i>

10:10.486 --> 10:11.569
<i>almost a year...</i>

10:11.646 --> 10:14.185
<i>and so Temujin gets his wife back,</i>

10:14.262 --> 10:15.913
<i>and they're like, here's a belt.</i>

10:15.990 --> 10:18.335
<i>We're brothers.
It's like a friendship belt,</i>

10:18.412 --> 10:20.033
<i>and this will last forever.</i>

10:20.110 --> 10:23.406
<i>And, you know,
they sort of are co-ruling</i>

10:23.483 --> 10:24.935
<i>in this time.</i>

10:25.062 --> 10:27.046
One of the things that
made Temujin different

10:27.123 --> 10:28.140
from Ongol...

10:28.217 --> 10:29.259
Oof.

10:29.336 --> 10:30.671
Sorry, hold on.

10:31.684 --> 10:33.931
<i>So one of the things that
made Temujin different</i>

10:34.008 --> 10:35.443
<i>from other Mongol leaders</i>

10:35.520 --> 10:38.126
<i>is he appointed people,
uh, through merit,</i>

10:38.203 --> 10:40.071
<i>and not just through family bonds,</i>

10:40.148 --> 10:42.652
<i>and that started to make
his army super-efficient,</i>

10:42.729 --> 10:45.192
<i>and it sort of changed
the way Mongols ruled,</i>

10:45.269 --> 10:47.852
<i>and that started to
conflict with Jamukha.</i>

10:47.929 --> 10:50.256
<i>So Temujin and Jamukha at are a...</i>

10:50.710 --> 10:52.444
at are at odds since then.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.563
They're at odds.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.866
They're at odds.

10:54.943 --> 10:59.295
<i>Okay, so they are on this
path to this huge civil war.</i>

10:59.402 --> 11:03.170
<i>Temujin amasses a force
of over 20,000 men.</i>

11:03.254 --> 11:05.778
<i>They call it "The Battle
of the 13 Sides."</i>

11:05.855 --> 11:08.560
<i>Temujin's forces and
Jamukha's forces clash</i>

11:09.061 --> 11:10.701
<i>and they fight</i>

11:11.340 --> 11:13.881
<i>and Temujin is victorious,</i>

11:14.525 --> 11:16.731
<i>but Jamukha escapes.</i>

11:16.823 --> 11:18.829
<i>He's wandering through the forest</i>

11:18.906 --> 11:22.362
<i>and some of his own men find him</i>

11:22.439 --> 11:25.503
<i>and they turn him over to Temujin,</i>

11:25.580 --> 11:29.270
<i>and Temujin, in finding out
that his men betrayed him,</i>

11:29.419 --> 11:31.666
<i>he's like, I'm a man of honor,</i>

11:31.743 --> 11:34.901
<i>so you guys are gonna die,</i>

11:35.013 --> 11:37.682
<i>and he kills the guys</i>

11:37.759 --> 11:39.350
<i>who betray Jamukha</i>

11:39.427 --> 11:42.166
<i>and him and Jamukha
sort of have this moment</i>

11:42.243 --> 11:44.575
<i>where he's captured
and Jamukha's like,</i>

11:44.655 --> 11:47.361
<i>well, Temujin,
you've won the war.</i>

11:47.438 --> 11:48.595
<i>You've captured me.</i>

11:48.672 --> 11:49.732
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

11:49.809 --> 11:51.216
<i>And he says to Jamukha,</i>

11:51.293 --> 11:52.680
<i>or Jamukay,</i>

11:52.757 --> 11:54.254
<i>or John Binet.</i>

11:55.775 --> 11:57.153
You'll figure it out.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.731
<i>He says, hey, we were
bro... blood brothers.</i>

12:01.837 --> 12:03.694
<i>We were... we were blood brothers,</i>

12:03.771 --> 12:06.425
<i>and... we've had this war,</i>

12:06.502 --> 12:09.692
<i>but I want to renew
our blood bro'ur... ou...</i>

12:09.769 --> 12:11.093
Phew.

12:11.906 --> 12:14.004
Man, this must be so hard.

12:14.663 --> 12:15.809
So he says,

12:15.886 --> 12:19.808
<i>I want to renew
our blood brother pact,</i>

12:19.976 --> 12:22.029
<i>and Jamukha says no,</i>

12:22.106 --> 12:26.075
<i>as there is only room
for one sun in the sky,</i>

12:26.152 --> 12:30.018
<i>there is only room for one Mongol ruler,</i>

12:30.095 --> 12:33.948
<i>and Jamukha says, I will die,</i>

12:34.118 --> 12:36.056
<i>and requests an honorable death.</i>

12:36.133 --> 12:37.498
<i>An honorable death here</i>

12:37.575 --> 12:39.910
<i>means
that no blood would be spilled.</i>

12:39.987 --> 12:42.210
<i>So Temujin ordered his men,</i>

12:42.287 --> 12:46.531
<i>hey, this is my blood brother,
but he's still my guy.</i>

12:46.608 --> 12:48.075
<i>I want you to break his back.</i>

12:48.152 --> 12:50.750
<i>And it was bittersweet,</i>

12:50.827 --> 12:54.393
<i>because he had just
defeated the final rival,</i>

12:54.470 --> 12:56.184
<i>but it was his blood brother,</i>

12:56.261 --> 12:58.381
<i>who he considered
his real brother,</i>

12:58.458 --> 13:01.919
<i>and Temujin buries Jamukha
with that golden belt,</i>

13:01.996 --> 13:03.806
<i>in a show of, like,</i>

13:03.883 --> 13:06.949
<i>yes, you were a...
a huge, like, dick,</i>

13:07.026 --> 13:10.050
<i>but you were still
my blood brother.</i>

13:10.707 --> 13:13.286
Shortly after that,
Temujin calls something

13:13.363 --> 13:15.469
called a... a <i>kurultai</i>, which is, like,

13:15.546 --> 13:17.824
<i>the way they vote on who's
going to be the leader.</i>

13:17.901 --> 13:21.474
<i>Temujin is greeted with
thousands of followers.</i>

13:21.551 --> 13:23.567
They all decided to vote him

13:23.644 --> 13:26.011
<i>as Chenghis Khan.</i>

13:26.200 --> 13:27.225
<i>"Chenghis."</i>

13:27.302 --> 13:28.451
<i>Chenghis Khan.</i>

13:28.528 --> 13:29.835
We call it Genghis Khan,

13:29.912 --> 13:31.774
I think, just 'cause
we're, like, whatever.

13:31.851 --> 13:33.415
We want to pronounce it
however we want.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.651
<i>And it was kind of like
a "Lion King" moment,</i>

13:35.728 --> 13:37.613
<i>where it was like,
thousands of people</i>

13:37.690 --> 13:40.788
<i>are watching this person
ascend into the sunlight.</i>

13:40.865 --> 13:43.874
<i>And that is when
he cemented himself</i>

13:43.951 --> 13:47.362
<i>as the universal leader
of the Mongols.</i>

13:47.597 --> 13:48.886
<i>This is the origin story</i>

13:48.963 --> 13:51.761
<i>of one of the most powerful
leaders in history,</i>

13:51.958 --> 13:53.973
<i>and the entire story started</i>

13:54.050 --> 13:56.401
<i>when he killed his blood brother.</i>

13:56.625 --> 13:58.770
<i>Chenghis Khan went on to conquer</i>

13:58.847 --> 14:01.716
<i>the largest land empire in history</i>

14:01.793 --> 14:03.472
<i>so it's pretty crazy.</i>

14:03.700 --> 14:06.175
<i>He murdered millions of people,</i>

14:06.779 --> 14:09.136
<i>and it was just like, I
guess I'm the ruler now.</i>

14:09.213 --> 14:10.381
<i>Yeah, what's it worth?</i>

14:10.458 --> 14:11.740
<i>What... what is it worth?</i>

14:11.817 --> 14:14.234
<i>You got a lot of violence
in the back of that brain.</i>

14:14.311 --> 14:16.127
<i>All I'm thinking about
is murder.</i>

14:16.204 --> 14:17.784
<i>It's pretty crazy.</i>

14:18.762 --> 14:19.796
Hey, you're watching

14:19.873 --> 14:21.574
"Drunk History"
on Comedy Central.

14:21.651 --> 14:23.065
I'm too drunk.

14:29.253 --> 14:31.214
So I'm making
a drink called dawa.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.847
It's Swahili for "medicine."

14:32.924 --> 14:34.233
It's a little sweet.

14:34.765 --> 14:36.891
So we got a little
honey, a little vodka,

14:36.968 --> 14:38.174
a little lime juice.

14:38.251 --> 14:39.757
Cheers to the Middle Ages,

14:39.834 --> 14:42.203
and thank God we don't have
to live through that shit.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.326
Yeah.

14:43.412 --> 14:45.359
Times are tough, but
not Middle Age tough.

14:45.436 --> 14:47.039
Uh-uh.
Not Middle Ages tough.

14:47.116 --> 14:48.428
Let me get a drink real quick.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.519
Okay.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.547
Hello.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.740
I'm Daryl Johnson,

14:53.817 --> 14:55.787
and today you're going
to learn about Mansa Musa,

14:55.864 --> 14:58.747
the richest person to
have ever walked the Earth.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.534
A black man.

15:02.137 --> 15:03.212
Ding.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.192
<i>So our story
begins in Western Africa.</i>

15:06.336 --> 15:08.966
<i>Mansa Musa inherits the
whole Malian Empire,</i>

15:09.043 --> 15:11.826
<i>and he's like,
well damn, I'm a boss.</i>

15:11.903 --> 15:13.913
I don't know if they knew
what bosses were back then,

15:13.981 --> 15:16.379
but I would assume
he knew what a boss was.

15:17.809 --> 15:20.006
This guy's estimated
net worth,

15:20.083 --> 15:23.575
580 billion dollars.

15:23.652 --> 15:25.364
♪ DaBoss

15:25.551 --> 15:27.622
<i>So Mansa was like,
look,</i>

15:27.699 --> 15:29.165
<i>I have all this wealth,</i>

15:29.242 --> 15:31.082
<i>but what
I really want to do</i>

15:31.159 --> 15:33.372
<i>I want
to make a pilgrimage to Mecca,</i>

15:33.510 --> 15:37.862
<i>'cause that is the highest
level of my religion.</i>

15:37.939 --> 15:39.714
<i>Uh, so his advisor's like,</i>

15:39.791 --> 15:42.103
<i>oh, yeah, great,
we'll get it ready,</i>

15:42.180 --> 15:43.827
<i>and he was like,
wait, hold up.</i>

15:43.904 --> 15:45.939
<i>I don't want you to think
that this is a regular,</i>

15:46.016 --> 15:48.206
<i>basic pilgrimage to Mecca.</i>

15:48.288 --> 15:49.464
<i>We on that new-new,</i>

15:49.541 --> 15:50.826
<i>and I gotta have, like,</i>

15:50.903 --> 15:52.453
<i>60,000 people,</i>

15:52.530 --> 15:54.051
<i>and I want 80 camels</i>

15:54.128 --> 15:57.340
<i>and every camel to have
200 pounds of gold on it.</i>

15:57.959 --> 16:00.226
<i>And so, in 1324,</i>

16:00.303 --> 16:03.658
<i>Mansa Musa embarks
on his pilgrimage to Mecca.</i>

16:03.735 --> 16:05.576
<i>Mansa Musa and his caravan,</i>

16:05.653 --> 16:08.793
<i>The Mansa Musa
and the Mussolinis...</i>

16:08.870 --> 16:09.833
No.

16:10.693 --> 16:12.093
I'm down with that.

16:12.354 --> 16:16.062
<i>Now, during his trek, Mansa
Musa arrives in Cairo.</i>

16:16.139 --> 16:18.633
<i>This man shows up
to a town that had</i>

16:18.710 --> 16:21.303
<i>a couple hundred thousand
people already there,</i>

16:21.380 --> 16:23.730
<i>and they see this man show
up with, like, 60,000 people,</i>

16:23.807 --> 16:26.515
<i>and they're like, hey,
man, welcome to Cairo.</i>

16:26.592 --> 16:28.649
<i>Uh, where...
where all y'all gonna stay?</i>

16:28.726 --> 16:31.720
<i>The only bed and breakfast
only got two bed.</i>

16:31.797 --> 16:33.566
<i>And Mansa Musa's like,
look, man,</i>

16:33.643 --> 16:35.859
<i>I got my own tents,
my own crew, we good.</i>

16:35.936 --> 16:37.943
<i>We're just gonna set up
on the outskirts of town,</i>

16:38.020 --> 16:39.500
<i>we're gonna do a little shopping,</i>

16:39.577 --> 16:41.001
<i>we're gonna hang,
and they was like,</i>

16:41.078 --> 16:42.086
<i>cool, come on in, Mansa.</i>

16:42.163 --> 16:43.434
<i>We got you.</i>

16:43.557 --> 16:45.349
<i>And at the time, uh,</i>

16:45.426 --> 16:47.297
the l... the... whoo.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.269
Okay. Let me just take
a breath for a second.

16:49.346 --> 16:50.304
You take a breath.

16:50.381 --> 16:51.849
How many drinks have I had?

16:51.926 --> 16:52.984
Huh, wait.

16:53.061 --> 16:56.476
<i>Okay, so he's summoned by
the sultan,</i>

16:56.553 --> 16:57.881
<i>al-Malik al-Nasir,</i>

16:57.958 --> 17:00.749
<i>and then Mansa Musa
shows up and he's like,</i>

17:00.826 --> 17:04.560
<i>hey, look, I'm gonna bow,
but I'm not bowing to you.</i>

17:04.637 --> 17:06.356
<i>I'm bowing to Allah.</i>

17:06.787 --> 17:08.606
<i>So the sultan was like, oh,</i>

17:08.742 --> 17:11.267
<i>I'm impressed by this man's piousness,</i>

17:11.344 --> 17:12.634
<i>and the sultan was like,</i>

17:12.711 --> 17:14.271
<i>you know what, Mansa?
Come on in.</i>

17:14.348 --> 17:15.666
<i>I got some gifts for you.</i>

17:15.743 --> 17:18.344
<i>Here.
I got these two golden sheep,</i>

17:18.421 --> 17:19.501
<i>and some geese,</i>

17:19.569 --> 17:23.393
<i>and here's 15 gold bars
and some gold coins,</i>

17:23.470 --> 17:25.964
<i>and Mansa Musa was like,
uh, yeah, that's cool, man.</i>

17:26.041 --> 17:28.027
<i>Hey.
Put that in the truck.</i>

17:28.113 --> 17:29.487
Oh. No, they had no trucks.

17:29.564 --> 17:30.618
Wait.

17:30.821 --> 17:33.051
<i>Hey, man, put that in the camel.</i>

17:34.616 --> 17:36.779
<i>So Mansa goes shopping,
uh, in the markets,</i>

17:36.856 --> 17:38.998
<i>and he spent so much gold in the town</i>

17:39.075 --> 17:40.740
<i>that it has caused inflation.</i>

17:40.817 --> 17:42.246
That's how rich he was.

17:42.323 --> 17:43.920
<i>I mean, this is crazy.</i>

17:43.997 --> 17:47.231
<i>The currency has been devalued.</i>

17:47.861 --> 17:51.707
So now, uh, word has gotten
back to Sultan al-Nasir.

17:51.784 --> 17:53.804
<i>He was like, damn that Mansa Musa!</i>

17:53.881 --> 17:56.411
<i>He has come here and ruined
the economy of my country.</i>

17:56.488 --> 17:57.631
<i>I'ma find that bastard.</i>

17:57.708 --> 18:00.383
<i>Where he at?
Somebody find Mansa Musa for me.</i>

18:00.460 --> 18:02.948
<i>I don't know why my
voice just got this high.</i>

18:04.688 --> 18:07.089
<i>But Mansa Musa has
already gone to Mecca,</i>

18:07.170 --> 18:09.149
<i>and he has prayed.</i>

18:09.226 --> 18:11.801
<i>He was like, ah, this is great.</i>

18:11.966 --> 18:13.851
<i>I have gone to Mecca</i>

18:13.928 --> 18:15.797
<i>with the largest caravan of people</i>

18:15.874 --> 18:17.273
<i>you will ever hear about.</i>

18:17.350 --> 18:19.173
<i>They're gonna be talking
about me forever.</i>

18:19.250 --> 18:20.344
Wrong.

18:20.437 --> 18:22.989
<i>Ain't nobody told us
about Mansa Musa.</i>

All hail King Daryl,

18:35.423 --> 18:36.757
da boss.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.235
On your way.

18:38.931 --> 18:40.829
Bring me grapes!

18:41.068 --> 18:43.767
It sucks, being the king,
sometimes.

18:44.528 --> 18:47.408
No one's worthy
of your presence.

18:49.037 --> 18:50.113
<i>Okay.</i>

18:50.190 --> 18:51.934
<i>So, on the way back,</i>

18:52.011 --> 18:54.383
<i>he stops in Cairo
again, only to find out</i>

18:54.460 --> 18:56.903
<i>that the sultan is angry,</i>

18:56.980 --> 18:58.379
<i>and Mansa Musa was like,</i>

18:58.456 --> 19:00.995
<i>look, I kinda thought
this might happen,</i>

19:01.072 --> 19:02.447
<i>but I have a solution.</i>

19:02.651 --> 19:05.626
<i>I'm going to buy back
all of your currency</i>

19:05.746 --> 19:08.587
<i>at a high interest rate
and stabilize your market.</i>

19:08.664 --> 19:11.040
<i>The sultan was like, man,</i>

19:11.117 --> 19:12.340
<i>that's actually a good plan.</i>

19:12.417 --> 19:14.023
<i>I think it'll work.</i>

19:15.587 --> 19:17.004
<i>So Mansa Musa</i>

19:17.081 --> 19:19.876
<i>has stabilized the economy of Cairo,</i>

19:20.089 --> 19:21.884
<i>and they hopped back on their camel</i>

19:21.965 --> 19:23.415
<i>and they head on home.</i>

19:23.492 --> 19:25.539
<i>They had a party,
they built schools,</i>

19:25.616 --> 19:26.885
<i>they built mosques.</i>

19:26.962 --> 19:28.890
<i>So now, rumors have spread</i>

19:28.967 --> 19:30.361
<i>all throughout the globe</i>

19:30.438 --> 19:32.049
<i>that there is this rich king</i>

19:32.126 --> 19:34.794
<i>who is making a 4,000-mile trek</i>

19:34.871 --> 19:36.661
<i>across the continent of Africa</i>

19:36.738 --> 19:38.782
<i>with 60,000 people</i>

19:38.859 --> 19:40.212
<i>and all this gold.</i>

19:40.431 --> 19:43.995
And that's how Mansa Musa
ended up on medieval maps.

19:44.072 --> 19:47.130
<i>There's a picture of a man
holding, like, a gold nugget,</i>

19:47.207 --> 19:48.833
<i>and that is Mansa Musa.</i>

19:48.910 --> 19:51.597
<i>This is the richest man that
has ever walked the Earth,</i>

19:51.674 --> 19:53.181
<i>and you've never heard of him.</i>

19:53.294 --> 19:55.718
I mean,

19:55.795 --> 19:58.680
for little brown kids
to hear stories about

19:58.757 --> 20:01.335
how we weren't just slaves.

20:01.412 --> 20:03.255
There were things
that we were great at,

20:03.332 --> 20:04.593
other things that we did

20:04.670 --> 20:06.385
that were
beneficial to the world.

20:06.462 --> 20:07.536
<i>Like, what?</i>

20:07.613 --> 20:08.601
<i>Africa?</i>
