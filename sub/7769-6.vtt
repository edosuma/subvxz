If you won't find me a commission,

I'll run away

I was able to be of service

00:16.759 --> 00:19.683
to Princess Marya Bolkonskaya.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.324
Well, it does seem like fate, doesn't it?

00:21.399 --> 00:22.446
(LAUGHS) Yes.

00:22.799 --> 00:23.880
It does.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.246
Just to confirm,
I have received a refusal

00:26.319 --> 00:27.480
from Countess Rostova.

00:27.639 --> 00:30.404
(SOBBING) Will you ask him
if he can forgive me?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.641
No one's as kind as you.

No, we retreat.

But I will spare her,

I will bring her justice

Is what because of you?

01:07:24.759 --> 01:07:29.287
That you won't tell Princess Bolkonskaya
that you love her and want to marry her.

01:07:30.039 --> 01:07:32.610
No, it's because our family are paupers.

about you, Sonya. I'd...

we could never be married.

01:07:57.519 --> 01:08:00.170
Oh, because I'm used to it.

I'm quite well, thank you,
in the circumstances.

01:08:44.839 --> 01:08:46.125
She's bearing up, thank you.

It was a great comfort to her.

As you see.

I've had to give up my commission
but that can't be helped.

01:09:11.839 --> 01:09:14.365
Well, you sacrificed yourself for
your family.

01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:18.048
That's so good of you and so sad...

01:09:18.118 --> 01:09:19.689
No, really, there's nothing to praise.

01:09:19.919 --> 01:09:23.560
I blame myself for my reckless conduct
in the past and I deserve to pay for it.

01:09:24.198 --> 01:09:27.328
But now my mother and sister
are to suffer for it, too.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:28.810
I'm not worthy of your kindness.

I thought
you'd let me sympathise with you.

And we seemed so close
when we were together in Voronezh.

But now something's gone wrong,
and I don't know why.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:45.609
There are a thousand reasons why.
Our family has lost everything.

01:09:46.038 --> 01:09:48.121
The war's over.
I have no profession.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.207

who has never wanted for anything,

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:52.850
now has to darn her own stockings.

01:09:52.919 --> 01:09:55.650
She's so ashamed, she can't even
go out and face her friends.

01:09:56.119 --> 01:09:58.486
My sister's life is over
before it's scarcely begun.

How can I ask for your help?

that I'm a fortune hunter.

It's a terrible thing
to have your children die before you.

Both my lovely children.

Oh, please don't embarrass me.

We were so glad to know
that you'd been saved.

we'd had in such a long time.

nothing about him surviving the battle?

So you were able
to see him before he died?

01:13:09.079 --> 01:13:11.889
Yeah, and he often spoke of you.

01:13:11.959 --> 01:13:14.246

He was just a peasant.

have grasped the secret of how to live.

He never worried.

and endured the bad things cheerfully.
