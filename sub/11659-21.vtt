(theme music playing)

00:53.967 --> 00:56.266
-Hi, Ma.
-What the hell you doing home?

00:56.333 --> 01:00.467
-You had a beauty parlor appointment.
-They finished with me early.

01:00.533 --> 01:02.467
On Christie Brinkley,
they can finish early.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.867
You need every minute.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.667
Now get back there.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.100
He's here, isn't he?

01:11.166 --> 01:13.500
-Who?
-Who? Rocco.

01:13.967 --> 01:14.667
Rocco?

01:14.734 --> 01:16.834
I'll refresh your memory.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.100
The man you met
in the police line-up?

01:19.166 --> 01:22.667
I was identifying the guy
who stole my purse.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.300
Rocco was there
on trumped-up charges.

01:24.367 --> 01:26.767
Ma, they caught him on a billboard,

01:26.834 --> 01:30.467
spray painting something obscene
on Spuds MacKenzie.

01:31.667 --> 01:35.400
The dog they use in those ads
is really a female.

01:35.467 --> 01:39.500
Rocco was just making Spuds
anatomically correct.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.066
The man is bad news.

01:44.133 --> 01:46.433
He has no job, he gambles.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.133
What kind of future does he have?

01:48.200 --> 01:52.266
Future, please. He's 85.
He's got so little time,

01:52.333 --> 01:55.600
he only uses the 10-items-or-less line
at the supermarket.

02:00.066 --> 02:03.800
-Look who came to say hello, Rocco.
-Hello, Dorothy.

02:03.867 --> 02:05.867
Always a pleasure. Nice seeing you.

02:05.934 --> 02:08.867
Cut the crap and put out the stogie,
Rocco.

02:09.767 --> 02:10.800
I like your style.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.934
Right suit, right haircut,
voice a little higher,

02:14.033 --> 02:16.600
you could pass as Frank Nitti.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.633
What the hell you talking about?

02:18.700 --> 02:20.934
A little higher, I think you've got it.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.200
You really knew Frank Nitti?

02:23.266 --> 02:26.467
Why, sure. Frank Nitti,
Dutch Schultz, Al Capone--

02:26.533 --> 02:28.900
You were in the mob?

02:28.967 --> 02:31.233
I ran Detroit.

02:31.967 --> 02:35.000
The marathon.
He ran the Detroit Marathon.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.767
Come on, we're in the middle of a hand.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.133
Uh, ahem.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.066
Four of a kind. Beat that.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.967
Straight flush. Pay me, honey. Heh.

02:49.066 --> 02:50.367
Ma, what are you doing?

02:50.433 --> 02:52.800
Losing at strip poker.

02:53.834 --> 02:56.633
That's it. Game's over.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.667
Who do you think you are,
Donald Trump?

02:59.734 --> 03:01.166
You don't own this casino.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.934
She's always telling me what to do.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.934
My daughter's the same way.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.967
Kids. Once they're over 50,
they think they know everything.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.033
I cannot believe my mother's hanging out
with that cheap hood.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.166
You mean Rocco?

03:19.233 --> 03:22.166
No, Rose. I mean Spiro Agnew.

03:23.266 --> 03:26.600
He gave her a highway contract
instead of an I.D. Bracelet.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.033
Of course I mean Rocco.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.934
-He's kind of cute.
-He is not cute.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.033
He is a bad influence.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.667
Ever since ma started seeing him,
she stays up all night.

03:38.734 --> 03:42.066
Yesterday she came home
with NyQuil on her breath

03:42.133 --> 03:45.266
and his surgical stockings in her pocket.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.533
Dorothy, can I ask you something?

03:53.600 --> 03:57.367
I don't know what it means.
I just don't like the possibilities.

03:57.433 --> 04:02.233
No, I wanted to ask you, do you think
Blanche has been picking on me?

04:02.300 --> 04:03.433
I haven't noticed.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.066
Hi, Blanche.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.734
Must you always be so cheerful,

04:08.800 --> 04:12.700
you empty-headed
Mary Poppins knockoff?

04:17.567 --> 04:20.100
Let me know if you notice anything.

04:22.767 --> 04:26.233
-Blanche, what's with you and Rose?
-I'll tell you what... this.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.600
-What is it?
-Rose's diary.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.266
What are you doing with it?

04:30.333 --> 04:35.200
It was on the dining room table.
The lock just popped right open,

04:35.266 --> 04:37.433
just like this.

04:39.967 --> 04:41.200
Listen to this.

04:41.266 --> 04:44.066
"Dear diary,
I don't know how much longer

04:44.133 --> 04:47.133
I can stand living with these two pigs."

04:51.033 --> 04:54.333
"Moving in with them seemed like
a good way to save money,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.200
but it's getting out of hand.

04:56.266 --> 04:58.967
If one isn't keeping me awake
by squealing,

04:59.033 --> 05:01.667
the other one
is belching in my face."

05:05.333 --> 05:08.000
You do that sometimes, Dorothy...

05:10.633 --> 05:13.233
after you've had a Denver omelet.

05:14.867 --> 05:18.300
You know, this is a real invasion
of Rose's privacy.

05:18.367 --> 05:21.066
And it's a Spanish omelet.

05:21.900 --> 05:25.667
-Doesn't it bother you?
-Not if I take Gelusil.

05:25.734 --> 05:29.900
Oh, the... the diary.
No. No, not at all,

05:29.967 --> 05:32.467
and I'm really shocked
that you read it.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.700
(scoffs) You're not interested
in the other things

05:35.767 --> 05:38.533
-she said about you?
-Not in the slightest.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.600
Uh-huh. Oh, fine. Suit yourself.

05:57.934 --> 06:00.300
(coughing)

06:09.533 --> 06:11.166
Use the knife.

06:14.667 --> 06:19.266
(tranquil music playing)

06:22.300 --> 06:24.266
Blanche, what are you doing?

06:24.333 --> 06:27.600
We agreed not to read
any more of Rose's diary.

06:27.667 --> 06:31.300
That was because we couldn't
pry the lock off again.

06:31.367 --> 06:35.000
Then I remembered we had theses pliers
in the tool drawer.

06:36.367 --> 06:39.767
Gangway!
Old people coming through.

06:43.066 --> 06:45.500
Ma, what is all this stuff here?

06:45.567 --> 06:47.867
It's not stuff, it's my life.

06:47.934 --> 06:51.066
Why bring your life into our living room?

06:51.133 --> 06:53.567
There have been some robberies
in Rocco's building.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.400
I'm storing his valuables.

06:55.467 --> 06:58.000
We don't have enough
space for this stuff.

06:58.066 --> 07:01.600
There's space in my room.
Come on, Rocco.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.667
When the two of you go in there,

07:03.734 --> 07:07.200
I want you to leave the door open.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.600
Yes, Mrs. Cleaver.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.233
Hi, girls.

07:16.166 --> 07:21.100
Gee, what's my diary doing here
next to a pair of pliers?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.734
Rose, whatever it is you're thinking,
it isn't true.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.800
Good, then George Bush
isn't married to his mother.

07:39.066 --> 07:41.633
Boy, that was easier than I thought.

07:42.633 --> 07:46.433
Hey, this lock has been tampered with.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.533
Wait a minute.
You two read my diary.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.867
(gasps) That's despicable!

07:51.934 --> 07:56.233
I will tell you what is despicable,
missy, the things you wrote.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.367
This is my book for my eyes.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.734
You have no right
to invade my privacy.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.433
You said some terrible things.
I thought we were friends.

08:05.500 --> 08:09.266
We used to be. We're not anymore.

08:11.433 --> 08:16.033
(gloomy music playing)

08:24.367 --> 08:26.433
-What's wrong?
-I have a problem.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.700
I'll say.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.400
You should never have stopped using
that depilatory.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.066
Ma, I'm up here.

08:41.967 --> 08:43.233
Oh.

08:43.300 --> 08:45.734
Rose isn't talking to me.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.200
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Now good night.

08:49.266 --> 08:52.166
Oh, hi, Dorothy.
Honey, can I talk to you?

08:52.233 --> 08:53.300
Go away.

08:53.367 --> 08:57.367
But I can't sleep
because Rose isn't talking to me.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.567
I could care less. Get out.

08:59.633 --> 09:00.633
(knock on door)

09:00.700 --> 09:01.500
(Rose) Sophia?

09:02.100 --> 09:03.200
I'm not in.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.934
Wait for the beep,
then leave a message.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.233
Beep.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.266
(Rose) Hi, this is Rose.

09:15.066 --> 09:17.667
Rose, shut up and get in here.

09:19.066 --> 09:24.333
Oh, I see you're with two double-crossing
ex-friends of mine. I'll come back later.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.700
You think this is the 7-Eleven?
I'm not open all night.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.834
-We feel terrible about this.
-What's that?

09:31.900 --> 09:34.166
-We're sorry.
-About what?

09:34.233 --> 09:37.633
-How can I trust you again?
-Trust who?

09:37.700 --> 09:41.567
Let's not talk about trust
after what you wrote.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.900
What the hell you talking about?

09:43.967 --> 09:45.633
We read Rose's diary.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.433
She wrote terrible things
about us in there.

09:48.500 --> 09:52.066
I didn't write anything about you.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.467
I didn't know you when I kept that diary.

09:54.533 --> 09:58.200
-What are you talking about?
-That was my 4-H diary.

09:58.266 --> 10:02.266
I kept it one summer when I raised
two pigs for the county fair.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.934
You kept a diary
about raising two pigs?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.800
You know another way
to get a 4-H pig diary badge?

10:17.066 --> 10:20.200
Oh, my God.

10:20.266 --> 10:22.900
(laughs)
There's been a terrible misunderstanding.

10:22.967 --> 10:25.100
Let's just forget the whole thing.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.433
No way. I'm really mad.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.934
Okay. I'm tired, so listen up.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.767
You're going to tell a story?

10:31.834 --> 10:33.367
No, I'm going to do shadow puppets.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.834
See, an elephant eating a peanut? Happy?

10:38.667 --> 10:42.667
Of course I'm going to tell a story.
Picture it.

10:42.734 --> 10:44.533
Morocco, the thirties.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.066
The 1930s?

10:46.133 --> 10:48.934
No, 30 degrees.
Do I look like Willard Scott?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.834
Of course, the 1930s.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.133
Three close friends
are haggling over a camel.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.066
How many humps?

10:59.300 --> 11:02.734
None. I'm talking about a cigarette.
It was the last one.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.700
-Well, anyway--
-What does this have to do with the diary?

11:06.767 --> 11:11.400
Suddenly I'm on<i> Nightline.</i>
I was just trying to tell a story.

11:11.467 --> 11:13.900
There's no point, Sophia.
They've done something terrible.

11:13.967 --> 11:15.467
I'll never forgive them.

11:15.533 --> 11:17.400
Can't we do anything?

11:17.467 --> 11:19.834
Absolutely not. I'm unyielding on this.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.734
Think of something
so we'll still be friends.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.533
This time, you've crossed the line.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.033
If I can't trust you,
we can't be friends.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.834
The relationship is over. Good bye.

11:34.567 --> 11:35.500
(sighs)

11:37.734 --> 11:41.066
I got out in the hall,
and I missed you guys already.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.400
Please, let's be friends.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.367
-Oh. Oh.
-Oh.

11:45.433 --> 11:47.066
Oh, I love you guys.

11:47.133 --> 11:49.000
Great. Now get out.

11:49.066 --> 11:51.433
Oh, let's not fight anymore.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.600
Fine, get out.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.400
You're my best friends.

11:55.467 --> 11:57.166
I said get out!

11:59.633 --> 12:03.066
-Look at all that money!
-Gosh, there's thousands.

12:03.133 --> 12:05.934
-Where did this come from?
-Rocco's bag.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.200
Where did Rocco get this money?

12:08.266 --> 12:11.200
I don't know,
but the next time we go to the colonel,

12:11.266 --> 12:14.233
I'm getting all white meat
and a biscuit.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.333
I do not believe this.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.734
I'm telling you,
there are thousands here.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.166
Ma, how could Rocco
have this much money?

12:25.233 --> 12:27.066
I'm as confused as you.

12:27.133 --> 12:30.166
He had that satchel
at the bank today.

12:30.233 --> 12:33.200
Maybe you better tell us exactly
what happened.

12:33.266 --> 12:36.834
At the bank,
he told me to keep the motor running.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.333
Five minutes later, he ran out.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.967
Did you ask him why?

12:42.033 --> 12:46.233
No. The man is taking diuretics
for a prostate problem.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.066
His whole life is a 50-yard dash.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.367
He robbed a bank.
I'm calling the police.

12:54.433 --> 12:57.300
No, wait.
He didn't rob that bank.

12:57.367 --> 13:02.100
I know Rocco. He's a good man,
a decent man, an honest man,

13:02.166 --> 13:04.700
and not a bad kisser.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.567
Then explain this money.

13:06.633 --> 13:09.500
Are you a treasury agent?
It's circumstantial evidence.

13:09.567 --> 13:12.266
(telephone rings)

13:13.133 --> 13:16.300
Hello? Oh, Rocco.
We were just talking about you.

13:16.367 --> 13:18.333
A funny thing just happened.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.633
We found thousands of dollars in your bag,

13:20.700 --> 13:24.867
and we were wondering where it came from.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.266
Uh-huh.

13:27.333 --> 13:31.066
Uh-huh. Oh, well, right.

13:31.133 --> 13:33.166
That clears it all up.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.900
See you later, then.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.934
He robbed the bank. Anybody hungry?

13:45.467 --> 13:50.133
(soft music playing)

13:51.433 --> 13:53.600
What do you mean,
you're not calling the police?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.834
The man robbed a bank!

13:55.900 --> 13:58.467
He had a good reason.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.166
He did it for love.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.967
Gee, the most any man ever did for me

14:06.033 --> 14:08.200
was getting all his sheep
to lie down in a field

14:08.266 --> 14:10.233
and spell out my name.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.700
Ma, call the police.

14:17.767 --> 14:20.800
No.
Rocco said he's coming over to talk.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.400
Fine. I'll call the police.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.300
You do,
and I'll never speak to you again.

14:24.367 --> 14:28.066
Rocco admitted he robbed a bank.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.767
It's my fault.

14:29.834 --> 14:34.433
He thought the way to keep me
was to buy me expensive things.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.033
I got to convince him to turn himself in.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.200
If he doesn't,
I'll go to the police myself.

14:43.233 --> 14:46.300
It's the last time
I let a man toy with my affections.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.834
From now on,
it's strictly physical.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.800
Well, I've never been fond of Rocco,

15:01.867 --> 15:05.233
but it's obvious he really cares about ma.

15:05.300 --> 15:08.867
One thing's for sure, Rocco's a romantic.

15:08.934 --> 15:11.367
There aren't many like him
left in this world.

15:11.433 --> 15:15.100
Blanche,
what was the most romantic thing

15:15.166 --> 15:16.567
a man ever did for you?

15:16.633 --> 15:18.734
(chuckles)
Oh, that's easy.

15:19.767 --> 15:24.233
When George and I were courting
and getting to the intimate stage,

15:24.300 --> 15:27.100
we went out in his big, old Packard.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.800
Halfway home, we ran out of gas.

15:29.867 --> 15:32.800
(shivers)
It was dark. It was cold.

15:32.867 --> 15:34.633
So we held each other close.

15:35.333 --> 15:39.433
Both of us knew right then and there
this was the night.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.266
Sure enough,
soon the windows were fogged up

15:42.333 --> 15:45.934
from the heat generated
by our bodies.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.100
After we were married,
I told George the only thing

15:51.166 --> 15:55.367
that could've made it more romantic
was if we had candles,

15:55.433 --> 15:57.867
wine, and a blanket.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.800
So on our 10th anniversary,

16:00.867 --> 16:03.400
George fired up the old Packard.

16:03.467 --> 16:06.266
We drove the same route as that date.

16:06.333 --> 16:11.567
Wouldn't you know, we ran out of gas
on exactly the same spot?

16:11.633 --> 16:16.066
George said,
"Why don't you look behind that tree?"

16:16.133 --> 16:19.066
So I did. There was a basket

16:19.133 --> 16:21.934
with candles and wine,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.967
two long-stemmed glasses,
and a big blanket.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.934
(chuckles)

16:28.000 --> 16:30.467
We had a perfect evening.

16:30.533 --> 16:34.166
Oh, that is beautiful, Blanche.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.734
But isn't it a shame you didn't look
behind the tree the first time?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.500
You could've had
two perfect evenings.

16:54.133 --> 16:57.533
What's the most romantic thing
a man did for you?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.567
Oh, well,
<i>the</i> most romantic thing

17:00.633 --> 17:02.734
was when Stan proposed.

17:03.867 --> 17:07.033
He took me to a very
expensive restaurant.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.367
I went to the powder room.
When I returned,

17:10.433 --> 17:13.700
there was an opened
bottle of Dom Perignon

17:13.767 --> 17:16.633
and two filled glasses.

17:17.233 --> 17:20.567
We clinked the glasses in a toast.

17:20.633 --> 17:24.266
Stan gave me a coy smile,
and I winked at him.

17:24.333 --> 17:28.133
Then I just downed
the champagne in one gulp.

17:29.567 --> 17:32.100
And it didn't go down smoothly.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.867
Later... Stan told me that...

17:38.800 --> 17:42.266
he put my engagement ring
in the bottom of the glass.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.967
-Aw.
-Aw.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.734
It turned up three days later.

17:53.266 --> 17:56.033
(laughing)

17:59.934 --> 18:02.567
Where did it turn up, Dorothy?

18:13.367 --> 18:16.200
On the Home Shopping Network, Rose.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.133
But you have to admit
it was very touching

18:24.200 --> 18:25.667
what Rocco did for Sophia.

18:25.734 --> 18:28.467
Even more touching
if it wasn't a felony.

18:28.533 --> 18:30.567
Still it goes to show,

18:30.633 --> 18:34.533
hair may turn gray,
your skin may wrinkle,

18:34.600 --> 18:36.700
but you're never too old for romance.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.367
So don't give up, girls.

18:47.867 --> 18:51.767
(upbeat music playing)

18:54.834 --> 18:55.934
Pssst.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.700
Rocco.

19:00.967 --> 19:02.166
(grunts)

19:04.166 --> 19:06.066
(groans)

19:10.033 --> 19:13.500
Sophia, I came to get you.

19:13.567 --> 19:14.867
Forget it.

19:14.934 --> 19:18.066
You kissed this pleasure palace goodbye
when you stole that money.

19:18.633 --> 19:22.133
You're going with me. I got a brand-new
Harley-Davidson waiting.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.333
You can ride a motorcycle?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.166
I can't. I pushed it
over here from the dealership.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.500
I'm exhausted.
We're going to have to take a cab.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.633
Hold your horses.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.033
We got something to talk about.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.200
First, how did you rob that bank?

19:37.266 --> 19:40.467
Ah, It was a magnificent heist.

19:40.533 --> 19:43.300
I moved with catlike precision.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.600
Rocco, you're in big trouble.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.967
By sunrise,
we'll be south of the border,

19:48.033 --> 19:50.467
sparkling skies above us,

19:50.533 --> 19:53.433
tropical breezes
blowing across our bodies.

19:54.600 --> 19:57.867
Sophia... you with me?

20:01.500 --> 20:02.867
No.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.433
Sophia, I'm disappointed.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.200
Not half as disappointed as I am.

20:08.266 --> 20:11.934
I'll admit at times your stories
about being a big shot gangster

20:12.000 --> 20:14.100
seemed colorful to me.

20:14.166 --> 20:17.767
But I figured
you weren't that guy anymore.

20:18.433 --> 20:21.433
And if you are, you're not for me.

20:23.266 --> 20:25.600
I wish you had told me that before.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.300
Sophia,
I have some confessions to make.

20:30.066 --> 20:34.333
I was never a big shot gangster,
never a big shot nothing.

20:35.233 --> 20:40.266
I was an assistant cook at a chowder house
in Bayonne, New Jersey.

20:40.333 --> 20:43.300
Nothing like the fellows
you were used to.

20:44.033 --> 20:47.967
I didn't want to lose you,
so I made up those stories.

20:48.033 --> 20:51.700
$45,000 was my life savings.

20:51.767 --> 20:52.800
I thought with that money

20:52.867 --> 20:56.867
I could treat you
like you ought to be treated...

20:58.467 --> 21:00.133
like a queen.

21:01.266 --> 21:03.033
I can't believe this.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.767
I can't believe it either. There's a gate.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.166
I practically got a hernia
coming over the wall.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.100
I've messed everything up.
I'll get out of your life.

21:17.567 --> 21:21.600
What I can't believe
is that you went through all this.

21:21.667 --> 21:24.600
Rocco,
you always treat me like a queen.

21:26.266 --> 21:27.133
Come here.

21:29.533 --> 21:32.967
(romantic music playing)

21:37.834 --> 21:41.400
Okay, Blanche,
you landed on sports, here's the question.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.767
What famous football player
wore pantyhose--

21:44.834 --> 21:48.233
Doug Curloff, Tampa Bay Bucks,
new year's eve.

21:48.300 --> 21:50.900
We were at the holiday inn
near the airport.

21:54.333 --> 21:58.367
The complete question is, "Wore
pantyhose in a magazine advertisement?"

21:58.433 --> 22:00.667
Well, how the hell would I know?

22:00.734 --> 22:04.900
If I want to see a man in pantyhose
I don't have to go out and buy a magazine.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.533
Joe Namath. Your turn, Rose.

22:12.433 --> 22:14.467
Okay, music history.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.000
What famous Mozart composition

22:17.066 --> 22:21.934
completed in 1787
is a Serenade in G for two violins,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.133
viola, cello and double bass
in four movements.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.467
"Eine kleine Nachtmusik."

22:34.834 --> 22:36.700
That's right. How did you know that?

22:36.767 --> 22:39.000
Well,
they always play it during the chases

22:39.066 --> 22:41.967
on the Bugs Bunny, Road Runner Show.

22:43.300 --> 22:48.567
There was this one where Eelmer Fudd
was chasing Bugs and he stuck his gun

22:48.633 --> 22:51.033
down a hole in the ground
that bugs had painted so--

22:51.100 --> 22:52.367
Excuse me, Rose.

22:52.433 --> 22:55.066
Blanche, could I see the rule book?

22:55.133 --> 22:56.867
Thank you.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.000
What say we call it a night, okay?

23:06.066 --> 23:07.567
Ready to go to bed, Dorothy?

23:07.633 --> 23:10.967
No, I'm gonna wait up for ma.
She's out with Rocco.

23:11.033 --> 23:14.700
Oh, Dorothy, Sophia will be fine,
she's a grown woman.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.567
You can't wait up
for her every night.

23:16.633 --> 23:17.800
Oh, you're right.

23:17.867 --> 23:21.033
She's perfectly capable of taking care
of herself.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.567
(phone ringing)

23:24.467 --> 23:26.166
Hello?

23:26.233 --> 23:29.367
Ma, do you know what time it is?

23:29.433 --> 23:32.467
You're what? Oh, the hell you are.

23:32.533 --> 23:35.800
Listen, you are not spending the night
at Rocco's.

23:37.500 --> 23:42.800
Look, as long as you live under our roof
you will abide by our rules.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.734
I should do what to myself?

23:49.433 --> 23:51.266
He... Hello?

23:56.266 --> 23:59.000
Dorothy, is your mother all right?

23:59.066 --> 24:02.200
Oh, fine. She does something wrong,
suddenly she's my mother.

24:12.834 --> 24:16.834
(theme music playing)
