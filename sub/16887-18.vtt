00:30.800 --> 00:32.934
Freeze! Drop him.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.234
Take your masks off.

00:39.301 --> 00:39.700
Do it!

00:45.434 --> 00:46.201
Untie him.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.201
Stay still.

00:49.267 --> 00:50.867
Stay still, hold still,
hold still.

00:50.934 --> 00:52.101
Man up, Charles.

00:52.134 --> 00:54.000
Why would you do this to me?
Sorry, man,

00:54.034 --> 00:55.367
it was a practice run

00:55.401 --> 00:56.900
for when we kidnap Awesome
for his bachelor party.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.034
You guys aren't even invited!

00:59.067 --> 01:00.468
Right, right,
what finer way to be invited

01:00.534 --> 01:01.700
than to kidnap
the guest of honor?

01:01.733 --> 01:04.066
A bachelor party
is a mythical place

01:04.134 --> 01:06.667
where booze
and women are free.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.967
It's Xanadu.

01:14.167 --> 01:15.633
Oh, my God!

01:15.667 --> 01:17.101
Stop it!
Stop it!

01:17.167 --> 01:18.633
You... stop it!

01:18.667 --> 01:20.767
Okay, I'm going to bed.

01:20.834 --> 01:21.834
What the heck?!

01:27.867 --> 01:29.667
Chuck?

01:34.501 --> 01:35.700
Bartowski?

01:37.201 --> 01:38.367
General! Hey.

01:38.401 --> 01:39.667
What are you, what are you...

01:39.733 --> 01:41.267
I wanted a private word
with you.

01:41.334 --> 01:42.633
Pardon the intrusion.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.834
On this moment?

01:43.900 --> 01:45.767
Or on my life in general?

01:45.834 --> 01:48.767
I'd like to know if your
relationship with Agent Walker

01:48.834 --> 01:50.800
is compromising
your job performance.

01:50.867 --> 01:52.568
How do you mean?
What does that mean?

01:52.600 --> 01:56.468
Has your situation
gotten too complicated?

01:56.534 --> 01:57.934
What?
With, with Sarah?

01:58.000 --> 01:58.967
No, God, no.

01:59.034 --> 02:00.867
No, Sarah Walker

02:00.900 --> 02:02.234
is a pleasure to work with.

02:02.301 --> 02:03.633
A delight, even.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.101
I want facts, I don't care
about your feelings.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.733
What feelings?
These feelings:

02:08.800 --> 02:10.733
Sarah, you want to go on a
date with me? A real date?

02:10.767 --> 02:12.434
Sarah, you're the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

02:12.468 --> 02:15.134
I guess I wouldn't mind time
to sort out my feelings.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.834
My mother's charm bracelet.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.700
My dad gave it to her.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.434
I'm crazy about you
and always have been.

02:22.501 --> 02:24.633
My job is to make sure
you're protected

02:24.700 --> 02:28.000
without interloping emotional
complications from my team.

02:28.067 --> 02:30.434
We're going to have
to do a 49-B.

02:30.501 --> 02:33.367
Okay, if you could just tell me
what a 49-B is

02:33.434 --> 02:35.101
that would help...

02:48.667 --> 02:50.633
Chuckster.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.700
Time to flush out
your system, dude.

02:53.767 --> 02:55.800
Oh. Oh, God.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.201
No, I'm good
with my clog.

02:57.267 --> 02:58.834
Hey, about your
bachelor party,

02:58.900 --> 03:00.700
do you still want to do
that camping thing

03:00.767 --> 03:02.501
or, uh, do you want to do
something more traditional,

03:02.568 --> 03:03.834
or...?
Hey.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.867
Chuck, uh, this came back
in the mail for you.

03:05.934 --> 03:07.134
It's from Dad.

03:09.501 --> 03:11.434
I'm so sorry, Ellie.

03:11.468 --> 03:12.767
I'll keep searching.

03:12.834 --> 03:14.667
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

03:14.733 --> 03:15.967
You can't get disappointed

03:16.000 --> 03:17.201
if you don't
have expectations, right?

03:18.934 --> 03:22.101
So, um, I was overhearing
about the bachelor party.

03:22.134 --> 03:25.101
For the record, I don't care
what you guys do,

03:25.134 --> 03:26.834
because I trust you
completely.

03:26.867 --> 03:29.468
Which is why
I'm marrying you.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.301
What is that?

03:32.334 --> 03:35.167
That is the taste
of a healthy colon.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.733
Who's General Beckman?
What?

03:43.767 --> 03:46.733
Video game stuff.
Yeah, it's video game stuff.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.700
It's top-secret vide game stuff
that I-I, you know,

03:48.767 --> 03:50.434
I'd be breaking all kinds
of rules to talk about it.

03:50.501 --> 03:51.800
Morgan, huh?
Yeah.

03:51.867 --> 03:53.167
So if Morgan's
General Beckman,

03:53.201 --> 03:54.234
who are you?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.234
Uh, well...

03:56.301 --> 03:59.167
I am Special Agent Carmichael.

04:07.501 --> 04:09.334
Carmichael. I like it.

04:16.067 --> 04:18.267
Sarah. Hey, Sarah,

04:18.334 --> 04:19.666
I messed up.
General Beckman,

04:19.700 --> 04:22.401
she called me, asked me
about our relationship.

04:22.434 --> 04:24.134
And, you know that conversation,

04:24.201 --> 04:25.733
the one where I
might've maybe

04:25.767 --> 04:26.900
mentioned
that I'm crazy about you.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.201
Well, I tried to cover it,

04:28.234 --> 04:29.501
but I'm not so sure
that she bought it.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.733
Wha-- where's Sarah?

04:40.767 --> 04:42.733
I'm Agent Alex Forrest.

04:42.767 --> 04:43.967
General Beckman sent me.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.067
I'm your 49-B.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.800
<i>Synchro: Flolo
Transcript: yyets.net</i>

05:14.600 --> 05:17.867
<i>For the Chuck team</i>

05:26.801 --> 05:28.734
I'm sure you've all had a chance
to welcome Agent Alex Forrest.

05:28.801 --> 05:29.867
Of course, General.

05:29.934 --> 05:31.400
Then onto the matter at hand.

05:31.467 --> 05:33.168
We're all familiar

05:33.200 --> 05:35.200
with the elusive leader
of a terrorist group

05:35.267 --> 05:37.534
who has been hiding in the
Afghani caves for years:

05:37.567 --> 05:39.467
Hassan Khalid.

05:41.101 --> 05:42.500
I dream of finding him.

05:42.534 --> 05:46.168
A member of Khalid's
inner circle is this man:

05:46.200 --> 05:48.134
Rashad Ahmad.

05:48.168 --> 05:49.934
Ahmad is privy

05:50.001 --> 05:51.934
to all of Khalid's
nefarious plans.

05:52.001 --> 05:54.600
While on banking business
for Khalid in Los Angeles,

05:54.667 --> 05:57.267
a man we believe to be Ahmad
had a heart attack.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.767
He needs a pacemaker and
has checked into a hospital

05:59.834 --> 06:02.267
under the pseudonym:
Harry Lime.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.400
You believe this
man to be Ahmad?

06:04.467 --> 06:06.801
That is the mission.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.200
Intelligence has only
been able to obtain

06:08.233 --> 06:10.001
grainy satellite
images of Ahmad.

06:10.034 --> 06:12.068
Mr. Bartowski, using his unique

06:12.101 --> 06:14.267
skill set, must infiltrate
the hospital

06:14.333 --> 06:16.434
to confirm Ahmad's identity.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.667
Questions?
Sounds straightforward, General.

06:18.701 --> 06:20.534
Yeah, I have a question.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.467
Yeah, I have a question.
Just a teeny little one.

06:22.534 --> 06:24.567
What exactly is a 49-B?

06:24.634 --> 06:26.934
Mind fielding that one,
Agent Walker?

06:27.001 --> 06:29.634
Agent Forrest is here
to assess my performance.

06:29.701 --> 06:31.300
And during
my evaluation period,

06:31.367 --> 06:32.667
she will assume
the role

06:32.701 --> 06:34.367
of the asset's handler.

06:34.434 --> 06:35.534
Thank you.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.834
That will be all.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.767
What?

06:39.801 --> 06:41.567
What is this all about?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.600
I'm sorry,

06:43.634 --> 06:46.734
to discuss this further
would be a breach of protocol.

06:48.734 --> 06:51.200
"To discuss this further
would be a breach of protocol"?

06:51.233 --> 06:52.634
Is it possible that
someone kidnapped Sarah

06:52.701 --> 06:53.934
and replaced her
with some kind of

06:53.967 --> 06:55.667
soulless replica?
Let me guess.

06:55.734 --> 06:57.233
You want to talk about
your feelings, Bartowski?

06:57.267 --> 06:58.434
Please.
Wrong!

06:58.467 --> 07:00.168
That's what got
the 49-B involved

07:00.233 --> 07:01.734
in the first place.

07:03.068 --> 07:05.001
How could...
Chuck.

07:05.068 --> 07:07.001
All right, buddy, we are here
to plead our case

07:07.068 --> 07:08.434
- about Awesome's bachelor party.
- You know what?

07:08.467 --> 07:10.233
Not now, guys, I'm right
in the middle of something.

07:10.267 --> 07:11.534
The world revolves
around the sun,

07:11.600 --> 07:12.701
Charles, not you.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.834
Ooh, astronomy snap.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.567
Okay. It's just that--

07:16.600 --> 07:18.634
we just-- we'd like you
to reconsider.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.667
Reconsider what?
You guys aren't even invited!

07:22.667 --> 07:24.567
You tell him or I will.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.767
Jeff and I...

07:28.834 --> 07:30.534
we've never been
to a bachelor party.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.967
Never known anyone

07:32.001 --> 07:34.600
qualified enough to land
a woman for life.

07:34.634 --> 07:36.500
So, please, please.
Please, please.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.267
Please...
No and no.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.101
Okay,

07:39.134 --> 07:40.734
how about this? As a plus,

07:40.767 --> 07:42.300
since Big Mike
has been dating my mother,

07:42.333 --> 07:43.534
he's made me lock up.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.600
So, we can use this place
for the party,

07:45.634 --> 07:47.267
save a little cash
and guess what?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.634
Spend it on lady dancers.

07:49.834 --> 07:50.634
Pow!

07:50.667 --> 07:51.867
Lady dancers.
Pow.

07:51.934 --> 07:54.767
Hey now. Hey now.

07:54.801 --> 07:56.233
- We're talking serious...
- The answer's no.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.734
Hey...
Oh, please.

07:57.801 --> 07:58.767
Don't-don't say no.

07:58.801 --> 08:00.801
Say you'll wrap

08:00.834 --> 08:03.734
your mind around it.

08:03.801 --> 08:06.200
Hey, does the new girl know
about, uh...

08:06.300 --> 08:07.567
No.

08:07.634 --> 08:09.001
She won't know
that top secret information

08:09.034 --> 08:10.634
unless her position
becomes permanent.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.101
What, what do you
mean permanent?

08:12.134 --> 08:13.667
It's not going to happen.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.068
The 49-B will come in,
make her findings

08:16.134 --> 08:19.101
and be on her way.

08:19.168 --> 08:21.200
Hey, uh,

08:21.233 --> 08:23.233
I'm sorry, Sarah.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.068
For what?

08:25.134 --> 08:27.101
I didn't mean to get you in
trouble at work 'cause I told

08:27.168 --> 08:28.467
you my feelings.
I didn't know

08:28.500 --> 08:30.300
I was being taped
that much.
No, it's fine.

08:30.333 --> 08:32.001
Really.
I've just been kind of
stressed out lately.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.299
You know,
I promised Ellie

08:33.332 --> 08:35.034
that I'd find our dad
to walk her down the aisle,

08:35.068 --> 08:36.299
but I've tried everything;
he's nowhere.

08:36.332 --> 08:37.801
It's like he's fallen off
the face of the earth.

08:37.833 --> 08:38.967
Hey, you've
got clearance.

08:39.001 --> 08:40.801
You mind running my dad's name

08:40.833 --> 08:42.433
through the big Castle computer?

08:42.500 --> 08:43.534
That's impossible.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.034
Damn right.

08:45.101 --> 08:46.534
If Agent Walker

08:46.567 --> 08:48.500
did that, not only
would she be fired

08:48.567 --> 08:49.901
but potentially
face charges

08:49.967 --> 08:51.834
of misappropriation
of government intelligence.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.600
Enough personal time.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.867
We have work to do.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.534
<i>The asset and I
will enter the facility,</i>

08:59.600 --> 09:01.767
obtain uniforms
to assimilate and

09:01.834 --> 09:03.634
attempt to confirm
Ahmad's identity.

09:03.701 --> 09:05.701
Is there anything
I can do, Casey?

09:05.734 --> 09:06.367
I got it.

09:07.734 --> 09:10.267
Casey, uh, what is that?

09:10.333 --> 09:12.068
You confirm Harry Lime is Ahmad,

09:12.101 --> 09:14.233
I'll sneak into the hospital's
high-security area

09:14.267 --> 09:16.333
where the equipment
and donor organs are kept.

09:16.367 --> 09:18.068
Why? Aren't we just
gonna arrest him?

09:18.101 --> 09:20.034
Don't underestimate
the gamesmanship

09:20.068 --> 09:21.168
of the U.S.
Government.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.534
Yeah, I'll place this

09:22.567 --> 09:24.434
GLG-4000 inside
Ahmad's pacemaker

09:24.500 --> 09:26.034
before it's implanted.

09:26.068 --> 09:27.967
When he returns
to Hassan Khalid's secret cave,

09:28.034 --> 09:30.101
he'll be a high-tech human bug.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.200
Then not only will we know
the terrorists' secret location,

09:32.233 --> 09:34.233
but we'll be one step ahead
of their plans.

09:34.267 --> 09:35.701
Checkmate.
Checkmate.

09:38.134 --> 09:39.734
Get the door.

09:43.134 --> 09:44.734
Are you guys crazy?

09:44.767 --> 09:46.400
I can't go in here.
This is the hospital

09:46.434 --> 09:47.534
where Ellie and
Awesome work.

09:47.567 --> 09:48.767
It's okay.
We checked their schedules.

09:48.801 --> 09:50.001
Ellie's not working today.
Devon is

09:50.068 --> 09:52.767
mid-surgery.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.600
Hey,

09:54.634 --> 09:55.867
you're here to observe.

09:55.901 --> 09:57.233
Stay in the van, Walker.
That's an order.

10:06.101 --> 10:08.600
And what were you little
kids doing in there?

10:08.634 --> 10:11.168
A little hanky-panky?

10:12.400 --> 10:13.400
What? Why?

10:13.434 --> 10:14.467
Why would you do that?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.001
Relax, I only tranqed her.

10:16.068 --> 10:18.467
She'll be awake
six to eight hours.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
Now grab a leg.

10:32.168 --> 10:33.801
Oh, hey!

10:33.834 --> 10:35.600
I didn't think you were on
call today, Dr. Bartowski.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.801
Yeah, well, they keep
switching my shifts around.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.801
See you.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.300
You know, that grandma
was no threat to us.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.168
- I don't get why you decided...
- I don't decide.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.233
Protocol dictates
my actions.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.667
Chuck...

10:49.701 --> 10:51.500
your sister is 30 feet
northeast of you.

11:00.101 --> 11:01.333
Doctor...

11:01.367 --> 11:02.367
Yeah?

11:02.467 --> 11:03.467
You forgot your pen.
Oh.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.134
Now or never.

11:06.168 --> 11:07.134
See you.

11:27.901 --> 11:28.867
It's him.

11:30.068 --> 11:31.400
Are you his doctor?

11:31.467 --> 11:33.134
Of course.

11:33.168 --> 11:35.300
Am I not wearing
a doctor's coat?

11:35.333 --> 11:37.901
Who else would I be if not
one of this man's doctors?

11:37.967 --> 11:40.333
Doctor, I am Harry Lime's
private physician,

11:40.367 --> 11:41.634
Dr. Mohammed Zamir.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.200
Ah. Doctor.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.434
Doctor.
Doctor.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.934
Doctor.
And Doctor.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.233
Nurse, would you excuse us

11:48.267 --> 11:49.300
for a moment, please?

11:49.367 --> 11:50.467
I'd like to consult

11:50.534 --> 11:51.834
the doctor privately, please.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.200
Yes, yes, we will be
discussing doctor things

11:54.233 --> 11:55.534
that only doctors
understand.

11:55.567 --> 11:56.667
Please go.

11:56.701 --> 11:58.101
Please don't go.

12:00.101 --> 12:02.200
Be right outside...
Doctor.

12:12.367 --> 12:13.500
Major, what's your 20?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.200
In position.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.500
Identification affirmative.

12:16.567 --> 12:17.500
Roger that.
Proceed.

12:26.967 --> 12:28.233
Hey!

12:28.267 --> 12:30.567
You!
Yeah?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.434
Hysterectomy in 806
didn't make it to the toilet.

12:33.467 --> 12:34.867
You mind?

12:37.400 --> 12:38.801
You got it.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.001
Well, heart sounds
appear to be normal.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.534
For a patient with this type

13:01.600 --> 13:04.667
of atypical
cardio-cardiac condition.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.734
You should know
that this patient

13:06.801 --> 13:08.300
is a very important man.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.734
Well, I... I took an oath

13:10.801 --> 13:12.967
to treat my first
patient with the same

13:13.001 --> 13:16.101
kind of care
as every subsequent patient.

13:16.168 --> 13:17.500
It's a very dangerous job

13:17.567 --> 13:20.734
to be the surgeon
of a very important man.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.667
You understand
my meaning, Doctor?

13:22.734 --> 13:26.200
I'll do the best job
that I know how to do.

13:26.267 --> 13:27.600
Your life depends on it.

13:31.034 --> 13:32.934
If I have to eat
an apple a day

13:32.967 --> 13:34.233
<i>to keep that
doctor away,</i>

13:34.300 --> 13:37.034
then bring on
the fresh fruit.

13:37.101 --> 13:38.134
Hey.

13:38.168 --> 13:39.801
Security system
has been updated.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.534
I'll either need 40 minutes
to decrypt the code

13:41.600 --> 13:43.101
or four ounces of C-4.

13:43.134 --> 13:44.367
Or you could just

13:44.434 --> 13:45.901
take out some doctor
and steal his card key.

13:45.967 --> 13:48.134
I like the cut of your jib.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.801
Wow, you two are a match

13:50.834 --> 13:53.967
made in a very frightening
part of Heaven.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.567
Now, all we'll need
is some idiot doctor

13:55.634 --> 13:58.068
with a key card to get us
into the restricted area.

14:04.667 --> 14:05.834
No way.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.134
No, no way,
absolutely not.

14:16.601 --> 14:18.601
No, uh-uh, I am not getting
my soon-to-be brother-in-law

14:18.634 --> 14:20.734
involved in a government
spy mission-- no way.

14:20.801 --> 14:23.134
Fortunately, you,
like felons and children,

14:23.167 --> 14:24.401
don't get a vote.

14:24.467 --> 14:26.267
Is there a different doctor
we can access?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.300
This mission does put Chuck's
cover close to the action,

14:28.367 --> 14:30.300
risking potential
exposure.

14:30.334 --> 14:32.000
And boom-- the words
I was thinking

14:32.067 --> 14:33.601
just came out of
Sarah's mouth.

14:33.634 --> 14:34.701
Connected professionally.

14:35.933 --> 14:37.100
No time, Bartowski.

14:37.134 --> 14:38.801
Only a couple docs
have that card key.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.634
Your sister's Ken doll
is one of them.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.234
Well, how are you going
to do that?

14:42.300 --> 14:44.501
You can't just walk up
to Awesome and ask for it.

14:44.534 --> 14:45.801
I'll handle things my way.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.067
No, wait, wait, wait!

14:47.134 --> 14:48.367
There will be no
tranqing... no tranqing.

14:48.401 --> 14:49.701
I think I might know

14:49.734 --> 14:52.033
how we can have our spy cake
and eat it, too.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.801
What the...

14:57.701 --> 14:59.334
What are you doing?

15:02.033 --> 15:04.033
Surprise!

15:06.734 --> 15:08.601
You guys are awesome.

15:08.667 --> 15:09.801
To the bachelor!

15:15.634 --> 15:16.534
What are you doing?

15:16.567 --> 15:17.634
Visual souvenirs, dude.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.067
He does quite a bit
of scrapbooking.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.300
You got to be kidding me.

15:20.367 --> 15:21.367
Listen to me, guys.

15:21.401 --> 15:22.701
What happens in the Buy More...

15:22.734 --> 15:24.234
stays in the Buy More.

15:24.267 --> 15:25.334
Oh, right.

15:25.367 --> 15:26.701
Yes, no, I-I got it.

15:26.734 --> 15:27.868
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.801
Bachelor
party virgin.

15:29.868 --> 15:30.801
Lock it down.

15:30.868 --> 15:32.267
Okay, okay.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.567
Hey, hey, hey.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.067
Uh... happy bachelor
party there, Captain.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.567
Well, thanks
for all your help

15:40.601 --> 15:42.100
throwing it,
General Beckman.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.534
Nothing gets by me.

15:45.601 --> 15:46.701
Okay.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.967
Based on my observations,

15:50.033 --> 15:51.467
Agent Walker is far too
emotionally entwined

15:51.534 --> 15:52.768
with the asset.

15:52.801 --> 15:54.634
Her decisions
weren't made

15:54.701 --> 15:56.434
with respect to
established protocol.

15:56.501 --> 15:57.701
She always places

15:57.734 --> 15:59.634
the subject's feelings
above orders.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.634
Is that your final assessment,
Agent Forrest?

16:01.701 --> 16:02.701
It is.

16:03.900 --> 16:04.900
Agent Walker.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.000
Thank you for your dedication

16:08.067 --> 16:09.000
to this mission.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.033
General, please, I...

16:10.100 --> 16:11.300
But as of right now,

16:11.367 --> 16:14.167
your services
are officially terminated.

16:14.234 --> 16:17.300
Report back to Langley at 0900.

16:24.134 --> 16:26.200
Please take good care of him.

16:27.933 --> 16:29.701
I'll do my job,
if that's what you mean.

16:31.267 --> 16:32.667
Well, I'll be on my way

16:32.734 --> 16:34.300
as soon as I say
good-bye to him.

16:34.334 --> 16:37.067
I don't think so.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.234
You've already done
enough damage here.

16:39.267 --> 16:40.868
<i>Chuck's my
mission now.</i>

16:40.933 --> 16:42.100
No further contact.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.234
That's an order.

16:49.401 --> 16:51.134
To finding the love
of your life.

16:51.167 --> 16:53.834
Hey!

16:53.900 --> 16:55.434
Happy bachelor party, my friend.

16:55.467 --> 16:56.801
We got you half a dozen

16:56.834 --> 16:58.067
five-dollar foot-longs
from Subway.

16:58.134 --> 16:59.701
That's six feet
o' meat.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.234
Five-- I ate a foot.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.467
What is the
matter with you?

17:02.501 --> 17:03.501
Thanks, boys.

17:03.534 --> 17:05.434
Gonna be quite a tasty event.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.032
Thank you.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.834
Here we go, gentlemen.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.200
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

17:11.267 --> 17:13.334
He's going to be so drunk
when you steal his card key,

17:13.367 --> 17:15.067
he won't even
notice.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.233
No tranqing
necessary.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.534
And how are we gonna
distract him?

17:17.601 --> 17:19.501
Oh, I'm one step
ahead of you, my friend.

17:19.534 --> 17:22.134
I had Jeff hire some
exotic female entertainment.

17:53.801 --> 17:55.834
At least the sandwiches
are fresh.

17:55.868 --> 17:56.900
Wait, Jeffrey.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.734
Isn't that your sister?

17:58.801 --> 17:59.801
She gave us a deal.

18:06.401 --> 18:07.801
Hello?

18:07.868 --> 18:09.167
Hey, babe, it's me.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.933
Chuck and the boys kidnapped me
for my bachelor party.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.900
Wow, lucky you.

18:13.933 --> 18:15.100
I am lucky, knowing
what's waiting

18:15.167 --> 18:16.134
for me at home.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.167
Hey... great party, huh?

18:19.200 --> 18:21.734
That's very charming for a man
who's so close to temptation.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.933
How could I
be tempted

18:23.000 --> 18:24.634
by a hamburger
when I have steak at home?

18:24.701 --> 18:26.067
Seriously, babe, I love you.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.134
All right,
you've sucked up enough.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.134
I trust you.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.100
Have fun.

18:30.167 --> 18:31.701
Thanks, honey.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.367
Got Woodcomb's wallet,
but came up empty.

18:40.401 --> 18:42.000
No card key.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.401
Must still be around his neck.

18:44.434 --> 18:45.768
We'll have to get it
another way.

18:45.801 --> 18:46.801
Don't worry.

18:46.868 --> 18:48.067
Got a backup plan.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.401
You're still
here, Walker.

18:56.434 --> 18:57.834
I thought I made
myself clear.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.100
I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

19:02.734 --> 19:04.801
Make it quick.

19:52.134 --> 19:53.067
Freeze, boys.

19:53.134 --> 19:54.234
You're all in trouble.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.200
Five-O.

19:55.267 --> 19:56.200
Got to flush my stash.

19:56.267 --> 19:58.033
No, no, Jeff, no, this

19:58.100 --> 19:59.267
is what you've
been waiting for.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.601
This... is Xanadu.

20:26.167 --> 20:28.933
I understand one of you
has been a naughty,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.334
- naughty boy.
- Me... oh, my God, pick me.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.734
I'm so bad, I've been bad,
I'm a bad person.

20:33.801 --> 20:35.033
I'm a terrible person-- ouch.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.601
I broke eight
and a half commandments

20:36.667 --> 20:38.200
on the way to work
this morning.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.200
This is your guy.

20:42.234 --> 20:44.900
This is him.

20:44.967 --> 20:46.501
I'm going to have
to strip-search you.

20:51.300 --> 20:52.667
Uh, help.

20:52.701 --> 20:54.501
No, no, no.

20:54.534 --> 20:56.033
A little help here?

20:56.067 --> 20:57.100
No, no, you're under arrest.

20:57.167 --> 20:58.367
I can't help you.

20:58.401 --> 20:59.734
This is the law,
this is the law.

20:59.768 --> 21:01.100
We're not going
to go against the law.

21:01.167 --> 21:02.334
Be gentle with him.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.933
Oh, my.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.367
Are you kidding me?

21:05.401 --> 21:07.801
Listen, I know the guys
probably put you up to this,

21:07.868 --> 21:10.234
but we really don't have
to be alone in here.

21:10.267 --> 21:11.200
Oh, my...

21:13.067 --> 21:14.601
Wait... hey.

21:14.667 --> 21:16.434
Why don't you just
take this off?

21:16.501 --> 21:18.801
That way, nothing's going
to come between us.

21:18.868 --> 21:19.900
I can't.

21:19.933 --> 21:22.200
I lose it, I, uh... I get fired.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.701
Uh, no, no, no, hold on.

21:26.734 --> 21:27.734
Hold on, stop.

21:27.768 --> 21:29.300
Stop.

21:29.367 --> 21:30.734
I love my fiancée.

21:30.801 --> 21:32.900
I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

21:36.967 --> 21:39.634
Guess romance is alive and well
and living in Burbank.

21:46.267 --> 21:47.734
No, no, no!

21:47.768 --> 21:49.367
I said no tranqing!

21:49.434 --> 21:51.401
That is not
no tranqing!

21:51.434 --> 21:54.933
Can't you keep
your stinking CIA darts

21:55.000 --> 21:57.634
out of people?

21:57.701 --> 21:59.033
Good work.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.067
Now I can access the
restricted area and plant

22:01.100 --> 22:02.367
the bug before
Ahmad's surgery.

22:02.434 --> 22:03.834
Be sure and sell it
for the friends.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
have I no rights?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.000
You can't just go around
willy-nilly

22:07.067 --> 22:08.701
knocking out my family members.

22:10.234 --> 22:11.933
Looks like we can.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.367
Sarah never would've done this.

22:13.434 --> 22:14.768
You've gone too far.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.667
Back off, Bartowski.
What are you gonna do about it?

22:16.734 --> 22:18.367
I'm calling the General,
that's what.

22:18.434 --> 22:20.000
Is that so?
No one's calling anyone.

22:20.067 --> 22:21.501
Listen, this 49-B stuff is over.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.801
From now on, the only person
I work with is Sarah.

22:23.868 --> 22:25.534
Walker's gone;
she's been dismissed.

22:26.734 --> 22:28.601
What?

22:29.933 --> 22:30.868
What are you talking about?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.000
I'm your new handler.

23:08.968 --> 23:10.801
<i>With the use of Dr. Woodcomb's</i>

23:10.834 --> 23:14.300
<i>card key, Major Casey entered
the hospital's restricted area</i>

23:14.334 --> 23:16.934
and planted the GLG-4000
on Ahmad's pacemaker.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.267
General Beckman?

23:18.300 --> 23:20.200
One moment, Mr. Bartowski.

23:20.267 --> 23:21.300
Turn up the volume.

23:26.901 --> 23:28.901
That is the sound of success.

23:28.934 --> 23:30.667
General?

23:30.734 --> 23:33.334
Soon Ahmad and his men
will be on their way back

23:33.400 --> 23:34.834
to Khalid's Afghani hideout,

23:34.901 --> 23:37.200
and we can begin our covert
surveillance in earnest.

23:37.267 --> 23:39.300
General, look,
I understand that this is

23:39.367 --> 23:40.834
an important mission, I do.
But what about Sarah?

23:40.901 --> 23:42.300
How can she be gone
just like that?

23:42.334 --> 23:43.934
It's the way
it is, Bartowski.

23:43.968 --> 23:46.133
No, why didn't you tell me that
this could happen with a 49-B?!

23:46.200 --> 23:47.534
I was under the
impression that

23:47.601 --> 23:49.200
Agent Forrest was here
just to evaluate Sarah.

23:49.267 --> 23:50.200
You lied to me!

23:50.267 --> 23:51.501
Come on, it's a job, Chuck.

23:51.534 --> 23:53.234
No, for you, it's a job.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.167
For me, it's my life.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.701
We disclosed everything
that was pertinent to you.

23:57.767 --> 24:01.467
That's the way the National
Security Agency operates.

24:02.167 --> 24:03.434
Get used to it.

24:03.467 --> 24:07.367
I'm gonna go
clean my weapons.

25:11.934 --> 25:13.667
When it comes to security,

25:13.701 --> 25:15.701
one can never be too cautious.

25:23.601 --> 25:24.534
Who is Rashad's doctor?!

25:27.534 --> 25:29.901
One of the surgeons
put a bug inside him.

25:29.934 --> 25:32.567
Dr. Devon Woodcomb.

25:37.734 --> 25:40.400
You two go bring me the doctor.

25:40.434 --> 25:41.701
When the doctor
woke up this morning,

25:41.734 --> 25:43.334
he didn't know that today...

25:43.400 --> 25:44.734
I'm gonna die.

25:45.901 --> 25:48.467
Oh, my God,

25:48.534 --> 25:50.133
I'm going to die.
I would love to

25:50.200 --> 25:51.701
feel sorry for you, honey,
but I think you kind of

25:51.734 --> 25:52.701
brought this one on yourself.

25:52.734 --> 25:53.834
How'd I get so wasted?

25:53.901 --> 25:54.968
I don't remember a thing.

25:55.033 --> 25:56.200
Well, you drank a little bit,

25:56.267 --> 25:57.534
you cut loose,

25:57.601 --> 25:59.234
no harm done.
I remember

25:59.267 --> 26:01.000
our lovely neighbor, John Casey,

26:01.067 --> 26:02.801
carrying you home
at 4:00 in the morning,

26:02.868 --> 26:04.834
smelling like booze
and cheap hairspray.

26:04.901 --> 26:06.634
Does that ring
a bell for you?

26:06.667 --> 26:08.234
Honey, I mean, please
don't say the word bell.

26:12.434 --> 26:14.601
Honey?
Huh?

26:14.634 --> 26:16.934
Did I have my key card
on me last night?

26:17.000 --> 26:18.300
What?

26:18.334 --> 26:21.501
Did you take my key card
off me or not?

26:21.567 --> 26:22.934
No, I didn't take
your key card off.

26:22.968 --> 26:24.400
I'm sure it's here somewhere.

26:24.434 --> 26:25.868
Oh, God.

26:25.934 --> 26:26.667
It's always around your neck,
under your shirt.

26:28.100 --> 26:29.601
Whdid your shirt come off?

26:31.701 --> 26:33.901
Well, do you want to tell me
if your pants stayed on?!

26:33.934 --> 26:37.467
Ellie, please, will you just
help me look for the key card?

26:37.534 --> 26:39.133
Guys, guys, it'll turn up,

26:39.200 --> 26:40.434
I just know it.

26:40.501 --> 26:41.701
You know, I'm, I'm really sorry

26:41.734 --> 26:42.734
that you don't remember

26:42.767 --> 26:44.000
what happened last night.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.200
I hope whatever it was,
it was worth it.

26:48.367 --> 26:50.834
Dude, I wish I had a do-over

26:50.868 --> 26:52.100
for last night.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.334
I'd take it all back.

27:01.367 --> 27:02.834
Can you believe Walker?

27:02.868 --> 27:04.300
What about her?

27:04.367 --> 27:06.100
Getting all wrapped up
in the asset?

27:06.133 --> 27:09.334
Clearly her feelings have
jeopardized your missions.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.801
You must be relieved
that she's gone.

27:10.868 --> 27:13.934
Things can now finally
be professional.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.634
Agent Forrest,

27:15.701 --> 27:16.734
for the record...

27:19.634 --> 27:21.634
Either something's wrong
with our equipment...

27:21.701 --> 27:22.868
Or something's wrong with Ahmad.

27:24.734 --> 27:26.033
Hey, Casey, it's me.

27:26.067 --> 27:28.300
Look, uh, we got to get Awesome
his key card back

27:28.367 --> 27:29.701
or he's going to be
in big trouble.

27:29.734 --> 27:31.701
We must find this
doctor at once.

27:35.601 --> 27:37.434
Which one is
his apartment?

27:41.467 --> 27:43.267
What are we going to
do with the doctor?

27:43.300 --> 27:45.100
That is up to the boss.

27:45.133 --> 27:46.601
Awesome, Awesome.

28:03.434 --> 28:05.734
Hi, I'm Dr. Woodcomb, can...?

28:12.367 --> 28:14.434
Government issue.

28:23.801 --> 28:26.434
Doesn't make any...

28:26.467 --> 28:27.567
This...

28:28.701 --> 28:31.167
Oh, my God,
it smells like Heaven.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.100
Okay, that means either someone
is baking sugar cookies

28:34.133 --> 28:34.734
or that is...

28:37.367 --> 28:39.534
I need to ask you a favor.

28:39.601 --> 28:41.067
Anything, anything--
you can have my firstborn.

28:43.601 --> 28:45.100
I need to know
what happened last night

28:45.167 --> 28:47.033
at Devon's bachelor party.

28:47.067 --> 28:48.667
Come on, El, you
can't ask me that.

28:48.701 --> 28:50.200
There's a bro code.

28:50.267 --> 28:52.067
Please, Morgan.

28:52.133 --> 28:53.701
I'm sorry, I can't.

28:53.734 --> 28:55.701
I have to lock it down.

28:55.801 --> 28:57.634
I just-- that's what I--
but listen to me, I...

29:06.634 --> 29:08.067
Oh, my God.

29:08.133 --> 29:09.634
I know.

29:09.667 --> 29:10.767
Can you believe our
first bachelor party was

29:10.834 --> 29:11.667
so freaking awes--?

29:13.334 --> 29:15.834
Ellie.

29:15.868 --> 29:18.000
Wait,
wait, wait,

29:18.033 --> 29:20.801
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,

29:20.868 --> 29:21.868
Elizabeth, Eleanor, Elton.

29:59.033 --> 29:59.934
Got nothing.

29:59.968 --> 30:02.067
Me neither.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.367
Casey.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.334
I can't get in.
I don't have access.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.567
She's off the assignment.

30:06.634 --> 30:07.567
Look,

30:07.634 --> 30:09.634
I think Chuck's in trouble.

30:09.701 --> 30:11.334
He never goes anywhere
without his phone.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.901
She's right.

30:12.934 --> 30:15.501
Now, Forrest, what I was
going to say earlier--

30:15.567 --> 30:17.234
I disagree
with your assessment.

30:17.300 --> 30:18.300
About what?

30:18.367 --> 30:19.300
Walker.

30:19.367 --> 30:21.234
She's a pro.

30:21.267 --> 30:23.434
Not only that, she's the best
damn partner I ever had.

30:28.234 --> 30:30.367
I found this when I went
to say good-bye

30:30.434 --> 30:31.767
to Chuck.

30:31.801 --> 30:33.801
Which directly
disobeyed an order.

30:33.834 --> 30:35.067
You were fired

30:35.100 --> 30:36.601
for exactly
this reason.

30:36.634 --> 30:38.667
Then there's nothing stopping
me from kicking your ass.

30:44.334 --> 30:46.400
Chuck's in the courtyard.

30:46.467 --> 30:47.767
He's fine.

30:57.934 --> 31:00.267
We lost the surveillance
signal from Ahmad's heart.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.634
Got to be a
connection

31:01.667 --> 31:02.701
between the signal's
disappearance and Chuck's.

31:02.767 --> 31:03.834
I don't understand.

31:03.901 --> 31:05.968
Isn't the GLG4000
specifically designed

31:06.000 --> 31:08.133
- to track deep inside the Afghani caves?
- Yeah.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.434
You'd need at least six feet
of solid steel

31:09.467 --> 31:10.534
to block that signal.

31:12.968 --> 31:15.467
This is the last location
his heart registered

31:15.501 --> 31:17.067
before going off-grid.

31:17.133 --> 31:18.801
Overlay the satellite image.

31:20.133 --> 31:22.601
Wait a minute.

31:26.300 --> 31:27.767
They're in a
bank vault.
Yeah,

31:27.801 --> 31:29.033
that would do it.
Great work, Walker.

31:40.133 --> 31:43.000
Okay, Dr. Woodcomb,

31:43.033 --> 31:44.834
time for you
to remove the bug

31:44.868 --> 31:47.601
you placed inside my friend.

31:47.667 --> 31:50.300
And if you don't
save him,

31:50.334 --> 31:52.167
nothing can save you.

31:55.367 --> 31:57.934
The patient
is now fully under.

32:00.534 --> 32:01.600
Cool.

32:01.667 --> 32:02.600
Cool, good, good.

32:02.667 --> 32:03.701
Well done there.

32:03.734 --> 32:04.834
That's how we do things.

32:04.901 --> 32:06.901
I'm going to need
to take a minute

32:06.967 --> 32:08.600
just so that I
can center myself,

32:08.667 --> 32:10.233
if you will.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.434
I, uh,

32:11.500 --> 32:13.467
need a mellow headspace
when I operate.

32:13.534 --> 32:15.200
Quit stalling, Dr. Woodcomb.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.068
I'm a little out of
practice, honestly.

32:29.101 --> 32:31.200
Maybe if you could do it.
Cut him open...

32:31.233 --> 32:32.233
<i>or I'll cut you open.</i>

32:35.600 --> 32:37.168
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I'm bleeding!

32:37.233 --> 32:39.001
Oh, my God,
I'm bleeding.
Come on.

32:39.068 --> 32:42.400
I'm sorry, I just get a little
woozy at the sight of blood.

32:42.434 --> 32:44.600
A surgeon who is afraid
of blood?

32:44.634 --> 32:46.467
I know-- a little ironic, right?

32:48.901 --> 32:50.634
Get the door,
get the door!

32:50.701 --> 32:52.267
Get the door!

33:03.267 --> 33:04.901
Who the hell is Chuck?
Huh? Chuck... Chuck?

33:04.934 --> 33:06.267
No clue... I have no clue.

33:06.300 --> 33:07.901
I'm Dr...
I am Dr. Woodcomb, okay?

33:07.934 --> 33:09.267
Oh, yeah?
Or Devon or Doc.

33:09.300 --> 33:10.567
Or sometimes people
call me Captain Awesome,

33:10.600 --> 33:12.001
but I have no idea who this...

33:12.068 --> 33:13.200
who this Chuck...

33:13.267 --> 33:14.901
<i>Oh, you mean that Chuck.</i>

33:14.934 --> 33:16.134
You're a dead man, Chuck.

33:20.901 --> 33:22.367
Now Chuck is
locked inside

33:22.434 --> 33:23.567
with one of Interpol's
most wanted.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.567
It is your job
to protect him, damn it.

33:30.101 --> 33:31.200
I've got nitroglycerin

33:31.267 --> 33:32.767
and a blasting cap
in the van.

33:32.801 --> 33:34.233
I'll have this door off
in no time.

33:34.300 --> 33:37.101
Hold on, I think I saw
a nitrous setup in there.

33:37.134 --> 33:38.367
You're gonna blast
the door open,

33:38.434 --> 33:39.667
are you're gonna kill Chuck
in the process.

33:39.701 --> 33:41.901
Come on, come on!

33:41.967 --> 33:44.500
What makes you think
he's not already dead?

33:44.534 --> 33:45.967
Come here!

34:15.068 --> 34:17.333
What?

34:17.367 --> 34:19.034
What... what is it?

34:20.500 --> 34:23.634
I forgot why I was mad at you.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.068
I was gonna cut you with this.

34:36.233 --> 34:37.567
That's odd.

34:37.634 --> 34:39.634
I think I hear Chuck laughing.

34:39.701 --> 34:40.833
Here, give me
the walkie.

34:40.867 --> 34:42.600
I'll handle it.

34:46.801 --> 34:47.833
You're lying.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.867
No, I'm not.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.367
Think about it.

34:50.434 --> 34:53.101
Ladybugs can't
all be ladies.

34:53.168 --> 34:55.634
I mean, that's
just crazy.

34:55.701 --> 34:57.267
Then, how would we get
little ladybugs?

34:57.333 --> 34:58.567
You know
what I mean?

34:58.600 --> 35:00.434
Chuck, can you hear me?

35:00.500 --> 35:01.534
Hey, your
pocket's talking.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.734
Oh, hey, can
I get that?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.200
Yeah.

35:04.233 --> 35:05.434
Hi.
Hi.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.367
Hi, yeah, I'm fine.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.667
I'm fine.

35:08.701 --> 35:11.367
I'm... I'm also
high from nitrous,

35:11.400 --> 35:15.101
but so is... so is my
man, Zamir, here, so...

35:15.134 --> 35:17.034
But I'm not coming out
until you find Sarah

35:17.101 --> 35:18.934
and you bring
her back here.
That's right.

35:18.967 --> 35:20.467
Stand your ground.

35:20.534 --> 35:21.901
Like Hassan Khalid.

35:24.068 --> 35:26.134
Hey, where is
that guy, anyway?

35:26.200 --> 35:27.934
'Cause I haven't seen
him around in a while.

35:29.134 --> 35:30.834
He's in the Eastern

35:30.901 --> 35:32.034
Karakoram caves.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.034
All right.

35:38.068 --> 35:39.168
Good for him.

35:41.101 --> 35:42.600
He's a bad dude, huh?

35:42.634 --> 35:45.333
Hey, Chuck,
turn off the gas, idiot.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.168
You inhale too much
of that stuff, it'll kill you.

35:47.267 --> 35:49.333
We're going to die.

35:53.001 --> 35:54.168
You're gonna die!

35:55.567 --> 35:57.467
Open this door
right now.

35:57.534 --> 35:59.300
No, look,

35:59.333 --> 36:01.068
I'm not listening to you, okay?

36:01.101 --> 36:02.333
This isn't working.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.767
I can't risk this
going any further.

36:03.801 --> 36:05.068
I'm getting the nitro.

36:05.101 --> 36:06.901
Forrest, we can
do this your way,

36:06.934 --> 36:07.901
or we can
actually save

36:07.934 --> 36:09.333
the asset.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.467
Here.
Sarah.

36:30.634 --> 36:32.434
Is it really you,

36:32.467 --> 36:34.134
or am I
super stoned?

36:34.168 --> 36:35.500
Uh, both.

36:39.801 --> 36:42.567
Both Rashad Ahmad
and Dr. Zamir are in custody.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.067
Though the mission didn't go
according to plan,

36:45.100 --> 36:48.234
Chuck was able to ascertain the
hidden location of terrorist,

36:48.300 --> 36:49.501
Hassan Khalid.

36:49.567 --> 36:51.501
Thank you, Agent Forrest.

36:51.567 --> 36:52.667
Just doing my
job, General.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.200
Agent Walker,

36:57.234 --> 36:59.400
despite your heroism,

36:59.467 --> 37:01.133
you have directly disobeyed
several orders.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.267
Wait, General.

37:03.567 --> 37:04.734
I'm sorry, but-but...
isn't the most

37:04.767 --> 37:06.868
important part
of being my handler making sure

37:06.901 --> 37:08.434
- that I stay alive?
- It's okay, Chuck.

37:08.501 --> 37:09.834
No, it's not.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.701
Let him finish.

37:16.467 --> 37:17.367
Thanks.

37:18.534 --> 37:20.334
Um... General...

37:20.400 --> 37:22.334
what I'm trying
to say is that...

37:22.400 --> 37:27.234
I think that maybe because my
relationship with Sarah is so...

37:30.367 --> 37:32.367
You know, we're...
we're close.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.534
We care about
each other.

37:33.567 --> 37:34.868
That's what I'm
trying to say,

37:34.934 --> 37:37.367
and I know it's not
protocol or whatever,

37:37.400 --> 37:39.767
but it's those feelings
that wound up saving my life.

37:44.033 --> 37:46.267
Agent Forrest diagnosed

37:46.300 --> 37:48.601
your emotional connection
as a liability.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.467
But I suppose
it can also be an asset

37:52.534 --> 37:54.133
to the...

37:54.200 --> 37:56.234
well, asset.

37:56.300 --> 37:59.000
You may resume your post,
Agent Walker.

37:59.067 --> 38:00.934
We hope not to see you too soon,

38:00.968 --> 38:02.234
Agent Forrest.

38:03.934 --> 38:05.567
That's all.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.067
no, this isn't...
this isn't what you think.

38:26.133 --> 38:27.601
Yes, it is, Chuck.

38:27.634 --> 38:29.434
It's exactly what I think it is.

38:29.501 --> 38:31.634
I can't believe that you
are covering for him.

38:31.667 --> 38:33.334
Nothing happened
at the bachelor party.

38:33.367 --> 38:34.901
He didn't do anything,
I swear it.

38:34.968 --> 38:36.901
Chuck, I saw the photos, okay?

38:39.367 --> 38:40.601
I'm sorry.

38:40.634 --> 38:42.200
I know you're just trying
to protect him.

38:42.267 --> 38:43.467
Bro code, whatever,

38:43.534 --> 38:45.033
but, Chuck, Iam your sister.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.601
You're supposed to protect me.

38:58.801 --> 39:00.400
Sarah, please,
I am freaking out, okay?

39:00.467 --> 39:01.801
I don't know
who else to talk to,

39:01.868 --> 39:03.934
but I also don't want to get you
in more trouble at work.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.300
It's okay-- this is
my private residence.

39:05.334 --> 39:06.801
There is no surveillance
that can talk to me.

39:06.868 --> 39:08.033
I don't know
what to do.

39:08.067 --> 39:09.501
Ever since you guys
rolled into town,

39:09.534 --> 39:12.400
my life has been... has been
spinning out of control.

39:12.467 --> 39:14.133
My whole world
is about juggling lies.

39:14.167 --> 39:15.200
It's like...

39:15.267 --> 39:16.367
it's like this.

39:16.434 --> 39:18.234
I bet this is a...
what, a submachine gun?

39:18.300 --> 39:19.901
No, it dries
my hair.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.400
Okay, fine, but everything else
is completely screwed up.

39:31.033 --> 39:33.634
I just want to be able
to tell Ellie the truth

39:33.701 --> 39:36.033
about who I am and what I do.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.200
I can't believe how much

39:40.234 --> 39:43.534
the United States Government
has hurt the people that I love.

39:45.234 --> 39:46.801
Well, maybe it's time

39:46.868 --> 39:49.234
for the United States Government
to help you.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.968
Chuck, you saved my life, man.

40:05.033 --> 40:07.701
Thanks for finding my key card.

40:07.734 --> 40:09.634
Dude?

40:10.868 --> 40:12.968
Special Agent Carmichael.

40:22.234 --> 40:24.267
Nah.

40:43.434 --> 40:45.133
Well, you, uh...

40:45.167 --> 40:48.434
probably had to break
a few rules, huh?

40:49.601 --> 40:51.601
Go on, knock.

40:54.834 --> 40:57.200
I couldn't find him.

40:57.267 --> 41:00.400
The man didn't want
to be found.

41:00.434 --> 41:01.868
I mean...

41:01.934 --> 41:04.400
you had to illegally
access the government's

41:04.434 --> 41:06.501
master database to...

41:06.534 --> 41:07.434
Chuck.

41:08.601 --> 41:10.701
It will be good to see him.

41:11.305 --> 41:17.307
