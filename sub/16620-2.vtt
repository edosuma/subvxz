00:21.389 --> 00:23.222
TINA:
Um...

00:23.224 --> 00:24.957
Is it mustard?
                    Uh, ketchup.

00:24.959 --> 00:27.059
                 We were looking
                    for ketchup.
Oh.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.727
Kids, stop playing "What is it?"

00:28.729 --> 00:30.396
  What do you expect us to do,
             work?

00:30.398 --> 00:31.997
              Yes.
                             No.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.365
        Hello, Belchers.
Hey, Teddy.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.533
           Question.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.901
        What are you all
        doing tomorrow?

00:35.903 --> 00:37.302
                    I'm gonna be
             straight collagin'.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.871
                 Why do you ask?

00:38.873 --> 00:40.539
       You know that boat
   that I've been fixing up?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.141
      You've mentioned it.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.909
        Well, I finally
       got her shipshape,

00:43.911 --> 00:45.644
   and I thought it'd be fun
      to take you all out.

00:45.646 --> 00:46.512
Kill us?

00:46.514 --> 00:47.813
        No, take you out
        for a boat ride.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.881
           Tomorrow.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.382
Ooh, family boat trip!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.418
   That sounds great, Teddy,
       if we can get back

00:52.420 --> 00:54.553
  in time for the lunch rush.
                     Absolutely.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.588
      So I'll put you down
      for a soft "maybe."

00:56.590 --> 00:58.157
                Huh? No, no, no,
                       we're in.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.892
          Great. Well,
   just let me know for sure,

00:59.894 --> 01:02.261
because I got to plan for drinks
      and stuff like that.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.396
            Teddy, we're coming.
                 We-we said yes.
Mm-hmm.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.564
             Okay,
 so hopefully you'll be there.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.199
   I got to go, I got to go.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.435
      That's a mean joke to play
            on your friend, Dad.

01:09.437 --> 01:11.437
What? We're going.
                             Oh.

01:11.439 --> 01:12.871
             LINDA:
    ¶ We're going sailing ¶

01:12.873 --> 01:14.440
       ¶ On a motorboat ¶

01:14.442 --> 01:15.707
        ¶ Do-do-do-do ¶

01:15.709 --> 01:17.876
  ¶ Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. ¶

01:17.878 --> 01:20.446
So, Dad, you're probably
wondering why I'm holding

01:20.448 --> 01:22.014
this chalkboard eraser
from the restaurant.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.615
          What? Wait.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.350
 Why are you holding the eraser
      from the restaurant?

01:25.352 --> 01:26.518
I'm glad you asked.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.719
You see, we've had
some discussions

01:27.721 --> 01:29.288
about me having
my own cell phone,

01:29.290 --> 01:31.090
haven't we, Father?
                         Uh-huh.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.858
Some people say I shouldn't
have my own cell phone,

01:32.860 --> 01:34.293
because I lose things
sometimes.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.861
              That people is me,

01:35.863 --> 01:38.630
         because you lose things
        sometimes, all the time.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.399
Well, agree to disagree.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.567
                        Hmm, no.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.602
 Has anyone seen my other shoe?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.938
        Has anyone seen
      a burger on a plate?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.573
 Has anyone seen my toothbrush?

01:47.575 --> 01:49.475
It was in my mouth a second ago.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.276
         Okay, so maybe
    I lose things sometimes.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.312
      But I wouldn't lose
 a reasonably-priced cell phone

01:53.314 --> 01:54.813
 with a sensible data package.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.449
And I'm gonna prove it by
not losing this eraser all day.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.917
   Tina, I like that eraser.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.119
       I'm gonna miss it.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.820
                    Yeah, it was
                  a good eraser.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.988
                  Rest in peace.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.289
  Guys, I'm not gonna lose it.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.457
    Oh, my God, where is it?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.625
                         LOUISE:
            You just dropped it.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.327
   Didn't lose it. Not lost.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.229
        Ahoy, Belchers!

02:10.231 --> 02:12.397
               Wow, look at you.

02:12.399 --> 02:13.966
          In a shirt, on a boat.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.567
                    Hoity-toity.
Yeah.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.002
 Teddy, the boat looks amazing.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.805
Thanks. It was just an outhouse
for seagulls when I got it.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.640
Just a floating bucket.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.742
 Welcome aboard the <i> Sea Me Now.</i>

02:23.744 --> 02:25.611
So I tricked out everything,
as you can see.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.613
Custom drink holders
all over the place.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.314
I weatherproofed
a couple of loungers.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.616
Secured some
additional seating.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.851
Go ahead, try it out.
Super comfy.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.253
So comfy.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.487
Are these from France?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.588
             Maybe.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.856
And this here's mission control.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.358
                  (whistles)

02:39.360 --> 02:40.959
Wait, is that the steering wheel
        from your truck?

02:40.961 --> 02:43.795
It sure is. Hey, what do I need
    two steering wheels for?

02:43.797 --> 02:45.831
 I can't be two places at once,
             right?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.300
  Also, I popped by the store.
      I got some nibbles.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.435
                          Hello.
Help yourself.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.672
        Oh, cheese and crackers,
              just like on land.
Yeah.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.340
 What do you say? Should we get
     this boat on the road?

02:55.342 --> 02:56.608
           Toot-toot.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.377
                            Yay.
       Boat on the road!
Toot-toot!

03:03.350 --> 03:05.484
             We can go anywhere.
        Where do you want to go?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.519
         Probably Mars.
                     Sacramento?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.121
Wherever
<i>Captain Phillips</i> happened?

03:09.123 --> 03:11.023
        Huh, bup, bup, bup, bup.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.891
            Oh, here's someplace
                    we could go.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.626
                 You know how my
          ex-wife Denise left me

03:14.628 --> 03:16.295
                    for some guy
              that's into boats?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.030
             Well, he owns a bar
                    on the docks

03:18.032 --> 03:19.364
on Menemshewena Island.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.732
Denise works there, too.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.902
We could swing by there in this
really cool boat I have now.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.204
That might be fun, right?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.039
I mean, right?
That might be fun.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.474
Now that I think about it
for the first time, right?

03:29.476 --> 03:30.709
                           Uh...
Yikes.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.877
                 Whoa.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.011
                   Just an idea.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.146
                    Spitballing.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.480
Seems like
maybe this isn't

03:35.482 --> 03:37.049
the first time
you've thought about it?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.750
             Yeah, I was picking
                up on that, too.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.818
     Huh? What do you mean?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.154
     Your ex-wife left you
        for a boat guy.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.855
             Yeah.
And you've been

03:43.857 --> 03:46.091
fixing up a boat for,
like, years and years,

03:46.093 --> 03:47.392
ever since your divorce.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.894
                      Yeah, and?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.430
You actually called your boat
<i>Sea Me Now?</i>

03:51.432 --> 03:53.031
   I don't, I don't get where
  you're going with this, Bob.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.399
      It's a nautical pun.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.202
    Teddy, is this whole day
       all about Denise?

03:57.204 --> 03:59.771
    Maybe you shouldn't try
        and impress her.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.107
          (laughing):
      Impress her? Denise?

04:02.109 --> 04:04.243
    What? Huh? That's crazy.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.078
     We have both moved on.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.080
   Also, didn't she treat you
           horribly?

04:08.082 --> 04:10.415
Didn't she say the back
of your head looks like a butt?

04:10.417 --> 04:12.050
      Yes, and that's why
         I wear a hat.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.253
   And didn't she make you go
  to the bathroom in the yard?

04:14.255 --> 04:16.588
        I was not doing
      a great job with...

04:16.589 --> 04:18.257
    Yeah, and then I started
          to enjoy it.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.392
And didn't she cheat on you,
like, a lot?

04:20.394 --> 04:23.262
          Yes, but I was working
       seven, eight hours a day,

04:23.264 --> 04:24.930
                     five days a
                 week sometimes.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.199
           Of course she cheated
       on me all over the place.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.101
    I left her no choice, Bobby.
Uh-huh.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.602
Sure. No, yeah. Right.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.803
Great. It's settled.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.205
Setting a course
for my ex-wife's

04:33.207 --> 04:35.307
boyfriend's waterfront bar!

04:35.309 --> 04:37.542
      Okay, we're getting close.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.211
That's the bar that, uh,
her boyfriend owns.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.813
The Schoon Hound.

04:41.815 --> 04:42.881
                  Classy.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.483
             TEDDY:
        There's Denise.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.817
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.952
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
            Teddy, Teddy, rel...

04:46.954 --> 04:48.086
Oh...
                          Relax.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.955
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.223
           Big smiles, everyone.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.291
            Hold your plates up.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.325
     You're having a great time.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.893
        And here we go.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.596
      (laughs) Great joke!

04:57.598 --> 05:00.165
  And did everyone get enough
     expensive fruit salad?

05:00.167 --> 05:02.000
        Oh, hey, Denise.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.268
              Crap! (growls) No.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.636
              She didn't see us.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.571
               Well, if at first
            you don't succeed...

05:06.573 --> 05:07.572
                        Oh, boy.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.241
Just got to bring her around.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.510
We're going starboard here,
everyone, or port, or something.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.111
Okay, here we go.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.647
       Teddy, you really
       want to try again?
                Damn right I do.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.582
   Geez, kind of a wide turn,
          huh, Teddy?

05:17.584 --> 05:19.284
     TEDDY: Yeah, it's not
     a ten-speed bike, Bob!

05:19.286 --> 05:20.752
 Let me see you rebuild a boat!

05:20.754 --> 05:22.087
              BOB:
      Sorry, Teddy, sorry.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.655
             TEDDY:
 I got it, I got it, I got it.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.257
      Okay, there she is.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.259
         I think she can see us.
                     Here we go.

05:27.261 --> 05:28.860
                       (panting)

05:28.862 --> 05:30.696
                      (laughing)

05:32.266 --> 05:34.933
     Great joke! Okay, huh?

05:34.935 --> 05:36.968
    Did everyone get enough
     expensive fruit salad?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.104
             LINDA:
    We did. It's delicious.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.939
            LOUISE:
    It tastes like success.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.441
                  Nope. (growls)

05:42.443 --> 05:44.376
          Not that time, either.
           Why would she see me?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.778
        I'm only in a huge boat,
               yelling her name!

05:46.780 --> 05:47.813
      Who likes U-turns?!

05:47.815 --> 05:49.114
    Everyone like U-turns?!

05:49.116 --> 05:51.016
             GENE:
I'm learning to appreciate them.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.451
     We're doing a U-turn!

05:52.453 --> 05:53.719
       Right full rudder.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.654
      I'm gonna bring her
  around starboard. No, port!

05:55.656 --> 05:56.855
        (groans, growls)

05:56.857 --> 05:58.390
                     Uh, how you
                   doing, buddy?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.492
    Uh, I'm doing wonderful.
  I mean, we're on the ocean.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.893
We're enjoying the ocean, Bobby.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.462
   Will you please sit down?!
                     Yeah, okay.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.530
       Smiles, everyone!

06:05.532 --> 06:07.499
       We're doing great
       since the divorce.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.867
       Hey, fruit salad!

06:08.869 --> 06:10.035
        I mean, Denise!

06:10.037 --> 06:12.738
I mean, look at my boat!
I'm inside of a boat!

06:12.740 --> 06:14.306
    It's-- I mean, it's my boat.

06:14.308 --> 06:15.240
             Teddy?

06:15.242 --> 06:17.008
           Huh? Hey.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.343
              Hi.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.712
 Denise, when did you start...

06:20.714 --> 06:23.048
         waitressing at
    your boyfriend's place?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.684
     I mean, is that where
   your boyfriend owns that?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.018
          (all grunt)

06:27.020 --> 06:28.253
        (people gasping)

06:28.255 --> 06:31.056
   So, uh, good catching up.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.425
This fruit salad--
oh, my God, the best.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.197
Oh, God.
           Oh, boy.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.099
Do you think that Denise noticed
that I crashed the boat?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.701
                       What? No.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.436
Uh, I'm not Teddy,
by the way.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.737
        (wood creaking)

06:45.739 --> 06:47.005
    That doesn't sound good.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.540
        Crap! We're still stuck.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.075
               I'm gonna give it
                  all she's got.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.009
        (engine revving)

06:51.011 --> 06:54.045
        (Teddy growling)

06:54.047 --> 06:55.614
        (wood cracking)

06:55.616 --> 06:56.715
          We're free!

06:56.717 --> 06:57.949
         (grunts) Crap!

06:57.951 --> 06:59.284
              BOB:
            Oh, boy.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.353
     LOUISE: And that's how
   you make an exit, people.

07:01.355 --> 07:02.954
               Great job, Teddy.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.357
            There is blowing it,
        and there is blowing it!

07:05.359 --> 07:07.125
       What? It was fine.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.527
              ALL:
        Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.728
Not too many people

07:09.730 --> 07:11.296
were taking videos
with their phones.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.864
        I pretended to take one,
                but don't worry,

07:12.866 --> 07:13.965
       I won't post it anywhere.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.100
                        (groans)

07:15.102 --> 07:16.468
              Not how I imagined
                     this going.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.770
                Me and my stupid
             butt-head. (growls)

07:18.772 --> 07:19.971
      Let's get you home.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.374
       Maybe by tomorrow,
       or next Christmas,

07:22.376 --> 07:23.875
         you can laugh
     about the whole thing.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.577
           Teddy, Linda's right.

07:25.579 --> 07:29.881
         All of this is probably
         for the best, so, uh...

07:29.883 --> 07:31.650
       smooth sailing from here.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.118
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.454
Uh, does that smoke
look extra smoky to you guys?

07:35.456 --> 07:36.822
                         I mean,

07:36.824 --> 07:38.790
           it doesn't look great
            coming from a motor.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.826
      That smoke is coming
        from the motor?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.494
       I thought we were
      slow-roasting ribs.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.095
                Oh, whoa, yeesh.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.664
              That dock sure did
                 a number on us.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.998
Teddy, when's a good time
to tell you

07:47.000 --> 07:48.467
there's water coming
into the boat?

07:48.469 --> 07:50.302
Is now a good time,
or should I...?

07:50.304 --> 07:53.104
    Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
       That's not ideal.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.906
        TINA: Not an ideal time?
      Okay, I'll tell you later.

07:54.908 --> 07:55.907
Are we sinking?

07:55.909 --> 07:58.343
   Uh... I mean, yes, but...

07:58.345 --> 08:00.745
                But-but w-we can
            make it home, right?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.514
  I mean, we're gonna be fine,
         of course, no.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.749
 But just to be safe, we should
probably radio the Coast Guard,

08:04.751 --> 08:06.251
and everyone put on life vests.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.086
         Come on, kids,
     do it 'cause it's fun!

08:08.088 --> 08:09.454
                     Oh, my God.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.623
             TEDDY:
  Okay, we just got to turn it

08:11.625 --> 08:14.359
                  to channel 16.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.927
               Where's the thing
               that I talk into?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.263
Wha-What do you mean?
       The thing that you press.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.464
Wait, it's not there?

08:19.466 --> 08:20.665
          Oh, boy. Oh.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.300
                    What, Teddy?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.035
 You know that little mic thing
      that you're supposed

08:24.037 --> 08:25.871
     to plug in right here?
             Yeah.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.506
    Well, the good news is,
         it was perfect

08:27.508 --> 08:29.441
    for my policeman costume
         for Halloween.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.877
        The bad news is,
 we don't have a working radio.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.878
       Are you serious?!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.645
                  I took part of
                   it to make...

08:34.648 --> 08:36.615
                    I was third.
                    I won third.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.650
You took the part that we need
to talk into right now,

08:38.652 --> 08:40.118
'cause we're sinking.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.886
              And now my phone's
           not getting a signal.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.455
Me, either.
                        Nothing.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.023
Wait, so we can't
call for help?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.358
                  Well, there is
                    a flare gun.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.893
               Every boat should
              have one of these,

08:47.895 --> 08:50.228
           but that's for, like,
               a real emergency.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.498
Yeah, let's all keep our eyes
peeled for a real emergency.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.834
               Hmm, right. I see
             what you're saying.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.235
                 Well, we've got
                      one flare,

08:57.237 --> 08:58.904
               so this has to be
               the perfect shot.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.171
                (flare splashes)

09:00.173 --> 09:01.172
                            Huh.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.874
Maybe a fish will swim for help.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.976
Now what, Teddy?
Now what do we do?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.144
Okay, calm down, Bob.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.480
Why? Wh-Why should I calm down?

09:08.482 --> 09:10.081
Can I talk to you
over here for a sec?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.317
                Teddy messed up,
              all right? He did.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.819
     But blowing your top at him
      isn't gonna help anything.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.655
We don't know that, Lin;
it might.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.823
        Look, just don't go nuts
                on the poor guy.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.393
Fine, we'll just calmly sink
to the bottom of the ocean.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.396
        Okay, everybody,
 I might be partially to blame

09:24.398 --> 09:26.665
     for some stuff today,
      but I've got a plan.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.234
 I think we can make it to this
   little island right here.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.702
          The map says
     it's a private island.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.537
           You know,
 it could be Caffery's Island.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.439
Mr. Caffery of Caffery's Taffy?

09:34.441 --> 09:36.274
And Caffery's
bootlegged liquor?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.410
I think we could
all use a drink, right?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.679
  Yeah, I could use a cordial.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.548
     I think one of these little
   islands was his, or still is.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.183
             I mean, rich people
                   can own stuff

09:45.185 --> 09:46.618
              even after they're
                    dead, right?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.787
     Dead raccoons act like
       they own the road.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.889
             TEDDY:
        Is there a dock?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.190
     I'm not seeing a dock.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.425
            (crash)
         What was that?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.961
        You hit a rock.
      A-A couple of rocks.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.262
Ah, they had it coming.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.897
   Yeah, why not? Why not hit
      a couple of rocks?!

09:58.899 --> 10:00.365
            (growls)

10:00.367 --> 10:02.100
I think this is as far
as we're going here.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.134
We can't get

10:03.136 --> 10:04.803
            any closer to shore.
            (groans)

10:04.805 --> 10:06.571
           All right,
   I guess we're getting wet.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.740
It's okay.
It's just like at the mall.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.809
Sometimes you got to park
far away and hoof it.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.811
        Dropping anchor.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.080
Still got my eraser phone, Dad.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.548
And I'm not letting it get wet.

10:16.550 --> 10:17.782
      That's great, Tina.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.451
It's super important right now.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.452
       Tell me about it.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.886
           Oh, land!

10:21.888 --> 10:23.955
   You sweet son of a bitch,
         get over here!

10:26.793 --> 10:30.095
        LINDA (reading):

10:30.097 --> 10:31.296
      Oh, that's not good.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.764
          You'd think if you had
               a private island,

10:32.766 --> 10:34.833
             you could afford to
          get rid of the danger.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.167
   Maybe it's luxury danger.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.569
(French accent):
<i>Dangier.</i>

10:37.571 --> 10:39.671
   Well, we don't have a choice.
           We have to find help.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.840
   Look, on top of the hill.
        There's a house.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.008
Good eye, Louise.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.409
Eh, I can notice things, too.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.011
Look, there's an eraser
on the ground.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.178
            Damn it!

10:47.180 --> 10:48.446
       Wait. Starting up.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.181
     Phew. It still works.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.516
       (distant growling)
                  Shh.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.751
    Did you guys hear something?

10:52.753 --> 10:55.020
 Do you mean ever, or just now?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.087
                   I didn't hear
                       anything.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.155
What the... ?!

10:57.157 --> 10:58.790
           (growling)
          (screaming)

10:58.792 --> 11:01.092
        Cows! Tell them
   we don't sell hamburgers!

11:01.094 --> 11:02.427
       Tell them we don't
        sell hamburgers!

11:06.933 --> 11:09.200
Oh, no, oh, God.
               What do we do?
               What do we do?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.136
Uh, they keep moving closer.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.038
       They look so mad.
     What's their problem?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.506
And why are they so hairy?

11:14.508 --> 11:16.608
Get a haircut and a job,
you hippies!

11:16.610 --> 11:18.543
How'd you get out of
Burlington, Vermont?!

11:18.545 --> 11:20.512
Okay, everyone walk slowly
to the right,

11:20.514 --> 11:22.180
and maybe don't
look them in the eyes.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.448
           All right.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.317
Looking at my feet, very casual.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.652
           (singing)

11:27.654 --> 11:28.820
TEDDY:
They're still coming.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.388
Th-They're not stopping.
                    BOB: Oh, no.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.190
          I don't like
   their attitude right now.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.392
             LINDA:
   Yeah, they are mad at us.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.727
    Why are they mad at us?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.028
I think we should run.
I think we should

11:37.030 --> 11:38.129
    run toward those rocks.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.364
           Good plan.
Uh, uh, uh,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.366
I'm pretty sure cattle
can't climb rocks, right?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.368
And go, go, go, go, go!

11:43.370 --> 11:45.370
              LINDA: Oh, no, oh,
            no, getting cut off.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.671
                  We're gonna go
                 to those rocks.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.873
Okay, uh, we'll keep
going to these rocks!

11:48.875 --> 11:49.974
            (mooing)

11:51.912 --> 11:53.144
             LINDA:
          We made it!

11:53.146 --> 11:54.212
  Climb up towards the house!

11:54.214 --> 11:55.847
     We'll meet you there!

11:55.849 --> 11:57.982
     I think we'll be okay
   if we stay off the grass.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.918
          Yeah, get off my lawn!

11:59.920 --> 12:03.021
TEDDY: Uh, I can't believe
I got us in this mess.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.522
           <i> Sea Me Now</i> is right.

12:04.524 --> 12:07.358
 See me bring a bunch of kids to
   an island with deadly cattle.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.727
         Not the day I pictured.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.161
               Not how it looked
             on my vision board,

12:10.163 --> 12:12.330
            and not how I saw it
         going down with Denise.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.600
      But maybe it wasn't
     the best plan, I mean.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.502
       What were you even
      gonna say to Denise?

12:17.504 --> 12:20.171
         If you didn't
   crash the boat so loudly?

12:20.173 --> 12:22.340
  Uh, I guess I was gonna say
        something like,

12:22.342 --> 12:24.042
        "Ahoy, Denise."

12:24.044 --> 12:25.343
             Uh...

12:25.345 --> 12:26.678
Uh-huh, and then what?

12:26.680 --> 12:28.113
               That's all I had.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.781
               Ugh, I'm useless.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.617
    Aw. Well, maybe it would
      make you feel better

12:32.619 --> 12:33.952
  if we do some role-playing,

12:33.954 --> 12:35.920
            and, uh,
   we pretend it went great.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.689
      And I'll be Denise,
        and you be you.

12:37.691 --> 12:38.923
                           Okay.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.191
And I'll be
Denise's boyfriend.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.193
Proud owner of
The Schoon Hound.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.062
               Uh, ahoy, Denise.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.131
                    Uh, did you,
            did you see my boat?

12:46.133 --> 12:47.866
      Ahoy to you, Teddy.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.300
         Wow, look at your boat!

12:49.302 --> 12:51.035
            It's just beautiful.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.237
             TINA:
    Yeah, I'm super jealous.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.272
    And that woman with you,

12:54.274 --> 12:56.741
   the one with the glasses,
         she looks fun.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.109
      She your girlfriend?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.444
What? Who, Linda?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.780
No, she's a friend.
She's-she's Bob's wife.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.648
      Hi, you. I'm Denise.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.816
           I'm Linda.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.451
    Linda, I love that name.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.919
       You look so smart.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.155
    And who's that cool teen
       with the barrette?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.790
       I assume she's got
      her own cell phone.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.092
      Uh, I think you guys
are getting a little off track.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.326
            Right, right, right.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.328
          Teddy, you look great.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.663
   Leaving you for this idiot

13:18.665 --> 13:20.465
     was the dumbest thing
          I ever did.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.666
                         Really?
Absolutely.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.901
          She's right.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.335
   You should be with Denise,
            not me.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.970
I've got The Schoon Hound;
I'll be fine.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.772
    Come on, let's give love
        a second chance.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.973
        What do you say?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.508
           I say, "Let's do it!"

13:30.510 --> 13:32.010
        Let's get back together.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.845
                I'm gonna fix up
                  my boat again.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.446
           And then we'll fix up
                   our marriage.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.815
           And scene.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.449
    Oh, my God, I'm crying.
       I just got chills.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.784
                   Can we do one
                  where you say,

13:39.786 --> 13:41.519
              "It looks like you
               lost ten pounds"?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.821
How long should
we wait for him?

13:42.823 --> 13:43.988
Is he dead?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.791
          Wait for who? I forget
              who was behind us.

13:46.793 --> 13:49.494
           (panting):
       That wasn't, uh...

13:49.496 --> 13:52.096
        so... so tough.
            (groans)

13:52.098 --> 13:53.331
                    Here we are.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.499
           Good news, everybody.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.967
                      We did our
              role-playing game,

13:55.969 --> 13:57.502
                     and we came
               to the conclusion

13:57.504 --> 13:59.003
              that as soon as we
             get off the island,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.705
          Denise and I are gonna
              get back together!

14:00.707 --> 14:02.774
  What are you talking about?
   What is he talking about?

14:02.776 --> 14:06.377
      Um, it sounds worse
        when he says it.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.779
  Uh, you weren't there, Bob.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.480
I was there.
I played that no-good

14:09.482 --> 14:10.982
son of a bitch
boyfriend of hers.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.350
          Oh, my God.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.484
                Hey, look at us.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.053
Almost to the house on the hill.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.622
             GENE:
    They'd better have cable
        and kettle corn!

14:17.624 --> 14:19.057
Oh, no, no, no.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.526
We're supposed
to go over that?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.794
Are you kidding me?

14:22.796 --> 14:24.696
                 I'll go, and if
               I make it across,

14:24.698 --> 14:26.197
             I'll call for help.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.365
       (boards creaking)

14:27.367 --> 14:28.900
         That was a super creak.
 (Tina moaning)

14:28.902 --> 14:31.202
         It's super creaky, yow!

14:31.204 --> 14:32.537
      I don't know, Teddy.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.472
   It seems like that bridge
  might completely fall apart.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.808
           It might,
but that's a risk I got to take.

14:36.810 --> 14:37.809
  Okay, good luck.

14:37.811 --> 14:38.910
             You guys wait here.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.246
I was born to be on
Team Wait Here.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.748
                Okay, here I go.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.416
       (boards creaking)

14:45.418 --> 14:46.885
        Making progress.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.152
        Careful, Teddy.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.821
        Wait till Denise
       hears about this.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.257
       This is gonna make
   one very impressive story.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.726
      If I don't make it,
    tell her I died a hero.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.096
So you'll be dead, but you still
want to impress her.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.999
      And kind of, uh, embellish
          it a little, you know.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.935
    Maybe I did a cool flip
   like a diver or something.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.236
Yeah, I guess.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.704
Yeah, we'll,
we'll tell her.
             Okay.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.172
       (boards creaking)

15:08.174 --> 15:10.074
         Boy, this, uh,
  bridge does not feel sturdy.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.876
          Guys? Guys?

15:11.878 --> 15:12.944
       Guys, behind you.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.212
            (mooing)
          (screaming)

15:14.214 --> 15:15.380
Everybody over the bridge!

15:15.382 --> 15:16.281
                     Go, go, go!

15:16.283 --> 15:19.117
             LINDA:
          Easy, easy.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.519
  GENE: I'm glad this is easy
 for you, but I'm freaking out!

15:26.026 --> 15:27.525
            LOUISE:
Careful, careful, careful, okay.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.761
   Okay, the cows are smarter
          than we are.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.229
          They're not
    getting on this bridge.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.630
              BOB:
        Just keep moving

15:32.632 --> 15:34.299
and try not to be heavy,
everybody.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.767
                  Hey, I skipped
                   brunch today.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.035
                   No, I didn't.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.803
      Okay, step by step.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.104
         Easy does it.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.639
          (screaming)

15:41.641 --> 15:42.473
              ALL:
             Tina!

15:42.475 --> 15:43.474
Let the eraser go.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.909
Y-You need both hands.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.210
           But I haven't lost it
                this whole time.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.478
                   I'm not about
            to let go of it now.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.713
You can have a phone,
all right?

15:48.715 --> 15:49.948
Just grab on to the rail.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.616
                 Oh, okay, cool.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.919
    That was a great eraser.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.120
One of the best.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.156
      Terrible reception though.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.391
         (all panting)

16:01.628 --> 16:02.927
             LINDA:
          We made it!

16:02.929 --> 16:03.962
         Oh, my babies.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.263
           (grunting)

16:05.265 --> 16:06.431
                   Who are you?!
          (screaming)

16:06.433 --> 16:07.598
       What are you doing here?!

16:07.600 --> 16:08.666
                Just kicking it.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.068
  W-We're not here on purpose.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.236
        Get out of here!
   This is private property!

16:12.238 --> 16:13.905
                   We know. It's
               Caffery's Island.

16:13.907 --> 16:15.974
      Yes, and it's my job
         to protect it.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.275
    So get off this island!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.310
We'd love to, sir,
but we're stranded here

16:19.312 --> 16:20.778
and we just want
to use your phone.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.613
Also, please don't
weed-whack us.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.282
                  I might if you
                don't skedaddle.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.817
                    Imagine this
                  is your shins.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.020
       No, we-we get it.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.588
          Just listen,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.924
 Teddy's boat is all busted and
crashed on the rocks out there.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.359
                      I'm Teddy.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.494
      The guy with the boat that
      he was just talking about.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.997
    Right. So can we borrow
  your phone to call for help?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.632
 All right, I won't whack you.
          Come on in.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.268
      I'll give you a tour
 and I'll see if I have any of

16:44.270 --> 16:45.470
          my trespasser's punch.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.671
Ooh, punch!

16:46.673 --> 16:49.040
    And this is the parlor.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.442
So, uh, is this
where the phone is?

16:51.444 --> 16:52.877
  We'll get there eventually.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.313
          I'm just guessing, but
         is it just you out here

16:55.315 --> 16:56.447
         by yourself, Nathaniel?

16:56.449 --> 16:57.682
Oh, yeah.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.984
Just me, my gardening tools
and the cattle.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.220
 Yeah, you could put that down
          at any time.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.554
No, thanks.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.490
               And why are there
               terrifying cattle

17:05.492 --> 17:06.891
                    running wild
                 on this island?

17:06.893 --> 17:09.560
 Those are Highland longhorns.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.630
   Mr. Caffery imported them
   all the way from Scotland.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.965
  <i> They were a gift to the love</i>
    <i> of his life, Gwendolyn.</i>

17:14.968 --> 17:16.634
      <i> She was Scottish! </i>
           TINA: <i> Aw.</i>

17:16.636 --> 17:18.636
   NATHANIEL: <i> But she did not</i>
     <i> return his affections.</i>

17:18.637 --> 17:19.871
             TINA:
              <i> Oh.</i>

17:19.873 --> 17:21.806
        Hell, he bought
      this island for her.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.641
        For Gwendolyn, the Scot!

17:23.643 --> 17:26.377
      Yup. And he named it
  How-Boutcha-Love-Me Island.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.212
And he built this house for her,

17:28.214 --> 17:31.349
 which he named "the house that
 Caffery built for Gwendolyn."

17:31.351 --> 17:33.851
   That man had all the money
         in the world,

17:33.853 --> 17:36.854
 but he couldn't get the woman
   he loved to love him back.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.991
  <i> She left him for an Austrian</i>
     <i> count named Lipshitz.</i>

17:39.993 --> 17:42.927
  <i> And the cattle have overrun</i>
    <i> this island ever since.</i>

17:42.929 --> 17:45.229
Wait, Teddy,
you're just like Caffery.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.831
                           I am?
Yes.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.267
Caffery did all this stuff
to impress this Gwendolyn lady.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.102
                         Uh-huh.
It's just like you
with your boat.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.370
                   You're right.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.871
         Yes! Finally!

17:53.873 --> 17:55.706
          I could buy an island!
                     For Denise!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.208
                 That'll help me
                   win her back.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.943
Oh, my God!
                           What?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.845
Teddy! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
                      (groaning)

18:00.847 --> 18:02.180
                          LINDA:
                  Bob, Bob, Bob!

18:02.182 --> 18:04.382
             Teddy, I think what
            Bob is trying to say

18:04.384 --> 18:05.917
              is that you should
            forget about Denise.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.019
        And forget about our fun
      and creative role-playing,

18:08.021 --> 18:09.520
                 which maybe was
                 not so helpful.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.189
I'm still proud
of the work I did.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.558
You don't have to let Denise
know you're doing all right.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.426
You can just do all right.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.128
And you are all right,
all right?

18:17.130 --> 18:18.696
If you would just stop it.
                             Ah!

18:18.698 --> 18:20.131
       Okay, okay, okay,
       Bobby, let him go.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.365
              Or shake him more?

18:21.367 --> 18:23.034
          Or give him
   a raspberry on his belly.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.268
       That'll teach him.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.070
 It's just, we love you, Teddy.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.605
   We want the best for you.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.440
           NATHANIEL:
    Wow, look at you people.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.543
   Listen, I don't offer this
      to most trespassers,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.212
but you folks seem odd.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.813
                     Okay.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.381
You don't need to use the phone.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.617
I got a boat and a lot of time.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.885
     I could tow you home.

18:40.887 --> 18:41.953
You-you have a boat?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.287
       Yes. Got a couple.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.388
       In the boathouse.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.591
           Boathouse?
   We didn't see a boathouse.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.093
       'Cause you came up on the
       wrong side of the island.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.962
                The front of the
           property's beautiful.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.096
Have a look.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.798
 That's the place to trespass.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.666
           Oh, yeah,
    that's good trespassing.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.934
        Next time maybe.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.503
           NATHANIEL:
             Geez,

18:58.505 --> 19:00.004
                you dinged it up
                    pretty good.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.340
   Nobody light a match or flick
       your butts over this way.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.342
           You're leaking diesel
             all over the place.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.943
Did he say
"flick your butts"?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.812
            Excuse me, where can
             we flick our butts?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.881
            'Cause that needs to
             happen pretty soon.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.018
      Dad, I wanted to say
     thank you for thinking

19:14.020 --> 19:15.853
     I'm responsible enough
     for my own cell phone.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.421
   Which we both agree I am.

19:17.423 --> 19:20.591
          Yes, Tina. You'll be a
         great cell phone owner.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.126
    I know. I will. Someday.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.995
    But I don't want my own
     cell phone right now.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.496
                 You don't?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.032
  No, I couldn't take my eyes
 off the eraser the whole day.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.600
         And if you're
      always looking down,

19:29.602 --> 19:31.102
      then you're missing
     what's around... you.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.336
       What's around you.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.273
        Oh. Okay, Tina.
     I guess that's great.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.308
                   Cheaper, too.
     And I think you should
        read more, Dad.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.277
     I feel like I've never
     seen you read a book.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.545
      Okay. That's enough, Tina.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.713
           And have you ever sat
         down and talked to Mom,

19:42.715 --> 19:43.981
             just really talked?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.216
     Huh.
                    Mm.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.185
Dad, no more screen time
for you.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.986
We're gonna have to take
your phone away.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.054
                   Yup.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.701
          That's that.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.735
           Oh!
   Whoa.
                     Whoa.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.003
      Ooh, that's a fire!

20:06.005 --> 20:07.305
        Teddy! Did you do that?!

20:07.307 --> 20:08.973
  I did. You were right, Bob.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.375
       Okay, but, I mean,
  I didn't say set it on fire.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.811
      Tell you the truth,
   I never even liked boats.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.146
 Eh, you know who likes boats?

20:15.148 --> 20:17.582
    Guys that are trying to
impress their exes, that's who.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.150
            Not me.
I like boats.

20:19.152 --> 20:20.818
             Should we be towing
                     that still?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.154
                 I mean... maybe
               we cut her loose?

20:23.156 --> 20:25.389
            'Cause it's on fire?
Cuttin' her loose!

20:25.391 --> 20:27.325
      Teddy, you could've
         sold that boat

20:27.327 --> 20:29.527
 for parts or something, right?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.862
    Or, I mean, I would have
       taken a free boat.

20:31.864 --> 20:32.863
          Just saying.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.532
  Nah, a fresh start is good.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.767
      Time for me to live
        my life for me.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.204
      I'm pretty sure all of our
wallets and stuff were on there.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.939
         Oh, yeah? Huh.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.108
      So... a fresh start
    for all of us then, huh?

20:44.110 --> 20:45.109
                     (explosion)

20:45.111 --> 20:47.011
            Eh. Oh.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.080
    Guess the steering wheel
 from my truck's on there, too.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.915
           Can I get
   a ride home with you guys?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.049
              BOB:
            Oh, God.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.352
   TEDDY: Eh. The way home's
        mostly straight.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.853
     I'll probably make it.

20:55.855 --> 21:00.358
