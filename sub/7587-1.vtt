02:49.952 --> 02:52.353
What's up, fellas?

02:53.323 --> 02:55.588
Where were you?
I stopped by to give you a lift.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.251
Had things to do. How's the party?

02:58.430 --> 03:00.226
Don't know. Just got here.

03:00.498 --> 03:02.401
Well, hell, boys...

03:04.538 --> 03:05.937
...let's drop in.

03:07.641 --> 03:09.405
Oh, shit, yeah.

03:10.345 --> 03:11.505
Tyler!

03:12.414 --> 03:15.212
Come on, Caleb.
It's not like it's gonna kill us...

03:15.717 --> 03:16.777
...yet.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.453
So give me the scoop. Who's here?

03:53.631 --> 03:56.534
The first thing you have to know
is that Aaron Abbot is a prick.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.864
- Treats girls like dirt.
- Okay.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.870
- Who's that?
- The new guy.

04:01.042 --> 04:02.408
He's looking over here.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.875
Don't know much about him,
but I intend to find out.

04:05.048 --> 04:06.776
He's cute.

04:08.050 --> 04:10.884
- Hey, who's that chick with Kate?
- Sarah something.

04:11.053 --> 04:13.181
She transferred in
from a Boston public.

04:13.724 --> 04:15.817
She's kind of hot.

04:22.535 --> 04:25.699
- Yo, Caleb.
- They're here.

04:27.474 --> 04:30.808
- Who are they?
- The Sons of Ipswich.

04:31.446 --> 04:34.349
- Hey, Kate.
- Caleb.

04:35.585 --> 04:39.214
- Hi. You're late.
- I had a thing with the family.

04:39.889 --> 04:42.052
- Who's this?
- My new roommate.

04:42.228 --> 04:44.787
Sarah, this is Pogue Parry,
Tyler Simms...

04:44.963 --> 04:48.695
...Reid...
- Garwin. Reid Garwin.

04:48.868 --> 04:50.028
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

04:50.204 --> 04:52.001
You know,
Sarah's my grandmother's name.

04:52.172 --> 04:54.937
- You kind of remind me of her.
- Caleb Danvers.

04:55.110 --> 04:58.079
And you don't bring
my grandmother to mind in any way.

04:58.414 --> 05:00.678
Good. Sarah.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.110
- Hey, Caleb.
- Kira.

05:05.354 --> 05:06.515
How was your summer?

05:11.063 --> 05:13.293
- I'm Kira.
- Sarah.

05:13.465 --> 05:16.059
Oh, right. From the Boston public.

05:16.735 --> 05:20.434
Tell me, how does one go about
getting into Spenser from a public?

05:20.607 --> 05:23.839
- Why don't you give it a rest, Kira?
- Why don't you give it a rest?

05:24.011 --> 05:26.915
- I don't want any trouble, Aaron.
- I'm sure you don't.

05:27.483 --> 05:29.145
You posers make me wanna puke.

05:29.319 --> 05:31.150
- Is that right?
- Hey, let it go.

05:31.954 --> 05:34.584
I think you owe Kira an apology.

05:36.694 --> 05:40.426
Actually, I think
Kira owes Sarah the apology.

05:46.442 --> 05:47.841
You were being kind of bitchy.

05:51.213 --> 05:52.977
Disgusting! You idiot!

05:55.852 --> 05:57.479
Guys, Dylan just called.

05:57.655 --> 06:00.521
He said he saw three cop cars
headed this way on Old Dell Road.

06:00.689 --> 06:02.282
- Hey, let's roll!
- Let's go.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.018
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's go!

06:11.004 --> 06:13.495
- You need a ride?
- No, Sarah drove us out here.

06:13.675 --> 06:17.304
- Will I see you back at the dorms?
- It's getting late. I'm just gonna crash.

06:17.479 --> 06:19.242
Call me in the morning?

06:19.815 --> 06:23.183
- I could use a lift.
- No problem.

06:23.353 --> 06:26.414
- Hey, nice going back there. Caleb.
- Chase.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.719
Thought that guy and I
were about to go at it.

06:28.895 --> 06:31.419
His friend's puking
sure came at an opportune time.

06:31.598 --> 06:32.859
Didn't it, though?

06:37.738 --> 06:39.729
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hop in my truck.

06:41.810 --> 06:43.745
- Good night.
- I got room. Who needs a ride?

06:44.413 --> 06:47.143
Hey, guys, let's go.
We gotta go before the cops come.

06:49.018 --> 06:50.714
Sarah wants you, man.

06:50.888 --> 06:53.551
- That's bullshit.
- Oh, now. Don't be jealous, Reid.

06:55.527 --> 06:57.996
- My car won't start!
- Hop in with us.

06:58.165 --> 07:00.792
- I can't just leave it here!
- I could fix it for you.

07:00.967 --> 07:04.060
- Reid, don't.
- It's not over yet, boys.

07:06.473 --> 07:08.101
Let it go. It's his life, man.

07:20.258 --> 07:21.452
Try it again.

07:25.631 --> 07:26.791
Thank you!

07:29.902 --> 07:32.236
- Gotta bolt. Move over.
- It's my car.

07:32.407 --> 07:34.272
Move over, baby boy. Now!

07:42.386 --> 07:43.477
No sweat.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.127
We gotta pull over.

07:56.303 --> 07:58.100
You wanna stop?
That'll impress Harvard.

07:59.741 --> 08:01.573
All right, what the hell?
Let's lose them.

08:01.743 --> 08:04.178
Cut across Marblehead.
We might as well have some fun.

08:11.356 --> 08:12.755
Lose them!

08:26.375 --> 08:28.866
- Step on it. Go!
- Stupid kids.

08:56.110 --> 08:57.942
All right, guys, you ready?

08:58.114 --> 09:00.639
Come on, Caleb.
It's gonna take all of us.

09:01.052 --> 09:05.546
Hey, they don't know.
Hit the horn. Hit the horn!

09:12.030 --> 09:16.560
- Holy shit, they're going over.
- Harry Potter can kiss my ass!

09:20.942 --> 09:22.240
Stop the car! Stop the car!

10:11.740 --> 10:13.469
Son of a bitch.

10:17.346 --> 10:19.407
We must be the last ones in.

10:23.922 --> 10:25.946
Well, this is us.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.790
- Just a sec.
- Oh, my God!

10:32.966 --> 10:36.424
- Hate those things.
- And they're all over the place here.

10:36.602 --> 10:37.901
Thank you.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.303
See? Chivalry's not dead after all.

10:40.476 --> 10:42.205
No, it just transferred in.

10:42.812 --> 10:45.008
We're gonna go into town
tomorrow for some things.

10:45.181 --> 10:47.481
- Do you need to pick up any stuff?
- Sure.

10:47.652 --> 10:49.882
I'm in 311. Call me.

10:51.222 --> 10:52.553
Okay.

10:57.564 --> 11:00.659
- He's hot, huh?
- Listen to you.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.103
- Thanks for the ride.
- All right. Take it easy.

11:04.271 --> 11:07.299
- I'll see you later, man.
- Call me in the morning.

11:29.202 --> 11:31.227
You're home early.

11:39.183 --> 11:42.277
It's after midnight, Mother.
What are you still doing up?

11:43.853 --> 11:49.159
Thinking about my baby
turning 18 this week.

11:51.299 --> 11:56.260
God. You look so much
like him in this light.

11:58.841 --> 12:02.210
You know, he was a year younger
than you when we met.

12:02.378 --> 12:04.608
Did I ever tell you that?

12:04.781 --> 12:07.944
Yeah. You've told me.

12:08.452 --> 12:09.920
Now, let's get you up to bed.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.181
So handsome.

12:16.162 --> 12:18.724
He was the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen.

12:21.734 --> 12:25.502
I'm so afraid I'll lose you
like I did him.

12:26.007 --> 12:28.408
How many times do I need to tell you
that I'm not him?

12:28.578 --> 12:32.037
That's the same thing
he said about his father.

12:34.319 --> 12:37.652
You know, these powers...

12:37.822 --> 12:40.657
...that you and your friends developed
when you were 13...

12:40.826 --> 12:45.697
...are nothing compared with
what you'll get when you ascend.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.700
They are 1000 times stronger.

12:49.504 --> 12:51.336
Caleb.

12:52.408 --> 12:56.038
They are so seductive.

13:00.517 --> 13:02.850
You'll suddenly think...

13:04.857 --> 13:07.154
...the world is yours for the taking.

13:08.160 --> 13:12.723
And then you really start to use...

13:12.899 --> 13:15.027
...and use...

13:15.202 --> 13:16.762
...aging each time.

13:16.938 --> 13:20.272
Taking bits of your life...

13:22.312 --> 13:25.714
...until there is nothing left.
- I won't.

13:27.051 --> 13:29.077
That's what he said.

13:32.391 --> 13:33.950
I can't lose you both.

13:36.964 --> 13:39.091
I won't survive it this time.

13:42.705 --> 13:44.264
I won't.

14:01.995 --> 14:05.056
So why do you call them
"the Sons of Ipswich"?

14:05.232 --> 14:07.530
What are they? Like, a boy band?

14:07.702 --> 14:09.637
You know what? I like you.
You're funny.

14:09.803 --> 14:12.035
Not like all the other
stuck-up bitches.

14:12.574 --> 14:14.974
No. They're supposedly descendants
of five families...

14:15.143 --> 14:17.637
...that settled the Ipswich Colony
in the 1600s.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.078
Old money.

14:22.421 --> 14:24.753
Caleb and Reid were both
checking you out tonight.

14:24.924 --> 14:26.481
If it were me, I'd go for Caleb.

14:26.827 --> 14:28.260
Why?

14:28.427 --> 14:30.453
He's just one of those
majorly good guys.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.495
Well, how do you mean?

14:32.666 --> 14:35.102
He could stay here
and party with the rest of us...

14:35.604 --> 14:37.799
...but he stays at home
to take care of his mom.

14:37.973 --> 14:39.566
What's wrong with her?

14:39.743 --> 14:42.269
After Caleb's dad died,
she became a bit of an alcoholic.

14:43.147 --> 14:44.775
So is he seeing anyone?

14:45.116 --> 14:46.481
So we are interested.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.990
- So who's the fifth?
- Fifth what?

14:53.158 --> 14:55.424
Well, you said five families.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.129
They say the fifth was killed
during the witch-hunt.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.961
- What?
- Cool, huh?

15:01.336 --> 15:03.133
Or creepy.

15:10.847 --> 15:13.410
Couldn't see nothing but their taillights
in the damn fog.

15:13.585 --> 15:14.745
But I swear to God...

15:14.920 --> 15:17.753
...it sure seemed like
they went right off the damn cliffs.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.721
What you were
probably looking at...

15:21.896 --> 15:25.354
...were the aircraft warning lights
on the Marblehead lighthouse.

15:25.534 --> 15:28.971
<i>Captain, we have a suspect vehicle
with occupant back near the Dells.</i>

15:29.138 --> 15:31.232
<i>Respond and advise.</i>

15:45.292 --> 15:47.853
We tried to wake him,
but he's passed out cold.

15:48.028 --> 15:49.155
Doors are all locked.

15:49.329 --> 15:51.856
Go ahead and call it in.
We're gonna need a tow.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.329
Hey, kid!

15:56.437 --> 15:57.564
Open up!

15:58.207 --> 15:59.606
Give me your flashlight.

16:04.814 --> 16:06.408
Break out the rear window.

16:15.429 --> 16:16.897
Son.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.917
Somebody there?

17:23.515 --> 17:25.211
Hello?

17:34.161 --> 17:35.890
Hello?

19:27.037 --> 19:29.198
- Oh, my God.
- Didn't mean to scare you.

19:29.372 --> 19:30.963
- Oh, my God.
- Just got back.

19:31.742 --> 19:34.506
Sorry. I'm just a little freaked out.

19:34.679 --> 19:36.978
It felt like someone was watching me
in the showers.

19:42.155 --> 19:43.644
Let's take a look, shall we?

19:45.127 --> 19:46.319
It's okay.

19:57.607 --> 19:59.473
Don't see anyone.

20:04.050 --> 20:07.486
- I'll catch you later, then.
- Yeah, see you.

20:45.301 --> 20:47.600
<i>- What makes you think it was Reid?
- It's always him.</i>

20:47.772 --> 20:50.367
I've never felt it when one of us
used The Power. Have you?

20:50.541 --> 20:53.840
No. I don't know, maybe it's because
you're so close to ascending.

20:54.011 --> 20:56.981
I don't know. Maybe.

20:57.282 --> 21:01.050
I'm telling you, it was strong enough
to wake me out of a dead sleep.

21:01.321 --> 21:03.348
He's only using his powers
to piss you off...

21:03.524 --> 21:06.118
...because he's jealous
you're ascending first, man.

21:06.594 --> 21:09.154
I'm telling you, just... Jesus!

21:10.098 --> 21:11.259
<i>Caleb?</i>

21:27.687 --> 21:29.587
<i>What's going on, Caleb? Pick up.</i>

21:29.757 --> 21:32.486
<i>Caleb, pick up the phone, man.</i>

21:33.027 --> 21:34.496
Caleb, what's going on?

21:35.497 --> 21:37.830
I just saw a darkling.

21:38.001 --> 21:40.662
It was in the form of that dead kid
they found at the Dells.

21:40.837 --> 21:42.965
I saw his picture this morning
in the newspaper.

21:43.140 --> 21:46.132
<i>- But who'd send you a darkling?
- I have no idea.</i>

21:46.311 --> 21:48.371
<i>Something's wrong. I can feel it.</i>

21:48.548 --> 21:50.105
We gotta talk to Reid tonight.

21:50.283 --> 21:51.580
<i>He'll probably be at Nicky's.</i>

21:51.751 --> 21:53.219
<i>- We'll see him then.
- Definitely.</i>

22:19.552 --> 22:21.214
- Here you go, Caleb.
- Thanks.

22:21.387 --> 22:23.015
Hey, Caleb.

22:23.189 --> 22:26.592
- Oh, hey, Kate. What are you up to?
- I'm just stocking up our room.

22:27.262 --> 22:30.756
- Did you hear about the dead kid?
- Yeah, I did.

22:31.468 --> 22:32.729
Did you know him?

22:33.469 --> 22:36.235
No. No, he just transferred in.

22:36.407 --> 22:38.603
Yeah, I heard he lived on
Reid and Tyler's floor.

22:40.645 --> 22:43.012
- Hi.
- Hi there.

22:46.185 --> 22:47.847
You scared me.

22:48.021 --> 22:49.923
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

22:50.258 --> 22:53.853
I'm gonna see if Pogue wants to catch
that new Brad Pitt flick this afternoon.

22:54.028 --> 22:56.293
- Who else wants to go?
- I will.

22:57.066 --> 22:59.728
I gotta run some errands
for my mother.

22:59.969 --> 23:01.061
I already saw it.

23:02.771 --> 23:05.298
- Do you feel like running errands?
- Sure.

23:29.039 --> 23:32.339
I wish I'd brought my camera.
This place is so beautiful.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.712
That's the old Putnam barn.
What's left of it.

23:42.891 --> 23:46.019
This whole place, for miles around,
was the original Ipswich Colony.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.269
- So, what brought you to Spenser?
- A scholarship.

23:53.437 --> 23:56.338
- But why Spenser?
- I want to go to Harvard.

23:56.506 --> 23:59.636
- My father was class of '81.
- That's so cool.

24:01.513 --> 24:05.474
- Kate told me he passed away.
- You and Kate talk about me?

24:06.287 --> 24:08.846
Well, you know, just girl stuff.

24:34.221 --> 24:36.954
It's our family's first colony house.

24:39.127 --> 24:43.657
- Wait. Somebody lives here?
- Just our caretaker, Gorman.

24:45.669 --> 24:47.568
Gorman! It's me! It's okay!

24:48.037 --> 24:50.506
- He doesn't see that well anymore.
- You think?

24:51.543 --> 24:54.911
- Who's with you?
- Just a friend.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.744
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

25:33.128 --> 25:34.857
Caleb.

25:37.934 --> 25:41.099
- You should be more careful.
- I know, Gorman.

25:43.340 --> 25:46.505
- Is there anything else he needs?
- No.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.737
I'll see you next week, then.

26:07.137 --> 26:10.472
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

26:11.010 --> 26:13.444
So you wanna shower
or change first?

26:13.613 --> 26:17.016
- For what?
- We're going to Nicky's.

26:17.884 --> 26:19.112
What's Nicky's?

26:23.525 --> 26:25.856
Hey. How are you?

26:43.816 --> 26:46.515
Oh, hey, baby!
You missed a great movie.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.246
Yeah, I had to get my bike fixed.

26:48.423 --> 26:50.721
That's cool. Chase hung out
and kept me company.

26:51.594 --> 26:53.426
I'll just bet he did.

26:55.866 --> 26:58.027
- What's up, man?
- It's all good.

27:00.704 --> 27:01.933
You want something to eat?

27:02.640 --> 27:04.576
I'll just pick at
whatever you're having.

27:13.521 --> 27:15.921
Can I get a burger, fries and a Coke?

27:16.091 --> 27:18.615
- Corner pocket.
- Great shot.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.629
Well, well, well...

27:26.806 --> 27:28.797
- How long you guys been here?
- A bit.

27:28.973 --> 27:33.570
Just been playing Aaron and Bordy,
and... Would you look at that?

27:36.850 --> 27:40.412
- Blue, cotton.
- Pink, lace.

27:40.588 --> 27:43.956
Boys, that girl hasn't worn panties
since she was 12.

27:51.402 --> 27:53.928
Yeah. Thanks, boys.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.574
Keep the change.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.045
Next time.

28:14.329 --> 28:16.162
You guys are real tight, huh?

28:16.667 --> 28:18.999
Families are real close.
We kind of grew up together.

28:20.071 --> 28:23.335
- We're kind of like brothers.
- That must have been nice.

28:26.512 --> 28:28.571
- The best two out of three.
- Okay.

28:28.748 --> 28:31.774
Hey, Chase.
Mind if I get in a game?

28:31.953 --> 28:34.149
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

28:36.159 --> 28:38.353
Reid and Tyler are here.

28:38.761 --> 28:41.458
- Where?
- Pool tables. With Aaron and the boys.

28:43.433 --> 28:45.833
Great. That's trouble.

28:46.002 --> 28:48.336
So Caleb tells me
you guys are swimmers.

28:48.741 --> 28:51.005
Spenser's best. State finals twice.

28:52.479 --> 28:56.042
I swam for Hastings.
I was their freestyle man.

28:56.617 --> 28:59.348
You won't be here.
That's Caleb's swim.

29:03.091 --> 29:06.255
- Okay, what just happened?
- What?

29:06.428 --> 29:08.362
We were sitting here together,
having fun...

29:08.530 --> 29:10.260
...and now we're
watching them have fun.

29:10.768 --> 29:13.364
That's what girls do.
You know boys and their toys.

29:14.774 --> 29:16.707
- Give me a quarter.
- Why?

29:16.875 --> 29:19.276
Just give me a quarter.
I'll show you what girls do.

29:20.313 --> 29:21.747
Thank you.

29:48.949 --> 29:51.816
Gentlemen, it was a pleasure.

30:23.927 --> 30:25.395
What?

30:32.103 --> 30:34.833
- Blow me!
- Let's take it outside. Come on.

30:35.006 --> 30:38.205
Hey, it's Reid and Tyler.
Grab my jacket.

30:39.479 --> 30:41.539
- You guys need help?
- Just stay with the girls.

30:42.184 --> 30:43.344
Get him, Reid!

30:43.752 --> 30:45.811
Let's go. Bring it on, man.

30:46.555 --> 30:49.581
He made the shot, dickhead.
You bet him he couldn't and he did.

30:49.758 --> 30:52.193
We ain't paying you shit,
so if you don't like it...

30:52.362 --> 30:53.522
What's the problem?

30:53.696 --> 30:57.531
He bet me I couldn't
make a combo shot, and I did.

30:57.834 --> 31:02.206
- Everyone just forget about it, okay?
- Hey! Take it someplace else, ladies.

31:04.979 --> 31:08.677
- Now.
- Whatever you say, Nicky.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.556
- What were you thinking?
- We were just playing them.

31:19.731 --> 31:22.165
Yeah, come on, Caleb.
They were suckers for it.

31:22.333 --> 31:24.859
Why don't you quit
being such a pussy?

31:25.036 --> 31:26.560
I'm not finished with you yet.

31:33.613 --> 31:35.673
Reid, stop.

31:41.758 --> 31:44.284
What will it take for you to get it?

31:44.460 --> 31:46.088
It's addictive, you moron!

31:47.398 --> 31:49.298
You've seen what it can do
if you abuse it.

31:49.466 --> 31:51.435
You want that? That's your business.

31:51.603 --> 31:56.735
But if you use in the open, like you
did tonight, you risk exposing us all.

31:56.909 --> 31:58.901
And that I won't let happen.

32:01.582 --> 32:04.609
- My power's greater than yours.
- Not until you ascend.

32:04.786 --> 32:06.277
All right, go for it, tough guy.

32:18.236 --> 32:20.705
- Stop it! This is crazy.
- It's for his own good!

32:20.873 --> 32:23.400
Keep using like you did tonight
and last night...

32:23.577 --> 32:25.134
...you'll be as good as dead.

32:25.313 --> 32:27.281
So I fixed her car. Big deal!

32:27.449 --> 32:30.044
Don't play me, Reid!
I'm talking later and you know it.

32:30.219 --> 32:32.346
The hell I do!

32:33.756 --> 32:36.089
I didn't use later.

32:40.097 --> 32:42.066
It's not right
using on each other, Caleb.

32:42.232 --> 32:43.756
Tell it to Reid.

32:51.913 --> 32:55.746
Reid's lying.
It had to have been him.

32:55.950 --> 32:57.679
How do you know?

32:58.820 --> 33:02.723
Because it wasn't you. Tyler doesn't
have the balls to lie to me.

33:02.891 --> 33:06.022
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:07.098 --> 33:09.397
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:10.669 --> 33:14.128
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Let's go.

33:14.876 --> 33:18.675
Yeah, let's get out of here.

33:31.295 --> 33:34.196
Thanks again for a great day.
I had fun.

33:35.132 --> 33:37.100
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

33:38.137 --> 33:39.866
Listen, I'm sorry about Gorman.

33:40.038 --> 33:42.507
He's just not used
to seeing me with anyone.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.008
I think I'll survive.

33:49.451 --> 33:54.445
Fact is, you're the only girl
I've ever taken out there.

33:55.258 --> 33:58.022
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:58.828 --> 34:03.597
- And why is that?
- I'm not sure just yet.

34:07.508 --> 34:09.601
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:20.272 --> 36:23.436
Kate, wake up! Kate, wake up!

36:57.754 --> 36:58.743
Yeah.

36:58.921 --> 37:02.518
<i>I just saw the same darkling you saw
last night. That dead kid at the Dells.</i>

37:03.026 --> 37:04.220
What the hell is it?

37:04.395 --> 37:07.422
<i>I don't know.
It's starting to freak me out.</i>

37:08.400 --> 37:10.528
I'm telling you,
someone's using powers...

37:10.703 --> 37:12.466
...and I mean bigtime.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.371
<i>And I intend to find out who.</i>

37:56.292 --> 37:58.591
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:07.442 --> 38:08.908
Good morning.

38:10.143 --> 38:11.840
Mr. Danvers...

38:12.014 --> 38:15.279
...Provost Higgins requests the
pleasure of your company after class.

38:17.453 --> 38:21.118
We're going to study four American
contemporary writers of fiction.

38:23.494 --> 38:26.954
First is Cormac McCarthy,
then Tim O'Brien...

38:27.133 --> 38:31.797
...Kent Haruf,
and last but not least...

38:32.872 --> 38:37.778
<i>...Stephen King.
- Yeah! Dreamcatcher was the shit!</i>

38:41.718 --> 38:45.484
<i>Thank you, Mr. Garwin, but no.
My choice is The Shining.</i>

38:47.992 --> 38:52.121
This is not the kind of publicity
this institution is interested in.

38:52.530 --> 38:55.329
You wouldn't know anything about it,
would you, Mr. Danvers?

38:55.501 --> 38:56.730
No, sir.

38:56.903 --> 38:59.930
But you would know about a fight
at a local bar last night.

39:01.309 --> 39:03.106
- Sir, if I could...
- And if I'm correct...

39:04.178 --> 39:05.942
...Chase Collins was with you?

39:08.283 --> 39:10.047
Yes, sir.

39:14.593 --> 39:17.926
Chase Collins comes to us
with a brilliant academic record...

39:18.096 --> 39:21.498
...and his family trust has made
a generous endowment...

39:21.668 --> 39:23.829
...to this institution.

39:24.004 --> 39:26.939
I want to make sure he has
a positive experience at Spenser.

39:27.541 --> 39:30.603
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

39:31.013 --> 39:32.537
Good.

39:36.253 --> 39:38.720
I understand you and Chase
have already bonded...

39:38.888 --> 39:41.483
...and I would appreciate it
if you would continue...

39:41.659 --> 39:45.653
...to take him under your wing, make
sure his stay here is a pleasant one.

39:47.565 --> 39:49.831
- And, Caleb.
- Sir?

39:51.673 --> 39:53.470
No more fights.

39:55.176 --> 39:56.666
Yes, sir.

41:23.554 --> 41:25.385
What is that?

41:27.692 --> 41:30.024
Caleb's family history.

41:30.329 --> 41:33.127
Did you know that the witchcraft thing
started here in Ipswich?

41:34.366 --> 41:38.134
Every time I ask Pogue about it,
he just tells me it's all nonsense.

42:02.770 --> 42:05.034
So, what did the provost want?

42:07.943 --> 42:10.605
Someone told him about
the fight at Nicky's.

42:12.414 --> 42:14.713
Feel like elaborating on that?

42:16.321 --> 42:19.346
You got a piece of glass in your face.
Hold on.

42:31.305 --> 42:33.330
- Say my name!
- Grow up, dude.

42:37.714 --> 42:39.648
What are you looking at, fag?

42:40.683 --> 42:42.243
That thing between your legs.

42:42.420 --> 42:45.821
It's like a penis, only smaller.

42:50.662 --> 42:52.757
Hey, let him go, Aaron!

42:59.039 --> 43:01.236
Don't be so sensitive, Aaron.

43:01.409 --> 43:03.572
Size isn't everything.

43:05.414 --> 43:06.676
My man.

43:08.018 --> 43:10.283
Up for some foosball?

43:10.455 --> 43:13.391
I have dinner with Sarah,
but I think I can hang out for a while.

43:13.559 --> 43:17.689
- What about you?
- No, man. I'm cool.

43:34.451 --> 43:36.510
You're being ridiculous!
What is your problem?

43:36.686 --> 43:38.678
- Chase is my problem.
- What, are you jealous?

43:38.857 --> 43:41.826
- I don't want you hanging around him.
- Look, he is just a friend.

43:41.993 --> 43:45.361
Yeah, right. I'm sure he's interested
in just being friends.

43:45.532 --> 43:47.967
This is beyond idiotic.

44:01.018 --> 44:02.883
Thanks for dinner.

44:03.554 --> 44:05.989
- How about Saturday?
- What about Saturday?

44:06.326 --> 44:10.263
- It's the Fall Fest.
- Oh, Fall Fest.

44:10.430 --> 44:12.660
Just wondering if
you wanted to go with me.

44:13.833 --> 44:17.134
And, also,
it happens to be my birthday.

44:19.507 --> 44:21.167
I don't know.

44:24.081 --> 44:25.480
I'd love to go with you.

44:37.997 --> 44:40.899
- I should go.
- Yeah. Yeah, you should.

44:43.538 --> 44:48.568
- No. I mean, back to the dorms.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

44:54.718 --> 44:56.653
I'm really gonna go.

44:58.323 --> 44:59.847
This is me leaving.

45:04.730 --> 45:07.198
- Good night.
- Good night.

45:09.368 --> 45:10.598
Sleep tight.

45:23.588 --> 45:25.056
<i>I hate him when he's like this.</i>

45:25.525 --> 45:28.254
He's been jealous since the day
we met. It drives me crazy.

45:28.427 --> 45:31.660
You don't hate Pogue.
You guys are perfect for each other.

45:33.501 --> 45:34.728
Maybe not.

45:34.903 --> 45:36.769
Maybe it's time
to check out something new.

45:38.373 --> 45:40.900
And maybe that's what
Pogue's picking up on.

45:46.516 --> 45:49.281
- This is the eighth time he's called.
- So talk to him.

45:50.221 --> 45:52.451
No. Not until he stops
being an idiot.

46:03.972 --> 46:06.167
I'll bet Caleb's not the jealous type.

46:47.692 --> 46:48.955
Go for it!

46:50.230 --> 46:51.492
Come on, man!

47:04.548 --> 47:06.311
Come on, Pogue!

47:12.225 --> 47:14.556
- He really is good.
- He's the best.

47:17.262 --> 47:18.754
I hear you swim a mean freestyle.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.368
- That's what they tell me.
- Let's see what you got.

47:31.449 --> 47:32.437
Let's go!

47:36.455 --> 47:37.581
Push off! Let's go!

48:12.366 --> 48:13.492
You okay, man?

48:14.368 --> 48:17.894
There you are.
Had us going there for a second.

48:21.746 --> 48:23.179
Whacked your head pretty good.

48:24.049 --> 48:26.176
Lucky for you, Chase was there
to get you out...

48:26.351 --> 48:28.251
...before you sucked up the pool.

48:28.420 --> 48:30.855
<i>He also whipped your ass.</i>

48:31.624 --> 48:34.025
It became apparent
that the view of civil liberties...

48:34.193 --> 48:37.424
...needing no special protection
was not widely shared.

48:38.832 --> 48:42.098
Come in. Thank you.

48:42.270 --> 48:44.866
Twelve amendments were suggested,
10 eventually ratified.

48:45.041 --> 48:47.270
Called the what, Ms. Snider?

48:48.145 --> 48:50.875
- The Bill of Rights.
- Right you are.

48:52.083 --> 48:56.816
Arguably, the first being the most
important. Read it for us, Mr. Simms.

49:00.093 --> 49:03.824
Mr. Collins, you're wanted
in the provost's office.

49:08.436 --> 49:10.928
Mr. Simms.

49:11.106 --> 49:12.437
"Congress shall make no law...

49:12.608 --> 49:14.736
...respecting an establishment
of religion...

49:14.912 --> 49:17.073
...or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof...

49:17.849 --> 49:21.013
...or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press...

49:21.187 --> 49:23.815
...or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble..."

49:26.626 --> 49:30.084
- Provost Higgins. You wanted to...?
- Chase, come in.

49:37.372 --> 49:39.364
You know one of our students
lost his life...

49:39.542 --> 49:41.202
...a few nights back at the Dells.

49:42.444 --> 49:43.674
Yes, I heard.

49:45.683 --> 49:49.415
- Did you know him?
- No, sir. Why?

49:51.088 --> 49:53.218
His car was returned to his parents.

49:54.527 --> 49:56.793
His mother was kind enough
to send this back to us.

50:01.403 --> 50:06.102
- My student ID. I lost it that night.
- It was in the back seat.

50:07.544 --> 50:09.979
That's odd. I wonder how he got it.

50:10.750 --> 50:13.216
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

50:14.287 --> 50:17.382
I understand you've become close
with Caleb and his friends.

50:17.557 --> 50:19.650
Yeah. They're great guys, sir.

50:20.093 --> 50:22.789
I agree. You couldn't have
picked a better bunch.

50:24.698 --> 50:26.597
I think so too.

50:32.075 --> 50:34.669
<i>- Am I gonna see you tonight?
- I hope so.</i>

50:34.845 --> 50:38.145
Listen, I have something to do first.
I'll give you a call later, okay?

50:38.316 --> 50:40.808
- I'll be in my room.
- Okay.

50:41.686 --> 50:44.086
What'd she say about Kate?
Why won't she call me back?

50:44.255 --> 50:46.121
She's still pissed at you.

50:46.458 --> 50:48.985
- Why are we doing this?
- I saw the darkling again.

50:49.162 --> 50:51.223
Yeah, but why break into
the admissions office?

50:51.400 --> 50:54.234
Because I wanna know more
about Chase Collins.

50:55.973 --> 51:00.307
Look, I don't even like the guy.

51:00.476 --> 51:02.411
Are you sure you're not
just imagining this?

51:02.580 --> 51:05.708
I'm telling you, his eyes were
as black as night in the pool today.

51:06.151 --> 51:07.677
All right.

51:41.561 --> 51:43.190
Well, how sick is she?

51:43.365 --> 51:45.960
She came in complaining
of chills and a headache.

51:46.135 --> 51:49.127
<i>Within an hour, she had
a 101-degree temperature.</i>

51:49.305 --> 51:52.537
- What could it be?
- The doctor's checking her now.

51:52.709 --> 51:56.441
<i>- We'll call you when we know more.
- It's okay. I'm coming over there.</i>

52:09.363 --> 52:10.921
They died in a car accident.

52:12.033 --> 52:14.092
It says Chase's father
just lost control.

52:17.206 --> 52:18.606
His real name was Pope.

52:18.776 --> 52:23.145
Chase Goodwin Pope.
Born July 14th, 1988.

52:23.314 --> 52:25.646
The Collins adopted him
after his mother died...

52:25.817 --> 52:28.081
...when he was 2 years old.

52:29.554 --> 52:33.219
- When did you say his birthday was?
- July 14th.

52:36.129 --> 52:38.429
That's the same day
his adoptive parents died.

52:39.803 --> 52:42.829
- What year was he born?
- 1988.

52:46.444 --> 52:48.970
They died on his 18th birthday.

53:47.821 --> 53:50.814
Why are you taking her to the hospital
at Gloucester?

53:50.992 --> 53:53.051
Her temperature's jumped to 105...

53:53.227 --> 53:56.025
...and she's showing symptoms
of anaphylactic shock.

53:56.197 --> 54:00.794
- What does that mean?
- It's a severe allergic reaction.

54:00.968 --> 54:04.167
- To what?
- We're not sure.

54:04.741 --> 54:07.233
It's as if she'd been bitten
by hundreds of insects.

54:08.380 --> 54:10.246
Like spiders.

54:22.829 --> 54:25.595
Goodwin Pope. Goodwin Pope.

54:25.768 --> 54:27.634
Goodwin, Goodwin. Goodwin Pope.

54:27.805 --> 54:29.396
Agnes Goodwin Pope.

54:29.573 --> 54:32.406
- That's where I've heard it before.
- What are you talking about?

54:32.577 --> 54:35.045
<i>The Book of Damnation.
They used to call her Goody Pope.</i>

54:35.214 --> 54:36.339
Do you remember her?

54:36.515 --> 54:39.541
I haven't read the Book
since we were kids.

54:40.384 --> 54:42.547
Just call Reid and Tyler.

55:16.797 --> 55:17.822
I told them everything.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.027
About the darkling,
what we found in his file...

55:44.632 --> 55:46.430
It's a list of names...

55:46.602 --> 55:49.266
...who brought charges against
John Putnam and his family...

55:49.439 --> 55:52.273
...during the Salem hunt.
Pope was one of them.

55:52.677 --> 55:54.508
Goody Pope.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.446
Widow of Jacob, mother to Hagen.

55:57.616 --> 55:58.982
So what?

55:59.152 --> 56:03.715
So she claims that John Putnam came
to her as an incubus in her dreams...

56:04.759 --> 56:06.817
...after she was widowed.

56:06.994 --> 56:10.488
The Book also records births
and deaths during the damnation.

56:10.965 --> 56:15.905
Goody Pope's husband, Jacob,
died June fourth, 1692.

56:16.341 --> 56:20.938
Her son, Hagen,
was born April 11th, 1693.

56:23.482 --> 56:25.507
That's 10 months and 24 days later.

56:33.963 --> 56:35.396
If what you're saying is true...

56:35.564 --> 56:38.625
...and Hagen Pope is the bastard son
of John Putnam...

56:38.801 --> 56:42.168
...then the fifth bloodline
in the Covenant didn't end in Salem.

56:45.442 --> 56:49.106
- And Chase is one of us.
- That's crazy.

56:49.413 --> 56:51.279
He can't be.

56:51.449 --> 56:53.750
The night after the party
at the Dells...

56:53.921 --> 56:55.980
...someone was using.

56:56.290 --> 56:58.281
The Power was strong enough
to wake me.

56:58.460 --> 57:00.256
The next night, it happened again.

57:00.429 --> 57:02.260
- I felt it then.
- See? I told you.

57:02.431 --> 57:03.659
I felt it too.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.263
When you said it wasn't you,
were you lying?

57:08.037 --> 57:09.800
No.

57:10.475 --> 57:14.310
- You swear?
- I swear.

57:20.253 --> 57:21.619
Then it was him.

57:29.631 --> 57:33.329
<i>- Hey, could I call you...?
- Caleb, Kate's been attacked.</i>

57:33.502 --> 57:34.662
Wait, wait. What?

57:34.837 --> 57:37.638
They say it's like
she's been bitten by spiders...

57:38.743 --> 57:41.008
...and I had this terrible nightmare
about spiders.

57:42.180 --> 57:45.617
I'm scared, Caleb.
Something weird is happening.

57:45.785 --> 57:48.414
Okay, listen.
I want you to go back to your dorm...

57:48.589 --> 57:50.489
...and wait for me there.

57:50.657 --> 57:53.525
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay.

57:59.671 --> 58:02.036
He's put a spell on Kate.

58:02.339 --> 58:04.398
What are you talking about?
What kind of spell?

58:04.776 --> 58:06.176
Creation.

58:07.781 --> 58:09.271
Spiders.

58:09.448 --> 58:11.814
They're taking her to a hospital
in Gloucester.

58:11.984 --> 58:14.386
Don't do anything
until we know what he wants.

58:14.555 --> 58:15.749
We're talking about Kate!

58:49.430 --> 58:53.061
Come to save Little Miss Muffet,
have we?

58:54.639 --> 58:56.071
Well, you're too late.

58:58.008 --> 58:59.739
A spider came
and sat down beside her...

58:59.913 --> 59:01.745
...and frightened Miss Muffet away.

59:29.481 --> 59:31.473
You hurt Kate, and I'll kill you.

59:31.985 --> 59:33.749
Hurt her?

59:34.888 --> 59:36.516
I only used her to get to you.

59:38.193 --> 59:41.720
It's you that I'm gonna hurt.

59:44.668 --> 59:47.604
And you're just my bait
to get to Caleb.

59:57.117 --> 59:59.278
These are her things.

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:03.117
Why don't you go back to the dorm
and get some sleep?

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:06.387
If I hear anything, I'll call you.

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.023
Hey.

01:01:07.437 --> 01:01:09.203
What's wrong?

01:01:12.345 --> 01:01:14.005
Have you seen Pogue?

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.583
No, but I called him
and told him about Kate.

01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:26.089
Well, how is she?

01:01:26.262 --> 01:01:30.290
Not so good. But they said they'd call
if there are any changes.

01:01:36.408 --> 01:01:38.399
Maybe this is him.

01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:42.242
Pogue's been in an accident.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.922
Stop right there.

01:01:57.868 --> 01:01:59.267
Close the door.

01:02:07.913 --> 01:02:12.477
Let's just keep this between
the Sons of Ipswich.

01:02:17.459 --> 01:02:20.829
Don't hurt her.
She has nothing to do with this.

01:02:20.998 --> 01:02:24.559
Whether she lives or dies
is entirely up to you, my friend.

01:02:29.174 --> 01:02:33.202
You can't imagine what it was like
growing up not knowing what this was.

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:41.820
When I finally found my real father,
he filled in all the missing pieces.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.058
But it was too late. I was hooked.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.061
By then, he was
such a bitter old man...

01:02:54.237 --> 01:03:00.237
Or I should say,
bitter, old, young man.

01:03:00.713 --> 01:03:04.777
- that all he wanted to do
was end the suffering.

01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:06.676
Like all our bloodline before us...

01:03:06.855 --> 01:03:09.346
...he was more than willing
to break the laws...

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:13.519
...of your sacred little club.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.462
So I got him to give me
his share of The Power.

01:03:27.514 --> 01:03:32.975
And he died knowing that his son
was going to get revenge...

01:03:33.153 --> 01:03:34.678
...on your Covenant.

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:37.554
You keep her in that spell,
and she'll die.

01:03:38.395 --> 01:03:39.953
I know.

01:03:40.899 --> 01:03:43.992
What is this all about?
I mean, what do you want?

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.062
Want?

01:03:56.951 --> 01:03:58.282
I'm Chase Collins.

01:04:00.823 --> 01:04:04.224
I have everything
I could possibly want.

01:04:09.232 --> 01:04:11.064
It's what I need.

01:04:13.005 --> 01:04:15.701
More power.

01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:25.580
Tomorrow night, birthday boy...

01:04:26.087 --> 01:04:30.549
...at the exact moment
when you ascend...

01:04:32.963 --> 01:04:35.524
...be at Putnam Barn...

01:04:35.699 --> 01:04:38.464
...where you will
will me your power.

01:04:40.204 --> 01:04:44.539
Do that, and I'll let her live.

01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:52.142
And Pogue, Kate, Reid and Tyler
and your mom...

01:04:52.854 --> 01:04:55.550
...and what's left of the families.

01:04:57.793 --> 01:05:00.318
And don't think I won't kill them.

01:05:02.767 --> 01:05:05.100
It comes natural to me.

01:05:06.039 --> 01:05:10.533
Just ask my adoptive parents.

01:05:11.143 --> 01:05:13.375
You killed that kid at the Dells.

01:05:16.818 --> 01:05:19.581
Well, he caught me
doing a little magic.

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:25.619
At first, he wasn't sure,
but then, well...

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:28.163
...he just wouldn't leave it alone.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.265
So I caught a ride with him
over to the bonfire.

01:05:38.779 --> 01:05:39.904
What are you doing?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.049
Just making sure
I'm making my point.

01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:15.020
Do you see my problem here?

01:06:19.464 --> 01:06:23.229
I like to use. A lot.

01:06:24.569 --> 01:06:26.230
Only...

01:06:26.404 --> 01:06:30.342
...no one ever told me about...

01:06:30.678 --> 01:06:34.944
...the effects and the damage.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.017
The addiction.

01:06:38.487 --> 01:06:40.888
And we both know
what happens, now, don't we?

01:06:42.057 --> 01:06:43.685
So...

01:06:45.496 --> 01:06:47.293
...the way I see it...

01:06:48.132 --> 01:06:50.728
...I add your power
to what I already have.

01:06:51.002 --> 01:06:52.937
It won't stop the aging.

01:06:53.105 --> 01:06:57.008
Your father obviously found out
the hard way.

01:06:59.747 --> 01:07:02.114
My father never had
this kind of power.

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:04.650
It doesn't work like that.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.846
It's the body that wears down,
not the power.

01:07:11.895 --> 01:07:15.993
Just think of yourself
as a sacrificial lamb.

01:07:19.671 --> 01:07:21.333
Hell...

01:07:22.441 --> 01:07:25.239
...you're already their golden boy.

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.978
Why not go out a real hero?

01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:34.150
So tomorrow night, the barn.

01:07:34.323 --> 01:07:36.382
Where it all started.

01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:41.055
A birthday party. Just you and me.

01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:44.161
It's either you...

01:07:45.204 --> 01:07:46.967
...or them...

01:07:50.076 --> 01:07:51.805
...brother.

01:08:02.092 --> 01:08:06.188
Don't leave her like that. She'll die.

01:08:28.991 --> 01:08:30.621
What happened?

01:08:33.497 --> 01:08:36.662
- You passed out when I told you...
- What?

01:08:41.607 --> 01:08:45.135
- Pogue's been in an accident.
- Is he okay?

01:09:02.669 --> 01:09:04.533
Hey, hey, take it easy.

01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:12.571
- What?
- Stay away.

01:09:12.745 --> 01:09:15.408
He's more powerful...

01:09:16.015 --> 01:09:17.676
...than you can imagine.

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:21.216
Hey, don't worry.
Don't worry about that.

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:24.189
We can't stop him.

01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:36.805
- How is he?
- He's hurt pretty bad.

01:09:36.975 --> 01:09:39.171
- Where's Sarah?
- Waiting room.

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:42.876
I say we all go after Chase.
Right now.

01:09:43.618 --> 01:09:45.416
Listen, it may not be that easy.

01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:51.955
You guys stay here with Pogue.
Call me if there's a change.

01:10:00.773 --> 01:10:02.675
How's Pogue?

01:10:05.645 --> 01:10:07.044
He's not good.

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:10.619
What about Kate?
Have you heard anything?

01:10:10.786 --> 01:10:14.153
They stabilized her,
but she's still really sick.

01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:30.569
Caleb, look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.573
The spiders.

01:10:33.749 --> 01:10:37.846
I read about them. They're one
of the charges against John Putnam.

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:44.922
They're some kind of spell,
aren't they?

01:10:52.972 --> 01:10:55.237
I wanna show you something...

01:10:56.443 --> 01:10:58.538
...and then I'll explain everything.

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:24.804
Don't be afraid.

01:11:53.748 --> 01:11:55.979
What about your caretaker?

01:11:59.589 --> 01:12:01.488
It'll be okay.

01:12:37.336 --> 01:12:39.828
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

01:12:40.372 --> 01:12:43.776
- Caleb...
- This is important to me, Gorman.

01:13:04.838 --> 01:13:06.362
It's okay.

01:13:22.361 --> 01:13:27.492
This is William Danvers III,
my father.

01:13:31.137 --> 01:13:33.696
He's 44 years old.

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:55.562
Every generation,
the bloodlines produce only one:

01:13:55.736 --> 01:13:57.795
The eldest male.

01:13:57.972 --> 01:14:00.907
And you've always had this power?

01:14:01.575 --> 01:14:04.739
At 13, you get a taste of it.
It's a test, in a way.

01:14:05.515 --> 01:14:09.884
At 18, we ascend,
and our powers fully mature...

01:14:10.053 --> 01:14:12.521
...and it's seductive.

01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:18.696
And some can handle it,
and others, like my father, couldn't.

01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:26.935
Tonight, at 12 minutes past 11,
I'll ascend.

01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:30.410
And what if you don't
will him your share?

01:14:30.578 --> 01:14:33.139
He's already got his father's.
It makes him very powerful.

01:14:33.315 --> 01:14:35.146
And what if someone wills you
their share?

01:14:35.317 --> 01:14:38.310
It's against the Covenant laws.
If it weren't, I wouldn't let them.

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:40.548
- Why not?
- When one ascends...

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.354
...The Power becomes your life.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:45.960
That's why it ages you.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.999
Will it away, and you die.

01:14:57.644 --> 01:15:00.343
Caleb, you cannot do this alone.
We have to go to the others.

01:15:00.517 --> 01:15:03.817
We can't do that.
He'll kill us all, including you.

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.755
Pogue was the final warning.

01:15:05.923 --> 01:15:07.585
- We have to go to your father.
- No.

01:15:08.193 --> 01:15:11.594
I know what you're thinking, Mother,
and you know what'll happen.

01:15:13.032 --> 01:15:14.465
But he loves you.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:19.931
Well, then, he'll die with that secret.

01:15:26.549 --> 01:15:29.451
- Where's Sarah?
- Upstairs, changing.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.953
- You should never have involved her.
- You're right.

01:15:34.192 --> 01:15:36.456
But I can't change the past...

01:15:36.628 --> 01:15:38.892
...and he's using her against me,
all of you...

01:15:39.799 --> 01:15:41.892
...and it's going to stop.

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.475
I want you to take Sarah
to the dance.

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.948
I'll meet you there. I don't think
he'll try anything in the open.

01:15:53.117 --> 01:15:56.347
Would you just let us help you?
You know we've got your back.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.317
I know you do.

01:15:59.156 --> 01:16:03.219
But please, just once, do what I ask.

01:16:18.012 --> 01:16:19.570
You look beautiful, my dear.

01:16:24.589 --> 01:16:27.218
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:16:35.034 --> 01:16:36.468
<i>Why can't I go with you?</i>

01:16:36.636 --> 01:16:40.165
- I won't risk you.
- I'm scared.

01:16:41.443 --> 01:16:43.105
Don't be.

01:16:44.313 --> 01:16:47.750
- I'll see you soon.
- You better.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.258
I promise.

01:17:18.889 --> 01:17:22.485
Be careful. I'll call you.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:04.373
- Hey, any sign of him?
- No.

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:07.482
<i>Good. Listen, I'm on my way.
If he does show...</i>

01:18:07.651 --> 01:18:09.846
...please promise me you won't
do anything stupid.

01:18:11.422 --> 01:18:14.586
<i>- How's Sarah doing? Can I talk to her?
- Yeah, she's fine. Hang on.</i>

01:18:17.598 --> 01:18:20.760
- She was just here.
- Guys, what's going on?

01:18:27.108 --> 01:18:28.599
Caleb? Caleb?

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.711
What's your plan?
You can't beat me, you know.

01:18:45.631 --> 01:18:46.859
Something's happened.

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:38.259
You know...

01:19:38.698 --> 01:19:40.427
...I'm just getting the feeling that...

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.126
...you're not gonna keep up
your end of the bargain...

01:19:43.305 --> 01:19:45.933
...so I took out
a little insurance policy.

01:19:52.014 --> 01:19:54.140
She does look quite stunning.

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:58.211
You touch her, and she dies.

01:19:59.491 --> 01:20:02.017
In fact, time's running out for Sarah.

01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:04.090
So why don't we
get down to business?

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.911
Witchy.

01:20:20.785 --> 01:20:22.776
Oops, wait.

01:20:22.955 --> 01:20:25.650
Did I just say, "witch"?

01:20:26.593 --> 01:20:31.087
All right. Tell you what.
I'll make this easy for you.

01:20:32.132 --> 01:20:34.259
How about an accident?

01:20:35.068 --> 01:20:39.733
You lose control of your car
on the way to the pathetic little dance.

01:20:39.908 --> 01:20:43.472
Trust me. I'm good at car accidents.

01:20:43.648 --> 01:20:45.638
Everyone'll miss you.

01:20:45.815 --> 01:20:48.284
They'll say great things about you.

01:20:49.353 --> 01:20:51.514
Only the Covenant
will know the real truth.

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:56.491
But, to them,
you'll become a legend.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.462
The one who gave his life for them.

01:21:04.039 --> 01:21:07.532
How about you let her go,
and I let you live out your life?

01:21:08.978 --> 01:21:12.644
How about I make you
my "weyotch"?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:14.448
I'll never will you my power.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:17.985
Then it looks like trouble for Sarah.

01:21:19.024 --> 01:21:20.582
I'll never let that happen.

01:21:20.759 --> 01:21:23.127
Fine. Let's do it your way.

01:21:40.818 --> 01:21:43.447
Like taking candy from a baby.

01:22:30.381 --> 01:22:31.972
Easy as pie.

01:22:44.231 --> 01:22:45.892
- You find her?
- No.

01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:52.367
Twelve minutes past 11.

01:22:52.975 --> 01:22:54.499
Happy birthday, Caleb.

01:23:06.259 --> 01:23:08.284
Are we ascending?

01:23:09.997 --> 01:23:11.589
Finally!

01:23:18.173 --> 01:23:20.802
Scary, huh, Caleb...

01:23:22.146 --> 01:23:25.308
...this new power you get
when you ascend?

01:23:26.516 --> 01:23:30.045
Frankly, I don't think
you're cut out for it.

01:23:32.225 --> 01:23:33.886
So why don't we just call it a night?

01:23:35.495 --> 01:23:37.055
Just say the words.

01:24:01.029 --> 01:24:04.692
Okay, I'm a little impressed.

01:24:04.866 --> 01:24:07.129
- Not bad.
- Thanks.

01:24:20.019 --> 01:24:21.986
Trying to impress your date, huh?

01:25:54.502 --> 01:25:56.164
You ready to say uncle?

01:25:56.638 --> 01:25:58.469
I'm ready for you to go to hell.

01:26:46.369 --> 01:26:48.303
Leave us, Gorman.

01:26:56.613 --> 01:26:57.841
Just say the words.

01:27:00.785 --> 01:27:04.223
Say the words, and it's all over.

01:27:05.726 --> 01:27:07.090
<i>Listen to me, William.</i>

01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:11.699
I need you to understand me.

01:27:18.842 --> 01:27:22.335
Come on! Say it! Say the words!

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.414
"I..."

01:27:26.252 --> 01:27:29.086
- I...
- "...will you..."

01:27:29.823 --> 01:27:32.018
...will you...

01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:36.188
...nothing.

01:27:38.867 --> 01:27:40.858
<i>He is your son.</i>

01:27:41.603 --> 01:27:46.042
For once in your life,
think of someone other than yourself.

01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:53.942
I...

01:27:55.221 --> 01:27:56.415
...will...

01:27:57.958 --> 01:27:59.482
<i>...you...</i>

01:28:00.494 --> 01:28:03.987
<i>...my power.</i>

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:10.865
We searched the entire area.
We didn't find anybody.

01:31:15.405 --> 01:31:16.838
How can that be?

01:31:35.664 --> 01:31:37.530
Where is he?

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:41.765
I don't know.

01:31:42.305 --> 01:31:48.331
