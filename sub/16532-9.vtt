00:00.750 --> 00:01.928
- Come on in.
- Hey-o!

00:01.952 --> 00:03.373
- Hi!
- Hello.

00:03.398 --> 00:05.452
Do you love our sweaters?

00:05.477 --> 00:07.803
I thought they would be
perfect for the Snow Ball dance.

00:07.828 --> 00:09.494
I got them at the store
where you buy things

00:09.563 --> 00:10.796
that go with the other things.

00:10.864 --> 00:12.364
Oh, I know that place.
That's where we got

00:12.433 --> 00:14.514
our Salt-N-Pepa salt and pepper shakers.

00:14.539 --> 00:17.272
Claire can never tell
which one is which.

00:17.297 --> 00:20.069
A confusing idea poorly executed.

00:20.138 --> 00:21.274
Stop implying I'm a racist.

00:21.299 --> 00:23.936
How did we get roped
into this chaperone thing?

00:23.961 --> 00:26.765
This incredibly annoying
PTA mom, Marjorie,

00:26.790 --> 00:28.552
keeps hounding us to
volunteer for things,

00:28.577 --> 00:30.366
- and we finally ran out of excuses.

00:30.391 --> 00:32.128

tell her we're coming.

00:33.244 --> 00:34.262

- [Claire's Cellphone chimes]

00:36.641 --> 00:38.107
"How far away are you?"

00:38.132 --> 00:40.155
- [Gloria's Cellphone chimes]
- "Text me when you're close."

00:40.180 --> 00:42.420
- [Claire's Cellphone chimes]
- "I locked my keys in my car."

00:42.445 --> 00:43.892
Oh, that's from Haley.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.569
Much as I'd love to meet this dingbat,

00:45.594 --> 00:47.686
how many chaperones do they really need?

00:47.788 --> 00:51.006
Takes one person to turn a
garden hose on those dry humpers.

00:51.031 --> 00:52.864
If Phil is going, you are going.

00:52.889 --> 00:56.317
I don't like being the only person
in the room without a husband.

00:56.342 --> 00:57.944
It's my one insecurity.

00:57.969 --> 00:59.331
Phil's just trying to be nice.

00:59.356 --> 01:00.799
He doesn't want to go
to this thing, either.

01:00.824 --> 01:02.303
Actually, I was looking forward to it.

01:02.328 --> 01:04.513
Maybe meet some of these
so-called cheerleaders.

01:04.538 --> 01:06.838
Watch their faces when I tell
them we could kewpie a scorpion

01:06.863 --> 01:09.718
into a cradle catch and then
pop up into a split extension.

01:09.743 --> 01:11.877
[Chuckles] Most of that
stuff's illegal now.

01:11.902 --> 01:14.279
I think what Phil's
trying to say is that

01:14.304 --> 01:17.600
he and I haven't had a
boy's night in a good while.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.751
I mean, wouldn't it be nice
to just hang out together,

01:19.776 --> 01:21.092
just you and me?

01:21.116 --> 01:22.756
What do you say, buddy?

01:23.543 --> 01:25.358
What?!

01:26.288 --> 01:29.638
Might be nice to have
a hang with my boy Jay.

01:29.663 --> 01:31.296
If it's fine with you.

01:31.321 --> 01:33.298
Sure, it's the least I
could do, because tomorrow

01:33.323 --> 01:35.500
you are going to help
Luke with his homework

01:35.525 --> 01:37.303
while I visit wine country.

01:37.328 --> 01:38.814
[Gasps] I want to go.

01:38.839 --> 01:41.606
That's just what she calls lying on
the trampoline drinking Chardonnay.

01:41.631 --> 01:42.631
- Ah.
- [Claire's Cellphone chimes]

01:42.656 --> 01:44.509
Oh, yes! We're on our way.

01:44.534 --> 01:45.575
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.878
- Bye.
- Have fun, you two.

01:46.911 --> 01:48.739
Don't worry about us.
We'll have a blast.

01:48.772 --> 01:50.215
We'll have a good time.
We'll have a good time.

- Yes!

01:52.086 --> 01:54.252
This is gonna be so great!

01:54.277 --> 01:55.520
Sure it will. Maybe give them about

01:55.545 --> 01:58.270
a five-minute lag time
before you hit the road.

01:58.539 --> 01:59.702
What do you mean? You...

01:59.727 --> 02:01.213
you said we were gonna
do something together.

02:01.238 --> 02:03.641
I was just trying to get
us out of that stupid dance.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.961
Oh.

02:05.556 --> 02:07.430
- Okay.
- Enjoy your night, Phil.

02:07.455 --> 02:10.039
I've got a date with an epic
Western about a crooked sheriff,

02:10.328 --> 02:13.663
and I'm at the first of what I
predict to be many wrongful hangings.

02:13.688 --> 02:15.522
Well, if you're not
up for doing anything,

02:15.547 --> 02:17.095
I think I'll just go to the dance.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.869
What? No. You can't do that.

02:18.894 --> 02:20.330

02:22.297 --> 02:24.645
- I want to go to the dance.
- How are you not getting this?

02:24.670 --> 02:27.099
Fine. I'll just go home.

02:27.531 --> 02:28.653
You're going to the dance, aren't you?

02:28.678 --> 02:31.101
- Of course I am.
- All right, you win.

02:31.453 --> 02:33.342
- We'll do something.
- Awesome!

- What do you want to do?
- Gosh, I don't know.

I mean, dancing is
still so much in the air.

07:56.512 --> 07:57.510
[Laughs]

07:57.535 --> 07:59.023
And then you'd bleed to death,

07:59.048 --> 08:00.747
'cause we can't afford a
school nurse anymore, right?

08:00.772 --> 08:02.557
Ooh! Oysters.

08:05.991 --> 08:07.758
Oh! Nice try, boys!

08:08.428 --> 08:10.715
You guys are cool. Just, uh, move along.

08:11.007 --> 08:15.267
Hey, Cam. Uh, do you know
a kid named Damien Warmack?

08:15.299 --> 08:16.312
Oh, yeah.

08:16.337 --> 08:17.469
- Mean little kid.
- Yeah.

08:17.494 --> 08:19.004
He fat shamed my whole defensive line.

08:19.073 --> 08:20.513
There's nothing more sad than watching

08:20.538 --> 08:23.021
a once terrifying nose tackle
pick croutons out of his salad.

08:23.046 --> 08:24.178
Oh, God, I'm so conflicted.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.052
A gay kid is now
bullying football players,

08:26.077 --> 08:27.505
which I guess, you know,
seems like progress,

08:27.530 --> 08:28.958
but the wrong kind of progress.

08:28.983 --> 08:30.630
- Would you like a...
- Oh!

08:33.731 --> 08:37.897
In my defense, bruschetta mostly
ends up on the floor anyway.

08:37.922 --> 08:39.178
Cam, I think you might be

08:39.203 --> 08:40.975
more worried about this
prank than you need to be.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.600
Well, I just don't understand
why they want to prank me.

08:42.625 --> 08:43.756
I thought they liked me.

08:43.782 --> 08:45.011
Of course they like you.

08:45.036 --> 08:46.631
You can't prank someone you don't like.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.389
That's... that's just assault.

08:48.602 --> 08:50.635
But pranking you is their bizarre way

08:50.660 --> 08:51.859
of saying that they love you.

08:51.884 --> 08:55.202
Is this your bizarre way of
not validating my feelings?

08:56.275 --> 08:57.832
Okay, we could go bowling.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.656
Hmm. Had my league last
night. I'm a little bowled out.

09:00.681 --> 09:02.178
Fair enough. Round of mini golf?

09:02.204 --> 09:04.678
Great idea. Wait up. I'll go
get my frog and my slingshot.

09:04.702 --> 09:06.068
We'll hop on our bikes
and go down there.

09:06.137 --> 09:07.846
- We could get something to eat.
- Already ate.

09:08.110 --> 09:09.515
- Go to the movies?
- Hate the lines.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.514
- How about a bar?
- So, we drive across town,

09:11.547 --> 09:13.921
pay a 200% markup on
the same glass of scotch

09:13.946 --> 09:15.570
I'm holding in my hand right now...

09:15.578 --> 09:17.878
just so some drunken old
broad can stagger over

09:17.947 --> 09:19.713
and tell me I look like Ernest Borgnine.

09:19.782 --> 09:22.249
You know what? I'm done trying.

09:22.602 --> 09:24.035
I'm sorry there isn't a single thing

09:24.060 --> 09:25.094
you'd have fun doing with me.

09:25.119 --> 09:26.447
Oh, come on!

09:26.472 --> 09:27.868
Don't get all hurt.

09:27.893 --> 09:30.860
I promise your next
idea, I'll say yes to.

09:33.190 --> 09:35.344
- Really?
- Thanks, Jay.

09:35.369 --> 09:36.845
You held out for something awesome,

09:36.870 --> 09:38.920
and I think we nailed it.

09:42.197 --> 09:43.300
One, please.

09:43.325 --> 09:46.126
That'll be $8, plus whatever
tip you feel is appropriate.

09:46.151 --> 09:48.062
It was free an hour ago.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.387
You used to be able to throw a baby

09:49.412 --> 09:50.761
in the back seat
without strapping it in.

09:50.785 --> 09:52.015
Times change, my friend.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.565
[Sighs]

09:54.414 --> 09:55.713
Hey, Delgado.

09:55.738 --> 09:57.805
I hope this punch isn't as watered down

09:57.830 --> 10:01.609
as your performance in "A Streetcar
Named Desire to Hang Myself."

10:01.634 --> 10:04.509
Damien, you're just... you look...

10:04.534 --> 10:06.458
Damn it, I hate how
much I like that jacket.

10:06.483 --> 10:07.860
[Chuckles]

10:08.203 --> 10:09.402
Hey.

10:09.427 --> 10:11.328
- I know what you're doing.
- Excuse me?

10:11.353 --> 10:13.883
I know how hard it is to be a gay teen.

10:13.985 --> 10:16.619
In high school, I only had one friend.

10:16.687 --> 10:17.686
Really?

10:17.788 --> 10:19.455
What was Oscar Wilde like?

10:19.480 --> 10:20.846
You're lashing out.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.980
Because you're angry
and you're insecure,

10:24.005 --> 10:26.077
and you just want everyone
else to feel as bad as you do.

10:26.172 --> 10:27.505
Maybe.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.340
But come on.

10:29.367 --> 10:32.472
It must've been easier for you
looking like Michael Fassbender.

10:32.497 --> 10:34.798
I do not look like...

10:34.823 --> 10:36.480
You think I look like
Michael Fassbender?

10:36.505 --> 10:38.240
Yeah, if he were older and shorter

10:38.265 --> 10:39.564
and played by Kathy Griffin.

10:39.589 --> 10:40.659
Uh...

10:44.112 --> 10:47.747
Hey, hey. That Damien
Warmack kid is so mean.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.069
Honing in on these
poor kids' insecurities

10:50.094 --> 10:52.077
and then just lacerating them.

10:52.102 --> 10:53.829
I-I don't look like Kathy Griffin, do I?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.253
I'll tell you what's mean,

10:55.278 --> 10:58.588
is my team making me wait
all night for this damn prank.

10:58.846 --> 11:00.174
Or, "Mitch, you're being ridiculous.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.323
"You're a very handsome man,

11:01.348 --> 11:02.417
"and if you had to be played by a woman,

11:02.442 --> 11:03.534
"it would be a young Ann-Margret."

11:03.559 --> 11:04.922
- Hey, Coach.
- Oh, God! Just do it!

11:04.947 --> 11:06.033
Just do it!

11:06.058 --> 11:08.571
Oh, Principal Brown,
sorry. Sorry, I thought...

11:08.925 --> 11:10.346
I thought you were the prank. [Chuckles]

11:10.371 --> 11:12.125
Prank? Oh, no.

11:12.150 --> 11:14.050
That was a little
misunderstanding on my part.

11:14.075 --> 11:16.503
Turns out the new wrestling
coach is being pranked.

11:16.573 --> 11:17.853
Yeah, they're gonna do that thing where

11:17.878 --> 11:19.255
you spin a guy around a bunch of times,

11:19.280 --> 11:20.285
you get him good and dizzy,

11:20.310 --> 11:22.354
and then you tie him to
a tree for the weekend.

11:22.379 --> 11:23.705
Oh, God. Shouldn't you stop them?

11:23.773 --> 11:25.807
I would, but he's been
parking in my spot lately.

11:26.184 --> 11:28.517
I guess it's a relief
they're not pranking me.

11:28.586 --> 11:30.238
Yes. You can finally relax.

11:30.263 --> 11:31.320
Can I?

11:31.544 --> 11:33.344
Knowing Coach Wilson's
only been here seven months?

11:33.369 --> 11:35.211
He's never brought his
team homemade banana loaf,

11:35.236 --> 11:37.148
and yet they care
enough to terrorize him?

11:37.173 --> 11:39.099
Okay, you're gonna have
to land on a position.

11:39.124 --> 11:41.435
I just don't understand why
they begged me to be here

11:41.537 --> 11:42.870
if they're not gonna prank me.

11:42.938 --> 11:44.605
Because they love you,

11:44.630 --> 11:46.573
and you're making a real
difference in their lives.

11:46.811 --> 11:48.021
Oh, well, I-I...

11:48.090 --> 11:49.956
I'm just kidding. They
think you're a pushover,

11:50.025 --> 11:51.458
and with you here, they
can get away with anything.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.424
That's ridiculous, because
nothing gets past me.

11:53.449 --> 11:55.084
Excuse me. Thank you.

11:55.137 --> 11:56.503
- Mm-hmm.
- What is that?

11:56.528 --> 11:57.593
Look at this.

11:57.618 --> 11:58.802
Oh.

12:02.292 --> 12:04.459
I'm gonna go pour this down the drain.

12:04.648 --> 12:06.007
Cheers.

[Laughs]

12:10.210 --> 12:11.454
[Forced chuckling] Having fun?

12:11.479 --> 12:13.929
Hey, I'm just trying
to keep up appearances.

12:13.954 --> 12:16.729
If I panic, everybody panics.

12:16.798 --> 12:18.384
How much money did you
make at the drink station?

12:18.409 --> 12:19.675
Only about $200.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.799
That's enough.

12:21.036 --> 12:22.468
A caddy at the country club where I work

12:22.493 --> 12:23.826
knows this dog track in Hindsdale.

12:24.175 --> 12:26.029
There's 40-to-1 odds on a greyhound,

- Whippet Good, who...

12:28.307 --> 12:30.073
Okay, the money's gone.

12:32.675 --> 12:33.674
One time.

12:33.699 --> 12:35.262
- No, it's stupid.
- Just try it.

12:35.287 --> 12:37.044
- I'm not doing it.
- No one else is around.

12:37.069 --> 12:39.137
- I don't care.

[Singsong voice] Somebody
thinks you're cute.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.230
Claire, please, this isn't high school.

Well, no, wait a minute.
It is high school.

- Mm.
- Okay.

13:03.025 --> 13:04.534
All right, so who is it?

13:05.735 --> 13:09.137
My favorite is a 1929 Bread Master.

13:09.162 --> 13:10.334
Some people might say

13:10.359 --> 13:14.185
that collecting vintage
toasters is a crumby hobby.

[Chuckles]

13:15.745 --> 13:16.911
Thank you.

13:16.936 --> 13:19.861
Marjorie, I was just
talking to Principal Brown,

13:19.886 --> 13:21.653
and he into you, girl.

13:21.721 --> 13:25.056
Really? He's hotter than
a 1930s Sunbeam Toastrite.

I can't talk right now, Mom.

13:30.139 --> 13:33.049
No, I'm not home alone
on a Saturday night.

13:33.074 --> 13:36.512
I'm at a dance, and a boy likes me.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.587
We good at this!

13:38.689 --> 13:40.163
Why are you talking like that?

- I don't know.

13:43.016 --> 13:45.187
I don't know exactly how to do this,

13:45.212 --> 13:47.444
but I'm very flattered
by your interest in me,

13:47.469 --> 13:50.044
and just so you know,
the feeling is mutual.

13:50.069 --> 13:51.099
What?

13:51.124 --> 13:53.078
I don't know if you're into
camping, but I can get a tent.

I'm married. My rear end is at home.

13:55.967 --> 13:57.596
I meant Marjorie.

13:57.934 --> 13:58.900
Oh!

13:58.925 --> 14:01.391
Oh, no. She's way too intense.

14:01.416 --> 14:03.471
No. And once you've imagined yourself

14:03.496 --> 14:05.893
sitting by a campfire playing
your clarinet for Gloria...

14:05.918 --> 14:07.430
Marjorie loves the outdoors.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.956
Yes, she even has a camping toaster.

14:09.981 --> 14:13.937
She is a super lady,
but, guys, I'm only 45.

I'm holding out for fireworks.

14:16.229 --> 14:18.198
Oh, here comes Damien.

Do not tell him that I thought
I had a shot with Gloria.

My mom doesn't believe that
Principal Brown likes me.

- How about ice cream?
- Too cold.

14:34.614 --> 14:35.668
- Coffee?
- Too late.

14:35.693 --> 14:37.403
Oh, wait a minute. I'm such an idiot.

14:37.471 --> 14:39.038
I forgot about the Clint
Eastwood retrospective

14:39.106 --> 14:40.272
followed by the scotch tasting

14:40.341 --> 14:41.907
where famous athletes
from the '70s tell stories

14:41.976 --> 14:43.556
about how life used to be in Youngstown.

14:43.581 --> 14:44.654
- Really?
- No!

14:44.937 --> 14:46.212
It doesn't exist.

14:46.237 --> 14:47.971
What you want does not exist.

14:48.006 --> 14:49.539
What are you doing?

14:49.608 --> 14:51.228
I don't care what you do,

14:51.406 --> 14:52.829
but I'm going into that dance.

14:52.940 --> 14:54.874
I like to see the kids
all dressed up and happy

14:54.899 --> 14:56.740
and trying to look older than they are.

14:56.765 --> 14:59.615
The first girl I ever kissed
was at a high school dance.

14:59.914 --> 15:01.155
Huh.

15:01.180 --> 15:03.179
It was actually to "The
Lion Sleeps Tonight."

15:03.248 --> 15:04.874
I guess that's why it was in my head.

15:04.899 --> 15:08.719
Let's just say the lion
did not sleep that night.

15:09.523 --> 15:11.490
I was slamming Mountain
Dews like a wild man.

15:11.515 --> 15:13.739
Marsha Goulding.

15:13.764 --> 15:15.417
I had this huge crush on her.

15:15.486 --> 15:18.348
Finally got my nerve up to
ask her to the Spring Fling.

15:18.373 --> 15:21.264
First dance, I was terrified.
I'm tromping all over her feet.

15:21.289 --> 15:23.256
But as the dances
went on, it got easier,

15:23.324 --> 15:26.992
and right in the middle of Sam
Cooke singing "You Send Me,"

15:27.061 --> 15:28.660
I went for it.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.895
I was just so surprised
she kissed me back.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.864
[Chuckles]

15:32.966 --> 15:35.934
Well, you can't have
your first kiss again,

15:35.969 --> 15:37.889
but you can have your
next one right in there.

15:38.109 --> 15:39.465
Oh, what the hell. Give Gloria a thrill.

15:39.534 --> 15:41.365
That's great, Jay,
'cause you complete her.

15:41.390 --> 15:43.717
- Oh, Phil.
- No, literally.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.572
You complete her.

15:45.674 --> 15:47.015

- You're the butt of this joke.

15:50.095 --> 15:51.728
Give me the sweater.

15:52.078 --> 15:54.657
Marjorie is smart and organized,

15:54.690 --> 15:56.517
and if you ever need hand
sanitizer or a Band-Aid,

15:56.542 --> 15:57.671
she always has it on her.

15:57.696 --> 16:00.396
She's like a sexy, sexy drugstore.

16:00.421 --> 16:01.890
She's as cute as a button.

16:01.915 --> 16:04.123
Like a grown-up Cabbage Patch doll.

16:04.148 --> 16:05.614
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that seems like

16:05.639 --> 16:07.177
it'd be a whole lot of e-mails.

16:07.202 --> 16:08.301
It's a hard pass.

16:08.326 --> 16:09.969
But, Principal Brown,
you know what they say

16:09.994 --> 16:12.782
about a mom who's
enthusiastic in the streets.

16:12.807 --> 16:14.422
That's not a saying.

16:14.447 --> 16:17.176
Why are the two of you suddenly so
interested in my love life, anyway?

16:17.201 --> 16:18.664
Because we care.

16:18.689 --> 16:19.979
You don't even know my first name.

16:20.081 --> 16:21.219
Yes, we do.

16:21.244 --> 16:23.716
It's, um... Prince?

16:24.662 --> 16:26.041
Lucky guess.

16:26.143 --> 16:27.676
I was over at the carving station,

16:27.745 --> 16:30.841
and I thought, "You know
who'd love some prime rib?

16:30.974 --> 16:32.456
"Principal Prince Brown."

16:32.481 --> 16:33.738
- Oh.
- [Both chuckles]

16:33.763 --> 16:35.169
[Clears throat] Marjorie, I'm afraid

16:35.194 --> 16:37.771
you and I are pawns in a very sick game

16:37.797 --> 16:39.464
being orchestrated by these two.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.098
They're working very
hard to put us together,

16:41.123 --> 16:42.333
and I don't know why.

16:42.576 --> 16:45.275
I've never seen them work
very hard in anything,

16:45.300 --> 16:46.689
except getting out of volunteering.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.939
Hey, to be fair, we volunteer
for plenty of things.

16:49.964 --> 16:53.564
Yeah, don't you remember me
holding a hose at the car wash?

16:53.589 --> 16:55.814
Yeah, everybody remembers that.

16:55.839 --> 16:57.681
So you're not interested in me?

16:57.868 --> 16:59.820
Well, we've always had
a working relationship,

16:59.913 --> 17:02.800
and I guess I've just never
thought of you in that way.

17:02.825 --> 17:03.957
As a woman?

17:04.055 --> 17:07.356
When I'm at work, I turn
off that part of myself.

17:07.459 --> 17:08.790
Oh.

17:08.893 --> 17:10.126
Oh.

17:10.555 --> 17:13.313
Uh, it has turned back on.

17:13.338 --> 17:14.205
[Both chuckle]

17:14.231 --> 17:15.305
- Okay.
- Oh.

17:15.329 --> 17:17.422
Oh, I'm gonna check
the... the fire exits.

17:17.446 --> 17:18.994
We're going to stack chairs.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.307
Whatever.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.242
I've got it.

17:22.310 --> 17:23.544
We start a fake marching band

17:23.646 --> 17:25.244
and get the money for
the instruments up front.

17:25.314 --> 17:27.545
You just described the exact
plot of "The Music Man."

17:27.569 --> 17:29.683
- How'd that turn out?
- Won four Tonys.

17:29.914 --> 17:31.981
Five. Ugh.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.082
How could you let this happen?

17:33.184 --> 17:34.617
I don't know. You were texting me

17:34.642 --> 17:37.004
while I was live streaming
my breakfast, and...

17:37.175 --> 17:38.283
Wait a minute.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.681
I did say $800.

17:39.706 --> 17:40.823
Look.

17:40.892 --> 17:42.931
Oh, my God, this is all my fault.

17:42.956 --> 17:44.283
Well, well, well.

17:44.409 --> 17:47.393
Looks like the dunce
cap is on the other foot.

17:48.558 --> 17:49.574
Hey!

17:49.599 --> 17:52.542
Is what an animal your size grazes on.

17:52.567 --> 17:53.850
Hay is...

17:53.952 --> 17:55.085
You're a cow.

17:55.264 --> 17:56.363
[Chuckles]

17:56.388 --> 17:57.614
Okay.

17:58.639 --> 18:01.153
You're the perfect
weight for your frame.

18:04.972 --> 18:05.905
Hey.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.806
Another proud moment for the struggle.

18:07.831 --> 18:09.483
Ugh. Here she comes.

18:09.508 --> 18:11.578
Martin Luther Queen, yes.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.724
By all means, tell
me about the struggle.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.360
Okay, you nasty little twink.

18:16.526 --> 18:17.878
You owe everything to me

18:17.903 --> 18:19.605
and all the gays that came before you.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.329
It's because of everything we fought for

18:21.354 --> 18:23.054
that you get to snark your
way through high school

18:23.079 --> 18:24.478
with lifts in your shoes

18:24.503 --> 18:27.924
instead of spending it
terrified, shoved in a locker.

18:27.949 --> 18:29.850
I was really proud of that.

18:30.634 --> 18:31.608
Wow.

18:32.318 --> 18:34.124
Just so you know.

18:34.624 --> 18:36.858
Exfoliating with a dry brush pre-shower

18:36.883 --> 18:39.150
will really help you with all of this.

18:39.231 --> 18:41.279
It'll make you look 50 again.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.510
I'm not really proud of what came next.

18:44.535 --> 18:46.035
[Grunting]

18:46.060 --> 18:48.260
Damien: You shove like a girl!

18:48.629 --> 18:49.761
What are you doing?

18:49.786 --> 18:50.985
The piper needs to be paid.

18:51.177 --> 18:52.443
You hired a piper?

18:52.468 --> 18:56.136
No. I made a mistake, and I
need to accept the consequences.

18:56.592 --> 18:57.791
[Clears throat]

18:57.816 --> 19:01.017
Classmates, could I have
everyone's attention, please?

19:01.042 --> 19:02.842
I have some troubling news.

19:02.867 --> 19:05.468
I know you may all think
of me as the golden boy,

19:05.493 --> 19:07.743
the prodigy, the wunderkind.

19:07.768 --> 19:08.834
Who are you?

19:08.859 --> 19:09.958
Indeed.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.382
I'm not sure I know anymore.

19:11.890 --> 19:13.446
We have a little situation,

19:13.470 --> 19:15.036
and I just want to be
as up front as I can.

19:15.138 --> 19:16.438
Hold on a minute.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.539
I'm the President.

19:17.564 --> 19:18.963
I should do this.

19:19.134 --> 19:23.398
We need to raise $8,000
for a classmate in need.

19:23.546 --> 19:26.604
If we don't get this money,
he may never walk again.

19:26.673 --> 19:29.107
We're gonna make a Kickstarter,
and if you want to show

19:29.132 --> 19:31.232
your date you're the kind
of sensitive, caring person

19:31.257 --> 19:33.708
who deserves to be
rewarded in a physical way,

19:34.162 --> 19:35.780
you'll give generously.

19:37.250 --> 19:38.716
Wow, you're a good liar.

19:39.070 --> 19:41.847
I take it back. You
deserve to be President.

19:43.314 --> 19:44.647
We never should've
helped that little punk

19:44.672 --> 19:46.038
get out of that locker.

19:46.063 --> 19:49.121
I didn't know he was gonna be
so brutal about your sweater.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.901
- [Inhaling]
- All right, hand it over.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.984
- What?
- This is a blaze-free zone, wastoid.

19:55.249 --> 19:56.751
I got eyes all over this place.

19:56.785 --> 19:57.893
I know what vape is.

19:57.918 --> 19:59.393
- Coach, that's just my...
- Just your...

19:59.418 --> 20:01.151
Hey, Coach, can I talk
to you for a second?

20:01.508 --> 20:02.473
Yeah, what's up?

20:02.498 --> 20:03.690
Yeah, I, uh, just wanted to let you know

20:03.715 --> 20:05.115
that that's, uh... that's his inhaler.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.367
It's his... oh.

20:06.436 --> 20:07.535
What is wrong with you?

20:07.560 --> 20:08.859
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

20:08.884 --> 20:10.484
It's just... I give
everything to these boys,

20:10.550 --> 20:12.167
and all they think of
me is that I'm a pushover

20:12.192 --> 20:13.979
not even worthy of a lousy prank.

20:14.187 --> 20:15.609
Cam, have you seen Gloria?

20:15.634 --> 20:17.632
What? Yeah, oh, last time I saw her,

20:17.658 --> 20:19.251
she was somewhere over here.

20:19.837 --> 20:21.203
[Gasping]

20:21.915 --> 20:23.472
Oh, that was for me!

20:23.497 --> 20:26.265
That was supposed to be
for me! My boys love me!

20:30.754 --> 20:32.787
I just wanted to read my book.

20:34.323 --> 20:36.115
Oh, hi there. I'm Luke Dunphy,

20:36.140 --> 20:37.591
Student Body President.

20:37.616 --> 20:39.287
- And I'm Manny...
- But this isn't about us.

20:39.312 --> 20:41.654
We have a classmate who's
in a pretty bad spot.

20:41.679 --> 20:43.521
[Monitor flatlines]

20:43.546 --> 20:44.990
But it doesn't have to end that way.

20:45.015 --> 20:48.044
With your help, we can save
him from getting beaten up.

20:48.069 --> 20:49.394
By... by his disease.

20:49.419 --> 20:52.253
A disease no kid should
have to wrestle with.

20:52.858 --> 20:55.056
We just need to raise $8,000 to...

20:55.158 --> 20:57.659
Or $9,000 to get him that
super deluxe treatment.

20:57.761 --> 20:58.765
We only need $8,000...

20:58.790 --> 21:01.476
I'm Luke Dunphy, and
I approve this message.

21:01.531 --> 21:02.764
