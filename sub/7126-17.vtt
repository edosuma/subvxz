What happens when you achieve your dream
running a multi-million dollar charity foundation, 

00:05.960 --> 00:07.870
but you have no idea what to do?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.070
You're like a dog who chases cars and finally catches one.

00:11.190 --> 00:11.970
Now what?

00:12.110 --> 00:15.040
I guess you chew on the tire
for a while until you figure it out.

00:16.930 --> 00:20.520
Tyler Banks, your temp, but I
can see this becoming permanent.

00:20.650 --> 00:22.030
Oh, well, it's nice to meet you, Tyler.

00:22.180 --> 00:24.470
And I... I didn't know what you liked, so I got you all of them.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.730
Oh, okay, thank you.

00:26.180 --> 00:28.550
My, um, office?

00:29.070 --> 00:30.380
Is this okay?

00:51.830 --> 00:53.280
I see a bookshelf right there.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.130
It's okay.

00:54.260 --> 00:56.750
I do the same thing every time I take over a company.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.890
Sorry, Sam, this guy just walked right by me.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.470
He does not have an appointment.

01:02.620 --> 01:03.350
Winston...

01:03.480 --> 01:04.319
Funk.

01:04.450 --> 01:05.540
Name on the building.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.210
Tyler Banks... name on the yogurt in the fridge.

01:09.410 --> 01:10.600
Tyler.

01:12.480 --> 01:13.690
So...

01:13.830 --> 01:15.310
welcome to your company.

01:15.570 --> 01:18.790
Listten, we have a lot to talk about.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.810
How about scheduling something for, ooh, next week?

01:21.930 --> 01:24.160
Okay, um, how about lunch on Monday?

01:24.280 --> 01:26.420
No, I meant all next week.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.560
Jackson Hole has 3 feet of powder.

01:28.690 --> 01:30.560
Oh, you know, as tempting as that sounds, 

01:30.690 --> 01:34.000
I do have $30 million of your money burning a hole in my pocket, 

01:34.250 --> 01:35.700
and it ain't gonna spend itself.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.800
Well, as long as you're giving all ofy money away, 

01:37.930 --> 01:39.780
we might as well give some of it to the Ritz-Carlton.

01:39.910 --> 01:40.690
Oh, you go.

01:40.830 --> 01:42.580
I need to find needy people.

01:42.930 --> 01:43.890
I have needs.

01:44.030 --> 01:45.620
You can pay people to take care of those.

01:45.750 --> 01:46.490
Thought I had.

01:46.620 --> 01:47.410
Now it's $40 million.

01:47.530 --> 01:48.420
Keep talking.

01:48.580 --> 01:49.910
Okay, Sam, I get it.

01:50.040 --> 01:50.820
You won.

01:50.960 --> 01:51.690
You got the job.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.930
Now I need to get down to business and find our first charity.

01:55.050 --> 01:55.890
Fantastic.

01:56.030 --> 01:56.980
I mean, you're so eager.

01:57.110 --> 01:58.670
Why don't we call a press conference for next Friday?

01:58.790 --> 01:59.820
I don't even need that much time.

01:59.930 --> 02:00.660
How about this Friday?

02:00.790 --> 02:01.360
How about Thursday?

02:01.490 --> 02:02.080
How about Wednesday?

02:02.250 --> 02:03.900
Because today is Wednesday.

02:04.060 --> 02:05.240
How about Thursday?

02:11.470 --> 02:12.890
I'm sorry. They just showed up.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.840
It might be the free money.

02:15.140 --> 02:18.130
I believe we said next Friday, right?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.210
Come on, Andrea.

02:27.350 --> 02:28.490
Let me be in your wedding.

02:28.620 --> 02:30.560
I mean, all the celebrities are gonna be there, 

02:30.700 --> 02:33.450
and... and I've never got to be a bridesmaid before.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.150
I mean, the closesthing that I ever
got was I was my mother's pallbearer.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.010
Well, I would give it some thought, 

02:39.120 --> 02:45.240
but I have so many errands to run, and
I just don't have time to think about it.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.760
I'll do it.

02:46.900 --> 02:47.880
I get it. I get it.

02:48.020 --> 02:48.860
I'll do it. I'll do it.

02:50.470 --> 02:51.700
Hey, I'm sorry.

02:51.990 --> 02:52.940
Oh, where have you been?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.210
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.220
I know, I know... 

02:55.350 --> 02:58.380
I had a 5:00 with a land mine victim that ran over.

02:58.530 --> 02:59.530
I told him I had to run.

02:59.660 --> 03:00.840
I felt bad about that.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.290
Then I apologized for blowing him off.

03:03.430 --> 03:04.710
Yeah, that went well.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.130
You want to hear a really sad story?

03:06.250 --> 03:09.390
They discontinued the bridesmaid dresses that I wanted.

03:09.530 --> 03:10.850
Here's what we're left with.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I couldn't possibly look at this... oh, God. These are bad.

03:14.130 --> 03:14.760
I know.

03:14.910 --> 03:18.880
Well, it's the whole point... to make
you look like a clown, so I can shine.

03:19.340 --> 03:20.570
Just not the corduroy.

03:20.710 --> 03:23.730
Well, you will make a lovely southern Belle.

03:23.940 --> 03:25.610
It's endless, I'm telling you.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.960
If I say yes to one charity, I'm just
saying no to thousands of other ones.

03:29.110 --> 03:31.380
It... it's like I'm responsible for the entire world.

03:31.530 --> 03:33.960
I do not want to decide who lives or who dies.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.730
You know, I'm not Santa Claus.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.900
Oh, uh, remember, we talked about that?

03:39.030 --> 03:40.240
It's this new you.

03:40.360 --> 03:42.230
You're too soft, say no.

03:42.380 --> 03:43.070
Yeah.

03:43.210 --> 03:46.270
What I need is the old me to come
help the new me with this job.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.330
Yeah, and the closest thing
you have to the old you is me.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.520
Oh, my God, you're right.

03:53.740 --> 04:00.860
I hate disappointing the less fortunate,
and you seem to get a thrill out of it.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.350
Are you offering me a job?

04:03.530 --> 04:04.440
Yes.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.620
Oh, come on, please do it.

04:05.770 --> 04:06.570
I'm really afraid.

04:06.690 --> 04:07.950
I can't do this alone.

04:08.090 --> 04:08.940
What does it pay?

04:09.080 --> 04:10.510
I don't know. I looked at the budget really quickly.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.290
I... I think there's a seven in it.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.890
I won't do it for anything less than a nine.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.310
I can do an eight, but that's it.

04:15.450 --> 04:16.550
Yeah.
Yes!

04:16.700 --> 04:17.480
Oh, thank you.

04:17.630 --> 04:21.870
Um, about this hummingbird choir, you... 
you do know that they don't really hum?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.260
I want birds, and I want "we've only just begun."

04:24.390 --> 04:25.960
You want to be a bridesmaid, figure it out.

04:26.110 --> 04:27.040
Okay!

04:28.810 --> 04:30.150
Hey, Andrea... 

04:30.600 --> 04:31.130
I'm sorry.

04:31.310 --> 04:32.340
I didn't know you were in a meeting.

04:32.470 --> 04:33.040
No, no, no.

04:33.170 --> 04:33.990
Come in, come in, come in.

04:34.110 --> 04:35.170
Sam, meet Philippe.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.640
We've been going over his ideas all morning, 

04:37.770 --> 04:39.280
and we really need your opinion on this.

04:39.420 --> 04:40.930
Great. Fire away.

04:43.290 --> 04:44.100
What do you think?

04:44.230 --> 04:46.660
He did J.Lo's first and third wedding.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.410
I'm sorry, Philippe. I really need to talk to Andrea, 

04:49.560 --> 04:52.750
so if you'll just step out for a minute, that would be great.

04:52.890 --> 04:53.970
Au revoir.

04:54.630 --> 04:57.990
Andrea, honey, we have a press conference on Friday.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.310
Oh, my God.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.950
Yeah, I know, that's what I'm saying.

05:01.070 --> 05:03.580
Tony Dane and I have a press conference in an hour.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.150
Thank you so much for reminding me.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.130
What?

05:06.310 --> 05:07.510
You cannot go.

05:07.650 --> 05:09.200
It is so good to work for a friend.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.760
Chapman was such a slave driver.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.190
I'll be back at 4:30.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.840
Ooh, that's really not enough time to start anything.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.310
Oh, we'll hit it hard tomorrow morning.

05:16.430 --> 05:16.950
Andrea!

05:17.070 --> 05:19.700
Wha... Andrea!

05:21.440 --> 05:22.260
Hi, Cheryl.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.560
I'm Samantha Newly.

05:23.870 --> 05:27.140
Oh, okay, this isn't a proposal. It's a... resume.

05:27.270 --> 05:27.890
Yes.

05:28.030 --> 05:29.730
I saw your press announcement for the foundation, 

05:29.860 --> 05:32.210
and I was betting that you could use an in-house attorney.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.480
Cheryl, I'm so sorry, but we have already filled that

05:34.680 --> 05:37.840
Oh, wow, you've... you've worked for a lot of foundations, huh?

05:37.960 --> 05:40.640
And it looks like you have a lot of
grant applicants out there already.

05:40.820 --> 05:42.830
Oh, God. Yes, I am so overwhelmed.

05:42.950 --> 05:46.480
I just... 
Ms. Newly, you really need to narrow your focus.

05:46.620 --> 05:47.930
What is your mission statement?

05:48.610 --> 05:49.640
My mission statement.

05:49.770 --> 05:51.390
Um, well...

05:51.630 --> 05:56.530
it is to boldly go where, 

05:57.100 --> 06:00.850
no man has gone... yeah, okay, so I don't
really know what a mission statement is.

06:00.970 --> 06:03.940
What your foundation does and doesn't stand for.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.800
Oh, good.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.270
Evil...

06:07.410 --> 06:08.500
in that order.

06:08.620 --> 06:12.620
You'll find a lot of these guys are just hustlers
trying to take advantage of the new kid.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.660
The charity business is about knowing the
players, and believe me, I know all of them.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.030
And I can help you sort these out in a couple of days.

06:19.150 --> 06:20.470
Do you have any questions for me?

06:20.610 --> 06:23.080
Um, yeah, just a couple.

06:23.220 --> 06:24.440
Are you getting married?

06:24.580 --> 06:25.690
Never again.

06:25.870 --> 06:27.720
And when can you start?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.740
Hey, what's going on?

06:31.850 --> 06:35.620
What's going on is we need a new fridge.

06:35.740 --> 06:38.410
Well, you don't throw something out every time it breaks.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.530
If we did that, how would we play our 8-tracks?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.380
I can fix this puppy.

06:43.510 --> 06:45.840
Not this time. I made sure of that.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.080
Hey, dad, you're a boss.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.860
Have you ever had to fire a friend?

06:50.580 --> 06:51.780
Howard, tell her.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.590
You're not my friend. You're my wife.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.190
It was when we were first married.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.350
He was tryinto save money... surprise, surprise.

06:57.630 --> 07:00.780
Well, you're still married, so it must've gone okay, right?

07:00.930 --> 07:03.160
I had to have security escort her from the building.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.640
I lost two good men that day.

07:04.790 --> 07:05.800
I have Tyler.

07:05.930 --> 07:08.050
I guess this would give him a chance to die for me.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.130
Ah, I found it.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.090
Look.

07:11.150 --> 07:13.980
It looks like that wire's been cut.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.420
Beavers.

07:17.990 --> 07:20.320
I'll just tell Andrea it's the economy.

07:20.460 --> 07:21.910
You know, I'm downsizing.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.610
She'll understand that, right?

07:23.730 --> 07:26.750
I mean, it's like, if we were friends and I fired you... you did...

07:26.870 --> 07:28.290
from our relationship.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.310
I was downsizing.

07:29.460 --> 07:31.820
You see how much better that sounds?

07:38.390 --> 07:40.840
Do you still have thatook of Shakespeare
sonnets that I gave you for your birthday, 

07:40.970 --> 07:42.650
the one that you pretended to like?

07:42.780 --> 07:43.750
Oh, I loved it.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.640
Yes, it occupies a place of honor on, 

07:47.730 --> 07:49.320
over there somewhere.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.150
Great. Now I'm going to go fire Andrea.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.540
Oh, have fun. Yeah.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.880
Keep her in front of you.

07:55.110 --> 07:56.550
Yeah.
Okay.

08:00.020 --> 08:03.540
Just pitching some spec vows to Andrea, you know.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.000
Still not a bridesmaid, but it's a foot in the door, right?

08:08.220 --> 08:09.510
Oh, here it is.

08:10.530 --> 08:11.440
Sorry.

08:20.940 --> 08:22.190
Oh, the ring.

08:22.410 --> 08:25.080
Oh, are you... are you gonna propose to Sam?

08:25.230 --> 08:26.280
Can you keep a secret?

08:26.410 --> 08:27.170
No.

08:27.370 --> 08:30.920
Before the accident, I proposed to her.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.799
But you can't tell her.

08:34.850 --> 08:38.390
You know, um, are you gonna propose to Sam again?

08:39.140 --> 08:40.760
No, that's over.

08:41.510 --> 08:47.700
I've been wanting to get a place of my
own, so if I hock this, I can afford it.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.190
No. No, no, no, no.

08:49.310 --> 08:51.390
No, you're giving up too soon.

08:51.540 --> 08:52.130
Oh, God.

08:52.350 --> 08:57.560
Haven't you pictured your lives,
you know, growing old together?

08:57.690 --> 08:58.430
Yeah, I did once.

08:58.550 --> 08:59.330
Well, do it again!

08:59.470 --> 09:02.310
Hey, hey, you know, they have computer software that'll, 

09:02.450 --> 09:06.950
you know, age you, and you can see
what you... you guys would look like, 

09:07.070 --> 09:08.300
or, hey, just get a mirror.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.200
Just get a mirror and kinda... kinda pull down like...

09:11.330 --> 09:13.020
I love you, Todd.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.350
I love you, Todd Deepler!

09:20.430 --> 09:24.200
Andrea, you may have noticed a downturn in the economy and

09:24.360 --> 09:26.640
Now you listen to me, lard ass...

09:26.840 --> 09:27.840
I'm on the phone with Chapman.

09:27.980 --> 09:28.700
What? No!

09:28.840 --> 09:29.600
No, no, no, no, no.

09:29.710 --> 09:30.320
Don't do that.

09:30.460 --> 09:34.470
No... you can take your job and
stick it somewhere the sun... hello?

09:34.600 --> 09:37.500
What... 
I needed it for my phone cord collection.

09:37.650 --> 09:38.960
Stupid hobby.

09:40.110 --> 09:40.760
Oh, God.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.470
Um, wait right here.

09:42.590 --> 09:44.140
I'll be right back. Just...

09:44.280 --> 09:46.830
this completes my set, so...

09:49.260 --> 09:51.900
Hey, girlfriend, it's 8:00.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.990
Didn't you, uh, get my e-mail about coming at 10:00, huh?

09:54.100 --> 09:55.570
Oh, I'm sorry, that's my worst fault.

09:55.690 --> 09:57.910
I'm the last one to leave, and I'm two hours early.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.990
Who's that in my office?

09:59.190 --> 10:00.580
Well, aren't you just Miss Nosey Parker?

10:00.690 --> 10:01.620
Maybe I have a surprise for you.

10:01.740 --> 10:02.830
Now you're ruining it!

10:05.670 --> 10:06.970
Who are you talking to?

10:07.530 --> 10:08.670
The ceiling guy.

10:08.950 --> 10:09.840
Where is he?

10:10.030 --> 10:11.880
In the... ceiling?

10:12.010 --> 10:12.920
Were you not listening?

10:13.040 --> 10:14.320
Do I have to fire you for that?

10:14.450 --> 10:15.620
What's going on?

10:15.760 --> 10:18.830
Well, maybe I was gonna surprise
you, Andrea, but now you're ruining it.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.390
Who's that?

10:20.940 --> 10:25.520
I'm Cheryl Hainstock, vice president of legal affairs.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.470
Surprise.

10:31.570 --> 10:34.250
It works a lot better when she jumps out of the cake.

10:36.150 --> 10:37.000
I am so sorry.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.080
It's just that Cheryl is just so much better than you are.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.310
Uh, that sounded bad.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.640
It's not personal, okay?

10:42.780 --> 10:44.110
It's just business.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.890
But you know what?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.770
In the business of friendship, you're still hired.

10:48.900 --> 10:49.830
You know what? I get it.

10:49.960 --> 10:50.730
I get it. Stop it.

10:50.870 --> 10:53.100
Come here, come here...
What?

10:53.990 --> 10:55.110
Oh, my God, thank you.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.270
Thank you for making this so easy.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.730
Wow, so...

11:00.230 --> 11:02.670
Well, are you just gonna go back to your old job, missy?

11:03.210 --> 11:05.770
Oh, yeah, you're gonna say to Chapman, "I'm sorry.

11:05.890 --> 11:09.590
my bad," and he's gonna be like, "you're in
the doghouse, Belladonna." And, you know... 

11:09.750 --> 11:10.510
Yeah.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.880
I'm not going anywhere.

11:12.020 --> 11:12.840
I'm sorry?

11:13.370 --> 11:15.520
Oh, you see, I signed a contract.

11:15.650 --> 11:18.600
So you can keep her, but I'm staying.

11:18.890 --> 11:21.390
And do what?

11:21.520 --> 11:24.360
Just... just act like nothing's changed?

11:24.500 --> 11:25.940
Oh, no, one thing has changed.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.490
You're not my maid of honor anymore.

11:27.640 --> 11:29.010
It's not personal.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.650
It's just business, missy.

11:32.160 --> 11:32.940
Right.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.160
No, I get it.

11:35.730 --> 11:37.850
So where's my maid of honor?

11:39.410 --> 11:41.590
I love this dress!

11:42.840 --> 11:45.270
I mean, I don't really love, you know, this dress.

11:45.410 --> 11:46.160
Who could?

11:46.310 --> 11:48.210
But I love that I've been asked to wear it.

11:49.050 --> 11:50.600
Well, hi, y'all.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.180
Oh, sam, I don't want any trouble.

11:54.330 --> 11:55.580
What are you doing here?

11:55.730 --> 11:57.010
Well, fiddle-dee-dee.

11:57.140 --> 11:59.570
I'm here for my maid of honor fittin', sugar.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.460
Dena is my maid of honor now, honey pie.

12:02.620 --> 12:03.350
See, she's wearing the hat.

12:03.470 --> 12:04.720
She's wearing the maid of honor hat.

12:04.860 --> 12:06.380
I am wearing the hat, Sam.

12:06.640 --> 12:12.110
Yes, well, you asked me to be your
maid of honor, and guess what?

12:12.370 --> 12:13.820
I'm not going anywhere.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.920
Now let's talk bridal shower.

12:17.100 --> 12:23.200
I was thinking maybe some sloppes,
some ribs or maybe a dancing bear.

12:23.330 --> 12:24.970
You don't have to rassle it.

12:25.110 --> 12:26.920
That's okay. That's Dena's job now.

12:27.060 --> 12:28.070
I have to wrestle a bear?

12:28.180 --> 12:29.460
What is the theme of this wedding?

12:29.620 --> 12:32.000
Oh, also, my maid of honor speech.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:33.130 --> 12:34.460
No one said I had to make a speech.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.280
I was thinking about starting off with a dirty limerick...

12:38.490 --> 12:40.180
in a wee irish brogue.

12:40.310 --> 12:41.610
I can't... I can't talk in public.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.640
I... I freeze up, and I swallow air.

12:43.770 --> 12:45.310
I cannot believe you're doing this to me.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.290
You started it.

12:46.420 --> 12:49.550
You lured me into a job, and then you fired me.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.220
You took advantage of our friendship.

12:52.350 --> 12:56.030
I blew off a fake job to go and plan my wedding.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.060
Big whoop.

12:57.190 --> 12:58.080
A fake job?

12:58.280 --> 13:00.400
You got hired to do a job that you know nothing about

13:00.520 --> 13:03.170
because the boss wants to get into your pants.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.270
It's a joke.

13:04.410 --> 13:04.960
Oh, yeah?

13:05.080 --> 13:06.610
You want to know what a joke is?

13:06.730 --> 13:09.730
Marrying a gay guy and thinking it's an actual wedding.

13:09.850 --> 13:10.390
You know what?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.800
It's so funny, people are laughing behind your back.

13:12.930 --> 13:15.730
Oh, like they're laughing at you at Chapman & Funk?

13:15.870 --> 13:20.250
I wouldn't know, because the laughing that
they're laughing at you is drowning it out!

13:20.400 --> 13:22.100
But possibly!

13:23.060 --> 13:24.030
A joke!

13:24.150 --> 13:28.210
I can start with a joke and use my little
hand puppet, little Dena, and, you know, '

13:28.320 --> 13:30.860
cause she has the courage to say things I don't.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.200
Hell everyone.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.060
Has, uh, that one been in yet?

13:39.180 --> 13:42.780
She got a 911 text from an ice sculptor and flew outta here.

13:42.920 --> 13:43.750
Oh, good.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.630
Then we can get some work done.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.150
Almost done already.

13:47.330 --> 13:51.620
I divided the proposs into yeses, maybes and nos.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.840
There's only one pile.

13:52.970 --> 13:54.190
Those are the nos.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.160
Well, why even do the maybes, then?

13:57.300 --> 13:58.720
I'm an optimist.

14:01.230 --> 14:03.300
You rejected the red cross?

14:03.440 --> 14:04.710
Showboaters.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.110
"We're the red cross.

14:06.310 --> 14:09.620
We save victims of war and disasters."

14:10.250 --> 14:17.230
Um, cheryl, I, uh, know we haven't quite
pinned down the mission statement yet, 

14:17.350 --> 14:21.420
but the gist of it is we give money away.

14:21.540 --> 14:23.670
And that's what they want... handouts.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.520
I could use a million dollars. Maybe I'll apply.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.760
I worked my tailbone off for every penny I ever got.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.910
Nobody ever gave me a free ride.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.300
That's nuts.

14:37.050 --> 14:40.920
Cheryl, have you noticed a downturn in the economy?

14:41.080 --> 14:41.970
I'm not going anywhere.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.900
I signed a contract, too.

14:45.900 --> 14:46.770
Dad?

14:47.710 --> 14:48.300
What?

14:48.520 --> 14:50.330
Oh, it's you. I'm sorry.

14:50.660 --> 14:51.830
Whole neighborhood's out.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.510
Yeah, I saw that.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.590
So what were the "beavers" trying to get this time?

14:56.750 --> 15:00.520
One of those fancy washer/dryers that talk to each other.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.930
All I did was yank a couple of wires, 

15:03.070 --> 15:07.680
and now mr. Mcclatchey's respirator is running off his car battery.

15:07.820 --> 15:11.740
The abernathy kid picked the wrong day to
bring the incubator chicks home from school.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.550
The high school hockey game...

15:14.730 --> 15:16.590
let's just say we've had a day.

15:16.890 --> 15:18.280
You want some chardonnay?

15:18.850 --> 15:20.750
It's warm, but it does the job.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.210
Dad?

15:25.970 --> 15:26.620
Hey, sweetie.

15:26.750 --> 15:27.940
How's the boss?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.060
I suck.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.860
I have two lawyers.

15:31.010 --> 15:32.570
I have a thousand applicants.

15:32.710 --> 15:36.440
And I have 2 days to start giving away $30 million.

15:36.580 --> 15:39.530
There's nothing but problems.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.750
Could you... could you hold that for a second?

15:43.180 --> 15:44.910
Now that, that's a problem, okay?

15:45.060 --> 15:48.120
What you have is a job, a job that you always wanted.

15:48.260 --> 15:49.230
You just shocked me.

15:49.370 --> 15:52.570
Well, so you stumble a little bit out of the gate. Who cares?

15:54.490 --> 15:57.010
Do you think I knew what I was doing when I started out?

15:57.300 --> 16:00.250
I mean, it's not that I'm bad at it. It's just...

16:00.740 --> 16:03.720
the truth is, dad, I don't deserve it.

16:03.840 --> 16:04.570
Andrea's right.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.720
It's just a joke job...

16:06.880 --> 16:11.720
and the only reason I have it is because
some billionaire wants to get into my pant... 

16:11.850 --> 16:13.430
tomine club.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.220
It's a very exclusive club.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.640
Here's a secret.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.550
Everyone is a fraud.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.560
Nobody knows what they're doing.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.370
I mean, do you think I have any idea
how to fix this electrical panel?

16:25.470 --> 16:27.500
But I am not letting your mother win.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.080
That is not an option.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.350
Okay.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.050
I get it.

16:32.580 --> 16:33.750
I just gotta do it.

16:35.330 --> 16:37.920
It gets easier, though, doesn't it, daddy?

16:38.290 --> 16:39.930
Boy, wouldn't that be great?

16:40.270 --> 16:43.720
You know, for every problem you solve, you create three more.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.220
You know, and then you... you hire a staff.

16:46.390 --> 16:48.420
And then the staff has kids.

16:48.570 --> 16:53.100
Now they all want to take the afternoons off so
that they can take their kids trick-or-treating.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.760
I mean, since when did Halloween become a holiday, huh?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.250
Daddy.

16:58.020 --> 17:01.210
But, hey, it's gonna be great for you, okay?

17:01.370 --> 17:02.220
Okay.

17:02.460 --> 17:08.099
For me, you know, I think I've had a good run.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.450
What?

17:09.579 --> 17:10.970
You're quitting?

17:11.119 --> 17:12.079
Yeah.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.310
Thanks for the talk, kiddo.

17:15.819 --> 17:17.140
Hey, Regina...

17:17.270 --> 17:20.089
we have to talk about the rest of our lives.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.960
What have you done to your father?

17:32.640 --> 17:33.600
Good morning, Tyler.

17:33.730 --> 17:35.960
Will you grab all the proposals and bring them into my office?

17:36.090 --> 17:37.720
And hold all my calls.

17:37.870 --> 17:39.330
I love your sense of purpose.

17:39.470 --> 17:41.620
And your... bouncy ringlets.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.830
prenatal care would cost so little, 

17:56.980 --> 18:00.600
and the effect on infant mortality would be enormous.

18:03.380 --> 18:06.030
it shouldn't be that easy to end up in the street.

18:06.180 --> 18:07.330
It should be hard.

18:09.090 --> 18:17.500
God asks us to save his children, not to prove
we're virtuous, but to fill our hearts with joy.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.030
What's this?

18:48.390 --> 18:49.910
It's my resignation.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.370
I was wrong.

18:51.660 --> 18:52.670
You're not a joke.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.980
You ever wonder why we're friends?

18:56.270 --> 18:57.110
No.

18:57.240 --> 19:02.570
Because the truth is, I have no idea what I'm doing.

19:02.830 --> 19:05.400
And you were the only person who would tell me that.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.860
And I think it's because you and I will tell each
other the things that other people won't.

19:08.990 --> 19:10.030
Or should.

19:10.170 --> 19:11.600
I mean, like you and your wedding.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.560
Who else is gonna say to you, "Andrea, stop.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.180
What's up with the gay dude?"

19:16.300 --> 19:17.570
No one.

19:18.030 --> 19:21.630
But seriously, the guy is, like, super gay.

19:21.750 --> 19:22.840
I know.

19:22.990 --> 19:23.820
I know.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.610
Okay, fine, look.

19:28.510 --> 19:34.660
When I was 6, I would play dream
wedding like every little girl would do.

19:34.820 --> 19:36.620
And my cat would be the ring bearer.

19:36.750 --> 19:42.010
And I'd wear this big dress, and... and I'd
have a big pink cake, and there'd be birds.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.200
And then when I got older, then I'd play divorce attorney.

19:46.340 --> 19:48.840
And now the guys that I date... I don't wanna marry them.

19:48.960 --> 19:53.280
And if I did, I'd run off to Vegas or
a courthouse or something, but...

19:53.440 --> 19:56.750
the little 6-year-old still wants that day.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.190
You wanna take that dream away from a little girl?

20:00.350 --> 20:01.430
Nope.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.390
You know that the cats would eat the birds, right?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.370
So what do you wanna do?

20:09.690 --> 20:14.270
I want you and I to learn this job together.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.040
And I want you to get rid of the crazy lady.

20:17.240 --> 20:17.990
Done.

20:18.140 --> 20:19.440
I already have a plan.

20:19.590 --> 20:20.660
Do I want to hear it?

20:20.810 --> 20:21.630
I don't know.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.820
Can you lie to a grand jury?

20:24.460 --> 20:25.160
Go.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.370
With my amnesia, I can't dream about things
I don't remember, so I dream about the future.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.170
Some people don't even want to wake from their old dreams.

20:43.100 --> 20:46.000
Some just need to make new ones.

20:49.180 --> 20:53.890
Me... for now, I have my hands full just living this one...

20:59.200 --> 21:00.010
Hey, you.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.880
Until the next one comes along.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
