00:14.681 --> 00:16.516
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.310
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.520
Pretty cool, right?

00:21.229 --> 00:22.105
Walk with me.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.567
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:25.650 --> 00:29.487
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:29.571 --> 00:32.198
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.825
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.536
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:36.619 --> 00:37.495
I don't care.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.997
Look at my birds.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.709
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:42.792 --> 00:46.254
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:46.337 --> 00:48.673
I got land, I got animals,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.426
and best of all, I have this.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.970
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:54.471 --> 00:58.892
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.770
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.896 --> 01:06.274
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:06.357 --> 01:07.901
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.984 --> 01:10.403
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.864 --> 01:15.825
So I got a call to be on a TV show
'cause I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.161
I said, "Sure, cool." Why not, right?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.287
So I agreed.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.956
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.957
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.375
<i>-Hi!</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.376
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:26.294
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.504
What do you want?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.380
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:35.053
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:35.136 --> 01:38.515
Because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.432
Say hi, guys.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.391
-Howdy!
-Hello.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.478
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.688
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.732
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.443
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.403
This is Graz.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.405
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.782
And Canadian Pat.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.369
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.453
Let's have fun.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.417
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.170
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains can come up with.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.175
-Wow.
So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.052
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.222
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it. If not…

02:19.305 --> 02:20.265
Next!

02:20.348 --> 02:21.516
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:21.599 --> 02:23.143
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936
-Some builds will be good.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.855
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.439
Are you not entertained?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.108
Some builds will be bad.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.443
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.570
Make a bigger handle!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.655
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.907
-Yeah!
<i>-That is disgusting.</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Whoa!

02:41.411 --> 02:44.622
<i>-I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.875
-Go, Graz!

02:46.958 --> 02:49.878
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun.
-I'm not having fun!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.717
We're gonna show these kids,
if they can dream it up…

02:55.800 --> 02:58.803
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.013
You're onto something there.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.681
…it can be built.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.017
<i>Oh!</i>

03:04.100 --> 03:05.685
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.770
Hey. It might even
inspire them to build

03:07.854 --> 03:09.939
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.816
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:13.484 --> 03:14.319
Not really.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.571
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.781
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work.</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:20.909
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.162
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.079
Whatever.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.637
-Letting your hair out?
-If you got it, flaunt it.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.389
-I had some flow for a while.
-No. Did you really?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.975
Me too. Then God wanted it back.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.478
He took it.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.146
Hey, you know what time it is?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.648
Ponytail time.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.858
-That looks adorable.
-Right? Boom.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.860
-All day you're gonna wear that?
-Yeah.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.862
-Yeah.
-There's a sight for sore eyes.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.447
-Hey, guys.
-What's up?

03:59.530 --> 04:00.907
-You guys know Justine?
-Yeah.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.283
-What's goin' on?
-How's it going?

04:02.367 --> 04:06.162
I called her in to help us to alleviate
the pain I feel working with you guys.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.748
Let's be honest, this show
could use somebody without a beard.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.583
It'll be a whole new show.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.837
<i>On tonight's episode of</i>
The Real Makers of DiResta County,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.881
<i>Jimmy brings another maker into the barn,</i>

04:16.965 --> 04:21.552
<i>Justine Silva,</i>
<i>known for her artsy eye and crafty ways.</i>

04:21.636 --> 04:25.473
<i>Her talent is just as boundless</i>
<i>as it is beardless.</i>

04:25.556 --> 04:28.434
<i>She even does things like this.</i>

04:29.018 --> 04:31.354
<i>But how will the other guys</i>
<i>in the group accept her?</i>

04:31.437 --> 04:33.690
I'm super-excited to be here.
It sounds like a lot of fun.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.943
<i> Whoa!</i>
<i>Does Justine actually mean that?</i>

04:37.026 --> 04:41.030
<i>Or is she here to take Derek's place</i>
<i>as Jimmy's new best friend?</i>

04:41.114 --> 04:42.699
-Oh, boy.
<i> Probably not.</i>

04:42.782 --> 04:45.368
<i>But anything can happen with editing.</i>

04:45.451 --> 04:46.577
Please stop.

04:48.496 --> 04:52.125
<i> Will sassy map-man Jackman</i>
<i>see Justine as a threat?</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:53.876
-What's 9 times 6?
54.

04:54.627 --> 04:58.131
<i> As things heat up, will Graz</i>
<i>hide behind his DeNiro impression?</i>

04:58.214 --> 04:59.048
Little bit.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.051
<i> Nothing is certain,</i>
<i>but one thing is for sure.</i>

05:02.135 --> 05:04.387
<i>No one is safe.</i>

05:04.470 --> 05:08.683
<i>Justine might be here to make things,</i>
<i>but the one thing she's not here to make?</i>

05:08.766 --> 05:09.726
<i>Friends.</i>

05:09.809 --> 05:14.188
<i>Anything goes on tonight's</i>
The Real Makers of DiResta County.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.566
-All right. Good. I'm in.
-We're good.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.694
Justine, are you ready to hear some of
the stupidest ideas you've ever heard?

05:19.777 --> 05:21.988
-Yes.
-All right. Get in positions. Come on.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.240
All right. Bring up the first victim.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.785
Oh my God! Amazing! We got a special
guest appearance from Jonah Hill.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.370
-How are you, Jonah?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.830
<i>-Wonderful.</i>

05:30.913 --> 05:33.082
-I like this kid already.
-Me too.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.668
He just slapped himself.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.546
-What's your name?
<i>-My name is Abraham.</i>

05:38.629 --> 05:39.964
<i>-Leah!</i>

05:40.048 --> 05:41.799
Abraham and Leah?

05:41.883 --> 05:42.717
<i>Yes.</i>

05:42.800 --> 05:44.552
He's gonna smash his head.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.930
Abe, be careful. We don't want
your brains to leak out of your ear.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.559
<i>-What brains?</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:55.355
All right, guys, you got my interest.
What's the idea?

05:55.438 --> 05:57.523
<i>-A pirate ship.</i>
-Okay.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.361
-<i>That could drive on land.</i>
-A pirate ship that drives on land?

06:01.444 --> 06:03.529
-<i>Yes.</i>
-So a pirate car?

06:04.113 --> 06:06.115
What about a pirate ship?
What do you want?

06:06.199 --> 06:09.452
<i>I drew a picture</i>
<i>of what it should look like.</i>

06:09.535 --> 06:12.663
You drew that up?
Did you hold the pencil with your foot?

06:14.374 --> 06:16.250
Abe, describe the photo for me.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.377
<i>Okay.</i>

06:17.460 --> 06:20.421
<i>Here's an important detail of the ship.</i>

06:20.505 --> 06:23.633
<i>It needs cool-y designed windows.</i>

06:23.716 --> 06:25.885
Cool-y designed windows. Okay.

06:25.968 --> 06:30.556
<i>Right here, you have three flags.</i>

06:30.640 --> 06:32.642
<i>Three flags right there.</i>

06:32.725 --> 06:35.478
Abe, I hate to break it to you,
that's four fingers.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.815
<i>No. You must be blind 'cause of old age.</i>

06:38.898 --> 06:41.192
-These guys are funny.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.946
<i>This flag right here is a dart board.</i>

06:45.029 --> 06:45.863
Okay.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.574
-<i>The next flag…</i>
I can't imagine where this is going.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.786
<i>…is a slice of pizza.</i>

06:51.869 --> 06:56.499
<i>And the final flag… is a pizza.</i>

06:58.292 --> 07:00.837
I never would have guessed
this kid was gonna say food.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.673
<i>Also, it needs cannons.</i>

07:03.756 --> 07:04.590
Okay.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.802
<i>But not ordinary cannons.</i>

07:07.885 --> 07:12.432
<i>The cannons shoot… Drumroll please.</i>

07:15.560 --> 07:16.602
<i>pizza.</i>

07:16.686 --> 07:18.187
I knew he was gonna say that.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.398
-The cannons shoot pizza.
-<i>Yes.</i>

07:20.481 --> 07:25.069
<i>So it's basically like weaponizing pizza,</i>
<i>although delicious.</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:30.658
<i>But the cannons</i>
<i>shoot the pizza at the ship.</i>

07:32.118 --> 07:34.704
<i>-Ow.</i>

07:34.787 --> 07:36.998
What if we make one cannon
that shoots salad?

07:37.081 --> 07:39.333
<i>-Who eats salad?</i>

07:39.417 --> 07:41.294
-Definitely not you two.
-<i>Wait. Why are--</i>

07:41.377 --> 07:43.337
<i>Hey. Can you put some of these up here?</i>

07:43.421 --> 07:44.255
What is that?

07:44.338 --> 07:47.425
<i>She asked if you can put</i>
<i>some of "deez" up here.</i>

07:47.508 --> 07:49.719
-What? "Deez" what?
<i>-Deez nu--</i>

07:55.516 --> 07:56.601
These kids are seven.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.478
These kids we should have
on every episode.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.687
Justine, this never happens.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.523
We're never that interested in
the first pitch, but these kids are gold.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.650
-Yeah.
-I like it a lot. I'm in.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.694
I don't care about the idea.
I wanna work with them.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.696
Yeah. If we agree to this,
it's a huge build.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.615
I'll say yes to anything these kids pitch.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.741
Yeah. All right.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.909
Abe, Leah.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.162
Good news.
We're gonna build your pirate ship.

08:16.245 --> 08:20.500
<i>-Yes! Yeah!</i>
<i>-Yeah!</i>

08:20.583 --> 08:22.084
Does that mean he's excited?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.128
All right. I think this meeting is over.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.255
We're gonna get to building.
We'll check in later.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.632
-<i>Okay.</i>

08:28.132 --> 08:29.967
-Wow.
-God bless the mother.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.928
-Justine, you're a good luck charm.
-I love them.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.347
Let's draw this thing up,
figure out how to build it.

08:42.605 --> 08:43.731
So we need to make--

08:49.278 --> 08:52.698
We need to make a pirate ship
that has to ride on the land.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.244
First thing we need is
something that's gonna make this mobile.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.830
I got a buddy with a junkyard. I like
the idea of using an old beat-up car.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.165
-Something small.
-Yeah.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.668
Second thing
we're gonna need is a pirate boat.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.086
Put a big mast in the middle.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.421
-A couple of sails.
-They said something about windows?

09:07.505 --> 09:10.007
What if we did stained glass
for the windows?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.509
We could CNC up a frame.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.511
-Yeah. We can have fun there.
-Yeah.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.346
We need a big log to make the cannon.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.432
A regular cannon is round,
but they wanna shoot flat pizzas.

09:18.516 --> 09:22.186
Right, so if we take a cannon,
but it's elongated,

09:22.687 --> 09:25.523
the pizza would be like that.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.441
Arrr! <i>Feed the fish.</i>

09:27.525 --> 09:29.360
<i>Shiver me timbers!</i>

09:32.989 --> 09:35.074
-I see it already.
-Can I make the cannon?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.951
Please, Jimmy. I wanna make the cannon.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.328
The cannon, Jimmy.
Jimmy, the cannon. Please.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.830
-Jimmy!

09:44.208 --> 09:45.876
Pat, you make the cannon.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.171
-This thing is gonna be huge.
-It'll be like, what? 12, 15 feet long.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.299
-Is everybody up for the challenge?
-Yeah.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.551
-Let's kill it.
-It's gonna be good.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.510
Let's get materials.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.054
Sailors on board!

09:57.138 --> 09:58.389
I gotta learn French.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.891
<i> All hands on deck!</i>

10:05.605 --> 10:07.815
<i>♪ What finer have you seen?</i>

10:19.994 --> 10:21.412
Look at that booty.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.748
-Oh, this must be Jimmy.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.051
-Don't break it!
-Don't break the car!

10:35.134 --> 10:37.303
I hope it's good enough
for a boat.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.430
At least it came with an engine.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.981
So I'm thinking,
we just give this a cut down here.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.900
Go across here. See what's going on.

10:50.983 --> 10:54.445
Leave the main structure just to see.
We don't wanna cut too much too fast.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.906
Do you have a drill?
Give me a little starter hole?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.200
-Maybe something right here.
-Move your hands.

11:03.079 --> 11:03.913
There you go.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.624
What day do you talk to your therapist?

11:07.208 --> 11:10.336
-Mondays at 7:00.
-You might wanna call them today.

11:10.836 --> 11:13.255
Right now,
Derek and I have the easy job

11:13.339 --> 11:15.341
of cutting away the roof of the car.

11:15.424 --> 11:19.845
But the question is, how much needs
to remain for us to build off of?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.972
Because there's not exactly a playbook

11:22.056 --> 11:24.558
for building a pizza pirate ship
that drives on land,

11:24.642 --> 11:26.686
I won't know until I know.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.021
This is good because now we make a deck,

11:29.105 --> 11:31.357
a poop deck,
people can stand up through it.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.525
Yeah.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.236
I just wanted to leave this
'cause I'm concerned about the structure.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.155
If we cut this,
we might end up folding the car in half.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.448
That would be kinda funny.

11:39.532 --> 11:43.327
I mean, we could cut the whole
top off and just weld in supports.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.330
Yeah. It'd be nice
to get this out of here, just because…

11:46.414 --> 11:49.083
-It doesn't give us the room I thought.
-Yeah.

11:49.625 --> 11:53.254
By welding in parallel steel
supports where the doors used to be,

11:53.337 --> 11:56.507
the car should be stable enough for us
to remove the upper part of the frame.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.717
-Go!
-Yeah.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.511
That will help us
clear way for the deck,

12:00.594 --> 12:02.972
which Justine and Graz are designing now.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.432
We got a lot of work to do.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.433
A lot of work.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.643
-Do you feel comfortable drawing?
-Not at all.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.853
All right. I'll do that.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.605
-So we're gonna start with a car, right?
-Yep.

12:12.523 --> 12:16.193
And then we're gonna kinda build a deck
right across this line.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.362
-Top comes right off.
-This goes away.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.948
First, we gotta figure out
what we're gonna use for this deck

12:21.031 --> 12:22.575
'cause that's the main structure.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.368
-Yeah.
-I'm thinking 2x6s?

12:24.452 --> 12:25.453
Yeah. That works.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.413
It'll make it nice and strong.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.250
So it'll hold all of us.
That's a lot of… a lot of weight there.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.671
-Am I crazy, or is it 80% beard weight?
-This thing is pretty heavy.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.507
-I've been having neck issues.
-You're gonna get neck issues.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.508
Gotta get you a brace.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.844
But it's nice because
I off balance it with my ponytail.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.429
Is that why that thing is there?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.431
-Yes.
-It can't be for looks.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.728
-That was mean.
-I'm sorry. I am really sorry.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.731
Probably get one right here, Jimmy.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.609
Derek and I
have begun framing up the frame.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.027
That doesn't sound right.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.654
How about making the ship's frame
for the car frame?

13:00.738 --> 13:03.157
Never mind, it's pointless
trying to make sense of any of this.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.409
Perfect. I can see it already.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.204
Regardless, we're gonna use
2x6 wooden boards

13:08.287 --> 13:11.582
screwed to the car as a frame
that will become the floor of the ship.

13:11.665 --> 13:13.709
Start going this way,
now we go up that way.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.090
Nice.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.426
Now this is gonna be…

13:23.844 --> 13:24.678
the frontal.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.932
We're gonna leave it long.
We'll cut it shorter, but hold that.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.684
-Okay.
-Show you a tricky-poo.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.313
<i>It's time for Jimmy's</i>
<i>"Tricky-poo" of the day.</i>

13:34.396 --> 13:36.774
<i>Yay, Jimmy. Show us a trick, Jimmy.</i>

13:37.274 --> 13:39.485
We're gonna go to the middle and go there.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.446
So I'm gonna use
my fulcrum of my arm to do that.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.114
Gonna do that.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.409
-I'll show you a trick on the band saw.
-I love tricks.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.869
Tricky-poo. Bandsaw.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.331
We're gonna cut a curved bumper
for the front of our ship.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.917
Here's a little trick
to help save some lumber.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.628
Instead of cutting out a solid bumper
from one giant piece of lumber,

13:57.711 --> 13:59.880
we're going to use
this single piece of 2x6

13:59.964 --> 14:02.132
to cut an arc
from one end to the other end

14:02.216 --> 14:04.552
and then reattach
the two pieces back to front,

14:04.635 --> 14:07.930
wasting no wood
and making a nice, even-width bumper.

14:08.013 --> 14:08.889
Stand it up.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.850
Now it's a curved piece of wood.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.226
Boom! Tricky-poo.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.603
-Let's put it as the nose of the boat.
-Nice trick.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.772
<i>Tricky-poo of the day.</i>

14:16.856 --> 14:20.317
-We'll never know that trick.
-I'll have to watch the episode.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.320
-Hey, let's screw that together.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.489
-Well, that's fun.
-That's one nice trick.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.534
So this is gonna kind of go here.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.078
-Like that.
-Wow.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.038
-And I see the boat.
-It's like magic.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.046
We're gonna connect it
to the frame, so it's temporary.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.592
Once the bow is attached,
we'll have the basic outline of the boat.

14:44.675 --> 14:47.428
We can start building
our foundation from there.

14:47.511 --> 14:48.721
You see what I'm talking about?

14:48.804 --> 14:51.265
We want the structure now,
then we go back in and secure it.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.819
Starting to look like an old boat.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.029
Yeah. It is.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.157
-Open the door.
-You guys need a hand?

15:09.450 --> 15:10.993
-Be careful. Be careful.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.703
Don't break the door.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.873
-What do you guys got there?
-It's a cannon.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.499
Oh, okay.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.793
-Nice toothpick.
-Where did you get this?

15:19.877 --> 15:22.880
A lot happened. So let me
give you a little fast-talking flashback.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.132
-We found a tree for the mast.
-This is straight.

15:25.215 --> 15:28.218
I chopped it down.
Pat did some yodeling.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.012
-That was nice. Beautiful.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.681
We stumbled across this beautiful log.
That's a beautiful log.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.767
I thought we could
blast pizzas out of this.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.894
It was big, so Pat cut off the end.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.520
<i>Voila.</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:41.231
It was still too big.
We had to figure out how to drag it.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.359
How do we drag this?
Luckily, we had this chain.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.653
-So we hooked it up to the ATV.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.072
Pat tried to ride the log.
It didn't go great.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.406
You all right? He was fine.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.326
I dragged it out of the woods,
and we rolled it up here to the workshop.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.289
So now we need to install it on the lathe,
so I can turn it into a cannon.

15:58.040 --> 15:58.916
Good luck.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.501
-Hey, Jimmy.
-Yeah.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.461
We have an engine hoist, right?

16:02.544 --> 16:03.629
We do. Yeah.

16:05.881 --> 16:06.715
Okay.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.386
Whoo-hoo.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.055
Wait. Jimmy, shouldn't I be doing that?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.932
-What? This?
-I'm the jack man.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.685
-Jack man.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.144
You got me on that one.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.896
-Ready, jack man?
-I'm ready.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.025
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.069
-More?
-Wait. I gotta…

16:29.071 --> 16:31.156
This is it. If you pull this off…

16:32.157 --> 16:33.242
Wow.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.952
Impressive, guys.

16:35.035 --> 16:39.039
In woodworking, moving a giant log
on a giant lathe is bragging rights.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.462
It's pretty unusual
to cut something this big on the lathe,

16:45.546 --> 16:47.798
but I'm pretty unusual myself.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.511
A surface this rough,
spinning at 500 rotations per minute

16:52.594 --> 16:54.138
can quickly get dangerous.

16:54.221 --> 16:57.433
So first, we get it ready
by stripping the bark.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.605
Then we use the angle grinder
to shed even more weight

17:03.689 --> 17:06.650
and balance the log out,
so it can be ready to spin.

17:07.401 --> 17:11.280
Soon enough, this bumpy log
will be smooth and ready to move.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.450
And also delicious.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.412
It's coming together.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.081
Do you think
we should add one more brace here?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.751
Yeah. Might as well.

17:24.793 --> 17:27.296
The framework
of our pirate ship is nearly done.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.841
This is the supporting structure
that everything gets attached to.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.968
So we need it to be strong and sturdy.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.136
That was way off.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.679
Nice job, Graz.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.890
Well, the rest of the crew
is hard at work,

17:37.973 --> 17:40.392
and we are as focused
as pirates on shore leave.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.393
It feels solid.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.730
That ain't going nowhere.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.024
All right.
Should we start making a deck?

17:47.107 --> 17:48.317
Let's start decking it.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.943
To build a deck,

17:50.027 --> 17:53.864
Graz and Justine are going to attach
2x6 floorboards across the surface.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.533
-Good? One down. 
-One down.

17:56.617 --> 18:00.454
The deck is the floor of the ship,
where the pirates can stand around

18:00.537 --> 18:04.458
and do all their "shiver me timbers"
and all that "yarrr" stuff.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.378
-I think it looks good.
-I would be a proud pirate.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.256
Meanwhile, Derek and I
are going to attach the siding.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.385
We'll be using long pieces of plywood
and form them one by one,

18:15.469 --> 18:16.512
going up the ship.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.056
-I'm making them seven inches wide.
-Okay.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.641
I'm overlapping them one inch.

18:22.309 --> 18:26.396
For the bow, which means the front part
of the boat in sailing mumbo-jumbo,

18:26.480 --> 18:28.899
we're gonna use curved planks
to accommodate the boat shape.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.275
See if this fits.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.777
Yeah. That's good there.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.782
Oop, we broke it.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.910
We'll just rip it off.
I'll just score it so that it bends.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.538
Scoring is another word
for cutting relief cuts

18:42.621 --> 18:44.790
halfway through the thickness
of the plywood,

18:44.873 --> 18:47.626
which allows it to be bendy
and take the shape of the boat.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.629
The boat has a lot of compound curves.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.299
By putting these relief cuts,
we can wrap around that compound surface.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.518
All right. It looks good.
I'm a little concerned about the weight,

19:04.601 --> 19:06.311
but there's not much
we can do about it now.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.606
How much weight do you think we'd lose
if we cut off Graz's ponytail?

19:10.107 --> 19:10.941
Three ounces?

19:11.024 --> 19:13.527
-We could cut it off and weigh it.
-No.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.904
Jackman, how much
do you think this car can hold?

19:15.988 --> 19:19.366
2006 Ford Focus can hold 950.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.450
Rated.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.953
-That's what it's rated for?
-Yeah. The payload capacity.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.163
That's like you and Pat.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.583
-Why didn't you tell us that this morning?
-I did. You didn't listen.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.461
-Did you really look it up?
-And here's another flashback.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.798
Jimmy found the perfect car,
but it had rats.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.216
It's got a rat's nest in here.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.676
It smelled funny.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.761
-Jimmy told me to hop in.
-Hop in.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.430
I hopped in, found a surprise.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.849
-The manual is in the glove box.
-It still has the manual.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.976
-Payload, 950.
-Let me see this.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.855
-Wait. We need--
-See this? We need that.

19:49.938 --> 19:53.275
We're way over, but we don't
have to drive it to California.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.319
We have to drive it around my backyard.

19:55.402 --> 19:59.489
I'd say this, potentially,
is a real piece of ship.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.579
-Thank you.

20:05.662 --> 20:06.538
Ow.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.750
I wanna get started
on the stained glass if we could move it.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.709
Let's turn it around.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.795
<i>This week on</i>
The Real Makers of DiResta County,

20:13.879 --> 20:15.005
<i>we're shipping out.</i>

20:15.088 --> 20:16.965
<i>Things get turned up to a ten.</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:17.925
Is it this loud?

20:18.008 --> 20:20.427
<i> Deckhand Graz</i>
<i>is ship driving blind.</i>

20:20.510 --> 20:21.929
Pat, I can't really see you.

20:22.012 --> 20:24.223
-Back up.
-You act like it's an aircraft carrier.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.391
<i> Is the crew</i>
<i>losing confidence in Graz?</i>

20:26.475 --> 20:27.351
Don't do that.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.938
<i>And is Graz steering the ship</i>
<i>toward his own greed?</i>

20:31.772 --> 20:34.524
We could rent this out
for like proms and stuff.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.738
<i> And is Jimmy</i>
<i>being made a fool?</i>

20:43.825 --> 20:46.495
<i>Find out on</i>
The Real Makers of DiResta County.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.704
<i>We're shipping out.</i>

20:47.788 --> 20:49.039
I believe it's seaworthy.

20:49.122 --> 20:49.957
Catch me.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.709
Oh, you're so sweaty. Oh, gross.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.378
Oh, hey. Watch your hands.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.171
Get your hands off my booty.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.024
Don't get me wrong. I like pineapple.
Just not on pizza.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.069
So, normally
I would order like a pineapple pizza,

21:19.152 --> 21:22.864
put the pineapple aside, eat the pizza,
and then finish with the pineapple.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.117
-That's delicious.
-It's strange.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.035
I'm gonna get the slingshot working.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.079
You finish up
the cannon part of the cannon.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.706
Yeah. I still have a ton of work to do.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.833
-Get that turned down to shape.
-Yep.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.293
Then we'll combine them together,

21:34.376 --> 21:37.087
and we'll have a kinda stretched out,
elongated cannon.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.255
Cool. Okay.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.632
What exactly
is a stretched out, elongated cannon?

21:40.716 --> 21:41.758
Here's what I'm thinking.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.220
Pat's taking the huge log
that we found in the woods

21:45.304 --> 21:47.973
and is spinning it on the lathe
to create the cannon body.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.184
After he's done, we'll slice
down the middle and hollow it out.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.645
We'll take my pizza-shooting
slingshot contraption,

21:53.729 --> 21:55.689
which will look like a big coin slot,

21:55.772 --> 21:58.191
and attach the two cannon halves
on either side.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.652
So from the side,
it'll look just like a cannon,

22:00.736 --> 22:03.697
but from the top,
it's gonna be more of a weird oval shape.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.742
I'm responsible for the pizza part
of the pizza cannon.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.037
I'm gonna start by creating two thin boxes

22:10.120 --> 22:12.372
that are designed
to withhold a bunch of tension.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.875
In this case,
the tension of the slingshot mechanism.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.419
These are also known as torsion boxes.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.883
Then I'll cut out
a circular plate to hold the pizza,

22:22.966 --> 22:25.927
and add a dowel rod in the center
that I'll feed surgical tubing through.

22:26.011 --> 22:30.015
Surgical tubing is incredibly elastic,
but it's also resilient and won't break.

22:30.098 --> 22:33.143
That tubing will then get attached
to the front two sides of the boxes.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.312
Later, I'll install
a metal latch onto the disk

22:35.395 --> 22:38.607
that will grab onto the dowel
until we're ready to fire the slingshot.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.234
Then you'll see
the best pizza slinging you've ever seen.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.444
Hey, Pat.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.487
Huh?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.322
Come check out my pizza cannon.

22:46.031 --> 22:46.990
Oh wow.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.910
-It's a slingshot without your cannon.
-Yeah.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.620
-Try it?
-Yeah, I want to try it.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.746
-Go to that end.
-Yep.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.374
-Gotta hold that against your stomach.
-Yep.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.125
And then pull this back.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.590
-Fire the pizza!
-Okay.

23:06.551 --> 23:09.096
-I got it!
-Oh! It works!

23:09.179 --> 23:10.764
Fire in the hole!

23:17.604 --> 23:21.233
The best part is these little clamps here
that I have on the surgical tubing.

23:21.316 --> 23:23.777
If I move them in further,
we get more tension.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.529
So more force when we throw the pizza.

23:34.121 --> 23:37.958
Justine and I designed some
window frames and cut them out on the CNC.

23:39.042 --> 23:40.752
This is probably upside down.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.005
And once Jimmy
figures out how they're gonna fit…

23:45.298 --> 23:47.843
…we can move forward
in creating the stained-glass effect.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.929
So now we know this fits in here
so we can take this out…

23:51.012 --> 23:51.847
Perfect.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.306
…and give it to them.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.016
Here's your piece of frame.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.311
I made it fit the opening, so you could
put a little… or black. Whatever.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.901
We'll start by spray painting
the window frame black to resemble lead,

24:05.735 --> 24:07.529
which is what the ancient Romans used.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.698
The lead, not the spray paint.

24:11.908 --> 24:15.829
Next, we'll fill each frame with
a thin layer of epoxy and let it cure.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.001
Then, we'll mix the epoxy, hardener,
and different shades of pigment.

24:22.752 --> 24:25.547
And we'll pour one color
of dyed resin in each section

24:25.630 --> 24:27.883
to replicate the look of stained-glass.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.345
We'll allow the epoxy time to cure.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.265
And that, my friends,
is how you put the "win" in window.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.812
Check it out.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.858
-It looks so good.
-And it really looks like stained glass.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.193
-It does.
-Yeah.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.319
Pizza pie.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.285
<i>Pizza.</i>

24:56.912 --> 24:58.497
-Ta-da!
-Wow!

24:58.580 --> 24:59.498
Right?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.500
-That's a cannon.
-Yeah.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.169
That's a wood cannon. Next step
is getting this thing off the lathe.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.128
Yep.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.423
This line here. We're gonna have
to cut that on the band saw, in half.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.177
Oh.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.813
-You got a machine gun cannon.
-Jimmy?

25:23.897 --> 25:26.358
-Yeah.
-Might need a bit of help here.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.527
-Graz? Stand here.
-Yeah.

25:28.610 --> 25:32.489
Yeah. Kind of bend down, maybe?
Put your ponytail in there and cut it off.

25:33.406 --> 25:36.743
-Derek, give them a hand.
-No. You said you had it.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.371
Derek, come over here with me,
just in case.

25:39.454 --> 25:43.917
<i>On the next episode of</i>
The Real Makers of DiResta County,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.544
<i>Cannon Cutting Edition.</i>

25:45.627 --> 25:47.420
Everybody
put on your safety goggles.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.090
<i> Jimmy and the gang</i>
<i>cut their toughest cannon yet.</i>

25:50.173 --> 25:51.424
Jackman, you guide it.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.509
-You got it?
Yep.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.886
<i>Can the cutters cut</i>
<i>where no cutter has cut before?</i>

25:54.970 --> 25:57.305
-What's happening?
-<i> Or will their cannon plans…</i>

25:57.389 --> 26:00.267
-Hold on! Wait! It's twisting!
-<i>…get canned?</i>

26:00.350 --> 26:01.351
It's way off.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.520
Turn it off.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.730
I want to make an episode
about shooting pizza.

26:05.814 --> 26:06.898
What do you guys think?

26:06.982 --> 26:10.068
<i>Tune in to</i>
The Real Makers of DiResta County,

26:10.151 --> 26:11.903
<i>Cannon Cutting Edition.</i>

26:11.987 --> 26:12.904
That didn't work.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.865
Considering that could
be a second failure,

26:15.949 --> 26:19.077
and we only have one more blade to try,
let's use the chainsaw.

26:19.160 --> 26:19.995
Yep.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.540
Let's pull it out and get it rested
on the ground, and I'll fix the band saw.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.292
Thanks, guys. Thanks for nothing.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.668
I'm glad we could help.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.795
This band saw is typically unstoppable.

26:28.878 --> 26:32.632
Can you make me a pizza cannon?
Except for a 500-pound pizza cannon.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.760
Make a pizza cannon.
Make a pizza cannon. 200 dollar blade.

26:35.844 --> 26:39.055
Make a pizza cannon.
What do you want me to do?

26:39.139 --> 26:40.265
-Jimmy.
-What?

26:40.348 --> 26:42.851
-What do you need me to do?
-Go put the mast on.

26:42.934 --> 26:43.768
Okay.

26:44.894 --> 26:47.897
Since we couldn't cut
our cannon in half using Jimmy's band saw,

26:47.981 --> 26:50.650
-I'm gonna go with option two. Chainsaw.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.193
A chainsaw will do the trick,

26:52.277 --> 26:54.779
and the only reason
we didn't go for it as our first option

26:54.863 --> 26:57.907
was because chainsaws
can be a little messier and less precise.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.577
That is unless you're strong,
young men like Pat and myself,

27:00.660 --> 27:01.911
and not a couple of, uh…

27:02.954 --> 27:04.205
-Well, you get it.

27:09.085 --> 27:11.588
We've split our cannon,
and according to my calculations,

27:11.671 --> 27:14.090
each of these halves
is half the weight of the original cannon.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.176
-Hm.
-Are we gonna hollow it out?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.677
-Yeah.
-That's the next step.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.262
What are we waiting for?

27:19.346 --> 27:20.889
Hey, come on, Jimmy. Relax.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.603
-Feel better?
-Yeah.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.521
Thank you for sharing that with us.

27:29.105 --> 27:33.276
Although this pizza pirate ship
is proving to be a huge waste of time,

27:33.360 --> 27:34.653
and saw blades,

27:34.736 --> 27:37.489
it's gonna blow these kids' socks off
when it's finished.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.532
And power is all in the details,

27:39.616 --> 27:43.495
like this decorative wooden trim,
or the mast carved from a tree,

27:43.578 --> 27:45.163
that's gonna get us there.

27:45.246 --> 27:47.666
-Nice.
-Doesn't have to be straight, I guess.

27:47.749 --> 27:51.586
-I guess it's funnier if it's crooked.
-I tried to match it with Graz's nose.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.840
Jimmy, you guys thinking about
putting a crow's nest up here?

27:55.924 --> 27:58.009
Yeah, a cartoon-y one.
We don't wanna make a real one.

27:58.093 --> 27:59.928
-From here?
-Yeah. That would be good.

28:00.011 --> 28:03.306
I'll make the crow's nest. I'll make it
the size of maybe a five-gallon bucket.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.641
That seems about right.

28:04.724 --> 28:07.060
Will you make it
from a five-gallon bucket?

28:07.143 --> 28:09.396
-I'll make it out of wood.
-Okay.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.985
The crow's nest is the structure
at the top of the mast

28:16.069 --> 28:19.114
where somebody can stand
and look out for enemy ships or land

28:19.197 --> 28:20.990
so they can bury their treasure.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.953
Oh God, you guys caught me digging
around for treasure on my own, huh?

28:25.036 --> 28:26.204
Moving on.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.957
To save weight,
our crow's nest will be made to scale

28:29.040 --> 28:31.501
and serve no purpose other than looks,

28:31.584 --> 28:33.461
just like they described me
in high school.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.548
-If there is less yodeling…

28:36.631 --> 28:40.385
…and more building, this pizza pirate ship
will be ready to sail in no time.

28:47.016 --> 28:51.062
When the window goes in, put a nail in it
because it's gonna wanna fall down.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.064
<i> Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Children calling.</i>

28:53.148 --> 28:56.943
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Time to talk to the kids again.</i>

28:57.944 --> 28:58.820
Abe.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.739
<i>-Hello.</i>
<i>-Hello.</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:02.490
Hello. What are you guys doing?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.284
<i>I have a question.</i>

29:05.076 --> 29:08.079
-Okay.
<i>-How is the ship going?</i>

29:08.163 --> 29:09.205
It's going really good.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.875
Can you see anything?
Can you see a piece of it right here?

29:11.958 --> 29:13.626
<i>I can see some of it.</i>

29:13.710 --> 29:15.712
<i>No. I just see an old man.</i>

29:15.795 --> 29:17.505
<i>-Ow!</i>

29:19.174 --> 29:21.843
<i>-Wait. One important thing.</i>
-Uh-oh.

29:21.926 --> 29:26.431
<i>We want a merman on the front of the ship.</i>

29:26.514 --> 29:27.724
So not a mermaid?

29:27.807 --> 29:28.725
<i>Not a mermaid.</i>

29:28.808 --> 29:30.518
<i>-Merman.</i>
<i>-Merman.</i>

29:31.311 --> 29:33.062
<i> Uh-oh. Storm ahead.</i>

29:33.146 --> 29:35.982
<i>Mer-can Jimmy make a merman?</i>

29:36.649 --> 29:38.568
Everyone's cool with making a merman?

29:38.651 --> 29:39.652
-Sure.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

29:39.736 --> 29:41.196
-Merman.
-<i>Merman.</i>

29:41.279 --> 29:43.448
-Merman.
-Oh.Pat likes the merman.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.617
<i>Okay. That was easy.</i>

29:45.700 --> 29:47.410
<i>I have a question for you.</i>

29:47.494 --> 29:49.537
-Oh God.
-I hate when he says that.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.582
<i>Is this what you wanted</i>
<i>your life to come to?</i>

29:55.585 --> 29:57.253
-Answer the kid.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.755
Oh my gosh.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.466
I'm not sure.
You really hit, you really hit…

30:01.549 --> 30:02.467
<i>That's sad.</i>

30:03.551 --> 30:04.594
It is.

30:04.677 --> 30:07.430
-Can we go back to building now?
<i>-Okay. Get to work.</i>

30:11.434 --> 30:12.936
Goodbye. Wow.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.022
What the hell was that?
Do they always talk to you like that?

30:16.105 --> 30:18.316
No. These two are very extra special.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.486
There's a lot of stuff to do.
I'll work on the merman.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.405
We gotta paint this thing,
we gotta put up the sails,

30:24.489 --> 30:26.157
finish up the stained glass.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.158
Let's get to work.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.878
Okay.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.714
Big Abe wants a merman,

30:41.798 --> 30:45.677
and I made this little sketch model,
which would kind of be the concept.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.721
We could use Pat's real face
as the merman face,

30:48.805 --> 30:50.139
but this is obviously too small.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.725
This was just my breadboard concept model.

30:52.809 --> 30:56.479
I'm gonna use the blue foam,
a little spray glue, a little spray foam,

30:56.563 --> 30:58.731
and make a big merman
at the front of the boat.

31:02.443 --> 31:05.989
Extruded polystyrene foam, or XPS,

31:06.489 --> 31:09.242
is a dense foam
that is often used to insulate homes.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.620
XPS is a great crafting material
because it's light,

31:12.704 --> 31:15.373
easy to work with,
and it carves beautifully.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.001
It's also water-resistant,

31:18.084 --> 31:21.421
because what kind of merman would he be
if he couldn't handle getting a bit wet?

31:22.922 --> 31:25.717
Like Graz, our merman
is looking a little bit scrawny,

31:25.800 --> 31:28.970
so I'm gonna use spray foam
to add some meat to them bones.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.556
Everyone else is busy. You have two hands.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.224
You paint the boat.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.354
-Once the spray foam is cured,

31:38.438 --> 31:40.648
I'll use an angle grinder
to sculpt muscles

31:40.732 --> 31:42.483
and add some definition to this body.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.152
Now all we have to do is paint him,

31:44.235 --> 31:47.697
and this hunky merman is gonna look
like he swam straight from the gym

31:47.780 --> 31:49.574
onto the front of our pirate ship.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.409
Looks good.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.468
<i>What? No vegetables?</i>

32:08.551 --> 32:10.678
Extra pep in your step.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.772
-Beautifully done.
-Thank you.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.398
It's making me hungry.

32:23.024 --> 32:27.487
Justine, with this, I think
we can actually sail the seven cheese.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.697
Yeah. I bet.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.159
Derek, how's that pizza wheel coming?

32:34.994 --> 32:36.663
Justine, how are the flags?

32:36.746 --> 32:37.705
Almost done.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.790
Jackman?

32:38.873 --> 32:41.417
-I'm in the process of fixing the cannon.
-Pat?

32:41.501 --> 32:44.045
I'm working on
watching Jackman finish the cannon.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.922
Good. Graz?

32:46.005 --> 32:49.467
I just finished painting the ship.
I'm gonna get to the molding.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.927
Let's drive this ship home.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.845
Aye aye, Captain Grey Beard.

32:52.929 --> 32:53.846
Okay.

32:55.848 --> 32:59.310
That's what I was about to say.
Looks as stable as my grandmother.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.105
It says right on it,
"This is not a step."

33:02.188 --> 33:05.358
The pizza ship is almost done. Thank God.

33:05.441 --> 33:08.861
Because I'm about to make like a ship
and set sail right on out of here.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.868
-You good over there?
-Yeah.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.746
To complete the barrel
of the cannon,

33:18.830 --> 33:21.666
Jackman and Pat
will install the pizza slingshot

33:21.749 --> 33:23.876
and seal the hollow cannon halves.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.965
Derek is finally getting to the steering
wheel, also known as the helm,

33:29.048 --> 33:32.760
but this might be the longest
it's ever taken to get a pizza delivered.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.472
We need to build a trunnion
for the cannon,

33:36.556 --> 33:41.269
which consists of a stock, axle,
two wheels, so we can position and aim it.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.442
Graz and Justine
will finish up the decorative details,

33:47.525 --> 33:50.862
such as the molding,
the pizza slice bunting flags…

33:52.864 --> 33:55.742
And lastly,
printing the name on the stern.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.204
Guys, pencils down. Let's take a look.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.540
I think we outdid ourselves.
It looks amazing.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.750
Let's get out of here.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.502
Can't wait to show
these little pizza eaters what we made.

34:09.839 --> 34:13.176
<i>Arrr! Avast, ye scallywags!</i>

34:14.052 --> 34:16.721
You ready to show these kids
their pizza pirate dream?

34:17.346 --> 34:19.474
We gotta get to work
before the rain kicks in.

34:19.557 --> 34:23.519
Let me get Abe and Leah up here.
Show these ungrateful kids what we did.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.229
<i>-Hello!</i>

34:25.313 --> 34:26.689
Hey. How are you guys?

34:26.773 --> 34:28.483
<i>Hello, old people.</i>

34:28.566 --> 34:30.443
-Hello, young people.

34:30.943 --> 34:33.529
Let me get this straight.
You come on my show, insult me,

34:33.613 --> 34:36.741
demand I build a pirate ship,
and this is your level of excitement?

34:38.117 --> 34:40.161
Are you ready to see this pizza ship?

34:40.244 --> 34:42.288
<i> Yes!</i>

34:42.371 --> 34:44.123
All right, guys! Hit it!

34:44.207 --> 34:45.833
<i>Open that door!</i>

34:59.722 --> 35:01.516
<i>Whoa. </i>

35:04.811 --> 35:06.479
<i>It is beautiful!</i>

35:10.900 --> 35:12.735
<i>Wonderful! Wonderful!</i>

35:12.819 --> 35:16.030
What you are looking at
is definitely not seaworthy

35:16.114 --> 35:18.366
and barely road worthy.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.284
Pirate Pizza Ship.

35:20.368 --> 35:23.329
<i>That's the best pirate pizza ship</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

35:23.412 --> 35:25.998
-You seen a lot of these, huh?

35:28.709 --> 35:31.963
We started with a beautiful
compact car from my buddy's junkyard

35:32.046 --> 35:33.756
and built around it.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.883
Let's start from the top
and work our way down.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.468
Derek built the crow's nest.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.596
Then what would
a pizza ship be without a pizza wheel?

35:40.680 --> 35:43.141
<i>That is a spicy pizza meatball.</i>

35:43.224 --> 35:46.519
You asked for cool stained glass windows.
Graz, explain the windows.

35:46.602 --> 35:50.648
So we replicated stained glass,
but we did it our own way with epoxy.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.316
We dyed it with some pigments.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.861
And we put your name
and some pizza on the back.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.946
<i>Yo-ho-ho!</i>

35:57.947 --> 36:02.118
What pirate ship wouldn't be
complete without pizza sails and flags

36:03.119 --> 36:05.163
made by the masterful Justine?

36:05.246 --> 36:07.582
And, guys, how can we forget the merman?

36:07.665 --> 36:10.126
I sculpted the merman out of Styrofoam,

36:10.209 --> 36:12.712
and we left the head off
for a very special guest, Pat.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.422
<i>Yes.</i>

36:14.505 --> 36:16.340
<i>It is gorgeous. I love it.</i>

36:16.424 --> 36:18.301
<i>The merman with a hat.</i>

36:18.384 --> 36:21.053
All right. I think that's it.
I think we're done here.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.680
<i>-Wait.</i>
-What?

36:22.763 --> 36:25.266
<i>The cannon shooting at the ship.</i>

36:25.349 --> 36:26.559
Oh.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.686
<i>-That is what we wanna see.</i>
<i>-Where's the cannon?</i>

36:28.769 --> 36:30.855
Jackman, you got the pizza cannon
locked and loaded?

36:30.938 --> 36:31.814
It's ready to go.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.775
All right. Let's set sail.
Let's get this battle underway.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.616
Welcome to the invasion
of DiResta Island,

36:41.699 --> 36:43.659
or as I call it, the dumb part of the show

36:43.743 --> 36:46.704
where we show you kids
your stupid inventions in action.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.789
<i>-Hey! They're not stupid!</i>
<i>-You're stupid!</i>

36:48.873 --> 36:50.208
<i>You're a moron!</i>

36:50.291 --> 36:52.752
I'm about to show you
your stupid pizza cannon. Wanna see it?

36:52.835 --> 36:53.753
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

36:53.836 --> 36:56.589
<i>I'm so excited, I could poop my pants.</i>

36:56.672 --> 36:58.591
-That's great, Abe. Thank you.
-What?

36:59.592 --> 37:02.762
We turned this out of a giant red oak log.
It was like 600 pounds.

37:02.845 --> 37:06.849
Crafted it out of that and some plywood
and a slingshot mechanism on the inside,

37:06.933 --> 37:08.768
some CNC'd wheels that it rolls around--

37:08.851 --> 37:10.269
-Hey, wake up!
<i>-Huh?</i>

37:10.353 --> 37:11.687
Am I boring you, Abe?

37:11.771 --> 37:13.773
<i>Um, no.</i>

37:13.856 --> 37:16.484
It's a cannon that fires pizzas.
What else could you possibly want?

37:16.567 --> 37:18.027
<i>To see it fire.</i>

37:18.110 --> 37:20.196
All right. So here's how it's gonna work.

37:20.279 --> 37:23.115
We're gonna have the pizza pirates
drive the ship up the driveway,

37:23.199 --> 37:27.203
and gonna light them up with the cannon,
like it's the Pizza War of 1812.

37:27.286 --> 37:28.371
<i>Yes!</i>

37:28.454 --> 37:30.498
You wanna see some pizza
smash against the ship?

37:30.581 --> 37:32.500
<i>Yeah!</i>

37:32.583 --> 37:35.086
Jackman, load this thing up.
Let's get ready to go.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.337
Let's fire some pizzas.

37:39.548 --> 37:40.633
Locked and loaded.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.261
<i>Why the hell is there smoke?</i>

37:43.344 --> 37:45.763
The fog means the pirates
are on the horizon.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.556
Forward! Yarrr!

37:47.640 --> 37:50.434
I see a ship!
We must protect DiResta Island!

37:50.518 --> 37:51.978
No. Not into the tree.

37:52.061 --> 37:52.979
God.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.355
-Jeez.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.607
There's trees everywhere.
I can't see.

37:56.691 --> 37:58.025
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

37:58.609 --> 38:00.444
-Jackman, are you ready?
-Ready.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.238
Ahoy, mateys!

38:02.321 --> 38:05.074
There it is, Jackman. Try and hit Derek.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.826
<i>Fire!</i>

38:08.202 --> 38:09.870
-Okay. Oh my God.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.872
Loser!

38:12.873 --> 38:15.876
-Close, but no cigar.
-Quick! We're gonna try and hit him again.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.547
<i>Arrr!</i>

38:20.256 --> 38:21.507
Fire at him!

38:22.425 --> 38:23.968
-You hit the merman!

38:26.095 --> 38:28.556
What? Are we parallel parking?
What are we doing?

38:28.639 --> 38:29.974
Hit him! Hit him!

38:32.018 --> 38:34.353
Loser!

38:36.480 --> 38:38.107
You still can't hit me.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.819
Jackman, if you don't get one on my lap,
you have to eat a raw pizza.

38:41.902 --> 38:42.945
<i>-Raw pizza.</i>
-Wait.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.614
He's gonna hit him! Hit him! Hit him!

38:48.159 --> 38:50.494
You've got pizza
in your hat, matey.

38:50.578 --> 38:51.746
He's still a loser.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.500
Abe and Leah, are you guys satisfied?

38:56.584 --> 38:57.668
<i>Yes!</i>

38:57.752 --> 38:58.836
Did you have fun?

38:58.919 --> 38:59.962
<i>Yargh!</i>

39:00.046 --> 39:02.423
Did we make
all of your dumb kid dreams come true?

39:02.506 --> 39:04.216
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

39:04.717 --> 39:07.928
All right. Go stuff your faces with pizza.
You've earned it.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.181
<i>All righty. Thank you, matey.</i>

39:11.891 --> 39:13.768
-That was fun.
It was fun.

39:13.851 --> 39:16.729
I'm going to get dry.
Sail this piece of ship out of here.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.065
-All right.
-Shift it into "R."

39:20.024 --> 39:21.275
Farewell.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.527
-Which way am I going?
-Okay. Back up.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.695
Steer slight left.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.197
Whoo-hoo.
