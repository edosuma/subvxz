24:32.800 --> 24:35.600
Someone really wants
to get hold of you.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.520
It's Sam. I told him what happened.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.320
-You're still in touch with Sam?
-What do we do with all his stuff?

24:40.400 --> 24:42.920
It can't just stay there forever, can it?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.360
It can't just sit there.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.840
[phone chimes]

25:06.400 --> 25:08.520
Jamie, love...

25:09.920 --> 25:11.960
Ma! Would it kill you to knock?

25:13.280 --> 25:16.440
You should come downstairs.
We should try and eat something.

25:16.520 --> 25:17.800
I'm not hungry.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.040
I can't stop wondering why.

25:43.720 --> 25:47.280
Why? Just for money? A robbery?

25:50.720 --> 25:53.240
Adam Elliot was always
a wayward sort.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.840
Nothing but trouble, even as a lad.
You remember.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.560
Then he gets our Gracie pregnant,

26:01.640 --> 26:03.360
when she's got her whole life
ahead of her.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.120
Irresponsible, that's just who he is.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.280
What are you saying?

26:13.360 --> 26:16.040
Someone broke into their home.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.200
Maybe there was a reason.
Maybe Adam was involved in something...

26:20.280 --> 26:22.320
[knock at door]

26:22.400 --> 26:23.960
Alright, folks?

26:25.400 --> 26:27.040
What are you still doing here?

26:27.920 --> 26:32.440
I wanted to make sure that everything
was done on the farm

26:32.520 --> 26:35.800
and that everything was locked down
for the storm tonight.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.640
You're not going home in this, are you?

26:39.280 --> 26:43.960
-It's just a bit of weather, Bill.
-No. No. Absolutely not, no way.

26:44.040 --> 26:47.560
I won't hear of it, Alastair,
at least until it passes.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.720
-He should stay, shouldn't he?
-Of course. We insist.

-[Claire] Who is he?
-[Rob] Round the other side.

28:02.360 --> 28:03.920

Who is he?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.480
[Rob] Oh, my God!

28:05.560 --> 28:07.600
Hello? Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

28:07.680 --> 28:10.600
-I'll call an ambulance.
-Yes, yes! You do that, Mum.

28:10.680 --> 28:13.280
You know a hell of a lot more
than me, Claire. Can we move him?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.760
-Support his head! Get his legs!
-OK, OK.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.920
We'll need something to carry him on!
What can we use?

28:20.280 --> 28:21.440
Oh, shit!

28:21.520 --> 28:23.720
Don't move him any more
than you have to!

28:23.800 --> 28:25.600
I've got it! I've got it!

28:25.680 --> 28:27.400
-OK.
-His leg's stuck!

28:27.480 --> 28:32.920
Alright. Easy. Easy. Easy.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.320
-Be careful with him.
-Slide him over, yeah?

28:35.400 --> 28:36.840
OK.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.200
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

28:43.360 --> 28:46.160
-We need to get him inside.
-OK, wait.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.240

28:53.960 --> 28:55.680
-Just pull!
-Lift!

29:04.440 --> 29:07.360
I don't know. It looks...

29:07.440 --> 29:10.880
I mean, his... his leg is hurt and...

29:12.640 --> 29:13.760
Oh.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.560
-Settle him here.
-Alright, OK.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.400
Well... yeah, yeah, OK.

29:20.480 --> 29:23.120
But quick as you can, please, yeah?

29:25.120 --> 29:27.480
Helicopters aren't coming out in the storm

29:27.560 --> 29:30.720
and the ambulance says
it'll be several hours.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.200
The roads have all flooded,
apparently, all over.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.120
This is useless.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.080
He's got an open fracture.
I'm gonna need to splint.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.240
What about Bill? Maybe he has
some vet supplies at the farm.

29:41.320 --> 29:44.680
That'd work. Rob, get over there,
grab everything you can.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.080
Wait. Do you need me to come?

29:46.160 --> 29:48.400
No, no. I'll be fine. It's only next door.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.840

We've called an ambulance,

32:05.960 --> 32:07.400
It's got our postcode on it.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.320
Why would he have our postcode
written down?

32:09.400 --> 32:10.880
So he was coming here?

32:10.960 --> 32:13.640
Or Bill and Moira's,
the postcode's the same.

I found the money, sweetheart,
for the operation.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.160
I knew that you would.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.680
Maybe we can start
to feel normal again.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.440
Wouldn't that be nice?

45:36.040 --> 45:37.800
[gasps]

45:46.760 --> 45:49.360
[panicky breathing]

45:51.280 --> 45:54.160
[Claire shouts indistinctly]

45:54.240 --> 45:55.920
[Bill] What is it? Calm down!

45:56.000 --> 45:58.440
[Claire continues to shout indistinctly]

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Someone here did this.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.240
It wasn't me.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.200
So who?

46:33.560 --> 46:36.440
Look, the storm's over. The police
will be here any minute, so...

46:36.520 --> 46:37.680
[Rob] No.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.880
No, they won't be.

46:46.880 --> 46:48.560
I couldn't call them.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.480
I, uh...

46:52.080 --> 46:54.200
I told the ambulance not to come.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.680
Jesus! Rob, what have you done?

46:59.640 --> 47:02.080
[Rob] I was so angry and I...

47:05.280 --> 47:07.400
I wanted to just...

47:10.040 --> 47:13.440
let nature just take its course.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.760
[breathes heavily]

47:21.640 --> 47:23.120
[door opens]

47:23.200 --> 47:25.280
[kick echoes]

47:34.080 --> 47:36.160
[Louise] Oh, my God.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.880
Your boy... Your boy's going
to go to prison for this.

47:39.960 --> 47:42.880
He didn't do it. He didn't.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.520
I... I... I...

47:45.600 --> 47:47.120
I...

47:47.200 --> 47:50.000
I saw someone last night...

47:50.080 --> 47:52.680
walking through the yard,
towards this barn,

47:52.760 --> 47:55.080
but it wasn't Rob.
It wasn't, I'm sure of it.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.160
Oh, come on!
He's as good as admitted it.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.240
Don't tell me you know
what's happening, Moira!

47:59.320 --> 48:01.400
-Because you don't have a clue!
-[all arguing]

48:01.480 --> 48:03.080
He said he was going
to call the police.

48:03.160 --> 48:07.040
Mum, we will just call the police
and the police will sort this out.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.720
Your boys are rotten to the core.
They're septic.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.920
But there's no surprise there, is there?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.880
They're just like their father.
They're their father's sons.

48:14.960 --> 48:17.320
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree,
does it, Louise?

48:17.400 --> 48:20.400
[Louise] How dare you talk about my sons
like that? How dare you!

48:20.480 --> 48:22.640
-What?
-I need to talk to you.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.560
It's OK. We'll call the police

48:25.640 --> 48:27.320
It wasn't, it wasn't...

48:29.480 --> 48:32.400
Anna! Just wait!

48:34.200 --> 48:37.080
Anna? Wait.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.680
-I just... I just needed some air.
-I didn't do this.

48:40.760 --> 48:44.000
I know I lied about calling the police,
but that was just a mistake.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.480
-I wasn't thinking.
-Would you tell me if you did?

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
Of course I would.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.680
Same way you told me
you've been stalking Graham Harris?

49:02.200 --> 49:03.760
He raped you.

49:08.720 --> 49:11.120
And you said...

49:11.200 --> 49:13.920
You said you wanted to kill him.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.680
Yeah, but I didn't hurt him.

49:16.920 --> 49:20.000
I thought about it... but I didn't.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.120
I thought about it, too.

49:28.960 --> 49:30.640
I don't...

49:30.720 --> 49:35.160
I don't blame you. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't blame you for any of it.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.160
You sure about this?

49:52.240 --> 49:54.000
Aye, Bill, I'm sure.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.840
We should talk to him, now.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.480
W-What's going on?

50:12.560 --> 50:16.280
That man, the suspect
that Rob saw on TV...

50:17.480 --> 50:19.760
he came here last night
and now he's dead.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.480
-OK.
-Is that all you've got to say?

50:25.440 --> 50:27.200
A man is dead.

50:27.280 --> 50:30.560
-But you knew that, didn't you, Jamie?
-Why would you say that?

50:30.640 --> 50:32.400
I saw you, son.

50:33.120 --> 50:36.520
I couldn't sleep. I got up
and I saw you come out of the barn.

50:36.600 --> 50:40.160
Louise saw you, too.
She saw someone, anyway.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.560
Was it you, Jamie?

50:46.200 --> 50:47.920
Just...

50:48.000 --> 50:51.400
Please, just tell us the truth
so we can help you.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.480
I just...

50:56.560 --> 50:58.480
I wanted to look at him.

50:59.480 --> 51:00.800
[Moira] Why?

51:02.320 --> 51:04.560
To see the person who killed Grace.

51:12.720 --> 51:15.560
Fine. If you think I'm guilty,
let the police decide.

51:22.320 --> 51:24.120
[door closes]

51:24.200 --> 51:26.800
[Bill] I'd never thought he'd be
capable of something like this.

51:26.880 --> 51:30.400
I'm praying that he didn't, but...
it wasn't that long ago...

51:30.480 --> 51:34.760
That's in the past, Moira.
He's gotten his head straight now.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.480
[Alastair] As far as I'm concerned,
you two are family.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.760
You've already lost one bairn.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.520
I will not let you risk losing another,

51:42.600 --> 51:44.480
not over that piece of dirt.

51:44.560 --> 51:47.120
[Moira] Whatever he's done,
he's our son, Bill.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.360
Right. OK.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.800
No, thanks. No, no, I've got it.

52:01.720 --> 52:02.880
Boss?

52:04.280 --> 52:07.960
-Oi, where's DI Wallis?
-On the phone.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.400
[sighs]

52:15.160 --> 52:17.440
-[clears throat]
-That's right, OK.

52:17.520 --> 52:19.040
Boss?

52:19.120 --> 52:22.760
The Adam and Grace Elliot case,
got a sighting of Lee Walsh.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.560
Some guy in a garage
recognized him off the news.

52:25.640 --> 52:27.560
He was getting petrol
at a service station.

52:27.640 --> 52:29.320
-ANPR verified it.
-[phone vibrates]

52:29.400 --> 52:31.800
Location's marked on a map,
should be with you now.

52:31.880 --> 52:34.240
20 miles south of where
the victims grew up.

52:35.600 --> 52:37.640
Who's the liaison officer?

52:37.720 --> 52:40.240
Uh, local cop, uh, Fuller, I think.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.840
Get him on the phone now.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.160
[door opens]

53:07.000 --> 53:08.760
Did you call the police?

53:14.040 --> 53:16.320
-No.
-Why not?

53:18.240 --> 53:22.200
We've had a talk,
me and your brother.

53:25.200 --> 53:28.200
We don't need any more harm
coming to our families.

53:29.520 --> 53:31.120
To either of them.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.520
We've suffered enough.

53:35.480 --> 53:37.080
Don't you think?

53:39.360 --> 53:44.520
Now, we've all seen the news
and the watch that he took from him.

53:48.200 --> 53:51.360
The man in that cage...

53:52.920 --> 53:55.400
killed Adam and Grace.

53:55.480 --> 53:57.720
But the police don't know
that he's here.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.160
What are you saying?

54:02.240 --> 54:04.480
I'm not saying anything.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.320
I think we should just...

54:11.000 --> 54:12.400
take a moment...

54:15.520 --> 54:17.760
and think about what happens
if they do come here.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.560
One of us did this.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.520
One of us, right here.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.040
Now, do we want that person
going to prison...

54:40.120 --> 54:42.120
because of him?

54:42.200 --> 54:44.560
His face is all over the news!

54:44.640 --> 54:46.240
They're looking for him!

54:46.320 --> 54:49.640
What about the press? I mean...
the phones are ringing off the hook.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.560
They'll be on our doorstep in no time.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.880
Then we'll deal with it.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.000
We... We can't do that!

54:56.080 --> 54:58.320
We need to come clean
about all of this!

54:58.400 --> 55:00.000
Can't you see that?

55:00.080 --> 55:01.440
I don't know.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.920
I don't know what to think anymore.

55:09.200 --> 55:11.480
I've lost my boy. I just...

55:16.000 --> 55:19.400
-I just want all this to go away.
-[Jamie] Dad?

55:22.560 --> 55:23.880
Jamie, just stay there.

55:23.960 --> 55:26.080
-But you've got a phone call.
-Not now.

55:26.160 --> 55:28.200
It's the police.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.480
Go back in the house.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.200
Go on.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.960
Bill Douglas here.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.880
Us and... and Louise Elliot.

56:08.960 --> 56:10.880
I'm looking at her right now.

56:12.680 --> 56:14.200
It's fine.

56:15.240 --> 56:16.760
Everything's OK.

56:22.840 --> 56:24.600
When she gets here?

56:27.680 --> 56:29.800
But thanks for letting me know.

56:29.880 --> 56:33.400
Will do, alright. Bye. Bye.

56:36.440 --> 56:37.880
Charlie Fuller.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.600
The detective's coming from Edinburgh.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.840
What? What have you done?

56:45.920 --> 56:48.960
What was I supposed to say, Claire?

56:49.040 --> 56:51.880
OK, what are we going to do?

57:08.960 --> 57:12.440
Nothing like an eight-hour delay to really
reset your body clock, is there, eh?

57:12.520 --> 57:16.120
-Maybe you're just getting a bit old, eh?
-Ooh, ouch.

57:17.400 --> 57:18.800
[clears throat]

57:23.880 --> 57:29.320
<i>You have one new message,</i>
<i>received yesterday, 4:11pm.</i>

57:29.400 --> 57:31.440
<i>Dad, it's Claire.</i>

57:32.080 --> 57:34.160
<i>I don't know how else to say this.</i>

57:35.920 --> 57:37.800
<i>Adam...</i>

57:37.880 --> 57:39.240
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

57:40.960 --> 57:42.680
<i>Adam's dead.</i>

57:42.760 --> 57:44.560
<i>Someone killed him.</i>

57:44.640 --> 57:46.840
<i>Him and Grace.</i>

57:46.920 --> 57:50.000
-Are you alright? Who was that?
-[hangs up]

57:52.080 --> 57:53.680
No one.
