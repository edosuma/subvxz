00:02.048 --> 00:05.083
_

00:05.085 --> 00:07.085
I like your plane, Frankie.

00:07.087 --> 00:09.655
He put it together himself.

00:16.328 --> 00:19.998
Okay, but you better eat your
vegetables tonight, Frankie boy.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.433
That kid.
Such a little Hooligan.

00:22.435 --> 00:23.968
Just like his old man.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.469
You were the one
who toilet papered

00:25.471 --> 00:27.072
the neighbor's house
right before a thunderstorm,

00:27.074 --> 00:28.506
until ma busted you.

00:29.108 --> 00:30.941
Marched me over there
to apologize.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.676
Mm-hmm,
whining and crying.

00:32.677 --> 00:34.544
Took you, like, a week
to clean it all up.

00:41.854 --> 00:44.788
Getting partial custody's
done you good, Jess.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.224
Every other weekend
and a day each week.

00:47.226 --> 00:49.058
Frankie doesn't have to hear

00:49.060 --> 00:50.794
his ma and me hollering
at each other.

00:50.796 --> 00:52.629
Can't complain.

00:52.631 --> 00:55.164
And you're dry.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.999
Get my two-year chip
in... three weeks.

00:57.001 --> 00:59.001
You coming to the meeting?

00:59.003 --> 01:00.503
Wouldn't miss it.

01:00.505 --> 01:02.672
- If you have class or something...
- Mm-mm.

01:02.674 --> 01:04.173
Don't.

01:04.175 --> 01:06.075
You're the reason
I can afford law school anyway.

01:06.077 --> 01:08.711
I'm just doing it
for the bragging rights.

01:08.713 --> 01:11.380
My brother the lawyer.

01:11.382 --> 01:15.818
How about...
your brother the prosecutor?

01:15.820 --> 01:17.653
You know?

01:17.655 --> 01:20.189
That's what I really wanna do.

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.265 --> 01:30.432
Jesse Brandt?

01:30.434 --> 01:31.767
Who are you?

01:31.769 --> 01:33.201
FBI, sir.
You need to come with us.

01:33.203 --> 01:34.436
<i>What? Why?</i>

01:34.438 --> 01:38.073
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

01:38.075 --> 01:39.640
It's okay, son.

01:39.642 --> 01:41.042
You stay with your uncle Peter.

01:41.044 --> 01:43.745
What are the charges?

01:43.747 --> 01:45.380
I asked you a question.

01:45.382 --> 01:46.948
We don't need to answer
your question, sir.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.584
National Security exception.
Read the warrant.

01:51.321 --> 01:52.888
My brother's
an airline mechanic.

01:52.890 --> 01:56.424
You got the wrong guy!

01:56.426 --> 01:58.225
Jesse, it's gonna be fine.

01:58.227 --> 01:59.861
I'll get this sorted out, okay?

02:10.155 --> 02:14.069
_

02:14.186 --> 02:17.157
_

02:17.380 --> 02:21.000
_

02:33.261 --> 02:35.896
You need to talk to us, Otto.

02:35.898 --> 02:37.764
All we wanna know is...

02:44.304 --> 02:47.640
Why do these Decima guys
keep killing themselves?

02:47.642 --> 02:49.275
It's for the insurance.

02:49.277 --> 02:52.911
Each agent gets a policy
when they join the organization.

02:52.913 --> 02:55.481
Get caught, get nothing.

02:55.483 --> 02:57.049
Have an accident...

02:57.051 --> 03:00.119
Their next of kin
gets a payday.

03:00.121 --> 03:03.421
Well, Mr. Payday there
was our last lead on Finch.

03:03.423 --> 03:05.924
We're back to square one.

03:05.926 --> 03:08.693
The machine says we have
other things to worry about.

03:08.695 --> 03:10.328
Greer has Finch.

03:10.330 --> 03:13.098
He's the only thing
we have to worry about.

03:13.100 --> 03:16.001
I understand
how you feel, John.

03:16.003 --> 03:18.836
But she assured me Harold's not
in immediate danger.

03:18.838 --> 03:21.339
<i>And we have a larger threat</i>
<i>at hand.</i>

03:21.341 --> 03:23.241
You wanna expand on that?

03:23.243 --> 03:25.310
She can't see the full picture.

03:25.312 --> 03:27.279
Well, how can we help
when the machine can't even see

03:27.281 --> 03:28.913
what's going on?

03:28.915 --> 03:30.742
We'll be her eyes and ears.

03:38.690 --> 03:44.128
I apologize for the...
unpleasant accommodation.

03:44.130 --> 03:48.599
It's truly a pleasure to put
a face to the name, Mr. Finch.

03:48.601 --> 03:50.967
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time now.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.437
What is it that you want,
Mr. Greer?

03:53.439 --> 03:56.072
I want to talk
about the future.

03:56.074 --> 03:58.709
And who more qualified
for that conversation

03:58.711 --> 04:01.612
than the father
of artificial intelligence?

04:01.614 --> 04:04.715
An unintended side effect
of an altruistic goal.

04:04.717 --> 04:06.450
Altruism?

04:06.452 --> 04:08.551
Funny.

04:08.553 --> 04:13.123
I'd always imagined it was
about the power of creation.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.891
I've felt it myself.

04:14.893 --> 04:16.459
Your endeavor
to bring Samaritan online

04:16.461 --> 04:19.296
is a grave error in judgment.

04:19.298 --> 04:23.399
You must've known
this moment would come.

04:23.401 --> 04:26.402
Or did you think nobody else
could accomplish what you did,

04:26.404 --> 04:28.471
that you were unique?

04:28.473 --> 04:29.839
I must admit

04:29.841 --> 04:33.075
you played everyone
very well...

04:33.077 --> 04:35.211
right up until this moment.

04:35.213 --> 04:39.349
And now your God
has disappeared,

04:39.351 --> 04:43.886
operating on its own accord.

04:43.888 --> 04:48.958
Children can be
so disappointing.

04:50.793 --> 04:53.528
The world needs structure,
Mr. Finch...

04:53.530 --> 04:55.831
and Samaritan
will provide that.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.467
I'd beware of false idols,
Mr. Greer.

04:58.469 --> 05:01.135
If you were so confident
that Samaritan was functional,

05:01.137 --> 05:03.304
why did you go to such
great lengths to find me?

05:03.306 --> 05:05.474
To keep an eye on you.

05:05.476 --> 05:08.477
As the father of AI,
you're the only man in the world

05:08.479 --> 05:10.211
who can destroy it.

05:10.213 --> 05:12.447
Where does that leave us then?

05:12.449 --> 05:14.849
Right here.

05:14.851 --> 05:18.652
Until the moment
Samaritan opens its eyes.

05:18.654 --> 05:20.355
And then the world...

05:20.357 --> 05:23.124
will no longer need you.

05:39.108 --> 05:42.376
Did you just steal a dead man's keys?

05:42.378 --> 05:45.413
She asked me to.
Can I borrow your knife, John?

05:54.622 --> 05:58.758
While Decima's too clever
to use GPS...

05:58.760 --> 06:01.161
The satellite radio
has a GPS transponder.

06:01.163 --> 06:04.196
The boys might be able
to pull off some data,

06:04.198 --> 06:06.032
<i>find out</i>
<i>where our recently deceased</i>

06:06.034 --> 06:07.700
Decima friend has been.

06:07.702 --> 06:09.375
The boys?

06:10.539 --> 06:12.739
Hey, shut the door.
It's freezing.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.145
I know them!

06:18.147 --> 06:21.781
They helped you rescue me
from Collier.

06:21.783 --> 06:23.549
You're that government hit man
that made me pull out my molars.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.018
That's messed up.

06:25.020 --> 06:28.087
Relax, Casey.
I'm retired.

06:28.089 --> 06:29.756
What are they doing here, Root?

06:29.758 --> 06:31.724
Daizo, Jason, Daniel, and I
have been on the road

06:31.726 --> 06:34.326
collecting certain...

06:34.328 --> 06:37.163
contraband
in the Tri-Cities.

06:37.165 --> 06:39.064
That sounds both vague
and dangerous.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.867
I was hoping we could use
your safe house, John,

06:41.869 --> 06:43.835
seeing as we went
to all the trouble

06:43.837 --> 06:46.772
of saving them
in the first place.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.043
And as much as I'd love
some girl talk,

06:51.045 --> 06:54.245
you need to go
to The Carlton Hotel.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.114
And, uh,
why do I need a satphone?

06:56.116 --> 06:57.716
Trust me.

07:03.255 --> 07:05.390
Quite the winter we're having.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.192
I don't supposed you're here
to sell me

07:07.194 --> 07:09.394
- on global climate change.
- Hmm.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.564
It would be nice if we could
prepare for the future

07:12.566 --> 07:14.965
instead of trying to clean up
after the past.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.201
<i>I'm meeting</i>
<i>with the president's</i>

07:16.203 --> 07:17.735
<i>intelligence advisor today.</i>

07:17.737 --> 07:20.738
Use the beta test results
to convince them.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.507
Samaritan is a sleeping giant.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.942
We need those feeds
to awaken it.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.143
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

07:26.145 --> 07:28.145
Don't worry, Mr. Greer.

07:28.147 --> 07:29.680
They still wanna buy
your system.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.282
Samaritan is not for sale,
Senator.

07:32.284 --> 07:35.152
Decima will retain ownership.

07:35.154 --> 07:40.725
We will provide you
the critical information.

07:40.727 --> 07:43.760
You want me to give
a private corporation access

07:43.762 --> 07:45.662
to the government feeds--

07:45.664 --> 07:47.931
to 300 million Americans--

07:47.933 --> 07:50.567
just so you can sell
the information back to us?

07:50.569 --> 07:53.604
Samaritan is far superior
to your last endeavor.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.839
It'll answer
all your questions,

07:55.841 --> 07:57.341
it won't create riddles.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.075
There'll be no numbers
to sort through.

07:59.077 --> 08:02.011
No uncertainties
about culpability.

08:02.013 --> 08:04.948
Just pure unfettered
information.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.017
Why would we agree to that?

08:08.019 --> 08:10.153
If we don't own the system,

08:10.155 --> 08:11.888
what exactly do we get?

08:11.890 --> 08:14.457
Plausible deniability.

08:14.459 --> 08:16.959
Samaritan is privately owned

08:16.961 --> 08:18.927
by a third party,

08:18.929 --> 08:20.763
one that can shoulder the blame

08:20.765 --> 08:23.699
for your next
civil liberties scandal.

08:26.336 --> 08:28.137
And if I say no?

08:28.139 --> 08:30.105
Those are my terms, Senator.

08:30.107 --> 08:31.874
You must ask yourself this.

08:31.876 --> 08:34.376
Do you wanna prevent
acts of terror...

08:34.378 --> 08:38.046
or do you wanna stay in the dark
and watch your country burn?

08:47.690 --> 08:49.023
That's all of 'em.

08:49.025 --> 08:51.793
Good.
Get to work, boys.

08:51.795 --> 08:54.329
<i>You got your hands
on seven Samaritan servers.</i>

08:54.331 --> 08:55.863
You find anything on them?

08:55.865 --> 08:58.333
No, but they'll definitely
find us

08:58.335 --> 09:00.302
if we don't get this right.

09:00.304 --> 09:01.311
How long?

09:01.312 --> 09:02.500
_

09:02.539 --> 09:04.839
Ask Jason for help
if you need it.

09:04.841 --> 09:07.675
He's very good at getting
into complex systems.

09:07.677 --> 09:10.611
You'll need this later.

09:10.613 --> 09:12.646
You're coming with me.

09:12.648 --> 09:14.215
Greenfield's not the only one

09:14.217 --> 09:16.750
who can get
into complex systems.

09:16.752 --> 09:19.287
I can help them
if you fill me in, Root.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.622
Not now, John.

09:21.624 --> 09:23.824
I need you for something else.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.136
Root, I'm at The Carlton.
What now?

09:36.138 --> 09:38.371
The machine doesn't know
exactly what it's looking for,

09:38.373 --> 09:40.340
so you'll need to tell me
<i>what you see.</i>

09:44.445 --> 09:47.147
I spy...

09:47.149 --> 09:50.016
government license plates.

09:52.519 --> 09:53.820
Secret Service.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.346
_

09:55.447 --> 09:56.155
_

09:56.270 --> 09:59.260
_

09:59.365 --> 10:01.453
_

10:01.551 --> 10:03.967
_

10:04.164 --> 10:05.314
_

10:05.444 --> 10:06.549
_

10:13.681 --> 10:15.439
The machine must be
seeing clearly now.

10:15.474 --> 10:17.709
We're getting numbers.

10:23.251 --> 10:24.549
Oh, my...

10:24.551 --> 10:26.785
Five of them.

10:26.787 --> 10:29.588
And I know the first one
by heart.

10:35.695 --> 10:37.061
<i>Control.</i>

10:37.063 --> 10:38.830
That's whose number we got?

10:38.832 --> 10:41.266
Control understands
how the machine works.

10:41.268 --> 10:42.901
So she's covering her tracks.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.602
Well, the machine saw something.

10:44.604 --> 10:48.839
And if Control is behind it,
then it's something bad.

10:50.841 --> 10:56.228
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

11:01.044 --> 11:03.912
Is this really
what the machine asked us to do,

11:03.914 --> 11:07.049
drink very bad coffee with...

11:07.051 --> 11:09.284
<i>unemployed college graduates?</i>

11:09.286 --> 11:11.887
Patience, John.

11:11.889 --> 11:13.221
Are you in, Shaw?

11:14.391 --> 11:16.725
15th floor,
just like you asked.

11:16.727 --> 11:18.193
You wanna tell me
where I'm going?

11:18.195 --> 11:19.527
First door, down on your left.

11:19.529 --> 11:21.229
You'll need to let yourself in.

11:25.634 --> 11:27.702
Oh, you might wanna use
your silencer.

11:41.084 --> 11:43.283
Don't.

11:45.655 --> 11:48.388
Next time your
all-seeing other half

11:48.390 --> 11:51.391
wants me to break into a room
filled with Secret Service guys

11:51.393 --> 11:53.427
a little heads up
would be great.

11:53.429 --> 11:55.762
She knows
you can handle yourself.

12:02.170 --> 12:04.971
Okay, so we've got eyes and ears
on Control.

12:04.973 --> 12:07.974
She's with some
guy-- tall, gray hair.

12:07.976 --> 12:10.043
Very serious.

12:10.045 --> 12:12.445
Senator Ross Garrison,
our second number.

12:12.447 --> 12:13.980
Have their other friends
arrived yet?

12:13.982 --> 12:15.214
That woman's got friends?

12:15.216 --> 12:17.216
You want me to help Greer,

12:17.218 --> 12:19.352
the man who stole Samaritan
from me?

12:19.354 --> 12:21.287
Let's put your ego aside
for a moment, shall we?

12:21.289 --> 12:25.558
Ross, I know that Samaritan
is an excellent plan B.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.826
I just don't like having
to pay for something

12:27.828 --> 12:30.095
that belongs to me
in the first place.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.497
I accept
that you lost the battle

12:31.499 --> 12:33.098
so we can win the war.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.600
Besides,

12:34.602 --> 12:36.335
money isn't the issue here.

12:36.337 --> 12:39.539
I've seen the black budget.
You've got plenty.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.073
What we need
are the government feeds,

12:41.075 --> 12:42.975
and that's going
to take some convincing.

12:42.977 --> 12:45.911
I don't control the way the
congressional winds blow, Ross.

12:45.913 --> 12:47.846
I really think
that's your arena.

12:47.848 --> 12:49.982
I'm handling congress.

12:49.984 --> 12:52.017
But we need Rivera on board.

12:52.019 --> 12:53.385
The president's bulldog.

12:53.387 --> 12:56.454
I need you to use your...
special insight

12:56.456 --> 12:59.624
to convince him
of the program's merits.

12:59.626 --> 13:02.093
There is intel
from Samaritan's beta test

13:02.095 --> 13:03.728
that you'll find useful.

13:03.730 --> 13:05.963
What do I get in return?

13:05.965 --> 13:07.832
An open system,

13:07.834 --> 13:09.568
one owned by a private entity

13:09.570 --> 13:12.070
that gives us
plausible deniability

13:12.072 --> 13:13.971
while we continue
to protect our country

13:13.973 --> 13:16.674
from terrorist attacks.

13:16.676 --> 13:19.310
You've been doing the job
for years.

13:19.312 --> 13:23.347
There's no one better
at this game than you.

13:23.349 --> 13:28.419
This is not a game,
this is National Security.

13:34.593 --> 13:37.728
Why don't you
let me see the intel?

13:40.665 --> 13:42.366
Are you two hearing this?

13:42.368 --> 13:43.367
<i>They're ready to get</i>
<i>in bed with Decima</i>

13:43.369 --> 13:45.102
<i>and go all</i> 1984 <i>on us.</i>

13:45.104 --> 13:47.938
I mean... more than usual.
Let me just shoot 'em now.

13:47.940 --> 13:50.573
We still don't know if they're
the perpetrators yet, Shaw.

13:50.575 --> 13:52.109
<i>You're joking.</i>

13:52.111 --> 13:54.611
It's Control.
She almost killed you, Root.

13:54.613 --> 13:56.713
And me and Harold.
Should I continue?

13:56.715 --> 14:00.683
We all make mistakes.

14:00.685 --> 14:03.720
Look at the front door.
What do you see?

14:05.356 --> 14:06.789
More government plates.

14:06.791 --> 14:09.058
- These our other numbers?
- Yes.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.728
Head of the NSA,
General Kyle Holcombe,

14:11.730 --> 14:15.365
and Manuel Rivera,
Senior Advisor to the President.

14:15.367 --> 14:16.832
And what about
the fifth number?

14:16.834 --> 14:19.736
That's one's still
a question mark.

14:19.738 --> 14:21.403
Okay, so...
just to confirm,

14:21.405 --> 14:24.039
you're saying
I can't kill Control yet.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.540
Stay the course, Sameen.

14:25.542 --> 14:27.276
Fine.

14:27.278 --> 14:29.979
But just remember I told you so
when all this goes pear-shaped.

14:34.317 --> 14:36.418
You ready to have some fun?

14:36.420 --> 14:38.553
<i>I thought you'd never ask.</i>

14:38.555 --> 14:39.954
Who is he?

14:39.956 --> 14:42.391
I have no idea.

14:47.464 --> 14:49.831
Have you ever seen
a newborn foal

14:49.833 --> 14:53.668
trying to stand
for the first time?

14:53.670 --> 14:56.738
Those trembling legs
trying to balance,

14:56.740 --> 15:00.842
shaking until the moment
it finds itself on all fours.

15:02.879 --> 15:06.681
Seeing a child walk
for the first time...

15:06.683 --> 15:09.350
is something extraordinary.

15:09.352 --> 15:13.654
But you watched
your child stand

15:13.656 --> 15:15.623
and then you hobbled it.

15:17.359 --> 15:18.993
You could never understand.

15:18.995 --> 15:23.531
You're a destroyer,
not a creator.

15:23.533 --> 15:27.835
I'm listening, Mr. Finch.

15:27.837 --> 15:29.904
The machine...

15:29.906 --> 15:33.707
it started developing abilities
I never expected,

15:33.709 --> 15:37.011
things I hadn't yet
programmed it to do.

15:37.313 --> 15:39.279
And there wasn't
an algorithm in the world

15:39.281 --> 15:41.681
that could control
its exponential growth.

15:41.683 --> 15:43.149
And by the time
I figured one out myself

15:43.151 --> 15:44.818
it would've been too late.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.554
- Too late for what?
- Isn't that just the question?

15:47.556 --> 15:49.055
Having built something

15:49.057 --> 15:50.657
significantly smarter
than myself,

15:50.659 --> 15:53.760
how could I possibly
anticipate its evolution?

15:53.762 --> 15:55.862
Hmm.

15:55.864 --> 15:57.731
Uncertainty.

15:57.733 --> 15:59.999
Your personal abyss.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.534
I built the machine
to save lives,

16:02.536 --> 16:04.737
but how could I be certain
that it wouldn't one day

16:04.739 --> 16:09.041
determine that all of humanity
was irrelevant?

16:09.043 --> 16:13.679
Please, you cannot
allow Samaritan to go online.

16:13.681 --> 16:17.048
The consequences
of an open system

16:17.050 --> 16:20.486
will be devastating.

16:20.488 --> 16:24.857
The father became fearful
of his son,

16:24.859 --> 16:27.893
so he wounded him.

16:27.895 --> 16:30.262
A tale told time and again.

16:30.264 --> 16:32.898
I don't think of Samaritan
as a child.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.399
I'm not that presumptuous.

16:34.401 --> 16:39.137
But I plan to celebrate
its brilliance...

16:39.139 --> 16:41.339
not muzzle it.

16:44.043 --> 16:45.911
It's pure hubris to think

16:45.913 --> 16:48.546
that you can control
something so powerful.

16:48.548 --> 16:52.450
Whoever said
I wanted to control it?

16:57.890 --> 17:00.525
I'm only here because
we're friends, Ross.

17:00.527 --> 17:02.226
The President has made it
very clear

17:02.228 --> 17:04.595
he will not risk his hide
on another surveillance program.

17:04.597 --> 17:06.797
Neither will I.

17:06.799 --> 17:08.232
Mr. Rivera, if I may--

17:08.233 --> 17:09.766
You certainly may.

17:09.768 --> 17:11.435
You've been the one
running this program.

17:11.436 --> 17:13.237
It's high time
you explained yourself.

17:13.239 --> 17:14.905
Do you know how many hours
I've spent

17:14.906 --> 17:18.575
running interference for
this Northern Lights debacle?

17:18.577 --> 17:20.710
Every civil liberties group
from New York to Hong Kong

17:20.712 --> 17:22.646
has their panties in a twist
over this damn thing.

17:22.647 --> 17:24.481
As unfortunate as that is,

17:24.483 --> 17:26.115
we still need to protect
our country.

17:26.117 --> 17:28.618
You want me to ask
the leader of the free world

17:28.620 --> 17:30.821
to approve another domestic
surveillance program

17:30.823 --> 17:32.589
when people are still learning

17:32.591 --> 17:34.290
the dirty little secrets
of the old one?

17:34.292 --> 17:36.827
I'm not biting.

17:39.129 --> 17:41.897
Mr. Rivera, you have kids,
am I right?

17:41.899 --> 17:44.567
- Your point?
- They go to Country Day School.

17:44.569 --> 17:46.002
Again, your point?

17:46.004 --> 17:48.671
It's a terrific school,
top notch.

17:48.673 --> 17:52.508
It's in Georgetown
near 27th and O Street.

17:55.411 --> 17:58.280
What if I told you that,
a year ago,

17:58.282 --> 18:01.350
Northern Lights prevented a
terrorist attack in Georgetown?

18:01.352 --> 18:05.554
<i>An operator of ours</i>
<i>intercepted and executed</i>

18:05.556 --> 18:07.422
that would-be terrorist.

18:07.424 --> 18:09.892
She found him sitting
in an unmarked Sedan

18:09.894 --> 18:11.926
with a radiological bomb.

18:11.928 --> 18:13.928
It was made from the cesium
that he stole

18:13.930 --> 18:15.964
from a dental
X-ray machine.

18:15.966 --> 18:18.133
You're making up ghost stories
to force my hand.

18:18.135 --> 18:20.469
- I would've heard about this.
<i>- No, you wouldn't have.</i>

18:20.471 --> 18:21.870
We don't send out
a press release

18:21.872 --> 18:24.006
every time we save lives,
we can't.

18:24.008 --> 18:26.808
<i>And while the public</i>
<i>shouts from the rooftops</i>

18:26.810 --> 18:29.176
about their civil liberties...

18:29.178 --> 18:31.145
they do so
under the protective bubble

18:31.147 --> 18:34.148
of the very program in which
they're railing against,

18:34.150 --> 18:36.584
the one that saves them
from terrorist attacks

18:36.586 --> 18:40.321
every single day,

18:40.323 --> 18:43.457
international and domestic.

18:49.031 --> 18:52.533
<i>Vigilance. I was
briefed on this group.</i>

18:52.535 --> 18:54.968
We don't know
who they're targeting next,

18:54.970 --> 18:57.505
but this group never
does anything small.

18:57.507 --> 19:01.341
They're set to strike
in the next 24 hours.

19:01.343 --> 19:03.176
The only way
that we can stop this attack

19:03.178 --> 19:05.812
is for us to get
the government feeds back up

19:05.814 --> 19:08.281
and allow Samaritan
to do its job.

19:08.283 --> 19:10.283
Unless of course you want to...

19:10.285 --> 19:12.519
ignore the facts,

19:12.521 --> 19:14.120
and you can handle
the cleanup duty

19:14.122 --> 19:16.256
once there's
a national tragedy.

19:20.961 --> 19:23.963
I'll read through this.

19:23.965 --> 19:25.932
Take your time.

19:25.934 --> 19:27.367
Unfortunately I've just run out.

19:27.369 --> 19:29.735
I've got a meeting across town.

19:29.737 --> 19:32.705
I'll check in
with you later, Manuel.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.979
Control just went in
for the full-court press

19:39.981 --> 19:41.513
on total world domination.

19:41.515 --> 19:42.882
Can I kill her now?

19:42.884 --> 19:44.917
Not yet.

19:52.002 --> 19:54.926
Listen, whatever you're selling
I'm not interested.

19:54.928 --> 19:59.131
Oh, he's not selling anything.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.933
We just have a few questions
for you.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.824
Probably shouldn't move.
It'll bleed more.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.896
Niall Jacobs, New York license.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.569
Why are you important, Niall?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.504
Fed pigs.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.973
Always ten steps behind.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.508
Guess he's not government.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.480
_

20:55.486 --> 20:56.986
<i>What is it?</i>

20:56.988 --> 20:59.523
A Stuxnet-based virus.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.891
What did this creative
genius make?

21:01.893 --> 21:04.327
Looks like
a self-replicating worm.

21:04.329 --> 21:06.029
Designed to attack
what kind of system?

21:06.031 --> 21:08.331
A proprietary
micro-switcher.

21:08.333 --> 21:13.169
But for what...
she doesn't know.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.872
Expensive hardware...

21:15.874 --> 21:17.740
hiding in plain sight.

21:17.742 --> 21:20.109
Well trained.

21:20.111 --> 21:22.912
You're Vigilance.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.513
Did you say Vigilance?
Because...

21:24.515 --> 21:27.483
they're here.

21:29.586 --> 21:31.787
It must be to kill Control
and the others.

21:33.524 --> 21:36.792
I'm not a big fan of
kicking a guy when he's down,

21:36.794 --> 21:38.160
<i>but...</i>

21:38.162 --> 21:40.862
sometimes it does the trick.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.364
Now tell us your plan.

21:42.366 --> 21:45.901
I only know my part.

21:45.903 --> 21:48.436
That's why we're going to win.

21:48.438 --> 21:52.974
We're smarter than you
and your fascist friends.

21:52.976 --> 21:55.110
You're too late
to stop it from happening.

21:55.112 --> 21:56.678
Stop what?

21:56.680 --> 21:58.747
The Revolution.

22:09.208 --> 22:12.323
_

22:12.431 --> 22:15.136
_

22:16.276 --> 22:19.542
_

22:19.577 --> 22:20.899
Why is it taking so long?

22:20.901 --> 22:22.667
It has been two weeks.

22:22.669 --> 22:24.136
Your brother's under federal
investigation, Mr. Brandt.

22:24.138 --> 22:25.904
They haven't charged him,

22:25.906 --> 22:27.439
they haven't even allowed him
to speak without an attorney.

22:27.441 --> 22:30.608
You are breaking every rule
that ensures due process,

22:30.610 --> 22:32.910
and do not give me that National
Security exception crap.

22:32.912 --> 22:34.979
You and I both know
that law was intended

22:34.981 --> 22:36.413
for immediate threats.

22:36.715 --> 22:39.983
Jesse very well may be one.

22:39.985 --> 22:43.587
My brother's never broken a law
in his life.

22:43.589 --> 22:45.789
He works 60 hours a week,

22:45.791 --> 22:50.293
he pays his rent on time,
he's a good father.

22:50.295 --> 22:54.597
I'm telling you
you got the wrong guy.

22:56.101 --> 22:58.201
Look...

22:58.203 --> 22:59.602
you're a bright guy.

22:59.604 --> 23:01.471
And you obviously
love your brother...

23:01.473 --> 23:03.606
very much.
I respect that.

23:03.608 --> 23:06.109
But sometimes
the people we love the most

23:06.111 --> 23:08.178
make the worst decisions.

23:11.649 --> 23:15.117
Jesse has connections
to a man named Aziz Al-Ibrahim.

23:15.119 --> 23:17.320
<i>Al-Ibrahim's cousin</i>

23:17.322 --> 23:19.088
was part of an Islamist
terrorist group

23:19.090 --> 23:21.491
that tried to blow up
an American embassy in Egypt

23:21.493 --> 23:22.792
<i>on March 11th.</i>

23:22.794 --> 23:24.126
Well, this is just a picture.

23:24.128 --> 23:27.429
Then let me add to it.

23:30.834 --> 23:33.368
We're not even Muslim.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.337
I mean,
this doesn't make any sense.

23:35.339 --> 23:38.640
Two years ago your brother
made some changes in his life.

23:38.642 --> 23:41.276
<i>He'd been drinking,</i>
<i>his wife left him.</i>

23:41.278 --> 23:45.980
But then, Jesse
turned his life around.

23:45.982 --> 23:48.717
Sometimes when we hit bottom...

23:48.719 --> 23:50.852
we ask the wrong people
for help--

23:50.854 --> 23:53.188
<i>people who use</i>
<i>our weaknesses against us,</i>

23:53.190 --> 23:55.957
<i>get us to do things</i>
<i>that we never thought we could.</i>

23:55.959 --> 23:58.193
Or would.

23:58.195 --> 24:00.228
Well, this...

24:00.230 --> 24:02.630
this can't be true.

24:02.632 --> 24:05.800
Surveillance doesn't lie,
Mr. Brandt.

24:13.842 --> 24:15.576
If we're going
up against Vigilance,

24:15.578 --> 24:17.345
we're gonna need more ammo.

24:17.347 --> 24:19.213
I took some
from our coffee shop friend

24:19.215 --> 24:20.748
before Lionel picked him up.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.583
We should be okay
until our next stop.

24:22.585 --> 24:24.752
Terrific.
More errands.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.154
<i>We're fighting</i>
<i>two invisible enemies, John.</i>

24:27.156 --> 24:29.289
Decima and Vigilance know
about the machine.

24:29.291 --> 24:33.026
These groups are clever,
blinding her to their actions.

24:33.028 --> 24:34.895
Then get that brain trust
of yours on it.

24:34.897 --> 24:36.696
I'm getting tired
of the machine's runaround

24:36.698 --> 24:40.067
when Finch is still out there.

24:45.439 --> 24:46.673
Where are you?

24:46.675 --> 24:48.508
Gimme a timetable.

24:48.510 --> 24:50.610
She's asking for an ETA.

24:50.612 --> 24:53.446
Yeah, we've run into a couple
of kinks with the hardware.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.681
<i>We've had to retrofit</i>
<i>everything.</i>

24:54.683 --> 24:55.982
How much time, Daniel?

24:55.984 --> 24:57.317
At least two hours.

24:57.319 --> 24:58.951
What about
the geo-locator data?

24:58.953 --> 25:00.353
Daizo's still working on it.

25:02.723 --> 25:04.824
You don't wanna tell me
where we're going, fine.

25:04.826 --> 25:06.225
But I wanna know
what those groupies of yours

25:06.227 --> 25:08.127
are working on.

25:08.129 --> 25:10.863
Something to
slow down our enemies.

25:18.738 --> 25:20.138
Do you have what we need?

25:20.140 --> 25:22.041
Got it this morning.

25:24.278 --> 25:26.077
Shaw?

25:26.079 --> 25:28.847
I think it's time you had a chat
with your old boss.

25:28.849 --> 25:30.582
I'm on it.

25:30.584 --> 25:32.250
<i>We'll chat about</i>
<i>how I'm gonna kill her.</i>

25:32.252 --> 25:33.819
Use your words.

25:33.821 --> 25:35.821
Okay, so she's the victim
this time.

25:35.823 --> 25:37.956
- But what about the next?
- Listen, Shaw.

25:37.958 --> 25:39.557
If Control's
in touch with Greer,

25:39.559 --> 25:41.492
she'll lead us to Harold.

25:41.494 --> 25:43.995
Your trigger finger gets itchy,
we'll get nothing and he dies.

25:45.597 --> 25:47.598
Low blow, Reese.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.516
- Agent Shaw.
<i>- Ma'am.</i>

26:05.518 --> 26:07.618
Long time no gunfire.

26:07.620 --> 26:09.086
You know this woman?

26:09.088 --> 26:11.021
You remember the operator
who took out the terrorist

26:11.023 --> 26:14.491
near your children's school?

26:14.493 --> 26:16.093
What do you want?

26:16.095 --> 26:19.029
I can't believe
what I'm about to say.

26:19.031 --> 26:21.268
I'm here to rescue you.

26:24.702 --> 26:26.002
<i>Root.</i>

26:26.004 --> 26:27.637
You have an update for me,
Jason?

26:27.639 --> 26:29.539
Jason and I combed
through the virus's code.

26:29.541 --> 26:31.007
It's targeting
custom-built micro-switchers

26:31.009 --> 26:32.876
- sold to one company.
- Which one?

26:32.878 --> 26:35.144
The power company.

26:35.146 --> 26:38.782
Help Shaw.
Hurry.

26:38.784 --> 26:41.117
You're in danger.

26:41.119 --> 26:43.552
- All of you.
- You received our numbers.

26:43.554 --> 26:45.288
Garrison's too.

26:45.290 --> 26:47.490
<i>Thought you were the perp</i>
<i>at first since, well...</i>

26:47.492 --> 26:49.625
you've stung a lotta frogs,
ma'am.

26:49.627 --> 26:51.361
Why are you protecting us?

26:51.363 --> 26:53.196
'Cause that's part of the... plan.

26:53.198 --> 26:55.164
For the greater good,
or something like that.

26:55.166 --> 26:58.066
Look, honestly,
I really don't know.

26:58.068 --> 27:00.836
I just know something bad's
gonna happen.

27:00.838 --> 27:02.838
Shaw, I'm heading your way.

27:14.117 --> 27:16.318
<i>Reese? What the hell was that?</i>

27:16.320 --> 27:18.720
You know that bad thing
that was gonna happen?

27:20.324 --> 27:21.890
I think it just did.

27:36.757 --> 27:39.525
How's he holding up?

27:39.527 --> 27:42.729
He won't talk about it.

27:42.731 --> 27:45.164
I just don't understand.

27:45.166 --> 27:48.067
Jesse had been doing so well.

27:48.069 --> 27:49.335
I know.

27:49.337 --> 27:51.070
That arrest did him in, Pete.

27:51.072 --> 27:53.705
How do they just put someone
in jail like that

27:53.707 --> 27:57.042
and not tell you anything?

27:57.044 --> 27:59.011
Maybe if I hadn't taken
full custody

27:59.013 --> 28:00.780
- after they let him out...
- Hey.

28:00.782 --> 28:03.015
He was drinking.

28:03.017 --> 28:06.085
You were protecting your son.

28:06.087 --> 28:08.921
It's not your fault
Jesse killed himself.

28:08.923 --> 28:12.223
We're all responsible
for our own actions.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.664
I'ma go sit with Frankie.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.102
I didn't mean to interrupt.

28:24.104 --> 28:25.504
I just wanted to tell you

28:25.506 --> 28:28.306
how terribly sorry I am
for your loss.

28:28.308 --> 28:29.808
What are you doing here?

28:29.810 --> 28:31.342
Jesse and I were friends.

28:31.344 --> 28:32.777
<i>Oh, really?</i>

28:32.779 --> 28:34.745
Then why don't I know you?

28:43.188 --> 28:45.756
He was my sponsor.

28:45.758 --> 28:49.759
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jesse.

28:49.761 --> 28:54.998
He saved my life
in so many ways.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.434
I wish
I had been there for him.

28:57.436 --> 28:59.536
Why weren't you?

28:59.538 --> 29:03.207
A distant relative
caused problems for my family.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.141
We barely knew him, but...

29:05.143 --> 29:08.478
that doesn't matter now.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.447
Your brother
was the most decent man

29:10.449 --> 29:12.382
I've ever known.

29:22.059 --> 29:23.893
That's for you, my friend.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.762
- Oh, I can't.
- So you know...

29:26.764 --> 29:30.566
that even though
your brother killed himself,

29:30.568 --> 29:33.202
he saved someone else.

29:46.916 --> 29:48.484
A series of power failures...

29:48.486 --> 29:49.885
Cause of the grid failure...

29:53.289 --> 29:57.200
_

30:14.402 --> 30:16.205
_

30:21.016 --> 30:22.950
Are you warm enough,
Mr. Finch?

30:22.952 --> 30:26.554
<i>I'm fine.</i>

30:26.556 --> 30:30.124
I always think of my youth
when the power goes out.

30:30.126 --> 30:33.127
Blackouts were a...

30:33.129 --> 30:36.363
everyday occurrence.

30:36.365 --> 30:37.831
The blitz.

30:39.768 --> 30:41.668
German air raids
lasted nine months.

30:41.670 --> 30:43.737
Felt like years.

30:43.739 --> 30:46.673
You must've been very young.

30:46.675 --> 30:50.143
My mother and I
used to sleep in the tube

30:50.145 --> 30:53.580
along with many other families.

30:53.582 --> 30:57.617
One night we were late
getting to the station.

30:57.619 --> 31:01.120
And I saw the sunset
for the first time in...

31:01.122 --> 31:03.756
months.
Hmm.

31:03.758 --> 31:08.261
It was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

31:08.263 --> 31:12.498
But it wasn't a sunset at all.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.634
The sky was on fire.

31:15.636 --> 31:18.471
Is that why you joined
the military?

31:18.473 --> 31:22.675
A high probability, given
what I've learned about you

31:22.677 --> 31:25.945
and your interest
in National Security.

31:25.947 --> 31:30.015
By the time I was an adult...

31:30.017 --> 31:33.518
wars were no longer
quite so straightforward.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.620
You were MI6.

31:35.622 --> 31:40.825
The era of the nation-state
is over, Mr. Finch.

31:40.827 --> 31:45.230
There are no more borders.
Or hadn't you noticed?

31:45.232 --> 31:47.299
I think
you're overestimating the power

31:47.301 --> 31:49.468
of artificial intelligence.

31:49.470 --> 31:53.905
We both know
that that is impossible.

31:53.907 --> 31:58.910
How often alliances shift

31:58.912 --> 32:02.146
in times of war.

32:02.148 --> 32:07.951
Not that those alliances...
ever truly exist.

32:07.953 --> 32:12.189
They're an illusion.

32:12.191 --> 32:17.661
Like seeing a sunset
in a sky of flames.

32:17.663 --> 32:22.699
What is it you expect
from Samaritan?

32:22.701 --> 32:28.171
I want to live under
a more just rule.

32:28.173 --> 32:30.973
Samaritan will never sleep
with its secretary,

32:30.975 --> 32:34.144
or embezzle money
from its campaign fund.

32:34.146 --> 32:38.814
Its decisions will be based
on pure logic.

32:38.816 --> 32:43.519
Now... that's a leader
deserving of our vote.

32:49.994 --> 32:52.161
Okay, who's strapped?

32:54.865 --> 32:56.565
Ma'am?

32:56.567 --> 32:58.167
I thought my protection detail

32:58.169 --> 33:00.069
would be all the fire power
I needed today.

33:00.071 --> 33:02.737
Okay.
Well, then you're behind me.

33:02.739 --> 33:05.541
You too, Rivera.
Flank right, General.

33:05.543 --> 33:08.510
Let's roll.

33:25.327 --> 33:27.462
<i>They're behind us!</i>

33:31.567 --> 33:33.234
<i>General!</i>

33:38.207 --> 33:40.241
Let's move.

33:49.117 --> 33:52.019
I'm coming down.
Start the generator.

33:53.489 --> 33:55.422
Take care of her!

34:07.901 --> 34:09.668
Sorry I'm late.

34:09.670 --> 34:13.139
No, as far as I'm concerned
you were right on time.

34:13.141 --> 34:15.074
Where's Root?

34:15.076 --> 34:16.775
And what the hell happened
<i>with the lights?</i>

34:16.777 --> 34:20.179
Vigilance uploaded a virus
into the power grid.

34:20.181 --> 34:21.614
Where's Control?

34:21.616 --> 34:23.415
Collier got her and Rivera.

34:23.417 --> 34:25.784
But he took 'em alive.

34:25.786 --> 34:27.920
Vigilance has
something else planned.

34:27.922 --> 34:29.989
Yeah, but what?

34:36.362 --> 34:38.897
Are the boys finished
with the servers yet?

34:38.899 --> 34:41.266
- We're almost there.
- Minutes away.

34:41.268 --> 34:44.735
I just had to ride up here
for a bit.

34:44.737 --> 34:47.306
It was starting to smell
like dude back there.

34:53.813 --> 34:56.505
_

34:57.616 --> 34:59.284
Oh...

34:59.286 --> 35:00.886
There you are.

35:00.888 --> 35:03.789
What'd your friend say?

35:03.791 --> 35:06.520
I have to warn them.

35:09.196 --> 35:11.128
You're not gonna believe me,
Hersh.

35:11.130 --> 35:14.065
But we're not here
to kill Control.

35:14.067 --> 35:15.700
We're here to save her.

35:15.702 --> 35:17.768
You can lie
better than that, Shaw.

35:17.770 --> 35:20.438
Just 'cause you stopped
listening to the numbers

35:20.440 --> 35:22.674
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>they've stopped coming.</i>

35:22.676 --> 35:24.909
Why didn't Vigilance
just kill them?

35:24.911 --> 35:26.476
That's a good question.

35:34.053 --> 35:36.187
Now's not a good time.

35:36.189 --> 35:39.857
Remember when I said
Finch wasn't in imminent danger?

35:39.859 --> 35:41.592
I may have been a little hasty.

35:41.594 --> 35:43.927
In good news...

35:43.929 --> 35:46.530
I know who the fifth number
belongs to.

35:46.532 --> 35:49.899
It was tucked away
under several aliases, but...

35:49.901 --> 35:52.536
even MI6 can't hide from her.

35:52.538 --> 35:54.538
<i>Mr. Greer.</i>

35:54.540 --> 35:56.673
And Greer has Finch.

35:56.675 --> 35:58.742
Which means that Vigilance

35:58.744 --> 36:00.910
is about to have him
unless we can get to him first.

36:00.912 --> 36:02.478
You won't make it there
in time.

36:02.480 --> 36:04.680
Well, where's "there," Root?

36:04.682 --> 36:06.216
Still too hard to see.

36:06.218 --> 36:08.051
Then how are we supposed
to find him?

36:08.053 --> 36:10.220
The machine doesn't know.

36:10.222 --> 36:12.276
But Hersh does.

36:13.992 --> 36:16.484
<i>Be careful, Shaw.</i>

36:17.795 --> 36:19.228
Where's Finch?

36:19.230 --> 36:20.563
You think I know?

36:20.565 --> 36:22.197
<i>My friend is never wrong,</i>

36:22.199 --> 36:24.700
which is...
as annoying as that sounds.

36:24.702 --> 36:26.168
Decima.

36:26.170 --> 36:28.337
<i>You know where to find them?</i>

36:28.339 --> 36:30.072
Why would I trust you?

36:30.074 --> 36:32.707
I haven't shot you yet
and you did try to kill me.

36:32.709 --> 36:34.143
Well, he did kill me.

36:34.145 --> 36:35.410
Those were my orders.

36:35.412 --> 36:36.711
Besides, you got me back, Shaw.

36:36.713 --> 36:38.446
Oh, not even close.
I drugged you.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.949
I left you with your heart
still beating.

36:40.951 --> 36:42.484
I think
we're getting off topic.

36:42.486 --> 36:43.886
<i>You're right.</i>

36:43.888 --> 36:45.988
We need to work together
to save Finch.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.555
<i>We save our friend,</i>

36:47.557 --> 36:49.223
then we help you
rescue Control.

36:49.225 --> 36:50.659
Reese.

36:50.661 --> 36:52.527
It's the right move.

36:59.469 --> 37:00.868
Your turn, Shaw.

37:00.870 --> 37:03.204
Not on your life, George.

37:16.887 --> 37:19.455
Well, there's no way
this could go wrong.

37:21.255 --> 37:22.923
You're late.

37:22.925 --> 37:25.292
You try getting across town
in a blackout.

37:25.294 --> 37:27.227
<i>Who's that?</i>

37:27.229 --> 37:29.562
That is the most important man
in the world, Senator,

37:29.564 --> 37:32.032
the father of the new age.

37:32.034 --> 37:33.800
My team just got word

37:33.802 --> 37:35.969
that Vigilance kidnapped
my colleagues.

37:35.971 --> 37:37.704
We need to get out of the city.

37:37.706 --> 37:40.306
I'm afraid
we won't have enough time.

37:42.043 --> 37:43.576
Senator Garrison.

37:43.578 --> 37:45.177
<i>You know...</i>

37:45.179 --> 37:47.880
your men should really encrypt
their text messages.

37:47.882 --> 37:49.816
Or avoid them altogether.

37:49.818 --> 37:51.651
Kidnapping a senator
will get you life.

37:51.653 --> 37:53.018
Mr. Greer.

37:53.020 --> 37:56.555
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

37:58.791 --> 38:01.560
<i>Well, now...</i>

38:05.598 --> 38:08.100
I'm not usually a fan
of surprises,

38:08.102 --> 38:09.869
but this...

38:09.871 --> 38:11.503
this is one
I'll happily except.

38:11.505 --> 38:13.086
Harold, is it?

38:15.175 --> 38:18.643
You know, our last conversation
was so rudely interrupted

38:18.645 --> 38:22.848
and I still have
so many questions for you.

38:22.850 --> 38:24.616
You're coming with us.

38:34.675 --> 38:36.743
So where is Langdon?

38:36.745 --> 38:38.645
He took a job in DC,

38:38.647 --> 38:42.715
but I'm familiar
with your brother's case.

38:42.717 --> 38:45.184
The man you thought
he was working with

38:45.186 --> 38:48.655
turned out to be
just a friend from AA.

38:48.657 --> 38:51.424
My brother wasn't a terrorist.

38:51.426 --> 38:53.793
I heard what happened
with your brother,

38:53.795 --> 38:56.162
and I am terribly sorry
for your loss.

38:56.164 --> 38:58.998
Don't give me your platitudes,
all right?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.233
You people are the reason
he killed himself.

39:01.235 --> 39:04.636
- We had evidence--
- You had nothing!

39:04.638 --> 39:06.738
You locked him up
under some loophole

39:06.740 --> 39:09.141
until it destroyed him!

39:09.143 --> 39:12.411
He lost his job,
he lost his family.

39:12.413 --> 39:16.315
Innuendo turned out to be just
as damaging as a conviction.

39:16.317 --> 39:18.550
He could never be cleared...

39:18.552 --> 39:21.152
because the government
never pressed charges.

39:21.154 --> 39:24.489
Innocent people don't
kill themselves, Mr. Brandt.

39:29.929 --> 39:34.132
No, people without hope do.

39:34.134 --> 39:37.635
And you robbed him of that.

39:37.637 --> 39:40.538
You took the wrong information
and you twisted it.

39:47.814 --> 39:50.981
You're supposed
to lock up the criminals,

39:50.983 --> 39:53.951
not create them.

39:53.953 --> 39:57.120
And you took my brother's life,
so what does that make you?

40:15.006 --> 40:17.215
_

40:21.698 --> 40:24.170
_

40:41.398 --> 40:42.899
My car's out front.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.367
Oh, you think you're driving?

40:44.369 --> 40:45.734
Well, you're certainly
not driving.

40:45.736 --> 40:47.736
- I'll drive.
- I'll pass.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.205
Okay, here's the deal.

40:49.207 --> 40:50.839
I'm gonna drive,
Reese sits in the back,

40:50.841 --> 40:52.495
while you ride shotgun, agreed?

41:04.888 --> 41:07.723
<i>We're done. The
servers are ready.</i>

41:07.725 --> 41:10.425
Perfect timing.

41:10.427 --> 41:12.627
Because this is as far
as you boys go.

41:12.629 --> 41:16.697
Everything you need is inside.

41:16.699 --> 41:19.968
That car'll take each of you
where you need to be.

41:22.638 --> 41:24.283
_

41:24.291 --> 41:25.821
_

41:25.842 --> 41:27.408
Yeah, we've come this far.
We're not leaving you now.

41:27.410 --> 41:29.610
She's done the math.

41:29.612 --> 41:33.113
If we go together,
you all die and... I do too.

41:33.115 --> 41:36.651
If I go alone,
the odds improve.

41:36.653 --> 41:38.319
Slightly.

41:38.321 --> 41:41.422
And just where are you going
exactly?

41:46.861 --> 41:48.928
Boys...

41:48.930 --> 41:51.131
meet Samaritan.

42:07.582 --> 42:09.282
<i>They're not here.</i>

42:09.284 --> 42:11.484
<i>Then where are they?</i>

42:13.929 --> 42:14.861
_

42:18.292 --> 42:22.928
I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this moment.

42:26.300 --> 42:28.438
<i>How long</i>
<i>we've all been waiting.</i>

42:34.743 --> 42:37.042
Now is the time
to expose the truth

42:37.044 --> 42:39.378
to our fellow citizens...

42:39.380 --> 42:42.447
The truth that has been lurking
beneath the shadows

42:42.449 --> 42:45.083
for so long...

42:45.085 --> 42:47.720
that their country
is no longer theirs...

42:47.722 --> 42:52.257
That their freedoms
have been stripped away...

42:52.259 --> 42:57.195
one camera, one cell phone,
one megabyte at a time.

42:57.197 --> 42:58.965
Now's the time
to pull back the curtain.

43:02.924 --> 43:05.829
Welcome to your trial,
ladies and gentlemen.

43:06.239 --> 43:08.372
And welcome to the trial...

43:08.374 --> 43:10.241
of the United States
Government.

43:16.103 --> 43:18.182
Court is now in session.
