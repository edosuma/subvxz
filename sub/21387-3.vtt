WEBVTT

00:05.372 --> 00:06.372
-So who initiated the sex?
-Him...

00:06.372 --> 00:07.663
-Have y'all spoken since?
-It's unclear.

00:07.663 --> 00:09.580
Bitch, are you a magic 8-ball?
What's that mean?!

00:10.206 --> 00:11.497
Does that mean he broke up
with that girl?

00:11.497 --> 00:13.705
-What... What girl?
-I think her name is Tasha.

00:13.705 --> 00:15.997
ISSA DEE: It's not about her.
And I don't wanna be petty.

00:16.830 --> 00:18.622
-(KNOCKING)
-Cannot sleep here!

00:19.081 --> 00:21.497
Tasha, I slept with my ex.
It was a mistake,

00:21.497 --> 00:22.705
and you don't deserve that.

00:23.122 --> 00:25.497
The apartment has
two bedrooms, one bath...

00:25.497 --> 00:27.122
You hear that Brian McKnight?
Two bedrooms.

00:27.122 --> 00:28.997
One for you to sleep in,
and one for your feelings.

00:29.413 --> 00:31.164
I know as black women
it can feel like there's

00:31.164 --> 00:32.497
a lot of things stacked
against us.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.663
It's a all-boys club.
Whatever I got to do to get in,

00:34.872 --> 00:36.039
I'll just figure it out.

00:36.789 --> 00:39.081
MOLLY CARTER: (ON PHONE)
Just talked to Lawrence.
He found a new apartment.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.497
Lawrence said that he's done.

00:40.747 --> 00:42.081
I'm sorry, Iss.

00:50.122 --> 00:51.872
- ( music playing )
- ( Issa and man laughing )

00:51.872 --> 00:53.455
Issa:
Ben, you're so stupid.

00:53.455 --> 00:56.206
- You got a sexy laugh,
you know that?
- Nuh-uh.

00:56.206 --> 00:57.372
Yeah.

01:01.247 --> 01:02.872
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

01:02.872 --> 01:04.039
( moans )

01:05.789 --> 01:08.039
( giggles )
It tickles.

01:08.039 --> 01:10.039
Cool.

01:10.039 --> 01:11.705
( giggles )

01:11.705 --> 01:13.538
I'm sorry.

01:13.538 --> 01:15.497
That's that sexy laugh
you like.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.830
( laughs )

01:20.830 --> 01:22.372
You ain't gotta
keep laughing.

01:22.372 --> 01:23.914
Oh, I know.
That's-- that's
the last time.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.081
( sighs )
Are you--
you all right?

01:31.081 --> 01:32.413
No, I'm-- I'm sorry.

01:32.413 --> 01:36.081
It's just
your fingers are...

01:36.081 --> 01:39.247
It's weird.
It's so weird.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.372
( sighs )

01:42.372 --> 01:44.122
Um, I'm sorry.

01:44.122 --> 01:46.206
Can we-- can we
do this another time?

01:46.206 --> 01:47.747
Uh, I don't know.

01:47.747 --> 01:51.247
I mean,
I kind of thought this
was, like, a sure shot, so.

01:51.247 --> 01:54.247
Yeah, I--
I did, too.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.955
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

01:55.955 --> 01:57.247
( sighs )

01:57.247 --> 01:59.455
You know what?
I'll get out of here.

01:59.455 --> 02:03.122
I can never tell
if it's inside out.

02:03.122 --> 02:05.122
I got this
from the swap meet.

02:05.122 --> 02:07.206
( grunts )
You know what?
I'll just...

02:07.206 --> 02:10.081
Thank you so much
for your hospitality.

02:10.081 --> 02:11.997
- ( door opens )
- Uh, it's your bedroom.

02:11.997 --> 02:13.372
Heh, we didn't
make it there.

02:13.372 --> 02:15.413
( chuckles )

02:56.164 --> 02:58.164
That party
was on, though.

03:02.122 --> 03:04.331
Absolutely.
You know, that sounds
great, Hannah.

03:04.331 --> 03:06.289
And discovery's
complete on Sycamore,

03:06.289 --> 03:09.830
and I e-mailed Merrill
about the summary
judgment motion,

03:09.830 --> 03:12.206
but he hasn't responded.

03:12.206 --> 03:13.663
Well, we all know
how that goes.

03:13.663 --> 03:17.455
Just hang in there.
I have to hop on
another call.

03:17.455 --> 03:19.580
- Quentin, can you
fill Molly in?
- Absolutely.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.830
Molly, I will see you
when you're here next week.

03:21.830 --> 03:23.830
And, look, I gotta
go soon, too.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.413
The sun is actually
shining today

03:25.413 --> 03:26.538
and I'm going
to the beach.

03:26.538 --> 03:27.955
Okay, don't
call it a beach.

03:27.955 --> 03:29.830
You know
it's not the beach.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.538
See, you can get
disbarred here for saying
something like that.

03:32.538 --> 03:35.413
Well, out here,
you can get promoted
for being an asshole, so.

03:35.413 --> 03:36.705
( laughs )

03:36.705 --> 03:38.331
Well, you better not
let them hear you.

03:38.331 --> 03:39.705
( both laughing )

03:41.289 --> 03:43.830
( kids chattering )

03:46.039 --> 03:48.872
( bell rings )

03:48.872 --> 03:50.872
Boy:
Aw, man.
You stupid, fool!

03:50.872 --> 03:51.747
You see this?

03:56.039 --> 03:57.497
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

03:57.497 --> 04:00.039
I've been thinking a lot
about how we can balance

04:00.039 --> 04:02.039
the classroom's
demographics.

04:02.039 --> 04:04.914
Wait, what?
Demographics?

04:04.914 --> 04:07.997
We're finally getting
consistent numbers.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.955
Yeah, but the numbers
are all...

04:11.747 --> 04:13.580
they're black.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.747
Is this
the Gotcha thing?

04:15.747 --> 04:18.247
Yes, it is!
Welcome.

04:18.247 --> 04:19.914
If you need
a place to study

04:19.914 --> 04:21.580
or you need tutoring...

04:21.580 --> 04:23.997
Mr. Gaines sent us.
He said you had
extra space.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.663
Yes, we do.
But do you have
any friends

04:26.663 --> 04:30.039
or, like,
amigos, amigas?

04:30.039 --> 04:32.331
Okay, listen,
why don't you find a seat

04:32.331 --> 04:34.580
and we'll be by in a few
to see how we can help.

04:34.580 --> 04:35.914
All right.

04:38.081 --> 04:40.081
So, Mr. Gaines
is-- is--

04:40.081 --> 04:41.331
Trying to
look out for us?

04:41.331 --> 04:42.955
Yeah!
Yeah, he is!

04:42.955 --> 04:44.247
And at least now

04:44.247 --> 04:46.705
we have students
we can actually help.

04:46.705 --> 04:48.955
It's not that I'm not happy
that we have more kids,

04:48.955 --> 04:51.997
but the school's
86% Latino

04:51.997 --> 04:53.914
and the attendance
doesn't reflect that.

04:53.914 --> 04:56.289
Frieda, we have
to start somewhere,
all right?

04:56.289 --> 04:57.872
I don't know why
you're trying so hard

04:57.872 --> 04:59.580
to turn our success
into failure,

04:59.580 --> 05:01.413
but just take the W!

05:02.955 --> 05:04.914
Hey, you guys good?

05:04.914 --> 05:07.455
- Yeah.
- What are you studying?
What do you need?

05:07.455 --> 05:09.331
( crunching )

05:09.331 --> 05:11.997
( crunching continues )

05:11.997 --> 05:15.039
Colin, enough
with the chips.

05:15.039 --> 05:17.122
They're not chips,
they're Chirps.

05:17.122 --> 05:18.747
- Made from crickets.
- Aparna: I don't care.

05:18.747 --> 05:21.455
You know, I actually tried
crickets once in Phuket.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.747
- They're high in protein.
- You know what else
it's high in?

05:23.747 --> 05:24.955
Fucking crickets.

05:24.955 --> 05:26.247
- ( Aparna snickers )
- Whatever.

05:26.247 --> 05:27.830
I gotta go
take a tinkle.

05:27.830 --> 05:30.331
Is that what he said
after you two...?

05:30.331 --> 05:31.872
Shut up!

05:31.872 --> 05:34.331
- Did you--
- Hook up with a dude
who eats bugs?

05:34.331 --> 05:35.538
Yes, she did.

05:35.538 --> 05:37.538
It was Startup Saturday,
so fuck you.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.830
I don't know
what that is,

05:38.830 --> 05:40.497
but that is not
a good enough excuse.

05:40.497 --> 05:43.081
It's some mixer thing.
Trust me, it's depressing.

05:43.081 --> 05:45.413
All the guys
are disgusting
or lame as shit.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.039
It's true.
You'd freaking clean up.

05:47.039 --> 05:49.413
Uh, yeah,
I don't know
about that.

05:49.413 --> 05:51.413
Actually,
there is another one
this Saturday.

05:51.413 --> 05:53.497
- You should come.
- Yeah, I'd love to,

05:53.497 --> 05:56.830
but I promised someone
that I would pick up
some chairs.

05:58.997 --> 06:00.747
It's for
a family barbecue.

06:00.747 --> 06:03.206
This just keeps
getting sadder.

06:03.206 --> 06:05.164
Next time, though!
Yo, I'm there.

06:06.331 --> 06:08.164
Mm-hmm.

06:08.164 --> 06:09.538
Whatever.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.538
Just use
the note cards, Mom.

06:13.538 --> 06:14.872
You don't have
to memorize the vows.

06:14.872 --> 06:16.538
He's already
married to you.

06:16.538 --> 06:19.413
You can wear your glasses.
Dad knows you wear glasses.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.622
Mom, I have to go.
Mm-hmm, I love you. Bye.

06:24.622 --> 06:26.705
Should I give the bookcase
to him to load?

06:26.705 --> 06:27.997
To who?

06:29.538 --> 06:32.289
Oh, no, he's not--
we're not together.

06:32.289 --> 06:33.872
- I got it.
- It's pretty heavy.

06:33.872 --> 06:35.538
It's cool.
I got it.

06:35.538 --> 06:37.872
( grunts, pops lips )

06:37.872 --> 06:39.622
( exhales )
Okay, um...

06:39.622 --> 06:40.955
Just gonna...

06:40.955 --> 06:42.538
Okay, mm-hmm.

06:42.538 --> 06:44.455
( groans )
Excuse me, do you mind?

06:44.455 --> 06:46.538
Just move it, yeah,
a little bit back further.

06:46.538 --> 06:48.039
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

06:50.039 --> 06:51.663
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:57.247 --> 07:00.164
( sighing )

07:00.164 --> 07:02.247
- Thanks.
- Thanks, man.
Okay, baby.

07:07.247 --> 07:09.122
And...

07:09.122 --> 07:11.872
- All right.
- You wanna drive?

07:11.872 --> 07:14.747
Issa: But, wait,
you're putting therapy
on pause till when?

07:14.747 --> 07:16.455
Till I find
another therapist.

07:16.455 --> 07:18.955
I mean, Dr. Rhonda
was always putting
her shit on me.

07:18.955 --> 07:20.914
( scoffs )
Just because we both
got brown titties.

07:20.914 --> 07:22.164
( chuckles )

07:22.164 --> 07:23.580
Okay, wait.
What?

07:23.580 --> 07:26.914
"Put shelf 25 in 7C"?

07:26.914 --> 07:28.872
- I don't know...
- Hey, girl, you know what?

07:28.872 --> 07:32.789
You do this part
and I will do this part.

07:32.789 --> 07:34.247
But, like,
on the real, though,

07:34.247 --> 07:36.247
you gonna keep
looking, though, right?

07:36.247 --> 07:38.789
'Cause there's plenty
of brown titties
in the sea.

07:38.789 --> 07:39.955
Oh, you got jokes?

07:39.955 --> 07:41.289
( laughs )
Okay.

07:41.289 --> 07:42.538
Because there's plenty
of brown dicks

07:42.538 --> 07:43.830
in the sea, too.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.747
But you ain't got one.
( gasps )

07:45.747 --> 07:48.497
Okay, first of all,
trying to fuck is hard.

07:48.497 --> 07:49.955
No, it's not.
It's like riding a bike.

07:49.955 --> 07:52.164
Yeah, I don't know
how to do that either.

07:52.164 --> 07:54.039
Like, I kept on thinking,
"What if he's not good?

07:54.039 --> 07:56.206
Or what if I'm not good?"

07:56.206 --> 07:58.872
And-- I don't know,
I'm just stuck in my own head.

07:58.872 --> 08:00.538
Well, what you think
therapy is?

08:00.538 --> 08:02.247
I'm stuck in my head
talking to a stranger.

08:02.247 --> 08:04.081
At least you get
the option to fuck
at the end.

08:04.081 --> 08:06.455
Yeah, but you chose
not to be out here.

08:06.455 --> 08:08.164
But it's not like
I don't want somebody.

08:08.164 --> 08:10.122
Then, girl,
get yours.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.580
I should.

08:11.580 --> 08:12.955
We should.

08:12.955 --> 08:15.747
I mean,
we were supposed to do
this ho shit together.

08:15.747 --> 08:17.705
Girl, I always wanted
to have a ho phase.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.580
But then I met Lawrence
and he made me

08:19.580 --> 08:21.206
fall in love with him
and shit.

08:21.206 --> 08:23.789
Tsk, yeah, y'all did
get boo'd up real quick.

08:25.789 --> 08:28.747
You know what?
Fuck love, okay?

08:28.747 --> 08:31.081
Fuck getting to know
these niggas.

08:31.081 --> 08:32.705
Fuck feeling feelings.

08:32.705 --> 08:34.997
I just wanna be
on my Halle Berry shit,
okay?

08:34.997 --> 08:38.039
I just wanna
feel good.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.663
Cool, cool, cool.
Well, can you fuck
with my bookshelf, though?

08:41.663 --> 08:44.331
- Mm.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.

08:44.331 --> 08:46.497
Hey...

08:46.497 --> 08:47.997
let's go somewhere
tonight.

08:49.622 --> 08:51.247
Can you teach me
how to ho?

08:51.247 --> 08:54.122
Bitch, that's rude.

08:54.122 --> 08:55.497
And, yes.

18:27.830 --> 18:31.122
Okay, Eddie.
I see you.

18:31.122 --> 18:33.914
( phone buzzing )

18:38.705 --> 18:40.039
Hey, girl.

18:40.039 --> 18:42.872
- How was your brunch?
- Um, it was good.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.872
Whoa, that was some
high-pitched fakeness.

18:45.872 --> 18:47.247
What you mean?

18:47.247 --> 18:48.955
You don't sound excited
about him.

18:48.955 --> 18:50.122
Lionel is great.

18:50.122 --> 18:51.331
We want a lot
of the same things.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.122
I mean,
he got a five-year plan,

18:53.122 --> 18:56.122
he's attractive, he's smart,
he making money.

18:56.122 --> 18:57.455
But?

18:57.455 --> 18:59.914
But I just don't know
what it is!

18:59.914 --> 19:04.122
It's, like,
on paper, he's amazing,
but I don't know.

19:04.122 --> 19:07.289
- Well, what don't you know?
- It's like with Dro
and Candice.

19:07.289 --> 19:09.289
I just ran into them
at the cupcake shop.

19:09.289 --> 19:10.622
Ooh, which two
did you get?

19:10.622 --> 19:11.663
Bitch, who cares?

19:11.663 --> 19:13.289
Chocolate and caramel?

19:13.289 --> 19:15.206
Yes, but the point is,

19:15.206 --> 19:16.872
like, Dro didn't have
no five-year plan.

19:16.872 --> 19:18.872
Hell, he didn't even have
a five-day plan.

19:18.872 --> 19:20.747
Yeah, Dro was a mess.

19:20.747 --> 19:23.081
Right?
But he just went
with the flow

19:23.081 --> 19:25.039
and he found
the perfect person.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.663
With Lionel...
( groans )

19:26.663 --> 19:28.372
I feel like he was
just checking off
his boxes.

19:28.372 --> 19:30.372
Get into a relationship,
check.

19:30.372 --> 19:33.039
- Hmm.
- What?

19:33.039 --> 19:34.997
He sounds
kind of like you.

19:37.206 --> 19:38.830
Damn.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.663
I was out there
like that?

19:42.497 --> 19:43.705
Issa?

19:43.705 --> 19:45.247
- Issa?
- Oh, God.

19:45.247 --> 19:47.830
I think I passed out real quick
from these paint fumes.

19:47.830 --> 19:49.997
Bitch, open a window.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.331

That's when things
get desperate.

20:17.455 --> 20:19.122
Why? 'Cause
everyone's drunk?

20:19.122 --> 20:21.997
Yep, and drunk people
make stupid decisions.

20:21.997 --> 20:24.914
