WEBVTT

00:22.606 --> 00:24.774
We have won
many victories in the arena,

00:24.942 --> 00:29.028
sent many an unworthy opponent
to the afterlife.

00:29.196 --> 00:33.783
Yet self-important men hold us
to the lesser matches of the morning,

00:33.951 --> 00:36.869
absent both eyes and prominence.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.456
Such time has found its end.

00:40.624 --> 00:44.794
Two days hence
our champion will take to the sands

00:44.962 --> 00:48.423
to face another
of Vettius' shit-eating dogs.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.925
Not in the streets,

00:51.093 --> 00:53.386
but in the fucking primus!

00:55.514 --> 00:59.809
Behold the champion whose
recent performance inspired

00:59.977 --> 01:03.312
good Varus to return
the House of Batiatus

01:03.480 --> 01:07.442
to proper position!
Behold Gannicus!

01:07.609 --> 01:11.904
Gannicus, Gannicus, Gannicus,

01:12.072 --> 01:15.199
- Gannicus, Gannicus...
- An inspired performance indeed.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.327
One not to be repeated.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.080
A true god of the arena!

01:21.248 --> 01:24.876
A man to be admired
and emulated.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.045
This is but glorious beginning.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.964
Soon you will litter the sands

01:30.132 --> 01:33.426
with the blood and bone
of all who present challenge

01:33.594 --> 01:36.596
instructed in the ways
of death and glory

01:36.764 --> 01:38.598
by a former champion!

01:38.766 --> 01:40.892
One of our very own!

01:41.059 --> 01:43.352
I give you Oenomaus!

01:46.064 --> 01:48.524
No longer to hold that name!

01:48.692 --> 01:50.902
No longer a gladiator!

01:51.069 --> 01:55.656
Now and forevermore
to be revered as your doctore!

01:55.824 --> 01:59.035
Yeah! Doctore!

02:01.205 --> 02:03.956
This has been wielded with pride

02:04.124 --> 02:07.335
by each before you since
the time of my grandfather,

02:07.503 --> 02:10.922
bestowed on only the most loyal
and honorable of men.

02:20.390 --> 02:23.976
Your will, my hands.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.443
Batiatus! Batiatus!

02:32.611 --> 02:35.279
Yeah!

02:35.447 --> 02:38.241
The primus.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.244
To gain such position,
Varus must truly

02:41.411 --> 02:44.455
have been impressed
with your prowess. As am l.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.919
- It was nothing.
- It is a great honor

02:50.087 --> 02:53.756
for yourself and this Ludus.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.052
Both of you bring honor
to this Ludus,

02:58.220 --> 02:59.846
each in his own way.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.403
Did you note how
he could scarce meet my eye?

03:16.488 --> 03:18.823
He must now heed my commands

03:18.991 --> 03:21.033
and does not embrace it.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.121
Will the other men share sentiment

03:25.289 --> 03:28.374
toward my honored position?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.753
It is his position
that stirs troubled thoughts.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.673
He sets mind to the primus

03:35.841 --> 03:38.551
as you must to training the men.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.722
I know this is not
what you wished for--

03:42.890 --> 03:46.475
And yet here I stand, elevated.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.644
As you deserve.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.646
For taking a life?

03:50.814 --> 03:53.900
For betraying hand that
forged the man before you?

03:54.067 --> 03:57.403
There was no betrayal
in what you did.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.908
Some acts cannot be avoided
when stripped of choice.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.829
Now...

04:06.997 --> 04:09.624
turn thoughts
from unfortunate past.

04:09.791 --> 04:14.462
We must look towards days
to come and embrace them.

04:45.869 --> 04:49.121
Barca, pair with Crixus.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.127
The rest of you...
continue training.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.183
At last the gods remove

05:09.351 --> 05:11.811
cock from fucking ass!

05:13.814 --> 05:17.316
The House of Batiatus-- no.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.946
The House of Quintus
Lentulus Batiatus...

05:22.114 --> 05:25.449
...rises to the fucking heavens!

05:27.744 --> 05:31.539
Soon my champions
will be carved in stone,

05:31.707 --> 05:33.916
towering above all who came before,

05:34.084 --> 05:36.961
and Gannicus will be the first of them

05:37.129 --> 05:38.879
after his victory in the fucking primus.

05:39.047 --> 05:42.049
The position was not gained absent aid.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.301
I offered naught but introduction

05:44.469 --> 05:47.555
and a few selected words
of suggestion.

05:47.723 --> 05:52.059
You could wile the
Goddess Laverna herself.

05:52.227 --> 05:56.105
Your place in this will not pass
without much fucking gratitude.

05:56.273 --> 06:00.276
The kind I favor most.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.278
Has a man ever been so blessed?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.010
Quintus.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.269
- Father.
- Gather yourself.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.272
I would have words.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.207
I leave this house in your care

08:20.375 --> 08:22.001
and this is
what greets me upon return?

08:22.169 --> 08:23.586
I was not expecting your arrival.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.424
Am I to announce myself
to the walls that I own?

08:28.592 --> 08:31.594
Of course not, yet if I had known
of your return from Sicilia--

08:31.761 --> 08:34.763
The knowledge would have
produced what result? Huh?

08:34.931 --> 08:37.933
Flowers and scented oils
laid to meet me,

08:38.101 --> 08:40.852
masking sight of a son
gone to shit?

08:41.020 --> 08:44.023
- I but celebrate.
- Upon what cause?

08:44.191 --> 08:47.234
Angering Tullius with refusal
of reasonable offer?

08:47.402 --> 08:51.071
- Your exclusion from the games?
- How do you come by that?

08:51.239 --> 08:55.326
I'm old, Quintus, not dead.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.579
There are still those in Capua
that hold my name in regard

08:58.747 --> 09:00.664
and would see me well informed,

09:00.832 --> 09:04.126
- good Solonius counted among them.
- Solonius?

09:04.294 --> 09:06.754
He sent word of his concerns
regarding your dealings with Tullius.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.465
The man is seized by unnecessary worry.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.468
Your face suggests otherwise.

09:13.845 --> 09:17.014
- A minor disagreement.
- Nothing with a man such as Tullius

09:17.182 --> 09:19.475
is ever minor.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.603
A fact obvious to the simplest of minds.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.606
Then it is a blessing a greater one
than mine has arrived.

09:25.774 --> 09:29.026
I bluster...

09:29.194 --> 09:32.154
when soft breeze would
be more welcome, hmm?

09:32.322 --> 09:35.115
You cannot ask
the wind to change its nature.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.246
My frustration is more with myself.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.498
You never wished for this--

09:42.666 --> 09:45.834
the Ludus, the gladiators,
the blood, the sand.

09:46.002 --> 09:50.172
Your eyes were always
towards the horizon,

09:50.340 --> 09:53.509
to glories and triumphs

09:53.677 --> 09:55.844
forever out of reach
of a common Lanista.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.806
Yet here I stand,
a Lanista like my father.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.892
Not like him at all.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.728
You have never been able
to look into the eyes of a man

10:04.896 --> 10:06.313
and gauge his true heart.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.484
Only days past, I looked
into the eyes of Quintilius Varus

10:10.652 --> 10:13.570
and gauged way to secure
the primus in his games.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.825
Varus has never employed
a Lanista not blessed by Tullius.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.577
Why now break tradition?

10:20.745 --> 10:24.290
Because I possess
what Tullius does not-- Gannicus!

10:24.457 --> 10:27.710
Gannicus?
The man is a jest,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.170
inciting more laughter than awe.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.590
And now I find he is desired
by half of Rome.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.759
Much has changed in your absence.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.220
And much has remained the same.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.597
I would review my men

10:40.765 --> 10:44.601
and see how they have fared,
denied proper guidance.

10:50.108 --> 10:53.652
Have feast prepared as instructed.
And send to market

10:53.820 --> 10:55.321
- for an amphora of mulsum.
- Yes, Domina.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.865
The highest quality,
not that shit from Flavus.

10:58.033 --> 11:01.243
Again with the honeyed wine.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.830
- Does the corpse drink nothing else?
-  Lower your fucking voice.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.624
The man has severed you from moorings.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.835
He is the paterfamilias.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.381
One word dropped from his tongue
could send us both to the streets.

11:14.549 --> 11:18.427
We must be beyond reproach
or fall to ruin.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.430
Very well. I will be a vision

11:21.598 --> 11:25.601
of demure obedience and propriety.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.772
On the outside at least.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.782
We are honored
by your return to Capua, Father.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.286
I am certain your heart swells.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.460
Oh, the clime of Sicilia has
most certainly restored health.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.840
Perhaps you do not recall me.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.675
Gaia, a dear friend of--

11:58.843 --> 12:02.346
The memory of you has
not yet faded. Quintus.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.600
We must prove
this fucking house in order

12:06.768 --> 12:08.560
and prompt decision
for his quick return to Sicilia.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.691
Withered old fuck.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.952
Eat, brothers.
You bear the mark now.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.578
Savor the taste of victory.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.709
Congrats, brother.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.927
Welcome, boys.

12:52.689 --> 12:56.733
Our piss once again

12:56.901 --> 12:59.987
- finds its way to their mouths.
- As if sucked from our cocks.

13:01.906 --> 13:05.325
- We bear the fucking mark!
- Received absent the test.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.912
A fucking goat may bear the mark.
It does not make him a brother.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.794
Hey!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.090
Hey!

13:28.808 --> 13:30.851
- Fuck did he say?
- Fucked if I know.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.729
He wants some more.

13:47.202 --> 13:51.121
You should not eat with lower men.
You are Doctore now.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.248
A title I did not seek.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.834
I would not have events
absent my control

13:56.002 --> 13:57.711
come between us.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.839
Nor would l.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.300
Ah, greetings.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.470
Auctus. Narto.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.976
Oenomaus.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.897
You assumed mantle of Doctore.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.899
After unfortunate death
of his predecessor,

14:19.067 --> 14:21.443
I chose Oenomaus as replacement,
knowing that he--

14:21.611 --> 14:23.779
Gather your food.
Let us retire to your cell.

14:23.947 --> 14:27.950
I would exchange stories
of the passing years, old friend.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.618
Dominus.

14:32.705 --> 14:36.208
Many regrets haunt a man

14:36.376 --> 14:39.002
as life draws nearer its end.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.466
Being too ill to witness your battle
with Theokoles in Pompeii

14:44.634 --> 14:46.260
counted deeply among them.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.762
A fight of legend I have been told.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.265
A defeat of equal proportion.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.017
Defeat? Huh!

14:54.185 --> 14:57.062
- You did not lose.
- Nor was I victor.

14:59.232 --> 15:03.151
You are the only man to ever face
the Shadow of Death and live.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.946
That alone is a great victory,

15:06.114 --> 15:08.657
one that has brought honor
to this house--

15:08.825 --> 15:11.577
well, as you have always done.

15:13.913 --> 15:18.208
And I would continue to do so...
in the arena.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.088
Are you not pleased
with elevation to Doctore?

15:24.382 --> 15:29.219
Give command and I would gladly release
title in favor of sword and shield.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.930
Oh.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.142
Words I am reluctant to speak.

15:36.519 --> 15:40.439
The doctore is second in importance
only to the Lanista himself.

15:41.858 --> 15:46.320
I chose Ulpius, oh, many years ago.

15:46.487 --> 15:50.240
This Ludus was his beating heart.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.951
The stilling of it is unfortunate news,

15:53.119 --> 15:55.912
tempered only
by you assuming his place--

15:56.998 --> 16:00.751
the sole decision my son has made
that I find agreeable.

16:04.714 --> 16:09.092
It is a position
I am not worthy to hold.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.595
There is none more so.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.432
From the moment I laid eyes

16:15.600 --> 16:22.856
in that awful place, I
knew that wild boy,

16:23.024 --> 16:26.318
so filled with rage and hate,

16:26.486 --> 16:29.905
would grow into the man
I see before me.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.662
We have traveled
a great distance together, Oenomaus.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.081
I would finish my journey comforted

16:39.248 --> 16:42.334
by thought of you
maintaining honor within these walls.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.004
A comfort I'm certain
your wife will share,

16:46.172 --> 16:49.132
knowing that you will not die
beyond them.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.386
Dominus.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.225
The way they fawn over him,

16:58.393 --> 17:00.519
falling to knee to lick his fucking ass.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.271
He takes over my house,
my gladiators, my fucking bed!

17:04.440 --> 17:06.273
Did he give voice toward

17:06.442 --> 17:08.777
- length of stay?
- He gives voice only towards

17:08.944 --> 17:12.030
considerable fault
of un-fucking-worthy son.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.990
Just leave.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.458
I secure the primus and he acts
as if I shit upon the name Batiatus.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.920
Oh, you raise it beyond
anything he can imagine.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.465
He will see this and bitter tongue
will turn to praise.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.969
He would sooner bite it off
than have it betray him so.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.810
I had forgotten the feeling

17:41.978 --> 17:45.480
of this sudden abyss

17:45.648 --> 17:48.525
as he sets disapproving eye upon me.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.987
Come.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.117
You'll not need
to endure his presence long.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.245
His health has fled
in these climes before.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.040
Should he fail to realize that
his house, his name

18:04.208 --> 18:05.876
is in proper hands,

18:06.043 --> 18:09.921
a forced return
to Sicilia will eventually arise.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.924
I would see him removed sooner.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.358
Your return lifts the heart, Dominus.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.489
Only for those who yet possess one.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.073
Gratitude.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.707
Attend.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.212
Pair up!

18:51.881 --> 18:54.007
Crixus, spar with Barca.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.968
Auctus, work the palus
until Gannicus joins us.

18:58.471 --> 19:02.891
Oenomaus, this one is too small.
I would have something

19:03.059 --> 19:05.936
- the size of a man.
- Barca!

19:07.188 --> 19:10.065
Do as your doctore commands.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.108
Yes, Dominus.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.697
Come. Let us see
what is between your legs.

19:30.044 --> 19:33.296
The Gaul winces from spear

19:33.464 --> 19:35.757
as he would from my cock.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.471
Is my long, hard weapon
too much for you, little man?

19:43.474 --> 19:45.600
I'm without lesson against it,

19:45.768 --> 19:48.228
but your instructions are well received.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.045
Apologies.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.716
- You rise earlier than expected.
- I rise at proper hour--

20:17.884 --> 20:21.720
an attribute neither you
nor your man Gannicus seem to share.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.222
Harsh words will find the man's ear.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.267
It could be shouted, yet ignored.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.145
Gannicus is no champion.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.189
I would promote Auctus
or half a dozen men in his place.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.359
- Mmm. Matter we disagree on.
- One of many.

20:36.527 --> 20:40.780
What man spars with Barca?

20:40.948 --> 20:44.451
Crixus, a fierce Gaul of worthy stock.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.411
I recall name from the ledger.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.039
A sapling of exceeding cost.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.583
The man will earn the mark
and see investment well returned.

20:53.836 --> 20:57.881
Doctore, bring Crixus up.
My father would have closer inspection.

20:58.049 --> 21:02.135
No, continue training.
We are to town for necessary business.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.387
I will have Barca prepared as an escort.

21:04.555 --> 21:08.183
Barca is a gladiator,
trained to wield weapon in the arena,

21:08.351 --> 21:10.393
not be yours in the street.
Now come.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.980
Your late rise already threatens
the appointed hour.

21:14.148 --> 21:17.984
And not one denari less.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.327
You would have me sit
with this fucking man?

21:27.495 --> 21:31.498
I would have you silent while
I attempt repair of damaged relation.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.543
Titus.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.006
Good to lay eyes, old friend.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.727
Your experience in delicate matters
of business has been sorely missed.

21:52.895 --> 21:57.023
- To be rectified presently.
- Come. Sit.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.823
You recall my associate Vettius?

22:04.991 --> 22:07.617
Vettius? Oh.

22:07.785 --> 22:10.120
You were but a child last I knew.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.915
How the years flee from us, eh?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.835
- How fares your father?
- Dead.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.130
Oh, apologies.
How terrible.

22:20.297 --> 22:24.050
The boy is ill-starred acquaintance

22:24.218 --> 22:26.052
with such misfortunes.

22:26.220 --> 22:29.180
Why only days past

22:29.348 --> 22:32.058
he was set upon
on our own streets

22:32.226 --> 22:34.728
on way to appointment
with Quintilius Varus.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.188
- Varus?
- The same man who,

22:37.356 --> 22:40.150
absent Vettius' presence,
managed to find way to your Ludus.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.319
Where this fucking cock-eater
stole the primus from me!

22:43.487 --> 22:46.614
Vettius, hold your tongue.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.326
How do you answer this?

22:50.494 --> 22:53.997
Pssh. He accuses, absent cause.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.502
My wife and her friend Gaia
came upon good Varus in town

22:59.670 --> 23:02.505
- baking under noonday sun.
- Gaia?

23:02.673 --> 23:05.508
She knew Varus from her days in Rome,
offered respite at my villa

23:05.676 --> 23:08.511
while he waited for the absent boy
to come to purpose.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.306
A fortunate coincidence
for all involved.

23:11.474 --> 23:15.310
Was it this same fortune that saw
me set upon by your fucking men?

23:15.478 --> 23:18.813
Did you see faces?
Did they bear my mark? You wet cunt.

23:18.981 --> 23:22.734
Enough!
Remove yourself to the street.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.569
Go!

23:24.737 --> 23:27.113
And leave reasonable men
to discourse.

23:29.617 --> 23:34.370
Your son has much to learn
from the ways of diplomacy.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.749
A subject all young men
struggle to master.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.210
Let us school them in its ways.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.744
You are better matched
against wooden men.

24:15.788 --> 24:19.415
Work the palus, Gaul.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.584
Resume!

24:31.887 --> 24:34.472
Are we to follow
Barca's commands now?

24:35.474 --> 24:39.853
He shares my thoughts.
The Gaul falters against spear.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.148
Perhaps advice from a champion
would aid his cause.

24:49.905 --> 24:53.283
Days past you fought me
with something approaching skill.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.994
Yet opposite Barca,
you act as his lover--

24:56.162 --> 24:58.121
face down with your cheeks spread.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.707
The spear is unknown to me.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.088
You are Gaul.
Did you never face the Arverni?

25:08.382 --> 25:11.426
My years before capture
never held the privilege.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.928
They wield spear
with deadly purpose,

25:14.096 --> 25:16.723
as does Barca
from the judging.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.975
He but instructs--

25:19.143 --> 25:21.519
each blow a lesson
never to be repeated.

25:21.687 --> 25:26.482
You should be quite the scholar
by the time he has beaten you to death.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.405
Crixus!

25:34.450 --> 25:36.451
You fought well
against my two swords.

25:36.619 --> 25:39.245
Rid a hoplomachus of his spear

25:39.413 --> 25:41.581
and he is left with only one weapon.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.799
Barca.

25:53.302 --> 25:57.180
lf you're done with your man's cock,
I would have proper contest.

25:57.348 --> 26:01.100
The gods bless Barca
with another tiny man to fuck.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.942
Your man Gannicus appears in fine form.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.818
As he will in the primus,

26:10.986 --> 26:14.030
elevating the house
with glorious performance.

26:14.198 --> 26:18.451
My heart yet races
at the thought of his last.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.914
We'll place such memories behind us.

26:25.918 --> 26:30.713
A difficult feat when
so enjoyed by all.

26:33.509 --> 26:36.344
- Some more than others.
- Come here.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.222
Apologies, Domina.
Guests have arrived.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.932
Guests?

26:41.100 --> 26:45.728
Varus.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.022
We were not expecting.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.317
Oh, the fault is mine
for failing to announce.

26:55.197 --> 26:59.284
Good Cossutius is on stay from Rome
to celebrate the Vinalia.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.328
After I extolled the virtues
of the House of Batiatus...

27:02.496 --> 27:05.540
- I demanded introduction immediately.
- You honor us.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.084
but my husband tends
to final preparations

27:08.252 --> 27:11.921
- for tomorrow's games in town.
- Oh, how disappointing.

27:12.089 --> 27:16.592
Yet we could remove ourselves
to the balcony for proper viewing

27:16.760 --> 27:19.887
of his gladiators until his return.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.307
I fear you mistake intent.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.935
I was not regaling Cossutius
with tales of your men

27:26.103 --> 27:33.276
but of your house's
more intimate delights.

27:35.237 --> 27:38.698
I fear that was
a special consideration.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.826
Was it?

27:43.162 --> 27:46.289
Perhaps Vettius will be
more accommodating then,

27:46.457 --> 27:49.584
concerning this and my primus.

27:52.588 --> 27:56.966
It would be unfortunate
to have come so far

27:57.134 --> 28:01.596
and find hands empty,
would it not?

28:01.764 --> 28:03.806
I would not have it so.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.601
Excellent.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.937
- Let us prepare Gannicus and...
- No.

28:10.939 --> 28:15.610
For what joy is there in exploring
ground already discovered?

28:15.778 --> 28:19.864
None at all.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.993
What do you offer?

28:24.161 --> 28:28.706
A gladiator of your
choosing paired with...

28:29.750 --> 28:33.503
a slave as yet untouched.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.382
Untouched?

28:37.549 --> 28:41.344
A delicacy no longer present
at the moment in my house.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.181
Then it is fortunate
you find yourself in ours.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.114
Solonius.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.990
- A word.
- And for you, sir?

29:03.158 --> 29:05.493
- Fresh just this morning.
- I would share its equal.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.329
I came to you as trusted friend

29:08.497 --> 29:11.249
carrying news of Tullius' renewed
offer towards Gannicus.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.709
You carried but shit
spewed from an errant hole.

29:13.877 --> 29:17.004
And what of other knowledge
I lighted upon treacherous ears?

29:17.172 --> 29:20.007
That of Varus' arrival
to be met by Vettius?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.093
- Vettius is a fool.
- Under the employ of Tullius.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.470
He will think I had hand
in the boy's assault.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.390
He suspects nothing. His thoughts have
turned towards my father inside.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.809
What seizes fucking mind,
dispatching message to him?

29:29.977 --> 29:32.645
- Your father is in Capua?
- He sits with Tullius as you bleat,

29:32.813 --> 29:35.481
- stroking fucking cock.
- Why do you remain in the streets?

29:35.649 --> 29:38.776
- Why do you think?
- I did not mean for his return.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.987
I sought only advice

29:41.155 --> 29:45.032
towards worry
for a man I hold as brother.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.828
Intentions well received.
Let us place transgressions aside...

29:48.996 --> 29:51.664
...in favor of more pressing concerns.

29:51.832 --> 29:56.419
Your patience and reason
recalls joyous times,

29:56.587 --> 29:59.964
when business was conducted
by those who shared respect for it.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.675
I fear we are a dying breed.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.720
I am certain you shall
outlive us all, Master Batiatus.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.973
Solonius, I hardly placed you.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.434
The years weigh heavy
on a man, do they not?

30:11.602 --> 30:15.855
Your presence is fortuitous,
striking need to seek you out.

30:16.023 --> 30:19.609
Share walk and let us
review recent events.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.827
Solonius...

30:31.121 --> 30:32.955
Am I allowed voice now?

30:34.500 --> 30:37.210
Could the gods halt the sound?

30:38.879 --> 30:40.796
Whatever Tullius
and the boy may think,

30:40.964 --> 30:43.758
I gained the primus
on merit of Gannicus' prowess.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.886
Even if true,
it is of no matter now.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.305
Gannicus will not appear
in the games.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.307
But Varus has made
personal request.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.310
A necessary sacrifice
towards leveling unequal ground.

30:54.478 --> 30:58.272
You will make apology to Varus, relaying
Gannicus found injury in training

30:58.440 --> 31:01.526
and that Vettius is amply capable
of seeing the primus attended.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.695
You give away the primus and now ask
that I tongue the fucking boy's ass?!

31:04.863 --> 31:09.033
I ask nothing!
This is how it will be.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.036
In return, a few of our men
will be paired

31:12.204 --> 31:14.038
against each other
after midday sun.

31:15.082 --> 31:18.292
- Our men fight themselves.
- The only plank salvaged

31:18.460 --> 31:20.753
- from such wreckage.
- Then we must choose the men with care.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.673
- They have been chosen for us.
- Tullius now selects

31:23.840 --> 31:26.425
- my fucking men as well?
- An unavoidable concession.

31:26.593 --> 31:29.178
Barca and Gnaeus,

31:29.346 --> 31:31.806
Auctus to face your Gaul, Crixus.

31:31.974 --> 31:34.475
Crixus is but a recruit,
not yet a fucking gladiator.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.686
Who you failed to mention
was purchased from Tullius.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.855
To gain-- to gain his favor.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.817
And what fruits did
your scheme bear? Huh?

31:42.985 --> 31:47.572
No, this is price due for attempting
to maneuver men above your station.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.116
Be thankful it was not more costly.

32:02.963 --> 32:05.673
Are you certain you would not prefer
the man bathed and scented?

32:05.841 --> 32:08.718
He stands perfect towards his cause.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.431
I would, however,

32:13.599 --> 32:15.933
gauge the freshness
of your offerings.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.023
Remove your robes.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.621
Did I not tell you?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.540
They are of a form.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.752
But a woman's worth

32:42.919 --> 32:45.421
is not always revealed to the eyes.

32:47.090 --> 32:52.637
A man must probe
deeper for true value.

33:01.730 --> 33:04.273
Remove yourself to the vestibule.

33:04.441 --> 33:07.860
Return if Dominus and his father
are seen upon the road.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.415
I shall have this one.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.876
She's considerably tighter.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.897
Move on top of him.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.828
Know why I chose this man?

33:58.995 --> 34:01.288
So crudely etched,

34:01.456 --> 34:05.334
the smell of shit hot upon his breath?

34:08.004 --> 34:10.965
Because this world is filled
with the grotesque

34:11.132 --> 34:13.342
and the divine.

34:14.969 --> 34:20.725
They exist together,
two sides of a coin.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.440
You cannot have one...

34:31.777 --> 34:34.280
absent threat of the other.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.993
And words...

34:40.203 --> 34:43.164
cannot convey the true nature of this.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.418
It must be experienced.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.088
It must be felt.

34:52.716 --> 34:56.342
And never forgotten.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.895
Oh, your presence has
been missed in Rome

35:06.062 --> 35:07.897
since your husband's passing.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.775
Your charms would brighten
darkest night.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.653
I long to return

35:14.821 --> 35:19.241
and crest dawn
upon a husband yet of this world.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.204
How does your dowry stand?

35:24.247 --> 35:27.833
I was under under impression
you were absent family of means.

35:28.001 --> 35:31.504
Gaia is a treasure
within herself.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.381
One to be coveted
by a man untethered

35:34.549 --> 35:36.550
to the burden of position
and appearance.

35:42.349 --> 35:46.602
Cossutius,
you were well satisfied?

35:46.770 --> 35:50.564
Praise laid upon your house
has not been exaggerated.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.858
It is a wonder.

35:53.026 --> 35:56.070
Such base diversion would be
impossible to conceal in Rome.

35:56.238 --> 35:58.280
Capua is a city of many pleasures.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.491
Often obscured by pressing business

36:00.659 --> 36:03.285
to which we sadly must attend.

36:04.371 --> 36:08.290
- You take leave so soon?
- A regrettable necessity.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.292
Gratitude for your hospitality.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.086
I look forward
to seeing you at the games

36:12.254 --> 36:16.090
and your man Gannicus
upon my primus.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.426
Oh, you honor us.

36:41.366 --> 36:44.910
- Crixus begins to show promise.
- Upon his back.

36:45.078 --> 36:47.538
The man always rises--
a trait to be admired.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.707
So you have eyes for the Gaul now?

36:49.875 --> 36:51.917
- And if I did?
- I would fucking kill you.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.216
Ah!

37:05.765 --> 37:07.766
Come here.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.881
You fucking cunts!

37:39.049 --> 37:40.966
You soil our food.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.218
Why shall we not make meal
of your fucking pets?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.799
Crixus!

38:25.929 --> 38:29.974
- You do not help your friend?
- This is a fight between brothers.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.393
I do not yet bear the mark.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.603
A fact Ashur is fond
of reminding me of.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.487
Have you lost fucking mind?!
Stand down!

39:07.262 --> 39:09.263
Calm yourselves!

39:14.644 --> 39:17.062
Is this what my house has fallen to?

39:17.230 --> 39:19.523
Brother setting upon brother

39:19.691 --> 39:22.860
so far removed
from the honor of the arena

39:23.028 --> 39:25.112
where such contest holds meaning?

39:27.907 --> 39:32.077
This points to reason
the gods have turned from us,

39:32.245 --> 39:35.289
stripping the primus from our hands.

39:35.457 --> 39:39.043
- I do not fight in the games?
- You do not.

39:42.464 --> 39:45.007
Yet our sacrifices
do not stand unrewarded.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.552
A few of you will take
to the sands after midday sun.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.681
And I expect those chosen
to bring more honor

39:52.849 --> 39:56.727
to the House of Batiatus
than you now bring to yourselves.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.785
Yeah! Fuck you!

40:12.952 --> 40:16.246
- Gnaeus fight Barca!
- Then I will split your ass in two.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.373
Fuck!

40:18.541 --> 40:20.334
You do not gain position?

40:20.502 --> 40:23.504
I do... against Crixus.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.798
Ah, your favorite.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.717
The man does not even bear
the fucking mark.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.220
Am I to fight?

40:35.350 --> 40:36.975
You are to die...

40:38.394 --> 40:40.979
at the end of my spear.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.155
So... you fight in the arena.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.741
I do not.

40:52.909 --> 40:55.661
The gods truly punish me.

40:55.829 --> 40:58.539
I long to be of the brotherhood,

40:58.706 --> 41:00.415
to become a gladiator.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.795
But to be awarded position--

41:06.881 --> 41:09.299
it is an honor I have not earned.

41:10.343 --> 41:14.805
There are many things given to us
in this life for the wrong reasons.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.809
What we do with such blessings--

41:20.019 --> 41:21.937
that is the true test of a man.

41:50.717 --> 41:51.967
Go well.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.385
Be victorious, brother.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.974
Give him hell, man.

42:00.852 --> 42:05.230
May Auctus fall, and Barca follow.

42:06.608 --> 42:10.402
Auctus. Gnaeus.

42:16.242 --> 42:18.535
Return victorious, brothers,

42:18.703 --> 42:21.163
for I am out of wine.

42:28.671 --> 42:33.675
After all we've done,
the sacrifices made,

42:33.843 --> 42:36.261
only to have
the primus torn from grasp.

42:36.429 --> 42:40.974
Pssh. "Torn" would imply resistance.
My father offers none.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.268
You could not move him
from this decision?

42:43.436 --> 42:45.771
Hercules would fail in the labor.

42:45.939 --> 42:49.316
Are we set to leave?
I would not arrive late.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.735
- Doctore gathers the men.
- Ah.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.946
Perhaps some mulsum
while you wait, Father,

42:55.031 --> 42:57.324
to celebrate your return
to the games.

42:57.492 --> 43:00.494
You seek to ply me
with honeyed wine?

43:01.913 --> 43:04.456
You find my weakness

43:04.624 --> 43:07.834
and I would have it exploited.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.879
- I shall join you.
- It disquiets your stomach too much,

43:11.047 --> 43:13.048
especially in hot weather such as this.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.342
- It never did agree with you.
- Guards!

43:15.510 --> 43:19.471
- A trait gained from your mother.
- A presence sorely missed.

43:19.639 --> 43:21.556
Every day.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.726
Hyah!

43:28.147 --> 43:30.524
Your Gaul appears ragged.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.111
Result of extensive training
and preparation

43:34.279 --> 43:37.489
- for the test he has yet to take.
- You set this in motion, Quintus,

43:37.657 --> 43:40.492
- by purchasing the man to gain favor.
- Only after I looked into his eyes

43:40.660 --> 43:42.619
and saw a spark
as you always spoke of.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.998
Then today presents rare opportunity.

43:46.165 --> 43:48.542
Auctus, a man forged
beneath my rule,

43:48.710 --> 43:51.086
to face Crixus,
forged beneath yours.

43:51.254 --> 43:54.339
The outcome to prove
if son has learned

43:54.507 --> 43:56.800
anything of worth from father.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.151
Your time has come.

44:58.363 --> 45:01.948
Gratitude...
for all you've taught me.

45:02.116 --> 45:05.619
Fight with honor.
And if the gods will it,

45:05.787 --> 45:07.496
die the same.

45:08.790 --> 45:10.874
Crixus.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.626
A word.

45:22.303 --> 45:24.012
You have shown great promise

45:24.180 --> 45:26.723
in practice and exhibition
against Gannicus.

45:26.891 --> 45:29.059
Yet this is the arena.

45:29.227 --> 45:32.771
This is where men become gods.

45:33.940 --> 45:36.358
Legions with far greater training
and skill than you

45:36.526 --> 45:39.653
have fallen upon this sacred ground,
many beneath Auctus' spear.

45:39.821 --> 45:42.364
But I do not think
that you will be one of them.

45:43.574 --> 45:45.742
You have the blood of a champion

45:45.910 --> 45:48.662
to rival any my father
has ever heralded.

45:51.374 --> 45:55.877
Do you wish to behold
such miracle come to pass?

45:56.045 --> 45:58.713
It is all I desire.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.551
Then seize fucking glory

46:02.718 --> 46:05.637
and see us both proven worthy.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.374
Have you set Crixus to purpose?

46:34.542 --> 46:38.086
Stoked the flame as best I can.
It is now up to the man to ignite...

46:39.130 --> 46:41.089
or be forever extinguished.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.886
It is a pity it is not Gannicus
nor the primus. It was well earned.

46:46.971 --> 46:49.598
Yet he is the one honored,

46:49.765 --> 46:52.476
while his only fucking son
is left to languish.

46:52.643 --> 46:55.145
Soon your father
will attest your worth.

46:55.313 --> 46:58.982
Or decay into the afterlife.
Either way, we will be free of him.

47:20.630 --> 47:22.464
Yeah!

47:43.486 --> 47:47.030
An epic showing
from the House of Batiatus,

47:47.198 --> 47:48.907
certain to please the gods.

47:49.075 --> 47:52.202
In gratitude,
we will be merciful

47:52.370 --> 47:55.247
and grant life!

48:05.967 --> 48:08.385
You are overly kind.

48:08.553 --> 48:12.681
Your house is being most accommodating
and should be rewarded.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.811
Well, gratitude. l--

48:20.273 --> 48:22.941
- Are you unwell?
- Perhaps the excitement

48:23.109 --> 48:25.151
is too much for him.

48:25.319 --> 48:28.238
- 'Tis but the heat and dust.
- Water.

48:28.406 --> 48:32.409
I would not have torrid throat
announce your final offering.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.578
Address the crowd?

48:36.914 --> 48:38.832
The honor is unfit a Lanista.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.751
We decide
what befits a Lanista, Batiatus.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.671
Make introduction.
Let us move on.

48:51.304 --> 48:53.972
I stand humbled

48:54.140 --> 48:56.766
before the great people of Capua,

48:56.934 --> 49:00.979
my home and my heart

49:01.147 --> 49:03.189
too long parted from chest.

49:04.734 --> 49:06.568
In gratitude,

49:07.653 --> 49:11.239
I present the final offering
from the House of Batiatus.

49:12.658 --> 49:17.037
Entering the arena,
a virgin upon its sands,

49:17.204 --> 49:22.125
I give you Crixus! Murmillo!

49:38.601 --> 49:42.896
His opponent, a
warrior unmatched

49:43.064 --> 49:45.273
in skill and honor.

49:45.441 --> 49:49.527
I give you Auctus! Hoplomachus!

50:01.999 --> 50:06.169
Capua!

50:16.430 --> 50:18.890
Just like last time!
Just like last time!

50:19.058 --> 50:20.433
- Come on!
- Begin!

50:25.523 --> 50:28.733
Kill the fucking Gaul!
Kill the fucking Gaul!

50:43.916 --> 50:45.250
Kill him!

50:59.515 --> 51:01.975
Auctus wields spear
to rival Mars himself.

51:02.143 --> 51:03.852
Well, he has been well trained.

51:04.019 --> 51:05.937
The same cannot be said of Crixus.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.982
Perhaps he should've remained
a hauler of stone.

51:30.796 --> 51:34.966
Cut him through! Yeah!

51:55.070 --> 51:57.572
Stupid fuck.

52:11.587 --> 52:14.881
- Kill the little cunt!
- Fuck!

52:18.385 --> 52:19.594
What?!

52:23.474 --> 52:25.767
Fuck!

52:43.077 --> 52:45.328
Fuck.

53:13.440 --> 53:17.026
Barca has taught you well.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.161
Yes!

53:45.014 --> 53:48.182
Crixus, Crixus!

53:59.403 --> 54:03.197
A fine showing, Batiatus,
with unexpected conclusion.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.616
Indeed it was.

54:10.456 --> 54:13.166
I swear to be burned, chained,

54:13.334 --> 54:15.627
beaten or die by the sword

54:15.794 --> 54:18.796
in pursuit of honor in the arena.

54:25.137 --> 54:27.221
Welcome to the brotherhood.

54:43.864 --> 54:46.699
Crixus proves himself.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.411
Perhaps even as match
for Gannicus one day,

54:51.747 --> 54:53.623
in and out of the arena.

55:08.222 --> 55:10.765
You fought well, brother.

55:33.747 --> 55:37.083
Your Gaul, still yet a recruit,

55:37.251 --> 55:40.378
defeated a gladiator I considered
among the best of my men.

55:43.090 --> 55:46.634
It would appear
I underestimated Crixus...

55:48.971 --> 55:51.139
as I did my son.

55:52.933 --> 55:55.852
- You honor me, Father.
- No, you honor yourself,

55:56.020 --> 56:00.189
- when cleared of plots and schemes.
- Thoughts far removed,

56:00.357 --> 56:02.358
- never to return.
- Nothing pleases more

56:02.526 --> 56:04.235
than to see reason take hold of senses

56:04.403 --> 56:07.155
and a house righting its path.

56:07.322 --> 56:09.699
I will see it continued in your absence.

56:09.867 --> 56:13.536
- Absence?
- Why, I assume you return to Sicilia.

56:13.704 --> 56:16.247
- Your health--
- No. Seeing Crixus's victory

56:16.415 --> 56:19.083
stirred passions
I have not felt in many years.

56:19.251 --> 56:22.045
The blood and the sand,
the roar of the crowd--

56:22.212 --> 56:26.299
oh, it lifts spirits more than
change of clime could hope to offer.

56:26.467 --> 56:30.720
No, I will stay at your side
and together we shall see

56:30.888 --> 56:34.474
the House of Batiatus rise
to former glories, huh?

56:34.641 --> 56:38.061
- You remain here?
- Uh-huh. Until breath flees

56:38.228 --> 56:40.396
wearied flesh,
calling me to the afterlife.
