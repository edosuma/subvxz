00:34.350 --> 00:37.649
<i>Welcome back, folks.</i>
<i>This is Gotham Talk Radio.</i>

00:37.821 --> 00:41.757
<i>Give us a call at 555-7630.</i>

00:41.925 --> 00:46.419
<i>Tonight, I promise, we're not going to</i>
<i>talk about President Luthor's impeachment.</i>

00:46.596 --> 00:48.496
<i>Instead, I wanna switch gears...</i>

00:48.665 --> 00:51.862
<i>...to Gotham's new fleet</i>
<i>of automated surveillance blimps...</i>

00:52.035 --> 00:54.162
<i>...which took flight earlier this week.</i>

00:54.337 --> 00:59.240
<i>Are these unmanned eyes in the sky</i>
<i>a black eye on people's privacy?</i>

01:01.244 --> 01:04.111
<i>That's what civil liberty groups</i>
<i>are saying. What about you?</i>

01:04.280 --> 01:08.239
<i>Before we get to your calls,</i>
<i>here's headline news. Vicki?</i>

01:08.752 --> 01:12.381
<i>A.J., blimps aren't the only sights</i>
<i>we've been seeing these last few nights.</i>

01:12.555 --> 01:16.252
<i>A rash of meteor showers has lit up</i>
<i>the skies from coast to coast this week...</i>

01:16.426 --> 01:21.363
<i>...following the destruction of a giant</i>
<i>kryptonite asteroid by our own dark knight.</i>

01:21.531 --> 01:24.466
<i>Today, NASA officials, who have been</i>
<i>monitoring the situation...</i>

01:24.634 --> 01:27.068
<i>...say we've seen the last</i>
<i>of these shooting stars...</i>

01:27.237 --> 01:31.401
<i>...since most of the kryptonite debris</i>
<i>has moved beyond Earth's orbit.</i>

01:31.875 --> 01:34.435
<i>Meanwhile, there's been no comment</i>
<i>from Batman...</i>

01:34.611 --> 01:37.842
<i>...who seems to have gone back</i>
<i>into seclusion.</i>

01:38.014 --> 01:39.845
<i>This morning in the nation's capital...</i>

01:40.016 --> 01:43.110
<i>...Superman completed his deposition</i>
<i>for the impeachment hearings.</i>

01:43.286 --> 01:45.379
<i>He hoped the removal</i>
<i>of President Luthor...</i>

01:45.555 --> 01:49.582
<i>...would usher in a new era</i>
<i>of peace and tranquillity.</i>

02:04.474 --> 02:07.500
<i>From what we gather, something</i>
<i>has come down near Gotham harbour.</i>

02:07.677 --> 02:09.235
<i>Let's take some more callers.</i>

02:09.645 --> 02:10.840
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

02:11.014 --> 02:13.414
<i>It lit up my bedroom</i>
<i>like the middle of the day.</i>

02:13.817 --> 02:15.148
<i>There was this big boom...</i>

02:15.318 --> 02:17.377
<i>...and then the whole apartment</i>
<i>just started shaking.</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:19.385
<i>I was so scared.</i>

02:19.823 --> 02:22.849
<i>Huge fireball.</i>
<i>My neighbour said it fell in the bay.</i>

02:23.026 --> 02:24.357
<i>Had to be a meteor, right?</i>

02:24.527 --> 02:27.155
<i>I mean, what else could it have been?</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:04.435
Hey, check it out.

07:09.579 --> 07:13.709
Well, hello, beautiful.
You getting a little fresh air?

07:16.219 --> 07:18.949
Whoa, whoa. Slow down, honey.
What is that, Swedish?

07:19.122 --> 07:21.590
Hey, Gus, I think she likes you.

07:21.757 --> 07:26.057
Come on, sweetheart. Let old Gus give you
a private lesson in foreign relations.

07:31.234 --> 07:34.294
Hey, lady. Gus may be a jerk,
but you shouldn't have...

07:38.207 --> 07:41.199
Lady, I didn't have nothing
to do with them. Here, take it.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.868
It's all I got. I swear.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.921
Hey, man, you okay?

08:00.263 --> 08:02.322
Tell me what happened.

08:17.146 --> 08:18.443
Lady, are you all right?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.718
Bring her down.

09:30.186 --> 09:31.881
Enough.

10:41.324 --> 10:45.260
I don't know who you are,
but you've had enough fun for one night.

11:34.477 --> 11:36.672
Her DNA is definitely not human.

11:39.181 --> 11:40.705
Enhance.

11:40.883 --> 11:44.319
Extremely high concentrations
of neural stem cells.

12:21.357 --> 12:23.985
Her name is Kara Zor-El, from Krypton.

12:24.693 --> 12:25.921
She's my cousin.

12:26.095 --> 12:29.428
Your cousin just torched $50,000
worth of custom hardware.

12:29.865 --> 12:33.392
- Send me the bill.
- On a reporter's salary, right.

12:42.578 --> 12:45.570
"This vessel contains
my daughter, Kara Zor-El...

12:45.748 --> 12:47.511
...from the now dead planet Krypton.

12:48.050 --> 12:50.177
Treat her as you would your own child.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.984
She will prove a treasure for your world."

12:53.155 --> 12:55.521
Treasure. You're sure of the translation?

12:56.125 --> 12:59.959
It says treasure. Not terror, not trouble.

13:00.129 --> 13:02.723
Always the cynic.
You can't help yourself, can you?

13:02.898 --> 13:04.525
You know those tests I was running?

13:04.700 --> 13:07.362
Her cellular structure
is a shade more dense than yours.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.800
She metabolizes sunlight
more efficiently.

13:09.972 --> 13:12.532
It could be her youth.
It could be something else.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.040
Bottom line,
she might be more powerful than you.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.907
It makes me wonder.
So does her sudden appearance.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.945
I find it just a little too...

13:29.425 --> 13:31.825
- Speak English.
- It's attacking.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.018
What's attacking?

13:33.195 --> 13:34.662
That.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.794
Krypto. No.

13:40.302 --> 13:41.496
Bad dog.

13:41.670 --> 13:44.503
Kara's a friend. Leave her alone.

13:44.673 --> 13:46.140
I'm sorry, l...

13:46.308 --> 13:50.244
I've tried to get him to like me,
but he just barks and growls, he hates me.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.073
Go up to your quarters.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.648
But I didn't do anything wrong.

13:54.817 --> 13:56.785
We'll talk later.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.621
Krypto's just feeling a little overprotective.
Aren't you, boy?

14:05.794 --> 14:09.093
I don't know. I've always considered him
a good judge of character.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.062
Look, she's been through a lot.

14:11.233 --> 14:14.134
Not to mention learning
an entire language in less than a week.

14:14.303 --> 14:17.500
- Why don't you cut her some slack?
- We don't know anything about her.

14:17.673 --> 14:21.336
She claims to have no memory of anything
prior to splashing down in Gotham Bay.

14:21.510 --> 14:23.501
I'm not saying there aren't loose ends.

14:23.679 --> 14:26.876
Having no control over her powers
is more than a loose end.

14:27.049 --> 14:28.107
She's dangerous.

14:28.284 --> 14:32.516
Which is why she's in quarantine
until she can gain control.

14:33.022 --> 14:36.116
She may be the only blood relative
I have left.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.160
I'm willing to give her the benefit
of the doubt, at least for the time being.

14:40.329 --> 14:42.456
You don't have a problem with that,
do you?

14:42.631 --> 14:44.292
No problem at all.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.093
But I can't speak for the dog.

15:21.403 --> 15:23.371
Spying on me now?

15:23.539 --> 15:24.767
You don't like me, do you?

15:25.207 --> 15:26.834
Huh. It's you that has the problem.

15:27.009 --> 15:30.604
Why can't you leave me alone? You'll
never understand what it's like to be me.

15:30.779 --> 15:32.770
Then explain it to me until I do.

15:38.487 --> 15:40.921
Does any of this help
fill in your memory lapses?

15:41.090 --> 15:44.548
Some. I know that's my Uncle Jor-El
and my Aunt Lara.

15:44.994 --> 15:48.191
Because Superman, Kal-El, told you.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.958
No. Because I remember.

15:51.133 --> 15:54.068
Uncle Jor-El was like my father.

15:54.236 --> 15:56.830
<i>They both believed</i>
<i>the planet was doomed...</i>

15:57.006 --> 15:59.065
<i>...which is why my father</i>
<i>also built a ship.</i>

16:02.211 --> 16:05.146
<i>He told me the navigation system</i>
<i>was locked onto Earth...</i>

16:05.314 --> 16:08.306
<i>...and that he and my mother</i>
<i>would soon follow.</i>

16:13.689 --> 16:15.281
<i>I was just about out when...</i>

16:16.725 --> 16:20.491
<i>I saw them die, right before my eyes.</i>

16:21.330 --> 16:25.391
<i>And then there was that light,</i>
<i>that awful, blistering light.</i>

16:34.476 --> 16:38.207
Then, all I remember is darkness.

16:38.380 --> 16:39.904
The rest you told me.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.277
How the asteroid carried me
across the galaxy...

16:42.451 --> 16:44.316
...until it broke and I landed here.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.483
Do you remember your mother's name?

16:46.655 --> 16:48.384
You know I don't.

16:48.557 --> 16:49.751
Why don't you trust me?

16:50.192 --> 16:54.925
Kal-El has enemies who would go
to great lengths to destroy him.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.156
You think I would hurt my own cousin?

16:57.332 --> 16:58.993
Perhaps not intentionally.

17:05.074 --> 17:08.669
I sensed your presence earlier
because I thought I heard your heartbeat.

17:09.078 --> 17:10.670
I was wrong.

17:10.846 --> 17:12.939
You have no heart.

17:41.110 --> 17:46.878
My Treasure, you are one
of the finest warriors on Apocalypse.

17:47.049 --> 17:52.043
But do you really think you have what
it takes to be captain of the honour guard...

17:52.221 --> 17:55.748
...to the almighty Darkseid?

17:55.924 --> 17:59.325
Bring them forth
so they can taste my blade.

18:01.196 --> 18:02.322
Furies.

19:20.609 --> 19:22.509
This one was no match for us.

19:22.678 --> 19:24.509
Let the dogs clean up the mess.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.675
You disappoint me, Granny Goodness.

19:28.851 --> 19:33.788
You led me to believe Treasure could
replace Big Barda as captain of my guard.

19:33.956 --> 19:36.891
She showed such promise.

19:37.059 --> 19:39.527
There has been
an interesting development on Earth.

19:39.895 --> 19:42.022
Bring me the girl
who fell out of the sky.

19:42.197 --> 19:43.687
The one they call Kara.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.966
And this time don't fail me.

19:47.536 --> 19:53.304
Or it will be you, dear Granny,
whom the Furies carve up next.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.601
I'm so glad to be out of quarantine,
I can't tell you.

20:54.036 --> 20:56.436
Don't get me wrong,
I like the Fortress of Solitude.

20:56.605 --> 20:59.438
But you have to admit,
it is a little boring.

21:02.711 --> 21:04.838
Metropolis is much more my style.

21:05.814 --> 21:08.112
This is the life I want, Kal. Uh...

21:08.283 --> 21:09.875
I mean, Clark.

21:10.485 --> 21:12.544
You've got plenty of time to decide.

21:12.721 --> 21:15.781
I wanna know everything there is to know
about being an Earth girl.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.619
Where do we start?

21:20.262 --> 21:23.322
I have a pretty good idea. Come on.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.721
Whoa!

22:23.992 --> 22:25.357
Ready?

22:25.527 --> 22:26.858
Ta-da!

22:31.700 --> 22:33.167
Well?

22:33.335 --> 22:34.859
Uh, no way.

22:35.237 --> 22:37.262
Perfect. I'll take it.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.403
Oops. Heh-heh-heh.

22:46.915 --> 22:48.746
Oh, my gosh. That was so much fun.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.578
I'm going to love being an Earth girl.

22:50.752 --> 22:53.277
You've certainly got
the shopping part down.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.049
Are you hungry? I'm starving.

23:07.002 --> 23:09.664
- They're not really made out of...?
- No.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.437
That's so good.

23:17.846 --> 23:19.143
Well, that's it.

23:19.314 --> 23:21.214
Shopping, junk food...

23:21.383 --> 23:23.749
I'd say you're a bona-fide Earth girl.

23:29.224 --> 23:31.192
It's so beautiful here.

23:31.359 --> 23:33.725
Not like that other city
where Grumpy Ass lives.

23:34.362 --> 23:37.195
Grumpy Ass isn't so bad
once you get to know him.

23:37.365 --> 23:38.662
What's his problem anyway?

23:38.834 --> 23:41.598
He just wants you
to take things a little slower.

23:41.770 --> 23:45.069
Adapting to a new culture,
any culture, can be difficult.

23:45.240 --> 23:49.301
Is that why you wear those eyeglasses,
as a way of adapting...

23:49.478 --> 23:51.776
...even though you can see better
than anyone?

23:51.947 --> 23:57.613
It's a way for those of us who are heroes
to have lives without the cape.

23:57.786 --> 24:00.550
It's important to keep
our identities a secret.

24:01.089 --> 24:03.887
That's why Mr. Friendly never takes off
his lead-lined cowl.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.590
You noticed the lead. I didn't know
your x-ray vision had kicked in.

24:07.762 --> 24:09.593
You didn't ask.

24:10.599 --> 24:11.725
Oh, my.

24:17.205 --> 24:18.900
This is how they see you.

24:19.074 --> 24:20.234
Bigger than life.

24:20.742 --> 24:22.107
You're their champion.

24:23.945 --> 24:25.606
These powers.

24:25.780 --> 24:28.578
- Do you ever regret having them?
- No.

24:29.117 --> 24:31.051
Not even a little?

24:32.354 --> 24:33.514
Can I tell you something?

24:33.688 --> 24:35.485
You can tell me anything.

24:36.458 --> 24:37.789
They terrify me.

24:37.959 --> 24:41.326
I mean, the responsibility.
I don't wanna be anybody's champion.

24:42.464 --> 24:45.297
- No offence.
- None taken.

24:47.135 --> 24:49.763
- What is it?
- Stay close.

24:55.610 --> 24:57.475
- Guess it was... Uh!
- Kal.

25:10.825 --> 25:12.816
Help me. Someone, anyone.

25:13.395 --> 25:14.453
Kara.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.670
We were told you would try
to stop us, but we're taking the girl.

25:23.838 --> 25:26.272
She's not going anywhere.

25:41.890 --> 25:43.585
It may not seem like it now...

25:43.758 --> 25:45.055
...but this is for your own good.

25:50.031 --> 25:51.726
You.

25:53.401 --> 25:56.165
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.969
She's right.

26:01.776 --> 26:03.744
I don't understand.

26:04.112 --> 26:06.740
Look around.
What if this had been the middle of the day?

26:06.915 --> 26:09.247
The park crowded with people, children.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.248
She needs more specialized training.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.082
I'm taking her with me.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.682
And what if I say no?

26:17.692 --> 26:21.184
There's another reason she can't stay.
I'll explain later.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.823
For now, I'm asking you to trust me.

26:24.766 --> 26:28.065
Kal, you're not gonna let her
take me away, are you?

26:28.236 --> 26:31.000
I'll work at controlling my powers.
I promise.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.833
Kal.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.503
Kal.

27:41.643 --> 27:43.270
Lyla, hurry.

27:43.445 --> 27:46.005
Kara is going up against Artemis.

27:46.181 --> 27:47.808
Be right there.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.474
Ready when you are, Artemis.

28:23.218 --> 28:24.776
Ready.

28:28.423 --> 28:29.947
Go.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.090
What's the point of this?

28:40.268 --> 28:42.065
Kara could level the entire island.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.769
Having power and knowing how to use it
aren't the same thing.

28:45.940 --> 28:48.170
You of all people should know that.

28:49.411 --> 28:51.436
She's getting on my nerves.

28:51.613 --> 28:52.875
I heard that too.

29:13.568 --> 29:16.230
Now, little one, prepare... Uh!

29:17.305 --> 29:19.205
Don't touch her.

29:19.374 --> 29:22.537
Kal, it's a training exercise.
She wasn't going to hurt me.

29:23.111 --> 29:24.203
Is there a problem?

29:24.379 --> 29:27.678
You asked me to keep an open mind?
Well, I've kept an open mind.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.545
But Kara belongs in Metropolis with me.

29:30.952 --> 29:32.943
We agreed this was in her best interest.

29:33.488 --> 29:35.319
Wait a minute, don't I have a say?

29:35.490 --> 29:36.957
- No.
- No.

29:38.493 --> 29:40.518
I'm sorry, of course you do.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.755
But you've been hidden away
on Paradise Island for two months now.

29:44.399 --> 29:46.993
You don't know
what the rest of the world has to offer.

29:47.168 --> 29:49.534
Who else is suited to decide
what's right for you?

29:49.904 --> 29:51.098
How about me?

29:51.272 --> 29:52.762
You let them bring me here...

29:52.941 --> 29:56.138
...and now because you have a problem
with it, you want me to return?

29:56.311 --> 29:58.871
I'm tired of being jerked around,
treated like a child.

29:59.481 --> 30:02.882
From now on,
I'll decide what's best for me.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.044
Come on, Lyla.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.623
Let's go before someone tries
sending me to bed without dinner.

30:16.264 --> 30:17.959
Don't ever do that again.

30:21.302 --> 30:23.736
You looked like you were ready
to snap Artemis' neck.

30:24.105 --> 30:26.266
Harbinger's visions show Kara in danger.

30:26.441 --> 30:29.069
How do you expect me to react
with a sword to her throat?

30:29.244 --> 30:30.802
I expect you to be rational.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.173
- Bruce.
- No.

30:32.347 --> 30:35.646
Ever since this girl came into our lives,
you've let your guard down.

30:35.817 --> 30:38.786
Even exposed your secret identity
despite common sense.

30:38.953 --> 30:42.081
Unlike you, Bruce,
I don't look for the bad in everyone.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.690
You may think I'm naive...

30:43.858 --> 30:46.986
...but my every instinct tells me
this girl is my cousin.

30:47.161 --> 30:50.688
She's done nothing to show me otherwise
and she'll be safe with me.

30:50.865 --> 30:53.356
Clark, the visions are getting worse.

30:57.739 --> 31:01.300
I know Kal is only trying
to protect me, but he's making me crazy.

31:01.476 --> 31:04.138
And everyone pretending to know
what's best for me. Agh!

31:04.812 --> 31:07.576
I thought I knew what I wanted,
but now...

31:07.749 --> 31:09.148
...I feel more lost than ever.

31:09.317 --> 31:13.310
Kara, when I first came here,
I was confused too.

31:13.922 --> 31:16.584
Able to see into the past, the future...

31:16.758 --> 31:20.387
...yet not having a clue
what to do with my own life.

31:20.595 --> 31:24.156
A harbinger for everyone but myself.

31:24.332 --> 31:26.493
Diana took me in without hesitation.

31:27.035 --> 31:29.799
If you need someone to turn to,
you can trust her.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.405
You've all made me feel so welcome.

31:32.574 --> 31:34.269
Especially you, Lyla.

31:34.442 --> 31:36.842
I feel like you're the only friend
I have right now.

31:44.886 --> 31:47.411
- Kara.
- What is it?

31:49.624 --> 31:52.422
Nothing. I'm just glad we're friends.

31:54.395 --> 31:55.987
Hey, how about a swim?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.189
I could use a little cooling off.

31:58.366 --> 32:01.358
Maybe we should get back.
Kal will be worried about you.

32:01.536 --> 32:03.595
Come on, one little swim.

32:03.771 --> 32:06.740
You're not afraid of the water, are you?

32:12.714 --> 32:15.615
Are you telling me
these visions are about to become a reality?

32:15.783 --> 32:18.843
- Lyla believes so.
- But she hasn't given us a lot to go on.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.046
Which is why it's just as well
we keep Kara in the dark.

32:22.223 --> 32:23.588
So we just keep waiting?

32:23.992 --> 32:27.587
This is the safest place for her, Clark.
I've had my army standing by.

32:27.762 --> 32:29.093
I can call them up anytime.

32:30.465 --> 32:31.932
Now might be good.

32:45.613 --> 32:46.807
Doomsday.

32:49.317 --> 32:51.182
Protect Kara, I'll handle this.

32:51.352 --> 32:53.115
Wait, the tube.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.613
It isn't closing.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.119
Darkseid. He's replicated the monster.

33:01.295 --> 33:05.061
Then we draw a line in the sand
and hold them here.

33:17.111 --> 33:18.840
Batman.

33:31.292 --> 33:34.659
Well?
Did you come here to sightsee or fight?

33:39.701 --> 33:41.191
Amazons, attack.

34:10.998 --> 34:12.590
There's no blood.

34:56.077 --> 34:57.510
Something's not right.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.412
Wait a minute.

35:43.324 --> 35:45.952
Diana, pull your army back.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.620
- What?
- Do it.

35:48.596 --> 35:50.894
Amazons, fall back.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.143
This ends now.

36:26.067 --> 36:27.295
I had no choice.

36:27.735 --> 36:31.136
They weren't truly alive.
No blood, no minds.

36:31.305 --> 36:33.136
You did what you had to do.

36:37.078 --> 36:38.978
Where's Batman?

36:46.354 --> 36:48.515
The Doomsday attack was a diversion.

36:48.689 --> 36:52.455
A second tube opened here.
There were four, maybe five.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.254
She didn't go down without a fight.

36:54.428 --> 36:56.157
Kara.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.369
Lyla.

37:42.109 --> 37:44.771
She died trying to protect Kara.

37:44.946 --> 37:48.143
I swear that her death will be avenged.

37:48.816 --> 37:50.283
I'm going to Apocalypse.

37:50.718 --> 37:52.845
That's exactly what Darkseid wants.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.715
Then I won't disappoint him.

37:54.889 --> 37:56.550
You mean we won't disappoint him.

38:02.263 --> 38:04.754
Let me go, you witch. Let me...

38:06.100 --> 38:07.124
Shut up.

38:07.301 --> 38:08.461
See?

38:08.636 --> 38:11.696
Granny has your room all ready.

38:12.073 --> 38:15.975
Don't worry, baby girl,
you won't be alone for long.

38:16.143 --> 38:18.611
Enjoy the accommodations.

38:30.958 --> 38:32.789
You may feel powerless now...

38:32.960 --> 38:35.724
...but soon you will watch the fear
in men's eyes.

38:35.896 --> 38:39.491
As captain of my Furies your fame
will spread throughout the universe.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.465
You will see the fiercest warriors
flee your presence.

38:42.636 --> 38:44.331
Armies brought to their knees.

38:44.505 --> 38:47.633
Entire nations crumble
at the mere mention of your name.

38:47.808 --> 38:50.299
You will know power
you would've never known on Earth.

38:50.478 --> 38:52.537
Never again will you be lost.

38:52.713 --> 38:55.079
From now on you will be at my side.

38:55.516 --> 38:59.577
Forever mine, forever Darkseid's.

39:23.110 --> 39:26.409
Over here, come on. Over here, I'm open.

39:53.908 --> 39:57.366
When I said drop in anytime,
this isn't quite what I pictured.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.037
Hello, Barda.

39:59.447 --> 40:03.816
Diana. You didn't leave, like,
an invisible plane in the driveway, right?

40:04.185 --> 40:05.709
We need to talk.

40:06.087 --> 40:08.385
Can I get dressed first?

40:13.561 --> 40:15.654
You were captain of Darkseid's honour guard.

40:16.297 --> 40:17.889
I defected.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.731
Was it easy? No.

40:22.370 --> 40:25.305
But for the first time, I'm free.

40:25.473 --> 40:27.134
And this...

40:34.248 --> 40:37.342
This nice, quiet, boring little life...

40:38.119 --> 40:39.416
...it's all mine.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.082
We need your help, Barda.

40:41.255 --> 40:43.587
Darkseid has kidnapped my cousin, Kara.

40:44.191 --> 40:46.022
Then she is lost to you.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.956
I'm sorry.

40:48.262 --> 40:49.661
Barda, you can't just...

40:49.830 --> 40:51.593
Listen to me, it's too late.

40:51.766 --> 40:53.393
Darkseid will control her mind.

40:53.834 --> 40:57.634
Mould her into a killing machine.
Exploit her weaknesses.

40:59.006 --> 41:00.803
Just like he did me.

41:01.442 --> 41:02.466
Barda.

41:02.643 --> 41:05.237
We know you were made
to do terrible things.

41:05.746 --> 41:07.338
No one blames you.

41:07.515 --> 41:09.745
Now he's got Kara, my cousin.

41:10.584 --> 41:13.576
We're going to Apocalypse.
We need your help to get there.

41:14.955 --> 41:18.254
You have no idea what you're up against.

41:24.498 --> 41:26.398
All we ask
is to borrow your Mother Box...

41:26.567 --> 41:28.797
...so we can generate a boom tube
to get there.

41:29.170 --> 41:31.229
It sounds as if you think
you're coming back.

41:31.405 --> 41:32.463
We'll get back.

41:32.973 --> 41:35.339
There are no exits
from that inferno, Superman.

41:35.509 --> 41:37.568
The entire planet is a death-trap.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.137
It was a mistake to come.

41:40.314 --> 41:42.441
If Barda refuses to help, how are we...?

41:42.616 --> 41:44.413
I'll help you get to Apocalypse.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.712
On one condition.

41:48.355 --> 41:49.652
I'm going with you.

41:49.824 --> 41:51.155
- Barda.
- No way.

41:51.325 --> 41:54.419
I know Darkseid's fortress
like the back of my hand.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.995
You need me, so get over it.

42:05.473 --> 42:08.340
I'm over it. What about you two?

42:51.886 --> 42:53.478
No place like home.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.054
Smells like death.

42:56.223 --> 42:58.020
You think Darkseid knows we're here?

42:58.626 --> 43:00.355
He knows.

45:06.420 --> 45:08.513
Well, I guess that warmed us up.

45:08.923 --> 45:12.120
We've gone over the layout of
Darkseid's fortress. We all know our jobs.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.055
Stay sharp.

45:24.371 --> 45:25.929
Good luck.

45:29.510 --> 45:31.068
I guess we'll take the low road.

45:31.245 --> 45:33.270
After you.

46:08.682 --> 46:12.846
This might not be the right time, but
you've always been an inspiration to me.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.515
- Barda.
- Seriously, Diana.

46:15.689 --> 46:19.682
When someone brings hope
to another person, it's a gift.

46:28.135 --> 46:30.194
And growing up in this hell-hole...

46:30.371 --> 46:34.501
Where you grew up, Barda,
is where you will die.

46:39.279 --> 46:42.271
Well, well, the gang's all here.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.751
You should never have come back, Barda.

46:48.922 --> 46:52.449
Although, personally,
I look forward to watching you die.

46:52.626 --> 46:54.719
I'd tell you to go to hell, Gillotina...

46:54.895 --> 46:57.728
...but given the situation,
that'd be redundant.

47:00.034 --> 47:02.195
They'll go for position,
try to separate us.

47:02.369 --> 47:03.393
Let them try.

47:04.071 --> 47:07.529
Furies, destroy them.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.927
- Damn.
- Bring the intruder's head to Darkseid.

47:45.612 --> 47:48.775
Glory to the one
who takes the life of the Kryptonian.

47:51.652 --> 47:53.313
Hail Darkseid.

49:01.155 --> 49:04.352
- They're very good.
- They should be, I trained them.

49:19.973 --> 49:21.133
Great.

49:27.147 --> 49:29.877
Okay, boys, chew on this.

50:05.352 --> 50:06.614
Bingo.

50:08.488 --> 50:10.649
Hell-spores.

50:11.458 --> 50:15.451
Enough power here to blow a hole
straight to the planet's core.

50:38.418 --> 50:39.851
Darkseid.

50:40.020 --> 50:41.214
Kill them.

51:28.302 --> 51:31.294
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

51:31.571 --> 51:33.300
Diana.

51:38.378 --> 51:40.107
Nice try.

51:44.551 --> 51:46.519
Let's see you smile now.

51:46.687 --> 51:49.349
Surrender, Amazon.

51:52.726 --> 51:57.095
- Barda.
- Surrender now, or the bitch dies.

51:57.264 --> 51:59.755
No, Diana, let them kill me.

51:59.933 --> 52:01.457
Never surrender.

52:03.637 --> 52:07.095
Imagine how pleased Darkseid will be.

52:07.274 --> 52:10.801
Why settle for some girl
who fell to Earth...

52:10.977 --> 52:15.311
...when I can deliver to him
the champion of the Amazons.

52:20.854 --> 52:21.878
Darkseid.

52:22.789 --> 52:25.053
Kara leaves with me.

52:26.026 --> 52:30.622
She's free to leave,
if that is what she desires.

52:36.903 --> 52:38.063
Kara?

52:41.241 --> 52:43.072
Hello, Kal.

52:44.144 --> 52:48.137
- Kara.
- I'm fine, Kal, really.

52:49.916 --> 52:52.749
I don't know what he's done to you,
but the nightmare's over.

52:52.919 --> 52:53.977
You're safe now.

52:54.154 --> 52:57.089
You're right, she is safe now.

52:58.058 --> 52:59.150
Let's go home.

53:01.862 --> 53:03.625
That's the problem, cousin.

53:03.797 --> 53:05.594
I'm not sure where home is.

53:05.766 --> 53:07.256
You're just confused.

53:08.602 --> 53:11.537
I'll be back. You and I have unfinished...

53:11.705 --> 53:14.196
You didn't listen to what Darkseid said.

53:14.374 --> 53:17.639
- Kara.
- You never listen to anyone.

53:22.382 --> 53:25.180
He said I was free to go, if I wanted to.

53:28.955 --> 53:31.355
And I don't want to.

53:37.063 --> 53:41.193
Good. Now kill him.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.695
I won't fight you.

53:45.405 --> 53:49.398
Good. Makes my job that much easier.

53:58.819 --> 54:00.150
What's wrong with the beast?

54:00.320 --> 54:03.153
Must be something he ate.

54:10.564 --> 54:11.861
Take off your armour.

54:13.366 --> 54:14.856
Now.

54:15.402 --> 54:17.302
Let me kill her, Granny.

54:18.672 --> 54:21.869
No, it's me you want. Let her go.

54:22.042 --> 54:26.001
I like to have my cake and eat it too.

54:26.179 --> 54:27.612
Make her bleed.

54:55.509 --> 54:57.409
You were saying, Granny?

54:58.912 --> 55:01.972
Go ahead. Kill me.

55:02.449 --> 55:06.317
- That's what you're programmed to do.
- Barda.

55:06.653 --> 55:08.678
What's the matter, Barda?

55:08.855 --> 55:10.982
You know you want to.

55:34.281 --> 55:37.842
All these years of pretending to be human
have made you soft.

55:38.385 --> 55:42.253
Kara, he's controlling you. Fight it.

55:43.123 --> 55:45.648
Do not hesitate. Kill him.

55:46.092 --> 55:48.458
As you wish, Lord Darkseid.

56:01.041 --> 56:05.671
With your death, cousin,
my life begins here on Apocalypse.

56:05.845 --> 56:06.937
Not if I can help it.

56:15.255 --> 56:17.519
Darkseid said
you wouldn't be up to the challenge.

56:17.924 --> 56:21.690
That your feelings, your beliefs,
would cloud your judgement.

56:22.596 --> 56:26.157
He's right, you know.
Earth does need a new hero.

56:26.533 --> 56:27.864
Not his version.

56:28.034 --> 56:31.663
You think killing me will set you free?
He's just using you.

56:31.838 --> 56:33.897
Liar. He cares about me.

56:34.074 --> 56:36.372
No, Kara, I care about you.

56:36.543 --> 56:39.603
But you won't listen.
His control over you is total.

56:39.779 --> 56:44.239
I see that now,
which is why I have to do this.

56:50.223 --> 56:51.417
It's over, Darkseid.

56:51.858 --> 56:54.918
Even you must realize the folly
of being a king without a kingdom.

56:55.095 --> 56:59.088
I doubt the battle between the Kryptonians
will bring about such destruction.

56:59.599 --> 57:01.362
I'm not talking about them.

57:01.534 --> 57:05.868
Your armoury, the hell-spores,
they've been activated.

57:06.039 --> 57:09.202
Impossible. The arming code is encrypted.

57:09.376 --> 57:12.243
I broke the code
and reprogrammed them.

57:12.412 --> 57:13.436
You're bluffing.

57:13.613 --> 57:16.514
Omega lambda <i>7</i>- X-L-9.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.446
That sound like a bluff to you?

57:21.054 --> 57:24.512
One hell-spore can turn an entire planet
into a fire pit.

57:24.691 --> 57:28.559
What will happen to Apocalypse
when 500 go off simultaneously?

57:29.162 --> 57:32.063
You dare? You dare?

57:36.870 --> 57:41.204
I could destroy you with a single blast
of my omega beams.

57:41.374 --> 57:42.534
You could.

57:42.709 --> 57:44.904
But that wouldn't stop the hell-spores,
would it?

57:58.825 --> 58:00.486
You will disarm them.

58:00.860 --> 58:02.020
Here's the deal.

58:02.195 --> 58:05.562
Release the girl and give your word
you'll leave her alone.

58:09.769 --> 58:12.135
Forswear Kara Zor-El.

58:19.713 --> 58:21.010
Say it.

58:26.019 --> 58:27.316
Well played.

58:29.522 --> 58:34.255
Had the Kryptonian or the Amazon
taken that gamble, they would have lost.

58:34.427 --> 58:36.554
They do not have the strength
of character...

58:36.730 --> 58:40.097
...to destroy an entire planet
to achieve success.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.891
But you, a human?

58:43.069 --> 58:45.765
You kill your own kind to win battles.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.770
An admirable quality.

58:47.941 --> 58:49.169
Take the girl.

58:49.342 --> 58:51.401
I will make no move against her.

59:00.787 --> 59:02.152
I'll hold you to that.

59:05.558 --> 59:07.389
We'll all hold you to it.

59:17.303 --> 59:20.033
Mercy, Barda? Disappointing.

59:28.648 --> 59:30.013
Disarm the hell-spores.

59:30.683 --> 59:32.514
Leave Apocalypse.

59:51.971 --> 59:53.233
Hey.

59:53.406 --> 59:54.668
Am I dreaming?

59:55.074 --> 59:56.166
What happened?

59:56.342 --> 59:58.810
I don't remember anything after...

01:00:00.313 --> 01:00:01.871
Lyla.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.012
You're safe now.

01:00:14.394 --> 01:00:16.362
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

01:00:17.597 --> 01:00:21.033
I remember dreaming,
a horrible nightmare.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.499
All I wanted to do was get home.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:26.195
I did terrible things.

01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:28.732
Darkseid lives for manipulation.

01:00:28.908 --> 01:00:32.537
He has hypnotists,
scientists and sadists...

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:35.545
...whose only functions
are to break your spirit.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.706
Darkseid is evil.

01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:41.382
But did he influence me?

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:44.045
Or just bring out a darkness
that is already there?

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:46.253
You're here with me.

01:00:46.426 --> 01:00:48.724
And you're okay. Nothing else matters.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:56.699
You said to me once
you didn't wanna be anybody's champion.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.498
When you're strong,
there's somewhere I want to take you.

01:00:59.672 --> 01:01:02.140
Where you can be safe.
Where you can fit in.

01:01:02.308 --> 01:01:05.072
Where you can just be yourself.

01:01:18.491 --> 01:01:20.152
You're sure it's a good idea?

01:01:20.326 --> 01:01:22.055
It feels right.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:27.358
- Can't let it rest, can you?
- Knock it off, you two.

01:01:34.474 --> 01:01:35.498
Lyla.

01:01:35.675 --> 01:01:38.337
I'm going to miss you more
than you can even imagine.

01:01:38.511 --> 01:01:42.106
You were my first friend
and you accepted me without question.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:45.979
Maybe because as Harbinger
you saw something in me that's worthwhile.

01:01:46.753 --> 01:01:49.654
Now, all I have to do is find that thing.

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:55.759
I'll try not to disappoint you.

01:02:02.201 --> 01:02:04.669
Diana, I can't thank you enough.

01:02:08.341 --> 01:02:10.172
You will always have a home here.

01:02:13.246 --> 01:02:14.907
Alura.

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:20.113
You once asked
if I could remember my mother's name.

01:02:20.286 --> 01:02:22.117
It was Alura.

01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:28.192
Kal, I'm ready now.

01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:35.862
- Thank you.
- You still owe me a computer.

01:02:36.035 --> 01:02:39.436
Might take a while. Reporter's salary.

01:02:42.942 --> 01:02:45.342
Always has to have the last word.

01:03:00.893 --> 01:03:03.191
Welcome to Smallville.

01:03:26.853 --> 01:03:28.878
This is where you grew up?

01:03:30.256 --> 01:03:31.280
It's not so bad.

01:03:31.457 --> 01:03:32.924
No, I didn't mean...

01:03:33.092 --> 01:03:36.960
It's just so different
compared to Krypton.

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:38.154
Even Metropolis.

01:03:49.142 --> 01:03:51.337
I think I'm going to like it here.

01:03:51.944 --> 01:03:53.275
It can be a little quiet.

01:03:53.446 --> 01:03:56.609
Kal, I've been chased,
shot at, kidnapped...

01:03:56.783 --> 01:04:01.277
...beaten up,
had my mind controlled and I broke a nail.

01:04:01.454 --> 01:04:03.012
I'm ready for a little quiet.

01:04:05.391 --> 01:04:09.384
If I know my mother, she'll have some
of her famous apple pie waiting.

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:12.154
You okay?

01:04:12.832 --> 01:04:14.766
Little nervous, I guess.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:16.868
It's just, you have this life.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.928
You can be Clark, or Kal-El,
or Superman.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.870
Even a son.

01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:24.606
Who am I going to be?

01:04:25.144 --> 01:04:27.840
I can't answer that, Kara, only you can.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.249
Whatever you decide,
I'll be there for you.

01:04:30.416 --> 01:04:31.815
I promise.

01:04:31.984 --> 01:04:34.612
Now, come on.
Let's go meet the folks.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:49.059
I gave my word
I would not come for the girl.

01:04:51.404 --> 01:04:56.364
Your death, however,
is long overdue, Superman.

01:04:59.512 --> 01:05:01.002
Kal. Uh!

01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:04.913
Kara, no!

01:05:13.759 --> 01:05:15.488
Stupid girl.

01:05:16.529 --> 01:05:18.929
You murdering...

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.691
Time to die, Man of Steel.

01:05:39.318 --> 01:05:40.342
Darkseid.

01:05:52.798 --> 01:05:54.390
There's more where that came from.

01:05:54.934 --> 01:05:57.232
Fearless. Untapped power.

01:05:57.837 --> 01:06:01.705
It would have been a glorious life for you,
captain of my honour guard.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:06.243
Instead, my omega beams
will reduce you to ashes.

01:06:06.412 --> 01:06:08.243
Take your best shot.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:27.649
Impressive.

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:32.416
Under my guidance, you could have become
the most powerful being in the universe.

01:08:32.925 --> 01:08:36.759
Your life here
will be nothing in comparison.

01:08:37.662 --> 01:08:39.596
But it'll be my life.

01:09:08.928 --> 01:09:11.988
We will meet again, Kryptonian.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:25.407
You didn't think
you could just walk away, did you?

01:11:05.644 --> 01:11:11.640
Don't ever come here again,
or you won't be going back.

01:11:39.745 --> 01:11:42.942
That should give him something
to think about back on Apocalypse.

01:11:43.115 --> 01:11:45.549
Apocalypse? I'm not so sure.

01:11:46.151 --> 01:11:47.175
While you were busy...

01:11:47.353 --> 01:11:50.754
...I took the liberty of reconfiguring
the boom tube's coordinates.

01:11:50.923 --> 01:11:52.481
Something Darkseid taught me...

01:11:52.658 --> 01:11:55.559
...that I'm guessing
he's probably regretting about now.

01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:04.865
I don't think he'll be a problem again.

01:12:06.272 --> 01:12:09.139
Not until someone
thaws him out anyway.

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:19.610
Kal, there was a moment there
when I thought you were dead.

01:12:19.785 --> 01:12:21.685
And I realized, ever since I arrived...

01:12:21.854 --> 01:12:25.813
...I've been running away from who I am
and what I'm meant to be.

01:12:27.359 --> 01:12:29.259
I've made a decision, Kal.

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.089
I know what I want to do.

01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:36.532
Uh-oh.

01:12:53.419 --> 01:12:56.718
Mom, Dad, this is Kara.

01:12:56.889 --> 01:12:58.948
My cousin? Your niece?

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:01.854
Mr. Kent, Mrs. Kent.

01:13:02.027 --> 01:13:03.892
It's so nice to finally meet you.

01:13:04.063 --> 01:13:06.361
I've heard so much about you both.

01:13:10.703 --> 01:13:12.534
Don't worry,
I can build you a new one.

01:13:12.705 --> 01:13:14.605
I can help. I'm great with a hammer.

01:13:14.773 --> 01:13:16.798
I can pound.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.068
I'm a good pounder.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:30.417
I know how busy you all are...

01:13:30.589 --> 01:13:33.820
...but it's only appropriate
that you should be the first to hear.

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:38.191
You, who would put your lives
on the line for a perfect stranger.

01:13:38.797 --> 01:13:42.426
We're all alike, for each of us,
in our own way...

01:13:42.601 --> 01:13:44.694
...had to struggle to become who we are.

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:49.029
But what better role
for anyone to aspire to, than hero?

01:13:49.575 --> 01:13:53.875
So allow me to reintroduce my cousin,
Kara Zor-El.

01:13:54.046 --> 01:13:58.676
Or as the world
will come to know her, Supergirl.

01:14:03.789 --> 01:14:07.725
To be honest, I'm not sure
I've earned the right to wear this uniform.

01:14:08.327 --> 01:14:09.885
But I will.

01:14:50.769 --> 01:14:51.793
Hey.
