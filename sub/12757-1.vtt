02:15.426 --> 02:18.720
man: Meet my cousin,
Alex Sperling.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.890
You're probably wondering,
"Hey, who's this Alex kid

02:21.975 --> 02:25.060
and why is he fighting
a guy dressed as a unicorn?"

02:25.145 --> 02:26.520
And more importantly,

02:26.604 --> 02:29.064
who are all those girls
with really big tits?

02:29.149 --> 02:33.152
i can explain all those things,
but first, let's rewind.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.904
( imitating tape rewinding )

02:35.989 --> 02:36.738
Okey-dokey.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.949
Here we are, like two months
earlier,

02:39.033 --> 02:41.493
graduation day in
Southfield, Michigan.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.619
You've seen it all before.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.705
Caps, gowns,
kvetching parents,

02:44.789 --> 02:46.915
typical graduation speeches.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.085
Graduates, we are about to
step into the real world

02:50.170 --> 02:52.212
and, frankly...

02:52.297 --> 02:56.008
it blows.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.467
i wanna live now.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.512
i wanna travel
and get high at concerts

03:00.597 --> 03:02.389
and bungee-jump naked

03:02.473 --> 03:05.350
and experiment sexually with
multiple partners.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.311
( cheers and applause )

03:07.395 --> 03:11.398
So i say to you,
senior class, carpe diem.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.192
Suck the marrow
out of life.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.319
Suck it,
suck it, suck it!

03:15.403 --> 03:19.907
( cheers and applause )

03:19.991 --> 03:20.324
Thank you.

03:24.287 --> 03:28.498
Thank you, Class President
Victoria Mills.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.211
That was very, uh, graphic.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.504
Our final speaker

03:34.589 --> 03:37.507
is one of
Southfield's shining lights.

03:37.592 --> 03:41.136
National Merit Scholar
Alex Sperling.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.388
( applauding )

03:43.473 --> 03:45.265
Bravo!

03:45.350 --> 03:47.434
man: Oh, and there's his folks,

03:47.518 --> 03:48.227
my Uncle Martin
and Aunt Nancy.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.896
Little stiff, but good people.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.107
They're anthropologists
or orthodontist-ists or--

03:54.192 --> 03:56.109
Something with an "-ist."

03:58.696 --> 04:00.822
Wow, that went fast.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.866
We're done.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.576
But, you know,
this is only the beginning...

04:04.661 --> 04:05.577
man: Blah, blah.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.329
i know you don't
want to hear the speech.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.706
i was there and, frankly,
it kinda sucked,

04:09.791 --> 04:10.290
so let's get
to the good part.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.376
That's where i show up.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.502
Oh, have a good summer.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.839
- My boy!
- Hey, Mom.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.299
Congratulations, baby.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.425
Thank you, thank you.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.344
- Dad?
- You're a man now.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.513
Congratulations.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.973
Harvard is lucky
to be getting you.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.516
Thank you, sir.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.184
Oh, my God.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.062
Roger?

04:32.146 --> 04:34.231
When did this
become a ViP event?

04:34.315 --> 04:35.607
You didn't tell us
you were coming.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.026
There i am, Roger Sperling.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.027
i have a speaking engagement

04:39.112 --> 04:41.280
at an engineering conference
here in Detroit.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.907
Owner of my own
hydraulic engineering firm,

04:43.992 --> 04:47.160
philanthropist, philosopher and
all-around love machine.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.787
Ow!

04:48.871 --> 04:50.580
So i thought
i'd surprise you guys.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.041
i can't believe
you're here!

04:53.126 --> 04:54.710
- You were awesome.
- Thank you.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.253
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.671
So, Aunt Nancy, Uncle Martin,

04:57.755 --> 04:59.339
you mind if i steal boy wonder
for a second?

04:59.424 --> 05:00.340
- No, not at all.
- Have a little heart-to-heart.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.801
Great.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.052
Hey!

05:04.137 --> 05:05.304
So you going to the afterparty
down in Addison's pond?

05:05.388 --> 05:07.222
Between you and i,

05:07.307 --> 05:08.682
that's where i lost
Teri Raskin's virginity,

05:08.766 --> 05:10.726
so if you happen to see it
there, just let me know.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.227
No, man, i--
look, i can't go to the pond.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.105
i fly out to D.C. at like
6:00 a.m.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.649
Do you know how many
strings my dad had to pull

05:17.734 --> 05:19.359
to get me this internship
with Senator Brewster?

05:19.444 --> 05:22.863
And, Roger, i have to
show leadership this summer

05:22.947 --> 05:24.281
because if i don't get
this scholarship,

05:24.365 --> 05:25.449
i can't go to Harvard

05:25.533 --> 05:26.825
and if i don't go to Harvard,
i mean...

05:26.909 --> 05:29.119
Hey, hey,
Alex, come on.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.329
You're gonna get the
scholarship, relax.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.873
Breathe.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.250
When you're in D.C. or at
Harvard, if you need anything,

05:35.335 --> 05:36.376
advice, letter of
recommendation,

05:36.461 --> 05:40.672
a stock tip,
you call your cousin Roger

05:40.757 --> 05:42.132
and i'll hook you up,
all right?

05:42.216 --> 05:43.258
Yes, thank you.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.389
( tires screeching )

06:04.781 --> 06:06.323
- "The Post" is on the phone!
- Excuse me?

06:06.407 --> 06:07.616
- Hi.
- Do me a favor.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.284
- Unplug that phone.
- Oh, sure.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.703
Wow, it's a busy place.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.288
Um, my name's
Alex Sperling.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.706
it's a pleasure to be
joining the team.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.999
Welcome to Washington.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.709
- Start shredding.
- Oh, well, i don't--

06:17.794 --> 06:20.170
- Shred!
- Sure, okay.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.714
No problem, i just wanted to
thank you and the senator,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.341
you know, for the opportunity
to get my scholarship...

06:24.425 --> 06:26.760
... so i can go to Harvard,

06:26.844 --> 06:29.179
and it's truly rare
in politics nowadays

06:29.263 --> 06:31.223
to find someone with
such character

06:31.307 --> 06:34.226
- and integrity and...
- Come on, flush, you bastard!

06:34.310 --> 06:35.435
Come on!

06:35.520 --> 06:36.478
What are you going?
Whoa!

06:36.562 --> 06:37.938
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:38.022 --> 06:39.564
We're not having such
a great day, are we?

06:39.649 --> 06:40.649
i hate to disappoint you,

06:40.733 --> 06:42.984
but your man of character
and integrity

06:43.069 --> 06:44.820
has one tiny little weakness.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.655
Oh, well, you know,
i heard Abraham Lincoln

06:46.739 --> 06:48.740
couldn't turn down
a piece of cake.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.701
Could Honest Abe pass up
ten-year-old Filipino boys?

06:51.786 --> 06:52.536
- Excuse me?
- FBi!

06:52.620 --> 06:53.453
Get your hands up,
let's go, son!

06:53.538 --> 06:55.372
Leave it alone!

06:55.456 --> 06:56.873
- Let me see your hands!
- Freeze!

06:56.958 --> 06:58.375
Stop the shredding now!

06:58.459 --> 07:00.085
if you need anything,

07:00.169 --> 07:01.420
you call your cousin Roger
and i'll hook you up.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.588
Now, i never
would have said that

07:03.673 --> 07:06.299
if i thought he was gonna
take me seriously.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.579
You know how you said to call
you if i needed anything?

07:35.663 --> 07:36.371
Yeah, anything.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.414

i need you to pick me up.

You're here?
Now?

07:44.714 --> 07:45.755
Yeah.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.132
Look, i'll explain
everything when you get here.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.259
Just meet me at baggage claim,
okay, Roger?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.302
No, no--

07:50.386 --> 07:53.472
Hey, hey, Alex,
Al-- Alex, Alex?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.891
Roger, stop lounging.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.225
Let's get
the pool cleaned.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.977
Lounge-- i was just waiting
for the chlorine to stabilize,

07:59.061 --> 08:00.353
Mr. Davi, sir.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.730
Yeah, well, stabilize by
getting the pool cleaned.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.398
- i got people coming over.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Davi.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.067
And stop with
the Eddie Haskell bullshit.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.736
Just clean the pool.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.653
Okay, yes, i lied.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.698
To you, to Alex,
to everyone in the world,

08:11.782 --> 08:14.409
i don't own my own
hydro-engineering

08:14.494 --> 08:16.286
whatever-the-hell-i-said.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.164
i clean pools for a living
and i'm a liar,

08:19.248 --> 08:21.166
'cause, frankly,
"captain of industry"

08:21.250 --> 08:23.043
works much better than
"pool boy"

08:23.127 --> 08:24.669
when you're
trying to get a date.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.009
Yo, what's up, homey?

08:31.093 --> 08:32.427
Give me your money, dog!

08:32.512 --> 08:34.095
Hey.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.388
- What's up, bro?
- Thanks for coming.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.516
i really appreciate this on
such short notice, thank you.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.309
Hey, what happened in D.C.?

08:39.393 --> 08:42.187
- Senator Brewster?
- Ooh, he's dirty.

08:42.271 --> 08:42.938
He didn't touch you,
did he?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.148
Oh no, turns out
i'm not his type.

08:45.233 --> 08:45.774
Too bad-- i am.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.651
Whistle, ooh, whistle!

08:47.735 --> 08:49.444
- Ow!
- Big bag for the weekend.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.154
You wanna hit
the beaches or what?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.322
i need a job.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.410
My parents are in Africa
on a research grant.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.453
if i don't have a job, then
i can't get this scholarship,

08:58.538 --> 09:01.414
then how am i gonna pay
for college?

09:01.499 --> 09:02.666
Let alone Harvard.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.753
i need your help, Roger.

09:06.837 --> 09:07.504
Seriously?

09:07.588 --> 09:10.090
Yeah.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.347
Yeah, all right, fine.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.683
- All right.
- i mean, i can't pay you.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.477
No, that's okay,
it's an internship.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.354
Do you know anything about
aquatic engineering?

09:24.438 --> 09:25.772
it's not as glamorous
as you think.

09:25.856 --> 09:26.940
No, that's okay.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.441
i don't need glamour,
i just need a job.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.193
i mean, it's really not
glamorous in any way,

09:30.278 --> 09:31.403
- shape or form.
- That's totally fine.

09:31.487 --> 09:31.903
Are you good at math?

09:31.988 --> 09:34.030
There's a lot of math.

09:34.115 --> 09:34.614
Yeah, no, i'm good.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.791
All right, here we are.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.334
Sorry again about the car.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.670
i can't wait to
get my Mercedes back.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.339
These auto-shop loaners
are a real disaster.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.924
it's okay, i love NASCAR.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.135
Yeah.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.344
That's good.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.558
You live here?

10:01.642 --> 10:03.727
Yeah, right.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.479
it belongs to one of my
junior engineers.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.064
Oh, thank God.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.651
They're off-site right now
building a dam in Dubai.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.739
He's just letting me crash
here for a couple months

10:15.823 --> 10:17.991
until my place in
the Palisades is done.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.075
it's six months overdue.

10:19.160 --> 10:19.993
Do you believe that?

10:20.077 --> 10:21.870
Dude, contractors.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.872
i mean,
they're worse than...

10:23.956 --> 10:24.623
Yo, Rog!

10:24.707 --> 10:26.625
... drug dealers.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.251
i got your weed, man.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.837
i couldn't remember, did you
want an eighth or a quarter?

10:30.921 --> 10:34.674
Get away from the building,
you-- you purveyor of sin!

10:34.759 --> 10:36.259
Yeah, i wanted an eighth.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.385
An eighth of Hindu Kush,
you got it?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.261
Okay.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.554
Get-- get out of here!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.848
Jerk!

10:41.932 --> 10:42.724
Huh.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.726
Yes.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.020
Sorry about that.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.271
What was that all about?

10:48.356 --> 10:49.314
That guy, Eddie,

10:49.398 --> 10:51.524
he's just a bad element
in the neighborhood.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.863
So this is it,
my temporary digs.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.699
And this is where you'll
be spending

10:59.784 --> 11:02.869
the next six weeks.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.747
it's-- it's actually a lot more
comfortable than it looks.

11:06.874 --> 11:09.626
Okay, now,
Alex wasn't a total idiot.

11:09.710 --> 11:13.088
There's one surefire way to keep
any red-blooded male

11:13.172 --> 11:14.798
from thinking properly.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.091
( knocking )

11:16.175 --> 11:18.051
Hey, Rog, Whole Foods
doesn't actually sell

11:18.135 --> 11:19.344
Wonder Bread, Miracle Whip,

11:19.428 --> 11:21.680
so i got you cracked wheat
and Vegenaise.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.181
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.558
Oh, this is my cousin Alex.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.601
Alex,
this is my neighbor--

11:26.686 --> 11:29.896
My employee's neighbor, Laura.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.608
Um, i gotta go put
my stuff away,

11:33.693 --> 11:37.195
so... welcome to LA, Alex.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.638
it doesn't even have
a tennis court.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.725
All right, technological
supplies.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.228
This right here
is a sediment displacer.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.981
That is a polymer-based
discharge reservoir.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.065
Right.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.068
- Submersible sonic piping.
- Uh-huh.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.737
Very important,
liquid attitude adjuster.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.738
Okay.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.532
And... let's do some
engineering.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.742
All right.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.244
Now, what you're gonna see here
looks like a common pool,

12:26.328 --> 12:29.539
but what i'm doing
is very cutting-edge.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.041
Yeah, it's one of my--
my test houses.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.961
i like to be out
in the-- in the field.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.005
Good for morale.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.924
Um... i'm working on
a new salinity test for

12:40.009 --> 12:40.842
aquatic entertainment
environments.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.927
Wow.

12:43.012 --> 12:47.223
i'm gonna put a 60-inch
plasma in the deep end.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.808
- Really?
- Sure.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.699
Jesus Christ.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.168
Hey, whoa!

13:15.252 --> 13:17.170
Oh, sh-- Hector, Hector!

13:17.254 --> 13:19.088
- Roger!
- Hector, that's my cousin!

13:19.173 --> 13:20.381
Who are you, cabrón?

13:20.466 --> 13:21.925
And why were you staring
at la Señora Ashmore?

13:22.009 --> 13:22.967
i wasn't!

13:23.052 --> 13:24.302
- Hey!
- Roger!

13:24.386 --> 13:26.387
That's my cousin, Alex!

13:26.472 --> 13:28.223
He's helping me out today.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.350
- ¿Oh, que paso, Rogelio?
- Yeah.

13:30.434 --> 13:30.934
Hey.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.478
i'm sorry, mister, okay?

13:33.562 --> 13:34.646
Nice to meet you.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.438
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.524
( grunting )

13:37.608 --> 13:40.401
Oh, Mr. Stenson told me to tell
you that the pool needs

13:40.486 --> 13:41.778
a filter because
it's getting clogged up.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.739
La muerta Bethany is getting
stickers all over the pool

13:44.824 --> 13:47.534
Hablamos mañana.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.206
- Okay.
- Thank you.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.791
( grunting )

13:54.875 --> 13:56.417
Ciao.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.924
You're a pool boy.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.134
i'm more of a pool man.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.679
You're a pool boy.

14:07.763 --> 14:08.972
Great.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.431
He's a pool boy.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.058
- Um...
- That's fantastic.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.269
So you don't have a house
in the Palisades?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.103
No house.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.564
And you don't drive
a Mercedes-Benz.

14:17.648 --> 14:17.981
i have driven one.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.941
And that.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.193
That's no poly-waddle
discharge whatever.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.695
it's a plastic bucket.

14:23.779 --> 14:24.988
That is,
in fact, a bucket.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.240
So then who
the hell are you, man?

14:27.324 --> 14:27.991
- i'm your cousin, Roger.
- No.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.951
No, no, no, you're not.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.078
My cousin Roger
went to Harvard.

14:32.162 --> 14:35.373
He graduated Phi Beta Kappa
and Summa Cum Laude.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.958
Roger owns his own
aquatic engineering firm.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.918
Roger...

14:39.003 --> 14:41.880
that guy dropped out.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.799
i dropped out
after my freshman year.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.009
Just...

14:51.265 --> 14:52.015
Well, that's perfect.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.728
- Oh!
- Shit.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.063
All right, come on,
where you going?

14:59.148 --> 15:00.690
- Back to Michigan.
- You can't go back to Michigan.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.942
You don't have a job and your
mom and dad are in Africa.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.611
Well, it beats sleeping on
an eviscerated sofa

15:04.695 --> 15:06.112
- with some fraud.
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:06.196 --> 15:07.488
Let me ask you a question.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.991
Who's the guy that gave you his
entire collection of "Swank"

15:10.075 --> 15:13.912
and "Penthouse" when you
turned 1 3 years old?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.121
i came out here

15:15.205 --> 15:17.457
because i thought
that you had a real job.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.042
My entire life depends on
this scholarship.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.001
What am i supposed to
tell them at the interview?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.837
That i learned how to
balance pH levels?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.380
First of all,
that's harder than it looks.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.007
And second of all, you're not
gonna lose your scholarship.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.967
All right,
we're smart guys.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.345
We'll think of something.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.846
it's like my buddy
Kierkegaard said:

15:31.931 --> 15:36.100
"Anxiety is
the dizziness of freedom."

15:36.185 --> 15:38.353
And you're just a little
dizzy, that's all.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.979
All right?

15:40.064 --> 15:40.980
So big breaths.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.983
Ooh, look it,
that's tension.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.985
Let that go, shake that
thing out.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.612
- Don't touch me.
- Come on.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.781
Let me show you the beauty
of cleaning a pool.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.449
Shall i?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.244
Nice T-shirt.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.829
isn't it ironic?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.831
No, i'm going to
Harvard in the fall.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.249
Yeah, right.

16:00.334 --> 16:00.917
Guess where
i'm going today?

16:01.001 --> 16:03.628
Villefranche-sur-Mer.

16:03.712 --> 16:04.045
That's in France.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.130
That's in Europe.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.257
You ever been
to Europe?

16:08.342 --> 16:11.427
- Yeah.
- You have not.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.554
Hey, guess what i'm getting
when i'm 16?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.473
A BMW 760Li.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.600
That's a $140,000 car.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.893
What do you drive?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.645
Right about now, i'm thinking
about this pool skimmer

16:20.729 --> 16:21.771
through your head.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.274
woman: Bethany.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.111
There you are.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.279
You all packed, honey bun?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.115
You're not my mother,
Caitlin!

16:35.077 --> 16:36.536
And i'm not packed!

16:36.620 --> 16:37.704
Damn it!

16:40.207 --> 16:41.958
- Hi, Roger.
- Hi, Mrs. Stenson.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.209
Ooh, sorry about that.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.836
You excited--
you excited for your trip?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.462
Oh, my God, i haven't been
out of the country

16:46.547 --> 16:47.714
since spring
break senior year.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.590
We were down in Mexico,
got totally drunk off,

16:49.675 --> 16:51.092
like, Jell-O shots,
danced on the bar--

16:51.176 --> 16:53.720
No, i don't care and don't call
me back until this deal is done,

16:53.804 --> 16:54.095
- got it, huh?
- Sounds awesome.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.931
Hey, Roger Dodger.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.224
What's going on, boss?

16:58.308 --> 17:01.227
Do us a favor, keep an eye on
the place while we're gone.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.729
We'll be back
in about six weeks.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.063
Yes, sir.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.691
And here's a little something
extra for your trouble.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.276
Oh, no, you don't have to--
you don't have to--

17:08.360 --> 17:09.027
No, you don't have to
worry about that, sir.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.987
No, here, here,
here you go.

17:13.615 --> 17:14.407
Okay, let's go, sweetheart.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.659
is that a five,
is that a five, sir?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.286
- Yeah.
- Hey.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.663
This should pay for my gas
coming up your driveway.

17:20.748 --> 17:21.122
Uh-huh.

17:21.206 --> 17:24.459
Uh-huh, cocksucker.

17:24.543 --> 17:25.168
Roger!

17:25.252 --> 17:27.128
My fountain isn't spurting.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.922
Can you make it spurt?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.758
Spurting is my specialty.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.718
i'm on my way,
Mrs. Ashmore.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.396
( grunting )

18:09.213 --> 18:11.047
Oh!

18:13.300 --> 18:14.467
Roger!

18:16.470 --> 18:18.221
( coughing )

18:18.305 --> 18:20.556
Hey, what are you doing
swimming?

18:20.641 --> 18:22.100
This is a business,
that is unprofessional.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.230
- Wine cooler, boy?
- Sounds delightful.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.273
Oh, look it--
David's back!

18:29.358 --> 18:30.983
Thanks, Roger!

18:32.945 --> 18:34.570
So this is what
your life is like.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.281
You work for about an hour
and then you sit around

18:37.366 --> 18:39.367
drinking with
half-naked women?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.284
Not always.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.119
Sometimes
they're fully naked.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.081
You weren't
really in Michigan

18:45.165 --> 18:47.667
speaking at an engineering
conference, were you?

18:47.751 --> 18:49.293
No, i actually
just wanted to see

18:49.378 --> 18:51.295
my cousin graduate
valedictorian

18:51.380 --> 18:53.923
and it just so happened to
coincide with PoolCon,

18:54.007 --> 18:55.800
our annual trade show.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.677
( laughing )

18:57.761 --> 18:59.762
Pool cleaners
have trade shows?

18:59.847 --> 19:01.514
Yes, why is that funny?

19:01.598 --> 19:04.559
You have to stay up
with technology.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.602
Look, i know you think
that i have a crap job,

19:06.687 --> 19:09.981
but keeping a pool is a lot
like life, right?

19:10.065 --> 19:11.315
Make sure you
have enough water,

19:11.400 --> 19:12.483
your chemicals are balanced

19:12.568 --> 19:15.820
and you keep the scum away
and you'll be all good.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.665
Good morning, sunshine.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.042
Just another beautiful day
in paradise.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.091
is it me or did the world
just get very dark?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.509
Maybe it's an eclipse.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.053
Has to be a full moon
for an eclipse.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.180
You sure you got
into Harvard?

19:44.391 --> 19:47.351
Ahh, it touched my face.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.395
- Tom, turn the valve on!
- You got it.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.980
Hey.

19:51.064 --> 19:55.067
There's a big tent thing over
my-- my place of residence.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.277
- is that so?
- What's going on?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.112
Vermin infestation, boy.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.114
We gotta
fumigate the building,

20:00.199 --> 20:01.949
we gotta fumigate the whole
building,

20:02.034 --> 20:04.118
right to left
to the top to the bottom.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.661
That sounds toxic.

20:07.080 --> 20:07.246

Hey, hey, get up, man!

20:19.343 --> 20:21.636
Back off, man!

20:22.721 --> 20:24.013
it's the aliens, man!

20:24.097 --> 20:24.639
We didn't pay our
intergalactic taxes

20:24.723 --> 20:26.599
and now they're gassing us!

20:26.683 --> 20:27.850
Snap out of it!

20:27.935 --> 20:29.143
We need to get to Wyoming
to the Devil's Tower.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.436
- And we need mashed potatoes!
- i'll get you out of here.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.812
- We need mashed potatoes, man!
- i got you, man!

20:31.897 --> 20:34.232
i'm talking about mashed
potatoes, mashed potatoes!

20:34.316 --> 20:36.359
The aliens, man, are gonna

20:41.031 --> 20:43.658
That's my cousin,
choking out on the ground.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.701
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.329
You just saved my life, man.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.164
i owe you huge.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.166
- Don't worry about it.
- No.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.834
i will train.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.629
i will be your ward,

21:00.842 --> 21:04.387
Oh, good, 'cause i got
a shift at Applebee's at...

21:04.471 --> 21:05.263
Oh, shit, that's right now.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.390
it's a good thing
that this happened

21:07.474 --> 21:08.599
or i would have been late.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.226
Yeah.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.353

21:12.437 --> 21:13.688

21:13.772 --> 21:14.814
Excuse me?

How long is this
gonna be on here?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.608

- Let's see.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.568
You got 72 hours
for the termites.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.362
You got 36 or so
for the spiders,

21:21.446 --> 21:22.238
then you got
48 for the rats--

21:22.322 --> 21:25.157
What-- what-- what am
i supposed to do?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.075
i have a client at 1 0:00.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.451
i don't know what you're
supposed to do.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.953
You better call your client
and tell him to bring some

21:29.037 --> 21:30.997
chalk or something for y'all can
play some hopscotch on the floor

21:31.081 --> 21:32.290
'cause i don't know
what you're gonna do.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.916
All right, everyone just
relax for one second.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.876
i know a place
we can go and chill out

21:35.961 --> 21:37.962
unless you have
a better option.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.800
Hey, Roger, wait.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.553
Just a-- just a second.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.679
Hey.

21:46.763 --> 21:47.680
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

21:47.764 --> 21:49.015
No, i just--

21:49.099 --> 21:50.850
Look, will you please
talk some sense into him?

21:50.934 --> 21:52.810
- You tell him.
- i'm trying to tell him.

21:52.894 --> 21:53.644
- Roger!
- What?

21:53.729 --> 21:55.521
Roger, this is not
such a good idea.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.190
Yeah, Stenson gave me
five bucks to watch the place.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.320
He-- he gave me the code
in case of emergency.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.447
it's "titties."

22:04.531 --> 22:05.489
isn't that funny?

22:05.574 --> 22:06.324
This isn't really
an emergency, Roger.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.534
it is for me.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.162
Now this i could get used to.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.874
He's got a bad-ass stereo.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.503
( rock music blaring )

22:19.588 --> 22:20.880
Listen to that reverb!

22:20.964 --> 22:22.256
Hey, why don't you just send a
memo to the whole neighborhood

22:22.341 --> 22:24.300
letting them know
we're here?

22:24.384 --> 22:25.676
it's 1 0:00 a.m.

They're either at work,

Oh, my God.

- You have a crush on her.
- What?

25:02.250 --> 25:03.501
No, i don't have
a crush on her.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.212

she's a gorgeous girl.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.588
i do not have
a crush on her!

25:07.672 --> 25:09.465
Okay, fine, you don't
have a crush on her.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.800
it's probably a good thing,
seeing as how

25:11.885 --> 25:13.636
- you just drove her away.

off-guard and--

want to insult you.

How could you eat that?

26:02.978 --> 26:04.311
The body is
your temple, Alex.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.563
You should be very particular
about what you put in it.

26:05.647 --> 26:08.399
isn't that kind of ironic
coming from a--

26:09.568 --> 26:10.609
Wait, no, no, no.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.904
Look, i'm just trying to
understand.

26:13.989 --> 26:17.700
i mean, your temple does get
more worshipers than most.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.493
Yes.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.538
Yes, but i don't
let in just anybody.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.623
You know, they have to
be clean,

26:24.708 --> 26:26.625

take off their shoes.

Most of my clients
don't even want to have sex.

26:35.802 --> 26:38.762

they want to play out, y'know?

Plus, i'm putting away
a lot of money.

26:40.223 --> 26:41.348

do this forever.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.380
Hey, Lin!

28:36.464 --> 28:39.341
i like your boobs!

28:39.426 --> 28:41.093
She has no idea
what i'm saying.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.387
She thinks i'm asking her
what time it is.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.097
But my favorite is Debbie.

28:45.181 --> 28:48.851
Au naturel and built
like a brick shit house.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.394
Wanna know the best part,

28:50.478 --> 28:52.062
other than the fact that they're
all ridiculously hot,

28:52.147 --> 28:52.813
is that as the house,

28:52.897 --> 28:55.774
we get 30% of
whatever they make.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.943
The thing i always forget

28:58.027 --> 29:00.112
is Alex is the world's biggest
pessimist.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.363
i need to talk to you for
a second, get in here.

29:01.448 --> 29:03.949
Why are your
panties all in a bunch?

29:04.033 --> 29:05.159
Are you out of your mind?

29:05.243 --> 29:06.618
i know talent when i see it

29:06.703 --> 29:07.703
and there's a Huggy Bear
in there somewhere.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.122
No, i'm not gonna
become a pimp,

29:10.206 --> 29:11.498
it's incredibly illegal.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.834
So is squatting,
yet here we are.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.295
Only because you
roped me into it.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.880
Okay, look,
you're gonna make some money,

29:17.964 --> 29:19.298
you're gonna pay for Harvard,

29:19.382 --> 29:19.840
you're gonna have
the summer of your life.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.301
No.

29:22.385 --> 29:22.968
i'm gonna continue
cleaning your pools

29:23.052 --> 29:26.054
until i can find
a real job.

29:26.139 --> 29:26.722
Okay.

29:28.850 --> 29:29.808
( buzzer ringing )

29:29.893 --> 29:32.352
That's a mistake, though.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.531

Hey, the pool boy.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.213
Whoa.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.757
- Where's my man, Roger?
- i'm filling in for him.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.009
Frank Priestley, US Army.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.344
- Sure, yeah.
- Retired.

30:05.428 --> 30:06.553
Kind of late,
aren't you, son?

30:06.638 --> 30:07.805
Yeah, it's just been a really
long day, sir, i'm sorry.

30:07.889 --> 30:11.350
Well, my pool shouldn't
take you too long.

30:14.437 --> 30:15.896
i'll be inside
if you need anything.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.189
Yeah.

30:25.448 --> 30:25.781
Hey, cuz.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.866
How was your day?

30:27.951 --> 30:28.951
Oh.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.202
My day was great.

30:30.286 --> 30:31.787
Clogged filters
and then algae that i think

30:31.871 --> 30:33.497
was growing other algae.

30:33.581 --> 30:35.165
isn't that the life?

30:35.250 --> 30:36.917
i'm choosing to think of it
as a case study

30:37.001 --> 30:38.877
on why not to
drop out of college.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.003
How was yours?

30:40.088 --> 30:42.089
Oh, you know,
it was all right.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.132
i mean, we didn't make
that much money,

30:44.217 --> 30:45.968
but other than that,

30:46.052 --> 30:48.595
it was pretty
un-freaking-believable.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.972
Dude, beautiful women
asking me

30:50.056 --> 30:51.849
to apply lotion
all over their bodies

30:51.933 --> 30:54.226
and then to re-tie bikinis.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.311
i had to take off
three pairs of leather pants

30:56.396 --> 30:57.521
and i started snooping around

30:57.605 --> 30:59.398
and i found Stenson's
stash of cigars

30:59.482 --> 31:00.941
and i found some
great porn and his

31:01.025 --> 31:04.152
- Oh!
- Speedo collection.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.362
No, Roger--

31:05.446 --> 31:06.572
is that--

31:06.656 --> 31:09.199
Goddamn it, that is
really unsanitary.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.075
i'm sorry
about that, cousin.

31:10.159 --> 31:12.452
Are you putting your money
in a sock?

31:12.537 --> 31:13.662
Yes, i am.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.330
i would have
put it under the mattress,

31:15.415 --> 31:17.374
but they were all in use.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.959
Genius.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.011
Let me guess.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.305
Japanese guy with a literary
fetish under the bed.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.765
Just me trying to chill.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.518
Running this place is actually
harder than i expected.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.103
i thought Roger was
taking care of all that.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.022
Yeah, well, Roger
is enthusiastic

31:40.106 --> 31:42.983
but he gave two clients the
wrong directions here today

31:43.067 --> 31:45.903
and double-booked Lin
with Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Ramsay.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.739
Luckily, both guys
were into it.

31:48.823 --> 31:50.157
( laughing )

31:50.241 --> 31:51.533
Yeah, it's been so busy.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.952
i actually haven't had time
for a client all day.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.706
Oh, wow,
that's too bad.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.876
You know, um...
if you wanted to help out,

32:00.960 --> 32:03.045
Roger said you've got a real
head for numbers.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.005
Well, i don't wanna brag,

32:05.089 --> 32:06.924
but i did break all
the sales records

32:07.008 --> 32:08.842
as business manager
of the school newspaper

32:08.927 --> 32:10.636
and was runner-up in

32:10.720 --> 32:15.265
the Michigan State
Econ Olympics and...

32:15.350 --> 32:19.186
None of that sounds cool when
you say it out loud.

32:19.270 --> 32:19.895
So good night.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.651
Good night, Alex.

32:28.988 --> 32:32.407
You have been a very,
very bad boy.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.367
Oh, sorry, you scared me
a little bit.

32:33.451 --> 32:35.327
i don't think
we've met, my name's Alex.

32:35.411 --> 32:37.412
You must be one of
Laura's friends.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.538
Or not.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.582
- Did i tell you to talk?
- What?

32:40.667 --> 32:41.625
i don't know what's going--

32:41.709 --> 32:43.418
Oh, ahh!

32:43.503 --> 32:44.002
Are you crazy, lady?

32:44.087 --> 32:46.129
( screaming )

32:46.214 --> 32:48.048
Whoa!

32:48.132 --> 32:49.925
- Stay!
- What are you, sick?

32:50.009 --> 32:51.718
You make me puke.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.096
You pathetic, disgusting,
loathsome,

32:54.180 --> 32:57.015
- shrimp dick excuse of a man.
- Ahh!

32:57.100 --> 33:00.644
You putrid donkey shit!

33:00.728 --> 33:02.270
Roger,
somebody help me!

33:02.355 --> 33:04.064
Bree, stop!

33:04.148 --> 33:05.774
You're in the wrong room!

33:07.026 --> 33:09.027
Oh, my God,
i am so sorry.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.863
i am so sorry,
are you all right?

33:11.948 --> 33:13.365
Here-- here, let me--

33:13.449 --> 33:14.074
Oh, my God.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.203
Oh, my God,
you went to Camp Tamakwa?

33:18.287 --> 33:19.997
i went to Camp Winnepisaqui
right across the lake.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.207
That's where
Sam and i met.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.125
Go, fighting Beavers!

33:26.295 --> 33:28.755
Well, i gotta go do
the whole discipline thing,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.550
so it was really nice
meeting you.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.593
Bye.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.390
Julia!

33:43.896 --> 33:45.355
Oh!

33:45.440 --> 33:47.482
So, so sorry,
i forgot my gimp.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.984
( giggling )

33:55.575 --> 33:56.658
Thanks, Rog.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.160
Those girls are amazing.

33:58.244 --> 34:00.078
i mean, they let me do
the flaming porcupine.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.997
i'm in love-- real love!

34:02.081 --> 34:03.707
Gall dang!

34:04.834 --> 34:07.002
So, Jimbo, maybe we should
pay the piper?

34:07.086 --> 34:08.670
Huh, a little
settle-up time?

34:08.755 --> 34:10.505
Uh, yeah.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.674
See, i'm gonna need
to broker right now,

34:12.759 --> 34:15.218
but we got Modest Mouse playing
at the club tomorrow night.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.804
How about
i hook you up ViP?

34:17.889 --> 34:19.181
Call it even?

34:19.265 --> 34:21.058
Me likey big time.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.768
- Yeah.
- Deal.

34:22.852 --> 34:23.769
Woo!

34:23.853 --> 34:27.022
And you're welcome back
anytime big Jimbo.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.608
Modest Mouse.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.359
( Hedda clearing throat )

34:31.444 --> 34:34.780
Did you just take our services
for a rock concert?

34:34.864 --> 34:36.531
Actually, i would call
Modest Mouse

34:36.616 --> 34:38.867
more emo than rock.

34:38.951 --> 34:40.494
Damn it, Roger,
that is not the point.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.454
Okay, if we're gonna have
this conversation,

34:42.538 --> 34:44.247
you're gonna have to
cover those puppies up.

34:44.332 --> 34:46.625
You know what, we don't do
charity lays, Roger.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.376
This isn't high school.

34:48.461 --> 34:50.212
Goddamn, i went to
the wrong high school.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.678
Roger: Beverly Hills
might seem glamorous,

34:58.763 --> 35:00.055
but you're not
just cleaning hot tubs.

35:00.139 --> 35:03.433
You're cleaning famous
people's hot tubs.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.309
Here's a little secret for you.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.104
Famous people,
in general, are psychos.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.106
( gun cocking )

35:09.190 --> 35:10.816
What the fuck are you
doing on my property?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.234
i'm just here to
clean the pool.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.694
- Let me see your iD.
- My pool-cleaning iD?

35:14.779 --> 35:16.113
Do not be
a smart-ass with me.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.198
i'm a certified member of the
Beverly Hills Police Department.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.158
i have a license to kill
you right now.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.079
Hey.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.372
Aren't you Tom Arnold?

35:25.456 --> 35:27.207
No, i'm
Shaquille fuckin' O'Neal.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.793
- You work for the law?
- i am the law, motherfucker.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.920
And it's not some
honorary thing, either.

35:32.004 --> 35:33.213
i took down a thief.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.048
Okay, he was stealing
one of my plasmas.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.759
My inner hero came out,
i went Rambo on his ass.

35:37.844 --> 35:38.718
You beat him up?

35:38.803 --> 35:40.595
i ran him over
with my Bentley.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.097
And i so impressed the chief
of Police of Beverly Hills

35:42.181 --> 35:43.765
that he gave me this.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.142
There's a lot of weird shit
going on in Beverly Hills

35:45.226 --> 35:46.852
people don't know about.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.228
Now word on the street is
there's a prostitution ring

35:48.312 --> 35:50.772
being run out of this
very neighborhood.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.440
Do you know
anything about that?

35:52.525 --> 35:54.359
No, no, no, i don't know
anything about that.

35:54.443 --> 35:56.111
Damn.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.780
'Cause i'm really
horny...

35:58.865 --> 36:00.198
kinda perverted and...

36:00.283 --> 36:02.159
i'd just like to be
a part of it.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.161
All right, i'm gonna
go do my tantric yoga.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.121
Make me real limber.

36:06.205 --> 36:09.332
in about three weeks,
i'll be able to blow myself.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.376
i may never get
married again.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.794
You clean the pool.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.713
And keep it quiet out here,
all right?

36:14.797 --> 36:15.088
Quiet!

36:21.220 --> 36:23.138
( cell phone ringing )

36:25.391 --> 36:26.766
- Alex Sperling.
- ( gunshot firing )

36:26.851 --> 36:28.768
Shit!

36:28.853 --> 36:31.188
i said no fucking noise!

36:31.272 --> 36:32.439
Roger: You see what i mean?

36:32.523 --> 36:35.650
And Tom Arnold is one of
the well-adjusted ones.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.070
- Here you go, Rog.
- Thanks, Brad.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.453
Hey.

36:46.537 --> 36:47.829
What's up, cuz?

36:47.914 --> 36:49.122
How's the great American job
search going?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.666
Well, i called 1 56 places,

36:51.751 --> 36:53.335
spent 20 minutes dialing,
four hours on hold

36:53.419 --> 36:56.671
and three minutes
being rejected by everyone

36:56.756 --> 36:59.507
and then capped off the day by
being shot at by Tom Arnold.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.092
You didn't get hit,
did you?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.802
- No.
- Oh, you're fine.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.513
How was your day?

37:05.598 --> 37:07.224
My day was terrible,
thank you for asking.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.976
i hung out with five
ridiculously beautiful women.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.854
Can you say
"high maintenance"?

37:12.939 --> 37:15.106
Look, i'm not gonna say that
i'm over my head,

37:15.191 --> 37:18.276
but i might be just
a little bit over my head.

37:18.361 --> 37:21.529
i could really use your help.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.781
Really?

37:22.865 --> 37:24.824
Yes.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.243
- Okay.
- Seriously?

37:26.327 --> 37:28.328
- On one condition.
- Yeah.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.206
Go ahead and name it.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.333
That you help me get the
Westington Scholarship.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.210
And how do i do that?

37:35.294 --> 37:37.629
- By doing what you do best.
- Which is?

37:37.713 --> 37:38.838
Bullshitting.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.423
Oh, i'm very good at
bullshitting.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.217
Yeah, we're gonna make the
scholarship committee think

37:42.301 --> 37:43.468
that i've been working for your

37:43.552 --> 37:45.804
"aquatic engineering firm"
all summer, okay?

37:45.888 --> 37:46.930
And then you can help me
with the paperwork

37:47.014 --> 37:49.182
and the interview and
whatever else i need to do,

37:49.267 --> 37:50.267
but i need to get that
scholarship.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.560
Yeah, that's it?

37:52.645 --> 37:55.522
- Deal?
- Dude, deal, yes.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.315
You kidding me?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.525
Bah!

37:58.609 --> 38:00.318
So now we had
Alex' business sense,

38:00.403 --> 38:02.112
my impressive people skills

38:02.196 --> 38:05.699
and five girls
with majors in humping.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.659
Still, we were missing
something.

38:07.743 --> 38:08.868
Los muscle.

38:08.953 --> 38:09.494
i don't think so.

38:09.578 --> 38:11.538
Hector, we're talking about

38:11.622 --> 38:13.498
a serious business
opportunity here.

38:13.582 --> 38:14.416
Cara de rana, mira.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.751
No thank you.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.212
i have good business
already, man, okay?

38:19.297 --> 38:20.505
Good luck.

38:20.589 --> 38:21.381
You used
the wrong incentive.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.593
We'll help you land
Señora Ashmore.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.019
How would you know that?

38:34.103 --> 38:34.269
¿Que paso?

38:36.314 --> 38:40.358
Rogelio, why would she
go out with me, eh?

38:40.443 --> 38:42.444
i'm a gardener.

38:42.528 --> 38:44.237
You are a gardener.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.614
But you are
muy handsome.

38:46.699 --> 38:49.284
Look, i mean, dude,
she's not that picky.

38:49.368 --> 38:54.080
Yeah, yeah, Hector,
she's a woman, she's lonely.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.957
Yeah, all you need
is some dough.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.251
You upgrade your ride,
you get some new threads,

38:58.336 --> 39:02.172
take her on the kind of date
a woman like that deserves.

39:02.256 --> 39:03.631
Bennigan's?

39:03.716 --> 39:05.717
Olive Garden, baby.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.305
Olive Garden.

39:10.389 --> 39:11.264
We got business!

39:11.349 --> 39:14.142
- All right!
- All right!

39:14.226 --> 39:15.310
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.146
Hold on,
hold on, buddy.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.981
Roger: Just like that,
we were up and running.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.524
Alex laid out
the business plan,

39:21.609 --> 39:24.110
Hector worked security and i--

39:24.195 --> 39:27.489
Well, i did a lot of very
important stuff.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.907
Point is, all of a sudden,

39:28.991 --> 39:30.992
we had a real business
on our hands.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.285
All we needed was clients.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.286
Luckily,
this was Beverly Hills.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.663
You can't throw a rock in
Beverly Hills

39:35.748 --> 39:37.499
without hitting
some horny rich guy.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.250
Yeah, Frank's an okay guy.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.835
i've cleaned
his pool before.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.379
it definitely didn't
look like this.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.963
i think it's
gonna be an easy sale.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.715
Are you sure you don't need
Roger for that?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.175
No, i think
i can handle it.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.259
Oye, mira.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.886
Look, if he decides to
call the police,

39:49.970 --> 39:51.096
you yell out my name, okay?

39:51.180 --> 39:52.389
- Comprendes Mendez?
- Yeah.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.140
Comprendes, "friend-e."

39:54.225 --> 39:55.892
i don't think it's
gonna be a problem, though.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.311
Cuantas veces le has dicho
"comprendes Mendez"

39:58.396 --> 39:59.354
y este no
agarra la palabra?

39:59.438 --> 40:02.357
Esta bonita la casa, no?

40:03.609 --> 40:07.070
Good morning, Frank.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.571
Alex.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.115
What are you doing here?

40:10.574 --> 40:13.535
How many years
you been married, Frank?

40:13.619 --> 40:16.913
Oh, God,
about 20 years, i guess.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.250
Wow.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.293
Sex with one person
for all those years

40:22.378 --> 40:25.171
must be getting pretty--

40:25.256 --> 40:26.673
Well, i don't
wanna say stale.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.674
You can say stale.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.260
Well, i just mean that
after all that time,

40:30.344 --> 40:32.512
you might be
wanting a little variety?

40:32.596 --> 40:36.474
Now, i'm sure your wife is
wonderful, but sometimes,

40:36.559 --> 40:40.562
you're looking for
something different, right?

40:40.646 --> 40:43.273
Are we talking...

40:43.357 --> 40:44.357
a business transaction?

40:44.442 --> 40:46.776
Yeah.

40:46.861 --> 40:49.487
Something clean,
private...

40:49.572 --> 40:52.657
and our little secret.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.576
Oh.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.412
Well, to be honest,
it wouldn't be the first time

40:57.496 --> 40:59.581
- i've done something like this.
- Really?

40:59.665 --> 41:04.043
Yeah, well, back when i was
stationed in Germany--

41:04.128 --> 41:05.545
Well, let's just say

41:05.629 --> 41:08.631
i might have
unloaded some friendly fire.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.217
( laughing )

41:11.302 --> 41:13.511
Well, a man's got to do what
a man's got to do, right?

41:15.514 --> 41:16.431
What the hell?

41:16.515 --> 41:17.515
- i'll do it.
- Great.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.685
Well, we have a few different
options for you,

41:20.769 --> 41:22.687
i mean, depending on
what your preference is.

41:22.771 --> 41:23.980
i would probably go ahead
and recommend

41:24.064 --> 41:27.192
the starter... package.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.485
Ready to deploy
when you are, Private!

41:28.569 --> 41:31.362
Oh, God!

41:31.447 --> 41:32.530
Hector!

41:32.615 --> 41:34.449
- Hector!
- Hector?

41:34.533 --> 41:36.868
All right, this just keeps
getting better and better.

41:36.952 --> 41:38.912
- Two for the price of one.
- No, no, you don't understand.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.371
- Hector's not--
- ( glass shattering )

41:40.456 --> 41:41.748
Oh, my God!
Shit!

41:41.832 --> 41:43.583
i'm so-- oh, i'm really,
really sorry, Frank.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.127
No, it's okay.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.420
The rougher the better!

41:47.505 --> 41:49.547
No, no, no, Frank, there's been
a misunderstanding, okay?

41:49.632 --> 41:51.466
- Hector, please!
- Hey.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.676
You need Hector to go first,
that's cool.

41:53.761 --> 41:54.719
i'm up for whatever.

41:54.803 --> 41:55.845
Pitcher,
catcher, spectator.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.473
Frank, there's gonna be no
ball game of any kind!

41:58.557 --> 42:00.892
So what?

42:00.976 --> 42:03.353
You got the little general
standing at attention

42:03.437 --> 42:04.979
and it's, "Sorry, Frank,

42:05.064 --> 42:06.481
go back to your wife,
Frank"?

42:06.565 --> 42:07.649
it's just that i'm not--

42:07.733 --> 42:10.109
You're just like Gary
from racquetball--

42:10.194 --> 42:11.486
pants down, pussy out!

42:11.570 --> 42:13.488
( groaning )

42:13.572 --> 42:15.782
Oh, yeah, incoming.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.951
Oh, Mexican sneak attack,
i love it!

42:18.035 --> 42:19.369
( yelling )

42:19.537 --> 42:22.372
You didn't know Frank was gay ?

42:22.456 --> 42:24.707
- He's got a wife and two kids.
- So?

42:24.792 --> 42:25.833
That doesn't
mean anything.

42:25.918 --> 42:26.918
This is Beverly Hills.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.586
He probably needed
a tax write-off.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.463
Look, it's okay, one
lost client won't kill us.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.714
What other leads
do you have?

42:31.799 --> 42:33.341
Well, sort of none.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.884
You can use my leads.

42:35.928 --> 42:37.178
Where'd you get those?

42:37.263 --> 42:38.805
What, you think i sit
around all day jerking off

42:38.889 --> 42:40.682
to Caitlin's workout videos?

42:40.766 --> 42:42.559
That took like
a minute and a half.

42:42.643 --> 42:43.893
And then i hit the town.

42:43.978 --> 42:46.145
Country clubs, golf courses,
Porsche dealerships.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.981
Basically, i went
anywhere where rich guys

42:48.065 --> 42:50.066
who don't get laid
hang out.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.693
Thank you, Roger.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.947
Eurasia?

42:56.031 --> 42:57.740
You're like
a little hot ninja.

43:01.787 --> 43:02.662
With my leads,
business really took off.

43:02.746 --> 43:05.623
Within a week, we had to fly
new girls in.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.126
Soon, every room
in the house was rockin'.

43:08.210 --> 43:09.502
And it wasn't just straight
humping either-- no.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.131
We were willing to serve
any pervert with enough money.

43:13.215 --> 43:15.717
You name it, we did it, right on
down to my favorite,

43:15.801 --> 43:18.469
the Algerian wang-a-doodle.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.221
♪ Everything's
all right to say ♪

43:20.306 --> 43:23.933
♪ i'm hoping to not

43:24.018 --> 43:26.436

43:49.793 --> 43:51.669
( dance music blaring )

43:51.754 --> 43:54.255
- Keep pouring those drinks.
- You bet.

43:56.133 --> 43:56.758
Julia, looking good.

43:56.842 --> 43:59.969
What's up, guys?

44:00.054 --> 44:01.679
Hey, make sure you get more
drinks at the bar, guys.

44:01.764 --> 44:04.057
- Come on now, girl!
- Jimmy...

44:04.141 --> 44:07.060
Jimmy is bucking
and soon we'll be fucking!

44:07.144 --> 44:08.978
Hey, Hector, you good?

44:09.063 --> 44:10.688
Come on, French maid,
whip it!

44:10.773 --> 44:11.564
Whip it good!

44:18.947 --> 44:20.281
Hey, he's one of our
best clients.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.491
i know.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.700
- Nice dress, baby.
- Thanks, made it myself.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.619
You guys good,
everything's okay?

44:26.830 --> 44:28.665
- You owe me one.
- Hey.

44:28.749 --> 44:29.707
Are there any rooms in here

44:29.792 --> 44:32.418
that aren't
being used for sex?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.003
Possibly the bedrooms.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.546
Which reminds me,
don't go in the kitchen.

44:35.631 --> 44:37.423
Oh, wait, where are we
supposed to eat?

44:37.508 --> 44:38.800
There's an Easy Oven in
Bethany's room,

44:38.884 --> 44:39.717
but don't take long,
we're about to start a batch

44:39.802 --> 44:42.637
of my famous magic brownies,
all right?

44:42.721 --> 44:45.473
Stop looking at my penis.

44:45.557 --> 44:48.101
Roger, you're a fuck.

44:48.185 --> 44:49.143
Push!

44:49.228 --> 44:50.812
Just keep pushing, push!

44:50.896 --> 44:52.772
- Come on, Alex, we can take--
- ( cell phone ringing )

44:52.856 --> 44:55.650
Just keep pushing,
just keep pushing her!

44:57.778 --> 44:59.570
Yeah?

44:59.655 --> 45:01.572
Alex, you have
the telephone call.

45:01.657 --> 45:02.990
Tell 'em i'm busy!

45:03.075 --> 45:04.742
They say they
call from Africa.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.369
Oh, shit,
that's my parents!

45:06.453 --> 45:07.912
it's my parents!

45:07.996 --> 45:09.747
Oh, you mother and father
of Alex?

45:09.832 --> 45:12.417
Oh, Hedda love Alex.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.502
He's so sweet and so smart.

45:14.586 --> 45:15.628
Here's Alex.

45:15.713 --> 45:16.754
Hedda, Hedda, will you give
me the phone please?

45:16.839 --> 45:17.797
Hiya, Mom, Dad.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.674
Who was that?

45:19.758 --> 45:20.675
That's Hedda,
Roger's office manager.

45:20.759 --> 45:21.759
She's great.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.636
What's up?

45:23.721 --> 45:24.846
Honey, tell him about
the wildebeest.

45:24.930 --> 45:28.057
Your mother wants me to tell
you that we saw a lion

45:28.142 --> 45:30.810
chase down and kill
a defenseless wildebeest.

45:30.894 --> 45:33.396
- How's it going with Roger?
- Tell him about the hippos.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.773
He doesn't wanna
hear about the hippos.

45:35.858 --> 45:37.817
How is it going with
the company?

45:37.901 --> 45:39.193
Oh, it's really good.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.695
Roger's...

45:40.779 --> 45:43.448
He's hands-on.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.282
Alex, i don't have to
remind you

45:44.366 --> 45:45.825
how important
this scholarship is.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.869
Don't worry, i'm not
gonna let you down.

45:47.953 --> 45:50.455
Okay, love you!

45:54.585 --> 45:56.002
is this why you
dropped out of Harvard?

45:56.086 --> 45:58.463
it's effect, my brother,
not a cause.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.091
So did you flunk out?

46:02.176 --> 46:03.885
Dude, i never
flunked anything.

46:03.969 --> 46:07.680
i'm talking about a 4.0,
writing for the "Crimson,"

46:07.765 --> 46:08.890
singing with the Kroaks.

46:08.974 --> 46:11.851
i was the BMOC.

46:11.935 --> 46:12.685
Uhh.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.854
So then why'd you leave?

46:16.648 --> 46:19.484
i don't know,
i just freaked out.

46:19.568 --> 46:22.528
All i was doing was
studying and working

46:22.613 --> 46:23.905
and running on the treadmill

46:23.989 --> 46:27.575
to keep up with all the other
fucked-up overachieving robots.

46:27.659 --> 46:29.702
i hate running on treadmills.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.622
Wow, you're really making me
excited to go, Rog, thanks.

46:32.706 --> 46:34.832
i just want you to enjoy it.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.918
i mean, it may be Harvard,
but it's college, right?

46:37.002 --> 46:42.381
College is supposed to be
the best time of your life.

46:42.466 --> 46:45.593
No, this is the best
time of my life.

46:45.677 --> 46:46.928
Can you imagine
leaving all of this?

46:51.391 --> 46:55.937
"And summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

46:56.021 --> 46:58.940
"Sometime...

46:59.024 --> 47:00.983
"too hot
the eye of heaven shines

47:01.068 --> 47:07.031
and often is his gold
complexion dimmed."

47:07.115 --> 47:07.740
it's tight, right?

47:10.035 --> 47:11.828
What?

47:11.912 --> 47:14.247
it's just Shakespeare's
way of saying

47:14.331 --> 47:15.623
that in a few short weeks,

47:15.707 --> 47:18.626
the Stensons will be home
and you'll be off at Harvard

47:18.710 --> 47:22.964
and i'll be back...
cleaning this pool.

47:23.048 --> 47:26.843
Only with slightly
fewer gambling debts.

47:26.927 --> 47:29.887
i think i liked that better
in Shakespearean form.

47:29.972 --> 47:33.474
Amen, my brother, amen.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.726
You see all the people
on the ship?

47:35.811 --> 47:36.936
Hi!

47:39.648 --> 47:41.983
( toilet flushing )

47:42.067 --> 47:44.694
That was the most elegant dump
i've ever taken.

47:46.697 --> 47:47.822
it's amazing how you Americans

47:47.906 --> 47:49.323
are always
challenging yourself.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.533
Roger: Everything
was going well,

47:50.617 --> 47:51.784
but we knew there was still room
for improvement.

47:51.869 --> 47:55.705
That's why when
the bachelorette party called...

47:55.789 --> 47:58.040
Allow me to introduce to you,

47:58.125 --> 48:00.960
Hector El Fueg-whoa!

48:01.044 --> 48:02.920
Go, go, go, go.

48:03.005 --> 48:07.508
( flamenco music playing )

48:07.593 --> 48:09.135
( grunting )

48:14.349 --> 48:16.517
( groaning )

48:18.437 --> 48:19.478
- Ahh!
- ( shrieking )

48:19.563 --> 48:21.022
Can you feel it,
can you feel it?!

48:21.106 --> 48:23.816
Give him the tushy,
give him the tushy!

48:23.901 --> 48:26.736
- Come on chiquitas.
- Crushed!

48:26.820 --> 48:28.654
( growling )

48:28.739 --> 48:31.282
- That's it, son.
- Get him, get him!

48:31.366 --> 48:33.826
He's hot tonight, ladies.

48:36.121 --> 48:37.747
Crotch rocket, baby.

48:39.374 --> 48:39.832
You will like it!

48:39.917 --> 48:41.918
Ride the pony, girls.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.085
Hey, hey!

48:43.170 --> 48:45.087
( screeching )

48:45.172 --> 48:46.505
Oh!

48:46.590 --> 48:46.923
Give 'em the sex.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.092
( grunting )

48:51.345 --> 48:53.971
After "the flamenco incident,"
as it came to be known,

48:54.056 --> 48:56.682
we decided to stick
with our core competencies.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.309
... but you'll
get used to him.

48:58.393 --> 48:59.602
Oh, and remember,

48:59.686 --> 49:02.355
anything he says,
just go with it, okay?

49:02.439 --> 49:04.398
Mr. Arnold?

49:04.483 --> 49:06.067
We're here to clean your pool.

49:06.151 --> 49:06.943
Stop right there,
you son of a bitch!

49:07.027 --> 49:09.320
( grunting )

49:09.404 --> 49:09.904
No, no, no, no!

49:09.988 --> 49:12.281
Mr. Arnold, please, stop!

49:12.366 --> 49:13.324
Ahh...

49:13.408 --> 49:16.452
Alex, i'm sorry, man,
i didn't recognize you.

49:16.536 --> 49:17.828
i'm really high on mushrooms.

49:17.913 --> 49:18.996
- i'm sorry, Alex.
- Cool.

49:21.833 --> 49:22.917
Those chicks
are hot, man.

49:23.001 --> 49:25.294
They're really hot, man.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.213
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:27.297 --> 49:28.422
Oh...

49:28.507 --> 49:29.298
Whoa.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.550
Am i glad i got my new
defibrillator

49:31.635 --> 49:33.094
after my last
heart attack.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.429
i'm just kidding, i'm kidding.

49:35.514 --> 49:36.889
i'm healthier
than i ever have been.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.599
i swim three laps
in that pool every day

49:38.684 --> 49:40.184
whether i need it or not.

49:40.268 --> 49:42.103
- Tom Arnold.
- Clarissa.

49:42.187 --> 49:43.562
- Clarissa.
- Trish.

49:43.647 --> 49:44.772
Trish.

49:44.856 --> 49:46.023
- You guys are a couple, right?
- Yes.

49:46.108 --> 49:47.984
Yeah, well, i couldn't want to
get your names wrong

49:48.068 --> 49:49.652
in the heat of the battle.

49:49.736 --> 49:52.571
i'm gonna show you
my very own Golden Globe.

49:52.656 --> 49:55.658
i've almost got Roseanne's name
completely scratched off of it.

49:55.742 --> 49:57.493
( glasses clinking )

49:57.577 --> 49:59.745
To us.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.081
How magical.

50:02.165 --> 50:05.084
Another prom night
to remember.

50:05.168 --> 50:08.838
Shall i fetch
the children's menu?

50:08.922 --> 50:10.631
- Joon?
- Lin!

50:10.716 --> 50:12.299
( laughing )

50:13.719 --> 50:18.097
( speaking foreign language )

50:20.600 --> 50:21.809
Girl!

50:21.893 --> 50:24.687
( speaking foreign language )

50:27.190 --> 50:31.277
i'll bring you a nice
bottle of Dom.

50:31.361 --> 50:34.030
All right, Lin, yes!

50:34.114 --> 50:37.450
Dude, i thought you were,
like, Cuban or something.

50:42.247 --> 50:45.207
Damas y caballeros.

50:45.292 --> 50:46.542
Con permiso.

50:46.626 --> 50:47.543
Excuse me.

50:47.627 --> 50:50.379
There is a flower
that needs to be attended.

50:52.591 --> 50:53.883
He is a gardener.

50:57.429 --> 50:59.388
A rose for a rose.

50:59.473 --> 51:01.307
Buenas noches,
Señora Ashmore.

51:01.391 --> 51:03.976
Hector, what a pleasant
surprise.

51:04.061 --> 51:05.144
A beautiful woman
shouldn't be alone.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.648
Will you join me
for dinner tonight?

51:09.733 --> 51:11.192
Oh, i would love to.

51:11.276 --> 51:14.236
This place is really nice,
but i prefer Olive Garden.

51:15.238 --> 51:17.073
- Olive Garden!
- Yeah!

51:17.157 --> 51:19.408
La cuenta, cabrón!

51:28.627 --> 51:30.211
- Thank you.
- For what?

51:30.295 --> 51:33.589
You're actually one of the best
friends i've ever had.

51:36.093 --> 51:37.218
Then thank you.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.723
Although...

51:42.808 --> 51:45.267
What?

51:45.352 --> 51:46.977
Never mind.

51:49.231 --> 51:53.984
it's just that, you know,
best friends,

51:54.069 --> 51:56.195
it's usually not...

51:58.698 --> 52:00.491
You know what i mean.

52:00.575 --> 52:02.118
Yeah.

52:04.371 --> 52:06.122
Hey.

52:06.206 --> 52:09.834
Don't knock friendship.

52:09.918 --> 52:13.963
Finding someone you care
about who cares about you,

52:14.047 --> 52:16.090
that's the hard part.

52:16.174 --> 52:18.134
Okay, maybe Alex had other
things on his mind.

52:18.218 --> 52:21.303
His big interview for
the Westinghouse Scholarship

52:21.388 --> 52:22.721
was the next day,

52:22.806 --> 52:24.849
so while everyone was
sleeping off their hangovers,

52:24.933 --> 52:27.101
we made the downstairs look
legit and professional.

52:29.563 --> 52:30.479
Oh, my God.

52:30.564 --> 52:31.939
Oh, my God, he's here!

52:32.023 --> 52:33.065
Oh, my God,
he's here!

52:33.150 --> 52:35.526
Let him in
and act like a pro!

52:35.610 --> 52:38.070
Not like a pro,
like a secretary!

52:38.155 --> 52:38.737
Shit.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.573
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

52:40.657 --> 52:43.117
Hello, sir,
and welcome to your...

52:43.201 --> 52:47.454
And just when i thought things
were going perfect.

52:47.539 --> 52:50.249
Roger?

52:50.333 --> 52:52.751
What the hell are you doing
here... in my suit?

52:52.836 --> 52:54.753
Oh, my God,
is that my Prada?

52:54.838 --> 52:56.213
- it looks so good on you.
- Thank you.

52:56.298 --> 52:58.174
Caitlin, please.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.258
Bethany,
go to your room.

52:59.342 --> 53:01.385
( blowing raspberry )

53:02.429 --> 53:03.429
Will you do something?

53:03.513 --> 53:06.056
Tucker's gonna be here
any second!

53:06.141 --> 53:07.725
Roger.

53:07.809 --> 53:09.310
Mr. Stenson.

53:09.394 --> 53:11.187
What the hell is
going on here?

53:11.271 --> 53:13.689
( laughing )

53:13.773 --> 53:15.316
There is a...

53:15.400 --> 53:18.277
We are here and we saw...

53:21.364 --> 53:23.365
You're not supposed
to be home yet.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.284
Well, Bethany didn't
like France.

53:25.368 --> 53:27.369
They were all
ruder than she was.

53:27.454 --> 53:28.287
i can see that.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.288
( Bethany screaming )

53:29.372 --> 53:31.207
Bethany!

53:31.291 --> 53:33.042
i'm sure she's fine.

53:33.126 --> 53:33.375
( Bethany screaming )

53:33.460 --> 53:35.127
Daddy, Daddy!

53:35.212 --> 53:38.088
Oh, my God, Daddy,
look what they did!

53:38.173 --> 53:39.340
( screaming )

53:39.424 --> 53:40.466
Bethany!

53:40.550 --> 53:41.634
Oh!

53:41.718 --> 53:43.969
They turned him
into a girl!

53:44.054 --> 53:46.305
Sir, without a penis, it was
really just a matter of time.

53:46.389 --> 53:48.390
They broke my tea set,
bent my baton

53:48.475 --> 53:50.392
and they used
my Easy Oven!

53:50.477 --> 53:53.145
You-- you didn't eat one of
those brownies, did you?

53:53.230 --> 53:54.855
i can eat whatever i want!

53:54.940 --> 53:58.275
it's my oven and it's my
room and it's my...

53:58.360 --> 54:01.028
my... my...

54:02.364 --> 54:04.365
i could so eat the fuck out
of a milk shake right now.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.412
Let's leave
your daddy alone.

54:10.497 --> 54:12.081
You're pretty.

54:14.125 --> 54:16.001
Okay, Mr. Stenson.

54:16.086 --> 54:20.005
Sir, we apologize,
but...

54:20.090 --> 54:21.298
i think there's something that
we could probably work--

54:21.383 --> 54:24.134
Save your breath, kid.

54:24.219 --> 54:28.347
So, considering that
you stole my clothes,

54:28.431 --> 54:31.850
you turned my home into
a whorehouse,

54:31.935 --> 54:33.269
i have one question for you.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.646
- How much you make here?
- What are you talking about?

54:35.730 --> 54:36.939
Spare me, Sperling.

54:37.023 --> 54:39.650
i'm an asshole,
not an idiot.

54:39.734 --> 54:40.359
These girls are hookers, huh?

54:40.443 --> 54:42.194
- Hey.
- You're a hooker, right?

54:42.279 --> 54:44.822
( laughing )

54:44.906 --> 54:46.198
Hey!

54:46.283 --> 54:48.659
- They prefer "escorts."
- Oh, really?

54:48.743 --> 54:55.791
How much did you make?

54:55.875 --> 54:58.168
if i were a couple of stoner
idiots running a brothel,

54:58.253 --> 55:02.298
where would i hide my stash,
i have to ask myself, huh?

55:02.382 --> 55:04.008
So...

55:04.092 --> 55:07.761
Oh, yeah, getting warm,
getting warmer, huh?

55:07.846 --> 55:09.263
i'm hot--
ooh, i'm on fire.

55:09.347 --> 55:11.390
Oh, yeah, i'm right
on the money.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.603
Shit.

55:19.733 --> 55:20.774
What do we got here?

55:20.859 --> 55:22.818
Let's see here.

55:22.902 --> 55:25.237
Oh, the mother lode.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.073
( chuckling )

55:29.534 --> 55:32.995
Now, i'm a businessman,

55:33.079 --> 55:34.747
so i'm gonna
give you a choice.

55:34.831 --> 55:39.126
Option one: i call the cops,
you go to jail.

55:39.210 --> 55:42.421
Option two: you hand over
whatever you made to me.

55:42.505 --> 55:46.133
We can call it rent.

55:46.217 --> 55:47.301
( doorbell ringing )

55:54.559 --> 55:56.810
Excuse me.

55:56.895 --> 55:57.978
i'm not sure
i have the right house.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.980
i'm looking for
Alex Sperling?

56:00.065 --> 56:01.065
Yes.

56:01.149 --> 56:02.274
Hello, i'm Alex Sperling.

56:02.359 --> 56:05.736
Donovan Tucker, Westington
Scholarship Committee.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.154
Absolutely.

56:07.238 --> 56:09.448
This doesn't
taste like cherries.

56:11.534 --> 56:14.078
is she okay?

56:15.997 --> 56:17.414
Sorry, sir,
the whorehouse is closed.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.711
Whorehouse?

56:22.796 --> 56:23.545
i think you misunderstood.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.964
i'm from the Westington
Scholarship

56:26.049 --> 56:26.799
for Business Leadership.

56:26.883 --> 56:29.218
i have an interview
with Alex here.

56:29.302 --> 56:30.344
Oh, we gotta talk.

56:32.889 --> 56:36.100
And that was the end of Alex's
scholarship interview.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.985
i am-- i'm so sorry,
you guys.

56:47.070 --> 56:47.945
Why?

56:48.029 --> 56:49.696
i'm not.

56:49.781 --> 56:52.866
Come on, who needs that guy
and his scholarship?

56:52.951 --> 56:55.285
You know, what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.538
That's Nietzsche, right?

56:57.622 --> 57:00.499
Nietzsche died
syphilitic and insane.

57:00.583 --> 57:03.419
Well, i'm just saying,
this could be a good thing.

57:03.503 --> 57:05.754
Who wants to get on
that treadmill

57:05.839 --> 57:07.589
with those
fucked-up robots anyway?

57:07.674 --> 57:09.174
That's what you said, right?

57:09.259 --> 57:10.926
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, i do.

57:11.010 --> 57:12.553
Come on, we've still got
the clients and the girls.

57:12.637 --> 57:14.555
Alex, i don't
think you fully understand

57:14.639 --> 57:15.722
what just happened here.

57:15.807 --> 57:19.059
This is your life-- Harvard,
your future, everything.

57:20.728 --> 57:21.687
Oh, come on, Laura.

57:21.771 --> 57:23.355
Hey, give her time,
let her go.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.357
Well, what's she
so upset about, man?

57:25.442 --> 57:27.526
i mean, this is the life of
fun and freedom, right?

57:27.610 --> 57:29.653
Not Harvard.

57:29.737 --> 57:31.738
You think this is freedom?

57:31.823 --> 57:33.323
Freedom is
graduating college

57:33.408 --> 57:36.952
and having your pick of
careers, right?

57:37.036 --> 57:40.205
it's income and respect

57:40.290 --> 57:43.208
and choices-- choices,
dude, that's freedom.

57:43.293 --> 57:44.460
And this, this is bullshit.

57:44.544 --> 57:47.045
Look, i can scrounge together
some money

57:47.130 --> 57:48.505
to get you a ticket back--

57:48.590 --> 57:50.007
Why the fuck
should i listen to you?

57:50.091 --> 57:51.925
You've been lying to me
for years

57:52.010 --> 57:53.093
and the fact of the matter is

57:53.178 --> 57:54.970
is that if you would have been
man enough to admit

57:55.054 --> 57:56.138
that you were a pool boy

57:56.222 --> 57:57.556
i'd probably never be out here
in the first place,

57:57.640 --> 57:59.641
because i sure as hell

57:59.726 --> 58:01.560
would never spend my entire
summer with a loser!

58:28.004 --> 58:29.463
Leave the homeless man alone.

58:30.673 --> 58:33.842
Hey, it's my
guardian angel!

58:33.927 --> 58:35.302
What the heck are you
doing here, man?

58:35.386 --> 58:37.262
Come here,
give me some love, bro.

58:37.347 --> 58:39.306
So good to see
you, man.

58:39.390 --> 58:40.390
Hey, guess what?

58:40.475 --> 58:41.391
i learned Mexican.

58:46.481 --> 58:47.439
i gotta tell you, man.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.233
Getting booted out of
that shit-hole apartment,

58:49.317 --> 58:50.609
best thing that ever
happened to me.

58:50.693 --> 58:51.944
Really?

58:52.028 --> 58:53.612
Yeah, i left town and went
and lived a little bit

58:53.696 --> 58:55.155
and i just cleared
the biggest deal

58:55.240 --> 58:56.615
- of my life down in Oaxaca.
- Congratulations.

58:56.699 --> 59:00.619
And it is all
thanks to you, man.

59:00.703 --> 59:04.540
This guy is a lifesaver!

59:04.624 --> 59:05.999
No, seriously, man.

59:06.084 --> 59:07.668
Everybody had written old Eddie
off, but you saved me,

59:07.752 --> 59:09.586
'cause you gave me
the best advice of my life.

59:09.671 --> 59:11.463
Really, what was that?

59:11.548 --> 59:13.298
You said,
"Snap out of it!"

59:13.383 --> 59:14.758
And i was like, fuck, man!

59:14.842 --> 59:16.343
This little bird
here is right.

59:16.427 --> 59:18.512
i gotta grow a pair and man up
my own shit, you know?

59:18.596 --> 59:20.389
Just because you're at
the bottom, doesn't mean

59:20.473 --> 59:21.765
- you're out, right?
- Sure.

59:21.849 --> 59:22.558
if you were at the bottom, you
know which way you're swimming,

59:22.642 --> 59:24.726
- you know what i'm saying?
- What?

59:24.811 --> 59:26.061
Right, puppies?

59:26.145 --> 59:27.813
Hey, i'm gonna go get
strip-searched.

59:27.897 --> 59:29.690
Buenos tacos, man!

59:29.774 --> 59:30.649
What's up, fellas,
how you doing?

59:36.531 --> 59:37.573
He's a good kid, you know.

59:37.657 --> 59:39.199
i mean, he's good-looking
and he's smart.

59:39.284 --> 59:42.119
He's better off than
both of us put together.

59:42.203 --> 59:44.538
- You must be very proud.
- Thanks, Brad.

59:44.622 --> 59:45.664
i don't know if
it's proud, really.

59:45.748 --> 59:47.624
Jealous is more like it.

59:49.961 --> 59:53.338
- i knew you'd be here.
- Speak of the devil.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.465
What, did you come back to
insult me some more?

59:55.550 --> 59:57.342
No.

59:57.427 --> 59:58.969
i apologize, okay?

59:59.053 --> 59:59.720
i was a real asshole.

1:00:02.682 --> 1:00:04.224
Wow, all right.

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:06.518
Apology accepted.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:08.604
So what's up,
you need air fare?

1:00:08.688 --> 1:00:10.188
No, no.

1:00:10.273 --> 1:00:11.648
i'm not going back to Michigan
with my tail between my legs.

1:00:11.733 --> 1:00:15.110
i was thinking, if we get
all the girls together,

1:00:15.194 --> 1:00:16.194
if we get all
the clients together,

1:00:16.279 --> 1:00:17.946
we could make a lot of money.

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:19.740
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:21.783
You know, one good party,

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:24.536
we could make three or four
Harvard tuitions.

1:00:24.621 --> 1:00:26.622
You know what you could do?

1:00:26.706 --> 1:00:28.457
You could make...

1:00:28.541 --> 1:00:31.835
two full tuitions and, like,
killer housing, with books.

1:00:31.919 --> 1:00:33.795
Why would we need two?

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:35.505
Look, they always said to me,

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:38.508
when you're ready to
come back, come back.

1:00:40.928 --> 1:00:43.680
And i'm thinking...
i'm ready.

1:00:43.765 --> 1:00:45.140
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1:00:45.224 --> 1:00:46.224
This is great,
that's great.

1:00:46.309 --> 1:00:47.434
One good party then.

1:00:47.518 --> 1:00:50.771
One big fucking bash.

1:00:50.855 --> 1:00:51.980
- All right.
- All right?

1:00:52.065 --> 1:00:52.689
Yes, let's do it.

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:02.616
Hi.

1:01:04.827 --> 1:01:07.204
So we came up with
a plan to get our money back,

1:01:07.288 --> 1:01:09.289
but we're gonna
need your help.

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:10.457
Don't panic.

1:01:10.541 --> 1:01:12.250
it's like my good friend
Aristotle once said.

1:01:12.335 --> 1:01:15.337

1:01:32.689 --> 1:01:34.606
i have some experience
with bad decisions

1:01:34.691 --> 1:01:36.983
and i was upset
that you weren't

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:40.278
taking your future seriously.

1:01:40.363 --> 1:01:41.822

1:02:38.045 --> 1:02:39.045

1:02:39.130 --> 1:02:41.047
Joon, thank you
so much for coming.

1:02:48.556 --> 1:02:50.140
- Yo, Alex.
- What are you doing here, man?

1:02:50.224 --> 1:02:51.641
i thought you were
in jail.

1:02:51.726 --> 1:02:53.143
Bailed out this morning.

1:02:53.227 --> 1:02:54.644
My dad's the biggest
lawyer in LA.

1:02:54.729 --> 1:02:55.896
Cool.

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:58.482
- Have fun, okay?
- Drinks.

1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:04.029
Hey, have fun, sir.

1:03:04.822 --> 1:03:06.782
Hey!

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:13.789
Oh, get out of here.

1:03:13.873 --> 1:03:16.875
You don't
look so bad yourself.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:20.879
Are you ready to start
this party?

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:23.131
"Hell yeah.

1:03:23.216 --> 1:03:23.757

want me to set up?"

1:03:23.841 --> 1:03:25.926
Uh, out back?

1:03:26.010 --> 1:03:28.428
Okay, good.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:29.721
Good work, boys,
thank you very much.

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:32.057
So you know sign language?

1:03:32.141 --> 1:03:33.391
it's either that

1:03:33.476 --> 1:03:34.392
or i just told our
DJ to steal second base.

1:03:34.477 --> 1:03:37.312
Well, not to be critical,
but our DJ's deaf?

1:03:37.396 --> 1:03:38.772
Beethoven was deaf
every day of his life.

1:03:38.856 --> 1:03:40.857
He rocked out.

1:03:40.942 --> 1:03:43.610
Yeah, but he was
smart and stuff.

1:03:44.028 --> 1:03:45.987
Hey.

1:03:46.072 --> 1:03:47.447

looking for me.

1:03:54.997 --> 1:03:57.207
What's wrong, you okay?

1:03:57.291 --> 1:03:58.750
Roger, Mr. Lewis passed out
halfway through my session.

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:00.836
Do i charge him full price
or half price?

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:04.172
No, double,
charge him double.

1:04:04.257 --> 1:04:05.423

1:04:05.508 --> 1:04:08.051
Okay, good, there you go.

1:04:08.135 --> 1:04:09.803
Mrs. Stenson,
what are you here?

1:04:09.887 --> 1:04:10.804
Are-- are you even
21 years old?

1:04:10.888 --> 1:04:13.890
i know, i'm so sorry.

1:04:13.975 --> 1:04:15.058
i didn't mean to
crash your party,

1:04:15.142 --> 1:04:16.268
but it sounded like
so much fun.

1:04:16.352 --> 1:04:18.645
Don't-- don't touch her.

1:04:22.191 --> 1:04:23.567
Hey, cuz,
what's up, man?

1:04:23.651 --> 1:04:25.443
- This party's banging.
- ¿Alex, Alex, donde estas?

1:04:25.528 --> 1:04:26.528
¿Donde estas?

1:04:26.612 --> 1:04:27.571
Hey, hey, hey,
tut-tut-tut-tut-tut...

1:04:27.655 --> 1:04:29.656
No, no, no, no, no, no,
ta-ta-ta-ta-ta nada!

1:04:29.740 --> 1:04:31.241
The basement is supposed to
be the dungeon

1:04:31.325 --> 1:04:33.118
and this one brought her
first two guys down there.

1:04:33.202 --> 1:04:34.286
( cell phone ringing )

1:04:34.370 --> 1:04:35.954
Roger, answer this.

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:37.205
Hey, ladies,
please, ladies!

1:04:37.290 --> 1:04:38.748
Just, um...

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:39.833
Okay, how about
you take the first

1:04:39.917 --> 1:04:40.834
20 minutes in the dungeon,
you take the second.

1:04:40.918 --> 1:04:42.919
is 20 minutes good, pal?

1:04:43.004 --> 1:04:44.421
That's bullshit!

1:04:44.505 --> 1:04:46.715
Hey, Uncle Marty,
what's going on?

1:04:46.799 --> 1:04:48.258
What's all that noise?

1:04:48.342 --> 1:04:51.261
Oh, just a little
Harvard soiree.

1:04:51.345 --> 1:04:52.929
A couple of the alumni boys
and i thought

1:04:53.014 --> 1:04:54.639
we'd send Alex off right.

1:04:54.724 --> 1:04:56.141
Oh, it's a great idea.

1:04:56.225 --> 1:04:57.475
is James Kellogg there?

1:04:57.560 --> 1:04:58.977
You know, he runs the business
school at Harvard

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:00.645
and he's in town
giving a lecture.

1:05:00.730 --> 1:05:03.231
Yeah, i'm pretty sure
he's not here.

1:05:03.316 --> 1:05:03.982
Bob Knuss there?

1:05:04.066 --> 1:05:06.276
No.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:08.695
Okay, well, look,
don't tell Alex,

1:05:08.779 --> 1:05:10.906
but Nancy and i have
a long layover here in LA

1:05:10.990 --> 1:05:12.908
and we're gonna come by
and surprise you guys.

1:05:15.286 --> 1:05:16.745
Mission accomplished.

1:05:16.829 --> 1:05:18.663
Okay, we'll see you soon.

1:05:19.999 --> 1:05:21.583
He can't wait.

1:05:21.667 --> 1:05:23.084
What the hell
are we gonna do?

1:05:23.169 --> 1:05:25.503
i'm dead, i am dead.

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:27.797
Dude, did i tell
your parents

1:05:27.882 --> 1:05:28.965
that we were
running a brothel?

1:05:29.050 --> 1:05:31.009
Did i tell them that we were
big ol' pimps?

1:05:31.093 --> 1:05:34.930
Did i tell them
anything other than the fact

1:05:35.014 --> 1:05:36.890
that we were having
a Harvard function?

1:05:39.143 --> 1:05:41.603
We could totally do it.

1:05:41.687 --> 1:05:44.189
Okay.

1:05:44.273 --> 1:05:46.191
We can do this.

1:05:46.275 --> 1:05:46.942
We have to do this.

1:05:47.026 --> 1:05:49.319
Hello.

1:05:49.403 --> 1:05:50.654
How's it going?

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:52.113
My name is Roger Sperling,

1:05:52.198 --> 1:05:54.491
i'm one of your host/pimps
for this evening.

1:05:54.575 --> 1:05:56.076
First of all, i wanna
say thank you all so much

1:05:56.160 --> 1:05:58.578
for changing into your Harvard
garb so quickly.

1:05:58.663 --> 1:06:02.040
You all look fantastic and very
stuck-up, so thank you for that.

1:06:02.124 --> 1:06:04.292
A couple points i wanna
talk about tonight.

1:06:04.377 --> 1:06:06.086
it's essential that at any time

1:06:06.170 --> 1:06:08.421
we are outside of
the bang-bang rooms,

1:06:08.506 --> 1:06:10.173
we maintain the Harvard persona,

1:06:10.257 --> 1:06:11.466
'cause we don't
want young Alex

1:06:11.550 --> 1:06:13.593
to get busted by his
parents, okay?

1:06:13.678 --> 1:06:15.053
A couple talking points.

1:06:15.137 --> 1:06:16.930
Your favorite class is
Professor Dougal's

1:06:17.014 --> 1:06:18.390
intro to Psych.

1:06:18.474 --> 1:06:19.224
Everyone loves that class.

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:21.935
You always
played lacrosse, squash

1:06:22.019 --> 1:06:23.687
or ultimate Frisbee
in the quad.

1:06:23.771 --> 1:06:25.063
Any sport that takes
no athletic ability whatsoever,

1:06:25.147 --> 1:06:27.023
you played it.

1:06:27.108 --> 1:06:28.024
And if you run out of
anything to say,

1:06:28.109 --> 1:06:31.569
just talk shit about Yale.

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:32.696
Got it?

1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.614
i mean, it's genetic,
it works every single time.

1:06:34.699 --> 1:06:34.906
Okay, everyone good?

1:06:35.992 --> 1:06:39.703
Uh... yeah.

1:06:39.787 --> 1:06:42.580
Are we still
gonna get laid?

1:06:42.665 --> 1:06:44.082
That's a big fuck yeah.

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:46.668
( cheering )

1:06:49.088 --> 1:06:50.547
- Just...
- You look great.

1:06:50.631 --> 1:06:51.756
Here, you've got...

1:06:51.841 --> 1:06:53.133
They're here, they're here!

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:55.385
They're here!

1:06:55.469 --> 1:06:56.511
What are you wearing?

1:06:56.595 --> 1:06:58.138
That's not Harvard,
that's Berkeley!

1:06:58.222 --> 1:07:00.015
Get out, out, out!

1:07:00.099 --> 1:07:01.307
All right, everyone,
they are here.

1:07:01.392 --> 1:07:02.142
Please look
uptight, thank you.

1:07:02.226 --> 1:07:04.477
There's a huge bulge
in my throat.

1:07:05.229 --> 1:07:07.856
Hi, honey!

1:07:09.316 --> 1:07:11.776
- it's so good to see you.
- Hey, Roger, great to see you.

1:07:11.861 --> 1:07:13.069
- How you doing?
- Hi!

1:07:13.154 --> 1:07:15.113
You survived the wildebeests.

1:07:15.197 --> 1:07:18.616
- Class of '06 or '07?
- Oh, stop it.

1:07:18.701 --> 1:07:19.951
Good to see you.

1:07:20.036 --> 1:07:21.828
Well, this is quite
a mixer, Alex.

1:07:21.912 --> 1:07:23.079
i see you've made quite a few
fans here in Los Angeles.

1:07:23.164 --> 1:07:26.583
Oh, he certainly has.

1:07:26.667 --> 1:07:31.171
Oh, Mom, Dad,
this is Laura, my...

1:07:31.255 --> 1:07:33.298
Girlfriend.

1:07:33.382 --> 1:07:35.341
Yeah, my girlfriend.

1:07:35.426 --> 1:07:38.136
Alex, you never said anything
about a girlfriend.

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:39.429
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:07:39.513 --> 1:07:40.930
Well, what
a radiant young lady.

1:07:41.015 --> 1:07:43.141
i hope you're keeping Alex
on the straight and narrow.

1:07:43.225 --> 1:07:44.100
Actually, it's more
the other way around.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:47.604
Hello, party people!

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:52.108
Jimmy's here, flushed with
dough and ready to roll!

1:07:52.193 --> 1:07:56.780
Fire me up some poontang if
you'd be so kind, my good man.

1:07:56.864 --> 1:08:00.241
Hey, guys, look, it's
Brother Jimmy.

1:08:00.326 --> 1:08:01.951
Brother Jimmy, yeah!

1:08:02.036 --> 1:08:03.328
Fire me up!

1:08:03.412 --> 1:08:06.289
i'll get you another glass of
poontang from the bartender.

1:08:06.373 --> 1:08:09.459
Ooh, i'll have
some poontang.

1:08:09.543 --> 1:08:10.543
Remember, honey?

1:08:10.628 --> 1:08:12.921
Oh, you couldn't get enough
of it in St. Barts.

1:08:13.005 --> 1:08:15.715
it's like
sangria, only pinker.

1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:17.509
The minute it touches
your tongue,

1:08:17.593 --> 1:08:20.053
you get that warm
and fuzzy feeling.

1:08:20.137 --> 1:08:22.430
if anyone would like a taste,
i'd be happy to share mine.

1:08:22.515 --> 1:08:24.224
i'm sure there's enough
poontang

1:08:24.308 --> 1:08:26.976
to go around, sweetheart.

1:08:27.061 --> 1:08:29.104
Listen, Alex, i have invited
some more of my alums,

1:08:29.188 --> 1:08:30.855
i hope you don't mind.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:33.066
No, Dad,
that's be great.

1:08:35.861 --> 1:08:38.029
Excuse me,
is this the Harvard party?

1:08:45.287 --> 1:08:48.665
Does a Yaley suck the cock?

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:53.002
( laughing )

1:08:53.087 --> 1:08:55.004
He certainly does,
oh, yes.

1:08:55.089 --> 1:08:56.548
Oh, mercy.

1:08:56.632 --> 1:08:58.133
You certainly nailed them.

1:08:58.217 --> 1:09:00.176
( laughing )

1:09:00.261 --> 1:09:03.763
James Kellogg, Dean of
Harvard Business, '69.

1:09:03.848 --> 1:09:05.723
Eddie Hettinger, missionary.

1:09:06.308 --> 1:09:08.351
How noble.

1:09:08.435 --> 1:09:11.062
- is this your-- your wife?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:13.022
This is the missus.

1:09:13.107 --> 1:09:17.026
We met in Professor Dougal's
intro to Psych class.

1:09:17.111 --> 1:09:18.695
Oh, Dougal!

1:09:18.779 --> 1:09:20.697
That fat bastard
failed me twice.

1:09:20.781 --> 1:09:24.284
( siren blaring )

1:09:26.036 --> 1:09:27.287
All right.

1:09:27.371 --> 1:09:28.163
Keep this parked
out front.

1:09:28.247 --> 1:09:30.540
if you put one scratch on that,

1:09:30.624 --> 1:09:32.500
i'm having you deported back to
whatever third-world shit hole

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:34.127
you come from, brother.

1:09:34.211 --> 1:09:36.296
i'm-- i'm from New Jersey.

1:09:40.176 --> 1:09:41.259
Sorry.

1:09:41.343 --> 1:09:44.220
Still-- still got
family back there?

1:09:44.305 --> 1:09:45.972
Yeah, of course.

1:09:46.056 --> 1:09:47.265
Oh, God.

1:09:47.349 --> 1:09:49.976
Listen...

1:09:50.060 --> 1:09:52.228
maybe this'll help buy
some of them their freedom,

1:09:52.313 --> 1:09:54.939
at least the women
and children.

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:56.316
Take it.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:09:58.318
Don't be proud.

1:10:00.487 --> 1:10:01.279
Party!

1:10:04.825 --> 1:10:05.325
( Eddie chuckling )

1:10:05.409 --> 1:10:07.452
Kinky.

1:10:09.413 --> 1:10:13.833
Jamie K, answer me
this, bro.

1:10:13.918 --> 1:10:19.130
When a Smurf goes without
having sex for a long time...

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:21.841
what color do his balls turn?

1:10:28.390 --> 1:10:31.351
You know, i spend all day around
the cream of the crop

1:10:31.435 --> 1:10:32.518
of grad students.

1:10:32.603 --> 1:10:35.897
That is the deepest,
the most penetrating observation

1:10:35.981 --> 1:10:37.106
i've heard in years.

1:10:37.191 --> 1:10:37.941
Really?

1:10:38.025 --> 1:10:39.150
'Cause my mom
thinks i'm a slacker.

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:40.193
- No, fuck that bitch.
- Seriously!

1:10:40.277 --> 1:10:42.904
Do you know
that i am the dean,

1:10:42.988 --> 1:10:45.531
the dean of the Harvard
Business School.

1:10:45.616 --> 1:10:46.658
You want to go?

1:10:46.742 --> 1:10:47.200
- Do you?
- Sure.

1:10:47.284 --> 1:10:48.243
You're in!

1:10:48.327 --> 1:10:50.828
( laughing )

1:10:52.873 --> 1:10:54.165
Do you have any peyote?

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:57.335
They asked me, how do i
become a big star like you?

1:10:57.419 --> 1:10:59.545
And i say, "You can take
acting lessons,

1:10:59.630 --> 1:11:00.713
"but that's a waste of money,

1:11:00.798 --> 1:11:02.465
'cause i never took 'em
and look at me."

1:11:02.549 --> 1:11:03.925
What i suggest you two do,

1:11:04.009 --> 1:11:06.970
make a little video,
home video, have some nudity.

1:11:07.054 --> 1:11:10.390
i have a MySpace page under
Hugh Munguspenis, that's me.

1:11:10.474 --> 1:11:11.641
Send it to me,

1:11:11.725 --> 1:11:13.351
- and i'll check it out.
- Hey, Tom, Mr. Arnold,

1:11:13.435 --> 1:11:14.560
i'd like you to meet someone.

1:11:14.645 --> 1:11:16.104
Excuse me.

1:11:16.188 --> 1:11:17.522
Well, well, well.

1:11:17.606 --> 1:11:20.149
What a finely aged
piece of meat we have here.

1:11:20.234 --> 1:11:21.276
i beg your pardon?

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:23.152
i'm Tom Arnold.

1:11:23.237 --> 1:11:25.738
- Tom, that's my mother.
- Mm-hmm.

1:11:25.823 --> 1:11:27.615
Mm-hmm, come here.

1:11:27.700 --> 1:11:29.117
( whispering )

1:11:29.201 --> 1:11:31.953
Um, you know what?

1:11:32.037 --> 1:11:33.663
That's a little sick.

1:11:33.747 --> 1:11:34.789
i'm not one to judge.

1:11:34.873 --> 1:11:36.624
You don't have to
whore-out your mom,

1:11:36.709 --> 1:11:37.417
not at least until midnight.

1:11:37.501 --> 1:11:39.419
She's here for
the Harvard mixer.

1:11:39.503 --> 1:11:41.254
The Harvard mixer?

1:11:41.338 --> 1:11:43.464
- What the hell's that?
- it's...

1:11:43.549 --> 1:11:45.758
a-- a covert operation.

1:11:45.843 --> 1:11:48.261
Everyone's on
a need-to-know basis.

1:11:49.805 --> 1:11:50.638
Okay.

1:11:50.723 --> 1:11:52.390
But keep me better
informed, all right?

1:11:52.474 --> 1:11:55.184
Don't make me
look stupid!

1:11:55.269 --> 1:11:56.227
Come on!

1:11:56.312 --> 1:12:00.023
Mom, Mr. Arnold here
is actually rehearsing

1:12:00.107 --> 1:12:01.232
for a movie role.

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:03.276
isn't that right, Tom?

1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:04.527
No.

1:12:04.611 --> 1:12:07.864
No, Mr. Arnold does not
rehearse for film roles.

1:12:07.948 --> 1:12:11.242
Mr. Arnold becomes his
film roles.

1:12:11.327 --> 1:12:13.244
if you saw my episode of
"Beyond the Actor's Studio,"

1:12:13.329 --> 1:12:15.872
or whatever the fuck
it's called,

1:12:15.956 --> 1:12:18.916
you'd know that i didn't
just play Stanley Stupid,

1:12:19.001 --> 1:12:20.460
i became Stanley Stupid.

1:12:20.544 --> 1:12:22.462
- Howdy, Private.
- Hey, Frank.

1:12:22.546 --> 1:12:25.423
Whoa, Frank, what the hell
are you doing, man?

1:12:25.507 --> 1:12:27.925
i just lost at poker.

1:12:28.010 --> 1:12:30.053
You're playing strip poker
at a Harvard party?

1:12:30.137 --> 1:12:31.888
Strip poker?

1:12:31.972 --> 1:12:32.972
That would have been fun.

1:12:33.057 --> 1:12:34.265
You wouldn't
wanna play, would you?

1:12:34.350 --> 1:12:36.225
No, no, no, no, no, no,
i don't wanna play.

1:12:36.310 --> 1:12:39.020
Just cover it up, okay?

1:12:39.104 --> 1:12:40.271
Fine.

1:12:40.356 --> 1:12:41.522
So the story i heard was that
she could still say

1:12:41.607 --> 1:12:45.318
she's a virgin 'cause she's
only taken it up the butt.

1:12:45.402 --> 1:12:47.362
Something she worked out with
her father, you know, and...

1:12:47.446 --> 1:12:52.158
So tell me, does the
carpet match the drapes?

1:12:52.242 --> 1:12:53.659
Don't tell me,
don't tell me.

1:12:53.744 --> 1:12:54.994
i hope you have carpet.

1:12:55.079 --> 1:12:55.912
i mean, it's okay
if you don't,

1:12:55.996 --> 1:12:57.497
but a lot of
the young gals these days,

1:12:57.581 --> 1:12:59.207
they got none and i miss it.

1:12:59.291 --> 1:13:01.042
i miss carpet.

1:13:01.126 --> 1:13:03.044
Would you please excuse me,
Mr. Arnold?

1:13:03.128 --> 1:13:05.546
i really need to
get some more poontang.

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:10.426
You know, you could have
told me that up-front?

1:13:10.511 --> 1:13:13.513
Hey, Alex, some lady
was looking for you.

1:13:13.597 --> 1:13:14.430
What lady, Eddie?

1:13:14.515 --> 1:13:16.307
Older...

1:13:16.392 --> 1:13:19.143
medium herring...

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:20.186
smell like peaches.

1:13:20.270 --> 1:13:21.104
My mom?

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:23.272
No, no, no, no,
my mom's with Tom Arnold!

1:13:23.357 --> 1:13:25.149
- No, no, no...
- Stroke it, stroke it!

1:13:25.234 --> 1:13:28.194
- Whoa, hey, Tom!
- What, what?

1:13:28.278 --> 1:13:29.529
Tom, what did
you do with my mother?

1:13:29.613 --> 1:13:30.613
Nothing, man,
she's a fucking dyke.

1:13:30.697 --> 1:13:33.699
Hey, where did she go,
where did my mother go?

1:13:33.784 --> 1:13:34.492
i'm guessing she went down.

1:13:34.576 --> 1:13:36.494
You mean down
to the dungeon?

1:13:36.578 --> 1:13:38.788
Whatever they call it,
the furry cave.

1:13:38.872 --> 1:13:40.540
i don't know
what it's called.

1:13:41.542 --> 1:13:43.334
Get him, hit him!

1:13:43.419 --> 1:13:45.878
Yes, good job,
kick his ass!

1:13:45.963 --> 1:13:50.883
( all yelling )

1:13:50.968 --> 1:13:52.427
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

1:13:52.511 --> 1:13:55.513
( all shouting )

1:13:55.597 --> 1:13:58.474
Jesus Palomino!

1:13:58.559 --> 1:13:59.851
Ahh!

1:13:59.935 --> 1:14:01.227
Hey, guys!

1:14:01.478 --> 1:14:04.313
Hey, everybody!

1:14:04.398 --> 1:14:06.983
There's a unicorn fighting
a gimp in the basement!

1:14:07.067 --> 1:14:09.110
( record scratching )

1:14:09.194 --> 1:14:09.652
Let's go!

1:14:09.736 --> 1:14:11.487
( cheers and applause )

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:15.491
Hey, no, hey!

1:14:15.576 --> 1:14:18.244
Hey!

1:14:18.328 --> 1:14:18.744
What are you doing?

1:14:18.829 --> 1:14:20.705
Get off of each other!

1:14:20.789 --> 1:14:22.290
Get money,
get money, get money.

1:14:22.374 --> 1:14:23.666
Hey, knock that shit off!

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:26.127
Yeah, try it, try it,
try it, you bitch!

1:14:26.211 --> 1:14:27.879
Come on,
you little bitch.

1:14:27.963 --> 1:14:30.673
You feeling horny, kid?

1:14:30.757 --> 1:14:32.592
Whoa!

1:14:32.676 --> 1:14:33.468
Unicorn guy!

1:14:33.552 --> 1:14:35.553
Knock the shit off!

1:14:35.637 --> 1:14:37.597
All right, get your
money out, everyone!

1:14:37.681 --> 1:14:39.515
Get your money out!

1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:41.142
$2,000 on Alex!

1:14:41.226 --> 1:14:42.435
i'll take that action!

1:14:42.519 --> 1:14:44.145
- Are you crazy?
- What?

1:14:44.229 --> 1:14:45.855
You can do it, my son.

1:14:45.939 --> 1:14:47.482
As my father
used to say to me...

1:14:55.782 --> 1:14:57.158
Yeah.

1:14:57.242 --> 1:14:59.285
What does that mean?

1:14:59.369 --> 1:15:00.536
it really
doesn't translate.

1:15:02.581 --> 1:15:04.457
Okay, good talk.

1:15:04.541 --> 1:15:07.376
Meet the devil.

1:15:07.461 --> 1:15:07.919
Huh, come on!

1:15:08.003 --> 1:15:09.504
Hey, everyone time out!

1:15:09.588 --> 1:15:12.673
Come on, bring it on.

1:15:12.758 --> 1:15:14.425
Bring it on!

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:16.594
( all cheering )

1:15:16.678 --> 1:15:18.888
Sweep the hoof!

1:15:18.972 --> 1:15:20.556
Come on, i said bring it on,
where is he?

1:15:20.641 --> 1:15:22.725
- Come on!
- ( barking )

1:15:22.809 --> 1:15:24.101
Fist me.

1:15:24.186 --> 1:15:25.770
Oh, that's
supposed to scare me?

1:15:30.317 --> 1:15:31.567
He is calling his shot!

1:15:31.652 --> 1:15:34.987
Roger: This probably wasn't
the best decision of Alex' life,

1:15:35.072 --> 1:15:37.156
not with dear old
Mom and Dad upstairs.

1:15:37.241 --> 1:15:40.243
( whinnying )

1:15:43.664 --> 1:15:45.456
Oh, my!

1:15:47.709 --> 1:15:50.086
( cheering )

1:15:50.170 --> 1:15:51.546
Yeah, whoo!

1:15:51.630 --> 1:15:53.631
( all cheering )

1:15:53.715 --> 1:15:55.883
Yeah!

1:15:55.968 --> 1:15:57.802
And now, the winner...

1:15:57.886 --> 1:15:59.971
by fisting
in the fuzz...

1:16:00.055 --> 1:16:02.473
the victor, the one,
the only...

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:05.017
Alex!

1:16:05.102 --> 1:16:08.062
What the hell
is going on in here?

1:16:10.482 --> 1:16:10.606
Buzzkill.

1:16:10.691 --> 1:16:13.109
Oh!

1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:19.657
Howdy!

1:16:22.578 --> 1:16:23.786
Shit!

1:16:23.870 --> 1:16:25.246
Ouch.

1:16:27.207 --> 1:16:30.585
Sorry i'm late for
the sing-along.

1:16:30.669 --> 1:16:31.544
Anyone know "Fair Harvard"?

1:16:31.628 --> 1:16:34.213
♪ Fair Harvard ♪

1:16:34.298 --> 1:16:38.718
♪ We join in thy
Jubilee throng-- ♪♪

1:16:38.802 --> 1:16:40.803
Zip it!

1:16:40.887 --> 1:16:43.806
Alexander Hamilton Sperling,

1:16:43.890 --> 1:16:45.683
i have never,
in all my life,

1:16:45.767 --> 1:16:49.895
been so humiliated
by my own son!

1:16:49.980 --> 1:16:52.648
Alex, i hope you have a good
explanation for all this.

1:16:52.733 --> 1:16:55.109
Yeah, i do, Dad.

1:16:55.193 --> 1:16:56.319
Mom.

1:16:57.904 --> 1:17:00.072
i'm a pimp.

1:17:00.157 --> 1:17:00.740
What?

1:17:00.824 --> 1:17:03.117
( laughing )

1:17:03.201 --> 1:17:05.786
You-- you're a pimp?

1:17:05.871 --> 1:17:07.538
He's-- he's
putting us on.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:09.457
Oh.

1:17:09.541 --> 1:17:10.541
i mean, come on, Alex.

1:17:10.626 --> 1:17:12.084
if you were a pimp,
there would be prostitutes

1:17:12.169 --> 1:17:14.879
and...

1:17:14.963 --> 1:17:16.005
a dominatrix

1:17:16.089 --> 1:17:18.758
and... sex toys

1:17:18.842 --> 1:17:19.759
and...

1:17:19.843 --> 1:17:22.678
and Tom Arnold
would be here.

1:17:22.763 --> 1:17:25.765
Oh, my God, you are a pimp.

1:17:25.849 --> 1:17:29.101
Are you out of
your fucking mind?!

1:17:29.186 --> 1:17:30.394
Excuse me, folks.

1:17:30.479 --> 1:17:32.938
This looks like one of those
private family--

1:17:33.023 --> 1:17:35.650
You stay!

1:17:35.734 --> 1:17:38.778
Why are lesbians so angry?

1:17:40.238 --> 1:17:41.364
Look, i can explain.

1:17:41.448 --> 1:17:43.407
- You can explain!
- Yes, i can explain.

1:17:43.492 --> 1:17:45.242
Oh, i can't wait
to hear this.

1:17:45.327 --> 1:17:45.951
We'd all like to hear.

1:17:46.036 --> 1:17:50.665
Anybody else
have any plans?

1:17:50.749 --> 1:17:53.167
i lost the Westington
Scholarship.

1:17:53.251 --> 1:17:55.670
Lost the Westington
Scholarship?

1:17:55.754 --> 1:17:57.630
So Roger and i started
this escort service

1:17:57.714 --> 1:17:59.674
but then the guy's
house who we were using,

1:17:59.758 --> 1:18:01.550
he extorted all of
our earnings

1:18:01.635 --> 1:18:03.719
and busted me to
the scholarship committee,

1:18:03.804 --> 1:18:07.807
so we threw this party to
earn back our tuitions.

1:18:07.891 --> 1:18:10.184
What do you mean
"our tuitions"?

1:18:10.268 --> 1:18:11.686
Yeah, Roger's a pool boy

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:12.853
and he dropped out
of Harvard.

1:18:12.938 --> 1:18:15.106
Yeah, but not
in that order.

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:19.485
Whoa.

1:18:19.569 --> 1:18:22.405
( laughing )

1:18:23.407 --> 1:18:25.908
Okay, your mother's hysterical,
are you happy, huh?

1:18:25.992 --> 1:18:28.411
No... come on.

1:18:28.495 --> 1:18:31.455
Nobody's hurt,
the police didn't come and--

1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:32.540
i've made a lot of mistakes,

1:18:32.624 --> 1:18:34.625
but i take full responsibility
for all of 'em.

1:18:34.710 --> 1:18:37.128
isn't that what a Harvard
man does, Uncle M.?

1:18:37.212 --> 1:18:37.670
He's right.

1:18:40.549 --> 1:18:42.967
Honey.

1:18:43.051 --> 1:18:45.803
And you have enough tuition
for both of you?

1:18:45.887 --> 1:18:48.848
Oh, yeah.

1:18:51.351 --> 1:18:52.059
This is a hell of a lot
better than any other

1:18:52.144 --> 1:18:55.271
Harvard party
i've ever been to.

1:18:55.355 --> 1:18:57.440
i guess i'll buy you
another poontang.

1:18:57.524 --> 1:18:58.816
Drinks are on me.

1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:00.860

- How you doing, muchacho man?
- Great.

1:19:21.131 --> 1:19:22.631
So you need anything,
food, water?

1:19:22.716 --> 1:19:24.383
No thanks, Hector.

1:19:24.468 --> 1:19:25.885
i'm doing really well.

1:19:25.969 --> 1:19:27.636
Hey, me too.

1:19:29.431 --> 1:19:31.515
Or not.

1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:33.851
All right, you two
are a lovely couple.

1:19:33.935 --> 1:19:35.603
Sperling,
i wanna talk to you.

1:19:35.687 --> 1:19:36.604
Bye.

1:19:36.688 --> 1:19:37.730
i'm a little busy now.

1:19:37.814 --> 1:19:39.064
You're gonna have to find
somebody else to extort.

1:19:39.149 --> 1:19:40.483
Screw you, Sperling,
i'm looking for my wife.

1:19:40.567 --> 1:19:43.152
- i know she's here somewhere.
- Why, did her babysitter call?

1:19:43.236 --> 1:19:46.322
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't fuck with me, Sperling.

1:19:46.406 --> 1:19:48.783
You're right, i apologize.

1:19:48.867 --> 1:19:49.784
Man, i'm gonna show you
the kind of respect

1:19:49.868 --> 1:19:51.911
that you deserve.

1:19:51.995 --> 1:19:53.746
Your wife is there.

1:19:55.081 --> 1:19:57.291
- Marco!
- Polo!

1:19:57.375 --> 1:19:59.084
Hey, honey!

1:19:59.169 --> 1:20:02.254
Get your Speedos, we're
gonna play some volleyball.

1:20:02.339 --> 1:20:04.215
( cell phone camera clicking )

1:20:04.299 --> 1:20:05.925
i've been looking for something
to put on my Christmas card.

1:20:06.009 --> 1:20:08.385
Now, how much do you think
it's gonna cost you to pay me

1:20:08.470 --> 1:20:09.929
not to send that out to
all of my clients?

1:20:10.013 --> 1:20:12.056
Have you met Jimmy?

1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:12.807
Hey, Jimmy Black, sir.

1:20:12.891 --> 1:20:15.935
Your wife's got
beautiful thighs.

1:20:16.019 --> 1:20:17.853
You know...

1:20:17.938 --> 1:20:19.355
Hey, Bethany!

1:20:19.439 --> 1:20:20.523
Hi, Sweetie!

1:20:20.607 --> 1:20:21.482
Aw...

1:20:21.566 --> 1:20:24.151
- Bring it, Bethany!
- Hey, Daddy, look!

1:20:24.236 --> 1:20:26.070
We're jamming!

1:20:27.906 --> 1:20:30.616
Would you take a check?

1:20:30.700 --> 1:20:32.159
Actually, i prefer cash.

1:20:32.244 --> 1:20:36.080
Unmarked, nonsequential
and in a big sock.

1:20:36.164 --> 1:20:38.165
Be right back.

1:20:38.250 --> 1:20:39.416
Great.

1:20:39.501 --> 1:20:41.001
So you're a pool boy?

1:20:41.086 --> 1:20:42.962
Really more of
a pool man.

1:20:43.046 --> 1:20:46.257
- What's that pay?
- Not as well as pimping.

1:20:46.341 --> 1:20:48.509
Too soon for that?

1:20:48.593 --> 1:20:50.261
A bit.

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:52.888
So, Alex, this whole
furry-costume-fetish thing,

1:20:52.973 --> 1:20:56.433
is that because we threw out
all your stuffed animals?

1:20:56.518 --> 1:20:57.518
What?

1:20:57.602 --> 1:20:59.186
No, i'm not into that,
i'm a virgin.

1:20:59.271 --> 1:21:02.106
Oh, honey, we gotta fix that
before you to go to college.

1:21:04.025 --> 1:21:05.192
Bye.

1:21:06.653 --> 1:21:07.570
Dad.

1:21:09.906 --> 1:21:12.867
i still think Harvard's lucky
to be getting you, son.

1:21:12.951 --> 1:21:14.618
Thank you, sir.

1:21:14.703 --> 1:21:16.120
Roger, i can't
say the same for you.

1:21:16.204 --> 1:21:18.998
Oh, i love you,
too, Uncle M.

1:21:19.082 --> 1:21:20.958
Hey, thanks for
not calling the cops.

1:21:21.042 --> 1:21:22.209
Good luck.

1:21:25.505 --> 1:21:27.423
it really sucks this thing's
coming to an end, right?

1:21:27.507 --> 1:21:28.799
i mean, this thing
is really going now.

1:21:28.884 --> 1:21:31.218
We got something
good here.

1:21:31.303 --> 1:21:32.928
You know,
i could take over.

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:37.224
Your girlfriend has, like,
a billion dollars.

1:21:37.309 --> 1:21:39.351
Yes, i know,

1:21:39.436 --> 1:21:42.980
but i think it's important for
me to have my own career.

1:21:43.064 --> 1:21:45.107
Good night, my friends.

1:21:45.191 --> 1:21:45.900
Good night, Joon.

1:21:45.984 --> 1:21:49.069
Domo arigato.

1:21:49.154 --> 1:21:51.697
Good night, Private.

1:21:51.781 --> 1:21:52.865
What a handsome couple, huh?

1:21:52.949 --> 1:21:56.827
Oh, shit!

1:21:56.912 --> 1:21:59.163
That's a whole lot of ass
he just grabbed.

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:01.874
Wait a second.

1:22:01.958 --> 1:22:03.918
Am i the only one at the party
not getting laid?

1:22:04.002 --> 1:22:05.044
( whistling )

1:22:09.382 --> 1:22:11.550
You are a naughty girl.

1:22:11.635 --> 1:22:13.928
You talk to your mother
with those hands?

1:22:17.891 --> 1:22:19.975
Ladies and gentlemen,
i'm gonna say good night.

1:22:21.603 --> 1:22:23.228
Pimpin' ain't easy.

1:22:31.154 --> 1:22:35.824
So the party's
pretty much over.

1:22:35.909 --> 1:22:38.577
i'm not a pimp anymore.

1:22:38.662 --> 1:22:40.913
Which means your rules
no longer apply?

1:22:40.997 --> 1:22:42.998
Such as...

1:22:43.083 --> 1:22:44.708
No sex with the girls.

1:22:46.211 --> 1:22:49.588
♪ i know
oh you said it... ♪

1:22:49.673 --> 1:22:52.383
Roger: Holy shit,
the kid finally got laid.

1:22:52.467 --> 1:22:54.635
♪ i'm not your savior ♪

1:22:54.719 --> 1:22:57.346
♪ i didn't die
for you... ♪♪

1:22:57.430 --> 1:22:58.180
Laura stocked
enough money away

1:22:58.264 --> 1:23:00.849
to quit the escort
business forever.

1:23:00.934 --> 1:23:03.519
She came out to Boston
and opened up her own day spa.

1:23:03.603 --> 1:23:06.271
Alex and i, well, we started
at Harvard.

1:23:06.356 --> 1:23:08.691
it took a while,
but we finally made it.

1:23:08.775 --> 1:23:10.109
This is one of the finest
institutions

1:23:10.193 --> 1:23:11.986
of higher learning
in the free world.

1:23:12.070 --> 1:23:14.863
i mean, they don't let just
anyone into this place.

1:23:14.948 --> 1:23:15.572
Hey, guys!

1:23:15.657 --> 1:23:17.408
- Thank God i found you.
- Eddie?

1:23:17.492 --> 1:23:20.160
Listen, Mather House is
having a huge bash this Friday,

1:23:20.245 --> 1:23:21.745
so we need some serious
tail for that.

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:23.580
Also, i got tons
of alum coming in

1:23:23.665 --> 1:23:24.873
for the game this weekend

1:23:24.958 --> 1:23:26.291
and i've been selling Viagra
by the truckload,

1:23:26.376 --> 1:23:27.626
so i'm gonna need like
four or five escorts--

1:23:27.711 --> 1:23:28.919
No, Eddie,
we can't do that.

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:30.629
Damn right you can't.

1:23:30.714 --> 1:23:31.839
What are you
thinking, young man?

1:23:31.923 --> 1:23:34.091
We need every girl you've got
for the faculty mixer.

1:23:34.175 --> 1:23:36.760
Oh, let's make a shopping list.

1:23:39.472 --> 1:23:41.765
You know, they may actually
have something there.

1:23:41.850 --> 1:23:43.225
You think?

1:23:43.309 --> 1:23:45.185
i'm just saying.

1:23:45.270 --> 1:23:46.937
Got a rich environment.

1:23:47.022 --> 1:23:48.480
Look around, Roger.

1:23:48.565 --> 1:23:50.816
Our girls would
make a fortune here.

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:53.318
Y'know, Alex, Alex,
seriously, i was kidding...

1:23:53.403 --> 1:23:54.528
it wasn't a bad idea.

1:23:54.612 --> 1:23:55.946
i mean, there's
money in Beverly Hills,

1:23:56.031 --> 1:23:58.407
but there's old money in Boston.

1:23:58.491 --> 1:24:00.617
With Alex business sense,
my people skills

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:04.455
and Laura's girls,
i figured we could make a mint.

1:24:04.539 --> 1:24:06.248
i know it was risky
in the legal,

1:24:06.332 --> 1:24:07.958
but sometimes you
just have to ask yourself,

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:10.335
