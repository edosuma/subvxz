Previously onSWAT...Looking good, Brianna.

00:04.047 --> 00:05.657
Just give your brother a hug.[laughs]

00:05.701 --> 00:07.703
I'm looking to moonlight
for some extra cash.

00:07.746 --> 00:10.097
Being a good Catholic sounds
expensive, man.DEACON: Tell me about it.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.621
LUCA: Thinking about doing that
good neighbor house program.

00:12.664 --> 00:13.709
HICKS: You see the neighborhood
this is in?

00:13.752 --> 00:15.537
LUCA:
I could fix this place up.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.234
I got this new house
in East Hollywood.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.280
So are we gonna bunk
together again or what?

00:19.323 --> 00:20.411
HONDO:
I'm just the guy she's using

00:20.455 --> 00:22.326
to get from you to the guy

00:22.370 --> 00:24.415
that she's eventually
gonna end up with.
And we're both good with it.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.069
[siren wails]

00:26.113 --> 00:28.811
Just tell him you're a cop.You and I both know

00:28.854 --> 00:30.291
exactly what's
going on here.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.597
That fool had the nerve to act
like I was the one

00:32.641 --> 00:33.511
making it about race.

00:33.555 --> 00:35.078
I wanted to beat his ass.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.558
That anger I saw in Tucson

00:36.601 --> 00:38.908
was not just about that ass
of a traffic cop.

00:38.951 --> 00:41.432
There's no way that one guy
got you wound up like that.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.434
There has to be more.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.877
[chuckles]

00:51.921 --> 00:55.229
Hey, Cinderella.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.622
You looking for this?

00:57.666 --> 01:01.931
What I love about hotels is
if you leave something behind,

01:01.974 --> 01:03.585
you just call
the front desk.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.587
No awkward conversation.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.892
Oh, I know that game.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.503
Like you're just looking
for an excuse to call

01:08.546 --> 01:10.113
after a night
of sinful activity.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.723
No, I would never assume that
about you.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.116
I know you better than that.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.552
Mm. Kiss of death.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.163
Mystery's all gone for us.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.643
Only from the neck down.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.775
[laughs softly]

01:19.818 --> 01:21.211
Drop off the key
on your way out?

01:21.255 --> 01:22.212
Roger that.

Brie? What's up? It's late.BRIANNA: Hondo.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.443
I need help.What's wrong?

01:35.486 --> 01:36.444
Where are you?

01:36.487 --> 01:39.273
I'm, uh, I'm at a club. Uh...

01:41.013 --> 01:42.667
I think this guy
put something in my drink.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.452
I... I don't feel good, Hondo.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.367
Brianna, you listen to me.
Find someplace safe.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.195
A bathroom. Somewhere
where you can lock the door.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.414
I was with my friend
but she already went home.

01:52.460 --> 01:53.635
Hondo, he's coming.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.636
Tell me where you are.

01:54.679 --> 01:56.028

[dance music playing]

02:23.578 --> 02:25.710
Ladies. Sorry, I'm LAPD.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.713
Brie? Brie, are you in here?

02:28.757 --> 02:31.325
Brie.All right.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.587

My bad.

02:42.684 --> 02:46.209
Wake up, Brie.

Brie, can you hear me?

02:49.386 --> 02:52.128
Wake up.
[panting]

02:57.742 --> 03:00.092
MAN:
At this point, we don't know.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.877
Hold on a second.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.575
Brie, you're okay.Hmm.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.055
They're gonna take you in
and get you checked out.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.274
I'll be right behind.

03:07.317 --> 03:09.319
[moans softly]

03:17.022 --> 03:18.502
Hey.

03:18.546 --> 03:19.851
Do you remember
serving her tonight?

03:19.895 --> 03:21.026
I serve a lot of people.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.506
Does this place have
security cameras?

03:22.550 --> 03:24.552
Not inside.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.510
You know her drink?

03:26.554 --> 03:28.469
I remember drinks, not faces.

03:28.512 --> 03:31.907
Yeah. Yeah, um,
uh, rum and ginger ale.

03:31.950 --> 03:33.691
Yeah, squeeze of lime.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.911
Yeah, guy she was with
ordered a Harvey Wallbanger.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.304
Anything else about him?

03:37.347 --> 03:38.653
Kind of average, white.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.784
He pay with a card or cash?

03:39.828 --> 03:40.829
Cash.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.700
He tipped me a quarter.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.658
Hipsters, man.

03:47.139 --> 03:48.489
TAN: Annie okay you're
working on your day off,

03:48.532 --> 03:49.707
so close to her due date?

03:49.751 --> 03:51.056
DEACON: We could use
the extra cash.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.710
I was supposed to spend
the day with Bonnie.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.495
She planned this whole
anniversary picnic thing.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.018
Did you ask the captain?

03:56.061 --> 03:57.715
I'm sure she could get
someone else to fill in.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.674
I dodged the first round of
demotions, but bosses tell me

03:59.717 --> 04:01.110
to jump right now,
I say "how high?"

04:01.153 --> 04:02.720
Got to prove my worth
in case they decide

04:02.764 --> 04:04.896
to bump even more officers
back down to patrol.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.378
Hey. Look who got called up
to the big leagues.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.989
Hope they can keep up.We'll do our best.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.905
Okay, with the flu going around,
we're down ten officers.

04:13.949 --> 04:17.169
Deacon, Tan, thanks for
filling in on short notice.

04:17.213 --> 04:20.651
Happy to be here, Cap.Well, I appreciate it.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.610
Let's hope for a quiet day.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.745
Wow, I had no clue this place
needed so much work.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.834
I thought it'd take a couple
hours, and I'd be done in time

04:29.878 --> 04:31.227
to hike Solstice Canyon.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.577
Well, look on the bright side.
At least we saved you

04:33.621 --> 04:34.970
from getting eaten
by a mountain lion.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.537
Hey, I figure we
start right here,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.539
and get this ready for
the flat-screen TV.

04:38.582 --> 04:39.627
You're not-you're not
just gonna paint

04:39.670 --> 04:41.193
over those holes,
are you?

04:41.237 --> 04:44.022
No, I know that.
I bought spackling paste for it.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.024
Spackle, for that?Yeah.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.809
No, man, you need a new drywall
to patch that.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.767
Then you have to
sand and prime

04:49.811 --> 04:51.378
before you even think
about painting.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.640
And you can't do any of that

04:52.683 --> 04:54.642
until you fix
all these roof leaks.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.252
How do you both
not know this stuff?

04:56.296 --> 04:57.514
LUCA: 'Cause I rented
all my life. If something

04:57.558 --> 04:59.211
needed to get fixed,
I just called the super.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.692
What about you?No good excuse, really.

05:01.736 --> 05:05.261
Okay, so you can field-strip
and clean an HK blindfolded

05:05.305 --> 05:07.307
but you guys don't know
how to paint a wall?

05:07.350 --> 05:08.395
LUCA:
Yeah.
No.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.659
I'm gonna see
if my uncle can spare

05:11.702 --> 05:13.661
a couple of guys
from his construction crew.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.924
Yeah.You owe me, though.

We want the good stuff.
Open the safe.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.070
Witness says they're barricaded
inside with three hostages.

Okay. Thanks.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.233
Well, I was hoping to make
the bean counters happy,

06:48.277 --> 06:50.148
save some money, but scratch
that, we're going in.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.454
Back door's obstructed

06:51.498 --> 06:52.760
We'll cite them
after we save them.

06:52.803 --> 06:53.935
So, uh, what
are you thinking?

06:53.978 --> 06:55.110
Front entry? Breach and bang?

06:55.153 --> 06:56.851
Breach and bang, yes;
front entry, no.

Hey. There's blood.
Are you hurt?

07:44.115 --> 07:45.465

and a new bride?

08:09.924 --> 08:12.317
Yeah, I think he's gonna be able
to afford it in about 20 years.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.667
[chuckles]

08:13.710 --> 08:15.277
That male hostage look
familiar to you?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.670
I don't think so. Why?

08:16.713 --> 08:18.106
I know him from somewhere.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.761
Wanted poster, maybe?

08:20.804 --> 08:23.720
Screw me. That's Charlie Moss.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.592
Who?Charlie Moss,
he-he killed three people

08:25.635 --> 08:27.507
at a tech company
in San Francisco last year.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.812
He's been on
the Most Wanted list.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.335
This is one of the hostages?

08:30.379 --> 08:31.989
That's him. Detective.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.296
Where's that hostage
you were talking to?

08:34.339 --> 08:35.732
I think he went
to make a phone call.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.952
Around the corner,
by the ambulance.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.523
Paramedic wagon's gone.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.786
Grab an EMT.

â™ª

09:32.093 --> 09:34.008
TAN: We thought he was
just an innocent hostage.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.879
JESSICA:
The fugitive is Charlie Moss.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.447
Wanted on three counts
of murder, plus one attempted.

09:38.490 --> 09:41.711
Statewide manhunt last year,
then he vanished. Until today.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.540
The ambulance was abandoned
ten blocks from the pharmacy.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.760
No witnesses,
no sign of Charlie.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.283
The original victims
were three senior veeps

09:48.326 --> 09:51.329
from Arcura Technology,
plus the CEO, who survived.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.854
Charlie claimed they stole
his idea for an app.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.072
He sued, he lost.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.378
He thought he would
make millions.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.641
Ended up bankrupt instead.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.121
So he murdered them for revenge.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.688
Why didn't I know about him?

10:01.731 --> 10:04.299
Check the fugitive bulletins
once in a while, okay?

10:04.342 --> 10:05.648
His nickname was
the Silicon Slasher.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.258
He used to wait down
in the parking garage,

10:07.302 --> 10:09.652
till they came down for their
cars and slashed their throats.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.088
Lucky Mumford recognized him

10:11.132 --> 10:12.481
at the pharmacy today.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.569
What's he doing in L.A.?

10:13.613 --> 10:14.918
Arcura moved headquarters

10:14.962 --> 10:16.703
from San Francisco
to Playa Vista.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.313
The CEO is based
down here now.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.358
His name is Martin Dunst.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.577
Yeah. He's the only
one that Charlie

10:21.621 --> 10:22.883
didn't finish off
the first time.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.188
You think Charlie's
taking another run at him?

10:24.232 --> 10:25.799
Somebody that angry

10:25.842 --> 10:27.801
doesn't suddenly
go all Zen Buddha.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.064
Get your team
over to their offices.All right.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.340
Is she okay?
Yes.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.647
But she's gonna have
a monster hangover,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.170
side effects of Rohypnol.

10:49.213 --> 10:50.998
She's lucky.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.652
Most times I'm ordering
a rape kit.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.002
Is she awake? Can I talk to her?

10:55.045 --> 10:56.090
Yeah, yeah.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.439
Thank you, Doc.Yeah.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.450
Hey.

11:08.493 --> 11:10.017
What happened?

11:10.060 --> 11:12.846
You fell in the bathroom at
the club and you hit your head,

11:12.889 --> 11:14.108
but that's all.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.023
The guy who was
after you

11:16.066 --> 11:17.633
never made it
through that door.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.026
Thank you.Come on now,

11:19.069 --> 11:20.201
what are big brothers for?

11:20.244 --> 11:22.377
[chuckles]

11:23.900 --> 11:26.033
Don't tell Dad, please.

11:26.076 --> 11:30.515
He worries about me even more
than I worry about him.

11:30.559 --> 11:34.215
I don't know why I put
my drink down. I know the rules.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.086
No, come on, Brie,
don't do that.

11:36.130 --> 11:38.132
Don't blame yourself
for any of this, you hear me?

11:38.175 --> 11:41.004
Just tell me
what happened.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.747
Uh...

11:44.791 --> 11:48.272
This guy, he was hitting on me.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.883
Um...

11:49.926 --> 11:53.974
He wanted to buy me a drink.
I wasn't interested, but, um...

11:54.017 --> 11:55.540
I think he did it.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.977
Did you get his name?

11:57.020 --> 11:59.414
Everything is so fuzzy. Um...

11:59.457 --> 12:02.199
Liam.

12:02.243 --> 12:05.420
I think he said
his name was Liam.

12:05.463 --> 12:08.162
BARKER:
Three rapes,

12:08.205 --> 12:11.339
same neighborhood,
all in the last month.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.211
Victims got roofied,
assaulted, and left in alleys.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.691
And no leads?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.085
No DNA match yet,
no witnesses,

12:18.128 --> 12:20.957
no victim with a clear memory
of what happened to them.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.394
Well, there's no such thing
as a perfect crime.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.485
I get this is
important to you,

12:27.529 --> 12:29.836
and I'm busting my ass
trying to catch this guy,

12:29.879 --> 12:32.273
but I've also got 20 other cases
assigned to me.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.709
I understand.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.885
Would you mind if I talk
to the other victims myself?

12:35.929 --> 12:37.234
Share whatever I find.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.453
One woman's gone
back to France,

12:38.496 --> 12:39.846
one's fallen off the radar,

12:39.889 --> 12:42.022
and the third one's
done talking to us.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.458
Nothing more we can do
except wait

12:43.501 --> 12:44.764
for this guy to make a mistake.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.679
Well, he already did.
He went after my sister.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.687
CHRIS:
Luca, Street,

12:55.731 --> 12:57.777
you remember my Uncle Sarzo
and my cousin Tomas, right?

12:57.820 --> 12:59.343
Hey, what's up?
Thanks for coming, man.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.171
Hey, good to see you.How are you, bro?

13:01.215 --> 13:02.259
How are you?

13:02.303 --> 13:03.826
So what do you think?

13:03.870 --> 13:06.176
Maybe you can still
cancel the sale.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.874
Oh, hell no, man,
this is a great deal.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.137
This is part of
the city program for cops.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.269
You pay a quarter
of the listing price.
Yeah.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.315
Unless you paid a dollar,
they overcharged you, dude.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.533
We've handled worse.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.797
Remember that house
in Boyle Heights?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.755
Yeah, we-we solved that
with a bulldozer.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.931
Dude...Can we get
started, please?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.237
Yeah, thank you.
I appreciate it.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.369
You can thank Chris.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.197
We're just paying her
back a favor.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.633
Favor?

13:28.677 --> 13:32.028
First, we're gonna need to,
uh, get some new drywall,

13:32.072 --> 13:34.291
then we need to sand and prime

13:34.335 --> 13:35.553
before we can paint.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.728
Yeah, she already
told us that.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.209
You pick out
a color at least?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.255
I always recommend
Navajo White.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.129
Thanks for giving up
your lunch break.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.001
Of course.
How's your sister?

13:48.044 --> 13:49.611
Doctor says
she was lucky,

13:49.654 --> 13:51.961
but I can't stop thinking about
what almost happened to her.

13:52.005 --> 13:55.399
She is lucky. She has
you for a brother.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.227
Technically,
I'm her half-brother.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.882
She grew up in Oakland,
so I wasn't able to be there

13:59.926 --> 14:02.276
for her the way I'd like
when she was growing up,

14:02.319 --> 14:04.278
so I'm doing my best
for her now.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.193
So how can I help?

14:06.236 --> 14:08.543
If this other woman was
a victim of the same guy,

14:08.586 --> 14:10.632
she might be able
to help us ID him,

14:10.675 --> 14:13.200
but I figured it might be easier
for her to talk to you,

14:13.243 --> 14:14.592
as another woman.

14:14.636 --> 14:18.205
Maybe, but even if you manage
to track him down,

14:18.248 --> 14:19.771
what are you gonna do?

14:19.815 --> 14:22.296
Short of this guy
rolling over and confessing,

14:22.339 --> 14:24.211
there's no proof.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.083
You know how many rapists
out of 1,000 even get arrested?

14:27.127 --> 14:29.433
Around 60.

14:29.477 --> 14:32.306
You know how many actually
get convicted? Seven.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.351
Well, I'm gonna make sure
he's one of those seven.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.281
Did you know this place
even existed?

14:51.325 --> 14:53.109
Yeah, Silicon Beach.

14:53.153 --> 14:56.330
Over 500 tech start-ups
based around here.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.375
I got a couple friends from
high school working nearby.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.421
Sold their first start-up
for $20 mil.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.423
Heads up, buddy.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.251
Just think, if you
hadn't blown off

15:04.294 --> 15:05.774
your MIT scholarship
for a badge,

15:05.817 --> 15:07.080
that could've been you.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.690
Think I made
the right choice.

15:08.733 --> 15:12.172
You sure? Those scooters go
at least eight miles an hour.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.305
Dani Westham, Chief of Security.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.481
We've done a full sweep of the
buildings, Sergeant. All clear.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.396
Well, your CEO's gonna
need police protection

15:19.440 --> 15:20.397
until we find this guy.

15:20.441 --> 15:21.790
Martin just left
for a conference

15:21.833 --> 15:23.966
in Tokyo.
He's gone until Monday.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.489
Charlie Moss may not know that.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.709
He can't get past our security.
We have the latest

15:27.752 --> 15:31.452
in facial recognition software,
triple-steel reinforced doors,

15:31.495 --> 15:33.454
and biometric
fingerprint access.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.890
We're more secure
than the White House.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.980
That's good to hear. We're
gonna run the check anyway.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.417
Okay. Right this way.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.419
NIA: Thanks so much
for meeting us here.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.595
SASHA: Everything's in
the statement I already gave,

15:44.639 --> 15:47.424
which went exactly nowhere.

15:47.468 --> 15:50.514
I understand your
frustration, Sasha,

15:50.558 --> 15:53.300
but the man who assaulted you
is still out there,

15:53.343 --> 15:54.518
attacking other women.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.781
HONDO: He went after
my sister last night.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.566
If it's the same guy,
we want to stop him.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.438
Even if you catch him,
he's not going to jail.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.744
I know how it works.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.920
Women aren't believed.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.533
Victims get shamed in court
or called sluts and liars.

16:09.577 --> 16:12.362
Rapists walk.
That's the real truth.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.975
You know what I'm talking about.

16:16.018 --> 16:20.457
I hate it, too,
but we can't just give up.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.591
Is there anything
that you do remember?

16:23.634 --> 16:25.419
Just what the doctors told me.

16:25.462 --> 16:28.248
That's the worst part, is...

16:28.291 --> 16:30.859
not even remembering
what he did to me.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.036
I'm sorry.No, don't apologize.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.559
None of this is on you.

16:35.603 --> 16:36.996
I just want to move on
with my life.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.562
I shouldn't
have come here.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.390
Please don't
call me again.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.566
There's nothing else
I can tell you.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.569
Look, I know you want
to forget it all happened,

16:45.613 --> 16:48.137
but it doesn't always
work like that.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.791
I hope you're talking to someone

16:49.834 --> 16:52.011
who can help you
get through this.

16:53.882 --> 16:54.883
HONDO:
Sasha.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.450
If you do remember
anything at all,

16:56.493 --> 16:59.888
would you please
contact me?

17:04.980 --> 17:07.069
I do remember something.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.071
It probably
won't matter, but...

17:09.115 --> 17:11.508
his smell.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.075
I couldn't wash it off.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.337
Can you describe it?

17:14.381 --> 17:17.297
Like rotten eggs.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.084
[door closes]

17:24.782 --> 17:26.306
Grass is always
greener.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.916
You secretly wishing
you were one of them

17:27.959 --> 17:29.700
instead of one of us?What? No.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.007
I'm talking about relationships,
about Bonnie.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.791
You guys hit a rough patch?

17:33.835 --> 17:35.880
No, everything's great. She
just started dropping all these

17:35.924 --> 17:38.013
not-so-subtle hints
about getting married.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.754
Like what?

17:39.797 --> 17:41.016
Wait a second.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.019
The female hostage
at the pharmacy,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.629
wasn't she wearing
a shirt just like that?

17:45.673 --> 17:46.891
Yeah.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.285
Female, around 30.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.766
If she works here,
she's on the wall.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.289
You said she's a witness
to something?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.900
Yeah, a possible witness.Deac, what do you think?

17:55.944 --> 17:58.251
Well, it looks like her, but
that's not the name she gave us.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.687
Is "Deborah" working today?

17:59.730 --> 18:01.254
No, she's new, part-time.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.821
Do you have her contact info?Sure. Let me get it for you.

18:03.865 --> 18:06.085
There's no way that
the hostage from the pharmacy

18:06.128 --> 18:07.651
just happens to work
at the same company

18:07.695 --> 18:09.044
that Charlie's going after.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.306
They had to have
been there together.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.003
We just didn't know it.We find Deborah,

18:12.047 --> 18:13.831
we should find Charlie.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.486
Should be good.Thanks, my man.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.706
Yeah.

18:18.749 --> 18:21.926
Hey, you gonna
play some ball?

18:21.970 --> 18:24.320
You live around here?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.107
Is this your mom?

18:30.979 --> 18:32.894
Is it true you're police?STREET: Yeah,
we're LAPD SWAT.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.549
We do all the cool stuff.
What's your name?

18:35.592 --> 18:37.464
Timo.
I'm Jim,

18:37.507 --> 18:39.509
but everybody calls me Street.I'm Luca.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.511
Why you move here?[chuckles]

18:41.555 --> 18:42.947
I've been getting that all day.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.340
VERA:
Timo!

18:45.602 --> 18:47.126
Hey, you want to shoot
some baskets later?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.606
My mom don't let me play there.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.261
MAN:
Where is it?

18:52.305 --> 18:54.350
Huh?Ain't a court anyway.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.529
Yeah.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.183
DEACON: Deborah Freeman
moved into a house

19:01.227 --> 19:02.750
off Topanga six weeks ago.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.100
TAN: Good place for Charlie
and Deborah to hide out.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.025
LAPD!

19:17.068 --> 19:18.679
Don't move!Or what, you'll shoot?

19:18.722 --> 19:19.897
This is ricin.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.030
I drop this,
it goes airborne,

19:22.073 --> 19:23.031
we're all dead.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.076
Okay, let's talk this out.Back up!

19:25.120 --> 19:27.035
Okay, we're not after you.
We're looking for Charlie.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.993
Back up. Tell them to back off.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.430
Back off, back off.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.041
Okay.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.782
They're going.

19:34.825 --> 19:38.133
How do you see this working out
for you, Deborah?

19:38.177 --> 19:41.223
Are you sure you want
to do this?

19:51.407 --> 19:52.843
How you feeling now?

19:52.887 --> 19:55.411
Like I've been
run over by a semi.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.587
Still can't believe
this happened.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.589
Brie, I talked to another
woman who was attacked.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.201
It might be the same guy.

20:02.244 --> 20:07.031
She said all she can remember
is the smell of rotten eggs.

20:07.075 --> 20:09.817
Did you notice
anything like that?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.253
No idea what
it could be?

20:11.297 --> 20:14.517
I mean, when I was
in art school,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.127
I took this, uh,
sculpting class.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.912
Sometimes we used
epoxy resin.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.001
The cheap stuff
smelled a lot like that.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.789
The club was in
the Art District.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.269
You think he might be
a sculptor?

20:27.313 --> 20:31.055
You know what, now I remember,

20:31.099 --> 20:33.797
he had all these weird scars
on his hand.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.582
Those could've been
chemical burns.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.627
From the resin.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.241
[beeps]

20:42.284 --> 20:44.634
Rubina, did you get anything
from that info I sent over?

20:44.678 --> 20:46.114
I sure did.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.942
Based on the locations
of the clubs and bars he's hit,

20:47.985 --> 20:51.250
the suspect probably lives
or works in this quadrant.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.252
I cross-referenced against
a couple of art websites

20:53.295 --> 20:55.210
and online galleries. No Liams.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
But I did find two Williams.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.302
William Marsh makes
custom sculptures of pets,

21:00.346 --> 21:01.477
and William Tanner makes--

21:01.521 --> 21:03.827
I'm not even sure
what you'd call it.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.264
Found him on a chat site
bitching about a general lack

21:05.307 --> 21:06.613
of appreciation for his talent.

21:06.656 --> 21:08.267
Rubina, I owe you.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.659
Send me both of those, will you?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.879
You got it.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.318
You find something?
Yeah.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.146
Deborah's phone.
They're definitely a couple.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.495
You get anything from her?She won't talk.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.323
Well, he's changed his MO.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.673
He knows he can't get up close
with all the security.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.458
Well, he's counting on his
girlfriend to get around that.

21:25.501 --> 21:28.199
CDC cleared the property.
Found evidence they cooked up

21:28.243 --> 21:29.853
twice what we grabbed.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.725
There's still ricin out there.

21:31.768 --> 21:32.682
Probably with Charlie.So if Deborah

21:32.726 --> 21:34.162
got a job at the cafeteria,

21:34.205 --> 21:36.164
what if the plan all along
was to put it in the food?

21:36.207 --> 21:37.339
He's not just going
after the boss,

21:37.383 --> 21:39.167
he's targeting
the whole company this time.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.957
That's him.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.785
You sure?
That is him.

21:50.047 --> 21:51.745
Can you arrest him?

21:51.788 --> 21:54.225
Brie, all we have right now is
a driver's license photo.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.271
Without any physical
evidence against him,

21:56.315 --> 21:57.359
a judge won't
issue a warrant.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.665
So that's it?

21:58.708 --> 22:00.231
He just gets away with it

22:00.275 --> 22:02.190
so he can do that
to more women?

22:02.233 --> 22:04.279
[scoffs]

22:14.942 --> 22:17.423
[indistinct chatter]

22:25.605 --> 22:27.824
Hey, let me know if you
need anything, okay?

22:27.868 --> 22:29.130
Yeah, sure.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.622
Browsing or shopping,
my man?

22:42.665 --> 22:44.406
Neither.

22:46.103 --> 22:48.454
LAPD.

22:51.718 --> 22:54.895
Where were you last night,
Mr. Tanner?

22:54.938 --> 22:57.114
I was here working late.

22:57.158 --> 22:59.421
Yeah?
What's that ink on your hand?

22:59.465 --> 23:00.988
That stamp doesn't prove that

23:01.031 --> 23:02.511
you were at the Astral Club
last night?

23:02.555 --> 23:04.383
Well, I took a break,
went out for a quick drink.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.341
Then I came back here,
worked late.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.344
You know, a woman got roofied
at that club last night,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.738
and she ID'd you as the man
who drugged her.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.392
Look, I don't know
a lot about roofies,

23:13.435 --> 23:14.828
but doesn't it affect
your memory?

23:14.871 --> 23:16.525
Because if she's saying
that I slipped her something,

23:16.569 --> 23:19.354
she's lying.

23:21.661 --> 23:23.750
You calling my sister a liar?

23:23.793 --> 23:26.448
Your sister?
That's right.

23:26.492 --> 23:29.364
Man, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.976
I never met your sister.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.370
Wait.
[snaps fingers]

23:35.414 --> 23:38.417
There was a black lady.
That was your sister?

23:38.460 --> 23:39.983
She tried to pick meup.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.420
She was so wasted
that she could barely

23:41.463 --> 23:42.421
stay on her feet.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.857
That's-that's not really
my thing.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.989
She had enough Rohypnol
in her system to take out six

23:46.033 --> 23:47.382
grown-ass men.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.471
Would you consent to me
searching the premises

23:49.515 --> 23:50.472
to make sure
you ain't got nothing

23:50.516 --> 23:53.475
lying around here like that?

23:53.519 --> 23:55.477
Uh, you know, I don't think so.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.913
What's the problem
if you're innocent?

23:56.957 --> 23:59.612
Look, I don't like how
you're trying to intimidate me.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.614
I didn't have anything to do
with what happened

24:01.657 --> 24:03.137
to your sister;
I hope she's okay, though.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.356
Oh, yeah, she's fine
because she got away.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.402
Unlike the other women
that you drugged and raped.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.492
[laughs]
You got the wrong guy.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.494
Look, no offense,
but what little

24:12.538 --> 24:13.539
that I remember
about your sister,

24:13.582 --> 24:17.368
she's, uh, not really my type.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.196
Did you try the club?
They got cameras, don't they?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.459
Oh, that's smooth.
You know they don't.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.982
Oh. So, let me
get this straight.

24:22.025 --> 24:24.288
You come into my place
with some personal beef

24:24.332 --> 24:26.160
on your own time,
you scare away my customers...

24:26.203 --> 24:27.378
Ain't nobody buying this trash.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.380
...and you accuse me
of being a rapist,

24:29.424 --> 24:30.469
with no evidence.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.340
Which you can't ever get

24:32.383 --> 24:34.560
because nothing happened.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.518
I don't have to talk to you.

24:36.562 --> 24:41.001
I'm asking you to respect
my rights and leave.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.790
All right.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.498
What are you doing?

25:04.677 --> 25:06.853
Well, I mean, if you're
telling the truth, your DNA

25:06.896 --> 25:09.899
is not gonna match up to any
rape kits in the system, so...

25:09.943 --> 25:11.292
no worries, right?

25:11.335 --> 25:13.990
Right.
Well, what does DNA prove?

25:14.034 --> 25:16.036
That I had sex
with some women?

25:16.079 --> 25:18.342
That doesn't mean
it wasn't consensual.

25:21.911 --> 25:24.131
Let me tell you something.

25:24.174 --> 25:26.350
if you ever drug or hurt
another woman,

25:26.394 --> 25:27.526
I will bypass this little
half-assed

25:27.569 --> 25:29.005
security system of yours,

25:29.049 --> 25:31.660
and I will wait right here,
inside, until you get home.

25:31.704 --> 25:34.271
You'll go reach
in the fridge for a beer,

25:34.315 --> 25:36.317
maybe you'll try to pull
your clothes out of the dryer,

25:36.360 --> 25:37.666
and when you turn around,

25:37.710 --> 25:40.277
this will be the last face
that you ever see.

25:40.321 --> 25:41.931
Do you understand me?

25:41.975 --> 25:45.108
You ain't the only one who can
get away with things, Liam.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.849
I could report you
for threatening me.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.548
Oh, please, please,
go ahead and make that call

25:49.591 --> 25:52.986
because I will wait.

25:53.029 --> 25:55.945
Let's let 'em look
into all of if.

25:57.033 --> 25:59.035
[phone buzzing]

26:05.433 --> 26:06.477
Yeah, what's going on, Captain?

26:08.741 --> 26:11.482
All right,
where do you need me?

26:11.526 --> 26:13.572
I'm on my way.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.455
Hey, what's up, guys?

26:27.498 --> 26:29.805
So, my buddy and I, we just, uh,

26:29.849 --> 26:32.591
we just moved in over there.Yeah, we ain't blind.

26:32.634 --> 26:33.722
You're Shorty, right?

26:33.766 --> 26:35.419
You're Marcos Guzman's
little brother.

26:35.463 --> 26:36.420
What's it to you?

26:36.464 --> 26:38.248
Why are you harassing us?

26:38.292 --> 26:40.294
No, we're not harassing you,
we just want to talk to you.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.078
STREET: Man to man.Yeah, look, it's all good

26:42.122 --> 26:43.471
that you guys hang out
here and everything,

26:43.514 --> 26:45.299
but this is a public
space for everybody

26:45.342 --> 26:46.605
in the neighborhood,
you know?

26:46.648 --> 26:48.041
Well, we ain't stopping nobody.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.086
[Spanish hip-hop music playing]

26:50.130 --> 26:51.697
â™ª

26:55.526 --> 26:56.919
Hey, Shorty,

26:56.963 --> 26:59.618
tell your brother I can get
that warrant off his head,

26:59.661 --> 27:00.880
but him and is crew
got to meet us here tonight

27:00.923 --> 27:02.142
for a little conversation.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.360
STREET:
Whatcha doing?

27:03.404 --> 27:04.927
Just making friends.
Starting at the top.

27:04.971 --> 27:06.625
[Chris whistles]

27:06.668 --> 27:08.931
Captain called.
There's a developing situation.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.716
She needs a few extra bodies.
Let's roll!

27:10.759 --> 27:13.501
MUMFORD: The suspect is
in possession of ricin.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.198
Evacuate the buildings.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.547
DANI: You said he was targeting
the cafeteria food.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.288
This stuff is lethal
if it gets airborne.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.333
Evacuate the entire campus.

27:19.376 --> 27:21.552
Do it.
Get everyone out.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.771
Move!

27:23.729 --> 27:26.862
Iris, Iris.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.516
Do you recognize this man?

27:28.559 --> 27:29.909
No. Who is he?

27:29.952 --> 27:30.953
It's-it's Deborah's boyfriend.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.215
That's not her boyfriend.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.869
She's dating Joe,
the facilities manager.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.784
That's how she got the job here.Wait a minute, wait a second,

27:35.828 --> 27:36.785
how much access does
he have to this campus?

27:36.829 --> 27:38.178
All of it.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.397
Okay. Go, go.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.233
So Deborah hooks up with Joe,
steals his codes or his pass,

27:50.277 --> 27:52.235
gives Charlie access
to the building.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.107
Joe's not answering.MUMFORD: Street, Tan,

27:54.150 --> 27:55.935
get everybody out of here now.
Everybody else with me.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.023
DANI:
Okay, it's this way.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.459
Hey, everybody. Let's go.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.243
Out! Come on, let's go.Okay, we gotta move. Move.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.245
[fire alarm wailing]Everybody out
this way, come on.

28:02.289 --> 28:04.770
[panicked chatter]

28:08.730 --> 28:10.166
Clear.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.696
Looks like Charlie beat us.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.306
Oh, God, that's Joe.DEACON: How'd he get
past security?

28:19.349 --> 28:21.482
I thought there was
facial-recognition software.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.571
The system recognizes
faces or fingerprints.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.615
Um, hey, hey.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.666
Can you locate him?Well, if he's using Joe's...

28:31.710 --> 28:33.755
Uh...

28:33.799 --> 28:35.931
Wait, it's not working.

28:35.975 --> 28:39.282
I'm locked out.Wait, there.

28:39.326 --> 28:40.980
Where's he going?What's on the third floor?

28:41.023 --> 28:42.416
Uh, the CEO's suite
and the boardroom.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.374
And access to the roof.MUMFORD: That's the AC.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.811
He's targeting
the central air system.

28:45.854 --> 28:46.942
Come on, let's move!

28:46.986 --> 28:48.248
That'll spread
the ricin everywhere.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.425
Let's go. Come on,
come on, guys, come on!

28:51.468 --> 28:52.426
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

28:52.469 --> 28:53.993
Hey, hold up, hold up.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.211
The system sealed
all the doors.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.386
MUMFORD: Break it down.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.648
DEACON: That's three layers
of steel.

28:57.692 --> 28:58.824
It's gonna need a charge.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.131
Gonna take more than one.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.785
He must have forced Joe to
undo everyone's permissions.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.221
I can't get online.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.788
What's that mean?He's in control
of the building.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.399
He's sealed all the doors
so no one can get out.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.401
Make a hole, make a hole.
back it up.Let me through! Let me through!

29:11.445 --> 29:12.707
Get it open.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.969
Let's go, get it open.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.275
Can you cut the AC?

29:15.318 --> 29:17.103
Chris, you set?Clear.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.234
Look out.
CHRIS:
Breach,

29:18.278 --> 29:20.280
three, two, one.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.413
Go, go, go.

29:23.457 --> 29:25.328
Rocker, cut the power
to all the buildings.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.634
Where's the circuit breaker?

29:26.677 --> 29:28.636
Electrical room, outside,
northwest corner.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.422
Back up! Back up!Back up, back up!

29:38.254 --> 29:39.952
It's not budging.Ah, it's bulletproof.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.355
Where's my team?

29:57.273 --> 29:58.709
STREET:
Hondo!

29:58.753 --> 30:00.755
Hondo, we can't get
the doors open.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.289
Luca, you're with me
on the two-three side.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.074
Chris, you're with me!On your ten!

30:15.117 --> 30:16.466
MUMFORD:
50-David to Command,

30:16.510 --> 30:18.164
we have ricin
in the central air system.

30:18.207 --> 30:21.080
You've got 60 seconds max
to clear the building.

30:21.123 --> 30:22.516
Get everybody back.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.170
Everybody down.
Get low, get low, get low.

30:24.213 --> 30:26.302
Everyone down,
turn around, take cover.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.000
Cover your eyes.
Cover your face.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.658
[explosion]

30:34.702 --> 30:36.878
I got to find the electrical
shut-off point.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.314
This way, this way.STREET:
All right, everyone, let's go.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.663
Come on, let's go!Come on, come on!

30:39.707 --> 30:41.056
Move! Move! Move!
come on.

30:49.412 --> 30:50.631
[grunts]

31:05.733 --> 31:07.474
Rocker.

31:14.481 --> 31:15.438
I'm out of charges. You?

31:15.482 --> 31:16.831
I'm out, too.Me, too.

31:25.405 --> 31:26.623
Uh...

31:26.667 --> 31:28.887
Show me your knife.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.932
DEACON:
30-David to Command,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.107
suspect's in the adjacent
building.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.587
50-David's in foot pursuit.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.545
He's in the atrium.
We're locked out.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.855
Move! Move! Come on, let's go!

32:03.269 --> 32:04.574
Hurry!

32:04.618 --> 32:06.925
Mumford has the suspect.
He's fighting

32:06.968 --> 32:08.013
on the fourth floor
at the two-three corner.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.928
We can't get to him.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.944
[grunts]

32:30.426 --> 32:31.993
Mumford!

32:34.039 --> 32:36.345
[shouts]Took you long enough.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.742
[excited chatter]

32:41.785 --> 32:43.657
It happened so fast.'Cause he's a beast.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.919
[laughter]

32:44.963 --> 32:47.704
Hondo. Thanks for coming
in on your day off.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.490
If I had known what
happened to your sister,

32:50.533 --> 32:52.013
I wouldn't have called you in.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.928
I'm happy to be here.

32:56.148 --> 32:58.541
Hey, what happened
to your sister?

32:58.585 --> 33:01.936
She's fine now.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.982
[laughter]

33:06.114 --> 33:09.291
Congratulations.
I heard the fight got nasty.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.727
Go see the medic.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.033
Get yourself checked out.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.687
Ah, the EMTs fixed me up.
I'm good.

33:13.730 --> 33:16.951
The FBI swept
Charlie's computer.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.866
He and Deborah have been
planning this for months.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.999
When you made him
at the drugstore,

33:21.042 --> 33:22.217
they figured it was
now or never.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.045
DEACON: If Mumford
hadn't recognized him?

33:24.089 --> 33:25.873
The body count?We stopped him.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.701
Hell of a day out there.

33:27.744 --> 33:28.658
End of shift.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.138
Go enjoy.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.879
All right, party at mine!

33:31.922 --> 33:33.707
We're gonna fire up the grills,
ice some beers.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.970
Who's coming?You might want to say no.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.016
It's still your anniversary.
Unless you want to
end up on the couch.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.974
No joke, that.
Sorry man, I can't.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.584
Yeah, I got a security gig.
I'm out.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.151
When do you find time to sleep?With a new baby on the way?

33:43.195 --> 33:45.066
Might as well get used to it.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.894
Mumford, how about you?

33:46.937 --> 33:49.114
I can't. Nikki's waiting
for me at home.

33:49.157 --> 33:51.377
Ah, you two lovebirds. The
honeymoon still ain't over?

33:51.420 --> 33:53.901
Never.
[laughs]
Good man.

33:53.944 --> 33:56.599
All right, just us, then.
Three makes it a party, right?

33:56.643 --> 33:58.253
[chuckles] Yeah.
Hell, yeah.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.951
So Bonnie wants to
seal the deal, huh?

34:00.995 --> 34:03.476
Seems like.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.087
Are there bridal magazines
popping up in unexpected places?

34:06.131 --> 34:07.915
That's how Annie let me know.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.047
No, she wants me
to meet her parents.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.961
That's a major move.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.138
Or she just wants you
to meet her parents.

34:13.181 --> 34:15.096
How do you ever know

34:15.140 --> 34:17.098
who you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

34:17.142 --> 34:20.580
I have no clue who I'll be five
years from now, let alone 50.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.278
Well, you hope you get
50 years together.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.019
That's terrifying.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.243
You don't want to marry
the wrong one,

34:31.286 --> 34:33.027
but you don't want
to be so scared

34:33.071 --> 34:34.637
that you don't marry
the right one, either.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.988
I mean, look at Hondo
and Luca. God love 'em,

34:38.032 --> 34:39.947
but I bet they weren't
planning on dying single.

34:39.990 --> 34:43.168
I hear you.

34:43.211 --> 34:46.127
Hey, hey. You did pretty good
in the major leagues.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.825
Little more practice,
you might get drafted.

34:59.009 --> 35:01.011
[exhales]

35:30.606 --> 35:33.131
So what happened?

35:36.177 --> 35:38.179
I had a talk with the guy.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.529
And?

35:40.573 --> 35:42.096
I got his DNA.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.098
But you know
it'll take months to process.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.056
And even if there's a hit,
he's already claiming consent.

35:47.493 --> 35:50.191
And no proof,
just like you tried to tell me.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.019
Maybe you scared him
enough with the DNA

35:52.062 --> 35:54.064
that he won't do it again.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.422
I threatened to
kill him if he did.

36:03.465 --> 36:04.988
What?

36:05.032 --> 36:06.990
It felt righteous.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.470
It wasn't.

36:09.950 --> 36:12.170
Why are you even telling me?

36:12.213 --> 36:14.955
Because you asked.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.175
A cop threatening a civilian?

36:17.218 --> 36:19.002
I definitely did
not just hear that.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.221
He ain't a civilian,
he's a rapist.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.396
A suspected rapist.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.747
[sighs]
Hondo,

36:24.791 --> 36:27.924
I know you want to punish
this guy, and I get it.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.100
You don't think
I'm angry?

36:30.144 --> 36:32.799
That women everywhere
aren't angry right now?

36:32.842 --> 36:35.236
There's a part of me that wishes
you would've done more

36:35.280 --> 36:38.674
than just threaten him,
but that is a slippery slope.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.154
I know that.We both worked too hard

36:40.198 --> 36:41.634
to get where we are.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.637
And you know
we don't get second chances.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.379
You got to get
a handle on this

36:47.422 --> 36:50.120
before it takes you somewhere
that you can't come back from.

36:54.516 --> 36:57.911
[sighs]

36:57.954 --> 37:01.262
I just dragged myself
out of a messy marriage.

37:01.306 --> 37:04.222
This?

37:04.265 --> 37:06.354
This was supposed
to be easy, light.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.095
A fun time.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.621
Maybe I bring out
the worst in you.

37:12.665 --> 37:15.494
This is not about you.I know.

37:15.537 --> 37:19.193
It's just something you say
at a time like this.

37:19.237 --> 37:23.328
I'm not what you signed up for.

37:30.683 --> 37:33.425
We both knew this wasn't
gonna be long-term.

37:37.994 --> 37:42.521
I want to see you deal
with this, whatever this is...

37:44.653 --> 37:47.395
...but I'm not the one
to help you.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.531
Maybe we should...

37:52.574 --> 37:53.749
Take a break?

37:58.885 --> 38:01.540
Yeah.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.282
Nia.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.200
Take care of yourself.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.811
I mean that.

38:11.854 --> 38:13.900
You, too.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.647
[sighs]

38:21.690 --> 38:23.431
All right. Nice job
on the courts, man.

38:23.475 --> 38:25.390
Thanks for coming through
when I called an audible.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.174
SARZO: We can get working
on the house tomorrow.

38:27.217 --> 38:28.349
Gonna take some time.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.308
Roger that. I'm in it
for the long haul.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.180
Street and I, we can rough it
for a while, you know?

38:33.223 --> 38:34.964
This is nice.STREET: Thanks
for the help, man.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.531
Cheers, brother.Hey, um,

38:36.575 --> 38:38.446
so what did Chris do
for Uncle Sarzo

38:38.490 --> 38:40.361
that he owes her
this big favor?

38:40.405 --> 38:41.710
Make, like, a dozen
parking tickets disappear,

38:41.754 --> 38:43.321
or what?Yeah, right, man.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.627
She doesn't break the rules.
Not even for family.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.064
Uh, when I was 12,

38:48.108 --> 38:50.153
I caught a leukemia diagnosis.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.765
And, um,
Chris was a match.

38:52.808 --> 38:55.289
She donated bone marrow,
saved my life.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.769
Did you just tell him?

38:56.812 --> 38:58.771
And she hates people
knowing she's a hero.

38:58.814 --> 39:01.687
All I did was lie on a gurney.
It's not a big deal.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.863
Sure it is.So you wait all this time

39:03.906 --> 39:06.256
to call in this favor
and you use it on me and Luca?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.911
Don't flatter yourself.
I call it in all the time.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.000
[laughter]Yeah, like, every other day.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.002
Oh. Hey, Timo. You want to play?

39:13.046 --> 39:14.700
Can I play?

39:14.743 --> 39:17.877
Five minutes,
then straight home.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.357
Yeah! Okay, we got a game going!

39:19.400 --> 39:20.706
Let's go, Timo![laughter]

39:20.749 --> 39:23.970
Yeah! All right!

39:24.013 --> 39:25.232
Timo!In the bucket, yeah.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.276
Hey, you guys want to play, too?

39:26.320 --> 39:28.366
No?

39:28.409 --> 39:29.802
Okay, foul.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.499
Call the cops. Oh, wait.

39:31.543 --> 39:32.805
[laughs][hip-hop music playing]

39:32.848 --> 39:34.676
Get it in, get it in, get it in.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.330
Yeah!Yeah!

39:36.374 --> 39:38.288
What?
Timo!

39:38.332 --> 39:39.464
LUCA:
Give me a high-five.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.466
Here we go,
Chris.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.945
[basketball bouncing]

39:42.989 --> 39:44.904
[cheering]

39:44.947 --> 39:47.428
Hang on.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.912
Hear you want to talk.I figured

39:52.955 --> 39:54.043
we could set some ground rules.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.349
What you even doing here?

39:55.393 --> 39:57.743
Huh? No place left to gentrify?

39:57.786 --> 39:59.919
I mean, if he wanted
to gentrify the neighborhood,

39:59.962 --> 40:01.747
he would've turned it
into a dog park.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.445
LUCA: Look, we live here now,
so all we want to do after work

40:04.489 --> 40:06.839
is come home, hang out with
our buddies and play some ball.

40:06.882 --> 40:09.319
We're not looking to hassle
anybody on our off-time.

40:09.363 --> 40:11.452
You think you can
fix up the court,

40:11.496 --> 40:13.933
change a few light bulbs
and now we all good?

40:13.976 --> 40:16.457
Hmm? It don't work like that.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.503
Look, I'm just telling you
we're not looking for trouble.

40:18.546 --> 40:22.158
But we also can't ignore
what we see on the corner.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.333
You know what I mean?

40:23.377 --> 40:25.031
There's nothing to see.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.511
So we all understand
each other, then?

40:26.554 --> 40:29.209
Yeah, we understand.
You want us out of here.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.733
But you see, we were here first.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.083
This is our neighborhood.
You hear me?

40:34.127 --> 40:38.392
My family's been on this block
since 1969, and we roll deep.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.916
We belong here. You don't.

40:42.657 --> 40:45.443
You'll figure that out
soon enough.

40:45.486 --> 40:46.922
Let's roll.

40:52.145 --> 40:55.365
Well, that went well.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.411
[car doors close, engines start]

40:59.544 --> 41:01.502
[indistinct voice over P.A.]

41:07.813 --> 41:12.295
How you holding up?

41:12.339 --> 41:15.298
You okay?

41:15.342 --> 41:16.822
Sure.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.478
You found that guy?

41:20.521 --> 41:23.568
Yeah. I had a talk with him.

41:23.611 --> 41:26.571
And I don't think he's
gonna hurt anyone else.

41:26.614 --> 41:29.443
And you, for sure, don't
have to worry about him.

41:39.714 --> 41:43.283
Come on. Let's get you home.

41:48.462 --> 41:50.464
I love you, Brie.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.510
I know.
