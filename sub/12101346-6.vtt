WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:03.836
Where the fuck am I?

00:05.339 --> 00:06.632
Where are you taking us?

00:07.508 --> 00:08.926
Where are you taking us?

00:10.552 --> 00:11.553
Margot?

00:13.514 --> 00:15.641
Get the fuck off me.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.519
Margot?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.271
Margot, you there?

00:23.190 --> 00:24.608
Margot, can you hear me?

00:35.285 --> 00:36.620
What is this bullshit?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.164
You're Calaca, right?

00:39.873 --> 00:41.500
I'm Allie. You know me.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.919
Yeah, so you say.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.463
Where's Margot?

00:48.799 --> 00:49.842
Where's my wife?

02:44.790 --> 02:46.250
-Hey.
-Where were you?

02:46.333 --> 02:47.376
I was here.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.753
Oh, my God. You scared the shit out of me.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.713
I mean, I look away for two seconds and--

02:53.340 --> 02:55.342
You can't do that, Charlie.

02:56.927 --> 03:01.181
Sorry, I was just looking at these guys.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.141
Do you think we should buy one of these?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.310
And do what?

03:05.394 --> 03:06.436
I don't know, like...

03:08.105 --> 03:09.523
set them free or...

03:09.606 --> 03:11.358
They've been raised in captivity.

03:11.441 --> 03:15.070
They wouldn't know how to be free.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.615
They wouldn't know how to avoid predators.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.868
Well, we should still give one a chance.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.162
You are so stoned right now.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.915
Come on. Let's go.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.510
-Photo?
-Si.

03:40.762 --> 03:41.763
No.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.058
-Go like that.
-This?

03:45.142 --> 03:46.518
They're American?

03:46.602 --> 03:47.603
Yes.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.565
Yes.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.655
Yep.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.210
Things took an odd turn.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.129
Is it a narcomensaje maybe?

04:16.130 --> 04:17.341
No, I guess not.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.678
What about orange hats?
Do they mean anything to you?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.096
Should they?

04:23.639 --> 04:24.890
I don't know.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.058
Thing of it is,

04:26.141 --> 04:29.353
I followed Allie and Margot
to that market over there.

04:30.062 --> 04:33.941
And I was about to take care of business
when they were jumped by about 20 guys.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.818
All of 'em in these caps.
These orange ball caps.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.904
Well, isn't that the damnedest thing?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.906
It's a puzzler, for sure.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.660
Either way, you lost them, Bill.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.787
Very bad...

04:46.870 --> 04:48.872
Very. Bad.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.084
The contract stands.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.044
Find them.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.297
Today.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.550
Today.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.593
Aye-aye.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.595
Let's go.

05:18.694 --> 05:19.820
Come on.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.371
Sooner we get this going,
sooner we can get me home

05:29.454 --> 05:32.082
to watch America's Got Talent.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.918
-That still on?
-Fuck you.

05:45.637 --> 05:46.680
Hey, boss.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.767
Yeah, we're pretty close.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.857
Well, Estelle laid out some bread crumbs
for the daughter, Dina.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.485
Oh, yeah.
We're feeling really good about that.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.992
Are you feeling good about that?
'Cause I'm not.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.086
So...

06:20.422 --> 06:22.132
I wonder, do you believe in witches?

06:23.550 --> 06:24.551
No.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.888
There's this guy called Friedrich Spee.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.890
He didn't believe in witches either.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.310
He witnessed the Inquisition,
going about his business.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.604
Saw a lot of innocent women tortured.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.732
Saw a lot of innocent women
denouncing other innocent women

06:38.815 --> 06:40.609
just to make the torture stop.

06:42.361 --> 06:46.448
We've known for 400 years
that torture doesn't work.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.160
So why does it still happen, do you think?

06:51.286 --> 06:54.665
See, apparently--
I read this in the bathroom.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.293
At any given moment,

06:58.752 --> 07:02.881
some form of torture is happening
in half the countries in the world.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.552
I mean, that's 44% of all refugees
to the United States.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.637
I've experienced it.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.099
And it's not like the US is Ajax clean.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.101
I mean, obviously, after 9/11,

07:14.184 --> 07:17.771
they rebranded it as
"enhanced interrogation,"

07:17.855 --> 07:21.608
but we all knew it was the same
classic recipe just in a different can.

07:21.692 --> 07:24.862
Fuck. Fifty-eight percent
of Americans approved.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.115
"Just do it." Am I right?

07:31.743 --> 07:34.580
Maybe that's why we're
the happiest place on Earth.

07:34.663 --> 07:35.873
Exactly.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.425
I'll get us a cup of tea.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.268
Fuck. Fuck!

07:59.104 --> 08:00.814
Where is this little snot?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.028
Come back, Dina.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.323
Your country needs you.

08:10.657 --> 08:15.787
And the cartel's waiting
to cut you up into itty-bitty pieces.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.081
Oh, come on, Estelle. That's not funny.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.058
What?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.102
Nothing.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.397
-Do I have something in my teeth or--
-No, your teeth are fine.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.816
Then what?

08:47.069 --> 08:50.197
How much do you remember
about being little?

08:51.490 --> 08:52.783
How little?

08:52.866 --> 08:56.954
Like little, little.
Do you remember the old house?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.038
Which one?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.916
The first one. The one with the TV.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.005
No. Why?

09:07.089 --> 09:08.966
No reason. It's just-- I don't know.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.592
I was just trying to think back,

09:10.676 --> 09:13.679
see if I could remember Mom
being pregnant with you, and I couldn't.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.014
Does that seem weird?

09:16.849 --> 09:18.892
I don't know. You were pretty small.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.604
Yeah, but it seems bizarre, right?

09:22.688 --> 09:25.691
I mean,
I do remember Dad giving you to me.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.529
Wait. What? Dad--

09:31.363 --> 09:34.616
Dad doing what? Giving you--

09:34.700 --> 09:35.826
Yes.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.454
And he says, "Hold on a second.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.126
You only get a brother
if you promise to be nice to him

09:44.209 --> 09:46.587
and take care of him,

09:47.296 --> 09:48.714
and play with him.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.924
It's a pretty big responsibility."

09:51.008 --> 09:53.886
And I'm just like, "Gimme, gimme, gimme."

09:53.969 --> 09:57.222
But, I mean, I don't-- I mean, come on.

09:57.306 --> 10:01.560
I don't remember
Mom being pregnant or anything.

10:02.853 --> 10:03.979
Is that weird?

10:04.062 --> 10:06.732
It's just kinda weird
that you keep asking about it.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.790
Listen, order some ice cream or something.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.000
I'm gonna...

10:25.709 --> 10:28.462
-I need to use the restroom. Okay?
-Okay.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.087
Helpline number.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.634
Fox Family Helpline.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.178
Hello?

11:18.262 --> 11:21.306
Dina? Dina Fox, is that you?

11:22.057 --> 11:23.183
Uh-huh.

11:23.267 --> 11:27.062
Well, thank goodness.
I was hoping you might call.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.357
This is Estelle Jones.
We spoke a little earlier.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.609
I was at your boyfriend's house, Josh.

11:33.694 --> 11:37.406
Listen,
I need you to stay on the phone, okay?

11:37.489 --> 11:39.700
Honey, please don't hang up on me again.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.662
So, I guess you've been
reading the newspapers, huh?

11:45.163 --> 11:47.082
I'm sorry you had to find out that way.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.668
-That's not how it should have been.
-Jesus, Estelle.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.752
Shut up.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.964
Listen.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.383
What Allie and Margot did was wrong.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.053
And it caused a lot of hurt.
A lot of hurt.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.347
But they did it for a good reason.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.560
They wanted to have a family.
They wanted children to love.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.812
And they do love you.

12:10.189 --> 12:13.901
But, honey, right now,
I need you to tell me where they are.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.403
Can you do that?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.655
Can you tell me
where I can find Allie and Margot?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.574
Just, wait.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.411
Charlie, is--

12:24.494 --> 12:25.996
-Is he actually--
-No.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.333
You listen to me, Dina. You listen to me.

12:30.167 --> 12:34.588
That boy is your brother
in every way that matters.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.882
Just not biologically.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.931
Lost her.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.018
She'll call back.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.156
-Seriously, what is your problem?
-She's just a kid.

13:01.240 --> 13:05.244
Please. I just made that little brat's
dreams come true.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.496
Look, I'm not gonna argue about it.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.208
I think it's a shitty thing to tell
a kid that age. Shitty, that's all.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.418
You tell me a better way to do
what we came here to do

13:13.502 --> 13:14.920
without anybody getting hurt.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.421
She's getting hurt. The kid is.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.674
I'm not talking about the kid's feelings.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.343
I'm talking about people
getting bullet-hurt.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.471
-Well, I don't like it.
-Well, I don't care.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.108
Finally. What took so long?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.819
Oh, shit. You've been crying?

13:38.902 --> 13:41.488
What? No. Jesus.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.323
You freak, though.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.869
Don't call me a freak, you freak.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.454
Kids, here's your bill.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.672
So, let's start again.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.677
Now, there was a guy...

14:47.554 --> 14:49.723
called Alec Finn.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.728
Environmental activist.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.189
At least that's what
he told people he was called.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.609
So how does this same Alec Finn

15:00.692 --> 15:05.697
later turn up working
with the National Security Agency?

15:08.784 --> 15:10.410
-"For."
-Hey?

15:10.494 --> 15:12.788
Not, "with." You said "with." "For."

15:12.871 --> 15:15.249
-Is there a difference?
-Yes, there's a big difference.

15:15.332 --> 15:18.085
Oh, well, then run it by me then,
this "difference."

15:18.752 --> 15:20.254
While ago I had a start-up.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.925
One-man operation. Ran it out
of the back of my house, matter of fact.

15:25.008 --> 15:28.095
And I let it get acquired
by some Silicon Valley assholes

15:28.178 --> 15:30.347
that showed up with a lot of promises.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.807
Which you believed?

15:31.890 --> 15:35.310
What, you?
Mr. Anti-corporate here? Mr. No-logo.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.563
What, you stop being a pirate?
Join the Navy.

15:37.646 --> 15:40.566
Nobody said I wasn't stupid. Huh?

15:41.608 --> 15:47.364
But, I re--
I actually believed in this thing.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.410
I actually thought
I could do some good in the world.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.705
-So what was it?
-An algorithm.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.081
That did what?

15:56.164 --> 16:01.295
Used climate-change projections to track
changes in bird migration patterns.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.589
Why the fuck would the government
be interested in bird migration?

16:03.672 --> 16:06.383
I don't know. Next thing I know,
they whore me out to the NSA,

16:06.466 --> 16:07.759
make me an offer I can't refuse.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.094
So what did you do?

16:10.179 --> 16:11.889
I refused it.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.101
'Cause that's my idea,
and they can't have it.

16:16.185 --> 16:18.520
I'm the one that gets
to say what it's used for.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.147
So, where is it now?

16:20.230 --> 16:22.941
It's in my head.
I wiped it off the face of the Earth.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.486
Fuck 'em.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.906
And then suddenly--

16:30.782 --> 16:33.869
Here you are,
ten years later, on the run in Mexico.

16:34.494 --> 16:39.583
Sending out distress signals to all your
old comrades who you turned your back on.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.254
Seeking refuge in Casa Roja.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.758
-That's right.
-Excellent.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.261
Well, so tell me about it, Casa Roja.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.559
See, I was kinda hoping that you
were gonna now tell me about Casa Roja.

16:57.643 --> 17:01.855
That's right, yes. 'Cause I am Calaca,
gatekeeper to Casa Roja.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.774
-That's right.
-Oh, goodness gracious me. No.

17:03.857 --> 17:07.486
No, no, there's no Calaca. Not anymore.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.321
And what happened to him?

17:11.365 --> 17:15.202
Well, the most recent one,
they died. She died.

17:16.787 --> 17:17.788
Of what?

17:19.498 --> 17:20.790
Of her injuries.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.410
So, does it ever bother you?

17:57.327 --> 17:58.328
What?

17:59.621 --> 18:00.622
All of it.

18:02.207 --> 18:05.878
Growing up without friends or whatever?

18:07.296 --> 18:09.256
I don't know. I mean...

18:10.299 --> 18:12.634
most kids are into
some pretty boring stuff, so...

18:13.385 --> 18:14.803
I never really think about it.

18:15.554 --> 18:18.849
So you never think about
how things might have been

18:20.017 --> 18:21.685
if Mom and Dad were different?

18:23.979 --> 18:24.980
Different how?

18:27.357 --> 18:28.358
Normal.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.029
No. I think it's cool, you know?

18:32.821 --> 18:35.532
We get to do some fun stuff,
so it's like--

18:36.408 --> 18:38.535
It basically balances out, you know?

18:51.632 --> 18:53.133
We should be heading back.

18:53.634 --> 18:54.760
Why?

18:56.053 --> 18:57.763
In case Mom and Dad get pissed.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.023
Hey! Time to go.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.010
See, Calaca44 was--

19:37.094 --> 19:41.765
was just a handle used by Casa Roja's,
well, border guard, I suppose.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.103
We've been sitting on the handle for--
oof, quite a while now.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.564
Hoping that someone like you
might turn up.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.440
You know, make contact.

19:51.483 --> 19:52.484
Maybe help us out.

19:52.568 --> 19:56.321
Who's "us"? What are you MI6? FSB?

19:56.405 --> 19:58.323
Let's not dwell on that.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.742
Let's talk about Casa Roja.

20:01.952 --> 20:03.787
Go on, what can you tell me about it?

20:04.788 --> 20:06.206
I got nothing.

20:06.290 --> 20:11.837
Okay, well, what we understand
is that it's a kind of terrorist enclave.

20:11.920 --> 20:17.176
A safe house for self-proclaimed
dissidents and violent radicals.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.636
So wha-- Here's my question, right?

20:19.720 --> 20:23.473
What kind of bad hombre are you, Allie,

20:23.557 --> 20:26.602
that you go looking for sanctuary
in a place like that?

20:27.519 --> 20:28.770
Eh?

20:30.522 --> 20:31.690
All right.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.443
Let's see if this
will loosen your tongue up a bit.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.118
Where is she?

21:11.813 --> 21:13.524
-Yeah?
-Go ahead.

21:39.258 --> 21:41.635
Say something, you fucking coward!

21:41.718 --> 21:43.929
Fun is over. Stop this.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.347
Stop it.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.017
When I tell you.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.730
-Leave her alone.
-All right.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.483
Then tell me everything you know
about Casa Roja.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.318
I don't know what to say!

21:58.402 --> 22:02.739
Listen. I really need you
to tell me the truth here, Allie.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.825
I can't tell you something
that I don't know.

22:04.908 --> 22:07.828
Right. Well, then let's be clear.
It's not me, it's you killing this woman.

22:07.911 --> 22:11.290
-What do you want me to say? I--
-Tell me how to find Casa Roja.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.333
I don't know anything about it.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.752
-Do you want me to make something up?
-Well.

22:15.836 --> 22:16.837
Do you want me to lie?

22:19.840 --> 22:20.883
Ten.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.551
Fine. I can lie.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.136
-Nine.
-The way to get there?

22:24.219 --> 22:25.804
You just take a right at the second star,

22:25.888 --> 22:27.389
-follow the yellow brick road.
-Eight.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.473
They got lemonade springs,

22:28.557 --> 22:30.559
-they got songbirds singing.
-Seven.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.853
-Amelia Earhart's down there--
-Oh, fuck you, Allie. Five.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.771
Married to D.B. Cooper.
They got nine children.

22:34.855 --> 22:36.565
-Four.
-What do you want me to say?

22:36.648 --> 22:37.774
-Three.
-Come on, Allie.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.484
-I don't know!
-Two.

22:39.568 --> 22:42.404
Wanna throw me in the water,
see if I float, and burn me if I don't?

22:42.487 --> 22:44.281
One. Last chance, Allie. Last chance.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.657
Allie, goddamn it!

22:46.200 --> 22:47.326
Allie!

22:47.409 --> 22:49.870
Margot, shut your eyes. Shut them tight!

22:49.953 --> 22:52.289
-Tell me, you prick. Tell me now.
-I'm sorry, honey.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.290
I love you, Margot!

22:53.373 --> 22:55.375
-Go ahead.
-Allie, goddamn it!

22:55.918 --> 22:57.544
Margot, I'm sorry, honey!

23:33.956 --> 23:36.416
Isela told me we could trust you.

23:38.001 --> 23:41.171
I gotta tell you,
I flat out did not agree.

23:42.005 --> 23:45.175
I had you marked down as government,
sure as eggs is eggs.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.475
But hey, you were right the first time.

23:53.559 --> 23:55.811
I am Calaca.

23:55.894 --> 23:58.146
Your ticket to Casa Roja.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.778
So let's dial down the outrage
a notch, shall we?

24:22.671 --> 24:23.797
Hey.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.091
I'll meet you inside.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.209
Hello?

25:01.335 --> 25:02.336
Dina?

25:06.465 --> 25:07.466
So what do I do?

25:15.766 --> 25:18.393
Hey, hey! It's not who you are.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.272
And you?

25:24.525 --> 25:25.651
I'm who they made me.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.654
Come on, look at me.

25:29.613 --> 25:31.907
I used to be an environmental lawyer
for Christ's sake.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.119
Lived in Westwood. I owned a Tesla.

25:37.329 --> 25:39.373
And a Peloton, which I never used.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.711
We got a good place, Allie.
We just wanna protect it.

25:46.839 --> 25:47.965
Then build a wall.

25:50.175 --> 25:51.260
I am the wall.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.641
My people are following the kids.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.142
They're having quite the day out.

25:59.226 --> 26:01.478
But they'll lead us back
to their mom and dad,

26:01.562 --> 26:03.522
as sure as a pig is bacon.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.537
Margot!

26:25.627 --> 26:26.670
Margot!

26:31.508 --> 26:32.509
Honey!

26:38.223 --> 26:39.433
Margot!

26:50.235 --> 26:51.236
Margot!

27:08.545 --> 27:09.755
We did it.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.091
We're in.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.722
Just over the border. South.

27:19.765 --> 27:20.933
Guatemala.

27:22.601 --> 27:23.769
It's Guatemala.

27:38.575 --> 27:40.035
It's gonna be an adventure.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.132
Where you going?

27:55.175 --> 27:56.593
It's just us. They left.

28:07.187 --> 28:09.106
You fucking prick.

28:10.816 --> 28:12.943
Honey, come on.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.446
I was playing them.

28:18.699 --> 28:21.451
I knew it was bullshit.
It's like bizarro border control.

28:21.535 --> 28:23.036
I could see that from the moon.

28:24.538 --> 28:25.914
And you didn't stop to think

28:25.998 --> 28:28.959
that maybe my brains might have
ended up across the floor?

28:29.042 --> 28:29.877
No.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.920
-Not for one second?
-No.

28:32.004 --> 28:33.005
I mean...

28:34.548 --> 28:36.884
Yes, of course for one second.

28:37.843 --> 28:39.678
But I knew they were never gonna hurt you.

28:43.891 --> 28:46.476
You didn't seem so certain
from where I was sitting.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.812
Of course not, because I had to sell it.

28:50.063 --> 28:53.859
They had to know that they could trust me.
Us, they had to trust us.

28:56.195 --> 28:57.404
It worked, right?

28:58.697 --> 28:59.698
Hey.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.201
Guatemala.

29:04.244 --> 29:05.454
Guatemala.

29:06.455 --> 29:09.082
Better than Mexico. It's gonna be great.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.338
No.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.632
It's not gonna be great.

29:16.715 --> 29:18.300
Because it never is.

29:18.926 --> 29:21.845
You promise and promise,
but never deliver.

29:21.929 --> 29:24.973
And that's my fault. I let you do it.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.435
We both know why.

29:29.394 --> 29:34.191
But that's not happening anymore.
That's over.

29:46.954 --> 29:48.205
Margot. Come on.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.018
Could you spare some money?

30:52.519 --> 30:53.520
It's them.

30:57.900 --> 31:01.069
I say we wake the kids tonight.
We head south.

31:01.695 --> 31:04.364
Maybe we stop off at the ocean on the way,
you know?

31:06.825 --> 31:09.077
What? The kids have never seen the beach.

31:09.745 --> 31:11.788
Let's do something normal
for five minutes.

31:11.872 --> 31:14.833
Yeah, yeah. Take a breath.
Make some s'mores.

31:36.522 --> 31:37.523
What?

31:52.412 --> 31:55.707
We found them.
A place called the Hotel Isabel.

31:57.793 --> 32:02.256
Make sure no one leaves
until my boys get there.

32:02.339 --> 32:03.590
You got it.

32:12.683 --> 32:13.684
Let's skedaddle.

32:36.039 --> 32:37.040
Who are you?

32:37.124 --> 32:39.835
Allie and Margot,
we need you to come with us right now.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.171
Please.

32:47.801 --> 32:49.052
How did you find us?

32:58.604 --> 32:59.605
Charlie?

33:17.289 --> 33:19.708
It's okay. Help me understand here, honey.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.087
I don't understand.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.425
That's not true.

33:30.594 --> 33:33.889
Allie, none of this matters.
You and your family need to come with us.

33:33.972 --> 33:35.641
The cartel's coming after your ass.

33:41.855 --> 33:44.483
They're with some other Americans.

33:46.652 --> 33:47.653
Thank you.

33:58.455 --> 33:59.957
We're too late.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.792
America got here first.

34:02.501 --> 34:03.502
Bill.

34:04.670 --> 34:08.005
Have you heard of
the passer à la mandoline?

34:08.090 --> 34:09.632
I do not believe I have.

34:10.801 --> 34:15.054
It was an old French-Moroccan
torture technique.

34:15.722 --> 34:21.311
The steel string of a mandolin
was drawn up between the thighs,

34:21.895 --> 34:26.275
used to slice the testicles in half.

34:28.150 --> 34:29.319
Copy that.

34:30.571 --> 34:32.781
I want the man alive. The father.

34:32.864 --> 34:35.033
Kill the others if you have to.

34:53.677 --> 34:56.388
-You guys alone?
-At this particular moment in time, yep.

34:56.471 --> 34:57.472
Just us chickens.

34:57.556 --> 35:00.267
And the cartel, so if you don't mind
coming along with us, please.

35:00.350 --> 35:01.351
Dad?

35:01.435 --> 35:03.854
-It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
-It's really not.

35:03.937 --> 35:06.732
-You're scaring them.
-Good. We all need to be scared right now.

35:06.815 --> 35:08.483
-Then let us go.
-Not happening.

35:11.278 --> 35:12.529
You guys got no skin in this game.

35:12.613 --> 35:14.615
You're gonna get yourselves hurt just--
What? For us?

35:14.698 --> 35:17.826
You're gonna march six of us all the way
to the border with the cartel on us?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.328
We got two kids.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.246
They got legs half our size.

35:21.330 --> 35:23.332
They get soggy knees
walking to the grocery store.

35:23.415 --> 35:25.000
Do you think your--

35:25.083 --> 35:26.919
your boss is gonna give you
some commendation

35:27.002 --> 35:29.338
for getting us all cut to pieces? Come on.

35:29.421 --> 35:32.966
Just tell them that we were gone
when you got here.

35:33.467 --> 35:36.428
You couldn't find us. Go home.
Just stay safe.

35:36.512 --> 35:40.140
Jesus Christ, Dad.
Just shut up and let's go!

35:42.267 --> 35:44.770
-I'll get her.
-Uh-uh. Not you.

35:44.853 --> 35:45.979
Well, she's scared.

35:46.063 --> 35:48.357
We move as a group,
or we don't move at all.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.859
Go sit.

36:09.753 --> 36:10.796
Dina.

36:28.272 --> 36:31.608
Dina. Dina, you're not safe by yourself.

36:34.236 --> 36:35.445
Dina. Dina.

36:43.495 --> 36:44.788
Stay here.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.376
Lock yourself in the bathroom.

37:12.733 --> 37:15.235
Look what you fucking did!
Who are you to do this?

37:15.319 --> 37:16.403
Who the fuck are you?

37:17.196 --> 37:18.780
Come on.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.657
Stop it. Stop! Stop!

37:22.242 --> 37:24.661
Stop. What was the fucking point of that?

37:29.082 --> 37:30.876
-Allie!
-Who the fuck are you?

37:30.959 --> 37:32.836
-Get out of there! Move!
-He can't shoot me.

37:34.379 --> 37:35.380
He can't shoot.

37:37.925 --> 37:39.801
Let's go. Run.

37:46.475 --> 37:48.435
You can bet he's got more people coming.

37:59.446 --> 38:00.864
You guys, hurry up now.

38:01.490 --> 38:03.700
-Charlie, get down!
-The cops are coming.

38:04.493 --> 38:06.620
Son, it's the cops
we need to be scared of right now.

38:24.513 --> 38:26.557
What are we gonna do?

38:26.640 --> 38:28.725
Just get away from them.

38:34.231 --> 38:35.691
-Guys.
-Come on.

38:59.756 --> 39:02.259
-Oh, shit. Here.
-Give it to me.

39:03.218 --> 39:06.763
-Go. Go.
-Come on.

39:07.931 --> 39:08.932
Fuck!

39:11.059 --> 39:12.728
I did it. Dad.

39:19.985 --> 39:21.653
Mom, Dad. Come.

39:36.168 --> 39:38.212
Get out there and find them!

39:41.256 --> 39:43.300
-Wait, get back, get back!
-Shit.

39:47.596 --> 39:48.597
Go.

39:50.349 --> 39:51.350
Go.

40:06.323 --> 40:07.324
Go.

40:07.407 --> 40:08.492
Come on. Let's go.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.084
Hold on, guys. Here, here.

40:42.025 --> 40:43.610
Come on. Come on.
