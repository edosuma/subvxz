00:43.210 --> 00:44.662
Bigelow.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.006
- Well, what did I do now?
- Nothing.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.553
I, uh, just thought you'd want
to know. There's trouble.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.305
I thought you said
I didn't do nothing.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.350
Oh, no, not you. I, uh...

01:01.395 --> 01:03.813
I can't tell you where I heard it,

01:03.814 --> 01:07.692
but I heard things ain't going
so good for your kinfolk...

01:07.693 --> 01:09.395
Down on Earth.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.572
There's trouble?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.074
- Is it Julie?
- Well, I don't know exactly.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.827
- Well, is it my boy?
- I told you I don't know.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.121
Well, now, ain't that just dandy?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.498
Here you take the trouble to tell
me there's trouble down there,

01:22.499 --> 01:24.917
but you don't know what
kind of trouble it is.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.336
Do me a favor, will you?

01:27.337 --> 01:31.792
Go... Bother somebody else
while I finish these...

01:32.926 --> 01:35.428
- ...stars.
- All right.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.475
I just thought you might want
to go down there, maybe help.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.019
Who, me?

01:43.020 --> 01:45.393
You gone loony or something?

01:46.857 --> 01:48.316
How?

01:48.317 --> 01:51.694
Well, everybody's got a right
to go back for one day.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.613
- They have?
- Sure.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.865
That's the only reason I told you.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.194
Hey, come here. Come here. Hey.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.786
Not that I'm interested
in going back there,

02:00.787 --> 02:04.742
but, uh, just in case I
should be, who, uh...

02:05.125 --> 02:07.251
Who gives out this permission?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.375
The star keeper.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.131
Him, huh?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.545
Well, I'll think about it.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.201
Was you wanted to see me?

04:12.711 --> 04:15.334
Yes, I was.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.216
I heard my family's in
trouble down there.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.888
Somebody tried to tell me if I
came up here and see you, why...

04:23.889 --> 04:26.308
You'd give me permission
to go back for one day.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.684
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

04:28.685 --> 04:33.061
But as I recall, Bigelow, when you
first got here, you waived that right.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.567
- I did?
- Yep, pretty sure,

04:36.568 --> 04:38.987
but let's look at the record.

04:43.366 --> 04:47.244
Ah, here we are.
"Bigelow. Question,

04:47.245 --> 04:50.706
"'Is there anything on Earth you
left unfinished, Mr. Bigelow?

04:50.707 --> 04:54.960
"The reason I ask is you're entitled to go
back there for one day if you want to.'

04:54.961 --> 04:59.257
"Answer, 'As long as I'm here,
I might as well stay."'

05:01.009 --> 05:02.426
I said that?

05:02.427 --> 05:05.756
Why, you don't think
this book's incorrect, do you?

05:06.264 --> 05:07.681
No.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.685
Well, if that's the way it is,
that's the way it is.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.687
Wait a minute, now. Wait a minute.

05:13.688 --> 05:18.018
You know, sometimes we make
exceptions in special cases.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.232
Special cases?

05:20.737 --> 05:25.825
Oh, you mean, if a guy led a
good life, he'd deserve a break?

05:25.826 --> 05:28.869
- That kind of thing, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.206
- I know the answer already.
- Do you, now?

05:32.207 --> 05:35.581
Now, how do you know
how we judge things up here?

05:36.253 --> 05:40.506
Eh, it'd just be wasting
your time and mine.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.550
Simmer down now,
Billy. You're forgetting.

05:42.551 --> 05:46.301
Here there is no time. This
is the beginning and the end.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.764
Why don't you tell
me about yourself?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.967
What did you do down there?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.936
What did I do down there?

05:54.396 --> 05:56.897
Oh, you mean, "What did
I do for a living?"

05:56.898 --> 05:59.942
Well, you can start
there, if you want.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.486
Well, uh...

06:02.654 --> 06:05.482
- I owned this carousel.
- You what?

06:06.908 --> 06:10.619
Look. If you know this story, what
do you want to hear it again for?

06:10.620 --> 06:15.833
Oh, I don't know the story, but I can see
through you like a pane of window glass.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.287
Now, why don't you start over?

06:19.838 --> 06:23.668
Well, I worked for this lady
who owned the carousel.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.967
Ah.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.170
But I was the main attraction.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.017
I was, wasn't I?

06:33.768 --> 06:37.313
Every night, girls
would gather around,

06:37.314 --> 06:38.898
music would be playing,

06:38.899 --> 06:42.067
the carousel would be going
round and round,

06:42.068 --> 06:45.404
the whole midway would be
packed with people,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.858
and I'd be standing up there.

07:35.580 --> 07:40.376
All right, everybody. Hurry, hurry.
Come ride on the carousel.

07:40.377 --> 07:44.713
One more glorious spin.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

07:44.714 --> 07:48.043
Step right this way,
and come ride the...

07:49.552 --> 07:52.554
The ride starts in a few minutes,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.760
Just a very few minutes. Hurry,
hurry over this way and...

08:07.070 --> 08:10.319
Do you mind?

08:12.742 --> 08:15.411
Come on, everybody.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.745
Ride on the carousel,

08:16.746 --> 08:19.248
the most beautiful carousel
you've ever seen.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.793
And this year it's
faster and faster.

08:22.460 --> 08:28.338
The ride of a lifetime. Fifteen minutes
for five cents is all, five little cents.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.004
Get in line.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.811
Young lady, where's your ticket?

08:40.270 --> 08:43.313
- I don't have any.
- You can buy one.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.914
Up.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.566
Julie.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.917
Julie, come on. Hurry. Come on.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.547
She's coming after
us again. Let's run.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.796
No, I ain't scared of her.

09:54.636 --> 09:59.098
Listen, you little... I've got
one more thing to tell you.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.101
If you ever so much as poke
your nose in my carousel again,

10:02.102 --> 10:05.312
I'm gonna have you thrown out,
right on your little pink bustle.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.649
You've got no call to talk to her like
that. She ain't doing you no harm.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.652
Oh, ain't she? I suppose you think I
wanna get in trouble with the police

10:11.653 --> 10:14.571
- and maybe lose my license?
- What is the woman talking about?

10:14.572 --> 10:18.033
Letting my barker fool with you.
Ain't you ashamed?

10:18.034 --> 10:21.703
- I don't let no man fool...
- He leaned against her all through the ride.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.248
He leaned against the horse,
but he didn't lay a hand on me.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.791
Oh, no, Miss Innocence.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.794
And I suppose he didn't put his
arm around your waist neither.

10:28.795 --> 10:33.006
And suppose he did. Is that a reason
to go and have a "capuleptic" fit?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.217
You mind your own
business, you hussy.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.719
Go on back to your old
carousel and leave us alone.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.182
- Yeah, leave us alone, you old...
- I don't run my business for a lot of sluts.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.810
Who you calling a slut?
Slut yourself.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.059
- Yeah, slut yourself.
- Shut up!

10:47.188 --> 10:49.148
Jabber, jabber, jabber,
jabber, jabber.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.237
What's going on anyway?

10:55.238 --> 10:58.365
Spitting and sputtering like three
lumps of corn a-poppin' on a shovel.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.701
- Mr. Bigelow, please...
- Don't yell.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.122
- I didn't yell.
- Well, don't.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.373
What's the matter?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.584
I want you to take a good
look at that girl, Billy.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.253
She ain't never to be allowed
on my carousel again.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.964
Next time she tries to
get in, if she dares,

11:13.965 --> 11:15.591
I want you to throw her out,
you understand?

11:15.592 --> 11:18.135
- Throw her out!
- All right, all right.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.138
Well, you heard what the lady said.
Go on. Go on home.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.307
- Shoo, get.
- Come on, Julie.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.978
- No, I won't.
- Would you like a nice, cool drink, Billy?

11:27.979 --> 11:29.931
- Sure.
- Mr. Bigelow.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.943
Tell me, please, honest and truly.

11:34.944 --> 11:38.990
If I come back to the carousel
again, would you throw me out?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.452
What did she do anyway?

11:43.453 --> 11:46.205
She said you put your arm
around my waist.

11:46.206 --> 11:51.627
Aha, well. There's something new.

11:51.628 --> 11:55.589
Can't put my arm around a girl without first
asking permission, is that how it is?

11:55.590 --> 11:58.839
No, I just don't want
that one around no more.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.390
You come around all you like, see.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.269
You ain't got the price, Billy
Bigelow will treat you to a ride.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.649
Big talker, ain't you, Mr. Bigelow?

12:13.650 --> 12:17.319
I suppose you think I can't
throw you out too if I want to?

12:17.320 --> 12:18.820
You're such a good barker,

12:18.821 --> 12:22.115
I can't run my business
without you, is that it?

12:22.116 --> 12:25.327
Well, just for that,
you're discharged.

12:25.328 --> 12:29.328
Your services are no longer required.
You're bounced. See?

12:29.666 --> 12:32.000
Very well, Mrs. Mullin. Very well.

12:32.001 --> 12:36.880
Well, now, you know, I could
bounce you if I felt like it.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.550
Well, you felt like it just now.
So I'm bounced, bounced.

12:40.551 --> 12:44.346
Well, now, you don't have to pick up
every word I say. I only said that I...

12:44.347 --> 12:47.391
Said that my services
were no longer required.

12:47.392 --> 12:50.971
Very good, Mrs. Mullin.
We'll let it go at that.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.064
All right, you devil.
We'll let it go at that.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.650
- Mr. Bigelow, if she said she's...
- You keep out of this.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.570
But I don't want this
to happen on account of me.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.029
- Apologize to her.
- Aha!

13:04.575 --> 13:08.620
Me apologize to her? For what?
For giving my carousel a bad name?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.449
A ba...

13:12.750 --> 13:17.046
The day you bought the carousel,
Mrs. Mullin, it got a bad name.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.126
After all I've done for
you, that's what...

13:21.384 --> 13:23.302
- Now I am through with you.
- Go on.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.012
- And it's for good, do you hear?
- Go on.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.465
Get!

13:30.059 --> 13:32.102
Through for good.

13:34.105 --> 13:37.275
And I won't take you back
like I done before.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.444
What will you do now, Mr. Bigelow?

13:40.903 --> 13:45.449
Well, first of all, I'll go get
myself a glass of beer.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.702
Whenever anything bothers me,
I always drink a glass of beer.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.912
Then you are bothered
about losing your job.

13:50.913 --> 13:55.084
No, only about how
I'm gonna pay for the beer.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.329
Will you pay for it?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.666
You?

14:03.426 --> 14:06.926
- How much money you got?
- Forty-three cents.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.424
And you?

14:10.433 --> 14:13.807
I asked you how much money you got?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.687
Oh.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.438
You don't need to cry about it.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.985
If you ain't got it,
you ain't got it.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.905
Tell her to stop crying.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.074
Carrie.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.325
Well, that's better.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.332
I'm going over to the carousel
and get my things.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.707
Hey, you know that
bench down the road?

14:39.295 --> 14:43.671
The one by the... By the water,
the last one, by the tree.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.426
I'll meet you there.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.631
And then we'll go see about
having that drink.

14:53.518 --> 14:57.518
It's all right. Keep your money.
This time, I'll pay.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.482
Julie.

15:00.483 --> 15:01.855
Huh?

15:01.984 --> 15:03.985
I've been bustin' to tell
you something lately.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.438
You have?

15:06.656 --> 15:09.324
The reason I didn't care
to tell you before was...

15:09.325 --> 15:12.828
Well, 'cause you didn't
have a fella of your own.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.533
But now that you got one,
I can tell you about mine.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.833

18:58.554 --> 19:01.428
Come on. I don't wanna be late.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.065
Carrie, this is where
he meant us to wait.

19:13.903 --> 19:16.822
- You sure?
- Yes.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.406
- It's awful quiet here, Julie.
- Yes, it is.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.331
Hardly anyone ever goes past here.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.544
Do you think the stories
about him are true?

19:35.383 --> 19:36.630
Probably.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.517
Well...

19:45.518 --> 19:47.727
What are you girls doing here?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.271
You told us to wait for you.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.271
I meant she was to wait.
You can go home.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.944
Why, Mr. Bigelow.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.319
If you think either one of us
would stay here with you alo...

20:02.159 --> 20:04.160
Oh, Mr. Bigelow, it's late.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.371
If Julie stays,
she'll lose her job.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.499
Lose your job 'cause you stay
out late? Where do you work?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.167
At Bascombe's Cotton Mill.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.795
All Bascombe's girls
have to be respectable.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.755
We all have to live in
the mill boarding house

20:15.756 --> 20:19.467
and if we're late, they lock us out and
we can't go back to work there anymore.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.220
Is that right? They bounce you
if you ain't home on time?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.719
- That's right.
- It's late, Julie.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.843
We ought to go.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.682
Are you coming?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.933
Should I go, Julie?

20:34.400 --> 20:37.149
I can't tell you
what to do, Carrie.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.314
All right.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.237
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.862
Good-bye, Julie.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.698
Good-bye, Carrie.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.701
Well, now we're both out of jobs.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.046
- You had your supper?
- No.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.968
You want to eat out on the pier?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.466
No.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.979
You don't come around the
carousel very much, do you?

21:12.980 --> 21:15.940
I only seen you two or
three times before today.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.485
I've been there much
more than that.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.188
Is that right?

21:21.030 --> 21:23.073
- Did you see me?
- Yes.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.867
Did you know I was Billy Bigelow?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.911
The girls told me.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.374
- You got a sweetheart?
- No.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.668
- Now, don't lie to me.
- I haven't any.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.838
Why, you stayed here
the first time I asked you to.

21:38.839 --> 21:42.213
You wouldn't have stayed so quick
if you hadn't done it before.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.720
What did you stay for anyway?

21:46.555 --> 21:49.008
So you wouldn't be left alone.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.393
Holy smokes, you're dumb.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.979
I don't need to be alone. I can
have all the girls I want.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.397
Don't you know that?

21:56.398 --> 21:58.271
I know, Mr. Bigelow.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.815
All the girls are crazy for you.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.365
Well, that's more like it.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.077
You know what you remind me of?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.121
A girl I knew at Coney Island.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.620
Tell you how I met her.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.835
We was just putting out
the lights one night when...

22:16.836 --> 22:19.038
Is that you, Miss Jordan?

22:19.213 --> 22:21.086
Yes, Mr. Bascombe.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.763
- Whatever are you doing out at this hour?
- Well, I...

22:28.764 --> 22:31.933
You couldn't be home in time
now if you ran all the way.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.059
No, sir.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.227
And what's it your business?

22:34.228 --> 22:36.938
Mr. Bigelow, this is Mr. Bascombe.
He owns the mill.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.065
I don't care what he owns.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.110
If you ask me, he owns a lot of nerve.
What right's he got coming here...

22:42.111 --> 22:43.862
What's going on here?

22:43.863 --> 22:46.948
- Oh, good evening, Timmany.
- Evening, Mr. Bascombe.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.741
- Are you having trouble?
- Well...

22:48.742 --> 22:51.195
Him having trouble? Ask me.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.914
I was just setting here with my
lady friend not bothering nobody.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.249
And old sideburns here...

22:56.250 --> 22:58.585
Hear now, Bigelow. Don't be
calling Mr. Bascombe names

22:58.586 --> 23:01.421
unless you're fixing
to get yourself in trouble.

23:01.422 --> 23:04.299
- You know this fellow, Timmany?
- Yes, Mr. Bascombe.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.968
We have a report on him from
the chief of police of Bangor.

23:06.969 --> 23:10.805
He's a pretty fly gazabo.
Works on carousels.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.308
Makes a specialty out of
pretty young ones like this.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.767
Gets 'em all moony eyed,

23:14.768 --> 23:16.811
promises to marry 'em
then takes their money.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.980
I haven't got any money.

23:18.981 --> 23:22.317
- That's right. She ain't.
- Oh, you found that out already.

23:22.318 --> 23:25.820
Julie, you are a young
and inexperienced child.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.489
And I've decided to give you
one more chance.

23:28.490 --> 23:32.452
I'll take you back to the house myself
and explain everything to the matron.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.078
Come, my child.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.665
Well, don't stand there like
you didn't have good sense.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.868
Do I have to go with you?

23:40.377 --> 23:43.546
Well, no, you don't have to.

23:43.547 --> 23:47.175
- Then I'll stay.
- After I warned you.

23:47.176 --> 23:51.222
You see, Timmany? There are
some you just can't help.

23:52.181 --> 23:55.224
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Bascombe.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.269
You. I ought to throw you in jail.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.940
- What for?
- Don't know. Wish I did.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.776
Well, and then what?

24:07.905 --> 24:09.277
Huh?

24:09.823 --> 24:14.403
You were telling me a story. You were
just putting out the lights when...

24:16.121 --> 24:17.994
Oh, yeah.

24:19.625 --> 24:24.295
Well, just as the lights went out,
someone come along.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.749
It was this little girl,
the one with the...

24:28.884 --> 24:31.094
Tell me something. Ain't
you scared of me?

24:31.095 --> 24:35.345
I mean, after what that cop said
about me taking money from girls.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.430
I ain't scared.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.439
You're a funny kid.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.403
Well, you wanna go
into town and dance?

24:47.695 --> 24:51.115
Oh, no. I have to be careful.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.155
- Of what?
- My character.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.954
See, I'm never gonna marry.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.330
Huh?

24:59.331 --> 25:03.536
Well, a girl who don't marry has
gotta be much more particular.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.421
About what? Who she's seen with?

25:06.422 --> 25:09.250
Oh, no. No.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.302
About not letting other people
get the wrong impression.

25:13.303 --> 25:16.973
See, if... if I was gonna marry,

25:17.433 --> 25:20.056
it wouldn't make so
much difference.

25:20.561 --> 25:21.887
Oh.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.319
Suppose I was to say to you
that I'd marry you.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.404
You?

25:31.405 --> 25:35.033
That scares you, don't it? You're
thinking about what that cop said.

25:35.034 --> 25:39.159
No. Why, I never paid
no mind to what he said.

25:45.794 --> 25:49.839
Well, you wouldn't marry a fella
like me anyway, would you?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.008
Yes, I would...

25:52.009 --> 25:53.836
If I loved you.

25:54.511 --> 25:58.011
Why, it wouldn't make
any difference what you...

26:00.392 --> 26:02.594
Even if I died for it.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.022
Nah.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.025
How do you know what you'd do
if you loved me,

26:09.026 --> 26:11.354
how you'd feel or anything?

26:13.447 --> 26:15.445
I don't know how I'd know.

26:16.325 --> 26:19.077

coming down by theirselves.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.335
It's just their time to, I reckon.

34:53.049 --> 34:57.261
Well, you being Julie's only kinfolk,
I thought you'd want to know.

34:57.262 --> 35:00.389
Ain't seen that barker
from the carousel neither.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.765
He got bounced too.

35:01.766 --> 35:06.020
- If you ain't got any better than them...
- Oh, I got better. I got better.

35:06.021 --> 35:10.190
It could be accidental, them both
disappearing at the same time.

35:10.191 --> 35:13.027
All the same, it does
look a might peculiar.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.697
Nobody in our family ever did anything
to be ashamed of, Clem Hoops.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.907
Now, you just find me a couple
of good, big lobsters or get!

35:18.908 --> 35:20.485
Cousin Nettie!

35:21.244 --> 35:24.414
Julie, Julie.

35:25.457 --> 35:29.082
Julie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

35:29.544 --> 35:33.589
- I was wondering where you been.
- I been getting married, Cousin Nettie.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.884
This is my husband, Billy Bigelow.

35:36.593 --> 35:39.262
- Your husband?
- It's a fact, Nettie.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.131
Look.

35:42.807 --> 35:46.557
- It's pretty.
- Solid gold plated.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.941
I'm pleased to know
you, Mr. Bigelow.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.531
And I wish you both
all the happiness in the world.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.201
I'd have said it sooner,
but it's kind of a surprise.

36:02.202 --> 36:04.154
It takes a little getting used to.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.707
Me, I never got used to it.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.960
I just couldn't get
the hang of being married.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.129
Was that Julie's fault?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.424
I didn't say that.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.094
But maybe it wasn't
my fault either.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.889
There was only one
carousel in town.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.888
I couldn't go back there.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.972
- I didn't have a job.
- What did you live on?

36:33.983 --> 36:35.981
Her cousin Nettie.

36:37.445 --> 36:42.025
- To be perfectly honest with you, I tried...
- I would be if I were you.

36:43.785 --> 36:45.661
Me, I never got used to it.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.786
I didn't mind living
off her cousin Nettie.

36:49.124 --> 36:53.249
It was... It was just having
nothing to do that drove me crazy.

36:56.089 --> 36:59.884
Well, a couple of months went by.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.295
Then it was June.

37:03.263 --> 37:07.138
Everybody was getting ready for
the first clambake of the season.

37:08.810 --> 37:11.103
Excepting Julie and me,

37:11.104 --> 37:14.524

Hello there on the Nancy B.

46:14.438 --> 46:17.232
Hello there on the Nancy B.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.405
- Lookin' for somebody, miss?
- My husband.

46:23.406 --> 46:26.032
They told me he was with one
of your hands, Jigger Craigin.

46:26.033 --> 46:29.828
Could be, ma'am, but I ain't seen him.
The whole crew's gone ashore.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.291
They was, uh, figurin'
on goin' on that clambake.

46:34.292 --> 46:37.043
Maybe you can catch
up with them there.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.336
Thank you, sir.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.222
- She gone?
- Yeah.

46:49.223 --> 46:52.427
Billy, is that true?
ls there a clambake today?

46:52.685 --> 46:56.480
- Yeah. First one of the year.
- Yeah.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.399
Why don't we go?

46:59.400 --> 47:03.653
- What for?
- We'd come back rich. That's what for.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.489
Rich? From a clambake?
You'd be the first one.

47:06.490 --> 47:08.700
Jigger's been the first
one lots of times.

47:08.701 --> 47:11.161
What you need is a glass of beer.
Come on, I'm buying.

47:11.162 --> 47:13.956
That clambake's just
what I've been waitin' for.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.584
You couldn't find him, could you?

47:17.585 --> 47:19.294
- No.
- Hello, Julie.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.088
Hello, Carrie.

47:32.767 --> 47:36.437
Julie, is Billy working yet?

47:36.771 --> 47:38.439
No.

47:44.153 --> 47:48.984
Mr. Snow says a man that can't find
work these days is just bone lazy.

47:50.326 --> 47:54.406
Billy don't know any trade. He's
only good at what he used to do.

47:54.622 --> 47:57.415
So now he just don't do anything.

47:57.416 --> 47:59.751
You know something else, Carrie?

47:59.752 --> 48:02.629
- Last Monday, he hit her.
- Nettie.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.923
- Did you hit him back?
- Oh, no.

48:04.924 --> 48:07.634
Well, I would have. I'd leave him.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.928
You don't understand, Carrie.

48:09.929 --> 48:12.806
You see, he's unhappy
'cause he ain't working.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.724
That's why he hit me Monday.

48:14.725 --> 48:19.146
Fine reason for hitting you. Beats
his wife 'cause he ain't working.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.023
Is this before the
clambake, after or what?

48:22.024 --> 48:24.526
It's while the clambake's going on.

48:24.527 --> 48:27.320
Now, once we're out there,
suppose me and you get in a boat

48:27.321 --> 48:30.323
and come back in and
did whatever we had to do.

48:30.324 --> 48:32.450
Then we got back.
There's your alibi.

48:32.451 --> 48:36.079
We could just say, "We were on the
island all the time. We got lost."

48:36.080 --> 48:38.832
All right. What do we have to do?

48:38.833 --> 48:40.917
I mean me, what do I gotta do?

48:40.918 --> 48:44.003
Well, first, you go up
to old sideburns and you say,

48:44.004 --> 48:47.504
"Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"

48:48.509 --> 48:53.180
I say, "Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me the time?"

48:53.722 --> 48:54.806
Then what?

48:54.807 --> 48:57.517
Then by that time, I got
my knife in his ribs.

48:57.518 --> 49:00.062
- Then you take your knife...
- Me?

49:01.230 --> 49:03.106
I ain't got a knife.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.525
Well, you can get one, can't you?

49:05.526 --> 49:08.069
- Does he have to be killed?
- No, he don't have to be.

49:08.070 --> 49:11.406
But these New Englanders are
funny. They'd rather be killed.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.109
Well? Hmm?

49:13.576 --> 49:16.077
I ain't gonna do it. It's dirty.

49:16.078 --> 49:18.288
- What's dirty about it?
- Killing.

49:18.289 --> 49:19.539
What's the matter with you?

49:19.540 --> 49:21.374
We ain't gonna kill him.
We're just gonna scare him.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.919
That's what the knives
are for, to scare him.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.089
I ain't gonna do it, Jigger.

49:30.718 --> 49:32.552
Of course, if you've got
all the money you want...

49:32.553 --> 49:34.551
I ain't got a cent.

49:35.931 --> 49:38.099
Money thinks I'm dead.

49:41.896 --> 49:43.354
Julie?

49:43.355 --> 49:45.982
I got some good news to tell you.

49:45.983 --> 49:48.109
'Bout you and Mr. Snow?

49:51.572 --> 49:53.531
Carrie and me are bein'
cried in church on Sunday.

49:53.532 --> 49:57.282
Mr. Snow, you startled me!

50:01.665 --> 50:04.960
Well, this is him.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.831
- Carrie told me a lot about you.
- Oh.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.634
I told you a lot about
Julie, didn't I?

50:16.430 --> 50:18.181
Enoch's nice-lookin', ain't he?

50:18.182 --> 50:20.475
Oh, come, Carrie.

50:20.476 --> 50:22.678
Steady and reliable too.

50:24.522 --> 50:27.145
Well, ain't you gonna
wish us good luck?

50:31.445 --> 50:33.943
Course I wish you luck, Carrie.

50:35.866 --> 50:39.911
You can kiss Enoch too,
us bein' such good friends

50:39.912 --> 50:42.490
and me bein' right here
lookin' on at you.

50:50.089 --> 50:52.792
Why are you cryin', Mrs. Bigelow?

50:53.884 --> 50:56.803
It's because she has
such a good heart.

50:57.304 --> 51:00.390
We thank you for your
heartfelt sympathy.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.719
We thank you, Mrs. Bigelow.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.941
Billy! Billy.

51:15.114 --> 51:19.659
You know Carrie, and...
This is her intended, Mr. Snow.

51:19.660 --> 51:21.828
- Mr. Snow?
- Mr. Bigelow?

51:22.955 --> 51:25.123
I feel like I know you.

51:25.666 --> 51:29.086
Oh, yes. The man who
owns the herring boat.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.214
You smell it over there, Jigger?

51:33.215 --> 51:35.634
Nope. Wind's in the
wrong direction.

51:36.927 --> 51:40.847
- It's a good, honest smell!
- It's a powerful, honest smell.

51:40.848 --> 51:43.891
Carrie. You still want
me to offer him a job?

51:43.892 --> 51:44.976
What job?

51:44.977 --> 51:47.937
Mr. Snow here is thinkin'
of puttin' on another boat

51:47.938 --> 51:50.732
and I was gonna ask him to offer
you a job on it, but now I...

51:50.733 --> 51:53.026
Me? Work on a herring boat?

51:53.027 --> 51:56.195
No, thanks.

51:56.196 --> 52:00.526
Enoch, come along before you lose
your temper and do something violent.

52:03.954 --> 52:07.249
Well? Go ahead. Say it.

52:08.334 --> 52:11.002
I insulted your friends,
stayed out all night.

52:11.003 --> 52:14.172
I ain't workin'. I'm livin'
off your cousin Nettie.

52:14.173 --> 52:18.051
- I didn't say anything.
- No, but it was on the tip of your tongue.

52:18.052 --> 52:21.179
I was only gonna ask if... If you
wanted to go to the clambake.

52:21.180 --> 52:25.016
It's a good idea, Billy. You've been
actin' kind of nervous and edgy.

52:25.017 --> 52:27.477
Who knows? Maybe you
might find the treasure.

52:27.478 --> 52:29.976
No! Ain't goin' to no clambake.

52:34.026 --> 52:37.570
Well, you got anything else to say?

52:37.571 --> 52:39.530
Like what, Billy?

52:39.531 --> 52:42.530
Well, like whether
I'm hungry or not.

52:43.077 --> 52:47.205
I didn't have to ask that, Billy.
I knowed you was hungry.

52:47.206 --> 52:50.535
You go and sit down,
and I'll bring you your dinner.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.591
Do you wanna see somebody?

52:58.592 --> 53:02.387
Yeah, Billy.

53:02.388 --> 53:05.098
- That is, if he's home yet.
- He's home.

53:05.099 --> 53:07.558
Would it be asking too much
to know where he is?

53:07.559 --> 53:11.434
My husband is around the other
side, waitin' for his dinner.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.474
Thanks.

53:21.448 --> 53:23.321
Hello, Billy.

53:25.452 --> 53:26.953
Well, what'd you come for?

53:26.954 --> 53:30.456
Well, I see you're still hangin'
around your jailbird friend.

53:30.457 --> 53:32.458
What's it to you who
I hang around with?

53:32.459 --> 53:36.129
One thing I can't abide is
a common type woman.

53:36.130 --> 53:40.800
Everybody that gets mixed up with him
finishes up in the jailhouse or the grave.

53:40.801 --> 53:42.548
Common woman.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.891
Put on a new coat of paint. You're
startin' to peel, old pleasure boat.

53:50.602 --> 53:53.681
Well. What are you doin' here?

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:13.297
Oh, Billy, I'm so glad.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:16.591
I'll see if Carrie and Mr. Snow
have room for us.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:20.386
Oh, but... But you wouldn't
wanna go with them, would you?

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.514
Why, sure I would.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:25.017
You're puttin' the craziest
ideas into my head.

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:26.602
First I don't wanna
go on a clambake

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:30.063
and now I don't wanna go
with Carrie and Mr. Snow.

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.108
- Go on. Ask him. Go on.
- All right, Billy.

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:36.770
Change your mind, huh?

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:40.946
- Yeah.
- Good. Get the knife?

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:43.785
No, I haven't got it. No.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.035
Don't worry about it, mate.
Here's your coat.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.375
Billy! Billy! It's all right.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.874
- Come on!
- Comin', Julie.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:54.917
See you later, mate.

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.720
- Mr. Snow.
- Hello, Bigelow.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.188
Cast off the stern line.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:12.958
Julie...

01:10:12.959 --> 01:10:17.289
After the baby's born, maybe
we could go to San Francisco.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:21.676
- We'll take the kid with us, of course.
- Sure, Billy. Sure.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:27.265
You think I'm just talkin', huh?
You'll see.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:33.146
Carrie, can you imagine how it'll be
when all the kids are asleep upstairs?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.816
You and me sit alone
in the firelight.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:40.232
Me in my armchair,

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:43.572
you on my knee maybe?

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:44.281
Maybe.

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:44.823

- Enoch?
- Aye?

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:27.499
You found the treasure last year,
so it's your turn to hide it now.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.542
Enoch.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:31.628
And while Enoch's
hidin' the treasure,

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:34.172
all the rest of you get to work
and clean up this island.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:37.175
Can't leave it like this for
the next picnickers that come.

01:16:37.176 --> 01:16:38.259
Here it is, Enoch.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:42.431
Fall in and get to work, the whole kit and
caboodle of you. Burn all that rubbish.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:47.435
That's a well-set-up
little piece, that Carrie.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.521
Look. Ain't it near
time for us to start?

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.856
No. We'll wait till they
start the treasure hunt,

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.733
then we'll go together like a team.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:57.028
We'll get lost together like I said.
Did you get the knife?

01:16:57.029 --> 01:16:59.364
- No.
- Well, go ahead and take one.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:02.200
- Somebody might see me.
- Take it so they don't see you.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:05.075
I got some sweet
business to transact.

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:17.420
- Miss Pipperidge!
- Mr. Craigin!

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.384
No fair peekin'.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:21.678
Oh, I didn't come here
to find no treasure.

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:25.099
- You didn't?
- No. I come hereto protect you.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:27.433
You did?

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:29.686
What are you doin' out here alone?

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:32.063
Don't you know it's dangerous?

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:35.024
Suppose I was a different
type of fella.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:37.152
You know, unprincipled?

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:39.612
A fella who'd use physical
strength to have his will.

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:42.282
- There are such men, you know.
- I know, but...

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:45.285
Every girl oughta know how to defend
herself against brutes like that.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.829
Now there are certain holds
in wrestlin' I could teach you.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.582
Trick's that'd land a masher
flat on his face in two minutes.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:53.377
- I ain't strong enough.
- Oh, it don't take strength.

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:55.503
It's just a matter of balance.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.378
A twist of the wrist,
a dig with the elbow.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.800
Here, let me show you a simple one.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.052
This might save your life someday.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.473
Now, suppose a fella...

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.519
gets a hold of you like this!

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:14.223
Now you put your two
hands on my neck.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:19.485
Now pull me towards you.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:22.986
That's it. Now pull my head down.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:29.539
Good. Now put your left arm
all the way around my neck.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:31.828
Ah.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:35.251
Now squeeze... Hard!

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:37.375
Tighter!

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.961
Good girl.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:43.670
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, you got me helpless.

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:51.014
Show me another one.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:54.517
Uh, right... Uh...

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:58.483
Here's how you can pick a
fella up and send him sprawlin'.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:00.735
Now, I'll just stand here
and you get a hold of...

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.190
Uh, no. No. Wait a minute.

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:08.865
I'll do it to you first,
and then you can do it to me.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:13.283
- All right.
- And you just stand still and relax.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:19.712
This is... This is the way
firemen carry people.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.005
It is?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:24.300
You see how helpless you can make a
fella if he gets fresh with you?

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:26.469
Aye.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.887
Ah, Miss Pipperidge.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.556
- I'm just crazy for you.
- Mr. Craigin...

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:32.684
Why, just to see your lovely smile,

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:35.728
I'd swim through beer
with my mouth closed.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.055
Oh!

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:41.314
Oh. Hello, Enoch.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:45.071
This is the way
firemen carry people.

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:46.615
Where's the fire?

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:53.037
He... He was just showin'
me how to defend myself.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.415
It didn't look like you'd learned
very much by the time I came.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.542
That's 'cause you came too early.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:20:00.920
In my opinion, sir, you are
as scurvy a hunk of scum

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.047
as I ever seen near the
water's edge at low tide.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:06.676
What's all the fussin' and
fuzzlin' and wuzzlin' about?

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.720
I never thought I'd see
the woman I'm engaged to

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:10.888
bein' carried out of the
woods like a fallen deer.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:13.391
Oh, no, Enoch. He wasn't
carryin' me out of the woods.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.518
He was carryin' me into the woods.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.103
Oh, no. I don't mean that.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:19.939
I think we have said
all we have to say.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.359
I can't abide women who are
free, loose and lollygaggin'.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.733
And I certainly would
never marry one.

01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:27.280
Enoch!

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:29.532
Aw, let him go, Carrie.

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:32.327
- You don't know when you're lucky.
- You keep out of this!

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.620
- Ooh!
- Enoch!

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:36.080
Oh, Carrie.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.583

For the rich, fine music
and chubby little angels.

01:27:18.442 --> 01:27:22.403
- Won't we have any music?
- Not one blasted note.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:26.154
All we'll get is justice, and there'll
be plenty of that for you and me.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:30.199
Say. Come on. Let's
play some cards.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:33.202
It'll pass the time.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:36.910
We'll play twenty-one. I'll bank.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:40.838
What'll you bank?
I ain't got any money.

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:43.340
You can play on credit.
I'll deduct it.

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:47.178
- From what?
- From your share of the money.

01:27:47.179 --> 01:27:50.258
If you win, you can
deduct it from my share.

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:53.392
Bascombe'll have 3,000 on him.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:55.311

to the captain,

01:27:55.312 --> 01:27:57.104
only tonight the
captain don't get it.

01:27:57.105 --> 01:28:00.275
We get it. 1,500 to
you, 1,500 to me.

01:28:01.693 --> 01:28:04.987
Go ahead and deal. I'll bet 50.

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:06.906
Make it 100.

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:10.736
Nothin'.

01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:13.488
Twenty-one.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:19.078
- This time, double or nothin'.
- Double or nothin' 'tis.

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.167
I got enough.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.971
- Twenty-one.
- Are you cheatin'?

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:33.137
Do I look like a cheat?

01:28:35.268 --> 01:28:38.729
- 500.
- Say, you're a plunger, ain't you?

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.603
Yes, sir.

01:28:43.693 --> 01:28:45.520
I'll take another.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:48.945
Ah, too much.

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:53.696
- Uh, that makes 700 you owe me.
- $700?

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.787
Double or nothin'.

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:07.796
- I'll stand.
- Twenty-one.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:09.343
A natural.

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:12.429
Why you... You stinkin' crook.
You are cheatin' me.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:15.558

Go, go! The time! The time!

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:19.095
Excuse me?

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.940
Say, excuse me, sir.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:24.817
Could you, uh, tell me the time?

01:29:24.818 --> 01:29:27.237
Gimme that money and be quick!

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:31.198
- Look out. He's got a gun.
- Don't move, either one of you.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.493
Drop that knife.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.580

bullet in here for you.

Look behind you.
What do you see comin'?

01:29:57.350 --> 01:30:00.477
- Two policemen.
- You wanted to know what time it was?

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:02.021
I'll tell you.

01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:04.725
For you, it'll be 10
or 20 years in prison.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:08.270
They ain't gonna put
me in no prison.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:14.776

escaping to? The sky?

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.013

up Maple Street.

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:38.349
Hey, you! Come on. Get up.

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:40.517

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:42.478
Yes, Captain Watson.

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:44.980
- Yes, I'm all right.

01:30:44.981 --> 01:30:48.355
Why, those fools.
Those silly fools.

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:51.195
They tried to rob me.

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:54.275
They didn't notice that I was
comin' from the ship, not to it.

01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:58.160
Say, this man's hurt bad.
He must have fell on his knife.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:31:00.601
The money they tried to kill me
for is locked up in your safe.

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:03.742

- You. Get a doctor.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:07.002

So, that's the way it was.

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.053
Yeah.

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:59.307
When you first got here, you had
the right to go back for one day,

01:38:59.308 --> 01:39:00.684
and you didn't.

01:39:00.685 --> 01:39:04.139
Wasn't there anything
you wanted to do down there?

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.561
Yeah.

01:39:07.567 --> 01:39:10.316
Yeah, I wanted to
break Jigger's head.

01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:14.114
As a matter of fact,
it's still a good idea.

01:39:14.115 --> 01:39:17.114
You won't find Jigger
down there anymore.

01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:20.704
- You mean he's here?
- No, no.

01:39:20.705 --> 01:39:23.033
He didn't even get this far.

01:39:25.126 --> 01:39:27.711
Hey, tell me. What do
you got him doing?

01:39:27.712 --> 01:39:30.088
That's not your concern.

01:39:30.089 --> 01:39:35.427
Bigelow, you left your wife
havin' a baby comin'

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:37.846
with nothing to support 'em.

01:39:37.847 --> 01:39:39.765
Why'd you do that?

01:39:46.272 --> 01:39:48.600
I... I couldn't get work.

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:52.736
And I... I couldn't bear to
see her... To see her...

01:39:52.737 --> 01:39:55.113
You couldn't bear to see her cry.

01:39:55.114 --> 01:39:57.657
Why don't you come
right out and say it?

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.452
Why are you afraid to
use the right words?

01:40:00.453 --> 01:40:02.621
Why are you ashamed you love Julie?

01:40:02.622 --> 01:40:05.749
- I ain't ashamed of anything.
- Then why did you beat her?

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:07.623
I didn't beat her.

01:40:08.586 --> 01:40:11.289
- I hit her.
- Why?

01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:16.920
Well, we'd argue.
She'd say this. I'd say that.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.346
And she'd be right.

01:40:19.347 --> 01:40:21.015
So I hit her.

01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:23.934
Are you sorry you hit her?

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:26.263
I ain't sorry for anything.

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:29.731
Look, I told you before.
I ain't no special case.

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:32.067
If I can't go back, just say so.

01:40:32.068 --> 01:40:34.402
I didn't say you can't go back.

01:40:34.403 --> 01:40:36.571
No, but you didn't
say I could either.

01:40:36.572 --> 01:40:39.400
You're... You're just
trying to make me sweat.

01:40:39.617 --> 01:40:41.114
No, I...

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:47.618
I'm just trying to figure out what good
you could do if I let you go back.

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:53.502
You know, your
daughter's down there.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.214
She's unhappy. She needs help.

01:41:00.137 --> 01:41:02.222
My daughter?

01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:05.308
My baby... Is a girl?
My baby's a girl?

01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:09.514
No, she isn't a baby anymore.
She's 15 years old.

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:15.735
And she ain't happy, huh?

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:17.445
No, she ain't, Billy. She's...

01:41:17.446 --> 01:41:19.739
You know, she's a lot like you.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:22.826
That's why I think
maybe you could help her.

01:41:22.827 --> 01:41:25.701
Do you... Do you wanna
take a look at her?

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:29.082
Could I... Could I
see her from here?

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:31.536
Sure, you can, if you want to.

01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:38.091
Nah. If she ain't happy,
I don't wanna look.

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:42.012
Well, right now, she appears
to be having a fine time.

01:41:42.013 --> 01:41:45.473
Yes, sir. There she is
running along the beach there,

01:41:45.474 --> 01:41:48.018
got her shoes and stockings off.

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:52.223
- Like I used to do, huh?
- Yeah.

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:56.318
Don't you think you
better take a look?

01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:01.699
Well, what do I have
to do to see her?

01:42:02.283 --> 01:42:04.952
Just look and wait.

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:08.872
And the power to see
her will come to you.

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:23.553
Is that her?

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:25.472
Pretty, ain't she?

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:31.012
My little girl, huh?

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.646
Let's go, Billy.

01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:40.317
All right, Billy.

01:43:49.682 --> 01:43:53.011
- Look, can she see me?
- Only if you want her to.

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:20.957
My father bought me
my pretty dress.

01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:24.419
My father would've bought me
a pretty dress, too.

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.796
He was a barker on a carousel.

01:46:26.797 --> 01:46:28.999
Your father was a thief.

01:53:16.915 --> 01:53:19.709
Shame on you. Shame on you.

01:53:19.710 --> 01:53:22.295
Shame on you. Shame on you.

01:53:22.296 --> 01:53:25.631
- Shame on you. Shame on you.
- Oh, no.

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:27.300
- No!
- Shame on you. Shame on you.

01:53:27.301 --> 01:53:32.221
Shame, shame, shame, shame!
Shame, shame, shame, shame!

01:53:40.188 --> 01:53:42.436
I hate you.

01:53:43.275 --> 01:53:46.228
I hate all of you.

01:54:14.639 --> 01:54:16.807
Why did I have to look?

01:54:18.226 --> 01:54:20.102
Poor kid. I know what
she's going through.

01:54:20.103 --> 01:54:23.648
Something like what happened to
you when you was a kid, ain't it?

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:28.277
- What did I come down here for?
- To help her, ain't that so?

01:54:28.278 --> 01:54:29.775
Come on.

01:54:52.803 --> 01:54:54.387
Julie managed all right, I guess.

01:54:54.388 --> 01:54:56.590
Yep, she had to.

01:54:57.224 --> 01:54:59.975
She's got a lot of grit, Billy.

01:54:59.976 --> 01:55:01.678
Come along, children.

01:55:19.329 --> 01:55:21.914
Mr. Snow. Children.

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:25.418
- Morning, Mrs. Bigelow.
- Morning, Mrs. Bigelow.

01:55:25.419 --> 01:55:28.546
Well, it's so nice to see you.
Won't you come in?

01:55:28.547 --> 01:55:30.714
Thank you, no, Mrs. Bigelow.
Afraid we haven't time.

01:55:30.715 --> 01:55:32.591
Just came by for my wife.

01:55:32.592 --> 01:55:35.594
We have to stop at the minister's
house on our way to the graduation.

01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:37.805
I tell ya.

01:55:37.806 --> 01:55:40.850
- Carrie, Carrie, we're waiting.
- Coming. I heard you.

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:44.061
You'll be to the
graduation, won't you?

01:55:44.062 --> 01:55:47.773
Well, of course I will. Louise
is graduating too, you know.

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:51.360
- Carrie.
- Oh, I'm coming, Enoch. What's the rush?

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:55.406
I was telling Julie about that musical
extravaganza we saw in New York.

01:55:55.407 --> 01:55:57.867
♪ I'm a tomboy
Just a tomboy ♪

01:55:57.868 --> 01:55:59.535
♪ I'm a madcap maiden
from Broadway ♪

01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:03.456
We also saw Julius Caesar. Ain't that
a better show to tell her about?

01:56:03.457 --> 01:56:08.210
Not for me. Why, I took one look at them
men in nightgowns and went right to sleep.

01:56:08.211 --> 01:56:10.963
Good-bye, Mrs. Bigelow.
Come along, children.

01:56:10.964 --> 01:56:13.132
- Good-bye, Julie.
- Pa, can I stay and talk to Louise?

01:56:13.133 --> 01:56:15.301
- No.
- Just five minutes.

01:56:15.302 --> 01:56:19.257
- Let him.
- Very well. Five minutes, no more.

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:22.016
Still lollygagging.

01:56:22.017 --> 01:56:25.060
You'd think a woman with nine
children would have more sense.

01:56:25.061 --> 01:56:28.435
If I had more sense,
I wouldn't have nine children.

01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:34.570
Oh, Louise, your graduation
dress is finished.

01:56:34.571 --> 01:56:36.155
You won't forget to come
in and have it fitted.

01:56:36.156 --> 01:56:38.108
I won't forget, Mother.

01:56:39.159 --> 01:56:41.577
Did you have a good time
in New York, Enoch?

01:56:41.578 --> 01:56:44.330
Oh, yes. We went to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.

01:56:44.331 --> 01:56:46.790
We went to the aquarium.
We went to all the theaters.

01:56:46.791 --> 01:56:49.039
- Enoch. Come here.
- Huh?

01:56:51.963 --> 01:56:54.089
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:57.134
What's the secret?

01:56:57.135 --> 01:56:59.386
I'm gonna be an actress.

01:56:59.387 --> 01:57:01.514
There's a troupe coming
through here next week.

01:57:01.515 --> 01:57:05.059
I met a fella. He says he's
the advance man or something.

01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:07.520
- And he says he'll help me.
- You mean run away?

01:57:07.521 --> 01:57:08.729
Shh.

01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:10.564
I won't let you do it.

01:57:10.565 --> 01:57:12.312
Well, how will you stop me?

01:57:12.776 --> 01:57:15.069
I'll marry you. That's how.

01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:17.819
- Will you, Enoch?
- Sure.

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:23.202
Of course it'll be a little hard persuading
Papa to let me marry beneath my station.

01:57:23.203 --> 01:57:27.328
- But I'll do it.
- Beneath your station?

01:57:28.208 --> 01:57:31.582
Don't bother persuading
your papa about anything.

01:57:31.962 --> 01:57:34.672
I wouldn't have that stuck-up
buzzard for a father-in-law

01:57:34.673 --> 01:57:36.715
if you give me a million dollars.

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:40.427
You're a fine one to talk about my
father. What about your own?

01:57:40.428 --> 01:57:43.806
A cheap barker on a carousel.
He even beat your mother.

01:57:43.807 --> 01:57:47.762
You get out of here, you sneaky
little la-di-da. I'll kill you!

01:58:01.449 --> 01:58:04.072
If I want her to see me, she will?

01:58:12.294 --> 01:58:13.871
Little girl.

01:58:16.506 --> 01:58:18.128
Louise.

01:58:20.594 --> 01:58:24.344
Who are you? How would
you know my name?

01:58:25.056 --> 01:58:28.556
Somebody... Somebody
told me you lived here.

01:58:29.603 --> 01:58:31.271
I, uh...

01:58:32.814 --> 01:58:36.025
- I knew your father.
- My father?

01:58:36.026 --> 01:58:40.863
And I heard what that little pumpkin head
said, and it ain't true, none of it.

01:58:40.864 --> 01:58:44.193
It is true, all of it.

01:58:46.286 --> 01:58:48.409
Did your mother tell you that?

01:58:48.747 --> 01:58:51.700
No, but every kid in town knows it.

01:58:52.125 --> 01:58:55.454
They've been throwing it up at
me ever since I can remember.

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:58.210
I wish I was dead.

01:59:01.092 --> 01:59:03.966
What did your mother
tell you about him?

01:59:07.057 --> 01:59:09.808
Well, she's told me a
lot of fairy stories,

01:59:09.809 --> 01:59:12.432
about how he died in San Francisco.

01:59:13.313 --> 01:59:16.398
She's always saying what
a handsome fella he was.

01:59:16.399 --> 01:59:18.943
Well, he was.

01:59:20.153 --> 01:59:21.403
Was he really?

01:59:21.404 --> 01:59:24.653
Well, he was the handsomest
fella around here.

01:59:25.575 --> 01:59:29.370
You really knew him, did you?
And he was handsome?

01:59:29.871 --> 01:59:30.954
What else about him?

01:59:30.955 --> 01:59:33.704
Do you know anything else
good about him?

01:59:37.253 --> 01:59:40.589
He used to tell funny jokes at the
carousel. And he made people laugh.

01:59:40.590 --> 01:59:42.633
Oh, did he? What else?

01:59:44.594 --> 01:59:48.094
Look, I wanna give you a present.

01:59:48.431 --> 01:59:51.058
I can't take presents
from strangers.

01:59:51.059 --> 01:59:52.935
My mother wouldn't like it.

01:59:52.936 --> 01:59:55.270
I don't mean you any harm, child.

01:59:55.271 --> 01:59:58.607
- I just wanna give you something.
- Don't you come any closer.

01:59:58.608 --> 02:00:00.609
You go away. You scare me.

02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:04.690
Don't send me away, dear, I... I
just wanna give you a present.

02:00:05.073 --> 02:00:08.493
Something pretty.
Something wonderful.

02:00:10.161 --> 02:00:11.328
Psst.

02:00:11.329 --> 02:00:12.906
What's that?

02:00:14.499 --> 02:00:16.042
A star.

02:00:17.794 --> 02:00:21.296
- Go away.
- Please, darling. I just want to help you.

02:00:21.297 --> 02:00:23.549
Don't call me darling.
Let go of my hand.

02:00:23.550 --> 02:00:25.634
Please, dear.
I just want to make you happy.

02:00:25.635 --> 02:00:27.136
- Take it.
- No.

02:00:27.137 --> 02:00:28.303
- Please.
- No.

02:00:28.304 --> 02:00:30.177
- Please, dear.
- No!

02:00:30.807 --> 02:00:33.510
Mother! Mother!

02:00:34.018 --> 02:00:37.020
Failure. You struck
out blind again.

02:00:37.021 --> 02:00:40.524
All you ever do to get out of a
difficulty is hit someone you love.

02:00:40.525 --> 02:00:42.776
- Failure.
- Where is he?

02:00:42.777 --> 02:00:45.362
- I don't want her to see me.
- Then she don't.

02:00:45.363 --> 02:00:48.567
She looked like she saw
me before I said that.

02:00:53.997 --> 02:00:55.870
Oh, he's gone.

02:00:56.666 --> 02:00:58.333
I didn't make it up,
Mother. Honest.

02:00:58.334 --> 02:01:01.879
There was a strange man
here, and he hit me hard.

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:05.591
I heard the sound of it, Mother.

02:01:05.592 --> 02:01:09.387
But it didn't hurt. It
didn't hurt at all.

02:01:10.805 --> 02:01:13.053
It was just as if
he kissed my hand.

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:16.678
Go into the house, Louise.

02:01:18.354 --> 02:01:21.648
What's happened, Mother?
Don't you believe me?

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:23.351
I believe you.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.860
Then why don't you tell me
why you're acting so funny?

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.033
Oh, it's nothing, darling.

02:01:31.034 --> 02:01:35.537
But is it possible, Mother? For
someone to hit you hard like that,

02:01:35.538 --> 02:01:37.411
real loud and hard,

02:01:38.333 --> 02:01:40.501
and not hurt you at all?

02:01:40.835 --> 02:01:43.037
It is possible, dear,

02:01:43.838 --> 02:01:47.463
for someone to hit
you, hit you hard,

02:01:48.718 --> 02:01:50.761
and it not hurt at all.

02:02:04.734 --> 02:02:05.901
Julie.

02:02:16.913 --> 02:02:18.535

Seems like she knew I was here.

02:03:56.346 --> 02:03:58.548
Julie would always know.

02:03:59.557 --> 02:04:03.011
- She never changes.
- Nope, Julie never changes.

02:04:04.062 --> 02:04:06.730
But my little girl, my Louise...

02:04:06.731 --> 02:04:09.650
- I gotta do something for her.
- So far, you ain't done much.

02:04:09.651 --> 02:04:12.194
- I know, I know.
- Time's running out.

02:04:12.195 --> 02:04:14.363
But it ain't over yet.

02:04:14.364 --> 02:04:17.067
Look. I want an extension.

02:04:19.535 --> 02:04:22.784

- All right, Billy.

02:04:29.879 --> 02:04:31.713
Enoch Snow Jr.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.887
Miss Louise Bigelow.

02:04:49.983 --> 02:04:53.652
Our speaker this year
is the most popular,

02:04:53.653 --> 02:04:56.405
best beloved man in our town,

02:04:56.406 --> 02:04:57.949
Dr. Seldon.

02:05:05.123 --> 02:05:07.916
He reminds me of that fella
up there, that star keeper.

02:05:07.917 --> 02:05:12.170
Yep. A lot of these country doctors
and preachers remind you of him.

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:15.295
It's the custom at
these graduations

02:05:15.633 --> 02:05:20.179
to pick out some old duck like
me to preach at the kids.

02:05:22.557 --> 02:05:24.725
Well, I can't preach at you.

02:05:24.726 --> 02:05:26.935
I know you all too well.

02:05:26.936 --> 02:05:29.730
I brought most of
you into the world,

02:05:29.731 --> 02:05:32.190
rubbed liniment on your backs,

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:34.439
poured castor oil
down your throats.

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:38.947
I only hope that now
I got you this far,

02:05:38.948 --> 02:05:43.073
you'll turn out to be worth all
the trouble I took with you.

02:05:44.454 --> 02:05:46.076
I...

02:05:46.956 --> 02:05:51.206
I can't tell you any
sure way to happiness.

02:05:51.627 --> 02:05:56.503
I only know that you've gotta go
out and find it for yourselves.

02:05:57.633 --> 02:06:00.302
You can't lean on
the success of your parents.

02:06:00.803 --> 02:06:02.721
That's their success.

02:06:03.264 --> 02:06:07.809
- And don't be held back by their failures.
- Listen to him. Believe him.

02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:11.354
It makes no difference
what they did or didn't do.

02:06:11.355 --> 02:06:14.229
You just stand on
your own two feet.

02:06:15.693 --> 02:06:21.525
The world belongs to you
as much as to the next fella.

02:06:21.699 --> 02:06:23.697
So don't give it up.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:27.990
And try not to be scared
of people not liking you.

02:06:28.498 --> 02:06:30.996
Just you try liking them.

02:06:31.918 --> 02:06:36.043
And just keep your
faith and your courage

02:06:36.839 --> 02:06:39.383
and you'll turn out all right.

02:06:40.259 --> 02:06:44.054
It's like what we used to sing every
morning when I was a boy at school.

02:06:44.055 --> 02:06:46.257
Maybe you still sing it.

02:06:48.017 --> 02:06:50.219

02:06:51.104 --> 02:06:53.230
