WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:03.792
We're still short-staffed
so if you happen

00:03.793 --> 00:05.927
to be walking through the
parking lot at night

00:05.928 --> 00:08.715
and there's a loose cart,
maybe just grab it

00:08.716 --> 00:10.416
and stick it in the corral.

00:10.418 --> 00:13.452
Gotta round up those
doggies, yee-haw...

00:13.454 --> 00:15.688
That's the saddest "yee-haw"
I've ever heard.

00:15.690 --> 00:17.590
Yeah, I... I bailed on it. Carol?

00:17.592 --> 00:21.451
I hate to even bring this up,
but should Sandra be here?

00:21.896 --> 00:23.262
I thought she was fired.

00:23.264 --> 00:24.730
Yes. She was.

00:24.732 --> 00:27.600
Until she started talking about unions.

00:27.602 --> 00:29.635
Apparently firing someone
for trying to unionize

00:29.637 --> 00:32.037
is considered retaliation.
I would accompany

00:32.039 --> 00:33.806
that statement with a vigorous
jerking-back-and-forth

00:33.808 --> 00:36.296
hand gesture,
but that's also prohibited.

00:36.611 --> 00:38.577
Okay. Now for the rest of you cowpokes,

00:38.579 --> 00:40.179
let's saddle up and git!

00:40.181 --> 00:41.747
- Oof.
- The Western thing

00:41.749 --> 00:43.682
is just not in your wheelhouse.

00:43.684 --> 00:45.885
Amy, could I say a few words?

00:45.887 --> 00:47.405
Um, okay.

00:48.556 --> 00:50.033
Screw management!

00:51.259 --> 00:53.192
- Okay.
- Once we clock out

00:53.194 --> 00:55.427
Amy can't make us do a damn thing.

00:55.428 --> 00:57.470
If you see a loose cart
in the parking lot,

00:57.471 --> 00:59.665
you can kick it over
or shove it into traffic.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.634
Seems like just as much work?

01:01.636 --> 01:04.904
Also, managers can't
give us polygraph tests.

01:04.906 --> 01:07.373
I wasn't planning on giving
anyone a polygraph test.

01:07.487 --> 01:08.398
Well, good.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.668
'Cause we ain't taking one, Amy.

01:11.345 --> 01:13.178
- Mm-hmm.
- Stay strong, people.

01:13.180 --> 01:16.015
Whoo!

01:20.721 --> 01:23.522
We have a right to healthy air quality

01:23.524 --> 01:26.667
and adequate airflow.
Do you feel any airflow?

01:26.668 --> 01:28.127
'Cause I don't feel any airflow.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.062
You thinks he actually cares
about any of this stuff

01:30.064 --> 01:31.797
or is it just about getting attention?

01:31.799 --> 01:34.800
I mean, it's definitely the attention.

01:34.802 --> 01:37.069
A week ago she was eating lunch
by herself in the bathroom

01:37.071 --> 01:40.239
and now, well, she's
the AOC of Store 1217.

01:40.241 --> 01:43.279
It's crazy how she can just
go with it when this is all

01:43.280 --> 01:45.144
based on tweets that we wrote.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.512
Do you think all great leaders

01:46.514 --> 01:48.380
are just sociopaths living a lie?

01:48.382 --> 01:49.448
Um...

01:49.517 --> 01:50.883
Yeah, probably.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.484
I mean, even Obama had those guys

01:52.486 --> 01:54.653
who made him feel "good" at basketball.

02:02.530 --> 02:04.897
Yo, those dressing rooms are trashed.

02:04.899 --> 02:06.674
It's like "The Leftovers" in there.

02:09.937 --> 02:12.137
You know, like that show
where everybody disappears

02:12.139 --> 02:14.191
and all that's left
is the pile of their clothes?

02:14.575 --> 02:15.941
You're a terrible person.

02:16.644 --> 02:19.341
- Okay?
- Dina told us about the birds.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.919
- Oh.
- Oh?

02:21.015 --> 02:22.348
Is that what it's called

02:22.350 --> 02:24.650
when you let someone's birds escape

02:24.652 --> 02:26.352
and then let her think it's her fault

02:26.354 --> 02:29.922
and you go to her place
and you put your filth in her?

02:29.924 --> 02:31.824
Look, guys, I feel really bad about it.

02:31.826 --> 02:34.793
You know, I used to think
that you were a nice guy

02:34.795 --> 02:36.996
who just said mean things
to people to be funny,

02:36.998 --> 02:40.432
but now I feel like maybe
you're just a mean person.

02:40.434 --> 02:42.234
I'm so disappointed in you, Garrett.

02:42.236 --> 02:45.571
- Glenn, I... you gotta...
- Oh! And by the way,

02:45.573 --> 02:47.714
have you ever even seen
"The Leftovers"?

02:48.075 --> 02:50.142
The clothes disappear too, dick.

02:51.545 --> 02:53.635
Everybody's acting
like I killed their birds.

02:53.848 --> 02:55.681
Not that I killed Dina's birds.

02:55.683 --> 02:57.549
I mean, they could still be
alive, as far as we know.

02:57.551 --> 02:59.118
Yeah, I mean, it's only been

02:59.120 --> 03:01.620
a few months and one of the
coldest winters on record,

03:01.622 --> 03:03.522
they could be barely clinging
to life somewhere.

03:03.524 --> 03:05.524
I mean, even Glenn
thinks I'm a bad person,

03:05.526 --> 03:06.992
and he sees the good in everyone.

03:06.994 --> 03:08.827
And when that warehouse guy
on meth choked him out?

03:08.829 --> 03:11.225
Glen apologized for looking
too much like a dragon.

03:11.699 --> 03:13.565
He was on meth?
I thought it was bath salts.

03:13.567 --> 03:15.134
Man, how is that relevant
to the conversation?

03:15.136 --> 03:17.036
I don't know. I don't know
where it's going yet.

03:17.038 --> 03:20.835
Look all I'm saying is maybe
Dina's the bad person here.

03:21.442 --> 03:22.741
She kept birds in cages.

03:22.743 --> 03:24.210
Birds are supposed to be free.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.779
So you're actually a hero.

03:27.449 --> 03:28.466
Cool take.

03:28.489 --> 03:29.848
You know what? I saw you eating

03:29.850 --> 03:30.849
a chicken sandwich yesterday.

03:30.851 --> 03:32.251
You're not better than me.

03:33.788 --> 03:35.354
It was a turkey wrap.

03:35.356 --> 03:36.629
Still a bird!

03:37.224 --> 03:38.957
So, Amy, I hear there's some talk

03:38.959 --> 03:41.460
of unionizing down there?

03:41.462 --> 03:43.062
No, no! God, no.

03:43.064 --> 03:45.264
I mean, I wouldn't even call it "talk."

03:45.266 --> 03:46.799
It's just... it's Sandra.

03:46.801 --> 03:49.334
Okay. Amy, this is a big deal.

03:49.336 --> 03:52.104
They're looking at shutting
down some of the stores.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.907
- What?
- Am I a puppy again?

03:54.909 --> 03:56.175
- I'm sorry, one second.
- No, it's fine.

03:56.177 --> 03:57.609
Jeff, it's fine.

03:57.611 --> 04:00.012
Just... what stores
are they shutting down?

04:00.014 --> 04:01.980
- Jeff, leave it!
- Okay. Fine, sorry.

04:01.982 --> 04:03.649
Just... can you keep this between us?

04:03.651 --> 04:05.584
- Yes! Of course.
- We're converting some of

04:05.586 --> 04:07.753
the brick and mortars
into distribution centers

04:07.755 --> 04:10.026
And one of those stores is going
to come from your district.

04:10.027 --> 04:12.565
So if they hear you're
talking about unionizing,

04:12.566 --> 04:14.486
it's going to make
their decision a lot easier.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.015
So you need to squash this.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:26.874 --> 04:28.540
Look. All we have to do

04:28.542 --> 04:30.476
is keep her from talking about unions.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.478
Yes.

04:31.745 --> 04:33.645
- What?
- Uh, just feels weird.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.681
Isn't that like literally
union-busting?

04:35.683 --> 04:37.282
- No!
- What would you call it?

04:37.284 --> 04:38.984
I don't know. It's not like we're

04:38.986 --> 04:41.587
crushing a movement.
We're just trying to...

04:41.589 --> 04:42.855
Send her a message?

04:42.857 --> 04:44.157
That sounds like
we're breaking her legs.

04:44.158 --> 04:44.928
We just want to...

04:44.929 --> 04:47.493
Neutralize the threat, uh,
get rid of the problem, uh,

04:47.495 --> 04:49.135
let her know she's messing
with the wrong people.

04:49.136 --> 04:51.163
- Something in that ballpark.
- It just feels like a red flag

04:51.165 --> 04:52.826
that everything you say
makes us sound like villains.

04:52.827 --> 04:54.500
Look, we're just trying to stop

04:54.502 --> 04:57.836
one lonely desperate lunatic
from running her mouth

04:57.838 --> 04:59.605
and costing everybody their jobs.

04:59.607 --> 05:01.940
- We're the good guys.
- I guess.

05:01.942 --> 05:04.674
We just want Sandra to do what's
best for her fellow workers.

05:05.446 --> 05:06.449
Or else.

05:07.081 --> 05:08.981
As soon as I said it, I heard it.

05:08.983 --> 05:10.282
It's... it's a problem.

05:16.347 --> 05:18.447
Ooh, hey, Myrtle.
You look a little chilly.

05:18.449 --> 05:19.516
Thought you might need this.

05:19.517 --> 05:22.084
- Oh, thank you!
- Yeah, it's no problem.

05:22.086 --> 05:23.701
This is great!

05:24.322 --> 05:25.754
- Thank you so much!
- Hey. Actually, you know what?

05:25.756 --> 05:26.726
Could you give it back
to me real quick?

05:26.727 --> 05:28.282
Hey! You can't take my shawl back!

05:28.283 --> 05:29.681
I just... it's just that I want...

05:29.682 --> 05:31.660
Help! He's stealing my shawl!

05:31.662 --> 05:32.991
- Give her back her shawl!
- No, no, no!

05:32.992 --> 05:34.430
I brought it to her!
I brought it to her!

05:34.432 --> 05:37.016
I'll get you your own shawl, okay?

05:38.369 --> 05:40.145
Here. There you go, sweetie.

05:40.805 --> 05:43.105
- So... cold...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

05:43.107 --> 05:45.592
But everything's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:46.077 --> 05:47.177
Rise up.

05:48.446 --> 05:50.640
Stand up for your rights.
Power to the people.

05:51.581 --> 05:52.677
Cute top!

05:52.983 --> 05:56.251
Hey, Sandra. Um, handing
out some flyers?

05:56.253 --> 05:57.591
Yeah, do you want one?

05:58.022 --> 06:01.429
Sandra says "no" to hate
and "yes" to freedom.

06:02.093 --> 06:03.992
Seems uncontroversial.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.260
I'm not a hero.

06:05.262 --> 06:07.896
So, um, Sandra, I-I need you

06:07.898 --> 06:11.667
to stop talking about
all this union stuff.

06:11.669 --> 06:13.435
You're not allowed
to restrict my speech.

06:13.437 --> 06:15.070
It's for your own good.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.235
Wow.

06:16.236 --> 06:18.580
So now you've got your muscle
trying to threaten me?

06:18.581 --> 06:20.008
Jonah? The muscle?

06:20.010 --> 06:21.543
I mean... okay.

06:21.545 --> 06:23.312
Seems like a weird thread to pull.

06:23.314 --> 06:24.733
Did everyone hear that?

06:24.734 --> 06:28.055
Amy is now telling me that
I can't even talk about unions.

06:28.319 --> 06:30.340
- No...
- Amy, is that true?

06:30.341 --> 06:32.121
I don't think you're
allowed to do that.

06:32.123 --> 06:34.523
I was just saying
that while she's at work...

06:34.524 --> 06:37.897
This is my work now.
The work of justice.

06:38.195 --> 06:39.928
The only work that matters.

06:39.930 --> 06:42.498
Where are you ge...
is this from a play?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.836
- No.
- Sandra, look.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.251
I get that this is fun.

06:45.536 --> 06:47.520
But corporate is taking this seriously.

06:47.938 --> 06:49.238
You hear that, everyone?

06:49.240 --> 06:51.407
Corporate is taking us seriously.

06:51.409 --> 06:53.137
No! What I mean is that

06:53.138 --> 06:55.411
corporate is viewing this as a threat.

06:55.413 --> 06:57.264
And they view us as a threat!

06:57.265 --> 06:59.214
You maybe want to think
of your phrasing before

06:59.216 --> 07:00.449
so that you don't twist your words...

07:00.451 --> 07:01.583
Yeah. No, I'm getting that,

07:01.585 --> 07:03.152
Wait, what are you doing?

07:03.154 --> 07:05.320
Can you please not get up on the...

07:05.322 --> 07:07.256
- Okay.
- No, if you could just, San...

07:07.258 --> 07:09.909
Management is trying to silence us.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.761
But our voices will be heard.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.497
No, nobody was trying
to silence anybody.

07:15.499 --> 07:16.999
She was somewhat.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.700
- Glenn!
- What? You were.

07:18.702 --> 07:22.510
Well, if we can't talk here
then we will talk elsewhere.

07:22.967 --> 07:26.487
Union meeting, tonight! Location, TBD.

07:26.488 --> 07:30.524
Time, TBD. Refreshments, T-B-D!

07:38.622 --> 07:41.723
I just wonder if a union
will lead to more rules.

07:41.725 --> 07:43.091
Like, what if they start making us

07:43.093 --> 07:44.893
wear gloves when we clean the toilets?

07:44.895 --> 07:46.795
You don't wear gloves
when you clean the toilets?

07:46.797 --> 07:48.797
No way. I need my fingernails

07:48.799 --> 07:50.332
to chip away at the caked-on parts.

07:50.334 --> 07:51.934
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

07:51.936 --> 07:53.223
What are you guys talking about?

07:53.224 --> 07:54.706
- Feces.
- Horses.

07:55.078 --> 07:57.666
- Unions.
- Unions? Huh.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.443
Well, you can't talk in here.
The break room is closed.

08:01.445 --> 08:02.459
Wait, why?

08:03.747 --> 08:05.343
Because of the radon problem.

08:05.344 --> 08:07.749
- Too much or too little?
- I think you know.

08:07.751 --> 08:09.548
But where are we supposed to eat lunch?

08:09.549 --> 08:11.820
That doesn't matter to me
as long as you're not together.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.126
So you don't...
cross-contaminate each other.

08:14.592 --> 08:16.391
Um, just go eat in your
cars or something.

08:16.393 --> 08:17.793
I don't have a car.

08:17.795 --> 08:20.095
Fine, then you can go down
to the sub-basement.

08:20.097 --> 08:22.464
Didn't the building inspector
say there was radon there, too?

08:22.466 --> 08:23.966
Of course he did but truthfully

08:23.968 --> 08:26.301
radon is the least
of your worries down there.

08:26.303 --> 08:28.103
Greetings, shoppers!

08:28.105 --> 08:30.818
Check out our great deals on...

08:31.128 --> 08:32.206
Low battery.

08:34.245 --> 08:36.378
Now I heard they're
having a union meeting?

08:36.380 --> 08:37.467
It's nothing, Jeff.

08:37.469 --> 08:38.881
I swear I've got it under control.

08:38.883 --> 08:39.869
It's too late!

08:39.870 --> 08:41.500
They're making their plans right now.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.472
I mean, yours is one of the
branches they're getting rid of.

08:43.472 --> 08:44.853
What? No!

08:44.855 --> 08:46.630
No, Jeff, no! Wha...

08:46.631 --> 08:49.224
What if I come down there and
I-I-I can talk to them myself?

08:49.226 --> 08:51.660
- It's a five-hour drive!
- Well, then you have

08:51.662 --> 08:54.329
to keep them in that meeting
for five hours, Jeff.

08:54.331 --> 08:55.764
Okay. Well, what if I schedule

08:55.766 --> 08:57.332
a new meeting for five hours from now?

08:57.334 --> 08:59.902
Okay, well, I didn't realize
that was an option.

08:59.904 --> 09:01.703
- Yes, do that.
- Okay, listen.

09:01.705 --> 09:03.906
I can't ask people
to stay all night. So we...

09:03.908 --> 09:06.108
Have I been a koala bear
this whole time?

09:06.110 --> 09:07.676
Yes!

09:07.678 --> 09:09.044
- You're leaving now?
- Yeah.

09:09.046 --> 09:10.646
We have a five-hour drive ahead of us.

09:10.648 --> 09:12.915
Hey, do you think
we'll take 55 over to 72

09:12.917 --> 09:14.883
or shoot up 70 all the way to 57?

09:14.885 --> 09:16.585
- Whatever's faster.
- It's just...

09:16.587 --> 09:18.186
a lot of my anecdotes
are location-dependent.

09:18.188 --> 09:19.922
You don't want to hear
a Litchfield story in Mattoon.

09:19.924 --> 09:21.490
What exactly are you
planning to do once

09:21.492 --> 09:22.824
- you get to corporate?
- I don't know.

09:22.826 --> 09:23.625
I guess we'll figure it out on the way.

09:23.626 --> 09:25.448
Are you sure you don't want
me to come with you?

09:25.449 --> 09:27.596
No, I need you to
go to this union meeting

09:27.598 --> 09:29.131
and just make sure
it doesn't get out of hand.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.033
So now we're infiltrating
meetings and trying to take

09:31.035 --> 09:33.368
down groups from the inside?
That's who we are now?

09:33.370 --> 09:34.803
Oh, anyone can make something

09:34.805 --> 09:36.438
- sound bad if they try.
- Yeah, Jonah.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.040
It's like, are you donating money

09:38.042 --> 09:40.442
to charity or are you
bribing them to help orphans?

09:40.444 --> 09:42.177
That's a pretty terrible analogy.

09:42.179 --> 09:43.845
Jonah, we can discuss this later.

09:43.847 --> 09:46.077
But can you please
just do this, for me?

09:46.891 --> 09:48.257
Thank you.

09:48.259 --> 09:49.625
And don't call
while we're on the drive.

09:49.694 --> 09:51.560
This is kind of me and Amy time, okay?

09:58.108 --> 09:59.900
I'm sorry we had to do this
in the store but it's the end

09:59.901 --> 10:01.990
of little league season
so everywhere was booked.

10:01.991 --> 10:03.947
- Did you try IHOP?
- Yes, it was booked.

10:03.949 --> 10:05.278
The one on Delmar?

10:05.584 --> 10:07.337
It's... it's too late now.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.653
Anyway, I want to introduce

10:09.655 --> 10:11.555
Robin Green from Retail Workers United.

10:11.557 --> 10:14.406
When I googled
"labor organizer St. Louis"

10:14.586 --> 10:16.828
hers was the first name that came up.

10:21.234 --> 10:25.256
So, like Sandra said
I'm with RWU, and I'm here

10:25.257 --> 10:26.376
to talk to you guys about next steps

10:26.377 --> 10:28.137
and answer any questions you may have.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.507
- Yes?
- Yeah, I was just wondering,

10:30.509 --> 10:32.810
How much our dues were gonna be?

10:32.812 --> 10:34.711
Oh, I think we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves.

10:34.713 --> 10:37.514
Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, I just think

10:37.516 --> 10:38.949
it's a little weird that you

10:38.951 --> 10:41.154
won't tell us how much it's gonna cost.

10:41.155 --> 10:42.486
But... go on.

10:42.488 --> 10:44.138
I will get to that.

10:44.590 --> 10:46.690
Why don't we start with an overview

10:46.692 --> 10:49.226
of how the union process works.
The union...

10:49.228 --> 10:50.318
Marcus?

10:51.797 --> 10:54.131
Hey. What are you guys doing here?

10:54.133 --> 10:57.378
- It's a union meeting.
- What are you doing here?

10:58.471 --> 10:59.819
Union meeting.

11:00.145 --> 11:01.738
Why are you in your underwear?

11:02.174 --> 11:03.190
'Cause...

11:03.609 --> 11:05.907
I didn't know what the dress code was.

11:08.147 --> 11:10.347
They weren't thrilled
about staying late

11:10.349 --> 11:12.282
so it's gonna be a tough crowd.

11:12.284 --> 11:13.984
Oh. Okay. Great.

11:13.986 --> 11:16.186
Hey, Amy! Look, it's Chief Saves-a-lot!

11:16.188 --> 11:18.889
- Oh, yeah.
- The original Cloud 9 mascot?

11:18.891 --> 11:20.691
Look he's even got
his cute little piece pipe

11:20.693 --> 11:21.996
with the cloud coming out.

11:21.997 --> 11:23.894
They probably shouldn't still
have that up there.

11:23.896 --> 11:25.362
- Huh.
- Yeah, so...

11:25.364 --> 11:27.097
Claudia Lankow is the person you're

11:27.099 --> 11:29.766
going to want to impress.
SVP of Operations.

11:29.768 --> 11:32.112
She's into dog shows. Breeds pinschers.

11:32.376 --> 11:34.898
- Okay. So I'll work that in?
- Ah!

11:35.174 --> 11:37.007
The first ever issue of
"Stratus Magazine!"

11:37.009 --> 11:40.177
Dina, so sorry, I'm just...
I'm trying to save the branch.

11:40.179 --> 11:41.445
Don't bring me on a safari
and then tell me

11:41.447 --> 11:42.604
not to look at the zebras.

11:42.605 --> 11:44.073
Shoot, look, we've got to get in there.

11:44.074 --> 11:45.983
Are you ready for this?
You can do this.

11:45.985 --> 11:48.423
- Do you really think so?
- I mean, honestly?

11:48.921 --> 11:50.821
It's unlikely.
Once they make a decision,

11:50.823 --> 11:52.156
usually an inertia sets in.

11:52.158 --> 11:54.158
But, nothing to lose!

11:54.160 --> 11:56.693
There are a lot of preconceived notions

11:56.695 --> 11:58.328
of what a union is or isn't,

11:58.330 --> 12:01.198
so I like to start
with a little exercise.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.066
When you think of the word "union,"

12:03.068 --> 12:04.756
what other words come to mind?

12:07.439 --> 12:08.554
- Me?
- Yes.

12:11.754 --> 12:12.709
Um...

12:12.711 --> 12:14.144
Just right off the top of your head.

12:14.146 --> 12:15.855
I say union, you think...

12:16.048 --> 12:17.058
Union.

12:17.142 --> 12:19.142
Okay. Okay, good.

12:19.251 --> 12:22.286
Uh, but we've already
got that one, so...

12:22.288 --> 12:24.254
It's okay, Glenn.
I would've said union, too.

12:24.256 --> 12:26.390
- You don't have to rub it in.
- I wasn't.

12:26.392 --> 12:28.458
- You're such a dick.
- I...

12:28.460 --> 12:30.527
- What else?
- Organized crime.

12:30.529 --> 12:32.896
Crime. Okay, sure.

12:32.898 --> 12:36.667
I guess there is some history
of that in the past.

12:36.669 --> 12:38.635
It also makes me think
of the Haymarket Riots

12:38.637 --> 12:40.240
and all the lives that were lost.

12:40.296 --> 12:42.997
- So, riots.
- Yeah.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.813
All right!

12:43.815 --> 12:45.275
- Laughter.
- Laughter?

12:45.277 --> 12:47.017
Yeah, like a laugh riot.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.546
Oh, okay. So, um...

12:49.548 --> 12:53.317
These should come from union.
It's not like a word chain.

12:53.319 --> 12:54.985
Oh. Okay, pass.

12:54.987 --> 12:57.421
- Benefits.
- Benefits, good.

12:57.423 --> 12:59.423
- Very good.
- Unionization.

12:59.425 --> 13:01.358
Can't say the word.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.726
This isn't Taboo.

13:02.728 --> 13:03.961
- Incest.
- What?

13:03.963 --> 13:06.563
It's taboo in every culture.

13:06.565 --> 13:08.198
- No, it's just...
- No, it is.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.259
And the Bible.

13:10.161 --> 13:11.258
Incest.

13:11.370 --> 13:13.467
Yes! On the board.

13:14.883 --> 13:17.975
Nobody at Store 1217
is talking about unionizing.

13:17.977 --> 13:20.811
It is just one single employee

13:20.813 --> 13:22.312
- who is...
- An idiot.

13:22.314 --> 13:25.474
A total complete idiot
with no redeeming qualities.

13:25.884 --> 13:28.418
Well, I was gonna say "harmless."

13:28.420 --> 13:29.470
She's harmless.

13:29.471 --> 13:32.010
But idiot also works.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.332
Listen, even if

13:33.333 --> 13:37.294
Ms. Kaluiokalani
were to disappear tomorrow...

13:37.296 --> 13:38.929
Ooh! Love that. Keep talking.

13:38.931 --> 13:40.297
Brick and mortar sales are down.

13:40.299 --> 13:42.466
- That's not your fault.
- No, it's not.

13:42.468 --> 13:45.502
You don't blame the breeder,
you blame the handler.

13:45.504 --> 13:46.582
Right, Claudia?

13:46.939 --> 13:48.227
I don't know.

13:48.907 --> 13:50.340
Look, it was down to a coin flip

13:50.342 --> 13:51.942
between you guys
and the Bel-Ridge store.

13:51.944 --> 13:54.511
Oh, well close Bel-Ridge.
They're awful.

13:54.513 --> 13:56.713
Yeah, they have a very bad reputation.

13:56.715 --> 13:58.715
Well, of course you guys
are gonna say that.

13:58.717 --> 14:00.050
No, it's true.

14:00.052 --> 14:01.718
A couple of their employees

14:01.720 --> 14:04.388
actually vandalized our store recently.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.590
Totally unprovoked. Just ugliness.

14:06.592 --> 14:08.158
- Mm-hmm.
- And they're also rude

14:08.160 --> 14:09.626
- to the customers.
- Very rude.

14:09.628 --> 14:10.761
Yeah, they've been known to...

14:10.763 --> 14:12.229
shame overweight children.

14:12.231 --> 14:15.265
And a lot of their employees
smoke while they work

14:15.267 --> 14:18.468
so when you walk in
it's just a haze of smoke.

14:18.470 --> 14:22.272
- It's like Beijing.
- Which is weird, because

14:22.274 --> 14:26.323
a lot of them have outdated
views on Chinese people.

14:30.149 --> 14:33.083
I'm going to be passing out
some union authorization...

14:33.085 --> 14:35.946
- I-I'll do it.
- Sure.

14:36.388 --> 14:38.288
Sandra is going to be passing out

14:38.290 --> 14:40.791
some union authorization cards.

14:40.793 --> 14:41.858
Can I keep mine in my wallet?

14:41.860 --> 14:43.660
Oh, sorry. I should clarify

14:43.662 --> 14:46.897
that filling these out
is actually the first step

14:46.899 --> 14:49.499
in establishing a union.
So after you sign,

14:49.501 --> 14:51.968
I file them with the
National Labor Relations Board.

14:51.970 --> 14:53.403
I'm going to laminate mine.

14:53.405 --> 14:56.807
Uh, no. Again, I do need those back.

14:56.809 --> 14:58.408
But will we ever see them again?

14:58.410 --> 14:59.626
You don't n...

15:01.547 --> 15:03.146
Yes. You will all see

15:03.148 --> 15:05.515
your cards again at some point.
But no one should feel

15:05.517 --> 15:07.784
like they're being coerced
into signing.

15:07.786 --> 15:09.486
I don't think I'm coercing anyone.

15:09.488 --> 15:12.967
No, not consciously.
But your tone was intimidating.

15:13.424 --> 15:15.959
- What is up with you lately?
- Yeah, you used to be

15:15.961 --> 15:18.328
all "rah-rah
unions are awesome" and now

15:18.330 --> 15:20.297
it seems like you don't
even want to do this anymore.

15:20.299 --> 15:21.765
Maybe it was because back then

15:21.767 --> 15:23.300
he wasn't sleeping with the manager.

15:23.302 --> 15:25.402
All: Oh!

15:25.404 --> 15:27.871
- Wait, is that true?
- Yes, because back then

15:27.873 --> 15:29.239
I was the manager.

15:29.241 --> 15:31.468
But I would never cheat on my wife.

15:31.577 --> 15:33.076
And certainly not with Jonah.

15:33.078 --> 15:35.558
I'd do it with her friend Diane.

15:36.749 --> 15:38.648
I'm saying if you are dating the boss,

15:38.650 --> 15:41.852
well then that explains
why you're so anti-labor.

15:41.854 --> 15:43.220
No! That has nothing to do...

15:43.222 --> 15:44.654
Yeah, you can't be pro-labor

15:44.656 --> 15:47.124
when you're having sex
with the boss all the time.

15:47.126 --> 15:48.158
All: Oh!

15:48.160 --> 15:49.693
Guys, I'm not anti-labor, okay?

15:49.695 --> 15:50.909
I'm just saying...

15:52.731 --> 15:54.317
retail is dying.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.000
And we're already being
replaced by machines

15:57.002 --> 15:59.489
that can do our jobs
better and faster than us.

15:59.738 --> 16:03.206
And-and most of us have no education,

16:03.208 --> 16:06.843
no skills, and are
just generally terrible.

16:06.845 --> 16:07.848
No offense.

16:08.211 --> 16:12.649
So maybe we should just be
happy with what we've got.

16:12.651 --> 16:17.532
You know? Because for most of us this
is as good as it's ever gonna get.

16:22.995 --> 16:25.782
That said, I'm generally pro-labor.

16:29.735 --> 16:31.450
Could I take a couple pens?

16:31.451 --> 16:32.527
Sure.

16:38.844 --> 16:40.437
Hello?

16:40.946 --> 16:44.014
Hi, Laurie, it's Claudia and Dan.

16:44.016 --> 16:45.342
And Jeff. Sutton!

16:45.811 --> 16:47.673
- And Jeff.
- Hey, guys!

16:48.076 --> 16:49.687
- What's going on?
- Hi, listen.

16:49.688 --> 16:51.288
We're shutting down one of the stores

16:51.290 --> 16:52.823
in your district, and it's between

16:52.825 --> 16:55.769
Bel-Ridge and Ozark Highlands.
Do you have any thoughts?

16:56.128 --> 16:58.795
That's easy.
I can't stand the manager at...

16:58.797 --> 17:00.764
Oh!

17:00.766 --> 17:02.833
So sorry! Sorry, hi!

17:02.835 --> 17:05.167
Laurie, it's Amy Sosa. I'm here too.

17:05.170 --> 17:08.137
I-I apologize.
I'm just a little bit jittery.

17:08.140 --> 17:11.141
I had five Cokes on my
way over here and, uh,

17:11.143 --> 17:14.944
I've tried to kick the habit
but I just can't seem to do it.

17:14.946 --> 17:18.260
- I'm a Coke fiend.
- That's... fine.

17:18.717 --> 17:20.126
Laurie, you were saying?

17:21.453 --> 17:22.886
Bel-Ridge.

17:22.887 --> 17:24.820
- I would close Bel-Ridge.
- Oh.

17:24.823 --> 17:26.656
Okay, thank you. Very helpful.

17:26.657 --> 17:28.409
Thank you so much, Laurie! Bye!

17:30.996 --> 17:32.822
Well, there you have it.

17:33.432 --> 17:37.400
So going forward do we talk
once a day or twice a day?

17:37.402 --> 17:39.269
Oh, let's just see how it goes.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.757
Great. So should we meet
for breakfast in the morning?

17:42.474 --> 17:45.203
It doesn't look like the
union's going to happen, huh?

17:45.644 --> 17:49.536
Um, I don't know. Maybe not now, but...

17:50.249 --> 17:51.982
hopefully some time down the line.

17:51.984 --> 17:54.751
Yeah. It's too bad.

17:55.220 --> 17:59.270
In my 30 years here, this is
the closest we ever got.

18:01.093 --> 18:03.159
All right, got a long
drive ahead of me.

18:03.161 --> 18:05.634
- See you tomorrow.
- Night, Marcus.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.397
The hand dryers in the
seventh floor ladies room

18:18.399 --> 18:20.566
are deafening.
It's like a jet taking off.

18:21.188 --> 18:23.125
If you're ever at corporate
do yourself a favor.

18:23.126 --> 18:24.709
Did you see those business ladies

18:24.710 --> 18:27.034
who wear skirts and
sneakers at the same time?

18:27.035 --> 18:29.546
No, they change into pumps
at the office.

18:29.547 --> 18:31.913
The sneakers are for running
into the street yelling,

18:31.914 --> 18:32.948
"Taxi!"

18:33.173 --> 18:34.439
Oh.

18:34.469 --> 18:36.079
Oh, can I have one of these pens?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.392
Absolutely not.

18:40.429 --> 18:41.637
These are my pens.

18:48.958 --> 18:51.730
So, how's baby Rose doing?
Any new teeth coming in?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.189
Why, so you can pluck
them out with your pliers?

18:55.043 --> 18:56.649
Stay away from my daughter.

18:56.650 --> 18:58.424
Come on. Look, I do one bad thing?

18:58.425 --> 19:01.067
That doesn't negate all the good
things I've done in my life.

19:01.123 --> 19:02.814
Name one good thing that you've done.

19:02.815 --> 19:04.076
I don't know. A lot of stuff.

19:04.178 --> 19:06.003
I mean, how do you define "good"?

19:06.153 --> 19:07.582
What's a good thing you've done?

19:07.583 --> 19:10.609
I donated one of my kidneys
to a total stranger.

19:10.611 --> 19:12.076
Okay, yeah. All right.

19:12.077 --> 19:14.179
Well, sure. That's good.

19:14.181 --> 19:15.960
I mean you did that, like, anonymously?

19:16.177 --> 19:17.843
Of course, anonymously.

19:18.382 --> 19:22.244
Good people don't need credit
when they do good things.

19:22.526 --> 19:23.548
Well...

19:24.634 --> 19:25.651
Me too.

19:25.673 --> 19:28.854
I've done a lot of anonymous stuff too.

19:28.855 --> 19:29.893
Yeah, right.

19:31.889 --> 19:32.932
Have you?

19:33.937 --> 19:35.558
Shh.

19:36.387 --> 19:38.542
You little devil.

19:46.263 --> 19:49.005
Jerusha, I told the kidney lie again.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.188
And then I had to sit
in the lobby for 20 minutes

19:52.189 --> 19:53.504
while Dina had sex with the waiter

19:53.505 --> 19:54.903
from Michael Jordan's Steak House.

19:55.442 --> 19:57.157
That sounds like quite an adventure.

19:57.521 --> 19:59.083
So, tell me more about the meeting.

19:59.084 --> 20:00.343
I already told you everything.

20:00.344 --> 20:01.171
I did what I could.

20:01.177 --> 20:02.580
No, but like, tell me more.

20:02.581 --> 20:04.919
Like, like, who was the most into it?

20:04.920 --> 20:06.804
What, like you want, like, names?

20:06.805 --> 20:08.606
Yeah. So I can keep an eye on them.

20:09.081 --> 20:10.754
I'm not going to tell you that.

20:10.755 --> 20:13.586
Jonah, why are you being
so weird about this?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.437
Me? You're the one who said

20:15.439 --> 20:17.146
to keep the union thing under control,

20:17.147 --> 20:18.682
and now you want me to give you names?

20:18.683 --> 20:19.517
Who are you?

20:19.518 --> 20:21.457
I'm trying to save
everybody their jobs.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.490
You're trying to save somebody's job.

20:26.402 --> 20:27.543
That's not fair.

20:29.117 --> 20:30.877
I'm sorry. I jus... it just...

20:30.878 --> 20:33.121
There was actually some
momentum to finally

20:33.528 --> 20:35.528
get this thing done an I - I...

20:39.335 --> 20:40.338
I'm sorry.

20:43.297 --> 20:44.343
Welcome back.

20:47.470 --> 20:50.414
And the first ten employees
who sign these cards

20:50.416 --> 20:52.608
get to be a part of "Sandra's Angels."

20:52.610 --> 20:56.360
It's a club that meets at my house
to watch TV and eat sliders.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.449
Hey.

20:58.956 --> 20:59.956
I'm in.

21:01.569 --> 21:02.656
Let's do this

21:05.369 --> 21:06.369
Thank you!

21:07.836 --> 21:09.836
Is your mobile also your home phone?

21:10.156 --> 21:12.802
I need to know if your
mobile's also your home phone!

21:14.715 --> 21:15.715
Johna!
