WEBVTT

00:23.675 --> 00:25.503
Oh, my God.
My quads are broken.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.853
Nothing like punishment sprints
to make your body hate you.

00:27.897 --> 00:31.118
So do we think that, uh,
Sullivan might have accused

00:31.161 --> 00:33.468
Beckett of drinking on the job
as, like, a power play?

00:33.511 --> 00:35.600
Oh, I really don't want to
believe that.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.037
Or he <i>was</i>
drinking on the job, right?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.995
But the pee test
was clean.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.866
- Today.
- You really think?

00:40.910 --> 00:42.651
Beckett's sloppy sometimes.
He's always cranky.

00:42.694 --> 00:45.088
And addicts
know addicts.

00:45.132 --> 00:48.048
Yeah, or Sullivan just wanted
that captain job again.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.706
Oh, boy.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.969
Looks like Bishop is having
a nervous breakdown.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.101
Uh-oh.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.978
Hey, you found us.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.851
I, uh...
need a drink.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.505
Man, you know,
I gotta say it.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.116
This breakup was
a long time coming.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.118
I need three drinks.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.554
Yeah.

01:16.598 --> 01:17.947
Oh, hey.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.127
Hey.
Hey.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.607
Hey.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.087
Are we gonna blackmail
somebody out here?

01:27.130 --> 01:28.740
No.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.264
I-I wanted to meet up
on the roof,

01:30.307 --> 01:32.179
but Beckett's up there, brooding
out into the night, so...

01:32.222 --> 01:34.050
So we're staging a coup.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.706
Ah, trust me. I wanted to after
that crap with t-the sprints.

01:37.749 --> 01:39.577
Yeah, I know. Much too
reminiscent of my childhood

01:39.621 --> 01:41.101
for me to, uh, process that
right now,

01:41.144 --> 01:43.059
but that is not
why we're here.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.280
We -- We just
wanted to, um --

01:46.323 --> 01:51.589
We -- We want to, uh,
ask you,

01:51.633 --> 01:55.158
um, for your...

01:55.202 --> 01:56.986
Sperm. Your sperm.

01:58.770 --> 02:01.121
Do you remember when you
told me you waste a lot of it?

02:01.164 --> 02:03.166
Well, we would like to
take you up on your offer

02:03.210 --> 02:04.472
to be our donor.

02:04.515 --> 02:05.777
What she said.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.997
Okay. Uh...w-what?

02:08.040 --> 02:11.087
We decided that we don't
want it to just be some

02:11.131 --> 02:13.002
random donor
from a catalogue,

02:13.045 --> 02:15.178
that we want it to be somebody
that we know,

02:15.222 --> 02:18.094
and we want you.
Yes.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.661
My -- My sperm.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.097
Yeah.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.187
Andy?
Hey.
Hi.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.015
- Andy? Oh, my God.
- What happened?

02:26.058 --> 02:27.625
I...Andy.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.801
Hey.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.205
S-So, who is this guy?

02:42.249 --> 02:44.164
Um, I'm not sure.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.861
Maddox knew him.
Oh.

02:45.904 --> 02:48.037
- Are you injured?
- Um, I don't think so.
I --

02:48.080 --> 02:49.169
- No. No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Let me see.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.300
- Her body is evidence.
- I just --

02:50.344 --> 02:53.390
I-I-I-I hit him.
I-I fought him off.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.218
Thank God.
Hey, look,
I'm not gonna touch you,

02:55.262 --> 02:57.089
but, Andy,
d-did you hit your head?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.050
You need -- You need to
take the aid car.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.617
Why?

03:02.660 --> 03:04.184
T-T-The guy, he's on the ground.
I hurt him.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.968
He's -- He's --
He was bleeding.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.188
Um...please, go, go.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.146
- Okay, we got it.
- It's -- It's in the parking lot

03:10.190 --> 03:11.278
behind Joe's Bar.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.062
- We got it!
- His name -- His name's Jeremy.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.542
Andy, I'm gonna call
this in to the police

03:14.585 --> 03:16.021
so they can get
a statement from you.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.240
Is that okay with you?

03:27.294 --> 03:29.557
Andy? Can I call
the police for you?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.691
Uh, police, yes.
Call it in.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.910
Andy?

03:34.953 --> 03:36.651
I'm fine. I'm fine.

03:36.694 --> 03:37.782
I'm fine.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.181
Hey, big shot,
how was school?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.313
<i>Hola, mija.</i>

03:47.618 --> 03:49.446
There's food
in the fridge.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.535
Do you have
any homework?

03:52.710 --> 03:55.104
Wait, what is this?

03:55.147 --> 03:56.366
Huh?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.064
Was it that
Thompson kid again?

03:59.108 --> 04:00.501
He tripped me.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.286
Thompson kid. Uh-oh.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.332
Looks like he's got a crush
on you.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.203
Johnny.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.987
Hey, don't say
that to my kid.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.119
What?

04:10.162 --> 04:11.642
He didn't
mean anything by it, Elena.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.209
Yeah, it's just something
they say about kids.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.429
I don't care.
Don't say it to my daughter.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.082
Come on, mija.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.697
You okay, hmm?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.708
You sure she said
Joe's Bar?
Yeah.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.102
Seattle FD!
Anyone need assistance?!

04:37.146 --> 04:38.974
Seattle Fire Department!

04:39.017 --> 04:40.149
- Anyone?
- Jeremy?

04:41.672 --> 04:43.413
I don't know.
Maybe he fled the scene?

04:43.457 --> 04:45.328
Look.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.374
- What?
- It's blood.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.158
Man, don't mess
with Herrera, huh?

04:49.201 --> 04:51.334
Seriously.
So he probably did run.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.422
Coward.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.207
Guys? Hey, over here!

05:00.125 --> 05:02.127
- Here, here.
- Grab the c-collar.

05:02.171 --> 05:04.652
Jeremy?
Jeremy, can you hear me?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.218
Jeremy?

05:07.394 --> 05:09.221
Nothing.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.746
Okay, we have to move him.
There's no room here.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.662
Okay. Let's roll him.
Ready?

05:14.705 --> 05:15.924
Yep.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.753
On three.
One, two, three.

05:20.363 --> 05:21.495
Careful.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.113
- Is it tight?
- Good?

05:31.156 --> 05:32.854
Okay.
Yeah.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.508
Good on your side?
Yeah.

05:34.551 --> 05:35.900
Okay.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.033
Hold on.
I'll tie you in.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.122
Ready?
Yep.

05:40.165 --> 05:42.080
One, two, three.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.082
Keep going, keep going.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.392
I'll start bagging him.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.133
Let's get him hooked up
to the monitor,

05:51.176 --> 05:52.830
start suctioning,
do a quick head-to-toe.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.136
Hughes,
get ready to intubate.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.750
Hands up.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.317
This guy attacked Andy.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.101
We deal with
our feelings later.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.929
You are Andy's friend later.
Right now, you're a paramedic.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.366
I know. I know.
I got it.

06:10.631 --> 06:13.329
God, it's a bloody mess
in here.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.983
Cricoid pressure?

06:16.201 --> 06:17.551
Can you see anything?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.466
Not a chance. It's just --
There's too much damage.

06:19.509 --> 06:23.208
This is just basically gonna
be a blind attempt.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.645
Okay, okay, okay.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.386
- That's not gonna help.
- Sats are
dropping below 80.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.126
He needs
a surgical airway.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.173
You're gonna cric him?

06:31.216 --> 06:33.044
Get ready for more blood.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.611
Alright.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.398
Here.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.140
Got it?
Yep.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.235
Andy's gonna need a lawyer.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.593
Oxygenation is improving.

06:59.636 --> 07:00.855
Let's get him
on a board.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.074
Bishop, what the hell?
Did you call in backup?

07:03.118 --> 07:04.424
No need. We got it.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.687
Traumatic airway
with head injury.

07:06.730 --> 07:07.992
Fluids going
and tubed.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.820
He needs Grey-Sloan.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.083
This guy attacked Andy.
You shouldn't be treating him.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.999
- Why?
- Because he attacked
my ex-wife.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.392
Exactly. None of you
should be treating him.
God.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.220
You're too close
to the situation.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.874
You should have called in
another station immediately.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.919
- I'm calling in backup.
- Yeah, but we're
already here, okay?

07:21.963 --> 07:24.182
So if we don't
move him now --Look, right now,
he has a pulse, okay?

07:24.226 --> 07:26.184
And his sats
are up to 89.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.273
Dispatch, this is
Captain Beckett from Station 19.

07:28.317 --> 07:31.015
We need an additional engine
and aid car to Joe's Bar

07:31.059 --> 07:33.061
for a 35-year-old male victim
of assault.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.019
Send SPD.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.152
Oh, come on.
He's flatlining.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.415
- Oh, prepping epi.
- Starting compressions.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.025
Dispatch, this is
Captain Beckett again.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.027
How long till
backup arrives?

07:43.071 --> 07:44.072
It's getting hard
to bag him.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.813
This is not good.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.205
This is a disaster.
You should have called this in.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.556
This is not good
for Andy.

07:50.948 --> 07:52.820
This guy cannot die.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.999
You say you knew this man.
James, um, last name?

07:58.042 --> 08:00.001
Uh, Jeremy.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.264
I didn't -- I didn't
get his last name.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.614
And no, I didn't
really know him.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.921
We -- We just
met tonight.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.532
He's a friend of
my lieutenant's, Maddox.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.142
John Maddox.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.188
We will need John Maddox'
contact information

08:13.231 --> 08:15.712
and all the names and contact
information of everyone present.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.105
Okay.

08:17.148 --> 08:20.674
Everyone left early,
except for the guy, Jeremy.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.284
He stayed behind
with me.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.199
How long were you both
at the bar?

08:24.242 --> 08:27.158
Uh...late.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.073
Were you drinking?

08:29.117 --> 08:31.032
Yep,
I-I took my team out

08:31.075 --> 08:33.513
because our station
had just been closed down.

08:33.556 --> 08:37.212
We were, you know, celebrating
the station's legacy.

08:37.255 --> 08:39.214
Are you inebriated now?

08:41.085 --> 08:43.000
The attack kind of
sobered me up.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.741
Right, um...

08:44.785 --> 08:46.656
We have to ask
- these questions.
- I know, I know.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.092
You know how it is,
being a paramedic.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.964
Memory, judgment,
and all.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.314
When alcohol is involved,
it's important to note it down.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.012
No, I'm not drunk.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.579
When you say you
fought him off,

08:56.623 --> 08:58.363
were you carrying mace
or a weapon of any kind?

08:58.407 --> 09:01.236
No, there was a struggle.
I hit him, and that's it.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.325
Where did you hit him?

09:03.368 --> 09:06.546
I -- I don't know.
I...

09:06.589 --> 09:10.114
Uh, his -- his throat?

09:10.158 --> 09:11.986
I think I might have
bit his hand.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.248
'Cause you thought
he was going to assault you.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.467
No, because
he <i>did</i> assault me.

09:15.511 --> 09:18.558
Right. I just meant you
thought he was going to...

09:18.601 --> 09:21.256
Rape me? Yes.

09:21.299 --> 09:23.650
So when you got back here,
you told your teammates

09:23.693 --> 09:26.435
to go aid him because
you saw you had inflicted

09:26.478 --> 09:27.958
significant injuries?

09:28.002 --> 09:29.960
Yeah. I mean, he --
he was on the ground.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.049
And then you left him there
and came back to this station.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.921
How did you get here?

09:33.964 --> 09:35.966
I'm...

09:40.492 --> 09:42.625
I don't know.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.192
I don't know.
I --

09:44.235 --> 09:46.237
Seems like some of your
memories are a little hazy.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.022
Why is that?

09:49.066 --> 09:51.242
Um, I-I...

09:51.286 --> 09:54.158
I'm allowed to have
someone here with me, right?

09:54.202 --> 09:56.204
An advocate?

09:56.247 --> 09:57.727
Technically, yeah.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.207
Well, you should have offered
that to me at the start.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.557
I'd like one.
I'd like my friend here with me.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.212
Dr. Ben Warren, please.

10:04.255 --> 10:07.432
You know what your tío said,
it's not true, right?

10:07.476 --> 10:08.999
That's just something
that people say

10:09.043 --> 10:12.133
to make excuses for boys,
and it's not right.

10:12.176 --> 10:15.179
This happens again,
I want you to hit him back.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.006
Elena!

10:16.050 --> 10:17.791
I'm serious, mija.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.967
Did you know that
Uncle Snuffy

10:20.010 --> 10:22.839
is a mixed martial arts
champion?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.624
You think that anyone
messes with him?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.756
- No.
- You bet your ass, no.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.064
You know, one time
I saw him knock this guy out

10:30.107 --> 10:32.457
in one single punch --
Bam!

10:32.501 --> 10:34.111
Your mama's crazy.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.592
Yeah, that'll show
that Thompson brat.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.075
That's it.
That's -- That's all I remember.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.859
Alright, well, we're still
a little blurry

10:42.903 --> 10:45.079
on some of the details,
but if that's all you remember,

10:45.122 --> 10:48.212
Ms. Herrera, we are --Uh, it's --
it's Captain Herrera.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.171
And that's pretty normal
for events like this.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.955
It's the brain's response
to trauma.

10:51.999 --> 10:54.915
O-Of course. We're sorry for
all that you've been through.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.612
Thank you for
your statement.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.354
Can't say it was my pleasure,
but you know what I mean.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.138
Well, we will follow up with you
in a few days.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.575
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Y-You're not done here.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.709
Andy has the option of a
physical evidence recovery kit.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.406
A rape kit?

11:08.450 --> 11:09.494
Yeah.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.931
She wasn't...

11:10.974 --> 11:12.846
Well, she was attacked.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.978
Look, t-there was a struggle,
alright?

11:15.022 --> 11:18.286
There is evidence on her body
that can be collected.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.723
One second.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.290
- Andy.
- I...

11:25.075 --> 11:27.077
It's totally up to you.
Your choice.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.905
I-I really, really
want a shower.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.515
Yeah, I know, Andy.
I know.

11:30.559 --> 11:33.431
But...you know how this looks
to guys like them.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.782
Put yourself in the best
position to be believed.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.088
Well, d-does this mean I have
to go to the hospital?

11:38.132 --> 11:40.047
Usually, yes, but I can
call over to Grey-Sloan

11:40.090 --> 11:42.223
and have them send over a
physical evidence recovery kit.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.441
- I don't know.
- We can do it here.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.095
Or Carina can do it.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.836
As a doctor, I can tell you
it's most important

11:46.880 --> 11:48.055
that you are healthy
and unharmed,

11:48.098 --> 11:49.839
and this exam does
that first and foremost,

11:49.883 --> 11:52.189
but it also increases
the likelihood

11:52.233 --> 11:55.018
of holding perpetrators
accountable.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.065
Okay. But here.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.980
I just --
I-I want to do it here.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.112
Absolutely.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.811
Okay. So you two will have
to stand by to collect the kit

12:04.854 --> 12:06.290
and file it away
at the precinct.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.292
- Yeah, we know.
- Do you?

12:08.336 --> 12:09.772
'Cause without
my intervention,

12:09.816 --> 12:11.121
this step might
have been skipped.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.993
Look, I know this is
standard training for doctors,

12:13.036 --> 12:14.211
but not for us.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.909
Well, you need
new training.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.214
Excuse me.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.611
- Pulse check.
- Still flatlining.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.700
No pulse.
We still need to move him.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.615
No, we wait for 88.
They're two minutes away.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.399
Maybe we could
have waited before.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.618
We don't have time now.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.707
Alright,
prepping another epi.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.187
The guy's gone,
Sullivan.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.536
No, he's not.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.016
It's PD's scene now.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.191
I'm not letting
this guy die.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.497
If he dies,
Andy killed him.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.977
And I'm telling you,
it's best for Andy

12:41.021 --> 12:42.196
if this scene
is preserved.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.284
I'm handing
this scene over.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
I see a beat.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.114
I got a pulse!
I got a pulse!

12:47.157 --> 12:48.811
Okay. Help me get him
on a gurney.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.988
Grey-Sloan is literally
across the street.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.163
Are we doing this?

12:53.207 --> 12:54.817
Come on. Come on!

12:54.861 --> 12:56.123
Okay, screw it.
Screw it, let's do it.

12:56.166 --> 12:57.994
Alright, I'll drive.
I'll drive.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.997
Okay, one, two, three.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.087
- Okay.
- Ready?

13:04.131 --> 13:05.132
Yep.
Got it.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.054
Okay.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.229
Good? Good?

13:15.272 --> 13:17.057
Okay.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.014
Okay.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.452
Moving.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.247
19!

13:45.389 --> 13:46.913
His pulse
is barely there.

13:46.956 --> 13:50.394
Hey, how long does it take
to go around the block, huh?!

13:54.921 --> 13:56.705
Okay, pulling up.
Pulling up.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.228
Come on, come on!

13:58.272 --> 14:00.883
- Let's go!
- Come on, come on,
come on!

14:00.927 --> 14:03.059
35-year-old male
with significant head injury

14:03.103 --> 14:04.713
and a surgical airway.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.106
Arrested in the field,
now with ROSC.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.064
How long
- has he been down?
- Maybe 15.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.239
Pulse came back
three minutes ago.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.458
Alright, got it.
Let me in there.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.894
Thank you.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.158
You have
to keep him alive, alright?

14:15.202 --> 14:16.638
- That's usually the goal.
- No, no.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.379
This guy, he -- he attacked
a friend of ours.
Okay.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.076
And if he dies --They got it, they got it,
Sullivan.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.295
I know, I know.
Don't let him die.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.123
You know what?
Give us some space.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.081
- Okay, Sullivan, come on.
- Why don't you guys
wait in the ambulance bay,

14:25.125 --> 14:26.474
and I will update you.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.998
No, look -- You --
Listen, you don't understand.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.652
Sullivan, stop.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.088
You guys did your job.
Let me do mine, okay?

14:32.132 --> 14:34.134
- It's okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.571
Sully, they got it.
They got it.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.531
You know, I'm not avoiding
the question

14:40.575 --> 14:42.446
you guys asked me earlier,
just so you know.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.971
I know. It's fine.
It's not the time.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.496
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
I can't believe she fought him
off like that.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.590
I mean, I can.
It's -- It's Andy.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.158
But, you know --

14:59.159 --> 15:01.291
Clearly you're not fine.
Did I --

15:01.335 --> 15:03.772
Did I say something to offend
you or upset you or --

15:03.815 --> 15:06.775
I'm not upset.
I'm -- Well...

15:06.818 --> 15:10.953
I am upset, but for Andy,
and I'm trying not to be angry

15:10.997 --> 15:15.175
so I can perform this exam,
but I'm also feeling electric.

15:15.218 --> 15:18.047
I feel like there is
this teenage version of me

15:18.091 --> 15:22.095
that just wants to scream
and cry and dance with Andy,

15:22.138 --> 15:24.097
because she did it.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.577
She hit him back.
She did what I couldn't do.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.840
She did what so many of us
can't do.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.364
She stopped him.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.975
And you didn't.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.281
Stop him.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.981
And I am in awe
and overwhelmed,

15:39.025 --> 15:41.157
and I-I feel like
this teenage version of me

15:41.201 --> 15:45.727
is elated and angry
and -- and relieved.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.295
This is all so much for me
to handle right now,

15:48.338 --> 15:51.733
but talking about it
really helps.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.126
So thank you.

15:53.169 --> 15:57.043
There's also
a teenage version of me

15:57.086 --> 16:00.307
I think knows what
you're talking about.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.831
One who...

16:02.874 --> 16:05.225
you know, froze instead
of fought

16:05.268 --> 16:08.054
or was so scared

16:08.097 --> 16:11.231
that they kind of just wanted
to leave their body.

16:11.274 --> 16:13.624
A-And what Andy did,
I mean, yeah, we should

16:13.668 --> 16:16.105
order her some balloons
or some confetti.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.891
- Hey.
- Uh, Dr. Warren called.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.458
Thank you.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.460
You know what?
I-I'm gonna clear out,

16:23.504 --> 16:25.680
give you guys
some privacy, okay?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.031
You good?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.728
You?

16:32.556 --> 16:34.080
Hi, Jack.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.082
Ah, I'm ready, I guess.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.997
Andy, this is
Dr. Taryn Helm.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.955
She'll be
assisting me today.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.043
- Okay. Thank you.
- Have a seat.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.045
You're very welcome.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.964
Uh, we'd like to start off
by asking for

16:49.008 --> 16:50.618
your consent to
perform this exam.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.054
You don't have
to do all that.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.100
Andy, control was taken
from you tonight.

16:54.143 --> 16:57.668
We would like to
give it back to you.

16:57.712 --> 17:00.410
Okay, uh...
yes, you have my consent.

17:00.454 --> 17:04.023
So this will be a cooperative
and ongoing process.

17:04.066 --> 17:07.069
We'll be asking for your consent
for each section of the test,

17:07.113 --> 17:11.247
and you have the right to agree
or to refuse any part of it.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.770
Okay.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.076
And you can tell us
to stop for any reason,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.512
no questions asked.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.253
No need.
I want this documented.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.343
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.520
The first section is
the collecting of the clothing.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.696
Each item is evidence.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.568
Do you consent?

17:27.611 --> 17:29.135
Yes.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.101
Aah! Stop it!

17:50.156 --> 17:51.070
Is that too tight?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.549
It's good.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.250
Sample sealed.
Doing okay so far?

17:57.293 --> 17:58.729
Yes.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.166
Ready to learn how
to defend yourself?

18:00.209 --> 18:02.255
For the next section,
we will be collecting samples

18:02.298 --> 18:04.126
from under
your fingernails.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.693
Do you consent?

18:05.736 --> 18:08.913
- No, this goes here.
- Yes, you have my consent.

18:08.957 --> 18:12.003
You go for the spots
that are the weakest --

18:12.047 --> 18:15.572
nose, kidney,
groin, throat.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.922
We will now photograph
your injuries.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.185
Do you consent?

18:19.228 --> 18:20.882
Good. Good.
Yes.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.450
If someone attacks you,
you hit and hit,

18:23.493 --> 18:25.582
and you don't stop
until they let go.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.281
Then you run,
and don't look back.

18:28.324 --> 18:31.980
We'll be taking DNA samples
by swabbing areas of your skin.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.155
Do you consent?

18:33.199 --> 18:35.114
Yes, you have
my consent.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.900
Look. Good, good.
That's good.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.207
But you want to follow through.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.471
Imagine your fist
is coming out

18:44.514 --> 18:47.213
the back
of his body, okay?

18:50.477 --> 18:51.565
Good.

18:51.608 --> 18:52.783
And now a blood sample.

18:52.827 --> 18:54.394
- Do you consent?
- That's it.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.178
Yes,
you have my consent.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.920
Good.

18:58.963 --> 19:01.183
There you go.
Good, good.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
Next, we'll be
combing through your hair

19:03.446 --> 19:05.318
and collecting samples.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.710
Do you consent?

19:11.715 --> 19:14.240
Andy, do you want
us to stop?

19:14.283 --> 19:17.504
No, sorry. Yes.
Yes, I consent.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.382
I mean,
it was beyond disastrous.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.254
It was like a dinner
party hosted

19:28.297 --> 19:30.081
by Medea
and the Real Housewives.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.475
Oof.
That does sound bad.

19:32.519 --> 19:33.650
And who were you?

19:33.694 --> 19:35.696
Hm?
What do you mean?

19:35.739 --> 19:37.176
Which housewife?

19:37.219 --> 19:40.179
No, man. I was the child
baked into a pie.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.920
What?
Medea! The myth!

19:42.964 --> 19:45.967
She bakes her children
into a -- Never mind.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.361
The point is,
I was an innocent --

19:48.404 --> 19:50.450
I mean, I'm not
a housewife.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.669
Okay, fine.
I might have called Dixon Sr.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.280
a mediocre company man
and said,

19:54.323 --> 19:56.717
"Even your own son
hates you."
There it is.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.110
I mean, how could
I not say something?

19:59.154 --> 20:00.851
By not saying anything.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.113
No, man.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.941
People like Dixon,
they never get called out

20:03.985 --> 20:05.116
for being scumbags.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.553
They're just failing
their way upwards.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.076
And you thought you were
gonna change all that

20:08.119 --> 20:11.035
by calling out your boyfriend's
father on his birthday?

20:11.079 --> 20:12.646
Ex-boyfriend.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.082
And okay, fine.
I'm Lisa Rinna.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.868
Hey, there he is.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.696
- Here I am.
- Hey, Maddox.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.307
I'm sorry about 23,
man.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.179
Aw, yeah, you seem
really broken up about it.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.963
Well, we're not excited
about having to service

20:26.007 --> 20:27.574
an extra district,
trust me.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.316
Yeah, well, you can thank
her for that one.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.059
I guess, uh, Andy talked
to Chief Ross about

20:35.103 --> 20:38.237
the problems at 23,
and, uh...

20:38.280 --> 20:39.977
then we were closed.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.851
So you think Andy's
the reason 23 closed?

20:43.894 --> 20:45.505
Well, you know
what they say.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.985
If it walks like a duck

20:48.029 --> 20:50.553
and it throws you under the bus
like a duck, then...

20:54.165 --> 20:55.776
Anyway, we're gonna
probably head out

20:55.819 --> 20:58.344
'cause one of us is probably
about to puke, so...

20:58.387 --> 21:00.607
Oh, no.
Please, stay.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.439
I know she's not
the reason we closed.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.528
It's just...

21:08.571 --> 21:12.183
We're pretty tight,
and if she knew this was coming,

21:12.227 --> 21:13.794
it would have been nice
to have gotten a heads up

21:13.837 --> 21:15.012
or something.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.971
Yeah, well, she was the captain,
you know?

21:17.014 --> 21:18.364
That's a hard role
to be in.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.367
Y-You can't talk to your
friends about everything.

21:21.410 --> 21:24.021
Damn. You're right.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.762
I mean,
it's been a while.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.199
I haven't thought about that
part of the job.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.158
"I'm not here
to make friends."

21:31.768 --> 21:33.988
That's me. I'm practicing
my Housewife catchphrase.

21:34.031 --> 21:35.381
That's...

21:37.861 --> 21:39.559
One blood sample
will come with me to be run

21:39.602 --> 21:42.518
at Grey-Sloan, and then
the other will be sealed up

21:42.562 --> 21:44.564
in the kit with
everything else

21:44.607 --> 21:46.435
and handed off to
law enforcement.
Okay.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.829
And everything will
be added to a statement

21:48.872 --> 21:53.050
to support your account
of what happened tonight.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.356
Okay, thank you.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.402
- Take care.
- Thanks.

21:59.013 --> 22:02.190
I feel like my body
is a crime scene.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.235
Oh, I can't imagine
that feels good.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.802
Nope.

22:05.846 --> 22:07.413
But I'm glad
we got the data.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.937
Yeah. Easy to accuse
a woman of lying.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.461
Not so easy to
accuse DNA.

22:12.505 --> 22:13.680
Yep.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.946
I just keep --
I keep replaying it.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.862
I was --
I kissed him.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.081
I -- We were
flirting all night.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.822
I was drinking a lot.

22:25.866 --> 22:28.259
Andy, you can change your mind
at any point.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.000
Even after
flirting or kissing,

22:30.044 --> 22:32.263
even after
you're naked in bed,

22:32.307 --> 22:34.701
consent is an ongoing
negotiation.

22:34.744 --> 22:37.399
It's not a contract
that you're locked into.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.924
That's just false.
It's absolutely false.

22:42.230 --> 22:46.713
The worst part is,
I really liked him.

22:46.756 --> 22:49.106
We were having fun.
It --

22:49.150 --> 22:51.805
He was the kind of person
I could see myself dating, even,

22:51.848 --> 22:53.197
and...

22:53.241 --> 22:55.896
And then a switch flipped
or something.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.071
He -- He changed.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.290
He was a complete
different person.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.728
And now I'm here,
hoping that I --

23:01.771 --> 23:04.644
That I really hurt him.

23:04.687 --> 23:06.123
Is that bad?

23:06.167 --> 23:08.169
Oh, no.
I hope you hurt him, too.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.389
Is there anything
I can do for you?

23:10.432 --> 23:12.173
As a friend
or as a doctor?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.175
Please tell me
I can shower.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.481
You can shower.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.743
Okay.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.138
Thank you.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.406
Okay, Pruitt,
you know what?

23:27.449 --> 23:29.712
Yes, I'm not
mother of the year.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.889
I just want her to know
that she can defend herself.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.283
You know exactly
what happened to me.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.677
I just wish that
I would have had someone

23:37.720 --> 23:40.201
who taught me
this kind of thing.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.466
Pruitt, you accuse me
for not being there for her,

23:44.510 --> 23:47.948
and then you shut me
down when I try to --

23:47.991 --> 23:51.125
No.
No, no, we're not done.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.693
Don't hang up
the phone on me.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.434
Pruitt?

23:55.477 --> 23:57.131
Hello?

23:57.174 --> 23:58.828
God.

24:17.107 --> 24:19.370
What the hell
is going on?

24:19.414 --> 24:20.763
It's been over an hour.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.156
Maybe they took him
into surgery.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.201
He could have
- a brain bleed.
- Oh, God.

24:24.245 --> 24:25.855
Look, we did
everything we could.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.248
It's out of our hands
now.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.206
This is not
gonna look good.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.165
- Legally.
- Or socially.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.254
I mean, any woman knows
they call you a bitch or a tease

24:33.297 --> 24:35.125
before anyone even
knows the details.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.171
Hey, hey. What happened?

24:37.214 --> 24:40.000
He blew a pupil and went into
acute respiratory distress,

24:40.043 --> 24:42.742
lost all oxygenation,
and then his vitals.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.179
Valiant efforts, everyone,
but there --

24:45.222 --> 24:46.572
there just was no way
he was gonna make it.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.008
I'm sorry.

24:55.058 --> 24:56.973
Yes!
Pool shark!

24:57.017 --> 24:58.235
Look who's winning?

24:58.279 --> 25:00.107
How are you beating me?

25:00.150 --> 25:02.588
I think it's 'cause I have
more upper body strength.

25:02.631 --> 25:05.329
Dude, that is not even
a little bit true

25:05.373 --> 25:07.462
or relevant
to any of this.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.551
Yes, thank you.
Another one.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.335
Come on.
No, I cannot do
another one.

25:11.379 --> 25:14.034
A toast.
Well, if it's for
a toast, then...

25:14.077 --> 25:16.515
To the end of 23

25:16.558 --> 25:18.473
and the end of Emmis.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.083
Emmis?

25:20.127 --> 25:21.650
It's what Vic and I used
to call you and Emmett.

25:23.217 --> 25:26.350
Emmett and I used to
call you and Vic "Thicc".

25:26.394 --> 25:28.265
Thicc?

25:35.185 --> 25:36.535
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Thicc!

25:36.578 --> 25:38.841
Speak of the devil!
Yes!

25:38.885 --> 25:40.190
Hello?

25:41.104 --> 25:43.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.

25:43.324 --> 25:45.848
Slow down.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.589
What happened?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.209
Can I help you?

25:59.253 --> 26:02.561
This is Detective Chen.
I'm Detective Berarducci.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.606
We're here to talk to
a Mrs. Andy Herrera.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.390
Captain Andy Herrera.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.349
Right.
Can we speak to her, then?

26:08.392 --> 26:10.612
Two officers already took her
statement from tonight.

26:10.656 --> 26:13.746
We need to speak
with her directly. Please.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.617
You're not from SVU?

26:15.661 --> 26:17.532
Homicide.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.099
Has anybody...
told her yet?

26:19.142 --> 26:20.970
No.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.197
Andy, hey.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.985
The guy, J-Jeremy...

27:14.067 --> 27:16.678
Listen to me, there's a number
for a defense attorney.

27:16.722 --> 27:19.246
Talk to him, okay?

27:19.289 --> 27:21.988
Andy, did you hear
what I said?

27:22.031 --> 27:24.033
Do not talk to the cops.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.252
- Yeah.
- Okay?

27:25.295 --> 27:26.166
Alright.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.480
So you were standing
over his body

27:36.524 --> 27:38.613
and you could tell
that he was in distress.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.702
No, I just -- I ran.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.618
I ran here and told
the Station 19 paramedics,

27:43.662 --> 27:44.967
who responded.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.795
Well, the last report
states you don't remember

27:46.839 --> 27:48.623
- how you got here.
- No, I remember.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.973
I-I ran here because
this is my old station.

27:51.017 --> 27:54.716
And the paramedics,
your friends and ex-husband,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.326
they knew that this person
had assaulted you?

27:56.370 --> 27:58.241
The person that they were
about to medically treat?

27:58.285 --> 28:01.070
Yes, but...they're
professionals.

28:01.114 --> 28:04.160
They would never alter treatment
for something like that.

28:05.945 --> 28:10.689
Look, I-I know I-I don't
have to talk to you.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.778
I've actually been advised
not to talk to you,

28:12.821 --> 28:16.564
but in good faith, I'm here
to help in any way I can.

28:16.607 --> 28:19.088
You're from Precinct 34,
right?

28:19.132 --> 28:21.917
Our teams have worked together
many times.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.397
I'm a firefighter
and a paramedic.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.009
You said yourself,
you saw that he, Jeremy,

28:27.053 --> 28:29.969
was in medical distress
and you ran.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.493
If this is true, why didn't
you call the paramedics

28:32.536 --> 28:34.495
from the parking lot
right away

28:34.538 --> 28:35.975
when you saw
that he was in distress?

28:36.018 --> 28:37.977
I had just
been attacked.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.893
I-I was scared,
and -- and again --

28:40.936 --> 28:43.286
You were still scared after
he was on the ground?

28:43.330 --> 28:45.071
Was he still a danger
to you?

28:45.114 --> 28:48.161
Well, I wasn't gonna stand
around to find out.

28:48.204 --> 28:51.077
But as a paramedic, you knew,
or should have known

28:51.120 --> 28:53.775
the signs of airway closure,
and could have performed

28:53.819 --> 28:56.386
an immediate,
- life-saving procedure, right?
- No, I-I wasn't -- I wasn't a
paramedic in that moment.

28:56.430 --> 28:59.520
I was a woman who
had just been attacked.

28:59.563 --> 29:03.393
I-I defended myself,
and I ran.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.134
That's it.

29:07.615 --> 29:11.662
Uh, am -- am I allowed to have
an advocate here with me?

29:13.273 --> 29:15.492
I'm sorry. No.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.146
Wh--

29:23.152 --> 29:26.199
Because I'm -- Because
I'm not a victim anymore.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.853
Because I'm a suspect.

29:33.119 --> 29:35.164
I am not --
I am not a criminal.

29:35.208 --> 29:38.254
I-I was attacked tonight.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.955
Alright? That's it. I...

29:42.998 --> 29:44.695
No more questions.
No more statements.

29:44.739 --> 29:48.134
If you need more from me,
you can contact my lawyer.

29:48.177 --> 29:50.179
Uh, ma'am,
I wouldn't advise --

29:50.223 --> 29:52.834
It's not "ma'am,"
it's Captain Herrera.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.575
It's just easier to get this
settled without lawyers.

29:54.618 --> 29:57.665
- I said no.
- You heard what she said.
Get the hell out my station.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.972
We still need statements
from the paramedics

30:00.015 --> 30:01.974
who responded
to the scene.

30:02.017 --> 30:06.805
Maya Bishop, Victoria Hughes,
Robert Sullivan, and yourself.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.024
That's fine, but not tonight.
My team's been through enough.

30:09.068 --> 30:10.591
If you want
to interview my team,

30:10.634 --> 30:13.159
put in an official request
with SFD.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.725
Now get out.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.430
Okay, uh,
extra toothbrush.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.867
Not even opened,
and uh, toothpaste.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.869
Thanks for letting me stay.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
I just didn't
want to be alone.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.177
Of course.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.092
Hey, so, uh, you're
Moroccan Mint, right?

30:33.135 --> 30:34.615
Thank you.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.877
- Andy!
- Yo!

30:35.921 --> 30:37.052
- Oh, my God!
- Guys, guys!

30:37.096 --> 30:39.185
We're okay.
Andy, are you alright?

30:39.228 --> 30:41.100
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright?

30:41.143 --> 30:44.146
I-I-I'm okay. I'm --
Are -- Are -- Are you okay?

30:44.190 --> 30:45.974
I'm good.100%.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.236
I'm good. He's drunk.
He's drunk.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.021
You guys, you smell like
a liquor store fire.

30:49.064 --> 30:50.718
- We smell? <i>You</i> smell.
- Hi. Hi, baby.

30:50.761 --> 30:51.980
You're the one
that smells.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.677
Hey, hey. Volume.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.114
Yeah, shh.
I'm drunk.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.246
I...I'm sorry.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.161
- I'm sorry I left.
- No.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.946
You know, if I were there,
you know, I could have --

31:00.989 --> 31:02.817
I would have...

31:02.861 --> 31:04.950
Yeah.
Mm!

31:04.993 --> 31:07.039
Okay, clearly, she didn't need
you as backup.

31:07.082 --> 31:08.214
No, Andy,
seriously, me too.

31:08.257 --> 31:10.042
I would have been like
come here!

31:10.085 --> 31:12.174
Yeah, get him! Get him!

31:12.218 --> 31:14.089
Okay. Guys, guys, guys.
Not the time.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.917
This is not what
- Andy needs right now.
- No, no. For real.
No, no, no.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.049
I would have
drop-kicked his ass.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.877
Yeah.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.704
I would have been right there
beside him!

31:22.271 --> 31:24.578
I think this is exactly
what she needs right now.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.886
Get him. Get him.
Get him.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.323
Oh, my God!

31:30.366 --> 31:31.759
What is that move?

31:31.802 --> 31:33.152
Done.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.067
I shouldn't be laughing.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.069
I-It's not funny.
It's not funny.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.027
It's not --

31:39.071 --> 31:41.943
It's not funny.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.157
Is she okay?

32:22.201 --> 32:25.552
Uh, not really, no.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.482
Come on!

33:27.135 --> 33:28.615
No, stop it!

33:43.717 --> 33:47.416
Please don't ask me
if I'm okay.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.592
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

33:49.636 --> 33:52.726
I've seen what you can do
to a windpipe.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.293
My mother was the one
who insisted

33:54.336 --> 33:56.991
that I take
self-defense classes.

33:58.079 --> 34:00.429
Nothing official,
just...

34:02.127 --> 34:06.609
Snuffy would teach me
every day after school.

34:06.653 --> 34:11.092
Like, for years, up until
I graduated high school.

34:11.136 --> 34:14.095
I'm glad she did.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.315
Who knows what
would have happened

34:16.358 --> 34:19.579
if you didn't have
that muscle memory.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.540
Mom?

34:29.763 --> 34:32.722
Life isn't fair, mija.

34:32.766 --> 34:35.073
You should know that
by now.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.075
You'll figure it out
eventually.

34:39.294 --> 34:42.123
You keep learning from
Uncle Snuffy, okay?

34:42.167 --> 34:43.690
Okay.

34:43.733 --> 34:46.954
Promise me that
you'll get really good at it

34:46.997 --> 34:49.391
and really strong.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.221
Look at me.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.791
Promise.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.142
I promise.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.971
Good.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.105
I think something
happened to her.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.368
Like an assault
or something.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.548
She taught me
to hit the guy back,

35:15.591 --> 35:19.595
because maybe sh--
maybe she couldn't.

35:22.032 --> 35:26.385
If you could do it over,
would you do it differently?

35:29.736 --> 35:31.216
No.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.783
Good.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.786
Because he's the bad guy.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.048
You're not.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.053
He's the bad guy.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.162
Okay, true, technically,
I did offer first,

36:04.205 --> 36:05.772
but you know me.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.339
I-I say things all the time
without thinking.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.036
And then you asked, you know,
officially asked,

36:09.079 --> 36:10.777
and it became real.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.214
And this thing with Andy,
you know, i-it made me think.

36:13.258 --> 36:16.783
You know, my childhood was hard
a-and full of loneliness

36:16.826 --> 36:19.438
and pain, and, you know,
t-to help make a life?

36:19.481 --> 36:21.091
You know, a little me
out in the world?

36:21.135 --> 36:23.311
How could you do that
and not want to b-be there

36:23.355 --> 36:27.097
to -- to protect them and --
and teach them and, you know,

36:27.141 --> 36:30.492
leave them some kind of legacy?

36:32.146 --> 36:34.627
I'm not saying that
that's what you want.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.846
I'm just saying that, you know,
i-it'd be hard for me to,

36:36.890 --> 36:38.283
like, compartmentalize.

36:38.326 --> 36:41.155
I read this article, right,
about how, you know,

36:41.199 --> 36:43.940
compartmentalization is key
for these kind of things.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.160
Yes, I read articles.
Thank you.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.075
I'm just saying, I'm not sure I
could separate myself, you know?

36:48.118 --> 36:51.687
I'd want to be involved.
Especially after last night.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.123
We don't want
compartmentalization.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.082
We don't want you
- on the sidelines.
- No.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.650
No, we want -- we want this
to be someone we know

36:57.693 --> 37:01.175
because we do want the donor
in the baby's life.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.307
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:02.350 --> 37:05.223
So I'd be like...
Uncle Jack?

37:05.266 --> 37:08.182
Yes, and they would know
who their donor is.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.402
I mean, you'd have
a special bond.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.969
Maybe I can teach them
to roll hoses and stuff?

37:13.013 --> 37:14.928
Sure, when
they're a teenager.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.930
Or, you know,
like 5 or 6.

37:16.973 --> 37:18.105
Okay.

37:23.153 --> 37:26.200
Is -- Is that a yes?

37:30.030 --> 37:31.510
I think so. Yes.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.642
Are you sure?
Mm.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.876
Look, last night,
it was my call to make,

37:49.919 --> 37:54.184
so if you want to write me up,
just do it.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.970
This is much bigger than
me writing you up, Sullivan.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.364
You openly defied
my leadership by challenging

37:59.407 --> 38:02.497
my integrity in front
of my team and my chief,

38:02.541 --> 38:04.934
and you openly defied
my orders last night.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.807
I am your captain,
so when you challenge me,

38:07.850 --> 38:09.417
you're fracturing the team
and you're putting

38:09.461 --> 38:11.376
everyone else at risk.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.160
Oh, come on.

38:13.203 --> 38:15.858
This is not about safety,
and you know it.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.599
This is about
you and me.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.688
You really want to have
a pissing contest with me?

38:19.732 --> 38:21.516
- Is that what we're doing?
- It's not really a contest

38:21.560 --> 38:24.040
when one person has the power
to transfer the other.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.955
Transfer me, then.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.958
Nah, it wouldn't look good
if I'm gonna pursue a lawsuit.

38:30.177 --> 38:32.048
You're gonna sue me?
For what?

38:32.092 --> 38:33.398
Harassment.

38:33.441 --> 38:34.877
- Okay.
- Slander. Collusion.

38:34.921 --> 38:37.097
Could be a knock-down,
drag-out kind of deal.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.708
Ah, this is how
you guys fail up.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.580
Maybe I'll just make
a little media circus

38:41.623 --> 38:44.017
around your
illegitimate promotion.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.627
I know you like the spotlight,
Fire Zaddy.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.021
It wouldn't look good for Ross,
would it?

38:48.064 --> 38:51.024
Sabotaging the career of
the first female fire chief?

38:56.159 --> 38:58.858
What?
Go ahead, hit me.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.512
I know you want to.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.296
Assaulting a commanding officer
would fit really nicely

39:02.340 --> 39:05.125
with stolen narcotics
charges.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.388
Did you know I was
a Marine?

39:07.432 --> 39:08.998
Scout sniper.

39:09.042 --> 39:13.046
I could sit and wait
for my mark to relax,

39:13.089 --> 39:15.135
let their guard down.

39:15.178 --> 39:16.658
Sometimes it would
take hours.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.181
Sometimes weeks, months.

39:18.225 --> 39:19.792
I learned how to read
a man from 100 yards away,

39:19.835 --> 39:21.489
and I could tell by the way
he moved his shoulders

39:21.533 --> 39:25.580
or -- or cleared his throat
if it was time.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.759
I'm saying, I'm the most
patient man you will ever meet,

39:30.803 --> 39:33.545
and I don't ever lose.

39:33.588 --> 39:37.200
May be worth considering...

39:37.244 --> 39:40.203
before you make
your next move.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.045
Man, I need
a pot of coffee.

39:56.089 --> 39:58.874
Yeah, I bet you do.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.789
How much did you guys
actually drink last night?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.617
- We drank all of it.
- Uh, too much. Too much.

40:02.661 --> 40:03.923
You dummies.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.666
You okay?

40:07.709 --> 40:10.843
Yeah, I just can't stop thinking
if I had just stayed --

40:10.886 --> 40:12.671
Why did I leave her
with that guy, you know?

40:12.714 --> 40:14.020
If I were there,
maybe --

40:14.063 --> 40:15.891
No, you cannot play that
hypothetical game.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.458
Man, it'll wreck you.

40:17.502 --> 40:18.807
And I get that you feel guilty,

40:18.851 --> 40:20.461
but, you know,
Andy handled herself.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.115
She didn't need saving
last night,

40:22.158 --> 40:24.030
and she doesn't
need saving now.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.424
What she needs is a friend,
and we can be that for her.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.556
And pancakes.
She needs pancakes, right?

40:28.600 --> 40:30.428
What are you guys
smiling about?

40:30.471 --> 40:32.473
Nothing. Um...

40:32.517 --> 40:34.127
just excited
for diner food.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.520
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, are we going
to the one on Oak?

40:35.563 --> 40:36.956
No, we're going to
the one on Mills,

40:36.999 --> 40:38.479
'cause they have
better bacon.

40:38.523 --> 40:40.699
Mm.
Ooh, see,
I-I was gonna go home,

40:40.742 --> 40:42.222
but now I think I need
that bacon.

40:42.265 --> 40:44.311
So, where are we going?

40:44.354 --> 40:45.704
Mills.
Oak Street.

40:45.747 --> 40:46.879
Still deciding.

40:46.922 --> 40:48.707
Decide quieter,
please.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.143
- Wait, did you say bacon?
- Oh, yeah.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.536
What are you
doing back here?

40:51.579 --> 40:52.841
Andrea Herrera,
we have been issued

40:52.885 --> 40:54.016
a warrant for your arrest.

40:54.060 --> 40:55.322
- Her what?
- Wait. What?

40:55.365 --> 40:56.802
What are you
talking about?

40:56.845 --> 40:58.804
We know you've been
through a lot.

40:58.847 --> 41:00.806
We aren't gonna cuff
you, but you do need to
come down the station.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.373
- She was attacked.
- Okay, we're gonna call your
lawyer. It's gonna be okay.

41:03.417 --> 41:05.027
It was self-defense.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.987
And I'm sure the judge will see
it that way, but right now,

41:08.030 --> 41:09.336
we need to do due process.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.294
- Oh, due process, my ass.
- It's okay.

41:11.338 --> 41:14.036
It's okay. Guys, it's okay.
- It's okay, I'll go.
- Andy, Andy.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.864
- Andy.
- It's okay. It's okay.

41:22.218 --> 41:26.396
Andrea Herrera, you
have the right to remain silent.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.269
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.
