Tom this is
ground control, over.

00:37.546 --> 00:40.987
Hearing you
loud and clear, over.

00:42.355 --> 00:44.359
We're picking up some
unusual readings down here.

00:44.394 --> 00:47.365
Can you check your
radiation levels?

00:49.137 --> 00:52.143
I'm suddenly detecting
extremely high degrees.

00:52.175 --> 00:53.344
Please advise.

01:01.461 --> 01:05.035
Tom from ground
control do you copy?

01:05.069 --> 01:07.540
Ground control come in.

01:07.573 --> 01:09.342
Do you read me, over.

Come on, come on.

03:58.715 --> 03:59.717
Jane, Jane.

04:14.013 --> 04:17.619
Breathe.

04:19.223 --> 04:20.659
Breathe, breathe.

05:31.334 --> 05:32.570
A latte.

05:32.604 --> 05:33.738
Latte lovely, do you

05:33.771 --> 05:34.773

05:40.453 --> 05:41.989
Yeah that's alright,

05:45.496 --> 05:49.270
- Heatherfield really?
- Yeah, you know it?

05:49.303 --> 05:51.508
Yeah, yeah my parents
are out that way.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.144
Why Heatherfield?

05:53.177 --> 05:55.215
I'm here to see
some relatives.

05:55.248 --> 05:56.652
Oh nice.

05:56.685 --> 05:59.089
Plus I think I could do
with a bit of peace and quiet.

05:59.123 --> 06:01.962
I can't handle
another late night.

06:05.302 --> 06:07.139
So what can I get you?

06:07.172 --> 06:10.680

06:13.151 --> 06:15.456
You need a full
English breakfast.

06:15.489 --> 06:17.627
Trust me, a fry up is the
best thing I could do.

06:17.660 --> 06:21.867

can't beat a good old fry up.

06:21.901 --> 06:23.472
Okay we'll take four of them.

Yeah?

06:24.907 --> 06:26.578

06:28.147 --> 06:29.216
Full works.

06:33.992 --> 06:35.763

06:35.796 --> 06:37.800
Make it slow taste will you?

06:37.834 --> 06:39.002

06:48.389 --> 06:50.058
- Are there beans in this?
- I don't know...

06:50.091 --> 06:51.327
I don't like beans.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.866
- Me too.
- They make you fart.

06:57.205 --> 06:59.009
Did she give you her number?

06:59.042 --> 07:01.347
No it's the way

07:01.381 --> 07:02.450
- Oh.

07:03.852 --> 07:05.790
You know you don't have
to come with me right?

07:05.823 --> 07:06.991
I can meet you back
here in a few days.

07:07.025 --> 07:08.194
No we all came to
England to support you

07:08.227 --> 07:11.435

Big gasp.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.363
- Thank you.
- Okay.

07:33.277 --> 07:34.681
Hey Nicole.

07:34.714 --> 07:36.551
Are you at work?

07:36.585 --> 07:37.587
Okay.

07:38.388 --> 07:39.924
Yeah I'm shattered.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.930
You know I need the money.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.836
Oh yeah yeah yeah,

07:45.870 --> 07:48.374

07:48.408 --> 07:49.911
Yeah it'll be nice
to see you all.

07:49.944 --> 07:52.282
Jim I really think it's
gonna be great for you

07:52.315 --> 07:56.525
to finally meet them
especially after everything.

07:56.558 --> 08:00.365
Yeah man in all seriousness
I'm happy to be here with you.

08:00.399 --> 08:02.937
- Well cheers to that.
- Thanks.

08:04.574 --> 08:05.576
Okay.

08:07.647 --> 08:08.949
It falls apart.

08:13.157 --> 08:15.194
Excuse me what's this?

08:15.228 --> 08:16.565
Black pudding.

08:16.598 --> 08:17.833
What's in it?

08:18.969 --> 08:20.873
Pig's blood.

08:24.012 --> 08:26.083
Ah it's not bad.

08:26.116 --> 08:28.087
- I don't want it.
- Oh my god that's disgusting.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.924
Come here.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.664
That is gross.

08:33.698 --> 08:36.837
I will eat you also.

08:36.871 --> 08:39.042
Ooh what's that?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.313
Ooh what's that?

09:07.032 --> 09:09.269
Do they
have earthquakes here?

09:09.302 --> 09:10.873
Oh god run!

09:19.322 --> 09:21.861
Guys you need to move.

09:23.197 --> 09:27.372
What was that?

09:28.742 --> 09:30.879
Guy, guys you
need to move quick.

09:30.913 --> 09:32.817
Move away from the windows now.

09:32.850 --> 09:35.155
Just move, move, come on.

09:35.189 --> 09:36.524
Go go go go.

09:36.558 --> 09:38.395
Come on, come on.

09:38.428 --> 09:39.430
Come on.

09:40.331 --> 09:41.735
Come on, come on.

09:54.359 --> 09:57.165
Do your phones have news?

09:57.199 --> 09:59.537
- Is everyone okay?
- Yep.

10:10.259 --> 10:13.598
- Everyone...
- What's going on out there?

10:14.534 --> 10:16.738
- Did you see anything?
- I...

10:16.771 --> 10:18.508
What's outside?

10:18.542 --> 10:19.777
Is it terrorists or something?

10:19.811 --> 10:21.548
- I don't know.
- Shut up.

10:21.581 --> 10:22.883
What, I don't...

10:50.339 --> 10:52.376
Maybe she's shaken.

10:52.409 --> 10:54.714
We need some water.

10:54.747 --> 10:55.749
Okay.

10:59.624 --> 11:01.226
It's okay.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.030
- Quick.
- She's really shaken.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.232
Thank you.

11:04.267 --> 11:07.740
Alright take some
of this for us now.

11:07.773 --> 11:08.775
Just a sip.

11:12.816 --> 11:14.320
Well done.

11:14.353 --> 11:15.355
Hey.

11:16.524 --> 11:18.027
It's okay darling.

11:18.962 --> 11:20.832
It's okay sweetheart.

11:20.866 --> 11:22.803
Come on Grace.

11:25.842 --> 11:26.978
It's gonna be okay,

11:27.011 --> 11:30.420
it's fine, it's
fine, she's in shock.

11:30.485 --> 11:32.589
Can't get reception.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.941
Dude I can't see
anything, it's just people.

11:41.975 --> 11:43.412
I don't know what to do.

11:43.446 --> 11:44.313
It's gonna be
okay, it's gonna be okay.

11:44.347 --> 11:46.149
She's in shock, it's okay.

11:48.321 --> 11:52.464
Hey guys, guys quick
there's something on the news.

11:52.496 --> 11:55.335
I don't think
I should leave her.

11:55.369 --> 11:56.804
She'll be fine.

11:56.838 --> 11:58.107
The greater
London metropolitan area.

11:58.140 --> 12:00.480
While those services are
struggling to respond

12:00.512 --> 12:02.015
governmental authorities caution

12:02.048 --> 12:04.454
to avoid all areas of impact.

12:04.488 --> 12:07.926
Reports around the world
including the United States

12:07.960 --> 12:10.632
have similar claims of
people getting sick.

12:12.369 --> 12:13.170
Grace?

12:13.203 --> 12:14.205
Help!

12:14.239 --> 12:16.512
- You guys I need help.
- Benny.

12:17.679 --> 12:18.948
Out of the way,
out of the way.

12:20.051 --> 12:21.388
Turn her around.

12:22.823 --> 12:25.796
Turn her over, turn
her over, Grace, Grace.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.332
Jeez.

12:27.366 --> 12:29.637
Turn her on her side.

12:29.670 --> 12:32.342
- Whoa whoa.
- Such aggression.

12:35.682 --> 12:36.651
Give me the keys,
give me the keys!

12:36.684 --> 12:38.389
What are you doing?

12:38.422 --> 12:39.690
We can't
let anyone else in.

12:39.723 --> 12:41.694
Dude just let her
in she needs help.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.163
Whatever that is
it's making them sick.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.836
Well of
course they're sick.

12:45.869 --> 12:47.474
- They're not just sick.
- Oh god.

12:47.507 --> 12:51.346
They're not just
sick, give me the keys.

13:37.773 --> 13:38.841
She's dead.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.448
What are we gonna do now?

13:41.481 --> 13:42.950
We stay put.

13:42.983 --> 13:45.054
Whatever happened,
it happened outside.

13:45.087 --> 13:48.761
Then why did she
bite it in here?

13:48.795 --> 13:51.132
No one else gets in.

14:13.010 --> 14:15.815
(panting heavily

15:12.530 --> 15:13.898
Look my car's near by.

15:13.931 --> 15:15.334
We can get you some help
okay, we'll go get some help.

15:15.367 --> 15:17.037
I need some water.

15:19.677 --> 15:20.880
- He's got it.
- Got what?

15:20.912 --> 15:21.848
- What?
- He's got it.

15:21.882 --> 15:22.550
- Got what?
- What?

15:22.583 --> 15:23.852
Pete.

15:28.026 --> 15:28.829
What're you doing?

15:28.862 --> 15:29.864
Stay back.

15:30.733 --> 15:31.568
Please.

15:31.601 --> 15:33.605
You need to leave now.

15:35.174 --> 15:37.914
Just leave.

15:37.946 --> 15:39.918
Pete!

15:39.950 --> 15:42.857
Christ, okay let's
go, let's go, everybody.

15:42.890 --> 15:44.125
Pete.

15:46.631 --> 15:47.966
Come on.

16:24.841 --> 16:25.843
Which way?

16:27.947 --> 16:29.115
Where is it?

16:29.148 --> 16:31.020
I'm just thinking
about the best way okay.

16:31.085 --> 16:33.457
- This way, okay.
- Are you sure?

16:33.491 --> 16:34.727
- I think so.
- You think?

16:34.761 --> 16:36.362
- You think?
- Yes.

16:49.088 --> 16:50.926
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

16:52.462 --> 16:54.231
Hey, hey.

16:57.807 --> 16:59.009
Go go go.

17:50.343 --> 17:54.152
- Which one's yours?
- The one at the back.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.114
Go go.

18:52.035 --> 18:53.404
She has a baby.

18:59.416 --> 19:00.886
We gotta save it.

19:01.754 --> 19:04.259
It doesn't even look alive.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.312
Is it infected?

19:15.314 --> 19:16.918
Is it?

19:16.951 --> 19:19.389
I think it moved.

19:19.422 --> 19:21.059
We need to leave.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.069
There's no way we're
leaving her with that baby.

19:26.103 --> 19:27.605
She's right.

19:27.639 --> 19:30.144
We can't leave without it.

19:35.923 --> 19:36.925
Go.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.665
Go!

20:09.122 --> 20:10.792
Astrophysicists are reporting

20:10.826 --> 20:14.099
that intense electro
magnetic storms on the sun

20:14.132 --> 20:16.603
have triggered deep fissures
and enormous eruptions

20:16.636 --> 20:20.544
violently blasting
solar matter into space.

20:20.578 --> 20:22.181
Thousands of times more powerful

20:22.215 --> 20:25.254
than has ever been detected.

20:25.287 --> 20:28.127
The solar debris has pierced
the Earth's magnetic field

20:28.160 --> 20:32.635
and ozone layer and caused
widespread destruction.

20:32.668 --> 20:35.274
Human exposure to the vast
amounts of solar radiation

20:35.307 --> 20:39.315
has resulted in alarming
DNA cellular mutations.

20:40.819 --> 20:42.655
Response by the police and
military around the world

20:42.688 --> 20:45.628
have been dissipating as the
effects of the radioactivity

20:45.661 --> 20:50.171
have been spreading beyond
any conceivable rate.

20:50.204 --> 20:53.511
It's imperative to avoid
all human interaction

20:53.545 --> 20:56.817
including physical contact
with friends or family members

20:56.851 --> 20:59.656
who might of been contaminated.

20:59.689 --> 21:03.063
Symptoms include
dark bloodshot eyes,

21:03.097 --> 21:07.138
protruding veins, unusually
aggressive behavior

21:07.171 --> 21:09.477
and an insatiable
craving to attack

21:09.510 --> 21:11.813
and feed on other people.

21:19.062 --> 21:21.032
I don't have a spare.

21:29.315 --> 21:31.387
Look clearly nobody wants to
talk about what's happening.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.157
Yeah I don't want
to talk about it.

21:33.190 --> 21:34.994
We all saw what happened.

21:37.064 --> 21:40.572
Gabe!

21:40.605 --> 21:43.243
Get out, get out, get out!

21:49.789 --> 21:52.930
Hey, hey.

22:29.503 --> 22:33.678
- So what are we gonna do now?
- We keep going, on foot.

22:35.448 --> 22:36.916
But where?

22:36.951 --> 22:38.755
Okay well let's just start
by getting out of London.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.924
Okay let's go to the airport.

22:40.959 --> 22:43.330
I don't know, it could
be full of infected people.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.169
- Well where are we gonna go?
- I don't know.

22:46.202 --> 22:48.073
Dude she's right okay.

22:48.106 --> 22:49.275
Let's just get out of the city.

22:49.309 --> 22:53.618
We can figure out what
we're doing after that.

22:53.651 --> 22:57.325
Do you think we'll
ever make it back home?

22:59.829 --> 23:03.370
What do you think
is going on back home?

23:03.404 --> 23:04.506
Same thing.

23:06.544 --> 23:07.546
What?

23:08.548 --> 23:11.152
It's on the news,
we were hit too.

23:18.066 --> 23:20.605
She didn't need
to know about it.

24:06.430 --> 24:08.033
Guys come on.

24:08.066 --> 24:11.707
- Benny come on.
- Not my running shoes.

25:09.456 --> 25:11.427
Come on now, come on.

25:25.421 --> 25:26.957
- Guys?
- Guys?

26:36.497 --> 26:40.671
We gotta find them.

26:42.208 --> 26:43.677
Where are they?

26:43.711 --> 26:45.414
God damn it.

26:45.448 --> 26:47.585
We blew it guys.

26:47.619 --> 26:48.888
No we didn't.

26:48.921 --> 26:50.157
Alright guys.

26:50.191 --> 26:51.393
Come this way okay, okay?

27:01.647 --> 27:02.649
Jim.

27:03.551 --> 27:05.288
I'm glad you're okay.

27:31.607 --> 27:33.611
Guys guys guys
we gotta go go go.

27:33.644 --> 27:35.146
Come on, come on, come on.

27:37.886 --> 27:39.289
Go go go.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.162
Oh god, go go go, go.

27:45.768 --> 27:46.770
- No.
- Gabe!

27:49.743 --> 27:51.313
- Let go.
- Gabe!

27:51.346 --> 27:54.118
Get him out, get him out.

28:03.002 --> 28:04.204
Are you okay?

28:05.206 --> 28:06.310
Are you okay?

28:07.512 --> 28:08.781
I'm okay.

28:54.204 --> 28:55.875
We gotta go back in.

28:57.044 --> 28:58.515
I'm not
going back in there.

28:58.547 --> 29:00.283
Well you really
want to stay on this roof?

29:09.034 --> 29:11.474
Hey guys, this is good.

29:11.507 --> 29:13.209
We gotta go back in.

29:50.784 --> 29:53.022
They're still out there.

30:23.784 --> 30:26.021
It's gonna get dark soon.

30:27.157 --> 30:29.729
We should probably
stay the night.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.561
You okay?

32:10.565 --> 32:11.567
Yeah.

32:12.903 --> 32:13.905
Are you?

32:14.907 --> 32:15.909
I'm okay.

32:19.683 --> 32:22.220
You trying to contact someone?

32:22.253 --> 32:24.090
I have done.

32:24.124 --> 32:26.564
My mom, my dad and my sister.

32:27.899 --> 32:30.772
I'm really worried
about my sister.

32:36.315 --> 32:40.491
Well if she's anything like
you I'm sure she'll be fine.

32:41.894 --> 32:43.463
Whereabouts is she?

32:44.700 --> 32:47.538
She works in the
hospital near by.

32:52.716 --> 32:57.726
What about you, have you
tried to contact anyone?

32:57.759 --> 32:58.761
- No.
- No?

33:06.241 --> 33:09.314
My sister died
about a month ago.

33:09.347 --> 33:10.349
Sorry.

33:12.923 --> 33:14.425
Our parents died
when we were young

33:14.458 --> 33:17.297
so it was always
just us you know?

33:19.435 --> 33:21.472
And then about a year ago

33:22.842 --> 33:25.949
she finds these guys
in Heatherfield.

33:27.619 --> 33:31.627
And she'd always wanted
to come over and see it.

33:33.128 --> 33:34.633
We'll get there.

33:35.668 --> 33:36.670
I promise.

33:41.278 --> 33:44.150
You said your sister
was in the hospital right?

33:44.184 --> 33:45.186
Yeah.

33:46.957 --> 33:49.294
Then we'll go there first.

33:50.363 --> 33:51.365
Thank you.

33:53.971 --> 33:54.973
Thank you.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.619
Run run.

35:04.612 --> 35:06.215
Move.

36:04.398 --> 36:05.400
Come on.

36:19.028 --> 36:20.430
Gabe it's okay.

36:20.463 --> 36:21.934
Okay Gabe?

36:41.272 --> 36:42.774
But we gotta go.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.404
Guys fire escape.

37:17.177 --> 37:21.652
Come on, you're
okay, come on, come on.

37:21.685 --> 37:22.687
Come on.

37:33.743 --> 37:34.745
Gabe.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.196
Gabe, come on buddy.

37:45.033 --> 37:46.669
We gotta go.

37:46.702 --> 37:50.076
Come on you're okay, you're
okay, come on, you got it buddy.

37:50.110 --> 37:54.284
You got it, you got it, you
got it, come on, come on.

37:55.421 --> 37:56.689
Gabe come on.

37:56.722 --> 37:59.661
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe
you've got this.

38:00.531 --> 38:01.867
Whoa jeez, Gabe.

38:02.935 --> 38:05.875
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe
listen, listen to me.

38:05.908 --> 38:06.910
Gabe, guys!

38:13.689 --> 38:15.193
Get back, Gabe, Gabe.

38:17.965 --> 38:18.967
Gabe?

38:21.973 --> 38:23.544
Gabe?

38:23.577 --> 38:24.612
Gabe wake up.

38:25.548 --> 38:26.550
Gabe!

38:29.321 --> 38:32.794
I'm sorry.

38:32.827 --> 38:36.903
I am so sorry.

39:16.315 --> 39:17.485
I don't like it.

39:17.518 --> 39:18.919
It's a little quiet
don't you think?

39:18.954 --> 39:20.591
Where is everyone?

39:20.624 --> 39:21.859
Inside maybe?

39:22.827 --> 39:24.499
Guys we shouldn't go in there.

39:24.532 --> 39:25.933
I don't know.

39:25.968 --> 39:27.304
Maybe there are people
trapped that need our help.

39:27.337 --> 39:30.778
Yeah or maybe it's
crawling with infected.

39:30.810 --> 39:33.282
Look I don't think it's
worth taking the chance.

39:33.316 --> 39:34.485
It's not safe.

39:35.853 --> 39:38.926
You guys just wait here
yeah, I'm gonna go by myself.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.265
Whoa whoa whoa that is crazy.

39:41.298 --> 39:44.171
No come on Benny's
right, we'll go with you.

39:44.204 --> 39:46.376
Wait that's not what I meant.

39:46.409 --> 39:47.310
Come on.

39:47.344 --> 39:49.881
Babes I'm not going in there.

41:35.761 --> 41:40.303
Benny are you alright?

41:40.336 --> 41:41.806
Oh my god, please leave it.

41:41.839 --> 41:42.942
It's okay, it's okay.

41:42.975 --> 41:45.414
Get it around there.

41:45.447 --> 41:48.486
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

41:48.520 --> 41:50.490
We're gonna get help.

41:50.524 --> 41:51.626
We can get help.

41:51.659 --> 41:53.262
We're getting help.

41:53.295 --> 41:55.266
You're okay.

41:55.299 --> 41:57.938
Don't worry you're fine, really.

42:58.225 --> 42:59.528
Did I propose?

43:01.199 --> 43:03.536
I honestly can't remember.

43:03.570 --> 43:06.175
You were going to propose?

43:06.209 --> 43:08.580
On the top of the London Eye

43:08.613 --> 43:11.017
overlooking the whole city.

43:11.051 --> 43:14.023
It was gonna be really romantic.

43:26.883 --> 43:28.686
Will you marry me?

43:28.720 --> 43:30.690
Of course I will.

43:37.538 --> 43:38.606
It's perfect.

43:46.054 --> 43:47.891
You gonna put it on?

43:49.895 --> 43:51.866
I love it.

43:51.899 --> 43:54.405
Good I got a hell of a deal.

43:54.438 --> 43:56.576
- You did?
- Yeah.

43:56.609 --> 43:58.413
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

44:02.988 --> 44:04.391
She's not here.

44:06.262 --> 44:08.600
We're gonna find her okay?

44:10.337 --> 44:11.339
Yeah.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.276
Yeah.

44:14.411 --> 44:15.947
We will find her.

44:17.851 --> 44:20.122
- Yeah I know.
- 14th floor.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.396
Doors opening.

45:07.617 --> 45:09.788
How are you feeling?

45:09.822 --> 45:10.991
Don't worry.

45:26.490 --> 45:27.324
Let's go, let's go.

45:27.357 --> 45:29.795
You shouldn't be here.

45:29.828 --> 45:32.367
The hospital was
evacuated hours ago.

45:32.402 --> 45:33.636
You should leave.

45:33.669 --> 45:35.305
There are still infected
people in this building.

45:35.340 --> 45:36.542
It's not safe.

45:36.575 --> 45:37.978
Look my sister Nicole
Davis, she works here...

45:38.011 --> 45:40.182
No I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I don't know her.

45:40.215 --> 45:43.956
Look some people got
infected, some got killed.

45:43.990 --> 45:45.660
Others got out in time.

45:45.693 --> 45:46.862
You need to leave.

45:46.896 --> 45:48.332
Okay look my friend
was bitten okay.

45:48.366 --> 45:49.502
You have to help him.

45:49.536 --> 45:51.406
I'm sorry I can't,
it's too late.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.910
You don't understand do you?

45:53.943 --> 45:57.016
We're all going to die, you, me.

45:57.049 --> 45:58.051
I'm sorry.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.391
We're all dead.

46:15.285 --> 46:16.889
Benny no.

47:41.493 --> 47:42.595
Benny.

47:52.548 --> 47:53.550
Benny?

47:54.485 --> 47:55.487
Breathe.

47:56.955 --> 47:58.660
Benny, breathe honey.

48:02.702 --> 48:03.704
Breathe.

48:05.741 --> 48:08.379
You're okay.

48:08.412 --> 48:09.414
God.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.694
- Okay, come with us.
- I can't.

48:15.728 --> 48:17.262
You're safer than
with us than you are...

48:17.296 --> 48:21.204
I can't leave, I still got
one more patient to see to.

48:21.237 --> 48:24.579
Besides none of us
are going to survive.

48:29.086 --> 48:30.591
You need to leave.

48:33.194 --> 48:35.298
You can't stay here.

48:35.332 --> 48:37.202
I have to stay.

48:46.989 --> 48:49.193
Baby, Daddy's here darling.

48:50.664 --> 48:55.005
It's okay, it's okay,
everything's going to be okay.

48:55.038 --> 48:57.042
I love you my love.

48:57.075 --> 49:01.250
I love you so much, it's
okay baby.

49:08.298 --> 49:09.802
Just go, please.

49:12.072 --> 49:13.877
Before it's too late.

49:14.712 --> 49:16.047
Benny, please.

49:17.651 --> 49:19.086
Just stay back.

49:30.978 --> 49:32.815
You have to leave now.

49:38.091 --> 49:41.097
- You don't have to do this.
- Just go.

49:41.130 --> 49:44.572
You don't have to do
this, don't have to do this.

49:44.605 --> 49:45.406
- Go.
- You don't!

49:45.439 --> 49:46.508
- No.
- Benny!

50:14.030 --> 50:15.601
Where's Benny?

50:15.634 --> 50:18.104
- What's wrong?
- Where's Benny?

50:18.137 --> 50:20.476
- Say it.
- He wants to stay.

50:30.463 --> 50:32.132
Keep her safe Jim.

50:35.305 --> 50:38.144
Go, go.

50:39.313 --> 50:40.315
Go!

50:59.989 --> 51:01.525
We have to go.

51:06.836 --> 51:07.838
You're okay.

52:09.895 --> 52:12.233
Can we just take a moment?

52:16.474 --> 52:19.915
Okay but we need
to keep going.

52:19.949 --> 52:21.953
We're out
of the city okay.

52:24.591 --> 52:26.261
Did you hear that?

52:41.324 --> 52:43.095
We need to go okay?

52:46.001 --> 52:47.938
Katie, come on.

53:56.241 --> 53:57.243
Katie!

53:58.211 --> 53:59.213
Katie!

54:49.381 --> 54:50.617
Katie, Katie.

56:07.971 --> 56:09.307
She's gone okay.

56:13.315 --> 56:14.317
I'm sorry.

57:17.710 --> 57:18.712
Nicole.

57:25.927 --> 57:30.268
I thought you were...

57:30.302 --> 57:32.372
And Mom and Dad are they inside?

57:32.407 --> 57:33.409
No.

57:35.212 --> 57:36.849
Don't go in.

57:38.452 --> 57:39.454
No.

57:40.556 --> 57:41.558
I'm sorry.

57:43.395 --> 57:45.399
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57:45.433 --> 57:47.034
We can't go inside.

57:49.708 --> 57:50.877
I'm sorry.

58:09.581 --> 58:10.650
This is

58:10.683 --> 58:13.154
the emergency
broadcasting service.

58:13.187 --> 58:16.127
Communications have been
severely interrupted.

58:16.160 --> 58:17.597
The number of casualties

58:17.630 --> 58:20.803
and the extent of the
damage are not yet known.

58:20.836 --> 58:23.576
If you live in an area
where radiation has occurred

58:23.609 --> 58:26.415
stay in your shelter
until you are told

58:26.448 --> 58:27.917
it is safe to come out.

58:27.951 --> 58:30.087
When the immediate
danger has passed

58:30.121 --> 58:33.963
the sirens' all clear
message will be given.

58:33.996 --> 58:36.133
You shall be on the air...

58:46.488 --> 58:47.490
Hello?

58:53.469 --> 58:54.471
Hello?

58:58.379 --> 58:59.381
Owen?

59:08.364 --> 59:09.366
Owen?

59:13.842 --> 59:15.479
Jane?

59:22.192 --> 59:23.662
So you made it.

59:37.590 --> 59:40.663
I'm surprised you got through

59:40.696 --> 59:43.836
with everything
that's been going on.

59:52.520 --> 59:54.256
It's a two way radio.

59:56.026 --> 59:57.563
Can't pick up much.

59:58.532 --> 01:00:00.335
A few cries for help.

01:00:02.573 --> 01:00:03.876
You never know.

01:00:10.723 --> 01:00:15.266
I suppose you want a cup
of tea or something huh?

01:00:15.298 --> 01:00:17.637
I'll knock you something up.

01:00:22.145 --> 01:00:23.415
Where's Jane?

01:00:31.264 --> 01:00:33.067
She didn't make it.

01:01:14.651 --> 01:01:17.957
Thank you for
getting my sister home.

01:01:21.965 --> 01:01:24.470
She did her share, trust me.

01:01:26.374 --> 01:01:28.478
Yeah she's a tough one.

01:01:58.004 --> 01:01:59.206
It won't work.

01:02:03.548 --> 01:02:04.784
Eddie.

01:02:08.493 --> 01:02:10.796
Eddie don't make me do this.

01:02:10.829 --> 01:02:11.931
Eddie.

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:24.944
We need to talk.

01:03:38.738 --> 01:03:42.913
She got infected.

01:03:42.947 --> 01:03:44.585
She became violent.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.261
She attacked me.

01:03:53.334 --> 01:03:57.108
I just, I couldn't bring
myself to, you know.

01:04:03.788 --> 01:04:06.360
You should've said something.

01:04:08.163 --> 01:04:09.332
We just met.

01:04:10.869 --> 01:04:13.140
Didn't seem the right time.

01:04:16.548 --> 01:04:19.588
So what happens when that
thing decides to attack us?

01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:21.625
That thing is my wife.

01:04:30.207 --> 01:04:32.813
That's not your wife anymore.

01:04:33.982 --> 01:04:36.622
Too dangerous
to keep her here.

01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:41.498
I'm not gonna kill my wife.

01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:54.691
You're so young, so
naive, so quick to judge.

01:05:01.805 --> 01:05:05.379
Have you even thought
about a possible cure?

01:05:06.749 --> 01:05:09.085
No, you're too busy killing.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.401
You're murdering these people.

01:05:16.434 --> 01:05:19.205
Owen you've
killed, we saw you.

01:05:21.545 --> 01:05:23.046
In self defense.

01:05:26.954 --> 01:05:30.294
Eddie was my neighbor
for over 20 years.

01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:34.235
He's been wandering
around outside

01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:36.708
the cottage since this begun.

01:05:37.877 --> 01:05:41.283
I killed him when he
became a threat to us.

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:46.059
You.

01:05:48.398 --> 01:05:50.969
You're family, don't forget it.

01:05:53.776 --> 01:05:55.713
I look after my family.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:03.160
My wife is not a threat.

01:08:11.517 --> 01:08:13.187
We've got company.

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:16.527
Stay away from the windows.

01:08:27.783 --> 01:08:29.318
Nicole!

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:54.824
Get ready,
they're breaking in.

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:02.772
Take the radio and
leave out the back.

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:04.844
They're everywhere.

01:10:04.877 --> 01:10:06.513
Not for long.

01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:08.784
I'll lure them at the front.

01:10:08.819 --> 01:10:10.722
No, we stay together.

01:10:30.228 --> 01:10:32.400
I can feel it inside me.

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.859
You're family, go.

01:10:54.576 --> 01:10:55.846
Owen no.

01:10:55.879 --> 01:10:58.552
Go!

01:11:03.862 --> 01:11:05.298
Jim come on.

01:13:07.509 --> 01:13:08.344
Hello?

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.022
I can't believe
this happening.

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:33.495
I know.

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:41.076
The others they, they
came down for me and now...

01:13:42.011 --> 01:13:44.048
This is not your fault.

01:13:44.082 --> 01:13:47.423
You can't blame
yourself Jim, you can't.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:52.298
I wonder if there's
somewhere safe.

01:13:52.331 --> 01:13:55.204
Jim are we gonna
be safe in here?

01:13:57.041 --> 01:14:00.214
If you get that
thing working maybe.

01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:03.822
Owen said we gotta be
as high as possible.

01:14:03.855 --> 01:14:06.394
Yeah well the church tower.

01:14:06.427 --> 01:14:08.263
Yeah, okay let's go.

01:14:26.634 --> 01:14:27.703
Come on.

01:14:31.577 --> 01:14:33.681
Damn it we need a key.

01:14:33.715 --> 01:14:36.286
Well it must be
here somewhere.

01:14:52.285 --> 01:14:54.255
Guys I've got a key.

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:01.837
Here try that one.

01:15:06.781 --> 01:15:08.384
Just go.

01:15:08.418 --> 01:15:09.420
Go!

01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:18.671
Go!

01:15:34.102 --> 01:15:34.937
Jim?

01:15:39.345 --> 01:15:40.347
Jim!

01:15:41.216 --> 01:15:42.351
Go!

01:16:07.368 --> 01:16:08.370
Susan.

01:16:14.516 --> 01:16:16.152
Keep going.

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:29.345
Jim!

01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:45.245
No wait for him, wait no no.

01:16:45.277 --> 01:16:46.847
Jim!

01:16:46.881 --> 01:16:49.686
No he's coming, no he's coming.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.122
Listen for him.

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:39.151
Susan!

01:17:55.618 --> 01:17:56.620
Susan!

01:17:59.125 --> 01:18:01.463
Susan it's me open the door.

01:18:17.662 --> 01:18:21.837
That door won't hold.

01:18:49.693 --> 01:18:51.195
What do we do now?

01:18:56.474 --> 01:18:57.709
Are you okay?

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.518
Jim are you okay?

01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.597
Have you been bitten?

01:19:10.067 --> 01:19:11.837
Have you been bitten?

01:19:12.839 --> 01:19:13.841
No.

01:19:17.383 --> 01:19:18.684
Guys.

01:20:58.817 --> 01:21:02.760
This is Delta
914 Sierra Zulu.

01:21:02.792 --> 01:21:07.267
We have eyes on three civilians
on top of a church tower.

01:21:07.301 --> 01:21:11.477
Hard to determine if they're
contaminated or survivors.

01:21:12.613 --> 01:21:15.083
Targets are locked,
awaiting orders.

01:21:15.116 --> 01:21:17.154
Extract or shoot to kill.

01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:36.951
