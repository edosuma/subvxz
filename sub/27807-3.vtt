15:20.387 --> 15:23.221
For example, a sniper
from the Farnsworth House

15:23.223 --> 15:25.023
shot Jennie Wade
in her house.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.493

used to visit an orphanage,

15:28.495 --> 15:30.561

across the street.

those connections don't go away

15:33.767 --> 15:36.200
just because, you know,
people pass away.

So, if we go to some of these
other, more notorious haunts

15:39.806 --> 15:41.072
and just ask the entities,

15:41.074 --> 15:43.675
"Hey, is there someone
new in town

all across here,

16:03.463 --> 16:06.798

if something passes over them.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.735
And I saw a shadow figure
run toward me,

16:10.737 --> 16:15.039
and I saw the K-II start
to light up as it ran through.

16:15.041 --> 16:19.010
And something just grabbed me,
like, violently from the side.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.745
It, like, yanked me over.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.848
And that's never happened
to me before or since.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.284

I've really had an issue

16:26.286 --> 16:28.019

of that experience.

with an entity

because I've been
doing research,

40:36.868 --> 40:38.501
but then we asked Dana,

40:38.503 --> 40:41.571
and she pointed out
Clarence Collins.

40:41.573 --> 40:44.374
When the mirror was moved
to the basement,

40:44.376 --> 40:46.409
investigators came in
and tour groups came in.

40:46.411 --> 40:49.379
They started giving it
more intention.

40:49.381 --> 40:53.483
Many entities manifest because
of the amount of intention

40:53.485 --> 40:55.285
and energy
invested in them.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.421
So, when you have people
coming here every day

40:58.423 --> 40:59.756
looking at that mirror,

40:59.758 --> 41:02.258
it is feeding energy
into that mirror.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.526
What's happened is,

41:03.528 --> 41:05.962
this mirror does have a seed
of something in it.

41:05.964 --> 41:09.132
It has this seed
of Clarence Collins,

41:09.134 --> 41:11.968
and you're watering it
every day.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.804
The idea that people can come
here and focus on this killer

41:14.806 --> 41:17.273
and really just let him
take over this space

41:17.275 --> 41:18.775
is not acceptable,

41:18.777 --> 41:21.511
and people should have every
right to enjoy that space.

41:21.513 --> 41:23.780
So, what does that mean?

41:23.782 --> 41:25.882
We think
you should move it.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.451
Normally, we would not say
get rid of something,

41:28.453 --> 41:32.155
but because this thing does
kind of like to attack women,

41:32.157 --> 41:34.157
that activity's
only going to get worse,

41:34.159 --> 41:36.426
and that's not going to be fun
for people coming here.

41:36.428 --> 41:37.594
Yeah.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.696
So, I hope we were able
to help you.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.464
You have.
We're glad you came.
Absolutely.

41:41.466 --> 41:45.168
Now, listen -- let's go take
the mirror out of the basement.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.437
Into an undisclosed location.

41:47.439 --> 41:48.738
Exactly.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.275
The fact that we were able
to figure out

41:52.277 --> 41:55.678
where the mirror came from,
who it was associated with,

41:55.680 --> 41:59.048
I feel like we were able
to solve this case.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.117
Okay, ready, guys?
Uh-huh, yeah. Ready?

42:01.119 --> 42:02.785
Got it? Okay.
One, two, three.

42:04.155 --> 42:05.922
Careful.

42:05.924 --> 42:08.291
Now it's just a matter of,

42:08.293 --> 42:10.360
"Where's that mirror
going to end up?"

42:10.362 --> 42:13.162
It's really up to the family
and the employees here

42:13.164 --> 42:17.033
to decide what the future
of that mirror is.

42:17.035 --> 42:20.236
And while this haunting cannot
be linked to the battlefield,

42:20.238 --> 42:24.774
it proves once again
that Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,

42:24.776 --> 42:27.810
is a vibrant hot spot
for the paranormal.

42:27.812 --> 42:31.414
