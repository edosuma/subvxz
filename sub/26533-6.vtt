00:01.740 --> 00:03.786
Previously onCharmed...MEL: Tell the Elders

00:03.829 --> 00:06.528
I will do anything
to save her. Anything.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.572
It's a powerful history

00:07.616 --> 00:08.921
rewriting spell.

00:08.965 --> 00:11.054
MEL: To make it
as if Niko and I never met.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.099
HARRY: There will be
ripple effects and other

00:12.142 --> 00:13.491
unintended consequences

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
that simply cannot be foreseen.

00:15.102 --> 00:15.972
Oh, my God.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.495
I never got this job.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.062
Nice to meet you,
Maggie. I'm Summer.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.195
Look, I should
probably explain...How you got together

00:21.238 --> 00:22.848
with someone else, like,
a minute after we kissed?

00:22.892 --> 00:24.633
You mean after you blew me off
several times.

00:24.676 --> 00:25.851
I got the message,
and I moved on.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.375
Got the right message, didn't I?

00:27.418 --> 00:29.203
HARRY: A mark like that
cannot be dismissed.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.595
We need to know
exactly what it looked like.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.119
I need you to do
a social media deep dive

00:32.162 --> 00:34.295
and find out
who Parker cheated with.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.253
Ta-da. Found her.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.951
You are finished
at Kappa.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.518
I never want
to see your face

00:40.562 --> 00:41.519
again.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.741
MAGGIE:
Wakey, wakey.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.048
Hi, sunshine.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.614
You've been asleep
all day.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.529
The light.Good thing

00:51.573 --> 00:53.183
we're witches, not vampires.

00:53.227 --> 00:55.011
I was being constructive,
I swear.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.491
I was researching
something,

00:56.534 --> 00:59.146
and I passed out.Okay, we know
you're still hurting

00:59.189 --> 01:01.931
over Niko...But you can't stay moping
in bed forever.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.454
It's time to shower,

01:03.498 --> 01:05.108
put on something
other than yoga pants...

01:05.152 --> 01:07.023
And face the world.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.242
I wasn't moping.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.113
I was keeping busy.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.159
Look, the pattern
that was found on Mom

01:12.202 --> 01:14.161
and the other Elders
that were killed is something

01:14.204 --> 01:15.727
called a Lichtenberg figure.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.251
Yeah, I've
heard of them.

01:17.294 --> 01:20.819
They're associated
with high-voltage electricity.Exactly.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.256
And they're found
on people or places

01:22.299 --> 01:24.127
that have been struck
by lightning.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.608
So Mom was killed
by some sort of...

01:26.651 --> 01:28.131
lightning demon?

01:28.175 --> 01:29.915
MEL:
Seems like it.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.917
But, so far,
I've found 893 demons

01:31.961 --> 01:34.094
associated with lightning
and electricity.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.618
Why is it always hundreds
and never, like, five?

01:36.661 --> 01:37.706
Trust me,

01:37.749 --> 01:39.316
I'll find it.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.970
Okay, that's enough.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.450
You need to get
some fresh air.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.234
It smells
like old gym socks in here.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.322
Yeah, look,
you're not gonna crack

01:45.366 --> 01:48.325
this clue tonight.
So, I'm suggesting

01:48.369 --> 01:50.153
Mojito Night at the Haunt?

01:50.197 --> 01:51.502
Yes. Yes!

01:51.546 --> 01:52.503
Come on.
The Haunt.

01:52.547 --> 01:53.678
No excuses.

01:53.722 --> 01:54.679
You love the Haunt.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.333
You love the Haunt.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.728
♪ Work, work, harder, harder

01:59.771 --> 02:01.817
♪ We work, work
for the dollar, dollar ♪

02:01.860 --> 02:03.601
Cheers, bitches.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.168
What did you call us?

02:05.212 --> 02:07.170
Mm. :
It's code.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.476
You know,
pretend I'm saying

02:08.519 --> 02:11.043
the W-word instead.You know,

02:11.087 --> 02:14.395
I really am starting
to warm to your inane chatter.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.919
I may actually miss it
once the Elders determine

02:16.962 --> 02:18.399
it's time for me to move out.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.140
MEL: And when is
that, exactly?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.837
We do have The Book of Shadows
back.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.317
Well, I'm sure
their decision is imminent.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.016
Congratulations.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.583
To getting Mel out of the house.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.411
Yesh.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.413
Oh. Your shirt
is on inside out.

02:32.456 --> 02:33.718
I showered.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.633
That was your only requirement.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.421
Doesn't it feel so good
to be out, guys?

02:40.464 --> 02:41.509
I've practically
been an agoraphobe

02:41.552 --> 02:43.337
since Lucy kicked
me out of Kappa.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.426
You okay?Now my Insta's
full of...

02:45.469 --> 02:48.646
happy pledges, all excited
for Initiation Week.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.301
I would have been a full-fledged
Kappa sister tomorrow.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.564
You'll find
another group to join.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.263
Greek life is toxic anyway.

02:56.306 --> 02:57.873
MACY: Well, I'm glad
we're out, too.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.354
I can't stop thinking
about that mark on Galvin,

03:00.397 --> 03:02.617
and I haven't been able to find
it in The Book of Shadows.

03:02.660 --> 03:06.273
Galvin's seemingly
normal outward appearance

03:06.316 --> 03:08.144
doesn't preclude him
from danger.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.059
I've done some research.

03:10.102 --> 03:13.454
There are several
recently recorded instances

03:13.497 --> 03:15.369
of mortals being marked
by demons

03:15.412 --> 03:17.327
as part of--
one assumes--

03:17.371 --> 03:19.808
a larger plan.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.332
A demon could be using Galvin
to get to the three of you.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.334
You must remain
on your guard.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.727
Mm-hmm.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.728
Here you go.Thank you.
Oh.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.077
Thank you.So kind.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.559
Can anyone spot me?

03:31.602 --> 03:33.735
No job means no check.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.389
Oh, on that subject,

03:35.432 --> 03:37.826
there's an opening
in the administrative department

03:37.869 --> 03:39.262
at the university.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.829
I pulled some strings
and got you an interview

03:40.872 --> 03:41.830
tomorrow afternoon.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.135
Hey, that's great.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.224
The administrative department?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.268
It is a paycheck.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.574
And it gets you out
of the house.

03:46.617 --> 03:47.966
Fine.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.054
Whatever.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.013
It's just an interview.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.101
Good.WOMAN: Hi, Lucy!

03:52.144 --> 03:53.972
LUCY :
Yes!

03:54.016 --> 03:55.887
Oh, my gosh. Hey, Ben.Hey. What's up?

03:55.931 --> 03:57.280
LUCY :
How's it going?

03:57.324 --> 04:00.065
WOMAN 2: Hey, girl.LUCY: My ladies.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.077
MACY:
Should we...

04:12.121 --> 04:14.950
finish our drinks
and go home?No.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.344
Maybe this is my chance
to clear the air.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.780
I'll bring over a pitcher
of skinny mojitos

04:18.823 --> 04:20.521
as a peace offering.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.050
Hi.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.054
Um...

04:32.097 --> 04:33.316
I know I'm probably, like,

04:33.360 --> 04:35.623
the last person you want
to see right now.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.189
But I just
want to say,

04:37.233 --> 04:39.148
again,

04:39.191 --> 04:41.106
I'm sorry.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.804
I really screwed up.

04:44.588 --> 04:45.981
I can't change
what happened,

04:46.024 --> 04:49.158
but at least you can
have a round on me.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.508
You know, that is
just what I need.

04:51.552 --> 04:54.206
Mm. A round on you.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.302
Don't.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.912
Let her do it.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.349
If she lets it all out,
maybe she'll forgive me.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.611
Maggie.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.961
I kissed her boyfriend,
and I lied about it.

05:10.005 --> 05:13.051
I deserve to be drenched
in rum and aspartame.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.052
Nobody deserves that.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.149
I meant to do that.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.150
Those boots

05:25.194 --> 05:26.891

05:26.935 --> 05:29.329
Stay away from me, Maggie.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.070

I think something's up at Kappa.Agree.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.974
They're internalizing the
patriarchy, for starters.

09:44.018 --> 09:45.454
I'm serious.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.630

09:47.674 --> 09:50.067
Why would you do that,
after what she did to you?

09:50.111 --> 09:51.634
You're missing the point.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.115
There was a new sister.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.333
Brenda.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.683
I've never seen her before

09:57.727 --> 09:59.250

09:59.294 --> 10:01.209
Remember Summer the Succubus?

10:01.252 --> 10:04.647
You thought she was a demon when
she actually was just amazing.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.301
You're just projecting.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.129
No, you don't understand.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.131
If Brenda were a real Kappa,
I would know.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.524

to memorize every Kappa's name,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.316

can't find her.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.543

and fell off the Kappa roof.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.328
February 13.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.330

10:35.373 --> 10:38.246
Well, that explains
the eye shadow.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.378
Brenda from Kappa's
a freaking ghost.

10:47.037 --> 10:49.779
A ghost. Oh, dear.Don't tell me a ghost

10:49.823 --> 10:50.867
is worse than a demon.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.086
Well, that all depends
on the type

10:52.129 --> 10:54.131
of ghost, I'm afraid.
There are...

10:54.175 --> 10:56.133
Five?Hundreds.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.135

from Casper

10:58.179 --> 10:59.702

11:01.051 --> 11:02.792
No! Oh...

11:05.795 --> 11:08.537
HARRY: Oh, dear,
it looks awful.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.843
Galvin didn't want
to invite me anyway,

11:09.886 --> 11:11.322
Summer already thinks
I'm some jealous clinger,

11:11.366 --> 11:13.281
and now I'm the weirdo
bringing the burnt pie.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.891
Maybe I
shouldn't go.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.501
Yeah, it sounds like you need
help identifying this ghost.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.720
Macy, you can't ignore
this mark.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.243
It's glowing brighter.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.810
Danger could be imminent.MEL: Don't worry.

11:20.854 --> 11:23.465
I'll help Maggie
with the ghost.And youhave

11:23.508 --> 11:24.466

11:24.509 --> 11:26.511
This is obviously
more important.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.556
I think Maggie
can handle

11:27.599 --> 11:28.731
looking up a spell in the Book.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.037
Plus, you hate Kappa.I'm not gonna

11:30.080 --> 11:32.779
let you face
a demonic ghost alone.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.129
HARRY: Fine.
Consult the Book.
It will tell you

11:35.172 --> 11:36.870
how to identify
the type of specter

11:36.913 --> 11:38.349
and then how
to vanquish it.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.524
Keep me posted.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.222
In the meantime...

11:41.265 --> 11:43.311
why don't I accompany you
to your soiree.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.009
Maggie couldn't see the mark,

11:46.053 --> 11:47.010
but perhaps I can.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.620
And Summer
won't think you're

11:48.664 --> 11:50.710
the jealous type if you arrive
with a chap on your arm.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.756
I guess that's true.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.454
I also happen to have
a delightful recipe

11:56.498 --> 11:58.587
for Welsh rarebit.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.545
Welsh rabbit?

12:00.589 --> 12:03.548
Rarebit. It's an exquisite
cheese sauce on toast.

12:03.592 --> 12:04.767
A real hit

12:04.811 --> 12:06.813
at gatherings. It's...O-Okay.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.466
Yeah, fine.
I-I guess you can come.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.816
Splendid.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.382
Have fun, you two.

12:12.688 --> 12:13.733
Mmm.

12:13.776 --> 12:17.649
How do we identify a ghost?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.394
"Call to a restless spirit."

12:23.438 --> 12:24.787
Okay, so to determine
what type of ghost,

12:24.831 --> 12:26.397
we need to know
what she wants,

12:26.441 --> 12:28.138
why she's haunting.

12:28.182 --> 12:30.184
We need to recreate the moment
that the ghost can't

with this spell.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.326
Brenda Mancini

14:52.369 --> 14:55.155

no longer a Kappa.

It's Mom.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.480
Wait, but what about Brenda?

15:16.524 --> 15:18.482
We already know what
they did to her.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.136
This is Mom.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.924
You were just with the doctor?
What did he say?

15:24.967 --> 15:27.143
The doctor says
everything's fine.

MARISOL:
Couldn't it?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.026
I'm a witch

Marisol, you can't
keep obsessing like this.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.075

No, this is
more than that.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.954

wrong with the baby.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.959
Really wrong.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.020
Why did it end?
I wanted to see more.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.804
Me too.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.806
She was so young.

About the baby.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.681
What do you think it means?

16:26.724 --> 16:29.553
Well, obviously Macy
came out fine.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.296
And I think we know
what kind of ghost Brenda is.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.820
She must be a banshee.
She died in pain,

16:35.864 --> 16:38.171
and now she's spreading
sorrow and misery.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.042
Do we really have
to get rid of her?

16:40.086 --> 16:43.176

a little sorrow and misery.

20:06.683 --> 20:10.426
I should get course credit
for being a witch.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.775
It's not working.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.429
Are you sure about this?

20:13.473 --> 20:15.605
Yes. I saw Niko do it once.

20:28.444 --> 20:30.794
Where are they?

20:54.514 --> 20:56.472
That crazy bitch
left with Lucy.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.474
Was it the crazy bitch with
the janky two

20:58.518 --> 21:00.650
Brenda?Yes.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.349
I think I peed my skinnies.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.307
This is weird.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.570
These girls aren't
under Brenda's spell.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.659
But Lucy was.
She thought Brenda was a sister.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.053
So she's not haunting everyone.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.533
Just Lucy.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.840
Any idea on where they went?

21:16.884 --> 21:18.277
Uh, I don't know.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.496
Uh, th-that Brenda girl

21:20.540 --> 21:23.194
was talking about some,
um, treacherous friend

21:23.238 --> 21:25.284
and how it was unfair.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.590
A treacherous friend.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.766
She must mean...Jenna,

21:29.810 --> 21:32.029
the mean girl from the
quad who betrayed her.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.683
Brenda wants revenge.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.119
And because
she doesn't have a body,

21:35.163 --> 21:36.643
she needs Lucy
to do her bidding.

21:36.686 --> 21:38.209
Jenna's in danger.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.254
Oh, God.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.429
We have to find her.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.432
Um, keep them frozen.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.651
I have an idea.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.456
I found her. Harry!

22:08.805 --> 22:10.807
We have to save a middle-aged
sorority sister.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.113
I'm sorry... what?

22:12.156 --> 22:13.680
No time to explain.

22:13.723 --> 22:16.378
Her name is Jenna Gordonson
and she's in danger.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.641
Can you access the alumni
database and find her address?

22:18.685 --> 22:19.599
Well, yes, but I...

22:19.642 --> 22:21.601
And wipe their
memories. Hurry!

22:21.644 --> 22:22.732
Good God,

22:22.776 --> 22:24.168
a Whitelighter's work
is never done.

22:31.915 --> 22:35.266
MACY:
"The cowrie shell shields
the bearer."

22:35.310 --> 22:36.311
Hmm.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.399
Sorry about that,
your sisters

22:37.443 --> 22:39.358
are on the trail of a banshee.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.447
Are they okay?Thus far.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.405
Now, were were we?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.407
I think Galvin's mark
is a cowrie shell.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.843
The Booksays
in Yoruba tradition

22:46.887 --> 22:48.149
it's placed upon infants
to give them

22:48.192 --> 22:50.064
lifelong protection
from magical beings.

22:50.107 --> 22:51.108
Good news, then.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.241
This mark is not
of demonic origin.

22:53.284 --> 22:55.809
It still doesn't explain why I'm
the only one who can see it.

22:55.852 --> 22:58.507
Well, is it possible you're
the one who activated it,

22:58.551 --> 23:00.727
with that kiss on Halloween?

23:00.770 --> 23:02.381
It would explain
why you and Galvin

23:02.424 --> 23:03.947
were driven apart
in the time since.

23:03.991 --> 23:07.473
I don't know if I can
blame that on the mark.

23:07.516 --> 23:09.823
I pretty much drove him away.

23:09.866 --> 23:13.783
I've been pretty unapproachable
as long as I've known him.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.612
Don't say that
about yourself, Macy.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.484
You're not like
that at all.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.490
Thanks, Harry.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.666
Thanks for coming
to Galvin's party with me.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.450
My pleasure.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.104
You're a good friend.

23:30.147 --> 23:33.324
Well, thank you.

23:33.368 --> 23:36.980
I enjoy you and your
sisters' company, too.

23:38.504 --> 23:42.725
In truth, the Elders
decided days ago

23:42.769 --> 23:44.945
you three no longer need
added protection,

23:44.988 --> 23:47.600
now the Bookhas been returned,
but I-I must confess,

23:47.643 --> 23:49.863
I've been rather
reluctant to leave.

23:49.906 --> 23:52.431
As exotic and thrilling
as my life may seem,

23:52.474 --> 23:55.651
it can be isolating.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.393
Being here has
been a nice change.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.875
I suppose what I'm
trying to say

24:01.918 --> 24:03.920
is I consider you three...

24:05.879 --> 24:07.533
friends, as well.

24:07.576 --> 24:11.493
Harry, that is so sweet.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.365
Good.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.370
Hey, you know
what Galvin told me?

24:19.414 --> 24:21.198
He has family from Haiti.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.244
I'm pretty sure forms

24:23.287 --> 24:25.333
of the Yoruba religion
are practiced there.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.953
Bingo. A priestess.

24:36.997 --> 24:40.914
Haitian Yoruba practitioner
not far from here.

24:40.957 --> 24:42.872
Four stars on
Yelp, no less.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.134
Let's go.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.093
Maybe she can tell me

24:46.136 --> 24:47.529
why I'm the only one
who can see this mark.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.531
Dr. Vaughn,
the scientist,

24:49.575 --> 24:52.969
wishes to seek counsel
from a priestess?

24:53.013 --> 24:55.406
Well, Harry,
this is a scientist

24:55.450 --> 24:57.017
who got dressed
with her mind this morning.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.801
Fair point.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.587
WOMAN: You're reporters from BuzzFeed?

25:01.630 --> 25:03.545
Yeah. We're, uh,
intrepid reporters.Ah.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.374
And you're Jenna Gordonson,
Kappa alum, correct?

25:06.417 --> 25:08.463
Yes.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.814
I was president
in the late '80s.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.817
And you're safe,
so that's good.

25:14.861 --> 25:17.559
What is it you ladies
wanted to ask me?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.474
Oh, we are doing an article:

25:19.518 --> 25:21.258
ten spookiest deaths
in the Greek system,

25:21.302 --> 25:23.522
and we wanted to ask you
about one of them.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.872
Why, has there been
another death at Kappa?

25:25.915 --> 25:27.874
Anotherdeath at Kappa?

25:28.875 --> 25:30.354
What do you mean?

25:34.402 --> 25:36.404
Brenda's death
really shook me.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.885
As Kappa president,
I tried to cut down

25:38.928 --> 25:41.235
on the drinking on Greek Row.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.846
But that wasn't
very popular, so...

25:43.890 --> 25:46.240
girls kept dying
in the same way.

25:46.283 --> 25:50.026
Getting drunk,
climbing up on the roof...

25:50.070 --> 25:52.115
and falling to their deaths.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.074
Why is this this first I'm
hearing of these accidents?

25:54.117 --> 25:55.510
Because the alumni board
covers it up.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.686
But it's in the papers.

25:57.730 --> 25:58.818
JENNA:
Sure, it's in the papers,

25:58.861 --> 26:00.559
but you won't find
any link to Kappa.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.952
And Brenda was the first
of these deaths?

26:02.996 --> 26:04.563
What exactly
happened with her?

26:04.606 --> 26:07.914
We know she was bullied and
kicked out of pledge class.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.045
Bullied?

26:09.089 --> 26:12.788
Brenda was the bully.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.616
We don't bully at Kappa.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.575
Exactly.

26:16.618 --> 26:17.967
See? This is what
I've been telling you.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.839
I don't get it.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.406
You were her friend
and you kicked her out.

26:22.450 --> 26:23.451
JENNA:
You would have kicked
her out, too,

26:23.494 --> 26:25.714
if you knew what
she was really like.

26:25.758 --> 26:29.588
Cruel. Manipulative.
No loyalty.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.591
She slept with Heather M.
and Heather B.'s boyfriends.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.288
The night after
we cut her,

26:34.331 --> 26:36.943
she broke into Kappa,

26:36.986 --> 26:39.162
stole her initiation candle--
God knows why--

26:39.206 --> 26:43.558
then climbed up onto the roof to
hang a banner saying all kinds

26:43.602 --> 26:46.648
of nasty stuff about us.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.999
But she was drunk
on wine coolers...

26:50.043 --> 26:52.480
and she fell.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.614
We got this all wrong.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.616
Brenda died in anger.
She's a revenant.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.270
And she's been killing sisters
the same way she died.

27:00.314 --> 27:02.055
Oh, my God.

27:02.098 --> 27:04.144
Brenda's gonna kill Lucy.

27:07.234 --> 27:10.150
Can't we go back
to the store

27:10.193 --> 27:12.108
for something less
cough

27:12.152 --> 27:14.067
Shut up and chug, loser.

27:14.110 --> 27:16.112
Okay.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.781
MACY:
Nails, too.

27:32.825 --> 27:36.393
Well, this priestess
certainly knows how to hustle.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.569
We all have day jobs, Macy,

27:38.613 --> 27:40.223
and they come in various forms.

27:40.267 --> 27:43.966
Consider me, a learned
Women's Studies professor wi...

27:45.402 --> 27:46.447
Harry?

27:46.490 --> 27:48.231
Your sisters
are calling me again.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.798
Can you proceed solo?

27:49.842 --> 27:51.408
Of course.

27:57.850 --> 27:58.938
MAMA ROZ:
So...

27:58.981 --> 28:00.722
my dear,

28:00.766 --> 28:03.203
you seek the light
of knowledge?

28:05.466 --> 28:08.817
You've come to
the right place.

28:08.861 --> 28:11.733
It's $20 for ten minutes.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.214
This is a rare chance

28:14.257 --> 28:17.521
to hear from someone
who has the sight.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.784
The ability to hear

28:18.827 --> 28:21.743
precisely what you need to know.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.919
Trust Mama Roz.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.008
I have the gift.

28:26.052 --> 28:28.228
And bills to pay,
so, if you don't mind.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.056
Mm.

28:33.146 --> 28:37.933
So I just need to know
more about this symbol.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.680
Where did you see this mark?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.247
On a friend.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.118
And yousaw it?

28:49.162 --> 28:50.903
Yes.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.600
I think it's
some kind of

28:52.643 --> 28:54.776
protection ward, right?

28:56.909 --> 28:58.432
Yes.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.827
Fates step in
if the wearer of the mark

29:01.870 --> 29:03.350
gets too close.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.832
Close, mOh, no.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.878
Stay away from him...
or her.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.228
They're not for you.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.795
Why?

29:13.839 --> 29:17.407
Because...

29:17.451 --> 29:19.932
you've got the Ibi in you.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.934
What does the Ibi mean?

29:21.977 --> 29:24.719
I believe your time is up.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.810
Tell me.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.297
It means darkness.

29:37.340 --> 29:41.214
You've got darkness
inside you.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.650
Since you were born.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.826
:
Forget it.

29:44.870 --> 29:46.001
I don't know what I
was thinking consulting

29:46.045 --> 29:47.829
a psychic for answers.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.571
You're different from
your sisters, child.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.836
Search within.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.752
Don't you feel it?

30:00.799 --> 30:03.802
The pillar of your path holds
the key to your darkness.

30:14.551 --> 30:18.425
Maybe we should
go back down, Brenda.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.862
We're not supposed
to be up here.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.646
Stop being such
a buzzkill.

30:22.690 --> 30:24.866
The fun is just
getting started.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.870
But I'm afraid of heights.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.132
Oh, don't worry.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.873
You won't be here long.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.354
'Cause you're gonna jump.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.095
What?

30:36.138 --> 30:38.227
After this wine cooler

30:38.271 --> 30:39.881
you will be
just drunk enough.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.709
You're gonna jump, Lucy.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.058
You are gonna die,

30:43.102 --> 30:46.757
just like I did.

30:46.801 --> 30:50.500
Brenda... I can't.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.372
You can and you will.

30:56.419 --> 30:57.812
Oh, for the love of God,

30:57.856 --> 30:59.553
that really takes it out of me.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.685
Sorry, Harry, but this
is a real Kappamergency.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.600
Guys!

31:03.644 --> 31:04.906
Lucy, stop!

31:04.950 --> 31:06.516
Mel, start the
Revenant Vanquishing spell.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.127
Okay. Okay.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.476
Audi nos, refer

31:09.519 --> 31:10.869
te unde subivieris.

31:15.090 --> 31:17.832
Sorry. Yeah, still here.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.442
Bummer-rama for you.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.053
Oh, my God,
why didn't it work?

31:21.096 --> 31:23.490
LUCY:
Leave me alone!

31:23.533 --> 31:25.405
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

31:25.448 --> 31:27.233
for me every time you show up

31:27.276 --> 31:29.670
reminding me
of what you did?!

31:29.713 --> 31:32.934
We were friends, Maggie.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.893
I trusted you.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.895
Oh, my God.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.027
I get it. I did this.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.899
I'm the treacherous friend.

31:40.942 --> 31:42.465
Lucy, I'm so sorry!

31:42.509 --> 31:43.858
I've been so selfish.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.773
Maggie doesn't care about you.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.470
You know what would
hurt her the most?

31:47.514 --> 31:49.081
If you jumped
to your death.

No!Time to bounce, Lucy. Jump!

32:04.313 --> 32:06.446
No!

32:08.578 --> 32:10.102
No!

32:12.365 --> 32:14.497
She's trying
to break my concentration.

32:14.541 --> 32:17.022
Figure out what the hell
this is, or Lucy is toast!

32:17.065 --> 32:18.414
Mortals can sometimes
conjure ghosts.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.897
"In which case, one
must heal the hurt

32:22.941 --> 32:24.507
of the conjurer
to vanquish it."

32:24.551 --> 32:27.075
We need to heal Lucy's hurt,
and not Brenda's,

32:27.119 --> 32:28.076
and I'm the one
who hurt her.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.035
Whatever it is, do it fast.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.471
Harry, can't you teleport
up there and get her?

32:31.514 --> 32:33.429
Oh, teleport into midair?Yeah.

32:33.473 --> 32:36.171
Oh, it's a bit unorthodox,
but yes, I suppose so.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.441
Lucy,

32:45.485 --> 32:47.574
I'm so sorry.

32:47.617 --> 32:50.446
She's lying.
Lucy, kill her!

32:52.448 --> 32:53.275
Maggie!

32:53.319 --> 32:55.669
Don't.
I was selfish.

32:55.712 --> 32:57.192
I wasn't a loyal friend,

32:57.236 --> 32:59.803
and then I played the victim,
like Brenda,

32:59.847 --> 33:02.197
because I felt excluded.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.330
I kept trying
to get you to forgive me,

33:04.373 --> 33:07.028
when what you really needed
was space.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.683
And I'm so sorry.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.903
Thank you.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.258
Whoa.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.624
You again.

33:39.887 --> 33:43.151
Ugh. My head is killing me.

33:43.195 --> 33:45.066
You, um...

33:45.110 --> 33:47.329
drank a lot
of wine coolers tonight.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.592
Wine coolers?

33:49.636 --> 33:51.986
That's a new low.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.642
Wait, what are
you doing here?

33:55.685 --> 33:58.732
And why do I feel
less mad at you?

33:58.775 --> 34:00.995
We had a talk
while you were drunk.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.131
And I'm gonna
give you some space.

34:06.174 --> 34:09.612
I would love if we could
be friends again someday.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.701

Well, I have
to give her some space,

34:31.025 --> 34:33.941

she doesn't hate me.

34:33.984 --> 34:37.553
What about Kappa?

34:37.597 --> 34:39.773
Yeah, it's not happening.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.603
I'm sorry.

34:43.646 --> 34:47.128
I wasn't hearing how
important Kappa was to you.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.739
And we all need lives
outside of being a witch.

34:51.393 --> 34:54.353

I can feel
how sad you are.

35:07.757 --> 35:11.239
And I can smell how long
you've been wearing that shirt.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.896
I wore this the day we met.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.768
And it's like I don't
want to take it off,

35:18.812 --> 35:21.293

real, you know?

35:21.336 --> 35:24.122

And that's why I haven't
wanted to look for a new job.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.171
Then I'm really
starting a new life...

35:30.215 --> 35:31.781
without her.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.741
Yeah, it's hard to let go.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.779
Yeah. What is it?

36:12.822 --> 36:15.521

about Galvin's mark.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.697
Uh, a priestess, really.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.003
She told me
I have darkness in me.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.310
