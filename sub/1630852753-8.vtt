WEBVTT

01:00.060 --> 01:03.564
Thank you so much
for letting me ask her a few questions.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.400
So--

01:06.984 --> 01:10.070
Germain just landed. He and the captain
are in a squad car on the way here, so…

01:10.153 --> 01:11.572
Okay.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.449
Hi, honey. You're not in trouble.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.119
I just wanna ask you,
what do you remember from tonight?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.913
This night was so much fun!

01:19.997 --> 01:22.249
Okay! Tell me about it.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.420
I came to school
because Veronica had an emergency.

01:26.503 --> 01:30.757
When I got to school, I saw Mommy
hugging a man and maybe kissing him too?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.051
This is Kevin Koala.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.512
He played with my koala
and made him sing silly,

01:35.596 --> 01:38.974
like, "G'day, crikey, wallaby, billabong."

01:41.268 --> 01:43.520
When Daddy was going to take me home,

01:43.604 --> 01:46.064
the silly singing man still had my koala.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.357
I wanted it, so I said…

01:47.441 --> 01:50.611
He has my koala! I want my koala!

01:50.694 --> 01:53.864
And Daddy said,
"Okay, okay. We'll get your koala."

01:53.947 --> 01:57.451
And then, we were like, vroom, vroom!

01:57.534 --> 01:59.203
-Yeah!
-We were driving really, really fast.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.330
It was so much fun. Vroom!

02:02.039 --> 02:04.166
I said, "Can I have some fruit snacks?"

02:04.249 --> 02:07.044
And Daddy said, "Okay."
But he didn't give them to me.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.669
Vroom!

02:10.255 --> 02:14.301
And then, Daddy got out and told me,
"Wait right here."

02:14.968 --> 02:17.721
And then,
the man who serves the food on the trays

02:17.804 --> 02:20.265
came out of the garage
and saw me, and said,

02:20.349 --> 02:23.560
"Are you just gonna leave your kid
in the car unattended?"

02:23.644 --> 02:26.730
"Don't tell me how to parent!
I left the window down a crack."

02:26.813 --> 02:28.524
He whomped him on the nose.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.150
And then, he went inside.

02:30.859 --> 02:36.448
And then I waited a long time.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.367
It was so boring.

02:38.450 --> 02:42.162
I decided I better go tell Daddy that
he forgot to give me the fruit snacks,

02:42.246 --> 02:43.956
since he'd really want to know that.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.793
When I went into the party,
it was so cool.

02:56.844 --> 02:57.928
Walt.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.727
The man who sang with the koala
was sleeping on the floor.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.024
"Do you wanna come draw
on the silly sleeping man?"

03:11.108 --> 03:13.569
Yeah. I'm a great drawer.
I'll draw a kitty.

03:19.116 --> 03:23.370
Then I saw the big picture
of the man from Hungry Hungry Hippos.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.872
It's my favorite movie.

03:24.955 --> 03:29.209
Von Poacher injected them
with a serum that makes them hungry.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.502
How hungry?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.922
Hungry hungry.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.134
Here they come.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.053
Then, the most amazing thing happens.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.731
Got 'em!

03:52.941 --> 03:54.484
You gotta run!

03:57.529 --> 03:58.906
-Okay, Maggie?
-Yeah?

03:58.989 --> 04:00.782
Can you get back to the story,
please, honey?

04:00.866 --> 04:02.201
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.120
I was exploring the party
when, all of a sudden--

04:06.914 --> 04:08.540
"Oh, my gosh."

04:09.082 --> 04:10.584
-Uh-oh.
-Daddy saw me!

04:13.795 --> 04:16.130
So I decided we're playing hide-and-seek.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.303
Now Daddy won't recognize me.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.438
Ten! Ten! Ten! Ten!

04:41.740 --> 04:44.201
"Maggie, I see you in that wig."

04:44.785 --> 04:46.245
Didn't work.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.917
-"Excuse me. Sorry."
-Walt. Walt. Walt.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.545
-Walt. Walt. Walt. Walt. Walter.
-"Out of my way, please."

05:02.511 --> 05:03.512
"Gotcha."

05:06.849 --> 05:08.225
"Did Mommy see you?"

05:08.308 --> 05:12.062
No, but I saw Mommy.
I saw her with the singing man.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.606
"You saw her? With him?

05:14.690 --> 05:17.234
Was it Xavier? What were they doing?"

05:17.317 --> 05:19.278
He was the guy we saw at the school.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.321
I think they were smooching.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.825
Then he said,
"I have one more thing to do.

05:24.908 --> 05:28.078
Then we gotta go home as fast as we can."

05:28.745 --> 05:32.499
So when he said that last part,
did he say it in a nice way?

05:33.292 --> 05:35.460
No. He was using his thunder voice.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.964
"Smooching? I have one more thing to do.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.967
Then we gotta go home as fast as we can!

05:42.050 --> 05:44.011
Do not leave this car until I come back!

05:44.887 --> 05:46.054
Xavier!"

05:49.016 --> 05:51.852
And then there was some screaming,
and then I fell asleep.

05:51.935 --> 05:55.272
So he wanted to do one more thing,
and then there was screaming, huh?

05:55.898 --> 05:58.901
Can we maybe not do that in front of her?

05:59.860 --> 06:04.281
Hey, sweetie, is there anything else
that you remember seeing or hearing or…

06:05.073 --> 06:06.074
Anything at all?

06:06.867 --> 06:10.579
Well, I did see one more thing,
but it was kind of a bad thing.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.497
Tell me about it.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.084
I peeked out
when I heard all the screaming,

06:16.168 --> 06:19.963
and the front door was kinda open,
but I couldn't see much.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.092
But I did see the pregnant lady
named number 2 screaming upset

06:24.176 --> 06:26.553
because she peed on the floor.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.180
She said, "My water broke!"

06:30.474 --> 06:34.478
But I knew she was peeing
because it came from inside her dress.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.104
She wasn't even holding a water!

06:36.188 --> 06:39.316
I think you're right about that.
I might have slipped in that earlier.

06:39.399 --> 06:44.446
Look, call Matsuno. Tell him to check
all the local hospital maternity wards.

06:45.656 --> 06:49.993
Thank you so much. You did a great job.
Give me five.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.539
Yeah! You're awesome.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.169
Zoë, one last question.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.797
You said that you and Chelsea
stepped towards the bar

07:01.880 --> 07:03.465
when Aniq woke up to see
what was happening?

07:03.549 --> 07:04.550
Yeah.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.510
How long would you say
you were away from the stairs?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.555
-For maybe, like, one minute?
-Thank you.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.433
I need to go upstairs and check out
Xavier's room really quick,

07:13.517 --> 07:14.977
and then I'll be ready to make an arrest.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.187
So who did it?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.148
Just gather everybody up
in the living room, please.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.861
What happened in there?

07:23.944 --> 07:27.114
I think she thinks Brett…

07:28.323 --> 07:32.244
While we were all distracted
when you woke up, she thinks he…

07:33.370 --> 07:34.496
Are you okay?

07:36.748 --> 07:37.875
Not really.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.255
I think I need to just
put my daughter back to sleep.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.632
-Daddy!
-Hey, Maggles.

07:45.716 --> 07:49.178
Can I talk to you for one second? No?
I'll find you in a second. I love you.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.181
It was Brett. I knew it. Remember I was
telling you before it had to be Brett?

07:52.264 --> 07:54.600
-Everyone, just stay in the room.
-I know.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.518
Tell me again. Should we stay in the room?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.021
Yeah.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.982
And it's amazing for you,
because it means you're in the clear.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.442
I don't think Brett did it.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.943
Sorry? Why?

08:05.027 --> 08:06.695
Listen up, everyone.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.072
Wake up! Come on, now.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.618
Good news, everyone. No more waiting.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.536
I know who the killer is.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.332
I'm sorry.
Are you just gonna tell us all as a group?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.792
As a first responder,
that is highly unusual.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.086
You are a part-time volunteer fireman.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.839
You do it for the love, not the money.
Gandhi said that.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.674
Gandhi absolutely did not say that.

08:27.758 --> 08:28.926
Well, he should have.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.178
Twelve minutes. We have 12 minutes.

08:31.261 --> 08:35.515
Thank you. So you all
have been talking all night long.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.683
And now, it's my turn to talk.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.145
-Oh, my God!
-What now?

08:40.229 --> 08:43.482
I just got Jennifer 2's
birth announcement.

08:43.565 --> 08:48.028
"Husband is on the way back from Tokyo.
Mama and baby are doing just fine."

08:49.863 --> 08:53.158
Oh, my God. Look,
I'm trying to tell you who killed Xavier!

08:53.742 --> 08:54.910
So listen up.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.621
Let's talk about who could have done it.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.039
Chelsea,

08:59.122 --> 09:03.919
you are the last person
admitted to seeing Xavier alive.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.258
And she gave him
her flask full of cat roofies.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.677
-I--
-Wait. Chelsea, you drugged him?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.304
-What?
-Oh, my gosh.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.182
Let's say she's lying,
that she didn't just walk away,

09:17.266 --> 09:21.478
that she gave him that kitty cat juice

09:21.562 --> 09:24.189
-and then pushed him off the edge! Right?
-No.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.651
And then, walked
on downstairs like nothing happened.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.945
You tell me. She a little bit off, right?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.405
-She's a nut job.
-A little bit.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.823
-She's crazy.
-She's crazy.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.449
But I didn't.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.201
I know, honey.

09:36.285 --> 09:41.748
Because Indigo said that she saw
Zoë and Chelsea by the stairs

09:41.832 --> 09:44.668
as Jenn 1 felt a tinkle on her head
from Xavier,

09:44.751 --> 09:47.796
who was pouring out that flask,
still alive.

09:47.880 --> 09:52.968
And also, it wasn't cat roofies.
It was just cat tranquilizers.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.471
With whiskey and a splash of ginger.
It's my signature.

09:56.555 --> 10:01.185
So, Jenn 1, that's what was drizzling down
in your hair. Not pee.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.938
I'm sorry.
Is that supposed to be better, somehow?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.148
-Way better.
-Objectively, yes.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.066
-Human urine?
-Than pee?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.151
Not in Europe.

10:09.234 --> 10:13.405
And there's one other person
that we all saw--

10:13.488 --> 10:16.158
Well, most of y'all saw--
go up them stairs. That's Aniq.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.327
But, see, I had to ask myself,

10:18.827 --> 10:23.999
"Self, was there enough time
for someone else to go up those stairs?"

10:24.708 --> 10:26.251
And I said to myself…

10:28.504 --> 10:29.838
"Yes, Self."

10:31.048 --> 10:32.424
You know what? What?

10:32.508 --> 10:35.052
This is really not good cold,
I'm telling you.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.304
-It's been out for a while.
-Almost a full day.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.600
See, Zoë said
that her and Chelsea left the stairs

10:41.683 --> 10:43.977
for about a one-minute window

10:44.061 --> 10:48.357
-to see Aniq flipping out when he woke up.
-Where am I?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.984
-Is that true, Chelsea?
-Yes, that is right.

10:51.068 --> 10:56.240
Now, I listened to five different versions
of that moment.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.909
And in every version,
there were three people

10:58.992 --> 11:01.328
who weren't in the living room
at that time.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.747
It was Walt…

11:03.830 --> 11:06.250
Who, me? Okay.

11:06.917 --> 11:07.918
Maggie…

11:09.670 --> 11:10.671
and Brett.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.425
Now, Maggie was asleep in Brett's car.

11:15.509 --> 11:18.971
So I'm just gonna go ahead and assume

11:19.054 --> 11:21.056
that she's not the killer for now.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.475
Also, she's six, so probably not.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.311
-But then, I was thinking, Walt.
-Hey.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.272
Invisible Walt.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.860
"What way to get remembered?
I don't know." Murder?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.152
Such a provocative word.

11:34.236 --> 11:37.781
Now see, he had enough time to sneak
up them stairs without anybody noticing,

11:37.865 --> 11:40.284
'cause nobody ever notices Walt.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.244
Try my mom?

11:44.788 --> 11:47.457
No. I didn't do it. Those are the facts.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.959
Read 'em… please.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.085
So where was you, Walt?

11:50.878 --> 11:51.920
Where was I?

11:52.004 --> 11:55.549
When everybody else was down here
in the living room, where was you?

11:56.425 --> 11:58.051
-Well, that's--
-I know where you was.

11:58.135 --> 12:02.389
In the foyer bathroom, getting ready
to streak, just like back in high school.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.308
What? How did you know-- Who told you--

12:04.391 --> 12:06.101
It's-- How did you know that?

12:06.727 --> 12:09.396
Well, because Ned
was taking Jenn 1 over there,

12:09.479 --> 12:12.733
and they couldn't get in the restroom
to wash that non-pee out of her hair.

12:12.816 --> 12:16.695
But the bathroom was occupied
with someone dropping a deuce, Officer.

12:17.446 --> 12:20.616
And after I questioned Aniq,
I watched him run into the bathroom

12:20.699 --> 12:22.784
and step over a robe on the floor.

12:22.868 --> 12:27.289
She's right. My first attempt to streak
at a high school party fell flat.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.498
#fail.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.335
So I wanted to do it again
to be remembered,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.921
get naked in front of you guys.
That's when friendships begin.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.924
Occupied.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.929
Here we go.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.477
Someone call 911!

12:49.603 --> 12:50.604
Oh, my God.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.105
Xavier!

12:54.358 --> 12:57.778
So, I thought tonight would be
a second chance to be remembered.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.655
Get y'all to see me naked, and…

12:59.738 --> 13:03.325
All right.
So that leaves two possible people.

13:04.034 --> 13:09.122
Aniq, our original suspect,
who we know went upstairs,

13:10.165 --> 13:14.753
or Brett, who had been missing
until after the body was discovered.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.171
Right.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.966
So who is it? Aniq? Brett?

13:19.049 --> 13:20.467
Brett? Aniq?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.929
I believe I know who the killer is.

13:28.851 --> 13:29.893
Brett.

13:30.686 --> 13:31.728
Oh, my God.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.481
-Oh, my God.
-No. No, no, no. No way. Brett?

13:34.565 --> 13:35.649
Impossible. Brett the 'Vette?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.901
-No way.
-Wait, wait, wait.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.738
He wasn't in the living room.
I remember that very clearly.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.240
It's gotta be Brett.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.617
Jennifer 1! Shut up!

13:45.701 --> 13:48.829
What are you saying?
I have never killed someone.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.165
I don't give a shit about Xavier.
I didn't kill him. I told you!

13:52.249 --> 13:54.626
I was with my daughter in the car.
Bringing her--

13:54.710 --> 13:56.461
No, no, no, boo-boo. Yes, it was you.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.338
Let me tell you
why I think it was you, okay?

13:58.422 --> 14:02.426
'Cause you was mad at Xavier
for macking on Zoë, okay?

14:02.509 --> 14:05.929
You also shoved Aniq
into the shrimp sculpture back there,

14:06.013 --> 14:07.890
-which I think is a bit toxic.
-Separate issue.

14:07.973 --> 14:11.685
-You punched a caterer.
-You don't know what he said to me.

14:11.768 --> 14:15.063
And then you have a history of lying.
You killed Xavier.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.191
-No!
-Look how emotional you are.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.650
'Cause you accuse me of murder!

14:18.734 --> 14:20.194
No. You killed Xavier. Look at you!

14:20.277 --> 14:22.070
Stop saying it or I'll kill you!

14:23.405 --> 14:25.574
If you didn't do it,
you'd be a lot more calm.

14:25.657 --> 14:30.579
I did not kill anyone in this house!

14:30.662 --> 14:32.998
Or any house!

14:33.081 --> 14:34.583
Don't. Don't.

14:34.666 --> 14:35.876
I told you it was Brett.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.128
Something doesn't add up.
You know, the timing's wrong.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.924
When I woke up, I'm pretty sure
I saw Brett heading towards his car.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.842
You're doing this
all off of a "pretty sure"?

14:43.926 --> 14:45.385
I was very disoriented, but…

14:47.304 --> 14:51.558
I noticed that the front door
was open, and there he was. I saw him.

14:52.351 --> 14:55.229
If you admit you saw him,
you're the one who's going to jail.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.564
It's either you or him,
and he can afford a good lawyer.

14:57.648 --> 14:58.732
What, and I should lie?

14:58.815 --> 15:01.860
Zoë, can you please do me a favor
and tell this police officer

15:01.944 --> 15:07.074
that while I am a deeply flawed man,
I am not a murderer? Zoë, tell her.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.909
I-- I…

15:08.992 --> 15:11.578
-What are you doing?
-I…

15:12.371 --> 15:13.622
I…

15:14.373 --> 15:15.707
It wasn't him.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.084
What? Sorry.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.169
When I woke up,
I saw Brett in the driveway.

15:19.253 --> 15:22.089
If that would've been when it had to be,
he couldn't have done it.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.258
Wait, Danner. You just said that it was.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.927
I knew it was Aniq.
Man, I should've been a cop.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.096
So are you confessing?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.682
No. But, you know, I--

15:32.766 --> 15:34.518
I know this doesn't help me to say this,

15:34.601 --> 15:37.813
but I can't let Brett take the fall
when I know the truth.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.231
I thought you hated me.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.609
I did. I kinda didn't like most of you.

15:42.693 --> 15:47.489
But after listening to your stories
all night, it's just-- I realized--

15:47.573 --> 15:50.284
Wait. Were you listening in on us
being questioned?

15:50.367 --> 15:51.827
-What'd you say? What?
-Yeah.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.662
-He was listening to everybody.
-Yeah.

15:53.745 --> 15:54.955
Oh, shit.

15:55.038 --> 15:55.914
-How'd he do that?
-How?

15:55.998 --> 15:59.626
First through the intercom,
then hiding in the recording booth,

15:59.710 --> 16:03.172
and, real slick, through your phone.

16:03.255 --> 16:05.382
-Oh, my God.
-Right?

16:05.465 --> 16:08.510
Okay, yes. I was listening
to you all tell your stories and I--

16:08.594 --> 16:10.179
I know I shouldn't have done that.

16:10.262 --> 16:14.516
But it made me realize that I was wrong.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.894
You know? Yeah.

16:16.977 --> 16:21.565
You know, back in high school, I thought
you were all selfish, judgmental people.

16:21.648 --> 16:26.653
But we all have more in common
than I thought. Even Brett.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.698
Even Xavier.

16:31.617 --> 16:32.910
We all need each other.

16:34.077 --> 16:38.332
Aniq, I did not know you were listening.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.710
I'm really sorry for some things I said.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.794
No, I shouldn't have--

16:42.878 --> 16:43.921
You do not look like

16:44.004 --> 16:46.882
if the dad from Family Matters
and Urkel had a kid somehow.

16:46.965 --> 16:47.966
I missed that one.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.427
I will testify as a character witness
on your behalf.

16:50.511 --> 16:51.553
Yeah.

16:51.637 --> 16:53.263
Brett. Thank you.

16:53.347 --> 16:55.933
But it's too late, you know?

16:56.808 --> 16:57.935
The door's closed.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.440
No, it's not. Door's open.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.236
The closet door.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.904
Took you long enough, puzzle boy.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.531
What is going on?

17:12.824 --> 17:15.577
In every story I heard,
the closet door was closed.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.666
But when I went up there, it was open.

17:23.919 --> 17:24.920
No!

17:25.002 --> 17:27.214
Someone was hiding in the closet.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.467
Yeah. The killer didn't need to go
upstairs during the one-minute window,

17:30.551 --> 17:32.261
because they were already up there.

17:32.344 --> 17:36.139
And you hiding in the recording booth
when I was interviewing Chelsea

17:36.223 --> 17:37.808
helped me figure it out.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.310
Danner, are you saying
that it's neither Brett nor Aniq?

17:40.394 --> 17:43.021
-That's correct.
-But you literally just said it was Brett.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.399
That was a test.
And I knew that Brett didn't do it.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.776
But now I know for sure
that it wasn't Aniq.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.361
Okay, then who is it?

17:50.279 --> 17:53.740
The person that was most upset
with how their life turned out.

17:53.824 --> 17:58.620
The one that told the most cartoonish
and fake story.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.252
Oh, no.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.966
Me? What?

18:12.134 --> 18:14.344
I'm sorry. This little angel?

18:14.428 --> 18:18.015
Yeah. You're the only one
who could have been hiding in the closet.

18:18.557 --> 18:21.727
And you distracted everyone
with your video

18:21.810 --> 18:24.521
so they wouldn't hear Xavier scream
when you killed him.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.982
Five, six, seven!
'Cause the party's never ending…

18:27.816 --> 18:30.027
Where am I? Why am I wet?

18:32.571 --> 18:34.281
This is gonna be fun. So it's my turn now?

18:34.364 --> 18:37.743
Okay, explain how it's me.
Everyone was a witness.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.829
When the video came on,
I was down here with Aniq.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.790
Everyone was witnesses. You're right.

18:43.874 --> 18:45.042
Everyone was a witness,

18:45.125 --> 18:48.587
and all of them said
that you came in from the balcony.

18:49.254 --> 18:50.797
Except for you.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.007
What happened? Are you okay?

18:52.090 --> 18:54.885
I knew it had to be you.
But why would you wanna kill Xavier?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.136
Then I realized

18:56.220 --> 19:00.015
it all started a few months back
when you installed the A/V system.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.684
How you liking that A/V equipment
I installed in your place, huh?

19:02.768 --> 19:06.271
Because I was so flattered
you called an old friend to do the job.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.900
So, you were here in the house all alone,
and Xavier wasn't here.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.694
I'm kind of excited for this.
Everybody else got one. Give me one.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.863
I figure
while you were doing the installation,

19:14.947 --> 19:18.659
you got to snooping around
in Xavier's files,

19:19.159 --> 19:20.410
came across…

19:21.662 --> 19:24.915
track 12, "How Great Is This Party,"
right? That's your line, right?

19:24.998 --> 19:27.167
That is my line. I made it famous, yeah.

19:27.251 --> 19:32.673
You were real bitter towards Xavier
because he became a star, and you weren't.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.716
And that was your line, and he stole it.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.636
Well, that's wrong, because
I wasn't bitter at all. I was psyched.

19:37.719 --> 19:40.722
The dude used my line, right?
We're friends. It's amazing.

19:40.806 --> 19:44.476
He was not your friend.
And you know it, okay?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.271
You felt like--

19:47.354 --> 19:48.355
You all right?

19:48.981 --> 19:51.567
Just giving you a clear path.
You're so confident. I want you to--

19:51.650 --> 19:52.651
-Relax.
-Yep.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.362
See, you wanted to give him
one more chance,

19:55.445 --> 19:57.739
one more chance to help you.

19:57.823 --> 20:01.827
So at the reunion,
you asked him to bless your track.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.829
You're seriously asking me that?

20:03.912 --> 20:05.914
After you dumped me
to start your solo career?

20:05.998 --> 20:07.291
How's that going, by the way?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.501
That's not fair, man.
I gave you your name.

20:09.585 --> 20:11.211
My mom gave me my name.

20:11.295 --> 20:13.505
Fine. Then I came up
with "How Great Is This Party."

20:13.589 --> 20:15.382
-That was my idea.
-What are you talking about?

20:15.465 --> 20:19.094
-Did you look in my private files?
-No, I didn't look at your private files.

20:19.178 --> 20:23.140
"How Great Is This Party" is not yours.
That's just some shit people say.

20:23.223 --> 20:26.351
We are not friends, okay?
You made that clear 15 years ago.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.312
-I made a mistake 15 years ago.
-Stop, stop.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.064
Let me make this very clear, okay?

20:31.148 --> 20:34.651
I will never bless any track of yours.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.987
You're nobody. You're a loser.

20:37.571 --> 20:40.574
I am me. You are my A/V guy.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.868
-I'm not a loser.
-Just keep telling yourself that, man.

20:45.871 --> 20:48.457
Can you just not tell anybody
this happened, please?

20:48.540 --> 20:49.875
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.756
He said no, and you snapped.

20:55.839 --> 20:59.718
So you inspired the song,
but you had no legal right to it.

20:59.801 --> 21:03.722
And there was only one way that you
could get what you felt like you deserve,

21:03.805 --> 21:05.390
and that was to kill him.

21:05.474 --> 21:06.767
-Kill him?
-Yeah.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.102
Kill him, steal the song,

21:09.186 --> 21:11.772
then you say that he gave it to you,

21:11.855 --> 21:14.483
then release the song as a duet

21:14.566 --> 21:17.569
with you and Xavier as your 2Pac.

21:18.278 --> 21:22.407
I mean, this is an incredible,
fanciful imaginary story.

21:22.491 --> 21:26.161
I'm actually impressed,
but it's totally false. It's all made-up.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.747
See, you the one
that been making up stories,

21:28.830 --> 21:32.417
'cause you told Chelsea
that you were in the recording studio.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.128
-That was your alibi.
-I'm about to record a track with Xavier.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.130
I was in the recording studio.

21:37.214 --> 21:42.886
But see, how were you in there
listening to music without it blasting?

21:42.970 --> 21:44.513
Because Maggie went in there first,

21:44.596 --> 21:46.849
and she put the faders
all the way up to ten.

21:47.516 --> 21:49.935
And when I interviewed Aniq,
they were still up there.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.020
And then you said you didn't come out

21:52.104 --> 21:54.606
until after Aniq woke up.

21:54.690 --> 21:57.234
So, how was you listening to a track?

21:58.026 --> 21:59.111
How that work?

22:00.654 --> 22:05.117
You just went in there and took you
one of them alibi selfies and left.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.580
-Have you seen a six-year-old girl?
-No, dude.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.207
But if you stick around,
I'm about to make musical history.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.837
You're making up everything! Aniq,
now's the time you should stand up for me.

22:16.920 --> 22:21.133
See, you needed to get Xavier
in his room alone with you

22:21.216 --> 22:23.010
so you could kill him.

22:23.677 --> 22:26.847
So you snuck upstairs
as the party was dying down…

22:28.098 --> 22:31.268
while everyone thought
you were in the recording studio.

22:31.351 --> 22:35.272
So when he was out on the living room
balcony on the lower level,

22:35.856 --> 22:37.983
you start flicking the lights in his room.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.280
The lights are, like,
flashing in my bedroom.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.532
I should, like--
I should probably check that out,

22:45.616 --> 22:47.409
'cause it might be, like,
a Parasite situation.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.967
But then you heard
Chelsea coming into Xavier's bedroom.

23:06.386 --> 23:08.847
No flashing lights?

23:22.444 --> 23:23.654
It's a fun night, huh?

23:26.490 --> 23:28.659
Jesus. What are you doing?
Why are you here?

23:29.826 --> 23:32.204
-How great is this party?
-You see that?

23:32.287 --> 23:34.164
Five, six, seven!
'Cause the party's never ending

23:34.248 --> 23:37.209
And we're skanking till it's late
Now we're picking up the rhythm…

23:37.292 --> 23:38.293
That was my idea.

23:38.377 --> 23:40.254
That belongs to me.

23:40.337 --> 23:42.881
Your entire fucking career
is because of me.

23:42.965 --> 23:44.758
Okay, I'm turning this shit off.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.886
Why--
You said updating the app would fix it.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.347
What? You want your A/V guy
to help you? Here, come on.

23:51.431 --> 23:54.226
Okay, man.
This is, like, actual Psycho shit.

23:55.644 --> 23:58.772
Fuck. Dude, okay, all right.
Let's just start over, okay? Yasper, wait!

24:09.700 --> 24:10.909
You really think that I did this?

24:11.743 --> 24:14.746
I was Xavier's friend. He was coming up.
We were gonna record a song together.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.248
I have text messages, remember?

24:16.331 --> 24:19.710
He texted me. Look at this.
Look at this. Show everybody.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.421
You know what? Culp helped me
crack this one right here.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.881
-Yes, I did.
-Yeah.

24:23.964 --> 24:26.466
-How so?
-See, I had worked a case

24:26.550 --> 24:28.218
where a husband had killed his wife.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.721
And we was trying to figure out,
how did he get his wife

24:30.804 --> 24:33.724
to come to the front door
just in time for him to kill her?

24:33.807 --> 24:35.392
Well, he texted her!

24:40.564 --> 24:43.108
And then he had the password to her phone,

24:43.192 --> 24:45.152
and he deleted the text.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.738
-You want your A/V guy to help you?
-And you knew Xavier's password,

24:47.821 --> 24:49.323
'cause you set up his A/V.

24:49.406 --> 24:52.868
And after you killed him, you sent
yourself a text from Xavier's phone.

24:52.951 --> 24:56.872
'Cause I'm looking through this,
and he never responds to your texts.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.499
But he just so happens to respond today?

25:00.125 --> 25:05.464
"Track 12 in the WIP folder
should work for our collab."

25:05.547 --> 25:06.840
Yeah, and--

25:06.924 --> 25:08.050
After you sent the text,

25:08.133 --> 25:10.969
you didn't come down the stairs
where people would see you.

25:11.053 --> 25:13.805
Mr. Flippity Gymnast.

25:13.889 --> 25:18.185
What you did was drop 15 feet
off the damn balcony onto this balcony.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.730
-Then you came in here…
-Aniq!

25:21.813 --> 25:24.316
-…just like everyone said.
-Are you okay? What's wrong?

25:24.399 --> 25:25.400
Who did this?

25:25.484 --> 25:28.445
Now, there was only one little snag
in your plan.

25:28.529 --> 25:33.242
Aniq wanted to confront Xavier
and take his ass upstairs, right?

25:33.325 --> 25:34.409
It was Xavier, wasn't it?

25:34.493 --> 25:35.911
And you tried to stop him

25:35.994 --> 25:39.957
because you knew he would be
a number one suspect if he went up there.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.668
All this time,
I thought you were helping me.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.754
I have been helping you.
She's turning you against me right now.

25:45.838 --> 25:47.756
I've been helping you
since the beginning, remember?

25:47.840 --> 25:51.635
She accused you, then she accused Brett,
then this random dude got accused.

25:51.718 --> 25:52.928
Walt!

25:53.011 --> 25:55.097
And now she's accusing me, okay?
So who's next?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.724
Who's the next person she's gonna accuse?

25:57.808 --> 25:59.685
Because the thing
you are lacking right now

25:59.768 --> 26:03.188
is you have these insane theories,
but you have absolutely no evidence!

26:04.314 --> 26:05.315
But there is evidence.

26:05.399 --> 26:08.610
There is a secret hidden camera
in Xavier's bedroom

26:08.694 --> 26:10.988
in the Private Eyes movie poster,
watching you.

26:11.071 --> 26:14.825
You realized there were security cameras
that probably saw exactly what you did.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.451
What are you doing?

26:16.535 --> 26:17.744
You had to erase it.

26:18.871 --> 26:19.955
No, no, no.

26:20.038 --> 26:22.374
Of course!
This is what I was trying to tell you.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.251
You still had Xavier's phone.

26:24.334 --> 26:27.546
I am going to craft a meanly-worded tweet.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.715
You see, your phone has a case on it.

26:29.798 --> 26:32.968
It says "Yasper" in gold letters,
with a dollar sign for an S.

26:33.051 --> 26:36.054
And the phone you had then had no case.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.600
So you used Xavier's phone
to delete the footage

26:39.683 --> 26:41.310
and make Danner look like a screw-up.

26:41.977 --> 26:43.228
I don't screw up.

26:43.312 --> 26:46.690
Okay. You're telling me I killed Xavier,
stole his phone, then just kept it.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.317
To do what with? Why would I have that?

26:50.194 --> 26:52.321
To copy Xavier's song ideas
from his voice memos.

26:53.363 --> 26:56.325
I got over being under you

26:56.408 --> 26:58.952
Zo-o-o-ë

26:59.036 --> 27:00.996
Good acoustics in bathrooms.

27:01.079 --> 27:04.666
You couldn't send the files in an email.
They'd probably check his email records.

27:04.750 --> 27:05.959
We check all that.

27:06.043 --> 27:09.254
So in the shower, I saw you myself.

27:09.922 --> 27:12.883
You were playing them from his phone
and recording them onto your own.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.593
-Yasper? Why are you in the shower?
-Hey.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.428
'Cause the acoustics are unbelievable.
Wanna hear?

27:16.512 --> 27:19.431
I swear to you,
I don't have Xavier's phone.

27:19.515 --> 27:23.310
Like back in the day. Pocket check.
Pocket check! Search his damn pockets.

27:23.393 --> 27:25.646
Gonna search my pockets?
You have a search warrant?

27:25.729 --> 27:27.606
-I don't need…
-You just jump inside someone's pocket?

27:27.689 --> 27:29.066
I don't need a search warrant.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.361
I have two phones. Is that a crime?

27:32.444 --> 27:34.738
One for business, my A/V work,
one for friendship.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.990
And all you guys
are off the friendship one.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.450
It's not Xavier's phone.

27:38.534 --> 27:39.785
Turn the sound on…

27:39.868 --> 27:41.703
-Do it, Culp.
-…and put it back in his pockets.

27:41.787 --> 27:44.122
Y'all wanna have some fun?
I wanna have some fun.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.916
'Cause you trying to play me
like I'm dumb.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.377
Y'all came to a after-party
to have a good time.

27:48.460 --> 27:52.381
It turned into not a good time
because somebody wanna be famous.

27:52.464 --> 27:55.050
So let's go ahead
and turn it into a good time.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.885
What's Xavier's phone number?
Do you have it?

27:59.471 --> 28:01.431
-Let me see that.
-Here you go.

28:03.183 --> 28:05.018
Scrawny little bitch.

28:05.102 --> 28:07.145
-I can't wait. Okay, you guys ready?
-Yep.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.981
All right. Here we go.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.401
She say X marks the G-spot
On her treasure map

28:13.569 --> 28:14.945
Busted!

28:16.196 --> 28:17.573
I knew it!

28:18.448 --> 28:19.700
He did it!

28:19.783 --> 28:21.451
-Yes! Busted!
-Oh, my God.

28:21.535 --> 28:24.454
-I did know it. I called it.
-Nice, babe.

28:24.538 --> 28:26.957
-Nice, babe. That's my wife.
-Bro. Cringe.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.544
You guys don't understand anything.
You don't understand anything.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.754
You all have your own stories, right?

28:33.839 --> 28:35.841
You know, but Xavier, he owed me…

28:36.383 --> 28:37.384
He owed me everything.

28:37.467 --> 28:40.429
I gave him his career.
I gave him his name.

28:40.512 --> 28:44.433
I gave him his name. Do you remember that?
And he still wanted to screw me over.

28:45.684 --> 28:48.770
I should have been the star.
I should have been the successful one.

28:48.854 --> 28:51.148
I was the one
that was supposed to be famous.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.901
And all I was asking was for, like,
a tiny bit of credit.

28:53.984 --> 28:55.652
Just a little bit.
And why is that too much?

28:55.736 --> 28:58.030
Don't I deserve that?
I helped him start the whole thing.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.741
Why shouldn't I be the one
that gets a little bit, no?

29:00.824 --> 29:02.451
But he still wanted to screw me over.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.037
But he wasn't gonna get rich
off of my line. No way.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.873
"How great is this party"
is my fucking line!

29:07.956 --> 29:11.835
It is the perfect encapsulation
of celebratory music! That is mine!

29:13.337 --> 29:15.464
And there's another thing
you guys didn't even think about.

29:15.547 --> 29:16.548
What?

29:17.549 --> 29:19.510
-Move! He's on the run!
-Get him! Get his ass!

29:19.593 --> 29:20.802
Suspect is on foot!

29:22.679 --> 29:24.765
-Oh, my Jesus.
-That's what you get.

29:29.394 --> 29:31.813
Dude,
I never meant for you to take the blame.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.440
That was never part of the plan.

29:33.524 --> 29:36.068
That's why I was trying to help you
put doubt into the air.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.152
Aniq, you're my friend.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.488
A friend wouldn't do this.

29:40.364 --> 29:41.406
Come on. Get up.

29:42.783 --> 29:44.201
I'm sorry, man.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.787
I'll take him out in a sec.

29:48.539 --> 29:49.957
I told you you could trust me.

29:50.040 --> 29:51.583
So, when you falsely accused Brett…

29:51.667 --> 29:55.045
See, I didn't think
you had anything to do with it,

29:55.128 --> 29:59.132
but you were so in cahoots with Yasper,
I just had to make sure.

29:59.216 --> 30:01.677
And besides,
Zoë told me you were a good person,

30:01.760 --> 30:04.471
and if you were pushed,
you would do the right thing.

30:04.555 --> 30:07.641
And I wanted to see
if you would lie to protect yourself.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.143
And you didn't.

30:10.227 --> 30:11.895
Thanks.

30:11.979 --> 30:14.648
You know, I could put a recommendation
in for you at the department

30:14.731 --> 30:18.277
if you ever decide to get into
a career in law enforcement.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.571
You could solve puzzles that save lives.

30:21.655 --> 30:24.992
Thanks. Yeah, it's not really my scene,

30:25.075 --> 30:28.579
but, you know,
if you ever need help solving a case,

30:29.830 --> 30:31.248
here's my card, I think.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.416
I got wet a bunch today.

30:34.168 --> 30:35.335
Cool.

30:35.419 --> 30:36.920
Yep.

30:38.046 --> 30:40.048
Let's go ahead and get him up out of here.

30:40.132 --> 30:44.386
Shit! Is this Jenn 2's amniotic fluid
I keep slipping on?

30:45.387 --> 30:46.597
Nasty!

30:49.474 --> 30:52.227
-Okay, Captain's coming. Captain's here.
-Okay, okay, okay.

30:52.311 --> 30:54.146
Sir, can we get a statement, please?

30:55.397 --> 30:57.816
-I'm a star. Hey!
-Captain…

30:57.900 --> 30:59.776
Hey! Check out my music!

30:59.860 --> 31:04.239
Follow me, @Yazzmatazzsixtynine.
Here's a little glimpse.

31:04.323 --> 31:07.367
Whoa, music boy

31:07.451 --> 31:09.536
Danner, what's going on here?

31:09.620 --> 31:11.079
-Captain, I--
-Hey.

31:11.163 --> 31:14.499
-Aldrin! Good to see you again.
-Mad Dog.

31:14.583 --> 31:15.876
-Yeah.
-Heard you were here.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.252
Still causing trouble, I see.

31:17.336 --> 31:19.588
I'm so sorry. You're too late.

31:19.671 --> 31:22.049
I got our guy. Yeah. Full confession.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.425
No, you didn't.

31:23.509 --> 31:25.385
You took a flight
all the way here from LA?

31:25.469 --> 31:28.263
You might as well just turn around
and get back on that airplane, man.

31:28.347 --> 31:29.765
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you for being

31:29.848 --> 31:31.642
a good team player, champ.

31:34.728 --> 31:37.898
I apologize. I really, truly--

31:37.981 --> 31:40.567
Skape Diem, how great is this party?

31:40.651 --> 31:42.152
Shut the fuck up!

31:42.236 --> 31:45.155
-Captain, I gotta go grab something quick.
-That's fine.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.451
-Sorry, I need to get my…
-How you doing?

31:56.542 --> 31:58.335
Chelsea. Hey.

31:59.586 --> 32:02.714
Listen, I just wanna say I'm really sorry

32:02.798 --> 32:05.384
that I wasn't as nice to you
as I should have been.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.803
It's wild, the anger that you carry.

32:07.886 --> 32:09.263
Pregnancy brain.

32:09.972 --> 32:13.433
Is something you don't have. Babe, it's--
So would you just leave my wife alone?

32:13.517 --> 32:14.726
Yeah. I don't care.

32:15.269 --> 32:16.270
Great.

32:17.771 --> 32:18.772
Friends?

32:20.190 --> 32:21.191
No.

32:23.110 --> 32:24.111
Hey, kiddo.

32:24.194 --> 32:25.279
Daddy!

32:28.824 --> 32:31.451
-See you, Walt.
-Walt? You remembered my name.

32:31.535 --> 32:33.453
After tonight, nobody's gonna forget it.

32:33.954 --> 32:36.039
-Walt.
-Yes, Walt.

32:36.832 --> 32:37.833
Walt.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.793
It's my birthday.

32:45.007 --> 32:47.217
Happy birthday, Walt.

32:47.301 --> 32:49.595
Do you wanna get breakfast?

32:49.678 --> 32:52.764
-You know, Yasper's rental still has a--
-Yeah, I do.

32:52.848 --> 32:55.267
Just taking this back to the lab.
It's evidence.

32:56.185 --> 32:58.687
Thought it was a gift. It's my-- Yeah.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.105
Bye, Mags.

33:00.814 --> 33:01.815
Sorry.

33:01.899 --> 33:04.902
-Hey, can I drive?
-Yeah.

33:04.985 --> 33:06.778
All right, let's do it. Ready?

33:09.531 --> 33:12.201
So, Mommy and the silly man
are friends now?

33:12.284 --> 33:13.285
Yeah.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.369
I like him.

33:14.453 --> 33:16.413
He's not as cool as your dad, right?

33:18.373 --> 33:20.000
Now is when you say, "No way."

33:20.542 --> 33:22.711
-No way.
-Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

33:31.512 --> 33:34.806
Okay. I'm just gonna
pull over here for a second.

33:38.435 --> 33:41.104
-Okay.
-So what, is this as far as we go?

33:41.188 --> 33:42.189
Yep.

33:42.272 --> 33:45.275
-Get out.
-Out? Well, then I guess so.

33:45.359 --> 33:46.360
-It's been--
-Nice knowing ya.

33:46.443 --> 33:48.445
-Nice knowing ya?
-Oh, my God.

33:48.529 --> 33:49.863
This has been a crazy night.

33:49.947 --> 33:53.534
It has been a crazy night, but…

33:54.743 --> 33:55.744
here we are.

33:56.453 --> 33:58.622
And the music's playing,

33:58.705 --> 34:01.166
and we are all alone,

34:01.250 --> 34:06.171
and I'm just wondering
if you are ever gonna make that move?

34:08.172 --> 34:12.844
I mean, ye-- I mean, I want to.
But just, someone died tonight, you know.

34:12.928 --> 34:14.763
-Yeah.
-Somebody else went to jail.

34:14.847 --> 34:16.264
Sure.

34:16.348 --> 34:18.391
Just didn't seem like
a real aphrodisiac, you know.

34:18.475 --> 34:19.476
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.728
But, you know…

34:23.480 --> 34:25.899
Just-- So maybe, like,
in a couple of weeks or something

34:25.983 --> 34:27.860
when things are a little less intense,
we could--

34:43.292 --> 34:44.585
Hey. Walt.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.253
Sorry to interrupt.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.839
Would you mind dropping me off
at home first, or…
