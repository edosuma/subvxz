<i>Ten of the best tattoo artists</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:04.921

00:07.215 --> 00:08.842

[announcer] <i> On the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Ink Master <i> ,</i>

00:11.511 --> 00:13.972
<i>seven artists were left</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

00:14.055 --> 00:15.390
<i>Each week,</i>
<i>we've been testing you</i>

00:15.473 --> 00:18.101
<i>on the essential skills</i>

[announcer] <i> The artists'</i>
<i>technical precision skills</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.731
were put to the test
in the <i> Flash Challenge.</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:24.399
This is gonna suck.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.609
There's one artist
who stood out--

00:26.693 --> 00:28.027
{\an5}-Josh.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.027
-[applause]

00:28.111 --> 00:29.988
Come on, man.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.782
And go around and critique it,
and say this is based on

00:32.866 --> 00:34.909
{\an5}-"bold solid color."

00:32.866 --> 00:34.909
-Yeah.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.536
So then I would have
[bleep] done that,

00:36.619 --> 00:38.413
instead of wasting an hour
doing the most precise [bleep]

00:38.496 --> 00:39.497
[bleep] I've ever seen on a...

00:39.581 --> 00:41.416
I was pissed as [bleep].

00:42.625 --> 00:43.960
[announcer]
<i>In the elimination tattoo,</i>

00:44.043 --> 00:46.254
<i>Shane set out</i>
<i>to prove a point...</i>

00:46.337 --> 00:47.714
I'm such a [bleep] badass

00:47.797 --> 00:48.631
that even if
I reduce my quality,

00:48.715 --> 00:51.301
it's still better
than everybody else.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.469
[announcer]
<i>But is outdone</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:53.887
<i>by Lea's snow leopard.</i>

00:53.970 --> 00:56.139
This is absolutely
unbelievable.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.476
[bleep] pissed off, dude.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.060
Lea's getting the praise
like that.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.854
Dude, that tattoo's
[bleep] easy.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.272
[announcer]
<i>At the elimination,</i>

01:05.355 --> 01:06.900
<i>Bili, Josh, and Heather</i>

01:06.983 --> 01:09.694
{\an5}<i>-were the bottom three.</i>

01:06.983 --> 01:09.694
-Bili--

01:09.778 --> 01:10.862
in terms
of what the challenge was--

01:10.945 --> 01:13.907
photo-realism--
I just think it missed its Mark.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.991
{\an5}-Josh.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.991
-This tattoo

01:15.074 --> 01:18.077
looks more like
a pop-art painting.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.830
If we took a photograph,
that wouldn't be

01:20.914 --> 01:22.081
the way
the photograph would be,

01:22.165 --> 01:23.875
and it was based
on photo-realism.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.418
It just didn't hit the Mark.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.463
Heather.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.881
The tattoo
doesn't come even close

01:29.964 --> 01:31.090
to being photo-realistic.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.343
You've been through
some rough critiques.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.969
This one's going
to get it again.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.180
I want to see competition.
I want to see a star.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.892
I want to see somebody shine.
I haven't seen it.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.895
Heather, you don't have
what it takes to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

01:45.897 --> 01:47.607
[announcer]
<i>Six artists remain.</i>

01:47.690 --> 01:51.444
<i>But only one will earn</i>
<i>a $100,000 prize</i>

01:51.528 --> 01:53.863
<i>and the title of</i> Ink Master <i> .</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:56.199
[rock music]

02:32.819 --> 02:36.489
[rock music]

02:42.120 --> 02:44.163
{\an5}-What happened?

02:42.120 --> 02:44.163
-They tore us up.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.249
They said that his
wasn't realistic.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.793
I was like,
"why the [bleep] am I here?"

02:48.877 --> 02:51.004
I don't think
that anybody can say

02:51.087 --> 02:52.672
that the strawberry
doesn't look like a strawberry.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.632
It's just the proportions
and everything

02:54.716 --> 02:56.426
to make it photo-realistic--

02:56.509 --> 02:57.677
it just didn't hit the mark.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.928
{\an1}He shouldn't even
have been up there.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.388
That was a badass
[bleep] sleeve, you know?

03:00.471 --> 03:01.514
They seemed
to really be gunning

03:01.598 --> 03:03.016
to get rid of me and Bili.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.976
{\an8}<i>I think they're out</i>
<i>to get me on this one</i> .

03:05.059 --> 03:06.686
{\an8}I actually have done
black and gray now.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.062
{\an8}I've done color.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.772
{\an8}<i>All these critiques</i>
<i>hammered me away.</i>

03:09.856 --> 03:13.151
{\an8}Meanwhile, Shane hasn't touched
any color since he's been here.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.321
You've never done color
since you're here.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.073
{\an5}-I haven't had to.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.073
-At this point, it's $100,000.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.241
He's been in his
[bleep] comfort zone

03:20.325 --> 03:23.578
the whole time he's been here--
hasn't gone up once.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.704
Why hasn't he gone up?

03:25.914 --> 03:28.917
You do black and gray every
[bleep] tattoo you've done.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.335
What are you going to do?
[bleep] fight me?

03:31.794 --> 03:33.087
{\an5}-Game on.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.087
-[Bleep].

03:43.431 --> 03:45.683
You guys are all one step
closer to that 100 grand,

03:45.767 --> 03:47.143
the write up
in <i> Ink</i> magazine,

03:47.226 --> 03:49.228
and, most importantly,
the title of <i> Ink Master</i> .

03:50.563 --> 03:52.482
As always, we begin
with the <i> Flash Challenge.</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:53.983
The winner will get first pick
of the human canvas

03:54.067 --> 03:55.944
for the elimination tattoo.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.403
This week's challenge--
color.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.242
<i>Colors are super important</i>
<i>in tattoos.</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:04.494
{\an8}That's what makes the tattoo
so bright and so beautiful.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.830
<i>With a minimal understanding</i>
<i>of complementary colors,</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:09.791
<i>you could really make a tattoo</i>
<i>bounce off the body.</i>

04:09.874 --> 04:12.043
Bright colors
really make your designs pop.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.252
In color tattoos,

04:13.336 --> 04:14.671
you need to have
technical skills.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.382
{\an8}It's a lot more difficult to
saturate the color in the skin.

04:17.464 --> 04:18.382
It's very easy to screw up.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.052
As always, you'll be judged
by Oliver Peck,

04:21.135 --> 04:22.595
Chris Nunez, and myself.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.681
We also have
a very special guest.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.265
As the owner of Saved Tattoos,

04:26.349 --> 04:27.850
he's one of the most
in-demand artists in the world.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.269
His clientele includes everyone

04:30.353 --> 04:32.271
from hard-core tattoo
enthusiasts

04:32.355 --> 04:33.690
to rock stars
and celebrities--

04:33.773 --> 04:35.942
Scott Campbell.

04:36.025 --> 04:40.780
[applause]

04:40.863 --> 04:42.240
{\an8}I have a tattoo shop
in Brooklyn.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.616
{\an8}It's kind of grown to be

04:43.700 --> 04:44.617
<i>a pretty important shop</i>
<i>in New York.</i>

04:44.701 --> 04:46.369
<i>We have established</i>
<i>this clientele</i>

04:46.452 --> 04:48.538
<i>of the New York</i>
<i>creative elite.</i>

04:48.621 --> 04:50.081
<i>There's a whole</i>
<i>celebrity roster.</i>

04:50.164 --> 04:52.250
<i>Getting to work with people</i>
<i>in different creative fields,</i>

04:52.333 --> 04:54.127
<i>it's given me a really</i>
<i>interesting perspective</i>

04:54.210 --> 04:54.377
<i>on the whole industry.</i>

04:57.422 --> 04:58.548
So, Scott, we're testing
color skills today.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.426
What are some of the biggest
mistakes that artists make?

05:01.509 --> 05:04.345
The main goal with color
is to get as much pigment

05:04.429 --> 05:05.596
under the skin as you can,

05:05.680 --> 05:06.889
with as minimal trauma
as possible.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.391
You see young tattoo artists--

05:08.474 --> 05:09.726
they'll be putting color in

05:09.809 --> 05:12.145
and they'll really overwork
the skin, and it'll scar up

05:12.228 --> 05:13.396
or turn into hamburger
while it's healing.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.148
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Cool, man. Thank you.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.817
Alright,
let's meet your canvases.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.782
[rock music]

05:28.036 --> 05:29.912
<i>What the hell?</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:30.955
{\an8}There's a bunch
of amputees showing up.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.331
{\an8}I guess I'm tattooing a stump.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.377
As you can imagine,
losing a limb

05:36.461 --> 05:39.130
is a traumatic experience.
Many amputees express themselves

05:39.213 --> 05:40.590
by applying a design
to their prosthesis.

05:40.673 --> 05:44.010
In this challenge, you'll
be using your color skills

05:44.093 --> 05:47.096
to create a piece that reflects
the personality of your canvas.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.931
Oh, my God.
This is intense.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.266
I don't know about this.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.351
{\an8}I hope I'm not gonna
[bleep] it up.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.353
Jeffrey, you're going
to be with Lea.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.189
Michael, you're going
to be with Tommy.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.775
Krishna, you're going
to be with James.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.526
I've painted
on prosthetics before.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.612
Everybody wants artwork
for their body, you know,

06:02.695 --> 06:04.614
{\an8}whether it's on a prosthetic
or whether it's a tattoo.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.407
Paul, you're working
with Shane today.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.493
{\an8}I know these legs
are expensive, but I'm pissed.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.328
{\an8}I should have won
a flash challenge by now.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.580
And this is the one--
I'm taking this challenge.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.916
Robert, you're going
to be working with Bili.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.793
I've never really worked
with a prosthetic before.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.461
{\an8}We do a bad job,
they're kind of screwed.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.838
Joe, you'll be with Josh.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.090
You have two hours to paint.

06:22.173 --> 06:22.423
The clock starts now.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.345
How did that happen?

06:27.428 --> 06:29.305
Had a car accident
four years ago.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.306
Oh, [bleep].

06:30.389 --> 06:31.641
I'm a shark attack survivor.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.309
I had to actually fight a shark
to get away,

06:33.392 --> 06:35.978
{\an5}-and swim back to land.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.978
-Oh, wow.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.774
Anything with a shark,
water, ocean, would be cool.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.359
This is not
making me happy at all.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.152
{\an8}I'm dealing
with a shark that's gray.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.196
But I've come way too far now
to be laying down.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.448
I would like a dragon tattoo,

06:47.532 --> 06:48.241
since it already looks
like an animal's head.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.367
I'm thinking
three-dimension.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.828
We paint
the whole entire prosthetic,

06:51.911 --> 06:52.954
{\an8}not just something stamped
on the side.

06:53.037 --> 06:56.666
It really has that shape,
like, the cheekbones--

06:56.749 --> 06:57.667
Yeah, we can put the eyes
right here,

06:57.750 --> 07:00.086
and everything else
just falls into place.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.337
In my head, it's done.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.589
Oh, that's
a good [bleep] idea, dude.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.429
{\an5}-Holy, [bleep].

07:08.511 --> 07:10.429
-Can I hold this?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.682
{\an5}-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.682
{\an3}-[laughs]

07:12.765 --> 07:15.143
{\an5}-This is incredible, bro.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.143
-You do your thing,

07:15.226 --> 07:16.936
{\an5}-and make it hot, you know.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.936
-Yeah.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.980
{\an5}-How'd it happen?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.980
-Oh, I was on a dairy farm.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.274
Very bottom shoelace
got caught in a, uh,

07:21.357 --> 07:22.191
one of the machines
up in the silo.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.485
{\an5}-Really.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.485
-Yeah, it was mangled up,

07:24.569 --> 07:26.445
it was twisted around real bad.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.698
I was up there for about an hour
before it shut off.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.532
You didn't pass out at all?

07:29.615 --> 07:30.533
Oh, no.
I had to fight the machine

07:30.616 --> 07:33.077
{\an5}-or else it would have eaten me.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.077
{\an3}-Wow, man.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.829
Motorcycle accident.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.205
Ended up hitting something
on the road,

07:36.289 --> 07:37.748
spun out, hit the guardrail.
I sat up,

07:37.832 --> 07:39.375
I took off my gloves
and my helmet.

07:39.458 --> 07:40.042
One of my friends ran over.
I said, "My leg's down there--

07:40.126 --> 07:42.044
{\an5}-go get it."

07:40.126 --> 07:42.044
-Crazy.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.380
So is it--
expensive as hell, isn't it?

07:44.839 --> 07:45.923
It was 95,000.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.050
{\an5}-What?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.050
-Yeah.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.929
{\an5}-95,000. [bleep].

07:48.134 --> 07:51.929
-Yeah.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.313
{\an8}Color tattooing is
obviously a big part of the game

08:00.396 --> 08:01.731
{\an8}for us as tattooers.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.150
{\an8}I like to see people use color
in a way that makes it pop,

08:04.233 --> 08:06.485
makes it jump off the skin.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.445
Looking at the work
you do on the wall,

08:07.528 --> 08:08.946
I can tell you like colors.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.074
Colors are awesome.
Gonna use every color they got.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.242
{\an8}Color's what I do best.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.912
<i>I'm gonna try to use</i>
<i>as many colors as I can,</i>

08:15.995 --> 08:17.413
<i>by using the color wheel,</i>

08:17.496 --> 08:20.249
<i>creating a warm and cold</i>
<i>bouncing off of each other,</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:21.584
<i>really make it look</i>
<i>like a sticker.</i>

08:21.667 --> 08:23.044
Just looks sick like that.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.257
Alright, guys.
30 minutes left.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.719
We're all here just trying
to do our best work.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.221
And whoever
does the best work

08:33.304 --> 08:34.804
deserves to win,
and that's it.

08:34.889 --> 08:35.890
Everybody's trying
to be the <i> Ink Master</i> , basicall.

08:35.972 --> 08:37.642
Yeah.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.395
I'm going to show off
my color skills

08:41.479 --> 08:42.270
by trying to paint
with complementary colors,

08:42.355 --> 08:44.607
'cause the prosthetic
is so dark--

08:44.690 --> 08:46.609
{\an8}I gotta do something
to make everything jump off.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.778
So you're real Brooklyn--
straight up?

08:48.861 --> 08:49.779
So I'm going to do
the Brooklyn bridge in oranges,

08:49.862 --> 08:52.198
and then I'll do the background
in cool colors.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.407
So hopefully it pops
that bridge off.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.533
Definitely happening.
Yeah, man.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.828
I'm holding your leg,
like, super sturdy,

08:57.912 --> 08:59.538
like, as if I was tattooing,
you know.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.457
You got such a nice,
steady flow

09:01.540 --> 09:03.042
for being under pressure
like this.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.460
I have to, man.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.964
My life depends on it.
Ah, this is pressure, man.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.801
[rock music]

09:16.055 --> 09:18.307
Can't see anybody having nicer
colors than you right now.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.686
[bleep] Judges have been
hard as [bleep] on me, man.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.895
Guess sometimes, when
you have the cream of the crop,

09:22.979 --> 09:26.732
{\an5}-you have to be hardest on them.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.732
-I ain't here to lose.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.984
I want to win.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.194
Like to win one of
these [bleep] Flash Challenges.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.405
{\an8}I'm going to use bright colors
to prove a point here.

09:32.488 --> 09:33.572
{\an8}I'm sure I'm going
to shock a couple people.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.826
30 seconds.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.121
[intense music]

09:44.417 --> 09:45.501
That's it.
Time's up.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.419
Brushes down.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.504
{\an5}-Brushes down, man.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.504
-That's it.

09:48.587 --> 09:52.008
{\an5}-This is sick, bro.

09:48.587 --> 09:52.008
-That is awesome.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.010
It flows, it goes

09:54.093 --> 09:57.305
{\an8}just the same way it would
if I did a tattoo on his skin.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.015
It's beautiful.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.100
{\an5}-That is amazing.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.100
-Thank you.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.268
I'm gonna win it.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.271
Well, let's take a look.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.856
{\an5}-What are your thoughts?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.856
-It's phenomenal.

10:06.939 --> 10:07.690
I can't even put it into words.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.525
She hit it
right on the head, man.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.694
I used the base of,
like, purple and yellow.

10:11.777 --> 10:16.073
And I put a little bit
of red and green.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.491
The choice of colors
is interesting too,

10:17.575 --> 10:18.701
'cause it's not
your standard palette--

10:18.784 --> 10:21.871
slight complementary colors
that go together.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.706
{\an5}-It looks like a tattoo.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.706
-Yeah, it really does.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.665
That's actually what we were
kind of going for.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.044
James, let's take a look
at this.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.545
Yes, I was like,
"How am I going

10:29.628 --> 10:31.922
to do a gray shark
and show color?"

10:32.006 --> 10:34.133
So I had to do a lot
of other elements

10:34.216 --> 10:35.217
to help it out a little bit.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.302
Got to have the background
to add color.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.553
Brought that dimension in.
Looks good.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.805
Beautiful shading
in the mouth here.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.683
I also like how you got darker
down in the bottom,

10:42.767 --> 10:44.310
{\an5}-'cause of the depth.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.310
-Yeah, I like the light

10:44.393 --> 10:46.312
from the top shallow water.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.313
Nice.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.441
Bili, what I like about this

10:50.524 --> 10:52.193
is that it looks like
street art.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.153
The green is just popping.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.072
The limited use of color
really makes it pop

10:56.155 --> 10:58.741
{\an5}-on that black background.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.741
-And the detail

10:58.824 --> 10:58.866
on the mic is great.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.744
Josh, that's definitely

11:01.827 --> 11:04.955
a "Josh Woods" piece
of art right there.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.582
I was amazed
to watch him make the color.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.084
So many different shades
of blue,

11:08.167 --> 11:09.251
so many different shades
of purple.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.170
Well, this is the color guy
around here.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.255
Color-- I mean,
he's checking all the boxes.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.965
You got Roy G. Biv.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.133
{\an5}-It's nice and vibrant.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.133
-The use

11:16.217 --> 11:18.719
of cool and warm colors
bouncing off each other

11:18.803 --> 11:19.678
makes it really stand out.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.305
Josh's leg is
not what I'm into.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.765
It's fourth-grader style
drawing.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.767
{\an8}It's a color challenge,
but that doesn't mean

11:24.850 --> 11:26.602
{\an8}you have to use every
color in the color wheel.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.398
Tommy, Brooklyn Bridge.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.108
Man, I like the bridge.
It stands out good.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.069
It's bright in the foreground,
but then if you look close

11:35.152 --> 11:36.570
you see the dark-shadowed
buildings in the background.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.906
It has a really distinct
mood to it.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.199
You know, they were focusing
on color.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.992
It's nice to see
a little bit of restraint.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.454
Shane, why the dragon?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.081
Well, I came home
from the hospital--

11:47.164 --> 11:48.666
my son was five at the time--

11:48.749 --> 11:51.043
and he saw it, and he said,
"Oh, it looks like a dragon."

11:51.127 --> 11:52.545
{\an5}-And was okay with it.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.545
-Oh, wow.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.796
That's great.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.256
Well, one of the things
that's impressing me

11:55.339 --> 11:56.632
the most about this, Shane--

11:56.715 --> 11:58.384
you took the prosthesis,
and you made

11:58.467 --> 12:01.053
a three-dimensional piece
out of it.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.638
Look at those teeth, man.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.598
Great use of the shape.
You used the whole thing.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.516
That was the kicker there.
Lots of bright color.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.018
{\an5}-Good job.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.018
-Shane only used,

12:08.102 --> 12:10.813
{\an8}like, two colors,
so I think I got a good chance.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.024
I'm definitely feeling
extra confident.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.110
{\an8}My client wants
way too much.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.653
I cannot finish.
This is brutal.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.238
The whole composition
of this tattoo

12:19.321 --> 12:21.615
is just painful to me.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.162
It's pretty obvious
who won this thing.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.581
Lea, right?

12:28.664 --> 12:31.333
It's definitely
my favorite artistic piece.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.626
{\an5}-Totally, I agree.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.626
-Wait, Lea?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.087
{\an5}-I thought we were with Shane.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.087
-That was a quick bust-out.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.172
He had no hesitation.
He went in

12:36.255 --> 12:39.175
{\an5}-and he got the job done.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.175
-And the whole thing

12:39.258 --> 12:41.093
was about bringing out
the personality.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.596
{\an5}-That's how his son made peace.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.596
-That was cool.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.347
So that's one for Lea,
two for Lea.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.892
Not Lea, dude.
I would have had Bili's.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.310
For me, I would have
picked the punk rock one.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.730
Alright, so let's do this.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.274
This <i> Flash Challenge</i> was about
testing your color skills

12:55.357 --> 12:57.735
by creating a perfect design
for a prosthesis.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.321
The one artist
we feel won this challenge...

13:01.447 --> 13:03.073
And has the first choice

13:03.157 --> 13:04.783
of the human canvas for
tonight's elimination tattoo...

13:11.415 --> 13:14.919
{\an5}-Is Shane.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.919
-[applause]

13:15.002 --> 13:16.712
I'm psyched that I won
the flash challenge.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.922
{\an8}And it was a
color challenge,

13:18.005 --> 13:19.006
{\an8}and that, I'm sure,
shocked a few people.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.884
I'm confident doing color,
but I'm really happy

13:21.967 --> 13:23.886
to have choice of canvas
in the next round.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.388
Between the green
and little bit of the purple

13:26.472 --> 13:27.556
that you used
with the bright white eyes,

13:27.640 --> 13:30.059
{\an5}-it really made the piece pop.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.059
-Well done, Shane.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.604
Shane's able to tackle each
of the challenges really well,

13:33.687 --> 13:34.897
{\an8}and I think
he's starting to shine

13:34.980 --> 13:36.482
{\an8}and he's going
to be heavy competition.

13:36.565 --> 13:37.525
So I got a lot to work on.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.401
You guys can all head back
to the brownstone.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.278
It's annoying.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.114
{\an8}I feel like Shane
is the big favorite.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.408
I feel like I've been doing good
in the Flash Challenges,

13:46.492 --> 13:49.328
the last ones,
but they never let me win.

13:52.831 --> 13:56.460
I don't know what
the [bleep] else I can do.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.753
They're going to rip it apart
no matter how good it is.

13:57.836 --> 14:00.631
Just keep doing your thing.
You're still here.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.758
{\an8}I used every color
on the palette.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.343
Shane used two.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.678
They're not going
to rip Shane apart

14:05.761 --> 14:07.930
no matter if he takes
a [bleep] on his leg,

14:08.013 --> 14:09.265
or if he does a great tattoo.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.058
I'm definitely pissed off.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.561
Shane's going to do
a huge black and gray piece,

14:13.644 --> 14:15.312
and, like, color the pupils
in red, and they'll be, like,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.982
"That's a great use
of color, man."

14:18.065 --> 14:19.233
Just praise him on it.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.610
Think I've been praised
sometime when I shouldn't have?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.571
They just don't ever say
anything negative.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.114
We gotta knock him
off his high horse.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.074
I'm motivated.
I'm ready to try

14:27.157 --> 14:28.200
to win this whole event.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.079
[needle buzzes]

14:36.208 --> 14:36.959
For your elimination tattoo,

14:37.042 --> 14:37.960
you'll be using
your color skills

14:38.043 --> 14:41.088
to create an American
traditional tattoo.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.092
This style became popular during
the turn of the 18th century

14:45.175 --> 14:48.137
by sailors who would frequent
the tattoo shops.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.638
{\an8}With American
traditional,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.057
{\an8}it's very simplified, and,
like, the line work's very big

14:52.141 --> 14:53.726
{\an8}and the shading's
very dark.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.061
These pieces used to be done
with very little color.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.814
But over the years,
the American traditional tattoo

14:58.897 --> 15:01.400
has evolved into
a technicolor style all its own.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.152
{\an8}A great
American traditional tattoo

15:03.235 --> 15:06.071
{\an8}should have a lot of
black, very clean outlines,

15:06.155 --> 15:08.282
bright colors
with a limited palette.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.742
This was all
I was able to tattoo

15:09.825 --> 15:11.327
for the first year of my career,

15:11.410 --> 15:12.661
so I'm going to be good at this.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.331
Let's meet your canvases.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.756
Shane, because you won
the flash challenge,

15:23.839 --> 15:25.883
you get first pick
of the human canvases.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.428
{\an8}Everybody here
in the competition

15:29.511 --> 15:30.971
{\an8}thinks that I just do
black and gray,

15:31.055 --> 15:32.097
{\an8}but I'm fully confident
in colors.

15:32.181 --> 15:35.893
{\an5}-What was your idea, dude?

15:32.181 --> 15:35.893
-Skull, top hat, dagger.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.771
{\an8}Shane is struggling
with this one,

15:38.854 --> 15:41.106
{\an8}because he didn't get brought up
doing this style of work.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.442
But, hey,
that's good news for me.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.526
What were you looking for?

15:44.610 --> 15:47.071
A hand with an eye in it.
Back of my arm.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.115
Some of their ideas weren't
really very traditional ideas.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.368
{\an5}-What's your idea?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.368
-I want to get

15:52.451 --> 15:55.496
the traditional skull,
snake, dagger.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.248
I like to work on calf skin.
It takes the color very well.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.459
And his idea's
very traditional.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.670
Think I'm going to go with
the skull, dagger and snake.

16:04.922 --> 16:05.923
The rest of the human canvases
will, one by one,

16:06.006 --> 16:08.592
pick a skull
that has your name on it.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.178
The canvas that draws your name
will be your client.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.012
Come on up
and make a selection.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.015
Josh.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.477
Lea.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.186
Tommy.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.731
James.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.982
Mike, come on up
and choose the final skull.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.236
Bill.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.780
You have the rest
of the afternoon

16:29.863 --> 16:31.281
to talk with your canvas.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.534
Tomorrow you'll have five hours
to tattoo.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.411
Good luck, everyone.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.580
{\an8}American
traditional tattooing

16:38.664 --> 16:40.624
{\an8}is the foundation
of American tattoos.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.626
Not so much
just specific imagery

16:42.710 --> 16:44.420
like eagles
and daggers and skulls,

16:44.503 --> 16:46.922
but it's also become
a certain style--

16:47.005 --> 16:49.758
bold, colorful,
simple designs.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.927
But just 'cause it's simple
doesn't mean it's easy.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.053
I see you got black and gray,

16:53.137 --> 16:54.805
but I'm going to have
to do color, right?

16:54.888 --> 16:56.432
{\an5}-I want color.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.432
-Okay, okay.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.142
<i>♪ Da-da-doo ♪</i>

16:58.225 --> 17:00.769
I don't know where there's
a lighthouse on here.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.605
As long as it signifies--
gets the whole purpose across

17:03.689 --> 17:05.523
that it's the light
looking over the darkness.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.942
When they say
traditional tattoo,

17:07.025 --> 17:08.944
I have to do, like,
a single bold line--

17:09.028 --> 17:11.989
like, four colors--
like, very simple.

17:12.071 --> 17:13.365
You know what I mean?

17:13.449 --> 17:14.616
I'm really bummed right now.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.702
{\an8}Being that American
traditional tattoos were done

17:16.785 --> 17:17.994
with five or
six colors only,

17:18.078 --> 17:19.663
ultimately, I feel
that it's a cop out.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.165
Super simple...

17:22.249 --> 17:23.250
Which is, like,
the hardest thing for me.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.002
I make tattoos as complex
as I can make them.

17:25.085 --> 17:28.172
I've spent a lot of years
working on color blends,

17:28.255 --> 17:30.424
and this is really
taking things backwards.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.970
I like the pirate ship.

17:35.053 --> 17:36.430
I should have been a pirate,
you know.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.640
I should have been born
in those eras, in the 1800s.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.601
{\an8}My client has
a sleeve of water

17:40.684 --> 17:43.937
and a sleeve of fire.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.815
And he wants to connect
both sleeve

17:46.899 --> 17:50.319
with a pirate ship.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.154
I'm thinking a kraken--

17:52.237 --> 17:55.282
a big, giant squid
coming this way,

17:55.365 --> 17:57.034
and a pirate ship
coming in here.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.535
I like the kraken.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.413
It's a lot of work.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.956
Go big or go home.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.334
My client wants way too much.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.837
In the amount of time
that I have,

18:08.921 --> 18:10.422
it's not going to happen.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.341
This is a lot of pressure.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.468
This is brutal.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.385
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.096
I have to finish.
I can't not finish.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.484
How you feeling, Lea?

18:30.567 --> 18:31.944
{\an5}[clicks tongue]

18:30.567 --> 18:31.944
Uh, how am I feeling?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.779
I'm not feeling too hot today.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.531
{\an5}-Uh-oh.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.531
-You get your [bleep] done?

18:35.614 --> 18:38.784
Yeah, but I don't like it.
I'd like to redraw it.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.161
He wants this giant squid
battling the pirate ship,

18:41.245 --> 18:43.831
so there's nothing small
I can do with that.

18:43.914 --> 18:46.458
Did you try talking
to the dude?

18:46.542 --> 18:47.417
Explain to him,
"I spent all night

18:47.501 --> 18:48.752
"on this [bleep] drawing.
It's not at all

18:48.836 --> 18:50.796
what I'm thinking.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.464
It's too much.
We gotta do something else."

18:52.548 --> 18:57.386
"There's $100,000 on the line,
and you need to work with me."

18:57.469 --> 18:58.470
It's as simple as that.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.806
I know with this piece,
I'm going to go home.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.932
{\an8}I think Lea's at the end
of her rope.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.560
<i>Your time has come.</i>
<i>Time for her to move on.</i>

19:09.147 --> 19:11.066
Morning, it's time
to use your color skills

19:11.149 --> 19:13.569
to create an American
traditional tattoo.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.571
The judges will be looking
for your use of color

19:15.654 --> 19:18.448
and how true you stayed to
the American traditional style.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.617
You have five hours
to complete your design.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.579
And the clock starts now.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.584
{\an8}American traditional
tattooing is my main specialty.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.793
{\an8}It's what I'm
most known for.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.379
So in judging these
American traditional tattoos

19:32.462 --> 19:34.464
I'm looking
for clean, solid lines,

19:34.548 --> 19:37.009
good, solid blacks,
smooth shading,

19:37.092 --> 19:39.177
and, most importantly,
solid bright color.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.098
Basically, the traditional--
what they're looking for--

19:43.182 --> 19:44.516
is like this.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.226
Yeah, it almost looks
more, like, animated.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.771
It's pretty far off
from what we had yesterday.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.356
Well, not really.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.318
I just--
I don't know.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.737
I'm not feeling it
the way this is.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.195
I don't want that on me.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.867
[sighs]
Well, tell me something now,

20:01.950 --> 20:03.118
{\an5}-'cause I've got 15 minutes.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.118
-I know.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.829
I'm just not--
I don't like how it's centered.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.998
It's just too, like,
animated.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.708
[Bleep] me.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.544
{\an8}She wants it totally
different than what I've drawn.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.296
[Bleep].

20:15.881 --> 20:17.966
I am not too happy.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.803
{\an8}James has come up with
a more masculine lighthouse,

20:21.887 --> 20:24.681
a very large one,
and I had something

20:24.765 --> 20:29.269
{\an5}-more refined in mind.

20:24.765 --> 20:29.269
-This is [bleep] insane now.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.188
I am under the gun right now,

20:31.271 --> 20:33.815
and I am about to go crazy.

20:33.899 --> 20:34.441
[Bleep] me.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.778
Soon as I saw
that sketch,

20:37.861 --> 20:40.405
I was like,
"Yeah, this is it. Awesome."

20:42.908 --> 20:43.784
I'm loving it.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.328
Outstanding!

20:46.411 --> 20:47.204
{\an8}I'm going to have to do

20:47.287 --> 20:49.873
{\an8}the kraken
attacking the pirate ship.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.208
Can't waste any time.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.042
<i>I cannot do</i>
<i>just a pirate ship.</i>

20:52.125 --> 20:55.504
<i>I cannot do just the kraken.</i>

20:55.587 --> 20:59.007
<i>To tattoo it, it's going</i>
<i>to be really, really tough,</i>

20:59.091 --> 20:59.675
<i>and it's going to be pushing it.</i>

20:59.758 --> 21:03.345
[needle buzzes]

21:05.931 --> 21:07.474
[Bleep] me.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.394
[Bleep] ridiculous.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.311
Up [bleep] creek
without a paddle.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.398
{\an8}It's American traditional,

21:14.481 --> 21:16.525
{\an8}real simple--
it's got to be bold.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.152
My pasty skin finally
comes in handy for something.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.904
My goal is to--
in five hours--

21:20.988 --> 21:22.656
get done about five tattoos.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.367
{\an8}Josh took
the easy route.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.369
{\an8}You know, he basically just
looked at the most basic version

21:27.452 --> 21:30.706
of traditional tattoos,
and just redrew them.

21:30.789 --> 21:31.790
It's kind of like
taking a gamble.

21:31.873 --> 21:32.624
I think the judges
are going to tear him up

21:32.708 --> 21:34.501
for just taking
the easy way out.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.336
[Bleep].

21:37.295 --> 21:38.964
[Bleep].
God, [bleep] It.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.758
Alright, guys, four hours to go.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.428
Alright.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.263
I think my arm's
too little for that.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.973
No, it's not.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.641
It's still
within the parameters.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.938
This is fine.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.274
We finally came up
with a design that she liked.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.275
I wasted an hour and a half

21:58.358 --> 22:01.778
of time where
I should have been tattooing

22:01.862 --> 22:03.488
and already done
with the line work.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.157
[Bleep], [bleep].

22:05.240 --> 22:07.993
I told the girl
she better hold on,

22:08.076 --> 22:09.453
'cause we about
to start tattooing.

22:09.536 --> 22:10.704
[needle buzzes]

22:10.787 --> 22:11.538
I'm worried right now

22:11.621 --> 22:13.665
that I'm not going
to get finished.

22:17.669 --> 22:18.920
Is this your first
American traditional tattoo?

22:19.004 --> 22:21.548
This is the first.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.302
This is definitely
out of my element.

22:25.385 --> 22:29.264
But with, like, a good,
solid tattoo foundation,

22:29.347 --> 22:30.974
anyone who could tattoo
the right way

22:31.058 --> 22:32.934
should be able
to do traditional.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.812
{\an8}I was able to use traditional
style subject matter.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.522
{\an8}That's really all I can do,
and I'm sticking to it.

22:39.608 --> 22:40.901
That's two hours to go,
people.

22:40.984 --> 22:41.401
Two more.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.656
{\an5}-How was that?

22:44.696 --> 22:46.656
-Y'all done?

22:46.740 --> 22:49.367
That's it--wrap her up,
we're out of here.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.912
{\an8}I usually tweak my stuff
out a little bit, and make it

22:51.995 --> 22:53.455
a little more
new-school-esque.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.582
But I think they want it
where it's a fat outline,

22:55.665 --> 22:58.460
you know, heavy shading
and heavy color.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.128
So that's where I'm going to
have to kind of go towards.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.505
A traditional way.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.884
{\an8}There's a basic color palette

23:05.967 --> 23:07.427
{\an8}for American
traditional tattoos.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.347
Red, green,
gold and yellow, black.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.058
I mean, I really don't want
to use just those basic colors.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.977
{\an8}Shane used a color palette

23:16.061 --> 23:18.021
{\an8}that wouldn't even
have been around

23:18.105 --> 23:20.273
in old American
traditional days.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.192
I'm really looking forward
to maybe seeing him

23:22.275 --> 23:24.319
get a bad
critique for once.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.946
Shane, you get to do
a lot of this stuff?

23:26.029 --> 23:30.075
No. It's challenging
to keep it simple.

23:30.158 --> 23:31.827
That's the challenge,
you know.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.663
{\an8}I am miserable at what
I'm seeing out here today.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.290
It's about putting
in a clean line once,

23:37.374 --> 23:39.459
not going over it
and sculpting it

23:39.543 --> 23:41.002
and doing
all these little tricks

23:41.086 --> 23:42.337
to make it look right.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.298
I feel like, in a competition
thing like this,

23:45.382 --> 23:47.217
everybody's trying
to make it tricky--

23:47.300 --> 23:48.802
all the bells
and whistles.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.846
Traditional tattooing--
you should be able to see that

23:50.929 --> 23:51.638
from across the street.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.807
Shane's in there
with a big mag,

23:53.890 --> 23:56.017
feathering out soft
shading to weird brown.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.602
Like, what the [bleep]?

23:57.686 --> 24:02.482
Oliver's whole world is, like,
great, traditional tattooing.

24:02.566 --> 24:06.361
So for him to see this coming
out of these kids

24:06.444 --> 24:07.696
really bums him out.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.781
This is a real
[bleep] debacle here today.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.658
One hour left, everybody.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.748
My design was not
the best design.

24:18.832 --> 24:24.171
{\an8}This drawing is not a drawing
that represents what I can do.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.464
{\an8}I think that Lea's was
a very poorly executed tattoo.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.966
There was some spots
where the line work

24:28.049 --> 24:29.885
was doubled or tripled up
to hide mistakes.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.720
We're dealing
with professional artists

24:31.803 --> 24:33.388
at a higher skill set,

24:33.471 --> 24:34.848
and I just don't think
that's acceptable

24:34.931 --> 24:35.390
at this point in the game.

24:35.473 --> 24:36.892
How you doing, Lea?

24:37.309 --> 24:40.812
Eh... okay.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.315
I wish I could've done
something smaller.

24:43.398 --> 24:45.775
{\an5}-But he didn't--

24:43.398 --> 24:45.775
-You tell him.

24:45.859 --> 24:46.735
I know, but--

24:46.818 --> 24:48.987
You can only give him
what you can do.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.156
It's not up to him to tell you
how much you can work.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.950
This is a situation
that is really gonna hurt me.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.369
I feel like I'm the one

24:56.453 --> 24:58.914
that's gonna have
to go home today.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.334
What's going on here, guys?

25:03.168 --> 25:04.586
How're you feeling in here,
Bili?

25:04.669 --> 25:06.254
Good, good.
I'm having fun.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.716
Is there any significance
to what time the clock's on?

25:09.799 --> 25:11.593
No, actually there's not.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.970
Any time I do a clock,
I put it on the same time.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.264
It's the time I was born.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.600
{\an5}-Uh-oh.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.600
-Oh, there you go.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.852
{\an5}-I didn't know that.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.852
-I really don't know

25:20.936 --> 25:22.103
how the judges are going
to look at this tattoo.

25:22.187 --> 25:25.273
It may not be what they wanted,
but I'm satisfied with it.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.858
See you guys later.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.986
You know, Bili says
that he did some research,

25:30.070 --> 25:33.365
but I just don't think
he really grasped the idea.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.700
Yeah, I ain't feeling it.
You're going to mimic a style,

25:35.784 --> 25:37.661
you know, like traditional,
then, like, do it.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.796
Hey, guys.
30 minutes, okay?

25:47.879 --> 25:49.464
Time's going by fast.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.800
{\an8}It is going by faster
than I thought.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.426
It's going to be
right at the wire.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.680
{\an5}-It hurts bad.

25:53.510 --> 25:56.680
-Doing [bleep] awesome.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.640
My girl's starting
to squirm a little bit.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.476
And I am worried right now that
I'm not going to get finished.

26:02.936 --> 26:03.979
Two and a half minutes left.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.064
I'm almost done
with the outline.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.071
Twenty seconds.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.366
Alright, that's it.
Time's up.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.076
Machine's down.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.245
That's [bleep] nice.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.956
Oh, my God.
I am really worried tonight.

26:23.039 --> 26:23.665
It's possible I could go home.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.710
I love it.
It's amazing.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.670
I'm pretty confident
with this piece.

26:28.753 --> 26:31.172
They'll see the use of color--
that I can pack it in the skin,

26:31.256 --> 26:32.173
and at the same time,

26:32.257 --> 26:34.217
I still kind of keep
the traditional feel.

26:34.301 --> 26:38.096
Not one other person in here
did what was told of them to do.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.306
They didn't simplify enough.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.890
It's American traditional.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.351
{\an8}There's no
traditional tattoo

26:43.435 --> 26:45.562
{\an8}that has opaque gray
in the wings.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.272
{\an5}-That's straight brown.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.272
-That's straight wrong.

26:47.355 --> 26:50.358
This is probably the most
disappointing tattoo of the day.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.944
It's a tattoo that has balls,
and you cut the balls off.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.620
That's a hard-core
piece to do, dude.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.747
I was going into it like
"Ah, [bleep] it, man.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.958
It's traditional.
How easy is this [bleep]."

27:07.042 --> 27:08.376
Yeah, but when
you're under the gun

27:08.460 --> 27:09.794
and you know they're going
to be looking at the quality

27:09.878 --> 27:13.006
of your line work,
it's hard to think traditional.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.175
It's almost impossible.
Five colors?

27:15.258 --> 27:18.178
I rushed it, and I didn't like
some of the lines

27:18.261 --> 27:20.013
and, like, the way
I did my shading.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.474
I know I'm going home.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.027
[suspenseful music]

27:39.157 --> 27:41.368
Welcome to
tonight's elimination.

27:41.451 --> 27:44.162
Your job was to do
an American traditional tattoo.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.956
We will be judging you on color
and how well you stuck

27:47.040 --> 27:49.209
to the American
traditional style.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.794
The reason I thought that this
challenge was good for color

27:50.877 --> 27:54.923
is 'cause it's a challenge
to see how well you work

27:55.006 --> 27:55.965
with a minimal palette.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.593
This challenge,
in particular, is close to me

27:58.676 --> 28:01.179
'cause this is some
of the tattoos I love the most.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.597
But, uh, this is a hard one.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.848
It's obvious that most of you

28:03.932 --> 28:07.102
have not done a whole lot
of traditional tattooing.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.025
Shane, you're up first.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.447
You had the first choice
after the Flash Challenge,

28:19.531 --> 28:21.491
and you picked this client.

28:21.574 --> 28:23.952
I basically
liked his idea the most.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.329
It's, like,
very traditional elements.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.998
Snake, dagger, and a skull.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.834
One thing that makes
traditional colors seem bright

28:30.917 --> 28:34.379
is the heavy contrast
between the lots of black

28:34.462 --> 28:37.298
and the color that's there.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
I wish
that the line work was bold,

28:39.467 --> 28:40.969
and I wish
that the black was heavy,

28:41.052 --> 28:44.848
to give this thing strength
as a solid design.

28:44.931 --> 28:48.101
We're not looking
for soft, smooth blending here.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.811
We're looking for traditional.

28:49.894 --> 28:50.979
Shane, I'm with Oliver.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.106
You going at it
with the light blues

28:53.189 --> 28:54.899
or, like,
the light opaque-ish gray

28:54.983 --> 28:56.776
in the shading
in the skull and stuff,

28:56.860 --> 28:59.529
that part's
driving my eye crazy.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.823
This obviously
is not your best challenge

29:01.906 --> 29:02.907
of this competition.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.205
Bili...

29:12.709 --> 29:16.504
This was your actual first
American traditional?

29:16.588 --> 29:17.922
I fought it all night--

29:18.006 --> 29:19.757
going in with
the very limited palette

29:19.841 --> 29:21.551
is not something
I've really ever done.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.012
The outline is kind of weak.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.514
Traditional tattooing generally
had a really strong outline--

29:26.598 --> 29:27.640
it's pretty important.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.976
This is a fine-line tattoo,
it looks like to me.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.395
There is nothing bold
about this.

29:32.479 --> 29:37.275
The only thing bold about it
is the blanket solid sea of red

29:37.358 --> 29:40.278
that you might as well
just color his whole leg red.

29:41.946 --> 29:46.201
The lettering looks very stiff
inside that banner.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.703
The "But We" almost looks
like one word to me.

29:48.786 --> 29:50.997
{\an5}-I disagree.

29:48.786 --> 29:50.997
-Lettering in tattooing

29:51.080 --> 29:53.208
is so [bleep] important.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.542
I mean, that's the message
of this tattoo.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.670
There's no traditional tattoo
that has opaque gray in a wing.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.546
{\an5}-There's no opaque gray.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.546
-Then what is that stuff?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.423
I used brown, black,
blue, red.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.968
What's in between the black,

30:04.052 --> 30:04.761
in the middle--
in the long part of the wings?

30:04.844 --> 30:06.888
{\an5}-That's brown.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.888
-That's brown?

30:06.971 --> 30:08.014
That's brown.
That's straight brown.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.807
Whatever it is,
it's straight wrong.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.853
You were born at 5:55?

30:13.937 --> 30:17.023
Personally, I think
that's pretty egotistical

30:17.106 --> 30:20.151
to put the time of your birth
into someone else's tattoo.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.028
And saying that in front
of the client--

30:22.111 --> 30:23.571
if I overheard someone
in my shop

30:23.655 --> 30:24.572
telling their client that,
"Oh, by the way,

30:24.656 --> 30:26.824
"like, the time
that I put on here

30:26.908 --> 30:28.117
"is the time
that I was born.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.244
I didn't even run it
by you first"-- I'd say,

30:29.327 --> 30:30.828
"Pack your [bleep]
after you finish that tattoo."

30:39.087 --> 30:40.255
James.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.716
Did not expect that.

30:46.177 --> 30:49.097
What was the late start
in getting the design together

30:49.180 --> 30:50.431
all about?
What happened there?

30:50.515 --> 30:53.935
I had to draw everything over
to fit what she wanted to do,

30:54.018 --> 30:56.688
and she wanted
a "portrait-istic" lighthouse

30:56.771 --> 30:58.273
with some fluffy clouds.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.816
It is obviously, like,
really detailed

30:59.899 --> 31:01.359
for a traditional tattoo.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.778
It's very much the opposite
of, you know, bold lines

31:03.861 --> 31:06.656
and, like, solid shading
and everything.

31:06.739 --> 31:08.616
You got a little bit busy
with the leaves

31:08.700 --> 31:10.034
and the detail in there.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.703
And there was a lot
of areas in these roses

31:11.786 --> 31:13.246
where I think you could have
put more color in.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.415
Could have had a heavier black,
more solid red.

31:15.498 --> 31:16.791
I was hoping to see

31:16.874 --> 31:18.918
your textbook example
of traditional from you.

31:19.002 --> 31:19.919
And that's not what we got.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.925
Lea...

31:28.511 --> 31:29.762
How was this for you?

31:29.846 --> 31:32.181
He was dead set on the design.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.933
And I did not want to do
a big design like that.

31:34.017 --> 31:37.020
I did it as small as I could
on his chest.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.147
It just feels really clumsy
and fumbling.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.025
The water kind of going
in all different directions.

31:42.108 --> 31:43.943
Just feels like you were
grabbing at straws.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.778
He did not want to change
his mind on the tattoo.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.323
A big part of being
a good tattooer

31:48.406 --> 31:49.616
is taking a client's idea
and figuring out a way

31:49.699 --> 31:51.618
to make the most out of it.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.785
But when he saw the design,

31:52.869 --> 31:54.162
he was so excited about it.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.497
I told him, "I'm probably
going to not finish it."

31:56.581 --> 31:58.625
But he was, "I don't care.
I love it, I really want it."

31:58.708 --> 32:00.335
But it's also your
responsibility

32:00.418 --> 32:02.962
to do what you know is going
to produce a good tattoo.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.549
This overall design--

32:06.633 --> 32:07.925
there's a lot
of problems with it,

32:08.009 --> 32:10.678
like the fact that the ship
is low on one side

32:10.762 --> 32:12.347
and there's water
all the way high

32:12.430 --> 32:13.306
on the other side.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.684
For my defense,
he did have a water sleeve

32:16.768 --> 32:19.187
and a fire sleeve,
and that's why he wanted this.

32:19.270 --> 32:23.024
The whole composition of this
tattoo is just painful for me.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.447
Tommy.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.496
It definitely
kind of addresses

32:36.579 --> 32:39.374
the traditional tattoo.
It's not mind-blowing,

32:39.457 --> 32:41.959
{\an5}-but it served its purpose.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.959
-Tommy, I was really hoping

32:42.043 --> 32:42.877
you were going to knock this one
out of the park.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.088
What I can say is
at least you hit it.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.256
When I first saw you working
on the outline,

32:47.340 --> 32:48.383
I was a little worried.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.385
And I was thankful
to see that you went

32:50.468 --> 32:52.095
with the heavy shading
in the hands.

32:52.178 --> 32:54.138
You really stuck it simple.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.556
And it's bright.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.684
The only thing that I have
an issue with on this

32:57.767 --> 33:01.396
is the fingers.
It's like this.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.065
{\an5}-Instead of--

33:01.479 --> 33:04.065
-I was concerned about getting

33:04.148 --> 33:04.565
a little too realistic.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.275
Just to line up.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.069
Just to actually hold it.

33:10.113 --> 33:10.988
Fingers are killing me.

33:15.535 --> 33:15.993
Josh...

33:19.664 --> 33:20.957
{\an5}-How was this for you?

33:19.664 --> 33:20.957
-The whole first year

33:21.040 --> 33:24.210
of my apprenticeship,
all I could do

33:24.293 --> 33:25.795
is go through books,
trace them out,

33:25.878 --> 33:27.922
tattoo them exactly
how they are.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.092
Thank God...

33:31.175 --> 33:33.428
Somebody's doing
a traditional tattoo here.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.096
You packed a lot of black in,

33:35.179 --> 33:36.180
you put the color
where it should be,

33:36.264 --> 33:39.517
{\an5}-and it looks bright.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.517
-Instead of doing one

33:39.600 --> 33:41.477
in an hour and then sitting down
and smoking cigarettes

33:41.561 --> 33:44.313
the rest of the time,
you gave the guy six tattoos.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.608
You took good,
solid, clean images

33:47.692 --> 33:50.862
that have stood the test
of time for a hundred years.

33:50.945 --> 33:51.779
You didn't nitpick

33:51.863 --> 33:53.448
with a bunch of
little frilly details.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.199
You didn't take it
to the limit

33:55.283 --> 33:57.368
with a bunch
of fancy lighter colors.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.454
You did exactly
what was expected.

33:59.537 --> 34:03.541
And this competition
is to hand out the prize

34:03.624 --> 34:04.751
to somebody who can do it all.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.503
That's what it boils down to.

34:07.587 --> 34:08.588
In your case, man,
you know, you hit it.

34:08.670 --> 34:11.299
You hit today's mark.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.467
You could find somebody

34:12.550 --> 34:16.637
who does the most beautiful,
photo-realistic portrait,

34:16.721 --> 34:19.098
and then ask them
to tattoo an eagle.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.976
And it's like--"ugh!"
You need a roll of toilet paper,

34:22.059 --> 34:22.976
'cause that eagle's
not going to come out

34:23.060 --> 34:25.438
looking like
what you're asking for.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.732
It's crazy to really,
like, be the only guy

34:27.815 --> 34:30.818
that really went after it.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.154
It's weird that I'm talking
to one person

34:33.237 --> 34:34.864
instead of talking
to the whole field.

34:35.822 --> 34:37.158
You put your
traditional boots on today.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.913
{\an5}-Good job.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.913
-Thank you.

34:45.750 --> 34:46.918
Okay, artists.

34:47.001 --> 34:47.710
For one of you,
it will be your last visit.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.170
'Cause when you return,

34:50.254 --> 34:52.340
someone will be
packing up their machines

34:52.422 --> 34:53.591
and going home.

34:53.674 --> 34:56.886
[suspenseful music]

35:03.226 --> 35:04.519
There's a reason why
I don't do traditional--

35:04.602 --> 35:05.895
I don't like it.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.105
I don't think
it's a good-looking tattoo.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.024
I think it's antiquated
for a reason.

35:10.107 --> 35:12.109
And technology
has brought tattooing

35:12.193 --> 35:13.694
to a place
where it should be now.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.363
That was a slaying,
though, man.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.615
I think that's pretty
egotistical

35:17.698 --> 35:19.909
to put the time of your birth
into someone else's tattoo.

35:19.992 --> 35:21.494
I just used the time
I was born.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.746
You know, like,
it's a cool number-- 5-5-5.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.790
That was a little weird,

35:25.873 --> 35:26.958
putting your
[bleep] on people like that.

35:27.041 --> 35:27.708
But [bleep] it.
I am egotistical.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.627
I don't give a [bleep].

35:39.136 --> 35:42.348
[upbeat music]

35:48.312 --> 35:51.816
They're looking for dead crap
American traditional [bleep]

35:51.899 --> 35:54.861
that people couldn't draw
50 [bleep] years ago.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.655
Josh took a gamble
on what the judges wanted,

35:57.738 --> 35:58.906
and looks like a star now.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.076
And everybody else did great
tattoos and look like idiots.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.374
Tough one tonight, man.

36:08.457 --> 36:09.959
Kind of heart-wrenching.

36:10.042 --> 36:11.586
Based on the tattoos
that were done today,

36:11.669 --> 36:13.880
I would send Lea home.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.757
Lea may have done
a bad traditional tattoo,

36:16.841 --> 36:20.928
but Bili didn't do
a traditional tattoo at all.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.471
What is it that's lacking
in Bili's?

36:22.555 --> 36:26.017
The outline is just--
it's incredibly weak.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.435
If you're going to do
an outline that thin,

36:27.518 --> 36:28.394
you got to have
enough shading in there

36:28.477 --> 36:31.689
to make it tie in,
and it just doesn't.

36:31.772 --> 36:34.275
There's no reason why we should
let him off the hook.

36:34.358 --> 36:38.195
If I was uninformed
about any of this kind of style,

36:38.279 --> 36:39.530
about this American traditional,

36:39.614 --> 36:41.449
I would look
at those two and say,

36:41.532 --> 36:44.869
"That's crazy.
Bili's is by far better."

36:44.952 --> 36:47.455
What are the aspects
of American traditional

36:47.538 --> 36:50.291
that are incorporated
in Lea's tattoo?

36:50.374 --> 36:52.460
She did have, like,
a strong outline.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.962
Even though it might have
wandered in places,

36:55.046 --> 36:56.339
it was still
pretty assertive and bold.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.967
I love Lea personally more
than I love Bili by far--

37:00.051 --> 37:01.552
I've butted heads with him
the whole ride.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.305
But if I'm looking at
what happened tonight,

37:04.388 --> 37:04.972
I can't go with her.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.683
She did a bad tattoo today.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.186
I think it's time for you

37:10.269 --> 37:11.687
to run down
to the brownstone, bro.

37:11.771 --> 37:12.688
Alright.

37:17.068 --> 37:17.985
Alright, guys.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.570
Once again...

37:20.404 --> 37:21.822
Bili, Lea,

37:21.906 --> 37:24.617
James, and Josh--

37:25.952 --> 37:27.662
in the shop.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.747
See you all in a bit.

37:29.830 --> 37:32.458
Oh, man,
this is so nerve-racking.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.293
$100,000 is
a lot of money.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.878
That's a new shop
for me to open.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.838
I can't be going home,
and I definitely feel

37:37.922 --> 37:39.465
that my tattoo
was not the worst.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.592
I deserve to be here.
I live for this [bleep].

37:41.676 --> 37:44.095
Let's take our damn lumps.

37:45.805 --> 37:49.558
[suspenseful music]

37:52.436 --> 37:54.814
This has been
the toughest deliberation

37:54.897 --> 37:55.439
that we've been faced with yet.

37:57.441 --> 38:00.069
This group of four--
there's a top two

38:00.152 --> 38:01.153
and there's a bottom two.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.825
James...

38:06.492 --> 38:07.326
Josh...

38:08.494 --> 38:10.871
The good news is
you guys are in the top two.

38:15.751 --> 38:19.880
And, Josh, you had the tattoo
of the day, man.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.591
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.387
You were smart.
You went simple,

38:26.470 --> 38:28.306
you went bold,
and it's clean.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.225
And the client told you
what they wanted,

38:31.308 --> 38:33.227
you gave him six
of what he wanted,

38:33.310 --> 38:36.355
and you did some nice
traditional work.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.065
You can thank your mentor
for this one.

38:38.149 --> 38:38.441
Yes.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.531
So if there's a top two,
that can only mean one thing.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.116
You guys are here
in the bottom two.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.786
The judges have gone
back and forth

38:50.870 --> 38:51.537
on a number of different issues.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.623
Lea--

38:54.707 --> 38:57.501
you've been on a high
for the last two competitions.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.211
I usually can do
a traditional tattoo.

38:59.295 --> 39:03.591
I let my client
tell me what to do too much.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.802
It sucks to see this one
come out of your room today.

39:09.346 --> 39:10.181
I looked at Lea's tattoo
from a distance.

39:10.264 --> 39:14.393
And I could tell
from 20-plus feet away

39:14.477 --> 39:16.520
that it was an octopus
and a ship.

39:16.604 --> 39:20.107
Close-up, the details
and certain aspects of design

39:20.191 --> 39:21.317
are weak.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.487
I feel like Lea did a poor
American traditional tattoo.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.533
Bili, you didn't do
a traditional tattoo.

39:29.617 --> 39:33.454
This is probably the most
disappointing tattoo of the day.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.456
You said this is your first
traditional tattoo.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.501
Man, I feel like you still
haven't really done one.

39:38.584 --> 39:40.544
I really tried
to come halfway with this.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.463
I still got a bunch
of black in,

39:42.546 --> 39:43.964
but, you know,
I got to stick to that.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.800
There's no soul
to this tattoo.

39:45.883 --> 39:46.801
To start with--
the lines.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.386
They could be improved
if you just went back in

39:49.470 --> 39:50.596
and bolded it out.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.473
Going in with
the very limited palette

39:52.556 --> 39:55.101
is not something
I've really ever done.

39:55.184 --> 39:58.145
And as much as I love to
complain, bitch, and debate,

39:58.229 --> 40:00.147
I could go off about
all the clients I've gotten.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.982
This isn't a debate--
it's just missing,

40:02.066 --> 40:03.317
it's not that look.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.319
It's a traditional tattoo
that has balls.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.363
And you cut the balls
off the tattoo.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.327
You see how tough
this has been for us?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.664
The judges
have made a decision.

40:16.747 --> 40:20.459
[suspenseful music]

40:23.838 --> 40:25.005
Bili...

40:26.132 --> 40:28.801
You do not have what it takes
to be <i> Ink Master.</i>

40:32.221 --> 40:33.431
Please pack your machines
and go.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.310
This just [bleep] blows.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.271
To be taken out
of this contest

40:40.354 --> 40:42.022
on something like
traditional--

40:42.106 --> 40:44.275
I really wanted to show
off what I could do,

40:44.358 --> 40:45.693
and I never really got
a chance to do it.

40:45.776 --> 40:46.986
It's just [bleep].

40:47.069 --> 40:48.863
My tattoo wasn't
the weakest one this week,

40:48.946 --> 40:52.658
and I'm proud of it regardless
of what the judges say.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.827
Never did I think
I was going to lose to Lea.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.290
{\an5}[Announcer] <i> On the next</i>
<i>episode of Ink Master...</i>

40:59.373 --> 41:01.792
We have a very special
guest judge--

41:01.876 --> 41:04.211
{\an5}-Bird-man.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.211
-Holy [bleep].

41:04.295 --> 41:06.213
I'm Chris Andersen
from the Denver Nuggets.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.548
{\an8}Can't stop
getting tatted up.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.842
{\an8}So, Shane, what are you
going to do when you go home?

41:09.925 --> 41:12.052
{\an8}Tommy's making a run
for it. Just going to have

41:12.136 --> 41:14.388
{\an8}to teach him a lesson
this next challenge.

41:14.471 --> 41:15.723
{\an8}I'm [bleep] fed up.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.391
{\an8}This day is just awful.

41:17.474 --> 41:19.518
{\an8}I don't know if you guys
are just beat up or what,

41:19.602 --> 41:20.519
{\an8}but this week's tattoos

41:20.603 --> 41:22.354
{\an8}look like we're back
in the beginning again.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.940
{\an8}I didn't [bleep] it up
too bad.

41:25.024 --> 41:25.649
{\an8}For real,
this is a mistake, man.
