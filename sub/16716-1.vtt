WEBVTT

00:00.224 --> 00:01.329
You can tell everybody about me.

00:01.331 --> 00:02.867
I don't really care anymore.

00:07.694 --> 00:10.160
My brother and I were super competitive.

00:10.162 --> 00:11.396
Thad has a twin?

00:11.398 --> 00:12.696
Oh, yeah, he never mentioned it?

00:12.698 --> 00:15.666
We chased the same beautiful girls.

00:15.668 --> 00:20.103
I want to be with you,
whatever that means.

00:20.105 --> 00:21.573
I'm all-in.

00:21.575 --> 00:24.843
We want you back at Empirical.

00:24.845 --> 00:27.612
- I don't know.
- Just think about it.

00:27.614 --> 00:29.083
Think about this.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.251 --> 00:51.218
Is there room for this in there?

00:51.220 --> 00:52.752
You're gonna need another bag.

00:52.754 --> 00:55.789
Mom, I already have three
duffels and a backpack.

00:56.858 --> 00:59.058
And don't forget this.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.960
- Oh.
- Condoms.

01:00.962 --> 01:02.763
Got you covered.

01:02.765 --> 01:04.432
Medium to magnum.

01:04.434 --> 01:06.700
- Thoughtful.
- Uh, no small?

01:06.702 --> 01:07.701
I have faith in you.

01:07.703 --> 01:09.102
Thank you, Maggie.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.072
You expecting somebody?

01:12.074 --> 01:13.408
Here, let me try.

01:16.979 --> 01:19.114
Good morning.

01:20.215 --> 01:22.183
Good morning. This is a surprise.

01:22.185 --> 01:25.751
Just bringing doughnuts.
Don't freak out.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.254
Hi.

01:27.256 --> 01:30.590
- Caitlin, you remember Josh.
- Yeah.

01:30.592 --> 01:32.058
Namaste.

01:32.060 --> 01:35.195
I heard somebody was leaving
for college today so...

01:35.197 --> 01:36.998
Excellent!

01:37.000 --> 01:38.332
Come on, we got a suitcase issue.

01:38.334 --> 01:40.200
- Oh. All right.
- Yeah.

01:40.202 --> 01:43.103
All in.

01:43.105 --> 01:45.439
- Morning, Maggie.
- Uh, morning.

01:45.441 --> 01:47.174
Yeah, these are really good. Good job.

01:47.176 --> 01:49.142
What's going on?

01:49.144 --> 01:51.043
So I forgot to tell you something.

01:55.217 --> 01:56.850
You know, I think Josh might be, uh,

01:56.852 --> 01:59.385
more than a midlife crisis,
Mom. This could be serious.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.487
Oh, I'll keep you posted.

02:00.489 --> 02:02.088
I can tell he totally adores you.

02:02.090 --> 02:03.390
It's like the age thing

02:03.392 --> 02:04.491
just doesn't even seem so weird anymore.

02:04.493 --> 02:05.793
He seduced you with a doughnut.

02:05.795 --> 02:08.094
Rose! One second.

02:08.096 --> 02:10.463
You know, I like this Josh 2.0.

02:10.465 --> 02:11.798
He knows he made a mistake

02:11.800 --> 02:13.800
and now he's trying to
prove himself to you.

02:13.802 --> 02:16.636
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to go through all this again.

02:16.638 --> 02:18.538
A hot guy who will lie for you?

02:18.540 --> 02:21.307
What more does anybody
want out of a relationship?

02:21.309 --> 02:24.277
When Charles found me at the mall,

02:24.279 --> 02:26.545
he kissed me in the men's department.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.348
How could you not have told me this?

02:28.350 --> 02:29.883
I... did you like it?

02:29.885 --> 02:31.217
It doesn't matter.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.653
He thinks I'm 26 and he's my boss.

02:33.655 --> 02:34.888
Nothing can happen.

02:34.890 --> 02:36.956
I think you should sue
for sexual harassment,

02:36.958 --> 02:38.491
get a huge settlement, buy my loft,

02:38.493 --> 02:41.228
I'll sponge off you, and
all problems will be solved.

02:41.230 --> 02:42.830
You're seriously not helping here.

02:42.832 --> 02:45.566
Uh, Mom and Maggie, this is Rose.

02:45.568 --> 02:47.033
- We met at orientation
- Hi.

02:47.035 --> 02:48.168
Nice to meet you, Rose.

02:48.170 --> 02:49.537
And these are my parents.

02:49.539 --> 02:50.737
Bob and Julia.

02:50.739 --> 02:52.338
It's so nice to meet the Moms.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.773
Oh.

02:53.775 --> 02:56.477
Actually, I'm Caitlin's mom, Liza.

02:56.479 --> 02:58.044
This is my very good friend Maggie.

02:58.046 --> 02:59.179
Yeah, we're roommates.

02:59.181 --> 03:00.813
Where do you ladies live?

03:00.815 --> 03:03.383
We live in Brooklyn. I've
had a loft there forever.

03:03.385 --> 03:04.485
I'm an artist.

03:04.487 --> 03:05.919
- Oh, well, we collect.
- Oh.

03:05.921 --> 03:07.586
How would you describe your work?

03:07.588 --> 03:10.090
Oh. Big, gay, and fun.

03:10.092 --> 03:14.328
Well, we love fun. We'll
have to check it out.

03:14.330 --> 03:17.897
Bob's sister is married to a woman.

03:17.899 --> 03:19.866
She lives in Portland.

03:19.868 --> 03:21.334
That's nice.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.447
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:34.449 --> 03:38.586
I just want to say I'm
very happy you're back.

03:38.588 --> 03:40.687
- So am I.
- And I would love to find

03:40.689 --> 03:43.355
a moment to... talk. I feel like...

03:43.357 --> 03:46.527
Charles, I was looking
for you in your office.

03:46.529 --> 03:48.461
We are prepping Kiko
Kagami for her book tour

03:48.463 --> 03:49.896
this afternoon, and...

03:49.898 --> 03:52.299
Want to make sure we'll
see you in the meeting.

03:52.301 --> 03:54.334
It's on my calendar.

03:54.336 --> 03:56.569
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.

03:56.571 --> 03:57.837
Thank you.

03:57.839 --> 04:00.106
The salesgirl who picked it out

04:00.108 --> 04:03.312
really... gets me.

04:14.122 --> 04:15.588
Chad, you've got to
get into Thad's computer

04:15.590 --> 04:17.290
and shut down his Facebook account.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.091
I have tried every
password I can think of.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.427
Can you call them?

04:20.428 --> 04:22.028
Oh, no, you can't
"call" Facebook, Kelsey.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.697
No, there is no there there.

04:23.699 --> 04:25.598
Well, what are we supposed to do?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.266
I'm working on getting
them a death certificate,

04:27.268 --> 04:29.235
but until then, his
profile remains active.

04:29.237 --> 04:30.903
Oh, he's like a cyber ghost.

04:30.905 --> 04:33.473
Just send me his computer,
okay, I'm gonna figure this out.

04:33.475 --> 04:37.745
Kelsey, please don't yell at me.

04:37.747 --> 04:38.812
I'm sorry.

04:38.814 --> 04:40.881
No. I'm sorry.

04:40.883 --> 04:42.949
We need to be comforting each other.

04:42.951 --> 04:44.216
You're right, Chad.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.185
Do you have plans tonight?

04:46.187 --> 04:47.656
I'll call you.

04:48.958 --> 04:50.624
- Uh...
- Has Chad had any luck

04:50.626 --> 04:52.291
getting into Thad's computer?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.661
No, and I really need him to,

04:54.663 --> 04:57.163
if only to change this profile picture.

04:57.165 --> 04:58.499
Look at this.

04:58.501 --> 05:00.434
Also, people are still
writing on his wall.

05:00.436 --> 05:03.504
"I hope he's getting his
face licked in heaven."

05:03.506 --> 05:05.572
"Thinking of you on hump day."

05:05.574 --> 05:07.072
And 30 new friend requests.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.810
Wow, he's really getting
that post death bounce.

05:09.812 --> 05:11.478
You know, it's always
sexier when you can't get it.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.879
- Lauren.
- Okay, listen, I... hey,

05:12.881 --> 05:14.447
I am gonna get you through this, girl.

05:14.449 --> 05:16.783
Just think of me as your grief coach.

05:16.785 --> 05:18.718
All right, I got to run,
but I'll meet you after work.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.420
There is a really hot bereavement group

05:20.422 --> 05:21.821
at my temple tonight.

05:21.823 --> 05:23.923
That's wonderful. I'm not even Jewish.

05:23.925 --> 05:25.358
Even better, really.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.860
Oh, and equine therapy
in the morning, okay,

05:26.862 --> 05:30.297
don't forget. We've got a busy schedule.

05:30.299 --> 05:31.634
Bye.

05:32.968 --> 05:34.435
I'm not sure what's more stressful,

05:34.437 --> 05:36.035
being a bride or a widow.

05:36.037 --> 05:40.074
I don't want to smother you,
but whenever you need me,

05:40.076 --> 05:42.810
day or night, I'm there.

05:42.812 --> 05:44.778
I know you are.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.213
Okay.

05:46.215 --> 05:49.216
I am so pleased to introduce
you all to Kiko Kagami,

05:49.218 --> 05:52.286
the writer of "Blissful Living,"
or as it is known in Japan,

05:52.288 --> 05:53.653
where it is the number one bestseller

05:53.655 --> 05:57.257
for the last two years,
"Seikatsu Shiawasena."

05:57.259 --> 06:00.225
Uh, "Shiawasena Seikatsu."

06:00.227 --> 06:02.396
Arigato.

06:02.398 --> 06:03.997
Kiko is in the U.S.
for a seven day tour,

06:03.999 --> 06:06.432
which she will be kicking
off on Thursday morning

06:06.434 --> 06:09.769
with an appearance on
Kathie Lee and Hoda.

06:09.771 --> 06:11.737
Kiko, please.

06:11.739 --> 06:15.975
My book is rooted in the idea
that all objects have a spirit,

06:15.977 --> 06:18.110
and we must work on lightening our load

06:18.112 --> 06:21.714
by setting free those objects
which no longer serve us.

06:21.716 --> 06:24.817
We must be ruthless in
identifying these things

06:24.819 --> 06:28.487
and with a tender heart,
kiss them and let them go.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.990
She got Oprah to give up bread.

06:30.992 --> 06:32.461
It was not easy.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.896
And as we do with our things,

06:35.898 --> 06:38.398
so must we do with our priorities.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.768
I ask you all now, as an exercise,

06:40.770 --> 06:42.903
to take the paper and pen before you

06:42.905 --> 06:47.042
and divide the paper into
four quadrants like so.

06:49.011 --> 06:51.543
Now I would like you to
write in each quadrant

06:51.545 --> 06:53.980
those things in your
life you care most about

06:53.982 --> 06:57.451
in order of importance.
Please do this now.

07:03.146 --> 07:04.607
_

07:08.463 --> 07:09.635
_

07:12.276 --> 07:13.613
_

07:15.803 --> 07:17.236
_

07:20.897 --> 07:22.192
_

07:32.920 --> 07:34.521
Now stop. Look carefully

07:34.523 --> 07:37.324
at what you have written
in your fourth quadrant.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.627
Whatever it is will destroy you,

07:40.629 --> 07:43.896
because it takes away
from your real priorities.

07:43.898 --> 07:47.367
This is the vortex, the vortex of death.

07:47.369 --> 07:48.701
I wrote my mother.

07:48.703 --> 07:52.204
Young lady, as an
example... may I see yours?

07:52.206 --> 07:53.372
Oh, no, thank you.

07:53.374 --> 07:55.009
Oh, please, I must insist.

07:55.011 --> 07:56.009
No.

07:56.011 --> 07:57.410
- Yes. 
- No.

07:57.412 --> 07:59.211
- I think so, ye...
- No!

07:59.213 --> 08:01.447
- I think now...
- Uh, no.

08:08.990 --> 08:10.925
Huh.

08:25.507 --> 08:28.007
The idea behind Equine Assisted Therapy

08:28.009 --> 08:31.511
is that by communicating with
a properly certified horse,

08:31.513 --> 08:33.979
you can unpack your toxic emotions

08:33.981 --> 08:36.515
and move more quickly
through the grieving process.

08:36.518 --> 08:37.751
That's wonderful.

08:37.753 --> 08:39.385
That... that is exactly
what my girl needs.

08:39.388 --> 08:42.922
You can tell your horse things
that you might be too ashamed

08:42.924 --> 08:45.992
to share with a friend
or with a therapist.

08:45.994 --> 08:47.026
Okay.

08:47.028 --> 08:50.032
Let me introduce you to Mike.

08:51.566 --> 08:52.902
Go heal.

08:54.769 --> 08:56.636
Gently brush him,

08:56.638 --> 09:00.776
and when you're comfortable,
share your feelings.

09:05.547 --> 09:07.582
This is weird.

09:10.451 --> 09:13.588
You really are a beautiful boy.

09:15.289 --> 09:19.325
You know, I do have one secret
that I'm ashamed to talk about.

09:19.327 --> 09:22.628
I can't admit it to anyone.

09:39.181 --> 09:40.516
Oh.

09:42.450 --> 09:45.185
Congratulations, you got a release.

09:45.187 --> 09:46.453
Yes!

09:59.467 --> 10:02.301
I've got a proposition.

10:02.303 --> 10:03.402
Okay.

10:03.404 --> 10:05.305
I would love to clear the air.

10:05.307 --> 10:10.242
If you're amenable, meet me
at The Carlyle tonight at 9:00.

10:10.244 --> 10:12.378
If you show up, great,

10:12.380 --> 10:16.349
and if you don't,
that's completely fine.

10:16.351 --> 10:18.385
It will be like it never happened.

10:18.387 --> 10:21.523
Charles, come say hello to Kiko.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.929
_

10:50.720 --> 10:52.219
So behind door number one,

10:52.221 --> 10:54.988
we have your sweet,
hot, 26 year-old boyfriend,

10:54.990 --> 10:56.489
who honestly knows and adores you

10:56.491 --> 10:58.758
and wants to be with you,
despite your craziness.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.328
Behind door number two, we've got

11:00.330 --> 11:02.329
your 40-something divorced
boss, with two kids.

11:02.331 --> 11:04.364
Is there really a choice?

11:04.366 --> 11:06.966
He's a grown up. We talk about books.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.502
Talking? Books? Ugh.

11:08.504 --> 11:09.503
I've at least got to go meet him

11:09.505 --> 11:11.171
and make it less awkward.

11:11.173 --> 11:12.873
You know, I've kissed plenty
of people inappropriately,

11:12.875 --> 11:14.675
and it's really not that big of a deal.

11:14.677 --> 11:16.142
I know my priorities.

11:16.144 --> 11:18.411
It's Caitlin, you, and my job.

11:18.413 --> 11:21.315
Anything that gets in the
way of that is a mistake.

11:24.653 --> 11:27.921
You're gonna kiss him again.

11:27.923 --> 11:29.355
I know you.

11:43.538 --> 11:45.205
I know what you're doing.

11:45.207 --> 11:47.007
Excuse me?

11:47.009 --> 11:48.441
Trying to avoid loneliness,

11:48.443 --> 11:50.710
burying your misery in your work.

11:51.913 --> 11:55.147
I think you're projecting, Diana.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.617
Maybe.

11:56.619 --> 12:00.054
But I know a girl who needs
to cut loose when I see one.

12:00.056 --> 12:01.588
Can I buy you a drink?

12:01.590 --> 12:02.888
Sure.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.591
Just give me a minute.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.259
You wanna hit the bar next door?

12:06.261 --> 12:09.798
Oh. I've got a better place in mind.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.934
After my divorce I spent
every night for years

12:13.936 --> 12:16.836
in the office. I got to
know all of the janitors.

12:16.838 --> 12:19.339
Anything to avoid
putting myself out there.

12:19.341 --> 12:20.873
How many years were you married?

12:20.875 --> 12:23.477
Five years. Andy really
was a wonderful man.

12:23.479 --> 12:24.844
I don't mean to say
"was." He's not dead,

12:24.846 --> 12:28.315
he's just just remarried... to Eduardo.

12:28.317 --> 12:29.483
Did you know?

12:29.485 --> 12:30.816
He was a wasp from Connecticut.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.586
I just thought he was
uptight and well-mannered.

12:33.588 --> 12:35.488
So did you guys have sex?

Hi, Julia, you look beautiful. Hi. Aw.

13:36.018 --> 13:38.652
- We're celebrating.
- No we're not, I'm in mourning.

13:38.654 --> 13:40.820
Aw, we just sent Rose off to college.

13:40.822 --> 13:42.723
That's not possible, she's 14.

13:42.725 --> 13:45.493

13:45.495 --> 13:47.194
Hey, are you alone? You should join us.

13:47.196 --> 13:50.062
Oh, thanks, I'm, uh, just
meeting a friend for a drink.

13:50.064 --> 13:51.464
Oh, is it a date?

13:51.466 --> 13:52.799
N... not exactly.

13:52.801 --> 13:54.767
It's this young woman I work with,

13:54.769 --> 13:58.504
and I kind of kissed myself
into a complicated situation.

13:58.506 --> 14:00.007
Ooh, that sounds interesting.

14:00.009 --> 14:02.743
Please, don't tell me
she's your assistant.

14:02.745 --> 14:04.210
She's not my assistant.

14:04.212 --> 14:05.612
- Oh, God.
- Ah, listen,

14:05.614 --> 14:08.315
as your friend, congrats,
you still got it.

14:08.317 --> 14:11.185
As your attorney, I see lawsuits and HR.

14:11.187 --> 14:13.987
I know, but she's different.

14:13.989 --> 14:17.523
There's something about her.
She's like a... like an old soul.

14:17.525 --> 14:18.892
Yeah, in a hot, young body.

14:18.894 --> 14:20.661
Yeah, you're already putting yourself

14:20.663 --> 14:23.129
in a compromising position by
inviting her out for a drink.

14:23.131 --> 14:24.497
- Come on.
- I would keep it

14:24.499 --> 14:25.865
purely about business.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.901
If you want to pursue
a romantic relationship,

14:27.903 --> 14:29.703
find her a job somewhere else.

14:29.705 --> 14:31.271
Is there another option?

14:31.273 --> 14:32.372
You could marry her.

14:32.374 --> 14:33.940
- Oh.
- Okay.

14:46.054 --> 14:48.921
Miss... Miss, can I help you?

14:48.923 --> 14:52.124
Uh, no, thank you, I'm fine.

I have a vodka or two.

16:51.542 --> 16:52.841
Or six.

16:52.843 --> 16:53.974
Okay, well, come on, let's get you home.

16:53.976 --> 16:57.144

- All right.
- Taxi.

17:02.352 --> 17:05.252
- Watch your head.
- Oh, gosh. Sit down.

17:13.829 --> 17:15.997
Welcome to my home.

17:15.999 --> 17:21.569
Wow. Diana, your place is gorgeous.

17:21.571 --> 17:22.637
Yeah.

17:22.638 --> 17:24.271
It's a Candela building.

17:24.273 --> 17:26.342
Work hard enough for the next ten years

17:26.344 --> 17:30.545
and maybe you'll have a
beautiful apartment like this.

17:30.547 --> 17:33.681
Actually, probably never.
Not at today's prices.

17:33.683 --> 17:35.450
Can... I get you all a drink?

17:35.452 --> 17:37.585
- Diana, are you sure...
- Bup, bup!

17:37.587 --> 17:41.623
Liza, I think I know
when I've had enough.

17:41.625 --> 17:42.891
Kels?

17:42.893 --> 17:44.459
Glass of white wine would be great.

17:44.461 --> 17:47.262
How about vodka? Wine is for fat people.

17:47.264 --> 17:48.697
Okay, then.

17:48.699 --> 17:52.570
Excuse the mess, I
wasn't expecting company.

17:55.405 --> 17:56.939
I suppose you'll want the tour.

17:56.941 --> 17:59.807
- Uh... sure.
- Yeah.

17:59.809 --> 18:00.909
This is where I sit.

18:00.911 --> 18:03.047
It's lovely.

18:05.816 --> 18:06.849
I don't want that either.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.187
Ooh.

18:12.189 --> 18:14.325
- This is where I sleep.
- Yeah.

18:17.728 --> 18:20.728
And this is my sanctum.

18:22.399 --> 18:25.065
Oh, my God!

18:25.067 --> 18:29.137
Diana!

18:29.139 --> 18:32.173
I'm... speechless.

18:32.175 --> 18:35.377
Kiko Kagami would have
a field day in here.

18:35.379 --> 18:38.145
Half the things are
probably vintage by now.

18:38.147 --> 18:40.916
Is that... your wedding dress?

18:40.918 --> 18:43.054
Yes.

18:47.024 --> 18:50.525
It's what I married Andy
in almost 15 years ago.

18:50.527 --> 18:52.794
Oh, please, don't put that on.

18:52.796 --> 18:56.198
Don't be ridiculous.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.167
I am gonna kiss this thing.

19:01.872 --> 19:04.105
And let it go.

19:16.354 --> 19:18.920
Oh... my God. How did that happen?

19:18.922 --> 19:21.456
Uh. She found me working late

19:21.458 --> 19:23.124
and she asked me to
have a drink with her.

19:23.126 --> 19:24.727
Said she recognized

19:24.729 --> 19:27.496
a bit of herself in me. That's scary.

19:27.498 --> 19:30.998
Okay, come on, you
are nothing like Diana.

19:32.803 --> 19:36.270
It is true that I haven't been
wanting to go home, though.

19:36.272 --> 19:38.140
It's like I've been
burying my guilt in my work,

19:38.142 --> 19:40.275
or something.

19:40.277 --> 19:43.480
What could you possibly
have to feel guilty about?

19:47.351 --> 19:49.450
That maybe I was marrying Thad

19:49.452 --> 19:52.519
just to prove everybody else wrong.

19:52.521 --> 19:57.057
And when he died, a tiny
part of me felt relieved,

19:57.059 --> 20:00.628
because now I didn't have to marry him.

20:00.630 --> 20:02.633
Isn't that awful?

20:03.933 --> 20:05.970
No, it's human.

20:10.207 --> 20:12.006
Kelsey, have you told
this to anybody else?

20:13.876 --> 20:15.943
Just Mike.

20:15.945 --> 20:18.112
Who's Mike?

20:18.114 --> 20:19.747
A horse.

20:25.087 --> 20:26.787
Never mind. I can't even.

20:49.241 --> 20:50.539
In my office!

20:55.847 --> 20:57.316
How are you feeling?

21:01.351 --> 21:03.051
I woke up in my Spanx,

21:03.053 --> 21:06.690
and my closet looked like it
had been pillaged by thieves.

21:06.692 --> 21:09.258
Is there anything else I should know?

21:09.260 --> 21:11.528
That about covers it.

21:11.530 --> 21:14.697
Get me four Aspirin and a Diet Sunkist,

21:14.699 --> 21:18.334
and we will never speak
of last night again.

21:18.336 --> 21:22.174
Hey. Kiko Kagami is
on Kathie Lee and Hoda.

21:23.942 --> 21:26.075
It's about simplifying your life

21:26.077 --> 21:28.143
and being honest with yourself.

21:28.145 --> 21:30.011
Do I really need this thing?

21:30.013 --> 21:32.448
We really need so little to be happy.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.450
And sometimes, the less we have,

21:34.452 --> 21:35.718
the more happy you are.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.118
I kind of agree with her.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.021
How many bracelets do you have?

21:39.023 --> 21:40.256
I have lots.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.723
And do you love these the most?

21:41.725 --> 21:44.362
I'm so sorry about last night.

21:46.297 --> 21:47.630
Liza, I think you're fantastic.

21:47.632 --> 21:49.231
You don't have to explain a thing.

21:49.233 --> 21:51.666
Then kiss them and let them go.

21:51.668 --> 21:53.469
Well, when I get home, I'm gonna kiss

21:53.471 --> 21:55.136
this whole outfit
buh-bye. Oh, I'm so glad.

21:55.138 --> 21:57.807
- I just want to you know...
- It was just a kiss, Liza.

21:57.809 --> 21:59.108
Let it go.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.942
- Kiss this and let it go.
- Hmm? This?
