WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.235
RUSSELL: I was just trying
to help the guy out.

00:03.269 --> 00:05.939
DONNELL: I understand.
I wasn't selling, all right?

00:05.971 --> 00:07.774
He was looking to score.

00:07.808 --> 00:08.875
I took his 20,

00:08.909 --> 00:10.176
I went down the block,

00:10.210 --> 00:11.678
I asked a guy I know
to sell me a dime.

00:11.712 --> 00:12.913
That left 10 bucks for me.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.214
That's easy money.

00:14.247 --> 00:16.482
That's why we're using
an agency defense.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.051
It means you were acting
as an agent

00:18.084 --> 00:18.919
for the buyer.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.587
Look, Russell,
I think we have

00:20.621 --> 00:22.222
a solid shot at this.

00:23.957 --> 00:24.891
Okay.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.594
9:00?

00:27.628 --> 00:28.261
9:00,

00:28.294 --> 00:29.830
court room five.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.437
Russell,

00:39.072 --> 00:40.507
is everything okay?

00:42.242 --> 00:43.877
Yeah. I don't know.
I guess I'm, uh,

00:45.979 --> 00:47.047
just nervous.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.582
DONNELL:
I've seen you nervous.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.751
Something's going on.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.420
You know you can talk to me.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.225
(sighs)

00:59.259 --> 01:00.561
A few weeks ago

01:02.896 --> 01:04.129
I was short on cash,

01:05.766 --> 01:06.466
and there's this guy.

01:06.499 --> 01:07.568
He's a dealer.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.135
Only he's independent.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.203
He doesn't run with the set.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.905
He just--
he does things on his own.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.576
I tried to rob him.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.944
What else?

01:17.978 --> 01:20.947
I know it was stupid,
all right?

01:20.981 --> 01:22.048
The thing is,

01:22.082 --> 01:23.517
he didn't give
the money up.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.152
He grabbed for the gun

01:28.655 --> 01:29.990
and I shot him.

01:30.023 --> 01:30.891
He's dead?

01:30.924 --> 01:31.892
(sighs)

01:31.925 --> 01:34.260
Maybe you shouldn't be
telling me this.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.096
No. Bobby, I got
a serious problem here,

01:36.129 --> 01:36.897
all right? It turns out

01:36.930 --> 01:38.231
this independent drug dealer

01:38.264 --> 01:40.100
is not so independent, okay?

01:41.267 --> 01:44.070
He ran with this guy
named Derek Grant.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.006
Now, word is on the street,

01:46.039 --> 01:47.107
when Grant finds out
who it is

01:47.140 --> 01:49.142
that killed his boy,
whoever did it,

01:49.175 --> 01:50.310
is dead.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.546
(sighs) What are the chances

01:52.579 --> 01:53.614
they know it was you?

01:54.180 --> 01:55.015
I don't know.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.452
He wants to meet me tonight,

01:59.485 --> 02:00.854
corner of 128th and Linden.

02:00.887 --> 02:03.123
You can't go.
I have to go.

02:03.156 --> 02:04.525
I don't go,
he knows it was me.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.526
DONNELL:
He must already know

02:05.559 --> 02:06.860
if he's calling a meeting.

02:06.893 --> 02:07.861
You can't go.

02:07.894 --> 02:08.895
Bobby, he already knows
it's me.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.463
I'm dead anyway, okay?

02:11.832 --> 02:13.066
Look, I'm just
telling you this,

02:16.169 --> 02:17.337
if he takes me out,

02:19.472 --> 02:20.807
I don't want you
to let him walk.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.846
If I'm dead,

02:25.879 --> 02:27.347
you let someone know
what happened.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.082
We need to talk about this.

02:29.115 --> 02:29.916
Uh, I don't know.

02:29.950 --> 02:30.951
Maybe the police.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.485
I can't go
to the police, Bobby.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.587
I killed somebody.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.156
Look, I'll be there,

02:36.189 --> 02:37.423
9:00,

02:37.457 --> 02:38.158
court room five.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.059
Russell,

02:39.092 --> 02:40.426
I don't think you should go.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.628
RUSSELL: 9:00.
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.003
(music playing)

03:35.481 --> 03:38.418
(indistinct chatter)

03:40.987 --> 03:42.923
DONNELL: (sighs)
I'm getting a bad feeling.

03:42.956 --> 03:43.857
YOUNG:
He's been late before.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.325
What, I shouldn't worry?

03:45.358 --> 03:46.292
He went to meet with a man

03:46.326 --> 03:47.594
who might wanna kill him.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.331
I should have
never let him go.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.267
Let's give him
a few more minutes.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.704
(elevator dings)
(sighs)

04:01.307 --> 04:02.843
DANIEL: I didn't rape anybody.

04:02.876 --> 04:03.710
DOLE: Daniel...

04:03.744 --> 04:05.411
I'm innocent, Ms. Dole.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.446
DOLE: Even so,

04:06.479 --> 04:08.582
you were convicted
seven years ago.

04:08.615 --> 04:09.550
I don't...
DANIEL: But they're doing

04:09.583 --> 04:10.817
these DNA tests now.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.118
If I can get one...

04:12.152 --> 04:13.353
Hold on.

04:13.386 --> 04:14.788
It isn't that easy.

04:14.821 --> 04:15.722
(sighs)

04:15.756 --> 04:18.692
A guy in C-block
got 63 years.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.260
They released him
last month

04:20.293 --> 04:21.361
after running some tests.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.329
It happens.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.464
Don't tell me
it doesn't happen.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.832
DOLE: I'm not saying
it doesn't happen.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.602
What I am saying,

04:28.635 --> 04:29.603
the courts

04:29.636 --> 04:31.371
get thousands of requests,

04:31.404 --> 04:33.139
most of them
from guilty defendants

04:33.173 --> 04:34.608
who wanna roll the dice.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.277
DANIEL: Innocent people
do get released.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.479
DOLE: Six so far
in Massachusetts.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.881
Nationwide, it's like 90.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.517
I know this isn't
what you wanna hear,

04:43.550 --> 04:44.417
but convincing a court

04:44.450 --> 04:45.485
to order more tests,

04:45.519 --> 04:47.721
it's an extreme long shot.

04:47.754 --> 04:49.122
And we would need
the DA's office

04:49.155 --> 04:50.524
to support our request.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.958
If this is about money...

04:51.992 --> 04:53.293
It isn't.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.095
Is it because you think
I'm guilty?

04:56.196 --> 04:57.664
(sighs)

04:57.698 --> 04:59.933
I guess I'm just
not optimistic.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.803
The way you cared back then,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.072
it stuck with me.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.975
I got 40 years

05:09.009 --> 05:10.944
for something I didn't do.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.180
I need you.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.785
There's another problem.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.521
You'll becoming up
for parole.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.523
There's a chance the board
could release you early.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.658
DANIEL: I won't be considered
for another 10 years.

05:24.691 --> 05:25.659
DOLE: But if you push this

05:25.692 --> 05:27.127
and the results come back

05:27.160 --> 05:28.028
confirming you're guilt...

05:28.061 --> 05:29.229
That won't happen.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.597
DOLE: If it does,

05:30.631 --> 05:34.400
you could end up
serving the full 40.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.902
There's a risk, Daniel.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.538
Listen to me.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.206
That will not happen.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.042
Talk to the DA,

05:42.075 --> 05:43.109
get the test.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.315
WEEKS: You don't know
where your client is?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.051
DONNELL: No, Your Honor.
I'm sorry.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.252
I really don't.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.820
He told you he'd be here?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.722
Yes.
If this is a stunt

05:55.756 --> 05:57.891
to buy time...
It isn't.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.025
When did you last see him?

05:59.059 --> 06:00.326
Last night.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.795
And you haven't heard
from him today?

06:01.828 --> 06:02.929
No.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.802
Bench warrant ordered
for Mr. Hampton.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.971
I'll hold the jury
for 24 hours.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.274
In the meantime, Mr. Donnell,
I suggest you find your client.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.412
Any ideas?
You know where he lives?

06:19.445 --> 06:20.413
I know his address.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.615
Let's go.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.850
You think he's innocent?

06:23.884 --> 06:24.985
I don't know what to think.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.286
Why would he ask
for a DNA test?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.054
Because he's desperate
and bored.

06:28.088 --> 06:28.922
If you run the test,

06:28.955 --> 06:30.123
we'll know for sure.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.492
Wait a second.
I can't just ask for tests

06:32.526 --> 06:35.195
without some legal basis.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.130
Unless it's a favor,

06:38.264 --> 06:39.633
which is what I'm asking for.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.570
I was right out
of law school, Helen.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.871
It wasn't inadequate council,

06:44.905 --> 06:46.306
but it wasn't
my best work either.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.141
You screwed up?

06:48.174 --> 06:50.811
I don't think so, but...

06:50.844 --> 06:52.378
You didn't.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.347
Two rapes, four days apart,

06:54.380 --> 06:55.716
both at the same time and night

06:55.749 --> 06:57.150
in the same part of town.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.151
I know the file.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.753
He was identified
by both victims.

06:59.786 --> 07:00.954
No alibi.
DOLE: Helen,

07:00.987 --> 07:02.956
I know the file very well.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.426
Look, this isn't easy for me.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.029
You don't have to do this,

07:09.062 --> 07:10.797
I know.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.666
But the thing is,

07:12.699 --> 07:15.001
I don't even think
he's innocent,

07:15.035 --> 07:16.770
but if there's a chance he is,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.540
I need to know.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.848
YOUNG: He doesn't take
his meetings at home

07:27.881 --> 07:28.815
by any chance.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.552
I hope not.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.397
Russell.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.369
Oh, my God.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.571
Are you the police?

07:50.604 --> 07:51.705
DONNELL: No, Mrs. Hampton.

07:51.738 --> 07:54.474
I'm Bobby Donnell.
This is Eugene Young.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.909
We're attorneys.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.343
We represent your husband.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.212
Where is he?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.280
Is he okay?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.382
We were hoping
to find him here.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.152
(sobs)

08:10.791 --> 08:12.358
He didn't come home
last night.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.227
Before he left,
he didn't tell me

08:14.260 --> 08:15.562
where he was going.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.297
What time was that,
do you remember?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.231
MRS. HAMPTON: It was late.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.901
I don't know.
I know it was after 1:00.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.569
Something was wrong,
I could tell.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.871
I'm sure your husband's fine,
Mrs. Hampton.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.574
Do you know something?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.576
No. I'm sorry. We don't.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.578
You came here looking for him,

08:31.612 --> 08:32.779
there's got to be a reason.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.780
YOUNG: We were supposed
to start

08:33.813 --> 08:35.616
your husband's trial
this morning.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.150
We're here

08:37.650 --> 08:39.753
because he didn't show up.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.455
DONNELL: I'm sorry.
We can't be more help.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.789
If you hear from Russell,

08:43.823 --> 08:44.625
please let us know.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.027
Yeah.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.769
(sighs)

08:55.802 --> 08:57.704
That bad feeling
you had before,

08:59.272 --> 09:00.140
now I got it.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.846
(door opens)

09:07.981 --> 09:08.949
Problem?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.652
Could be.
Seven-year-old double rape case.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.554
I ordered a DNA test.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.122
Why?

09:16.156 --> 09:17.257
Favor bank.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.158
Look, I'm sorry.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.093
I didn't check with you first.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.664
Anyway, the sample
from the first rape

09:23.697 --> 09:26.132
was too degraded
to withstand any testing.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.601
What about the second?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.537
It wasn't a match.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.874
(music playing)

09:33.907 --> 09:35.275
We've had the wrong guy
in prison

09:35.308 --> 09:36.810
for seven years.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.112
Seems so.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.948
So you'll release him?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.617
Well...
DOLE: What well?

09:43.650 --> 09:44.484
How can you not?

09:44.518 --> 09:46.286
He's cleared
on one rape, Lindsay,

09:46.319 --> 09:47.220
but on the other...

09:47.253 --> 09:48.922
The rapes
were connected, Helen.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.591
The prosecution
argued that at trial.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.425
Beyond all reasonable doubt,
I might add.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.094
The victim ID'd your client.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.196
Both victims ID'd my client.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.131
If one turns out
to be clearly wrong

09:58.164 --> 09:59.833
and the rapes are connected...

09:59.866 --> 10:01.201
We can't just kick him.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.268
Why not?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.237
All right.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.371
(sighs) Uh, take a breath.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.507
I'm gonna go talk
to the victim,

10:06.540 --> 10:07.941
then I'll go see Gavin Brown.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.042
Who is Gavin Brown?

10:09.075 --> 10:11.411
(sighs) The DNA we tested,

10:11.444 --> 10:13.914
it didn't just exonerate
your client.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.984
It came back an exact match
to an inmate

10:18.018 --> 10:20.954
doing three years at Concord
for burglary.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.924
(music playing)

10:29.329 --> 10:30.764
DONNELL: I think
I should go to the police.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.965
YOUNG: You can't.
Eugene...

10:31.998 --> 10:33.767
YOUNG: Bobby, do we really
need to go through this again?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.938
The client told you
what happened in confidence.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.472
He killed somebody.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.442
You can't risk making him
a homicide suspect.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.377
DONNELL: Russell said
he'd be in court at the trial.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.846
He also said

10:45.879 --> 10:46.913
if anything happened to him,

10:46.947 --> 10:48.982
tell the police
about the Derek Grant.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.051
He said if he were taken out.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.485
We don't know
if he's been killed.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.486
DONNELL: So what do we do?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.488
Just continue to sit tight?

10:55.522 --> 10:56.823
YOUNG: Yes.
For how long?

10:58.291 --> 11:00.794
What if we do tell the police
about Derek Grant?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.162
The police will go see him,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.129
and he tells them

11:03.163 --> 11:04.565
how his partner was murdered

11:04.598 --> 11:06.399
by Russell Hampton.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.201
We just made our client

11:08.234 --> 11:09.836
the primary suspect

11:09.870 --> 11:11.705
in a murder.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.273
Is that what
you suggesting we do?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.041
Russell's intent was,

11:15.075 --> 11:16.309
if he disappears,

11:16.342 --> 11:17.878
go to the police.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.445
He's disappeared.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.584
I have to make
a call here, Eugene.

11:27.754 --> 11:28.855
Okay. Look,

11:31.558 --> 11:33.426
if we go to the police,

11:33.459 --> 11:36.096
we tell them as little
as possible.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.698
That we are worried
about our client.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.732
We think he's in danger.

11:38.765 --> 11:39.600
That's it.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.902
If necessary,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.404
we suggest they talk
to Derek Grant.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.539
Nothing else.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.773
No matter what they ask.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.545
I should have stopped him.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.680
You need to get that
out of your mind.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.218
Come on.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.320
Let's do this.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.892
DOLE: The results we have

12:05.926 --> 12:07.260
are only preliminary,

12:07.293 --> 12:09.129
but it's pretty certain.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.997
Then why won't they
let me out?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.799
Because, technically,

12:12.833 --> 12:14.535
you're only cleared
on one rape,

12:14.568 --> 12:15.335
the second one.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.737
The first one, Amy Henley,

12:16.770 --> 12:18.304
the DNA doesn't
clear you of that.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.440
Uh, only because
it couldn't be tested.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.642
DOLE: I understand.

12:21.675 --> 12:22.743
And it's likely

12:22.776 --> 12:23.944
the DA will see it that way,

12:23.977 --> 12:25.411
but she wants to talk
to the victim

12:25.445 --> 12:26.747
and this other suspect.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.214
Suspect?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.150
I thought the DNA
was conclusive.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.318
Yes. They've got him
on the second rape.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.520
On the first,

12:33.554 --> 12:34.855
he's just a suspect.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.859
Are you saying

12:38.892 --> 12:40.594
that after proving in court,

12:40.627 --> 12:41.662
that both rapes

12:41.695 --> 12:44.130
were committed by the same man,

12:44.164 --> 12:45.899
now they can argue
that they were committed

12:45.932 --> 12:47.167
by different people?

12:47.968 --> 12:48.802
Yes.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.170
How--

12:50.771 --> 12:52.472
What's going on?

12:52.506 --> 12:53.507
DOLE: Daniel,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.275
the DA's office
doesn't do cartwheels

12:55.308 --> 12:57.578
at the chance to free
convicted rapists.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.345
Even when they turned out
to be innocent?

12:59.379 --> 13:01.582
In their minds, you haven't
turned out to be innocent yet.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.792
Let's just take this
one step at a time.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.095
This is great news.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.998
Your 40-year sentence,
it's gone for good.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.236
You're worried
about your client?

13:23.269 --> 13:24.571
Yes. We think his life

13:24.605 --> 13:25.706
could be in danger.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.610
That's it?

13:29.643 --> 13:30.677
You have to tell me
more than that.

13:30.711 --> 13:33.046
It's privileged, Mike.
We can't say more.

13:33.079 --> 13:33.914
MIKE: Well,
what do you want me to do?

13:33.947 --> 13:34.981
You have to give me
something to go on?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.920
Look, the warrant squad's
already on this.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.888
I can't have detectives
without information.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.293
There's a man named
Derek Grant...

13:47.327 --> 13:48.962
Drug dealer, Jamaica Plain.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.798
He might know
where to find our client.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.969
Does Russell Hampton
have a problem with Derek Grant?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.904
That's not something
we're able to discuss.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.773
You can't just tell me
Derek Grant

13:59.806 --> 14:01.207
and expect...
DONNELL: Mike,

14:01.842 --> 14:02.876
that's all we know.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.380
As a friend, we're asking you
to question the guy.

14:08.749 --> 14:09.816
I can't do that.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.452
You can't just ask him
a couple of questions?

14:12.485 --> 14:13.754
No.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.321
Why not?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.591
Because Derek Grant
was shot to death

14:17.624 --> 14:20.160
two nights ago on the corner
of 128th and Linden.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.968
(alarm buzzes)

14:28.001 --> 14:29.936
I didn't rape
any seven-year-old.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.237
That's not what I said.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.640
You just said I did
some seven-year-old rape.

14:33.674 --> 14:35.709
That's not--

14:35.742 --> 14:37.243
(sighs) All right.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.411
Let's try this again.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.146
Seven years ago,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.115
you raped two women,

14:42.148 --> 14:44.551
one named Karen Garvey.

14:44.585 --> 14:45.886
I don't think
I know the name.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.053
I don't think you ever did,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.755
but that certainly
didn't stop you.

14:48.789 --> 14:50.023
You know, I have
to be honest with you,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.257
I'm kind of losing
interest here.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.126
You broke into her house.
BROWN: All right.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.529
You...
BROWN: It's official.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.797
I'm actually bored.

14:58.532 --> 14:59.399
All right.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.667
Then let me see if I can try

15:00.701 --> 15:02.869
to get your attention.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.071
Your DNA was found
at the crime scene.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.109
Hmm.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.111
GAMBLE: That's right.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.647
Your semen was found
inside the victim.

15:18.719 --> 15:19.853
It's funny, Mr. Brown.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.221
You don't look so bored anymore.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.123
You just look guilty.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.459
What do you want?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.766
I wanna know
what happened.

15:32.799 --> 15:33.600
Forget it.

15:33.634 --> 15:35.602
You got a case, make it,

15:35.636 --> 15:37.303
but you're not gonna get
a thing from me.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.172
Fine.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.207
Tomorrow morning,
my office will charge you

15:41.241 --> 15:43.009
with raping Karen Garvey.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.511
You'll be stupid,
demand a trial,

15:44.545 --> 15:45.411
which you'll lose,

15:45.445 --> 15:46.680
and a judge will sentence you

15:46.713 --> 15:47.781
to 20 years.

15:47.814 --> 15:48.782
Are you done?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.383
Do I look done?

15:52.786 --> 15:55.255
We'll also charged you
with raping Amy Henley.

15:56.690 --> 15:57.791
Who's that?

15:57.824 --> 15:59.593
It's the wrong time
to insult me, Mr. Brown.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.294
I am giving you a chance

16:01.327 --> 16:02.763
to earn my respect.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.731
Another man was convicted

16:04.765 --> 16:05.666
for both these rapes.

16:05.699 --> 16:07.100
He has been in jail

16:07.133 --> 16:08.268
for seven years.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.503
You could tell the truth

16:09.536 --> 16:11.772
and let this man go home
to his family.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.543
I have never raped anyone

16:16.577 --> 16:18.444
in my entire life.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.947
An innocent man

16:20.981 --> 16:22.616
is sitting in prison.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.452
Try and get this,
Ms. Gamble.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.122
I don't care.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.126
I wouldn't have care
seven years ago

16:33.159 --> 16:35.128
and I don't care now.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.403
HATCHER: Hello?
Don't we answer pages anymore?

16:43.436 --> 16:45.506
Why?
HATCHER: He's in your office.

16:45.539 --> 16:47.307
Who?
HATCHER: Russell Hampton.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.042
He's been in there
like an hour.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.310
Well, at least,
he's not dead.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.083
Where the hell have you been?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.719
Didn't know where else to go.

16:58.752 --> 16:59.986
YOUNG: What happened?

17:00.020 --> 17:02.355
RUSSELL: I meant to be
at the trial, I just--

17:02.388 --> 17:04.825
things just got a little
out of control.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.792
It's not just about
the trial anymore.

17:07.993 --> 17:10.096
The police want to talk to you
about Derek Grant.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.200
Why would the police connect me
to Derek Grant?

17:16.136 --> 17:18.338
Because I told them to.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.940
You what?
DONNELL: I don't know

17:19.973 --> 17:21.107
what else to do.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.876
You said you would be
in court at 9:00.

17:22.909 --> 17:23.910
When you didn't show--

17:25.278 --> 17:27.380
you gave me
specific instructions.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.583
You ordered me
to tell the police.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.652
If I was dead?
I thought you were dead.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.520
Well, don't you think
you should have made sure.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.255
Bobby, you just give me up
for a murder.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.490
DONNELL: All they wanna do
is talk to you, Russell.

17:38.759 --> 17:40.060
I don't believe this.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.963
I got to get myself
out of Boston.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.631
YOUNG: Hold on.
RUSSELL: (groans)

17:53.239 --> 17:54.575
What happened to you?

17:54.608 --> 17:56.476
What do you think?

17:57.578 --> 17:58.645
I got shot.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.347
You need to get
to the hospital.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.516
I'm fine.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.588
Look, I don't know
what happened, okay?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.456
I went to see Grant.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.827
We were talking and I thought

18:13.860 --> 18:15.095
I'm okay.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.963
You know,
he doesn't know it's me.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.900
Next thing I know,
he just started shooting.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.335
DONNELL: Uh, all right.
Look, if it was self-defense...

18:22.368 --> 18:23.870
RUSSELL: How can you explain it?

18:23.904 --> 18:25.539
It's like a--it's like something
just snapped in my head.

18:25.572 --> 18:26.206
It's...

18:26.239 --> 18:28.341
Russell, listen to me.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.077
I told them you weren't here.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.112
DONNELL: Who?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.716
Russell Hampton,
you're under arrest

18:35.749 --> 18:37.450
for the murder
of Derek Grant.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.085
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.087
Anything you say,
can and will be used against you

18:41.121 --> 18:42.355
in the court of law.

18:42.388 --> 18:43.524
You have the right
to an attorney.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.490
If you cannot afford one,

18:44.525 --> 18:46.660
one will be appointed for you.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.794
You understand these rights?

18:52.666 --> 18:54.100
GAMBLE: I'm sorry,
Mrs. Garvey.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.703
The results were confirmed.
That it's a mistake.

18:56.737 --> 18:58.338
GAMBLE: Well, if there were
any chance of that,

18:58.371 --> 18:59.205
I wouldn't be here.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.841
There's no mistake.

19:00.874 --> 19:01.908
The man you identified

19:01.942 --> 19:03.577
is not the man who raped you.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.778
It's just--

19:04.811 --> 19:06.713
it doesn't make sense

19:06.747 --> 19:08.615
when it happened--
while it happened,

19:08.649 --> 19:10.617
I studied his face.
I knew how important

19:10.651 --> 19:11.685
it would be to remember.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.487
Mrs. Garvey, you were shown
a photo array.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.989
Uh, some experts think

19:16.022 --> 19:17.524
that this puts
too much pressure

19:17.558 --> 19:18.825
on the victim to pick out one

19:18.859 --> 19:20.761
that looks most like
the attacker.

19:20.794 --> 19:21.895
That's not what happened.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.229
I know it was him.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.237
His name is Gavin Brown

19:31.271 --> 19:34.307
and he looks a little like
the man you identified.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.751
Another victim

19:44.785 --> 19:46.286
identify him too.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.089
And she was also
likely mistaken.

19:52.626 --> 19:53.794
HENLEY: I am not mistaken.

19:53.827 --> 19:55.195
This is not the man.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.963
Please, Ms. Henley,

19:56.997 --> 19:58.231
take another look.

19:58.264 --> 19:59.399
There is a resemblance.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.134
I know the man who raped me,
Ms. Gamble.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.869
This isn't him.

20:02.903 --> 20:04.070
That's what Karen Garvey said,

20:04.104 --> 20:05.371
and until this morning,

20:05.405 --> 20:07.007
she was a hundred percent sure

20:07.040 --> 20:08.709
that the right man
was in prison.

20:08.742 --> 20:11.645
Now, we're a hundred percent
sure she's wrong.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.882
Did the DNA clear Daniel Glenn
of my rape?

20:15.916 --> 20:17.984
No. The sample in yours

20:18.018 --> 20:19.820
was too degraded
to be tested.

20:22.188 --> 20:23.489
Daniel Glenn

20:23.524 --> 20:25.659
is the one who raped me.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.094
Maybe this man
raped Karen Garvey.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.697
Ms. Henley,

20:32.165 --> 20:34.034
Daniel Glenn did landscaping

20:34.067 --> 20:36.036
for both you and Karen Garvey.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.304
We think that's how
you knew him.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.674
Now, when the police
showed you photos

20:40.707 --> 20:41.542
at the precinct,

20:41.575 --> 20:42.676
you both picked him out

20:42.709 --> 20:44.277
because he looked familiar.

20:44.310 --> 20:47.380
I was raped for over an hour.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.883
The man responsible
was inches away.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.585
I know you believe

20:51.618 --> 20:52.786
it was Daniel Glenn.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.655
Oh, you don't think I'm sure?

20:54.688 --> 20:58.091
(music playing)

21:04.230 --> 21:05.966
After he cut me,

21:05.999 --> 21:08.268
he licked my blood
off the knife.

21:10.070 --> 21:12.438
I can still see
his face as he...

21:15.809 --> 21:18.444
With all due respect,

21:18.478 --> 21:21.515
you never testified
to that at trial.

21:22.816 --> 21:25.786
I couldn't even bring myself
to remember it at trial,

21:27.087 --> 21:29.189
but I remember it now.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.892
And I remember the face
of the man who did it.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.561
It was Daniel Glenn.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.170
MAN: Commonwealth versus
Russell Hampton

21:44.204 --> 21:46.172
on the charge of murder
in the first degree.

21:46.206 --> 21:47.974
DONNELL: We're ready
to plead not guilty.

21:48.909 --> 21:51.077
WEEKS: Well, Mr. Hampton,
now I understand

21:51.111 --> 21:53.413
why you didn't wanna show up
for trial,

21:53.446 --> 21:54.280
you've been busy.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.549
I object to that.

21:55.582 --> 21:56.517
WEEKS: I apologize.

21:56.550 --> 21:58.451
No bail.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.621
We'll set a trial date
for March 10th.

22:00.654 --> 22:01.722
Put him back in lock up.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.357
Your Honor, the Commonwealth
is seeking a blood sample

22:04.390 --> 22:05.325
from this defendant.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.227
On what grounds?
There was blood found

22:07.260 --> 22:09.362
at the crime scene,
as well as on the victim.

22:09.395 --> 22:10.463
We believe the blood
may have come

22:10.496 --> 22:11.397
from the defendant.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.733
They have no legal basis

22:12.766 --> 22:14.300
to make that connection.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.136
In fact, I don't know
what the probable cause is

22:16.169 --> 22:18.104
to even connect my client
to the crime.

22:18.138 --> 22:19.573
Well, the suspect's life
was in danger.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.608
We were told that
by Mr. Donnell.

22:21.642 --> 22:23.076
Mr. Donnell also requested

22:23.109 --> 22:24.811
that we question the victim

22:24.845 --> 22:26.780
and connects him with
the suspect's disappearance,

22:26.813 --> 22:29.415
and the suspect has a wound.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.184
Something tells us
the suspect's blood

22:31.217 --> 22:32.853
might be found near the victim.

22:32.886 --> 22:34.254
DONNELL: They're using
privileged information.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.022
You waived it.
I don't have the authority

22:36.056 --> 22:37.691
to waive it.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.025
It was my mistake.

22:39.059 --> 22:41.027
WEEKS: But the Commonwealth
shouldn't be penalized for it,

22:41.061 --> 22:41.962
Mr. Donnell.

22:41.995 --> 22:44.998
I'm ordering the warrant
for the blood test.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.733
In the future council,

22:46.767 --> 22:48.502
you might not wanna tip
the police off

22:48.535 --> 22:49.770
to your client's crimes.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.005
Adjourned.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.612
(door opens)

23:01.481 --> 23:02.516
Have a seat.

23:07.287 --> 23:08.955
I'm not getting a good feeling.

23:11.424 --> 23:12.993
We're clearing Daniel Glenn

23:13.026 --> 23:14.494
on the rape of Karen Garvey,

23:16.697 --> 23:18.532
and we will agree
to a new trial

23:18.565 --> 23:20.534
on the rape of Amy Henley.

23:22.536 --> 23:24.437
What?
GAMBLE: Lindsay, it's possible

23:24.470 --> 23:25.706
these two rapes were committed

23:25.739 --> 23:27.007
by two different men.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.408
You've got to be kidding.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.511
GAMBLE: Amy Henley is positive
that you're client...

23:30.544 --> 23:32.078
DOLE: Karen Garvey was positive.

23:32.112 --> 23:34.280
Witnesses are positive
all the time.

23:34.314 --> 23:36.583
GAMBLE: Gavin Brown also denies
the Henley rape. If we...

23:36.617 --> 23:37.818
DOLE: Oh, great.
Let's take his word.

23:37.851 --> 23:41.021
Lindsay.
DOLE: Oh, come on, Helen.

23:41.054 --> 23:42.523
This is politics.

23:42.556 --> 23:43.924
You know, Daniel Glenn
is innocent.

23:43.957 --> 23:45.158
We don't know.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.159
Is this your call?

23:46.192 --> 23:47.694
Look,

23:47.728 --> 23:49.162
Lindsay, I don't wanna fight.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.463
I'll asked you a question,
Helen.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.832
Is this your call?

23:51.865 --> 23:53.800
No, it comes from above.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.570
Lindsay, the fact is

23:56.603 --> 23:58.672
we don't know
Daniel Glenn is innocent.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.874
If we did,
things might be different.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.275
DOLE: You know.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.712
You know.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.417
(music playing)

24:12.586 --> 24:14.087
RUSSELL: You gave me up.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.857
DONNELL: I didn't give you up.
RUSSELL: You told the police.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.525
Russell, I thought
you were dead.

24:18.559 --> 24:20.861
You said if you were taken out
to go the police.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.095
Uh, I thought...

24:23.864 --> 24:25.666
Look, there's a possibility
we can suppress

24:25.699 --> 24:27.067
what I told them.
If so...

24:27.100 --> 24:29.670
You told the police I was
at your office, didn't you?

24:29.703 --> 24:31.638
You stalled me and you...

24:31.672 --> 24:33.239
and you gave them time
to arrest me.

24:33.273 --> 24:35.141
Of course,
I didn't do that.

24:35.175 --> 24:38.078
Russell, we thought
Derek Grant killed you.

24:38.111 --> 24:39.179
We're on your side.

24:39.212 --> 24:40.981
So what happens now?

24:43.216 --> 24:45.285
Bobby and I are gonna do
some research.

24:45.318 --> 24:46.920
We'll come back to you
with a plan.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.955
How do I stay safe?

24:51.291 --> 24:53.226
Derek Grant
has a lot of friends

24:53.259 --> 24:54.828
that could take me out
right in here.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.296
This place is guarded.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.798
They won't get in here.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.201
You gave me up.

25:01.234 --> 25:03.537
We didn't give you up.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.210
(indistinct chatter)

25:10.243 --> 25:11.277
DONNELL: The question is,

25:11.311 --> 25:14.180
since privilege
is the client's right to assert,

25:14.214 --> 25:16.817
if the lawyer reveals
privileged information,

25:16.850 --> 25:18.384
can the client
still prevent it

25:18.418 --> 25:19.653
from being used against him?

25:19.686 --> 25:22.155
But if the client gave
permission to waive privilege...

25:22.188 --> 25:23.657
DONNELL: We'll challenge
whether he did that.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.658
Jimmy help Rebecca.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.292
Ellenor, I like you
to pitch in too.

25:26.326 --> 25:27.293
FRUTT: I'm working
on the Morris case.

25:27.327 --> 25:28.529
DONNELL:
Drop whatever else you got.

25:28.562 --> 25:30.496
We just succeeded
in getting our client

25:30.531 --> 25:32.799
arrested for murder.

25:32.833 --> 25:33.900
That's bad for business.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.468
I want everybody on it.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.942
DOLE: The first victim

25:41.975 --> 25:44.410
insists she made the right ID.

25:44.444 --> 25:45.612
DANIEL: (sighs)

25:45.646 --> 25:47.581
How can this be?

25:47.614 --> 25:50.350
DOLE: Sometimes the victim
becomes invested

25:50.383 --> 25:51.417
in the ID.

25:51.451 --> 25:52.853
They want it to be him.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.287
The police tell her it's him,

25:54.320 --> 25:56.122
so in her mind,

25:56.156 --> 25:57.924
she starts playing along.

25:57.958 --> 25:59.993
She starts putting his face

26:00.026 --> 26:01.094
into those memories.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.797
It's called
retroactive interference.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.166
I've got doctors
who can testify to it.

26:06.199 --> 26:08.935
Where were those doctors
at my first trial?

26:09.870 --> 26:11.037
Well,

26:12.606 --> 26:14.207
they'll be at this one.

26:14.975 --> 26:16.242
So I'm gonna be prosecuted

26:16.276 --> 26:17.678
all over again.

26:17.711 --> 26:19.212
DOLE: Unfortunately, yes.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.582
The DA's office
doesn't know you're innocent.

26:21.615 --> 26:23.216
And without being able
to prove that you are

26:23.249 --> 26:24.651
there's no...

26:26.019 --> 26:27.387
What?

26:27.420 --> 26:30.791
There is someone who can prove
you're innocent.

26:30.824 --> 26:32.225
DANIEL: Who?

26:32.258 --> 26:33.594
Gavin Brown.

26:35.629 --> 26:37.130
Do I look that crazy?

26:37.163 --> 26:39.499
DOLE: Daniel Glenn got 40 years
for something you did.

26:39.533 --> 26:41.568
Yeah. And children are starving
to death in Crapistan.

26:41.602 --> 26:43.069
My father
never hugged me enough.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.071
DOLE: Mr. Brown...
BROWN: What? I'm not interested.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.341
I know why you're here
and I don't care.

26:50.010 --> 26:51.612
Let's talk self-interest.

26:52.913 --> 26:54.280
Yours or mine.

26:55.148 --> 26:56.149
Yours.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.122
They have DNA
on the Garvey rape.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.658
That means 20 years

27:04.691 --> 27:05.859
maybe more.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.662
I might know a way
you could do less time.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.863
I'm listening.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.665
You'd need to confess

27:11.698 --> 27:13.433
to the Amy Henley rape.

27:14.434 --> 27:16.302
Confess to a rape
the DA can't prove?

27:16.336 --> 27:18.038
That's how you think
I'll do less time?

27:18.071 --> 27:19.840
Yes.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.844
The DA will reduce
my sentence

27:23.877 --> 27:25.912
if I confess
to another rape?

27:25.946 --> 27:28.048
The DA might reduce
your sentence

27:28.081 --> 27:30.283
for letting an innocent man
go free.

27:31.351 --> 27:33.687
You have something
the DA wants.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.355
And that is?

27:35.388 --> 27:37.323
The truth.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.094
So I get a complete pass

27:41.127 --> 27:42.729
on rape number one?

27:42.763 --> 27:43.764
DOLE: Yes.

27:43.797 --> 27:45.165
And a reduced sentence

27:45.198 --> 27:46.700
for rape number two.

27:47.534 --> 27:49.636
Why would the DA
ever go along with that?

27:52.405 --> 27:54.007
GAMBLE: Good question.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.509
We can get 20 years

27:55.542 --> 27:57.177
for the rape we can prove.

27:57.210 --> 27:58.945
I'm not giving him less time

27:58.979 --> 28:01.515
for admitting he raped
another woman.

28:01.548 --> 28:03.750
DOLE: Helen,
you can try Gavin Brown,

28:03.784 --> 28:05.886
use the DNA,
get your 20 years.

28:05.919 --> 28:07.253
Then you can retrial
Daniel Glenn,

28:07.287 --> 28:08.589
and, hey, you might
even win there too.

28:08.622 --> 28:10.957
You'll get
everything you want,

28:10.991 --> 28:12.325
except the truth.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.561
You think you know
what the truth is, Lindsay?

28:14.595 --> 28:16.530
Gavin Brown does,

28:16.563 --> 28:17.664
and he's willing
to trade it

28:17.698 --> 28:18.732
in exchange for a deal.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.066
It's not that simple.

28:20.100 --> 28:21.334
Why can't it be?

28:25.371 --> 28:26.940
Look,

28:26.973 --> 28:29.475
all I'm asking
is that you hear him out.

28:29.510 --> 28:30.544
If you think he's lying,

28:30.577 --> 28:31.812
call it off and try them both.

28:31.845 --> 28:32.879
But if you believe him,

28:32.913 --> 28:35.616
if he convinces you he's guilty,

28:35.649 --> 28:37.283
make the deal

28:37.317 --> 28:38.785
and release my client.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.522
Your office doesn't want
the wrong man in prison

28:41.555 --> 28:42.789
any more than I do.

28:42.823 --> 28:44.958
Look, I was willing
to do you a favor.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.259
Well, then do me another one.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.599
I took the thing
court-appointed.

28:52.633 --> 28:55.235
It was a three-day trial
for two rapes.

28:56.970 --> 28:58.171
I should have...

28:59.673 --> 29:01.374
(sighs)

29:03.744 --> 29:06.312
Lindsay,
get Mr. Brown a lawyer.

29:06.346 --> 29:07.614
If he can prove
he's guilty,

29:07.648 --> 29:09.282
I'll make a deal.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.152
I'm not just accepting
a confession.

29:12.185 --> 29:15.121
(music playing)

29:24.531 --> 29:26.533
He did it, Ms. Dole.

29:26.567 --> 29:27.934
He'll have enough specifics,

29:27.968 --> 29:29.035
how could he not?

29:29.069 --> 29:30.904
It was seven years ago,

29:30.937 --> 29:32.405
and from his demeanor,

29:32.438 --> 29:34.340
he probably forgot
about raping Amy Henley

29:34.374 --> 29:36.476
ten minutes
after he did it.

29:36.510 --> 29:39.145
We are making progress,
Daniel.

29:39.179 --> 29:41.214
We just can't get
our hopes up.

29:43.517 --> 29:45.051
Thank you for trying.

29:47.654 --> 29:49.322
Let's just hope it works.

29:55.128 --> 29:56.563
(door opens)

30:02.368 --> 30:04.237
DONNELL: You warned me
not to go forward.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.675
All these days
I listened to you.

30:08.709 --> 30:10.243
He instructed you
to go forward

30:10.276 --> 30:12.078
if he were killed.

30:12.112 --> 30:13.880
Which he wasn't.

30:15.616 --> 30:17.283
Russell Hampton is responsible

30:17.317 --> 30:19.452
for his situation, Bobby.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.222
He murdered two people.

30:25.491 --> 30:26.727
But he's in custody

30:26.760 --> 30:28.494
because his own lawyer

30:31.464 --> 30:32.666
gave him up.

30:34.367 --> 30:37.303
(music playing)

30:47.848 --> 30:49.049
(sighs) This is it?

30:49.082 --> 30:50.751
We're still checking
the other jurisdictions.

30:50.784 --> 30:51.785
This doesn't help me.

30:51.818 --> 30:52.719
FRUTT:
That's the research, Bobby.

30:52.753 --> 30:54.154
Don't blame
the researchers.

30:54.187 --> 30:55.188
DONNELL: I got to be able
to tell them something

30:55.221 --> 30:56.022
more than this.

30:56.056 --> 30:57.524
We'll keep looking.

30:58.959 --> 31:01.061
Tell Eugene I'm going
to see the client.

31:01.094 --> 31:03.463
(door opens)

31:03.496 --> 31:05.231
I don't think he liked
the research.

31:09.269 --> 31:11.337
I've read the agreement.

31:11.371 --> 31:13.039
Just so we're clear,

31:13.073 --> 31:15.341
he gets 10 years
in full satisfaction

31:15.375 --> 31:17.544
for both crimes.

31:17.578 --> 31:20.113
Provided we believe
he's telling the truth.

31:20.146 --> 31:22.382
That's pretty subjective.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.618
How do we know
you'll live up to your end?

31:24.651 --> 31:27.487
GAMBLE: Because, Mr. Palmer,
I gave you my word.

31:27.521 --> 31:29.155
PALMER: With all due respect,
Ms. Gamble,

31:29.189 --> 31:32.659
you've tried to back out
of these deals before.

31:32.693 --> 31:34.561
I'm gonna need
more than just your word.

31:34.595 --> 31:35.762
Then take mine.

31:40.867 --> 31:42.703
We have a deal, Council,

31:42.736 --> 31:44.137
let's get it done.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.714
You already know
about Karen Garvey.

31:54.815 --> 31:56.482
I can't really argue
with DNA.

31:57.684 --> 31:59.119
Well, get
to Karen Garvey later.

31:59.152 --> 32:01.254
Tell us how you raped
Amy Henley.

32:02.355 --> 32:03.790
She was my first.

32:06.026 --> 32:07.493
Back then I was...

32:07.528 --> 32:09.229
strictly a burglary guy.

32:10.597 --> 32:12.332
I'd scope up these houses

32:12.365 --> 32:15.035
and I'd try to make sure
people weren't home.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.537
And I'd get inside,
take a look around.

32:16.570 --> 32:18.839
But, well,

32:21.074 --> 32:23.510
a couple of times
it turns out I was wrong,

32:23.544 --> 32:25.345
and I get inside, and...

32:26.580 --> 32:28.949
find a woman
who's sleeping upstairs.

32:29.683 --> 32:32.318
Is that how you found
Amy Henley?

32:32.352 --> 32:35.488
There's a lot of women
I never touched.

32:35.522 --> 32:37.991
I was standing right above them
and they never knew.

32:40.060 --> 32:41.461
And after a while, I...

32:42.929 --> 32:44.765
start thinking
about doing things.

32:46.099 --> 32:47.133
But...

32:48.669 --> 32:49.670
Amy,

32:51.337 --> 32:52.873
she was just my first.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.977
We need to know
what happened, Mr. Brown.

32:57.010 --> 32:59.112
I raped her.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.447
How did you get inside
the house?

33:04.284 --> 33:06.186
(scoffs) It's, uh...

33:06.219 --> 33:07.921
it's seven years ago. I...

33:07.954 --> 33:10.456
Does that mean
you don't remember?

33:10.490 --> 33:12.859
No, I don't. No.
Uh, maybe I, uh...

33:12.893 --> 33:15.562
I think I went around back
and found a way in.

33:15.596 --> 33:16.763
WALSH:
The details escape you.

33:16.797 --> 33:18.331
Uh, that detail? Yes.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.901
So you have no recollection.

33:20.934 --> 33:21.935
BROWN: Look,
that's what I did.

33:21.968 --> 33:23.770
I broke into houses.
Uh, most of the time, uh,

33:23.804 --> 33:25.972
I'd punch out a window
or if I could,

33:26.006 --> 33:27.774
I'd pick the lock.
But...

33:27.808 --> 33:29.009
I didn't keep a log

33:29.042 --> 33:30.577
of which house was what.

33:32.546 --> 33:34.180
We're listening.

33:34.214 --> 33:37.183
(music playing)

33:38.251 --> 33:39.219
I raped her.

33:39.252 --> 33:40.286
Where?

33:41.421 --> 33:43.056
In the bedroom,
I already told you that.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.190
Weapon?

33:44.224 --> 33:46.259
BROWN: Knife,
a folding knife.

33:49.095 --> 33:51.497
Did you stab or injured her
with the knife?

33:51.532 --> 33:52.465
No.

33:55.135 --> 33:56.336
Oh,

33:57.571 --> 33:59.339
uh,

33:59.372 --> 34:01.207
I don't know
if it was her or Garvey,

34:01.241 --> 34:03.043
but I cut her.

34:03.076 --> 34:04.678
I cut her chest a little.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.614
You cut her chest?

34:07.648 --> 34:10.516
And I licked the blood
off the blade.

34:12.085 --> 34:13.520
Don't know why.

34:15.288 --> 34:17.322
Maybe I was just crazy.

34:34.474 --> 34:35.942
It was Brown.

34:39.012 --> 34:40.045
Deal was made.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.081
Your client
will be released today.

34:45.819 --> 34:47.120
Thank you.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.489
My office thanks you.

34:49.523 --> 34:52.559
I guess sometimes justice
is a team effort, huh, Lindsay?

34:54.928 --> 34:56.329
I better go tell him.

34:57.798 --> 34:58.765
Congratulations, Lindsay.

34:58.799 --> 34:59.900
Thanks.

34:59.933 --> 35:01.935
I owe you, Helen.

35:03.169 --> 35:04.370
I owe you.

35:04.404 --> 35:07.340
(music playing)

35:11.745 --> 35:13.046
What about an appeal?

35:13.079 --> 35:15.516
We can try, but to be honest,
I don't think it'll work.

35:15.549 --> 35:16.750
It's my blood, Bobby.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.519
When the test come back
they'll know I killed him.

35:18.552 --> 35:20.220
All the blood does
is put you at the scene.

35:20.253 --> 35:21.655
It doesn't prove
you killed anyone.

35:21.688 --> 35:22.856
What about self-defense?

35:22.889 --> 35:24.390
You said we could argue
self-defense.

35:24.424 --> 35:25.759
And we will.
That's a winner, right?

35:25.792 --> 35:28.261
Because this guy--this guy
was gonna kill me, Bobby.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.664
The problem, you knew
that meeting might get violent,

35:30.697 --> 35:31.798
you went there with a gun.

35:31.832 --> 35:33.600
(sighs)

35:33.634 --> 35:34.635
It's your fault.

35:36.269 --> 35:37.538
When this started,
all they had

35:37.571 --> 35:38.739
was a dying bag of crack.

35:38.772 --> 35:40.373
Now, they'll gonna charge me
with murder.

35:40.406 --> 35:41.975
You told me
to go forward if...

35:42.008 --> 35:43.176
RUSSELL: If I was dead.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.111
Do I look dead?
Hey, they couldn't charge you

35:45.145 --> 35:46.813
with murder if you didn't
keep killing people.

35:46.847 --> 35:48.214
You gave me up.

35:48.248 --> 35:49.950
Shut up, Russell,
and just listen.

35:51.284 --> 35:54.054
I think
we should consider insanity.

35:54.087 --> 35:55.689
What?
DONNELL: You said it yourself,

35:55.722 --> 35:56.757
something snapped.

35:56.790 --> 35:58.224
You felt as though
you flipped a switch.

35:58.258 --> 36:00.260
No, I am not crazy.
You are out of control.

36:00.293 --> 36:01.862
Now, this is your fault, Bobby.
DONNELL: We can make a showing

36:01.895 --> 36:03.096
that you couldn't distinguish

36:03.129 --> 36:04.297
right from wrong.
RUSSELL: No. I trusted you.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.032
And look what you...
(grunts)

36:06.066 --> 36:07.601
RUSSELL: (grunts)

36:07.634 --> 36:10.571
(music playing)

36:29.756 --> 36:30.924
OFFICER: Okay. Okay.

36:30.957 --> 36:33.059
Code red.

36:33.093 --> 36:33.794
Code red.

36:33.827 --> 36:34.661
Code red.

36:34.695 --> 36:38.264
C-block, 514-514.

37:26.112 --> 37:27.714
OFFICER: Get in there,
get up now.

37:27.748 --> 37:29.516
OFFICER: Let go.

37:42.195 --> 37:45.131
(indistinct chatter)

37:48.902 --> 37:51.304
OFFICER: Get him.
OFFICER: Cuff him.

37:52.405 --> 37:53.974
Come on.
Hold him. Hold him.

37:54.007 --> 37:54.675
Get him up.

37:56.376 --> 37:57.711
Take him up.
OFFICER: Okay, let's go.

37:59.813 --> 38:01.481
Let's go. Get him.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.586
Get a medic now.

38:05.619 --> 38:06.587
Go get a doctor.

38:15.195 --> 38:17.130
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Collin to CCU.

38:17.163 --> 38:18.599
YOUNG: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:18.632 --> 38:20.801
Where is he?
YOUNG: He's okay.

38:20.834 --> 38:22.503
He's bruised
and he's shaken up,

38:22.536 --> 38:24.370
but he's okay.

38:24.404 --> 38:25.238
Where's Lindsay?

38:25.271 --> 38:26.472
I couldn't reach her.

38:27.608 --> 38:28.842
All right. Well,

38:28.875 --> 38:30.243
let's just keep it
together in there.

38:30.276 --> 38:32.478
He doesn't need to see us
come apart.

38:39.753 --> 38:41.822
Hey.
DONNELL: Hey.

38:43.089 --> 38:44.090
Are you okay?

38:44.124 --> 38:45.659
I'm fine.

38:47.260 --> 38:49.495
Well, how's the other guy look?

38:53.066 --> 38:54.868
They'll let me out tomorrow.

38:54.901 --> 38:56.469
I talked to the court.

38:56.503 --> 38:57.804
And they've assigned
Russell Hampton

38:57.838 --> 38:59.239
to another lawyer.

39:01.107 --> 39:02.609
Look, guys,

39:02.643 --> 39:04.144
I'm okay.

39:05.245 --> 39:06.412
I talked to the cops and--
FRUTT: The doctor said

39:06.446 --> 39:07.447
he was gonna let you out
tomorrow?

39:07.480 --> 39:09.683
YOUNG: Let's not everybody
talk at once, okay?

39:12.986 --> 39:14.387
Listen, Bobby,

39:14.420 --> 39:15.522
you should get some rest.

39:15.556 --> 39:17.524
I'm fine.

39:17.558 --> 39:19.760
You don't need to worry, okay?

39:35.308 --> 39:37.410
Look at this.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.845
I can fit my entire life

39:38.879 --> 39:40.747
into one cardboard box.

39:42.015 --> 39:43.550
What are you gonna do,
Daniel?

39:43.584 --> 39:45.786
Have you thought about work
or where you'll live?

39:45.819 --> 39:47.287
No, not really.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.956
I, um--I have some family
in New York.

39:52.058 --> 39:53.994
Listen, uh, Ms. Dole,

39:55.428 --> 39:57.598
I said before, you know,

39:57.631 --> 39:59.733
how it stuck with me,

39:59.766 --> 40:01.201
how much you cared,

40:03.069 --> 40:04.104
but, uh,

40:04.137 --> 40:05.672
I never...

40:07.974 --> 40:09.275
What do you say to a person

40:09.309 --> 40:12.278
who just gave you
your life back?

40:12.312 --> 40:15.248
(music playing)

40:17.684 --> 40:18.819
Uh,

40:18.852 --> 40:21.054
why are you looking
at me funny?

40:22.823 --> 40:24.424
The truth is,

40:26.527 --> 40:27.928
I didn't care.

40:29.996 --> 40:31.632
At least, not enough.

40:31.665 --> 40:34.668
I put on a day-and-a-half
defense for two rapes.

40:34.701 --> 40:35.736
I, um...

40:37.604 --> 40:40.006
those victims, they...

40:40.040 --> 40:42.776
they didn't just convinced
themselves

40:42.809 --> 40:45.245
you were the guy,
or the jury,

40:48.649 --> 40:50.316
they convinced me as well.

40:53.219 --> 40:54.988
It wasn't malpractice,

40:56.189 --> 40:58.391
I gave it the old
three-day college try,

41:02.729 --> 41:04.297
but that's all you got.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.434
I'm not the lawyer

41:08.468 --> 41:10.604
who gave you
your life back.

41:10.637 --> 41:12.906
I'm the one that helped you
lose seven years of it.

41:16.009 --> 41:18.478
So should you sue me,

41:20.180 --> 41:21.414
I'm sure my carrier
would work out

41:21.447 --> 41:23.316
some sort of settlement,

41:23.349 --> 41:24.651
and I never said that.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.522
So, uh,

41:30.423 --> 41:31.592
until we meet again.

41:33.026 --> 41:35.962
(music playing)

42:00.954 --> 42:03.890
(music playing)

42:27.313 --> 42:28.381
You stinker!

42:28.414 --> 42:30.817
