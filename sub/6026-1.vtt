WEBVTT

00:18.200 --> 00:20.407
Ooh, fuck. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.244
Whoa. You okay there, Richard?

00:22.360 --> 00:24.203
Uh... Yeah, I'm fine.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.009
Sorry, I can't really throw it any slower.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.320
Give it another cut, Richard.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.164
No, I'm fine. I don't want to.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.130
Maybe someone else wants to. Who's next?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.885
If someone has to go, I'll go,
but it seems very frightening.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.689
You sure? You got us for the whole hour.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.128
- Anyone?
- Would it hurt your feelings if no one went?

00:42.720 --> 00:44.006
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:44.080 --> 00:47.050
welcome to the annual
Stern Taylor Fall Classic.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.010
I'd like to start by making a toast
to our very special guest tonight,

00:50.080 --> 00:52.731
Richard Hendricks.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.567
Richard, after your perfect game
at TechCrunch Disrupt a few weeks ago,

00:57.640 --> 00:59.404
we fell in love with you and your tech.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.648
Look, we know everyone
in the Valley is after you,

01:02.280 --> 01:06.251
and we know that you're probably
going to go with Peter Gregory,

01:06.320 --> 01:08.891
but we'd love to have you
come play on our team.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.962
Let Stern Taylor Capital Fund in

01:11.040 --> 01:14.328
on your Series A financing,
because together, Richard,

01:14.400 --> 01:15.890
we'd be

01:15.960 --> 01:19.169
a home run!

01:19.240 --> 01:21.971
{APPLAUSE

01:22.120 --> 01:23.849
- Oh, fight.
- What do you say, Richard?

01:26.600 --> 01:28.125
I'll do what I can.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.524
All right. Have fun, everybody.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.521
I don't know, man.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.046
It's starting to feel weird
letting all these firms suck up to us,

01:38.160 --> 01:39.924
even though we're not gonna
take their money.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.607
Richard, Peter Gregory hasn't officially
given us the term sheet yet.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.762
Yes, but he will tomorrow
when he gets back.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.765
If you can't enjoy this many people
kissing our ass at this level,

01:49.880 --> 01:51.006
then I feel sorry for you.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.531
Would you just relax
and take it in for a second?

01:54.600 --> 01:58.207
I mean, we are getting our dicks sucked
at the AT&T Park.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.723
We're standing on the field of
the World Series champions.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.801
It's totally lost on me.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.564
Yeah, I don't give a shit, either.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.484
Hey! I'm Nicole Stein.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.449
I lead the Growth Team at Stern Taylor.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.603
- Oh. I'm Dinesh.
- I'm Gilfoyle.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.365
I love it. So what do you
two do at Pied Piper?

02:17.440 --> 02:19.124
I'm the CTO.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.720
Ah, he's joking. I'm the CTO.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.325
Fuck you, I'm joking.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.607
Okay, how could you be
the Chief Technology Officer?

02:25.680 --> 02:30.083
I get it. You hear the word "chief,"
and you think "Indian Chief."

02:30.160 --> 02:31.491
But you're the other kind of Indian.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.086
Okay. One, fuck you. I'm Pakistani.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.527
And two, how could you be CTO of anything?

02:36.600 --> 02:37.886
You have to be able to organize,

02:37.960 --> 02:39.485
you have to be able to delegate,
you have to be...

02:39.560 --> 02:42.006
I delegate you to go get me a fucking beer

02:42.080 --> 02:43.684
while I talk to Nicole.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.244
George Silver,
operating partner at Stern Taylor.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.611
So, what do you do at Pied Piper?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.250
He's the CTO.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.441
That's Drew Houston.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.921
We've been circling each other
for the last 20 minutes.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.487
Ooh!

03:02.560 --> 03:03.686
The Winklevoss twins.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.809
Look at them. They're like
two genetically enhanced Ken dolls.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.723
Do you know
how much Bitcoin they're worth?

03:09.240 --> 03:10.765
Oh, shit, they're splitting up.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.484
Cameron's the left dominant one, right?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.847
- I can't tell them apart.
- I'm gonna come at him from the right side,

03:15.920 --> 03:18.810
try and herd them back together
without spooking them.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.320
Watch this.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.368
Cameron! Cameron!

03:22.840 --> 03:24.888
- Okay.
- Well, well, well,

03:24.960 --> 03:27.167
look who's the big swinging dick.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.369
Hey, Javeed, everything okay at Goolybib?

03:30.480 --> 03:32.847
You gotta ask them. They canned me.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.809
- What?
- Yeah.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.565
Our investors got spooked
by a possible down round,

03:37.640 --> 03:39.608
so they shoved
an acquisition down my throat.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.889
Yeah, an acquisition of
$200 million, right?

03:42.960 --> 03:46.965
Yeah, they all made out.
I had a reverse vest with no triggers,

03:47.320 --> 03:49.687
then I lost all my shares
when they fired me.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.722
I blew my whole signing bonus
renting that house.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.007
I'm looking into suing 'em.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.971
Jeez.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.008
Look, all I can say is,

03:59.080 --> 04:01.048
don't get fucked, all right?

04:01.120 --> 04:04.442
You take money from the wrong dudes,
and you'll get smoked as bad as I did.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.446
Just be careful.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.170
Everyone is watching you now.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.846
Yeah. Totally. I know. Thanks, Javeed.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.289
No. I mean, they're watching you right now.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.849
Yeah.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.649
Damn it. Where is that camera?

04:33.160 --> 04:34.810
I can't believe
how many gifts we're getting.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.242
Gifts I'm getting.
That Oculus rig is addressed to the CTO.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.970
No, I'm the CTO.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.089
As your superior,
I order you to give me that Oculus.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.927
You can't make me do stuff.
You're not the boss of me.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.764
- Actually, I am the boss of you.
- Okay.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.046
Richard, tell him I'm CTO.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.963
No, you already told that fat guy
that I'm the CTO.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.724
Stop, stop, stop. Please stop.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.609
I have a ton of work to do.
You have work to do.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.728
Maybe let's do the work instead of that.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.561
Jared, we were supposed
to get a term sheet today.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.165
Have we heard from Peter Gregory?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.929
Peter Gregory is dead.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.721
What?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.409
Holy shit.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.122
He was the smartest,

05:28.200 --> 05:31.010
shrewdest,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.560
strangest man I've ever known.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.688
I can't believe that he's gone.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.249
Can I ask what happened?

05:41.360 --> 05:43.124
Yeah. Um...

05:43.200 --> 05:46.044
He was in the Serengeti on safari...

05:46.120 --> 05:48.691
- Ah.
- ...and he had just gone into his tent

05:48.760 --> 05:51.730
when a hippo wandered into the camp.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.565
Oh, wow.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.931
He was attacked by a hippo?

05:56.040 --> 05:57.201
No. No.

05:57.280 --> 06:00.921
I guess the hippo started to charge

06:01.000 --> 06:03.446
when the guide grabbed his rifle
and shot at it,

06:05.120 --> 06:08.203
but his aim was off, and...

06:10.000 --> 06:12.765
And he shot Peter Gregory by accident?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.286
- Yeah.
- No, he missed...

06:16.080 --> 06:19.448
But I guess the sound of the gun
startled Peter,

06:19.520 --> 06:23.002
who ran out of his tent and...

06:25.160 --> 06:26.889
Ran right into the hippo?

06:26.960 --> 06:29.884
No, the hippo was also
startled by the noise

06:30.480 --> 06:34.849
and had run off prior to
Peter exiting his tent.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.644
So, what happened to Peter?

06:41.280 --> 06:45.205
He hadn't run in a long time,

06:46.000 --> 06:50.005
maybe ever, and you know, he just...

06:53.800 --> 06:54.847
That was it.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.207
- Uh.
- Uh.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.841
That is so very strange.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.685
- Very sad and tragic. Wow.
- Very sad and strange.

07:09.360 --> 07:10.885
See you.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.487
Man, that is so weird.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.848
I mean, one minute Peter Gregory is here,
the next, he's just gone.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.126
Jared, it's Erlich.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.283
I need you to set up
all the other VC meetings, ASAP.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.044
Line 'em up nuts to butts.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.771
Erlich, what are you doing? Monica
just said they're still gonna fund us.

07:25.880 --> 07:26.961
We should just sit tight.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.965
Look, I loved Peter Gregory
maybe even more than he loved me,

07:31.040 --> 07:32.280
but there's something
you need to know here,

07:32.360 --> 07:35.364
something that Monica
isn't exactly volunteering up,

07:35.440 --> 07:38.091
and that's that all of these one-man firms
have a key-man clause.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.650
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.200
It means that now that
Peter Gregory is gone,

07:42.280 --> 07:43.691
all the Raviga investors

07:43.760 --> 07:46.604
have the contractual right
to cash out and walk away,

07:46.680 --> 07:50.002
which means that by the end of the day,
there may not be a Raviga.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.651
- Seriously?
- Yes, so we have to prepare for that.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.769
Now, I know that it makes me
sound like a terrible person,

07:55.840 --> 07:57.001
but we have a company to run.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.327
And do you know who
the first person to agree with me would be?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.731
Peter Gregory.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.360
And that is the very first spot
in our new campaign

08:13.440 --> 08:15.408
heralding the upcoming release of Nucleus

08:15.480 --> 08:17.164
this January at CES.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.161
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.241
That was horrible.

08:22.040 --> 08:25.522
I just got humiliated by a fucking
teenager at TechCrunch Disrupt,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.365
and you give me this tampon ad?

08:28.440 --> 08:30.442
A girl with diabetes on a swing?

08:30.520 --> 08:32.443
- I think she has cancer.
- Yeah.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.203
At least that's how I read it.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.804
I don't care what kind of disease she had!

08:35.880 --> 08:40.044
All I care about is that
Nucleus is better than Pied Piper.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.770
Hendricks just left us all in the dust.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.124
If we get this wrong,

08:44.200 --> 08:46.601
we could blow
the business opportunity of a lifetime!

08:46.680 --> 08:49.206
Data creation is exploding.

08:49.280 --> 08:54.161
With all the selfies and useless files
people refuse to delete on the cloud,

08:54.640 --> 08:59.885
92% of the world's data
was created in the last two years alone.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.041
At the current rate,

09:01.120 --> 09:05.170
the world's data storage capacity
will be overtaken by next spring.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.641
It will be nothing short of a catastrophe.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.770
Data shortages, data rationing,
data black markets.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.401
Someone's compression
will save the world from data-geddon,

09:15.480 --> 09:19.121
and it sure as hell better be Nucleus
and not goddamn Pied Piper!

09:20.800 --> 09:22.290
I don't know about you people,

09:22.360 --> 09:23.646
but I don't wanna live in a world

09:23.720 --> 09:27.805
where someone else makes the world
a better place better than we do.

09:33.480 --> 09:37.405
"Data-geddon." Is he married to that, or...

09:37.480 --> 09:39.687
There's just been a lot
of "geddons" lately.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.411
That's true.
"Snow-mageddon," "car-mageddon."

09:42.480 --> 09:44.528
There's that movie Armageddon.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.688
Laurie, you wanted to see me?

09:51.760 --> 09:53.808
Monica, come in, come in.
I'm sure you've heard by now

09:53.880 --> 09:55.723
that I've been named
our new managing partner.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.529
Yes. Congratulations.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.763
Did the limited partners tell you
how they made their decision?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.168
Oh. They looked at the
portfolio performances

10:03.240 --> 10:05.481
of each of the senior partners
over the last several funds,

10:05.560 --> 10:08.086
and my numbers were,
objectively, the most favorable.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.764
Therefore, I was selected.

10:09.840 --> 10:14.482
Yeah, it's just managing partner
is all about meeting with people

10:14.560 --> 10:16.369
and interacting with people.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.329
You can sit down if you want to.
Do you want to?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.050
- Oh...
- Or should we stand?

10:20.280 --> 10:21.964
Uh... I... Whatever...

10:22.040 --> 10:23.041
- I'm standing...
- Okay.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.281
But you don't have to.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.770
- Okay.
- Would it make you feel awkward to sit?

10:27.840 --> 10:29.251
I'm okay to stand.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.086
- Monica...
- Of course.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.090
Peter Gregory is dead.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.804
Yes, I know.

10:37.880 --> 10:42.169
On a personal note, his death is very sad.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.084
But on a professional
level, it's untenable.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.321
I've been reviewing his files.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.880
He was pursuing a number
of extremely dubious positions.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.642
Are you aware that we own
a $30 million ostrich farm in Morocco,

10:53.720 --> 10:56.644
or that we are the majority stakeholders

10:56.920 --> 10:59.400
in three companies that
specialize in invisibility?

10:59.560 --> 11:04.282
This box is filled with napkins covered
with notes detailing Peter's conviction

11:04.400 --> 11:08.291
that genetically-modified cranberry fungus
would become the next cotton.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.448
- That... That one I remember.
- Yes.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.971
- Monica.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.570
Peter Gregory is dead.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.530
- Yes.
- We need to seem competitive,

11:18.600 --> 11:20.011
now more than ever,

11:20.080 --> 11:23.289
to our investors as well
as to the industry at large.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.361
Well, I mean,

11:24.440 --> 11:28.411
Pied Piper is probably the hottest
early investment in town right now,

11:28.480 --> 11:29.720
and we have them.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.450
Do we?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.568
But why then are they speaking to other
firms about investing in their Series A?

11:35.640 --> 11:38.450
No, no. I just told them to
sit tight for a day or two

11:38.520 --> 11:39.760
until we sorted things out.

11:39.840 --> 11:44.050
It seems that that advanced
a sense of uncertainty,

11:44.120 --> 11:46.327
and now we're at risk
of losing their round.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.846
This could jeopardize the firm

11:48.920 --> 11:51.890
and, by extension, your
career here, Monica,

11:51.960 --> 11:53.450
as an associate partner.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.205
Well, I guess I was just kind of in shock.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.361
Monica...

12:00.520 --> 12:02.329
Peter Gregory is dead.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.201
Yes. I know.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.200
This is great.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.726
I mean, do you know how many times
I've gone into these rooms

12:12.800 --> 12:15.770
with nothing but a half
of an ass in my hand?

12:15.880 --> 12:20.647
We're walking in there with 3-foot cocks
covered in Elvis dust.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.491
- Really?
- Richard Hendricks? They're ready for you.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.971
- This is a fucking layup, guys.
- Okay, let's do this.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.130
Not you, Jared.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.763
Now, with proper funding,

12:33.840 --> 12:38.607
we should be able to put together
a functioning beta in time for CES

12:38.680 --> 12:43.049
and compress Nucleus out
of the marketplace.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.810
Yeah.

12:47.880 --> 12:48.927
I don't know.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.450
You don't... What?

12:52.080 --> 12:54.048
It just doesn't seem worked out to me.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.363
Well, I mean, it was worked out enough
to win TechCrunch Disrupt.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.284
Yes, and congratulations, you won 50 grand,

13:02.360 --> 13:05.807
but you're asking us for 200 times that.

13:05.880 --> 13:10.681
Richard, look, we all know
about your amazing compression rate,

13:10.760 --> 13:12.888
but let's not be naive here.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.043
You can't expect to just
throw money at an algorithm

13:16.120 --> 13:19.966
and beat one of the largest
tech companies in the world.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.690
So why don't you rework this a little

13:21.760 --> 13:24.491
and come back in with a little more?

13:24.560 --> 13:26.210
Maybe next week?

13:28.160 --> 13:29.207
And?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.682
That was really weird.

13:31.760 --> 13:34.730
I guess we don't have
as much Elvis dust on us as I thought.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.485
You see? This is why I wanted
to go with Peter Gregory.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.607
This is bullshit.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.321
I mean, that guy throws this huge party for us
and then acts like he doesn't even want us?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.925
I mean, I fucking hate parties.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.889
And then he says, "Come back next week
when you have more."

13:45.960 --> 13:48.691
More? More than 5.2 on Weissman?

13:48.760 --> 13:50.444
No. No.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.729
Fuck that guy. Fuck this place.
Fuck this whole place.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.322
- Watch me fuck this place.
- No, wait! Wait, wait!

13:57.960 --> 14:01.362
Hey. You remember when you told me
to come back when I had more?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.010
And then I said I would?

14:03.080 --> 14:06.687
Well, I'm not going to. Ever.
This doesn't count. Okay.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.366
I'm covered in dust. I'm a 3-foot dick,

14:09.440 --> 14:11.966
and I've got half an ass
to go to some other company

14:12.080 --> 14:15.050
who's never gonna put me on a Jumbotron
or throw balls at me.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.760
Bye.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.885
Are you feeling unwell?
Do you need protein?

14:29.960 --> 14:31.325
I don't know what happened.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.688
Between Peter dying
and Raviga maybe being gone, I just...

14:34.760 --> 14:36.762
I just wanna get funded
and build Pied Piper.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.205
I hate this part.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.883
Well, if one thing is for sure...

14:40.960 --> 14:44.203
...if we're gonna get any traction,
I need to step up my game.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.004
It's an email from Ron LaFlamme.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.721
"Just got a term sheet from Stern Taylor.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.964
"They offered $5 million
at $25 million post-money valuation.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.320
"More than I thought."

14:55.400 --> 14:56.890
Shit. They were negging us.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.968
- Negging?
- Negging is going negative.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.442
It's a manipulative sex strategy
used by lonely chauvinists.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.726
See, everybody wants us.

15:03.840 --> 15:08.084
But, by shitting all over us,
they try and bring our price down.

15:08.160 --> 15:12.085
But you shitting all over them
counteracted their shitting all over us.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.403
You negged a neg.
Richard, this could be good.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.847
- Where do we have next?
- Ross Loma Capital.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.410
Should I keep doing it?
Should I keep negging?

15:19.520 --> 15:20.965
No, no, I'll handle this.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.691
If they want to negotiate
using hostility and rudeness,

15:24.960 --> 15:26.689
well, they picked the wrong guy.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.330
Well, you see, our main concern

15:30.400 --> 15:33.688
is how you're going to achieve
escape velocity on your growth rate.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.364
If critical mass...

15:36.840 --> 15:39.002
I'm sorry. What's funny?

15:39.080 --> 15:41.242
It's just that painting behind you.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.049
It's awful.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.761
It looks like harlequin Kama-sutra
done poorly.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.801
So, I agree,

15:49.880 --> 15:51.723
bad culture fit.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.643
I think we all just move on.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.131
Look, I didn't say anything
about a culture fit.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.725
No, I did.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.971
Okay. Well,

16:00.040 --> 16:01.326
thank you for meeting with us.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.289
We have a bunch of these things to go to,

16:03.360 --> 16:06.091
hopefully with more tasteful artwork.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.642
And your logo looks like a sideways vagina.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.291
I find that to be racist, don't you?

16:15.800 --> 16:16.961
Okay, here's my concern...

16:17.080 --> 16:20.801
Here's my concern.
Who the hell picked out that shirt for you?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.041
What?

16:23.080 --> 16:25.321
Oh, I see. With the pants.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.085
So I guess it's a whole thing.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.730
My wife picked these out.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.171
Then you married poorly.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.330
Do you care about Pied Piper?

16:34.400 --> 16:37.290
Do I care about Pied Piper?
Well, of course.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.681
Cause if you do, I'm not seeing it.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.647
In fact, what I think I'm seeing
is the human equivalent of a flaccid penis.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.411
"Flak-Sid." It's actually
pronounced "flak-Sid."

16:48.480 --> 16:49.891
Not a lot of people know that.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.769
Well, we are definitely interested,

16:51.840 --> 16:54.366
but I think we need to...

16:54.440 --> 16:56.568
I'm sorry. ls something wrong?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.531
No, this is all wrong.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.887
I am sensing a general lack of vision.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.690
Your muffins smell like shit.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.444
So do your ideas.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.050
One of you is the least attractive person
I've ever seen,

17:10.119 --> 17:12.009
and I'm not gonna say who.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.881
Should we leave or should you?

17:15.960 --> 17:19.328
We just got offered eight at 40.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.970
We're five for five, gentlemen.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.646
And Galveston Capital Fund
and Yountville Ventures called.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.882
They want to move their meetings up
before everyone else.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.725
Hey, let me try.
I want to be rude at this next one.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.040
Go for it.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.406
So, with some proper funding,

17:31.480 --> 17:34.165
we should be able to get
a functioning beta in time for CES.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.527
And if you don't fund us,

17:37.600 --> 17:39.728
you're a fucking slut.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.160
Oh...

17:44.240 --> 17:46.766
What's that smell? Is that a fart?

17:47.760 --> 17:49.000
Are you a farter?

17:50.000 --> 17:54.050
Now, can I have a pastry?
Or are you guys gonna eat 'em all?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.323
'Cause you're gonna get fat.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.970
It's not your fault, Richard. This is
just something that can't be taught,

18:04.040 --> 18:07.567
so leave the next one to me.
I can feel a big one coming on.

18:07.640 --> 18:08.641
What are you gonna do?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.362
I'm not sure yet, but give me room.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.966
There's something inside of me
that has to come out,

18:14.040 --> 18:15.565
and who am I to stop it?

18:18.000 --> 18:19.161
His balls?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.404
He put his balls on the table?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.608
- Right on the table.
- On purpose?

18:23.680 --> 18:26.206
I don't see how it could be by accident.

18:26.280 --> 18:29.443
Richard, I just got an email
from the guys at Midland-Oak.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.887
Apparently, there is a
line, and I crossed it...

18:32.880 --> 18:36.805
The line between $12 and $15 million!

18:37.040 --> 18:38.246
Ba-bam!

18:38.320 --> 18:39.970
Midland-Oak's offer just came in.

18:40.040 --> 18:44.443
Gentlemen, we are valued at 75 million,
fully diluted.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.721
Are you shitting me?

18:45.800 --> 18:47.404
Take a look at these term sheets.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.602
There is a linear correlation

18:49.680 --> 18:51.330
between how intolerable I was...

18:51.440 --> 18:53.044
...and the height of valuation.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.041
Hey, YOU guys. Um...

18:56.120 --> 18:59.124
This is Laurie Bream,
the new managing partner at Raviga.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.483
Oh, uh... Hi. I'm Richard Hendricks.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.404
Yes. I recognize you from your photograph.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.529
- It's very nice to meet you in person.
- Yeah.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.681
Okay, so we did that.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.047
Gentlemen, I am aware
of the degree of interest

19:12.120 --> 19:13.246
you are receiving from other firms.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.450
I am aware that participation in your Series
A will require a very competitive offer,

19:17.520 --> 19:20.444
but for numerous reasons,
I believe it to be the prudent decision.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.130
Now I am presenting you with this.

19:25.760 --> 19:29.810
$20 million at $100 million valuation?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.689
I don't... Uh...

19:31.760 --> 19:34.366
This is way more than any other offer.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.521
Correct.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.000
That is very much intentional.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.210
So, I believe that satisfies
your requirements?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.681
Monica will arrange a time
to formalize the details.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.330
Thank you. Have a good day.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.400
Uh, thank you.

19:48.920 --> 19:49.921
Yes.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.765
Congratulations, guys. I am so glad...

19:56.960 --> 19:59.645
Oh, shit! She's my ride home.
I'll call you, Richard.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.205
Uh, yeah, okay.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.326
- Thanks for stopping...
- Wait! Laurie, hold on!

20:06.120 --> 20:08.122
Guys, I think we're funded.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.567
- Yes! Richie!
- Yeah!

20:14.680 --> 20:17.650
So, I push my dick to the side,
unbutton the bottom two buttons and...

20:17.720 --> 20:18.721
Barn!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.446
Ah!

20:21.520 --> 20:23.249
- What are you doing?
- Shit. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.842
Meet me on the side of the house.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.888
- I... Okay.
- Okay. Okay. Go.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.243
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

20:32.320 --> 20:35.722
If anyone finds out that I came back here,
I will get fired, okay?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.484
Okay.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.404
- Don't take this deal.
- What?

20:40.480 --> 20:43.051
You are worth half that at best.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.568
Oh, wow. Thanks for the compliment.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.126
No. The credit to you guys.
You negotiated your asses off,

20:48.200 --> 20:50.567
but this is a classic runaway valuation.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.050
What's wrong with that?

20:53.120 --> 20:58.206
Pied Piper will be tied to this crazy valuation
that you will never be able to live up to.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.128
If you don't keep increasing
in value in the next round,

21:02.200 --> 21:04.521
if you have a down round, you are fucked.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.604
It is the kiss of death for a young CEO.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.366
You want to start with a realistic
valuation and grow at a reasonable pace.

21:11.440 --> 21:15.968
Okay, well, if it's such a shitty deal,
then why did your boss offer it to us?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.088
Because she's competitive as hell.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.970
She needs Pied Piper
to keep Raviga afloat, Richard.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.690
- Okay.
- Look, I respect Laurie,

21:23.120 --> 21:25.805
but this is the exact type of thing
Peter never did.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.128
Richard, come on. I own
shares in Pied Piper.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.282
If this high evaluation
was good in the long-term,

21:31.360 --> 21:33.249
would I be standing here, risking my job?

21:34.480 --> 21:35.561
Don't take our offer.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.007
Maybe go with the lowest offer you got.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.809
Even that might be too high.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.804
Again,
thank you for the compliment.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.924
Also, I didn't see anything in there.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.002
No. Yeah, thank you.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.407
I was gonna say if you had,
you'd have to show me yours, too.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.764
Um...

21:56.840 --> 21:59.923
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks for the...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.001
Okay.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.371
Yeah, sorry about that party.

22:18.240 --> 22:19.969
I was in kind of a bad way that night.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.442
And truth is, I'm actually doing okay.

22:23.880 --> 22:26.167
- Good. That's great.
- Yeah.

22:26.280 --> 22:29.170
I mean, I could run the scenarios
about what happened all I want,

22:29.600 --> 22:33.491
but I finally just realized
there's just nothing I can do, you know?

22:33.560 --> 22:34.846
Yeah.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.685
So, I'm at peace with it all.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.081
I was thinking, actually, um,

22:40.160 --> 22:42.766
what if you had asked for less?

22:44.240 --> 22:45.287
What?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.448
Well, what if you could've gone to someone

22:47.520 --> 22:50.126
and asked for less than
what they offered that first round?

22:50.440 --> 22:52.602
Like, you mean, negotiating them down?

22:53.240 --> 22:55.049
- Yeah.
- Can you even do that?

22:55.120 --> 22:58.090
- Well, yeah. I mean, why not?
- Yeah, but...

22:59.800 --> 23:03.202
I mean, I guess, technically, I could have.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.327
Mmm...

23:04.440 --> 23:05.646
Huh.

23:05.720 --> 23:09.486
Yeah, I suppose you could argue
that it might've been easier

23:09.560 --> 23:13.281
to hit more realistic benchmarks

23:13.640 --> 23:14.846
and reach cash flow break-even.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.285
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.763
And then,
we wouldn't have faced that down round.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.005
And...

23:26.640 --> 23:28.847
We wouldn't have
had to settle for acquisition.

23:30.480 --> 23:31.766
All that money

23:32.720 --> 23:33.767
fucked me.

23:33.840 --> 23:35.888
Wow. I mean, I don't know about...

23:35.960 --> 23:37.610
- Shit!
- Maybe.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.730
- Look... Hey...
- No, no, no. We could've done a legit Series B.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.450
Right? I'd still be CEO.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.000
I'd have my job,

23:46.080 --> 23:47.445
my kick-ass house.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.648
I'd probably still have my girlfriend...

23:52.040 --> 23:54.566
- Fuck!
- Okay.

23:54.640 --> 23:57.689
Why the fuck didn't anyone tell me
I could take less?

23:57.840 --> 23:59.842
I don't know. I don't know.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.126
Ideas come up and then...

24:02.200 --> 24:03.611
Fuck!

24:03.680 --> 24:06.206
I'll take a cab, so I'll leave you to it.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.520
Thanks for meeting me here.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.161
Fuck!

24:16.520 --> 24:17.806
Richard.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.724
Richard, I'm Laurie Bream.
I was inside your home yesterday.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.723
Have you made a decision
regarding our proposal?

24:23.800 --> 24:29.045
Yeah, yeah, we'll go with you guys,
but we need to renegotiate the terms.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.169
I'm afraid that's untenable.
We're offering as much money as we can.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.443
Uh, no, no, we wanna go lower.
We want less... A lot less, actually.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.367
We'll go with Raviga

24:37.440 --> 24:41.286
if you guys do $10 million
at a $50 million valuation,

24:41.360 --> 24:42.771
not 20 at 100.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.845
I think this is more reasonable,

24:44.960 --> 24:48.681
and it's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.000
I was not anticipating this,

24:50.080 --> 24:52.924
but I think it will be
workable from our end.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.843
And one more thing,
Monica votes for Raviga's board seat.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.521
Certainly that seems unimportant.

25:02.160 --> 25:05.448
I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow, and
we can speak about the relevant details.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.726
Good.

25:15.280 --> 25:19.046
Peter was one of the few
who genuinely took action

25:19.160 --> 25:22.209
to use technology to help humanity thrive.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.203
But how exactly can we quantify

25:24.280 --> 25:26.760
another human's contributions to mankind?

25:28.280 --> 25:30.726
Let's break it down into
its three component elements.

25:36.040 --> 25:40.762
I met Peter when he was thinking about
investing in my company, Zettasphere,

25:40.840 --> 25:42.444
although I think he was hesitant

25:42.560 --> 25:45.530
after his disappointing
initial return from Snapchat.

25:45.600 --> 25:50.003
He came on board, anyway,
and every month we would meet.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.969
Peter was always an honest man,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.726
and I know that
if Peter were here with us today,

25:54.800 --> 25:57.121
he would say that
he was not disappointed in Snapchat.

25:57.640 --> 26:01.201
And he would forgive you, Lev,
for your misunderstanding.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.521
That's just the kind of guy that Peter was,

26:03.600 --> 26:06.080
warm, generous,

26:06.160 --> 26:09.050
and not disappointed in Snapchat.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.162
I'll never forget the
first time I met Peter.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.483
It was in his mom's garage, where we
started our first business together

26:22.600 --> 26:25.604
manufacturing VGA graphics cards
for IBM clones.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.006
We never looked back.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.809
And you know, the last time I saw him,

26:29.880 --> 26:33.168
it was at a restaurant,
not a half-mile away from that same garage.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.810
We talked, as old friends do,

26:34.880 --> 26:37.531
he asked me about Jackson Hole,

26:37.600 --> 26:40.683
I asked him about Pilates.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.851
And yet, something was wrong.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.845
Underneath it all,
there was an unmistakable tension.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.522
A tension I will forever regret.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.486
It's no secret Peter and
I had our differences.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.282
We let business get between us.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.089
NOW?

26:59.160 --> 27:01.447
Now I wish I could say I'm sorry for that.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.727
Now it's too late. He's gone.

27:04.480 --> 27:08.087
And it makes me realize
the importance of forgiveness,

27:08.160 --> 27:11.687
of doing things with love
and compassion in your heart,

27:11.760 --> 27:13.888
and not vengeance and competition.

27:15.160 --> 27:18.323
I mean, we owe that to
each other, don't we?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.447
And to him?

27:20.280 --> 27:23.489
After all, this valley is the place
Peter himself helped build.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.844
Where we come together as dreamers,

27:26.920 --> 27:28.251
all of us,

27:28.320 --> 27:31.051
to truly make the world a better place.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.330
This is Florence during the Renaissance.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.004
This is Camelot.

27:37.520 --> 27:41.730
This is the place Peter himself called
"the cradle of innovation."

27:45.760 --> 27:47.410
I will miss my friend.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.850
Bye, Pete.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.968
Maybe he is a human, after all.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.285
I'm sorry.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.165
It's from Ron LaFlamme.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.324
"Gavin Belson is suing you.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.767
"Filed claims today that
you stole Pied Piper from Hooli."

28:10.560 --> 28:11.800
Shit.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.248
Gavin Belson is suing us.
