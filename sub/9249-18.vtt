WEBVTT

00:05.621 --> 00:07.965
It's kind of weird to think
that everything we do now

00:07.967 --> 00:10.968
is being recorded.

00:10.970 --> 00:14.738
- Eh, it's probably best for everybody.
- Mm-hmm.

00:14.740 --> 00:18.375
I am on the mayor's side on this one.

00:18.377 --> 00:20.678
(Quietly): Keep that thing off of me.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.846
(Phone ringing)

00:25.116 --> 00:27.351
Hey, ma.

00:27.353 --> 00:29.553
Okay, okay.

00:29.555 --> 00:31.889
Calm-calm down, okay?

00:31.891 --> 00:34.224
Nobody is lurking in your bushes.

00:34.226 --> 00:36.860
Mm, there are some sick people out there.

00:36.862 --> 00:40.030
Dopers, junkies, hustlers.
I'm Officer McMillan, and...

00:40.032 --> 00:42.633
This is my city.

00:42.635 --> 00:44.134
Okay, look, we'll be right over.

00:44.136 --> 00:47.137
Just put on some clothes and
stay away from the windows.

00:47.139 --> 00:48.739
Well, h-how is being naked...

00:48.741 --> 00:52.542
How-how is being naked
good for your eczema?

00:52.544 --> 00:55.545
Just put a damn robe on!

00:56.781 --> 00:58.248
(Crickets chirping)

00:58.250 --> 01:00.584
You know, if we edit that
dash cam footage down,

01:00.586 --> 01:02.052
get our demo reel into the right hands,

01:02.054 --> 01:03.520
we could have our own TV show.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.956
How about we play that
game where you don't talk?

01:05.958 --> 01:08.692
Got you. Save my voice for on-air.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.160
Wait a second.

01:10.162 --> 01:12.195
I think somebody is by the window.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.797
All right, sicko. Chicago P.D.

01:13.799 --> 01:16.132
Let me see those hands and
come out from that hedge.

01:16.134 --> 01:18.268
Woman (Slurring): Why
don't you come on in here

01:18.270 --> 01:23.473
- and get me, big boy?
- Kay?

01:23.475 --> 01:26.476
(Laughs)

01:26.478 --> 01:30.080
Mikey meatball!

01:30.082 --> 01:32.182
What are you doing? Just mace the pervert

01:32.184 --> 01:34.384
and get him out of here
so I can go to bed!

01:34.386 --> 01:35.385
It's not a pervert, ma.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.553
It's Kay.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.021
Kay!

01:38.023 --> 01:40.456
What the hell are you doing out here?!

01:40.458 --> 01:42.831
You didn't tell me you
were coming to visit.

01:42.832 --> 01:46.696
I'm not coming to visit. I'm moving in.

01:46.698 --> 01:50.366
Fantastic. The neighbors
already think I'm a lesbian.

01:51.869 --> 01:52.969
Hmm.

01:52.971 --> 01:55.738
Hey. Couple of old
lesbians living together,

01:55.740 --> 01:57.707
that's your TV show.

01:57.709 --> 02:00.276
Shut up and help me find the bags.

I think you got this handled.

02:32.463 --> 02:33.729
Oh, yeah. If there's one thing

02:33.731 --> 02:36.098
my mom taught me, it's
how to sober people up.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.368
And what to tell social
services if they call.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.372
All right, I am ready to go.

02:43.374 --> 02:46.875
- Are you wearing makeup?
- Just used a little instant cocoa

02:46.877 --> 02:49.445
to bring down the shine on my forehead.

02:49.447 --> 02:51.083
You're ridiculous.

02:51.084 --> 02:54.884
See, you say ridiculous,
I say camera ready.

02:55.886 --> 02:57.385
bye.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.266
Isn't this great?

02:59.267 --> 03:00.689
Kay coming to visit us.

03:00.691 --> 03:01.957
She came to see me.

03:01.959 --> 03:04.927
She puked in <i> my</i> hedge.

03:04.929 --> 03:07.696
Let's not fight over her

03:07.698 --> 03:10.232
because you will lose.

03:10.234 --> 03:14.836
- Peggy: Hey!
- Hey. There she is. Whew,

03:14.838 --> 03:16.638
that was some bender.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.640
The last thing I remember

03:18.642 --> 03:21.777
was chugging a double Mai
Tai in the Rangoon airport.

03:21.779 --> 03:22.778
Peggy: Oh.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.179
You probably got slipped a Mickey.

03:24.181 --> 03:26.548
You're lucky you didn't
get taken as a sex slave.

03:26.550 --> 03:28.817
That's why I don't travel.

03:28.819 --> 03:31.920
You don't travel because
you hate foreigners.

03:31.922 --> 03:34.256
I can have two reasons.

03:34.258 --> 03:37.959
So, Rangoon... What is that like?

03:37.961 --> 03:42.631
I'm picturing, you know, opium
dens and pickpocketing monkeys.

03:42.633 --> 03:45.400
No, I never left the airport;
I just caught the first plane

03:45.402 --> 03:47.369
out of Afghanistan.

03:47.371 --> 03:49.471
(Gasps) Oh, my god, Afghanistan. Oh.

03:49.473 --> 03:50.572
Oh, no.

03:50.574 --> 03:51.740
It's no picnic.

03:51.742 --> 03:53.842
Anyway, I'm done with all that.

03:53.844 --> 03:57.245
- Done with what?
- Work, travel, everything.

03:57.247 --> 03:58.713
I told Nat Geo

03:58.715 --> 04:00.281
I've photographed my last lost tribe.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.083
Let somebody else squat in a cave

04:02.085 --> 04:05.386
and scrub their keister
with a handful of hot sand.

04:05.388 --> 04:07.555
(Chuckles) Listen, I get it.

04:07.557 --> 04:09.824
You know, I go up to
the Indiana state fair,

04:09.826 --> 04:12.794
and every year I say, never again.

04:12.796 --> 04:15.129
oh. I mean, but you're Kay McKinnon.

04:15.131 --> 04:17.398
I mean, traveling's in your blood.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.168
Yeah, along with half a
dozen tropical diseases.

04:20.170 --> 04:22.537
Exactly. You're riddled
with exotic viruses.

04:22.539 --> 04:24.906
Do you know how cool that is?

04:24.908 --> 04:26.074
Peggy: Leave her alone.

04:26.076 --> 04:27.675
She's lived her life.

04:27.677 --> 04:31.079
Now she's come back so we
can grow old and die together.

04:31.081 --> 04:33.014
Welcome home.

04:33.016 --> 04:35.683
I'm just burned-out, honey.

04:35.685 --> 04:37.752
It's the end of the road for me.

04:37.754 --> 04:40.388
No, this is just a pit stop.
I'm surprised there's not guys

04:40.390 --> 04:42.190
in Pennzoil jumpsuits buzzing around you.

04:42.192 --> 04:43.157
(Buzzing)

04:43.159 --> 04:45.159
Listen, it's enough, okay?

04:45.161 --> 04:47.028
I'm done.

04:47.030 --> 04:48.829
So let's just... Let's just drop it.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.498
Okay. Sorry, Kay.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.633
I like this new you.

04:52.635 --> 04:55.369
And don't worry, when we
can't take care of ourselves,

04:55.371 --> 04:57.138
we'll hire a Jamaican woman.

04:57.140 --> 05:00.308
She'll feed us, bathe us, and when
we go really <i> cuckoo's nest,</i>

05:00.310 --> 05:02.777
she'll smother us with a pillow.

05:02.779 --> 05:07.148
I prefer pills, but it's your house.

05:07.150 --> 05:09.817
This is gonna be a hoot.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.889
So Kay just gave you all her equipment?

05:14.891 --> 05:16.891
I think she's just going
through a little something,

05:16.893 --> 05:18.525
so I'm just gonna hold on to these

05:18.527 --> 05:20.427
until she comes to her senses.

05:20.429 --> 05:22.930
You also gonna give back the
two million frequent flyer miles

05:22.932 --> 05:27.167
- she gave you?
- She really wanted me to have those.

05:27.169 --> 05:28.535
It's a bad sign when people start giving

05:28.537 --> 05:29.503
their possessions away.

05:29.505 --> 05:31.505
Had an uncle gave me his ham radio.

05:31.507 --> 05:33.374
Next day, he was gone.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.275
- Suicide?
- Prison.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.178
He had taken the guts out of that radio

05:38.180 --> 05:39.813
and filled it with a stolen Renoir.

05:39.815 --> 05:42.483
Course, I didn't find that
out until he got paroled

05:42.485 --> 05:44.251
and I told him I sold the radio.

05:44.253 --> 05:46.520
Then he offed himself.

05:46.522 --> 05:49.723
Just saying, check those
lenses before you pawn them.

05:52.093 --> 05:54.428
So your big hero's slowing down, huh?

05:54.430 --> 05:57.731
Guess your boozy mother isn't
looking so bad now, is she?

05:57.733 --> 06:00.133
- What's that mean?
- Mom's just a little jealous.

06:00.135 --> 06:03.470
She thinks you respect Kay more than her.

06:03.472 --> 06:05.672
Well... yeah.

06:05.674 --> 06:06.907
But I mean... I mean that...

06:06.909 --> 06:09.643
I don't know how I mean that. I just...

06:09.645 --> 06:11.845
I just don't understand
how somebody so vibrant

06:11.847 --> 06:14.781
and full of life can just give it all up.

06:14.783 --> 06:16.450
Well, you said Kay's
traveled around the world.

06:16.452 --> 06:18.251
You know, crossing all those time zones,

06:18.253 --> 06:21.087
who knows how old she is by now?

06:21.089 --> 06:25.158
Oh, I'd love to see how
the wiring is up there.

06:29.030 --> 06:31.765
Hey, make sure you wear
your shoe inserts tomorrow

06:31.767 --> 06:34.801
'cause I signed us up for
crowd control at a rally.

06:34.803 --> 06:36.369
Aw, you know I hate working those things.

06:36.371 --> 06:38.004
It's hot, people are
screaming in your face.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.672
I get it, you're here, you're queer.

06:39.674 --> 06:41.141
I'm fine with it.

06:41.143 --> 06:44.310
Yeah. But this one is actually
women demonstrating their rights

06:44.312 --> 06:46.880
to bare their breasts and
feed their babies in public.

06:46.882 --> 06:49.349
I'm fine with that, too.

06:49.351 --> 06:53.853
- So, how's your mom's friend doing?
- Uh, she's pretty depressed.

06:53.855 --> 06:55.421
Ooh, and she's staying at your mother's?

06:55.423 --> 06:58.324
That's like trying to kick drugs
and moving into a crack house.

06:58.326 --> 07:01.627
it's weird. It's like Kay's
suddenly given in to old age.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.097
I always thought she'd live
a long and adventurous life

07:04.099 --> 07:06.699
until the day she got t-boned by a rhino.

07:06.701 --> 07:08.501
Oh, no, rhinos are sweethearts.

07:08.503 --> 07:10.870
It's the hippos that will get you.

07:10.872 --> 07:13.072
Oh, don't let that little
bird on their back fool you.

07:13.074 --> 07:15.274
They are real jerks.

07:15.276 --> 07:16.409
Yeah, well I for one refuse

07:16.411 --> 07:17.910
to go gently into that good night.

07:17.912 --> 07:19.579
Yeah, I'm going out like Jack Lalanne.

07:19.581 --> 07:22.615
90 years old and still pulling
train cars with my teeth.

07:22.617 --> 07:25.284
To be honest, I can't
wait to get old, you know?

07:25.286 --> 07:27.153
Sitting around all day,
people bringing you food.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.988
You get to sleep whenever you want.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.456
You do that now.

07:34.127 --> 07:36.295
(Doorbell rings)

07:39.199 --> 07:43.436
- What do you want?
- I'm here to see Kay.

07:43.438 --> 07:45.004
Now's not a good time.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.374
We're in the middle of a
very intense Jigsaw puzzle.

07:48.376 --> 07:51.544
So I can't come in? M-maybe I can help.

07:51.546 --> 07:52.745
I don't think so.

07:52.747 --> 07:54.613
She's on the borders, I'm on the inside.

07:54.615 --> 07:57.283
Three on a puzzle's asking for trouble.

07:57.285 --> 07:58.517
All right,

07:58.519 --> 07:59.685
thanks for stopping by.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.887
No, no! This is ridiculous. Come on.

08:01.889 --> 08:04.056
I want to take Kay out.
You know, give her a...

08:04.058 --> 08:06.425
A day out on the town, cheer her up.

08:06.427 --> 08:07.693
She doesn't want that.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.595
Maybe we should let Kay decide.

08:09.597 --> 08:12.197
Boy, are you a sore loser.

08:12.199 --> 08:14.500
She's mine now.

08:14.502 --> 08:15.968
We're going to bingo,

08:15.970 --> 08:18.370
catching the early bird at souplantation,

08:18.372 --> 08:20.339
then back home to see what new suit

08:20.341 --> 08:22.774
Steve Harvey's wearing on the <i> feud.</i>

08:22.776 --> 08:24.510
All right.

08:24.512 --> 08:27.212
Well, I'll leave you to it.

08:27.214 --> 08:28.380
Kay, it's Molly! Hey!

08:28.382 --> 08:31.617
Stay alive! I will find you!

08:32.418 --> 08:34.620
(Mutters)

08:38.291 --> 08:42.527
B-14! B-14!

08:42.529 --> 08:44.129
I-19!

08:44.131 --> 08:46.665
(Loudly): Peggy says
you used to take pictures

08:46.667 --> 08:50.268
- for magazines!
- I'm not deaf, honey.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.804
I am!

08:52.806 --> 08:54.806
I got the sister to bless our cards.

08:54.808 --> 08:57.943
We got baby Jesus on our side.

08:57.945 --> 08:59.744
Oh, this is where he's been hiding out

08:59.746 --> 09:03.114
while the rest of the
world is going to hell.

09:03.116 --> 09:05.417
To the owner of the older
mustard yellow impala,

09:05.419 --> 09:07.952
your headlights are on.

09:07.954 --> 09:10.221
Huh. That's me.

09:10.223 --> 09:11.956
I don't remember turning those on.

09:11.958 --> 09:14.292
Look at us, losing it together.

09:14.294 --> 09:17.162
I guess we're closer to
that Jamaican pillow kiss

09:17.164 --> 09:18.530
- than we thought.
- (Laughs)

09:18.532 --> 09:23.101
Man: G-46. G-46.

09:23.103 --> 09:25.770
(Quietly): Hey.

09:25.772 --> 09:27.972
- Where the hell did you come from?
- The land of the living.

09:27.974 --> 09:29.507
Let's get out of here.

09:29.509 --> 09:32.210
Molly, I say this out of love:

09:32.212 --> 09:34.512
Leave me the hell alone.

09:34.514 --> 09:37.081
Aw. And I say this out of love:

09:37.083 --> 09:39.684
- Get up! Get up! Get up!
- Oh, go away. Go away!

09:39.686 --> 09:41.052
Go away. I'm not gonna stop.

09:41.054 --> 09:44.556
- Go away!
- Ah! I knew you still had it in you.

09:44.557 --> 09:46.057
Let's go!

09:46.925 --> 09:48.493
You!

09:49.595 --> 09:51.863
Free bingo cards! And they're all winners!

09:51.865 --> 09:53.831
Get in!

09:53.833 --> 09:55.566
Oh! Molly...

09:55.568 --> 09:58.202
You can't have her yet, Peggy Biggs!

10:08.000 --> 10:09.768
Crowd (Chanting): It's just
a breast! Give it a rest!

10:09.770 --> 10:12.036
It's just a breast! Give it a rest!

10:12.038 --> 10:14.439
- (Chanting continues)
- Uh, I got to admit,

10:14.441 --> 10:16.674
I thought this would be more titillating.

10:16.676 --> 10:18.076
No pun intended.

10:18.078 --> 10:19.477
That's the third time you said it.

10:19.479 --> 10:21.679
- I think the pun was intended.
- Okay, okay.

10:21.681 --> 10:24.382
Just trying to keep you
abreast of the situation.

10:24.384 --> 10:25.850
All right, get them all out.

10:25.852 --> 10:28.553
I'm done. I just thought that
this crowd would be larger.

10:28.555 --> 10:30.788
Turns out it's just an
itty-bitty committee.

10:30.790 --> 10:32.090
(Phone ringing)

10:32.092 --> 10:33.891
(Chanting continues)

10:33.893 --> 10:35.560
Yeah, mom?

10:35.562 --> 10:37.362
She did what?

10:37.364 --> 10:40.398
Well, now, hold on,
kidnapping is a strong word.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.600
What did Molly do exactly?

10:43.635 --> 10:46.637
Okay, well, yeah, technically
that is kidnapping.

10:46.639 --> 10:48.306
Crowd (Chanting): To give nutrition!

10:48.308 --> 10:50.942
It's our mission to give nutrition!

10:50.944 --> 10:53.611
(Chanting continues)

10:53.613 --> 10:56.113
Ma, I got to go.

10:56.115 --> 10:58.282
Uh, th-things are starting
to get ugly down here.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.351
No, no, no, I didn't mean you ladies.

11:00.353 --> 11:01.919
You're beautiful.

11:03.021 --> 11:04.822
Things are certainly perking up.

11:04.824 --> 11:05.923
Shut up.

11:05.925 --> 11:08.926
(Chanting continues)

11:08.928 --> 11:11.495
(Horns honking)

11:11.497 --> 11:13.764
Molly: Okay, this wasn't exactly

11:13.766 --> 11:17.568
the getaway I was planning.

11:17.570 --> 11:20.538
But I did take Peggy's distributor cap,

11:20.540 --> 11:24.108
so that slowed her down for a bit.

11:24.110 --> 11:26.710
That's the cap to her wiper fluid.

11:26.712 --> 11:28.979
Oh. Well, I don't know cars.

11:28.981 --> 11:32.383
But... I'm sure she's caught
in the same traffic we are.

11:32.385 --> 11:35.085
Oh, please, just take me back to Peggy's.

11:35.087 --> 11:37.454
Why? So you can finish your Jigsaw puzzle?

11:37.456 --> 11:40.190
Spoiler alert... It's a lighthouse.

11:40.192 --> 11:43.794
- Why can't you just let me be?
- Because this isn't you.

11:43.796 --> 11:46.563
Okay, you're one of the
best female photojournalists

11:46.565 --> 11:47.798
of our time.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.033
You have gone where nobody else would go,

11:50.035 --> 11:51.835
and your photos made a difference.

11:51.837 --> 11:54.638
- I didn't make a damn bit of difference.
- Yes, you did.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.907
- And you did it with this camera.
- Aw, come on,

11:56.909 --> 11:58.141
what are you doing with that?

11:58.143 --> 11:59.843
- I'm giving it back to you.
- (Groans)

11:59.845 --> 12:02.646
Because I do not think
that your work is finished.

12:02.648 --> 12:04.781
Okay, you want to see my work?

12:04.783 --> 12:05.816
Yeah,

12:05.818 --> 12:07.484
I'm gonna show you something.

12:07.486 --> 12:10.454
- You see that little girl?
- Yeah.

12:10.456 --> 12:12.656
Well, I took her picture
in a little village

12:12.658 --> 12:15.058
- outside of Jalalabad.
- She's beautiful.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.727
She was very excited... It
was her first day at school.

12:17.729 --> 12:20.030
She kept showing me her new notebook.

12:20.032 --> 12:23.533
And the next day the Taliban came in.

12:25.303 --> 12:28.471
The things I've seen.

12:28.473 --> 12:30.440
I can't do it anymore.

12:30.442 --> 12:32.108
'Cause no matter what,

12:32.110 --> 12:35.478
people just keep doing
horrible things to each other.

12:38.983 --> 12:42.519
I can't even begin to imagine

12:42.521 --> 12:44.354
what you've been through, but I don't think

12:44.356 --> 12:46.189
you should just... give it all up.

12:46.191 --> 12:48.425
I mean, you can put her picture out there.

12:48.427 --> 12:50.260
- Why don't you tell her story?
- Oh,

12:50.262 --> 12:52.228
that's not gonna make any difference.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.964
People are slaughtering each
other out there every day.

12:54.966 --> 12:56.900
The world goes on.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.136
But I can't. I just...

13:00.138 --> 13:02.605
'Cause every time I close my eyes,

13:02.607 --> 13:05.775
I see that little girl.

13:05.777 --> 13:08.044
Man: Help!

13:08.046 --> 13:09.712
Can someone help us?

13:09.714 --> 13:14.417
- Are you gonna come with me?
- I told you... I'm done.

13:15.619 --> 13:17.120
This crowd's getting a little unwieldy.

13:17.122 --> 13:19.355
Captain said the traffic's
backing up to the Eisenhower.

13:19.357 --> 13:20.824
- (Crowd chanting)
- Yeah, after those tops came off,

13:20.826 --> 13:22.525
half this crowd is creepy lookie-loos.

13:22.527 --> 13:24.127
Really, man? Put the phone down.

13:24.129 --> 13:25.662
They're just boobs, people. Move along.

13:25.664 --> 13:28.298
- Nothing to see here.
- Yeah, sad thing is, you're right.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.699
You stare at 'em long enough,

13:29.701 --> 13:32.302
they just turn into pieces
of skin... mystery's gone.

13:32.304 --> 13:36.306
Now I'm wondering what they
look like <i> in</i> a bra.

13:36.308 --> 13:39.175
Come on, it's just up
here. My wife is in labor,

13:39.177 --> 13:41.210
and our doula is somewhere in that rally.

13:41.212 --> 13:43.112
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I thought this was, like,

13:43.114 --> 13:46.249
a hold the lug nuts while you
change the tire sort of situation.

13:46.251 --> 13:48.384
(Woman yelling, crying) Oh.

13:48.386 --> 13:51.687
(Yelling)

13:51.689 --> 13:53.055
Oh, ho-ho.

13:53.057 --> 13:54.624
Wow, you are...

13:54.626 --> 13:56.292
Having a baby.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.594
- I know.
- It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

13:58.596 --> 14:00.897
She was supposed to have it
in our bathtub.

14:00.899 --> 14:03.099
Okay, okay, okay, all right, all right.

14:03.101 --> 14:06.602
Uh, maybe-maybe the
cabbie can help us, huh?

14:06.604 --> 14:09.038
Huh? Hi. You want to
come out here and help us?

14:09.040 --> 14:11.073
Huh? Come on!

14:12.009 --> 14:13.376
Really?

14:13.378 --> 14:16.846
You could at least turn off the meter!

14:16.848 --> 14:20.516
Crowd (Chanting): Hey-ho, let
us show! Hey-ho, let us show!

14:20.518 --> 14:22.752
Hey-ho, let us show!

14:22.754 --> 14:25.221
(Phone rings)

14:25.223 --> 14:27.223
Sweetie, where are you?

14:27.225 --> 14:30.326
What?! Okay, okay, I'm two blocks away.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.194
Don't worry, I'll be right there.

14:32.196 --> 14:34.964
- Is everything okay?
- Aw, Molly's gone from kidnapping

14:34.966 --> 14:38.100
to delivering babies...
All hell's breaking loose.

14:38.102 --> 14:40.402
My husband's on his way and he's a cop,

14:40.404 --> 14:42.204
so he's gonna make it all better.

14:42.206 --> 14:45.074
Until then, I think maybe
we... maybe we just breathe.

14:45.076 --> 14:47.009
Breathe. Yeah, that's good. Just listen

14:47.011 --> 14:49.378
to your body... it's gonna
tell you what you need,

14:49.380 --> 14:51.780
and then when it tells
you, you can tell me and...

14:51.782 --> 14:53.749
(Both women screaming)

14:53.751 --> 14:55.717
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:55.719 --> 14:57.286
Oh, it <i> does</i> feel better.

14:57.288 --> 14:58.987
It really does feel better than breathing.

14:58.989 --> 15:01.657
All right, I'm not sure
if should kind of go in,

15:01.659 --> 15:04.526
or if I should just kind of
hang back and wait and catch.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.094
I don't want you to go in.

15:06.096 --> 15:08.330
I don't want to go in,
either, so that's good...

15:08.332 --> 15:09.798
We're working together, and that's...

15:09.800 --> 15:10.966
(Both women yell)

15:10.968 --> 15:13.735
Okay, I know that feels better,

15:13.737 --> 15:16.672
but it is also starting to freak me out!

15:16.674 --> 15:19.708
- What do we got here?
- There's a baby comin'! Now!

15:19.710 --> 15:21.877
Oh...

15:21.879 --> 15:23.612
You're gonna be just fine.

15:23.614 --> 15:26.381
- What's your name, honey?
- Freedom.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.483
Well, we'll get into that name later.

15:28.485 --> 15:30.352
Let's just get your baby out.

15:30.354 --> 15:32.387
- I'd like that.
- Oh...

15:32.389 --> 15:35.223
I know you're scared, but
I promise you can do this.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.626
I don't know, I don't think I can.

15:37.628 --> 15:39.561
I'm talking to her. What I need from you

15:39.563 --> 15:41.229
is a blanket and a bottle of water.

15:41.231 --> 15:44.499
- I got a sweater and a half bottle of Gatorade in my car.
- Perfect.

15:44.501 --> 15:47.068
And grab my purse. I
got a Vicodin in there.

15:47.070 --> 15:49.871
We can split it three ways.

15:49.873 --> 15:51.106
Don't be nervous.

15:51.108 --> 15:53.508
I've seen women give birth
in much worse conditions.

15:53.510 --> 15:55.810
- (Laughs): Really?
- You bet.

15:55.812 --> 15:57.779
Mud huts, rain forests,

15:57.781 --> 15:59.848
in the middle of a war zone.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.317
Somehow, life always finds a way.

16:02.319 --> 16:04.252
All right, I'm gonna need you

16:04.254 --> 16:06.921
- to push when I tell you.
- Okay, here. Here.

16:06.923 --> 16:08.289
I got it.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.725
Oh... wow, that is a baby's head.

16:10.727 --> 16:13.361
- That's a baby's head.
- You're almost there!

16:13.363 --> 16:15.430
Yeah. Okay, honey.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.065
All right, push.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.100
(Grunting) Ooh. You got it...

16:19.102 --> 16:21.035
Oh, that-a-girl, that-a-girl,

16:21.037 --> 16:23.404
- okay, give me one more push.
- (Yelling)

16:23.406 --> 16:25.640
(Continues yelling) Oh... ah...

16:25.642 --> 16:27.241
Oh, that's it, that's it.

16:27.243 --> 16:29.777
- (Chanting continues)
- Okay. Hey-hey, lot of skin.

16:29.779 --> 16:32.680
Okay, good for you. All right. Right on.

16:32.682 --> 16:34.081
All right.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.583
Let's not have an incident.

16:35.585 --> 16:37.385
Okay. Ooh! Ooh!

16:37.387 --> 16:38.820
Oh, thank god.

16:38.822 --> 16:40.688
I thought that was... (Chuckles)

16:40.690 --> 16:42.690
Hey, sweetie. Heh.

16:43.725 --> 16:46.694

- Molly: Oh, my god.

17:24.406 --> 17:27.662
Mike, I'm-I'm near a tree
and I'm wearing a shirt.

17:27.663 --> 17:29.311
That should really narrow it down.

17:30.382 --> 17:34.089
- Molly!
- Hey! Hey, over here!

17:34.384 --> 17:36.450

17:36.452 --> 17:37.385
Hi.

17:37.387 --> 17:39.881
- Hey, where's the pregnant lady?
- Oh, she's with the baby,

17:39.882 --> 17:40.988
and they're doing fine.

17:40.990 --> 17:42.490
- You delivered it?
- Well,

17:42.492 --> 17:45.459
no, but, you know, I watched,
and I didn't throw up,

17:45.461 --> 17:47.361
so that's something.

17:47.363 --> 17:49.263
- I'm proud of you.
- Aw.

17:49.265 --> 17:51.465
I got some great shots of these women.

17:51.467 --> 17:53.301
I mean, they're so brave... they're just...

17:53.303 --> 17:56.037
They're fighting for something
they really believe in, you know?

17:56.039 --> 17:58.239
They're beautiful. You got to live life

17:58.241 --> 18:00.941
- until it's ripped out of your arms.
- Mike: That's the spirit.

18:00.943 --> 18:04.412
See? You may end up getting
t-boned by that rhino yet.

18:04.414 --> 18:05.913
I don't get it.

18:05.915 --> 18:07.748
Hey, Molly, hold this for me.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.250
Huh? Okay.

18:09.252 --> 18:11.919
You can watch change, or
you can be a part of it.

18:11.921 --> 18:12.920
I'm going in.

18:12.922 --> 18:14.922
Oh, god. Ha-ha!

18:14.924 --> 18:16.157
(Laughs)

18:16.159 --> 18:17.858
- Hold this.
- Oh, no.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.594
Kay, I will follow you anywhere!

18:20.596 --> 18:23.264
We need some sunscreen!

18:24.532 --> 18:26.700
I better hold on to these

18:26.702 --> 18:28.899

18:28.900 --> 18:30.802
