20:30.979 --> 20:32.439
They're all the same person.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.691
She has the same birthmark
on her neck.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.151
- You're right.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.778
ANDI: Of course I am.

20:37.861 --> 20:38.320
- I have to tell
the council.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.866
ANDI: Great.
Let's get the magic tablet.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.289
- Hey, you know what this party
could really use?

20:49.373 --> 20:50.290
Some music!

20:50.374 --> 20:51.833
- I--I've almost got it.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.085
I just need
to find the input.

20:53.168 --> 20:53.835
No, the output.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.504
No, the A/C adapter.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.465
- Hey, maybe Daniel can
play something while we wait.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.512
- Oh, I didn't bring my guitar.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.972
- We really need
some music in here,

21:05.055 --> 21:06.765
so I'll make Daniel's guitar
now appear.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.393
- Well, too bad.
Maybe next time.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.938
Just wait till you hear
my jammin' mixes.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.189
- Here it is.

21:14.272 --> 21:17.359
We brought it, remember?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.361
- I don't remember
bringing my guitar,

21:19.444 --> 21:20.862
but, again,
there was so much stuff.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.115
- Play something.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.033
- Maddie, I don't like
playing in public.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.118
- I'm sure you'll be great.

21:27.327 --> 21:27.411
- Okay.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.209
- Am I dressed right
to meet the witches' council?

21:34.292 --> 21:36.753
Maybe I should replace my hat

21:36.837 --> 21:39.548
with this hat.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.551
I think it has more of
a sophisticated look to it.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.636
The witches' council
will love this hat, right?

21:44.720 --> 21:45.679
- Look, this is serious.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.806
Stand back.
