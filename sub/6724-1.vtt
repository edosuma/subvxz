01:07.330 --> 01:10.700
My apologies.
Let us serve you on the 1st floor.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.800
A sudden visit from
Governor-General Terauchi.

01:20.310 --> 01:25.880
Sontag Hotel. Gyeongseong, 1911

01:26.450 --> 01:27.520
Go downstairs.
-Yes, sir.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.050
Governor-General Terauchi!

01:31.120 --> 01:34.990
Count Lee Wan-yong!
Let's eat first!

01:35.260 --> 01:36.760
How is your health?

01:36.860 --> 01:39.930
Japanese medicine
seems to suit me.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.300
Is that so?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.770
Kang In-guk.
-Yes, sir.

01:46.430 --> 01:47.840
A business card in gold?

01:48.900 --> 01:49.600
Yes, sir.
-His face tells me...

01:49.700 --> 01:54.240
...it's not going to be free.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.550
Your Excellency!

01:58.050 --> 02:02.220
Since the poor peninsula of
Korea merged with Japan...

02:02.750 --> 02:09.660
...we're become a
vibrant industrial economy.

02:11.390 --> 02:14.960
If you could grant me the gold ore
mining rights in this peninsula...

02:17.070 --> 02:19.070
...I'd be most grateful.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.010
Operator!

02:38.320 --> 02:40.120
Are you hurt?

02:46.590 --> 02:48.930
I will take you to safety!

03:05.580 --> 03:07.380
The Governor-General
is in danger!

03:28.070 --> 03:32.270
I will protect you for sure!

03:34.440 --> 03:37.710
The Governor-General
is critically injured!

03:39.950 --> 03:42.480
Doctor, that's enough.

03:42.820 --> 03:44.190
You should be lying down!

03:44.190 --> 03:46.390
How is the Governor-General?

03:46.550 --> 03:49.120
The shock has left him
a bit loopy.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.530
But he remembers me?

03:51.190 --> 03:54.060
This is what he said.
"Kang In-guk is my friend."

03:54.100 --> 03:56.430
"Have my soldiers protect him
as they would me."

03:56.460 --> 03:57.630
What does that mean?

03:57.630 --> 03:59.630
-It means I can smell money! That's right!

04:01.170 --> 04:03.470
My twins' path to success
has been cleared.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.940
Clear two paths.
Since they're twins!

04:06.770 --> 04:08.880
What do you wish to ask?

04:08.880 --> 04:11.950
Did you reveal
today's meeting to anyone?

04:12.210 --> 04:13.210
No.
-Not even to your wife?

04:16.079 --> 04:17.750
Of course not.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.430
Did you say anything?
About today's meeting?

04:27.960 --> 04:31.130
To whom?
-The wet nurse, or anyone.

04:32.430 --> 04:34.800
Why don't you suspect me?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.800
Why you?

04:37.870 --> 04:41.010
Today, I was almost killed myself!

04:41.640 --> 04:43.680
Would that be so wrong?
-What?

04:43.680 --> 04:45.910
Japan conquered us
without even a fight.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.550
Don't we deserve better?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.820
We were just handed over.
By someone like you.

04:51.290 --> 04:54.660
Go inform on me.
I'll say we planned it together.

05:11.370 --> 05:14.340
Don't be scared.
Tonight I'll take him away.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.210
To where?
-Manchuria.

05:17.810 --> 05:18.810
Close the door.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.290
Ma'am, where are you
going so late at night?

05:26.050 --> 05:27.920
To visit my relatives
in Gaeseong.

05:28.590 --> 05:32.790
Darling, won't it be
a bit much for the twins?

05:32.790 --> 05:34.760
We should raise them strong.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.760
Please enjoy yourselves.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.360
Follow those
two carriages, quietly.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.440
And kill all of them.

05:49.110 --> 05:50.080
Your wife too?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.950
-Bring back my two daughters.

05:52.810 --> 05:53.810
Go.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.090
Split up!

06:15.200 --> 06:16.370
Get down.

06:29.295 --> 06:34.395
Throw away your gun!

06:34.420 --> 06:40.420
Don't move!
Police!

06:57.250 --> 06:58.550
I'm sorry, ma'am.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.550
Close your eyes.

07:01.150 --> 07:03.120
Why should I close
my eyes for you?

07:06.700 --> 07:10.100
Assassination

07:13.130 --> 07:16.060
Attempted murder in 1911 of the
Governor-General and Lee Wan-yong!

07:16.260 --> 07:17.770
But it's not in the paper.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.850
Only the jail break of Yem Sek-jin.
They controlled the news, that's why.

07:25.670 --> 07:26.170
They captured Yem and
he escaped 10 days later.

07:26.170 --> 07:28.840
The first man ever to escape
Central Police Station.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.850
He was a legend.

07:30.850 --> 07:34.120
He had two bullet holes in him so
he plugged them with his fingers...

07:34.120 --> 07:35.850
...and rode to Manchuria.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.320
How long were you with Yem?

07:39.520 --> 07:43.120
About 15 years?

07:43.420 --> 07:46.090
We both served under Kim Koo....

07:46.090 --> 07:47.130
Kim made Yem a police chief

07:47.130 --> 07:48.800
...so Yem punished most of the spies.

07:49.060 --> 07:51.100
He was quite driven.

07:52.330 --> 07:56.970
But then why did Yem
try to kill you in Shanghai?

07:59.670 --> 08:03.910
Back then,
I was a Japanese spy.

08:05.150 --> 08:09.420
The Shanghai Advance,
initiated on January 28, 1932...

08:12.090 --> 08:17.060
...defeated the army in
the hands of foreign forces.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.460
The need to secure peace in Asia
justified the war.

08:34.679 --> 08:35.740
Who are you?

08:36.940 --> 08:38.150
Sorry.

08:38.350 --> 08:45.850
In Gyeongseong, in the spirit
of loyal patriotism...

08:46.450 --> 08:49.682
...Kang In-kook donated 10 airplanes
to the Japanese Imperial Army.

08:49.694 --> 08:52.990
Korea Garrison Commander Mamoru
then gave a rousing speech.

08:53.900 --> 08:54.900
Captain!

08:56.960 --> 08:58.200
There's a side door!

09:10.550 --> 09:11.980
You go that way.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.510
You try over there.

09:38.670 --> 09:42.510
Hangzhou

09:44.550 --> 09:46.310
Turn back, we're fishing here!

09:47.450 --> 09:50.180
They say the Provisional
Government of Korea is here.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.890
Who are you?

09:57.560 --> 10:01.530
Go tell him. I'm Kim Won-bong from Miryang.

10:07.570 --> 10:07.740
Kim Won-bong!
Long time no see.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.910
I couldn't attend
your wedding, sorry.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.770
Why'd you hold it in Beijing?
Are you mad at me?

10:14.380 --> 10:16.510
Well, I couldn't attend
your wife's funeral.

10:16.540 --> 10:19.510
We are both in hiding,
let's not fret over such things.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.520
Quite cozy in here.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.950
After fleeing from Shanghai,
we made do with what we had.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.910
Still, we have all we need.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.080
The legislature. The judiciary.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.190
The executive branch is eating.

10:33.690 --> 10:35.200
Then, shall we go in?

10:41.540 --> 10:42.670
You two know each other?
-Of course.

10:42.670 --> 10:45.310
Good to see you're still alive.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.010
Just barely.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.540
But what is all this about, sir?

10:49.540 --> 10:51.650
We need some guns fired
in Gyeongseong.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.480
Gather these people.

10:53.510 --> 10:55.480
Good work.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.390
Let's try to cooperate like this.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.890
Who is the target?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.660
You can read about it
in the papers later.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.290
But why use them instead
of our members?

11:04.330 --> 11:07.730
Because the Japanese
don't know their faces.

11:07.730 --> 11:10.500
Do only the three of us know
about this operation?

11:10.500 --> 11:13.800
The hunchback knows a bit.
Has he been caught?

11:13.830 --> 11:15.800
He's on the wanted list.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.010
The woman's sentenced to death.

11:18.210 --> 11:21.940
Ahn Okyun! Sniper, 3rd Unit,
Korea Independence Army.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.880
Jailed for shooting her superior,

11:23.880 --> 11:25.210
but they'll hand her over.

11:25.250 --> 11:29.050
Duk-sam! He learned explosives
from a Hungarian...

11:29.050 --> 11:32.950
...but was caught and jailed
for selling substandard product.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.820
This is Chu Sang-ok.
Also called Big Gun.

11:35.820 --> 11:40.260
A bit indolent, but he trained
in the Military School for Independence.

11:40.290 --> 11:43.460
They're both in the same jail.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.770
Bring all three to Shanghai.

11:45.770 --> 11:49.400
10am, last day of October.
Hotel Mirabeau.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.910
But have they all agreed?

11:50.910 --> 11:54.310
Well, it's your job
to convince them.

12:08.590 --> 12:09.620
What was that sound?

12:15.930 --> 12:16.930
Oh no!

12:18.270 --> 12:25.770
What was that?

12:26.270 --> 12:27.540
What was that sound?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.940
I didn't hear anything.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.610
Don't mind me.
-Don't move.

12:32.610 --> 12:35.020
I've got a cold,
don't come in!

12:36.220 --> 12:37.380
How can you come out?

12:44.760 --> 12:46.690
Got me worked up in a sweat.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.960
Bro, can you take me with you?

12:50.800 --> 12:54.070
I've come to respect you,
these two months.

13:00.810 --> 13:03.880
What do you think you're doing?
-Shut up, you!

13:17.930 --> 13:19.990
Why won't this open?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.530
Duk-sam!
-Yes?

13:52.460 --> 13:54.960
Duk-sam is in
one of those cells.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.200
Chu Sang-ok.
You open it from this side.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.200
Is that so?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.000
Thank you very much.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.210
Who do they want us to rub out?

14:08.210 --> 14:10.640
I don't know,
I just follow orders.

14:10.850 --> 14:15.320
Go with this guy and meet Kim Won-bong.
At Hotel Mirabeau in Shanghai.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.020
-Kim Won-bong wants to see me?

14:17.020 --> 14:19.020
That's quite an honour.

14:21.490 --> 14:25.430
I don't understand, why me?

14:25.430 --> 14:27.030
Because I've no wife or kids?

14:27.290 --> 14:29.600
This anti-Japanese
resistance movement...

14:29.600 --> 14:32.130
...I've been riled up
about it for 3-4 years.

14:32.500 --> 14:36.540
But not on an empty stomach.
They should pay something.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.540
You trained at
the Military School?

14:39.570 --> 14:41.980
You signed an oath
in blood at graduation?

14:42.410 --> 14:43.410
Me?

14:44.180 --> 14:48.080
Did I? After ten years,
I barely remember.

14:48.120 --> 14:48.920
Before the leaves fall......

14:48.920 --> 14:50.973
-I remember! I wrote that line

14:50.985 --> 14:53.420
...and then had
a sudden attack of anaemia.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.313
Before the leaves fall,
I want to cross...

14:55.325 --> 14:57.320
...the Yalu River with my gun.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.090
That's an impressive oath.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.800
Let's cross the river, okay?

15:08.570 --> 15:11.810
I'll ask Kim Won-bong
for the money.

15:19.510 --> 15:23.080
Korean Independence
Army Post, Manchuria

15:23.280 --> 15:24.650
Men coming!

15:29.760 --> 15:30.760
Greetings.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.000
We request a transfer
of Corporal Ahn Ok-yun.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.870
Where's the General?
-He's scouting now.

15:38.870 --> 15:43.500
An offensive
is planned at dawn. This way.

15:44.510 --> 15:49.280
But tell me. Why did Ahn
Ok-yun shoot that officer?

15:49.940 --> 15:52.550
She shot him by accident.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.190
She was wrongly convicted.
-I see.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.750
Order of Special Release
Corporal Ahn Okyun...

15:59.750 --> 16:04.460
...to be transferred
to Provisional Government.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.030
Miss Corporal, come out.
This is Captain Yem.

16:13.030 --> 16:14.030
MY gun.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.940
Do you have bad eyesight?

16:17.340 --> 16:18.340
A bit.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.810
Does that make you nervous?

16:21.610 --> 16:24.080
I heard you took part
in a few assassinations.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.810
I don't remember.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.350
Where am I going?

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
Gyeongseong.

16:29.120 --> 16:32.020
-That's good. Always wanted to go there.

16:32.020 --> 16:32.990
-Thanks. 

16:32.990 --> 16:34.760
Why do you want to go there?

16:35.360 --> 16:40.830
Well, try some coffee. Find a lover.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.300
But the work comes first,
Captain Yem. Shall we go?

16:44.570 --> 16:45.570
-Yes.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.400
Okyun, stay healthy!

16:51.340 --> 16:53.170
Be sure to come back alive.

16:53.670 --> 16:55.740
You just focus on the battle.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
I'll be back.
-Bye, Okyun!

16:58.150 --> 16:59.550
Goodbye.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.420
Blow out the light!

17:39.090 --> 17:40.350
What are you doing?
-The battle's supposed to...

17:40.350 --> 17:42.990
...start at dawn.
I need to warn them.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.020
No.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.460
Looks like the battle's starting.

17:47.490 --> 17:49.460
We need to leave quietly.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.570
I can't leave like this.
I'll just get the machine guns.

17:57.100 --> 18:00.810
Alright.
Just two machine guns.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.380
Thank you.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.320
It's too dark.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.490
When the battle starts,
they set off flares.

18:19.930 --> 18:20.990
It's too far off.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.130
Him'? WOW?

18:26.730 --> 18:30.370
About that.
Come on, the flare.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.530
You really shot
that officer by accident?

18:48.860 --> 18:50.760
Says who?
It was on purpose.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.560
We picked the right person.
Let's go.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.080
Japanese Consulate, Shanghai

19:00.430 --> 19:02.490
Korean clans never work together.

19:02.490 --> 19:06.140
But Kim Koo and Kim Won-bong...

19:06.140 --> 19:06.870
...plan a joint assassination
in Gyeongseong?

19:06.870 --> 19:07.610
Where'd you hear that?
-I didn't hear it.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.610
I'm their messenger.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.550
I handed over the money.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.820
Kim Koo thinks
I skimmed off the top.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.480
So did you?

19:17.480 --> 19:19.490
A little bit.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.370
How much will
you pay for this tip?

19:23.360 --> 19:24.360
What should we do?

19:26.130 --> 19:29.660
Who's the target?
-I don't know that.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.030
If it's true, we'll pay.

19:33.770 --> 19:36.570
Check the info first.
-Yes, sir!

19:38.340 --> 19:39.210
French Concession, Shanghai

19:51.290 --> 19:52.990
So we part ways here?
-Yes, unfortunately.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.250
Indeed.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.660
-Take care of yourself.

19:56.960 --> 19:57.960
Sure.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.730
Let's g0!

20:07.460 --> 20:09.660
Hotel Mirabeau

20:17.140 --> 20:19.450
I'm sorry.
-Learn some Japanese!

20:20.510 --> 20:22.950
I've reserved a room.

20:24.320 --> 20:28.620
Those Japanese gangsters
on the wanted list are here.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.460
Coffee for me too.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
Enjoy.

20:43.340 --> 20:45.140
The books say it tastes good.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.470
It's bitter.

20:47.110 --> 20:48.180
You need to add sugar.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.670
Attention everyone!

21:16.940 --> 21:18.910
Bonjour!
I'm Inspector Melville.

21:18.910 --> 21:22.540
Please show me your ID.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.810
Everyone take out your ID!

21:28.420 --> 21:32.590
Be careful,
they put a price on your head!

21:36.190 --> 21:37.390
Identification!
-I'm French. I'm staying here.

21:37.420 --> 21:43.200
Alright.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.400
What are you doing?

21:48.370 --> 21:50.040
Compatriots
should help each other.

21:51.740 --> 21:52.910
Hey! Identification.

21:53.910 --> 21:54.910
Identification?

21:56.580 --> 21:59.580
Honey, is our ID in the room?

22:02.650 --> 22:04.450
Are you two married?

22:10.420 --> 22:14.630
Yes, he's my husband.

22:15.030 --> 22:19.100
Do you just let Japanese
gangsters come and go here?

22:20.570 --> 22:23.470
Of course not.
-Okay, back to the post.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.500
Yes, sir.

22:34.210 --> 22:37.420
May I ask your name?
-Why do you want to know?

22:43.860 --> 22:46.730
Shame to leave without
learning my wife's name.

22:56.340 --> 22:57.340
Follow them.

23:08.350 --> 23:12.150
Myung-woo!

23:14.250 --> 23:15.620
-So what's she like?

23:15.660 --> 23:17.420
You should see her shoot.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.890
We ran into some
Japanese soldiers...

23:18.930 --> 23:21.660
...she killed four men
with four bullets, right?

23:22.200 --> 23:24.160
This operation
got to be successful.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.170
Yes, I need to burn her photo.
-Now? Should I do it?

23:27.170 --> 23:29.640
No, I need to use the toilet.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.740
You guys eat.

23:49.820 --> 23:52.890
Hey, Myung Woo Order noodles for me.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.130
Another bowl!

23:59.170 --> 24:02.170
Duk-sam, Chu Sang-ok
and Ahn Okyun.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.470
Tomorrow at 10am...

24:04.500 --> 24:09.240
...they'll meet Kim Won-bong
at Hotel Mirabeau.

24:09.280 --> 24:10.440
Oh, I'll catch a big fish.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.750
We'll catch him together.
And get rich together.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.750
Can we kill these three?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.620
Everyone dies someday.
-Very well.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.140
Did you do martial arts?

24:27.790 --> 24:29.230
Tennis.

24:29.760 --> 24:34.370
Tennis. That's a martial art?

24:34.770 --> 24:36.370
-You haven't heard of it.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.710
Whack a guy like this
and he'll be spitting blood.

24:40.410 --> 24:44.810
But how old are you anyway?

24:45.050 --> 24:46.550
I was born in 1900.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.920
I'm from the 1800's.

24:51.420 --> 24:52.750
Hold on.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.660
Mirabeau is this way,
so that way is a long life.

24:56.660 --> 24:59.530
Hey!
Come back!

24:59.530 --> 25:02.500
You scoundrel.
Are you even human?

25:03.260 --> 25:05.800
Don't you want your name
in the history books?

25:05.800 --> 25:08.340
What nonsense.
I want to live a long life.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.040
You just did Tennis?

25:10.040 --> 25:12.010
You're running away?
Hey, get back here!

25:14.670 --> 25:17.110
We're being followed.
Don't look!

25:17.140 --> 25:21.850
One man block the car,
one man take the driver.

25:21.850 --> 25:23.050
Go!

25:27.290 --> 25:29.160
Why are you following us?

25:29.290 --> 25:30.440
Aren't you going to Mirabeau?
Duk-sam?

25:30.440 --> 25:32.960
Chu Sang-ck.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.330
How come everywhere we go,
people know our names?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.600
Who are you?
-I'm Kim Won-bong.

25:54.150 --> 25:55.380
Who are you?
-I'm...

25:57.080 --> 26:01.720
Not so strong, are you?

26:01.760 --> 26:05.030
Comrade Duk-sam is about
to lose his thing.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.790
Wait!
I said, wait!

26:07.830 --> 26:09.930
This one doesn't look
so strong, either.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.930
Introduce yourselves.
Corporal Ahn Okyun.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.870
This is Duk-sam.
That's Chu Sang-ok.

26:14.870 --> 26:16.870
Weren't we meeting at 10am?

26:17.940 --> 26:21.140
You know the saying.
A smart rabbit digs three tunnels.

26:21.170 --> 26:23.310
Shall we open the bag?

26:23.940 --> 26:26.250
Sir, call me Big Gun
from now on.

26:30.780 --> 26:33.120
So, who do we have to kill?

26:33.320 --> 26:35.860
Take out the photos.

26:39.430 --> 26:42.370
After General Kim's
victory in Qingshanli...

26:42.370 --> 26:44.400
...Japanese troops
took revenge on...

26:44.700 --> 26:46.870
...Koreans living in Manchuria.

26:46.870 --> 26:51.100
They killed every man,
woman or child they saw.

26:51.140 --> 26:54.010
Comrade Ahn, you were there?

26:55.580 --> 26:58.750
My mother passed away
after being shot.

27:00.210 --> 27:01.310
She was fortunate.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.550
The others were
ripped open with knives...

27:07.950 --> 27:11.020
...beaten to death
with clubs, strangled...

27:11.360 --> 27:14.560
...burned in fires,
buried alive...

27:15.330 --> 27:17.330
...even boiled in cauldrons.

27:20.770 --> 27:24.300
Over 27 days,
3,469 people died.

27:24.540 --> 27:26.950
The 19th division
behind the massacre...

27:26.950 --> 27:30.240
...was led by
Kawaguchi Mamoru.

27:30.280 --> 27:34.650
He heads the Korea garrison,
and leaves soon for Japan.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.120
Let's not send him back alive.
-For sure.

27:38.790 --> 27:42.260
Kang In-guk, the leading
pro-Japanese lapdog...

27:42.260 --> 27:44.590
...is our second target.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.660
Kang In-guk and Kawaguchi...

27:46.690 --> 27:48.485
...will inspect the airplane
factory on November 7.

27:48.510 --> 27:56.530
That's when you kill them.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.470
Can we kill commoners when
we come into unavoidable circumstances?

28:02.780 --> 28:03.780
No, you can't.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.440
How about Japanese commoners?

28:08.620 --> 28:10.950
Commoners are innocent.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.950
Furthermore,
we can control who we shoot.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.130
Then, how about taking a photo?

28:19.130 --> 28:23.100
For the historical record.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.830
Comrade Ahn,
you can change clothes.

28:27.370 --> 28:30.670
We can't fight
on an empty stomach.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.310
Captain Yem said you would
cover our compensation.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.880
What's with you?
-He did.

28:40.450 --> 28:43.320
Did Captain Yem say that?

28:46.790 --> 28:49.490
Comrades.
I'm sorry, but...

28:49.490 --> 28:50.960
...do you happen
to have any money?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.871
Money?

29:00.830 --> 29:02.170
You win!

29:05.000 --> 29:06.740
No luck.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.520
Bye.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.030
Hawaii Pistol is
coming in 5 minutes?

29:28.030 --> 29:32.130
Hawaii Pistol?
-He's coming here?

29:40.210 --> 29:44.010
Hey, what's going on?
-I'm not sure.

29:46.150 --> 29:47.850
Get the car ready.
-Yes, boss.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.590
Hey, draw your guns.

30:16.740 --> 30:17.780
Help.

30:48.010 --> 30:50.980
Come here!

31:08.290 --> 31:11.200
Sir! If you open a window, you'll die!

31:12.770 --> 31:16.200
There's a price on
the Japanese gangsters.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.570
Is that Hawaii Pistol?
-They say he's Korean.

31:18.610 --> 31:19.940
No one's seen his face.
-He came from Hawaii and...

31:19.970 --> 31:25.350
...will kill anyone for $300.
He's a piece of trash.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.200
Let's go get our cash, sir.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.350
Let's take our photo.
-Yes.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.760
Sir!
Thank you for choosing me.

32:13.790 --> 32:17.760
But who is the leader?
-Ahn Okyun.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.200
Why me?

32:19.570 --> 32:21.400
You should find
the reason yourself.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.540
Anyone uncomfortable
with a female captain?

32:23.540 --> 32:24.170
I am.
-Then let me ask.

32:24.200 --> 32:27.110
Why were you convicted?

32:27.770 --> 32:31.180
For shooting my superior.
-You be captain, then.

32:31.180 --> 32:34.450
Leave before sunrise.
It's a long way to Gyeongseong.

32:34.710 --> 32:39.520
After arriving, connect
with the madam at Cafe Anemone.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.790
<i>Cafe Anemone. Smile. Look happy.</i>

32:46.430 --> 32:49.260
Say, "Long Live Korea!"

32:49.700 --> 32:52.870
Long Live Korea!

33:00.710 --> 33:02.010
Get me some water.

33:13.990 --> 33:15.460
Captain!
-It won't kill you.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.240
Did they depart safely?
-Yes. Let's go, sir.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.920
I'll finish this cigarette.

33:59.670 --> 34:01.390
The room is empty.
I think they already left.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.370
That can't be!

34:08.110 --> 34:09.380
Send this message.
-Yes, sir.

34:09.880 --> 34:10.880
Out of the way!

34:17.120 --> 34:21.050
Hotel Mirabeau operation fail.

34:21.090 --> 34:25.560
Request assassination target.

34:51.920 --> 34:58.490
Kang In-guk. Commander
of the Korea garrison. November 7.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.150
 Myeong Woo?
yes?

35:24.820 --> 35:26.290
Where is Captain Yem?

35:26.350 --> 35:28.320
Downstairs.
Should I call him?

35:28.490 --> 35:30.790
No.
Can I borrow your gun?

35:31.360 --> 35:33.290
Shall I load it?

35:34.290 --> 35:36.030
No need.

35:59.790 --> 36:00.790
Captain Yem.

36:01.190 --> 36:03.190
Oh, hello sir!
You weren't sleeping?

36:03.660 --> 36:04.780
I wish I could.

36:05.460 --> 36:08.590
Sasaki raided the Mirabeau,
so we have a leak?

36:10.600 --> 36:12.000
Who could have done that?

36:12.870 --> 36:14.570
I like you.

36:15.330 --> 36:16.940
A born resistance fighter.

36:17.740 --> 36:21.670
At times a scholar
and at times a gangster.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.440
Why this, all of a sudden?

36:26.310 --> 36:29.720
You still think about it?
Your time in the prison?

36:31.820 --> 36:35.190
Yes, I do.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.140
What did you think as
you were waiting to be shot?

36:53.510 --> 36:56.010
What if you didn't escape
from the police station...

36:56.680 --> 36:58.710
...but you agreed
to become a spy?

37:00.810 --> 37:04.520
If you'd begged Sasaki
to spare you?

37:05.420 --> 37:09.520
If so?
Then I'll die right now.

37:24.600 --> 37:29.740
I have truly respected you.

37:37.820 --> 37:38.720
Let's say none of
this ever happened.

37:38.780 --> 37:40.590
How can you suspect me?

37:41.990 --> 37:43.690
It could be someone at the Hotel!

37:45.630 --> 37:46.950
I suppose it could.

37:47.230 --> 37:52.000
Sir, should I go tomorrow
and interrogate the hotel staff?

37:53.870 --> 37:55.530
Go to Shanghai tomorrow, then.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.920
Kim Koo suspects me.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.730
DR! you search Y em's home'?

38:20.330 --> 38:22.060
We found a wireless telegraph
and codebook.

38:22.090 --> 38:25.100
Was there money?
-Yes. We left it there for now.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.300
If Yem meets Sasaki
in Shanghai tomorrow...

38:29.670 --> 38:30.800
...he's a spy for sure.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.340
If he's a spy, kill him.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.860
Passengers on the train
from China...

39:15.350 --> 39:17.620
Oh, there she is.
-A new bargirl?

39:17.920 --> 39:19.720
She's my niece.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.920
Thanks for your help.
Good to see you!

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
Keep your composure.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.990
Thanks you two for
delivering the alcohol.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.300
This way, right?

39:38.940 --> 39:39.940
Take off your hat.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.710
-This is the 6pm notice.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.210
Everyone turn and
salute the nearest flag.

40:34.590 --> 40:36.530
Thank you for coming
all the way to here.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.430
It is hard to get weapons
here in Gyeongseong.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.230
Where does this lead to?

40:41.670 --> 40:43.240
There's a sewer tunnel
right behind it.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.030
So when do we start?

40:45.240 --> 40:48.510
Kang In-guk's daughter Mitsuko
has returned from Tokyo.

40:49.610 --> 40:52.580
The garrison leader's son
is also coming to Gyeongseong.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.810
In 5 days,
the two families...

40:55.310 --> 40:59.290
...will have breakfast
at Kang's...

40:59.750 --> 41:01.090
...and visit the factory.

41:02.350 --> 41:05.390
We need to hit the targets
on their way to Gyeongseong Station.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.730
Traffic slows around here,
let's get them then.

41:08.990 --> 41:10.800
Will they have a military escort?

41:11.360 --> 41:13.800
Yes, soldiers stationed
at every corner.

41:14.470 --> 41:18.740
So we should wage war
in the mouth of the army?

41:21.510 --> 41:23.340
What's this?
-A gasoline store.

41:28.450 --> 41:31.250
Are there others on the way
to Gyeongseong Station?

41:34.050 --> 41:35.050
No.

41:35.190 --> 41:38.420
Then if Kawaguchi and Kang
need to stop for gasoline?

41:41.590 --> 41:44.300
They'd turn left
and come in here.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.400
The soldiers can't
leave their posts...

41:47.570 --> 41:49.130
...so we'll just need
to face their guards.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.870
Let's seize
the gasoline store and wait.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.440
Duk-sam, ride past on a bike...

41:54.510 --> 41:56.880
...and bomb the car.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.350
Big Gun and I will shoot
the targets and guards.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.350
We'll finish in 5 minutes
and come back alive.

42:06.920 --> 42:07.720
What's our escape plan?
-That night you take the train...

42:08.050 --> 42:10.390
...to lncheon.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.360
Then board the Irish ferry
for Shanghai at 23:00.

42:15.430 --> 42:16.430
What's 23:00?

42:17.800 --> 42:19.120
I thought the clock
went up to 12?

42:22.840 --> 42:24.270
They lengthened it recently.

42:24.740 --> 42:26.140
At first, I took you for a person
of average intelligence...

42:26.470 --> 42:31.650
...but that plan's idiotic.
Why would they come get gas?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.480
Someone will make them come.
-Who?

42:36.020 --> 42:37.020
Us.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.550
I should've run
when I had the chance.

42:42.790 --> 42:43.890
Oh, I want to get drunk.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.090
You should.
We're in a bar, right?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.570
It's too long since
I've heard music.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.900
My life is nothing
but hardship.

43:01.770 --> 43:03.050
Gyeongseong is colder than
Shanghai.

43:03.940 --> 43:05.040
No, I'm fine.

43:09.920 --> 43:10.920
Wow, look at our captain!

43:11.880 --> 43:12.880
Have a drink.

43:13.790 --> 43:16.690
Madam, I hear
Gyeongseong's gone decadent?

43:17.390 --> 43:18.660
Let's have a dance!

43:19.890 --> 43:20.930
Do you know how to dance?

43:21.430 --> 43:23.560
You just have
to grab on and shake.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.500
Nice dancing!

43:32.240 --> 43:35.370
A Japanese punk?
-A Japanese punk named Kimura.

43:36.180 --> 43:38.010
I support Korean independence.

43:38.340 --> 43:40.450
I've worked for her for 10 years.

43:43.220 --> 43:45.280
Really?
We could all die tomorrow.

43:45.980 --> 43:47.280
Let's dance!

44:23.280 --> 44:24.440
When will you kill Kim Koo?

44:24.860 --> 44:27.730
I need an exit plan
before I can kill him.

44:28.930 --> 44:30.130
Wait a bit.

44:30.800 --> 44:34.930
The information?
-November 7, two targets.

44:35.430 --> 44:37.200
Kawaguchi Mamoru
and Kang In-guk.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.040
Oh, real bigwigs.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.620
How many people to kill?
-Three.

44:55.250 --> 44:57.490
Nationality?
-Korean.

44:58.660 --> 45:01.660
Korea's gone from the map.

45:02.230 --> 45:04.350
They're all Cubans, Americans,
Mexicans, Chinese now.

45:08.170 --> 45:12.100
So, how much should
I charge for three?

45:13.110 --> 45:15.910
I'd rather talk to
Hawaii Pistol, not you.

45:18.880 --> 45:22.150
I don't look
like Hawaii Pistol?

45:23.820 --> 45:24.820
Why not?

45:26.720 --> 45:27.720
Location?

45:28.190 --> 45:29.190
Gyeongseong.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.590
SYeongseong? That's far.

45:36.460 --> 45:38.400
But who are you anyway?

45:39.360 --> 45:40.830
Independence fighters.

45:43.670 --> 45:46.110
Ah, I hate getting mixed up
with those beggars here.

45:46.410 --> 45:50.480
Hey! Let me hear your voice.
Don't hide like a coward.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.550
$2000 per person!
Another $1000 each at the end.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.850
But if you fail...
-Have you gone mad?

45:57.180 --> 45:58.780
If you see his face, you die!

46:03.560 --> 46:06.590
And if we fail? What then?

46:06.690 --> 46:09.630
If you fail, it won't end
with you returning the cash.

46:10.700 --> 46:13.800
I'll forget your face.
Just get it done by Nov. 7.

46:23.010 --> 46:24.010
An independence fighter?

46:25.480 --> 46:26.480
Who's your superior?

46:27.910 --> 46:29.750
Why do you care?
You get the money anyway.

46:32.580 --> 46:34.420
Why do these three Koreans
need to die?

46:34.820 --> 46:37.260
They are spies for Japan.

46:38.660 --> 46:41.630
Why? You know them?

46:43.330 --> 46:44.850
A vagabond like me
doesn't know anyone.

46:46.670 --> 46:47.670
See you in 10 days.

46:51.840 --> 46:53.400
Something doesn't feel right.

46:53.940 --> 46:55.640
Let's not meet for a while.

46:57.440 --> 47:00.780
They're blaming me for
losing Kim Won-bong.

47:01.350 --> 47:03.420
Fools. I'll go to the office
and contact Gyeongseong...

47:09.990 --> 47:12.560
Captain, give me your gun!
-Myung-woo! Se-gwang!

47:12.560 --> 47:13.030
Give me your gun!
-Listen to me, will you?

47:14.590 --> 47:17.130
Give me your gun, Captain!
-Myung-woo!

47:17.130 --> 47:20.770
I'll explain everything.
Just listen to me!

47:32.680 --> 47:35.880
Myeong Woo! Who sent you?

47:37.420 --> 47:38.450
Was it Kim Koo?

47:40.750 --> 47:42.490
Did he order you to kill me?

47:43.690 --> 47:48.630
MYung-woo. MYung-woo.

48:27.230 --> 48:31.700
The KIP, KRP, JRP, KHC, KCP.
30 independence factions...

48:33.240 --> 48:36.140
...all fighting with each other.

48:38.040 --> 48:41.780
All with different cash sources.
That's why they can't cooperate.

48:44.120 --> 48:50.760
Everyone's a thief. Everyone!

48:55.260 --> 48:57.975
And how come Kim Koo tried to kill me?

48:57.987 --> 49:00.500
I even told him I respected him!

49:16.400 --> 49:17.600
Sir!

49:31.830 --> 49:35.170
Mr. Yem. We can't really
protect you anymore.

49:36.130 --> 49:37.970
I'm worthless now, is that it?

49:39.040 --> 49:41.640
But there's still one place
where I fetch a good price.

49:43.910 --> 49:44.910
Where's that?

49:46.980 --> 49:47.980
Gyeongseong.

49:55.020 --> 49:56.820
You know what that
pretty bird's name is?

49:57.890 --> 49:59.390
"Money Girl."

50:00.890 --> 50:02.530
But you're making me worried.

50:02.590 --> 50:05.360
You keep staring
at Money Girl's photo.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.860
Time for you to get married?

50:11.400 --> 50:13.600
I'm more worried that
you can't speak Japanese.

50:16.740 --> 50:19.340
Where are you travelling to?
-Gyeongseong. ls there a problem?

50:19.810 --> 50:21.750
Officers may sit
in the VIP compartment.

50:22.650 --> 50:23.650
This way.

50:40.730 --> 50:44.770
If you're navy,
you're coming from Shanghai?

50:45.670 --> 50:47.270
What were your duties in Shanghai?
-Killing people.

50:47.770 --> 50:58.850
I'm with Kwantung Army,
23rd Division.

51:00.450 --> 51:02.130
Lieutenant Kawaguchi.
-2nd Lieutenant Tanaka.

51:02.590 --> 51:05.660
This is 1st Lieutenant Nakamura.

51:06.760 --> 51:07.760
Nakamura?

51:10.700 --> 51:12.760
Was he injured
while fighting Koreans?

51:16.900 --> 51:18.770
Did you kill many Koreans?

51:19.840 --> 51:22.640
Yes.

51:24.080 --> 51:26.550
Sir, did you kill many?

51:35.120 --> 51:36.590
What's your business
in Gyeongseong?

51:36.990 --> 51:37.990
It's a secret operation.

51:38.790 --> 51:40.660
I'm going to get married.

51:42.460 --> 51:43.600
To a Korean woman.

51:44.230 --> 51:47.100
Then, let's keep it
a secret from her.

52:01.910 --> 52:04.720
I'll see you later, Tanaka.

52:04.780 --> 52:06.050
It was a pleasure.
-Take care.

52:09.350 --> 52:11.660
If I see that punk again,
I'll rip out his guts.

52:15.790 --> 52:18.300
Buddy, where in this
big city shall we start?

52:18.960 --> 52:21.930
As usual, the rickshaw company.

52:33.350 --> 52:34.680
Hey, what are you doing?

52:37.380 --> 52:40.590
What's happening here?
-Speak Korean, you!

52:41.950 --> 52:43.130
People who get off
at Gyeongseong Station...

52:43.130 --> 52:46.090
...they all take
your rickshaws, right?

52:46.160 --> 52:49.260
Yes, right.
-That's why we're here.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.070
This guy knows!
-I don't know the men.

52:55.270 --> 52:55.800
But this lady, she arrived
in Gyeongseong a few days ago?

52:55.830 --> 53:01.640
Yes.
Her name is...

53:03.040 --> 53:04.140
Thank you.
Her name is Mitsuko.

53:04.140 --> 53:08.080
The daughter
of Mr. Kang In-guk.

53:09.310 --> 53:10.720
Kang In-guk's daughter Mitsuko.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.450
Thank you, compatriots!

53:16.690 --> 53:18.620
But what unit are...

53:18.990 --> 53:21.430
The motorbike outside, it's yours?

53:22.090 --> 53:23.660
Yes.
-Thanks for lending it.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.330
Wait!

53:34.310 --> 53:37.610
You think I'm building
a factory to make bicycles?

53:37.810 --> 53:38.810
Of course not.

53:39.740 --> 53:42.180
Believe me, within 10 years
there will be war.

53:42.180 --> 53:45.280
Then I'll make money
and acquire a rank.

53:54.030 --> 53:55.560
What's going on?
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

53:55.590 --> 53:56.560
I'm sorry. It was our fault.
-You, fool!

53:56.700 --> 54:02.100
My apologies.

54:04.300 --> 54:06.940
I'll get it repaired for you.

54:09.310 --> 54:10.310
Hurry UP!

54:11.180 --> 54:13.280
Get it done today.
-I will.

54:16.950 --> 54:20.220
Buy some new glasses,
at the department store.

54:47.910 --> 54:51.250
Right now,
in the first floor hall...

54:51.250 --> 54:52.950
...a fashion show is taking place
highlighting the newest Tokyo trends.

54:53.220 --> 54:54.590
Perfume from Japan...

54:55.150 --> 54:57.990
What?
-it's on sale.

55:01.730 --> 55:03.010
Where do they sell glasses?

55:03.400 --> 55:05.730
Over there.

55:06.130 --> 55:07.130
Thanks.

55:09.470 --> 55:10.500
Is that clear?
-Yes.

55:11.870 --> 55:12.970
Not this one?
-That's correct.

55:13.170 --> 55:15.210
It will be ready.
Come back tomorrow.

55:15.740 --> 55:19.710
You can't do it today?
-Then write down your address.

55:20.080 --> 55:20.980
Why my address?
-We run a...

55:21.050 --> 55:23.620
...late-night delivery service.

55:45.540 --> 55:47.140
It suits you perfectly.

55:48.440 --> 55:50.980
We received this one piece
from Tokyo yesterday.

55:52.110 --> 55:53.550
This is a dilemma.

55:54.950 --> 55:57.750
It's twice as expensive as
the department store in Tokyo.

55:58.020 --> 56:00.020
But I wouldn't want
another woman wearing it.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.760
Mitsuko, what's wrong?

56:09.930 --> 56:11.410
Nothing. Pay for this.

56:18.870 --> 56:22.310
It's a special sale.

56:24.140 --> 56:25.140
Sorry!

56:25.440 --> 56:27.410
Why?
-I made you angry just before.

56:31.850 --> 56:34.350
Kawaguchi.
Let's end our date for today.

56:34.820 --> 56:35.820
Goodbye.

56:37.190 --> 56:38.190
What happened?

57:10.690 --> 57:11.260
Papa?

57:11.390 --> 57:13.530
-He's not home. Shall I put on some tea?

57:13.860 --> 57:14.860
-No. 

57:16.330 --> 57:19.360
Mister!

57:20.630 --> 57:22.670
Can I have a word with you?
We've got a real complication here.

57:23.400 --> 57:26.500
Don't sit like that.
You're about to get married.

57:27.310 --> 57:28.870
It's a marriage of convenience.

57:29.270 --> 57:31.410
I know, it's how the world works.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.510
It's a marriage
of lavish benefits.

57:34.650 --> 57:35.650
A question!

57:36.850 --> 57:39.820
When I was little,
my twin sister died?

57:40.550 --> 57:42.720
After being kidnapped
by a robber, right?

57:43.290 --> 57:44.420
Yes, that's right.

57:45.090 --> 57:46.560
But she didn't die then.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.690
Because I saw her today!

57:58.570 --> 58:00.340
This isn't the first time
you've said that.

58:01.140 --> 58:03.980
Alright, so where was it
you saw her?

58:04.180 --> 58:06.410
The department store.

58:12.480 --> 58:14.320
For now, keep it secret
from Papa, okay?

58:14.590 --> 58:18.720
Is this the home of Kang In-guk?

58:18.920 --> 58:19.690
-Yes, it is.

58:19.920 --> 58:24.160
Wow, American cars are
known for sturdy fenders.

58:25.700 --> 58:28.400
We'll replace this and
give the car a look over.

58:28.570 --> 58:29.870
Bring me some cold water.

58:30.070 --> 58:31.630
Sure, we'll leave it to you.
-Okay.

58:31.770 --> 58:32.770
God, look at that.

58:59.160 --> 59:02.500
So Money Girl is his daughter?

59:02.670 --> 59:03.970
She didn't look rich.
-Pardon?

59:04.070 --> 59:06.740
Nothing, keep watching.

59:12.280 --> 59:14.610
What's this?
-You asked for water...

59:14.810 --> 59:15.910
Oh, water!

59:17.150 --> 59:18.750
No other problems with the car.
-Very well.

59:20.220 --> 59:21.420
We got lucky, sir.

59:22.150 --> 59:23.920
They fell into our laps.

59:33.230 --> 59:37.640
I'll go ahead. I'll pick
up my Thompson from the cafe.

59:38.340 --> 59:41.240
You follow that car
and check the location.

59:41.340 --> 59:43.140
I'll start with this guy here.

59:43.440 --> 59:44.510
Sure.

59:49.780 --> 59:51.450
Hello.

59:53.450 --> 59:56.220
Did this girl stop by today?

59:56.820 --> 59:58.760
The perfume seller
directed me here.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.500
Here. We plan to deliver
her glasses tonight.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:18.480
Give me two, please.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.550
Goodbye.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.760
Hey, can I have a light?

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.760
Sure.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.730
Thanks.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.470
I guess you're
heading there too?

01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:49.310
To the famous pork restaurant?
-Yes.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:54.910
You know why Korean pork
tastes so good these days?

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:56.050
Not sure.

01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.450
They castrate them all.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.950
I learned it in
agricultural school.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:03.820
Male pigs are hard to control.

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:05.930
But if you cut off theirs,
they get real tame.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.090
The meat gets nice
and tender too.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.800
Is that so?

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.800
This way, here.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.000
But you know I bet the
pigs probably want to keep theirs.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.470
Most likely.

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.240
The Japanese...

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:24.980
...it's like they're
cutting off Koreans'.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.780
What I mean is, there's no pork
restaurant down there.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.170
If you get my meaning.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.800
Who are you?
-You don't need to know.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.440
Is that so?
I understand!

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.950
All's quiet with the police,

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.020
so I don't think he's caught.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:44.490
That scoundrel.
What is he doing?

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.790
Did he really run off?

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:51.060
Anyway, here are your
boat tickets for tomorrow.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:56.800
What do we do now, Captain?

01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.140
Have to go through with it.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.570
There's no one to pump gas.

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.870
I'll pump the gas. This is
the final stop, Gyeongseong Station.

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:22.830
That was delicious.

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:27.000
You're too kind.
-Mitsuko cooked it herself.

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:28.230
Is that so?

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:58.630
Let me use your phone.
-What for?

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:06.570
An urgent message
for the police.

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:07.570
Lieutenant Kawaguchi!

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:12.040
The police request you
to cancel your trip.

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.580
They've been informed of
an assassination plot.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.380
Commander, shall we cancel?

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:20.050
No.
People will mock us.

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:24.020
It's hardly
the first plot to kill me.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.720
Let's g0!

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:30.030
Shall we change cars?

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:34.470
Hello.
-Quiet!

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:38.440
Who are you?
-Go inside!

01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:58.820
What are those people doing?

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.030
The guy I shot yesterday
was acting odd too.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:05.830
You can't read someone's
character in their face.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.000
Let's kill the others,
get our $9000...

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.230
Go to Hawaii.

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:13.800
Buddy, you take the bicycle.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.970
Everyone!
Attention!

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.320
We are out of gas.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.420
Fill it quickly, and let's go.
-Yes, sir.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.920
Welcome!

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.040
What are you doing?
Move!

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.350
They changed cars!

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.390
It's that car there!

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:12.760
It's a bomb!

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:43.720
That car!

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.760
Look out, it's a grenade!

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.870
Start the car!

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:37.630
Let's g0!

01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:59.490
Step on it!
-Hurry!

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:56.450
Step on it!

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:38.490
Who are you?

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.790
What rotten luck.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.460
The Commander?
-Only minor wounds.

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:47.100
Kang is unharmed too.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:51.470
And the culprits?

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:54.540
The two captives are being
taken to Central Police Station.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:55.970
Watch them.
None of them shall leave.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.421
They were foiled,
thanks to you.

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:05.550
Thank you very much.
-No, thank you.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:09.120
We're fortunate to have
a man such as you.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.320
By any chance...

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.560
...was the woman next
to Kang In-guk...

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:19.390
...his daughter?
-Yes, that's Mitsuko.

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:44.120
Who are you?

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.130
Why'd you ruin our plot?
-I was hired.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.030
To kill you, Mitsuko.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.830
Mitsuko?

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:58.900
Kang In-guk's daughter Mitsuko
has returned from Tokyo.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.940
Shut up, you two.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:07.310
Don't talk to each other.

01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:13.750
You must be cold.
A shame to kill such a beauty.

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:19.260
What should we do? We
need to make him come in here.

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:22.160
Oh, how scary!

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.360
A kiss would probably do it.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.460
Are you insane?

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.000
I should've killed you back there.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.540
You want to stay in here?

01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:37.640
It's not because I like you.

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.610
What?

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.610
What's going on?

01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:57.860
-No key to the handcuffs.

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:15.810
UP there!

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.800
Pass them!

01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:18.480
Sir!
Money Girl!

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:49.470
What are you anyway?

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:57.980
Korean Independence Army. Sniper, 3rd Unit.

01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:24.240
Why bring a corpse
to the hospital?

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:30.880
Just toss her into a lake.
So troublesome.

01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:35.250
Doctor, could you take
something out of her shoulder?

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:49.230
She's not dead yet?

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:58.340
When will you kill her?

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.810
Later.
I'm out of bullets.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.620
Out of bullets?
You should've told me!

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.320
It seems there's a nail
in her shoulder.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.760
Send everyone out.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:20.260
Get out!
-You too.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:35.010
You just need to sterilize
and bandage it.

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.980
Who were you trying
to kill back there?

01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:43.150
Commander of the Korean Garrison.
National traitor Kang In-guk.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.660
Even after you found out
he's your father?

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:50.230
That trend passed a while back.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.100
Once, 8 pro-Japanese
collaborators received...

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.140
...the rank of baron in Japan. Their sons decided
each should kill one of the other's fathers.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:02.270
People called it
the Patricidal Club.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:04.340
Then...

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:11.620
...do you really think killing
those two will bring independence?

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.750
In Manchuria...

01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:19.220
...if the roof leaked,
we didn't fix it.

01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:24.390
We'll go home when Korea
is liberated, so why bother?

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:29.530
Will killing those two
bring independence?

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:34.740
Who knows.

01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.710
But we need to let them know.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.610
That we're still fighting.

01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:46.080
One shouldn't live only
for money, like you do.

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:49.850
Did you kill him?

01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:52.190
Our comrade, yesterday?

01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.560
Who sent you?

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.560
I don't know his name.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.830
He's missing one finger.

01:19:02.230 --> 01:19:03.530
Captain Yem?

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:08.670
He's the one who sent us here.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:20.780
In life, you know...

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:24.720
Every household has
their private tragedies.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.090
You too, sir,
I feel your pain...

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.690
...spreading through your soul
like a forest fire.

01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:32.230
Let it go, shoot the girl
and let's split.

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:33.460
We should go.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.500
But Buddy...

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:39.440
...before I could shoot her,
she escaped to Shanghai.

01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:41.970
Unfortunately, we've failed.

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:43.810
Isn't that right, Buddy?

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:46.010
No.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.520
Thank you, doctor.
-Yes.

01:19:56.850 --> 01:19:58.620
Can't believe this.

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:08.430
There goes our reputation
and the river of cash.

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:14.700
Do you see that?
-I do.

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:18.970
Get in line.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.550
I said, get in line!

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:31.960
You little ingrate!
What's your company?

01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:33.390
Who are you?
-Answer my question!

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.530
What?
-What's going on?

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:41.700
Carry on.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.030
-What? 

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:58.480
Tanaka!
What are you doing there?

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.480
Fools.

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:03.390
You inspect an imperial soldier
who risked his life...

01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:04.520
...fighting in Shanghai?

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:05.650
-What's his name again?

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.490
Nakamura?
Watanabe?

01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:13.330
Kawashima?

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:16.530
Lieutenant Kawaguchi!

01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.240
We meet again.

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:25.210
What happened to your arm?

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.640
This here?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.350
It's nothing.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.620
Did you complete
your secret operation?

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.290
That is finished.

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:38.220
Then would you serve
as a guard at my wedding?

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:45.390
I'm sorry.

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:47.060
I'm deeply sorry. Hey!

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.550
Why did you break
from the line?

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:20.960
Make everyone turn backward.
-Yes, sir!

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.430
Turn backward!

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:28.770
So that makes
four Koreans you've killed?

01:22:29.310 --> 01:22:30.310
Four?

01:22:30.670 --> 01:22:35.980
You mean this?
I meant 300, not 3.

01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.550
Visit me here tomorrow.
I'll give you the invitation card.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.760
Goodbye then.

01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:15.320
Ahn Okyun 23 Ahyeon Street.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.600
Isn't this the man
who tried to kill me once?

01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:36.240
And saved your life this morning.

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:38.940
Now he wants
to sell me information?

01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.450
How'd an independence fighter
end up here?

01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:47.980
If you can't bite,
you shouldn't bark.

01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:51.720
I'll need 100,000 won
for this information.

01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:56.160
Have the nerve to name
your price in front of me?

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.660
Three assassins
were sent from Shanghai...

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.400
...and one of those is
identical to your daughter.

01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:06.270
Is she the daughter who was
kidnapped by the wet nurse?

01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:09.840
That woman fired at me
and the Commander?

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.510
Does the Commander
know about this?

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:17.150
I haven't informed him yet.

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.420
He must never find out.

01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.420
I have something to tell you.

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:26.120
I know where she is staying.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.330
I was going to inform you...
-Why you!

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:33.530
Our home is in danger and
you're just going to watch?

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.990
Where'd you come from?
Why did you shoot at us?

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:06.360
I heard that
I had a twin sister.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:10.270
You really do look just like me.
-Why did you try to kill Daddy?

01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.940
I came to kill a traitor.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.870
A traitor?

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.640
That's why you wanted to kill him?

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.710
Everyone lives that way here.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.050
Daddy's a nice man.

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.920
Do you really believe that?

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:43.630
Meeting you, really.

01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:48.810
I burned that.
Wear this instead.

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.810
I respect
independence fighters too.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.740
But I wish you weren't one.

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.580
There's a taxi
waiting downstairs.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.180
Let's take it back home.

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:01.080
Daddy will take care
of everything, okay?

01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:05.130
Why should I go there?

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.860
I'm going back to Manchuria.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.030
What's in Manchuria?

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.360
My friends.

01:26:11.530 --> 01:26:12.900
And mother's grave.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.640
Check if this is Mommy.

01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:25.280
That's her. On the left.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.240
-That's the wet nurse.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.780
Mommy's on the right.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:38.150
You sure you came alone?
-Yes.

01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:45.700
You stay inside.

01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:50.000
I'll take care of this.
I'm Kawaguchi's future bride.

01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:31.980
You're a frightening man.

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.740
First your wife
and now your daughter.

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:39.480
I don't know who is she.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.690
Let's say this.

01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:51.290
This woman made another
attempt to kill you...

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.130
...but while apprehending her,
she was shot.

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:27.960
There you are, Miss.

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:30.090
Shall I take you back home?

01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:33.540
No.
-Very well.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.120
Taxi!

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:01.900
Attention!

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.870
We're here, Miss.

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:20.480
Welcome back, Miss.

01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:13.770
You're not going to your room?

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:19.440
Please put this in my room.
You're acting strange.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.340
You don't need to say
"please" to me.

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:40.560
Take a rest.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.680
What's gotten into you?
Going to get the invitation?

01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:35.420
Kawaguchi will die
by my hand tomorrow.

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:38.320
Are you some kind
of freedom fighter?

01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:41.060
What if people hear you killed
a Japanese officer for free?

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:44.060
Then the Provisional Government
will be pestering you.

01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:48.460
They'll be asking you
to toss bombs for free.

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:49.830
What will you do then?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.100
If you keep farting,
sooner you'll be in trouble.

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.440
Come on, sir. Sit down here.
-That's why I like you, Buddy.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.580
You know why they castrate pigs?

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.400
Why should I care
about castrating pigs?

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.780
But I do care about your life.

01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:10.050
Your mother begged me
on her death bed.

01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:12.070
Why bring up my mother now?

01:32:16.290 --> 01:32:18.900
Don't worry. Go to Shanghai
and track down Yem.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.160
I'll follow tomorrow.

01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:31.440
News bulletin. Today at 10:07...

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:57.870
Some guy shot me yesterday.

01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:02.710
Somethings gone wrong.
-Let me borrow the car.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.510
If we leave now for lncheon,
you can take the boat.

01:33:05.610 --> 01:33:08.310
I'm in this to the end.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.880
Forget the operation.
Not in your condition.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.890
It's not about my condition.

01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:20.360
I'm a Military School graduate.

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:26.760
Get me my Thompson and
the bombs Duk-sam left.

01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:28.690
And close the cafe tomorrow,
you stay out of sight.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Miss!

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.970
What are you doing
at this hour?

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.060
You'll be married soon.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.800
You mustn't stay up.

01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:10.910
Get a good night's sleep.

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:15.010
I will.

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:21.320
Oh, and I found the girl
who looks just like you.

01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:23.090
Her name's Ahn Okyun.

01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:26.390
She ordered glasses
at the department store.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.460
Really?

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:30.860
Miss?

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.400
Aren't you curious to hear more?

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.980
Why are you here
instead of Mitsuko?

01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:00.380
Operator!
Central Police Station.

01:36:17.970 --> 01:36:19.870
Hello?

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.480
Miss!
Mr. Kawaguchi has arrived.

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:47.000
Tanaka!
-How do you do?

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:48.600
Have a seat.

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:52.800
Where is the butler?
-Haven't seen him all morning.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.440
A cup of tea?
-Thank you.

01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:19.300
I'm Mitsuko.

01:37:35.210 --> 01:37:36.450
Mitsuko.

01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:41.750
You have a guest?

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.020
Tanaka, from Shanghai.
This is my fiancee.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.360
Nice to meet you.

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.690
What brings him here today?

01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:54.800
He'll be a guard
at the wedding...

01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:57.170
...postponing his trip
to Shanghai.

01:37:59.030 --> 01:38:00.030
Shanghai?

01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:04.840
I hear you can get
good coffee there.

01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:07.140
At the Mirabeau?

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.150
Do you know it?

01:38:16.450 --> 01:38:20.820
Do you speak Korean?
-A bit.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:24.360
I get a lot of abuse
for not speaking Korean.

01:38:28.630 --> 01:38:31.170
Why didn't you go to Shanghai?
-To kill that punk.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.020
What about you?

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.310
Where's the girl
who should be here?

01:38:37.810 --> 01:38:38.810
Dead.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:41.510
Killed by Kang,
who thought it was me.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:46.050
Go back to Shanghai,
this is my job.

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:48.020
What will you do?

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.050
I can go to the wedding.

01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:54.020
Since I'm the bride.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Aren't you scared?

01:39:12.010 --> 01:39:13.010
I am.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:15.340
Let's speak Japanese.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.950
Here's your invitation.

01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:21.850
How's my wife-to-be?

01:39:23.020 --> 01:39:26.220
She's so beautiful.
I wish her happiness.

01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:29.860
Seems like Mr. Tanaka
cannot make it tomorrow.

01:39:30.190 --> 01:39:31.390
That's true, but...

01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:39.870
...since it's an important day
for Mitsuko...

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.600
...I'll make time.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:43.970
See you tomorrow.

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:52.280
For his esteemed service
to the Great Japanese Empire...

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:55.990
...Yem Sek-jin is named Investigator
for the Secret Service.

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:58.190
November 8, 1933.

01:39:58.450 --> 01:40:00.920
Chief of Military Police.

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.400
Did you find out?

01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:11.830
The Wedding's at the department
store, tomorrow at noon.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.510
The store will be open
but the 2nd floor closed off.

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:19.780
Wait.
Don't hang up.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.490
We haven't opened yet,
what is it?

01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:39.130
So here's the famous Gyeongseong
bureau of the Provisional Government.

01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:43.300
I heard there were 3 bureaus.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.500
Where are the other two?

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.760
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:56.850
Come with us
to the police station.

01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.020
Wait.

01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:06.960
Can I get my overcoat?

01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:25.410
Good luck and be careful.

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:30.280
It seems this is goodbye.

01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:40.450
Congratulations.

01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:42.120
Thank you.

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.320
Congratulations, Mr. Kang.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:51.560
I wish the Governor-General
could be here.

01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:57.300
He must be very busy?

01:42:57.670 --> 01:42:59.470
He had to go to Japan.

01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:16.820
The Governor-General. He should have come.

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.980
Please leave your gun with us.

01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:27.500
I've come as
Kawaguchi's special guard.

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.430
2nd Lt. Tanaka?

01:43:31.170 --> 01:43:32.170
This way.

01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:49.790
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:55.320
I'll read a message from
Governor-General Ugaki.

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.530
"Kawaguchi Shunsuke
and Mitsuko...

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.930
...I congratulate you
on your wedding.

01:44:02.230 --> 01:44:05.670
Congratulations
to Commander Kawaguchi...

01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:10.870
...and Mr. Kang In-guk.

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:16.410
Marriage is a new beginning.

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:21.020
May you both rely
on each other..."

01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:31.390
Get my clothes.

01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:33.830
MY gun!

01:44:39.170 --> 01:44:43.040
Follow me!
-Enter the groom!

01:44:54.620 --> 01:45:00.960
Why are you here?

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.530
Why has an independence
fighter come here?

01:45:04.990 --> 01:45:05.990
I told you.

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.200
If you fail, it won't end
with you returning the money.

01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:11.730
Take him to the head office.

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:46.100
Are you nervous?

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.540
What are you thinking, Mitsuko?

01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:52.270
Why'd you kill
my sister from Manchuria?

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:59.410
Enter the bride!

01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:28.110
The couple's fathers
will now bow to each other.

01:49:02.630 --> 01:49:03.770
Who are you?

01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:13.980
What are you doing?

01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:43.440
A bomb!
Fall back!

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:44.610
How many are there?
-One man with a machine gun.

01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:45.910
Up the main staircase!

01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:52.380
Operator!
Connect me to the police!

01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:30.550
Comrade Chu Sang-om!

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:39.560
Captain Yem?
-Big Gun!

01:51:12.330 --> 01:51:14.100
Headquarters!
Send reinforcements!

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.250
Who are you?

01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:25.870
Captain!

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:14.420
Where's my daughter Mitsuko?

01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:17.550
You killed her.

01:53:17.890 --> 01:53:22.560
With those hands. My mother too.

01:53:24.630 --> 01:53:27.700
I'm sorry.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.700
It was to protect our family.

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.500
There's no more family now.

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:39.410
It was for our people.

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:45.110
The ignorant Korean people
needed to eat.

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:51.090
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:56.830
Sorry.

01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:20.380
The Patricidal Club,
you know what happened to them?

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:26.250
Some were caught,
some committed suicide.

01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:30.460
And some cowards like me
became contractors in Shanghai.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:34.300
I don't want you to live
with that burden.

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.160
Go back.

01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:39.930
To the 3rd Unit,
Korea Independence Army.

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:48.810
Let's leave first.

01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:53.720
You're coming with us.

01:54:58.290 --> 01:55:01.560
Comrade Big Gun!
-Captain!

01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:04.760
The operation's a success?

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:10.900
Yes.

01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:19.310
You look pretty in that.

01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:25.510
Go, I'll see you downstairs.

01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:30.620
Go on.

01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.890
Are you the woman Mitsuko saw?

01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:08.460
One more word and you die.

01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:10.330
Okay-

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:22.600
The Commander is dead!
-Mr. Kang too!

01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:30.650
Kawaguchi, Mitsuko,
are you okay?

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:32.680
Yes.
- I'll take them.

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.120
Hurry to the hospital.

01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:45.760
The bride and groom
have been kidnapped!

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:47.400
There!

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.600
Don't shoot!
There are hostages!

01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.790
Don't shoot,
the Commander's son is a hostage.

01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:14.020
We surrounded them first.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.640
Sir! I'm a bit late.
Please get in.

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:36.740
You really are something.

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:42.680
Don't shoot!
Stand by!

01:57:43.180 --> 01:57:44.990
Money Girl, good to see you!

01:57:45.190 --> 01:57:46.190
Turn the car around.

01:58:14.650 --> 01:58:18.140
Fire! Emergency! Attack
on the wedding hall.

01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.890
Soldiers, mobilize!

01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:21.920
They're fleeing the wedding hall.

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:24.530
Search for a black car
going towards Myeong-dong.

01:58:25.130 --> 01:58:26.760
There's no way out.

01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:29.000
There's a tunnel in the cafe.
-Let's go.

01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:36.440
Euljiro is blocked.
Both alleys are blocked.

01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:38.270
Heading for Cafe Anemone.

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:50.490
There's a tunnel behind
the wall downstairs.

01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:19.280
Sir, Yem is coming!

01:59:23.650 --> 01:59:25.720
Hey, want to talk?

01:59:25.890 --> 01:59:28.020
Yem is...
- I'll buy us some time.

01:59:33.630 --> 01:59:36.230
You think you're really something?

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:40.030
In the end,
you're just like me.

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.300
Did somebody pay you more?
-No.

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:45.710
I'm not a whore like you.

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:51.510
If you're going to sell out,
get a high price.

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:55.650
Release the hostages first
and come out.

01:59:55.820 --> 01:59:57.120
I'll take care of
everything afterwards.

01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:58.190
One hostage first.

01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:01.190
10 minutes later,
I'll come out with the other.

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:05.560
Run, Yem!
Life is short.

02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:09.060
Right.
Life is short.

02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.610
Find out if there's another
passage from this cafe.

02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:19.610
Yes, sir.

02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:28.780
There's no hope.
Surrender.

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:32.990
Kawaguchi.
What did I tell you before?

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.700
One more word and you die.

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.030
Sorry!

02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:49.340
You go out the front.
I'll take the dirty road with him.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.740
You're Mitsuko.
They think you're a hostage.

02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:56.080
Alone?

02:00:58.310 --> 02:01:00.980
I don't think you'll help
our business, right, Buddy?

02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:04.550
Yeah, we can't get involved
with independence fighters.

02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.560
What are you doing?
Keep hacking.

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.260
Right, we need to go.

02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:12.940
Money Girl!

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:15.300
Don't forget us!

02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:23.140
No!

02:01:24.640 --> 02:01:26.010
Why not?

02:01:26.210 --> 02:01:27.540
We'll meet in Shanghai.

02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.280
At Mirabeau.

02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:33.850
Can we meet again?

02:01:38.690 --> 02:01:39.690
Of course.

02:01:41.790 --> 02:01:44.160
We're husband and wife there.

02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:48.060
Even if I don't know your name.
-My name is...

02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:52.370
...Ahn Okyun.

02:02:11.890 --> 02:02:15.990
Go out and don't look at Yem,
go straight home.

02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.830
We'll send out
the other hostage in 10 mins.

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:38.880
Buddy!
I'll do it.

02:02:53.530 --> 02:02:54.600
Here, get in.

02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:05.840
We need to break in even if it can
hurt Kawaguchi. Get in. Yes, sir!

02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:09.780
The district office says there's a passage
in there leading to Cheonggye stream.

02:03:11.010 --> 02:03:12.680
Let's go to Cheonggye stream.

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:17.820
Kawaguchi is dead!

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:30.330
Can't they wait 10 mins?

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.400
We should visit Hawaii
before we die, right?

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.240
Of course. Women there walk
around with their clothes off.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:38.610
Really? Why?
-Because it's hot.

02:03:38.970 --> 02:03:40.670
Because it's hot.

02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:43.080
Sounds like paradise.

02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:46.180
No Japanese army.
Women with no clothes.

02:03:46.180 --> 02:04:00.430
Sorry Buddy,
I should have listened to you.

02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:03.530
Actually, I want to keep mine too.

02:04:05.670 --> 02:04:07.570
Let's go.
-Okay.

02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:53.730
Today Japan declared its formal

02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:57.940
surrender aboard the USS Missouri.

02:06:58.110 --> 02:06:59.570
The ceremony in Tokyo Bay...

02:06:59.570 --> 02:07:03.480
...was held by the head of
Japan's army and General MacArthur.

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:06.450
Today is Sunday,
September 2, 1945.

02:07:06.450 --> 02:07:08.980
Foreign Minister
Shigemisu Mamoru has arrived.

02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:10.780
There he is.

02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:13.920
He was wounded in an assassination attempt
by Korean patriot Yun Bong-gil in Shanghai.

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:17.260
The Japanese war
of aggression...

02:07:19.930 --> 02:07:24.630
...which inflicted such ghastly damage to the
people of Asia and the world, is finally over.

02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:32.140
Is that the last donation
we received?

02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:35.640
It's been over 10 years.
Money and info about the Governor-General.

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:38.980
I'd like to meet this person.
-Need to know who it is first.

02:07:39.650 --> 02:07:42.520
Why so glum?
It's liberation.

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:48.820
It is liberation.
But so many people died.

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:50.960
Choi Soo-bong,
Na Seok-ju...

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:51.960
“Duk-sam, Chu Sang-ck.

02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:57.400
Stop.
-People will forget them, right?

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:59.570
I'm sorry.

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:07.040
No, it's me who's sorry.

02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:10.280
I'm sorry.

02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:14.350
I am sorry.

02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:37.870
Let's go home!

02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:06.100
September 27, 1949.

02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:13.140
The trial regarding crimes
against the nation will now open.

02:09:14.110 --> 02:09:15.550
Prosecutor, you may speak.

02:09:16.110 --> 02:09:19.810
The defendant is accused...

02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:23.120
...under relevant laws of
acting as a spy...

02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:23.780
...and of committing malign acts
while a member of the police.

02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:27.150
Defendant, state your name,
age and position.

02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:29.520
Age 62, Yem Sek-jin.

02:09:30.090 --> 02:09:33.660
Currently a Republic of Korea policeman.

02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:36.560
What is your personal stance on
the Law of Anti-National Crimes?

02:09:38.230 --> 02:09:40.830
For the sake of history
and social justice...

02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:42.140
...I think it is right.

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.240
But I believe it is a mistake
that I sit here...

02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:51.210
...due to a single
anonymous letter.

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:53.880
What is your basis
for such thoughts?

02:09:54.650 --> 02:09:59.520
Everything I've ever
done was for the sake of liberation.

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:06.110
We call a witness to testify
that Yem informed Japan...

02:10:06.110 --> 02:10:09.830
...of three independence fighters
plotting to assassinate...

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.840
...Kawaguchi Mamoru and
Kang In-guk in 1933.

02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:16.740
Please show in the witness.

02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.680
Just a moment.

02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:34.560
Defendant!
Put out your cigarette.

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.660
Stop smoking you traitor!

02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:46.870
Defendant!
Put on your clothes!

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:49.940
The public will be barred
from further hearings!

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:57.240
Six Japanese bullets
have entered this body.

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:00.591
In 1911,
I was shot during my attack...

02:11:00.603 --> 02:11:03.280
...on the Governor-General.
It left two holes.

02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:05.540
This is from 1922 in Shanghai,
this from 1927 in Khabarovsk.

02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:07.420
1932, the ltsumoho Bombing.

02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:13.730
Next to my heart, 1933!

02:11:14.530 --> 02:11:17.330
You say I sold three comrades...

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.570
...but I chose them myself!

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:26.710
Can you understand
what those youth felt?

02:11:27.810 --> 02:11:30.010
No, you can't!

02:11:30.810 --> 02:11:33.950
Or how I felt,
sending them off!

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:39.520
It was a march
of resistance...

02:11:40.690 --> 02:11:44.160
...in the face of death,
your honour!

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.100
That is all.

02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:58.910
The witness is dead!

02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:18.760
Due to a lack of evidence,
the charges levelled...

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:23.060
...against defendant
Yem Sek-jin...

02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:25.012
...are formally dismissed.

02:12:25.024 --> 02:12:26.900
He gets a 20,000 won fine
for contempt of court.

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.340
Congratulations.

02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:48.490
Attention, salute! Congratulations, sir!

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.760
I will drive you home.

02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:55.360
No, no.
It's a beautiful world.

02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:57.130
I'd like to walk.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.800
Then I'll join you.
-You'll disturb my solitude!

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:04.770
Yes, sir.

02:13:05.940 --> 02:13:06.940
Let's go.

02:13:24.190 --> 02:13:25.690
Hello.

02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:28.930
I'll take this.

02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:32.870
This too.

02:13:42.710 --> 02:13:43.780
Mitsuko?

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:17.540
Myeong Woo?

02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:34.160
Ahn Okyun?

02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:39.400
Why'd you sell your comrades?

02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:43.770
I didn't know.

02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:48.810
I didn't know
we'd be liberated.

02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:52.100
Would I have, if I knew?

02:14:59.190 --> 02:15:00.190
Myung-woo!

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:04.690
My mission from 16 years ago.

02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:08.560
"If Yem is a spy, kill him"

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:12.800
ls now fulfilled.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.330
Say, "Long Live Korea!"

02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:23.170
Long Live Korea!

02:16:26.070 --> 02:16:27.280
Money Girl!

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:29.280
Don't forget us.
