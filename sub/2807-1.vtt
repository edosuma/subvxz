00:02.919 --> 00:06.380
Great. Great.
Just give me a sec to change film.

00:06.673 --> 00:11.468
Okay. I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I am so excited for you.

00:11.761 --> 00:14.471
- Why? What's going on?
- Monica's pregnant.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.143
Oh, my God!
Is that why you guys had to get married?

00:19.352 --> 00:22.771
- Guys, I'm not pregnant!
- Ah, slow swimmers?

00:25.900 --> 00:28.444
What? What do you mean?
You're not pregnant?

00:28.611 --> 00:32.197
- You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
- No.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.241
I'll be right back.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.870
Now why don't we get a shot
of Monica and the bloody soldier?

00:38.079 --> 00:40.998
Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change
before the party.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.000
I can't.
I don't have any other clothes.

00:43.168 --> 00:47.838
Find some. Please! Anything that doesn't say,
"I died tragically in France."

00:48.965 --> 00:52.426
Then why don't we see the bride
and the groom, and the bridesmaids?

00:53.762 --> 00:56.930
Hey, Mon? Why did you tell
the guys that you weren't pregnant?

00:57.098 --> 00:58.182
Because I'm not.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.727
We found your test in the trash.
If you're not pregnant...

01:06.399 --> 01:08.609
...it's because I am.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.987
What are you talking about?

01:12.155 --> 01:15.199
Yes. Ahem. I am with child.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.828
And I didn't wanna say anything
because it's your day.

01:19.996 --> 01:23.415
- I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
- So you told people I was pregnant?

01:24.125 --> 01:26.919
Does this look like a conversation
I wanna remember?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.505
- Who's the father?
- Yeah.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.548
I can't say.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.675
- Why?
- Why not?

01:34.344 --> 01:37.596
I can't say because he's famous.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.182
Oh, my God, who is it?

01:41.976 --> 01:44.103
Come on, you have to tell us.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.689
Okay, okay. It's James Brolin.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.819
James Brolin is the father
of my baby.

01:52.195 --> 01:55.072
As in, Barbra Streisand's husband,
James Brolin?

01:55.782 --> 01:59.701
What? He never said that to me.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.285
Monica, if you can step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.078
How about just the bridesmaids?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.039
I am the groom.
I was told it was kind of a big deal.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.375
- It is.
- Yeah.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.588
- Oh, my God!
- Thank you for doing that.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.715
I just can't deal
with this just quite yet.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.719
- So instead you told me Monica was pregnant?
- You did, I just didn't disagree.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.305
- Sneaky!
- Yeah.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.765
- Smile, ladies!
- Ohh.

03:04.642 --> 03:07.853
- By the way, James Brolin?
- Ugh. I know.

03:08.271 --> 03:12.065
I could only think of two names:
Him and Ed Begley Jr. And then...

03:12.984 --> 03:15.819
I remembered he's gay, so...

03:16.321 --> 03:19.948
- Ed Begley Jr. Is not gay.
- Really?

03:29.792 --> 03:33.462
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

03:33.630 --> 03:35.589
...to introduce to you
for the first time:

03:35.757 --> 03:38.759
Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing!

03:44.265 --> 03:49.186
- Before we go out there, I got a present for you.
- I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.812
- No.
- No?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.981
- I've been taking dancing lessons.
- What?

03:53.191 --> 03:56.735
Yeah, for the last 6 weeks. I wanted this
to be a moment you'd never forget.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.904
Aww. That is so sweet!

03:59.197 --> 04:02.616
So would you care to join me
in our first dance as husband and wife?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.910
- Yes.
- Okay.

04:08.665 --> 04:12.501
- What's the matter?
- These new shoes are all slippery.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.796
- Are you going to be able to do this?
- Not well.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.681
Well, the good news is
I don't think anyone's looking at us.

04:26.724 --> 04:30.894
- So you ready to talk about it?
- No.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.398
Now?

04:35.733 --> 04:37.567
No.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.695
Okay, we'll talk about something else.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.321
- Thank you.
- Who's the father?

04:41.489 --> 04:44.741
Uh. Look, honey,
I haven't told him yet...

04:44.909 --> 04:47.953
...so until I do,
I don't think I should tell anybody else.

04:48.121 --> 04:52.082
Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.667
Ugh. Phoebe!

04:53.835 --> 04:55.752
- Okay. I'm sorry, I'll stop.
- Okay.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.462
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?

04:57.672 --> 05:00.549
- Oh, my God, it's Joey!
- Honey, stop it, okay?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.759
I'm not going to tell you until I tell him.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.804
Ah-ha! At least we know it's a him.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.979
Oh, sweet lord.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.188
I'm sorry, okay?

05:15.398 --> 05:18.734
I went down to the gift shop,
and it was either this or a bathrobe.

05:18.901 --> 05:22.529
Look, what's more important? The way
I'm dressed or me being with you today?

05:22.697 --> 05:26.575
Honey, I'm not even going to pretend
I was listening. Hey! Hey.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.540
Hi.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.669
I'm Ross. I don't believe we've met.
I'm Monica's older brother.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.381
- Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
- Oh.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.885
Hello, "Mona from her restaurant."

05:49.182 --> 05:51.892
Mona. What a beautiful name.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.561
You think so?
I always kind of hated it.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.147
- Aw, come on! Mona Lisa?
- Uh-huh.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.775
Mona...

05:59.984 --> 06:01.610
...Klegglachen?

06:02.904 --> 06:05.238
The famous botanist. Huh?

06:05.448 --> 06:08.867
Oh, no.
She's... Well, she's dead now.

06:09.077 --> 06:13.997
But supposedly she was once
quite the hottie of the plant world.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.707
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:15.875 --> 06:20.587
- Well, see, I never knew about her.
- Linda Klegglachen...

06:24.092 --> 06:26.426
So, what table are you at?

06:27.178 --> 06:29.554
Oh, heh, me too.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.808
Good. There will be someone
who likes my name.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.851
Yes, there will.

06:41.526 --> 06:46.738
Guess what, Molly Gilbert. You've
just been bumped up to table one.

06:46.948 --> 06:51.660
And if it's all right with you,
I'm gonna take your place at table six.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.329
Martin Klegglachen!

06:55.957 --> 07:01.378
That's better. Just bend your arms a little more.
There you go. Look straight ahead.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.339
Now this time I want you
to really put your ass into it.

07:07.510 --> 07:12.848
Chandler, darling. Look, my date has finally
arrived. I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.183
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

07:15.393 --> 07:19.020
Dennis is a dear old friend.
And a fantastic lover.

07:19.230 --> 07:23.233
Bravo, Dennis,
thanks for pleasing my mother so.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.988
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony.
I was stuck at auditions.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.574
Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.034
Hi, I don't believe we've met.
Joey Tribbiani.

07:33.202 --> 07:36.246
- Dennis Phillips.
- Wow. I've admired your work for years.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.914
You've done some amazing stuff.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.334
Thank you.
Excuse me, I'll get myself a drink.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.336
I'll be back in a moment.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.673
Dennis Phillips! That's great!
How did you guys meet?

07:46.841 --> 07:48.508
Well, you know, it's a funny story.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.595
Funny "ha-ha,"
or funny "boom, uh-oh!"

08:00.021 --> 08:04.399
Thank you very much. Now if everyone will
please take their seats, dinner will be served.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.869
Hey.

08:16.120 --> 08:21.333
- Uh, I thought you were at table six.
- Uh, no. Nine.

08:23.211 --> 08:27.964
Ohh. See, before, when you showed it to me,
you held it that way...

08:28.174 --> 08:32.052
...which was misleading.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.472
Well... I'll... um...

08:43.105 --> 08:44.397
Hello.

08:50.947 --> 08:55.200
Chandler! Will you see if your mom can give
my résumé to Dennis Phillips?

08:55.409 --> 08:58.620
Because if I can get into a Broadway show,
I would've done it all:

08:58.788 --> 09:00.121
Film, television and theater.

09:00.289 --> 09:03.583
The only thing left would be radio,
and that's just for ugly people.

09:04.961 --> 09:08.421
- What size shoes do you wear?
- Uh, eleven. Eleven and a half.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.299
Great. My shoes are giving me
a problem on the dance floor.

09:11.467 --> 09:16.972
- Can I borrow the boots from your costume?
- I don't know where I left those, so...

09:17.765 --> 09:21.893
- Those aren't eleven and a half.
- Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

09:22.103 --> 09:26.064
All right, I have surprisingly small feet.
But the rest of me is good! I'll show you!

09:28.985 --> 09:33.613
- Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
- Let's not talk about that now.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.701
- This is so huge.
- Sure, but as big as your wedding?

09:37.910 --> 09:40.161
Of course not. Nothing is.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.914
- Wow. Between me and you?
- Yeah.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.501
In this day and age,
how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

09:46.669 --> 09:50.839
Hey, sometimes you can do everything right,
wear what you're supposed to...

09:51.048 --> 09:53.717
...and one of those little guys
just gets through.

09:54.885 --> 09:58.096
- How?
- I don't know, maybe they have tools.

09:59.473 --> 10:03.018
Well, I talked to her,
and she's definitely gonna have this baby.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.104
She's gonna raise it on her own.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.691
Well, maybe that's really brave.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.527
I just hope she realizes
how hard it's gonna be.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.116
Maybe she hasn't really
thought it through that much.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.369
There's a lot to think about.

10:21.537 --> 10:26.291
How is she gonna handle this financially?
How is she gonna juggle work?

10:27.043 --> 10:31.212
Does she realize she's not gonna have a date
again for the next 18 years?

10:35.217 --> 10:37.093
I don't know.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.472
Are you okay?

10:40.681 --> 10:41.931
Mm-hm.

10:42.308 --> 10:46.686
I'm just thinking about Phoebe.
Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.483
- Champagne?
- Oh, yes. Thank you very much. Whew.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.457
That's actually how the French drink it.

11:13.297 --> 11:17.926
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover,
James Brolin.

11:19.762 --> 11:20.762
- Really?
- Yes.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.264
And apparently,
he is married to some singer.

11:25.309 --> 11:30.271
But he said he'd leave her for me.
So I said, "Are you sure?"

11:30.439 --> 11:33.108
- And James Brolin said...
- Rachel's the one who's pregnant?

11:33.275 --> 11:34.818
What?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.446
Why bother?

11:39.657 --> 11:41.282
How do you feel?

11:41.450 --> 11:43.993
I don't know how I feel.
This is all happening so fast.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.288
I have to make all these decisions
that I don't want to make.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.041
Mm! Oh!
Someone take this away from me!

11:50.501 --> 11:53.795
- Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
- What?

11:54.046 --> 11:58.133
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
I took the test three times.

11:58.342 --> 12:03.012
Yes. Maybe it's a false-positive.
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.306
How many ways are there
to do that?

12:06.267 --> 12:09.561
I'm just saying, don't freak out
until you're 100 percent sure.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.981
I'll take it again at home.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.067
You gotta take it now,
as a present to me.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.028
Okay. Thank you.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.240
- I'll run out and get you one.
- Aw, you girls are so great.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.492
Wait a minute. Who's the father?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.620
- She won't tell us.
- Come on! It's my wedding.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.122
That could be my present.

12:29.290 --> 12:34.002
- Hey! I just gave you peeing on a stick.
- See, this is why you register.

12:40.843 --> 12:45.430
It was the chair again, okay?
I'm not doing it!

12:45.681 --> 12:48.099
It was... Look, I don't.
You know what?

12:52.313 --> 12:54.105
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.524
- Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.067
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.363
- Dr. Geller?
- I wasn't farting!

13:05.701 --> 13:08.536
Uh, a little game from our table.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.332
- Yes?
- Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.542
Oh. Um...

13:15.211 --> 13:18.797
Maybe later.
I'm about to dance with this lady.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.799
Okay.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.134
Ooooh.

13:23.469 --> 13:28.431
Unless this lady wouldn't mind
letting you go first.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.476
I'd be happy to.
You are very sweet.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.729
Ohh. Yes, I am.

13:35.856 --> 13:39.984
In fact, why don't we try it my special way.
You can dance on my feet.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.195
- Sure.
- Yeah? Hop on.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.494
- Is the pretty lady looking?
- Uh-huh.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.913
Keep dancing.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.426
And the world will never know.

14:06.303 --> 14:10.306
- Hey! Did you talk to Dennis?
- Yes. I told him how talented you were.

14:10.516 --> 14:15.603
- I told him all about Days of our Lives.
- No, you don't tell a Broadway guy that!

14:15.771 --> 14:19.941
- Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
- But you're not just a soap actor.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.610
You are a soap actor
with freakishly tiny feet.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.195
Hey.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.582
- Thank you.
- No, thank you, Miranda.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.126
- Melinda.
- All right.

14:38.460 --> 14:43.006
- How cute was that?
- Oh! Were you watching?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.343
- Can I go next?
- Uh...

14:47.553 --> 14:50.221
Of course you can. Hop on.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.725
Okay. But I get to hop on after her.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.401
- I am so gonna score!
- What?

15:03.569 --> 15:05.904
I like your bow.

15:10.993 --> 15:15.538
I'd like to propose a toast
to Monica and Chandler...

15:15.706 --> 15:19.834
...the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.

15:20.336 --> 15:25.131
When I first found out they were
getting married, I was a little angry.

15:25.299 --> 15:29.510
I was like, "Why, God? How can you
take them away from me?!"

15:32.181 --> 15:35.475
But then I thought back over our
memories together.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.477
Some happy memories.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.525
Then there were some sad memories.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.072
I'm sorry.

15:49.740 --> 15:53.284
And some scared memories.
Whoa!

15:55.329 --> 15:56.621
Huh?

15:58.624 --> 16:03.544
And then I realized
I'll always be their friend.

16:03.754 --> 16:07.507
Their friend who can speak
in many dialects...

16:07.716 --> 16:11.469
...has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.723
Oh... To the happy couple.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.359
- That was nice.
- Can we do it again?

16:26.527 --> 16:28.152
No, no.

16:29.071 --> 16:33.074
- So is it my turn?
- I'm next.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.701
Oh!

16:36.453 --> 16:41.082
- That's okay, you can dance with her first.
- Are you sure?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.667
Okay.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.461
- So what's your name?
- Gert.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.588
That's pretty.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.925
Come on.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.261
Whoa! Whoa!

16:54.346 --> 16:56.723
What are you doing, Gert?

16:57.683 --> 17:01.436
Dancing on your feet
like the other girls did it.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.731
Okay.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.775
Hop on, Gert.

17:11.946 --> 17:15.324
- Why aren't you moving your feet?
- I'm trying.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.663
Faster! You're not going fast enough!

17:20.873 --> 17:22.665
Maybe I should stand on your feet!

17:28.088 --> 17:31.632
So did you happen to catch my toast
up there?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.968
Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?

17:34.136 --> 17:36.804
Well, I like to think
there was something for everyone.

17:37.014 --> 17:42.477
- I know you're casting for this new show.
- Look, Joey, I don't think you're right for it.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.897
See, that's where you're wrong.
Whatever it is, I can do it.

17:46.065 --> 17:51.110
- And if you didn't see it up there, just try me.
- It's an all-Chinese cast.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.528
Can you be Chinese?

17:54.656 --> 17:59.285
- I'm not proud of this, but...
- Oh, my God. No, please! Don't!

18:01.663 --> 18:05.500
- Ready to get back on the dance floor?
- Did it turn into sand?

18:05.709 --> 18:10.713
- Come on, I love this song. You'll be fine.
- No, I won't.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.425
Do you know why I took all those lessons?

18:14.593 --> 18:17.261
For the first time, I didn't want you
to be embarrassed...

18:17.429 --> 18:20.515
...to be seen on the dance floor
with some clumsy idiot.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.892
Aww. Sweetie, you could never
embarrass me.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.853
Okay, you could easily embarrass me.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.356
But it doesn't matter. Right?

18:28.524 --> 18:29.982
I married you.

18:30.150 --> 18:34.070
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night
with my husband. Come on!

18:36.031 --> 18:38.699
- Just try not to move your feet at all.
- Oh.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.708
There you go.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.046
- Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
- Why?

18:52.214 --> 18:53.840
You stole my moves.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.221
- How much longer?
- Thirty seconds.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.430
Thirty seconds. Okay.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.724
Did I miss it?

19:08.063 --> 19:11.440
Rachel, I want you to know...

19:11.733 --> 19:14.610
...that if it's positive, we...

19:14.820 --> 19:18.406
- I know. I know.
- You do? Okay.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.243
It's time.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.787
No!

19:27.416 --> 19:31.335
- Go ahead, Rach.
- Oh, wait. You know what? I can't look at it.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.713
I can't look at it.
Somebody else tell me.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.756
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.762
It's negative.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.433
- What?
- It's negative.

19:46.476 --> 19:51.063
Oh.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.776
Well, there you go.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.613
Whew!

20:01.450 --> 20:05.119
That is... That is really great, great news.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.292
Because the whole...

20:12.794 --> 20:17.131
...not being ready,
the financial aspects, all that...

20:19.343 --> 20:23.304
This is so just the way
it was supposed to be.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.143
Well then, great.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.815
God. This is so stupid.

20:37.319 --> 20:41.197
How can I be upset
over something I never had?

20:41.823 --> 20:42.823
It's negative?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.326
No, it's positive.

20:50.832 --> 20:54.335
- What?
- It's not negative, it's positive.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.130
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I lied before.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.590
Oh!

21:01.677 --> 21:03.010
Oh, my God!

21:03.178 --> 21:08.015
- Now you know how you really feel about it.
- Oh! That's a risky little game.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.853
Are you really gonna do this?

21:15.023 --> 21:18.442
Yeah. I'm gonna have a baby.

21:19.695 --> 21:23.197
I'm gonna have a baby!

21:30.330 --> 21:33.874
- With who?
- No, it's still not the time.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.137
I just didn't see
the fast song coming.

21:46.305 --> 21:50.808
Shh. Don't try to talk. We'll get you up to your
room, soak your feet. You'll be okay.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.227
- Oh, thank you.
- That is so sweet!

21:53.395 --> 21:54.812
- Yeah.
- No, I mean it.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.732
There's so few
genuinely nice guys out there.

21:57.899 --> 21:58.983
Tell me about it.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.111
I feel like I'm holding down
the fort all by myself.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.239
- It's Joey, right?
- Yeah.

22:05.407 --> 22:08.909
Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one!

22:09.077 --> 22:12.955
I'm the one that danced
with the kids all night.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.499
How small are your feet?
