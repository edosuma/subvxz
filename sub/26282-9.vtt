WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.420
-Previously on The Resident...
-DEVON: The device industry

00:19.453 --> 00:21.922
needs people like you
to fix a broken system.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.557
If you see something
that's not right,

00:23.591 --> 00:26.927
you will be there
to blow the whistle and fix it.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.429
We manufacture
everything ourselves

00:28.462 --> 00:30.064
right here in Atlanta.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.672
I want a top-notch attorney.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.708
Someone who wears a fancier suit
than you do.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.676
And I get half a million dollars
to make bail

00:42.710 --> 00:44.345
so I can get out
of this rat hole.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.746
PRIYA:
It's our first year of marriage.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.282
Come with me to San Francisco.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.583
I can't leave.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.958
This is crazy,
meeting here today,

00:57.991 --> 00:59.427
the day of your wedding.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.896
I'm not going to San Francisco
with Priya.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.966
-I don't know what I'm doing.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.470
All I know is she took the job,
and I'm staying here.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.639
No. Whatever happens
between you and Priya

01:11.672 --> 01:13.141
has nothing to do with me.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.908
I'm not breaking up
a marriage.

01:14.942 --> 01:17.978
And if you are staying here,
that changes nothing for us,

01:18.011 --> 01:20.948
because I-I'm leaving Atlanta.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.616
What do you mean?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.152
I'm quitting my job.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.719
Why?

01:25.753 --> 01:27.921
Let's just say the medical world
turns out to be

01:27.955 --> 01:29.590
not what I expected.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.891
Hold on a second.
I don't understand.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.226
-I can't talk about it.

01:32.260 --> 01:35.129
I have to meet Gordon Page
for a tour with investors.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.098
Julian...
it can't end like this.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.968
-Yes, it can.
-Wait, wait, don't go.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.105
Everything's falling apart.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.441
For me, too.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.777
Good-bye, Devon.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.022
Wow. You didn't make that,
did you?

02:02.055 --> 02:05.826
If I'm going to be tortured,
I want to look damn good.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.596
-I hate weddings.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.698
-I love them.
-They're all the same.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.966
You know exactly what's going
to happen, and they're long.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.768
So long.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.471
Well, I'm sure
you will cheerfully

02:17.505 --> 02:19.373
suffer your way
through Devon and Priya's.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.709
We got to go. We're gonna be
late for our presentation.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.777
-Wish us luck.
-You're gonna need it.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.279
Bell spending money
to actually help patients,

02:25.313 --> 02:27.215
that's not really his thing.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.185
This is premature.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.856
Or optimistic.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.164
MINA: We only spend
one percent of our revenue

02:44.198 --> 02:46.234
on community services.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.035
That's way below
the four percent required

02:48.068 --> 02:50.170
to maintain our
nonprofit status.

02:50.204 --> 02:53.173
In plain English,
Chastain gets 20.6 million

02:53.207 --> 02:54.475
every year from Uncle Sam.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.709
MINA:
And in return, we do nothing

02:55.743 --> 02:57.411
to justify our tax break.

02:57.445 --> 03:00.047
So you're proposing the board
fund a free clinic

03:00.080 --> 03:02.983
for the uninsured
and establish it here,

03:03.016 --> 03:05.085
right across the street
from our ER.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.388
The proximity to Chastain
could be a huge advantage.

03:07.421 --> 03:10.358
We could defer patients who
can't pay their hospital bills

03:10.391 --> 03:12.926
to the clinic, where we can
give them better care.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.995
How much is the rent
on this space?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.864
The city owns the building,
and has agreed

03:16.897 --> 03:19.733
-to let us use it for free.
-You've been busy.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.371
You okay?

03:23.404 --> 03:25.339
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.341
Well, it's a lovely idea,
but so far,

03:27.375 --> 03:28.876
it's all just pie in the sky.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.011
When am I gonna see
some real numbers?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.380
Who's gonna staff it?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.714
Volunteers from Chastain,

03:33.747 --> 03:35.182
medical students
and retired nurses.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.217
Not everything's free.
We will have to hire

03:37.251 --> 03:39.086
a top primary-care physician.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.689
Sounds like a... a win-win.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.529
Call 911.
Let's just get him to the ER.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.230
Marshall,
tell me where it hurts.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.136
*

04:05.513 --> 04:08.916
He's been getting steadily
weaker these past few months.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.584
I'm old. It's normal.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.753
65 isn't old. It's the new 40.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.956
We know what's wrong,
but this...

04:15.989 --> 04:18.225
this is what gave me
a tentative diagnosis.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.661
Listen.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.434
I still have a heartbeat.
That's reassuring.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.736
Daddy, be serious.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.404
You have a loud heart murmur.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.239
An echocardiogram confirmed
that he has

04:32.272 --> 04:33.507
severe aortic stenosis.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.676
His aortic valve
is so tightly narrowed

04:35.709 --> 04:38.245
that the blood has a hard time
leaving the heart,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.147
robbing the rest of the body
of oxygen-rich blood.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.583
Which is why I'm so darned tired
and out of breath.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.185
I'm gonna bring in
our best surgeon,

04:45.218 --> 04:46.987
Dr. AJ Austin,

04:47.020 --> 04:48.456
and he's going to explain
the options

04:48.489 --> 04:51.091
of valve-replacement surgery.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.126
He's got a great beard, too.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.962
Well, how long will this take?

04:54.995 --> 04:57.865
-I got to get to Nicaragua.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.200
Another one of his
Habitat for Humanity projects.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.203
I'm retired, returning
to my first love, carpentry.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.473
Well, you can expect to stay in
the hospital for about a week.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.375
Full recovery may take a while,
but you are young,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.677
and you're in good health, okay?

05:09.710 --> 05:13.013
So let's admit you,
get you fixed up.

05:13.046 --> 05:16.016
Nicaragua's waiting.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.289
Dr. Hawkins, can I have a word?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.157
Of course. What's wrong?

05:24.191 --> 05:27.194
Look, I lost my mom
when I was born.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.130
It's always just been
the two of us.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.032
And now my dad is helping
to raise my son,

05:32.065 --> 05:34.368
who just adores him, and...
and, look, I get it.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.804
All hospitals are dangerous and
surgeries have their risks...

05:36.837 --> 05:38.706
I'll keep an eye out for him.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.908
Thank you.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.245
-All right.
-Yeah.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.550
Hey.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.585
Amazing man.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.721
-Okay.
-So warm with his daughter.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.255
I wish he were my father.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.324
Well, right now
your real father needs you.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.492
He's coming into the ER.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.401
I want transport
to Atlanta General.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.903
-My regular doctor is there.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.605
Our chairman of the board
won't be treated

06:11.639 --> 06:13.106
in his own hospital?
Come on.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.743
All right, BP's 105/80,
pulse is 110.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.344
Put him in bay ten.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.713
MARSHALL: I already have
a team of doctors working...

06:19.747 --> 06:22.516
We need a diagnosis before we
transport you anywhere.

06:22.550 --> 06:26.053
I know exactly what this is.
I have Crohn's.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.922
I've had it for 20 years.
I know how to manage it.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.291
Doesn't look that way.
Why didn't you tell me?

06:31.324 --> 06:34.227
-Uh, wild guess,

06:34.261 --> 06:36.229
-because I'm a doctor.
-It's under control.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.798
Every once in a while,
it flares up,

06:37.831 --> 06:39.232
and this is one of those days.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.300
One, two, three.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.303
NIC: Crohn's can have
dangerous complications,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.739
so let's get you up
to the VIP wing.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.075
We'll get your records and
tag in your gastroenterologist.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.443
-Excellent idea.
-Our VIP wing

06:49.477 --> 06:51.078
is nicer
and far better equipped

06:51.111 --> 06:52.713
than Atlanta General's.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.981
They're ganging up on me.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.716
They're trying
to take care of you.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.317
Feldman, keep me posted.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.953
I'll make arrangements
to admit you.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.759
-He doesn't tell me anything.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.728
He's impossible.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.963
Mm, flashing back to that time
you sprained your ankle

07:09.997 --> 07:12.065
and wouldn't let
anyone help you.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.602
I was nothing like that.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.437
A father and son
who refuse to be treated.

07:17.471 --> 07:21.975
I'd say the apple falls
directly under the tree.

07:22.009 --> 07:26.079
Listen, Todd, you, me,
Paris, this New Year's.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.448
It's gonna be insane.
We'll go clubbing.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.918
We'll just have a really good...
I got to go.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.654
Hey, uh, you had three
incoming calls, two from...

07:33.687 --> 07:35.789
I can find it. I wrote it down.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.257
It's somewhere right here.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.325
God, help me.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.360
Um, I know one was from Roberta,

07:40.393 --> 07:42.496
uh, from that lab place
with the initials.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.998
They all have initials.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.000
Do you have
a learning disability?

07:47.034 --> 07:48.702
Um, and your lawyer,
McMullins...

07:48.736 --> 07:50.938
-McCrary.
-Mc-McCrary.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.373
Uh, he is in your office.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.476
-Hold my calls.
-Actually, wait, hold on.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.878
He seems a tad sleazy to me.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.346
Maybe you should have my dad
hook you up

07:59.379 --> 08:01.014
with one of his lawyers.

08:01.048 --> 08:04.217
This deposition you gave
Lane Hunter's lawyers,

08:04.251 --> 08:05.719
you should have called me.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.387
LAWYER :
Dr. Hunter is charged with

08:07.420 --> 08:08.989
the death of Lily Kendall.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.224
How long were you
and my client lovers?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.496
BELL :
Um, I was not in love with her.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.799
LAWYER: She says you slept
with her many times.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.201
Uh, a-a-a few times.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.503
Not many.

08:23.537 --> 08:26.173
How many times is "many"?

08:26.206 --> 08:29.176
What are you not telling me?

08:29.209 --> 08:31.745
There's some kind of sex tape.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.982
In the legal world,
there's a term for this.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.717
It's called a disaster.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.852
This woman is as popular
as Hitler,

08:38.886 --> 08:40.588
and the fact that you were
with her between the sheets

08:40.621 --> 08:42.756
is gonna make
people's skin crawl.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.725
You'll be fired.
Your reputation will be...

08:44.758 --> 08:45.926
Look, enough.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.828
This is how I get out of it.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.830
I'm all ears.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.332
I've agreed to post her bail
and help her find a good lawyer.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.168
-Seriously, you're just
digging a deeper hole.
-Hear me out.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.904
She could get off.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.940
There's a doctor in Texas
who raped his patients,

08:59.973 --> 09:02.676
just got off with a slap
on the wrist, no jail time.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.212
Kept his license.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.116
They're gonna paint her
as aggressive,

09:09.149 --> 09:10.751
not criminal.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.020
Dr. Hunter saved
hundreds of lives.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.690
And if she gets off,
then any lingering sense

09:16.724 --> 09:19.026
that Chastain is to blame
goes away, too.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.427
Everyone's exonerated.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.130
Dr. Hunter's bail is set
at five million dollars.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.465
Ten percent of which
they'll need in cash.

09:25.498 --> 09:26.867
You don't get that back.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.602
That's what
the bail bondsman charges.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.537
Well, she'll pay me back.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.140
-She has money
in offshore accounts.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.108
Look, it's the least
of my worries.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.178
I'd pay half a million dollars
to make this go away.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.653
GORDON:
Welcome to QuoVadis.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.888
We are very excited
to give you the first

09:47.921 --> 09:49.890
exclusive tour.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.092
Now, a little housekeeping
before we proceed.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.227
NDAs have to be signed.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.263
We guard our trade secrets
with our lives.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.331
I think you can trust
a four-star general.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.934
Well, as Ronald Reagan said,
"Trust, but verify."

10:00.968 --> 10:03.136
How's the VNS pilot going
at Chastain?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.838
So far, so good.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.641
We just cured
intractable seizures

10:07.675 --> 10:09.409
in an eight-year-old boy.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.511
It's the kind of story
we live for.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.014
DARPA is very interested
in VNS devices

10:14.047 --> 10:15.816
for brain stimulation and more.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.284
Yeah, it's a great market.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.252
I was an early investor
in two tech giants,

10:19.286 --> 10:20.954
and even they weren't
this paranoid.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.792
Well, trust me,
our technology is worth it.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.862
You understand that,
for military contracts,

10:28.896 --> 10:31.699
all products must, by law,
be made in the United States?

10:31.732 --> 10:34.334
All QuoVadis devices are
manufactured at our facility

10:34.367 --> 10:35.769
here in Georgia.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.205
This is where we design
all our prototypes.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.873
This is where we do
all our testing.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.976
From start to finish,
made in the USA.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.023
Our engineering is unrivaled,

10:56.056 --> 10:58.058
and our patient outcomes
show it.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.993
But if that doesn't
convince you,

11:00.027 --> 11:02.029
then how does
a thousand percent return

11:02.062 --> 11:04.231
on your investment sound?

11:04.264 --> 11:06.666
By the end of this year,
we are projecting revenues

11:06.700 --> 11:08.468
of 50 million.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.005
Next year,
after we go nationwide:

11:12.039 --> 11:13.573
500 million.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.408
In three years...

11:16.777 --> 11:18.779
...five billion.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.420
-Better.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.023
He's on hydromorphone for pain.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.860
Doesn't seem so intimidating
just lying there, does he?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.694
I can hear you.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.365
Well, keep me updated
on his condition.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.168
I want his ins and outs.
Complete breakdown.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.536
Urine, stool, the works.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.907
No secrets between a doctor
and a patient, right?

11:46.940 --> 11:49.709
You're not actually his doctor.
Dr. Simmons is.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.278
Dad, this is
the chief of Chastain's

11:51.311 --> 11:52.913
gastroenterology department.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.415
She's a leading expert
in Crohn's disease.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.684
-SIMMONS: Dr. Bell.
-Irena.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.386
-Thanks for joining.
-Mr. Winthrop,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.922
I have spoken to your team
over at Atlanta General.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.456
They sent over all
of your records, and I think

12:03.490 --> 12:04.892
I have a pretty good
lay of the land.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.726
So now I just want
to run some blood work,

12:06.760 --> 12:08.361
check for inflammatory markers.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.463
But, once you're stable,
if you do still want

12:10.497 --> 12:12.065
to be transferred over
to Atlanta General,

12:12.099 --> 12:14.234
-we can arrange that.
-Thanks.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.668
Feel like a helicopter ride?

12:16.904 --> 12:18.571
Your insurance will pay.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.140
MARSHALL:
I think I'm good here,

12:20.173 --> 12:21.541
-thank you.
-CONRAD: We've started you

12:21.574 --> 12:23.210
on IV fluids, and we'll need
to put an NG tube in

12:23.243 --> 12:25.245
-to help decompress
your abdomen.
-Yeah, that should

12:25.278 --> 12:26.814
get you feeling better
so you can get some rest.

12:26.847 --> 12:30.650
Thank you all.
I'm sorry to be a bother.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.854
If we're done here,
I want to talk to Conrad.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.024
Alone.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.692
Of course.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.830
CONRAD:
Thank you.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.635
Talk to him like you talk
to all of your patients.

12:59.712 --> 13:03.316
-Mm, better.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.753
I've been dealing with this
for 20 years.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.957
It started shortly
after your mom left me.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.658
Okay, wait.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.294
Mom didn't leave you.
You left her.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.765
Well, that's irrelevant
at the moment, isn't it?

13:18.798 --> 13:22.269
Yes. It is.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.471
Go ahead.
What were you gonna say?

13:24.504 --> 13:28.876
Look, Conrad,
thank you for your help.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.311
Now let Dr. Simmons take over.

13:31.344 --> 13:35.448
I came back here
to get to know my son,

13:35.482 --> 13:39.552
fully aware of the things
that stood between us.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.989
And I think we've made
real progress

13:42.022 --> 13:44.491
in leaving the past behind.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.460
So let's not endanger that.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.062
Okay, fine.

13:49.096 --> 13:52.900
Whatever happens,
I can't be a burden.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.369
It's not my style.

13:56.403 --> 14:01.308
You do not
have to take care of me.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.344
This is what I do, Dad.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.330
You okay?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.532
Yeah. I'm good.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.869
Are these meant
to be form

14:29.903 --> 14:32.605
-I don't want to look fat.
-You wear scrubs.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.741
Horrible green scrubs,
like, every day.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.576
Exactly. Hello, Mrs. Pravesh.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.645
:
Hello.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.884
IRVING:
You look lovely today.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.220
Thank you.
Yes, I do look smashing.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.789
-But all eyes will be

14:49.822 --> 14:52.059
on the happy couple.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.094
I'm so proud of you.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.530
I'll try to keep it that way.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.466
What does that mean?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.901
Nothing.

15:01.935 --> 15:05.772
-Nothing, Ma.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.608
Go. Go, go, go. Let us finish
getting dressed, okay?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.046
See you in a bit.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.281
Yes. Bye-bye. See you.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.719
He's thinking about screaming
kids, mortgage payments,

15:19.752 --> 15:22.455
the dad bod.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.723
It's a wedding,
not a funeral, dude.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.924
Dad bod is inevitable.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.160
-Thank you, guys.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.496
Yes. Yes. Excellent.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.065
Yes, we will.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.634
Another two commitments,
each for 25 million.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.070
I'm happy for you, Gordon.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.271
The lab is incredibly
impressive.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.739
You are a great salesman.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.674
You should celebrate.
Take the afternoon off.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.011
I wouldn't know
what to do with myself.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.645
Personal trainer
is waiting in the gym

15:45.678 --> 15:48.015
for my lunchtime workout.
I'll be back in an hour.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.084
There are great things on the
horizon, Julian, for both of us.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.253
You picked the perfect
VNS patient.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.288
And I will reward you.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.792
*

16:25.218 --> 16:27.187
Hi.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.023
Julian Booth, sales. Mr. Page
left his phone in the lab.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.025
I'm just gonna go in
and get it for him.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.736
Hey. I was just looking
for Gordon Page's phone.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.706
Okay, no worries.
Um, if you find it,

16:46.739 --> 16:49.076
just bring it
to the office, okay?

16:59.419 --> 17:00.920
It's called a TAVR.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.589
We snake a catheter

17:02.622 --> 17:04.257
through an artery in your groin,

17:04.291 --> 17:06.159
and we replace the valve
in your heart

17:06.193 --> 17:08.161
without ever cutting
into your chest.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.097
Is... is that as simple
as it sounds?

17:10.130 --> 17:12.532
Well, I've only done a few
hundred TAVRs in my career,

17:12.565 --> 17:15.768
and every single one of them
have gone off without a hitch.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.271
Now, I have an opening,
and I can schedule it

17:18.305 --> 17:20.407
this afternoon,
once your pre-op tests come in.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.942
I could even fit in
nine holes of golf,

17:22.975 --> 17:24.577
if I played golf, which I don't.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.013
Wait, this
That is so soon.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.382
I mean, I have so many
questions. What are the risks?

17:29.416 --> 17:31.218
How long will he have
to stay in the hospital?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.752
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow your roll.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.687
Every surgery has
its share of risks,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.923
especially for
an older gentleman.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.025
: Oh, watch yourself.
-However,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.594
for a mature,
well-seasoned adult,

17:41.628 --> 17:43.796
and in such good physical
condition as yourself,

17:43.830 --> 17:46.099
the risks will be minimal.

17:48.301 --> 17:52.272
Well, let's get this over with.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.274
Nicaragua awaits.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.042
Those houses won't
build themselves.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.445
-Very wise man there.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.782
CONRAD:
There.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.984
Ah, it's a stricture

18:05.017 --> 18:07.387
in the area of your father's
last anastomosis.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.222
It's probably been there
a while.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.491
If it gets any worse, he's gonna
be completely obstructed.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.326
Yes, I'm gonna recommend

18:13.360 --> 18:16.463
that we schedule surgery
sometime in the next few days.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.897
Why so fast?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.466
If it gets
completely obstructed,

18:19.499 --> 18:21.468
it could compromise blood flow
to the intestine.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.969
I would trust
Dr. Simmons and Conrad.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.904
SIMMONS: Once the blood flow
is compromised,

18:24.937 --> 18:26.906
the intestine may perforate,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.576
-and then you would be septic.
-That's life-threatening.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.344
MARSHALL:
When would you do it?

18:31.378 --> 18:34.414
How long is the rehab, and what
are the risks of the surgery?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.684
Well, all surgeries have risks.
But this one we do routinely.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.320
And I'd recommend you have it
done sooner rather than later.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.489
Tomorrow. That would be best.

18:42.522 --> 18:45.124
That way, we can do
some pre-op testing,

18:45.158 --> 18:47.360
book an OR
and line up a top surgeon.

18:47.394 --> 18:48.995
Anybody but Bell.

18:49.028 --> 18:50.997
He'd be at the bottom
of my list.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.465
See, isn't it great
having a doctor

18:52.499 --> 18:53.666
in the family, Mr. Winthrop?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.368
Looks like I'm in your hands,

18:55.402 --> 18:58.838
-and I will do whatever you say.
-Tomorrow it is.

18:58.871 --> 19:02.141
Okay. I'll book an OR and check
the general surgeon's schedule.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.711
Now, there is one more issue.
I have all of my patients

19:04.744 --> 19:07.347
fill out a health care proxy
and a medical directive.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.017
This is not to say I expect
you will need it. I do not.

19:11.050 --> 19:14.053
-But even I have one.
-It's standard of care, also.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.556
If there's anything
I've learned at Chastain,

19:16.589 --> 19:18.791
it's that there are
no guarantees.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.661
If I'm incapacitated,

19:21.694 --> 19:24.531
my son has my medical power
of attorney.

19:24.564 --> 19:28.535
I trust him to make any
decisions that need to be made.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.738
There must be someone closer
to him than me

19:31.771 --> 19:33.240
to make those decisions.
We're making progress,

19:33.273 --> 19:34.641
but there's a 20-year gap.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.543
He doesn't have anyone but you.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.678
That's kind of a testimony
to how he's lived his life.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.913
Here he is, sick.
No one's visiting.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.915
I don't want
this responsibility.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.218
Rose never leaves
her father's side.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.953
They finish
each other's sentences.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.390
I barely know my father.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.659
Well, maybe you should fix that.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.570
Gordon here. What's up?

20:03.603 --> 20:04.871
BELL:
It's me, Randolph.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.006
I have a favor to ask.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.908
I love doing favors.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.880
I need money. A fair amount.

20:13.913 --> 20:18.184
Huh. Well, I could
let you in on the IPO.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.919
Those shares
will be worth millions.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.788
That could take six months.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.291
You need it fast.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.527
How about a position
on the board of directors?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.196
It's salaried, of course.
The figure is generous.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.631
Well, how much
are we talking about?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.065
How much do you need?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.870
Half a million.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.872
Ooh, that is steep.

20:39.906 --> 20:43.943
But easily handled. I can
advance you the cash right away,

20:43.976 --> 20:47.880
and we'll find
a quid pro quo later.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.550
There are so many ways
for a high-profile doctor

20:50.583 --> 20:52.852
to help QuoVadis.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.423
I have one job today, and that's

20:56.456 --> 20:58.124
to get you
to the church on time.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.560
The venue is downstairs
in the hotel.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.496
I think we'll make it.
And you have two jobs.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.965
Hmm? Right. The rings.

21:08.668 --> 21:12.939
Oh, my God.
Oh, where are they?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.941
I heard a ding
when I got out of my car.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.843
I thought I dropped a penny
in the sewer, but...

21:16.876 --> 21:18.945
Stop it.

21:20.179 --> 21:22.181
You.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.186
You know,
the funny thing is that

21:27.219 --> 21:28.455
you actually thought
that was funny.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.457
Is losing your sense
of humor part of

21:30.490 --> 21:32.091
the marriage vows?

21:32.124 --> 21:34.361
Look, man, are you okay?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.763
Because you don't seem okay.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.299
And I'm here to talk
and listen if you want to talk.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.869
I also have a getaway car ready.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.441
-Hi, Mom.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.843
May I have a word?

21:54.914 --> 21:57.784
I'll be by the elevators,
pacing.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.890
Big day, huh?

22:03.923 --> 22:06.325
-A little.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.195
Thank you.

22:10.262 --> 22:12.499
I remember my wedding day.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.701
You know it was
an arranged marriage, right?

22:14.734 --> 22:16.669
And yet it worked out.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.705
Yes, it did.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.573
Eventually.

22:21.608 --> 22:23.342
It was not easy.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.145
I was trapped in the beginning.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.681
It was not love at first sight.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.718
And, Devon...

22:31.751 --> 22:36.222
there was somebody else
in my life.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.157
But I was a good girl.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.027
I did everything
my parents told me to do.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.895
So I broke it off
with this young man

22:42.929 --> 22:45.732
because I knew
that they didn't approve.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.835
Mom, if there's something
that you want to tell me,

22:48.868 --> 22:51.237
just say it.

22:51.270 --> 22:53.706
It has taken me a long time

22:53.740 --> 22:56.075
to accept my fate.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.377
I would lie awake
in bed at night

22:58.411 --> 23:00.880
thinking about
that other young boy.

23:02.114 --> 23:05.418
What was he doing?
Does he miss me?

23:05.452 --> 23:09.355
I even thought of contacting him
so many times.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.592
-Yes.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.463
I'm happy now, Devon.
I've come to love your father.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.965
He's a good man.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.900
But this is

23:20.933 --> 23:22.869
and this will always be

23:22.902 --> 23:25.371
your decision.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.942
I want you to marry the woman
who has your heart.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.913
Okay? Okay.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.623
I hope it's Priya.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.625
But, Devon, if it's not,

23:45.658 --> 23:48.961
don't do this for me
or for your father

23:48.995 --> 23:51.898
or for anyone else.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.433
We just want you to be happy.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.436
Okay?

24:05.678 --> 24:08.414
Mark Truscott, FDA, product
regulation, Atlanta division.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.782
JULIAN:
I'm a high-level

24:09.816 --> 24:11.518
device rep for QuoVadis Labs.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.085
I know the company.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.788
I believe that my firm...

24:15.822 --> 24:17.757
I know that my firm

24:17.790 --> 24:20.126
is engaged
in a wide-ranging fraud.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.929
Uh, do you have proof?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.497
I can get it. I signed
a nondisclosure agreement

24:24.531 --> 24:26.365
when I was hired,

24:26.398 --> 24:28.868
so I would need whistleblower
status to give you my name.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.837
-I can arrange that.
-And I want

24:30.870 --> 24:33.673
the assurance that you'd
investigate immediately.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.775
Lives are at stake,
and I feel sick at what

24:35.808 --> 24:37.844
-I might have been a part of.

24:37.877 --> 24:41.548
-I am.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.150
I-I need details
to arrange all this.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.818
We close soon,
but I could meet you

24:45.852 --> 24:48.487
outside of the office.
I live in Decatur.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.156
Do you know Glenlake Park?

24:50.189 --> 24:53.025
-I can find it.
-4:30 in the north parking lot.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.326
And from this moment on,

24:54.360 --> 24:55.728
you must keep everything
confidential.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.830
Don't talk to anyone
but the FDA.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.533
-I don't plan on it.
-I'll see you shortly.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.475
McCRARY:
You realize

25:09.508 --> 25:10.677
these QuoVadis terms put you

25:10.710 --> 25:12.311
in a very
uncomfortable position.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.881
I realize it gets me the money
to make Lane's bail,

25:14.914 --> 25:17.016
which makes the sex tape
go away.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.018
You think she'll hold up
her end of the bargain?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.588
What choice do I have?

25:21.621 --> 25:24.891
The cash they're giving you
to be on the board of directors

25:24.924 --> 25:27.660
is listed as an advance
against future stock earnings.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.395
If the QuoVadis IPO goes south

25:29.428 --> 25:32.665
or doesn't happen at all, you're
on the hook for a lot of money.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.333
The QuoVadis IPO
is a no-brainer.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.068
In five years, they'll be
the biggest device company

25:36.102 --> 25:38.671
-in the country. Next.
-This agreement gives QuoVadis

25:38.705 --> 25:41.674
unlimited rights to your image
or likeness across all forms

25:41.708 --> 25:43.743
of marketing, in perpetuity.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.012
TV ads, billboards, pamphlets.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.446
You sure you want
your name linked

25:47.479 --> 25:49.916
with QuoVadis
until the sun burns out?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.517
Well, forget about
the sun burning out.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.686
My image is gonna be
in the toilet by the weekend

25:53.720 --> 25:55.054
if we don't do something.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.589
Look, I just want to make sure

25:56.623 --> 25:58.925
you did your due diligence
on this Gordon Page guy.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.392
-How can you know...
-You know who else

26:00.426 --> 26:03.429
is serving on the board with me?
Two senators,

26:03.462 --> 26:05.698
the governor of North Carolina,
a former Secretary of Defense,

26:05.732 --> 26:07.033
and an astronaut.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.435
Guy went into space.

26:09.468 --> 26:13.439
Do any of them know jack
about medical devices?

26:17.009 --> 26:19.879
AUSTIN:
Dr. Okafor, your opinion

26:19.912 --> 26:21.280
on the progress of the catheter?

26:21.313 --> 26:23.149
Slow.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.717
AUSTIN: You know,
impatience radiates off you

26:24.751 --> 26:27.286
like fog off a Maine coastline.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.456
This is a simple procedure,
and we have a wedding to catch.

26:30.489 --> 26:33.059
Oh. Well, the rumor
is you hate weddings.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.627
I hate being late

26:34.661 --> 26:36.663
more than I hate weddings.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.979
(indistinct announcement
on P.A.)

26:56.983 --> 26:58.517
I see a definite
family resemblance.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.687
ROSE :
Yes.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.489
Bart Jr. is very close
with his grandfather.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.258
They spend a lot of time
together while I'm at work.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.495
Mm. Well, Bart Jr.,
I just got word from the OR,

27:09.528 --> 27:12.598
and your grandfather's surgery
is going just fine.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.466
He should be out
in half an hour,

27:14.500 --> 27:17.269
so you can visit him then.
Does that sound good

27:17.303 --> 27:18.771
Thank you.
Thank you for updating us.

27:18.805 --> 27:21.273
Of course. I'll let you know
when he's out.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.242
-I love these suspenders.
-Thank you.

27:27.046 --> 27:30.316
AUSTIN: Guiding the wire
into appropriate implanting

27:30.349 --> 27:32.651
position at the aortic annulus.

27:32.685 --> 27:35.654
This allows the
delivery system to align

27:35.688 --> 27:38.390
for maximum stability.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.559
Notice how

27:40.592 --> 27:45.231
oh so delicately I push...

27:45.264 --> 27:46.833
Ah.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.568
There.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.670
You may deploy.

27:51.704 --> 27:54.707
Now, slowly turn the deployment

27:54.741 --> 27:57.476
-device counter...
-Done.

27:57.509 --> 27:58.945
I'll close
while you put on a suit.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.849
You do own a suit, right?

28:05.885 --> 28:08.587
NIC:
Wow, you look amazing.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.724
So do you.

28:11.758 --> 28:14.193
He looks good. We can head out.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.097
Hey.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.966
We don't have to leave
right away.

28:27.573 --> 28:28.741
Fourth quarter.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.777
Terrible game.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.912
How you feeling?

28:32.945 --> 28:36.382
Better, thank you.

28:36.415 --> 28:40.219
Look, you mentioned before...

28:40.252 --> 28:41.788
-About your mother.
-That she left you,

28:41.821 --> 28:43.689
and that's not
how I remember it.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.125
Do you want the truth?

28:47.593 --> 28:50.296
Yes.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.931
Okay.

28:51.964 --> 28:55.034
You remember Jack Rogers?

28:55.067 --> 28:57.636
Uh, our next-door
neighbor, yeah.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.139
Your mother fell in love
with him.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.280
-I don't believe it.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.716
I loved your mother.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.285
That was a low point for me.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.622
Rogers was married, as well.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.290
So she left me,

29:18.324 --> 29:20.092
sure that they would
be together,

29:20.126 --> 29:22.895
but in the end,
he stayed with his wife.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.897
And that was the beginning

29:24.931 --> 29:27.333
of a long, downward slide

29:27.366 --> 29:29.836
for your mom.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.637
For-for both of us.

29:31.670 --> 29:34.406
Now, I am not blaming her,

29:34.440 --> 29:38.077
'cause I was gone a lot,

29:38.110 --> 29:41.447
and understandably,

29:41.480 --> 29:44.951
she thought
I didn't appreciate her.

29:44.984 --> 29:48.487
She was a good woman
and a great mother,

29:48.520 --> 29:52.058
and I should have made her
my priority, and I didn't.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.163
And you, as well.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.536
I have to ask.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.705
I have these nightmares.

30:06.738 --> 30:10.877
I see her falling down
the stairs, you arguing,

30:10.910 --> 30:13.479
and...

30:13.512 --> 30:15.447
Did you hit her?

30:15.481 --> 30:19.485
No. Absolutely not.

30:19.518 --> 30:23.722
I mean, we fought
over your custody,

30:23.755 --> 30:26.859
and it got ugly at times,
but as far as physical violence

30:26.893 --> 30:30.162
towards your mother
or any woman-- never.

30:30.196 --> 30:33.532
Conrad, I am flawed

30:33.565 --> 30:36.468
in many ways,

30:36.502 --> 30:39.005
but not like that.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.440
I would sooner die.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.220
I'm glad you came back.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.758
You're my father,

30:59.791 --> 31:02.895
and I love you.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.925
Mark Truscott

31:32.959 --> 31:34.560
Gordon Page
would like to see you.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.071
*

32:08.694 --> 32:10.329
GORDON:
Mark Truscott and I

32:10.362 --> 32:13.165
went to college together.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.067
He's not the only person
at the FDA

32:15.101 --> 32:17.736
who has a stake in QuoVadis.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.372
Take out your company phone.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.012
GORDON:
Unlock it.

32:27.213 --> 32:30.182
Now set it
so it won't lock again.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.354
I trusted you.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.925
What about the patients
who trusted QuoVadis?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.828
-Our devices are safe.
-No, they're not.

32:42.861 --> 32:46.165
I saw the data
you gave Chastain on the VNS.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.600
It wasn't even tested.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.436
You put it in a child.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.004
A child whose mother

32:52.038 --> 32:55.174
lost her other son to cancer.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.009
Your lab is a sham.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.645
Your factory, too,
is an empty warehouse.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.980
You import everything
from China.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.516
Top medical device companies

33:04.550 --> 33:07.653
all use products from China.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.855
And label it
"made in the USA"?

33:09.888 --> 33:11.290
Others did exactly that.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.660
This is fraud.
Outright fraud.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.962
How in God's name did you think
you'd get away with this?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.230
I'm not getting away
with anything.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.366
They're safe,
safe as any others.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.034
Your heart valve killed people.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.204
You are not a team player.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.379
I signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

33:33.412 --> 33:37.583
I-I can't tell anyone
what I know.

33:37.616 --> 33:40.719
If you just let me go, I...

33:40.752 --> 33:42.588
I'll disappear.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.425
I gave you
the golden opportunity

33:46.458 --> 33:48.994
to get into the future
of health care.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.463
To make a fortune.

33:54.300 --> 33:57.303
Do you know what I hate
the most in this world?

34:00.272 --> 34:02.274
Betrayal.

34:12.084 --> 34:14.086
You made it.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.989
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

34:19.258 --> 34:22.861
-I'm gonna say hi to Micah.
-Mm-hmm.

34:22.894 --> 34:25.264
Where's your date?

34:25.297 --> 34:29.101
Oh, well, I plan on meeting
the love of my life here.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.969
It happens at weddings,
you know?

34:31.002 --> 34:32.438
Mm-hmm.

34:35.807 --> 34:36.975
MICAH:
Wow.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.910
This looks awesome.

34:38.944 --> 34:42.080
I am dying for these saris.
I want all of them now.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.883
-It's all so romantic.
-Ugh, wake me
when the ceremony is over.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.718
I take it you're eloping.

34:46.752 --> 34:49.388
Why get married if you don't
want kids? And I don't.

34:49.421 --> 34:50.889
At least, not for
the foreseeable future.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.424
Yeah, me, neither.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.394
You don't want kids?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.962
-I already have a child.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.964
My sister, Jessie.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.736
Hey. You're not on call.
None of us are.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.072
Guys, let's turn off our phones.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.141
Ooh, that's a radical move.

35:09.175 --> 35:12.744
One of life's greatest events.
Birth, death, marriage.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.180
AUSTIN:
And we should honor it.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.451
Hey, guys.
Any of you seen Devon?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.635
I need to speak to Priya.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.004
Uh, you can't. It's bad luck.

35:39.037 --> 35:42.308
Hey, Priya

35:42.341 --> 35:44.310
Devon?

35:44.343 --> 35:46.478
What are you doing here?

35:49.881 --> 35:51.717
Can we have a minute, please?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.553
Mm.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.230
You look great.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.931
So do you.

36:07.399 --> 36:12.137
The most beautiful
I have ever seen you.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.241
What's this about?

36:15.274 --> 36:16.908
We've been together
for three years.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.810
And four months.

36:18.844 --> 36:22.881
And I've loved you
all that time.

36:22.914 --> 36:26.652
And, just as important,
I've respected you.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.689
And that's why I have
to tell you the truth.

36:33.392 --> 36:36.495
Recently, I've been attracted
to somebody else.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.198
I didn't sleep with her,
but I did kiss her.

36:40.232 --> 36:45.237
It's-it's over, and I'm never
gonna see her again.

36:47.439 --> 36:52.043
I tried to put it behind me,

36:52.077 --> 36:54.713
but I can't.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.585
I can't marry you.

36:59.618 --> 37:03.289
Not when I have feelings
for somebody else.

37:05.457 --> 37:09.060
You deserve somebody
that loves you,

37:09.094 --> 37:10.596
and only you.

37:11.997 --> 37:15.367
It would be wrong,

37:15.401 --> 37:17.636
for the both of us.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.806
Your timing sucks.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.209
I realize.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.211
Everyone's here.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.914
Family came from India,
from Boston, from England.

37:28.947 --> 37:32.217
I know, but do we go through
with it because of that?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.620
Why did you wait until now
to tell me?

37:34.653 --> 37:37.556
Because I thought
it was nothing.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.392
Some last-minute panic attack.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.661
But I realize now

37:42.694 --> 37:44.830
that I have real feelings
for this person.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.833
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

37:47.866 --> 37:50.802
I'll talk to everyone. I'll talk
to both parents. It's on me.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.608
You've humiliated me,

37:56.642 --> 38:00.579
and you think this little speech
gets you off the hook?

38:00.612 --> 38:03.349
No, no, I... no, I don't. I...

38:03.382 --> 38:07.285
I'm-I'm ashamed of myself
for hurting you.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.656
But lying or not telling you
would be worse.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.328
Priya.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.963
Please, I'm...

38:17.996 --> 38:20.632
Who are you?

38:20.666 --> 38:22.601
Not the man I loved.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.671
Get out. I never want
to see you again.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.506
Get out!

38:51.763 --> 38:55.033
Hey, I told you
it would be fine.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.168
ROSE:
I'm so relieved, Dad.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.304
We just can't do it without you.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.976
Well, looks like you're gonna be
stuck with me for a while yet.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.545
Hey, honey, you want
to kiss Grandpa?

39:06.578 --> 39:08.580
We're gonna let him rest, okay?
Yeah?

39:08.614 --> 39:10.348
Hey, amigo. Ho, ho!

39:12.584 --> 39:15.186
It's gonna be a whole new phase
of life for you, Dad.

39:15.220 --> 39:19.725
Thank you, darling,
for being here for me.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.093
I feel so sorry
for all the people

39:22.127 --> 39:26.932
who are in the hospital
all alone.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.035
That'll never be you.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.542
-Good night.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.361
Oh, my God. Mr. Winthrop!

40:09.941 --> 40:11.376
He has a rigid abdomen
with tenderness,

40:11.409 --> 40:13.979
guarding and rebound.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.981
Stand back.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.784
Free air.
It's a bowel perforation.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.118
He needs emergency surgery.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.620
Wh-Who's on call
for emergency gen surg?

40:21.653 --> 40:22.754

40:23.789 --> 40:25.423

You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:02.708 --> 44:05.243
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:07.746 --> 44:08.980
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.651
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:13.685 --> 44:17.222
