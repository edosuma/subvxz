00:03.792 --> 00:07.875
The joust is a highly-specialized
combat technique.

00:08.333 --> 00:11.792
It's all about control, balance and grace.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.625
Stop! You're beating the Grace out of him.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.000
Hey, hey, hey, put down your pugil stick.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.750
Forget that! I'm taking this thing
on the bus with me.

00:23.834 --> 00:24.667
What are you... ow!

00:30.667 --> 00:31.625
Rudy!

00:32.375 --> 00:33.250
Ty?

00:33.750 --> 00:34.667
What are you doing here?

00:35.041 --> 00:37.375
I was over at the nail salon
getting a power pedicure.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.667
Which, by the way, is manly
because it has the word "power" in it.

00:42.959 --> 00:46.458
And when I came out,
I found this under my windshield wiper.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.375
What is it?

00:47.458 --> 00:51.250
It's the thing that goes back and forth
on your car when it's raining.

00:52.709 --> 00:53.667
It's amazing.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.083
What's amazing is you're 19
and still in the seventh grade.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.166
This is what I'm talking about.

01:01.709 --> 01:04.959
Your Bobby Wasabi flyer was on my car.

01:05.625 --> 01:08.083
This is a declaration of war, Rudy.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.000
This isn't about flyers, Ty.

01:10.875 --> 01:13.583
It's about the feud that started
between us 15 years ago.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.041
What you did to me was wrong!

01:16.542 --> 01:17.500
But it doesn't matter.

01:17.875 --> 01:20.083
Because I'm still the best Sensei
in this town.

01:21.959 --> 01:24.792
You up for a little joust?

01:26.250 --> 01:28.875
I never walked away
from a joust in my life.

01:38.417 --> 01:39.583
Now, if you don't mind,

01:39.667 --> 01:42.250
I'd like to take a moment
to harness my chi.

01:42.834 --> 01:43.709
I'll do the same.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.333
Om...

01:48.917 --> 01:50.083
Ha-ha!

01:50.166 --> 01:52.166

Hey!

02:37.709 --> 02:39.333
Thanks for meeting me, Kim.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.875
Well, you said it was important.
What do you want to ask me?

02:42.375 --> 02:43.667
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

02:44.625 --> 02:47.583
I've been wanting to say for a long time
but I haven't had the courage.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.625
Milton, are you sure you really want to?

02:50.709 --> 02:53.041
Kim, I finally feel like
I'm ready to go out with a girl...

02:53.125 --> 02:54.041
Milton, stop.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.333
I don't... I don't want to hurt you

02:57.417 --> 03:00.667
or talk about this ever again...

03:02.083 --> 03:05.000
but, uh, I only think of you as a friend.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.875
Wait, you thought I was talking
about you and me?

03:10.291 --> 03:13.291
I'm sorry, that is hilarious.

03:15.417 --> 03:17.917
Wait, why is that funny exactly?

03:18.750 --> 03:21.959
No offense, Kim.
I'm sure you're somebody's type.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.792
But you're just not mine.

03:24.959 --> 03:26.041
Oh, good.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.125
I like this girl named Julie.

03:30.625 --> 03:34.583
The first time I saw her
in chemistry class, my heart stopped.

04:15.667 --> 04:19.250
I'm terrified to ask her out.
What if she says no?

04:19.542 --> 04:20.458
Gah!

04:21.709 --> 04:23.500
Relax, I got this.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.500
I'm really good
at helping people find love.

04:26.458 --> 04:27.542
Thank you.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.125
I just...

04:29.208 --> 04:33.500
Um, one thing and it's not like
I really care or anything,

04:33.917 --> 04:34.834
but, uh...

04:35.959 --> 04:37.500
how am I not your type?

04:38.792 --> 04:39.750
Let it go, Kim.

04:40.667 --> 04:41.959
It's never gonna happen.

Still mad at me for beating you
in the joust yesterday?

04:55.625 --> 04:57.041
You cried like a little girl.

04:58.917 --> 05:02.125
I wasn't crying.
That was a Colombian war chant.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.959
- Okay, you should have been terrified.
- Huh.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.500
Besides, there's nothing
you can do better than me.

05:09.583 --> 05:10.667
Huh, really?

05:11.709 --> 05:13.125
I'm a better rapper than you are.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.667
I even got a job at the mall,
rapping for Falafel Phil's

05:16.750 --> 05:18.333
to help him drum up some business.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.250
He only got that idea

05:20.333 --> 05:23.083
because Captain Corndog hired me
to rap for him.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.250
You got nothing.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.125
Please. I can spit rhymes
about anything. Call it.

05:29.542 --> 05:32.417

06:04.834 --> 06:06.166
Hey, I'm Julie.

06:06.583 --> 06:07.458
Hey.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.083
I pass by your locker every day.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.166
I can't believe I finally got the courage
to talk to you.

06:12.625 --> 06:13.583
Okay.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.333
Okay, well, this is all kind of new to me.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.208
What the heck, I'll just say it.

06:18.291 --> 06:19.250
I really like--

06:19.333 --> 06:20.375
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

06:20.709 --> 06:22.166
We don't even know each other and...

06:22.583 --> 06:24.917
I was going to say
I like your friend Milton.

06:25.709 --> 06:27.250
Oh, oh, Milton!

06:27.834 --> 06:29.333
I thought you were gonna say you liked me.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.125
You and me? That's funny.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.041
You are so not my type.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.500
I like a manly man.

06:42.041 --> 06:42.959
Okay then.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.625
The first time I saw Milton in chemistry,

06:46.959 --> 06:50.250
it was like I was watching a movie
and he was the star.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.000
I'd love to go out with him.

07:17.458 --> 07:18.917
But what if he doesn't like me?

07:19.375 --> 07:20.500
Gah!

07:23.041 --> 07:25.583
You know what?
You guys would be great together.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.917
- Let me see what I can do.
- Really? Thank you so much.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Eh, no problem.

07:30.875 --> 07:31.709
So, uh...

07:32.417 --> 07:33.458
Uh...

07:34.417 --> 07:36.667
I'm not a manly man? I mean...

07:37.500 --> 07:39.625
nothing here or here works for you?

07:42.041 --> 07:44.417
Let it go, Jack.
It's never going to happen.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.166
So Milton likes Julie
and Julie likes Milton?

07:53.709 --> 07:56.208
- Do you know what this means?
- Yes, I do.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.417
It's a perfect storm of nerd love.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.250
This isn't a joke, Jack.
We have to help them.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.583
Today he tried giving her flowers
and, uh...

08:07.041 --> 08:08.375
it didn't go so well.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.041
Uh, what are those?

08:18.375 --> 08:19.208
They're...

08:19.792 --> 08:20.834
my lunch.

08:31.792 --> 08:34.208
I've got an idea.
Okay, Falafel Phil's tomorrow night.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.750
I'll bring Julie and you bring Milton.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.625
And do not let him bring roses.

08:38.709 --> 08:40.500
He was passing gas all afternoon.

08:42.417 --> 08:43.375
It was disgusting.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.083

09:50.792 --> 09:54.333
I hear you guys have chemistry together.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.750
Julie, I'm sorry.
If you want to go home, I get it.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.166
I don't want to go home.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.083

Guys, we're good if you wanna sit
at another table.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.917
- Pshaw, no.
- Yeah, no, I think we should probably...

10:25.000 --> 10:25.875
We wanna be alone.

10:27.959 --> 10:29.709
Oh, yeah.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.083
I see.

10:31.166 --> 10:32.583
Yeah.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.583
- What just happened?
- I'll tell you what just happened.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.208
They just broke up with us.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.125
<i>Milton.</i>

10:49.208 --> 10:51.500
Maybe you'd like to introduce me
to your lady friend?

10:51.959 --> 10:53.750
Rudy, this is Julie.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.375
And like me, she feels that Pluto

10:55.458 --> 10:57.709
was unfairly downgraded
from planet status.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.333
- Asteroid, my butt!
-

11:03.834 --> 11:07.208
Meeting Milton was the best thing that's
happened to me since I moved here.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.250
While Julie's parents are in Europe,
she's living with her uncle.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.375
See, that's what families are all about.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.208
Your Uncle sounds like a great guy.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.208
There you are.

11:16.458 --> 11:19.125
- Frank told me he saw you two together.
- Yeah!

11:21.333 --> 11:23.834
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get my niece.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.917
- Ty is your Uncle?
- Julie is your niece?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.375
Yes, she is.
And I forbid her from seeing him.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.208
You can't forbid her from seeing him,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.709
because I forbid him from seeing her.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.458
- Well, I forbid them first.
- No, I forbid...

11:35.542 --> 11:36.375
Forbidden!

11:49.041 --> 11:51.917
Rudy would freak if he knew
we were helping Milton and Julie.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.000
I don't care. We have to help them.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.000
I believe in a thing called love.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.667
- Oh!
- Hmm.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.041
I'm sorry we have to meet in an alley.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.333
I don't mind the alley.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.834
When I'm with you,
I can ignore the smell of the...

12:16.500 --> 12:17.333
No, I'm sorry.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.709
That dumpster smells
like where diapers go to die.

12:22.166 --> 12:23.417
Here they are!

12:23.500 --> 12:24.625
Guys, get out of here.

12:26.583 --> 12:28.667
You probably shouldn't have done that.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.166
Again.

13:01.959 --> 13:03.291
The joke's on you.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.583
I landed in all these soft diapers.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.083
So after all of the forbidding I did,

13:17.166 --> 13:20.166
Milton and Julie are still sneaking around
and seeing each other?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.208
They can't see each other anymore.
You know why?

13:23.250 --> 13:24.959
Because of you and Ty!

13:25.041 --> 13:27.166
But I got news for you, mister.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.834
- Okay, okay, thank you.
- It's not...

13:28.917 --> 13:30.000
Thank you, Kim.

13:31.625 --> 13:35.458
Rudy, you've been feuding with Ty
for 15 years.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.083
How did it even start?

13:37.750 --> 13:38.667
Well...

13:39.625 --> 13:41.792
we were both studying
with the Grand Master.

13:42.166 --> 13:45.333
But only one of us would be deemed
worthy of being his apprentice.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.291
<i>We stood at the top of a mountain
for our final competition.</i>

13:49.375 --> 13:51.959

14:00.667 --> 14:02.250
<i>We battled for hours,</i>

14:02.333 --> 14:04.542
<i>trying to knock each other
off those stumps.</i>

14:05.834 --> 14:07.417
Oh, gross!

14:08.166 --> 14:09.500
Whoo! Whoa!

14:11.208 --> 14:13.125
No fair! He cheated.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.625
I was distracted, Grand Master.

14:14.709 --> 14:16.750
He tooted. He tooted!

14:19.041 --> 14:20.458
So I became his apprentice,

14:21.250 --> 14:24.125
and Ty vowed that he would never rest
until he got his revenge.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.208
- So you stunk him off his stump?
- No!

14:28.583 --> 14:29.875
It was the grand master.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.250
Rudy, it's time for this thing to end.

14:37.667 --> 14:40.125
Let me arrange a sit-down
so you and Ty can talk things out.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.709
Do it for Milton and Julie.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.083
Yeah, maybe you're right.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.250
Maybe it is time to move on,

14:49.375 --> 14:51.083
and finally bury the hatchet.

14:54.834 --> 14:57.917
All right, no more rapping wars!

14:58.291 --> 15:00.041
Now we're gonna squash this beef

15:00.125 --> 15:03.417
by letting the crowd decide
who's number one, okay?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.333
Now, up first is Eddie,

15:06.333 --> 15:08.917
The Rhyming Falafel Ball.

You call that "bringing it"?

15:55.417 --> 15:58.750
These people came here
to hear some real rap,

15:58.834 --> 16:00.542

16:01.583 --> 16:05.125

16:58.125 --> 17:00.917
We're here tonight
to put aside our differences

17:01.000 --> 17:03.208
because we care about Milton and Julie.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.333
Now, if anyone would like
to say something, now is the time.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.542
I really like the way Kim's hair smells.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.083
That's all I got.

17:20.750 --> 17:21.834
Wow!

17:21.917 --> 17:23.667
Rudy, maybe you'd like to say something.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.000
Fine!

17:32.333 --> 17:33.583
What Jack said is true.

17:33.667 --> 17:37.125
Tonight is about Milton and Julie.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.250
I'd like us to, you know...

17:45.000 --> 17:47.208
- let bygones be bygones.
- Hmm.

17:50.959 --> 17:51.875
<i>Excellent!</i>

17:52.208 --> 17:54.000
Sensei Ty,
maybe you'd like to say something.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.834
Maybe we should just try and get along.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.583
Great! I think we've settled things.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.625
Now, let's just all enjoy our meal.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.041
Uh, excuse me, what are you doing?

18:14.125 --> 18:15.959
- I'm taking the last falafel ball.
- No, no.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.709
This is my ball. My fork was on it.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.875
My fork was on it first. Get off it.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.917
Never going to happen.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.875

- Anywhere.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.166
- We found 'em.
- Where were you two?

19:17.250 --> 19:18.333
We were worried sick.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.333
They have something to say.

19:22.542 --> 19:23.709
Milton and I have talked.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.041
And we're not going to see
each other anymore.

19:29.291 --> 19:32.291
Goodbye, Julie. I'll never forget you.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.542
Goodbye, Milton.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

19:38.208 --> 19:41.166
Wait! I want to say something.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.333
No. No, I want to say something.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.625
You and it's... I feel someone...

19:46.709 --> 19:48.041
Something and you're...

19:48.166 --> 19:50.291
But then, and you all just went...

19:50.375 --> 19:52.333
But it's here, and it's here,
and then I...

19:52.417 --> 19:53.542
I want to say something!

19:53.625 --> 19:54.458
<i>You know what?</i>

19:56.291 --> 19:58.583
I finally understand Ty completely.

19:59.834 --> 20:02.625
We've let our problems
become your problems.

20:03.375 --> 20:06.875
Milton, Julie, we won't stand in your way.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.709
Thank you, Rudy.

20:10.333 --> 20:14.083
I got Milton and Julie together.
My work here is done.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.500
- Julie.
- Milton.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.667
- Rudy.
- Ty.

20:28.542 --> 20:30.375
- Kim.
- Frank.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.625
Did I imagine that
or did she just flip me?

20:36.875 --> 20:38.750
Oh, you must have imagined it.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.583
Come on. You know what?

20:40.959 --> 20:43.083
- You should go give her a hug.
- Okay.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.166
- Kim.
- Frank.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.500
Oh, Frank, you're gonna be

I'm glad we're not fighting anymore.

21:01.208 --> 21:04.250
Yeah, me too.
Rapping's about expressing yourself,

21:04.333 --> 21:06.500
not about selling falafels and corndogs.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.500
Yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.417
I think taking this class together
is really going to make us better rappers.

21:12.875 --> 21:15.291
All right, here we go, y'all.
