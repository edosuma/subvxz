I think he
broke his egg.

01:11.037 --> 01:12.527
Hey, it's okay, BMO.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.675
Look, Jake and I'll
make you a funny face.

01:17.977 --> 01:19.774
Bleh! Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!

01:23.316 --> 01:25.011
Here, BMO,
this'll cheer you up.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.518
What the...

01:33.660 --> 01:34.490
Well...

01:34.561 --> 01:36.028
I'm out of ideas.

01:36.096 --> 01:36.926
What?

01:39.632 --> 01:44.126
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

01:44.204 --> 01:46.104
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

01:48.041 --> 01:49.201
Aw, man!

01:49.275 --> 01:51.300
James Baxter is so good, man!

01:51.377 --> 01:54.005
He always knows just what
to say to cheer a guy up.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.240
Yeah, man.

01:56.649 --> 02:00.380
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

02:00.453 --> 02:01.477
James Baxter!

02:01.554 --> 02:02.418
So good!

02:02.489 --> 02:03.547
Man!

02:03.623 --> 02:05.591
We should do it, too...
do his thing and spread

02:05.658 --> 02:06.682
the good will!

02:06.759 --> 02:08.056
Yeah, man!

02:08.127 --> 02:10.187
I want to be like
James Baxter,

02:10.263 --> 02:12.322
always rollin' in
on his beach ball,

02:12.398 --> 02:14.195
sayin' his name
in a horse voice,

02:14.267 --> 02:15.928
makin' people smile!

02:17.170 --> 02:18.865
Let's do it!

02:18.938 --> 02:20.428
Yeah!

02:22.909 --> 02:27.243
Fi-i-nn the huma-a-n!

02:27.313 --> 02:30.407
Ja-a-ake!

02:30.483 --> 02:31.848
F-i-nn!

02:31.918 --> 02:35.081
Ja-a-ke!

02:36.422 --> 02:38.322
Sheesh. Tough crowd.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.053
I think we should find an
easier person to cheer up.

02:41.127 --> 02:43.391
It was a mistake to do
this at a funeral.

02:52.906 --> 02:53.736
Ah!

02:56.042 --> 02:56.872
Fi-i-nn!

02:56.943 --> 02:57.773
Ja-a-ke!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.009
Fi-i-nn!

03:00.079 --> 03:01.011
Ja-a-ke!

03:07.387 --> 03:08.354
Fi-i-nn!

03:08.421 --> 03:09.479
Ja-a-ke!

03:09.556 --> 03:10.523
What do you want?!

03:10.590 --> 03:11.522
Please!

03:11.591 --> 03:12.751
I'm just a very sad girl!

03:12.825 --> 03:13.792
Fi-i-nn!

03:13.860 --> 03:15.418
Ja-a-ke!

03:24.504 --> 03:26.028
Baxter!

03:26.105 --> 03:27.072
James!

03:27.140 --> 03:28.698
That's so perfect.

03:28.775 --> 03:29.673
Yeah, man.

03:29.742 --> 03:30.731
So unique.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.869
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

03:34.180 --> 03:36.239
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

03:36.316 --> 03:38.307
Man, what's he doing
that we're not?

03:38.384 --> 03:40.249
We just got to figure <i>that</i> out!

03:40.320 --> 03:43.517
No... it's like...
he's shredding on a guitar,

03:43.590 --> 03:46.115
and learning how to shred isn't
just copying the exact notes

03:46.192 --> 03:47.682
of someone else's solo.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.024
You need to learn how
to do your <i>own</i> solo!

03:53.766 --> 03:55.563
Bling, blong!

03:55.635 --> 03:59.298
Wah-wah-whoo,
wah-wah-wah wah-wah-whoo!

03:59.372 --> 04:00.236
Wah-wah-wah-wah!

04:00.306 --> 04:01.295
Whoop!

04:01.374 --> 04:04.502
Whooopsh!

04:04.577 --> 04:06.807
Wah wah-wah!

04:06.879 --> 04:07.709
Na-na-na-na-na!

04:07.780 --> 04:09.042
Boodala-boodala-boodala-boodala!

04:09.115 --> 04:10.104
Boodala-boodala-boodala-boodala!

04:10.183 --> 04:11.741
Boodala-boodala-boodala-boodala!

04:11.818 --> 04:12.978
Boodala-boodala-boodala-boodala!

04:15.688 --> 04:18.248
Why am I recording?

04:18.324 --> 04:19.916
You're documenting our
creative flow in case

04:19.993 --> 04:21.119
we make a breakthrough.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.685
Dude, I think we
<i>do</i> got something.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.730
Let's check the video!

04:27.567 --> 04:29.592
Bathtub! Bathtub!

04:29.669 --> 04:31.660
All right, BMO,
play the video.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.435
Who's gonna scrub me?

04:36.509 --> 04:37.441
I'll scrub.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.000
You take notes.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.614
Yeah, right there.

04:43.683 --> 04:44.513
Speed it up.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.576
Slow it down.

04:49.656 --> 04:52.124
Yeah! That sounds makes
me feel happy!

04:52.191 --> 04:53.351
Good, good!

04:53.426 --> 04:54.552
Happy's what we want.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.027
BMO,
zoom in on my mouth!

05:00.233 --> 05:03.930
Yeah, it's good, but if we
want to be <i>James Baxter</i> good,

05:04.003 --> 05:05.402
we got to go deeper.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.248
The Institute of So-und.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.285
Hey! Hey, man!

05:19.352 --> 05:20.944
I receive you.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.387
Welcome to the Sound
Institute of So-und.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.823
Where is the studio to make
the best feel-good sound?

05:26.893 --> 05:30.590
Just think happy thoughts and
follow the beat of your hearts.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.687
Hmm.

05:35.935 --> 05:38.529
Hold up.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.435
This way.

05:47.313 --> 05:50.805
Look at this tricked-out studio.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.350
Half stacks,
full stacks!

05:52.418 --> 05:53.817
Oh!

05:53.886 --> 05:55.114
Distortion pedals!

05:59.892 --> 06:04.226
These sounds make
feel good right here!

06:04.297 --> 06:06.322
Right here! Good!

06:06.399 --> 06:08.299
I feel it here!

06:08.368 --> 06:09.665
Good here!

06:09.736 --> 06:12.899
We need to figure out
how to make our sound...

06:12.972 --> 06:15.770
<i>force</i> happiness
into the listener!

06:20.780 --> 06:23.772
Whoa!

06:29.522 --> 06:31.285
Check our data?

06:31.357 --> 06:32.654
Maybe it should be higher?

06:32.725 --> 06:33.692
Yeah, maybe...
maybe it could be lower...

06:33.760 --> 06:34.692
I don't know.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.559
Let's both agree that
<i>that</i> sound belongs there.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.961
See that sound?

06:39.031 --> 06:41.295
I drew that sound connecting
to two other sounds.

06:41.367 --> 06:42.391
Hmm.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.026
Something's missing,
though.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.362
That's it!

06:48.441 --> 06:49.567
The missing thing
in our thing!

06:49.642 --> 06:50.768
Yeah!

06:50.843 --> 06:52.572
James Baxter don't just
got his catch phrase...

06:52.645 --> 06:54.442
he's also got his
beach-ball biz.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.778
So we got to create
feel-good body actions

06:56.849 --> 06:59.340
to go with
our feel-good sound!

06:59.419 --> 07:00.852
We just crushed it,
homey.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.253
Dude, seriously, I think our
thing is gonna change the world.

07:04.323 --> 07:07.815
When people experience it,
it's gonna make them <i>so</i> happy.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.691
You're building
it up too much.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.128
Let's just do it.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.064
Yeah, man.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.499
Yeah.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.267
Hey!
There's the sad girl.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.771
What?

07:27.847 --> 07:29.246
No, no, no!
Wait a sec!

07:29.315 --> 07:30.714
Reserve judgment until
you've seen the

07:30.783 --> 07:32.944
freshed-up version of
our thing!

07:47.300 --> 07:49.700
We did it!

07:52.038 --> 07:54.336
Bummed.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.772
What's wrong?

07:55.842 --> 07:57.173
We're bummed.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.112
Boo.

08:04.183 --> 08:07.084
Boo.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.415
Boo?

08:15.461 --> 08:17.190
Boo!

08:17.263 --> 08:19.094
Common rhinoceros beetle...

08:19.165 --> 08:21.998
scientific name...
xylotrupes Ulysses.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.229
Common dung beetle...
Oh, my!

08:34.679 --> 08:36.307
Oh, good.
You're still here.

08:36.381 --> 08:37.542
Hey, I know we were
here yesterday...

08:38.717 --> 08:39.809
...and we came off
as inappropriate...

08:39.885 --> 08:41.080
Dude, let's just
do the thing!

08:41.153 --> 08:42.211
Right, okay.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.410
Dude!

09:18.357 --> 09:23.886
Why have you
upset my deal?!

09:23.963 --> 09:25.624
Jake, come on, man.
I need some help.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.825
Sorry.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.868
I acted like a
little kitty cat.

09:32.004 --> 09:33.198
Hyup!

09:37.777 --> 09:39.506
Whoa!

09:39.579 --> 09:40.910
It's milk!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.279
Why?!

09:48.354 --> 09:49.548
Dang, this is real.

09:49.622 --> 09:50.452
Aah!

09:54.994 --> 09:56.518
He broke my squishy bones.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.592
Don't worry, Jake.
I'll block this one.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.498
Finn, when we wake up
in the ninth dead world,

10:02.568 --> 10:05.059
promise me you'll
listen for this sound.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.504
What?

10:08.574 --> 10:10.735
It's just that there's a
lot of dead people there.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.038
We might get separated.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.442
I'll be the one going...

10:16.182 --> 10:18.047
Hyah!

10:28.961 --> 10:31.020
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

10:35.101 --> 10:39.128
Ja-a-mes Baxter!

10:39.205 --> 10:42.265
Hey. Holy cow.

10:45.411 --> 10:46.901
Hey, man.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.243
Uh, this guy really knows
how to cheer a guy up.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.475
It's awesome.

10:50.549 --> 10:51.675
Hey, do you know this guy?

10:51.751 --> 10:52.945
Well... sort of.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.213
Yeah, we know him!

10:54.286 --> 10:56.083
Huh. What's his deal?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.679
His name's James Baxter.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.021
He just travels around
on his beach ball,

11:00.092 --> 11:02.253
making people happy.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.592
J-a-ames Baxter!

11:04.664 --> 11:05.562
