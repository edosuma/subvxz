A NETFLIX SERIES

00:13.120 --> 00:17.080
<i>It happened two months</i>
<i>after we started the Chatter Box.</i>

00:17.720 --> 00:21.080
<i>Somewhere, 600 kilometers away</i>
<i>from Amsterdam,</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:24.280
<i>a guard at the Berlin Wall received orders</i>

00:24.360 --> 00:28.040
<i>to open the border</i>
<i>between East and West Berlin.</i>

00:31.800 --> 00:34.600
<i>Open the gate!</i>

00:34.680 --> 00:39.360
<i>It was the end of the Cold War,</i>
<i>and people flowed into West Berlin.</i>

00:40.560 --> 00:42.360
<i>An impromptu party broke out</i>

00:42.440 --> 00:44.680
<i>to celebrate the dawn of a new era.</i>

00:44.760 --> 00:46.160
THE WALL IS GONE!

00:46.240 --> 00:50.280
<i>An era of freedom</i>
<i>and unlimited possibilities.</i>

00:51.240 --> 00:53.880
<i>A time where you could be who you wanted</i>

00:53.960 --> 00:55.320
<i>and become who you truly are.</i>

00:58.280 --> 01:01.160
<i>The wall is gone!</i>

01:02.120 --> 01:02.960
<i>And me?</i>

01:03.600 --> 01:05.640
<i>I was nowhere near</i>
<i>being who I wanted to be.</i>

01:06.160 --> 01:08.600
<i>Nor where I wanted to be, for that matter.</i>

01:08.680 --> 01:12.600
<i>Six weeks after Leon left his wife,</i>
<i>I found myself sitting with him</i>

01:12.680 --> 01:15.000
<i>in an average pizza place</i>
<i>with stuffy company.</i>

01:15.080 --> 01:18.200
Marly, tell me
about the research for your thesis.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.200
Leon tells me
you've found an interesting subject.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.400
Yes.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.160
We're researching sexual
and emotional responses

01:25.240 --> 01:27.320
to visual erotica in women.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.360
That's interesting.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.680
I've introduced her to Heiman
to focus the research

01:31.760 --> 01:33.840
on the dominance
of the identifiable figure.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.720
Yes. But wasn't that based
on erotic sound recordings?

01:36.800 --> 01:38.760
Yes, that's where I got the idea.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.640
At the 06 phone line company I work for,
we started a sex line for women.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.800
So you work for a 06 line company?

01:44.880 --> 01:45.720
Yes.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.520
For Teledutch.
It started as a job alongside my studies--

01:49.600 --> 01:51.320
And it's still a side job.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.000
It's funny because it actually all started

01:54.080 --> 01:57.160
with your book,
<i>Sexuality in All Its Dimensions.</i>

01:57.240 --> 02:00.920
It's always been
a great turn on for our students.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.240
They're a bit work-obsessed
when you get them together like that.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.560
Lydia could never really cope with them

02:12.080 --> 02:15.600
rambling on about vasocongestion
or vaginal penetration over dinner.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.960
You seem to have survived.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.880
Norbert thinks
I could do a PhD on my thesis subject.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.400
Actually, I can recommend
an excellent PhD supervisor.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.440
One who, very soon,
will have his own house

02:34.520 --> 02:38.800
where you can fire
all your questions at him, night and day.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.280
Sure. I still have to graduate first.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.320
Yes. And quit
that little side job of yours.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.800
Why?

02:47.440 --> 02:50.000
Don't you want to be taken seriously
as an academic?

02:51.160 --> 02:52.000
<i>Well, thanks.</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:55.920
<i>I started to wonder</i>
<i>if Leon was taking me seriously.</i>

03:15.440 --> 03:18.720
-Did someone call the all-night drugstore?
-Yes, I did.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.000
Hi, man.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.280
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

04:15.720 --> 04:16.880
-Leave it.
-No.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.400
-Leave it.
-No. It'll wake up the kids.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.240
-Ramon, leave it.
-No.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.200
Stigter speaking.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.000
Hello, who is this?

04:28.840 --> 04:29.680
Hello?

04:33.600 --> 04:36.840
Well, wrong number.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.000
-Hey.
-Is there someone else?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.320
What?

04:44.720 --> 04:45.600
No, why?

04:47.040 --> 04:51.360
-You come home later every night.
-Hey. I can't work regular hours.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.680
Frank doesn't start till noon.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.320
We don't have to have sex, you know?
I know plenty of people here, who…

05:05.840 --> 05:08.480
-I understand.
-What?

05:08.560 --> 05:12.160
A baker doesn't feel like cookies at night
when he's been baking all day.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.720
But I'm not a baker.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.520
-No, but you deal with sex all day.
-I don't deal with sex all day.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.800
-At work.
-Do you have someone on the side?

05:21.320 --> 05:22.600
-No.
-Well, then.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.600
Goddamn it, Natas.

05:27.000 --> 05:27.920
Ramon…

05:31.880 --> 05:34.640
We can get some beers
on the road, can't we?

05:34.720 --> 05:37.760
-Yes. Have you got tampons?
-Hey. Where are you going?

05:39.200 --> 05:42.080
-Hey.
-Hi. We're off to Berlin.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.480
There's going to be a big party, so…

05:45.440 --> 05:48.080
Yeah, we didn't know how to reach you.

05:48.840 --> 05:52.800
But you're welcome to come.
Rachel's borrowed her mom's car and…

05:52.880 --> 05:56.480
Yes, there's five of us already,
but we can make room.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.360
Are you coming?
I mean, it's a historic moment.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.440
A once-in-a-lifetime event, you know?

06:03.520 --> 06:05.000
No, I…

06:05.960 --> 06:08.120
I have to work, but you go ahead.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.160
Hi!

06:12.760 --> 06:14.120
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.680
No, I'm serious.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.480
-I'll bring you back a piece of the wall.
-Janna, are you coming?

06:23.120 --> 06:24.520
-Janna, come on.
-Bye.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.400
Yes, everyone in!

06:27.680 --> 06:28.720
Yes!

06:42.280 --> 06:43.120
Frank.

06:44.920 --> 06:45.880
Frank.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.440
Hey, Poekie.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.520
Why aren't you responding?

07:01.160 --> 07:02.200
I was asleep.

07:02.920 --> 07:03.960
Can we talk?

07:06.720 --> 07:07.600
Really talk.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.120
Right.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.200
Yes, Johnny,

07:22.560 --> 07:24.400
he swung by with some people.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.400
-Where's Django?
-You look terrible.

07:30.120 --> 07:30.960
Thank you.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.320
Why don't you call back?
You won't talk to the lawyer.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.000
-Why are you being so difficult?
-I'm not.

07:39.680 --> 07:40.880
Hey, it…

07:41.840 --> 07:43.360
It's a really big step.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.640
I want to think it over first.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.840
There's nothing left to think about.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.520
We're divorcing
and I get half of everything.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.120
Yes.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.000
Half.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.000
-Of everything.
-Yes.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.000
Of the house too?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.320
I want to stay
in our old house with Django.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.320
Of the business too?

08:08.360 --> 08:10.720
Marriage law says it's shared property.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.400
And you want half

08:13.520 --> 08:14.520
of everything. Right.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
Of the painting too?

08:17.560 --> 08:20.960
-I don't want the painting.
-You want half of everything. Right?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.520
-Frank.
-Which half do you want?

08:24.200 --> 08:26.000
-There.
-Frank.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.680
Right.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.040
You're crazy.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.320
Here you go! I earned all of this!

08:40.480 --> 08:42.000
Not you! I did!

08:53.160 --> 08:54.200
Hey.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.440
-Jesus.
-Sorry.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.040
-What are you doing here?
-I still had these.

09:01.560 --> 09:05.280
And Janna has one of my record cases.
Is she here?

09:05.800 --> 09:06.880
Sorry, this is

09:07.400 --> 09:10.640
female porn for my thesis research.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.600
Is it different?

09:15.920 --> 09:16.760
Yes.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.800
It's geared more towards women.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.920
The women take the initiative more often
and the men are more handsome.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.080
Fun course.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.600
Janna's gone to Berlin. With Eva.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.360
So, you're alone.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.080
You came for your records.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.320
Janna dumped me.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.560
Yeah. But she's still
my best friend, Misch.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.080
Who left for Berlin without me,
but whatever.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.360
So, we'd better not.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.040
Hey, if you do want to go to Berlin,

10:14.120 --> 10:17.280
a small group of us are setting off
from the RoXY after closing.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.800
<i>Whose car is that outside?</i>

10:49.520 --> 10:52.680
How many times have I told you
I don't want tin cans parked out front?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.400
It belongs to these gentlemen.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.720
-Sorry, did we have an appointment?
-No.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.480
They're from the IRS.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.520
This is Jaap Das. He's our accountant.

11:19.600 --> 11:25.800
Jaap, these gentlemen from the IRS
have gone over our corporate tax returns--

11:25.880 --> 11:28.440
-And VAT.
-And VAT.

11:28.960 --> 11:33.440
And they've detected some irregularities.
Could you clear things up for them?

11:34.840 --> 11:37.840
<i>Uncle Jaap had always known</i>
<i>this day would come.</i>

11:38.360 --> 11:40.040
<i>Frank should have known too.</i>

11:40.120 --> 11:43.960
Turnover is profit, VAT is holiday pay.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.320
Turnover is profit…

11:47.400 --> 11:51.040
…and VAT is holiday pay.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.000
<i>As a result, Teledutch owed millions</i>

11:55.520 --> 11:57.840
<i>which they'd never be able to pay back.</i>

11:58.480 --> 11:59.440
Jaap?

12:04.680 --> 12:07.720
We could pay part of the outstanding taxes
from our reserve account.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.600
-For the first term.
-What reserve account?

12:10.680 --> 12:13.440
Here are some transfers
into a reserve account.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.400
It has around three hundred grand.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.600
-Three hundred grand.
-Right?

12:18.680 --> 12:21.600
Yes, the reserve account
is not an actual account.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.840
That's the name we gave to a credit card.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.280
For the tab we're running.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.400
At Yab Yum.

12:32.440 --> 12:34.040
Did you spend three hundred grand--

12:34.120 --> 12:36.920
-The champagne is 650 guilders a bottle.
-Paid by the company?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.400
We've taken business folks there
to schmooze them.

12:39.480 --> 12:42.400
That's tax deductible. And that Brit.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.400
-Have we heard from him?
-He's recovering well.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.600
Jesus. Yeah, let's bring that up again!
Are you out of your minds?

12:51.680 --> 12:52.520
God.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.040
-Yes?
-<i>Is this a good time?</i>

12:55.120 --> 12:58.000
-No, not really. What's up?
-I really need to talk to you.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.120
Things are pretty bad with Frank.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.480
<i>What's up?</i>

13:03.960 --> 13:04.880
There you are.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.280
I was thinking, what if we put
six extra consoles on the Chatter Box?

13:08.360 --> 13:09.600
We'll add a gay option too.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.680
The gays will love
chatting among themselves.

13:11.760 --> 13:15.040
By the time we get that tax bill,
we'll have doubled our turnover.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.120
Did you throw a painting at Anouk?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.360
-It wasn't worth anything.
-Frank.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.320
She threw a vase at me once, okay?

13:25.400 --> 13:28.200
-How are you going to pay her?
-Pay her?

13:28.280 --> 13:29.760
-Yes.
-It's my painting.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.240
She's getting half of everything.
Your shares too.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.320
They're not worth that much right now.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.240
You promised not to screw up.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.640
It's not like your marriage
is running so smoothly.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.200
I'm talking about you and me!

13:41.480 --> 13:44.360
-What do you mean?
-Should pay your wife more attention.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.640
Says who?

13:46.720 --> 13:49.120
The women tell each other everything.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.520
Do you think I didn't know about
all the times you couldn't get it up?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.600
Isn't it time you called a doctor?

13:58.440 --> 14:01.240
-Come on!
-Three hundred grand at Yab Yum?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.320
At least mine still works.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.520
-It's the only thing you're good at.
-Come on, then.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.320
Hey, cut it out! John!

14:21.280 --> 14:24.280
Johnny, I need your help.
Those two are killing each other.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.200
-You'd be nothing without me!
-Cut it out!

14:40.240 --> 14:42.520
Cut it out, guys! John!

14:43.400 --> 14:46.200
What? Goddamn it.

14:46.920 --> 14:47.840
What happened?

14:48.440 --> 14:50.480
Cut it out! Frank!

14:54.480 --> 14:55.920
Goddamn it.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.360
Guys!

15:02.440 --> 15:04.920
I'm done! Either you're out or I'm out.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.240
Go then, mate.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.480
-Leave!
-Shut it, Frank!

15:11.560 --> 15:12.640
Ramon!

15:12.720 --> 15:14.400
-Jesus. Are you okay?
-Leave me.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.720
<i>Maybe Leon was right.</i>

15:20.800 --> 15:22.160
It's okay. Steady.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.000
<i>Nobody would ever take me seriously</i>
<i>if I kept working in this madhouse.</i>

15:26.080 --> 15:28.480
-We have a problem.
-Yes, you can say that again.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.840
No, something else.
Dr. Simon from the Help line is sick.

15:33.760 --> 15:37.400
<i>But what would they do</i>
<i>without their only sexpert?</i>

15:40.200 --> 15:42.200
But what's important to remember

15:42.280 --> 15:45.680
is that 39 percent of all men
think their penis is too small.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.640
<i>Oh, really?</i>

15:46.720 --> 15:47.560
-Yes.
-<i>That many?</i>

15:47.640 --> 15:49.440
Exactly. That percentage indicates

15:49.520 --> 15:52.440
that all those men are actually
probably quite average in size.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.960
<i>-Okay.</i>
-It's also important to realize

15:55.040 --> 15:59.720
that you mainly see your penis from above,
which makes it seem significantly smaller.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.880
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

16:17.480 --> 16:19.760
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

16:27.920 --> 16:28.960
Frank.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.160
I'm

16:32.960 --> 16:34.040
thinking about leaving.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.120
The rats are leaving the ship.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.680
It's not that.

16:44.280 --> 16:45.920
I'm graduating soon.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.960
Yeah, what does a psychologist make
these days? 1,500? 2,000?

16:50.040 --> 16:51.400
Jesus, Frank.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.840
-It's not all about money.
-Of course it is.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.360
Why do you think we won the Cold War?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.120
Everything's about money.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.600
Will you and Ramon be okay?

17:07.920 --> 17:08.760
Of course.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.280
We're brothers.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.640
We'll find someone else.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.040
Natasja Stigter speaking.

17:53.000 --> 17:53.840
Hello?

17:58.280 --> 17:59.320
Frank.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.560
<i>I know it's you, Frank. I can hear you.</i>

18:06.240 --> 18:07.360
You've got to stop.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.200
<i>I'm not leaving Ramon,</i>
<i>especially not for you.</i>

18:56.760 --> 18:57.600
Thank you.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.920
Don't you have someone else
to do this for you?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.400
I didn't want to scare the kids.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.560
Sure.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.760
That's why you're here.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.080
I'd expected you sooner.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.720
-He got you pretty good.
-We used to do judo together.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.120
It helped Frank let his energy out.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.280
-I bet you didn't mind it.
-What do you mean?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.320
With all those boys.

19:28.240 --> 19:31.000
-That wasn't even on my mind yet.
-Sure.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.520
Pussy.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.040
Marly speaking.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.040
<i>Were you asleep?</i>

20:58.280 --> 21:00.720
No, I've just come out of the shower.

21:01.320 --> 21:06.040
-Are you coming over tonight?
-No, I've had quite a day.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.240
<i>Are you dressed?</i>

21:09.200 --> 21:10.600
No, not yet.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.600
<i>Are you naked?</i>

21:14.800 --> 21:16.960
No, I'm still wearing my bathrobe.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.280
Okay, take it off.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.120
<i>Is it off?</i>

21:24.640 --> 21:25.480
Yes.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.360
Say something to me.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.960
<i>The way you talk on those tapes.</i>

21:32.040 --> 21:35.840
-Leon, I told you that I--
-<i>Come on. Just for fun.</i>

21:39.680 --> 21:40.520
Okay.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.040
I…

21:48.640 --> 21:52.160
-I have an exquisite figure.
-<i>Yes.</i>

21:52.240 --> 21:55.440
-With beautiful, round--
-<i>Go on.</i>

21:57.000 --> 21:57.880
<i>Go on.</i>

21:58.800 --> 21:59.680
I…

22:00.880 --> 22:01.800
I let myself…

22:03.480 --> 22:05.880
-I climb onto your lap.
-Yes.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.800
-<i>Can you feel me?</i>
-Yes.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.400
I slowly lower myself down and…

22:12.600 --> 22:13.440
<i>Yes.</i>

22:15.560 --> 22:16.400
Leon.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.120
I'm calling it quits.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.760
-It's over.
-<i>No.</i>

22:23.560 --> 22:27.560
-No. Come on. Keep going.
-No, I mean, I don't feel it anymore.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.000
I haven't for a long time.

22:30.760 --> 22:31.800
<i>So, I…</i>

22:32.400 --> 22:35.440
-I'm calling it quits.
-<i>No.</i>

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
<i>It's getting dark.</i>

23:29.920 --> 23:33.880
We sneak off, away from the garden party.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.560
Nobody can know.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.800
<i>I wait for you at the back of the house.</i>

23:40.880 --> 23:43.360
<i>You startle me when you suddenly appear.</i>

23:44.240 --> 23:48.640
<i>Across the country road,</i>
<i>among the reeds, is a small jetty.</i>

23:50.240 --> 23:52.400
When it's done here, I'll move there.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.440
Has everyone got everything?
I'm not going back.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.360
I'm never going back.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.720
<i>You lie down on the jetty on your back,</i>
<i>and I unzip your trousers.</i>

24:17.320 --> 24:21.240
<i>I stand over you and pull up my dress,</i>

24:21.320 --> 24:26.760
<i>move my knickers to the side</i>
<i>and feel your hot dick slide inside me,</i>

24:26.840 --> 24:29.400
<i>and I feel it getting even harder.</i>

24:29.480 --> 24:32.600
<i>Harder and harder. Yes.</i>

24:33.600 --> 24:34.560
I love you.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.320
<i>I want to scream,</i>
<i>but I'm scared they'll hear us.</i>

24:39.400 --> 24:43.000
<i>And you fuck me even deeper and harder.</i>

24:43.080 --> 24:46.520
<i>And harder and I'm coming!</i>
<i>I'm coming! Fuck me!</i>

24:47.600 --> 24:48.880
<i>Yes! I'm coming!</i>

25:32.640 --> 25:35.000
-Frank.
-<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

26:24.440 --> 26:25.760
I'm going to tell her.

26:28.720 --> 26:29.720
Was I that good?

26:32.520 --> 26:33.360
I mean it.

26:46.920 --> 26:47.760
Daddy!

27:01.680 --> 27:04.280
-What happened?
-Frank and I are going our separate ways.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.120
What? Why?

27:06.800 --> 27:07.640
Why?

27:08.320 --> 27:10.160
Natas, you really don't want to know.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.800
Frank's made
the most God-awful mess of things.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.160
We have to pay back millions in taxes.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.720
That much? But…

27:21.240 --> 27:23.600
-That can't all be his fault, surely?
-It is.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.360
It was Frank's job to oversee the accounts
and he's spent way too much.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.600
Why would Frank be overseeing
the accounts? He doesn't know how.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.080
Frank is a manchild.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.120
He can't do this without you.
You said so yourself.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.720
So should I check the accounts, Natas?

27:37.800 --> 27:40.560
All those numbers,
it's like gibberish to me.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.240
But you have me. That's what I do.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.160
You two will get through this.

27:50.040 --> 27:50.880
Okay?

28:00.800 --> 28:01.840
And so will we.

28:13.800 --> 28:14.680
Natas.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.440
I…

28:18.520 --> 28:19.640
I'm pregnant.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.000
-Hey.
-Hey.

28:36.440 --> 28:40.080
-What do I smell?
-It's pom. Want to try?

28:44.360 --> 28:45.840
Finally something tasty.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.880
How was it?

28:49.040 --> 28:49.880
Well.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.440
Ew, it stinks in here.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.360
Was it fun?

28:53.440 --> 28:56.080
Yes, I'm worn out. I need to lie down.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.720
Me too.

29:03.720 --> 29:06.080
That's another wall
that came down in Berlin.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.400
-What?
-Yep.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.600
-I broke up with Leon.
-Really?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.720
Holy cow, that took a long time.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.200
Are you okay?

29:26.120 --> 29:27.040
As promised.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.800
-Wow.
-A piece of the wall.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.000
God, those two
are so insufferable together.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.000
It would have been
so much more fun if you'd come along.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.600
Sorry.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.200
-Would you like some?
-Yes, please.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.960
Rachel comes…

29:59.040 --> 30:00.800
Rather loudly.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.400
<i>It was the end of the 1980s.</i>

30:12.480 --> 30:16.080
<i>The start of the final decade</i>
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

30:17.680 --> 30:20.680
<i>And what I remember most of all</i>
<i>is the sense of optimism.</i>

30:21.280 --> 30:24.680
<i>The fall of the wall</i>
<i>had people dreaming of world peace.</i>

30:25.480 --> 30:29.560
<i>It gave them hope that you could be happy</i>
<i>as long as you were successful.</i>

30:31.120 --> 30:33.680
<i>But you can't take</i>
<i>anything in life for granted.</i>

30:35.120 --> 30:38.360
<i>Since his argument with Ramon,</i>
<i>Frank had stayed away from the office.</i>

30:39.200 --> 30:42.960
<i>And it seemed like</i>
<i>the company's best years were behind it.</i>

30:43.040 --> 30:44.680
FOR SALE

30:44.760 --> 30:49.360
-Has your Ferrari been stolen?
-Yeah, man. Bunch of criminals.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.800
Luckily, the insurance
will pay me back every penny.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.920
So I can pass it straight on to Anouk.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.160
Yeah. Sorry about the mess.

30:56.720 --> 30:58.040
I have to get on with it.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.960
The movers will be here
after New Year's Eve.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.720
-You're not moving back into the office?
-No, of course not.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.600
-That's no place for a child.
-No.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.160
I now get Django every other weekend.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.720
Tsjibbe still has
an apartment above 't Rijk.

31:14.560 --> 31:15.840
How is it at the office?

31:20.320 --> 31:21.520
I fired Uncle Jaap.

31:23.920 --> 31:27.640
Yeah. It turns out it wasn't just
your fault there was no money.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.120
Yes.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.440
<i>Jaap Das was goodness personified.</i>

31:36.240 --> 31:37.880
Two hundred and fifty.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.320
And 25 extra for being such a sweetie.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.120
How sweet of you.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.800
<i>Bharati from the Snore line</i>
<i>instantly recognized</i>

31:47.880 --> 31:50.920
<i>that she was dealing</i>
<i>with a good and caring person.</i>

31:51.000 --> 31:54.960
<i>So it wasn't long before Uncle Jaap</i>
<i>joined the Bhagwan movement.</i>

31:57.080 --> 32:00.200
<i>The Sannyasins,</i>
<i>as Bhagwan's followers were known,</i>

32:00.280 --> 32:03.680
<i>had their own club in Amsterdam,</i>
<i>Zorba de Buddha.</i>

32:03.760 --> 32:06.600
<i>And they were the first</i>
<i>large-scale importers of ecstasy.</i>

32:07.120 --> 32:10.440
<i>But after the government</i>
<i>banned MDMA in November 1988,</i>

32:10.520 --> 32:12.320
<i>they had a serious budget deficit.</i>

32:12.840 --> 32:16.480
<i>A deficit that could partly be covered</i>
<i>by their latest Sannyasin.</i>

32:16.560 --> 32:17.720
-Thanks.
-<i>Uncle Jaap Das.</i>

32:17.800 --> 32:20.480
<i>Or Shankar Putri,</i>
<i>as he preferred to be known henceforth.</i>

32:20.560 --> 32:24.400
What happened to your clothes?
Did you leave a red sock in the wash?

32:25.440 --> 32:26.280
Here.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.240
<i>Who, because no one</i>
<i>was checking the books,</i>

32:29.320 --> 32:32.280
<i>managed to transfer over a million</i>
<i>into the movement's accounts.</i>

32:33.600 --> 32:36.800
<i>Which they put to excellent use.</i>

32:38.200 --> 32:39.680
-Japie?
-Hey, Ramon.

32:39.760 --> 32:44.440
Hey, Natas went over the books yesterday.
Do you have a minute?

32:44.520 --> 32:45.960
Yes, of course. Sit down.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.560
-Would you like a coffee first?
-Yes, please.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.920
<i>And that was the last</i>
<i>we ever saw of Uncle Jaap.</i>

32:57.000 --> 32:58.360
Uncle Jaap?

32:58.880 --> 33:02.040
I reported it to the police,
but he's in India.

33:03.120 --> 33:04.880
Jesus. Rat.

33:05.960 --> 33:08.200
-Found anyone else yet?
-I was thinking Natas.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.360
Yes.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.760
Natas. Yes.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.000
She's the one who negotiated
our payment scheme with the IRS.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.600
If we keep close tabs on our expenses,
we'll be right as rain in a year.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.240
Do I still get a say
in any of this or not?

33:27.320 --> 33:29.640
-Do you have any objections?
-No.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.720
No. Of course not. Great.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.800
Well, it's just a temporary solution
until the baby arrives.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.200
Baby?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.680
-Yes.
-What do you mean, baby?

33:43.600 --> 33:44.800
Didn't you know?

33:44.880 --> 33:47.040
I thought our wives
always told you everything.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.560
We're expecting a third.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
Man!

33:56.000 --> 33:57.600
Now you tell me. Hey.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.600
Jesus.

34:00.760 --> 34:01.880
Congratulations.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.040
-Thank you.
-How wonderful.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.280
Yeah, isn't it great?

34:06.600 --> 34:08.680
-We should celebrate, right?
-Yes.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.400
Hey, I was thinking,

34:13.160 --> 34:17.080
isn't it about time
we took our expertise abroad?

34:17.640 --> 34:20.040
Sweden and Switzerland
are opening their markets

34:20.120 --> 34:21.280
to commercial telephony.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.680
Spain and Italy have already done so.

34:24.200 --> 34:28.080
-So you want to get back to work then?
-Yes, of course I do.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.440
All my affairs are back in order.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.160
So I'm ready to go. Here.

34:35.920 --> 34:36.920
What do you say?

34:38.440 --> 34:40.840
I think we should appoint
a business director.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.040
Business director?

34:44.040 --> 34:45.200
But that's me.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.520
Someone to focus on the Netherlands.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.640
So you can venture abroad.
I've already discussed it with John.

34:56.680 --> 34:57.520
So…

34:57.600 --> 34:59.960
Did you have someone in mind?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.520
<i>I was unaware of their plans,</i>

35:04.600 --> 35:08.320
<i>and frankly I had no intention</i>
<i>of becoming director of Teledutch.</i>

35:08.400 --> 35:10.840
<i>I was more focused</i>
<i>on my final-year thesis,</i>

35:10.920 --> 35:14.360
<i>which had been given new life</i>
<i>due to a recent invention,</i>

35:14.440 --> 35:16.880
<i>the vaginal photoplethysmograph.</i>

35:16.960 --> 35:21.000
Shouldn't we try it out on ourselves
before we insert it into other people?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.800
There.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.400
Yes.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.040
Could you perhaps…

35:29.880 --> 35:31.720
-You're such a prude.
-Just go.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.160
I'll go for a piss.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.840
<i>The purpose</i>
<i>of the vaginal photoplethysmograph</i>

35:36.920 --> 35:40.040
<i>was to measure</i>
<i>moisture levels inside the vagina</i>

35:40.120 --> 35:42.800
<i>while the subject</i>
<i>was looking at explicit sexual images.</i>

35:43.920 --> 35:47.320
<i>The machine registers, before you do,</i>

35:47.400 --> 35:49.000
<i>whether you're getting turned on.</i>

35:50.440 --> 35:54.040
I don't see the meter moving yet,
but maybe it takes a while.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.640
Okay.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.520
Jesus, Leon.

36:01.280 --> 36:05.400
Your hypothesis is,
the genital response is generated sooner

36:06.160 --> 36:07.440
by female-oriented porn.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.320
Can you explain that?

36:10.920 --> 36:12.240
No. Go away.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.920
No. I'm still your supervisor.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.840
We think that men
are more easily turned on by porn

36:22.920 --> 36:25.920
because the sex focuses
mainly on stimulation of the penis.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.680
<i>It turned out to be different.</i>

36:28.760 --> 36:33.480
Women also get an automatic
genital response when watching porn,

36:33.560 --> 36:36.520
except the signal
is not transmitted to the brain.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.400
Yes, because we don't experience
the sex as realistic.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.600
-Exactly.
-Yes. Long story, but believe me,

36:41.680 --> 36:45.840
it was a major breakthrough
in research into female sexuality.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.080
Marly. Could you please… Can't we just…

36:52.480 --> 36:56.160
The setup looks promising.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.560
Just make sure
you have a representative control group.

36:59.640 --> 37:00.720
Ladies.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.760
Hey? What did he want?

37:08.280 --> 37:11.200
I think we need
to look for another supervisor.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.480
Excellent idea.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.600
<i>And then it was 31 December, 1989.</i>

37:20.320 --> 37:22.800
<i>For everyone,</i>
<i>it felt like a new beginning.</i>

37:23.680 --> 37:25.520
<i>The end of an era.</i>

37:27.920 --> 37:31.800
<i>We'd all become one</i>
<i>if only we partied hard enough.</i>

37:35.360 --> 37:37.480
<i>And this was my first little pill.</i>

37:40.720 --> 37:44.360
<i>I was so happy</i>
<i>the depressing 1980s were over.</i>

37:45.680 --> 37:47.240
<i>Just like everyone at the RoXY,</i>

37:47.320 --> 37:49.960
<i>I finally felt free</i>
<i>to be who I wanted to be.</i>

37:52.560 --> 37:57.200
<i>I was going to graduate, get my PhD,</i>
<i>and become a world-renowned sexologist.</i>

37:57.280 --> 38:00.920
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

38:01.000 --> 38:03.840
six, five, four,

38:03.920 --> 38:07.080
three, two, one…

38:10.040 --> 38:13.040
-Hey, DJ! Music!
-Oh, yes.

38:18.960 --> 38:22.200
Happy New Year! I love you guys, man!

38:22.800 --> 38:25.520
-Mar, this is going to be our decade!
-Yes!

38:27.920 --> 38:30.880
<i>Look, in retrospect,</i>
<i>I shouldn't have taken that pill.</i>

38:32.440 --> 38:36.040
<i>And looking back, there were other things</i>
<i>I should've done differently.</i>

38:36.560 --> 38:39.200
<i>And that we all</i>
<i>should have done differently.</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:43.640
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.080
-Did Ramon call you?
-No.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.880
We want to offer you a job.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.480
<i>But in the moment,</i>
<i>it all just seemed so great.</i>

38:55.880 --> 38:58.040
<i>So great.</i>

41:39.720 --> 41:44.240
<i>I can feel it throbbing,</i>
<i>and I rub it against my wet pussy.</i>

41:45.240 --> 41:48.280
<i>You grab my butt cheeks</i>
<i>and pull them apart.</i>

41:49.920 --> 41:54.920
<i>I lower myself onto you</i>
<i>and feel your hot dick slide inside me,</i>

41:55.000 --> 41:57.760
<i>and I feel it getting even harder.</i>

42:00.520 --> 42:02.520
<i>I ride you like a pony,</i>

42:03.080 --> 42:04.400
<i>harder and harder.</i>

42:05.080 --> 42:05.920
<i>Yes.</i>

42:07.440 --> 42:08.280
<i>Yes.</i>

42:09.720 --> 42:12.920
<i>I want to scream,</i>
<i>but I'm scared they'll hear us.</i>

42:13.000 --> 42:15.280
<i>You put your hand over my mouth</i>

42:15.360 --> 42:18.520
<i>and fuck me even deeper and harder.</i>

42:19.880 --> 42:22.560
<i>And harder and harder. I'm coming!</i>

42:22.640 --> 42:25.160
<i>I'm coming! Fuck me!</i>

42:28.000 --> 42:28.840
<i>I'm coming!</i>

42:28.920 --> 42:31.920
