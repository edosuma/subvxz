WEBVTT

00:00.635 --> 00:03.039
25, 30, 35,

00:03.040 --> 00:06.843
40, 45, 50.

00:06.844 --> 00:08.845
Sean, that is far too much money.

00:08.846 --> 00:10.406
Our daily rate is $10, which we would

00:10.407 --> 00:12.082
cut in half for a
student like yourself.

00:12.083 --> 00:15.785
I will eat rice and beans
every day. Please, I insist.

00:15.787 --> 00:18.955
Plus another 50
when you find my pocket watch.

00:18.956 --> 00:21.791
How can we identify it if...
rather, when we find it?

00:21.793 --> 00:24.094
It's silver with
a phoenix design on the back.

00:24.095 --> 00:26.863
- And where did you lose it?
- Oh, I didn't lose it.

00:26.864 --> 00:29.766
It was stolen from me.
These street kids,

00:29.767 --> 00:30.955
I gave 'em a few nickels and...

00:30.956 --> 00:32.969
Next thing you know, chain's
broken and pocket's empty.

00:32.970 --> 00:35.572
- That's exactly what happened.
- Was this around

00:35.573 --> 00:37.741
- Parliament and Gerrard?
- Yes, how did you know?

00:37.742 --> 00:40.644
There's a gang of street urchins
who run that part of town.

00:40.645 --> 00:43.813
- They're infamous.
- And prolific.

00:43.815 --> 00:46.216
Shall we take a little walk?

00:46.217 --> 00:48.351
It's a beautiful day for a pickpocket.

00:50.290 --> 00:51.548
Stop!

00:54.826 --> 00:56.326
It wasn't me!

00:56.327 --> 00:58.562
Talk to the guy in the park!

01:06.404 --> 01:08.438
We're looking for a watch.

01:12.076 --> 01:13.931
But the guy in the park said he was

01:13.932 --> 01:15.812
raising money for his sick sister.

01:15.813 --> 01:17.814
You didn't notice
he was selling a glass eye?

01:17.815 --> 01:21.351
- I thought maybe it was hers.
- Can we see the watch?

01:21.352 --> 01:23.386
Uh...

01:23.387 --> 01:25.488
Well, see, that's the thing.

01:28.993 --> 01:31.094
I lost it.

01:31.095 --> 01:34.264
This watch has nine lives.
Where did you lose it?

01:34.265 --> 01:36.666
Uh, on the street somewhere.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.302
If you're gonna lie,
you could at least try harder.

01:39.303 --> 01:42.939
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Wife's at home, isn't she?

01:42.940 --> 01:45.542
You're right. Maybe we should
talk to her about it.

01:47.645 --> 01:50.113
I lost the watch in a bet.

01:50.114 --> 01:52.215
I was playing blackjack.
Please don't tell my wife.

01:52.216 --> 01:54.551
You know, gambling's
illegal in this city.

01:54.552 --> 01:56.453
You should be worried about us
telling the cops, let alone

01:56.454 --> 01:59.189
- your wife.
- You give us an address,

01:59.190 --> 02:01.658
no one has to know anything.

02:01.659 --> 02:03.660
You'll need a password to get in.

02:09.032 --> 02:11.201
Password.

02:11.202 --> 02:13.937
Dealer's choice.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.641
No one gets in without a pat down.

02:17.642 --> 02:20.610
- Hands above your head.
- A gun problem in this place?

02:20.611 --> 02:24.614
Cashier's cage is in the back.
No credit, no funny business.

02:24.615 --> 02:26.616
So what do you think
is gonna get us the watch back?

02:26.617 --> 02:30.520
- Grandmother sob story?
- Or "my husband bet a family heirloom."

02:30.521 --> 02:33.623
You're gonna have to do better
than that, Frankie Drake.

02:35.826 --> 02:37.694
Bessie Starkman.

02:37.695 --> 02:40.497
Illegal gambling, overzealous
security. I should have known

02:40.498 --> 02:43.066
this was your joint. I love
what you've done with the place.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.571
Thought I told you to steer clear

02:44.572 --> 02:46.236
of me, yet you just keep popping up

02:46.237 --> 02:47.347
where you're least expected.

02:47.348 --> 02:49.239
Guess I just like the
element of surprise.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.741
- What do you want?
- We've been hired to find

02:51.742 --> 02:53.142
a silver pocket watch. Seems it was

02:53.143 --> 02:54.778
lost at one of your blackjack tables.

02:54.779 --> 02:57.981
I remember that chump.
He bet it on a pair of sevens.

02:57.982 --> 03:00.617
- The watch is gone.
- Where is it?

03:00.618 --> 03:02.419
You ask too many questions.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.688
You know who else asks
a lot of questions?

03:04.689 --> 03:08.525
- The police.
- Is that supposed to scare me?

03:08.526 --> 03:10.827
Half the force come in
here to shoot craps.

03:14.465 --> 03:16.466
We know.

03:16.467 --> 03:19.035
I have lots of photos
of Toronto's Finest

03:19.036 --> 03:21.037
in this very underground casino.

03:21.038 --> 03:23.306
Now, how would that look
if those pictures

03:23.307 --> 03:27.577
were splashed across
the front page of the newspaper.

03:27.578 --> 03:31.381
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

03:31.382 --> 03:33.917
You wanna stake the future
of your casino on that?

03:33.918 --> 03:36.753
You two have got some kind of nerve

03:36.754 --> 03:39.222
coming in here and threatening
me in my own joint.

03:39.223 --> 03:40.963
No one's threatening anyone.
Just hand over

03:40.964 --> 03:42.592
the watch and we'll
be on our merry way.

03:42.593 --> 03:45.395
When I said the watch is gone,
I meant it's gone.

03:45.396 --> 03:47.430
Along with all my clients' money

03:47.431 --> 03:50.400
on the tables and in the cage.
Their wallets,

03:50.401 --> 03:52.936
- their jewelry...
- Someone knocked over your casino.

03:52.937 --> 03:55.305
- Yeah.
- When?

03:55.306 --> 03:58.408
A few nights ago.
It's been real bad for business.

03:58.409 --> 04:01.611
My customers are getting
skittish. Even my regulars.

04:01.612 --> 04:05.448
- Maybe we can help each other.
- We're looking for our client's watch.

04:05.449 --> 04:07.584
You need to restore
the reputation of your casino,

04:07.585 --> 04:10.754
so why don't you hire us
to investigate the robbery.

04:10.755 --> 04:13.156
You think I don't
already have people on it?

04:13.157 --> 04:16.426
You think they're as good as we are?

04:16.427 --> 04:19.829
OK. I accept your offer.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.998
Did you get a look
at the men who robbed you?

04:21.999 --> 04:25.135
They were wearing disguises.
Masks and robes.

04:25.136 --> 04:26.770
How did they get guns past security?

04:26.771 --> 04:28.738
I had my two best guys
working that night.

04:28.739 --> 04:32.542
They were both standing directly outside
the front door, booting out a cheater.

04:32.543 --> 04:34.911
- Any other entrances?
- I got a back door

04:34.912 --> 04:37.046
I always keep locked. So maybe

04:37.048 --> 04:38.882
one guy comes in the front door
with his pockets empty...

04:38.883 --> 04:42.185
And then he unlocks
the back door for his partner

04:42.186 --> 04:44.020
so he gets in with
the guns and disguises.

04:44.021 --> 04:47.223
Someone must have seen that.
Will your employees talk with us?

04:47.224 --> 04:49.559
They're probably more likely
to talk if they think

04:49.560 --> 04:51.227
- we're working for you.
- Yeah.

04:51.228 --> 04:54.397
They think I hired you,
they'll trust you enough.

04:54.398 --> 04:56.466
I've got space
for another cocktail waitress,

04:56.467 --> 04:58.902
and one of my blackjack
dealers just...

04:58.903 --> 05:00.904
Well, let's just say
he went on "vacation."

05:00.905 --> 05:04.007
- What kind of vacation?
- The permanent kind.

05:04.008 --> 05:06.009
So don't get caught with your hands

05:06.010 --> 05:07.811
- in the cookie jar.
- No one dies, Bessie.

05:07.812 --> 05:09.746
Examples need to be made.

05:09.747 --> 05:11.581
No one dies.

05:13.651 --> 05:15.585
Do you see this urn?

05:15.586 --> 05:19.422
It contains my mother's ashes.

05:19.423 --> 05:22.025
She was my greatest inspiration.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.499
Now, if I'm willing
to do that to my own mother,

05:29.500 --> 05:33.603
imagine what I'll do to you
if you try to double-cross me.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.672
Got the message?

05:35.673 --> 05:39.275
Loud and clear.

05:42.343 --> 05:49.185
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

05:49.186 --> 05:51.354
Safe to say I'll be
serving the drinks.

05:51.355 --> 05:53.790
Dealing cards seems more
like a Frankie Drake job.

05:53.791 --> 05:57.026
Oh, so you're a shark, huh?

05:57.027 --> 05:59.562
Actually, I'm all thumbs.

05:59.563 --> 06:01.598
Why don't you give it a try.

06:01.599 --> 06:03.633
OK.

06:07.571 --> 06:10.106
You've done this before?

06:10.107 --> 06:12.175
Ronnie!

06:12.176 --> 06:15.745
I got a new blackjack dealer
I'd like you to train.

06:15.746 --> 06:18.281
- You the dealer?
- Let's play some cards.

06:18.282 --> 06:21.084
Fresh deck.

06:24.421 --> 06:27.991
Lets the player know you can
shuffle a clean deck of cards.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.998
Got it? Hmm?

06:36.000 --> 06:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:47.711 --> 06:50.680
18, stick. 13, hit.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.649
9, bust.

06:52.650 --> 06:55.818
20, stick. 14, hit.

06:55.820 --> 06:57.453
6, 20.

06:57.454 --> 06:58.988
And 17, stick.

06:58.989 --> 07:01.491
Dealer.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.259
14, hit.

07:03.260 --> 07:05.528
2, 16, hit.

07:05.529 --> 07:08.364
5, that's 21. Dealer wins.

07:08.365 --> 07:11.067
Now you.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.627
17, stick.

07:37.628 --> 07:40.163
20, stick. 12, hit.

07:40.164 --> 07:42.165
7, that's stick.

07:42.166 --> 07:45.001
18, stick. 15, hit.

07:45.002 --> 07:47.337
7 is a bust.

07:47.338 --> 07:49.372
Dealer has 14. Hit.

07:49.373 --> 07:51.874
6 makes 20, dealer wins.

07:51.876 --> 07:53.676
She's a natural!

07:53.677 --> 07:56.012
Not bad. Ronnie?

07:56.013 --> 07:59.215
I can work with this. We've got rules.

07:59.216 --> 08:01.751
Don't talk to the customers
unless they talk to you first.

08:01.752 --> 08:04.020
Watch for cheaters.
And don't ever deal

08:04.021 --> 08:06.055
- from the bottom of the deck.
- Right.

08:06.056 --> 08:08.224
- Dealer's way of cheating.
- Customers think we're cheating

08:08.225 --> 08:10.226
- they'll never come back.
- We need them to keep

08:10.227 --> 08:11.928
coming back so we can
keep taking their money.

08:11.929 --> 08:15.431
- I like her already.
- Don't get carried away.

08:15.432 --> 08:18.735
I need you to get these two kitted up.

08:18.736 --> 08:20.770
We start at 7 p.m. sharp.

08:20.771 --> 08:22.839
Gamblers aren't gonna know
what hit 'em.

08:26.710 --> 08:28.945
Is this a bad idea, Frankie?
Bessie Starkman

08:28.946 --> 08:31.047
- sounds terrifying.
- Terrifying?

08:31.048 --> 08:34.049
You should see Trudy deal
blackjack. She's deadly.

08:34.051 --> 08:35.217
You're coming with me
to my bridge game next week.

08:35.219 --> 08:37.320
We're gonna clean up.

08:37.321 --> 08:39.856
Who knew 15 years of cribbage
with Momma would pay off?

08:39.857 --> 08:42.091
So while we're trying
to track down the robbers,

08:42.092 --> 08:44.260
why don't two see
if you can find Sean's watch.

08:44.260 --> 08:46.262
Where do you think we should look?

08:46.263 --> 08:47.644
Safe bet the robbers hocked the watch

08:47.645 --> 08:48.965
along with the rest of the jewelry.

08:48.966 --> 08:50.700
Why don't you check
the local pawn shops.

08:50.701 --> 08:53.202
I pass by those type
of establishments on my rounds.

08:53.203 --> 08:57.073
- They seem quite seedy.
- Nothing we can't handle.

08:57.074 --> 08:59.642
Good? Hahaha!

09:01.912 --> 09:03.913
Everybody is so focused
on the gambling,

09:03.914 --> 09:05.915
it should be easy to get information.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.917
- You can get them liquored up.
- Vernon Asheton.

09:07.918 --> 09:10.720
Head of security. On this floor,
my word is the law.

09:10.721 --> 09:12.855
Bar is over here, sweetheart.

09:14.725 --> 09:17.060
Keep your eyes open for cheaters.

09:17.061 --> 09:19.062
Alright, card counting, chip skimming.

09:19.063 --> 09:20.436
Your job to spot the cheaters.

09:20.437 --> 09:22.565
I see anything shady,
I'll call you over.

09:22.566 --> 09:25.735
No. Keep it discreet.
If you see someone cheating,

09:25.736 --> 09:28.004
just tug on your ear.

09:28.005 --> 09:30.106
- New dealer.
- Spin that thing

09:30.107 --> 09:31.941
a little faster.

09:31.942 --> 09:34.977
I'll double up on this one.

09:34.979 --> 09:37.246
Look at that one. Here we go.

09:41.151 --> 09:43.453
- 15.
- Hit.

09:43.454 --> 09:46.022
24. Bust.

09:50.928 --> 09:53.830
- 19.
- Stick.

09:53.831 --> 09:56.699
You have a light, pal?

09:56.700 --> 09:59.168
Muldoon's Grille. Tell you something,

09:59.169 --> 10:01.971
- I named that joint.
- You named it? Get outta here.

10:01.972 --> 10:04.173
I work there. I'm a waiter.

10:04.174 --> 10:06.976
- Dealer has 20.
- I told the owner, your boss,

10:06.977 --> 10:08.627
"No disrespect, but
no one wants to eat

10:08.628 --> 10:10.325
at a joint called Wilson's Good Eats."

10:15.386 --> 10:17.787
- 13.
- Hit me.

10:17.788 --> 10:20.123
So I told him,

10:20.124 --> 10:22.625
you need to call it Muldoon's Grille.

10:22.626 --> 10:25.061
- It's real classy, huh?
- It's real classy.

10:25.062 --> 10:26.829
3. 16.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.231
Hit me.

10:28.232 --> 10:31.501
- Where are you from?
- 7.

10:31.502 --> 10:34.170
- It's 23.
- Table's cold.

10:38.075 --> 10:40.943
- 15.
- Hit me.

10:42.146 --> 10:44.580
King of diamonds. 25.

10:47.484 --> 10:49.919
Hey!

10:49.920 --> 10:53.055
- Hands to yourself!
- This is Charles Kanaskie.

10:53.057 --> 10:55.258
He's a regular. And in my joint,

10:55.259 --> 10:58.060
there are guys you can slap
and guys you can't.

10:58.062 --> 11:01.664
Mr. Kanaskie is a guy you can't.

11:01.665 --> 11:04.333
Pleasure's all yours.

11:04.334 --> 11:06.602
- What are you drinking, Chuck?
- Scotch.

11:06.603 --> 11:08.738
- Neat.
- On the house.

11:08.739 --> 11:11.274
And if she gives you any more
trouble, you let me know.

11:11.275 --> 11:15.077
Don't worry, Red. I ain't mad at ya.

11:15.079 --> 11:17.180
- I'll fetch you that Scotch.
- In fact,

11:17.181 --> 11:19.182
I actually kinda like you.

11:19.183 --> 11:22.552
You're a bit of a firecracker.
I could use a gal like you.

11:22.553 --> 11:24.520
I'm in imports and exports,

11:24.521 --> 11:27.924
but I got my fingers
in lots of pies. Tell you what,

11:27.925 --> 11:30.293
you give me a call

11:30.294 --> 11:32.395
whenever you feel like you're ready

11:32.396 --> 11:34.397
to move up to the big time.

11:40.637 --> 11:44.807
Not a chance, Chuck.

11:47.678 --> 11:50.446
Dear! No, we're closed. No, no.

11:50.447 --> 11:52.481
I promise we won't
take much of your time.

11:52.483 --> 11:54.050
No, I don't want to hear about it, no.

11:54.051 --> 11:55.187
We're looking for the perfect pocket

11:55.188 --> 11:56.252
watch for my father's birthday.

11:56.253 --> 11:58.154
And we've been to seven
pawn shops already.

11:58.155 --> 12:01.490
Eight, when we go to
Mitchell's across the street.

12:01.492 --> 12:04.126
Mitchell's? No, no, no.

12:04.128 --> 12:06.429
The pocket watches
are right over there.

12:06.430 --> 12:09.665
No. No. No. Holy moly, Mary,

12:09.666 --> 12:11.434
I think that's it. Can we have
that one right there?

12:11.435 --> 12:14.570
- This one?
- Turn it over.

12:14.571 --> 12:17.240
What luck!

12:17.241 --> 12:19.475
Ma'am, are you aware
that this watch was stolen

12:19.476 --> 12:21.511
from an illegal blackjack table
during an armed robbery?

12:21.512 --> 12:23.112
Alright. Out, you go! Out!

12:23.113 --> 12:25.748
Ma'am, I'm an officer
of the law. Morality division.

12:25.749 --> 12:27.850
Shall I call the detective
down at my station?

12:27.851 --> 12:30.453
Sure they could find bucket
loads of contraband in here.

12:30.454 --> 12:34.156
Oh, fine! 50% off then
and happy birthday to Pops.

12:34.158 --> 12:36.225
- You're not getting one cent!
- And we'll need

12:36.226 --> 12:38.661
the seller's name because he was
probably one of the robbers.

12:38.662 --> 12:41.831
Well, it's not here.
It's in the ledger,

12:41.832 --> 12:43.660
and the owner took it home.
So I'm sorry,

12:43.661 --> 12:45.434
but you'll have to come back tomorrow.

12:45.435 --> 12:49.372
Count on seeing us tomorrow.

12:49.373 --> 12:52.942
Mary, did Frankie say anything
about the client being Chinese?

12:52.943 --> 12:56.345
- His name is Sean Murphy.
- Definitely not.

12:56.346 --> 12:58.914
So why is the inscription
in Chinese lettering? Strange.

12:58.916 --> 13:01.183
This watch has a story to tell.

13:06.490 --> 13:09.058
- Give me another whiskey sour.
- 48 cents.

13:09.059 --> 13:12.295
No. It's on the house, Leo.

13:12.296 --> 13:15.531
That's what I thought.

13:15.532 --> 13:17.466
- You know Ronnie?
- Sure, he's the floor manager.

13:17.467 --> 13:19.235
Leo's his cousin, so Leo don't pay.

13:19.236 --> 13:21.504
Got it. Hey, I heard

13:21.505 --> 13:24.473
I missed a lot of excitement
the other night.

13:24.474 --> 13:27.376
- Were you here for the robbery?
- You should have seen the masks.

13:27.377 --> 13:29.203
But you must have
had a front-row seat.

13:29.204 --> 13:30.846
Did they come in through that door?

13:30.847 --> 13:32.748
Nah. I was right here
when it happened. If they came

13:32.749 --> 13:35.084
- in that door, I'd have seen 'em.
- So where did they come from?

13:35.085 --> 13:38.187
- Ain't you got a job to do?
- Just curious.

13:38.188 --> 13:40.256
Be curious about serving drinks.

13:40.257 --> 13:42.437
We got a winner!
We got a big winner here!

13:44.428 --> 13:46.195
New deck.

13:47.931 --> 13:49.932
They didn't come
through the back door.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.867
There's no other entrance. How
did they get the guns inside?

13:51.868 --> 13:53.736
That's what we need to find out.

13:53.737 --> 13:56.739
Toots! We need more gin.

13:56.740 --> 14:00.176
Hit the back room and grab some. Fast.

14:09.052 --> 14:11.921
That's 21.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.889
Well, that's it for me.

14:13.890 --> 14:16.192
Nice job, new girl.

14:16.193 --> 14:18.894
Be seeing you.
Everyone else, new game.

14:18.895 --> 14:20.730
- I saw that.
- Saw what?

14:20.731 --> 14:22.343
You cheating on last four hands.
Let's go!

14:22.344 --> 14:23.399
I don't even jaywalk!

14:23.400 --> 14:24.934
Yeah, yeah. Tell it
to the pavement. Let's go!

14:24.935 --> 14:27.570
Put your hands in the air
and shut your mouths!

14:32.242 --> 14:34.777
Next guy who wants to try me
will get a bullet in his skull.

14:34.778 --> 14:36.412
You mooks trying this again?

14:36.413 --> 14:38.948
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

14:38.949 --> 14:41.384
Yeah. A dead woman
if you don't stop talking.

14:41.385 --> 14:43.386
- Frankie!
- Not this time I'm afraid.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.958
Fine.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.826
What the hell?!

14:55.565 --> 14:58.534
Hey!

15:00.904 --> 15:02.671
Are you OK?

15:02.673 --> 15:05.541
Yeah. How did you know
the gun wasn't loaded?

15:15.723 --> 15:17.891
Have a seat.

15:19.527 --> 15:22.395
- Who's that?
- My bubbe.

15:22.396 --> 15:24.597
How many dead relatives do you have?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.735
Now, I don't like being in the dark,

15:28.736 --> 15:32.505
especially in my own casino,
so you are going

15:32.506 --> 15:34.774
to walk me through what happened step

15:34.775 --> 15:37.944
by step.

15:37.945 --> 15:40.780
The bartender asked me
to go get some more gin.

15:40.781 --> 15:43.118
Toots! We need more gin.
Hit the back room

15:43.119 --> 15:45.420
and grab some. Fast.

15:45.421 --> 15:46.806
We had just figured out that the

15:46.807 --> 15:48.590
robbers didn't come
in through the back.

15:48.591 --> 15:50.825
But they couldn't have
come in with guns

15:50.826 --> 15:52.694
through the front door past security.

15:52.695 --> 15:55.463
Then I saw the employee
bathroom, which made me realize

15:55.464 --> 15:59.034
employees are never checked when
they come in through the front door.

15:59.035 --> 16:01.436
So I went back to the bathroom,
took a look around

16:01.437 --> 16:03.672
and sure enough, I found two masks,

16:03.673 --> 16:06.174
two robes and two guns.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.777
Which leads me to two points.
Number one is

16:08.778 --> 16:11.479
don't provide lockers that
your staff can hide things in.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.948
Thanks. I'll take that
under advisement.

16:13.950 --> 16:16.284
- Point number two?
- You have a mole.

16:19.322 --> 16:21.489
Haha! I keep

16:21.490 --> 16:24.292
a very close eye on my organization.

16:24.293 --> 16:26.795
If I have a mole, I deal with them.

16:26.796 --> 16:28.475
Well then, explain
to me how they walked

16:28.476 --> 16:29.998
through the front door as customers?

16:29.999 --> 16:32.334
Then slipped into the bathroom
and grabbed their firepower.

16:32.335 --> 16:33.452
How did the guns get there?

16:33.453 --> 16:35.527
They had to have been smuggled
in by someone with access.

16:35.528 --> 16:39.007
- Someone who works here.
- In other words, I have a mole.

16:39.008 --> 16:42.310
You're not gonna smash
another urn, are you?

16:46.249 --> 16:49.818
You two are detectives, so detect.

16:55.324 --> 16:57.726
So we're on a mole hunt. Any ideas?

16:57.727 --> 17:00.161
I got one. Did you notice
the exact same thing

17:00.162 --> 17:02.163
- happened before each robbery?
- Sure, the robbers went

17:02.164 --> 17:04.598
into the bathroom to collect
the guns that they stashed.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.734
No, before all that.
A gambler was caught cheating

17:06.736 --> 17:08.770
and thrown out by security.
Happened both times.

17:08.771 --> 17:10.672
- Coincidence?
- What do you always say?

17:10.673 --> 17:12.773
There's no such thing
as a coincidence.

17:12.775 --> 17:14.843
So you think the cheater
is part of the plan?

17:14.844 --> 17:17.512
I think it was a planned
distraction to get security outside.

17:17.512 --> 17:19.573
And the robbers
worked from the inside.

17:19.574 --> 17:21.415
So whoever staged the distraction...

17:21.416 --> 17:23.685
- Is working with the robbers.
- We find him, we find our mole.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.787
- But how?
- The "cheater" in question

17:25.788 --> 17:27.468
was pulled from my
table, but the thing

17:27.469 --> 17:29.057
is I never pulled the cheater sign.

17:29.058 --> 17:31.359
- Who did?
- He did.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.962
Vernon Asheton. Head of security.

17:33.963 --> 17:36.431
That was a hell of a brave
thing you did back there, Red.

17:36.432 --> 17:38.500
- Stupid, but brave.
- I'm working, Mr. Kanaskie.

17:38.501 --> 17:41.536
You should be working for me.
Don't forget to call.

17:41.537 --> 17:43.805
That was amazing, Vernon.
How did you spot the cheater?

17:43.806 --> 17:46.641
I see the guy slipping extra chips
into his bet whenever he won.

17:46.642 --> 17:48.877
You saw that all the way
across the room?

17:48.878 --> 17:52.247
Get back to work, the both of ya.

17:52.248 --> 17:55.250
It's simply not possible.
There must be some mistake.

17:55.251 --> 17:57.285
You know, maybe... maybe
we should go talk to Bessie.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.506
No. Just forget about it.

17:58.507 --> 18:01.589
But if there was a mistake,
Bessie should know about it.

18:01.590 --> 18:03.858
- Let's go talk to her.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

18:05.594 --> 18:07.529
Ahem! Let's go, uh,

18:07.530 --> 18:10.231
talk this over, privately?

18:15.071 --> 18:17.105
He insisted on paying
a hundred dollars

18:17.106 --> 18:19.307
- to recover this watch.
- We saw the Chinese lettering...

18:19.308 --> 18:22.010
- So it got us wondering...
- Was it even his in the first place?

18:22.011 --> 18:24.179
Because something seemed
a little off here.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.448
"Heart reduced to ashes.

18:26.449 --> 18:28.650
Remember water lily."

18:28.651 --> 18:31.052
But why would Sean Murphy
have Chinese characters

18:31.053 --> 18:33.288
- inside his watch?
- Got a British necklace.

18:33.289 --> 18:35.490
- Maybe he stole it.
- And an Italian hairdresser.

18:35.491 --> 18:37.892
Or it's a code. To a meeting place.

18:37.893 --> 18:39.894
Where would someone find water lilies?

18:39.895 --> 18:41.896
- The plot thickens.
- Wendy, could you see

18:41.897 --> 18:43.865
- if anyone had a watch stolen?
- Meanwhile tomorrow,

18:43.866 --> 18:45.412
we'll go back to the
pawnshop to find out the

18:45.413 --> 18:46.868
name of the guy that
unloaded the watch.

18:46.869 --> 18:48.736
And I'm going to check
into Sean Murphy.

18:48.738 --> 18:50.738
I am an officer of the law.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.707
- Do you...?
- No. That way.

18:55.177 --> 18:58.346
- You staged a distraction.
- And snuck in guns.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.896
What's Bessie gonna do when she finds

18:59.897 --> 19:01.483
out you're the one behind all of this?

19:01.484 --> 19:04.486
- If you tell her, I'm dead.
- And if we don't, so are we.

19:04.487 --> 19:06.488
You know how Bessie deals with moles

19:06.489 --> 19:08.490
in her organisation;
what were you thinking?

19:08.491 --> 19:10.425
I had no choice, alright?

19:10.426 --> 19:13.962
These guys are not the kind
you just say no to.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.964
Look, I found a note

19:15.965 --> 19:17.966
on my front door
with a knife stabbed through it.

19:17.967 --> 19:20.001
Said if I don't do exactly
as they say,

19:20.002 --> 19:22.003
the next time, the knife's
gonna be in my wife's chest.

19:22.004 --> 19:24.606
- So who are these guys?
- Honestly,

19:24.607 --> 19:26.975
I don't know. I just...
I know they mean business.

19:26.976 --> 19:28.910
How do they communicate with you?

19:28.911 --> 19:31.446
I get a note,
go to a drop to get the guns.

19:31.447 --> 19:33.509
I'm supposed to be there
right now. If I don't show up,

19:33.510 --> 19:36.056
- they're going to know I'm talking.
- You're going to go as planned

19:36.057 --> 19:38.323
- but I'm coming with you.
- And I'll keep sniffing on

19:38.324 --> 19:40.958
around here, but, Frankie,
watch your back.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.728
What could go wrong?

20:02.247 --> 20:04.348
Here to relieve you.

20:07.820 --> 20:10.955
Give me a minute. Hey Ronnie?

20:10.956 --> 20:13.458
- Yeah?
- Remember that guy sitting

20:13.459 --> 20:15.460
there at my table? The one that
said he was waiter at Muldoon's?

20:15.461 --> 20:18.396
- Yeah.
- What's his name, do you know him?

20:18.397 --> 20:21.632
Uh, Ward, I think. Marty Ward.
Yeah, that's it. Why?

20:21.633 --> 20:23.935
Well, Mr. Ward left my table
just before the robbery.

20:23.936 --> 20:24.823
So?

20:24.824 --> 20:27.538
So I think he was heading
toward the bathroom...

20:27.539 --> 20:31.442
If you think Marty's one of the
robbers, guess again. Ain't the type.

20:31.443 --> 20:34.846
- Get back to work, alright?
- Sure thing, boss.

20:38.384 --> 20:41.185
- So where's the drop?
- It's here.

20:43.455 --> 20:45.656
Mailbox on the wall beside the
door. That's where they leave

20:45.657 --> 20:48.793
- their instructions and the guns.
- Just try to act normal.

20:48.794 --> 20:52.096
I'll be here the whole time.
Go before they get suspicious.

21:01.673 --> 21:03.241
Frankie.

21:03.242 --> 21:05.343
Frankie! We gotta go.

21:07.780 --> 21:10.081
Get up! OK, I don't want
to have to carry you.

21:10.082 --> 21:12.450
- Wait, where am I?
- I'll explain later.

21:12.451 --> 21:14.452
And whatever you do,
if you look over there,

21:14.453 --> 21:16.621
don't go getting all emotional on me.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.191
You... you killed him?!

21:20.192 --> 21:22.093
What?! Why would I kill Vernon?

21:22.094 --> 21:24.095
Because he was the mole.

21:24.096 --> 21:25.763
What?!

21:25.764 --> 21:27.732
Well then, I guess he got
what he had coming to him,

21:27.733 --> 21:29.734
didn't he? But it wasn't from me.

21:29.735 --> 21:31.802
Police! Open up!

21:31.804 --> 21:35.072
- This does not look good.
- You are not opening that door.

21:35.074 --> 21:39.310
We had a report of gunshots.
Open up. Now!

21:39.311 --> 21:41.812
- Both of you, stay where you are!
- Constable, listen.

21:41.814 --> 21:42.971
You're both under arrest.

21:42.972 --> 21:45.349
This is a big mistake.
For a lot of reasons.

21:45.350 --> 21:47.818
Pretty obvious what happened here.

21:49.688 --> 21:52.123
Now, we're really in trouble!

21:52.124 --> 21:54.326
Now, we really gotta go!

22:12.347 --> 22:13.944
Gonna need a new bedroom window.

22:13.945 --> 22:15.912
- What happened?!
- I was cracked in the head,

22:15.914 --> 22:17.881
and I believe we're wanted for murder.

22:17.882 --> 22:19.950
- Who's dead?
- Vernon Asheton.

22:19.951 --> 22:21.952
Did you kill him? Did she kill him?

22:21.953 --> 22:23.553
- Did you kill him?
- No.

22:23.555 --> 22:26.023
- Why should I believe you?
- You're the one who woke up

22:26.024 --> 22:28.125
next to his dead body
with the gun by your hand.

22:28.126 --> 22:30.127
- You care to explain that?
- Well, I was framed.

22:30.128 --> 22:32.362
- Probably by you.
- Oh, you were framed,

22:32.363 --> 22:35.932
- but not by me.
- Then why should I believe you?

22:35.934 --> 22:38.468
Because someone out there
is trying to screw me over,

22:38.469 --> 22:41.304
and I need you and your friend
to help me find them. Got it?

22:41.306 --> 22:43.774
Got it. So what happened?

22:43.775 --> 22:45.709
Well, I followed you to the warehouse

22:45.710 --> 22:47.678
where I found Vernon dead
and you out cold.

22:47.679 --> 22:50.614
- Don't remind me.
- I could have left you there

22:50.615 --> 22:52.649
to swing for it, but
no good deed goes unpunished.

22:52.650 --> 22:55.852
I wouldn't call knocking out a
police constable a "good deed."

22:55.853 --> 22:57.854
- You're welcome.
- There's no time for jokes.

22:57.855 --> 22:59.421
The police are after you both, and

22:59.422 --> 23:01.291
this is the first place they'll look.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.560
We need to find a safe house.

23:06.130 --> 23:09.032
- You want to sleep here?!
- We just need a place

23:09.033 --> 23:11.034
to lay low until we can
figure things out.

23:11.035 --> 23:12.373
What kind of trouble
is Bessie Starkman

23:12.374 --> 23:13.503
going to bring to my restaurant?

23:13.504 --> 23:15.539
Nice to know
my reputation precedes me.

23:15.540 --> 23:17.574
I try to keep high-profile
criminals out of here.

23:17.575 --> 23:19.576
- Fewer bullets.
- I'm afraid we come as a pair

23:19.577 --> 23:21.611
tonight, Wendy,
but I will keep her in line.

23:21.613 --> 23:23.680
It's not Château Frontenac,
but it'll do.

23:23.681 --> 23:26.116
I've stayed in worse.

23:26.117 --> 23:28.885
Sorry! Closed for the night!

23:28.886 --> 23:30.687
It's Detective Greyson. Open up.

23:30.688 --> 23:32.923
In here. In here.

23:32.924 --> 23:35.092
Thanks, Wendy.
You never cease to amaze me.

23:35.093 --> 23:37.127
Places like this,
you gotta have places to hide.

23:37.128 --> 23:39.896
And no skeletons,
let's keep it that way.

23:39.897 --> 23:42.065
We both go in there,
we're gonna get real familiar.

23:42.066 --> 23:44.167
Keep quiet
and everything will be fine.

23:52.777 --> 23:54.878
The door to this
room ain't exactly invisible.

23:54.879 --> 23:56.847
Shh! It's fine.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.984
Good evening, Wendy.

24:00.985 --> 24:04.454
- You closed early tonight.
- We ran out of cold tea.

24:04.455 --> 24:06.990
That's a shame. Bet
everyone could use a drink tonight.

24:06.991 --> 24:09.726
- Rough night?
- Not particularly.

24:09.727 --> 24:12.162
- Spoken to Frankie?
- Nope. Came here

24:12.163 --> 24:14.132
for a late dinner and then
stayed to help Wendy clean up.

24:14.133 --> 24:15.165
So you don't know there's

24:15.166 --> 24:18.268
a warrant out for Frankie
on murder charges?

24:18.269 --> 24:20.270
That's absurd.

24:20.271 --> 24:23.974
So you're definitely
not hiding her, hm?

24:23.975 --> 24:27.144
Of course not. It's illegal to
harbour fugitives from the law.

24:27.145 --> 24:29.980
Yes, it is illegal.

24:29.981 --> 24:32.382
And I know you to be
an upstanding citizen

24:32.383 --> 24:34.718
who would never consider
to do anything illegal,

24:34.719 --> 24:38.054
like... selling alcohol, say.

24:38.056 --> 24:42.125
And you'd never do
anything illegal, like drink it.

24:42.126 --> 24:43.727
Touché.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.634
Oh.

24:50.635 --> 24:54.137
He is not taking me in.

24:54.138 --> 24:56.306
Put. That. Away.

24:56.307 --> 24:59.342
Look, ladies,

24:59.343 --> 25:02.345
We all know that Frankie is
mixed up with Bessie Starkman.

25:02.346 --> 25:04.648
There's a warrant out
for both of them.

25:04.649 --> 25:07.684
So when you see her...

25:07.685 --> 25:09.686
please tell her to turn herself in.

25:09.687 --> 25:12.222
Well, if I see her, I'll let her know.

25:12.223 --> 25:14.224
See, the thing about Frankie is
if she doesn't want

25:14.225 --> 25:18.094
- to be found, she won't be.
- I bet.

25:18.096 --> 25:21.665
Trudy...

25:21.666 --> 25:24.467
Frankie's in trouble. If she thinks

25:24.469 --> 25:27.304
she's gonna get the better
of Bessie Starkman, she's wrong.

25:29.340 --> 25:31.541
Think about that.

25:43.287 --> 25:44.773
If you don't put that gun away, I will

25:44.774 --> 25:46.156
hand you over to the police myself.

25:46.157 --> 25:48.158
Then I'll take you down with me.

25:48.159 --> 25:50.527
- You both need to calm down.
- I'm calm.

25:50.528 --> 25:53.296
- I'm very calm.
- Look,

25:53.297 --> 25:56.099
we all need to work together if
we're going to figure this out.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.702
So can you bury the hatchet
for now at least?

26:00.471 --> 26:03.440
OK, good. Because I'm gonna have
to lock the two of you in here.

26:03.441 --> 26:05.242
I've got the only key,
so you'll be safe.

26:05.243 --> 26:07.878
Thanks, Wendy.

26:07.879 --> 26:10.814
- So what's the plan?
- I might have

26:10.815 --> 26:13.817
a lead on one of the robbers.
His name is Marty Ward.

26:13.818 --> 26:16.119
He's a waiter
at this place - Muldoon's.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.388
You clocked the short guy pretty good.

26:18.389 --> 26:20.924
Right. So I'll be looking
for the guy with a shiner.

26:20.925 --> 26:22.959
Pleasant dreams, ladies.

26:42.513 --> 26:45.248
OK, I'll be... I'll be right there.

26:50.121 --> 26:51.821
Damnit!

26:54.992 --> 26:58.595
Great timing. I'm just about
to go meet Mary at the pawnshop.

26:58.596 --> 27:00.664
The pawnbroker's gonna tell us
who pawned the watch,

27:00.665 --> 27:03.166
and whoever they are,
they must be one of the robbers.

27:03.167 --> 27:05.936
Perfect! Because it turns out
Marty was not one of the robbers.

27:05.937 --> 27:09.105
Oh. Well, I found you another clue.

27:09.106 --> 27:12.375
Uh, I don't know why men
like to keep things

27:12.376 --> 27:14.377
in their socks, but they do.
This was in Vernon's.

27:14.378 --> 27:16.079
Oh.

27:17.949 --> 27:20.650
Oh. It's a phone number,
but it's not from around here.

27:20.651 --> 27:23.219
My thoughts exactly.
Also, a piece of advice:

27:23.221 --> 27:26.323
don't sniff the paper.
His feet were very perspire-y.

27:32.964 --> 27:35.799
All I've got is
some leftover chow mein

27:35.800 --> 27:38.168
and some strong tea.

27:38.169 --> 27:40.704
Thank you, Wendy, it's perfect.

27:40.705 --> 27:42.706
So, these guys who robbed your casino,

27:42.707 --> 27:44.708
they're not just a couple
of small-timers.

27:44.709 --> 27:47.677
They're heavy hitters, and
they're cleaning up loose ends.

27:47.678 --> 27:50.714
Just why they killed Vernon
and then set me up.

27:50.715 --> 27:53.850
They're making a play;
I'm just not sure what it is.

27:53.851 --> 27:56.386
Mmm! You know,
this ain't bad for breakfast.

27:56.387 --> 27:59.522
Morning. That smells good.

28:01.125 --> 28:02.892
Any luck at Muldoon's Grille?

28:02.894 --> 28:04.861
Found our waiter, but no shiner.

28:04.862 --> 28:08.365
But Flo found this
on Vernon Asheton's body.

28:08.366 --> 28:12.068
- It was in his sock.
- That's a Buffalo number.

28:12.069 --> 28:15.438
- How can you tell?
- I've called it before.

28:15.439 --> 28:17.707
It's a contact for
the Magaddino crime family.

28:17.708 --> 28:19.609
Why would Vernon have their number?

28:19.610 --> 28:21.544
Maybe he was part
of the gang all along.

28:21.545 --> 28:24.180
And if Vernon was calling
the Magaddinos...

28:24.181 --> 28:25.915
They could be behind the robberies.

28:25.917 --> 28:27.851
They were supposed
to stay out of Toronto.

28:27.852 --> 28:31.087
What aren't you telling us, Bessie?

28:33.658 --> 28:35.692
Not a lot scares me in this world,

28:35.693 --> 28:38.561
but the Magaddino family
are the exception to that rule.

28:43.935 --> 28:47.771
You are never gonna believe what
I found out about Sean Murphy.

28:47.772 --> 28:49.724
Oh, also, good morning. You
look very lovely today.

28:49.725 --> 28:50.707
Oh, OK, yeah. Thanks.

28:50.708 --> 28:53.009
Our client was arrested for assaulting

28:53.010 --> 28:55.478
a successful Chinese businessman
named Minsheng Zhang.

28:55.479 --> 28:57.981
- So he's been in jail?
- Zhang decided

28:57.982 --> 29:00.050
not to press charges, but
the incident is still on file.

29:00.051 --> 29:02.819
So maybe the pocket watch belonged
to this guy that he attacked.

29:02.820 --> 29:04.958
There is definitely
more to this story.

29:04.959 --> 29:09.893
Well, I found the name
that you extorted from me.

29:09.894 --> 29:12.162
But a fat lot of good it's going

29:12.163 --> 29:16.332
to do you because the man
probably gave a wrong name.

29:20.171 --> 29:21.938
Thank you.

29:21.939 --> 29:24.908
Oh, you're welcome.

29:24.909 --> 29:26.643
Come again.

29:26.644 --> 29:29.079
If the Magaddino family
is targeting you,

29:29.080 --> 29:32.182
- why did they set me up?
- You must know something.

29:32.183 --> 29:34.150
- Maybe Vernon let something slip.
- Something at the casino.

29:34.151 --> 29:36.519
I get it.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.423
Why you two are partners. Couple
of gals against the world.

29:40.424 --> 29:42.659
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

29:42.660 --> 29:44.961
Everyone watching my back is
on my payroll, and one of them

29:44.962 --> 29:47.931
- turned out to be a mole.
- Different management styles.

29:47.932 --> 29:49.933
Sure. We're more similar
than you think.

29:49.934 --> 29:51.935
Strong women getting ahead.

29:51.936 --> 29:54.771
- Our methods are opposite.
- Same coin, two sides.

29:54.772 --> 29:56.673
You're more of a dollar bill, Bessie.

30:01.679 --> 30:04.080
I asked around. No reports

30:04.081 --> 30:06.516
- of a stolen watch, but also...
- There's been a new wrinkle.

30:06.517 --> 30:08.818
It turns out Sean Murphy
assaulted a businessman named...

30:08.819 --> 30:11.087
- Minsheng Zhang.
- Right! Wait.

30:11.088 --> 30:13.590
- How did you know that?
- Minsheng Zhang has a daughter

30:13.591 --> 30:15.992
whose nickname is Water Lily.

30:15.993 --> 30:18.061
- We need to talk to her.
- She's back in China.

30:18.062 --> 30:20.463
Sent there by her father.

30:20.464 --> 30:24.234
"Heart reduced to ashes."
She must have given Sean

30:24.235 --> 30:27.003
the watch when she left.
They were in love!

30:27.004 --> 30:29.038
And that's why he was
so desperate to find it.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.474
And that would explain
why he attacked her father too.

30:31.475 --> 30:33.576
He probably found out
she was dating a white boy

30:33.577 --> 30:35.578
- and sent her back.
- And here we are,

30:35.579 --> 30:37.580
- thinking Sean's up to no good.
- Frankie,

30:37.581 --> 30:39.349
we need to talk to you.
And then we need to get

30:39.350 --> 30:41.184
- Sean his watch.
- Don't beat yourselves up.

30:41.185 --> 30:42.886
You found it for him.
Sean will be thrilled.

30:42.887 --> 30:44.954
What's going on, girls?

30:44.955 --> 30:47.390
- We found Sean's watch.
- That's good, isn't it?

30:47.391 --> 30:49.759
Except it revealed
we've become hard and cynical.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.295
If anyone knows hard
and cynical it's me,

30:52.296 --> 30:55.198
- and trust me, you ain't that.
- And who are you?

30:55.199 --> 30:58.334
Keeping you in business.
You're welcome.

30:58.335 --> 31:00.670
Well, at least we found out

31:00.671 --> 31:02.605
the identity of the guy who pawned it.

31:02.606 --> 31:04.774
Except the pawnbroker said
the name is probably fake.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.310
I need a ginger ale.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.114
- "Muldoon."
- Could be a coincidence.

31:11.115 --> 31:13.116
You know how I feel about that.

31:13.117 --> 31:14.903
There's no such thing.
You know, there was

31:14.904 --> 31:16.686
another man at the table
talking to Marty.

31:16.687 --> 31:18.688
He said he was the one
that named the restaurant.

31:18.689 --> 31:20.924
- Thought Muldoon's was "classy."
- How tall was he?

31:20.925 --> 31:23.426
Not very. And come to think of it,

31:23.427 --> 31:25.828
he really liked whiskey sours.

31:25.830 --> 31:27.764
Leo Albini. I served him,

31:27.765 --> 31:30.433
- but he never pays because...
- He's Ronnie's cousin.

31:30.434 --> 31:32.602
- He could be our guy.
- Does that mean

31:32.603 --> 31:34.637
- Ronnie was in on it?
- He was on the floor

31:34.638 --> 31:36.940
at the time, but he could be
involved somehow.

31:36.941 --> 31:38.942
Bessie, what do you...?

31:38.943 --> 31:40.910
Where did she go?!

31:40.911 --> 31:43.546
The casino. And she's out for blood.

31:48.597 --> 31:51.792
- Tell me! Who are you working for?
- I work for you.

31:51.793 --> 31:53.728
Just put the knife down, Bessie.

31:53.729 --> 31:56.230
You and your idiot cousin
know. Where's my money?!

31:56.231 --> 31:59.033
- He can't talk if he's dead.
- But I'd feel so much better.

31:59.034 --> 32:00.935
No! Please, I didn't take any money!

32:00.936 --> 32:02.970
But you helped Leo swindle me.

32:02.971 --> 32:05.039
The robbery? That was Leo?

32:05.040 --> 32:07.041
Yeah, and he's gonna have
the black eye to prove it.

32:07.042 --> 32:09.541
Now, you call him and
you get him over here!

32:10.846 --> 32:12.880
If he stole from you,
then he's got this coming.

32:12.881 --> 32:15.516
- Yeah.
- Can I have the phone?

32:15.517 --> 32:18.452
No, you might tip him off.
Frankie, you dial.

32:18.453 --> 32:21.989
Fine. But you're not killing anyone.

32:21.990 --> 32:25.159
Just dial.

32:25.160 --> 32:29.296
He's at work. KE-2342.

32:29.298 --> 32:32.133
- Operator, did you get that?
- [Yes. Connecting call now.]

32:36.705 --> 32:39.040
[Kanaskie Industries. Can I help you?]

32:40.876 --> 32:43.844
Put the knife away, Bessie.
Ronnie has nothing to do with this.

32:43.845 --> 32:46.447
Then who does?

32:46.448 --> 32:49.684
It's Charles Kanaskie, and he
knows that I can tie him to this.

32:49.685 --> 32:52.119
Charles Kanaskie?

32:56.959 --> 32:58.726
It's not too late to do that.

33:08.503 --> 33:11.772
Ah! Ah! Leave it.

33:11.773 --> 33:13.808
You call that a gun?

33:13.809 --> 33:16.711
I'm the only one carrying
a piece on this trip.

33:16.712 --> 33:19.780
And you wondered what
the difference was about us?

33:19.781 --> 33:22.316
I need Kanaskie to be alive
so he can clear my name

33:22.317 --> 33:24.351
- for Vernon's murder.
- Which, don't forget,

33:24.353 --> 33:26.320
you're on the hook for too.

33:26.321 --> 33:29.090
Fine, but leave the heat behind.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.561
Fine.

33:54.816 --> 33:56.951
We're closed, hit the road.

33:59.855 --> 34:02.723
Hello, Leo.
Where did you get the shiner?

34:07.195 --> 34:09.196
Leo, where are you going?

34:11.967 --> 34:14.335
- I'm on him!
- Charles Kanaskie!

34:14.335 --> 34:15.893
- Yeah.
- So this is

34:15.893 --> 34:18.061
what all my money has been paying for.

34:18.063 --> 34:20.731
Hey, opening a new casino isn't cheap.

34:20.732 --> 34:22.800
Even with the Magaddino family
helping you out?

34:22.801 --> 34:24.967
Yeah, they're my partners.

34:24.969 --> 34:26.904
I have to pay them my share.

34:26.905 --> 34:30.474
That'll be a shame when you
have to miss the grand opening.

34:30.475 --> 34:33.610
Bessie, just calm down!

34:33.610 --> 34:35.279
- Oh, I am perfectly calm.
- We had a deal.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.648
Explain to me again
what I get out that deal.

34:37.649 --> 34:40.884
Alright, look, please. I just
wanted to run my own joint.

34:40.885 --> 34:44.054
- I'll get you your money.
- I prefer vengeance.

34:44.054 --> 34:46.590
- It's better for my reputation.
- Drop it, Bessie!

34:46.591 --> 34:48.726
Leo's cuffed to the car, and
I picked this up along the way.

34:48.726 --> 34:51.762
You're as good at making
enemies as your partner.

34:51.763 --> 34:54.565
So. My gun on him.

34:54.565 --> 34:57.501
Your gun on me.

34:57.502 --> 34:59.436
What's the next move.

34:59.437 --> 35:01.405
I'll play you for him.

35:01.406 --> 35:04.341
- What?!
- Interesting.

35:04.342 --> 35:06.410
I-I-I'm not a stack
of poker chips here.

35:06.411 --> 35:08.946
Shut up!

35:08.947 --> 35:10.747
So how would this work?

35:10.749 --> 35:13.116
One hand.

35:13.118 --> 35:15.552
No tricks. No double crosses.
Winner gets him.

35:18.523 --> 35:20.624
You're on.

35:22.527 --> 35:25.362
Should we ask Trudy to deal?

35:25.363 --> 35:27.598
I remember your clumsy hands

35:27.599 --> 35:29.833
when Ronnie taught you both
how to play blackjack.

35:31.770 --> 35:33.937
You deal.

35:37.008 --> 35:40.477
- What's the game?
- Five card draw.

35:40.478 --> 35:42.479
One hand.

35:44.382 --> 35:47.150
- You're going to pick up?
- You first.

35:50.388 --> 35:53.690
- So what do you got?
- You think I'm gonna tell you?

35:53.691 --> 35:55.726
Don't have to. I can read you
like a book, Frankie Drake.

35:55.727 --> 35:58.495
You're gonna keep yapping
or are we gonna play cards?

36:09.741 --> 36:12.075
Gimme three.

36:13.745 --> 36:17.047
Not a very confident hand.

36:17.048 --> 36:21.051
Or maybe

36:21.052 --> 36:23.720
it's just the right call.

36:23.721 --> 36:25.722
All three of you broads are crazy.

36:25.723 --> 36:26.669
Shut up!

36:26.670 --> 36:29.393
Don't you worry, this'll
all be over soon.

36:29.394 --> 36:32.329
She's bluffing. I can tell.

36:34.732 --> 36:36.900
Dealer takes two.

36:44.742 --> 36:46.877
Fine, I'll go first.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.747
Full house.

36:50.748 --> 36:52.749
Queens over tens.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.520
- Seems appropriate.
- That's a hell of a hand.

36:56.521 --> 36:59.222
Yes, it is.

36:59.224 --> 37:01.692
- You did your best.
- I did.

37:05.897 --> 37:07.898
Aces over Jacks.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.368
Wait, she won?

37:11.369 --> 37:14.571
- Of course she did.
- She won! Ha!

37:14.572 --> 37:16.139
Deal's a deal.

37:16.140 --> 37:19.209
We good, Bessie?

37:19.210 --> 37:21.945
- Nice game.
- Good game.

37:23.615 --> 37:28.018
- You stay away from me.
- You stay away from me.

37:30.355 --> 37:33.223
Watch out for each other.

37:38.062 --> 37:41.665
Frankie, that was amazing!
You're really lucky!

37:41.666 --> 37:43.900
Luck had nothing to do with it.

37:46.004 --> 37:48.639
Pick it up.

37:48.640 --> 37:51.174
Another full house?!

37:51.175 --> 37:52.976
Dad had me dealing cards
when I was 4 years old.

37:52.977 --> 37:55.412
His first rule was
deal from the bottom.

37:55.413 --> 37:58.615
- You hustled her!
- And she had no idea.

37:58.616 --> 38:01.685
Hey, how about somebody
untying me over here?

38:01.686 --> 38:03.920
Hey, wanna play 52-card pickup?

38:14.842 --> 38:17.043
You don't know
how much this means to me.

38:17.044 --> 38:18.709
I think we might.

38:18.710 --> 38:21.378
Sean, can you tell us
about Water Lily?

38:21.379 --> 38:25.516
Well, uh, we studied
English literature together.

38:25.517 --> 38:28.285
She was a poet, same as me.

38:28.286 --> 38:30.724
And we used to read

38:30.725 --> 38:32.993
from the great masters
down by the lake.

38:32.994 --> 38:35.395
She would read in Chinese
from the Qing dynasty,

38:35.396 --> 38:37.597
and I would read her Joyce and Yeats.

38:37.598 --> 38:40.333
But her father wouldn't stand for it.

38:40.334 --> 38:42.335
I'm not Chinese,

38:42.336 --> 38:44.838
and I'll never be a businessman.

38:44.839 --> 38:47.307
She was on a ship a week
after he found out.

38:47.308 --> 38:49.776
That's rough. We're sorry.

38:49.777 --> 38:51.778
I loved her.

38:51.779 --> 38:53.780
And this watch, uh...

38:53.781 --> 38:56.650
Oh, I promised you another 50.

38:56.651 --> 38:58.718
Oh, no, no, no, no. Free of charge.

38:58.719 --> 39:01.054
No, you must be compensated, please.

39:01.055 --> 39:03.056
Just knowing you have the watch back,

39:03.057 --> 39:05.959
- that's enough for us.
- Thank you.

39:10.364 --> 39:12.899
So do you know where Lily is?

39:12.900 --> 39:15.435
Her village is somewhere
in Hunan Province.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.171
I have some contacts in China.

39:18.172 --> 39:20.540
If you want to get a message
to her, I might be able to help.

39:20.541 --> 39:23.843
Could you help me
get over there to see her?

39:25.746 --> 39:28.548
How about some love notes to start.

39:34.589 --> 39:37.123
Greyson, what are you doing
lurking outside my door?

39:37.124 --> 39:40.226
I wasn't lurking.
I was about to knock.

39:40.228 --> 39:42.228
Are you here to arrest me?

39:42.230 --> 39:44.230
Kanaskie sang like a canary.

39:44.232 --> 39:47.167
Backed up everything you said.
Looks like you're in the clear.

39:47.168 --> 39:50.437
Well, in that case, come on in.

39:58.346 --> 40:02.749
I was looking for you
all over, Frankie Drake.

40:02.750 --> 40:05.552
Wherever could you have been hiding?

40:05.553 --> 40:07.520
I wasn't hiding.

40:07.521 --> 40:10.623
I was at the library
catching up on some reading.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.393
That Fitzgerald sure can write.

40:13.394 --> 40:15.628
You must think I'm pretty stupid, huh?

40:15.630 --> 40:19.199
I was always taught,
never judge a book by its cover.

40:21.135 --> 40:22.936
Just be honest with me,

40:22.937 --> 40:24.971
for once.

40:24.972 --> 40:27.640
Are you working with Bessie Starkman?

40:27.642 --> 40:29.909
No.

40:29.911 --> 40:33.213
I explained everything when I
brought in Albini and Kanaskie.

40:33.214 --> 40:35.348
I read the statement;
doesn't mean I believe it.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.517
You think that I lied to the police?

40:37.518 --> 40:39.452
Wouldn't be the first time.

40:39.453 --> 40:43.189
What concerns me is that you're
tangled up with Bessie Starkman.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.225
That will not end well.

40:45.226 --> 40:47.660
I'm not tangled up
with Bessie Starkman.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.696
That's good.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.165
Because it is awfully hard to swim

40:52.166 --> 40:54.134
in a pair of concrete slippers.

40:54.135 --> 40:56.870
It sounds like
you're worried about me.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.505
Nah...

40:58.506 --> 41:00.473
It's just that if you turn up dead,

41:00.474 --> 41:01.992
it's my job to look
into it, and I don't

41:01.993 --> 41:03.476
want to deal with all that paperwork.

41:03.477 --> 41:06.546
Well, thank you for the concern.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.149
Anything for a friend.

41:09.150 --> 41:11.951
Is that what we are? We're friends?

41:14.121 --> 41:16.022
You know, if we were friends,

41:16.023 --> 41:18.491
you might consider pouring me
one of those drinks.

41:18.492 --> 41:21.828
I hear you make a mean gin martini.

41:21.829 --> 41:24.764
I thought you were more
of a whiskey man.

41:24.765 --> 41:28.201
I can make an exception.

41:28.202 --> 41:31.638
I could pour you a drink...

41:31.639 --> 41:34.541
but drinks lead to complications.

41:35.943 --> 41:37.510
It might.

41:39.847 --> 41:41.114
And I get it.

41:42.650 --> 41:45.785
Complications are complicated.

41:45.786 --> 41:49.022
So let's keep it uncomplicated.

41:59.166 --> 42:00.834
Mm.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.408
Don't wake up next to any more
dead bodies, Frankie Drake.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.456
- This is perfect, ladies!
- Mary is even drinking.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.425
- Oooh!
- Well...

42:25.426 --> 42:27.794
Well, you know,

42:27.795 --> 42:30.663
I've been pressing Frankie.
Greyson came by this afternoon,

42:30.664 --> 42:33.166
and they were all alone.

42:33.167 --> 42:36.970
- Was he wearing pants?
- Flo! Oh!

42:36.971 --> 42:40.707
There is nothing going
on there, believe me.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.709
- Hmm...
- Oh!

42:42.710 --> 42:44.744
- Who wants to play some cards?
- Oh, me!

42:44.745 --> 42:47.514
- Teach me to play poker.
- Deal me in!

42:47.515 --> 42:50.483
First, a toast. It's not every day

42:50.484 --> 42:52.452
that you're framed for murder
while working a case

42:52.453 --> 42:54.454
with your sworn enemy.

42:54.455 --> 42:56.856
You know, this seems to happen
more than we expected.

42:56.857 --> 42:59.259
But seriously, I don't know

42:59.260 --> 43:01.261
what I would have done
without you girls.

43:01.262 --> 43:04.397
We make a hell of a team,
so... cheers to us!

43:04.398 --> 43:08.034
Cheers to us!

43:08.035 --> 43:10.370
Hmm! Let's play some cards.

43:10.371 --> 43:12.639
- Uh-huh.
- I'm dealing.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.870
- Fine.
- OK.
