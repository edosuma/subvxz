Why, you little...

00:10.444 --> 00:13.212
(both groaning)

00:13.214 --> 00:17.216
Beneath this smile,
I'm in awful, awful pain!

00:17.218 --> 00:19.785
(screaming)

00:20.221 --> 00:22.221
Welcome, precious
primetime viewers,

00:22.223 --> 00:26.525
valued Internet downloaders,
and scary digital pirates!

00:26.527 --> 00:29.228
If you want to shield
your little darlings

00:29.230 --> 00:32.331
from our stomach-churning
holiday special,

00:32.333 --> 00:36.335
simply hit fast-forward
on your DVR remote...

00:37.371 --> 00:40.339
(distorted grunting)

00:49.116 --> 00:49.782
I went too far!

00:49.784 --> 00:51.617
Spoiled the whole
show for everybody!

00:51.619 --> 00:54.019
I don't deserve
to wield the remote.

00:54.021 --> 00:57.523
(shuddering):
Oh, I'm getting old and gray...

00:57.525 --> 00:59.625
I'm dead.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.760
(spooky music plays)

01:02.863 --> 01:06.198
Monster go watch The Office.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.403
Dunder-Mifflin just like
monster's workplace.

(grunting)

01:41.602 --> 01:42.434
(laser rifle fire)

01:42.436 --> 01:44.870
Milhouse, do we have enough
points for a weapons upgrade?

01:44.872 --> 01:48.340
Yeah! We really racked them up
eating all those elf babies.

01:48.342 --> 01:52.277
Ha-ha! Nothing beats
a weapon made of weapons.

01:53.514 --> 01:57.816
This is that video game Reverend
Lovejoy said you shouldn't play.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.885
Well, he's playing
it right now.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.753
Slay the wounded!

02:01.755 --> 02:03.722
I still think it's too violent.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.825
It's a game. We're
not hurting anybody.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.727
My non-lazy eye!

02:08.729 --> 02:09.661
Ooh.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.866
These classic board
games are fun and safe.

02:13.868 --> 02:15.501
(grunting)

02:15.503 --> 02:16.902
My other eye!

02:16.904 --> 02:18.237
(sighs)

02:18.239 --> 02:21.740
So which of these
"board lames" shall we play?

02:21.742 --> 02:22.741
Taffy Land?

02:22.743 --> 02:23.775
Drops and Risers?

02:23.777 --> 02:24.476

Ravenous, Ravenous Rhinos?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.246
Mouse Catch?
Battleboat?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.514
Funopoly?
Crate of Apes?

02:28.516 --> 02:29.748
Yahtzu?
Tiddlywonks?

02:29.750 --> 02:33.519
Hey, I've never seen
this one before.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.920
MILHOUSE:
Satan's Path?

02:34.922 --> 02:38.857
Hey, it's got to be good
if Satan put his name on it.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.060
Huh?

02:42.062 --> 02:44.096
Here. I'll be the demon,
you be the thimble.

02:44.098 --> 02:46.732
Oh, I'm always
the thimble.

02:49.904 --> 02:51.603
One...

02:51.605 --> 02:54.206
(rumbling, gasps)

02:54.208 --> 02:55.541
Two.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.342
BOTH:
Ooh!

03:01.782 --> 03:02.848
(train whistle blows)

03:02.850 --> 03:04.416
(shouting)

03:04.418 --> 03:06.652
There was a bank
error in my favor.

03:06.654 --> 03:11.223
And I'm spending it all on
Oriental Avenue prostitutes!

03:13.260 --> 03:14.693
(gasps)

03:14.695 --> 03:18.463
MILHOUSE:
All the games came to life!

03:23.204 --> 03:25.537
(chattering)

03:26.674 --> 03:28.840
I don't like the looks
of that knight, Chief.

03:28.842 --> 03:29.942
Don't worry.
We're safe.

03:29.944 --> 03:33.378
He's two steps away,
and one to the right.

03:36.317 --> 03:36.848
(groans)

03:36.850 --> 03:40.385
For me, it's game,
set... and match.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.421
I think you mean
"check, and mate."

03:42.423 --> 03:44.656
Just got crushed by
a giant horse, Lou.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.892
You want to cut me a break?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.527
(romantic music plays)

03:48.529 --> 03:51.897
Time to meet my mystery dude.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.832
(chuckling)

03:53.834 --> 03:55.267
(sighs)

03:58.005 --> 03:59.605
Ah.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.706
(Homer grunting)

04:00.708 --> 04:03.642
Oh, man, I'm never coming down!

04:03.644 --> 04:04.376
Ah!

04:04.378 --> 04:06.411
Whoo-hoo! Another ladder!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.546
Riding high!

04:07.548 --> 04:08.814
Sinking low!

04:08.816 --> 04:10.349
Top of the heap!

04:10.351 --> 04:11.917
Oh! Down I go!

04:11.919 --> 04:13.619
On top for good!

04:13.621 --> 04:15.921
Oh, cruel hubris!

04:19.393 --> 04:20.892
How do we make this stop?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.361
Well, my Latin's
a little rusty,

04:22.363 --> 04:24.730
but I think to get everything
back in its box,

04:24.732 --> 04:26.498
you have to finish the game.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.300
And if we don't finish?

04:28.302 --> 04:32.704
You're going to have to deal
with more nonsense like that.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.007
ALL:
Yatszu.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.576
Here we go,
back in the cup.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.745
At least the cup
is lined with felt.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.681
Hey, Mr. Positive,
shut the hell up.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.651
(roars)

04:45.653 --> 04:47.085
(monkey chattering)

04:47.087 --> 04:49.488

04:49.490 --> 04:51.089
(chattering)

04:51.091 --> 04:52.991
(rumbling crash)

04:54.461 --> 04:56.728
We'll be safe on
this Battleboat.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.997
Set a course for B-7.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.333
(motor humming)

05:02.303 --> 05:04.469
POWERFUL VOICE:
B-7.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.637
MILHOUSE:
They dunked our Battleboat!

05:05.639 --> 05:07.806
I wish I could see
my mom one last time,

05:07.808 --> 05:10.509
so I can say, "This
is all your fault!"

05:10.511 --> 05:14.313
Colonel Ketchup, I say
it was you that killed him

05:14.315 --> 05:16.581
in the parlor,
with the letter-opener!

05:16.583 --> 05:21.720
He was going to leave me, and
I'm too old to find anyone else.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.654
(grumbles)

05:22.656 --> 05:24.389
Come on, man, climb up!

05:24.391 --> 05:26.358
No. I might sink the letter.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.427
And "Q" is just too valuable.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.095
That blank could be
any letter we want.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.398
Maybe I'm just tired of living.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.534
(bubbles gurgling)

05:39.640 --> 05:41.340
The final challenge: Mousecatch.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.643
A game so lame,
no one's ever finished it.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.680
(wild cackling and roaring)

05:49.583 --> 05:50.682
Crazy Eights!

05:50.684 --> 05:51.516
Think, Bart. Think!

05:51.518 --> 05:54.553
What was that lesson I
learned from video games?

05:54.555 --> 05:57.022
Oh, yeah! Kill, kill, kill!

05:57.024 --> 05:58.657
(crying)

05:58.926 --> 06:02.661
There comes a time to beat
the crap out of childish things.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.962
(wild raving)

06:03.964 --> 06:05.597
(groaning)

06:06.834 --> 06:08.066
(gasps)

06:19.480 --> 06:22.581
Sure is a hard way
to catch a mouse.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.688
Oh, this stupid
thing never works.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.090
(grunts)

06:43.437 --> 06:46.571
That's it. From now on,
we'll just play Hangman.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.172
Wait, wait.

06:47.174 --> 06:49.141
We still got one more letter.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.609
Is it... 3?

06:50.611 --> 06:53.445
(buzzer sounds)
That's not a letter.

06:53.447 --> 06:56.815
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.394
(ominous music plays)

07:11.331 --> 07:12.597
(gasps)

07:12.599 --> 07:14.833
(screams)

07:15.569 --> 07:18.770
Man, it's been a crazy morning.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.739
Champagne?

07:21.809 --> 07:24.042
Oh, Homie, what
a great idea--

07:24.044 --> 07:26.578
to take a cruise
in uncharted waters.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.648
Yeah, charts are
for squares, baby.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.819
(grunting)

07:33.821 --> 07:36.955
Whew. Sure is hot out here.

07:36.957 --> 07:37.823
Mmm.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.691
Mmm.
(slide whistle tone)

07:39.693 --> 07:42.160
Oh, that's my cell phone.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.130
What is it?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.199
Lenny, I'm on a
second honeymoon!

07:47.201 --> 07:50.068
You'll have to pick
your own Lotto numbers.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.003
Now, where were we?

07:52.005 --> 07:55.674
(both giggling)

07:55.676 --> 07:57.809
Oh, baby, let's give
those seagulls

07:57.811 --> 07:59.678
something to squawk about.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.246
(giggles)

08:01.248 --> 08:01.580
Huh?

08:01.582 --> 08:05.484
Oh yeah, baby, I like
it when you're distracted.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.284
Huh?

08:06.286 --> 08:07.819
(oars splashing)

08:10.057 --> 08:11.122
Homie, help him up.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.826
(sighs)
Fine. I'll get the hook.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.262
HOMER:
Don't fight it.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.065
(man mumbling)
Don't... That's it.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.167
A little more.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.236
How's that?

08:24.238 --> 08:25.203
(panting)

08:25.205 --> 08:26.938
You're safe now, my friend.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.575
This poor man must have
been out there for days.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.912
He's nothing but
hard, bronze muscle.

08:35.249 --> 08:36.848
Bless you.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.019
Okay, this guy's
taken care of.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.687
So... uh, you know...

08:42.689 --> 08:44.956
I'm not really in
the mood anymore.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.093
Fine. I'm going for a walk.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.898
(grumbles)

08:56.036 --> 08:58.203
(grumbles)

09:00.741 --> 09:02.240
(huffs)

09:06.680 --> 09:07.112
My name's Roger.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.215
I was the chef on the
Albatross, working
for a businessman

09:10.217 --> 09:12.183
taking his partners to Tahiti.

09:12.185 --> 09:15.654
One night, he asked
for pie for dessert...

09:15.656 --> 09:18.790
<i>As the pie cooled innocently</i>
<i>on a porthole sill,</i>

09:18.792 --> 09:22.861
<i>my employer attempted</i>
<i>to inject it with poison.</i>

09:22.863 --> 09:24.496
<i>But I caught him in the act.</i>

09:24.498 --> 09:27.432
<i>Unfortunately, he had the</i>
<i>strength of ten businessmen.</i>

09:27.434 --> 09:31.069
<i>He sent me napward with a</i>
<i>bottle of low-sodium soy sauce.</i>

09:31.071 --> 09:35.707
Poor man. You've been
through so much.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.576
Hey. I've had a hard trip, too.

09:37.578 --> 09:41.079
One of the lenses fell
out of my sunglasses!

09:41.081 --> 09:43.648
Ah... oh, yeah...

09:43.650 --> 09:47.819
Oh, Roger, you really
know what you're doing.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.853
(gasps)

09:48.855 --> 09:50.956
(radio static)

09:50.958 --> 09:52.824
No luck.

09:52.993 --> 09:58.263
Anyway, when I came to,
everyone on board was dead.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.900
<i>I fled the horrific scene.</i>

10:01.902 --> 10:03.168
(squawks)

10:03.670 --> 10:05.070
<i>And after days at sea,</i>

10:05.072 --> 10:07.072
<i>I found my savior.</i>

10:07.074 --> 10:07.806
<i>You, Marge.</i>

10:07.808 --> 10:11.776
And, in a very insignificant
way, you, Homer.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.978
God, it was horrible.

10:12.980 --> 10:17.449
Marge? Can I have a word
with you in private?

10:17.451 --> 10:18.984
I don't trust that guy.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.886
I bet he killed everyone
on that boat himself.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.455
That's crazy talk.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.624
ROGER:
Excuse me.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.792
You've both been so kind to me,

10:27.794 --> 10:31.696
I baked you this pie.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.132
That is so sweet.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.703
Why do piemakers
get all the girls?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.205
Why did you do that?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.806
It was poisoned!
No it wasn't!

10:41.808 --> 10:43.141
Well, it was rhubarb.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.009
No, it was berry-peach.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.710
HOMER: Berry-peach?
That's my favorite!

10:45.712 --> 10:50.281
Please, Homer. I am so sick of
this unmotivated jealous--

10:50.283 --> 10:52.617
(screams)

10:53.086 --> 10:56.955
The pie was poisoned.
You were right.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.091
I guess we've got to kill
him before he kills us.

11:00.093 --> 11:04.896
Well, we'd better do it quick,
because he's making scones!

11:07.901 --> 11:11.302
They should call this one
"Recipe For Murder."

11:11.304 --> 11:13.004
What do you mean,
"this one"?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.239
Never mind.

11:19.012 --> 11:23.715
Oh, Roger, would you
hand me the suntan oil?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.354
(grunting suggestively)

11:29.356 --> 11:31.956
(spring popping zanily)

11:31.958 --> 11:33.958
Ooh, got a text.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.093
Now!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.094
(grunts)

11:38.965 --> 11:40.098
Dear God.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.633
We just killed a man.

11:41.635 --> 11:45.837
Yeah, the decent thing
to do is bury him at sea.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.112
Come and get it, barnacles.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.688
Huh?

12:03.690 --> 12:04.889
(gasps)

12:14.201 --> 12:15.834
(both gasp)

12:15.836 --> 12:17.836

the truth.

killed that shark!
