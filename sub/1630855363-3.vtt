00:02.636 --> 00:04.771
(Carmy inhales deeply)

00:06.940 --> 00:08.575
CARMY:
I Googled "fun"
the other day.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.746
"...what provides
amusement or enjoyment."

00:12.779 --> 00:14.180
That's what it means.

00:17.050 --> 00:20.420
I am, uh, currently
opening a restaurant

00:20.454 --> 00:23.490
that's providing
zero amusement or enjoyment.

00:23.523 --> 00:24.491
Um...

00:26.226 --> 00:27.727
No, no, I'm kidding, it's, um...

00:29.730 --> 00:31.665
it's okay. I'm, uh...

00:34.434 --> 00:36.736
I don't know,
I-I-I'm trying to

00:37.304 --> 00:40.674
start from a-a healthy place.

00:40.707 --> 00:44.177
A-a-a positive place.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.012
And, um...

00:48.348 --> 00:50.517
yeah, that's the goal, right?

00:56.323 --> 00:58.459
I think when I was a kid, um,

00:59.460 --> 01:02.463
anything that would give me
any sort of excitement

01:02.496 --> 01:05.466
or-or-or amusement
or enjoyment, uh,

01:05.966 --> 01:07.534
it always got kinda fucked.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.707
You know, I-I don't think
my family meant to ruin it

01:13.740 --> 01:14.975
or anything like that,
you know.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.577
I-I don't think
they did it on purpose.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.811
But I-I think...

01:18.545 --> 01:21.181
sometimes they just,
they try too hard.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.753
You know,
or they'd make promises

01:26.820 --> 01:28.321
that they weren't able to keep.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.195
(inhales deeply)

01:37.531 --> 01:39.466
Have to remind myself
to breathe sometimes.

01:39.499 --> 01:40.734
I, um,

01:40.801 --> 01:42.736
have to remind myself to, uh...

01:43.704 --> 01:45.338
to be present, you know.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.743
Remind myself
that the sky is not falling,

01:49.777 --> 01:51.712
that, um,
there is no other shoe,

01:52.246 --> 01:53.847
which is incredibly difficult

01:53.881 --> 01:56.549
because there is always
another shoe.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.451
(light laughter)

02:04.725 --> 02:06.026
I don't know.
I think, um...

02:09.763 --> 02:11.298
You know,
maybe if I could provide

02:11.364 --> 02:14.702
more-more-more amusement
or-or enjoyment for myself,

02:14.735 --> 02:17.637
it would be easier to, uh,
to provide for others, you know.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.074
I don't know. Um...

02:24.945 --> 02:27.547
Yeah. Anyway,
I'm happy to be here.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.382
Thank you, guys.
Thanks for letting me share.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.125

02:46.067 --> 02:48.368
(clacking continues)

02:51.738 --> 02:53.574
NEWSCASTER 1:
Bridgeport, known to be
the neighborhood diner

02:53.607 --> 02:56.109
people counted on for
the past seven decades

02:56.109 --> 02:58.011
is closing its doors for good.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.646
NEWSCASTER 2:
Yesterday, the restaurant
made the announcement

02:59.679 --> 03:01.448
that it would be
closing permanently.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.816
WOMAN:
Everybody loves the food.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.884
They love the service.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.619
They love this restaurant.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.253
NEWSCASTER 3:
...that people
could always count on...

03:07.320 --> 03:08.455
NEWSCASTER 4:
...for the many
employees that have

03:08.455 --> 03:09.990
worked at the restaurant
for decades,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.491
the news came
as a devastating...

03:18.299 --> 03:20.500
(sizzling)

03:28.175 --> 03:29.910
You know what a lot
of restaurants suck at?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.778
CARMY: Hmm. How much time do
I have to answer that question?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.246
Hmm. Desserts.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.783
Do we have any miles?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.251
Uh, yes, Pete at United.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.186
-Could we use 'em?
-Of course.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.888
SYDNEY:
Can I pitch you
something crazy?

03:40.954 --> 03:41.922
We send
Marcus somewhere?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.090
So maybe not so crazy.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.859
No, no, I think
that's, uh, smart.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.162
-Yeah?
-Yeah. But, um, how's his mom?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.163
SYDNEY:
I think she's stable,
I don't know.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.965
But I just was thinking
it might be good

03:51.998 --> 03:53.501
to send him somewhere wild.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.601
Wild, like?

03:54.635 --> 03:55.902
Like Copenhagen?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.838
Yeah.
Yeah, I got spots there.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.206
I mean, I figured you would.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.042
CARMY: You happy?

04:02.076 --> 04:05.011
Yeah, I marinated the radicchio,
burned grapefruit,

04:05.011 --> 04:06.546
got a little bit
of chili in there.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.517
-CARMY: Alright.
-SYDNEY: Alright.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.091
-CARMY: Mm.
-(dropping utensils)

04:17.124 --> 04:18.025
-Fucking shit.
-SYDNEY: Mm-mm-mm. Mm-mm.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.259
-The salt.
-Mm-mm.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.028
-It's too much salt.
-Fuck me.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.197
-CARMY: You got water?
-Uh, yeah.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.131
(Carmy clears throat)

04:24.131 --> 04:25.032
You marinated it too long.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.900
-It's okay, though.
-I mean, it's not okay

04:26.934 --> 04:28.134
-if it's two times in a row.
-(clears throat)

04:28.969 --> 04:30.070
God.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.672
That's why
we're doing this, alright?

04:33.306 --> 04:35.242
(sighs) I wanna
make a suggestion.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.110
I think our palates are fucked.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.946
Where is the suggestion?

04:40.013 --> 04:40.981
CARMY: I think
that we need to go out.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.415
We need to try some stuff.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.851
Like a reset.

04:43.884 --> 04:44.985
-You're sending me home?
-CARMY: No.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.187
No, I'm not sending you home.

04:46.220 --> 04:49.690
I'm sending us out for...
inspiration.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.591
It's gonna take me about
an hour to clean this up,

04:51.658 --> 04:53.627
and then I'll, uh,
meet you at Kasama.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.962
Sound good?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.597
-Yeah, sounds good.
-CARMY: Okay.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.631
Thank you.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.032
And, uh, Syd?

04:59.032 --> 05:00.267
SYDNEY: Yeah?

05:00.301 --> 05:02.236
It was really,
it was almost perfect.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.203
Almost.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.272
Yeah.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.810
-See you in an hour.
-SYDNEY: Mm-hmm.

-EVA: Good.
-Yeah?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.432
They said that
she got stuck on a Zoom.

06:38.465 --> 06:39.766
Do you know
what that's about?

06:40.167 --> 06:41.802
Got a promotion.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.937
Uncle Frank is proud of her.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.339
So am I.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.475
So we had a little party.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.475
Huh.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.444
-Frank, huh?
-And Mom got a raise, too.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.681
Which is why Uncle Frank
got the good cake from Weber's.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.784
That's awesome.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.188
That mom got a promotion.
She's a hard worker.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.089
And that's important, right?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.893
Yeah, but you still have
to pay child support

07:05.926 --> 07:07.194
'cause fair is fair.

07:10.497 --> 07:13.266
(exhales)
I love taking care of you.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.068
And I always will.

I know, Daddy.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.379
Give me a hug.

Alright, backpack attack.
Here we go.

I love Taylor Swift, too.

-Hello.
-WOMAN (over phone):
Did you
really give me a fake number?

08:07.955 --> 08:09.189
Claire?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.190
Should my feelings be hurt?

08:10.190 --> 08:11.525
I think they're hurt.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.526
CARMY: Mm.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.195
No. No, no, no. Sorry, no.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.663
That must have, uh,
that must have been a mistake.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.499
You know I know your entire
family and all the Faks, right?

08:20.701 --> 08:21.502
CARMY:
You know all the Faks?

08:21.535 --> 08:22.869
Yeah, I know
all the fuckin' Faks.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.037
And they're gonna
come beat you up.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.005
(laughs)

08:25.038 --> 08:28.475
There are, um, there are
a lot of Faks. Yeah.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.913
Why, just walk me through
giving me a fake number. Why?

08:33.681 --> 08:37.350
CARMY:
Hmm... No, no.
'Cause I, um...

08:37.350 --> 08:39.653
I didn't mean, I didn't mean
for that to happen.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.154
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.225
I'm sorry.
It was a mistake, okay?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.262
Thank you.
I-I really appreciate that.

08:48.329 --> 08:50.264
Well, I was originally
calling before I found out

08:50.297 --> 08:52.199
I got fake numbered
and had to ask Neil

08:52.199 --> 08:53.901
for your real number
to ask if you were busy today.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.335
So now I have two questions.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.604
CARMY:
Shoot. Yeah.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.640
Okay. One, is it okay
that I have your number,

08:59.673 --> 09:02.142
or did you really not want me
to have your number?

09:03.110 --> 09:04.578
No, no, no, no.
It's-it's, uh...

09:04.578 --> 09:06.713
I want you, I want you
to have my number.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.281
Okay, say that one more time.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.251
I want you to have my number.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.288
Okay, cool.
Are you busy today?

09:16.489 --> 09:17.324
(clicks tongue)

09:18.592 --> 09:19.659
Um...

09:24.531 --> 09:25.733
So, I'm, I, um--

09:25.766 --> 09:28.269
Okay, can you just,
can you just
not make this weird?

09:28.269 --> 09:30.737
Like, I just need a favor.
My cousin bailed on me.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.706
What, Big Denny?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.374
CLAIRE: No, Mac.
Denny's dead.

09:35.276 --> 09:36.309
Oh.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.778
Damn, Denny.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.646
CLAIRE:
Yeah, totally sucks,

09:38.679 --> 09:39.847
but I have to
move all this shit

09:39.880 --> 09:41.548
from my mom who is not dead.

09:41.615 --> 09:45.419
She's actually
absolutely thriving,
into storage and I-I...

09:45.452 --> 09:47.621
There are really big boxes,
and I need a really big car.

09:47.621 --> 09:48.889
Do you still have that van?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.624
Yes. No, we do.
We still have that van.

09:50.658 --> 09:53.260
Um, I am... in.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.296
Really?

09:58.599 --> 09:59.666
Yeah. Yeah, really.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.804
Okay, I'll text you the address.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.772
No, no, I know where it is.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.275
CLAIRE: Are you sure?
'Cause I'm worried
about your number issue.

10:09.510 --> 10:10.444
I know where it is.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.613
You know what?
I'll give my address to Fak.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.682
-(Carmy laughs)
-And then he can give it to you.

10:15.715 --> 10:16.716
Does that sound good?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.185
And then punch you in the face.
Does that sound good?

10:19.252 --> 10:21.622
(laughs)
No, no, I don't need Fak.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.191
CLAIRE: You know,
he, um, he told me

10:24.258 --> 10:25.325
that you guys are really close

10:25.392 --> 10:26.626
and that he's
your best friend.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.762
Fak said that?

10:28.762 --> 10:29.930
CLAIRE: Mm-hmm.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.464

21:53.246 --> 21:54.515
Well, you got wood rot.

21:54.548 --> 21:56.750
You got termites,
you got roaches,

21:56.783 --> 21:58.051
you got dead raccoons.

21:58.085 --> 21:59.386
Plural, raccoons?

21:59.386 --> 22:00.554
FAK:
And, uh, rotten wood.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.756
So obviously the wall
is fucking gone.

22:02.790 --> 22:03.924
This isn't a facelift anymore.

22:03.958 --> 22:05.926
Yeah. You know what, pal?
I think you might be right.

22:05.959 --> 22:07.261
Yeah, it was terrible.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.596
-Like... terrible.
-Um...

22:09.629 --> 22:10.998
Um, what... What's...

22:11.064 --> 22:12.365
Um... Sorry.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.868
So we just knocked
everything down?

22:14.868 --> 22:16.036
CARMY: Yeah, yeah.

22:17.805 --> 22:18.872
What?

22:19.707 --> 22:21.708
Sorry. You would have
preferred that we...

22:21.742 --> 22:22.877
Call me?

22:23.778 --> 22:27.547
That I call you to tell you
the-the-the walls are rotting

22:27.547 --> 22:29.583
-and they need
to be knocked down?
-Yeah, exactly.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.451
Um...

22:34.922 --> 22:36.656
Okay, sorry, so just, um...

22:37.457 --> 22:39.693
You know, for-for next time,
what should I have done?

22:39.693 --> 22:40.861
(laughs)

22:40.861 --> 22:43.330
Um, th-this just feels like, uh,

22:43.397 --> 22:44.565
-obviously a really
big decision.
-Sure.

22:44.565 --> 22:46.533
And it would have been nice
to have been included in it?

22:46.566 --> 22:47.668
Okay. Got it. No, no.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.536
Next time the, uh, the walls
need to be knocked down,

22:49.570 --> 22:50.770
there's nothing
we can do about it...

22:51.938 --> 22:53.306
You let me know.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.109
Okay.

22:57.611 --> 22:58.612
I'll let you know.

23:01.248 --> 23:02.416
-I'll let you know.
-Yeah.

23:02.416 --> 23:04.551
-Thanks, Chef.
-Yeah, thank you, Chef.

23:04.618 --> 23:06.487
Ooh!

23:06.520 --> 23:08.321
(laughter)

23:15.863 --> 23:18.498
Hey. Uh, yeah.
Good. Thanks.

23:18.531 --> 23:22.502
Um, I was wondering if I could
cash in on that favor.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.571
Um, yeah.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.706
Do-do you still have
a kitchen I could borrow?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.450
-You all good? Awesome.
-Yeah.

23:36.450 --> 23:37.651
-Thank you so much for...
-Yeah, for sure. No.

23:37.685 --> 23:39.753
-We're hiring
if this doesn't work out.
-Stop!

23:45.959 --> 23:46.593
Fuck me.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.695
(winces)

24:26.867 --> 24:28.101
