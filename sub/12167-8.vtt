WEBVTT

00:03.124 --> 00:08.254
They are called the Genii. They are simple
people, but good farmers and fair traders.

00:08.421 --> 00:12.759
We're still months away from producing
successful crops on the mainland,

00:12.926 --> 00:15.011
and heading for a food shortage.

00:15.178 --> 00:17.931
It's getting desperate.
We're almost out of coffee.

00:18.097 --> 00:21.226
Maybe you should stop drinking
eleven cups a day.

00:21.392 --> 00:24.312
I'm getting my fair share
before it's all gone.

00:24.479 --> 00:27.106
- Sounds fair.
- Hm.

00:28.566 --> 00:32.570
I'm all for trade. But shouldn't we
find a way to help defend ourselves?

00:32.737 --> 00:37.492
- How can a bunch of farmers do that?
- Introduce us to people who can help.

00:37.659 --> 00:40.119
For now let's take care of the basics.

00:40.286 --> 00:42.830
It's good to get to know
your neighbours.

00:42.997 --> 00:45.416
The Genii Stargate is near their village.

00:45.583 --> 00:49.003
I suggest we walk.
The Puddle Jumper may alarm them.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.589
As I said, they are very simple.

00:51.756 --> 00:54.133
Sounds like a mission.

01:08.856 --> 01:12.193
<i>(Sheppard) All right. Where to, Teyla?</i>

01:12.360 --> 01:14.445
We should allow them to come to us.

01:14.612 --> 01:18.366
- If you know where their village is...
- They trust me.

01:18.533 --> 01:20.952
- But that trust was hard-earned.
- OK.

01:21.119 --> 01:24.581
- What is it you said they grow here?
- Many things.

01:24.747 --> 01:27.458
They're best known for a bean
known as tava.

01:27.625 --> 01:30.044
- What, java?
- Tava.

01:31.546 --> 01:33.631
How will they know we're here?

01:33.798 --> 01:36.551
They already do.

01:38.136 --> 01:42.932
- They look friendly enough.
- The eldest is called Tyrus. We've traded.

01:47.395 --> 01:50.607
- Teyla Emmagan.
- Tyrus.

01:50.773 --> 01:53.109
- It has been many days.
- Too many.

01:53.276 --> 01:55.069
Teyla.

01:55.236 --> 02:00.491
This is Major Sheppard,
Dr McKay and Lieutenant Ford.

02:00.658 --> 02:04.787
- My daughter Sora.
- You must be very proud.

02:06.581 --> 02:11.544
- She's betrothed.
- I wasn't hitting on your daughter. I just...

02:11.711 --> 02:14.756
They have come to trade
for a share of your crops.

02:14.923 --> 02:18.760
- Yet you bring weapons.
- Only to defend ourselves.

02:20.303 --> 02:23.806
- Do you dress of your own accord?
- Of course. Why?

02:23.973 --> 02:26.601
He wants to know
if you work with us or for us.

02:26.768 --> 02:30.605
Ah. These are my friends, Tyrus.

02:30.772 --> 02:34.776
I would not have brought them
if I did not think them worthy to be yours.

02:36.569 --> 02:38.821
We'll take you to see Cowen.

02:38.988 --> 02:41.074
Follow me.

02:49.541 --> 02:52.210
Maybe we should offer
a sense of humour in trade.

02:52.377 --> 02:54.462
Sure. They can have yours.

02:54.629 --> 02:58.216
<i>(laughs) Oh, please, my side. You slay me.</i>

02:58.383 --> 03:00.260
<i>(Sheppard) I'm thinking about it.</i>

03:00.426 --> 03:03.805
I'm bringing them in.
All operations to silent mode.

04:16.293 --> 04:21.257
- These medicines are potent?
- They can stop bacterial infections.

04:21.423 --> 04:24.427
It would help us
through a harsh winter.

04:24.594 --> 04:29.182
- Hm. We will need more than you offer.
- More?

04:29.349 --> 04:31.935
You don't understand
how cool this medicine is.

04:32.101 --> 04:36.439
- Leave if you wish.
- Leave?

04:36.606 --> 04:39.275
I thought you said
they were fair traders.

04:40.693 --> 04:44.906
We have always been able
to achieve a reasonable bargain.

04:45.073 --> 04:48.326
You ask for much of our harvest.

04:48.493 --> 04:52.372
Sufficient new crops must be planted
to replenish our stores,

04:52.539 --> 04:54.832
or it is the Genii who will starve.

04:54.999 --> 04:59.712
That will require new land to be cleared.
Clearing land is slow, hard work.

04:59.879 --> 05:03.716
It will lose us growing time
between now and the next harvest.

05:03.883 --> 05:07.512
OK. What if clearing land
was fast and easy?

05:07.679 --> 05:10.390
<i>(laughs)</i>

05:10.557 --> 05:14.727
You know a simple way of uprooting
the stump of a 300-year-old tree?

05:14.894 --> 05:18.690
As a matter of fact, I do.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.615
<i>(man) Come on over.
They're about to start.</i>

05:27.782 --> 05:30.827
Cover your ears!

05:30.994 --> 05:33.246
- I don't understand.
- It can be loud.

05:33.413 --> 05:36.124
Come on. You're gonna wish you did.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.459
Lieutenant.

05:39.919 --> 05:42.422
Fire in the hole.

05:53.474 --> 05:55.560
It's called C4.

05:58.938 --> 06:02.442
If you can supply us
with a sufficient quantity of C4,

06:02.609 --> 06:04.611
we will trade the crop you require.

06:04.777 --> 06:08.781
- This instead of the medicine?
- As well as the medicine.

06:08.948 --> 06:13.328
Really? That wasn't impressive enough?

06:13.494 --> 06:15.580
It is you who are in need.

06:19.667 --> 06:22.837
Well, I'll have to discuss this
with my people.

06:23.004 --> 06:25.715
I'm sure we can come to terms.

06:25.882 --> 06:28.843
Teyla, thank you for bringing
new trading partners.

06:29.010 --> 06:31.554
Please stay as our guests.

06:31.721 --> 06:34.766
There will be a harvest ceremony later.

06:37.352 --> 06:39.729
Wonderful.

06:39.896 --> 06:41.898
- Ford?
- Sir?

06:42.065 --> 06:45.026
We're talking harvest ceremony.

06:46.402 --> 06:48.279
Sounds like fun, sir.

06:48.446 --> 06:50.698
I'll be back soon.

06:51.783 --> 06:54.452
I should go back with the major.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.554
Explosives?
This is a scientific expedition, Major.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.765
- I know.
- But you want us to become arms dealers.

07:15.932 --> 07:20.103
- Ever tried to clear a stump by hand?
- Yes. It's a hobby.

07:20.270 --> 07:24.190
They are taking a chance by giving us
so much of their crop this year.

07:24.357 --> 07:27.777
Plus the medicines I already agreed to?

07:31.072 --> 07:33.992
I think in the future
I should do the negotiating.

07:34.158 --> 07:37.954
- I did say I had to ask you first.
- To terms you already agreed to.

07:39.122 --> 07:41.708
- Yes.
- You see why I have a problem with this?

07:41.875 --> 07:45.128
Do we need food or not?
We are on the verge of rationing.

07:45.295 --> 07:48.798
Much as I'd like to devote every mission
to tava beans...

07:48.965 --> 07:52.760
I get your point. Tell them we agree.

08:02.353 --> 08:05.732
We give thanks for a plentiful harvest.

08:05.899 --> 08:07.984
<i>(all) We give thanks.</i>

08:08.151 --> 08:11.112
May next season be as fruitful.

08:11.279 --> 08:15.408
And... to our new friends.

08:15.575 --> 08:17.994
New friends.

08:23.625 --> 08:26.211
Moonshine?

08:28.796 --> 08:30.882
I thought you were man enough.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.894
- You have no idea which way.
- I'm getting my bearings.

08:43.061 --> 08:47.065
Translation: I'm lost.
They were very clear which route to take.

08:47.232 --> 08:51.194
- I prefer straight lines.
- Everything's a short cut in your world.

08:51.361 --> 08:54.822
- OK. Here it is again.
- What?

08:55.990 --> 08:58.785
I'm picking up a strange reading
from over there.

09:00.912 --> 09:04.415
- Define strange.
- You don't know what strange means?

09:04.582 --> 09:06.668
- Of course.
- Weird, freakish, odd...

09:06.834 --> 09:09.879
I'm trying to see if
it's worth getting off the route.

09:10.046 --> 09:12.715
Radioactive readings in an Amish world.
Your call.

09:12.882 --> 09:15.635
- We're lost anyway.
- I am not lost.

09:17.011 --> 09:20.682
All right. Let's check it out.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.096
- That is definitely...
- Strange.

10:00.263 --> 10:03.224
- Not that Amish, really.
- Not so much.

10:03.391 --> 10:06.019
Maybe they don't even know it's here.

10:07.812 --> 10:10.648
This hatch has been oiled recently.

10:10.815 --> 10:13.276
- We have to check it out.
- Really?

10:13.443 --> 10:15.612
Of course we do.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.669
- All right.
- Great.

10:38.551 --> 10:43.973
The construction's architecturally
advanced. I don't think they made this.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.809
We need to tell Ford where we are.

10:46.976 --> 10:49.062
Lieutenant, come in.

10:50.271 --> 10:53.483
- Ford?
- The place is built like a bunker.

10:53.650 --> 10:56.110
It must be shielded for RF.

10:56.277 --> 10:58.780
The reading's stronger this way.

11:00.532 --> 11:02.784
- What kind of readings?
- Palm readings.

11:02.951 --> 11:05.411
- McKay.
- It's neutron radiation.

11:05.578 --> 11:08.456
It's definitely a powerful energy source.

11:08.623 --> 11:11.876
OK. Let's check it out.

11:13.628 --> 11:17.131
I really think we should get out of here.

11:46.119 --> 11:48.204
Now, this is strange.

12:04.345 --> 12:06.973
<i>(chatter and laughter)</i>

12:16.816 --> 12:19.569
Excuse me.
I must go and tend to a dispute.

12:19.736 --> 12:23.281
- Is everything all right, Cowen?
- I will return shortly.

12:31.414 --> 12:34.292
Maybe they exist
as two separate cultures.

12:34.459 --> 12:37.045
Maybe.

12:37.212 --> 12:39.380
Who cares?

12:40.381 --> 12:42.926
How long you boys planning
on keeping us here?

12:44.886 --> 12:49.599
If people could just learn to keep
their secret underground hatches locked...

12:55.313 --> 12:58.858
So much for two separate cultures.

13:07.283 --> 13:09.702
What am I going to do?

13:17.377 --> 13:20.588
- I'm getting a weird vibe all of a sudden.
- I agree.

13:20.755 --> 13:24.259
I've never seen the Genii behave this way.

13:28.721 --> 13:31.182
Listen, we're just gonna step outside

13:31.349 --> 13:34.727
and see if Major Sheppard
and Dr McKay are back.

13:34.894 --> 13:37.939
- No one must leave.
- There's a Wraith ship in the area.

13:38.106 --> 13:41.776
Wraith? Are you serious?

13:45.196 --> 13:48.032
- We must warn our friends.
- You'll draw them to us.

13:48.199 --> 13:50.159
Everyone must stay indoors.

14:04.799 --> 14:07.927
Can we be careful with that?
It's fragile and if it...

14:10.305 --> 14:12.223
We have a problem.

14:12.390 --> 14:14.976
Then we have something in common.

14:15.143 --> 14:18.229
Normally you would be shot
for discovering our secret.

14:18.396 --> 14:21.190
And our people would question
our disappearance.

14:21.357 --> 14:23.526
We would say the Wraith took you.

14:23.693 --> 14:26.946
With no evidence to the contrary,
they would believe us.

14:29.282 --> 14:31.409
You were saying.

14:31.576 --> 14:35.622
You have technology,
knowledge new to us.

14:35.788 --> 14:39.542
- This C4 of yours...
- It's not for blowing up stumps.

14:41.336 --> 14:44.130
We have a more sophisticated
application for it.

14:44.297 --> 14:47.926
What you people do with your C4
is none of our business.

14:48.092 --> 14:50.178
We just need food.

14:50.345 --> 14:53.890
As far as your secret
down here goes, well...

14:54.057 --> 14:56.976
We say,
"What giant underground bunker?"

14:58.561 --> 15:00.855
I want more than that.

15:01.022 --> 15:03.900
Well, maybe we can give you more.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.319
You have weapons
more powerful than C4?

15:06.486 --> 15:09.072
Are you kidding? Weapons R Us. We...

15:10.365 --> 15:13.034
We might.

15:13.201 --> 15:16.079
What if I wanted more than weapons?

15:16.246 --> 15:20.416
Did I mention that I know almost
everything about almost everything?

15:20.583 --> 15:25.171
For Teyla Emmagan to have joined you,
you must have something much more.

15:25.338 --> 15:30.260
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
we're looking for allies against the Wraith.

15:30.426 --> 15:32.554
How about you guys?

15:36.849 --> 15:39.310
- We wanna go outside.
- We can't let you.

15:39.477 --> 15:45.024
- It's not safe.
- We can take care of ourselves.

15:45.191 --> 15:48.111
<i>- (Cowen) Tyrus, please respond.
- Receiving.</i>

15:49.070 --> 15:52.740
<i>- Bring them.
- Understood.</i>

15:52.907 --> 15:55.285
Relinquish your weapons.

15:57.996 --> 16:00.081
You will not be harmed.

16:02.041 --> 16:04.586
You guys are full of surprises.

16:20.935 --> 16:23.187
You missed
a hell of a harvest ceremony.

16:23.354 --> 16:25.398
I can imagine.

16:25.565 --> 16:28.484
- Oh, Teyla.
- I'm as surprised as you by all of this.

16:28.651 --> 16:30.528
I'm pretty surprised.

16:30.695 --> 16:34.657
Teyla knows us only
as the simple farmers we show outsiders.

16:34.824 --> 16:39.078
The secrecy of who and what we are
is our only defence against the Wraith.

16:41.122 --> 16:44.000
One day all that will change.

16:46.211 --> 16:49.130
You think you can do that
with an atomic bomb?

16:51.758 --> 16:53.843
Now it's you who surprise me.

16:54.010 --> 16:56.638
Radioactive readings,
a fascination with C4...

16:56.804 --> 17:00.558
- You're just mentioning this now?
- It just came to me.

17:00.725 --> 17:04.729
I assume you hope our C4
will solve your supercriticality problem.

17:04.896 --> 17:06.731
- Will it?
- It might.

17:06.897 --> 17:09.150
Depends on your designs.

17:09.317 --> 17:13.488
- You know how to make an A-bomb?
- Most of my school chess team could.

17:13.655 --> 17:17.909
The hard part is having sufficient
fissional materials of appropriate grade.

17:18.076 --> 17:21.204
- And we do.
- You do?

17:21.371 --> 17:25.290
The Genii were once
a great confederation of planets.

17:25.458 --> 17:30.713
Millennia ago the Wraith had driven us
to the brink of total annihilation.

17:31.631 --> 17:34.926
Our forefathers sought the protection
of bunkers like these,

17:35.093 --> 17:38.054
originally created for wars long forgotten.

17:38.221 --> 17:41.891
And it was here
that a small number of our people

17:42.058 --> 17:44.644
managed to survive undetected.

17:47.230 --> 17:51.276
Over the course of many, many years,
generation after generation,

17:51.442 --> 17:55.738
we have made technological
developments here in secret.

17:55.905 --> 18:00.118
So the whole farmer thing is just a front?

18:00.285 --> 18:03.746
- So the Wraith do not suspect?
- More than that.

18:03.913 --> 18:07.166
We do have many mouths to feed below.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.502
I want to show you something. Come.

18:09.669 --> 18:14.132
That thing you so carelessly threw
on the table. Can I take that along?

18:17.302 --> 18:19.387
Come.

18:20.346 --> 18:22.432
Stay as you are.

18:31.900 --> 18:36.571
Down below, our military trains
as our scientists create weapons for them.

18:36.738 --> 18:41.534
With our atomic weapon we believe
we can defeat the Wraith once and for all.

18:41.701 --> 18:44.954
You realise long-term exposure
to radiation is dangerous?

18:45.121 --> 18:47.457
Our scientists tell me otherwise.

18:47.624 --> 18:50.418
- Well, they're wrong.
- Are we in danger now?

18:50.585 --> 18:55.173
It would take weeks at these levels,
but I assume the Genii spend weeks here.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.259
Many of our people
have spent their entire lives here.

18:58.426 --> 19:00.511
Their entire short lives.

19:00.678 --> 19:05.099
We'll be fine, as long as
you weren't planning on having children.

19:06.851 --> 19:11.022
You're on the right track.
We're about 60 years ahead of you.

19:11.189 --> 19:15.151
That is if you survive.
This shielding is woefully inadequate.

19:15.318 --> 19:18.988
Now, uranium. How much do you have?

19:19.155 --> 19:22.200
- Much more.
- It's nowhere near weapons grade.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.911
We have had problems
in our purifying efforts.

19:25.078 --> 19:27.705
The molecular structure
of the unwanted material

19:27.872 --> 19:29.874
is like that of the desired material.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.794
Diffusion. You must separate
the 235 from the 238.

19:32.961 --> 19:37.340
If you remove the barrier between
two substances they split at different rates.

19:37.507 --> 19:39.592
- You could do this?
- Of course.

19:39.759 --> 19:46.558
I think the real question is, right now,
are we allies or are we still prisoners?

19:52.397 --> 19:55.275
We give thanks to our new friends.

19:55.441 --> 19:57.777
<i>(all) We give thanks.</i>

20:01.739 --> 20:03.825
Please eat.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.960
- You think there's lemon in this?
- I'm sure it's delicious.

20:14.127 --> 20:16.921
- Have you seen anaphylactic shock?
- Eat.

20:17.088 --> 20:22.468
I hope that by sharing in this meal
we can make up for past offences.

20:22.635 --> 20:25.305
I'm sure we'll get along just fine.

20:28.057 --> 20:30.435
What method did your people use

20:30.602 --> 20:34.063
to initiate fission reaction
in your prototype devices?

20:34.230 --> 20:36.107
There's two different approaches.

20:36.274 --> 20:38.359
Implosion and a gun-type bomb.

20:38.526 --> 20:41.112
- Both create a supercritical mass.
- Obviously.

20:41.279 --> 20:44.616
Either way you go
you need an amount of refined 235,

20:44.782 --> 20:48.786
roughly equivalent to the size of my fist.

20:48.953 --> 20:51.039
Or his fist, actually.

20:51.206 --> 20:54.751
Well, our dreams may soon be a reality.

20:56.628 --> 20:59.589
With your help, before the next culling,

20:59.756 --> 21:02.592
we plan to vaporise the Wraith
as they sleep.

21:07.388 --> 21:09.891
What exactly is your plan?

21:10.058 --> 21:13.436
We intend to take advantage
of their overconfidence.

21:13.603 --> 21:17.148
- That is their weakness.
- Overconfidence.

21:17.315 --> 21:20.485
They hibernate between cullings
aboard their great ships.

21:20.652 --> 21:22.529
Sometimes for centuries at a time.

21:22.695 --> 21:25.907
Wraith watch over the sleepers,
but they're small in number.

21:26.074 --> 21:27.909
Small enough to be overpowered.

21:28.076 --> 21:31.412
- We will sneak aboard with weapons.
- It may not be possible.

21:31.579 --> 21:35.833
Teyla, we should listen to their whole plan
before poking holes in it.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.920
If we are to work together,
they need to trust us

21:39.087 --> 21:41.422
and we need to trust them.

21:41.589 --> 21:44.467
Please explain.

21:44.634 --> 21:48.012
I and several of my people
were captured by the Wraith.

21:48.930 --> 21:52.016
It was a rescue mission to save us.

21:52.183 --> 21:55.270
I am only alive today thanks to them.

21:57.105 --> 22:00.525
- As a result of that rescue...
- You awakened the others.

22:00.692 --> 22:03.862
They found out there were more people
where we came from.

22:04.028 --> 22:07.949
- Father, they will all awaken.
- We took one of them prisoner.

22:08.116 --> 22:12.745
- The next culling should be decades off.
- They said they'd take their time.

22:12.912 --> 22:17.500
We had hoped to test our first
atomic weapon five years from now.

22:18.835 --> 22:20.753
Do we have that much time?

22:23.673 --> 22:26.551
Do we?

22:26.718 --> 22:28.845
No.

22:47.697 --> 22:49.657
- Cowen.
- They may detect the radiation.

22:49.824 --> 22:53.369
We must shut down the reactors,
survive the culling, plan for the next.

22:53.536 --> 22:56.664
You're forgetting something.
We're on the same side.

22:56.831 --> 23:02.295
Ha! Once we have extracted
all the information we can from you,

23:02.462 --> 23:04.756
you will be left on the surface.

23:04.923 --> 23:07.634
You'll be the first the Wraith feed upon.

23:07.800 --> 23:11.012
- I've won against Wraith ships.
- I've seen your weapons.

23:11.179 --> 23:14.182
I'm talking about a ship.
One that flies through space.

23:14.349 --> 23:17.018
With weapons
beyond anything you've ever seen.

23:17.185 --> 23:19.437
You wanna turn down that kind of help?

23:19.604 --> 23:24.192
- I think you're trying to save yourself.
- You're damn right I am.

23:24.359 --> 23:28.404
I say we work together,
then maybe help save each other.

23:28.571 --> 23:31.658
We both want the same thing.

23:35.912 --> 23:38.915
We were confident
the Wraith would not appear for years.

23:39.082 --> 23:40.959
They will detect us like you did.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.419
- If we work together...
- You've done enough!

23:43.586 --> 23:46.756
We haven't started.
I can get your programme back on track.

23:46.923 --> 23:51.094
- How?
- I built an atomic bomb in sixth grade.

23:51.261 --> 23:54.097
- You could do that in Canada?
- Not a working model.

23:54.264 --> 23:58.726
I was questioned by the CIA who thought
I was part of a secret organisation...

23:58.893 --> 24:00.853
<i>(door bangs)</i>

24:05.275 --> 24:08.570
Major Sheppard has convinced me
that we may yet prevail.

24:08.736 --> 24:10.321
He has?

24:11.322 --> 24:13.116
If we work together.

24:19.873 --> 24:25.920
Many generations ago, during a culling,
the Genii shot down a Wraith dart.

24:26.087 --> 24:28.715
Although many lives were lost that day,

24:28.882 --> 24:32.844
the ability to resist,
even in some small way,

24:33.011 --> 24:36.639
gave the Genii the seeds of hope.

24:38.516 --> 24:41.895
This data storage device
was recovered from that Wraith dart.

24:42.061 --> 24:46.274
- Like flash memory in a jump drive.
- It has information about the hive ship.

24:46.441 --> 24:50.069
Tyrus and his daughter
successfully accessed that information.

24:50.236 --> 24:52.280
- How?
- Through this interface.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.909
Really?

24:56.075 --> 25:01.080
We believe this is
where a Wraith ship still sleeps.

25:01.247 --> 25:05.460
The Wraith tend to self-destruct.
It's rare to get something like this.

25:05.627 --> 25:08.588
- Can you access other data?
- With this interface device,

25:08.755 --> 25:12.217
we believe we can access
the Wraith ship's data core.

25:13.593 --> 25:15.678
This is what your plan is based on?

25:15.845 --> 25:18.056
How does access to their computer help?

25:18.223 --> 25:22.060
With this interface device we can learn
all the Wraith ships' locations.

25:22.227 --> 25:24.771
So you know
where to deliver your new bombs.

25:24.938 --> 25:28.483
- Makes sense.
- Assuming this ship is still there.

25:28.650 --> 25:32.529
If the Wraith are in no hurry
to rally their forces, it will be.

25:32.695 --> 25:35.907
This ship is nowhere near the Stargate.

25:36.074 --> 25:38.952
Approaching it undetected by foot
is impossible.

25:39.118 --> 25:42.872
That is where your ship comes in,
Major Sheppard.

25:47.919 --> 25:50.922
Always wondered where my ship
would come in.

25:51.089 --> 25:55.176
- No. How's that for an answer?
- It's pithy. I'll give you that.

25:55.343 --> 25:59.180
- I'm sure you already agreed to this.
- We'll get something out of it.

25:59.347 --> 26:03.434
- We do need allies.
- But they were ready to string you up.

26:03.601 --> 26:07.605
- How can you trust them?
- Hey, I don't trust 'em.

26:07.772 --> 26:12.485
They insisted McKay and Teyla stay there,
not just to help with the bomb.

26:12.652 --> 26:14.988
We have something they need
and vice versa.

26:15.154 --> 26:18.074
- I thought that's what negotiating's about.
- It is.

26:18.241 --> 26:20.827
But I stop short
of offering nuclear weapons.

26:20.994 --> 26:25.123
- They were building them anyway.
- Why didn't you just say so?

26:27.250 --> 26:30.086
You realise
I originally sent you out for food?

26:31.087 --> 26:34.090
- I think we can still get that.
- I don't see why not.

26:34.257 --> 26:38.052
We kind of moved past it
with the atomic bomb thing.

26:39.804 --> 26:42.223
Bottom line. Can you pull this off?

26:42.390 --> 26:44.475
We'll have to watch our backs.

26:44.642 --> 26:48.813
But I wouldn't put my team at risk
if I didn't think so.

26:52.984 --> 26:54.861
OK, go.

26:55.028 --> 26:58.198
And then maybe we'll talk
about making nuclear bombs.

27:02.785 --> 27:05.455
The encasement directs
the explosive forces inward

27:05.622 --> 27:08.875
and the implosion
creates extreme compression.

27:09.042 --> 27:12.253
The subcritical mass
becomes supercritical.

27:12.420 --> 27:14.297
- Ingenious.
- I know.

27:14.464 --> 27:17.133
Can you believe
I didn't win the science fair?

27:17.300 --> 27:20.929
The adaptation of equipment
and resources will be the challenge.

27:22.764 --> 27:26.434
You're destined to become a hero
among our people, Dr McKay.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.686
Right.

27:28.853 --> 27:33.024
As long as Major Sheppard
returns with the C4.

27:36.903 --> 27:39.572
I'm a dead man.

27:39.739 --> 27:42.408
We have surprised each other.

27:42.575 --> 27:45.912
- The Genii are not the people I thought.
- And look at you.

27:46.079 --> 27:48.748
I'd never have thought
you'd leave your people.

27:48.915 --> 27:51.209
No, I do this for them.

27:51.376 --> 27:55.338
John Sheppard and his people have
brought new hope to our stars, Sora.

27:55.505 --> 27:58.633
They have the spirit of explorers
and hearts of warriors.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.928
They have accepted me. But look at you.

28:02.095 --> 28:04.931
How many harvest ceremonies
did I make you endure?

28:05.098 --> 28:07.267
Never again, I promise you.

28:17.026 --> 28:20.697
You respected us for who we were.
That gave us reason to trust you.

28:20.864 --> 28:24.701
I'm saddened you could not trust me
enough to share in your secret.

28:24.868 --> 28:30.206
- That is our way.
- Our deception is a matter of survival.

28:30.373 --> 28:33.877
It is a secret we are born into
and take to our graves.

28:34.043 --> 28:37.046
- Still...
- Have we not traded fairly with you?

28:38.381 --> 28:41.551
We have not dealt with others
so graciously.

28:42.594 --> 28:45.471
Perhaps this new alliance
will open your eyes.

28:45.638 --> 28:49.767
That we can only stand against the Wraith
if we do so together.

28:51.895 --> 28:55.356
We'll have to see if your friends
live up to their promises.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.920
Well? Do you see?

29:21.758 --> 29:24.052
Let's get in and out as fast as possible.

29:24.219 --> 29:27.555
- I've studied these plans all my life.
- Good.

29:27.722 --> 29:31.559
We'll follow your lead. We'll cover you
during the breach and download.

29:31.726 --> 29:34.479
- Exit plan?
- As we came in. Stay with the jumper.

29:34.646 --> 29:36.481
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going with you.

29:36.648 --> 29:38.816
We could end up in a fire-fight.

29:38.983 --> 29:43.655
Sora is a skilled fighter
and expert marksman, Lieutenant Ford.

29:43.821 --> 29:49.285
Still, she must stay here
to carry on if we don't come back.

30:06.678 --> 30:11.015
We need you to deliver the C4
you promised us before we proceed.

30:11.182 --> 30:13.643
We need to get the proper intel first.

30:13.810 --> 30:17.397
No use in building a bunch of nukes
if we can't put them to use.

30:17.564 --> 30:21.025
- Those are your terms?
- I'm sure you understand.

30:21.192 --> 30:25.780
I do. It seems we have no choice
but to trust each other.

30:46.968 --> 30:49.929
How many of these ships do you have?

30:50.763 --> 30:52.682
Just the one.

31:02.150 --> 31:04.235
There.

31:06.571 --> 31:09.490
- Have they awoken?
- I don't see any activity.

31:10.658 --> 31:13.369
Same as last time.

31:14.579 --> 31:17.832
All right, here we go.
Right through the front door.

31:39.145 --> 31:41.940
- Hey, hold the fort.
- Yes, sir.

31:42.106 --> 31:44.192
Good luck.

32:23.648 --> 32:25.859
<i>(McKay) Oh, God.</i>

32:32.282 --> 32:38.454
These people were cocooned for a later
feeding. Some of them may still be alive.

32:39.622 --> 32:43.042
- We don't have time for this.
- They could be your people.

32:47.881 --> 32:53.261
Teyla, take care of this. We'll meet you
back at the ship. McKay, you're with me.

32:59.350 --> 33:03.146
I'll stay with her. Go.
We'll meet you back at the ship.

33:48.858 --> 33:51.694
This is it.

33:51.861 --> 33:56.074
But the ship's plans I memorised
did not show how to operate this door.

33:58.535 --> 34:01.371
Blowing this door
will make too much noise.

34:01.538 --> 34:05.124
So find another way. OK.

34:09.837 --> 34:11.922
<i>(beeping)</i>

34:14.551 --> 34:16.010
<i>(rapid beeping)</i>

34:16.177 --> 34:18.972
Can I get some light here?

34:38.658 --> 34:41.119
Beautiful.

34:51.629 --> 34:54.172
<i>(screaming) Please!</i>

34:54.340 --> 34:57.092
- Help me!
- We're gonna get you out.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.095
- Help me!
- What are you doing?

34:59.262 --> 35:01.347
- We can save none of them.
- What?

35:01.514 --> 35:03.308
Please help!

35:03.474 --> 35:06.728
- You'd let him die?
- The Wraith must not know we were here.

35:06.895 --> 35:09.439
I said no!

35:09.606 --> 35:11.191
I beg you!

35:18.615 --> 35:23.119
- McKay, we don't have...
- I don't even know if this is gonna...

35:26.706 --> 35:28.791
...work.

35:35.590 --> 35:38.134
Bingo.

35:38.301 --> 35:40.637
All right.

35:40.803 --> 35:43.264
I'll cover your six. Go.

35:51.147 --> 35:54.817
- If you free him, they will know.
- You are not the man I thought.

35:54.984 --> 35:58.112
The Genii will be the first to die
if they awaken.

35:58.279 --> 36:00.532
- Help me!
- I said leave him.

36:00.698 --> 36:03.368
- No!
- Be silent!

36:03.535 --> 36:06.412
<i>(screams)</i>

36:19.092 --> 36:21.678
<i>(Teyla) Major, we've been discovered.</i>

36:21.844 --> 36:23.555
We gotta get outta here.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.566
We've got it.

36:45.910 --> 36:49.455
Wraith guards. Hurry, more are coming.

37:02.343 --> 37:05.555
- Where's Tyrus?
- He was struck by a Wraith weapon.

37:05.722 --> 37:09.017
- He may have been stunned.
- The Wraith will be upon him.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.728
<i>(artillery fire)</i>

37:13.479 --> 37:17.483
- Go. Go!
- All right. Hang on.

37:17.650 --> 37:19.903
<i>(engines powering up)</i>

38:04.364 --> 38:06.783
Where is my father?

38:09.077 --> 38:11.162
He did not survive.

38:11.329 --> 38:15.124
How? What happened?

38:15.291 --> 38:17.877
I think we should find out.

38:19.128 --> 38:21.047
Take aim!

38:35.395 --> 38:38.857
Cowen, I thought we were learning
how to get along.

38:39.023 --> 38:42.110
- She killed Tyrus.
- No.

38:42.277 --> 38:45.989
By leaving him to die
you may as well have killed him yourself.

38:46.155 --> 38:50.577
- He shot the man we tried to save.
- It was a mistake to save anyone.

38:50.743 --> 38:52.954
It jeopardised the mission.

38:55.957 --> 38:59.669
We will keep this intelligence information.

38:59.836 --> 39:01.838
You're the one making a mistake.

39:02.005 --> 39:06.009
And your ship. And whatever quantities
of C4 you possess.

39:06.175 --> 39:08.595
That is all you ever intended. To use us.

39:10.138 --> 39:12.974
And for your efforts I will spare your lives.

39:13.141 --> 39:15.226
Generous of you.

39:15.393 --> 39:17.937
I guess the tava beans are off the table.

39:18.104 --> 39:22.567
- Your weapons.
- No. I don't think so.

39:24.402 --> 39:26.571
We have the advantage, Major.

39:28.239 --> 39:30.325
Yeah.

39:31.451 --> 39:33.661
This is what your father died for?

39:35.663 --> 39:40.251
In the name of people who would lie
and steal from those they call friends?

39:42.879 --> 39:47.342
I lied too.
Jumpers Two and Three, execute.

39:57.227 --> 40:01.147
You didn't really think
we had one ship, did you?

40:01.314 --> 40:04.984
Tell your people to get back
and nobody gets hurt.

40:06.903 --> 40:10.365
Jumper Two, prepare to fire on my mark.

40:10.532 --> 40:12.992
Wait!

40:15.453 --> 40:18.081
Do you promise to leave?

40:19.123 --> 40:21.501
Well, that's the plan.

40:22.919 --> 40:26.548
I guess we'll have to go somewhere else
to find our tava beans.

40:26.714 --> 40:31.886
But I think it's only fair
we end up with something.

40:34.806 --> 40:38.476
You do not want
to make an enemy of the Genii.

40:38.643 --> 40:43.439
You know what? Same here.

41:09.257 --> 41:12.886
Major, I thought you might like to see this.

41:13.636 --> 41:18.516
A lot of the information from the device
was encrypted, so we're still working on it.

41:18.683 --> 41:20.059
It's not easy.

41:20.226 --> 41:25.023
We've discovered 21 Wraith hive ships
in our quadrant of the Pegasus galaxy.

41:25.190 --> 41:28.568
- 21?
- There are indications of more elsewhere.

41:28.735 --> 41:32.030
- How many more?
- There's no way of knowing for sure.

41:32.197 --> 41:35.074
Perhaps 60... or more.

41:36.451 --> 41:39.412
- A lot of ships.
- Some appear to be on the move.

41:39.579 --> 41:42.582
- Toward us?
- We're still working on that.

41:42.749 --> 41:45.627
Even if we helped the Genii
build nuclear warheads...

41:45.793 --> 41:49.255
We only could have nuked
a handful of them simultaneously.

41:49.422 --> 41:52.550
There's too many Wraith ships
for a coordinated attack.

41:52.717 --> 41:56.346
The Genii plan never would have worked,
with or without our help.

41:56.512 --> 41:59.641
- I'll see what else I can find.
- Thank you, Peter.

42:04.187 --> 42:09.442
Sergeant Bates brokered a small trade
agreement for food while you were gone.

42:09.609 --> 42:13.905
- Oh, he did, did he?
- Yes, he did, but it's not a competition.

42:14.072 --> 42:18.910
- So who are these people?
- Traders. They call themselves Manarians.

42:21.871 --> 42:26.459
I'm sorry you weren't able to find
the allies you were looking for, John.

42:26.626 --> 42:28.920
We gathered some valuable intel.

42:29.087 --> 42:32.674
Huh. Are you trying to convince me
this is good news?

42:32.840 --> 42:35.969
I much prefer to know
what we're up against than not.

42:36.135 --> 42:39.222
60 ships... or more.

42:43.017 --> 42:45.603
I just hope they don't all come at once.
