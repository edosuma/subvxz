Um, hello? Erika?

00:20.729 --> 00:21.730
Ricardo?

00:21.813 --> 00:23.481
You never visit me here.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.901
Uh, I wanted to talk to you about Cat.
My parents say

00:26.985 --> 00:30.113
I can't bring him for the move.
So I was hoping you could take him?

00:30.196 --> 00:33.908
-Maybe train Cat in that cat circus?
-You named your cat Cat?

00:33.992 --> 00:39.789
I tried Mr. Meow-Face and Feline Fury,
but Cat is the only thing he answers to.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.833
Whoever owned him before
wasn't creative.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.086
-I didn't know you were a painter.
-[meows]

00:45.170 --> 00:47.422
These are... interesting.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.925
I'm going through some things.
Working them out in my head.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.846
This is what my emotions look like.
Kinda messy, I guess.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.183
You know what I like about you?
You're not cool.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.519
Okay, wow. Total big thanks for that one.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.939
That came out wrong. I mean,
you're okay with being who you are,

01:05.023 --> 01:06.858
no matter what anyone else thinks.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.443
That's a better kind of cool.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.446
Nathan and Jake
are really gonna miss you, Ricardo.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.783
And so am I. Cat will be in good hands.

for that one.

[Number Six] Delta Team,
secure the perimeter.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.814
Whoa! The cavalry arrives!

05:56.898 --> 05:59.150
By cavalry, I mean the people
who wanna put us in prison.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.276
[Number Six] Abort!

06:03.279 --> 06:06.449
<i>We've driven the Tech Men from the silos.</i>
<i>They're attempting an escape,</i>

06:06.532 --> 06:07.992
<i>but we can apprehend most of them.</i>

06:08.076 --> 06:10.912
Cancel that, Kane. Your primary objectives
are the Flex Fighters.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.747
<i>You're asking us to switch priorities?</i>

06:12.830 --> 06:15.333
You heard me.
Do not let the Flex Fighters escape.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.668
<i>With all due respect, Mr. Rook,</i>
<i>that's crazy!</i>

06:17.752 --> 06:21.089
<i>Shouldn't the culprits stealing power</i>
<i>be the higher priority?</i>

06:21.631 --> 06:24.258
Reynolds, you are not in command.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.720
The Flex Fighters have caused
far more damage than anyone else.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.680
Do not let them escape.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.641
Target designation acknowledged, sir.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.186
Reynolds! What was that?
You do not break the chain of command.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.396
Come on, Kane. Even you have to admit

06:37.480 --> 06:39.524
Rook's too obsessed
with the Flex Fighters.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.983
Rook is in charge.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.403
Do not force me to reconsider
your position with our security team.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.033
[Ricardo] Man, these crabs are fast!

06:49.117 --> 06:51.702
Rook's gotta be mad
he didn't invent these things first.

Whoa! [grunts]

07:21.816 --> 07:23.192
Good. Some back-up.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.529
Whoa! Tell our back-up to back up!

07:28.197 --> 07:29.449
Are you guys insane?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.076
Can't you find a better target,

the super-science
mega-villains shooting up the city?

07:36.372 --> 07:39.542
Fighting us instead of the Tech Men?
What are you guys doing?

my ear drums have ever stretched.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.691
Guys? Uh, guys?

08:04.984 --> 08:07.737
Blindstrike, you're okay.
Where are Omni-Mass and Wingspan?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.322
Not sure, the blast--

08:20.458 --> 08:23.503
<i>Tech Men. With them gone,</i>
<i>Rook will focus on us. Evac!</i>

08:23.586 --> 08:25.922
Without our friends? No way.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.926
[Blindstrike]<i> There's no trace of them.</i>

08:30.009 --> 08:33.596
We'll have better luck finding them
if we aren't captured ourselves. Let's go.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.185
Guys, come in. Guys! Still nothing.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.521
We need to reach Dr. C. She can help.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.276
[chirrups]

08:49.904 --> 08:51.030
There was a big bad boom

08:51.113 --> 08:53.950
and then Omni-Mass and Wingspan
were, like, nowhere!

08:54.033 --> 08:56.035
Did Kane arrest them?
Did the Tech Men destroy them?

08:56.118 --> 08:58.955
I've been trying to hack
into Rook's communication systems,

08:59.038 --> 09:01.290
but there's unusual activity
on the network.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.962
It's no use. There's no way
to get any info from Rook Tower.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.632
Actually, I might know a way.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.135
[Stretch]<i> I just hope</i>
<i>Omni and Wingspan are still alive.</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:14.220
[door hisses]

09:22.478 --> 09:24.689
[Nathan] Okay, that worked well. Right?

09:24.772 --> 09:28.526
I mean, if being surrounded by our enemies
counts as "working well".

09:28.609 --> 09:30.987
[Ricardo] We needed to do something
after that explosion.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.155
Stealing these uniforms
off unconscious Tech Men

09:33.239 --> 09:35.616
-was our only chance.
-[Nathan] Yeah, but now what?

09:35.700 --> 09:39.120
And do all Tech Men sweat this much?
Ah, gross.

09:39.203 --> 09:41.872
Like wearing someone else's gym socks
all over my body.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.834
[Number Six] Quit wasting time.
Gather for the mission briefing.

09:44.917 --> 09:48.337
[Nathan] Oh, yeah! Mission briefing!
Love it! Ha!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.506
Not as much as I'd love
fresh clothes, though.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.469
[Number Six] I'm pleased to inform you
that all of the pieces are in place!

09:55.720 --> 09:59.640
Today, we will stand with Number One,
and our plans will be revealed.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.684
Now, to your stations.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.227
[cheering]

10:07.023 --> 10:08.816
[man] Sixty-Seven, what happened to you?

10:10.526 --> 10:11.652
[Nathan] What do you mean?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.238
You are approximately a foot shorter
than before.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.749
[Ricardo] Don't tell Number Six,
but that's not 67. He's 82.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.918
He forgot to clean his uniform
and 67 let him borrow his spare.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.672
Be cool, though, okay?
You know how intense Six can be.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.300
[man] Been there before. Won't say a word.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.013
[Nathan] How do you do that?

10:39.096 --> 10:41.557
[Ricardo] Dude, I've been the new kid
at enough schools

10:41.641 --> 10:45.019
to learn how to drop into social groups
like I've always been there.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.438
It's about getting quick reads
on the group's cues.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.982
[Nathan] But this place
isn't exactly high school.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.193
[Ricardo] A bunch of misfits
dressing the same,

10:52.276 --> 10:54.111
hoping the others will think they fit in,

10:54.195 --> 10:56.697
dealing with an elitist
top-down social dynamic?

10:56.781 --> 10:59.116
No, not like high school at all.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.663
[Nathan] Okay, but we need
to get out of here so, what do we do?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.873
[Ricardo] Same thing I do
every day at school.

11:05.956 --> 11:09.168
Walk around, looking like
I'm in the middle of something important,

11:09.251 --> 11:11.712
so no one in authority asks any questions.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.298
Then quietly
look for a chance to sneak out.

11:14.924 --> 11:18.260
If we're infiltrating Rook Tower,
shouldn't we do it undercover?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.846
This will be much easier. Trust me.

11:22.264 --> 11:25.893
[Jake] If Delta Team has any info
on what happened to Nathan and Ricardo,

11:25.976 --> 11:27.645
we'll find it here.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.814
That's right, deploy the full contingent.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.819
Vic, someone just walked in my office.
Let me call you back.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.154
-[beeps]
-Jake, what a surprise.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.281
And wonderful to see you again,
Ms. Dashti.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.951
-What brings you here?
-Just popping through to say hi.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.829
We were in the area,
volunteering on Grandpa Park's newspaper.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.914
Good to see you keeping active.
Out of trouble.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.167
Sir, a moment of your time?
It's about Field Agent Santos.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.712
Gotta deal with this, son.
Be back in a few minutes.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.717
Before I go, Jake, I've seen you
around this girl a couple of times now.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.595
-Is she someone... special?
-Um...

12:01.679 --> 12:04.432
Maybe you should invite her over
for supper some night?

12:04.515 --> 12:06.684
Uh... Sure. Sure, Dad.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.442
-[sighs]
-What was that all about?

12:14.525 --> 12:16.694
Huh? Nothing. Come on, let's hurry.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.781
He's already logged on. We have access
to the Rook Unlimited system.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.283
Kind of risky, isn't it?

12:22.366 --> 12:24.285
-Not if we're fast.
-I didn't mean getting caught.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.496
I meant that you never really know
what weird secrets you'll uncover

12:27.580 --> 12:30.249
-in someone's computer history.
-I know what I'll find.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.793
Lists of timetables. Endless schedules.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.380
Probably a file on what breakfast cereals
have optimum chew times.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.092
Wow. How did you not end up boring?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.719
[laughs awkwardly]

12:41.802 --> 12:45.139
We better see what we can find out
about Wingspan and Omni-Mass.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.057
Anything Rook knows, it'll be here.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.771
No recent arrest records. No bulletins.
I'm not seeing anything.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.149
[Jake] Not even in the security databases.

12:55.232 --> 12:59.820
The incident record reports
no, uh, bodies recovered. Nothing.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.489
It's like they just vanished.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.911
[Stretch] Dr. C could access
city security cameras...

13:06.994 --> 13:09.788
-[chirrups]
-[Stretch] What was that?

13:14.168 --> 13:17.630
<i>Dr. C, we just saw two</i>
<i>strange spherical bots in the sewers.</i>

13:17.713 --> 13:19.465
<i>Not sure of their purpose.</i>

13:19.548 --> 13:21.634
<i>Follow them.</i>
<i>We need to know what they are.</i>

13:21.717 --> 13:24.178
<i>-Of course, I have my suspicions.</i>
<i>-Copy that.</i>

13:24.512 --> 13:28.432
Sure. Nothing could go wrong
spying on suspicious bots in a sewer.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.185
This isn't anything to do with
the project your dad's working on?

13:32.394 --> 13:33.646
Nah.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.107
[chirrups]

13:40.819 --> 13:44.323
There you are!
Mr. Rook promised me a round two!

13:46.033 --> 13:48.869
Mechanica? Stay back, she's... Oh.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.626
[Blindstrike grunts]

13:55.709 --> 13:56.961
[gasps]

13:58.963 --> 13:59.838
Wow!

14:02.174 --> 14:03.384
[both grunt]

14:14.645 --> 14:17.106
Dr. C! We're under attack! It's Mechanica!

14:17.690 --> 14:19.984
[Dr. C]<i> Luckily, we've prepared for this.</i>

14:20.067 --> 14:21.569
Sending in the special weapon.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.034
[Blindstrike yells]

14:36.375 --> 14:38.836
That was fun. But the reunion's not over.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.463
Dr. C arranged for you
to meet another old friend.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.591
Come on, boy, fetch.

14:44.091 --> 14:47.761
My Hunter-Stretchipede! Come to me.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.140
-[snarls]
-What? No!

14:52.057 --> 14:54.184
[Mechanica screams]

14:54.643 --> 14:57.021
Dr. C programmed it to fight for us!

14:57.104 --> 14:59.523
You weren't the only one
looking forward to a round two.

15:02.943 --> 15:07.114
You can't beat all of Rook Unlimited.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.240
[grunts]

15:08.866 --> 15:09.867
[chirruping]

15:17.583 --> 15:20.628
Blindstrike, Stretch!
He has our position. We're found.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.963
Rook is coming!

15:24.423 --> 15:26.050
[chirruping]

15:31.347 --> 15:33.557
[Rook] We have it,
the Flex Fighters' secret base.

15:33.891 --> 15:37.394
Kane, all security,
converge on that location. Now!

15:37.478 --> 15:40.314
Sir, you mean everyone
except a contingency force in case--

15:40.397 --> 15:42.316
-Everyone. Now.
-But what if--?

15:42.399 --> 15:44.068
-You're done.
-What?

15:44.151 --> 15:46.236
-Fired. Gone.
-But--

15:46.320 --> 15:47.905
Get out of my tower!

15:48.948 --> 15:53.160
The entire Rook Unlimited Security force,
in that sewer, immediately!

15:59.249 --> 16:00.250
[both groan]

16:03.337 --> 16:04.672
We have to go, now!

16:05.089 --> 16:08.008
We can't leave this data behind.
You think Rook is dangerous now?

16:08.092 --> 16:10.427
Imagine what he could do
with all my research.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.930
Zero-One? Operation short circuit.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.100
Blindstrike, help with the wipe.

16:17.935 --> 16:18.936
Huh? What?

16:27.778 --> 16:29.363
[Nathan] The janitor's closet.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.032
Why aren't any of these doors
labeled "easy way out?"

16:32.116 --> 16:33.325
We need a sign.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.412
[Number Six] It's time.
Everyone report for deployment.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.080
[Nathan] Not the sign I was looking for.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.458
[Ricardo] No choice. We go along with
what's happening until we can get away.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.710
[crackling]

16:42.793 --> 16:44.420
[chirrups and beeps]

16:48.215 --> 16:50.384
-[beeping]
-They're here.

17:08.360 --> 17:09.445
[all grunt]

17:11.113 --> 17:12.448
[chirrups]

17:21.832 --> 17:23.125
[Rook]<i> I'll miss you, Dr. Cleo.</i>

17:24.460 --> 17:28.255
You were a worthy mentor,
and an even more worthy opponent.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.631
-[power clicks off]
-What?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.967
Ah, come on.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.511
IT? Come in.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.930
Ferguson? Browning? Anyone?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.724
[weapons power up]

17:40.976 --> 17:44.772
Tech Men?
You're challenging the wrong genius, guys.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.233
[Number Six] Don't move, Rook.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.737
Not... one... inch.

17:51.820 --> 17:55.991
Forty-two, eight, computer intrusion.
Sixteen, 89, restrain him, now.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.827
What do you think you're doing?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.454
[Number Six] Corporate takeover.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.373
Rook Unlimited
now belongs to the Tech Men.

18:03.749 --> 18:06.627
We've been setting the groundwork
for this for months,

18:07.044 --> 18:09.379
but you've been so obsessed
with the Flex Fighters,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.882
you never saw it coming.
In that way,

18:11.965 --> 18:15.302
you've been our greatest ally,
Jonathan Rook.

18:18.388 --> 18:22.392
[Nathan] Ordered to guard the door.
Sure, we'll guard it right outta here.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.685
[man] Sneaking away, huh?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.105
Well, don't worry,
I completely understand.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.440
[Nathan] You... do?

18:28.524 --> 18:30.275
[man] Sure. You want to see it happen.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.862
Don't worry, when Number One does it,
we'll get a good video feed.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.031
[Ricardo] Does what?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.325
[man] When he destroys Rook, of course.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.081
[Ricardo] This might be
our only chance to escape.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.959
And Rook's a terrible, awful man
who used us like pawns.

18:47.042 --> 18:51.380
[Nathan] He's a disaster of a human being
who's actively trying to obliterate us.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.216
[Ricardo] So, we're going to forget
trying to escape,

18:54.299 --> 18:55.926
and stay to save him, aren't we?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.804
[Nathan] Yeah.
That's probably what we're gonna do.

18:58.887 --> 19:02.516
[Ricardo] But how? Wish there was some way
to get word to Stretch and Blindstrike.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.434
Look!

19:06.937 --> 19:08.897
-[Nathan] Kane?
-[beeps]

19:11.066 --> 19:14.194
[Nathan] Nice, the Tech Men
are in big trouble now.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.864
[Ricardo] Especially with us
helping him. Let's go.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.170
[metallic squeak]

19:34.506 --> 19:35.382
Lift Bot!

19:37.050 --> 19:39.928
Lift Bot! Can you, uh, function?

19:40.304 --> 19:42.431
[chirrups and beeps]

19:43.640 --> 19:45.225
[beeps]

19:46.935 --> 19:47.811
[growls]

19:51.982 --> 19:52.983
[yells]

19:54.443 --> 19:59.281
Rook Security is the world's best.
This takeover won't last long.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.660
Ah, Kane.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.455
Perfect timing as always.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.249
Now, do what you do best.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.587
[Number Six] Welcome, Number One.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.884
[all] All hail, Number One!

20:19.509 --> 20:22.429
Kane, no. No!

20:22.721 --> 20:25.432
[Kane] Yes, absolutely.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.768
My patience, my discipline.

20:27.851 --> 20:32.940
Everything has finally paid off.
Rook Unlimited is mine.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.067
Not while I still breathe.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.074
[Kane] Goodbye, Mr. Rook.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.745
Are these guys re-spawning or something?
They never seem to end!

20:46.828 --> 20:47.913
[weapons power up]

20:49.665 --> 20:51.291
[men yell]

20:52.793 --> 20:54.836
Huh? Did we just win?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.672
Some kind of system-wide command,

20:56.755 --> 20:59.424
feedback shocking them unconscious
through their comms.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.302
It would have to have been broadcast
from Rook Tower.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.430
Scanners are picking up incoming.
Possibly a second round of attack.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.105
Yes! You guys are okay!
But where have you been?

21:13.188 --> 21:17.359
We'll explain all that later,
but first, we brought someone.

21:17.442 --> 21:21.488
And you're not going to like it,
but you have to hear him out, okay?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.827
I need your help.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.121
What?
