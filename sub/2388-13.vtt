00:01.668 --> 00:06.381
<i>Kids, in late 2012,
I received a very important text message.</i>

00:10.219 --> 00:13.555
<i>Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin
were engaged,</i>

00:13.639 --> 00:16.600
<i>marking a truly happy time
for our little group.</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:19.603
<i>The problem was...</i>

00:19.603 --> 00:22.397
<i>one of us was
definitely not happy.</i>

00:24.483 --> 00:26.109
Marvin will not
stop crying.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.445
What do you guys think it is?
Is he hungry?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.864
Well, that must be it.

00:30.948 --> 00:31.949
Huh!

00:31.949 --> 00:33.992
Thank you for thinking
of that, Ted.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.119
And here we were
just watering him

00:36.203 --> 00:37.871
and facing him
towards the sunlight.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.500
Sorry, I haven't slept in...

00:41.500 --> 00:42.709
January.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.170
Food going in isn't the problem,

00:45.254 --> 00:48.423
it's what's coming out,
or not coming out.

00:48.507 --> 00:49.716
He hasn't pooped
in three days.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.801
Yeah, normally

00:50.801 --> 00:52.594
I wouldn't wish one
of his dirty diapers

00:52.678 --> 00:56.056
on my worst enemy,
but now I kind of miss

00:56.056 --> 00:57.599
popping the hood
in the morning

00:57.683 --> 01:00.102
and finding that first
big juicy, black...

01:00.102 --> 01:02.980
Lily, I'm eating chili.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.857
I'm eating chili, Lily.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.733
Confetti.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.235
Big blast of confetti.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.821
Normally, the kid's
a confetti machine.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.156
He's Rip Taylor
in a diaper.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.825
I have a feeling
at this point, Rip Taylor

01:14.825 --> 01:16.451
is Rip Taylor in a diaper.

01:16.535 --> 01:19.997
- And with that image, dinner is done.
- Hey, guys.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.331
- Well, well, well.
- Hey.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.166
Here comes the bride.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.335
Now the annoying part, right?

01:25.419 --> 01:26.795
Planning the wedding?

01:26.879 --> 01:28.422
So not fun, right?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.174
I don't know. I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.009
Fine, I'll do it for you.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.219
First thing we need
to do is set a date.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.762
May 25, 2013.

01:35.846 --> 01:36.847
Thank you, Ted.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.015
The ladies are talking.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.474
Actually, that is the date.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.352
Ted offered to help
with the planning a little.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.189
And, well, uh...

01:45.189 --> 01:46.481
That's a big binder.

01:46.565 --> 01:47.816
Oh, this?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.193
This is just cakes.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.528
Anyway, we're having
the ceremony

01:51.612 --> 01:53.488
at that beautiful little
church out on Long Island,

01:53.572 --> 01:56.033
where Victoria almost got
married, lovely spot.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.702
And then we're gonna have a
reception in a big white tent

01:58.702 --> 02:00.245
on the front lawn
of the hotel.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.789
Oh, and, uh, the
colors are cream

02:02.873 --> 02:04.333
and lilac.

02:06.585 --> 02:07.836
I will cut you, bitch.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.962
No, L-L-Lily...

02:22.017 --> 02:24.394
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.355
I'm cool, I'm cool.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.856
Hey, Robin, where's Barney?

02:27.940 --> 02:29.816
Did he skip town already?

02:29.900 --> 02:32.277
If so, exactly
what time was it?

02:32.361 --> 02:34.488
It's important
for the over/under.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.283
Barney's fine, it's just...
Well, earlier this morning...

02:38.367 --> 02:41.662
So, it's been three days
since I said yes.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.746
True.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.830
And your panic
attacks are getting

02:43.914 --> 02:45.123
shorter and further apart.

02:45.207 --> 02:48.460
I can't do this!
I feel like I'm drowning!

02:49.795 --> 02:51.088
Also true.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.215
- So I guess we're officially engaged.
- Hmm.

02:53.215 --> 02:54.299
Maybe we should
tell our parents.

02:54.383 --> 02:56.301
I assume my dad already knows,
you did call him

02:56.385 --> 02:57.553
and got his permission, right?

02:57.553 --> 02:59.596
Yeah, yeah, Robin.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.350
I bought you with an ox
and some spices from the East.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.102
Uh, he's gonna put
you in a cage.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.397
and send you on horseback
to my remote desert camp.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.399
- Okay, Barney...
- Hold on, I'm not done.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.277
Where you'll be bathed
in perfumes and oils

03:13.277 --> 03:14.736
and delivered to my tent.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.154
After you perform
the traditional

03:16.238 --> 03:18.615
Dance of the Seven Veils,
we'll adjourn

03:18.699 --> 03:20.450
to the tiger skin
rug where we'll...

03:20.534 --> 03:21.952
- Barney...
- Robin!

03:21.952 --> 03:24.288
If we're gonna build
a marriage together,

03:24.288 --> 03:27.082
we have got to stop interrupting
each other all the time.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.792
Fine, finish your story.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.961
Thank you.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.839
Where we'll do it.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.008
Did you ask
for my father's permission?

03:36.008 --> 03:37.217
No, I did not.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.929
So, as some of you know,
my dad is a little scary.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.141
A little? Dude's a
stone cold Slytherin.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.226
He always looks like he
just came from slapping

03:46.310 --> 03:48.979
some guy tied to a
chair in a back room.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.772
Anyway, we go get lunch...

03:50.856 --> 03:52.649
Look, I know I already
told you this,

03:52.733 --> 03:55.527
but my dad is a scary guy.

03:55.611 --> 03:58.197
Please, I think
I can handle...

03:59.698 --> 04:01.617
Oh, vampire in the daylight,
vampire in the daylight!

04:01.617 --> 04:02.784
ROBIN
Oh, my God.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.371
Hello, Robin.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.706
Hello, sir.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.000
Put that thing away,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.168
Give your old man a hug.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.798
And then it got
really scary.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.008
I'm glad you could
meet me here

04:18.008 --> 04:20.511
at my favorite restaurant.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.055
Carol and I come
here all the time.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.224
I... you...

04:25.224 --> 04:27.392
When-Da...
Who's Carol?

04:27.476 --> 04:29.144
Oh, right,
you haven't met Carol, um...

04:30.229 --> 04:31.772
Very special woman.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.650
48 years old, dental
hygienist, no kids.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.276
Likes Zumba.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.404
She's the reason I moved
to New York City.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.823
Eight months ago.
Thanks for the call, by the way.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.951
Well, I figured you knew.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.119
It's on my Facebook page.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.664
You really should respond
to my friend request.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.791
I post a lot of great stuff.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.793
Are you familiar with memes?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.753
There's a cat who says,

04:54.837 --> 04:56.588
"I can has cheeseburger?"

04:56.672 --> 04:58.966
Okay, what the hell
happened to you?

04:58.966 --> 05:03.929
Robin, I know in the past,
I have been...

05:03.929 --> 05:05.681
emotionally distant.

05:05.681 --> 05:06.849
But Carol has

05:06.849 --> 05:09.726
brought out a whole
new side of me.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.311
I have a new outlook
on life

05:11.395 --> 05:15.524
a devil-may-care insouciance
that embodies the credo,

05:15.524 --> 05:18.527
"No shirt, no shoes,
no problem."

05:18.527 --> 05:20.028
Robin...

05:20.112 --> 05:21.530
I'm fun now.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.115
Oh, God.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.534
- He's fun now?
- That does not sound fun.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.870
No child should have to see
a parent go through that.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.872
Well, it probably took
some of the pressure

05:29.872 --> 05:31.290
off the Barney of it all.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.376
Sir, hi.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.878
My name
is Barney Stinson.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.588
This is Barney?

05:38.672 --> 05:39.715
This man is blond.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.467
Grown men are not blond.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.052
Dad.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.762
Pleased to meet you.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
That's a very...

05:47.848 --> 05:49.725
fun hair color.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.810
That's nothing... When he met me,
his first words were,

05:51.894 --> 05:53.270
- "Nice blouse."
- You were wearing a blouse.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.438
It was not a blouse!

05:54.438 --> 05:55.898
Oh, great.
You're all here.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.232
Let's talk
about our wedding band.

05:57.316 --> 05:58.567
How much do you guys think
they should rock?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.611
'Cause I vote, a million.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.406
Yeah, yeah, I think we
already settled on a DJ, so...

06:04.406 --> 06:06.200
Lily, do you remember
the band you guys

06:06.200 --> 06:07.492
almost hired
for your wedding?

06:07.576 --> 06:08.577
Remember them?

06:08.577 --> 06:10.954
I'll call them up
and book them for you.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.206
Just say the word.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.666
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel
like we keep coming back

06:14.750 --> 06:16.627
to this DJ thing.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.337
- What do you think, baby?
- Yeah, I don't think

06:18.337 --> 06:20.380
anyone should book anything
right now.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.090
Well, why not?

06:22.174 --> 06:25.260
Well, I am going to go the room
marked "Spaghettis,"

06:25.344 --> 06:27.304
which I'm hoping
is the ladies room.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.097
"Meatballs" has
to be men's, right?

06:29.181 --> 06:30.307
I don't know
what the hell

06:30.307 --> 06:32.351
"Calamaris" is.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.150
Um...

06:40.234 --> 06:41.235
Sir, I-I-I...

06:41.235 --> 06:42.653
Permission denied.

06:42.653 --> 06:43.779
Ooh.

06:43.779 --> 06:47.074
And it turns out,
"spaghettis" are men.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.575
I saw a noodle.

06:52.788 --> 06:56.708
- He said no?
- Yeah, I don't know what we're gonna do.

06:56.792 --> 06:58.544
Relax, baby.
I got this.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.087
I know how to be persuasive.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.631
<i>The next day,
Uncle Barney met Robin's dad</i>

07:02.631 --> 07:04.174
<i>for lunch
at the same restaurant.</i>

07:04.258 --> 07:06.426
<i>This time, with a plan.</i>

07:06.510 --> 07:08.011
Hello,
Mr. Scherbatsky.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.430
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.934
You have my attention.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.227
I left the meatball at home

07:15.227 --> 07:17.437
so I could talk to you
spaghetti to spaghetti.

07:17.521 --> 07:18.772
Sir...

07:18.856 --> 07:21.358
I'm very serious
about marrying your daughter.

07:21.358 --> 07:26.822
Barney, when I wanted
to marry Robin's mother,

07:26.822 --> 07:28.949
I slaughtered
a whole family of bears

07:28.949 --> 07:30.325
with my bare hands.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.371
I gave the pelts and the bear meat

07:34.371 --> 07:37.624
to her father as tribute.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.169
You know what we call that
in Canada?

07:40.169 --> 07:41.420
Manners.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.755
Would either
of you like a mudslide?

07:43.839 --> 07:45.465
I just had one.
Thank you.

07:45.549 --> 07:50.179
I'll have a Jazzy Pizzazzy
Razzleberry Rainbow Milkshake

07:50.179 --> 07:52.139
with a swirly straw?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.308
You didn't say the magic word.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.810
I'll go get your drink.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.272
Still crying, huh?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.899
Yeah. We've tried
everything short

08:01.899 --> 08:04.359
of a pack of smokes
and a cup of coffee.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.820
Still nothing but clean dipeys.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.655
There's only one
explanation for this.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.782
Marvin has potty-trained himself.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.951
He sneaks into the bathroom
while we're sleeping.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.578
I'll ask Barney
to check the tapes.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.747
Barney has cameras
in our bathroom?

08:16.747 --> 08:19.082
Well, I mean, don't you think?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.335
Hey, guys.
Robin, good.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.086
You're here. Bad news.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.173
That wedding band you wanted
is booked for May 25.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.592
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?

08:28.592 --> 08:31.345
Oh! Oh, hey! Here's an idea.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.680
Oh, God, Ted,
if you suggest a DJ...

08:33.764 --> 08:36.475
Far from it.
I was going to suggest a band.

08:36.475 --> 08:39.811
A band called...
Kool and the Gang.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.481
Robin,
would you like for me

08:42.481 --> 08:44.691
to get Kool and the Gang
to play at your wedding?

08:44.775 --> 08:47.069
Uh...I...yeah, guess so.

08:47.069 --> 08:49.029
And would it be okay
if they invited their friends,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.323
Beyonce and-and ABBA,

08:51.323 --> 08:52.491
and the Bee Gees,

08:52.491 --> 08:55.035
and Journey,
and Queen?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.161
What? You're...
What are you say...

08:56.245 --> 08:57.621
How... How is that
even possible?

08:57.621 --> 08:58.914
I'll tell you how.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.249
You hire a DJ.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.167
Wicka-wicka-wicka-burn.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.544
Ugh!
God, this is, like,

09:03.544 --> 09:06.338
the fifteenth time my dad
has sent me a friend request.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.840
I'm just gonna hit "accept."

09:07.840 --> 09:10.050
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, don't do it, Robin.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.219
You don't want to see
what's behind that door.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.387
What are you talking about?

09:13.387 --> 09:14.471
He's talking about

09:14.555 --> 09:19.142
my mom's 2,000-word review
of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

09:19.226 --> 09:21.979
And 14 of those words
were "vulva."

09:21.979 --> 09:24.982
You're gonna get endless
requests to play some game

09:24.982 --> 09:27.901
that has something to do
with gangsters and farming.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.153
Never mind the embarrassing
cheerleading photos

09:30.237 --> 09:31.321
from high school.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.782
Begged my mom to burn those. Robin,

09:33.866 --> 09:37.870
trust me, no good can come from
accepting that friend request.

09:37.870 --> 09:41.999
Yeah, I-I think I may have given
you guys the wrong impression.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.668
Okay, my dad is actually
not that bad of a guy.

09:44.668 --> 09:47.379
Do it, Barney.
Squeeze that trigger.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.964
I don't want to do this.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.841
Well, you think I wanted
to kill that bear?

09:50.841 --> 09:52.885
- Yeah, kind of.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.930
I can't do this.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.018
Oh.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.936
What... What the hell is this?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.229
Your dad is crazy!

10:04.313 --> 10:07.232
He wanted me
to kill Fluffernutter!

10:07.316 --> 10:08.817
I told you not
to give him a name!

10:08.901 --> 10:09.902
Well, I did!

10:09.902 --> 10:11.778
I gave him a name
and a backstory!

10:11.862 --> 10:13.822
He comes from a magical
rabbit warren

10:13.906 --> 10:15.741
underneath the old
rusty tractor.

10:15.741 --> 10:17.576
He was the runt of the litter,
but he persevered.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.078
- He...
- Oh, give me this. Give it to me!

10:21.413 --> 10:24.166
Dad, is there, um,
something you want to tell me?

10:25.334 --> 10:28.212
Well, in the early '80s,
I did some wet work for the CIA.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.838
Yes, Daddy,
I remember the bedtime stories.

10:29.922 --> 10:32.841
No, I'm, uh, talking
about your Facebook page?

10:32.925 --> 10:34.593
It says you're married.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.553
Well...

10:36.637 --> 10:39.389
yes, uh, Carol and I were
in Key Largo

10:39.473 --> 10:42.851
at a performance of the
recording artist James Buffett.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.479
We're what are known
as Parrotheads.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.023
And, uh, well, one thing led

10:48.023 --> 10:50.526
to the other, and, uh...

10:51.527 --> 10:52.736
we got married.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.947
You didn't want
to tell me about it?

10:54.947 --> 10:58.450
I Facebooked it...
on Facebook.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.826
Okay, you know what, Dad?

10:59.910 --> 11:02.829
Since you obviously have
no interest in involving me

11:02.913 --> 11:05.249
in your personal life,
I may as well tell you:

11:05.249 --> 11:07.167
Barney and I are already engaged.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.504
That's right.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.173
I'm behind you
on this, Robin.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.467
Directly behind you.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.594
Anyway, this is happening.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.012
And since I wasn't invited
to your wedding,

11:19.096 --> 11:21.557
you're not invited to mine.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.724
Good-bye.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.774
Oh, no!

11:30.858 --> 11:33.527
Fluffernutter peed
all over my pants!

11:39.867 --> 11:41.076
So, I just called up

11:41.076 --> 11:43.620
that wedding band's road manager
to get the number

11:43.704 --> 11:45.956
of the people who booked them
for the 25th,

11:45.956 --> 11:48.417
so I could bribe them into
giving up the band.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.961
You did what?
That is so dishonest!

11:50.961 --> 11:53.088
No matter what happens next,
I think we can all agree,

11:53.172 --> 11:55.090
you're in the wrong here, Lily.

11:55.174 --> 11:56.216
It's your number, Ted.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.552
All right, you got me!

11:58.552 --> 12:01.013
I put a non-refundable
deposit on that band

12:01.013 --> 12:02.931
to keep Barney and Robin
from booking them.

12:03.015 --> 12:04.850
And I would've
gotten away with it

12:04.850 --> 12:07.728
if it wasn't a really stupid
and expensive plan.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.730
Dude, why would you do that?

12:09.730 --> 12:11.190
I don't see
what the big deal is.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.442
The big deal is
Robin deserves better

12:13.442 --> 12:15.736
than some crappy,
unreliable band!

12:15.736 --> 12:18.405
Sure, bands seem cool
with their nice suits

12:18.405 --> 12:19.656
and their well-rehearsed moves,

12:19.740 --> 12:21.909
but let's be honest:
bands let you down.

12:21.909 --> 12:25.204
They-They cheat, they deceive,
and God knows they've slept

12:25.204 --> 12:27.789
with every girl in New York City.
I just, I can't believe

12:27.873 --> 12:30.250
Robin is going through
with marrying...

12:30.334 --> 12:33.128
the idea of getting a band.

12:33.212 --> 12:35.547
And that is, that's a perfectly
normal way to phrase that.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.425
Okay, Ted, bar. Now.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.719
Nice try.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.221
You're gonna stick
me with that baby

12:42.221 --> 12:44.389
so that you guys
can spend five minutes

12:44.473 --> 12:45.807
sorting out his love life,

12:45.891 --> 12:48.060
followed by an hour
of you getting drunk

12:48.060 --> 12:49.937
and pretending to be
in <i>The Departed.</i>

12:49.937 --> 12:52.814
You know what?
I'm sorry, Lily, okay?

12:52.898 --> 12:54.274
But I just need to know:

12:54.358 --> 12:58.278
- Are you a cop?
- I'm not a cop!

12:58.362 --> 12:59.947
Uh-uh.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.114
I got this.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.367
Ted, you, me, upstairs.
Roof. Now.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.826
- What? It's January.
- Move!

13:06.912 --> 13:08.914
Let's cut the crap.
We're both freezing,

13:08.914 --> 13:10.749
just say it
and we can go downstairs.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.584
- Say what?
- Say how much you hate

13:12.668 --> 13:15.045
that Robin and Barney
are getting married.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.840
What? No. I... I'm happy for them.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.093
I-I encouraged Robin
to go after Barney.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.637
I know, because you thought
you were okay letting her go.

13:23.637 --> 13:27.516
But now that she's really gone,
it hurts.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.560
<i>Kids, at that point in my life,</i>

13:29.560 --> 13:32.020
<i>I'd been hurt
quite a few times already.</i>

13:32.104 --> 13:35.065
Today, we're gonna braid
friendship bracelets.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.197
<i>I fell in love...</i>

13:42.281 --> 13:45.367
There is a very simple explana...

13:45.367 --> 13:46.910
This one time,
I was playing tennis, and...

13:49.663 --> 13:52.207
- Ooh! Oh, ow!
- Ow!

13:54.877 --> 13:56.503
Hey, Schmosby,
remember when you dookied

13:56.587 --> 13:58.172
in your pants
down by the lake?

13:58.172 --> 14:00.007
Unbelievable!

14:07.848 --> 14:10.726
Do you love me?

14:10.726 --> 14:13.896
No.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.939
<i>But when I saw
that text message,</i>

14:16.023 --> 14:19.276
<i>and found out Robin
was engaged, it was like:</i>

14:22.905 --> 14:24.907
Unbelievable!

14:24.907 --> 14:26.074
No.

14:26.158 --> 14:29.536
<i>...times a million.</i>

14:29.620 --> 14:30.913
I am happy for them.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.081
Is all you'll let yourself
say out loud,

14:33.165 --> 14:35.792
because if you said anything
to the contrary, well,

14:35.876 --> 14:39.630
that would make you
the most awful person on this rooftop.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.924
So, I'm gonna give you an out.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.842
And how are you gonna do that?

14:43.926 --> 14:47.387
By saying something
that is even more awful.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.555
Like what?

14:49.723 --> 14:53.018
Sometimes I wish
I wasn't a mom.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.603
Sometimes I want to pack a bag

14:54.603 --> 14:57.689
and leave in the middle
of the night and not come back.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.364
Robin shouldn't be with Barney,
she should be with me.

15:14.039 --> 15:16.959
- You serious?
- I don't know.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.920
I mean, I love
being a mom, and...

15:19.920 --> 15:22.881
I love Marvin so much.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.049
But...

15:24.049 --> 15:27.052
but do you remember
when I wanted to be an artist?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.637
Art was my whole life.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.222
And-and now it's been months

15:30.222 --> 15:32.683
since I've even
picked up a brush.

15:32.683 --> 15:35.853
I-I spend the whole day
taking care of kids at my job,

15:35.853 --> 15:37.980
and I come home
and it's more of the same.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.606
It just...

15:39.690 --> 15:42.359
It never lets up, it...

15:42.359 --> 15:45.279
It's just really,
really hard, Ted.

15:48.073 --> 15:51.034
Have you talked to Marshall
about how you feel?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.412
Have you talked to Robin
about how you feel?

15:53.412 --> 15:56.415
Fair enough.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.543
I just think we have to accept
our lots in life,

15:59.543 --> 16:02.671
and I have to be a mom to a...

16:02.671 --> 16:04.548
a beautiful, wonderful,

16:04.548 --> 16:08.135
if slightly constipated
little boy, and...

16:08.135 --> 16:12.222
you have to let
Robin and Barney get a band.

16:14.892 --> 16:18.353
All right, let's see
what's in this dipey.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.814
Nothing.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.443
Absolutely nothing.

16:24.443 --> 16:25.611
Hey.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.655
Are you finally
giving Daddy a smile?

16:28.739 --> 16:30.616
Oh!

16:30.616 --> 16:31.783
Oh, God!

16:31.867 --> 16:33.952
<i>And, no, it wasn't confetti.</i>

16:34.036 --> 16:36.038
Oh!

16:36.038 --> 16:38.790
Oh, God!

16:38.874 --> 16:42.336
Please!

16:42.336 --> 16:46.256
Holy confetti.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.259
<i>That night, Robin agreed
to meet her dad one more time.</i>

16:49.343 --> 16:52.721
Your Dad has something to say.

16:56.058 --> 17:00.312
I'm sorry for getting married
without consulting you.

17:00.312 --> 17:03.273
- It was wrong of me.
- There. Now, Robin...

17:03.357 --> 17:07.444
I know that no mere apology
will fix this.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.488
And that is why

17:09.488 --> 17:11.865
I've asked Carol for a divorce.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.033
What?

17:13.033 --> 17:15.160
She's heartbroken, understandably.

17:15.244 --> 17:16.620
Possibly suicidal.

17:16.620 --> 17:19.206
- I did not tell him...
- But if that's the price

17:19.206 --> 17:21.375
for my daughter's love...

17:21.375 --> 17:24.419
then I will gladly
let Carol pay it.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.466
Was that not what you wanted?

17:29.550 --> 17:31.051
You want to know what I want?

17:31.051 --> 17:35.097
A normal dad. That's all.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.598
I want you to give
this blond guy

17:36.682 --> 17:38.267
permission to marry me.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.477
Come to the wedding,
give me away,

17:40.561 --> 17:43.188
smile in the pictures,
and then...

17:43.272 --> 17:46.692
dance with me like a normal dad.

17:46.692 --> 17:48.360
Is that too much to ask?

17:48.360 --> 17:51.905
"Of course not.
Oh, Robin, my darling girl,

17:51.989 --> 17:55.492
of course I'll do all stuff.
I love you and I'm proud of you."

17:56.785 --> 17:58.745
- He didn't say that?
- No.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.123
Fine. One dance.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.834
"Cheeseburger in Paradise."

18:03.834 --> 18:06.670
And Carol's going to sing it.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.631
Well, see you at the wedding.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.216
But it's kind of amazing.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.386
I mean, he's never apologized
to me in his life.

18:14.386 --> 18:17.598
Barney made it happen.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.224
He must really love me.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.894
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.689
I'm really happy for you guys.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.193
But I still think
you should get a DJ.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.611
- Ju-Ju..
- For God's sakes, Ted.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.904
Hear me out.

18:31.904 --> 18:33.780
<i>I made a pretty strong case
that night,</i>

18:33.864 --> 18:36.116
<i>but in the end,
she didn't want a DJ.</i>

18:36.200 --> 18:37.701
<i>She wanted a band.</i>

18:37.701 --> 18:39.536
<i>And guess what happened.</i>

18:39.620 --> 18:42.289
That's right, the band cancelled
at the last minute,

18:42.289 --> 18:43.582
just like I said they would.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.251
The wedding is in a week,
and no bands.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.795
When will people realize
I always know what's what?

18:48.879 --> 18:51.173
He says to the lesbian
he dated for a month.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.342
That's a fair point.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.177
Anyway, you guys
wouldn't, uh, happen to know

18:55.177 --> 18:56.929
of any good wedding bands

18:56.929 --> 18:59.640
available at the last minute,
would you?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.850
Ted, do you believe
in destiny?

19:01.934 --> 19:03.644
You really don't know me,
do you?

19:03.644 --> 19:05.896
We just had brunch
with my ex-roommate.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.607
- The bass player?
- No, she's not just a bass player.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.610
She's a bass player in the best
wedding band in the tri-state area.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.070
They had a gig lined up
for this weekend,

19:13.070 --> 19:15.656
but it just fell through
this morning.

19:15.656 --> 19:18.784
You, my friend,
are gonna save that wedding.

19:18.784 --> 19:19.952
Do you know any DJs?

19:19.952 --> 19:21.453
Dude, come on.

19:21.537 --> 19:24.206
Let it go, bro. Just let it go.
All right, all right. All right.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.041
Well, I guess, uh...

19:26.041 --> 19:27.918
Guess it's a lucky thing
I ran into you guys.
