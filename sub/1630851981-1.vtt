00:45.083 --> 00:47.041
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:02.041 --> 01:05.375
And our kitchen connects to
a little dining room right over there.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.583
Now you mentioned you wanted
an open concept.

01:07.666 --> 01:10.750
- Cool, I am obsessed with open concept.
- Yes.

01:10.833 --> 01:12.750
Open is my favorite concept.

01:12.833 --> 01:15.791
Well, here they are,
Pam and Jeff McKenzie, the owners.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.875
I was just telling the Breckins
that they could probably knock down

01:18.958 --> 01:22.250
some of these walls
and make it one, big, open space.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.291
- Not mad at that.
- Yes.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.125
Well, you just wanna be careful,

01:26.208 --> 01:29.000
'cause if those are load-baring walls
and you knock one down,

01:29.083 --> 01:30.541
the whole place could collapse.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.833
- Mmm. Bummer.
- Really?

01:31.916 --> 01:34.916
Um, it's not a Jenga tower, Jeff.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.375
It's not a Jenga tower, Jeff.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.500
And Pam is a teacher
at Winnetka Elementary.

01:42.583 --> 01:45.208
Am I right? Yes.
The schools here are amazing.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.375
Correct, Jeff?

01:47.458 --> 01:52.708
Um, yeah. Some of the best in the state.
They are totally lit.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.416
- Aw.
- Oh.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.458
Especially since they put in
new metal detectors.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.583
- Oh.
- Okay.

01:59.666 --> 02:01.666
Jeff. What are you doing?

02:01.750 --> 02:03.125
Uh, Jeff, uh,

02:03.208 --> 02:05.958
could you go get some more
bottled water to everyone.

02:06.041 --> 02:07.250
Yep.

02:10.125 --> 02:11.791
Can you get some more bottled water?

02:11.875 --> 02:13.583
Ooh. Mm-hmm. Yep.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.291
Jeff.

02:16.375 --> 02:20.458
- Mum, I really have to pee.
- I cannot believe you need to go again.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.041
I told you to use the restroom
in the coffee shop.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.958
After Uncle Stu had been in there? Really?

02:26.041 --> 02:28.625
Did you see how many deviled eggs
he had for lunch?

02:28.708 --> 02:30.416
Oh, goodness. Um.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.416
You'll just have to wait till we get home.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.666
You sure about that? Do the maths.

02:34.750 --> 02:39.583
Six soda refills into one, tiny,
ten-year-old's bladder does not go.

02:39.666 --> 02:41.166
I'm...

02:46.416 --> 02:49.250
- Okay. I've got an idea.
- What?

02:49.333 --> 02:51.250
You're gonna have to pretend with Mummy.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.958
We're gonna have to pretend
we're going to buy a house.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.750
Ooh! Can I get one of those?

03:03.833 --> 03:05.958
Uh, that might be a question
for your parents,

03:06.041 --> 03:08.041
just 'cause there's a lot of sugar
in them, so…

03:08.125 --> 03:09.125
Oh. Fine.

03:09.875 --> 03:13.333
Wow, you're so tall.
You almost look like Frankenstein.

03:13.916 --> 03:18.041
Oh, you mean Frankenstein's monster.
Frankenstein is the doctor, FYI.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.750
Uh. Cool dolls.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.458
Well, they're not mine.

03:25.541 --> 03:27.333
Um. They belonged to my mother.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.500
Sure they did.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.875
Oh! What's wrong with this one?

03:33.666 --> 03:34.916
Yeah, I don't know.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.666
But they're very delicate, so why don't
we just leave them right there.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.416
Oh. Little boy doesn't wanna share
his dolly?

03:43.375 --> 03:44.291
Excuse me?

03:44.375 --> 03:46.833
Ah, I get it. You're one of those guys.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.833
- What do you mean?
- I don't know. You tell me.

03:50.541 --> 03:52.416
- There you are.
- Oh! Hi, Mom.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.541
Doesn't he look like Frankenstein to you?

03:55.250 --> 03:58.083
I... Max. I am so sorry.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.541
No, he doesn't look like Frankenstein.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.666
He looks like Frankenstein's monster.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.583
I'm sorry. Has he been bothering you?

04:04.666 --> 04:06.458
No. He's a delight.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.791
Aw, well, he has his moments.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.125
Ooh! Is that a Schneider Kinder?

04:11.208 --> 04:14.708
I saw these on Treasure Trunk,
that antiques show. I love that show.

04:15.833 --> 04:20.500
There was this elderly lady who'd bought
one at a garage sale for about $10.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.125
And then it ended up
going for about $5,000.

04:23.208 --> 04:27.000
Wow, 5,000 bucks
for an ugly, little porcelain kid.

04:27.541 --> 04:30.125
I didn't get half that
for selling my real kids.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.333
Yeah?

04:34.416 --> 04:36.458
- I think we should go home.
- Oh, yay.

04:36.541 --> 04:41.375
I can't wait to go home and share
one toilet with nine bloomin' cousins.

04:41.458 --> 04:44.541
Maxwell Johan Mercer.
What is with you today, hmm?

04:44.625 --> 04:46.833
Carol Ellen Mercer, take a guess?

04:46.916 --> 04:50.750
You know what? How's about we just spend
Christmas in Tokyo without you?

04:50.833 --> 04:53.208
- Great idea.
- I'll leave Grammy with you.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.750
- Oh, yes, Grammy.
- Then you'll have to go to bed

04:55.833 --> 04:58.125
at 6:00 p.m. every evening
and help her with her bath.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.708
Oh, that sounds great. Where do I sign up?

05:01.791 --> 05:03.833
No McDonald's for you on the way home.

05:03.916 --> 05:05.291
What? Mum.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.333
You can't promise
a kid McDonald's and not deliver.

05:08.416 --> 05:09.833
Ooh.

05:09.916 --> 05:11.416
What a McShame.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.916
Ooh. That's good.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.875
Darling, home. Car. Now. Come on.

05:40.666 --> 05:43.500
I'm sorry I lashed out at you,
but I just don't see why

05:43.583 --> 05:46.666
we have to share our house
with every stupid relative we have.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.458
I mean, it's Christmas.

05:48.541 --> 05:51.791
Exactly, and Christmas
is all about spending time with family.

05:52.833 --> 05:56.375
Even if everything they do
makes you anxious or furious and insane.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.708
Because that is the meaning of Christmas.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.750
All right, McKenzies.
We have chummed the...

06:10.250 --> 06:13.875
Chummed the waters. And I think
we've gotten a couple of nibbles.

06:13.958 --> 06:16.333
Now I know you guys wanna sell
as soon as possible,

06:16.416 --> 06:18.666
but I don't think
we're gonna get any major bites

06:18.750 --> 06:20.250
until after the holiday season.

06:21.166 --> 06:22.166
I don't know.

06:22.250 --> 06:26.375
The guy Jeff saw looking through my
underwear drawer seemed interested, no?

06:27.125 --> 06:30.666
Yes, but I don't think
in buying the house. But don't worry.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.916
The Breckins are circling the boat,
so I'll stay on top of them.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.500
The kids are home.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.708
What's happening?
Why are we scared of the kids?

06:40.791 --> 06:42.625
We haven't told them
we're selling the house.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.375
Hey!

06:47.958 --> 06:48.958
Oh, hi.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.333
Hi, guys. I thought you were gonna call
after the movie was over.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.541
Oh, no, we just took an Uber.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.375
- You good?
- Oh, yeah.

06:59.916 --> 07:01.833
Yeah, I'm doing some thinking, you know?

07:01.916 --> 07:04.333
This is a very good spot for thinking.

07:05.916 --> 07:06.916
Hmm.

07:07.833 --> 07:09.833
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.708
- I love this space.
- Oh.

07:13.208 --> 07:14.333
Who are you?

07:15.333 --> 07:19.083
- I'm, uh...
- This is Gavin. And he is, um...

07:19.166 --> 07:20.750
Your personal trainer. That... Yes.

07:20.833 --> 07:24.625
- I'm gonna be training your flabby dad.
- Hmm?

07:25.208 --> 07:26.041
Balloons?

07:26.125 --> 07:29.583
These are a gesture to say congratulations
for taking your first step.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.958
Congratulations, man.
You got to take care of yourself.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.500
We're gonna get rid of
that jelly belly, Dad. Am I right?

07:34.583 --> 07:36.250
Get rid of the jelly belly.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.916
We're gonna put some muscle
on that flat, pancake butt.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.708
- Thank you, Gavin.
- Yeah.

07:40.791 --> 07:43.875
I'm just gonna take off real quick,
and I'm gonna see y'all later.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.291
And I'm looking forward to that butt.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.875
- Can I have a go? Can I have a go?
- You do it!

07:56.958 --> 07:58.541
- Please?
- No, you!

07:59.416 --> 08:01.541
- Please, just one quick go.
- Ow!

08:02.208 --> 08:05.541
- Max, clean up all this crap right now.
- Sorry, Dad.

08:05.625 --> 08:06.875
I just stepped on a Lego.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.166
It's the most painful thing in the world.

08:09.666 --> 08:12.000
I'm winning over here.

08:14.250 --> 08:18.083
I understand that our flight
was canceled and rebooked.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.583
No, my problem is that you have split
our family onto two separate flights.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.833
I'm sorry, can you speak up, please?
It's very loud in here.

08:25.916 --> 08:28.583
You can never catch me. Jerk!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.957
Don't touch me, perv. I'm your sister.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.666
Homebot, what year is it in Japan?

08:40.582 --> 08:43.582
Guys, seriously, who keeps
swapping the Homebot to German?

08:43.666 --> 08:45.500
- Hey!
- Homebot, nein! Nein!

08:45.583 --> 08:46.583
Ha ha!

08:46.666 --> 08:49.041
Guys, Homebot is not a toy...

08:49.125 --> 08:52.208
No, no, stop! Stop it!
Homebot is not a toy!

08:52.291 --> 08:54.041
I'm sick of this bullsh...

08:56.958 --> 09:00.791
We don't have to tell Santa
about that, right, Goobie?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.833
You need to project when you speak.

09:04.416 --> 09:07.333
- Sir, I am not taking a tone with you.
- Mum.

09:07.416 --> 09:11.541
I'm simply saying that you have put me
on a different flight to my children.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.416
- Mum.
- The computer won't let you?

09:13.500 --> 09:15.916
- What is the computer? Is it God?
- Guys, guys...

09:16.000 --> 09:18.666
- Mum. Mum!
- Guess what? Spanking's on the menu!

09:18.750 --> 09:22.458
Max, please! You are not
the only person in this house, darling.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.833
I wish I was.

09:24.916 --> 09:27.875
Boys, don't make me run.
I have tendinitis.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.250
Move, Max.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.958
- Lay down your arms!
- Americans, please!

09:34.250 --> 09:35.875
Pizza! Lovely.

09:35.958 --> 09:38.267
- How many do you have?
- Three pepperonis and three pineapples.

09:38.291 --> 09:40.017
- Let's just get...
- Everybody loves pineapple.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.250
I've still gotta do some packing
and some laundry.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.125
Everybody, pizza!

09:44.208 --> 09:48.833
Can you come and eat, please?
Seriously. We're gonna be up at 5:00 a.m.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.500
Stop, please!

09:56.916 --> 09:59.958
Stop. You'll break your neck.
And look at your suitcases.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.791
We expect major, major delays
at the airport.

10:20.875 --> 10:23.250
We don't know when O'Hare is
gonna be able to get back…

10:23.333 --> 10:25.541
What was that today? Metal detectors?

10:25.625 --> 10:29.916
What? They have them.
I'm sorry. Is that not "lit"?

10:30.000 --> 10:33.875
Okay, we are trying to
sell the house, Jeff.

10:33.958 --> 10:36.166
You're the one who said
it's our only option,

10:36.250 --> 10:38.083
so I need you on my team, okay?

10:38.916 --> 10:41.208
I know. I know. I just...

10:41.291 --> 10:45.583
Today, it felt real, and I didn't like it.

10:45.666 --> 10:47.125
You think I do?

10:47.208 --> 10:50.083
I always thought we'd get old and weird
in this house.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.476
We've done the math.
We can't afford it on my salary alone.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.291
Yeah, but I crushed my interview with IBM.

10:55.375 --> 10:58.000
You crushed it. Crushed it!

10:58.750 --> 11:00.458
But that was three months ago.

11:00.541 --> 11:04.875
Any company with a brain needs
a good data migration manager, okay?

11:04.958 --> 11:07.708
I wouldn't trust an algorithm
to port over a MySQL database

11:07.791 --> 11:10.125
to a new server
without any human oversight.

11:11.875 --> 11:13.625
Me neither.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.291
But it might take a while
to find another job.

11:17.375 --> 11:20.583
You said it yourself.
The data migration boom is over.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.041
It's the cloud.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.541
The cloud.

11:26.958 --> 11:30.250
So I need you to get on board, okay?

11:31.166 --> 11:34.166
Come on. It's our last Christmas here.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.250
Let's try to enjoy it.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.500
Tons of fun.

12:03.666 --> 12:04.666
Hunter?

12:04.750 --> 12:08.916
Hey, Pama-lama-ding-dong!
Guess what? We're outside!

12:11.375 --> 12:13.000
- Get up.
- Queen Latifah.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.041
Get up. Your brother's here.

12:16.625 --> 12:17.625
God.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.416
Damn it.

12:33.541 --> 12:34.958
Gosh, I miss the snow!

12:35.916 --> 12:38.791
- Hey. What are you doing...
- Doing here?

12:38.875 --> 12:41.750
We flew in early to get ahead of
snowpocalypse or whatever.

12:41.833 --> 12:43.416
Snowmageddon.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.333
Snowpocalypse is better.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.583
Hey, babe. Hurry up.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.250
- Coming, baby!
- Who's that? Aah.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.333
Pamuel L. Jackson! Bring it in.

12:52.416 --> 12:53.916
Hi, Hunter. Hi.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.583
Here she is!

12:57.291 --> 12:59.166
Oh. Careful.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.291
- Okay! Hey.
- Oh!

13:11.375 --> 13:14.375
Oh, we would've called, but we thought
it would be fun to surprise you.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.541
- Yeah.
- Are you surprised?

13:15.625 --> 13:18.041
We are surprised. We're very surprised.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.583
I know. It's so cute here.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.666
- Aunt Mei!
- So quaint... Hi!

13:21.750 --> 13:22.750
Hi, my adorables.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.517
I didn't think you were coming
till tomorrow.

13:24.541 --> 13:25.541
I'm here now.

13:25.625 --> 13:29.250
We all thought she was coming tomorrow,
but she's come in the dead of night.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.750
Hey, Ollie, look who it is.

13:31.833 --> 13:35.250
- It's Uncle Jeff. Hey.
- Hey, buddy!

13:35.333 --> 13:37.041
Ollie, look! Snow!

13:37.958 --> 13:39.166
Good to see you, buddy.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.791
He has gotten so big.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.166
Okay!

13:42.250 --> 13:44.458
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

13:44.541 --> 13:47.375
It's the last one.
It's the last one. I promise, okay?

13:48.041 --> 13:49.250
That's enough.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.083
Mind giving our luggage a tuggage?
I wanna get that guy situated.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.458
Wow.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.875
Yeah, we had a great year.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.041
Oh, great arm, buddy!

14:04.125 --> 14:06.666
- Ollie, that is not a toy.
- I'll get it.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.958
We're teaching him Spanish!

14:11.041 --> 14:13.416
What did I tell you about taking
other people's stuff?

14:13.500 --> 14:16.833
- Where do you have us set up?
- Oh, in the den on the pullout.

14:16.916 --> 14:20.708
Okay.
In the den on the pullout. Yeah, okay.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.833
Wow, that lady wasn't kidding.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.166
What?

15:02.166 --> 15:04.958
What... Where is it?

15:10.416 --> 15:14.583
That brat kid stole my doll.
My mom's doll.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.583
How am I gonna find this kid?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.208
Maxwell Johan Mercer.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.750
Carol Ellen Mercer.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.125
Bingo.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.375
You have arrived at your destination.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.625
Get in the car!

15:44.250 --> 15:47.791
You need to get in a car now.
We are so late. You have no idea.

15:47.875 --> 15:50.000
- Gotcha!
- What was that for?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.559
- I legit might cry right now.
- Don't!

15:51.583 --> 15:53.291
I need that for cheerleading, you cretin.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.875
Son of a sandwich!

15:54.958 --> 15:58.208
Get in the car!

15:58.291 --> 16:00.583
We're gonna miss the flight,
you guys. Come on!

16:00.666 --> 16:02.958
Uh, hi, my dude. Um...

16:03.041 --> 16:04.625
Is Carol Mercer home?

16:04.708 --> 16:06.767
No, Carol took the early flight.
She booked the cars.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.226
That's why they're in her name.
These are our cars. We need to go.

16:09.250 --> 16:10.833
Will you be a mensch?

16:10.916 --> 16:12.625
- Put that in the back for us, huh?
- Uh…

16:12.708 --> 16:15.458
Bethany, is this a good time
for a selfie in front of an Uber?

16:15.541 --> 16:17.750
#ill-judged.

16:19.250 --> 16:21.208
Text that to me.
Okay, guys, get in the car!

16:21.291 --> 16:22.666
Give your stuff to the driver.

16:22.750 --> 16:25.083
- If I miss the duty-free shop…
- I'm not the driver.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.291
…I am going to shave somebody's head.
That's real.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.625
Blake, you do realize
they sell alcohol in Japan?

16:29.708 --> 16:31.208
Hey, big news, Stu.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.541
Duty-free shops sell
three-foot Toblerones.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.559
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna give that to you
and ask you to take real good care of it.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.500
It's got my sleep apnea machine in there.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.625
Do you know if Carol's son, Max, is home?

16:42.333 --> 16:45.333
If you don't see him,
he's halfway to Tokyo by now. All right.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.833
Is that everyone?
The cars are leaving now.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.750
Everybody, say cheese.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.875
Everybody, wave.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.083
Somebody that lives here, what's the code?

17:14.165 --> 17:15.958
- Your mamma!
- Thank you, Ricky!

17:16.040 --> 17:18.250
Guess who's number one
to get his head shaved?

17:19.083 --> 17:20.208
It's Ricky! Code!

17:20.290 --> 17:23.415
- One, one, one, two.
- One, one, one, two. Brilliant.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.708
That's a bad code.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.375
Armed.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.250
Here we go. All right.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.458
I'm sorry,
but I really do need to talk to Carol.

17:38.541 --> 17:42.541
Yes. Don't worry. I'll make sure that
Carol gives you five stars in the app.

17:42.625 --> 17:43.958
Reputation is everything.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.541
Oh, hey, wait! Wait!

17:55.708 --> 17:57.583
What the heck are you looking at?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.791
I'm sorry. I'm having a bad day.

18:15.583 --> 18:16.625
There it is.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.125
Oh, my…

18:24.875 --> 18:26.750
One, one, one, two.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.875
Okay, it's just a dog.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.375
I'm being ridiculous. I've gone insane.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.958
I'm a good, normal man.
I'm gonna talk to Pam.

19:04.666 --> 19:05.666
Pam.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.375
I'm just a neighbor helping.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.625
I water their dogs... plants.

19:09.708 --> 19:13.291
I'm a friend of Carol's. A friend of...
Carol Ellen Mercer is her name.

19:13.375 --> 19:14.375
I gotta call Pam.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.625
Where is he?

19:23.708 --> 19:25.083
I'm not sure where he is.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.375
Oh, great.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.708
I'm sorry. Sorry.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.708
Oh.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.041
- Here we go. Sorry. Hi.
- Is everything okay?

19:41.125 --> 19:43.291
- Yeah, fine. Thank you.
- What are you wearing?

19:43.375 --> 19:45.434
- I didn't have time to change.
- You look ridiculous.

19:45.458 --> 19:48.041
- Thank you.
- Season's greetings, seniors.

19:48.125 --> 19:50.958
I apologize for the delay,
but we all saw the reason why.

19:51.041 --> 19:54.750
My D-flat has decided
that the world runs on his time.

19:55.625 --> 19:59.041
Without further ado,
I give you the Ne'er-Do-Bells.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.750
Hands on bells.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.083
Raise the bells.

20:04.916 --> 20:06.625
Two, three, four.

20:11.125 --> 20:12.750
- So did you get my voice mail?
- Yes.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.875
All of this happened
in the last two hours?

20:14.958 --> 20:17.416
Yeah, the doll is in that house.
I saw it in his jacket.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.976
- Why didn't you tell me this?
- I thought I would handle it myself.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.375
And your way of handling it
was breaking and entering?

20:22.458 --> 20:23.750
Just entering. I had the key.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.458
- It's still against the law, Jeff.
- Like a lightbulb.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.291
Oh, my gosh. This is so terrible.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.041
But that's why I didn't do it, Columbo.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.208
Well, good.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.208
- Like Pinocchio.
- Pinocchio.

20:35.291 --> 20:36.976
What are we gonna do now?
We need that doll.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.041
I know we do, okay? Just let me think.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.041
- Uh, like Monopoly!
- Yeah.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.500
- That's too late.
- Yeah.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.541
Boo. Sounds like garbage.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.666
- Herman, no. None of that.
- Well, it does.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.750
You stink.

20:53.541 --> 20:54.791
Here's what we're gonna do.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.208
We will wait until they
come back from vacation,

20:57.291 --> 21:00.458
and then I will go over there.
I will tell the mom everything,

21:00.541 --> 21:02.041
and we'll get the doll back.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.875
Get it together.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.583
Are you sure we should wait?

21:05.666 --> 21:08.958
Yes, Jeff. I don't want my husband
spending Christmas in jail.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.125
- Yippee!
- Hey!

21:10.208 --> 21:11.708
Wow.

21:11.791 --> 21:14.166
But the...
Our future is in that house, Pam.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.541
Come on. What could happen to it
in an empty house?

21:21.833 --> 21:22.916
It's okay, Martha.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.375
Don't blame her. That's you.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.583
Sorry.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.916
Shame on you. This is my life choice.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.583
Hello?

21:46.791 --> 21:47.875
Mum?

21:50.250 --> 21:51.333
Dad?

21:53.666 --> 21:54.791
Uncle Blake?

21:56.125 --> 21:57.458
Uncle Stu?

22:09.916 --> 22:12.000
It's a Christmas miracle.

22:18.291 --> 22:21.500
Oh, come on, mate!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Ugh.

22:38.708 --> 22:39.791
Oh!

22:40.583 --> 22:44.375
All right, Internet. Show me your worst.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.875
Well played, Mum and Dad.

23:41.541 --> 23:45.125
Pam, that doll is worth $238,000,

23:45.208 --> 23:49.041
and is it really a crime to steal
something that was stolen from you?

23:49.125 --> 23:52.916
Yes, that's what O.J. got in trouble for.
The second time.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.750
- Okay, I just think...
- Look, I know that you wanna save the day

23:55.833 --> 23:58.041
because you feel bad
about losing your job.

23:58.125 --> 23:59.625
What's wrong with that?

23:59.708 --> 24:02.625
The fact that you will feel a lot worse
telling your kids you're…

24:03.625 --> 24:05.625
in jail for committing a felony.

24:05.708 --> 24:08.375
No, it's a misdemeanor.
Yeah, I looked it up.

24:08.458 --> 24:11.208
That is evidence. Do you know
how to clear your search history?

24:11.291 --> 24:13.583
Yeah. I mean, well, I probably...

24:13.666 --> 24:15.559
- I-I'm sure I could figure it out.
- Okay, listen.

24:15.583 --> 24:18.458
We made a plan.
Let's just stick to it, okay?

24:18.541 --> 24:20.166
- Mom, Dad, look at us.
- Hey!

24:20.250 --> 24:22.041
- Hey!
- You like 'em? Look at Ollie.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.166
He's a little elf.

24:23.250 --> 24:26.000
He's so smart. We handed 'em to him.
He put 'em right on.

24:26.083 --> 24:27.250
Oh, amazing.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.375
Um, could I get some,
uh, reindeer antlers for Pam

24:30.958 --> 24:33.541
and a pair of the little elf glasses
for my brother?

24:37.708 --> 24:39.851
- Ollie, we need big smiles from you, okay?
- Look at Mommy.

24:39.875 --> 24:41.833
Big smiles, Ollie. Big smiles.

24:41.916 --> 24:44.041
Little guy comes alive
in front of the camera.

24:45.291 --> 24:48.041
Um, okay, cute photo much?

24:48.125 --> 24:50.208
I mean, come on. Look at that.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.875
Look at what's happened there.
It's an adorable image.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.333
It's cute. It's super cute.

24:55.416 --> 24:56.916
It's a special memory.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.375
And since we are paper-free
at the North Pole,

24:59.458 --> 25:00.833
you can actually use this code

25:00.916 --> 25:03.375
to download that special memory
right from the cloud.

25:03.458 --> 25:07.666
Wh... So, you're not even using
solid-state storage on-site?

25:07.750 --> 25:10.833
- I don't know what that means.
- I'll tell you what it means.

25:10.916 --> 25:13.726
What it means is, you're entirely
at the whim of a hosted service provider

25:13.750 --> 25:15.250
for virtualization and backup.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.708
Sir, I'm not a woman in tech.

25:16.791 --> 25:19.142
- I'm a woman in memories.
- You know, it's not a video game.

25:19.166 --> 25:20.517
- She doesn't care.
- I don't understand

25:20.541 --> 25:22.833
why you'd be so cavalier
with something this important.

25:22.916 --> 25:23.958
What is this?

25:25.041 --> 25:28.125
New fashion, honey. We gotta...
We gotta switch up these colors.

25:28.208 --> 25:32.000
- Mom, look at how cute this is.
- So cute.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.291
- Can I get it?
- Oh.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.500
Oh, honey, no.
I'm sorry, that's way too much.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.833
Okay, no, no, no. I can't stand
the thought of you not having that.

25:40.916 --> 25:43.875
Consider it an early Christmas present
from Auntie Mei-Mei.

25:43.958 --> 25:45.458
You're gonna look so hot. Come on.

25:45.541 --> 25:47.875
- Mei.
- Are you kidding?

25:49.458 --> 25:50.666
This, please.

25:53.458 --> 25:54.625
A top for you.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.916
I'll tell you what
I am gonna give you, Snakes.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.583
I'm gonna give you 'til the count of ten

26:07.375 --> 26:11.666
to get your ugly, yellow, no-good keister…

26:11.750 --> 26:13.916
- Ugh, this is garbage.
- …off my spaceship…

26:14.000 --> 26:16.875
I don't know why they're always
trying to remake the classics.

26:16.958 --> 26:18.625
Never as good as the originals.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.166
You want some more P-corn, C-Train?

26:20.250 --> 26:21.850
- Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
- All right.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.041
- One, two…
- I don't remember this guy.

26:27.083 --> 26:28.916
Whoa! Ho, ho!

26:29.000 --> 26:32.041
Nearly lost your house there,
Pama-lama-ding-dong.

26:51.791 --> 26:53.083
Hey, honey.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.333
- Put the topper on.
- Should we put it on together?

26:55.416 --> 26:57.875
- Yeah.
- One, two, three.

26:57.958 --> 26:59.708
Santa came! Santa came!

26:59.791 --> 27:02.416
Santa came! Santa came! Santa came!

27:02.500 --> 27:03.875
I'm so excited.

27:03.958 --> 27:05.750
Santa came!

27:05.833 --> 27:07.166
- Oh, my God!
- Santa came.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.583
- Come here.
- Oh, my God!

27:12.666 --> 27:14.250
Home sweet home.

27:16.375 --> 27:18.375
Mom, you gotta save our house.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.375
Seriously, Mom,
will you just get the doll?

27:20.458 --> 27:22.500
It's just entering, Pam. We have the key.

27:22.583 --> 27:24.416
Pam, you have to call me.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.000
- Hi, Gavin… - Come and get me.

27:26.083 --> 27:28.291
Now, Fräulein. Now!

27:29.750 --> 27:32.041
I will, you ugly, little boy!

27:32.125 --> 27:35.083
Keep the change, ya filthy earthling.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.250
Well, I think you're very handsome.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.041
Let's go.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.833
- Where are we going?
- To get some milk.

27:42.916 --> 27:45.083
Oh, well, there's plenty of milk
in the fridge, Pammy.

27:45.166 --> 27:48.291
No, you guys have a ton of milk.
You're all set on milk.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.666
Uh, eggnog. We need...
We're gonna get some eggnog.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.375
- You've seen the weather, right?
- It's snowmageddon out there.

27:53.458 --> 27:55.500
Yeah, snowpocalypse, babe.
Snowpocalypse is better.

27:55.583 --> 28:00.000
- Are you gonna be okay to drive?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

28:01.166 --> 28:03.166
Yes. We are okay to drive.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.250
Honey, your instincts were right.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.791
We can't leave a winning lottery ticket
in some stranger's house.

28:11.875 --> 28:15.125
Yeah, yeah. We are doing this.

28:15.208 --> 28:17.166
Oh, honey, that's Beechtree.

28:23.166 --> 28:26.916
Honey, steer into the slide.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.583
N-No, y-you steer into a skid.

28:37.208 --> 28:40.875
Pam, I watched an episode
of Locked Up earlier today on demand,

28:40.958 --> 28:41.958
and…

28:42.833 --> 28:44.625
I can't go to jail, honey.

28:44.708 --> 28:47.250
I wouldn't last 30 seconds in gen pop.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.250
Gen pop?

28:49.833 --> 28:51.041
General population.

28:51.625 --> 28:53.416
It's where fresh fish get got.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.375
Jeff.

28:58.916 --> 29:01.000
I need you to focus.

29:01.083 --> 29:04.666
Nobody here is getting got.

29:04.750 --> 29:09.333
The only thing getting got is that doll.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.833
So let's go get it!

29:17.083 --> 29:18.625
- Can you unlock the door?
- Yeah.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.208
Sorry.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.166
Don't move.

29:34.416 --> 29:35.708
Why are we standing still?

29:35.791 --> 29:39.875
Because the light is motion-activated,
and if we stand still, it'll turn off.

29:39.958 --> 29:43.625
Yeah, but it's just gonna turn back on
when we move again.

29:43.708 --> 29:46.000
So, why are we standing still now?

29:46.083 --> 29:48.250
I don't know. I'm not good at this.

29:48.333 --> 29:49.333
I know.

30:04.083 --> 30:05.125
And we're criminals.

30:05.208 --> 30:07.333
Go.

30:07.416 --> 30:08.750
Alarm.

30:09.500 --> 30:10.625
It's loud.

30:12.625 --> 30:13.625
Alarm.

30:13.708 --> 30:15.916
Two, two, two, one.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.458
Be careful. Don't slip.

30:17.541 --> 30:19.250
Okay.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.916
They did leave in a hurry.

30:24.541 --> 30:26.741
- Where'd you see the kid's jacket?
- It was right here.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.083
Well, we tried.

30:29.166 --> 30:31.958
A jacket can't just get up and walk away.
It has to be here somewhere.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.500
Hey, don't bail on me.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.916
We're a team.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.041
O-Okay.

30:38.833 --> 30:41.791
Him? I knew he was weird.

30:41.875 --> 30:45.583
All we have to do
is find that ugly, little boy.

30:45.666 --> 30:50.583
And then some crazy, old lady
will pay us $200,000 for him.

30:50.666 --> 30:53.625
Two-hundred grand
just to put him in a room,

30:53.708 --> 30:57.375
clean him off with her little brushes,
and show him off to all her friends.

30:57.458 --> 31:04.166
May I feed him
a piece of this gross, old lady candy?

31:04.250 --> 31:06.125
Of course. That's all he eats.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.750
Oh, Gertrude. He's perfect.

31:10.833 --> 31:12.666
Worth every penny.

31:23.291 --> 31:26.250
Five grand for an ugly, porcelain kid.

31:26.333 --> 31:29.708
I didn't get half that for my real kids.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.375
We're not leaving here without him.

31:33.458 --> 31:34.958
I don't think so.

31:40.625 --> 31:41.625
The jacket.

31:42.875 --> 31:45.375
Homebot, call the police.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.291
There's someone home.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.500
And she's German.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.750
Okay, on three, we run. One.

32:08.208 --> 32:09.375
Ow, ow.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.083
Whoa, that was fast.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.458
Evening.

32:31.541 --> 32:32.541
Hi.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.291
Hello, Officer.

32:37.958 --> 32:40.166
Did somebody slip and fall?

32:41.416 --> 32:43.416
Ha! Busted.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.083
Is this your residence?

32:45.166 --> 32:47.083
Well, I certainly hope so.

32:47.166 --> 32:51.791
Otherwise, I've been cleaning somebody
else's sinks for the past 14 years.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.333
Sinks.

32:54.416 --> 32:56.125
Is there a problem, Officer?

32:56.208 --> 32:58.291
Honey, why don't you go warm up the car?

32:59.958 --> 33:03.416
We got a call.
Your home alarm's been triggered.

33:04.041 --> 33:07.250
Yeah, well,
the code is our anniversary, so…

33:08.000 --> 33:10.625
you think he's gonna remember that?

33:11.458 --> 33:14.875
I'm sure you never forget
your anniversary, do you, Officer?

33:14.958 --> 33:17.875
Oh, no, no.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.791
No ring on this finger, ma'am.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.208
No one's been able to tame
this wild stallion.

33:24.458 --> 33:28.083
Well, I envy the filly
who eventually ropes you in.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.333
Another time, another place.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.875
A whole lot of what-ifs, Officer.

33:35.958 --> 33:39.833
Anyway, I'm so sorry
we wasted your time.

33:41.375 --> 33:43.875
Is there anything else
I can help you with tonight?

33:44.625 --> 33:46.125
No, don't worry 'bout it. No.

33:47.125 --> 33:50.625
Unless you want me to arrest your husband
for missing your anniversary, huh?

33:52.083 --> 33:55.833
Is it bad if a part of me says,
"Yeah, I do want that"?

33:58.291 --> 33:59.583
What's so funny?

33:59.666 --> 34:01.333
Get it?

34:02.500 --> 34:04.833
What are you waiting for? Detain them.

34:04.916 --> 34:06.500
- Now...
- Detain them!

34:07.750 --> 34:08.791
What was that?

34:16.750 --> 34:18.750
Nah, nah, we're all good.

34:20.375 --> 34:24.416
What say you and your hubby
have a nice holiday.

34:25.458 --> 34:26.500
And a good night.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.833
Wait, you're letting them get away.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.500
And... And then those people
broke into my house,

34:32.583 --> 34:33.958
- and I-I-I...
- Whoa, whoa.

34:34.041 --> 34:37.375
- …think they're trying to kidnap me or...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:37.458 --> 34:41.791
Are you saying your parents
left you home alone?

34:41.875 --> 34:44.791
Alone? Alone? Alone?

34:48.750 --> 34:51.208
Why did you have to
tell anyone, Max?

34:51.291 --> 34:54.625
Why did you have to open your big mouth?

34:59.500 --> 35:01.583
Maybe the police is a bad idea.

35:06.291 --> 35:07.291
Nice couple.

35:08.708 --> 35:09.875
You know what?

35:10.666 --> 35:14.916
This whole house-to-myself thing might not
have been the best idea, Homebot.

35:17.333 --> 35:19.708
How do you
switch back to English?

35:19.791 --> 35:21.625
Changing language to English.

35:21.708 --> 35:23.458
Oh, that was easy.

35:24.041 --> 35:27.000
Homebot, call Mum.

35:27.083 --> 35:31.625
I'm sorry. Voice calling is not available
on this Homebot device.

35:31.708 --> 35:33.333
So what do I do, Homebot?

35:33.416 --> 35:36.500
I can't call my mum,
and if I tell the police or anyone else,

35:36.583 --> 35:38.500
they'll put my parents in jail.

35:38.583 --> 35:43.041
A blue whale's veins are big enough
for an adult human to swim through.

35:43.125 --> 35:45.500
How is that supposed to help?

35:45.583 --> 35:47.916
What time is it in Tokyo?

35:48.000 --> 35:52.916
It is 11:37 a.m. tomorrow in Tokyo, Japan.

35:53.583 --> 35:54.750
Night, Homebot.

35:55.583 --> 35:56.833
Good night, Max.

35:58.166 --> 35:59.791
What?

35:59.875 --> 36:02.041
Wha... Are you... Are you serious?

36:02.125 --> 36:04.041
So at no point you thought
to check with me?

36:04.125 --> 36:06.375
You just assumed
that Max was on the other flight?

36:06.458 --> 36:08.625
We didn't take a census. I...

36:08.708 --> 36:11.875
Stu, did you assume he was on the plane?

36:11.958 --> 36:15.208
Carol, I swear to you. That boy
was not in the house when we left.

36:15.291 --> 36:17.458
And where do you think he was, Stu?

36:17.541 --> 36:20.208
At the... At the Four freaking Seasons?

36:20.291 --> 36:21.666
He had fish curry on the plane.

36:21.750 --> 36:24.000
We probably got a hard 30
before we're gonna see Stu.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.541
You do realize that,
because of you, I'm in Japan,

36:26.625 --> 36:30.833
and my ten... ten-year-old son
is at home by himself?

36:30.916 --> 36:33.833
Yeah, but... but first-world problems,
you know?

36:33.916 --> 36:36.666
- First-world problems?
- Stop it. Listen, listen, stop it!

36:36.750 --> 36:37.916
I got that at Brookstone.

36:38.875 --> 36:40.000
Dad's five minutes away.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.916
He's at the travel desk
and could only get one ticket home.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.541
Yes, hello. Beechtree Lane.

36:45.625 --> 36:46.945
- With two...
- Beech with two E's.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.458
Can you send an officer right away?

36:48.541 --> 36:50.291
Did somebody call the house?

36:50.375 --> 36:53.666
No, because we don't have a landline.
Nobody has a landline anymore.

36:53.750 --> 36:57.333
Yes, Stu, nobody has a landline anymore
because it's not 1993.

36:57.416 --> 37:02.083
What's your next idea? Should I beep him
after I listen to the new MC Hammer joint?

37:02.166 --> 37:04.206
What about the neighbors?
Call one of the neighbors.

37:04.250 --> 37:07.041
- Activate the prayer chain.
- We don't know the neighbors, Blake.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.250
We only moved there two months ago.
I don't think we even know their names.

37:10.333 --> 37:13.000
Everybody we know is back in London.

37:13.083 --> 37:14.500
Well, Mum, where are you going?

37:14.583 --> 37:18.625
I'm going to go to the airport, darling,
because I can't sit here while my son is...

37:18.708 --> 37:20.625
I mean... God, where is my passport?

37:20.708 --> 37:23.375
- It's in your hand.
- It's in my hand. It's in my hand.

37:23.458 --> 37:27.125
See, Carol? Under stress, people make
mistakes that we should forgive.

37:27.208 --> 37:29.791
You know? People forget passports.
People forget...

37:29.875 --> 37:31.791
- No!
- Stop it.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.958
Oh, darling, happy Christmas.
Mummy loves you very much. Okay?

37:35.041 --> 37:36.916
Uh, what's happening?
Did Carol leave?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.125
Travel safe.

37:38.208 --> 37:39.541
What... What's going on?

37:46.833 --> 37:49.583
Car 18, car 18.
You near Lincoln Heights?

37:49.666 --> 37:52.500
We got a call about a minor,
one Maxwell Mercer.

37:52.583 --> 37:55.541
Parents are on vacation
and think he might have been left behind.

37:55.625 --> 37:58.541
- Address is 36 Beechtree Lane.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

37:59.416 --> 38:00.916
Um…

38:01.916 --> 38:05.750
You can ignore that.
That is a prank call. Over.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.500
- Prank call?
- Yep.

38:08.458 --> 38:12.708
Listen, when I was a kid,
my family went on vacation.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.958
We forgot my little brother Kevin.

38:17.541 --> 38:18.583
Twice.

38:20.208 --> 38:24.375
He called in the 289 to mess with me.
The idiot does it every year.

38:25.208 --> 38:27.083
Are, uh, you sure about that?

38:27.166 --> 38:28.583
Yes, I'm sure about that!

38:28.666 --> 38:34.333
I know for a fact that there is
no forgotten child at that address.

38:34.416 --> 38:38.083
I was just there
for a bogus home-alarm call, okay?

38:39.125 --> 38:43.916
Guess what? The place had
a McCallister Home Alarm system.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.791
Oh, gee, a coincidence? I don't think so.

38:49.958 --> 38:55.291
Yeah. So can you
just drive by and check it out?

38:59.083 --> 39:01.458
Ten-four. I'm on my way now.

39:08.291 --> 39:12.458
Nice try, Kevin. Nice try.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.750
Trout sniffer.

39:26.875 --> 39:28.000
Hey, guys.

39:29.041 --> 39:31.625
Hey. We saved you some seats
'cause you were running late.

39:31.708 --> 39:33.541
- People are still coming in.
- Hi.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.291
Hey, we saved you a seat
'cause you were running late to church.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.375
Yep. Thanks.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.258
I've got an app
that will ping your assistant,

39:39.291 --> 39:41.392
let you know when you're running late.
I'll send it to you.

39:41.416 --> 39:42.958
- Great.
- Okay. Thank you.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.958
Hey, so that dress is really…

39:49.208 --> 39:50.208
Hmm?

39:50.291 --> 39:52.416
- Her shoulder is so bare.
- You see the full...

39:52.500 --> 39:53.916
- You see her full shoulder.
- Yeah.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.250
- They grow up so fast, don't they?
- Oh, Gavin. What are you doing here?

39:57.333 --> 39:59.809
Well, it's Christmas Eve. It's the day
that everybody goes to church.

39:59.833 --> 40:00.833
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

40:00.916 --> 40:04.000
Peace be unto you. Peace be unto you.
Is that how you say it? Peace be unto...

40:04.083 --> 40:05.083
Oh, this is nice.

40:26.916 --> 40:29.250
You dudes have been ghosting me.
What up with that?

40:29.833 --> 40:31.750
- No, we're...
- But I've got some news.

40:31.833 --> 40:34.333
Houston, we have an offer.

40:34.916 --> 40:36.125
- What?
- Um.

40:36.833 --> 40:40.458
Um, it's an offer for your dad's,
uh, personal training.

40:40.541 --> 40:42.458
And since you already paid
for that jelly belly,

40:42.541 --> 40:44.916
I'm gonna throw in some abs and thighs.
That's what that is.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.208
- Thank you.
- Great.

40:47.291 --> 40:53.208
Hey, Chris, honey, why don't you go
put that, uh, toy in the toy-drive area.

40:53.291 --> 40:55.666
Yeah, we're so proud of you.
We really are.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.833
Well, I'm definitely a child in need.
Need of this.

41:02.916 --> 41:04.291
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes.

41:04.375 --> 41:06.125
Can I get a shopping cart, please?

41:06.208 --> 41:08.125
- Mmm?
- Shopping cart.

41:09.250 --> 41:10.583
Oh!

41:10.666 --> 41:12.000
No, sweetheart.

41:12.083 --> 41:15.458
These toys are for children
less fortunate than you.

41:15.541 --> 41:19.250
Ah, okay.
Thought it was too good to be true.

41:19.333 --> 41:21.041
Whoa, cool.

41:21.125 --> 41:22.708
Thank you, young man.

41:22.791 --> 41:26.791
And I hope you both have a very,
very happy Christmas.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.458
- That's unlikely.
- Why? What's wrong? Parent trouble?

41:29.541 --> 41:30.708
Yeah.

41:30.791 --> 41:32.125
Tell me about it.

41:32.208 --> 41:34.333
They think I don't notice
that they're stressed,

41:34.416 --> 41:35.958
but it's super obvious.

41:36.041 --> 41:39.833
Some weird guy keeps showing up
pretending to be a personal trainer.

41:39.916 --> 41:41.916
So? What do you say?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.375
- What... Who... Who made this offer?
- Oh, the Breckins.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.458
Remember the young couple from the city?

41:46.541 --> 41:49.541
Yeah, so they need to sign the contract
before the new year.

41:49.625 --> 41:51.541
Something about a tax thing.

41:51.625 --> 41:53.791
- We can't do that.
- That's impossible.

41:53.875 --> 41:56.541
Yeah, rich people. Am I right?
We're the worst.

41:57.125 --> 42:00.833
But listen, we're not gonna get
a better offer than this.

42:00.916 --> 42:04.333
So, why don't you take the holiday,
think it over and get back to me.

42:04.416 --> 42:07.750
All right? No presh.
Well, maybe a little presh.

42:07.833 --> 42:11.000
All right, you know,
it's a lot of presh, actually.

42:11.083 --> 42:13.083
All right, cool. Merry Christmas.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.666
You know what? Can I give you
a couple of my business cards?

42:15.750 --> 42:17.875
Yeah. Gavin Washington. I do real estate.

42:17.958 --> 42:20.000
At least you're with your mum and dad.

42:20.083 --> 42:23.208
Mine have gone to Tokyo.
I'm totally on my own.

42:23.291 --> 42:24.833
That's the coolest thing ever.

42:24.916 --> 42:29.916
I thought it would be,
and for about an hour, it was.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.750
But now I'm just lonely.

42:34.458 --> 42:36.625
Here. Have this.

42:36.708 --> 42:39.125
Sounds like you deserve it
as much as anybody.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.333
- Merry Christmas.
- You too.

42:41.416 --> 42:44.625
Enjoy it with your family.
That's what makes it special.

42:47.541 --> 42:48.666
Nice kid.

42:50.166 --> 42:54.041
Thank you. You're a kind little boy.

42:54.125 --> 42:57.875
I think that Santa's gonna bring you
everything you want this year.

42:57.958 --> 43:01.000
That'd be nice, but to be honest,

43:01.083 --> 43:04.208
all I really want is my mum and dad back.

43:04.291 --> 43:08.000
Oh, dear. Well, when did you lose them?

43:08.083 --> 43:09.916
Um, two days ago.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.750
Oh. Right at Christmas?
You poor little thing.

43:14.833 --> 43:16.708
But who's taking care of you?

43:16.791 --> 43:21.333
Uh, it's just me and Goobie at home,
but we're getting by all right.

43:21.416 --> 43:24.250
For Zion's sake,
I will not keep silent…

43:24.333 --> 43:26.041
Pam. Pam, it's the kid.

43:28.625 --> 43:31.541
You're right. It is. Who's the old lady?

43:32.208 --> 43:34.416
Oh, at the open house, the kid's mom said

43:34.500 --> 43:37.541
she was gonna leave the kid behind
with the grandmother.

43:37.625 --> 43:39.583
I can't believe
she went through with that.

43:39.666 --> 43:42.750
So grandma's the German.

43:42.833 --> 43:45.083
Grandma's the German.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.750
All right. So what's the plan?

43:48.833 --> 43:52.708
It's perfect. We go now while
they're not home and get our doll back.

43:52.791 --> 43:56.250
The way old ladies drive, we'll be in
and out before they leave the parking lot.

44:01.041 --> 44:04.250
Wow, I need to come to church more often.

44:17.750 --> 44:19.541
The street's too hot right now.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.000
We'll wait till it gets dark.

44:21.083 --> 44:22.500
We'll go around back.

44:23.125 --> 44:25.125
Okay, Axel Foley.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.833
Standby...

44:37.583 --> 44:43.666
Standby.

44:43.750 --> 44:45.791
- Sorry, did you just hear stand... standby?
- Huh?

44:46.375 --> 44:50.833
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

44:50.916 --> 44:51.958
Um…

44:53.791 --> 44:56.375
Sorry, uh, sorry. Uh, konnichiwa.

44:57.625 --> 45:02.166
When will the...
The stand... the standby seats,

45:02.250 --> 45:04.416
um, be announced? When?

45:04.500 --> 45:05.750
A-Announced?

45:07.500 --> 45:11.291
Ma'am, I'd be more than happy to help you
after you stand in the line behind you.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.500
Thank you, and happy season.

45:15.250 --> 45:19.083
I am trying to get home to my son,

45:19.166 --> 45:22.250
who's alone and scared,
and he needs his mother.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.708
So I need you to answer my question
right now.

45:26.958 --> 45:30.166
Standby seat assignments will be announced
after the check-in window closes

45:30.250 --> 45:32.416
approximately one hour before departure.

45:34.375 --> 45:35.500
Thank you.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
And sorry.

45:37.833 --> 45:38.875
And sorry.

45:38.958 --> 45:42.875
Oh, not a problem.
Thank you for flying with us.

45:44.583 --> 45:45.583
Hi.

45:46.208 --> 45:47.416
So we're doing this?

45:47.500 --> 45:48.875
Yeah, just act casual.

45:50.416 --> 45:51.833
- Just going for a walk.
- Yeah.

45:51.916 --> 45:56.125
It's just a stroll through
people's backyards a-at night.

45:56.208 --> 45:58.125
Through some undergrowth.

45:58.208 --> 46:00.416
- It's the most natural thing in the world.
- Yeah.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.916
Do you know where you're going?

46:05.000 --> 46:06.583
Yes. Now follow me.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
…you shall be a crown of beauty
in the hands of the Lord.

46:11.083 --> 46:12.291
Hey, where are they?

46:12.375 --> 46:15.708
"Forgot to preheat the oven.
Be back soon."

46:16.291 --> 46:18.583
- That's a two-person job?
- I don't know.

46:18.666 --> 46:20.416
- Shh.
- Oh, look. It's starting.

46:20.500 --> 46:23.375
- Oh, here we go.
- Oh, look at Abby. She looks so good.

46:32.291 --> 46:33.291
This is it.

46:37.750 --> 46:39.541
Why's the wall so high?

46:39.625 --> 46:42.333
It's not like it's Buckingham Palace.

46:42.416 --> 46:44.333
Okay. Here's what we'll do.

46:44.416 --> 46:47.625
I'm gonna boost you up, and then when you
get to the top, you'll lift me up.

46:47.708 --> 46:49.750
- Do you think you can do that?
- Yeah.

46:49.833 --> 46:50.833
Okay.

46:50.916 --> 46:52.750
Okay, okay.

46:52.833 --> 46:53.833
Okay. Ready?

46:53.916 --> 46:55.458
Okay.

47:01.833 --> 47:03.750
Just... Whoa!

47:03.833 --> 47:05.208
Just... Ow!

47:08.833 --> 47:10.500
Okay. Just...

47:13.416 --> 47:15.375
One, two.

47:16.708 --> 47:18.148
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

47:18.208 --> 47:20.083
I'm sorry.

47:21.041 --> 47:22.416
Just get up there.

47:23.000 --> 47:25.458
Okay. Three.

47:27.833 --> 47:29.916
- Now climb up me.
- Okay.

47:33.958 --> 47:36.875
Oh, no!

47:45.958 --> 47:47.375
Take my hand.

47:57.333 --> 47:58.791
Get up there.

48:03.666 --> 48:04.875
Okay.

48:05.458 --> 48:06.458
I'm nearly up.

48:20.541 --> 48:22.708
It's okay, Pam. I...

48:25.708 --> 48:26.916
Oh.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.166
A gate.

48:34.833 --> 48:35.833
Oh.

48:35.916 --> 48:38.041
A side gate? Really?

48:38.750 --> 48:41.333
I'm sorry, but it's not like
you saw the gate either.

48:41.416 --> 48:44.125
Oh, I'm... I'm fine by the way.
Thank you.

48:50.833 --> 48:52.291
Come on.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.500
What?

49:08.625 --> 49:10.666
Oh.

49:10.750 --> 49:12.625
That's our little girl.

49:14.541 --> 49:16.375
- Try the door.
- Okay.

49:25.041 --> 49:29.166
"…the difference being
that the clothes are made to fit you,

49:29.250 --> 49:30.930
while you have to be made
to fit the tree."

49:31.000 --> 49:33.041
Better not
let your father hear you say that.

49:33.125 --> 49:34.250
Okay, Mom.

49:34.333 --> 49:36.125
"…wanted to with their buckets.

49:36.208 --> 49:39.291
And how ardently they grew to love their…"

49:42.958 --> 49:46.416
- The wrong house. That's on me.
- Yeah, yeah. I get the sense it was.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.958
Okay, let's just go next door.

49:48.041 --> 49:50.041
That's where he lives.
We're gonna check it out.

49:57.166 --> 49:59.250
We're in a swimming pool!

49:59.333 --> 50:01.166
We're freezing!

50:01.250 --> 50:04.250
Pulling you up! Come here!

50:04.333 --> 50:06.625
Come on!

50:06.708 --> 50:08.750
- What should I do?
- Get on my back!

50:13.708 --> 50:17.000
"…one step, they leapt
into the sky toward Neverland."

50:17.083 --> 50:19.458
Why are man and lady drowning?

50:19.541 --> 50:22.291
No. They're not drowning.
They're in the sky flying.

50:22.375 --> 50:25.500
- Okay.
- I'm up. I'm up. Okay.

50:27.083 --> 50:28.875
Swim. Swim to me.

50:30.125 --> 50:31.125
I got you.

50:31.708 --> 50:33.500
Pull you up. Come here.

50:35.791 --> 50:37.250
And you're out.

50:48.083 --> 50:49.500
What are we doing?

50:50.375 --> 50:51.583
I am a teacher.

50:52.541 --> 50:53.750
You're a data…

50:55.208 --> 50:57.875
- manager.
- Migration manager.

50:59.916 --> 51:02.708
Maybe the universe is trying to
tell us something, you know?

51:02.791 --> 51:05.083
I mean, maybe we
should just cut our losses.

51:15.250 --> 51:16.250
No.

51:17.125 --> 51:18.500
We're not giving up.

51:19.125 --> 51:20.500
We need a W, Pam.

51:22.541 --> 51:23.958
A win.

51:24.541 --> 51:25.583
Yeah.

51:26.708 --> 51:28.166
We do deserve a W.

51:29.916 --> 51:31.750
We're good people, Pam.

51:31.833 --> 51:34.666
And we're gonna lose our home
because Harry stinkin' Potter

51:34.750 --> 51:38.500
comes into our house and steals
the only thing that can fix our problems.

51:39.541 --> 51:42.500
No. That's an injustice.

51:43.875 --> 51:45.791
Yeah. That's not fair.

51:45.875 --> 51:50.000
And... And who are we if we give up now?
I mean, what do we say to our kids?

51:50.083 --> 51:51.963
"Oh, sorry we flushed your life
down the toilet,"

51:52.000 --> 51:54.916
but life kept smacking us down
with klepto kids

51:55.000 --> 51:58.166
"and German grandmothers
and the stupid cloud."

51:58.875 --> 52:01.541
I hate you, cloud.

52:01.625 --> 52:03.041
Enough is enough.

52:03.666 --> 52:09.333
Our W, our family's W, is in that house,
and we're gonna get it.

52:09.416 --> 52:11.958
Right now.

52:12.625 --> 52:14.583
Well, I don't know about right now.
Becau...

52:14.666 --> 52:16.375
I mean, they could come home
at any second.

52:16.458 --> 52:19.083
Also, my pants are starting to freeze.

52:19.166 --> 52:20.666
Oh, mine too.

52:21.750 --> 52:22.916
Like, I don't feel that.

52:24.041 --> 52:25.250
At all.

52:25.333 --> 52:29.250
So let's come back later, you know?
Like after dinner, after b-bedtime even.

52:29.333 --> 52:32.708
Midnight, you know? Like after...
After the old lady's gone to sleep.

52:32.791 --> 52:34.458
Yeah, but what if the kid wakes up?

52:34.541 --> 52:36.083
You know, kids are always running down

52:36.166 --> 52:38.291
in the middle of the night
to see if Santa came.

52:39.625 --> 52:41.041
What if I dress as Santa?

52:42.250 --> 52:44.625
He'll think I'm just Saint Nick.

52:44.708 --> 52:46.166
But this Santa's gonna be leaving

52:46.250 --> 52:49.583
with that $200,000 ugly little boy
in his sack.

52:50.291 --> 52:52.333
And that's how we win.

52:53.333 --> 52:56.625
Okay. Midnight it is, Mr. Claus.

53:05.875 --> 53:08.875
I'm not spending my best years
in some old lady's bedroom.

53:09.458 --> 53:11.791
Homebot, search good booby traps.

53:11.875 --> 53:16.000
I'm sorry, the parental controls
of this system restrict the term "booby."

53:16.083 --> 53:17.375
Never mind.

53:18.875 --> 53:21.666
- I love this dress.
- Ollie, Ollie, what is that?

53:21.750 --> 53:23.791
- Hey, did you take that from the church?
- Oh?

53:23.875 --> 53:24.875
What...

53:25.375 --> 53:26.625
Oh.

53:26.708 --> 53:29.833
Mom, Dad, where were you?

53:29.916 --> 53:31.458
And wha... what happened?

53:31.541 --> 53:35.041
A car drove through a puddle
and splashed us.

53:35.125 --> 53:36.541
What is...

53:36.625 --> 53:38.375
- Yuck.
- Imagine that.

53:39.208 --> 53:40.416
- Ew.
- Hmm.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.875
Well, we should get dinner ready, huh?

53:42.958 --> 53:44.000
Yeah.

54:12.166 --> 54:14.208
- Sorry.
- Am I looking at your screen?

54:14.291 --> 54:15.625
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

54:15.708 --> 54:17.625
- Yes.
- I didn't even realize I'm doing it.

54:17.708 --> 54:19.583
- Classic.
- Yeah.

54:27.208 --> 54:29.267
- Sorry, you're doing it again.
- I'm still doing it?

54:29.291 --> 54:31.333
- Yes.
- I just... I just can't help it, you know?

54:31.416 --> 54:33.625
This is my screen,
and that's your screen, so…

54:33.708 --> 54:36.625
- No, I know that. I know how screens work.
- Yeah.

54:37.250 --> 54:39.541
You know they got TV and films on there?

54:39.625 --> 54:42.625
Yep, yep, fully aware.
I'm just, um, eager to get home.

54:43.208 --> 54:45.648
It's like watching a watched pot, though.
It's not gonna boil.

54:45.708 --> 54:48.875
Yeah, well, it might one day.

54:48.958 --> 54:50.166
Okay.

54:50.250 --> 54:52.666
- I'll just get some sleep.
- Thank you.

54:52.750 --> 54:55.291
- Would you like some of my blanket? Okay.
- No.

55:00.750 --> 55:03.500
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

55:08.333 --> 55:11.000
So, Mei wanted to spend Christmas
in Hawaii this year,

55:11.083 --> 55:13.291
but I told her, we just gotta suck it up
and come here

55:13.375 --> 55:15.250
because I knew you guys
would appreciate it.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.458
He could be a model, and he's only...

55:46.541 --> 55:49.625
- How old are you? Four, right?
- Like a runway model?

55:49.708 --> 55:53.958
Any kind of model. They say he has
an incredible body for a boy his age.

57:10.166 --> 57:12.041
- Here you go. Just for the kids.
- Chris.

57:13.083 --> 57:15.083
No.

57:15.166 --> 57:17.059
That's not the most expensive thing
we bought you.

57:17.083 --> 57:18.958
We can't keep those. Thank you.

57:51.250 --> 57:54.041
Oh, look at those snuggly,
little elves all ready for bed.

57:54.125 --> 57:56.958
Only a half-hour left till Christmas.
See you in the morning.

58:16.375 --> 58:18.166
Locked and loaded.

58:19.041 --> 58:20.291
Okay, we have a plan.

58:20.375 --> 58:23.750
If we stick to it, we'll be back
before anyone will even notice.

58:25.708 --> 58:27.666
Honey, slow down.

58:28.625 --> 58:29.833
Babe, slow down.

58:29.916 --> 58:32.250
I'm trying. It's so icy.

58:32.333 --> 58:33.458
Put on the brakes!

58:33.541 --> 58:35.791
- Steer into the slide.
- No.

58:35.875 --> 58:39.250
You pump into a slide,
and you steer into a skid.

58:39.333 --> 58:40.916
- Which one is this?
- I'm not sure.

58:48.208 --> 58:49.791
Yes.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.375
- Okay.
- Okay. It's all over.

58:57.458 --> 58:59.458
- Could've been worse. Could've...
- Yeah.

59:10.291 --> 59:14.208
Okay. Let's shake that off and focus.

59:14.958 --> 59:17.125
We are doing this.

59:17.208 --> 59:18.958
We are doing it.

59:19.916 --> 59:21.583
We'll be in and out before you...

59:23.833 --> 59:26.750
This is not going well.

59:27.583 --> 59:29.416
I think I shattered my coccyx.

59:30.750 --> 59:32.916
Be careful, Jeff. It's slippery.

59:33.791 --> 59:36.583
Oh, really? Thanks for letting me know.

59:41.708 --> 59:43.750
I think I've worked out a good method.

59:45.708 --> 59:46.708
How are you doing?

59:46.791 --> 59:48.125
Good. I'm getting there.

59:48.208 --> 59:49.791
I'm gonna make it.

59:50.458 --> 59:51.916
All right. I'm doing this.

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
- I'm right behind you, babe.
- One more step and I got it.

59:59.625 --> 01:00:01.708
- Save me!
- Okay. I got you.

01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:12.958
The motion sensor.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.000
- Hide.
- Why is it so bright?

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:16.958
Why is it so dark?

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.125
Come over here, honey. Come over here.

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:31.416
- Okay.
- Quick, quick.

01:00:33.125 --> 01:00:34.250
Oh!

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:36.208
Yes!

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:38.583
What's the lumen count on that thing?

01:00:38.666 --> 01:00:40.000
Oh, man.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:43.291
Hey, what if they're awake?

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:47.166
Wait here.

01:00:48.041 --> 01:00:49.125
Oh.

01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.500
Now it's re-tangling.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.083
Go the other way. Now turn. Face.

01:00:55.166 --> 01:00:57.166
- It's getting more wrapped up.
- Rotate.

01:00:58.166 --> 01:01:00.125
- You're not helping.
- Yes, I am.

01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:02.291
- Okay. Yeah, I did it.
- Okay.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.541
I'm going round back.

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:16.333
Aw.

01:01:23.291 --> 01:01:26.916
"Dear Santa. I tried waiting up
for you, but I'm too sleepy.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.375
Come on in!"

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:31.375
Aw.

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:36.625
Mmm.

01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:45.833
Milk hot!

01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:47.958
Why milk hot?

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:16.458
Hmm.

01:02:23.291 --> 01:02:24.708
Bombs away.

01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.541
Stop! Stop!

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:36.166
You know, I guess my mum was right.
Soda is bad for you.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.625
Wait! We just want our doll...

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.875
Stop! We can talk.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:42.583
We just want our...

01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:48.208
How the heck do you have so much soda?

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.625
My parents buy in bulk.
It's more cost effective.

01:02:53.166 --> 01:02:56.875
And forget about taking
this $200,000 ugly boy.

01:02:57.916 --> 01:02:59.333
We're not here to hurt you.

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:04.625
Please, just calm down,
and we can talk about this rationally.

01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:08.916
So easy on the soda, okay?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Ah.

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:21.541
Ouch! Ouch!

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:23.750
Ow! Ow! Ooh!

01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:45.500
Alarm!

01:03:47.166 --> 01:03:49.083
One, one, one, two...

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:55.541
Santa? Is that you?

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.541
Ho! Ho! Ho! How are you, little boy?

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:02.583
Orange stripe, center pocket.

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:03.708
No!

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:10.541
Ooh! That did not sound right.

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:40.000
So hot and so cold
at the same time.

01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:43.458
Jeff?

01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:46.166
Jeff!

01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:55.708
Where am I?

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:59.375
What? This...

01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:01.166
I'm scared.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:04.708
What is this?

01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:10.666
Okay. I'm okay. I have all my parts.

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:17.625
Am I dead? Is this dead?

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.791
That's too high! I'm too high.

01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:27.625
I don't like...

01:05:27.708 --> 01:05:29.458
Where have you taken me?

01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:31.500
You can do this, McKenzie.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:33.833
Okay, you just gotta make it across.

01:05:33.916 --> 01:05:35.166
Just one small jump.

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:43.500
One, two, three!

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.500
Jeff?

01:05:54.833 --> 01:05:55.916
Jeff?

01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.000
Jeff!

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:05.791
There's something blocking the door.

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:19.291
Oh, honey.

01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:25.666
He's hurting me, Pam.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.791
Me too, baby. Me too.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.291
Little, limey monster
tried to set me on fire.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:35.875
Why's he doing this to us, Pam?

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:39.458
He just told me our 200 grand
is getting away.

01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:42.666
He has our doll,
and he knows what it's worth.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.666
We have to get it back.

01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:58.916
Ow!

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.666
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:09.750
Ow!

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:14.750
The Eiffel Tower? Really?

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:27.875
Don't you dare judge me.
I'm doing this for my family.

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:42.500
You learned anything?

01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:45.458
Just that this kid owns a lot of Legos.

01:07:48.375 --> 01:07:50.000
We are coming in…

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:52.625
I forgot the word for peace.

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:54.188
- Yeah, look it up.
- Okay, let's see.

01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:58.666
"Pancake." No. "Potato." "Paralysis."

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.291
- Up here.
- Oh, hey.

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:04.000
- Okay. So... So listen.
- We just wanna talk.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.791
Would you just stop and talk to us?

01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:14.000
Please!

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:16.582
We are coming in Frieden.

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:18.750
Frieden is peace.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:20.791
Come on up and get me!

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Ouch.

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:30.707
He put butter on the stairs.

01:08:30.791 --> 01:08:35.666
Flour, milk and butter.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:37.125
He's turning me into a cookie.

01:08:37.207 --> 01:08:39.332
Well, you need sugar for a cookie.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:49.707
Who raised this little monster?

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.416
I think we should go back home.

01:08:53.082 --> 01:08:54.666
There is no going back.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:56.541
This is who we are now.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:59.041
This is the life we've chosen.

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.125
We've gone to the other side.

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:08.582
You'll never find me.

01:09:35.625 --> 01:09:38.082
Harry Potter turned me into a pincushion.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.416
Good job, honey. I'll be right there.

01:09:54.207 --> 01:09:55.333
Or not.

01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:03.833
Well, hello.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:13.708
Catch.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.875
Oh, no. You hit me
with the incredibly soft yoga ball.

01:10:35.625 --> 01:10:37.125
Go get him, Jeff.

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:43.625
Given up yet? Or are you thirsty for more?

01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:55.708
Eight ball. Your face.

01:11:00.208 --> 01:11:02.416
There's nowhere to run now, little man.

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:05.375
We'll see about that.

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:10.333
See ya.

01:11:15.625 --> 01:11:17.750
Pam, he jumped off the balcony!

01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:19.791
Good.

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:24.125
The jacket.

01:11:26.541 --> 01:11:28.500
Oh, no. A ladder.

01:11:29.541 --> 01:11:32.375
You really think I'm that stupid?

01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:46.291
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:50.375
Dolly?

01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:58.458
What?

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:05.041
Aw.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.375
That's it. Time's up, little guy.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:34.166
No!

01:12:41.333 --> 01:12:42.541
That's far enough.

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.833
Well, hello there.

01:12:47.541 --> 01:12:49.375
I'll do it.

01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:52.416
Please, please, please no more pool balls.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.333
Drop the gun.

01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:57.208
Not a chance.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:13:00.166
I'm not playing around, lady.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:03.708
He's not. He... He shot me
with several pool balls tonight.

01:13:03.791 --> 01:13:05.000
Enough!

01:13:05.083 --> 01:13:06.625
This stops here.

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:10.375
You picked the wrong mom to mess with.

01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.833
Honey, are you okay?

01:13:28.833 --> 01:13:32.916
Please, no more Legos or fire

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.208
or freaking thumbtacks.
We just wanna talk.

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:38.791
Yeah, right. I heard your plan.

01:13:38.875 --> 01:13:41.125
You wanna kidnap "the ugly boy"

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:44.208
and sell me to some old lady
for 200 large.

01:13:44.291 --> 01:13:45.291
What?

01:13:45.916 --> 01:13:46.916
What?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.708
And I'm not ugly.
My mum says I've got character.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.000
You thought...

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:57.291
Is that why you made this death maze?

01:13:57.375 --> 01:13:59.333
Kid, we just want our doll back.

01:13:59.416 --> 01:14:00.541
What doll?

01:14:00.625 --> 01:14:05.333
The one you stole from our house.
The boy with the bad face. The ugly boy.

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:08.125
That? I didn't steal that.

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:12.250
I'm ten years old.
Why on earth would I want a doll?

01:14:15.541 --> 01:14:20.166
Oh, no. This is bad.

01:14:21.291 --> 01:14:22.500
We did a bad thing.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:26.208
One of the worst bads we could've done.

01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:31.208
I think we need to wake up your grandma.

01:14:31.291 --> 01:14:33.791
You wanna call my grandma in England?

01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:37.250
No. The grandma who's staying here.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:39.416
From Germany.

01:14:42.541 --> 01:14:44.291
My grandma's not staying with me.

01:14:45.291 --> 01:14:46.875
Well, then who is?

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.666
No one. It's just me.

01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:00.666
What?

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:02.666
Wait, where are your parents?

01:15:05.458 --> 01:15:06.916
Tokyo.

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:12.958
Oh. Sweetie, I am so sorry.

01:15:13.791 --> 01:15:16.708
If we had known you were staying here
by yourself,

01:15:16.791 --> 01:15:19.250
we would've handled things
a lot differently.

01:15:20.625 --> 01:15:23.375
We wouldn't have broken into your home
even once.

01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:26.500
This was just a huge misunderstanding.

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:29.541
Now, why don't you just put
that heavy gun down?

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:33.041
Oh, sweetie, come here.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.625
You're safe now.

01:15:34.708 --> 01:15:36.875
We'll take care of you, okay?

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:39.375
Okay.

01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:58.166
Okay, I know what it looks like…

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:01.791
But that was genuinely an accident.

01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:03.416
Well, I hope so.

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.791
Because... No.

01:16:05.875 --> 01:16:08.916
I gotta go take a... I'm gonna go sit down.

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:13.541
Okay. Let's call your parents
and let them know that you're okay.

01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:16.041
You can stay with us till they get back.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.458
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.291
No, honey.

01:16:21.375 --> 01:16:25.083
Your mom is just gonna be happy
to see you. I promise.

01:16:25.166 --> 01:16:26.291
At first.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:29.500
But... But then you'll be in trouble.

01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:31.666
Pretty bad, I would... I would imagine.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:35.458
I think we're all gonna have
quite a bit of explaining to do.

01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:43.541
Okay, so, you go to this kid's house,
because you think he stole the doll…

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:45.750
…and on the way there, you hit a tree,

01:16:45.833 --> 01:16:46.833
which is why…

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:47.875
Yeah.

01:16:47.958 --> 01:16:50.291
And then when you get to this kid's house,
he's home alone?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.208
- Yes. Pretty much, yeah. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:55.250
Wow.

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:57.250
How about your mom?
Have you talked to her?

01:16:57.333 --> 01:16:59.625
Yeah, we called her when she landed.

01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:03.041
She cried happy tears.
I didn't even know you could do that.

01:17:03.125 --> 01:17:06.375
So, are we moving?

01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:13.750
I'm sorry, guys…

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:17.833
But we got an offer on the house,

01:17:17.916 --> 01:17:21.416
and we can't afford not to take it.

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:25.041
But it's okay,

01:17:25.125 --> 01:17:29.458
because what makes this house
so special to us is us.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:31.125
Right?

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:35.916
Your mum speaks a lot of sense.

01:17:37.166 --> 01:17:41.708
Without my mum and dad,
my house really didn't feel like home.

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:50.250
Oh, babe, what if one of those open house
poacher people took the doll?

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.133
- Mmm, yes.
- Jeff, have you heard about this?

01:17:52.208 --> 01:17:55.375
They just come into your house and take
all of your valuables. It's crazy.

01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:57.791
Greta Van Susteren did a thing about it
on 60 Minutes.

01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.583
- Full hour. Yeah.
- Full hour.

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:01.625
- Who knows?
- Greta Van Susteren knows.

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:05.666
But it's gone now, and,
you know, we need to...

01:18:09.916 --> 01:18:11.083
Ollie?

01:18:12.083 --> 01:18:13.166
Doll.

01:18:14.833 --> 01:18:18.000
Ollie, angel, do not move.

01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:26.291
That was incredible.

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:27.583
Are you okay?

01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:31.708
Yeah. Yeah, I think we both are.

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:35.291
Hey, who would've thought Ollie
was gonna save the day, right?

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:38.458
- Yay, baby. Good job, my love.
- Good job, buddy.

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:48.750
Mum!

01:19:51.666 --> 01:19:54.875
Max. Mmm.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:58.791
Oh. I'm so sorry we left you, darling.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:04.250
Let me look at you.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.666
You've got a great kid.

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:10.166
Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:14.916
He's very creative.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.833
Creative. Yes. He's so creative.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:23.000
Thank you. That's nice to, um...

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.083
Oh.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:27.291
Wow, that really was some fender bender.

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:28.666
Mmm.

01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:30.208
You should see the tree.

01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:36.833
Oh.

01:20:36.916 --> 01:20:38.291
Do... Do you wanna stay?

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:39.875
Because we have a lot of eggnog.

01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:41.767
They got more nog than they know
what to do with.

01:20:41.791 --> 01:20:44.708
Oh. Uh, uh, thank you, but, uh, no.

01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:46.375
I... I, um…

01:20:46.458 --> 01:20:49.000
I just wanna get this guy home now.

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.791
Never been so excited to see my house.

01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:52.250
Actually...

01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:54.500
- Yes! Home.
- Mm-mmm.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.416
Home is where the heart is.

01:20:57.166 --> 01:20:58.500
"Sweet Home Alabama."

01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:01.458
Homer's Odyssey.

01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:04.125
- Where do they wind up at the end?
- Home.

01:21:04.208 --> 01:21:05.208
Spoiler alert.

01:21:05.291 --> 01:21:07.809
You're probably too young to have read it,
but they end up at home.

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:09.125
Yeah, that's lovely.

01:21:09.208 --> 01:21:11.625
- There is no place like home. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:14.625
Come on, you.

01:21:18.166 --> 01:21:19.458
Merry Christmas, Max.

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:21.916
Be good.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.041
You too.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.833
Ooh. I need another hug.

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:26.916
Aw.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.166
I missed you so much.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:31.416
Hey, I hope the house isn't a mess.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.541
Wow.

01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:39.333
Wow.

01:21:39.416 --> 01:21:42.166
- She must be so happy to finally be home.
- Yeah.

01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:49.125
Because I guess home
is just another word for family, right?

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:51.458
So, does that mean we get to stay here?

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.791
- Yeah, sweetie. It does.
- Yes.

01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:01.041
Yeah.

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:06.875
Mommy's ribs. Mommy's ribs are sore.

01:22:06.958 --> 01:22:08.458
So glad they're not poor anymore.

01:22:08.541 --> 01:22:10.625
- It made me so uncomfortable.
- It was so awkward.

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:13.291
Hey, what do you say
we open some presents?

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:14.666
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:18.500
- Can I open the big one?
- Oh, my gosh!

01:22:18.583 --> 01:22:20.500
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:22:20.583 --> 01:22:22.083
- I call opening first.
- Me first.

01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:24.208
Okay, guys. One at a time.

01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:25.958
- Thank you, Dad.
- Thank you.

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.041
I love it.

01:22:28.416 --> 01:22:30.458
You wouldn't believe
how much I missed you.

01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:32.916
It's just gonna be
two of us for Christmas, hey?

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.875
- That'll be nice, won't it?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:34.958 --> 01:22:36.458
Oh, dear. What a day.

01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:39.958
Home sweet home.

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:51.083
There's a very reasonable explanation.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.666
I think he looks
like a little politician.

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.791
- Mum, please.
- He looks like a politician.

01:23:03.875 --> 01:23:07.250
Part of it's the sweater vest.
He does look like a politician.

01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:09.875
- I like it. I actually like it.
- Mum.

01:23:09.958 --> 01:23:13.500
- I don't even know anything about…
- Okay, everybody, time to eat.

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:15.500
Oh, this looks incredible.

01:23:15.583 --> 01:23:18.708
Thank you so much,
and the house looks so beautiful.

01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:20.625
Oh, don't thank me.

01:23:20.708 --> 01:23:21.833
Thank that creepy doll.

01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:26.041
Selling that paid for everything.
Our mortgage, our trip to Europe…

01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:28.000
And your new chandelier.

01:23:28.083 --> 01:23:30.333
- Thank you.
- And don't forget the drywall.

01:23:30.416 --> 01:23:31.416
Oh, yeah. Well...

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.540
I always thought the house could've done
with a little remodeling anyway. So…

01:23:34.583 --> 01:23:38.208
Keep it on those settings, Terry.
All right. Take it easy. All right. Sorry.

01:23:38.291 --> 01:23:40.291
Sorry, everybody. That was work.
Apologies.

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:41.583
On Christmas Day?

01:23:41.666 --> 01:23:45.333
Jeff has been promoted
to District Manager.

01:23:45.416 --> 01:23:47.708
There's no Christmas for the cloud, Mike.

01:23:47.791 --> 01:23:49.250
The cloud never sleeps.

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:52.333
And I provide 24-7 cloud
management services. And that includes...

01:23:52.416 --> 01:23:53.958
Dad.

01:23:54.458 --> 01:23:55.583
Oh.

01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:56.833
Let's make a toast.

01:23:56.916 --> 01:24:00.000
- Yes.
- Oh, um, can I get one of those?

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:07.041
You know, they're quite sugary.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.791
I think we should let him have the soda.

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:11.625
Remember what happened last time?

01:24:15.916 --> 01:24:17.583
- There you go, buddy.
- Thanks.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:19.833
Huh? Oh.

01:24:19.916 --> 01:24:21.083
Cheers.

01:24:22.583 --> 01:24:23.875
To new friends.

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:26.000
- And family.
- Mmm.

01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:28.708
And me having
no permanent neurological damage.

01:24:28.791 --> 01:24:31.416
Yeah, that's good.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:35.000
And here's to Max
for bringing us all together.

01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:36.750
Merry Christmas, everybody.

01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:38.625
- Merry Christmas!
- Cheers.

01:24:38.708 --> 01:24:41.000
Merry Christmas, darling.

01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:42.416
Merry Christmas. Cheers, darling.

01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:46.208
Merry Christmas, everyone!
