WEBVTT

00:03.573 --> 00:07.643
- Oh, please, get serious.
- I'm plenty serious!

00:07.644 --> 00:10.311
That was the very definition
of a sucker punch!

00:10.413 --> 00:13.149
Well?! Even if it was,
which it wasn't,

00:13.184 --> 00:14.216
you would've deserved it!

00:14.217 --> 00:17.051
Wha... For what, saving your
dumb ass from giant lizards?!

00:17.154 --> 00:20.756
- Giant lizards I wouldn't have had to deal with...
- You call that dealing with?!

00:20.757 --> 00:22.657
...if you had fixed
the goddamn fuel pump!

00:22.759 --> 00:26.561
Oh, okay!
So it's all my fault!

00:26.663 --> 00:28.264
Yes!

00:28.265 --> 00:31.967
Well, still a sucker punch.
Ow!

00:31.968 --> 00:33.469
Now, that's a sucker pun...

00:33.470 --> 00:37.039
- Oww! Son of a...
- Ow! Goddamn it!

00:40.810 --> 00:43.012
Hang on! Wait!
Stop it!

00:43.013 --> 00:45.381
- What?!
- That!

00:48.118 --> 00:49.818
Goddamn it.

00:52.756 --> 00:55.190
What?

00:55.292 --> 00:58.594
And frankly, I really don't see
how this is any of your business.

00:58.595 --> 01:00.728
What're you...
I own the business!

01:00.830 --> 01:03.431
- I meant...
- And I own that business over there!

01:03.533 --> 01:07.369
- And I own zis business!
- You don't own the police station!

01:07.370 --> 01:08.571
- Yeah.
- Well, I...

01:08.572 --> 01:11.540
Shut up. And Mother, I think
we're losing sight of how amazing

01:11.541 --> 01:13.274
that landing would've been
if, ya know...

01:13.376 --> 01:15.014
- It worked?
- Right?

01:15.015 --> 01:16.778
And if ifs and buts
were candy and nuts,

01:16.880 --> 01:19.214
- we'd all have a merry Christmas.
- Aww.

01:19.316 --> 01:20.849
And maybe Santa would bring me

01:20.850 --> 01:23.718
a new sixty-thousand
dollar seaplane!

01:23.820 --> 01:25.720
Don't be so dramatic,
she's not a total loss,

01:25.822 --> 01:27.423
she just needs new wings.

01:27.424 --> 01:29.091
- And a fuel pump.
- Woman?

01:29.092 --> 01:32.595
Shipped out here from the States!
God knows when.

01:32.596 --> 01:35.997
It took three months to get
new tubes for the damn radio.

01:36.099 --> 01:38.666
And God knows
how much it'll cost!

01:38.768 --> 01:40.336
Well, and the airplane factory.

01:40.337 --> 01:43.272
- Presumably. Would know.
- You're paying for them.

01:43.273 --> 01:44.940
Well, but you own the business...

01:44.941 --> 01:47.442
Which I will liquidate
like a piña colada.

01:47.544 --> 01:49.244
You're paying for them!

01:49.279 --> 01:50.846
- But...
- And in the meantime...

01:50.847 --> 01:53.181
You'd better figure out
how to replace the money

01:53.283 --> 01:55.750
I won't be making on Archer Airways,

01:55.852 --> 01:59.488
- or you can just pack your suitcase!
- Hmph!

01:59.489 --> 02:01.723
It happens to be a duffel bag!

02:01.825 --> 02:03.725
- That's tellin' her.
- Eh.

02:03.827 --> 02:07.096
<i>- Now, move zis aeroplane from la rue!
- From what?</i>

02:07.097 --> 02:08.797
<i>La rue! La rue!</i>

02:09.866 --> 02:14.068
- What the hell's "larue?"
- I think it's like, a base for sauces?

02:14.170 --> 02:16.504
Ya know, like,
for gravy or whatever?

03:01.654 --> 03:04.923
So I'm thinking new
wings for Lucy are gonna cost

03:04.924 --> 03:08.226
- about five grand...
- Which we don't have...

03:08.328 --> 03:10.461
And which we
can't make without Lucy.

03:10.563 --> 03:11.930
We gotta fly to make money,

03:11.931 --> 03:13.731
but we gotta have
the money to fly, so...

03:13.833 --> 03:16.267
Yeah, that's a real Catch-22.

03:16.369 --> 03:19.337
Uh, I don't think that's a thing yet.

03:19.439 --> 03:22.636
So... Money.
Any ideas?

03:23.109 --> 03:25.878
- Mmmm-nope.
- C'mon, let's just spitball it.

03:25.879 --> 03:27.279
- Noop.
- Pam.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.514
- No.
- C'mon, there are no bad ideas.

03:29.616 --> 03:31.582
Oh, well, isn't that a change?!

03:31.684 --> 03:33.918
- What is?
- All of a sudden it's anything goes!

03:34.020 --> 03:35.720
- What're you...?
- No bad ideas?

03:35.788 --> 03:38.507
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Are you talking about...

03:38.508 --> 03:41.059
- that was a terrible idea!
- No, it wasn't!

03:41.060 --> 03:42.760
We were the laughingstock of the Andes!

03:42.762 --> 03:46.063
- And we lost our asses!
- Okay, yeah, I mean,

03:46.165 --> 03:48.199
maybe it was a little ahead
of its time, but...

03:48.301 --> 03:51.269
- Oh, my God...
- ...it was local, it was sustainable...

03:51.371 --> 03:54.539
- It was rats!
- It wasn't rats!

03:57.343 --> 04:00.611
<i>Dos por uno, dos por uno!</i>

04:00.713 --> 04:02.580
<i>Chinchilladas!</i>

04:02.682 --> 04:07.735
<i>El sabor sensación
que está barriendo la nación!</i>

04:09.055 --> 04:11.022
Goddamn it.

04:11.124 --> 04:13.824
Plus, the fur farms practically
gave us the meat for free.

04:13.927 --> 04:16.093
It's probably free
at the glue factory,

04:16.195 --> 04:18.095
it doesn't mean people wanna eat it.

04:18.197 --> 04:19.964
Because it's
broken-down old horse meat!

04:20.065 --> 04:21.366
Chinchilla, on the other hand,

04:21.367 --> 04:22.768
is some of the finest fur you can buy!

04:22.769 --> 04:25.002
So is mink!
But people don't eat it!

04:25.104 --> 04:28.389
- I've eaten mink.
- I do not doubt that!

04:29.509 --> 04:32.677
- How was it?
- Minky.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.280
All right, Miss Priss...

04:35.281 --> 04:37.048
Let's go, let's see the goods.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.350
Oh, alright, but be nice...

04:39.452 --> 04:42.987
- I didn't have much to work with.
- Hm. You can say that again.

04:43.089 --> 04:44.756
Can't you pad it with something?

04:44.757 --> 04:46.657
- Pad what?
- Your brassiere.

04:46.759 --> 04:48.459
No, I meant my wardrobe!

04:48.561 --> 04:50.261
I packed for a honeymoon, not a...

04:50.330 --> 04:53.431
a descent into profound
and lasting shame!

04:54.934 --> 04:57.368
You're still gonna want to pad it.

04:57.470 --> 04:59.203
Why not?
You heard your mom,

04:59.305 --> 05:02.240
- there's obviously a demand.
- Because I don't think it's feasible

05:02.241 --> 05:04.108
to build a radio tube factory here.

05:04.210 --> 05:06.010
Yeah, there's
probably zoning issues.

05:06.112 --> 05:08.847
- That's your number one concern?
- I haven't ranked them!

05:08.848 --> 05:11.082
Well, mine is rickets,
and scurvy, and scabies,

05:11.184 --> 05:14.785
and whatever other bullshit
diseases poor people get.

05:16.055 --> 05:19.091
Hmmm... I wonder if that
idol's worth anything.

05:19.092 --> 05:20.825
Wait, what?
W-What idol?

05:20.927 --> 05:22.461
I don't know. In the jungle,
the princess and the kraut

05:22.462 --> 05:24.162
were talking about some kind of idol.

05:24.163 --> 05:26.530
- What kind of idol?!
- Some kind, I dunno, they didn't...

05:26.633 --> 05:28.107
- Like a native idol?!
- They...

05:28.142 --> 05:30.535
So that's why that little
German sneak is on the island!

05:30.536 --> 05:33.504
Are we talking jade?!
Emerald?! Ruby?!

05:33.606 --> 05:36.041
- Gold?!
- They didn't say!

05:36.042 --> 05:37.742
I bet it's a gold monkey!

05:37.844 --> 05:39.478
No! Not a gold monkey!

05:39.479 --> 05:41.245
- You don't know that!
- Yes, I do!

05:41.347 --> 05:44.483
- Not a gold monkey.
- But it could be gold, though.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.984
Yeah, I guess, as long
as it's not monkey-shaped.

05:47.086 --> 05:49.321
- What're we talking about?
- Why you're not a dog.

05:49.322 --> 05:51.022
- Shut up, dodos.
- Flightless.

05:51.057 --> 05:52.557
- So where is it?!
- I don't know!

05:52.558 --> 05:54.226
- Where's what?
- The idol!

05:54.227 --> 05:57.095
- Oooh...
- But since they had us fly 'em around

05:57.096 --> 06:02.099
over the jungle...
Oh, for... I assume it's in the jungle.

06:02.201 --> 06:04.168
A golden idol,
somewhere in the jungle.

06:04.270 --> 06:05.671
I bet it's worth millions!

06:07.607 --> 06:10.107
I think you
must sharpen your pencil.

06:10.209 --> 06:12.443
- Excuse me?
- "Sharpen your pencil?"

06:12.545 --> 06:14.146
It is idiom?

06:14.147 --> 06:17.114
- This is a fairly common phrase, no?
- No.

06:17.216 --> 06:20.518
It means there's
a problem with your arithmetic.

06:20.620 --> 06:24.055
My government will pay one
hundred thousand Reichsmarks

06:24.157 --> 06:26.624
for the idol,
und not one pfennig more.

06:26.726 --> 06:29.460
Hmm. I wonder how much
Japan would pay...

06:29.562 --> 06:31.462
What does Japan have to do with this?

06:31.564 --> 06:33.631
Well, I'm sure they'd like to
lease an airfield on the island,

06:33.733 --> 06:36.600
if, say, they ever
declared war on America?

06:36.703 --> 06:39.137
<i>Mein GÃ♪tt.
Are you serious?</i>

06:39.138 --> 06:42.340
The French have subjugated
my people for a hundred years.

06:42.341 --> 06:45.009
I would do literally
anything to be rid of them.

06:45.111 --> 06:47.611
Literally?
Or figuratively?

06:47.714 --> 06:51.817
- Why? What did you have in mind?
- Oh.

06:51.818 --> 06:54.719
Well, it is hard to say,
my mind is quite racing,

06:54.821 --> 06:58.456
- there are many thoughts in there.
- Pick one.

06:58.558 --> 07:02.526
Perhaps we could pay...
five hundred thousand?

07:03.996 --> 07:07.365
- Wait, what are you...?
- Shh. Pretending I'm on the phone.

07:07.366 --> 07:10.835
Hello, Japan?
Hi, yeah. So listen...

07:10.937 --> 07:14.151
All right!
One million Reichsmarks!

07:14.607 --> 07:17.409
Payable only once
we have secured the idol.

07:17.410 --> 07:20.277
And so far, we have no idea
where to even look for it.

07:20.379 --> 07:22.880
As for that, I found this,

07:22.982 --> 07:25.816
hidden among
my great-grandfather's papers...

07:25.918 --> 07:29.386
<i>Fantastich!
So do we have a deal?</i>

07:29.489 --> 07:31.322
If, when the time comes,

07:31.424 --> 07:35.059
Germany helps my people
overthrow the French.

07:35.161 --> 07:37.928
Ja, I think I can safely promise

07:38.030 --> 07:40.898
that soon you won't have
to worry about France.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.635
Then yes, Herr Sebert,
we have a deal.

07:44.737 --> 07:46.371
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

07:46.372 --> 07:50.007
Now then, I believe there
was some mention of a pencil?

07:50.109 --> 07:54.725
<i>Oh, ja, ich habe
eine groÃen Bleistift...</i>

07:54.760 --> 07:57.682
I'll be the judge of that.

07:59.733 --> 08:02.266
Okay, Fuchs is renting
a bungalow on the edge of town,

08:02.369 --> 08:04.569
so I say we break in,
snoop around,

08:04.671 --> 08:08.006
and see what we can find out
about this gold non-monkey.

08:08.108 --> 08:11.076
- So rob him.
- Well, technically burgle, but...

08:11.077 --> 08:13.011
Shut up, but yeah.
For clues.

08:13.113 --> 08:16.849
- Ooh, like maybe there's a map.
- Yes! Like a treasure map!

08:16.850 --> 08:18.883
Yeah, right, with a big X on it,

08:18.985 --> 08:22.854
- treasure chest, skull-and-bones...
- Don't be shitty! And also,

08:22.889 --> 08:25.790
why would the map
have pirate shit all over it?

08:25.892 --> 08:28.659
Well, we are in the shipping lane.

08:28.762 --> 08:32.964
So, you weren't kidding around
about that pencil, huh?

08:33.066 --> 08:35.466
- That is not a topic for levity.
- Fair enough.

08:35.568 --> 08:39.136
It is interesting, I notice zat,
even in the throes of passion,

08:39.239 --> 08:42.073
you have no trace
of a Polynesian accent.

08:42.174 --> 08:44.475
Oh. That's because I was sent away
to boarding in the States

08:44.577 --> 08:46.811
when I was five,
all the way through college.

08:46.913 --> 08:49.113
Und yet you mention alliance with Japan.

08:49.215 --> 08:52.583
I would think your affinity
would lie with the United States.

08:52.685 --> 08:56.187
Right, because that
worked out so well for Hawaii.

08:56.289 --> 08:57.823
I always found it ironic that

08:57.824 --> 09:01.459
if you really want to get bent over,
just ask a missionary.

09:01.561 --> 09:04.028
Fair enough.

09:04.130 --> 09:07.565
So why is the German government
so interested in the tupua?

09:07.667 --> 09:09.801
- The...?
- Tupua. The idol.

09:09.903 --> 09:13.738
- Oh. Well, umm...
- Oh, don't worry about them.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.574
In order join the royal guards,
when they're 12 years old,

09:16.676 --> 09:18.543
they have to agree to have
their tongues cut out, so...

09:18.645 --> 09:19.945
<i>GÃ♪tt im Himmel!</i>

09:19.946 --> 09:23.482
- That was a joke.
- Oh, sorry, I...

09:23.483 --> 09:26.084
Wow, ethnocentric much?

09:26.186 --> 09:28.619
<i>Tu'ua i matou.</i>

09:28.721 --> 09:31.957
So. Tupua...
Germany's interest in.

09:31.958 --> 09:34.492
Ah, yes, well, the FÃ¼hrer, um...

09:34.594 --> 09:36.360
- The Charlie Chaplin guy.
- Nein!

09:36.463 --> 09:40.131
Nein.
We never, ever say this thing.

09:40.233 --> 09:43.768
- Really?
- Trust me. Anyway, the FÃ¼hrer is,

09:43.870 --> 09:46.637
um, a bit of an anthropology buff.

09:46.739 --> 09:48.806
And so Germany
will build a museum.

09:48.908 --> 09:52.043
- Fair enough...
- The most powerful museum in the world!

09:52.145 --> 09:56.148
For children.
Of all ages.

09:56.149 --> 09:58.349
Okay, so here's the plan...

09:58.451 --> 10:01.511
We need to keep Fuchs away from
his bungalow for a few hours,

10:01.613 --> 10:03.746
so after he finishes
eating dinner here...

10:03.848 --> 10:05.182
How do you know
he's gonna eat here?

10:05.183 --> 10:08.719
Where else is he gonna eat?
Luigi's?

10:15.860 --> 10:19.428
- I like Luigi's.
- Yeah, you're also teeming with mites.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.499
- Not teeming.
- So, shut up. After dinner,

10:22.567 --> 10:26.069
- we need to make sure he stays here...
- Mkay.

10:26.070 --> 10:27.738
Don't you wanna know how?

10:27.739 --> 10:30.807
- I'd like to know what, and why.
- What?

10:30.909 --> 10:32.975
What are you goofs doing here,

10:33.077 --> 10:36.112
and follow up,
why are you doing it here?

10:36.214 --> 10:38.114
For your information,
we're working on a plan

10:38.216 --> 10:41.517
to earn enough money to pay you,
and to get new wings, so...

10:41.619 --> 10:43.452
It better not be chinchilladas!

10:43.555 --> 10:45.189
- Oh, my God...
- Heh. Oh, my God!

10:45.190 --> 10:49.225
- See?!
- Chinchilladas! I'd forgotten all about that!

10:49.327 --> 10:52.462
- It's not chinchilladas!
- Jesus... Christ...

10:52.463 --> 10:55.064
Well, whatever it is,
do it somewhere else.

10:55.166 --> 10:56.667
- We can't.
- Why not?!

10:56.668 --> 10:59.001
Hey...
Because we wanna hire her.

10:59.103 --> 11:00.537
Wait, what?

11:00.538 --> 11:02.238
Wait, eww!
Who is "we"?!

11:02.340 --> 11:03.574
- Like, we-we, or...
- Yeah!

11:03.575 --> 11:06.076
No, not...
It's for after dinner.

11:06.077 --> 11:07.777
- Oh, right.
- That makes more sense.

11:07.846 --> 11:10.346
We want her to entertain
the kraut for an hour or so.

11:10.448 --> 11:12.082
That greasy little German guy?!

11:12.083 --> 11:14.050
- No!
- Why are you talking?

11:14.152 --> 11:16.586
Alright, A,
what are you up to,

11:16.688 --> 11:19.021
and B, what's it
got to do with Fuchs?

11:19.123 --> 11:21.557
A, nothing,
and B, also nothing.

11:21.659 --> 11:24.227
- For one hour? A thousand francs.
- What?!

11:24.329 --> 11:25.996
- Wait, is that a lot?
- Yes!

11:25.997 --> 11:27.231
- That depends...
- Yes!

11:27.232 --> 11:28.832
...on if you think 35 bucks is a lot.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.267
- What?!
- Right?!

11:30.268 --> 11:32.034
Well, we have to see
what the market will bear...

11:32.136 --> 11:34.036
And if I only get 40%...

11:34.138 --> 11:36.639
Fourteen goddamn dollars?!

11:36.741 --> 11:39.308
Well, minus your room and board,

11:39.410 --> 11:44.548
- so let's just call it an even... nine.
- Nine dollars?

11:44.549 --> 11:48.218
To have sexual intercourse.
With a total stranger.

11:48.219 --> 11:49.919
I don't know why you're so pissed,

11:49.921 --> 11:52.088
I was a stranger
and you banged me for free.

11:52.190 --> 11:54.690
Yeah, well, at least with him
I get two eyeballs.

11:54.792 --> 11:57.527
- Hey!
- One thousand, please. In advance.

11:57.595 --> 12:01.230
- Where is the trust?
- Where is the money?

12:01.332 --> 12:06.035
- Pam?
- What? Aww, man...

12:06.137 --> 12:09.205
I was saving that for a whole
big girlie treat day for myself.

12:09.307 --> 12:12.174
Go to the beauty parlor,
get a new dress...

12:12.277 --> 12:14.992
No one cares.

12:17.882 --> 12:20.417
- Teeming.
- One for dinner, please.

12:20.418 --> 12:22.585
Und tell the chef I want

12:22.687 --> 12:26.355
the biggest steak in the house,
rare und bloody.

12:26.457 --> 12:30.836
I must replenish my Lebenskraft.

12:30.871 --> 12:33.296
Try not to fall in love.

12:33.398 --> 12:35.098
And you might as well start now,

12:35.133 --> 12:37.133
see if you can get
a free meal out of it.

12:37.235 --> 12:41.103
- You said my board's included!
- Just the continental breakfast, dear.

12:41.205 --> 12:43.139
- Wha...?
- Free bear claws!

12:43.241 --> 12:45.174
- Rrgh!
- Rrowwr!

12:45.276 --> 12:47.776
- Rrrrghh!
- Rrrowwrrr!

12:49.514 --> 12:51.881
Rowr.

12:54.202 --> 12:59.806
So, breadfruit...
What's that about?

12:59.908 --> 13:02.075
Oh, about one kilo, on average.

13:03.245 --> 13:06.213
Zat was a joke.

13:06.281 --> 13:08.699
Hey, are you gonna eat those potatoes

13:08.700 --> 13:11.185
- and stuff or whatever?
- Ja?

13:11.186 --> 13:13.019
Because I should probably
maybe eat something.

13:13.121 --> 13:15.522
- I'm getting kinda drunk.
- Ja.

13:15.624 --> 13:19.993
And sometimes when I'm drunk, 
I can get a little... crazy.

13:20.095 --> 13:22.730
<i>- Ja?
- Jaaa.</i>

13:22.731 --> 13:26.133
So I at least need a haircut...
Care-cut.

13:26.134 --> 13:28.436
- Carrot!
- Oh.

13:28.437 --> 13:34.107
<i>Don't worry liebchen...
I have eine groÃe Karotte for you.</i>

13:34.209 --> 13:38.007
Wow.
How are you still single?

13:39.554 --> 13:41.688
Okay, Crackers,
this is where you come in...

13:41.790 --> 13:43.523
- You see that bathroom window?
- Yep.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.259
I want you to fly in there, and
then meet us at the front door.

13:46.361 --> 13:48.061
Yep!

13:48.964 --> 13:50.697
- And keep it down!
- Yep, yep, yep!

13:50.799 --> 13:51.799
It's like if a...

13:51.800 --> 13:53.000
Wha?

13:53.001 --> 13:54.669
- I'm sorry!
- Goddamn it...

13:54.670 --> 13:58.038
- Sorry! Jesus.
- C'mon, let's go.

14:01.376 --> 14:05.245
- I swear to God...
- And you know they live to be like, eighty.

14:05.347 --> 14:08.054
- How old's he?
- What, 40?

14:08.089 --> 14:09.529
Ugh.

14:09.564 --> 14:10.685
Goddamn it, bird!

14:10.686 --> 14:12.286
<i>Well, who puts that there?!</i>

14:12.287 --> 14:13.955
Are you in position?!

14:13.956 --> 14:15.523
<i>For what?</i>

14:15.524 --> 14:17.224
- To open the door!
- What?

14:17.292 --> 14:20.561
- Open the goddamn door!
- How?

14:20.562 --> 14:23.330
- What do you mean, how?!
- Yeah, what was your plan there?

14:23.365 --> 14:25.065
I don't know, jump on the handle!

14:25.133 --> 14:27.702
- It's a knob!
- Clearly a knob.

14:27.703 --> 14:29.136
Oh, my God.

14:29.137 --> 14:32.572
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Okay, let me think.

14:32.674 --> 14:34.275
What, what if we...

14:34.276 --> 14:36.343
Wh...?!
Would you do that?!

14:36.445 --> 14:37.945
Because we don't have all night!

14:37.946 --> 14:40.982
We also don't want Fuchs to know
somebody broke into his house!

14:40.983 --> 14:43.249
<i>Oh, he's gonna know...</i>

14:43.352 --> 14:45.719
<i>Ãffne deinen
mund, mein leibchen!</i>

14:45.821 --> 14:48.788
<i>Hier kommt
der Zug in den Bahnhof!</i>

14:48.890 --> 14:51.091
Doot dooooot!

14:51.193 --> 14:54.027
And how is everything, Miss Vandertunt?

14:55.797 --> 14:58.198
Wonderful, wonderful.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.233
And would you
and your guest care to enjoy

15:00.335 --> 15:03.336
brandy and cigars
in your room upstairs?

15:03.438 --> 15:07.941
- Grrrr...
- Ja, we will enjoy zis very much.

15:08.043 --> 15:10.443
Doot doot.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.380
Because why are you so mad?!

15:13.382 --> 15:15.582
Because why'd
you shit on the sofa?!

15:15.684 --> 15:17.550
- I was scared!
- Of what?!

15:17.652 --> 15:20.020
How mad you'd be
that I shit on the sofa!

15:20.122 --> 15:21.789
Bird, I swear... Ow!

15:21.790 --> 15:23.324
- What the...?
- What is it?

15:23.325 --> 15:26.626
It happens to be a large
brown suitcase, Pam.

15:26.728 --> 15:28.661
With some kinda spy radio inside.

15:28.764 --> 15:31.131
- Dun dun dunnnnnn!
- Bird?

15:31.233 --> 15:32.666
Knock it off, you licknuts.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.834
And come here, look at all this shit.

15:34.936 --> 15:38.672
- What the...?
- Right? And check this out...

15:38.673 --> 15:41.675
- What's it all mean?
- Beats me, but I'm thinking

15:41.676 --> 15:45.880
- that kraut is into some weird shit.
- Redundant.

15:45.881 --> 15:48.382
<i>Ja, mein liebchen,</i>

15:48.383 --> 15:52.385
<i>und wir tanzen...

15:52.487 --> 15:55.355
<i>Und Gott verdammt
deisen BÃ¼stenhalter!</i>

15:55.457 --> 15:58.459
- Wait, what?
- Und wir tanzen...

15:58.460 --> 16:01.995
And you guys, check this out!

16:02.097 --> 16:03.930
Holy shit!
That's the island!

16:04.032 --> 16:07.400
- Gooosebumps!
- Racist. All birds have bumps.

16:07.502 --> 16:09.269
And look, I
bet that's the idol!

16:09.371 --> 16:11.872
Okay, come on, let's go!

16:11.873 --> 16:13.441
What're you...?
No! We can't take

16:13.442 --> 16:15.076
the map, he'll know he got robbed!

16:15.077 --> 16:17.710
- Ya think?!
- Well, technically burgled, but...

16:17.813 --> 16:19.480
Bird! Pam, copy it!

16:19.481 --> 16:22.048
- The bird?
- The map! Goddamn it!

16:22.150 --> 16:24.217
You copy the map,
we'll clean up all the mess!

16:24.319 --> 16:28.521
- Man, where to start, right? Rrrk!
- Said the feather duster.

16:31.793 --> 16:34.828
<i> Komm schon!
Du doof Schlampe!</i>

16:34.863 --> 16:38.645
<i>Wohl, das wird dich aufwecken!</i>

16:38.680 --> 16:41.234
Son of a...
Knock knock!

16:41.336 --> 16:42.503
<i>Nein, nein!</i>

16:42.504 --> 16:46.673
- Well, what have we here?
- Nothing! What do you want?!

16:46.775 --> 16:49.067
I brought you some more
brandy, but it looks like

16:49.102 --> 16:52.018
your hostess has already
had a bit too much.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.181
- Maybe we should let her sleep.
- She's fine. Get out!

16:55.283 --> 16:56.983
Let's let her sleep.

16:57.018 --> 16:58.285
<i>Gottverdammt, woman!</i>

16:58.286 --> 17:01.721
- Are you deaf, or just stupid?!
- Pick one.

17:01.723 --> 17:03.948
Manu, dear, could I borrow you?

17:03.992 --> 17:05.526
Would you be a little lamb

17:05.527 --> 17:08.528
and show Miss Vandertunt's
guest to the door?

17:08.630 --> 17:11.131
Fine!
Und from now on,

17:11.233 --> 17:15.935
- I will eat die ScheiÃen-Pasta at Luigi's!
- Ugh, Luigi's.

17:16.839 --> 17:20.500
A-ta-ta-taaa...

17:20.535 --> 17:22.942
C'mon... c'mon...

17:23.044 --> 17:24.844
Upsy...daisy!

17:26.047 --> 17:27.414
Ugh.

17:27.415 --> 17:29.849
Do I get my nine dollars now?

17:29.951 --> 17:33.686
- No.
- Doot doot!

17:33.788 --> 17:36.422
I cannot wait to find
that verdammt idol

17:36.525 --> 17:38.758
and get off this ScheiÃe island!

17:38.860 --> 17:41.194
Und why am I speaking English?!

17:41.296 --> 17:42.996
Pam, how's the
map, you almost done?

17:42.998 --> 17:45.899
Hang on...

17:46.001 --> 17:47.701
Yeah, okay, done!

17:48.637 --> 17:53.089
- What the shit?!
- Oh, I know, it just keeps getting worse!

17:53.124 --> 17:54.774
I said blot!
Why didn't you blot?!

17:54.876 --> 17:56.643
Why didn't I sew your asshole shut

17:56.745 --> 17:58.611
like a Christmas goddamn goose?!

17:58.713 --> 18:00.014
- Huh?
- What?

18:00.015 --> 18:01.715
- Is that not how they do it?
- First of all,

18:01.816 --> 18:03.450
I'm pretty sure the asshole is gone,

18:03.451 --> 18:05.285
out of any bird, way before
you start cooking...

18:05.387 --> 18:07.087
<i>Was ist los?</i>

18:07.189 --> 18:09.789
<i>Ach! Das
fenster ist zerbrochen...</i>

18:09.891 --> 18:12.959
- Okay, we're going to Plan B!
- What, no, I hate Plan B!

18:13.061 --> 18:15.395
- Rrrk!
- We're doing. Plan B.

18:15.497 --> 18:17.463
And you better sell it, bird!

18:17.566 --> 18:19.809
Come on, out the back!

18:21.069 --> 18:22.603
<i>Hallo?</i>

18:22.604 --> 18:26.105
Aw, man...
Okay, here it goes...

18:28.777 --> 18:31.745
Oh, man...
Plan B is the best.

18:31.746 --> 18:34.647
<i>Aaaaagh!
Fledermaus, fledermaus!</i>

18:38.527 --> 18:40.861
Excuse me?
Come here, please.

18:40.862 --> 18:42.430
<i>Si, signore?</i>

18:42.431 --> 18:44.464
So, for context,
last night I was attacked

18:44.566 --> 18:47.100
by what I can only assume
was a giant jungle bat,

18:47.202 --> 18:49.369
which did this
to my face, and left me

18:49.471 --> 18:51.671
and my house covered
in blood and shit.

18:51.773 --> 18:53.107
<i>Ah. Terribile...</i>

18:53.108 --> 18:55.408
Ja ja, it was indeed terrible.

18:55.510 --> 19:00.748
But not compared to this breakfast!

19:00.749 --> 19:03.616
And probably not compared
to this goddamn map.

19:03.718 --> 19:07.088
- Aw, c'mon, I was in a hurry.
- To suck?

19:07.089 --> 19:08.556
I'll tell you what sucks...

19:08.557 --> 19:11.424
Ooh.
Being mistaken for a bat.

19:11.526 --> 19:15.729
Ooh.
But not as much as that map.
