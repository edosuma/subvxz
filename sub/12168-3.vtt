00:01.919 --> 00:03.378
You know,

00:03.545 --> 00:06.757
when they told me
I'd be travelling to another galaxy,

00:06.798 --> 00:09.593
visiting strange new worlds,

00:09.885 --> 00:12.971
defending humanity against
unimaginable alien threats,

00:13.055 --> 00:15.140
this just is not

00:15.224 --> 00:16.725
what I pictured!

00:16.808 --> 00:18.936
We could be saving Earth...

00:18.977 --> 00:22.523
- right here, right now, Major.
- Oh yeah? How's that?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.816
Through a greater understanding

00:24.900 --> 00:30.155
of the long-term effects of
severe ozone depletion on plant life.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.950
You may not
want to admit it, but it's a real danger.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.202
Oh yeah! Sure!

00:35.285 --> 00:38.121
Global warming... Wraith attack.

00:38.247 --> 00:41.333
I see the similarity
now, you're right! Yeah, it's great!

00:41.458 --> 00:43.126
Hey, not too far Doc, OK?

00:43.168 --> 00:44.837
Ah, not to worry, Major.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.673
I don't think there's
much chance any animal could survive

00:47.714 --> 00:51.009
the long-term effects
of exposure to the sunlight on this planet.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.554
So not a place to build a summer home?

00:54.429 --> 00:59.184
It's the fact this vegetation is thriving!

00:59.309 --> 01:01.895
Somehow it's managed to persist

01:01.937 --> 01:06.400
despite what should
be extremely destructive ionising radiation.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.611
Oh, would you look at that!

01:10.487 --> 01:15.492
Now what is a
williamsonia suardiana doing here?

Major!

01:38.932 --> 01:41.101
Doesn't look like the sun killed him.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.686
<i>What do we do?</i>

01:45.314 --> 01:47.608
Kaufman, this is Lorne... any activity?

01:47.649 --> 01:48.859
<i>No, Sir.</i>

01:48.901 --> 01:52.196
We got a dead sucker here...
looks KIA, no more than a day old.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.947
We're on our way.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.949
Come on, Doc,

01:56.033 --> 01:58.660
- let's get you back to the Gate.
- I... I don't understand.

01:58.744 --> 01:59.786
Well, neither do I.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.290
All I know is he didn't do
that to himself. Come on, let's go.

<i>- Is the Gate covered?</i>
<i>- Kaufman and Reed, yeah.</i>

02:32.569 --> 02:35.197
We found a dead Wraith. Shot several times.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.867
Looked like bullets,
but it's hard to say. The guy was a mess.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.452
The Genii have such weapons.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.205
Doctor Beckett is performing an autopsy.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.668
- Here he is now.
- I'm not done... not nearly,

02:47.709 --> 02:49.378
but I thought you might like to know this.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.047
The enzyme sac
under the right arm has been removed.

02:52.965 --> 02:53.841
Ford!

02:56.844 --> 02:58.053
What's going on?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.888
Thanks for coming, Rodney.

03:00.556 --> 03:01.515
What? I was right in the middle of a...

03:01.557 --> 03:04.142
<i>P3M-736. We found a dead Wraith,</i>

03:04.685 --> 03:07.938
- maybe killed by Ford.
- He could still be there.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.357
Whoa, wait a second. 736?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.985
The UV index there
during the day is something like a thousand.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.737
Bring your sunscreen.
Be ready in ten minutes.

03:18.365 --> 03:22.286
What? I wanna
get Ford back just as much as everyone
else, but do you see my complexion?

03:22.369 --> 03:25.289
- Yes.
- Yes, it's very fair!

03:26.123 --> 03:27.833
Extremely fair.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.880
This isn't fair.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.717
Colonel!

03:37.301 --> 03:38.218
Colonel.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.761
Something urgent?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.681
- We think we have a bead on Ford.
- So I heard.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.932
That was fast.

03:43.974 --> 03:49.688
Base protocol
dictates all senior officers be notified of
situations Code Orange and above. Hey!

03:50.147 --> 03:53.525
How does that go again?
Red, Orange, Blue or the other way around?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.986
- You mind if we go over that when I get back?
- Colonel!

03:56.028 --> 03:58.822
You don't have to remind me of our respective
positions or that you outrank me, Sir.

03:58.864 --> 04:02.618
I was wondering if I needed to remind you
that Lieutenant Ford is a significant
threat to the security of this base.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.827
He's also a friend in need.

04:03.869 --> 04:07.247
His condition forces him to seek out the Wraith.
If he's caught, he would compromise...

04:07.247 --> 04:08.790
Look, I'm gonna find him,

04:08.790 --> 04:11.043
- and I'm gonna bring him back.
- According to Doctor Beckett's report,

04:11.084 --> 04:13.921
there may not be anything
that can be done to help him.

04:17.966 --> 04:22.053
With all due respect, Sir, I hope you're
not saying what I think you're saying.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.892
Lieutenant Ford has already proven resourceful
enough to penetrate security and escape the city.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.812
I'm saying if you encounter him and there's
any chance whatsoever that his capture

04:30.854 --> 04:35.651
might prove elusive,
you are duty bound to eliminate the threat.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.238
Lieutenant Ford may have been your friend,

04:39.321 --> 04:41.240
but he's not any more.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.743
I know you understand...
you'll do what's right.

04:45.244 --> 04:49.331
You didn't seem to have a problem with
mercy when it came to Colonel Sumner.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.086
Dismissed.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.122
- Lifesigns detector's useless.
- I told you so.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.958
Just preserving your streak of being right,
officially?

05:33.000 --> 05:37.087
Doctor Parrish believes
that the indigenous plant life retains enough

05:37.129 --> 05:40.090
residual radioactivity
absorbed during the daylight to,

05:40.174 --> 05:41.842
well, to screw up our sensors.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.678
- Making it the perfect place to hide.
- Yes...

05:45.012 --> 05:50.017
or... the perfect place to be exposed to
dangerously high levels of solar radiation!

05:50.726 --> 05:54.104
- Any activity while we were gone?
- No, Sir.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.690
Start a sweep... teams of two.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.527
Radio contact every twenty minutes.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.446
It smells like I'm on vacation.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.490
Could it be the
simulated tropical aroma of cocoa butter?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.035
Strong enough
for anyone within five miles to smell you.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.829
Like they haven't
been tipped off by the Aqua Velva.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.164
It's dark.

06:12.456 --> 06:16.043
Yeah, and the sun will be
up in two hours, forty three minutes and...

06:16.168 --> 06:18.295
- ten seconds.
- It's raining!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.547
So we'll be cold and miserable.

06:20.589 --> 06:26.094
Look, the cloud cover will depreciate
a small percentage of UV rays,
but ninety-five percent of deadly is still deadly.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.889
Doctor Parrish said a
day or two of exposure wasn't gonna kill us.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.100
Oh yes,
and Doctor Parrish has a PhD in what?

06:32.184 --> 06:33.435
Right... botany!

06:33.519 --> 06:34.561
Teyla, you're with me.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.147
Kaufman take Villick,
Reed and Sherman cover the gate...

06:37.189 --> 06:39.566
and Major you've got McKay.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.362
- Oh, lucky me!
- Here, try some. SPF 100.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.739
- A hundred?
- Yeah, can't buy this kind of protection.
Make it myself.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.491
- Waterproof too.
- Great.

07:02.047 --> 07:06.134
You have any idea what a lone Wraith
would be doing out here on foot?

07:06.176 --> 07:08.053
No, it is unusual.

07:08.178 --> 07:12.057
Perhaps Lieutenant
Ford was able to lure him through the Gate.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.777
It looks as if someone
might have headed off in this direction.

07:27.573 --> 07:28.949
So exactly...

07:28.949 --> 07:30.200
what kind of...

07:30.284 --> 07:32.661
special training do you guys have
to go through to get this sort of mission?

07:32.703 --> 07:35.455
- You guys ?
- Yeah, you know...

07:35.622 --> 07:38.625
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines...
it's a great place to start!

07:38.709 --> 07:41.003
And by `this mission'
you mean hunting down a skilled weapons

07:41.044 --> 07:44.965
expert hopped up on Wraith drugs
in the pitch black of an alien planet?

07:45.007 --> 07:47.467
- Yes!
- Actually,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.720
I skipped that course in Major school.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.096
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.725
I was hoping Lieutenant
Ford might recognise a friendly face

07:54.725 --> 07:57.394
- and just turn himself in.
- What, you mean me?!

07:58.061 --> 07:59.771
Well, you were friends, weren't you?

07:59.813 --> 08:03.650
Oh, yeah! When we
weren't out on harrowing missions, we
used to hang out together. I'd share my...

08:03.650 --> 08:05.903
dreams of a self-sustaining fusion and he...

08:05.944 --> 08:09.114
he would talk of how
you could sever a man's torso with a P-90!

08:09.156 --> 08:13.076
- What... that means quiet, right?
- Yeah... get down, get down!

08:14.161 --> 08:14.912
What?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.539
I thought I saw something move.

08:23.629 --> 08:24.880
What is it?

08:24.963 --> 08:27.007
I heard something.

08:28.634 --> 08:29.718
Ford?

08:30.552 --> 08:32.513
Is that you? It's John.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.351
Aiden, listen to me.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.686
We wanna help you, please!

08:39.937 --> 08:42.397
Just come out... we only wanna talk.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.283
What?

08:53.492 --> 08:55.285
Say something!

08:55.911 --> 08:56.870
What?

08:56.912 --> 08:58.664
Talk to him!

08:58.830 --> 09:00.999
What if it's not him?

09:02.459 --> 09:03.752
Ford?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.004
You there?

09:06.630 --> 09:07.965
It's your...

09:07.965 --> 09:10.592
best friend Rodney, Rodney Mc Kay.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.887
Everyone misses you back in Atlantis,

09:13.929 --> 09:17.808
and Doctor Beckett's figured out a way to help you,
so you've just gotta trust me and...

09:23.438 --> 09:26.358
Colonel Sheppard, it's Major Lorne.
In pursuit of suspect.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.276
What?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.319
So are we. Where are you?

09:29.361 --> 09:31.029
We're two klicks south of the Stargate.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.197
Where are you?

09:41.915 --> 09:42.958
What is it?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.043
Lost him.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.880
Colonel Sheppard.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.299
Stand by. Teyla's been hit.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.517
Colonel Sheppard,
say again. What's your position?

10:02.603 --> 10:05.480
Colonel Sheppard, please respond.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.322
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

10:13.906 --> 10:15.741
<i>Come in please.</i>

10:16.158 --> 10:17.701
<i>Colonel Sheppard.</i>

10:19.786 --> 10:23.874
<i>We haven't heard from them</i>
<i>since 26:30 Atlantis Standard Time.</i>

10:23.957 --> 10:28.795
I know the lifesigns detector
doesn't work there, Major, but
can you use the Jumper to search from the air?

10:28.837 --> 10:31.840
No, ma'am,
the foliage is far too dense for that.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.675
I'll send another team to assist.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.802
Well, anyone you could spare would be great.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.554
<i>Anything else you need?</i>

10:37.596 --> 10:40.390
Elizabeth,
it's Rodney. Yes, hi. There are...

10:40.432 --> 10:44.478
four class one radiation suits
in Medlab storage. We'll need them all.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.355
What?

10:46.438 --> 10:49.983
Look, I know there's not
enough for us all, but we can take turns.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.985
Any sign of Lieutenant Ford yet?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.112
<i>No, ma'am, not that we can confirm.</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:57.407
<i>Fact is, we don't even know if</i>
<i>this is Lieutenant Ford we're dealing with.</i>

11:30.858 --> 11:32.109
Ford?

11:41.535 --> 11:42.619
Colonel?

11:42.703 --> 11:44.288
You OK?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.790
My head is pounding.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.625
Where are we?

11:48.667 --> 11:52.629
I don't know,
but I was just about to ask him.

11:59.261 --> 12:02.181
You might wanna
be careful where you point that thing.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.850
Looks like you've got the safety off.

12:09.980 --> 12:10.814
OK,

12:11.190 --> 12:12.691
be that way.

12:13.108 --> 12:19.615
But my guess is if you wanted us dead, we'd
be dead right now, so why don't you tell
us who you are and what you want.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.160
Alright, I'll go first.

12:23.869 --> 12:26.830
I'm Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.541
I am Teyla Emmagan.

12:30.626 --> 12:34.755
- Colonel ?
- It's my rank... military designation.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.300
Specialist Ronon Dex.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.803
- That's you ?
- Name and rank.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.477
Military?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.982
I used to be.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.291
It was a long time ago.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.253
And now?

13:16.672 --> 13:19.967
Now I'm deciding
whether to kill you and your friends.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.060
OK, listen up.

13:30.060 --> 13:35.524
I want regular radio contact.
Report anything unusual...
and I'm talking anything unusual at all.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.608
Alright, move out.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.486
Wait, aren't any of them gonna...

13:39.695 --> 13:42.322
Forget it. That's just reckless!

13:42.906 --> 13:44.491
There are four suits.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.452
Not exactly designed for moving
through dense brush and rough terrain,

13:47.452 --> 13:50.122
- not to mention possible combat.
- No,

13:50.289 --> 13:55.711
but by my calculations we've been exposed
to 327 millisieverts since the sun came up.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.504
It may not sound like much to you but,

13:57.546 --> 14:01.175
I've been keeping a running
tally of my lifetime exposure to radiation:

14:01.175 --> 14:06.597
X-rays, cellphones, plane rides,
that whole unfortunate Genii nuclear reactor thing.

14:06.638 --> 14:10.642
My God ... last week we flew
dangerously close to the corona of a sun!

14:10.684 --> 14:13.187
As it is, I may have to forego reproducing.

14:13.270 --> 14:14.938
Yeah, that's funny...

14:15.230 --> 14:17.774
I was just thinkin' that might be wise.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.370
Look,

14:30.454 --> 14:35.751
the men guarding the Stargate are
highly-trained soldiers armed with deadly weapons.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.752
Stargate?

14:36.960 --> 14:39.755
Stargate, big circle thing.

14:40.214 --> 14:43.008
I've always known it as the Ring of the Ancestors.

14:43.342 --> 14:46.220
No matter... I have to make it through.

14:47.346 --> 14:52.935
Look, we didn't come here looking for trouble,
and the whole killing thing is really unnecessary.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.019
If your friends try to stop me...

14:54.061 --> 14:56.313
They won't, if I tell them not to.

14:57.981 --> 15:03.403
Untie us, we'll all go to the Gate together
and you can be on your way.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.656
But why should I trust you?

15:07.991 --> 15:09.451
That's a good question.

15:10.494 --> 15:13.622
Teyla... why should he trust us?

15:15.082 --> 15:18.627
We mean you no harm.
We are only here searching for a friend.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.064
Drop it!

16:21.815 --> 16:24.526
I saw him... your friend.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.446
Where? When?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.740
He killed the Wraith that was hunting me.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.242
Hunting you?

16:34.745 --> 16:35.996
Why are you looking for him?

16:36.038 --> 16:40.167
His name is Aiden Ford and he is sick.
He needs our help.

16:44.463 --> 16:48.509
Thought he'd been in the sun too long.
It can make you sick here.

16:49.551 --> 16:55.057
We know that, and that may be true,
but that's not all that's wrong with him.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.059
Then why is he running from you?

16:57.309 --> 16:58.852
Well, he's not, exactly.

16:59.978 --> 17:03.941
Then what is he doing... exactly?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.277
It's complicated.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.570
You can do better than that.

17:15.827 --> 17:22.084
Colonel Sheppard? Teyla?
This is Major Lorne, do you read?

17:23.544 --> 17:24.545
It's so hot!

17:24.586 --> 17:27.923
Oh, come on... step it up OK, would you?

17:28.089 --> 17:32.511
I am moving as fast as I can.
I'm very hot. Aren't you hot?

17:32.553 --> 17:37.516
Actually, I'm quite comfortable...
but I'm not wearing a fifty pound rubber suit, am I?

17:37.558 --> 17:39.476
I can't breathe! I gotta stop!

17:43.981 --> 17:45.649
Sweet relief!

17:47.317 --> 17:56.076
I think the... the fumes from the sunblock are making
me dizzy. I gotta... I gotta... just... rest here.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.498
Unbelievable!

18:01.540 --> 18:03.750
The Wraith was feeding on him.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.129
Apparently they inject some sort
of drug into you when they feed.

18:16.305 --> 18:20.392
He killed the Wraith, got an overdose of the drug.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.686
Kinda messed with him up.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.480
But we think we can help him if we can find him.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.320
What is that?

18:31.361 --> 18:32.613
Radios.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.573
Communication devices.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.576
Our people are trying to contact us.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.662
The cave must be causing
some interference with the signal.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.586
What the hell are you doing?

18:48.629 --> 18:50.088
Getting my hand free.

18:50.923 --> 18:52.174
Didn't feel that way!

18:55.093 --> 18:57.387
OK, you've had your fresh air.
Come on, let's go.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.473
Well, shouldn't we be headed back?
It must have been half an hour.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.183
It's been fifteen minutes.

19:01.225 --> 19:04.269
Oh, really? I thought... It feels longer.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.397
Wow... you must really be some kind of genius!

19:07.814 --> 19:13.237
Well, as a matter of fact, I, um... wait a minute.
See, why would you say that now?

19:13.278 --> 19:16.490
Something has to have kept Colonel Sheppard
from shooting you all this time!

19:16.532 --> 19:18.450
Yeah, yeah, OK, I didn't see that one coming!

19:21.995 --> 19:24.623
Mayday! Mayday! We are under attack!

19:24.706 --> 19:27.626
Lorne has been hit! I repeat...
we are under Wraith attack!

19:30.337 --> 19:31.588
Will you relax, McKay?

19:33.257 --> 19:34.091
Ford!

19:34.091 --> 19:35.467
Why don't you drop your gun?

19:35.509 --> 19:39.304
I know what you're like with weapons...I wouldn't want
it accidentally going off while it's pointed at me.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.309
Right!

19:46.603 --> 19:48.897
Good. Now you and me can catch up.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.656
<i>Doctor McKay, what is your position?</i>

19:57.698 --> 20:00.492
<i>Please respond. Major Lorne, come in?</i>

20:03.704 --> 20:04.538
Let's go.

20:05.998 --> 20:07.249
We can't leave Major Lorne.

20:07.875 --> 20:08.917
He'll be fine.

20:09.543 --> 20:10.586
No...

20:16.216 --> 20:18.927
You know that the sunlight
on this planet is kinda dangerous?

20:18.927 --> 20:19.970
Not for me.

20:20.012 --> 20:20.804
Actually, if you...

20:20.846 --> 20:23.473
Listen, McKay... you guys
all think I'm crazy or something.

20:23.515 --> 20:24.558
No... no-one thinks that.

20:24.600 --> 20:28.645
Sure. Here's the thing: I'm not just fine,
I'm better than fine.

20:29.354 --> 20:32.107
Really. This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.776
Well, good! Good for you!

20:34.818 --> 20:37.362
I can prove it.
You just have to give me the chance to prove it.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.782
Well, sure.
Let's... let's head back to the Jumper...

20:40.824 --> 20:43.285
No way. First I'm gonna prove to you that I'm OK,

20:43.327 --> 20:47.706
that things are better this way, then you can go back
and tell the others and then they'll let me come back.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.167
You can come back to Atlantis right now.
Doctor Beckett is...

20:50.209 --> 20:52.920
No. First we have to save Major Sheppard and Teyla.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.214
You know where they are?

20:55.297 --> 20:56.131
Yeah.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.551
Which way did you...?

21:02.513 --> 21:04.806
So obviously
the Wraith didn't destroy Atlantis.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.892
Anything else happen since I've been gone?

21:07.059 --> 21:09.978
Major Sheppard got
promoted to Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

21:10.103 --> 21:10.812
Really?

21:10.938 --> 21:13.023
- Yeah.
- Good for him!

21:13.732 --> 21:14.775
Yeah.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.868
Keep your hands where I can see them.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.379
- I told you, I have to get to the Ring.
- Why?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.172
- Because the Wraith are coming.
- How do you know?

21:37.214 --> 21:39.049
I know. They're hunting me.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.801
Join the club.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.804
You are a Runner.

21:46.515 --> 21:48.475
I have heard stories, but...

21:48.517 --> 21:50.102
What's a Runner?

21:52.980 --> 21:55.732
I was captured
during a culling on my planet.

21:55.816 --> 21:57.484
I was taken to a ship.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.403
A Wraith started to feed on me.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.576
Something made him stop.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.344
They operated on me...

22:24.428 --> 22:25.888
put some sort of

22:25.929 --> 22:28.599
tracking device in my back and released me.

22:34.688 --> 22:35.939
They hunted me.

22:42.863 --> 22:44.531
I hunted them back.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.618
I've been running ever since.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.453
Don't do it.

22:49.953 --> 22:52.748
Like I said, we're not here to get in your way.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.459
That's good.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.552
You're lucky I had that set to stun.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.933
<i>- You sure this is the right way?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm sure. Keep moving.</i>

23:10.974 --> 23:12.643
<i>- You say this guy has them.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

23:12.684 --> 23:13.769
What guy?

23:13.810 --> 23:16.396
I don't know!
...'what guy?' A guy!

23:16.563 --> 23:18.607
Look, I was on a Wraith planet...

23:18.857 --> 23:21.985
P3X... P3X-447?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.196
447... I know the address.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.739
And there were Wraith there?

23:25.781 --> 23:28.617
Yeah. A whole hive ship.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.118
Anyway,

23:30.160 --> 23:32.996
I was scouting the place out, looking
for the best way in so I could kill a couple.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.790
- What, for the enzyme?
- Exactly.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.251
McKay, I'm telling you,
it's the key to defeating them!

23:37.292 --> 23:39.545
We could create
a whole army of supermen like me!

23:39.586 --> 23:40.712
You were saying?

23:40.754 --> 23:42.464
- What?
- About the guy.

23:42.881 --> 23:43.924
Right.

23:44.007 --> 23:46.093
So this one Wraith, armed to the teeth,

23:46.176 --> 23:48.178
comes walking towards the Gate.

23:48.554 --> 23:51.390
I figure
one Wraith by himself is easy pickings,

23:51.431 --> 23:53.725
so I followed him here to this planet.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.602
Anyway, I think he was looking for the guy.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.104
How do you know?

24:02.526 --> 24:05.279
Well, he was running
from the Wraith when I killed the sucker.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.363
OK,

24:06.405 --> 24:09.157
so what does
the guy want with Sheppard and Teyla?

24:09.199 --> 24:10.450
I don't know.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.828
When I save them, I'll find out!

24:16.290 --> 24:17.291
Look,

24:17.875 --> 24:20.127
you wanna go through the Gate, go.

24:20.711 --> 24:23.463
Give me my radio,
I'll order my men not to stop you.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.341
You can tell them in person.
I'm taking you with me.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.969
You know,
there's a chance we could help you.

24:29.011 --> 24:29.928
How?

24:29.970 --> 24:33.265
We know a pretty good doctor... maybe he
could take that tracking device out of you.

24:33.307 --> 24:34.933
You think I haven't tried?

24:36.393 --> 24:37.936
Suit yourself.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.151
And why would you do that?

24:44.193 --> 24:47.738
Because I'm a nice guy. Look, I told you.

24:47.779 --> 24:54.161
You hate the Wraith, we hate the Wraith.
It's something we all have in common.
We just want our friend back.

24:56.163 --> 24:58.081
You get this tracking device out of me...

24:58.123 --> 24:59.875
I'll get your friend back for you.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.002
OK, good.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.004
It's a deal.

25:14.848 --> 25:15.682
Major.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.147
- Where's Lorne?
- He's inside, Sir.

25:22.189 --> 25:23.273
What happened to you?

25:23.315 --> 25:25.817
I got hit by a Wraith blaster looking for you.

25:25.901 --> 25:28.278
- Now McKay's missing.
- Great!

25:28.362 --> 25:29.613
What about Teyla?

25:29.863 --> 25:33.492
Long story.
You can listen to it while I tell Doctor Weir.

25:36.537 --> 25:37.913
This is a joke, right?

25:37.955 --> 25:39.248
I'm afraid not.

25:39.331 --> 25:43.585
You want me to go to an alien planet and perform
surgery on an armed man holding Teyla hostage?

25:43.627 --> 25:45.128
Yeah, something like that.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.089
And apparently you don't have much time.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.174
The Wraith could show up at any minute.

25:49.842 --> 25:52.344
Oh! It's getting better all the time!

25:52.511 --> 25:54.513
Have they found Lieutenant Ford yet?

25:54.555 --> 25:55.597
No.

25:55.973 --> 25:58.183
I haven't told you about McKay yet either.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.310
Come on, pack up what you need.

26:01.270 --> 26:05.190
I don't think an operating room
and a bloody army will fit through the Gate.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.615
Why are you stopping?

26:13.657 --> 26:17.244
Because I am tired,
and you have no idea where you're going.

26:18.203 --> 26:19.246
How do you know?

26:19.288 --> 26:21.373
We've been walking around in circles for hours!

26:21.415 --> 26:22.875
So that's it...

26:22.916 --> 26:24.209
you just give up, is that it?

26:24.251 --> 26:27.588
That's what you do, isn't it... you just give up
on your friends when they need you most!

26:27.629 --> 26:29.506
No-one's given up on you, Ford! We wanna help you!

26:29.548 --> 26:32.092
I'm talking about Major Sheppard and Teyla.

26:32.134 --> 26:33.135
Lieutenant Colonel Sheppard.

26:33.177 --> 26:36.221
Alright... Lieutenant Colonel.
So Ford's lost it, Ford's all crazy,

26:36.221 --> 26:38.473
Fool Ford can't even remember a simple little thing.

26:38.515 --> 26:39.600
Hey, I never said that!

26:39.641 --> 26:43.145
Although the fact that you keep referring to yourself in
the third person does indicate clinical dissociation.

26:43.187 --> 26:45.439
You don't even know what a friend is, do you McKay?

26:45.439 --> 26:47.065
All you care about is yourself.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.651
- Will you relax?
- You relax! You're pathetic.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.446
You were always making fun of me.
You wanna play a game? Pick on Ford.

26:52.446 --> 26:53.739
I could shoot you and leave you here to die.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.033
Shoot me? When did this
escalate to physical violence?

26:56.074 --> 26:57.451
You're the one who thinks I'm nuts!

26:57.492 --> 27:00.162
I'm capable of anything...
I could go off at any time.

27:00.204 --> 27:01.413
Alright, you wanna shoot me,

27:01.455 --> 27:04.791
shoot me! Fine! I don't care.
It'll just save me suffering one
of the many horribly painful deaths

27:04.791 --> 27:07.377
I have in line after from
being exposed to this much radiation!

27:07.377 --> 27:09.755
And, quite frankly,
it'll prove just how far gone you are!

27:09.796 --> 27:13.759
Now, I'm heading back to the Jumper
and you're welcome to join me.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.972
Are you crazy? You could have killed me!

27:19.181 --> 27:20.974
I'm sorry.

27:24.311 --> 27:28.982
Look, you don't know what it's like,
almost dying like I did, having
your friends turn on you, no-one trusts you.

27:29.024 --> 27:31.443
I'm out here all alone.

27:31.485 --> 27:33.779
You don't have to be alone, Ford.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.615
Look, this drug is messing with your head.

27:36.657 --> 27:39.743
Come back to the Jumper with me,
we'll go back to Atlantis,

27:39.868 --> 27:44.164
and Dr. Beckett may even be able to figure out a way
for you to keep all your new super-powers...

27:44.957 --> 27:46.500
You think?

27:46.750 --> 27:49.127
Sure, why not?

27:50.379 --> 27:51.839
First we've gotta save Colonel Sheppard and Teyla.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.842
- No, no, wait.
- No! That'll prove that I'm OK.

27:54.883 --> 27:56.176
You go back to the Jumper,

27:56.218 --> 27:57.052
I'll meet you there.

27:57.094 --> 28:00.222
Ford! No!

28:03.809 --> 28:07.271
This is not necessary, you know.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.402
How long have you been on the run?

28:13.986 --> 28:15.946
Seven years.

28:15.988 --> 28:18.490
And you have been on your own all that time?

28:18.532 --> 28:20.242
Not much choice.

28:20.784 --> 28:25.205
Afraid of bringing the Wraith
down on anyone you were with?

28:25.831 --> 28:27.457
Can't go home.

28:27.499 --> 28:30.627
Can't stay in one place for too long.

28:33.755 --> 28:36.216
Why do you think they do it?

28:36.258 --> 28:37.801
I don't know.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.053
Sport,

28:40.429 --> 28:42.472
training,

28:42.973 --> 28:45.225
learn how we fight,

28:45.809 --> 28:48.520
measure our will to survive.

28:48.979 --> 28:50.480
You said

28:51.815 --> 28:53.567
you heard stories,

28:53.609 --> 28:54.568
about others like me?

28:54.568 --> 28:57.237
Yes. I have heard of Runners my whole life,

28:57.279 --> 28:58.989
but I've never met one.

28:59.031 --> 29:01.950
I did not even believe it was true.

29:01.992 --> 29:08.373
One time I accidentally came across
a planet with a village near the Ring.

29:08.415 --> 29:09.166
What happened?

29:09.208 --> 29:12.294
I stayed... one night...

29:12.586 --> 29:14.838
had a real meal for a change.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.257
<i>I flied away the next day.</i>

29:17.508 --> 29:19.551
Didn't matter.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.179
I later heard...

29:22.930 --> 29:26.225
the whole village...

29:28.519 --> 29:31.647
Teyla, this is Sheppard, come in?

29:38.195 --> 29:39.655
Go ahead, Colonel.

29:39.655 --> 29:40.489
You OK?

29:40.531 --> 29:42.241
Yes. We are fine.

29:42.282 --> 29:45.035
I'm here with Doctor Beckett. He's coming in.

29:45.077 --> 29:47.037
Unarmed.

29:47.412 --> 29:52.751
Ronon would like me to remind you
that Doctor Beckett remain unarmed.

29:57.381 --> 29:59.466
Alright, for what it's worth,

29:59.508 --> 30:03.387
I'd never send you in there
if I thought the guy was gonna hurt you.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.931
Is that opinion based on some sort of evidence,

30:05.973 --> 30:08.642
or is it just a gut feeling
that this gentleman isn't dangerous?

30:08.684 --> 30:10.978
I didn't say he wasn't dangerous.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.522
He could probably kill you in the blink of an eye.

30:13.564 --> 30:15.440
I don't think he will.

30:15.482 --> 30:18.193
Well thank you, I feel much better now!

30:18.402 --> 30:20.737
You ever heard of Androcles and the Lion?

30:20.737 --> 30:25.033
Aye... and who are you in this retelling? The Romans?

30:25.242 --> 30:27.744
I'll be right up there.

30:40.174 --> 30:41.258
Hello.

30:42.176 --> 30:46.805
I normally don't make house calls like this,
but then again this isn't really a house, is it?

30:46.847 --> 30:48.348
What's in the case, Doc?

30:48.348 --> 30:53.145
Surgical implements, diagnostic tools,
various drugs, analgesics, antibiotics.

30:53.187 --> 30:54.104
What?

30:55.022 --> 30:59.443
Ronon, Doctor Carson Beckett.
Doctor Beckett, Ronon.

30:59.484 --> 31:00.694
Pleasure.

31:00.694 --> 31:04.114
I understand you have some sort
of a transmitter in your back.

31:04.323 --> 31:08.118
Well, have a seat.
Off with your shirt, and let's have a look.

31:10.787 --> 31:12.706
A little help.

31:29.431 --> 31:31.391
My God!

31:31.433 --> 31:33.644
Tell me you didn't try
to cut this thing out yourself.

31:33.685 --> 31:37.022
Yeah, I tried once with a mirror.
Couldn't quite reach.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.149
Most of it's from two different doctors.

31:39.191 --> 31:41.902
No-one I know who calls
himself a doctor would do this.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.836
Is that Ancestor technology?

32:00.128 --> 32:02.130
That it is.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.762
Son, you're gonna have to put
that weapon down and lie down.

32:08.804 --> 32:09.930
Not a chance.

32:09.972 --> 32:11.348
Now you listen to me.

32:11.348 --> 32:12.975
I've located the transmitter.

32:13.016 --> 32:15.394
It's in the soft tissue next to
the second thoracic vertebrae.

32:15.394 --> 32:16.436
Good, cut it out.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.438
I can't do that with you sitting up like this,

32:18.480 --> 32:20.482
and I'm gonna have to give you
some anaesthetic to make you sleep.

32:20.524 --> 32:21.525
No you're not.

32:21.567 --> 32:22.568
Excuse me?

32:22.568 --> 32:23.902
Ronon, you need to trust us.

32:23.944 --> 32:29.157
I do. That's why he's here and you're still alive.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.535
Now get to work, Doc.

32:34.788 --> 32:38.208
Look, if you'd just turn on your radio,
we could hear what's happening.

32:38.250 --> 32:41.295
The others must have called for back-up by now.

32:41.295 --> 32:45.090
Maybe Sheppard and Teyla
don't even need rescuing any more.

32:50.888 --> 32:52.306
Someone's coming.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.600
What do I need this for?

33:01.523 --> 33:03.567
OK, I'm ready.

33:03.609 --> 33:06.445
Look, I just wanna say one last time,
I really don't think this is a good idea.

33:06.486 --> 33:09.239
I'm gonna be cutting very close to your
spinal column here. If you were to flinch...

33:09.281 --> 33:10.741
I won't flinch.

33:13.452 --> 33:14.703
OK.

33:16.622 --> 33:18.373
Here we go.

33:51.323 --> 33:53.408
I think I've got it.

34:23.397 --> 34:24.982
<i>Don't shoot! It's just me!</i>

34:31.321 --> 34:32.906
What the hell are you doing, McKay?

34:32.947 --> 34:34.783
What the hell am I doing?
What the hell are you doing!

34:34.824 --> 34:37.159
Those are our guys!

34:38.078 --> 34:39.329
You can't trust them!

34:39.371 --> 34:41.873
Oh, that's it... Yeah I've had it.

34:41.915 --> 34:44.208
Just drop your weapons now!

34:46.210 --> 34:47.838
You're gonna shoot me?!

34:47.838 --> 34:49.380
I will if I have to.

34:49.422 --> 34:52.050
Ford, I'm taking you in.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.803
Look, you may not believe this,
but it's for your own good.

35:08.901 --> 35:10.360
Oh no!

35:17.618 --> 35:20.579
I'm quite certain I've disabled the device.

35:22.706 --> 35:24.124
It may be too late.

35:24.166 --> 35:27.461
We know at least one Wraith tracked Ronon here.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.087
I'm gonna look for McKay and Ford.

35:29.129 --> 35:30.672
Yes... we will be fine.

35:30.714 --> 35:32.674
Now that the lion's passed out cold.

35:32.716 --> 35:35.052
I'm gonna pick you up with the Jumper as soon as...

35:38.931 --> 35:41.725
Help me! Help me!

35:46.355 --> 35:48.398
<i> Sir! Gate activity over here!</i>

35:48.398 --> 35:50.067
Cloak the Jumper, now!

35:55.489 --> 35:57.783
Colonel Sheppard, we've got Gate activity.

36:03.455 --> 36:05.707
<i>Three Wraith Darts just came through.</i>

36:05.749 --> 36:06.750
Great!

36:06.959 --> 36:09.044
We should head back inside.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.348
He went through there.

36:29.731 --> 36:33.026
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

36:36.154 --> 36:38.490
<i>Colonel, Ronon is gone.</i>

36:38.532 --> 36:40.284
<i>There was another way out of the cave.</i>

36:40.325 --> 36:42.202
Get back to the Jumper!

36:47.082 --> 36:48.584
Well, look at you!

36:48.625 --> 36:52.921
Yes... look at me! It's funny, huh?

36:53.255 --> 36:56.300
- You set this up? It's clever.
- It wasn't me.

36:56.341 --> 36:59.511
No, huh? Well, I'm glad we could both, uh,

37:00.137 --> 37:02.639
still laugh about this together.

37:04.474 --> 37:06.393
How about cutting me down now?

37:06.560 --> 37:08.896
No. I think I'm still gonna kill you.

37:08.896 --> 37:11.815
- What?What do you mean, 'still'?
- When did this escalate to killing?

37:11.815 --> 37:12.524
When you shot me.

37:12.566 --> 37:15.360
It's a flesh wound! I knew it wasn't gonna hurt

37:15.402 --> 37:16.820
you... you're, you're SuperFord, remember?!

37:16.862 --> 37:18.322
You tried to kill me!

37:18.363 --> 37:20.073
Wait, hey!

37:20.115 --> 37:24.953
You... you can't kill an unarmed upside down man!

38:22.594 --> 38:23.762
Lieutenant!

38:26.348 --> 38:27.349
Don't.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.109
Ford!

38:43.740 --> 38:48.453
Hi! Doctor Rodney McKay. Could you, um,

38:48.453 --> 38:49.830
get me down please?

39:00.340 --> 39:01.508
Ford!

39:03.719 --> 39:05.762
Keep your hands where I can see them.

39:08.390 --> 39:10.267
We wanna help.

39:23.614 --> 39:26.033
You're not getting off this planet!

39:30.454 --> 39:32.206
I'll show you.

39:35.584 --> 39:37.377
You'll see!

39:49.264 --> 39:52.184
After they scooped up Ford,
the Darts made a beeline for the Gate.

39:52.226 --> 39:53.769
We tried to stop them, but...

39:53.810 --> 39:56.688
You had him in your sights,
and you let him get away.

39:56.897 --> 39:59.483
I shot him once. Didn't slow him down.

39:59.525 --> 40:00.526
I shot him too.

40:00.526 --> 40:02.486
He ran into the beam.

40:02.528 --> 40:04.571
Are you suggesting he wanted to be taken?

40:04.571 --> 40:07.074
I think he saw it was the only way off the planet.

40:07.115 --> 40:10.327
Well, I can tell you from the quality time I spent
with Ford, he was definitely not thinking straight.

40:10.369 --> 40:14.790
Now thanks to you, he's in enemy hands
with information that could compromise all of us.

40:15.207 --> 40:16.834
I don't think he'll give us away.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.878
Oh, thank you so much for your assurance, Colonel.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.257
I'll be sure to include
your 'feelings' in my report.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.191
How is it going?

40:41.567 --> 40:43.402
This place is impressive.

40:43.443 --> 40:46.613
And those Ancestors sure could build them.

40:47.072 --> 40:48.782
The guards are unnecessary.

40:48.866 --> 40:53.245
Well, with your habit of
taking people hostage and all...

40:53.871 --> 40:57.791
I meant, should I want to escape,
they will not be able to stop me.

40:59.459 --> 41:00.794
Alright.

41:01.420 --> 41:03.422
Were you able to contact my home world?

41:03.463 --> 41:05.716
Well, that's why I'm here.

41:17.311 --> 41:19.354
I don't understand.

41:20.606 --> 41:22.649
We have machines called MALPs.

41:22.691 --> 41:27.821
They're capable of transmitting back
images and information from other planets.

41:27.905 --> 41:32.075
We sent this one to the address you gave us.

41:33.702 --> 41:35.662
That is Setita.

41:35.871 --> 41:37.456
I'm sorry.

41:37.497 --> 41:40.834
It doesn't look like anyone survived the last attack.
