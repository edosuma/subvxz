WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:03.568
[LAUGHTER]

00:03.568 --> 00:06.267
Julia: DO YOU THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

00:06.267 --> 00:08.834
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
SOMETHING WILD.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.358
THIS IS ILLEGAL.

00:10.358 --> 00:13.143
DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN SKINNY-DIPPING BEFORE.

00:13.143 --> 00:15.232
NO, I HAVE AS A KID.

00:15.232 --> 00:18.757
I'VE JUST NEVER CRAWLED
BY THE NIGHT WATCHMAN
ON MY BELLY.

00:18.757 --> 00:21.412
JULIA, YOU DON'T
WANNA BE CONSTRAINED

00:21.412 --> 00:24.981
BY THE SMALL-MINDED MORALITY
OF THE SYSTEM, DO YOU?

00:24.981 --> 00:28.245
IT'S LIKE NIETZSCHE SAID:
BE THE SUPER WOMAN.

00:28.245 --> 00:31.248
OH, SPEAKING STRICTLY
FROM A SOCIOPOLITICAL
PERSPECTIVE,

00:31.248 --> 00:32.902
NIETZSCHE WAS NUTBUCKET.

00:32.902 --> 00:35.992
BUT I LIKE
THE SUPER WOMAN STUFF.

00:35.992 --> 00:39.996
IN THAT CASE, TOMORROW NIGHT,
LET'S BUNGEE-JUMP OF THE ROOF

00:39.996 --> 00:42.259
OF THE TRANSAMERICA
BUILDING HOLDING HANDS.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.260
TOMORROW NIGHT?

00:43.260 --> 00:45.349
JULE, I'M KIDDING.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.916
NO, NO, I KNOW.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.613
I'VE JUST BEEN WANTING
TO TELL YOU,

00:48.613 --> 00:51.007
BUT ABOUT
TOMORROW NIGHT--
I CAN'T SEE YOU.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.357
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.359
WHAT, YOU'VE GOT A DATE?

00:55.359 --> 00:57.013
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

00:57.013 --> 00:59.798
I'VE JUST GOT JUSTIN'S PARENTS'
ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

00:59.798 --> 01:00.712
JUSTIN?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.105
MM-HMM.

01:02.105 --> 01:05.456
YOU MEAN YOUR OLD
BOYFRIEND JUSTIN?

01:05.456 --> 01:08.764
NED, THIS IS SO
NOT A BIG DEAL.

01:08.764 --> 01:12.028
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW,
ONE TIME IT'S
YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

01:12.028 --> 01:13.464
THEN IT'S YOUR
EX-BOYFRIEND.

01:13.464 --> 01:14.465
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

01:14.465 --> 01:16.728
GUYS COMING OUT
OF THE WOODWORK.

01:16.728 --> 01:17.903
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE HIM.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.905
I'M GOING TO SEE
HIS MOM AND DAD.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.733
THEY WERE LIKE
MY SECOND PARENTS.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.344
AND HE WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.348
THAT'S ANCIENT HISTORY.

01:27.348 --> 01:30.351
HE'S GOT
A GIRLFRIEND NOW,

01:30.351 --> 01:33.049
AND, NED, I'M WITH YOU.

01:33.049 --> 01:36.661
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.316
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

01:39.316 --> 01:42.928
HEY, IF YOU'RE THERE,
I'M GONNA HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.858

02:25.667 --> 02:27.190
OK.

02:27.190 --> 02:30.672
HEY, MISTER, CAN I HAVE
MY BALL BACK? THANKS.

02:30.672 --> 02:31.934
YOUR BABY'S REALLY PRETTY.

02:33.849 --> 02:35.590
DID YOU HEAR THAT,
CHARLIE?

02:35.590 --> 02:36.939
I GOT IT.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.941
THAT LITTLE GIRL
THINKS I'M A MOM,

02:38.941 --> 02:40.986
THAT I GOT UP
AND BATHED DIANA

02:40.986 --> 02:44.338
AND PUT HER IN
THAT LITTLE PINK JUMPER
INSTEAD OF THE YELLOW ONE.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.296
YOU THINK DIANA
WILL BE AN ATHLETE?

02:46.296 --> 02:47.297
CHARLIE!

02:47.297 --> 02:48.951
SORRY.

02:48.951 --> 02:54.391
IT'S JUST...EVER SINCE PAUL
SAID, "LET'S ADOPT"--

02:54.391 --> 02:58.526
I MEAN, SURE, HE ONLY
SAID IT TO MAKE ME HAPPY,

02:58.526 --> 03:02.051
BUT NOW THAT
HE'S BACKED OUT,

03:02.051 --> 03:05.707
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.838
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT
I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN
ALL OVER AGAIN.

03:06.838 --> 03:07.883
KIRSTEN, DON'T.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.450
ONLY IT'S WORSE THIS TIME,

03:09.450 --> 03:12.409
'CAUSE AT LEAST BEFORE
IT WAS JUST NATURE.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.933
NOW THERE'S SOMEONE
TO BLAME.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.675
I WAKE UP WONDERING
WHY I'M THERE,

03:17.675 --> 03:20.417
OR--OR WHY HE'S THERE.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.419
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL NOW--

03:22.419 --> 03:25.030
NO, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

03:25.030 --> 03:30.035
KIRSTEN, LISTEN TO ME,
BECAUSE I--I KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS,

03:30.035 --> 03:32.429
GIVING UP, I MEAN.
I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT

03:32.429 --> 03:34.301
LYING IN A HOSPITAL BED
LAST YEAR,

03:34.301 --> 03:37.826
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE
DO IT TOO EASILY.

03:37.826 --> 03:40.089
SO, PLEASE, KIRSTEN, DON'T.

03:40.089 --> 03:45.399
JUST...GO HOME, BE WITH PAUL,
AND DON'T GIVE UP.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.796
Girl: I SEE YOU!

03:51.796 --> 03:55.017
HEY, YOU DIDN'T FORGET
TO PICK UP THE NEWSPAPER,
DID YOU?

03:55.017 --> 03:57.062
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
READING IT ANYMORE.

03:57.062 --> 04:00.370
DIDN'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT
ALL THE BAD STUFF THAT
HAPPENS IN THE WORLD.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.547
I NEED THE CLASSIFIEDS.
WANT ADS, ACTUALLY.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.898
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
FIND TIME FOR A JOB?

04:06.898 --> 04:08.726
IT'S NOT FOR ME. HI.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.560
LOOK, BAILEY,
I'VE DONE SOMETHING,

04:16.560 --> 04:18.954
AND YOU'RE
NOT GONNA LIKE IT,

04:18.954 --> 04:20.956
BUT BEFORE YOU LOSE IT--

04:20.956 --> 04:22.610
WHAT? WHAT, SARAH?

04:22.610 --> 04:26.918
I TOLD ALBERT TERRY THAT
I WOULD HELP HIM FIND A JOB.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.964
WHAT?! YOU...

04:28.964 --> 04:31.227
SARAH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:31.227 --> 04:33.882
FIRST YOU MAKE YOURSELF
THE JUDGE AND THE JURY,

04:33.882 --> 04:36.624
AND NOW WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA
BE HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL
OR SOMETHING?

04:36.624 --> 04:38.713
YOU KNOW WHAT? I SHOULD
HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU,

04:38.713 --> 04:41.281
'CAUSE I KNEW THIS
IS EXACTLY HOW YOU
WERE GONNA FEEL.

04:41.281 --> 04:46.242
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL
WHEN I WATCHED THE GUY HOLD
A KNIFE TO YOUR THROAT?

04:46.242 --> 04:47.243
SARAH.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.897
GOOD MORNING, MR. BELMONT.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.465
HI, KIDS.
SAY, WHERE'S
THAT BOY OF YOURS?

04:51.465 --> 04:54.076
YOU KNOW, MY GRANDSON'S
COMING TO VISIT,

04:54.076 --> 04:56.470
SO I THOUGHT I'D
TEACH HIM SOME CHESS.

04:56.470 --> 05:00.082
OH, THAT'S BAILEY'S
LITTLE BROTHER, MR. BELMONT.
HE DOESN'T LIVE WITH US.

05:00.082 --> 05:04.782
OH. WELL, I'M SURE
YOU'LL HAVE ONE OF
YOUR OWN SOMEDAY.

05:04.782 --> 05:07.002
HAVE A GOOD DAY,
MR. BELMONT.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.873
YOU KNOW WHAT,
BAILEY?

05:08.873 --> 05:13.443
ALBERT'S GOT A BABY.

05:13.443 --> 05:18.274
OK. FINE. I'LL GIVE YOU
THE NUMBER OF THE TEMP AGENCY
I USE FOR THE RESTAURANT, OK?

05:18.274 --> 05:21.146
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.931
OH, MY GOD! BY THE TIME
HE GETS HERE,

05:22.931 --> 05:24.236
I'M GONNA HAVE
SO MANY LEADS!

05:24.236 --> 05:25.237
WAIT. WHAT?

05:25.237 --> 05:27.022
HE'S COMING HERE?

05:27.022 --> 05:29.198
ALBERT TERRY'S
NOT COMING HERE.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.635
MY VICTIM SUPPORT GROUP SAID--

05:31.635 --> 05:34.812
SAID WHAT? YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO INVITE YOUR ATTACKER
TO YOEÊUR APARTMENT?

05:34.812 --> 05:38.207
NO. THAT I SHOULD DO SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW, TAKE CONTROL,
FEEL EMPOWERED,

05:38.207 --> 05:40.688
AND THIS IS MY WAY
OF DOING IT.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.647
GOD. OK, IF YOU'RE
REALLY GONNA DO THIS,

05:43.647 --> 05:46.650
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO IT ALONE, OK?

05:46.650 --> 05:48.609
I'LL STAY HOME WITH YOU.

05:48.609 --> 05:52.264
PROTECTING ME LIKE A COP?
NO. NO, BAILEY.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.354
JUST BY THE WAY YOU'LL LOOK
AT HIM, YOU'LL MAKE HIM
FEEL LIKE A CRIMINAL.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.399
HE IS A CRIMINAL, SARAH!

05:56.399 --> 05:59.707
AREN'T YOU EVEN
A LITTLE AFRAID?

05:59.707 --> 06:04.059
BAILEY, I'M DOING THIS
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
FACING MY FEARS

06:04.059 --> 06:06.366
AND HELPING HIM...

06:08.106 --> 06:10.065
HELPING HIM
IS GONNA HELP ME.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.157
OK.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.074
FINE, SARAH, BUT...

06:19.074 --> 06:21.424
DON'T DO IT HERE, OK?

06:21.424 --> 06:25.167
PLEASE.

06:25.167 --> 06:29.824
YEAH. SURE. I'LL CALL HIM
AND TELL HIM DOWNTOWN
INSTEAD OF HERE.

06:31.129 --> 06:31.869
OK.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.137
GRIFFIN.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.969
THANKS FOR COMING DOWN.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.449
YEAH.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.408
CURIOSITY.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.584
I HEARD YOU AND JULIE
WERE HAVING TROUBLE,

06:50.584 --> 06:54.849
BUT I FIGURED I'D
BE THE LAST PERSON
YOU'D WANNA SEE.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.416
NO, NOT THE LAST.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.115
THERE'S THIS--THIS NEW GUY
SHE MET AT SCHOOL.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.596
THAT'S TOUGH, MAN.
I'M SORRY.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.728
WELL, HE'S HITTING HER.

07:04.728 --> 07:05.816
YEAH, WELL, OF COURSE
HE'S HITTING ON HER.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.339
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA GET
USED TO THAT.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.341
NO, JULIA'S NEW BOYFRIEND
IS HITTING HER.

07:13.302 --> 07:16.784
WELL, THEN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE
FIXING FAN BELTS?

07:16.784 --> 07:19.787
SHE WON'T LET ME
ANYWHERE NEAR HER.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.528
SHE...

07:21.528 --> 07:23.312
SHE FILED FOR DIVORCE.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.880
OH, OK. I GET IT.
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.577
I'M NOT JEALOUS HERE.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.927
I MEAN, I AM, BUT...

07:29.927 --> 07:32.190
LOOK, SOMEBODY THAT
SHE'LL LISTEN TO

07:32.190 --> 07:35.367
HAS GOT TO GET HER
TO ADMIT WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.587
OK, SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

07:37.587 --> 07:41.939
YOU WANT ME TO GO DOWN THERE
AND DRAG HER AWAY FROM A GUY

07:41.939 --> 07:43.898
THAT SHE WANTS TO BE WITH?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.945
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WOULDN'T WANNA MESS UP

07:47.945 --> 07:49.860
YOUR SQUASH GAME
AT THE CLUB.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.340
OH, THE HELL
WITH YOU, GRIFFIN.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.559
JUSTIN, LISTEN TO ME,
DAMN IT!

07:54.299 --> 07:56.258
I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
OF ME.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.129
I DON'T LIKE YOU,
EITHER--

07:58.129 --> 08:01.045
HOW YOU WANTED HER
TO LEAVE ME,
AND SHE DID--

08:01.045 --> 08:04.048
SO YOU GOTTA KNOW
YOU'D BE THE LAST
PERSON I CAME TO

08:04.048 --> 08:06.398
IF THERE
WAS ANY OTHER WAY.

08:06.398 --> 08:10.141
SHE'S...

08:10.141 --> 08:13.101
SHE'S ALWAYS
BEEN ABLE TO TALK
TO YOU BETTER THAN ME.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.410
ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

08:18.410 --> 08:20.282
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.851
FOR JULIA.

08:26.854 --> 08:29.726
CODY. CODY, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.729
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW,
CLAUDIA.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.905
THE BOSS IS TOTALLY
RIDING MY BUTT.

08:37.821 --> 08:44.480
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM--I'M REALLY INTERESTED
IN THE NEW JOHN LEE HOOKER CD.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.745
OH! THAT WOULD BE
RIGHT HERE. BIN 3,
"BLUES YOU CAN USE."

08:48.745 --> 08:51.008
DID GRIFFIN TALK TO YOU?

08:51.008 --> 08:53.707
YEAH, HE TOLD ME IF DIDN'T
STOP HANGING OUT WITH YOU
I WAS OUT OF THE BAND.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.709
I CAN'T BELIEVE HIM.
I MEAN, WHY IS--

08:58.625 --> 09:05.327
YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM REALLY
INTERESTED IN THIS NEW
MUDDY WATERS CD DOWN HERE.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.851
MUDDY WA--?
OH, RIGHT, MUDDY WATERS.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.728
I MEAN, WHO DOES GRIFFIN
THINK HE IS, JUST TELLING US
WHAT TO DO LIKE THAT?

09:14.728 --> 09:19.167
RIGHT. WHY WOULD HE
EVEN THINK WE LIKE
EACH OTHER, ANYWAY?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.124
RIGHT.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.781
AND IF WE DID
LIKE EACH OTHER...

09:24.781 --> 09:26.217
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULDN'T WORRY

09:26.217 --> 09:28.132
ABOUT WHAT GRIFFIN SAYS,
ALL RIGHT?

09:28.132 --> 09:30.134
HE RUNS THE BAND,
NOT MY LIFE.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.963
WHERE DOES HE
GET OFF RULING
OVER ME LIKE THAT?

09:32.963 --> 09:35.400
NO ONE
TELLS ME WHAT TO DO,
NOT EVEN MY OLD MAN.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.620
ME NEITHER.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.839
RIGHT.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.235
OK. UH...ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.541
JOHN LEE HOOKER'S
BEST OF FRIENDS.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.543
GREAT. THANK YOU.

09:47.543 --> 09:51.939
HEY, YOU KNOW,
HOOK'S PLAYING TONIGHT
AT THE BOOM BOOM ROOM.

09:51.939 --> 09:55.943
SANTANA'S SITTING IN
AND, WELL, I KNOW
THE GUYS AT THE DOOR

09:55.943 --> 09:57.771
IF MAYBE YOU WANTED TO GO?

09:57.771 --> 10:00.512
ABSOLUTELY. IT'S A DATE.

10:00.512 --> 10:04.212
I MEAN, IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT DATE DATE.
IT'S A...

10:04.212 --> 10:07.650
IT'S A...I'M GOING.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.739
OK. BYE.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.612
OH.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.613
[SIGHS]

10:27.888 --> 10:29.890
SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

10:29.890 --> 10:31.674
Both: USUAL.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.590
YOU?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.636
OH, DID SOME SHOPPING.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.987
SALE AT MACY'S.

10:39.987 --> 10:44.644
AFTER THAT I STOPPED
AT A TRAVEL AGENT.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.473
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE SHOULD...GET AWAY,

10:48.473 --> 10:52.216
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
TAKE THE LONG WEEKEND
AT CANNON BEACH.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.044
WHAT FOR, KIRSTEN?

10:54.044 --> 10:56.394
WELL, DO WE NEED
A SPECIAL REASON?

10:56.394 --> 10:58.048
RIGHT NOW, YES, WE DO,

10:58.048 --> 11:00.964
'CAUSE, WELL, THE IDEA
OF THE 2 OF US ALONE
ON A BEACH,

11:00.964 --> 11:02.879
YOU LOOKING AT ME
WITH THOSE "YOU'VE
LET ME DOWN" EYES,

11:02.879 --> 11:04.446
DOESN'T EXACTLY
SOUND LIKE FUN.

11:04.446 --> 11:06.970
PAUL, I'M NOT--

11:06.970 --> 11:11.409
YOU KNOW WHAT'S EVEN WORSE
THAN THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME?
THE WAY I LOOK AT MYSELF.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.890
WELL, MAYBE GETTING AWAY
WILL HELP.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.849
OUR PROBLEMS WILL
FOLLOW US, KIRSTEN.

11:21.681 --> 11:26.250
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT--ABOUT NOT GOING
TO CANNON BEACH, ARE WE?

11:29.079 --> 11:32.604
KIRSTEN,
WHEN WE DIDN'T GET
ON THAT PLANE FOR TEXAS,

11:32.604 --> 11:35.085
YOU ASKED ME TO BE HONEST.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.134
CAN'T YOU BE HONEST
WITH ME NOW?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.230
I LOVE YOU.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.057
I KNOW.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.585
BUT IT'S OVER.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.327
I KNOW.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.213
AH, THE LEISURE CLASS.
THIS BRINGS BACK A FEW.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.432
Justin: JULIA

12:17.432 --> 12:19.608
JUSTIN, HEY!

12:19.608 --> 12:20.914
HOW ARE YOU?

12:20.914 --> 12:21.915
YEAH? I'M FINE.

12:21.915 --> 12:22.916
YEAH.

12:22.916 --> 12:23.960
HOW'S STANFORD?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.527
I'M ENJOYING IT.
I'M STUDYING A LOT.

12:25.527 --> 12:26.571
NED GRAYSON.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.921
OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.574
NED, UM, JUSTIN.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.402
YEAH, I'VE HEARD
ABOUT YOU.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.708
ME, TOO.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.579
SO, JUSTIN, WHERE'S
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

12:34.579 --> 12:36.233
I REALLY WANT
TO MEET HER.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.582
OH, JENNIFER.

12:37.582 --> 12:41.586
WELL, UM, ABOUT AN HOUR
BEFORE WE GOT ON THE PLANE,

12:41.586 --> 12:44.589
SHE TOLD ME THAT
SHE WAS SLEEPING

12:44.589 --> 12:47.941
WITH OUR ETHICS TEACHER,
SO WE BROKE UP.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.377
Elaine: JULIA?

12:49.377 --> 12:50.944
OH, MY.

12:50.944 --> 12:51.945
HI.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.250
HOW ARE YOU?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.600
OH, IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.081
AND STANFORD? WE ARE
SO PROUD OF YOU.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.126
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
25 YEARS.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.518
OH, I KNOW.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

13:00.518 --> 13:01.476
I GOT YOU A GIFT.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.043
OH, THANK YOU.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.653
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

13:04.653 --> 13:05.654
COME ON OVER HERE.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.699
SO, THE FAMOUS JUSTIN.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.223
YEAH, JUSTIN.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.094
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE FAMOUS PART,
THOUGH.

13:11.094 --> 13:14.358
LOOK, I KNOW ALL
ABOUT YOU AND JULIA,

13:14.358 --> 13:18.449
SO JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE HERE SOLO,
I HOPE YOU GET...

13:18.449 --> 13:21.278
I'M NOT PLANNING
ON HOOKING UP
WITH JULIA.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.933
THEN THERE SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.588
I'M JUST SAYING IT
SO YOU KNOW.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.722
JUSTIN? YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE
SO SWEET?

13:30.722 --> 13:33.073
TO SEE YOU AND JULIA
DANCE TOGETHER AGAIN.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.466
NO, MOM, THAT'S NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.990
OH, COME ON,
JUST FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.121
MOM, PLEASE.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.254
MRS. THOMPSON,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.472
NED?

13:41.472 --> 13:43.518
HEY, JULE, GO AHEAD.
FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.089
JULIA?

14:05.018 --> 14:06.367
SO...THIS GUY NED...

14:06.367 --> 14:07.803
UH-HUH.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.197
HE SEEMS...I DON'T KNOW.

14:10.197 --> 14:12.634
WHAT'S HIS STORY?

14:12.634 --> 14:16.725
WELL, HE'S FROM OAKLAND,

14:16.725 --> 14:19.336
AND HE'S A PHILOSOPHY MAJOR.

14:19.336 --> 14:24.298
YOU KNOW, UH, YOU CAN
TELL ME ANYTHING, JULIA.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

14:24.298 --> 14:28.911
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE I'M
GONE AT YALE DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GONE FROM YOUR LIFE,

14:28.911 --> 14:32.828
AND, YOU KNOW,
IF THIS GUY IS,
I DON'T KNOW--

14:32.828 --> 14:34.786
JUSTIN, WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

14:34.786 --> 14:35.918
HEY, THERE, JUSTIN.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.661
MIND IF I DANCE
WITH MY GIRL?

15:07.863 --> 15:08.908
ALBERT!

15:08.908 --> 15:11.345
UM...WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:11.345 --> 15:14.652
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET AT UNION SQUARE AT 8:00.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.827
YOU--YOU SAID HERE AT 7:00.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.699
YEAH, BUT I CALLED
YOUR SISTER.

15:17.699 --> 15:21.790
UH, YOU KNOW, IF THIS IS
NOT A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW,

15:21.790 --> 15:23.835
I CAN...YOU WANT ME
TO GO AWAY?

15:27.056 --> 15:27.927
NO.

15:30.233 --> 15:30.973
NO. UM...

15:30.973 --> 15:33.584
COME IN.

15:42.071 --> 15:43.594
NICE PLACE.

15:43.594 --> 15:47.598
YOU, UH,
LIVE HERE ALONE?

15:47.598 --> 15:53.387
NO. NO, WITH MY BOYFRIEND,
UM, AND HE'S GONNA BE
HOME REALLY SOON.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.478
WE BETTER
GET STARTED THEN.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.661
LOOK, ALBERT, I THINK YOU'RE
MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.968
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, OK?

16:08.968 --> 16:12.406
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT
ON THE APPLICATION
THAT YOU WERE ARRESTED.

16:12.406 --> 16:15.017
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WANNA BE HONEST.

16:15.017 --> 16:17.672
LOOK, YOU ARE
BEING HONEST, OK?

16:17.672 --> 16:22.677
THE JOB APPLICATION SAYS
"WERE YOU EVER CONVICTED
OF A FELONY?"

16:22.677 --> 16:24.635
ALBERT, YOU WEREN'T
CONVICTED.

16:24.635 --> 16:28.683
OK. UM, IT ASKS HERE
ABOUT YOUR EDUCATION.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.122
DROPPED OUT
IN THE NINTH GRADE.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.690
OK. UM...

16:35.690 --> 16:36.908
EXPERIENCE.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.959
SPECIAL SKILLS...AND ROBBING
A RESTAURANT DOESN'T COUNT.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.310
HA HA HA.

16:49.573 --> 16:53.360
OK. DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO TYPE OR...

16:53.360 --> 16:58.060
I CAN COOK. WELL--WELL,
NOT EXACTLY COOK,

16:58.060 --> 17:02.499
BUT MY SISTER, YOU KNOW,
WHEN HER HUSBAND LEFT,
SHE HAD TO GET TO WORK,

17:02.499 --> 17:05.589
AND SOMEBODY HAD
TO COOK BREAKFAST
FOR ALL THE KIDS.

17:05.589 --> 17:09.158
AND, I'LL TELL YOU,
I LEARNED HOW TO MAKE
A MEAN PANCAKE.

17:09.158 --> 17:12.422
USED TO PUT BERRIES
IN 'EM AND EVERYTHING

17:12.422 --> 17:15.208
WHEN--WHEN WE COULD
AFFORD THEM.

17:15.208 --> 17:19.734
SOMETIMES--SOMETIMES
I THINK I CAN DO THAT,
YOU KNOW?

17:19.734 --> 17:22.650
WHAT, LIKE BE
A SHORT ORDER COOK
OR SOMETHING?

17:22.650 --> 17:26.088
HEY, WHY NOT?

17:26.088 --> 17:28.482
Y-Y-YOU THINK SOMEBODY
WOULD REALLY HIRE ME?

17:28.482 --> 17:30.440
WELL, THAT DEPENDS.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.442
HOW GOOD ARE THOSE PANCAKES?

17:35.576 --> 17:38.622
PAUL KNEW. HE MADE ME
SAY IT, BUT...

17:38.622 --> 17:45.020
HE KNEW OUR MARRIAGE WAS OVER,
MAYBE EVEN BEFORE I DID.

17:45.020 --> 17:49.024
YOU CAN'T BUILD A LIFE
ON THE ABSENCE OF THINGS,

17:49.024 --> 17:51.722
THINGS THAT HE DOESN'T
WANT AND I CAN'T HAVE.

17:53.985 --> 17:58.773
AND, CHARLIE,
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT GIVING UP TOO EASILY,

17:58.773 --> 18:01.819
BUT THIS ISN'T EASY.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.647
AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

18:05.910 --> 18:09.610
MOST OF THE TIME, WHEN--WHEN
PEOPLE LIKE PAUL AND ME,

18:09.610 --> 18:12.221
WHEN--WHEN PEOPLE GET DIVORCED,
EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS,

18:12.221 --> 18:14.310
"PHEW. WELL, AT LEAST
THERE WERE NO KIDS."

18:15.964 --> 18:19.968
AND WITH US,
IF THERE WERE KIDS,

18:19.968 --> 18:22.188
THIS WOULDN'T EVEN
BE HAPPENING.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.016
KIRSTEN...

18:30.500 --> 18:32.676
WHAT AM I GONNA DO, CHARLIE?

18:39.205 --> 18:41.424
I CAN'T GO HOME,
AND I CAN'T FACE HIM.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.517
YOU'LL STAY HERE
WITH US.

18:56.178 --> 19:00.530
DOUBLE NONFAT CAPPUCCINO
WITH THE EXTRA FOAM.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.141
THAT'S HOW
YOU LIKE IT, RIGHT?

19:05.144 --> 19:08.321
YOU KNOW, I E-MAILED YOU
TWICE LAST WEEK.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.454
I'VE BEEN BUSY WITH STUDYING
AND CLASSES AND--

19:11.454 --> 19:12.977
AND THIS GUY NED?

19:15.415 --> 19:18.940
WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING
HIM "THIS GUY NED"?
HIS NAME IS NED.

19:18.940 --> 19:23.031
IS HE, UH, IS HE
TREATING YOU ALL RIGHT?

19:23.031 --> 19:28.123
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--LAST NIGHT
HE SEEMED SORT OF...

19:29.733 --> 19:32.258
UH, I DON'T KNOW...
UH, INTENSE...

19:33.520 --> 19:34.956
AS IN POSSESSIVE.

19:34.956 --> 19:38.394
INTENSE, YEAH, YEAH,
ABOUT ME.

19:38.394 --> 19:42.659
AND HE PUSHES ME TO TAKE RISKS
AND CHALLENGE MYSELF,

19:42.659 --> 19:47.273
AND WE DO STUFF LIKE, UH,
WE SNUCK INTO THE SCHOOL POOL.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.972
MMM? I HAVEN'T DONE THAT SINCE
I WAS WITH YOU, REMEMBER?

19:50.972 --> 19:54.018
SOMETHING I WON'T
EASILY FORGET.

19:54.018 --> 19:57.413
GRIFFIN AND I, WE NEVER
DID STUFF LIKE THAT.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.155
IT WAS ALL ABOUT FINDING
THE MONEY TO PAY THE RENT,

20:00.155 --> 20:02.636
OR HOW ARE WE GONNA KEEP
THE SHOP, OR--

20:02.636 --> 20:03.985
JULIA, IS THAT YOU?

20:03.985 --> 20:04.986
RAY.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.031
OH, GOOD. DOES THIS MEAN

20:07.031 --> 20:08.555
THAT I CAN GO BACK
TO MY ROOM NOW?

20:08.555 --> 20:13.386
I HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT
ON A COUCH IN THE STUDENT UNION.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.388
MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.303
OH, SURE, RAY.
I'M--I'M SORRY.

20:20.523 --> 20:21.785
I GOTTA GO.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.005
WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU JUST GOT HERE.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.789
THAT GUY RAY
IS NED'S ROOMMATE.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.226
SO?

20:27.226 --> 20:30.054
SO, I DIDN'T TELL NED
THAT I WAS COMING HERE.

20:30.054 --> 20:33.928
WHAT--OH, YOU GOTTA TELL
NED WHAT YOU'RE DOING
EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY?

20:33.928 --> 20:36.800
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA GET
PERMISSION TO SEE ME?

20:36.800 --> 20:39.629
WHAT IS WITH
THE THIRD DEGREE, HUH?

20:39.629 --> 20:42.632
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK,
ARE THINGS PERFECT?

20:42.632 --> 20:45.244
NO, NO, BUT THEY'RE
SO, SO CLOSE.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.991
LISTEN, GUYS, I GOT
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR BAND.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.603
UH, I NAILED DOWN
OUR FIRST GIG.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.996
TOMORROW NIGHT
AT THE CHOP SHOP.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.955
COOL. COOL.

21:00.955 --> 21:03.000
DID HE SAY
TOMORROW NIGHT?

21:03.000 --> 21:06.134
YEAH, BECAUSE OUR SEARCH
FOR A LEAD SINGER IS OVER.

21:06.134 --> 21:10.573
THANKS TO CODY'S TIP, THE
JULIENNE FRIES
ARE BREAKING UP,

21:10.573 --> 21:12.358
AND GUESS WHO SAID
SHE'D SING FOR US?

21:12.358 --> 21:14.273
MELANIE! COME ON DOWN.

21:15.622 --> 21:16.623
HEY.

21:16.623 --> 21:17.624
HEY.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.278
HEY.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.540
HEY.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.193
HEY, HOW
ARE YOU? WOW.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.064
HOW'S MY FAVORITE
BASS PLAYER?

21:23.064 --> 21:25.066
OH, I'M GOOD.
I'M GREAT.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.373
WOW, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.810
JUST PROMISE ME WHEN
YOU QUIT THIS BAND YOU'LL
WAIT UNTIL THE GIG'S OVER, OK?

21:29.810 --> 21:30.811
I TOLD THEM--

21:30.811 --> 21:32.116
NO NEW WAVE.

21:32.116 --> 21:33.117
RIGHT.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.162
AHEM.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.164
OH, I'M SORRY.
MELANIE,

21:36.164 --> 21:39.602
THIS IS CLAUDIA.
SHE PLAYS THE FIDDLE.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.909
HEY. I'M REALLY
PSYCHED TO BE PLAYING
WITH YOU GUYS.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.085
YEAH. NO DISCO EITHER.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.090
YOU MADE BREAKFAST?

21:50.961 --> 21:51.962
PANCAKES.

21:53.529 --> 21:54.835
SARAH, HEY.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.793
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE FIGHT

21:56.793 --> 21:59.405
WE HAD YESTERDAY,
FORGET IT, OK?

21:59.405 --> 22:02.582
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD
TO DEAL WITH THIS GUY.

22:02.582 --> 22:05.541
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU DID IT DOWNTOWN.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.369
I DIDN'T MEET HIM
DOWNTOWN, BAILEY.

22:07.369 --> 22:10.546
TELL ME THAT MEANS THAT
YOU DIDN'T MEET HIM AT ALL.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.940
I CALLED HIM. I TRIED,
BUT HIS SISTER DIDN'T
GIVE HIM THE MESSAGE,

22:12.940 --> 22:14.855
SO HE SHOWED UP HERE
ANYWAY,

22:14.855 --> 22:17.161
AND WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO, JUST SLAM
THE DOOR IN HIS FACE?

22:17.161 --> 22:19.903
YES, YOU WERE.
SARAH, YOU TOLD ME THAT--

22:19.903 --> 22:21.296
BAILEY, I COULDN'T
DO THAT.

22:21.296 --> 22:22.384
I MEAN, I INVITED
HIM HERE TO BEGIN WITH.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.038
SARAH--

22:24.038 --> 22:26.083
NO, I CAN'T LIVE MY LIFE
THINKING THAT AROUND
EVERY CORNER

22:26.083 --> 22:27.258
SOMEBODY'S JUST
GONNA HURT ME.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.609
SO YOU TAKE SOMEBODY
THAT DID HURT YOU,

22:29.609 --> 22:32.307
AND YOU BRING HIM
INTO YOUR HOME, OUR HOME?

22:32.307 --> 22:33.569
BAILEY, I FEEL BETTER.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.484
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
WHAT MATTERS?

22:35.484 --> 22:38.879
SO INSTEAD
OF YELLING AT ME,

22:38.879 --> 22:41.229
WHY DON'T YOU TRY,
"I'M PROUD OF YOU,
SARAH,

22:41.229 --> 22:43.231
FOR DOING SOMETHING
THAT YOU SET OUT TO DO,"
YOU KNOW?

22:43.231 --> 22:46.234
OR "I'M HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE SAFE
AND THAT YOU FEEL SAFE."

22:46.234 --> 22:48.497
OF COURSE I'M HAPPY
THAT YOU FEEL SAFE.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.543
OK, SO THEN LEAVE IT.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.502
YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
TO SEE ALBERT ANYMORE.

22:53.502 --> 22:54.460
IT'S OVER.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.465
LET ME JUST EXPLAIN TO YOU--

22:59.465 --> 23:01.292
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND, JULIA.

23:01.292 --> 23:02.424
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GOING TO THE LIBRARY.
WHY WOULD YOU LIE?

23:02.424 --> 23:03.991
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE UPSET.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.993
THEN WHY WOULD YOU GO?

23:05.993 --> 23:06.689
WHY WOULD YOU
ACTUALLY GO AND DO
SOMETHING PURPOSELY

23:06.689 --> 23:07.821
THAT YOU KNOW WOULD
UPSET ME?

23:07.821 --> 23:08.822
BECAUSE HE LEFT ME A MESSAGE

23:08.822 --> 23:09.953
SAYING HE NEEDED TO SEE ME.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.738
SO JUSTIN'S MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU THAN ME?

23:11.738 --> 23:12.739
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.741
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
HOW IT MADE ME FEEL

23:14.741 --> 23:17.091
TO HAVE RAY CASUALLY
WALK IN AND SAY
HE'D SEEN YOU

23:17.091 --> 23:18.919
AT THE CAFETERIA
WITH SOME GUY?

23:18.919 --> 23:20.834
AND THEN, WORSE,
IT TURNS OUT TO BE HIM?

23:20.834 --> 23:22.183
IT WAS STUPID.
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.

23:22.183 --> 23:23.793

23:26.100 --> 23:28.058
I'M NOT STUPID, JULIA.

23:28.058 --> 23:28.972

I LOVE YOU.

OF SHOWING IT.

SOME STUPID PARTY,

"OH, DON'T WORRY,

A GIRLFRIEND,"

WITH HIM!

23:37.154 --> 23:39.113
YOU TOLD ME TO DO THAT.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.114

OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA
LOOK LIKE A JERK!

23:41.898 --> 23:43.030
BUT YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A JERK.

23:43.030 --> 23:43.857
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT, JULIA.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.467
YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN THAT,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.469
BECAUSE COUPLES ARE SUPPOSED TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THE OTHER FEELS.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.731

I'M SORRY. I SHOULD
NEVER HAVE LIED TO YOU,

24:16.193 --> 24:17.934
AND I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE
TO THAT PARTY,

24:17.934 --> 24:20.415
AND I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE DANCED WITH JUSTIN.
I'M SORRY, OK?

24:23.723 --> 24:24.811
I'M SORRY. I'M...

IN PRIVATE.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.049
I WANTED HIM HERE.

ANYTHING WRONG.

BLAME SOMEONE, IT'S ME.

IN THIS DIVORCE?

WANT ANYTHING"
ATTITUDE

25:44.020 --> 25:45.500
COMING OUT OF GUILT?

25:45.500 --> 25:49.025
NO, NO. IT IS NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

I GET THE NAME

SPITS OUT THE SAME SUSPECT
THAT ROBBED YOUR RESTAURANT.

34:40.339 --> 34:41.862
COINCIDENCE?

34:41.862 --> 34:44.560
SOMEONE WANNA EXPLAIN
TO ME HOW THIS GUY

34:44.560 --> 34:48.086
JUST HAPPENS TO BURGLARIZE
THE SAME BUILDING
YOU LIVE IN?

34:48.086 --> 34:50.349
YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY CONTACT
WITH HIM, RIGHT?

34:50.349 --> 34:55.093
UM...HE WAS HERE
LAST NIGHT
IN THE APARTMENT.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.662
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED US.

34:59.662 --> 35:02.230
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP HIM
FIND A JOB.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.233
WAS MR. TERRY EVER ALONE
IN THE APARTMENT?

35:05.233 --> 35:08.410
NO. NO, I WAS ALWAYS
WITH HIM.

35:08.410 --> 35:10.543
YOU NEVER LET HIM OUT
OF YOUR SIGHT?

35:10.543 --> 35:13.633
NO. NOT UNLESS IT WAS
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
OR ANSWER THE PHONE,

35:13.633 --> 35:15.504
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT
ONLY TAKES A MINUTE.

35:15.504 --> 35:18.116
WELL, THAT'S ALL IT TAKES
FOR ONE OF THESE GUYS

35:18.116 --> 35:19.639
TO SEARCH THE APARTMENT,
STEAL YOUR KEYS.

35:19.639 --> 35:23.643
AT LEAST WE KNOW HOW HE GOT
IN THE BUILDING.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.340
HERE'S MY CARD.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.125
YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE,

35:27.125 --> 35:28.909
THIS GUY TRIES
TO CONTACT YOU IN ANY WAY,

35:28.909 --> 35:30.128
YOU CALL ME IMMEDIATELY.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.480
OH, AND, MISS MERRIN,
I WOULDN'T WORRY

35:34.480 --> 35:37.309
ABOUT TRYING
TO FIND THIS GUY A JOB.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.615
HE SEEMS TO HAVE ONE
HE LIKES.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.792
OH, MY GOD.
I DID THIS.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.098
WAIT A SECOND.

35:44.098 --> 35:45.839
NO. IF I HADN'T
BROUGHT ALBERT HERE--

35:45.839 --> 35:47.841
NO, BAILEY,
YOU WARNED ME.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.625
I MEAN, WHAT WAS
I THINKING?

35:49.625 --> 35:51.410
HE NEEDS A CHANCE--
BAILEY,
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

35:51.410 --> 35:54.064
I MEAN, AN OLD MAN
MAY BE DYING

35:54.064 --> 35:55.414
IN THE HOSPITAL
RIGHT NOW

35:55.414 --> 35:56.415
BECAUSE OF ME.

35:56.415 --> 35:57.416
WAIT A SECOND.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.244
WHAT? WHAT IS IT,
BAILEY?

35:59.244 --> 36:01.376
GET DETECTIVE LOPEZ
BACK HERE.

36:01.376 --> 36:02.377
WHY?

36:02.377 --> 36:04.640
MY GUN IS MISSING.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.166
YOUR GUN?
YOU HAVE A GUN?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.080
ALBERT STOLE MY GUN.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.171
YOU BOUGHT A GUN,
EVEN WHEN I ASKED
YOU NOT TO?

36:16.348 --> 36:17.871
I HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.535
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENING.

36:32.364 --> 36:35.280
YEAH. I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D HAVE A GUN.

36:37.282 --> 36:40.372
I BOUGHT IT AFTER ALBERT TERRY
ATTACKED YOU.

36:40.372 --> 36:43.026
YEAH, AND AFTER YOU KNEW
HOW I FELT ABOUT IT,

36:43.026 --> 36:46.421
AND I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT A GUN
IN THE APARTMENT--

36:46.421 --> 36:48.467
LOOK, HE WAS STILL
OUT THERE, SARAH.

36:48.467 --> 36:51.121
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.688
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU COULD HAVE
LISTENED TO ME.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.821
AND JOINED A SUPPORT GROUP?

36:54.821 --> 36:59.391
WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT HAVE
DONE US IF ALBERT TERRY
HAD COME HERE TO ROB US, HUH?

36:59.391 --> 37:02.872
WHAT GOOD
DID YOUR GUN DO?

37:02.872 --> 37:04.526
BE FAIR, SARAH, 'CAUSE,

37:04.526 --> 37:06.920
OK, MAYBE THAT WAS MY GUN
THAT HE USED--

37:06.920 --> 37:09.879
IT WAS YOUR GUN, BAILEY.
IT WAS DEFINITELY YOUR GUN.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.272
OK, IT WAS MY GUN,

37:11.272 --> 37:14.232
BUT HOW DID
HE GET MY GUN?

37:14.232 --> 37:15.581
YOU LET HIM
INTO OUR APARTMENT.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.366
YOU'RE RIGHT.
BAILEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.325
IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE,
A HUGE ONE.

37:20.325 --> 37:22.892
YEAH, WELL, TELL THAT
TO OUR NEIGHBORS,

37:22.892 --> 37:25.243
'CAUSE THEY GOT
ROBBED TONIGHT BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.853
THAT'S WHY
MR. BELMONT GOT SHOT.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.986
WITH A GUN THAT YOU BOUGHT
TO MAKE US FEEL SAFE.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.863
YOU REALLY, UH,
KICKED SOME ASS UP THERE.

37:36.863 --> 37:39.561
THANKS.
IT WAS--IT WAS AWESOME.

37:39.561 --> 37:42.608
I MEAN, PLAYING
IN THE SHED AND THEN
GETTING OUT HERE,

37:42.608 --> 37:44.392
YOU KNOW,
WITH ALL THE CROWD

37:44.392 --> 37:47.439
AND ALL THE PEOPLE
CLAPPING AND DANCING.

37:47.439 --> 37:48.483
IT'S A RUSH, ISN'T IT?

37:48.483 --> 37:49.963
YEAH.

37:49.963 --> 37:52.052
AWESOME SHOW, MAN.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.578
SO YOU AND MELANIE,
YOU KNOW,

37:56.578 --> 38:00.278
SEEMED TO BE HAVING
A...FUN TIME OUT THERE.

38:00.278 --> 38:04.369
UM, YEAH. I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WE USED TO PLAY TOGETHER
WITH THE FRIES.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.545
AND WE WERE KINDA,
YOU KNOW, DATING

38:06.545 --> 38:09.156
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

38:09.156 --> 38:12.464
OH, AND GRIFFIN...
GRIFFIN KNEW THAT.

38:12.464 --> 38:16.468
THAT'S--WELL,
YOU KNOW, I COULD SEE
WHY YOU'D LIKE HER.

38:16.468 --> 38:19.035
SHE'S GOT THE PRETTY
HAIR THING GOING,

38:19.035 --> 38:21.299
AND--AND I'M NOT SAYING
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A GOOD VOICE.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.039
SHE DEFINITELY
HAS A GOOD VOICE,

38:23.039 --> 38:25.477
AND--WELL, I JUST--
I REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY A GUY LIKE YOU

38:25.477 --> 38:26.260
WOULD LIKE HER, 'CAUSE--

38:34.747 --> 38:36.139
WOW.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.973
I NEED TO KNOW
SOMETHING, CODY.

38:43.973 --> 38:46.193
JUST--DID YOU JUST
DO THAT 'CAUSE GRIFFIN
TOLD YOU NOT TO?

38:46.193 --> 38:47.455
NO.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.848
I MEAN, TO MAKE A POINT?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.850
NO. NO.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.940
I DID THAT BECAUSE
I WANTED TO.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.001
CHARLIE?

39:15.265 --> 39:16.702
YOU HOME?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.792
CHARLIE?

39:23.012 --> 39:24.971
HEY, YOU OK?

39:24.971 --> 39:26.755
I WAS CALLING YOU.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.149
YEAH. NO. I'M FINE.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.324
WHERE, UM,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

39:30.324 --> 39:32.021
[SIGHS]

39:32.021 --> 39:33.806
GETTING MY STUFF.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.113
KIRSTEN, LISTEN, UM...

39:39.028 --> 39:41.727
I'VE BEEN THINKING,
AND...

39:41.727 --> 39:44.382
LAST NIGHT,
SOMETHING HAPPENED...

39:44.382 --> 39:45.861
CHARLIE--

39:45.861 --> 39:47.472
AND IT KEPT ME
UP ALL NIGHT THINKING ABOUT IT,

39:47.472 --> 39:48.995
BUT I THINK I'VE
FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.998
CHARLIE...I DON'T--

39:51.998 --> 39:55.871
I DON'T THINK. I MEAN...
MAYBE--MAYBE NOW'S
NOT THE BEST TIME.

39:55.871 --> 39:57.438
LOOK.
HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

40:00.049 --> 40:01.137
WHAT IS IT?

40:01.137 --> 40:02.922
A FILE.

40:02.922 --> 40:05.141
WELL, AN INVESTIGATION,
ACTUALLY,

40:05.141 --> 40:08.101
THAT MARTHA LEVITON
DID ON DAPHNE

40:08.101 --> 40:09.494
WHEN I WAS FREAKED OUT
ABOUT CUSTODY.

40:09.494 --> 40:10.495
REMEMBER THAT?

40:11.931 --> 40:14.586
SO THIS IS A LAUNDRY LIST

40:14.586 --> 40:16.979
OF ALL THE BAD THINGS
DAPHNE'S DONE IN HER LIFE?

40:16.979 --> 40:18.241
NO. THAT'S THE THING.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.243
IT'S NOT.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.855
I MEAN, YEAH,
THAT STUFF'S IN THERE,
BUT I KNEW ALL OF THAT.

40:22.855 --> 40:24.465
IT'S THE STUFF THAT
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.815
THE STUFF THAT
I DON'T EVEN THINK
DAPHNE KNOWS ABOUT.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.861
DAPHNE DOESN'T KNOW STUFF
ABOUT HER OWN LIFE?

40:32.691 --> 40:36.042
IF SHE DID,
I DON'T KNOW...

40:36.042 --> 40:38.218
THINGS MIGHT HAVE
BEEN DIFFERENT.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.262
CHARLIE--

40:39.262 --> 40:41.569
SHE'S GOTTA KNOW,
KIRSTEN.

40:43.615 --> 40:45.704
I GOTTA FIND HER.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.754
GOD! MR. BELMONT,
I MEAN,

40:52.754 --> 40:54.626
HE SEEMED PRETTY OK,
DON'T YOU THINK?

40:54.626 --> 40:56.541
YEAH, HE DID.

40:56.541 --> 40:58.978
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA,
TELLING HIM THAT
WE'D BE BRINGING OWEN BY

40:58.978 --> 41:01.023
TO PLAY CHESS
WHEN HE GETS HOME.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.938
YEAH. WELL, THE DOCTOR
SAID THAT HE WOULD
BE OUT NEXT WEEK.

41:02.938 --> 41:05.245
YEAH.

41:05.245 --> 41:07.900
I'M GONNA CALL
THE SECURITY GUY
TOMORROW MORNING.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.512
I'M GONNA HAVE HIM PUT
NEW LOCKS ON THE DOORS
AND THE WINDOWS.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.296
PUT IN AN ALARM.

41:13.296 --> 41:15.821
BUT...

41:15.821 --> 41:19.259
SARAH, IF IT WOULD
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER...

41:19.259 --> 41:21.304
DO YOU WANT TO MOVE?

41:21.304 --> 41:23.132
WE COULD GET A PLACE
IN A SAFER NEIGHBORHOOD.

41:23.132 --> 41:23.785
NO.

41:25.700 --> 41:29.051
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT
I YELLED AT YOU.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.314
YOU KNOW, I JUST
TRIED TO TAKE CONTROL

41:31.314 --> 41:32.751
TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT MY FEARS,

41:32.751 --> 41:36.145
AND ALL I ENDED UP DOING
WAS GIVING THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.408
AND NOW, BECAUSE OF ME,

41:38.408 --> 41:40.933
EVERYBODY
IN OUR BUILDING IS JUST
AS FRIGHTENED AS I WAS.

41:40.933 --> 41:43.152
I DON'T KNOW, BAILEY.

41:43.152 --> 41:47.374
I GUESS I JUST ACTUALLY
THOUGHT THAT FAITH
WAS ENOUGH, YOU KNOW?

41:49.158 --> 41:52.248
THERE'S SO MUCH STUFF
OUT THERE...

41:52.248 --> 41:54.729
THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY CONTROL OVER.

41:54.729 --> 41:57.471
WE HOLD ON TO WHAT
WE CAN HOLD ONTO.

42:00.343 --> 42:03.346
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY DO
MAKE ME FEEL SAFE.

42:04.870 --> 42:08.961
I MEAN, GOD,
HAVING SOMEONE...

42:08.961 --> 42:11.529
HAVING YOU...

42:11.529 --> 42:14.532
LOVE ME LIKE YOU DO...

42:14.532 --> 42:16.011
IT REALLY DOES HELP.

42:35.727 --> 42:37.859
WHERE YA BEEN?

42:39.339 --> 42:41.602
THE LIBRARY.

42:41.602 --> 42:42.951
AGAIN?

42:44.692 --> 42:46.781
TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT?

42:46.781 --> 42:51.307
MY, UH,
STUDY GROUP WENT OUT
FOR A BITE TO EAT.

42:55.181 --> 42:55.877
WHAT'S WRONG?

42:58.619 --> 43:00.447
JUSTIN CAME BY
LAST NIGHT.

43:00.447 --> 43:01.927
HE WHAT?

43:01.927 --> 43:05.539
I TOLD HIM NOT TO DO THAT.
I'M--I'M SORRY.

43:05.539 --> 43:08.847
YOU--YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T--
I MEAN, I DIDN'T INVITE HIM--

43:08.847 --> 43:10.979
I KNOW.

43:10.979 --> 43:13.547
HE CAME BY
TO SAY...GOOD-BYE.

43:15.680 --> 43:18.247
SO YOU'RE NOT MAD?

43:18.247 --> 43:20.206
NO.

43:20.206 --> 43:22.425
ACTUALLY, HE'S...

43:22.425 --> 43:24.253
KIND OF, UH...

43:24.253 --> 43:25.472
AN OK GUY.

43:28.518 --> 43:30.869
BUT YOU'RE
A MUCH BETTER DANCER.

43:30.869 --> 43:33.480
I GUESS WE SHOULD
GO DANCING MORE OFTEN.

43:35.395 --> 43:38.703
GOD, I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
TO A CLUB IN, LIKE, FOREVER.

43:38.703 --> 43:40.487
NO. I MEAN, RIGHT HERE.

43:46.449 --> 43:48.887
