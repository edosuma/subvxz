WEBVTT

01:35.590 --> 01:38.133
Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?

01:46.726 --> 01:48.769
Justin!

01:48.853 --> 01:51.939
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

02:01.116 --> 02:03.242
Justin, you get back here right now!

02:03.660 --> 02:04.660
No, stop!

02:04.744 --> 02:07.162
No, no! Stop him!
Go back! Don't climb!

02:11.960 --> 02:12.960
Wait, wait.

02:13.044 --> 02:15.129
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

02:16.506 --> 02:18.757
Okay, stop, child!
Stop right there. No!

02:20.051 --> 02:23.012
No, no, no! Oh! There he goes.

02:34.524 --> 02:35.691
Justin!

02:44.409 --> 02:46.160
I've got him! I've got him!

02:57.130 --> 02:59.548
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

02:59.633 --> 03:02.426
that the Great Pyramid of
Giza had been stolen

03:02.510 --> 03:05.346
and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.

03:05.555 --> 03:08.599
There is panic throughout the
globe as countries and citizens

03:08.892 --> 03:11.727
try to protect their beloved landmarks.

03:12.312 --> 03:14.813
Law enforcement still has no leads,

03:14.898 --> 03:17.316
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

03:17.400 --> 03:19.902
is responsible for this heinous crime?

03:20.236 --> 03:22.029
And where will he strike next?

04:10.954 --> 04:13.372
I'm having a bad, bad day

04:13.456 --> 04:16.500
It's about time that I get my way

04:16.584 --> 04:19.168
Steamrolling whatever I see

04:19.838 --> 04:22.506
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!

04:22.590 --> 04:24.717
I'm having a bad, bad day

04:24.801 --> 04:27.845
If you take it personal, that's okay

04:27.929 --> 04:30.556
Watch, this is so fun to see

04:31.683 --> 04:33.267
Despicable me

04:58.334 --> 05:00.294
Morning, Gru!

05:01.337 --> 05:02.713
How you doing?

05:02.797 --> 05:04.840
Hello, Fred.

05:04.924 --> 05:07.801
FYI, your dog has been leaving

05:07.886 --> 05:09.970
little bombs all over my yard,

05:10.054 --> 05:11.388
and I don't appreciate it.

05:11.473 --> 05:14.099
Sorry. You know dogs.

05:14.184 --> 05:15.851
They go wherever they want to go.

05:15.935 --> 05:17.686
Unless they're dead.

05:20.273 --> 05:21.398
I'm joking!

05:22.525 --> 05:25.402
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

05:26.321 --> 05:28.947
Oh, okay. Uh... Yeah.

05:29.741 --> 05:32.951
Steamrolling whatever I see

05:33.870 --> 05:35.287
Despicable me

05:35.705 --> 05:38.123
I'm having a bad, bad day

05:38.208 --> 05:40.876
If you take it personal,
that's okay

05:45.215 --> 05:46.882
Despicable me

05:52.055 --> 05:55.307
You've got to
be pulling on my leg!

05:59.229 --> 06:00.729
Hello!

06:01.356 --> 06:03.232
Cookies for sale.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.569
Go away. I'm not home.

06:07.946 --> 06:10.405
Yes, you are. I heard you.

06:10.573 --> 06:14.284
No, you didn't. This

06:14.369 --> 06:16.328
is a recording.

06:16.412 --> 06:18.497
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

06:19.082 --> 06:23.293
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.

06:27.090 --> 06:28.882
Goodbye, recorded message.

06:28.967 --> 06:30.801
Agnes, come on.

06:33.263 --> 06:34.304
Huh?

06:41.104 --> 06:42.563
Kyle!

06:42.647 --> 06:46.650
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.

06:46.734 --> 06:47.901
Gru!

06:48.570 --> 06:50.487
Ah, Dr. Nefario.

06:50.655 --> 06:52.239
I know how you must be feeling.

06:52.323 --> 06:55.784
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,

06:56.452 --> 07:00.289
but in my eyes, you will
always be one of the greats.

07:00.957 --> 07:02.416
What? What happened?

07:02.500 --> 07:03.917
It's all over the news!

07:04.002 --> 07:06.044
Some fella just stole a pyramid.

07:06.129 --> 07:09.381
They're saying he makes
all other villains look

07:10.174 --> 07:11.675
lame.

07:14.012 --> 07:16.096
Assemble the minions!

07:46.753 --> 07:48.545
Minions, assemble!

07:49.631 --> 07:51.048
Okay. Okay.

07:53.134 --> 07:54.134
Throo...

07:58.139 --> 07:59.222
Hey!

08:46.688 --> 08:49.314
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

08:49.399 --> 08:50.649
All right.

08:50.733 --> 08:53.735
That's my Billy boy!
What up, Larry?

08:54.737 --> 08:56.780
Hello, everybody!

08:56.864 --> 08:58.740
Yeah, all right!

08:58.825 --> 09:01.159
Simmer down. Simmer down!

09:01.244 --> 09:03.161
Thank you, okay.

09:03.246 --> 09:06.123
Now, I realize that you guys probably heard

09:06.416 --> 09:09.000
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

09:09.085 --> 09:11.378
Apparently, it's a big deal.

09:11.462 --> 09:14.881
People are calling it the crime of
the century and stuff like that.

09:14.966 --> 09:19.136
But am I upset? No, I am not!

09:20.680 --> 09:22.055
A little,

09:22.140 --> 09:26.101
but we have had a pretty
good year ourselves,

09:26.185 --> 09:29.020
and you guys are all right in my book.

09:30.189 --> 09:31.440
No, no raises!

09:31.524 --> 09:34.693
You're not going to get any raises.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.195
What did we do?

09:37.280 --> 09:43.285
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!

09:43.786 --> 09:44.995
Nice!

09:45.121 --> 09:46.580
Huh?

09:46.664 --> 09:48.707
That's how I roll.

09:49.125 --> 09:52.794
Yeah, you all like watching
football on that, huh?

09:53.629 --> 09:55.005
But that's not all.

09:55.089 --> 09:58.383
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

10:00.136 --> 10:02.471
The small one from Las Vegas.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.643
And I won't even mention
the Eiffel Tower! Also Vegas.

10:08.728 --> 10:11.521
Okay, I wasn't going to
tell you about this yet,

10:11.606 --> 10:16.318
but I have been working on
something very big!

10:17.195 --> 10:21.573
Something that will blow this pyramid
thing out of the water!

10:22.158 --> 10:26.495
And thanks to the efforts of
my good friend Dr. Nefario...

10:26.871 --> 10:27.913
Thank you!

10:27.997 --> 10:29.706
Oh, there he is.

10:29.791 --> 10:31.291
He's styling.

10:31.876 --> 10:35.253
Now, we have located a shrink ray

10:35.338 --> 10:39.966
in a secret lab, and once
we take this shrink ray,

10:40.259 --> 10:43.428
we will have the capability

10:43.513 --> 10:47.516
to pull off the true crime of the century.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.685
We are going to steal...

10:53.231 --> 10:57.651
Wait, wait! I haven't
told you what it is yet.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.030
Hey.

11:02.114 --> 11:04.241
Dave, listen up, please.

11:08.871 --> 11:12.290
Next, we are going to steal,

11:12.375 --> 11:14.709
pause for effect,

11:15.545 --> 11:17.462
the moon!

11:18.923 --> 11:22.759
And once the moon is mine,

11:23.219 --> 11:27.556
the world will give me whatever
I want to get it back!

11:27.640 --> 11:32.978
And I will be the greatest
villain of all time!

11:36.023 --> 11:39.484
That's what I'm talking about.

11:41.821 --> 11:42.863
Yes?

11:43.030 --> 11:46.741
Hello, Gru? I've been
crunching some numbers,

11:46.826 --> 11:49.995
and I really don't see how
we can afford this.

11:50.079 --> 11:52.914
It can't be done.
I'm not a miracle worker.

11:53.374 --> 11:54.958
Hey, chillax.

11:55.042 --> 11:58.712
I'll just get another loan
from the bank. They love me!

12:14.353 --> 12:16.062
Edith, stop it!

12:16.147 --> 12:18.273
What? I'm just walking.

12:31.078 --> 12:33.163
Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

12:36.042 --> 12:37.542
Hello, girls!

12:37.627 --> 12:40.462
Anybody come to adopt us while we were out?

12:40.630 --> 12:43.423
Mmm. Let me think.

12:43.883 --> 12:44.966
No!

12:48.179 --> 12:51.306
Edith! What did you put on my desk?

12:51.682 --> 12:53.350
A mud pie.

12:53.434 --> 12:58.021
You're never gonna get adopted,
Edith. You know that, don't you?

12:58.105 --> 12:59.564
Yeah, I know.

12:59.649 --> 13:00.649
Good.

13:00.733 --> 13:04.110
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

13:04.946 --> 13:06.237
Sort of.

13:06.322 --> 13:10.575
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30
choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties.

13:12.495 --> 13:14.663
Okay.

13:15.039 --> 13:18.917
Well, you say that like
it's a great sale day.

13:19.001 --> 13:21.169
Look at my face!

13:21.253 --> 13:24.506
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

13:25.424 --> 13:27.425
Eighteen coco-nutties.

13:27.843 --> 13:32.514
I think we can do a little better
than that, don't you?

13:33.349 --> 13:34.391
Yeah.

13:34.475 --> 13:38.853
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

13:39.271 --> 13:40.438
No, Miss Hattie.

13:40.523 --> 13:44.234
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.529
Hi, Penny. Hi, Penny.

13:47.613 --> 13:48.780
Hi, guys.

13:53.744 --> 13:56.955
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...

13:57.331 --> 14:00.583
I just wanted to congratulate
you on stealing the pyramid.

14:00.918 --> 14:03.044
That was you, wasn't it?

14:03.379 --> 14:07.549
Or was it a villain who's
actually successful?

14:08.050 --> 14:10.802
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

14:10.886 --> 14:13.680
that's very, very big, very important.

14:14.056 --> 14:16.808
When you hear about it, you're going to be
very proud.

14:18.352 --> 14:21.563
Good luck with that.
Okay, I'm out of here.

15:29.882 --> 15:31.966
Gru to see Mr. Perkins.

15:32.426 --> 15:34.469
Yes, please have a seat.

15:46.065 --> 15:48.858
That's one small step for man,

15:51.362 --> 15:53.112
one giant leap for mankind.

15:53.197 --> 15:55.990
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.

15:56.116 --> 15:58.952
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

15:59.286 --> 16:01.704
NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore.

16:10.464 --> 16:11.506
Hey.

16:18.931 --> 16:23.142
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

16:27.731 --> 16:29.232
It's a mathematical term,

16:29.316 --> 16:33.820
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

16:37.825 --> 16:39.826
Vector! That's me,

16:39.910 --> 16:45.164
'cause I'm committing crimes with
both direction and magnitude.

16:45.249 --> 16:46.916
Oh, yeah!

16:49.044 --> 16:50.628
Check out my new weapon.

16:50.713 --> 16:52.964
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

16:53.048 --> 16:55.174
Fires live piranhas.
Ever seen one before?

16:55.259 --> 16:56.843
No, you haven't. I invented it.

16:56.927 --> 16:59.095
Do you want a demonstration?

16:59.597 --> 17:02.140
Oh! Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,

17:02.224 --> 17:04.309
to get the piranha back inside of my...

17:04.393 --> 17:06.895
Mr. Gru,
Mr. Perkins will see you now.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.063
So, all I need

17:09.147 --> 17:12.150
is money from the bank to build a rocket.

17:12.233 --> 17:15.236
And then, the moon is ours. Wow!

17:16.113 --> 17:17.989
Well, very nice presentation.

17:18.073 --> 17:20.325
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

17:20.409 --> 17:23.118
Absolutely! Will do.

17:23.203 --> 17:24.579
Soon as I have it.

17:25.623 --> 17:27.582
You don't have it?

17:27.665 --> 17:31.169
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

17:32.379 --> 17:33.922
Apparently.

17:34.006 --> 17:38.343
Do you have any idea of the capital that
this bank has invested in you, Gru?

17:39.386 --> 17:44.015
With far too few of your sinister
plots actually turning a profit.

17:44.850 --> 17:48.686
How can I put it?
Let's say this apple is you.

17:49.271 --> 17:51.773
If we don't start getting our money back...

17:53.609 --> 17:55.276
Get the picture?

17:56.695 --> 18:00.281
Look, Gru, the point is, there are
a lot of new villains out there,

18:00.616 --> 18:03.409
younger than you, hungrier than you,

18:03.494 --> 18:05.536
younger than you.

18:05.621 --> 18:07.872
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

18:07.957 --> 18:09.624
He just stole a pyramid!

18:14.129 --> 18:16.214
I've got it. I've got it.

18:16.632 --> 18:20.218
Um... So, as far as getting
money for the rocket...

18:20.302 --> 18:23.304
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.

19:52.311 --> 19:53.978
Suckers!

19:59.401 --> 20:00.735
Suckers!

20:07.659 --> 20:08.951
Ah-ha! We got it!

20:16.001 --> 20:17.126
What?

20:17.211 --> 20:20.004
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

20:21.757 --> 20:22.757
No, no, no!

20:26.303 --> 20:27.470
You!

20:30.432 --> 20:34.185
Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!

20:34.269 --> 20:36.104
So long, Gru!

20:37.815 --> 20:39.440
Quick!
We can't let him get away!

20:47.908 --> 20:49.617
Up ahead! Up ahead!

20:50.494 --> 20:52.078
Fire! Fire, now!

21:01.130 --> 21:02.130
Oops, you missed me!

21:02.214 --> 21:04.257
Come to papa!

21:17.479 --> 21:18.813
Take that.

21:20.816 --> 21:23.151
How adorable.

21:23.735 --> 21:25.278
Got you in our sights!

21:25.863 --> 21:28.281
Like taking candy from a...

21:28.365 --> 21:29.365
What?

21:30.367 --> 21:32.493
Ha! Hey, Gru!

21:32.578 --> 21:35.705
Try this on for size!

21:37.166 --> 21:39.876
That's weird. What is going...

21:44.965 --> 21:46.841
This is claustrophobic!

21:48.218 --> 21:49.635
No, no, no!

21:55.475 --> 21:57.894
Too small!
This is too small for me!

22:04.276 --> 22:06.027
I hate that guy!

22:12.826 --> 22:14.827
And please watch over us,

22:14.912 --> 22:16.871
and bless that we'll have a
good night's sleep.

22:16.955 --> 22:18.456
And bless that while we're sleeping,

22:18.540 --> 22:20.958
no bugs will crawl into our ears

22:21.043 --> 22:23.377
and lay eggs in our brains.

22:23.712 --> 22:26.339
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.

22:26.965 --> 22:29.717
And please bless that someone
will adopt us soon,

22:29.801 --> 22:32.720
and that the mommy and daddy will be nice

22:32.804 --> 22:34.722
and have a pet unicorn.

22:35.140 --> 22:36.349
Amen.

22:36.433 --> 22:38.226
Amen. Amen.

22:43.023 --> 22:46.317
Unicorns, I love them Unicorns, I love them

22:46.401 --> 22:50.154
Uni, uni, unicorns I love them

22:50.822 --> 22:53.866
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one

22:54.243 --> 22:56.327
If they were really real

22:56.411 --> 22:57.495
And they are

22:57.579 --> 23:00.164
So, I bought one
so I could pet it

23:00.582 --> 23:03.459
Now it loves me Now I love it

23:03.543 --> 23:05.544
La, la, la, la, la

24:20.245 --> 24:22.621
Don't you... What the...

24:52.486 --> 24:54.320
Oh, good luck, little girls!

24:59.534 --> 25:01.702
Whoa! Cool.

25:02.788 --> 25:06.832
Hi! We're orphans from Miss
Hattie's Home for Girls.

25:06.917 --> 25:08.876
I don't care. Beat it! Come on!

25:08.960 --> 25:12.213
We're selling cookies so, you know,
we can have a better future.

25:12.297 --> 25:15.132
Ooh! Wait, wait! Do you have
coco-nutties? Yeah.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.406
Light bulb.

25:42.494 --> 25:43.828
Dr. Nefario! Huh?

25:43.912 --> 25:47.164
I'm going to need a dozen tiny
robots disguised as cookies!

25:47.249 --> 25:49.208
What? Cookie robots!

25:49.292 --> 25:51.710
Who is this? Oh, forget it.

25:58.343 --> 26:01.137
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,

26:01.680 --> 26:03.430
Dr. Gru.

26:06.184 --> 26:08.853
Oh! And I see you have made a list

26:08.937 --> 26:12.690
of some of your personal achievements.

26:13.024 --> 26:15.609
Thank you for that.
I love reading.

26:23.368 --> 26:25.828
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

26:25.912 --> 26:28.038
and a knighthood.

26:30.417 --> 26:31.917
Me, me, me. Me, me, me.

26:32.002 --> 26:33.002
Kevin?

26:34.963 --> 26:37.047
You had your own cooking show

26:37.132 --> 26:41.093
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

26:41.178 --> 26:42.887
It's not that impressive.

26:42.971 --> 26:43.971
Uh...

26:45.140 --> 26:46.348
Idiot!

26:48.393 --> 26:51.187
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

26:53.148 --> 26:55.524
What in the name of... What?

26:56.693 --> 26:59.904
Well, here's the dealio.

26:59.988 --> 27:04.909
Things have been so lonely since my wife,

27:06.828 --> 27:09.246
Debbie, passed on.

27:09.331 --> 27:12.499
It's like my heart is a tooth,

27:13.126 --> 27:18.005
and it's got a cavity that can only
be filled with children.

27:18.423 --> 27:19.590
I'm sorry.

27:24.012 --> 27:27.181
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

27:27.682 --> 27:30.059
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

27:31.937 --> 27:35.481
You have a face como un burro.

27:37.776 --> 27:38.943
Oh!

27:39.027 --> 27:41.528
Well, thank you!

27:43.031 --> 27:46.700
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?

27:46.785 --> 27:48.369
So, so excited!

27:50.288 --> 27:53.666
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

27:56.711 --> 27:58.420
I bet the mom is beautiful!

27:58.505 --> 28:00.631
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

28:00.715 --> 28:03.550
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.

28:04.511 --> 28:06.804
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

28:07.222 --> 28:11.141
Aw! My caterpillar never turned
into a butterfly.

28:11.226 --> 28:12.768
That's a Cheeto.

28:12.852 --> 28:13.894
Oh!

28:16.064 --> 28:19.566
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

28:21.945 --> 28:23.320
Who's Debbie?

28:23.405 --> 28:25.239
Your wife.

28:25.323 --> 28:26.824
Oh! Hi, girls!

28:36.876 --> 28:39.670
Girls, I want you to meet Mr. Gru.

28:41.089 --> 28:43.090
He's going to adopt you.

28:43.174 --> 28:45.759
And he's a dentist!

28:48.096 --> 28:49.430
Yeah!

28:51.641 --> 28:53.058
Um...

28:53.143 --> 28:57.521
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

28:58.106 --> 28:59.898
And that's Agnes.

28:59.983 --> 29:01.942
I got your leg, I got your leg!

29:02.027 --> 29:05.112
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

29:05.196 --> 29:07.531
Let go of my leg. Come on.
You can do it. Higher!

29:07.615 --> 29:09.908
Higher! Just release your grip. Wow!

29:10.201 --> 29:13.370
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

29:13.455 --> 29:15.414
Some nonstick spray?

29:17.042 --> 29:19.293
Crowbar?

29:20.378 --> 29:23.047
Okay, girls, let's go.

29:43.943 --> 29:46.111
Ah-ha!

29:46.905 --> 29:48.322
Oh, yeah!

29:50.700 --> 29:52.701
Pretty impressive!

29:53.995 --> 29:55.954
What are you looking at?

29:56.039 --> 29:57.331
Boo-ya!

29:59.501 --> 30:01.502
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

30:02.128 --> 30:03.170
Take that!

30:04.297 --> 30:05.631
You done been shrunk!

30:06.925 --> 30:08.133
Yello?

30:08.968 --> 30:11.011
I got the shrink ray, all right.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.681
No, I'm not playing with it.

30:14.766 --> 30:17.142
Gru?

30:18.061 --> 30:19.895
Don't make me laugh! No.

30:20.397 --> 30:22.940
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

30:23.024 --> 30:26.068
and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,

30:26.194 --> 30:27.694
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

30:29.781 --> 30:31.031
Okay, bye.

30:32.158 --> 30:37.079
Aw! Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

30:38.498 --> 30:40.374
Curse you, tiny toilet!

30:45.004 --> 30:47.089
Okay, here we are.

30:47.173 --> 30:48.715
Home sweet home.

30:51.219 --> 30:54.096
So, this is, like, your house?

30:54.889 --> 30:56.181
Wait a sec...

30:56.266 --> 30:59.017
You're the guy who pretended
he was a recorded message!

30:59.102 --> 31:01.103
No, that was someone else.

31:14.659 --> 31:15.951
Can I hold your hand?

31:16.744 --> 31:17.744
Uh, no.

31:28.047 --> 31:30.215
When we got adopted by a bald guy,

31:30.300 --> 31:32.926
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

31:41.853 --> 31:43.145
No, hey!

31:47.233 --> 31:50.402
Kyle, these are not treats.
These are guests.

31:50.486 --> 31:53.113
Girls, this is Kyle, my

31:53.198 --> 31:54.239
dog.

31:56.826 --> 31:58.160
Ooh! Fluffy doggy!

32:03.625 --> 32:04.750
What kind of dog is that?

32:04.834 --> 32:07.461
He is a... I don't know.

32:08.338 --> 32:11.548
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

32:12.050 --> 32:13.717
'Cause it's not.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.137
No! No! Stay away from there!

32:17.222 --> 32:18.805
It's fragile.

32:21.351 --> 32:24.811
Well, I suppose the plan will
work with two.

32:24.896 --> 32:27.689
Hey! It's dark in here.

32:30.568 --> 32:32.945
It poked a hole in my juice box.

32:37.909 --> 32:39.159
As you can see,

32:39.244 --> 32:42.746
I have provided everything
a child might need.

32:44.624 --> 32:45.624
All right.

32:45.959 --> 32:49.211
Uh... Okay. As I was saying...
Hey!

32:50.421 --> 32:51.463
Somebody broke that.

32:51.923 --> 32:55.592
Okay, okay. Clearly,
we need to set some rules.

32:55.677 --> 32:57.511
Rule number one.

32:57.595 --> 33:00.138
You will not touch anything.

33:00.223 --> 33:02.099
Uh-huh. What about the floor?

33:02.517 --> 33:04.559
Yes, you may touch the floor.

33:04.644 --> 33:06.019
What about the air?

33:06.104 --> 33:08.188
Yes, you may touch the air!

33:08.273 --> 33:09.314
What about this?

33:12.485 --> 33:14.444
Where did you get that?
Found it.

33:14.529 --> 33:18.282
Okay. Rule number two. You will not
bother me while I'm working.

33:18.366 --> 33:20.284
Rule number three.

33:20.368 --> 33:24.830
You will not cry or whin or laugh or giggle

33:25.164 --> 33:27.541
or sneeze or burp or fart!

33:28.209 --> 33:32.546
So, no, no, no annoying sounds.
All right?

33:32.630 --> 33:34.464
Does this count as annoying?

33:38.219 --> 33:39.386
Very!

33:41.889 --> 33:44.474
I will see you in six hours.

33:46.561 --> 33:50.480
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

33:51.107 --> 33:55.485
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

33:56.904 --> 33:58.113
Mmm?

34:23.264 --> 34:27.059
Uh, question. What are these?

34:27.976 --> 34:32.438
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

34:32.523 --> 34:34.524
Look at this. Watch me!

34:38.446 --> 34:41.114
Cookie robots.
I said cookie robots.

34:41.699 --> 34:44.284
Why are you so old?

34:46.746 --> 34:48.371
Okay. I'm on it.

34:49.290 --> 34:50.623
Hello?

35:06.307 --> 35:07.557
TV!

35:27.412 --> 35:28.412
What is that?

35:28.496 --> 35:29.704
Wow! Look at that!

35:29.789 --> 35:31.248
That is cool!

35:32.083 --> 35:33.375
Come on!

35:33.876 --> 35:36.169
I don't think he's a dentist.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.810
We've been working
on this for a while.

35:51.894 --> 35:54.688
It's a anti-gravity serum.

36:00.403 --> 36:03.780
I meant to close that. He'll be
all right, I'm sure.

36:03.865 --> 36:05.407
Do the effects wear off?

36:05.491 --> 36:06.950
Uh, so far,

36:07.034 --> 36:09.035
no. No, they don't.

36:10.580 --> 36:13.665
And here, of course, is the new
weapon you ordered.

36:17.336 --> 36:18.336
No, no.

36:18.379 --> 36:22.257
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.

36:22.884 --> 36:25.635
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

36:25.720 --> 36:28.305
under what circumstances would we use this?

36:28.389 --> 36:29.848
But, anyway.

36:29.932 --> 36:33.393
What I really wanted to show you was this.

36:38.149 --> 36:41.276
Now those are cookie robots!

36:42.403 --> 36:45.655
La, la, la, la I love unicorns

36:45.740 --> 36:49.409
What are you doing here? I told you
to stay in the kitchen!

36:49.494 --> 36:52.078
We got bored.
What is this place?

36:52.330 --> 36:53.997
Can I drink this?

36:54.081 --> 36:56.541
Do you want to explode?

36:58.169 --> 36:59.169
Gru!

36:59.253 --> 37:01.254
Get back in the kitchen!

37:01.339 --> 37:03.465
Will you play with us? No.

37:03.883 --> 37:06.092
Why? Because I'm busy.

37:06.177 --> 37:07.719
Doing what?

37:07.803 --> 37:09.095
Um...

37:09.180 --> 37:10.764
Okay, okay, you got me.

37:10.848 --> 37:13.600
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

37:14.185 --> 37:16.603
In real life, I am a spy.

37:17.104 --> 37:20.232
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

37:20.316 --> 37:22.442
because if you do...
What does this do?

37:26.822 --> 37:27.822
Hey! Oops.

37:28.282 --> 37:29.741
My unicorn!

37:30.076 --> 37:31.701
You have to fix it.

37:31.786 --> 37:34.704
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.

37:34.789 --> 37:37.123
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

37:42.421 --> 37:44.547
That's freaking me out.
What is she doing?

37:44.632 --> 37:47.842
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

37:49.220 --> 37:51.471
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

37:54.892 --> 37:57.018
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

37:57.436 --> 37:59.396
Tim! Mark! Phil!

38:02.066 --> 38:03.275
This is very important.

38:03.359 --> 38:06.903
You have to get the little
girl a new unicorn toy.

38:06.988 --> 38:07.988
Eh?

38:12.952 --> 38:14.828
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

38:15.997 --> 38:18.081
Go, and hurry!

38:18.165 --> 38:19.374
What are those?

38:19.458 --> 38:22.627
They are my cousins.

38:23.462 --> 38:25.005
Jerry! Stuart!

38:26.090 --> 38:29.092
Watch them, and keep them
away from me, please.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.737
Wow!

39:10.926 --> 39:12.052
Ooh!

39:25.107 --> 39:26.107
Oh!

39:26.192 --> 39:27.400
Hmm...

39:53.761 --> 39:54.928
It was your cousin's idea.

39:55.304 --> 39:56.429
What?

39:56.847 --> 39:58.348
Okay, bedtime.

39:58.432 --> 39:59.766
Aw!

40:00.184 --> 40:01.351
Aw! Aw!

40:01.644 --> 40:03.061
Not you two!

40:04.647 --> 40:09.359
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.071
Just so you know,

40:13.155 --> 40:14.989
you're never gonna be my dad.

40:15.074 --> 40:17.826
Hmm. I think I can live with that.

40:19.495 --> 40:21.329
Are these beds made out of bombs?

40:21.872 --> 40:26.042
Yes, but they are very old and
highly unlikely to blow up.

40:26.961 --> 40:28.962
But try not to toss and turn.

40:29.046 --> 40:30.213
Cool.

40:31.132 --> 40:34.300
- Will you read us a bedtime story?
- No.

40:34.385 --> 40:37.470
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

40:37.555 --> 40:41.182
Well, then it's going to be a
long night for you, isn't it?

40:41.976 --> 40:45.603
So, good night, sleep tight, and
don't let the bed bugs bite.

40:45.688 --> 40:49.607
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

40:50.651 --> 40:53.820
And there's
probably something in your closet.

40:55.406 --> 40:57.574
He's just kidding, Agnes.

41:14.967 --> 41:16.776
Para tu... Papoy

41:19.805 --> 41:21.723
It's beautiful.

41:50.127 --> 41:52.587
Girls, let's go.

41:52.671 --> 41:55.507
Time to deliver the cookies!

41:55.591 --> 41:59.135
Mmm. Okay. But first,
we're going to dance class.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.138
Actually, we're going to have
to skip the dance class today.

42:02.223 --> 42:04.057
Actually, we can't

42:04.141 --> 42:06.768
Skip the dance class today.

42:06.852 --> 42:08.811
We have a big recital coming up.

42:08.896 --> 42:10.730
We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.

42:10.814 --> 42:12.148
Yeah, Swan Lake!

42:12.233 --> 42:13.983
That's fantastic. Wonderful.

42:14.068 --> 42:18.196
But we're going to deliver cookies!
Come on!

42:20.366 --> 42:21.366
No.

42:22.243 --> 42:23.284
No?

42:23.369 --> 42:26.621
We're not going to deliver
cookies until we do dance class.

42:26.705 --> 42:27.830
Really?

42:27.915 --> 42:31.626
Well, I am not driving you
to dance class.

42:31.710 --> 42:37.090
So if you want to go, you are
going to have to walk yourselves.

42:43.180 --> 42:44.430
What are you doing?

42:44.515 --> 42:46.307
Walking to dance class.

42:46.392 --> 42:48.351
Ya? Okay, fine.

42:48.435 --> 42:52.272
You just keep walking, because
I'm really not driving you!

42:52.356 --> 42:53.565
Okay.

42:55.067 --> 42:57.569
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!

42:58.028 --> 43:00.029
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

43:00.114 --> 43:02.073
And you had better be in this car!

43:02.157 --> 43:05.827
Here we go! One! Two!

43:05.911 --> 43:09.497
Three, four and five.

43:09.582 --> 43:12.458
And lift, and stretch.

43:12.543 --> 43:15.169
And one, and two...

43:15.254 --> 43:17.380
Here you go. What is it?

43:17.464 --> 43:21.009
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

43:21.093 --> 43:22.719
Of course, of course.

43:22.803 --> 43:25.888
I have pins and needles
that I'm sitting on.

43:25.973 --> 43:27.640
Pinky promise?

43:29.101 --> 43:32.312
Oh, yes. My pinky promises.

43:45.492 --> 43:50.163
All right. Our first customer
is a man named Vector.

43:50.247 --> 43:51.998
But he's a V.

43:52.082 --> 43:54.083
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

43:54.168 --> 43:56.085
Then we go to the B's.
Then we...

43:56.170 --> 43:58.588
Yes, yes!
I went to kindergarten.

43:58.672 --> 44:01.090
I know how the alphabet works!

44:03.677 --> 44:06.346
I was just thinking

44:06.430 --> 44:10.183
that it might be nice to
deliver Mr. Vector's first.

44:10.267 --> 44:11.934
That is all.

44:15.189 --> 44:17.690
Almost over. It's almost over.

44:19.818 --> 44:24.072
Girls, welcome back to the fortress
of Vector-tude!

44:25.032 --> 44:27.533
Do you have my cookies for me?

44:35.292 --> 44:37.210
Four boxes of mini-mints,
two toffee totes,

44:37.294 --> 44:42.006
two caramel clumpies and
fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

44:42.091 --> 44:45.677
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody
else order that many cookies.

44:45.761 --> 44:46.803
Not likely.

44:46.887 --> 44:48.971
Name one person who ordered
more cookies than me.

44:49.223 --> 44:50.765
That'll be $52.

44:51.350 --> 44:52.642
Right.

45:00.192 --> 45:02.902
Seven, eight, nine...

45:03.821 --> 45:06.364
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

45:06.448 --> 45:09.659
Seven, eight, nine...

45:09.743 --> 45:11.536
Why are you wearing pajamas?

45:11.620 --> 45:15.915
These aren't pajamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

45:32.599 --> 45:34.976
What are you warming up for?
Stuff.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.060
What sort of stuff?

45:36.145 --> 45:38.563
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.

45:38.647 --> 45:40.064
Like sleeping?

45:40.149 --> 45:43.067
They are not pajamas!

45:54.913 --> 45:58.124
Here you go, 52 big ones.

46:16.226 --> 46:17.685
Bye!

47:11.615 --> 47:12.990
Come on!

47:35.055 --> 47:36.889
What the...

47:39.726 --> 47:41.394
Quiet down, fish!

47:48.402 --> 47:49.443
Down, boy!

48:11.091 --> 48:12.508
Ah-ha!

48:12.593 --> 48:15.928
We did it!
Come on, girls, let's go!

48:23.812 --> 48:26.897
But what about the other
people who ordered cookies?

48:26.982 --> 48:29.692
Life is full of disappointments

48:29.776 --> 48:32.528
for some people.

48:37.284 --> 48:38.784
Don't do that!

48:38.869 --> 48:41.912
Super Silly Fun Land!
Can we go? Please?

48:42.331 --> 48:43.372
No.

48:43.457 --> 48:45.958
But we've never been. And it's
the funnest place on earth!

48:46.043 --> 48:47.084
Don't care.

48:47.169 --> 48:48.294
Please? Please?

48:48.378 --> 48:50.046
We'll never ask for
anything else, ever again!

48:50.130 --> 48:52.173
Pretty please? Please?

48:59.306 --> 49:01.265
Come on! Come on!

49:01.808 --> 49:03.976
Light bulb.

49:08.899 --> 49:10.691
Come on!

49:10.776 --> 49:13.736
Goodbye, have fun.

49:17.157 --> 49:20.701
Sorry, dude. They can't
ride without an adult.

49:20.786 --> 49:22.161
What?

50:18.677 --> 50:20.094
Oh, my gosh!

50:20.178 --> 50:22.596
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

50:25.350 --> 50:27.643
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

50:27.728 --> 50:29.145
You've gotta let us play for it!

50:29.229 --> 50:30.980
No, no, no.

50:31.064 --> 50:32.356
Come on!

50:33.900 --> 50:36.444
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

50:37.654 --> 50:39.530
Well, it is not for sale.

50:39.614 --> 50:41.532
But all you gotta do to win it

50:41.616 --> 50:44.618
is knock down that little spaceship there.

50:45.495 --> 50:46.620
It's easy!

50:55.005 --> 50:56.255
Yay!

51:08.268 --> 51:09.435
Again!

51:10.187 --> 51:12.605
Wait! Come on. One more time!

51:12.689 --> 51:13.856
Just one more.

51:13.940 --> 51:16.317
I accidentally closed my eyes.

51:31.666 --> 51:33.667
I hit it! I hit it!
That was cool.

51:35.337 --> 51:36.545
Aw!

51:38.131 --> 51:41.008
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

51:41.760 --> 51:44.845
She hit that. I saw
that with my own eyes.

51:44.930 --> 51:47.681
Hey, buddy, let me explain
something to you.

51:47.766 --> 51:50.017
You see that little tin spaceship?

51:50.101 --> 51:52.269
You see how it's not knocked over?

51:52.354 --> 51:55.231
Do you know what that means, professor?

51:55.315 --> 51:58.818
It means you don't get the unicorn!

51:58.902 --> 52:00.903
Oh! Uh-oh!

52:00.987 --> 52:02.822
Somebody's got a frowny face.

52:02.906 --> 52:05.324
Boo! Better luck next time!

52:07.577 --> 52:10.287
Okay, my turn.

52:31.685 --> 52:34.228
Knocked over!

52:38.567 --> 52:40.359
It's so fluffy!

52:40.443 --> 52:41.443
Yeah!

52:42.112 --> 52:44.196
That was awesome!

52:44.281 --> 52:45.948
You blew up the whole thing!

52:46.032 --> 52:48.409
Let's go. Let's try another game!

52:55.458 --> 52:57.876
Gru, do you mind
if I have a quick word?

52:58.628 --> 53:00.879
Okay, girls, go play.

53:08.430 --> 53:10.723
I got the shrink ray!

53:13.351 --> 53:15.561
Cotton candy!

53:16.563 --> 53:20.482
We have 12 days until the
moon is in optimum position.

53:20.567 --> 53:22.735
We can't afford any distractions!

53:24.487 --> 53:25.738
Get me Perkins.

53:31.911 --> 53:33.078
Ah-ha!

53:33.747 --> 53:35.873
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Perkins,

53:35.957 --> 53:39.960
but I figured that you
would want to see this!

53:40.754 --> 53:41.879
What?

53:54.392 --> 53:55.768
Well done, Gru.

53:55.852 --> 53:56.852
Rather impressive.

53:56.936 --> 53:59.938
Now, the rest
of the plan is simple.

54:00.607 --> 54:04.360
I fly to the moon.
I shrink the moon.

54:04.444 --> 54:08.155
I grab the moon.
I sit on the toilet.

54:08.239 --> 54:09.865
What?

54:09.949 --> 54:12.034
Sorry. Sorry!

54:12.118 --> 54:15.245
Could you excuse me for just one second?

54:15.330 --> 54:16.747
I told you not to touch my things.

54:16.831 --> 54:19.875
I told you, I told you. I've
told you a thousand times.

54:19.959 --> 54:21.627
Hey, can we order pizza?

54:21.711 --> 54:23.629
Pizza? You just had lunch.

54:23.713 --> 54:24.880
Not now, for dinner.

54:24.964 --> 54:26.548
Dinner?

54:26.633 --> 54:29.426
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

54:29.511 --> 54:31.345
Oh! Can we get stuffed crust?

54:32.597 --> 54:33.806
Stuffed crust! Stuffed crust!

54:33.890 --> 54:35.474
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

54:37.477 --> 54:38.894
You're funny!

54:38.978 --> 54:41.730
Just don't come out of that room again!

54:42.273 --> 54:43.315
All right.

54:44.234 --> 54:47.611
Sorry about that. Where were we?

54:47.696 --> 54:49.279
You were sitting on the toilet.

54:49.364 --> 54:53.909
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry. It
was a little attempt at humor.

54:53.993 --> 54:56.829
I know how much you like to laugh

54:59.290 --> 55:03.127
inside. Now, I was saying...

55:06.715 --> 55:08.632
You don't seem
terribly focused, Gru.

55:08.717 --> 55:11.051
Believe me,
I am completely focused.

55:11.177 --> 55:13.220
Hello! Whoa! What?

55:13.304 --> 55:14.430
That guy is huge!

55:14.514 --> 55:15.931
Are we on TV?
What are those? Children?

55:16.015 --> 55:18.851
What are you doing? I told
you to stay out of here!

55:24.065 --> 55:25.274
No, no, no!

55:25.358 --> 55:26.442
Freeze ray!

55:26.526 --> 55:28.110
Mr. Gru?

55:32.866 --> 55:34.199
Okay.

55:35.577 --> 55:36.952
As I was saying...

55:37.036 --> 55:40.873
No need to continue.
I've seen quite enough.

55:40.957 --> 55:42.124
But my plan...

55:42.208 --> 55:43.292
Is a great plan.

55:43.376 --> 55:46.587
I love everything about your
plan, except for one thing.

55:47.464 --> 55:48.797
You.

55:52.051 --> 55:55.637
Look, Mom, I drew a picture
of me landing on the moon!

55:58.725 --> 56:02.770
Look, Mom, I made a prototype
of the rocket out of macaroni!

56:05.398 --> 56:07.357
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket

56:07.442 --> 56:09.777
based on the macaroni prototype!

56:21.039 --> 56:22.790
I don't understand.

56:23.124 --> 56:25.417
Let's face reality, Gru.

56:25.502 --> 56:30.255
You've been at this for far too
long with far too little success.

56:30.465 --> 56:34.676
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...

56:35.512 --> 56:37.137
Well, a younger villain.

56:37.222 --> 56:38.680
But I...

56:38.765 --> 56:40.891
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

57:02.121 --> 57:06.625
Now, I know there have been
some rumors going around

57:06.709 --> 57:10.003
that the bank is no longer funding us.

57:10.880 --> 57:13.674
Well, I am here to put those
rumors to rest.

57:15.802 --> 57:17.719
They are true.

57:17.804 --> 57:19.596
Uh-oh!

57:19.681 --> 57:21.890
In terms of money,

57:23.059 --> 57:25.227
we have no money.

57:25.311 --> 57:27.896
So how will we get to the moon?

57:29.065 --> 57:30.899
The answer is clear.

57:30.984 --> 57:32.568
We won't.

57:35.613 --> 57:37.906
We are doomed.

57:39.158 --> 57:41.743
Now would probably be a good time

57:41.828 --> 57:43.745
to look for other employment options.

57:45.665 --> 57:46.748
I know.

57:46.833 --> 57:52.087
I have fired up my resume as I
suggest that all of you do, as well.

57:53.089 --> 57:54.673
What is it?

57:56.593 --> 57:59.887
Can't you see that I am in
the middle of a pep talk?

58:29.542 --> 58:30.918
Yes!

58:31.002 --> 58:33.921
Yes, we will build our own rocket

58:34.547 --> 58:38.091
using this and whatever
else we can find!

58:38.551 --> 58:42.179
Grab everything! Hit the junkyards!
Take apart the cars!

58:42.680 --> 58:44.556
Who needs the bank?

58:44.641 --> 58:46.391
Let's go. Let's go!

59:36.359 --> 59:38.652
Mom! What are you doing here?

59:38.736 --> 59:41.571
And here he is in the bathtub.

59:41.739 --> 59:43.949
Oh! Look at his little buns.

59:46.285 --> 59:47.744
Mom.

59:47.829 --> 59:49.246
Not cool.

59:50.248 --> 59:54.793
And here, he's all dressed
up in his Sunday best.

59:55.461 --> 59:57.087
He looks like a girl!

59:57.171 --> 01:00:00.924
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:25.323
You're funny!

01:00:38.838 --> 01:00:41.798
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

01:00:59.901 --> 01:01:02.444
Mr. Perkins, your son is here.

01:01:02.528 --> 01:01:04.362
Send him in.

01:01:05.531 --> 01:01:07.199
Hey, Dad.

01:01:08.034 --> 01:01:09.451
You wanted to see me?

01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:10.952
Yes, I did, Victor.

01:01:11.037 --> 01:01:12.537
I am not Victor anymore.

01:01:12.622 --> 01:01:16.083
Victor was my nerd name.
Now I am Vector!

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:17.501
Sit down!

01:01:19.128 --> 01:01:21.546
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

01:01:21.964 --> 01:01:23.924
Duh! Back at my place.

01:01:24.008 --> 01:01:26.843
Oh, is that right? Back at your place?
Oh, that's cool.

01:01:26.928 --> 01:01:31.223
I guess Gru must just have one
that looks exactly like it!

01:01:33.226 --> 01:01:37.062
Oh! What the...
Those girls sold me cookies!

01:01:37.355 --> 01:01:41.108
Do you have any idea how lucrative
this moon heist could be?

01:01:41.192 --> 01:01:42.984
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,

01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:44.736
and you just blow it!

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.281
No, I didn't.

01:01:48.366 --> 01:01:49.407
Oh, really?

01:01:49.492 --> 01:01:52.327
You just wait until Gru sees
my latest weapon.

01:01:52.411 --> 01:01:55.455
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.544
There's a squid on my face!

01:02:02.129 --> 01:02:03.421
Don't worry.

01:02:03.506 --> 01:02:06.758
The moon is as good as ours.

01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:11.096
Come on now, it's bedtime.

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.807
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

01:02:14.976 --> 01:02:16.351
You did not!

01:02:16.435 --> 01:02:20.522
Put on your PJs. Hold still.
Okay, seriously! Seriously!

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:23.400
This is beddie-bye time,
right now.

01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:25.110
I'm not kidding around.
I mean it!

01:02:25.194 --> 01:02:26.528
But we're not tired!

01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:27.904
Well, I am tired.

01:02:27.989 --> 01:02:30.240
Will you read us a bedtime story?

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.495
No.

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.830
Pretty please!

01:02:36.914 --> 01:02:40.709
The physical appearance of the
"please" makes no difference.

01:02:40.793 --> 01:02:42.878
It is still no, so go to sleep.

01:02:42.962 --> 01:02:45.088
But we can't. We're all hyper!

01:02:45.172 --> 01:02:49.718
And without a bedtime story, we'll
just keep getting up and bugging you.

01:02:49.802 --> 01:02:50.886
All night long.

01:02:52.346 --> 01:02:54.306
Fine.

01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:58.351
All right, all right.
Sleepy Kittens.

01:02:58.811 --> 01:03:00.145
Sleepy Kittens?

01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:01.980
- What are these?
- Puppets.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.733
You use them when you tell the story.

01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:14.367
Okay, let's get this over with.

01:03:14.869 --> 01:03:16.745
"Three little kittens loved to play,

01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:19.080
"they had fun in the sun all day.

01:03:19.165 --> 01:03:21.499
"Then their mother came out and said,

01:03:21.584 --> 01:03:23.585
"'Time for kittens to go to bed."'

01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:27.589
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:28.965
Keep reading!

01:03:30.134 --> 01:03:32.177
Come on! All right,
all right, all right.

01:03:32.428 --> 01:03:34.930
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

01:03:35.014 --> 01:03:37.390
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'

01:03:37.475 --> 01:03:40.018
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,

01:03:40.102 --> 01:03:43.772
"'Fine, but at least you should
brush your fur."'

01:03:43.856 --> 01:03:46.024
Now you brush the fur.

01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:49.444
This is literature?

01:03:49.528 --> 01:03:52.822
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:56.368
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed

01:03:56.452 --> 01:03:59.871
"said, 'We can't sleep,
we feel too rushed! '

01:03:59.956 --> 01:04:03.041
"Their mother replied, with
a voice like silk,

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:06.002
"'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk."'

01:04:06.087 --> 01:04:08.463
Now make them drink the milk.

01:04:12.802 --> 01:04:16.638
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:20.058
"Three little kittens,
with milk all gone,

01:04:20.142 --> 01:04:23.103
"rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.

01:04:29.485 --> 01:04:32.362
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.'

01:04:32.446 --> 01:04:35.281
"Then their mother sang a lullaby.

01:04:35.366 --> 01:04:38.785
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:41.121
"Sleep in peace until you rise.

01:04:41.706 --> 01:04:44.874
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,

01:04:44.959 --> 01:04:49.754
"'your mommy loves you
with all her heart."'

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:56.094
The end. Okay, good night.

01:04:56.846 --> 01:04:57.846
Wait!

01:04:58.139 --> 01:04:59.347
What?

01:04:59.432 --> 01:05:01.182
What about good night kisses?

01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:07.022
No, no. There will be no kissing
or hugging or kissing.

01:05:09.942 --> 01:05:12.527
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.

01:05:13.154 --> 01:05:15.196
I like him. He's nice.

01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:16.614
But scary.

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:19.159
Like Santa!

01:05:37.678 --> 01:05:41.890
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

01:05:43.142 --> 01:05:45.810
Uh... About that,

01:05:46.312 --> 01:05:50.565
I was thinking that maybe we could
move the date of the heist.

01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:53.151
Please tell me this is not as a result

01:05:53.235 --> 01:05:56.237
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

01:05:56.322 --> 01:05:58.573
No, no, no!

01:05:58.657 --> 01:06:01.701
The recital? Don't...
That's stupid!

01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:06.664
I just think it's kind of
weird to do it on a Saturday.

01:06:06.749 --> 01:06:12.378
I was thinking, maybe a heist
is a Tuesday thing, right?

01:06:13.089 --> 01:06:16.716
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

01:06:16.801 --> 01:06:18.843
It's everything we've dreamed of.

01:06:18.928 --> 01:06:20.845
Your chance to make history,

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:24.140
become the man
who stole the moon!

01:06:24.225 --> 01:06:28.061
But these girls are becoming
a major distraction!

01:06:28.145 --> 01:06:29.479
They need to go.

01:06:30.189 --> 01:06:34.234
If you don't do something
about it, then I will.

01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:37.529
I understand.

01:06:40.074 --> 01:06:41.533
Good.

01:06:44.703 --> 01:06:45.870
Butt.

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:50.291
Butt.

01:07:02.847 --> 01:07:04.013
Butt.

01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:09.644
All right. Now, when
we put our cups together,

01:07:09.728 --> 01:07:12.355
we will make the "clink"
sound with our mouths.

01:07:12.439 --> 01:07:13.648
Ready? Edith?

01:07:13.732 --> 01:07:14.732
Clink. Clink.

01:07:14.817 --> 01:07:16.860
There we go. And now we drink.

01:07:17.611 --> 01:07:18.653
And Agnes?

01:07:18.737 --> 01:07:19.737
Clink. Clink.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:21.197
Very good!

01:07:22.992 --> 01:07:23.992
Excuse me, girls.

01:07:24.076 --> 01:07:25.827
Come on!

01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:29.372
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Keep clinking.

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:31.515
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

01:07:32.126 --> 01:07:33.376
Oh!

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.336
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:37.463
I'm here for the girls.
I received a call

01:07:37.548 --> 01:07:39.340
that you wanted to return them.

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:46.180
And also, I did purchase
a Spanish dictionary.

01:07:49.602 --> 01:07:50.768
I didn't like what you said.

01:07:50.895 --> 01:07:52.270
But...

01:07:56.275 --> 01:07:57.275
Oh!

01:07:58.569 --> 01:08:01.154
I will get the girls ready.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.499
Don't let her take us, Mr. Gru!

01:08:14.752 --> 01:08:16.627
Tell her you wanna keep us.

01:08:16.712 --> 01:08:18.712
All right, girls.
Come on, let's go.

01:08:18.796 --> 01:08:21.299
Goodbye, Mr. Gru.
Thanks for everything.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:39.484
I did it for your own good.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:42.946
Come on, let's go get that moon.

01:08:44.782 --> 01:08:45.865
Right.

01:10:02.443 --> 01:10:03.568
What is this for?

01:10:05.237 --> 01:10:06.487
The recital?

01:10:06.572 --> 01:10:09.866
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:14.037
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:39.812
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

01:10:39.897 --> 01:10:44.901
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.

01:10:45.986 --> 01:10:50.406
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:51.574
six...

01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:18.893
Oh, yeah!

01:11:20.854 --> 01:11:23.397
Nice work, Doctor.
All systems go.

01:11:23.816 --> 01:11:24.899
Boo-ya!

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:37.745
My flight suit.

01:11:39.498 --> 01:11:42.667
Oh, yeah!
Once again, the mighty...

01:12:44.646 --> 01:12:46.814
Whoa!

01:13:05.792 --> 01:13:07.418
Ah-ha!

01:13:07.502 --> 01:13:09.212
I've got it!

01:13:10.714 --> 01:13:13.507
I've got the moon!

01:13:13.592 --> 01:13:16.427
I've got the moon!

01:13:31.526 --> 01:13:33.027
I can make it!

01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:41.410
Wait a minute!

01:13:41.495 --> 01:13:42.620
Kevin!

01:13:45.749 --> 01:13:47.291
Come on, come on!

01:13:55.592 --> 01:13:57.176
He's still not here.

01:13:57.261 --> 01:13:59.679
Why would he come?
He gave us up.

01:13:59.763 --> 01:14:01.264
But he pinky promised!

01:14:01.348 --> 01:14:04.100
Girls, girls, places!

01:14:04.184 --> 01:14:07.019
No, we can't start yet! We're
still expecting someone.

01:14:07.104 --> 01:14:09.480
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

01:14:13.318 --> 01:14:15.736
All right.
But just a few more minutes.

01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:17.905
He's not coming, guys.

01:14:21.326 --> 01:14:23.369
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

01:14:25.706 --> 01:14:29.250
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

01:15:04.244 --> 01:15:06.245
Okay, okay. There's the library.

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:08.998
That's Third Street.
The dance studio...

01:15:09.082 --> 01:15:10.541
There! There! There it is!

01:15:47.996 --> 01:15:50.414
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

01:15:50.749 --> 01:15:52.375
Over?

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:31.831
Vector, open up!

01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:36.085
First give me the moon.
Then we'll talk.

01:16:49.641 --> 01:16:50.891
Mr. Gru!

01:16:50.976 --> 01:16:52.143
Zip it, Happy Meal.

01:16:52.227 --> 01:16:53.727
Now, the girls.

01:16:53.812 --> 01:16:58.190
Actually, I think I'll hold on
to them a little while longer.

01:16:58.275 --> 01:16:59.316
No!

01:16:59.401 --> 01:17:02.069
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

01:17:02.779 --> 01:17:04.238
Listen close, you little punk.

01:17:04.322 --> 01:17:07.700
When I get in there, you are
in for a world of pain!

01:17:08.994 --> 01:17:10.828
I'm really scared!

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.125
He is gonna kick your butt.

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:58.292
What? He punched my shark!

01:18:25.028 --> 01:18:26.153
Ha! There he is!

01:18:32.077 --> 01:18:33.327
Hang on, Gru.

01:18:38.667 --> 01:18:39.959
Oh, no!

01:18:43.296 --> 01:18:44.296
Ow?

01:18:50.262 --> 01:18:52.096
Vector has the girls. Go!

01:18:56.101 --> 01:18:57.768
What happened to the ship?
It's big again!

01:18:57.852 --> 01:19:00.604
Not as big as the moon
is going to be! What?

01:19:00.689 --> 01:19:02.565
The larger the mass of an object,

01:19:02.649 --> 01:19:05.734
the quicker the effects
of the shrink ray wear off!

01:19:05.819 --> 01:19:08.779
I call it the Nefario Principle.

01:19:08.863 --> 01:19:10.781
I just came up with it now, actually.

01:19:11.616 --> 01:19:13.075
Oh, no!

01:19:19.124 --> 01:19:20.457
Did you see that?

01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:23.252
Vector! Help! Vector!

01:19:23.336 --> 01:19:24.545
Over here! Hey!

01:19:24.629 --> 01:19:26.297
What are you girls doing back there?

01:19:26.381 --> 01:19:27.423
The moon!

01:19:41.313 --> 01:19:42.438
Ouch!

01:19:43.565 --> 01:19:44.607
Watch out!

01:19:48.445 --> 01:19:50.237
Get as close in as you can.

01:19:51.072 --> 01:19:52.364
You got it.

01:20:08.715 --> 01:20:09.798
Mr. Gru, up here!

01:20:09.883 --> 01:20:10.924
Mr. Gru!

01:20:11.009 --> 01:20:13.052
Okay, girls! Girls!

01:20:13.136 --> 01:20:15.804
- You're going to have to jump.
- Jump?

01:20:15.889 --> 01:20:17.848
Are you insane?

01:20:17.932 --> 01:20:19.350
Don't worry, I will catch you.

01:20:20.268 --> 01:20:21.685
You gave us back!

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:25.939
I know, I know. And it is the
worst mistake I ever made.

01:20:26.524 --> 01:20:28.442
But you have to jump now.

01:20:29.027 --> 01:20:31.111
It'll be okay.

01:20:36.076 --> 01:20:37.117
Okay, girls.

01:20:39.204 --> 01:20:40.704
Jump now!

01:20:45.710 --> 01:20:48.003
Margo, I will catch you.

01:20:48.672 --> 01:20:51.715
And I will never let you go again.

01:21:01.309 --> 01:21:03.310
Not so fast! No!

01:21:03.395 --> 01:21:04.978
Let me go!

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:09.733
Margo!

01:21:10.151 --> 01:21:11.276
Whoa!

01:21:15.532 --> 01:21:17.741
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!

01:21:46.688 --> 01:21:48.188
I got you.

01:22:06.332 --> 01:22:07.458
No!

01:22:24.642 --> 01:22:25.893
Oh, poop.

01:22:26.978 --> 01:22:28.812
This time, good triumphs,

01:22:28.897 --> 01:22:30.230
and the moon has been returned

01:22:30.315 --> 01:22:32.232
to its rightful place in the sky.

01:22:32.317 --> 01:22:37.029
But once again, law enforcement is
baffled, leaving everyone to wonder,

01:22:37.113 --> 01:22:38.906
who is this mysterious hero?

01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:40.949
And what will he do next?

01:22:41.493 --> 01:22:43.243
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

01:22:43.328 --> 01:22:45.204
Come on! We want a story.

01:22:45.288 --> 01:22:47.080
Three sleepy kittens!

01:22:47.165 --> 01:22:51.418
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:56.048
Tonight we are going to read a new book.

01:22:56.132 --> 01:22:58.300
This one is called

01:22:58.384 --> 01:23:02.095
One Big Unicorn by...
Who wrote this?

01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.600
Oh! Me! I wrote it.
Look, it's a puppet book!

01:23:07.393 --> 01:23:09.102
Here, watch this.

01:23:10.271 --> 01:23:11.688
That's the horn!

01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:18.195
This is gonna be the best book ever!

01:23:18.279 --> 01:23:20.656
Not to pat myself on the back,

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.075
but, yes, it probably will be.

01:23:23.159 --> 01:23:24.243
Here we go.

01:23:24.327 --> 01:23:27.287
"One big unicorn, strong and free

01:23:27.372 --> 01:23:30.123
"thought he was happy as he could be.

01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:34.920
"Then three little kittens came around

01:23:35.255 --> 01:23:38.966
"and turned his whole life upside down."

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:40.801
Hey, that one looks like me!

01:23:40.885 --> 01:23:43.011
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

01:23:43.096 --> 01:23:46.890
Any relation to persons living or
dead is completely coincidental.

01:23:50.436 --> 01:23:52.813
"They made him laugh.

01:23:52.897 --> 01:23:55.983
"They made him cry.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.820
"He never should have said goodbye.

01:24:00.655 --> 01:24:05.200
"And now he knows he could never part

01:24:05.285 --> 01:24:07.911
"from those three little kittens

01:24:08.413 --> 01:24:11.331
"that changed his heart.

01:24:11.416 --> 01:24:13.500
"The end."

01:24:13.585 --> 01:24:15.919
Okay, all right. Good night.

01:24:39.235 --> 01:24:40.861
I love you.

01:24:41.404 --> 01:24:43.113
I love you, too.

01:24:52.457 --> 01:24:54.291
No, no!

01:24:56.502 --> 01:24:57.628
All right.

01:25:02.634 --> 01:25:04.092
Didn't I get you already?

01:25:38.628 --> 01:25:40.587
They're very good!

01:25:40.672 --> 01:25:43.632
I'm so proud of you, Son.

01:25:43.716 --> 01:25:46.677
You've turned out to be
a great parent!

01:25:47.845 --> 01:25:49.346
Just like me.

01:25:49.889 --> 01:25:52.140
Maybe even better.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.169
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

01:26:22.922 --> 01:26:24.381
No, no, no!

01:28:04.065 --> 01:28:05.607
Hey, Carl! Hey.

01:28:05.691 --> 01:28:06.691
Hmm?

01:28:09.904 --> 01:28:10.987
No, no, no.

01:28:11.072 --> 01:28:12.280
Me, me, me.

01:28:13.616 --> 01:28:14.616
John?

01:28:14.659 --> 01:28:15.659
No, no. Me, me, me.

01:28:39.934 --> 01:28:41.685
Oh, poop.

01:29:27.106 --> 01:29:28.898
Oh, no!

01:29:29.734 --> 01:29:31.192
Stop! Stop!

01:30:02.224 --> 01:30:03.850
Huh?

01:30:32.421 --> 01:30:33.755
Hello, I am Gru.

01:30:33.839 --> 01:30:36.883
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
