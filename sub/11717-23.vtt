00:13.413 --> 00:15.164
Hey, guys, come in here.

00:15.231 --> 00:16.832
Come on here, listen up.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.067
Our target's name is Wo Fat.

00:18.134 --> 00:20.436
Thermal imaging shows
one heat signature

00:20.503 --> 00:22.404
in the safe house,
so we know he's alone.

00:22.455 --> 00:25.707
Do not let that fool you.
This guy is a major arms dealer,

00:25.759 --> 00:26.809
with known terrorist
affiliations

00:26.876 --> 00:28.210
and over a dozen kills
to his name.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.245
He's more than likely
carrying a weapon,

00:30.296 --> 00:31.914
and he's most definitely
dangerous.

00:31.981 --> 00:33.382
So stay focused.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.951
Be aware of your surroundings at
all times, all right? Let's go.

00:36.919 --> 00:38.954
Gearing up, huh?
Yeah.

00:39.022 --> 00:40.722
Good for you. You forgot
one thing, though.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.609
What are you doing?
What are you doing with those?!

00:43.693 --> 00:45.561
You're not
a field agent, okay?

00:45.628 --> 00:47.129
You're an analyst.
Are you kidding me?

00:47.197 --> 00:48.530
It is my intel that got us here.

00:48.598 --> 00:49.931
I cannot believe you're
going to freeze me out now.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.433
Look, I understand how much
this means to you.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.068
But you're not going to
get hurt on my watch, okay?

00:53.119 --> 00:56.121
Let's go, guys!
Let's go, move out.

01:19.795 --> 01:20.795
Steve, you all right?!

01:24.818 --> 01:26.401
Break contact!

01:26.469 --> 01:27.236
Barricade! Gunshots fired!

01:27.303 --> 01:28.237
Copy that.

01:28.304 --> 01:29.655
Entry team, fall back!

01:32.525 --> 01:34.476
Boss, he's on the move!

01:34.527 --> 01:38.113
I'm going in! Stay here.
Surround the perimeter.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.182
KONO I'm have him
heading toward the back of the house.

01:49.209 --> 01:50.158
Boss, he's moving upstairs!

02:22.858 --> 02:25.294
I got eyes on the target,
but it's not Wo Fat.

02:25.361 --> 02:26.411
It's Sang Min.

02:29.866 --> 02:31.133
Please repeat.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.702
I say again: Sang Min.

02:33.803 --> 02:34.836
Wo Fat wasn't in the house.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.123
Kaye, get down!

03:02.465 --> 03:03.999
You all right?

03:04.067 --> 03:06.768
Stay here. Please. Okay?

03:22.819 --> 03:23.885
Hi, I got him.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.187
He just went into a house

03:25.255 --> 03:27.055
three doors down
from the safe house.

04:05.228 --> 04:07.262
All right... he's in
a white Cadillac sedan.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.066
Plate number: Charlie-Tango
832 Romeo.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.668
Call it in, Kono. Every agency.

04:14.304 --> 04:15.604
Listen to me...

04:15.655 --> 04:16.938
Sang Min knows
that we're onto him.

04:17.005 --> 04:19.608
He's going to try to
flee the Island. Yeah.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.111
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't
there a car attached to you?

04:23.162 --> 04:24.613
Oh, weird.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.115
All right, APB is out.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.652
Okay, who is Sang Min?
Fugitive, human trafficker, all-around scumbag.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.254
He's also a known
associate of Victor Hesse,

04:32.321 --> 04:34.289
which puts him in
the same circles as Wo Fat.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.324
Okay, so he could've
been holing up

04:35.391 --> 04:36.324
at Wo Fat's safe house.

04:36.376 --> 04:38.760
Or he was taking
a shot at him.

04:38.828 --> 04:40.929
The front door was rigged with
the explosive charge, right?

04:40.997 --> 04:42.664
I think Sang Min was expecting

04:42.732 --> 04:45.000
Wo Fat to be walking
through that door.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.768
Why-why would he try
to kill him?

04:46.836 --> 04:48.270
I think it was
a preemptive strike.

04:48.337 --> 04:50.672
Sang Min knows that Wo Fat
doesn't like loose ends.

04:50.740 --> 04:53.608
Which is exactly what he became
once he escaped from prison.

04:53.676 --> 04:56.194
Danny!

04:56.279 --> 04:58.146
Danny! Danny!

05:00.083 --> 05:01.316
Danny, you hit?

05:01.367 --> 05:03.351
No. But something's not right.
I can't breathe.

05:04.787 --> 05:06.154
Guys, his pulse is slow.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.823
Okay, I'm going to call
an ambulance.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.325
My chest, I don't know.
I can't breathe.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.626
All right, we got help
on the way, okay?

05:11.694 --> 05:12.828
Just tell me what happened?

05:12.879 --> 05:15.380
Uh, there's a body. No pulse.

05:15.465 --> 05:18.066
This is Officer Kalakaua.
I need an ambulance at Stay with him.

05:18.134 --> 05:19.200
1408 Palolo
Avenue.

05:26.542 --> 05:30.395
Stop! Stop right there!
What is it?

05:30.480 --> 05:31.646
I don't know.

05:31.714 --> 05:33.181
But whatever he died from,
it might be biological.

05:33.232 --> 05:35.216
You have to get Danny
to a hospital right now.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.385
Steve!

05:37.437 --> 05:38.737
Hang in there, hang in there.

05:38.821 --> 05:40.655
He's starting
to convulse!

05:40.723 --> 05:43.992
Danny! Danny! Hey, stay
with me, Danny! Stay with me!

05:47.387 --> 05:51.387

06:17.259 --> 06:20.445
BP's 72 over 40.
Breathing slow and shallow.

06:20.530 --> 06:23.031
How long since his last exposure?
Uh, 20, 30 minutes.

06:23.098 --> 06:24.432
Do we know what kind of
toxin we're dealing with?

06:24.484 --> 06:26.268
I don't know.
My team's still working on it.

06:26.335 --> 06:28.269
You better hurry, because I
don't know how much time he has.

07:03.906 --> 07:05.607
I need to get McGarrett
on the phone.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.476
All right, so... what are
we looking at here?

07:07.543 --> 07:09.678
Victim inside died from
exposure to a chemical weapon;

07:09.745 --> 07:11.012
a nerve agent, to be exact.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.414
How can you be sure?
I spent two years

07:12.481 --> 07:14.833
with the CIA's Biological
Threat Assessment Team.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.018
One of our case studies
was the subway attack

07:17.086 --> 07:19.254
in '95... Right, right, right.
Terrorists released sarin

07:19.322 --> 07:20.755
on multiple trains. Whole
subway system was affected.

07:20.823 --> 07:23.124
And our victim inside
has the same symptoms:

07:23.192 --> 07:24.543
Facial ulcerations,

07:24.627 --> 07:26.795
petechial hemorrhaging in the
eyes, constricted pupils--

07:26.863 --> 07:28.496
Everything is localized
around the head,

07:28.548 --> 07:31.466
which makes me believe that he
ingested the toxin orally.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.268
So someone spiked the milk
that our victim drank.

07:33.336 --> 07:35.270
Sarin is also transdermal,

07:35.338 --> 07:37.038
which means that
Danny was exposed

07:37.106 --> 07:39.841
when he touched the victim
to check for a pulse.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.844
McGarrett.

07:42.912 --> 07:44.145
Hey, it's Kaye. Listen to me.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.981
Danny has been exposed to sarin.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.682
You need to tell the doctors
to get him

07:47.750 --> 07:48.817
on Pralidoxime right away.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.686
If they don't...
he's going to die.

07:59.349 --> 08:01.349
Thanks, Doc.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.793
Hey, how's Danny?

08:03.877 --> 08:05.661
He's, uh, he's okay.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.814
He's responding to the drugs.
I mean, it's still early,

08:07.881 --> 08:10.616
but, uh, they all seem to think
he's going to pull through, so...

08:10.667 --> 08:12.718
All right. Thank God.
Yeah.

08:12.786 --> 08:15.588
You were right about the sarin.

08:15.639 --> 08:17.156
If they didn't
found out when they did,

08:17.224 --> 08:18.958
Danny would probably
be dead right now.

08:19.009 --> 08:21.627
Does he have a family?

08:21.695 --> 08:23.629
Yeah, he's got an ex-wife
and a little girl.

08:23.697 --> 08:26.098
Danny said something about
having Grace this weekend.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.901
Ah, Rachel and Stan
are in Maui.

08:28.969 --> 08:30.570
Hey, can we see him?

08:30.637 --> 08:32.321
Not right now. The doctor
said once he's stable

08:32.405 --> 08:33.639
they're going to move him
to a recovery ward

08:33.690 --> 08:34.974
where he can have
some visitors.

08:35.042 --> 08:38.828
Look, guys, I know this is hard,
and we all want to be here.

08:38.912 --> 08:40.346
But, right now,
we need to I.D. this vic,

08:40.414 --> 08:41.981
and we need to find out
where he bought that milk.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.916
Right. Do you think this
could be an act of terrorism?

08:43.984 --> 08:46.919
Or a random act of mayhem, like
the Tylenol scare in the '80s.

08:46.987 --> 08:49.655
Either way, we need to make sure
there's no further risk, okay.

08:49.706 --> 08:52.124
So, you two, I need you to
contact the milk distributor,

08:52.192 --> 08:53.593
find out where
they sell their product,

08:53.660 --> 08:55.161
and pull everything
off the shelves.

08:55.229 --> 08:56.712
I don't care if we're even
taking resources away

08:56.797 --> 08:58.231
from finding Sang Min.
Right now,

08:58.298 --> 08:59.331
this is our
number one priority.

08:59.383 --> 09:00.349
We're on it.

09:00.434 --> 09:04.170
Kaye, can you coordinate
with CDC?

09:04.238 --> 09:05.337
Gotta make sure
nothing else is contaminated.

09:05.389 --> 09:07.506
Yeah, of course.
I can also send a sample

09:07.558 --> 09:08.858
to a contact at Langley.

09:08.942 --> 09:10.276
He can run chemical analysis,

09:10.344 --> 09:11.861
maybe determine
the source of the sarin.

09:11.945 --> 09:15.364
Hey... Thanks, Jenna.

09:15.449 --> 09:17.316
Oh, please.
You're in crisis mode,

09:17.367 --> 09:18.851
you're down a man, I'm more
than happy to pitch in.

09:18.902 --> 09:21.187
Besides, I don't even
really know if there's a job

09:21.255 --> 09:22.738
waiting for me back home.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.156
Took three months
leave of absence

09:24.224 --> 09:25.958
to hunt down the man who killed
my fiancé, and the last time

09:26.026 --> 09:27.460
I checked the CIA wasn't...

09:27.527 --> 09:29.462
super-keen on the whole, you
know, personal vendetta thing.

09:29.529 --> 09:30.677
So if you think that I can help
you with your investigation...

09:30.702 --> 09:31.731
Kaye. Kaye. Kaye! Kaye!

09:31.732 --> 09:32.899
Yeah.

09:32.966 --> 09:34.000
Well, what I meant to say was

09:34.067 --> 09:36.252
"Thank you for
helping Danny." Okay?

09:36.336 --> 09:39.005
You saved his life.

09:40.807 --> 09:42.441
You're welcome.

09:43.510 --> 09:44.977
Call me if you get something.
Okay.

09:45.045 --> 09:47.046
Where are you going?
Uh...

09:47.097 --> 09:49.649
I got a little something
to take care of.

09:55.689 --> 09:59.506
McGarrett.

10:00.135 --> 10:01.791
SANG MIN
You should have seen your face.

10:01.828 --> 10:04.247
Bet I was the last person

10:04.331 --> 10:05.397
you expected to see, huh?

10:05.449 --> 10:08.901
Have to say I was
pretty surprised myself.

10:08.952 --> 10:12.622
I'm guessing that bomb on the
door was intended for Wo Fat.

10:12.706 --> 10:14.240
Doesn't matter now, does it?

10:14.308 --> 10:16.075
We both missed our shot.

10:16.143 --> 10:18.761
But I might be able
to give you a second chance.

10:18.845 --> 10:19.946
What's it worth

10:20.013 --> 10:22.848
if I help you find him?
What's it worth?

10:22.916 --> 10:25.751
Not much, okay? Considering
you've already burned us once.

10:25.819 --> 10:27.753
Well, the situation has changed.

10:27.821 --> 10:29.221
All right, you want
to make a deal? Great.

10:29.273 --> 10:31.256
Here's what I'm prepared
to offer you.

10:34.294 --> 10:35.227
Hey, Gracie!

10:35.279 --> 10:37.730
Uncle Steve!
Hey.

10:37.781 --> 10:40.032
Hi, kiddo.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.167
Where's Daddy?

10:42.202 --> 10:43.869
Listen, Gracie,

10:43.937 --> 10:47.790
Danno's, uh, Danno's not feeling
the best, okay? So I'm going to

10:47.874 --> 10:49.442
take you to the hospital.
We're going to go see him.

10:49.509 --> 10:51.377
Is he going to be okay?

10:51.444 --> 10:54.080
Is he going to be okay?
Let me tell you something about your father.

10:54.147 --> 10:56.115
He might not talk like it,

10:56.183 --> 10:58.150
but he is one tough guy,
and he's brave, as well.

10:59.452 --> 11:01.253
Can you be brave like Danno?

11:01.305 --> 11:03.288
Are you sure?
Then we should go see him.

11:03.340 --> 11:04.690
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

11:06.727 --> 11:09.595
<i>Pae'aina Dairy
products sell at over</i>

11:09.663 --> 11:10.963
a hundred locations
on the Island.

11:11.031 --> 11:12.098
We pulled all

11:12.165 --> 11:14.633
of their milk cartons
off the shelves.

11:14.685 --> 11:15.935
CDC is doing
some random testing,

11:16.003 --> 11:18.304
but so far none of the samples
have turned up positive

11:18.372 --> 11:20.673
for sarin, except for the one
that our victim drank from.

11:20.741 --> 11:22.708
So it's looking like
an isolated incident.

11:22.776 --> 11:24.577
Now the question is,
was it random

11:24.644 --> 11:26.012
or was our victim targeted?

11:26.079 --> 11:29.348
Sarin seems like an odd
choice for a murder weapon.

11:29.416 --> 11:30.950
It's actually not
as far-fetched

11:31.018 --> 11:32.284
as you might think.

11:32.336 --> 11:34.220
Used to be that
sarin was hard to get,

11:34.287 --> 11:37.340
but ever since 9/11 we've
taken down so many terror cells

11:37.424 --> 11:39.558
that sarin brokers are
looking for new customers.

11:39.626 --> 11:42.395
Basically, anyone with cash and
connections to the black market

11:42.462 --> 11:43.696
can get their hands on it.

11:43.764 --> 11:45.798
Hey, got an I.D. on our vic.

11:45.866 --> 11:47.500
Guy's name is
Amoka Mulitalo,

11:47.567 --> 11:49.852
57 years old.
Was arrested six months ago

11:49.936 --> 11:51.137
for misdemeanor
trespassing.

11:51.204 --> 11:52.571
Which is interesting,
considering the house

11:52.639 --> 11:54.206
we found him in
wasn't his own.

11:54.274 --> 11:56.342
Well, whose house is it?

11:56.410 --> 11:58.310
Jeff and Sheila Fallon.

11:58.362 --> 12:01.513
Pay taxes in California,
but keep this home

12:01.565 --> 12:02.715
as a vacation rental.

12:02.783 --> 12:03.883
So, what's Amoka

12:03.950 --> 12:06.352
doing in their house
drinking tainted milk?

12:07.521 --> 12:09.822
<i>My father was never the same</i>

12:09.890 --> 12:11.791
after his auto accident.

12:11.875 --> 12:15.561
He suffered from aphasia,
impaired memory.

12:15.629 --> 12:17.229
He just couldn't
manage for himself.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.698
So... we had him
move in with us.

12:19.766 --> 12:21.200
You filed a missing
persons report

12:21.268 --> 12:22.935
for your father
a few weeks ago.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.204
That wasn't the first
time, either, was it?

12:25.272 --> 12:27.006
Sometimes...

12:27.074 --> 12:29.008
he'll go for a walk,

12:29.059 --> 12:30.910
forget how to get home.

12:30.977 --> 12:32.678
If I couldn't find him,

12:32.746 --> 12:34.513
I'll file a missing
persons report.

12:34.581 --> 12:36.015
Then, a few days later,

12:36.066 --> 12:39.885
the police will find him
on the street or...

12:39.953 --> 12:41.720
at a shelter.

12:41.772 --> 12:43.789
But this time...

12:48.161 --> 12:49.762
<i>I'm sorry, but...</i>

12:49.830 --> 12:51.897
we've never seen him before.

12:51.965 --> 12:54.049
I don't understand.
How did this man

12:54.117 --> 12:56.235
end up dead in our house?

12:56.303 --> 12:57.837
We believe he was
squatting there,

12:57.904 --> 12:59.705
and when he was
in your home,

12:59.773 --> 13:01.474
he drank some milk
from the refrigerator.

13:01.541 --> 13:03.676
That milk was laced with sarin--
it's a compound

13:03.743 --> 13:05.211
that's used
as a chemical weapon.

13:05.278 --> 13:07.580
It killed him
within minutes.

13:07.647 --> 13:08.948
What is it?

13:09.015 --> 13:11.050
We were supposed
to come to Hawaii

13:11.118 --> 13:12.718
last week.

13:13.887 --> 13:16.255
I asked our caretaker, Gabriel,

13:16.323 --> 13:17.923
to stock the refrigerator.

13:17.991 --> 13:20.059
But we ended up
canceling the trip.

13:20.127 --> 13:22.128
So Gabriel's the one
who bought the milk?

13:22.195 --> 13:23.395
Yes.

13:23.447 --> 13:25.731
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

13:25.799 --> 13:28.167
A few days ago,
when we let him go.

13:28.235 --> 13:29.768
You fired him? Why?

13:29.836 --> 13:32.905
We had given him a checkbook
to cover expenses.

13:32.973 --> 13:34.673
Bills, repairs and such.

13:34.741 --> 13:38.344
Last week, we found he had been
writing checks to himself.

13:38.411 --> 13:40.546
I called him.
He denied it at first,

13:40.614 --> 13:43.382
but... eventually,
he came clean.

13:43.450 --> 13:46.185
I told him to keep the money
and leave us his key.

13:46.253 --> 13:47.586
How did he take that?

13:47.637 --> 13:49.522
Not well.

13:49.589 --> 13:51.957
He was very upset.

13:52.008 --> 13:54.193
You think the caretaker
planted the sarin?

13:54.261 --> 13:56.028
Well, the man has
a history of violence.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.629
He served time
for aggravated assault

13:57.681 --> 13:59.014
in several
home-invasion robberies,

13:59.099 --> 14:01.817
plus he was just fired,
which does give him motive.

14:01.902 --> 14:02.985
But it doesn't give him means,

14:03.069 --> 14:04.370
and sarin's not exactly
easy to find.

14:04.437 --> 14:06.655
I mean, how does a local
caretaker get his hands on it?

14:06.740 --> 14:08.007
Right. I'm still
running background.

14:08.074 --> 14:09.608
But Chin and Kono
are on their way

14:09.676 --> 14:10.843
to ask him that very question.

14:10.911 --> 14:13.412
Okay, I got to go, okay?
Just keep me posted.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.580
Yeah, sure thing.

14:14.647 --> 14:17.316
Hey, Doc, how's he going?

14:17.367 --> 14:18.650
Ready for some visitors.

14:18.702 --> 14:19.752
All right.

14:19.819 --> 14:21.053
Let's go, Gracie.

14:26.092 --> 14:28.360
STEVE
Looks like he's sleeping.

14:31.798 --> 14:33.015
Danno!

14:33.099 --> 14:34.499
Monkey!

14:34.551 --> 14:37.203
Mm! Mm!

14:37.270 --> 14:39.271
I made this for you.

14:39.339 --> 14:40.806
You did?

14:40.857 --> 14:42.775
Look at this.

14:42.842 --> 14:45.110
This is me.
See, this is a masterpiece.

14:45.178 --> 14:47.379
Look at that.
I mean, she's an artist, no?

14:47.447 --> 14:48.881
It's beautiful.

14:48.949 --> 14:51.116
So I'm gonna make a nice
space on the refrigerator

14:51.184 --> 14:52.451
and move some
stuff around.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.353
This is going
dead center.

14:54.421 --> 14:56.322
Thank you.

14:57.424 --> 14:59.792
How you feeling?
Uh...

14:59.859 --> 15:01.794
I don't know,
I feel like everything hurts.

15:01.861 --> 15:03.495
Head feels like
it's gonna explode.

15:03.563 --> 15:05.464
It's, like, the worst
hangover I ever had.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.166
What's a hangover?

15:07.234 --> 15:09.935
It's, uh, you'll figure it out,
you'll learn about it

15:10.003 --> 15:11.870
one day when you're
about, what, 35?

15:11.922 --> 15:13.806
35, thirty... 60.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.074
40 years old.

15:16.576 --> 15:17.643
Thank you.

15:17.711 --> 15:19.712
Don't mention it.

15:21.714 --> 15:24.099
Listen, since you're, uh,
since you're looking so...

15:24.184 --> 15:25.384
so good now,

15:25.452 --> 15:27.419
I'm gonna head back
to the office, okay?

15:27.487 --> 15:29.421
I'll swing by
and pick her up later.

15:29.489 --> 15:31.724
She can stay with me until,
uh, until Rachel gets back.

15:31.791 --> 15:33.726
How does that sound?
What do you think?

15:34.761 --> 15:36.362
Okay.

15:36.429 --> 15:38.564
You okay?

15:38.632 --> 15:40.749
I got everything
I need right here.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.034
I'm good.

15:42.669 --> 15:44.003
Huh? Huh?

15:44.070 --> 15:46.005
Hey.

15:46.072 --> 15:48.841
You kidnap Miley Cyrus
and put her in your backpack,

15:48.908 --> 15:50.376
or is that a cell phone?

15:50.427 --> 15:52.678
Stan bought it for me.
He did?

15:52.745 --> 15:54.380
Fabulous. Go answer it.

15:54.431 --> 15:58.250
First boy that calls,
I'm gonna whip that thing

15:58.318 --> 15:59.718
into the Pacific Ocean, okay?

15:59.769 --> 16:01.920
Hi, Mommy.

16:01.988 --> 16:03.922
Yeah, I'm with Daddy.

16:03.974 --> 16:05.090
He's in the hospital.

16:06.426 --> 16:08.110
Mommy wants to talk to you.

16:09.145 --> 16:10.696
Hi, Rachel.

16:10.764 --> 16:12.798
No, I'm fine.

16:12.866 --> 16:14.333
Would
you please stop?

16:14.401 --> 16:15.467
I said I'm fine.

16:15.535 --> 16:16.969
I like hospital food;
you know that.

16:17.037 --> 16:19.271
I checked in for the weekend;
I like it here, it's nice.

16:27.614 --> 16:29.148
Oh, yeah.

16:29.215 --> 16:31.150
This place, they make
a kick-ass loco moco.

16:31.217 --> 16:33.452
Yeah? Too bad we
won't be staying for lunch.

16:40.827 --> 16:42.828
Gabriel Delgado?

16:47.567 --> 16:50.686
I'm going out the front!

16:58.244 --> 17:00.479
Five-O! Stay down
and don't move.

17:07.212 --> 17:09.180
<i>Look, I told you,</i>

17:09.231 --> 17:12.148
my son... he's sick.

17:12.217 --> 17:14.852
He's got leukemia.

17:16.722 --> 17:19.522
First five years of his life,
I'm locked up.

17:19.590 --> 17:20.825
I finally get out of prison,

17:20.892 --> 17:22.393
I can't even pay
his hospital bill.

17:22.461 --> 17:24.729
What kind of father
does that make me?

17:24.796 --> 17:27.131
So is that why you
stole from the Fallons?

17:29.167 --> 17:31.135
I got another job
driving the airport shuttle.

17:31.203 --> 17:34.371
I was gonna put the money
back in their account as soon as

17:34.439 --> 17:36.407
I got paid. But they found
out before you could, right?

17:36.475 --> 17:38.375
And you knew if they
reported the crime,

17:38.427 --> 17:40.044
it was back to prison for you.

17:40.112 --> 17:41.712
That's why you
tried to kill them.

17:43.815 --> 17:45.282
What?

17:45.350 --> 17:48.519
Did you buy groceries
for the Fallons last week?

17:48.587 --> 17:49.887
I did.

17:49.955 --> 17:51.388
Well,
we found sarin

17:51.456 --> 17:54.725
inside a milk carton that
you put in their fridge.

17:54.776 --> 17:56.861
Why don't you
tell us about that?

17:56.928 --> 17:59.396
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:59.498 --> 18:02.199
I don't even know
what... sarin is.

18:02.267 --> 18:06.036
Oh, really?
Let me show you.

18:06.104 --> 18:08.539
This is sarin.

18:08.606 --> 18:10.775
And that's what
sarin does to you.

18:10.842 --> 18:12.943
Oh, my God.

18:12.994 --> 18:14.462
Amoka.

18:15.914 --> 18:18.082
What, you know him?

18:18.133 --> 18:19.449
Yeah.

18:19.501 --> 18:22.753
Yeah, I-I take my boy
to Blessed People's Mission.

18:22.821 --> 18:25.222
They have a free clinic
once a week.

18:25.290 --> 18:27.925
Amoka sometimes
sleeps at their shelter.

18:27.993 --> 18:29.627
Kind man.

18:29.694 --> 18:31.061
Even with all
his own problems,

18:31.129 --> 18:34.331
he would always
ask about my son.

18:34.399 --> 18:37.101
I knew he was having
a hard time there,

18:37.169 --> 18:39.036
so I told him about the rock.

18:39.104 --> 18:40.971
What rock?

18:49.480 --> 18:52.700
<i>So, the Fallons hid a spare key</i>

18:52.767 --> 18:53.784
at their property.

18:53.852 --> 18:55.119
We found it in
the backyard,

18:55.170 --> 18:56.921
and Gabriel admitted
to telling Amoka about it.

18:56.988 --> 18:58.873
Said that he stayed there
for a few nights

18:58.957 --> 19:00.024
when the shelter
got overcrowded.

19:00.091 --> 19:01.542
And we believe him?
I spoke to the mission;

19:01.626 --> 19:03.127
story checks out.

19:03.178 --> 19:04.828
Apparently, Amoka
stayed at the shelter

19:04.880 --> 19:06.263
off and on for
two months.

19:06.331 --> 19:09.166
Same dates as Gabriel's son
was getting treatment.

19:09.234 --> 19:10.701
If Gabriel planted sarin
in the milk,

19:10.769 --> 19:12.336
the last thing
he's gonna want to do

19:12.404 --> 19:14.805
is let a hungry homeless guy
come and stay at the house

19:14.873 --> 19:16.473
before the targets return.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.192
So we just lost our only suspect.
The good news

19:18.276 --> 19:19.810
is we may have
picked up a new one.

19:19.861 --> 19:22.780
I pulled a fresh print
off the spare key.

19:22.847 --> 19:25.515
It belongs to Elliot Connor--
his fingerprints are on file

19:25.567 --> 19:27.551
with the SEC.
How does he know Jeff

19:27.619 --> 19:29.019
and Sheila Fallon?
Well, in addition

19:29.070 --> 19:30.855
to being Jeff's brother-in-law,
he's also an employee.

19:30.922 --> 19:33.290
He's the COO
of Jeff's company.

19:33.358 --> 19:34.658
They do big business
manufacturing

19:34.726 --> 19:36.126
industrial storage equipment.

19:36.194 --> 19:37.394
Check this out.

19:37.462 --> 19:39.663
According to
<i>International Business News,</i>

19:39.731 --> 19:41.365
there have been rumors
about friction between

19:41.433 --> 19:42.967
Jeff and Elliot.

19:43.034 --> 19:45.636
Apparently some of the board
meetings have gotten contentious.

19:45.704 --> 19:46.703
Sounds like motive.

19:46.755 --> 19:47.922
You guys go talk to Jeff,

19:48.006 --> 19:49.506
see what he's got
to say about it,

19:49.558 --> 19:51.225
and I'll go see Elliot.

19:54.412 --> 19:57.248
<i>Look, I already</i>
<i>gave you my statement.</i>

19:57.315 --> 19:59.683
Well, if you want
to bring me in again,

19:59.734 --> 20:01.919
you know where to find me.

20:10.662 --> 20:14.365
I may as well tell you,
'cause you're gonna find out.

20:17.903 --> 20:20.204
I returned the money to I.A.

20:20.272 --> 20:23.307
It was the only way to keep
Uncle Keako out of prison.

20:24.509 --> 20:27.511
Where did you even come up
with $200,000?

20:27.579 --> 20:29.513
Got a loan from somebody.

20:29.581 --> 20:31.515
Borrowed against the house.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.318
This is crazy.

20:34.386 --> 20:37.087
All I.A. has to do
is run the serial numbers,

20:37.155 --> 20:39.857
and they'll know they won't match
the ones that were stolen.

20:39.924 --> 20:41.191
Actually, they
can't do that.

20:41.259 --> 20:43.260
Inventory logs for the
Asset Forfeiture Locker

20:43.328 --> 20:45.262
when missing years ago.

20:45.330 --> 20:46.730
How do you know that?

20:46.781 --> 20:48.265
Everybody in the
department knows it.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.267
It's the worst-kept
secret on the island.

20:50.335 --> 20:52.036
I never heard about it.
That's 'cause

20:52.103 --> 20:53.904
you never walked a beat.

20:53.972 --> 20:55.873
Somewhere, right now,
there are two cops

20:55.940 --> 20:59.610
telling this story over
coffee and malasadas.

21:02.314 --> 21:04.415
Cuz...

21:04.482 --> 21:07.551
you've been carrying this
for a long time.

21:07.619 --> 21:10.321
You took the blame for
a crime you didn't commit,

21:10.388 --> 21:11.622
and you lost your job...

21:11.690 --> 21:13.958
your friends...

21:14.025 --> 21:16.527
and your family.

21:16.594 --> 21:20.431
And now you have a chance
to get out from under all this.

21:20.498 --> 21:22.466
And what?

21:22.534 --> 21:24.435
You're gonna throw
it all away,

21:24.502 --> 21:25.970
put yourself into debt,

21:26.037 --> 21:28.372
and go to prison?

21:42.787 --> 21:43.988
Excuse me.

21:44.055 --> 21:45.723
We'd like to see
Elliot Connor.

21:47.158 --> 21:49.259
Sorry, he's in a meeting now.

21:49.327 --> 21:50.894
See if you can
free him up for us.

21:50.962 --> 21:51.929
<i>Rumors of a rift</i>

21:51.996 --> 21:53.597
between me and Jeff
are nonsense.

21:53.664 --> 21:54.831
Have there been disagreements?

21:54.883 --> 21:56.266
Of course, but that's normal

21:56.334 --> 21:58.018
when you're managing
a business with someone.

21:58.103 --> 21:59.520
Well, just out of curiosity,

21:59.604 --> 22:01.672
Mr. Connor, what were
your disagreements about?

22:01.740 --> 22:03.507
Jeff relocated me
to Hawaii

22:03.575 --> 22:05.109
to run the Pacific
base of operations.

22:05.176 --> 22:07.978
The company's planning
a big push into Asia.

22:08.029 --> 22:10.147
We had some differences of
opinion on marketing strategy.

22:10.198 --> 22:11.382
That's it.

22:11.449 --> 22:14.034
One of the advantages of
working with my brother-in-law

22:14.119 --> 22:16.286
is that we can slug it out
at the office,

22:16.354 --> 22:18.789
but at the end of the day,
it's family first.

22:18.856 --> 22:20.424
Work always comes second.

22:20.492 --> 22:22.192
Sounds like you're close.

22:22.243 --> 22:23.327
That's nice.

22:25.764 --> 22:26.764
So, uh, tell
me something.

22:26.831 --> 22:28.165
Jeff and Sheila--
do they ever have

22:28.233 --> 22:30.701
you come by the house,
check on the property?

22:30.769 --> 22:34.004
No, they have a caretaker who
stays there when they're away.

22:34.072 --> 22:35.939
All right, then, why did we find
your fingerprint

22:36.007 --> 22:37.674
on the spare key that was hidden
outside the house?

22:40.979 --> 22:43.180
You know, I did use
that key once

22:43.248 --> 22:44.681
to drop off
some papers--

22:44.733 --> 22:46.049
the Q4 financial report.

22:46.101 --> 22:47.918
I wanted Jeff to review it
as soon as he arrived.

22:47.986 --> 22:50.654
Please don't lie to us.
I'm not.

22:50.722 --> 22:52.656
You shifted in your chair
and you touched your face

22:52.724 --> 22:54.224
as you were answering
the question.

22:54.292 --> 22:55.859
Those are both signs
of deception.

22:55.910 --> 22:57.694
Plus, you added
unnecessary details

22:57.762 --> 22:58.862
about delivering the papers

22:58.930 --> 23:00.697
just to make your lie sound
more credible.

23:01.966 --> 23:03.434
Does Jeff know

23:03.501 --> 23:05.936
that you're using his house
to cheat on his sister?

23:06.004 --> 23:07.504
What?

23:07.572 --> 23:08.505
That's absurd.

23:08.573 --> 23:09.506
Wow,

23:09.574 --> 23:11.341
mock outrage-- that's a bad one.

23:11.409 --> 23:12.743
Tan line on your finger there.

23:12.811 --> 23:15.179
Forget to put your
wedding band back on

23:15.246 --> 23:16.447
after your
last hookup?

23:20.485 --> 23:22.052
Look,

23:22.103 --> 23:23.420
here's what I think's
going on, okay?

23:23.488 --> 23:24.855
Either

23:24.923 --> 23:26.557
you've been using Jeff's
house to carry on an affair

23:26.624 --> 23:28.091
and that's why we found
your print on the key,

23:28.143 --> 23:30.811
or you were in the house
trying to kill your partner.

23:32.664 --> 23:34.298
Which is it?

23:40.104 --> 23:42.506
We haven't used the house
in months...

23:44.342 --> 23:46.710
...not since Jeff confronted me
about it,

23:46.777 --> 23:48.078
and that's
the real reason things

23:48.146 --> 23:49.780
have been tense here at work.
It has nothing to do

23:49.848 --> 23:52.149
with business.
Well, with all due respect,

23:52.217 --> 23:54.218
Elliott, you were using his
house to cheat on his sister.

23:54.285 --> 23:56.220
I can hardly blame him
for being upset.

23:56.287 --> 23:58.355
I know it's terrible.

23:58.423 --> 24:01.158
Jeff asked me to break it off
with Chloe, and I'm going to.

24:01.226 --> 24:03.327
Just haven't gotten
around to it yet?

24:03.394 --> 24:04.561
We're going
to need to talk

24:04.629 --> 24:05.796
to Chloe, okay,

24:05.864 --> 24:07.131
to corroborate this.
Go ahead.

24:07.198 --> 24:09.199
She's right outside.

24:12.654 --> 24:13.871
The secretary?

24:13.938 --> 24:15.022
That's original.

24:16.991 --> 24:18.242
Can I ask you
a question?

24:18.309 --> 24:19.943
So, what do you need
a slingshot for?

24:20.011 --> 24:20.994
Doesn't make
any sense to me.

24:21.079 --> 24:21.995
I mean, they're birds.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.313
Can't they fly?

24:23.381 --> 24:25.282
These birds
don't have wings.

24:25.350 --> 24:27.201
Oh, that explains it.

24:27.285 --> 24:28.519
Now I know
why they're so angry.

24:28.586 --> 24:30.487
Thank you
for clarifying.

24:30.538 --> 24:32.456
Howzit, Jersey?

24:32.524 --> 24:35.292
Hey, big dog,
what's going on?

24:35.360 --> 24:36.293
Grace,

24:36.361 --> 24:37.294
you remember
Kamekona.

24:37.362 --> 24:38.295
Hi.

24:38.363 --> 24:40.214
What up, shorty?

24:40.298 --> 24:41.798
Figured you guys need some grub.

24:41.850 --> 24:44.301
I know hospital foods are
the worst and the portions--

24:44.369 --> 24:45.802
very small.

24:45.854 --> 24:46.803
That's very sweet

24:46.871 --> 24:47.804
of you.

24:47.872 --> 24:49.206
Fried chicken?

24:49.274 --> 24:50.224
Filipino-style.

24:50.308 --> 24:52.276
Best on the island, brah.

24:52.343 --> 24:53.310
You know, Gracie,

24:53.378 --> 24:54.844
when I was
a little <i>keiki</i> like you,

24:54.896 --> 24:58.882
my mama used to bring me this
chicken every time I was sick.

24:58.950 --> 25:01.351
Fried chicken isn't
good for you.

25:01.419 --> 25:03.520
It has cholesterol and
causes heart disease.

25:03.588 --> 25:04.655
Nah,

25:04.706 --> 25:06.757
a little bit of grease
is good for you.

25:06.824 --> 25:09.726
Helps the insides stay
lubricated.

25:09.794 --> 25:12.195
Drumstick
or thigh?

25:12.247 --> 25:14.965
Um, I'm gonna go--
I like white meat.

25:15.049 --> 25:16.166
Is there a breast?

25:16.217 --> 25:18.669
Sorry, all gone.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.504
That was a long drive, brah.

25:20.572 --> 25:21.738
I know, I know.

25:21.806 --> 25:24.007
Well, I didn't call you here
for the chicken.

25:24.058 --> 25:26.727
Gracie, put your headphones on,
please.

25:26.811 --> 25:30.046
So... your boy Sang Min
has resurfaced.

25:30.098 --> 25:31.932
Heard he bounced
a few months ago.

25:32.016 --> 25:33.584
He's back?
In a big way.

25:33.651 --> 25:35.185
Looks like he took a swing
at some heavy hitters

25:35.253 --> 25:36.520
and he missed.

25:36.571 --> 25:38.238
My guess is he's looking
for a way off the Island,

25:38.323 --> 25:40.390
so I need you

25:40.491 --> 25:42.593
to get on the coconut wireless,
make a couple calls.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.894
You found him for us once,
you can do it again, right?

25:46.531 --> 25:48.532
Sure, let me use your phone.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.766
What's wrong with your phone?

25:49.834 --> 25:50.767
I don't bring 'em

25:50.835 --> 25:52.369
to the hospitals no more, brah.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.072
You heard about the signals
interfering with the pacemakers?

25:56.424 --> 25:58.342
It's true.

25:58.409 --> 25:59.376
Okay, you can use my phone.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.378
Will you wipe
your greasy paws off

26:01.446 --> 26:03.247
before you touch
my phone, though?

26:03.314 --> 26:04.848
What grease?

26:04.915 --> 26:06.450
Yeah, they look like...

26:06.517 --> 26:09.720
That's sufficient.

26:11.322 --> 26:12.856
<i>Hey.</i>

26:12.924 --> 26:14.558
You got something?

26:14.609 --> 26:15.692
Yeah, I got a call

26:15.760 --> 26:17.494
from your CIA contact.

26:17.562 --> 26:19.129
They found a chemical match
to our sarin.

26:19.197 --> 26:20.864
Turns out it's
the same strand

26:20.932 --> 26:22.399
used by a Chechen terror group

26:22.450 --> 26:24.601
in a botched Moscow attack
five years ago,

26:24.652 --> 26:25.786
and the Russian FSB

26:25.870 --> 26:29.439
identified the supplier
as Mikhail Yursky,

26:29.507 --> 26:30.607
and get this--

26:30.675 --> 26:31.875
Mr. Yursky arrived

26:31.943 --> 26:34.811
in Hawaii five days ago
under a fake passport.

26:34.879 --> 26:36.446
Time line matches the murder.

26:36.497 --> 26:37.848
Then that's our killer.

26:37.915 --> 26:39.583
Now all we have to do
is find him.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.306
Police!
Police! Go, go, go!

26:51.994 --> 26:53.845
Clear.
You're all secure.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.148
Hey, Mikhail's not here.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.378
What do you got?

26:58.379 --> 26:59.310
We found a credit card
under the same name

26:59.335 --> 27:01.118
as his fake passport.

27:01.178 --> 27:02.779
He just purchased a flight
to Borneo.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.950
Leaves tonight at 7:00.

27:04.034 --> 27:05.435
All right, notify the TSA.

27:05.502 --> 27:07.136
We'll have the sheriff's
department cover the flight

27:07.204 --> 27:09.405
and we'll leave a unit here at
the hotel in case he comes back.

27:09.456 --> 27:11.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey,
I just got a fresh hit.

27:11.274 --> 27:12.809
His card's being used
at an ATM

27:12.876 --> 27:15.378
right now--
Central Pacific Bank on Alakawa.

27:15.446 --> 27:17.330
That's a couple blocks away.
We're on the way.

27:17.414 --> 27:18.948
Okay, I'll see
if I can stall him for you.

27:37.735 --> 27:40.937
Now you might want to try
checking the magnetic strip.

27:41.005 --> 27:43.472
Maybe clean it.

27:43.524 --> 27:46.175
Oh, you're good.

27:46.243 --> 27:48.328
Perfect.

27:52.483 --> 27:53.983
Not good, not good.

27:54.034 --> 27:55.752
Steve, he's on the move.
Got him-- right there.

27:55.819 --> 27:57.003
Got him.

28:24.565 --> 28:26.515
<i>All units, be advised.</i>

28:26.567 --> 28:28.117
Suspect is
in a maroon sedan

28:28.185 --> 28:29.652
traveling north
on Alakawa.

29:09.559 --> 29:11.911
Hey!

29:29.980 --> 29:31.814
Stand back, the
canister has a leak.

29:31.882 --> 29:33.249
He's been exposed.
I'll call for an ambulance,

29:33.317 --> 29:34.784
get HPD Hazmat
as well.

29:34.852 --> 29:35.852
Go, go.

29:42.609 --> 29:44.560
Yeah, we're at an alleyway
behind the 1500 block

29:44.611 --> 29:47.830
of Alakawa.

29:47.898 --> 29:50.483
Chin,
he's done, he's dead.

29:50.567 --> 29:51.868
Uh, chuck the ambulance.

29:51.935 --> 29:53.602
Send the M.E. and
the Hazmat team.

29:53.654 --> 29:55.872
Okay, all right.

29:55.939 --> 29:57.106
Hey.

30:00.627 --> 30:02.612
What the hell?

30:11.472 --> 30:14.090
Are we ready for that extra credit?
Extra credit?

30:14.141 --> 30:15.525
You're telling me
that this guy

30:15.592 --> 30:16.893
is not from
around here?

30:16.960 --> 30:20.062
No, Dad, SpongeBob lives in
a pineapple under the sea.

30:20.130 --> 30:22.064
Well, what else could be
more Hawaiian than that?

30:22.132 --> 30:23.599
Huh?
Mommy.

30:24.634 --> 30:27.570
Daddy's not sick
anymore.

30:27.637 --> 30:29.689
I am so happy to see that.

30:29.773 --> 30:31.807
Hey.

30:33.610 --> 30:36.112
You didn't have to come.

30:36.163 --> 30:39.115
Yes, I did.

30:47.174 --> 30:49.125
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>once it's deemed safe,</i>

30:49.193 --> 30:52.228
have HPD process the
car for evidence.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.131
Hazmat team just
finished checking

30:55.182 --> 30:56.732
the canisters in
Mikhail's trunk--

30:56.800 --> 30:58.334
empty with no
signs of toxins.

30:58.402 --> 31:00.102
Well, he was about to leave
the island with them.

31:00.170 --> 31:01.504
I'm guessing he was going
to use the canisters

31:01.572 --> 31:02.738
to traffic the sarin.

31:02.806 --> 31:04.173
Yeah, what's still
not adding up, though,

31:04.224 --> 31:06.209
is why a bioweapons dealer
with terrorist ties

31:06.276 --> 31:08.678
would target two innocent
people from the mainland.

31:08.745 --> 31:09.779
What's going on?

31:14.351 --> 31:16.285
Commander McGarrett.

31:16.353 --> 31:17.386
David Akahoshi,
Internal Affairs.

31:17.454 --> 31:18.520
I know who you are.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.690
What are you doing here?

31:20.757 --> 31:24.760
I came to return
something to Mr. Kelly.

31:28.165 --> 31:29.365
The serial numbers
on these bills

31:29.416 --> 31:31.133
don't match the
stolen money,

31:31.201 --> 31:33.202
which means you're trying

31:33.270 --> 31:34.203
to cover for
your uncle.

31:34.254 --> 31:35.771
Those inventory logs disappeared

31:35.839 --> 31:37.039
years ago, so those
serial numbers don't exist.

31:37.090 --> 31:39.208
Actually,
they do.

31:39.276 --> 31:42.011
After the forfeiture
locker was robbed,

31:42.079 --> 31:43.913
I.A. kept waiting
for you to slip up

31:43.981 --> 31:45.448
and spend the
money somewhere.

31:45.515 --> 31:48.351
We figured that you
were being careful,

31:48.402 --> 31:51.053
so we had the asset forfeiture
division put the word out

31:51.121 --> 31:53.122
that their inventory records
had been lost.

31:53.190 --> 31:54.557
It was all a lie.

31:54.625 --> 31:57.560
If you thought we couldn't
trace the serial numbers,

31:57.628 --> 32:00.263
maybe you would finally start
spending the money,

32:00.330 --> 32:01.831
but that never happened

32:01.898 --> 32:03.833
because you
never stole it.

32:03.900 --> 32:04.834
Chin,

32:04.901 --> 32:06.669
this has gone too far.

32:06.737 --> 32:09.205
You got your money back.

32:09.256 --> 32:10.239
Let this go.

32:10.307 --> 32:12.642
I'm sorry, but I
can't do that.

32:12.709 --> 32:16.745
I know you were just trying
to protect your family,

32:16.797 --> 32:19.749
which is why I am not
going to charge you

32:19.816 --> 32:22.151
with obstruction
of justice.

32:22.219 --> 32:25.721
I'm not even going to ask
where you got that money,

32:25.789 --> 32:28.391
but your uncle stole from the
Honolulu Police Department,

32:28.442 --> 32:31.894
which means he stole from
the people of Hawaii,

32:31.962 --> 32:34.797
and he's going to have
to answer for that.

32:44.274 --> 32:47.143
I myself am going to ask
where you got this money.

32:49.179 --> 32:51.847
Marcum.

32:51.915 --> 32:53.883
The bookie?

32:53.950 --> 32:57.453
I signed the deed
to my house over to him.

32:59.289 --> 33:02.124
Return it.
Get your deed back.

33:02.175 --> 33:03.526
Steve...

33:03.593 --> 33:05.628
I didn't have a choice.
Listen to me, all right?

33:05.696 --> 33:07.680
If you did this for your uncle,

33:07.764 --> 33:10.399
you don't have to explain
anything else to me.

33:13.687 --> 33:14.937
Uh...

33:15.772 --> 33:17.606
You guys need to see this.

33:19.359 --> 33:21.310
<i>So, any respectable chemist</i>

33:21.361 --> 33:22.912
can synthesize sarin;

33:22.979 --> 33:25.614
the trick is not killing
yourself in the process.

33:25.682 --> 33:27.616
Because in addition to
having a short half-life,

33:27.684 --> 33:28.751
sarin's also
extremely volatile,

33:28.819 --> 33:30.586
making storage a challenge.

33:30.654 --> 33:35.157
The ideal container is electro-polished
aluminum, double-walled

33:35.225 --> 33:36.175
with a fail-safe
coupling valve--

33:36.259 --> 33:37.626
but those can be
difficult to procure.

33:37.694 --> 33:39.261
That's right, because
the FBI monitors

33:39.329 --> 33:41.663
large sales of these things
to make sure that

33:41.715 --> 33:43.833
they're not being used
to traffic chemical weapons.

33:43.900 --> 33:46.936
Exactly. Which is why it's
so impressive that we found

33:47.003 --> 33:48.270
36 of these canisters

33:48.338 --> 33:49.939
in Mikhail's trunk.

33:50.006 --> 33:51.941
Check out who
the manufacturer is.

33:52.008 --> 33:54.026
Fallon Global?
That's Jeff and Elliot's company.

33:54.111 --> 33:56.011
So Mikhail
ends up getting

33:56.079 --> 33:57.380
his canisters from them,

33:57.447 --> 34:00.082
and his sarin ends up
at Jeff's house.

34:00.150 --> 34:02.685
That's not all-- I pulled
Mikhail's phone records.

34:02.753 --> 34:04.954
Guess who he called
the day he landed?

34:05.021 --> 34:07.656
Mr. Connor.

34:09.592 --> 34:11.025
Have you got a minute?

34:12.496 --> 34:15.531
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

34:15.599 --> 34:19.201
That's funny, 'cause he
called here the other day.

34:19.268 --> 34:21.370
Three times.
I didn't speak with him.

34:21.438 --> 34:22.972
Oh, yeah?
Phone records show the calls

34:23.039 --> 34:24.806
came into your direct
line, and you spoke

34:24.875 --> 34:26.007
for a total
of 12 minutes.

34:26.076 --> 34:27.176
We think we might know

34:27.226 --> 34:28.310
what you were
talking about, too.

34:28.378 --> 34:29.594
You see, Mikhail,
he wanted equipment

34:29.679 --> 34:32.047
that your company produces
so he could store his sarin.

34:32.099 --> 34:34.250
You wanted your brother-
in-law out of the picture

34:34.317 --> 34:35.684
so you could
run the company.

34:35.752 --> 34:37.319
What's it called?

34:37.387 --> 34:38.420
Quid pro quo?

34:38.487 --> 34:39.655
No. I was thinking
of something else.

34:39.723 --> 34:42.358
Oh, yeah.
Conspiracy to solicit murder.

34:44.828 --> 34:46.896
These calls,
when did they happen?

34:46.963 --> 34:48.597
Thursday, the 13th.

34:48.665 --> 34:50.800
I was on
the Big Island last week.

34:50.867 --> 34:52.251
I didn't get back
until Saturday.

34:52.335 --> 34:53.936
You can check
with the hotel.

34:54.016 --> 34:54.962
Well, then who took the calls?

34:54.987 --> 34:56.786
Only person who
answers my calls

34:56.820 --> 34:58.037
is my secretary.

35:04.047 --> 35:05.598
She's gone.

35:11.585 --> 35:13.352
Suspect's name is
Chloe Ballantine.

35:13.420 --> 35:15.922
I need you to lock down
the entire building right away.

35:15.989 --> 35:17.573
Right now. Steve!

35:28.585 --> 35:32.205
Put your hands
on the wheel.

35:32.256 --> 35:33.439
Put your hands on the wheel.

35:39.263 --> 35:41.681
<i>Elliot wanted to be with me.</i>

35:41.748 --> 35:43.616
We were happy together.
But Jeff and Sheila

35:43.684 --> 35:44.801
ordered him to end the affair,

35:44.885 --> 35:46.219
and you couldn't
accept that, could you?

35:46.270 --> 35:48.120
How'd a local
girl like you

35:48.188 --> 35:50.656
get mixed up with a terrorist
like Mikhail, anyway?

35:55.946 --> 35:57.964
Take a look at this.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.116
Hey.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.501
Look at the photo.

36:01.568 --> 36:03.536
Look at the photo.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.273
His name was Amoka.
He had a daughter,

36:07.324 --> 36:08.975
and he had
grandchildren.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.943
And now he's dead
because of you.

36:18.552 --> 36:20.453
Mikhail
contacted our office

36:20.521 --> 36:22.955
looking to purchase a
certain product we make.

36:23.023 --> 36:24.924
But Legal did
a background check,

36:24.975 --> 36:27.126
and they refused
the purchase order.

36:27.177 --> 36:29.896
So a couple days later,
Mikhail calls the office,

36:29.963 --> 36:31.464
offers me $20,000.

36:32.533 --> 36:34.667
All I had to do
was fake some invoices.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.102
But instead of
taking the money,

36:36.169 --> 36:38.070
you asked him to commit murder.

36:38.138 --> 36:40.673
No. I took the cash, too.

36:42.142 --> 36:44.944
My, oh, my, aren't you
the opportunistic one.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.579
Let me ask you
something, though.

36:46.647 --> 36:47.914
Why sarin?

36:47.981 --> 36:50.182
There are plenty of easier ways
to kill people.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.817
That's why.

36:51.869 --> 36:53.819
That's why, isn't it?
Because it's big and it's bold.

36:53.887 --> 36:56.255
And you thought the cops would
think it was a terrorist attack,

36:56.323 --> 36:57.656
and they'd be
so busy dealing

36:57.708 --> 36:59.592
with mass panic that
they'd never think of murder.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.693
It's pretty well calculated,

37:00.794 --> 37:02.461
I got to say.

37:02.529 --> 37:04.163
You know what else?

37:04.214 --> 37:06.349
I don't think
you ever loved Elliot.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.568
Not at all.
He was a payday for you.

37:08.635 --> 37:09.852
In your twisted logic,

37:09.937 --> 37:11.637
Jeff and Sheila
were the only thing

37:11.688 --> 37:13.005
stopping you from cashing in.

37:13.073 --> 37:14.974
And with them
out of the way,

37:15.025 --> 37:16.642
Elliot could take control
of the company, right?

37:16.710 --> 37:18.277
And the two of you could be free

37:18.345 --> 37:19.545
to carry on your
relationship.

37:19.613 --> 37:22.014
He was gonna divorce his wife
and marry me.

37:22.082 --> 37:24.216
But what good was that
without money?

37:24.284 --> 37:26.385
Well, you know what?
Now you got nothing.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.521
Which is a real shame,
because, uh...

37:28.589 --> 37:31.591
you could do with that money
right now to pay for a lawyer.
