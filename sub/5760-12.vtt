My name is melinda gordon.

00:11.997 --> 00:14.664
I just got married.
Just moved to a small town.

00:14.731 --> 00:16.597
Just opened up
an antique shop.

00:16.664 --> 00:18.397
I might be just like you.

00:19.664 --> 00:21.364
Except from the time
that i was a little girl,

00:21.431 --> 00:23.531
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

00:24.597 --> 00:26.130
It's all right, honey.

00:26.197 --> 00:28.364
"Earthbound spirits"
my grandmother call them.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.698
They stay here because
they have unfinished business

00:31.764 --> 00:32.963
with the living,

00:33.030 --> 00:34.397
and they come to me
for help.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.531
To tell you my story,
i have to tell you theirs.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:59.364 --> 01:01.397
No. I can't.
I can't do it.

01:01.464 --> 01:02.897
[Laughing]
Yes, you can.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.596
You're gonna be fine
when you get out there.

01:04.664 --> 01:07.064
I won't. I am a coward.
I don't know
how i missed that.

01:07.130 --> 01:09.331
Will you stop it?
You are the bravest
woman i know.

01:09.397 --> 01:11.997
Now, take
a deep breath.

01:12.064 --> 01:13.064
A better one.

01:14.631 --> 01:16.130
Let's go out there.

01:22.164 --> 01:25.264
Ok, ok. Can i have
your attention, please?

01:25.331 --> 01:27.164
Uh... ok, ok.

01:27.230 --> 01:29.431
I need to get
everybody's attention.

01:29.497 --> 01:30.897
Uh, before we open

01:30.963 --> 01:33.930
the mic tonight, i have
a little announcement
to make.

01:33.997 --> 01:35.997
After 28 long years,

01:36.064 --> 01:37.930
the club will be closing.
Aw...
aw...

01:37.997 --> 01:39.230
see,

01:39.297 --> 01:41.197
the truth is,
i lost my lease.

01:41.264 --> 01:42.963
They want us
outta here.
Boo.

01:43.030 --> 01:44.297
Time to move on.

01:44.364 --> 01:46.997
But before we do,
we are gonna

01:47.064 --> 01:48.631
part-ay.

01:49.698 --> 01:50.698
That's right.

01:50.764 --> 01:52.664
Every night
for the next 2 weeks,

01:52.731 --> 01:55.331
we are gonna celebrate
the comedy cave...

01:55.397 --> 01:58.030
and some
of the biggest comics
in the business today.

01:58.097 --> 01:59.331
Yep.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.731
They will all be back
to say good-bye...

02:01.798 --> 02:02.897
louie kleinman,

02:02.963 --> 02:04.731
the santander twins,

02:04.798 --> 02:07.764
and on the 15th
and the 16th,

02:07.830 --> 02:09.663
sandra holloway.

02:12.331 --> 02:14.830
But w let's get down
to the business at hand.

02:14.897 --> 02:17.297
It is cold.
It's rainy outside.

02:17.364 --> 02:19.264
Must be open mic night.

02:19.331 --> 02:20.364
Yeah!

02:21.863 --> 02:23.597
Here we go.
First up...

02:23.664 --> 02:25.497
mr. Bryce avalon.

02:30.197 --> 02:32.431
Greetings, everybody.

02:32.497 --> 02:33.464
All right.
Whoo!

02:33.531 --> 02:35.030
Uh, the other day,

02:35.097 --> 02:36.564
i was in my basement,

02:36.631 --> 02:38.030
and i was eatin'
a can of spaghettl...

02:42.597 --> 02:44.130
Francie... what's
wrong with the mic?

02:44.197 --> 02:45.830
Why the mic so hot?

02:46.830 --> 02:48.397
You get the mic
from hell?

02:49.464 --> 02:50.698
Is there special
electronics

02:50.764 --> 02:52.863
in hell or somethin'?

02:52.930 --> 02:55.164
Don't try it tonight.
It's not your night.
What?

02:55.230 --> 02:57.297
There's a really
nasty ghost up there.

03:04.297 --> 03:05.664
I'm next.

03:05.731 --> 03:08.997
Just go
to the restroom,
ok? And... and fake

03:09.064 --> 03:10.830
stage fright
or something.
Trust me, you

03:10.897 --> 03:12.164
do not want
to go up there.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.331
Ok.

03:14.397 --> 03:15.731
That's what y'all
do now, francie?

03:15.798 --> 03:16.731
That how it is?

03:16.798 --> 03:17.930
What happened
to a hook

03:17.997 --> 03:20.397
or a horn
or... somethin'?

03:20.464 --> 03:21.731
Hey, francie,

03:21.798 --> 03:22.930
i think i'm
gonna really need

03:22.997 --> 03:24.097
some first aid up here.

03:24.164 --> 03:26.698
Ok, just...
keep drinking.

03:26.764 --> 03:28.798
I'll... i'll
figure it out.

03:28.863 --> 03:30.431
How many people'll
be willing to testify

03:30.497 --> 03:32.297
he set his own hand
on fire?

03:34.297 --> 03:35.297
Andrea?

03:37.297 --> 03:39.130
I went out
for a walk.

03:44.064 --> 03:45.331
Oh!
Melinda?

03:45.397 --> 03:47.631
Is the coast
clear?

03:47.698 --> 03:49.130
Uh...

03:49.197 --> 03:50.197
no.

03:53.863 --> 03:56.863
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:FRM-xxy
-=http://www.1000fr.com=-</font>

04:29.564 --> 04:32.497
uh... i'm gonna keep
the best stuff.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.998
Actually, uh,
andy kaufman left
a sleeping bag there.

04:36.063 --> 04:38.531
Yeah. But i'm...
but i'm sure
some of this stuff

04:38.597 --> 04:41.130
is worth selling.
L... i have bar glasses,

04:41.197 --> 04:43.430
i have cds, i have
signed photos.

04:43.497 --> 04:44.864
This stuff is great.
I mean,

04:44.931 --> 04:46.063
we've never had
anything like it.

04:46.130 --> 04:47.430
But are you sure
that you want to sell it?

04:48.964 --> 04:50.297
There's so many memories
here.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.697
Well, memories
are very romantic
when you're young.

04:52.764 --> 04:55.063
When you're my age,
they're like needles

04:55.130 --> 04:57.063
that stick
into your heart.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.197
So i'd rather
take the cash.

04:59.264 --> 05:02.631
So whatever you get,
i'll split it with you
50/50.

05:02.697 --> 05:06.631
Wow. You have mentored
so many people, francie.

05:06.697 --> 05:07.898
Yeah.

05:07.964 --> 05:10.097
Hmm. There's
a lot of history

05:10.163 --> 05:12.063
in that little club
of mine.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.998
You know, melinda
thinks the club
is haunted.

05:17.063 --> 05:18.531
I do not. A...

05:18.597 --> 05:20.163
haunted. [chuckles]

05:20.230 --> 05:22.364
That's a very strong word.

05:22.430 --> 05:25.397
Yes... it is...
haunted.

05:25.464 --> 05:26.397
Really.

05:26.464 --> 05:28.063
That's what
people say.

05:28.130 --> 05:30.597
Monday nights,
the club is closed.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.664
And our cleaning guy
swears that they come in,

05:33.731 --> 05:36.430
they rearrange the tables,
and they do their own show.

05:37.964 --> 05:39.497
But i'm not fooled.

05:39.564 --> 05:42.230
Being haunted...
very good for business.

05:42.297 --> 05:43.697
All right, girls.

05:43.764 --> 05:45.497
Let me know
how you do
with this stuff.

05:45.564 --> 05:47.597
Thanks.
I'll walk you out.

05:51.731 --> 05:53.764
Boy, she's a character,
isn't she?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.497
Hey, have you seen
my keys?

05:57.564 --> 06:00.330
I swear i put them
up here on the desk.

06:00.397 --> 06:01.330
Coat pocket?

06:05.664 --> 06:06.664
Hmm.

06:07.831 --> 06:09.597
Behold...

06:09.664 --> 06:11.230
your keys.

06:11.297 --> 06:13.097
Am i imagining it,

06:13.163 --> 06:15.163
or are they defying
the laws of physics?

06:23.197 --> 06:26.364
Andrea has nerves
of steel. I mean,

06:26.430 --> 06:28.297
i can't imagine
anything scarier

06:28.364 --> 06:29.964
than having to get up
in front of a bunch
of people

06:30.030 --> 06:31.464
and make 'em laugh.
Could you do that?

06:31.531 --> 06:34.063
Me? No. Heck,
i was linus

06:34.130 --> 06:35.531
in our third grade
production

06:35.597 --> 06:36.797
of <i>you're a good man,</i>
<i>charlie brown,</i>

06:36.864 --> 06:39.097
and i almost
threw up on snoopy.

06:40.297 --> 06:41.564
That's not about
our third grade play,

06:41.631 --> 06:42.564
now, is it?

06:42.631 --> 06:44.564
We're turning a profit.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.731
Th... the store
is turning a profit.
Really?

06:46.797 --> 06:48.130
Congratulations.
Yeah! [laughs]

06:48.197 --> 06:49.898
It's right there
in black and white.

06:49.964 --> 06:51.898
We should celebrate.
My treat.

06:51.964 --> 06:53.964
Congratulations.
[Laughs]

06:54.030 --> 06:56.430
Oh, i have to call
andrea. She is
going to <i>freak.</i>

06:56.497 --> 06:57.497
All right.

07:08.397 --> 07:10.330
So, you know, i mean,
i was just thinkin'
ahead here,

07:10.397 --> 07:12.230
but, you know,
maybe we should
expand.

07:12.297 --> 07:14.264
Oh, andrea, it's
one month's profit.

07:14.330 --> 07:15.430
We're not
wal-mart yet.

07:15.497 --> 07:18.497
That's it.
We should franchise.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.931
Ok. I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

07:23.998 --> 07:25.297
and say that that
was ghost-related.

07:25.364 --> 07:26.297
That's not funny.

07:26.364 --> 07:27.297
I wasn't joking.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.631
Not you. Him.
You are messing

07:28.697 --> 07:30.130
with
the wrong person, pal.

07:30.197 --> 07:32.931
[Sighs] can't
we just ignore
this guy and maybe

07:32.998 --> 07:33.931
he'll go away?

07:33.998 --> 07:35.130
That's always
my first plan.

07:35.197 --> 07:36.130
Never works.

07:36.197 --> 07:38.564
Well... where
did he come from?

07:38.631 --> 07:41.464
My guess is he's attached
to one of these things
of the comedy club.

07:41.531 --> 07:43.797
He was in my house
last night. Rearranged
my furniture.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.330
Really! How'd it look?

07:45.397 --> 07:47.063
Not bad, except
for the arm chair

07:47.130 --> 07:48.664
balancing
on the coffee table.

07:48.731 --> 07:51.130
So... how do we get
rid of this joker?

07:51.197 --> 07:53.497
I guess he'll
eventually get bored
and show himself.

07:53.564 --> 07:55.464
Ok.

08:03.764 --> 08:07.497
Melinda... i, uh, think
you'd better... see this.

08:15.998 --> 08:18.264
I hate this guy.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.898
I think it's time
to pay francie a visit

08:34.697 --> 08:36.297
Mondays.

09:03.264 --> 09:05.631
...transplan
when the transplant
does not work out,

09:05.697 --> 09:07.697
right? His body
has rejected...

09:30.664 --> 09:33.130
Uh, we don't serve
your kind here, honey.

09:34.497 --> 09:36.097
What are you all
doing here?

09:36.163 --> 09:38.097
How come
you can see us?

09:38.163 --> 09:39.464
Just lucky, i guess.

09:39.531 --> 09:42.030
Why haven't you all
crossed over?

09:42.097 --> 09:43.297
We like it in front
of the light.

09:43.364 --> 09:44.597
Who knows
what's behind it?

09:44.664 --> 09:46.831
Besides, they love us
here, right?

09:46.898 --> 09:48.230
Oh, bein' dead.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.764
Is it just me,
or do your clothes
fit better?

09:50.831 --> 09:51.998
Deb agrees with me.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.998
When my wife asks me
to take out the garbage,

09:54.063 --> 09:55.597
i finally have
a good excuse.

09:55.664 --> 09:57.731
Sorry, honey...
rigor mortis.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.130
Can we please stop?
I'm looking for someone.

10:01.197 --> 10:04.063
Uh, he's one of you...
a comic, i guess.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.831
Oh, that really
narrows it down.
[Laughter]

10:05.898 --> 10:09.197
H-he's 28. um...
really into

10:09.264 --> 10:10.964
practical jokes.
And tennis and

10:11.030 --> 10:12.631
long walks
on the beach.

10:12.697 --> 10:14.697
Shut up, bob.
What does he look like?

10:14.764 --> 10:17.831
I haven't really
seen him. Just a...
a flash. Dark hair.

10:17.898 --> 10:20.664
Um, he haunts the club
when it's open.

10:20.731 --> 10:22.464
Um, marty.

10:22.531 --> 10:24.130
Marty golden.

10:24.197 --> 10:25.998
All right!
I remember him.

10:26.063 --> 10:27.531
Oh, yeah.
Marty.

10:27.597 --> 10:29.030
Yeah,
very conceptual.

10:29.097 --> 10:30.364
Always took things
to the next level.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.831
Yeah. Remember the night
when he made the audience

10:31.898 --> 10:33.831
wear oxygen masks?
Told 'em there was gonna

10:33.898 --> 10:35.831
be a big chemical attack?
Right! Ha ha ha!

10:37.063 --> 10:39.197
He was unique,
that's for sure.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.497
What happened to him?

10:40.564 --> 10:41.797
The kid had
problems.

10:41.864 --> 10:43.297
He couldn't get
arrested. And
he was great.

10:43.364 --> 10:44.731
He had
a tremendous
talent.

10:44.797 --> 10:46.597
Very original,
but that doesn't
always mean

10:46.664 --> 10:48.063
you're gonna
make it.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.163
Anyway, to make
a long story short...

10:50.230 --> 10:51.564
too late.
Yes, dan.

10:51.631 --> 10:53.364
Just 'cause we
have all eternity
doesn't mean

10:53.430 --> 10:55.531
we want to spend it
listenin' to this story.

10:55.597 --> 10:56.998
Yeah, well,
go take a shower,
and i'll finish.

10:57.063 --> 10:59.430
[Laughter]
Ha ha ha.

10:59.497 --> 11:01.330
Anyway,
one night he walks
out of the club.

11:01.397 --> 11:04.531
He was really down,
depressed, feelin'
sorry for himself.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.831
And?

11:05.898 --> 11:07.864
That's it. We never
saw him again.

11:07.931 --> 11:10.063
Yeah. He must've
signed with my agent.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.464
Oh.

11:13.531 --> 11:15.130
Right.

11:15.197 --> 11:16.330
Well, thank you...

11:16.397 --> 11:17.631
for your help.
Remember, folks,

11:17.697 --> 11:19.197
be good to your...
seriously.

11:21.230 --> 11:22.497
Man: Every monday!

11:23.564 --> 11:24.998
I love dead people.

11:25.063 --> 11:26.330
I love you.

11:42.697 --> 11:43.898
So she says to me,

11:43.964 --> 11:47.764
"marty, you've got to look
at the big picture.

11:47.831 --> 11:49.664
"In a hundred years,
none of this will matter,

11:49.731 --> 11:51.831
and we'll all be dead."

11:51.898 --> 11:53.731
All new people.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.464
Isn't it beautiful?

11:57.230 --> 11:58.931
So i fired her.
What, are you
kidding me?

11:58.998 --> 12:01.731
I don't need to take
that kind of crap
from a therapist.

12:04.797 --> 12:06.998
I mean, really.
That's what we pay 'em
for, right?

12:07.063 --> 12:09.898
Subsidized denial.

12:09.964 --> 12:12.430
But you know,
she's right.

12:12.497 --> 12:14.063
I mean, let's face it...

12:14.130 --> 12:17.097
we're all gonna die.

12:17.163 --> 12:19.130
Oh, yeah. Sure, we are.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.797
Yeah.

12:20.864 --> 12:23.063
<i>You're</i> gonna die...

12:23.130 --> 12:24.631
and you're gonna die...
[echo] gonna die...

12:24.697 --> 12:26.063
and you're gonna die.
You're not funny.
Come on!

12:26.130 --> 12:27.697
And you, sir,
in the back,
boo!

12:27.764 --> 12:29.597
Stuffing your face
with the cheeseburger,

12:29.664 --> 12:31.330
are going to die.
Get off the stage.

12:31.397 --> 12:33.831
Yeah, let's...
let's just say it
all together.
Boo!

12:33.898 --> 12:36.597
Ready? Ok.
Boo!
Boo!

12:36.664 --> 12:39.931
I'm... gonna... die!

12:39.998 --> 12:42.831
die! Die!

12:48.831 --> 12:50.197
Am i dead?

12:57.931 --> 12:59.164
I asked you a question.

13:00.164 --> 13:02.463
Am i dead?

13:02.530 --> 13:05.298
Um... very.

13:06.330 --> 13:09.564
Um... what's
with all the water?

13:09.630 --> 13:11.897
I mean,
the... fish tank,

13:11.964 --> 13:14.397
the restroom?

13:14.463 --> 13:16.397
My floor.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.597
I don't know.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.931
I can't
figure it out.

13:19.997 --> 13:22.897
One minute,
i'm dying figuratively
at the club,

13:22.964 --> 13:25.630
and the next...
well, what's the last
thing you remember?

13:25.697 --> 13:26.697
It's hard to say.

13:28.463 --> 13:31.064
I remember...
feeling...

13:32.097 --> 13:33.097
hopeful.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.931
But also
something really bad.

13:36.997 --> 13:39.430
Well, the thing is,
usually...

13:39.497 --> 13:41.964
when i see spirits,
they look normal.

13:42.031 --> 13:45.064
So, what are you sayin'?
I look as bad as i feel?

13:45.131 --> 13:47.097
I'm telling you
that when a spirit
comes to me

13:47.164 --> 13:49.131
looking like you do,
it usually means

13:49.198 --> 13:51.330
that they've had
a sudden or very
violent death.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.564
Which is also why
you don't remember.

13:53.630 --> 13:54.931
So, what do i do?

13:56.931 --> 13:58.664
Well, you're
in the wrong place now.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.664
You need to cross over.

14:00.730 --> 14:02.864
Oh, yeah. My agent
said the same thing,

14:02.931 --> 14:05.530
but... i never needed
to appeal to everyone.

14:05.597 --> 14:08.764
I meant cross over
to the other side.

14:08.831 --> 14:13.497
Look. This all feels like
a really big mistake.

14:13.564 --> 14:17.630
Ok? Now, i have to
find out what happened to me.

14:18.730 --> 14:20.664
Will you help me?

14:39.964 --> 14:41.198
Ohh!
Sorry.

14:41.264 --> 14:42.198
Ohhh...

14:42.264 --> 14:44.131
uh, the door
was open, so...

14:44.198 --> 14:45.530
no, it's all right.
Come on in.

14:45.597 --> 14:47.497
Um, i just wanted
to talk to you

14:47.564 --> 14:49.831
about a cd
that i listened to
last night.

14:49.897 --> 14:51.330
It really
made me laugh.

14:51.397 --> 14:53.664
Well, good.
Who was it?

14:53.730 --> 14:55.463
Marty golden.

14:55.530 --> 14:56.764
Yeah.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.264
He's kind of a sore subject
around here.

15:01.997 --> 15:03.463
How come?

15:03.530 --> 15:05.231
[Sighs] well...

15:06.864 --> 15:10.131
well, marty, uh,
marty was the real deal.

15:10.198 --> 15:11.430
An original.

15:11.497 --> 15:13.097
Very complicated guy.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.264
You either loved him
or you hated him.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.564
And you?

15:17.630 --> 15:19.330
Did you love him
or hate him?

15:21.164 --> 15:22.164
Yeah.

15:23.330 --> 15:25.764
I guess it kinda
depended on the day.

15:25.831 --> 15:28.730
Couldn't do either one
for too long.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.764
He, uh... he came
to the club one night...

15:33.831 --> 15:36.264
he left, and no one
ever saw him again.

15:36.330 --> 15:39.530
Just about destroyed
anybody who ever
cared about him.

15:40.730 --> 15:42.630
And i'm not talking
about mommy or daddy,

15:42.697 --> 15:45.897
because they'd
written him off
years ago.

15:45.964 --> 15:48.797
I'm talkin' about
his real family...

15:48.864 --> 15:50.031
here.

15:52.363 --> 15:53.864
Especially sandra.

15:55.131 --> 15:56.497
Poor kid.

15:57.497 --> 15:58.430
Sandra?

15:58.497 --> 16:00.397
I really, um...

16:00.463 --> 16:03.397
i can't talk
about this right now.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.397
I, um... i have
this mountain of paperwork

16:06.463 --> 16:08.430
i have to get
to my accountant, so...

16:08.497 --> 16:09.497
ok.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.430
So, does marty know
you've seen francie?

16:18.497 --> 16:20.630
Marty hasn't really
come around today, but

16:20.697 --> 16:22.764
francie said
when he disappeared,

16:22.831 --> 16:24.797
his friend sandra
took it the hardest.

16:24.864 --> 16:25.964
Hmm.

16:26.031 --> 16:28.198
Um... sandra holloway?
Have you seen her?

16:28.264 --> 16:29.597
Yeah. She was
on <i>letterman</i>
a couple weeks ago.

16:29.664 --> 16:30.697
She's fine.

16:30.764 --> 16:31.697
She's performing
at the comedy cave

16:31.764 --> 16:32.797
next weekend.
You wanna go?

16:32.864 --> 16:34.764
Yeah. And i'll spring
for that one.

16:34.831 --> 16:36.931
Oh, no need.
We're practically
rolling in it.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.264
Look...

16:38.330 --> 16:40.031
how much money exactly
are we talkin' about?

16:40.097 --> 16:41.530
I'm thinkin' about
havin' it framed.

16:41.597 --> 16:42.831
Oh, yeah? Wow.

16:42.897 --> 16:44.097
Check the comma...

16:44.164 --> 16:45.831
where the decimal point
usually goes.

16:45.897 --> 16:46.831
Here.

16:46.897 --> 16:47.897
Wow.

16:49.298 --> 16:50.864
I'm proud of you.
I give it up.

16:50.931 --> 16:52.797
Yeah, well...
who's your mama now?

16:52.864 --> 16:54.897
You.
So, i'm walkin'
down the street
the other day,

16:54.964 --> 16:57.463
and i see this guy,
and he's wearing
capri pants

16:57.530 --> 16:59.964
for men. The dude
was a mansaster.

17:00.031 --> 17:02.897
[Chuckles] manprise.

17:02.964 --> 17:05.797
I'm trying to be original,
thank you very much.

17:05.864 --> 17:08.064
God, everybody's a critic.

17:08.131 --> 17:10.564
Hey, so, was jim excited
that we're finally

17:10.630 --> 17:12.164
makin' some money
around here?

17:12.231 --> 17:13.896
Yeah.
He was happy.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.131
A little weird.

17:15.198 --> 17:16.830
Oh, you think
it bothers him?

17:16.896 --> 17:20.363
Jim? No way.
He's too evolved
for that.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.931
Right. Most men are.

17:24.263 --> 17:25.263
She's funny.

17:25.329 --> 17:26.363
What?

17:26.430 --> 17:28.198
She's good.

17:28.263 --> 17:29.864
She could
slow down
a little.

17:31.831 --> 17:32.764
Who's here?

17:32.831 --> 17:33.864
Speaking of critics...

17:33.931 --> 17:36.363
huh. Is this
our friend marty

17:36.430 --> 17:39.031
who thinks it's funny
to break glasses?

17:39.097 --> 17:41.031
One and the same.

17:41.097 --> 17:42.031
Have fun.

17:47.097 --> 17:48.264
You know...

17:49.764 --> 17:51.031
you look better.

17:51.097 --> 17:53.630
Why, thank you.
I've been dieting.
[Chuckles]

17:53.697 --> 17:55.797
I <i>feel</i> better.

17:55.864 --> 17:58.298
Well, it happens. Once
you start to interact
with this world,

17:58.363 --> 18:00.031
you start to look
a little bit
like your old self.

18:04.397 --> 18:06.831
Do you remember sandra?

18:06.897 --> 18:08.397
Sandra holloway?

18:09.530 --> 18:10.497
Sandra.

18:15.164 --> 18:17.430
Yeah, i do.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.997
You loved her,
didn't you?

18:20.231 --> 18:22.463
[Sighs] let's just say

18:22.530 --> 18:24.864
we understood
each other very well.

18:24.931 --> 18:27.198
She's gonna be here
tomorrow.

18:30.864 --> 18:32.330
She's performing
at the comedy cave.

18:35.363 --> 18:36.864
What really happened?

18:38.530 --> 18:40.831
I don't remember
exactly, but

18:40.897 --> 18:44.298
it... feels like
a lot of pain.

18:45.864 --> 18:47.497
Do you want me
to help you talk to her?

18:47.564 --> 18:48.630
Talk to her?

18:48.697 --> 18:50.363
You would do that?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.363
Will that help you
move on?

18:53.564 --> 18:55.198
What if i did
something bad to her?

18:57.031 --> 18:58.131
If you really want
to know what happened

18:58.198 --> 18:59.931
to you...
will you...

18:59.997 --> 19:02.497
will you
go see her first?

19:09.664 --> 19:11.330
Are you sure this is
where she'd be staying?

19:11.397 --> 19:13.964
This is usually
where comics crash
when they come to town.

19:14.031 --> 19:16.097
I don't know. Maybe
this is a bad idea.

19:16.164 --> 19:17.198
Well...

19:17.264 --> 19:18.530
you stay here,
and i'll go up.

19:21.497 --> 19:22.997
That's her.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.363
I always... wanted
to make her laugh.

19:29.597 --> 19:32.697
It was the hardest
damn thing to do.

19:39.031 --> 19:40.231
W-where's she goin'?

19:41.231 --> 19:44.164
Uh... let's find out.

20:24.064 --> 20:25.231
What's she doing?

20:53.264 --> 20:54.997
[Whispering]
Here's to you, baby.

21:22.397 --> 21:23.397
What?

21:26.231 --> 21:28.064
This is where
it happened.

21:32.730 --> 21:34.897
This is where
i killed myself.

21:46.297 --> 21:47.897
On this bridge.

21:47.964 --> 21:49.564
This is
where it happened.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.430
This is where
i killed myself.

22:07.564 --> 22:09.230
I knew the minute
i stepped off

22:09.297 --> 22:11.964
that... i made a mistake.

22:14.297 --> 22:16.764
And in that moment, i...

22:19.764 --> 22:21.397
i felt so alive.

22:22.397 --> 22:23.731
I felt everything.

22:23.797 --> 22:26.364
I couldn't help
but appreciate
the irony, you know?

22:26.430 --> 22:28.864
All this time
and effort to try
and feel nothing,

22:28.931 --> 22:30.764
to make myself numb,
but...

22:32.098 --> 22:34.130
in those last seconds...

22:34.197 --> 22:36.297
i felt it all...

22:36.364 --> 22:37.430
realized...

22:40.597 --> 22:42.130
i loved it.

22:47.263 --> 22:50.597
And then i couldn't
believe i was about to...

22:50.664 --> 22:52.731
feel nothing ever again.

22:54.230 --> 22:56.697
My heart broke
into a hundred pieces

22:56.764 --> 22:58.897
before the water
ever stopped it.

23:03.731 --> 23:07.764
And a... 9.5, 9.6,

23:07.831 --> 23:09.597
and from the french
judge,

23:09.664 --> 23:12.031
he gives old marty
a 7.5.

23:12.098 --> 23:13.098
Why?

23:14.664 --> 23:17.597
Why did you do this
to yourself?

23:21.697 --> 23:22.831
I don't know.

23:26.297 --> 23:28.397
You don't supposed
i can undo it, do you?

23:32.230 --> 23:34.731
I wish we all could,
but we only get one shot.

23:37.064 --> 23:39.631
You have to figure out
why you did this to yourself.

23:41.897 --> 23:44.064
You'll never have
any peace if you don't.

23:56.530 --> 23:58.697
So, i, um,
i made a decision.

23:58.764 --> 24:01.130
Please tell me
that it's not
to put your end down.

24:01.197 --> 24:03.731
No. I'm gonna give
open mic another shot.

24:03.797 --> 24:05.130
I'm gonna go see
francie tonight

24:05.197 --> 24:06.430
and see if she'll
give me another chance.

24:06.497 --> 24:08.031
Oh, that's
a great idea.
Hey, you know what?

24:08.098 --> 24:09.497
When you see francie,
can you get her

24:09.564 --> 24:10.897
to tell you more
about marty and sandra?

24:10.964 --> 24:12.998
'Cause i kinda hit
a wall with her.

24:13.064 --> 24:15.631
Yeah, i'll try.
I'm actually really
curious myself.

24:15.697 --> 24:16.697
Oh.

24:16.764 --> 24:17.697
Um...
ask

24:17.764 --> 24:19.130
and you shall receive.

24:19.197 --> 24:20.130
Melinda: Hi.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.964
Hi.

24:22.031 --> 24:24.464
I was told you're selling
the comedy cave stuff...

24:24.530 --> 24:26.430
marty golden cds,
posters...

24:26.497 --> 24:27.564
yeah.
It's on display
over there

24:27.631 --> 24:28.864
and some
in the window.
Oh, great.

24:28.931 --> 24:30.364
I'll take it all.

24:30.430 --> 24:31.530
All?

24:31.597 --> 24:34.064
Yes. Please.

24:37.397 --> 24:39.397
That should cover it,
i think.

24:39.464 --> 24:41.864
I think! Yeah. Yes.

24:41.931 --> 24:43.430
Please box it up
for me.

24:43.497 --> 24:45.364
I'll have
someone come by
and pick it up.

24:46.564 --> 24:48.530
Uh...

24:48.597 --> 24:50.664
sandra holloway
bought it all?

24:50.731 --> 24:51.664
Yeah.

24:51.731 --> 24:53.197
She was really interested

24:53.263 --> 24:54.697
in the marty golden
items.

24:54.764 --> 24:57.597
Hmm. Here.
Make yourself useful.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.697
One on each table.

24:59.764 --> 25:03.197
So, what ever happened
with marty and sandra,
anyway?

25:03.263 --> 25:05.897
Well, she owes him
a lot.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.998
She knows it.
First time sandra

25:08.064 --> 25:10.564
came in here,
she was like a deer
in the headlights.

25:11.964 --> 25:14.697
Marty: So this cop
pulls me over
the other day.

25:15.964 --> 25:19.364
Francie: Sandra always
had great material.

25:19.430 --> 25:22.464
But she never had
the nerve to stand up there
and go for it.

25:24.197 --> 25:26.064
Her fear, her talent...

25:27.364 --> 25:30.297
i think he saw
some of himself in her.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.130
He wanted to help her
the way he couldn't seem
to help himself.

25:33.197 --> 25:34.464
So, i'm drivin'
the other day, and...

25:34.530 --> 25:37.064
but after the first night
he pulled her up there,

25:37.130 --> 25:38.697
it all changed.

25:38.764 --> 25:40.731
The crowd loved her.

25:40.797 --> 25:43.597
She really took off
for real.

25:46.263 --> 25:49.430
They fed off each other...
in the best ways

25:49.497 --> 25:52.197
and in the worst ways.

25:52.263 --> 25:54.297
They couldn't be
without each other.

25:55.664 --> 25:57.364
They were like
vampires in love...

25:57.430 --> 25:59.697
live by night,
sleep by day.

25:59.764 --> 26:01.064
Then he disappeared.

26:01.130 --> 26:03.864
No explanation
at all? Just gone?

26:03.931 --> 26:08.464
<i>Nada.</i> they didn't find
a body or signs of anything.

26:08.530 --> 26:12.064
[Sighs] she didn't
leave her apartment
for 2 months.

26:12.130 --> 26:14.831
Wow. Do you think
she's still...

26:14.897 --> 26:18.197
oh, enough. Let's
not talk about it.
How about you?

26:18.263 --> 26:19.831
Ready to give it
another shot?

26:19.897 --> 26:21.597
Yes. L... i am
gonna sign up

26:21.664 --> 26:22.931
for open mic
next week.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.064
Well, good!

26:24.130 --> 26:26.897
Don't punk out
on me this time.

26:46.897 --> 26:47.897
I know.

26:50.163 --> 26:51.564
Know what?

27:06.931 --> 27:08.064
Europe. She left me

27:08.131 --> 27:09.263
to go to europe.

27:09.330 --> 27:11.098
What are you talking about?

27:14.931 --> 27:16.931
I couldn't get
any traction.

27:16.997 --> 27:19.263
I couldn't get
out of that club.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.697
Sandra started
to get tv gigs.

27:21.764 --> 27:23.864
And when i tried,
they said i didn't
test well.

27:23.931 --> 27:26.564
They said my material
was too cerebral
for a young audience.

27:26.630 --> 27:29.630
I was outraged.
Even after i looked up
the word "cerebral,"

27:29.697 --> 27:31.464
i couldn't agree.

27:31.530 --> 27:33.031
And that tour...

27:33.098 --> 27:34.864
it was gonna turn it
all around for her.

27:34.931 --> 27:36.363
She was gonna become a star.

27:36.430 --> 27:37.964
We'll never make it.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.997
You know, i thought
you would kinda
be happy for me.

27:41.064 --> 27:42.997
We won't make it,
sandy.

27:43.064 --> 27:44.964
We'll never last
that long apart.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.530
You know what? If this
were happening to you,

27:46.597 --> 27:48.263
i would be
cheering for you.
No.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.031
No. You wouldn't.
You would be afraid

27:50.098 --> 27:51.230
that i would
never come back.

27:51.297 --> 27:53.297
I have to do this.
It's my shot,

27:53.363 --> 27:54.797
and i have to take it.

27:54.864 --> 27:56.731
It sounds to me
like you already
made up your mind.

27:56.797 --> 27:57.731
Well, m...
yeah.

27:57.797 --> 27:59.230
Look,
i'm not leaving you.

27:59.297 --> 28:00.597
I'm just going away.

28:00.664 --> 28:02.797
Yeah. It's
the same damn thing,
right?

28:02.864 --> 28:04.564
No.
Ok.

28:06.430 --> 28:09.964
Just... the thought
of sandra gone so long and...

28:10.031 --> 28:13.131
knowing that she'd be
over there with the best

28:13.198 --> 28:14.897
while i was stuck here?
You know?

28:14.964 --> 28:16.731
The guy
who doesn't test well.

28:16.797 --> 28:19.297
How come nobody knows
what happened to you?

28:23.497 --> 28:24.664
Now, that...

28:24.731 --> 28:26.430
is a fitting coda
for my life.

28:26.497 --> 28:29.363
Failed comedian
makes dramatic exit,

28:29.430 --> 28:31.098
but nobody notices.

28:31.164 --> 28:32.464
Everybody noticed,
marty.

28:35.430 --> 28:37.664
You broke their hearts.

28:41.098 --> 28:42.530
I know.

28:44.363 --> 28:46.064
I know, i know, i know.

28:47.564 --> 28:49.397
[Snickers]
I was stupid.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.597
Cerebral,
my ass.

28:55.897 --> 28:57.964
You have to make it
right for sandra.

29:01.064 --> 29:03.397
I mean, think about all
that she's been carrying
around with her.

29:03.464 --> 29:04.964
I'll help you.

29:05.031 --> 29:08.263
[Sighs] i don't know
that i can face her yet.

29:10.564 --> 29:11.997
Ok.

29:12.064 --> 29:14.464
Then let's start
with francie.

29:14.530 --> 29:16.697
He wants to say
thank you...

29:16.764 --> 29:19.864
for letting him
stay on your couch...

29:19.931 --> 29:22.198
for giving him a chance,
for believing in him.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.098
For never
giving up on him.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.330
I c... i can't
believe this.

29:28.397 --> 29:31.064
He killed himself?

29:31.131 --> 29:32.964
He wants you to know
that he's sorry.

29:34.297 --> 29:35.697
He sees me?

29:36.697 --> 29:37.764
Hears me?

29:38.764 --> 29:39.997
How?

29:40.064 --> 29:42.697
Everybody
has a talent.

29:42.764 --> 29:43.697
This is mine.

29:43.764 --> 29:45.530
I never meant
to hurt anyone,

29:45.597 --> 29:47.363
least of all her.

29:47.430 --> 29:50.198
He wants you to know
that he never meant
to hurt anyone.

29:52.098 --> 29:53.964
Is that right.

29:54.031 --> 29:56.131
Then why the hell'd
you do it?!

29:57.630 --> 29:58.864
He wanted
to hurt <i>himself.</i>

29:58.931 --> 30:02.031
Bull, marty.
You hurt yourself
for 2 minutes.

30:02.098 --> 30:03.764
You hurt the people
who loved you

30:03.831 --> 30:05.731
for the rest of their lives.
Is that what you wanted?

30:05.797 --> 30:07.731
Are you happy <i>now?!</i>

30:07.797 --> 30:10.530
[Sighs] look...
i would take it back
if i could.

30:10.597 --> 30:13.230
Do you know
how many people
believed in you?

30:13.297 --> 30:16.797
Do you know that l...
<i>i</i> loved you?

30:18.397 --> 30:20.497
I loved you like my son.

30:20.564 --> 30:23.098
Could you please just...
you... ask her to stop?

30:23.164 --> 30:24.363
I can't take it.

30:24.430 --> 30:25.664
Is he still there?

30:25.731 --> 30:27.997
Yes. And he knows
that you're right.

30:29.263 --> 30:31.330
And do you know
what you did to sandra?

30:32.397 --> 30:34.098
You shouldn't be here
crying to me.

30:34.164 --> 30:37.597
You need... you need
to let her know
that this was not

30:37.664 --> 30:38.664
her fault.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.430
You need
to set her free, pal.

30:43.497 --> 30:45.597
She has lost a lot...

30:47.597 --> 30:50.164
that she will
never, ever get back.

30:53.263 --> 30:54.697
He will.

30:56.764 --> 30:58.530
You tell him
i'm just too angry

30:58.597 --> 31:00.297
to talk to him right now.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.297
[Tearfully]
I miss him.

31:10.330 --> 31:11.864
You tell him...

31:11.931 --> 31:14.997
i will never forget him.

31:17.131 --> 31:18.864
You just told him.

31:21.997 --> 31:22.997
Well...

31:24.997 --> 31:28.397
what <i>is</i> that i...
i feel?

31:28.464 --> 31:29.797
He's hugging you.

31:33.164 --> 31:34.330
[Tearfully]
Oh...

31:36.330 --> 31:39.330
oh... marty...

31:42.997 --> 31:44.597
we were family.

31:47.263 --> 31:49.098
You don't leave
when you're family.

31:57.964 --> 32:00.297
I thank you!
Thank you!

32:19.131 --> 32:20.131
Yes?

32:22.630 --> 32:24.297
Sorry to bother you.

32:24.363 --> 32:26.997
Uh, i just wanted to say
that i really enjoyed
your performance.

32:27.064 --> 32:29.897
You're the girl
from the store.

32:29.964 --> 32:31.397
Right.

32:31.464 --> 32:32.997
Melinda gordon.

32:33.064 --> 32:34.297
Come on in.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.330
Don't tell her
i'm here yet. She'll
never believe you.

32:39.397 --> 32:40.664
You want something
to drink?

32:40.731 --> 32:41.997
No. Thanks.

32:44.931 --> 32:50.131
Uh, i was also a...
a fan of marty golden's,
too.

32:50.198 --> 32:53.397
L... i know that you two
were close. [chuckles]

32:53.464 --> 32:57.363
"Close."
Very interesting way
of putting it.

32:57.430 --> 33:00.464
I'm sorry. It's
none of my business.

33:00.530 --> 33:02.797
I'm glad <i>somebody</i>
remembers marty.

33:02.864 --> 33:05.697
You wanna know a secret?

33:05.764 --> 33:07.764
It should've been
marty who made it.

33:07.831 --> 33:09.764
He was the real deal.

33:10.931 --> 33:12.897
Compared to him,
i'm just a fraud.

33:12.964 --> 33:15.297
If he were still here,
if he were still alive,

33:15.363 --> 33:16.864
it'd be him out there...

33:16.931 --> 33:17.931
not me.

33:19.131 --> 33:22.297
So you're sure
he's dead. How?

33:23.297 --> 33:25.131
Because i feel
dead, too.

33:26.131 --> 33:27.797
Have ever since
that night.

33:30.630 --> 33:32.098
Do you think marty
killed himself

33:32.164 --> 33:34.064
because you left
to go on tour?

33:34.131 --> 33:36.664
How do <i>you</i> know
he killed himself?

33:36.731 --> 33:39.230
L... i just assumed.

33:39.297 --> 33:42.363
Well, he didn't kill himself
because i went on tour.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.240
????????

33:59.733 --> 34:00.833
I don't understand.
I thought the tour

34:00.900 --> 34:02.634
was supposed to be
your big break.

34:03.733 --> 34:05.134
That's what everyone
kept telling me.

34:06.201 --> 34:10.301
Except the one guy
i needed to hear it
from most.

34:10.367 --> 34:13.034
I started
second-guessing myself.

34:13.100 --> 34:16.000
Maybe marty was right.
Maybe we couldn't
survive the separation.

34:16.067 --> 34:18.900
I didn't want
to lose him.

34:18.967 --> 34:21.234
Marty was struggling.
Boo!
Boo!

34:21.301 --> 34:23.367
He needed me
more than ever.

34:23.434 --> 34:24.568
Boo!
Boo!

34:24.634 --> 34:27.201
And i'd have other chances,
other breaks.

34:27.266 --> 34:30.234
But would i ever have
someone i love as much?

34:32.634 --> 34:35.400
So i decided
not to take the tour.

34:35.467 --> 34:36.867
And when i told him...

34:36.934 --> 34:40.333
i thought that he'd be
happy or at least relieved.

34:42.134 --> 34:44.266
But instead,
he just seemed...

34:44.333 --> 34:47.134
defeated, like he had
taken something from me.

34:48.668 --> 34:50.766
I'll never forget
how tight he held me.

34:54.766 --> 34:57.501
That was the last time
i ever saw him.

34:57.568 --> 35:00.201
Then he jumped
off driscoll bridge.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.668
How did you know that?

35:03.733 --> 35:05.201
What was it
about that bridge?

35:05.267 --> 35:08.367
Ok, you're
creeping me out now.

35:08.434 --> 35:12.067
Are you, like, one
of these obsessed
conspiracy people?

35:12.134 --> 35:13.267
Oh, i'm sorry.

35:13.334 --> 35:14.900
Marty:
I'm remembering
everything now.

35:14.967 --> 35:16.201
I have to talk to her.

35:16.267 --> 35:18.201
Marty saw that you
were gonna be a star.

35:18.267 --> 35:20.201
And... and he felt
like he was
pulling you down,

35:20.267 --> 35:22.067
and then when you said
that you weren't gonna
do the tour,

35:22.134 --> 35:23.900
he thought he was
ruining you.

35:23.967 --> 35:27.267
Jumping off that bridge
was marty's way
of setting you free.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.067
Ok, who the hell
are you?

35:29.134 --> 35:31.134
How do you know this?!
How do you know marty?!

35:31.201 --> 35:33.568
He's here with us
right now.
He can hear you.

35:34.833 --> 35:35.833
Get out.

35:38.601 --> 35:40.301
Get out!

35:42.668 --> 35:44.201
So, are you nervous
about tonight?

35:44.267 --> 35:47.334
No! What?! No.
Nervous? Why
would i be nervous?

35:50.267 --> 35:52.568
Ahem. You jumping
like that...

35:52.634 --> 35:54.434
that was you...
not nervous?

35:58.434 --> 36:00.100
Why aren't you
at the club?

36:01.767 --> 36:03.201
Look, i just...

36:04.601 --> 36:06.833
i don't believe
in any of this crap
about ghosts.

36:06.900 --> 36:07.833
I just don't.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.334
You and
a million others.

36:11.934 --> 36:13.234
Andrea:
Ok, i'm, uh...

36:13.301 --> 36:14.267
i'm, uh,
i'm gonna go home

36:14.334 --> 36:16.000
and hyperventilate
for a while,

36:16.067 --> 36:17.601
and i'll...
i'll see you
at the club.

36:23.467 --> 36:24.967
But if i did...

36:26.134 --> 36:28.733
if i did believe
that marty was here...

36:28.800 --> 36:31.501
i would
tell him how stupid
what he did was.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.301
I've been living
with this for 2 years,

36:34.367 --> 36:37.167
feeling responsible,
like i took something
from the world.

36:37.234 --> 36:38.501
It is not your fault.

36:38.568 --> 36:39.800
You think
i don't know that?

36:39.867 --> 36:41.833
But i <i>feel</i> it.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.234
My heart is wrecked, marty!

36:45.568 --> 36:46.800
I'm sorry.

36:46.867 --> 36:47.934
He's sorry.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.668
Not as sorry as i am.

36:49.733 --> 36:51.234
No. I'm sorrier.

36:52.900 --> 36:57.367
Ok. Ask her how
she knew i jumped
off the bridge.

36:57.434 --> 37:00.134
He wants to know
how you knew
about the bridge.

37:00.201 --> 37:01.800
Now i know you're lying.

37:01.867 --> 37:03.867
Marty would know the answer
to that question.

37:03.934 --> 37:05.334
What am i doing here?

37:05.401 --> 37:07.234
There's
a lot that marty
doesn't remember.

37:07.301 --> 37:09.334
[Shop door bell
jingles,
door slams]

37:10.568 --> 37:12.434
He's just trying to put
the pieces together.

37:24.434 --> 37:29.134
Marty pulled me
off that bridge
a long time ago.

37:31.301 --> 37:33.434
He saved me
when i was
at rock bottom.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.067
After that, whenever
either one of us

37:36.134 --> 37:38.800
did anything bad
or needed
to be forgiven,

37:38.867 --> 37:41.568
we would go
to that bridge
and wait for the other.

37:43.234 --> 37:44.234
That's right.

37:45.401 --> 37:46.934
I remember.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.733
I thought that
he would be waiting
for me there that night.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.700
But i was too late.

37:56.767 --> 37:58.967
I found the bottle,
and i knew

37:59.034 --> 38:00.900
that he had done
something bad to himself

38:00.967 --> 38:02.800
and he did it
off that bridge

38:02.867 --> 38:04.700
so that
i would forgive him.
[Laughs]

38:04.767 --> 38:07.167
He's sorry.
He really is.

38:07.234 --> 38:09.267
He just thought that you
would be better off
without him.

38:09.334 --> 38:11.767
Oh, well, you
were wrong, marty!

38:11.833 --> 38:13.201
I loved you!

38:13.267 --> 38:15.501
It wasn't exactly
the healthiest love
in the world,

38:15.568 --> 38:18.201
but... we could've
made it work.

38:18.267 --> 38:20.700
He knows that he made
a mistake.

38:20.767 --> 38:22.867
And he doesn't want you
to suffer for it anymore.

38:22.934 --> 38:26.267
Easier said than done.
Suffering is
my bread and butter.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.800
Tell her... that it's
the only way i can
redeem myself

38:30.867 --> 38:32.867
for what i did...

38:32.934 --> 38:33.967
to go away

38:34.034 --> 38:36.733
knowing that...
she's gonna be ok.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.134
He wants
to redeem himself.

38:39.201 --> 38:41.134
He wants to know
that you're gonna be ok.

38:44.000 --> 38:44.934
Tell her that i

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
love her.

38:47.401 --> 38:49.167
I always did...

38:49.234 --> 38:50.568
always will.

38:50.634 --> 38:52.334
He loves you.

38:53.900 --> 38:56.501
[Tearfully]
Why did you
do it, marty?

38:56.568 --> 39:00.568
I love you, too,
so much. Why
did you leave me?

39:01.733 --> 39:02.733
It's ok.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.800
You're gonna be ok.
I promise.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.100
Ohhh...

39:13.767 --> 39:16.434
what if i get happy
and i'm not funny
anymore?

39:18.867 --> 39:21.201
He doesn't think that
that's gonna be an issue.

39:35.401 --> 39:37.967
[Whispering]
I'll be watching you
tonight, baby.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.668
L... i live
in grandview,

39:47.733 --> 39:49.668
which, as you guys
know, is the dating

39:49.733 --> 39:51.501
capital
of the northeast.

39:52.568 --> 39:54.733
And, um...
it's hard, you know?

39:54.800 --> 39:56.000
'Cause i'm
a single woman.

39:56.067 --> 39:57.334
I'm 6 feet tall.
I'm livin' alone

39:57.401 --> 39:59.733
in a small town.
It's kinda scary,
you know?

39:59.800 --> 40:01.568
And i'm watchin' tv
the other night
and i'm home alone,

40:01.634 --> 40:04.800
and a... a guy escaped
from a local jail.

40:04.867 --> 40:06.867
And i'm there
in the dark,

40:06.934 --> 40:09.568
and all i can think is
"oh, my god...

40:09.634 --> 40:11.401
i hope he's tall."

40:12.467 --> 40:14.501
You guys
have been awesome!

40:14.568 --> 40:16.201
Thank you so much!

40:16.267 --> 40:18.467
Thank you!

40:20.934 --> 40:22.434
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:22.501 --> 40:24.568
the moment you've all
been waiting for...

40:24.634 --> 40:27.067
the incomparable,
the peerless

40:27.134 --> 40:29.167
sandra holloway!
Give it up!

40:39.833 --> 40:41.100
Andrea: Give it up!

41:02.134 --> 41:03.700
Sandra: So, i was up
late last night,

41:03.767 --> 41:06.201
doing something
that i don't normally do

41:06.267 --> 41:07.301
when i'm alone.

41:07.367 --> 41:09.534
Ooh...
ooh...
whoo!

41:09.601 --> 41:10.534
[Laughter]

41:10.601 --> 41:11.534
I said something

41:11.601 --> 41:13.267
i don't <i>normally</i> do

41:13.334 --> 41:15.301
[laughter]
When i'm alone.

41:15.367 --> 41:18.900
I was talking
to an old friend of mine
from the past.

41:18.967 --> 41:22.201
He's been dead
for 2 years.

41:22.267 --> 41:24.700
Keeps tryin' to get me
to come visit.
Some friend, right?

41:28.167 --> 41:31.267
And i says to him,
"hey... you're dead.

41:31.334 --> 41:33.167
"So come on,
tell me something

41:33.234 --> 41:35.501
"really deep
and profound.

41:35.568 --> 41:38.100
Enlighten me."
Right?

41:38.167 --> 41:40.467
"Give me something
that will help me

41:40.534 --> 41:42.900
to better my life
here on earth."

41:42.967 --> 41:44.900
And he looks at me...

41:44.967 --> 41:47.000
takes a deep breath...

41:47.067 --> 41:48.967
and he says...

41:49.034 --> 41:51.067
"honey...

41:51.134 --> 41:54.267
those jeans really do
make you look fat."

41:56.367 --> 41:57.867
Good night, grandview.

42:00.733 --> 42:02.568
You've been
a great audience!

42:02.634 --> 42:04.000
Thank you!

42:54.034 --> 42:55.700
So, can you tell me
what it's like?

42:55.767 --> 42:58.700
I don't know.
I'm still alive.

42:58.767 --> 43:00.367
Everybody's
a comedian.

43:00.434 --> 43:01.767
No, really.
What do you hear?

43:01.833 --> 43:04.568
I don't know.
No one's ever come
back to complain.

43:04.634 --> 43:06.267
Let's...
leave it at that.

43:10.967 --> 43:12.267
Thank you.

43:12.334 --> 43:14.401
You're welcome.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.467
Thank <i>you.</i>

43:17.134 --> 43:18.967
For the laughs.

43:25.134 --> 43:26.167
Hmm.

43:26.234 --> 43:27.234
What?

43:29.800 --> 43:31.000
Dying is easy.

43:31.067 --> 43:33.900
It's the comedy
that's hard.
