WEBVTT

01:15.325 --> 01:17.910
- Can we film?
- Whenever you're ready, doctor.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.955
We're in the Chamfors industrial zone.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.626
It was on this very spot
that the child was found.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.421
This is Building 1.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.467
We have authorization
to make this film

01:33.593 --> 01:38.430
for the medical archives of Assumption
Hospital Pediatric Services.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.436
Here we are.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.648
This is where she lived.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.986
She wasn't raped.
That much is certain.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.573
Otherwise it's a classic case
of child abuse.

01:56.699 --> 02:01.286
Malnutrition, dehydration,
mild hypothermia.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.624
The hole allowed her
to relieve herself.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.127
The wrist infection indicates
she was tied down.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.214
But how did she get out?

02:12.340 --> 02:14.633
Lucie won't say what she endured.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.438
- Is that orange juice?
- Yes.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.690
- Is it for her?
- Yes.

03:12.233 --> 03:16.028
- You're a regular little mummy.
- She has no one now.

04:04.369 --> 04:08.538
Don't worry, Anna.
These gentlemen are very nice.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.207
OK.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.127
You understand why
we showed you this film?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.714
Why do you think we need you?

04:18.257 --> 04:24.513
Because you want
to catch the people who hurt Lucie?

04:25.306 --> 04:26.807
That's right, Anna.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.060
Lucie, too.
She says you have to catch them.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.648
- What else did she say...?
- She's scared.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.818
- She tells you things?
- She's scared.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.736
What does she remember?

04:39.862 --> 04:43.615
She doesn't know who it was.
Sometimes she thinks she remembers,

04:43.741 --> 04:45.701
sometimes she doesn't.

04:46.786 --> 04:51.039
And what do you think?
Can she remember?

04:51.165 --> 04:54.418
It was always dark.
She couldn't see much.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.295
She doesn't remember.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.631
Come in.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.887
Lucie Jurin didn't come to lunch.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.921
Anna...

05:44.552 --> 05:45.844
Don't tell anybody.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.350
- Don't do that.
- It wasn't me.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.018
It wasn't me.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.856
Calm down.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.374
Want to get in with me?

08:20.208 --> 08:23.960
15 YEARS LATER

08:50.571 --> 08:52.072
Give me that!

08:55.701 --> 08:58.078
That's enough, you two!

08:58.996 --> 09:00.413
Pain in the ass!

09:02.041 --> 09:04.251
His darling can't write!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.420
Stop it, I said.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.755
You rotten sister!

09:16.597 --> 09:18.848
You having breakfast or not?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.016
We're coming.

09:23.729 --> 09:28.024
MARIE BELFOND REGIONAL 100m
BUTTERFLY STROKE CHAMPION

09:45.293 --> 09:46.876
That's how you talk about it?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.587
How should I talk?

09:48.713 --> 09:51.840
Smartass! And you wait until Sunday.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.258
Told your mother?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.721
- What does she say?
- That there's a water pressure problem.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.974
When she goes all DIY,
she's not happy.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.851
- And you're happy?
- Me?

10:02.977 --> 10:05.061
This is the high life.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.273
- Mission accomplished.
- Great.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.026
Here...

10:11.861 --> 10:13.403
A gift from the chief.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.115
- Oh shit, Gabrielle!
- It's gross.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.034
In the main pipe.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.786
It explains the low shower pressure.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.039
Dump it. We're eating.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.624
Mum!

10:27.209 --> 10:29.961
It’s sickening,
but we can put the garden back.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.717
- Did Antoine mention his great plans?
- I was just asking what you thought.

10:35.843 --> 10:40.305
- You were asking if she wasn't mad.
- Keep out of this.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.933
- But he's my brother.
- Your darling brother's a visionary.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.603
Right, Antoine?

10:46.729 --> 10:50.357
It'll be an expensive school
to leave after just 3 months.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.609
And with tuition paid in advance.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.696
- Do you mind?
- She made the headlines.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.115
- You going to make this a habit?
- What?

10:59.241 --> 11:02.494
You needed prep school
just to graduate.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.954
- You just scraped by.
- But I graduated.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.958
A good thing, too.
Remember what it cost?

11:09.752 --> 11:13.004
The checks each term?
But did you give a damn?

11:13.130 --> 11:16.424
Aren't you tired of being such a pain?

11:16.550 --> 11:19.010
But this school is different.

11:19.845 --> 11:23.640
- I want to study something I like now.
- Nobody forced you.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.143
But law isn't my thing.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.230
- Law opens every door.
- That's not the problem.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.107
He wants to live with his sweetheart.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.650
But law's not my thing.

11:34.443 --> 11:37.278
If anything was your thing, we'd know.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.532
You wanted to drop out
to be a pastry cook, you dummy!

11:41.909 --> 11:43.410
That's below the belt!

11:46.122 --> 11:47.372
Who's the pain in the ass?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.208
Language, Marie Belfond!

11:50.334 --> 11:52.544
- It’s Sunday, after all.
- So?

11:52.670 --> 11:56.506
What are you resting up from?
A hard week at the factory?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.742
Don't move!

12:25.995 --> 12:27.245
Sit down.

12:36.714 --> 12:39.966
- How old are you?
- 18.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.096
Know what your parents did?

14:21.777 --> 14:23.653
How could you do that to me?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.409
How could you?

14:38.377 --> 14:40.044
Why?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.212
It's them.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.507
- It's them, Anna.
- You saw them?

15:26.634 --> 15:27.967
They've changed. But it's them.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.636
- You sure?
- I'm telling you.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.429
- It’s been 15 years.
- It's them.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.640
- You can tell from a newspaper photo?
- Yes!

15:34.350 --> 15:35.892
- Let's call the cops.
- No need.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.727
- What?
- I did what I had to.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.687
- What?
- What I had to.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.982
- You had to observe. You weren't sure.
- But I am sure.

15:43.108 --> 15:47.028
- I knew I should've come along.
- Why don't you believe me?

15:49.865 --> 15:53.159
- Where you calling from?
- The house.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.453
- Their house?
- Yes.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.538
Give me the address.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.292
Give me the address!

18:11.256 --> 18:12.799
l did it.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.233
Look.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.069
I did it.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.772
It’s me, Lucie. Calm down.
It’s me.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.774
She's here.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.367
- She's in the house.
- I know.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.996
She hurt me even worse.
Look!

22:29.556 --> 22:32.183
- Stay here.
- Where you going?

22:32.809 --> 22:34.810
- To take a look.
- She's in there.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.937
- I have to look.
- She's in there.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.941
Look at me. I have to look.
Wait for me.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.603
- She hurt me worse than before.
- I'm coming.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.150
What will I do?

24:05.652 --> 24:07.069
I’m coming.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.906
- I’m out of cartridges.
- Do without them.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.325
- Why don't we leave?
- Come on.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.494
She'll be back.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.870
Come on.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.875
You phoned me from the house.
They'll know it's us.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.461
- I don't care.
- Right.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.798
- I don't care.
- If they lock you up, you'll care.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.266
- What will we do?
- Keep still.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.312
- It hurts.
- Sorry.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.817
What will we do, Anna?

26:12.862 --> 26:14.446
Are you OK?

26:20.328 --> 26:21.787
Does it make you sick?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.294
Can you smell it?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.837
That awful smell?

26:29.963 --> 26:32.548
I smelt it when she bent over me.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.092
Every day, understand?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.887
When she beat me, I'd smell it.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.398
Look.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.611
It’s them.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.853
What are you doing?

27:36.029 --> 27:37.571
Will I ever be free of this?

30:04.135 --> 30:06.887
Please, don't make any noise.

30:13.978 --> 30:14.978
What are you up to?

30:18.525 --> 30:19.983
You OK?

30:20.109 --> 30:22.110
- I called you.
- I was here.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.071
I thought she'd come back.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.489
You finished?

30:25.615 --> 30:27.407
- Then we'll go.
- After we clean up.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.785
- Then we'll go?
- Sure. Get dressed.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.147
- Open up, Anna.
- It’s locked.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.233
Open up.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.025
Hurry!

32:36.037 --> 32:37.663
What do you want?

32:38.247 --> 32:40.040
Leave me alone!

32:40.166 --> 32:41.541
I killed them.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.837
Even their kids.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.340
I even killed their kids.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.149
Calm down.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.808
Don't go in there, you little slut!

35:04.060 --> 35:05.727
I'll kill you!

35:32.588 --> 35:33.880
Forgive me.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.384
It’s not my fault.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.443
Where are you?

36:46.787 --> 36:49.206
l know you're in there. Open up.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.544
I’m coming.

37:10.519 --> 37:11.937
What's your name?

37:12.688 --> 37:13.730
Gabrielle.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.234
I’m coming, Lucie.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.402
Help me, Gabrielle.

37:19.528 --> 37:20.946
Why did she do this?

37:39.590 --> 37:41.299
I think she heard us.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.312
We have to hurry.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.328
- An ambulance.
- I can't.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.247
For my children.

38:15.042 --> 38:17.794
I’ll take you as far as the woods.
Then you're on your own.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.798
Don't!

38:25.428 --> 38:26.553
Don't, Lucie!

39:08.888 --> 39:10.764
Why did you help her?

39:11.766 --> 39:15.518
- She didn't do anything.
- She hurt me.

39:15.644 --> 39:17.145
Me!

39:22.777 --> 39:24.361
And you want her to live?

39:50.971 --> 39:54.516
- You never believed me.
- Stop it.

39:56.143 --> 39:59.270
You think I’m crazy,
just like the doctors.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.736
What did they ever do for me,
apart from think me crazy?

40:06.862 --> 40:09.239
And you're like them.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.247
It’s over, Anna.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.264
They're dead.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.183
They won't hurt you anymore.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.346
Stop!

45:36.859 --> 45:38.943
Why are you calling?

45:39.069 --> 45:42.613
Not a word from you in two years,
and now you call?

45:42.740 --> 45:43.823
Yes...

45:43.949 --> 45:46.367
I'm furious with you.
I won't hide it.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.994
Mum...

45:48.120 --> 45:50.997
- Trying to make me feel guilty?
- No.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.458
Think I don't blame myself?

45:53.584 --> 45:57.795
Think my head's not filled
with all the crap I did?

45:59.047 --> 46:02.842
- That's not it, Mum.
- Then what?

46:02.968 --> 46:05.678
I wanted to talk to you.
I just felt like it.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.015
So one morning you decide
you miss your mother?

46:09.683 --> 46:13.603
- So you're OK? Not in trouble?
- No.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.689
- You sure? Where are you?
- Pretty far away.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.778
Where you do sleep?
How do you live?

46:21.904 --> 46:23.154
I’m OK.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.782
You still with her?
You're under her influence?

46:25.908 --> 46:27.575
No!

46:27.701 --> 46:30.495
Christ! You're still with her.
It's the same thing.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.832
That girl's a good-for-nothing.

46:34.958 --> 46:40.171
She's a bitch, a pervert, a loser...
Get away from her.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.469
Don't move.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.692
I can't help you.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.100
Don't be afraid.

53:50.810 --> 53:52.478
Calm down.

55:18.565 --> 55:20.441
Calm down.

55:28.783 --> 55:30.367
Rest.

55:57.687 --> 55:59.563
Forgive me.

56:03.818 --> 56:05.569
Forgive me.

57:06.714 --> 57:08.215
Stop it!

58:11.696 --> 58:13.864
Who's the girl on the couch?

58:14.616 --> 58:15.782
Who?

58:18.328 --> 58:21.330
- Lucie who?
- Lucie Jurin.

58:21.789 --> 58:22.789
And you?

58:24.667 --> 58:26.168
And you?

58:26.294 --> 58:27.544
Anna Assaoui.

58:28.755 --> 58:32.758
- We've been calling for hours.
- The phone was off the hook.

58:32.884 --> 58:34.676
This shouldn't have happened.

58:34.802 --> 58:37.596
Can you tell me what went on here?

58:39.891 --> 58:41.892
What are you doing here?

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:18.006
Lucie Jurin escaped us 15 years ago,
didn't she?

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:21.176
Didn't she?

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:27.474
A time when we were, shall we say,
less organized.

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:32.270
Gabrielle shouldn't have let her
get away. The child found her.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:35.982
After 15 years,
that takes some doing.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.945
As for the rest,
Lucie is only a victim.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.155
Like all the others.

01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:47.577
It’s so easy to create a victim,
young lady, so easy.

01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:52.874
You lock someone in a dark room.
They begin to suffer.

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:57.129
You feed that suffering,
methodically,

01:01:57.255 --> 01:02:00.006
systematically and coldly.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:01.717
And make it last.

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:06.680
Your subject goes through
a number of states.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:13.311
After a while, their trauma,
that small, easily opened crack

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:17.524
makes them see things that don't exist.

01:02:18.317 --> 01:02:20.610
What did your poor Lucie see?

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:24.197
Nothing?

01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:27.951
Not even a monster or two?

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:30.579
Things that wanted to hurt her?

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.710
- A dead girl.
- There you are...

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:38.336
A dead girl.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.632
The girl you found, Sarah Dutreuil,
kept seeing cockroaches

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:45.469
running all over her.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.013
She'd have cut her arm off
rather than bear that.

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:51.683
People no longer envisage suffering,
young lady.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.020
That's how the world is.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.398
There are nothing but victims left.

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:02.819
Martyrs are very rare.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:06.740
A martyr is something else.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.201
Martyrs are extraordinary beings.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:12.662
They survive pain,
they survive total deprivation.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.791
They bear all the sins of the earth,

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:19.795
they give themselves up,
they transcend themselves.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.797
Do you understand that word?

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:24.257
They are transfigured.

01:03:28.387 --> 01:03:32.057
Long Sheng Province. 1912.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.267
This woman didn't believe in God.

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:37.479
She tried to steal a hen.
It cost her dearly.

01:03:37.605 --> 01:03:40.106
When this photo was taken,
she was still alive.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.650
Look at her eyes.

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:47.989
Jouans-Lussac. 1945.
This woman was a grocer.

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:50.617
She slept with a Kraut.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:53.036
At the time, the French
were touchy. She had to pay.

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:56.498
She was alive.
Look at her eyes.

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:01.795
Birmingham Hospital. 1960.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:06.591
An ordinary housewife, an atheist,
in the terminal stages of cancer.

01:04:06.717 --> 01:04:09.511
Morphine has no effect now.
Look at her eyes.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.890
Beaten by her husband
in a fit of jealous rage.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:16.226
Nine hours in a car wreck.

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:19.771
A young leukemia victim
in her final moments.

01:04:19.897 --> 01:04:21.940
Stricken with a rare disease.

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:26.069
Nine hours of agony.
Look at her eyes.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.322
All of them, young lady.
You hear me?

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:32.826
They were all alive when photographed.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:36.121
Don't try to tell me that
the notion of martyrdom

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.498
is an invention of the religious.

01:04:38.624 --> 01:04:40.750
We tried everything, even children.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:47.257
It turns out that women
are more responsive to transfiguration.

01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:51.595
Young women.

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:53.638
That's how it is, young lady.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.861
Anna?

01:19:43.987 --> 01:19:46.906
- Are you there?
- I'm here.

01:19:48.658 --> 01:19:50.534
Yes, Lucie?

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.622
- Why are you never scared?
- I am scared sometimes.

01:19:54.748 --> 01:19:58.375
- Not like me.
- I didn't go through what you did.

01:20:00.086 --> 01:20:04.632
- How do you stop being scared?
- Let yourself go, I think.

01:20:05.425 --> 01:20:08.177
- You think so?
- Let yourself go.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.431
And if I can't, will you be there?

01:20:13.683 --> 01:20:15.309
I miss you.

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:52.573
You're not scared now.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.332
You're not scared now.

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.796
Not scared now.

01:22:39.579 --> 01:22:41.497
You'll be all right, Anna.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.377
Your suffering is almost over.

01:22:48.505 --> 01:22:51.090
There's one more stage.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:53.384
The last one.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:57.471
You'll be all right. You won't have
to protect yourself ever again.

01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.431
It’s OK, Anna.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.213
- She still bearing up?
- Amazing.

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:37.334
- Michel!
- What is it?

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:49.012
Just now. I went down to feed her.

01:27:49.138 --> 01:27:51.598
- Are you sure?
- It’s like I said.

01:27:51.724 --> 01:27:54.351
I've never seen an expression like it.

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:58.313
She's let go, completely let go.
Her face is like...

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:03.735
Mademoiselle... her eyes... I swear,
she no longer sees anything around her.

01:28:03.861 --> 01:28:07.656
- But is she still...
- She's alive, Mademoiselle.

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:04.749
Did you see?

01:31:08.337 --> 01:31:10.505
The other world?

01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:45.350
Yesterday afternoon,
in this very house,

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:51.022
at around 12:15 pm,
Anna Assaoui was martyred.

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:55.860
Let us pay our respects.

01:32:56.487 --> 01:32:59.072
Anna Assaoui is an exceptional being.

01:32:59.198 --> 01:33:01.533
In 17 years of endeavors,

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:04.953
she is only the fourth
to have attained that stage.

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:07.414
And the first, yes, my friends,

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.126
the first to have related
what she has seen.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.547
Between 12:15 and 2:30 pm,

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:19.217
Miss Assaoui clearly saw
what lay beyond death.

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:24.889
You heard me, her state of ecstasy
lasted two hours and 15 minutes.

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:28.310
This was not
a near-death experience.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:31.146
She experienced authentic martyrdom.

01:33:31.272 --> 01:33:33.857
At 2:30pm,
she came out of this state.

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:37.527
At 3:05pm, she spoke.

01:33:37.653 --> 01:33:40.822
At this very moment,
she is still alive.

01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.949
But she has stopped communicating.

01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:46.411
Mademoiselle heard her testimony.

01:33:46.537 --> 01:33:51.875
That testimony, dear friends,
will be shared with you in a moment.

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:06.139
Mademoiselle,
they're all waiting.

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:09.559
I’m coming, Etienne.

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.775
So there is something.

01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:19.027
Of course.

01:34:20.237 --> 01:34:21.780
Was it clear?

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.575
Crystal clear.

01:34:26.952 --> 01:34:28.536
And precise?

01:34:30.456 --> 01:34:33.917
It admitted of no interpretations,
Etienne.

01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:38.630
Thank you, Mademoiselle.

01:34:52.144 --> 01:34:55.313
Could you imagine
what there is after death?

01:34:56.232 --> 01:34:57.691
Are you all right?

01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:02.487
- Could you?
- No, Mademoiselle...

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:06.241
Keep doubting.

01:35:17.002 --> 01:35:22.215
Martyr: n.
from the Greek "martus":

01:35:22.341 --> 01:35:25.885
Witness
