&lrm;It's no good! The brakes are busted!

00:36.680 --> 00:38.720
&lrm;-Ready, Cat Noir?
&lrm;-I'm always ready.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.000
&lrm;Who needs brakes when they've got us?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.240
&lrm;[gurgles]

01:00.080 --> 01:03.280
&lrm;So, er, Ladybug, what would you say
&lrm;if you and I met up tonight

01:03.400 --> 01:05.480
&lrm;for a little dinner, rooftop-style?

01:05.600 --> 01:10.040
&lrm;-For dinner? As superheroes?
&lrm;-Well, uh... yeah! That's right!

01:10.160 --> 01:12.400
&lrm;We're only together
&lrm;when we're saving Paris.

01:12.520 --> 01:17.000
&lrm;-Shouldn't we get to know one another?
&lrm;-I... That's so thoughtful. But I can't.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.960
&lrm;I have to... I've already
&lrm;got plans with some friends!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.360
&lrm;Thank you. Thank you, Ladybug.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.000
&lrm;Well, if your plans end early,
&lrm;come and join me!

01:25.120 --> 01:27.200
&lrm;-We'll see!
&lrm;-I'll be waiting, Milady!

01:31.200 --> 01:34.680
&lrm;-It was delicious, sweetheart!
&lrm;-And, as a dessert...

01:34.880 --> 01:36.560
&lrm;Ta-dah!

01:36.680 --> 01:39.320
&lrm;Wow! Oh! No, thanks, Dad.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.200
&lrm;-But isn't this your favourite?
&lrm;-And it still is, Dad! But...

01:44.320 --> 01:47.360
&lrm;I told you I was going
&lrm;to get ice cream at André's.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.560
&lrm;[both]
&lrm;Oh! Sweethearts ice cream!

01:49.680 --> 01:52.840
&lrm;-That was where your father asked me...
&lrm;-To marry him.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.200
&lrm;He hid the ring
&lrm;in a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

01:55.320 --> 01:57.320
&lrm;And you almost swallowed it, too!

01:57.440 --> 02:01.320
&lrm;They say that couples who eat ice cream
&lrm;at André's will stay in love forever.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.160
&lrm;By the way,
&lrm;who are you getting ice cream with?

02:04.280 --> 02:07.240
&lrm;Oops! Gotta go! Don't wanna be late!
&lrm;See you later, guys!

02:07.360 --> 02:08.560
&lrm;[both]
&lrm;Oh...

02:10.960 --> 02:13.200
&lrm;[sighs]

02:20.480 --> 02:22.760
&lrm;There's no point
&lrm;in waiting for your father.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.000
&lrm;He'll be eating in his office.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.920
&lrm;What's the point of keeping me here
&lrm;if he's never going to show up?

02:30.040 --> 02:32.640
&lrm;Don't forget to practise your piano
&lrm;before bed.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.320
&lrm;You could've at least grabbed
&lrm;that piece of &lrm;<i>camembert</i>&lrm;!

02:38.440 --> 02:43.280
&lrm;Fuel up, Plagg! Adrien may not be allowed
&lrm;out of the house, but Cat Noir is!

02:43.400 --> 02:46.720
&lrm;-You seem in a hurry to get stood up.
&lrm;-She didn't say she wasn't coming.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.200
&lrm;But she didn't say she was, either.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.520
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

02:51.640 --> 02:53.680
&lrm;Don't I even get a minute
&lrm;to digest my food?

03:13.520 --> 03:16.000
&lrm;-Hey, Alya!
&lrm;-Hey, Marinette!

03:19.200 --> 03:21.480
&lrm;-Where's Adrien?
&lrm;-Don't get upset, OK,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.080
&lrm;but Nino just got a text.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.480
&lrm;Adrien's dad isn't letting him go out.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.400
&lrm;-Once again.
&lrm;-Yo, Marinette!

03:29.520 --> 03:31.600
&lrm;-What's up, M?
&lrm;-How are you, Marinette?

03:31.720 --> 03:35.520
&lrm;I'm fine, thanks.
&lrm;So, do you know where André is today?

03:35.640 --> 03:38.720
&lrm;The deal with André is that
&lrm;you never know where he's gonna be.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.040
&lrm;You gotta follow his clues
&lrm;to find out.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.800
&lrm;The first time Mylène and I
&lrm;wanted André's ice cream,

03:43.920 --> 03:47.520
&lrm;it took us three hours to find his cart!
&lrm;Do you remember?

03:48.880 --> 03:50.680
&lrm;Hey! Someone posted a photo!

03:50.800 --> 03:53.680
&lrm;-He's on his way to the Pont des Arts!
&lrm;-Let's go!

03:53.800 --> 03:55.920
&lrm;-Come on, Marinette!
&lrm;-Yeah! Awesome!

&lrm;Strapping young Ivan
&lrm;and dear, sweet Mylène!

&lrm;to keep your love true!

05:01.720 --> 05:05.200
&lrm;Ah, these two I've never seen!
&lrm;This your first time here with me?

05:05.680 --> 05:07.080
&lrm;[both laugh]
&lrm;Yeah!

05:07.440 --> 05:08.480
&lrm;Coconut, banana,

05:08.600 --> 05:11.680
&lrm;-and a touch passionfruit!
&lrm;-Why don't you go and get one too?

05:12.320 --> 05:15.080
&lrm;What's the point? Adrien won't be coming.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.880
&lrm;He might not be here, but that shouldn't
&lrm;stop you from enjoying an ice cream

05:19.000 --> 05:22.680
&lrm;and a fun night with your friends.
&lrm;And you could give me a taste, too!

05:23.280 --> 05:26.240
&lrm;And how about this young Miss,
&lrm;the pretty one who sighs?

05:26.360 --> 05:30.320
&lrm;I've a flavour just for her.
&lrm;It's sure to make her smile.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.600
&lrm;-Me?
&lrm;-What's your name, dear?

05:32.720 --> 05:34.200
&lrm;Marinette.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.880
&lrm;Peach pink like his lips
&lrm;and mint like his eyes.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.080
&lrm;Eat this, my dear,
&lrm;and your love will materialise!

05:42.640 --> 05:46.080
&lrm;No! There's been a mistake.
&lrm;I'm not in love with anyone

05:46.200 --> 05:47.920
&lrm;and I think I've just lost my appetite.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.640
&lrm;But of course you are!

05:49.760 --> 05:53.560
&lrm;When there's love burning in one's heart,
&lrm;André knows it from the start!

05:53.680 --> 05:56.880
&lrm;Enjoy your ice cream, Marinette.
&lrm;I know he will be here.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.320
&lrm;Green eyes, like mint!
&lrm;Now who could that be?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.520
&lrm;Thank you. But you've got it all wrong.
&lrm;I don't have a...

06:07.640 --> 06:09.360
&lrm;[whistling]

06:14.480 --> 06:15.440
&lrm;Adrien?

06:19.120 --> 06:21.800
&lrm;Hey, you finally made it. That's great!

06:21.920 --> 06:25.200
&lrm;[gasps] André's ice cream
&lrm;has always melted hearts!

06:25.320 --> 06:28.520
&lrm;But the magic will only work
&lrm;if you eat it! I'll make another one.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.040
&lrm;-Thanks, but it's really not necessary.
&lrm;-Yes, it is, my dear!

06:33.160 --> 06:36.000
&lrm;See here? My ice cream
&lrm;has brought everyone together!

06:36.120 --> 06:39.520
&lrm;Every famous loving couple in Paris!
&lrm;Edith and Marcel,

06:39.640 --> 06:44.840
&lrm;Jeanne and Serge, Olive and Tom!
&lrm;Your loved one is out there! Somewhere!

06:44.960 --> 06:48.480
&lrm;All you need is to believe in the magic
&lrm;of André's ice cream!

06:49.080 --> 06:52.720
&lrm;You're very nice, André.
&lrm;But I don't have a loved one.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.720
&lrm;Who has green eyes?
&lrm;Do you think we know him?

06:55.840 --> 06:58.520
&lrm;Lay off, Ivan. There's no one, OK?

06:59.120 --> 07:02.400
&lrm;And I don't think there's something
&lrm;magical about your ice cream.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.120
&lrm;It's just... ice cream!

07:10.880 --> 07:12.960
&lrm;Hey! I was going to get another one!

07:13.560 --> 07:17.280
&lrm;But André's ice cream
&lrm;always melts people's hearts!

07:17.720 --> 07:20.360
&lrm;At least, it used to.
&lrm;[sobs]

07:21.960 --> 07:26.800
&lrm;A thwarted artisan, his shattered dreams,
&lrm;and the collapse of his whole world.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.600
&lrm;Quite chilling.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.880
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma, and freeze
&lrm;the heart of this ice-cream maker!

07:50.280 --> 07:53.560
&lrm;I don't understand.
&lrm;It's never failed... ever!

07:55.640 --> 08:00.960
&lrm;Glaciator, I am Hawk Moth.
&lrm;Revenge is a dish best served cold.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.520
&lrm;Since they refused
&lrm;to let you melt their hearts,

08:03.640 --> 08:07.480
&lrm;I'm giving you the power to melt
&lrm;their entire bodies instead.

08:07.600 --> 08:13.440
&lrm;I only ask a little favour in return.
&lrm;Get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

08:13.560 --> 08:15.880
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir-flavoured ice cream?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.040
&lrm;It's a deal, Hawk Moth.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.880
&lrm;I'll get even give a double scoop!

08:28.040 --> 08:30.640
&lrm;[screaming]

08:30.760 --> 08:33.960
&lrm;Hello! How about some ice cream?
&lrm;Will that do?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.480
&lrm;Enjoy it. It's just for you!

08:40.440 --> 08:42.360
&lrm;[evil laugh]

08:52.000 --> 08:53.760
&lrm;Marinette!

08:56.560 --> 09:00.280
&lrm;What a disaster! I ruined
&lrm;the whole night for all of my friends.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.960
&lrm;And I was mean to André. I'm so lame!

09:04.440 --> 09:07.040
&lrm;You're not lame.
&lrm;You just overreacted a little.

09:07.160 --> 09:10.440
&lrm;Just let it go.
&lrm;Tomorrow will be a new day.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.840
&lrm;I'll never get to eat
&lrm;ice cream with Adrien!

09:32.400 --> 09:35.720
&lrm;She loves me, she loves me not.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.400
&lrm;She loves me,

09:39.440 --> 09:40.600
&lrm;she loves me...

09:55.360 --> 09:57.760
&lrm;-Hello.
&lrm;-Cat Noir?

09:57.880 --> 10:01.200
&lrm;Sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you.

10:01.320 --> 10:05.240
&lrm;What are you doing here? Don't you have,
&lrm;like, "superhero-y things" to do?

10:05.360 --> 10:08.840
&lrm;No. I don't feel like
&lrm;being a superhero tonight.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.400
&lrm;And I also don't feel like
&lrm;being alone tonight.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.120
&lrm;Would you mind if I hung out here
&lrm;for a little while?

10:17.480 --> 10:20.320
&lrm;Marinette, right?
&lrm;We've bumped into each other before.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.600
&lrm;Yeah, a bunch of times.
&lrm;I mean, yes, we have.

10:23.720 --> 10:28.240
&lrm;One time, a supervillain fell in love
&lrm;with me! Talk about bad luck!

10:28.360 --> 10:33.000
&lrm;Seriously, I seem to be having some
&lrm;bad luck in the love department myself.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.560
&lrm;Really? What kind?

10:35.680 --> 10:40.960
&lrm;Well, tonight I had this special surprise
&lrm;all planned for Ladybug.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.440
&lrm;You're in love with Ladybug?

10:44.640 --> 10:45.760
&lrm;For real?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.760
&lrm;So, what was this special surprise?

11:00.520 --> 11:02.360
&lrm;[sighs] It doesn't really matter,

11:02.480 --> 11:04.360
&lrm;'cause she never showed.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.880
&lrm;Sounds like you and I both need
&lrm;a bit of cheering up tonight.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.040
&lrm;You...
&lrm;You've gotten your heart broken too?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.200
&lrm;Yep.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.000
&lrm;Hey, come with me.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.440
&lrm;Close your eyes and hold on tight, OK?

11:31.720 --> 11:33.280
&lrm;Just give me a minute.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.480
&lrm;All right, you can open your eyes now.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.520
&lrm;Wow!

11:41.640 --> 11:43.480
&lrm;Cat Noir... this is...

11:44.120 --> 11:45.040
&lrm;beautiful!

11:49.840 --> 11:51.600
&lrm;I'm so sorry.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.600
&lrm;-Why? It's not your fault.
&lrm;-No. Yeah.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.200
&lrm;I mean, what I mean is,
&lrm;I'm very sorry for you

11:58.320 --> 12:02.520
&lrm;'cause, um, you prepared all this
&lrm;and then...&lrm;<i> she</i>&lrm; didn't show!

12:02.640 --> 12:06.880
&lrm;She told me she might not make it,
&lrm;but I really wanted her to come.

12:10.120 --> 12:15.280
&lrm;Maybe she had a really good reason for not
&lrm;coming, like... a problem or something.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.720
&lrm;You're only saying that
&lrm;to make me feel better.

12:18.440 --> 12:21.400
&lrm;Yeah. I mean, no. I mean ... Look out!

12:23.640 --> 12:26.960
&lrm;Marinette, party-pooper,
&lrm;you're looking so sad and surly!

12:27.080 --> 12:30.280
&lrm;But Glaciator will make it all better,
&lrm;don't you worry!

12:30.400 --> 12:33.000
&lrm;What's that?
&lrm;Another supervillain in love with you?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.440
&lrm;No! That's... André the ice-cream maker!

12:36.560 --> 12:39.320
&lrm;The sweethearts guy?
&lrm;He isn't looking too sweet now.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.520

12:57.000 --> 12:59.760
&lrm;Go inside, Marinette!
&lrm;I'll lead him away from you!

12:59.880 --> 13:00.960
&lrm;Cat Noir!

13:01.800 --> 13:03.240
&lrm;Thanks for cheering me up!

13:03.360 --> 13:05.160
&lrm;It was the least I could do.

13:08.240 --> 13:12.560
&lrm;Wow! I've never seen this sensitive side
&lrm;of Cat Noir before!

13:12.680 --> 13:15.600
&lrm;Yeah, maybe I was wrong about him.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.960
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

13:20.080 --> 13:21.000
&lrm;Ha!

13:43.040 --> 13:45.880
&lrm;-Hey! Snow-dude! You looking for me?
&lrm;-Bad kitty!

13:46.000 --> 13:47.840
&lrm;Where have you hidden Marinette?

13:56.880 --> 13:58.800
&lrm;Hi!
&lrm;Did the bad guys leave you cold?

13:58.920 --> 14:02.520
&lrm;How was your amazing evening
&lrm;with your "friends"?

14:02.640 --> 14:05.600
&lrm;I've never tasted "superhero"
&lrm;flavour before!

14:05.720 --> 14:08.040
&lrm;I can't wait to serve myself
&lrm;a double scoop!

14:12.200 --> 14:13.480
&lrm;[screaming]

14:13.600 --> 14:15.480
&lrm;Don't forget what you promised me.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.080
&lrm;Get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!

14:18.200 --> 14:20.520
&lrm;I'm a man of my word, Hawk Moth.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.960
&lrm;Come out now or I'll bury Paris
&lrm;in an entire layer of ice cream!

14:25.080 --> 14:26.760
&lrm;The ice cream fires out of his hand.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.440
&lrm;And before André got akumatized,
&lrm;he served his ice creams using a...

14:30.560 --> 14:33.880
&lrm;-A whatchamacallit!
&lrm;-That's called an ice-cream scooper.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.880
&lrm;-That must be where the akuma's located!
&lrm;-It's been a ball!

14:37.000 --> 14:41.360
&lrm;But now it's time to turn you
&lrm;into popsicles, once and for all!

14:42.080 --> 14:43.160
&lrm;[gasp]

14:46.160 --> 14:48.880
&lrm;That's weird!
&lrm;He's leaving the couples alone.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.840
&lrm;-Too bad for us!
&lrm;-You don't understand!

14:51.960 --> 14:54.720
&lrm;He doesn't attack couples,
&lrm;so we could pretend...

14:55.480 --> 14:56.440
&lrm;Pretend?

14:56.680 --> 14:58.120
&lrm;To be in love.

14:58.240 --> 15:01.200
&lrm;Sorry. It's not cool
&lrm;to play with people's feelings.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.080
&lrm;Are you mad
&lrm;because I didn't show up?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.840
&lrm;-What do you think?
&lrm;-I didn't mean to hurt you.

15:22.480 --> 15:26.000
&lrm;-And I also had a surprise for you, too.
&lrm;-I really am sorry.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.240
&lrm;No, I'm the one who's sorry.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.280
&lrm;-Maybe another time.
&lrm;-Show yourselves, cowards!

15:33.400 --> 15:35.040
&lrm;-Let's try your idea.
&lrm;-Perfect.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.760
&lrm;[Glaciator] I know you're here!

15:47.880 --> 15:51.440
&lrm;Glaciator, fire!
&lrm;Now's the time! Freeze them forever!

15:53.320 --> 15:55.880
&lrm;-Hey!
&lrm;-It's all part of the plan.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.440
&lrm;I can't, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;They look so... in love!

16:00.560 --> 16:01.520
&lrm;Now! Ha!

16:03.360 --> 16:07.880
&lrm;I hit something inside!
&lrm;André's inside the monster!

16:08.000 --> 16:09.680
&lrm;-[shouts]
&lrm;-Look out!

16:10.760 --> 16:11.600
&lrm;[moaning]

16:12.560 --> 16:14.760
&lrm;This isn't over!

16:14.880 --> 16:17.200
&lrm;-What should we do?
&lrm;-We must take care of him

16:17.320 --> 16:19.840
&lrm;before all these people totally melt away!

16:20.440 --> 16:22.160
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:27.720 --> 16:29.960
&lrm;Looks like someone's going for a ride.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.000
&lrm;Grab three signposts
&lrm;and tie them to your stick.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.640
&lrm;-We're going to make a propeller!
&lrm;-A propeller?

16:46.720 --> 16:51.360
&lrm;<i>♪ A popsicle freeze is coming your way</i>
&lrm;<i>If you don't pass my test ♪</i>

16:51.480 --> 16:55.720
&lrm;-All right, now, give me your belt!
&lrm;<i>-♪ I'm Glaciator, you can't run from me ♪</i>

16:55.840 --> 16:58.760
&lrm;<i>♪ Hand over your Miraculous ♪</i>

17:08.359 --> 17:09.200
&lrm;Ready, Kitty?

17:10.440 --> 17:12.400
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:21.520 --> 17:22.480
&lrm;Faster!

17:38.080 --> 17:40.320
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

17:44.320 --> 17:46.360
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

17:49.800 --> 17:50.640
&lrm;Gotcha!

17:52.120 --> 17:53.800
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.280
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:03.640 --> 18:04.480
&lrm;Pound it!

18:04.600 --> 18:06.760
&lrm;<i>Sacrebleu</i>&lrm;! How enchanting!

18:06.880 --> 18:10.000
&lrm;Saved from the cold
&lrm;by a couple of super-lovebirds!

18:11.120 --> 18:12.360
&lrm;He said it!

18:13.720 --> 18:18.720
&lrm;Ladybug! You've melted all my plans!
&lrm;But someday, I will triumph.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.360
&lrm;And it will taste of such sweet revenge!

18:27.760 --> 18:31.800
&lrm;-It's beautiful, Cat Noir.
&lrm;-Aren't you glad you finally came?

18:31.920 --> 18:35.440
&lrm;Listen, I don't want to play around
&lrm;with your feelings.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.800
&lrm;It would be the same as lying to you
&lrm;and I don't want to do that.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.280
&lrm;You're more than a partner, Cat Noir.
&lrm;You're my friend.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.600
&lrm;And I'd never want to lie to a friend.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.360
&lrm;But why do you think it'd be lying?

18:47.480 --> 18:49.840
&lrm;Because there's this boy I...

18:50.600 --> 18:52.600
&lrm;There's a boy? Who is... ?

18:53.320 --> 18:54.560
&lrm;It's...

18:55.480 --> 18:59.160
&lrm;I can't tell you who it is.
&lrm;We can't know anything about each other.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.800
&lrm;Our identities must remain a secret.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.040
&lrm;We're both superheroes, Cat Noir.
&lrm;We don't have a choice.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.200
&lrm;I get it, Ladybug.
&lrm;Your friendship means everything to me.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.280
&lrm;You can keep the rose.
&lrm;It goes with your costume!

19:30.800 --> 19:34.760
&lrm;The only way to get over a heartache is
&lrm;to eat a whole bunch of cheese. Shall we?

19:34.880 --> 19:36.400
&lrm;I don't have a heartache, Plagg.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.280
&lrm;Great! So, then, no cheese fest?

19:39.400 --> 19:43.400
&lrm;Perhaps Ladybug will love me some day.
&lrm;I mean, like I love her.

19:43.800 --> 19:48.280
&lrm;I have to believe. In the meantime,
&lrm;her friendship is the best gift of all.

19:48.880 --> 19:54.000
&lrm;Ugh! All this sweet talk
&lrm;is grossing me out! I need &lrm;<i>camembert</i>&lrm;!

20:01.280 --> 20:03.520
&lrm;-Hello, André!
&lrm;-Hey, pretty Marinette!

20:03.640 --> 20:06.360
&lrm;Can I offer you some ice cream,
&lrm;to eat, this time?

20:06.480 --> 20:09.880
&lrm;Of course! How else will I know
&lrm;if it's really the best in Paris?

20:10.280 --> 20:13.040
&lrm;Peach pink like his lips
&lrm;and mint like his eyes.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.560
&lrm;It's delicious!

20:16.680 --> 20:18.920
&lrm;Still think
&lrm;it doesn't lock loves together?

20:19.040 --> 20:22.320
&lrm;Never say never! Have a good day, André.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.600
&lrm;See you again soon, my dear.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.320
&lrm;Mmm!
&lrm;[laughs]

20:31.440 --> 20:35.640
&lrm;Another customer! Welcome!
&lrm;Would you like some sweetheart ice cream?

20:35.760 --> 20:39.080
&lrm;-Is your ice cream really magical?
&lrm;-What do you think?

20:39.200 --> 20:42.040
&lrm;-I think you have to believe.
&lrm;-You're spot on, son!

20:42.640 --> 20:46.120
&lrm;Strawberry with black chocolate chip,
&lrm;blackberries for her hair,

20:46.240 --> 20:49.040
&lrm;blueberry ice cream,
&lrm;just like her sky-blue stare.

20:49.960 --> 20:50.960
&lrm;On the house!

20:52.760 --> 20:56.120
&lrm;There's love in your eyes.
&lrm;André can see it, clear as day!

20:56.240 --> 20:59.400
&lrm;-This love is true!
&lrm;-Have a good day.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.600
&lrm;[lively music]
