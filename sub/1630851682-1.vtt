WEBVTT

00:28.595 --> 00:30.764
ABOUT THE DEADLY DRONE STRIKE.
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I WENT THE

00:30.764 --> 00:35.468
ENTIRE SUMMER WITHOUT FALLING
DOWN THE STAIRS ONCE.
IT'S PRETTY DARN GOOD.

00:35.468 --> 00:44.110
AND HEY -- BROADWAY'S BACK!
THAT'S EXCITING, RIGHT?
YEAH.

00:44.110 --> 00:48.848
[ APPLAUSE ]
SO IS THE TALIBAN.
WIN SOME, LOSE SOME.

00:48.848 --> 00:51.317
UNLIKE OUR LAST PRESIDENT, I TRY
TO STAY OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT.
LIKE AN OIL CHANGE.

00:51.317 --> 01:02.095
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT ME UNTIL
YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.
NOW AMERICA NEEDS ME.

01:02.095 --> 01:06.199
DEMOCRATS NEED ME.
I HAVE A SOCIAL AGENDA I HAVE TO
GET PASSED.

01:06.199 --> 01:13.239
SO NOW I'M BRINGING TOGETHER THE
DEMOCRATS LIKE VOLTRON.
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT COLORS,

01:13.239 --> 01:18.278
BUT FUNDAMENTALLY THEY'RE
ROBOTS.
ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE THE MODERATE

01:18.845 --> 01:25.218
ON ONE SIDE WE HAVE THE MODERATE
DEMOCRATS LIKE KYRSTEN SINEMA
FROM ARIZONA.

01:25.218 --> 01:27.954
WHAT DO I WANT FROM THIS
BILL?
I'LL NEVER TELL BECAUSE I DIDN'T

01:27.954 --> 01:29.923
COME TO CONGRESS TO MAKE
FRIENDS.
AND SO FAR, MISSION

01:29.923 --> 01:32.959
ACCOMPLISHED.
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES SHE
LOOK LIKE ALL OF THE CHARACTERS

01:32.959 --> 01:35.562
FROM "SCOOBY DOO" AT THE SAME
TIME?
AND ANOTHER PAIN IN MY KEISTER

01:35.562 --> 01:38.665
THE DE FACTO PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, JOE MANCHIN FROM
WEST VIRGINIA.

01:38.665 --> 01:44.504
YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M A DEMOCRAT FROM WEST

01:44.504 --> 01:48.274
VIRGINIA.
IF I VOTE FOR ELECTRIC CARS,
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL ME.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.110
ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE HAVE
TWO MEMBERS OF THE PROGRESSIVE
CAUCUS.

01:50.110 --> 01:54.414
ILHAN OMAR FROM MINNESOTA.
THANK YOU, JOE, FOR NOT
CALLING MY KAMALA.

01:54.414 --> 01:58.118
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW
ME, I WAS DESIGNED IN A LAB TO
GIVE TUCKER CARLSON A HEART

01:58.118 --> 02:03.456
ATTACK.
FINALLY, ALEXANDRIA -- I'M
NOT GOING TO TRY TO SAY YOUR

02:03.456 --> 02:09.529
WHOLE NAME.
AOC FROM NUEVA YORK.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

02:09.529 --> 02:17.737
IT'S ME, THE "CRUELLA" OF THE
MET GALA.
I WORE A DRESS THAT SAID "TAX

02:17.737 --> 02:23.109
THE RICH," THEN SPEND THE WHOLE
NIGHT PARTYING WITH THE RICH.
OOPS.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.345
NOW LET'S GET INTO THIS
AGENDA TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'RE
GOING TO REALIZE, HEY, WE'RE ALL

02:25.345 --> 02:27.480
ON THE SAME PAGE.
WE'RE ALL SAYING THE SAME DAMN
THING.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.617
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M SAYING WE NEED AT LEAST
$300 BILLION IN CLEAN ENERGY TAX

02:30.617 --> 02:33.753
CREDITS.
YEAH.
I'M SAYING ZERO.

02:33.753 --> 02:38.425
SEE?
SAME PAGE.
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN

02:38.425 --> 02:43.630
THIS BILL LIKE 12 WEEKS OF PAID
FAMILY LEAVE.
SIX DAYS.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.766
SIX WHOLE DAYS OF PAID --
UNPAID.
UNPAID -- SIX WHOLE DAYS --

02:46.766 --> 02:51.104
NIGHTS --
SIX NIGHTS OF UNPAID --
THAT'S NOT A BAD COMPROMISE,

02:51.104 --> 02:59.512
RIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT IN RETURN?
WHAT ABOUT A CHILD TAX

02:59.512 --> 03:02.849
CREDIT?
GREAT IDEA.
I'VE ALWAYS SAID CHILDREN

03:02.849 --> 03:09.356
SHOULDN'T PAY TAXES.
THAT'S A LOT OF MATH.
BUT IF WE GIVE CHILDREN TOO

03:09.356 --> 03:14.527
MUCH LEEWAY, HOW ARE WE GOING TO
GET THEM TO WORK IN THE MINES?
OKAY, WE NEED THEIR TINY HANDS

03:14.527 --> 03:17.664
TO DIG.
ALL THE BIG PIECES OF COAL ARE
GONE.

03:17.664 --> 03:22.569
WE NEED THE LITTLE KID FINGERS
TO GATHER THE LITTLE PIECES.
OKAY, LET'S GET REAL BASIC.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.337
ROADS.
EVERYONE OKAY WITH ROADS?
I LIKE ROADS.

03:24.337 --> 03:27.474
YEAH, ME, TOO.
ROADS ARE WHERE TRUCKS LIVE.
KYRSTEN?

03:27.474 --> 03:33.179
I WANT NO ROADS.
NO ROADS?
WHY?

03:33.179 --> 03:38.585
CHAOS.
WHAT ABOUT WATER?
WE'RE ALLOTING -- LET'S SEE,

03:38.585 --> 03:40.653
WE'RE ALLOTING 65 BILLION FOR
WATER.
WOW, THAT'S A LOT OF WATER.

03:40.653 --> 03:50.096
DOES IT COME WITH A MERMAID?
NO, IT WAS GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU SAY, JOE, YOU

03:50.096 --> 03:54.768
GOOD WITH WATER?
I DON'T LIKE THE TASTE.
FINE.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.871
LET'S FOCUS ON THE TWO THINGS
THAT POLL BEST WITH ALL
AMERICANS.

03:57.871 --> 04:02.042
LOWERING THE PRICE OF
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS --
NO.

04:02.042 --> 04:05.679
AND RAISING TAXES ON
BILLIONAIRES.
ALL RIGHT THEN.

04:05.679 --> 04:09.349
JUST TELL US, KYRSTEN, WHAT DO
YOU LIKE?
WHAT IS GOOD TO YOU?

04:09.349 --> 04:14.721
YELLOW STARBURSTS.
THE FILM "POLAR EXPRESS."
WHEN SOMEONE EATS FISH ON AN

04:14.721 --> 04:20.293
AIRPLANE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
CAN'T WE COMPROMISE ON

04:20.293 --> 04:25.165
ANYTHING?
ISN'T SOMETHING BETTER THAN
NOTHING?

04:25.165 --> 04:29.269
LOOK, AS A
WINE-DRINKING, BISEXUAL
TRIATHLETE, I KNOW WHAT THE

04:29.269 --> 04:32.906
AVERAGE AMERICAN WANTS.
THEY WANT TO BE PUT ON HOLD WHEN
THEY CALL 9-1-1.

04:32.906 --> 04:37.610
THEY WANT BRIDGES THAT JUST STOP
AND CARS FALL DOWN.
THEY WANT WATER SO THICK YOU CAN

04:37.610 --> 04:42.315
EAT IT WITH A FORK.
AND I WILL FIGHT FOR THAT NO
MATTER WHAT.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.452
UNLESS MY FOOT HURTS.
THEN I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO
ARIZONA.

04:45.452 --> 04:49.589
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ONE

04:49.589 --> 04:56.496
LAST ITEM ON THIS AGENDA.
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE.
DREAMS.

04:56.496 --> 05:02.502
OH, GOD, NOT AGAIN.
OH, COME ON.
DON'T TAKE DREAMS AWAY FROM ME.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.504
WE NEED TO REMIND PEOPLE OF THE
GRANDEUR OF AMERICAN RAIL
TRAVEL.

05:04.504 --> 05:08.341
THE QUIET CAR, THE SEATS THAT
FACE BACKWARDS, THE SLIDING
BATHROOM DOORS THAT DON'T REALLY

05:08.341 --> 05:11.044
LOCK.
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU OPEN IT UP, CATCH A GLIMPSE

05:11.044 --> 05:14.381
OF AN OLD MAN ON A TOILET.
[ LAUGHTER ]
A FULL BOTTLE OF GATORADE

05:14.381 --> 05:18.051
ROLLING AROUND ON THE FLOOR OF
THE TRAIN.
IT GOES THAT WAY, IT GOES BACK.

05:18.051 --> 05:28.695
[ LAUGHTER ]
WITHOUT TRAINS, NO AMERICA.
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING

05:28.695 --> 05:34.534
THIS TO MY WHITE BOSS, BUT IT'S
GOING TO BE OKAY.
IT'S GOING TO BE MORE THAN

05:34.534 --> 05:40.340
TODAY.
TAKE IT FROM ME, GOVERNOR ANDREW
CUOMO.

05:40.340 --> 05:47.080
US GOVERNORS HAVE HAD EACH
OTHER'S BACKS NO MATTER WHAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT ITALIANS LIKE TO

05:47.080 --> 05:51.217
DO?
HUG AND KISS AND RUN THEIR
FINGERS UP EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

05:51.217 --> 06:00.527
SO LET'S ALL COME TOGETHER.
OOPS, BAD CHOICE OF WORDS THERE.
AND LET'S GET THIS BILL PASSED

06:00.527 --> 06:03.096
TODAY.
JUST LIKE ME, IT DESERVES A
SECOND CHANCE.

06:03.096 --> 06:07.267
THEN A THIRD CHANCE.
AND AT LEAST UP TO 11 CHANCES.
OH, AND I WANT TO PLUG MY NEW

06:07.267 --> 06:09.469
BOOK.
MY FIRST WAS CALLED "LESSONS IN
LEADERSHIP."

06:09.469 --> 06:12.038
AND MY NEW ONE IS CALLED
"WHOOPS."
[ LAUGHTER ]

06:12.038 --> 06:14.741
AND I'M PROMOTING MY NEW
BOOK.
"SANDWICHES I HAVE LIKED AND

06:14.741 --> 06:21.681
TRIED."
[ LAUGHTER ]
HELLO.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.483
I'M CHUCK SCHUMER.
YOU MAY REMEMBER ME, BUT YOU
DON'T.

06:23.483 --> 06:29.656
[ LAUGHTER ]
I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED OUR LITTLE
RAP SESS.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.758
YOU KNOW.
NEXT TIME YOU GET AN EMAIL FROM
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WITH A

06:31.758 --> 06:42.268
SCARY, DESPERATE SUBJECT LINE
LIKE, "IT'S ALL OVER, JENNIFER.
DEMOCRACY IS DEAD UNLESS YOU

06:42.268 --> 07:09.429
DONATE $7 NOW!
**
**

08:53.533 --> 09:05.512
MUSICAL GUEST KACEY MUSGRAVES.
AND YOUR HOST OWEN WILSON.
**

09:05.512 --> 09:14.888
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
OWEN WILSON!
**

09:14.888 --> 09:29.703
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

09:29.703 --> 09:34.774
THANK YOU.
HELLO.
YES, WE ARE DOING IT.

09:34.774 --> 09:41.848
THE SEASON PREMIER OF "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE".
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

09:41.848 --> 09:46.052
NOW, A LOT HAD CHANGED SINCE
LAST SEASON.
THE VACCINE CAME OUT EVERYWHERE

09:46.052 --> 09:52.092
EXCEPT FLORIDA.
AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WENT
BACK TO NORMAL FOR ABOUT A WEEK

09:52.092 --> 09:56.062
AND A HALF.
BUT IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE HERE
AROUND PEOPLE AGAIN.

09:56.062 --> 10:05.839
I'VE GOT MY TWO BROTHERS HERE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
NOW, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE I'M A

10:05.839 --> 10:11.644
LITTLE BIT NERVOUS TO BE HERE,
BUT I'M GOING TO USE SOMETHING I
LEARNED GROWING UP BEING A

10:11.644 --> 10:15.648
MIDDLE CHILD WHERE SOMETIMES
YOU'RE THE FORGOTTEN ONE SO YOU
HAVE TO TAP INTO THIS FEELING

10:15.648 --> 10:20.253
WITH YOUR PARENTS THAT'S LIKE,
HEY, GET A LOAD OF ME.
OF COURSE, IF YOU TAP INTO THAT

10:20.253 --> 10:27.961
FEELING TOO MUCH, YOU MAY FIND
YOURSELF AT MILITARY SCHOOL IN
NEW MEXICO AT 16 LIKE I DID.

10:27.961 --> 10:36.736
MY DAD ALWAYS SAID HE WAS THE
CHARTER MEMBER OF THE 3790 CLUB,
WHICH THREE SONS, 7 HIGH

10:36.736 --> 10:44.678
SCHOOLS, 9 COLLEGES, 0 DEGREES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
WHICH WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY

10:44.678 --> 10:50.316
GENEROUS OF MY DAD TO PUT IT
LIKE THAT BECAUSE MY BROTHERS
ONLY WENT TO ONE HIGH SCHOOL AND

10:50.316 --> 10:54.754
COLLEGE EACH.
BUT, REASON, I'M EXCITED TO BE
HERE DOING SOMETHING LIVE.

10:54.754 --> 10:59.859
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT MUSICIANS
TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU GET THAT
INSTANT FEEDBACK FROM THE CROWD

10:59.859 --> 11:04.497
BECAUSE, OF COURSE, WHEN YOU DO
A MOVIE, YOU DO IT AND WAIT A
YEAR TO HEAR HOW YOU DID.

11:04.497 --> 11:09.102
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE TONIGHT.
REVIEWS WILL BE COMING IN
IMMEDIATELY.

11:09.102 --> 11:14.074
PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY TWEETING
REVIEWS RIGHT NOW.
AND I KNOW THEY SAY DON'T READ

11:14.074 --> 11:19.746
REVIEWS OR ACTUALLY THEY SAY IF
YOU READ THE GOOD ONES, YOU GOT
TO READ THE BAD ONES.

11:19.746 --> 11:23.817
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
[ LAUGHING ]
I JUST READ THE GOOD ONES.

11:23.817 --> 11:31.091
I REALLY FIND THAT THE BAD ONES,
THEY DON'T REALLY SPEAK TO ME IN
THE SAME WAY.

11:31.091 --> 11:37.664
NOW ROT TON TOMATOES HAS THAT
GREEN THING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO
STAY AWAY FROM.

11:37.664 --> 11:41.768
HOWEVER, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A
BAD ONE WILL MAKE IT PASSED MY
RADAR.

11:41.768 --> 11:49.342
ONE BAD ONE SAID OWEN WILSON'S
ON SCREEN PERSONA HAS ALL THE
AMBITIOUS OF AN OLD GOLDEN

11:49.342 --> 11:54.381
RETRIEVER LAYING NEXT TO A FIRE.
[ LAUGHING ]
AND IT KIND OF GOT WORSE FROM

11:54.381 --> 11:58.752
THERE.
AND, YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST, I
PROBABLY HAVE BEEN GUILTY AT

11:58.752 --> 12:06.326
TIMES OF COASTING A LITTLE,
TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE PEDAL,
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN

12:06.326 --> 12:11.965
DANIEL DAY-LEWIS RETIRED AND ALL
THAT PRESSURE LANDED ON MY
SHOULDERS, EVERYTHING CHANGED.

12:11.965 --> 12:22.709
AND THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I HAD TO
DO "CARS 3."
AND REALLY --

12:22.709 --> 12:26.980
[ APPLAUSE ]
AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT
TONIGHT IS ABOUT, TAKING

12:26.980 --> 12:30.850
CHANCES, SPREADING YOUR WINGS AS
AN ARTIST.
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO

12:30.850 --> 12:34.421
GO CRAZY.
YOU GOT TO PACE YOURSELF.
AND IS IT THE WORST THING IN THE

12:34.421 --> 12:39.259
WORLD BEING A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
LAYING NEXT TO A FIRE?
I MEAN, I KNOW EVERYONE COMES

12:39.259 --> 12:44.698
OUT HERE AND SAYS IT'S GOING TO
BE A GREAT SHOW.
IS IT?

12:44.698 --> 12:48.535
[ LAUGHING ]
I MEAN, I'M BETTING ON IT, OF
COURSE.

12:48.535 --> 12:52.205
I'M BETTING ON A LOT OF THINGS
LATELY.
I HAVE A BIT OF A GAMBLING

12:52.205 --> 12:56.343
PROBLEM.
BUT, HEY, WHAT WE LOSE ON THE
ROOMS WE MAKE ON THE SANDWICHES,

12:56.343 --> 13:01.147
RIGHT?
SO I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO
SAY IS PUT ON YOUR COZIEST

13:01.147 --> 13:08.121
FLANNEL AND MAYBE WE JUST CHILL
OUT FOR THE NEXT 90 MINUTES.
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND GET COMFY.

13:08.121 --> 13:13.393
I KNOW THEY SAID, OWEN, COME ON.
WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE TO BE SLEEPING.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.630
YEAH, BUT ALSO I'M NOT GOING TO
STAND HERE AND TELL PEOPLE NOT
TO DREAM.

13:17.630 --> 13:23.103
AND IN MY AMERICA, MOST PEOPLE
DREAM BETTER WITH THEIR EYES
CLOSED.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.773
NOW, COME ON.
WHO'S WITH ME?
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

13:26.773 --> 13:29.075
TONIGHT.
KACEY MUSGRAVES IS HERE, SO
STICK AROUND AND WE'LL BE RIGHT

13:29.075 --> 13:35.448
STICK AROUND AND WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.
APPLAUSE

13:42.789 --> 13:47.494
TALKING," WHERE WE DISCUSS
EVERYTHING THAT WOMEN CAN HAVE
AN OPINION ABOUT AT 11:30 IN THE

13:47.494 --> 13:55.435
MORNING.
LATER WE'LL TALK ABOUT BIDEN'S
INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS, BUT FIRST

13:55.435 --> 13:59.706
CROCK POT LASAGNA.
NOW THIS SOUNDS GROSS TO ME.
ANYONE ELSE?

13:59.706 --> 14:02.308
I HAVE A QUESTION.
WHAT'S AN AIR FRYER?
WHAT IS THIS?

14:02.308 --> 14:07.213
LADIES, IF SOMETHINGS FRIED,
I WON'T EAT IT.
DO NOT TALK LIKE THAT.

14:07.213 --> 14:10.250
NOW, LOOK, AS YOU ALL KNOW,
MY HUSBAND
IS VERY WELL ENDOWED, OKAY.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.486
AND HE ACTUALLY COOKS DINNER FOR
US, AND HE LOVES THE AIR FRYER.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT I DON'T

14:13.486 --> 14:18.058
GET.
HOW DOES AIR FRY SOMETHING?
HOW DOES AIR MAKE IT FRY?

14:18.058 --> 14:21.895
OKAY, CHARLOTTE, NONE OF US
KNOW.
AND I DON'T REALLY LOVED HOW YOU

14:21.895 --> 14:23.730
ASKED THAT.
SORRY.
YOU HAVE --

14:23.730 --> 14:28.935
YOU --
HOW DID I ASK?
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

14:28.935 --> 14:33.606
MOVING ON.
THE STOCK MARKET.
MMM.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.242
I LIKE IT.
SEE, I DO, TOO.
YEAH.

14:36.242 --> 14:39.879
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
LADIES KNOW THIS, BUT --
DON'T SAY IT.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.550
WELL, YOU KNOW I GOT TO SAY
IT, AND I WAS GOING TO SAY --
GO AHEAD.

14:43.550 --> 14:49.856
WELL, MY HUSBAND IS VERY WELL
ENDOWED.
YEAH, YOU SAID THAT.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.925
YEAH.
YOUR CHILDREN ARE RUDE.
YOU'RE A BAD FRIEND.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.793
YOU'RE A BAD FRIEND.
LADIES, LADIES, PLEASE.
LADIES, ENOUGH.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.429
ENOUGH.
ENOUGH.
HELLO.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.066
I'M SORRY, I NEED TO INFORM YOU
OF YOUR COVID TEST RESULTS.
OH, HI.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.869

YES, MA'AM.
I JUST RECEIVED THEM, AND THIS

15:02.869 --> 15:05.505
IS WHERE YOU ARE SO I BROUGHT
THEM HERE.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONFIRM

15:05.505 --> 15:08.408
SOME INFORMATION.
OKAY.
BUT DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS ON

15:08.408 --> 15:11.044
AIR?
YEAH.
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT ON TV FOR

15:11.044 --> 15:14.147
HIPAA REASONS.
NOW, WE EITHER CAN'T TELL
ANYBODY OR HAVE TO TELL

15:14.147 --> 15:19.352
EVERYBODY, NO MIDDLE GROUND.
OKAY.
CAN I GET YOUR FULL NAME?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.421
DIDI CALRISION.
CORRECT.
DATE OF BIRTH?

15:21.421 --> 15:28.728
MAY 13th.
MAY 13th WHAT?
1982.

15:28.728 --> 15:36.903
DAMN, DIDI, YOU ARE YOUNGER
THAN YOU LOOK.
THANKS.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.672
WAIT -- HEY.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN THE
LAST 72 HOURS?

15:38.672 --> 15:40.774
LIKE IN GENERAL?
YES.
CAME TO WORK.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.944
GOOGLED MYSELF.
I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.080
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, THE COVID
TEST CAME BACK POSITIVE.
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME

15:47.080 --> 15:50.650
WITH ME.
OH, NO.
WELL, BYE, EVERYBODY.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.787
WOW.
WOW.
VIEWERS, IT LOOKS LIKE DIDI HAD

15:53.787 --> 15:56.923
A BREAKTHROUGH CASE.
IT HAPPENS.
IT HAPPENS.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.992
OBVIOUSLY, WE'VE ALL BEEN
VACCINATED.
DOZENS, DOZENS, AND DOZENS OF

15:58.992 --> 16:04.330
TIMES.
YEAH.
WOW.

16:04.330 --> 16:07.567
WELL, SHE IS GOING TO BE SAD
TO MISS THIS NEXT SEGMENT.
BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING TO THE

16:07.567 --> 16:10.270
LEADER OF THE VATICAN HIMSELF,
THE POPE.
NOW, HELP ME OUT.

16:10.270 --> 16:22.048
IS IT THE POPE OR DA POPE?
I THINK IT'S JUST POPE.
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

16:22.048 --> 16:31.091
OKAY.
