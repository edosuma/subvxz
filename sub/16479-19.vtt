WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:05.704
So I really want to ask
what's in the box, but, uh,

00:05.706 --> 00:07.773
it'll ignite
a whole<i> Seven</i> thing.

00:07.775 --> 00:10.342
"What's in the box?
What's in the box?"

00:10.344 --> 00:12.177
"Repeat, John Doe
has the upper hand."

00:12.179 --> 00:13.612
I have got to see this movie.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.614
You guys make it sound
so hilarious.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.982
Anyway, my former boss,

00:16.984 --> 00:18.150
Principal Foster,

00:18.152 --> 00:20.519
survived a real dicey safari
in Africa.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.687
His takeaway was that

00:21.689 --> 00:24.289
material possessions
mean nothing.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.691
Including his collection

00:25.693 --> 00:28.560
of super fancy, old-ass wine.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.063
The lions came at night.

00:31.065 --> 00:34.133
That put everything
in perspective.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.301
Everything, dawg.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.903
Ooh.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.705
Jess, thank you.
This is perfect.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.174
Cece and I are completely moved
into Jaipur Aviv.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.376
So tonight, we'll be doing it
for the first time

00:44.378 --> 00:46.812
on our first night
in our first house.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.213
And I'm going
to Aly's tonight. Yeah.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.582
Gonna be doing it
for the 10,000th time

00:50.584 --> 00:52.017
on our 1,000th night

00:52.019 --> 00:54.920
in her... 100th apartment?

00:54.922 --> 00:56.188
You think Aly's
lived in 100 apartments?

00:56.190 --> 00:58.390
I hadn't, I hadn't crunched
the numbers on it.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.426
So, Reagan's out of town
till tomorrow.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.227
What are you and Nick
gonna do tonight?

01:02.229 --> 01:04.596
What makes you assume
I'm hanging out with Nick?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.698
I'm sorry.
What are you doing tonight?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.100
(mumbles):
Picking out clothes for Nick.

01:08.102 --> 01:09.601
What? I can't hear you.
I'm helping Nick

01:09.603 --> 01:11.036
pick out an outfit.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.237
I... We have
to nail down

01:12.239 --> 01:14.440
his look for SOCALYALCON 6.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.075
Wow, SOCALYALCON 6. Wow.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.544
I can't believe it's been
a whole year since the last

01:18.546 --> 01:21.046
Southern California Young Adult
Literature Conference.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.448
NICK: You're a
12-year-old girl.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.050
You spent $35
to meet me.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.519
Is this what you want me
to look like?

01:27.521 --> 01:31.023
I got two questions:
uh, where'd I get $35 from,

01:31.025 --> 01:33.659
and also,
can my name be Daphne?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.995
♪ ♪

01:38.966 --> 01:40.966
And I read that authors
should all have a strong look,

01:40.968 --> 01:42.734
so I found four authors
with strong looks,

01:42.736 --> 01:44.036
and I combined them.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.071
Tom Wolfe: white suit.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.073
Hunter S. Thompson:
yellow sunglasses.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.641
David Foster Wallace: bandana.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.978
Toni Morrison: The Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.413
Here you go.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.115
Well, that's perfect, Jess.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.983
Well, it was easy.
You have very few clothing items

01:57.985 --> 01:58.984
in your closet.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.120
Also, are those
your tax returns?

02:01.122 --> 02:02.754
And why are you drying beef?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.156
Because I don't have
a file cabinet,

02:04.158 --> 02:06.792
and because I couldn't eat
all the meat in one night.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.093
Now...
That's gross.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.394
How do I look?

02:09.396 --> 02:10.896
What you need is a navy blazer.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.931
Do you have a navy blazer
or just the pit boss special?

02:12.933 --> 02:17.002
What kind of a man
owns multiple blazers?

02:17.004 --> 02:18.971
(snickering)

02:18.973 --> 02:21.073
SCHMIDT: Ha! There's so many
places for sex!

02:21.075 --> 02:22.107
(moans)

02:22.109 --> 02:24.009
(panting):
All right.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.744
That makes it official.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.679
Houses are way better
than apartments.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.915
Now that we're out of closets,
watch out laundry room.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.783
(chuckles)
(exhales)

02:31.785 --> 02:33.152
Know what that sound is?
Hmm?

02:33.154 --> 02:35.587
That is the absence of Nick.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.289
The lack of Winston.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.457
(knocking on door)

02:38.459 --> 02:39.525
What was that?

02:39.527 --> 02:40.692
Someone's hitting at our house.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.594
It sounded like,
like, a, like, knocking.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.929
Yeah, but the-the door
is that way.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.030
Oh, my God, I totally forgot.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.331
We have a back door.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.800
BOTH:
Houses have a back door.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.302
(laughs)

02:50.304 --> 02:53.038
What kind of person
comes to a back door?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.540
Jeremy.
On behalf of the neighborhood,

02:54.542 --> 02:57.676
may I be the first
to say, welcome, sir.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.845
"A Guide to Your
New Neighborhood by Jeremy."

02:59.847 --> 03:01.280
I didn't know you lived nearby.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.781
I don't. But I will someday.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.017
Just as I will do everything
that you have done.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.452
(grunts) That's the tone
that we talked about, Jeremy.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.787
No, thank you.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.156
I can't wait to have
a servants' entrance.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.958
Let's not call it that.
Two points of entry.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.660
Very well done, sir.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.662
Cece, I just thought
of another reason

03:16.664 --> 03:18.197
why houses are better
than apartments.

03:18.199 --> 03:20.532
Now we can enjoy
two points of entry!

03:20.534 --> 03:21.633
CECE:
No, thanks!

03:21.635 --> 03:23.035
I'm talking about the doors.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.203
I-I didn't mean...

03:24.205 --> 03:25.404
ALY:
<i> So a lion scares</i>

03:25.406 --> 03:28.006
Jess's old boss in Nigeria,

03:28.008 --> 03:32.144
and we get so drunk we have sex
on a dresser in America.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.147
What a world.

03:35.149 --> 03:37.182
It's all connected, baby.
(chuckles)

03:37.184 --> 03:40.185
And the broken dresser,
that's my fault.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.486
I'm all haunch.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.854
I'll buy you a new one.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.056
You don't have to.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.024
Because guess
who has two dressers.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.026
Rip Torn.
No. Me.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.261
I mean, you<i> and</i> Rip Torn.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.395
Stop talking about Rip Torn.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.396
You have a backup dresser?
Yeah.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.332
Just when I thought
you couldn't

03:53.334 --> 03:54.566
get any more perfect.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.002
It's in my...

03:57.004 --> 03:59.004
Ugh, my storage unit.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.405
I-I'll get it tomorrow.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.074
A dresser's pretty
big; I could help you.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.675
That's okay.
I'll just get it tomorrow.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.877
I mean, my day is wide open...
I said no!

04:05.879 --> 04:08.013
(quietly):
Okay.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.882
"A Guide to Your New
Neighborhood by Jeremy"

04:10.884 --> 04:12.417
is very comprehensive.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.519
Yes, the fact that we're
in between a raisin house

04:14.521 --> 04:16.088
and a toothbrush house
makes me feel

04:16.090 --> 04:17.489
very confident about Halloween.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.625
Crime statistics?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.892
We have crime?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.729
Crime that
warrants statistics?

04:23.731 --> 04:26.265
Oh, my God. It says there were
14 home invasions last year.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.133
Up six percent from 2015?

04:28.135 --> 04:29.635
Okay, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

04:29.637 --> 04:32.070
W-We're just gonna get
worked up about nothing.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.039
Right? There are only
two ways into this place,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.741
the front door and the back door
and we've locked them both.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.075
We're good, we're good.
We're good.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.043
Yeah, we're good.
Yeah, no. It's fine.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.044
Yeah. We're fine.
I just...

04:39.046 --> 04:40.078
Yeah.
Okay.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.914
Okay.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.416
At the risk
of sounding cliché,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.285
should we have sex
in the bedroom?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.953
I think that's
a great idea.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.554
(chuckles)
(clattering)

04:49.556 --> 04:51.123
(gasps, shrieks)
The hell was that?!

04:51.125 --> 04:52.257
Are you the criminals?!

04:52.259 --> 04:54.059
From the statistics?!

04:54.061 --> 04:55.560
(Nick groaning)

04:55.562 --> 04:57.729
(shouts)
Oh, what are you doing?
Oh!

04:57.731 --> 04:59.731
I almost hit you with
this brushed steel modern lamp.
Really?

04:59.733 --> 05:02.167
I am sorry we broke in, but I'm
also pretty impressed with us.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.002
What kind of taco meat
you bitches have?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.305
(Nick and Jess laugh)
SCHMIDT: I told you,

05:06.307 --> 05:07.506
if we locked both the doors,

05:07.508 --> 05:08.974
our guests would know

05:08.976 --> 05:10.942
to come in
through the windows.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.645
Our ground floor windows.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.347
You see?
What started out as snark

05:15.349 --> 05:16.982
has become a real eye-opener.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.484
What did you want us to do? Ring
the bell and wake you guys up?

05:19.486 --> 05:21.119
Oh, no. Thank God you
didn't wake us up.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.488
See? I told you they'd be cool.
Ask him.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.690
You were right.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.158
Schmidt, here's my question.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.427
Apologies.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.962
My author look
is missing one thing...

05:30.964 --> 05:33.598
Navy blue, medium weight,
two button. I know the blazer.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.100
Nick, listen to me.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.970
If you ever, ever need a blazer,
I don't care how late it is,

05:38.972 --> 05:40.972
till the day I die,
you wake me up.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.140
Thanks.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.009
Okay.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.344
We're gonna have
a conversation.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.712
I am a little concerned.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.213
I know.
What if the blazer doesn't fit?

05:48.215 --> 05:50.182
No. About you and Nick.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.718
And about how you're being
his girlfriend.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.785
You mean being his good friend.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.187
I mean being his girlfriend.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.488
A good friend
will maybe

05:56.490 --> 05:58.557
drive someone to the mall
in the daytime

05:58.559 --> 06:00.892
so that they can buy a blazer.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.862
They don't go on a giggly
late night crime date

06:03.864 --> 06:05.897
so that they can steal one.

06:05.899 --> 06:06.965
That's girlfriend stuff.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.036
You've been doing a lot
of girlfriend stuff lately.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.972
"Godfather of Soul, blank
Brown." Five letters.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.807
Bubba.
Okay.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.576
Wait, you want to know
who wins in a fight

06:17.578 --> 06:20.011
between Winston Bishop
and Winston Churchill?

06:20.013 --> 06:22.814
Hey, do you know what
this book's about?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.916
Bayou n-noir.

06:24.918 --> 06:25.884
Uh, Pepperwood,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.086
he's a private investigator...

06:28.088 --> 06:30.222
It's about a man who has
nothing, who risks everything,

06:30.224 --> 06:31.423
to feel something.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.191
Thank you.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.659
None of that's girlfriend stuff.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.261
That's all good friend stuff.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.930
Okay, let me, uh, toss out
a hypothetical to you, okay?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.933
Nick has a piece of lint

06:41.935 --> 06:43.435
on his sleeve.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.905
Do you go, "Hey, bud, you got
some lint on your sleeve"?

06:46.907 --> 06:49.040
Or do you pick it off?

06:49.042 --> 06:51.410
I don't see how that's relevant.
Yes, you do.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.712
Because you are a rabid watcher
of<i> The Crown.</i>

06:53.714 --> 06:55.247
I watch a lot of shows.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.182
And so therefore,
you know that picking lint

06:57.184 --> 07:00.519
off of a man's sleeve
is the most intimate gesture.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.621
I just leave it there.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.023
A little piece of lint
on his sleeve.

07:05.025 --> 07:05.924
I wouldn't do anything.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.692
What would you just want to...

07:07.694 --> 07:11.129
Fine! I'd want to pick it off
with my bare hands!

07:11.932 --> 07:13.832
Oh, my God.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.601
I'm the girlfriend.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.275
I'm so nervous for SOCALYALCON 6
that I lost my appetite.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.043
But then I found my appetite,
but now,

07:25.045 --> 07:26.945
now that I found my appetite,
nothing sounds good.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.413
Mm, sounds like you're in
a complicated way, my man.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.581
You know what actually
does sound good?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.383
The cake you made
on the Fourth of July.

07:31.385 --> 07:32.884
Would you make it again?

07:32.886 --> 07:35.387
You want me to make a, uh,
an American flag sheet cake

07:35.389 --> 07:36.788
in March?
Yes.

07:36.790 --> 07:37.956
It'll be fun.
We'll do it together.

07:37.958 --> 07:38.990
You get to wear this.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.126
Okay. My favorite apron.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.327
You know what, no!

07:42.329 --> 07:43.962
No, I'm not doing
this anymore.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.965
Anymore? We've never
made a cake together.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.467
Wait, have we?

07:48.469 --> 07:50.502
If we have,
I don't remember. I drink.

07:50.504 --> 07:54.172
No, not... no,
not just this. All of it.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.208
All the girlfriend stuff.
It's not fair.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.278
All right. Sorry.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.980
I-I didn't know
you felt that way.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.816
No. (scoffs)
I don't feel that way, I...

08:04.818 --> 08:05.817
But you said unfair.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.818
Yeah, I did.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.787
I said that 'cause I--

08:08.789 --> 08:10.789
if-- I feel it is unfair.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.090
To Reagan.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.658
She's your girlfriend,

08:13.660 --> 08:14.993
I'm your good friend.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.761
She, you know, she should...

08:16.763 --> 08:18.530
she should get to make you
sheet cake.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.031
Yeah, that makes sense.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.001
I just need to make
something clear between us.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.636
If that's okay.

08:24.638 --> 08:28.440
You're saying "sheet"
like "ghost clothes,"

08:28.442 --> 08:30.041
not like
"in a toilet," right?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.413
Whoa.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.883
I taught English in Japan

08:37.885 --> 08:40.452
for a couple years
after college and...

08:40.454 --> 08:41.987
I fell in with a bad crowd.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.856
It was a time in my life
I'm not proud of.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.591
I fell in with...

08:47.561 --> 08:49.661
...with a Japanese
game show crowd.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.196
(speaking Japanese)

08:51.198 --> 08:52.964
Which one?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.466
(speaking Japanese)
This one?

08:54.468 --> 08:56.167
This one or this one?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.069
I don't understand you!
(announcer and crowd
chanting in Japanese)

08:58.071 --> 08:59.004
Okay.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.006
(bell dinging, crowd cheering)

09:01.008 --> 09:02.073
(announcer speaking Japanese)

09:02.075 --> 09:03.008
(shouting in Japanese)

09:03.010 --> 09:05.076
Oh, my God, I did it!

09:05.078 --> 09:08.480
I did it! I did it!

09:08.482 --> 09:09.481
(yells)

09:09.483 --> 09:10.916
I did it!

09:10.918 --> 09:13.351
I was a ten-time
top master champion

09:13.353 --> 09:15.887
on<i> Protocol of Best Enjoyment.</i>

09:16.423 --> 09:17.923
These are the spoils.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.257
Question:

09:19.259 --> 09:21.526
is that hippo
rideable?

09:21.528 --> 09:22.928
(whoops, laughs)

09:22.930 --> 09:24.362
(whoops)

09:24.364 --> 09:26.264
Those day laborers
were right.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.033
This stuff is awesome.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.068
Why was I so embarrassed
for you to see it?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.238
If this is your deep, dark,
embarrassing secret,

09:33.240 --> 09:34.906
then I am worried for you to see

09:34.908 --> 09:36.207
what's buried
in my storage unit.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.609
I feel like I'm pretty
up-to-date

09:37.611 --> 09:39.044
on your embarrassing secrets.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.211
Oh, honey.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.681
I have chapters in my life
you know nothing about.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.349
Wait, really?
Here we go.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.954
I once sold knives door-to-door
in high school.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.357
And...
Byron Allen knocked me out.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.726
Yeah, that was, like, the first
thing you told me when we met.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.528
Oh, yeah. (laughs)

09:56.530 --> 09:59.130
I do use that as an icebreaker,
I forgot.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.534
Well, here's one from
deep in the storage unit.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.568
Way in the back.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.471
I once got my foot stuck
in a go-kart.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.073
And I had to...

10:08.075 --> 10:09.608
Hop six laps alongside of it.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.110
I've been kicked out of
multiple focus groups for...

10:12.112 --> 10:13.244
for crying too much.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.646
That happened yesterday,
and I was with you.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.981
I fell asleep in study hall.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.416
Had a very loud sex dream.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.119
That happened
to my family member,

10:21.121 --> 10:22.988
and I relayed the story to you.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.923
I fell asleep in a bathtub.
Knew that.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.125
And I once dislocated my thumb
getting off a couch.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.627
Okay, you got five more minutes
on that hippo,

10:28.629 --> 10:29.694
and then we switch.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.933
JESS: (groans)
What was wrong with me?

10:34.935 --> 10:37.302
Well... (chuckles)
nothing in this picture.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.104
Hello, gorgeous.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.139
Crop and keep.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.140
(music playing nearby)

10:42.142 --> 10:44.109
Reagan!

10:44.111 --> 10:45.110
Hi.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.344
How do you get
off a plane

10:46.346 --> 10:48.313
and still look dewy as hell?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.081
Uh, I made a deal with the devil

10:50.083 --> 10:52.117
some time ago.
(laughs)

10:52.119 --> 10:53.518
Hey, I'm the
blue words.
Too late.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.120
We're going with it.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.689
Well, welcome back! Sorry.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.991
(chuckles) I don't know why
I'm still shouting.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.459
Um, so Nick told me

11:01.461 --> 11:03.161
about what's been going on
with you two.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.797
Oh, he did? Listen, Reagan...

11:05.799 --> 11:07.766
No, you listen to me.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.634
The next time I
find out that my man

11:09.636 --> 11:12.604
has been coming
to you for cake...

11:12.606 --> 11:14.939
I'm gonna take you out.

11:14.941 --> 11:15.974
To dinner.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.609
To say thank you.
(chuckles)

11:17.611 --> 11:19.344
Because I hate baking.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.012
(both chuckle)

11:21.014 --> 11:22.981
Speaking of dinner, why wait?
Why don't we do that tonight?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.383
About Nick, um...

11:25.385 --> 11:27.152
Jess, you don't have to change
your relationship

11:27.154 --> 11:28.286
with Nick because of me.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.621
I'm not a jealous person.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.123
But thank you
for thinking of me.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.124
That's very nice.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.726
You're a really good friend.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.962
And that is why...
I got you this gift.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.497
Oh, expensive jewelry.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.999
(chuckles nervously)

11:41.001 --> 11:42.901
Classic friend gift.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.135
Thank you, friend.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.371
But I don't have
anything for you.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.706
Except this nice wink.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.973
And here it comes.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.141
And bam.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.509
(chuckles)

11:51.511 --> 11:52.744
Oh, you're really tense.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.145
Yeah, you don't have to do that.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.914
My-my tension's what drives me.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.016
Oh, no, I want to.
Mm-hmm.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.150
I don't have a lot of friends
that are girls.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.019
Mm.
Oh, my God,

12:01.021 --> 12:02.721
I think you're
my first girlfriend.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.224
I'm sure you're missing someone,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.026
like, from high school
or college.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.594
Somebody? A cousin?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.167
Good night, babe.
Good night.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.869
Mm.
Exhausted.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.738
I know. I feel so safe.

12:19.740 --> 12:20.572
So, here's the thing.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.706

Devil woman!

12:21.708 --> 12:23.041
How are you
doing that?

12:23.043 --> 12:25.110
I just had a four-hour dinner
with Reagan.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.213
At which, we shared something
called "The Lovers' Pork."

12:28.215 --> 12:29.681
Cece, it's
getting worse.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.416
I'm both their girlfriends.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.056
How did you get
in here, Jess?
Through the doggy door.

12:38.058 --> 12:38.957
There's a doggy door?
Well, it's flush
with the people door,

12:38.959 --> 12:40.091
and it's painted shut,

12:40.093 --> 12:41.426
so I really had to
put my head into it.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.695
God, I don't want to
be both their girlfriends.

12:43.697 --> 12:46.631
Why do they both need me
so much all of a sudden?

12:46.633 --> 12:47.966
BOTH:
All of a sudden?!

12:47.968 --> 12:49.734
This is why you should
tell Nick how you feel.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.035
Even if
nothing comes of it.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.704
She came here
to see you.

12:52.706 --> 12:55.039
I bet you're reading into it.
What if I go talk to her?

12:55.041 --> 12:56.574
So I fly you down,

12:56.576 --> 12:58.209
you are my gift to Nick.
I'm in.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.577
Have you talked to Reagan
about this?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.212
I bet she'd be awesome
to talk to.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.114
Just tell him you believe in him
and that he can do it.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.649
Just go talk to Reagan.

13:04.651 --> 13:05.550
So, work it out.

13:05.552 --> 13:06.951
You know who you
should talk to

13:06.953 --> 13:08.086
about this,
because he could answer

13:08.088 --> 13:08.920
all your questions, is Nick.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.121
No. No.
Nick!

13:10.123 --> 13:12.290
(gasps) Oh, my God.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.992
It's not all of a sudden.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.126
They've needed me all along.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.327
SCHMIDT and CECE:
Yeah.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.896
Am I the only reason
they're together?

13:17.898 --> 13:18.997
SCHMIDT and CECE:
Yeah.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.899
Am I the architect
of my own nightmare?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.333
Okay, no, no, no, no.
Honey, it's not like

13:22.335 --> 13:23.334
you introduced them
or something.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.669
Well, they did
just get together

13:24.671 --> 13:27.105
because she left
for jury duty.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.574
I've pushed those two together
like a god on Mount Olympus,

13:29.576 --> 13:31.342
too cheap to pay for porn.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.978
No, no, no, it's like
their relationship is a flood

13:33.980 --> 13:35.980
that's about to happen
and you're the little Dutch boy

Well, no more.

out of them.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.787

13:42.789 --> 13:44.455

Dutch boys or...

13:45.926 --> 13:47.759
god porn? I know, pandas.

13:47.761 --> 13:48.660
I'm a zookeeper.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.527
They are my panda.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.695
What?
What?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.330
Pandas wouldn't be alive
without humans.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.965
They can't run,
they can't growl,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.301
they can't even mate without us.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.670
Have you been helping
Nick and Reagan mate?

13:58.672 --> 13:59.704
In a way, yes.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.005
But I'm done.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.374
This zookeeper is through
handing out bamboo.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.776
Reagan and Nick deserve

14:04.778 --> 14:07.145
a chance to see if they can
survive on their own.

14:07.147 --> 14:11.282
Yes, and the zookeeper
deserves a chance to...

14:11.284 --> 14:14.319
be on a late night show
with hilarious animals

14:14.321 --> 14:15.220
that...

14:15.222 --> 14:17.355
poop on the... host's--

14:17.357 --> 14:18.957

what am I saying anymore?

14:18.959 --> 14:19.791
I don't know.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.459
I don't even know. Look, honey,

14:21.461 --> 14:25.463
you... you
deserve the right

14:25.465 --> 14:27.165
to do what's
best for you.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.734
Well... (sighs)

14:29.736 --> 14:31.002
that, too.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.471

It's 11:45.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.443
What?!
What? Oh, no, no,
no, no. Come on.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.912
TRAMPOLINE: Farewell,
emperors of trampoline.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.513
Look, sorry, Jess,
but we got to be

15:15.515 --> 15:17.448
at the station
in less than 15 minutes.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.752
Oh! I just figured out something
that you definitely do not know.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.054
I blew my nose once
and a bug came out.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.422
We were all there
when that happened.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.357
That was at my birthday brunch.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.359
Hey, Jess!
Oh, hey, guys.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.094
I can't talk;
I have so much paper to fold.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.796
REAGAN: Well, you better
get it all folded tonight,

15:31.798 --> 15:33.264
because guess where
you are being

15:33.266 --> 15:35.033
whisked away to tomorrow.
(chuckles)

15:35.035 --> 15:37.268
Palm Springs, California,
where the only thing

15:37.270 --> 15:39.370
hotter than the weather are
the gay senior citizens

15:39.372 --> 15:40.805
and SOCALYALCON 6.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.040
Jess, we've been talking about

15:42.042 --> 15:43.408
how much we appreciate
your friendship

15:43.410 --> 15:45.376
and how close we both
feel to you, right?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.078
Yeah, that's right.
Well, I, too, have, um,

15:47.080 --> 15:48.780
felt that closeness, and, um...

15:48.782 --> 15:50.114
That's why we
got you this.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.649
Oh, no.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.451
That is for you now.
No.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.153
This<i> and</i> a necklace?
(chuckles)

15:55.155 --> 15:58.122
♪ Neck, neck, neck, neck,
na-neck, neck, neck ♪

15:58.124 --> 16:00.058
♪ Neck's all loaded up. ♪

16:00.060 --> 16:01.626
Uh, but seriously,
I can't accept this.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.928
It's-it's too, um, expensive.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.163
Money is no object.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.232
That's why we rented
a custom van,

16:08.234 --> 16:10.234
and even got space radio.
Satellite radio.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.836
No, space radio, the
one that connects to

16:11.838 --> 16:13.805
everything in the air.
There's a satellite.

16:13.807 --> 16:14.939
What, the satellite's
in the ground?

16:14.941 --> 16:16.341
No, the satellite is in the air.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.342
Right. Space.
In the air.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.977
Yeah.
Satellite radio.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.812
And don't you worry
about accommodations,

16:20.814 --> 16:22.347
because we also
took care of that.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.848
You got your very
own hotel room.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.984
It's adjacent to ours,
but it's very private.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.452
I mean, it is called
a peekaboo suite,

16:27.454 --> 16:29.921
so there might be
a little bit of crossover.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.789
NICK: It's everything
you like: it-it's kids,

16:31.791 --> 16:32.790
it's reading.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.792
You are gonna get so
many free bookmarks.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.094
Do I get a per diem?

16:36.096 --> 16:37.962
Yeah. What's that?

16:37.964 --> 16:39.030
All right, doggy door.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.098
Sealed.
Attic.

16:40.100 --> 16:40.999
Padlocked.
Crawlspace.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.533
Uncrawlable.
The cast of<i> Sneakers</i>

16:42.535 --> 16:44.002
couldn't get into
this place.
Uh...

16:44.004 --> 16:45.703
Well, I guess I'm
going to Palm Springs.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.805
I just need your big-ass hat.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.940
The front door.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.975
Bye.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.644
25 points of entry is
too many points of entry!

16:53.646 --> 16:55.213
(door closes)
How? How?!

17:05.058 --> 17:07.959
Wait, wait,
don't tell me.

17:07.961 --> 17:11.062
Agent Isosceles,
part geometry prodigy,

17:11.064 --> 17:13.231
part CIA spy, all
scared of girls.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.465
Wrong.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.401
<i> Cadet</i> Isosceles.
Oh.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.170
It's all right. You know,
it's just, technically,

17:19.172 --> 17:20.838
this is just for myself...

17:20.840 --> 17:21.973
(voice fading)

17:27.847 --> 17:30.014
Wait.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.817
Do you remember when you had to
smuggle the golden sextant

17:32.819 --> 17:34.485
out of the Paris Math Academy?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.854
I do.
I have a mission for you

17:36.856 --> 17:39.090
that is even more sensitive.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.392
(grunting)

17:41.394 --> 17:42.660
All right, this is
the last of it.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.429
Whew! Are you sure
we have to do this?

17:44.431 --> 17:47.031
Babe, we're police officers
who almost missed a shift

17:47.033 --> 17:49.100
because we were busy bouncing.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.002
You're right.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.903
Our capacity for joy
is just way too high.

17:52.906 --> 17:56.107
Okay, so I have
one last secret.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.675
So cute that you keep
calling them secrets.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.043
Just hear me out.

17:59.045 --> 18:02.447
Um, I've lied to every girl
I said "I love you" to.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.550
I mean, I thought I
loved them, but then...

18:05.552 --> 18:09.821
I met you and realized I've
never been in love before.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.924
I did not know that.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.292
Yeah, it was eating
me up inside,

18:14.294 --> 18:16.928
so I called them each
individually and said,

18:16.930 --> 18:18.763
"I never loved you."

18:18.765 --> 18:20.098
Okay. Seems unnecessary.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.400
One of them took
it very badly.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.068
Oh,<i> one</i> of them took it badly?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.204
I mean, she's okay now.
Well, sort... kinda.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.972
She lives at the top
of a very tall tree.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.641
Maybe, like, run stuff
like that by me.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.111
Okay, let me just sign this
right here. Here you go.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.246
My associate asked me
to give this to one of you.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.081
She had to go.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.382
The rest is in the note.

18:38.384 --> 18:41.219
Uh, it says,
"I had to go. Jess."

18:41.221 --> 18:42.520
Did she say any...

18:45.725 --> 18:47.058
What's this book about?

18:47.060 --> 18:49.293
Uh, it's... I mean, it's...

18:49.295 --> 18:51.929
It's hard to exp... Reagan?

18:51.931 --> 18:54.499
Uh...
Reagan, what is it...

18:54.501 --> 18:56.400
Just tell her what it's about.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.570
He wrote this book.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.009
It's about a man with nothing,

19:05.011 --> 19:07.979
risking everything
to feel something.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.148
I'll take it.
Can you sign it?

19:10.150 --> 19:12.583
"Kill yourself." (chuckles)

19:13.319 --> 19:14.652
It's a joke.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.953
It's a reference to...

19:15.955 --> 19:17.822
You'll get it. (chuckles)

19:17.824 --> 19:20.958
Hey, so how's SOCALYCAL...
SOCALYALCON 6?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.360
JESS:
I don't know.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.628
I'm at the airport.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.829
What? Where are you going?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.130
I don't know.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.198
How long you gonna be gone for?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.966
I don't know.
What's two plus two?

19:28.968 --> 19:30.434
Four. I'm listening
to your questions,

19:30.436 --> 19:32.703
I just don't know
the answer to them.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.839
I mean, this isn't like you;
you always say if you had

19:34.841 --> 19:36.874
to choose between planning
a trip or taking a trip,

19:36.876 --> 19:37.942
you'd choose planning.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.010
And I stand by that.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.012
I just, I really need
a change of scenery.

19:41.014 --> 19:44.015
I'm probably just gonna
hang with my dad in Portland.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.216
I did what you said.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.118
I did what was right
for me today.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.986
I just don't know
what's right for me tomorrow.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.656
I do know that
the prices of the tickets

19:51.658 --> 19:53.191
are not going down while we yap.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.526
So I got to go.
I love you. Bye.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.994
(ringtone playing)

19:56.996 --> 19:59.463
Oh, Cece, I'm fine...

20:02.168 --> 20:03.968
I don't know why
you disappeared, Jess,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.070
but you know what,
I'm sure you'll fill me in

20:06.072 --> 20:07.138
back at the hotel.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.373
Also, when I sign a book
"Kill yourself,"

20:09.375 --> 20:11.142
you think they know
that's a reference

20:11.144 --> 20:15.046
to Pepperwood's dilemma
at the fish market, right?

20:15.048 --> 20:18.049
Actually, you know what,
that's a question for Reagan.

20:18.051 --> 20:18.983
Okay, sorry.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.085
See you later, Jess.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.455
Cece, come check this out.

20:26.926 --> 20:27.858
(locks clicking)

20:27.860 --> 20:28.926
What?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.828
Did that, did that just
lock everything?

20:30.830 --> 20:33.431
One touch secures
every point of entry

20:33.433 --> 20:35.166
in the entire house,
bringing us convenience

20:35.168 --> 20:36.434
and real-time
peace of mind.

20:36.436 --> 20:37.768
Okay, can I unlock it?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.170
Well, unlocking it
requires a pass code.

20:39.172 --> 20:42.273
Ours is "my beautiful Cece,"
all one word.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.608
Very sweet.
(phone chimes)

20:43.610 --> 20:45.409
Oh, shoot.
Actually, I screwed up.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.178
Um, it's "my beautiful,
beautiful Cece."

20:47.180 --> 20:49.447
Two "beautifuls."
Okay.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.948
(phone chimes)

20:50.950 --> 20:52.183
(clears throat)

20:52.185 --> 20:54.218
Oh, you know what,
I know what it is.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.953
Great, just put it in.
I'm freezing.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.623
I can't. It only gives you
three tries,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.124
then it locks you out
of the app for 12 hours.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.226
For 12 hours?!
It's fine.
We'll go analog.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.427
Give me your key.

21:03.429 --> 21:06.097
Uh, I'd love to, but
it's on the counter,

21:06.099 --> 21:07.531
next to yours.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.268
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry about a thing.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.936
I promise you,
we'll figure this out.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.271
Override.
(phone chimes)

21:13.273 --> 21:14.438
My beautiful,
beautiful Cece.
(phone chimes)

21:14.440 --> 21:16.641
Override. Override.
Oh, God.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.410
(coughing)

21:19.412 --> 21:20.811
Were you in the chimney?

21:20.813 --> 21:21.912
(hacks) Yes.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.814
The 26th point of entry.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.616
(coughing)
Oh, my God.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.051
Also, we have squirrels.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.719
Aw, I love squirrels.

21:28.721 --> 21:29.987
They're not alive.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.557
I counted...
at least nine of 'em.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.728
<i> Oh, my God. Cece!</i>
<i> (knocking)</i>

21:37.730 --> 21:39.030
<i> My beautiful, beautiful Cece!</i>
