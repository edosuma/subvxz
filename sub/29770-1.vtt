02:34.845 --> 02:36.210

Oh that's right.

02:39.149 --> 02:40.114
How did it go?

02:40.116 --> 02:41.082

If you ever get a new phone

02:42.151 --> 02:43.618
I can text you the video.

02:43.620 --> 02:44.753
Okay smarty pants.

02:44.755 --> 02:45.786
Where's your mom?

02:45.788 --> 02:46.720

02:46.722 --> 02:47.422

02:47.424 --> 02:48.557

- I was talking.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.257
So?

02:49.259 --> 02:50.858
So maybe you should grow up.

02:50.860 --> 02:52.893
So maybe I should tell
Dad about your girlfriend.

02:52.895 --> 02:54.061
You are so stupid.

02:55.632 --> 02:56.630
Oh my god, Mom!

02:56.632 --> 02:57.698
Mom, Penny hit me on the head.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.034
You're just
being such a little dweeb.

02:59.036 --> 03:01.069
I didn't do anything.

03:01.071 --> 03:01.872
Girlfriend?

03:03.039 --> 03:04.873
You apologize to your brother.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.041
Sorry.

03:06.043 --> 03:07.007
And you do the same.

03:07.009 --> 03:08.809
Sorry.

03:08.811 --> 03:09.743
You know we're a family.

03:09.745 --> 03:11.178
We really gotta stick together.

03:11.180 --> 03:12.481
Now why don't you
two go to your rooms

03:12.483 --> 03:13.614
for some quiet time.

03:13.616 --> 03:14.715
Okay?

03:14.717 --> 03:16.586
- I love you.
- I love you too, buddy.

03:17.787 --> 03:19.154
And I love you.

03:19.156 --> 03:21.057
Hey, I love you.

03:23.192 --> 03:23.994
Hey.

03:25.095 --> 03:25.930
Hey.

03:28.966 --> 03:29.901
Oh I got this.

03:31.602 --> 03:32.437
Okay.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.837
What are these?

03:35.839 --> 03:37.706
Oh, where did you get those?

03:37.708 --> 03:39.773
What are they and they
do they have rice in them?

03:39.775 --> 03:40.975
They're nothing.

03:40.977 --> 03:41.976
Can I have them?

03:41.978 --> 03:42.810
No.

03:42.812 --> 03:44.045
But they're fun.

03:44.047 --> 03:45.880
Well they're Mommy's
and you can't have them.

03:45.882 --> 03:46.815
Dang it.

03:46.817 --> 03:47.948
To your room buddy.

03:47.950 --> 03:48.819
Quiet time.

03:51.020 --> 03:51.852
What are those?

03:51.854 --> 03:53.053
I'm getting new boobs.

03:53.055 --> 03:54.189
Really?

03:54.191 --> 03:55.523
You never told me you wanted
me you wanted new boobs.

03:55.525 --> 03:57.091
Do I need to tell you?

03:57.093 --> 03:58.993
The kids ruined mine
and I want new ones.

03:58.995 --> 04:01.095
So why do you have
bags filled with rice?

04:01.097 --> 04:02.297
I'm size testing.

04:02.299 --> 04:03.134
Those are big.

04:04.268 --> 04:06.567
When are you back
from your dad's?

04:06.569 --> 04:07.471
Monday night.

04:08.805 --> 04:10.772
Are you sure you
wanna take your bike?

04:10.774 --> 04:12.006
Yeah, why?

04:12.008 --> 04:14.478
Because last time you went
on a long trip it broke down.

04:16.946 --> 04:19.814
These came from the attorney.

04:19.815 --> 04:23.651
They need to be signed
and back by Thursday.

04:23.653 --> 04:25.255
I will sign them
and get them to you.

04:26.722 --> 04:28.323
Okay.

04:28.325 --> 04:29.727
Oh shit!

04:30.826 --> 04:33.196
I have an interview
on Wednesday.

04:34.564 --> 04:35.931
Can you watch the kids
for a couple hours?

04:35.933 --> 04:36.997
What do you have
an interview for?

04:36.999 --> 04:38.133
Sales.

04:38.135 --> 04:40.100
But you hated sales.

04:40.102 --> 04:42.037
My severance isn't gonna
last forever though, is it?

04:42.039 --> 04:43.705
Well I will watch
them while you go

04:43.707 --> 04:44.806
but you can't forget
things like this,

04:44.808 --> 04:47.578
'cause what if I wasn't
free, what if I was busy?

04:49.145 --> 04:51.078
Don't forget you need
to clean out your shop

04:51.080 --> 04:52.816
from the garage by next Friday.

04:54.150 --> 04:55.083
I know.

04:55.085 --> 04:56.152
I'll do it when I get back.

05:00.056 --> 05:00.891
I'm gonna go.

05:01.893 --> 05:04.859
Will you give your dad
and Miles a hug for me?

05:04.861 --> 05:05.696
Yeah I will.

05:10.100 --> 05:10.934
Okay.

05:12.102 --> 05:12.936

06:26.809 --> 06:28.076
I'm okay.

06:28.078 --> 06:29.110
Come over.

06:29.112 --> 06:30.045
I have the kids.

06:30.047 --> 06:32.379
Oh, right, yeah.

06:32.381 --> 06:34.014
Well how are you
and Grant doing?

06:34.016 --> 06:36.384
Well you're
never gonna believe this

06:36.386 --> 06:38.888
but Grant and I have agreed.

06:40.056 --> 06:42.323
Oh my god, Jenny
are you serious?

06:42.325 --> 06:43.424
Yes.

06:44.794 --> 06:46.062
- Ew.
- So good.

06:47.129 --> 06:48.162
I can return the favor.

06:48.164 --> 06:51.766
Wow, okay.

06:51.768 --> 06:55.069
How, how did you pick someone?

06:55.071 --> 06:57.071
Well, we
just met at a bar.

06:57.073 --> 06:58.739
And that worked for you?

06:58.741 --> 06:59.840
Totally.

06:59.842 --> 07:01.275
You guys should try it.

07:03.179 --> 07:04.347
What was that?

07:05.881 --> 07:06.915
That was nothing.

07:06.917 --> 07:07.751
I'm fine.

07:10.152 --> 07:14.155
I'm really happy that
you guys worked it out.

07:14.157 --> 07:15.122
It's good.

07:15.124 --> 07:17.057
Why don't you come and
see us this weekend?

07:17.059 --> 07:18.359
You haven't been
over for a while.

07:18.361 --> 07:20.061
I know I would like to

07:20.063 --> 07:21.228
but I'm just not sure I
can get away this weekend.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.931
You
deserve to get away.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.965
I know, I do deserve it.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.900
Okay,
well I have to go.

07:26.902 --> 07:27.735
I love you.

07:27.737 --> 07:28.403
Love you too.

07:28.405 --> 07:29.239
Thanks.

08:17.888 --> 08:21.122
Oh, totally busted
you in my campsite.

08:21.124 --> 08:22.357
I'm sorry.

08:22.359 --> 08:24.025
I didn't mean to wake you up.

08:24.027 --> 08:26.460
I was just down by the
lake taking some pictures

08:26.462 --> 08:28.830
and then I got lost
on my way back up.

08:28.832 --> 08:29.467
No problem.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.433
Beautiful bike.

08:33.436 --> 08:35.001
I'm Allison.

08:35.004 --> 08:35.840
Hank.

08:37.273 --> 08:39.274
Well the least I can
do since I woke you up

08:39.275 --> 08:41.241
is offer you a cup of coffee.

08:41.244 --> 08:43.376
Well since you're
offering, sure, yeah.

08:43.379 --> 08:44.279
Great.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.247
I am right over there.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.318
Somewhere over there.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.151
Yes.

08:51.153 --> 08:51.986
Well are you sure?

08:51.988 --> 08:53.121
No, I'm not.

08:53.123 --> 08:54.289
But I hope so.

08:54.291 --> 08:56.056
Alright, well I'll find it.

08:56.058 --> 08:56.891
Great.

08:56.893 --> 08:57.992
I'll see you in a bit.

08:57.994 --> 08:59.196
- Cool, thank you.
- Cool.

09:00.297 --> 09:01.996
Don't get lost.

09:01.998 --> 09:03.400
Getting lost is the fun part.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.141
Hey, bring your bedhead.

09:15.345 --> 09:16.180
Okay, I will.

09:21.317 --> 09:23.218
You guys are gonna
have fun with Nana.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.053
I will see you back on Monday.

09:25.055 --> 09:26.253
Where are you going?

09:26.255 --> 09:29.457
Well I just have to take a
little adventure by myself.

09:29.459 --> 09:30.625
Why?

09:30.627 --> 09:32.093
Because when
people get divorced

09:32.095 --> 09:33.962
they need to find
themselves again.

09:33.964 --> 09:34.896
What?

09:34.898 --> 09:36.296
I read it on the internet.

09:36.298 --> 09:37.133
I love you Mom.

09:38.234 --> 09:39.500
Mwah, I love you.

09:39.502 --> 09:40.337
Grown up.

09:43.105 --> 09:44.271
Bye.

09:44.273 --> 09:46.473
Can I come with you?

09:46.475 --> 09:48.044
Well next time, okay?

09:49.311 --> 09:50.346
Aw.

09:51.214 --> 09:52.349
Do you miss Dadda?

09:53.383 --> 09:54.415
I miss him.

09:54.417 --> 09:55.451
Dad is fun.

09:56.518 --> 09:57.986
I love you.

09:57.988 --> 09:58.823
Bye.

10:10.499 --> 10:13.434
If I have to pick,
I'd say Jamaica.

10:13.436 --> 10:14.468
Alright.

10:14.470 --> 10:15.402
Yeah.

10:15.404 --> 10:16.337
You've really been everywhere.

10:16.339 --> 10:18.072
I love traveling.

10:18.074 --> 10:20.474
It just, you know it gets
a little lonely sometimes

10:20.476 --> 10:21.309
by myself.

10:21.311 --> 10:23.011
But you know but...

10:23.013 --> 10:24.411
Why don't you get
a travel partner?

10:24.413 --> 10:27.314
No, only sometimes, maybe.

10:27.316 --> 10:29.016
But no.

10:29.018 --> 10:29.983
Yeah, the right partner.

10:29.985 --> 10:31.251
The right partner, perhaps.

10:31.253 --> 10:32.520
So what do you do?

10:32.522 --> 10:35.423
Um, right now nothing.

10:35.425 --> 10:38.392
But I'd like to get
back to my old business

10:38.394 --> 10:39.359
one of these days.

10:39.361 --> 10:40.995
Your old business being?

10:40.997 --> 10:44.935
I make, I make
underwear for dogs.

10:46.036 --> 10:46.637
Really?

10:48.470 --> 10:49.503
No.

10:49.505 --> 10:50.704
No not really.

10:51.541 --> 10:52.343
Fuck you.

10:54.109 --> 10:56.010
No I actually, I make
things outta metal.

10:56.012 --> 10:57.945
This is my best seller.

10:57.947 --> 10:58.947
Wow.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.280
That's actually really cool.

11:00.282 --> 11:01.448
Opens beer bottles.

11:01.450 --> 11:03.016
- No way.
- Yeah.

11:03.018 --> 11:04.084
That's cool.

11:04.086 --> 11:05.586
I would definitely buy one.

11:05.588 --> 11:06.457
Well thank you.

11:07.457 --> 11:09.993
But I need more than one
sale to support my kids.

11:11.161 --> 11:12.160
Right.

11:12.162 --> 11:15.729
So, where did you sell them?

11:15.731 --> 11:20.403
An out of date website.

11:23.205 --> 11:25.209
HankMurphysGarage.com.

11:26.176 --> 11:28.008
- Sounds good.
- Bad ass.

11:28.010 --> 11:29.477
I'm keeping this.

11:29.479 --> 11:30.513
It's yours.

11:31.681 --> 11:34.551
Dude, if you really love
this you should get back to it.

11:35.985 --> 11:37.285
You're right.

11:37.287 --> 11:38.586
I always am.

11:38.588 --> 11:41.356
Wow, okay, I'll remember that.

11:41.358 --> 11:42.426
- You should.
- Okay.

11:43.659 --> 11:47.261
So I was thinking of
going swimming later.

11:47.263 --> 11:48.328
Do you wanna come?

11:48.330 --> 11:51.265
Okay, I would love to come.

11:51.267 --> 11:54.168
But, my dad's expecting me.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.371
I should, I should get going.

11:56.373 --> 11:57.441
Okay, your loss.

11:59.308 --> 12:00.143
Ouch.

12:01.378 --> 12:04.545
Well if you wander
and get lost again

12:04.547 --> 12:06.481
you should get
lost in Santa Rosa.

12:06.483 --> 12:08.149
Come by the vineyard.

12:08.151 --> 12:11.419
Aw, I might just do that.

12:11.421 --> 12:12.319
You should.

12:12.321 --> 12:15.490
Well, thank you for
the caffeine fix.

12:15.492 --> 12:16.593
You're very welcome.

12:17.527 --> 12:18.793
I had a really
good time with you.

12:18.795 --> 12:20.261
Me too.

12:20.263 --> 12:22.530
Next time you are coming
swimming with me though.

12:22.532 --> 12:25.433
Okay bossy, I will
come swimming with you.

12:25.435 --> 12:26.467
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:26.469 --> 12:27.769
Well do you need help

12:27.771 --> 12:29.636
- cleaning this mess up?
- No, no no no.

12:29.638 --> 12:30.570
- Go.
- Are you sure?

12:30.572 --> 12:31.772
- I got it.
- Okay.

12:31.774 --> 12:33.407
Don't leave the
butter out too long.

12:33.409 --> 12:34.242
No, never.

12:34.244 --> 12:36.444
Okay, thank you.

12:36.446 --> 12:37.377
Safe travels.

12:37.379 --> 12:38.413
Careful driving that thing.

12:38.415 --> 12:39.313
You too.

12:39.315 --> 12:40.217
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

12:41.718 --> 12:42.750

15:18.740 --> 15:20.143
You ain't got no cell phone?

15:21.643 --> 15:23.477

16:05.555 --> 16:07.354
I'll send one of my
boys to pick it up.

16:07.356 --> 16:08.588
Should I go with him?

16:08.590 --> 16:10.824
Nah, go have a

I'm gonna just buy you
another beer right now.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
I didn't have any of
your burger though.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.644
I did have a fry.

18:09.145 --> 18:10.944
I can't believe I just did that.

18:10.946 --> 18:12.812
Nice one.

18:12.814 --> 18:13.914
What are you doing here?

18:13.916 --> 18:16.149
Well I was on my way to
Jenny's for the weekend.

18:16.151 --> 18:18.918
And I saw your bike
being loaded up.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.888
And the guys at the auto
shop said that you were here.

18:21.890 --> 18:23.390
Where are the kids?

18:23.392 --> 18:24.026
With Nana.

18:25.461 --> 18:27.560
Looks like you
found some company.

18:27.562 --> 18:28.762
What can I get ya?

18:28.764 --> 18:30.897
I would love a little
something something.

18:30.899 --> 18:32.867
And can you get him a beer too?

18:32.869 --> 18:34.033
She drank mine.

18:34.035 --> 18:36.604
Sure, two beers coming up.

18:36.606 --> 18:37.441
Thanks.

18:42.578 --> 18:45.011
So which way are you
going over to your dad's?

18:45.013 --> 18:46.880
Going east to Squaw Bridge.

18:46.882 --> 18:47.883
Oh I love that bridge.

18:48.818 --> 18:49.884
I'm gonna jump off.

18:49.886 --> 18:50.751
What?

18:50.753 --> 18:51.886
Oh that didn't
sound right, did it?

18:51.888 --> 18:52.989
No, it did not.

18:54.724 --> 18:56.624
That bridge is really high.

18:56.626 --> 18:57.857
Yeah, but the
water's really deep.

18:57.859 --> 18:59.663
I've wanted to jump
off since I was a kid.

19:01.030 --> 19:03.830
Why is it so important
that you jump off now?

19:03.832 --> 19:04.898
I don't know, Alex.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.733
Life's short.

19:06.735 --> 19:08.001
I don't wanna be
laying on my death bed,

19:08.003 --> 19:09.603
saying to myself god dammit,

19:09.605 --> 19:11.938
I wish I'd jumped
off that bridge.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.042
You sound like your dad.

19:13.943 --> 19:15.209
Here you go.

19:15.211 --> 19:17.011
Thank you.

19:17.013 --> 19:18.178
And for you sir.

19:18.180 --> 19:20.213
Sorry about that.

19:20.215 --> 19:21.048
Can we get the check?

19:21.050 --> 19:22.450
Yeah sure, of course.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.651
I'll be right back.

19:23.653 --> 19:24.488
Thanks.

19:27.857 --> 19:29.725
I'm going with
you to the bridge.

19:30.892 --> 19:31.727
Why?

19:32.861 --> 19:36.499
Well if you die, then
someone should really be there.

19:52.948 --> 19:54.949
It's a long way down.

19:54.951 --> 19:56.017
I know.

19:56.019 --> 19:58.018
Are you sure
you're in the right spot?

19:58.020 --> 19:59.720
I think so.

19:59.722 --> 20:01.722
And people jump off this
bridge all the time, right?

20:01.724 --> 20:03.590
You're freaking me out Alex.

20:03.592 --> 20:04.494
Jump, you pussy!

20:05.695 --> 20:06.996
Fuck you!

20:08.898 --> 20:09.733
Wow.

20:15.937 --> 20:16.870
Monday morning.

20:16.872 --> 20:17.907
Yeah, some time Monday.

20:18.975 --> 20:20.811
Bike needs a new part.

20:22.078 --> 20:23.213
Won't be here until Monday.

20:24.513 --> 20:25.715
What are you gonna do?

20:27.015 --> 20:28.584
See if my dad can come get me.

20:29.752 --> 20:30.921
You wanna use my phone?

20:31.920 --> 20:33.087
Nah, I'm gonna
finish up in here

20:33.089 --> 20:34.724
and head over to the bar.

20:37.726 --> 20:39.228
Do you want a
ride to your dad's?

20:40.530 --> 20:41.595
That's
totally outta your way.

20:41.597 --> 20:43.062
I'm fine.

20:43.064 --> 20:44.066
Okay.

20:47.069 --> 20:47.870
Alright.

20:51.573 --> 20:52.208
Yeah okay.

20:53.975 --> 20:54.977
Have fun at Jenny's.

20:59.648 --> 21:00.484
Hank.

21:04.719 --> 21:07.089
What else haven't I known
about you all these years?

21:09.292 --> 21:10.723
So you're proposing

21:10.725 --> 21:12.592
that we play a divorced
couples Truth or Dare?

21:12.594 --> 21:14.761
Yeah, if you
wanna call it that.

21:14.763 --> 21:18.732
But each day I pick one
thing and you pick one thing

21:18.734 --> 21:20.803
that we can do or
ask each other.

21:22.138 --> 21:23.069
Like?

21:23.071 --> 21:24.241
Like jump off Squaw Bridge.

21:25.241 --> 21:26.674
Which I didn't do.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.108
Yeah but now the rule
is you can't say no.

21:29.110 --> 21:31.744
What if you pick
something and I don't do it?

21:31.746 --> 21:33.012
Then the game is over
and you're a loser.

21:33.014 --> 21:35.115
Oo I hate losing.

21:35.117 --> 21:36.750
How you guys doing
on those beers?

21:36.752 --> 21:38.051
Oh, we're good.

21:38.053 --> 21:39.353
Can I get you anything else?

21:39.355 --> 21:42.623
Yes, do you have two
pens and a piece of paper?

21:42.625 --> 21:43.226
I do.

21:46.628 --> 21:48.162
Thank you, we will
give these back.

21:48.164 --> 21:49.363
Okay.

21:49.365 --> 21:50.763
Alright.

21:50.765 --> 21:53.000
So if can also be
anything that you always

21:53.002 --> 21:56.604
wanted to do with one another
but maybe never asked.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.071
Like?

21:58.073 --> 22:00.009
Like I don't know, I
mean use your imagination.

22:03.378 --> 22:04.877
Oh don't be creepy.

22:04.879 --> 22:09.349
Just make your choices and fold,

22:09.351 --> 22:11.819
like write on one
side and then fold it

22:11.821 --> 22:13.386
and put your initial on the top.

22:13.388 --> 22:14.320
Two.

22:14.322 --> 22:15.992
Oh thank you Mrs. Alex.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.092
Oo, is that how you
treat your students?

22:19.094 --> 22:20.226
Yeah, when they're really bad.

22:20.228 --> 22:21.297
Are you in or out?

22:27.069 --> 22:28.135
I'm in.

22:28.137 --> 22:28.972
Great.

22:33.743 --> 22:34.578
Okay.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.214
I have a question.

22:41.149 --> 22:43.049
Is it one of your four?

22:43.051 --> 22:43.852
Seriously?

22:46.222 --> 22:48.657
I mean if you want
an honest answer.

22:51.224 --> 22:52.659
Okay, fine.

22:52.661 --> 22:53.796
I'm using my first one.

22:55.430 --> 22:56.632
The game starts now.

22:59.135 --> 23:01.003
Were you really
going to Jenny's?

23:02.405 --> 23:05.675
Huh, first question.

23:13.014 --> 23:13.850
No.

23:20.156 --> 23:21.090
She's so good.

23:22.824 --> 23:24.893
At least we made some
pretty amazing kids.

23:28.196 --> 23:30.963
I guess now we know it's
girlfriends for Penny, huh?

23:30.965 --> 23:32.165
God, I know.

23:32.167 --> 23:33.003
For now.

23:36.472 --> 23:38.871
God, she sure sends
you a lot of emoticons.

23:40.176 --> 23:41.309
I like it.

23:41.311 --> 23:43.413
I think it's her way of
reminding me that she loves me.

23:47.315 --> 23:48.482
Where are we going?

23:48.484 --> 23:49.950
To the city.

23:49.952 --> 23:52.786
I have a friend that's
gonna hook us up.

23:52.788 --> 23:54.253
What does that mean?

23:57.792 --> 23:59.225
That's my dad.

23:59.227 --> 24:00.129
Oh, answer it.

24:03.264 --> 24:04.498
Hey Dad.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.366
Henry,
what are you doing?

24:06.368 --> 24:07.467
I'm in the car with Alex.

24:07.469 --> 24:08.801
You're on speaker phone,

24:08.803 --> 24:11.038
so don't say anything
inappropriate.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.039
Hi Alexandra.

24:12.041 --> 24:13.406
Hi Buck.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.774
My grandkids in there?

24:14.776 --> 24:15.943
No.

24:15.945 --> 24:17.376
You two
getting back together?

24:17.378 --> 24:18.278
Dad!

24:18.280 --> 24:19.812
What do you want?

24:19.814 --> 24:20.880
You still
coming up here?

24:20.882 --> 24:22.382
We are at some point.

24:22.384 --> 24:23.219
We?

24:24.186 --> 24:26.185
Alex is giving me a ride.

24:26.187 --> 24:28.288
Why are you calling her phone?

24:28.290 --> 24:29.790
Well I sort of

24:29.792 --> 24:32.859
got into a car
accident this morning.

24:32.861 --> 24:35.194
How do you sort of
get into a car accident?

24:35.196 --> 24:36.062
Are you okay?

24:36.064 --> 24:37.396
Do you need us to
come pick you up?

24:37.398 --> 24:39.133
No, no no, I'm fine.

24:39.135 --> 24:41.167
I'm in the hospital now in town.

24:41.169 --> 24:43.470
God damn insurance thing.

24:43.472 --> 24:44.838
Don't worry about it.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.339
Miles is coming to get me.

24:46.341 --> 24:47.342
What happened?

24:48.476 --> 24:49.311
Dad?

24:50.780 --> 24:52.346
He hung up.

24:52.348 --> 24:53.183
That's so your dad.

24:56.851 --> 24:57.486
I should go.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.887
Yeah, we should go.

25:37.426 --> 25:38.328
Oh my god.

25:39.494 --> 25:40.327
Let me help you.

25:40.329 --> 25:42.261
Oh Alex, thanks.

25:42.263 --> 25:45.232
Oh what the hell
did you do to your neck, Dad?

25:45.234 --> 25:46.465
It's nothing.

25:46.467 --> 25:48.268
They're just making me
wear this damn thing

25:48.270 --> 25:49.536
so I don't sue 'em.

25:49.538 --> 25:50.971
Well I'm sure if
you're wearing it

25:50.973 --> 25:52.371
it's for a reason.

25:52.373 --> 25:53.373
You ever check in?

25:53.375 --> 25:54.340
Guys.

25:54.342 --> 25:55.509
Hi!

25:55.511 --> 25:57.444
- I thought that was your car.
- Miles!

25:57.446 --> 25:59.178
- What the hell did you do?
- He said you were gorgeous.

25:59.180 --> 26:01.581
Aw, you look great too.

26:01.583 --> 26:02.883
Hey, Hankie.

26:02.885 --> 26:04.217
Oh hey Miles.

26:04.219 --> 26:06.286
Oo, we just got back
from the hospital.

26:06.288 --> 26:07.553
That's great.

26:07.555 --> 26:08.989
Here Dad, put this
behind your back.

26:08.991 --> 26:11.224
Oh no no no no no,
here, look what I got.

26:11.226 --> 26:12.526
I just went by my house.

26:12.528 --> 26:13.961
Here.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.930
This has 15 different
massage settings on it.

26:16.932 --> 26:18.098
Yeah, I think there's an
outlet right back there.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.899
Do you mind plugging that in?

26:19.901 --> 26:21.167
All Shiatsu my friend.

26:21.169 --> 26:22.301
Well thank Miles.

26:22.303 --> 26:24.370
Anything for you Bucko.

26:24.372 --> 26:26.405
And listen, if you need
an extra set of hands

26:26.407 --> 26:27.507
around the vineyard,
anything at all,

26:27.509 --> 26:28.942
you just gimme the word, okay?

26:28.944 --> 26:30.543
I'm fine and I
don't need anything.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.346
So good to see you guys.

26:32.348 --> 26:33.946
You gotta come up
here more often.

26:33.948 --> 26:34.882
I know.

26:34.884 --> 26:35.982
I wish we could.

26:35.984 --> 26:37.117
Alex and I are...

26:37.119 --> 26:38.051
I don't know what I would
do without your old man.

26:38.053 --> 26:40.953
It's so special what
he does with my grapes.

26:40.955 --> 26:41.588
- Ugh.
- Yeah,

26:41.590 --> 26:42.889
the 2014 Syrah.

26:42.891 --> 26:43.656
- Yes.
- Double gold.

26:43.658 --> 26:44.590
Did you hear that?

26:44.592 --> 26:45.992
Yeah!

26:45.994 --> 26:47.261
Anyway I gotta get
back to the fundraiser.

26:47.263 --> 26:48.595
You guys should come
by the pillow fight.

26:48.597 --> 26:50.364
It starts in a few minutes.

26:50.366 --> 26:51.665
Pillow fights?

26:51.667 --> 26:52.499
Yeah.

26:52.501 --> 26:53.302
It's gonna be awesome.

26:54.403 --> 26:55.636
Hey, you can go if you want.

26:55.638 --> 26:57.037
- I think I will.
- I'll stay here with Dad.

26:57.039 --> 26:58.004
Yeah.

26:58.006 --> 26:58.638
Can you enter?

26:58.640 --> 27:00.339
Yeah, $20 donation

27:00.341 --> 27:01.908
and then you get to
challenge somebody.

27:01.910 --> 27:03.345
Great, I challenge you.

27:05.481 --> 27:06.946
Seriously?

27:06.948 --> 27:08.581
Yeah, I'm gonna
use my first one.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.349
On a pillow fight?

27:10.351 --> 27:12.351
I can use it for
whatever I want.

27:12.353 --> 27:13.388
You scared?

27:15.256 --> 27:16.455
No, I'm not.

27:16.457 --> 27:17.390
You're on.

27:17.392 --> 27:19.425
Oh, I wish I could see this.

27:19.427 --> 27:21.094
- Oh sweet.
- Let's do this.

27:21.096 --> 27:22.328
Oh and Matilda's gonna come by

27:22.330 --> 27:23.963
with some food for you
in a little bit, Bucko.

27:23.965 --> 27:25.165
Okay?

27:25.167 --> 27:27.434
Uh Miles, I've told
you time and again

27:27.436 --> 27:30.173
don't call me Bucko or
I'll knock your teeth out.

27:31.307 --> 27:32.505
Well not now because
Alexandra's here

27:32.507 --> 27:34.174
and I got this on.

27:34.176 --> 27:35.242
Sorry.

27:35.244 --> 27:37.176
I just think you're gonna
like her, that's all.

27:37.178 --> 27:38.145
It's my new chef.

27:38.147 --> 27:39.512
She's so amazing.

27:39.514 --> 27:43.482
Oh and I almost forgot
those DVDs from eBay,

27:43.484 --> 27:44.483
they just arrived.

27:45.521 --> 27:46.619
Dad you can't do that.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.387
Sit back and relax, alright?

27:48.389 --> 27:49.588
Yeah.

27:49.590 --> 27:50.523
- Okay.
- Rest up

27:50.525 --> 27:51.524
for Kung Fu night, Bucko.

27:51.526 --> 27:52.492
Hmm, yeah great.

27:52.494 --> 27:53.993
You just, you know what,

27:53.995 --> 27:55.963
why don't you all
leave me alone?

27:55.965 --> 27:57.364
- Just get on outta here.
- Gees, grumpy.

27:57.366 --> 27:58.397
Skate on outta here.

27:58.399 --> 27:59.433
See you later Grumpus.

27:59.435 --> 28:01.367
So long grump.

28:01.369 --> 28:02.205
Pull a pump up.

28:03.738 --> 28:05.274
It's good to see you two.

28:07.443 --> 28:08.375
Together.

28:21.523 --> 28:24.257
The wagon broke down
somewhere outta town.

28:24.259 --> 28:25.459
I think so, yeah.

28:25.461 --> 28:27.360
Have you tried
the Samurai red yet?

28:27.362 --> 28:28.729
No I haven't, but I will.

28:28.731 --> 28:29.695
It's fabulous.

28:29.697 --> 28:30.696
I'm sure it is, Miles.

28:30.698 --> 28:32.732
All thanks to your dad.

28:38.573 --> 28:39.606
Miles.

28:39.608 --> 28:40.976
- Hi.
- There you are.

28:42.444 --> 28:45.444
When are we doing
the pillow fights?

28:45.446 --> 28:46.279
I'm challenging you.

28:46.281 --> 28:47.513
Oh that's terrific.

28:47.515 --> 28:48.647
This is Hank and Alex.

28:48.649 --> 28:50.349
These are my friends.

28:50.351 --> 28:52.118
This is Pepper and she just
works here at the winery.

28:52.120 --> 28:52.786
Okay, cool.

28:52.788 --> 28:54.488
Hey, what's up Hank?

28:54.490 --> 28:55.321
How's it going?

28:55.323 --> 28:56.158
Alex.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.492
Are we having an after
party here tonight?

28:59.494 --> 29:01.595
No, no, no we're not.

29:01.597 --> 29:03.129
Where are the pillows?

29:03.131 --> 29:05.031
They're in my car.

29:05.033 --> 29:05.632
Come with me.

29:05.634 --> 29:06.465
I can't.

29:06.467 --> 29:07.733
I actually, I have to,

29:07.735 --> 29:09.403
thanks so much.

29:09.405 --> 29:12.438
Sign up Alex, here for
the fundraiser et cetera.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.540
Hank are you available?

29:13.542 --> 29:15.442
Uh, sure.

29:15.444 --> 29:17.144
- Yeah.
- Terrific,

29:17.146 --> 29:19.581
'cause Alex and I actually, we
really need some alone time.

29:21.116 --> 29:23.116
Okay.

29:23.118 --> 29:23.783
Alone time, okay.

29:23.785 --> 29:25.184
Come on stud.

29:25.186 --> 29:26.121
Yeah, let's go.

29:27.589 --> 29:30.190
God I gotta come up with
an excuse for firing her.

29:30.192 --> 29:31.625
She cannot take a hint.

29:31.627 --> 29:33.359
I'm sorry for using
you like that.

29:33.361 --> 29:34.761
Oh no, I don't mind.

29:34.763 --> 29:35.694
Ugh.

29:35.696 --> 29:37.630
I hope Hank doesn't mind either.

29:37.632 --> 29:39.101
Yeah, he doesn't care.

29:40.301 --> 29:42.668
You know we're not
together anymore.

29:42.670 --> 29:43.505
Really, what?

29:44.807 --> 29:47.441
We're signing divorce
papers next week.

29:47.443 --> 29:48.642
Oh my god, what happened?

29:48.644 --> 29:49.608
Hank had an affair.

29:49.610 --> 29:51.511
- No.
- Yeah.

29:51.513 --> 29:54.146
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

29:54.148 --> 29:57.219
Well, we had other
issues, trust me.

29:58.486 --> 30:00.820
I mean if it wasn't him it
probably would've been me.

30:00.822 --> 30:02.492
Jesus, I'm sorry.

30:05.660 --> 30:06.793
What are you doing
here together then?

30:06.795 --> 30:10.262
That's a great question
with a complicated answer.

30:10.264 --> 30:11.164
Yeah?

30:11.166 --> 30:13.500
I, I need a drink.

30:13.502 --> 30:14.568
Let's go over here.

30:14.570 --> 30:17.537
♪ The leaves are green black ♪

30:17.539 --> 30:18.672
He's
been with that girl

30:18.674 --> 30:20.173
the last couple of hours.

30:20.175 --> 30:21.174
Hasn't he?

30:21.176 --> 30:22.108
- Alex?
- Yeah.

30:22.110 --> 30:22.809
Whoa, you alright?

30:22.811 --> 30:24.344
- Yeah.
- No, she's...

30:24.346 --> 30:26.113
I knew it.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.548
Are you and Miles dating?

30:28.550 --> 30:29.515
Is that what's going on?

30:29.517 --> 30:30.817
No.

30:30.819 --> 30:34.654
It's that he's so into
that girl that he's with.

30:34.656 --> 30:36.356
Really, you think so?

30:36.358 --> 30:38.628
Yeah, it's obvious they're
both so into each other.

30:40.161 --> 30:40.763
No.

30:44.265 --> 30:45.432
There's no way.

30:45.434 --> 30:46.234
Yes.

30:49.871 --> 30:50.703
Drink.

30:50.705 --> 30:52.405
Uh no, I'm good.

30:52.407 --> 30:53.775
I'm good, thank you.

30:55.409 --> 30:56.478
Are you okay?

30:59.580 --> 31:00.780
Are you alright?

31:00.782 --> 31:02.249
Huh?

31:02.251 --> 31:03.817
Ugh, oh okay.

31:03.819 --> 31:05.452
Alright.

31:05.454 --> 31:06.685
Ah yeah.

31:06.687 --> 31:08.421
You're gonna be okay.

31:08.423 --> 31:09.692
Um hmm, I know.

31:10.658 --> 31:11.758
Is he watching?

31:11.760 --> 31:12.662
Is who watching?

31:19.267 --> 31:21.334
Oh god!

31:21.336 --> 31:22.505
What the hell?

31:23.605 --> 31:24.703
Ugh.

31:24.705 --> 31:25.638
That's disgusting.

31:25.640 --> 31:26.839
That was gross.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.276
You puked in my mouth!

31:29.278 --> 31:30.113
Ugh.

31:31.213 --> 31:32.678
I'm going back.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.116
Don't tell Miles.

31:39.588 --> 31:40.619
Who is it?

31:40.621 --> 31:42.388
I'm Matilda.

31:42.390 --> 31:43.825
I brought you something to eat.

31:48.463 --> 31:49.328
Just a sec.

31:49.330 --> 31:50.398
God dammit.

31:51.667 --> 31:52.667
Ow.

31:56.737 --> 31:58.373
Oh Jesus Christ.

31:59.907 --> 32:00.909
Okay, come in.

32:06.380 --> 32:07.880
Oh.

32:07.882 --> 32:09.549
I can't reach my clothes.

32:09.551 --> 32:10.386
I'm...

32:18.392 --> 32:19.227
Thank you.

32:20.896 --> 32:22.231
Do you need clothes?

32:23.298 --> 32:23.900
Honestly?

32:24.900 --> 32:28.704
No, I actually prefer
to be in my underwear.

32:30.272 --> 32:30.907
Okay.

32:33.442 --> 32:34.510
Oh that looks good.

32:37.646 --> 32:38.478
Ow!

32:38.480 --> 32:39.315
Damn.

32:40.282 --> 32:42.685
I'll help you
if you put clothes on.

32:43.651 --> 32:44.452
Okay, fine.

32:54.896 --> 32:56.963
Hey, here.

32:56.965 --> 32:57.766
Nevermind.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.934
I mean if you wanna
try it, I'm here for you.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.907
I mean I'll even try
to stay outta your way.

33:05.873 --> 33:06.740
I don't know.

33:06.742 --> 33:08.274
No, whatever you need.

33:08.276 --> 33:08.907
Seriously.

33:08.909 --> 33:10.342
A shoulder to cry on.

33:10.344 --> 33:13.582
Look here, a lid to
keep the sun away

33:14.483 --> 33:16.415
from your fair beautiful skin.

33:16.417 --> 33:17.349
- Thank you.
- Looks like

33:17.351 --> 33:18.885
you guys are having a good time.

33:18.887 --> 33:20.587
We are.

33:20.589 --> 33:22.692
Oh, thank you for
getting those pillows.

33:24.693 --> 33:25.759
We're fighting first.

33:25.761 --> 33:26.596
Good.

33:27.696 --> 33:29.328
That's good.

33:29.330 --> 33:31.063
Miles is doing some really
cool stuff these days.

33:31.065 --> 33:32.799
Oh is he?

33:32.801 --> 33:33.633
That's so great.

33:33.635 --> 33:34.567
How is Pepper?

33:34.569 --> 33:37.002
Oh she's so funny, hilarious.

33:37.004 --> 33:40.607
Hey, everybody
come over here.

33:40.609 --> 33:43.812
I've got a microphone
and some words for you.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.813
Miles is doing such good
things for schools these days.

33:47.815 --> 33:48.982
Oh yeah?

33:48.984 --> 33:50.849
God that's so great.

33:50.851 --> 33:53.052
He's looking really good too.

33:56.992 --> 33:59.759
Hello everybody, thank
you so much for coming out.

33:59.761 --> 34:03.762
Friends, Sonomans,
strangers on my property.

34:03.764 --> 34:05.098
I wanna thank you
all for coming out

34:05.100 --> 34:07.666
for this wonderful cause today.

34:07.668 --> 34:09.335
Your local schools.

34:09.337 --> 34:11.603
Give yourselves a huge
round of applause.

34:11.605 --> 34:12.971
Thank you so much
for being here.

34:16.777 --> 34:18.811
And now our first friends up.

34:18.813 --> 34:20.746
We have Hank and Alex.

34:20.748 --> 34:22.382
Alex, guys, choose your pillows.

34:22.384 --> 34:23.717
Choose them wisely.

34:23.719 --> 34:25.719
Here are the rules, folks.

34:25.721 --> 34:28.822
Three knock downs
is a knock out.

34:28.824 --> 34:29.755
You got it?

34:29.757 --> 34:31.358
You can only use your pillows.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.393
You cannot punch,
you cannot kick,

34:33.395 --> 34:36.096
you cannot scratch,
you cannot shove.

34:36.098 --> 34:40.099
If you break these rules you're
automatically disqualified.

34:40.101 --> 34:42.772
Folks, let's let
these games begin.

34:44.906 --> 34:46.373
You have fun in
the parking lot?

34:46.375 --> 34:48.875
Just as much fun as
you had with Miles.

34:48.877 --> 34:51.911
Good, 'cause you can
do whatever you want

34:51.913 --> 34:52.878
with whoever you want.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.447
Good, then you won't
care that she kissed me.

34:54.449 --> 34:55.849
Get her Hank!

34:55.851 --> 34:57.449
Destroy her for me.

34:59.554 --> 35:00.956
The boy goes down.

35:02.156 --> 35:03.489
Wow.

35:03.491 --> 35:06.893
It looks like we have an
incredibly powerful contender here.

35:06.895 --> 35:09.596
There's a lotta story
here to this fight.

35:09.598 --> 35:10.864
And he's back up.

35:10.866 --> 35:12.467
Folks, what's gonna happen next?

35:14.735 --> 35:15.735
I hate you!

35:15.737 --> 35:17.807
Then it's a good thing
we're getting divorced.

35:21.676 --> 35:23.578
Oh that's not okay.

35:28.516 --> 35:30.683
Oh hey, hey hey!

35:30.685 --> 35:33.052
That's what I was talk.

35:33.054 --> 35:37.791
I'm afraid folks that we have
an automatic disqualification

35:37.793 --> 35:40.994
for my friend Alex Murphy.

35:40.996 --> 35:42.462
It's not Murphy.

35:42.464 --> 35:43.532
It's Jackson!

35:56.011 --> 35:57.846
How was the pillow fight?

35:59.815 --> 36:00.913
That bad, huh?

36:00.915 --> 36:02.014
Here.

36:02.016 --> 36:03.049
Try some of this.

36:03.051 --> 36:04.116
It's yum.

36:04.118 --> 36:05.784
Fountain Grove Appalachian.

36:05.786 --> 36:06.985
I don't feel
like drinking wine.

36:06.987 --> 36:07.920
Just try it.

36:07.922 --> 36:09.090
I wanna know what you think.

36:18.467 --> 36:19.969
Jesus Christ Dad.

36:21.703 --> 36:22.634
Relax.

36:22.636 --> 36:23.538
It's for the pain.

36:24.505 --> 36:26.806
Didn't the hospital
give you pain pills?

36:26.808 --> 36:27.810
This works better.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.244
Where do you get weed?

36:31.246 --> 36:32.811
Miles.

36:32.813 --> 36:34.047
How's the wine?

36:34.049 --> 36:35.282
'Course you got
weed from Miles.

36:35.284 --> 36:37.884
What, did he buy a weed farm
for cancer patients somewhere?

36:37.886 --> 36:38.817
What?

36:38.819 --> 36:39.921
What's wrong with you?

36:40.822 --> 36:42.057
Where's Alexandra?

36:43.058 --> 36:44.760
Don't know and don't care.

36:47.094 --> 36:49.195
By the way that's some
damn good wine, Dad.

36:49.197 --> 36:50.032
I know.

36:53.835 --> 36:55.902
Do you like this one?

36:55.904 --> 36:58.040
It's a little, like sweet.

36:59.139 --> 37:02.007
Which was unexpected
for this kind.

37:02.009 --> 37:02.911
Hello Hank.

37:03.911 --> 37:05.043
Can we talk?

37:05.045 --> 37:06.645
Talk.

37:06.647 --> 37:07.749
Can we talk outside?

37:09.250 --> 37:10.084
Fine.

37:16.023 --> 37:18.090
Hey, did you give my dad weed?

37:18.092 --> 37:18.958
Nirvana.

37:18.960 --> 37:20.125
- What?
- Nirvana,

37:20.127 --> 37:21.594
that's the name of the weed.

37:21.596 --> 37:24.163
It's good for pain
and sleeplessness.

37:24.165 --> 37:25.532
Oh wow, that
sounds really good.

37:25.534 --> 37:26.965
Yeah it is, would
you like some?

37:26.967 --> 37:27.969
- No.
- Okay.

37:43.717 --> 37:45.684
Why are you even here?

37:45.686 --> 37:47.022
I don't know why I'm here.

37:48.022 --> 37:49.725
Maybe I should leave tomorrow.

37:52.226 --> 37:53.661
I don't want you to leave.

37:55.063 --> 37:55.898
I was just,

37:57.699 --> 37:59.831
I was just jealous
of you and Miles.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.803
Is that why you
kissed slutty McGhee?

38:04.139 --> 38:05.804
I didn't kiss her.

38:05.806 --> 38:08.241
She molested me in the parking
lot and puked in my mouth.

38:08.243 --> 38:09.277
That chick is insane.

38:11.779 --> 38:13.313
That's gross.

38:13.315 --> 38:15.148
It is gross.

38:15.150 --> 38:17.083
Is that why you
kicked my ass today?

38:17.085 --> 38:19.152
Yeah, I'm sorry.

38:19.154 --> 38:21.690
Just, the past came back
to me with that chick.

38:23.058 --> 38:24.891
So you're really
jealous of Miles?

38:24.893 --> 38:26.960
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

38:26.962 --> 38:29.962
You, he's paying all
this attention to you

38:29.964 --> 38:33.032
and he's doing fundraisers
for school kids.

38:33.034 --> 38:35.168
And he's rich

38:35.170 --> 38:38.003
and he's giving my dad
Shiatsu massage pillows.

38:38.005 --> 38:40.139
Seriously, Hank.

38:40.141 --> 38:42.775
This isn't easy for
me to admit, you know.

38:42.777 --> 38:43.979
I don't even have a job.

38:44.946 --> 38:46.311
I know it isn't easy for you.

38:46.313 --> 38:48.947
But, it's good that
you're talking about it.

38:48.949 --> 38:51.553
I'm glad that you're
talking about it.

38:53.922 --> 38:55.925
Can we keep playing
the game tomorrow?

38:58.092 --> 39:00.058
You sure that's
such a good idea?

39:00.060 --> 39:01.828
You backing out?

39:01.830 --> 39:03.329
I am not!

39:03.331 --> 39:04.730
Am I interrupting?

39:04.732 --> 39:05.398
- No.
- Good.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.199
- No you're not.
- Good.

39:07.201 --> 39:09.604
I found those pills that
we discussed earlier.

39:11.038 --> 39:12.105
What's that?

39:12.107 --> 39:14.340
Molly, round two tomorrow.

39:14.342 --> 39:16.742
Yeah, Alex told me all
about what you guys are doing.

39:16.744 --> 39:19.078
I just think it's so bold
and it sounds like good fun.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.012
- I'd really like...
- What the hell

39:20.014 --> 39:21.215
haven't you guys talked about?

39:22.717 --> 39:24.083
Oh.

39:24.085 --> 39:25.317
I'm sorry.

39:25.319 --> 39:26.251
I'm gonna go pour
some more wine.

39:26.253 --> 39:28.154
Maybe put on a few tunes.

39:28.156 --> 39:29.721
- Alright.
- Sounds great.

39:36.797 --> 39:39.965
I caught my dad smoking
weed today out of a bong.

39:41.703 --> 39:42.338
It's not funny.

39:44.172 --> 39:45.874
It's definitely funny.

39:59.688 --> 40:00.853
Coffee?

40:00.855 --> 40:01.790
Oh my god, yes.

40:13.101 --> 40:15.333
Um, that's good.

40:15.335 --> 40:16.469
Um hmm.

40:16.471 --> 40:17.869
And these our papers?

40:17.871 --> 40:18.938
Um hmm.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.040
Are you still up for
the magic pill pick today?

40:21.042 --> 40:22.741
Yes I am.

40:22.743 --> 40:24.212
Okay, here goes.

40:25.279 --> 40:26.114
Alright.

40:33.221 --> 40:35.123
Oh Hank, seriously?

40:40.194 --> 40:42.295
Ha, your rules.

40:42.297 --> 40:43.996
I hated that job
in high school.

40:43.998 --> 40:46.165
Well that's why I never asked.

40:46.167 --> 40:47.967
This is really your fantasy.

40:47.969 --> 40:49.268
You have no idea

40:49.270 --> 40:51.471
what that outfit did
for me as a teenager.

40:51.473 --> 40:54.239
What outfit,
what magic pills?

40:55.275 --> 40:56.310
Those my Pop-Tarts?

40:57.779 --> 40:59.311
- Yeah.
- Will you make me one?

40:59.313 --> 41:01.047
Um hmm.

41:01.049 --> 41:03.882
I'm gonna go shower
so I can go into town

41:03.884 --> 41:06.421
and mug some poor
girl after her shift.

41:07.322 --> 41:08.755
Oh do you think you can handle

41:08.757 --> 41:09.922
finding us a place
to stay tonight?

41:09.924 --> 41:11.389
I'm already on it.

41:11.391 --> 41:12.358
Wow.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.763
Gees, don't seem so shocked.

41:23.170 --> 41:25.137
- Yeah.
- There you go.

41:25.139 --> 41:25.973
Um hmm.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.308
Ah.

41:29.310 --> 41:33.813
Uh, what's going on
between you and Alexandra?

41:33.815 --> 41:35.148
What do you mean?

41:35.150 --> 41:37.382
Well most people
about to get divorced

41:37.384 --> 41:39.821
don't do the things you
two seem to be doing.

41:41.255 --> 41:43.288
I don't know, it's
complicated Dad.

41:43.290 --> 41:45.558
Probably like you and Mom were.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.360
No.

41:47.362 --> 41:48.897
That wasn't complicated.

41:49.964 --> 41:51.132
I just fucked it up.

41:53.134 --> 41:54.902
I regretted it ever since, too.

41:58.873 --> 42:01.474
Mind if Alex and I
go somewhere tonight?

42:01.476 --> 42:02.808
No no, no problem.

42:02.810 --> 42:04.277
It's Kung Fu night.

42:06.581 --> 42:08.014
I used to ask you

42:08.016 --> 42:09.949
to watch Kung Fu movies
with me all the time.

42:09.951 --> 42:11.317
Did I?

42:11.319 --> 42:13.788
No, but you like
watching it with Miles now.

42:15.223 --> 42:16.257
Oh.

42:18.259 --> 42:22.195
Henry, Miles is
just this lonely kid

42:22.197 --> 42:23.532
trying to figure it all out.

42:24.766 --> 42:28.403
I mean he's got lots of money
now because of what happened

42:29.503 --> 42:32.103
and I'm sure not a day goes by

42:32.105 --> 42:33.905
where he doesn't
wish he had his dad

42:33.907 --> 42:36.277
or the rest of his family
with him instead of me.

42:38.378 --> 42:40.516
Now can I have my Pop-Tarts?

42:43.284 --> 42:46.251
Hmm, num num.

42:46.253 --> 42:50.355
Oh and would you go and get
my clothes from the bedroom?

42:50.357 --> 42:51.623
Really?

42:51.625 --> 42:53.861
I'm taking Matilda out
to the vineyard today.

43:03.638 --> 43:04.570
Okay.

43:04.572 --> 43:06.137
You can open your eyes now.

43:06.139 --> 43:08.007
- What?
- Check it out.

43:08.009 --> 43:08.844
No!

43:12.013 --> 43:13.179
- Oh!
- Yes.

43:13.181 --> 43:14.179
Yes!

43:14.181 --> 43:15.146
Uh huh.

43:15.148 --> 43:16.382
Well done.

43:16.384 --> 43:17.315
I hear
there's a tree net

43:17.317 --> 43:18.116
on the property somewhere too.

43:18.118 --> 43:18.918
Seriously?

43:18.920 --> 43:20.319
That's excellent.

43:20.321 --> 43:22.456
Woo, watch your head.

43:25.460 --> 43:27.295
Whoa, this place is badass.

43:28.596 --> 43:29.598
- Yes.
- Yes!

43:32.433 --> 43:33.366
This tiny little stove.

43:33.368 --> 43:34.235
That is a loft.

43:36.304 --> 43:38.337
Beers in the fridge.

43:38.339 --> 43:39.572
Oh, there's
an outdoor shower.

43:39.574 --> 43:40.876
Deck, whoa.

43:45.013 --> 43:47.445
We're in a tree, we're
staying in a tree tonight.

43:47.447 --> 43:48.447
We're staying in a tree.

43:48.449 --> 43:49.482
- That's right.
- That's right.

43:49.484 --> 43:50.181
Let's get a beer.

43:50.183 --> 43:50.985
No prob.

43:53.186 --> 43:53.788
Thanks.

43:56.991 --> 43:58.393
Let's go find this tree net.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.395
Let's do it.

44:02.297 --> 44:03.130
Pills?

44:08.368 --> 44:11.472
You sure you wanna
do this with me?

44:16.576 --> 44:20.181
Are you sure you
wanna do this with me?

44:34.295 --> 44:35.328
That looks
so goody on you.

44:35.330 --> 44:36.362
Thank you.

44:36.364 --> 44:37.563
That's an amazing flower.

44:37.565 --> 44:39.534
I think it's super beautiful.

44:45.505 --> 44:47.475
You know what I always
hated about you?

44:48.409 --> 44:49.976
What?

44:49.978 --> 44:52.481
You always shut
me out when you were mad.

44:53.480 --> 44:54.282
I know.

44:56.650 --> 44:58.451
You know what I always
hated about you?

44:58.453 --> 44:59.087
What?

45:00.487 --> 45:01.686
It's that you never trusted me

45:01.688 --> 45:03.521
to make a decision on my own.

45:03.523 --> 45:04.456
I'm sorry.

45:04.458 --> 45:06.525
I know, I'm sorry.

45:06.527 --> 45:07.561
Me too.

45:10.665 --> 45:11.500
Me too.

45:14.634 --> 45:16.569
I always hated
all the mess piles

45:16.571 --> 45:18.003
you left around the house.

45:24.779 --> 45:25.681
You wanna kiss me?

45:28.482 --> 45:29.517
Yes.

45:30.485 --> 45:31.320
I do.

45:34.589 --> 45:36.021
That's Penny.

45:36.023 --> 45:36.657
Penny?

45:40.293 --> 45:41.326
Hi Mom!

45:41.328 --> 45:43.029
Oh hi sweeties.

45:43.031 --> 45:44.362
Hey, hey kids.

45:44.364 --> 45:45.431
Oh hey Dad.

45:45.433 --> 45:46.732
What are you guys
doing together?

45:46.734 --> 45:48.433
We are on a tree net.

45:48.435 --> 45:50.338
Here, this is the ground.

45:52.706 --> 45:54.475
Whoa, that's awesome.

45:55.476 --> 45:57.446
Wow, you're really high.

45:58.645 --> 45:59.578
What's so funny?

45:59.580 --> 46:00.579
You guys are acting kinda weird.

46:00.581 --> 46:01.780
Nothing sweetheart.

46:01.782 --> 46:04.516
Your brother's right,
we're really high.

46:04.518 --> 46:05.550
In the trees.

46:05.552 --> 46:07.353
Yep, in the trees.

46:07.355 --> 46:09.188
What's going on?

46:09.190 --> 46:10.556
Are you with Hank?

46:10.558 --> 46:11.724
- Oh, hey Nana!
- Hi.

46:11.726 --> 46:13.826
I can't see you
anymore, it's frozen.

46:13.828 --> 46:15.360
Oh I can see you just fine.

46:15.362 --> 46:17.431
Bye Mom, love you kids.

46:20.701 --> 46:25.706
I can't believe we just
talked to our kids online.

46:27.308 --> 46:29.143
We're horrible parents.

46:30.478 --> 46:31.646
So horrible.

46:33.614 --> 46:35.681
I wanna remember this moment.

46:35.683 --> 46:36.849
I'm gonna take a picture.

46:36.851 --> 46:38.053
Um pictures.

46:38.752 --> 46:40.186
You want me to do it?

46:40.188 --> 46:42.387
Okay, you take some.

46:42.389 --> 46:43.225

46:59.639 --> 47:01.706
I like them so much, I
wrote a song about them.

47:01.708 --> 47:02.543

47:05.145 --> 47:07.246
Wrote it a long time ago.

47:07.248 --> 47:08.380
Just never told you.

47:09.317 --> 47:10.685
You are full of it.

47:11.853 --> 47:14.853
You never wrote a
song about my boobs.

47:14.855 --> 47:16.157

Well sing it.

47:20.261 --> 47:21.096

47:22.830 --> 47:25.764
Wrote this when I was
going through my R&B phase.

47:27.134 --> 47:28.766
You never went
through an R&B phase.

48:23.657 --> 48:25.360
Touch the other one.

48:26.694 --> 48:27.728
Okay.

48:31.732 --> 48:32.697
I wanna feel your skin.

48:32.699 --> 48:33.734
Um hmm.

48:45.279 --> 48:47.282
I'm ready to do yours.

48:51.953 --> 48:52.853
Let's go.

48:56.656 --> 48:57.792
Are you ready?

48:58.659 --> 48:59.661
Yes.

49:03.264 --> 49:05.496
Is this what you wanted?

49:05.498 --> 49:06.767
You look so hot.

49:12.706 --> 49:16.942
Just like the girl
who meets the landlady.

49:16.944 --> 49:17.779
Oh yeah.

49:24.685 --> 49:25.686
Come here.

49:55.715 --> 49:57.819
Oh gimme that corn dog.

50:04.659 --> 50:07.229
Did you really just say that?

50:33.520 --> 50:34.987
Oh god, right there.

50:34.989 --> 50:35.790
Yeah.

51:37.717 --> 51:38.851
Hey.

51:38.853 --> 51:40.619
I forgot to tell you

51:40.621 --> 51:43.154
but I think my dad has
a crush on Matilda.

51:43.156 --> 51:44.857
That's very cute.

51:44.859 --> 51:45.891
Isn't it?

51:45.893 --> 51:46.858
Hello.

51:46.860 --> 51:48.529
- Oh.
- Good morning.

51:55.703 --> 51:56.337
Um.

51:58.438 --> 51:59.973
I had fun with you yesterday.

52:00.808 --> 52:01.842
I did too.

52:07.415 --> 52:08.049
You first.

52:17.590 --> 52:19.891
You're finally trusting me.

52:19.893 --> 52:22.363
- Oh that one.
- I'm excited.

52:23.531 --> 52:24.862
I can't believe I'm
finally letting you.

52:24.864 --> 52:25.730
Why?

52:25.732 --> 52:26.935
Mine's not a forest
and you like it.

52:28.701 --> 52:29.837
Alright, fair enough.

52:31.205 --> 52:32.139
Fair enough.

52:41.882 --> 52:42.917
Since when?

52:45.786 --> 52:46.588
A long time.

52:48.522 --> 52:49.857
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

52:51.058 --> 52:52.891
We haven't been
the most open couple

52:52.893 --> 52:53.927
in the past few years.

52:56.630 --> 52:57.499
Wow.

52:58.199 --> 52:59.032
A three way.

53:02.469 --> 53:03.103
Whew.

53:03.971 --> 53:05.938
Should we do mine first?

53:06.940 --> 53:07.942
I think we should.

53:08.942 --> 53:10.645
Probably a good idea.

53:12.480 --> 53:13.078
Alright.

53:13.080 --> 53:13.915
Cheers to a good day.

53:17.051 --> 53:18.717
Alright, you're gonna
be careful, right?

53:18.719 --> 53:21.018
Is that the new
Gillette ball shaver?

53:21.956 --> 53:23.889
Don't laugh.

53:23.891 --> 53:25.958
This is an extremely
delicate procedure

53:25.960 --> 53:26.961
you're about to perform.

53:28.496 --> 53:29.962
Okay that's a lotta
shaving cream.

53:29.964 --> 53:32.598
Oh yeah, okay.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.998
That sounds right.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.035
Ah.

53:37.670 --> 53:38.603
Ready?

53:38.605 --> 53:41.074
Shit, yes okay, go.

53:42.009 --> 53:45.143
Um hmm.

53:45.145 --> 53:47.081
Ah, whew.

53:51.951 --> 53:55.186
You know if you mow the
lawn around a mailbox,

53:55.188 --> 53:57.556
the mailbox looks much bigger.

53:57.558 --> 53:59.127
The mailbox is
plenty big, okay?

54:00.828 --> 54:01.663
Ah!

54:03.864 --> 54:05.697
I'm gonna need
you to hold 'em up

54:05.699 --> 54:06.965
and stretch 'em out.

54:06.967 --> 54:09.037
Ah, hold 'em and
stretch 'em, okay.

54:10.036 --> 54:11.235
Here we go.

54:15.942 --> 54:17.576
So how are we gonna
pick the girl?

54:17.578 --> 54:18.976
Ow!

54:18.978 --> 54:19.880
What girl?

54:21.581 --> 54:23.083
The girl for the three way.

54:24.317 --> 54:26.186
I never said anything
about there being a girl.

54:28.721 --> 54:30.021
No fucking way.

54:30.023 --> 54:32.123
You have to.

54:32.125 --> 54:33.291
I do not.

54:33.293 --> 54:34.692
Really?

54:34.694 --> 54:36.697
Do remember your teenage
fantasy last night?

54:37.797 --> 54:38.864
That's totally different.

54:38.866 --> 54:40.032
How is that different?

54:40.034 --> 54:41.833
Ouch!

54:41.835 --> 54:42.971
God dammit.

54:45.105 --> 54:46.337
A guy?

54:46.339 --> 54:47.271
You know what,
you weren't upset

54:47.273 --> 54:49.141
when you thought it was a girl.

54:49.143 --> 54:49.974
Ow!

54:49.976 --> 54:51.710
Shit.

54:51.712 --> 54:52.643
It's just a little knick.

54:52.645 --> 54:53.814
You'll be fine.

54:57.051 --> 54:59.020
Have you always
wanted two dudes?

55:00.253 --> 55:00.888
I have.

55:04.592 --> 55:06.291
Okay, you know what, I'm done.

55:06.293 --> 55:07.224
I'm done.

55:07.226 --> 55:08.659
Okay you need to lie down

55:08.661 --> 55:10.063
because it looks like a
train wreck down here.

55:11.699 --> 55:12.534
Oh god.

55:17.170 --> 55:18.005
Okay.

55:19.172 --> 55:20.607
Say I do do this.

55:22.076 --> 55:23.641
How's it gonna work?

55:23.643 --> 55:24.308
Anything goes.

55:24.310 --> 55:26.612
No, no no no no.

55:26.614 --> 55:28.112
We need rules.

55:28.114 --> 55:29.947
Ah that tickles.

55:29.949 --> 55:30.882
That tickles.

55:30.884 --> 55:31.686
Okay.

55:32.886 --> 55:36.121
Unlike you, I haven't been
with anyone else in 16 years.

55:36.123 --> 55:39.090
And I'm giving you the
opportunity to be there when I do.

55:39.092 --> 55:40.094
You take it or leave it.

55:49.168 --> 55:50.701
Okay.

55:50.703 --> 55:52.103
Fine.

55:52.105 --> 55:53.005
Good luck finding a dude

55:53.007 --> 55:54.239
that's gonna be into
that sorta thing.

55:54.241 --> 55:55.741
Miles is into it.

55:55.743 --> 55:56.677
Miles!

55:57.877 --> 55:58.744
You're joking, right?

55:58.746 --> 55:59.945
You're fucking with me.

55:59.947 --> 56:01.715
Yes, I will be
fucking both of you.

56:07.855 --> 56:09.186
Okay.

56:09.188 --> 56:10.223
You're done.

56:23.936 --> 56:24.772
Hey...

56:30.177 --> 56:31.677
God dammit.

56:31.679 --> 56:33.081
I look like a six year old boy.

56:34.781 --> 56:37.050
With a super large mailbox.

56:45.726 --> 56:47.224
Where's Alexandra?

56:47.226 --> 56:49.126
Having dinner with Miles.

56:49.128 --> 56:50.632
Didn't feel like going, huh?

56:51.831 --> 56:52.667
Nope.

56:58.172 --> 56:59.139
Something wrong?

57:00.773 --> 57:01.409
No.

57:04.210 --> 57:05.777
Stop worrying.

57:05.779 --> 57:06.648
I'm not.

57:08.482 --> 57:10.918
I know you better than that.

57:13.087 --> 57:14.953
You should really put
your neck brace on Dad.

57:14.955 --> 57:18.123
You know I really hate it
when people tell me what to do.

57:18.125 --> 57:19.127
Yeah, you and me both.

57:30.270 --> 57:31.304
Um.

57:33.005 --> 57:34.308
That's a little sweet.

57:35.442 --> 57:37.041
Sir, care for a tini?

57:37.043 --> 57:37.878
Sure.

57:39.513 --> 57:40.348
Hey.

57:41.447 --> 57:43.280
Hey.

57:43.282 --> 57:44.719
And here is your twist.

57:47.186 --> 57:50.190
Whatever you guys
need, I'm here for you.

57:57.297 --> 57:58.331
Should we do this?

57:59.967 --> 58:01.302
Yeah, let's go.

58:03.469 --> 58:04.402
Alright.

58:04.404 --> 58:06.538
I will just fire up the playlist

58:06.540 --> 58:09.243
and I will meet you
guys in the master.

58:50.284 --> 58:51.919
Do you really wanna do this?

58:54.154 --> 58:56.054
Let's do this.

58:56.056 --> 58:57.291
Alright.

59:01.994 --> 59:03.330
Does anyone need lip balm?

59:06.866 --> 59:08.366
A little refresher.

59:08.368 --> 59:09.369
Thank you.

59:33.393 --> 59:34.427
Hey!

59:57.551 --> 59:58.386
No, no.

01:00:52.172 --> 01:00:54.342
Oh someone
is very smooth.

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:58.342
Hey Miles, I...

01:00:58.344 --> 01:00:59.480
Oh my god!

01:01:00.947 --> 01:01:01.579
Whoa.

01:01:01.581 --> 01:01:03.213
Dad!

01:01:03.215 --> 01:01:04.051
Oh god.

01:01:05.085 --> 01:01:05.920
- Um.
- Alex.

01:01:07.154 --> 01:01:10.358
I just wanted to know if you
had any more, you know weed.

01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:12.690
Oh god.

01:01:12.692 --> 01:01:14.726
- Um.
- I do.

01:01:14.728 --> 01:01:16.460
- Need any help?
- No!

01:01:16.462 --> 01:01:18.096
- Miles.
- Alex.

01:01:18.098 --> 01:01:19.967
I think we should
leave them alone.

01:01:23.302 --> 01:01:24.205
Alex.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:27.375
Talk to me.

01:01:41.154 --> 01:01:45.757
I know it was embarrassing
but we did it together, right?

01:01:45.759 --> 01:01:47.494
I never wanna do that again.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.567
I can't believe
your dad walked in.

01:01:58.304 --> 01:02:00.206
At least he wasn't
in his underwear.

01:02:06.446 --> 01:02:09.282
I'm not ready
to come out, okay?

01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:28.565
Here's your clothes.

01:02:28.567 --> 01:02:29.436
And a pillow.

01:02:38.344 --> 01:02:41.612
Ah!

01:02:41.614 --> 01:02:43.280
You okay?

01:02:43.282 --> 01:02:44.485
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:02:59.833 --> 01:03:01.469
I'm not going anywhere.

01:03:07.641 --> 01:03:08.476
Okay.

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:24.525
Whoa.

01:03:28.328 --> 01:03:33.333
Oh hey, Matilda and I are
cooking a family meal tomorrow.

01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:39.536
You wanna come?

01:03:39.538 --> 01:03:44.544
- Yeah.
- Oh good.

01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:22.083
You okay?

01:04:25.552 --> 01:04:27.421
I talked to Jenny
before I left.

01:04:29.255 --> 01:04:33.293
And she said that a three way
helped her and Grant connect.

01:04:35.328 --> 01:04:36.697
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:04:39.632 --> 01:04:40.665
We've been connecting.

01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:41.699
I know.

01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:43.471
I just wanted more.

01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:52.643
So, are you into Miles?

01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:53.878
No, god no.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:58.319
I just, wanted to
try to make us work.

01:05:01.587 --> 01:05:03.487
'Cause Jenny and
Grant made it work

01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:05.725
and I thought we would work too.

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:15.202
I think they made it work
because they love each other.

01:05:22.641 --> 01:05:24.708
This is gonna suck.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:25.742
Maybe it won't.

01:05:25.744 --> 01:05:28.313
I don't know.

01:05:28.315 --> 01:05:29.646
Morning.

01:05:29.648 --> 01:05:31.315
What are you doing?

01:05:31.317 --> 01:05:33.684
Making my stew
for family dinner.

01:05:33.686 --> 01:05:36.286
Matilda's coming over to help.

01:05:36.288 --> 01:05:37.790
Alex is going
home tonight, Dad.

01:05:45.799 --> 01:05:46.634
Excuse me.

01:05:49.603 --> 01:05:53.503
I'd really love it if you would
stay for dinner Alexandra.

01:05:53.505 --> 01:05:55.176
It would make me very happy.

01:05:57.944 --> 01:05:58.942
Okay.

01:05:58.944 --> 01:05:59.779
Oh.

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:06.016
Can you go into town
and get me some stuff?

01:06:06.018 --> 01:06:07.719
Sure, what do we need?

01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:09.286
I need a loaf of fresh bread

01:06:09.288 --> 01:06:11.788
and some local beer in bottles.

01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:12.624
Okay.

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:14.992
You wanna come with
me, need anything?

01:06:14.994 --> 01:06:16.694
No, I'll stay.

01:06:16.696 --> 01:06:17.895
Good.

01:06:17.897 --> 01:06:20.264
You can help us with dinner.

01:06:20.266 --> 01:06:20.900
Okay.

01:06:22.469 --> 01:06:23.668
You know I think I'm gonna
go take a shower though.

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:25.206
I'll be back down in a bit.

01:06:25.938 --> 01:06:27.639
Can I watch?

01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:28.676
Jesus, Dad.

01:06:30.677 --> 01:06:31.712
You know what you need?

01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:38.585
You need some of my homemade,
organic ground coffee.

01:06:43.322 --> 01:06:44.389
That sounds good.

01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:46.891
No high fructose corn syrup.

01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:47.728
Thanks.

01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:50.563
Oh that's good, Dad.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.449
Hank.

01:07:12.451 --> 01:07:13.083
Allison.

01:07:13.085 --> 01:07:14.518
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.721
I was just about to
come up to the vineyard.

01:07:16.723 --> 01:07:18.855
Oh man I wish I
knew you were coming.

01:07:18.857 --> 01:07:20.058
Dad and I aren't there today.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.759
Oh.

01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:22.726
No worries.

01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:24.829
I'm gonna be in town
for a couple of days.

01:07:24.831 --> 01:07:26.096
Yeah?

01:07:26.098 --> 01:07:27.699
I'm staying up at the
campsite up in the park.

01:07:27.701 --> 01:07:28.666
That's a great spot.

01:07:28.668 --> 01:07:30.434
Dad and I used to hike
there all the time.

01:07:30.436 --> 01:07:31.069
Um hmm.

01:07:31.071 --> 01:07:32.536
Nice.

01:07:32.538 --> 01:07:34.371
How was the rest of
your motorcycle trip?

01:07:34.373 --> 01:07:35.605
Oh, it sucked.

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:36.541
Why?

01:07:36.543 --> 01:07:37.808
'Cause my bike broke down.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:38.809
Oh no.

01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:40.043
- Uh huh.
- Bummer.

01:07:40.045 --> 01:07:41.381
I get to pick it
up tomorrow though.

01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:44.815
Hey, do you want me
to give you a ride?

01:07:44.817 --> 01:07:46.853
I would love you
giving me a ride, yeah.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.753
That came out wrong, didn't it?

01:07:49.755 --> 01:07:50.790
Did it?

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:54.826
Just I've got it
covered already.

01:07:54.828 --> 01:07:55.726
Alright.

01:07:55.728 --> 01:07:58.929
Hey, you do know
that's the second time

01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:00.630
you turned me down, right?

01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:01.935
Uh yep.

01:08:02.802 --> 01:08:03.937
Here's my number.

01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:07.471
It was really nice
to see you again.

01:08:07.473 --> 01:08:08.841
Was good to see you too.

01:08:09.842 --> 01:08:13.076
Let me know when I can
come up to the vineyard

01:08:13.078 --> 01:08:15.512
and meet that
crazy dad of yours.

01:08:15.514 --> 01:08:16.350
I will.

01:08:17.616 --> 01:08:18.448
- Alright.
- Good to see you.

01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:19.484
Cool.

01:08:19.486 --> 01:08:20.321
Good to see you too.

01:08:21.854 --> 01:08:22.787
- Okay.
- Alright.

01:08:22.788 --> 01:08:23.953
Have fun shopping.

01:08:23.956 --> 01:08:25.890
Yeah, have fun
driving and drinking.

01:08:25.892 --> 01:08:27.024
I will.

01:08:27.026 --> 01:08:28.024
Bye.

01:08:28.026 --> 01:08:29.562
Have a nice day.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.966
- It's a character...
- Ah, good year.

01:08:35.968 --> 01:08:39.903
Apparently twins and
IBS can skip a generation.

01:08:39.904 --> 01:08:41.506
Nice ring.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:42.810
Oh Henry makes them.

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:44.841
Wow.

01:08:44.844 --> 01:08:46.810
You should really
start making these again.

01:08:46.812 --> 01:08:48.979
I wish I could afford to.

01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:50.613
This stew is so good.

01:08:50.616 --> 01:08:51.783
Oh I'm glad you like it.

01:08:51.785 --> 01:08:53.751
It's different
than your usual, Dad.

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:55.720
Well Matilda
help me with that.

01:08:55.721 --> 01:08:57.755
She added her own sherry and...

01:08:57.756 --> 01:08:58.890
A lot of sherry.

01:08:59.959 --> 01:09:00.861
That's so sweet.

01:09:02.995 --> 01:09:04.897
Well man, I am done.

01:09:05.865 --> 01:09:08.064
Oh god, here we go.

01:09:08.066 --> 01:09:11.734
Hey, at least I'm
wearing my brand new

01:09:11.737 --> 01:09:13.203
four and half
pocket blue shorts.

01:09:13.205 --> 01:09:14.872
Woo woo.

01:09:14.874 --> 01:09:16.741
Dad those shorts are purple.

01:09:16.743 --> 01:09:17.975
- No they're not.
- They're purple.

01:09:17.977 --> 01:09:19.542
Can you tell him those
are purple shorts.

01:09:19.545 --> 01:09:21.011
No, let me take a closer look.

01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:22.212
I think they might be lilac.

01:09:22.214 --> 01:09:23.613
These are, oh
maybe they're lilac.

01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:24.715
Alright, I'm going
in the hot tub.

01:09:24.716 --> 01:09:25.550
I'll clean up.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:26.184
Oh, hot tub, yeah.

01:09:26.185 --> 01:09:27.018
No you guys, do not.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:27.850
I'll clean up.

01:09:27.853 --> 01:09:28.885
I will clean up.

01:09:28.886 --> 01:09:29.720
I'll clean up.

01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:30.988
Please.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:31.825
Alright.

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:35.626
You coming in?

01:09:35.627 --> 01:09:36.560
I might.

01:09:36.562 --> 01:09:38.060
I think I'm gonna go pack.

01:09:38.063 --> 01:09:41.599
Alexandra you are not
driving home tonight.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.934
Okay.

01:09:42.935 --> 01:09:44.667
I need to use the
little girls room.

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:45.836
Oh yeah, use the
one in my bedroom.

01:09:45.837 --> 01:09:48.072
And knock, you never know
who you're gonna walk in on.

01:09:48.073 --> 01:09:49.607
Oh Jesus Dad.

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:50.742
- Too soon, too soon.
- Hey, hey,

01:09:50.743 --> 01:09:53.679
what do they say about not
being able to take a joke?

01:10:39.057 --> 01:10:40.591
So last night was...

01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:42.193
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:10:42.195 --> 01:10:42.996
Ever.

01:10:47.267 --> 01:10:49.065
It's just the thing
about last night.

01:10:49.067 --> 01:10:49.867
Is that...

01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:50.670
Dude.

01:10:52.938 --> 01:10:53.673
Sorry.

01:10:58.977 --> 01:11:02.212
I just wanted to say I
think of you like a brother.

01:11:02.214 --> 01:11:04.784
You realize how weird
that sounds now, right?

01:11:11.023 --> 01:11:13.893
You're like a brother to me too.

01:11:17.597 --> 01:11:21.832
You know I've been thinking
about Hank Murphy's Garage.

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:22.669
What about it?

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.672
I thought you were
gonna come in.

01:11:31.611 --> 01:11:32.245
What's wrong?

01:11:33.879 --> 01:11:35.081
I know where you went today.

01:11:36.148 --> 01:11:37.918
What are you talking about?

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:42.153
Really, Hank?

01:11:42.155 --> 01:11:43.156
While I'm here.

01:11:45.223 --> 01:11:47.091
Why are you going
through my stuff?

01:11:47.093 --> 01:11:49.060
I'm not gonna let you
do this to me again.

01:11:49.062 --> 01:11:50.595
I should've gone home.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:52.532
I'll see you next
week at the attorney.

01:11:54.032 --> 01:11:55.268
I didn't do anything.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:59.039
- Yep.
- Yeah, very.

01:12:00.205 --> 01:12:03.040
So why can't I sleep at night?

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:04.076
- Goblins.
- Goblins!

01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:07.079
Dark and
mysterious forces.

01:12:13.085 --> 01:12:15.051
You've always
been so sweet to me.

01:12:15.053 --> 01:12:17.924
I've always thought of
you as the bees knees.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:22.262
Oh Alexandra.

01:12:26.031 --> 01:12:27.098
It was really
nice to meet you.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.168
You too sweetheart.

01:12:31.169 --> 01:12:33.037
Are you leaving?

01:12:33.039 --> 01:12:34.037
Yeah.

01:12:34.039 --> 01:12:35.405
Bye Miles.

01:12:35.407 --> 01:12:36.209
Aw.

01:12:41.347 --> 01:12:43.150
Take care of him.

01:12:44.116 --> 01:12:44.918
I will.

01:13:46.478 --> 01:13:47.744
- Yes.
- Are you ready for this?

01:13:47.746 --> 01:13:49.682
I'm just, am I ready?

01:13:50.816 --> 01:13:51.881
Put your hand behind your back.

01:13:51.883 --> 01:13:53.050
- Okay.
- Okay keep it there.

01:13:53.052 --> 01:13:53.850
No cheating.

01:13:53.852 --> 01:13:54.484
Got it.

01:13:54.486 --> 01:13:55.920
Always cheating.

01:13:55.922 --> 01:13:58.025
Alright you're stuck,
I'm stuck, we go again.

01:13:59.258 --> 01:14:00.291
- No looking.
- I'm really glad

01:14:00.293 --> 01:14:01.926
you came out tonight.

01:14:01.928 --> 01:14:02.993
- Me too.
- Cool.

01:14:02.995 --> 01:14:05.766
Alright, one, two, three go.

01:14:08.234 --> 01:14:09.332
Still stuck.

01:14:09.334 --> 01:14:10.167
Still stuck.

01:14:10.169 --> 01:14:11.202
Okay.

01:14:11.204 --> 01:14:13.173
One, two, three.

01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:17.274
I'm still stuck.

01:14:17.276 --> 01:14:18.078
Okay.

01:14:23.816 --> 01:14:24.982
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:24.984 --> 01:14:25.815
- Go.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:25.817 --> 01:14:26.449
Go.

01:14:26.451 --> 01:14:28.051
Ace on two, ace on two.

01:14:28.053 --> 01:14:30.820
Okay, so I talked to a business
investor friend of mine

01:14:30.822 --> 01:14:34.091
and he checked out
this website of yours.

01:14:34.093 --> 01:14:38.229
He digs your stuff and you
can expect an e-mail from him.

01:14:38.231 --> 01:14:39.430
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:14:39.432 --> 01:14:40.463
You did that for me?

01:14:40.465 --> 01:14:42.166
Yeah.

01:14:42.168 --> 01:14:43.199
No.

01:14:43.201 --> 01:14:44.236
Well.

01:14:47.205 --> 01:14:48.905
Better get back to
it, Mister Hank.

01:14:48.907 --> 01:14:49.540
Thank you.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:50.774
Really, you're awesome.

01:14:50.776 --> 01:14:52.009
Um hmm.

01:14:52.011 --> 01:14:53.377
So they say.

01:14:53.379 --> 01:14:54.979
Yeah, is that what they say?

01:14:54.981 --> 01:14:55.813
You should keep playing.

01:14:55.815 --> 01:14:56.450
Okay, okay.

01:14:59.252 --> 01:15:01.487
Can I ask you a question?

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:05.057
Of course.

01:15:06.258 --> 01:15:07.390
Why did you come
up with an excuse

01:15:07.392 --> 01:15:09.361
for me not to come
to the vineyard?

01:15:13.432 --> 01:15:16.369
Because my wife was there.

01:15:18.337 --> 01:15:19.170
Oh.

01:15:20.272 --> 01:15:22.506
We're signing divorce
papers next week.

01:15:22.508 --> 01:15:24.811
She picked me up after
my bike broke down.

01:15:26.178 --> 01:15:27.213
Well that's convenient.

01:15:28.914 --> 01:15:31.015
So you guys still get along?

01:15:31.017 --> 01:15:32.015
Yeah.

01:15:32.017 --> 01:15:32.852
Yeah we do.

01:15:34.085 --> 01:15:34.987
She still there?

01:15:36.155 --> 01:15:36.990
No.

01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:39.055
We got into a fight.

01:15:39.057 --> 01:15:40.192
She left about an hour ago.

01:15:44.262 --> 01:15:46.232
What did you guys
get into a fight about?

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:49.903
She saw your note.

01:15:53.371 --> 01:15:55.307
I'm sorry?

01:15:58.977 --> 01:16:02.815
So, you spent the last
few days with her.

01:16:05.884 --> 01:16:08.853
Hard to explain, but
we were trying to see

01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:11.087
if we could make things work.

01:16:11.089 --> 01:16:11.924
But.

01:16:14.927 --> 01:16:15.562
But.

01:16:29.374 --> 01:16:30.342
Come dance with me.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:33.106
I really like you Hank.

01:17:38.576 --> 01:17:39.980
I really like you too.

01:17:40.713 --> 01:17:41.882
But I love my wife.

01:17:44.282 --> 01:17:46.050
Tell your friend thank you.

01:17:46.052 --> 01:17:49.456
But, my weird brother
wants to fund my business.

01:17:51.389 --> 01:17:53.058
I wanna keep it in the family.

01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:56.529
You're a good guy.

01:18:03.369 --> 01:18:04.667
I should get outta here.

01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:07.440
Yeah, go.

01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:29.596
Hmm.

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:35.466
I've been meaning to
tell you something

01:18:35.468 --> 01:18:38.538
ever since you
showed up with Alex.

01:18:39.504 --> 01:18:40.539
What's that?

01:18:42.475 --> 01:18:44.541
This is gonna sound like
sappy shit coming from me

01:18:44.543 --> 01:18:46.112
but I don't give a rat's ass.

01:18:47.178 --> 01:18:49.014
Unnecessarily
vulgar, but keep going.

01:18:53.018 --> 01:18:56.088
I think we're on this Earth

01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:59.025
to experience love.

01:19:01.427 --> 01:19:03.196
And take it from
someone who knows,

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:08.067
love never feels more meaningful

01:19:09.435 --> 01:19:11.036
than when you don't have it.

01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:17.544
Is that it?

01:19:19.812 --> 01:19:20.647
Yep.

01:19:24.417 --> 01:19:29.422
Oh, she called about
10 minutes ago.

01:19:31.389 --> 01:19:33.258
She forgot her makeup bag.

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:36.627
Asked if you could take it back.

01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:37.594
Where is she?

01:19:37.596 --> 01:19:38.464
I don't know.

01:19:39.632 --> 01:19:41.167
Sounded like a bar.

01:19:46.638 --> 01:19:47.473

01:19:57.583 --> 01:19:59.349
Hey, hey sweetheart.

01:19:59.351 --> 01:20:00.716
A fax came in for you.

01:20:00.718 --> 01:20:03.086
With some very
specific instructions

01:20:03.088 --> 01:20:04.356
as to what to do with it.

01:20:05.624 --> 01:20:07.227
Oh he also paid your bill.

01:20:12.231 --> 01:20:13.764

I hope you're not

01:20:13.766 --> 01:20:15.502

else's beer again.

01:20:16.602 --> 01:20:19.506
Second, I miss you already.

01:20:20.873 --> 01:20:24.541
Third, I can only
imagine how hurt you felt

01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:25.745
when you saw that note.

01:20:26.779 --> 01:20:28.048
I'm really sorry.

01:20:29.248 --> 01:20:30.646
I was an idiot for
letting you leave

01:20:30.648 --> 01:20:33.149
without telling
you what happened.

01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:34.551
I met her on my trip

01:20:34.553 --> 01:20:37.621
and I know what that
note makes it look like.

01:20:37.623 --> 01:20:40.623
I'll explain everything,
but right now

01:20:40.625 --> 01:20:43.530
I just wanna tell you
how much I love you.

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:46.633
I love you a lot.

01:20:48.534 --> 01:20:50.399

01:20:50.401 --> 01:20:51.703
is also my fourth pick.

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:54.139
Meet me at the bridge.

01:20:55.273 --> 01:20:56.873
I wanna give it another shot.

01:20:56.875 --> 01:20:58.343
But with you this time.

01:20:59.512 --> 01:21:00.877
I know how much you
like to sleep in.

01:21:00.879 --> 01:21:04.480
And I have something to
take care of in the morning.

01:21:04.482 --> 01:21:06.386
So let's make it noon o'clock.

So.

01:24:29.922 --> 01:24:31.290
It was a very sweet letter.

01:24:33.959 --> 01:24:36.025
I came here all prepared
to give you some big speech

01:24:36.027 --> 01:24:38.530
about finding
purpose in my life.

01:24:39.764 --> 01:24:40.932
But then I realized,

01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:46.502
that the most important
thing I needed to say to you

01:24:46.504 --> 01:24:49.808
was that my life doesn't
have a purpose without you.

01:24:51.877 --> 01:24:54.711
I'm glad you came here
tonight finish the game.

01:24:54.713 --> 01:24:55.815
This isn't part of it.

01:24:58.984 --> 01:25:02.021

01:25:10.862 --> 01:25:11.897
Maybe.

01:25:13.432 --> 01:25:14.864
This is stupid.

01:25:14.866 --> 01:25:15.868
Just do it.

01:25:17.969 --> 01:25:19.438
Can you jump from here?

01:25:22.807 --> 01:25:24.109
You only live once!

01:25:28.679 --> 01:25:29.679
- Oh my god!

God I can't believe I
almost jumped from there.

01:25:47.732 --> 01:25:50.503
You can jump, you just have
to jump from right there.

01:25:51.203 --> 01:25:52.969
- Right here?
- Yeah.

01:25:52.971 --> 01:25:54.604
You didn't hear that from me.

01:25:54.606 --> 01:25:55.441
Thanks man.

01:25:58.944 --> 01:26:00.743
So where were we?

01:26:00.745 --> 01:26:04.850
Well, I just asked
you to remarry me.

01:26:06.919 --> 01:26:09.085
Before I answer,
I have a question.

01:26:09.087 --> 01:26:10.990
And this is my last one.

01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:13.159
What is it?

01:26:14.993 --> 01:26:16.025
Do you remember the
last thing we said

01:26:16.027 --> 01:26:17.029
when we got married?

01:26:19.565 --> 01:26:22.933
I promise to keep
things fun, spontaneous,

01:26:22.935 --> 01:26:26.873

hand through everything.

can't remarry you.

01:26:33.879 --> 01:26:35.612
Okay.

01:26:35.614 --> 01:26:37.881
Just the thought
of starting over

01:26:37.883 --> 01:26:40.486
after everything we've been
through, I can't do it.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.551
I understand.

01:26:42.553 --> 01:26:43.556
No you don't understand.

01:26:44.822 --> 01:26:46.590
I love you Hank.

01:26:46.592 --> 01:26:48.725
But I don't wanna remarry you.

01:26:48.727 --> 01:26:51.497
I just wanna work on the
marriage that we already have.

01:26:56.968 --> 01:27:00.069
And you wanna do your last one?

01:27:00.071 --> 01:27:02.605
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

01:27:06.044 --> 01:27:07.113
It's so high!

01:27:10.081 --> 01:27:13.018
- Let's do it.
- Alright, let's do it.

01:27:19.924 --> 01:27:21.056

01:27:21.058 --> 01:27:21.927
