WEBVTT

00:52.220 --> 00:53.262
Shh!

01:21.374 --> 01:23.793
Gee, this is wonderful, Uncle John.

01:23.960 --> 01:29.507
<i>The Ape Man Of Forbidden Mountain.</i>
What a groovy title <i>for</i> a picture.

01:29.674 --> 01:32.760
It sure was swell of you
to give us jobs as extras.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.012
Kids, I'm the grateful one.

01:35.179 --> 01:38.349
I need you because the local people
won't work in this film.

01:38.516 --> 01:43.521
- Why is that, Mr. Maxwell?
- The local people are superstitious.

01:45.648 --> 01:48.609
They believe an old legend
about a real Ape Man.

01:48.776 --> 01:52.196
They say he's the one that burned down
the old mansion years ago.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.742
- How do I look?
- How do you look?

01:56.909 --> 01:58.411
I don't see any difference.

02:00.413 --> 02:04.208
We've had three reports that the Ape Man
has been seen up here at night.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.002
They've seen a real Ape Man?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.547
Real Ape Man?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.551
I just remembered a dental appointment
back in town.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.220
- Me too.
- Stop it, you two.

02:16.387 --> 02:19.390
It's only a superstition.
Right, Uncle John?

02:19.557 --> 02:23.602
Right. The only Ape Man on this mountain
is my stuntman Carl.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.732
Any time you're ready, J.J.

02:29.108 --> 02:32.611
All right, Miss Mint, you just run out
on the rope bridge. Okay?

02:32.778 --> 02:34.822
Right, Mr. Maxwell.

02:34.989 --> 02:38.743
That's our star, Candy Mint.
And you'll see Carl in the Ape Man suit.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.120
Okay, roll them!

02:47.918 --> 02:50.755
Man, he could be for real. What a beast.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.923
Yeah, beast.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.263
Great. He's even better
than he was in rehearsal.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.098
Now, watch Candy on the bridge.

03:07.396 --> 03:12.193
Watch the Ape Man jump up and down
on the bridge and try to spill Candy.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.947
No, Carl! Stop it!
That's not in the script!

03:17.782 --> 03:19.158
Help!

03:22.370 --> 03:23.788
I don't think he heard you.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.957
He heard me,
but that ape is not my stuntman.

03:28.084 --> 03:29.794
Somebody, make him stop!

03:29.960 --> 03:31.879
Scooby-Doo!

03:34.632 --> 03:36.217
Help! Help!

03:41.138 --> 03:42.973
Scooby, steady the bridge!

03:44.892 --> 03:47.395
- She made it!
- And Scooby did it!

03:52.900 --> 03:53.984
Uh-oh!

04:15.840 --> 04:19.677
- Good show, Scooby.
- You sure sent that thing packing.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.846
You were so brave.

04:22.388 --> 04:25.850
Aw. Scooby-Dooby-Doo.

04:27.852 --> 04:31.689
- That was a daring rescue, Scooby.
- He was better than Laddie.

04:31.856 --> 04:35.693
- What do we do now, Mr. Maxwell?
- Find my missing stuntman, Carl.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.696
- This is his trailer.
- Maybe we can pick up a clue...

04:38.863 --> 04:41.240
to where Carl might be.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.325
I'm worried.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.495
I didn't put much stock
in that Ape Man legend until now.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.080
Hmm.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.717
Hey, Scooby, is that you acting scared?

05:01.552 --> 05:03.929
Ape Man's head.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.726
Ape Man's head?
Oh, that's just part of a costume.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.562
Phew.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.403
Hey, that's a good trick.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.405
- HoW'd you do it?
- I don't know.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.325
Then there must be somebody
in the trunk.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.745
- Come on, Scooby, open it.
- Uh-uh. Not me.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.414
- Yes, you.
- Now, Scooby...

05:30.581 --> 05:33.918
don't go into one of your acts.
Just open the trunk.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.669
Okay.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.091
- It's a man!
- It's a man?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.844
It must be Carl, the stuntman.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.597
- What happened?
- I came in to dress...

05:46.764 --> 05:50.100
and a big, hairy animal grabbed me
and threw me in the trunk.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.270
- Was it the Ape Man?
- Ape Man? What's going on?

05:53.437 --> 05:57.441
An Ape Man of some kind sabotaged
our shooting and almost hurt Candy.

05:57.608 --> 06:01.111
The old legend, huh?
It must have been him that got me.

06:01.278 --> 06:06.200
Oh, Mr. Maxwell, I'm sorry,
but I quit until that beast is caught.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.370
I'm with her.
Mr. Maxwell, I'm quitting too.

06:09.537 --> 06:12.665
Can't you wait a few days?
I'll get this mystery cleared up.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.668
I'm afraid I'll have to withdraw
my job offer.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.836
It's just too dangerous right now.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.047
- Yeah!
- Maybe we can give you a hand...

06:20.214 --> 06:21.632
in solving this mystery.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.301
- Well...
- We can stand guard.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.804
Yeah, who's afraid of a big, bad ape?

06:26.971 --> 06:29.014
I am.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.229
Okay, gang,
Daphne's uncle let us stay...

06:35.396 --> 06:37.064
on the condition we be careful.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.649
According to the legend...

06:38.816 --> 06:42.027
the Ape Man lives in a secret cave
somewhere in the rocks.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.530
It's strange how he was smart enough...

06:44.697 --> 06:48.659
- to get rid of that stuntman.
- There's something fishy about that.

06:48.826 --> 06:52.955
A dumb Ape Man is bad enough.
One that smart I can live without.

06:53.122 --> 06:56.458
- Get it? Live without.
- Me too.

06:57.001 --> 07:01.338
Did you know that this set is built
on the ruins of the original old mansion?

07:01.505 --> 07:04.341
Zooks! There should be some good
clue-hunting around here.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.678
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's search.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.888
Scooby-Doo!

07:12.766 --> 07:15.561
Keep a sharp lookout for anything
that will give us a clue.

07:17.855 --> 07:20.149
Hey, Scooby, what's that you found?

07:22.818 --> 07:24.862
Somebody left half a hamburger.

07:25.029 --> 07:28.866
- Hunting clues always makes me hungry.
- Wait!

07:29.033 --> 07:32.161
- That's a clue.
- Don't eat that clue, Shaggy.

07:32.328 --> 07:35.831
- Huh? Clue?
- Yeah, clue.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.334
See those claw marks?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.794
The Ape Man was eating this sandwich.

07:40.961 --> 07:46.091
- That's odd. Apes don't eat meat.
- Maybe this Ape Man is more than an ape.

07:46.258 --> 07:50.929
- It's okay, Shaggy. You can eat it.
- What? Me eat after an ape?

07:51.096 --> 07:52.848
I can't do it.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.351
I'll do it.

07:58.395 --> 08:02.066
Okay, let's split up and search
for this Ape Man who eats hamburgers.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.569
And remember, this set was built
to make a scary movie.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.571
80 watch out for trap doors.

08:07.905 --> 08:11.909
Trap doors? Hidden bedrooms?

08:13.577 --> 08:18.040
- It's kind of spooky in here.
- Oh, don't be a scaredy-cat.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.376
VOICE.
Stick them up. What's the password?

08:20.834 --> 08:25.881
- Shaggy, are you trying to be funny?
- No, but somebody else is trying.

08:26.048 --> 08:28.175
VOICE.
Stick them up. What's the password?

08:32.388 --> 08:34.515
Stick them up. What's the password?

08:34.682 --> 08:37.142
The great ape is first-rate.

08:37.309 --> 08:40.145
Wait a minute. That sounds like a parrot.

08:40.312 --> 08:43.232
Stick them up. What's the password?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.777
Scooby-Doo!

08:46.944 --> 08:50.280
That's what I call fowl play. Get it?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.082
It's the Ape Man! Look out!

09:01.875 --> 09:05.129
Help! He got me!

09:11.885 --> 09:15.639
Can't we talk this over
man to Ape Man?

09:15.806 --> 09:18.267
Shaggy, that ape is stuffed.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.145
Stuffed ape?

09:21.311 --> 09:24.982
Well, I hope you don't think
it had me fooled for a minute.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.942
I knew it all the time.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.112
Oh, brother.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.324
There isn't anything in here
but old books.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.243
Here's something.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.746
A copy of the film's shooting script.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.498
Next you'll say the Ape Man
was here reading it.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.668
It was left open to the scene
they were shooting today.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.504
Maybe there's a clue up here
on these shelves.

09:47.671 --> 09:51.049
Hey, did you know that in
the film, people vanished from this room?

10:10.778 --> 10:12.196
Hmm?

10:22.706 --> 10:25.000
Hey, where did Freddy go?

10:25.584 --> 10:26.835
He's vanished!

10:27.085 --> 10:29.087
Hey. Psst.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.716
- What's with Scooby-Doo?
- Something about the mirror.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.384
Watch.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.723
- Something phony.
- Something phony?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.061
See?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.983
Zoinks!

10:50.400 --> 10:53.028
Cut out! It's the Ape Man!

10:54.822 --> 10:56.490
Ifslocked.

10:58.826 --> 11:03.372
- Scooby, do something.
- Yeah. Talk to him, dog to beast.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.138
Whatever you said, Scooby, it's working.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.140
He's retreating. After him.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.614
It's dark at the top of the stairs.
He'll get away.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.449
Turn on some lights, Daphne.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.286
Oh, dear. Which is the right switch?

11:43.662 --> 11:46.456
Wrong switch, Daphne.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.251
Scooby-Doo!

11:49.418 --> 11:51.628
Why didn't you put
on the brakes, Scooby?

11:51.795 --> 11:53.213
I like to slide.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.968
He likes to slide. Oh, boy.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.684
That puts the stairs back,
but I wonder what the other switches do.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.978
Well, with your luck, Daph...

12:08.145 --> 12:11.815
the next button you push will bring
the roof down, but go ahead.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.818
I'll try this one.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.323
- Hi, gang.
- It's Freddy!

12:19.489 --> 12:23.660
- Boy, the Ape Man almost got us.
- But Scooby scared him away.

12:23.911 --> 12:28.582
Well, I found the perfect trap
for the Ape Man. Come on.

12:37.382 --> 12:41.511
Now, this is the basement where the
last scenes of the movie are to be shot.

12:41.678 --> 12:46.183
Look up there on the ceiling. That net was
put up to capture the Ape Man in the film.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.353
And we can use it to capture
the real Ape Man.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.439
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Great. How do you know it will work?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.483
I've tested it. See that pulley?

12:54.650 --> 12:58.111
The net's connected to the rope,
the rope runs down to the reel...

12:58.278 --> 13:02.866
and the reel is wired to that dark switch
box, which you'll pull to release the net.

13:03.033 --> 13:06.036
And look, under the net
there's an X on the floor...

13:06.203 --> 13:08.872
where the Ape Man should be
when the net falls.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.500
But how are we gonna get him
to stand there?

13:11.667 --> 13:14.336
Simple, Daphne.
When the Ape Man reaches the X...

13:14.503 --> 13:17.881
we will put the spotlight on him
and blind him for a second...

13:18.048 --> 13:20.008
while Velma pulls the switch.

13:20.175 --> 13:23.387
Yeah, but how are you gonna get
the Ape Man down in the basement?

13:24.388 --> 13:25.889
Mm-hm.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.393
- Hey, don't look at me.
- Don't look at me.

13:29.559 --> 13:34.022
Scooby, will you do it
for a few Scooby Snacks?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.233
Hmm.

13:37.109 --> 13:40.404
You get a bonus snack after you get
the Ape Man down here.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.239
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.826
Scooby Snacks won't work
on me this time.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.705
Would you do it for a Shaggy Snack?
A little something I whipped up.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.748
Uh? A Shaggy Snack?

13:51.915 --> 13:57.713
Yes. It's a potpie with pizza
crust, anchovies, pepperoni, cherries...

13:57.879 --> 14:01.008
and all in a thick chocolate sauce.

14:01.174 --> 14:06.263
- I'II do it. I'll do it.
- Let's go. Scooby-Doo!

14:17.691 --> 14:21.445
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.780
It came from this room.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.870
Wow, look at those trophies.

14:30.037 --> 14:34.708
A deer, a rhino, a lion and a...

14:35.709 --> 14:37.461
Ape Man?

14:37.878 --> 14:41.381
Ape Man? Don't be silly.
That's only a trophy.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.760
Come on, let's play a game, Scooby.

14:51.850 --> 14:56.980
Some trophies. One, two, three, four.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.568
- Hey, Shaggy.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.987
Watch this shot.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.406
One, two, three...

15:06.740 --> 15:10.410
Eight ball in the corner pocket.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.497
Sorry, Scooby.
Uh-oh.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.333
One, two, three...

15:16.666 --> 15:20.796
Let's see, Scooby's over there.
Then who is-?

15:24.174 --> 15:25.842
Let's go!

15:44.027 --> 15:45.612
Here they come. Ready, Velma?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.072
All set, Freddy.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.247
No, Scooby, not here.

15:56.873 --> 16:00.043
Hey, you're steaming up my glasses.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.920
Get ready to spring the trap!

16:05.298 --> 16:06.633
Now, Velma!

16:06.883 --> 16:10.554
I can't see. I hope this is it.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.141
Pull the other switch, Velma!
Quick, spring the trap!

16:14.307 --> 16:15.892
I'm trying.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.730
That's it. Now get the lights back on.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.317
Hey, we got him. Come on, gang.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.990
Yeah, you got him.
King Kong in the flesh.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.075
King Kong.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.001
It's a cinch that Ape Man
is still in the basement.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.171
- He didn't have time to go back upstairs.
- Hey, gang.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.132
- Looks like Scooby found a clue.
- What is it?

16:47.299 --> 16:49.342
Scooby's pointing to a tuft of hair...

16:49.509 --> 16:52.721
- caught in this cask.
- Let's have a look.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.892
So the Ape Man ran by here.
What does it prove?

16:57.058 --> 17:01.229
- Maybe it's not a wine cask.
- Okay, if it's not, what do you think it is?

17:04.024 --> 17:06.359
Offhand, I'd call it a door.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.154
It's a tunnel that goes back
into the mountain.

17:09.321 --> 17:10.530
Oh.

17:10.697 --> 17:14.201
So this is the way he escaped.
He won't get away this time.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.539
The film company
didn't build this tunnel.

17:19.706 --> 17:23.543
No, this is more like the cave
where the Ape Man is supposed to live.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.546
- If you believe the old legend.
- I believe it.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.134
Where are we?

17:32.177 --> 17:35.388
Wow, the dressing rooms
for the movie people.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.557
And we'd better search them. Come on.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.983
We'll split up here.
Shaggy, you and Scooby take this one.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.818
Now, play it cool.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.445
Cool? I'm an ice cube.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.407
We'll go on and take the next one.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.911
Look at all this groovy stuff.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.207
Man, we could play Halloween.
Check this, Scooby.

18:02.374 --> 18:06.544
Give me liberty,
or give me pizza pie.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.174
Hey, Shag.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.263
That's great, Scooby.

18:17.430 --> 18:20.934
Hey, here's one of those jiffy cameras.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.397
It develops a shot in less than a minute.
I'll take your picture.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.566
- Act fierce.
- Okay.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.280
Great. Do another.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.448
How's this?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.826
I've gotta wind in another frame.

18:37.993 --> 18:42.872
Uh-oh. That's the Ape Man
in the mirror without his mask on. Hey.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.668
Look out, Scooby! The Ape Man!

18:48.420 --> 18:50.255
Gangway!

18:51.256 --> 18:53.008
I got it!

18:58.096 --> 19:00.640
Hey, gang, I got the Ape Man on film.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.103
That's Shaggy and Scooby!

19:11.985 --> 19:16.448
I got a picture of the Ape Man
without his mask. He's right behind us.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.659
Quick! Run for the house
so we can trap him.

19:23.997 --> 19:27.542
Keep going right up the stairs
and don't stop.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.726
Help!

19:48.396 --> 19:53.610
Hey, look at this snapshot.
Here's a clue to end all clues.

19:53.777 --> 19:56.571
Take a look at our Ape Man.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.618
It's Carl, the stuntman!

20:03.912 --> 20:06.373
Yep, Carl decided to sabotage
the picture...

20:06.539 --> 20:09.876
just because I wouldn't let him
play the lead. What a pity.

20:10.126 --> 20:13.588
It sure was clever of him to lock
himself in that trunk yesterday.

20:13.755 --> 20:17.133
And tell that phony story
about the Ape Man throwing him in.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.886
Well, I can't thank you kids enough.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.639
Shaggy should get most of the credit.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.724
Where is Shaggy?

20:26.142 --> 20:27.894
Oh, no, not again.

20:29.396 --> 20:33.233
Looks like Shaggy wants to try
for the Ape Man role in the picture.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.442
Surprise.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.905
But there's Scooby-Doo in the other chair.

20:39.406 --> 20:44.077
Surprise. It's the Scooby head
the Ape Man was wearing.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.541
Now, there's real talent.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.712
We sure fooled them, Scooby.
We ought to be in the movies.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.091
Yeah. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

21:54.189 --> 21:55.231
Shh!
