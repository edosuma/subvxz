WEBVTT

00:13.764 --> 00:14.806
Is everything okay?

00:14.806 --> 00:16.975
I'm just here outside a launderette
called Launderette,

00:17.851 --> 00:20.604
- wondering where the hell you are.
- What? Danny, you came to get me?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.814
- <i>Danny, I'm really sorry.</i>
- Listen, night, Leese.

00:23.482 --> 00:24.525
I--

00:24.525 --> 00:25.859
Hello?

00:32.573 --> 00:35.035
- Mum just texted to say Poppy's out cold.
- Oh, yeah?

00:35.035 --> 00:38.121
I'm not surprised.
They took her Nordic walking today.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.082
Okay.

00:40.791 --> 00:41.750
How's the tea?

00:41.750 --> 00:44.670
Man in the shop said it really worked
for him. Is it helping you sleep?

00:44.670 --> 00:47.214
Yeah. I mean, you know,
every time I try and drink it,

00:47.214 --> 00:49.258
I think I'm gonna pass out, so...

00:50.175 --> 00:52.678
I'm about to do my night yoga
with the woman you suggested.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.638
- Great. Yeah. Oh, yeah, Rebecca.
- Yeah.

00:54.638 --> 00:58.016
Yeah, she's a really positive instructor.
You know, great for your mindset.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.309
- You love a good mindset.
- Know what?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.938
I didn't realize how bad my mindset was
until I started doing her classes.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.816
But now I feel like my mindset is just...

01:08.610 --> 01:11.321
I'm just-- I'm glad
you're getting into more of a routine.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.365
You know, after the other night.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.449
Yeah, me too.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.953
Great. Well, it is my bedtime.

01:17.953 --> 01:21.248
Well, I'll see you up there.
As in, I will actually see you up there.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.749
Amazing.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.834
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.462
I forgot to mention.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.798
You know the hobbyhorse
my dad made for Poppy?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.474
Jesus!

01:44.479 --> 01:46.398
Right. You are coming with me.

01:49.693 --> 01:50.819
Yeah, I think so.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.655
Do you know where it is?
I've looked everywhere. I can't find it.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.532
They wanna have a photo of her
with it tomorrow.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.617
A photo? Why?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.702
For the family newsletter.
<i>The Cutting Vedge</i>.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.787
Dad wants to show it off
to the Australian cousins.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.831
He says it's the best example
of his whittling.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.709
Well, yeah, I think it's probably just
in Poppy's wardrobe.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.794
I did check there. But, you know,
I'll have another look.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.714
No! No need. I'll do it. You're tired.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.799
- Only if you're sure.
- Yeah.

02:12.799 --> 02:13.884
Great. Well...

02:13.884 --> 02:15.093
See you in a sec.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.726
'Course.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.365
Okay.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.466
That's too much.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.528
I wasn't watching you sleep,
if that's what you're thinking.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.280
- Right.
- No, no. I can--

03:58.280 --> 04:00.616
I can see why you're thinking
that's what I was doing--

04:00.616 --> 04:02.576
Right. Because you were watching me sleep.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.369
But I was standing--
Yeah, okay sure, I was watch--

04:04.369 --> 04:05.954
But it was not in a creepy way or--

04:05.954 --> 04:08.165
Is there a non-creepy way
to watch a woman sleep?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.584
Yeah. I've heard--
Yeah, there's-- I hear there's loads.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.295
Okay. This should be good.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.589
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.841
One, Sleeping Beauty.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.343
Man not only watches

04:19.343 --> 04:22.179
but kisses sleeping woman
and brings her back to life.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.472
And that was a prince.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.558
Okay. One, princes can still be creepy.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.935
I think that's established.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.688
And two,
that story actually hasn't aged well.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.482
It's kind of problematic.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.902
There's more. Two.
A doctor monitoring a coma patient.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.654
You see, in that scenario,

04:38.654 --> 04:42.282
I'm imagining you became a doctor
just so you could watch women sleep.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.952
I promise, I wasn't watching you sleep.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.205
Are you always this easy to wind up?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.666
Yes, famously I am. You got me.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.835
And a midnight feast of Jammie Dodgers.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.461
That's definitely not creepy.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.797
Truth is I was trying to figure out
how to say something to you.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.049
I thought now could be a good time
to do it while you were asleep.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.426
- I was just trying to--
- Why? What did you wanna say?

05:02.594 --> 05:04.930
Thank you, really.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.391
For what? The sex?

05:07.391 --> 05:11.812
No, no. I mean, not no. Yes.
That was very nice. Good.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.231
But, no. No, for giving me another chance.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.482
You mean after...

05:15.482 --> 05:17.234
- Get it out! Get it out!
- Oh, God!

05:17.234 --> 05:19.403
My bloody finger. What are you doing?

05:20.362 --> 05:21.488
Yeah, after that.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.323
- It's fine.
- It is fine?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.367
Do you think I would be here if it wasn't?

05:26.910 --> 05:28.287
It was an accident.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.080
I have moved past it. So should you.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.582
I will. Thank you.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.293
Hold on.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.045
It's fine. There's just a bit
of a knack to it. And--

05:37.546 --> 05:39.214
- If I could--
- No, don't try to help me.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.842
I need to learn to live like this.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.224
That is lovely tea.

05:49.224 --> 05:50.767
You're such a dick.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.694
<i>Hi. This is Danny. Yeah.
I was gonna do, like, a fun,</i>

06:00.694 --> 06:03.572
<i>jokey kinda message, but I couldn't really
think of one. So, yeah.</i>

06:03.572 --> 06:06.033
<i>So, I-- just leave me a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

06:06.533 --> 06:07.826
Hi.

06:07.826 --> 06:11.747
You still up? I am, obviously.

06:14.166 --> 06:18.003
I was just thinking
this is probably the longest we have gone

06:18.587 --> 06:20.380
without speaking since--

06:21.215 --> 06:22.216
I mean--

06:24.134 --> 06:26.595
Since ever.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.515
So, yeah. Give me a call.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.854
Look, I know the other night
was a big deal.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.981
You leaving the flat for me.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.442
Thank you. You're so sweet.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.905
Would you just let me know you're okay?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.074
I don't--
I'm just a bit worried about you.

06:47.699 --> 06:51.328
Okay. Thank you. Bye, Danny.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.838
Oh, God, I don't need this tonight.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.883
- Have you looked in the box?
- I'm looking.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.553
- Yes, but have you looked properly?
- I'm going through every single box.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.680
I mean, who puts passports
in a storage unit?

07:09.680 --> 07:11.932
Just shut up and help me look, will you?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.642
You really are a useless bastard.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.686
Never get married.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.729
You joking?

07:19.815 --> 07:21.650
What do you mean all my stuff's gone?

07:22.943 --> 07:25.529
Look, Freddie, you're being paranoid.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.866
What were you trying to suggest?

07:29.366 --> 07:31.869
That I'm moving out of the flat in stages
so you won't notice?

07:35.163 --> 07:37.791
Here, kitty, kitty.
What have I got here, hey?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.627
Don't suppose
you've seen a cat knocking about?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.130
Cat? No, sorry.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.508
Little blighter's been going from
unit to unit destroying people's stuff.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.094
I almost had it earlier,
but it managed to wriggle away.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.846
Poor little thing must be trapped in here.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.014
I bet it's terrified.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.808
Yeah, yeah. Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

07:56.602 --> 07:58.854
Right, well. I'd better get on.

08:00.689 --> 08:05.402
Here, kitty, kitty. Come out now,
and that will be the end of it.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.259
Bloody hell.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.928
Would you stop doing that?

08:36.099 --> 08:36.975
Okay.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.154
What? Are you back there?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.494
Oh, my God.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.329
Hi, mate.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.585
Hello.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.713
I wish I could take you home.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.298
Poppy would love a cat.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.301
Veggie's allergic. Sorry.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.470
Hello, mate.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.932
Okay. Stay safe out there, all right?

09:21.687 --> 09:22.813
Oh, my God.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.613
Discman.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.869
Wow.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.540
Lisa Osgood is good.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.001
- <i>Jurassic Park</i>.
- 1993.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.586
<i>Jurassic Park 2</i>.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.796
It doesn't just have to be
<i>Jurassic Park</i> films.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.256
You do not know?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.340
1997.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.676
- Yes, yes. You are.
- He's good. Pretty.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.387
You are good
at knowing when movies came out.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.597
- I know. Not bad.
- Yeah.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.183
But I'm gonna find one
that you don't know.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.768
- I'm bringing you down.
- I love it. Fighting talk.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.854
Go on, hit me with another one.

10:03.854 --> 10:07.191
- <i>The Land Before Time</i>. Difficult.
- Yeah. It's a film.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.151
Do you know?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.862
- Yes, I could find out.
- So do I know?

10:11.862 --> 10:13.238
- You do know?
- Aye, so do I know.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.073
We'll say it at the same time
and see if we both know it.

10:15.073 --> 10:19.286
- Yes. 1988!
- 1988!

10:19.286 --> 10:22.039
That's it. We both win. Game over.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.540
- Jammie Dodger!
- Jammie Dodger in.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.584
We should have another one
'cause they're going stale.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.172
Oh, my God. I totally forgot
about this one.

10:31.381 --> 10:35.844
Danny, sorry for the voice note,
but I just found my old teenage diary.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.971
Listen to this, right.
"Sleepover at Jess's.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.432
We watched <i>The Ring</i>, properly freaked out.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.100
Jess gets up in the middle of the night.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.103
I'm in the hallway sleepwalking."

10:45.938 --> 10:47.105
Always an insomniac.

10:47.105 --> 10:51.276
"She thinks I'm the girl in <i>The Ring</i>,
so she takes a plate off the wall

10:51.276 --> 10:54.571
and chucks it at my head
and wakes up the whole house."

10:57.032 --> 10:58.617
Oh, my God, what's this?

10:58.617 --> 11:02.579
"Ended up having lunch
on my own in the library again and..."

11:04.248 --> 11:06.333
Yeah. That one's not so much fun.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.721
Where are you?

11:21.431 --> 11:24.643
<i>Thanks to the natural buoyancy
of Angus's fur,</i>

11:24.643 --> 11:26.562
<i>drowning is out of the equation.</i>

11:27.980 --> 11:31.191
<i>Sea otters have
the thickest coats of any animal.</i>

11:31.191 --> 11:33.819
- Leese?
- Hi, Adam. Sorry to bother you.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.279
I was just wondering--

11:35.279 --> 11:38.323
Did you know sea otters
have pockets under their arms?

11:38.323 --> 11:39.408
What?

11:39.408 --> 11:42.744
Like, they're not wearing a jacket.
They're, like, built into their skin.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.081
Okay. Cool.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.334
Look, Adam, have you heard from Danny?
It's just, I haven't spoken to him

11:49.334 --> 11:51.587
<i>for about a week, and I'm starting
to get a little bit worried.</i>

11:51.587 --> 11:53.088
What do you think they keep in them?

11:53.088 --> 11:55.257
I don't know. Sorry.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.384
Look, forget about the sea otters
for just a second.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.677
Well, I wish I could.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.972
<i>Can I ask you a tiny favor?</i>

12:04.224 --> 12:05.559
- Adam?
- Yes?

12:38.675 --> 12:41.220
So just to confirm,
you definitely want to do this again?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.056
You're a weird little dude, aren't you?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.140
It has been said.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.560
Maybe we could try
that Italian place I was talking about.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.812
I mean, if it's not too far.
I do know it's difficult for you.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.105
No, no. It's not difficult.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.025
No, I mean, it is. But I'd like to try.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.109
Yay.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.281
Well, I'm glad
I got you to the door safely.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.116
My hero.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.121
Adam? What are you doing on the floor?

13:09.665 --> 13:11.917
Danny. You're okay.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.961
We were worried about you.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.631
- Who was?
- You know, just everyone.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.007
- People.
- People?

13:19.007 --> 13:21.009
What's happening here? What's this?

13:23.220 --> 13:24.221
Can't.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.181
Can't what?

13:27.724 --> 13:29.309
I'm not allowed to tell you.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.061
You're not allowed to tell us what?

13:31.061 --> 13:33.063
- Nothing.
- You're not allowed to tell us nothing?

13:36.191 --> 13:37.860
Yeah, I'm sorry, Leese. I can't do this.

13:37.860 --> 13:38.944
Lisa?

13:39.611 --> 13:40.612
Of course.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.490
<i>Hi, Danny.</i>

13:44.074 --> 13:45.742
<i>God, this is weird, isn't it?</i>

13:46.410 --> 13:47.703
Yeah, you're telling me.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.748
Hi, I'm Amy. You must be Lisa.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.875
Hi--

13:53.458 --> 13:55.127
Wait, Amy, as in...

13:55.127 --> 13:56.253
As in...

13:58.255 --> 14:00.048
I'm sorry to interrupt.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.758
What's going on? What is this?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.137
<i>Sorry. Are you asking me that?</i>

14:06.555 --> 14:07.931
Look, I should go.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.392
- Oh, no-- That came quick.
- My cab will be here in a minute.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.768
<i>Yes. Fast.</i>

14:11.768 --> 14:14.146
Listen, tell her this isn't what--
this isn't a thing that we do.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.981
- This doesn't usually happen.
- It really doesn't.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.274
It's fine.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.943
Rebecca De Mornay is dead.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.199
Were you a big fan?

14:25.199 --> 14:29.745
She was my oldest cat.
You were disrupting her memorial service.

14:34.082 --> 14:37.169
We were 47 seconds
into the minute silence.

14:37.169 --> 14:41.340
So if we could still be quiet
for the next 13 seconds,

14:41.340 --> 14:43.050
we can move on to the eulogy.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.188
- That's my cab.
- Guess you gotta go.

14:56.188 --> 14:59.149
- I've gotta go. Speak to you tomorrow.
- Yeah. We'll have a little chat. Possibly.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.738
<i>Danny, Danny, wait.
I can explain. I'm really--</i>

15:05.781 --> 15:06.698
No.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.954
Okay.
If everyone's quite finished, resume.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.507
Right.

15:29.263 --> 15:30.472
Hi, there.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.684
I'm sorry, I can't take you with me.

15:37.688 --> 15:38.689
Actually...

15:40.274 --> 15:43.360
I think I know someone
that might be able to take care of you.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.281
Yeah.

15:51.994 --> 15:52.995
Perfect.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.752
Damn it.

16:03.755 --> 16:04.965
Right, you.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.011
- Hiya.
- All right?

16:11.889 --> 16:12.973
Did you hear that?

16:13.974 --> 16:14.975
No.

16:18.770 --> 16:19.771
What now?

16:21.440 --> 16:22.441
The lights.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.205
<i>As an adult, Angus will need to eat</i>

16:36.205 --> 16:39.750
<i>up to 40% of his body weight every day...</i>

16:39.750 --> 16:40.959
Forgot something?

16:41.877 --> 16:43.504
- All right?
- Veggie.

16:44.129 --> 16:48.008
Sorry for just turning up. I was out
for a run and somehow ended up here.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.928
- You ran here?
- Actually, I'm running to the moon.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.931
- I think you've taken a wrong turn.
- No. Sorry, no.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.142
I mean, it's about 384,000 miles

16:57.142 --> 16:59.019
from here to the moon. Yeah.

16:59.019 --> 17:01.271
My aim is to run that many miles
by the time I'm 60.

17:02.481 --> 17:03.690
Good. Well, well done.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.652
This is for you.

17:06.652 --> 17:09.363
Like my parents always said, never turn up
at someone's house empty-handed.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.446
Nice. Thanks.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.449
- Would you like a glass?
- Is Lisa here?

17:13.492 --> 17:14.492
What?

17:14.992 --> 17:16.537
Lisa. She's not home.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.623
No, she's not. Sorry. Sorry, no.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.707
Right.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.501
Why? Have you lost her?

17:23.126 --> 17:24.127
Maybe.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.675
Sorry. I just-- I somehow
thought she might have ended up here.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.846
- This is the living room.
- Is that lipstick?

17:33.846 --> 17:35.764
Have I told you about my girlfriend, Amy?

17:35.764 --> 17:37.391
In a very serious relationship.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.142
Both committed, very good.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.562
- Great. Good. Good for you.
- Yeah, nice. She's really nice.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.982
Would you mind if I use your bathroom?

17:46.567 --> 17:47.651
No.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.944
Great. It's through here, is it?

17:48.944 --> 17:51.446
Actually, no, it's not.
It's to the right. Just ar--

17:53.699 --> 17:54.700
Everything okay?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.744
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
The wine is French by the way.

17:59.329 --> 18:02.124
The label says
it goes well with chicken and fish.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.126
I'm not really much of an expert.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.212
But, you know, if you're having
any chicken or fish dishes,

18:07.212 --> 18:09.506
then it should go really well with it.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.465
Right.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.803
Oh, Lisa, she actually got me a Wowcher
to go wine tasting once.

18:15.429 --> 18:18.056
But, unfortunately, I couldn't go
because I had...

18:20.100 --> 18:20.976
gastric flu.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.567
That's-- Good job I checked this actually.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.986
You've got a bit of water leaking
through the tiles here.

18:31.737 --> 18:33.405
Have you had these done recently?

18:34.156 --> 18:35.240
If you've got any grout,

18:35.240 --> 18:36.533
I could fix it for you.

18:42.581 --> 18:43.582
You okay?

18:44.541 --> 18:45.459
Yeah.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.922
It's fresh.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.090
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's French.

18:52.090 --> 18:56.261
- Oh, yeah. You said.
- Yeah, I think they do the freshest.

18:57.137 --> 19:01.475
You know I can't remember
the last time I was up at this time.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.811
Yeah. I can't remember
the last time I wasn't, to be honest.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.523
It's, like, when I'm sleeping,

19:07.523 --> 19:11.276
there's this whole world of Lisa's
that I know nothing about.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.489
Which is fine. 'Cause you know,
it was good when we were awake.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.033
- Was good?
- What?

19:18.033 --> 19:20.494
What? Sorry. You were saying?

19:20.494 --> 19:21.870
No. No, nothing, really.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.330
You sure? Sounded like something.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.874
No. It's fine. I was just--

19:27.835 --> 19:29.461
Would you mind if I did some press-ups?

19:29.962 --> 19:31.630
- What, now?
- Yeah.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.468
That's better. Now I can think.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.512
You should join me.

19:38.512 --> 19:40.389
I would,
but I've got ridiculously weak wrists.

19:41.557 --> 19:45.435
It's just, lately I've been having
all these thoughts.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.981
Yeah, those.
Don't get me started on thoughts.

19:48.981 --> 19:51.608
The bane of my life those.
Along with my weak wrists.

19:52.484 --> 19:56.280
It just feels like Lisa's
pulling away from me a bit.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.952
I don't understand.
I thought you were gonna...

20:02.619 --> 20:03.620
Gonna what?

20:03.620 --> 20:04.997
Well, propose.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.082
Right.

20:20.053 --> 20:22.723
Right. Nearly there, I think.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.019
It's, like,
I'll walk into a room she's in,

20:27.019 --> 20:30.063
and then she makes up some excuse
and just leaves almost immediately.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.648
Right.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.986
She's been trying to get her sleeping back
on track since she went on this hen night.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.948
She took some drugs,
and then she got lost.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.825
And I think it jolted her a little.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.205
And I might have told her that,
you know, she needs to grow up bit

20:46.205 --> 20:47.289
for Poppy's sake.

20:47.956 --> 20:51.668
So, now, you know,
she keeps making all these changes,

20:51.668 --> 20:55.506
but, well, the truth is...

20:57.424 --> 20:59.927
Go on. You know,
if it helps to get it off your chest.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.223
I don't think her heart's in it anymore.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.230
Sorry, mate, I shouldn't have come.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.857
No, don't go. You're so close to 500.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.401
Please don't tell Lisa I was here.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.279
- Okay.
- Thanks.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.575
Veggie, wait.

21:27.663 --> 21:30.207
I don't suppose you've heard "I'll Be
Your Mirror" by The Velvet Underground?

21:31.667 --> 21:32.584
- No.
- Okay.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.087
Well, it's from their first album
released in 1967.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.381
The album's actually called
<i>The Velvet Underground & Nico</i>.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.633
Very fun fact:
Andy Warhol designed the cover.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.345
Sorry, mate.
You've lost me. What you talking about?

21:43.345 --> 21:44.638
Perfectly understandable. Sorry.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.182
It's a love song, okay?

21:47.182 --> 21:49.393
Probably the greatest love song
ever written actually.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.021
And there's a lyric in there which is,
"I'll be your mirror,

21:53.021 --> 21:55.274
reflect what you are
in case you don't know."

21:57.484 --> 21:58.527
You know?

21:59.736 --> 22:02.447
What I'm saying is
we're all trying our best. You know?

22:03.824 --> 22:06.451
Most of our life, we walk around
feeling like we don't fit in.

22:08.036 --> 22:11.039
So, we're just letting people down
just by being who we are.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.042
But all it takes is that one person.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.505
Do you know? To see you.
To really see you...

22:21.091 --> 22:23.427
and decide that they wanna be with you
no matter what.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.476
Alternatively, you could just forget
what I've just said

22:31.476 --> 22:33.103
and, you know, play to your strengths.

22:33.103 --> 22:36.732
Right. And what would they be?
You know, if you had to say.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.483
- What would they-- Right now?
- Yeah.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.112
Well, you look good in shorts.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.157
Well, thank you.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.910
I just feel more myself in them really.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.995
And, boy, can you tell.
Honestly, it's-- Yeah, yeah.

22:49.995 --> 22:52.080
- You look like you were born in them.
- Anything else?

22:52.080 --> 22:55.375
- Sure. You're great with Poppy.
- Yeah.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.003
You've got a steady job, haven't you?
Which is great in this economy.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.796
- You own your own home.
- Good sense of humor?

23:00.881 --> 23:01.965
You own your own home.

23:03.258 --> 23:06.053
And you're Veggie. Most importantly.

23:06.053 --> 23:08.764
You know, there's only one of those,
and he's standing right here.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.477
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.481
Thanks, Danny, for everything.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.607
That's okay. Of course.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.777
Okay. Hug. That's okay.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.324
"I'll-- I'll Be Your Mirror"?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.409
Uh-huh. That's the one.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.286
Cheers.

23:50.973 --> 23:54.977
Now, you're probably going to think
your new owner is a total weirdo, okay?

23:55.519 --> 23:57.938
I just want you to know
that that is normal, okay?

23:57.938 --> 23:59.565
You'll get used to him,

23:59.565 --> 24:03.402
and I don't think there's anyone else who
can take care of you as well as he can.

24:03.402 --> 24:04.987
So you just have to trust me.

24:04.987 --> 24:08.282
But if you really, really need a break,
you can go across the hall to Danny.

24:08.282 --> 24:11.285
Because honestly,
Danny is just the most ama--

24:16.665 --> 24:19.459
- Lisa.
- Veg.
