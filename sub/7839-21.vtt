01:32.730 --> 01:36.148
Welcome to the matinee of 
love and commercials.

01:36.283 --> 01:38.800
Hi, I'm your hostess Boobarella,

01:39.001 --> 01:42.813
I hope you'll enjoy our labour 
day marathon of murder

01:42.916 --> 01:45.726
because soon you'll have 
to go back to school.

01:45.782 --> 01:47.774
School!!!

01:47.822 --> 01:50.666
School? My god I wasted the whole summer.

01:50.726 --> 01:52.890
They're so many things I still want to do.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.661
You think you're behind?

02:10.389 --> 02:11.763
Win baseball game.

02:14.037 --> 02:17.951
Now Simpsons be careful, their kid 
pitcher's mount is really 22.

02:47.922 --> 02:50.128
Son, do you have time for the pizza party?

02:50.368 --> 02:51.274
Sure. Why not?

03:10.778 --> 03:14.408
That's Grease!

03:14.505 --> 03:15.902
Sit on it, Springfield!

03:26.806 --> 03:28.770
Get outta my face, you raggedy maggots!

03:28.915 --> 03:32.711
So that's why everyone's been 
saying that all summer.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.042
No, not yet.

03:36.075 --> 03:37.500
I have to have a summer romance.

03:41.706 --> 03:43.533
I'll never forget you.

03:45.975 --> 03:46.811
Gotta go.

03:52.337 --> 03:54.282
I just had my first kiss.

03:54.495 --> 03:57.222
When you get to third base, 
I'll buy you a beer.

04:00.925 --> 04:03.272
Well, now it's time 
for my summer activity.

04:03.308 --> 04:05.163
You all promised we 
could go to a museum.

04:10.967 --> 04:14.201
I'm so glad you picked the 
museum of natural history, mom.

04:14.325 --> 04:17.110
Well, I'm so glad there's a 
show we women can enjoy.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.160
Weaving? Homer, you're my father.

04:23.206 --> 04:25.290
You're supposed to protect me 
from things like this.

04:25.367 --> 04:29.663
All right. Just this once, you can take 
a drink out of my special water bottle.

04:38.148 --> 04:38.870
what?!

04:39.186 --> 04:40.470
Sorry, loom-wads.

04:40.516 --> 04:41.640
New exhibit's in town.

04:42.965 --> 04:44.160
Weapons!

04:44.265 --> 04:46.111
Bart, it's still history.

04:46.196 --> 04:48.831
Not if I spend the whole time 
running around like this.

04:51.608 --> 04:53.070
Die, weapons, die!

04:53.158 --> 04:55.060
Don't start the exhibit without me!

04:57.108 --> 04:59.161
Look at that line!

05:01.037 --> 05:05.080
Time to do what I do best, 
ruin it for everybody.

05:06.548 --> 05:08.730
Hey, Flanders, thanks for saving our place.

05:08.806 --> 05:11.010
But, wait, wait. Ho...
hold the phone there, Homer.

05:11.206 --> 05:13.111
Dude, I was totally here.

05:13.196 --> 05:15.801
You calling me a liar in front of my kids?

05:15.865 --> 05:18.821
'Cause I'd take a bullet for 
you, man, right in the mouth!

05:20.576 --> 05:22.560
Fine. Take the cut.

05:22.706 --> 05:25.322
Ned Flanders is doling out cuts.

05:25.428 --> 05:28.213
I, for one, wish to partake of said!

05:29.346 --> 05:32.670
Hey, if boner here is gettin' 
cuts, I want 'em, too.

05:33.187 --> 05:33.981
Cuts?

05:34.118 --> 05:36.071
I want cuts!

05:36.117 --> 05:38.600
Disco Stu slides in front of you!

05:39.228 --> 05:40.331
That rhymes.

05:44.268 --> 05:45.091
Tell you what.

05:45.198 --> 05:48.170
If we turn around, it will feel like 
we're at the front of the line!

05:49.187 --> 05:51.443
Oh, no, you don't!

05:52.175 --> 05:53.223
I'm everywhere.

05:55.526 --> 06:01.551
Imax 3-d films presents: 
The nunchuck cool but useless

06:02.035 --> 06:06.180
nunchuck was inventedthousands 
of years ago by a chinese monk.

06:06.957 --> 06:11.233
Artifacts of the time indicate 
that this incident was hilarious.

06:16.165 --> 06:19.251
Wow! This 3-D is amazing!

06:19.317 --> 06:21.520
You can actually feel the vase!

06:22.958 --> 06:24.442
Go ahead, Maggie.

06:24.447 --> 06:26.683
You're allowed to touch the deadly weapons.

06:30.565 --> 06:31.663
It's a mugger!

06:31.765 --> 06:34.310
I'll hand over all my hugs and kisses.

06:35.355 --> 06:36.381
Okay, be cool.

06:36.448 --> 06:38.412
I've got some candy in my purse.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.165
Stop!

06:52.165 --> 06:53.102
Come on, Milhouse.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.040
Do you want to play in the NBA or not?

06:55.157 --> 06:57.693
Bart, my arm's out of its thing.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.663
That means it's working.

07:06.867 --> 07:08.110
Whazzup?

07:08.737 --> 07:10.390
You're leaving already?

07:10.438 --> 07:12.291
We... we haven't even gotten in yet.

07:12.356 --> 07:15.902
Sorry, Flanders, but when you get in, 
you can use my audio tour.

07:16.025 --> 07:18.342
It's narrated by Melanie Griffith.

07:19.868 --> 07:21.052
This room's nice.

07:21.447 --> 07:22.842
Let's go in to the next one.

07:22.997 --> 07:24.522
This room's nice, too.

07:25.937 --> 07:27.001
this room's nice.

07:27.357 --> 07:28.563
This room's nice, too.

07:29.426 --> 07:30.690
This room's nice, too.

07:31.108 --> 07:32.112
This room's nice.

07:32.538 --> 07:33.571
This room's nice.

07:33.908 --> 07:35.370
This room's nice, too.

07:37.445 --> 07:40.980
Sorry, folks, the weapons exhibit 
is now closed for the day.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.143
Sorry, no yay.

07:43.317 --> 07:46.340
But you can all feel free to 
enjoy the rest of the museum.

07:50.645 --> 07:51.743
Evolution?

08:00.626 --> 08:02.020
Excuse me.

08:02.146 --> 08:04.472
How can you put up an 
exhibit on the origin of

08:04.526 --> 08:06.712
man and not have one 
mention of the bible?

08:06.975 --> 08:07.620
We do.

08:09.895 --> 08:14.581
What a fool believes...

08:17.115 --> 08:19.681
my most cherished beliefs, a myth?

08:19.896 --> 08:21.610
Daddy, was mommy a monkey?

08:21.655 --> 08:22.943
I can't remember.

08:22.986 --> 08:24.851
No one was ever a monkey!

08:24.877 --> 08:26.920
Everything is what it was and always will be!

08:26.936 --> 08:28.683
God put us here and that's that.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.623
But you said a stork brought me.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.691
That was god disguised as a stork.

08:33.788 --> 08:35.350
Who brings baby storks?

08:35.356 --> 08:37.063
There's no such thing as storks!

08:37.095 --> 08:38.011
It's all god.

08:38.898 --> 08:40.470
Please bless daddy and mommy....

08:40.506 --> 08:42.561
stop praying to that stork!

08:46.155 --> 08:49.393
They're telling people we're 
descended from a pack of apes.

08:49.455 --> 08:51.511
Even though there's nothing 
about it in the bible.

08:51.626 --> 08:54.080
Ned, you've got to take this 
thing with a grain of salt.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.011
I mean, come on.

08:56.165 --> 08:59.731
Tim, this controversy could 
put more meat in the seats.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.901
Well... our membership has been dwindling

09:02.958 --> 09:06.381
since those episcopalians 
put in those vibrating pews.

09:10.428 --> 09:12.313
Evolution is the hot-button issue.

09:12.338 --> 09:14.091
We need to mobilize our flock.

09:14.116 --> 09:16.330
They'll be hanging on your every word.

09:16.486 --> 09:19.042
I'll be a white Al Sharpton.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.870
Why does every church 
meeting end this way?

09:27.955 --> 09:31.791
We want you to teach alternative 
theories to Darwinian evolution.

09:31.986 --> 09:33.931
You mean lamarckian evolution?

09:34.107 --> 09:36.393
No, the Adam and Eve one.

09:36.656 --> 09:38.133
And what if I say no?

09:38.316 --> 09:41.943
I believe you leased your Camry 
from christian brothers auto.

09:42.105 --> 09:44.971
No! That was a once-in-a-lifetime APR!

09:45.005 --> 09:47.180
Class, starting today, we will be presenting

09:47.227 --> 09:49.660
an alternative theory on the origin of man.

09:53.075 --> 09:54.151
Creationism?!

09:54.525 --> 09:55.671
But that's not science.

09:56.187 --> 09:56.950
It is now.

09:57.035 --> 09:58.970
Are oceans god's tears?

10:02.305 --> 10:03.500
They sure are.

10:03.588 --> 10:04.663
A-plus.

10:05.895 --> 10:07.841
Now Lisa's the Ralph.

10:08.927 --> 10:12.663
How can you teach the book of 
genesis as a scientific theory?

10:13.366 --> 10:15.573
This helpful video will 
evade all your questions.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.242
Eyes screenward.

10:23.575 --> 10:25.443
Let's say hi to two books.

10:25.695 --> 10:28.811
One, the bible, was written by our lord.

10:32.235 --> 10:34.911
The other, "the origin of species,"

10:34.968 --> 10:38.410
was written by a cowardly 
drunk named charles Darwin.

10:42.407 --> 10:43.562
This is slander.

10:43.622 --> 10:46.358
Darwin was one of the 
greatest minds of all time.

10:46.468 --> 10:49.094
Then why is he making out with satan?

10:51.908 --> 10:55.228
Evolution is widely 
acknowledged as scientific fact.

10:55.426 --> 10:57.760
It's even accepted by 
prominent conservatives

10:57.817 --> 11:00.662
like George will and the 
late pope John Paul.

11:01.485 --> 11:03.081
That's something to think about.

11:03.127 --> 11:04.560
The George will?

11:04.875 --> 11:06.521
Lisa, you've said quite enough.

11:06.686 --> 11:08.940
Children, drown her out with 
whistling and arm flatulence.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.603
All I'm saying is...

11:24.146 --> 11:25.662
What's wrong, sweetie?

11:25.788 --> 11:28.780
They're making us learn 
creation theory in school.

11:28.997 --> 11:32.623
Today we had a test, and 
every answer was "god did it."

11:33.156 --> 11:37.052
Well, I think it's good to 
give both ideas a fair hearing.

11:37.156 --> 11:38.740
Maybe they could learn from each other.

11:38.787 --> 11:41.033
But they're incompatible!

11:41.108 --> 11:45.770
Lisa, lots of times two incompatible 
things can both be true.

11:45.858 --> 11:49.501
My son's a brat, but 
he's a special little guy.

11:49.646 --> 11:53.491
You father says he's at work, but 
there he is jumping on a trampoline.

11:54.727 --> 11:58.812
Mom, you really have to choose 
here between science and belief.

12:03.847 --> 12:06.242
Well, then I choose...

12:15.916 --> 12:19.391
so, according to creationism, 
there were no cavemen.

12:19.495 --> 12:20.391
Good riddance.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.481
Their drawings suck and 
they look like hippies.

12:22.568 --> 12:25.771
Dad, you're not really 
reconsidering evolution, are you?

12:25.925 --> 12:28.713
My mind is always open to new ideas.

12:29.067 --> 12:29.653
Onions?!

12:29.817 --> 12:30.680
In the peas?!

12:30.797 --> 12:32.033
What the hell!

12:36.807 --> 12:37.813
It is agreed...

12:38.046 --> 12:40.601
regular people can park 
in handicapped spaces

12:40.836 --> 12:43.070
if they're just running in to buy smokes

12:43.276 --> 12:45.642
or maybe some pop tarts for tomorrow.

12:45.915 --> 12:47.390
The system works.

12:47.468 --> 12:49.642
And if there's no further business,

12:49.757 --> 12:52.951
I hereby declare this meeting...

12:53.026 --> 12:54.570
I have an issue I'd like to raise.

12:54.646 --> 12:56.352
Curse my slow gaveling.

12:56.386 --> 12:59.622
Last week, the unscientific 
theory of creationism

12:59.698 --> 13:03.752
was introduced alongside evolution 
in Springfield public schools.

13:04.766 --> 13:09.022
Now, honestly, the bible's about the 
same age as, the rest of our textbooks.

13:11.195 --> 13:14.572
Evolution and creationism 
cannot coexist, people.

13:14.726 --> 13:17.340
It is time to go back to 
teaching one single truth.

13:17.448 --> 13:20.352
Homer's son's sister's right.

13:23.195 --> 13:24.931
Class, the town has spoken.

13:25.027 --> 13:27.641
From now on we're only teaching one theory...

13:27.666 --> 13:28.643
creationism.

13:28.858 --> 13:31.961
Now please hand in your evolution 
books to groundskeeper Willie

13:32.137 --> 13:33.992
while I beat this ominous drum.

13:42.695 --> 13:44.950
There seems to be a note on your locker!

13:45.106 --> 13:46.993
From a secret admirer, perhaps.

13:47.657 --> 13:48.771
Don't make me laugh.

13:50.405 --> 13:52.133
"Dear seekers of truth:

13:52.377 --> 13:55.931
"Meet in the school's single-purpose 
room tomorrow at lunch.

13:56.128 --> 13:59.263
"Rationally yours, L.M.S."

13:59.576 --> 14:00.451
"L.M.S."

14:00.527 --> 14:01.852
Who could it be?

14:08.337 --> 14:09.512
Little Moe Szyslak?

14:10.405 --> 14:11.661
Why does everybody call me that?

14:11.955 --> 14:13.711
Bunch of snot-faced pukebags.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.862
I'm so glad you could all come.

14:24.915 --> 14:29.510
I will be reading to you from the 
original of species by Charles Darwin.

14:30.505 --> 14:32.842
I thought we're gonna light spiders on fire.

14:33.576 --> 14:34.540
We're over here.

14:39.518 --> 14:40.701
You all have a nice day.

14:43.697 --> 14:46.111
"Chapter one: When we compare the individuals

14:46.146 --> 14:47.201
"of the same variety

14:47.246 --> 14:50.793
"or sub-variety of our older 
cultivated plants and animals..."

14:52.067 --> 14:53.763
Lisa Simpson, you're under arrest

14:53.826 --> 14:56.230
for the teaching of non-biblical science!

14:58.465 --> 15:03.101
There are so many worse crimes. 
Why are you persecuting me?

15:03.177 --> 15:06.751
We only have the manpower to 
enforce the last law passed.

15:06.808 --> 15:08.330
You know, it's not the best system, but...

15:08.587 --> 15:10.592
well, in fact, it's...
it's pretty much the worst.

15:12.726 --> 15:14.272
you live! You die!

15:14.878 --> 15:16.423
You live! You die!

15:18.135 --> 15:20.173
In the old days, we would've 
been all over that.

15:24.308 --> 15:26.662
This is Kent Brockman, reporting 
live from the trial

15:26.748 --> 15:28.530
of god vs. Lisa Simpson.

15:28.746 --> 15:32.340
Defending miss Simpson is aclu-appointed 
liberal, Clarisse Drummond.

15:32.447 --> 15:33.381
I'm from new york!

15:35.006 --> 15:37.192
And prosecuting the case against Lisa

15:37.208 --> 15:40.142
is humble country lawyer Wallace Brady.

15:40.386 --> 15:42.143
As the little chicken said to his mama,

15:42.346 --> 15:43.721
"I just hope I don't 'cluck up.'"

15:45.395 --> 15:48.131
I think it's fair to say 
if that man doesn't win,

15:48.378 --> 15:50.022
I'm resigning from the jury.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.182
This is Kent Brockman, juror 
number seven, saying,

15:53.627 --> 15:55.182
"I'll have the roast beef for lunch."

15:57.256 --> 16:01.282
So does this theory of evolution 
necessarily mean that there is no god?

16:01.435 --> 16:02.340
No, of course not.

16:03.737 --> 16:07.481
It just says that god is an 
impotent nothing from nowhere

16:07.516 --> 16:10.113
with less power than the 
undersecretary of agriculture,

16:10.155 --> 16:12.500
who has very little power in our system.

16:17.195 --> 16:19.761
Now, sir, you are a scientist, correct?

16:20.147 --> 16:24.003
That's right. I have a phd in 
truthology from christian tech.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.880
Move over, Carl.

16:26.936 --> 16:27.822
I got a new hero!

16:28.186 --> 16:29.750
Yeah, this'll last about a day.

16:30.268 --> 16:34.490
So, as a scientist, what is your 
take on this "devil-ution"?

16:35.767 --> 16:36.571
Pure hogwash.

16:36.866 --> 16:38.991
If man evolved from monkeys, 
there'd be evidence.

16:39.117 --> 16:42.051
But when we look at the fossil 
record, here's what we see.

16:42.565 --> 16:44.031
A missing link.

16:47.488 --> 16:50.293
Why, I believe, right now, 
this gentleman's having dinner

16:50.315 --> 16:52.083
with the tooth fairy and the easter bunny.

16:52.425 --> 16:55.272
This is the break in the 
case we've been waiting for!

16:55.505 --> 16:56.790
I mean, he doesn't exist.

16:57.075 --> 16:59.110
Evolution is just a lot 
of that hollywood hooey.

17:03.808 --> 17:05.079
Well, I've heard enough for today.

17:05.477 --> 17:07.452
I have to judge a wet t-shirt 
contest in 20 minutes.

17:07.656 --> 17:10.432
Ah, this trial is the biggest load of...

17:11.088 --> 17:12.463
For crying out loud!

17:12.808 --> 17:16.133
Now. Bambi, who started that 
forest fire that killed your mama?

17:16.906 --> 17:17.913
Evolution?!

17:18.358 --> 17:20.093
My, my, my.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.721
Poor bambi.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.663
Poor thumper...

17:30.667 --> 17:32.103
I'm sorry, mom.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.901
I should have just gone with 
the flow, like you said.

17:42.826 --> 17:45.463
Well, I might as well see 
what all the fuss is about.

17:56.716 --> 17:58.093
Homer, Homer, please.

17:58.456 --> 17:59.913
I love it when you're not into it.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.663
Oh, yeah, baby, mmm...

18:02.278 --> 18:03.141
That's it, ignore me.

18:03.307 --> 18:04.390
I'm not even here.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.573
Wow, Darwin's argument 
is incredibly persuasive,

18:09.747 --> 18:13.513
and his ship was the beagle, which 
reminds me of snoopy, my favorite peanut!

18:17.008 --> 18:20.283
Lisa, I thinI have a way to 
help you at the trial today.

18:20.656 --> 18:21.242
So do I!

18:22.868 --> 18:25.332
Milhouse will serve the time 
for you while you flee to Mexico.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.800
Your new name: Senorita Ugly.

18:28.545 --> 18:31.591
Honey, I appreciate the thought, 
but just leave everything to me.

18:32.905 --> 18:35.030
You can take off the wig, Mihouse.

18:35.225 --> 18:36.181
I'm Nelson!

18:46.245 --> 18:48.993
Now, Mr. Flanders, you're 
familiar with the bible, correct?

18:49.287 --> 18:51.521
As familiar as it's proper to be.

18:51.996 --> 18:53.053
Don't worry, Lisa.

18:53.347 --> 18:55.901
I've got the answer to 
your problems right here.

18:57.146 --> 18:59.531
Look, Homie, I brought you a beer.

18:59.685 --> 19:00.700
Thanks, Marge.

19:02.776 --> 19:03.710
It's not a twist-off!

19:05.108 --> 19:05.581
Come on!

19:09.195 --> 19:12.373
And you are positive that 
man and ape cannot be related?

19:12.587 --> 19:15.303
As sure as I am that Jesus hates hip-hop!

19:15.385 --> 19:16.733
Come on! Open!

19:16.885 --> 19:18.731
I want what's in you!

19:21.495 --> 19:21.930
As a matter...

19:21.935 --> 19:22.850
I want... you...

19:22.855 --> 19:23.352
Homer...

19:23.356 --> 19:23.721
stupid...

19:25.438 --> 19:26.261
Homer, I'm trying to...

19:29.947 --> 19:32.563
will you shut your yap, you 
big monkey-faced gorilla!

19:34.066 --> 19:36.351
Mr. Flanders, you've sworn 
to tell the truth.

19:36.638 --> 19:39.842
Can you say that this man could not 
possibly be related to that ape?

19:43.016 --> 19:43.781
You win, Lisa.

19:44.388 --> 19:46.110
This court hereby rules that the law

19:46.186 --> 19:48.771
forbidding the teaching 
of evolution is repealed.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.231
Wait, it was a twist-off.

19:55.826 --> 19:56.791
Thanks, mom.

19:57.186 --> 19:59.832
Thank you, honey, for opening my eyes.

20:00.088 --> 20:02.762
I can't wait to see what 
evolution will make next.

20:02.956 --> 20:06.710
Maybe a bird with a people 
face or a bear with pants on!

20:07.005 --> 20:08.271
Let's go, boys.

20:08.427 --> 20:10.163
Your poor old popsicle's been licked.

20:10.207 --> 20:11.371
Mr. Flanders, wait!

20:12.185 --> 20:14.611
I want you to know, 
I respect your beliefs,

20:14.666 --> 20:16.722
and I can see how deeply you feel about them.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.631
I just don't think religion 
should be taught in our schools,

20:19.728 --> 20:22.870
any more than you'd want 
scientist teaching at the church.

20:23.365 --> 20:26.072
Well, i wish this world 
would evolve a few more

20:26.137 --> 20:27.250
kids like you, Lisa.

20:27.665 --> 20:32.021
What say we take our worthy 
adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?

20:32.337 --> 20:33.711
Cram it, ya god wad.

20:33.885 --> 20:34.741
You... whaa...?

20:35.305 --> 20:41.232
