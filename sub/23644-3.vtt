WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:13.178
I heard deadly intentions.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.015
He's, like, really getting mad.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.050
I don't feel comfortable.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.119
I see blood just flowing.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.523
I feel like almost being
buried alive.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.026
There were people just buried
randomly around here.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.994
It's like a huge
avalanche of gravel

00:28.996 --> 00:30.729
that just came down
on these kids.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.065
They want me out.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.134
I'm in
a lot of pain.

00:36.303 --> 00:39.171
Panic, panic, panic.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.739
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.541
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.878
The house just feels <i> bad.</i>

00:45.880 --> 00:47.146
I see dead people.

00:47.148 --> 00:51.517
This man
is <i> completely</i> insane.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.686
I speak to dead people...

00:54.688 --> 00:56.855
Whoo. Okay.
She doesn't like it in there.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.857
...and they speak to me.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.893
He likes to twist that knife.

01:00.895 --> 01:04.396
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:04.397 --> 01:08.033
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.601
I rely on my partner.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.136
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.439
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.074
Now does he die right there,
on the spot?

01:15.076 --> 01:19.011
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:19.013 --> 01:21.647
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.515
It's my job to reveal them.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.818
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:25.820 --> 01:27.719
But Steve and I never speak...

01:27.721 --> 01:29.755
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.090
...until the very end.

01:31.092 --> 01:33.258
I'm as stunned as you guys are.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.194
When we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

01:35.196 --> 01:37.863
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.298
Or time to get out.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.634
His goal
is to kill you guys.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:55.483 --> 01:57.816
I'm in the small town
of New Franken, Wisconsin,

01:57.818 --> 02:00.219
just 15 minutes east
of Green Bay.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.054
I got a call from a woman
named Kelli.

02:02.056 --> 02:05.691
Now she spent the last 2 years
<i> and</i> her life savings

02:05.693 --> 02:08.460
converting an old house
into her dream business.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.828
Now here's where the trouble is.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.230
The activity is so bad,

02:11.232 --> 02:13.432
she doesn't think it's safe
for anybody to be there,

02:13.434 --> 02:15.100
and if we can't help her,

02:15.102 --> 02:17.636
she's gonna have to
close her doors and walk away.

02:20.241 --> 02:24.476
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.845
This place has a lot of unique
and unusual items

02:26.847 --> 02:29.915
that could influence
her findings,

02:29.917 --> 02:32.918
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.620
When I'm done,

02:34.622 --> 02:37.389
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.935
I don't like this.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.137
Right away, there's warnings,

02:52.139 --> 02:54.439
warning after warning
after warning.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.912
God. There's not good energy
in this damn place.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.181
No. Mnh-mnh.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.287
So there's something
with the land here.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.456
There were people probably just
buried randomly around here.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.128
These people are not at rest.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.430
It attracts bad people.

03:18.432 --> 03:22.100
You got to be a seedy...
to thrive on this land.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.209
Kelli, when we spoke
on the phone, you sounded upset.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.377
- What's going on?
- First of all, I am

03:32.379 --> 03:35.314
extremely, extremely thankful
that you're here.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.950
I mean, our dream
is literally crumbling.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.151
Whatever entity is here,

03:39.153 --> 03:41.220
I get the feeling
it doesn't want us here.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.421
You used to live here.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.989
- Correct.
- For how long?

03:43.991 --> 03:45.591
About 12 years.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.993
So when you guys lived in
the house, who all lived here?

03:47.995 --> 03:50.829
It was me and my husband
and my four children.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.699
Okay.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.802
So when you guys were living
here, did you have any activity?

03:56.804 --> 03:58.637
We did have some,
but it was nothing

03:58.639 --> 04:00.806
that was real concerning
or serious.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.207
It didn't get that way
until we started

04:02.209 --> 04:03.442
renovating for the business.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.010
Is it a family business?
What's the story?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.479
Yes and no. My husband
is supportive of me,

04:07.481 --> 04:09.748
but it's really me
and my business partner.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.483
Okay. And who's
your business partner?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.719
- Her name is Kelly as well.
- Okay.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.088
What kind of business
do you guys want to open?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.457
An alternative healing
business,

04:18.459 --> 04:22.361
reiki energy healing
and a holistic cafe.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.063
But overwhelming sense I get
is that whatever is here

04:25.065 --> 04:26.865
doesn't want us to
help people.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.166
Okay.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.435
It sounds like the kind of place
my partner would like.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.037
You know, Kelli,
not for nothing,

04:32.039 --> 04:34.106
but this place doesn't really
look like it's ready to open.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.141
I mean, that's one of
the main reasons we need you.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.510
We have tried really hard
to get it off the ground,

04:38.512 --> 04:40.112
but every time we come
over here to work,

04:40.114 --> 04:41.880
the activity goes insane,
and we have to leave.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.682
So what do you think
started it?

04:43.684 --> 04:46.418
It started when
we tore down the walls,

04:46.420 --> 04:51.823
and we found tons and tons
and tons of stuff in the walls.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.892
So you found all this crap
behind the walls?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.260
Yes.

04:55.262 --> 04:58.130
And everything got 10 times,
20 times, 100 times worse.

04:58.132 --> 05:01.033
Give me a list of experiences
you guys are having.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.969
A lot of footsteps
and voices.
Okay.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.806
Shadow figures,
personality changes,

05:07.808 --> 05:10.142
and now it's become
physically violent.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.544
So when you say "personality
changes," what do you mean?

05:12.546 --> 05:15.213
It seems
to be over the top.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.049
When you get mad,
you get really mad.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.383
When you get sad,
you get depressed.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.185
And for me,
that is not normal.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.353
What if Amy did tell you,

05:21.355 --> 05:23.155
"Listen, you gotta walk away
from this place.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.990
It's never gonna be able
to get fixed"?

05:24.992 --> 05:28.060
Just the idea of walking away
is heartbreaking.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.862
I've put everything
into this.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.368
There's some dead dude
with me.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.737
He doesn't want me here.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.741
He keeps trying to...

05:42.743 --> 05:44.343
confuse me.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.777
What sort of stuff
was he doing?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.879
He was trying to block me.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.716
Like, jumbling up my...

05:50.718 --> 05:52.584
thoughts.

05:52.586 --> 05:56.688
He is not good.

05:56.690 --> 06:01.059
He said he'll hurt me,
poking me in the eye.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.328
I'm in a lot of pain.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.972
I don't think
that it's a good idea to...

06:13.974 --> 06:16.408
go down there.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.385
All right,
so what's going on down here?

06:26.387 --> 06:30.422
The most pronounced thing
that bothers me is depression.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.225
As soon as I come downstairs,
I start feeling heavy.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.560
- Are you feeling that right now?
- For sure.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.896
I feel like almost being
buried alive.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.831
I don't stay down here
long, ever.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.666
Okay. So anything else?

06:41.668 --> 06:43.001
The next thing
that comes to mind --

06:43.003 --> 06:44.770
in my office, in the very
back corner of the house,

06:44.772 --> 06:49.207
I saw a distinct solid,
dark gray, black-ish shadow.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.342
So anything else?

06:50.344 --> 06:52.911
When I lived here,
I started randomly getting

06:52.913 --> 06:55.814
very bad body pain --
my ankles, lower body.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.949
Okay. I mean, you lived here
a long time.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.950
What makes you think
it's paranormal?

06:58.952 --> 07:00.352
It got better
when I moved out.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.586
Why don't you just
cut your losses,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.054
sell this place, and get
the hell out of here?

07:03.056 --> 07:04.222
My heart is like, "Come on.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.724
There's got to be a way
to make it work."

07:05.726 --> 07:07.726
I want to be able to help
as many people as possible,

07:07.728 --> 07:10.662
and right now,
it's just not possible.

07:13.267 --> 07:17.602
Boy. This is the angry guy's
space down here.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.374
He can instill fear in people,

07:22.376 --> 07:26.011
so maybe making
growling noises, yelling.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.713
"This is all mine. Get away."

07:28.715 --> 07:31.883
He's physically capable
of punching and poking.

07:31.885 --> 07:35.687
I feel drunk and sick.

07:35.689 --> 07:39.524
I'm getting punched
in the kidney area.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.569
Kelly, I was talking
to your partner.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.737
She's got pretty bad things
going on here.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.473
I mean, how about you?

07:54.475 --> 07:57.709
I'm ready to take everything
and leave.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.478
- That bad?
- Yeah.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.181
If we could fix it, make this
place safer for you guys,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.884
would you consider staying?
- Yeah.

08:05.886 --> 08:09.254
I've put everything
that I am into this,

08:09.256 --> 08:12.457
but there's a lot going on here
that I can't explain,

08:12.459 --> 08:14.759
and I feel like
it's targeting me.

08:14.761 --> 08:18.763
As far as experiences go, what
can you tell me that you've had?

08:18.765 --> 08:22.300
I've come into my office,
and things have been moved,

08:22.302 --> 08:25.270
things, usually, that mean
something to me,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.005
that I was putting
my heart into.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.207
Are you sure nobody was, maybe,
just messing around with you

08:29.209 --> 08:31.243
as far as moving stuff around?
It's a big building.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.211
Nobody was
messing around with me.

08:33.212 --> 08:36.780
I had asked everyone,
and nobody had been here.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.517
Okay. So anything else?

08:38.519 --> 08:42.587
I saw a shadow person
looking at me in the basement.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.156
All right.
So did it look like a person,

08:45.158 --> 08:46.691
where that you can
identify them?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.227
I don't want to see anything,

08:49.229 --> 08:53.331
so I don't let my mind see
anything past a shadow shape.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.401
- Okay.
- I feel like he's a torturer.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.703
What's giving you that sense?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.672
It's just a feeling,

09:00.674 --> 09:04.309
a really sinking,
evil feeling.

09:07.481 --> 09:09.447
Dear, dear.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.718
I don't like this room
in particular.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.621
Someone is trying to put
good energy in here,

09:16.623 --> 09:18.023
but it's no good.

09:18.025 --> 09:22.127
They're just gonna, you know,
get sick and hurt.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.629
This dead guy keeps
messing with me.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.299
Do you have any idea
what this guy wants?

09:27.301 --> 09:29.000
He wants everybody out.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.902
Would you say people
are in danger here?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.737
Yeah, they are.

09:37.978 --> 09:41.680
This is the worst place
in the house for me.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.148
What's going on?

09:43.150 --> 09:45.216
I get sick
when I come up here.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.419
I start to feel, like,
in my stomach,

09:47.421 --> 09:49.220
and then I start gagging.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.956
I mean, is that something
that you go through

09:50.958 --> 09:52.757
when you're not here?
- No.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.025
Is anything else going on?

09:54.027 --> 09:57.262
I feel like something
physically squeezes me.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.763
Do you feel hands
wrapped around you or...

09:58.765 --> 10:02.634
No. Like, my whole body
feels like it's being squeezed.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.903
Okay. Anything else physical
happening like that?

10:04.905 --> 10:09.307
I got a scratch
on my lower back.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.543
I was at the bottom
of the stairs.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.979
I saw the shadow person.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.347
Okay.

10:15.349 --> 10:18.183
And then I felt the burn,
and I had Kelli look at it,

10:18.185 --> 10:20.385
and it was a scratch
across my back.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.854
Okay. So how long of a scratch
are we talking about?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.522
Maybe, like, 3 inches.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.957
And you didn't catch
your back on anything

10:25.959 --> 10:27.192
going down the steps
or anything like that?

10:27.194 --> 10:29.361
- No.
- Okay.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.429
I don't feel comfortable.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.631
In what way?

10:32.633 --> 10:35.133
I just want
to go downstairs now.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.003
- Okay.
- Are we done here, or does...

10:38.005 --> 10:39.838
Yeah. Let's go. Come on.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.642
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.516
I'm hearing a woman's voice.

10:51.518 --> 10:56.988
She's saying someone died here,
and it was very sudden.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.658
You would feel despair.

10:59.660 --> 11:03.161
This is where she comes
to be sad and lonely.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.929
She's not good.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.200
That's sad,
bringing up sad, sad.

11:09.202 --> 11:12.037
I'm feeling very sad, very sad.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.825
So, David,
I was talking to your wife

11:33.827 --> 11:36.361
and her partner Kelli.
- Right.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.662
They're both pretty freaked out
by what's going on here.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.197
Yeah.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.799
Do you think it's a good idea
for your wife and her partner

11:40.801 --> 11:44.602
to make this a healing place?
- I'm behind them 100%,

11:44.604 --> 11:46.037
but I think this is
the wrong place,

11:46.039 --> 11:49.808
and this place is really,
really weighing heavily on them.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.143
Do you believe there's stuff
going on in this place?

11:52.145 --> 11:53.511
At first,
I didn't believe it.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.979
What happened
to change your mind?

11:54.981 --> 11:58.850
Even now, at this moment, I feel
a really big sense of dread,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.585
like somebody is sitting
on my shoulders,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.921
and he weighs
a lot more than I do.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.622
You're talking about
physically or emotionally?

12:04.624 --> 12:05.757
Physically.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.258
And are you feeling that way
right now?

12:07.260 --> 12:10.528
- Yes.
- Is anything else going on?

12:10.530 --> 12:12.864
Out in the barn, I saw something
out of the corner of my eye,

12:12.866 --> 12:16.935
and I look, and it looked
like a black figure

12:16.937 --> 12:20.472
wearing a cape, with eyes,
just sitting on a rafter.

12:20.474 --> 12:22.741
And then, when I actually
concentrated, I'm like,

12:22.743 --> 12:25.310
"What am I seeing?"
Then it's not there.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.479
Do you get a sense of
what size it might have been?

12:27.481 --> 12:30.115
Tall, over 6-foot.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.950
I mean, did it look like
it was staring at you?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.184
Totally.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.686
It was, like, you know how
you get that creepy feeling

12:34.688 --> 12:36.321
when you're in a crowd,

12:36.323 --> 12:39.224
and you got that one dude
just staring at you?

12:39.226 --> 12:40.625
- That's what it felt like?
- Yeah.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.427
And you're wondering like,
"Why is he staring at me?"

12:42.429 --> 12:43.928
So now that we are here,
what are you hoping

12:43.930 --> 12:45.296
we could do for you?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.465
I want whatever is here gone.
I don't know what to do.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.134
I've tried everything.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.908
I feel like somebody, like,
living out here.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.077
You know, there's a lot
of wandering dead,

12:59.079 --> 13:01.045
I guess I would say.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.250
Here I'm seeing a lot of, like,
shadow people.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.622
They're not good.

13:10.624 --> 13:14.993
They make me feel uneasy,
and I don't know.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.262
It's almost like they're
all standing at bay.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.630
How many do you see?

13:18.632 --> 13:21.132
About 12. 13, maybe.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.703
I- I-I hear deadly intentions.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.511
So, Nevin, I was talking
to both your parents,

13:33.513 --> 13:34.913
and they were saying
that,

13:34.915 --> 13:36.781
some pretty dangerous stuff
going on this property.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.216
You agree with that?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.617
Yeah.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.953
So I talked to Kelli and Dave's
kids out in the barn...

13:41.955 --> 13:44.756
I would get this really just
weird feeling like somebody

13:44.758 --> 13:46.491
was standing outside,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.693
watching me,
but looking through me.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.795
...and all of them are glad
to be out of that house.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.765
I felt like somebody
would always be watching me,

13:53.767 --> 13:56.901
and it was super,
super creepy, honestly,

13:56.903 --> 14:00.805
and I would not want to leave
my room at night at all.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.607
Okay.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.008
And I can see why,

14:04.010 --> 14:06.611
especially when I spoke
to their oldest daughter Kayla.

14:06.613 --> 14:10.415
One time I woke up, and I had
a puncture wound by my eye.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.683
How bad was it?

14:11.685 --> 14:14.519
It was pretty deep,
and it was running down my face.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.388
You wear jewelry to bed,
anything like that?
No.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.690
Is there any chance you could
have done that with your nails?

14:18.692 --> 14:21.292
No. It looked like
a clear stab,

14:21.294 --> 14:23.995
direct, like an actual,
like, hole.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.496
Now is anything else
going on?

14:25.498 --> 14:26.865
I would wake up in the middle
of the night

14:26.867 --> 14:29.334
and see shadow figures
in front of my closet.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.702
Could you make out
what they look like?

14:30.704 --> 14:32.036
They look like a person.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.571
That you could see through it,
or was it solid dark?

14:33.573 --> 14:35.006
Pretty solid dark.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.708
Would you ever
come back here and live?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.376
- No.
- Even if we fixed it?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.779
No.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.949
These shadow people
are everywhere.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.317
Yeah, there's more, like,
coming.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.785
I don't like this.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.255
I'm thinking they were people,
yeah, but they have pain.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.358
They have pain
that they suffered.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.627
They're, like, disturbed.

14:57.697 --> 14:58.897
Yeah, I don't like this.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.498
So there's, like,
a watcher here.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.801
It's like a standing post,
and he alerted,

15:03.803 --> 15:05.003
I think, the others.

15:05.005 --> 15:06.504
Very strategic.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.307
The watcher is the leader
of this group of shadow people.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.377
I think he sees us
and senses danger.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.313
Do you know if the living would
have any experiences with these?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.447
Yeah.

15:16.449 --> 15:20.418
I think they would see
the one, for sure.

15:20.420 --> 15:24.122
I see him...I think
going underneath the ground,

15:24.124 --> 15:25.823
so I think basement.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.559
Do you think the living might
be in any danger from these?

15:28.561 --> 15:32.630
I do. Yeah. I think they're
hostile, they're angry.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.999
But when they're around,
bad things happen.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.735
They're not death,
but they, like,

15:37.737 --> 15:39.604
they're with all the death.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.754
We are literally
in the middle of nowhere.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.191
It seems there's more cornfields
out here than humans.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.759
So I was kind of worried

16:01.761 --> 16:04.028
I wouldn't be able to find much
history on Kelli's property.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.464
But I just got a call
from a genealogist who says

16:06.466 --> 16:08.566
one of the original owners
has a story

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
I'm definitely gonna
wanna know about.

16:17.677 --> 16:18.943
Dave, you mentioned,
on the phone,

16:18.945 --> 16:20.778
that the original owner
of my client's property

16:20.780 --> 16:21.946
had a pretty tough time,

16:21.948 --> 16:23.081
But before we get to that,

16:23.083 --> 16:24.916
who were they
and when did they get there?

16:24.918 --> 16:27.685
The first owners of
the property in question here

16:27.687 --> 16:30.822
is the Delvaux family,
and they got here in 1856.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.991
All right. So how much of
my client's land did they buy?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.926
- They had purchased 82 acres.
- Okay.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.362
So I can assume, with all that
property, they were farmers.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.898
Right. They were local farmers,
but then John Joseph Delvaux,

16:40.900 --> 16:42.467
who was the patriarch
of the family,

16:42.469 --> 16:44.836
ended up getting involved
in local politics.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.204
So you had mentioned
on the phone,

16:46.206 --> 16:47.705
the family had
some crazy times there.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.574
So when did that start?

16:49.576 --> 16:51.075
It first starts in 1889

16:51.077 --> 16:54.679
when John Joseph Delvaux gets
involved in a voting scandal.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.014
Okay. So what happened?

16:56.016 --> 16:59.350
The assemblyman candidate
offers John Joseph Delvaux

16:59.352 --> 17:02.854
the position of postmaster
if he votes for him.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.388
Delvaux accepted the bribe.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.224
In fact, here's an article
describing what had happened

17:07.227 --> 17:09.727
at that point in time.
- Okay.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.994
So basically, this guy
sold his vote.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.865
Yes. He did.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.266
All right.
So what happens next?

17:15.268 --> 17:18.469
John Joseph gets caught
and he has to appear in court.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.204
Then he has to testify
that he accepted the bribe

17:21.207 --> 17:24.442
and also that he had changed
the election results.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.810
All right. Did he do
any jail time, though?

17:25.811 --> 17:27.310
- No.
- All right.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.781
So he gets away with this bribe.
What happens next?

17:29.783 --> 17:32.350
Later that year, his wife Mary
dies on the property,

17:32.352 --> 17:35.586
and she was 69 years old.
And 2 years after that,

17:35.588 --> 17:40.491
his son Edward dies
of tuberculosis, consumption,

17:40.493 --> 17:42.360
at the age of 29.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.796
This is a pretty busy couple
of years for this guy.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.130
I mean, what happened next?

17:46.132 --> 17:47.999
Well, unfortunately,
in 1893,

17:48.001 --> 17:50.868
John Joseph Delvaux
also passes away.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.804
He dies of kidney failure.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.705
- Did he die on the property?
- Yes. He did.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.741
Okay. So how old was
John Joseph when he died?

17:56.743 --> 17:59.277
He was 69 also,
same age as his wife.

17:59.279 --> 18:03.514
Okay. So within a 4-year span,
he goes through a scandal,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.750
loses his wife, his son,
and then he drops dead.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.984
Right.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.119
All of these people died
on my client's property.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.655
Correct.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.161
I'm seeing
the angry guy again.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.430
Have you been able to get
anything on who he was in life?

18:19.432 --> 18:23.000
I got a lot of things
'cause he's saying

18:23.002 --> 18:25.036
he owns this, the land.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.973
I do think this guy
had a family.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.643
I'm thinking he was married.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.480
I think he was really smart.

18:35.482 --> 18:39.484
I'm also getting
unethical things with money.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.721
I think he got busted.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.257
He's, like, really getting mad.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.794
There is an illness
within this person.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.663
I think that's probably
what he died from.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.401
Okay. So now the patriarch
of the family is dead.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.469
His son is dead.
His wife's dead.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.637
What happens to the property

18:59.639 --> 19:01.072
Melanie, Edward's wife,

19:01.074 --> 19:03.875
stays on the property
with her two children.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.779
Wow. Does it get better
for her after that?

19:08.781 --> 19:10.848
No. Actually, it doesn't.
In fact, it gets worse.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.384
She remarries
another local farmer

19:13.386 --> 19:15.586
whose name was Felix LaRose,

19:15.588 --> 19:18.623
and they are married in 1895.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.491
After less than 4 years,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.293
ends up dying from
the same disease

19:22.295 --> 19:24.896
her first husband dies from,
which was consumption.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.497
He was only 41 years old.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.232
This woman can't catch
a break, can she?

19:28.234 --> 19:32.937
No. In 1905, her oldest son,
Bernard, ends up dying

19:32.939 --> 19:34.972
from the same disease,
consumption.

19:34.974 --> 19:39.177
- How old was he?
- He was only 18 years old.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.746
So this woman basically
lost her entire family

19:41.748 --> 19:43.981
on my client's property?
- Yes.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.318
And she dies in 1944
at the age of 81,

19:47.320 --> 19:49.787
and she is buried along
with the others,

19:49.789 --> 19:53.191
which is only about 100 yards
away from the original property.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.625
You weren't kidding
when you said on the phone

19:54.627 --> 19:56.827
it was a crazy story,
but sad as well.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.262
Yes, very sad.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.734
I'm seeing
the sad woman again.

20:03.736 --> 20:08.439
She might not know she's dead,
but I think she lived here.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.542
I'd put her, like, 1890, 1910.

20:11.544 --> 20:15.546
She's probably, like,
40 or 50 years of age.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.014
She's short.

20:17.016 --> 20:20.751
She's overweight
in, like, a weird way.

20:20.753 --> 20:25.590
Like, she seems real ornery,
like, very lonely.

20:30.430 --> 20:34.899
She's pretty obsessed
with thoughts about death,

20:34.901 --> 20:37.902
the overwhelming feeling
of loss,

20:37.904 --> 20:40.204
and it was, like, more than one.

20:40.206 --> 20:44.909
So many people that
this person witnessed dying

20:44.911 --> 20:48.112
or went through death.

20:48.114 --> 20:52.516
From all of this loss
is the fixation with death,

20:52.518 --> 20:57.355
and that fear, like,
consumes all the time.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.549
So far, I know
one of the original owners

21:25.551 --> 21:28.653
of my client's property was
involved in a voting scandal,

21:28.655 --> 21:30.154
and several members
of his family

21:30.156 --> 21:33.157
are buried within 100 yards
of Kelli's home,

21:33.159 --> 21:35.026
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.630
Searching through old records,
I find a deadly fire

21:39.632 --> 21:43.234
that swept through
New Franken in 1871.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.602
I'm headed to meet an archivist

21:44.604 --> 21:47.138
who says the fire
was a complete disaster

21:47.140 --> 21:49.840
and pretty much burnt Kelli's
neighborhood to the ground.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.381
So, Mary Jane, I appreciate
you meeting me.

21:57.383 --> 22:00.251
I know this fire wiped out
the area where my clients live.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.119
Can you give me a time line
and what happened?

22:02.121 --> 22:06.724
Well, October 8, 1871. It was
extremely dry that summer.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.326
They were
in a severe drought.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.862
There were a number of
little fires that had started.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.197
They just all merged,

22:13.199 --> 22:15.833
and that just created
firestorm, basically.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.335
Because of the winds,

22:17.337 --> 22:21.272
you can actually have something
similar to a tornado of fire,

22:21.274 --> 22:23.274
and that's what overtook
New Franken.

22:23.276 --> 22:26.644
Wow. So, Mary Jane,
how big was this fire?

22:26.646 --> 22:31.515
It was basically 75 miles long
and about 45 miles wide.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.685
It stretched from Green Bay
all the way up into Michigan.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.421
Okay. So as far as damage goes,
what are we talking about?

22:37.423 --> 22:39.557
Everything.
Everything was gone.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.893
The whole entire community
of New Franken was wiped out.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.995
So what are we talking about
as far as a body count?

22:44.997 --> 22:47.932
1,200 casualties
that we know, for sure.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.468
- Wow.
-75 casualties in New Franken.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.869
That seems like a lot,

22:51.871 --> 22:54.472
considering the size
of the town.
Yes.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.540
How come this is --
This is a pretty big fire.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.142
How come I've never heard
of this thing?

22:58.144 --> 23:00.277
Well, primarily
because the Chicago Fire

23:00.279 --> 23:03.814
was on the same day.
- Okay.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.983
And because of Chicago's size
and national prominence,

23:05.985 --> 23:09.220
that one overshadowed
all the other fires.

23:09.222 --> 23:13.724
So I am seeing fire.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.694
Like, it feels like
a long happening event.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.962
Like, days.

23:17.964 --> 23:21.732
The land here was, like,
traumatized.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.934
Then there's this other fire,
and I think, like,

23:23.936 --> 23:26.737
100 people died in that one.

23:26.739 --> 23:31.108
This land is not good. I would
say up to 10 miles around.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.476
This is pretty big.

23:32.478 --> 23:35.312
The earth all around is bad,
bad, bad, bad, bad.

23:35.314 --> 23:36.847
I just see blood.

23:36.849 --> 23:40.951
I see blood just flowing, blood
just flowing, flowing, flowing.

23:45.158 --> 23:47.458
You know, another thing caught
my attention in research.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.161
A 15-year-old boy was killed
in a freak accident

23:50.163 --> 23:52.229
just down the street
from Kelli's building.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.931
I'm headed over to meet
with a local historian

23:53.933 --> 23:55.299
who's looking into it for me

23:55.301 --> 23:58.102
and says the way this kid died
is just heartbreaking.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.341
Well, Tim, thanks for
helping me out with this case.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.143
I appreciate that.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.645
So on the phone,
you mentioned

24:07.647 --> 24:10.414
that this kid died
in a pretty heartbreaking way.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.715
What the hell happened?

24:11.717 --> 24:15.352
On August 24, 1923,
these two young men, actually,

24:15.354 --> 24:17.822
were digging and collecting
rocks in a gravel pit

24:17.824 --> 24:20.057
just a block down from
your client's property.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.459
All right.
So who were these two?

24:21.461 --> 24:24.228
Well, one was a young kid
by the name of John Vandervest.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.496
- He was 15.
- Okay.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.998
And he was with his
brother-in-law John Brunner,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.133
who was in his 20s.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.301
And what happened?

24:30.303 --> 24:31.702
Out of nowhere,
the walls start caving in.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.504
It's, like,
a huge avalanche of gravel

24:33.506 --> 24:34.905
that just came down
on these kids,

24:34.907 --> 24:37.708
and John Brunner was actually
buried right to his neck,

24:37.710 --> 24:39.477
but he was still able
to yell for help.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.878
Did they rescue
both of them?

24:40.880 --> 24:42.813
They were only able
to save John Brunner.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.882
John Vandervest, actually,
was crushed to death.

24:44.884 --> 24:49.086
And actually, here's
an article about it.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.354
The older kid was okay,

24:50.356 --> 24:51.889
and the 15-year-old
gets crushed to death.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.491
What a way to go.

24:53.493 --> 24:56.393
I couldn't even imagine
being a parent

24:56.395 --> 24:58.662
and knowing my kid
died like that.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.130
That would just kill me.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.902
I'm hearing laughing.

25:04.904 --> 25:08.138
I think they're kids.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.875
They're just playing.

25:10.877 --> 25:11.976
Yeesh.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.545
Something very traumatic
happened to them.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.380
There was an accident.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.120
I'm feeling them buried,
but they're not.

25:23.122 --> 25:27.525
I'm feeling worried,
panicked, fear.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.366
I saw several
disturbing things on my walk,

25:35.368 --> 25:37.668
but two really stood out.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.703
First, the sad woman.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.339
She was probably

25:42.341 --> 25:47.578
late 50s to mid-60s,
very large eyes.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.114
Her chin is very small.

25:50.116 --> 25:52.683
Next, I described a group
of shadow figures

25:52.685 --> 25:55.219
and their leader,
gathered outside the barn.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.155
It was, like, 6'5"
to 7-feet tall,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.257
and then there were others
that were coming.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.732
Is this what you saw?

26:08.734 --> 26:11.435
Yes. That's what I saw.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.523
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:32.525 --> 26:34.758
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:34.760 --> 26:37.094
and our clients
for the first time.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.597
So, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Kelli.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.399
She used to live here
with her husband and four kids.

26:42.401 --> 26:46.203
I have a photo of
the whole family right here.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.339
So a couple of years ago,
she moved her whole family out

26:48.341 --> 26:50.507
so that she and her
business partner,

26:50.509 --> 26:52.710
also named Kelly,
could turn this place

26:52.712 --> 26:54.812
into an alternative
healing center.

26:54.814 --> 26:57.181
That's when all hell
broke loose.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.916
Bottom line is,
if we can't help,

26:58.918 --> 26:59.984
they're going to have
to close the doors

26:59.986 --> 27:01.652
on their dream business.

27:01.654 --> 27:05.422
What kind of healing center
do you want to open?

27:05.424 --> 27:07.691
My dream for this place
is for it to be

27:07.693 --> 27:09.827
an alternative
healing retreat center

27:09.829 --> 27:12.563
where people could come and stay
and have alternative treatments

27:12.565 --> 27:14.031
and experience healing.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.367
But no matter how we foofie
this up and make it look pretty

27:16.369 --> 27:19.370
and whatever, we can't
get the vibe that we want.

27:19.372 --> 27:20.971
Now that Amy knows a little bit
about you guys,

27:20.973 --> 27:22.640
I'll ask her to talk about
her walk.

27:25.645 --> 27:30.547
The first individual that
I encountered was a female.

27:30.549 --> 27:35.653
She believes that the entire
upstairs area is for her

27:35.655 --> 27:37.521
and should be just hers.

27:37.523 --> 27:40.791
With her is
a lot of sadness,

27:40.793 --> 27:44.795
and also,
she feels extremely lonely.

27:44.797 --> 27:50.200
There's a back part of the attic
where she likes to go.

27:50.202 --> 27:54.872
I think that if living people
spent a lot of time up there,

27:54.874 --> 27:58.642
they would take
these emotions on

27:58.644 --> 28:05.783
and they could have
suicidal inclinations.

28:05.785 --> 28:10.421
I was interviewing Kelly
up in the attic the other day,

28:10.423 --> 28:13.257
and there's some footage here
I want you to see.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.425
Here it is.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.593
I want you to...

28:16.595 --> 28:20.164
I want you to see her reaction
just from being in the attic.

28:23.402 --> 28:27.037
<i> -I don't feel comfortable.</i>
<i> -In what way?</i>

28:27.039 --> 28:29.339
<i> I just want</i>
<i> to go downstairs now.</i>

28:29.341 --> 28:30.941
<i> I'm just</i>
<i> really uncomfortable.</i>

28:30.943 --> 28:33.243
<i> Can we -- Are we done here,</i>
<i> or does it...</i>

28:33.245 --> 28:34.745
<i> Yeah. Let's go. Come on.</i>

28:40.386 --> 28:41.685
Do me a favor.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.153
Explain to Amy, you know,
what you were going through.

28:43.155 --> 28:45.355
I first feel it in my stomach,

28:45.357 --> 28:47.524
and then it feels, like,
really sick,

28:47.526 --> 28:49.993
and it kind of feels
like too much emotion

28:49.995 --> 28:51.261
that I can't handle,

28:51.263 --> 28:52.763
and then I kind of start gagging

28:52.765 --> 28:55.099
and feel like
I'm going to throw up.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.201
Kelli, you said you had
depression throughout the house.

28:57.203 --> 29:02.873
Yes, just ultra sad
doom and gloom, depressed.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.808
My daughter Kayla,
she's had

29:04.810 --> 29:07.845
emotions up and down
and sideways for years.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.046
The whole time we were
living here,

29:09.048 --> 29:11.849
she absolutely hated
living here.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.217
When I spoke to her,
she said that,

29:13.219 --> 29:14.685
once she left the house,
she was fine.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.220
- Is that right?
- She's well, but yeah.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.621
Interesting.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.056
Now all the stuff
we just talked about,

29:19.058 --> 29:20.224
including the other Kelly,

29:20.226 --> 29:22.226
is that all caused by
this old lady?

29:22.228 --> 29:25.162
Yes.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.664
Okay. So you got any ideas
who she might have been

29:27.666 --> 29:28.766
when she was alive?

29:28.768 --> 29:33.704
I would think that she was
in her late 40s,

29:33.706 --> 29:35.439
maybe late 50s, even.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.040
She was short.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.375
She was overweight.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.944
I believe that she lived here
at some point.

29:40.946 --> 29:45.182
She lost a lot of people
throughout her life,

29:45.184 --> 29:48.619
and I think that added
to her constant state

29:48.621 --> 29:51.922
of depression and loneliness.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.425
And I also got that there was
some kind of illness involved

29:55.427 --> 29:56.894
with this woman.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.562
A lot of what you said
reminds me of a woman

29:58.564 --> 30:00.831
that used to live here
named Melanie Delvaux.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.900
She moved onto the property
when she married

30:02.902 --> 30:04.935
her husband Edward back in 1882.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.839
In 1891, Edward died on
the property of tuberculosis.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.742
I got his obit.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.111
So Melanie was left here
with two small kids

30:14.113 --> 30:16.013
and her elderly
father-in-law.

30:16.015 --> 30:19.149
Two years later,
her father-in-law died here

30:19.151 --> 30:20.384
of kidney failure.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.852
Melanie stayed on the land.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.887
She didn't move from here
and he tried to start over.

30:23.889 --> 30:26.256
She remarried a guy named
Felix LaRose,

30:26.258 --> 30:29.493
but he wound up dying
4 years later on this land.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.328
Now he was only 41 at the time,

30:31.330 --> 30:34.097
and he also died
of tuberculosis.

30:34.099 --> 30:35.732
Unfortunately, there's one more.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.468
Her son died at the age of 18,

30:38.470 --> 30:41.205
and he also died of TB
on the property.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.374
Completely devastated,
and she picked up and moved.

30:44.376 --> 30:48.045
She passed away
at the age of 81 in 1944.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.614
Now get this -- Melanie
and her entire family are buried

30:50.616 --> 30:53.517
at that church that's only,
like, 100 yards from here.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.689
So I do have a picture here
of Melanie.

30:58.691 --> 31:02.125
I'm curious if this is who
you think you might have saw.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.697
I had a sketch done.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.881
Well...

31:23.883 --> 31:27.150
What's -- what's bothering you
about that sketch, Kelly?

31:27.152 --> 31:32.122
Her eyes. I don't want
to look at them anymore.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.424
I try to just block it out.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.493
That's kind of
why you get sick, though...

31:36.495 --> 31:38.562
because you block it out.

31:45.004 --> 31:49.573
The next individual that I came
into contact with was a male,

31:49.575 --> 31:51.441
and he's an issue.

31:51.443 --> 31:55.946
He's extremely strong,
very present, and very angry.

31:55.948 --> 31:59.449
Living people who are here
who are exposed to this man

31:59.451 --> 32:02.953
would absolutely feel,
like, his anger.

32:02.955 --> 32:08.959
Whenever I was trying to get
clear information about him,

32:08.961 --> 32:10.994
it was chaos.

32:10.996 --> 32:13.330
He was trying to confuse me,

32:13.332 --> 32:16.900
misdirect me,
manipulate my thoughts.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.201
I've had confusion.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.903
Like, I've had some episodes
where it's like,

32:19.905 --> 32:22.406
"The hell am I
even doing here?"

32:22.408 --> 32:25.275
He was absolutely doing
everything in his power

32:25.277 --> 32:28.145
to get me out of here,
and he poked me in the eye.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.681
He started punching me
in the kidneys.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.416
He was just trying
to hurt me.

32:32.418 --> 32:36.653
So, obviously, I think he would
be physical with living people.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.389
Poking, hitting, pushing,
he can do all that.

32:39.391 --> 32:44.861
He led me down to the basement,
so he likes that area the most.

32:44.863 --> 32:45.896
It's his area.

32:45.898 --> 32:47.864
He doesn't want
anybody in there.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.266
Well, you're describing
a lot of the things

32:49.268 --> 32:50.834
our clients are
going through here.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.169
You were talking to me about,
when you lived here,

32:52.171 --> 32:53.637
the unexplained body pains.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.739
In particular, my ankles feeling
like they're been shattered,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.207
like somebody hit them
with a baseball bat,

32:57.209 --> 32:58.608
and they felt like
they were broken.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.377
And, Kelli, do me a favor,
and tell Amy

33:00.379 --> 33:02.980
how your daughter Kayla woke up
with the injury

33:02.982 --> 33:04.848
on her left side of
her eye there.

33:04.850 --> 33:08.685
Kayla had an unexplained
puncture wound in her eye.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.654
She woke up in the morning,
and there was blood.

33:10.656 --> 33:14.458
We looked for a cause
everywhere, found nothing.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.394
I got scratched
on my lower back,

33:17.396 --> 33:19.796
and I don't know how
it happened.

33:19.798 --> 33:22.132
They want me out.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.333
Now any chance this could be

33:23.335 --> 33:24.935
the angry guy
you're talking about?

33:24.937 --> 33:27.838
Yeah.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.973
Now did you get anything
on this guy in life?

33:29.975 --> 33:33.243
It was, like, difficult to get
any information off of him,

33:33.245 --> 33:35.379
but I believe that he,
at one point,

33:35.381 --> 33:38.448
owned this land or location.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.616
He was married.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.585
He had two children,
I believe.

33:41.587 --> 33:46.123
I also got that he was
very intelligent with money,

33:46.125 --> 33:48.792
but he did
some very shady things

33:48.794 --> 33:50.260
that got him into trouble.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.763
I kept hearing the word
"unethical" with him,

33:52.765 --> 33:55.232
and that he did get busted

33:55.234 --> 33:57.901
for some of the things
that he had done.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.470
Well, it's not a lot to go on,
but you remember,

34:00.472 --> 34:02.973
I was talking about
Melanie Delvaux.

34:02.975 --> 34:04.408
Some of the things
you mentioned made me think

34:04.410 --> 34:07.110
of her father-in-law
John Joseph Delvaux.

34:07.112 --> 34:10.112
Now he bought
this property in 1856.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.415
What really caught my attention
is when you said

34:11.417 --> 34:12.783
the word "unethical."

34:12.784 --> 34:16.253
Now Delvaux was involved
in local politics.

34:16.255 --> 34:20.891
In 1889, he got caught up
in a bribery scandal.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.460
So a local state
assembly candidate

34:23.462 --> 34:26.463
promised Delvaux
a political appointment

34:26.465 --> 34:29.733
if he used his influence
to get him elected,

34:29.735 --> 34:31.400
so Delvaux agreed,

34:31.402 --> 34:35.304
but, like the guy you saw,
Delvaux got caught.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.607
He never did any time,
but he did have to go to court

34:37.609 --> 34:39.109
and testify as to what he did.

34:39.110 --> 34:42.879
There's an actual article
on it right here.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.714
Basically, the judge
gave him an earful.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.315
So now this guy lived
on the property,

34:46.318 --> 34:48.150
and he died on the property,

34:48.152 --> 34:50.719
and he's also buried
in the cemetery next door.

34:50.722 --> 34:51.987
Man.

34:51.989 --> 34:58.061
When the walk was done,
I went to the cemetery,

34:58.063 --> 35:02.999
and I felt that
some of the activity

35:03.001 --> 35:07.637
that's going on here
is from there.

35:07.639 --> 35:08.939
Great.

35:12.678 --> 35:13.877
Anything else?

35:13.879 --> 35:16.179
One of the most important
things that I got

35:16.181 --> 35:20.417
is that this property
sits on very bad land.

35:20.419 --> 35:23.019
One of the things that
traumatized this land

35:23.021 --> 35:24.988
was a fire.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.890
I got, then, two fires.

35:26.892 --> 35:32.429
I know many people died,
so I saw a river of blood,

35:32.431 --> 35:35.799
and since that time,
this land has been bad.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.102
Well, there's something you
definitely need to know about.

35:39.104 --> 35:42.506
Back in 1871, the most
devastating fire

35:42.508 --> 35:45.408
in the history of
this country hit this area.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.611
You said you saw what seemed
like more than one fire.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.012
Well, that's exactly
what happened.

35:49.014 --> 35:52.682
It was two smaller fires,
a couple of fires, that merged

35:52.684 --> 35:54.784
and then
became one major fire

35:54.786 --> 35:58.388
that actually was
75 miles long.

35:58.390 --> 36:01.057
Now the expert that I talked
to actually described it

36:01.059 --> 36:03.627
as a tornado of fire.

36:03.629 --> 36:05.028
By the time the fire was out,

36:05.030 --> 36:08.431
it had killed over 1,200 people
from here to Michigan.

36:08.433 --> 36:13.103
75 of those deaths
were right here in your town

36:13.105 --> 36:15.438
because I don't think you got
75 people in this town now.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.575
Wow.
It makes perfect sense.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.246
Is there anything else?

36:23.248 --> 36:25.715
So when I went into
the backyard,

36:25.717 --> 36:29.686
and I saw this shadow person
start to approach me,

36:29.688 --> 36:32.289
it's a watcher.
It was pretty big.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.224
and then I'm looking around,

36:34.226 --> 36:38.161
and I see other shadow people.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.729
Dead people, though,

36:39.731 --> 36:42.732
and there was probably,
I think, like, 12 to 13 in all,

36:42.734 --> 36:45.168
and I just felt
very uncomfortable.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.237
They were approaching me.

36:47.239 --> 36:52.809
I definitely felt that
they were hostile and angry.

36:52.811 --> 36:57.347
I was unnerved, and then I saw
this shadow person

36:57.349 --> 37:00.550
dove into the ground
and then went under

37:00.552 --> 37:03.720
and showed me
him going into the basement.

37:03.722 --> 37:10.193
So I think that living people
would probably see shadow beings

37:10.195 --> 37:12.996
both inside and outside.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.564
Just about everybody
I interviewed,

37:14.566 --> 37:16.700
in this case, saw shadow people.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.034
Kelly, why don't you
tell Amy about the one

37:18.036 --> 37:19.269
you saw in the basement?

37:19.271 --> 37:21.371
He just makes me uncomfortable,

37:21.373 --> 37:24.941
and I just had a feeling
like he was just evil.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.811
I don't go down in the basement
because of him.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.779
Well, it's funny because,
when I spoke to your husband...

37:31.016 --> 37:32.682
...he said he saw a guy hanging,
a shadow figure,

37:32.684 --> 37:35.185
hanging from the rafters
in the barn.

37:35.187 --> 37:37.654
Not good.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.856
When the shadow people
are around,

37:39.858 --> 37:45.161
they can make bad things happen,
like accidents.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.430
So are the shadow figures
that you saw

37:47.432 --> 37:49.032
probably the same ones
that they saw?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.433
I think so.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.003
I had a sketch done.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.512
I don't want to freak
you out, but...

38:08.120 --> 38:09.686
Wow.

38:09.688 --> 38:13.023
It just makes me feel sick.

38:13.025 --> 38:19.863
It scares me, like, a lot
and hurts my stomach.

38:19.865 --> 38:22.332
That's literally what
I feel like outside.

38:22.334 --> 38:25.602
You couldn't pay me to walk
around the barn at night.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.737
It's heartbreaking, really.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.206
You okay?

38:30.208 --> 38:32.842
No.

38:35.881 --> 38:39.182
That's a lot of stuff
that's happened.

38:39.184 --> 38:43.153
You can't do light work
in a dark place.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.946
So, ladies, based on
what Amy has told us tonight,

39:09.948 --> 39:13.450
it's a damn good thing you guys
never opened up the business,

39:13.452 --> 39:16.286
especially for people
who were in need of healing.

39:16.288 --> 39:17.787
Now we're going to answer
the big question.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.622
Can you get rid of the dead
that are here

39:19.624 --> 39:22.192
and open up the doors
to your dream business?

39:22.194 --> 39:24.160
For that, I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

39:27.232 --> 39:31.735
You guys kind of already know
the answer to this one,

39:31.737 --> 39:34.971
and I think you've known
for awhile.

39:34.973 --> 39:41.344
So unfortunately, I don't think
that it's safe to stay here.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.181
The dead don't rest.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.784
Like, they have
deadly intentions.

39:47.786 --> 39:51.254
More than likely, they're not
going to go anywhere.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.757
And they do have
traumatized land

39:53.759 --> 39:59.195
that would really like to just
be left alone altogether.

39:59.197 --> 40:01.498
You can try to push
the good in here,

40:01.500 --> 40:04.267
but it just isn't
ever going to take.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.670
The best advice
I can give is, get out.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.373
Wow. Do I just
up and sell the place?

40:10.375 --> 40:11.741
Yes.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.476
So if they would have opened
up the door for business,

40:13.478 --> 40:14.911
what could have happened?

40:14.913 --> 40:16.679
All hell would have
broken loose.

40:16.681 --> 40:20.316
I'm, like, getting chills
just thinking about, like,

40:20.318 --> 40:22.085
what could have happened.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.586
So the activity
would have just got worse.

40:23.588 --> 40:26.122
My. Yes.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.957
Well, unfortunately,
this is not the answers

40:27.959 --> 40:29.959
I was hoping you guys
were gonna get.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.127
It's numbing.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.695
I mean, I don't even
really have words,

40:32.697 --> 40:34.431
but it's kind of a smack
in the face,

40:34.433 --> 40:37.734
like, reality check,
so it sucks.

40:37.736 --> 40:39.035
I'm not surprised.

40:39.037 --> 40:43.306
I'm still really raw, like,
about everything.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.642
I think I know the answer to
this, but are you gonna take

40:45.644 --> 40:47.310
Amy's advice
and sell this place?

40:47.312 --> 40:49.512
Yeah.

40:49.514 --> 40:52.415
Yeah. We got a little too much
to deal with.

40:52.417 --> 40:53.583
I still wonder
how in the world

40:53.585 --> 40:56.219
I stayed here that long,
to be honest.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.554
I'm sorry about
the bad news, guys.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.824
I wish we had better news
for you. I really do.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.258
We're thankful.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.961
I'm thankful that
I know for sure.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.897
My heart has been breaking
for awhile over it.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.867
This doesn't mean you guys can't
do business someplace else.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.101
No.
No.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.736
We're never going to
give up on that.
No.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.572
Nobody should ever give up
on what their dream

41:15.574 --> 41:18.641
is just because
they hit a roadblock.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.376
We won't stop.
It's not going to...

41:20.378 --> 41:22.612
I'm not going to let this house,
you know, this land,

41:22.614 --> 41:24.647
this place determine my future.

41:24.649 --> 41:27.917
- No.
- It's not happening.

41:27.919 --> 41:30.453
I wish I had better news
for the two Kellys,

41:30.455 --> 41:33.590
but their best option
is to sell this place.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.392
If they do that, they can
leave the bad land

41:36.394 --> 41:39.195
and the dead
terrorizing them behind

41:39.197 --> 41:40.864
and begin their dream of opening

41:40.866 --> 41:43.900
an alternative healing center
someplace else.
