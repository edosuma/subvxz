WEBVTT

00:30.030 --> 00:32.266
Lieutenant Commander
Audry Garrett,

00:32.366 --> 00:33.867
reporting for duty.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.750
I'm sorry.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.985
I can't do this.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.488
Message sent.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.961
You have one new message.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.664
"Understood."

01:14.342 --> 01:15.509
No.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.479
No.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.784
No!

01:47.275 --> 01:49.210
This time for real.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.480
I can tell you're holding back,
so come and get it.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.852
What happened? Why'd you stop?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.155
Nothing. I...

02:01.255 --> 02:02.456
Kate?

02:02.556 --> 02:03.724
I'm afraid I'm gonna
hurt you, okay?

02:03.824 --> 02:05.659
I'm like... like
double your size.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.728
Katherine Marie Whistler,

02:07.828 --> 02:09.397
listen to me-- you are amazing.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.831
Thank you. Okay.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.567
At so many things--
yes, cyber things,

02:13.667 --> 02:15.436
decorating things,
Scrabble things.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.804
I've never beaten you, not once.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.105
Well, I keep telling you
to save your S's.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.341
But this is
combat training things.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.642
And I assure you

02:21.742 --> 02:23.511
from the bottom
of my endless heart

02:23.611 --> 02:27.381
that there is no world in which
you are gonna take me down.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.816
Look, I know. It's just...

02:28.916 --> 02:31.151
'Cause I know
all the tricks.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.820
For taller opponents,

02:32.920 --> 02:34.955
armed opponents,
multiple opponents.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.791
Well, now you're just
trying to turn me on.

02:37.891 --> 02:38.792
Listen.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.394
The point is,

02:40.494 --> 02:42.162
let me help you become

02:42.263 --> 02:46.033
the most amazing badass fighter
that I know you have in you.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.502
I do, okay? I have it in me.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.703
Yeah. I just want...

02:49.803 --> 02:51.439
I want "fighting bad guys"
Whistler

02:51.539 --> 02:53.140
to be as tough as

02:53.241 --> 02:55.976
"responding to emails" Whistler,
so let's try again.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.913
Oh, wait, wait. Oh!
Really?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.616
Yeah. A battle cry.
A... a battle what?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.018
It's a scream. It'll help.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.955
You use your voice
to propel your strength.

03:08.055 --> 03:11.024
All the greats use it.
Trust me.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.271
Yep.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.142
I think it's your phone.

03:29.243 --> 03:33.381
Uh, well, I guess we're...
done for today.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.516
That was really good.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.252
Yeah, well,

03:38.352 --> 03:40.554
you know, duty calls.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.291
Oh, yeah. Come on.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.626
Come on.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.664
Morning.
Hey.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.400
What happened here?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.234
Car lost control,
hit the trailer

03:54.335 --> 03:56.136
at what looks
to be full speed.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.638
Victim dead on impact.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.806
Ooh. That's unfortunate.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.308
Yeah.
Why did HPD call us?

04:00.408 --> 04:03.711
The driver is Lieutenant
Commander Audry Garrett, 33.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.347
Driving a military vehicle
with government plates.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.981
Even more unfortunate.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.518
No brake marks on the road
leading up to the crash,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.186
so either the brakes failed or...

04:13.287 --> 04:15.122
She didn't use them.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.290
What'd you pull?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.825
Nothing.
Car's basically empty.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.560
No purse, wallet, gym bag.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.629
Just this busted cell phone.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.864
Any idea where she was heading?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.867
Somewhere important,
judging by the uniform.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.441
No brake marks,
no personal belongings,

04:33.541 --> 04:35.376
dressed in her whites. Yeah.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.410
I was thinking the same thing.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.778
What?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.179
Maybe she didn't intend
to go anywhere.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.280
You mean like a suicide?

04:40.381 --> 04:42.583
It happens.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.187
That's odd.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.189
What?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.359
There's no officer's crest
on the cover.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.760
That's an oversight.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.728
Especially for
a lieutenant commander

04:54.828 --> 04:56.497
with over a decade in service.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.898
I'll check in with her CO,

04:57.998 --> 04:59.467
see where she might have
been heading.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.968
Good.

05:03.170 --> 05:06.106
Let's go see Commander Garrett's
next of kin.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.146
This never gets easier.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.582
Worst part of the job.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.350
Excuse me.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.251
Can I help you?

05:18.352 --> 05:20.253
Michael Garrett?
Yes.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.256
Jane Tennant, Special
Agent in Charge, NCIS.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.493
What's this about?

05:25.593 --> 05:27.160
Your wife was, um...

05:27.260 --> 05:29.463
she was involved in
a car accident this morning.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.964
Honey, who is it?

05:32.766 --> 05:33.834
It's NCIS agents.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.604
Did something happen to the car?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.606
Not that I know of.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.007
I'm sorry, are you...

05:40.107 --> 05:41.775
Lieutenant Commander
Audry Garrett.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.644
How can I help you?

05:48.048 --> 05:51.385
So you're saying this
dead woman was impersonating me?

05:51.485 --> 05:52.886
We don't know.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.022
Her body was found wearing
a Navy officer uniform

05:55.122 --> 05:57.257
with your name tags
and your ribbons on it.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.759
That's impossible.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.728
My name tag, ribbons,
they're all in my bedroom.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.696
Uh, Michael?
Still looking.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.433
We realize how disturbing
this all sounds.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.301
Yeah. Have you noticed
anything else missing?

06:08.402 --> 06:11.472
Like, uh, credit cards,
jewelry, other valuables?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.240
No. No, nothing is missing.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.008
I barely leave the house
these days.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.010
I mean, I am 72 months pregnant.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.346
Michael!
Got it.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.682
Babe, they're all here.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.351
Your CAC I.D., your wallet,
your medals and ribbons.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.619
Okay. See?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.287
This is all just a big mistake.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.262
Commander, these aren't
real medals.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.531
They're replicas.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.066
Yeah. Ribbons, too.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.670
The originals were
on our victim.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.138
Why would someone do that?

06:45.238 --> 06:47.975
Hey, when was the last time
you used your CAC I.D.?

06:48.075 --> 06:49.843
Daily until four weeks ago.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.144
I'm on medical leave.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.480
My doctor said
I had to take it easy.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.482
This I.D. is fake.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.016
It's not a real barcode.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.751
Look, I've seen them
on the island before.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.219
People buy them on the Internet,

06:59.319 --> 07:01.121
and they use them
to get military discounts.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.024
You're saying this dead woman
also stole my CAC I.D.?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.959
She didn't have it on her
when she was found.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.862
Okay, I'm sorry,
but this is insane.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.931
Look, we're gonna need
a list of everyone

07:11.031 --> 07:13.366
who's visited your home
in the last four weeks.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.570
Sure. Yeah, but,
okay, to be clear,

07:16.670 --> 07:18.772
you think someone
came into my house,

07:18.872 --> 07:20.941
stole my CAC I.D.,
my medals, my ribbons,

07:21.041 --> 07:22.776
and then replaced them
with replicas

07:22.876 --> 07:24.778
all so they could get
a discount at the NEX?

07:24.878 --> 07:27.014
We don't know yet.
But we do know

07:27.114 --> 07:29.683
that someone worked really
hard to impersonate you

07:29.783 --> 07:31.418
and now they're dead.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.427
Uh, you're a little young
for a hip replacement, Luce.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.030
Oh, just, you know,
recovering from a...

07:43.130 --> 07:45.065
good old-fashioned hard workout.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.634
What you got
on Commander Garrett?

07:46.734 --> 07:49.102
None of Commander Garrett's
credit cards were taken.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.505
No indication her I.D. was used
to take out loans

07:51.605 --> 07:53.607
or any kind of purchases.

07:53.707 --> 07:56.777
So, if money wasn't
a motive, what was?

07:56.877 --> 07:58.746
The CAC itself.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.448
The real Commander Garrett
hasn't used it in over a month.

08:01.549 --> 08:04.317
But according to Navy
security databases,

08:04.417 --> 08:07.254
the card was used to access
several locations on base.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.224
This is her five days ago
accessing a computer

08:11.324 --> 08:12.425
at Pac Fleet HQ.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.094
She even knew
Garrett's pass code.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.729
Could this be espionage?
It's possible.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.731
Nothing remotely
top secret was accessed.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.066
She did go into
the DEERS database

08:19.166 --> 08:20.801
of active duty service members.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.737
Possibly looking for
more targets to steal from.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.306
But stealing what?

08:29.577 --> 08:30.811
Bam Bam.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.880
Can I help you?

08:32.980 --> 08:36.049
Ah. We met the other week.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.752
Potential explosion.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.821
I was looking for bad guys.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.390
You were deactivating a bomb.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.693
Mm-mm.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.527
Huh.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.597
Um, you're sitting at my desk.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.165
Oh. You're Agent Boone.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.433
Exactly.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.669
So, did you get my
text about the car?

08:55.769 --> 08:58.639
That's why I'm here.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.275
And?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.947
Car was moving between 65
and 70 miles per hour

09:07.047 --> 09:08.481
at the point of impact.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.383
Hit the divider
on the driver side.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.186
Engine block crushed
the victim on impact.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.723
Any indication that the driver
tried to use the brakes?

09:15.823 --> 09:17.891
No. Brakes work just fine.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.159
So it was suicide.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.027
Doubtful.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.429
Accident?
Nope.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.432
You gonna tell me,
or should I keep guessing?

09:25.532 --> 09:28.335
The car's supercomputer system
was hacked.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.070
Received a message
from a remote location

09:30.170 --> 09:31.504
moments before the accident,

09:31.605 --> 09:33.707
telling the vehicle
to disable the brakes.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.142
How is that even possible?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.410
Oh, it's so much easier
than you think.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.613
All cars made after 2016
are embedded

09:39.713 --> 09:42.215
with electronic units
that help monitor and control

09:42.315 --> 09:44.517
core vehicle functions,
so navigation,

09:44.618 --> 09:46.519
steering, brakes.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.555
Cars have essentially become
a computer on wheels.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.790
Yep.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.224
This victim couldn't stop
the crash.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.093
Didn't even know it was coming.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.062
This wasn't a suicide.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.131
It was murder.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.407
I've never seen
this woman before.

10:07.507 --> 10:09.076
You sure?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.443
Yeah, I think I'd remember

10:10.543 --> 10:11.845
if my creepy doppelganger
came over for tea.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.715
You got my visitor list?
Yes.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.017
Uh, mother-in-law,
doula, housekeepers.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.086
And, uh, we're still
following up,

10:19.186 --> 10:21.454
but so far, no one's raised
any red flags.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.956
What about work?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.692
Before you went on leave,
were you involved

10:24.792 --> 10:26.326
with any classified operations?

10:26.426 --> 10:27.961
:
Classified? No.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.362
No, I'm a pork chop.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.864
Supply Corps officer.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.532
Blankets, beans and Band-Aids.
Exactly.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.434
Essential but pretty mundane.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.103
Definitely not classified.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.305
Can you think of anything
that you have access to

10:38.405 --> 10:41.408
that might be more dangerous
than canned goods?
Um...

10:41.508 --> 10:42.976
No, not off the top of my head.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.478
Look, I am happy to help
in any way that I can.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.314
And I'd like to get
my CAC card back,

10:47.414 --> 10:49.750
put this whole mess
behind me before...

10:49.850 --> 10:51.151
you know.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.787
I wish it were that simple,
Commander Garrett.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.622
Look, we have reason to believe

10:55.723 --> 10:58.591
that the woman impersonating you
didn't just die.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.227
She was murdered.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.998
Oh.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.434
Hey, we're still putting
the pieces together,

11:07.534 --> 11:09.336
but it is possible
her murder

11:09.436 --> 11:12.505
had something to do with
why she was impersonating you.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.107
Am I in danger?

11:14.207 --> 11:17.044
We'll put a security detail
on you just in case, okay?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.713
Let's go over that visitor list
one more time.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.919
Dude.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.721
Ernie. Not used to
seeing you at AFMES.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.022
You got a hot lead?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.457
Well, still trying
to piece together

11:30.557 --> 11:31.759
our mystery woman's
cell phone.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.260
Car she crashed
turned out to be a dead end,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.362
stolen off a used car lot
in Hawai'i Kai four days ago.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.831
Owner didn't even realize it
was missing till I called.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.466
So, basically,
you got nothing

11:39.566 --> 11:41.634
and you're hoping
Chase can help.

11:41.735 --> 11:42.702
Basically.
Right.

11:42.803 --> 11:43.737
It's your lucky day.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.605
Ignorance is bliss,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.808
but it certainly has teeth.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.077
Our dead woman
had very specific

11:50.177 --> 11:51.779
stainless steel alloys
in her bridgework,

11:51.879 --> 11:53.346
only found in Eastern Europe.

11:53.446 --> 11:58.385
Hmm. So we're looking at
Albania, Hungary, Moldova...

11:58.485 --> 12:00.487
They're Bulgarian.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.189
How can you be sure?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.224
A serial number.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.830
Can it be traced?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.799
Well, it's possible.
There aren't databases

12:11.899 --> 12:13.733
that specifically deal
in dental implants,

12:13.834 --> 12:16.036
but if I can narrow down
the manufacturer...

12:16.136 --> 12:17.971
Vessela Toska.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.008
The victim's name.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.544
I called the dentist in Burgas
and was able to confirm.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.714
You-you speak Bulgarian?

12:27.815 --> 12:30.217
Picked up a few key phrases
from my ex,

12:30.317 --> 12:32.119
Antov Kosmanitov.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.421
But mostly, we spoke
the language of love.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.457
Toska is a recent immigrant
to the island,

12:37.557 --> 12:40.027
here on an expired H-2 visa.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.494
It's hard to track down
temporary workers.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.595
They move around a lot, so...

12:42.695 --> 12:44.297
Toska's last known address,

12:44.397 --> 12:46.299
three miles from the crash site.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.802
Will you look at that?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.437
I'll alert the team.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.572
Thank you, Commander.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.574
Ernie.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.979
Right. Well, I...
I guess I'll, uh...

12:59.079 --> 13:00.713
Scalpel.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.117
What, you've never assisted
in an autopsy before?

13:13.693 --> 13:16.129
Whoa. Interesting.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.697
What?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.332
Vessela Toska with blonde hair.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.733
Does it remind you of anyone?

13:20.834 --> 13:23.603
Mm, yeah.
Commander Garrett.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.274
Huh.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.342
Brown hair dye.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.979
And lots of it.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.714
No, I meant someone else
we both know.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.885
Someone tall, blonde.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.553
I don't know anyone who
fits that description.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.622
Okay, now you're just
messing with me.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.759
Any sign of the CAC?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.295
No, not yet.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.299
But it doesn't exactly look like
a hotbed of stolen goods.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.539
But I did find
another uniform.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.341
Happy Housekeepers?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.144
Yeah, the same cleaning service
the Garretts use.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.712
That must be how
she gained access

14:05.812 --> 14:07.314
to Garrett's personal items.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.582
I thought Audry didn't recognize
her from the CCTV footage.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.951
No, she didn't.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.586
Maybe someone else
from the cleaning service

14:13.686 --> 14:15.822
stole her medals and CAC I.D.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.591
Vessela wasn't working alone.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.995
Happy Housekeepers owner
Lydia Petrov.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.864
A 20-year immigrant,
and like Vessela Toska,

14:24.965 --> 14:26.599
also from Bulgaria.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.469
Yeah, before she started her
cleaning company here on Oahu,

14:29.569 --> 14:31.604
she had multiple indictments
for identity theft

14:31.704 --> 14:33.373
and wire fraud on the mainland.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.208
She was caught running a
phone banking boiler room.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.210
Allegedly scamming seniors
in the six figures.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.080
FBI ultimately didn't have
enough evidence to convict.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.781
Stolen money
was never recovered.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.184
Sounds like all the makings of a
small-time criminal mastermind.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.053
Uh, now she's on
to something else.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.754
Ernie found two other sailors,

14:47.854 --> 14:49.456
one in logistics
and one in finance,

14:49.556 --> 14:50.958
whose CAC I.D.'s are gone.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.292
Let me guess--
they both used

14:52.392 --> 14:54.027
Happy House Cleaners
to clean their homes.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.062
Exactly.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.696
Logistics, supplies
and finance.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.331
They all have to be related.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.633
But nothing's been stolen.
Whatever Lydia was up to,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.335
it was worth murdering
Vessela Toska.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.204
Why don't we roll up
the other housekeepers,

15:04.304 --> 15:06.239
get 'em to flip?
We don't have
enough leverage.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.208
We don't even know why
Toska was impersonating

15:08.308 --> 15:10.077
Commander Garrett
in the first place.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.213
We need to get into the
Happy Housekeepers operation.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.548
Oh, I volunteer my apartment
to be cleaned.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.584
I second that idea.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.787
I mean, if-if it'll help
with the case.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.956
Okay, but we need
to get in deeper.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.958
We need to understand
why Petrov wanted someone

15:25.058 --> 15:26.726
to impersonate
Commander Garrett.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.461
Hey, maybe
that's our way in.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.563
If Petrov still has
Garrett's CAC I.D.,

15:30.663 --> 15:32.565
then maybe she's looking
for another impersonator.

15:32.665 --> 15:36.369
What, like send in another
brunette to finish the job?

15:36.469 --> 15:37.604
That's a stretch.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.039
Is it, though?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.773
I mean, even if Petrov
doesn't take the bait,

15:40.873 --> 15:42.242
we still learn more
than we know now.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.776
Which isn't much.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.278
It's worth a shot.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.723
If only we knew someone who
could pass as Garrett--

15:56.823 --> 16:01.961
fair-skinned,
athletic, tall.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.599
Oh, I see it now.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.539
Wh-When I said it was worth
a shot, I-I didn't mean...

16:15.442 --> 16:18.378
Okay, you sure this
is gonna come out?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.512
Yeah, it's just a rinse.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.847
It'll come out
in a few washes.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.282
Maybe ten.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.884
This was a terrible idea.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.220
Oh, come on.
"Everyday Brown"

16:27.320 --> 16:29.222
was the best option
that the drugstore had.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.124
Not that. Sending me in
on this mission.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.226
I mean, I'm only just
getting my feet wet

16:33.326 --> 16:34.227
as a field agent.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.129
And you're crushing it, Kate.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.965
All I heard at that barbecue
was how much FBI loves you.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.368
But this is different.
I've never gone undercover.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.237
I mean, what-what if I freeze
when Petrov asks me questions?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.073
You won't freeze.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.076
You're gonna do great.
You may even have some fun.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.777
Yeah, I don't get to
play poker, Lucy.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.112
I'm cleaning houses.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.813
And that is if I succeed
at the interview.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.449
Don't underestimate yourself.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.352
Like this morning--
you floored me.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.953
Me, Lucy Tara.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.357
I've seen you come up
against a lot of obstacles,

17:04.457 --> 17:06.359
and every time,
you overcome them.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.228
Like winning you back
with singing?

17:08.328 --> 17:09.229
Exactly.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.365
But don't do
that tomorrow.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.033
The singing.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.636
But...

17:16.736 --> 17:18.605
I have complete faith in you.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.943
Thank you.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.545
Mm-hmm.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.384
What's that, now?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.653
FBI manual on going undercover.
Gonna read it.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.422
Oh, okay, yeah.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.624
I'm gonna just...

17:37.724 --> 17:39.859
sit here.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.070
Okay, but what if she asks
to speak to references?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.672
Uh, it's not Goldman Sachs.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.040
Hey, if she does,

17:54.141 --> 17:55.675
just call Ernie.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.510
Yeah, keep it simple,
Whistler, you know?

17:57.610 --> 18:01.214
You're just a down-on-your-luck
lady looking for a job.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.183
And we're right here
if something goes wrong.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.684
No, I'm good.
I mean, I was up all night

18:04.784 --> 18:06.018
reading the FBI manual.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.487
Got all the way
to "Affects and Accents."

18:07.587 --> 18:09.989
Okay, well, hopefully,
it wasn't alphabetical.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.524
Do you remember
your backstory?

18:11.624 --> 18:14.161
Yes. We talked about a...
a bad breakup, maybe a bad boss.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.728
Expired work visa,

18:15.828 --> 18:17.397
desperate to make ends meet,
dark past.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.532
Okay.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.281
Uh, excuse me.
I-I was hoping to...

18:34.381 --> 18:36.216
We don't take walk-ins.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.285
The thing is, I'm...

18:38.385 --> 18:40.420
I'm looking for a job
in a hurry and...

18:40.520 --> 18:42.255
Fill out form online.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.325
We'll contact you in seven
to ten business days. Goodbye.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.403
Sorry.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.773
I was just...

19:00.873 --> 19:02.775
I was really hoping
this would work.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.512
I'm desperate for a job.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.146
Oh, come now.

19:07.247 --> 19:11.251
No reason to have such
pretty girl cry in my office.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.622
Come, sit down. Let's talk.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.691
Okay.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.168
Tell me, why are you looking

19:29.269 --> 19:30.470
for job cleaning houses?

19:30.570 --> 19:32.372
Well, you know,
I've always liked cleaning.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.374
Organizing, really.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.942
Uh, closets, pantries.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.745
My mother used to say
that clutter was nothing more

19:38.845 --> 19:40.580
than postponed decisions.
Shh!

19:40.680 --> 19:42.449
Why do you need a job
cleaning houses?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.451
Clearly, this is not
your best option.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.186
I lost my work visa.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.821
I'm from Canada originally.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.723
Long way from home.
Why come here?

19:50.823 --> 19:52.625
Well, I had a boyfriend
who worked in shipping,

19:52.725 --> 19:53.960
and I came here with him.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.429
Then I got a job in hospitality,
but, you know,

19:56.529 --> 19:57.864
that didn't work out.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.499
With guy or with job?

19:59.599 --> 20:00.867
Both.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.835
What did you do in Canada?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.338
I-I was a baker.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.939
In Toronto.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.341
You know, uh,

20:08.441 --> 20:10.009
bread, cookies,
occasionally cakes.

20:10.109 --> 20:11.878
I-I like working
with my hands.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.046
You know, being outside
or-or inside.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.915
You know, whatever...
whatever the job calls for.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.251
Have you ever been
convicted of a felony?

20:18.351 --> 20:19.686
No.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.021
You seem nervous.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.457
I'm...

20:24.557 --> 20:27.193
Sorry, I-I am nervous. I just...

20:28.295 --> 20:30.196
Look, I could really use
the money right now.

20:30.297 --> 20:33.199
I'm just... I'm willing to do
just about anything.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.770
Okay. Interview over.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.506
Oh, please, if-if you...
if you just

20:39.606 --> 20:41.508
give me a chance,
then I can... I can...

20:41.608 --> 20:43.109
Go to this address at noon.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.211
Meet with my girls.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.381
To...

20:48.481 --> 20:49.716
To clean?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.618
No, to bake cake.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.785
Yes, to clean.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.186
It's trial run.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.255
If it goes well,
if my girls like you,

20:56.356 --> 20:57.657
then I will call you,

20:57.757 --> 20:59.526
see if I have position
for your skill set.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.294
Yes. Thank you.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.496
I-I won't let you down,
Ms. Petrov.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.564
We shall see.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.133
No.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.435
Now you go.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.381
Hear that? I got a trial.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.715
You did.
Yeah. Nice.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.584
Nice job, Whistler.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.154
Okay. Well, I mean,
I'm ready for notes.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.822
What'd I do wrong?

21:30.657 --> 21:33.159
Nothing. Uh, I loved
the crying part.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.161
Yeah. Yeah, way to
flip the script.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.196
That was... nice.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.666
Okay, guys,
just, you know, be honest.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.101
I can take the feedback.
You know...

21:42.902 --> 21:44.170
...maybe tomorrow, talk about

21:44.270 --> 21:45.872
things that are
a little closer to home.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.273
Like, keep it personal.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.542
Or just...

21:49.642 --> 21:51.378
just stick to
the story we agreed on,

21:51.478 --> 21:52.979
like... criminal past.

21:53.079 --> 21:56.816
Yeah. Not so much
detail that's, uh...

21:56.916 --> 21:58.651
unnecessary.
Unnecessary?

21:58.751 --> 22:01.020
Good news, guys.
It's gonna be a slog,

22:01.120 --> 22:03.022
but Ernie thinks he can build
a fake Canadian website

22:03.122 --> 22:05.392
for Whistler's fake
Canadian baking business ASAP.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.960
Hey, Lucy.
Whistler's here.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.797
Oh. Hi!

22:10.897 --> 22:12.865
Great job.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.167
Right. Unnecessary.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.639
What's the haps, Ernie?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.307
No idea who hacked
Vessela's car,

22:21.408 --> 22:24.210
but I did get the last
text messages off her burner.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.280
"I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore."

22:28.381 --> 22:30.182
And then someone replied:
"Understood."

22:30.282 --> 22:32.284
Yeah, 20 seconds later,
her car goes out of control.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.821
What was it that
she can't do anymore?
Don't know.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.856
But I do know she was using
Garrett's CAC I.D.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.458
to access her supply accounts.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.027
What for?
Could be anything.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.795
I'm combing through
thousands of supply orders

22:42.895 --> 22:44.130
for multiple ships.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.865
Medical supplies,
sports equipment,

22:45.965 --> 22:47.333
frozen burritos.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.669
All right, well, let's assume
that Lydia and her crew

22:49.769 --> 22:52.739
weren't willing to kill
over frozen food.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.642
But maybe something
more valuable.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.977
Gonna take me a while
to comb through these logs.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.313
The supply budget for
one ship alone is $13 million.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.949
Good news.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.017
Commander Garrett got clearance
from her doctor to come in.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.653
Baby's coming soon
but not today.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.588
Perfect.
I feel like I'm
missing something.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.023
I've asked Commander Garrett
to help us with the case.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.125
Garrett's coming here?

23:13.225 --> 23:15.962
Yeah, she's gonna help
comb through the orders.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.431
Are you okay?

23:19.432 --> 23:20.633
This office isn't set up

23:20.733 --> 23:21.768
for Commander Garrett
in her condition.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.202
Pregnant women
need things,

23:23.302 --> 23:24.871
like a workstation with
an ergonomic chair.

23:24.971 --> 23:26.072
Is there still an air purifier
in the kitchen?

23:26.172 --> 23:27.073
Hey, Ernie.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.407
We know that Commander Garrett

23:28.508 --> 23:30.610
is pregnant, but I think
you will soon find out

23:30.710 --> 23:32.612
she is one tough cookie.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.347
Cookies. That's what we need.

23:46.325 --> 23:47.594
Hey.

23:47.694 --> 23:48.928
I-I'm Kate. Lydia sent me.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.563
Where's your equipment?

23:50.663 --> 23:53.165
Oh, I... I didn't know I was
supposed to bring anything.

23:53.265 --> 23:57.003
So you... (chuckles) show up
to someone's house empty-handed?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.171
I...

23:59.271 --> 24:01.641
Sh-Should I go get some...

24:01.741 --> 24:04.043
She's messing with you.
Come in.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.179
You can start
in the kitchen.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.918
Mm-hmm.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.122
What'd I miss?

24:16.222 --> 24:18.224
So far, so good.
Chips, please.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.126
Yeah, mostly
a lot of cleaning

24:20.226 --> 24:22.562
and, uh, the other girls
speaking in Bulgarian.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.931
Okay. What are they saying?

24:25.765 --> 24:27.500
Commander?
Uh...

24:27.600 --> 24:29.902
It's mostly chitchat
and a couple of insults

24:30.002 --> 24:31.704
about the way Whistler cleans.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.606
Anything more specific?

24:33.706 --> 24:35.875
Sorry. My Bulgarian was a poet.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.644
He mostly spoke in verse.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.145
Great.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.980
Nice house, right?

24:41.080 --> 24:43.082
Imagine living here.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.621
So, uh,

24:48.721 --> 24:51.457
how long have you been
with Happy Housekeepers?

24:51.558 --> 24:53.092
Uh, a couple years.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.294
How'd you meet Lydia?

24:56.796 --> 24:57.997
We're Bulgarian.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.099
Right.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.234
Lydia brought us over
for new life.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.570
Mm.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.672
What about you, Cinderella?

25:05.772 --> 25:07.473
Why you want job like this, huh?

25:07.574 --> 25:10.577
Your nice Canada family
cut you off?

25:11.377 --> 25:12.979
I don't have a family.
Not anymore.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.615
Well, you must have somebody
looking after you.

25:17.717 --> 25:20.286
Well, I... I had a brother.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.489
He was my best friend,
but he died.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.993
Oh. How?

25:28.394 --> 25:30.229
Bomb in Iraq.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.867
He was a soldier.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.439
My family gone, too.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.309
It's hard.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.345
Yeah.

25:47.980 --> 25:51.951
You know, you think you'll get
used to the loneliness, but...

25:52.051 --> 25:54.386
you just... you don't.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.558
You know, I stopped...

25:59.659 --> 26:02.995
I stopped going to school,
seeing friends.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.898
Making any connections, really.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.534
I... I figured at some point

26:08.635 --> 26:11.203
I'd find my way,
open up again, but...

26:12.538 --> 26:14.974
I never did.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.346
Well...

26:20.446 --> 26:22.649
now open yourself up
to more mopping.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.651
Elena!
Be nice.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.653
She's one of us.

26:34.493 --> 26:37.496
Wow. That was
so much better.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.465
Is any of it true?

26:40.232 --> 26:43.703
Uh, Whistler's brother died
when he was overseas.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.705
I knew that part.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.174
Not sure about the rest.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.276
Look, your girl did great.

26:50.376 --> 26:53.445
Now we wait
and see if they take the bait.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.852
Mm.
That the spot?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.353
Oh, it is all the spot.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.955
Long day, huh?

27:03.055 --> 27:05.624
College, grad school,
DoD and FBI--

27:05.725 --> 27:08.294
never have I worked
so hard as I did today.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.862
But worth it, though, right?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.163
You kidding?

27:11.263 --> 27:13.232
I didn't get
a shred of evidence.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.367
The only thing I got
were blisters and a...

27:15.467 --> 27:18.337
I mean, a pretty decent
Bulgarian cheese pie recipe.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.806
Babe, have a little patience.

27:19.906 --> 27:22.241
This was all planting seeds
with Lydia Petrov.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.442
I'm sure she'll call.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.478
You know, Rome wasn't
built in a day.

27:26.578 --> 27:30.582
Or, in this case, vacuumed.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.218
Oh, I just want to...

27:32.318 --> 27:34.987
I just want to see
what this feels like.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.629
Pretty deep stuff
you got into today.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.798
About your brother.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.499
Oh, well...

27:47.599 --> 27:49.869
you know, you guys kept
telling me to make it personal.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.771
Oh, and you did.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.307
But some of it,
you've never even told me.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.944
I mean, if you want to talk
about it, you can.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.913
I appreciate that.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.849
But maybe we can just, you know,

28:02.949 --> 28:05.818
put a pin in it until we catch
the evil maid ring.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.153
Yeah.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.520
Of course.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.790
Whenever y...

28:10.890 --> 28:13.059
I got it.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.362
It's Petrov. Says you're hired.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.130
She wants you to come
to the office

28:18.230 --> 28:20.733
tomorrow morning,
8:00 a.m. sharp.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.435
See, what'd I tell you?

28:23.535 --> 28:25.772
Sometimes you just need
to trust the process.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.014
Going in.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.715
Here goes nothing.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.555
Ms. Petrov?

28:45.157 --> 28:47.093
Hello?

28:51.063 --> 28:53.165
Ms. Petrov?

28:55.935 --> 28:58.204
Ms. Petrov?

29:02.374 --> 29:04.376
You lied to us.

29:14.653 --> 29:15.654
You need to explain yourself.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.656
Sorry?
You said you had

29:17.756 --> 29:18.791
no felony convictions.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.226
That was lie.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.728
Who are these guys?

29:22.829 --> 29:24.263
Grand theft
of properties

29:24.363 --> 29:26.265
over $950 in value.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.001
That's why your visa
was revoked.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.405
I...

29:33.505 --> 29:35.842
Look, I-I was afraid
you wouldn't give me a job.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.176
Because you're illegal.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.411
You should be back
in Canada right now.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.213
Please, look, I...

29:41.313 --> 29:43.816
I just need to make a little
money so that I can move on

29:43.916 --> 29:46.152
and-and get my life
back on track.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.721
I may have opportunity for you.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.160
Very lucrative opportunity.

29:54.260 --> 29:57.029
It may help you
to get back on track.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.799
Yes. I mean, anything.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.801
Job is simple. Malkie?

30:04.536 --> 30:08.107
All you have to do is
put on this uniform...

30:10.176 --> 30:11.643
...and sign for some cargo.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.612
What kind of cargo?

30:13.712 --> 30:15.181
There's old Bulgarian saying

30:15.281 --> 30:17.984
which basically translates to:
none of your business.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.988
Yeah, okay.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.622
I guess I'll do it.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.524
Excellent. We go now.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.793
As in <i>n-now</i> now?

30:27.894 --> 30:29.595
I mean, don't I have time
to prepare?

30:29.695 --> 30:31.230
No time to lose. Put on uniform.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.834
Leave.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.245
Time is money.
Mm-hmm.

30:48.915 --> 30:51.350
We go in, right?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.718
She just lost her comms.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.020
We have no idea what
they're doing in there.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.554
It sounds like
they're gonna take her

30:55.654 --> 30:57.089
to sign for cargo as Garrett.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.524
Kind of exactly what
we were hoping for, isn't it?

30:58.624 --> 30:59.858
Yeah, but it-it's too dangerous.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.427
We don't even know
who's in there with her.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.929
We go in now, we get nothing.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.563
No crime's been committed yet.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.865
We got all the cargo shipments
of last week pulled up.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.234
If she's signing
for something,

31:08.334 --> 31:10.536
she's likely going
to Pier 1 in Honolulu.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.737
All right, see, Lucy?

31:11.837 --> 31:13.205
Pier 1.
That's where she's going.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.974
Yeah, but we should...
we should pull her out.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.144
Would you want to be pulled out?

31:19.912 --> 31:22.148
Let's wait a beat.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.220
Hey, something's
happening outside.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.930
We got Whistler, Lydia, Malkie

31:38.030 --> 31:40.466
and two unidentified men
heading to an SUV.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.406
She just threw us a shaka.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.176
She wants to stay in.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.677
Okay, we stay on her.

31:51.777 --> 31:54.446
Follow close behind.
Whatever this operation is,

31:54.546 --> 31:55.514
it's on.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.125
Why are we here? What do I say?

32:06.225 --> 32:07.493
I just need
a little more information.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.162
Just sign this name--
Audry Garrett.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.077
Everything okay?

32:26.845 --> 32:28.680
Yes, ma'am.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.216
Sign here.

32:35.321 --> 32:38.324
Locator 236 Alpha. All yours.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.599
SUV just stopped behind
a row of containers.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.169
No line of sight, but we just
saw two guards head away.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.071
I think they're in.
Okay. Hold tight.

32:52.171 --> 32:53.372
Where are we
with serial numbers?

32:53.472 --> 32:56.108
Swimming in them,
but so far, no red flags.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.510
BICU two triple-zero three one.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.047
Meal essentials.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.715
30 pounds flour,
750 cans chicken broth.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.385
Most of these materials
I remember procuring,

33:06.485 --> 33:08.020
but some... totally new.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.388
Okay, that's what
you focus on.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.958
BICU seven double-zero
four two three zero one.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.927
Tactical medical: gauze, tape,

33:16.028 --> 33:18.530
face masks,
decompression needles...

33:18.630 --> 33:21.600
and some equipment
I don't remember ordering.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.003
Well, now,
that's interesting.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.073
Go.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.776
Should we get out, too?

33:30.876 --> 33:33.212
I wouldn't recommend it.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.824
Is that an X-ray machine?

33:45.924 --> 33:47.259
I don't know.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.706
What is going on here?

34:00.806 --> 34:03.475
Let's just keep quiet
and get this over with.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.146
Everything will be okay.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.282
Cesium-137.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.483
What?

34:11.583 --> 34:13.252
Cs-137.
Radioactive energy source.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.887
I definitely don't
remember ordering that.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.489
You-you didn't, specifically.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.325
It's a salt-like substance
commonly used

34:19.425 --> 34:21.327
in radiation machines
which treat cancer.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.295
Why would Lydia
and her team want that?

34:23.395 --> 34:25.531
Because it's
radioactive.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.167
If extracted, just four
tablespoons could be used

34:28.267 --> 34:30.269
to build a dirty bomb
that could take out Waikiki.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.239
A black market weapon
of mass destruction.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.841
We're getting Whistler out now.
Guys, move in.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.684
No sign of the suspects.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.321
It's clear!

34:58.830 --> 35:01.032
Guys, I got visual.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.271
But you're not gonna like it.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.549
Why are we on a boat?

35:17.649 --> 35:19.451
To drop off package,
then we go back to Honolulu.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.253
Then why is our ride leaving?

35:21.353 --> 35:23.021
What?

35:24.656 --> 35:25.957
Where are you taking us?

35:26.057 --> 35:28.093
Slight detour.
Absolutely not.

35:28.194 --> 35:31.863
I did my part--
CAC I.D., uniforms, look-alikes.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.233
I want my money,
and I want off this boat.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.501
You'll be taken care of.

35:35.601 --> 35:36.735
That's not
what we agreed upon.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.337
You let us go right now.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.640
Don't think I don't know
you murdered that girl.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.542
If you don't take us back
right now...

35:46.111 --> 35:48.680
We don't need
them anymore.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.717
Get her.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.986
The ship is registered
to a Bulgarian security company

35:55.086 --> 35:56.888
known for its
black market activity.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.825
Got I.D.'s on the two thugs,
both wanted criminals.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.627
Coast Guard is sending
every asset they have

36:01.727 --> 36:03.161
to cut off the ship's course.

36:10.602 --> 36:12.204
You'll make contact first.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.539
You hear that?

36:13.639 --> 36:15.707
There's no way
that ship's outrunning us.

37:00.118 --> 37:02.721
Cinderella.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.158
Nowhere else
for you to go.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.372
Come on, now.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.240
I just want to talk.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.212
Then get you your money.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.622
No more violence.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.414
By order of the United States
Coast Guard...

38:02.514 --> 38:05.183
Hands. Hands.

38:08.454 --> 38:09.455
It's Lydia, not Whistler.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.989
I'm gonna go find her.

38:11.089 --> 38:13.359
Go. I'll handle these guys.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.077
Whistler do all this?

39:06.177 --> 39:07.779
We can ask her
when we find her.

39:09.815 --> 39:12.684
What the hell was that?
A battle cry.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.706
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.508
At ease, sailor.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.547
Are you okay?

39:41.647 --> 39:43.181
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.450
She's not.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.488
Hi.
Hi.

39:54.693 --> 39:56.061
Spinach, broccoli,

39:56.161 --> 39:58.797
lentils for folates
and brain development,

39:58.897 --> 40:00.832
and walnuts for B6.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.134
Thank you.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.970
Okay, the cesium is
safely retrieved

40:05.070 --> 40:06.472
and surrendered
to the NRC.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.574
Malkie and her men
were selling it

40:08.674 --> 40:10.341
to Eastern European separatists.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.243
Like you do.

40:12.343 --> 40:14.245
You know which one of them
hacked Vessela's car?

40:14.345 --> 40:16.081
All pointing fingers
at each other, but...

40:16.181 --> 40:19.618
Malkie did study computer
science at Varna University.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.420
Thank you so much,
Lieutenant Commander Garrett,

40:22.521 --> 40:23.689
for all your help.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.323
Thank you.
This was definitely more fun

40:25.423 --> 40:26.925
than blankets, beans
and Band-Aids.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.260
Best of luck to you
and your new baby.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.931
You know, I'd be happy
to visit once the baby's born.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.134
I have a great source
for bulk spirulina.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.005
Please tell me that's
some sort of beer?

40:40.105 --> 40:42.240
Uh, it's blue algae
that reduces inflammation.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.342
Okay, well...

40:44.442 --> 40:46.545
:
It's really...

40:46.645 --> 40:48.814
It's good to meet you, Ernie.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.882
Take care.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.953
Oh, you forgot
your smoothie!

40:55.053 --> 40:57.222
No, she didn't.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.297
I am so proud of my...

41:06.397 --> 41:07.866
Ow!

41:07.966 --> 41:09.768
Better?
Uh-huh.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.605
...my fierce warrior
lady girlfriend.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.807
Thank you.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.475
You know what?

41:17.576 --> 41:19.044
I just want to...

41:19.144 --> 41:20.912
I just want to sit
behind a desk and...

41:21.012 --> 41:22.347
just file paperwork.

41:22.447 --> 41:25.383
Exactly what you get to do
tomorrow, my love.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.119
Lots and lots
of paperwork.

41:28.219 --> 41:31.022
But then, you know, maybe
we could hit the gym again?

41:31.122 --> 41:33.291
You know, so I'm ready
for next time.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.460
Oh, there's gonna be
a next time?

41:35.561 --> 41:37.328
I don't think I have
anything left to teach you.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.797
Oh, come on.
You teach me things,

41:38.897 --> 41:40.031
and you don't
even know it.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.466
I do? Like what?

41:41.567 --> 41:43.201
Like...

41:43.301 --> 41:45.336
how to be a more open person.

41:46.772 --> 41:49.641
You know...

41:51.810 --> 41:55.847
You know, what I said yesterday

41:55.947 --> 41:58.349
about my brother dying was true.

41:58.449 --> 42:01.687
It did close me off,
and I thought I'd never recover.

42:01.787 --> 42:05.891
But being with you...

42:05.991 --> 42:08.627
it's changed everything.

42:08.727 --> 42:11.029
So thank you, Lucy Tara.

42:12.063 --> 42:14.833
You're welcome, Kate Whistler.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.336
Okay, now I better start getting

42:18.436 --> 42:20.005
this "Everyday Brown"
out of my hair.

42:20.105 --> 42:23.474
Oh, or, uh, you could keep it.

42:23.575 --> 42:25.677
For one more night?

42:27.112 --> 42:28.947
Ow.
Sorry. I...

42:29.047 --> 42:30.148
Just... okay,
don't worry.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.183
Um, yep.
: It's fine.
